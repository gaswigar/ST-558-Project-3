it
was
the
month
of
july
the
solent
ran
up
green
waves
before
a
blowing
gay
little
yachts
bounded
out
like
foam
and
flashed
their
sails
light
as
a
crown
of
deep
summer
blue
topped
the
flying
mountains
of
cloud
by
an
open
window
that
looked
on
the
brine
through
nodding
roses
our
young
bridal
pair
were
at
breakfast
regaling
worthily
both
of
them
had
the
scientific
humanist
observed
them
he
could
not
have
contested
the
fact
that
as
a
couple
who
had
set
up
to
be
father
and
mother
of
britons
they
were
doing
their
duty
files
of
with
disintegrated
shells
bore
witness
to
it
and
they
were
still
at
work
hardly
talking
from
rapidity
of
exercise
both
were
dressed
for
an
expedition
she
had
her
bonnet
on
and
he
his
his
sleeves
were
turned
over
at
the
wrists
and
her
gown
showed
its
lining
on
her
lap
at
times
a
chance
word
might
spring
a
laugh
but
eating
was
the
business
of
the
hour
as
i
would
have
you
to
know
it
always
will
be
where
cupid
is
in
earnest
tribute
flowed
in
to
them
from
the
subject
land
neglected
lies
love
on
which
they
played
so
prettily
and
charmed
the
spheres
to
hear
them
what
do
they
care
for
the
spheres
who
have
one
another
come
eggs
come
bread
and
butter
come
tea
with
sugar
in
it
and
milk
and
welcome
the
jolly
hours
that
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
music
in
them
just
now
yonder
instrument
was
good
only
for
the
overture
after
all
what
finer
aspiration
can
lovers
have
than
to
be
free
man
and
woman
in
the
heart
of
plenty
and
is
it
not
a
glorious
level
to
have
attained
ah
wretched
scientific
humanist
not
to
be
by
and
mark
the
admirable
sight
of
these
young
creatures
feeding
it
would
have
been
a
spell
to
exorcise
the
manichee
methinks
the
mighty
performance
came
to
an
end
and
then
with
a
flourish
of
his
husband
stood
over
wife
who
met
him
on
the
confident
budding
of
her
mouth
the
poetry
of
mortals
is
their
daily
prose
is
it
not
a
glorious
level
to
have
attained
a
short
kiss
radiant
fresh
and
honest
as
aurora
and
then
richard
says
without
lack
of
cheer
no
letter
my
lucy
whereat
her
sweet
eyes
dwell
on
him
a
little
seriously
but
he
cries
never
mind
he
be
coming
down
himself
some
morning
he
has
only
to
know
her
and
all
well
eh
and
so
saying
he
puts
a
hand
beneath
her
chin
and
seems
to
frame
her
fair
face
in
fancy
she
smiling
up
to
be
looked
at
but
one
thing
i
do
want
to
ask
my
darling
says
lucy
and
dropped
into
his
bosom
with
hands
of
petition
take
me
on
board
his
yacht
with
him
not
leave
me
with
those
people
will
he
i
a
good
sailor
he
knows
the
best
afloat
laughs
richard
hugging
her
but
you
know
you
darling
bit
of
a
sailor
they
do
allow
more
than
a
certain
number
on
board
for
the
race
and
if
they
hear
you
been
with
me
there
be
cries
of
foul
play
besides
there
lady
judith
to
talk
to
you
about
austin
and
lord
mountfalcon
compliments
for
you
to
listen
to
and
morton
to
take
care
of
you
lucy
eyes
fixed
sideways
an
instant
i
hope
i
do
frown
and
blush
as
i
did
she
said
screwing
her
pliable
brows
up
to
him
winningly
and
he
bent
his
cheek
against
hers
and
murmured
something
delicious
and
we
shall
be
separated
for
how
many
hours
one
two
three
hours
she
pouted
to
his
flatteries
and
then
i
shall
come
on
board
to
receive
my
bride
congratulations
and
then
my
husband
will
talk
all
the
time
to
lady
judith
and
then
i
shall
see
my
wife
frowning
and
blushing
at
lord
mountfalcon
am
i
so
foolish
richard
she
forgot
her
trifling
to
ask
in
an
earnest
way
and
had
another
aurorean
kiss
just
brushing
the
dew
on
her
lips
for
answer
after
hiding
a
month
in
shyest
shade
the
pair
of
happy
sinners
had
wandered
forth
one
day
to
look
on
men
and
marvel
at
them
and
had
chanced
to
meet
morton
of
poer
hall
austin
wentworth
friend
and
uncle
morton
had
once
been
intimate
with
the
baronet
but
had
given
him
up
for
many
years
as
impracticable
and
hopeless
for
which
reason
he
was
the
more
inclined
to
regard
richard
misdemeanour
charitably
and
to
lay
the
faults
of
the
son
on
the
father
and
thinking
society
to
be
the
one
thing
requisite
to
the
young
man
he
had
introduced
him
to
the
people
he
knew
in
the
island
among
others
to
the
lady
judith
felle
a
fair
young
dame
who
introduced
him
to
lord
mountfalcon
a
puissant
nobleman
who
introduced
him
to
the
yachtsmen
beginning
to
congregate
so
that
in
a
few
weeks
he
found
himself
in
the
centre
of
a
brilliant
company
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
tasted
what
it
was
to
have
free
intercourse
with
his
of
both
sews
the
son
of
a
system
was
therefore
launched
not
only
through
the
surf
but
in
deep
waters
now
the
baronet
had
so
far
compromised
between
the
recurrence
of
his
softer
feelings
and
the
suggestions
of
his
new
familiar
that
he
had
determined
to
act
toward
richard
with
justness
the
world
called
it
magnanimity
and
even
lady
blandish
had
some
thoughts
of
the
same
kind
when
she
heard
that
he
had
decreed
to
richard
a
handsome
allowance
and
had
scouted
doria
proposal
for
him
to
contest
the
legality
of
the
marriage
but
sir
austin
knew
well
he
was
simply
just
in
not
withholding
money
from
a
youth
so
situated
and
here
again
the
world
deceived
him
by
embellishing
his
conduct
for
what
is
it
to
be
just
to
whom
we
love
he
knew
it
was
not
magnanimous
but
the
cry
of
the
world
somehow
fortified
him
in
the
conceit
that
in
dealing
perfect
justice
to
his
son
he
was
doing
all
that
was
possible
because
so
much
more
than
common
fathers
would
have
done
he
had
shut
his
heart
consequently
richard
did
not
want
money
what
he
wanted
more
and
did
not
get
was
a
word
from
his
father
and
though
he
said
nothing
to
sadden
his
young
bride
she
felt
how
much
it
preyed
upon
him
to
be
at
variance
with
the
man
whom
now
that
he
had
offended
him
and
gone
against
him
he
would
have
fallen
on
his
knees
to
the
man
who
was
as
no
other
man
to
him
she
heard
him
of
nights
when
she
lay
by
his
side
and
the
darkness
and
the
broken
mutterings
of
those
nights
clothed
the
figure
of
the
strange
stern
man
in
her
mind
not
that
it
affected
the
appetites
of
the
pretty
pair
we
must
not
expect
that
of
cupid
enthroned
and
in
condition
under
the
influence
of
too
the
files
of
laugh
at
such
an
idea
still
the
worm
did
gnaw
them
judge
then
of
their
delight
when
on
this
pleasant
morning
as
they
were
issuing
from
the
garden
of
their
cottage
to
go
down
to
the
sea
they
caught
sight
of
tom
bakewell
rushing
up
the
road
with
a
portmanteau
on
his
shoulders
and
some
distance
behind
him
discerned
adrian
it
all
right
shouted
richard
and
ran
off
to
meet
him
and
never
left
his
hand
till
he
had
hauled
him
up
firing
questions
at
him
all
the
way
to
where
lucy
stood
lucy
this
is
adrian
my
cousin
is
he
an
angel
his
eyes
seemed
to
add
while
lucy
clearly
answered
that
he
is
the
angel
ceremoniously
bowed
to
her
and
acted
with
reserved
unction
the
benefactor
he
saw
in
their
greetings
i
think
we
are
not
strangers
he
was
good
enough
to
remark
and
very
quickly
let
them
know
he
had
not
breakfasted
on
hearing
which
they
hurried
him
into
the
house
and
lucy
put
herself
in
motion
to
have
him
served
dear
old
rady
said
richard
tugging
at
his
hand
again
how
glad
i
am
you
come
i
do
mind
telling
you
we
been
horridly
wretched
six
seven
eight
nine
eggs
was
adrian
comment
on
a
survey
of
the
why
would
he
write
why
did
he
answer
one
of
my
letters
but
here
you
are
so
i
do
mind
now
he
wants
to
see
us
does
he
go
up
i
a
match
on
at
eleven
my
little
yacht
i
called
her
the
against
fred
cuirie
i
shall
beat
but
whether
i
do
or
not
we
go
up
what
the
news
what
are
they
all
doing
my
dear
boy
adrian
returned
sitting
comfortably
down
let
me
put
myself
a
little
more
on
an
equal
footing
with
you
before
i
undertake
to
reply
half
that
number
of
eggs
will
be
sufficient
for
an
unmarried
man
and
then
we
talk
they
all
very
well
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
after
the
shaking
my
total
vacuity
has
had
this
morning
i
came
over
by
the
first
boat
and
the
sea
the
sea
has
made
me
love
mother
earth
and
desire
of
her
fruits
richard
fretted
restlessly
opposite
his
cool
relative
adrian
what
did
he
say
when
he
heard
of
it
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
words
he
said
well
says
the
sage
my
son
is
the
small
change
of
silence
he
said
less
than
i
do
that
how
he
took
it
cried
richard
and
plunged
in
meditation
soon
the
table
was
cleared
and
laid
out
afresh
and
lucy
preceded
the
maid
bearing
eggs
on
the
tray
and
sat
down
unbonneted
and
like
a
housewife
to
pour
out
the
tea
for
him
now
we
commence
said
adrian
tapping
his
egg
with
meditative
cheerfulness
but
his
expression
soon
changed
to
one
of
pain
all
the
more
alarming
for
his
benevolent
efforts
to
conceal
it
could
it
be
possible
the
egg
was
bad
oh
horror
lucy
watched
him
and
waited
in
trepidation
this
egg
has
boiled
three
minutes
and
he
observed
ceasing
to
contemplate
it
dear
dear
said
lucy
i
boiled
them
myself
exactly
that
time
richard
likes
them
so
and
you
like
them
hard
mr
harley
on
the
contrary
i
like
them
soft
two
minutes
and
a
half
or
quarters
at
the
outside
an
egg
should
never
rashly
verge
upon
three
minutes
is
the
excess
of
temerity
if
richard
had
told
me
if
i
had
only
known
the
lovely
little
hostess
interjected
ruefully
biting
her
lip
we
must
expect
him
to
pay
attention
to
such
matters
said
adrian
trying
to
smile
hang
it
there
are
more
eggs
in
the
house
cried
richard
and
pulled
savagely
at
the
bell
lucy
jumped
up
saying
oh
yes
i
will
go
and
boil
some
exactly
the
time
you
like
pray
let
me
go
mr
harley
adrian
restrained
her
departure
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
no
he
said
i
will
be
ruled
by
richard
tastes
and
heaven
grant
me
his
digestion
lucy
threw
a
sad
look
at
richard
who
stretched
on
a
sofa
and
left
the
burden
of
the
entertainment
entirely
to
her
the
eggs
were
a
melancholy
beginning
but
her
ardour
to
please
adrian
would
not
be
damped
and
she
deeply
admired
his
resignation
if
she
failed
in
pleasing
this
glorious
herald
of
peace
no
matter
by
what
small
misadventure
she
apprehended
calamity
so
there
sat
this
fair
dove
with
brows
at
work
above
her
serious
smiling
blue
eyes
covertly
studying
every
aspect
of
the
faced
epicure
that
she
might
learn
to
propitiate
him
he
shall
not
think
me
timid
and
stupid
thought
this
brave
girl
and
indeed
adrian
was
astonished
to
find
that
she
could
both
chat
and
be
useful
as
well
as
look
ornamental
when
he
had
finished
one
egg
behold
two
fresh
ones
came
in
boiled
according
to
his
prescription
she
had
quietly
given
her
orders
to
the
maid
and
he
had
them
without
fuss
possibly
his
look
of
dismay
at
the
offending
eggs
had
not
been
altogether
involuntary
and
her
woman
instinct
inexperienced
as
she
was
may
have
told
her
that
he
had
come
prepared
to
be
not
very
well
satisfied
with
anything
in
cottage
there
was
mental
faculty
in
those
pliable
brows
to
see
through
and
combat
an
unwitting
wise
youth
how
much
she
had
achieved
already
she
partly
divined
when
adrian
said
i
think
now
i
in
case
to
answer
your
questions
my
dear
boy
thanks
to
richard
and
he
bowed
to
her
his
first
direct
acknowledgment
of
her
position
lucy
thrilled
with
pleasure
ah
cried
richard
and
settled
easily
on
his
back
to
begin
the
pilgrim
has
lost
his
and
has
been
persuaded
to
offer
a
reward
which
shall
maintain
the
happy
finder
thereof
in
an
asylum
for
life
benson
superlative
benson
has
turned
his
shoulders
upon
raynham
none
know
whither
he
has
departed
it
is
believed
that
the
sole
surviving
member
of
the
sect
of
the
is
under
a
total
eclipse
of
woman
benson
gone
richard
exclaimed
what
a
tremendous
time
it
seems
since
i
left
raynham
so
it
is
my
dear
boy
the
honeymoon
is
mahomet
minute
or
say
the
persian
king
that
you
read
of
in
the
story
you
dip
your
head
in
it
and
when
you
draw
it
out
you
discover
that
you
have
lived
a
life
to
resume
your
uncle
algernon
still
roams
in
pursuit
of
the
lost
one
i
should
say
hops
your
uncle
hippias
has
a
new
and
most
perplexing
symptom
a
determination
of
to
the
nose
ever
since
your
generous
present
to
him
though
he
declares
he
never
consumed
a
morsel
of
it
he
has
been
under
the
distressing
illusion
that
his
nose
is
enormous
and
i
assure
you
he
exhibits
quite
a
maidenly
timidity
in
following
it
through
a
doorway
for
instance
he
complains
of
its
terrible
weight
i
have
conceived
that
benson
invisible
might
be
sitting
on
it
his
hand
and
the
doctor
are
in
hourly
consultation
with
it
but
i
fear
it
will
not
grow
smaller
the
pilgrim
has
begotten
upon
it
a
new
aphorism
that
size
is
a
matter
of
opinion
poor
uncle
hippy
said
richard
i
wonder
he
does
believe
in
magic
there
nothing
supernatural
to
rival
the
wonderful
sensations
he
does
believe
in
good
god
fancy
coming
to
that
i
sure
i
very
sorry
lucy
protested
but
i
ca
help
laughing
charming
to
the
wise
youth
her
pretty
laughter
sounded
the
pilgrim
has
your
notion
richard
whom
does
he
not
forestall
dyspepsia
is
the
apparatus
of
illusions
and
he
accuses
the
ages
that
put
faith
in
sorcery
of
universal
indigestion
which
may
have
been
the
case
owing
to
their
infamous
cookery
he
says
again
if
you
remember
that
our
own
age
is
travelling
back
to
darkness
and
ignorance
through
dyspepsia
he
lays
the
seat
of
wisdom
in
the
centre
of
our
system
richard
for
which
reason
you
will
understand
how
sensible
i
am
of
the
vast
obligation
i
am
under
to
you
at
the
present
moment
for
your
especial
care
of
mine
richard
looked
on
at
lucy
little
triumph
attributing
subjugation
to
her
beauty
and
sweetness
she
had
latterly
received
a
great
many
compliments
on
that
score
which
she
did
not
care
to
hear
and
adrian
homage
to
a
practical
quality
was
far
pleasanter
to
the
young
wife
who
shrewdly
guessed
that
her
beauty
would
not
help
her
much
in
the
struggle
she
had
now
to
maintain
adrian
continuing
to
lecture
on
the
excelling
virtues
of
wise
cookery
a
thought
struck
her
where
where
had
she
tossed
berry
book
so
that
all
about
the
said
richard
all
replied
adrian
or
stay
you
know
clare
going
to
be
married
not
your
aunt
helen
oh
bother
my
aunt
helen
what
do
you
think
she
had
the
impertinence
to
write
but
never
mind
is
it
to
ralph
your
aunt
helen
i
was
going
to
say
my
dear
boy
is
an
extraordinary
woman
it
was
from
her
originally
that
the
pilgrim
first
learnt
to
call
the
female
the
practical
animal
he
studies
us
all
you
know
the
pilgrim
scrip
is
the
abstract
portraiture
of
his
surrounding
relatives
well
your
aunt
helen
doria
battledoria
laughed
being
foiled
in
a
little
pet
scheme
of
her
own
call
it
a
system
if
you
like
of
some
ten
or
fifteen
years
standing
with
regard
to
miss
clare
the
fair
shuttlecockiana
instead
of
fretting
like
a
man
and
questioning
providence
and
turning
herself
and
everybody
else
inside
out
and
seeing
the
world
upside
down
what
does
the
practical
animal
do
she
wanted
to
marry
her
to
somebody
she
could
marry
her
to
so
she
resolved
instantly
to
marry
her
to
somebody
she
could
marry
her
to
and
as
old
gentlemen
enter
into
these
transactions
with
the
practical
animal
the
most
readily
she
fixed
upon
an
old
gentleman
an
unmarried
old
gentleman
a
rich
old
gentleman
and
now
a
captive
old
gentleman
the
ceremony
takes
place
in
about
a
week
from
the
present
time
no
doubt
you
will
receive
your
invitation
in
a
day
or
two
and
that
cold
icy
wretched
clare
has
consented
to
marry
an
old
man
groaned
richard
i
put
a
stop
to
that
when
i
go
to
town
richard
got
up
and
strode
about
the
room
then
he
bethought
him
it
was
time
to
go
on
board
and
make
preparations
i
off
he
said
adrian
you
take
her
she
goes
in
the
empress
mountfalcon
vessel
he
starts
us
a
little
such
a
beauty
i
have
one
like
her
some
day
darling
he
whispered
to
lucy
and
his
hand
and
eyes
lingered
on
her
and
hers
on
him
seeking
to
make
up
for
the
priceless
kiss
they
were
debarred
from
but
she
quickly
looked
away
from
him
as
he
held
her
adrian
stood
silent
his
brows
were
up
and
his
mouth
dubiously
contracted
he
spoke
at
last
go
on
the
water
yes
it
only
to
helen
short
and
sharp
do
you
grudge
me
the
nourishment
my
poor
system
has
just
received
my
son
oh
bother
your
system
put
on
your
hat
and
come
along
i
put
you
on
board
in
my
boat
richard
i
have
already
paid
the
penalty
of
them
who
are
condemned
to
come
to
an
island
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
i
will
meet
you
there
when
you
return
and
take
up
the
tale
of
the
tritons
but
though
i
forfeit
the
pleasure
of
richard
company
i
refuse
to
quit
the
land
yes
oh
mr
harley
lucy
broke
from
her
husband
and
i
will
stay
with
you
if
you
please
i
do
want
to
go
among
those
people
and
we
can
see
it
all
from
the
shore
dearest
i
do
want
to
go
you
do
mind
of
course
i
will
go
if
you
wish
but
i
would
so
much
rather
stay
and
she
lengthened
her
plea
in
her
attitude
and
look
to
melt
the
discontent
she
saw
gathering
adrian
protested
that
she
had
much
better
go
that
he
could
amuse
himself
very
well
till
their
return
and
so
forth
but
she
had
schemes
in
her
pretty
head
and
held
to
it
to
be
allowed
to
stay
in
spite
of
lord
mountfalcon
disappointment
cited
by
richard
and
at
the
great
risk
of
vexing
her
darling
as
she
saw
richard
pished
and
glanced
contemptuously
at
adrian
he
gave
way
ungraciously
there
do
as
you
like
get
your
things
ready
to
leave
this
evening
no
i
not
angry
who
could
be
he
seemed
as
he
looked
up
from
her
modest
fondling
to
ask
adrian
and
seized
the
indemnity
of
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
which
however
did
not
immediately
disperse
the
shade
of
annoyance
he
felt
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
such
a
day
as
this
and
a
fellow
refuses
to
come
on
the
water
well
come
along
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
adrian
angelic
quality
had
quite
worn
off
to
him
he
never
thought
of
devoting
himself
to
make
the
most
of
the
material
there
was
but
somebody
else
did
and
that
fair
somebody
succeeded
wonderfully
in
a
few
short
hours
she
induced
adrian
to
reflect
that
the
baronet
had
only
to
see
her
and
the
family
muddle
would
be
smoothed
at
once
he
came
to
it
by
degrees
still
the
gradations
were
rapid
her
manner
he
liked
she
was
certainly
a
nice
picture
best
of
all
she
was
sensible
he
forgot
the
farmer
niece
in
her
she
was
so
very
sensible
she
appeared
really
to
understand
that
it
was
a
woman
duty
to
know
how
to
cook
but
the
difficulty
was
by
what
means
the
baronet
could
be
brought
to
consent
to
see
her
he
had
not
yet
consented
to
see
his
son
and
adrian
spurred
by
lady
blandish
had
ventured
something
in
coming
down
he
was
not
inclined
to
venture
more
the
small
debate
in
his
mind
ended
by
his
throwing
the
burden
on
time
time
would
bring
the
matter
about
christians
as
well
as
pagans
are
in
the
habit
of
phrasing
this
excuse
for
folding
their
arms
forgetful
says
the
pilgrim
scrip
that
the
devil
imps
enter
into
no
such
armistice
as
she
loitered
along
the
shore
with
her
amusing
companion
lucy
had
many
things
to
think
of
there
was
her
darling
match
the
yachts
were
started
by
by
lord
mountfalcon
on
board
the
empress
and
her
little
heart
beat
after
richard
straining
sails
then
there
was
the
strangeness
of
walking
with
a
relative
of
richard
one
who
had
lived
by
his
side
so
long
and
the
thought
that
perhaps
this
night
she
would
have
to
appear
before
the
dreaded
father
of
her
husband
o
mr
harley
she
said
is
it
true
are
we
to
go
tonight
and
me
she
faltered
will
he
see
me
ah
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
said
adrian
i
made
some
reply
to
our
dear
boy
which
he
has
slightly
misinterpreted
our
second
person
plural
is
liable
to
misconstruction
by
an
ardent
mind
i
said
you
and
he
supposed
now
richard
i
am
sure
you
will
understand
me
just
at
present
perhaps
it
would
be
advisable
when
the
father
and
son
have
settled
their
accounts
the
ca
be
a
lucy
threw
up
her
blue
eyes
a
delight
at
the
chance
of
a
respite
from
the
awful
interview
made
her
quickly
apprehensive
o
harley
you
think
he
should
go
alone
first
well
that
is
my
notion
but
the
fact
is
he
is
such
an
excellent
husband
that
i
fancy
it
will
require
more
than
a
man
power
of
persuasion
to
get
him
to
go
but
i
will
persuade
him
mr
harley
perhaps
if
you
would
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
his
happiness
murmured
lucy
the
wise
youth
pressed
her
hand
with
lymphatic
approbation
they
walked
on
till
the
yachts
had
rounded
the
point
is
it
mr
harley
she
asked
with
some
trouble
in
her
voice
now
that
her
darling
was
out
of
sight
i
do
imagine
your
eloquence
even
will
get
him
to
leave
you
adrian
replied
gallantly
besides
i
must
speak
for
myself
to
achieve
the
passage
to
an
island
is
enough
for
one
day
no
necessity
exists
for
any
hurry
except
in
the
brain
of
that
impetuous
boy
you
must
correct
it
richard
men
are
made
to
be
managed
and
women
are
born
managers
now
if
you
were
to
let
him
know
that
you
do
want
to
go
night
and
let
him
guess
after
a
day
or
two
that
you
would
very
much
rather
you
might
affect
a
peculiar
repugnance
by
taking
it
on
yourself
you
see
this
wild
young
man
will
not
require
such
frightful
efforts
of
persuasion
both
his
father
and
he
are
exceedingly
delicate
subjects
and
his
father
unfortunately
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
managed
directly
it
a
strange
office
to
propose
to
you
but
it
appears
to
devolve
upon
you
to
manage
the
father
through
the
son
prodigal
having
made
his
peace
you
who
have
done
all
the
work
from
a
distance
naturally
come
into
the
circle
of
the
paternal
smile
knowing
it
due
to
you
i
see
no
other
way
if
richard
suspects
that
his
father
objects
for
the
present
to
welcome
his
hostilities
will
be
continued
the
breach
will
be
widened
bad
will
grow
to
worse
and
i
see
no
end
to
it
adrian
looked
in
her
face
as
much
as
to
say
now
are
you
capable
of
this
piece
of
heroism
and
it
did
seem
hard
to
her
that
she
should
have
to
tell
richard
she
shrank
from
any
trial
but
the
proposition
chimed
in
with
her
fears
and
her
wishes
she
thought
the
wise
youth
very
wise
the
poor
child
was
not
insensible
to
his
flattery
and
the
subtler
flattery
of
making
herself
in
some
measure
a
sacrifice
to
the
home
she
had
disturbed
she
agreed
to
simulate
as
adrian
had
suggested
victory
is
the
commonest
heritage
of
the
hero
and
when
richard
came
on
shore
proclaiming
that
the
blandish
had
beaten
the
begum
by
seven
minutes
and
he
was
hastily
kissed
and
congratulated
by
his
bride
with
her
fingers
among
the
leaves
of
kitchener
and
anxiously
questioned
about
wine
dearest
harley
wants
to
stay
with
us
a
little
and
he
thinks
we
ought
not
to
go
immediately
that
is
before
he
has
had
some
letters
and
i
feel
i
would
so
much
rather
ah
that
it
you
coward
said
richard
well
then
we
had
a
splendid
race
did
you
see
us
oh
yes
i
saw
you
and
was
sure
my
darling
would
win
and
again
she
threw
on
him
the
cold
water
of
that
solicitude
about
wine
harley
must
have
the
best
you
know
and
we
never
drink
it
and
i
so
silly
i
do
know
good
wine
and
if
you
would
send
tom
where
he
can
get
good
wine
i
have
seen
to
the
dinner
so
that
why
you
did
come
to
meet
me
pardon
me
darling
well
i
do
but
mountfalcon
does
and
lady
judith
thinks
you
ought
to
have
been
there
ah
but
my
heart
was
with
you
richard
put
his
hand
to
feel
for
the
little
heart
her
eyelids
softened
and
she
ran
away
it
is
to
say
much
of
the
dinner
that
adrian
found
no
fault
with
it
and
was
in
perfect
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
he
did
not
abuse
the
wine
they
were
able
to
procure
for
him
which
was
also
much
the
coffee
too
had
the
honour
of
passing
without
comment
these
were
sound
first
steps
toward
the
conquest
of
an
epicure
and
as
yet
cupid
did
not
grumble
after
coffee
they
strolled
out
to
see
the
sun
set
from
lady
grounds
the
wind
had
dropped
the
clouds
had
rolled
from
the
zenith
and
ranged
in
amphitheatre
with
distant
flushed
bodies
over
sea
and
land
titanic
crimson
head
and
chest
rising
from
the
wave
faced
hyperion
falling
there
hung
briareus
with
trunk
and
ravined
brows
stretching
all
his
hands
up
to
unattainable
blue
summits
the
range
had
a
rich
white
glow
as
if
shining
to
the
moon
and
westward
streams
of
amber
melting
into
upper
rose
shot
out
from
the
dipping
disk
what
sandoe
calls
the
of
heaven
said
richard
under
his
breath
to
adrian
who
was
serenely
chanting
greek
hexameters
and
answered
in
the
swing
of
the
caesura
he
might
as
well
have
said
cauliflower
lady
judith
with
a
black
lace
veil
tied
over
her
head
met
them
in
the
walk
she
was
tall
and
dark
sweet
and
persuasive
in
her
accent
and
manner
a
second
edition
of
the
blandish
thinks
adrian
she
welcomed
him
as
one
who
had
claims
on
her
affability
she
kissed
lucy
protectingly
and
remarking
on
the
wonders
of
the
evening
appropriated
her
husband
adrian
and
lucy
found
themselves
walking
behind
them
the
sun
was
under
all
the
spaces
of
the
sky
were
alight
and
fancy
flamed
so
you
not
intoxicated
with
your
immense
triumph
this
morning
said
lady
judith
do
laugh
at
me
when
it
over
i
feel
ashamed
of
the
trouble
taken
look
at
that
glory
i
sure
you
despise
me
for
it
was
i
not
there
to
applaud
you
i
only
think
such
energies
should
be
turned
into
some
definitely
useful
channel
but
you
must
not
go
into
the
army
what
else
can
i
do
you
are
fit
for
so
much
that
is
better
i
never
can
be
anything
like
austin
but
i
think
you
can
do
more
well
i
thank
you
for
thinking
it
lady
judith
something
i
will
do
a
man
must
deserve
to
live
as
you
say
sauces
adrian
was
heard
to
articulate
distinctly
in
the
rear
sauces
are
the
top
tree
of
this
science
a
woman
who
has
mastered
sauces
sits
on
the
apex
of
civilization
briareus
reddened
duskily
seaward
the
west
was
all
a
burning
rose
how
can
men
see
such
sights
as
those
and
live
idle
richard
resumed
i
feel
ashamed
of
asking
my
men
to
work
for
or
i
feel
so
now
not
when
you
racing
the
begum
i
think
there
no
necessity
for
you
to
turn
democrat
like
austin
do
you
write
now
no
what
is
writing
like
mine
it
does
deceive
me
i
know
only
the
excuse
i
making
to
myself
for
remaining
idle
i
written
a
line
since
lately
because
you
are
so
happy
no
not
because
of
that
of
course
i
very
happy
he
did
not
finish
vague
shapeless
ambition
had
replaced
love
in
yonder
skies
no
scientific
humanist
was
by
to
study
the
natural
development
and
guide
him
this
lady
would
hardly
be
deemed
a
very
proper
guide
to
the
undirected
energies
of
the
youth
yet
they
had
established
relations
of
that
nature
she
was
five
years
older
than
he
and
a
woman
which
may
explain
her
serene
presumption
the
had
broken
up
a
brawny
shoulder
smouldered
over
the
sea
we
work
together
in
town
at
all
events
said
richard
why
ca
we
go
about
together
at
night
and
find
out
people
who
want
help
lady
judith
smiled
and
only
corrected
his
nonsense
by
saying
i
think
we
must
be
too
romantic
you
will
become
a
i
suppose
you
have
the
characteristics
of
one
especially
at
breakfast
adrian
unnecessarily
emphatic
gastronomical
lessons
to
the
young
wife
here
came
in
you
must
be
our
champion
continued
lady
judith
the
rescuer
and
succourer
of
distressed
dames
and
damsels
we
want
one
badly
you
do
said
richard
earnestly
from
what
i
hear
from
what
i
know
his
thoughts
flew
off
with
him
as
hailed
shrilly
at
exceeding
critical
moment
by
distressed
dames
and
damsels
images
of
airy
towers
hung
around
his
fancy
performed
miraculous
feats
the
towers
crumbled
the
stars
grew
larger
seemed
to
throb
with
lustre
his
fancy
crumbled
with
the
towers
of
the
air
his
heart
gave
a
leap
he
turned
to
lucy
my
darling
what
have
you
been
doing
and
as
if
to
compensate
her
for
his
little
infidelity
he
pressed
very
tenderly
to
her
we
have
been
engaged
in
a
charming
conversation
on
domestic
cookery
interposed
adrian
cookery
such
an
evening
as
this
his
face
was
a
handsome
likeness
of
hippias
at
the
presentation
of
bridecake
dearest
you
know
it
very
useful
lucy
mirthfully
pleaded
indeed
i
quite
agree
with
you
child
said
lady
judith
and
i
think
you
have
the
laugh
of
us
i
certainly
will
learn
to
cook
some
day
woman
mission
in
so
many
words
ejaculated
adrian
and
pray
what
is
man
to
taste
thereof
and
pronounce
thereupon
let
us
give
it
up
to
them
said
lady
judith
to
richard
you
and
i
never
will
make
so
delightful
and
beautifully
balanced
a
world
of
it
richard
appeared
to
have
grown
perfectly
willing
to
give
everything
up
to
the
fair
face
his
bridal
hesper
neat
day
lucy
had
to
act
the
coward
anew
and
as
she
did
so
her
heart
sank
to
see
how
painfully
it
affected
him
that
she
should
hesitate
to
go
with
him
to
his
father
he
was
patient
gentle
he
sat
down
by
her
side
to
appeal
to
her
reason
and
used
all
the
arguments
he
could
think
of
to
persuade
her
if
we
go
together
and
make
him
see
us
both
if
he
sees
he
has
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
you
rather
everything
to
be
proud
of
if
you
are
only
near
him
you
will
not
have
to
speak
a
word
and
i
certain
as
certain
as
that
i
live
that
in
a
week
we
shall
be
settled
happily
at
raynham
i
know
my
father
so
well
lucy
nobody
knows
him
but
i
lucy
asked
whether
harley
did
not
adrian
not
a
bit
adrian
only
knows
a
part
of
people
lucy
and
not
the
best
part
lucy
was
disposed
to
think
more
highly
of
the
object
of
her
conquest
is
it
he
that
has
been
frightening
you
lucy
no
no
richard
oh
dear
no
she
cried
and
looked
at
him
more
tenderly
because
she
was
not
quite
truthful
he
does
know
my
father
at
all
said
richard
but
lucy
had
another
opinion
of
the
wise
youth
and
secretly
maintained
it
she
could
not
be
won
to
imagine
the
baronet
a
man
of
human
mould
generous
forgiving
full
of
passionate
love
at
heart
as
richard
tried
to
picture
him
and
thought
him
now
that
he
beheld
him
again
through
adrian
embassy
to
her
he
was
that
awful
figure
shrouded
by
the
midnight
why
are
you
so
harsh
she
had
heard
richard
cry
more
than
once
she
was
sure
that
adrian
must
be
right
well
i
tell
you
i
wo
go
without
you
said
richard
and
lucy
begged
for
a
little
more
time
cupid
now
began
to
grumble
and
with
cause
adrian
positively
refused
to
go
on
the
water
unless
that
element
were
smooth
as
a
plate
the
west
still
joked
boisterously
at
any
comparison
of
the
sort
the
days
were
magnificent
richard
had
yachting
engagements
and
lucy
always
petitioned
to
stay
to
keep
adrian
company
concerning
it
her
duty
as
hostess
arguing
with
adrian
was
an
absurd
idea
if
richard
hinted
at
his
retaining
lucy
the
wise
youth
would
remark
it
a
wholesome
interlude
to
your
extremely
cupidinous
behaviour
my
dear
boy
richard
asked
his
wife
what
they
could
possibly
find
to
talk
about
all
manner
of
things
said
lucy
not
only
cookery
he
is
so
amusing
though
he
does
make
fun
of
the
pilgrim
scrip
and
i
think
he
ought
not
and
then
do
you
know
darling
you
wo
think
me
vain
i
think
he
is
beginning
to
like
me
a
little
richard
laughed
at
the
humble
mind
of
his
beauty
does
everybody
like
you
admire
you
does
lord
mountfalcon
and
morton
and
lady
judith
but
he
is
one
of
your
family
richard
and
they
all
will
if
she
is
a
coward
ah
no
she
sighs
and
is
chidden
the
conquest
of
an
epicure
or
any
young
wife
conquest
beyond
her
husband
however
loyally
devised
for
their
mutual
happiness
may
be
costly
to
her
richard
in
his
hours
of
excitement
was
thrown
very
much
with
lady
judith
he
consulted
her
regarding
what
he
termed
cowardice
lady
judith
said
i
think
she
wrong
but
you
must
learn
to
humour
little
women
then
would
you
advise
me
to
go
up
alone
he
asked
with
a
cloudy
forehead
what
else
can
you
do
be
reconciled
yourself
as
quickly
as
you
can
you
ca
drag
her
like
a
captive
you
know
it
is
not
pleasant
for
a
young
husband
fancying
his
bride
the
peerless
flower
of
creation
to
learn
that
he
must
humour
a
little
woman
in
her
it
was
revolting
to
richard
what
i
fear
he
said
is
that
my
father
will
make
it
smooth
with
me
and
not
acknowledge
her
so
that
whenever
i
go
to
him
i
shall
have
to
leave
her
and
tit
for
tat
an
abominable
existence
like
a
ball
on
a
i
wo
bear
that
ignominy
and
this
i
know
i
know
she
might
prevent
it
at
once
if
she
would
only
be
brave
and
face
it
you
you
lady
judith
you
would
be
a
coward
where
my
old
lord
tells
me
to
go
i
go
the
lady
coldly
replied
there
not
much
merit
in
that
pray
do
cite
me
women
are
born
cowards
you
know
but
i
love
the
women
who
are
not
cowards
the
little
thing
your
wife
has
not
refused
to
go
no
but
tears
who
can
stand
tears
lucy
had
come
to
drop
them
unaccustomed
to
have
his
will
thwarted
and
urgent
where
he
saw
the
thing
to
do
so
clearly
the
young
husband
had
spoken
strong
words
and
she
who
knew
that
she
would
have
given
her
life
by
inches
for
him
who
knew
that
she
was
playing
a
part
for
his
happiness
and
hiding
for
his
sake
the
nature
that
was
worthy
his
esteem
the
poor
little
martyr
had
been
weak
a
moment
she
had
adrian
support
the
wise
youth
was
very
comfortable
he
liked
the
air
of
the
island
and
he
liked
being
petted
a
nice
little
woman
a
very
nice
little
woman
tom
bakewell
heard
him
murmur
to
himself
according
to
a
habit
he
had
and
his
air
of
rather
succulent
patronage
as
he
walked
or
sat
beside
the
innocent
beauty
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
a
smile
that
seemed
always
to
be
in
secret
communion
with
his
marked
abdominal
prominence
showed
that
she
was
gaining
part
of
what
she
played
for
wise
youths
who
buy
their
loves
are
not
unwilling
when
opportunity
offers
to
try
and
obtain
the
commodity
for
nothing
examinations
of
her
hand
as
for
some
occult
purpose
and
unctuous
pattings
of
the
same
were
not
infrequent
adrian
waxed
now
and
then
anacreontic
in
his
compliments
lucy
would
say
that
worse
than
lord
mountfalcon
better
english
than
the
noble
lord
deigns
to
employ
allow
that
quoth
adrian
he
is
very
kind
said
lucy
to
all
save
to
our
noble
vernacular
added
adrian
he
seems
to
scent
a
rival
to
his
dignity
there
it
may
be
that
adrian
scented
a
rival
to
his
lymphatic
emotions
we
are
at
our
ease
here
in
excellent
society
he
wrote
to
lady
blandish
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
the
huron
has
a
happy
fortune
or
a
superlative
instinct
blindfold
he
has
seized
upon
a
suitable
mate
she
can
look
at
a
lord
and
cook
for
an
epicure
besides
kitchener
she
reads
and
comments
on
the
pilgrim
scrip
the
chapter
of
course
takes
her
fancy
that
picture
of
woman
by
reverence
and
coloured
by
love
she
thinks
beautiful
and
repeats
it
tossing
up
pretty
eyes
also
the
lover
petition
me
purity
to
be
worthy
the
good
in
her
and
grant
her
patience
to
reach
the
good
in
me
is
quite
taking
to
hear
her
lisp
it
be
sure
that
i
am
repeating
the
petition
i
make
her
read
me
her
choice
passages
she
has
not
a
bad
voice
the
lady
judith
i
spoke
of
is
austin
miss
menteith
married
to
the
incapable
old
lord
felle
or
fellow
as
the
wits
here
call
him
lord
mountfalcon
is
his
cousin
and
her
what
she
has
been
trying
to
find
out
but
they
have
both
got
over
their
perplexity
and
act
respectively
the
bad
man
reproved
and
the
chaste
counsellor
a
position
in
which
our
young
couple
found
them
and
haply
diverted
its
perils
they
had
quite
taken
them
in
hand
lady
judith
undertakes
to
cure
the
fair
papist
of
a
pretty
modest
trick
of
frowning
and
blushing
when
addressed
and
his
lordship
directs
the
exuberant
energies
of
the
original
man
is
thus
we
fulfil
our
destinies
and
are
content
sometimes
they
change
pupils
my
lord
educates
the
little
dame
and
my
lady
the
hope
of
raynham
joy
and
blessings
unto
all
as
the
german
poet
sings
lady
judith
accepted
the
hand
of
her
decrepit
lord
that
she
might
be
of
potent
service
to
her
austin
you
know
had
great
hopes
of
her
i
have
for
the
first
time
in
my
career
a
field
of
lords
to
study
i
think
it
is
not
without
meaning
that
i
am
introduced
to
it
by
a
niece
the
language
of
the
two
social
extremes
is
similar
i
find
it
to
consist
in
an
instinctively
lavish
use
of
vowels
and
adjectives
my
lord
and
farmer
blaize
speak
the
same
tongue
only
my
lord
has
lost
its
backbone
and
is
limp
though
fluent
their
pursuits
are
identical
but
that
one
has
money
or
as
the
pilgrim
terms
it
vantage
and
the
other
has
not
their
ideas
seem
to
have
a
special
relationship
in
the
peculiarity
of
stopping
where
they
have
begun
young
tom
blaize
with
vantage
would
be
lord
mountfalcon
even
in
the
character
of
their
parasites
i
see
a
resemblance
though
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
the
hon
peter
brayder
who
is
my
lord
parasite
is
by
no
means
noxious
this
sounds
dreadfully
democrat
pray
do
be
alarmed
the
discovery
of
the
affinity
between
the
two
extremes
of
the
royal
british
oak
has
made
me
thrice
conservative
i
see
now
that
the
national
love
of
a
lord
is
less
subservience
than
a
form
of
putting
a
hat
on
one
image
as
it
were
to
bow
to
it
i
see
too
the
admirable
wisdom
of
our
system
could
there
be
a
finer
balance
of
power
than
in
a
community
where
men
intellectually
nil
have
lawful
vantage
and
a
lace
hat
on
how
soothing
it
is
to
intellect
that
noble
rebel
as
the
pilgrim
has
it
to
stand
and
bow
and
know
itself
superior
this
exquisite
compensation
maintains
the
balance
whereas
that
period
anticipated
by
the
pilgrim
when
science
shall
have
produced
an
intellectual
aristocracy
is
indeed
horrible
to
contemplate
for
what
despotism
is
so
black
as
one
the
mind
can
not
challenge
be
an
iron
age
wherefore
madam
i
cry
and
shall
continue
to
cry
lord
mountfalcon
long
may
he
sip
his
burgundy
long
may
the
carry
him
on
their
shoulders

out

our
richard
has
just
been
elected
member
of
a
club
for
the
promotion
of
nausea
is
he
happy
you
ask
as
much
so
as
one
who
has
had
the
misfortune
to
obtain
what
he
wanted
can
be
speed
is
his
passion
he
races
from
point
to
point
in
emulation
of
leander
and
don
juan
he
swam
i
hear
to
the
opposite
shores
the
other
day
or
some
feat
of
the
sort
himself
the
hero
whom
he
went
to
meet
or
as
they
who
pun
say
his
hero
was
a
bet
a
pretty
little
domestic
episode
occurred
this
morning
he
finds
her
abstracted
in
the
fire
of
his
caresses
she
turns
shy
and
seeks
solitude
green
jealousy
takes
hold
of
him
he
lies
in
wait
and
discovers
her
with
his
new
rival
a
veteran
edition
of
the
culinary
doctor
blind
to
the
doctor
great
national
services
deaf
to
her
wild
music
he
grasps
the
intruder
dismembers
him
and
performs
upon
him
the
treatment
he
has
recommended
for
dressed
cucumber
tears
and
shrieks
accompany
the
descent
of
the
gastronome
down
she
rushes
to
secure
the
cherished
fragments
he
follows
they
find
him
true
to
his
character
alighted
and
straggling
over
a
bed
of
blooming
flowers
yet
ere
a
fairer
flower
can
gather
him
a
heel
black
as
pluto
stamps
him
into
earth
flowers
and
all
happy
burial
pathetic
tribute
to
his
merit
is
watering
his
grave
when
by
saunters
my
lord
mountfalcon
the
mattah
says
his
lordship
soothing
his
moustache
they
break
apart
and
is
left
to
me
to
explain
from
the
window
my
lord
looks
shocked
richard
is
angry
with
her
for
having
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
beauty
dries
her
eyes
and
after
a
pause
of
general
foolishness
the
business
of
life
is
resumed
i
may
add
that
the
doctor
has
just
been
dug
up
and
we
are
busy
in
the
enemy
absence
renewing
old
aeson
with
enchanted
threads
by
the
way
a
papist
priest
has
blest
them
a
month
had
passed
when
adrian
wrote
this
letter
he
was
very
comfortable
so
of
course
he
thought
time
was
doing
his
duty
not
a
word
did
he
say
of
richard
return
and
for
some
reason
or
other
neither
richard
nor
lucy
spoke
of
it
now
lady
blandish
wrote
back
his
father
thinks
he
has
refused
to
come
to
him
by
your
utter
silence
on
the
subject
i
fear
that
it
must
be
so
make
him
come
bring
him
by
force
insist
on
his
coming
is
he
mad
he
must
come
at
once
to
this
adrian
replied
after
a
contemplative
comfortable
lapse
of
a
day
or
two
which
might
be
laid
to
his
efforts
to
adopt
the
lady
advice
the
point
is
that
the
half
man
declines
to
come
without
the
whole
man
the
terrible
question
of
sex
is
our
obstruction
lady
blandish
was
in
despair
she
had
no
positive
assurance
that
the
baronet
would
see
his
son
the
mask
put
them
all
in
the
dark
but
she
thought
she
saw
in
sir
austin
irritation
that
the
offender
at
least
when
the
opening
to
come
and
make
his
peace
seemed
to
be
before
him
should
let
days
and
weeks
go
by
she
saw
through
the
mask
sufficiently
not
to
have
any
hope
of
his
consenting
to
receive
the
couple
at
present
she
was
sure
that
his
equanimity
was
fictitious
but
she
pierced
no
farther
or
she
might
have
started
and
asked
herself
is
this
the
heart
of
a
woman
the
lady
at
last
wrote
to
richard
she
said
come
instantly
and
come
alone
then
richard
against
his
judgment
gave
way
my
father
is
not
the
man
i
thought
him
he
exclaimed
sadly
and
lucy
felt
his
eyes
saying
to
her
and
you
too
are
not
the
woman
i
thought
you
nothing
could
the
poor
little
heart
reply
but
strain
to
his
bosom
and
sleeplessly
pray
in
his
arms
all
the
night
chapter
xxxv
three
weeks
after
richard
arrived
in
town
his
cousin
clare
was
married
under
the
blessings
of
her
energetic
mother
and
with
the
approbation
of
her
kinsfolk
to
the
husband
that
had
been
expeditiously
chosen
for
her
the
gentleman
though
something
more
than
twice
the
age
of
his
bride
had
no
idea
of
approaching
senility
for
many
long
connubial
years
to
come
backed
by
his
tailor
and
his
hairdresser
he
presented
no
such
bad
figure
at
the
altar
and
none
would
have
thought
that
he
was
an
ancient
admirer
of
his
bride
mama
as
certainly
none
knew
he
had
lately
proposed
for
doria
before
there
was
any
question
of
her
daughter
these
things
were
secrets
and
the
elastic
and
happy
appearance
of
john
todhunter
did
not
betray
them
at
the
altar
perhaps
he
would
rather
have
married
the
mother
he
was
a
man
of
property
well
born
tolerably
well
educated
and
had
when
doria
rejected
him
for
the
first
time
the
reputation
of
being
a
fool
which
a
wealthy
man
may
have
in
his
youth
but
as
he
lived
on
and
did
not
squander
his
money
amassed
it
on
the
contrary
and
did
not
seek
to
go
into
parliament
and
did
other
negative
wise
things
the
world
opinion
as
usual
veered
completely
round
and
john
todhunter
was
esteemed
a
shrewd
sensible
man
only
not
brilliant
that
he
was
brilliant
could
not
be
said
of
him
in
fact
the
man
could
hardly
talk
and
it
was
a
fortunate
provision
that
no
impromptu
deliveries
were
required
of
him
in
the
doria
had
her
own
reasons
for
being
in
a
hurry
she
had
discovered
something
of
the
strange
impassive
nature
of
her
child
not
from
any
confession
of
clare
but
from
signs
a
mother
can
read
when
her
eyes
are
not
resolutely
shut
she
saw
with
alarm
and
anguish
that
clare
had
fallen
into
the
pit
she
had
been
digging
for
her
so
laboriously
in
vain
she
entreated
the
baronet
to
break
the
disgraceful
and
as
she
said
illegal
alliance
his
son
had
contracted
sir
austin
would
not
even
stop
the
little
pension
to
poor
berry
at
least
you
will
do
that
austin
she
begged
pathetically
you
will
show
your
sense
of
that
horrid
woman
conduct
he
refused
to
offer
up
any
victim
to
console
her
then
doria
told
him
her
thoughts
and
when
an
outraged
energetic
lady
is
finally
brought
to
exhibit
these
painfully
hoarded
treasures
she
does
not
use
half
words
as
a
medium
his
system
and
his
conduct
generally
were
denounced
to
him
without
analysis
she
let
him
understand
that
the
world
laughed
at
him
and
he
heard
this
from
her
at
a
time
when
his
mask
was
still
soft
and
liable
to
be
acted
on
by
his
nerves
you
are
weak
austin
weak
i
tell
you
she
said
and
like
all
angry
and
people
prophecy
came
easy
to
her
in
her
heart
she
accused
him
of
her
own
fault
in
imputing
to
him
the
wreck
of
her
project
the
baronet
allowed
her
to
revel
in
the
proclamation
of
a
dire
future
and
quietly
counselled
her
to
keep
apart
from
him
which
his
sister
assured
him
she
would
do
but
to
be
passive
in
calamity
is
the
province
of
no
woman
mark
the
race
at
any
hour
what
revolution
and
hubbub
does
not
that
little
instrument
the
needle
avert
from
us
says
the
pilgrim
scrip
alas
that
in
calamity
women
can
not
stitch
now
that
she
saw
clare
wanted
other
than
iron
it
struck
her
she
must
have
a
husband
and
be
made
secure
as
a
woman
and
a
wife
this
seemed
the
thing
to
do
and
as
she
had
forced
the
iron
down
clare
throat
so
she
forced
the
husband
and
clare
gulped
at
the
latter
as
she
had
at
the
former
on
the
very
day
that
doria
had
this
new
track
shaped
out
before
her
john
todhunter
called
at
the
foreys
old
john
sang
out
doria
show
him
up
to
me
i
want
to
see
him
particularly
he
sat
with
her
alone
he
was
a
man
multitudes
of
women
would
have
married
whom
will
they
not
and
who
would
have
married
any
presentable
woman
but
women
do
want
asking
and
john
never
had
the
word
the
rape
of
such
men
is
left
to
the
practical
animal
so
john
sat
alone
with
his
old
flame
he
had
become
resigned
to
her
perpetual
lamentation
and
living
suttee
for
his
defunct
rival
but
ha
what
meant
those
soft
glances
now
addressed
to
him
his
tailor
and
his
hairdresser
gave
youth
to
john
but
they
had
not
the
art
to
bestow
upon
him
distinction
and
an
undistinguished
man
what
woman
looks
at
john
was
an
indistinguishable
man
for
that
reason
he
was
dry
wood
to
a
soft
glance
and
now
she
said
it
is
time
you
should
marry
and
you
are
the
man
to
be
the
guide
and
helper
of
a
young
woman
john
you
are
well
preserved
younger
than
most
of
the
young
men
of
our
day
you
are
eminently
domestic
a
good
son
and
will
be
a
good
husband
and
good
father
some
one
you
must
what
do
you
think
of
clare
for
a
wife
for
you
at
first
john
todhunter
thought
it
would
be
very
much
like
his
marrying
a
baby
however
he
listened
to
it
and
that
was
enough
for
doria
she
went
down
to
john
mother
and
consulted
with
her
on
the
propriety
of
the
scheme
of
wedding
her
daughter
to
john
in
accordance
with
his
proposition
todhunter
jealousy
of
any
disturbing
force
in
the
influence
she
held
over
her
son
doria
knew
to
be
one
of
the
causes
of
john
remaining
constant
to
the
impression
she
had
produced
on
him
she
spoke
so
kindly
of
john
and
laid
so
much
stress
on
the
ingrained
obedience
and
passive
disposition
of
her
daughter
that
todhunter
was
led
to
admit
she
did
think
it
almost
time
john
should
be
seeking
a
mate
and
that
he
all
things
considered
would
hardly
find
a
fitter
one
and
this
john
todhunter
old
john
no
more
heard
to
his
amazement
when
a
day
or
two
subsequently
he
instanced
the
probable
disapproval
of
his
mother
the
match
was
arranged
doria
did
the
wooing
it
consisted
in
telling
clare
that
she
had
come
to
years
when
marriage
was
desirable
and
that
she
had
fallen
into
habits
of
moping
which
might
have
the
worse
effect
on
her
future
life
as
it
had
on
her
present
health
and
appearance
and
which
a
husband
would
cure
richard
was
told
by
doria
that
clare
had
instantaneously
consented
to
accept
john
todhunter
as
lord
of
her
days
and
with
more
than
obedience
with
alacrity
at
all
events
when
richard
spoke
to
clare
the
strange
passive
creature
did
not
admit
constraint
on
her
inclinations
doria
allowed
richard
to
speak
to
her
she
laughed
at
his
futile
endeavours
to
undo
her
work
and
the
boyish
sentiments
he
uttered
on
the
subject
let
us
see
child
she
said
let
us
see
which
turns
out
the
best
a
marriage
of
passion
or
a
marriage
of
common
sense
heroic
efforts
were
not
wanting
to
arrest
the
union
richard
made
repeated
journeys
to
hounslow
where
ralph
was
quartered
and
if
ralph
could
have
been
persuaded
to
carry
off
a
young
lady
who
did
not
love
him
from
the
bridegroom
her
mother
averred
she
did
love
doria
might
have
been
defeated
but
ralph
in
his
cavalry
quarters
was
cooler
than
ralph
in
the
bursley
meadows
women
are
oddities
dick
he
remarked
running
a
finger
right
and
left
along
his
upper
lip
best
leave
them
to
their
own
freaks
she
a
dear
girl
though
she
does
talk
i
like
her
for
that
if
she
cared
for
me
i
go
the
race
she
never
did
it
no
use
asking
a
girl
twice
she
knows
whether
she
cares
a
fig
for
a
fellow
the
hero
quitted
him
with
some
contempt
as
ralph
morton
was
a
young
man
and
he
had
determined
that
john
todhunter
was
an
old
man
he
sought
another
private
interview
with
clare
and
getting
her
alone
said
clare
i
come
to
you
for
the
last
time
will
you
marry
ralph
morton
to
which
clare
replied
i
can
not
marry
two
husbands
richard
will
you
refuse
to
marry
this
old
man
i
must
do
as
mama
wishes
then
you
going
to
marry
an
old
man
a
man
you
do
love
and
love
oh
good
god
do
you
know
what
you
doing
he
flung
about
in
a
fury
do
you
know
what
it
is
clare
he
caught
her
two
hands
violently
have
you
any
idea
of
the
horror
you
going
to
commit
she
shrank
a
little
at
his
vehemence
but
neither
blushed
nor
stammered
answering
i
see
nothing
wrong
in
doing
what
mama
thinks
right
richard
your
mother
i
tell
you
it
an
infamy
clare
it
a
miserable
sin
i
tell
you
if
i
had
done
such
a
thing
i
would
not
live
an
hour
after
it
and
coldly
to
prepare
for
it
to
be
busy
about
your
dresses
they
told
me
when
i
came
in
that
you
were
with
the
milliner
to
be
smiling
over
the
horrible
outrage
decorating
yourself
dear
richard
said
clare
you
will
make
me
very
unhappy
that
one
of
my
blood
should
be
so
debased
he
cried
brushing
angrily
at
his
face
unhappy
i
beg
you
to
feel
for
yourself
clare
but
i
suppose
and
he
said
it
scornfully
girls
do
feel
this
sort
of
shame
she
grew
a
trifle
paler
next
to
mama
i
would
wish
to
please
you
dear
richard
have
you
no
will
of
your
own
he
exclaimed
she
looked
at
him
softly
a
look
he
interpreted
for
the
meekness
he
detested
in
her
no
i
believe
you
have
none
he
added
and
what
can
i
do
i
step
forward
and
stop
this
accursed
marriage
if
you
would
but
say
a
word
i
would
save
you
but
you
tie
my
hands
and
they
expect
me
to
stand
by
and
see
it
done
will
you
not
be
there
richard
said
clare
following
the
question
with
her
soft
eyes
it
was
the
same
voice
that
had
so
thrilled
him
on
his
marriage
morn
oh
my
darling
clare
he
cried
in
the
kindest
way
he
had
ever
used
to
her
if
you
knew
how
i
feel
this
and
now
as
he
wept
she
wept
and
came
insensibly
into
his
arms
my
darling
clare
he
repeated
she
said
nothing
but
seemed
to
shudder
weeping
you
will
do
it
clare
you
will
be
sacrificed
so
lovely
as
you
are
too
clare
you
can
not
be
quite
blind
if
i
dared
speak
to
you
and
tell
you
all
look
up
can
you
still
consent
i
must
not
disobey
mama
clare
murmured
without
looking
up
from
the
nest
her
cheek
had
made
on
his
bosom
then
kiss
me
for
the
last
time
said
richard
i
never
kiss
you
after
it
clare
he
bent
his
head
to
meet
her
mouth
and
she
threw
her
arms
wildly
round
him
and
kissed
him
convulsively
and
clung
to
his
lips
shutting
her
eyes
her
face
suffused
with
a
burning
red
then
he
left
her
unaware
of
the
meaning
of
those
passionate
kisses
argument
with
doria
was
like
firing
against
a
stone
wall
to
her
indeed
the
young
married
hero
spoke
almost
indecorously
and
that
which
his
delicacy
withheld
him
from
speaking
to
clare
he
could
provoke
nothing
more
responsive
from
the
practical
animal
than
tush
tush
and
fiddlededee
really
doria
said
to
her
intimates
that
boy
education
acts
like
a
disease
on
him
he
can
not
regard
anything
sensibly
he
is
for
ever
in
some
mad
excess
of
his
fancy
and
what
he
will
come
to
at
last
heaven
only
knows
i
sincerely
pray
that
austin
will
be
able
to
bear
it
threats
of
prayer
however
that
harp
upon
their
sincerity
are
not
very
well
worth
having
doria
had
embarked
in
a
practical
controversy
as
it
were
with
her
brother
doubtless
she
did
trust
he
would
be
able
to
bear
his
sorrows
to
come
but
one
who
has
uttered
prophecy
can
barely
help
hoping
to
see
it
fulfilled
she
had
prophecied
much
grief
to
the
baronet
poor
john
todhunter
who
would
rather
have
married
the
mother
and
had
none
of
your
heroic
notions
about
the
sacred
necessity
for
love
in
marriage
moved
as
one
guiltless
of
offence
and
deserving
his
happiness
doria
shielded
him
from
the
hero
to
see
him
smile
at
obedient
figure
and
try
not
to
look
paternal
was
touching
meantime
clare
marriage
served
one
purpose
it
completely
occupied
richard
mind
and
prevented
him
from
chafing
at
the
vexation
of
not
finding
his
father
ready
to
meet
him
when
he
came
to
town
a
letter
had
awaited
adrian
at
the
hotel
which
said
detain
him
till
you
hear
further
from
me
take
him
about
with
you
into
every
form
of
society
no
more
than
that
adrian
had
to
extemporize
that
the
baronet
had
gone
down
to
wales
on
pressing
business
and
would
be
back
in
a
week
or
so
for
ulterior
inventions
and
devices
wherewith
to
keep
the
young
gentleman
in
town
he
applied
to
doria
leave
him
to
me
said
doria
i
manage
him
and
she
did
who
can
say
asks
the
pilgrim
scrip
when
he
is
not
walking
a
puppet
to
some
woman
doria
would
hear
no
good
of
lucy
i
believe
she
observed
as
adrian
ventured
a
shrugging
protest
in
her
behalf
it
is
my
firm
opinion
that
a
would
turn
any
of
you
men
round
her
little
finger
only
give
her
time
and
opportunity
by
dwelling
on
the
arts
of
women
she
reconciled
it
to
her
conscience
to
do
her
best
to
divide
the
young
husband
from
his
wife
till
it
pleased
his
father
they
should
live
their
unhallowed
union
again
without
compunction
or
a
sense
of
incongruity
she
abused
her
brother
and
assisted
the
fulfilment
of
his
behests
so
the
puppets
were
marshalled
by
doria
happy
or
sad
or
indifferent
quite
against
his
set
resolve
and
the
tide
of
his
feelings
richard
found
himself
standing
behind
clare
in
the
church
the
very
edifice
that
had
witnessed
his
own
marriage
and
heard
i
clare
doria
take
thee
john
pemberton
clearly
pronounced
he
stood
with
black
brows
dissecting
the
arts
of
the
tailor
and
hairdresser
on
unconscious
john
the
back
and
much
of
the
middle
of
todhunter
head
was
bald
the
back
shone
like
an
but
across
the
middle
the
artist
had
drawn
two
long
dabs
of
hair
from
the
sides
and
plastered
them
cunningly
so
that
all
save
wilful
eyes
would
have
acknowledged
the
head
to
be
covered
the
man
only
pretension
was
to
a
respectable
juvenility
he
had
a
good
chest
stout
limbs
a
face
inclined
to
be
jolly
doria
had
no
cause
to
be
put
out
of
countenance
at
all
by
the
exterior
of
her
nor
was
she
her
splendid
hair
and
gratified
smile
made
a
light
in
the
church
playing
puppets
must
be
an
immense
pleasure
to
the
practical
animal
the
forey
bridesmaids
five
in
number
and
one
miss
doria
their
cousin
stood
as
girls
do
stand
at
these
sacrifices
whether
happy
sad
or
indifferent
a
smile
on
their
lips
and
tears
in
attendance
old
todhunter
an
exceedingly
small
ancient
woman
was
also
there
i
have
my
boy
john
married
without
seeing
it
done
she
said
and
throughout
the
ceremony
she
was
muttering
audible
encomiums
on
her
manly
behaviour
the
ring
was
affixed
to
clare
finger
there
was
no
ring
lost
in
this
marriage
the
instant
the
clergyman
bade
him
employ
it
john
drew
the
ring
out
and
dropped
it
on
the
finger
of
the
cold
passive
hand
in
a
businesslike
way
as
one
who
had
studied
the
matter
doria
glanced
aside
at
richard
richard
observed
clare
spread
out
her
fingers
that
the
operation
might
be
the
more
easily
effected
he
did
duty
in
the
vestry
a
few
minutes
and
then
said
to
his
aunt
now
i
go
you
come
to
the
breakfast
child
the
foreys
he
cut
her
short
i
stood
for
the
family
and
i
do
no
more
i
wo
pretend
to
eat
and
make
merry
over
it
richard
she
had
attained
her
object
and
she
wisely
gave
way
well
go
and
kiss
clare
and
shake
his
hand
pray
pray
be
civil
she
turned
to
adrian
and
said
he
is
going
you
must
go
with
him
and
find
some
means
of
keeping
him
or
he
be
running
off
to
that
woman
now
no
words
go
richard
bade
clare
farewell
she
put
up
her
mouth
to
him
humbly
but
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
do
not
cease
to
love
me
she
said
in
a
quavering
whisper
in
his
ear
todhunter
stood
beaming
and
endangering
the
art
of
the
hairdresser
with
his
now
he
positively
was
married
he
thought
he
would
rather
have
the
daughter
than
the
mother
which
is
a
reverse
of
the
order
of
human
thankfulness
at
a
gift
of
the
gods
richard
my
boy
he
said
heartily
congratulate
me
i
should
be
happy
to
if
i
could
sedately
replied
the
hero
to
the
consternation
of
those
around
nodding
to
the
bridesmaids
and
bowing
to
the
old
lady
he
passed
out
adrian
who
had
been
behind
him
deputed
to
watch
for
a
possible
unpleasantness
just
hinted
to
john
you
know
poor
fellow
he
has
got
into
a
mess
with
his
marriage
oh
ah
yes
kindly
said
john
poor
fellow
all
the
puppets
then
rolled
off
to
the
breakfast
adrian
hurried
after
richard
in
an
extremely
discontented
state
of
mind
not
to
be
at
the
breakfast
and
see
the
best
of
the
fun
disgusted
him
however
he
remembered
that
he
was
a
philosopher
and
the
strong
disgust
he
felt
was
only
expressed
in
concentrated
cynicism
on
every
earthly
matter
engendered
by
the
conversation
they
walked
side
by
side
into
kensington
gardens
the
hero
was
mouthing
away
to
himself
talking
by
fits
presently
he
faced
adrian
crying
and
i
might
have
stopped
it
i
see
it
now
i
might
have
stopped
it
by
going
straight
to
him
and
asking
him
if
he
dared
marry
a
girl
who
did
not
love
him
and
i
never
thought
of
it
good
heaven
i
feel
this
miserable
affair
on
my
conscience
ah
groaned
adrian
an
unpleasant
cargo
for
the
conscience
that
i
would
rather
carry
anything
on
mine
than
a
married
couple
do
you
purpose
going
to
him
now
the
hero
soliloquized
he
not
a
bad
sort
of
well
he
not
a
cavalier
said
adrian
and
that
why
you
wonder
your
aunt
selected
him
no
doubt
he
decidedly
of
the
roundhead
type
with
the
puritan
extracted
or
inoffensive
if
latent
there
the
double
infamy
cried
richard
that
a
man
you
ca
call
bad
should
do
this
damned
thing
well
it
hard
we
ca
find
a
villain
he
would
have
listened
to
me
i
sure
go
to
him
now
richard
my
son
go
to
him
now
it
not
yet
too
late
who
knows
if
he
really
has
a
noble
elevated
superior
mind
though
not
a
cavalier
in
person
he
may
be
one
at
heart
he
might
to
please
you
and
since
you
put
such
stress
upon
it
abstain
perhaps
with
some
loss
of
dignity
but
never
mind
and
the
request
might
be
singular
or
seem
so
but
everything
has
happened
before
in
this
world
you
know
my
dear
boy
and
what
an
infinite
consolation
it
is
for
the
eccentric
that
reflection
the
hero
was
impervious
to
the
wise
youth
he
stared
at
him
as
if
he
were
but
a
speck
in
the
universe
he
visioned
it
was
provoking
that
richard
should
be
adrian
best
subject
for
cynical
pastime
in
the
extraordinary
heterodoxies
he
started
and
his
worst
in
the
way
he
took
it
and
the
wise
youth
against
his
will
had
to
feel
as
conscious
of
the
young
man
imaginative
mental
armour
as
he
was
of
his
muscular
physical
the
same
sort
of
day
mused
richard
looking
up
i
suppose
my
father
right
we
make
our
own
fates
and
nature
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
adrian
yawned
some
difference
in
the
trees
though
richard
continued
abstractedly
growing
bald
at
the
top
said
adrian
will
you
believe
that
my
aunt
helen
compared
the
conduct
of
that
wretched
slave
clare
to
lucy
who
she
had
the
cruel
insolence
to
say
entangled
me
into
marriage
the
hero
broke
out
loudly
and
rapidly
you
know
i
told
you
adrian
how
i
had
to
threaten
and
insist
and
how
she
pleaded
and
implored
me
to
wait
ah
hum
mumbled
adrian
you
remember
my
telling
you
richard
was
earnest
to
hear
her
exonerated
pleaded
and
implored
my
dear
boy
oh
no
doubt
she
did
where
the
lass
that
does
call
my
wife
by
another
name
if
you
please
the
generic
title
ca
be
cancelled
because
of
your
having
married
one
of
the
body
my
son
she
did
all
she
could
to
persuade
me
to
wait
emphasized
richard
adrian
shook
his
head
with
a
deplorable
smile
come
come
my
good
ricky
not
all
not
all
richard
bellowed
what
more
could
she
have
done
she
could
have
shaved
her
head
for
instance
this
happy
shaft
did
stick
with
a
furious
exclamation
richard
shot
in
front
adrian
following
him
and
asking
him
merely
to
have
his
assumption
verified
whether
he
did
not
think
she
might
have
shaved
her
head
and
presuming
her
to
have
done
so
whether
in
candour
he
did
not
think
he
would
have
waited
at
least
till
she
looked
less
of
a
rank
lunatic
after
a
minute
or
so
the
wise
youth
was
but
a
fly
buzzing
about
richard
head
three
weeks
of
separation
from
lucy
and
an
excitement
deceased
caused
him
to
have
soft
yearnings
for
the
dear
lovely
face
he
told
adrian
it
was
his
intention
to
go
down
that
night
adrian
immediately
became
serious
he
was
at
a
loss
what
to
invent
to
detain
him
beyond
the
stale
fiction
that
his
father
was
coming
he
rendered
homage
to
the
genius
of
woman
in
these
straits
my
aunt
he
thought
would
have
the
lie
ready
and
not
only
that
but
she
would
take
care
it
did
its
work
at
this
juncture
the
voice
of
a
cavalier
in
the
row
hailed
them
proving
to
be
the
honourable
peter
brayder
lord
mountfalcon
parasite
he
greeted
them
very
cordially
and
richard
remembering
some
fun
they
had
in
the
island
asked
him
to
dine
with
them
postponing
his
return
till
the
next
day
lucy
was
his
it
was
even
sweet
to
dally
with
the
delight
of
seeing
her
the
hon
peter
was
one
who
did
honour
to
the
body
he
belonged
to
though
not
so
tall
as
a
west
of
london
footman
he
was
as
shapely
and
he
had
a
power
of
making
his
voice
insinuating
or
arrogant
as
it
suited
the
exigencies
of
his
profession
he
had
not
a
rap
of
money
in
the
world
yet
he
rode
a
horse
lived
high
expended
largely
the
world
said
that
the
hon
peter
was
salaried
by
his
lordship
and
that
in
common
with
that
of
parasite
he
exercised
the
ancient
companion
profession
this
the
world
said
and
still
smiled
at
the
hon
peter
for
he
was
an
engaging
fellow
and
where
he
went
not
lord
mountfalcon
would
not
go
they
had
a
quiet
little
hotel
dinner
ordered
by
adrian
and
made
a
square
at
the
table
ripton
thompson
being
the
fourth
richard
sent
down
to
his
office
to
fetch
him
and
the
two
friends
shook
hands
for
the
first
time
since
the
great
deed
had
been
executed
deep
was
the
old
delight
to
hear
the
praises
of
his
beauty
sounded
by
such
aristocratic
lips
as
the
hon
peter
brayder
all
through
the
dinner
he
was
throwing
out
hints
and
small
queries
to
get
a
fuller
account
of
her
and
when
the
claret
had
circulated
he
spoke
a
word
or
two
himself
and
heard
the
hon
peter
eulogize
his
taste
and
wish
him
a
bride
as
beautiful
at
which
ripton
blushed
and
said
he
had
no
hope
of
that
and
the
hon
peter
assured
him
marriage
did
not
break
the
mould
after
the
wine
this
gentleman
took
his
cigar
on
the
balcony
and
found
occasion
to
get
some
conversation
with
adrian
alone
our
young
friend
here
made
it
all
right
with
the
governor
he
asked
carelessly
oh
yes
said
adrian
but
it
struck
him
that
brayder
might
be
of
assistance
in
showing
richard
a
little
of
the
in
every
required
by
his
chief
prescript
that
is
he
continued
we
are
not
yet
permitted
an
interview
with
the
august
author
of
our
being
and
i
have
rather
a
difficult
post
is
mine
both
to
keep
him
here
and
also
to
find
him
the
opportunity
to
measure
himself
with
his
in
other
words
his
father
wants
him
to
see
something
of
life
before
he
enters
upon
housekeeping
now
i
am
proud
to
confess
that
i
hardly
equal
to
the
task
the
demi
or
damnedmonde
if
it
that
lie
wants
him
to
observe
is
one
that
i
leave
not
got
the
walk
to
ha
ha
laughed
brayder
you
do
the
keeping
i
offer
to
parade
the
demi
i
must
say
though
it
a
queer
notion
of
the
old
gentleman
it
the
continuation
of
a
philosophic
plan
said
adrian
brayder
followed
the
curvings
of
the
whiff
of
his
cigar
with
his
eyes
and
ejaculated
infernally
philosophic
has
lord
mountfalcon
left
the
island
adrian
inquired
mount
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
know
where
he
is
chasing
some
light
craft
i
suppose
that
poor
mount
weakness
it
his
ruin
poor
fellow
he
so
confoundedly
in
earnest
at
the
game
he
ought
to
know
it
by
this
time
if
fame
speaks
true
remarked
adrian
he
a
baby
about
women
and
always
will
be
said
brayder
he
been
once
or
twice
wanting
to
marry
them
now
there
a
woman
you
heard
of
mount
all
the
world
knows
if
that
woman
scandalized
the
young
man
joined
them
and
checked
the
communication
brayder
winked
to
adrian
and
pitifully
indicated
the
presence
of
an
innocent
a
married
man
you
know
said
adrian
yes
yes
we
wo
shock
him
brayder
observed
he
appeared
to
study
the
young
man
while
they
talked
next
morning
richard
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
his
aunt
doria
took
a
seat
by
his
side
and
spoke
as
follows
my
dear
nephew
now
you
know
i
have
always
loved
you
and
thought
of
your
welfare
as
if
you
had
been
my
own
child
more
than
that
i
fear
well
now
you
are
thinking
of
returning
to
to
that
place
are
you
not
yes
it
is
as
i
thought
very
well
now
let
me
speak
to
you
you
are
in
a
much
more
dangerous
position
than
you
imagine
i
do
deny
your
father
affection
for
you
it
would
be
absurd
to
deny
it
but
you
are
of
an
age
now
to
appreciate
his
character
whatever
you
may
do
he
will
always
give
you
money
that
you
are
sure
of
that
you
know
very
well
but
you
are
one
to
want
more
than
money
you
want
his
love
richard
i
am
convinced
you
will
never
be
happy
whatever
base
pleasures
you
may
be
led
into
if
he
should
withhold
his
love
from
you
now
child
you
know
you
have
grievously
offended
him
i
wish
not
to
animadvert
on
your
you
fancied
yourself
in
love
and
so
on
and
you
were
rash
the
less
said
of
it
the
better
now
but
you
must
now
it
is
your
duty
now
to
do
something
to
do
everything
that
lies
in
your
power
to
show
him
you
repent
no
interruptions
listen
to
me
you
must
consider
him
austin
is
not
like
other
men
austin
requires
the
most
delicate
management
you
must
whether
you
feel
it
or
no
present
an
appearance
of
contrition
i
counsel
it
for
the
good
of
all
he
is
just
like
a
woman
and
where
his
feelings
are
offended
he
wants
utter
subservience
he
has
you
in
town
and
he
does
not
see
you
now
you
know
that
he
and
i
are
not
in
communication
we
have
likewise
our
differences
well
he
has
you
in
town
and
he
holds
aloof
he
is
trying
you
my
dear
richard
no
he
is
not
at
raynham
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
he
is
trying
you
child
and
you
must
be
patient
you
must
convince
him
that
you
do
not
care
utterly
for
your
own
gratification
if
this
person
i
wish
to
speak
of
her
with
respect
for
your
sake
well
if
she
loves
you
at
all
if
i
say
she
loves
you
one
atom
she
will
repeat
my
solicitations
for
you
to
stay
and
patiently
wait
here
till
he
consents
to
see
you
i
tell
you
candidly
it
your
only
chance
of
ever
getting
him
to
receive
her
that
you
should
know
and
now
richard
i
may
add
that
there
is
something
else
you
should
know
you
should
know
that
it
depends
entirely
upon
your
conduct
now
whether
you
are
to
see
your
father
heart
for
ever
divided
from
you
and
a
new
family
at
raynham
you
do
not
understand
i
will
explain
brothers
and
sisters
are
excellent
things
for
young
people
but
a
new
brood
of
them
can
hardly
be
acceptable
to
a
young
man
in
fact
they
are
and
must
be
aliens
i
only
tell
you
what
i
have
heard
on
good
authority
do
you
understand
now
foolish
boy
if
you
do
not
humour
him
he
will
marry
her
oh
i
am
sure
of
it
i
know
it
and
this
you
will
drive
him
to
i
do
not
warn
you
on
the
score
of
your
prospects
but
of
your
feelings
i
should
regard
such
a
contingency
richard
as
a
final
division
between
you
think
of
the
scandal
but
alas
that
is
the
least
of
the
evils
it
was
doria
object
to
produce
an
impression
and
avoid
an
argument
she
therefore
left
him
as
soon
as
she
had
as
she
supposed
made
her
mark
on
the
young
man
richard
was
very
silent
during
the
speech
and
save
for
an
exclamation
or
so
had
listened
attentively
he
pondered
on
what
his
aunt
said
he
loved
lady
blandish
and
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
see
her
lady
feverel
doria
laid
painful
stress
on
the
scandal
and
though
he
did
not
give
his
mind
to
this
he
thought
of
it
he
thought
of
his
mother
where
was
she
but
most
his
thoughts
recurred
to
his
father
and
something
akin
to
jealousy
slowly
awakened
his
heart
to
him
he
had
given
him
up
and
had
not
latterly
felt
extremely
filial
but
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
a
division
in
the
love
of
which
he
had
ever
been
the
idol
and
sole
object
and
such
a
man
too
so
good
so
generous
if
it
was
jealousy
that
roused
the
young
man
heart
to
his
father
the
better
part
of
love
was
also
revived
in
it
he
thought
of
old
days
of
his
father
forbearance
his
own
wilfulness
he
looked
on
himself
and
what
he
had
done
with
the
eyes
of
such
a
man
he
determined
to
do
all
he
could
to
regain
his
favour
doria
learnt
from
adrian
in
the
evening
that
her
nephew
intended
waiting
in
town
another
week
that
will
do
smiled
doria
he
will
be
more
patient
at
the
end
of
a
week
oh
does
patience
beget
patience
said
adrian
i
was
not
aware
it
was
a
propagating
virtue
i
surrender
him
to
you
i
sha
be
able
to
hold
him
in
after
one
week
more
i
assure
you
my
dear
aunt
he
already
thank
you
no
explanation
doria
begged
when
richard
saw
her
nest
he
was
informed
that
she
had
received
a
most
satisfactory
letter
from
john
todhunter
quite
a
glowing
account
of
john
behaviour
but
on
richard
desiring
to
know
the
words
clare
had
written
doria
objected
to
be
explicit
and
shot
into
worldly
gossip
clare
seldom
glows
said
richard
no
i
mean
for
her
his
aunt
remarked
do
look
like
your
father
child
i
should
like
to
have
seen
the
letter
said
richard
doria
did
not
propose
to
show
it
chapter
xxxvi
a
lady
driving
a
pair
of
greys
was
noticed
by
richard
in
his
rides
and
walks
she
passed
him
rather
obviously
and
often
she
was
very
handsome
a
bold
beauty
with
shining
black
hair
red
lips
and
eyes
not
afraid
of
men
the
hair
was
brushed
from
her
temples
leaving
one
of
those
fine
reckless
outlines
which
the
action
of
driving
and
the
pace
admirably
set
off
she
took
his
fancy
he
liked
the
air
of
petulant
gallantry
about
her
and
mused
upon
the
picture
rare
to
him
of
a
glorious
dashing
woman
he
thought
too
she
looked
at
him
he
was
not
at
the
time
inclined
to
be
vain
or
he
might
have
been
sure
she
did
once
it
struck
him
she
nodded
slightly
he
asked
adrian
one
day
in
the
park
who
she
was
i
do
know
her
said
adrian
probably
a
superior
priestess
of
paphos
now
that
my
idea
of
bellona
richard
exclaimed
not
the
fury
they
paint
but
a
spirited
dauntless
creature
like
that
bellona
returned
the
wise
youth
i
do
think
her
hair
was
black
red
was
it
i
should
compare
her
to
bellona
though
no
doubt
she
as
ready
to
spill
blood
look
at
her
she
does
seem
to
scent
carnage
i
see
your
idea
no
i
should
liken
her
to
diana
emerged
from
the
tutorship
of
master
endymion
and
at
nice
play
among
the
gods
depend
upon
it
they
tell
us
nothing
of
the
matter
olympus
shrouds
the
story
but
you
may
be
certain
that
when
she
left
the
pretty
shepherd
she
had
greater
vogue
than
venus
up
aloft
brayder
joined
them
see
mount
go
by
he
said
oh
that
mrs
mount
cried
adrian
who
mrs
mount
richard
inquired
a
sister
to
miss
random
my
dear
boy
like
to
know
her
drawled
the
hon
peter
richard
replied
indifferently
no
and
mount
passed
out
of
sight
and
out
of
the
conversation
the
young
man
wrote
submissive
letters
to
his
father
i
have
remained
here
waiting
to
see
you
now
five
weeks
he
wrote
i
have
written
to
you
three
letters
and
you
do
not
reply
to
them
let
me
tell
you
again
how
sincerely
i
desire
and
pray
that
you
will
come
or
permit
me
to
come
to
you
and
throw
myself
at
your
feet
and
beg
my
forgiveness
and
hers
she
as
earnestly
implores
it
indeed
i
am
very
wretched
sir
believe
me
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
regain
your
esteem
and
the
love
i
fear
i
have
unhappily
forfeited
i
will
remain
another
week
in
the
hope
of
hearing
from
you
or
seeing
you
i
beg
of
you
sir
not
to
drive
me
mad
whatever
you
ask
of
me
i
will
consent
to
nothing
he
would
not
do
the
baronet
commented
as
he
read
there
is
nothing
he
would
not
do
he
will
remain
another
week
and
give
me
that
final
chance
and
it
is
i
who
drive
him
mad
already
he
is
beginning
to
cast
his
retribution
on
my
shoulders
sir
austin
had
really
gone
down
to
wales
to
be
out
of
the
way
a
does
not
meet
misfortune
without
hearing
of
it
and
the
author
of
the
pilgrim
scrip
in
trouble
found
london
too
hot
for
him
he
quitted
london
to
take
refuge
among
the
mountains
living
there
in
solitary
commune
with
a
virgin
some
indefinite
scheme
was
in
his
head
in
this
treatment
of
his
son
had
he
construed
it
it
would
have
looked
ugly
and
it
settled
to
a
vague
principle
that
the
young
man
should
be
tried
and
tested
let
him
learn
to
deny
himself
something
let
him
live
with
his
equals
for
a
term
if
he
loves
me
he
will
read
my
wishes
thus
he
explained
his
principle
to
lady
blandish
the
lady
wrote
you
speak
of
a
term
till
when
may
i
name
one
to
him
it
is
the
dreadful
uncertainty
that
reduces
him
to
despair
that
and
nothing
else
pray
be
explicit
in
return
he
distantly
indicated
richard
majority
how
could
lady
blandish
go
and
ask
the
young
man
to
wait
a
year
away
from
his
wife
her
instinct
began
to
open
a
wide
eye
on
the
idol
she
worshipped
when
people
do
not
themselves
know
what
they
mean
they
succeed
in
deceiving
and
imposing
upon
others
not
only
was
lady
blandish
mystified
doria
who
pierced
into
the
recesses
of
everybody
mind
and
had
always
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
off
her
brother
from
infancy
and
had
never
known
herself
to
be
once
wrong
about
him
she
confessed
she
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
austin
principle
for
principle
he
has
said
doria
he
never
acts
without
one
but
what
it
is
i
can
not
at
present
perceive
if
he
would
write
and
command
the
boy
to
await
his
return
all
would
be
clear
he
allows
us
to
go
and
fetch
him
and
then
leaves
us
all
in
a
quandary
it
must
be
some
woman
influence
that
is
the
only
way
to
account
for
it
singular
interjected
adrian
what
pride
women
have
in
their
sex
well
i
have
to
tell
you
my
dear
aunt
that
the
day
after
i
hand
my
charge
over
to
your
keeping
i
ca
hold
him
in
an
hour
longer
i
had
to
leash
him
with
lies
till
my
invention
exhausted
i
petition
to
have
them
put
down
to
the
chief
account
but
when
the
stream
runs
dry
i
can
do
no
more
the
last
was
that
i
had
heard
from
him
desiring
me
to
have
the
bedroom
ready
for
him
on
tuesday
proximate
says
my
son
wait
till
then
and
from
the
gigantic
effort
he
exhibited
in
coming
to
it
i
doubt
any
human
getting
him
to
wait
longer
we
must
we
must
detain
him
said
doria
if
we
do
not
i
am
convinced
austin
will
do
something
rash
that
he
will
for
ever
repent
he
will
marry
that
woman
adrian
mark
my
words
now
with
any
other
young
man
but
richard
education
that
ridiculous
system
has
he
no
distraction
nothing
to
amuse
him
poor
boy
i
suppose
he
wants
his
own
particular
playfellow
the
wise
youth
had
to
bow
to
a
reproof
i
tell
you
adrian
he
will
marry
that
woman
my
dear
aunt
can
a
chaste
man
do
aught
more
commendable
has
the
boy
no
object
we
can
induce
him
to
follow
if
he
had
but
a
profession
what
say
you
to
the
regeneration
of
the
streets
of
london
and
the
profession
of
aunt
i
assure
you
i
have
served
a
month
apprenticeship
with
him
we
sally
forth
on
the
tenth
hour
of
the
night
a
female
passes
i
hear
him
groan
she
one
of
them
adrian
i
am
compelled
to
admit
she
is
not
the
saint
he
deems
it
the
portion
of
every
creature
wearing
petticoats
to
be
another
groan
an
evident
internal
can
not
be
and
yet
that
we
hear
on
the
stage
rollings
of
eyes
impious
questionings
of
the
creator
of
the
universe
savage
mutterings
against
brutal
males
and
then
we
meet
a
second
young
person
and
repeat
the
performance
of
which
i
am
rather
tired
it
would
be
all
very
well
but
he
turns
upon
me
and
lectures
me
because
i
hire
a
house
and
furnish
it
for
all
the
women
one
meets
to
live
in
in
purity
now
that
too
much
to
ask
of
a
quiet
man
master
thompson
has
latterly
relieved
me
i
happy
to
say
doria
thought
her
thoughts
has
austin
written
to
you
since
you
were
in
town
not
an
aphorism
returned
adrian
i
must
see
richard
morning
doria
ended
the
colloquy
by
saying
the
result
of
her
interview
with
her
nephew
was
that
richard
made
no
allusion
to
a
departure
on
the
tuesday
and
for
many
days
afterward
he
appeared
to
have
an
absorbing
business
on
his
hands
but
what
it
was
adrian
did
not
then
learn
and
his
admiration
of
doria
genius
for
management
rose
to
a
very
high
pitch
on
a
morning
in
october
they
had
an
early
visitor
in
the
person
of
the
hon
peter
whom
they
had
not
seen
for
a
week
or
more
gentlemen
he
said
flourishing
his
cane
in
his
most
affable
manner
i
come
to
propose
to
you
to
join
us
in
a
little
at
richmond
nobody
in
town
you
know
london
as
dead
as
a
nothing
but
the
scrapings
to
offer
you
but
the
weather
fine
i
flatter
myself
you
find
the
company
agreeable
what
says
my
friend
feverel
richard
begged
to
be
excused
no
no
positively
you
must
come
said
the
hon
peter
i
had
some
trouble
to
get
them
together
to
relieve
the
dulness
of
your
incarceration
richmond
within
the
rules
of
your
prison
you
can
be
back
by
night
moonlight
on
the
water
lovely
woman
we
engaged
a
to
pull
us
back
eight
oars
i
not
sure
it
is
sixteen
come
the
word
adrian
was
for
going
richard
said
he
had
an
appointment
with
ripton
you
in
for
another
rick
you
two
said
adrian
arrange
that
we
go
you
have
seen
the
cockney
paradise
abjure
blazes
and
taste
of
peace
my
son
after
some
persuasion
richard
yawned
wearily
and
got
up
and
threw
aside
the
care
that
was
on
him
saying
very
well
just
as
you
like
we
take
old
rip
with
us
adrian
consulted
brayder
eye
at
this
the
hon
peter
briskly
declared
he
should
be
delighted
to
have
feverel
friend
and
offered
to
take
them
all
down
in
his
drag
if
you
do
get
a
match
on
to
swim
there
with
the
tide
eh
feverel
my
boy
richard
replied
that
he
had
given
up
that
sort
of
thing
at
which
brayder
communicated
a
queer
glance
to
adrian
and
applauded
the
youth
richmond
was
under
a
still
october
sun
the
pleasant
landscape
bathed
in
autumn
stretched
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
to
a
red
horizon
haze
the
day
was
like
none
that
richard
vividly
remembered
it
touched
no
link
in
the
chain
of
his
recollection
it
was
quiet
and
belonged
to
the
spirit
of
the
season
adrian
had
divined
the
character
of
the
scrapings
they
were
to
meet
brayder
introduced
them
to
one
or
two
of
the
men
hastily
and
in
rather
an
undervoice
as
a
thing
to
get
over
they
made
their
bow
to
the
first
knot
of
ladies
they
encountered
propriety
was
observed
strictly
even
to
severity
the
general
talk
was
of
the
weather
here
and
there
a
lady
would
seize
a
or
any
little
bit
of
the
habiliments
of
the
man
she
was
addressing
and
if
it
came
to
her
to
chide
him
she
did
it
with
more
than
a
forefinger
this
however
was
only
here
and
there
and
a
privilege
of
intimacy
where
ladies
are
gathered
together
the
queen
of
the
assemblage
may
be
known
by
her
court
of
males
the
queen
of
the
present
gathering
leaned
against
a
corner
of
the
open
window
surrounded
by
a
stalwart
court
in
whom
a
practised
eye
would
have
discerned
guardsmen
and
ripton
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
apprehended
lords
they
were
fine
men
offering
inanimate
homage
the
trim
of
their
whiskerage
the
cut
of
their
coats
the
indolence
in
their
aspect
eclipsed
ripton
sense
of
esteem
but
they
kindly
looked
over
him
occasionally
one
committed
a
momentary
outrage
on
him
with
an
seeming
to
cry
out
in
a
voice
of
scathing
scorn
who
this
and
ripton
got
closer
to
his
hero
to
justify
his
humble
pretensions
to
existence
and
an
identity
in
the
shadow
of
him
richard
gazed
about
heroes
do
not
always
know
what
to
say
or
do
and
the
cold
bath
before
dinner
in
strange
company
is
one
of
the
instances
he
had
recognized
his
superb
bellona
in
the
lady
by
the
garden
window
for
brayder
the
men
had
nods
and
yokes
the
ladies
a
pretty
playfulness
he
was
very
busy
passing
between
the
groups
chatting
laughing
taking
the
feminine
taps
he
received
and
sometimes
returning
them
in
sly
whispers
adrian
sat
down
and
crossed
his
legs
looking
amused
and
benignant
whose
dinner
is
it
ripton
heard
a
mignonne
beauty
ask
of
a
cavalier
mount
i
suppose
was
the
answer
where
is
he
why
do
he
come
an
affaire
i
fancy
there
he
is
again
how
shamefully
he
treats
mrs
mount
she
do
seem
to
cry
over
it
mount
was
flashing
her
teeth
and
eyes
with
laughter
at
one
of
her
court
who
appeared
to
be
fool
dinner
was
announced
the
ladies
proclaimed
extravagant
appetites
brayder
posted
his
three
friends
ripton
found
himself
under
the
lee
of
a
dame
with
a
bosom
on
the
other
aide
of
him
was
the
mignonne
adrian
was
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
ladies
were
in
profusion
and
he
had
his
share
brayder
drew
richard
from
seat
to
seat
a
happy
man
had
established
himself
next
to
mount
him
brayder
hailed
to
take
the
head
of
the
table
the
happy
man
objected
brayder
continued
urgent
the
lady
tenderly
insisted
the
happy
man
grimaced
dropped
into
the
post
of
honour
strove
to
look
placable
richard
usurped
his
chair
and
was
not
badly
welcomed
by
his
neighbour
then
the
dinner
commenced
and
had
all
the
attention
of
the
company
till
the
flying
of
the
first
gave
the
signal
and
a
hum
began
to
spread
sparkling
wine
that
looseneth
the
tongue
and
displayeth
the
verity
hath
also
the
quality
of
colouring
it
the
ladies
laughed
high
richard
only
thought
them
gay
and
natural
they
flung
back
in
their
chairs
and
laughed
to
tears
ripton
thought
only
of
the
pleasure
he
had
in
their
society
the
continued
a
regular
where
have
you
been
lately
i
have
seen
you
in
the
park
said
mount
to
richard
no
he
replied
i
not
been
there
the
question
seemed
odd
she
spoke
so
simply
that
it
did
not
impress
him
he
emptied
his
glass
and
had
it
filled
again
the
hon
peter
did
most
of
the
open
talking
which
related
to
horses
yachting
opera
and
sport
generally
who
was
ruined
by
what
horse
or
by
what
woman
he
told
one
or
two
of
richard
feats
fair
smiles
rewarded
the
hero
do
you
bet
said
mount
only
on
myself
returned
richard
bravo
cried
his
bellona
and
her
eye
sent
a
lingering
delirious
sparkle
across
her
brimming
glass
at
him
i
sure
you
a
safe
one
to
back
she
added
and
seemed
to
scan
his
points
approvingly
richard
cheeks
mounted
bloom
do
you
adore
champagne
quoth
the
dame
with
a
bosom
to
ripton
oh
yes
answered
ripton
with
more
candour
than
accuracy
i
always
drink
it
do
you
indeed
said
the
enraptured
bosom
ogling
him
you
would
be
a
friend
now
i
hope
you
do
object
to
a
lady
joining
you
now
and
then
champagne
my
folly
a
laugh
was
circling
among
the
ladies
of
whom
adrian
was
the
centre
first
low
and
as
he
continued
some
narration
peals
resounded
till
those
excluded
from
the
fun
demanded
the
cue
and
ladies
leaned
behind
gentlemen
to
take
it
up
and
formed
an
electric
chain
of
laughter
each
one
as
her
ear
received
it
caught
up
her
handkerchief
and
laughed
and
looked
shocked
afterwards
or
looked
shocked
and
then
spouted
laughter
the
anecdote
might
have
been
communicated
to
the
bewildered
cavaliers
but
coming
to
a
lady
of
a
demurer
cast
she
looked
shocked
without
laughing
and
reproved
the
female
table
in
whose
breasts
it
was
consigned
to
burial
but
here
and
there
a
man
head
was
seen
bent
and
a
lady
mouth
moved
though
her
face
was
not
turned
toward
him
and
a
man
broad
laugh
was
presently
heard
while
the
lady
gazed
unconsciously
before
her
and
preserved
her
gravity
if
she
could
escape
any
other
lady
eyes
failing
in
which
handkerchiefs
were
simultaneously
seized
and
a
second
chime
arose
till
the
tickling
force
subsided
to
a
few
chance
bursts
what
nonsense
it
is
that
my
father
writes
about
women
thought
richard
he
says
they
ca
laugh
and
do
understand
humour
it
comes
he
reflected
of
his
shutting
himself
from
the
world
and
the
idea
that
he
was
seeing
the
world
and
feeling
wiser
flattered
him
he
talked
fluently
to
his
dangerous
bellona
he
gave
her
some
reminiscences
of
adrian
whimsies
oh
said
she
that
your
tutor
is
it
she
eyed
the
young
man
as
if
she
thought
he
must
go
far
and
fast
ripton
felt
a
push
look
at
that
said
the
bosom
fuming
utter
disgust
he
was
directed
to
see
a
manly
arm
round
the
waist
of
the
mignonne
now
that
what
i
do
like
in
company
the
bosom
inflated
to
observe
with
sufficient
emphasis
she
always
will
allow
it
with
everybody
give
her
a
nudge
ripton
protested
that
he
dared
not
upon
which
she
said
then
i
will
and
inclined
her
sumptuous
bust
across
his
lap
breathing
wine
in
his
face
and
gave
the
nudge
the
mignonne
turned
an
inquiring
eye
on
ripton
a
mischievous
spark
shot
from
it
she
laughed
and
said
you
satisfied
with
the
old
girl
impudence
muttered
the
bosom
growing
grander
and
redder
do
do
fill
her
glass
and
keep
her
quiet
she
drinks
port
when
no
more
champagne
said
the
mignonne
the
bosom
revenged
herself
by
whispering
to
ripton
scandal
of
the
mignonne
and
between
them
he
was
enabled
to
form
a
correcter
estimate
of
the
company
and
quite
recovered
from
his
original
awe
so
much
so
as
to
feel
a
touch
of
jealousy
at
seeing
his
lively
little
neighbour
still
held
in
absolute
possession
mount
did
not
come
out
much
but
there
was
a
deferential
manner
in
the
bearing
of
the
men
toward
her
which
those
haughty
creatures
accord
not
save
to
clever
women
and
she
contrived
to
hold
the
talk
with
three
or
four
at
the
head
of
the
table
while
she
still
had
passages
aside
with
richard
the
port
and
claret
went
very
well
after
the
champagne
the
ladies
here
did
not
ignominiously
surrender
the
field
to
the
gentlemen
they
maintained
their
position
with
honour
silver
was
seen
far
out
on
thames
the
wine
ebbed
and
the
laughter
sentiment
and
cigars
took
up
the
wondrous
tale
oh
what
a
lovely
night
said
the
ladies
looking
above
charming
said
the
gentlemen
looking
below
the
cool
autumn
air
was
pleasant
after
the
feast
fragrant
weeds
burned
bright
about
the
garden
we
are
split
into
couples
said
adrian
to
richard
who
was
standing
alone
eying
the
landscape
tis
the
influence
of
the
moon
apparently
we
are
in
cyprus
how
has
my
son
enjoyed
himself
how
likes
he
the
society
of
aspasia
i
feel
like
a
wise
greek
adrian
was
jolly
and
rolled
comfortably
as
he
talked
ripton
had
been
carried
off
by
the
sentimental
bosom
he
came
up
to
them
and
whispered
by
jove
ricky
do
you
know
what
sort
of
women
these
are
richard
said
he
thought
them
a
nice
sort
puritan
exclaimed
adrian
slapping
ripton
on
the
back
why
you
get
tipsy
sir
do
you
ever
intoxicate
yourself
except
at
lawful
marriages
reveal
to
us
what
you
have
done
with
the
portly
dame
ripton
endured
his
bantering
that
he
might
hang
about
richard
and
watch
over
him
he
was
jealous
of
his
innocent
beauty
husband
being
in
proximity
with
such
women
murmuring
couples
passed
them
to
and
fro
by
jove
ricky
ripton
favoured
his
friend
with
another
hard
whisper
there
a
woman
smoking
and
why
not
o
riptonus
said
adrian
art
unaware
that
woman
cosmopolitan
is
woman
consummate
and
dost
grumble
to
pay
the
small
price
for
the
splendid
gem
well
i
do
like
women
to
smoke
said
plain
ripton
why
may
they
do
what
men
do
the
hero
cried
impetuously
i
hate
that
contemptible
it
that
makes
the
ruin
and
horrors
i
see
why
may
they
do
what
men
do
i
like
the
women
who
are
brave
enough
not
to
be
hypocrites
by
heaven
if
these
women
are
bad
i
like
them
better
than
a
set
of
hypocritical
creatures
who
are
all
show
and
deceive
you
in
the
end
bravo
shouted
adrian
there
speaks
the
regenerator
ripton
as
usual
was
crushed
by
his
leader
he
had
no
argument
he
still
thought
women
ought
not
to
smoke
and
he
thought
of
one
far
away
lonely
by
the
sea
who
was
perfect
without
being
cosmopolitan
the
pilgrim
scrip
remarks
that
young
men
take
joy
in
nothing
so
much
as
the
thinking
women
angels
and
nothing
sours
men
of
experience
more
than
knowing
that
all
are
not
quite
so
the
aphorist
would
have
pardoned
ripton
thompson
his
first
random
extravagance
had
he
perceived
the
simple
worship
of
feminine
goodness
richard
young
bride
had
inspired
in
the
breast
of
the
youth
it
might
possibly
have
taught
him
to
put
deeper
trust
in
our
nature
ripton
thought
of
her
and
had
a
feeling
of
sadness
he
wandered
about
the
grounds
by
himself
went
through
an
open
postern
and
threw
himself
down
among
some
bushes
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
lying
there
and
meditating
he
became
aware
of
voices
conversing
what
does
he
want
said
a
woman
voice
it
another
of
his
villanies
i
know
upon
my
honour
brayder
when
i
think
of
what
i
have
to
reproach
him
for
i
think
i
must
go
mad
or
kill
him
tragic
said
the
hon
peter
have
you
revenged
yourself
bella
pretty
often
best
deal
openly
this
is
a
commercial
transaction
you
ask
for
money
and
you
are
to
have
it
on
the
conditions
double
the
sum
and
debts
paid
he
applies
to
me
you
know
my
dear
bella
it
has
long
been
all
up
between
you
i
think
mount
has
behaved
very
well
considering
all
he
knows
he
not
easily
hoodwinked
you
know
he
resigns
himself
to
his
fate
and
follows
other
game
then
the
condition
is
that
i
am
to
seduce
this
young
man
my
dear
bella
you
strike
your
bird
like
a
hawk
i
did
say
seduce
hold
him
in
play
with
him
amuse
him
i
do
understand
women
seldom
do
how
i
hate
you
brayder
i
thank
your
ladyship
the
two
walked
farther
ripton
had
heard
some
little
of
the
colloquy
he
left
the
spot
in
a
serious
mood
apprehensive
of
something
dark
to
the
people
he
loved
though
he
had
no
idea
of
what
the
hon
stipulation
involved
on
the
voyage
back
to
town
richard
was
again
selected
to
sit
by
mount
brayder
and
adrian
started
the
jokes
the
pair
of
parasites
got
on
extremely
well
together
soft
fell
the
plash
of
the
oars
softly
the
moonlight
curled
around
them
softly
the
banks
glided
by
the
ladies
were
in
a
state
of
high
sentiment
they
sang
without
request
all
deemed
the
british
an
appropriate
interpreter
of
their
emotions
after
good
wine
and
plenty
thereof
fair
throats
will
make
men
of
taste
swallow
that
remarkable
composer
eyes
lips
hearts
darts
and
smarts
and
sighs
beauty
duty
bosom
blossom
false
one
farewell
to
this
pathetic
strain
they
melted
mount
though
strongly
requested
declined
to
sing
she
preserved
her
state
under
the
tall
aspens
of
and
on
they
swept
the
white
moon
in
their
wake
richard
hand
lay
open
by
his
side
mount
little
white
hand
by
misadventure
fell
into
it
it
was
not
pressed
or
soothed
for
its
fall
or
made
intimate
with
eloquent
fingers
it
lay
there
like
a
bit
of
snow
on
the
cold
ground
a
yellow
leaf
wavering
down
from
the
aspens
struck
richard
cheek
and
he
drew
away
the
very
hand
to
throw
back
his
hair
and
smooth
his
face
and
then
folded
his
arms
unconscious
of
offence
he
was
thinking
ambitiously
of
his
life
his
blood
was
untroubled
his
brain
calmly
working
which
is
the
more
perilous
is
a
problem
put
by
the
pilgrim
to
meet
the
temptings
of
eve
or
to
pique
her
mount
stared
at
the
young
man
as
at
a
curiosity
and
turned
to
flirt
with
one
of
her
court
the
guardsmen
were
mostly
sentimental
one
or
two
rattled
and
one
was
such
a
fellow
that
adrian
could
not
make
him
ridiculous
the
others
seemed
to
give
themselves
up
to
a
silent
waxing
in
length
of
limb
however
far
they
sat
removed
everybody
was
entangled
in
their
legs
pursuing
his
studies
adrian
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
same
close
intellectual
and
moral
affinity
which
he
had
discovered
to
exist
between
our
nobility
and
our
yeomanry
is
to
be
observed
between
the
guardsman
class
and
that
of
the
corps
de
ballet
they
both
live
by
the
strength
of
their
legs
where
also
their
wits
if
they
do
not
altogether
reside
there
are
principally
developed
both
are
volage
wine
tobacco
and
the
moon
influence
both
alike
and
admitting
the
one
marked
difference
that
does
exist
it
is
after
all
pretty
nearly
the
same
thing
to
be
coquetting
and
sinning
on
two
legs
as
on
the
point
of
a
toe
a
long
guardsman
with
a
deep
bass
voice
sang
a
doleful
song
about
the
twining
tendrils
of
the
heart
ruthlessly
torn
but
required
urgent
persuasions
and
heavy
trumpeting
of
his
lungs
to
get
to
the
end
before
he
had
accomplished
it
adrian
had
contrived
to
raise
a
laugh
in
his
neighbourhood
so
that
the
company
was
divided
and
the
camp
split
jollity
returned
to
while
sentiment
held
the
other
ripton
blotted
behind
the
bosom
was
only
lucky
in
securing
a
higher
degree
of
heat
than
was
possible
for
the
rest
are
you
cold
she
would
ask
smiling
charitably
i
am
said
the
mignonne
as
if
to
excuse
her
conduct
you
always
appear
to
be
the
fat
one
sniffed
and
snapped
wo
you
warm
two
mrs
mortimer
said
the
naughty
little
woman
disdain
prevented
any
further
notice
of
her
those
familiar
with
the
ladies
enjoyed
their
sparring
which
was
frequent
the
mignonne
was
heard
to
whisper
that
poor
fellow
will
certainly
be
stewed
very
prettily
the
ladies
took
and
gave
warmth
for
the
air
on
the
water
was
chill
and
misty
adrian
had
beside
him
the
demure
one
who
had
stopped
the
circulation
of
his
anecdote
she
in
nowise
objected
to
the
fair
exchange
but
said
hush
betweenwhiles
past
kew
and
hammersmith
on
the
cool
smooth
water
across
putney
reach
through
battersea
bridge
and
the
city
grew
around
them
and
the
shadows
of
great
slept
athwart
the
moonlight
all
the
ladies
prattled
sweetly
of
a
charming
day
when
they
alighted
on
land
several
cavaliers
crushed
for
the
honour
of
conducting
mount
to
her
home
my
brougham
here
i
shall
go
alone
said
mount
some
one
arrange
my
shawl
she
turned
her
back
to
richard
who
had
a
view
of
a
delicate
neck
as
he
manipulated
with
the
bearing
of
a
mailed
knight
which
way
are
you
going
she
asked
carelessly
and
to
his
reply
as
to
the
direction
said
then
i
can
give
you
a
lift
and
she
took
his
arm
with
a
air
and
walked
up
the
stairs
with
him
ripton
saw
what
had
happened
he
was
going
to
follow
the
portly
dame
retained
him
and
desired
him
to
get
her
a
cab
oh
you
happy
fellow
said
the
mignonne
passing
by
ripton
procured
the
cab
and
stuffed
it
full
without
having
to
get
into
it
himself
try
and
let
him
come
in
too
said
the
persecuting
creature
again
passing
take
liberties
with
pour
men
you
sha
with
me
retorted
the
angry
bosom
and
drove
off
so
she
been
and
gone
and
run
away
and
left
him
after
all
his
trouble
cried
the
pert
little
thing
peering
into
ripton
eyes
now
never
be
so
foolish
as
to
pin
your
faith
to
fat
women
again
there
he
shall
be
made
happy
another
time
she
gave
his
nose
a
comical
tap
and
tripped
away
with
her
possessor
ripton
rather
forgot
his
friend
for
some
minutes
random
thoughts
laid
hold
of
him
cabs
and
carriages
rattled
past
he
was
sure
he
had
been
among
members
of
the
nobility
that
day
though
when
they
went
by
him
now
they
only
recognized
him
with
an
effort
of
the
eyelids
he
began
to
think
of
the
day
with
exultation
as
an
event
recollections
of
the
mignonne
were
captivating
blue
eyes
just
what
i
like
and
such
a
little
impudent
nose
and
red
lips
pouting
the
very
thing
i
like
and
her
hair
darkish
i
think
say
brown
and
so
saucy
and
light
on
her
feet
and
kind
she
is
or
she
would
have
talked
to
me
like
that
thus
with
a
groaning
soul
he
pictured
her
his
reason
voluntarily
consigned
her
to
the
aristocracy
as
a
natural
appanage
but
he
did
amorously
wish
that
fortune
had
made
a
lord
of
him
then
his
mind
reverted
to
mount
and
the
strange
bits
of
the
conversation
he
had
heard
on
the
hill
he
was
not
one
to
suspect
anybody
positively
he
was
timid
of
fixing
a
suspicion
it
hovered
indefinitely
and
clouded
people
without
stirring
him
to
any
resolve
still
the
attentions
of
the
lady
toward
richard
were
queer
he
endeavoured
to
imagine
they
were
in
the
nature
of
things
because
richard
was
so
handsome
that
any
woman
must
take
to
him
but
he
married
said
ripton
and
he
must
go
near
these
people
if
he
married
not
a
high
morality
perhaps
better
than
none
at
all
better
for
the
world
were
it
practised
more
he
thought
of
richard
along
with
that
sparkling
dame
alone
with
her
the
adorable
beauty
of
his
dear
bride
her
pure
heavenly
face
swam
before
him
thinking
of
her
he
lost
sight
of
the
mignonne
who
had
made
him
giddy
he
walked
to
richard
hotel
and
up
and
down
the
street
there
hoping
every
minute
to
hear
his
step
sometimes
fancying
he
might
have
returned
and
gone
to
bed
two
struck
ripton
could
not
go
away
he
was
sure
he
should
not
sleep
if
he
did
at
last
the
cold
sent
him
homeward
and
leaving
the
street
on
the
moonlight
side
of
piccadilly
he
met
his
friend
patrolling
with
his
head
up
and
that
swing
of
the
feet
proper
to
men
who
are
chanting
verses
old
rip
cried
richard
cheerily
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
ripton
muttered
of
his
pleasure
at
meeting
him
i
wanted
to
shake
your
hand
before
i
went
home
richard
smiled
on
him
in
an
amused
kindly
way
that
all
you
may
shake
my
hand
any
day
like
a
true
man
as
you
are
old
rip
i
been
speaking
about
you
do
you
know
that
mount
never
saw
you
all
the
time
at
richmond
or
in
the
boat
oh
ripton
said
well
assured
that
he
was
a
dwarf
you
saw
her
safe
home
yes
i
been
there
for
the
last
couple
of
hours
talking
she
talks
capitally
she
wonderfully
clever
she
very
like
a
man
only
much
nicer
i
like
her
but
richard
excuse
me
i
sure
i
do
mean
to
offend
you
but
now
you
married
perhaps
you
could
help
seeing
her
home
but
i
think
you
really
indeed
ought
to
have
gone
upstairs
ripton
delivered
this
opinion
with
a
modest
impressiveness
what
do
you
mean
said
richard
you
do
suppose
i
care
for
any
woman
but
my
little
darling
down
there
he
laughed
no
of
course
not
that
absurd
what
i
mean
is
that
people
perhaps
will
you
know
they
do
they
say
all
manner
of
things
and
that
makes
unhappiness
and
i
do
wish
you
were
going
home
ricky
i
mean
to
your
dear
wife
ripton
blushed
and
looked
away
as
he
spoke
the
hero
gave
one
of
his
scornful
glances
so
you
anxious
about
my
reputation
i
hate
that
way
of
looking
on
women
because
they
have
been
once
misled
look
how
much
weaker
they
are
because
the
world
has
given
them
an
ill
fame
you
would
treat
them
as
contagious
and
keep
away
from
them
for
the
sake
of
your
character
it
would
be
different
with
me
quoth
ripton
how
asked
the
hero
because
i
worse
than
you
was
all
the
logical
explanation
ripton
was
capable
of
i
do
hope
you
will
go
home
soon
he
added
yes
said
richard
and
i
so
do
i
hope
so
but
i
work
to
do
now
i
dare
not
i
can
not
leave
it
lucy
would
be
the
last
to
ask
me
you
saw
her
letter
yesterday
now
listen
to
me
rip
i
want
to
make
you
be
just
to
women
then
he
read
ripton
a
lecture
on
erring
women
speaking
of
them
as
if
he
had
known
them
and
studied
them
for
years
clever
beautiful
but
betrayed
by
love
it
was
the
first
duty
of
all
true
men
to
cherish
and
redeem
them
we
turn
them
into
curses
rip
these
divine
creatures
and
the
world
suffered
for
it
that
that
was
the
root
of
all
the
evil
in
the
world
i
do
feel
anger
or
horror
at
these
poor
women
rip
it
strange
i
knew
what
they
were
when
we
came
home
in
the
boat
but
i
do
it
tears
my
heart
to
see
a
young
girl
given
over
to
an
old
man
a
man
she
love
that
shame
do
speak
of
it
forgetting
to
contest
the
premiss
that
all
betrayed
women
are
betrayed
by
love
ripton
was
quite
silenced
he
like
most
young
men
had
pondered
somewhat
on
this
matter
and
was
inclined
to
be
sentimental
when
be
was
not
hungry
they
walked
in
the
moonlight
by
the
railings
of
the
park
richard
harangued
at
leisure
while
ripton
teeth
chattered
chivalry
might
be
dead
but
still
there
was
something
to
do
went
the
strain
the
lady
of
the
day
had
not
been
thrown
in
the
hero
path
without
an
object
he
said
and
he
was
sadly
right
there
he
did
not
express
the
thing
clearly
nevertheless
ripton
understood
him
to
mean
he
intended
to
rescue
that
lady
from
further
transgressions
and
show
a
certain
scorn
of
the
world
that
lady
and
then
other
ladies
unknown
were
to
be
rescued
ripton
was
to
help
he
and
ripton
were
to
be
the
knights
of
this
enterprise
when
appealed
to
ripton
acquiesced
and
shivered
not
only
were
they
to
be
knights
they
would
have
to
be
titans
for
the
powers
of
the
world
the
spurious
ruling
social
gods
would
have
to
be
defied
and
overthrown
and
titan
number
one
flung
up

strained
the
upper
button
of
his
coat
to
meet
across
his
on
his
chest
and
warmed
his
fingers
under
his
tails
the
moon
had
fallen
from
her
high
seat
and
was
in
the
mists
of
the
west
when
he
was
allowed
to
seek
his
blankets
and
the
cold
acting
on
his
friend
eloquence
made
ripton
flesh
very
contrite
the
poor
fellow
had
thinner
blood
than
the
hero
but
his
heart
was
good
by
the
time
he
had
got
a
little
warmth
about
him
his
heart
gratefully
strove
to
encourage
him
in
the
conception
of
becoming
a
knight
and
a
titan
and
so
striving

fell
asleep
and

chapter
xxxvii
behold
the
hero
embarked
in
the
redemption
of
an
erring
beautiful
woman
alas
writes
the
pilgrim
at
this
very
time
to
lady
blandish
i
can
not
get
that
legend
of
the
serpent
from
me
the
more
i
think
has
he
not
caught
you
and
ranked
you
foremost
in
his
legions
for
see
till
you
were
fashioned
the
fruits
hung
immobile
on
the
boughs
they
swayed
before
us
glistening
and
cold
the
hand
must
be
eager
that
plucked
them
they
did
not
come
down
to
us
and
smile
and
speak
our
language
and
read
our
thoughts
and
know
when
to
fly
when
to
follow
how
surely
to
have
us
do
but
mark
one
of
you
standing
openly
in
the
track
of
the
serpent
what
shall
be
done
with
her
i
fear
the
world
is
wiser
than
its
judges
turn
from
her
says
the
world
by
day
the
sons
of
the
world
do
it
darkens
and
they
dance
together
downward
then
comes
there
one
of
the
world
elect
who
deems
old
counsel
devilish
indifference
to
the
end
of
evil
worse
than
its
pursuit
he
comes
to
reclaim
her
from
deepest
bane
will
he
bring
her
back
to
highest
blessing
is
not
that
a
bait
already
poor
fish
is
wondrous
flattering
the
serpent
has
slimed
her
so
to
secure
him
with
slow
weary
steps
he
draws
her
into
light
she
clings
to
him
she
is
human
part
of
his
work
and
he
loves
it
as
they
mount
upward
he
looks
on
her
more
while
she
it
may
be
looks
above
what
has
touched
him
what
has
passed
out
of
her
and
into
him
the
serpent
laughs
below
at
the
gateways
of
the
sun
they
fall
together
this
alliterative
production
was
written
without
any
sense
of
the
peril
that
makes
prophecy
it
suited
sir
austin
to
write
thus
it
was
a
channel
to
his
acrimony
moderated
through
his
philosophy
the
letter
was
a
reply
to
a
vehement
entreaty
from
lady
blandish
for
him
to
come
up
to
richard
and
forgive
him
thoroughly
richard
name
was
not
mentioned
in
it
he
tries
to
be
more
than
he
is
thought
the
lady
and
she
began
insensibly
to
conceive
him
less
than
he
was
the
baronet
was
conscious
of
a
certain
false
gratification
in
his
apparent
obedience
to
his
wishes
and
complete
submission
a
gratification
he
chose
to
accept
as
his
due
without
dissecting
or
accounting
for
it
the
intelligence
reiterating
that
richard
waited
and
still
waited
richard
letters
and
more
his
dumb
abiding
and
practical
penitence
vindicated
humanity
sufficiently
to
stop
the
course
of
virulent
aphorisms
he
could
speak
we
have
seen
in
sorrow
for
this
frail
nature
of
ours
that
he
had
once
stood
forth
to
champion
but
how
long
will
this
last
he
demanded
with
the
air
of
hippias
he
did
not
reflect
how
long
it
had
lasted
indeed
his
indigestion
of
wrath
had
made
of
him
a
moral
dyspepsy
it
was
not
mere
obedience
that
held
richard
from
the
aims
of
his
young
wife
nor
was
it
this
new
knightly
enterprise
he
had
presumed
to
undertake
hero
as
he
was
a
youth
open
to
the
insane
promptings
of
hot
blood
he
was
not
a
fool
there
had
been
talk
between
him
and
doria
of
his
mother
now
that
he
had
broken
from
his
father
his
heart
spoke
for
her
she
lived
he
knew
he
knew
no
more
words
painfully
hovering
along
the
borders
of
plain
speech
had
been
communicated
to
him
filling
him
with
moody
imaginings
if
he
thought
of
her
the
red
was
on
his
face
though
he
could
not
have
said
why
but
now
after
canvassing
the
conduct
of
his
father
and
throwing
him
aside
as
a
terrible
riddle
he
asked
doria
to
tell
him
of
his
other
parent
as
softly
as
she
could
she
told
the
story
to
her
the
shame
was
past
she
could
weep
for
the
poor
lady
richard
dropped
no
tears
disgrace
of
this
kind
is
always
present
to
a
son
and
educated
as
he
had
been
these
tidings
were
a
vivid
fire
in
his
brain
he
resolved
to
hunt
her
out
and
take
her
from
the
man
here
was
work
set
to
his
hand
all
her
dear
husband
did
was
right
to
lucy
she
encouraged
him
to
stay
for
that
purpose
thinking
it
also
served
another
there
was
tom
bakewell
to
watch
over
lucy
there
was
work
for
him
to
do
whether
it
would
please
his
father
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
as
to
the
justice
of
the
act
let
us
say
nothing
on
ripton
devolved
the
humbler
task
of
grubbing
for
sandoe
place
of
residence
and
as
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
name
by
which
the
poet
now
went
in
private
his
endeavours
were
not
immediately
successful
the
friends
met
in
the
evening
at
lady
blandish
or
at
the
foreys
where
doria
procured
the
reverer
of
the
royal
martyr
and
staunch
conservative
a
favourable
reception
pity
deep
pity
for
richard
conduct
ripton
saw
breathing
out
of
doria
algernon
feverel
treated
his
nephew
with
a
sort
of
rough
commiseration
as
a
young
fellow
who
had
run
off
the
road
pity
was
in
lady
blandish
eyes
though
for
a
different
cause
she
doubted
if
she
did
well
in
seconding
his
father
unwise
scheme
supposing
him
to
have
a
scheme
she
saw
the
young
husband
encompassed
by
dangers
at
a
critical
time
not
a
word
of
mount
had
been
breathed
to
her
but
the
lady
had
some
knowledge
of
life
she
touched
on
delicate
verges
to
the
baronet
in
her
letters
and
he
understood
her
well
enough
if
he
loves
this
person
to
whom
he
has
bound
himself
what
fear
for
him
or
are
you
coming
to
think
it
something
that
bears
the
name
of
love
because
we
have
to
veil
the
rightful
appellation
so
he
responded
remote
among
the
mountains
she
tried
very
hard
to
speak
plainly
finally
he
came
to
say
that
he
denied
himself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
son
specially
that
he
for
a
time
might
be
put
to
the
test
the
lady
seemed
to
dread
this
was
almost
too
much
for
lady
blandish
charity
boy
so
loftily
serene
now
that
she
saw
him
half
denuded
a
thing
of
shanks
and
wrists
was
a
trial
for
her
true
heart
going
home
at
night
richard
would
laugh
at
the
faces
made
about
his
marriage
we
carry
the
day
rip
my
lucy
and
i
or
i
do
it
there
is
to
do
he
slightly
adverted
to
a
natural
want
of
courage
in
women
which
ripton
took
to
indicate
that
his
beauty
was
deficient
in
that
quality
up
leapt
the
old
dog
i
sure
there
never
was
a
braver
creature
upon
earth
richard
she
as
brave
as
she
lovely
i
swear
she
is
look
how
she
behaved
that
day
how
her
voice
sounded
she
was
trembling
brave
she
follow
you
into
battle
richard
and
richard
rejoined
talk
on
dear
old
rip
she
my
darling
love
whatever
she
is
and
she
is
gloriously
lovely
no
eyes
are
like
hers
i
go
down
morning
the
first
thing
ripton
only
wondered
the
husband
of
such
a
treasure
could
remain
apart
from
it
so
thought
richard
for
a
space
but
if
i
go
rip
he
said
despondently
if
i
go
for
a
day
even
i
shall
have
undone
all
my
work
with
my
father
she
says
it
herself
you
saw
it
in
her
last
letter
yes
ripton
assented
and
the
words
please
remember
me
to
dear
thompson
fluttered
about
the
old
dog
heart
it
came
to
pass
that
berry
having
certain
business
that
led
her
through
kensington
gardens
spied
a
figure
that
she
had
once
dandled
in
long
clothes
and
helped
make
a
man
of
if
ever
woman
did
he
was
walking
under
the
trees
beside
a
lady
talking
to
her
not
indifferently
the
gentleman
was
her
bridegroom
and
her
babe
i
know
his
back
said
berry
as
if
she
had
branded
a
mark
on
it
in
infancy
but
the
lady
was
not
her
bride
berry
diverged
from
the
path
and
got
before
them
on
the
left
flank
she
stared
retreated
and
came
round
upon
the
right
there
was
that
in
the
lady
face
which
berry
did
not
like
her
innermost
question
was
why
he
was
not
walking
with
his
own
wife
she
stopped
in
front
of
them
they
broke
and
passed
about
her
the
lady
made
a
laughing
remark
to
him
whereat
he
turned
to
look
and
berry
bobbed
she
had
to
bob
a
second
time
and
then
he
remembered
the
worthy
creature
and
hailed
her
penelope
shaking
her
hand
so
that
he
put
her
in
countenance
again
berry
was
extremely
agitated
he
dismissed
her
promising
to
call
upon
her
in
the
evening
she
heard
the
lady
slip
out
something
from
a
side
of
her
lip
and
they
both
laughed
as
she
toddled
off
to
a
sheltering
tree
to
wipe
a
corner
of
each
eye
i
do
like
the
looks
of
that
woman
she
said
and
repeated
it
resolutely
why
does
he
walk
with
her
was
her
neat
inquiry
where
his
wife
succeeded
it
after
many
interrogations
of
the
sort
she
arrived
at
naming
the
lady
a
thing
adding
subsequently
brazen
the
lady
had
apparently
shown
berry
that
she
wished
to
get
rid
of
her
and
had
checked
the
outpouring
of
her
emotions
on
the
breast
of
her
babe
i
know
a
lady
when
i
see
one
said
berry
i
have
lived
with
for
nothing
and
if
she
a
lady
bred
and
born
i
was
married
in
the
church
alive
then
if
not
a
lady
what
was
she
berry
desired
to
know
imitation
lady
i
sure
she
is
berry
vowed
i
say
she
do
look
proper
establishing
the
lady
to
be
a
spurious
article
however
what
was
one
to
think
of
a
married
man
in
company
with
such
oh
no
it
ai
that
berry
returned
immediately
on
the
charitable
tack
belike
some
one
of
his
acquaintance
married
her
for
her
looks
and
just
met
her
why
it
be
as
bad
as
my
berry
the
relinquished
spouse
of
berry
ejaculated
in
horror
at
the
idea
of
a
second
man
being
so
monstrous
in
wickedness
just
coupled
too
berry
groaned
on
the
suspicious
side
of
the
debate
and
such
a
sweet
young
thing
for
his
wife
but
no
i
never
believe
it
not
if
he
tell
me
so
himself
and
men
do
do
that
she
whimpered
women
are
swift
at
coming
to
conclusions
in
these
matters
soft
women
exceedingly
swift
and
soft
women
who
have
been
betrayed
are
rapid
beyond
measure
berry
had
not
cogitated
long
ere
she
pronounced
distinctly
and
without
a
shadow
of
dubiosity
my
opinion
is
married
or
not
married
and
wheresomever
he
pick
her
up
she
nothin
more
nor
less
than
a
bella
donna
as
which
poisonous
plant
she
forthwith
registered
the
lady
in
the
botanical
of
her
brain
it
would
have
astonished
mount
to
have
heard
her
person
so
accurately
hit
off
at
a
glance
in
the
evening
richard
made
good
his
promise
accompanied
by
ripton
berry
opened
the
door
to
them
she
could
not
wait
to
get
him
into
the
parlour
you
my
own
blessed
babe
and
i
as
good
as
your
mother
though
i
did
suck
ye
bein
a
maid
she
cried
falling
into
his
arms
while
richard
did
his
best
to
support
the
unexpected
burden
then
reproaching
him
tenderly
for
his
guile
at
mention
of
which
ripton
chuckled
deeming
it
his
own
most
honourable
portion
of
the
plot
berry
led
them
into
the
parlour
and
revealed
to
richard
who
she
was
and
how
she
had
tossed
him
and
hugged
him
and
kissed
him
all
over
when
he
was
only
that
big
showing
him
her
stumpy
fat
arm
i
kissed
ye
from
head
to
tail
i
did
said
berry
and
you
need
be
ashamed
of
it
it
be
hoped
you
never
have
nothin
worse
come
my
dear
richard
assured
her
he
was
not
a
bit
ashamed
but
warned
her
that
she
must
not
do
it
now
berry
admitting
it
was
out
of
the
question
now
and
now
that
he
had
a
wife
moreover
the
young
men
laughed
and
ripton
laughing
drew
on
himself
berry
attention
but
that
thompson
there
however
he
can
look
me
in
the
face
after
his
helping
blindfold
an
old
woman
though
i
ai
sorry
for
what
i
did
that
i
free
for
to
say
and
its
over
and
blessed
be
all
amen
so
now
where
is
she
and
how
is
she
richard
my
dear
only
cuttin
off
the
and
you
are
as
you
why
did
ye
bring
her
with
ye
to
see
her

richard
hurriedly
explained
that
lucy
was
still
in
the
isle
of
wight
oh
and
you
left
her
for
a
day
or
two
said
berry
good

i
wish
it
had
been
a
day
or
two
cried
richard
ah
and
how
long
have
it
been
asked
berry
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
at
his
manner
of
speaking
do
talk
about
it
said
richard
oh

been
dudgeonin
already
oh
you
have
been
peckin
at
one
another
yet
berry
exclaimed
ripton
interposed
to
tell
her
such
fears
were
unfounded
then
how
long
ha
you
been
divided
in
a
guilty
voice
ripton
stammered
since
september
september
breathed
berry
counting
on
her
fingers
september

waiting

said
richard
a
few
more
words
helped
berry
to
comprehend
the
condition
of
affairs
then
berry
spread
her
lap
flattened
out
her
hands
fixed
her
eyes
and
spoke
my
dear
young
gentleman

so
i
tell
ye
berry
went
to
service
he
left
the
wife

forlorn
and
he

because

an
ambitious

and

to
speak
happy

of
his
uniform
which
was
his
livery
not

strong
and
his
flesh
was
weak
then
what
i
say
is
that
for
a
young
married
man
be
he
whomsoever
he
may
be
to
be
separated
from
the
wife
of
his
bosom
a
young
sweet
thing
and
he
an
innocent
young
gentleman
so
to
sunder
in
their
state
and
be
from
each
other
i
say
it
as
bad
as
bad
can
be
for
what
is
matrimony
my
dears
we
told
it
a
holy
ordnance
and
why
are
ye
so
comfortable
in
matrimony
for
that
ye
are
not
a
sinnin
and
they
that
severs
ye
they
tempts
ye
to
stray
and
you
learn
too
late
the
meanin
them
blessin
of
the
priest
as
it
was
ordained
separate
what
comes
fust
it
like
the
circulation
of
your
blood
all
goes
wrong
then
there
misunderstandings
ye
both
lost
the
key
then
behold
ye
there
birds
o
prey
hoverin
over
each
on
ye
and
it
which
be
snapped
up
fust
then
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
be
like
the
devil
come
into
the
world
again
berry
struck
her
hands
and
moaned
a
day
i
give
ye
i
go
so
far
as
a
week
but
there
the
outside
three
months
dwellin
apart
that
not
matrimony
it
divorcin
what
can
it
be
to
her
but
widowhood
widowhood
with
no
cap
to
show
for
it
and
what
can
it
be
to
you
my
dear
think
you
been
a
bachelor
three
months
and
a
bachelor
man
berry
shook
her
head
most
dolefully
he
widow
woman
i
do
go
to
compare
you
to
berry
my
dear
young
gentleman
some
men
hearts
is
vagabonds
born
they
must
go
astray
it
their
natur
to
but
all
men
are
men
and
i
know
the
foundation
of
by
reason
of
my
woe
berry
paused
richard
was
humorously
respectful
to
the
sermon
the
truth
in
the
good
creature
address
was
not
to
be
disputed
or
despised
notwithstanding
the
inclination
to
laugh
provoked
by
her
quaint
way
of
putting
it
ripton
nodded
encouragingly
at
every
sentence
for
he
saw
her
drift
and
wished
to
second
it
seeking
for
an
illustration
of
her
meaning
berry
solemnly
continued
we
all
know
what
checked
prespiration
is
but
neither
of
the
young
gentlemen
could
resist
this
out
they
burst
in
a
roar
of
laughter
laugh
away
said
berry
i
do
mind
ye
i
say
again
we
all
do
know
what
checked
prespiration
is
it
fly
to
the
lungs
it
gives
ye
mortal
inflammation
and
it
carries
ye
off
then
i
say
checked
matrimony
is
as
bad
it
fly
to
the
heart
and
it
carries
off
the
virtue
that
in
ye
and
you
might
as
well
be
dead
them
that
is
joined
it
their
salvation
not
to
separate
it
do
so
much
matter
before
it
that
thompson
there
if
he
go
astray
it
ai
from
the
blessed
fold
he
hurt
himself
alone
not
double
and
belike
treble
for
who
can
say
now
what
may
be
there
time
for
it
i
for
holding
back
young
people
so
that
they
knows
their
minds
howsomever
they
rattles
about
their
hearts
i
ai
a
speeder
of
matrimony
and
good
my
reason
but
where
it
been
done
where
they
lawfully
joined
and
their
bodies
made
one
i
do
say
this
that
to
put
division
between
then
it
to
make
comets
of
creatures
without
a
objeck
and
no
soul
can
say
what
they
good
for
but
to
rush
about
berry
here
took
a
heavy
breath
as
one
who
has
said
her
utmost
for
the
time
being
my
dear
old
girl
richard
went
up
to
her
and
applauding
her
on
the
shoulder
you
a
very
wise
old
woman
but
you
must
speak
to
me
as

that
you
must
ask
her
the
fact

little
timid
girl
she

and
when
i
made
all
right
then

a
little
timid
girl
cried
berry

a
rock

in
that
for
what
the
consequence
here

i
berry
smoothed
down
the
back
of
her
hand
mournfully
here

i
in
a
strange
ring
that
like
a
strange
man
holdin
of
me
and
me
wearin
of

said
richard
who
thought
he
knew
i
agree
with
you
berry
ripton
struck
in
richard
would
do
anything
in
the
world
her
husband
asked
her
i
quite
sure
bless
you
for
your
good
opinion
thompson

she
frail
on
her
feet

in
the
eyes

ai
one
of
your
misses

ceremony

ripton
and
if
you
ha
seen
her
when
she
spoke
to
me
about
my
ring
depend
upon
it
my
dear
richard
if
she
blinded
you
about
the
nerve

was
somethin
she
thought
she
ought
to
do
for
your
sake
and
i
wish
i

by
to
counsel
her
poor
blessed
babe
and
how
much
longer
now
can
ye
stay
divided
from
that
darlin
richard
paced
up
and
down
a
father
will
urged
berry
that
a
son
law
but
he
go
again
the
laws
of
his
nature
to
do
it
just
be
quiet
at
present
talk
of
other
things
there
a
good
woman
said
richard
berry
meekly
folded
her
arms
how
strange
now
our
meetin
like
this
meetin
at
all
too
she
remarked
contemplatively
it
them
advertisements
they
brings
people
together
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
good
or
for
bad
i
often
say
there
more
lucky
accidents
or
unlucky
ones
since
advertisements
was
the
rule
than
ever
there
was
before
they
make
a
number
of
romances
depend
upon
it
do
you
walk
much
in
the
gardens
my
dear
now
and
then
said
richard
very
pleasant
it
is
there
with
the
fine
folks
and
flowers
and
titled
people
continued
berry
that
was
a
handsome
woman
you
was
walkin
beside
this
mornin
very
said
richard
she
was
a
handsome
woman
or
i
should
say
is
for
her
day
ai
past
and
she
know
it
i
thought
at
first
by
her
back
it
might
ha
been
your
aunt
forey
for
she
do
step
out
well
and
hold
up
her
shoulders
straight
as
a
dart
she
be
but
when
i
come
to
see
her
face
oh
dear
me
says
i
this
ai
one
of
the
family
they
none
of
got
such
bold
faces
nor
no
lady
as
i
know
have
but
she
a
fine
woman
that
nobody
can
gainsay
berry
talked
further
of
the
fine
woman
it
was
a
liberty
she
took
to
speak
in
this
disrespectful
tone
of
her
and
berry
was
quite
aware
that
she
was
laying
herself
open
to
rebuke
she
had
her
end
in
view
no
rebuke
was
uttered
and
during
her
talk
she
observed
intercourse
passing
between
the
eyes
of
the
young
men
look
here
penelope
richard
stopped
her
at
last
will
it
make
you
comfortable
if
i
tell
you
i
obey
the
laws
of
my
nature
and
go
down
at
the
end
of
the
week
i
thank
the
lord
of
heaven
if
you
do
she
exclaimed
very
well
then
be
happy
i
will
now
listen
i
want
you
to
keep
your
rooms
for
me
those
she
had
i
expect
in
a
day
or
two
to
bring
a
lady
here
a
lady
faltered
berry
yes
a
lady
may
i
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
what
lady
you
may
not
not
now
of
course
you
will
know
berry
short
neck
made
the
best
imitation
it
could
of
an
offended
swan
action
she
was
very
angry
she
said
she
did
not
like
so
many
ladies
which
natural
objection
richard
met
by
saying
that
there
was
only
one
lady
and
berry
he
added
dropping
his
voice
you
will
treat
her
as
you
did
my
dear
girl
for
she
will
require
not
only
shelter
but
kindness
i
would
rather
leave
her
with
you
than
with
any
one
she
has
been
very
unfortunate
his
serious
air
and
habitual
tone
of
command
fascinated
the
softness
of
berry
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
gone
that
she
spoke
out
he
going
to
bring
me
an
female
oh
not
from
my
babe
can
i
bear
that
never
will
i
have
her
here
i
see
it
it
that
woman
he
got
mixed
up
in
and
she
been
and
made
the
young
man
think
he
go
for
to
reform
her
it
one
o
their
arts
that
is
and
he
too
innocent
a
young
man
to
mean
anythin
else
but
i
ai
a
house
of
magdalens
no
and
sooner
than
have
her
here
i
have
the
roof
fall
over
me
i
would
she
sat
down
to
eat
her
supper
on
the
sublime
resolve
in
love
berry
charity
was
all
on
the
side
of
the
law
and
this
is
the
case
with
many
of
her
sisters
the
pilgrim
sneers
at
them
for
it
and
would
have
us
credit
that
it
is
their
admirable
instinct
which
at
the
expense
of
every
virtue
save
one
preserves
the
artificial
barrier
simply
to
impose
upon
us
men
i
presume
are
hardly
fair
judges
and
should
stand
aside
and
mark
early
next
day
berry
bundled
off
to
richard
hotel
to
let
him
know
her
determination
she
did
not
find
him
there
returning
homeward
through
the
park
she
beheld
him
on
horseback
riding
by
the
side
of
the
identical
lady
the
sight
of
this
public
exposure
shocked
her
more
than
the
secret
walk
under
the
trees
you
do
look
near
your
reform
yet
berry
apostrophized
her
you
do
look
to
me
one
that
come
the
fair
penitent
till
you
left
off
bein
fair
if
then
you
do
which
some
of
ye
do
laugh
away
and
show
yet
airs
spite
o
your
hat
and
feather
and
your
ridin
habit
you
a
belle
donna
setting
her
down
again
absolutely
for
such
whatever
it
might
signify
berry
had
a
virtuous
glow
in
the
evening
she
heard
the
noise
of
wheels
stopping
at
the
door
never
she
rose
from
her
chair
to
exclaim
he
ai
rided
her
out
in
the
mornin
and
been
and
made
a
magdalen
of
her
afore
dark
a
lady
veiled
was
brought
into
the
house
by
richard
berry
feebly
tried
to
bar
his
progress
in
the
passage
he
pushed
past
her
and
conducted
the
lady
into
the
parlour
without
speaking
berry
did
not
follow
she
heard
him
murmur
a
few
sentences
within
then
he
came
out
all
her
crest
stood
up
as
she
whispered
vigorously
richard
if
that
woman
stay
here
i
go
forth
my
house
ai
a
penitentiary
for
females
sir
he
frowned
at
her
curiously
but
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
renewing
her
indignant
protest
he
clapped
his
hand
across
her
mouth
and
spoke
words
in
her
ear
that
had
awful
import
to
her
she
trembled
breathing
low
my
god
forgive
me
richard
and
her
virtue
was
humbled
lady
feverel
is
it
your
mother
mr
richard
and
her
virtue
was
humbled
chapter
xxxviii
one
may
suppose
that
a
prematurely
aged
oily
little
man
a
poet
in
bad
circumstances
a
decrepit
butterfly
chained
to
a
disappointed
inkstand
will
not
put
out
strenuous
energies
to
retain
his
ancient
paramour
when
a
robust
young
man
comes
imperatively
to
demand
his
mother
of
him
in
her
person
the
colloquy
was
short
between
diaper
sandoe
and
richard
the
question
was
referred
to
the
poor
spiritless
lady
who
seeing
that
her
son
made
no
question
of
it
cast
herself
on
his
hands
small
loss
to
her
was
diaper
but
he
was
the
loss
of
habit
and
that
is
something
to
a
woman
who
has
lived
the
blood
of
her
son
had
been
running
so
long
alien
from
her
that
the
sense
of
her
motherhood
smote
he
now
with
strangeness
and
richard
stern
gentleness
seemed
like
dreadful
justice
come
upon
her
her
heart
had
almost
forgotten
its
maternal
functions
she
called
him
sir
till
he
bade
her
remember
he
was
her
son
her
voice
sounded
to
him
like
that
of
a
lamb
so
painful
and
weak
it
was
with
the
plaintive
stop
in
the
utterance
when
he
kissed
her
her
skin
was
cold
her
thin
hand
fell
out
of
his
when
his
grasp
related
can
sin
hunt
one
like
this
he
asked
bitterly
reproaching
himself
for
the
shame
she
had
caused
him
to
endure
and
a
deep
compassion
filled
his
breast
poetic
justice
had
been
dealt
to
diaper
the
poet
he
thought
of
all
he
had
sacrificed
for
this
woman
the
comfortable
quarters
the
friend
the
happy
flights
he
could
not
but
accuse
her
of
unfaithfulness
in
leaving
him
in
his
old
age
habit
had
legalized
his
union
with
her
he
wrote
as
pathetically
of
the
break
of
habit
as
men
feel
at
the
death
of
love
and
when
we
are
old
and
have
no
fair
hope
tossing
golden
locks
before
us
a
wound
to
this
our
second
nature
is
quite
as
sad
i
know
not
even
if
it
be
not
actually
sadder
day
by
day
richard
visited
his
mother
lady
blandish
and
ripton
alone
were
in
the
secret
adrian
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
he
thought
proper
to
tell
him
that
the
public
recognition
he
accorded
to
a
particular
lady
was
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
scarcely
prudent
is
a
proof
to
me
of
your
moral
rectitude
my
son
but
the
world
will
not
think
so
no
one
character
is
sufficient
to
cover
two
in
a
protestant
country
especially
the
divinity
that
doth
hedge
a
bishop
would
have
no
chance
in
contact
with
your
madam
danae
drop
the
woman
my
son
or
permit
me
to
speak
what
you
would
have
her
hear
richard
listened
to
him
with
disgust
well
you
had
my
doctorial
warning
said
adrian
and
plunged
back
into
his
book
when
lady
feverel
had
revived
to
take
part
in
the
consultations
berry
perpetually
opened
on
the
subject
of
richard
matrimonial
duty
another
chain
was
cast
about
him
do
not
oh
do
not
offend
your
father
was
her
one
repeated
supplication
sir
austin
had
grown
to
be
a
vindictive
phantom
in
her
mind
she
never
wept
but
when
she
said
this
so
berry
to
whom
richard
had
once
made
mention
of
lady
blandish
as
the
only
friend
he
had
among
women
bundled
off
in
her
dress
to
obtain
an
interview
with
her
and
an
ally
after
coming
to
an
understanding
on
the
matter
of
the
visit
and
reiterating
many
of
her
views
concerning
young
married
people
berry
said
my
lady
if
i
may
speak
so
bold
i
say
the
sin
that
bein
done
is
the
sin
o
the
and
when
everybody
appear
frightened
by
that
young
gentleman
father
i
say
hopin
your
pardon
they
no
cause
be
frighted
at
all
for
though
it
nigh
twenty
year
since
i
knew
him
and
i
knew
him
then
just
sixteen
months
no
more
i
say
his
heart
as
soft
as
a
woman
which
i
cause
for
to
know
and
that
it
where
everybody
deceived
by
him
and
i
was
it
because
he
keeps
his
face
and
makes
ye
think
you
dealin
with
a
man
of
iron
and
all
the
while
there
a
woman
underneath
and
a
man
that
like
a
woman
he
the
puzzle
o
life
we
can
see
through
ourselves
my
lady
and
we
can
see
through
men
but
one
o
that
sort
he
like
somethin
out
of
nature
then
i
say
hopin
be
excused
what
to
do
is
for
to
treat
him
like
a
woman
and
not
for
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
which
he
do
know
himself
and
is
why
nobody
else
do
let
that
sweet
young
couple
come
together
and
be
wholesome
in
spite
of
him
i
say
and
then
give
him
time
to
come
round
just
like
a
woman
and
round
he
come
and
give
his
blessin
and
we
shall
know
we
made
him
comfortable
he
angry
because
matrimony
have
come
between
him
and
his
son
and
he
he
wantin
to
treat
what
is
as
if
it
is
but
matrimony
a
holier
than
him
it
began
long
long
before
him
and
it
be
hoped
will
endoor
longs
the
time
after
if
the
world
not
coming
to
rack
wishin
him
no
harm
now
berry
only
put
lady
blandish
thoughts
in
bad
english
the
lady
took
upon
herself
seriously
to
advise
richard
to
send
for
his
wife
he
wrote
bidding
her
come
lucy
however
had
wits
and
inexperienced
wits
are
as
a
little
knowledge
in
pursuance
of
her
sage
plan
to
make
the
family
feel
her
worth
and
to
conquer
the
members
of
it
one
by
one
she
had
got
up
a
correspondence
with
adrian
whom
it
tickled
adrian
constantly
assured
her
all
was
going
well
time
would
heal
the
wound
if
both
the
offenders
had
the
fortitude
to
be
patient
he
fancied
he
saw
signs
of
the
baronet
relenting
they
must
do
nothing
to
arrest
those
favourable
symptoms
indeed
the
wise
youth
was
languidly
seeking
to
produce
them
he
wrote
and
felt
as
lucy
benefactor
so
lucy
replied
to
her
husband
a
cheerful
rigmarole
he
could
make
nothing
of
save
that
she
was
happy
in
hope
and
still
had
fears
then
berry
trained
her
fist
to
indite
a
letter
to
her
bride
her
bride
answered
it
by
saying
she
trusted
to
time
you
poor
marter
berry
wrote
back
i
know
what
your
sufferin
be
they
is
the
only
kind
a
wife
should
never
hide
from
her
husband
he
thinks
all
sorts
of
things
if
she
can
abide
being
away
and
you
trusting
to
time
why
it
like
trusting
not
to
catch
cold
out
of
your
natural
clothes
there
was
no
shaking
lucy
firmness
richard
gave
it
up
he
began
to
think
that
the
life
lying
behind
him
was
the
life
of
a
fool
what
had
he
done
in
it
he
had
burnt
a
rick
and
got
married
he
associated
the
two
acts
of
his
existence
where
was
the
hero
he
was
to
have
carved
out
of
tom
bakewell
a
wretch
he
had
taught
to
lie
and
chicane
and
for
what
great
heavens
how
ignoble
did
a
flash
from
the
light
of
his
aspirations
make
his
marriage
appear
the
young
man
sought
amusement
he
allowed
his
aunt
to
drag
him
into
society
and
sick
of
that
he
made
late
evening
calls
on
mount
oblivious
of
the
purpose
he
had
in
visiting
her
at
all
her
conversation
which
he
took
for
honesty
was
a
refreshing
change
on
fair
lips
call
me
bella
i
call
you
dick
said
she
and
it
came
to
be
bella
and
dick
between
them
no
mention
of
bella
occurred
in
richard
letters
to
lucy
mount
spoke
quite
openly
of
herself
i
pretend
to
be
no
better
than
i
am
she
said
and
i
know
i
no
worse
than
many
a
woman
who
holds
her
head
high
to
back
this
she
told
him
stories
of
blooming
dames
of
good
repute
and
poured
a
little
social
sewerage
into
his
ears
also
she
understood
him
what
you
want
my
dear
dick
is
something
to
do
you
went
and
got
married
like
a
hum
friends
must
be
respectful
go
into
the
army
try
the
turf
i
can
put
you
up
to
a
trick
or
two
friends
should
make
themselves
useful
she
told
him
what
she
liked
in
him
you
the
only
man
i
was
ever
alone
with
who
do
talk
to
me
of
love
and
make
me
feel
sick
i
hate
men
who
ca
speak
to
a
woman
just
wait
a
minute
she
left
him
and
presently
returned
with
ah
dick
old
fellow
how
are
you
arrayed
like
a
cavalier
one
arm
stuck
in
her
side
her
hat
jauntily
cocked
and
a
pretty
oath
on
her
lips
to
give
reality
to
the
costume
what
do
you
think
of
me
was
it
a
shame
to
make
a
woman
of
me
when
i
was
born
to
be
a
man
i
do
know
that
said
richard
for
the
contrast
in
her
attire
to
those
shooting
eyes
and
lips
aired
her
sex
bewitchingly
what
you
think
i
do
do
it
well
charming
but
i
ca
forget
now
that
is
too
bad
she
pouted
then
she
proposed
that
they
should
go
out
into
the
midnight
streets
and
out
they
went
and
had
great
fits
of
laughter
at
her
impertinent
manner
of
using
her
eyeglass
and
outrageous
affectation
of
the
supreme
dandy
they
take
up
men
dick
for
going
about
in
women
clothes
and
vice
versaw
i
suppose
you
bail
me
old
fellaa
if
i
have
to
make
my
bow
to
the
beak
wo
you
say
it
becas
i
an
honest
woman
and
care
to
hide
the
a
unmentionables
when
i
wear
them
as
the
do
sprinkled
with
the
dandy
famous
invocations
he
began
to
conceive
romance
in
that
sort
of
fun
you
a
wopper
my
brave
dick
wo
let
any
peeler
take
me
by
jove
and
he
with
many
assurances
guaranteed
to
stand
by
her
while
she
bent
her
thin
fingers
trying
the
muscle
of
his
arm
and
reposed
upon
it
more
there
was
delicacy
in
her
dandyism
she
was
a
graceful
cavalier
sir
julius
as
they
named
the
dandy
attire
was
frequently
called
for
on
his
evening
visits
to
mount
when
he
beheld
sir
julius
he
thought
of
the
lady
and
vice
versaw
as
sir
julius
was
fond
of
exclaiming
was
ever
hero
in
this
fashion
wooed
the
woman
now
and
then
would
peep
through
sir
julius
or
she
would
sit
and
talk
and
altogether
forget
she
was
impersonating
that
worthy
fop
she
never
uttered
an
idea
or
a
reflection
but
richard
thought
her
the
cleverest
woman
he
had
ever
met
all
kinds
of
problematic
notions
beset
him
she
was
cold
as
ice
she
hated
talk
about
love
and
she
was
branded
by
the
world
a
rumour
spread
that
reached
doria
ears
she
rushed
to
adrian
first
the
wise
youth
believed
there
was
nothing
in
it
she
sailed
down
upon
richard
is
this
true
that
you
have
been
seen
going
publicly
about
with
an
infamous
woman
richard
tell
me
pray
relieve
me
richard
knew
of
no
person
answering
to
his
aunt
description
in
whose
company
he
could
have
been
seen
tell
me
i
say
do
quibble
do
you
know
any
woman
of
bad
character
the
acquaintance
of
a
lady
very
much
misjudged
and
by
the
world
richard
admitted
to
urgent
grave
advice
doria
tendered
her
nephew
both
from
the
moral
and
the
worldly
point
of
view
mentally
ejaculating
all
the
while
that
ridiculous
system
that
disgraceful
marriage
sir
austin
in
his
mountain
solitude
was
furnished
with
serious
stuff
to
brood
over
the
rumour
came
to
lady
blandish
she
likewise
lectured
richard
and
with
her
he
condescended
to
argue
but
he
found
himself
obliged
to
instance
something
he
had
quite
neglected
instead
of
her
doing
me
harm
it
i
that
will
do
her
good
lady
blandish
shook
her
head
and
held
up
her
finger
this
person
must
be
very
clever
to
have
given
you
that
delusion
dear
she
is
clever
and
the
world
treats
her
shamefully
she
complains
of
her
position
to
you
not
a
word
but
i
will
stand
by
her
she
has
no
friend
but
me
my
poor
boy
has
she
made
you
think
that
how
unjust
you
all
are
cried
richard
how
mad
and
wicked
is
the
man
who
can
let
him
be
tempted
so
thought
lady
blandish
he
would
pronounce
no
promise
not
to
visit
her
not
to
address
her
publicly
the
world
that
condemned
her
and
cast
her
out
was
no
better
worse
for
its
miserable
hypocrisy
he
knew
the
world
now
the
young
man
said
my
child
the
world
may
be
very
bad
i
am
not
going
to
defend
it
but
you
have
some
one
else
to
think
of
have
you
forgotten
you
have
a
wife
richard
ay
you
all
speak
of
her
now
there
my
aunt
you
have
a
wife
do
you
think
i
love
any
one
but
lucy
poor
little
thing
because
i
am
married
am
i
to
give
up
the
society
of
women
of
women
is
she
a
woman
too
much
so
sighed
the
defender
of
her
sex
adrian
became
more
emphatic
in
his
warnings
richard
laughed
at
him
the
wise
youth
sneered
at
mount
the
hero
then
favoured
him
with
a
warning
equal
to
his
own
in
emphasis
and
surpassing
it
in
sincerity
we
wo
quarrel
my
dear
boy
said
adrian
i
a
man
of
peace
besides
we
are
not
fairly
proportioned
for
a
combat
ride
your
steed
to
virtue
goal
all
i
say
is
that
i
think
he
upset
you
and
better
to
go
at
a
slow
pace
and
in
companionship
with
the
children
of
the
sun
you
have
a
very
nice
little
woman
for
a
wife
well
to
have
his
wife
and
the
world
thrown
at
his
face
was
unendurable
to
richard
he
associated
them
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
the
rick
and
the
marriage
charming
sir
julius
always
gay
always
honest
dispersed
his
black
moods
why
you
taller
richard
made
the
discovery
of
course
i
am
do
you
remember
you
said
i
was
such
a
little
thing
when
i
came
out
of
my
woman
shell
and
how
have
you
done
it
grown
to
please
you
now
if
you
can
do
that
you
can
do
anything
and
so
i
would
do
anything
you
would
honour
then
his
project
recurred
to
him
but
the
incongruity
of
speaking
seriously
to
sir
julius
struck
him
dumb
then
what
asked
she
then
you
a
gallant
fellow
that
all
is
it
enough
not
quite
you
were
going
to
say
something
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
you
saw
that
i
admired
you
yes
but
a
man
must
admire
a
man
i
suppose
i
had
an
idea
you
were
a
woman
what
when
i
had
the
heels
of
my
boots
raised
half
an
inch
sir
julius
turned
one
heel
and
volleyed
out
silver
laughter
i
do
come
much
above
your
shoulder
even
now
she
said
and
proceeded
to
measure
her
height
beside
him
with
arch
you
must
grow
more
i
ca
dick
bootmakers
ca
do
it
i
show
you
how
and
he
lifted
sir
julius
lightly
and
bore
the
fair
gentleman
to
the
holding
him
there
exactly
on
a
level
with
his
head
will
that
do
yes
oh
but
i
ca
stay
here
why
ca
you
why
ca
i
he
should
have
known
then
it
was
thundered
at
a
closed
door
in
him
that
he
played
with
fire
but
the
door
being
closed
he
thought
himself
internally
secure
their
eyes
met
he
put
her
down
instantly
sir
julius
charming
as
he
was
lost
his
vogue
seeing
that
the
wily
woman
resumed
her
shell
the
memory
of
sir
julius
breathing
about
her
still
doubled
the
feminine
attraction
i
ought
to
have
been
an
actress
she
said
richard
told
her
he
found
all
natural
women
had
a
similar
wish
yes
ah
then
if
i
had
been
sighed
mount
gazing
on
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
you
are
not
happy
as
you
are
no
may
i
speak
to
you
yes
her
nearest
eye
setting
a
dimple
of
her
cheek
in
motion
slid
to
the
corner
toward
her
ear
as
she
sat
with
her
head
sideways
to
him
listening
when
he
had
gone
she
said
to
herself
old
hypocrites
talk
in
that
way
but
i
never
heard
of
a
young
man
doing
it
and
not
making
love
at
the
same
time
their
next
meeting
displayed
her
quieter
subdued
as
one
who
had
been
set
thinking
he
lauded
her
fair
looks
do
make
me
thrice
ashamed
she
petitioned
but
it
was
not
only
that
mood
with
her
dauntless
defiance
that
splendidly
befitted
her
gallant
outline
and
gave
a
wildness
to
her
bright
bold
eyes
when
she
would
call
out
happy
who
dares
say
i
not
happy
think
if
the
world
whips
me
i
wince
think
i
care
for
what
they
say
or
do
let
them
kill
me
they
shall
never
get
one
cry
out
of
me
and
flashing
on
the
young
man
as
if
he
were
the
congregated
enemy
add
there
now
you
know
me
that
was
a
mood
that
well
became
her
and
helped
the
work
she
ought
to
have
been
an
actress
this
must
not
go
on
said
lady
blandish
and
doria
in
unison
a
common
object
brought
them
together
they
confined
their
talk
to
it
and
did
not
disagree
doria
engaged
to
go
down
to
the
baronet
both
ladies
knew
it
was
a
dangerous
likely
to
turn
out
a
disastrous
expedition
they
agreed
to
it
because
it
was
something
to
do
and
doing
anything
is
better
than
doing
nothing
do
it
said
the
wise
youth
when
they
made
him
a
third
do
it
if
you
want
him
to
be
a
hermit
for
life
you
will
bring
back
nothing
but
his
dead
body
ladies
a
hellenic
rather
than
a
roman
triumph
he
will
listen
to
you
he
will
accompany
you
to
the
station
he
will
hand
you
into
the
carriage
and
when
you
point
to
his
seat
he
will
bow
profoundly
and
retire
into
his
congenial
mists
adrian
spoke
their
thoughts
they
fretted
they
relapsed
speak
to
him
you
adrian
said
doria
speak
to
the
boy
solemnly
it
would
be
almost
better
he
should
go
back
to
that
little
thing
he
has
married
almost
lady
blandish
opened
her
eyes
i
have
been
advising
it
for
the
last
month
and
more
a
choice
of
evils
said
doria
face
and
shake
of
the
head
each
lady
saw
a
point
of
dissension
and
mutually
agreed
with
heroic
effort
to
avoid
it
by
shutting
their
mouths
what
was
more
they
preserved
the
peace
in
spite
of
adrian
artifices
well
i
talk
to
him
again
he
said
i
try
to
get
the
engine
on
the
conventional
line
command
him
exclaimed
doria
gentle
means
are
i
think
the
only
means
with
richard
said
lady
blandish
throwing
banter
aside
as
much
as
he
could
adrian
spoke
to
richard
you
want
to
reform
this
woman
her
manner
is
open
fair
and
free
the
traditional
characteristic
we
wo
stop
to
canvass
how
that
particular
honesty
of
deportment
that
wins
your
approbation
has
been
gained
in
her
college
it
is
not
uncommon
girls
you
know
are
not
like
boys
at
a
certain
age
they
ca
be
quite
natural
it
a
bad
sign
if
they
blush
and
fib
and
affect
this
and
that
it
wears
off
when
women
but
a
woman
who
speaks
like
a
man
and
has
all
those
excellent
virtues
you
admire
where
has
she
learned
the
trick
she
tells
you
you
do
surely
approve
of
the
school
well
what
is
there
in
it
then
reform
her
of
course
the
task
is
worthy
of
your
energies
but
if
you
are
appointed
to
do
it
do
do
it
publicly
and
do
attempt
it
just
now
may
i
ask
you
whether
your
wife
participates
in
this
undertaking
richard
walked
away
from
the
interrogation
the
wise
youth
who
hated
long
unrelieved
speeches
and
had
healed
his
conscience
said
no
more
dear
tender
lucy
poor
darling
richard
eyes
moistened
her
letters
seemed
sadder
latterly
yet
she
never
called
to
him
to
come
or
he
would
have
gone
his
heart
leapt
up
to
her
he
announced
to
adrian
that
he
should
wait
no
longer
for
his
father
adrian
placidly
nodded
the
enchantress
observed
that
her
knight
had
a
clouded
brow
and
an
absent
voice
richard
i
ca
call
you
dick
now
i
really
do
know
why
she
said
i
want
to
beg
a
favour
of
you
name
it
i
can
still
call
you
bella
i
suppose
if
you
care
to
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
when
you
meet
me
out
to
cut
it
short
please
not
to
recognize
me
and
why
do
you
ask
to
be
told
that
certainly
i
do
then
look
i
wo
compromise
you
i
see
no
harm
bella
no
she
caressed
his
hand
and
there
is
none
i
know
that
but
modest
eyelids
were
drooped
other
people
do
struggling
eyes
were
raised
what
do
we
care
for
other
people
nothing
i
do
not
that
snapping
her
finger
i
care
for
you
though
a
prolonged
look
followed
the
declaration
you
foolish
bella
not
quite
so
giddy
that
all
he
did
not
combat
it
with
his
usual
impetuosity
adrian
abrupt
inquiry
had
sunk
in
his
mind
as
the
wise
youth
intended
it
should
he
had
instinctively
refrained
from
speaking
to
lucy
of
this
lady
but
what
a
noble
creature
the
woman
was
so
they
met
in
the
park
mount
whipped
past
him
and
secresy
added
a
new
sense
to
their
intimacy
adrian
was
gratified
at
the
result
produced
by
his
eloquence
though
this
lady
never
expressed
an
idea
richard
was
not
mistaken
in
her
cleverness
she
could
make
evenings
pass
gaily
and
one
was
not
the
fellow
to
the
other
she
could
make
you
forget
she
was
a
woman
and
then
bring
the
fact
startlingly
home
to
you
she
could
read
men
with
one
quiver
of
her
she
could
catch
the
coming
mood
in
a
man
and
fit
herself
to
it
what
does
a
woman
want
with
ideas
who
can
do
thus
much
keenness
of
perception
conformity
delicacy
of
handling
these
be
all
the
qualities
necessary
to
parasites
love
would
have
scared
the
youth
she
banished
it
from
her
tongue
it
may
also
have
been
true
that
it
sickened
her
she
played
on
his
higher
nature
she
understood
spontaneously
what
would
be
most
strange
and
taking
to
him
in
a
woman
various
as
the
serpent
of
old
nile
she
acted
fallen
beauty
humorous
indifference
reckless
daring
arrogance
in
ruin
and
acting
thus
what
think
you
she
did
it
so
well
because
she
was
growing
half
in
earnest
richard
i
am
not
what
i
was
since
i
knew
you
you
will
not
give
me
up
quite
never
bella
i
am
not
so
bad
as
i
painted
you
are
only
unfortunate
now
that
i
know
you
i
think
so
and
yet
i
am
happier
she
told
him
her
history
when
this
soft
horizon
of
repentance
seemed
to
throw
heaven
twilight
across
it
a
woman
history
you
know
certain
chapters
expunged
it
was
dark
enough
to
richard
did
you
love
the
man
he
asked
you
say
you
love
no
one
now
did
i
love
him
he
was
a
nobleman
and
i
a
tradesman
daughter
no
i
did
not
love
him
i
have
lived
to
learn
it
and
now
i
should
hate
him
if
i
did
not
despise
him
can
you
be
deceived
in
love
said
richard
more
to
himself
than
to
her
yes
when
we
young
we
can
be
very
easily
deceived
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
love
we
discover
it
after
we
have
tossed
about
and
roughed
it
then
we
find
the
man
or
the
woman
that
suits
us
and
then
too
late
we
ca
have
him
singular
murmured
richard
she
says
just
what
my
father
said
he
spoke
aloud
i
could
forgive
you
if
you
had
loved
him
do
be
harsh
grave
judge
how
is
a
girl
to
distinguish
you
had
some
affection
for
him
he
was
the
first
she
chose
to
admit
that
yes
and
the
first
who
talks
of
love
to
a
girl
must
be
a
fool
if
he
does
blind
her
that
makes
what
is
called
first
love
nonsense
is
it
he
repelled
the
insinuation
because
i
know
it
is
not
bella
nevertheless
she
had
opened
a
wider
view
of
the
world
to
him
and
a
colder
he
thought
poorly
of
girls
a
woman
a
sensible
brave
beautiful
woman
seemed
on
comparison
infinitely
nobler
than
those
weak
creatures
she
was
best
in
her
character
of
lovely
rebel
accusing
foul
injustice
what
am
i
to
do
you
tell
me
to
be
different
how
can
i
what
am
i
to
do
will
virtuous
people
let
me
earn
my
bread
i
could
not
get
a
housemaid
place
they
would
have
me
i
see
their
noses
smelling
yes
i
can
go
to
the
hospital
and
sing
behind
a
screen
do
you
expect
me
to
bury
myself
alive
why
man
i
have
blood
i
ca
become
a
stone
you
say
i
am
honest
and
i
will
be
then
let
me
till
you
that
i
have
been
used
to
luxuries
and
i
ca
do
without
them
i
might
have
married
men
lots
would
have
had
me
but
who
marries
one
like
me
but
a
fool
and
i
could
not
marry
a
fool
the
man
i
marry
i
must
respect
he
could
not
respect
me
i
should
know
him
to
be
a
fools
and
i
should
be
worse
off
than
i
am
now
as
i
am
now
they
may
look
as
pious
as
they
like
i
laugh
at
them
and
so
forth
direr
things
imputations
upon
wives
horrible
exultation
at
the
universal
peccancy
of
husbands
this
lovely
outcast
almost
made
him
think
she
had
the
right
on
her
side
so
keenly
her
parthian
arrows
pierced
the
holy
centres
of
society
and
exposed
its
rottenness
mount
house
was
discreetly
conducted
nothing
ever
occurred
to
shock
him
there
the
young
man
would
ask
himself
where
the
difference
was
between
her
and
the
women
of
society
how
base
too
was
the
army
of
banded
hypocrites
he
was
ready
to
declare
war
against
them
on
her
behalf
his
casus
beli
accurately
worded
would
have
read
curiously
because
the
world
refused
to
lure
the
lady
to
virtue
with
the
offer
of
a
housemaid
place
our
knight
threw
down
his
challenge
but
the
lady
had
scornfully
rebutted
this
prospect
of
a
return
to
chastity
then
the
form
of
the
challenge
must
be
because
the
world
declined
to
support
the
lady
in
luxury
for
nothing
but
what
did
that
mean
in
other
words
she
was
to
receive
the
devil
wages
without
rendering
him
her
services
such
an
arrangement
appears
hardly
fair
on
the
world
or
on
the
devil
heroes
will
have
to
conquer
both
before
they
will
get
them
to
subscribe
to
it
heroes
however
are
not
in
the
habit
of
wording
their
declarations
of
war
at
all
lance
in
rest
they
challenge
and
they
charge
like
women
they
trust
to
instinct
and
graft
on
it
the
muscle
of
men
wide
fly
the
hosts
institutions
are
scattered
they
know
not
wherefore
heads
are
broken
that
have
not
the
balm
of
a
reason
why
is
instinct
strikes
surely
there
is
something
divine
in
instinct
still
war
declared
where
were
these
hosts
the
hero
could
not
charge
down
on
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
a
ballroom
and
spoil
the
quadrille
he
had
sufficient
reticence
to
avoid
sounding
his
challenge
in
the
law
courts
nor
could
he
well
go
into
the
houses
of
parliament
with
a
trumpet
though
to
come
to
a
tussle
with
the
nation
direct
representatives
did
seem
the
likelier
method
it
was
likewise
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
enter
every
house
and
shop
and
battle
with
its
master
in
the
cause
of
mount
where
then
was
his
enemy
everybody
was
his
enemy
and
everybody
was
nowhere
shall
he
convoke
multitudes
on
wimbledon
common
blue
policemen
and
a
distant
dread
of
ridicule
bar
all
his
projects
alas
for
the
hero
in
our
day
nothing
teaches
a
strong
arm
its
impotence
so
much
as
knocking
at
empty
air
what
can
i
do
for
this
poor
woman
cried
richard
after
fighting
his
phantom
enemy
till
he
was
worn
out
o
rip
old
rip
he
addressed
his
friend
i
distracted
i
wish
i
was
dead
what
good
am
i
for
miserable
selfish
what
have
i
done
but
make
every
soul
i
know
wretched
about
me
i
follow
my
own
inclinations
i
make
people
help
me
by
lying
as
hard
as
they
can
and
i
a
liar
and
when
i
got
it
i
ashamed
of
myself
and
now
when
i
do
see
something
unselfish
for
me
to
do
i
come
upon
grins
i
do
know
where
to
turn
how
to
act
and
i
laugh
at
myself
like
a
devil
it
was
only
friend
ripton
ear
that
was
required
so
his
words
went
for
little
but
ripton
did
say
he
thought
there
was
small
matter
to
be
ashamed
of
in
winning
and
wearing
the
beauty
of
earth
richard
added
his
customary
comment
of
poor
little
thing
he
fought
his
duello
with
empty
air
till
he
was
exhausted
a
last
letter
written
to
his
father
procured
him
no
reply
then
said
he
i
have
tried
my
utmost
i
have
tried
to
be
dutiful
my
father
wo
listen
to
me
one
thing
i
can
do
i
can
go
down
to
my
dear
girl
and
make
her
happy
and
save
her
at
least
from
some
of
the
consequences
of
my
rashness
there
nothing
better
for
me
he
groaned
his
great
ambition
must
be
covered
by
a
he
and
the
cat
must
warm
themselves
on
the
domestic
hearth
the
hero
was
not
aware
that
his
heart
moved
him
to
this
his
heart
was
not
now
in
open
communion
with
his
mind
mount
heard
that
her
friend
was
going
would
go
she
knew
he
was
going
to
his
wife
far
from
discouraging
him
she
said
nobly
go
i
believe
i
have
kept
you
let
us
have
an
evening
together
and
then
go
for
good
if
you
like
if
not
then
to
meet
again
another
time
forget
me
i
sha
forget
you
you
the
best
fellow
i
ever
knew
richard
you
are
on
my
honour
i
swear
i
would
not
step
in
between
you
and
your
wife
to
cause
either
of
you
a
moment
unhappiness
when
i
can
be
another
woman
i
will
and
i
shall
think
of
you
then
lady
blandish
heard
from
adrian
that
richard
was
positively
going
to
his
wife
the
wise
youth
modestly
veiled
his
own
merit
in
bringing
it
about
by
saying
i
could
see
that
poor
little
woman
left
alone
down
there
any
longer
well
yes
said
doria
to
whom
the
modest
speech
was
repeated
i
suppose
poor
boy
it
the
best
he
can
do
now
richard
bade
them
adieu
and
went
to
spend
his
last
evening
with
mount
the
enchantress
received
him
in
state
do
you
know
this
dress
no
it
the
dress
i
wore
when
i
first
met
you
not
when
i
first
saw
you
i
think
i
remarked
you
sir
before
you
deigned
to
cast
an
eye
upon
humble
me
when
we
first
met
we
drank
champagne
together
and
i
intend
to
celebrate
our
parting
in
the
same
liquor
will
you
liquor
with
me
old
boy
she
was
gay
she
revived
sir
julius
occasionally
he
dispirited
left
the
talking
all
to
her
mount
kept
a
footman
at
a
late
hour
the
man
of
calves
dressed
the
table
for
supper
it
was
a
point
of
honour
for
richard
to
sit
down
to
it
and
try
to
eat
drinking
thanks
to
the
kindly
mother
nature
who
loves
to
see
her
children
made
fools
of
is
always
an
easier
matter
the
footman
was
diligent
the
champagne
corks
feebly
recalled
the
at
richmond
we
drink
to
what
we
might
have
been
dick
said
the
enchantress
oh
the
glorious
wreck
she
looked
his
heart
choked
as
he
gulped
the
buzzing
wine
what
down
my
boy
she
cried
they
shall
never
see
me
hoist
signals
of
distress
we
must
all
die
and
the
secret
of
the
thing
is
to
die
game
by
jove
did
you
ever
hear
of
laura
fern
a
superb
girl
handsomer
than
your
humble
servant
if
you
believe
it
a
in
the
bargain
and
as
a
consequence
i
suppose
a
much
greater
rake
she
was
in
the
her
horse
threw
her
and
she
fell
plump
on
a
stake
it
went
into
her
left
breast
all
the
fellows
crowded
round
her
and
one
young
man
who
was
in
love
with
her
he
sits
in
the
house
of
peers
now
we
used
to
call
him
because
he
was
such
a
dear
he
dropped
from
his
horse
to
his
knees
laura
my
darling
speak
a
word
to
me
the
last
she
turned
over
all
white
and
bloody
i
sha
be
in
at
the
death
and
gave
up
the
ghost
was
that
dying
game
here
to
the
example
of
laura
fenn
why
what
the
matter
see
it
makes
a
man
turn
pale
to
hear
how
a
woman
can
die
fill
the
glasses
john
why
you
as
bad
it
give
me
a
turn
my
lady
pleaded
john
and
the
man
hand
was
unsteady
as
he
poured
out
the
wine
you
ought
not
to
listen
go
and
drink
some
brandy
john
footman
went
from
the
room
my
brave
dick
richard
what
a
face
you
got
he
showed
a
deep
frown
on
a
colourless
face
ca
you
bear
to
hear
of
blood
you
know
it
was
only
one
naughty
woman
out
of
the
world
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
did
refuse
to
give
her
decent
burial
we
christians
hurrah
she
cheered
and
laughed
a
lurid
splendour
glanced
about
her
like
lights
from
the
pit
pledge
me
dick
drink
and
recover
yourself
who
minds
we
must
all
die
the
good
and
the
bad
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
and
wine
for
living
lips
that
poetry
almost
sentiment
we
never
say
die
till
we
drunk
our
fill
not
bad
eh
a
little
vulgar
perhaps
by
jove
do
you
think
me
horrid
where
the
wine
richard
shouted
he
drank
a
couple
of
glasses
in
succession
and
stared
about
was
he
in
hell
with
a
lost
soul
raving
to
him
nobly
spoken
and
nobly
acted
upon
my
brave
dick
now
we
be
companions
she
wished
that
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
ah
dick
dick
too
late
too
late
softly
fell
her
voice
her
eyes
threw
slanting
beams
do
you
see
this
she
pointed
to
a
symbolic
golden
anchor
studded
with
gems
and
coiled
with
a
rope
of
hair
in
her
bosom
it
was
a
gift
of
his
do
you
know
when
i
stole
the
lock
foolish
dick
you
gave
me
an
anchor
without
a
rope
come
and
see
she
rose
from
the
table
and
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
do
you
recognize
your
own
hair
i
should
know
a
thread
of
mine
among
a
million
something
of
the
strength
of
samson
went
out
of
him
as
he
inspected
his
hair
on
the
bosom
of
delilah
and
you
knew
nothing
of
it
you
hardly
know
it
now
you
see
it
what
could
a
woman
steal
from
you
but
you
not
vain
and
that
a
protection
you
a
miracle
dick
a
man
that
not
vain
sit
here
she
curled
up
her
feet
to
give
him
place
on
the
sofa
now
let
us
talk
like
friends
that
part
to
meet
no
more
you
found
a
ship
with
fever
on
board
and
you
were
afraid
to
come
alongside
and
keep
her
company
the
fever
is
catching
you
see
let
us
mingle
our
tears
together
ha
ha
a
man
said
that
once
to
me
the
hypocrite
wanted
to
catch
the
fever
but
he
was
too
old
how
old
are
you
dick
richard
pushed
a
few
months
forward

just
look

you
blooming
boy

me
my
age
adonis
twenty
what
richard
had
given
the
lady
years
she
laughed
violently

do
pay
compliments
dick
best
to
be
honest
guess
again
you
do
like
to
not
or
four
or
or
see
how
he
begins
to
stare
just

dear

think

birthday

in
next
month

at
me

i
a
wrinkle
and
when

i
commence
for
to
live
at
the
ripe
age
of
sixteen
i
saw
a
nobleman
in
despair
because
of
my
beauty
he
vowed
die
i
did
want
him
to
do
that
so
to
save
the
poor
man
for
his
family
i
ran
away
with
him
and
i
dare
say
they
did
appreciate
the
sacrifice
and
he
soon
forgot
to
if
he
ever
did
it
the
way
of
the
world
richard
seized
some
dead
champagne
emptied
the
bottle
into
a
tumbler
and
drank
it
off
john
footman
entered
to
clear
the
table
and
they
were
left
without
further
interruption
bella
bella
richard
uttered
in
a
deep
sad
voice
as
he
walked
the
room
she
leaned
on
her
arm
her
hair
crushed
against
a
reddened
cheek
her
eyes
and
dreamy
bella
he
dropped
beside
her
you
are
unhappy
she
blinked
and
yawned
as
one
who
is
awakened
suddenly
i
think
you
spoke
said
she
you
are
unhappy
bella
you
ca
conceal
it
your
laugh
sounds
like
madness
you
must
be
unhappy
so
young
too
only
what
does
it
matter
who
cares
for
me
the
mighty
pity
falling
from
his
eyes
took
in
her
whole
shape
she
did
not
mistake
it
for
tenderness
as
another
would
have
done
who
cares
for
you
bella
i
do
what
makes
my
misery
now
but
to
see
you
there
and
know
of
no
way
of
helping
you
father
of
mercy
it
seems
too
much
to
have
to
stand
by
powerless
while
such
ruin
is
going
on
her
hand
was
shaken
in
his
by
the
passion
of
torment
with
which
his
frame
quaked
involuntarily
a
tear
started
between
her
eyelids
she
glanced
up
at
him
quickly
then
looked
down
drew
her
hand
from
his
and
smoothed
it
eying
it
bella
you
have
a
father
alive
a
linendraper
dear
he
wears
a
white
this
article
of
apparel
instantaneously
changed
the
tone
of
the
conversation
for
he
rising
abruptly
nearly
squashed
the
lady
dog
whose
squeaks
and
howls
were
piteous
and
demanded
the
most
fervent
caresses
of
its
mistress
it
was
oh
my
poor
pet
mumpsy
and
he
like
a
nasty
great
big
ugly
heavy
foot
an
his
poor
soft
silky
mum
mum
back
he
did
and
he
sood
that
he
mum
mum
sood
and
he
cried
out
and
knew
the
place
to
come
to
and
was
oh
so
sorry
for
what
had
happened
to
him
mum
mum
mum
and
now
he
was
going
to
be
made
happy
his
mistress
make
him
happy
mum
mum
mum
yes
said
richard
savagely
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
you
care
for
the
happiness
of
your
dog
a
course
se
does
mumpsy
was
simperingly
assured
in
the
thick
of
his
silky
flanks
richard
looked
for
his
hat
mumpsy
was
deposited
on
the
sofa
in
a
twinkling
now
said
the
lady
you
must
come
and
beg
mumpsy
pardon
whether
you
meant
to
do
it
or
no
because
little
doggies
ca
tell
that
how
should
they
and
there
poor
mumpsy
thinking
you
a
great
terrible
rival
that
tries
to
squash
him
all
flat
to
nothing
on
purpose
pretending
you
did
see
and
he
trembling
poor
dear
wee
pet
and
i
may
love
my
dog
sir
if
i
like
and
i
do
and
i
wo
have
him
for
never
been
jealous
of
you
and
he
is
a
darling
ten
times
truer
than
men
and
i
love
him
fifty
times
better
so
come
to
him
with
me
first
a
smile
changed
richard
face
then
laughing
a
melancholy
laugh
he
surrendered
to
her
humour
and
went
through
the
form
of
begging
mumpsy
pardon
the
dear
dog
i
do
believe
he
saw
we
were
getting
dull
said
she
and
immolated
himself
intentionally
noble
animal
well
we
act
as
if
we
thought
so
let
us
be
gay
richard
and
not
part
like
ancient
fogies
where
your
fun
you
can
rattle
why
you
you
have
seen
me
in
one
of
my
characters
not
sir
julius
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
she
ran
out
a
white
visage
reappeared
behind
a
spring
of
flame
her
black
hair
was
scattered
over
her
shoulders
and
fell
half
across
her
brows
she
moved
slowly
and
came
up
to
him
fastening
weird
eyes
on
him
pointing
a
finger
at
the
region
of
witches
sepulchral
cadences
accompanied
the
representation
he
did
not
listen
for
he
was
thinking
what
a
deadly
charming
and
exquisitely
horrid
witch
she
was
something
in
the
way
her
underlids
worked
seemed
to
remind
him
of
a
forgotten
picture
but
a
veil
hung
on
the
picture
there
could
be
no
analogy
for
this
was
beautiful
and
devilish
and
that
if
he
remembered
rightly
had
the
beauty
of
seraphs
his
reflections
and
her
performance
were
stayed
by
a
shriek
the
spirits
of
wine
had
run
over
the
plate
she
held
to
the
floor
she
had
the
coolness
to
put
the
plate
down
on
the
table
while
he
stamped
out
the
flame
on
the
carpet
again
she
shrieked
she
thought
she
was
on
fire
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
clasped
her
skirts
all
round
drawing
his
arms
down
them
several
times
still
kneeling
he
looked
up
and
asked
do
you
feel
safe
now
she
bent
her
face
glaring
down
till
the
ends
of
her
hair
touched
his
cheek
said
she
do
you
was
she
a
witch
verily
there
was
sorcery
in
her
breath
sorcery
in
her
hair
the
ends
of
it
stung
him
like
little
snakes
how
do
i
do
it
dick
she
flung
back
laughing
like
you
do
everything
bella
he
said
and
took
breath
there
i
wo
be
a
witch
i
wo
be
a
witch
they
may
burn
me
to
a
cinder
but
i
wo
be
a
witch
she
sang
throwing
her
hair
about
and
stamping
her
feet
i
suppose
i
look
a
figure
i
must
go
and
tidy
myself
no
do
change
i
like
to
see
you
so
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
mixture
of
wonder
and
admiration
i
ca
think
you
the
same
person
not
even
when
you
laugh
richard
her
tone
was
serious
you
were
going
to
speak
to
me
of
my
parents
how
wild
and
awful
you
looked
bella
my
father
richard
was
a
very
respectable
man
bella
you
haunt
me
like
a
ghost
my
mother
died
in
my
infancy
richard
do
put
up
your
hair
bella
i
was
an
only
child
her
head
shook
sorrowfully
at
the
glistening
he
followed
the
abstracted
intentness
of
her
look
and
came
upon
her
words
ah
yes
speak
of
your
father
bella
speak
of
him
shall
i
haunt
you
and
come
to
your
bedside
and
cry

bella
if
you
will
tell
me
where
he
lives

will
go
to
him

forgive
you
if

save
you
so

dishevelled

you
you
naughty
boy
ha
ha
and
away
she
burst
from
him
and
up
flew
her
hair
as
she
danced
across
the
room
and
fell
at
full
length
on
the
sofa
he
felt
giddy
bewitched
we
talk
of
everyday
things
dick
she
called
to
him
from
the
sofa
it
our
last
evening
our
last
heigho
it
makes
me
sentimental
how
that
ripson
pipson
nipson
it
not
complimentary
but
i
ca
remember
names
of
that
sort
why
do
you
have
friends
of
that
sort
he
not
a
gentleman
better
is
he
well
he
rather
too
insignificant
for
me
why
do
you
sit
off
there
come
to
me
instantly
there
sit
up
and
be
proper
and
you
have
plenty
of
room
talk
dick
he
was
reflecting
on
the
fact
that
her
eyes
were
brown
they
had
a
haughty
sparkle
when
she
pleased
and
when
she
pleased
a
soft
languor
circled
them
excitement
had
dyed
her
cheeks
deep
red
he
was
a
youth
and
she
an
enchantress
he
a
hero
she
a
female
the
eyes
were
languid
now
set
in
rosy
colour
you
will
not
leave
me
yet
richard
not
yet
he
had
no
thought
of
departing
it
our
last
night
i
suppose
it
our
last
hour
together
in
this
world
and
i
do
want
to
meet
you
in
the
next
for
poor
dick
will
have
to
come
to
such
a
very
very
disagreeable
place
to
make
the
visit
he
grasped
her
hand
at
this
yes
he
will
too
true
ca
be
helped
they
say
i
handsome

lovely
bella
she
drank
in
his
homage
well
we
admit
it
his
highness
below
likes
lovely
women
i
hear
say
a
gentleman
of
taste
you
do
know
all
my
accomplishments
yet
richard
i
sha
be
astonished
at
anything
new
bella
then
hear
and
wonder
her
voice
trolled
out
some
lively
roulades
do
you
think
he
make
me
his
prima
donna
below
it
nonsense
to
tell
me
there
no
singing
there
and
the
atmosphere
will
be
favourable
to
the
voice
no
damp
you
know
you
saw
the
piano
why
did
you
ask
me
to
sing
before
i
can
sing
italian
i
had
a
master
who
made
love
to
me
i
forgave
him
because
of
the
men
ca
help

on
a
poor
dears
she
went
to
the
piano
struck
the
notes
and
sang
heart
my
heart
i
think
break
because
i
such
a
rake
i
do
know
any
other
reason
no
i
hate
sentimental
songs
wo
sing
that
a
e
how
ridiculous
those
women
were
coming
home
from
richmond
the
sweet
romance
of
story
clad
thy
moving
form
with
grace
once
the
world
and
all
its
glory
was
but
framework
to
thy
face
ah
too
fair
what
i
remember
might
my
soul
recall
but
no
to
the
winds
this
wretched
ember
of
a
fire
that
falls
so
low
hum
do
much
like
that
accanto
al
fuoco
heigho
i
do
want
to
show
off
dick
or
to
break
down
so
i
wo
try
that
but
for
thee
oh
but
for
thee
i
might
have
been
a
happy
wife
and
nursed
a
baby
on
my
knee
and
never
blushed
to
give
it
life
i
used
to
sing
that
when
i
was
a
girl
sweet
richard
and
did
know
at
all
at
all
what
it
meant
must
sing
that
sort
of
song
in
company
we
oh
so
proper
even
we
i
had
a
husband
what
think
you
i
do
i
make
it
my
business
to
keep
him
a
lover
for
when
a
young
gentleman
ceases
to
woo
some
other
amusement
he
quickly
discover
for
such
are
young
gentlemen
made

after
this
trifling
she
sang
a
spanish
ballad

was
in
the
mood
when
imagination
intensely
vivifies
everything
mere
suggestions
of
music
sufficed
the
lady
in
the
ballad
had
been
wronged
lo
it
was
the
lady
before
him
and
soft
horns
blew
he
smelt
the
languid
he
saw
the
stars
crowd
large
and
close
above
the
arid
plain
this
lady
leaning
at
her
window
desolate
pouring
out
her
abandoned
heart
heroes
know
little
what
they
owe
to
champagne
the
lady
wandered
to
venice
thither
he
followed
her
at
a
leap
in
venice
she
was
not
happy
he
was
prepared
for
the
misery
of
any
woman
anywhere
but
oh
to
be
with
her
to
glide
with
through
throbbing
street
past
houses
muffled
in
shadow
and
gloomy
legends
under
storied
bridges
past
palaces
charged
with
full
life
in
dead
quietness
past
grand
old
towers
colossal
squares
gleaming
quays
and
out
and
on
with
her
on
into
the
silver
infinity
shaking
over
seas
was
it
the
champagne
the
music
or
the
poetry
something
of
the
two
former
perhaps
but
most
the
enchantress
playing
upon
him
how
many
instruments
can
not
clever
women
play
upon
at
the
same
moment
and
this
enchantress
was
not
too
clever
or
he
might
have
felt
her
touch
she
was
no
longer
absolutely
bent
on
winning
him
or
he
might
have
seen
a
manoeuvre
she
liked
him
liked
none
better
she
wished
him
well
her
pique
was
satisfied
still
he
was
handsome
and
he
was
going
what
she
liked
him
for
she
rather
very
slightly
wished
to
do
away
with
or
see
if
it
could
be
done
away
with
just
as
one
wishes
to
catch
a
pretty
butterfly
without
hurting
its
patterned
wings
no
harm
intended
to
the
innocent
insect
only
one
wants
to
inspect
it
thoroughly
and
enjoy
the
marvel
of
it
in
one
tender
possession
and
have
the
felicity
of
thinking
one
could
crush
it
if
one
would
he

her
what
she
was
this
lady
in
seville
or
in
venice
the
spot
was
on
her
sailing
the
pathways
of
the
moon
it
was
not
celestial
light
that
illumined
her
beauty
her
sin
was
there
but
in
dreaming
to
save
he
was
soft
to
her
sin
drowned
it
in
deep
mournfulness
silence
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
awoke
him
from
his
musing
she
swam
to
the
sofa
she
was
at
his
feet
i
have
been
light
and
careless
richard
of
course
i
meant
it
i
must
be
happy
with
my
best
friend
going

in
richard
now
at
those
words
as
he
looked
down
on
her
haggard
loveliness
not
divine
sorrow
but
a
devouring
jealousy
sprang
like
fire
in
his
breast
and
set
him
rocking
with
horrid
pain
he
bent
closer
to
her
pale
beseeching
face
her
eyes
still
drew
him
down
bella
no
no
promise
me
swear
it
lost
richard
lost
for
ever
give
me
up
he
cried
i
never
will
and
strained
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
on
the
lips
she
was
not
acting
now
as
she
sidled
and
slunk
her
head
with
a
kind
of
maiden
