one
of
the
secrets
of
the
immense
power
exercised
by
the
novels
of
vicente
blasco
ibáñez
is
that
they
are
literary
projections
of
his
dynamic
personality
not
only
the
style
but
the
book
is
here
the
man
this
is
especially
true
of
those
of
his
works
in
which
the
thesis
element
predominates
and
in
which
the
famous
author
of
four
horsemen
of
the
appears
as
a
novelist
of
it
is
of
course
possible
to
divide
his
works
into
the
manners
or
periods
so
dear
to
the
literary
cataloguers
and
it
may
thus
be
indicated
that
there
are
such
fairly
distinct
genres
as
the
regional
novel
the
sociological
tale
and
the
psychological
study
a
convenient
classification
of
this
sort
would
place
among
the
regional
novels
such
masterpieces
as
and
y
among
the
novels
of
purpose
such
powerful
writings
as
and
y
among
the
psychological
studies
the
introspective
maja
the
war
novels
including
four
and
the
epic
would
seem
to
form
another
group
such
diversions
as
grouping
and
regrouping
however
had
perhaps
best
be
left
to
those
who
relish
the
task
it
is
for
the
present
more
important
to
note
that
the
passionate
flame
of
a
deeply
human
purpose
welds
the
literary
labors
into
a
larger
unity
his
pen
as
his
person
has
been
given
over
to
humanity
he
is
as
fearless
in
his
denunciation
of
evil
as
he
is
powerful
in
his
description
of
it
he
has
lived
his
ideas
as
well
as
fashioned
them
into
enduring
documents
he
reveals
not
only
a
new
spain
but
a
new
world
while
blasco
ibáñez
does
not
desire
to
be
known
as
regional
novelist
nor
does
a
complete
view
of
his
numerous
works
justify
such
a
narrow
description
he
has
nevertheless
in
his
earlier
books
made
such
effective
and
artistic
use
of
regional
backgrounds
that
some
critics
have
found
this
part
of
his
production
best
speaking
from
the
standpoint
of
durable
literary
art
i
am
inclined
to
such
a
view
yet
is
there
less
humanitarian
impulse
in
four
than
in
these
earlier
masterpieces
whether
blasco
ibáñez
background
is
a
corner
in
valencia
a
spot
on
the
island
of
majorca
a
battlefield
in
france
or
our
sea
the
mediterranean
the
cradle
of
civilization
his
real
stage
is
the
human
heart
and
his
real
actor
man
upon
his
election
to
the
cortes
spain
national
parliamentary
assembly
blasco
ibáñez
naturally
turned
in
his
novels
to
a
consideration
of
political
and
social
themes
beginning
with
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
one
of
the
most
powerful
modern
documents
of
its
kind
he
took
up
in
successive
novels
the
treatment
of
such
vital
subjects
as
the
relation
of
church
to
state
the
degrading
and
backward
influence
of
drunkenness
the
problem
of
the
jesuits
the
brutality
and
psychology
of
the
in
all
of
these
works
the
writer
is
characterized
by
fearlessness
passion
and
even
vehemence
yet
his
ardor
is
not
so
strong
as
to
lead
him
into
conscious
unfairness
a
fiery
advocate
of
the
lowly
he
yet
can
cast
their
shortcomings
into
their
teeth
they
in
their
ignorance
are
accomplices
in
their
own
degradation
partners
in
the
crimes
that
oppress
them
they
slay
the
leaders
whom
they
misunderstand
they
are
slow
to
organize
for
the
purpose
of
bursting
their
shackles
this
appears
in
one
of
the
regional
novels
no
less
than
in
and
other
books
of
the
more
purely
sociological
series
in
varying
degree
applied
to
a
nation
rather
than
to
a
class
this
fearless
attitude
is
evident
in
cuatros
jinetes
del
and
in
which
is
assailed
the
neutrality
of
spain
during
the
late
and
unlamented
conflict
this
unflinching
determination
to
see
the
truth
and
state
it
is
also
discernible
in
a
most
personal
manner
the
sad
inability
of
such
noble
spirits
as
gabriel
luna
or
fernando
salvatierra
to
solace
themselves
with
a
belief
in
future
life
is
perhaps
an
exteriorization
of
the
author
own
views
even
as
these
revolutionary
spirits
are
in
part
embodiments
of
himself
in
the
bulk
of
the
noted
spaniard
books
there
is
waged
on
both
a
large
scale
and
a
small
the
ceaseless
implacable
struggle
of
the
new
against
the
old
this
eternal
battle
early
formed
an
appreciable
part
of
even
the
writer
short
fiction
his
old
seamen
look
with
scorn
upon
the
that
replace
their
beloved
barks
his
vintners
regret
the
passing
of
the
good
old
days
when
sherry
sold
high
and
had
not
yet
been
ousted
from
the
market
by
cheap
concoctions
his
toilers
begin
to
rebel
against
ecclesiastical
authority
some
of
his
heroes
are
even
capable
of
falling
in
love
with
jewesses
or
with
women
below
their
station
muertos
everywhere
is
the
fermentation
of
transition
his
protagonists
vigorous
determined
usually
fail
at
the
end
but
if
there
are
victories
that
spell
failure
so
are
there
failures
that
spell
victory
it
is
the
clash
of
these
ancient
and
modern
forces
that
strikes
the
spark
which
ignites
the
author
passion
he
is
with
the
new
and
of
it
yet
rises
above
blind
partisanship
his
dominant
figures
chiefly
men
are
representative
of
the
spain
of
not
that
mañana
which
has
so
long
and
often
unjustly
been
a
standing
reproach
to
iberian
procrastination
but
a
of
rebirth
of
rededication
to
lofty
ideals
and
glowing
realities
in
y
and
written
in
blasco
ibáñez
attacks
the
spanish
national
sport
with
characteristic
thoroughness
approaching
his
subject
from
the
psychological
the
historical
the
national
the
humane
the
dramatic
and
narrative
standpoint
he
evolves
another
of
his
notable
documents
worthy
of
a
place
among
the
great
tracts
of
literary
history
his
process
like
his
plot
is
simple
whether
attacking
the
church
or
the
evils
of
drink
or
the
bloodlust
of
the
bull
ring
his
methods
are
usually
the
same
he
provides
a
protagonist
who
shall
serve
as
the
vehicle
or
symbol
of
his
ideas
surrounding
him
with
minor
personages
intended
to
serve
as
a
foil
or
as
a
prop
he
fills
in
the
background
with
all
the
wealth
of
descriptive
and
coloring
powers
at
his
command
and
these
powers
are
as
highly
developed
in
ibáñez
i
believe
as
in
any
living
writer
the
beauty
of
blasco
ibáñez
descriptions
a
beauty
by
no
means
confined
to
the
pictures
he
summons
to
the
mind
is
that
at
their
best
they
rise
to
interpretation
he
not
only
brings
before
the
eye
a
vivid
image
but
communicates
to
the
spirit
an
intellectual
reaction
here
he
is
the
master
who
penetrates
beyond
the
exterior
into
the
inner
significance
the
reader
is
carried
into
the
swirl
of
the
action
itself
for
the
magic
of
the
author
pen
imparts
a
sense
of
palpitant
actuality
you
are
yourself
a
soldier
at
the
marne
you
fairly
drown
with
ulises
in
his
beloved
mediterranean
you
defend
the
besieged
city
of
saguntum
you
pant
with
the
swordsman
in
the
bloody
arena
this
gift
of
imparting
actuality
to
his
scenes
is
but
another
evidence
of
the
spaniard
dynamic
personality
he
lives
his
actions
so
thoroughly
that
we
live
them
with
him
his
gift
of
second
sight
gives
us
to
see
beyond
amphitheatres
of
blood
and
sand
into
national
character
beyond
a
village
struggle
into
the
vexed
problem
of
land
labor
and
property
against
this
type
of
background
develops
the
characteristic
ibáñez
plot
by
no
means
lacking
intimate
interest
yet
beginning
somewhat
slowly
and
gathering
the
irresistible
momentum
of
a
powerful
body
juan
gallardo
the
hero
of
and
has
from
earliest
childhood
exhibited
a
natural
aptitude
for
the
bull
ring
he
is
aided
in
his
career
by
interested
parties
and
soon
jumps
to
the
forefront
of
his
idolized
profession
without
having
to
thread
his
way
arduously
up
the
steep
ascent
of
the
bull
fighters
hierarchy
fame
and
fortune
come
to
him
and
he
is
able
to
gratify
the
desires
of
his
early
days
as
if
the
mirage
of
hunger
and
desire
had
suddenly
been
converted
into
dazzling
reality
he
lavishes
largess
upon
his
mother
and
his
childless
wife
and
there
comes
too
a
love
out
of
wedlock
but
neither
his
powers
nor
his
fame
can
last
forever
the
life
of
even
juan
gallardo
is
taken
into
his
hands
every
time
he
steps
into
the
ring
to
face
the
wild
bulls
at
first
comes
a
minor
accident
then
a
loss
of
prestige
and
at
last
the
fatal
day
upon
which
he
is
carried
out
of
the
arena
dead
he
dies
a
victim
of
his
own
glory
a
sacrifice
upon
the
altar
of
national
that
doña
sol
who
lures
him
from
his
wife
and
home
is
in
her
capricious
fascinating
baffling
way
almost
a
symbol
of
the
fickle
audience
now
hymning
the
praises
of
a
favorite
now
sneering
him
off
the
scene
of
his
former
triumphs
the
tale
is
more
than
a
colorful
absorbing
story
of
love
and
struggle
it
is
a
stinging
indictment
brought
against
the
author
countrymen
thrown
in
their
faces
with
dauntless
acrimony
he
shows
us
the
glory
of
the
arena
the
movement
the
color
the
mastery
of
the
skilled
performers
and
he
reveals
too
the
sickening
other
side
in
successive
pictures
he
mirrors
the
thousands
that
flock
to
the
bull
fights
reaching
a
tremendous
climax
in
the
closing
words
of
the
tale
the
popular
hero
has
just
been
gored
to
death
but
the
crowd
knowing
that
the
spectacle
is
less
than
half
over
sets
up
yells
for
the
continuance
of
the
performance
in
the
bellowing
of
the
mob
blasco
ibáñez
divines
the
howl
of
the
real
and
only
animals
not
the
sacrificial
bulls
but
the
howling
bloodthirsty
assembly
is
the
genuine
beast
the
volume
is
rich
in
significant
detail
both
as
regards
the
peculiar
powers
and
his
views
as
expressed
in
other
words
once
again
we
meet
the
author
determination
to
be
just
to
all
concerned
through
ruiz
for
example
a
medical
enthusiast
over
tauromachy
we
receive
what
amounts
to
a
lecture
upon
the
evolution
of
the
brutal
sport
he
looks
upon
as
the
historical
substitute
for
the
inquisition
which
was
in
itself
a
great
national
festival
he
is
ready
to
admit
too
that
the
bull
fight
is
a
barbarous
institution
but
calls
to
your
attention
that
it
is
by
no
means
the
only
one
in
the
world
in
the
turning
of
the
people
to
violent
savage
forms
of
amusement
he
beholds
a
universal
ailment
and
when
ruiz
expresses
his
disgust
at
seeing
foreigners
turn
eyes
of
contempt
upon
spain
because
of
the
he
no
doubt
speaks
for
blasco
ibáñez
the
enthusiastic
physician
points
out
that
is
more
cruel
than
and
kills
many
more
men
that
the
spectacle
of
with
trained
dogs
is
hardly
a
sight
for
civilized
onlookers
that
there
is
more
than
one
modern
game
out
of
which
the
participants
emerge
with
broken
legs
fractured
skulls
flattened
noses
and
what
not
and
how
about
the
duel
often
fought
with
only
an
unhealthy
desire
for
publicity
as
the
genuine
cause
thus
through
the
doctor
the
spaniard
states
the
other
side
of
the
case
saying
in
effect
to
the
foreign
reader
yes
i
am
upbraiding
my
countrymen
for
the
national
vice
that
they
are
pleased
to
call
a
sport
that
is
my
right
as
a
spaniard
who
loves
his
country
and
as
a
human
being
who
loves
his
race
but
do
not
forget
that
you
have
institutions
little
less
barbarous
and
before
you
grow
too
excited
in
your
desire
to
remove
the
mote
from
our
eye
see
to
it
that
you
remove
your
own
for
it
is
there
juan
gallardo
is
not
one
of
the
impossible
heroes
that
crowd
the
pages
of
fiction
to
me
he
is
a
more
successful
portrait
than
for
example
gabriel
luna
of
shadow
of
the
there
is
a
certain
rigidity
in
luna
due
perhaps
to
his
unbending
certainty
in
matters
of
belief
or
to
be
exact
matters
of
unbelief
this
is
felt
even
in
his
moments
of
love
although
that
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
vicissitudes
of
his
wandering
existence
and
the
illness
with
which
it
has
left
him
gallardo
is
somehow
more
human
he
is
not
a
matinée
hero
he
knows
what
it
is
to
quake
with
fear
before
he
enters
the
ring
he
comes
to
a
realization
of
what
his
position
has
cost
him
he
impresses
us
not
only
as
a
powerful
type
but
as
a
flesh
and
blood
creature
and
his
end
like
that
of
so
many
of
the
author
protagonists
comes
about
much
in
the
nature
of
a
retribution
he
dies
at
the
hands
of
the
thing
he
loves
on
the
stage
of
his
triumphs
and
while
i
am
on
the
subject
of
the
hero
death
let
me
suggest
that
blasco
ibáñez
numerous
death
scenes
often
attain
a
rare
height
of
artistry
and
poetry
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
some
there
is
a
poet
hidden
in
the
noted
spaniard
a
poet
of
vast
conception
of
deep
communion
with
the
interplay
of
nature
and
her
creatures
of
vision
that
becomes
symbolic
recall
the
death
of
the
centaur
madariaga
in
four
horsemen
of
the
dashing
upon
his
beloved
steed
like
a
mazeppa
of
the
south
american
plains
straight
into
eternity
read
the
remarkable
passages
portraying
the
deaths
of
triton
and
ulises
in
consider
the
deeply
underlying
connotation
of
gabriel
luna
fate
these
are
not
mere
dyings
they
are
apotheoses
doña
sol
belongs
to
the
author
siren
types
she
is
an
early
sister
of
freya
the
german
spy
who
leads
to
the
undoing
of
ulises
in
she
is
one
of
the
many
proofs
that
blasco
ibáñez
in
his
portrayals
of
the
worldly
woman
seizes
upon
typical
rather
than
individual
traits
she
puzzles
the
reader
quite
as
much
as
she
confuses
her
passionate
lover
and
she
is
no
more
loyal
to
him
than
is
the
worshipping
crowd
that
at
last
in
her
presence
dethrones
its
former
idol
among
the
secondary
characters
as
interesting
as
any
is
the
friend
of
juan
who
is
nicknamed
nacional
because
of
his
radical
political
notions
nacional
does
not
drink
wine
to
him
wine
was
responsible
for
the
failure
of
the
a
point
of
view
which
the
author
had
already
enunciated
three
years
earlier
in
similar
to
the
rôle
played
by
drink
is
that
of
illiteracy
and
here
too
nacional
feels
the
terrible
burdens
imposed
upon
the
common
people
by
lack
of
education
indicative
of
the
author
sympathies
is
also
his
strange
bandit
plumitas
a
sort
of
robin
hood
who
robs
from
the
rich
and
succors
the
poor
the
humorous
figure
of
the
suggests
the
horde
of
sycophants
that
always
manage
to
attach
themselves
to
a
noted
and
generous
public
personage
the
dominant
impression
that
the
book
leaves
upon
me
is
one
of
power
crushing
implacable
power
the
author
paragraphs
and
chapters
often
seem
hewn
out
of
rock
and
solidly
massed
one
upon
the
other
in
the
rearing
of
an
impregnable
structure
and
just
as
these
chapters
are
massed
into
a
temple
of
passionate
protest
so
the
entire
works
of
blasco
ibáñez
attain
an
architectural
unity
in
which
not
the
least
of
the
elements
are
a
flaming
nobility
of
purpose
and
a
powerful
directness
of
aim
once
upon
a
time
and
it
was
not
so
very
long
ago
it
was
the
fashion
in
certain
quarters
to
regard
blasco
ibáñez
as
impossible
and
utopian
the
trend
of
world
events
has
greatly
modified
the
meanings
of
some
of
our
words
and
has
given
us
a
deeper
insight
into
hitherto
neglected
aspects
of
foreign
and
domestic
life
things
have
been
happening
lately
in
spain
as
well
as
elsewhere
indeed
that
reveal
our
author
in
somewhat
the
light
of
a
prophet
or
is
it
merely
that
he
is
closer
to
the
heart
of
his
nation
and
describes
what
he
sees
rather
than
draws
a
veil
of
words
before
unpleasant
situations
ultimately
these

breakfasted
early
as
was
his
custom
on
the
days
of
a
a
little
roast
meat
was
his
only
dish
wine
he
did
not
touch
and
the
bottle
remained
unopened
before
him
he
had
to
keep
himself
steady
he
drank
two
cups
of
strong
black
coffee
and
then
lighting
an
enormous
cigar
sat
with
his
elbows
resting
on
the
table
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
watching
with
drowsy
eyes
the
customers
who
little
by
little
began
to
fill
the
for
many
years
past
ever
since
he
had
been
given
la
alternativa
in
the
of
madrid
he
had
always
lodged
at
that
same
hotel
in
the
calle
de
alcala
where
the
proprietors
treated
him
as
one
of
the
family
and
waiters
porters
kitchen
scullions
and
old
chambermaids
all
adored
him
as
the
glory
of
the
establishment
there
also
had
he
stayed
many
days
swathed
in
bandages
in
a
dense
atmosphere
of
iodoform
and
cigar
smoke
as
the
result
of
two
bad
gorings
but
these
evil
memories
had
not
made
much
impression
with
his
southern
superstition
and
continual
exposure
to
danger
he
had
come
to
believe
that
this
hotel
was
a
buena
sombra
and
that
whilst
staying
there
no
harm
would
happen
to
him
the
risks
of
his
profession
he
had
to
take
a
tear
in
his
clothes
perhaps
or
even
a
gash
in
his
flesh
but
nothing
to
make
him
fall
for
ever
as
so
many
of
his
comrades
had
fallen
the
recollection
of
these
tragedies
disturbed
his
happiest
hours
on
these
days
after
his
early
breakfast
he
enjoyed
sitting
in
the
watching
the
movements
of
the
travellers
foreigners
or
people
from
distant
provinces
who
passed
him
by
with
uninterested
faces
and
without
a
glance
but
who
turned
with
curiosity
on
hearing
from
the
servants
that
the
handsome
young
fellow
with
face
and
black
eyes
dressed
like
a
gentleman
was
juan
gallardo
the
famous
matador
called
familiarly
by
everybody
el
gallardo
in
this
atmosphere
of
curiosity
he
whiled
away
the
wearisome
wait
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
plaza
how
long
the
time
seemed
those
hours
of
uncertainty
in
which
vague
fears
rose
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
making
him
doubtful
of
himself
were
the
most
painful
in
his
profession
he
did
not
care
to
go
out
into
the
street
he
thought
of
the
fatigues
of
the
corrida
and
the
necessity
of
keeping
himself
fresh
and
agile
nor
could
he
amuse
himself
with
the
pleasures
of
the
table
on
account
of
the
necessity
of
eating
little
and
early
so
as
to
arrive
in
the
plaza
free
from
the
heaviness
of
digestion
he
remained
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
face
resting
on
his
hands
and
a
cloud
of
perfumed
smoke
before
his
eyes
which
he
turned
from
time
to
time
with
a
air
in
the
direction
of
some
ladies
who
were
watching
the
famous
torero
with
marked
interest
his
vanity
as
an
idol
of
the
populace
made
him
read
praises
and
flatteries
in
those
glances
they
evidently
thought
him
spruce
and
elegant
and
he
forgetting
his
anxieties
with
the
instinct
of
a
man
accustomed
to
adopt
a
proud
bearing
before
the
public
drew
himself
up
dusted
the
ashes
of
his
cigar
from
his
coat
sleeves
with
a
flick
and
adjusted
the
ring
which
set
with
an
enormous
brilliant
covered
the
whole
joint
of
one
finger
and
from
which
flashed
a
perfect
rainbow
of
colours
as
if
its
depths
clear
as
a
drop
of
water
were
burning
with
magic
fires
his
eyes
travelled
complaisantly
over
his
own
person
admiring
his
suit
the
cap
which
he
usually
wore
about
the
hotel
now
thrown
on
a
chair
close
by
the
fine
gold
chain
which
crossed
the
upper
part
of
his
waistcoat
from
pocket
to
pocket
the
pearl
in
his
cravat
which
seemed
to
light
up
the
swarthy
colour
of
his
face
with
its
milky
light
and
his
russia
leather
shoes
which
showed
between
the
instep
and
the
trouser
openwork
embroidered
silk
socks
like
the
stockings
of
a
cocotte
an
atmosphere
of
english
scents
sweet
and
vague
but
used
in
profusion
emanated
from
his
clothes
and
from
the
black
glossy
waves
of
hair
which
he
wore
curled
on
his
temples
and
he
assumed
a
swaggering
air
before
this
feminine
curiosity
for
a
torero
he
was
not
bad
he
felt
satisfied
with
his
appearance
where
would
you
find
a
man
more
distinguished
or
more
attractive
to
women
but
suddenly
his
preoccupation
reappeared
the
fire
of
his
eyes
was
quenched
his
chin
again
sank
on
his
hand
and
he
puffed
hard
at
his
cigar
his
gaze
lost
itself
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
he
thought
with
impatience
of
the
twilight
hours
longing
for
them
to
come
as
soon
as
possible
of
his
return
from
the
hot
and
tired
but
with
the
relief
of
danger
overcome
his
appetites
awakened
a
wild
desire
for
pleasure
and
the
certainty
of
a
few
days
of
safety
and
rest
if
god
still
protected
him
as
he
had
done
so
many
times
before
he
would
dine
with
the
appetite
of
his
former
days
of
want
he
would
drink
his
fill
too
and
would
then
go
in
search
of
a
girl
who
was
singing
in
a
whom
he
had
seen
during
one
of
his
journeys
without
however
having
been
able
to
follow
up
the
acquaintance
in
this
life
of
perpetual
movement
rushing
from
one
end
of
the
peninsula
to
the
other
he
never
had
time
for
anything
several
enthusiastic
friends
who
before
going
to
breakfast
in
their
own
houses
wished
to
see
the
diestro
had
by
this
time
entered
the
they
were
old
amateurs
of
the
anxious
to
form
a
small
coterie
and
to
have
an
idol
they
had
made
the
young
gallardo
their
own
matador
giving
him
sage
advice
and
recalling
at
every
turn
their
old
adoration
for
lagartijo
or
frascuelo
they
spoke
to
the
espada
as
tu
with
patronising
familiarity
and
he
when
he
answered
them
placed
the
respectful
don
before
their
names
with
that
traditional
separation
of
classes
which
exists
between
even
a
torero
risen
from
a
social
substratum
and
his
admirers
these
people
joined
to
their
enthusiasm
their
memories
of
past
times
in
order
to
impress
the
young
diestro
with
the
superiority
of
their
years
and
experience
they
spoke
of
the
old
plaza
of
madrid
where
only
true
toreros
and
true
bulls
were
known
and
drawing
nearer
to
the
present
times
they
trembled
with
excitement
as
they
remembered
the
negro
that
negro
was
frascuelo
if
you
could
only
have
seen
him
but
probably
you
and
those
of
your
day
were
still
at
the
breast
or
were
not
yet
born
other
enthusiasts
kept
coming
into
the
men
of
wretched
appearance
and
hungry
faces
obscure
reporters
of
papers
only
known
to
the
whom
they
honoured
with
their
praise
or
censure
people
of
problematic
profession
who
appeared
as
soon
as
the
news
of
gallardo
arrival
got
about
besieging
him
with
flatteries
and
requests
for
tickets
the
general
enthusiasm
permitted
them
to
mix
with
the
other
gentlemen
rich
merchants
and
public
functionaries
who
discussed
affairs
with
them
hotly
without
being
troubled
by
their
beggarly
appearance
all
of
them
on
seeing
the
espada
embraced
him
or
clasped
his
hand
to
a
running
accompaniment
of
questions
and
exclamations
juanillo

is
carmen
quite
well
thank
you
and
your
mother
the
señora

famous
thanks
she

well
also
as
great
a
talker
as
ever
and
a
little
family
is
there
no
hope
no
not
that
much
and
he
bit
his
nails
in
expressive
negation
he
then
turned
his
enquiries
on
the
stranger
of
whose
life
beyond
his
love
for
he
was
completely
ignorant
and
your
own
family
are
they
also
quite
well
come
along
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
sit
down
and
have
something
next
he
enquired
about
the
looks
of
the
bulls
with
which
he
was
going
to
fight
in
a
few
hours
time
because
all
these
friends
had
just
come
from
the
plaza
after
seeing
the
separation
and
boxing
of
the
animals
and
with
professional
curiosity
he
asked
for
news
from
the
café
ingles
where
many
of
the
amateurs
foregathered
it
was
the
first
corrida
of
the
spring
season
and
enthusiastic
admirers
had
great
hopes
of
him
as
they
called
to
mind
all
the
articles
they
had
read
in
the
papers
describing
his
recent
triumphs
in
other
plazas
in
spain
he
had
more
engagements
than
any
other
torero
since
the
corrida
of
the
feast
of
the
resurrection
the
first
important
event
in
the
taurine
year
gallardo
had
gone
from
place
to
place
killing
bulls
later
on
when
august
and
september
came
round
he
would
have
to
spend
his
nights
in
the
train
and
his
afternoons
in
the
ring
with
scarcely
breathing
time
between
them
his
agent
in
seville
was
nearly
frantic
overwhelmed
with
letters
and
telegrams
and
not
knowing
how
to
fit
so
many
requests
for
engagements
into
the
exigencies
of
time
the
evening
before
this
he
had
fought
at
ciudad
real
and
still
in
his
splendid
dress
had
thrown
himself
into
the
train
in
order
to
arrive
in
madrid
in
the
morning
he
had
spent
a
wakeful
night
only
sleeping
by
snatches
boxed
up
in
the
small
sitting
accommodation
that
the
other
passengers
managed
by
squeezing
themselves
together
to
leave
for
the
man
who
was
to
risk
his
life
on
the
following
day
the
enthusiasts
admired
his
physical
endurance
and
the
daring
courage
with
which
he
threw
himself
on
the
bull
at
the
moment
of
killing
it
let
us
see
what
you
can
do
this
afternoon
they
said
with
the
fervour
of
zealots
the
fraternity
expects
great
things
from
you
you
will
lower
the
mona
of
many
of
our
rivals
let
us
see
you
as
dashing
here
as
you
were
in
seville
his
admirers
dispersed
to
their
breakfasts
at
home
in
order
to
go
early
to
the
corrida
gallardo
finding
himself
alone
was
making
his
way
up
to
his
room
impelled
by
the
nervous
restlessness
which
overpowered
him
when
a
man
holding
two
children
by
the
hand
pushed
open
the
glass
doors
of
the
regardless
of
the
servant
enquiries
as
to
his
business
he
smiled
seraphically
when
he
saw
the
torero
and
advanced
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
dragging
the
children
along
and
scarcely
noticing
where
he
placed
his
feet
gallardo
recognised
him
how
are
you
comparé
then
began
all
the
usual
questions
as
to
the
welfare
of
the
family
after
which
the
man
turned
to
his
children
saying
solemnly
here
he
is
you
are
always
asking
to
see
him
he
exactly
like
his
portraits
is
he
the
two
mites
stared
religiously
at
the
hero
whose
portraits
they
had
so
often
seen
on
the
prints
which
adorned
the
walls
of
their
poor
little
home
a
supernatural
being
whose
exploits
and
wealth
had
been
their
chief
admiration
ever
since
they
had
begun
to
understand
mundane
matters
juanillo
kiss

and
the
younger
of
the
two
rubbed
a
red
cheek
against
the
torero
hand
a
cheek
newly
polished
by
his
mother
in
view
of
this
visit
gallardo
caressed
his
head
abstractedly
this
was
one
of
the
numerous
godchildren
he
had
about
spain
enthusiasts
forced
him
to
stand
godfather
to
their
children
thinking
in
this
way
to
secure
their
future
and
to
have
to
appear
at
baptisms
was
one
of
the
penalties
of
his
fame
this
particular
godson
reminded
him
of
bad
times
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
and
he
felt
grateful
to
the
father
for
the
confidence
he
had
placed
in
him
at
a
time
when
others
were
still
doubtful
of
his
merits
and
how
about
your
business

enquired

is
it
going
on

the
aficionado
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
getting

to
his
dealings
in
the
barley
market
just
getting
a
livelihood
nothing
more
gallardo
looked
compassionately
at
his
threadbare
clothes
would
you
like
to
see
the
corrida
comparé
well
go
up
to
my
room
and
tell
garabato
to
give
you
a
my
dear
fellow
here
a
trifle
to
buy
yourselves
some
little
thing
and
while
the
little
godson
again
kissed
his
right
hand
with
his
other
hand
the
matador
gave
each
child
a
couple
of
duros
the
father
dragged
away
his
offspring
with
many
grateful
excuses
though
he
did
not
succeed
in
making
clear
in
his
very
confused
thanks
whether
his
delight
was
for
the
present
to
the
children
or
for
the
ticket
for
the
which
the
diestro
servant
would
give
him
gallardo
waited
for
some
time
so
as
not
to
meet
his
admirer
and
the
children
in
his
room
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
only
one
what
a
long
time
it
still
was
till
the
as
he
came
out
of
the
and
turned
towards
the
stairs
a
woman
wrapped
in
an
old
cloak
came
out
of
the
office
barring
his
way
with
determined
familiarity
quite
regardless
of
the
expostulations

the
entrance
to
break
through
the
strict
supervision
that
was
usually
maintained
at
the
doors
heedless
of
the
hotel
servants
an
irruption
of
loafers
and
newspaper
sellers
burst
into
the
hall
ragamuffins
with
bundles
of
papers
under
their
arms
flourished
their
caps
and
greeted
gallardo
with
boisterous
familiarity
el
gallardo
olé
el
gallardo
long
live
the
brave
the
more
daring
seized
his
hand
shaking
it
roughly
and
pulling
it
about
in
their
anxiety
to
keep
touch
of
this
national
hero
whose
portraits
they
had
all
seen
in
every
paper
as
long
as
ever
they
could
and
then
to
give
their
companions
a
chance
of
sharing
their
triumph
they
shouted
shake
his
hand
he
wo
be
offended
he
a
real
good
sort
their
devotion
made
them
almost
kneel
before
the
matador
there
were
also
other
admirers
just
as
insistent
with
unkempt
beards
and
clothes
that
had
been
fashionable
in
the
days
of
their
youth
who
shuffled
round
their
idol
in
boots
that
had
seen
better
days
they
swept
their
greasy
sombreros
towards
him
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
called
him
don
juan
in
order
to
emphasise
the
difference
between
themselves
and
the
rest
of
that
irreverent
excited
crowd
some
of
them
drew
attention
to
their
poverty
and
asked
for
a
small
donation
others
with
more
impertinence
asked
in
the
name
of
their
love
of
the
sport
for
a
ticket
for
the
corrida
fully
intending
to
sell
it
immediately
gallardo
defended
himself
laughingly
against
this
avalanche
which
jostled
and
overwhelmed
him
and
from
which
the
hotel
servants
who
were
bewildered
at
the
excitement
aroused
by
his
popularity
were
quite
unable
to
save
him
he
searched
through
all
his
pockets
until
he
finally
turned
them
out
empty
distributing
silver
coins
broadcast
among
the
greedy
hands
held
out
to
clutch
them
there
is
no
more
the
fuel
is
finished
leave
me
alone
my
friends
pretending
to
be
annoyed
by
this
popularity
which
in
fact
flattered
him
greatly
he
suddenly
opened
a
way
through
them
with
his
muscular
athletic
arms
and
ran
upstairs
bounding
up
the
steps
with
the
lightness
of
a
wrestler
while
the
servants
freed
from
the
restraint
of
his
presence
pushed
the
crowd
towards
the
door
and
swept
them
into
the
street
gallardo
passed
the
room
occupied
by
his
servant
garabato
and
saw
him
through
the
half
open
door
busy
amid
trunks
and
boxes
preparing
his
master
clothes
for
the
corrida
on
finding
himself
alone
in
his
own
room
the
happy
excitement
caused
by
the
avalanche
of
admirers
vanished
at
once
the
bad
moments
of
the
days
of
a
corrida
returned
the
anxiety
of
those
last
hours
before
going
to
the
plaza
bulls
of
muira
and
a
madrid
audience
the
danger
which
when
facing
him
seemed
to
intoxicate
him
and
increase
his
daring
was
anguish
to
him
when
alone
something
supernatural
fearful
and
intimidating
from
its
very
uncertainty
he
felt
overwhelmed
as
if
the
fatigues
of
his
previous
bad
night
had
suddenly
overcome
him
he
longed
to
throw
himself
on
one
of
the
beds
which
occupied
the
end
of
the
room
but
again
the
anxiety
which
possessed
him
with
its
mystery
and
uncertainty
banished
the
desire
to
sleep
he
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
lighting
another
havanna
from
the
end
of
the
one
he
had
just
smoked
what
would
be
the
result
for
him
of
the
madrid
season
just
about
to
commence
what
would
his
enemies
say
what
would
his
professional
rivals
do
he
had
killed
many
muira
bulls
after
all
they
were
only
like
any
other
bulls
still
he
thought
of
his
comrades
fallen
in
the
arena
nearly
all
of
them
victims
of
animals
from
this
herd
cursed
muiras
no
wonder
he
and
other
espadas
exacted
a
thousand
pesetas
more
in
their
contracts
each
time
they
fought
with
bulls
of
this
breed
he
wandered
vaguely
about
the
room
with
nervous
step
now
and
then
he
stopped
to
gaze
vacantly
at
well
known
things
amongst
his
luggage
and
finally
he
threw
himself
into
an
as
if
seized
with
a
sudden
weakness
he
looked
often
at
his
watch
not
yet
two
how
slowly
the
time
passed
he
longed
as
a
relief
for
his
nervousness
for
the
time
to
come
as
soon
as
possible
for
him
to
dress
and
go
to
the
plaza
the
people
the
noise
the
general
curiosity
the
desire
to
show
himself
calm
and
at
ease
before
an
admiring
public
and
above
all
the
near
approach
of
danger
real
and
personal
would
instantly
blot
out
this
anguish
of
solitude
in
which
the
espada
with
no
external
excitement
to
assist
him
felt
himself
face
to
face
with
something
very
like
fear
the
necessity
for
distracting
his
mind
made
him
search
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
take
out
of
his
a
letter
which
exhaled
a
strong
sweet
scent
standing
by
a
window
through
which
entered
the
dull
light
of
an
interior
courtyard
he
looked
at
the
envelope
which
had
been
delivered
to
him
on
his
arrival
at
the
hotel
admiring
the
elegance
of
the
handwriting
in
which
the
address
was
written
so
delicate
and
well
shaped
then
he
drew
out
the
letter
inhaling
its
indefinable
perfume
with
delight
ah
these
people
of
high
birth
who
had
travelled
much
how
they
revealed
their
inimitable
breeding
even
in
the
smallest
details
gallardo
as
though
he
still
carried
about
his
person
the
pungent
odour
of
the
poverty
of
his
early
years
perfumed
himself
abundantly
his
enemies
laughed
at
this
athletic
young
fellow
who
by
his
love
of
scent
belied
the
strength
of
his
sex
even
his
admirers
smiled
at
his
weakness
though
often
they
had
to
turn
their
heads
aside
sickened
by
the
diestro
excess
a
whole
perfumer
shop
accompanied
him
on
his
journeys
and
the
most
feminine
scents
anointed
his
body
as
he
went
down
into
the
arena
amongst
the
scattered
entrails
of
dead
horses
and
their
dung
certain
enamoured
cocottes
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
during
a
journey
to
the
plazas
in
the
south
of
france
had
given
him
the
secret
of
combining
and
mixing
rare
perfumes
but
the
scent
of
that
letter
it
was
the
scent
of
the
person
who
had
written
it
that
mysterious
scent
so
delicate
indefinable
and
inimitable
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
her
aristocratic
form
and
which
he
called
the
scent
of
the
lady
he
read
and
the
letter
with
a
beatified
smile
of
delight
and
pride
it
was
not
much
only
half
a
dozen
lines
a
greeting
from
seville
wishing
him
good
luck
in
madrid
congratulations
beforehand
on
his
expected
triumph
the
letter
might
have
been
lost
anywhere
without
compromising
the
woman
who
signed
it
friend
gallardo
it
began
in
a
delicate
handwriting
which
made
the
torero
eyes
brighten
and
it
ended
your
friend
sol
all
in
a
coldly
friendly
style
writing
to
him
as
usté
with
an
amiable
tone
of
superiority
as
though
the
words
were
not
between
equals
but
fell
in
mercy
from
on
high
as
the
torero
looked
at
the
letter
with
the
adoration
of
a
man
of
the
people
little
versed
in
reading
he
could
not
suppress
a
certain
feeling
of
annoyance
as
though
he
felt
himself
despised
that
gachí
he
murmured
what
a
woman
no
one
can
discompose
her
see
how
she
writes
to
me
as
to
me
but
pleasant
memories
made
him
smile
with
that
cold
style
was
for
letters
only
the
ways
of
a
great
lady
the
precautions
of
a
woman
of
the
world
his
annoyance
soon
turned
to
admiration
how
clever
she
is
a
cautious
minx
he
smiled
a
smile
of
professional
satisfaction
the
pride
of
a
tamer
who
enhances
his
own
glory
by
exaggerating
the
strength
of
the
wild
beast
he
has
overcome
while
gallardo
was
admiring
his
letter
his
servant
garabato
passed
in
and
out
of
the
room
laden
with
clothes
and
boxes
which
he
spread
on
a
bed
he
was
very
quiet
in
his
movements
very
deft
of
hand
and
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
the
matador
presence
for
many
years
past
he
had
accompanied
the
diestro
to
all
his
as
sword
carrier
he
had
begun
at
the
capeas
at
the
same
time
as
gallardo
but
all
the
bad
luck
had
been
for
him
and
all
the
advancement
and
fame
for
his
companion
he
was
dark
swarthy
and
of
poor
muscular
development
and
a
jagged
badly
joined
scar
crossed
his
wrinkled
flabby
face
like
a
white
scrawl
it
was
a
goring
he
had
received
in
the
plaza
of
some
town
he
had
visited
and
which
had
nearly
been
his
death
and
besides
this
terrible
wound
there
were
others
which
disfigured
parts
of
his
body
which
could
not
be
seen
by
a
miracle
he
had
emerged
with
his
life
from
his
passion
for
and
the
cruel
part
of
it
was
that
people
used
to
laugh
at
his
misfortunes
and
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
seeing
him
trampled
and
mangled
by
the
bulls
finally
his
obstinacy
yielded
to
misfortune
and
he
decided
to
become
the
attendant
and
confidential
servant
of
his
old
friend
he
was
gallardo
most
fervent
admirer
though
he
sometimes
took
advantage
of
this
confidential
intimacy
to
allow
himself
to
criticise
and
advise
had
he
stood
in
his
master
skin
he
would
have
done
better
under
certain
circumstances
gallardo
friends
found
the
wrecked
ambitions
of
the
sword
carrier
an
unfailing
source
of
merriment
but
he
took
no
notice
of
their
jokes
give
up
bulls
never
so
that
all
memory
of
the
past
should
not
be
effaced
he
combed
his
coarse
hair
in
curls
above
his
ears
and
preserved
on
his
occiput
the
long
sacred
lock
the
of
his
younger
days
the
of
the
profession
which
distinguished
him
from
other
mortals
when
gallardo
was
angry
with
him
his
noisy
impulsive
rage
always
threatened
this
capillary
appendage
you
dare
to
wear
a
shameless
dolt
i
cut
off
that
rat
tail
for
you
confounded
idiot
maleta
garabato
received
these
threats
resignedly
but
he
revenged
himself
by
retiring
into
the
silence
of
a
superior
being
and
only
replying
by
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
to
the
exultation
of
his
master
when
on
returning
from
a
after
a
lucky
afternoon
gallardo
exclaimed
with
almost
childish
vanity
what
did
you
think
of
it
really
was
i
splendid
in
consequence
of
their
early
comradeship
he
always
retained
the
privilege
of
addressing
his
master
as
tu
he
could
not
speak
otherwise
to
the
maestro
but
the
tu
was
accompanied
by
a
grave
face
and
an
expression
of
genuine
respect
his
familiarity
was
something
akin
to
that
of
their
squires
towards
the
knights
errant
of
olden
days
from
his
neck
to
the
top
of
his
head
he
was
a
torero
but
the
rest
of
his
person
seemed
half
tailor
half
valet
dressed
in
a
suit
of
english
cloth
a
present
from
his
master
he
had
the
lapels
of
his
coat
covered
with
pins
and
while
several
threaded
needles
were
fastened
into
one
of
his
sleeves
his
dark
withered
hands
manipulated
and
arranged
things
with
the
gentleness
of
a
woman
when
everything
that
was
necessary
for
his
master
toilet
had
been
placed
upon
the
bed
he
passed
the
numerous
articles
in
review
to
ensure
that
nothing
was
wanting
anywhere
after
a
time
he
came
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
without
looking
at
gallardo
and
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
himself
said
in
a
hoarse
and
rasping
voice
two
gallardo
raised
his
head
nervously
as
if
up
to
now
he
had
not
noticed
his
servant
presence
he
put
the
letter
into
his
and
then
walked
lazily
to
the
end
of
the
room
as
though
he
wished
to
postpone
the
dressing
time
is
everything
there
suddenly
his
pale
face
became
flushed
and
violently
distorted
and
his
eyes
opened
unnaturally
wide
as
if
he
had
just
experienced
some
awful
unexpected
shock
what
clothes
have
you
put
out
garabato
pointed
to
the
bed
but
before
he
could
speak
his
wrath
fell
on
him
loud
and
terrible
curse
you
do
you
know
anything
about
the
profession
have
you
just
come
from
the
cornfields
corrida
in
madrid
bulls
from
muira
and
you
put
me
out
red
clothes
like
those
poor
manuel
el
espartero
wore
you
are
so
idiotic
that
one
would
think
you
were
my
enemy
it
would
seem
that
you
wished
for
my
death
you
villain
the
more
he
thought
of
the
enormity
of
this
carelessness
which
was
equivalent
to
courting
disaster
the
more
his
anger
increased
to
fight
in
madrid
in
red
clothes
after
what
had
happened
his
eyes
sparkled
with
rage
as
if
he
had
just
received
some
treacherous
attack
the
whites
of
his
eyes
became
bloodshot
and
he
seemed
ready
to
fall
on
the
unfortunate
garabato
with
his
big
rough
hands
a
discreet
knock
at
the
door
cut
the
scene
short
come
in
a
young
man
entered
dressed
in
a
light
suit
with
a
red
cravat
carrying
his
cordovan
felt
hat
in
a
hand
covered
with
large
diamond
rings
gallardo
recognised
him
at
once
with
the
facility
for
remembering
faces
acquired
by
those
who
live
constantly
rubbing
shoulders
with
the
crowd
his
anger
was
instantly
transformed
to
a
smiling
amiability
as
if
the
visit
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
him
it
was
a
friend
from
bilbao
an
enthusiastic
aficionado
a
warm
partisan
of
his
triumphs
that
was
all
he
could
remember
about
him
his
name
he
knew
so
many
people
what
he
call
himself
all
he
knew
was
that
most
certainly
he
ought
to
call
him
tu
as
this
was
an
old
acquaintanceship
sit
down
this
is
a
surprise
when
did
you
arrive
are
you
and
yours
quite
well
his
admirer
sat
down
with
the
contentment
of
a
devotee
who
enters
the
sanctuary
of
his
idol
with
no
intention
of
moving
from
it
till
the
very
last
moment
delighted
at
being
addressed
as
tu
by
the
master
and
calling
him
juan
at
every
other
word
so
that
the
furniture
walls
or
anyone
passing
along
the
passage
outside
should
be
aware
of
his
intimacy
with
the
great
man
had
arrived
that
morning
and
was
returning
on
the
following
day
the
journey
was
solely
to
see
gallardo
he
had
read
of
his
exploits
the
season
seemed
opening
well
this
afternoon
would
be
a
good
one
he
had
been
in
the
boxing
enclosure
in
the
morning
and
had
noticed
an
almost
black
animal
which
assuredly
would
give
great
sport
in
gallardo
hands
the
master
hurriedly
cut
short
the
habitué
prophesies
pardon
me
pray
excuse
me
i
will
return
at
once
leaving
the
room
he
went
towards
an
unnumbered
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
what
clothes
shall
i
put
out
enquired
garabato
in
a
voice
more
hoarse
than
usual
from
his
wish
to
appear
submissive
the
green
the
tobacco
the
blue
anything
you
please
and
gallardo
disappeared
through
the
little
door
while
his
servant
freed
from
his
presence
smiled
with
malicious
revenge
he
knew
what
that
sudden
rush
meant
just
at
dressing
time
the
relief
of
fear
they
called
it
in
the
profession
and
his
smile
expressed
satisfaction
to
see
once
more
that
the
greatest
masters
of
the
art
and
the
bravest
suffered
as
the
result
of
their
anxiety
just
the
same
as
he
himself
had
done
when
he
went
down
into
the
arena
in
different
towns
when
gallardo
returned
to
his
room
some
little
time
after
he
found
a
fresh
visitor
this
was
doctor
ruiz
a
popular
physician
who
had
spent
thirty
years
signing
the
bulletins
of
the
various
cogidas
and
attending
every
torero
who
fell
wounded
in
the
plaza
of
madrid
gallardo
admired
him
immensely
regarding
him
as
the
greatest
exponent
of
universal
science
but
at
the
same
time
he
allowed
himself
affectionate
chaff
at
the
expense
of
the
doctor
character
and
personal
untidiness
his
admiration
was
that
of
the
populace
only
recognising
ability
in
a
slovenly
person
if
he
possesses
sufficient
eccentricity
to
distinguish
him
from
the
general
run
he
was
of
low
stature
and
prominent
abdomen
broad
faced
and
with
a
newgate
frill
of
dirty
whitish
yellow
which
gave
him
at
a
distance
a
certain
resemblance
to
a
bust
of
socrates
as
he
stood
up
his
protuberant
and
flabby
stomach
seemed
to
shake
under
his
ample
waistcoat
as
he
spoke
as
he
sat
down
this
same
part
of
his
anatomy
rose
up
to
his
meagre
chest
his
clothes
stained
and
old
after
a
few
use
seemed
to
float
about
his
unharmonious
body
like
garments
belonging
to
someone
else
so
obese
was
he
in
the
parts
devoted
to
digestion
and
so
lean
in
those
of
locomotion
he
is
a
simpleton
said
gallardo
a
learned
man
certainly
as
good
as
bread
but
he
will
never
have
a
peseta
whatever
he
has
he
gives
away
and
he
takes
what
anyone
chooses
to
pay
him
two
great
passions
filled
his
life
the
revolution
and
bulls
that
vague
but
tremendous
revolution
which
would
come
leaving
in
europe
nothing
that
now
existed
an
anarchical
republicanism
that
he
did
not
trouble
to
explain
and
which
was
only
clear
in
its
exterminatory
negations
the
toreros
spoke
to
him
as
a
father
he
called
them
all
tu
and
it
was
sufficient
for
a
telegram
to
come
from
the
furthest
end
of
the
peninsula
for
the
good
doctor
instantly
to
take
the
train
and
rush
to
heal
a
goring
received
by
one
of
his
lads
with
no
expectation
of
any
recompense
beyond
simply
what
they
chose
to
give
him
he
embraced
gallardo
on
seeing
him
after
his
long
absence
pressing
his
flaccid
abdomen
against
that
body
which
seemed
made
of
bronze
oh
you
fine
fellow
he
thought
the
espada
looked
better
than
ever
and
how
about
that
republic
doctor
when
is
it
going
to
come
asked
gallardo
with
andalusian
laziness
el
nacional
says
that
we
are
on
the
verge
and
that
it
will
come
one
of
these
days
what
does
it
matter
to
you
rascal
leave
poor
nacional
in
peace
he
had
far
better
learn
to
be
a
better
banderillero
as
for
you
what
ought
to
interest
you
is
to
go
on
killing
bulls
like
god
himself
we
have
a
fine
little
afternoon
in
prospect
i
am
told
that
the
herd
but
when
he
got
as
far
as
this
the
young
man
who
had
seen
the
selection
and
wished
to
give
news
of
it
interrupted
the
doctor
to
speak
of
the
dark
bull
which
had
struck
his
eye
and
from
which
the
greatest
wonders
might
be
expected
the
two
men
who
after
bowing
to
each
other
had
sat
together
in
the
room
for
a
long
time
in
silence
now
stood
up
face
to
face
and
gallardo
thought
that
an
introduction
was
necessary
but
what
was
he
to
call
the
friend
who
was
addressing
him
as
tu
he
scratched
his
head
frowning
reflectively
but
his
indecision
was
short
listen
here
what
is
your
name
pardon
me
you
understand
i
see
so
many
people
the
youth
smothered
beneath
a
smile
his
disenchantment
at
finding
himself
forgotten
by
the
master
and
gave
his
name
when
he
heard
it
gallardo
felt
all
the
past
recur
suddenly
to
his
memory
and
repaired
his
forgetfulness
by
adding
after
the
name
a
rich
in
bilbao
and
then
presented
the
famous
ruiz
and
the
two
men
united
by
the
enthusiasm
of
a
common
passion
began
to
chat
about
the
herd
just
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
sit
yourselves
down
said
gallardo
pointing
to
a
sofa
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
you
wo
disturb
me
there
talk
and
pay
no
attention
to
me
i
am
going
to
dress
as
we
are
all
men
here
and
he
began
to
take
off
his
clothes
remaining
only
in
his
undergarments
seated
on
a
chair
under
the
arch
which
divided
the
from
the
bedroom
he
gave
himself
over
into
the
hands
of
garabato
who
had
opened
a
russia
leather
bag
from
which
he
had
taken
an
almost
feminine
toilet
case
for
trimming
up
his
master
in
spite
of
his
being
already
carefully
shaved
garabato
soaped
his
face
and
passed
the
razor
over
his
cheeks
with
the
celerity
born
of
daily
practice
after
washing
himself
gallardo
resumed
his
seat
the
servant
then
sprinkled
his
hair
with
brilliantine
and
scent
combing
it
in
curls
over
his
forehead
and
temples
and
then
began
to
dress
the
sign
of
the
profession
the
sacred
with
infinite
care
he
combed
and
plaited
the
long
lock
which
adorned
his
master
occiput
and
then
interrupting
the
operation
fastened
it
on
the
top
of
his
head
with
two
hairpins
leaving
its
final
dressing
for
a
later
stage
next
he
must
attend
to
the
feet
and
he
drew
off
the
fighter
socks
leaving
him
only
his
vest
and
drawers
gallardo
powerful
muscles
stood
out
beneath
these
clothes
in
superb
swellings
a
hollow
in
one
thigh
betrayed
a
place
where
the
flesh
had
disappeared
owing
to
a
gash
from
a
horn
the
swarthy
skin
of
his
arms
was
marked
with
white
wheals
the
scars
of
ancient
wounds
his
dark
hairless
chest
was
crossed
by
two
irregular
purple
lines
record
also
of
bloody
feats
on
one
of
his
heels
the
flesh
was
of
a
violet
colour
with
a
round
depression
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
the
mould
for
a
coin
all
this
fighting
machine
exhaled
an
odour
of
clean
and
healthy
flesh
blended
with
that
of
women
pungent
scents
garabato
with
an
armful
of
cotton
wool
and
white
bandages
knelt
at
his
master
feet
just
like
the
ancient
gladiators
said
ruiz
interrupting
his
conversation
with
the
bilboan
see
you
have
become
a
roman
juan
age
doctor
replied
the
matador
with
a
tinge
of
melancholy
we
are
all
getting
older
when
i
fought
both
bulls
and
hunger
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
want
all
this
i
had
feet
of
iron
in
the
capeas
garabato
placed
small
tufts
of
cotton
wool
between
his
master
toes
and
covered
the
soles
and
the
upper
part
of
his
feet
with
a
thin
layer
of
it
then
pulling
out
the
bandages
he
rolled
them
round
in
tight
spirals
like
the
wrappings
of
an
ancient
mummy
to
fix
them
firmly
he
drew
one
of
the
threaded
needles
from
his
sleeve
and
carefully
and
neatly
sewed
up
their
ends
gallardo
stamped
on
the
ground
with
his
bandaged
feet
which
seemed
to
him
firmer
in
their
soft
wrappings
in
the
bandages
he
felt
them
both
strong
and
agile
the
servant
then
drew
on
the
long
stockings
which
came
halfway
up
the
thigh
thick
and
flexible
like
gaiters
this
was
the
only
protection
for
the
legs
under
the
silk
of
the
fighting
dress
be
careful
of
wrinkles
see
garabato
i
do
want
to
wear
sacks
and
standing
before
the
endeavouring
to
see
both
back
and
front
he
bent
down
and
passed
his
hands
over
his
legs
smoothing
out
the
wrinkles
for
himself
over
these
white
stockings
garabato
drew
others
of
pink
silk
which
alone
remained
visible
when
the
torero
was
fully
dressed
and
then
gallardo
put
his
feet
into
the
pumps
which
he
chose
from
amongst
several
pairs
which
garabato
had
laid
out
on
a
box
all
quite
new
and
with
white
soles
then
began
the
real
task
of
the
dressing
holding
them
by
the
upper
part
the
servant
handed
him
the
fighting
made
of
silk
with
heavy
gold
embroidery
up
the
seams
gallardo
slipped
them
on
and
the
thick
cords
ending
in
gold
tassels
which
drew
in
the
lower
ends
hung
down
over
his
feet
these
cords
which
gather
the
breeches
below
the
knee
constricting
the
leg
to
give
it
artificial
strength
are
called
los
machos
gallardo
swelled
out
the
muscles
of
his
legs
and
ordered
his
servant
to
tighten
the
cords
without
fear
this
was
one
of
the
most
important
operations
as
a
matador
machos
must
be
well
tightened
and
garabato
with
nimble
dexterity
soon
had
the
cords
wound
round
and
tucked
away
out
of
sight
underneath
the
ends
of
the
breeches
with
the
tassels
hanging
down
the
master
then
drew
on
the
fine
lawn
shirt
held
out
by
his
servant
the
front
covered
with
zigzag
crimpings
and
as
delicate
and
clear
as
a
woman
garment
after
he
had
fastened
it
garabato
knotted
the
long
cravat
that
hung
down
dividing
the
chest
with
its
red
line
till
it
lost
itself
in
the
waistband
of
the
drawers
now
remained
the
most
complicated
article
of
clothing
the
a
long
strip
of
silk
over
four
yards
long
which
seemed
to
take
up
the
whole
room
and
which
garabato
handled
with
the
mastery
of
long
experience
the
espada
went
and
stood
near
his
friends
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
fastening
one
end
of
the
sash
to
his
waist
now
then
pay
attention
he
said
to
his
servant
and
do
your
little
best
turning
slowly
on
his
heels
he
gradually
approached
his
servant
while
the
sash
which
he
held
up
rolled
itself
round
his
waist
in
regular
curves
and
gave
it
a
more
graceful
shape
garabato
with
quick
movements
of
his
hand
changed
the
position
of
the
band
of
silk
in
some
turns
the
sash
was
folded
double
in
others
it
was
completely
open
and
always
adjusted
to
the
matador
waist
smooth
and
seemingly
like
one
piece
without
wrinkles
or
unevenness
in
the
course
of
his
rotatory
journey
gallardo
scrupulous
and
very
difficult
to
please
in
the
adornment
of
his
person
several
times
stopped
his
forward
movement
to
step
a
few
paces
back
and
rectify
the
arrangement
that
is
not
right
he
said
curse
you
take
more
care
garabato
after
many
halts
on
the
journey
gallardo
came
to
the
last
turn
with
the
whole
length
of
silk
wound
round
his
waist
the
clever
valet
had
put
stitches
pins
and
all
round
his
master
body
making
his
clothing
literally
all
one
piece
to
get
out
of
them
the
torero
would
have
to
resort
to
the
aid
of
scissors
in
other
hands
he
could
not
get
rid
of
any
one
of
his
garments
till
he
returned
to
the
hotel
unless
indeed
a
bull
did
it
for
him
in
the
open
plaza
and
they
finished
his
undressing
in
the
infirmary
gallardo
sat
down
again
and
garabato
taking
hold
of
the
freed
it
from
the
support
of
the
pins
and
fastened
it
to
the
a
bunch
of
ribbons
like
a
black
cockade
which
reminded
one
of
the
old
redecilla
of
the
earliest
days
of
the
master
stretched
himself
as
if
he
wished
to
put
off
getting
finally
into
the
rest
of
his
costume
he
asked
garabato
to
hand
him
the
cigar
he
had
left
on
the
bedside
table
enquired
what
the
time
was
and
seemed
to
think
that
all
the
clocks
had
gone
fast
it
is
still
early
the
lads
have
not
yet
come
i
do
not
like
to
go
early
to
the
plaza
every
tile
in
the
roof
seems
to
weigh
on
one
when
one
is
waiting
there
at
this
moment
an
hotel
servant
announced
that
the
carriage
with
the
cuadrilla
was
waiting
for
him
downstairs
the
time
had
come
there
was
no
longer
any
pretext
for
delaying
the
moment
of
his
departure
he
slipped
the
over
the
silk
sash
and
above
this
the
jacket
a
piece
of
embroidery
in
very
high
relief
as
heavy
as
a
piece
of
armour
and
flashing
with
light
like
live
coals
the
silk
was
only
visible
on
the
inside
of
the
arms
and
in
two
triangles
on
the
back
almost
the
whole
fabric
was
hidden
beneath
a
mass
of
golden
tufts
and
flowers
with
coloured
precious
stones
in
their
petals
the
epaulettes
were
heavy
masses
of
gold
embroidery
from
which
hung
innumerable
tassels
of
the
same
metal
the
gold
work
reached
the
extreme
edge
of
the
jacket
where
it
ended
in
a
thick
fringe
which
quivered
at
every
step
between
the
openings
of
the
pockets
appeared
the
corners
of
two
silk
handkerchiefs
which
like
the
cravat
and
sash
were
red

out
of
an
oval

took
with
great
care
the
fighting
montera
with
black
frizzed
border
and
pompons
which
stood
out
on
either
side
like

gallardo
put
it
on
being
careful
that
his
mona
should
remain
uncovered
hanging
symmetrically
down
his
back
now
the

from
the
back
of
a
chair
garabato
took
the
cape
called

the

a
princely
mantle
of
silk
the
same
colour
as
his
clothes
and
like
them
covered
with
gold
embroidery
gallardo
slung
it
over
one
shoulder
and
then
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
well
satisfied
with
the
effect
that
not
so
bad
now
to
the
plaza
his
two
friends
took
their
leave
hurriedly
in
order
to
find
a
cab
and
follow
him
garabato
tucked
under
his
arm
a
large
bundle
of
red
cloth
from
the
ends
of
which
projected
the
pommels
and
buttons
of
several
swords
as
gallardo
descended
to
the
vestibule
of
the
hotel
he
saw
that
the
street
was
filled
with
a
noisy
excited
crowd
as
if
some
great
event
had
just
happened
and
he
could
hear
the
buzz
of
a
multitude
whom
he
could
not
see
through
the
the
landlord
and
all
his
family
ran
up
with
outstretched
hands
as
if
they
were
speeding
him
on
a
long
journey
good
luck
may
all
go
well
with
you
the

sinking
all
social

also
shook
his

he
turned
round
smiling
on
every
side
regardless
of
the
anxious
looks
of
the
women
of
the
hotel
thanks
many
thanks
so
long
he
was
another
man
now
now
that
he
had
slung
his
dazzling
cape
over
his
shoulder
a
careless
smile
lit
up
his
face
he
was
pale
with
a
moist
pallor
like
a
sick
man
but
he
laughed
with
the
joy
of
life
and
going
to
meet
his
public
he
adopted
his
new
attitude
with
the
instinctive
facility
of
a
man
who
has
to
put
on
a
fine
air
before
his
audience
he
swaggered
arrogantly
as
he
walked
puffing
at
the
cigar
in
his
left
hand
and
swayed
from
his
hips
under
his
gorgeous
cape
stepping
out
firmly
with
the
pride
of
a
handsome
man
now
then

many

as
he
opened
a
way
for
himself
he
endeavoured
to
protect
his
clothes
from
contact
with
the
dirty
crowd
of
but
enthusiastic
roughs
who
crowded
round
the
hotel
door
they
had
no
money
to
go
to
the
corrida
but
they
took
advantage
of
this
opportunity
of
shaking
hands
with
the
famous
gallardo
or
even
of
touching
some
part
of
his
clothing
close
to
the
pavement
was
waiting
a
wagonette
drawn
by
four
mules
gaily
caparisoned
with
tassels
and
little
bells
garabato
had
already
hoisted
himself
on
to
the
box
seat
with
his
bundle
of
cloth
and
swords
behind
sat
three
toreros
with
their
capes
on
their
knees
all
wearing
clothes
embroidered
as
profusely
as
those
of
the

only
with
silver
instead
of
gold
gallardo
was
obliged
to
defend
himself
with
his
elbows
against
the
outstretched
hands
and
amid
the
jostling
of
the
crowd
he
managed
at
last
to
reach
the
steps
of
the
carriage
amidst
the
general
excitement
he
was
finally
unceremoniously
hoisted
into
his
seat
from
behind
good
afternoon
gentlemen
he
said
curtly
to
his
cuadrilla
he
took
the
seat
nearest
to
the
step
so
that
all
could
see
him
and
he
smiled
and
nodded
his
acknowledgment
of
the
cries
and
shouts
of
applause
of
a
variety
of
ragged
women
and
newspaper
boys
the
carriage
dashed
forward
with
all
the
strength
of
the
spirited
mules
and
filled
the
street
with
a
merry
tinkling
the
crowd
opened
out
to
let
the
team
pass
but
many
hung
on
to
the
carriage
in
imminent
danger
of
falling
under
its
wheels
sticks
and
hats
were
brandished
in
the
air
a
wave
of
enthusiasm
swept
over
the
crowd
it
was
one
of
those
contagious
outbursts
which
at
times
sway
the

driving
them

still
pale

and
repeated

he
was
moved
by
this
outburst
of
popular
enthusiasm
and
proud
of
the

that
made

and
dishevelled
girls
ran
after
the
carriage
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
as
if
they
expected
to
find
something
extraordinary
at
the
end
of
their
mad
career
for
an
hour
previously
the
calle
de
alcala
had
been
a
stream
of
carriages
between
banks
of
crowded
all
hurrying
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
every
sort
of
vehicle
ancient
or
modern
figured
in
this
transient
but
confused
and
noisy
migration
from
the
come
to
light
like
an
anachronism
to
the
modern
motor
car
the
trams
passed
along
crowded
bunches
of
passengers
overflowing
on
to
their
steps
omnibuses
took
up
fares
at
the
corner
of
the
calle
de
sevilla
while
the
conductors
shouted
plaza
plaza
mules
covered
with
tassels
drawing
carriages
full
of
women
in
white
mantillas
and
bright
flowers
trotted
along
gaily
to
the
tinkling
of
their
silvery
bells
every
moment
could
be
heard
exclamations
of
terror
as
some
child
threading
its
way
from
one
pavement
to
the
other
regardless
of
the
rushing
stream
of
vehicles
emerged
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
from
under
the
carriage
wheels
motor
sirens
shrieked
and
coachmen
shouted
newspaper
sellers
hawked
leaflets
giving
a
picture
and
history
of
the
bulls
which
were
going
to
fight
or
the
portraits
and
biographies
of
the
famous
toreros
now
and
then
a
murmur
of
curiosity
swelled
the
dull
humming
of
the
crowd
between
the
dark
uniforms
of
the
municipal
guard
rode
showily
dressed
horsemen
on
lean
miserable
crocks
wearing
jackets
wide
beaver
sombreros
with
a
pompon
on
one
side
like
a
cockade
and
yellow
padding
on
their
legs
these
were
the
picadors
rough
men
of
wild
appearance
who
carried
clinging
to
the
crupper
behind
their
high
moorish
saddles
a
kind
of
devil
dressed
in
red
the
mono
sabio
the
servant
who
had
taken
the
horse
to
their
houses
the
cuadrillas
passed
by
in
open
carriages
the
gold
embroidery
of
the
toreros
flashing
in
the
afternoon
sun
seemed
to
dazzle
the
crowd
and
excite
all
its
enthusiasm
there
fuentes
that
el
bomba
cried
the
people
and
pleased
at
having
recognised
them
they
followed
the
disappearing
carriages
with
anxious
eyes
just
as
if
something
were
going
to
happen
and
they
feared
they
would
be
late
from
the
top
of
the
calle
de
alcala
the
whole
length
of
the
broad
straight
street
could
be
seen
lying
white
under
the
sun
with
its
rows
of
trees
beginning
to
turn
green
under
the
breath
of
spring
the
balconies
were
black
with
onlookers
and
the
roadway
was
only
visible
here
and
there
amidst
the
swarming
crowd
which
on
foot
and
in
carriages
was
making
its
way
towards
la
cibeles
from
this
point
the
ground
rose
between
lines
of
trees
and
buildings
and
the
vista
was
closed
by
the
puerta
de
alcala
outlined
like
a
triumphal
arch
against
the
blue
sky
on
which
floated
a
few
flecks
of
cloud
like
wandering
swans
gallardo
sat
in
silence
replying
to
the
people
only
with
his
fixed
smile
since
his
first
greeting
to
the
banderilleros
he
had
not
uttered
a
word
they
also
were
pale
and
silent
with
anxiety
for
the
unknown
now
that
they
were
amongst
toreros
they
had
laid
aside
as
useless
the
swagger
that
was
necessary
in
the
presence
of
the
public
a
mysterious
inspiration
seemed
to
tell
the
people
of
the
coming
of
the
last
cuadrilla
on
its
way
to
the
plaza
the
group
of
ragamuffins
who
had
run
after
the
carriage
acclaiming
gallardo
had
lost
their
breath
and
had
scattered
amongst
the
traffic
but
all
the
same
people
glanced
behind
them
as
though
they
felt
the
proximity
of
the
famous
torero
and
slackened
their
pace
lining
the
edge
of
the
pavement
so
as
to
get
a
better
view
of
him
women
seated
in
the
carriages
rolling
along
turned
their
heads
as
they
heard
the
tinkling
bells
of
the
trotting
mules
dull
roars
came
from
various
groups
standing
on
the
pavement
these
must
have
been
demonstrations
of
enthusiasm
for
many
waved
their
sombreros
whilst
others
greeted
him
by
flourishing
their
sticks
gallardo
replied
to
all
these
salutations
with
the
smile
of
a
block
with
his
thoughts
far
away
he
took
little
notice
of
them
by
his
side
sat
el
nacional
the
banderillero
in
whom
he
placed
most
trust
a
big
hard
man
older
by
ten
years
than
himself
with
a
grave
manner
and
eyebrows
that
met
between
his
eyes
he
was
well
known
in
the
profession
for
his
kindness
of
heart
and
sterling
worth
and
also
for
his
political
opinions
juan
you
will
not
have
to
complain
of
madrid
said
el
nacional
you
have
taken
the
public
by
storm
but
gallardo
as
if
he
had
not
heard
him
but
felt
obliged
to
give
vent
to
the
thoughts
that
were
weighing
on
him
replied
my
heart
tells
me
that
something
will
happen
this
afternoon
as
they
arrived
at
la
cibeles
the
carriage
stopped
a
great
funeral
was
passing
through
the
prado
in
the
direction
of
castellana
and
cut
through
the
avalanche
of
carriages
coming
from
the
calle
de
alcala
gallardo
turned
still
paler
as
he
looked
with
terrified
eyes
at
the
passing
of
the
silver
cross
and
the
procession
of
priests
who
broke
into
a
mournful
chant
as
they
gazed
some
with
aversion
others
with
envy
at
the
stream
of
godless
people
who
were
rushing
to
amuse
themselves
the
espada
hastened
to
take
off
his
montero
his
banderilleros
did
the
same
with
the
exception
of
el
nacional
curse
you
cried
gallardo
take
off
your
cap
rascal
he
glared
at
him
as
if
about
to
strike
him
fully
convinced
by
some
confused
intuition
that
this
impiety
would
bring
down
on
him
the
greatest
misfortunes
all
right
i
take
it
off
said
el
nacional
with
the
sulkiness
of
a
thwarted
child
as
he
saw
the
cross
moving
off
i
take
it
off
but
it
is
to
the
dead
man
they
were
obliged
to
stop
for
some
time
to
let
the
funeral
pass
bad
luck
murmured
gallardo
his
voice
trembling
with
rage
who
can
have
thought
of
bringing
a
funeral
across
the
way
to
the
plaza
curse
them
i
said
something
would
happen
el
nacional
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
superstition
and
fanaticism
god
or
nature
do
trouble
about
these
things
these
words
which
increased
the
irritation
of
gallardo
seemed
to
dispel
the
grave
preoccupation
of
the
other
toreros
and
they
began
to
laugh
at
their
companion
as
indeed
they
always
did
when
he
aired
his
favourite
phrase
god
or
nature
as
soon
as
the
way
was
clear
the
carriage
resumed
its
former
speed
travelling
as
fast
as
the
mules
could
trot
and
passing
all
the
other
vehicles
which
were
converging
on
the
plaza
on
arriving
there
it
turned
to
the
left
making
for
the
door
named
de
caballerizas
which
led
to
the
yards
and
stables
but
compelled
to
pass
slowly
through
the
compact
crowd
gallardo
received
another
ovation
as
followed
by
his
banderilleros
he
alighted
from
the
carriage
pushing
and
elbowing
his
way
in
order
to
save
his
clothes
from
the
touch
of
dirty
hands
smiling
greetings
everywhere
and
hiding
his
right
hand
which
everybody
wished
to
shake
make
way
please
gentlemen
many
thanks
the
great
courtyard
between
the
main
building
of
the
plaza
and
the
boundary
wall
of
its
outbuildings
was
full
of
people
who
before
taking
their
seats
wished
to
get
a
near
view
of
the
whilst
on
horseback
mounted
high
above
the
crowd
could
be
seen
the
picadors
and
the
alguaciles
in
their
seventeenth
century
costumes
on
one
side
of
the
courtyard
stood
a
row
of
brick
buildings
with
vines
trellised
over
the
doors
and
pots
of
flowers
in
the
windows
it
was
quite
a
small
town
of
offices
workshops
stables
and
houses
in
which
lived
stablemen
carpenters
and
other
servants
of
the
the
diestro
made
his
way
laboriously
through
the
various
groups
and
his
name
passed
from
lip
to
lip
amidst
exclamations
of
admiration
gallardo
here
is
el
gallardo
olé
viva
españa
and
he
with
no
thought
but
that
of
the
adoration
of
the
public
swaggered
along
serene
as
a
god
and
gay
and
just
as
if
he
were
attending
a
fete
given
in
his
honour
suddenly
two
arms
were
thrown
round
his
neck
and
at
the
same
time
a
strong
smell
of
wine
assailed
his
nostrils
a
real
man
my
beauty
three
cheers
for
the
heroes
it
was
a
man
of
good
appearance
a
tradesman
who
had
breakfasted
with
some
friends
whose
smiling
vigilance
he
thought
he
had
escaped
but
who
were
watching
him
from
a
short
distance
he
leant
his
head
on
the
espada
shoulder
and
let
it
remain
there
as
though
he
intended
to
drop
off
into
a
sleep
of
ecstasy
in
that
position
gallardo
pushed
and
the
man
friends
pulled
and
the
espada
was
soon
free
of
this
intolerable
embrace
but
the
tippler
finding
himself
parted
from
his
idol
broke
out
into
loud
shouts
of
admiration
olé
for
such
men
all
nations
of
the
earth
should
come
and
admire
toreros
like
this
and
die
of
envy
they
may
have
ships
they
may
have
money
but
that
all
rot
they
have
no
bulls
and
no
men
like
this
hurrah
my
lads
long
live
my
country
gallardo
crossed
a
large
hall
quite
bare
of
furniture
where
his
professional
companions
were
standing
surrounded
by
admiring
groups
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
around
a
door
he
entered
a
small
dark
and
narrow
room
at
one
end
of
which
lights
were
burning
it
was
the
chapel
an
old
picture
called
the
virgin
of
the
dove
filled
the
back
of
the
altar
on
the
table
four
tapers
were
burning
and
several
bunches
of
dusty
muslin
flowers
stood
in
common
pottery
vases
the
chapel
was
full
of
people
the
aficionados
of
humble
class
assembled
in
it
so
as
to
see
the
great
men
close
at
hand
in
the
darkness
some
stood
bareheaded
in
the
front
row
whilst
others
sat
on
benches
and
chairs
the
greater
part
of
them
turning
their
backs
on
the
virgin
looking
eagerly
towards
the
door
to
call
out
a
name
as
soon
as
the
glitter
of
a
gala
dress
appeared
the
banderilleros
and
picadors
poor
devils
who
were
going
to
risk
their
lives
the
same
as
the
maestros
scarcely
caused
a
whisper
by
their
presence
only
the
most
fervent
aficionados
knew
their
nicknames
presently
there
was
a
prolonged
murmur
a
name
repeated
from
mouth
to
mouth
fuentes
it
is
el
fuentes
the
elegant
torero
tall
and
graceful
his
cape
loose
over
his
shoulder
walked
up
to
the
altar
bending
his
knee
with
theatrical
affectation
the
lights
were
reflected
in
his
gipsy
eyes
and
fell
across
the
fine
agile
kneeling
figure
after
he
had
finished
his
prayer
and
crossed
himself
he
rose
walking
backwards
towards
the
door
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
image
like
a
tenor
who
retires
bowing
to
his
audience
gallardo
was
more
simple
in
his
piety
he
entered
montero
in
hand
his
cape
gathered
round
him
walking
no
less
arrogantly
but
when
he
came
opposite
the
image
he
knelt
with
both
knees
on
the
ground
giving
himself
over
entirely
to
his
prayers
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
hundreds
of
eyes
fixed
on
him
his
simple
christian
soul
trembled
with
fear
and
remorse
he
prayed
for
protection
with
the
fervour
of
ignorant
men
who
live
in
continual
danger
and
who
believe
in
every
sort
of
adverse
influence
and
supernatural
protection
for
the
first
time
in
the
whole
of
that
day
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
his
mother
poor
carmen
down
in
seville
waiting
for
his
telegram
the
señora
angustias
tranquil
with
her
fowls
at
the
farm
of
la
rinconada
not
knowing
for
certain
where
her
son
was
fighting
and
he
here
with
that
terrible
presentiment
that
something
would
happen
that
afternoon
virgin
of
the
dove
give
a
little
protection
he
would
be
good
he
would
forget
the
rest
he
would
live
as
god
commands
his
superstitious
spirit
being
comforted
by
this
empty
repentance
he
left
the
chapel
still
under
its
influence
with
clouded
eyes
that
did
not
see
the
people
who
obstructed
his
way
outside
in
the
room
where
the
toreros
were
waiting
he
was
saluted
by
a
gentleman
in
black
clothes
in
which
he
appeared
ill
at
ease
bad
luck
murmured
the
torero
moving
on
as
i
said
before
something
will
happen
it
was
the
chaplain
of
the
plaza
an
enthusiast
in
tauromachia
who
had
arrived
with
the
holy
oils
concealed
beneath
his
coat
he
was
priest
of
the
suburb
of
la
prosperidad
and
for
years
past
had
maintained
a
heated
controversy
with
another
parish
priest
in
the
centre
of
madrid
who
claimed
a
better
right
to
monopolise
the
religious
service
of
the
plaza
he
came
to
the
plaza
accompanied
by
a
neighbour
who
served
him
as
sacristan
in
return
for
a
seat
for
the
corrida
on
these
days
he
chose
by
turns
from
amongst
his
friends
and
protégés
the
one
whom
he
wished
to
favour
with
the
seat
reserved
for
the
sacristan
he
hired
a
smart
carriage
at
the
expense
of
the
management
and
carrying
under
his
coat
the
sacred
vessel
started
for
the
plaza
where
two
front
seats
were
kept
for
him
close
to
the
entrance
for
the
bulls
the
priest
entered
the
chapel
with
the
air
of
a
proprietor
scandalised
by
the
behaviour
of
the
public
all
had
their
heads
uncovered
but
they
were
talking
loudly
and
some
even
smoking
caballeros
this
is
not
a
café
you
will
do
me
the
favour
of
going
outside
the
corrida
is
about
to
begin
this
news
caused
a
general
exodus
during
which
the
priest
took
out
the
hidden
oils
and
placed
them
in
a
painted
wooden
box
he
too
having
concealed
his
sacred
deposit
hurried
out
in
order
to
reach
his
seat
in
the
plaza
before
the
appearance
of
the
cuadrillas
the
crowd
had
vanished
nobody
was
to
be
seen
in
the
courtyard
but
men
dressed
in
silk
and
gold
embroidery
horsemen
in
yellow
with
large
beavers
alguaciles
on
horseback
and
the
servants
on
duty
in
their
liveries
of
blue
and
gold
in
the
doorway
called
de
caballos
under
the
arch
forming
the
entrance
to
the
plaza
the
toreros
formed
up
for
the
procession
with
the
promptitude
which
comes
of
constant
practice
in
front
the
maestros
some
distance
behind
them
the
banderilleros
and
beyond
these
again
in
the
courtyard
outside
the
clattering
rearguard
the
stern
squadron
of
picadors
redolent
of
hot
leather
and
manure
and
mounted
on
skeleton
horses
with
a
bandage
over
one
eye
in
the
far
distance
like
the
baggage
of
this
army
fidgeted
the
teams
of
mules
destined
to
drag
out
the
carcases
strong
lively
animals
with
shining
skins
their
harness
covered
with
tassels
and
bells
and
their
collars
ornamented
with
a
small
national
flag
at
the
other
end
of
the
archway
above
the
wooden
barricade
which
closed
the
lower
half
could
be
seen
a
shining
patch
of
blue
sky
the
roof
of
the
plaza
and
a
section
of
the
seats
with
its
compact
swarming
mass
of
occupants
amongst
which
fluttered
fans
and
papers
like
gaily
coloured
butterflies
through
this
arcade
there
swept
a
strong
breeze
like
the
breath
of
an
immense
lung
and
faint
harmonious
sounds
floated
on
the
waves
of
air
betokening
distant
music
guessed
at
rather
than
heard
along
the
sides
of
the
archway
could
be
seen
a
row
of
heads
those
of
the
spectators
on
the
nearest
benches
who
peered
over
in
their
anxiety
to
get
the
first
possible
glimpse
of
the
heroes
of
the
day
gallardo
took
his
place
in
line
with
the
other
espadas
they
neither
spoke
nor
smiled
a
grave
inclination
of
the
head
being
all
the
greeting
that
they
exchanged
each
seemed
wrapped
in
his
own
preoccupation
letting
his
thoughts
wander
far
afield
or
perhaps
with
the
vacuity
of
deep
emotion
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
outwardly
this
preoccupation
was
manifested
in
an
apparently
unending
arrangement
and
of
their
capes
spreading
them
over
the
shoulder
folding
the
ends
round
the
waist
or
arranging
them
so
that
under
this
mantle
of
bright
colours
their
legs
cased
in
silk
and
gold
should
be
free
and
without
encumbrance
all
their
faces
were
pale
not
with
a
dull
pallor
but
with
the
bright
hectic
moist
shine
of
excitement
their
minds
were
in
the
arena
as
yet
invisible
to
them
and
they
felt
the
irresistible
fear
of
things
that
might
be
happening
on
the
other
side
of
a
wall
the
terror
of
the
unknown
the
indefinite
danger
that
is
felt
but
not
seen
how
would
this
afternoon
end
from
beyond
the
cuadrillas
was
heard
the
sound
of
the
trotting
of
two
horses
coming
along
underneath
the
outer
arcades
of
the
plaza
this
was
the
arrival
of
the
alguaciles
in
their
small
black
capeless
mantles
and
broad
hats
surmounted
with
red
and
yellow
feathers
they
had
just
finished
clearing
the
ring
of
all
the
intruding
crowd
and
now
came
to
place
themselves
as
at
the
head
of
the
cuadrillas
the
doorways
of
the
arch
were
thrown
wide
open
as
also
were
those
of
the
barrier
in
front
of
them
the
huge
ring
was
revealed
the
real
plaza
an
immense
circular
expanse
of
sand
on
which
would
be
enacted
the
afternoon
tragedy
one
which
would
excite
the
feelings
and
rejoicings
of
fourteen
thousand
spectators
the
confused
harmonious
sounds
now
became
louder
resolving
themselves
into
lively
reckless
music
a
noisy
clanging
triumphal
march
that
made
the
audience
hip
and
shoulder
to
its
martial
air
forward
fine
fellows
the
blinking
at
the
sudden
change
stepped
out
from
darkness
to
light
from
the
silence
of
the
quiet
arcade
to
the
roar
of
the
ring
where
the
crowd
on
the
tiers
of
benches
throbbing
with
excitement
and
curiosity
rose
to
its
feet
en
masse
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
view
the
toreros
advanced
dwarfed
immediately
they
trod
the
arena
by
the
immensity
of
their
surroundings
they
seemed
like
brilliant
dolls
on
whose
embroideries
the
sunlight
flashed
in
iridescent
hues
and
their
graceful
movements
fired
the
people
with
the
delight
that
a
child
takes
in
some
marvellous
toy
the
mad
impulse
which
agitates
a
crowd
sending
a
shiver
down
its
backbone
and
giving
it
for
no
particular
reason
affected
the
entire
plaza
some
applauded
others
more
enthusiastic
or
more
nervous
shouted
the
music
clanged
and
in
the
midst
of
this
universal
tumult
the
cuadrillas
advanced
solemnly
and
slowly
from
the
entrance
door
up
to
the
presidential
chair
making
up
for
the
shortness
of
their
step
by
the
graceful
swing
of
their
arms
and
the
swaying
of
their
bodies
meanwhile
on
the
circle
of
blue
sky
above
the
plaza
fluttered
several
white
pigeons
terrified
by
the
roar
which
arose
from
this
crater
of
bricks
they
felt
themselves
different
men
as
they
advanced
over
the
sand
they
were
risking
their
lives
for
something
more
than
money
their
doubts
and
terrors
of
the
unknown
had
been
left
outside
the
barricades
now
they
trod
the
arena
they
were
face
to
face
with
their
public
reality
had
come
the
longing
for
glory
in
their
barbarous
ignorant
minds
the
desire
to
excel
their
comrades
the
pride
in
their
own
strength
and
dexterity
all
blinded
them
making
them
forget
all
fears
and
inspiring
them
with
the
daring
of
brute
force
gallardo
was
quite
transfigured
he
drew
himself
up
as
he
walked
wishing
to
appear
the
tallest
he
moved
with
the
arrogance
of
a
conqueror
looking
all
round
him
with
an
air
of
triumph
as
though
his
two
companions
did
not
exist
everything
was
his
both
the
plaza
and
the
public
he
felt
himself
at
that
moment
capable
of
killing
every
bull
alive
on
the
broad
pasture
lands
of
andalusia
or
castille
all
the
applause
was
meant
for
him
he
was
quite
sure
of
that
the
thousands
of
feminine
eyes
shaded
by
white
mantillas
in
the
boxes
or
along
the
barriers
were
fixed
on
him
only
of
that
there
could
be
no
manner
of
doubt
the
public
adored
him
and
while
he
advanced
smiling
with
pride
as
though
the
ovation
were
intended
for
himself
alone
cast
his
eyes
along
the
rows
of
seats
noticing
the
places
where
the
largest
groups
of
his
partizans
were
massed
and
ignoring
those
where
his
friends
had
congregated
they
saluted
the
president
montero
in
hand
and
then
the
brilliant
parade
broke
up
peons
and
horsemen
scattering
in
all
directions
whilst
an
alguacil
caught
in
his
hat
the
key
thrown
to
him
by
the
president
gallardo
walked
towards
the
barrier
behind
which
his
most
enthusiastic
supporters
stood
and
gave
into
their
charge
his
beautiful
cape
which
was
spread
along
the
edge
of
the
palisade
the
sacred
symbol
of
a
faction
his
most
enthusiastic
partizans
stood
up
waving
their
hands
and
sticks
to
greet
the
matador
and
loudly
proclaiming
their
hopes
let
us
see
what
the
lad
from
seville
will
do
and
he
smiled
as
he
leant
against
the
barrier
proud
of
his
strength
repeating
to
all
many
thanks
he
will
do
what
he
can
it
was
not
only
his
partizans
who
showed
their
high
hopes
on
seeing
him
everywhere
he
found
adherents
amongst
the
crowd
which
anticipated
deep
excitement
he
was
a
torero
who
promised
hule
according
to
the
expression
of
the
aficionados
and
such
hule
was
likely
to
lead
to
a
bed
in
the
infirmary
everyone
thought
he
was
destined
to
die
gored
to
death
in
the
plaza
and
for
this
very
reason
they
applauded
him
with
homicidal
enthusiasm
with
a
barbarous
interest
like
that
of
the
misanthrope
who
followed
a
tamer
everywhere
awaiting
the
moment
when
he
would
be
devoured
by
his
wild
beasts
gallardo
laughed
at
the
ancient
aficionados
grave
doctors
of
tauromachia
who
judged
it
impossible
that
an
accident
should
happen
if
a
torero
conformed
to
the
rules
of
the
art
rules
forsooth
he
ignored
them
and
took
no
trouble
to
learn
them
bravery
and
audacity
only
were
necessary
to
ensure
victory
almost
blindly
with
no
other
rule
than
his
own
temerity
no
other
help
than
his
own
bodily
faculties
he
had
made
a
rapid
career
for
himself
forcing
outbursts
of
wonder
from
the
people
and
astonishing
them
with
his
mad
courage
he
had
not
like
other
matadors
risen
by
regular
steps
serving
long
years
as
peon
and
banderillero
at
the
maestros
side
the
bulls
horns
caused
him
no
fear
hunger
gores
worse
he
said
the
great
thing
was
to
rise
quickly
and
the
public
had
seen
him
commence
at
once
as
espada
and
in
a
few
years
enjoy
an
immense
popularity
it
admired
him
for
the
very
reason
which
made
a
catastrophe
so
certain
it
was
inflamed
with
a
horrible
enthusiasm
by
the
blindness
with
which
this
man
defied
death
and
paid
him
the
same
care
and
attention
as
are
paid
to
a
condemned
man
in
the
chapel
this
torero
was
not
one
who
held
anything
back
he
gave
them
everything
including
his
life
he
was
worth
the
money
he
cost
and
the
crowd
with
the
brutality
of
those
who
watch
danger
from
a
safe
place
admired
and
hallooed
on
the
hero
the
more
prudent
shrugged
their
shoulders
regarding
him
as
a
suicide
playing
with
fate
and
murmured
as
long
as
it
lasts
amid
a
clash
of
kettledrums
and
trumpets
the
first
bull
rushed
out
gallardo
with
his
working
cloak
devoid
of
ornament
hanging
on
his
arm
remained
by
the
barrier
close
to
the
benches
where
his
partizans
sat
disdainfully
motionless
as
though
the
eyes
of
the
whole
audience
were
fixed
on
him
that
bull
was
for
some
one
else
he
would
give
signs
of
existence
when
his
own
bull
came
out
but
the
applause
at
the
cloak
play
executed
by
his
companions
drew
him
out
of
this
immobility
and
in
spite
of
his
intentions
he
joined
in
the
fray
performing
several
feats
in
which
he
showed
more
audacity
than
skill
the
whole
plaza
applauded
him
roused
by
the
delight
they
felt
at
his
daring
when
fuentes
killed
his
first
bull
and
went
towards
the
presidential
chair
saluting
the
crowd
gallardo
turned
paler
than
before
as
though
any
expression
of
gratification
that
was
not
for
him
was
a
studied
insult
now
his
turn
had
come
they
would
see
great
things
he
did
not
know
for
certain
what
they
might
be
but
he
was
disposed
to
startle
the
public
as
soon
as
the
second
bull
came
out
gallardo
thanks
to
his
mobility
and
his
desire
to
shine
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
plaza
his
cape
was
constantly
close
to
the
beast
muzzle
a
picador
of
his
own
cuadrilla
the
one
named
potaje
was
thrown
from
his
horse
and
lay
helpless
close
to
the
horns
the
maestro
seizing
the
fierce
beast
tail
pulled
with
such
herculean
strength
that
he
obliged
it
to
turn
round
till
the
dismounted
rider
was
safe
this
was
a
feat
that
the
public
applauded
wildly
when
the
play
of
the
banderilleros
began
gallardo
remained
in
the
passage
between
the
barriers
awaiting
the
signal
to
kill
el
nacional
with
the
darts
in
his
hand
challenged
the
bull
in
the
centre
of
the
arena
there
was
nothing
graceful
in
his
movements
nor
any
proud
daring
simply
the
question
of
earning
his
bread
down
in
seville
he
had
four
little
ones
who
if
he
died
would
find
no
other
father
he
would
do
his
duty
and
nothing
more
stick
in
his
banderillas
like
a
journeyman
of
tauromachia
not
desiring
applause
and
trying
to
avoid
hissing
when
he
had
stuck
in
the
pair
a
few
on
the
vast
tiers
applauded
while
others
alluding
to
his
ideas
found
fault
with
the
banderillero
in
chaffing
tones
quit
politics
and
strike
better
and
el
nacional
deceived
by
the
distance
heard
these
shouts
and
acknowledged
them
smilingly
like
his
master
when
gallardo
leapt
again
into
the
arena
the
crowd
hearing
the
blare
of
trumpets
and
drums
which
announced
the
final
death
stroke
became
restless
and
buzzed
with
excitement
that
matador
was
their
own
now
they
would
see
something
fine
he
took
the
muleta
from
the
hands
of
garabato
who
offered
it
to
him
folded
from
inside
the
barrier
and
drew
the
rapier
which
his
servant
also
presented
to
him
then
with
short
steps
he
went
and
stood
in
front
of
the
president
chair
carrying
his
montero
in
one
hand
all
stretched
out
their
necks
devouring
their
idol
with
their
eyes
but
no
one
could
hear
the
brindis
the
proud
figure
with
its
magnificent
stature
the
body
thrown
back
to
give
more
strength
to
his
voice
produced
the
same
effect
on
the
masses
as
the
most
eloquent
harangue
as
he
ended
his
speech
giving
a
half
turn
and
throwing
his
montero
on
the
ground
the
noisy
enthusiasm
broke
out
olé
for
the
lad
from
seville
now
they
would
see
real
sport
and
the
spectators
looked
at
one
another
mutely
promising
each
other
tremendous
happenings
a
shiver
ran
over
all
the
rows
of
seats
as
if
they
awaited
something
sublime
then
silence
fell
on
the
crowd
a
silence
so
deep
that
one
would
have
thought
that
the
plaza
had
suddenly
become
empty
the
life
of
thousands
of
people
seemed
concentrated
in
their
eyes
no
one
seemed
even
to
breathe
gallardo
advanced
slowly
towards
the
bull
carrying
the
muleta
resting
against
his
stomach
like
a
flag
and
with
sword
waving
in
his
other
hand
swinging
like
a
pendulum
to
his
step
turning
his
head
for
an
instant
he
saw
he
was
being
followed
by
el
nacional
and
another
peon
of
his
cuadrilla
their
cloaks
on
their
arms
ready
to
assist
him
go
out
everybody
his
voice
rang
out
in
the
silence
of
the
plaza
reaching
up
to
the
furthest
benches
and
was
answered
by
a
roar
of
admiration
go
out
everybody
he
had
said
go
out
to
everybody
what
a
man
he
remained
completely
alone
close
to
the
beast
and
instantly
there
was
again
silence
very
calmly
he
unrolled
the
muleta
and
spread
it
advancing
a
few
steps
at
the
same
time
till
he
flung
it
almost
on
the
muzzle
of
the
bull
who
stood
bewildered
and
frightened
at
the
audacity
the
audience
did
not
dare
to
speak
nor
scarcely
to
breathe
but
admiration
flashed
in
their
eyes
what
a
man
he
was
going
up
to
the
very
horns
he
stamped
impatiently
on
the
sand
with
one
foot
inciting
the
animal
to
attack
and
the
enormous
mass
of
flesh
with
its
sharp
defences
fell
bellowing
upon
him
the
muleta
passed
over
its
horns
which
grazed
the
tassels
and
fringes
of
the
matador
costume
he
remained
firm
in
his
place
his
only
movement
being
to
throw
his
body
slightly
back
a
roar
from
the
masses
replied
to
this
pass
of
the
muleta
olé
the
brute
turned
once
more
attacking
the
man
and
his
rag
and
the
pass
was
again
repeated
amid
the
roars
of
the
audience
the
bull
each
time
more
infuriated
by
the
deception
again
and
again
attacked
the
fighter
who
repeated
the
passes
with
the
muleta
scarcely
moving
off
his
ground
excited
by
the
proximity
of
danger
and
the
admiring
acclamations
of
the
crowd
which
seemed
to
intoxicate
him
gallardo
felt
the
wild
beast
snorting
close
to
him
its
breath
moist
with
slaver
fell
on
his
face
and
right
hand
becoming
familiar
with
the
feeling
he
seemed
to
look
on
the
brute
as
a
good
friend
who
was
going
to
let
himself
be
killed
to
contribute
to
his
glory
at
last
the
bull
remained
quiet
for
a
few
instants
as
if
tired
of
the
game
looking
with
eyes
full
of
sombre
reflexion
at
this
man
and
his
red
cloth
suspecting
in
his
limited
brain
the
existence
of
some
stratagem
that
by
attack
after
attack
would
lead
him
to
his
death
gallardo
felt
the
great
of
his
finest
feats
now
then
he
caught
the
muleta
with
a
circular
sweep
of
his
left
hand
rolling
it
round
the
stick
and
raised
his
right
to
the
height
of
his
eyes
standing
with
the
sword
bending
down
towards
the
nape
of
the
neck
a
tumult
of
surprised
protest
broke
from
the
crowd
strike
shouted
thousands
of
voices
no
no
it
was
too
soon
the
bull
was
not
well
placed
it
would
charge
and
catch
him
he
was
acting
outside
all
rules
of
the
art
but
what
did
rules
or
life
itself
signify
to
that
reckless
man
suddenly
he
threw
himself
forward
with
his
sword
at
the
same
instant
that
the
beast
fell
upon
him
the
encounter
was
brutal
savage
for
an
instant
man
and
beast
formed
one
confused
mass
and
thus
advanced
a
few
paces
no
one
could
see
who
was
the
conqueror
the
man
with
one
arm
and
part
of
his
body
between
the
two
horns
or
the
brute
lowering
his
head
and
fighting
to
catch
on
those
horns
the
brilliantly
coloured
golden
puppet
which
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
from
him
at
last
the
group
separated
the
muleta
remained
on
the
ground
like
a
rag
and
the
fighter
his
hands
empty
emerged
staggering
from
the
impetus
of
the
shock
till
some
distance
away
he
recovered
his
equilibrium
his
clothes
were
disordered
and
the
cravat
floating
outside
the
waistcoat
was
gashed
and
torn
by
the
bull
horns
the
bull
continued
its
rush
with
the
impetus
of
the
first
charge
on
its
broad
neck
the
red
pommel
of
the
sword
buried
up
to
the
hilt
scarcely
could
be
seen
suddenly
it
stopped
short
in
its
career
rolling
with
a
painful
curtseying
motion
then
folded
its
bent
its
head
till
its
bellowing
muzzle
touched
the
sand
and
finally
subsided
in
convulsions
of
agony
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
plaza
were
falling
down
as
if
all
its
bricks
were
rattling
against
one
another
as
if
the
crowd
was
going
to
fly
in
panic
when
all
rose
suddenly
to
their
feet
pale
trembling
gesticulating
waving
their
arms
dead
what
a
sword
thrust
they
had
all
thought
for
a
second
that
the
matador
was
impaled
on
the
horns
all
thought
they
would
assuredly
see
him
fall
bleeding
on
the
sand
but
now
they
saw
him
standing
there
still
giddy
from
the
shock
but
smiling
the
surprise
and
astonishment
of
it
all
increased
their
enthusiasm
oh
the
brute
they
roared
from
the
benches
not
finding
any
better
word
with
which
to
express
their
unbounded
astonishment
what
a
savage
hats
flew
into
the
arena
overwhelming
rounds
of
applause
ran
like
a
torrent
of
hail
from
bench
to
bench
as
the
matador
advanced
through
the
arena
following
the
circle
of
the
barriers
till
he
arrived
opposite
the
presidential
chair
then
as
gallardo
opened
his
arms
to
salute
the
president
the
thundering
ovation
redoubled
all
shouted
claiming
the
honours
of
the
maestria
for
the
matador
he
ought
to
be
given
the
ear
never
was
the
honour
better
deserved
like
that
are
seldom
seen
and
the
enthusiasm
waxed
even
greater
when
one
of
the
attendants
of
the
plaza
presented
him
with
a
dark
hairy
bloody
triangle
it
was
the
tip
of
one
of
the
beast
ears
the
third
bull
was
already
in
the
circus
and
still
the
ovation
to
gallardo
continued
as
if
the
audience
had
not
recovered
from
its
astonishment
and
nothing
that
could
possibly
happen
during
the
rest
of
the
corrida
could
be
of
the
slightest
interest
the
other
toreros
pale
with
professional
jealousy
exerted
themselves
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public
but
the
applause
they
gained
sounded
weak
and
timid
after
the
outburst
that
had
preceded
it
the
public
seemed
exhausted
by
their
former
excess
of
enthusiasm
and
only
paid
attention
to
the
fresh
events
unfolding
themselves
in
the
arena
soon
violent
disputes
arose
between
the
rows
of
seats
the
supporters
of
the
other
matadors
who
by
this
time
had
become
calm
and
had
recovered
from
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
which
had
mastered
them
in
common
with
everyone
else
began
to
justify
their
former
spontaneous
outburst
by
criticising
gallardo
very
brave
very
daring
suicidal
but
that
was
not
art
on
the
other
hand
the
worshippers
of
the
idol
who
were
even
more
vehement
and
brutal
and
who
admired
his
audacity
from
innate
sympathy
were
rabid
with
the
rage
of
zealots
who
hear
doubts
cast
on
the
miracles
of
their
own
particular
saint
various
minor
incidents
which
caused
commotion
amidst
the
benches
also
distracted
the
attention
of
the
audience
suddenly
there
was
a
commotion
in
some
section
of
the
amphitheatre
everybody
stood
up
turning
their
backs
on
the
arena
and
arms
and
sticks
were
flourished
above
the
sea
of
heads
the
rest
of
the
audience
forgot
the
arena
and
concentrated
their
attention
on
the
fracas
and
the
large
numbers
painted
on
the
walls
of
the
inside
barrier
which
distinguished
the
blocks
of
seats
a
fight
in
no
they
yelled
joyfully
now
there
a
row
in
no
finally
the
whole
audience
caught
the
contagion
got
excited
and
stood
up
each
trying
to
look
over
his
neighbour
head
but
all
they
were
able
to
see
was
the
slow
ascent
of
the
police
who
pushed
a
way
for
themselves
from
bench
to
bench
and
finally
reached
the
group
where
the
disturbance
was
going
on
sit
down
shouted
the
more
peaceable
who
were
prevented
from
seeing
the
arena
where
the
toreros
were
continuing
their
work
the
general
tumult
was
gradually
calmed
and
the
rows
of
heads
round
the
circular
line
of
benches
resumed
their
previous
regularity
during
the
progress
of
the
corrida
but
the
audience
seemed
to
have
its
nerves
and
gave
vent
to
its
feelings
by
animosity
or
contemptuous
silence
towards
certain
of
the
fighters
the
crowd
exhausted
by
its
previous
outburst
of
emotion
regarded
all
that
followed
as
insipid
and
so
diverted
its
boredom
by
eating
and
drinking
the
refreshment
sellers
of
the
plaza
walked
round
between
the
barriers
throwing
up
the
articles
asked
for
with
marvellous
dexterity
oranges
flew
like
golden
balls
up
to
the
very
highest
benches
in
a
straight
line
from
the
hands
of
the
seller
to
that
of
the
buyer
as
if
drawn
by
a
thread
bottles
of
aerated
drinks
were
opened
and
the
golden
wine
of
andalusia
shone
in
the
glasses
soon
a
current
of
curiosity
ran
round
the
seats
fuentes
was
going
to
fix
banderillas
in
his
bull
and
everyone
expected
something
extraordinarily
dexterous
and
graceful
he
advanced
alone
into
the
midst
of
the
plaza
with
the
banderillas
in
his
hand
quiet
and
moving
slowly
as
if
he
were
beginning
some
game
the
bull
followed
his
movements
with
anxious
eyes
astonished
to
see
this
man
alone
in
front
of
him
after
the
previous
of
outspread
cloaks
cruel
pikes
sticking
into
his
neck
and
horses
which
placed
themselves
in
front
of
his
horns
as
if
offering
themselves
to
his
attack
the
man
hypnotised
the
beast
approaching
so
close
as
even
to
touch
his
pole
with
the
banderillas
then
with
short
tripping
steps
he
ran
away
pursued
by
the
bull
which
followed
him
as
though
fascinated
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
plaza
the
animal
seemed
cowed
by
the
fighter
and
obeyed
his
every
movement
until
at
last
thinking
the
game
had
lasted
long
enough
the
man
opened
his
arms
with
a
dart
in
either
hand
drew
up
his
graceful
slim
figure
on
and
advancing
towards
the
bull
with
majestic
tranquillity
fixed
the
coloured
darts
in
the
neck
of
the
surprised
animal
three
times
he
performed
this
feat
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
audience
those
who
thought
themselves
connoisseurs
now
had
their
revenge
for
the
explosion
of
admiration
provoked
by
gallardo
this
was
what
a
true
torero
should
be
this
was
real
art
gallardo
stood
by
the
barrier
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
face
with
a
towel
handed
to
him
by
garabato
afterwards
he
drank
some
water
and
turned
his
back
on
the
circus
so
as
not
to
see
the
prowess
of
his
rival
outside
the
plaza
he
esteemed
his
rivals
with
the
fraternity
established
by
danger
but
once
they
trod
the
arena
they
all
became
his
enemies
and
their
triumphs
pained
him
like
insults
this
general
enthusiasm
for
fuentes
which
obscured
his
own
great
triumphs
seemed
to
him
like
robbery
on
the
appearance
of
the
fifth
bull
which
was
his
he
leapt
into
the
arena
burning
to
astonish
everybody
by
his
prowess
if
a
picador
fell
he
spread
his
cloak
and
drew
the
bull
to
the
other
end
of
the
arena
bewildering
it
with
a
succession
of
cloak
play
that
left
the
beast
motionless
then
gallardo
would
touch
it
on
the
muzzle
with
one
foot
or
would
take
off
his
montero
and
lay
it
between
the
horns
again
and
again
he
took
advantage
of
its
stupefaction
and
exposed
his
stomach
in
an
audacious
challenge
or
knelt
close
to
it
as
though
about
to
lie
down
beneath
its
nose
under
their
breath
the
old
aficionados
muttered
monkey
tricks
buffooneries
that
would
not
have
been
tolerated
in
former
days
but
amidst
the
general
shouts
of
approval
they
were
obliged
to
keep
their
opinion
to
themselves
when
the
signal
for
the
banderillas
was
given
the
audience
was
amazed
to
see
gallardo
take
the
darts
from
el
nacional
and
advance
with
them
towards
the
bull
there
was
a
shout
of
protest
he
with
the
banderillas
they
all
knew
his
failing
in
that
respect
banderilla
play
was
only
for
those
who
had
risen
in
their
career
step
by
step
who
before
arriving
at
being
matadors
had
been
banderilleros
for
many
years
by
the
side
of
their
masters
and
gallardo
had
begun
at
the
other
end
killing
bulls
from
the
time
he
first
began
in
the
plaza
no
no
shouted
the
crowd
doctor
ruiz
yelled
and
thumped
inside
the
barrier
leave
that
alone
lad
you
know
well
enough
what
is
wanted
kill
but
gallardo
despised
his
audience
and
was
deaf
to
its
advice
when
his
daring
impulses
came
over
him
in
the
midst
of
the
din
he
went
straight
up
to
the
bull
and
before
it
moved
zas
he
stuck
in
the
banderillas
the
pair
were
out
of
place
and
badly
driven
in
one
of
them
fell
out
with
the
animal
start
of
surprise
but
this
did
not
signify
with
the
tolerance
that
a
crowd
always
has
for
its
idol
excusing
even
justifying
its
shortcomings
the
spectators
watched
this
daring
act
smilingly
gallardo
rendered
still
more
audacious
took
a
second
pair
of
banderillas
and
stuck
them
in
regardless
of
the
warnings
of
those
who
feared
for
his
life
this
feat
he
repeated
a
third
time
badly
but
with
such
dash
that
what
would
have
provoked
hisses
for
another
produced
only
explosions
of
admiration
for
him
what
a
man
how
luck
helped
that
fearless
man
the
bull
carried
four
banderillas
instead
of
six
and
those
were
so
feebly
planted
that
it
scarcely
seemed
to
feel
the
discomfort
he
is
still
fresh
shouted
the
aficionados
from
the
benches
alluding
to
the
bull
while
gallardo
with
his
montero
on
his
head
grasping
rapier
and
muleta
in
his
hands
advanced
towards
him
proud
and
calm
trusting
to
his
lucky
star
out
all
of
you
he
cried
again
he
turned
his
head
feeling
that
some
one
was
remaining
close
to
him
regardless
of
his
orders
it
was
fuentes
a
few
steps
behind
him
who
had
followed
him
with
his
cloak
on
his
arm
pretending
not
to
have
heard
but
ready
to
rush
to
his
assistance
as
if
he
foresaw
some
accident
leave
me
antonio
said
gallardo
half
angrily
and
yet
respectfully
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
an
elder
brother
his
manner
was
such
that
fuentes
shrugged
his
shoulders
disclaiming
all
responsibility
turning
his
back
he
moved
slowly
away
certain
that
he
would
be
suddenly
required
gallardo
spread
his
cloth
on
the
very
head
of
the
wild
beast
which
at
once
attacked
it
a
pass
olé
roared
the
enthusiasts
the
animal
turned
suddenly
throwing
itself
again
on
the
torero
with
a
violent
toss
of
its
head
that
tore
the
muleta
out
of
his
hand
finding
himself
disarmed
and
attacked
he
was
obliged
to
run
for
the
barrier
but
at
this
instant
fuentes
cloak
diverted
the
animal
charge
gallardo
who
guessed
during
his
flight
the
cause
of
the
bull
sudden
distraction
did
not
leap
the
barrier
but
sat
on
the
step
and
there
remained
some
moments
watching
his
enemy
a
few
paces
off
his
flight
ended
in
applause
of
this
display
of
calmness
he
recovered
his
muleta
and
rapier
carefully
the
red
cloth
and
once
again
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
brute
head
but
this
time
not
so
calmly
the
lust
of
slaughter
dominated
him
an
intense
desire
to
kill
as
soon
as
possible
the
animal
which
had
forced
him
to
fly
in
the
sight
of
thousands
of
admirers
he
scarcely
moved
a
step
thinking
that
the
decisive
moment
had
come
he
squared
himself
the
muleta
low
and
the
pommel
of
the
rapier
raised
to
his
eyes
again
the
audience
protested
fearing
for
his
life
do
strike
stop
an
exclamation
of
horror
shook
the
whole
plaza
a
spasm
which
made
all
rise
to
their
feet
their
eyes
starting
whilst
the
women
hid
their
faces
or
convulsively
clutched
at
the
arm
nearest
them
as
the
matador
struck
the
sword
glanced
on
a
bone
this
mischance
retarded
his
escape
and
caught
by
one
of
the
horns
he
was
hooked
up
by
the
middle
of
his
body
and
despite
his
weight
and
strength
of
muscle
this
man
was
lifted
was
twirled
about
on
its
point
like
a
helpless
dummy
until
the
powerful
beast
with
a
toss
of
its
head
sent
him
flying
several
yards
away
the
torero
fell
with
a
thump
on
the
sand
with
his
limbs
spread
wide
apart
just
like
a
frog
dressed
up
in
silk
and
gold
it
has
killed
him
he
is
gored
in
the
stomach
they
yelled
from
the
seats
but
gallardo
picked
himself
up
from
among
the
medley
of
cloaks
and
men
which
rushed
to
his
rescue
with
a
smile
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
body
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
show
he
was
not
hurt
nothing
but
the
force
of
the
blow
and
a
sash
in
rags
the
horn
had
only
torn
the
strong
silk
belt
he
turned
to
pick
up
his
killing
weapons
none
of
the
spectators
sat
down
as
they
guessed
that
the
next
encounter
would
be
brief
and
terrible
gallardo
advanced
towards
the
bull
with
a
reckless
excitement
as
if
he
discredited
the
powers
of
its
horns
now
he
had
emerged
unhurt
he
was
determined
to
kill
or
to
die
there
must
be
neither
delay
nor
precautions
it
must
be
either
the
bull
or
himself
he
saw
everything
red
just
as
if
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
he
only
heard
like
a
distant
sound
from
the
other
world
the
shouts
of
the
people
who
implored
him
to
keep
calm
he
only
made
two
passes
with
the
help
of
a
cloak
which
lay
near
him
and
then
suddenly
quick
as
thought
like
a
spring
released
from
its
catch
he
threw
himself
on
the
bull
planting
a
thrust
as
his
admirers
said
like
lightning
he
thrust
his
arm
in
so
far
that
as
he
drew
back
from
between
the
horns
one
of
them
grazed
him
sending
him
staggering
several
steps
but
he
kept
his
feet
and
the
bull
after
a
mad
rush
fell
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
plaza
with
its
legs
doubled
beneath
it
and
its
poll
touching
the
sand
until
the
puntillero
came
to
give
the
final
dagger
thrust
the
crowd
seemed
to
go
off
its
head
with
delight
a
splendid
corrida
all
were
surfeited
with
excitement
that
man
gallardo
did
steal
their
cash
he
paid
back
their
entrance
money
with
interest
the
aficionados
would
have
enough
to
keep
them
talking
for
three
days
at
their
evening
meetings
in
the
café
what
a
brave
fellow
what
a
savage
and
the
most
enthusiastic
looked
all
around
them
in
a
fever
of
pugnacity
to
find
anyone
that
disagreed
with
them
he
the
finest
matador
in
the
world
if
anyone
dares
to
deny
it
i
here
ready
for
him
the
rest
of
the
corrida
scarcely
attracted
any
attention
it
all
seemed
insipid
and
colourless
after
gallardo
great
feats
when
the
last
bull
fell
in
the
arena
a
swarm
of
boys
low
class
and
apprentices
invaded
the
circus
they
surrounded
gallardo
and
escorted
him
in
his
progress
from
the
president
chair
to
the
door
of
exit
they
pressed
round
him
anxious
to
shake
his
hands
or
even
to
touch
his
clothes
till
finally
the
wildest
spirits
regardless
of
the
blows
of
el
nacional
and
the
other
banderilleros
seized
the
maestro
by
the
legs
and
hoisting
him
on
their
shoulders
carried
him
in
triumph
round
the
circus
and
galleries
as
far
as
the
outbuildings
of
the
plaza
gallardo
raising
his
montero
saluted
the
groups
who
cheered
his
progress
with
his
gorgeous
cape
around
him
he
let
himself
be
carried
like
a
god
erect
and
motionless
above
the
sea
of
cordovan
hats
and
madrid
caps
whence
issued
enthusiastic
rounds
of
cheers
when
he
was
seated
in
his
carriage
passing
down
the
calle
de
alcala
hailed
by
the
crowds
who
had
not
seen
the
corrida
but
who
had
already
heard
of
his
triumphs
a
smile
of
pride
of
delight
in
his
own
strength
illuminated
his
face
perspiring
and
pale
with
excitement
el
nacional
still
anxious
about
his
master
accident
and
terrible
fall
asked
if
he
was
in
pain
and
whether
doctor
ruiz
should
be
summoned
no
it
was
only
a
caress
nothing
more
the
bull
that
can
kill
me
is
not
born
yet
but
as
though
in
the
midst
of
his
pride
some
remembrance
of
his
former
weakness
had
surged
up
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
sarcastic
gleam
in
el
nacional
eye
he
added
those
feelings
come
over
me
before
i
go
to
the
plaza
something
like
women
fancies
you
are
not
far
wrong
sebastian
what
your
saying
god
nature
that
it
neither
god
nature
meddle
with
affairs
every
one
comes
out
of
it
as
best
he
can
by
his
own
skill
or
his
own
courage
there
is
no
protection
to
be
had
from
either
earth
or
heaven
you
have
talents
sebastian
you
ought
to
have
studied
for
a
profession
in
the
optimism
of
his
triumph
he
regarded
the
banderillero
as
a
sage
quite
forgetting
the
laughter
with
which
at
other
times
he
had
always
greeted
his
very
involved
reasonings
on
arriving
at
his
lodging
he
found
a
crowd
of
admirers
in
the
lobby
waiting
to
embrace
him
his

ii
when
the
husband
of
señora
angustias
died
the
señor
juan
gallardo
an
excellent
cobbler
long
established
under
a
doorway
in
the
suburb
de
la
feria
she
wept
as
disconsolately
as
was
appropriate
to
the
event
but
at
the
same
time
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
felt
the
comfort
of
one
who
rests
after
a
long
march
and
lays
down
an
overwhelming
burden
poor
dear
soul
god
has
him
in
his
glory
so
good
so
hard
working
during
the
twenty
years
of
their
life
together
he
had
not
given
her
more
troubles
than
those
endured
by
the
other
women
in
the
suburb
of
the
three
pesetas
that
one
day
with
another
he
earned
by
his
work
he
gave
one
to
the
señora
angustias
for
the
maintenance
of
the
house
and
the
family
reserving
the
other
two
for
the
of
his
own
person
and
the
expenses
of
the
representacions
he
must
respond
to
the
civilities
of
his
friends
when
they
invited
him
to
drink
a
glass
and
the
wine
of
andalusia
although
it
is
the
glory
of
god
costs
dear
besides
he
must
inevitably
go
to
the
for
a
man
who
neither
drinks
nor
attends
corridas
why
is
he
in
the
world
at
all
the
señora
angustias
left
with
her
two
children
encarnacion
and
juan
had
to
sharpen
her
wits
and
develop
a
multiplicity
of
talents
to
carry
the
family
along
she
worked
as
charwoman
in
the
wealthiest
houses
in
the
suburb
sewed
for
the
neighbours
mended
clothes
and
laces
for
a
certain
pawnbroking
friend
of
hers
made
cigarettes
for
gentlemen
availing
herself
of
the
dexterity
acquired
in
her
youth
when
the
señor
juan
an
ardent
and
wheedling
lover
used
to
wait
for
her
at
the
entrance
of
the
tobacco
factory
she
never
had
to
complain
of
infidelities
or
bad
treatment
on
the
part
of
the
defunct
on
saturdays
when
he
returned
to
the
house
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
tipsy
supported
by
his
friends
happiness
and
tenderness
came
with
him
the
señora
angustias
was
obliged
forcibly
to
push
him
in
for
he
persisted
in
remaining
at
the
door
clapping
his
hands
and
chanting
doleful
love
songs
in
a
drivelling
voice
all
in
praise
of
his
voluminous
companion
and
when
at
last
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
and
the
neighbours
deprived
of
a
source
of
amusement
the
señor
juan
in
the
fullness
of
his
drunken
sentimentality
would
insist
on
seeing
the
little
ones
kissing
them
and
wetting
them
with
huge
tears
all
the
while
chanting
his
love
songs
in
honour
of
the
señora
angustias
olé
the
best
woman
in
the
world
and
the
good
woman
ended
by
relaxing
her
frown
and
laughing
while
she
undressed
him
and
petted
him
like
a
sick
child
this
was
his
only
vice
poor
dear
of
women
or
gambling
there
was
never
a
sign
his
selfishness
in
going
well
dressed
while
his
family
were
in
rags
and
the
inequality
in
the
division
of
the
proceeds
of
his
work
were
compensated
for
by
generous
treats
the
señora
angustias
remembered
with
pride
how
on
the
great
holidays
juan
made
her
put
on
her
manila
silk
shawl
the
wedding
mantilla
and
with
the
children
in
front
walked
by
her
side
in
a
white
cordovan
sombrero
with
a
silver
headed
stick
taking
a
turn
through
las
delicias
looking
just
like
a
family
of
tradespeople
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
on
the
days
of
cheap
he
would
treat
her
magnificently
before
going
to
the
plaza
offering
her
a
glass
of
manzanilla
in
la
campana
or
in
a
café
of
the
plaza
nueva
this
happy
time
was
now
nothing
but
a
faded
though
pleasant
recollection
in
the
poor
woman
memory
señor
juan
became
ill
of
consumption
and
for
two
years
his
wife
had
to
nurse
him
working
harder
than
ever
at
her
various
jobs
to
make
up
for
the
peseta
that
her
husband
formerly
gave
her
finally
he
died
in
the
hospital
resigned
to
his
fate
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
life
was
worth
nothing
without
bulls
and
manzanilla
his
last
looks
of
love
and
gratitude
were
for
his
wife
as
though
he
were
crying
out
with
his
eyes
olé
the
best
woman
in
the
world
when
the
señora
angustias
was
left
alone
her
situation
became
no
worse
on
the
contrary
she
was
much
less
hampered
in
her
movements
freed
from
the
man
who
in
the
last
two
years
of
his
life
had
weighed
more
heavily
on
her
than
all
the
rest
of
the
family
being
a
woman
of
prompt
and
energetic
action
she
immediately
struck
out
a
line
for
her
children
encarnacion
who
was
now
seventeen
went
to
the
tobacco
factory
where
her
mother
was
able
to
introduce
her
thanks
to
her
relations
with
certain
friends
of
her
youth
who
were
now
overseers
juanillo
who
from
his
babyhood
had
spent
his
days
under
the
doorway
in
the
suburb
de
la
feria
watching
his
father
work
should
become
a
shoemaker
by
the
will
of
señora
angustias
she
took
him
away
from
school
where
he
had
only
learnt
to
read
very
badly
and
at
twelve
years
old
he
was
apprenticed
to
one
of
the
best
shoemakers
in
seville
now
commenced
the
martyrdom
of
the
poor
woman
ay
that
urchin
the
son
of
such
honoured
parents
almost
every
day
instead
of
going
to
his
master
shop
he
would
go
to
the
with
certain
ragamuffins
who
had
their
meeting
place
on
a
bench
in
the
alameda
de
hercules
and
for
the
amusement
of
shepherds
and
slaughtermen
would
venture
to
throw
a
cloak
before
the
oxen
frequently
getting
knocked
over
and
trampled
the
señora
angustias
who
watched
many
nights
needle
in
hand
so
that
her
son
should
go
decently
clad
to
the
workshop
in
clean
clothes
would
find
him
at
the
house
door
afraid
to
come
in
but
from
the
extremity
of
his
hunger
equally
afraid
to
run
away
with
his
trousers
torn
his
jacket
filthy
and
bruises
and
grazes
on
his
face
to
the
bruises
of
the
treacherous
oxen
would
be
added
his
mother
blows
and
beatings
with
a
broomstick
but
the
hero
of
the
endured
everything
as
long
as
he
could
get
his
poor
pittance
beat
me
but
give
me
something
to
eat
and
with
an
appetite
sharpened
by
the
violent
exercise
he
would
swallow
the
hard
bread
the
weevilled
beans
the
putrefied
salt
cod
all
the
damaged
goods
that
the
thrifty
woman
found
in
the
shops
which
enabled
her
to
maintain
the
family
on
very
little
money
busy
all
day
scrubbing
the
floors
of
other
people
houses
it
was
only
now
and
again
in
the
evenings
that
she
was
able
to
look
after
her
son
going
to
his
master
shop
to
enquire
about
the
apprentice
progress
when
she
returned
from
the
shoemaker
she
was
usually
panting
with
rage
promising
herself
to
administer
the
most
stupendous
punishments
in
order
to
correct
the
rascal
on
most
days
he
never
went
near
the
shop
at
all
he
spent
the
mornings
at
the
and
in
the
evenings
formed
one
of
a
group
of
other
vagabonds
at
the
entrance
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
prowling
round
the
groups
of
toreros
without
contracts
who
assembled
in
la
campana
dressed
in
new
clothes
with
spick
and
span
hats
and
scarcely
a
peseta
between
them
in
their
pockets
each
one
boasting
of
his
own
imaginary
exploits
juanillo
viewed
them
as
creatures
of
amazing
superiority
he
envied
their
fine
carriage
and
the
coolness
with
which
they
ogled
the
women
the
idea
that
each
one
of
those
men
had
in
his
house
a
set
of
silk
clothes
embroidered
with
gold
and
being
dressed
in
these
would
march
past
before
the
crowd
to
the
sound
of
music
produced
a
shiver
of
respect
the
son
of
señora
angustias
was
known
to
all
his
ragged
companions
as
zapaterin
and
he
seemed
delighted
at
having
a
nickname
like
almost
all
the
great
men
who
appeared
in
the
circus
everything
must
have
a
beginning
round
his
neck
he
wore
a
red
handkerchief
filched
from
his
sister
and
from
beneath
his
cap
the
hair
fell
over
his
ears
in
long
locks
which
he
smoothed
with
saliva
he
wanted
to
have
his
drill
blouses
made
short
to
the
waist
with
many
pleats
his
trousers
old
remains
of
his
father
wardrobe
high
in
the
waist
full
in
the
legs
well
fitting
over
the
hips
and
he
wept
with
humiliation
when
his
mother
would
not
give
in
to
these
requirements
a
cape
oh
to
possess
a
fighting
cape
not
to
have
to
implore
the
loan
of
the
coveted
garment
for
a
few
moments
from
others
more
fortunate
than
himself
in
a
small
room
in
their
house
lay
an
old
empty
mattress
from
which
señora
angustias
had
sold
the
wool
in
days
of
distress
the
zapaterin
spent
one
morning
shut
up
in
that
room
taking
advantage
of
his
mother
absence
who
was
working
that
day
at
a
canon
house
with
the
ingenuity
of
a
man
left
to
his
own
resources
on
a
desert
island
who
has
to
make
everything
for
himself
he
cut
out
a
fighting
cape
from
the
damp
and
ravelled
linen
afterwards
he
boiled
in
a
pipkin
a
handful
of
red
aniline
which
he
had
bought
at
a
druggists
and
dipped
the
old
linen
in
the
dye
then
juanillo
looked
at
the
result
of
his
work
a
cape
of
the
most
brilliant
scarlet
which
would
arouse
many
envies
at
the
capeas
in
different
villages
it
only
wanted
drying
so
he
hung
it
in
the
sun
among
the
neighbours
white
clothes
the
wind
waving
the
dripping
rag
spotted
the
neighbouring
garments
and
a
chorus
of
maledictions
and
threats
of
clenched
fists
and
mouths
uttering
the
most
abusive
words
against
him
and
his
mother
obliged
the
zapaterin
to
seize
his
cape
of
glory
and
bolt
his
hands
and
face
covered
with
red
as
if
he
had
just
committed
a
murder
the
señora
angustias
was
a
strong
woman
obese
and
mustachioed
who
feared
no
man
and
compelled
respect
from
other
women
by
her
energetic
determination
but
with
her
son
she
was
weak
and
what
could
she
do
she
had
laid
violent
hands
on
every
part
of
the
body
and
broom
sticks
had
been
broken
with
no
apparent
result
that
cursed
one
said
she
had
the
hide
of
a
dog
accustomed
out
of
the
house
to
the
tremendous
butting
of
the
calves
the
cruel
tramplings
of
the
cows
to
the
sticks
of
the
herdsmen
and
slaughtermen
who
thrashed
the
tauric
aspirants
without
mercy
his
mother
blows
seemed
a
natural
event
a
continuation
of
his
life
prolonged
into
his
family
life
which
he
accepted
without
the
slightest
intention
of
amendment
as
a
fine
he
had
to
pay
in
return
for
food
so
he
gnawed
the
hard
bread
with
starving
gluttony
while
the
maternal
blows
and
maledictions
rained
on
his
shoulders
as
soon
as
his
hunger
was
satisfied
he
ran
away
from
the
house
availing
himself
of
the
liberty
perforce
left
by
señora
angustias
who
was
absent
busy
at
her
tasks
in
la
campana
the
venerable
agora
of
tauric
gossip
where
all
the
great
news
of
the
aficion
circulated
he
got
tidings
from
his
friends
which
made
him
tremble
with
delight
zapaterin
there
is
a
corrida
the
country
villages
celebrated
the
of
their
patron
saint
by
capeas
of
already
tried
bulls
and
there
the
young
toreros
walked
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
say
on
their
return
that
they
had
spread
their
cloaks
in
the
celebrated
plazas
of
aznalcollar
bollullos
or
mairena
they
would
begin
their
journey
at
night
with
their
cloaks
over
their
shoulders
if
it
were
summer
or
wrapped
round
them
if
it
were
winter
their
stomachs
empty
talking
all
the
time
of
bulls
if
their
tramp
lasted
several
days
they
would
camp
on
the
ground
or
be
admitted
out
of
charity
to
the
of
some
inn
alas
for
the
grapes
the
melons
and
the
figs
they
came
across
on
their
way
in
the
warm
season
their
only
anxiety
was
lest
some
other
party
some
other
cuadrilla
should
have
had
the
same
inspiration
and
would
arrive
in
the
town
before
them
thus
establishing
a
rough
competition
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
their
journey
their
brows
dusty
and
their
mouths
parched
tired
and
foot
weary
from
the
tramp
they
presented
themselves
before
the
alcalde
and
the
boldest
among
them
who
fulfilled
the
functions
of
director
spoke
of
the
merits
of
the
troup
who
thought
themselves
lucky
if
municipal
generosity
lodged
them
in
the
inn
stables
and
gave
them
in
addition
an
olla
which
was
emptied
in
a
few
seconds
in
the
square
of
the
town
enclosed
with
carts
and
boarded
scaffolding
old
bulls
would
be
loosed
veritable
castles
of
flesh
covered
with
seams
and
scars
with
enormous
sharp
horns
brutes
that
for
many
years
had
been
baited
at
all
the
holidays
in
the
province
venerable
animals
who
knew
latin
their
cunning
was
so
great
that
accustomed
to
the
perpetual
baiting
they
were
in
the
secrets
of
all
the
possibilities
of
the
fight
the
boys
of
the
town
pricked
these
beasts
from
a
safe
place
and
the
people
derived
more
amusement
from
the
toreros
from
seville
even
than
from
the
bull
the
youngsters
spread
their
cloaks
with
trembling
legs
but
their
hearts
comforted
by
the
weight
in
their
stomachs
there
was
great
delight
among
the
crowd
when
any
one
of
them
was
knocked
over
and
when
any
lad
among
them
in
sudden
terror
took
refuge
behind
the
palisades
the
peasant
barbarians
received
him
with
insults
striking
the
hands
clutching
hold
of
the
wood
and
thrashing
him
on
the
legs
to
make
him
jump
again
into
the
plaza
arre
coward
show
your
face
to
the
bull
cheat
sometimes
one
of
the
diestros
would
be
carried
out
of
the
plaza
by
four
of
his
companions
pale
with
the
whiteness
of
paper
his
eyes
glassy
his
head
hanging
and
his
breast
heaving
like
a
broken
bellows
the
barber
would
arrive
reassuring
them
all
as
he
saw
no
blood
it
was
only
the
shock
the
lad
had
suffered
in
being
tossed
to
a
distance
of
several
yards
and
falling
on
the
ground
like
a
bundle
of
clothes
at
other
times
it
was
the
agony
of
being
trampled
under
foot
by
some
enormously
heavy
animal
then
a
pail
of
water
would
be
dashed
on
his
head
and
when
he
recovered
his
senses
he
would
be
treated
to
a
long
draught
of
aguardiente
from
cazalla
de
la
sierra
not
even
a
prince
could
be
better
cared
for
and
back
he
went
to
the
plaza
again
when
the
grazier
had
no
more
bulls
to
loose
and
night
was
beginning
to
fall
two
of
the
cuadrilla
choosing
the
best
cloak
of
the
company
and
holding
it
by
the
corners
would
go
from
stand
to
stand
asking
for
some
gratuity
copper
money
would
rain
into
the
red
cloth
according
to
the
amusement
the
strangers
had
given
to
the
inhabitants
and
the
corrida
being
ended
they
would
recommence
their
tramp
home
knowing
their
credit
at
the
inn
was
exhausted
very
often
on
the
way
home
they
quarrelled
over
the
division
of
the
coins
which
were
carried
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
all
the
rest
of
the
week
would
be
spent
narrating
their
exploits
before
the
wide
open
eyes
of
the
chums
who
had
not
been
of
the
expedition
they
would
tell
of
their
veronicas
in
el
garrobo
of
their
navarras
in
lora
or
of
a
terrible
goring
in
el
pedroso
imitating
the
airs
and
attitudes
of
the
true
professionals
who
a
few
steps
away
from
them
were
consoling
themselves
for
their
failure
to
get
contracts
by
every
sort
of
bragging
and
lies
on
one
occasion
the
señora
angustias
was
more
than
a
week
without
news
of
her
son
at
last
vague
rumours
came
that
he
had
been
wounded
in
a
capea
at
the
village
of
tocino
dios
mio
where
might
that
village
be
how
should
she
get
to
it
she
made
sure
her
son
was
dead
and
wept
for
him
nevertheless
she
wished
to
go
to
the
place
herself
while
however
she
was
considering
the
journey
juanillo
arrived
pale
and
weak
but
speaking
with
manly
pride
of
his
accident
it
was
nothing
a
prick
in
the
buttock
which
with
the
shamelessness
born
of
his
triumph
he
wished
to
show
to
all
the
neighbours
declaring
that
he
could
put
his
finger
in
several
inches
without
its
coming
to
the
end
he
was
proud
of
the
smell
of
iodoform
which
he
dispersed
as
he
passed
and
he
spoke
gratefully
of
the
attentions
which
had
been
paid
to
him
in
that
town
which
according
to
him
was
the
finest
in
all
spain
the
richest
people
there
the
aristocracy
as
one
might
say
were
interested
in
his
mishap
and
the
alcalde
had
been
to
see
him
afterwards
giving
him
his
return
fare
he
still
had
three
duros
in
his
purse
which
he
made
over
to
his
mother
with
the
air
of
a
grand
gentleman
so
much
fame
at
fourteen
his
pride
was
all
the
greater
when
in
la
campana
several
toreros
real
toreros
deigned
to
take
notice
of
him
enquiring
how
his
wound
was
getting
on
after
this
accident
he
never
again
returned
to
his
master
shop
he
knew
now
what
bulls
were
and
his
wound
only
served
to
increase
his
boldness
he
would
be
a
torero
and
nothing
but
a
torero
the
señora
angustias
abandoned
all
her
projects
of
correction
judging
them
to
be
useless
she
tried
to
ignore
her
son
existence
when
he
arrived
home
at
night
at
the
time
his
mother
and
sister
were
supping
together
they
gave
him
his
food
in
silence
intending
to
crush
him
with
their
contempt
but
this
in
no
way
interfered
with
his
appetite
if
he
arrived
late
they
did
not
even
keep
a
scrap
of
bread
for
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
go
out
again
as
empty
as
he
had
come
in
he
was
one
of
the
evening
promenaders
in
the
alameda
de
hercules
with
other
lads
a
confused
mixture
of
apprentices
criminals
and
toreros
the
neighbours
met
him
sometimes
in
the
streets
talking
to
young
gentlemen
whose
airs
made
the
women
laugh
or
grave
caballeros
to
whom
slander
gave
feminine
nicknames
sometimes
he
would
sell
newspapers
or
during
the
great
festivals
of
holy
week
he
would
sell
packets
of
caramels
in
the
plaza
de
san
francisco
at
the
time
of
the
fair
he
would
loiter
about
the
hotels
waiting
for
an
englishman
because
for
him
all
travellers
were
english
hoping
to
be
engaged
as
guide
milord
i
am
a
torero
he
would
say
seeing
a
foreign
figure
as
if
this
professional
qualification
was
an
undeniable
recommendation
to
strangers
in
order
to
establish
his
identity
he
would
take
off
his
cap
letting
the
pigtail
fall
down
behind
the
long
lock
of
hair
which
as
a
rule
he
wore
rolled
up
on
the
top
of
his
head
his
companion
in
wretchedness
was
chiripa
a
lad
of
the
same
age
small
of
body
and
malicious
of
eye
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
and
had
wandered
about
seville
ever
since
he
could
remember
anything
he
exercised
over
juanillo
all
the
influence
of
greater
experience
he
had
one
cheek
scarred
by
a
bull
horn
and
this
visible
wound
the
zapaterin
considered
greatly
superior
to
his
invisible
one
when
at
the
door
of
an
hotel
some
lady
bitten
by
the
idea
of
local
colour
spoke
with
the
young
toreros
admired
their
listened
to
the
stories
of
their
exploits
and
ended
by
giving
them
some
money
chiripa
would
say
in
a
whining
voice
do
not
give
it
to
him
he
has
a
mother
and
i
am
alone
in
the
world
he
who
has
a
mother
does
not
know
what
he
has
and
the
zapaterin
seized
with
a
feeling
of
compunction
would
allow
the
other
lad
to
take
possession
of
all
the
money
murmuring
that
is
true
that
is
true
this
filial
tenderness
did
not
prevent
juanillo
continuing
his
abnormal
existence
only
putting
in
an
occasional
appearance
at
señora
house
and
often
undertaking
long
journeys
away
from
seville
chiripa
was
a
past
master
of
a
vagabond
life
on
the
days
of
a
corrida
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
get
into
the
plaza
de
toros
somehow
with
his
comrade
and
would
employ
for
this
end
every
sort
of
stratagem
such
as
scaling
the
walls
slipping
in
among
the
people
unperceived
or
even
softening
the
officials
by
humble
prayers
a
fiesta
taurina
and
they
who
were
of
the
profession
not
there
to
see
it
when
there
were
no
capeas
in
the
provincial
towns
they
would
go
and
spread
their
cloaks
before
the
young
bulls
in
the
pastures
of
tablada
these
attractions
of
sevillian
life
however
were
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
their
ambition
chiripa
had
wandered
much
and
told
his
companion
of
all
the
things
he
had
seen
in
the
distant
provinces
he
was
expert
in
the
art
of
travelling
gratuitously
and
hiding
himself
cleverly
on
the
trains
the
zapaterin
listened
with
delight
to
his
description
of
madrid
that
city
of
dreams
with
its
which
was
a
kind
of
cathedral
of
one
day
a
gentleman
at
the
door
of
a
café
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
told
them
in
order
to
take
a
rise
out
of
them
that
they
might
earn
a
great
deal
of
money
in
bilbao
as
toreros
did
not
abound
there
as
they
did
in
seville
so
the
two
lads
undertook
the
journey
with
empty
purses
and
no
luggage
but
their
capes
real
capes
which
had
belonged
to
toreros
whose
names
figured
on
placards
and
bought
by
them
for
a
few
reals
in
an
old
clothes
shop
they
crept
cautiously
into
the
trains
hiding
themselves
beneath
the
seats
but
hunger
and
other
necessities
obliged
them
to
divulge
their
presence
to
their
fellow
travellers
who
ended
by
pitying
their
plight
laughing
at
the
queer
figures
they
cut
with
their
and
capes
and
finally
giving
them
the
remains
of
their
victuals
when
any
official
gave
chase
at
the
stations
they
would
run
from
carriage
to
carriage
or
try
to
climb
on
the
roofs
to
await
lying
flat
the
starting
of
the
train
many
times
they
were
caught
seized
by
the
ears
to
the
accompaniment
of
blows
and
kicks
and
left
standing
on
the
platform
of
a
lonely
station
to
watch
the
train
vanish
like
a
lost
hope
they
would
wait
for
the
passing
of
the
next
train
bivouacing
in
the
open
air
or
if
they
found
they
were
being
watched
would
start
to
walk
over
the
deserted
fields
to
the
next
station
in
the
hope
that
there
they
would
be
more
fortunate
and
so
they
arrived
at
madrid
after
an
adventurous
journey
of
many
days
with
long
waits
and
not
a
few
cuffs
in
the
calle
de
sevilla
and
the
puerta
del
sol
they
admired
the
groups
of
unemployed
toreros
superior
beings
from
whom
they
ventured
to
beg
without
any
result
a
little
alms
to
continue
their
journey
a
servant
of
the
plaza
de
toros
who
came
from
seville
had
pity
on
them
and
let
them
sleep
in
the
stables
procuring
them
further
the
delight
of
seeing
a
corrida
of
young
bulls
in
the
famous
circus
which
however
did
not
seem
to
them
as
imposing
as
the
one
in
their
own
country
frightened
at
their
own
daring
and
seeing
the
end
of
their
excursion
ever
further
and
further
off
they
decided
to
return
to
seville
in
the
same
way
that
they
had
come
but
from
that
time
they
took
a
pleasure
in
these
stolen
journeys
on
the
railway
they
travelled
to
many
places
of
small
importance
in
the
different
andalusian
provinces
whenever
they
heard
vague
rumours
of
fiestas
with
their
corresponding
capeas
in
this
way
they
travelled
as
far
as
la
mancha
and
estremadura
and
if
bad
luck
obliged
them
to
go
on
foot
they
took
refuge
in
the
hovels
of
the
peasants
credulous
people
who
were
astounded
at
their
youth
their
daring
and
their
bombastic
talk
and
took
them
for
real
toreros
this
wandering
existence
made
them
exercise
the
cunning
of
primitive
man
to
satisfy
their
wants
in
the
neighbourhood
of
country
houses
they
would
crawl
on
their
stomachs
to
steal
the
vegetables
without
being
seen
they
would
watch
whole
hours
for
a
solitary
hen
to
come
near
them
and
having
wrung
her
neck
would
proceed
on
their
tramp
to
light
a
fire
of
dry
wood
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
swallow
the
poor
bird
scorched
and
half
raw
with
the
voracity
of
little
savages
the
field
mastiffs
they
feared
more
than
bulls
these
watchdogs
were
difficult
brutes
to
fight
when
they
rushed
upon
the
boys
showing
their
fangs
as
if
the
strange
aspect
of
the
latter
infuriated
them
and
they
scented
enemies
to
personal
property
sometimes
when
they
were
sleeping
in
the
open
air
near
a
station
waiting
for
a
train
to
pass
a
couple
of
civil
guards
would
rouse
them
however
the
guardians
of
law
and
order
were
pacified
when
they
saw
the
red
cloth
bundles
which
served
these
vagabonds
as
pillows
very
civilly
they
would
take
off
the
urchins
caps
and
finding
the
hairy
appendage
of
the
they
would
move
off
laughing
and
make
no
further
enquiries
they
were
not
little
thieves
they
were
aficionados
going
to
the
capeas
in
this
tolerance
there
was
a
mixture
of
sympathy
for
the
national
pastime
and
respect
towards
the
obscurity
of
the
future
who
could
tell
if
perhaps
one
of
these
ragged
lads
with
poverty
stricken
exterior
might
not
become
in
the
future
a
star
of
the
art
a
great
man
who
would
pledge
bulls
to
kings
would
live
like
a
prince
and
whose
exploits
and
sayings
would
be
recorded
in
the
newspapers
at
last
an
evening
came
when
in
a
town
of
estremadura
the
zapaterin
found
himself
alone
in
order
the
more
to
astonish
the
rustic
audience
who
were
applauding
the
famous
toreros
come
purposely
from
seville
the
two
lads
thought
they
would
fix
banderillas
in
the
neck
of
an
old
and
very
tricky
bull
juanillo
had
fixed
his
darts
in
the
beast
neck
and
stood
near
a
staging
delighting
in
receiving
the
popular
ovation
which
expressed
itself
in
tremendous
thumps
on
his
back
and
offers
of
glasses
of
wine
an
exclamation
of
horror
startled
him
out
of
this
intoxication
of
triumph
chiripa
was
no
longer
standing
on
the
ground
of
the
plaza
nothing
remained
of
him
but
the
banderillas
rolling
on
the
ground
one
slipper
and
his
cap
the
bull
was
tossing
his
head
as
if
irritated
at
some
obstacle
carrying
impaled
on
one
of
his
horns
a
bundle
of
clothes
like
a
doll
by
violent
the
shapeless
bundle
was
flung
off
the
horn
pouring
out
a
red
stream
but
before
it
reached
the
ground
it
was
caught
by
the
other
horn
and
twirled
about
for
some
time
at
last
the
luckless
bundle
fell
into
the
dust
and
lay
there
limp
and
lifeless
pouring
out
blood
like
a
pierced
wine
skin
letting
out
the
wine
in
jets
the
grazier
with
his
bell
oxen
drew
the
brute
into
the
yard
for
no
one
dared
to
approach
him
and
the
unhappy
chiripa
was
carried
on
a
straw
mattress
to
a
room
in
the
town
hall
which
usually
served
as
a
prison
his
companion
saw
him
there
with
his
face
as
white
as
plaster
his
eyes
dull
and
his
body
red
with
blood
which
the
cloths
soaked
in
vinegar
applied
in
default
of
anything
better
were
unable
to
staunch
adio
zapaterin
he
sighed
adio
juaniyo
and
spoke
no
more
the
dead
lad
companion
quite
overcome
started
on
his
return
to
seville
haunted
by
those
glassy
eyes
hearing
those
moaning
farewells
he
was
afraid
a
quiet
cow
crossing
his
path
would
have
made
him
run
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
the
wisdom
of
her
advice
would
it
not
be
better
to
devote
himself
to
and
live
quietly
those
ideas
however
only
lasted
as
long
as
he
was
alone
on
arriving
in
seville
he
once
more
felt
the
influence
of
the
pervading
atmosphere
his
friends
surrounded
him
anxious
to
hear
every
detail
of
poor
chiripa
death
the
professional
toreros
enquired
about
it
in
la
campana
recalling
pitifully
the
little
rascal
with
the
scarred
face
who
had
run
so
many
errands
for
them
juan
fired
by
such
marks
of
consideration
gave
rein
to
his
powerful
imagination
and
described
how
he
had
thrown
himself
on
the
bull
when
he
saw
his
unlucky
companion
caught
how
he
had
seized
the
brute
by
the
tail
with
other
portentous
exploits
in
spite
of
which
poor
chiripa
had
made
his
exit
from
this
world
this
painful
impression
soon
disappeared
he
would
be
a
torero
and
nothing
but
a
torero
if
others
became
that
why
not
he
he
thought
of
the
weevilled
beans
and
his
mother
dry
bread
of
the
abuse
which
each
new
pair
of
trousers
drew
on
him
of
hunger
the
inseparable
companion
of
so
many
of
his
expeditions
besides
he
felt
a
vehement
longing
for
all
the
enjoyments
and
luxuries
of
life
he
looked
with
envy
at
the
coaches
and
horses
he
stood
absorbed
before
the
doorways
of
the
great
houses
through
whose
iron
wickets
he
could
see
of
oriental
luxury
with
arcades
of
moorish
tiles
floors
of
marble
and
murmuring
fountains
which
dropped
a
shower
of
pearls
day
and
night
over
basins
surrounded
by
green
leaves
his
fate
was
decided
he
would
kill
bulls
or
die
he
would
be
rich
so
that
the
newspapers
should
speak
of
him
and
people
bow
before
him
even
though
it
were
at
the
cost
of
his
life
he
despised
the
inferior
ranks
of
the
torero
he
saw
the
banderilleros
who
risked
their
lives
just
like
the
masters
of
the
profession
receive
thirty
duros
only
for
each
corrida
and
after
a
life
of
fatigues
and
gorings
with
no
future
for
their
old
age
but
some
wretched
little
shop
started
with
their
savings
or
some
employment
at
a
many
died
in
hospitals
the
majority
begged
for
charity
from
their
younger
companions
nothing
for
him
of
banderilleros
or
of
spending
many
years
in
a
cuadrilla
under
the
despotism
of
a
master
he
would
kill
bulls
from
the
first
and
tread
the
sand
of
the
plazas
as
an
espada
at
once
the
misfortune
of
poor
chiripa
gave
him
a
certain
ascendancy
among
his
companions
and
he
formed
a
cuadrilla
a
ragged
cuadrilla
who
tramped
after
him
to
the
capeas
in
the
villages
they
respected
him
because
he
was
the
bravest
and
the
best
dressed
several
girls
of
loose
life
attracted
by
the
manly
beauty
of
the
zapaterin
who
was
now
eighteen
and
also
by
the
prestige
of
his
quarrelled
among
themselves
in
noisy
rivalry
as
to
who
should
have
the
care
of
his
comely
person
added
to
this
he
now
reckoned
on
a
godfather
an
old
patron
and
former
magistrate
who
had
a
weakness
for
smart
young
toreros
but
whose
intimacy
with
her
son
made
señora
angustias
furious
and
caused
her
to
give
vent
to
all
the
most
obscene
expressions
she
had
learnt
while
she
was
at
the
tobacco
factory
the
zapaterin
wore
suits
of
english
woollen
cloth
well
fitted
to
his
elegant
figure
and
his
hats
were
always
spick
and
span
his
female
associates
looked
to
the
scrupulous
whiteness
of
his
collars
and
shirt
fronts
and
on
great
days
he
wore
over
his
waistcoat
a
double
chain
of
gold
like
ladies
wear
a
loan
from
his
respected
friend
which
had
already
figured
round
the
necks
of
several
youngsters
who
were
beginning
their
careers
he
now
mixed
with
the
real
toreros
and
he
could
afford
to
stand
treat
to
the
old
servants
who
remembered
the
exploits
of
the
famous
masters
it
was
rumoured
as
true
that
certain
patrons
were
working
in
favour
of
this
lad
and
were
only
waiting
for
a
propitious
occasion
for
his
début
at
the
baiting
of
novillos
in
the
plaza
of
seville
the
zapaterin
was
already
a
matador
one
day
at
lebrija
a
most
lively
bull
was
turned
into
the
arena
his
companions
egged
him
on
to
the
supreme
feat
do
you
dare
to
put
your
hand
to
him
and
he
did
put
his
hand
afterwards
emboldened
by
the
facility
with
which
he
had
come
out
of
the
peril
he
went
to
all
the
capeas
in
which
it
was
announced
that
the
novillos
would
be
killed
and
to
all
the
farm
houses
where
they
baited
and
killed
cattle
the
proprietor
of
la
rinconada
a
rich
grange
with
its
own
small
was
an
enthusiast
who
kept
the
table
laid
and
his
open
for
all
the
starving
aficionados
who
wished
to
amuse
themselves
fighting
his
cattle
juanillo
had
been
there
in
the
days
of
his
poverty
with
other
companions
to
eat
to
the
health
of
the
rural
hidalgo
they
would
arrive
on
foot
after
a
two
days
tramp
and
the
proprietor
seeing
the
dusty
troup
with
their
bundles
of
cloaks
would
say
solemnly
to
whoever
does
best
i
will
give
his
ticket
to
return
to
seville
by
train
the
master
of
the
farm
spent
two
days
smoking
in
the
balcony
of
his
plaza
whilst
the
youngsters
from
seville
fought
his
young
bulls
being
often
knocked
over
and
pawed
that
no
use
whatever
blunderer
he
would
cry
reproving
a
cloak
pass
ill
delivered
up
from
the
ground
coward
and
tell
them
to
give
you
some
wine
to
get
over
your
fright
he
would
shout
when
a
lad
continued
lying
full
length
on
the
ground
after
a
bull
had
passed
over
his
body
the
zapaterin
killed
a
novillo
so
much
to
the
taste
of
its
owner
that
the
latter
seated
him
at
his
own
table
while
his
comrades
remained
in
the
kitchen
with
the
shepherds
and
labourers
dipping
their
horn
spoons
into
the
common
steaming
pot
you
have
earned
your
journey
in
the
railway
gacho
you
will
go
far
if
your
heart
does
not
fail
you
you
have
capabilities
when
the
zapaterin
began
his
return
journey
to
seville
in
a
carriage
while
the
cuadrilla
commenced
theirs
on
foot
he
thought
a
new
life
was
opening
for
him
and
he
cast
looks
of
envy
on
the
enormous
grange
with
its
extensive
its
mills
its
pastures
which
lost
themselves
to
sight
on
which
thousands
of
goats
grazed
and
bulls
and
cows
ruminated
quietly
with
their
legs
tucked
under
them
what
wealth
if
he
could
only
some
day
arrive
at
possessing
something
similar
the
fame
of
his
prowess
in
baiting
the
young
bulls
in
the
villages
reached
seville
attracting
the
notice
of
some
of
the
restless
and
insatiable
amateurs
who
were
always
hoping
for
the
rise
of
a
new
star
to
eclipse
the
existing
ones
he
looks
a
promising
lad
they
said
seeing
him
pass
along
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
with
a
short
step
swinging
his
arms
proudly
we
shall
have
to
see
him
on
the
ground
this
ground
for
them
and
for
the
zapaterin
was
the
circus
of
the
plaza
of
seville
the
youngster
was
soon
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
truth
his
protector
had
acquired
for
him
a
gala
dress
a
little
used
the
finery
of
some
nameless
matador
a
corrida
of
novillos
was
being
organized
for
some
charitable
purpose
and
some
influential
amateurs
anxious
for
novelty
succeeded
in
including
him
in
the
programme
gratuitously
as
matador
the
son
of
señora
angustias
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
announced
on
the
placards
by
his
nickname
of
zapaterin
which
he
wished
to
forget
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
nicknames
still
less
with
any
subordinate
employment
he
wished
to
be
known
by
his
father
names
he
intended
to
be
juan
gallardo
and
that
no
nickname
should
remind
the
great
people
who
in
the
future
would
indubitably
be
his
friends
of
his
low
origin
all
the
suburb
of
la
feria
rushed
en
masse
to
the
corrida
with
turbulent
and
patriotic
ardour
those
of
la
macarena
also
showed
their
interest
and
all
the
other
workmen
suburbs
were
roused
to
the
same
enthusiasm
a
new
sevillian
matador
there
were
not
places
enough
for
all
and
thousands
of
people
remained
outside
anxiously
awaiting
news
of
the
corrida
gallardo
baited
killed
was
rolled
over
by
a
bull
without
being
wounded
keeping
his
audience
on
tenter
hooks
with
his
audacities
which
in
most
cases
turned
out
luckily
provoking
immense
howls
of
enthusiasm
certain
amateurs
whose
opinions
were
worthy
of
respect
smiled
complacently
he
still
had
a
great
deal
to
learn
but
he
had
courage
and
goodwill
which
is
the
most
important
thing
above
all
he
goes
in
to
kill
truly
and
he
is
at
last
on
the
true
ground
during
the
corrida
the
girls
friends
of
the
diestro
rushed
about
frantic
with
enthusiasm
with
hysterical
contortions
tearful
eyes
and
slobbering
mouths
making
use
in
broad
daylight
of
all
the
loving
words
they
generally
kept
for
night
one
flung
her
cloak
into
the
arena
another
to
go
one
better
her
blouse
and
her
stays
another
tore
off
her
skirt
till
the
spectators
seized
hold
of
them
laughing
fearing
they
would
throw
themselves
next
into
the
arena
or
remain
in
their
shifts
on
the
other
side
of
the
plaza
the
old
magistrate
smiled
tenderly
under
his
white
beard
admiring
the
youngster
courage
and
thinking
how
well
the
gala
dress
became
him
on
seeing
him
rolled
over
by
the
bull
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
seat
as
if
he
were
fainting
that
was
too
much
for
him
between
the
barriers
encarnacion
husband
strutted
with
pride
he
was
a
saddler
with
a
small
open
shop
a
prudent
man
detesting
vagrancy
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
cigarette
maker
charms
and
married
her
but
on
the
express
condition
of
having
nothing
to
do
with
that
bad
lot
her
brother
gallardo
offended
by
his
sour
face
had
never
attempted
to
set
foot
in
his
shop
situated
on
the
outskirts
of
la
macarena
neither
had
he
ever
ceased
to
use
the
ceremonious
uste
when
he
met
him
sometimes
in
the
evening
at
señora
angustias
house
i
am
going
to
see
how
they
will
pelt
that
vagabond
brother
of
yours
with
oranges
to
make
him
run
he
had
said
to
his
wife
as
he
left
for
the
plaza
but
now
from
his
seat
he
was
applauding
the
diestro
shouting
to
him
as
juaniyo
calling
him
tu
peacocking
with
delight
when
the
youngster
attracted
by
the
shouting
at
last
saw
him
and
replied
with
a
wave
of
his
rapier
he
is
my
explained
the
saddler
in
order
to
attract
the
attention
of
those
around
him
i
have
always
thought
that
youngster
would
be
something
in
the
line
my
wife
and
i
have
helped
him
a
great
deal
the
exit
was
triumphal
the
crowd
threw
themselves
on
juanillo
as
if
they
intended
to
devour
him
in
their
expansive
delight
it
was
a
mercy
his
was
there
to
restore
order
to
cover
him
with
his
body
and
conduct
him
to
the
hired
carriage
in
which
he
finally
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
novillero
when
they
arrived
at
the
little
house
in
the
suburb
of
la
feria
an
immense
crowd
followed
the
carriage
and
like
all
popular
manifestations
they
were
shouting
vivas
which
made
the
inhabitants
run
to
their
doors
the
news
of
his
triumph
had
arrived
before
the
diestro
and
all
the
neighbours
ran
to
look
at
him
and
shake
his
hand
the
señora
angustias
and
her
daughter
were
standing
at
the
house
door
the
saddler
almost
lifted
his
out
in
his
arms
monopolizing
him
shouting
and
gesticulating
in
the
name
of
the
family
to
prevent
anyone
touching
him
as
though
he
were
a
sick
man
here
he
is
encarnacion
he
said
pushing
him
towards
his
wife
he
is
the
real
roger
de
flor
encarnacion
did
not
need
to
ask
any
more
for
she
knew
that
her
husband
as
a
result
of
some
far
off
and
confused
reading
considered
this
historic
personage
as
the
embodiment
of
all
greatness
and
only
ventured
to
join
his
name
to
portentous
events
other
neighbours
who
had
come
from
the
corrida
insinuatingly
flattered
señora
angustias
as
they
looked
admiringly
at
her
portly
figure
blessed
be
the
mother
who
bore
so
brave
a
son
the
poor
woman
eyes
wore
an
expression
of
bewilderment
and
doubt
could
it
be
really
her
juanillo
who
was
making
everyone
run
about
so
enthusiastically
had
they
all
gone
mad
but
suddenly
she
threw
herself
upon
him
as
if
all
the
past
had
vanished
as
if
her
sorrows
and
rages
were
a
dream
as
if
she
were
confessing
to
a
shameful
error
her
enormous
flabby
arms
were
flung
round
the
torero
neck
and
tears
wetted
one
of
his
cheeks
my
son
juaniyo
if
your
poor
father
could
see
you
do
cry
mother
for
this
is
a
happy
day
you
will
see
if
god
gives
me
luck
i
will
build
you
a
house
and
your
friends
shall
see
you
in
a
carriage
and
you
shall
wear
a
manila
shawl
which
will
make
everyone
the
saddler
acknowledged
those
promises
of
grandeur
with
affirmative
nods
standing
opposite
his
bewildered
wife
who
had
not
yet
got
over
her
surprise
at
this
radical
change
yes
encarnacion
this
youngster
can
do
everything
if
he
takes
the
trouble
he
was
extraordinary
the
real
roger
de
flor
himself
that
night
in
the
taverns
of
the
people
suburbs
nothing
was
talked
of
but
gallardo
the
torero
of
the
future
as
startling
as
the
roses
this
lad
will
take
off
the
chignons
of
all
the
cordovan
caliphs
in
this
speech
sevillian
pride
was
latent
the
perpetual
rivalry
with
the
people
of
cordova
also
a
country
of
fine
from
that
day
forward
gallardo
life
was
completely
changed
the
gentlemen
saluted
him
and
made
him
sit
among
them
in
front
of
the
cafés
the
girls
who
formerly
kept
him
from
hunger
and
looked
after
his
adornment
found
themselves
little
by
little
repelled
with
smiling
contempt
even
the
old
protector
withdrew
in
view
of
certain
rebuffs
and
transferred
his
tender
friendship
to
other
youths
who
were
beginning
the
management
of
the
plaza
de
toros
sought
out
gallardo
flattering
him
as
though
he
were
already
a
celebrity
when
his
name
was
announced
on
the
placards
the
result
was
certain
a
bumper
house
the
rabble
applauded
señora
angustias
son
with
transports
telling
tales
of
his
courage
gallardo
renown
soon
spread
throughout
andalusia
and
the
saddler
without
anyone
having
asked
for
his
assistance
now
mixed
himself
up
in
everything
arrogating
to
himself
the
rôle
of
protector
of
his
interests
he
was
a
man
very
expert
according
to
himself
in
business
and
he
saw
his
line
of
life
marked
out
for
ever
your
brother
he
said
at
nights
to
his
wife
as
they
were
going
to
bed
wants
a
practical
man
at
his
side
who
will
look
after
his
interest
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
him
to
name
me
his
manager
it
would
be
a
great
thing
for
him
he
is
better
than
roger
de
flor
and
for
us
the
saddler
imagination
pictured
to
himself
the
great
wealth
that
gallardo
would
acquire
and
he
thought
also
of
the
five
children
he
already
had
and
of
the
rest
which
would
surely
follow
for
he
was
a
man
of
unwearied
and
prolific
conjugal
fidelity
who
knew
if
what
the
espada
earned
might
not
eventually
be
for
one
of
his
nephews
for
a
year
and
a
half
juan
killed
novillos
in
the
best
plazas
in
spain
his
fame
had
even
reached
madrid
the
amateurs
of
that
town
were
curious
to
know
the
sevillian
lad
of
whom
the
newspapers
spoke
so
much
and
of
whom
the
intelligent
andalusians
told
such
stories
gallardo
escorted
by
a
party
of
friends
from
his
own
country
who
were
living
in
madrid
swaggered
on
the
pavement
of
the
calle
de
sevilla
near
the
café
ingles
the
girls
smiled
at
his
gallantries
fixing
their
eyes
on
the
torero
thick
gold
chain
and
his
large
diamonds
jewels
bought
with
his
first
earnings
and
on
the
credit
of
those
of
the
future
a
matador
ought
to
show
by
the
adornment
of
his
person
and
also
by
his
generous
treatment
of
everyone
that
he
has
over
and
above
enough
money
how
distant
those
days
seemed
when
he
and
poor
chiripa
vagabonds
on
that
same
pavement
in
fear
of
the
police
looked
at
the
toreros
with
wondering
eyes
and
picked
up
the
fag
ends
of
their
cigars
his
work
in
madrid
was
fortunate
he
made
friendships
and
soon
gathered
round
him
a
party
of
enthusiasts
anxious
for
novelty
who
also
proclaimed
him
the
torero
of
the
future
protesting
loudly
at
his
not
yet
having

the

celebrated

gave
him

in
a

of

from

he
was
now
no

a
novillero
he
was
a
recognized
matador
and
his
name
figured
on
the
placards
by
the
side
of
all
the
old
espadas
whom
he
had
admired
as
unapproachable
divinities
in
the
days
when
he
went
through
the
little
towns
taking
part
in
the
capeas
he
remembered
having
waited
for
one
of
them
at
a
station
near
cordova
to
beg
a
little
help
from
him
as
he
passed
with
his
cuadrilla
that
night
he
had
something
to
eat
thanks
to
the
fraternal
generosity
existing
between
the
people

made

to
pour
in

the

in
all
the

of
the

they
were
curious
to
see
him
the
professional
papers
popularized
his
portrait
and
his
life
not
without
adding
romantic
episodes
to
this
latter
no
matador
had
as
many
engagements
as
he
had
and
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
made
a
fortune
antonio
his
viewed
this
success
with
scowling
brow
and
grumbling
protests
to
his
wife
and
his
the
fellow
was
ungrateful
it
was
the
way
of
all
those
who
rose
too
rapidly
just
think
how
he
had
worked
for
juan
how
obstinately
he
had
discussed
matters
with
managers
when
they
were
arranging
the
runs
of
novillos
and
now
that
he
was
maestro
he
had
taken
for
agent
a
certain
don
josé
whom
he
scarcely
knew
who
did
not
belong
in
any
way
to
the
family
and
for
whom
gallardo
had
taken
a
great
affection
simply
because
he
was
an
old
amateur
he
will
suffer
for
it
he
ended
by
saying
one
can
only
have
one
family
where
will
he
meet
with
affection
like
ours
who
have
known
him
since
his
earliest
childhood
so
much
the
worse
for
him
with
me
he
would
have
been
like
the
real
roger
but
here
he
stopped
short
swallowing
the
rest
of
the
famous
name
from
fear
of
the
laughter
of
the
banderilleros
and
amateurs
who
frequented
the
matador
house
and
who
had
not
been
slow
in
noticing
this
historical
adoration
of
the
saddler
gallardo
with
the
good
nature
of
a
successful
man
had
endeavoured
to
give
his
some
compensation
entrusting
him
with
the
supervision
of
the
house
he
was
building
he
gave
him
for
all
expenses
for
the
espada
bewildered
with
the
ease
with
which
money
was
pouring
into
his
hands
was
not
sorry
his
should
make
a
profit
and
he
was
pleased
to
make
it
up
to
him
in
this
way
for
not
having
retained
him
as
agent
the
torero
was
now
able
to
carry
out
his
cherished
wish
of
building
a
house
for
his
mother
the
poor
woman
who
had
spent
her
life
in
scrubbing
rich
people
floors
was
now
to
have
her
own
beautiful
patio
with
arches
of
moorish
tiles
and
marble
floors
her
rooms
with
furniture
like
that
of
the
gentry
and
servants
a
great
many
servants
to
wait
on
her
gallardo
also
felt
himself
drawn
by
traditional
affection
to
the
suburbs
where
he
had
spent
his
miserable
childhood
it
pleased
him
to
dazzle
the
people
who
had
employed
his
mother
as
charwoman
or
to
give
a
handful
of
pesetas
in
times
of
distress
to
those
who
had
taken
their
shoes
to
his
father
to
mend
or
had
even
given
himself
a
crust
of
bread
when
he
was
starving
he
bought
several
old
houses
amongst
them
the
very
one
with
the
doorway
under
which
his
father
had
worked
pulled
them
down
and
commenced
a
fine
building
which
should
have
white
walls
the
iron
work
of
its
windows
and
balconies
painted
green
a
vestibule
with
a
dado
of
moorish
tiles
and
an
iron
wicket
of
fine
workmanship
through
which
would
be
seen
the
patio
with
its
fountain
and
arcades
with
marble
pillars
between
which
would
hang
gilded
cages
full
of
singing
birds
the
pleasure
his
felt
on
finding
himself
completely
at
liberty
with
regard
to
the
direction
and
progress
of
the
works
was
damped
by
a
terrible
piece
of
news
gallardo
had
a
sweetheart
it
was
then
full
summer
and
the
matador
was
travelling
from
end
to
end
of
spain
from
one
plaza
to
another
giving
estocades
and
receiving
tumultuous
applause
but
almost
every
day
he
wrote
to
a
young
girl
in
the
suburb
and
during
the
brief
respite
between
two
corridas
he
would
leave
his
companions
taking
the
train
to
spend
a
night
in
seville
pelando
la
pava
with
her
just
fancy
that
cried
the
saddler
aghast
in
what
he
called
the
bosom
of
the
hearth
that
is
to
his
wife
and
a
sweetheart
without
ever
saying
a
word
to
his
family
which
is
the
only
real
thing
that
exists
in
this
world
the
señor
wishes
to
marry
no
doubt
he
is
tired
of
us
what
a
shame
encarnacion
assented
to
her
husband
grumbles
by
energetic
nods
of
her
fierce
looking
but
handsome
head
pleased
on
the
whole
to
express
what
she
thought
about
that
brother
whose
good
fortune
had
always
been
a
source
of
envy
yes
no
doubt
he
had
always
been
utterly
shameless
but
his
mother
raised
her
voice
as
for
that
no
i
know
the
girl
and
her
poor
mother
was
a
friend
of
mine
at
the
fabrica
she
is
as
pure
as
a
river
of
gold
well
mannered
good
handsome
i
have
already
told
juan
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
sooner
the
better
she
was
an
orphan
living
with
some
uncles
who
kept
a
small
provision
shop
in
the
suburb
her
father
a
former
wine
merchant
had
left
her
two
houses
in
the
suburb
of
la
macarena
it
is
not
much
said
señora
angustias
still
the
girl
will
not
come
empty
handed
she
brings
something
of
her
own
and
for
clothes
jesus
those
little
hands
are
worth
their
weight
in
gold
see
how
she
embroiders
how
she
is
preparing
her
dowry
gallardo
remembered
vaguely
having
played
with
her
as
a
child
close
to
the
doorway
where
the
cobbler
worked
while
their
mothers
gossiped
she
was
then
like
a
little
dry
dark
lizard
with
gipsy
eyes
the
whole
pupil
as
black
as
a
drop
of
ink
the
whites
blueish
and
the
corners
pale
pink
when
she
ran
nimbly
as
a
boy
she
showed
legs
like
thin
reeds
and
her
hair
flew
wildly
about
her
head
in
rebellious
and
tangled
curls
like
black
snakes
afterwards
he
had
lost
sight
of
her
not
meeting
her
again
till
many
years
after
when
he
was
a
novillero
and
was
already
beginning
to
make
a
name
it
was
on
a
day
of
corpus
one
of
the
few
festivals
in
which
the
women
generally
kept
at
home
by
their
almost
oriental
laziness
all
come
forth
like
moorish
women
set
at
liberty
in
their
lace
mantillas
pinned
to
their
breasts
with
bunches
of
carnations
gallardo
saw
a
young
girl
tall
slim
but
at
the
same
time
strongly
built
her
waist
well
poised
above
her
curved
and
ample
hips
showing
the
vigour
of
youth
her
face
of
a
paleness
flushed
as
she
saw
the
torero
and
her
eyes
fell
hidden
beneath
their
long
lashes
that
gachi
knows
me
thought
gallardo
vainly
most
probably
she
has
seen
me
in
the
plaza
but
after
following
the
young
girl
and
her
aunt
he
learnt
that
it
was
carmen
the
playmate
of
his
childhood
and
he
felt
confused
and
delighted
at
the
marvellous
transformation
of
the
little
black
lizard
of
former
days
in
a
short
time
they
became
betrothed
and
all
the
neighbours
spoke
of
the
courtship
which
they
considered
so
flattering
to
the
suburb
i
am
like
that
said
gallardo
assuming
the
air
of
a
good
prince
i
do
not
care
to
imitate
those
toreros
who
when
they
marry
ladies
marry
nothing
but
hats
and
feathers
and
flounces
i
prefer
what
belongs
to
my
own
class
a
rich
shawl
a
good
figure
grace
olé
ya
his
friends
delighted
hastened
to
praise
the
girl
a
queenly
presence
curves
that
would
drive
anyone
mad
and
such
a
figure
but
the
torero
frowned
enough
of
these
jests
if
you
please
eh
and
the
less
you
all
talk
of
carmen
the
better
one
night
as
he
was
talking
with
her
through
the
iron
grating
of
her
window
and
looking
at
her
moorish
face
framed
among
the
pots
of
flowers
the
waiter
from
a
neighbouring
tavern
came
bearing
a
tray
on
which
stood
two
glasses
of
manzanilla
it
was
the
messenger
come
to
cobrar
el
piso
the
traditional
sevillian
custom
which
allows
of
this
offering
to
fiancés
as
they
talk
at
the
grating
the
torero
drank
a
glass
offering
the
other
to
carmen
and
then
said
to
the
boy
thank
these
gentlemen
very
much
from
me
and
say
i
will
look
in
presently
tell
montañes
also
that
he
is
not
to
take
any
payment
from
them
for
juan
gallardo
will
pay
for
everything
and
as
soon
as
his
interview
with
his
was
ended
he
walked
across
to
the
tavern
where
those
who
had
offered
the
civility
were
waiting
for
him
some
of
them
friends
others
strangers
but
all
anxious
to
drink
a
glass
at
the
espada
expense
on
his
return
from
his
first
tour
as
recognized
matador
he
spent
his
nights
standing
by
the
iron
grating
of
carmen
window
wrapped
in
his
elegant
and
luxurious
cape
of
a
greenish
cloth
embroidered
with
sprays
and
arabesques
in
black
silk
they
tell
me
you
drink
a
great
deal
sighed
carmen
pressing
her
face
against
the
iron
grating
what
nonsense
only
the
civilities
of
my
friends
that
i
am
obliged
to
return
nothing
more
and
besides
you
see
a
torero
is
a
torero
and
he
can
not
live
like
a
brother
of
mercy
they
tell
me
also
that
you
go
with
loose
women
lies
that
might
have
been
in
former
days
before
i
knew
you
rascals
curse
them
i
should
like
to
know
who
the
slanderers
are
who
whisper
such
things
to
you
and
when
shall
we
be
married
she
continued
cutting
short
her
indignation
by
this
query
as
soon
as
the
house
is
finished
and
would
to
god
that
were
that
blockhead
my
never
gets
done
with
it
the
rascal
finds
it
profitable
and
rests
on
his
oars
i
will
get
everything
into
order
when
we
are
married
juaniyo
you
will
see
everything
will
go
on
all
right
and
you
will
see
how
your
mother
loves
me
and
so
the
dialogues
went
on
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
marriage
of
which
all
seville
was
talking
carmen
uncle
talked
over
the
affair
with
señora
angustias
whenever
they
met
but
all
the
same
the
torero
scarcely
ever
set
foot
in
carmen
house
it
seemed
as
though
some
terrible
prohibition
forbade
him
the
door
anyhow
the
two
preferred
to
see
each
other
at
the
grating
according
to
custom
the
winter
was
passing
by
gallardo
rode
and
hunted
over
the
country
estates
of
several
wealthy
gentlemen
who
used
the
familiar
thou
with
a
patronizing
air
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
preserve
his
bodily
agility
by
continual
exercise
till
the
time
of
the
corridas
came
round
again
he
was
afraid
of
losing
his
great
advantages
of
strength
and
lightness
the
most
indefatigable
advertiser
of
his
fame
was
don
josé
the
gentleman
who
acted
as
his
agent
and
who
called
him
his
own
matador
he
had
a
hand
in
every
act
of
gallardo
not
even
yielding
any
prior
claims
to
the
family
he
lived
on
his
own
income
and
had
no
other
employment
than
that
of
talking
perpetually
of
bulls
and
toreros
for
him
there
was
nothing
interesting
in
the
world
beyond
corridas
and
he
divided
the
nations
into
two
classes
the
elect
who
had
and
the
numberless
others
who
had
neither
sun
gaiety
nor
good
manzanilla
and
yet
thought
themselves
powerful
and
happy
although
they
had
never
seen
even
the
worst
run
of
novillos
he
carried
to
his
love
of
the
sport
the
energy
of
a
champion
of
the
faith
or
of
an
inquisitor
although
he
was
young
he
was
stout
and
slightly
bald
with
a
light
beard
but
this
sociable
man
so
jovial
and
in
ordinary
life
was
fierce
and
unbending
on
the
benches
of
a
plaza
if
his
neighbours
expressed
opinions
differing
from
his
own
he
felt
himself
capable
of
fighting
the
whole
audience
for
a
torero
he
liked
and
he
disturbed
the
plaudits
of
the
public
by
unexpected
objections
when
those
plaudits
were
given
to
any
torero
who
had
not
been
lucky
enough
to
gain
his
affection
he
had
been
a
cavalry
officer
more
on
account
of
his
love
of
horses
than
of
his
love
of
war
his
stoutness
and
his
enthusiasm
for
bulls
had
made
him
retire
from
the
service
oh
to
be
the
guide
the
mentor
the
agent
of
an
espada
when
he
became
possessed
of
this
vehement
desire
all
the
maestros
were
already
provided
so
the
advent
of
gallardo
was
a
to
him
the
slightest
doubt
cast
on
his
hero
merits
made
him
crimson
with
rage
and
he
generally
ended
by
turning
a
discussion
into
a
personal
quarrel
he
considered
it
a
glorious
heroic
act
to
have
come
to
blows
with
two
evil
minded
amateurs
who
censured
his
own
matador
for
being
too
bold
the
press
seemed
to
him
quite
insufficient
to
proclaim
gallardo
fame
so
on
winter
mornings
he
would
go
and
sit
at
a
sunny
corner
at
the
entrance
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
through
which
most
of
his
friends
passed
no
there
is
only
one
man
he
would
say
in
a
loud
voice
as
if
talking
to
himself
pretending
not
to
see
the
people
who
were
approaching
the
first
man
in
the
world
if

were
going
to
marry

ignored
their
chaff
and
began
again

gallardo
wedding
was
a
great
event
at
the
same
time
the
new
house
was
inaugurated
of
which
the
saddler
was
so
proud
that
he
showed
the
patio
the
columns
and
the
moorish
tiles
as
if
they
were
all
the
work
of
his
own
hands
they
were
married
in
san
gil
before
the
virgin
of
hope
also
called
la
macarena
as
they
came
out
of
the
church
the
sun
shone
on
the
tropical
flowers
and
painted
birds
on
hundreds
of
shawls

by
the

the

of
his

and
other
gentlemen
enthusiastic
supporters
of
gallardo
who
smiled
well
pleased
with
the
increase
of
popularity
they
gained
by
being
seen
at
the
torero
side
at
the
house
door
during
the
day
there
was
a
distribution
of
alms
many
poor
people
had
come
even
from
distant
villages
attracted
by
the
reports
of
this
splendid
wedding
there
was
a
grand
repast
in
the
patio
and
several
photographers
took
snapshots
for

papers
for
gallardo
wedding
was
a
national
event
well
on
in
the
night
the
melancholy
tinkling
of
the
guitars
was
still
going
on
accompanied
by
the
rhythmic
clapping
of
hands
and
the
rattle
of
castanets
the
girls
their
arms
raised
danced
with
dainty
feet
on
the
marble
pavement
and
skirts
and
shawls
waved
round
the
pretty
figures
in
the
rhythm
of
sevillanas

of
rich
andalusian
wine
were
opened
by
the
dozen
glasses
of
hot
jerez
of
heady
montilla
and
manzanilla
of
san
lucar
pale
and
perfumed
passed
from
hand
to
hand
they
were
all
tipsy
but
their
drunkenness
was
gentle
quiet
and
melancholy
and
only
betrayed
itself
in
their
sighs
and
songs
often
several
would
start
at
once
singing
melancholy
airs
which
spoke
of
prisons
murders
and
the
poor
mother
that
eternal
theme
of
andalusian
popular
songs
at
midnight
the
last
of
the
guests
departed
and
the
couple
were
left
alone
in
their
house
with
señora
angustias
the
saddler
on
leaving
made
a
gesture
of
despair
tipsy
he
was
besides
furious
for
no
one
had
taken
any
notice
of
him
during
the
day
just
as
if
he
were
a
nobody
as
if
he
did
not
belong
to
the
family
they
are
turning
us
out
encarnacion
that
girl
with
her
face
like
the
of
hope
will
be
mistress
of
everything
and
there
will
not
even
be
for
us
you
will
see
the
house
full
of
children
and
the
prolific
husband
became
furious
at
the
idea
of
the
posterity
that
would
come
to
the
espada
a
posterity
sent
into
the
world
with
the
sole
object
of
damaging
his
own
children
time
went
by
and
a
year
passed
without
señor
antonio
prognostications
being
verified
gallardo
and
carmen
went
to
all
the
fêtes
with
the
ostentation
and
show
suitable
to
a
rich
and
popular
couple
carmen
with
manila
shawls
which
drew
cries
of
admiration
from
poorer
women
gallardo
displaying
all
his
diamonds
ever
ready
to
take
out
his
purse
to
treat
friends
or
to
help
the
beggars
who
came
in
swarms
the
gitanas
loquacious
and
copper
coloured
as
witches
besieged
carmen
with
their
good
auguries
might
god
bless
her
she
would
soon
have
a
child
a
churumbel
more
beautiful
than
the
sun
they
knew
it
by
the
whites
of
her
eyes
it
was
already
half
way
on
but
in
vain
carmen
dropped
her
eyes
and
blushed
with
modesty
and
pleasure
in
vain
the
espada
drew
himself
up
proud
of
his
work
and
hoped
the
prediction
would
come
true
but
still
the
child
did
not
come
so
another
year
passed
and
still
the
hopes
of
the
couple
were
not
realized
señora
angustias
became
sad
as
she
spoke
of
their
disappointment
she
certainly
had
other
grandchildren
the
children
of
encarnacion
whom
the
saddler
was
careful
should
spend
most
of
their
time
in
their
grandmother
house
doing
their
best
to
please
their
señor
tio
but
she
who
wished
to
compensate
for
her
former
unkindness
by
the
warm
affection
she
now
showed
juan
wished
to
have
a
son
of
his
to
bring
up
in
her
own
way
giving
it
all
the
love
she
had
been
unable
to
give
its
father
during
his
miserable
childhood
i
know
what
it
is
said
the
old
woman
sadly
poor
carmen
has
too
many
anxieties
you
should
see
the
poor
thing
when
juan
is
wandering
about
the
world
during
the
winter
the
season
of
rest
when
the
torero
was
for
the
most
part
at
home
or
only
went
into
the
country
for
the
trials
of
young
bulls
or
for
hunting
parties
all
went
well
carmen
was
happy
knowing
her
husband
ran
no
risks
she
laughed
at
anything
ate
and
her
face
was
bright
with
the
hues
of
health
but
as
soon
as
the
spring
time
came
round
and
juan
left
home
to
fight
in
the
different
plazas
in
spain
the
poor
girl
became
pale
and
weak
and
fell
into
a
painful
languor
her
eyes
dilated
by
terror
ready
to
shed
tears
on
the
slightest
occasion
he
has
corridas
this
year
said
the
intimates
of
the
house
speaking
of
the
espada
engagements
no
one
is
so
sought
after
as
he
is
carmen
smiled
with
a
sorrowful
face
afternoons
of
anguish
in
the
chapel
like
a
criminal
condemned
to
death
longing
for
the
arrival
of
the
telegram
in
the
evening
and
yet
dreading
to
open
it
days
of
terror
of
vague
superstitions
thinking
that
one
word
forgotten
in
a
prayer
might
influence
the
fate
of
the
absent
one
days
of
pained
surprise
at
living
in
a
great
house
seeing
the
same
people
and
finding
life
go
on
in
its
usual
way
as
though
nothing
extraordinary
was
going
on
in
the
world
hearing
her
nephews
playing
in
the
patio
and
the
flower
sellers
crying
their
wares
outside
while
down
there
far
away
in
unknown
towns
her
beloved
juan
was
fighting
those
fierce
beasts
before
thousands
of
eyes
and
seeing
death
lightly
pass
by
his
breast
with
every
wave
of
the
red
rag
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
ay
those
days
of
a
corrida
those
holidays
when
the
sky
seemed
bluer
and
the
usually
solitary
street
echoed
beneath
the
holiday
footsteps
when
guitars
tinkled
accompanied
by
hand
clappings
and
songs
in
the
tavern
at
the
corner
then
carmen
plainly
dressed
with
her
mantilla
over
her
eyes
flying
from
those
evil
dreams
would
leave
her
house
to
take
refuge
in
a
church
her
simple
faith
which
anxiety
peopled
with
vague
superstitions
made
her
go
from
altar
to
altar
weighing
in
her
mind
the
merits
and
miracles
of
each
image
some
days
she
would
go
to
san
gil
the
popular
church
which
had
witnessed
the
happiest
day
of
her
life
to
kneel
before
the
virgin
de
la
macarena
by
the
light
of
the
numerous
tapers
she
ordered
to
be
lighted
she
would
gaze
at
the
dark
face
of
that
statue
with
its
black
eyes
and
long
lashes
which
many
said
so
singularly
resembled
her
own
in
her
she
trusted
she
was
not
the
lady
of
hope
for
nothing
surely
at
that
time
she
was
protecting
juan
with
her
divine
power
but
suddenly
uncertainty
and
fear
crept
through
her
beliefs
rending
them
the
virgin
was
only
a
woman
and
women
can
do
so
little
their
fate
is
to
suffer
and
to
weep
as
she
was
weeping
for
her
husband
as
that
other
had
wept
for
her
son
she
must
confide
in
stronger
powers
so
with
the
egoism
of
pain
she
abandoned
la
macarena
without
scruple
like
a
useless
friend
and
went
to
the
church
of
san
lorenzo
in
search
of
our
father
jesus
of
great
power
the
with
his
crown
of
thorns
and
his
cross
by
his
side
perspiring
and
tearful
an
image
that
the
sculptor
montañes
had
known
how
to
make
terrifying
the
dramatic
sadness
of
the
nazarene
stumbling
over
the
stones
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
his
cross
seemed
to
console
the
poor
wife
the
lord
of
great
power
this
vague
but
grandiose
title
tranquilised
her
if
that
god
dressed
in
purple
velvet
with
gold
embroideries
would
only
listen
to
her
sighs
and
prayers
repeated
hurriedly
with
dizzy
rapidity
so
that
the
greatest
possible
number
of
words
should
be
said
in
the
shortest
possible
time
she
was
sure
that
juan
would
come
safe
and
sound
out
of
the
arena
where
he
was
at
that
moment
fighting
at
other
times
she
would
give
money
to
a
sacristan
to
light
some
wax
tapers
and
would
spend
hours
watching
the
rosy
reflection
of
the
red
tongues
on
the
image
fancying
she
saw
on
its
varnished
face
in
the
changing
light
and
shadow
smiles
of
consolation
which
augured
happiness
the
lord
of
great
power
did
not
deceive
her
when
she
returned
to
her
house
the
little
blue
paper
arrived
which
she
opened
with
trembling
hands
nothing
new
she
could
breathe
again
and
sleep
like
the
criminal
who
is
freed
for
the
moment
from
the
fear
of
instant
death
but
in
two
or
three
days
the
torment
of
uncertainty
the
terrible
fear
of
the
unknown
would
begin
afresh
in
spite
of
the
love
carmen
professed
for
her
husband
there
were
times
when
her
heart
rose
in
rebellion
if
she
had
only
known
what
this
life
was
before
her
marriage
now
and
then
impelled
by
the
community
of
suffering
she
would
go
and
see
the
wives
of
the
men
who
composed
cuadrilla
as
if
those
women
could
give
her
news
the
wife
of
el
nacional
who
had
a
tavern
in
the
same
quarter
received
the
chief
wife
tranquilly
and
seemed
surprised
at
her
fears
she
was
used
to
the
life
and
her
husband
must
be
quite
well
as
he
sent
no
news
telegrams
were
dear
and
a
banderillero
earned
little
enough
when
the
newspaper
sellers
did
not
shout
an
accident
it
meant
that
nothing
untoward
had
happened
and
she
went
on
attending
to
the
affairs
of
her
tavern
as
if
anxiety
could
not
penetrate
the
hard
rind
of
her
susceptibilities
other
times
she
would
cross
the
bridge
and
penetrate
into
the
suburb
of
triana
in
search
of
the
wife
of
potaje
the
picador
a
kind
of
gitana
who
lived
in
a
hovel
like
a
fowl
house
surrounded
by
dirty
copper
coloured
brats
whom
she
ordered
about
and
terrified
by
her
stentorian
shouts
the
visit
of
the
chief
wife
filled
her
with
pride
but
her
anxieties
made
her
laugh
she
ought
not
to
be
afraid
the
men
on
foot
nearly
always
got
clear
of
the
bull
and
the
señor
juan
was
very
lucky
in
throwing
himself
on
the
beast
bulls
killed
few
people
the
terrible
things
were
the
falls
from
it
was
well
known
what
was
the
end
of
nearly
all
picadors
after
a
life
of
horrible
tosses
he
who
did
not
end
his
life
in
an
unforeseen
and
sudden
accident
generally
died
mad
no
doubt
poor
potaje
would
die
in
this
way
he
would
have
endured
all
these
hardships
for
a
handful
of
duros
whereas
others
she
did
not
conclude
her
sentence
but
her
eyes
expressed
a
mute
protest
against
the
injustice
of
fate
against
those
fine
fellows
who
directly
they
handled
a
sword
appropriated
all
the
plaudits
the
popularity
and
the
money
running
no
more
risk
than
their
humble
colleagues
little
by
little
carmen
became
accustomed
to
the
existence
the
cruel
waits
on
the
days
of
a
corrida
the
visits
to
the
saints
the
superstitions
doubts
were
all
accepted
as
forming
part
and
parcel
of
her
life
besides
her
husband
usual
good
luck
and
the
constant
conversation
in
the
house
on
the
chances
of
the
fight
ended
by
familiarizing
her
with
the
danger
and
at
last
the
bull
came
to
be
for
her
a
fairly
and
noble
animal
who
had
come
into
the
world
for
the
express
purpose
of
enriching
and
giving
fame
to
their
matadors
she
had
never
been
to
a
corrida
of
bulls
since
the
afternoon
when
she
had
seen
her
future
husband
at
his
first
novillada
she
had
never
been
near
the
plaza
she
felt
she
should
not
have
the
courage
to
see
a
corrida
even
though
gallardo
were
taking
no
part
in
it
she
should
faint
with
terror
seeing
other
men
face
the
danger
dressed
in
the
same
costume
as
juan
after
they
had
been
married
three
years
the
espada
was
wounded
in
valencia
carmen
did
not
hear
of
it
at
once
the
telegram
came
at
the
usual
hour
bearing
the
habitual
nothing
new
and
it
was
through
the
kindness
of
don
josé
who
visited
carmen
daily
and
performed
clever
sleight
of
hand
tricks
to
prevent
her
seeing
the
papers
that
the
news
was
kept
from
her
for
over
a
week
when
through
the
indiscretion
of
some
neighbours
carmen
at
last
heard
of
the
accident
she
wished
at
once
to
take
the
train
to
join
her
husband
and
nurse
him
feeling
sure
he
was
neglected
but
there
was
no
need
the
espada
arrived
before
she
could
leave
pale
from
loss
of
blood
and
obliged
to
keep
one
leg
quiet
for
some
time
but
gay
and
jaunty
in
order
to
reassure
his
family
the
house
became
at
once
a
kind
of
sanctuary
all
sorts
of
people
passed
through
the
patio
in
order
to
salute
gallardo
the
first
man
in
the
world
who
sitting
in
a
cane
with
his
leg
on
a
footstool
smoked
quietly
as
though
his
flesh
had
not
been
torn
by
a
horrible
wound
doctor
ruiz
who
had
brought
him
back
to
seville
declaring
he
would
be
cured
in
a
month
was
astonished
at
the
vigour
of
his
constitution
the
facility
with
which
toreros
were
cured
was
a
mystery
for
him
in
spite
of
his
long
practice
as
a
surgeon
the
horn
filthy
with
blood
and
excrement
very
often
broken
at
the
ends
by
blows
into
small
splinters
broke
the
flesh
lacerated
it
perforated
it
so
that
it
was
at
the
same
time
a
deep
penetrating
wound
and
a
crushing
bruise
but
all
the
same
these
awful
wounds
were
cured
far
more
easily
than
those
of
daily
life
how
it
can
be
i
know
not
it
is
a
mystery
said
the
old
surgeon
much
perplexed
either
these
lads
have
flesh
like
a
dog
or
the
horn
in
spite
of
its
filth
has
some
curative
property
unknown
to
us
shortly
afterwards
gallardo
recommenced
fighting
his
wound
in
spite
of
his
enemies
predictions
having
in
no
way
abated
his
fighting
ardour
after
they
had
been
married
about
four
years
the
espada
gave
his
wife
and
mother
a
great
surprise
they
were
going
to
become
landed
proprietors
proprietors
on
a
large
scale
with
lands
of
which
they
could
not
see
the
end
olive
yards
mills
herds
innumerable
an
estate
as
fine
as
that
of
the
richest
men
in
seville
gallardo
was
like
all
toreros
who
only
dream
of
being
owners
of
the
soil
and
to
be
horse
and
cattle
breeders
town
property
stocks
and
shares
in
no
way
tempt
them
and
they
understand
nothing
whatever
about
them
but
bulls
make
them
think
of
the
broad
plains
and
horses
remind
them
of
the
country
besides
the
necessity
of
constant
movement
and
exercise
by
hunting
and
walking
during
the
winter
months
adds
to
their
desire
to
possess
the
soil
according
to
gallardo
ideas
no
one
could
be
rich
unless
he
owned
a
large
farm
and
immense
herds
of
cattle
ever
since
the
years
of
his
poverty
when
he
had
wandered
on
foot
through
the
cultivated
lands
and
pastures
he
had
always
nourished
the
fervent

chapter
iii
during
the
winter
months
when
gallardo
was
not
at
la
rinconada
a
party
of
his
friends
gathered
every
evening
in
his
after
supper
the
first
to
arrive
were
always
the
saddler
and
his
wife
two
of
whose
children
lived
in
the
espada
house
carmen
as
though
she
wished
to
forget
her
own
sterility
and
felt
the
silence
of
the
big
house
oppress
her
kept
her
two
youngest
children
with
her
these
children
from
natural
affection
and
also
probably
by
their
express
orders
were
perpetually
petting
their
beautiful
aunt
and
their
generous
and
popular
uncle
kissing
them
and
purring
on
their
knees
like
kittens
encarnacion
now
almost
as
stout
and
heavy
as
her
mother
her
figure
deformed
by
the
birth
of
her
numerous
children
while
advancing
years
were
bringing
a
slight
moustache
to
her
upper
lip
smiled
cringingly
at
her
apologizing
for
the
trouble
her
children
gave
but
before
carmen
could
reply
the
saddler
broke
in
leave
them
alone
wife
they
are
so
fond
of
their
uncle
and
aunt
the
little
girl
especially
she
can
not
live
without
her
carmen
so
the
two
children
lived
there
as
if
it
were
their
own
house
guessing
with
their
infantile
cunning
what
was
expected
of
them
by
their
parents
exaggerating
their
caresses
and
pettings
of
those
rich
relations
of
whom
they
heard
everyone
speak
with
respect
as
soon
as
supper
was
ended
they
kissed
the
hands
of
señora
angustias
and
of
their
father
and
mother
threw
their
arms
round
the
necks
of
gallardo
and
his
wife
and
then
left
the
room
to
go
to
bed
the
grandmother
occupied
an
armchair
at
the
head
of
the
table
but
when
the
espada
had
guests
and
they
were
all
people
of
a
certain
social
position
she
refused
to
take
the
place
of
honour
but
gallardo
insisted
no
protested
gallardo
the
little
mother
must
preside
sit
you
down
there
mother
or
we
wo
have
any
supper
offering
her
his
arm
he
would
conduct
her
to
her
chair
lavishing
on
her
the
most
affectionate
caresses
as
if
he
wished
to
make
up
for
the
torments
his
vagabond
youth
had
caused
her
when
el
nacional
looked
in
during
the
evening
for
an
hour
rather
with
the
feeling
of
fulfilling
a
duty
towards
his
chief
the
party
became
more
lively
gallardo
wearing
a
rich
zamorra
like
a
wealthy
landowner
his
head
bare
and
the
smoothed
forward
almost
to
his
forehead
welcomed
his
banderillero
with
loquacious
amiability
what
were
the
amateurs
of
the
sport
saying
what
lies
were
they
spreading
how
were
the
affairs
of
the
republic
getting
on
garabato
give
sebastian
a
glass
of
wine
but
el
nacional
refused
the
preferred
civility
no
wine
thanks
he
never
drank
wine
was
the
cause
of
all
the
working
classes
being
so
hopelessly
behindhand
all
the
assembly
burst
out
laughing
as
if
something
amusing
had
been
said
which
they
were
expecting
and
the
banderillero
began
at
once
to
air
his
opinions
the
only
one
who
remained
silent
with
hostile
eyes
was
the
saddler
he
hated
el
nacional
seeing
in
him
an
enemy
he
also
like
a
good
and
faithful
husband
was
prolific
and
a
swarm
of
brats
tumbled
about
the
tavern
hanging
on
to
their
mother
skirts
the
two
youngest
were
godchildren
of
gallardo
and
his
wife
so
that
in
this
way
there
was
a
sort
of
connection
between
the
two
hypocrite
every
sunday
he
brought
the
two
children
dressed
in
their
best
to
kiss
the
hands
of
their
godparents
and
the
saddler
grew
pale
with
anger
whenever
el
children
received
any
present
he
came
to
rob
their
own
children
possibly
the
banderillero
even
dreamed
that
part
of
gallardo
fortune
might
come
to
those
godchildren
thief
a
man
who
did
not
even
belong
to
the
family
when
the
saddler
did
not
receive
el
nacional
discourses
in
sulky
silence
or
with
looks
of
hatred
he
endeavoured
to
mortify
him
by
saying
that
in
his
opinion
every
one
who
propagated
revolutionary
ideas
among
the
people
was
a
danger
to
honest
people
and
ought
to
be
shot
at
once
el
nacional
was
ten
years
older
than
his
chief
when
the
latter
was
beginning
to
bait
at
the
capeas
sebastian
was
already
banderillero
in
recognized
cuadrillas
and
had
lately
returned
from
america
where
he
had
killed
bulls
in
the
plaza
at
lima
at
the
commencement
of
his
career
he
had
enjoyed
a
certain
amount
of
popularity
because
he
was
young
and
agile
he
also
for
some
little
time
had
figured
as
the
torero
of
the
future
and
the
amateurs
of
seville
fixing
their
eyes
on
him
hoped
that
he
would
have
eclipsed
the
matadors
from
other
towns
but
this
lasted
only
a
short
time
on
his
return
from
his
american
journey
with
the
prestige
of
distant
and
possibly
nebulous
feats
all
the
populace
of
seville
rushed
to
the
plaza
to
see
him
kill
thousands
of
people
could
not
obtain
admittance
but
at
this
moment
of
decisive
proof
his
heart
failed
him
as
the
amateurs
said
he
planted
the
banderillas
steadily
as
a
serious
and
conscientious
worker
fulfilling
his
duty
but
when
it
was
a
case
of
killing
the
instinct
of
stronger
than
his
will
kept
him
at
a
distance
from
the
bull
and
he
was
unable
to
take
advantage
of
his
great
stature
and
his
strong
arm
el
nacional
therefore
renounced
the
higher
glories
of
tauromachia
he
would
be
a
banderillero
and
nothing
more
he
must
resign
himself
to
being
as
it
were
a
day
labourer
of
his
art
serving
others
younger
than
himself
in
order
to
earn
the
poor
wages
of
peon
with
which
to
maintain
his
family
and
save
sufficient
to
start
some
small
business
his
kindness
and
his
honourable
habits
were
proverbial
among
his
colleagues
of
the
consequently
his
chief
wife
was
much
attached
to
him
seeing
in
him
a
kind
of
guardian
angel
of
her
fidelity
when
in
summer
gallardo
with
all
his
men
went
to
a
café
chantant
in
some
provincial
town
anxious
to
enjoy
himself
and
have
a
fling
el
nacional
would
stand
silent
and
grave
among
the
singers
in
diaphanous
dresses
with
painted
mouths
like
some
ancient
father
of
the
desert
amid
the
alexandrian
courtezans
it
was
not
that
he
felt
shocked
but
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
little
ones
down
in
seville
according
to
him
all
the
defects
and
vices
in
the
world
were
the
result
of
want
of
education
and
most
certainly
those
poor
women
knew
neither
how
to
read
nor
write
it
was
also
the
case
with
himself
and
as
he
attributed
his
own
insignificance
and
poverty
of
brain
to
this
deficiency
he
attributed
to
the
same
cause
all
the
misery
and
degradation
which
exists
in
the
world
in
his
early
youth
he
had
worked
as
a
founder
and
had
been
an
active
member
of
the
international
of
workmen
he
had
been
an
assiduous
listener
to
those
of
his
fellow
workmen
who
happier
than
himself
could
read
aloud
what
was
said
in
the
papers
devoted
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
during
the
time
of
the
national
militia
he
had
played
at
being
a
soldier
figuring
in
those
battalions
who
wore
a
red
cap
in
sign
of
their
federal
intransigeance
he
had
spent
whole
days
in
front
of
those
platforms
erected
in
public
places
or
in
those
clubs
which
had
declared
themselves
in
permanent
sitting
where
the
orators
succeeded
each
other
day
and
night
ranting
with
andalusian
facility
on
the
divinity
of
jesus
or
the
rise
in
price
of
articles
of
the
first
necessity
till
the
time
for
repression
came
when
a
strike
left
him
in
the
trying
position
of
being
a
workman
marked
for
his
revolutionary
opinions
and
excluded
from
every
workshop
then
as
he
was
fond
of
he
became
torero
at
just
as
he
might
have
chosen
any
other
line
of
life
besides
he
knew
a
great
deal
and
spoke
with
contempt
of
the
absurdities
of
existing
society
he
had
not
spent
many
years
listening
to
papers
being
read
in
vain
however
bad
a
torero
he
might
be
he
would
earn
more
and
would
lead
an
easier
life
than
ever
so
skilled
a
workman
his
friends
remembering
the
days
when
he
shouldered
the
musket
of
the
national
militia
nicknamed
him
el
nacional
he
always
spoke
of
the
taurine
profession
with
a
kind
of
remorse
apologising
for
belonging
to
it
in
spite
of
his
many
years
service
the
committee
of
his
district
who
had
decreed
the
expulsion
from
the
party
of
all
their
who
attended
corridas
as
being
barbarous
and
retrograde
had
made
an
exception
in
his
favour
keeping
him
on
the
list
of
voters
i
am
well
aware
he
would
say
in
gallardo
that
are
reactionary
something
akin
to
the
days
of
the
inquisition
i
do
not
know
if
i
am
explaining
myself
clearly
but
to
read
and
write
is
quite
as
necessary
to
the
people
as
to
have
bread
and
it
is
wrong
that
money
should
be
spent
on
us
while
schools
are
so
sadly
wanted
that
is
what
the
papers
that
come
from
madrid
say
but
my
esteem
me
and
the
committee
after
a
lecture
from
don
joselito
kept
me
on
the
register
of
the
party
his
great
gravity
that
not
even
the
jokes
or
the
comic
exaggerations
of
fury
on
the
part
of
the
espada
and
his
friends
could
shake
expressed
an
honourable
pride
in
this
exceptional
favour
with
which
his
had
honoured
him
don
joselito
master
of
a
primary
school
verbose
and
enthusiastic
who
presided
over
the
district
committee
was
a
young
man
of
jewish
origin
who
brought
into
political
strife
all
the
ardour
of
the
maccabees
and
was
proud
of
his
swarthy
ugliness
pitted
with
smallpox
because
he
thought
it
made
him
resemble
danton
el
nacional
always
listened
to
him
when
don
josé
and
the
maestro
other
friends
after
dinner
ironically
attacked
el
national
doctrines
with
all
sorts
of
extravagant
arguments
the
poor
man
would
look
confused
and
scratching
his
head
would
say
you
are
gentlemen
and
you
have
been
educated
i
know
neither
how
to
read
nor
write
and
that
is
why
we
of
the
lower
orders
are
such
simpletons
oh
if
only
don
joselito
were
here
by
the
life
of
the
blue
dove
if
only
you
could
hear
him
when
he
starts
speaking
like
an
angel
and
in
order
to
strengthen
his
faith
perhaps
a
little
shaken
by
these
attacks
of
ridicule
he
would
go
next
day
to
see
his
idol
who
seemed
to
take
a
bitter
pleasure
as
a
descendant
of
the
great
persecuted
nation
in
showing
him
what
he
called
his
museum
of
horrors
this
jew
returned
to
the
natal
country
of
his
ancestors
had
collected
in
a
room
attached
to
the
school
souvenirs
of
the
inquisition
and
with
the
meticulous
vindictiveness
of
a
fugitive
prisoner
endeavoured
to
reconstruct
hour
by
hour
the
skeleton
of
his
jailor
there
on
the
shelves
of
a
cupboard
were
rows
of
books
and
parchments
accounts
of
autos
da
fe
and
lists
of
questions
wherewith
to
interrogate
the
criminals
during
their
torture
on
one
wall
was
hung
a
white
banner
with
the
dreaded
green
cross
and
in
the
corner
were
piles
of
torturing
irons
fearful
scourges
every
instrument
that
don
joselito
could
pick
up
on
the
hucksters
stalls
that
had
been
used
to
split
to
tear
with
pincers
or
to
shred
which
was
catalogued
immediately
as
an
ancient
possession
of
the
holy
office
el
nacional
and
his
simple
soul
quick
to
feel
indignation
rose
up
against
those
rusty
irons
and
those
green
crosses
good
heavens
and
there
are
people
who
say
by
the
life
of
the
dove
i
wish
i
had
some
of
them
here
the
desire
of
proselytism
made
him
air
his
convictions
on
every
occasion
regardless
of
his
companion
jests
but
even
in
this
he
showed
himself
as
he
was
never
personally
bitter
according
to
him
those
who
remained
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
the
country
and
did
not
figure
on
the
party
register
were
poor
victims
of
the
national
ignorance
the
salvation
of
the
people
depended
on
their
learning
to
read
and
write
for
his
own
part
he
was
obliged
modestly
to
renounce
this
regeneration
as
he
felt
himself
too
thick
skulled
but
he
made
the
whole
world
responsible
for
his
ignorance
very
often
in
summer
when
the
cuadrilla
was
travelling
from
one
province
to
another
and
gallardo
changed
into
the
carriage
where
his
lads
were
travelling
the
door
would
open
and
some
country
priest
or
a
couple
of
friars
would
enter
the
banderilleros
would
nudge
each
others
elbows
and
wink
as
they
looked
at
el
nacional
become
even
more
grave
and
solemn
than
usual
in
presence
of
the
enemy
the
picadors
potaje
and
tragabuches
rough
and
aggressive
fellows
fond
of
quarrels
and
practical
jokes
who
besides
had
an
instinctive
dislike
to
the
cassocks
egged
him
on
in
a
low
voice
now
you
have
got
him
go
in
at
him
straight
give
him
one
in
the
eye
in
your
own
but
the
maestro
with
his
authority
as
chief
of
the
cuadrilla
which
no
one
dare
to
contest
or
discuss
rolled
his
eyes
fiercely
as
he
looked
at
el
nacional
who
was
obliged
to
observe
a
silent
obedience
but
the
zeal
of
proselytism
was
stronger
in
this
simple
soul
than
his
subordination
and
one
insignificant
word
was
sufficient
to
start
him
on
a
discussion
with
his
fellow
travellers
trying
to
convince
them
of
the
truth
but
indeed
the
truth
according
to
him
seemed
an
inextricable
and
tangled
skein
of
ranting
that
he
had
gathered
from
don
joselito
his
companions
looked
on
with
astonishment
delighted
that
one
of
their
own
set
could
make
head
against
educated
men
and
even
put
them
in
a
corner
which
by
the
way
might
not
be
very
difficult
as
the
spanish
clergy
as
a
rule
are
not
highly
educated
the
priests
bewildered
by
el
nacional
fiery
arguments
and
the
laughter
of
the
other
toreros
ended
by
appealing
to
their
final
argument
how
could
men
who
exposed
their
lives
so
frequently
not
think
of
god
and
believe
such
things
did
they
not
think
that
at
that
very
time
their
wives
and
their
mothers
were
most
probably
praying
for
them
the
cuadrilla
became
suddenly
silent
a
silence
of
fear
as
they
thought
of
the
holy
medals
and
scapularies
that
their
women
hands
had
sewn
into
their
fighting
clothes
before
they
left
seville
the
espada
wounded
in
his
slumbering
superstitions
was
furious
with
el
nacional
as
if
the
banderillero
impiety
would
place
his
own
life
in
danger
shut
up
and
stop
your
blasphemies
your
pardon
sirs
i
pray
you
he
is
a
good
fellow
but
his
head
has
been
turned
by
all
these
lies
shut
up
and
do
answer
me
curse
you
i
will
fill
your
mouth
with
and
gallardo
to
appease
those
gentlemen
whom
he
considered
as
depositaries
of
the
future
overwhelmed
the
banderillero
with
threats
and
curses
el
nacional
took
refuge
in
a
contemptuous
silence
it
was
all
ignorance
and
superstition
all
from
not
knowing
how
to
read
and
write
and
strong
in
his
faith
with
the
obstinacy
of
a
simple
man
who
only
possesses
two
or
three
ideas
and
clutches
hold
of
them
in
the
face
of
the
roughest
shocks
he
would
shortly
afterwards
renew
the
discussion
regardless
of
the
matador
anger
his
did
not
leave
him
even
in
the
circus
among
those
peons
and
picadors
who
having
said
their
prayer
in
the
chapel
entered
the
arena
in
the
hope
that
the
sacred
scapularies
sewn
into
their
clothes
would
guard
them
from
danger
when
an
enormous
bull
of
many
pounds
as
it
is
called
with
a
powerful
neck
and
a
black
coat
arrived
at
the
turn
of
the
banderilleros
el
nacional
with
his
arms
open
and
the
darts
in
his
hand
would
stand
a
short
distance
from
the
animal
shouting
insultingly
come
along
priest
the
priest
threw
himself
furiously
on
el
nacional
who
fixed
the
darts
firmly
in
his
neck
as
he
rushed
past
shouting
loudly
as
if
he
were
proclaiming
a
victory
one
for
the
clergy
gallardo
ended
by
laughing
at
el
nacional
extravagances
you
are
making
me
ridiculous
people
will
notice
my
cuadrilla
and
say
we
are
nothing
but
a
band
of
heretics
you
know
there
are
some
audiences
whom
this
might
not
please
a
torero
ought
to
be
nothing
but
a
torero
all
the
same
he
was
greatly
attached
to
his
banderillero
remembering
his
devotion
which
more
than
once
had
reached
the
point
of
it
signified
nothing
to
el
nacional
that
he
should
be
hissed
when
he
stuck
the
banderillos
into
a
dangerous
bull
anyhow
so
as
to
end
the
matter
more
quickly
he
did
not
care
for
glory
and
he
only
fought
to
earn
his
livelihood
but
once
gallardo
advanced
rapier
in
hand
towards
a
savage
animal
his
banderillero
remained
close
by
his
side
ready
to
assist
him
with
his
heavy
cloak
and
his
strong
arm
which
obliged
the
brute
to
lower
his
poll
on
two
occasions
when
gallardo
had
been
rolled
over
in
the
arena
and
was
in
danger
of
being
gored
by
the
horns
el
nacional
had
thrown
himself
on
the
beast
forgetful
of
his
children
his
wife
the
tavern
everything
intending
to
die
himself
in
order
to
save
his
master
on
his
entry
into
gallardo
in
the
evenings
he
was
received
like
a
member
of
the
family
the
señora
angustias
felt
that
affection
for
him
so
often
existing
between
people
of
a
lower
class
when
they
find
themselves
in
a
higher
atmosphere
and
which
draws
them
together
come
and
sit
by
me
sebastian
wo
you
really
take
anything
tell
me
how
the
establishment
is
getting
on
teresa
and
the
children
well
i
hope
then
el
nacional
would
enumerate
the
sales
of
the
previous
day
so
many
glasses
of
wine
over
the
counter
so
many
bottles
of
country
wine
delivered
at
houses
and
the
old
woman
listened
with
the
attention
of
one
used
to
poverty
and
who
knows
the
value
of
money
to
the
very
last
farthing
sebastian
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
increasing
his
trade
a
bureau
de
tabac
in
his
tavern
would
suit
him
down
to
the
ground
the
espada
could
get
him
this
through
his
friendship
with
great
people
but
sebastian
felt
scruples
at
asking
such
a
favour
you
see
seña
angustias
the
bureau
is
a
thing
that
depends
on
the
government
and
i
have
my
principles
i
figure
on
the
register
of
my
party
and
am
also
on
the
committee
what
would
my
say
the
old
woman
was
indignant
at
these
scruples
what
he
had
to
do
was
to
bring
as
much
bread
into
the
family
as
he
could
that
poor
teresa
with
such
a
lot
of
children
do
be
foolish
sebastian
get
all
these
cobwebs
out
of
your
brain
now
do
answer
me
do
start
telling
me
all
sorts
of
impieties
like
the
other
night
remember
i
am
going
to
hear
mass
at
la
macarena
morning
but
gallardo
and
don
josé
who
were
smoking
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
a
glass
of
cognac
within
reach
of
their
hands
and
who
delighted
in
making
el
nacional
talk
so
that
they
could
laugh
at
his
ideas
egged
him
on
by
depreciating
don
joselito
an
imposter
who
upset
ignorant
men
like
him
the
banderillero
received
his
master
jokes
meekly
enough
to
doubt
don
joselito
such
a
patent
absurdity
could
not
make
him
angry
it
was
as
though
some
one
was
hitting
at
his
other
idol
gallardo
by
saying
he
did
not
know
how
to
kill
a
bull
but
when
he
heard
the
saddler
who
inspired
him
with
an
unconquerable
aversion
take
part
in
these
jests
he
lost
his
calm
who
was
that
scamp
living
by
hanging
on
to
his
master
that
he
should
dare
to
argue
with
him
with
him
and
then
losing
all
restraint
taking
no
notice
of
the
espada
wife
and
mother
or
of
encarnacion
who
imitating
her
husband
pursed
up
her
mustachioed
lip
looking
contemptuously
at
the
banderillero
the
latter
launched
himself
full
sail
on
the
exposition
of
his
ideas
with
the
same
ardour
as
when
he
discussed
in
committee
for
want
of
better
arguments
he
overwhelmed
the
beliefs
of
others
with
insults
the
bible
rubbish
the
creation
of
the
world
in
six
days
rubbish
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
rubbish
the
whole
of
it
lies
and
superstition
and
this
word
rubbish
that
he
employed
in
order
not
to
use
one
even
more
disrespectful
and
that
he
applied
to
everything
which
seemed
to
him
false
and
ridiculous
took
on
his
lips
an
astonishing
intensity
of
contempt
the
history
of
adam
and
eve
was
for
him
the
subject
of
sarcasm
he
had
reflected
much
on
this
point
during
the
hours
of
quiet
drowsiness
when
he
was
travelling
with
the
cuadrilla
during
which
time
he
had
discovered
an
irrefutable
argument
drawn
entirely
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
how
could
it
be
thought
that
all
human
beings
were
descended
from
one
only
pair
i
call
myself
sebastian
venegas
and
so
it
is
and
you
juaniyo
you
call
yourself
gallardo
and
you
don
josé
have
also
your
own
name
every
one
has
his
own
and
when
the
names
are
the
same
people
must
be
relations
if
then
we
were
all
grandchildren
of
adam
and
adam
name
was
we
will
suppose
perez
we
should
all
be
named
perez
that
is
quite
clear
well
then
if
we
all
have
our
family
names
there
must
have
been
a
great
many
adams
and
so
what
the
priests
tell
us
is
all
rubbish
retrograde
superstition
it
is
education
we
want
and
the
clergy
take
advantage
of
our
ignorance
i
think
i
am
explaining
myself
gallardo
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
screaming
with
laughter
greeted
the
orator
with
a
hurrah
which
imitated
the
bellowing
of
a
bull
while
the
manager
with
andalusian
gravity
stretched
out
his
hand
congratulating
him
here
shake
it
you
have
been
very
good
as
good
as
castelar
the
señora
angustias
was
extremely
angry
at
hearing
such
things
in
her
house
feeling
that
as
an
old
woman
she
must
be
drawing
near
to
the
end
of
her
life
shut
up
sebastian
shut
up
your
infernal
mouth
cursed
one
or
i
shall
turn
you
out
of
doors
if
i
did
not
know
that
you
are
an
honest
man
however
she
soon
forgave
the
banderillero
when
she
thought
of
his
affection
for
juan
and
remembered
how
he
had
acted
in
moments
of
danger
besides
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
and
to
carmen
that
so
serious
and
a
man
should
belong
to
the
cuadrilla
with
the
other
lads
for
the
espada
left
to
himself
was
extremely
light
of
character
and
easily
drawn
away
by
his
desire
for
admiration
from
women
the
enemy
of
adam
and
eve
held
a
secret
of
his
master
which
made
him
reserved
and
grave
when
he
saw
him
in
his
own
house
between
his
mother
and
carmen
if
those
women
only
knew
what
he
knew
in
spite
of
the
respect
that
every
banderillero
ought
to
pay
his
master
el
nacional
had
one
day
ventured
to
speak
to
gallardo
taking
advantage
of
his
seniority
in
years
and
of
their
very
old
friendship
listen
to
me
juaniyo
all
seville
knows
about
it
nothing
else
is
spoken
of
and
the
news
will
get
to
your
house
and
cause
a
ruction
that
will
singe
the
good
god
hair
just
think
the
señora
angustias
will
put
on
a
face
like
the
mater
dolorosa
and
poor
carmen
will
get
in
a
rage
remember
the
row
about
that
singer
and
that
was
nothing
to
this
this
bicho
is
far
more
dangerous
so
beware
gallardo
pretended
not
to
understand
feeling
annoyed
but
flattered
at
the
same
time
that
all
seville
should
be
aware
of
the
secret
of
his
amours
but
who
is
this
what
are
these
rows
you
speak
of
who
should
it
be
doña
sol
that
great
lady
who
gives
every
one
so
much
cause
for
gossip
the
niece
of
the
marquis
de
moraima
the
breeder
and
as
the
espada
remained
silent
but
smiling
delighted
to
find
el
nacional
so
well
informed
the
latter
went
on
like
a
preacher
disillusioned
of
the
vanities
of
life
a
married
man
ought
to
seek
before
everything
else
the
peace
of
his
household
all
women
are
just
the
same
rubbish
one
is
worth
just
as
much
as
the
other
and
it
is
a
folly
to
embitter
your
life
by
flying
from
one
to
another
your
servant
for
the
years
he
has
lived
with
his
teresa
has
never
deceived
her
once
even
in
thought
and
yet
i
too
am
a
torero
and
have
had
my
good
times
and
many
a
girl
has
cast
sheep
eyes
at
me
gallardo
laughed
outright
at
the
banderillero
lecture
he
really
spoke
like
the
prior
of
a
convent
and
yet
it
was
he
who
wished
to
gobble
up
all
the
friars
alive
nacional
do
be
an
idiot
every
one
is
as
he
is
and
if
the
women
come
to
us
well
then
let
them
come
one
lives
so
short
a
time
and
possibly
some
day
i
may
be
carried
out
of
the
circus
feet
foremost
besides
you
do
not
know
what
a
great
lady
is
if
only
you
could
see
that
woman
presently
he
added
ingenuously
as
though
he
wished
to
disperse
the
sad
and
shocked
look
on
el
nacional
face
i
love
carmen
dearly
you
know
it
i
love
her
as
much
as
ever
but
i
love
the
other
one
too
it
is
quite
another
thing
i
can
not
explain
it
it
is
quite
another
thing
and
that
is
all
and
the
banderillero
could
get
no
more
out
of
his
interview
with
gallardo
months
before
as
the
end
of
the
season
was
approaching
with
the
autumn
gallardo
had
had
an
accidental
encounter
in
the
church
of
san
lorenzo
he
rested
a
few
days
in
seville
before
going
to
la
rinconada
with
his
family
when
this
quiet
time
came
round
nothing
pleased
him
better
than
to
live
quietly
in
his
own
house
free
from
those
perpetual
journeys
in
the
train
killing
more
than
a
hundred
bulls
a
year
with
all
the
dangers
and
exertions
of
the
fight
did
not
fatigue
him
half
so
much
as
those
journeys
lasting
so
many
months
from
one
plaza
to
another
all
over
spain
those
long
journeys
in
full
summer
under
a
burning
sun
over
scorched
plains
in
old
carriages
of
which
the
roofs
seemed
on
fire
were
most
exhausting
the
large
water
jar
belonging
to
the
cuadrilla
which
was
filled
at
every
station
utterly
failed
to
quench
their
thirst
besides
the
trains
were
crowded
with
passengers
country
people
going
to
the
towns
to
enjoy
the
fairs
and
see
the
corridas
many
a
time
gallardo
after
killing
his
last
bull
in
a
plaza
fearing
to
lose
his
train
and
still
dressed
in
his
gala
costume
had
rushed
down
to
the
station
like
a
flash
of
gold
and
colours
through
the
crowds
of
travellers
and
piles
of
luggage
often
he
had
changed
his
clothes
in
the
carriage
under
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
passengers
pleased
at
travelling
with
such
a
celebrity
and
had
spent
a
restless
night
on
the
cushions
while
the
others
squeezed
themselves
together
to
give
him
as
much
room
as
possible
these
people
respected
his
fatigue
thinking
that
on
the
morrow
this
man
would
give
them
the
pleasure
of
a
perhaps
tragic
emotion
without
the
slightest
danger
to
themselves
when
he
arrived
wearied
out
at
a
town
en
fête
the
streets
decorated
with
flags
and
triumphal
arches
he
had
to
endure
all
the
torment
of
enthusiastic
admiration
the
amateurs
bewitched
by
his
name
met
him
at
the
station
and
accompanied
him
to
the
hotel
these
people
who
had
slept
well
and
who
mobbed
him
expected
to
find
him
expansive
and
loquacious
as
if
the
very
fact
alone
of
seeing
them
must
cause
him
the
greatest
of
pleasures
many
times
there
was
not
only
one
he
had
to
fight
on
three
or
four
successive
days
and
the
espada
when
night
came
exhausted
by
fatigue
by
want
of
sleep
and
recent
emotions
would
throw
conventionalities
overboard
and
sit
in
his
shirt
sleeves
in
front
of
his
hotel
to
enjoy
the
cool
the
lads
of
the
cuadrilla
who
were
lodged
in
the
same
hotel
remained
near
their
master
like
schoolboys
in
durance
vile
sometimes
the
boldest
spirit
would
beg
leave
to
take
a
turn
through
the
illuminated
streets
and
the
fair
there
are
muira
bulls
said
the
espada
i
know
what
these
turns
mean
you
will
come
back
at
dawn
having
taken
a
few
glasses
too
much
or
done
something
else
which
will
impair
your
vigour
no
no
one
goes
out
you
shall
have
your
fill
when
we
have
done
when
their
work
was
ended
if
they
had
a
free
day
before
going
on
to
the
next
corrida
in
another
town
the
cuadrilla
would
postpone
their
journey
then
they
would
indulge
in
dissolute
merriment
away
from
their
families
in
company
of
the
enthusiastic
amateurs
who
imagined
that
this
was
the
usual
way
of
life
of
their
idols
the
dates
of
the
corridas
obliged
the
espada
to
take
ridiculous
journeys
he
would
go
from
one
town
to
fight
at
the
other
end
of
spain
three
or
four
days
afterwards
he
would
retrace
his
steps
to
fight
in
a
town
close
to
the
first
so
that
as
the
summer
months
were
most
abundant
in
corridas
he
virtually
spent
the
whole
of
them
in
the
train
travelling
in
zigzags
over
every
railway
in
the
peninsula
killing
bulls
by
day
and
sleeping
in
the
trains
if
all
my
journeys
in
the
summer
were
set
in
a
straight
line
said
gallardo
they
would
assuredly
reach
to
the
north
pole
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
he
undertook
those
journeys
gaily
enough
thinking
of
the
audiences
who
had
talked
of
him
the
whole
year
and
who
were
impatiently
expecting
his
arrival
he
thought
of
the
unexpected
acquaintances
he
might
make
of
the
adventures
that
feminine
curiosity
might
bring
him
of
the
life
in
different
hotels
in
which
the
disturbances
the
annoyances
and
the
diversity
of
meals
made
such
a
contrast
to
his
placid
existence
in
seville
or
the
mountainous
solitude
of
la
rinconada
but
after
a
few
weeks
of
this
dizzy
life
during
which
he
earned
five
thousand
pesetas
for
each
afternoon
work
gallardo
began
to
fret
like
a
child
away
from
his
family
ay
for
my
house
in
seville
so
cool
and
kept
like
a
silver
cup
by
poor
carmen
ay
for
the
mother
good
stews
so
on
his
return
home
to
rest
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
gallardo
experienced
the
satisfaction
of
a
celebrated
man
who
forgetful
of
his
honours
can
give
himself
over
to
the
enjoyment
of
everyday
life
he
would
sleep
late
free
from
the
worry
of
railway
and
the
anxiety
of
thinking
about
bulls
nothing
to
do
that
day
nor
the
next
nor
the
next
none
of
his
journeys
need
be
further
than
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
or
the
plaza
de
san
fernando
the
family
too
seemed
quite
different
gayer
and
in
better
health
now
they
knew
he
was
safe
at
home
for
several
months
he
would
go
out
with
his
felt
hat
well
back
swinging
his
cane
and
admiring
the
big
diamonds
on
his
fingers
in
the
vestibule
several
men
would
be
standing
waiting
for
him
close
to
the
wicket
through
the
ironwork
of
which
could
be
seen
the
white
and
luminous
patio
so
beautifully
clean
many
of
them
were
men
reeking
of
perspiration
in
dirty
blouses
and
wide
sombreros
with
ragged
edges
some
were
agricultural
labourers
moving
or
on
a
journey
who
on
passing
through
seville
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
to
come
and
ask
for
help
from
the
famous
matador
whom
they
called
don
juan
some
were
fellow
townsmen
who
addressed
him
as
thou
and
called
him
juaniyo
gallardo
with
his
wonderful
memory
for
faces
gained
by
constantly
mixing
with
crowds
would
recognise
them
they
were
or
companions
of
his
vagabond
childhood
so
affairs
are
not
going
on
well
eh
times
are
hard
for
every
one
and
before
this
familiarity
could
tempt
them
to
further
intimacies
he
would
turn
to
garabato
who
held
the
wicket
open
go
and
tell
the
señora
to
give
each
of
them
a
couple
of
pesetas
and
he
went
out
into
the
street
pleased
with
his
own
generosity
and
the
beauty
of
life
at
the
tavern
close
by
montañe
children
and
his
customers
would
come
to
the
door
smiling
with
their
eyes
full
of
curiosity
gentlemen
i
thank
you
for
your
civility
but
i
do
not
drink
and
freeing
himself
from
the
enthusiast
who
came
towards
him
glass
in
hand
he
walked
on
being
stopped
in
the
next
street
by
two
old
women
friends
of
his
mother
they
begged
him
to
stand
godfather
to
the
grandchild
of
one
of
them
her
poor
daughter
might
be
confined
at
any
moment
but
her
a
furious
gallardist
who
had
often
come
to
blows
to
defend
his
idol
as
he
came
out
of
the
plaza
had
not
dared
to
ask
him
but
confound
you
do
you
take
me
for
a
child
nurse
i
have
already
more
godchildren
than
there
are
foundlings
in
the
hospital
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
good
ladies
he
advised
them
to
go
and
talk
it
over
with
his
mother
hear
what
she
had
to
say
about
it
and
he
walked
on
never
stopping
till
he
got
to
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
saluting
some
and
allowing
others
to
enjoy
the
honour
of
walking
by
his
side
in
proud
friendship
under
the
eyes
of
the
he
looked
in
for
a
moment
at
the
club
of
the
to
see
if
his
manager
were
there
this
was
a
very
aristocratic
club
and
as
its
name
indicated
limited
as
to
numbers
in
which
nothing
was
talked
of
save
horses
and
bulls
it
was
composed
of
rich
amateurs
and
breeders
among
whom
figured
as
an
oracle
in
the
first
rank
the
marquis
de
moraima
during
one
of
these
walks
on
a
friday
afternoon
gallardo
who
was
going
towards
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
felt
a
wish
to
enter
the
church
of
san
lorenzo
in
the
little
square
were
drawn
up
several
sumptuous
carriages
all
the
best
people
in
the
town
were
going
on
that
day
to
pray
to
the
miraculous
image
of
our
father
jesus
of
great
power
the
ladies
descended
from
their
carriages
dressed
in
black
with
rich
mantillas
and
several
men
also
went
into
the
church
attracted
by
the
feminine
concourse
gallardo
also
entered
for
a
torero
ought
to
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
rub
shoulders
with
people
of
high
position
the
son
of
señora
angustias
felt
a
triumphant
pride
when
wealthy
men
saluted
him
and
elegant
ladies
murmured
his
name
indicating
him
with
their
eyes
besides
he
was
a
devotee
of
the
lord
of
great
power
if
he
tolerated
el
nacional
opinions
about
god
nature
without
being
very
much
shocked
it
was
because
for
him
divinity
was
something
vague
and
undecided
something
like
the
existence
of
a
great
lord
against
whom
one
may
hear
every
sort
of
calmly
because
one
only
knows
of
him
by
hearsay
but
it
was
quite
another
affair
with
the
virgin
of
hope
and
jesus
of
great
power
he
had
known
them
since
his
childhood
and
these
no
one
should
touch
his
feelings
as
a
rough
fellow
were
touched
by
the
theatrical
agony
of
christ
with
his
cross
on
his
back
the
perspiring
agonized
and
livid
face
reminded
him
of
some
of
his
comrades
whom
he
had
seen
lying
in
the
infirmary
one
must
stand
well
with
that
powerful
lord
and
he
recited
fervently
several
paternosters
as
he
stood
before
the
image
the
lights
of
whose
wax
tapers
were
reflected
like
stars
on
the
whites
of
his
moorish
eyes
a
rustle
among
the
women
kneeling
before
him
distracted
his
attention
greedy
of
supernatural
interventions
in
his
dangerous
life
a
lady
was
passing
through
the
kneeling
devotees
and
attracting
their
attention
she
was
tall
slight
and
of
startling
beauty
dressed
in
light
colours
with
a
dark
hat
covered
with
feathers
beneath
which
flamed
the
shining
gold
of
her
hair
gallardo
recognized
her
it
was
doña
sol
the
niece
of
the
marquis
de
moraima
the
ambassadress
as
she
was
called
in
seville
she
passed
through
the
women
taking
no
notice
of
their
curiosity
but
pleased
at
their
glances
and
their
murmured
words
as
if
these
were
a
natural
homage
due
to
her
wherever
she
appeared
the
foreign
elegance
of
her
dress
and
the
enormous
hat
stood
out
from
among
the
dark
mass
of
mantillas
she
knelt
and
bent
her
head
for
an
instant
in
prayer
and
then
her
clear
eyes
of
a
greenish
blue
with
golden
lights
wandered
tranquilly
through
the
church
as
though
she
were
in
a
theatre
seeking
for
friends
among
the
audience
her
eyes
seemed
to
smile
when
they
lighted
on
a
friend
and
pursuing
their
wanderings
they
at
last
met
those
of
gallardo
fixed
on
her
the
espada
was
not
modest
accustomed
to
see
himself
the
object
of
contemplation
by
thousands
and
thousands
of
eyes
on
the
afternoon
of
a
corrida
he
thought
frankly
that
wherever
he
was
all
looks
must
necessarily
be
directed
towards
himself
many
women
in
confidential
hours
had
told
him
of
the
emotion
the
curiosity
and
the
desire
that
had
seized
them
the
first
time
they
had
seen
him
in
the
circus
doña
sol
eyes
did
not
fall
as
they
met
those
of
the
torero
on
the
contrary
she
continued
to
stare
at
him
with
the
coldness
of
a
great
lady
and
it
was
the
matador
always
respectful
to
the
rich
who
at
last
turned
his
eyes
away
what
a
woman
thought
he
with
his
vanity
as
a
popular
idol
will
that
gachi
be
for
me
outside
the
church
he
felt
it
impossible
to
go
away
and
so
as
to
see
her
again
he
waited
by
the
door
his
heart
told
him
something
was
happening
as
on
the
afternoons
of
his
greatest
successes
it
was
the
same
mysterious
which
made
him
disregard
the
protests
of
the
public
throwing
himself
daringly
into
the
greatest
risks
and
always
with
splendid
results
when
she
in
her
turn
came
out
she
looked
at
him
again
without
surprise
as
if
she
had
guessed
he
would
be
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
she
mounted
into
her
carriage
accompanied
by
two
friends
and
as
the
coachman
started
the
horses
she
again
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him
and
a
slight
smile
passed
over
her
lips
gallardo
felt
preoccupied
all
the
afternoon
he
thought
of
his
previous
amours
of
the
triumphs
his
proud
bearing
as
a
torero
had
given
him
conquests
that
had
filled
him
with
pride
making
him
think
himself
invincible
but
that
now
inspired
him
with
shame
but
a
woman
like
this
a
great
lady
who
after
travelling
throughout
europe
now
lived
in
seville
like
a
queen
that
would
indeed
be
a
conquest
to
his
wonder
at
doña
sol
beauty
he
added
the
instinctive
respect
of
the
former
vagabond
who
in
a
country
where
birth
and
wealth
have
such
great
prestige
had
learned
to
worship
the
great
from
his
cradle
if
only
he
could
succeed
in
attracting
the
attention
of
such
a
woman
what
greater
triumph
could
he
have
his
manager
a
great
friend
of
the
marquis
de
moraima
and
well
in
with
all
the
best
sets
in
seville
had
sometimes
spoken
to
him
of
doña
sol
after
an
absence
of
some
years
she
had
returned
to
seville
a
few
months
previously
after
her
long
stay
abroad
she
was
enamoured
of
all
the
habits
and
popular
customs
of
the
country
pronouncing
them
all
very
interesting
and
very
artistic
she
went
to
the
in
the
ancient
maja
costume
imitating
the
manners
and
dress
of
the
graceful
ladies
painted
by
goya
she
was
a
strong
woman
accustomed
to
all
sports
and
a
great
rider
and
the
people
saw
her
galloping
in
the
outskirts
of
seville
in
a
dark
riding
habit
a
red
cravat
and
a
white
felt
hat
poised
on
the
golden
glory
of
her
hair
often
too
she
carried
the
garrocha
across
her
saddle
and
with
a
party
of
friends
as
picadors
would
ride
out
to
the
pastures
to
spear
and
overthrow
bulls
delighting
in
this
rough
sport
so
full
of
danger
she
was
not
a
girl
gallardo
remembered
dimly
having
seen
her
in
her
childhood
in
the
gardens
of
las
delicias
seated
by
the
side
of
her
mother
a
mass
of
white
frills
while
he
poor
little
wretch
ran
underneath
the
carriage
wheels
to
pick
up
cigar
ends
no
doubt
she
was
the
same
age
as
himself
nearing
the
thirties
but
how
magnificent
how
different
from
all
other
women
don
josé
was
well
acquainted
with
her
history
a
little
off
her
head
that
doña
sol
and
her
romantic
name
agreed
well
with
the
originality
of
her
character
and
the
independence
of
her
habits
on
the
death
of
her
mother
she
became
possessed
of
a
very
good
fortune
she
had
married
in
madrid
a
personage
much
older
than
herself
who
had
as
ambassador
represented
spain
at
the
principal
courts
of
europe
a
prospect
which
could
not
fail
to
be
attractive
to
a
woman
anxious
for
splendour
and
novelty
how
that
woman
has
amused
herself
juan
said
the
manager
how
many
heads
she
has
turned
during
the
ten
years
she
has
travelled
about
europe
she
must
be
really
a
book
on
geography
with
secret
notes
on
every
page
certainly
she
must
have
a
fine
crop
of
memories
about
every
capital
in
europe
and
the
poor
ambassador
he
died
no
doubt
from
vexation
as
there
was
nowhere
left
for
him
to
go
to
she
flew
very
high
too
the
good
gentleman
would
be
sent
to
represent
us
at
some
court
or
other
and
before
the
year
was
out
the
queen
or
the
empress
would
be
writing
home
to
beg
for
the
removal
of
the
ambassador
and
his
seductive
wife
oh
the
crowned
heads
that
gachi
has
turned
queens
trembled
at
her
arrival
finally
the
poor
ambassador
finding
no
place
open
to
him
except
the
american
republics
and
as
he
was
of
good
principles
and
a
friend
of
kings
died
and
do
imagine
for
a
moment
that
she
contented
herself
only
with
people
living
in
royal
palaces
if
all
that
is
told
of
her
be
true
everything
she
does
is
most
extreme
everything
or
nothing
sometimes
fixing
on
the
highest
sometimes
on
the
lowest
in
the
land
i
have
been
told
that
in
russia
she
ran
after
one
of
those
fellows
who
throw
bombs
who
did
not
care
much
for
her
because
she
disturbed
his
plots
because
she
followed
him
everywhere
till
at
last
his
secret
society
strangled
him
afterwards
she
appears
to
have
taken
up
with
a
painter
in
paris
but
possibly
these
may
be
exaggerations
however
it
seems
quite
certain
that
she
was
great
friends
with
some
musician
in
germany
who
writes
operas
if
you
could
only
hear
her
play
the
piano
and
when
she
sings
it
is
like
one
of
the
sopranos
who
come
to
san
fernando
theatre
at
eastertide
and
she
not
only
sings
in
italian
but
in
french
german
and
english
her
uncle
the
marquis
de
moraima
who
between
ourselves
is
just
a
little
rough
says
he
even
suspects
she
knows
latin
what
a
woman
eh
juanillo
what
an
interesting
woman
don
josé
spoke
of
doña
sol
with
admiration
thinking
every
act
of
her
life
extraordinary
and
original
those
that
were
certain
as
well
as
those
that
were
hazy
in
seville
continued
he
she
leads
an
exemplary
life
for
which
reason
i
think
a
great
deal
that
has
been
said
about
her
is
untrue
the
calumnies
of
certain
people
who
found
the
grapes
were
sour
she
appears
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
sevillian
life
as
though
she
had
never
seen
it
before
with
our
warm
sunny
climate
with
our
picturesque
customs
she
has
been
made
a
member
of
the
charitable
brotherhood
of
the
cristo
de
triana
and
spends
a
fortune
on
manzanilla
for
the
brothers
some
nights
she
fills
her
house
with
singers
and
dancers
who
bring
their
families
and
even
their
most
distant
relations
they
all
fill
themselves
with
olives
sausages
and
wine
and
doña
sol
seated
in
an
like
a
queen
spends
hours
asking
for
dance
after
dance
her
servants
who
have
come
with
her
dressed
in
their
liveries
and
as
stiff
and
grave
as
lords
hand
round
trays
of
wine
and
sweets
to
these
dancers
who
pull
their
whiskers
and
throw
the
olive
stones
in
their
faces
a
most
proper
and
amusing
diversion
now
doña
sol
receives
every
morning
an
old
gipsy
called
lechuzo
who
gives
her
lessons
on
the
guitar
and
so
don
josé
rambled
on
explaining
to
the
matador
all
doña
originalities
four
days
after
gallardo
had
seen
her
in
the
church
of
san
lorenzo
the
manager
came
up
to
him
in
a
café
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
and
said
mysteriously
gacho
you
are
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune
who
do
you
think
has
been
talking
to
me
about
you
and
putting
his
mouth
close
to
the
torero
ear
he
murmured
doña
sol
she
had
been
questioning
him
about
his
matador
and
had
expressed
a
wish
that
he
should
be
presented
to
her
he
was
such
an
original
type
so
thoroughly
spanish
she
says
she
has
several
times
seen
you
kill
once
in
madrid
and
in
other
places
which
i
forget
she
has
applauded
you
and
she
knows
that
you
are
very
brave
now
see
if
she
took
a
fancy
to
you
what
an
honour
you
would
be
or
something
of
the
sort
to
all
the
kings
in
europe
gallardo
smiled
modestly
dropping
his
eyes
but
at
the
same
time
he
drew
up
his
fine
figure
as
if
he
did
not
consider
his
hypothesis
at
all
extraordinary
or
out
of
the
way
but
all
the
same
you
must
have
no
delusions
juanillo

don
josé
doña
sol
wants
to
see
a
torero

just
as
she
takes
lessons
from
old
lechuzo

colour
and
nothing
more
bring
him
with
you
to
tablada
the
day
after
she
said

marquis
has
arranged
for
his
niece
amusement

will
go
together
for
i
also
am
invited
two
days
afterwards
the
maestro
and
his
manager
rode
out
in
the
afternoon
through
the
suburb
de
la
feria
dressed
as
garrochistas
amid
the
expectant
crowd
who
had
assembled
at
the
gate
or
were
loitering
in
the
streets
they
are
going
to
tablada
they
said
there
is
a
of
cattle
don
josé
riding
a
bony
white
mare
was
in
country
dress
a
rough
coat
cloth
breeches
with
yellow
gaiters
and
over
the
breeches
those
leather
leggings
called
zajones
the
espada
had
put
on
for
this
festivity
the
bizarre
costume
that
the
ancient
toreros
used
to
wear
before
modern
habits
had
made
them
dress
like
every
one
else
on
his
head
he
wore
a
small
round
hat
with
turned
up
edges
made
of
rough
velvet
fastened
under
the
chin
by
a
strap
the
collar
of
his
shirt
which
had
no
cravat
was
fastened
by
two
diamonds
and
two
other
larger
ones
flashed
on
his
goffered
shirt
frills
the
jacket
and
waistcoat
were
of
wine
coloured
velvet
with
black
tags
and
braidings
the
sash
was
of
crimson
silk
the
breeches
with
dark
embroideries
showed
off
to
advantage
the
torero
muscular
thighs
and
were
tied
at
the
knees
by
black
garters
with
large
ribbon
bows
the
gaiters
were
amber
coloured
with
leather
fringes
hanging
the
whole
length
of
the
opening
his
boots
of
the
same
colour
were
almost
hidden
in
the
large
moorish
stirrups
leaving
only
the
large
silver
spurs
visible
on
his
saddle
bow
above
the
rich
jerez
blanket
whose
coloured
tassels
danced
right
and
left
on
the
horse
back
was
strapped
a
grey
overcoat
with
black
trimmings
and
a
scarlet
lining
the
two
riders
galloped
along
carrying
the
garrocha
of
fine
strong
wood
over
their
shoulders
like
a
lance
with
a
ball
at
the
end
to
protect
the
iron
point
they
received
quite
an
ovation
as
they
rode
through
the
suburb
olé
the
brave
men
and
the
women
waved
their
hands
may
god
go
with
you
fine
fellow
enjoy
yourself
señor
juan
they
spurred
their
horses
to
leave
behind
the
swarm
of
children
running
after
them
and
the
little
streets
with
their
blueish
pavement
and
white
walls
rang
with
the
rhythm
of
the
horses
hoofs
in
the
quiet
street
where
doña
sol
lived
a
street
of
aristocratic
houses
with
curved
ironwork
gratings
and
large
glazed
balconies
they
found
the
other
garrochistas
who
were
waiting
at
the
door
motionless
in
their
saddles
and
leaning
on
their
lances
they
were
mostly
young
men
relations
or
friends
of
doña
sol
who
saluted
the
torero
with
courteous
amiability
pleased
that
he
should
be
of
the
party
at
last
the
marquis
de
moraima
came
out
of
the
house
and
mounted
his
horse
immediately
my
niece
will
be
down
directly
women
you
know
they
are
never
ready
he
said
this
with
the
sententious
gravity
with
which
he
always
spoke
as
if
his
words
were
oracles
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
with
large
white
whiskers
but
his
eyes
and
mouth
preserved
an
almost
childlike
ingenuousness
courteous
and
measured
in
his
language
quick
in
his
gestures
seldom
smiling
he
was
quite
a
great
nobleman
of
the
olden
days
clad
almost
always
in
riding
dress
he
hated
town
life
bored
by
the
social
obligations
that
his
rank
imposed
on
him
when
he
was
in
seville
longing
to
range
the
country
with
his
farmers
and
herdsmen
whom
he
treated
familiarly
as
comrades
he
had
almost
forgotten
how
to
write
from
want
of
practice
but
when
anyone
spoke
to
him
of
fighting
bulls
of
the
rearing
of
horses
and
bulls
or
of
agricultural
work
his
eyes
sparkled
with
determination
and
you
recognised
at
once
the
great
connoisseur
some
clouds
passed
over
the
sun
and
the
golden
light
faded
from
the
white
walls
of
the
street
some
looked
up
at
the
sky
to
the
narrow
strip
of
blue
visible
between
the
two
lines
of
roofs
do
not
be
uneasy
said
the
marquis
gravely
as
i
came
out
of
the
house
i
saw
the
wind
blowing
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
direction
i
know
it
will
not
rain
every
one
seemed
reassured
it
could
not
rain
as
the
marquis
had
said
it
would
not
he
knew
the
weather
just
as
well
as
an
old
shepherd
and
there
was
no
danger
of
his
being
mistaken
then
he
came
up
to
gallardo
this
year
i
shall
provide
you
with
magnificent
corridas
what
bulls
we
shall
see
if
you
will
kill
them
like
good
christians
last
year
you
know
i
was
not
at
all
pleased
the
poor
brutes
deserved
better
doña
sol
now
appeared
raising
with
one
hand
her
dark
riding
habit
beneath
which
appeared
her
high
grey
leather
riding
boots
she
wore
a
man
shirt
with
a
red
cravat
a
jacket
and
waistcoat
of
violet
velvet
and
her
small
velvet
andalusian
hat
rested
gracefully
on
her
curling
hair
she
mounted
lightly
taking
her
garrocha
from
a
servant
while
she
saluted
her
friends
apologizing
for
having
kept
them
waiting
her
eyes
were
watching
gallardo
don
josé
pricked
on
his
horse
to
make
the
presentation
but
doña
sol
was
beforehand
with
him
going
up
to
the
torero
gallardo
felt
perturbed
by
the
lady
presence
what
a
woman
what
would
she
say
to
him
he
saw
that
she
held
out
a
delicate
scented
hand
and
in
his
bewilderment
he
only
knew
that
he
seized
and
pressed
it
in
the
strong
grasp
used
to
overthrowing
bulls
but
the
hand
so
white
and
pink
was
not
crushed
in
the
rough
involuntary
grip
which
would
have
made
another
cry
out
with
pain
but
after
a
strong
clasp
it
disengaged
itself
easily
i
thank
you
much
for
having
come
delighted
to
know
you
and
gallardo
in
his
flurry
feeling
that
he
must
answer
something
stammered
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
an
amateur
thanks
and
the
family
quite
well
a
little
ripple
of
laughter
from
doña
sol
was
lost
in
the
clatter
of
the
hoofs
in
the
noise
of
their
first
start
the
lady
put
her
horse
to
a
trot
and
the
cavalcade
of
riders
followed
her
gallardo
unable
to
get
over
his
stupefaction
bringing
up
the
rear
feeling
dimly
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
they
galloped
through
the
outskirts
of
seville
alongside
the
river
leaving
the
torre
del
oro
behind
them
and
then
on
through
the
shady
gardens
strewn
with
yellow
sand
till
they
reached
a
road
bordered
on
either
side
by
small
taverns
and
when
they
arrived
at
tablada
they
saw
on
the
green
plain
a
large
concourse
of
people
and
carriages
drawn
up
close
to
the
palisades
which
separated
the
meadow
from
the
animals
enclosure
the
broad
stream
of
the
guadalquivir
rolled
along
the
edge
of
the
pasture
on
the
opposite
side
rose
the
hill
of
san
juan
de
aznalfarache
crowned
by
its
ruined
castle
and
many
white
country
houses
peeped
out
from
among
the
silver
grey
of
the
olive
trees
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wide
horizon
on
which
a
few
woolly
clouds
were
floating
lay
seville
the
line
of
its
houses
dominated
by
the
imposing
mass
of
the
cathedral
and
the
marvellous
giralda
dyed
a
tender
pink
in
the
evening
light
the
riders
advanced
with
no
little
trouble
among
the
moving
crowd
the
curiosity
inspired
by
doña
sol
originalities
had
attracted
all
the
ladies
of
seville
her
friends
saluted
her
as
she
passed
their
carriages
thinking
she
looked
very
beautiful
in
her
manly
dress
her
relations
the
marquis
daughters
some
unmarried
others
accompanied
by
their
husbands
recommended
prudence
for
god
sake
sol
do
not
risk
anything
the
derribadores
entered
into
the
enclosure
being
greeted
as
they
went
through
the
palings
by
the
shouts
of
the
populace
who
had
come
to
see
the
sport
the
horses
seeing
their
enemies
and
sniffing
them
from
afar
began
to
prance
neighing
and
kicking
beneath
the
firm
hands
of
their
riders
the
bulls
were
in
the
centre
in
a
group
some
were
quietly
grazing
while
others
lay
sleepily
ruminating
on
the
grass
which
was
a
little
rusted
by
the
winter
others
wilder
trotted
towards
the
river
the
old
oxen
the
prudent
cabestros
immediately
starting
in
pursuit
the
big
bells
round
their
necks
ringing
while
the
cowherds
assisted
them
in
collecting
the
stragglers
by
slinging
stones
which
struck
the
tips
of
the
fugitives
horns
the
riders
remained
a
long
time
motionless
holding
a
council
under
the
impatient
eyes
of
the
crowd
who
were
longing
for
something
exciting
the
first
to
ride
out
was
the
marquis
accompanied
by
one
of
his
friends
the
two
galloped
towards
the
group
of
bulls
and
when
within
a
short
distance
stopped
their
horses
standing
up
in
their
stirrups
waving
their
garrochas
and
shouting
loudly
to
frighten
them
a
black
bull
with
powerful
thighs
detached
himself
from
the
rest
trotting
to
the
further
end
of
the
enclosure
the
marquis
had
every
right
to
be
proud
of
his
herd
composed
entirely
of
fine
animals
carefully
selected
from
judicious
crossing
they
were
not
animals
destined
only
for
the
production
of
meat
with
rough
and
dirty
coats
big
hoofs
hanging
heads
and
large
and
horns
they
were
animals
of
nervous
vivacity
strong
and
robust
making
the
ground
shake
as
they
went
along
raising
clouds
of
dust
under
their
hoofs
their
coats
were
fine
and
shining
like
horses
their
eyes
fiery
the
neck
broad
and
proudly
carried
their
legs
short
their
tails
long
and
fine
their
horns
well
shaped
sharp
and
polished
as
if
by
hand
and
their
hoofs
short
small
and
round
but
hard
enough
to
cut
the
grass
like
a
steel
the
two
riders
galloped
after
the
animal
attacking
him
from
either
side
barring
his
way
as
he
tried
to
make
for
the
river
till
the
marquis
spurring
his
horse
gained
on
him
and
nearing
the
bull
with
his
garrocha
in
front
of
him
drove
the
iron
on
to
his
croup
the
combined
impetus
of
the
horse
and
the
rider
arm
causing
him
to
lose
his
balance
and
roll
over
on
the
ground
belly
upwards
his
horns
stuck
in
the
ground
and
his
four
legs
in
the
air
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
the
breeder
had
accomplished
this
feat
raised
shouts
of
delight
from
the
other
side
of
the
paling
olé
for
the
old
men
no
one
understood
bulls
like
the
marquis
he
managed
them
as
if
they
were
his
own
children
tending
them
from
the
day
they
were
born
till
the
day
they
entered
the
plazas
to
die
like
heroes
worthy
of
a
better
fate
immediately
other
riders
wished
to
go
out
and
gain
the
applause
of
the
crowd
but
the
marquis
stopped
them
giving
the
preference
to
his
niece
if
she
wished
to
accomplish
a
derribo
she
had
better
go
out
at
once
before
the
herd
got
infuriated
with
the
constant
attacks
doña
sol
spurred
her
horse
which
did
not
cease
rearing
frightened
by
the
bulls
the
marquis
wished
to
accompany
her
but
she
refused
his
escort
no
she
preferred
having
gallardo
who
was
a
torero
where
was
gallardo
the
matador
still
ashamed
of
his
awkwardness
rode
up
to
the
lady
side
in
silence
the
two
galloped
towards
the
herd
doña
sol
horse
reared
up
frequently
refusing
to
go
on
but
the
strength
of
the
rider
forced
him
to
advance
gallardo
waved
his
garrocha
giving
shouts
that
were
really
bellowings
just
as
he
did
in
the
plazas
when
he
wished
to
excite
the
animal
to
attack
him
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
one
animal
come
out
from
the
rest
a
huge
white
bull
with
red
spots
an
enormous
neck
and
hanging
brisket
with
horns
of
the
finest
point
soon
detached
himself
he
trotted
to
the
further
end
of
the
enclosure
as
if
he
had
there
his
querencia
which
irresistibly
attracted
him
doña
sol
galloped
after
him
followed
by
the
espada
take
care
señora
shouted
gallardo
this
is
an
old
and
malicious
bull
he
is
drawing
you
on
take
care
he
does
not
turn
short
and
so
it
was
when
doña
sol
prepared
to
make
the
same
stroke
as
her
uncle
turning
her
horse
obliquely
to
the
bull
so
as
to
plant
the
garrocha
well
on
his
tail
and
overthrow
him
the
brute
suddenly
turned
as
if
realizing
his
danger
planting
himself
menacingly
in
front
of
his
attackers
the
horse
rushed
in
front
of
the
bull
doña
sol
being
unable
to
stop
him
from
the
impetus
of
his
wild
career
and
the
bull
pursued
the
chaser
becoming
the
chased
the
lady
had
no
thought
of
flight
thousands
of
people
were
watching
her
from
afar
she
dreaded
the
laughter
of
her
friends
and
the
pity
of
the
men
and
succeeded
at
last
in
checking
her
horse
and
fronting
the
bull
she
held
her
garrocha
under
her
arm
like
a
picador
and
drove
it
into
the
bull
neck
as
it
rushed
forward
bellowing
with
lowered
head
its
enormous
poll
was
covered
with
a
stream
of
blood
but
it
rushed
on
with
an
overwhelming
impetus
not
seeming
to
care
for
the
wound
till
it
drove
its
horns
under
the
horse
belly
shaking
it
and
lifting
it
off
the
ground
the
rider
was
thrown
out
of
her
saddle
while
a
wild
cry
of
horror
went
up
from
the
palisades
the
horse
freed
from
the
horns
rushed
on
madly
its
belly
stained
with
blood
the
girths
broken
and
the
saddle
flapping
on
its
loins
the
bull
turned
to
follow
it
but
at
the
same
moment
something
nearer
attracted
its
attention
it
was
doña
sol
who
instead
of
remaining
motionless
on
the
grass
stood
up
picking
up
her
garrocha
and
putting
it
bravely
in
rest
under
her
arm
to
confront
the
brute
afresh
it
was
a
mad
display
of
courage
but
she
thought
of
those
who
were
watching
her
a
challenge
to
death
certainly
but
far
better
than
compounding
with
fear
and
incurring
ridicule
no
one
shouted
from
the
palisade
the
crowd
were
motionless
in
terrified
silence
the
groups
of
cavaliers
were
approaching
at
a
mad
gallop
but
their
help
would
come
too
late
the
bull
was
already
pawing
the
ground
with
its
forefeet
and
lowering
his
head
to
attack
that
slight
figure
threatening
him
with
her
lance
one
simple
blow
of
those
horns
and
all
would
be
over
but
at
that
instant
a
ferocious
bellowing
drew
the
attention
and
something
red
passed
before
his
eyes
like
a
flame
of
fire
it
was
gallardo
who
had
thrown
himself
off
his
horse
dropping
his
lance
to
seize
the
overcoat
strapped
on
to
his
saddle
bow
eeee
entra
and
the
bull
attacked
running
after
the
red
lining
of
the
jacket
attracted
by
this
adversary
so
worthy
of
him
turning
his
hind
quarters
to
the
figure
in
the
black
riding
skirt
and
violet
jacket
who
still
stood
stupefied
by
the
danger
with
her
lance
under
her
arm
do
not
be
afraid
doña
sol
he
is
mine
said
the
torero
pale
with
emotion
but
smiling
sure
of
his
dexterity
with
no
other
defence
but
his
jacket
he
baited
the
brute
drawing
it
away
from
the
lady
and
avoiding
its
furious
attacks
by
graceful
bendings
the
crowd
forgetting
their
previous
fright
began
to
applaud
tremendously
what
a
joy
to
have
come
to
see
a
simple
derribo
and
to
see
gratuitously
an
almost
regular
corrida
with
gallardo
fighting
the
torero
warmed
by
the
impetuosity
of
the
bull
attack
forgot
doña
sol
and
everything
else
intent
only
on
slipping
away
from
his
attacks
the
bull
turned
again
and
again
furious
at
seeing
this
invulnerable
man
slipping
away
from
between
his
horns
and
constantly
meeting
the
red
lining
of
the
coat
instead
at
last
he
was
wearied
out
and
stood
motionless
with
his
head
low
and
his
muzzle
covered
with
foam
then
gallardo
taking
advantage
of
the
brute
bewilderment
took
off
his
hat
and
laid
it
between
the
horns
an
immense
howl
of
delight
arose
from
the
palisade
greeting
this
exploit
then
shouts
and
bells
rang
out
behind
gallardo
and
a
crowd
of
herdsmen
and
bell
oxen
surrounded
the
brute
and
slowly
enticed
him
towards
the
main
body
of
the
herd
gallardo
went
in
search
of
his
horse
who
accustomed
to
being
near
bulls
had
not
moved
picked
up
his
garrocha
mounted
and
then
cantered
slowly
towards
the
palisade
prolonging
in
this
way
the
noisy
rounds
of
applause
from
the
populace
the
riders
who
had
escorted
doña
sol
greeted
the
espada
with
the
greatest
display
of
enthusiasm
his
manager
winked
at
him
and
then
whispered
mysteriously
gacho
you
have
not
been
behindhand
very
good
extremely
good
now
i
tell
you
she
is
yours
outside
the
palisade
doña
sol
was
sitting
in
a
landau
with
the
marquis
daughters
her
terrified
cousins
felt
her
all
over
determined
to
find
something
put
out
of
joint
by
her
fall
they
offered
her
glasses
of
manzanilla
to
get
over
her
fright
but
she
smiling
vaguely
received
these
evidences
of
feminine
concern
with
contemptuous
indifference
as
she
saw
gallardo
pushing
his
horse
through
the
ranks
of
people
between
waving
hats
and
outstretched
hands
she
smiled
cordially
come
here
to
me
cid
campeador
give
me
your
hand
and
once
again
their
right
hands
met
in
a
long
vigorous
clasp
that
evening
the
affair
of
which
all
seville
was
talking
was
also
much
canvassed
in
the
matador
house
the
señora
angustias
was
beaming
as
after
a
great
corrida
her
son
saving
one
of
those
great
ladies
whom
she
accustomed
to
years
of
servitude
had
always
looked
upon
with
such
deference
and
admiration
but
carmen
remained
silent
not
knowing
quite
what
to
think
of
the
occurrence
many
days
passed
without
gallardo
having
any
news
of
doña
sol
his
manager
was
out
of
town
at
a
hunting
party
with
some
of
his
friends
of
the
but
one
evening
don
josé
went
to
seek
his
matador
at
a
café
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
where
many
amateurs
of
the
sport
gathered
he
had
only
returned
a
couple
of
hours
previously
from
the
hunting
party
and
had
gone
at
once
to
doña
sol
house
in
consequence
of
a
note
which
he
had
found
waiting
for
him
god
bless
me
man
you
are
worse
than
a
wolf
said
the
manager
marching
his
man
out
of
the
café
the
lady
expected
you
at
her
house
she
has
stayed
at
home
evening
after
evening
thinking
you
might
come
at
any
moment
such
things
are
not
done
after
being
presented
and
after
what
happened
you
owed
her
a
visit
were
it
only
to
enquire
after
her
health
the
espada
stopped
scratching
his
head
under
his
felt
hat
it
is
he
murmured
uneasily
it
is
well
i
must
say
it
out
it
frightens
me
now
señor
it
is
said
yes
it
frightens
me
you
know
well
enough
i
am
no
laggard
that
i
can
carry
on
with
most
women
and
say
a
few
words
to
a
as
well
as
anyone
else
but
this
one
no
she
is
a
lady
who
knows
more
than
lepe
and
when
i
see
her
i
feel
i
am
an
ignorant
brute
and
keep
my
mouth
shut
as
i
can
not
speak
without
putting
my
foot
in
it
no
don
josé
i
am
not
going
i
ought
not
to
go
but
don
josé
ended
by
over
persuading
him
and
finally
carried
him
off
to
doña
sol
house
talking
as
he
went
of
his
interview
with
that
lady
she
seemed
rather
offended
at
gallardo
neglect
all
the
best
people
in
seville
had
been
to
see
her
after
her
accident
except
himself
you
know
that
a
torero
ought
to
stand
well
with
people
of
good
position
it
is
only
a
matter
of
having
a
little
education
and
showing
that
you
are
not
a
cowherd
brought
up
in
a
stable
just
think
a
great
lady
like
that
to
distinguish
you
and
expect
you
stuff
and
nonsense
i
shall
go
with
you
ah
if
you
go
with
me
and
gallardo
breathed
again
as
if
freed
from
the
weight
of
a
great
fear
the
patio
of
doña
sol
house
was
in
moorish
style
the
delicate
work
of
its
coloured
arches
making
one
think
of
the
alhambra
the
ripple
of
a
fountain
in
whose
basin
gold
fish
were
swimming
murmured
gently
in
the
evening
silence
in
the
four
galleries
with
ceilings
of
inlaid
moorish
work
which
were
divided
from
the
patio
by
marble
pillars
he
saw
ancient
carved
panels
dark
pictures
of
saints
with
livid
faces
ancient
furniture
with
rusty
iron
mountings
so
riddled
with
worm
holes
that
they
looked
as
if
they
had
had
a
charge
of
shot
a
servant
shewed
them
up
the
wide
marble
staircase
and
there
again
the
torero
was
surprised
to
see
retablos
with
dark
figures
on
gold
grounds
massive
virgins
who
looked
as
if
they
had
been
cut
out
with
a
hatchet
painted
in
faded
colours
and
dull
gilding
tapestries
of
soft
dead
leaf
colour
framed
in
borders
of
fruit
and
flowers
of
which
one
represented
scenes
of
calvary
while
the
other
represented
hairy
horned
and
satyrs
whom
nymphs
seemed
to
be
fighting
like
bulls
see
what
ignorance
is
said
the
matador
to
don
josé
i
thought
that
sort
of
thing
was
only
good
for
convents
but
it
seems
that
these
people
also
value
upstairs
the
electric
lamps
were
lighted
as
they
passed
while
the
sunset
splendours
still
shone
through
the
windows
gallardo
experienced
fresh
surprises
he
so
proud
of
his
furniture
bought
in
madrid
all
quilted
with
bright
silks
heavily
and
richly
carved
which
seemed
to
cry
out
the
amount
they
had
cost
could
not
get
over
seeing
light
and
fragile
chairs
white
or
green
tables
and
cupboards
of
simple
outline
walls
of
one
colour
with
only
a
few
pictures
wide
apart
hanging
by
thick
cords
a
luxury
of
which
the
beautiful
polish
seemed
due
only
to
the
finish
of
the
carpenters
work
he
was
ashamed
of
his
own
surprise
and
at
what
he
had
admired
in
his
own
house
as
supreme
luxury
see
what
ignorance
is
and
he
sat
down
with
fear
dreading
that
the
chair
would
break
under
his
weight
the
entrance
of
doña
sol
disturbed
his
reflections
he
saw
her
as
he
had
never
seen
her
before
without
either
hat
or
mantilla
her
head
crowned
by
that
shimmering
hair
which
seemed
to
justify
her
romantic
name
her
beautiful
white
arms
showed
through
the
hanging
silk
sleeves
of
a
japanese
tunic
which
also
left
uncovered
the
curve
of
her
beautiful
neck
marked
by
the
two
lines
called
venus
necklace
as
she
moved
her
hands
stones
of
all
colours
set
in
curiously
shaped
rings
which
covered
her
fingers
flashed
brilliantly
on
her
delicate
wrists
gold
bracelets
tinkled
one
of
oriental
filigree
worked
with
some
mysterious
inscription
the
others
heavy
and
massive
to
which
were
hung
various
small
charms
and
amulets
souvenirs
of
foreign
travel
when
she
sat
down
to
talk
she
crossed
her
legs
with
masculine
freedom
balancing
on
her
toe
a
small
red
papouche
like
an
embroidered
toy
gallardo
ears
were
buzzing
his
eyes
were
dim
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
two
clear
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
an
expression
at
once
caressing
and
ironical
to
conceal
his
emotion
he
smiled
showing
his
teeth
the
stiff
stereotyped
smile
of
a
child
who
wishes
to
be
amiable
no
indeed
señora
many
thanks
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
was
all
he
could
stammer
to
doña
sol
grateful
acknowledgment
of
his
exploit
the
other
evening
little
by
little
gallardo
recovered
his
calm
and
as
the
lady
and
his
manager
began
to
speak
of
bulls
he
at
last
gained
confidence
she
had
seen
him
kill
several
times
and
remembered
the
principal
incidents
with
great
exactitude
he
felt
proud
to
think
this
woman
watched
him
at
such
moments
and
had
kept
the
remembrance
fresh
in
her
memory
she
had
opened
a
lacquered
box
decorated
with
strange
flowers
and
offered
the
two
men
cigarettes
which
exhaled
a
strange
and
pungent
scent
they
have
opium
in
them
she
said
they
are
very
nice
she
lighted
one
herself
and
with
her
greenish
eyes
which
in
the
light
seemed
like
liquid
gold
she
followed
the
waving
spirals
of
smoke
the
torero
accustomed
to
strong
havanas
inhaled
the
smoke
of
this
cigarette
with
curiosity
nothing
but
straw
a
thing
to
please
ladies
but
the
strange
perfume
spread
by
the
smoke
seemed
slowly
to
dissipate
his
timidity
doña
sol
fixing
her
eyes
on
him
questioned
him
about
his
life
she
wanted
to
be
behind
the
scenes
of
glory
to
know
the
inner
lining
of
celebrity
the
miserable
and
wandering
life
of
a
torero
who
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
gaining
the
good
will
of
the
public
and
gallardo
talked
and
talked
with
sudden
confidence
telling
her
of
his
early
days
dwelling
with
proud
insistence
on
the
humbleness
of
his
origin
although
he
omitted
anything
he
considered
shameful
in
the
story
of
his
adventurous
youth
how
very
interesting
how
very
original
said
the
beautiful
woman
turning
her
eyes
from
the
torero
she
seemed
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
something
invisible
the
first
man
in
the
world
exclaimed
don
josé
with
rough
enthusiasm
believe
me
sol
there
are
not
two
men
like
him
and
how
impervious
to
wounds
as
proud
of
gallardo
strength
as
though
he
were
his
father
he
enumerated
the
different
wounds
that
gallardo
had
received
describing
them
as
if
he
saw
them
through
his
clothes
the
lady
eyes
followed
this
anatomical
journey
with
sincere
admiration
a
real
hero
simple
embarrassed
retiring
like
all
strong
men
the
manager
spoke
of
going
away
it
was
seven
and
he
would
be
expected
at
home
but
doña
sol
remonstrated
with
smiling
insistence
they
really
must
both
of
them
stay
to
dinner
it
was
an
unceremonious
invitation
but
that
evening
she
was
not
expecting
anyone
she
would
be
alone
as
the
marquis
and
his
family
had
gone
into
the
country
i
shall
be
quite
alone
not
another
word
i
command
it
you
must
do
penance
with
me
and
as
if
her
commands
admitted
of
no
reply
she
left
the
room
the
manager
demurred
he
really
could
not
stay
he
had
already
come
out
that
afternoon
and
so
his
family
had
hardly
seen
him
besides
he
had
invited
two
friends
as
far
as
concerned
his
matador
it
seemed
quite
correct
and
natural
that
he
should
stay
for
really
the
invitation
was
for
him
but
you
really
must
stay
said
the
espada
in
agony
curse
it
you
are
never
going
to
leave
me
alone
i
should
not
know
what
to
do
nor
what
to
say
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
doña
sol
returned
to
the
room
wearing
now
one
of
those
creations
of
paquin
which
were
at
once
the
despair
and
the
wonder
of
her
friends
and
relations
don
josé
persisted
he
really
must
go
it
was
unavoidable
but
his
matador
would
remain
and
he
undertook
to
let
them
know
at
his
house
that
they
were
not
to
expect
him
gallardo
made
an
agonized
gesture
but
was
a
little
quieted
by
a
look
from
his
manager
do
be
uneasy
he
whispered
as
he
went
towards
the
door
do
you
think
i
am
a
child
i
shall
say
you
are
dining
with
some
amateurs
from
madrid
what
torments
the
torero
suffered
the
first
few
moments
at
dinner
the
grave
and
seigniorial
luxury
of
the
room
intimidated
him
he
and
his
hostess
seemed
lost
in
it
sitting
opposite
to
each
other
in
the
middle
of
that
big
table
with
its
enormous
silver
candelabra
fitted
with
electric
light
and
pink
shades
the
imposing
servants
stiff
and
ceremonious
who
looked
as
if
nothing
could
upset
their
gravity
inspired
him
with
respect
he
was
ashamed
of
his
clothes
and
of
his
manners
feeling
the
great
contrast
between
the
surrounding
atmosphere
and
his
own
appearance
but
this
first
feeling
of
shyness
and
timidity
soon
vanished
and
doña
sol
laughed
at
his
abstemiousness
and
the
dread
with
which
he
touched
the
plates
and
glasses
gallardo
looked
at
her
admiringly
certainly
the
lady
had
a
fine
appetite
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
prudery
and
abstentions
of
ladies
he
had
known
who
thought
it
bad
form
to
eat
anything
he
was
astonished
at
doña
sol
appetite
gallardo
encouraged
by
her
example
ate
and
above
all
drank
drank
deeply
seeking
in
the
many
fine
wines
a
remedy
for
that
nervousness
which
had
made
him
so
shamefaced
and
unable
to
do
anything
but
smile
as
he
constantly
repeated
many
thanks
the
conversation
became
more
lively
the
espada
began
to
be
talkative
and
told
her
many
amusing
incidents
of
life
ending
by
telling
her
of
el
nacional
original
ideas
of
the
feats
of
his
picador
potaje
who
swallowed
eggs
whole
who
was
half
an
ear
short
because
a
companion
had
bitten
it
off
who
when
he
was
taken
wounded
to
the
infirmary
of
a
plaza
fell
on
the
bed
with
such
a
weight
of
iron
armour
and
muscles
that
his
big
spurs
pierced
the
mattress
and
he
had
subsequently
to
be
disentangled
with
extreme
difficulty
how
very
interesting
how
very
original
doña
sol
smiled
as
she
listened
to
the
anecdotes
of
these
rough
men
always
face
to
face
with
death
whom
she
had
hitherto
only
admired
from
a
distance
the
champagne
ended
by
bewildering
gallardo
and
when
they
rose
from
the
table
he
offered
his
arm
to
his
hostess
amazed
at
his
own
audacity
did
they
not
do
this
in
the
great
world
decidedly
he
was
not
quite
so
ignorant
as
he
had
appeared
at
first
sight
coffee
was
served
in
the
where
in
a
corner
gallardo
spied
a
guitar
no
doubt
the
one
on
which
lechuzo
gave
doña
sol
her
lessons
she
offered
it
to
him
asking
him
to
play
something
i
do
not
know
how
i
am
the
most
ignorant
man
in
the
world
except
about
killing
bulls
he
much
regretted
that
the
puntillero
of
his
cuadrilla
was
not
there
a
lad
who
drove
the
women
wild
with
his
beautiful
playing
there
was
a
long
silence
gallardo
sat
on
a
sofa
smoking
a
splendid
havana
while
doña
sol
smoked
one
of
those
cigarettes
whose
perfume
seemed
to
induce
a
vague
drowsiness
the
torero
felt
sleepy
after
his
dinner
and
scarcely
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
except
by
a
fixed
smile
doubtless
this
silence
bored
doña
sol
for
she
rose
and
went
to
the
grand
piano
which
soon
rang
under
her
vigorous
touch
with
the
rhythm
of
a
malagueña
olé
that
is
fine
said
the
torero
shaking
off
his
drowsiness
capital
very
good
after
the
malagueñas
she
played
some
sevillanas
and
then
some
andalusian
popular
songs
all
melancholy
with
an
oriental
ring
gallardo
interrupted
the
singing
with
his
exclamations
just
as
he
would
have
done
before
the
stage
of
a
café
chantant
well
done
the
golden
hands
now
for
another
are
you
fond
of
music
enquired
the
lady
oh
very
replied
gallardo
who
up
to
now
had
never
asked
himself
the
question
doña
sol
passed
slowly
from
these
lively
measures
to
something
slow
and
more
solemn
which
gallardo
with
his
philharmonic
learning
recognised
as
church
music
there
were
no
exclamations
now
he
felt
himself
overcome
by
a
delicious
sleepiness
his
eyes
were
closing
and
he
felt
certain
that
if
this
concert
went
on
much
longer
he
should
be
fast
asleep
to
prevent
this
catastrophe
gallardo
gazed
at
the
beautiful
woman
who
had
turned
her
back
to
him
mother
of
god
what
a
beautiful
figure
and
he
fixed
his
african
eyes
on
the
round
white
neck
crowned
with
the
waving
curls
of
golden
hair
an
absurd
idea
floated
before
his
confused
mind
keeping
him
awake
with
the
itching
of
its
temptation
what
would
that
gachi
do
if
i
went
up
softly
on
and
kissed
that
beautiful
neck
but
his
thoughts
went
no
further
the
woman
inspired
him
with
irresistible
respect
he
remembered
what
his
manager
had
said
and
how
she
managed
men
as
if
they
were
playthings
still
he
looked
at
that
neck
though
the
mist
of
sleep
was
spreading
before
his
eyes
he
knew
he
would
fall
asleep
and
he
feared
that
soon
a
loud
snore
would
interrupt
that
music
which
although
quite
incomprehensible
to
him
must
be
magnificent
he
pinched
his
thighs
and
stretched
his
arms
to
keep
himself
awake
smothering
his
yawns
with
his
hand
a
long
time
passed
gallardo
was
not
quite
sure
he
had
not
been
asleep
suddenly
the
sound
of
doña
sol
voice
woke
him
from
his
drowsiness
she
was
singing
in
a
low
voice
that
trembled
with
passion
the
torero
pricked
up
his
ears
to
listen
he
could
not
understand
a
word
it
was
something
foreign
curse
it
why
could
she
not
sing
a
tango
or
something
of
the
sort
and
she
expected
a
christian
to
keep
awake
she
was
singing
as
in
a
waking
dream
elsa
prayer
the
lament
for
the
strong
man
the
great
warrior
so
invincible
to
men
so
tender
to
women
that
tender
and
strong
man
that
warrior
was
it
possibly
the
man
behind
her
why
not
he
certainly
had
not
the
legendary
aspect
of
that
other
warrior
he
was
rough
and
heavy
still
she
remembered
clearly
the
gallantry
with
which
he
had
come
to
her
aid
the
other
day
the
smiling
confidence
with
which
he
had
fought
the
bellowing
brute
just
as
the
other
heroes
fought
with
terrifying
dragons
yes
he
was
her
warrior
she
shook
from
head
to
foot
with
voluptuous
dread
acknowledging
herself
beforehand
as
conquered
she
thought
she
could
feel
the
sweet
danger
which
was
approaching
her
from
behind
she
could
see
her
hero
her
paladin
rise
from
the
sofa
with
his
moorish
eyes
fixed
on
her
she
could
hear
his
cautious
footsteps
she
could
feel
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
a
kiss
of
fire
on
her
neck
a
sign
of
passion
which
would
seal
her
for
ever
as
his
slave
but
the
romance
ended
without
anything
happening
without
her
feeling
anything
on
her
spine
beyond
the
thrill
of
her
own
trembling
desire

by
his

a
great
satisfaction
to
his
vanity
was
added
to
the
numerous
other
reasons
gallardo
had
for
being
proud
of
his
person
when
he
spoke
with
the
marquis
de
moraima
he
regarded
him
with
an
almost
filial
affection
that
gentleman
dressed
as
a
countryman
a
rough
centaur
with
zajones
and
a
strong
garrocha
was
an
illustrious
personage
who
could
cover
his
breast
with
ribbons
and
crosses
and
in
the
king
palace
wore
an
embroidered
coat
with
a
gold
key
sewn
on
to
one
flap
his
remote
ancestors
had
come
to
seville
with
that
monarch
who
had
expelled
the
moors
and
had
received
as
reward
for
their
great
exploits
immense
territories
wrested
from
the
enemy
the
remains
of
which
were
those
vast
plains
on
which
the
marquis
now
reared
his
cattle
and
this
great
nobleman
frank
and
generous
who
preserved
notwithstanding
the
simplicity
of
his
country
life
the
distinction
of
his
illustrious
ancestry
was
looked
upon
by
gallardo
as
in
some
sort
a
near
relation
the
cobbler
son
was
just
as
proud
as
if
he
had
in
reality
become
a
member
of
the
marquis
family
the
marquis
de
moraima
was
his
uncle
and
though
he
could
neither
announce
it
publicly
nor
was
the
relationship
legitimate
he
consoled
himself
by
thinking
of
the
ascendency
he
exercised
over
one
female
of
the
family
thanks
to
a
love
which
seemed
to
laugh
at
all
prejudices
of
rank
all
those
gentlemen
who
up
to
now
had
treated
him
with
the
rather
disdainful
familiarity
with
which
the
patrons
of
the
sport
of
rank
treat
toreros
were
now
in
some
sort
his
cousins
and
he
began
to
treat
them
as
equals
his
life
and
habits
had
completely
changed
he
seldom
entered
the
cafés
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
where
most
of
the
amateurs
assembled
they
were
good
sort
of
people
simple
and
enthusiastic
but
of
little
importance
small
tradesmen
workmen
who
had
become
employers
small
clerks
nondescripts
without
profession
who
lived
miraculously
by
strange
expedients
apparently
having
no
other
business
than
to
talk
of
bulls
gallardo
passed
by
the
windows
of
these
cafés
saluting
his
admirers
who
waved
frantically
to
him
to
come
in
i
will
return
presently
he
however
did
not
return
he
went
further
up
the
street
to
a
very
aristocratic
club
decorated
in
the
gothic
style
where
the
servants
wore
knee
breeches
and
the
tables
were
covered
with
silver
plate
the
son
of
señora
angustias
could
not
repress
a
feeling
of
pride
each
time
he
passed
through
the
rows
of
servants
drawn
up
on
either
side
like
soldiers
or
when
a
with
a
silver
chain
round
his
neck
came
to
take
his
hat
and
stick
in
one
room
fencing
was
practised
in
another
they
gambled
from
the
early
hours
of
the
afternoon
till
dawn
the
members
tolerated
gallardo
because
he
was
a
decent
torero
who
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
and
had
powerful
friends
he
is
very
well
educated
said
the
members
gravely
realizing
that
he
knew
just
about
as
much
as
they
did
the
sympathetic
personality
of
his
manager
don
josé
served
the
torero
as
a
guarantee
in
his
new
existence
besides
gallardo
with
the
cunning
of
a
former
street
urchin
knew
how
to
make
himself
popular
with
this
brilliant
set
among
whom
he
met
relations
by
the
dozen
he
played
heavily
it
was
the
best
way
of
drawing
closer
to
his
new
friends
he
played
and
lost
with
the
proverbial
of
a
man
fortunate
in
other
undertakings
and
his
became
a
matter
of
pride
to
the
club
gallardo
was
cleared
out
last
night
said
the
members
proudly
he
must
have
lost
at
least
eleven
thousand
pesetas
the
calmness
with
which
he
lost
his
money
made
his
new
friends
respect
him
but
the
new
passion
soon
grew
upon
him
even
to
the
point
of
making
him
sometimes
forget
his
great
lady
to
play
with
all
the
best
in
seville
to
find
himself
treated
as
an
equal
by
these
gentlemen
thanks
to
the
fraternity
established
by
loans
of
money
and
common
emotions
one
night
a
large
lamp
suddenly
crashed
down
on
to
the
green
table
there
was
sudden
darkness
and
wild
confusion
but
the
imperious
voice
of
gallardo
rang
out
calm
yourselves
gentlemen
nothing
much
has
happened
let
the
game
go
on
they
are
bringing
candles
and
the
game
went
on
his
companions
admiring
him
even
more
for
his
energetic
speech
than
for
the
way
in
which
he
killed
his
bulls
the
manager
friends
questioned
him
as
to
gallardo
losses
surely
he
would
ruin
himself
everything
he
earned
by
he
lost
by
gambling
but
don
josé
smiled
disdainfully
this
year
we
had
more
corridas
than
anyone
else
we
shall
become
tired
of
killing
bulls
and
piling
up
money
let
the
lad
enjoy
himself
he
works
for
this
and
is
what
he
is
the
first
man
in
the
world
in
his
new
existence
gallardo
not
only
frequented
this
club
but
some
afternoons
he
went
to
the
which
was
a
kind
of
senate
of
tauromachia
the
toreros
as
a
rule
did
not
gain
easy
access
to
its
precincts
for
their
absence
admitted
of
the
fathers
of
the
sport
giving
free
vent
to
their
various
opinions
during
the
spring
and
summer
the
members
met
in
the
vestibule
and
overflowed
into
the
street
sitting
on
cane
chairs
waiting
for
telegrams
about
the
different
corridas
they
believed
very
little
in
the
opinions
of
the
press
besides
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
have
the
news
before
it
got
into
the
papers
it
was
an
occupation
that
filled
them
with
pride
and
elevated
them
above
their
fellow
mortals
to
sit
quietly
at
the
door
of
their
club
breathing
the
fresh
air
and
knowing
exactly
without
interested
exaggerations
what
had
happened
that
afternoon
in
the
corrida
of
bilbao
coruña
barcelona
or
valencia
how
many
ears
one
matador
had
received
how
another
one
had
been
hissed
while
their
remained
in
complete
ignorance
waiting
about
the
streets
till
the
evening
papers
were
published
when
there
was
hule
and
a
telegram
came
announcing
the
terrible
wounds
of
some
native
torero
their
feelings
and
their
patriotic
solidarity
softened
them
sufficiently
to
admit
of
their
imparting
the
momentous
secret
to
some
passing
friend
the
news
flew
instantaneously
through
the
cafés
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
and
no
one
could
doubt
it
for
an
instant
for
was
it
not
a
telegram
received
by
the
gallardo
manager
with
his
aggressive
and
noisy
enthusiasm
rather
disturbed
the
social
gravity
they
endured
it
as
he
was
an
old
friend
and
ended
by
laughing
at
his
flights
but
it
was
impossible
for
sensible
men
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
various
toreros
quietly
with
don
josé
often
when
they
alluded
to
gallardo
as
a
very
brave
fellow
but
without
much
art
they
would
look
timorously
towards
the
door
hush
pepe
is
coming
and
pepe
would
enter
waving
a
telegram
above
his
head

news
from

it
is

and
the

just
what

said

in

the

to
the
often
differed
but
don
josé
would
pass
it
over
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
breaking
out
into
noisy
protests

my

is
the
true
one
what
is
in
yours
is
only
envy
because
lad
has
lowered
so
many
chignons
all
the
members
laughed
at
don
josé
lifting
a
finger
to
their
foreheads
and
joking
about
the
first
man
in
the
world
and
his
kind
manager
little
by
little
gallardo
had
succeeded
as
an
privilege
in
introducing
himself
into
this
society
the
torero
would
come
at
first
under
pretext
of
looking
for
his
manager
and
ended
by
sitting
down
among
the
gentlemen
although
there
were
many
who
were
no
friends
to
him
and
who
had
chosen
other
matadors
from
among
his
rivals
the
decoration
of
the
house
according
to
don
josé
was
full
of
character
the
lower
part
of
the
walls
were
covered
with
moorish
tiles
and
on
the
immaculately
white
walls
hung
announcements
of
ancient
corridas
stuffed
bulls
heads
of
animals
celebrated
either
for
the
number
of
horses
they
had
killed
or
for
having
wounded
some
celebrated
torero
together
with
procession
capes
and
rapiers
presented
by
espadas
who
had
cut
off
their
pigtails
and
retired
from
the
profession
servants
in
dress
coats
served
the
gentlemen
in
their
country
clothes
or
possibly
in
their
shirt
sleeves
during
the
hot
summer
evenings
during
the
holy
week
and
other
great
holidays
in
seville
when
illustrious
enthusiasts
from
every
part
of
spain
came
and
paid
their
respects
to
the
the
servants
wore
knee
breeches
and
powdered
wigs
donned
the
royal
livery
of
red
and
yellow
and
dressed
thus
like
servants
of
the
royal
household
handed
glasses
of
manzanilla
to
these
wealthy
gentlemen
many
of
whom
had
even
dispensed
with
their
ties
in
the
evenings
when
the
doyen
the
illustrious
marquis
de
moraima
came
in
the
members
in
big
formed
a
circle
round
him
and
the
famous
breeder
in
a
chair
higher
than
the
others
presided
over
the
conversation
for
the
most
part
they
began
by
talking
of
the
weather
most
of
them
were
great
breeders
or
wealthy
landed
proprietors
whose
living
depended
on
the
necessities
of
the
earth
and
the
variations
of
the
weather
the
marquis
explained
the
observations
that
his
wisdom
had
gathered
during
interminable
rides
over
the
lonely
andalusian
plains
so
immense
and
solitary
with
wide
horizons
like
the
sea
on
which
the
bulls
slowly
moving
among
the
waves
of
verdure
seemed
like
basking
sharks
he
could
generally
see
some
piece
of
paper
blown
about
the
street
which
served
as
a
basis
to
his
predictions
the
drought
that
cruel
scourge
of
the
andalusian
plains
gave
them
conversation
for
a
whole
afternoon
and
when
after
weeks
of
anxious
expectation
the
overcast
sky
would
discharge
a
few
big
hot
drops
the
great
country
gentlemen
would
smile
rubbing
their
hands
and
the
marquis
would
say
sententiously
as
he
looked
at
the
great
round
splashes
on
the
pavement
glory
be
to
god
each
drop
of
this
is
worth
a
five
duro
piece
when
they
were
not
anxious
about
the
weather
cattle
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
and
especially
bulls
of
whom
they
spoke
tenderly
almost
as
if
there
were
some
relationship
between
them
the
other
breeders
listened
with
deference
to
the
marquis
opinions
on
account
of
the
advantage
given
him
by
his
large
fortune
the
simple
aficionados
who
never
left
the
town
admired
his
skill
in
producing
fierce
animals
what
this
man
knew
he
himself
as
he
spoke
of
the
extreme
care
required
by
the
bulls
seemed
quite
convinced
of
the
importance
of
his
occupation
out
of
ten
calves
at
least
eight
or
nine
were
fit
only
for
the
butcher
after
they
had
been
tried
to
judge
of
their
fierceness
only
one
or
two
who
had
shown
themselves
brave
and
ready
to
charge
against
the
iron
of
the
garrocha
were
judged
fit
to
pass
as
fighting
animals
thenceforward
these
lived
apart
with
every
sort
of
care
and
what
care
a
breeding
establishment
of
wild
bulls
ought
not
to
be
a
business
said
the
marquis
it
is
an
expensive
luxury
it
is
true
we
are
paid
four
or
five
times
as
much
for
a
fighting
bull
as
for
the
others
but
then
see
what
it
costs
to
rear
they
must
be
watched
constantly
their
food
and
water
considered
moved
from
one
place
to
another
according
to
variations
of
temperature
in
fact
every
bull
costs
more
than
the
maintenance
of
a
family
and
when
at
last
they
were
brought
to
the
highest
pitch
they
had
still
to
be
carefully
watched
up
to
the
last
moment
in
order
that
they
should
not
disgrace
themselves
in
the
circus
but
be
fit
to
do
honour
to
the
badge
of
the
herd
which
hung
round
their
necks
in
certain
plazas
the
marquis
had
even
fought
with
the
managers
and
the
authorities
refusing
to
hand
over
his
animals
because
a
band
was
stationed
just
over
the
bulls
entrance
the
noise
of
the
instruments
bewildered
the
noble
animals
robbing
them
of
their
bravery
and
their
calmness
as
they
entered
the
plaza
they
are
just
like
us
said
he
tenderly
they
only
want
speech
how
can
i
say
like
us
many
are
worth
more
than
any
of
us
and
he
spoke
of
lobito
the
old
head
of
the
herd
swearing
he
would
not
sell
him
if
he
were
offered
all
seville
with
the
giralda
thrown
in
as
soon
as
the
marquis
galloping
across
the
vast
plains
came
in
sight
of
the
herd
to
which
this
treasure
belonged
he
would
instantly
respond
to
the
call
of
and
leaving
his
companions
would
come
to
meet
the
marquis
rubbing
his
muzzle
against
the
rider
boots
and
this
although
he
was
an
immensely
powerful
animal
and
the
terror
of
the
rest
of
the
herd
then
the
breeder
would
dismount
and
search
in
his
saddle
bags
for
a
piece
of
chocolate
to
give
to
lobito
who
would
gratefully
shake
his
head
armed
with
those
immense
horns
then
with
one
arm
round
the
bull
neck
the
marquis
would
calmly
walk
in
among
the
herd
of
bulls
made
restless
and
fierce
by
a
man
presence
there
was
no
danger
lobito
walked
like
a
dog
covering
his
master
with
his
body
looking
all
around
him
and
imposing
respect
on
his
companions
with
his
fiery
eyes
if
any
one
more
venturesome
than
his
comrades
approached
to
sniff
the
intruder
they
met
with
lobito
threatening
horns
if
several
of
them
with
heavy
playfulness
joined
to
bar
his
way
lobito
would
stretch
out
his
armed
head
and
force
them
to
make
way
when
the
marquis
related
the
great
deeds
of
some
of
the
animals
reared
on
his
pastures
his
white
whiskers
and
his
shaven
lips
would
tremble
with
emotion
a
bull
he
is
the
noblest
animal
in
the
world
if
only
men
were
more
like
him
things
would
go
on
better
in
the
world
there
you
have
a
portrait
of
poor
coronel
do
any
of
you
remember
that
jewel
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
to
a
large
photograph
finely
framed
representing
himself
much
younger
in
peasant
dress
surrounded
by
little
girls
in
white
who
seemed
to
be
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
meadow
on
a
black
mound
at
one
end
of
which
appeared
a
pair
of
horns
this
dark
and
shapeless
bank
was
coronel
of
enormous
size
and
very
fierce
to
his
comrades
in
the
herd
this
beast
showed
the
most
affectionate
gentleness
to
his
master
and
his
family
he
was
like
one
of
those
mastiffs
who
are
so
fierce
to
strangers
but
who
let
the
children
of
the
family
pull
their
ears
and
tail
and
receive
all
their
teazing
with
grunts
of
pleasure
the
little
girls
were
the
marquis
daughters
the
beast
would
sniff
at
their
little
white
dresses
while
they
half
frightened
at
first
clung
to
their
father
legs
but
would
suddenly
with
childish
confidence
rub
his
muzzle
lie
down
coronel
and
coronel
would
lie
down
with
his
feet
doubled
beneath
him
while
the
children
sat
on
his
broad
back
heaving
with
his
heavy
breathing
one
day
after
much
hesitation
the
marquis
sold
him
to
the
plaza
in
pampeluna
and
went
himself
to
assist
at
the
corrida
de
moraima
was
deeply
moved
and
his
eyes
were
dim
as
he
recalled
the
occurrence
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
a
bull
like
that
one
he
rushed
gallantly
into
the
arena
though
rather
dazed
at
first
by
the
sudden
light
after
the
darkness
of
his
stall
and
the
roars
of
thousands
of
people
but
directly
a
picador
pricked
him
he
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
plaza
with
his
magnificent
onslaughts
soon
there
were
neither
men
nor
horses
nor
anything
else
left
in
a
moment
all
the
horses
were
down
and
their
riders
tossed
in
the
air
the
peons
ran
and
the
arena
was
in
disarray
as
if
a
branding
had
been
going
on
the
audience
clamoured
for
more
horses
while
coronel
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
waiting
to
turn
and
rend
anyone
who
came
out
against
him
the
slightest
invitation
was
sufficient
to
make
him
attack
no
one
had
ever
seen
anything
like
him
for
nobility
and
power
rushing
in
to
his
charge
with
a
grandeur
and
a
dash
which
drove
the
populace
mad
when
the
death
signal
sounded
he
had
fourteen
wounds
in
him
and
a
complete
set
of
banderillas
yet
he
was
as
fresh
and
as
brave
as
if
he
had
never
left
his
pasture
then
when
the
breeder
reached
this
point
he
always
stopped
to
steady
his
shaking
voice
then
the
marquis
de
moraima
who
was
in
a
box
found
himself
he
knew
not
how
behind
the
barrier
among
the
excited
servants
of
the
plaza
and
close
to
the
matador
who
was
slowly
rolling
up
his
muleta
as
though
he
wished
to
put
off
the
moment
when
he
should
have
to
meet
so
formidable
an
enemy
coronel
shouted
the
marquis
throwing
his
body
half
over
the
barrier
and
striking
the
woodwork
with
his
hands
the
animal
did
not
move
but
he
raised
his
head
as
though
these
shouts
reminded
him
of
the
pastures
he
might
never
see
again
coronel
till
turning
his
head
he
saw
a
man
leaning
over
the
barrier
calling
him
and
rushed
straight
to
attack
him
but
he
stopped
half
way
in
his
wild
rush
then
came
on
slowly
till
he
rubbed
his
horns
against
the
arms
stretched
out
to
him
he
came
with
his
chest
splashed
with
the
streams
of
blood
from
the
darts
fixed
in
his
neck
and
his
skin
torn
by
the
wounds
which
showed
the
blue
muscles
beneath
coronel
my
son
and
the
bull
as
if
he
understood
these
tender
words
raised
his
muzzle
and
rubbed
the
breeder
white
whiskers
why
have
you
brought
me
here
his
fierce
eyes
seemed
to
say
and
the
marquis
no
longer
knowing
what
he
did
kissed
the
beast
nostrils
wet
with
his
furious
snorting
again
and
again
do
not
kill
him
some
kind
soul
shouted
from
the
seats
and
as
though
these
words
reflected
the
thoughts
of
the
whole
audience
an
explosion
of
voices
shook
the
plaza
and
thousands
of
handkerchiefs
waved
like
white
doves
do
not
kill
him
and
at
that
moment
the
crowd
seized
with
a
vague
tenderness
despised
their
own
amusement
abhorred
the
torero
in
his
showy
dress
with
his
useless
heroism
and
admired
the
bravery
of
the
brute
to
whom
they
felt
themselves
inferior
and
recognised
that
among
those
thousands
of
reasoning
beings
nobility
and
affection
were
alone
represented
by
this
poor
animal
i
took
him
away
said
the
marquis
almost
sobbing
i
returned
the
manager
his
two
thousand
pesetas
i
would
have
given
him
my
whole
fortune
after
a
month
on
the
pasture
there
was
not
the
vestige
of
a
scar
on
his
neck
i
should
have
wished
him
to
die
of
old
age
but
it
is
not
always
the
good
who
prosper
in
this
world
a
sulky
bull
who
would
not
have
dared
to
look
him
in
the
face
killed
him
treacherously
with
a
blow
of
his
horn
the
marquis
and
his
soon
forgot
their
tender
sympathy
for
the
animals
in
the
pride
they
felt
at
their
fierceness
you
should
have
seen
the
contempt
with
which
they
spoke
of
the
enemies
of
and
of
those
who
clamoured
against
this
art
in
the
name
of
the
protection
of
animals
follies
of
foreigners
ignorant
errors
which
confound
a
ox
with
a
fighting
bull
the
spanish
bull
is
a
wild
animal
the
bravest
wild
beast
in
the
world
and
he
recalled
several
fights
between
bulls
and
felines
which
had
always
ended
triumphantly
for
the
national
beast
the
marquis
laughed
as
he
remembered
another
of
his
animals
a
fight
was
arranged
in
a
certain
plaza
between
a
bull
and
a
lion
and
a
tiger
belonging
to
a
celebrated
tamer
the
breeder
sent
barrabas
a
vicious
animal
which
had
to
be
kept
apart
at
the
farm
because
he
had
fought
with
and
killed
several
of
his
companions
i
saw
this
myself
said
the
marquis
there
was
a
huge
iron
cage
in
the
middle
of
the
circus
and
inside
it
was
barrabas
they
loosed
the
lion
first
and
this
accursed
feline
taking
advantage
of
a
bull
being
unsuspicious
sprung
upon
his
hind
quarters
and
began
to
tear
him
with
teeth
and
claws
barrabas
bounded
furiously
in
order
to
dislodge
him
and
get
him
within
reach
of
the
horns
which
are
his
defence
at
last
he
succeeded
in
throwing
the
lion
in
front
of
him
and
then
caballeros
it
was
just
like
a
game
of
ball
he
tossed
him
from
one
horn
to
another
shaking
him
like
a
marionette
till
at
last
as
if
he
despised
him
he
threw
him
on
one
side
and
there
lay
the
king
of
animals
rolled
into
a
ball
and
lying
like
a
cat
who
has
just
been
beaten
the
second
affair
was
much
shorter
as
soon
as
the
tiger
appeared
barrabas
caught
him
tossed
him
in
the
air
and
after
shaking
him
well
threw
him
into
the
corner
like
the
other
then
barrabas
being
an
beast
trotted
up
and
down
with
every
indecent
display
of
triumph
over
his
fallen
foes
these
anecdotes
always
drew
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
the
spanish
bull
the
finest
wild
animal
it
seemed
as
if
the
arrogant
bravery
of
the
national
animal
established
the
superiority
of
the
country
and
the
race
over
all
others
when
gallardo
began
to
frequent
the
club
a
fresh
topic
of
conversation
had
arisen
to
interrupt
the
endless
talk
of
bulls
and
field
work
the
like
every
one
else
in
seville
were
talking
of
the
exploits
of
plumitas
a
brigand
celebrated
for
his
audacity
to
whom
the
useless
efforts
of
his
pursuers
daily
gave
fresh
fame
the
papers
spoke
of
his
kindly
disposition
as
if
he
were
a
national
personage
the
government
who
were
questioned
in
the
cortes
promised
a
speedy
capture
which
was
never
realized
the
civil
guard
were
concentrated
and
a
perfect
army
was
mobilized
to
follow
and
catch
him
while
plumitas
always
alone
with
no
other
help
but
his
carbine
and
his
horse
slipped
through
those
who
were
following
him
like
a
ghost
he
would
turn
on
them
when
they
were
few
in
numbers
and
stretch
many
lifeless
but
he
was
reverenced
and
helped
by
all
the
poor
peasantry
wretched
slaves
of
the
enormous
landed
interest
who
looked
upon
the
bandit
as
the
avenger
of
the
starving
a
just
but
cruel
justiciary
after
the
fashion
of
the
ancient
knights
errant
he
exacted
money
from
the
rich
and
then
with
the
manner
of
an
actor
before
an
immense
audience
he
would
assist
some
poor
old
woman
or
some
labourer
with
a
large
family
these
generosities
were
greatly
exaggerated
by
the
gossip
of
the
rural
population
who
always
had
the
name
of
plumitas
on
their
lips
but
who
became
both
blind
and
dumb
when
any
enquiries
were
made
by
the
government
soldiers
he
went
from
one
province
to
another
like
one
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
country
and
the
landed
proprietors
of
seville
and
cordova
contributed
largely
to
his
support
whole
weeks
passed
and
nothing
would
be
heard
of
him
then
suddenly
he
would
appear
in
some
farm
or
village
utterly
regardless
of
danger
they
had
direct
news
of
him
in
the
precisely
as
if
he
had
been
a
matador
plumitas
was
at
my
farm
the
day
before
yesterday
a
rich
farmer
would
say
the
overseer
gave
him
thirty
duros
and
he
went
away
after
breakfasting
they
paid
this
contribution
contentedly
and
gave
no
information
except
to
friends
giving
information
meant
making
declarations
and
every
sort
of
annoyance
and
for
what
the
civil
guard
sought
him
without
success
and
had
he
become
incensed
against
the
informers
their
goods
and
property
would
have
been
at
his
mercy
without
any
protection
whatever
from
his
vengeance
the
marquis
spoke
of
plumitas
and
his
exploits
without
being
in
the
least
scandalized
by
them
and
treated
them
as
though
they
were
a
natural
and
inevitable
calamity
they
are
poor
fellows
who
have
had
some
misfortune
and
have
taken
to
the
road
my
father
who
rests
in
peace
knew
the
famous
josé
maria
and
had
twice
breakfasted
with
him
i
have
run
against
several
of
lesser
fame
who
went
about
the
neighbourhood
doing
evil
deeds
they
are
just
the
same
as
bulls
noble
and
simple
creatures
they
only
attack
when
goaded
and
their
evil
deeds
increase
with
punishment
he
had
given
orders
to
all
the
overseers
at
his
farms
and
in
all
his
shepherds
hovels
to
give
plumitas
whatever
he
asked
for
consequently
as
the
overseers
and
cowherds
related
the
bandit
with
the
respect
of
a
country
peasant
for
a
kind
and
generous
master
spoke
of
him
with
the
greatest
gratitude
offering
to
kill
anyone
who
offended
the
zeno
marque
in
the
very
slightest
degree
poor
fellow
for
the
wretched
little
sums
which
he
demanded
when
he
made
his
appearance
wearied
and
starving
it
was
not
worth
while
drawing
down
on
oneself
his
anger
and
revenge
the
breeder
who
was
constantly
galloping
alone
over
the
plains
where
his
bulls
grazed
suspected
that
he
had
several
times
come
across
plumitas
he
was
probably
one
of
those
horsemen
whom
he
met
in
the
solitary
plains
without
so
much
as
a
village
on
the
horizon
who
would
raise
his
hand
to
his
greasy
sombrero
and
say
with
respectful
civility
go
with
god
zeno
marque
the
lord
of
moraima
when
he
spoke
of
plumitas
looked
often
at
gallardo
who
declaimed
with
the
vehemence
of
a
novice
against
the
authorities
for
being
unable
to
protect
property
some
fine
day
he
will
turn
up
at
la
rincona
my
lad
said
the
marquis
with
his
grave
andalusian
drawl
curse
him
but
that
would
not
please
me
zeno
marque
god
alive
is
it
for
this
i
pay
such
heavy
taxes
no
indeed
it
would
not
please
him
to
run
against
the
bandit
during
his
excursions
at
la
rinconada
he
was
a
brave
man
killing
bulls
and
in
a
plaza
regardless
of
his
own
life
but
this
profession
of
killing
men
inspired
him
with
all
the
uneasiness
of
the
unknown
his
family
were
at
the
farm
señora
angustias
enjoyed
a
country
life
after
the
miseries
of
an
existence
spent
in
town
hovels
carmen
also
enjoyed
it
and
the
saddler
children
required
a
change
so
gallardo
had
sent
his
family
to
la
rincona
promising
soon
to
join
them
he
however
postponed
the
journey
by
every
sort
of
pretext
living
a
bachelor
life
with
no
other
companion
than
garabato
which
left
him
complete
liberty
as
to
his
relations
with
doña
sol
he
thought
this
the
happiest
time
of
his
life
and
he
often
quite
forgot
la
rinconada
and
its
inhabitants
he
and
doña
sol
rode
together
mounted
on
spirited
horses
dressed
much
the
same
as
on
the
day
when
they
first
met
generally
alone
but
sometimes
with
don
josé
whose
presence
was
a
sop
to
scandalized
feelings
they
would
go
to
see
bulls
in
the
pastures
round
seville
or
to
try
calves
at
the
marquis
dairies
and
doña
sol
always
eager
for
danger
was
delighted
when
as
he
felt
the
prick
of
the
garrocha
a
young
bull
would
turn
and
attack
her
and
gallardo
had
to
come
to
her
assistance
at
other
times
they
would
go
to
the
station
of
empalme
if
a
boxing
of
bulls
was
announced
for
the
different
plazas
which
were
giving
special
corridas
at
the
end
of
the
winter
doña
sol
examined
this
place
which
was
the
most
important
centre
of
exportation
of
the
taurine
industry
with
great
interest
there
were
large
enclosures
alongside
the
railway
siding
and
dozens
of
huge
boxes
on
wheels
with
movable
doors
the
bulls
who
were
to
be
entrained
arrived
galloping
along
a
dusty
road
edged
with
barbed
wire
many
came
from
distant
provinces
but
on
getting
close
to
empalme
they
were
sent
on
with
a
rush
in
order
to
get
them
into
the
enclosures
with
greater
ease
in
front
galloped
the
overseers
and
shepherds
with
their
lances
on
their
shoulders
and
behind
them
the
prudent
cabestros
covering
the
men
with
their
huge
horns
after
these
came
the
fighting
bulls
well
rounded
up
by
tame
bulls
who
prevented
them
straying
from
the
road
and
followed
by
strong
cowherds
ready
to
sling
a
stone
at
any
wandering
pair
of
horns
arrived
at
the
enclosures
the
foremost
riders
drew
to
either
side
leaving
the
gateway
open
and
the
whole
herd
an
avalanche
of
dust
pawings
snortings
and
bells
rushed
in
like
an
overwhelming
torrent
and
the
gate
was
immediately
closed
after
the
last
animal
they
tore
through
the
first
enclosure
without
noticing
that
they
were
trapped
the
cabestros
taught
by
experience
and
obedient
to
the
shepherds
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
into
the
second
where
the
herd
only
stopped
on
finding
a
blank
wall
before
them
now
the
boxing
began
one
by
one
they
were
driven
by
shouts
waving
cloths
and
blows
from
garrochas
into
a
narrow
lane
at
the
end
of
which
stood
the
travelling
box
with
both
its
side
doors
lowered
it
looked
like
a
small
tunnel
through
which
the
brutes
could
see
a
field
beyond
with
animals
quietly
grazing
the
suspicious
bulls
guessed
some
danger
in
this
small
tunnel
and
had
to
be
driven
on
by
clappings
and
whistlings
and
pricks
finally
they
would
make
a
dash
for
the
quiet
pasture
beyond
making
the
sloping
platform
leading
to
the
box
shake
as
they
rushed
up
it
but
as
soon
as
they
had
mounted
this
the
door
in
front
of
them
was
suddenly
closed
and
then
equally
quickly
the
one
behind
and
the
bull
was
caught
in
a
cage
where
he
could
only
just
stand
up
or
lie
down
comfortably
the
box
was
then
wheeled
into
the
railway
and
another
one
took
its
place
till
all
the
herd
were
successfully
entrained
when
the
first
intoxication
of
gallardo
good
fortune
had
passed
off
he
looked
at
doña
sol
with
the
utmost
astonishment
wondering
in
the
hours
of
their
greatest
intimacy
if
all
great
ladies
were
like
this
one
the
caprices
and
fickleness
of
her
character
bewildered
him
he
had
never
dared
to
address
her
as
tu
indeed
she
had
never
invited
him
to
such
a
familiarity
and
on
the
one
occasion
when
with
slow
and
hesitating
tongue
he
had
attempted
it
he
had
seen
in
her
golden
eyes
such
a
gleam
of
anger
and
surprise
that
he
had
drawn
back
ashamed
and
had
returned
to
the
former
mode
of
speech
she
on
the
other
hand
spoke
to
him
as
tu
but
only
in
the
hours
of
privacy
if
she
had
to
write
to
him
asking
him
not
to
come
or
saying
she
was
going
out
with
her
relations
she
always
used
the
ceremonious
uste
and
there
were
no
expressions
of
affection
only
the
cold
courtesies
that
might
be
written
to
a
friend
of
an
inferior
class
oh
that
gachi
murmured
gallardo
disheartened
it
seems
as
if
she
had
always
lived
with
rascals
who
showed
her
letters
to
every
one
one
would
think
she
can
not
believe
me
to
be
a
gentleman
because
i
am
a
matador
some
of
her
eccentricities
left
the
torero
frowning
and
sad
sometimes
on
going
to
the
house
one
of
the
magnificent
servants
would
coldly
bar
his
way
the
señora
was
not
at
home
or
the
señora
had
gone
out
and
he
knew
that
it
was
a
lie
feeling
the
presence
of
doña
sol
a
short
distance
from
him
the
other
side
of
the
curtained
doors
the
fuel
is
spent
said
the
espada
to
himself
i
will
not
return
that
gachi
shall
not
laugh
at
me
but
when
he
did
return
she
received
him
with
open
arms
clasping
him
close
in
her
firm
white
hands
with
her
eyes
wide
open
and
vague
and
a
strange
light
in
them
which
seemed
to
speak
of
mental
derangement
why
do
you
perfume
yourself
she
said
as
if
she
perceived
the
most
unpleasant
smells
it
is
unworthy
of
you
i
should
like
you
to
smell
of
bulls
of
horses
those
are
fine
scents
do
you
love
them
say
yes
juanin
my
animal
one
night
in
the
soft
twilight
of
doña
sol
bedroom
gallardo
felt
something
very
like
fear
hearing
her
speak
and
watching
her
eyes
i
should
like
to
run
on
all
fours
i
should
like
to
be
a
bull
and
that
you
should
stand
before
me
rapier
in
hand
fine
gorings
i
would
give
you
here
and
here
and
with
her
clenched
fist
to
which
her
excitement
gave
fresh
strength
she
planted
several
blows
on
the
matador
chest
only
covered
by
his
thin
silk
vest
gallardo
drew
back
not
wishing
to
admit
that
a
woman
could
possibly
hurt
him
no
not
a
bull
i
should
like
to
be
a
dog
a
shepherd
dog
one
of
those
with
long
fangs
to
come
out
and
bark
at
you
do
you
see
that
fine
fellow
who
kills
bulls
and
who
the
public
say
is
so
brave
well
i
shall
bite
him
i
shall
bite
him
like
this
aaaam
and
with
hysterical
delight
she
fixed
her
teeth
in
the
matador
arm
punishing
his
swelling
biceps
exasperated
by
the
pain
the
matador
swore
a
big
oath
shaking
the
beautiful
woman
from
him
whose
golden
hair
stood
up
round
her
head
like
that
of
a
drunken
bacchante
doña
sol
seemed
suddenly
to
awake
poor
fellow
i
have
hurt
you
and
it
was
i
i
who
am
sometimes
mad
let
me
kiss
the
bite
to
cure
it
let
me
kiss
all
your
glorious
scars
my
poor
little
brute
it
made
you
cry
out
and
the
beautiful
fury
suddenly
became
tender
and
gentle
purring
round
the
torero
like
a
kitten
one
evening
finding
her
inclined
to
be
confidential
and
feeling
some
curiosity
as
to
her
past
he
questioned
her
as
to
the
kings
and
other
great
personages
whom
report
said
had
crossed
her
path
with
a
cold
stare
in
her
eyes
she
replied
to
his
curiosity
what
does
it
matter
to
you
are
you
by
any
chance
jealous
and
if
it
were
true
what
then
she
remained
silent
a
long
while
with
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
the
look
of
madness
which
was
always
accompanied
by
extravagant
thoughts
you
must
have
struck
many
women
she
said
looking
at
him
curiously
do
not
deny
it
it
interests
me
greatly
no
not
your
wife
i
know
she
is
very
good
but
all
those
that
toreros
mix
with
women
who
love
better
when
they
are
beaten
no
say
truly
have
you
never
struck
any
one
gallardo
protested
with
the
dignity
of
a
brave
man
incapable
of
hurting
those
weaker
than
himself
doña
sol
showed
a
certain
disbelief
in
his
asseverations
one
day
you
will
have
to
beat
me
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
is
she
said
resolutely
but
her
expression
darkened
she
frowned
and
a
steely
gleam
lit
up
the
golden
light
in
her
eyes
no
my
brute
pay
no
attention
to
me
and
do
not
attempt
it
you
would
be
the
loser
the
advice
was
just
and
gallardo
had
cause
to
remember
it
one
day
in
a
moment
of
intimacy
a
somewhat
rough
caress
from
his
fighting
hand
was
enough
to
rouse
this
woman
fury
who
was
attracted
by
the
man
and
yet
hated
him
at
the
same
time
take
that
and
with
a
fist
as
hard
as
a
club
she
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
jaw
from
below
upwards
with
a
precision
which
seemed
inspired
by
a
knowledge
of
the
rules
of
boxing
gallardo
remained
bewildered
by
pain
and
shame
while
the
lady
as
if
she
suddenly
realized
her
unprovoked
aggression
endeavoured
to
justify
herself
with
cold
hostility
it
is
to
teach
you
better
i
know
what
you
toreros
are
if
i
were
to
let
myself
be
trampled
on
once
for
ever
after
you
would
shake
me
like
a
gipsy
of
triana
i
am
glad
i
did
it
you
must
keep
your
distance
one
evening
in
early
spring
they
were
returning
from
a
trial
of
calves
at
one
of
the
farms
belonging
to
the
marquis
who
with
some
other
friends
was
riding
home
along
the
road
doña
sol
followed
by
the
espada
turned
her
horse
into
the
fields
delighting
in
the
soft
sward
under
their
hoofs
which
at
this
season
was
carpeted
with
spring
flowers
the
setting
sun
dyed
everything
with
crimson
lengthening
indefinitely
the
shadows
of
the
riders
with
their
long
lances
over
their
shoulders
and
the
broad
river
half
hidden
among
the
vegetation
rolled
along
one
side
of
the
meadows
doña
sol
looked
at
gallardo
with
imperious
eyes
put
your
arm
round
my
waist
the
espada
obeyed
and
so
they
rode
on
their
horses
close
together
the
woman
watching
their
shadows
thrown
as
one
by
the
setting
sun
on
the
grass
it
seems
as
though
we
were
living
in
another
world
she
murmured
a
legendary
world
something
like
one
sees
on
the
tapestries
the
loving
knight
and
the
amazon
travelling
together
their
lances
on
their
shoulders
in
search
of
adventures
and
dangers
but
you
do
not
understand
all
this
dunce
of
my
heart
answer
truly
you
do
not
understand
me
the
torero
smiled
showing
his
beautiful
strong
teeth
of
luminous
whiteness
she
as
if
attracted
by
his
rough
ignorance
drew
closer
to
him
laying
her
head
on
his
shoulder
shivering
as
she
felt
his
breath
on
the
back
of
her
neck
they
rode
on
in
silence
doña
sol
seemed
to
have
fallen
asleep
on
the
torero
shoulder
suddenly
her
eyes
opened
flashing
with
that
strange
light
which
was
always
the
precursor
of
the
most
extraordinary
questions
say
have
you
never
killed
a
man
gallardo
started
and
in
his
astonishment
disengaged
himself
from
doña
sol
who
he
never
he
had
been
a
good
fellow
who
had
followed
his
profession
without
doing
harm
to
anyone
he
had
scarcely
even
fought
with
his
companions
at
the
capeas
when
they
held
on
to
the
peace
because
they
were
the
strongest
he
had
exchanged
a
few
blows
with
others
of
his
profession
or
fought
a
round
in
a
café
but
the
life
of
a
man
inspired
him
with
deep
respect
bulls
were
another
affair
so
that
you
have
never
felt
the
slightest
wish
to
kill
a
man
and
i
who
thought
that
toreros
the
sun
had
set
and
the
landscape
which
before
had
seemed
so
brilliant
now
looked
dull
and
grey
even
the
river
had
disappeared
and
doña
sol
spurred
on
her
horse
without
saying
another
word
or
even
appearing
to
notice
if
the
espada
were
following
her
before
the
holy
week
holidays
gallardo
family
returned
to
seville
the
espada
was
to
fight
at
the
easter
corrida
it
was
the
first
time
he
would
kill
in
doña
sol
presence
since
he
had
come
to
know
her
and
it
made
him
doubtful
of
his
powers
besides
he
never
could
fight
in
seville
without
a
certain
disquietude
he
could
accept
an
unlucky
mischance
in
any
other
plaza
in
spain
thinking
he
would
probably
not
return
there
for
some
time
but
in
his
own
native
town
where
his
greatest
enemies
lived
we
must
see
you
distinguish
yourself
said
don
josé
think
of
those
who
will
be
watching
you
i
expect
you
to
remain
the
first
man
in
the
world
on
the
saturday
of
gloria
during
the
small
hours
of
the
night
the
enclosing
of
the
cattle
for
the
following
day
corrida
was
to
take
place
and
doña
sol
wished
to
assist
as
picqeur
at
the
operation
which
presented
the
further
delight
of
taking
place
in
the
dark
the
bulls
had
to
be
brought
from
the
pastures
of
tablada
to
the
enclosures
at
the
plaza
in
spite
of
gallardo
wish
to
accompany
doña
sol
he
was
unable
to
do
so
his
manager
opposed
it
alleging
the
necessity
of
his
keeping
himself
fresh
and
vigorous
for
the
following
afternoon
at
midnight
the
road
leading
from
the
pastures
to
the
plaza
was
as
lively
as
a
fair
in
the
country
villas
the
windows
were
lighted
up
and
shadows
passed
before
them
dancing
to
the
sound
of
pianos
in
the
little
inns
whose
open
doors
threw
broad
streaks
of
light
across
the
road
the
tinkling
of
guitars
the
clinking
of
glasses
and
shouts
and
laughter
let
it
be
known
that
wine
was
circulating
freely
about
one
in
the
morning
a
rider
passed
along
the
road
at
a
slow
trot
he
was
el
aviso
a
rough
shepherd
who
stopped
before
the
taverns
and
gay
country
houses
warning
them
that
the
herd
would
pass
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
that
lights
might
be
extinguished
and
everything
be
quiet
this
order
given
in
the
name
of
the
national
sport
was
obeyed
with
far
more
alacrity
than
any
one
given
by
the
authorities
the
houses
remained
in
darkness
the
whiteness
of
their
walls
confounded
with
the
shadowy
mass
of
trees
the
invisible
people
assembled
behind
the
barred
and
spiked
window
gratings
were
silent
in
the
expectation
of
something
extraordinary
in
the
walks
alongside
the
river
the
gas
lamps
were
extinguished
one
by
one
as
the
shepherd
advanced
shouting
the
coming
of
the
herd
everything
was
absolutely
silent
above
the
trees
the
stars
were
shining
and
below
on
the
ground
only
the
slightest
rustle
the
faintest
murmur
betrayed
in
the
darkness
the
presence
of
crowds
of
people
the
wait
seemed
very
long
till
at
last
in
the
far
distance
the
faint
sound
of
deep
bells
was
heard
they
are
coming
they
will
soon
be
here
the
clangour
of
the
bells
became
louder
and
at
last
deafening
accompanied
by
a
confused
galloping
which
shook
the
ground
first
of
all
passed
several
riders
with
lances
over
their
shoulders
who
appeared
gigantic
in
the
darkness
their
horses
at
full
stretch
these
were
the
shepherds
then
came
a
group
of
amateur
garrochists
among
whom
galloped
doña
sol
delighted
at
this
mad
ride
through
the
darkness
in
which
the
single
false
step
of
a
horse
or
a
fall
meant
certain
death
from
trampling
beneath
the
hard
hoofs
of
the
fierce
herd
rushing
blindly
on
behind
in
their
furious
career
the
herd
bells
rang
wildly
the
open
mouths
of
the
spectators
hidden
by
the
darkness
swallowed
large
gulps
of
dust
and
the
furious
mob
of
cattle
rushed
by
like
a
nightmare
of
shapeless
monsters
of
the
night
heavy
but
at
the
same
time
agile
giving
horrible
snorts
goring
at
the
shadows
with
their
horns
terrified
and
irritated
by
the
shouts
of
the
young
shepherds
following
on
foot
and
by
the
galloping
of
the
riders
closing
the
cavalcade
who
drove
them
on
with
their
pikes
the
transit
of
this
ponderous
and
noisy
troupe
only
lasted
an
instant
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
seen
and
the
populace
satisfied
by
this
fleeting
spectacle
came
out
of
their
hiding
places
and
many
of
the
enthusiasts
ran
after
the
herd
hoping
to
see
their
entrance
into
the
enclosures
when
they
arrived
near
the
plaza
the
foremost
riders
drew
on
one
side
making
way
for
the
animals
who
from
the
impetus
of
their
rush
and
their
habit
of
following
the
cabestros
engaged
themselves
in
la
manga
a
narrow
lane
formed
of
palisades
leading
to
the
plaza
the
amateur
garrochists
congratulated
themselves
on
the
good
management
of
the
enclosing
the
herd
had
been
well
rounded
up
without
a
single
bull
being
able
to
stray
or
giving
work
to
picqeurs
or
peons
they
were
all
animals
the
best
from
the
marquis
breeding
farms
and
a
good
day
might
confidently
be
expected
on
the
morrow
in
this
hope
the
riders
and
peons
soon
dispersed
an
hour
afterwards
the
surroundings
of
the
plaza
were
completely
deserted
and
the
fierce
brutes
safe
in
their
enclosures
lay
down
to
enjoy
their
last
sleep
on
the
following
morning
juan
gallardo
rose
early
he
had
slept
badly
with
an
anxiety
that
peopled
his
dreams
with
nightmares
why
did
they
make
him
fight
in
seville
in
other
towns
he
forgot
his
family
for
the
moment
he
lived
as
a
bachelor
in
a
room
in
an
hotel
completely
strange
to
him
that
contained
nothing
dear
to
him
and
that
reminded
him
of
nothing
but
here
to
put
on
his
fighting
costume
in
his
own
bedroom
where
everything
about
on
the
table
reminded
him
of
carmen
to
go
out
and
face
the
danger
from
the
house
that
he
himself
had
built
and
which
contained
all
that
was
dearest
to
him
in
life
disconcerted
him
and
awoke
in
him
as
much
trepidation
as
if
he
were
going
to
kill
his
first
bull
besides
he
was
afraid
of
his
with
whom
he
had
to
live
and
whose
opinion
was
more
important
to
him
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
spain
ay
and
that
terrible
moment
of
leaving
after
garabato
had
put
on
his
gala
dress
and
he
descended
into
the
silent
courtyard
the
little
children
came
to
look
at
him
frightened
by
his
brilliant
clothes
touching
him
admiringly
but
not
daring
to
speak
his
mustachioed
sister
kissed
him
with
a
look
of
terror
as
if
he
were
being
taken
off
to
die
his
mother
hid
herself
in
the
darkest
room
no
she
did
not
wish
to
see
him
she
felt
carmen
deathly
pale
was
a
little
braver
biting
her
lips
white
with
emotion
blinking
her
eyes
nervously
to
keep
back
the
tears
but
when
she
saw
him
in
the
courtyard
she
immediately
raised
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
her
whole
frame
shaking
with
the
sobs
she
tried
to
suppress
and
her
and
other
women
had
to
support
her
lest
she
should
fall
to
the
ground
it
was
enough
to
make
a
coward
of
even
the
real
roger
de
flor
curse
it
all
come
along
man
said
gallardo
i
would
not
fight
in
seville
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
were
it
not
to
give
pleasure
to
my
and
to
prevent
evil
speakers
from
saying
i
am
afraid
of
the
public
in
my
own
town
after
rising
the
espada
had
wandered
about
the
house
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
stretching
himself
to
see
if
his
muscular
arms
still
retained
their
suppleness
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
drank
a
glass
of
cazalla
where
his
mother
active
in
spite
of
years
and
stoutness
was
superintending
the
servants
and
looking
after
the
proper
ordering
of
the
house
gallardo
went
out
into
the
patio
so
fresh
and
bright
the
birds
were
singing
gaily
in
their
gilded
cages
a
flood
of
sunshine
swept
over
the
marble
pavement
and
on
to
the
fountain
surrounded
by
plants
where
the
gold
fish
swam
in
the
basin
the
espada
saw
kneeling
on
the
ground
a
woman
figure
in
black
with
a
pail
by
her
side
washing
the
marble
floor
she
raised
her
head
señor
juan
she
said
with
the
affectionate
familiarity
that
all
popular
heroes
inspire
and
she
fixed
on
him
admiringly
the
glance
of
her
solitary
eye
the
other
was
lost
in
a
multiplicity
of
deep
wrinkles
which
seemed
to
meet
in
the
hollow
black
socket
the
señor
juan
made
no
reply
but
turned
away
nervously
into
the
kitchen
calling
out
to
his
mother
little
mother
who
is
that
woman
who
is
washing
the
patio
who
should
she
be
son
a
poor
woman
with
a
large
family
our
own
charwoman
is
ill
so
i
called
her
in
the
torero
was
uneasy
and
his
look
showed
both
anxiety
and
fear
curse
it
bulls
in
seville
and
the
first
person
he
met
face
to
face
was
a
woman
certainly
those
things
did
not
happen
to
any
one
else
nothing
could
be
of
worse
augury
did
they
want
his
death
the
poor
woman
shocked
by
his
dismal
prognostications
and
by
his
vehement
anger
tried
to
exculpate
herself
how
could
she
think
of
that
the
poor
woman
wanted
to
earn
a
peseta
for
her
children
he
must
pick
up
a
good
heart
and
thank
god
who
had
so
often
remembered
them
and
delivered
them
from
similar
misery
gallardo
was
softened
by
her
allusion
to
their
former
poverty
which
always
made
him
very
tolerant
to
the
good
woman
all
right
let
the
one
remain
and
let
what
god
willed
happen
and
crossing
the
patio
with
his
back
turned
to
her
so
as
not
to
see
that
terrible
eye
the
matador
took
refuge
in
his
office
close
to
the
vestibule
the
white
walls
panelled
with
moorish
tiles
to
the
height
of
a
man
were
hung
with
announcements
of
corridas
printed
on
silks
of
different
colours
and
diplomas
of
charitable
societies
with
pompous
titles
recording
corridas
in
which
gallardo
had
fought
gratuitously
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
innumerable
portraits
of
himself
on
foot
seated
spreading
his
cape
squaring
himself
to
kill
testified
to
the
care
with
which
the
papers
reproduced
the
gestures
and
divers
positions
of
the
great
man
above
the
doorway
was
a
portrait
of
carmen
in
a
white
mantilla
which
made
her
eyes
appear
darker
than
ever
with
a
bunch
of
carnations
fastened
in
her
black
hair
on
the
opposite
wall
above
the
by
the
writing
bureau
was
the
enormous
head
of
a
black
bull
with
glassy
eyes
highly
varnished
nostrils
a
spot
of
white
hair
on
the
forehead
and
enormous
horns
tapering
to
the
finest
point
white
as
ivory
at
the
base
and
gradually
darkening
to
inky
blackness
at
the
tips
potaje
the
picador
always
broke
out
into
poetic
rhapsodies
as
he
looked
at
those
enormous
horns
saying
that
a
blackbird
might
sing
on
the
point
of
one
horn
without
being
heard
from
the
point
of
the
other
gallardo
sat
down
by
the
beautiful
table
covered
with
bronzes
where
nothing
seemed
out
of
place
save
the
thick
coating
of
several
dust
on
the
writing
bureau
which
was
of
immense
size
the
ink
bottles
ornamented
by
two
metal
horses
were
clean
and
empty
the
handsome
pen
tray
supported
by
dogs
heads
was
also
empty
the
great
man
had
no
occasion
to
write
for
don
josé
his
manager
brought
him
all
contracts
and
other
professional
papers
to
the
club
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
where
on
a
small
table
the
espada
slowly
and
laboriously
affixed
his
signature
on
one
side
of
the
room
stood
the
library
a
handsome
bookcase
of
carved
oak
through
the
glass
doors
of
which
could
be
seen
imposing
rows
of
volumes
remarkable
for
their
size
and
the
brilliance
of
their
bindings
when
don
josé
began
to
call
gallardo
the
torero
of
the
aristocracy
the
latter
felt
he
must
live
up
to
this
distinction
educating
himself
so
that
his
rich
friends
should
not
laugh
at
his
ignorance
as
had
happened
to
sundry
of
his
comrades
so
one
day
he
entered
a
book
shop
with
a
determined
air
send
me
three
thousand
pesetas
worth
of
books
when
the
librarian
looked
slightly
bewildered
as
if
he
did
not
understand
the
torero
proceeded
energetically
books
do
you
understand
me
the
biggest
books
and
if
you
have
no
objection
i
should
like
them
gilt
gallardo
was
quite
pleased
with
the
look
of
his
library
when
anything
was
spoken
of
at
the
club
which
he
did
not
understand
he
smiled
knowingly
and
said
to
himself
that
must
be
in
one
of
the
books
i
have
in
the
study
one
rainy
afternoon
when
he
felt
rather
poorly
after
wandering
listlessly
about
the
house
not
knowing
what
to
do
he
had
opened
the
bookcase
and
taken
out
a
book
the
largest
of
all
but
after
a
few
lines
he
gave
up
the
reading
and
turned
over
the
pages
looking
at
the
prints
like
a
child
who
wants
to
amuse
itself
lions
elephants
wild
horses
with
flowing
manes
and
fiery
eyes
donkeys
striped
in
colours
regular
as
if
done
by
rule
the
torero
turned
them
all
over
carelessly
till
his
eyes
fell
on
the
painted
rings
of
a
snake
ugh
the
beast
the
nasty
beast
and
he
closed
convulsively
the
two
middle
fingers
of
his
hand
throwing
out
the
index
and
little
finger
like
horns
to
exorcise
the
evil
eye
he
went
on
a
little
but
all
the
prints
represented
horrible
reptiles
till
at
last
with
shaking
hands
he
shut
the
book
and
returned
it
to
the
bookcase
murmuring
lizard
lizard
to
dispel
the
impression
of
this
evil
encounter
and
the
key
of
the
bookcase
remained
thenceforward
in
a
drawer
of
the
bureau
covered
with
old
papers
that
morning
the
time
he
spent
in
his
study
only
served
to
increase
his
anxieties
and
trepidation
scarcely
knowing
why
he
had
been
considering
the
bull
head
and
the
most
painful
episode
of
his
professional
life
had
vividly
recurred
to
his
memory
what
a
sweating
that
brute
had
given
him
in
the
circus
at
zaragoza
the
bull
was
as
intelligent
as
a
man
motionless
and
with
eyes
of
diabolical
maliciousness
he
waited
for
the
matador
to
approach
him
when
not
deceived
by
the
red
cloth
he
struck
underneath
it
directly
at
the
body
the
rapiers
were
sent
flying
through
the
air
by
his
charges
without
ever
succeeding
in
wounding
him
the
populace
became
impatient
whistling
at
and
insulting
the
torero
the
latter
came
behind
the
bull
following
his
every
movement
from
one
side
of
the
plaza
to
the
other
knowing
full
well
that
if
he
stood
straight
and
square
before
the
animal
to
kill
that
he
himself
would
be
the
one
to
die
until
at
last
perspiring
and
fatigued
he
took
advantage
of
an
opportunity
to
finish
him
by
a
treacherous
side
blow
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
mob
who
pelted
him
with
bottles
and
oranges
a
remembrance
which
made
him
hot
with
shame
and
which
returning
unluckily
at
this
time
seemed
to
him
of
quite
as
evil
augury
as
meeting
the
woman
and
seeing
the
snake
he
breakfasted
alone
and
ate
little
as
was
his
habit
on
the
days
of
a
corrida
and
by
the
time
he
went
up
to
dress
the
women
had
disappeared
ay
how
they
hated
that
brilliant
costume
kept
so
carefully
wrapped
up
in
linen
splendid
tools
which
had
built
up
the
luxury
of
the
family
the
farewells
were
as
usual
disconcerting
and
troubling
for
gallardo
the
flight
of
the
women
not
to
see
him
come
down
carmen
attempts
at
fortitude
accompanying
him
as
far
as
the
door
the
wondering
curiosity
of
the
little
nephews
everything
irritated
the
torero
grown
arrogant
and
hectoring
as
he
saw
the
danger
approaching
one
would
think
i
was
being
taken
to
the
gibbet
for
the
present
calm
yourselves
nothing
will
happen
and
he
got
into
the
carriage
making
way
for
himself
through
the
friends
and
neighbours
assembled
in
front
of
the
house
to
wish
señor
juan
good
luck
the
afternoons
when
the
espada
fought
in
seville
were
the
most
agonizing
for
the
family
when
he
fought
away
from
home
they
were
obliged
to
resign
themselves
patiently
to
wait
for
the
evening
telegram
here
the
danger
being
close
at
hand
a
desperate
anxiety
for
news
awoke
and
the
necessity
of
hearing
every
few
minutes
how
the
corrida
was
going
on
the
saddler
dressed
as
a
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
light
flannel
and
a
silky
white
felt
hat
offered
to
let
the
women
know
what
was
happening
after
every
bull
that
juan
killed
he
would
send
some
urchin
with
news
all
the
same
he
was
furious
at
the
incivility
of
his
illustrious
who
had
not
even
offered
him
a
seat
in
the
carriage
with
the
cuadrilla
to
drive
to
the
plaza
gallardo
knew
the
soil
he
was
treading
it
was
familiar
to
him
and
was
in
a
sense
his
own
the
sand
of
the
different
plazas
exercised
an
influence
on
his
superstitious
temperament
he
recalled
the
large
plazas
of
valencia
and
barcelona
with
their
white
sand
the
dark
sand
of
the
northern
plazas
and
the
red
sand
of
the
huge
circus
in
madrid
but
the
sand
in
seville
was
different
from
any
other
drawn
from
the
guadalquivir
it
was
a
bright
yellow
like
pulverized
ochre
the
architecture
of
the
buildings
too
had
a
certain
influence
over
him
some
built
in
roman
style
others
again
moorish
but
the
plaza
of
seville
was
like
a
cathedral
full
of
memories
there
the
glorious
inventors
of
different
strokes
had
brought
their
art
to
perfection
the
school
of
ronda
with
its
steady
and
dignified
fighting
and
the
school
of
seville
with
its
light
play
and
mobility
which
caught
the
public
fancy
and
it
was
there
that
he
too
this
afternoon
would
be
intoxicated
by
the
applause
by
the
sun
by
the
roar
of
the
crowd
possibly
by
the
sight
of
a
blue
bodice
and
a
white
mantilla
leaning
over
the
edge
of
a
box
and
he
felt
capable
of
the
most
reckless
hardihood
anxious
to
outshine
his
companions
and
monopolize
all
the
applause
gallardo
seemed
to
fill
the
circus
with
his
agility
and
boldness
never
had
he
been
in
such
form
don
josé
after
each
one
of
his
splendid
strokes
stood
up
shouting
challenging
invisible
enemies
hidden
among
the
benches
who
dares
to
say
anything
against
him
the
first
man
in
the
world
at
gallardo
order
el
nacional
by
clever
brought
his
master
second
bull
in
front
of
the
box
where
the
blue
bodice
with
the
white
mantilla
was
seated
it
was
doña
sol
accompanied
by
the
marquis
and
his
two
daughters
followed
by
the
eyes
of
the
audience
gallardo
approached
the
barrier
holding
his
rapier
and
the
muleta
in
one
hand
when
he
arrived
opposite
the
box
he
stopped
took
off
his
montera
and
offered
the
bull
as
homage
to
the
marquis
niece
many
people
smiled
maliciously
olé
the
lad
has
good
luck
he
gave
a
half
turn
threw
his
montera
behind
him
when
he
had
ended
the
brindis
and
waited
for
the
bull
which
the
peons
were
bringing
up
to
him
by
dexterous
keeping
the
animal
in
a
very
limited
space
he
prevented
it
moving
away
from
that
spot
and
successfully
accomplished
his
task
he
wanted
to
kill
under
doña
sol
eyes
so
that
she
should
see
him
close
at
the
moment
when
he
defied
danger
every
pass
from
his
muleta
drew
forth
exclamations
of
enthusiasm
and
cries
of
anxiety
the
horn
seemed
to
graze
his
chest
it
seemed
impossible
that
blood
should
not
flow
after
the
bull
attacks
suddenly
he
squared
himself
the
rapier
well
in
line
forward
and
before
the
public
could
give
its
advice
by
shouts
or
counsels
he
had
thrown
himself
swiftly
on
the
bull
and
for
a
few
instants
man
and
bull
looked
as
one
body
when
the
man
disengaged
himself
the
bull
rushed
forward
with
uncertain
step
bellowing
its
tongue
hanging
from
its
mouth
and
the
red
pommel
of
the
rapier
scarcely
visible
on
the
crest
of
its
bloody
neck
after
a
few
steps
it
fell
the
spectators
rose
to
their
feet
as
one
man
and
a
hail
of
applause
and
furious
shouting
burst
from
all
parts
of
the
amphitheatre
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
as
brave
as
gallardo
had
that
man
ever
felt
fear
the
espada
saluted
before
the
box
opening
his
arms
with
the
rapier
and
muleta
in
either
hand
while
the
hands
of
doña
sol
clapped
feverish
applause
then
something
small
was
passed
down
from
spectator
to
spectator
from
the
box
down
to
the
barrier
it
was
the
lady
handkerchief
the
one
which
she
had
held
in
her
hand
a
small
scented
square
of
lawn
and
lace
passed
through
a
diamond
ring
which
she
presented
to
the
torero
in
acknowledgment
of
his
brindis
the
applause
broke
out
afresh
on
seeing
this
recognition
and
the
attention
of
the
public
hitherto
fixed
on
the
matador
was
now
turned
on
doña
sol
many
turning
their
backs
on
the
circus
to
look
at
her
and
extolling
her
beauty
with
the
familiarity
of
andalusian
gallantry
then
a
small
hairy
and
still
warm
triangle
was
passed
up
from
hand
to
hand
to
the
box
it
was
the
bull
ear
sent
by
the
matador
in
witness
of
his
brindis
before
the
fiesta
was
ended
the
news
of
gallardo
great
triumph
had
spread
all
over
the
town
and
when
the
espada
returned
to
his
house
half
the
neighbourhood
had
assembled
to
applaud
him
as
though
they
had
all
been
at
the
corrida
the
saddler
forgetting
his
annoyance
with
the
espada
admired
him
even
more
for
his
friendly
relations
with
the
nobility
than
for
his
exploits
in
the
he
had
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
certain
appointment
and
he
made
very
little
doubt
about
getting
it
seeing
his
intimacy
with
the
best
people
in
seville
show
them
the
ring
my
goodness
encarnacion
what
a
present
it
is
worthy
of
roger
de
flor
the
ring
passed
from
hand
to
hand
with
cries
of
admiration
from
the
women
carmen
only
pursed
up
her
lips
on
seeing
it
yes
it
is
very
pretty
and
she
passed
it
on
hurriedly
to
her
as
if
it
burnt
her
fingers
after
this
corrida
the
travelling
season
began
gallardo
had
more
engagements
than
in
any
previous
year
after
the
corridas
in
madrid
he
was
to
fight
in
every
plaza
in
spain
his
manager
was
nearly
distracted
over
the
railway
time
tables
making
endless
calculations
for
the
future
guidance
of
his
matador
gallardo
went
from
triumph
to
triumph
never
had
he
been
in
such
good
form
he
seemed
to
have
gained
fresh
strength
before
the
corridas
cruel
doubts
overwhelmed
him
tremors
nearly
akin
to
fear
such
as
he
had
never
known
in
his
early
days
when
he
was
only
beginning
to
make
his
name
but
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
the
arena
these
fears
vanished
and
an
almost
savage
bravery
possessed
him
which
was
always
accompanied
by
fresh
laurels
when
his
work
was
over
in
some
provincial
town
and
he
returned
to
the
hotel
with
his
cuadrilla
for
they
all
lived
together
he
would
sit
down
perspiring
wearied
with
the
pleasant
fatigue
of
triumph
and
before
he
could
change
his
gala
dress
all
the
wiseacres
in
the
locality
would
come
to
congratulate
him
he
had
been
colossal
he
was
the
first
torero
in
the
world
that
estocada
of
the
fourth
bull
yes
indeed
said
gallardo
with
almost
childish
pride
really
i
was
not
bad
in
that
with
the
interminable
verbosity
of
all
conversations
about
bulls
the
time
passed
without
either
the
espada
or
his
friends
wearying
of
talking
about
the
afternoon
corridas
or
about
those
of
previous
years
night
fell
the
lights
were
lit
but
still
the
aficionados
did
not
go
the
cuadrilla
according
to
discipline
listened
silently
to
all
this
babel
of
talk
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
as
long
as
the
master
had
not
given
his
permission
his
lads
could
neither
undress
nor
sup
the
picadors
fatigued
by
the
iron
armour
on
their
legs
and
the
terrible
bruises
resulting
from
their
falls
from
horseback
held
their
coarse
beaver
hats
between
their
knees
the
banderilleros
their
skintight
silk
garments
wet
with
perspiration
were
all
hungry
after
their
afternoon
violent
exercise
all
were
thinking
the
same
thing
and
casting
furious
looks
at
these
enthusiasts
when
on
earth
will
those
tiresome
idiots
leave
curse
their
hearts
at
last
the
matador
noticed
them
you
may
go
he
said
and
the
cuadrilla
escaped
pushing
each
other
like
school
boys
let
loose
while
the
maestro
continued
listening
to
the
praises
of
the
connoisseurs
and
garabato
waited
silently
to
undress
him
on
his
days
of
rest
the
maestro
free
from
the
excitements
of
danger
and
glory
turned
his
thoughts
towards
seville
now
and
then
one
of
those
short
little
perfumed
notes
came
for
him
congratulating
him
on
his
triumphs
ay
if
only
doña
sol
were
with
him
there
were
moments
in
which
he
felt
compelled
to
confide
his
sadness
to
el
nacional
with
that
irresistible
impulse
of
confession
which
all
feel
who
carry
a
heavy
weight
in
their
hearts
besides
now
he
was
away
from
seville
he
felt
a
greater
affection
for
the
banderillero
a
kind
of
reflected
tenderness
sebastian
knew
of
his
loves
with
doña
sol
he
had
seen
her
though
from
afar
and
she
had
often
laughed
when
gallardo
told
her
of
the
picador
originalities
sebastian
received
his
master
confidences
with
severe
looks
what
you
have
got
to
do
juan
is
to
forget
this
lady
family
peace
is
worth
more
than
anything
to
us
who
knock
about
the
world
constantly
exposed
to
danger
and
liable
to
be
brought
home
any
day
feet
foremost
see
carmen
knows
a
great
deal
more
than
you
think
she
is
perfectly
acquainted
with
everything
and
she
has
even
questioned
me
indirectly
as
to
your
relations
with
the
marquis
niece
poor
little
thing
it
is
a
shame
to
make
her
suffer
she
has
a
temper
and
if
you
arouse
it
it
may
give
you
some
trouble
but
gallardo
away
from
his
family
and
with
his
thoughts
dominated
by
the
remembrance
of
doña
sol
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
dangers
of
which
el
nacional
spoke
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
these
sentimental
scruples
he
felt
the
need
of
speaking
of
his
remembrances
of
making
his
friend
the
confidant
of
his
past
happiness
you
do
not
know
what
that
woman
is
you
are
an
unlucky
man
sebastian
who
does
not
know
what
is
good
take
all
the
beautiful
women
in
seville
together
they
are
as
nothing
see
all
those
we
meet
on
our
travels
neither
are
they
anything
there
is
only
one
doña
sol
and
when
you
know
a
woman
like
that
you
do
not
want
to
know
any
others
if
you
only
knew
her
as
i
do
gacho
women
of
our
class
reek
of
health
and
clean
linen
but
this
one
sebastian
this
one
picture
to
yourself
all
the
roses
in
the
gardens
of
the
alcazar
no
something
better
still
jasmine
honeysuckle
all
the
bewildering
perfumes
of
the
gardens
of
paradise
and
those
sweet
scents
seem
to
belong
to
her
not
as
if
she
put
them
on
but
as
if
they
were
flowering
in
her
veins
besides
she
is
not
one
of
those
who
once
seen
are
always
the
same
with
her
there
is
always
something
still
to
desire
something
to
hope
for
something
which
is
never
attained
i
can
not
sebastian
express
myself
better
but
you
do
not
know
what
a
great
lady
is
so
do
preach
any
more
and
shut
your
beak
gallardo
no
longer
received
any
letters
from
seville
doña
sol
was
abroad
he
saw
her
once
when
he
was
fighting
in
san
sebastian
the
beautiful
woman
was
staying
in
biarritz
and
she
came
over
with
some
french
ladies
who
wished
to
know
the
torero
after
that
he
heard
very
little
of
her
only
from
the
few
letters
he
got
and
from
the
news
his
manager
collected
from
the
marquis
de
moraima
she
was
at
the
seaside
then
he
heard
she
had
gone
to
england
then
to
germany
and
gallardo
despaired
of
ever
seeing
her
again
this
possibility
saddened
the
torero
and
revealed
the
ascendancy
this
woman
had
gained
both
over
himself
and
his
will
never
to
see
her
again
why
then
should
he
expose
his
life
and
become
famous
of
what
use
was
the
applause
of
the
populace
his
manager
reassured
him
she
would
return
he
was
quite
certain
even
if
it
were
only
for
a
year
for
doña
sol
with
all
her
mad
caprices
was
a
very
practical
woman
and
knew
how
to
look
after
what
belonged
to
her
she
needed
her
uncle
assistance
to
disentangle
the
most
involved
affairs
both
of
her
own
and
her
late
husband
fortune
produced
by
their
long
and
expensive
stay
abroad
the
espada
returned
to
seville
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
he
had
still
a
good
many
corridas
for
the
autumn
but
he
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
a
month
rest
during
the
absence
of
his
family
at
the
baths
of
san
lucar
gallardo
shivered
with
emotion
when
one
day
his
manager
announced
the
unexpected
return
of
doña
sol
he
went
to
see
her
at
once
but
after
the
first
few
words
felt
intimidated
by
her
cold
amiability
and
the
expression
of
her
eyes
she
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
different
in
her
glance
a
certain
surprise
at
his
rough
exterior
at
the
difference
between
herself
and
this
man
the
matador
of
bulls
could
be
guessed
he
also
felt
this
gulf
which
seemed
opening
between
them
he
looked
at
her
as
though
she
were
another
woman
a
great
lady
of
a
different
race
and
country
they
talked
quietly
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
past
and
gallardo
did
not
dare
to
remind
her
of
it
nor
to
make
the
slightest
advance
fearing
one
of
her
outbursts
of
anger
seville
said
doña
sol
it
is
very
beautiful
very
pleasant
but
there
is
more
in
the
world
i
warn
you
gallardo
that
some
day
i
shall
take
flight
for
ever
i
guess
that
i
shall
be
bored
to
death
my
seville
seems
quite
changed
she
no
longer
tutoyed
him
and
it
was
many
days
before
the
torero
dared
during
his
visits
to
make
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
past
he
confined
himself
to
gazing
at
her
in
silence
with
his
moist
and
adoring
moorish
eyes
i
am
bored
some
day
i
shall
go
away
she
exclaimed
at
all
these
interviews
other
times
the
imposing
servant
would
receive
the
torero
at
the
wicket
and
tell
him
the
señora
was
out
when
he
knew
quite
certainly
that
she
was
at
home
gallardo
told
her
one
evening
of
a
short
excursion
he
was
obliged
to
make
to
his
farm
of
la
rinconada
he
wanted
to
see
some
olive
yards
his
manager
had
bought
for
him
during
his
absence
and
added
to
the
property
he
wanted
also
to
look
after
the
general
work
the
idea
of
accompanying
the
espada
on
this
expedition
delighted
doña
sol
to
go
to
that
grange
where
gallardo
family
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
year
to
enter
with
the
startling
scandal
of
irregularity
and
sin
into
the
quiet
atmosphere
of
that
country
house
where
the
poor
fellow
lived
with
his
belongings
the
absurdity
of
the
wish
decided
her
she
also
would
go
the
idea
of
seeing
la
rinconada
interested
her
gallardo
felt
afraid
he
thought
of
all
the
farm
people
of
the
gossips
who
would
probably
tell
his
family
of
this
trip
but
doña
sol
glance
beat
down
all
his
scruples
who
could
tell
possibly
this
trip
might
bring
on
a
return
of
their
former
intimacy
all
the
same
he
wished
to
oppose
one
obstacle
to
this
wish
how
about
el
plumitas
according
to
what
i
hear
he
is
wandering
round
la
rinconada
ah
el
plumitas
doña
sol
face
darkened
by
boredom
seemed
to
light
up
with
an
inward
flame
how
curious
i
should
be
so
delighted
if
you
could
present
him
to
me
gallardo
arranged
the
journey
he
had
thought
of
going
alone
but
doña
sol
company
obliged
him
to
seek
an
escort
fearing
some
evil
encounter
on
the
road
he
looked
up
potaje
the
picador
he
was
extremely
rough
fearing
nothing
in
the
world
but
his
gipsy
wife
who
when
she
was
tired
of
being
beaten
would
turn
and
bite
him
there
would
be
no
need
to
give
him
any
explanations
only
wine
in
abundance
alcohol
and
his
atrocious
falls
in
the
arena
seemed
to
keep
him
in
a
perpetual
muddle
as
if
his
head
were
buzzing
and
only
permitted
his
few
slow
words
and
a
cloudy
vision
of
everything
he
ordered
also
el
nacional
to
accompany
them
he
would
be
one
more
and
was
of
tried
discretion
the
banderillero
obeyed
from
subordination
but
he
grumbled
when
he
knew
doña
sol
was
going
with
them
by
the
life
of
the
blue
dove
to
think
of
the
father
of
a
family
mixing
himself
up
in
such
ugly
doings
what
will
carmen
and
the
señora
angustias
say
of
me
when
they
come
to
hear
of
it
but
when
he
found
himself
in
the
open
country
seated
by
the
side
of
potaje
in
front
of
the
espada
and
the
great
lady
his
annoyance
gradually
vanished
he
could
not
see
her
well
wrapped
up
as
she
was
in
a
large
blue
veil
which
covered
her
travelling
cap
and
falling
over
her
yellow
silk
coat
but
she
was
very
beautiful
and
to
hear
them
talk
what
things
she
knew
before
the
journey
was
half
over
el
nacional
in
spite
of
his
years
of
conjugal
fidelity
forgave
his
master
weakness
and
quite
understood
his
infatuation
if
ever
he
found
himself
in
a
like
situation
he
would
do
exactly
the
same
education
it
was

received
this

through

and
passed
it
on
to

who
was
waiting
on
the
stairs

to
say
who
he
is
otherwise
the

wo
get
up
it
was
eight
and
the
banderillero
went
to
a
window
to
watch
the
farm
servant
who
ran
down
the
road
in
front
of
the
grange
till
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
distant
fence
which
bounded
the
property
close
to
the
entrance
through
this
fence
he
saw
a
rider
who
appeared
very
small
in
the
distance
both
man
and
horse
looking
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
a
toy
box
a
short
time
afterwards
the
labourer
returned
having
talked
with
the
rider
el
nacional
who
seemed
interested
by
these
comings
and
goings
waited
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
he
says
he
must
see
the
master
mumbled
the
shepherd
stammering
he
seems
to
me
up
to
no
good
he
says
the
master
must
come
down
at
once
as
he
has
something
important
to
tell
him
the
banderillero
returned
to
knock
at
his
master
door
paying
no
attention
to
his
grumbling
he
ought
to
get
up
it
was
a
late
hour
for
the
country
and
the
man
might
bring
some
important
message
i
coming
said
gallardo
without
however
moving
from
his
bed
el
nacional
went
again
to
the
window
and
saw
the
rider
coming
up
the
road
towards
the
house
the
shepherd
was
going
to
meet
him
with
the
reply
the
poor
man
seemed
uneasy
and
in
his
two
dialogues
with
the
banderillero
had
stuttered
with
an
expression
of
fright
and
doubt
but
had
not
dared
to
disclose
his
thoughts
after
rejoining
the
rider
he
listened
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
retraced
his
steps
running
towards
the
farm
but
this
time
very
quickly
el
nacional
heard
him
running
up
the
stairs
no
less
quickly
coming
up
to
him
pale
and
trembling
it
is
el
plumitas
seño
sebastian
he
says
he
is
plumitas
and
that
he
must
see
the
master
my
heart
beat
directly
i
saw
him
el
plumitas
the
shepherd
voice
in
spite
of
being
shaking
and
breathless
seemed
to
penetrate
throughout
the
whole
house
as
he
pronounced
that
name
the
banderillero
stood
dumb
with
surprise
and
from
the
espada
room
came
a
volley
of
oaths
the
rustle
of
clothes
and
the
sound
of
some
one
throwing
himself
roughly
out
of
bed
from
the
room
occupied
by
doña
sol
other
sounds
also
came
which
seemed
in
answer
to
this
astounding
news
curse
him
what
does
the
man
want
why
has
he
come
to
la
rincona
especially
just
now
gallardo
came
quickly
out
of
his
room
having
only
drawn
his
trousers
and
jacket
over
his
night
clothes
he
ran
on
before
the
banderillero
with
the
blind
impulsiveness
of
his
character
throwing
himself
in
hot
haste
down
the
stairs
followed
by
el
nacional
at
the
entrance
of
the
farm
the
rider
was
dismounting
a
shepherd
held
the
horse
reins
and
the
other
labourers
gathered
in
a
group
at
a
short
distance
watching
the
new
comer
with
curiosity
and
respect
the
new
comer
was
a
man
of
medium
stature
rather
short
than
tall
plump
faced
fair
with
short
strong
limbs
he
was
dressed
in
a
grey
jacket
trimmed
with
black
braid
breeches
with
a
large
piece
of
leather
inside
the
knee
and
leather
gaiters
wrinkled
and
cracked
by
the
sun
and
the
rain
underneath
his
jacket
his
waist
seemed
swelled
out
by
the
folds
of
a
large
silk
waist
sash
and
a
cartridge
box
to
which
were
added
the
thickness
of
a
revolver
and
a
large
knife
passed
through
his
belt
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
a
repeating
carbine
his
head
was
covered
by
a
sombrero
which
had
once
been
white
but
which
was
now
stained
and
ragged
by
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
a
red
handkerchief
knotted
round
his
throat
was
the
most
showy
part
of
his
dress
his
broad
chubby
face
had
the
placidity
of
a
full
moon
on
his
cheeks
whose
whiteness
showed
through
the
coat
of
sunburn
sprouted
a
red
beard
unshaven
for
several
days
the
eyes
were
the
only
disquieting
things
in
this
face
which
looked
as
if
it
must
belong
to
a
village
sacristan
they
were
small
triangular
eyes
sunk
in
rolls
of
fat
little
pig
eyes
with
a
malignant
dark
blue
pupil
as
gallardo
appeared
at
the
door
the
man
recognized
him
at
once
raising
his
sombrero
from
his
round
head
god
give
us
a
good
day
seño
juan
he
said
with
the
grave
courtesy
of
an
andalusian
peasant
good
day
are
your
family
quite
well
seño
juan
quite
well
thanks
and
yours
enquired
the
espada
automatically
from
habit
i
believe
they
are
quite
well
but
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
them
the
two
men
were
standing
close
together
examining
each
other
as
naturally
as
possible
as
if
they
were
two
wayfarers
who
had
met
in
the
country
the
torero
was
pale
compressing
his
lips
to
hide
his
feelings
did
the
bandit
think
he
was
going
to
frighten
him
possibly
at
another
time
this
visit
might
have
scared
him
but
now
having
upstairs
what
he
had
he
felt
capable
of
fighting
him
just
as
if
he
had
been
a
bull
directly
he
declared
his
evil
intentions
a
few
moments
passed
in
silence
all
the
farm
men
about
a
dozen
who
had
not
gone
out
to
work
in
the
fields
were
looking
with
almost
childish
wonder
at
this
terrible
personage
whose
very
name
obsessed
them
with
its
gloomy
fame
can
they
take
the
mare
round
to
the
stable
to
rest
a
little
enquired
the
bandit
gallardo
signed
to
a
man
who
took
the
reins
and
walked
away
with
her
take
good
care
of
her
said
plumitas
mia
is
the
best
thing
i
have
in
the
world
and
i
love
her
more
than
wife
or
children
a
fresh
personage
had
joined
the
group
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
amazed
people
it
was
potaje
the
picador
who
came
out
half
dressed
and
stretching
himself
with
all
the
rough
strength
of
his
athletic
body
he
rubbed
his
eyes
always
bloodshot
and
inflamed
by
drink
and
approaching
the
bandit
let
one
huge
hand
fall
on
his
shoulder
with
studied
familiarity
as
if
he
enjoyed
feeling
him
squirm
under
his
grasp
and
wished
at
the
same
time
to
express
his
rough
sympathy
how
are
you
plumitas
he
saw
him
for
the
first
time
the
bandit
drew
himself
together
as
if
he
intended
to
resent
this
rough
and
unceremonious
caress
and
his
right
hand
raised
the
rifle
however
fixing
his
little
blue
eyes
on
the
picador
he
seemed
to
recognize
him
you
are
potaje
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
saw
you
spear
in
seville
at
the
last
fair
good
lord
how
you
fell
how
strong
you
are
one
would
think
you
were
made
of
iron
and
as
if
to
return
the
salute
he
seized
the
picador
arm
with
his
horny
hand
feeling
his
biceps
with
admiration
the
two
stood
looking
at
each
other
till
the
picador
gave
a
deep
laugh
jo
jo
i
thought
you
were
much
bigger
plumitas
but
that
does
not
matter
for
in
spite
of
it
you
are
a
fine
fellow
the
bandit
turned
to
the
espada
can
i
breakfast
here
gallardo
put
on
the
look
of
a
great
nobleman
no
one
who
comes
to
la
rincona
leaves
it
without
breakfast
they
all
entered
the
farm
kitchen
an
immense
room
with
a
large
wide
open
chimney
which
was
the
general
gathering
place
the
espada
sat
down
in
an
and
a
girl
the
daughter
busied
herself
with
putting
on
his
boots
for
in
his
hurry
he
had
run
down
in
his
slippers
el
nacional
wishing
to
give
signs
of
his
existence
and
reassured
by
the
courteous
manner
of
the
visitor
appeared
with
a
bottle
of
country
wine
and
some
glasses
i
know
you
also
said
the
bandit
treating
him
as
familiarly
as
the
picador
i
have
seen
you
fix
in
banderillas
when
you
like
you
can
do
well
enough
but
you
must
throw
yourself
on
the
bull
better
potaje
and
the
maestro
laughed
at
this
advice
as
he
took
up
the
glass
plumitas
found
himself
embarrassed
by
his
carbine
which
he
had
placed
between
his
knees
put
it
down
man
said
the
picador
do
you
stick
to
your
weapon
when
you
are
paying
a
visit
the
bandit
became
suddenly
serious
it
was
all
right
so
it
was
his
usual
habit
the
carbine
kept
him
company
everywhere
even
when
he
slept
this
allusion
to
his
weapon
which
seemed
another
limb
of
his
body
made
him
grave
he
looked
all
round
uneasily
and
suspiciously
with
the
habit
of
living
constantly
on
the
alert
trusting
no
one
confiding
in
nothing
but
his
own
endeavours
and
feeling
danger
constantly
all
round
him
a
shepherd
crossed
the
kitchen
going
towards
the
door
where
is
that
man
going
to
as
he
asked
this
he
sat
upright
in
his
chair
drawing
his
loaded
carbine
closer
to
his
breast
with
his
knees
he
was
going
to
a
large
field
near
where
the
rest
of
the
labourers
were
working
plumitas
seemed
tranquillized
listen
here
seño
juan
i
have
come
here
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
and
because
i
know
you
are
a
caballero
incapable
of
breathing
a
word
besides
you
will
have
heard
of
plumitas
it
is
not
easy
to
catch
him
and
he
who
tries
it
will
pay
for
it
the
picador
intervened
before
his
master
could
speak
do
be
a
brute
plumitas
you
are
here
among
comrades
as
long
as
you
behave
well
and
decently
and
at
once
the
bandit
seemed
reassured
and
began
to
speak
of
his
mare
praising
her
qualities
and
the
two
men
hobnobbed
with
the
enthusiasm
of
mountain
riders
who
love
a
horse
far
better
than
a
man
gallardo
who
still
seemed
anxious
walked
about
the
kitchen
where
some
of
the
farm
women
swarthy
and
masculine
were
preparing
the
breakfast
looking
sideways
at
the
celebrated
plumitas
in
one
of
his
turns
the
espada
came
up
to
el
nacional
he
must
go
to
doña
sol
room
and
ask
her
not
to
come
down
the
bandit
would
most
probably
leave
after
breakfast
and
why
show
herself
to
that
redoubtable
personage
the
banderillero
disappeared
and
plumitas
seeing
the
maestro
apart
from
the
others
went
up
to
him
inquiring
with
great
interest
about
the
remaining
corridas
of
the
year
i
am
a
gallardista
you
know
i
have
applauded
you
oftener
than
you
could
imagine
i
have
seen
you
in
seville
in
jaen
in
cordoba
in
ever
so
many
places
gallardo
was
astounded
how
could
he
who
had
a
real
army
of
soldiers
after
him
go
quietly
to
a
corrida
of
bulls
plumitas
smiled
with
superiority
bah
i
go
wherever
i
like
i
am
everywhere
then
he
spoke
of
the
occasions
on
which
he
had
met
the
espada
on
the
way
to
the
farm
sometimes
accompanied
at
other
times
alone
passing
close
to
him
on
the
road
and
taking
no
notice
of
him
thinking
him
probably
some
poor
shepherd
riding
to
deliver
a
message
at
some
hut
close
by
when
you
came
from
seville
to
buy
those
two
mills
down
there
i
met
you
on
the
road
you
had
then
five
thousand
duros
on
you
had
you
not
tell
the
truth
you
see
i
was
well
informed
another
time
i
saw
you
in
one
of
those
animals
they
call
automobiles
with
another
gentleman
from
seville
your
manager
i
believe
you
were
going
to
sign
the
papers
for
the
oliver
del
cura
and
you
had
a
much
larger
pot
of
money
with
you
that
time
little
by
little
gallardo
recalled
the
exactitude
of
those
facts
looking
with
wonder
at
this
man
who
seemed
to
be
informed
about
everything
the
bandit
in
order
to
show
his
generosity
to
the
torero
on
those
occasions
spoke
of
the
ease
with
which
he
surmounted
difficulties
you
see
about
those
automobiles
it
is
a
trifle
i
can
stop
one
of
those
with
only
this
showing
his
carbine
once
in
cordoba
i
had
some
accounts
to
settle
with
a
rich
gentleman
who
was
my
enemy
i
drew
up
my
mare
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
when
that
came
along
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
stinking
of
petroleum
i
shouted
he
did
not
choose
to
stop
so
i
put
a
ball
into
one
of
his
wheels
to
cut
it
short
the
automobile
stopped
a
little
further
on
and
i
galloped
up
and
settled
my
accounts
with
the
fellow
a
man
who
can
put
a
ball
wherever
he
chooses
can
stop
anything
on
the
road
gallardo
felt
more
and
more
astonished
as
he
heard
plumitas
tell
of
his
exploits
on
the
road
with
quite
professional
simplicity
i
did
not
wish
to
stop
you
you
are
not
one
of
those
rich
men
you
are
a
poor
man
like
myself
only
you
have
better
luck
more
than
enough
in
your
profession
if
you
have
made
money
you
have
earned
it
well
i
like
you
because
you
are
a
fine
matador
and
i
have
a
weakness
for
brave
men
the
two
of
us
are
like
comrades
we
both
live
by
exposing
our
lives
for
this
reason
although
you
did
not
know
me
i
was
there
seeing
you
pass
without
even
asking
a
cigarette
from
you
for
fear
that
some
rascal
should
take
advantage
by
going
on
the
highway
and
saying
he
was
plumitas
stranger
things
have
happened
an
unexpected
apparition
cut
short
the
bandit
speech
and
the
face
changed
to
a
look
of
extreme
annoyance
curse
it
doña
sol
had
not
el
nacional
given
his
message
the
banderillero
followed
the
lady
making
various
signs
from
the
kitchen
door
which
meant
that
all
his
prayers
and
advice
had
been
useless
doña
sol
came
down
in
her
travelling
coat
her
golden
hair
combed
and
knotted
hurriedly
el
plumitas
in
the
farm
what
joy
part
of
the
night
she
had
been
thinking
of
him
proposing
on
the
following
morning
to
ride
about
the
solitudes
around
la
rinconada
in
the
hopes
that
good
luck
would
make
her
run
against
the
interesting
bandit
and
as
if
her
thoughts
exercised
a
far
distant
influence
in
attracting
people
the
bandit
had
obeyed
her
wishes
and
had
appeared
early
in
the
grange
el
plumitas
the
name
alone
called
up
the
full
figure
of
the
bandit
before
her
imagination
she
scarcely
needed
to
know
him
she
would
scarcely
feel
any
surprise
she
saw
him
tall
slim
of
dark
complexion
a
pointed
hat
placed
over
a
red
handkerchief
from
under
which
appeared
curls
of
hair
as
black
as
jet
she
saw
an
active
man
dressed
in
black
velvet
his
slim
waist
encircled
by
a
purple
silk
sash
and
his
legs
in
gaiters
of
a
fine
date
colour
a
veritable
knight
errant
of
the
andalusian
steppes
her
eyes
wide
open
with
excitement
wandered
over
the
kitchen
without
seeing
either
a
pointed
hat
or
a
blunderbus
she
saw
an
unknown
man
standing
up
a
kind
of
keeper
with
a
carbine
just
like
any
of
those
she
had
so
often
seen
on
estates
belonging
to
her
family
good
day
señora
marquesa
your
uncle
the
marquis
is
he
quite
well
the
looks
of
every
one
converging
on
that
man
told
her
the
truth
ay
and
that
was
plumitas
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
with
clumsy
courtesy
abashed
by
the
presence
and
continued
standing
with
his
carbine
in
one
hand
and
the
old
felt
hat
in
the
other
gallardo
was
fairly
astounded
at
the
bandit
address
that
man
seemed
to
know
every
one
he
knew
who
doña
sol
was
and
by
an
excess
of
respect
extended
to
her
the
titles
belonging
to
her
family
the
lady
recovering
from
her
surprise
signed
to
him
to
sit
down
and
cover
himself
but
though
he
obeyed
the
first
he
left
the
felt
hat
on
a
chair
close
by
as
if
he
guessed
the
question
in
doña
sol
eyes
which
were
fixed
on
him
he
added
the
señora
marquesa
must
not
be
surprised
at
my
knowing
her
i
have
seen
her
very
often
with
the
marquis
and
others
going
to
the
trial
of
the
calves
i
have
seen
also
from
afar
how
the
señora
attacked
the
young
bulls
with
her
garrocha
the
señora
is
very
brave
and
the
handsomest
woman
i
have
seen
on
god
earth
it
is
a
pure
delight
to
see
her
on
horseback
and
men
ought
to
fight
for
her
heavenly
blue
eyes
the
bandit
was
drawn
on
quite
naturally
by
his
southern
warmth
to
seek
fresh
expressions
of
admiration
for
doña
sol
she
had
grown
paler
and
her
eyes
were
wide
open
with
half
pleased
terror
she
began
to
find
the
bandit
decidedly
interesting
had
he
come
to
the
farm
only
for
her
did
he
propose
to
carry
her
off
to
his
hiding
places
in
the
mountains
the
torero
grew
alarmed
hearing
these
expressions
of
rough
admiration
curse
him
in
his
own
house
before
his
very
face
if
he
went
on
like
this
he
would
go
up
and
fetch
his
gun
and
even
though
plumitas
were
the
other
one
they
would
see
which
one
would
carry
her
off
the
bandit
seemed
to
understand
the
annoyance
his
words
had
caused
and
went
on
most
respectfully
your
pardon
señora
marquesa
it
is
idle
talk
and
nothing
more
i
have
a
wife
and
four
children
who
weep
for
me
more
than
the
virgin
of
sorrows
i
am
an
unhappy
man
who
is
what
he
is
because
bad
luck
has
pursued
him
as
if
he
were
endeavouring
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
doña
sol
he
broke
out
into
praises
of
her
family
the
marquis
de
moraima
was
one
of
the
most
honourable
men
in
the
world
if
only
all
rich
men
were
like
him
my
father
worked
for
him
and
often
spoke
of
his
kindness
i
spent
one
hot
weather
in
the
hut
of
one
of
his
shepherds
he
knew
it
and
never
said
a
word
he
has
given
orders
on
all
his
farms
to
give
me
what
i
want
and
to
leave
me
in
peace
these
things
are
never
forgotten
there
are
so
many
rich
rascals
in
the
world
very
often
i
have
met
him
alone
riding
his
horse
like
a
young
man
as
if
years
had
stood
still
for
him
with
god
seño
marque
health
my
lad
he
did
not
know
me
and
could
not
guess
who
i
was
because
my
companion
touching
his
carbine
was
hidden
under
my
blanket
and
i
should
have
wished
to
stop
him
to
take
his
hand
not
to
shake
it
that
no
how
could
so
good
a
man
shake
hands
with
me
who
have
so
many
deaths
and
mutilations
on
my
soul
but
to
kiss
it
as
if
he
were
my
father
and
to
thank
him
for
what
he
has
done
for
me
the
vehemence
with
which
he
spoke
of
his
gratitude
did
not
move
doña
sol
and
so
that
was
the
famous
plumitas
a
poor
sort
of
man
a
good
country
rabbit
whom
every
one
looked
on
as
a
wolf
deceived
by
his
fame
there
are
very
bad
rich
men
went
on
the
bandit
what
some
of
them
make
the
poor
suffer
near
my
village
lives
one
who
lends
money
on
usury
and
who
is
more
perverse
than
judas
i
sent
him
a
notice
that
he
should
not
cause
trouble
to
the
people
and
he
the
thief
gave
information
to
the
civil
guards
to
search
for
me
result
that
i
burnt
his
and
did
a
few
other
little
things
and
he
was
more
than
a
year
without
ever
daring
to
go
into
seville
for
fear
of
meeting
plumitas
another
man
was
going
to
evict
a
poor
old
woman
from
the
house
in
which
her
parents
had
lived
because
she
had
not
paid
any
rent
for
a
year
i
went
to
see
the
gentleman
one
evening
when
he
was
sitting
at
table
with
his
family
master
i
am
el
plumitas
and
i
want
a
hundred
duros
he
gave
them
to
me
and
i
took
them
to
the
old
woman
granny
take
these
pay
that
jew
what
you
owe
him
and
keep
the
rest
for
yourself
and
may
they
bring
you
luck
doña
sol
looked
at
the
bandit
with
more
interest
and
dead
men
she
enquired
how
many
have
you
killed
lady
we
will
not
speak
of
that
said
the
bandit
gravely
you
would
take
a
dislike
to
me
and
after
all
i
am
only
an
unhappy
man
whom
they
are
trying
to
trap
and
who
defends
himself
as
best
he
can
there
was
a
long
silence
you
can
not
imagine
how
i
live
señora
marquesa
he
went
on
the
wild
beasts
are
better
off
than
i
am
i
sleep
where
i
can
or
not
at
all
i
rise
on
one
side
of
the
province
and
lie
down
to
rest
on
the
other
i
have
to
keep
my
eyes
well
open
and
a
heavy
hand
so
that
they
may
respect
me
and
not
sell
me
the
poor
are
good
but
poverty
is
a
thing
that
turns
the
best
bad
if
they
had
not
been
afraid
of
me
they
would
have
betrayed
me
to
the
civil
guards
again
and
again
i
have
no
true
friends
but
my
mare
and
this
touching
his
carbine
now
and
then
i
feel
the
longing
to
see
my
wife
and
little
ones
and
i
go
by
night
into
my
village
all
the
neighbours
who
see
me
shut
their
eyes
but
some
day
this
will
end
badly
there
are
times
when
i
am
weary
of
solitude
and
feel
i
must
see
people
i
have
thought
for
a
long
time
of
coming
to
la
rincona
should
i
not
pay
a
visit
to
seño
juan
gallardo
i
who
admire
him
and
who
have
so
often
clapped
him
but
i
have
always
seen
you
with
so
many
friends
or
your
wife
and
your
mother
and
the
children
who
have
been
at
the
farm
i
know
what
that
means
they
would
have
died
of
fright
at
the
very
sight
of
plumitas
but
now
it
is
different
when
i
saw
you
come
with
the
señora
marquesa
i
said
to
myself
us
go
and
salute
these
señores
and
have
a
chat
with
them
and
the
cunning
smile
which
accompanied
these
words
at
once
established
a
difference
between
the
torero
family
and
that
woman
giving
them
to
understand
that
gallardo
relations
with
doña
sol
were
no
secret
to
him
in
the
bottom
of
this
rough
peasant
heart
was
a
deep
respect
for
legitimate
marriage
and
he
thought
himself
free
to
take
greater
liberties
with
the
torero
aristocratic
friend
than
with
the
poor
women
who
formed
his
family
doña
sol
took
no
notice
but
she
pressed
the
bandit
with
questions
as
to
how
he
had
come
to
be
what
he
was
it
was
injustice
señora
marquesa
one
of
those
misfortunes
which
fall
upon
us
poor
people
i
was
one
of
the
sharpest
in
my
village
and
the
labourers
always
put
me
as
spokesman
when
they
had
anything
to
ask
from
the
rich
people
i
can
read
and
write
for
i
became
sacristan
when
i
was
quite
a
boy
and
i
gained
my
name
of
plumitas
from
running
after
the
hens
and
plucking
out
their
tail
feathers
for
pens
a
thump
from
potaje
interrupted
him
comparé
i
had
already
thought
since
i
saw
you
that
you
were
a
church
rat
or
something
similar
el
nacional
was
silent
without
daring
to
remark
on
these
confidences
but
he
smiled
slightly
a
sacristan
turned
into
a
bandit
what
would
don
joselito
say
when
he
told
him
this
i
married
my
wife
and
our
first
child
was
born
one
night
two
civil
guards
came
to
our
house
and
carried
me
out
of
the
village
to
the
threshing
floors
some
one
had
fired
some
shots
at
the
door
of
a
rich
man
and
those
good
gentlemen
made
up
their
minds
it
was
i
denied
it
and
they
beat
me
with
their
carbines
i
denied
it
again
and
again
they
beat
me
to
cut
it
short
till
dawn
they
beat
me
all
over
the
body
sometimes
with
the
ramrods
sometimes
with
the
till
they
got
tired
and
i
became
unconscious
they
had
tied
both
my
hands
and
my
feet
and
beat
me
as
if
i
were
a
bundle
saying
you
not
the
bravest
in
your
village
get
up
and
defend
yourself
let
see
how
far
your
fists
can
reach
it
was
their
mockery
i
felt
the
most
my
poor
wife
cured
me
as
best
she
could
but
i
could
not
rest
i
could
not
live
remembering
the
blows
and
the
mockery
to
cut
it
short
again
one
day
one
of
those
civil
guards
was
found
dead
on
the
threshing
floor
and
i
to
save
myself
annoyance
fled
to
the
mountains
and
up
to
now
gacho
you
did
well
said
potaje
admiringly
and
the
other
one
i
know
not
i
think
he
must
still
be
alive
he
fled
from
the
village
with
all
his
valour
he
begged
to
be
removed
but
i
have
not
forgotten
him
some
day
i
shall
settle
with
him
sometimes
i
am
told
he
is
at
the
other
end
of
spain
and
there
i
go
i
would
go
if
it
were
to
hell
itself
i
leave
the
mare
and
the
carbine
with
some
friend
to
keep
for
me
and
i
take
the
train
like
a
gentleman
i
have
been
in
barcelona
in
valladolid
in
many
other
places
i
stand
near
the
prison
and
watch
the
civil
guards
who
go
in
and
out
is
not
my
man
neither
is
this
one
my
informants
must
have
been
mistaken
but
it
does
not
signify
i
have
searched
for
him
for
years
and
some
day
i
shall
meet
him
unless
he
be
dead
which
would
be
a
real
pity
doña
sol
followed
this
story
with
great
interest
what
an
original
figure
was
plumitas
she
had
been
mistaken
in
thinking
him
a
rabbit
the
bandit
was
silent
he
frowned
as
though
he
was
afraid
of
having
said
too
much
and
wished
to
avoid
further
confidences
with
your
permission
he
said
to
the
espada
i
will
go
to
the
stables
and
see
how
they
are
treating
the
mare
are
you
coming
comrade
you
will
see
something
good
potaje
accepting
the
invitation
they
left
the
kitchen
together
when
the
lady
and
the
torero
were
left
alone
his
ill
humour
broke
out
why
had
she
come
down
it
was
imprudent
to
show
herself
to
a
man
like
that
a
bandit
whose
name
was
the
terror
of
every
one
but
doña
sol
delighted
with
the
good
luck
of
the
meeting
laughed
at
the
espada
fears
the
bandit
seemed
a
good
sort
of
fellow
an
unfortunate
man
whose
evil
deeds
were
exaggerated
by
the
popular
imagination
i
had
fancied
him
different
but
in
any
case
i
am
delighted
to
have
seen
him
we
will
give
him
some
alms
when
he
goes
what
an
original
country
this
is
what
types
and
how
interesting
his
chase
after
that
civil
guard
all
over
spain
with
this
material
one
might
write
a
most
delightful
feuilleton
the
farm
women
were
taking
the
great
off
the
fire
which
spread
the
most
excellent
smell
of
pork
sausages
to
breakfast
caballeros
shouted
el
nacional
who
took
upon
himself
the
functions
of
majordomo
when
he
was
at
the
matador
farm
in
the
centre
of
the
kitchen
stood
a
large
table
spread
with
cloths
round
loaves
and
bottles
of
wine
potaje
and
plumitas
arrived
at
the
summons
and
various
employés
of
the
farm
the
steward
the
overseer
and
all
those
fulfilling
the
more
confidential
functions
they
proceeded
to
sit
down
on
two
benches
placed
alongside
the
table
while
gallardo
looked
undecidedly
at
doña
sol
she
ought
to
breakfast
upstairs
in
the
family
rooms
but
the
lady
laughing
at
this
invitation
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
she
enjoyed
this
rustic
life
and
she
thought
it
very
interesting
to
breakfast
with
these
people
she
had
been
born
for
a
soldier
with
masculine
free
and
easiness
she
made
the
espada
sit
down
sniffing
the
delicious
smell
of
the
sausages
with
her
pretty
nose
what
a
delicious
meal
how
hungry
she
was
this
is
all
right
said
plumitas
sententiously
as
he
looked
at
the
table
the
masters
and
the
servants
eating
together
as
they
are
said
to
have
done
in
ancient
times
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
it
he
sat
down
by
the
picador
still
holding
his
carbine
which
he
placed
between
his
knees
get
along
further
up
my
lad
said
he
pushing
potaje
with
his
body
the
picador
who
treated
him
with
rough
comradeship
replied
by
another
push
and
the
two
men
laughed
as
they
pushed
each
other
amusing
the
whole
table
with
their
rough
horseplay
but
curse
you
said
the
picador
put
your
gun
away
from
between
your
knees
do
you
see
it
is
pointing
at
me
and
an
accident
might
happen
certainly
the
bandit
carbine
standing
between
his
legs
was
pointing
its
black
muzzle
towards
the
picador
put
it
down
man
insisted
the
latter
do
you
want
it
to
eat
with
it
is
all
right
as
it
is
there
is
no
fear
replied
the
bandit
shortly
frowning
as
if
he
would
not
admit
of
any
remark
as
to
his
precautions
he
seized
a
spoon
took
a
large
piece
of
bread
and
looked
round
at
the
others
to
make
sure
with
his
rural
courtesy
if
the
proper
time
for
beginning
had
arrived
your
health
señores
and
without
more
ado
he
attacked
the
enormous
dish
which
had
been
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
for
him
and
the
toreros
another
equally
large
dish
smoked
further
down
for
the
farm
people
he
soon
seemed
ashamed
of
his
voracity
and
after
a
few
spoonsful
stopped
thinking
an
explanation
necessary
since
yesterday
morning
i
have
touched
nothing
but
a
scrap
of
bread
and
a
drop
of
milk
which
they
gave
me
in
a
shepherd
hut
good
appetite
gentlemen
and
he
again
attacked
the
dish
acknowledging
potaje
jests
as
to
his
voracity
by
winking
and
the
continued
working
of
his
jaws
the
picador
wished
to
make
him
drink
intimidated
by
his
presence
who
was
afraid
of
his
drunkenness
he
looked
anxiously
at
the
flasks
of
wine
placed
within
reach
of
his
hand
drink
plumitas
dry
food
is
bad
you
must
wet
it
but
before
the
brigand
could
accept
his
invitation
potaje
drank
and
drank
again
hurriedly
plumitas
only
now
and
then
touched
his
glass
and
even
then
with
great
hesitation
he
was
afraid
of
wine
and
also
he
had
lost
the
habit
of
drinking
it
in
the
country
he
could
not
always
get
it
besides
wine
was
the
worst
enemy
for
a
man
like
himself
who
had
to
live
constantly
wide
awake
and
on
guard
but
you
are
here
among
friends
said
the
picador
think
plumitas
that
you
are
in
seville
beneath
the
very
mantle
of
the
virgin
de
la
macarena
no
one
would
touch
you
here
and
if
by
any
unlucky
chance
the
civil
guards
did
come
i
should
place
myself
by
your
side
seizing
a
garrocha
and
we
would
not
leave
one
of
the
blackguards
alive
it
would
take
very
little
to
make
me
a
rider
of
the
mountain
that
has
always
attracted
me
potaje
roared
the
espada
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
fearing
his
loquacity
and
his
propinquity
to
the
bottles
although
the
bandit
drank
little
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
he
had
chosen
his
seat
opposite
the
kitchen
door
a
place
from
which
he
enfiladed
the
entrance
of
the
grange
seeing
also
part
of
the
lonely
road
now
and
again
a
cow
or
a
pig
or
a
goat
would
cross
over
the
strip
of
road
their
shadows
projected
by
the
sun
in
front
of
them
this
was
quite
enough
to
startle
plumitas
who
would
drop
his
spoon
and
clutch
his
rifle
he
talked
with
his
neighbours
at
table
without
ever
diverting
his
attention
from
outside
with
the
habit
of
always
living
ready
at
any
time
for
resistance
or
flight
feeling
it
a
point
of
honour
never
to
be
surprised
when
he
had
done
eating
he
accepted
another
glass
from
potaje
the
last
and
remained
with
his
chin
on
his
hand
looking
out
silently
and
sleepily
gallardo
offered
him
an
havana
cigar
thanks
seño
juan
i
do
not
smoke
but
i
will
keep
it
for
a
companion
of
mine
who
is
also
out
on
the
mountain
a
poor
fellow
who
appreciates
a
smoke
even
more
than
food
he
is
a
young
fellow
who
had
a
misfortune
and
who
now
helps
me
when
there
is
work
for
two
he
put
the
cigar
away
under
his
jacket
and
the
remembrance
of
that
companion
who
at
that
time
was
certainly
wandering
not
very
far
off
made
him
smile
with
ferocious
glee
the
wine
had
warmed
plumitas
and
his
face
had
become
quite
different
his
eyes
had
an
alarming
metallic
lustre
and
his
chubby
face
was
contracted
by
a
spasm
which
seemed
to
alter
his
usual
expression
one
could
guess
also
a
desire
to
talk
to
boast
of
his
exploits
to
repay
the
hospitality
received
by
astonishing
his
benefactors
have
any
of
you
heard
what
i
did
last
month
on
the
road
to
fregenal
do
you
really
know
nothing
about
it
i
placed
myself
on
the
road
with
my
companion
because
we
had
to
stop
the
diligence
and
settle
with
a
rich
man
who
remembered
me
every
hour
of
his
life
an
important
man
that
accustomed
to
move
alcaldes
officials
and
even
civil
guards
at
his
will
what
they
call
in
the
papers
a
cacique
i
had
sent
him
a
message
asking
for
a
hundred
duros
for
an
emergency
which
made
him
write
to
the
governor
of
seville
and
start
a
scandal
even
in
madrid
making
them
persecute
me
more
than
ever
thanks
to
him
i
had
a
brush
with
the
civiles
in
which
i
got
wounded
in
the
leg
and
not
content
with
this
they
put
my
wife
in
prison
as
if
the
poor
woman
could
know
her
husband
doings
that
judas
did
not
dare
to
leave
his
village
for
fear
of
meeting
plumitas
but
just
at
that
time
i
disappeared
i
went
on
one
of
those
journeys
i
told
you
about
and
our
man
gained
confidence
enough
to
go
to
seville
one
day
on
business
and
to
set
the
authorities
on
me
so
we
waited
for
the
return
coach
from
seville
and
the
coach
arrived
the
companion
who
is
a
very
good
hand
for
anything
on
the
road
cried
to
the
driver
i
put
my
head
and
my
carbine
in
through
the
doorway
there
were
screams
from
the
women
yells
from
the
children
and
the
men
who
said
nothing
were
as
white
as
wax
i
said
to
the
travellers
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
calm
yourselves
ladies
your
good
health
gentlemen
and
pleasant
journey
but
make
that
fat
man
get
out
and
our
man
who
had
hidden
himself
among
the
petticoats
had
to
get
out
as
pale
as
death
looking
bloodless
and
staggering
as
though
he
were
drunk
the
coach
drove
off
and
we
remained
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
road
here
i
am
el
plumitas
and
i
am
going
to
give
you
something
to
remember
me
by
and
i
gave
it
but
i
did
not
kill
him
at
once
i
gave
it
to
him
in
a
certain
place
i
know
so
that
he
should
live
hours
and
that
he
should
be
able
to
tell
the
civiles
when
they
picked
him
up
that
it
was
plumitas
who
had
killed
him
so
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
and
no
one
else
should
take
the
credit
doña
sol
listened
intensely
pale
with
her
lips
compressed
by
terror
and
in
her
eyes
that
strange
light
which
always
accompanied
her
mysterious
thoughts
gallardo
frowned
annoyed
by
this
ferocious
story
every
one
knows
his
own
business
seño
juan
plumitas
continued
as
if
he
guessed
the
matador
thoughts
we
both
live
by
killing
you
kill
bulls
i
kill
men
the
only
difference
is
that
you
are
rich
and
carry
off
the
palm
and
the
beautiful
women
and
i
often
rage
with
hunger
and
if
i
am
careless
i
shall
be
riddled
with
shot
and
left
in
the
middle
of
a
field
for
the
crows
to
pick
but
all
the
same
the
business
does
not
please
me
seño
juan
you
know
exactly
where
you
have
to
strike
the
bull
for
him
to
fall
to
the
ground
at
once
i
also
know
exactly
where
to
hit
a
christian
so
that
he
shall
die
at
once
or
that
he
should
last
a
little
or
that
he
should
spend
weeks
raging
against
plumitas
who
wishes
to
interfere
with
no
one
but
who
knows
how
to
treat
those
who
interfere
with
him
doña
sol
again
felt
an
intense
desire
to
know
the
number
of
his
crimes
you
will
feel
repugnance
towards
me
señora
marquesa
but
after
all
what
does
it
matter
i
do
not
think
i
can
remember
them
all
although
i
try
to
recall
them
possibly
they
might
be
or
i
really
could
not
quite
say
in
this
very
restless
life
who
thinks
of
keeping
exact
accounts
but
i
am
an
unhappy
man
señora
marquesa
very
unfortunate
the
fault
lay
with
those
who
first
harmed
me
these
dead
men
are
like
cherries
if
you
pull
one
the
others
come
down
by
dozens
i
have
to
kill
in
order
to
go
on
living
and
if
ever
one
feels
any
pity
one
has
to
swallow
it
there
was
a
long
silence
the
lady
looked
at
the
bandit
coarse
strong
hands
with
their
broken
nails
but
plumitas
took
no
notice
of
her
all
his
attention
was
fixed
on
the
espada
wishing
to
show
his
gratitude
for
having
been
received
at
his
table
and
anxious
to
dispel
the
impression
that
his
words
seemed
to
have
caused
i
respect
you
seño
juan
he
added
ever
since
i
saw
you
fight
for
the
first
time
i
said
to
myself
is
a
brave
fellow
there
are
many
aficionados
who
love
you
but
not
as
i
do
just
imagine
that
to
see
you
i
have
often
disguised
myself
and
have
gone
into
the
towns
exposing
myself
to
the
risk
of
anyone
laying
hands
on
me
is
that
love
of
sport
gallardo
smiled
nodding
his
head
he
was
flattered
now
in
his
artistic
pride
besides
continued
the
bandit
no
one
can
say
that
i
ever
came
to
la
rincona
even
to
ask
for
a
bit
of
bread
many
a
time
i
have
been
starving
or
have
wanted
five
duros
when
i
was
passing
by
here
but
never
till
have
i
passed
through
the
fence
of
your
farm
i
have
always
said
juan
is
sacred
to
me
he
earns
his
money
by
risking
his
life
just
as
i
do
we
are
in
a
way
comrades
because
you
will
not
deny
seño
juan
that
although
you
are
a
personage
and
that
i
am
of
the
very
worst
still
we
are
equal
as
we
both
live
by
playing
with
death
now
we
are
breakfasting
together
quietly
but
some
day
if
god
looses
his
hand
from
us
and
becomes
tired
of
us
i
shall
be
picked
up
from
the
side
of
the
road
shot
like
a
dog
and
you
with
all
your
money
may
be
carried
out
of
the
arena
feet
foremost
and
though
the
papers
may
speak
of
your
misfortune
for
a
month
or
so
it
is
cursed
little
gratitude
you
will
feel
towards
them
when
you
are
in
another
world
it
is
true
it
is
true
said
gallardo
suddenly
paling
at
the
bandit
words
the
superstitious
terror
that
always
seized
upon
him
as
the
time
of
danger
approached
was
reflected
in
his
face
his
probable
fate
seemed
to
him
just
the
same
as
that
of
this
terrible
vagabond
who
must
one
day
necessarily
succumb
in
his
unequal
strife
but
do
you
believe
that
i
think
of
death
no
i
repent
of
nothing
and
i
go
on
my
way
i
also
have
my
pleasures
and
my
little
prides
just
the
same
as
you
when
you
read
in
the
papers
that
you
did
very
well
with
a
certain
bull
and
were
given
the
ear
just
think
that
all
spain
talks
of
el
plumitas
that
the
papers
tell
the
biggest
lies
about
me
they
even
say
they
are
going
to
exhibit
me
at
the
theatres
and
in
that
place
in
madrid
where
the
deputies
meet
they
talk
daily
of
my
capture
over
and
above
this
i
have
the
pride
of
seeing
a
whole
army
tracking
my
footsteps
to
see
myself
a
man
alone
driving
thousands
mad
who
are
paid
by
government
and
wear
a
sword
the
other
day
a
sunday
i
rode
into
a
village
during
mass
and
drew
up
my
mare
in
the
plaza
close
to
some
blind
men
who
were
singing
and
playing
the
guitar
the
people
were
lost
in
admiration
before
a
cartoon
carried
by
the
singers
which
represented
a
fine
looking
man
with
whiskers
in
a
pointed
hat
splendidly
dressed
and
riding
a
magnificent
horse
with
a
gun
across
the
saddle
bow
and
a
good
looking
girl
en
croupe
behind
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
realised
that
that
good
looking
fellow
was
plumitas
that
did
please
me
when
one
goes
about
ragged
and
half
starving
it
is
delightful
that
people
should
imagine
you
something
quite
different
i
bought
the
paper
they
were
singing
from
i
have
got
it
here
the
complete
life
of
plumitas
with
many
lies
all
in
verse
but
it
is
a
fine
thing
when
i
lie
on
the
i
read
it
so
as
to
learn
it
by
heart
it
must
have
been
written
by
some
very
clever
man
the
terrible
plumitas
showed
an
almost
childish
pride
in
speaking
of
his
fame
the
modest
silence
with
which
he
had
entered
the
farm
had
vanished
that
desire
that
they
should
forget
his
personality
and
see
in
him
only
a
poor
wayfarer
pressed
by
hunger
he
warmed
at
the
thought
that
his
name
was
famous
and
that
his
deeds
received
at
once
the
honours
of
publicity
who
would
have
known
me
he
continued
had
i
gone
on
living
in
my
village
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
that
for
us
of
the
lower
orders
nothing
is
open
but
to
eat
one
heart
out
working
for
others
or
to
follow
the
only
career
which
gives
fame
and
money
killing
i
should
be
no
good
at
killing
bulls
my
village
is
in
the
mountains
where
there
are
no
fierce
cattle
besides
i
am
heavy
and
not
very
clever
so
i
kill
people
it
is
the
best
thing
a
poor
man
can
do
to
make
himself
respected
and
open
a
way
for
himself
el
nacional
who
up
to
now
had
been
gravely
listening
to
the
bandit
thought
it
necessary
to
intervene
what
a
poor
man
wants
is
education
to
know
how
to
read
and
write
this
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
laughter
by
all
who
knew
el
mania
now
you
have
given
us
your
ideas
comrade
said
potaje
let
plumitas
go
on
with
his
stories
what
he
is
telling
us
is
capital
the
bandit
received
the
banderillero
remarks
contemptuously
indeed
he
thought
very
little
of
him
owing
to
his
prudence
in
the
circus
i
know
how
to
read
and
write
and
what
good
has
it
done
me
when
i
lived
in
my
village
it
was
useful
to
get
me
noticed
and
to
make
life
seem
a
little
less
hard
what
a
poor
man
wants
is
justice
that
he
may
have
his
rights
but
if
they
are
not
given
then
let
him
take
them
one
must
be
a
wolf
and
spread
fear
the
other
wolves
will
respect
you
and
the
herds
will
let
themselves
be
devoured
with
pleasure
if
they
find
you
cowardly
and
without
strength
even
the
sheep
will
spit
on
you
potaje
who
was
now
very
drunk
assented
delightedly
he
did
not
exactly
understand
still
through
the
mists
of
drink
he
seemed
to
perceive
the
brilliancy
of
supreme
wisdom
that
is
true
comrade
go
on
capital
i
have
seen
what
the
world
is
continued
the
bandit
the
world
is
divided
into
two
classes
the
shorn
and
the
shearers
i
do
not
wish
to
be
shorn
i
was
born
to
be
a
shearer
because
i
am
a
man
who
fears
nothing
the
same
thing
has
happened
to
you
seño
juan
by
struggling
we
have
risen
from
the
low
herd
but
your
path
is
better
than
mine
he
was
silent
for
some
time
considering
the
espada
at
last
he
went
on
in
a
tone
of
conviction
i
believe
seño
juan
that
we
have
come
into
the
world
too
late
what
things
men
of
valour
and
enterprise
like
ourselves
might
have
done
in
former
days
you
would
not
have
been
killing
bulls
neither
should
i
be
wandering
over
the
country
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
we
might
have
been
viceroys
archipampanos
or
something
great
across
the
seas
have
you
never
heard
of
pizarro
seño
juan
señor
juan
made
an
indefinable
gesture
as
he
did
not
wish
to
admit
his
ignorance
of
this
name
which
he
now
heard
for
the
first
time
the
señora
marquesa
knows
all
about
him
i
learnt
his
history
when
i
was
a
sacristan
and
read
the
old
romances
that
the
priest
had
well
pizarro
was
a
poor
man
like
us
who
crossed
the
sea
with
twelve
or
thirteen
gachos
as
good
fighters
as
himself
and
entered
a
country
that
must
have
been
a
real
paradise
a
country
in
which
were
the
mines
of
potosi
i
ca
say
more
they
fought
many
battles
with
the
inhabitants
and
at
last
conquered
them
seizing
their
king
treasures
and
he
who
got
least
got
his
house
full
up
to
the
roof
with
gold
pieces
and
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
was
not
made
a
marquis
or
a
general
or
a
justiciary
just
imagine
seño
juan
if
we
had
lived
then
what
you
and
i
could
have
done
with
a
handful
of
brave
men
like
these
who
are
listening
to
me
the
farm
men
listened
in
silence
but
their
eyes
flashed
as
the
bandit
spoke
i
repeat
we
have
been
born
too
late
seño
juan
the
gates
are
closed
to
poor
men
the
spaniard
does
not
now
know
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
all
the
places
where
he
might
have
spread
have
been
appropriated
by
the
english
or
other
countries
i
who
might
have
been
a
king
in
america
or
elsewhere
am
proclaimed
an
outlaw
and
they
even
call
me
a
thief
you
who
are
a
brave
man
kill
bulls
and
carry
off
the
palms
still
i
know
many
who
look
upon
a
torero
profession
as
a
low
one
doña
sol
interrupted
to
ask
the
bandit
why
he
did
not
become
a
soldier
he
could
go
to
distant
countries
where
there
were
wars
and
utilize
his
talents
nobly
i
might
have
done
so
señora
marquesa
i
have
often
thought
of
it
but
when
i
sleep
at
a
farm
or
hide
in
my
house
for
a
few
days
the
first
time
i
lie
in
a
bed
like
a
christian
or
have
a
hot
meal
at
a
table
like
this
a
feeling
of
comfort
pervades
my
body
but
in
a
short
time
i
get
restless
it
seems
as
if
the
mountain
with
all
its
miseries
draws
me
and
i
long
once
more
to
sleep
on
the
ground
wrapped
in
my
blanket
with
a
stone
for
my
pillow
yes
i
might
have
been
a
soldier
and
i
should
have
been
a
good
one
but
where
to
go
besides
the
same
things
happen
over
again
in
the
army
as
in
the
world
the
shorn
and
the
shearers
you
do
some
great
thing
and
the
colonel
appropriates
it
or
you
fight
like
a
wild
beast
and
the
general
is
rewarded
no
i
have
been
born
too
late
to
be
a
soldier
plumitas
remained
some
time
silent
with
lowered
eyes
as
if
he
were
absorbed
in
the
mental
contemplation
of
his
misfortune
at
finding
no
place
for
himself
in
the
present
age
suddenly
he
stood
up
grasping
his
carbine
i
am
going
many
thanks
seño
juan
for
your
kindness
señora
marquesa
but
where
are
you
going
said
potaje
catching
hold
of
him
sit
down
you
are
better
here
than
anywhere
else
the
picador
wanted
to
prolong
the
bandit
stay
delighted
to
think
he
should
be
able
to
describe
this
interesting
meeting
in
the
town
i
have
been
here
three
hours
and
i
must
go
i
never
spend
so
long
a
time
in
so
open
and
unconcealed
a
place
as
la
rinconada
possibly
by
now
some
one
has
carried
the
news
that
i
am
here
are
you
afraid
of
the
civiles
enquired
potaje
they
will
not
come
or
if
they
do
i
am
at
your
side
plumitas
made
a
contemptuous
gesture
the
civiles
they
are
men
like
any
others
some
of
them
brave
enough
but
they
are
all
fathers
of
families
and
would
manage
not
to
see
him
they
only
came
out
against
him
when
chance
brought
them
face
to
face
and
there
was
no
means
of
avoiding
it
last
month
i
was
at
the
farm
of
five
chimnies
breaking
fast
as
i
am
here
though
not
in
such
good
company
when
i
saw
six
civiles
on
foot
coming
i
am
quite
sure
they
did
not
know
i
was
there
and
only
came
for
refreshment
it
was
an
unlucky
chance
for
neither
they
nor
i
could
turn
tail
in
the
presence
of
all
the
farm
people
the
owner
locked
the
gates
and
the
civiles
began
to
knock
for
them
to
be
opened
i
ordered
him
and
a
shepherd
to
stand
by
the
two
leaves
of
the
door
i
say
now
open
them
wide
i
mounted
my
mare
with
my
revolver
in
my
hand
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
i
galloped
out
like
the
devil
they
fired
two
or
three
shots
but
did
not
touch
me
i
also
fired
as
i
went
out
and
i
understand
wounded
two
of
the
civiles
to
cut
it
short
i
fled
lying
on
the
mare
neck
so
that
they
should
not
make
a
target
of
me
and
the
civiles
revenged
themselves
by
thrashing
the
farm
servants
for
which
reason
seño
juan
it
is
best
to
say
nothing
about
my
visits
for
if
you
do
down
come
the
three
cornered
hats
sickening
you
with
enquiries
and
declarations
as
if
they
were
going
to
catch
me
with
those
those
of
la
rinconada
assented
mutely
they
knew
it
well
enough
they
must
hold
their
tongues
to
avoid
annoyances
as
they
did
in
all
the
other
farms
or
shepherd
ranches
this
general
silence
was
the
most
powerful
auxiliary
besides
all
these
country
peasants
were
admirers
of
plumitas
looking
on
him
as
an
avenging
hero
they
need
fear
no
harm
from
him
his
menaces
only
touched
the
rich
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
civiles
continued
the
bandit
those
i
fear
are
the
poor
the
poor
are
good
but
poverty
is
such
an
ugly
thing
i
know
that
those
three
cornered
hats
will
not
kill
me
they
have
no
balls
that
can
touch
me
if
anyone
kills
me
it
will
be
one
of
the
poor
i
let
them
approach
without
fear
because
they
belong
to
my
own
class
but
some
day
advantage
will
be
taken
of
my
carelessness
i
have
enemies
people
who
have
sworn
vengeance
on
me
for
one
must
have
a
heavy
hand
if
one
would
be
respected
if
one
kills
a
man
outright
his
family
remain
to
avenge
him
but
if
one
is
good
natured
and
contents
oneself
with
taking
down
his
trousers
and
caressing
him
with
a
bunch
of
nettles
and
thistles
he
remembers
the
jest
all
his
life
it
is
the
poor
those
of
my
own
class
that
i
fear
besides
in
every
village
there
is
some
fine
fellow
who
thinks
he
would
like
to
be
my
heir
and
hopes
to
find
me
some
day
sleeping
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
and
will
blow
off
my
head
point
blank
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
plumitas
came
out
of
the
stable
into
the
courtyard
mounted
on
his
powerful
mare
the
inseparable
companion
of
his
wanderings
the
bony
animal
looked
bigger
and
brighter
for
her
brief
hours
of
plenty
in
the
rinconada
mangers
plumitas
caressed
her
flanks
pausing
as
he
arranged
his
blanket
on
the
she
might
indeed
be
content
she
would
not
often
be
so
well
treated
as
at
señor
juan
gallardo
farm
and
now
she
must
carry
herself
well
for
the
day
would
be
long
and
whither
are
you
going
comrade
asked
potaje
do
ask
me
throughout
the
world
i
myself
do
not
know
where
anything
turns
up
and
putting
a
foot
in
his
rusty
and
muddy
stirrup
with
one
bound
he
sat
erect
in
his
saddle
gallardo
left
doña
sol
side
who
was
watching
the
preparations
for
departure
with
strange
eyes
her
lips
pale
and
drawn
the
torero
searched
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
and
advancing
towards
the
rider
offered
him
shamefacedly
some
crumpled
papers
that
he
held
in
his
hand
what
is
this
said
the
bandit
money
thanks
seño
juan
some
one
has
told
you
that
it
is
necessary
to
give
me
something
when
i
come
to
a
farm
but
that
is
for
those
others
the
rich
whose
money
grows
like
the
roses
you
earn
yours
by
risking
your
life
we
are
companions
keep
it
yourself
seño
juan
señor
juan
kept
his
bank
notes
though
rather
annoyed
by
the
refusal
and
his
persistence
in
treating
him
as
a
comrade
you
shall
pledge
me
a
bull
some
time
or
other
when
we
see
each
other
in
a
plaza
that
would
be
worth
more
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
doña
sol
now
came
forward
till
she
was
quite
close
to
the
rider
foot
and
taking
from
her
breast
an
autumn
rose
she
offered
it
silently
looking
at
him
with
her
green
and
golden
eyes
is
this
for
me
said
the
bandit
surprised
and
wondering
for
me
señora
marquesa
as
she
nodded
her
head
he
took
the
flower
shyly
handling
it
awkwardly
as
if
its
weight
were
overpowering
not
knowing
where
to
place
it
till
at
last
he
passed
it
through
a
in
his
jacket
between
the
two
ends
of
the
red
handkerchief
he
wore
tied
round
his
neck
this
is
good
indeed
his
broad
face
expanding
into
a
smile
nothing
of
the
sort
has
ever
happened
to
me
before
in
my
life
the
rough
rider
seemed
moved
and
troubled
by
the
womanliness
of
the
gift
roses
for
him
he
gathered
up
his
reins
to
you
all
caballeros
till
we
meet
again
my
fine
fellows
some
time
or
other
i
will
throw
you
a
cigar
if
you
plant
a
good
lance
he
gave
a
rough
clasp
of
the
hand
to
the
picador
who
replied
by
a
thump
on
the
thigh
which
made
the
bandit
vigorous
muscles
jump
that
plumitas
how
simpatico
he
was
potaje
in
his
drunken
tenderness
would
have
liked
to
go
with
him
to
the
mountain
adio
adio
and
spurring
his
horse
he
rode
out
of
the
courtyard
gallardo
seemed
relieved
on
seeing
him
depart
he
turned
towards
doña
sol
she
was
standing
motionless
following
the
rider
with
her
eyes
as
he
grew
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
what
a
woman
murmured
the
espada
sadly
what
a
woman
it
was
fortunate
that
plumitas
was
ugly
and
was
dirty
and
ragged
as
a
vagabond
otherwise
she
would
have

it

impossible
sebastian
that
a
man
like
you
with
a
wife
and
children
should
have
lent
yourself
to
this
debauchery
i
who
believed
you
so
different
and
who
had
such
confidence
in
you
when
you
went
on

with

who
felt
quite
at

that
he
went
with
a
man
of
good

where
is
all
your
talk
about

is
this
what
you
learn
at

in

the

terrified
by
the
indignation
of

by

was
silently
weeping

face
hidden
behind

defended

in
peace
as
he
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
by
the
life
of
the
blue
dove
i
went
to
la
rincona
because
my
master
ordered
me
you
know
well
enough
what
a
cuadrilla
is
it
is
just
the
same
as
an
army
discipline
and
obedience
the
matador
orders
and
we
have
to
obey
as
all
this
about
the
bulls
dates
from
the
time
of
the
inquisition
there
is
no
profession
more
reactionary
imposter
screamed
señora
angustias
you
are
fine
with
all
these
fables
about
the
inquisition
and
reaction
between
you
all
you
are
killing
this
poor
child
who
spends
her
days
weeping
like
la
dolorosa
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
hide
my
son
debauchery
because
he
feeds
you
you
have
said
it
seña
angustias
juaniyo
feeds
me
so
it
is
and
as
he
feeds
me
i
must
obey
him
but
look
here
señora
put
yourself
in
my
place
if
my
matador
tells
me
i
am
to
go
to
la
rincona
all
right
if
at
the
time
of
our
departure
i
find
a
very
pretty
woman
in
the
automobile
what
am
i
to
do
the
matador
orders
besides
i
did
not
go
alone
potaje
also
went
and
he
is
a
person
of
a
certain
age
and
respectability
even
though
he
is
rough
but
he
never
laughs
the
torero
mother
was
furious
at
this
excuse
potaje
a
bad
man
whom
juaniyo
would
not
have
in
his
cuadrilla
if
he
had
any
shame
do
speak
to
me
of
that
drunkard
who
beats
his
wife
and
starves
his
children
all
right
we
leave
potaje
out
i
say
when
i
saw
that
great
lady
what
was
i
to
do
she
is
the
marquis
niece
and
you
know
that
toreros
have
to
stand
well
with
people
of
rank
if
they
can
they
have
to
live
on
the
public
and
what
harm
was
there
and
then
at
the
farm
there
was
nothing
i
swear
it
by
my
own
do
you
think
i
should
have
countenanced
this
dishonour
even
if
my
matador
had
ordered
me
i
am
a
decent
man
seña
angustias
and
you
do
wrong
to
call
me
the
bad
names
you
did
just
now
i
repeat
there
was
nothing
they
spoke
to
each
other
just
as
you
and
i
do
there
was
not
an
evil
look
or
word
each
spent
the
night
on
their
own
side
there
was
decency
at
all
times
and
if
you
wish
for
potaje
to
come
he
will
tell
you
but
carmen
interrupted
in
a
tearful
voice
cut
by
sobs
in
my
house
she
said
with
a
dazed
expression
at
the
farm
and
she
slept
in
my
bed
i
knew
it
all
too
and
i
held
my
tongue
i
held
my
tongue
but
this
jesus
this
there
is
not
a
man
in
seville
who
would
have
dared
so
much
el
nacional
interposed
kindly
calm
yourself
señora
carmen
it
certainly
is
of
no
importance
only
the
visit
of
a
lady
to
the
farm
who
is
enthusiastic
about
the
maestro
and
wished
to
see
how
he
lived
in
the
country
these
ladies
who
are
half
foreign
are
very
capricious
and
strange
but
if
you
had
only
seen
the
french
ladies
when
the
cuadrilla
went
to
fight
at
nîmes
and
arles
the
sum
total
is
nothing
at
all
altogether
rubbish
by
the
blue
dove
i
should
like
to
know
the
babbler
who
brought
the
gossip
if
i
were
juaniyo
if
it
were
anyone
belonging
to
the
farm
i
should
turn
him
out
and
if
it
were
anyone
outside
i
would
have
him
up
before
the
judge
and
put
in
prison
as
a
calumniator
and
an
enemy
carmen
still
wept
as
she
listened
to
the
banderillero
indignation
but
señora
angustias
seated
in
an
which
scarcely
contained
her
overflowing
person
frowned
and
pursed
up
her
hairy
and
wrinkled
mouth
hold
your
tongue
sebastian
and
do
tell
lies
cried
the
old
woman
that
journey
to
the
farm
was
an
indecent
orgy
a
fiesta
of
gipsies
they
even
say
plumitas
the
brigand
was
with
you
el
nacional
fairly
jumped
with
surprise
and
anxiety
he
thought
he
saw
coming
into
the
patio
trampling
the
marble
pavement
a
rider
dirty
ragged
with
a
greasy
sombrero
who
got
off
his
horse
and
pointed
his
rifle
at
him
as
a
coward
and
informer
and
immediately
after
him
followed
many
civil
guards
in
shining
hats
whiskered
and
enquiring
writing
down
notes
and
then
all
the
cuadrilla
in
their
gala
dresses
roped
together
on
their
way
to
prison
most
certainly
he
must
deny
it
all
energetically
rubbish
all
rubbish
what
are
you
talking
about
plumitas
there
was
nothing
but
decency
god
alive
they
will
be
saying
next
that
i
a
good
citizen
who
can
carry
a
hundred
votes
from
my
suburb
to
the
urns
am
a
friend
of
plumitas
señora
angustias
who
was
not
quite
sure
about
this
last
piece
of
news
seemed
convinced
by
el
nacional
asseverations
all
right
she
would
say
nothing
more
about
el
plumitas
but
as
for
the
other
thing
the
journey
to
the
farm
with
that
female
and
firm
in
her
blindness
which
made
the
responsibility
for
all
the
espada
acts
fall
on
his
companions
she
continued
pouring
blame
on
el
nacional
i
shall
tell
your
wife
what
you
are
poor
thing
working
herself
to
death
in
her
shop
from
dawn
till
dark
while
you
go
to
that
orgy
like
a
reprobate
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
at
your
age
and
with
all
those
brats
the
banderillero
fairly
fled
before
the
wrath
of
señora
angustias
who
moved
by
her
great
indignation
developed
the
same
nimbleness
of
tongue
as
in
the
days
when
she
was
at
the
tobacco
factory
he
vowed
he
would
never
again
return
to
his
master
house
he
met
gallardo
in
the
street
the
latter
seemed
out
of
temper
but
pretended
to
be
bright
and
smiling
when
he
saw
the
banderillero
as
if
he
were
in
no
way
troubled
by
his
domestic
dissensions
all
this
is
very
bad
juaniyo
i
will
never
return
to
your
house
even
if
i
am
dragged
there
your
mother
insults
me
as
if
i
were
a
gipsy
of
triana
your
wife
weeps
and
looks
at
me
as
if
all
the
fault
were
mine
man
alive
do
me
the
pleasure
not
to
remember
me
next
time
choose
some
other
of
your
associates
another
time
if
you
take
ladies
gallardo
smiled
well
pleased
it
would
be
nothing
at
all
these
things
passed
off
quickly
he
had
often
faced
worse
troubles
what
you
ought
to
do
is
to
come
to
the
house
when
there
are
many
people
there
there
can
be
no
rows
i
exclaimed
el
nacional
i
will
be
a
priest
first
after
this
the
espada
thought
it
was
no
use
insisting
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
out
of
the
home
away
from
the
women
morose
silence
interrupted
by
floods
of
tears
and
when
he
returned
it
was
with
an
escort
availing
himself
of
his
manager
and
other
friends
the
saddler
was
a
great
help
to
gallardo
who
for
the
first
time
began
to
think
his
simpatico
remarkable
for
his
good
sense
and
worthy
of
a
better
fate
he
it
was
who
during
the
absence
undertook
to
pacify
the
women
including
his
own
wife
leaving
them
like
exhausted
furies
let
us
see
he
said
what
is
it
all
about
a
woman
of
no
importance
every
one
is
as
he
is
and
juaniyo
is
a
personage
who
must
mix
with
influential
people
and
if
this
lady
did
go
to
the
farm
what
then
one
must
cultivate
good
friendships
for
in
that
way
one
can
ask
favours
and
help
on
one
family
there
was
nothing
wrong
it
was
all
calumny
el
nacional
was
there
who
is
a
man
of
good
character
i
know
him
very
well
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
praised
the
banderillero
being
constantly
in
the
house
he
was
a
valuable
auxiliary
to
gallardo
and
the
torero
was
not
niggardly
in
his
gratitude
the
saddler
had
closed
his
shop
as
trade
was
bad
and
was
waiting
for
some
employment
through
his
in
the
meanwhile
the
torero
supplied
all
the
wants
of
the
family
and
finally
invited
them
all
to
take
up
their
quarters
permanently
in
his
house
in
this
way
poor
carmen
would
worry
less
not
being
so
much
alone
one
day
el
nacional
received
a
message
from
his
matador
wife
that
she
wished
to
see
him
the
banderillero
own
wife
delivered
the
message
i
saw
her
this
morning
she
came
from
san
gil
the
poor
thing
eyes
looked
as
though
she
were
constantly
crying
go
and
see
her
ay
those
handsome
men
what
a
curse
they
are
carmen
received
el
nacional
in
the
matador
study
they
would
be
alone
there
and
there
would
be
no
fear
of
señora
angustias
coming
in
with
her
vehemence
gallardo
was
at
the
club
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
he
was
away
from
the
house
most
days
to
avoid
meeting
his
wife
he
even
had
his
meals
out
going
with
some
friends
to
the
inn
at
eritana
el
nacional
sat
on
a
divan
with
his
head
bent
twirling
his
hat
in
his
hands
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
his
master
wife
how
she
was
altered
her
eyes
were
red
and
surrounded
by
black
hollows
her
dark
cheeks
and
the
end
of
her
nose
were
also
reddened
from
the
constant
rubbing
of
her
handkerchief
sebastian
you
will
tell
me
the
whole
truth
you
are
kind
and
you
are
juan
best
friend
all
the
little
mother
said
the
other
day
was
temper
you
know
how
really
good
she
is
it
was
only
an
outburst
over
directly
pay
no
attention
to
it
the
banderillero
nodded
assent
and
then
hazarded
the
question
what
did
señora
carmen
wish
to
know
you
must
tell
me
all
that
happened
at
la
rincona
all
you
saw
and
all
you
fancied
ah
good
nacional
with
what
noble
pride
he
raised
his
head
pleased
at
being
able
to
do
good
and
give
comfort
to
that
unhappy
woman
see
he
had
seen
nothing
wrong
i
swear
it
to
you
by
my
father
i
swear
it
by
my
ideas
he
supported
his
oath
without
fear
by
the
sacrosanct
testimony
of
his
ideas
for
in
fact
he
had
seen
nothing
and
having
seen
nothing
he
reasoned
logically
in
the
pride
of
his
perspicuity
and
wisdom
that
nothing
wrong
could
have
occurred
i
think
they
are
nothing
more
than
friends
now
if
there
has
been
anything
before
i
know
not
the
people
here
talk
they
invent
so
many
lies
but
pay
no
attention
señora
carmen
live
happily
that
is
the
best
thing
but
she
insisted
what
had
happened
at
the
farm
the
grange
was
her
home
and
she
was
indignant
as
joined
to
the
infidelity
this
seemed
to
her
a
sacrilege
a
direct
insult
to
herself
do
you
think
me
a
fool
sebastian
i
have
seen
it
all
along
from
the
first
moment
he
began
to
think
of
that
lady
or
whatever
she
is
i
have
known
what
juan
was
thinking
the
day
he
pledged
the
bull
to
her
and
she
gave
him
that
diamond
ring
i
guessed
what
there
was
between
the
two
and
i
should
have
liked
to
snatch
the
ring
and
trample
on
it
very
soon
i
knew
everything
everything
there
are
always
people
ready
to
carry
rumours
because
it
hurts
others
besides
they
have
never
hidden
themselves
going
everywhere
like
man
and
wife
in
the
sight
of
every
one
on
horseback
just
like
gipsies
who
ride
from
fair
to
fair
when
we
were
at
the
farm
i
had
news
of
everything
juan
was
doing
and
afterwards
in
san
lucar
also
el
nacional
interposed
seeing
carmen
so
upset
and
weeping
at
these
recollections
my
good
woman
do
you
believe
all
this
humbug
do
you
not
see
they
are
inventions
of
people
who
wish
you
ill
all
jealousy
nothing
more
no
i
know
juan
do
you
believe
that
this
is
the
first
he
is
as
he
is
and
can
not
be
otherwise
cursed
profession
which
seems
to
send
men
mad
after
we
had
been
married
two
years
he
fell
in
love
with
a
handsome
girl
in
the
market
a
butcher
daughter
how
i
suffered
when
i
knew
it
but
i
never
said
a
word
even
now
he
thinks
i
know
nothing
since
then
how
many
have
there
been
i
do
not
know
how
many
dozens
and
i
held
my
tongue
wishing
for
peace
in
my
home
but
this
woman
is
not
like
the
others
juan
is
mad
about
her
and
i
know
he
has
lowered
himself
a
thousand
times
remembering
that
she
is
a
great
lady
so
that
she
should
not
turn
him
out
being
ashamed
of
having
relations
with
a
torero
now
she
is
gone
you
did
not
know
it
she
is
gone
because
she
was
bored
in
seville
you
see
people
tell
me
everything
and
she
left
without
saying
to
him
when
he
went
there
the
other
day
he
found
the
door
locked
now
he
is
as
wretched
as
a
sick
horse
he
goes
among
his
friends
with
a
face
like
a
funeral
and
drinks
to
enliven
himself
no
he
can
not
forget
that
woman
he
was
proud
of
being
loved
by
a
woman
of
that
class
and
now
he
suffers
in
his
pride
that
he
is
abandoned
ay
what
disgust
i
feel
he
is
no
longer
my
husband
he
seems
like
some
one
else
we
scarcely
speak
i
am
alone
upstairs
he
sleeps
downstairs
in
one
of
the
patio
rooms
before
i
overlooked
everything
they
were
bad
habits
belonging
to
the
profession
the
mania
of
toreros
who
think
themselves
irresistible
to
women
but
now
i
ca
bear
to
see
him
i
feel
repugnance
towards
him
she
spoke
energetically
and
a
flame
of
hate
shone
in
her
eyes
ay
that
woman
how
she
has
changed
him
he
is
another
man
he
only
cares
now
to
go
with
rich
people
and
the
people
in
the
suburbs
and
the
poor
in
seville
who
were
his
friends
and
helped
him
when
he
first
began
all
complain
of
him
some
fine
day
they
will
start
a
disturbance
against
him
in
the
plaza
to
disgrace
him
money
comes
in
here
by
bucketsful
and
it
is
not
easy
to
count
it
he
himself
does
not
know
how
much
he
has
but
i
see
clearly
he
plays
heavily
so
that
his
new
friends
may
welcome
him
and
he
loses
largely
the
money
comes
in
by
one
door
and
goes
out
by
the
other
but
i
say
nothing
after
all
it
is
he
that
earns
it
he
has
had
to
borrow
from
don
josé
for
things
about
the
farm
and
some
olive
yards
he
bought
this
year
to
join
to
the
property
were
bought
with
other
people
money
almost
all
he
earns
during
the
next
season
will
go
to
pay
his
debts
and
if
he
had
an
accident
if
he
found
himself
obliged
to
retire
like
others
he
has
tried
to
change
me
as
he
himself
has
changed
i
know
he
feels
ashamed
of
us
when
he
returns
from
seeing
doña
sol
it
is
he
who
has
obliged
me
to
put
on
those
unbecoming
hats
from
madrid
that
make
me
feel
like
a
monkey
dancing
on
an
organ
and
a
mantilla
is
so
beautiful
he
also
it
is
who
has
bought
that
infernal
car
in
which
i
go
in
fear
and
which
smells
like
the
devil
if
he
could
he
would
even
put
a
hat
with
a
cock
tail
on
the
little
mother
head
the
banderillero
interrupted
no
no
juan
was
very
kind
and
if
he
did
these
things
it
was
because
he
wished
his
family
to
have
every
comfort
and
luxury
juaniyo
may
be
anything
you
will
señora
carmen
but
still
you
must
forgive
him
a
good
deal
remember
that
many
are
envious
of
you
is
it
nothing
to
be
the
wife
of
the
bravest
torero
with
handfuls
of
money
a
house
that
is
a
marvel
and
to
be
absolute
mistress
of
everything
for
the
master
lets
you
dispose
of
all
carmen
eyes
were
overflowing
and
she
raised
her
handkerchief
to
wipe
away
her
tears
i
would
rather
be
the
wife
of
a
shoemaker
how
often
have
i
thought
so
if
juan
had
only
gone
on
with
his
trade
instead
of
this
cursed
how
much
happier
i
should
be
in
a
poor
shawl
taking
his
dinner
to
the
doorway
where
he
worked
like
his
father
at
least
he
would
be
mine
and
no
one
would
want
to
take
him
from
me
we
might
want
necessities
but
on
sundays
dressed
in
our
best
we
should
go
to
breakfast
at
some
little
inn
and
then
the
frights
one
has
from
those
horrid
bulls
this
is
not
living
there
is
money
a
great
deal
of
money
but
believe
me
sebastian
it
is
like
poison
to
me
the
people
about
think
i
am
happy
and
envy
me
but
my
eyes
follow
the
poor
women
who
want
everything
but
who
have
their
child
on
their
arm
who
when
they
are
unhappy
look
at
the
little
one
and
laugh
with
it
if
only
i
had
one
if
juan
could
but
see
a
little
one
in
the
house
that
would
be
all
his
own
something
more
than
the
little
nephews
the
banderillero
came
out
from
this
interview
shocked
and
troubled
and
went
in
search
of
his
master
whom
he
found
at
the
door
of
the
juan
i
have
just
seen
your
wife
things
are
going
worse
and
worse
try
and
calm
her
and
set
yourself
right
with
her
curse
it
life
is
not
worth
living
would
to
god
a
bull
might
catch
me
on
sunday
and
then
all
would
be
over
and
for
what
life
is
worth
he
was
rather
tipsy
the
frowning
silence
he
met
in
his
house
drove
him
to
desperation
and
even
perhaps
more
still
although
he
would
not
confess
it
to
anyone
doña
sol
flight
without
leaving
a
single
word
not
even
a
line
to
bid
him
farewell
they
had
sent
him
away
from
the
door
worse
than
a
servant
and
no
one
knew
where
that
woman
had
gone
the
marquis
was
not
much
interested
in
his
niece
journey
a
most
crazy
woman
neither
had
he
been
informed
of
her
intended
departure
however
he
did
not
think
on
that
account
that
she
was
lost
she
would
give
signs
of
existence
from
some
far
country
whither
her
caprices
had
driven
her
gallardo
could
not
conceal
his
despair
in
his
own
home
maddened
by
the
frowning
silence
of
his
wife
who
resented
all
his
efforts
at
conversation
he
would
break
out
curse
my
bad
luck
would
to
god
that
on
sunday
one
of
those
muira
bulls
would
catch
me
trample
me
and
then
i
could
be
brought
home
to
you
in
a
basket
do
say
such
things
evil
one
exclaimed
señora
angustias
do
not
tempt
god
it
will
bring
you
bad
luck
but
the
interposed
sententiously
taking
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
flatter
the
espada
do
worry
yourself
little
mother
there
is
no
bull
that
can
touch
him
no
horn
that
can
gore
him
the
following
sunday
was
the
last
corrida
of
the
year
in
which
gallardo
was
to
take
part
the
morning
passed
without
those
vague
terrors
and
superstitious
anxieties
which
usually
assailed
him
he
dressed
gaily
with
a
nervous
excitability
which
seemed
to
double
the
strength
of
his
muscles
what
a
joy
to
tread
again
the
yellow
sand
to
astonish
over
twelve
thousand
spectators
with
his
grace
and
reckless
daring
nothing
was
true
but
his
art
which
gained
him
the
applause
of
the
populace
and
money
like
heaps
of
corn
everything
else
family
and
amours
were
only
complications
of
life
serving
to
create
worries
ay
what
estocades
he
would
give
he
felt
the
strength
of
a
giant
he
felt
another
man
free
from
fears
and
anxieties
he
was
even
impatient
it
was
not
yet
time
to
go
to
the
plaza
so
contrary
to
other
occasions
and
he
longed
to
pour
out
on
the
bulls
the
concentrated
anger
caused
by
his
domestic
dissensions
and
doña
sol
insulting
flight
when
the
carriage
arrived
gallardo
crossed
the
patio
without
encountering
as
heretofore
the
emotion
of
the
women
carmen
did
not
appear
bah
those
women
their
only
use
was
to
embitter
life
his
was
waiting
extremely
proud
of
himself
in
a
suit
of
clothes
that
he
had
filched
from
the
espada
and
had
altered
to
his
own
figure
you
are
finer
than
the
real
roger
de
flor
himself
said
he
gaily
jump
into
the
coach
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
plaza
he
sat
down
beside
the
great
man
swelling
with
pride
that
all
seville
should
see
him
sitting
among
the
torero
silk
capes
and
splendid
gold
embroideries
the
plaza
was
crammed
it
was
an
important
corrida
the
last
one
of
the
autumn
and
consequently
it
had
attracted
an
immense
audience
not
only
from
the
town
but
from
the
country
on
the
benches
of
the
sunny
side
were
crowds
of
people
from
surrounding
villages
from
the
first
gallardo
showed
a
feverish
activity
he
stood
away
from
the
barrier
going
to
meet
the
bull
amusing
it
with
his
cape
play
while
the
picadors
waited
for
the
time
when
the
brute
would
turn
on
their
miserable
horses
a
certain
predisposition
against
the
torero
could
be
noticed
he
was
applauded
the
same
as
ever
but
the
demonstrations
were
far
warmer
and
more
prolonged
on
the
shady
side
from
the
symmetrical
rows
of
white
hats
than
from
the
lively
and
motley
sunny
side
where
many
stood
in
their
shirt
sleeves
under
the
heat
of
the
scorching
sun
gallardo
understood
the
danger
if
he
had
the
least
bad
luck
half
the
circus
would
rise
up
against
him
vociferating
and
reproaching
him
for
his
ingratitude
towards
those
who
had
first
started
him
he
killed
his
first
bull
with
only
moderate
good
fortune
he
threw
himself
with
his
usual
audacity
between
the
horns
but
the
rapier
struck
on
a
bone
the
enthusiasts
applauded
because
the
estocade
was
well
placed
and
the
inutility
of
the
endeavour
was
no
fault
of
his
he
put
himself
again
in
position
to
kill
but
again
the
sword
struck
on
the
same
place
and
the
bull
butting
at
the
muleta
jerked
it
out
of
the
wound
throwing
it
to
some
distance
taking
another
rapier
from
garabato
hand
he
turned
again
towards
the
beast
who
waited
for
him
firm
on
his
feet
his
neck
dripping
with
blood
and
his
slavering
muzzle
almost
on
the
sand
the
maestro
spreading
his
muleta
before
the
brute
eyes
quietly
moved
aside
with
his
sword
the
banderillas
which
were
falling
across
his
poll
he
wished
to
execute
the
descabello
leaning
the
point
of
the
blade
on
the
top
of
the
head
he
sought
for
a
suitable
spot
between
the
two
horns
he
then
made
an
effort
to
drive
in
the
rapier
the
bull
shivered
painfully
but
still
remained
on
foot
and
threw
out
the
steel
with
a
rough
movement
of
its
head
one
shouted
mocking
voices
from
the
sunny
side
curse
them
why
did
the
people
attack
him
so
unjustly
again
the
matador
struck
in
the
steel
succeeding
this
time
in
finding
the
vulnerable
spot
and
the
bull
fell
suddenly
with
a
crash
his
horns
sticking
into
the
sand
his
belly
upward
and
his
legs
rigid
the
people
on
the
shady
side
applauded
from
a
class
feeling
but
from
the
sunny
side
came
a
storm
of
whistling
and
invectives
gallardo
turning
his
back
to
these
insults
saluted
his
partizans
with
the
muleta
and
the
rapier
the
insults
of
the
populace
who
had
up
to
now
been
so
friendly
exasperated
him
and
he
clenched
his
fists
what
do
those
people
want
the
bull
did
not
admit
of
anything
better
curse
them
it
is
got
up
by
my
enemies
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
corrida
close
to
the
barrier
looking
on
disdainfully
at
his
companions
actions
accusing
them
mentally
of
having
promoted
this
display
of
dissatisfaction
and
he
launched
maledictions
against
the
bull
and
the
shepherd
who
reared
him
he
had
come
so
well
prepared
to
do
great
things
and
then
to
meet
with
a
bull
like
this
all
the
breeders
who
sent
in
such
animals
ought
to
be
shot
when
he
took
his
killing
weapons
for
his
second
bull
he
gave
an
order
to
el
nacional
and
to
another
peon
to
bring
the
bull
by
their
cloak
play
to
the
popular
side
of
the
plaza
he
knew
his
public
you
must
flatter
those
citizens
of
the
sun
a
tumultuous
and
terrible
demagogy
who
brought
class
hatred
into
the
plaza
but
who
would
change
their
whistling
into
applause
with
the
greatest
ease
if
a
slight
show
of
consideration
flattered
their
pride
the
peons
throwing
their
capes
in
front
of
the
bull
endeavoured
to
attract
him
towards
the
sunny
side
of
the
circus
the
populace
saw
this
manoeuvre
and
welcomed
it
with
joyful
surprise
the
supreme
moment
the
death
of
the
bull
would
be
enacted
under
their
eyes
instead
of
at
a
distance
for
the
convenience
of
the
wealthy
people
on
the
shady
side
the
brute
being
alone
for
a
moment
on
that
side
of
the
plaza
attacked
the
dead
body
of
a
horse
it
buried
its
horns
in
the
open
belly
lifting
on
its
horns
like
a
limp
rag
the
miserable
carcass
which
spread
its
entrails
all
round
the
body
fell
to
the
ground
almost
doubled
up
while
the
bull
moved
off
undecidedly
but
it
soon
turned
again
to
sniff
it
snorting
and
burying
its
horns
in
the
cavity
of
the
stomach
while
the
populace
laughed
at
this
stupid
obstinacy
seeking
for
life
in
an
inanimate
body
go
it
what
strength
he
has
go
on
son
i
looking
at
you
but
suddenly
the
attention
of
the
audience
was
turned
from
the
furious
brute
to
watch
gallardo
who
was
crossing
the
plaza
with
light
step
bending
his
figure
carrying
in
one
hand
the
folded
muleta
and
balancing
the
rapier
in
the
other
like
a
light
cane
all
the
populace
roared
with
delight
at
the
torero
approach
you
have
gained
them
said
el
nacional
who
had
placed
himself
with
his
cloak
in
readiness
close
to
the
bull
the
multitude
clapping
their
hands
called
the
torero
here
here
every
one
wishing
to
see
the
bull
killed
in
front
of
his
own
bench
so
as
not
to
lose
a
single
detail
and
the
torero
hesitated
between
the
contradictory
calls
of
thousands
of
voices
with
one
foot
on
the
step
of
the
barrier
he
was
considering
the
best
place
to
kill
the
bull
he
had
better
take
him
a
little
further
on
the
torero
felt
embarrassed
by
the
body
of
the
horse
whose
miserable
remains
seemed
to
fill
all
that
side
of
the
arena
he
was
turning
to
give
the
order
to
el
nacional
to
have
the
body
removed
when
he
heard
behind
him
a
voice
he
knew
and
though
he
could
not
at
once
recall
to
whom
it
belonged
it
made
him
turn
round
suddenly
good
evening
seño
juan
we
are
going
to
applaud
truth
he
saw
in
the
first
rank
below
the
rope
of
the
inside
barrier
a
jacket
folded
on
the
line
of
the
wall
on
it
were
crossed
a
pair
of
arms
in
shirt
sleeves
on
which
rested
a
broad
face
freshly
shaved
with
the
hat
pulled
down
to
its
ears
it
looked
like
a
countryman
come
in
from
his
village
to
see
the
corrida
gallardo
recognized
him
it
was
plumitas
he
had
fulfilled
his
promise
there
he
was
audaciously
among
twelve
thousand
people
who
might
recognise
him
saluting
the
espada
who
felt
pleased
and
grateful
for
this
mark
of
confidence
gallardo
was
astounded
at
his
temerity
to
come
down
into
seville
to
enter
the
plaza
far
away
from
the
mountains
where
defence
was
so
easy
without
the
help
of
his
two
companions
the
mare
and
the
rifle
and
all
to
see
him
kill
bulls
truly
of
the
two
which
was
the
braver
man
he
thought
furthermore
that
in
his
farm
he
was
at
plumitas
mercy
in
the
country
life
which
was
only
possible
if
he
kept
on
good
terms
with
that
extraordinary
person
certainly
this
bull
must
be
for
him
he
smiled
at
the
bandit
who
was
placidly
watching
him
he
took
off
his
montera
shouting
towards
the
heaving
crowd
but
with
his
eyes
on
plumitas
this
bull
is
for
you
he
threw
his
montera
towards
the
benches
where
a
hundred
hands
were
outstretched
fighting
to
catch
the
sacred
deposit
gallardo
signed
to
el
nacional
so
that
with
opportune
cape
play
he
should
bring
the
bull
towards
him
the
espada
spread
his
muleta
and
the
beast
attacked
with
a
deep
snort
passing
under
the
red
rag
olé
roared
the
crowd
once
more
bewitched
by
their
old
idol
and
disposed
to
think
everything
he
did
admirable
he
continued
giving
several
passes
to
the
bull
amid
the
exclamations
of
the
people
a
few
steps
from
him
and
who
seeing
him
close
were
giving
him
advice
be
careful
gallardo
the
bull
still
has
his
full
strength
do
get
between
him
and
the
barrier
keep
your
retreat
open
others
more
enthusiastic
excited
his
audacity
by
more
daring
advice
give
him
one
of
your
own
zas
strike
and
you
pocket
him
but
the
brute
was
too
big
and
too
mistrustful
to
be
put
in
pocket
excited
by
the
proximity
of
the
dead
horse
he
constantly
returned
to
it
as
though
the
stench
of
the
belly
intoxicated
him
in
one
of
his
evolutions
the
bull
fatigued
by
the
muleta
stood
motionless
it
was
a
very
bad
position
but
gallardo
had
come
out
of
worse
corners
victorious
he
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
brute
quiescence
the
public
incited
him
to
action
among
the
men
standing
by
the
inside
barrier
leaning
their
bodies
half
over
it
so
as
not
to
lose
a
single
detail
of
the
supreme
moment
he
recognised
many
amateurs
of
the
people
who
had
begun
to
turn
from
him
and
who
were
now
again
applauding
him
touched
by
his
show
of
consideration
for
the
populace
take
advantage
of
it
my
lad
now
we
shall
see
the
truth
strike
truly
gallardo
turned
his
head
slightly
to
salute
plumitas
who
stood
smiling
with
his
moon
face
leaning
on
his
arms
over
the
jacket
for
you
comrade
and
he
placed
himself
in
profile
with
the
rapier
in
front
in
position
to
kill
but
at
the
same
instant
he
thought
that
the
ground
was
trembling
beneath
him
that
he
was
flung
to
a
great
distance
that
the
plaza
was
falling
down
on
him
that
everything
was
turning
to
deep
blackness
and
that
a
furious
hurricane
was
raging
round
him
his
body
vibrated
painfully
from
head
to
foot
his
head
seemed
bursting
and
a
mortal
agony
wrung
his
chest
then
he
seemed
falling
into
dark
and
endless
space
plunging
into
nothingness
at
the
very
moment
that
he
was
preparing
to
strike
the
bull
had
reared
unexpectedly
against
him
attracted
by
his
querencia
for
the
horse
which
was
behind
him
it
was
a
terrific
shock
which
made
the
silk
and
gold
clad
man
roll
and
disappear
beneath
the
hoofs
the
horns
did
not
gore
him
but
the
blow
was
horrible
crushing
as
head
horns
and
all
the
frontal
of
the
brute
crashed
down
on
the
man
like
a
blow
from
a
club
the
bull
who
only
saw
the
horse
was
going
to
charge
it
again
but
feeling
some
obstacle
between
his
hoofs
he
turned
to
attack
the
brilliant
figure
lying
on
the
ground
lifted
it
on
one
horn
shaking
it
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
flinging
it
away
to
some
distance
again
a
third
time
it
turned
to
attack
the
insensible
torero
the
crowd
bewildered
by
the
quickness
of
these
events
remained
silent
their
hearts
tightened
the
bull
would
kill
him
perhaps
he
had
killed
him
already
but
suddenly
a
yell
from
the
whole
multitude
broke
the
agonizing
silence
a
cape
was
spread
between
the
bull
and
his
victim
a
cloth
almost
nailed
on
to
the
brute
poll
by
two
strong
arms
endeavouring
to
blind
the
beast
it
was
el
nacional
who
impelled
by
despair
had
thrown
himself
on
the
bull
choosing
to
be
gored
himself
if
only
he
could
save
his
master
the
brute
bewildered
by
this
fresh
obstacle
turned
upon
it
turning
his
tail
towards
the
fallen
man
the
banderillero
engaged
between
the
horns
moved
backwards
with
the
bull
waving
his
cape
not
knowing
how
to
extricate
himself
from
this
perilous
position
but
satisfied
all
the
same
at
having
drawn
the
ferocious
brute
away
from
gallardo
the
public
absorbed
by
this
fresh
incident
almost
forgot
the
espada
el
nacional
would
fall
also
he
could
not
get
out
from
between
the
horns
and
the
brute
carried
him
along
as
if
he
were
already
impaled
the
men
shouted
as
if
their
cries
could
have
been
of
any
assistance
the
women
sobbed
turning
their
heads
aside
and
wringing
their
hands
when
the
banderillero
taking
advantage
of
a
moment
when
the
brute
lowered
his
head
to
gore
him
slipped
from
between
the
horns
to
one
side
while
the
bull
rushed
blindly
on
carrying
away
the
ragged
cape
on
his
horns
the
tense
feeling
broke
out
into
deafening
applause
the
unstable
crowd
only
impressed
by
the
danger
of
the
moment
acclaimed
el
nacional
it
was
the
finest
moment
of
his
life
and
in
their
excitement
they
scarcely
noticed
the
inanimate
body
of
gallardo
who
with
his
head
hanging
down
was
being
carried
out
of
the
plaza
between
the
toreros
and
arena
servants
in
seville
that
night
nothing
was
spoken
of
but
gallardo
accident
the
worst
he
had
ever
had
in
many
towns
special
sheets
had
already
been
published
and
the
papers
all
over
spain
gave
accounts
of
the
affair
which
was
wired
in
all
directions
as
if
some
political
personage
had
been
the
victim
of
an
attempt
terrifying
news
flew
about
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
coloured
by
the
vivid
southern
imagination
poor
gallardo
had
just
died
he
who
brought
the
news
had
seen
him
lying
on
a
bed
in
the
infirmary
of
the
plaza
as
white
as
paper
with
a
crucifix
between
his
hands
so
it
must
be
true
according
to
others
less
lugubrious
he
was
still
alive
though
he
might
die
at
any
moment
all
his
bowels
were
torn
his
heart
his
loins
everything
the
bull
had
made
a
perfect
sieve
of
his
body
guards
had
been
placed
around
the
plaza
to
prevent
the
mob
anxious
for
news
from
storming
the
infirmary
outside
the
populace
had
assembled
asking
every
one
who
came
out
as
to
the
espada
state
el
nacional
still
in
his
fighting
dress
came
out
several
times
frowning
and
angry
as
the
preparations
for
his
master
removal
were
not
ready
seeing
the
banderillero
the
mob
forgot
the
wounded
man
in
their
congratulations
señor
sebastian
you
were
splendid
had
it
not
been
for
you
but
he
refused
all
congratulations
what
did
it
signify
what
he
had
done
nothing
at
all
rubbish
the
important
thing
was
condition
who
was
in
the
infirmary
struggling
with
death
and
how
is
he
seño
sebastian
asked
the
people
returning
to
their
first
interest
very
bad
he
has
only
just
recovered
consciousness
he
has
one
leg
broken
to
bits
a
gore
underneath
the
arm
and
what
besides
i
know
not
the
poor
fellow
is
to
me
like
my
own
saint
we
are
going
to
take
him
home
when
the
night
closed
in
gallardo
was
carried
out
of
the
circus
on
a
litter
the
crowd
walked
silently
after
him
every
few
moments
el
nacional
carrying
the
cape
on
his
arm
and
still
wearing
his
showy
torero
dress
amongst
the
common
clothes
of
the
people
leaned
over
the
cover
of
the
litter
and
ordered
the
porters
to
stop
the
doctors
belonging
to
the
plaza
walked
behind
and
with
them
the
marquis
de
moraima
and
don
josé
the
manager
who
seemed
ready
to
faint
in
the
arms
of
some
friends
of
the
one
common
anxiety
mixing
them
up
with
the
ragged
crew
who
also
followed
the
litter
the
crowd
were
horrified
it
was
a
sad
procession
as
though
some
national
disaster
had
occurred
which
levelled
all
beneath
the
general
misfortune
what
a
misfortune
seño
marque
said
a
peasant
who
carried
his
jacket
on
his
arm
to
the
marquis
de
moraima
twice
this
man
had
pushed
aside
some
of
the
porters
of
the
litter
wishing
to
assist
in
carrying
it
the
marquis
looked
at
him
sympathetically
he
must
be
one
of
those
country
peasants
who
were
accustomed
to
salute
him
on
the
roads
yes
a
great
misfortune
my
lad
do
you
think
he
will
die
seño
marque
it
is
to
be
feared
unless
a
miracle
saves
him
he
is
ground
to
powder
and
the
marquis
placing
his
right
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
unknown
man
seemed
pleased
by
the
sorrow
expressed
on
his
countenance
gallardo
return
to
his
house
was
most
painful
inside
the
patio
were
heard
cries
of
despair
and
outside
other
women
friends
and
neighbours
of
juaniyo
were
screaming
and
tearing
their
hair
thinking
him
already
dead
the
litter
was
carried
into
a
room
off
the
patio
and
the
espada
with
the
greatest
care
was
lifted
on
to
a
bed
he
was
wrapped
in
bloody
cloths
and
bandages
smelling
of
antiseptics
of
his
fighting
dress
he
retained
nothing
but
one
pink
stocking
and
his
under
garments
were
all
torn
or
cut
with
scissors
his
pigtail
hung
unplaited
and
entangled
on
his
neck
and
his
face
was
as
pale
as
a
wafer
he
opened
his
eyes
slightly
feeling
a
hand
slipped
into
his
and
saw
carmen
a
carmen
as
pale
as
himself
and
terrified
the
friends
of
the
torero
prudently
intervened
she
must
remember
the
wounded
man
had
only
received
first
aid
and
a
great
deal
remained
for
the
doctors
to
do
the
wounded
man
made
a
sign
with
his
eyes
to
el
nacional
who
leaned
over
him
to
catch
the
slight
murmur
juan
says
he
murmured
going
out
into
the
patio
he
would
like
doctor
ruiz
sent
for
it
is
already
done
said
the
manager
pleased
with
his
prevision
he
had
telegraphed
at
once
when
he
knew
the
importance
of
the
accident
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
doctor
ruiz
was
already
on
the
way
and
would
arrive
on
the
following
morning
after
their
first
bewilderment
the
doctors
were
more
hopeful
it
was
possible
he
might
not
die
he
had
such
a
splendid
constitution
and
such
energy
what
was
most
to
be
dreaded
was
the
terrible
shock
which
would
have
killed
most
men
instantaneously
but
he
had
recovered
consciousness
although
the
weakness
was
great
as
far
as
the
wounds
were
concerned
they
did
not
think
them
dangerous
that
on
the
arm
was
not
much
though
it
was
possible
the
limb
might
be
less
agile
than
before
the
hurt
on
the
leg
did
not
offer
equal
hopes
the
bones
were
fractured
and
probably
gallardo
would
be
lame
don
josé
who
had
endeavoured
to
keep
calm
when
hours
before
he
had
thought
the
espada
death
inevitable
quite
broke
down
his
matador
lame
then
he
would
no
longer
be
able
to
fight
he
was
furious
at
the
calm
with
which
the
doctors
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
gallardo
becoming
useless
as
a
torero
that
could
not
be
do
you
think
it
logical
that
juan
should
live
and
not
fight
who
would
fill
his
place
i
tell
you
it
can
not
be
the
first
man
in
the
world
and
you
want
him
to
retire
he
spent
the
night
watching
with
the
men
of
the
cuadrilla
and
gallardo
and
next
morning
early
he
went
to
the
station
to
meet
the
madrid
express
it
arrived
and
with
it
ruiz
he
came
without
any
luggage
as
carelessly
dressed
as
ever
smiling
behind
his
yellowish
beard
bobbing
along
in
his
loose
coat
with
the
swinging
of
his
little
short
legs
and
his
big
stomach
like
a
buddha
as
he
entered
the
house
the
torero
who
seemed
sunk
in
the
extreme
of
weakness
opened
his
eyes
reviving
with
a
smile
of
confidence
after
ruiz
had
listened
in
a
corner
to
the
other
doctors
opinions
and
explanations
he
approached
the
bed
courage
my
lad
this
will
not
finish
you
you
have
good
luck
and
then
he
added
turning
to
his
colleagues
see
what
a
magnificent
animal
this
juanillo
is
another
one
by
now
would
not
be
giving
us
any
work
he
examined
him
very
carefully
it
was
a
cogida
which
required
great
care
but
he
had
seen
so
many
wounds
were
his
spécialité
and
in
them
he
always
expected
the
most
extraordinary
cures
as
if
the
horns
gave
at
the
same
time
the
wound
and
its
remedy
you
may
almost
say
that
he
who
is
not
killed
outright
in
the
plaza
is
saved
the
cure
becomes
then
only
a
matter
of
time
for
three
days
gallardo
endured
tortures
his
weakness
preventing
the
use
of
anæsthetics
and
doctor
ruiz
extracted
several
splinters
of
bone
from
the
broken
leg
who
has
said
you
would
be
useless
for
fighting
exclaimed
the
doctor
satisfied
with
his
own
cleverness
you
will
fight
my
son
the
public
will
still
have
to
applaud
you
the
manager
agreed
with
this
exactly
what
he
had
thought
how
could
that
lad
who
was
the
first
man
in
the
world
end
his
life
in
that
fashion
by
order
of
doctor
ruiz
the
torero
family
were
moved
to
don
house
the
women
drove
him
wild
and
their
proximity
was
intolerable
during
the
hours
of
the
operations
a
groan
from
the
torero
would
instantly
be
answered
from
every
part
of
the
house
by
the
howls
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
carmen
struggled
like
a
mad
woman
to
go
to
her
husband
sorrow
had
changed
the
wife
making
her
forget
her
rancour
the
fault
is
mine
she
would
often
say
despairingly
to
el
nacional
he
said
very
often
he
wished
a
bull
would
end
him
once
for
all
i
have
been
very
wrong
i
have
embittered
his
life
in
vain
the
banderillero
recalled
all
the
details
to
convince
her
that
the
misfortune
was
accidental
no
according
to
her
gallardo
had
wished
to
end
it
for
ever
and
had
it
not
been
for
el
nacional
he
would
have
been
carried
dead
out
of
the
arena
when
the
operations
were
over
the
family
returned
to
the
house
and
carmen
paid
her
first
visit
to
the
sick
man
she
entered
the
room
quietly
with
cast
down
eyes
as
if
she
were
ashamed
of
her
former
hostility
and
taking
juan
hand
in
both
hers
she
asked
how
are
you
gallardo
seemed
shrunk
by
pain
pale
and
weak
with
an
almost
childish
resignation
nothing
remained
of
the
proud
and
gallant
fellow
who
had
delighted
the
populace
with
his
audacity
he
seemed
daunted
by
the
terrible
operations
endured
in
full
consciousness
all
his
indifference
to
pain
had
vanished
and
he
moaned
at
the
slightest
discomfort
after
ten
days
stay
in
seville
the
doctor
returned
to
madrid
now
my
lad
he
said
to
the
sick
man
you
do
require
me
any
longer
and
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
now
do
be
imprudent
and
in
a
couple
of
months
you
will
be
well
and
strong
it
is
possible
you
may
feel
your
leg
a
little
but
you
have
a
constitution
of
iron
and
it
will
go
on
getting
better
gallardo
cure
progressed
as
doctor
ruiz
had
foretold
at
the
end
of
a
month
the
leg
was
liberated
from
its
enforced
quiet
and
the
torero
weak
and
limping
slightly
was
able
to
sit
in
a
chair
in
the
patio
and
receive
his
friends
during
his
illness
when
fever
ran
high
and
gloomy
nightmares
troubled
him
one
thought
always
remained
steadfast
in
his
mind
in
spite
of
all
restless
wanderings
the
remembrance
of
doña
sol
did
that
woman
know
of
his
accident
while
he
was
still
in
bed
he
had
ventured
to
question
the
manager
about
her
when
they
chanced
to
be
alone
yes
my
man
said
don
josé
she
has
remembered
you
she
sent
me
a
wire
from
nice
enquiring
after
you
two
or
three
days
after
the
accident
most
probably
she
saw
it
in
the
papers
they
spoke
about
you
everywhere
as
if
you
were
a
king
the
manager
had
replied
to
the
telegram
but
had
not
heard
subsequently
from
her
gallardo
appeared
satisfied
for
some
days
with
this
explanation
but
afterwards
asked
again
with
a
sick
man
persistence
had
she
not
written
had
she
not
enquired
again
after
him
the
manager
tried
to
excuse
doña
sol
silence
and
console
him
he
must
remember
she
was
always
moving
about
goodness
knows
where
she
might
be
at
that
time
but
the
torero
despair
thinking
himself
forgotten
forced
don
josé
to
pious
lies
some
days
before
he
had
received
a
short
letter
from
italy
in
which
doña
sol
inquired
after
him
let
me
see
it
said
the
espada
anxiously
and
as
the
manager
made
some
excuse
pretending
to
have
left
it
at
home
gallardo
implored
this
comfort
do
bring
it
to
me
i
long
to
see
her
letter
to
convince
myself
that
she
remembers
me
to
avoid
further
complications
in
his
pretences
don
josé
invented
a
correspondence
that
did
not
pass
through
his
hands
but
was
directed
to
others
doña
sol
had
written
according
to
him
to
the
marquis
about
her
money
matters
and
at
the
end
of
every
letter
she
enquired
after
gallardo
at
other
times
the
letters
were
to
a
cousin
in
which
were
the
same
remembrances
of
the
torero
gallardo
listened
quietly
but
at
the
same
time
shook
his
head
doubtfully
when
would
he
see
her
should
he
ever
see
her
again
ay
what
a
woman
to
fly
like
that
without
any
motive
except
the
caprices
of
her
strange
character
what
you
ought
to
do
said
the
manager
is
to
forget
all
about
and
attend
to
business
you
are
no
longer
in
bed
and
you
are
almost
cured
how
do
you
feel
as
to
strength
say
shall
we
fight
or
no
you
have
all
the
winter
before
you
to
recover
strength
shall
we
accept
contracts
or
do
you
decline
to
fight
this
year
gallardo
raised
his
head
proudly
as
though
something
dishonouring
was
being
proposed
to
him
renounce
spend
a
whole
year
without
being
seen
in
the
circus
could
the
public
resign
themselves
to
such
an
absence
accept
them
don
josé
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
get
strong
between
now
and
the
spring
you
may
promise
for
the
easter
corrida
i
think
this
leg
may
still
give
me
some
trouble
but
please
god
it
will
soon
be
as
strong
as
iron
he
longed
for
the
time
to
return
to
the
circus
he
felt
greedy
of
fame
and
the
applause
of
the
populace
and
in
order
to
get
quite
strong
he
decided
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
winter
with
his
family
at
la
rinconada
there
hunting
and
long
walks
would
strengthen
his
leg
besides
he
could
ride
about
to
overlook
the
work
and
visit
the
herds
of
goats
the
droves
of
pigs
the
dairies
and
the
mares
grazing
in
the
meadows
the
management
of
the
farm
had
not
been
good
everything
cost
him
more
than
it
did
other
landlords
and
the
receipts
were
less
his
who
had
established
himself
at
the
farm
as
a
kind
of
dictator
to
set
things
right
had
only
succeeded
in
disturbing
the
routine
of
the
work
and
rousing
the
labourers
anger
it
was
fortunate
that
gallardo
could
count
on
the
certain
incomings
from
the
corridas
an
inexhaustible
source
of
wealth
which
would
over
and
above
recoup
his
extravagances
and
bad
management
before
leaving
for
la
rinconada
señora
angustias
wished
her
son
to
fulfil
her
vow
of
kneeling
before
the
virgin
of
hope
it
was
a
vow
she
had
made
that
terrible
night
when
she
saw
him
stretched
pale
and
lifeless
on
the
litter
how
many
times
she
had
wept
before
la
macarena
the
beautiful
queen
of
heaven
with
the
long
and
swarthy
cheeks
imploring
her
not
to
forget
juanillo
the
ceremony
was
a
popular
rejoicing
all
the
gardeners
of
the
suburb
were
summoned
to
the
church
of
san
gil
which
was
filled
with
flowers
piled
up
in
banks
round
the
altars
and
hanging
in
garlands
between
the
arches
and
from
the
chandeliers
the
ceremony
took
place
on
a
beautiful
sunny
morning
in
spite
of
its
being
a
working
day
the
church
was
filled
with
people
from
the
suburb
stout
women
with
black
eyes
wearing
black
silk
dresses
and
lace
mantillas
over
their
pale
faces
workmen
freshly
shaved
and
the
beggars
arrived
in
swarms
forming
a
double
row
at
the
church
door
a
mass
was
to
be
sung
with
accompaniment
of
orchestra
and
voices
something
quite
out
of
the
way
like
the
opera
in
the
san
fernando
theatre
at
easter
and
afterwards
the
priests
would
intone
a
te
deum
of
thanksgiving
for
the
recovery
of
señor
juan
gallardo
the
same
as
when
the
king
came
to
seville
the
party
arrived
making
their
way
through
the
crowd
the
mother
and
wife
walked
first
among
relations
and
friends
dressed
in
rustling
black
silks
smiling
beneath
their
mantillas
gallardo
came
after
followed
by
an
interminable
escort
of
toreros
and
friends
all
dressed
in
light
suits
with
gold
chains
and
rings
of
extraordinary
brilliancy
their
white
felt
hats
contrasting
strangely
with
the
black
clothes
gallardo
was
very
grave
he
was
a
good
believer
he
did
not
often
remember
god
though
he
often
swore
by
him
blasphemously
at
difficult
moments
more
by
habit
than
anything
else
but
this
was
quite
another
affair
he
was
going
to
return
thanks
to
the
santisima
macarena
and
he
entered
the
church
reverently
they
all
went
in
except
el
nacional
who
leaving
his
wife
and
children
remained
in
the
little
square
i
am
a
freethinker
he
thought
it
necessary
to
explain
to
a
group
of
friends
i
respect
all
beliefs
but
that
inside
there
is
for
me
rubbish
i
do
not
wish
to
be
wanting
in
respect
to
la
macarena
nor
to
take
away
any
credit
which
is
hers
but
comrades
suppose
i
had
not
arrived
in
time
to
draw
away
the
bull
when
juaniyo
was
on
the
ground
through
the
open
doors
came
the
wail
of
instruments
the
voices
of
the
singers
a
sweet
and
flowing
melody
accompanied
by
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
and
the
smell
of
wax
when
the
party
came
out
all
the
poor
people
scrambled
and
quarrelled
for
the
handfuls
of
money
thrown
to
them
there
was
enough
for
everybody
for
gallardo
was
liberal
and
señora
angustias
wept
with
joy
leaning
her
head
on
a
friend
shoulder
the
espada
appeared
at
the
church
door
radiant
and
magnificent
giving
his
arm
to
his
wife
and
carmen
smiling
with
a
tear
on
her
eyelashes
felt
as
if
she
were
being
married
to
him
a
second
time
footnote
the
descabello
is
a
de
given
to
a
bull
already
pierced
by
a
rapier
the
stroke
consists
in
driving
the
rapier
straight
down
behind
the
skull
so
as
to
pierce
the
spinal
marrow
if
it
is
badly
delivered
the
animal
only
gets
a
slight
wound
and
it
is
considered
very
unskilful
and
rouses
the
indignation
of
the
populace
chapter
vii
when
the
holy
week
came
round
gallardo
gave
his
mother
a
great
pleasure
in
previous
years
as
a
devotee
of
our
father
jesus
of
great
power
he
had
walked
in
the
procession
of
the
parish
of
san
lorenzo
wearing
the
long
black
tunic
with
high
pointed
hood
and
mask
which
only
left
the
eyes
visible
it
was
the
aristocratic
brotherhood
and
when
the
torero
found
himself
on
the
high
road
to
fortune
he
had
entered
it
avoiding
the
popular
brotherhood
whose
devotion
was
generally
accompanied
by
drunkenness
and
scandal
he
spoke
with
pride
of
the
serious
gravity
of
this
religious
association
everything
was
well
ordered
and
strictly
disciplined
as
in
a
regiment
on
the
night
of
holy
thursday
as
the
clock
of
san
lorenzo
struck
the
second
stroke
of
two
in
the
morning
the
church
doors
would
be
suddenly
opened
so
that
the
crowd
massed
on
the
dark
pavement
outside
could
see
the
interior
of
the
church
resplendent
with
lights
and
the
brotherhood
drawn
up
in
order
the
hooded
men
silent
and
gloomy
with
no
sign
of
life
but
the
flash
of
their
eyes
through
the
black
mask
advanced
slowly
two
by
two
each
holding
a
large
wax
taper
in
his
hand
and
leaving
a
wide
space
between
each
pair
for
their
long
sweeping
trains
the
crowd
with
southern
impressionability
watched
the
passing
of
this
hooded
train
which
they
called
nazarenos
with
deepest
interest
for
some
of
these
mysterious
masks
might
be
great
noblemen
whom
traditional
piety
had
induced
to
take
part
in
this
nocturnal
procession
the
brotherhood
obliged
to
keep
silence
under
pain
of
mortal
sin
were
escorted
by
municipal
guards
to
prevent
them
being
molested
by
the
drunken
rabble
who
began
their
holy
week
holiday
on
wednesday
night
by
visits
to
every
tavern
it
happened
now
and
then
that
the
guards
relaxed
their
vigilance
which
enabled
these
impious
tipplers
to
place
themselves
alongside
of
the
silent
brothers
and
whisper
atrocious
insults
against
their
unknown
persons
or
their
equally
unknown
families
the
nazarene
suffered
in
silence
swallowing
the
insults
offering
them
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
lord
of
great
power
the
rascals
emboldened
by
this
meekness
would
redouble
their
insults
till
at
last
the
pious
mask
considering
that
if
silence
was
obligatory
inaction
was
not
would
lift
their
wax
tapers
and
thrash
the
intruders
which
somewhat
upset
the
holy
meditations
of
the
ceremony
in
the
course
of
the
procession
when
the
porters
of
the
pasos
required
rest
and
the
huge
platforms
hung
round
with
lanthorns
on
which
the
figures
stood
halted
a
slight
whistle
was
enough
to
stop
the
hooded
figures
who
turned
facing
each
other
resting
their
large
tapers
on
their
feet
looking
at
the
crowd
through
the
mysterious
slit
of
the
mask
above
the
pointed
hoods
floated
the
banners
of
the
brotherhood
squares
of
black
velvet
with
gold
fringes
on
which
were
embroidered
the
roman
letters
in
commemoration
of
the
part
played
by
the
procurator
of
judea
in
the
condemnation
of
the
just
one
the
paso
of
our
father
jesus
of
great
power
stood
on
a
heavy
platform
of
worked
metal
trimmed
all
round
with
hangings
of
black
velvet
which
fell
to
the
ground
concealing
the
twenty
and
perspiring
porters
at
each
of
the
four
corners
hung
groups
of
lanthorns
and
golden
angels
and
in
the
centre
stood
jesus
crowned
with
thorns
and
bending
under
the
weight
of
his
cross
a
tragical
dolorous
jesus
with
cadaverous
face
and
tearful
eyes
but
magnificently
dressed
in
a
velvet
tunic
covered
with
gold
flowers
which
only
showed
the
stuff
as
a
slight
arabesque
between
the
complicated
embroideries
the
appearance
of
the
lord
of
great
power
drew
sighs
and
groans
from
hundreds
of
breasts
father
jesus
murmured
the
old
women
fixing
their
hypnotised
eyes
on
the
figure
lord
of
great
power
remember
us
as
the
paso
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
plaza
with
its
hooded
escort
the
devotion
of
this
andalusian
people
which
confides
all
its
thoughts
to
song
broke
out
in
trills
and
interminable
laments
a
childish
voice
of
trembling
sweetness
broke
the
silence
some
girl
pushing
her
way
to
the
front
would
send
a
saeta
to
jesus
the
three
verses
of
which
celebrated
the
lord
of
great
power
the
most
divine
sculpture
and
the
artist
montañes
a
companion
of
the
artists
of
the
golden
age
who
had
carved
it
the
hooded
brothers
listened
motionless
till
the
conductor
of
the
paso
thinking
the
pause
had
been
long
enough
struck
a
silver
bell
on
the
front
of
the
platform
up
with
it
and
the
lord
of
great
power
after
many
oscillations
was
hoisted
up
while
the
feet
of
the
invisible
porters
began
to
move
like
tentacles
on
the
ground
after
this
came
the
virgin
our
lady
of
the
greatest
sorrow
for
all
the
parishes
sent
out
two
pasos
under
a
velvet
canopy
her
golden
crown
trembled
in
the
surrounding
lights
the
train
of
her
mantle
which
was
several
yards
long
hung
down
behind
the
paso
being
puffed
out
by
a
of
wood
which
displayed
the
splendour
of
its
rich
heavy
and
splendid
embroideries
which
must
have
exhausted
the
skill
and
patience
of
a
whole
generation
to
the
roll
of
the
drums
a
whole
troup
of
women
followed
her
their
bodies
in
the
shadow
and
their
faces
reddened
by
the
glare
of
the
tapers
they
carried
in
her
hands
old
barefooted
women
in
mantillas
girls
wearing
the
white
clothes
which
were
to
have
served
them
as
shrouds
women
who
walked
painfully
as
if
they
were
suffering
from
hidden
and
painful
maladies
an
assembly
of
suffering
humanity
saved
from
death
by
the
goodness
of
the
lord
of
great
power
and
his
blessed
mother
the
procession
of
the
pious
brotherhood
after
having
slowly
walked
through
the
streets
with
long
pauses
during
which
they
sang
hymns
entered
the
cathedral
which
remained
all
night
with
its
doors
open
with
their
lighted
tapers
they
wound
through
the
gigantic
naves
bringing
out
of
the
darkness
the
immense
pillars
hung
with
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
but
their
light
was
unable
to
disperse
the
darkness
gathered
in
the
vaults
above
leaving
this
gloom
they
came
out
again
under
the
starlight
and
the
rising
sun
ended
by
surprising
the
procession
still
wandering
about
the
streets
gallardo
was
an
enthusiast
about
the
lord
of
great
power
and
the
majestic
silence
of
the
brotherhood
it
was
a
very
serious
thing
one
might
laugh
at
the
other
pasos
for
their
disorder
and
want
of
devotion
but
to
laugh
at
this
one
never
besides
in
this
brotherhood
one
rubbed
against
very
great
people
nevertheless
this
year
the
espada
decided
to
abandon
the
lord
of
great
power
to
go
out
with
the
brotherhood
of
la
macarena
who
escorted
the
miraculous
virgin
of
hope
señora
angustias
was
delighted
when
she
heard
his
decision
he
owed
it
to
the
virgin
who
had
saved
him
after
his
last
cogida
besides
this
flattered
her
feelings
of
plebeian
simplicity
every
one
with
his
own
juaniyo
it
is
all
right
for
you
to
mix
with
gentlefolk
but
you
ought
to
think
that
the
poor
have
always
loved
you
and
that
now
they
are
speaking
against
you
because
they
think
you
despise
them
the
torero
knew
it
but
too
well
the
turbulent
populace
who
sat
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
plaza
were
beginning
to
show
a
certain
animosity
against
him
thinking
themselves
forgotten
they
criticised
his
constant
intercourse
with
wealthy
people
and
his
desertion
of
those
who
had
been
his
first
admirers
gallardo
wished
therefor
to
take
advantage
of
every
means
of
flattering
those
whose
applause
he
wanted
a
few
days
before
the
procession
he
informed
the
most
influential
members
of
la
macarena
of
his
intention
to
follow
in
it
he
did
not
wish
the
people
to
know
it
it
was
purely
an
act
of
devotion
and
he
wished
his
intention
to
remain
a
secret
all
the
same
in
a
few
days
the
suburb
was
talking
of
nothing
else
it
was
the
pride
of
the
neighbourhood
ah
we
must
see
la
macarena
this
year
said
the
gossips
as
they
spoke
of
the
torero
intention
the
señora
angustias
will
cover
the
paso
with
flowers
it
will
cost
at
least
a
hundred
duros
and
juaniyo
will
hang
all
his
jewellery
on
the
virgin
a
real
fortune
and
so
it
was
gallardo
gathered
together
all
the
jewellery
in
the
house
both
his
own
and
his
wife
to
hang
on
the
image
la
macarena
would
wear
on
her
ears
those
diamond
which
the
espada
had
bought
for
carmen
in
madrid
which
had
cost
the
proceeds
of
many
corridas
on
her
breast
she
would
wear
a
large
double
gold
chain
belonging
to
the
torero
on
which
would
hang
all
his
rings
and
the
large
diamond
studs
that
he
wore
on
his
shirt
front
jesus
how
smart
our
morena
will
be
said
they
often
speaking
of
the
virgin
seño
juan
intends
to
pay
for
everything
it
will
make
half
seville
rage
when
the
espada
was
questioned
about
it
he
smiled
modestly
he
had
always
felt
a
deep
devotion
for
la
macarena
she
was
the
virgin
of
the
suburb
in
which
he
was
born
besides
his
poor
father
had
never
failed
to
walk
in
the
procession
as
an
armed
man
it
was
an
honour
of
which
the
family
was
proud
and
had
his
own
position
admitted
of
it
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
put
on
the
helmet
and
carry
the
lance
like
so
many
gallardos
his
forebears
who
were
now
underground
this
religious
popularity
flattered
him
he
was
anxious
that
every
one
in
the
suburb
should
know
about
his
following
the
procession
but
at
the
same
time
he
dreaded
the
news
spreading
about
the
town
he
believed
in
the
virgin
and
he
wished
to
stand
well
with
her
in
view
of
future
dangers
but
he
trembled
when
he
thought
of
the
derision
of
his
friends
assembled
in
the
cafés
and
clubs
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
they
will
turn
me
into
ridicule
if
they
recognize
me
said
he
all
the
same
i
must
try
and
stand
well
with
everybody
on
the
night
of
holy
thursday
he
went
with
his
wife
to
the
cathedral
to
hear
the
miserere
the
immensely
high
gothic
arches
had
no
light
but
that
of
a
few
wax
tapers
hung
on
to
the
pillars
just
sufficient
for
the
crowd
not
to
be
obliged
to
feel
their
way
all
the
people
of
better
social
position
were
seated
in
the
side
chapels
behind
the
iron
gratings
anxious
to
avoid
contact
with
the
perspiring
masses
pouring
into
the
nave
the
choir
was
in
complete
darkness
except
for
a
few
lights
looking
like
a
starry
constellation
for
the
use
of
the
musicians
and
singers
the
miserere
of
eslava
was
sung
in
this
atmosphere
of
gloom
and
mystery
it
was
a
gay
and
graceful
andalusian
miserere
like
the
fluttering
of
wings
with
tender
romances
like
love
serenades
and
choruses
like
drinkers
rounds
full
of
that
joy
of
life
which
made
the
people
forgetful
of
death
and
rebel
against
the
gloom
of
the
passion
when
the
voice
of
the
tenor
had
ended
its
last
romance
and
the
wails
in
which
he
apostrophised
jerusalem
jerusalem
were
lost
in
the
vaults
the
crowd
dispersed
much
preferring
the
liveliness
of
the
streets
as
gay
as
a
theatre
with
their
electric
lights
and
the
rows
of
chairs
on
the
pavements
and
wooden
stages
in
the
plazas
gallardo
returned
home
quickly
to
put
on
his
nazarene
dress
señora
angustias
had
prepared
his
clothes
with
a
tenderness
which
carried
her
back
to
her
youthful
days
ay
her
poor
dear
husband
who
on
that
night
would
don
his
bellicose
array
and
shouldering
his
lance
would
leave
the
house
not
to
return
till
the
following
day
his
helmet
knocked
in
his
tonelete
a
mass
of
filth
having
camped
with
his
brethren
in
every
tavern
in
seville
the
espada
was
as
careful
of
his
underclothing
as
a
woman
and
he
put
on
his
nazarene
dress
with
the
same
scrupulous
care
as
he
did
his
fighting
costume
first
he
put
on
his
silk
stockings
and
patent
leather
shoes
then
the
white
satin
robe
his
mother
had
made
for
him
and
above
this
the
high
pointed
hood
of
green
velvet
which
fell
over
his
shoulders
and
face
like
a
mask
and
hung
down
in
front
like
a
chasuble
as
far
as
his
knees
on
one
side
of
the
breast
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
brotherhood
was
delicately
embroidered
in
variegated
colours
the
torero
having
put
on
his
white
gloves
took
the
tall
staff
which
was
a
sign
of
dignity
in
the
brotherhood
it
was
a
long
staff
covered
with
green
velvet
with
a
silver
top
and
pointed
at
the
end
with
the
same
metal
as
gallardo
took
his
way
through
the
narrow
street
on
his
way
to
san
gil
he
met
the
company
of
jews
that
is
to
say
of
armed
men
fierce
soldiers
their
faces
framed
by
their
helmets
metal
chin
strap
wearing
tunics
cotton
stockings
and
high
sandals
round
their
waists
was
fastened
the
roman
sword
and
over
their
shoulders
like
a
modern
gun
strap
was
the
cord
which
supported
their
lances
these
soldiers
young
and
old
marched
to
the
roll
of
drums
and
carried
a
roman
banner
with
the
senatorial
inscription
an
imposingly
magnificent
personage
swaggered
sword
in
hand
at
the
head
of
this
troup
gallardo
recognised
him
as
he
passed
curse
him
said
he
laughing
beneath
his
mask
no
one
will
pay
any
attention
to
me
this
will
carry
off
all
the
palms
it
was
captain
chivo
a
gipsy
singer
who
had
arrived
that
morning
from
paris
faithful
to
his
military
discipline
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
to
fail
in
this
duty
would
have
been
to
forfeit
the
title
of
captain
which
el
chivo
ostentatiously
displayed
on
every
placard
in
paris
where
he
and
his
daughters
danced
and
sang
these
girls
were
as
lively
as
lizards
graceful
of
movement
with
large
eyes
and
a
delicacy
of
colouring
and
suppleness
of
figure
which
drove
men
mad
the
eldest
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
run
away
with
a
russian
prince
and
the
parisian
papers
for
days
were
full
of
the
despair
of
that
brave
officer
of
the
spanish
army
who
intended
to
avenge
his
honour
by
shooting
the
fugitives
in
a
theatre
on
the
boulevards
a
piece
had
been
hastily
mounted
on
the
flight
of
the
gipsy
with
dances
of
toreros
choruses
of
friars
and
other
scenes
of
faithful
local
colouring
el
chivo
soon
compromised
with
his
in
consideration
of
pocketing
a
good
indemnity
and
continued
dancing
in
paris
with
the
other
girls
in
hopes
of
another
russian
prince
his
rank
as
captain
made
many
foreigners
well
informed
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
spain
thoughtful
ah
spain
a
decadent
country
which
does
not
pay
its
noble
soldiers
and
forces
its
hidalgos
to
send
their
daughters
on
the
stage
on
the
approach
of
holy
week
captain
chivo
could
no
longer
bear
his
absence
from
seville
so
he
took
farewell
of
his
daughters
with
the
air
of
a
severe
and
uncompromising
pére
noble
my
children
i
am
going
mind
that
you
are
good
observe
propriety
and
decency
my
company
is
waiting
for
me
what
would
they
say
if
their
captain
failed
them
he
thought
with
pride
as
he
travelled
from
paris
to
seville
of
his
father
and
grandfather
who
had
been
captains
of
the
jews
of
la
macarena
and
that
to
himself
fresh
glory
accrued
through
this
inheritance
from
his
forefathers
he
had
once
drawn
a
prize
of
ten
thousand
pesetas
in
the
national
lottery
and
the
whole
of
this
sum
he
had
spent
on
a
uniform
suitable
to
his
rank
the
gossips
of
the
suburb
rushed
to
have
a
look
at
the
captain
dazzling
in
his
gold
embroideries
wearing
a
burnished
metal
corselet
a
helmet
over
which
flowed
a
cascade
of
white
feathers
and
whose
brilliant
steel
reflected
all
the
light
of
the
procession
it
was
the
fantastic
magnificence
of
a
red
skin
a
princely
dress
of
which
a
drunken
auracanian
might
have
dreamt
the
women
fingered
the
velvet
kilt
admiring
its
embroideries
of
nails
hammers
thorns
in
fact
all
the
attributes
of
the
passion
his
boots
seemed
trembling
at
every
step
from
the
flashing
brilliancy
of
the
spangles
and
paste
jewels
which
covered
them
below
the
white
plumes
of
the
helmet
which
seemed
to
make
his
dark
moorish
colouring
darker
still
the
gipsy
grey
whiskers
could
be
seen
this
was
not
military
the
captain
himself
nobly
admitted
it
but
he
was
returning
to
paris
and
something
must
be
conceded
to
art
turning
his
head
with
warlike
pride
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
legionary
eagle
he
shouted
attention
let
no
one
leave
the
ranks
observe
decency
and
discipline
the
company
advanced
marching
slowly
stiffly
and
solemnly
to
the
rubadub
of
the
drum
in
every
street
were
many
taverns
and
before
their
doors
stood
boon
companions
their
hats
well
back
and
their
waistcoats
open
who
had
lost
count
of
the
innumerable
glasses
they
had
drunk
in
commemoration
of
the
lord
death
as
they
saw
the
imposing
warrior
come
along
they
hailed
him
holding
up
from
afar
glasses
of
fragrant
wine
the
captain
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
inward
perturbation
turning
his
eyes
away
and
holding
himself
up
even
more
rigidly
inside
his
metal
corselet
if
only
he
had
not
been
on
duty
some
friends
more
pressing
than
the
others
crossed
the
street
to
push
the
glass
under
the
plumed
helmet
but
the
incorruptible
centurion
drew
back
presenting
the
point
of
his
sword
duty
was
duty
this
year
at
all
events
it
should
not
be
as
other
years
in
which
the
company
had
fallen
into
disorder
and
disarray
almost
as
soon
as
they
had
started
the
streets
soon
became
real
ways
of
bitterness
for
captain
chivo
he
was
so
hot
in
his
armour
surely
a
little
wine
would
not
destroy
discipline
so
he
accepted
a
glass
and
then
another
and
soon
the
company
were
moving
along
with
gaps
in
their
ranks
strewing
the
way
with
stragglers
who
stopped
at
every
tavern
they
passed
the
procession
marched
with
traditional
slowness
waiting
hours
at
every
crossway
it
was
only
twelve
at
night
and
la
macarena
would
not
have
to
return
home
till
twelve
the
following
day
it
took
her
longer
to
go
through
the
streets
of
seville
than
it
took
to
go
from
seville
to
madrid
first
of
all
advanced
the
paso
of
the
sentence
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
a
platform
covered
with
figures
representing
pilate
seated
on
a
golden
throne
surrounded
by
soldiers
in
coloured
kilts
and
plumed
helmets
guarding
the
sorrowful
jesus
ready
to
march
to
execution
in
a
tunic
of
violet
velvet
with
resplendent
embroideries
and
three
golden
rays
representing
the
three
persons
of
the
trinity
appearing
above
his
crown
of
thorns
but
this
paso
in
spite
of
its
many
figures
and
the
richness
of
its
decoration
did
not
rivet
the
attention
of
the
crowd
it
seemed
dwarfed
by
the
one
following
it
that
of
the
queen
of
the
popular
suburbs
the
miraculous
virgin
of
hope
la
macarena
when
this
virgin
with
her
pink
cheeks
and
long
appeared
beneath
a
canopy
of
velvet
which
swayed
with
every
step
of
the
concealed
carriers
a
deafening
acclamation
rose
from
the
populace
assembled
in
the
plaza
ah
how
beautiful
she
was
the
queen
of
heaven
a
beauty
which
never
aged
her
splendid
mantle
of
immense
length
with
a
wide
reticulated
gold
border
like
the
meshes
of
a
net
extended
a
long
way
behind
the
paso
like
a
gigantic
peacock
folded
tail
her
eyes
shone
as
if
they
were
moistened
with
tears
at
the
joyous
welcome
of
the
faithful
the
image
was
covered
with
flashing
jewels
like
a
brilliant
armour
over
the
velvet
dress
they
were
in
hundreds
possibly
thousands
she
seemed
covered
with
shining
rain
drops
flaming
with
every
colour
of
the
rainbow
from
her
neck
hung
rows
of
pearls
gold
chains
on
which
hundreds
of
rings
were
strung
and
all
the
front
of
her
dress
was
plated
with
gold
watches
pendents
of
emeralds
and
brilliants
and
as
large
as
pebbles
all
the
devotees
lent
their
jewels
for
the
santisima
macarena
to
wear
on
her
progress
and
the
women
showed
their
unornamented
hands
on
that
night
of
religious
mourning
delighted
that
the
mother
of
god
should
be
wearing
those
jewels
which
were
their
pride
the
public
knew
them
for
they
saw
them
every
year
they
could
tell
all
the
tale
of
them
and
point
out
any
novelties
and
they
knew
that
the
ornaments
the
virgin
wore
on
her
breast
hanging
on
a
gold
chain
belonged
to
gallardo
the
torero
gallardo
himself
with
his
face
covered
leaning
on
the
staff
of
authority
walked
in
front
of
the
paso
with
the
dignitaries
of
the
brotherhood
others
carried
long
trumpets
hung
with
green
banners
now
and
again
they
put
them
to
their
lips
through
a
slit
in
their
masks
and
a
funereal
trumpeting
broke
the
silence
but
this
horrifying
roar
woke
no
echo
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
the
soft
spring
night
with
its
perfume
of
orange
flowers
was
too
sweet
and
smiling
in
vain
the
trumpets
roared
funereal
marches
or
the
singers
wept
as
they
sang
the
sacred
verses
or
the
soldiers
marched
frowning
like
veritable
executioners
the
spring
night
smiled
spreading
the
perfume
of
its
thousand
flowers
and
no
one
thought
of
death
the
inhabitants
of
the
suburbs
swarmed
in
disorder
round
the
virgin
small
shopkeepers
with
their
dishevelled
wives
dragging
tribes
of
children
along
by
the
hand
on
this
excursion
which
would
last
till
dawn
young
men
with
their
black
curls
flattened
over
their
ears
flourishing
sticks
as
if
some
one
intended
to
insult
la
macarena
and
their
strong
arms
would
be
required
for
her
protection
crowds
of
men
and
women
flattening
themselves
between
the
enormous
paso
and
the
walls
in
the
narrow
streets
olé
la
macarena
the
first
virgin
of
the
world
every
fifty
paces
the
saintly
platform
was
stopped
there
was
no
hurry
the
night
was
long
in
many
cases
the
virgin
was
stopped
so
that
people
could
look
at
her
at
their
ease
every
tavern
keeper
also
requested
a
halt
in
front
of
his
establishment
a
man
would
cross
the
road
towards
the
leaders
of
the
paso
here
hi
stop
here
is
the
first
singer
in
the
world
who
wants
to
sing
a
to
the
virgin
the
first
singer
in
the
world
leaning
on
a
friend
with
unsteady
legs
and
passing
on
his
glass
to
some
one
else
would
after
coughing
pour
forth
the
full
torrent
of
his
hoarse
voice
of
which
the
roulades
obscured
the
clearness
of
the
words
before
he
had
half
ended
his
slow
ditty
another
voice
would
begin
and
then
another
as
if
a
musical
contest
were
established
some
sang
like
birds
others
were
hoarse
like
broken
bellows
others
screamed
with
piercing
yells
most
of
the
singers
remained
hidden
in
the
crowd
but
others
proud
of
their
voice
and
style
planted
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
roadway
in
front
of
la
macarena
the
drums
beat
and
the
trumpets
continued
their
gloomy
blasts
everybody
sang
at
once
their
discordant
voices
mixing
with
the
deafening
instruments
but
no
one
ever
got
confused
each
one
sang
straight
through
his
saeta
without
hesitation
as
if
they
were
all
deaf
to
other
sounds
keeping
their
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
image
in
front
of
the
paso
walked
barefoot
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
purple
tunic
and
crowned
with
thorns
he
was
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
a
heavy
cross
twice
as
high
as
himself
and
when
the
paso
resumed
its
way
after
a
long
pause
charitable
souls
helped
him
to
readjust
his
burden
the
women
groaned
with
compassion
as
they
saw
him
poor
fellow
with
what
holy
fervour
he
fulfilled
his
penance
all
in
the
suburb
remembered
his
criminal
sacrilege
that
cursed
wine
which
was
men
undoing
three
years
before
on
the
morning
of
good
friday
when
la
macarena
was
on
her
way
back
to
her
church
this
poor
sinner
who
in
point
of
fact
was
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
after
wandering
about
the
streets
all
night
with
his
friends
had
stopped
the
procession
in
front
of
a
tavern
in
the
market
place
he
sang
to
the
virgin
and
then
fired
by
holy
enthusiasm
broke
out
into
compliments
olé
the
beautiful
macarena
he
loved
her
more
than
his
sweetheart
in
order
to
display
his
devotion
he
wished
to
throw
at
her
feet
what
he
held
in
his
hand
thinking
that
it
was
his
hat
but
unfortunately
it
was
a
glass
which
smashed
itself
on
the
virgin
face
he
was
carried
off
weeping
to
prison
he
did
love
la
macarena
just
as
if
she
were
his
mother
it
was
all
that
cursed
wine
which
took
men
wits
away
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
the
years
of
jail
awaiting
him
for
this
disrespect
to
religion
and
he
wept
so
effectually
that
even
those
who
were
most
indignant
with
him
ended
by
pleading
in
his
favour
and
everything
was
settled
on
his
giving
a
promise
to
perform
some
extraordinary
penance
as
a
warning
to
other
sinners
he
dragged
along
the
cross
perspiring
and
gasping
shifting
the
place
of
the
heavy
weight
when
his
shoulders
became
bruised
by
the
sorrowful
burden
his
comrades
pitied
him
and
offered
him
glasses
of
wine
not
by
way
of
mockery
of
his
penance
but
from
sheer
compassion
he
was
fainting
from
fatigue
he
ought
to
refresh
himself
but
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
refreshments
towards
the
virgin
taking
her
as
witness
of
his
martyrdom
never
mind
he
would
drink
well
without
fear
next
day
when
la
macarena
was
safely
lodged
in
her
church
the
paso
was
still
in
the
suburb
of
la
feria
while
the
head
of
the
procession
had
reached
the
centre
of
seville
the
brothers
and
the
company
of
armed
men
marched
forward
with
warlike
astuteness
it
was
a
question
of
occupying
la
campana
and
so
gaining
possession
of
the
entrance
to
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
before
any
other
brotherhood
could
present
itself
once
the
vanguard
were
in
possession
of
this
point
they
could
wait
quietly
for
hours
till
the
virgin
arrived
enjoying
the
angry
protests
of
other
brotherhoods
quite
inferior
people
whose
images
could
in
no
way
compare
with
their
macarena
and
who
were
therefore
obliged
to
take
up
a
humble
position
behind
her
often
the
rabble
escorting
the
different
pasos
came
to
blows
heads
were
broken
and
one
or
two
lads
were
hurried
off
to
prison
or
to
the
nearest
chemist
shop
meanwhile
captain
chivo
had
executed
his
great
strategic
movement
occupying
la
campana
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
to
the
noisy
and
triumphant
roll
of
his
drums
there
is
no
thoroughfare
here
long
live
the
virgin
of
la
macarena
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
was
turned
into
a
saloon
its
balconies
were
full
of
people
electric
lights
hung
across
it
from
house
to
house
all
the
cafés
and
shops
were
illuminated
heads
filled
every
window
and
crowds
of
people
sat
on
the
rows
of
chairs
placed
against
the
walls
on
which
they
stood
up
whenever
a
roll
of
drums
or
the
blast
of
trumpets
announced
the
coming
of
any
paso
that
night
no
one
in
the
town
slept
even
old
ladies
of
regular
habits
waited
now
till
dawn
to
watch
the
innumerable
processions
although
it
was
now
three
in
the
morning
nothing
indicated
the
lateness
of
the
hour
people
were
feasting
in
the
cafés
and
taverns
succulent
odours
escaped
through
the
doors
of
the
fried
fish
shops
in
the
centre
of
the
street
itinerant
sellers
of
drinks
and
sweets
had
established
themselves
and
many
families
who
only
came
out
on
great
holidays
had
been
there
since
two
on
the
previous
afternoon
waiting
to
watch
the
endless
passing
of
virgins
of
bewildering
magnificence
whose
velvet
mantles
several
yards
long
drew
forth
cries
of
admiration
of
redeemers
with
golden
crowns
and
tunics
of
brocade
a
whole
world
of
absurd
images
in
theatrical
splendour
about
which
there
was
nothing
religious
beyond
their
cadaverous
and
bloody
faces
the
sevillians
in
front
of
the
cafés
pointed
out
the
pasos
by
name
to
the
foreigners
who
had
come
to
see
this
strange
christian
ceremony
as
lively
as
a
pagan
holiday
they
enumerated
the
paso
of
the
holy
decree
of
the
holy
christ
of
silence
of
our
lady
of
bitterness
of
jesus
with
the
cross
on
his
shoulder
of
our
lady
of
the
valley
of
our
father
jesus
of
the
three
falls
of
our
lady
of
tears
of
the
lord
of
a
holy
death
of
our
lady
of
the
three
necessities
and
all
these
images
were
accompanied
by
their
special
nazarenes
black
or
white
red
green
blue
or
violet
all
masked
and
preserving
their
mysterious
personality
beneath
their
pointed
hoods
the
heavy
pasos
advanced
slowly
and
laboriously
through
the
narrow
streets
but
when
they
emerged
into
the
plaza
de
san
francisco
opposite
the
boxes
raised
in
front
of
the
palace
of
the
ayuntamiento
the
pasos
gave
a
half
turn
so
that
the
images
might
face
the
seats
and
by
a
genuflexion
performed
by
their
porters
salute
the
illustrious
strangers
or
royal
personages
who
had
come
to
see
the
fiesta
alongside
of
the
pasos
walked
lads
carrying
jars
of
water
as
soon
as
the
platform
halted
a
corner
of
the
velvet
hangings
was
raised
and
twenty
or
thirty
men
appeared
perspiring
half
naked
purple
with
fatigue
with
kerchiefs
tied
round
their
heads
and
the
look
of
exhausted
savages
these
were
the
gallicians
the
strong
porters
for
any
of
that
calling
were
merged
in
that
nationality
they
drank
the
water
greedily
and
if
there
were
a
tavern
at
hand
mutinied
against
the
conductor
of
the
paso
to
obtain
wine
or
food
the
crowd
surged
restlessly
with
eager
curiosity
in
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
as
the
pasos
of
the
macarenos
ramp
along
in
a
compact
procession
accompanied
by
bands
of
music
the
drums
redoubled
their
beating
the
trumpets
roared
furiously
all
the
tumultuous
crew
from
the
suburb
shouted
and
yelled
and
every
one
got
up
on
the
chairs
in
order
to
see
better
this
slow
but
noisy
cortége
at
the
door
of
a
café
el
nacional
with
all
his
family
stood
watching
the
passing
of
the
brotherhood
retrograde
superstition
but
all
the
same
he
came
every
year
to
watch
this
noisy
invasion
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
by
the
macarenos
he
immediately
recognized
gallardo
from
his
magnificent
stature
and
the
elegance
with
which
he
wore
the
inquisitorial
garments
juanillo
cried
he
make
the
paso
stop
here
are
some
foreign
ladies
who
would
like
to
see
it
close
the
holy
platform
stood
still
the
band
broke
out
into
a
spirited
march
one
of
those
which
delighted
the
public
at
the
and
immediately
the
hidden
porters
of
the
paso
began
to
lift
first
one
foot
then
the
other
executing
a
dance
which
made
the
platform
sway
with
violent
oscillations
throwing
the
surrounding
people
against
the
walls
the
virgin
with
all
her
load
of
jewels
flowers
lanthorns
and
even
the
heavy
canopy
danced
up
and
down
to
the
sound
of
the
music
this
was
a
spectacle
which
required
immense
practise
and
of
which
the
macarenos
were
extremely
proud
the
strong
young
men
of
the
suburb
holding
on
to
each
side
of
the
paso
supported
it
following
its
violent
swaying
while
fired
by
this
display
of
strength
and
dexterity
they
shouted
all
seville
should
see
this
this
is
splendid
only
the
macarenos
can
do
this
the
brotherhood
continued
their
triumphal
march
leaving
deserters
in
every
tavern
and
fallen
all
along
the
streets
when
the
sun
rose
it
found
them
at
the
extreme
opposite
end
of
seville
from
their
own
parish
and
the
image
and
its
remaining
supporters
looked
like
a
dissolute
band
returning
from
an
orgy
close
to
the
market
place
the
two
pasos
stood
deserted
while
all
the
procession
took
their
morning
draft
in
the
adjacent
taverns
substituting
large
glasses
of
cazalla
aguardiente
for
country
wine
of
the
brilliant
jewish
army
nothing
remained
but
miserable
relics
as
if
they
were
straggling
home
after
a
defeat
the
captain
walked
with
a
sad
stagger
his
feathery
plumes
hanging
down
limp
over
his
livid
face
and
his
sole
idea
seemed
to
be
to
preserve
his
magnificent
costume
from
dirty
handling
respect
the
uniform
gallardo
left
the
procession
soon
after
sunrise
he
thought
he
had
done
quite
enough
in
accompanying
the
virgin
throughout
the
night
and
assuredly
she
would
lay
it
to
his
account
besides
this
last
part
of
the
fiesta
was
by
far
the
most
trying
till
the
macarena
returned
to
her
church
about
the
people
who
got
up
fresh
after
a
good
sleep
laughed
at
the
hooded
brothers
who
looked
ridiculous
by
daylight
and
who
moreover
bore
traces
of
the
drunkenness
and
dirt
of
the
night
it
would
not
be
prudent
for
a
torero
to
be
seen
with
this
band
of
tipplers
waiting
for
them
at
tavern
doors
señora
angustias
was
waiting
for
her
son
in
the
patio
to
assist
the
nazarene
in
removing
his
garments
he
must
rest
now
he
had
accomplished
his
duties
towards
the
virgin
on
easter
sunday
there
was
a
corrida
the
first
since
his
accident
cursed
profession
in
which
ease
of
mind
was
impossible
and
the
poor
women
after
a
period
of
tranquillity
saw
all
their
anguish
and
terrors
revive
saturday
and
the
morning
of
sunday
the
torero
spent
in
receiving
visits
of
enthusiastic
amateurs
who
had
come
to
seville
for
the
holy
week
and
the
fair
they
all
smiled
confident
in
his
future
exploits
we
shall
see
how
you
fight
the
has
its
eyes
on
you
how
are
you
with
regard
to
strength
gallardo
did
not
distrust
his
vigour
those
winter
months
in
the
country
had
made
him
quite
robust
he
was
now
quite
as
strong
as
before
his
cogida
the
only
thing
that
reminded
him
of
his
accident
when
he
was
shooting
at
the
farm
was
a
slight
weakness
in
the
broken
leg
but
this
was
only
noticeable
after
long
walks
i
will
do
my
best
murmured
gallardo
with
feigned
modesty
i
hope
i
shall
not
come
out
of
it
badly
the
manager
intervened
with
the
blindness
of
his
faith
you
will
fight
like
an
angel
you
will
put
all
the
bulls
in
your
pocket
gallardo
admirers
forgetting
the
corrida
for
a
moment
spoke
about
a
piece
of
news
flying
round
the
town
on
a
mountain
in
the
province
of
cordoba
the
civil
guards
had
found
a
decomposed
body
with
the
head
almost
blown
to
pieces
apparently
by
a
point
blank
shot
it
was
impossible
to
recognize
it
but
its
clothes
the
carbine
everything
in
short
made
them
think
it
must
be
plumitas
gallardo
listened
silently
he
had
not
seen
the
bandit
since
his
accident
but
he
kept
a
kindly
remembrance
of
him
his
farm
people
had
told
him
that
twice
while
he
was
in
danger
plumitas
had
called
at
the
farm
to
enquire
about
him
afterwards
while
he
was
staying
there
himself
on
several
occasions
his
shepherds
and
workmen
had
spoken
mysteriously
of
plumitas
who
knowing
he
was
at
la
rinconada
had
asked
for
news
of
señor
juan
when
he
met
them
on
the
road
poor
fellow
gallardo
pitied
him
as
he
remembered
his
predictions
the
civil
guards
had
not
killed
him
he
had
been
murdered
during
his
sleep
probably
he
had
been
shot
by
one
of
his
own
class
some
amateur
who
wished
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
his
departure
for
the
corrida
on
sunday
was
even
more
painful
than
on
former
occasions
carmen
did
her
best
to
be
calm
and
help
garabato
to
dress
his
master
and
señora
angustias
hovered
outside
the
room
longing
to
see
juanillo
once
more
as
if
she
were
going
to
lose
him
when
gallardo
came
out
into
the
patio
with
his
montera
on
his
head
and
his
beautiful
cape
thrown
over
one
shoulder
his
mother
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
dissolved
in
tears
she
did
not
utter
a
word
but
her
noisy
sighs
revealed
her
thoughts
he
was
going
to
fight
for
the
first
time
since
his
accident
and
in
the
same
plaza
where
it
had
happened
the
superstitions
of
this
woman
of
the
people
rose
up
against
such
imprudence
ay
when
would
he
retire
from
this
cursed
profession
had
they
not
yet
money
enough
but
his
interfered
in
his
capacity
of
family
adviser
now
then
little
mother
it
was
not
such
a
great
thing
after
all
it
was
only
a
corrida
like
any
other
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
leave
juan
in
peace
and
not
upset
his
calmness
by
this
snivelling
just
as
he
was
going
to
the
plaza
carmen
was
braver
she
did
not
cry
and
accompanied
her
husband
to
the
door
wishing
to
encourage
him
now
that
in
consequence
of
his
accident
love
had
revived
and
they
lived
quietly
together
she
could
not
believe
that
any
accident
would
occur
to
disturb
them
that
accident
was
god
work
who
often
brings
good
out
of
evil
juan
would
fight
as
on
other
occasions
and
would
return
home
safe
and
sound
good
luck
to
you
she
watched
the
departure
of
the
carriage
with
loving
eyes
as
it
drove
away
followed
by
a
crowd
of
little
ragamuffins
delighted
at
the
sight
of
the
torero
golden
clothes
but
when
the
poor
woman
was
alone
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
lighted
the
tapers
before
an
image
of
the
virgin
of
hope
el
nacional
rode
in
the
coach
frowning
and
gloomy
that
sunday
was
the
day
of
the
elections
and
none
of
his
companions
of
the
cuadrilla
had
taken
any
notice
of
it
they
would
do
nothing
but
talk
of
the
death
of
plumitas
and
the
approaching
it
was
too
bad
to
have
his
functions
as
a
good
citizen
interrupted
by
this
corrida
preventing
him
carrying
off
several
friends
to
the
voting
urn
who
would
not
go
unless
he
took
them
don
joselito
had
been
imprisoned
with
other
friends
on
account
of
his
eloquence
on
the
tribunes
and
el
nacional
who
wished
to
share
his
martyrdom
had
been
obliged
to
put
on
his
gala
costume
instead
and
go
off
with
his
master
was
this
assault
on
the
liberty
of
citizens
to
remain
unnoticed
would
not
the
people
rise
as
the
coach
drove
along
through
la
campana
the
toreros
saw
a
large
crowd
of
people
apparently
shouting
seditiously
and
waving
their
sticks
the
police
agents
were
charging
them
sword
in
hand
and
a
free
fight
seemed
in
progress
el
nacional
rose
from
his
seat
trying
to
throw
himself
out
of
the
carriage
ah
at
last
the
moment
has
come
the
revolution
now
the
populace
is
rising
but
his
master
half
laughing
half
angry
seized
him
and
pushed
him
back
in
his
seat
do
be
an
idiot
sebastian
you
only
see
revolutions
and
hobgoblins
everywhere
the
rest
of
the
cuadrilla
laughed
as
they
guessed
the
truth
the
noble
people
being
unable
to
obtain
tickets
for
the
corrida
at
the
office
in
la
campana
were
trying
to
take
it
by
storm
and
set
fire
to
it
being
prevented
by
the
police
el
nacional
bent
his
head
sorrowfully
reaction
and
ignorance
all
the
want
of
knowing
how
to
read
and
write
a
noisy
ovation
awaited
them
as
they
arrived
at
the
plaza
and
frantic
rounds
of
clapping
greeted
the
procession
of
the
cuadrilla
all
the
applause
was
for
gallardo
the
public
welcomed
his
reappearance
in
the
arena
after
that
tremendous
cogida
which
had
been
talked
of
all
over
the
peninsula
when
the
time
came
for
gallardo
to
kill
his
first
bull
the
explosions
of
enthusiasm
recommenced
women
in
white
mantillas
followed
him
with
their
he
was
applauded
and
acclaimed
on
the
sunny
side
just
as
much
as
on
the
shady
side
even
his
enemies
seemed
influenced
by
this
current
of
sympathy
poor
fellow
he
had
suffered
so
much
the
whole
plaza
was
his
never
had
gallardo
seen
an
audience
so
completely
his
own
he
took
off
his
montera
before
the
presidential
chair
to
give
the
brindis
olé
olé
nobody
heard
a
word
but
they
all
yelled
enthusiastically
the
applause
followed
him
as
he
went
towards
the
bull
ceasing
in
a
silence
of
expectation
as
he
approached
it
he
unfolded
his
muleta
standing
in
front
of
the
animal
but
at
some
distance
not
as
in
former
days
when
he
fired
the
people
by
spreading
the
red
rag
almost
on
its
muzzle
in
the
silence
of
the
plaza
there
was
a
movement
of
surprise
but
no
one
uttered
a
word
several
times
gallardo
stamped
on
the
ground
to
excite
the
beast
who
at
last
attacked
feebly
passing
under
the
muleta
but
the
torero
drew
himself
on
one
side
with
visible
haste
many
on
the
benches
looked
at
each
other
what
did
that
mean
the
espada
saw
el
nacional
by
his
side
and
a
few
steps
further
back
another
peon
but
he
did
not
shout
as
formerly
every
one
out
of
the
way
from
the
benches
arose
the
sound
of
sharp
discussions
even
the
friends
thought
some
explanation
necessary
he
still
feels
his
wounds
he
ought
not
to
fight
that
leg
do
you
see
it
the
capes
of
the
two
peons
helped
the
espada
in
his
passes
the
beast
was
restless
bewildered
by
the
red
cloths
and
as
soon
as
it
charged
the
muleta
some
other
cape
attracted
it
away
from
the
torero
gallardo
as
if
he
wished
to
get
out
of
this
disagreeable
situation
squared
himself
with
his
rapier
high
and
threw
himself
on
the
bull
a
murmur
of
absolute
stupefaction
greeted
the
stroke
the
blade
entering
only
a
third
of
its
length
trembled
ready
to
fly
out
gallardo
had
slipped
out
from
between
the
horns
without
driving
the
blade
in
up
to
the
hilt
as
in
former
days
the
stroke
was
well
placed
all
the
same
shouted
the
enthusiasts
clapping
as
hard
as
they
could
so
that
their
noise
should
supply
the
place
of
numbers
but
the
connoisseurs
smiled
with
pity
that
lad
was
going
to
lose
the
only
merit
he
possessed
his
nerve
and
daring
they
had
seen
him
instinctively
shorten
his
arm
at
the
moment
of
striking
the
bull
with
the
rapier
and
they
had
seen
him
turn
his
face
aside
with
that
shrinking
of
fear
which
prevents
a
man
looking
danger
full
in
the
face
the
rapier
rolled
on
the
ground
and
gallardo
taking
another
turned
again
towards
the
bull
accompanied
by
his
peons
el
nacional
cape
was
constantly
spread
close
to
him
to
distract
the
beast
and
the
banderillero
bellowing
bewildered
it
and
made
it
turn
whenever
it
approached
gallardo
too
closely
the
second
estocade
was
scarcely
more
fortunate
than
the
first
as
more
than
half
the
blade
remained
uncovered
he
does
not
lean
on
it
they
began
to
shout
from
the
benches
the
horns
frighten
him
gallardo
opened
his
arms
like
a
cross
in
front
of
the
bull
to
show
the
public
behind
him
that
the
bull
had
had
enough
and
might
fall
at
any
moment
but
the
animal
still
remained
on
foot
moving
its
head
about
uneasily
from
side
to
side
el
nacional
exciting
him
with
the
rag
made
him
run
taking
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
hit
him
heavily
on
the
neck
with
his
cape
with
all
the
strength
of
his
arm
the
populace
guessing
his
intention
began
to
abuse
him
he
was
making
the
brute
run
in
order
that
the
sword
should
fix
itself
in
firmer
and
his
heavy
blows
with
the
cape
were
to
drive
it
in
deeper
they
called
him
a
thief
abusing
his
mother
and
other
relations
threatening
sticks
were
flourished
on
the
sunny
side
and
a
shower
of
bottles
oranges
and
any
missiles
to
hand
showered
down
on
the
arena
with
the
intention
of
striking
him
but
the
good
fellow
bore
all
the
insults
as
if
he
were
blind
and
deaf
and
he
continued
following
up
the
bull
happy
in
fulfilling
his
duties
and
saving
a
friend
suddenly
a
stream
of
blood
gushed
from
the
brute
mouth
and
he
quietly
bent
his
knees
remaining
motionless
but
still
with
his
head
high
as
if
he
intended
to
rise
again
and
attack
the
puntillero
came
up
anxious
to
finish
him
as
quickly
as
possible
and
get
the
espada
out
of
the
difficulty
el
nacional
helped
him
by
leaning
furtively
on
the
sword
and
driving
it
in
up
to
the
hilt
unluckily
the
populace
on
the
sunny
side
saw
this
manoeuvre
and
rose
to
their
feet
transported
with
rage
howling
thief
assassin
they
were
furious
in
the
name
of
the
poor
bull
as
if
he
had
not
to
die
in
any
case
and
they
shook
their
fists
threateningly
at
el
nacional
as
if
he
had
committed
some
crime
under
their
very
eyes
and
the
banderillero
ashamed
ended
by
taking
refuge
behind
the
barriers
gallardo
in
the
meanwhile
walked
towards
the
president
chair
to
salute
while
his
unreasoning
partizans
accompanied
him
with
applause
as
noisy
as
it
was
ill
supported
he
had
no
luck
said
they
proof
against
all
disillusions
the
estocades
were
well
placed
no
one
can
deny
that
the
espada
stood
for
a
few
moments
opposite
the
benches
where
his
most
fervent
partizans
were
seated
and
leaning
on
the
barrier
he
explained
it
was
a
very
bad
bull
there
had
been
no
means
of
making
a
good
job
of
it
the
partizans
with
don
josé
at
their
head
assented
it
was
just
what
they
had
thought
themselves
gallardo
remained
the
greater
part
of
the
corrida
by
the
step
of
the
barrier
plunged
in
gloomy
thought
it
was
all
very
well
making
these
explanations
to
his
friends
but
he
felt
a
cruel
doubt
in
his
own
mind
a
distrust
of
his
own
powers
that
he
had
never
felt
before
the
bulls
seemed
to
him
bigger
and
endowed
with
a
double
life
which
made
them
refuse
to
die
whereas
formerly
they
had
fallen
under
his
rapier
with
miraculous
facility
indubitably
they
had
loosed
the
worst
of
the
herd
for
him
to
do
him
an
evil
turn
some
intrigue
of
his
enemies
most
probably
other
suspicions
too
rose
confusedly
from
the
depths
of
his
mind
but
he
scarcely
dared
to
drag
them
out
of
their
darkness
and
verify
them
his
arm
seemed
shorter
at
the
moment
when
he
presented
the
rapier
in
front
of
him
formerly
it
had
reached
the
brute
neck
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
now
there
seemed
a
fearful
and
interminable
space
that
he
knew
not
how
to
cover
his
legs
too
seemed
different
they
seemed
to
be
free
and
independent
of
the
rest
of
his
body
in
vain
his
will
ordered
them
to
remain
calm
and
firm
as
in
former
days
but
they
did
not
obey
they
seemed
to
have
eyes
which
saw
the
danger
and
leapt
aside
with
exceeding
lightness
as
soon
as
they
felt
the
brute
charging
gallardo
turned
against
the
public
the
rage
he
felt
at
his
failure
and
his
sudden
weakness
what
did
those
people
want
was
he
to
let
himself
be
killed
for
their
pleasure
did
he
not
carry
marks
enough
of
his
mad
daring
on
his
body
he
had
no
need
to
prove
his
courage
that
he
was
still
alive
was
a
miracle
and
owing
to
celestial
intervention
because
god
is
good
and
had
listened
to
the
prayers
of
his
mother
and
his
poor
wife
he
had
seen
the
fleshless
face
of
death
closer
than
most
people
and
he
now
knew
better
than
any
one
the
value
of
living
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
have
my
skin
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
the
crowd
in
future
he
would
fight
much
as
his
companions
did
some
days
he
would
do
well
some
days
after
all
was
only
a
profession
and
once
one
had
got
into
the
front
rank
the
most
important
thing
was
to
live
carrying
out
one
engagements
as
best
one
could
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
kill
his
second
bull
his
cogitations
had
brought
him
into
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
there
was
no
animal
that
could
kill
him
all
the
same
he
would
do
what
he
could
not
to
get
within
reach
of
the
horns
as
he
went
towards
the
bull
he
carried
himself
with
the
same
proud
bearing
as
on
his
best
afternoons
out
of
the
way
everybody
the
audience
rustled
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
he
had
said
out
of
the
way
everybody
he
was
going
to
repeat
one
of
his
old
strokes
but
what
the
public
hoped
for
did
not
happen
neither
did
el
nacional
cease
to
follow
him
with
his
cape
on
his
arm
guessing
with
the
knowledge
of
an
old
peon
accustomed
to
the
bombast
of
matadors
the
theatrical
hollowness
of
that
order
gallardo
spread
his
cape
at
some
distance
from
the
bull
and
began
the
passes
with
visible
apprehension
always
helped
by
sebastian
cape
once
when
the
muleta
remained
low
for
an
instant
the
bull
moved
as
if
intending
to
charge
he
did
not
but
the
espada
over
and
above
alert
deceived
by
this
movement
took
a
few
steps
back
which
were
real
bounds
flying
from
an
animal
which
did
not
intend
to
attack
him
this
unnecessary
retreat
placed
him
in
a
very
ridiculous
position
and
the
crowd
laughed
with
surprise
and
many
whistles
were
heard
hey
he
catching
you
yelled
an
ironical
voice
poor
dear
cried
another
in
comically
feminine
tones
gallardo
crimsoned
with
anger
this
to
him
and
in
the
plaza
of
seville
he
felt
the
proud
of
his
early
days
a
mad
desire
to
fall
wildly
on
the
bull
and
let
what
god
would
happen
but
his
limbs
refused
to
obey
his
arms
seemed
to
think
his
legs
to
see
the
danger
but
with
a
sudden
reaction
at
these
insults
the
audience
themselves
came
to
his
assistance
and
imposed
silence
what
a
shame
to
treat
a
man
like
this
who
was
only
just
convalescent
from
his
serious
wounds
it
was
unworthy
of
the
plaza
of
seville
at
least
let
them
observe
decency
gallardo
took
advantage
of
this
expression
of
sympathy
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
approaching
the
bull
sideways
he
gave
him
a
treacherous
and
crossways
stroke
the
animal
fell
like
a
beast
at
the
shambles
a
torrent
of
blood
rushing
from
his
mouth
some
applauded
others
whistled
but
the
great
mass
remained
gloomily
silent
they
have
loosed
you
treacherous
curs
cried
his
manager
from
his
seat
in
spite
of
the
corrida
being
supplied
from
the
marquis
herds
these
are
not
bulls
we
shall
see
a
difference
when
they
are
noble
bulls
truth
as
he
left
the
plaza
gallardo
could
gauge
the
discontent
of
the
people
by
their
silence
many
groups
passed
him
but
not
a
salutation
not
an
acclamation
such
as
he
had
always
received
on
his
lucky
days
the
espada
tasted
for
the
first
time
the
bitterness
of
failure
even
his
banderilleros
were
frowning
and
silent
like
defeated
soldiers
but
when
he
got
home
and
felt
his
mother
arms
round
his
neck
and
the
caresses
of
carmen
and
the
little
nephews
his
sadness
vanished
curse
it
all
the
really
important
thing
was
to
live
that
the
family
should
be
quiet
and
happy
and
to
earn
the
public
money
without
any
foolhardiness
which
must
lead
to
death
on
the
following
days
he
recognized
the
necessity
of
showing
himself
and
of
talking
with
his
friends
in
the
people
cafés
and
in
the
clubs
of
the
calle
de
las
sierpes
he
thought
that
his
presence
would
impose
a
courteous
silence
on
evil
speakers
and
cut
short
commentaries
on
his
fiasco
he
spent
whole
afternoons
amid
the
poorer
aficionados
whom
he
had
neglected
for
so
long
while
he
cultivated
the
friendship
of
the
richer
class
afterwards
he
went
to
the
where
his
manager
was
enforcing
his
opinions
by
shouts
and
thumps
maintaining
as
ever
the
superiority
of
gallardo
excellent
don
josé
his
enthusiasm
was
immutable
bomb
proof
it
never
could
occur
to
him
that
his
matador
could
possibly
cease
to
be
as
he
had
always
been
he
did
not
offer
a
single
criticism
on
his
fiasco
on
the
contrary
he
himself
endeavoured
to
find
excuses
mingling
with
them
the
comfort
of
his
good
advice
you
still
feel
your
what
i
say
is
will
all
see
him
when
he
is
quite
cured
and
then
you
will
give
me
news
of
him
do
as
you
did
formerly
go
straight
to
the
bull
with
that
courage
which
god
has
given
you
and
zas
plunge
the
blade
in
up
to
the
cross
and
you
put
him
in
your
pocket
gallardo
assented
with
an
enigmatic
smile
put
the
bulls
in
his
pocket
he
wished
for
nothing
better
but
ay
lately
they
had
become
so
big
and
so
intractable
they
had
grown
so
enormously
since
he
last
trod
the
arena
gambling
was
gallardo
consolation
making
him
forget
his
anxieties
for
the
moment
and
with
fresh
energy
he
returned
to
the
green
table
to
lose
his
money
surrounded
by
his
former
friends
who
did
not
care
in
the
least
about
his
failures
as
long
as
he
was
an
elegant
torero
one
night
they
all
went
to
supper
at
the
inn
at
eritana
a
festivity
given
in
honour
of
some
foreign
ladies
of
gay
life
with
whom
some
of
the
young
men
had
become
acquainted
in
paris
they
had
come
to
seville
in
order
to
see
the
festival
of
the
holy
week
and
the
fair
and
were
anxious
to
see
all
that
was
most
picturesque
in
the
place
consequently
they
wished
to
become
acquainted
with
the
celebrated
torero
the
most
elegant
of
all
the
espadas
that
gallardo
whose
portrait
they
had
so
often
admired
in
popular
prints
and
on
the
tops
of
the
gathering
was
held
in
the
large
of
eritana
a
pavilion
in
the
gardens
decorated
in
extremely
bad
taste
with
vulgar
imitations
of
the
moorish
splendours
of
the
alhambra
gallardo
was
greeted
as
a
demigod
by
these
three
women
who
ignoring
their
other
friends
quarrelled
for
the
honour
of
sitting
beside
him
in
a
way
they
reminded
him
of
the
absent
one
with
their
golden
hair
and
elegant
dresses
and
their
perfumes
produced
a
kind
of
bewilderment
the
presence
of
his
friends
helped
to
make
the
remembrance
still
more
vivid
all
were
friends
of
doña
sol
many
even
belonged
to
her
family
and
he
had
come
to
look
on
these
as
relations
they
all
ate
and
drank
with
that
almost
savage
voracity
usual
at
nocturnal
feasts
where
every
one
goes
with
the
fullest
intention
of
exceeding
in
everything
a
gipsy
band
stationed
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
intoning
their
somewhat
melancholy
songs
varied
by
sprightly
dance
music
added
to
the
general
hilarity
by
midnight
all
were
more
or
less
tipsy
but
gallardo
in
his
cups
was
sad
and
gloomy
ay
for
that
other
one
for
the
real
gold
of
her
hair
the
golden
hair
of
these
women
was
artificial
their
skin
was
thick
and
coarse
hardened
by
cosmetics
and
through
all
their
perfumes
his
imagination
detected
an
atmosphere
of
innate
vulgarity
ay
for
that
other
one
that
other
one
gallardo
drank
deeper
and
deeper
and
the
women
who
had
quarrelled
for
a
place
by
his
side
finding
him
dull
and
unresponsive
now
turned
their
backs
with
insulting
taunts
on
his
gloom
the
guitarists
scarcely
played
any
longer
but
overcome
with
wine
bent
drowsily
over
their
instruments
the
torero
was
also
nearly
falling
asleep
on
a
bench
when
one
of
his
friends
offered
to
give
him
a
lift
home
in
his
carriage
he
was
obliged
to
leave
early
so
as
to
be
home
before
the
old
countess
his
mother
arose
to
hear
mass
as
she
did
daily
at
dawn
the
night
wind
did
not
disperse
the
torero
drunkenness
when
his
friend
dropped
him
at
the
corner
of
his
own
street
gallardo
turned
with
unsteady
steps
towards
his
house
close
to
the
door
he
stopped
leaning
against
the
wall
with
both
hands
resting
his
head
on
his
arms
as
though
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
weight
of
his
thoughts
he
had
completely
forgotten
his
friends
the
supper
at
eritana
and
the
painted
strangers
who
had
begun
by
quarrelling
for
him
and
who
had
ended
by
insulting
him
some
memory
of
the
other
one
still
floated
through
his
mind
that
always
but
vaguely
and
at
last
that
too
faded
now
his
thoughts
by
one
of
the
capricious
turns
of
drunkenness
were
entirely
filled
by
memories
of
the
he
was
the
first
matador
in
the
world
olé
so
his
manager
and
his
friends
declared
and
it
was
the
truth
his
enemies
would
see
a
fine
sight
when
he
returned
to
the
plaza
what
had
happened
the
other
day
was
only
an
accident
a
trick
that
bad
luck
had
played
him
proud
of
the
overpowering
strength
that
the
excitement
of
wine
had
momentarily
given
him
he
imagined
all
the
andalusian
and
castillian
bulls
to
be
like
feeble
goats
that
he
could
overthrow
with
a
single
blow
from
his
hand
what
had
happened
the
other
day
was
really
nothing
rubbish
as
el
nacional
said
from
the
best
singer
there
sometimes
escapes
a
and
this
proverb
heard
from
the
lips
of
many
venerable
patriarchs
of
his
profession
on
days
of
disaster
inspired
him
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
sing
to
fill
the
silence
of
the
street
with
his
voice
with
his
head
still
leaning
on
his
arms
he
began
to
croon
a
verse
of
his
own
composition
one
of
overweening
praise
of
his
own
merit
i
am
juaniyo
gallardo
who
has
more
c
c
courage
than
god
and
being
unable
to
improvise
more
in
his
own
honour
he
repeated
the
same
words
again
and
again
in
a
hoarse
and
monotonous
voice
which
disturbed
the
silence
and
made
an
invisible
dog
at
the
end
of
the
street
bark
it
was
the
paternal
inheritance
springing
up
afresh
in
him
that
singing
mania
which
had
always
accompanied
señor
juan
in
his
weekly
outbreaks
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
garabato
pushed
out
his
sleepy
head
to
have
a
look
at
the
toper
whose
voice
he
thought
he
recognised
ah
is
that
you
said
the
espada
wait
a
bit
while
i
sing
the
last
and
he
repeated
several
times
the
incomplete
ditty
in
honour
of
his
own
bravery
till
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
into
the
house
he
felt
no
desire
to
go
to
bed
guessing
his
condition
he
put
off
the
time
when
he
would
have
to
go
up
to
his
own
room
where
carmen
would
probably
be
awake
and
waiting
for
him
go
to
sleep
garabato
i
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
but
he
was
attracted
by
the
look
of
his
office
with
its
decoration
of
portraits
frontals
won
from
bulls
and
placards
proclaiming
his
fame
when
the
electric
light
was
turned
on
and
the
servant
moved
away
gallardo
stood
swaying
unsteadily
on
his
legs
in
the
middle
of
the
room
casting
admiring
glances
over
the
walls
as
though
he
were
contemplating
for
the
first
time
this
museum
of
his
triumphs
very
good
very
good
indeed
he
murmured
that
handsome
fellow
is
me
and
that
other
one
too
all
of
them
and
yet
some
people
say
of
me
curse
it
all
i
am
the
first
man
in
the
world
don
josé
says
so
and
he
speaks
the
truth
he
threw
his
sombrero
on
to
a
divan
as
if
he
were
divesting
himself
of
a
glorious
crown
which
oppressed
his
brow
and
went
staggering
to
lean
with
both
hands
on
the
writing
bureau
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
enormous
bull
head
which
decorated
the
further
end
of
the
office
hola
good
night
my
fine
fellow
what
are
you
doing
here
muu
muu
he
saluted
the
head
with
bellowings
imitating
childishly
the
lowing
of
the
bulls
on
their
pastures
and
in
the
plaza
he
did
not
recognize
it
he
could
not
remember
why
the
shaggy
head
with
its
threatening
horns
should
be
there
but
by
degrees
the
memory
came
back
to
him
i
know
you
rascal
i
remember
how
you
made
me
rage
that
afternoon
the
crowd
whistled
at
me
and
pelted
me
with
bottles
they
even
insulted
my
poor
mother
and
you
you
were
so
pleased
how
you
did
enjoy
it
eh
shameless
one
his
drunken
glance
thought
he
saw
the
brightly
varnished
muzzle
twitch
and
the
glass
eyes
flash
with
peals
of
concentrated
laughter
he
even
thought
that
the
horned
head
was
nodding
an
acknowledgment
to
his
question
the
drunken
man
up
to
now
smiling
and
good
humoured
suddenly
felt
his
anger
rise
at
the
remembrance
of
that
afternoon
disgrace
and
was
that
evil
beast
still
laughing
at
it
those
bulls
with
perverse
minds
so
cunning
and
reflective
were
the
evil
causes
of
a
worthy
man
being
insulted
and
turned
into
ridicule
ay
how
gallardo
hated
them
what
a
glance
of
hatred
was
his
as
he
fixed
it
on
the
glassy
eyes
of
the
horned
head
are
you
still
laughing
you
son
of
a
dog
curse
you
rascal
cursed
be
the
dam
that
bore
you
and
the
thief
your
master
who
grazed
you
on
the
pastures
would
to
god
he
were
in
jail
are
you
still
laughing
still
making
grimaces
at
me
impelled
by
his
ungovernable
rage
he
leant
over
the
desk
and
stretching
out
his
arm
opened
a
drawer
then
he
drew
himself
up
erect
and
raised
one
hand
towards
the
head
pum
pum
two
revolver
shots
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
one
of
the
electric
globes
was
smashed
to
fragments
and
in
the
bull
forehead
a
round
black
hole
appeared
surrounded
by
singed
hair

a

like
the

viii
in
the
middle
of
spring
the
temperature
suddenly
fell
with
the
violent
extremes
of
the
uncertain
and
fickle
madrid
climate
it
was
very
cold
a
grey
sky
poured
down
torrents
of
rain
mingled
with
flakes
of
snow
and
people
who
were
already
dressed
in
their
light
clothes
opened
boxes
and
cupboards
in
search
of
cloaks
and
wraps
for
two
weeks
there
had
been
no
function
in
the
plaza
de
toros
the
sunday
corrida
had
been
fixed
for
the
first
weekday
on
which
it
should
be
fine
the
manager
the
employés
of
the
plaza
and
the
innumerable
amateurs
whom
this
enforced
inaction
put
out
of
temper
watched
the
sky
with
the
anxiety
of
peasants
who
are
fearing
for
their
harvest
a
slight
rent
in
the
sky
or
the
appearance
of
a
few
stars
as
they
left
their
cafés
at
midnight
raised
their
spirits
the
weather
is
lifting
we
shall
have
a
corrida
the
day
after
but
the
clouds
rolled
together
again
and
the
leaden
sky
continued
to
pour
down
its
torrents
the
aficionados
were
furious
with
the
weather
which
seemed
to
have
set
itself
against
the
national
sport
horrid
climate
which
made
even
corridas
impossible
gallardo
had
therefore
a
fortnight
of
enforced
rest
his
cuadrilla
complained
bitterly
of
the
inaction
in
any
other
town
in
spain
the
men
would
have
resigned
themselves
to
the
detention
because
the
espada
paid
all
their
hotel
expenses
in
every
place
but
madrid
it
was
a
bad
custom
initiated
by
former
maestros
living
near
the
capital
it
was
supposed
that
the
proper
domicile
of
every
real
torero
was
in
la
corte
and
the
poor
peons
and
picadors
who
lodged
in
a
kept
by
the
widow
of
a
banderillero
eked
out
their
existence
by
all
sorts
of
petty
economies
smoking
but
little
and
standing
outside
the
café
doors
they
thought
of
their
families
with
the
avarice
of
men
who
only
receive
a
few
coins
in
exchange
for
their
blood
by
the
time
these
two
corridas
had
come
off
they
would
already
have
devoured
their
earnings
in
anticipation
the
espada
was
equally
in
the
solitude
of
his
hotel
not
on
account
of
the
weather
but
on
account
of
his
ill
luck
he
had
fought
his
first
corrida
in
madrid
with
deplorable
results
and
the
public
were
quite
different
to
him
he
still
had
many
partizans
of
unquenchable
faith
who
rose
in
arms
for
his
defence
but
even
those
enthusiasts
so
noisy
and
aggressive
the
previous
year
now
showed
a
certain
reserve
and
when
they
found
occasion
to
applaud
him
they
did
so
timidly
on
the
other
hand
his
enemies
and
the
great
mass
of
the
populace
always
anxious
for
danger
and
death
how
unjust
they
were
in
their
judgments
how
ready
to
insult
him
what
was
tolerated
in
other
matadors
seemed
vetoed
for
him
they
had
seen
him
full
of
courage
throwing
himself
blindly
into
danger
and
so
they
wished
him
to
be
always
till
death
should
cut
short
his
career
he
had
played
almost
suicidally
with
fate
when
he
was
anxious
to
make
a
name
for
himself
and
now
people
could
not
reconcile
themselves
to
his
prudence
insults
were
always
hurled
at
any
attempt
at
self
preservation
as
certainly
as
he
spread
the
muleta
at
a
certain
distance
from
the
bull
so
certainly
the
protests
broke
forth
he
did
not
throw
himself
on
the
bull
he
was
afraid
and
it
was
sufficient
for
him
to
throw
himself
one
step
back
for
the
people
to
greet
this
precaution
with
filthy
insults
the
news
of
what
had
happened
in
seville
at
the
easter
corrida
seemed
to
have
circulated
throughout
spain
his
enemies
were
taking
their
revenge
for
long
years
of
envy
and
jealousy
his
professional
companions
whom
he
had
often
forced
into
danger
from
a
feeling
of
emulation
now
babbled
with
hypocritical
expressions
of
pity
about
gallardo
decadence
his
courage
had
given
out
his
last
cogida
had
made
him
over
prudent
and
the
audience
influenced
by
these
rumours
now
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
torero
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
plaza
predisposed
to
find
anything
he
did
bad
just
as
previously
they
had
applauded
even
his
faults
the
fickleness
so
characteristic
of
mobs
had
much
to
say
to
this
change
of
opinion
the
people
were
tired
of
watching
gallardo
courage
and
now
they
enjoyed
watching
his
fear
or
his
prudence
as
if
it
made
themselves
the
braver
the
public
never
thought
he
was
close
enough
to
his
bull
he
must
throw
himself
better
on
it
and
when
he
overcoming
by
sheer
strength
of
will
that
nervousness
which
longed
to
fly
from
danger
had
succeeded
in
killing
a
bull
as
in
former
days
the
ovation
was
neither
so
prolonged
nor
so
vehement
he
seemed
to
have
broken
the
current
of
enthusiasm
which
had
formerly
existed
between
himself
and
the
populace
his
scanty
triumphs
only
served
to
make
the
people
worry
him
with
lectures
and
advice
that
was
the
way
to
kill
you
ought
always
to
kill
like
that
great
cheat
his
faithful
partizans
recognized
his
failures
but
they
excused
them
speaking
of
the
former
exploits
performed
by
the
espada
on
his
lucky
afternoons
he
is
somewhat
over
careful
they
said
he
seems
tired
but
when
he
wishes
ay
but
gallardo
always
wished
why
could
he
not
do
well
and
gain
the
applause
of
the
populace
but
his
successes
that
the
aficionados
thought
a
caprice
of
his
will
were
really
the
work
of
chance
or
of
a
happy
conjunction
of
circumstances
of
that
of
the
olden
days
which
now
he
so
very
seldom
felt
in
many
of
the
provincial
plazas
he
had
been
whistled
the
people
on
the
sunny
side
insulted
him
by
the
tooting
of
horns
and
the
ringing
of
cow
bells
whenever
he
delayed
in
killing
a
bull
by
giving
it
estocades
which
did
not
make
it
bend
its
knees
in
madrid
the
people
waited
for
him
with
their
claws
as
he
said
as
soon
as
the
spectators
of
the
first
corrida
saw
him
pass
the
bull
with
the
muleta
and
enter
to
kill
the
row
broke
out
that
lad
from
seville
had
been
changed
that
was
not
gallardo
it
was
some
one
else
he
shortened
his
arm
he
turned
away
his
face
he
ran
with
the
quickness
of
a
squirrel
putting
himself
out
of
reach
of
the
bull
horns
without
the
calmness
to
stand
quietly
and
wait
for
him
they
noted
a
deplorable
loss
of
courage
and
strength
that
corrida
was
a
fiasco
for
gallardo
and
in
the
evening
assemblies
of
the
aficionados
the
affair
was
much
canvassed
the
old
people
who
thought
everything
in
the
present
day
was
bad
spoke
of
the
cowardice
of
modern
toreros
they
presented
themselves
with
mad
daring
but
as
soon
as
they
felt
the
touch
of
a
horn
on
their
flesh
they
were
done
for
gallardo
obliged
to
rest
in
consequence
of
the
bad
weather
waited
impatiently
for
the
second
corrida
with
the
fullest
intention
of
performing
great
exploits
he
was
much
pained
at
the
wound
inflicted
on
his
by
the
ridicule
of
his
enemies
if
he
returned
to
the
provinces
with
the
bad
reputation
of
a
fiasco
in
madrid
he
was
a
lost
man
he
would
master
his
nervousness
vanquish
that
dread
which
made
him
shrink
and
fancy
the
bulls
larger
and
more
formidable
he
considered
his
strength
quite
equal
to
accomplish
the
same
deeds
as
before
it
was
true
there
still
remained
a
slight
weakness
in
his
arm
and
in
his
leg
but
that
would
soon
pass
off
his
manager
suggested
his
accepting
a
very
advantageous
contract
for
certain
plazas
in
america
but
he
refused
no
he
could
not
cross
the
seas
at
present
he
must
first
show
spain
that
he
was
the
same
espada
as
heretofore
afterwards
he
would
consider
the
propriety
of
undertaking
that
journey
with
the
anxiety
of
a
popular
man
who
feels
his
prestige
broken
gallardo
frequented
the
places
where
all
the
aficionados
assembled
he
went
often
to
the
café
ingles
which
the
partisans
of
the
andalusian
toreros
frequented
thinking
his
presence
would
silence
all
unpleasant
remarks
he
himself
modest
and
smiling
began
the
conversation
with
a
humility
that
disarmed
even
the
most
irreconcilable
it
is
quite
certain
i
did
not
do
well
i
quite
recognize
it
but
you
will
see
at
the
next
corrida
when
the
weather
clears
i
will
do
what
i
can
he
did
not
dare
to
enter
certain
cafés
in
the
puerta
del
sol
where
aficionados
of
a
lower
class
assembled
they
were
madrileños
inimical
to
andalusian
and
resentful
that
all
the
matadors
came
from
seville
and
cordoba
while
the
capital
seemed
unable
to
produce
a
glorious
representative
the
remembrance
of
frascuelo
whom
they
considered
a
son
of
madrid
lived
everlastingly
in
those
assemblies
many
of
them
had
not
been
to
the
plaza
for
years
not
in
fact
since
the
retirement
of
el
negro
why
should
they
they
were
quite
content
to
read
the
reports
in
the
papers
being
convinced
that
since
frascuelo
death
there
were
neither
bulls
nor
toreros
andalusian
lads
and
nothing
more
dancers
who
made
grimaces
with
their
capes
and
their
bodies
but
did
not
know
how
to
stand
and
receive
a
bull
with
dignity
now
and
again
a
slight
breath
of
hope
revived
them
madrid
was
soon
going
to
have
its
own
great
matador
they
had
discovered
in
the
suburbs
a
novillero
who
had
already
done
good
work
in
the
plazas
of
vallecas
and
tetuan
and
had
fought
in
the
madrid
plaza
at
the
cheap
sunday
afternoon
corridas
his
name
was
becoming
popular
in
all
the
barbers
shops
the
greatest
triumphs
were
predicted
for
him
but
somehow
or
other
those
prophecies
were
never
fulfilled
either
the
aspirant
fell
a
victim
to
a
mortal
cogida
or
dropped
into
being
one
of
the
loafers
in
the
plaza
del
sol
who
aired
their
pigtails
while
they
waited
for
imaginary
contracts
and
the
aficionados
were
free
to
turn
their
attention
to
other
rising
stars
gallardo
did
not
dare
to
approach
the
tauromachic
demagogy
whom
he
knew
had
always
hated
him
and
were
rejoicing
at
his
decadence
most
of
them
would
not
go
to
see
him
in
the
circus
nor
admire
any
torero
of
the
present
day
their
expected
messiah
must
arrive
before
they
returned
to
the
plaza
in
order
to
distract
his
mind
gallardo
would
wander
in
the
evenings
through
the
puerta
del
sol
and
allow
himself
to
be
accosted
by
those
vagabonds
who
assembled
there
boasting
of
their
exploits
they
were
all
smart
well
dressed
with
a
marvellous
display
of
imitation
jewellery
they
all
saluted
him
respectfully
as
maestro
or
seño
juan
some
were
honest
fellows
enough
who
hoped
to
make
a
name
for
themselves
and
maintain
their
families
by
something
more
than
workmen
wages
others
were
less
scrupulous
but
all
ended
by
borrowing
a
few
pesetas
from
him
in
addition
to
the
amusement
offered
by
those
toreros
he
was
much
diverted
by
the
importunity
of
an
admirer
who
pestered
him
with
his
projects
this
man
was
a
at
las
ventas
a
rough
galician
of
powerful
build
and
who
had
made
a
little
fortune
in
his
shop
where
soldiers
and
servants
went
to
dance
on
sundays
he
had
only
one
son
small
of
stature
and
feeble
in
constitution
whom
his
father
destined
to
be
one
of
the
great
lights
of
tauromachia
the
a
great
admirer
of
gallardo
and
of
all
celebrated
espadas
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
this
the
lad
is
worth
something
he
said
you
know
señor
juan
that
i
understand
something
about
these
matters
and
i
am
quite
willing
to
spend
a
bit
of
money
to
give
him
a
profession
but
he
wants
a
if
he
is
to
be
pushed
and
there
could
be
no
one
better
than
yourself
if
you
would
only
arrange
a
novillada
in
which
the
youngster
could
kill
crowds
of
people
would
go
and
i
would
bear
all
the
expenses
this
readiness
to
bear
all
the
expenses
to
help
the
lad
on
in
his
career
had
already
caused
the
heavy
losses
but
he
still
persisted
being
supported
by
that
commercial
spirit
which
made
him
overlook
the
failures
in
the
hope
of
the
enormous
gains
his
son
would
make
when
he
was
a
matador
the
poor
boy
who
in
his
early
years
had
shown
a
passion
for
like
most
boys
of
his
class
now
found
himself
a
prisoner
to
his
father
tyrannical
will
the
latter
had
thoroughly
believed
in
his
vocation
thinking
the
boy
want
of
dash
laziness
and
his
fear
want
of
enterprise
a
cloud
of
parasites
low
class
amateurs
obscure
toreros
whose
only
remembrances
of
the
past
were
their
pigtails
who
drank
gratuitously
at
the
expense
and
begged
small
loans
in
return
for
their
advice
formed
a
kind
of
deliberative
assembly
whose
object
was
to
make
known
to
the
world
this
star
now
lying
hidden
in
las
ventas
the
without
consulting
his
son
had
organized
corridas
in
tetuan
and
vallecas
always
bearing
all
the
expenses
these
outlying
plazas
were
open
to
all
those
who
wished
to
be
gored
or
trampled
by
bulls
under
the
eyes
of
a
few
hundred
spectators
but
those
amusements
were
not
to
be
had
for
nothing
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
being
rolled
over
in
the
sand
to
have
his
breeches
torn
to
rags
and
his
body
covered
with
blood
and
dirt
it
was
necessary
to
pay
for
all
the
seats
in
the
plaza
the
diestro
or
his
representative
undertaking
to
distribute
the
tickets
the
enthusiastic
father
filled
all
the
places
with
his
friends
distributing
the
entrances
amongst
comrades
of
the
guild
or
poor
amateurs
of
the
sport
moreover
he
paid
those
who
formed
his
cuadrilla
lavishly
all
vagabonds
peons
and
banderilleros
recruited
from
among
the
loafers
in
the
puerta
del
sol
who
fought
in
their
everyday
clothes
whereas
the
youngster
was
resplendent
in
his
gala
costume
anything
for
the
lad
career
he
has
a
new
gala
dress
made
by
the
best
tailor
who
dresses
gallardo
and
the
other
matadors
seven
thousand
reals
it
cost
me
i
think
he
ought
to
be
fine
in
that
but
i
would
spend
my
last
peseta
to
get
him
on
ah
if
others
had
a
father
like
me
the
stood
between
the
barriers
during
the
corrida
encouraging
the
espada
by
his
presence
and
by
the
flourishing
of
a
big
stick
whenever
the
youngster
came
to
rest
by
the
wall
the
fat
red
face
of
his
father
and
the
big
knob
of
that
terrible
stick
would
appear
like
terrifying
phantoms
do
you
think
i
am
spending
my
money
for
this
why
are
you
here
giving
yourself
airs
and
graces
like
a
young
lady
have
some
dash
and
enterprise
rascal
go
out
into
the
middle
and
distinguish
yourself
ay
if
i
were
only
your
age
and
not
so
stout
when
the
poor
lad
stood
opposite
the
novillo
the
muleta
and
rapier
in
his
hands
with
pale
face
and
trembling
legs
his
father
followed
all
his
evolutions
from
behind
the
barrier
he
was
always
before
the
eyes
like
a
threatening
master
ready
to
chastise
the
slightest
fault
in
the
lesson
what
the
poor
diestro
dressed
in
his
suit
of
gold
and
red
silk
most
feared
was
his
return
home
on
the
evenings
when
his
father
was
frowning
and
dissatisfied
he
would
enter
the
tavern
wrapping
himself
in
his
rich
and
glittering
cape
to
hide
the
rags
of
shirt
protruding
through
rents
in
his
breeches
all
his
bones
aching
with
tosses
the
young
bulls
had
given
him
his
mother
a
rough
woman
upset
by
her
anxious
wait
would
run
to
meet
him
open
armed
here
this
coward
roared
the
he
is
worse
than
a
and
it
is
for
this
that
i
have
spent
money
the
terrible
stick
was
raised
furiously
and
the
golden
suited
lad
who
just
before
had
murdered
two
poor
little
bulls
endeavoured
to
run
away
shielding
his
face
with
his
arm
while
his
mother
interposed
between
the
two
do
you
see
he
is
wounded
wounded
exclaimed
the
father
bitterly
regretting
it
was
not
the
case
that
is
for
toreros
put
a
few
stitches
in
his
rags
and
see
they
are
washed
just
see
how
they
have
served
the
cheat
but
in
a
few
days
the
had
recovered
his
equanimity
anybody
might
have
a
bad
day
he
had
seen
famous
matadors
in
just
as
bad
case
before
the
public
as
his
boy
and
he
forthwith
arranged
fresh
corridas
in
toledo
and
guadalajara
he
as
before
paying
all
the
expenses
his
novillada
in
the
madrid
plaza
was
according
to
the
one
of
the
most
splendid
on
record
the
espada
by
a
lucky
accident
had
killed
two
young
bulls
moderately
well
and
the
public
who
for
the
most
part
had
entered
free
applauded
the
son
as
he
came
out
of
the
plaza
his
father
appeared
at
the
head
of
a
noisy
troup
of
loafers
whom
he
had
collected
from
all
round
the
neighbourhood
the
was
an
honest
man
in
his
dealings
and
he
had
promised
to
pay
them
fifty
centimes
a
head
if
they
would
shout
vive
el
manitas
till
they
were
hoarse
and
carry
the
glorious
novillero
on
their
shoulders
as
soon
as
he
came
out
of
the
circus
el
manitas
still
trembling
from
his
recent
perils
found
himself
surrounded
seized
and
lifted
on
to
the
shoulders
of
the
noisy
loafers
and
carried
in
triumph
from
the
plaza
to
las
ventas
through
the
calle
de
alcala
followed
by
the
inquisitive
looks
of
the
people
on
the
tramways
which
remorselessly
cut
through
the
glorious
manifestation
the
father
walked
along
with
his
stick
under
his
arm
pretending
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
whenever
the
shouting
slackened
he
forgot
himself
and
ran
to
the
head
of
the
crowd
like
a
man
who
does
not
think
he
is
getting
his
money
worth
himself
giving
the
signal
viva
manitas
when
the
ovation
would
recommence
with
tremendous
shouting
many
months
had
passed
and
the
was
still
excited
as
he
remembered
the
affair
they
brought
him
back
to
the
house
on
their
shoulders
señor
juan
just
the
same
as
they
have
often
carried
you
forgive
me
the
comparison
you
will
see
if
the
youngster
is
not
worth
something
he
only
wants
a
push
for
you
to
give
him
a
helping
so
gallardo
to
free
himself
answered
promising
vaguely
possibly
he
might
manage
to
direct
the
novillada
but
they
could
settle
that
later
on
there
was
still
plenty
of
time
before
winter
one
evening
at
dusk
as
the
torero
was
entering
the
calle
de
alcala
through
the
puerta
del
sol
he
gave
a
start
of
surprise
a
lady
was
getting
out
of
a
carriage
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
de
paris
doña
sol
a
man
who
looked
like
a
foreigner
gave
her
his
hand
to
descend
and
after
speaking
a
few
words
walked
away
while
she
entered
the
hotel
it
was
doña
sol
the
torero
could
have
no
doubt
on
that
point
neither
could
he
have
any
doubt
as
to
the
relations
subsisting
between
her
and
the
stranger
so
she
had
looked
at
him
so
she
had
smiled
on
him
in
those
happy
days
when
they
rode
together
over
the
lonely
country
in
the
crimson
light
of
the
setting
sun
curse
him
he
spent
an
uncomfortable
evening
with
some
friends
and
afterwards
slept
badly
his
dreams
reproducing
many
scenes
of
the
past
when
he
awoke
the
dull
grey
light
was
coming
in
through
the
window
rain
mingled
with
snow
was
pouring
down
in
torrents
everything
looked
black
the
sky
the
opposite
walls
the
muddy
pavement
the
umbrellas
even
the
smart
carriages
rattling
along
eleven
suppose
he
went
to
see
doña
sol
why
not
the
night
before
he
had
angrily
rejected
this
thought
it
would
be
lowering
himself
she
had
gone
away
without
any
explanation
and
afterwards
knowing
him
to
be
in
danger
of
death
she
had
scarcely
enquired
after
him
only
a
telegram
just
at
first
not
even
a
short
letter
not
even
a
line
she
who
was
so
fond
of
writing
to
her
friends
no
he
would
not
go
to
see
her
but
his
strength
of
will
seemed
to
have
evaporated
during
the
night
why
not
he
asked
himself
once
again
he
must
see
her
again
among
all
the
women
he
had
known
she
stood
first
attracting
him
with
a
strength
quite
different
from
anything
he
felt
for
the
others
ay
how
much
he
had
felt
that
sudden
separation
his
cruel
cogida
in
the
plaza
of
seville
had
cut
short
his
amorous
pique
afterwards
his
illness
and
his
tender
approximation
to
carmen
during
his
convalescence
had
resigned
him
to
his
misfortune
but
to
forget
her
that
never
he
had
done
his
best
to
forget
the
past
but
any
slight
circumstance
a
lady
on
horseback
galloping
past
a
englishwoman
in
the
street
the
constant
intercourse
with
all
those
young
men
who
were
her
relations
everything
recalled
the
image
of
doña
sol
ay
that
woman
never
should
he
meet
her
like
again
losing
her
gallardo
seemed
to
have
gone
back
in
his
life
he
was
no
longer
the
same
he
even
attributed
to
her
desertion
his
fiascos
in
his
art
when
he
had
her
he
was
braver
but
when
the
gachi
left
him
his
ill
luck
began
he
firmly
believed
that
if
she
returned
his
glorious
days
would
also
come
back
his
superstitious
heart
believed
this
most
firmly
possibly
his
longing
to
see
her
was
a
happy
inspiration
like
those
which
had
so
often
carried
him
on
to
glory
in
the
circus
again
why
not
possibly
doña
sol
seeing
him
again
after
a
long
absence
who
could
tell
the
first
time
they
had
seen
each
other
alone
together
it
had
been
so
and
so
gallardo
trusting
in
his
lucky
star
took
his
way
towards
the
hotel
de
paris
situated
at
a
short
distance
from
his
own
he
had
to
wait
nearly
half
an
hour
on
a
divan
in
the
hall
under
the
curious
eyes
of
the
hotel
employés
and
guests
who
turned
to
look
at
him
as
they
heard
his
name
finally
a
servant
showed
him
into
the
lift
and
took
him
up
to
a
small
on
the
first
floor
from
whose
windows
he
could
see
all
the
restless
life
of
the
puerta
del
sol
at
last
a
little
door
opened
and
doña
sol
appeared
amid
a
rustling
of
silks
and
the
delicate
perfume
which
seemed
to
belong
to
her
fresh
pink
skin
radiant
in
the
beautiful
summer
time
of
her
life
gallardo
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
looking
her
up
and
down
as
one
who
had
not
forgotten
the
smallest
detail
she
was
just
the
same
as
in
seville
no
even
more
beautiful
in
his
eyes
with
the
added
temptation
of
her
long
absence
she
was
dressed
in
much
the
same
elegant
negligé
with
the
same
strange
jewels
as
on
the
night
when
he
had
first
seen
her
with
gold
embroidered
papouches
on
her
pretty
feet
she
stretched
out
her
hand
with
cold
amiability
how
are
you
gallardo
i
knew
you
were
in
madrid
for
i
had
seen
you
she
no
longer
used
the
familiar
tu
to
which
he
had
responded
with
the
respectful
address
of
a
lover
of
inferior
class
that
usted
which
seemed
to
make
them
equals
drove
the
torero
to
despair
he
had
wished
to
be
as
a
servant
raised
by
love
to
the
arms
of
the
great
lady
and
now
he
found
himself
treated
with
the
cold
but
courteous
consideration
of
an
ordinary
friend
she
explained
that
she
had
seen
gallardo
having
been
at
the
only
corrida
given
in
madrid
she
had
been
there
with
a
foreign
gentleman
who
wished
to
know
spanish
things
a
friend
who
was
accompanying
her
on
her
journey
but
who
was
living
at
another
hotel
gallardo
replied
by
a
nod
he
knew
that
foreigner
he
had
seen
him
with
her
there
was
a
long
silence
between
the
two
neither
knowing
what
to
say
doña
sol
was
the
first
to
break
it
she
thought
the
torero
looking
very
well
she
remembered
vaguely
having
heard
something
about
an
accident
indeed
she
was
almost
sure
that
she
had
sent
a
telegram
to
enquire
but
really
with
the
life
she
led
with
constant
changes
of
country
and
new
friendships
her
memory
was
in
such
a
state
of
confusion
she
thought
he
looked
just
the
same
as
ever
and
at
the
corrida
he
had
seemed
proud
and
strong
although
rather
unfortunate
but
she
did
not
understand
much
about
bulls
that
was
not
really
much
gallardo
felt
irritated
at
the
indifferent
tone
in
which
that
woman
made
the
enquiry
and
he
all
the
time
he
was
hovering
between
life
and
death
he
had
thought
only
of
her
with
a
roughness
born
of
indignation
he
told
her
about
his
cogida
and
his
long
convalescence
which
had
lasted
the
whole
winter
she
listened
with
feigned
interest
while
her
eyes
betrayed
utter
indifference
what
did
the
misfortune
of
that
signify
to
her
they
were
accidents
of
his
profession
and
as
such
could
be
interesting
to
himself
only
as
gallardo
spoke
of
his
convalescence
at
the
grange
his
memory
recalled
the
image
of
the
man
who
had
seen
doña
sol
and
himself
there
together
and
plumitas
do
you
remember
the
poor
fellow
they
killed
him
i
do
not
know
if
you
heard
of
it
doña
sol
also
remembered
this
vaguely
she
had
probably
read
about
it
in
one
of
the
parisian
papers
which
spoke
of
the
bandit
as
a
most
interesting
type
of
picturesque
spain
a
poor
man
said
doña
sol
indifferently
i
scarcely
remember
him
except
as
a
rough
uninteresting
peasant
from
a
distance
one
judges
things
at
their
true
value
what
i
do
remember
is
the
day
on
which
he
breakfasted
with
us
at
the
farm
gallardo
also
remembered
that
day
poor
plumitas
with
what
emotion
he
took
a
flower
offered
by
doña
sol
because
she
had
given
the
bandit
a
flower
as
she
took
leave
of
him
did
she
not
remember
doña
sol
eyes
expressed
absolute
wonder
are
you
quite
sure
she
asked
is
that
really
so
i
swear
to
you
i
remember
nothing
about
it
ay
that
sunny
land
ay
the
intoxication
of
the
picturesque
ay
the
follies
they
make
one
commit
her
exclamations
betrayed
a
kind
of
repentance
but
she
burst
out
laughing
very
possibly
that
poor
peasant
kept
that
flower
till
his
last
moment
do
you
think
so
gallardo
do
say
probably
no
one
had
ever
given
him
a
flower
in
all
his
life
it
is
quite
possible
that
that
withered
flower
may
have
been
found
on
his
body
a
mysterious
remembrance
that
no
one
could
explain
did
you
know
nothing
of
this
gallardo
did
the
papers
say
nothing
be
silent
do
say
do
not
dispel
my
illusions
so
it
ought
to
be
i
wish
it
to
be
so
poor
plumitas
how
interesting
and
i
who
had
forgotten
all
about
the
flower
i
must
tell
that
to
my
friend
who
is
thinking
of
writing
a
book
about
spanish
things
the
remembrance
of
that
friend
who
for
the
second
time
in
a
few
moments
came
up
in
the
conversation
saddened
the
torero
he
looked
fixedly
for
some
time
at
the
beautiful
woman
with
his
melancholy
moorish
eyes
which
seemed
to
beg
for
pity
doña
sol
doña
sol
murmured
he
in
despairing
accents
as
if
wishing
to
reproach
her
with
her
cruelty
what
is
the
matter
my
friend
she
asked
smiling
what
is
happening
to
you
gallardo
sat
with
his
head
bent
half
intimidated
by
the
ironical
flash
in
those
clear
eyes
shimmering
like
gold
dust
suddenly
he
sat
up
like
one
who
has
taken
a
resolution
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
doña
sol
all
over
the
world
she
answered
simply
i
am
a
bird
of
passage
in
numberless
towns
of
which
you
would
not
even
know
the
names
and
that
foreigner
who
accompanies
you
is
is
is
a
friend
she
answered
coldly
a
friend
who
has
been
kind
enough
to
accompany
me
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
know
spain
a
clever
man
who
bears
an
illustrious
name
from
here
we
shall
go
to
andalusia
when
he
has
done
seeing
the
museums
what
more
do
you
wish
to
know
this
question
so
haughtily
asked
showed
her
imperious
will
to
keep
the
torero
at
a
distance
and
to
social
distinctions
between
them
gallardo
felt
disconcerted
doña
sol
he
moaned
ingenuously
what
you
have
done
to
me
is
unpardonable
you
have
acted
very
badly
towards
me
very
badly
indeed
why
did
you
fly
without
saying
a
single
word
do
vex
yourself
like
that
gallardo
what
i
did
was
a
very
good
thing
for
you
do
you
not
even
yet
know
me
well
enough
could
one
not
get
tired
of
that
time
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
fly
from
women
of
my
character
it
is
suicidal
for
a
man
to
fall
in
love
with
me
but
why
did
you
leave
persisted
gallardo
because
i
was
bored
do
i
speak
clearly
and
when
a
person
is
bored
i
think
they
have
every
right
to
escape
in
search
of
fresh
distraction
but
i
am
bored
to
death
everywhere
pity
me
but
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
exclaimed
the
torero
with
a
dramatic
earnestness
which
in
another
man
would
have
made
him
laugh
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
repeated
doña
sol
mimicking
his
voice
and
gesture
and
what
then
ay
these
egotistical
men
that
are
applauded
by
every
one
and
who
think
that
everything
was
created
for
them
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
that
is
sufficient
reason
for
you
to
love
me
in
return
but
no
señor
i
do
not
love
you
gallardo
you
are
a
friend
and
nothing
more
all
the
rest
all
that
down
in
seville
was
a
dream
a
mad
caprice
which
i
hardly
remember
and
which
you
ought
to
forget
the
torero
got
up
going
towards
her
with
outstretched
arms
in
his
ignorance
he
knew
not
what
to
say
guessing
that
his
halting
words
would
be
quite
inefficacious
in
convincing
such
a
woman
he
trusted
in
action
with
the
impulsive
vehemence
of
his
hopes
and
his
desires
he
intended
to
seize
that
woman
to
draw
her
to
him
and
dispel
with
his
warm
embrace
the
coldness
which
separated
them
but
she
with
a
simple
turn
of
her
right
hand
pushed
away
the
arms
a
flash
of
pride
and
anger
shone
in
her
eyes
and
she
drew
herself
up
aggressively
as
if
she
had
been
insulted
be
quiet
gallardo
if
you
go
on
like
this
you
will
no
longer
be
my
friend
and
i
shall
have
you
turned
out
of
the
house
the
torero
stood
humiliated
and
ashamed
some
time
passed
in
silence
until
at
last
doña
sol
seemed
to
pity
him
do
not
be
a
child
she
said
what
is
the
use
of
remembering
what
is
no
longer
possible
why
think
of
me
you
have
your
wife
who
i
am
told
is
both
pretty
and
good
a
kind
companion
if
not
her
then
others
there
are
plenty
of
girls
down
in
seville
who
would
think
it
happiness
to
be
loved
by
gallardo
my
love
is
ended
as
a
famous
man
accustomed
to
success
your
pride
is
hurt
but
it
is
so
mine
is
ended
you
are
a
friend
and
nothing
more
i
am
quite
different
i
am
bored
and
i
never
retrace
my
steps
illusions
only
last
with
me
a
short
time
and
pass
leaving
no
trace
i
am
to
be
pitied
believe
me
she
looked
at
the
torero
with
commiserating
eyes
as
if
she
suddenly
saw
all
his
defects
and
roughness
i
think
things
that
you
could
not
understand
she
went
on
you
seem
to
me
different
the
gallardo
in
seville
was
not
the
same
as
the
one
here
are
you
the
same
i
can
not
doubt
it
but
to
me
you
are
different
how
can
this
be
explained
she
looked
through
the
window
at
the
dull
rainy
sky
at
the
wet
plaza
at
the
flakes
of
snow
and
then
she
turned
her
eyes
on
the
espada
looking
with
astonishment
at
the
long
lock
of
hair
plastered
on
his
head
at
his
clothes
his
hat
at
all
the
details
which
betrayed
his
profession
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
his
smart
and
modern
dress
to
doña
sol
the
torero
seemed
out
of
his
element
down
in
seville
gallardo
was
a
hero
the
spontaneous
product
of
a
country
here
he
seemed
like
an
actor
how
had
she
been
able
for
many
months
to
feel
love
for
that
rough
coarse
man
ay
the
surrounding
atmosphere
to
what
follies
it
drove
one
she
remembered
the
danger
in
which
she
found
herself
so
nearly
perishing
beneath
the
bull
horns
she
thought
of
that
breakfast
with
the
bandit
to
whom
she
had
listened
stupefied
with
admiration
ending
by
giving
him
a
flower
what
follies
and
how
far
off
it
all
now
seemed
of
that
past
nothing
remained
but
that
man
standing
motionless
before
her
with
his
imploring
eyes
and
his
childish
desire
to
revive
those
days
poor
man
as
if
follies
could
be
repeated
when
one
thoughts
were
cold
and
the
illusion
wanting
the
blind
enchantment
of
life
it
is
all
over
said
the
lady
we
must
forget
the
past
for
when
we
see
it
a
second
time
it
does
not
present
itself
in
the
same
colours
what
would
i
give
to
have
my
former
eyes
when
i
returned
to
spain
it
seemed
to
me
changed
you
also
are
different
from
what
i
knew
you
it
even
seemed
to
me
seeing
you
in
the
plaza
that
you
were
less
daring
that
the
people
were
less
enthusiastic
she
said
this
quite
simply
without
a
trace
of
malice
but
gallardo
thought
there
was
mocking
in
her
voice
and
bent
his
head
while
his
cheeks
coloured
curse
it
all
his
professional
anxieties
arose
again
in
his
mind
all
the
evil
which
was
happening
to
him
was
because
he
did
not
now
throw
himself
on
the
bulls
that
is
what
she
so
clearly
said
she
saw
him
as
if
he
were
another
if
he
could
only
be
the
gallardo
of
former
days
perhaps
she
would
receive
him
better
women
only
love
brave
man
but
he
was
mistaken
taking
what
was
a
caprice
dead
for
ever
to
be
a
momentary
straying
that
he
could
recall
by
strength
and
prowess
doña
sol
got
up
the
visit
had
been
a
long
one
and
the
torero
showed
no
disposition
to
leave
content
with
being
near
her
and
trusting
to
some
lucky
chance
to
bring
them
together
again
gallardo
was
obliged
to
imitate
her
she
excused
herself
under
pretext
of
going
out
she
was
expecting
her
friend
and
they
were
going
together
to
the
museum
of
the
prado
then
she
invited
him
to
breakfast
another
day
an
unceremonious
breakfast
in
her
rooms
her
friend
would
come
no
doubt
he
would
be
delighted
to
meet
a
torero
he
scarcely
spoke
any
spanish
but
all
the
same
he
would
be
pleased
to
know
gallardo
the
espada
pressed
her
hand
murmuring
some
incoherent
words
and
left
the
room
anger
dimmed
his
sight
and
his
ears
were
buzzing
so
she
dismissed
him
coldly
like
an
importunate
friend
could
that
woman
be
the
same
as
the
one
in
seville
and
she
invited
him
to
breakfast
with
her
friend
so
that
the
man
could
amuse
himself
by
examining
him
closely
like
a
rare
insect
curse
her
he
would
prove
himself
a
man
it
was
over
he
would
never
see
her
again
footnotes
madrid
is
called
la
corte
the
court
godfather
patron
chapter
ix
about
this
time
gallardo
received
several
letters
from
don
josé
and
from
carmen
the
manager
evidently
wished
to
encourage
his
matador
advising
him
as
usual
to
go
straight
at
his
bull
zas
a
thrust
and
you
put
him
in
your
pocket
but
through
his
enthusiasm
could
be
traced
a
slight
discouragement
as
if
his
perfect
faith
was
a
little
staggered
and
he
had
begun
to
doubt
if
gallardo
were
still
the
first
man
in
the
world
he
had
received
accounts
of
the
discontent
and
hostility
with
which
the
public
received
him
and
the
last
corrida
in
madrid
had
fairly
disheartened
poor
don
josé
no
gallardo
was
not
like
other
espadas
who
could
go
straight
on
through
all
the
whistling
of
the
audience
satisfied
as
long
as
they
earned
their
money
his
matador
had
genius
and
professional
pride
and
could
show
himself
off
in
a
circus
only
if
he
were
received
with
great
applause
a
mediocre
result
was
equivalent
to
a
defeat
the
people
were
accustomed
to
admire
him
for
his
reckless
audacious
courage
and
anything
that
did
not
come
up
to
that
meant
a
fiasco
don
josé
pretended
to
know
what
was
wrong
with
his
espada
want
of
courage
never
he
would
die
sooner
than
admit
that
fault
in
his
hero
it
was
that
he
felt
wearied
that
he
had
not
yet
entirely
recovered
from
the
tremendous
shock
of
his
cogida
and
for
this
reason
he
advised
in
all
his
letters
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
retire
and
rest
for
a
season
afterwards
you
can
come
back
and
fight
and
be
the
same
as
ever
and
he
offered
himself
to
make
all
necessary
arrangements
a
medical
certificate
would
be
sufficient
to
explain
his
momentary
inaction
and
he
would
come
to
some
agreement
as
to
all
pending
contracts
with
the
managers
of
the
different
plazas
by
which
gallardo
would
supply
a
rising
torero
to
fill
his
place
at
a
moderate
salary
so
by
this
means
he
would
still
be
making
money
carmen
was
the
most
earnest
in
her
persuasions
using
none
of
the
manager
circumlocutions
he
ought
to
retire
at
once
he
ought
to
cut
off
his
pigtail
as
they
said
in
his
profession
and
spend
his
life
quietly
at
la
rinconada
or
in
his
house
in
seville
with
his
family
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
her
heart
told
her
with
that
feminine
instinct
which
seldom
erred
that
something
serious
would
occur
she
could
scarcely
sleep
and
she
dreaded
the
night
hours
peopled
with
bloody
visions
then
she
wrote
furiously
against
the
public
an
ungrateful
crowd
who
had
already
forgotten
what
the
torero
had
done
when
he
was
in
his
full
strength
bad
hearted
people
who
wished
to
see
him
die
for
their
own
amusement
as
if
he
had
neither
wife
nor
mother
juan
the
little
mother
and
i
both
beg
of
you
to
retire
why
go
on
we
have
enough
to
live
on
and
it
pains
me
to
hear
these
people
insulting
you
who
are
not
worthy
of
you
suppose
another
accident
happened
to
you
jesus
i
think
i
should
go
mad
gallardo
was
very
thoughtful
for
some
time
after
reading
these
letters
to
retire
what
nonsense
women
worries
affection
might
easily
dictate
this
but
it
was
impossible
to
carry
it
out
cut
off
his
pigtail
before
he
was
thirty
how
his
enemies
would
laugh
he
had
no
right
to
retire
as
long
as
his
limbs
were
sound
and
he
was
able
to
fight
such
an
absurdity
had
never
been
heard
of
money
was
not
everything
how
about
his
fame
and
his
professional
pride
what
would
his
thousands
and
thousands
of
admiring
partisans
say
what
could
they
reply
to
his
enemies
if
those
latter
threw
it
in
their
teeth
that
gallardo
had
retired
through
fear
besides
the
matador
paused
to
consider
if
his
fortune
would
admit
of
this
solution
he
was
rich
and
yet
he
was
not
his
social
position
was
not
yet
consolidated
what
he
possessed
was
the
result
of
his
first
few
years
of
married
life
when
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
had
been
to
surprise
his
mother
and
carmen
with
fresh
acquisitions
after
that
he
had
made
money
in
even
larger
quantities
but
it
had
run
away
and
vanished
in
a
hundred
channels
opened
out
by
his
new
life
he
had
played
high
had
led
an
expensive
and
ostentatious
life
many
farms
added
to
the
extensive
estate
of
la
rinconada
to
round
it
off
had
been
bought
by
loans
furnished
by
don
josé
or
other
friends
he
was
rich
but
if
he
retired
and
lost
the
splendid
income
from
the
corridas
often
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
pesetas
a
year
he
would
have
to
curtail
his
expenses
pay
his
debts
and
live
like
a
country
gentleman
on
the
income
from
la
rinconada
looking
after
things
himself
for
at
present
the
estate
managed
by
hirelings
produced
very
little
formerly
he
would
have
been
contented
with
a
very
small
portion
of
what
he
possessed
now
but
if
he
retired
he
would
have
to
curtail
those
havanna
cigars
which
he
now
distributed
so
lavishly
and
those
andalusian
wines
of
fine
vintage
he
would
have
to
restrain
his
lordly
generosity
and
no
longer
cry
i
pay
for
everything
as
he
entered
a
café
or
a
tavern
so
he
had
lived
and
so
he
must
go
on
living
he
was
a
torero
of
the
style
lavish
arrogant
astonishing
every
one
with
scandalous
extravagances
but
always
ready
to
help
misfortune
with
princely
generosity
he
did
not
in
the
least
regret
his
ostentatious
life
and
yet
they
wished
him
to
give
it
up
furthermore
he
thought
of
the
expenses
of
his
own
household
all
of
them
were
accustomed
to
the
easy
careless
life
of
families
with
little
regard
for
money
as
they
saw
it
constantly
flowing
in
in
streams
besides
his
mother
and
his
wife
he
provided
for
his
sister
his
loquacious
and
the
tribe
of
children
now
growing
up
and
becoming
daily
more
expensive
he
would
have
to
bring
into
ways
of
order
and
economy
all
these
people
who
had
hitherto
lived
at
his
expense
with
happy
carelessness
and
every
one
even
poor
garabato
would
have
to
go
to
the
grange
and
work
like
niggers
under
the
burning
sun
his
mother
too
would
no
longer
be
able
to
make
her
last
days
happy
by
her
kindly
generosity
to
the
poor
in
the
suburb
and
carmen
also
who
although
she
was
economical
and
tried
to
limit
expenses
would
be
the
first
to
deprive
herself
of
many
little
frivolities
which
beautified
life
curse
it
all
all
this
represented
degradation
to
the
family
and
gallardo
felt
ashamed
that
such
a
thing
could
possibly
happen
it
would
be
a
crime
to
deprive
them
of
what
they
enjoyed
now
they
had
become
accustomed
to
ease
and
comfort
and
what
ought
he
to
do
to
prevent
this
simply
to
throw
himself
on
the
bulls
fight
as
he
had
fought
in
former
days
and
he
would
throw
himself
he
replied
to
his
manager
and
to
carmen
letters
by
short
and
laboriously
written
epistles
expressing
to
both
his
firm
intention
not
to
retire
most
certainly
not
he
was
determined
to
be
what
he
had
always
been
that
he
swore
to
don
josé
he
would
follow
his
advice
zas
a
sword
thrust
and
the
bull
in
his
pocket
he
felt
his
courage
rising
and
with
it
the
capacity
of
facing
all
bulls
however
big
they
might
be
he
wrote
gaily
to
his
wife
though
his
was
rather
wounded
by
her
doubting
his
strength
she
would
soon
have
news
of
the
next
corrida
he
intended
to
astonish
the
public
so
that
they
might
be
ashamed
of
their
injustice
if
the
bulls
were
good
ones
he
would
surpass
even
roger
de
flor
himself
good
bulls
this
was
one
of
gallardo
anxieties
formerly
one
of
his
vanities
had
been
never
to
concern
himself
with
the
brutes
never
to
go
and
see
them
at
the
plaza
before
the
corrida
i
kill
anything
that
is
sent
to
me
he
said
arrogantly
and
he
saw
his
bulls
for
the
first
time
when
they
were
turned
into
the
circus
now
he
wished
to
examine
them
closely
to
choose
them
to
prepare
for
his
success
by
a
careful
study
of
their
dispositions
the
weather
had
cleared
at
last
and
the
sun
was
shining
consequently
the
second
corrida
would
take
place
on
the
following
day
that
evening
gallardo
went
alone
to
the
plaza
the
huge
red
brick
circus
with
its
moorish
windows
stood
out
against
a
background
of
low
green
hillocks
on
the
furthest
slope
of
this
wide
but
monotonous
landscape
something
lay
white
in
the
distance
which
might
be
a
herd
of
cattle
it
was
the
cemetery
as
the
matador
came
near
the
building
a
troup
of
squalid
beggars
vagabonds
who
were
allowed
to
sleep
in
the
stables
from
charity
wretches
who
lived
on
the
alms
of
the
aficionados
or
the
scraps
from
neighbouring
taverns
gathered
round
him
cap
in
hand
many
had
come
from
andalusia
with
a
consignment
of
bulls
and
had
remained
hanging
about
the
precincts
of
the
plaza
gallardo
distributed
a
few
coins
among
these
beggars
and
then
entered
the
circus
through
the
puerta
de
caballerizas
in
the
courtyard
he
saw
a
group
of
aficionados
watching
the
picadors
trying
their
horses
potaje
armed
with
his
spear
and
huge
spurs
was
just
going
to
mount
the
stable
boys
accompanied
the
contractor
who
furnished
the
horses
a
stout
man
slow
of
speech
wearing
a
large
andalusian
felt
sombrero
who
answered
with
imperturbable
calm
the
aggressive
and
insulting
loquacity
of
the
picadors
the
monos
sabios
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
brought
out
the
miserable
crocks
for
the
riders
to
try
for
several
days
they
had
been
riding
and
training
those
wretched
mounts
who
still
bore
on
their
flanks
crimson
spur
marks
they
took
them
out
to
trot
on
the
open
ground
round
the
plaza
giving
them
a
fictitious
energy
beneath
their
iron
heels
and
teaching
them
to
turn
quickly
so
as
to
become
used
to
their
work
in
the
arena
they
returned
to
the
plaza
with
their
sides
stained
with
blood
and
before
entering
the
stables
were
refreshed
with
three
or
four
of
water
close
to
the
the
water
running
in
between
the
was
dyed
red
like
poured
out
wine
these
unfortunate
animals
destined
for
corrida
were
almost
dragged
out
of
the
stables
to
be
examined
by
the
picadors
as
they
came
out
of
the
stables
depressed
remnants
of
equine
misery
they
betrayed
in
their
trembling
legs
their
heaving
flanks
their
starved
and
miserable
appearance
sad
signs
of
human
ingratitude
of
the
forgetfulness
of
past
services
there
were
hacks
of
frightful
thinness
real
skeletons
whose
sharp
and
pointed
bones
seemed
ready
to
pierce
the
covering
of
long
and
tangled
hair
others
holding
themselves
proudly
with
raised
heads
and
bright
eyes
pawing
restlessly
with
sounder
legs
and
shining
coats
animals
of
good
stamp
who
seemed
out
of
place
among
their
wretched
companions
looking
as
though
they
had
only
just
been
unharnessed
from
sumptuous
carriages
were
in
reality
more
dangerous
to
ride
as
they
were
probably
afflicted
with
vertigo
or
staggers
and
might
fall
to
the
ground
at
any
moment
pitching
their
riders
over
their
heads
and
among
these
sad
examples
of
misery
and
decrepitude
were
also
invalided
workers
from
mills
and
factories
agricultural
horses
cab
horses
all
weary
with
long
years
of
hard
work
dragging
ploughs
and
carts
unhappy
outcasts
who
were
to
be
sweated
up
to
the
last
moment
of
their
lives
diverting
the
spectators
by
their
kicks
and
bounds
of
agony
when
they
felt
the
bull
horns
pierce
their
belly
it
was
an
interminable
defile
of
bleared
and
yellow
eyes
of
galled
necks
on
which
were
battening
bright
green
flies
gorged
with
blood
of
bony
heads
whose
skin
was
swarming
with
vermin
of
narrow
chests
and
feeble
legs
covered
down
to
the
hoofs
with
hair
so
long
and
shaggy
it
looked
almost
as
though
they
were
wearing
trousers
to
mount
these
decrepit
brutes
shaking
with
fright
and
almost
ready
to
drop
with
weakness
required
almost
as
much
courage
as
to
face
the
bull
potaje
was
very
high
and
mighty
in
his
discussions
with
the
horse
contractor
speaking
in
his
own
name
and
that
of
his
comrades
as
well
making
even
the
monos
sabios
laugh
with
his
gipsy
oaths
the
other
picadors
had
far
better
leave
him
to
manage
the
no
one
knew
better
than
he
did
how
to
bring
those
sort
of
people
to
terms
a
groom
came
out
leading
a
horse
with
hanging
head
tangled
coat
and
staring
ribs
what
are
you
bringing
me
out
there
shouted
potaje
facing
the
contractor
a
crock
that
no
one
would
dream
of
mounting
the
phlegmatic
contractor
replied
with
calm
gravity
if
potaje
did
not
dare
to
mount
it
it
was
because
picadors
seemed
afraid
of
everything
with
a
horse
like
this
so
good
and
docile
señor
calderon
or
el
trigo
or
any
fine
rider
of
the
good
old
times
would
have
been
able
to
fight
for
two
successive
afternoons
without
getting
a
fall
and
without
the
animal
receiving
a
scratch
but
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
plenty
of
fear
and
very
little
dash
the
contractor
and
the
picador
abused
one
another
in
a
friendly
fashion
as
if
the
grossest
insults
had
ceased
to
have
the
slightest
meaning
you
are
an
old
cheat
roared
potaje
a
bigger
rascal
than
josé
maria
el
tempraniyo
get
out
hoist
your
grandmother
up
on
the
old
brute
a
far
better
mount
for
her
than
the
broomstick
she
rides
every
saturday
at
midnight
every
one
present
roared
with
laughter
while
the
contractor
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
the
matter
with
the
horse
he
asked
quietly
look
him
over
well
old
grumbler
he
is
far
better
than
those
that
have
glanders
or
staggers
who
have
before
now
pitched
you
over
their
heads
and
planted
you
up
to
your
ears
in
the
sand
before
you
could
face
the
bull
he
is
as
sound
as
an
apple
for
the
five
and
twenty
years
he
has
been
in
an
ærated
water
factory
doing
his
work
conscientiously
no
one
has
ever
found
fault
with
him
and
now
you
come
along
shouting
and
abusing
him
taking
away
his
character
as
if
he
were
a
bad
christian
i
wo
have
him
that
all
if
he
is
so
good
keep
him
yourself
as
he
spoke
the
contractor
came
slowly
towards
potaje
and
with
the
of
a
man
accustomed
to
such
transactions
whispered
something
in
his
ear
the
picador
pretending
to
be
very
angry
finally
went
up
to
the
horse
he
did
not
wish
to
be
thought
an
intractable
man
who
wanted
to
do
a
bad
turn
to
a
comrade
so
putting
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
let
the
whole
weight
of
his
heavy
body
fall
on
the
poor
brute
then
steadying
his
garrocha
under
his
arm
he
pushed
the
point
against
a
large
post
built
into
the
wall
striking
it
several
times
with
all
his
strength
as
if
a
large
and
heavy
bull
were
at
the
lance
point
the
poor
horse
shook
all
over
and
doubled
up
its
legs
after
each
concussion
he
does
not
behave
so
badly
said
potaje
in
a
conciliatory
voice
the
beast
is
better
than
i
thought
he
has
a
tender
mouth
and
good
legs
you
are
quite
right
put
him
on
one
side
and
the
picador
dismounted
disposed
to
accept
anything
the
contractor
offered
after
his
mysterious
whisper
gallardo
left
the
group
of
aficionados
who
were
watching
this
scene
with
amusement
a
porter
belonging
to
the
plaza
took
him
to
the
yard
in
which
the
bulls
were
enclosed
the
espada
went
through
a
little
wicket
giving
access
to
the
enclosure
which
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
wall
of
masonry
up
to
the
height
of
a
man
shoulders
this
wall
was
strengthened
at
intervals
by
strong
posts
which
supported
a
balcony
above
here
and
there
opened
little
passages
so
narrow
that
a
man
could
only
slip
through
them
sideways
in
this
courtyard
were
eight
bulls
some
quietly
lying
down
others
turning
over
the
piles
of
grass
lying
in
front
of
them
gallardo
walked
along
in
the
passage
behind
the
wall
examining
the
animals
now
and
then
he
slipped
into
the
yard
through
one
of
the
narrow
passages
he
waved
his
arms
giving
savage
yells
which
roused
the
bulls
from
their
quiescence
some
leapt
up
nervously
rushing
with
lowered
heads
at
the
man
who
ventured
to
disturb
the
peace
of
their
enclosure
others
stood
firmly
on
their
feet
with
raised
heads
and
savage
look
waiting
to
see
if
the
intruder
would
dare
to
approach
them
gallardo
slipped
away
quickly
behind
the
wall
considering
the
looks
and
disposition
of
the
fierce
creatures
without
coming
to
a
decision
as
to
which
he
should
choose
the
head
shepherd
of
the
plaza
accompanied
him
a
big
athletic
man
in
leather
gaiters
and
huge
spurs
dressed
in
a
thick
cloth
suit
his
wide
sombrero
fastened
under
his
chin
by
a
strap
he
was
nicknamed
lobato
and
was
a
roughrider
who
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
year
in
the
open
country
behaving
when
he
came
into
madrid
like
a
savage
having
no
wish
to
see
the
streets
and
in
fact
never
leaving
the
purlieus
of
the
plaza
for
him
the
capital
of
spain
was
nothing
more
than
a
plaza
in
a
clearing
with
desert
lands
surrounding
it
while
in
the
distance
lay
an
agglomeration
of
houses
which
he
had
never
had
the
curiosity
to
explore
the
most
important
establishment
in
madrid
from
his
point
of
view
was
gallina
tavern
situated
close
to
the
plaza
a
place
of
delight
an
enchanted
palace
where
he
supped
and
dined
at
the
expense
of
the
management
before
returning
to
his
pastures
mounted
on
his
horse
his
dark
blanket
on
the
saddle
bow
his
on
the
crupper
and
his
lance
over
his
shoulder
he
delighted
in
terrorising
the
servants
as
he
entered
the
tavern
by
his
friendly
greetings
terrible
hand
grips
which
crushed
their
bones
and
drew
forth
screams
of
pain
he
smiled
delighted
with
his
strength
and
being
called
a
brute
and
then
sat
down
to
his
pittance
which
was
served
him
in
a
dish
as
deep
as
a
basin
accompanied
by
more
than
one
jar
of
wine
he
herded
the
bulls
bought
by
the
management
sometimes
in
the
pastures
of
munoza
at
others
during
the
excessive
heat
on
the
grazing
uplands
of
the
sierra
de
guadarrama
he
brought
them
in
to
the
enclosure
two
days
before
the
corrida
at
midnight
driving
them
across
the
abronigal
stream
and
through
the
outskirts
of
madrid
accompanied
by
amateur
and
cowherds
he
was
rampant
when
bad
weather
prevented
a
corrida
taking
place
which
kept
the
herd
in
the
plaza
and
prevented
his
immediate
return
to
the
peaceful
solitudes
where
the
other
bulls
were
still
grazing
slow
of
speech
dull
of
thought
this
centaur
who
smelt
of
leather
and
manure
could
still
speak
eloquently
even
poetically
of
his
pastoral
life
herding
the
wild
bulls
the
sky
of
madrid
seemed
to
him
lower
and
with
fewer
stars
he
could
describe
with
picturesque
laconicism
the
nights
on
the
pastures
with
his
bulls
sleeping
beneath
the
soft
light
of
the
stars
the
dense
silence
only
broken
by
the
mysterious
noises
of
the
forest
in
this
silence
the
mountain
vipers
sang
with
strange
song
yes
señor
certainly
they
sang
it
was
a
thing
that
could
not
be
discussed
with
lobato
he
had
heard
them
a
thousand
times
and
to
doubt
it
was
to
call
him
a
cheat
and
a
liar
and
to
expose
oneself
to
the
weight
of
his
fists
as
the
reptiles
sang
so
also
did
the
bulls
speak
only
he
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
mastering
all
the
mysteries
of
their
idiom
they
were
really
just
like
christians
except
that
they
went
on
four
legs
and
had
horns
you
should
see
them
wake
when
the
sun
rose
bounding
about
as
happy
as
children
pretending
in
fun
to
cross
their
horns
and
fight
each
other
chasing
each
other
with
noisy
enjoyment
as
if
they
were
saluting
the
coming
of
the
sun
which
is
the
glory
of
god
then
he
spoke
of
his
toilsome
excursions
through
the
sierra
de
guadarrama
following
the
course
of
the
rivulets
which
brought
the
melted
snow
from
the
mountains
to
feed
the
rivers
of
the
meadows
with
their
verdure
enamelled
by
flowers
of
the
birds
who
came
fluttering
to
settle
between
the
horns
of
the
sleeping
bulls
of
the
wolves
who
howled
afar
off
in
the
night
always
far
off
for
they
feared
the
long
procession
of
wild
bulls
following
the
bells
of
the
cabestros
come
to
dispute
with
them
their
terrible
solitudes
do
let
any
one
speak
to
him
of
madrid
where
one
suffocated
the
only
good
thing
in
that
forest
of
houses
was
gallina
good
wine
and
his
savoury
stews
lobato
assisted
the
espada
with
his
advice
in
choosing
his
two
bulls
the
overseer
showed
neither
respect
nor
astonishment
at
these
celebrated
men
so
admired
by
the
populace
the
shepherd
of
the
bulls
almost
despised
the
toreros
to
kill
such
noble
animals
with
every
sort
of
trickery
and
deceit
he
was
the
really
brave
man
who
lived
among
them
passing
daily
between
their
horns
in
the
solitudes
with
no
other
defence
than
his
own
arm
and
no
thought
of
applause
as
gallardo
left
the
enclosure
another
man
joined
them
who
saluted
the
maestro
with
great
respect
it
was
the
old
man
charged
with
the
cleaning
of
the
plaza
he
had
been
a
great
many
years
in
this
employment
and
had
known
all
the
most
celebrated
toreros
of
his
day
he
was
very
poorly
dressed
but
he
often
wore
beautiful
rings
and
to
blow
his
nose
would
draw
from
the
depths
of
his
blouse
a
small
cambric
handkerchief
trimmed
with
fine
lace
and
having
a
large
monogram
still
exhaling
a
delicate
scent
he
undertook
by
himself
during
the
week
the
sweeping
of
the
immense
plaza
its
rows
of
seats
and
boxes
without
ever
complaining
of
the
overwhelming
work
if
the
manager
was
displeased
with
him
and
wished
to
punish
him
he
would
open
the
doors
to
all
the
riffraff
wandering
round
the
plaza
the
poor
man
would
be
in
despair
promising
amendment
in
order
that
this
swarm
of
people
should
not
take
over
his
work
now
and
then
he
allowed
half
a
dozen
lads
to
help
him
these
were
generally
toreros
apprentices
and
were
faithful
to
him
in
exchange
for
his
allowing
them
to
watch
the
corrida
from
the
dogs
box
that
is
a
door
with
an
iron
grating
situated
near
the
bulls
boxes
which
was
used
for
taking
out
wounded
men
these
helpers
holding
on
to
the
iron
bars
fought
like
monkeys
in
a
cage
to
obtain
first
place
the
old
man
distributed
their
weekly
cleansing
work
cleverly
enough
all
these
boys
worked
on
the
seats
of
the
sunny
side
those
occupied
by
a
poor
and
dirty
crowd
who
left
as
evidence
of
their
presence
a
rubbish
heap
of
orange
peel
scraps
of
paper
and
cigar
ends
look
out
for
the
tobacco
he
would
order
his
troup
whoever
filches
a
single
cigar
end
will
not
see
the
corrida
on
sunday
he
himself
worked
patiently
on
the
shady
side
crouching
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
boxes
to
slip
any
finds
into
his
pockets
such
as
fans
rings
coins
feminine
ornaments
anything
that
an
invasion
of
fourteen
thousand
people
might
have
left
behind
them
he
collected
the
scraps
of
cigar
ends
chopping
them
up
after
exposing
them
to
the
sun
and
selling
them
as
fine
tobacco
the
more
valuable
finds
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
dealer
willing
to
buy
these
spoils
of
a
public
either
forgetful
or
oblivious
from
excitement
gallardo
responded
to
the
old
man
obsequious
bows
by
giving
him
a
cigar
and
then
took
leave
of
lobato
he
had
agreed
with
the
overseer
which
two
bulls
should
be
specially
boxed
for
him
the
other
toreros
would
not
object
they
were
good
natured
young
fellows
full
of
youthful
ardour
who
would
kill
anything
that
was
put
before
them
as
he
came
out
again
into
the
courtyard
where
the
selection
of
horses
was
still
in
progress
gallardo
saw
a
tall
spare
man
with
olive
complexion
dressed
as
a
torero
leave
the
group
and
come
towards
him
tufts
of
hair
appeared
from
beneath
his
black
felt
hat
and
his
mouth
was
surrounded
by
many
wrinkles
pescadero
how
are
you
said
gallardo
clasping
his
hand
with
sincere
warmth
he
was
an
old
espada
who
had
had
his
youthful
days
of
triumph
but
very
few
now
even
remembered
his
name
other
matadors
coming
after
him
had
eclipsed
this
fleeting
reputation
so
pescadero
after
fighting
in
america
and
sustaining
several
cogidas
had
retired
with
a
little
capital
of
savings
gallardo
knew
that
he
owned
a
small
tavern
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
circus
but
too
far
off
for
him
to
have
many
customers
among
the
aficionados
and
toreros
i
can
not
often
come
to
the
corridas
said
pescadero
sadly
still
you
see
the
sport
draws
me
and
i
drop
in
as
a
neighbour
to
see
these
things
i
am
nothing
but
a
gallardo
looked
at
his
shabby
appearance
and
remembered
the
brilliant
pescadero
he
had
known
in
his
childhood
one
of
his
most
admired
heroes
gallant
and
proud
favoured
by
women
among
the
smartest
in
la
campana
whenever
he
came
to
seville
dressed
in
his
velvet
hat
his
wine
coloured
jacket
and
brightly
coloured
sash
leaning
on
an
ivory
stick
with
gold
handle
and
so
would
he
also
be
shabby
and
forgotten
if
he
retired
from
they
talked
a
long
time
about
things
appertaining
to
the
art
el
pescadero
like
all
elderly
men
embittered
by
bad
luck
was
pessimistic
there
were
very
few
good
toreros
there
were
no
longer
men
of
corazon
only
gallardo
and
one
or
two
others
killed
bulls
truly
even
the
animals
seemed
less
powerful
than
formerly
as
he
had
met
the
matador
he
insisted
on
his
going
with
him
to
his
house
indeed
as
an
old
friend
he
could
do
no
less
so
gallardo
turned
with
him
into
one
of
the
small
streets
surrounding
the
plaza
and
entered
the
tavern
which
was
much
like
any
other
its
façade
painted
red
windows
with
curtains
of
the
same
colour
a
larger
show
window
in
which
were
displayed
on
dusty
plates
cooked
cutlets
fried
birds
bottles
of
pickles
and
inside
a
zinc
counter
barrels
and
bottles
round
tables
with
wooden
stools
by
them
and
several
coloured
prints
representing
celebrated
toreros
or
remarkable
episodes
in
corridas
we
will
have
a
glass
of
montilla
said
el
pescadero
to
a
young
man
standing
behind
the
counter
who
smiled
as
he
saw
gallardo
the
latter
looked
at
his
face
and
then
at
his
right
sleeve
which
was
empty
and
pinned
to
his
breast
it
seems
to
me
i
know
you
said
the
matador
i
should
think
you
did
know
him
cried
pescadero
it
is
pipi
the
nickname
made
gallardo
remember
his
history
at
once
a
plucky
youngster
who
stuck
in
his
banderillas
in
most
masterly
fashion
he
also
had
been
named
by
the
aficionados
as
the
torero
of
the
future
unluckily
one
day
in
the
plaza
in
madrid
his
right
arm
had
been
so
badly
gored
as
to
make
amputation
necessary
and
he
had
been
rendered
useless
for
further
i
took
him
in
juan
continued
el
pescadero
i
have
no
family
and
my
wife
died
so
i
look
upon
him
as
a
son
do
not
think
that
pipi
and
i
live
in
plenty
we
live
as
we
can
but
whatever
i
have
is
for
him
we
get
on
thanks
to
old
friends
who
come
sometimes
to
breakfast
or
to
play
a
game
of
cards
and
above
all
thanks
to
the
school
gallardo
smiled
he
had
heard
something
about
the
school
of
tauromachia
established
by
el
pescadero
close
to
his
tavern
what
can
i
do
now
said
the
latter
excusing
himself
one
must
help
oneself
on
and
the
school
consumes
more
than
all
the
customers
in
the
tavern
a
great
many
people
come
young
gentlemen
who
wish
to
distinguish
themselves
at
the
foreigners
who
become
bewitched
by
the
corridas
and
who
wish
to
become
toreros
in
their
old
age
i
have
got
one
now
who
comes
every
afternoon
you
shall
see
him
they
crossed
the
street
towards
a
plot
of
ground
surrounded
by
a
wall
across
the
joined
planks
which
served
as
a
door
was
a
large
placard
on
which
was
written
in
tar
school
of
tauromachia
they
went
in
the
first
thing
that
attracted
gallardo
attention
was
the
bull
an
animal
made
of
wood
and
bamboos
mounted
on
wheels
with
a
tail
of
tow
a
head
of
plaited
straw
and
pieces
of
cork
for
a
neck
to
which
were
attached
a
pair
of
real
and
enormous
horns
which
struck
terror
into
the
pupils
hearts
a
lad
in
a
cap
with
two
curls
of
hair
above
his
ears
was
the
creature
who
communicated
its
intelligence
to
the
beast
pushing
it
forward
when
the
pupils
stood
opposite
to
it
with
their
capes
in
their
hands
in
the
middle
of
the
plot
stood
a
gentleman
elderly
round
shouldered
and
stout
red
faced
with
large
stiff
grey
moustache
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
banderilla
in
either
hand
close
to
the
wall
seated
on
a
chair
and
leaning
on
another
was
a
lady
of
about
the
same
age
and
not
less
stout
and
rubicund
in
a
hat
covered
with
flowers
each
time
her
husband
executed
some
good
stroke
the
piles
of
flowers
and
false
curls
shook
and
waved
wildly
as
she
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
laughing
and
applauding
loudly
el
pescadero
explained
to
gallardo
that
most
probably
those
people
were
french
or
possibly
from
some
other
country
he
was
not
certain
and
it
mattered
nothing
to
him
the
couple
seemed
to
have
travelled
all
over
the
world
and
to
have
lived
everywhere
to
judge
from
his
stories
he
had
been
a
miner
in
america
colonist
in
some
distant
island
hunter
of
wild
horses
with
a
lasso
in
america
and
now
he
wished
to
earn
some
money
as
torero
and
came
every
afternoon
to
the
school
like
an
obstinate
child
but
he
paid
generously
for
his
lessons
just
imagine
a
torero
with
that
figure
and
at
fifty
years
of
age
well
struck
as
he
saw
the
two
men
enter
the
pupil
dropped
his
arms
holding
the
banderillas
and
the
lady
arranged
her
skirts
and
her
flowery
hat
ah
dear
master
good
evening
mosiu
your
servant
madame
said
the
master
raising
his
hand
to
his
hat
let
me
see
mosiu
how
this
lesson
is
getting
on
you
remember
what
i
told
you
stand
quiet
on
your
ground
invite
the
let
him
come
and
when
he
is
by
your
side
just
bend
your
hips
and
stick
the
darts
in
his
neck
you
need
not
be
anxious
to
do
anything
the
bull
will
do
everything
for
you
attention
are
you
ready
and
the
professor
standing
a
little
aside
made
a
sign
to
the
terrible
bull
or
more
properly
to
the
urchin
who
with
his
hands
on
the
hind
quarters
was
pushing
him
to
the
attack
eeeeh
enter
morito
pescadero
gave
a
fearful
bellow
to
induce
the
bull
to
enter
exciting
by
those
shouts
and
furious
stamping
on
the
ground
this
terrible
beast
with
inside
of
air
and
reeds
and
head
of
straw
monto
attacked
like
a
furious
wild
beast
with
a
tremulous
rattle
of
wheels
staggering
and
butting
on
account
of
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
how
could
any
bull
from
the
most
famous
herd
compare
in
intelligence
with
this
morito
immortal
beast
who
had
been
pierced
with
banderillas
and
rapier
thrusts
a
thousand
times
only
suffering
insignificant
wounds
that
the
carpenter
had
been
able
to
cure
he
seemed
cleverer
than
any
man
as
he
came
near
to
the
pupil
he
slightly
changed
his
course
in
order
not
to
touch
him
with
his
horns
going
off
with
a
pair
of
darts
well
stuck
into
his
cork
neck
a
perfect
ovation
greeted
this
exploit
the
banderillero
remaining
firm
in
his
place
arranging
his
braces
and
his
shirt
cuffs
his
wife
wildly
delighted
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
laughing
and
clapping
quite
masterly
mosiu
shouted
el
pescadero
a
stroke
of
the
first
quality
the
foreigner
delighted
by
the
professor
applause
replied
modestly
beating
his
breast
i
have
what
is
most
important
courage
a
great
deal
of
courage
then
in
order
to
celebrate
the
stroke
he
called
on
morito
sprite
who
was
already
creeping
out
anticipating
the
order
to
fetch
them
a
bottle
of
wine
when
they
knew
that
the
man
who
accompanied
the
professor
was
the
celebrated
gallardo
whose
portraits
they
had
so
often
admired
on
cigarette
boxes
their
delight
knew
no
bounds
and
they
clinked
glasses
of
wine
to
the
success
of
the
torero
even
morito
taking
part
in
the
festival
before
two
months
are
over
mosiu
said
el
pescadero
with
andalusian
gravity
you
will
be
fixing
banderillas
in
the
plaza
in
madrid
and
carrying
off
all
the
palms
and
the
money
and
the
women
saving
your
lady
presence
el
pescadero
walked
with
gallardo
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
street
adios
juan
he
said
gravely
we
may
see
each
other
in
the
plaza
you
see
how
low
i
have
come
that
i
have
to
live
on
these
humbugs
and
idiots
gallardo
walked
away
thoughtful
ay
that
man
whom
he
had
seen
in
his
good
days
throw
away
money
with
princely
generosity
so
sure
was
he
of
his
future
he
had
lost
his
money
in
bad
speculations
and
a
torero
life
was
not
one
to
teach
the
management
of
a
fortune
and
yet
they
were
proposing
to
him
to
retire
from
his
profession
never
he
must
throw
himself
on
the
bulls
the
next
day
he
felt
full
of
courage
and
went
to
the
plaza
undisturbed
by
his
usual
superstitious
fears
he
felt
the
certainty
of
triumph
the
high
of
his
most
glorious
days
from
the
very
first
the
corrida
was
full
of
events
the
first
bull
showed
himself
very
tenacious
attacking
furiously
all
the
men
on
horseback
in
an
instant
he
had
overthrown
three
picadors
who
were
waiting
for
him
with
their
lance
in
rest
two
of
the
horses
lay
dying
streams
of
dark
blood
gushing
out
of
their
torn
chests
the
other
one
mad
with
pain
and
terror
rushed
from
one
end
of
the
plaza
to
the
other
his
belly
ripped
open
and
the
saddle
hanging
loose
showing
between
the
stirrups
the
blue
and
red
entrails
dragging
its
bowels
along
the
ground
and
trampling
them
itself
with
its
hind
legs
they
divided
themselves
like
a
knotted
skein
which
becomes
gradually
disentangled
the
bull
attracted
by
its
wild
rush
followed
it
up
close
driving
his
powerful
head
under
the
belly
lifting
the
horse
on
his
horns
throwing
it
on
the
ground
and
then
furiously
attacking
the
miserable
torn
and
pierced
carcass
when
the
bull
left
it
kicking
and
dying
a
mono
sabio
came
up
to
finish
it
by
driving
the
steel
of
his
dagger
through
the
top
of
the
skull
the
miserable
brute
in
the
extremity
of
its
agony
bit
the
man
who
screamed
lifting
his
bloody
right
hand
and
striking
home
the
dagger
till
the
animal
ceased
to
struggle
and
the
limbs
remained
rigid
then
other
employés
of
the
circus
ran
up
with
large
baskets
of
sand
which
they
threw
in
heaps
over
the
pools
of
blood
and
the
bodies
of
the
horses
by
this
time
the
whole
audience
were
on
their
feet
shouting
and
gesticulating
wildly
they
were
delighted
at
the
bull
fierceness
and
protested
loudly
at
there
being
not
a
single
picador
left
in
the
arena
yelling
with
one
voice
horses
more
horses
they
all
knew
well
enough
that
more
would
come
out
immediately
but
they
seemed
furious
that
another
instant
should
go
by
without
fresh
butcheries
the
bull
remained
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
arena
superb
and
bellowing
his
bloody
horns
held
high
and
the
ribbon
with
the
badge
of
his
herd
floating
on
his
neck
which
was
covered
with
red
and
blue
gashes
fresh
riders
came
out
and
again
the
horrible
spectacle
was
repeated
as
soon
as
a
picador
with
his
lance
in
rest
approached
the
bull
bringing
up
his
horse
sideways
with
one
eye
bandaged
so
that
it
should
not
see
the
bull
the
shock
and
the
fall
were
instantaneous
the
lances
broke
with
the
splintering
of
dry
wood
the
horse
was
tossed
in
the
air
by
the
powerful
horns
sprinkling
the
arena
with
its
blood
and
bowels
and
the
picador
rolled
on
the
arena
like
a
yellow
legged
doll
covered
immediately
by
his
companions
capes
the
public
hailed
the
noisy
falls
of
the
riders
with
laughter
and
exclamations
of
delight
the
arena
rang
with
the
shock
of
the
fall
of
the
heavy
bodies
with
their
legs
one
fell
like
a
full
sack
his
head
striking
the
wall
of
the
barrier
with
a
dull
echo
that
one
wo
get
up
yelled
the
crowd
his
melon
must
be
cracked
but
nevertheless
he
got
up
stretching
his
arms
rubbing
his
head
and
picking
up
the
stout
beaver
which
had
rolled
on
the
sand
again
mounted
the
same
horse
which
the
monos
sabios
by
dint
of
kicks
and
blows
had
got
on
to
its
feet
and
bestriding
this
dying
mount
with
its
entrails
dragging
on
the
sand
he
went
once
more
to
encounter
the
furious
beast
this
is
for
you
he
shouted
throwing
the
beaver
into
a
group
of
friends
but
no
sooner
had
he
again
placed
himself
opposite
the
bull
driving
his
pike
into
its
neck
than
man
and
horse
were
once
more
tossed
in
the
air
parting
company
from
the
violence
of
the
shock
each
one
rolling
to
a
different
side
of
the
arena
several
times
before
the
bull
attacked
the
monos
sabios
and
also
some
of
the
public
had
advised
the
rider
to
dismount
get
down
get
down
but
before
his
stiffly
encased
legs
could
do
so
the
horse
would
fall
dead
and
the
picador
would
be
sent
flying
over
his
ears
his
head
arriving
with
a
heavy
blow
on
the
sand
the
bull
had
not
succeeded
in
goring
any
of
the
riders
but
some
of
the
picadors
lay
insensible
on
the
ground
and
the
circus
servants
were
obliged
to
carry
them
out
to
the
infirmary
to
be
treated
for
broken
bones
or
to
be
revived
from
the
shock
which
seemed
like
death
gallardo
most
anxious
to
gain
the
sympathies
of
his
public
was
here
there
and
everywhere
earning
immense
applause
by
seizing
the
tail
and
pulling
till
it
turned
away
from
the
picador
lying
on
the
ground
in
danger
of
being
gored
while
the
banderilleros
were
engaged
gallardo
leaning
on
the
barrier
passed
the
boxes
in
review
doña
sol
was
sure
to
be
there
at
last
he
caught
sight
of
her
but
without
the
white
mantilla
there
was
nothing
about
her
to
remind
one
of
the
lady
in
seville
who
was
so
like
one
of
goya
pictures
with
her
golden
hair
and
her
large
and
elegant
hat
she
might
have
been
a
foreigner
seeing
a
for
the
first
time
by
her
side
sat
that
man
of
whom
she
spoke
so
admiringly
and
to
whom
she
was
showing
the
sights
of
the
country
ay
doña
sol
soon
she
would
see
what
the
fine
fellow
she
had
deserted
really
was
she
would
have
to
applaud
him
even
in
the
presence
of
the
hated
stranger
she
would
become
enthusiastic
even
against
her
will
carried
away
by
the
contagion
of
the
masses
when
the
time
came
for
gallardo
to
kill
his
bull
which
was
the
second
the
masses
received
him
cordially
as
if
they
had
forgotten
their
annoyance
at
the
previous
corrida
the
people
seemed
inclined
to
be
tolerant
after
the
spell
of
wet
weather
as
if
they
wished
to
find
everything
good
in
the
long
expected
besides
the
courage
of
the
first
bull
and
the
great
mortality
among
the
horses
had
put
the
crowd
in
a
splendid
humour
gallardo
walked
towards
the
bull
with
his
head
uncovered
after
the
brindis
with
the
muleta
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
the
rapier
waving
like
a
cane
he
was
followed
though
at
a
prudent
distance
by
el
nacional
and
another
torero
several
voices
from
the
sunny
side
protested
how
many
more
acolytes
he
looked
like
a
parish
priest
going
to
a
funeral
go
out
everybody
shouted
gallardo
the
two
peons
stopped
because
it
was
said
in
a
voice
which
left
no
room
for
doubt
he
went
forward
till
he
came
close
to
the
beast
and
then
unfolded
the
muleta
giving
some
passes
quite
in
his
old
style
even
placing
the
rag
on
the
slavering
muzzle
a
pass
olé
and
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
ran
over
the
benches
the
lad
from
seville
was
again
worthy
of
his
name
he
had
regained
his
professional
pride
he
was
going
to
perform
some
of
his
old
strokes
as
in
his
best
days
his
muleta
passes
were
greeted
with
noisy
exclamations
of
delight
and
on
the
benches
his
partisans
revived
rebuking
his
enemies
that
afternoon
was
one
of
his
best
when
they
saw
the
bull
standing
motionless
the
public
themselves
encouraged
him
with
their
advice
now
then
strike
gallardo
threw
himself
on
the
bull
with
his
rapier
in
front
slipping
quickly
away
from
the
menace
of
the
horns
the
applause
rang
out
but
it
was
short
and
followed
by
a
threatening
murmur
mingled
with
strident
whistling
the
enthusiasts
ceased
to
look
at
the
bull
to
turn
their
indignation
on
the
public
what
injustice
what
want
of
knowledge
he
had
entered
to
kill
splendidly
but
thousands
of
inimical
fingers
pointed
to
the
bull
without
ceasing
their
protests
and
the
whole
plaza
joined
them
in
a
deafening
storm
of
whistling
the
rapier
had
penetrated
slant
ways
crossing
the
bull
its
point
appearing
between
his
ribs
just
behind
the
foreleg
every
one
gesticulated
waving
their
arms
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
what
a
scandal
a
bad
novillero
could
not
have
done
worse
the
animal
with
the
hilt
of
the
sword
in
his
neck
and
the
point
appearing
from
the
wrench
of
the
espada
arm
began
to
hobble
its
enormous
bulk
swaying
with
its
unsteady
gait
this
seemed
to
move
every
one
to
a
generous
indignation
poor
bull
such
a
good
one
so
noble
many
threw
themselves
forward
roaring
with
fury
as
if
they
intended
throwing
themselves
bodily
into
the
arena
thief
son
of
a
to
torture
a
bicho
like
that
who
is
better
than
he
is
all
shouted
seized
with
a
vehement
tenderness
for
the
brute
suffering
just
as
though
they
had
not
paid
to
see
its
death
gallardo
stupefied
at
his
deed
bent
his
head
beneath
the
whirlwind
of
insults
and
threats
cursed
bad
luck
he
had
entered
to
kill
splendidly
just
as
in
his
best
days
overcoming
the
nervous
shrinking
which
made
him
turn
his
face
away
as
though
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
the
brute
coming
down
on
him
but
the
desire
to
avoid
danger
to
get
out
from
between
the
horns
as
quickly
as
possible
had
made
him
ruin
his
luck
by
that
disgraceful
and
unskilful
stroke
the
bull
after
limping
about
for
some
time
with
painful
staggering
stood
still
gallardo
took
another
sword
and
again
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
beast
the
public
guessed
his
intention
he
was
proceeding
to
the
descabello
the
only
thing
he
could
do
after
such
a
criminal
stroke
he
leant
the
point
of
the
rapier
between
the
two
horns
while
with
the
other
hand
he
waved
the
muleta
so
that
the
beast
attracted
by
the
fluttering
cloth
should
lower
its
head
to
the
ground
the
espada
struck
with
his
rapier
but
the
bull
feeling
himself
wounded
tossed
his
head
wildly
and
ejected
the
weapon
one
roared
the
crowd
with
almost
laughable
unanimity
the
matador
again
repeated
his
stroke
and
once
again
drove
in
the
rapier
the
only
result
being
to
make
the
brute
shiver
two
sang
out
from
the
gods
in
derision
a
fresh
attempt
only
succeeded
like
the
others
in
drawing
a
low
bellow
from
the
tortured
animal
three
but
to
this
ironical
chorus
the
masses
now
joined
whistles
and
cries
of
protest
when
would
that
matador
finish
it
on
the
fourth
attempt
he
succeeded
in
severing
the
spinal
cord
and
the
bull
fell
instantaneously
lying
on
his
side
with
his
legs
rigid
the
espada
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
and
walked
slowly
round
almost
gasping
for
breath
to
salute
the
president
at
last
he
was
free
from
that
animal
he
thought
he
never
would
have
finished
it
on
his
way
the
mob
either
greeted
him
sarcastically
or
with
contemptuous
silence
no
one
applauded
he
saluted
the
president
amid
the
general
indifference
and
then
took
refuge
behind
the
barrier
like
a
school
boy
ashamed
of
his
misdeeds
while
garabato
offered
him
a
glass
of
water
his
eyes
ran
round
the
boxes
meeting
those
of
doña
sol
which
had
followed
him
to
his
refuge
what
would
that
woman
think
of
him
how
she
would
laugh
with
her
travelling
companion
seeing
him
ridiculed
by
the
public
what
an
unlucky
idea
of
hers
to
come
to
that
corrida
he
remained
between
the
barriers
trying
to
avoid
further
fatigue
till
the
last
bull
he
had
to
kill
should
come
out
his
broken
leg
pained
him
greatly
from
having
run
so
much
he
was
no
longer
the
same
he
was
obliged
to
recognize
it
all
his
confidence
all
his
resolutions
of
throwing
himself
on
the
bull
were
useless
his
legs
were
neither
as
light
nor
as
steady
as
formerly
neither
had
his
right
arm
that
daring
which
made
it
throw
itself
out
without
fear
anxious
to
reach
the
neck
of
the
bull
as
soon
as
possible
now
it
drew
itself
in
against
his
will
with
the
cautious
instinct
of
certain
animals
who
think
if
they
hide
their
faces
they
can
in
this
way
avoid
danger
his
old
superstitious
terrors
suddenly
reappeared
crushing
overwhelming
i
am
in
bad
luck
thought
gallardo
my
heart
tells
me
the
fifth
bull
will
catch
me
he
will
catch
me
nothing
can
be
done
all
the
same
when
the
fifth
bull
came
out
into
the
plaza
the
first
cape
to
meet
him
was
gallardo
what
an
animal
he
looked
quite
different
from
the
one
he
had
chosen
in
the
yard
the
evening
before
fear
went
on
singing
in
the
torero
ears
bad
luck
he
will
catch
me
i
shall
leave
the
circus
feet
foremost
in
spite
of
this
he
continued
playing
with
the
bull
and
drawing
it
away
from
the
endangered
picadors
at
first
his
endeavours
were
received
in
silence
but
later
the
people
softened
a
little
and
applauded
him
feebly
when
the
supreme
moment
arrived
for
the
death
of
the
bull
all
present
seemed
to
guess
the
confusion
of
his
mind
his
play
was
disordered
it
was
sufficient
for
the
bull
to
shake
his
head
for
him
to
take
it
as
a
sign
of
charging
throwing
his
feet
backwards
and
receding
by
long
bounds
while
the
public
greeted
those
attempts
at
flight
with
a
chorus
of
mockery
juy
juy
he
is
catching
you
suddenly
as
if
he
wished
to
finish
it
as
soon
as
possible
in
any
way
he
threw
himself
on
the
beast
with
his
rapier
obliquely
to
get
out
of
the
danger
as
quickly
as
he
could
there
was
an
explosion
of
whistling
and
shouting
the
rapier
had
only
gone
in
an
inch
or
two
and
after
vibrating
in
the
brute
neck
was
ejected
by
him
to
some
distance
gallardo
turned
to
pick
tip
the
rapier
and
again
approached
the
bull
he
was
squaring
himself
to
go
in
to
kill
when
the
bull
charged
him
at
the
same
moment
he
wished
to
fly
but
his
legs
had
no
longer
the
agility
of
former
days
he
was
caught
and
rolled
over
by
the
impetus
of
the
rush
while
everyone
ran
to
his
help
gallardo
picked
himself
up
covered
with
sand
with
a
rent
in
the
back
of
his
breeches
through
which
his
shirt
tail
appeared
minus
a
shoe
and
without
the
mona
which
adorned
his
pigtail
that
gallant
and
dashing
young
fellow
who
had
been
the
admiration
of
the
populace
for
his
elegance
now
looked
pitiful
and
ridiculous
with
his
shirt
tail
sticking
out
his
hair
disarranged
and
his
pigtail
fallen
down
and
unfastened
looking
like
a
wretched
tail
many
capes
were
pityingly
spread
round
him
to
help
and
protect
him
while
the
other
espadas
with
generous
comradeship
worked
the
bull
and
prepared
him
so
that
gallardo
might
finish
him
without
difficulty
but
gallardo
seemed
blind
and
deaf
the
sight
alone
of
the
animal
was
enough
to
make
him
throw
himself
back
at
the
slightest
sign
of
attack
it
seemed
as
though
his
recent
overturn
had
driven
him
mad
with
fright
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
what
his
comrades
said
to
him
and
with
frowning
brows
and
face
intensely
pale
he
stammered
out
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
go
out
every
one
leave
me
alone
while
terror
was
singing
in
his
heart
you
will
die
this
is
your
last
cogida
the
public
guessed
the
espada
thoughts
by
the
wildness
of
his
movements
he
is
terrified
of
the
bull
panic
has
seized
him
even
his
most
fervent
partisans
were
ashamed
and
silent
unable
to
explain
a
thing
such
as
they
had
never
seen
before
the
people
seemed
to
enjoy
his
terror
with
the
valour
of
those
in
a
safe
place
others
thinking
themselves
defrauded
of
their
money
shouted
themselves
hoarse
gallardo
protected
by
his
companions
capes
took
advantage
of
any
opportunity
of
wounding
the
beast
with
his
sword
deaf
to
the
sarcastic
jests
of
the
populace
but
they
were
thrusts
the
animal
scarcely
seemed
to
feel
his
terror
at
being
caught
lengthened
his
arm
making
him
stand
far
off
only
wounding
the
beast
with
the
point
of
the
sword
some
of
the
rapiers
shook
themselves
loose
being
scarcely
fixed
in
the
flesh
others
remained
stuck
in
a
bone
but
the
greater
part
of
the
length
uncovered
bending
with
the
brute
movements
the
bull
was
following
the
circuit
of
the
barrier
bellowing
with
his
head
low
as
if
complaining
of
this
useless
torture
the
espada
followed
him
muleta
in
hand
anxious
to
finish
him
yet
dreading
to
expose
himself
and
behind
him
came
a
whole
troup
of
peons
spreading
their
capes
as
though
by
this
fluttering
of
stuffs
they
were
trying
to
persuade
the
bull
to
double
up
his
legs
and
to
lie
down
on
the
sand
the
bull
progress
close
to
the
barrier
with
his
neck
bristling
with
rapiers
provoked
storms
of
sarcasms
and
insults
it
like
la
dolorosa
they
shouted
others
compared
the
animal
to
a
pincushion
full
of
pins
thief
bad
torero
others
insulted
the
torero
by
changing
his
name
to
the
feminine
juanita
do
run
into
danger
much
time
was
being
lost
and
part
of
the
audience
becoming
furious
turned
towards
the
presidential
box
señor
presidente
how
long
is
this
scandal
to
go
on
the
president
made
a
gesture
which
silenced
the
storm
and
then
made
a
sign
soon
an
alguacil
in
his
feathered
hat
and
fluttering
cape
was
seen
running
round
the
barrier
to
the
spot
where
the
bull
was
standing
then
directing
his
gesture
towards
gallardo
he
raised
one
closed
fist
with
the
forefinger
outstretched
the
mob
applauded
it
was
the
first
warning
if
before
the
third
the
matador
had
not
killed
his
bull
it
would
be
taken
back
to
the
yard
and
the
matador
would
remain
under
the
stigma
of
the
deepest
dishonour
gallardo
as
if
awakening
suddenly
from
his
somnambulism
crushed
by
this
threat
placed
his
rapier
horizontally
and
threw
himself
on
the
bull
it
was
only
one
estocade
the
more
which
scarcely
penetrated
into
the
bull
body
the
espada
let
his
arms
fall
utterly
disheartened
was
that
brute
immortal
the
rapier
thrusts
seemed
to
do
him
no
harm
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
never
die
the
futility
of
the
last
stroke
infuriated
the
people
they
all
rose
to
their
feet
the
storm
of
whistling
became
absolutely
deafening
obliging
the
women
to
stop
their
ears
oranges
scraps
of
bread
cushions
any
projectile
ready
to
hand
was
hurled
into
the
arena
at
the
matador
from
the
sunny
side
came
stentorian
voices
roars
like
a
siren
which
it
seemed
impossible
should
come
from
human
throats
a
horrible
din
of
rang
out
suddenly
like
a
tocsin
while
from
the
benches
close
to
the
bulls
box
a
chorus
began
to
chant
the
of
the
dead
many
turned
towards
the
president
when
would
the
second
warning
be
given
gallardo
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
looking
all
around
him
as
if
astounded
at
the
injustice
of
the
populace
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
doña
sol
but
she
had
turned
her
back
to
the
circus
did
she
feel
any
pity
or
was
she
ashamed
of
her
condescensions
in
the
past
again
he
threw
himself
on
the
bull
to
kill
but
very
few
could
see
what
was
happening
for
the
spread
capes
fluttering
incessantly
round
him
concealed
everything
at
last
the
bull
fell
a
stream
of
blood
rushing
from
its
mouth
at
last
the
public
quieted
down
a
little
ceasing
to
thump
but
still
continuing
shouting
and
whistling
the
animal
was
finished
by
the
puntilero
he
was
fastened
by
his
poll
to
the
team
of
mules
and
dragged
out
of
the
arena
leaving
behind
him
a
broad
belt
of
smoothed
sand
covered
with
which
the
servants
obliterated
with
rakes
and
baskets
of
sand
gallardo
hid
himself
between
the
barriers
shrinking
from
the
storm
of
insults
his
presence
raised
there
he
remained
weary
and
panting
his
leg
paining
him
greatly
but
in
the
midst
of
his
discouragement
feeling
an
intense
comfort
at
being
out
of
danger
he
had
not
died
by
the
bull
horns
but
he
owed
it
to
his
prudence
ah
that
public
after
all
they
were
only
a
crowd
of
murderers
anxious
for
a
man
death
as
if
they
alone
loved
life
the
exit
from
the
plaza
was
through
the
crowd
of
people
massed
outside
carriages
automobiles
and
long
rows
of
tramways
gallardo
coach
was
obliged
to
go
slowly
to
avoid
running
over
the
crowds
coming
out
of
the
plaza
these
opened
out
to
let
the
mules
pass
but
on
recognizing
the
espada
they
seemed
to
repent
of
their
courtesy
gallardo
guessed
by
the
movement
of
their
lips
that
they
were
insulting
him
carriages
full
of
pretty
women
in
white
mantillas
passed
close
to
him
but
they
turned
their
heads
away
while
others
looked
at
him
with
pitying
eyes
the
espada
drew
back
as
if
he
wished
to
pass
unnoticed
hiding
himself
behind
the
bulk
of
el
nacional
who
sat
silent
and
frowning
a
group
of
urchins
following
the
carriage
began
to
whistle
while
many
walking
on
the
pavements
followed
their
example
the
news
of
fiasco
had
spread
rapidly
and
they
were
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
insult
a
man
whom
they

chapter
x
the
following
sunday
as
the
cuadrilla
had
just
entered
the
circus
some
one
knocked
loudly
at
the
puerta
de
caballerizas
an
employé
of
the
plaza
shouted
from
inside
that
there
was
no
entrance
that
way
they
must
go
round
to
the
other
door
but
as
the
voice
outside
continued
to
insist
he
finally
opened
the
door
a
man
and
a
woman
entered
he
wearing
a
white
cordoban
felt
hat
she
dressed
in
black
with
a
mantilla
the
man
shook
the
employé
hand
leaving
something
in
it
which
evidently
softened
his
asperity
you
know
me
do
you
not
said
the
new
comer
really
do
you
know
me
i
am
gallardo
and
this
lady
is
his
wife
carmen
looked
all
around
at
the
deserted
courtyard
through
the
brick
walls
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
music
and
the
humming
of
the
crowd
varied
by
cries
of
enthusiasm
or
murmurs
of
curiosity
where
is
he
enquired
carmen
anxiously
where
should
he
be
woman
replied
her
roughly
in
the
plaza
fulfilling
his
duties
it
is
folly
to
have
come
here
what
a
flighty
woman
you
are
carmen
looked
round
her
undecidedly
perhaps
half
repenting
having
come
after
all
what
was
she
going
to
do
there
the
employé
whose
with
antonio
had
made
a
marvellous
difference
suggested
that
if
the
lady
wished
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
corrida
she
could
rest
in
the
room
but
if
she
wished
to
see
the
corrida
he
could
find
her
a
very
good
seat
even
if
she
had
no
ticket
carmen
was
terrified
at
this
proposal
see
the
corrida
no
she
had
never
seen
her
husband
fight
she
would
wait
there
as
long
as
she
possibly
could
god
will
be
done
said
the
saddler
resignedly
we
will
stay
here
though
what
we
shall
see
opposite
this
doorway
i
do
know
about
on
the
saturday
carmen
had
called
antonio
into
the
matador
study
and
told
him
of
her
intention
to
go
at
once
to
madrid
she
could
not
stay
in
seville
she
had
had
a
week
of
restless
nights
which
her
imagination
had
peopled
with
horrible
scenes
and
her
feminine
instinct
made
her
fear
some
great
disaster
she
felt
she
must
be
by
juan
side
she
did
not
know
why
nor
what
would
happen
on
the
journey
all
she
wanted
was
to
be
near
gallardo
life
was
not
worth
living
like
this
she
had
seen
in
the
papers
great
fiasco
on
the
previous
sunday
she
knew
his
professional
pride
and
knew
he
could
not
bear
this
misfortune
patiently
the
last
letter
she
had
received
from
him
had
plainly
showed
her
this
no
and
again
no
she
said
energetically
to
her
objection
i
start
for
madrid
this
afternoon
if
you
like
to
come
well
and
good
if
not
i
shall
go
alone
above
all
not
a
word
to
don
josé
he
would
try
to
prevent
my
journey
the
saddler
finally
agreed
after
all
a
free
journey
to
madrid
was
not
a
thing
to
be
refused
even
though
it
were
in
such
dismal
company
during
the
journey
carmen
made
up
her
mind
she
would
speak
earnestly
to
her
husband
why
go
on
had
they
not
enough
to
live
on
he
must
retire
at
once
if
he
did
not
wish
to
kill
her
this
corrida
must
be
the
last
one
and
even
this
was
one
too
many
she
hoped
to
arrive
in
madrid
in
time
to
prevent
her
husband
fighting
feeling
that
by
her
presence
she
might
prevent
some
catastrophe
what
rubbish
just
like
a
woman
if
they
get
a
thing
into
their
heads
it
must
be
so
do
you
think
there
are
no
authorities
or
laws
or
rules
in
a
plaza
that
it
is
enough
for
a
woman
to
be
frightened
and
want
to
run
and
kiss
her
husband
for
the
corrida
to
be
stopped
and
the
public
disappointed
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
to
juan
afterwards
but
by
now
he
will
be
at
the
corrida
there
is
no
trifling
with
the
authorities
we
should
all
be
sent
to
jail
when
they
arrived
in
madrid
he
had
to
exert
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
to
prevent
his
companion
rushing
to
her
husband
hotel
what
would
be
the
result
she
would
disturb
him
by
her
presence
send
him
to
the
plaza
in
a
bad
humour
upset
his
calmness
and
then
if
anything
happened
all
the
fault
would
be
hers
this
reflection
steadied
carmen
making
her
give
in
to
her
wishes
and
go
to
an
hotel
of
his
choosing
where
she
spent
the
morning
lying
on
a
sofa
crying
as
if
she
considered
misfortune
imminent
the
saddler
delighted
to
find
himself
in
madrid
and
comfortably
lodged
was
furious
with
this
despair
which
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
the
hotel
was
near
the
puerta
del
sol
and
the
noise
of
the
carriages
and
people
going
to
the
corrida
reached
her
she
could
not
stay
in
the
house
she
must
see
him
she
had
not
courage
enough
to
go
to
the
spectacle
but
she
wished
to
feel
near
him
and
she
wished
to
go
to
the
plaza
where
was
the
plaza
she
had
never
seen
it
even
if
she
could
not
go
in
she
could
wander
round
it
feeling
that
her
near
presence
might
influence
gallardo
luck
the
saddler
expostulated
by
the
life
of
he
certainly
intended
to
go
to
the
corrida
he
had
gone
out
to
buy
his
ticket
and
now
carmen
prevented
his
enjoying
the
fiesta
by
wanting
to
go
to
the
plaza
herself
what
can
you
do
when
you
get
there
what
good
can
your
presence
do
just
think
if
juaniyo
caught
sight
of
you
but
to
all
his
arguments
carmen
replied
with
the
same
obstinacy
if
you
do
not
care
to
come
with
me
i
will
go
alone
antonio
ended
by
giving
in
and
they
drove
to
the
plaza
together
entering
by
the
puerta
de
caballerizas
the
saddler
remembered
the
plaza
well
as
he
had
accompanied
gallardo
on
one
of
his
journeys
to
madrid
during
the
spring
he
and
the
employé
both
felt
out
of
humour
with
that
woman
with
the
red
eyes
and
streaming
cheeks
who
stood
in
the
not
knowing
what
to
do
the
two
men
heard
the
noise
of
the
people
and
the
music
in
the
plaza
were
they
going
to
stay
there
all
night
without
seeing
the
corrida
at
last
the
employé
had
a
happy
inspiration
perhaps
the
lady
would
like
to
go
into
the
chapel
the
procession
of
the
cuadrillas
was
ended
and
through
the
doorway
several
horsemen
came
trotting
back
from
the
circus
these
were
the
picadors
who
were
not
on
duty
and
who
withdrew
from
the
arena
ready
to
replace
their
comrades
when
required
tied
to
rings
on
the
wall
were
a
row
of
saddled
horses
the
first
who
would
have
to
go
into
the
circus
in
place
of
any
killed
behind
these
the
picadors
were
employing
their
wait
by
making
their
horses
pirouette
and
turn
and
a
was
galloping
a
restless
horse
to
quiet
it
before
giving
it
over
to
the
picadors
all
the
horses
were
kicking
plagued
by
flies
and
dragging
at
their
halters
as
if
they
scented
the
danger
close
at
hand
carmen
and
her
were
obliged
to
take
refuge
beneath
the
arcades
and
finally
the
torero
wife
accepted
the
man
invitation
to
go
into
the
chapel
it
was
a
safe
and
quiet
spot
and
possibly
in
there
she
might
do
something
to
help
her
husband
when
she
found
herself
in
the
holy
place
close
and
hot
from
the
crowd
of
people
who
had
watched
the
torero
prayers
she
fixed
her
eyes
in
astonishment
on
the
poverty
of
the
altar
four
lights
only
were
burning
before
the
virgin
of
the
dove
which
seemed
to
her
a
wretched
tribute
she
opened
her
purse
to
give
a
duro
to
the
employé
could
he
not
bring
some
more
tapers
the
man
scratched
his
head
tapers
tapers
in
the
purlieus
of
the
plaza
such
things
were
not
to
be
found
but
he
suddenly
remembered
that
the
sisters
of
a
certain
matador
always
brought
some
wax
tapers
whenever
he
fought
there
and
the
last
supply
was
not
all
consumed
they
must
be
in
some
corner
of
the
chapel
after
a
long
search
they
were
found
but
there
were
no
candlesticks
however
the
employé
was
a
man
of
resource
and
fetching
some
empty
bottles
he
stuck
the
candles
in
their
necks
and
placed
them
among
the
other
lights
carmen
knelt
down
and
the
two
men
took
advantage
of
her
absorbed
devotion
to
rush
away
to
the
plaza
anxious
to
see
the
first
events
of
the
corrida
she
remained
alone
contemplating
with
curiosity
the
dusty
painting
reddened
by
the
lights
she
did
not
know
this
virgin
but
surely
she
must
be
gentle
and
kind
like
the
one
in
seville
to
whom
she
had
prayed
so
often
besides
she
was
the
toreros
virgin
the
one
who
heard
their
last
prayer
when
coming
danger
gave
those
rough
men
a
pious
sincerity
on
that
pavement
also
her
husband
had
often
knelt
her
lips
moved
repeating
the
prayers
with
automatic
speed
but
her
thoughts
were
far
away
attracted
by
the
noise
of
the
crowd
which
reached
her
ay
the
roaring
of
that
intermittent
volcano
the
surging
of
those
distant
waves
broken
at
times
by
a
tragic
silence
carmen
fancied
she
could
unseen
watch
the
corrida
she
could
guess
by
the
different
intonations
of
the
noises
in
the
plaza
the
course
of
the
tragedy
which
was
being
unfolded
in
the
circus
sometimes
it
was
an
explosion
of
indignant
cries
accompanied
by
whistling
at
others
thousands
and
thousands
of
voices
seemed
uttering
unintelligible
words
suddenly
there
was
a
scream
of
terror
long
and
strident
which
seemed
to
rise
even
to
heaven
a
terrified
and
gasping
exclamation
which
made
her
see
thousands
of
outstretched
heads
pale
with
emotion
following
the
rapid
rush
of
a
bull
on
the
tracks
of
a
man
but
the
cries
suddenly
ceased
and
calm
returned
the
danger
was
past
sometimes
there
were
long
spells
of
absolute
silence
in
which
the
humming
of
the
flies
could
be
heard
a
silence
so
profound
it
seemed
as
if
the
immense
circus
must
be
empty
as
if
the
fourteen
thousand
people
on
its
benches
did
not
even
breathe
and
that
carmen
herself
was
the
only
living
creature
within
its
walls
suddenly
this
silence
was
broken
by
an
immense
and
noisy
uproar
so
loud
one
would
have
thought
that
every
brick
in
the
building
was
knocking
against
its
neighbour
a
wild
volley
of
applause
which
made
the
whole
place
shake
in
the
courtyard
close
by
the
chapel
the
sound
of
whacks
on
the
loins
of
the
horses
tied
there
was
heard
then
the
sound
of
iron
hoofs
on
the
pavement
lastly
the
sound
of
voices
who
is
hit
and
fresh
picadors
were
called
into
the
arena
to
these
distant
noises
were
now
joined
others
nearer
and
more
terrifying
the
sound
of
steps
to
the
rooms
near
doors
hurriedly
opened
the
panting
breathing
and
gasping
voices
of
several
men
as
if
they
were
staggering
under
a
great
weight
it
is
nothing
only
a
bruise
you
are
not
bleeding
before
the
corrida
is
ended
you
will
be
on
your
horse
again
a
hoarse
voice
weak
with
pain
moaned
between
sighs
in
an
accent
which
reminded
carmen
of
her
own
country
oh
virgin
of
solitude
i
think
something
is
broken
search
well
doctor
ay
my
children
carmen
trembled
with
fright
she
raised
her
eyes
suffused
with
terror
to
the
virgin
she
felt
as
if
she
might
fall
fainting
on
the
floor
she
tried
again
to
pray
not
to
listen
to
the
noises
from
outside
transmitted
through
the
walls
with
such
desperate
clearness
but
in
spite
of
her
endeavour
the
sound
of
splashing
water
fell
on
her
ears
and
the
sounds
of
men
voices
probably
the
doctors
encouraging
the
patient
virgin
of
solitude
my
children
what
will
become
of
my
poor
angels
if
their
father
can
not
fight
carmen
rose
ay
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
should
faint
if
she
remained
longer
in
that
dark
place
terrified
by
those
cries
of
pain
she
must
have
air
get
out
into
the
sun
she
fancied
she
felt
in
her
own
bones
all
the
pain
that
unknown
man
was
suffering
she
went
out
into
the
courtyard
there
was
blood
on
every
side
blood
on
the
ground
and
blood
round
some
pails
in
which
the
water
was
coloured
red
the
picadors
were
coming
out
of
the
circus
the
banderilleros
were
having
their
turn
now
the
riders
came
in
on
their
horses
stained
with
blood
their
flesh
torn
their
entrails
hanging
down
the
riders
dismounted
talking
with
animation
of
the
events
of
the
corrida
carmen
watched
potaje
ponderous
humanity
get
down
stiffly
and
heavily
swearing
at
the
mono
sabio
who
did
not
help
his
descent
with
sufficient
alacrity
he
seemed
benumbed
by
his
heavy
iron
leggings
and
by
the
pain
of
various
bruises
he
raised
one
hand
ruefully
to
rub
his
shoulders
but
all
the
same
he
smiled
showing
all
his
yellow
tusks
have
you
all
seen
how
fine
juan
has
been
he
said
to
those
surrounding
him
he
has
been
quite
splendid
as
he
noticed
the
only
woman
in
the
patio
and
recognized
her
he
showed
no
sort
of
surprise
you
here
señora
carmen
that
right
he
spoke
quietly
as
if
his
habitual
vinous
somnolence
and
his
natural
stupidity
prevented
anything
surprising
him
have
you
seen
juan
he
went
on
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
in
front
of
the
bull
under
its
very
nose
no
one
can
do
what
that
gacho
does
you
should
go
and
see
him
for
he
is
splendid
some
one
called
him
from
the
infirmary
door
his
companion
the
other
picador
wished
to
speak
to
him
before
being
taken
away
to
the
hospital
adio
seña
carmen
i
must
go
and
see
what
the
poor
fellow
wants
a
bad
fracture
they
say
he
will
not
be
able
to
work
again
this
season
carmen
took
refuge
beneath
the
arcades
she
tried
to
close
her
eyes
not
to
see
the
horrible
spectacle
in
the
courtyard
while
at
the
same
time
she
felt
fascinated
by
the
crimson
pools
of
blood
the
monos
sabios
led
in
the
wounded
horses
who
were
dragging
their
entrails
along
the
ground
as
she
saw
them
the
head
man
in
charge
of
the
stables
bustled
about
in
a
fever
of
activity
now
my
lads
hurry
up
he
shouted
to
the
stable
lads
gently
gently
there
a
went
carefully
up
to
the
horse
who
was
rearing
with
pain
and
took
the
saddle
off
then
he
tied
ropes
round
his
four
feet
drew
them
together
and
threw
him
now
my
fine
fellow
gently
gently
with
him
he
shouted
to
the
man
never
ceasing
to
move
his
own
hands
and
feet
the
stable
lads
in
their
shirt
sleeves
leant
over
the
belly
from
which
were
gushing
streams
of
blood
and
water
endeavouring
to
put
back
by
handfuls
the
slippery
entrails
hanging
out
of
it
others
held
the
animal
reins
putting
a
foot
on
its
head
to
keep
it
on
the
ground
its
muzzle
twitched
with
pain
and
its
teeth
rattled
together
with
the
anguish
of
its
torment
while
its
agonized
squeals
were
smothered
by
the
pressure
on
its
head
the
bloody
hands
of
the
workers
endeavoured
to
replace
the
bowels
in
the
empty
cavity
but
the
gasping
breathing
of
the
unfortunate
animal
constantly
blew
out
again
the
entrails
the
men
were
pushing
in
like
bundles
at
last
they
were
all
pushed
back
into
the
stomach
and
the
lads
with
the
quickness
of
long
habit
sewed
the
sides
of
the
wound
together
after
the
animal
was
mended
with
this
barbarous
promptitude
a
pail
of
water
was
thrown
over
its
head
its
legs
were
freed
from
the
ropes
and
a
few
kicks
and
blows
with
a
stick
made
it
scramble
on
to
its
feet
some
only
walked
a
few
steps
falling
down
again
with
torrents
of
blood
rushing
from
the
wound
this
meant
instantaneous
death
others
stood
up
apparently
stronger
from
their
immense
resources
of
animal
vitality
and
the
lads
after
mending
them
up
took
them
off
to
the
courtyard
to
be
varnished
there
their
stomach
and
legs
were
cleansed
by
several
pailsful
of
water
thrown
over
them
which
left
their
white
or
chestnut
coats
bright
and
shining
while
streams
of
bloody
water
ran
down
their
legs
on
to
the
ground
they
mended
the
horses
just
like
old
shoes
prolonging
their
agony
and
retarding
their
death
working
their
weakness
up
to
the
last
possible
moment
fragments
of
their
entrails
which
had
been
cut
off
to
facilitate
the
repairing
operation
lay
about
the
floor
other
fragments
lay
in
the
circus
covered
with
sand
till
the
death
of
the
bull
should
permit
of
the
attendants
collecting
the
remains
in
their
baskets
very
often
these
practitioners
supplied
the
horrible
absence
of
the
lost
organs
by
handfuls
of
tow
stuffed
into
the
stomach
the
chief
thing
was
to
keep
these
miserable
animals
on
foot
a
few
moments
longer
till
the
picadors
should
return
to
the
arena
when
the
bull
would
soon
take
charge
and
finish
the
work
even
here
the
noisy
shouts
of
the
invisible
crowd
reached
carmen
sometimes
they
were
exclamations
of
anxiety
an
ay
ay
from
thousands
of
voices
that
told
of
the
flight
of
a
banderillero
closely
pursued
by
the
bull
then
there
would
be
absolute
silence
the
man
had
again
turned
on
the
brute
and
the
noisy
applause
broke
out
once
more
when
he
had
skilfully
fixed
two
more
darts
then
the
trumpets
sounded
announcing
that
the
time
for
the
death
stroke
had
come
and
the
applause
rang
out
afresh
carmen
wished
to
go
away
virgin
of
hope
what
was
she
doing
there
she
was
ignorant
of
the
routine
that
the
matadors
followed
in
their
work
possibly
that
blast
indicated
the
moment
when
her
husband
had
to
face
the
bull
and
she
was
there
only
a
few
steps
away
and
unable
to
see
him
if
she
could
only
get
away
and
escape
from
this
torment
besides
the
blood
running
over
the
courtyard
sickened
her
and
the
poor
brutes
sufferings
her
womanly
sensitiveness
rose
up
against
such
tortures
and
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
nauseated
by
the
smell
of
the
butcheries
she
had
never
been
to
a
a
great
part
of
her
life
had
been
spent
in
hearing
about
corridas
but
in
the
accounts
of
the
fiestas
she
had
never
heard
or
seen
anything
beyond
the
outside
just
what
all
the
world
saw
or
heard
of
the
exploits
in
the
arena
under
the
brilliant
sun
the
flash
of
silk
and
gold
embroideries
all
the
sumptuous
procession
knowing
nothing
of
the
odious
preparations
taking
place
in
the
secrecy
of
the
outbuildings
and
they
lived
from
this
fiesta
with
its
repulsive
torturing
of
weak
animals
their
fortune
had
been
made
from
such
spectacles
tremendous
applause
broke
out
in
the
circus
in
the
courtyard
an
imperious
voice
gave
orders
the
first
bull
had
just
been
killed
the
gates
at
the
end
of
the
passage
of
the
puerta
de
caballos
giving
access
to
the
circus
were
thrown
open
and
the
roars
of
the
crowd
poured
in
louder
and
louder
still
with
the
echoes
of
the
music
the
mule
teams
had
trotted
into
the
plaza
one
to
bring
out
the
dead
horses
and
the
other
to
drag
out
the
carcass
of
the
bull
carmen
caught
sight
of
her
coming
along
under
the
arcades
still
trembling
from
excitement
at
what
he
had
seen
juan
is
colossal
he
has
never
been
anything
like
this
afternoon
have
no
fear
he
seems
to
eat
up
the
bulls
alive
then
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
afraid
she
might
make
him
lose
such
an
interesting
afternoon
what
did
she
decide
to
do
did
she
feel
brave
enough
to
come
into
the
plaza
take
me
away
she
cried
in
agonized
tones
get
me
out
of
here
as
quickly
as
possible
i
feel
ill
you
can
leave
me
in
the
nearest
church
the
saddler
pulled
a
face
by
the
life
of
roger
to
leave
such
a
magnificent
corrida
and
all
the
while
he
was
taking
carmen
towards
the
door
he
was
thinking
how
soon
he
could
leave
her
and
return
to
the
circus
when
the
second
bull
came
out
gallardo
was
still
leaning
on
the
barrier
receiving
the
congratulations
of
his
friends
what
courage
that
fellow
had
when
he
chose
the
whole
plaza
had
applauded
him
with
the
first
bull
forgetting
their
anger
at
the
previous
corridas
when
a
picador
remained
on
the
ground
insensible
from
his
fall
gallardo
had
rushed
up
with
his
cape
and
by
a
series
of
magnificent
veronicas
had
drawn
the
bull
to
the
centre
of
the
arena
eventually
leaving
him
wearied
out
and
motionless
after
his
furious
rushes
at
the
deceiving
red
cloth
the
torero
taking
advantage
of
the
brute
bewilderment
stood
erect
a
few
paces
from
his
muzzle
presenting
his
body
as
though
defying
him
he
felt
the
strong
the
happy
precursor
of
his
greatest
deeds
he
knew
he
must
reconcile
his
public
by
some
sudden
dash
of
audacity
and
quietly
he
knelt
down
opposite
the
horns
albeit
with
a
certain
precaution
ready
to
slip
away
at
the
slightest
sign
of
a
charge
the
bull
remained
quiet
then
he
put
forward
one
hand
till
he
touched
its
foam
flecked
snout
still
the
animal
remained
quiet
then
he
dared
something
which
plunged
the
audience
into
palpitating
silence
slowly
he
lay
down
on
the
sand
using
the
cape
on
his
arm
as
a
pillow
and
so
he
remained
for
some
seconds
below
the
very
nostrils
of
the
brute
who
sniffed
at
this
body
placing
itself
so
daringly
beneath
his
horns
evidently
suspecting
some
hidden
danger
when
the
bull
recovering
his
aggressive
fierceness
lowered
his
horns
the
torero
rolled
towards
his
hoofs
putting
himself
in
this
way
out
of
his
reach
and
the
animal
passed
over
him
seeking
in
his
blind
ferocity
for
the
object
to
attack
gallardo
rose
dusting
the
sand
from
his
clothes
and
the
audience
always
loving
daring
deeds
applauded
him
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
former
days
they
quite
understood
that
the
torero
display
of
courage
was
an
attempt
at
reconciliation
with
themselves
an
effort
to
regain
their
affection
he
had
come
to
the
corrida
ready
for
any
feat
of
daring
which
would
earn
their
plaudits
he
is
often
over
careful
they
said
on
the
benches
often
he
is
weak
but
he
has
toreros
pride
and
he
is
regaining
his
name
their
delighted
excitement
at
gallardo
exploit
and
the
death
of
the
first
bull
turned
to
bad
humour
and
expostulations
as
they
saw
the
second
bull
enter
the
arena
he
was
of
enormous
size
and
fine
appearance
but
he
began
to
trot
all
round
the
arena
looking
with
astonishment
at
the
howling
masses
of
people
crowded
on
the
seats
frightened
by
the
cries
and
whistling
with
which
they
endeavoured
to
excite
him
and
running
away
from
his
own
shadow
imagining
all
sorts
of
snares
the
peons
ran
towards
him
spreading
their
capes
he
attacked
the
red
cloth
for
an
instant
then
suddenly
giving
a
snort
of
surprise
he
turned
tail
and
ran
away
in
the
opposite
direction
with
leaps
and
bounds
his
agility
for
flight
made
the
people
furious
he
is
not
a
bull
he
is
a
monkey
the
maestros
capes
finally
attracted
him
towards
the
barrier
where
the
picadors
waited
for
him
motionless
on
their
horses
their
garrochas
under
their
arms
he
came
up
to
a
rider
with
lowered
head
and
fierce
snorts
as
though
intending
to
attack
but
before
the
iron
could
be
driven
into
his
neck
he
gave
a
bound
and
fled
passing
between
the
peons
outstretched
capes
in
his
flight
he
ran
against
another
picador
repeating
the
bound
the
snort
and
the
flight
then
he
ran
against
a
third
picador
who
caught
him
fairly
on
the
neck
with
his
garrocha
increasing
in
this
way
both
his
fear
and
his
velocity
the
audience
had
risen
to
their
feet
gesticulating
and
shouting
a
craven
bull
what
an
abomination
they
all
turned
towards
the
presidential
box
shouting
their
protests
señor
presidente
this
can
not
be
allowed
from
several
of
the
rows
came
a
chorus
of
voices
repeating
the
same
word
with
monotonous
iteration
fire
fire
the
president
seemed
doubtful
the
bull
was
rushing
all
about
the
ring
followed
by
the
toreros
with
their
capes
on
their
arms
when
some
of
them
succeeded
in
getting
in
front
of
him
and
stopping
him
he
would
sniff
the
cloths
with
his
usual
snort
and
run
off
in
another
direction
kicking
and
bounding
these
flights
increased
the
noisy
expostulations
señor
presidente
was
his
worship
blind
then
bottles
oranges
and
seat
cushions
began
to
shower
into
the
arena
round
the
fugitive
beast
the
masses
loathed
him
for
a
coward
some
of
them
stretched
over
into
the
arena
as
if
they
intended
tearing
the
animal
to
pieces
with
their
own
hands
what
a
scandal
to
see
in
the
madrid
plaza
oxen
only
fit
for
meat
fire
fire
at
last
the
president
waved
a
red
handkerchief
and
a
salvo
of
applause
greeted
the
gesture
the
fire
banderillas
were
a
quite
extraordinary
spectacle
something
entirely
unexpected
which
greatly
increased
the
interest
of
the
corrida
many
who
had
shouted
themselves
hoarse
were
privately
delighted
at
the
incident
they
would
see
the
bull
burning
alive
rushing
about
mad
with
terror
at
the
lightnings
fastened
into
his
neck
el
nacional
came
forward
carrying
two
large
banderillas
seemingly
wrapped
in
black
paper
hanging
points
downward
he
went
towards
the
bull
without
any
great
precautions
as
though
his
cowardice
did
not
deserve
any
high
art
and
stuck
in
the
infernal
darts
amid
the
vindictive
acclamations
of
the
populace
immediately
there
was
an
explosion
and
two
puffs
of
smoke
ran
along
the
animal
neck
in
the
sunlight
the
fire
could
not
be
seen
but
the
hair
disappeared
singed
and
a
black
mark
began
to
spread
over
the
neck
the
bull
surprised
at
the
attack
accelerated
his
flight
as
if
this
could
free
him
from
the
torture
till
suddenly
short
sharp
detonations
like
gun
shots
were
heard
proceeding
from
his
neck
and
showers
of
ash
paper
flew
about
his
eyes
the
beast
bounded
with
the
agility
of
terror
all
four
feet
off
the
ground
at
once
twisting
his
head
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
tear
out
with
his
teeth
these
demoniacal
darts
fixed
in
his
flesh
the
mob
laughed
and
applauded
thinking
these
bounds
and
contortions
extremely
amusing
the
animal
in
spite
of
his
size
and
weight
seemed
to
be
performing
a
dance
like
some
trained
animal
how
they
sting
him
exclaimed
the
populace
with
ferocious
laughter
when
the
banderillas
had
ceased
to
explode
the
melted
fat
on
the
neck
formed
little
bubbles
and
the
bull
no
longer
feeling
the
sting
of
the
fire
stopped
short
his
head
hanging
his
eyes
bloodshot
his
muzzle
covered
with
foam
and
his
red
dry
tongue
licking
the
sand
in
search
of
moisture
another
banderillero
came
up
and
stuck
in
a
second
pair
of
darts
once
more
the
puffs
of
smoke
ran
along
the
scorched
flesh
and
the
detonations
recommenced
wherever
he
rushed
twisting
his
massive
body
in
his
struggles
to
get
the
darts
out
of
his
neck
the
infernal
detonations
went
with
him
but
now
his
movements
were
less
violent
it
seemed
as
though
his
vigorous
animalism
was
being
subdued
by
the
torture
a
third
pair
of
darts
were
fixed
in
and
from
the
burning
flesh
a
nauseous
odour
of
melted
fat
burnt
hide
and
singed
hair
spread
throughout
the
arena
the
public
still
applauded
with
vindictive
frenzy
as
if
the
poor
animal
were
an
opponent
of
their
religious
beliefs
and
they
were
performing
a
holy
work
by
this
burning
they
laughed
as
they
saw
him
unsteady
on
his
legs
bellowing
with
sharp
screams
of
pain
seeking
in
vain
for
something
to
cool
his
tongue
gallardo
awaited
leaning
on
the
barrier
near
the
presidential
box
the
signal
to
kill
while
garabato
held
the
rapier
and
muleta
ready
prepared
resting
on
the
top
of
the
barrier
curse
him
the
corrida
had
begun
so
well
and
now
evil
fate
had
reserved
this
bull
for
him
a
bull
moreover
of
his
own
choosing
on
account
of
his
fine
appearance
and
who
now
he
was
in
the
arena
turned
out
a
cur
he
excused
himself
beforehand
to
the
connoisseurs
who
were
leaning
over
the
barrier
for
his
probably
indifferent
work
i
will
do
what
i
can
but
it
probably
wo
be
much
said
he
shrugging
his
shoulders
then
he
glanced
round
the
boxes
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
one
occupied
by
doña
sol
she
had
applauded
him
before
when
he
executed
his
stupendous
exploit
of
lying
down
before
the
bull
her
gloved
hands
had
clapped
enthusiastically
when
he
had
turned
towards
the
barrier
saluting
the
audience
now
when
she
realised
that
the
torero
was
looking
at
her
she
saluted
him
with
a
kindly
gesture
and
even
her
companion
that
odious
fellow
made
a
stiff
bow
as
if
he
were
breaking
in
two
at
the
waist
he
had
surprised
her
several
times
with
her
fixed
persistently
on
him
or
searching
for
him
when
he
retired
behind
the
barriers
ah
that
gachi
possibly
she
felt
once
more
attracted
by
his
courage
gallardo
thought
he
would
go
and
see
her
the
following
day
possibly
the
wind
might
have
changed
the
trumpets
gave
the
signal
to
kill
and
the
espada
after
making
a
short
brindis
walked
towards
the
bull
all
the
enthusiasts
shouted
their
advice
kill
him
quickly
he
is
an
ox
who
deserves
nothing
the
torero
spread
his
muleta
before
the
brute
who
attacked
but
slowly
as
if
warned
by
his
previous
torture
but
with
the
evident
intention
of
crushing
and
wounding
the
suffering
having
awakened
his
fierceness
that
man
was
the
first
who
had
stood
before
him
since
his
torment
began
the
crowd
felt
their
vindictive
anger
towards
the
bull
vanishing
after
all
he
was
not
turning
out
so
badly
he
was
attacking
well
olé
and
they
all
welcomed
the
torero
passes
with
delight
confounding
the
torero
and
the
bull
in
the
same
noisy
approval
the
bull
remained
motionless
his
head
lowered
his
tongue
hanging
out
there
fell
on
the
crowd
that
silence
always
preceding
the
mortal
estocade
a
silence
even
greater
than
absolute
solitude
as
it
came
from
thousands
of
breathings
the
silence
was
so
profound
that
the
slightest
noise
reached
to
the
topmost
benches
all
heard
the
rattle
of
the
pieces
of
wood
knocking
against
each
other
it
was
gallardo
who
with
the
point
of
his
rapier
was
setting
aside
the
burnt
banderillas
which
had
fallen
down
between
the
horns
after
this
arrangement
which
would
facilitate
the
mortal
stroke
the
crowd
stretched
their
necks
even
further
forward
feeling
the
mysterious
intercourse
between
their
will
and
that
of
the
matador
now
they
all
said
to
themselves
he
would
overthrow
the
bull
with
one
masterly
stroke
they
all
felt
the
espada
determination
gallardo
threw
himself
on
the
bull
and
all
the
populace
breathed
loudly
after
their
breathless
expectation
but
from
the
encounter
the
animal
emerged
rushing
with
furious
bellowing
while
the
benches
broke
out
into
whistling
and
protests
the
same
thing
had
happened
once
again
gallardo
had
turned
away
his
face
and
shortened
his
arm
at
the
moment
of
killing
the
animal
carried
off
the
rapier
in
his
neck
loose
and
bending
and
after
a
few
steps
the
steel
blade
flew
out
of
the
flesh
rolling
on
the
sand
some
of
the
people
blamed
gallardo
and
the
spell
which
had
united
them
to
the
espada
at
the
beginning
of
the
fiesta
was
broken
their
distrust
of
the
torero
reappeared
and
their
irritating
censures
all
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
late
enthusiasm
gallardo
picked
up
his
rapier
with
bent
head
and
without
the
heart
to
protest
against
the
discontent
of
a
crowd
so
tolerant
to
others
so
harsh
and
unjust
towards
himself
and
turned
again
towards
the
bull
in
his
confusion
he
thought
some
other
torero
placed
himself
by
his
side
it
was
el
nacional
steady
juan
do
get
flurried
curse
it
was
this
same
thing
always
going
to
happen
to
him
could
he
not
put
his
arm
between
the
horns
as
formerly
and
drive
the
rapier
in
up
to
the
hilt
was
he
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
as
a
for
the
public
an
ox
whom
they
had
been
obliged
to
fire
he
placed
himself
opposite
the
animal
who
seemed
waiting
for
him
steady
on
its
legs
he
thought
it
useless
to
make
any
more
passes
with
the
muleta
so
he
placed
himself
in
profile
with
the
red
cloth
hanging
on
the
ground
and
the
rapier
horizontal
at
the
height
of
his
eye
now
to
thrust
in
his
arm
with
a
sudden
impulse
the
audience
rose
to
their
feet
for
a
few
seconds
the
man
and
the
bull
formed
one
single
mass
and
so
moved
on
some
steps
the
connoisseurs
were
already
waving
their
hands
anxious
to
applaud
he
had
thrown
himself
in
to
kill
as
in
his
best
day
that
was
a
true
estocade
but
suddenly
the
man
was
thrown
out
from
between
the
horns
by
a
crushing
blow
and
rolled
on
the
sand
the
bull
lowered
his
head
picking
up
the
inert
body
lifting
it
for
an
instant
on
his
horns
to
let
it
fall
again
then
rushing
on
his
mad
career
with
the
rapier
plunged
up
to
the
hilt
in
his
neck
gallardo
rose
slowly
the
whole
plaza
burst
out
into
uproarious
deafening
applause
anxious
to
repair
their
injustice
olé
for
the
man
well
done
the
lad
from
seville
he
had
been
splendid
but
the
torero
did
not
acknowledge
these
outbursts
of
enthusiasm
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
stomach
crouching
in
a
painful
curve
and
with
his
head
bent
began
to
walk
forward
with
uncertain
step
twice
he
raised
his
head
as
if
he
were
looking
for
the
door
of
exit
and
fearing
not
to
be
able
to
find
it
finally
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
and
falling
flat
on
the
sand
four
of
the
plaza
servants
raised
him
slowly
on
their
shoulders
el
nacional
joining
the
group
to
support
the
espada
pale
livid
head
with
its
glassy
eyes
just
showing
through
the
long
lashes
the
audience
started
with
surprise
and
their
plaudits
ceased
suddenly
they
looked
around
at
each
other
unable
to
make
up
their
minds
as
to
the
gravity
of
the
accident
soon
optimistic
news
circulated
but
no
one
knew
from
whence
it
came
it
was
nothing
only
a
tremendous
blow
in
the
stomach
which
had
deprived
him
of
consciousness
but
no
one
had
seen
any
blood
the
populace
suddenly
tranquilized
sat
down
turning
their
attention
from
the
wounded
torero
to
the
bull
who
though
in
the
agonies
of
death
still
remained
firm
on
his
feet
el
nacional
helped
to
place
his
master
on
a
bed
in
the
infirmary
he
fell
on
it
like
a
sack
inanimate
his
arms
hanging
over
either
side
of
the
bed
sebastian
who
had
so
often
seen
the
espada
bleeding
and
wounded
without
ever
losing
his
calm
now
felt
the
agony
of
fear
seeing
him
lifeless
with
his
face
of
a
greenish
whiteness
as
if
he
were
already
dead
by
the
life
of
the
blue
dove
he
groaned
are
there
no
doctors
is
there
no
help
anywhere
the
infirmary
doctors
after
attending
to
the
injured
picador
had
run
back
to
their
box
in
the
plaza
the
banderillero
was
in
despair
seconds
seemed
hours
as
he
shouted
to
garabato
and
potaje
to
come
and
help
him
not
knowing
quite
what
he
said
to
them
the
doctors
arrived
and
after
closing
the
door
to
remain
undisturbed
they
stood
undecidedly
before
the
espada
inanimate
body
they
must
undress
him
and
garabato
began
to
unpin
unsew
and
tear
the
clothes
el
nacional
hardly
saw
the
body
the
doctors
were
surrounding
the
wounded
man
consulting
each
other
by
their
looks
it
must
be
a
collapse
which
had
apparently
deprived
him
of
life
there
was
no
blood
to
be
seen
and
the
rents
in
his
clothes
were
no
doubt
the
result
of
his
toss
by
the
bull
doctor
ruiz
entered
hurriedly
the
other
doctors
making
way
for
him
acknowledging
his
superiority
he
swore
in
his
nervous
hurry
as
he
helped
garabato
to
undo
the
torero
clothes
there
was
a
start
of
wonder
of
painful
surprise
round
the
bed
the
banderillero
did
not
dare
to
enquire
he
looked
between
the
heads
at
gallardo
body
his
shirt
was
drawn
up
and
he
saw
that
the
stomach
which
was
uncovered
was
torn
by
a
jagged
wound
with
bloody
lips
from
between
which
the
bluish
viscera
were
protruding
doctor
ruiz
shook
his
head
sadly
besides
the
terrible
and
incurable
wound
the
torero
had
received
a
tremendous
shock
from
the
bull
head
he
was
no
longer
breathing
doctor
doctor
moaned
the
banderillero
imploring
to
know
the
truth
and
doctor
ruiz
after
a
long
silence
turned
his
head
it
is
finished
sebastian
you
must
seek
another
matador
el
nacional
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
was
it
possible
that
such
a
man
should
die
in
this
way
unable
to
clasp
a
friend
hand
unable
to
say
a
word
suddenly
like
a
wretched
rabbit
whose
neck
you
wring
despair
drove
him
from
the
infirmary
ay
he
could
not
stay
and
look
at
he
was
not
like
potaje
who
stood
motionless
and
frowning
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
twisting
his
beaver
in
his
hand
looking
at
the
body
as
if
he
saw
it
not
in
the
courtyard
he
had
to
stand
aside
to
let
some
picadors
pass
who
were
returning
to
the
circus
the
terrible
news
had
begun
to
run
through
the
plaza
gallardo
was
dead
some
doubted
the
truth
of
the
news
others
affirmed
it
but
no
one
moved
from
their
seats
they
were
going
to
loose
the
third
bull
the
corrida
was
only
in
its
first
half
and
they
really
could
not
give
it
up
through
the
great
doorway
came
the
noise
of
the
crowd
and
the
sound
of
music
the
banderillero
felt
a
fierce
hatred
arise
in
his
heart
for
everything
surrounding
him
a
disgust
and
aversion
to
his
profession
and
to
those
who
maintained
it
he
thought
of
the
bull
who
was
now
being
dragged
out
of
the
arena
with
his
neck
burnt
and
bloody
his
legs
stiff
and
his
glassy
eyes
gazing
up
at
the
sky
then
he
thought
of
the
friend
lying
dead
a
few
paces
from
him
only
the
other
side
of
a
brick
wall
his
limbs
also
rigid
his
stomach
ripped
open
and
a
mysterious
dull
light
shining
through
his
half
open
eyelids
poor
bull
poor
espada
and
suddenly
as
noisy
cries
of
delight
burst
out
in
the
circus
applauding
the
continuation
of
the
spectacle
el

his
eyes
and

his
fists
