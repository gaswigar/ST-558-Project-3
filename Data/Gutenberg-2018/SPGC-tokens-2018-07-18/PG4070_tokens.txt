introduction
by

archer
introduction
with
master
or
builder
as
the
title
runs
in
the
original
we
enter
upon
the
final
stage
in
ibsen
career
you
are
essentially
right
the
poet
wrote
to
count
prozor
in
march
when
you
say
that
the
series
which
closes
with
the
epilogue
we
dead
began
with
builder
ibsen
says
brahm
wrote
in
christiania
all
the
four
works
which
he
thus
seems
to
bracket
together
and
we
dead
he
returned
to
norway
in
july
for
a
stay
of
indefinite
length
but
the
restless
wanderer
over
europe
was
destined
to
leave
his
home
no
more
he
had
not
returned
however
to
throw
himself
as
of
old
into
the
battle
of
the
passing
day
polemics
are
entirely
absent
from
the
poetry
of
his
old
age
he
leaves
the
state
and
society
at
peace
he
who
had
departed
as
the
creator
of
falk
in
now
on
his
return
gazes
into
the
secret
places
of
human
nature
and
the
wonder
of
his
own
soul
brahm
however
seems
to
be
mistaken
in
thinking
that
ibsen
returned
to
norway
with
no
definite
intention
of
settling
down
julius
elias
an
excellent
authority
reports
that
shortly
before
ibsen
left
munich
in
he
remarked
one
day
i
must
get
back
to
the
north
is
that
a
sudden
impulse
asked
elias
oh
no
was
the
reply
i
want
to
be
a
good
head
of
a
household
and
have
my
affairs
in
order
to
that
end
i
must
consolidate
may
property
lay
it
down
in
good
securities
and
get
it
under
control
and
that
one
can
best
do
where
one
has
rights
of
citizenship
some
critics
will
no
doubt
be
shocked
to
find
the
poet
whom
they
have
written
down
an
anarchist
confessing
such
bourgeois
motives
after
his
return
to
norway
ibsen
correspondence
became
very
scant
and
we
have
no
letters
dating
from
the
period
when
he
was
at
work
on
master
on
the
other
hand
we
possess
a
curious
lyrical
prelude
to
the
play
which
he
put
on
paper
on
march
it
is
said
to
have
been
his
habit
before
setting
to
work
on
a
play
to
crystallise
in
a
poem
the
mood
which
then
possessed
him
but
the
following
is
the
only
one
of
these
keynote
poems
which
has
been
published
i
give
it
in
the
original
language
with
a
literal
translation

they
sat
there
the
two
they
sat
there
the
two
in
so
cosy
a
house
through
autumn
and
winter
days
then
the
house
burned
down
everything
lies
in
ruins
the
two
must
grope
among
the
ashes
for
among
them
is
hidden
a
jewel
a
jewel
that
never
can
burn
and
if
they
search
faithfully
it
may
easily
happen
that
he
or
she
may
find
it
but
even
should
they
find
it
the
two
find
this
precious
unburnable
jewel
never
will
she
find
her
burnt
faith
he
never
his
burnt
happiness
this
is
the
latest
piece
of
ibsen
verse
that
has
been
given
to
the
world
but
one
of
his
earliest
poems
first
printed
in
was
also
in
some
sort
a
prelude
to
master
of
this
a
literal
translation
may
suffice
it
is
called
i
remember
as
clearly
as
if
it
had
been
the
evening
when
in
the
paper
i
saw
my
first
poem
in
print
there
i
sat
in
my
den
and
with
puffs
i
smoked
and
i
dreamed
in
blissful
i
will
build
a
it
shall
shine
all
over
the
north
it
shall
have
two
wings
one
little
and
one
great
the
great
wing
shall
shelter
a
deathless
poet
the
little
wing
shall
serve
as
a
young
girl
bower
the
plan
seemed
to
me
nobly
harmonious
but
as
time
went
on
it
fell
into
confusion
when
the
master
grew
reasonable
the
castle
turned
utterly
crazy
the
great
wing
became
too
little
the
little
wing
fell
to
ruin
thus
we
see
that
years
before
the
date
of
master
ibsen
imagination
was
preoccupied
with
a
symbol
of
a
master
building
a
castle
in
the
air
and
a
young
girl
in
one
of
its
towers
there
has
been
some
competition
among
the
poet
young
lady
friends
for
the
honour
of
having
served
as
his
model
for
hilda
several
no
doubt
are
entitled
to
some
share
in
it
one
is
not
surprised
to
learn
that
among
the
papers
he
left
behind
were
sheaves
upon
sheaves
of
letters
from
women
all
these
ladies
says
julius
elias
demanded
something
of
him
some
cure
for
their
agonies
of
soul
or
for
the
incomprehension
from
which
they
suffered
some
solution
of
the
riddle
of
their
nature
almost
every
one
of
them
regarded
herself
as
a
problem
to
which
ibsen
could
not
but
have
the
time
and
the
interest
to
apply
himself
they
all
thought
they
had
a
claim
on
the
creator
of
nora
of
this
chapter
of
his
experience
fru
ibsen
spoke
with
ironic
humour
i
have
often
said
to
him
ibsen
keep
these
swarms
of
womenfolk
at
arm
length
no
he
would
reply
let
them
alone
i
want
to
observe
them
more
closely
his
observations
would
take
a
longer
or
shorter
time
as
the
case
might
be
and
would
always
contribute
to
some
work
of
art
the
principal
model
for
hilda
was
doubtless
fraulein
emilie
bardach
of
vienna
whom
he
met
at
gossensass
in
the
autumn
of
he
was
then
years
of
age
she
is
said
to
have
been
seventeen
as
the
lady
herself
handed
his
letters
to
brandes
for
publication
there
can
be
no
indiscretion
in
speaking
of
them
freely
some
passages
from
them
i
have
quoted
in
the
introduction
to
passages
which
show
that
at
first
the
poet
deliberately
put
aside
his
gossensass
impressions
for
use
when
he
should
stand
at
a
greater
distance
from
them
and
meanwhile
devoted
himself
to
work
in
a
totally
different
key
on
october
he
writes
in
his
second
letter
to
fraulein
bardach
i
can
not
repress
my
summer
memories
nor
do
i
want
to
i
live
through
my
experiences
again
and
again
to
transmute
it
all
into
a
poem
i
find
in
the
meantime
impossible
in
the
meantime
shall
i
succeed
in
doing
so
some
time
in
the
future
and
do
i
really
wish
to
succeed
in
the
meantime
at
any
rate
i
do
not
and
yet
it
must
come
in
time
the
letters
number
twelve
in
all
and
are
couched
in
a
tone
of
sentimental
regret
for
the
brief
bright
summer
days
of
their
acquaintanceship
the
keynote
is
struck
in
the
inscription
on
the
back
of
a
photograph
which
he
gave
her
before
they
parted
die
maisonne
eines
septemberlebens
in
in
her
album
he
had
written
the
words
hohes
schmerzliches
gluck
um
das
unerreichbare
zu
ringen
in
which
we
may
if
we
like
see
a
foreshadowing
of
the
solness
frame
of
mind
in
the
fifth
letter
of
the
series
he
refers
to
her
as
an
enigmatic
princess
in
the
sixth
he
twice
calls
her
my
dear
princess
but
this
is
the
only
point
at
which
the
letters
quite
definitely
and
unmistakably
point
forward
to
master
in
the
ninth
letter
february
he
says
i
feel
it
a
matter
of
conscience
to
end
or
at
any
rate
to
restrict
our
correspondence
the
tenth
letter
six
months
later
is
one
of
kindly
condolence
on
the
death
of
the
young
lady
father
in
the
eleventh
very
short
note
dated
december
he
acknowledges
some
small
gift
but
says
please
for
the
present
do
not
write
me
again
i
will
soon
send
you
my
new
play
receive
it
in
friendship
but
in
silence
this
injunction
she
apparently
obeyed
when
master
appeared
it
would
seem
that
ibsen
did
not
even
send
her
a
copy
of
the
play
and
we
gather
that
he
was
rather
annoyed
when
she
sent
him
a
photograph
signed
princess
of
orangia
on
his
seventieth
birthday
however
she
telegraphed
her
congratulations
to
which
he
returned
a
very
cordial
reply
and
here
their
relations
ended
that
she
was
right
however
in
regarding
herself
as
his
principal
model
for
hilda
appears
from
an
anecdote
related
by
dr
elias
it
is
not
an
altogether
pleasing
anecdote
but
elias
is
an
unexceptionable
witness
and
it
can
by
no
means
be
omitted
from
an
examination
into
the
origins
of
master
ibsen
had
come
to
berlin
in
february
for
the
first
performance
of
such
experiences
were
always
a
trial
to
him
and
he
felt
greatly
relieved
when
they
were
over
packing
too
he
detested
and
elias
having
helped
him
through
this
terrible
ordeal
the
two
sat
down
to
lunch
together
while
awaiting
the
train
an
expansive
mood
descended
upon
ibsen
and
chuckling
over
his
champagne
glass
he
said
do
you
know
my
next
play
is
already
hovering
before
me
of
course
in
vague
outline
but
of
one
thing
i
have
got
firm
hold
an
experience
a
woman
figure
very
interesting
very
interesting
indeed
again
a
spice
of
the
devilry
in
it
then
he
related
how
he
had
met
in
the
tyrol
a
viennese
girl
of
very
remarkable
character
she
had
at
once
made
him
her
confidant
the
gist
of
her
confessions
was
that
she
did
not
care
a
bit
about
one
day
marrying
a
well
young
man
most
likely
she
would
never
marry
what
tempted
and
charmed
and
delighted
her
was
to
lure
other
women
husbands
away
from
them
she
was
a
little
daemonic
wrecker
she
often
appeared
to
him
like
a
little
bird
of
prey
that
would
fain
have
made
him
too
her
booty
he
had
studied
her
very
very
closely
for
the
rest
she
had
had
no
great
success
with
him
she
did
not
get
hold
of
me
but
i
got
hold
of
her
for
my
play
then
i
fancy
here
he
chuckled
again
she
consoled
herself
with
some
one
else
love
seemed
to
mean
for
her
only
a
sort
of
morbid
imagination
this
however
was
only
one
side
of
her
nature
his
little
model
had
had
a
great
deal
of
heart
and
of
womanly
understanding
and
thanks
to
the
spontaneous
power
she
could
gain
over
him
every
woman
might
if
she
wished
it
guide
some
man
towards
the
good
thus
ibsen
spoke
says
elias
calmly
and
coolly
gazing
as
it
were
into
the
far
distance
like
an
artist
taking
an
objective
view
of
some
experience
like
lubek
speaking
of
his
he
had
stolen
a
soul
and
put
it
to
a
double
employment
thea
elvsted
and
hilda
wangel
are
intimately
related
are
indeed
only
different
expressions
of
the
same
nature
if
ibsen
actually
declared
thea
and
hilda
to
be
drawn
from
one
model
we
must
of
course
take
his
word
for
it
but
the
relationship
is
hard
to
discern
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
then
that
the
gossensass
episode
gave
the
primary
impulse
to
master
but
it
seems
pretty
well
established
too
that
another
lady
whom
he
met
in
christiania
after
his
return
in
also
contributed
largely
to
the
character
of
hilda
this
may
have
been
the
reason
why
he
resented
fraulein
appropriating
to
herself
the
title
of
princess
of
orangia
the
play
was
published
in
the
middle
of
december
it
was
acted
both
in
germany
and
england
before
it
was
seen
in
the
scandinavian
capitals
its
first
performance
took
place
at
the
lessing
theatre
berlin
january
with
emanuel
reicher
as
solness
and
frl
reisenhofer
as
hilda
in
london
it
was
first
performed
at
the
trafalgar
square
theatre
now
the
duke
of
york
on
february
under
the
direction
of
herbert
waring
and
miss
elizabeth
robins
who
played
solness
and
hilda
this
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
successful
of
english
ibsen
productions
miss
robins
was
almost
an
ideal
hilda
and
solness
was
exceedingly
able
some
thirty
performances
were
give
in
all
and
the
play
was
reproduced
at
the
opera
comique
later
in
the
season
with
lewis
waller
as
solness
in
the
following
year
miss
robins
acted
hilda
in
manchester
in
christiania
and
copenhagen
the
play
was
produced
on
the
same
evening
march
the
copenhagen
solness
and
hilda
were
emil
poulsen
and
fru
hennings
a
swedish
production
by
lindberg
soon
followed
both
in
stockholm
and
gothenburg
in
paris
le
was
not
seen
until
april
when
it
was
produced
by
with
as
solness
the
company
sometimes
with
mme
suzanne
despres
and
sometimes
with
mme
berthe
bady
as
hilda
in
and
presented
the
play
in
london
brussels
amsterdam
milan
and
other
cities
in
october
they
visited
christiania
where
ibsen
was
present
at
one
of
their
performances
and
is
reported
by
herman
bang
to
have
been
so
enraptured
with
it
that
he
exclaimed
this
is
the
resurrection
of
my
play
on
this
occasion
mme
bady
was
the
hilda
the
first
performance
of
the
play
in
america
took
place
at
the
carnegie
lyceum
new
york
on
january
with
william
pascoe
as
solness
and
miss
florence
kahn
as
hilda
the
performance
was
repeated
in
the
course
of
the
same
month
both
at
washington
and
boston
in
england
and
probably
elsewhere
as
well
master
produced
a
curious
double
effect
it
alienated
many
of
the
staunchest
admirers
and
it
powerfully
attracted
many
people
who
had
hitherto
been
hostile
to
him
looking
back
it
is
easy
to
see
why
this
should
have
been
so
for
here
was
certainly
a
new
thing
in
drama
which
could
not
but
set
up
many
novel
reactions
a
greater
contrast
could
scarcely
be
imagined
than
that
between
the
hard
cold
precise
outlines
of
and
the
vague
mysterious
atmosphere
of
master
in
which
though
the
dialogue
is
sternly
restrained
within
the
limits
of
prose
the
art
of
drama
seems
for
ever
on
the
point
of
floating
away
to
blend
with
the
art
of
music
substantially
the
play
is
one
long
dialogue
between
solness
and
hilda
and
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
analyse
this
dialogue
in
terms
of
music
noting
for
example
the
announcement
first
of
this
theme
and
then
of
that
the
resumption
and
reinforcement
of
a
theme
which
seemed
to
have
been
dropped
the
contrapuntal
interweaving
of
two
or
more
motives
a
scherzo
here
a
fugal
passage
there
leaving
this
exercise
to
some
one
more
skilled
in
music
or
less
unskilled
than
myself
i
may
note
that
in
master
ibsen
resumes
his
favourite
retrospective
method
from
which
in
he
had
in
great
measure
departed
but
the
retrospect
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
is
purely
psychological
the
external
events
involved
in
it
are
few
and
simple
in
comparison
with
the
external
events
which
are
successively
unveiled
in
retrospective
passages
of
wild
or
the
matter
of
the
play
is
the
of
halvard
solness
recounted
to
an
impassioned
listener
so
impassioned
indeed
that
the
it
begets
in
her
form
an
absorbing
and
thrilling
drama
the
graduations
retardations
accelerations
of
solness
are
managed
with
the
subtlest
art
so
as
to
keep
the
interest
of
the
spectator
ever
on
the
stretch
the
technical
method
was
not
new
it
was
simply
that
which
ibsen
had
been
perfecting
from
of
onward
but
it
was
applied
to
a
subject
of
a
nature
not
only
new
to
him
but
new
to
literature
that
the
play
is
full
of
symbolism
it
would
be
futile
to
deny
and
the
symbolism
is
mainly
autobiographic
the
churches
which
solness
sets
out
building
doubtless
represent
ibsen
early
romantic
plays
the
homes
for
human
beings
his
social
drama
while
the
houses
with
high
towers
merging
into
castles
in
the
air
stand
for
those
spiritual
dramas
with
a
wide
outlook
over
the
metaphysical
environment
of
humanity
on
which
he
was
henceforth
to
be
engaged
perhaps
it
is
not
altogether
fanciful
to
read
a
personal
reference
into
solness
refusal
to
call
himself
an
architect
on
the
ground
that
his
training
has
not
been
systematic
that
he
is
a
man
ibsen
too
was
in
all
essentials
his
philosophy
was
entirely
unsystematic
and
like
solness
he
was
no
student
of
books
there
may
be
an
introspective
note
also
in
that
dread
of
the
younger
generation
to
which
solness
confesses
it
is
certain
that
the
old
was
not
lavish
of
his
certificates
of
competence
to
young
aspirants
though
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
his
reticence
ever
depressed
or
quenched
any
rising
genius
on
the
whole
then
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
several
symbolic
motives
are
inwoven
into
the
iridescent
fabric
of
the
play
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
regard
it
as
essentially
and
inseparably
a
piece
of
symbolism
essentially
it
is
a
history
of
a
sickly
conscience
worked
out
in
terms
of
pure
psychology
or
rather
it
is
a
study
of
a
sickly
and
a
robust
conscience
side
by
side
the
conscience
is
very
conservative
ibsen
has
somewhere
said
and
here
solness
conservatism
is
contrasted
with
hilda
radicalism
or
rather
radicalism
for
we
are
led
to
suspect
towards
the
close
that
the
radical
too
is
a
conservative
in
spite
or
herself
the
fact
that
solness
can
not
climb
as
high
as
he
builds
implies
i
take
it
that
he
can
not
act
as
freely
as
he
thinks
or
as
hilda
would
goad
him
into
thinking
at
such
an
altitude
his
conscience
would
turn
dizzy
and
life
would
become
impossible
to
him
but
here
i
am
straying
back
to
the
interpretation
of
symbols
my
present
purpose
is
to
insist
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
play
which
has
no
meaning
on
the
plane
and
absolutely
requires
a
symbolic
interpretation
to
make
it
comprehensible
the
symbols
are
harmonic
undertones
the
psychological
melody
is
clear
and
consistent
without
any
reference
to
them
it
is
true
that
in
order
to
accept
the
action
on
what
we
may
call
the
realistic
level
we
must
suppose
solness
to
possess
and
to
exercise
sometimes
unconsciously
a
considerable
measure
of
hypnotic
power
but
time
is
surely
past
when
we
could
reckon
hypnotism
among
supernatural
phenomena
whether
the
particular
forms
of
hypnotic
influence
attributed
to
solness
do
actually
exist
is
a
question
we
need
not
determine
the
poet
does
not
demand
our
absolute
credence
as
though
he
were
giving
evidence
in
the
what
he
requires
is
our
imaginative
acceptance
of
certain
incidents
which
he
purposely
leaves
hovering
on
the
border
between
the
natural
and
the
preternatural
the
explained
and
the
unexplained
in
this
play
as
in
lady
from
the
and
he
shows
a
delicacy
of
art
in
his
dalliance
with
the
occult
which
irresistibly
recalls
the
exquisite
genius
of
nathaniel
hawthorne
the
critics
who
insist
on
finding
nothing
but
symbolism
in
the
play
have
fastened
on
solness
nine
lovely
dolls
and
provided
the
most
amazing
interpretations
for
them
a
letter
which
i
contributed
in
to
the
records
an
incident
which
throws
a
curious
light
on
the
subject
and
may
be
worth
preserving
at
a
recent
first
night
i
wrote
i
happened
to
be
seated
just
behind
a
critic
he
turned
round
to
me
and
said
want
you
to
tell
me
what
is
your
theory
of
those
nine
lovely
dolls
of
course
one
can
see
that
they
are
entirely
symbolical
am
not
so
sure
of
that
i
replied
remembering
a
norwegian
cousin
of
my
own
who
treasured
a
favourite
doll
until
she
was
nearer
thirty
than
twenty
of
course
symbolise
the
unsatisfied
passion
of
motherhood
in
solness
heart
but
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
ibsen
makes
use
of
this
symbol
because
he
has
observed
a
similar
case
or
cases
in
real
life
cried
the
critic
has
seen
a
a
woman
continuing
to
live
with
her
dolls
i
was
about
to
say
that
it
did
not
seem
to
me
so
very
improbable
when
a
lady
who
was
seated
next
me
a
total
stranger
to
both
of
us
leant
forward
and
said
my
interrupting
you
but
it
may
perhaps
interest
you
to
know
that
i
have
three
dolls
to
which
i
am
deeply
attached
i
will
not
be
so
rude
as
to
conjecture
this
age
but
we
may
be
sure
that
a
very
young
woman
would
not
have
had
the
courage
to
make
such
an
avowal
does
it
not
seem
that
ibsen
knows
a
thing
or
two
about
human
nature
english
as
well
as
norwegian
which
we
dramatic
critics
though
bound
by
our
calling
to
be
subtle
psychologists
have
not
yet
fathomed
in
the
course
of
the
correspondence
which
followed
one
very
apposite
anecdote
was
quoted
from
an
american
paper
the
an
old
virginia
lady
said
to
a
friend
on
finding
a
treasured
old
cup
cracked
by
a
careless
maid
know
of
nothing
to
compare
with
the
affliction
of
losing
a
handsome
piece
of
old
china
said
the
friend
is
not
so
bad
as
losing
one
children
it
is
replied
the
old
lady
when
your
children
die
you
do
have
the
consolations
of
religion
you
know
it
would
be
a
paradox
to
call
master
ibsen
greatest
work
but
one
of
his
three
or
four
greatest
it
assuredly
is
of
all
his
writings
it
is
probably
the
most
original
the
most
individual
the
most
unlike
any
other
drama
by
any
other
writer
the
form
of
and
was
doubtless
suggested
by
other
dramatic
poems
notably
by
in
wild
in
in
even
in
and
gabriel
there
remain
faint
traces
of
the
french
leaven
which
is
so
strong
in
the
earlier
plays
but
master
had
no
model
and
has
no
parallel
it
shows
no
slightest
vestige
of
outside
influence
it
is
ibsen
and
nothing
but
ibsen
to
the
of
a
september
life
in
tyrol
high
painful
happiness
to
struggle
for
the
unattainable
deutsche
december
this
conception
i
have
worked
out
at
much
greater
length
in
an
essay
entitled
melody
of
the
master
appended
to
the
shilling
edition
of
the
play
published
in
i
there
retell
the
story
transplanting
it
to
england
and
making
the
hero
a
journalist
instead
of
an
architect
in
order
to
show
that
if
we
grant
the
reality
of
certain
phenomena
of
hypnotism
there
is
nothing
incredible
or
even
extravagantly
improbable
about
it
the
argument
is
far
too
long
to
be
included
here
but
the
reader
who
is
interested
in
the
subject
may
find
it
worth
referring
to
for
an
instance
of
the
technical
methods
by
which
he
suggested
the
supernormal
element

with
in

with

with

anxiously
oh
no

do

doing

better
wait

healthy
and
vigorous
with
curly
hair
dark

wears

with
an
upstanding
collar

he

one
or

light
portfolios

near

in

are
they
gone
kaia
softly
shaking
her
no
she
takes
the
shade
off
her

solness
crosses
the

throws
his
hat
on
a
chair
places
the
portfolios
on
the
table
by
the
sofa
and
approaches
the
desk
again
kaia
goes
on
writing
without
intermission
but
seems
nervous
and
uneasy
solness
aloud
what
is
that
you
are
entering
miss
fosli
kaia
starts
oh
it
is
only
something
that
solness
let
me
look
at
it
miss
fosli
bends
over
her
pretends
to
be
looking
into
the
ledger
and
whispers
kaia
kaia
softly
still
writing
well
solness
why
do
you
always
take
that
shade
off
when
i
come
kaia
as
before
i
look
so
ugly
with
it
on
solness
smiling
then
you
do
like
to
look
ugly
kaia
kaia
half
glancing
up
at
him
not
for
all
the
world
not
in
your
eyes
solness
strokes
her
hair
gently
poor
poor
little
kaia
kaia
bending
her
head
hush
they
can
hear
you
solness
strolls
across
the
room
to
the
right
turns
and
pauses
at
the
door
of
the
draughtsmen
office
solness
has
any
one
been
here
for
me
ragnar
rising
yes
the
young
couple
who
want
a
villa
built
out
at
lovstrand
solness
growling
oh
those
two
they
must
wait
i
am
not
quite
clear
about
the
plans
yet
ragnar
advancing
with
some
hesitation
they
were
very
anxious
to
have
the
drawings
at
once
solness
as
before
yes
of
course
so
they
all
are
brovik
looks
up
they
say
they
are
longing
so
to
get
into
a
house
of
their
own
solness
yes
yes
we
know
all
that
and
so
they
are
content
to
take
whatever
is
offered
them
they
get
a
a
roof
over
their
heads
an
address
but
nothing
to
call
a
home
no
thank
you
in
that
case
let
them
apply
to
somebody
else
tell
them
that
the
next
time
they
call
brovik
pushes
his
glasses
up
on
to
his
forehead
and
looks
in
astonishment
at
him
to
somebody
else
are
you
prepared
to
give
up
the
commission
solness
impatiently
yes
yes
yes
devil
take
it
if
that
is
to
be
the
way
of
it
rather
that
than
build
away
at
random
vehemently
besides
i
know
very
little
about
these
people
as
yet
brovik
the
people
are
safe
enough
ragnar
knows
them
he
is
a
friend
of
the
family
solness
oh
safe
safe
enough
that
is
not
at
all
what
i
mean
good
lord
you
understand
me
either
angrily
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
these
strangers
they
may
apply
to
whom
they
please
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
brovik
rising
do
you
really
mean
that
solness
sulkily
yes
i
for
once
in
a
way
he
comes
forward
brovik
exchanges
a
glance
with
ragnar
who
makes
a
warning
gesture
then
brovik
comes
into
the
front
room
brovik
may
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
solness
certainly
brovik
to
kaia
just
go
in
there
for
moment
kaia
kaia
uneasily
oh
but
uncle
brovik
do
as
i
say
child
and
shut
the
door
after
you
kaia
goes
reluctantly
into
the
draughtsmen
office
glances
anxiously
and
imploringly
at
solness
and
shuts
the
door
brovik
lowering
his
voice
a
little
i
do
want
the
poor
children
to
know
how
i
am
solness
yes
you
have
been
looking
very
poorly
of
late
brovik
it
will
soon
be
all
over
with
me
my
strength
is
ebbing
from
day
to
day
solness
wo
you
sit
down
brovik
thanks
may
i
solness
placing
the
more
conveniently
here
take
this
and
now
brovik
has
seated
himself
with
difficulty
well
you
see
it
about
ragnar
that
is
what
weighs
most
upon
me
what
is
to
become
of
him
solness
of
course
your
son
will
stay
with
me
as
long
as
ever
he
likes
brovik
but
that
is
just
what
he
does
not
like
he
feels
that
he
can
not
stay
here
any
longer
solness
why
i
should
say
he
was
very
well
off
here
but
if
he
wants
more
money
i
should
not
mind
brovik
no
no
it
is
not
that
impatiently
but
sooner
or
later
he
too
must
have
a
chance
of
doing
something
on
his
own
account
solness
without
looking
at
him
do
you
think
that
ragnar
has
quite
talent
enough
to
stand
alone
brovik
no
that
is
just
the
heartbreaking
part
of
it
i
have
begun
to
have
my
doubts
about
the
boy
for
you
have
never
said
so
much
as
as
one
encouraging
word
about
him
and
yet
i
can
not
but
think
there
must
be
something
in
him
he
ca
be
without
talent
solness
well
but
he
has
learnt
nothing
nothing
thoroughly
i
mean
except
of
course
to
draw
brovik
looks
at
him
with
covert
hatred
and
says
hoarsely
you
had
learned
little
enough
of
the
business
when
you
were
in
my
employment
but
that
did
not
prevent
you
from
setting
to
work
breathing
with
difficulty
and
pushing
your
way
up
and
taking
the
wind
out
of
my
sails
mine
and
so
may
other
people
solness
yes
you
see
circumstances
favoured
me
brovik
you
are
right
there
everything
favoured
you
but
then
how
can
you
have
the
heart
to
let
me
go
to
my
grave
without
having
seen
what
ragnar
is
fit
for
and
of
course
i
am
anxious
to
see
them
married
too
before
i
go
solness
sharply
is
it
she
who
wishes
it
brovik
not
kaia
so
much
as
ragnar
he
talks
about
it
every
day
appealingly
you
must
help
him
to
get
some
independent
work
now
i
must
see
something
that
the
lad
has
done
do
you
hear
solness
peevishly
hang
it
man
you
ca
expect
me
to
drag
commissions
down
from
the
moon
for
him
brovik
he
has
the
chance
of
a
capital
commission
at
this
very
moment
a
big
bit
of
work
solness
uneasily
startled
has
he
brovik
i
you
would
give
your
consent
solness
what
sort
of
work
do
you
mean
brovik
with
some
hesitation
he
can
have
the
building
of
that
villa
out
at
lovstrand
solness
that
why
i
am
going
to
build
that
myself
brovik
oh
you
do
much
care
about
doing
it
solness
flaring
up
do
care
who
dares
to
say
that
brovik
you
said
so
yourself
just
now
solness
oh
never
mind
what
i
would
they
give
ragnar
the
building
of
that
villa
brovik
yes
you
see
he
knows
the
family
and
then
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
he
has
made
drawings
and
estimates
and
so
forth
solness
are
they
pleased
with
the
drawings
the
people
who
will
have
to
live
in
the
house
brovik
yes
if
you
would
only
look
through
them
and
approve
of
them
solness
then
they
would
let
ragnar
build
their
home
for
them
brovik
they
were
immensely
pleased
with
his
idea
they
thought
it
exceedingly
original
they
said
solness
oho
original
not
the
stuff
that
am
in
the
habit
of
turning
out
brovik
it
seemed
to
them
different
solness
with
suppressed
irritation
so
it
was
to
see
ragnar
that
they
came
here
whilst
i
was
out
brovik
they
came
to
call
upon
you
and
at
the
same
time
to
ask
whether
you
would
mind
retiring
solness
angrily
retire
i
brovik
in
case
you
thought
that
ragnar
drawings
solness
i
retire
in
favour
of
your
son
brovik
retire
from
the
agreement
they
meant
solness
oh
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
laughs
angrily
so
that
is
it
is
it
halvard
solness
is
to
see
about
retiring
now
to
make
room
for
younger
men
for
the
very
youngest
perhaps
he
must
make
room
room
room
brovik
why
good
heavens
there
is
surely
room
for
more
than
one
single
man
solness
oh
there
not
so
very
much
room
to
spare
either
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
will
never
retire
i
will
never
give
way
to
anybody
never
of
my
own
free
will
never
in
this
world
will
i
do
that
brovik
rise
with
difficulty
then
i
am
to
pass
out
of
life
without
any
certainty
without
a
gleam
of
happiness
without
any
faith
or
trust
in
ragnar
without
having
seen
a
single
piece
of
work
of
his
doing
is
that
to
be
the
way
of
it
solness
turns
half
aside
and
mutters
h
do
ask
more
just
now
brovik
i
must
have
an
answer
to
this
one
question
am
i
to
pass
out
of
life
in
such
utter
poverty
solness
seems
to
struggle
with
himself
finally
he
says
in
a
low
but
firm
voice
you
must
pass
out
of
life
as
best
you
can
brovik
then
be
it
so
he
goes
up
the
room
solness
following
him
half
is
desperation
do
you
understand
that
i
can
not
help
it
i
am
what
i
am
and
i
can
not
change
my
nature
brovik
no
i
suppose
that
you
ca
reels
and
supports
himself
against
the
may
i
have
a
glass
of
water
solness
by
all
means
fills
a
glass
and
hands
it
to
him
brovik
thanks
drinks
and
puts
the
glass
down
again
solness
goes
up
and
opens
the
door
of
the
draughtsmen
office
solness
ragnar
you
must
come
and
take
your
father
home
ragnar
rises
quickly
he
and
kaia
come
into
the
ragnar
what
is
the
matter
father
brovik
give
me
your
arm
now
let
us
go
ragnar
very
well
you
had
better
put
your
things
on
too
kaia
solness
miss
fosli
must
stay
just
for
a
moment
there
is
a
letter
i
want
written
brovik
looks
at
solness
good
night
sleep
well
if
you
can
solness
good
night
brovik
and
ragnar
go
out
by
the
kaia
goes
to
the
desk
solness
stands
with
bent
head
to
the
right
by
the
kaia
dubiously
is
there
any
letter
solness
curtly
no
of
course
not
looks
sternly
at
her
kaia
kaia
anxiously
in
a
low
voice
yes
solness
points
imperatively
to
a
spot
on
the
floor
come
here
at
once
kaia
hesitatingly
yes
solness
as
before
nearer
kaia
obeying
what
do
you
want
with
me
solness
looks
at
her
for
a
while
is
it
you
i
have
to
thank
for
all
this
kaia
no
no
do
think
that
solness
but
confess
now
you
want
to
get
married
kaia
softly
ragnar
and
i
have
been
engaged
for
four
or
five
years
and
so
solness
and
so
you
think
it
time
there
were
an
end
of
it
is
not
that
so
kaia
ragnar
and
uncle
say
i
must
so
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
give
in
solness
more
gently
kaia
do
you
really
care
a
little
bit
for
ragnar
too
kaia
i
cared
very
much
for
ragnar
once
before
i
came
here
to
you
solness
but
you
do
now
not
in
the
least
kaia
passionately
clasping
hands
and
holding
them
out
towards
him
oh
you
know
very
well
there
is
only
one
person
i
care
for
now
i
shall
never
care
for
any
one
else
solness
yes
you
say
that
and
yet
you
go
away
from
me
leave
me
alone
here
with
everything
on
my
hands
kaia
but
could
i
not
stay
with
you
even
if
ragnar
solness
repudiating
the
idea
no
no
that
is
quite
impossible
if
ragnar
leaves
me
and
starts
work
on
his
own
account
then
of
course
he
will
need
you
himself
kaia
wringing
her
hands
oh
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
be
separated
from
you
it
quite
quite
impossible
solness
then
be
sure
you
get
those
foolish
notions
out
of
ragnar
head
marry
him
as
much
as
you
please
alters
his
tone
i
mean
do
let
him
throw
up
his
good
situation
with
me
for
then
i
can
keep
you
too
my
dear
kaia
kaia
oh
yes
how
lovely
that
would
be
if
it
could
only
be
managed
solness
clasps
her
head
with
his
two
hands
and
whispers
for
i
can
not
get
on
without
you
you
see
i
must
have
you
with
me
every
single
day
kaia
in
nervous
exaltation
my
god
my
god
solness
kisses
her
hair
kaia
kaia
kaia
sinks
down
before
him
oh
how
good
you
are
to
me
how
unspeakably
good
you
are
solness
vehemently
get
up
for
goodness
sake
get
up
i
think
i
hear
some
one
he
helps
her
to
rise
she
staggers
over
to
the
desk
solness
enters
by
the
door
on
the
right
she
looks
thin
and
wasted
with
grief
but
shows
traces
of
bygone
beauty
blonde
ringlets
dressed
with
good
taste
wholly
in
black
speaks
slowly
and
in
a
plaintive
voice
solness
in
the
doorway
halvard
solness
turns
oh
are
you
there
my
dear
solness
with
a
glance
at
kaia
i
am
afraid
i
am
disturbing
you
solness
not
in
the
least
miss
fosli
has
only
a
short
letter
to
write
solness
yes
so
i
see
solness
what
do
you
want
with
me
aline
solness
i
merely
wanted
to
tell
you
that
herdal
is
in
the
wo
you
come
and
see
him
halvard
solness
looks
suspiciously
at
h
is
the
doctor
so
very
anxious
to
see
me
solness
well
not
exactly
anxious
he
really
came
to
see
me
but
he
would
like
to
say
to
you
at
the
same
time
solness
laughs
to
himself
yes
i
daresay
well
you
must
ask
him
to
wait
a
little
solness
then
you
will
come
in
presently
solness
perhaps
i
will
presently
presently
dear
in
a
little
while
solness
glancing
again
at
kaia
well
now
do
forget
halvard
withdraws
and
closes
the
door
behind
her
kaia
softly
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
am
sure
solness
thinks
ill
of
me
in
some
way
solness
oh
not
in
the
least
not
more
than
usual
at
any
rate
but
all
the
same
you
had
better
go
now
kaia
kaia
yes
yes
now
i
must
go
solness
severely
and
mind
you
get
that
matter
settled
for
me
do
you
hear
kaia
oh
if
it
only
depended
on
me
solness
i
will
have
it
settled
i
say
and
too
not
a
day
later
kaia
terrified
if
there
nothing
else
for
it
i
am
quite
willing
to
break
off
the
engagement
solness
angrily
break
it
off
are
you
mad
would
you
think
of
breaking
it
off
kaia
distracted
yes
if
necessary
for
i
must
i
must
stay
here
with
you
i
ca
leave
you
that
is
utterly
utterly
impossible
solness
with
a
sudden
outburst
but
deuce
take
it
how
about
ragnar
then
ragnar
that
i
kaia
looks
at
him
with
terrified
eyes
it
is
chiefly
on
ragnar
account
that
that
you
solness
collecting
himself
no
no
of
course
not
you
do
understand
me
either
gently
and
softly
of
course
it
is
you
i
want
to
you
above
everything
kaia
but
for
that
very
reason
you
must
prevent
ragnar
too
from
throwing
up
his
situation
there
there
now
go
home
kaia
yes
yes
then
solness
good
night

moment

i
did
not
see
him

them
with
him
solness
then
just
go
and
find
them
for
me
i
might
perhaps
glance
over
them
after
all
kaia
happy

do
solness
for
your
sake
kaia

and

kindly
of
me
solness
oh

i
always
do
my
dear
little
kaia
glances
to
the
right
go
go
now
solness
and
herdal
enter
by
the
door
on
the
right
he
is
a
stoutish
elderly
man
with
a
round
face
clean
shaven
with
thin
light
hair
and
gold
spectacles
solness
still
in
the
doorway
halvard
i
can
not
keep
the
doctor
any
longer
solness
well
then
come
in
here
solness
to
kaia
who
is
turning
down
the
have
you
finished
the
letter
already
miss
fosli
kaia
in
confusion
the
letter
solness
yes
it
was
quite
a
short
one
solness
it
must
have
been
very
short
solness
you
may
go
now
miss
fosli
and
please
come
in
good
time
morning
kaia
i
will
be
sure
to
solness
she
goes
out
by
the
hall
door
solness
are
you
in
a
hurry
doctor
herdal
no
not
at
all
solness
may
i
have
a
little
chat
with
you
herdal
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
solness
then
let
us
sit
down
he
motions
the
doctor
to
take
the
and
sits
down
himself
in
the
looks
searchingly
at
him
tell
me
did
you
notice
anything
odd
about
aline
herdal
do
you
mean
just
now
when
she
was
here
solness
yes
in
her
manner
to
me
did
you
notice
anything
herdal
smiling
well
i
admit
one
could
well
avoid
noticing
that
your
wife
h
herdal
that
your
wife
is
not
particularly
fond
of
this
miss
fosli
solness
is
that
all
i
have
noticed
that
myself
herdal
and
i
must
say
i
am
scarcely
surprised
at
it
solness
at
what
herdal
that
she
should
not
exactly
approve
of
your
seeing
so
much
of
another
woman
all
day
and
every
day
solness
no
no
i
suppose
you
are
right
there
and
aline
too
but
impossible
to
make
any
change
herdal
could
you
not
engage
a
clerk
solness
the
first
man
that
came
to
hand
no
thank
you
that
would
never
do
for
me
herdal
but
now
if
your
wife
suppose
with
her
delicate
health
all
this
tries
her
too
much
solness
even
then
i
might
almost
say
it
can
make
no
difference
i
must
keep
kaia
fosli
no
one
else
could
fill
her
place
herdal
no
one
else
solness
curtly
no
no
one
herdal
drawing
his
chair
closer
now
listen
to
me
my
dear
solness
may
i
ask
you
a
question
quite
between
ourselves
solness
by
all
means
herdal
women
you
see
in
certain
matters
they
have
a
deucedly
keen
intuition
solness
they
have
indeed
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
of
that
but
herdal
well
tell
me
now
if
your
wife
ca
endure
this
kaia
fosli
solness
well
what
then
herdal
may
she
not
have
just
just
the
least
little
bit
of
reason
for
this
instinctive
dislike
solness
looks
at
him
and
rises
oho
herdal
now
do
be
offended
but
has
she
solness
with
curt
decision
no
herdal
no
reason
of
any
sort
solness
no
other
than
her
own
suspicious
nature
herdal
i
know
you
have
known
a
good
many
women
in
your
time
solness
yes
i
have
herdal
and
have
been
a
good
deal
taken
with
some
of
them
too
solness
oh
yes
i
do
deny
it
herdal
but
as
regards
miss
fosli
then
there
is
nothing
of
that
sort
in
this
case
solness
no
nothing
at
all
on
my
side
herdal
but
on
her
side
solness
i
do
think
you
have
any
right
to
ask
that
question
doctor
herdal
well
you
know
we
were
discussing
your
wife
intuition
solness
so
we
were
and
for
that
matter
lowers
his
voice
aline
intuition
as
you
call
it
in
a
certain
sense
it
has
not
been
so
far
astray
herdal
aha
there
we
have
it
solness
sits
down
doctor
herdal
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
strange
story
if
you
care
to
listen
to
it
herdal
i
like
listening
to
strange
stories
solness
very
well
then
i
daresay
you
recollect
that
i
took
knut
brovik
and
his
son
into
my
employment
after
the
old
man
business
had
gone
to
the
dogs
herdal
yes
so
i
have
understood
solness
you
see
they
really
are
clever
fellows
these
two
each
of
them
has
talent
in
his
own
way
but
then
the
son
took
it
into
his
head
to
get
engaged
and
the
next
thing
of
course
was
that
he
wanted
to
get
married
and
begin
to
build
on
his
own
account
that
is
the
way
with
all
these
young
people
herdal
laughing
yes
they
have
a
bad
habit
of
wanting
to
marry
solness
just
so
but
of
course
that
did
not
suit
my
plans
for
i
needed
ragnar
myself
and
the
old
man
too
he
is
exceedingly
good
at
calculating
bearing
strains
and
cubic
contents
and
all
that
sort
of
devilry
you
know
herdal
oh
yes
no
doubt
that
indispensable
solness
yes
it
is
but
ragnar
was
absolutely
bent
on
setting
to
work
for
himself
he
would
hear
of
nothing
else
herdal
but
he
has
stayed
with
you
all
the
same
solness
yes
i
tell
you
how
that
came
about
one
day
this
girl
kaia
fosli
came
to
see
them
on
some
errand
or
other
she
had
never
been
here
before
and
when
i
saw
how
utterly
infatuated
they
were
with
each
other
the
thought
occurred
to
me
if
i
cold
only
get
her
into
the
office
here
then
perhaps
ragnar
too
would
stay
where
he
is
herdal
that
was
not
at
all
a
bad
idea
solness
yes
but
at
the
time
i
did
not
breathe
a
word
of
what
was
in
my
mind
i
merely
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
kept
on
wishing
intently
that
i
could
have
her
here
then
i
talked
to
her
a
little
in
a
friendly
way
about
one
thing
and
another
and
then
she
went
away
herdal
well
solness
well
then
next
day
pretty
late
in
the
evening
when
old
brovik
and
ragnar
had
gone
home
she
came
here
again
and
behaved
as
if
i
had
made
an
arrangement
with
her
herdal
an
arrangement
what
about
solness
about
the
very
thing
my
mind
had
been
fixed
on
but
i
had
said
one
single
word
about
it
herdal
that
was
most
extraordinary
solness
yes
was
it
not
and
now
she
wanted
to
know
what
she
was
to
do
here
whether
she
could
begin
the
very
next
morning
and
so
forth
herdal
do
you
think
she
did
it
in
order
to
be
with
her
sweetheart
solness
that
was
what
occurred
to
me
at
first
but
no
that
was
not
it
she
seemed
to
drift
quite
away
from
him
when
once
she
had
come
here
to
me
herdal
she
drifted
over
to
you
then
solness
yes
entirely
if
i
happen
to
look
at
her
when
her
back
is
turned
i
can
tell
that
she
feels
it
she
quivers
and
trembles
the
moment
i
come
near
her
what
do
you
think
of
that
herdal
h
that
not
very
hard
to
explain
solness
well
but
what
about
the
other
thing
that
she
believed
i
had
said
to
her
what
i
had
only
wished
and
willed
silently
inwardly
to
myself
what
do
you
say
to
that
can
you
explain
that
herdal
herdal
no
i
wo
undertake
to
do
that
solness
i
felt
sure
you
would
not
and
so
i
have
never
cared
to
talk
about
it
till
but
it
a
cursed
nuisance
to
me
in
the
long
run
you
understand
here
have
i
got
to
go
on
day
after
day
pretending
and
it
a
shame
to
treat
her
so
too
poor
girl
vehemently
but
i
can
not
do
anything
else
for
if
she
runs
away
from
me
then
ragnar
will
be
off
too
herdal
and
you
have
not
told
your
wife
the
rights
of
the
story
solness
no
herdal
the
why
on
earth
do
you
solness
looks
fixedly
at
him
and
says
in
a
low
voice
because
i
seem
to
find
a
sort
of
of
salutary
in
allowing
aline
to
do
me
an
injustice
herdal
shakes
his
head
i
do
in
the
least
understand
what
you
mean
solness
well
you
see
it
is
like
paying
off
a
little
bit
of
a
huge
immeasurable
debt
herdal
to
your
wife
solness
yes
and
that
always
helps
to
relieve
one
mind
a
little
one
can
breathe
more
freely
for
a
while
you
understand
herdal
no
goodness
knows
i
do
understand
at
all
solness
breaking
off
rises
again
well
well
well
then
we
wo
talk
any
more
about
it
he
saunters
across
the
room
returns
and
stops
beside
the
table
looks
at
the
doctor
with
a
sly
smile
i
suppose
you
think
you
have
drawn
me
out
nicely
now
doctor
herdal
with
some
irritation
drawn
you
out
again
i
have
not
the
faintest
notion
of
what
you
mean
solness
solness
oh
come
out
with
it
i
have
seen
it
quite
clearly
you
know
herdal
what
have
you
seen
solness
in
a
low
voice
slowly
that
you
have
been
quietly
keeping
an
eye
upon
me
herdal
that
have
and
why
in
all
the
world
should
i
do
that
solness
because
you
think
that
i
passionately
well
devil
take
it
you
think
the
same
of
me
as
aline
does
herdal
and
what
does
she
think
about
you
solness
having
recovered
his
she
has
begun
to
think
that
i
am
that
i
am
herdal
ill
you
she
has
never
hinted
such
a
thing
to
me
why
what
can
she
think
is
the
matter
with
you
solness
leans
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
whispers
aline
has
made
up
her
mind
that
i
am
mad
that
is
what
she
thinks
herdal
rising
why
my
dear
fellow
solness
yes
on
my
soul
she
does
i
tell
you
it
is
so
and
she
has
got
you
to
think
the
same
oh
i
can
assure
you
doctor
i
see
it
in
your
face
as
clearly
as
possible
you
do
take
me
in
so
easily
i
can
tell
you
herdal
looks
at
him
in
amazement
never
solness
never
has
such
a
thought
entered
my
mind
solness
with
and
incredulous
smile
really
has
it
not
herdal
no
never
nor
your
wife
mind
either
i
am
convinced
i
could
almost
swear
to
that
solness
well
i
would
advise
you
to
for
in
a
certain
sense
you
see
perhaps
perhaps
she
is
not
so
far
wrong
in
thinking
something
of
the
kind
herdal
come
now
i
really
must
say
solness
interrupting
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
well
well
my
dear
doctor
do
let
us
discuss
this
any
further
we
had
better
agree
to
differ
changes
to
a
tone
of
quiet
amusement
but
look
here
now
doctor
h
herdal
well
solness
since
you
do
believe
that
i
am
ill
and
crazy
and
mad
and
so
forth
herdal
what
then
solness
then
i
daresay
you
fancy
that
i
am
an
extremely
happy
man
herdal
is
that
mere
fancy
solness
laughs
no
no
of
course
not
heaven
forbid
only
think
to
be
solness
the
master
builder
halvard
solness
what
could
be
more
delightful
herdal
yes
i
must
say
it
seems
to
me
you
have
had
the
luck
on
your
side
to
an
astounding
degree
solness
suppresses
a
gloomy
smile
so
i
have
i
ca
complain
on
that
score
herdal
first
of
all
that
grim
old
robbers
castle
was
burnt
down
for
you
and
that
was
certainly
a
great
piece
of
luck
solness
seriously
it
was
the
home
of
aline
family
remember
that
herdal
yes
it
must
have
been
a
great
grief
to
her
solness
she
has
not
got
over
it
to
this
day
not
in
all
these
twelve
or
thirteen
years
herdal
but
you
yourself
you
rose
upon
the
ruins
you
began
as
a
poor
boy
from
a
country
village
and
now
you
are
at
the
head
of
your
profession
ah
yes
solness
you
have
undoubtedly
had
the
luck
on
your
side
solness
looking
at
him
with
embarrassment
yes
but
that
is
just
what
makes
me
so
horribly
afraid
herdal
afraid
because
you
have
the
luck
on
your
side
solness
it
terrifies
me
terrifies
me
every
hour
of
the
day
for
sooner
or
later
the
luck
must
turn
you
see
herdal
oh
nonsense
what
should
make
the
luck
turn
solness
with
firm
assurance
the
younger
generation
herdal
pooh
the
younger
generation
you
are
not
laid
on
the
shelf
yet
i
should
hope
oh
no
your
position
here
is
probably
firmer
now
than
it
has
ever
been
solness
the
luck
will
turn
i
know
it
i
feel
the
day
approaching
some
one
or
other
will
take
it
into
his
head
to
say
give
me
a
chance
and
then
all
the
rest
will
come
clamouring
after
him
and
shake
their
fists
at
me
and
shout
make
room
make
room
yes
just
you
see
doctor
presently
the
younger
generation
will
come
knocking
at
my
door
herdal
laughing
well
and
what
if
they
do
solness
what
if
they
do
then
there
an
end
of
halvard
solness
there
is
a
knock
at
the
door
on
the
left
solness
starts
what
that
did
you
not
hear
something
herdal
some
one
is
knocking
at
the
door
solness
loudly
come
in
hilda
wangel
enters
by
the
hall
door
she
is
of
middle
height
supple
and
delicately
built
somewhat
sunburnt
dressed
in
a
tourist
costume
with
skirt
caught
up
for
walking
a
collar
open
at
the
throat
and
a
small
sailor
hat
on
her
head
knapsack
on
back
plaid
in
strap
and
alpenstock
hilda
goes
straight
up
to
solness
her
eyes
sparkling
with
happiness
good
evening
solness
looks
doubtfully
at
her
good
evening
hilda
laughs
i
almost
believe
you
do
recognise
me
solness
no
i
must
admit
that
just
for
the
moment
herdal
approaching
but
recognise
you
my
dear
young
lady
hilda
pleased
oh
is
it
you
that
herdal
of
course
it
is
to
solness
we
met
at
one
of
the
mountain
stations
this
summer
to
hilda
what
became
of
the
other
ladies
hilda
oh
they
went
westward
herdal
they
did
much
like
all
the
fun
we
used
to
have
in
the
evenings
hilda
no
i
believe
they
did
herdal
holds
up
his
finger
at
her
and
i
am
afraid
it
ca
be
denied
that
you
flirted
a
little
with
us
hilda
well
that
was
better
fun
than
to
sit
there
knitting
stockings
with
all
those
old
women
herdal
laughs
there
i
entirely
agree
with
you
solness
have
you
come
to
town
this
evening
hilda
yes
i
have
just
arrived
herdal
quite
alone
miss
wangel
hilda
oh
yes
solness
wangel
is
your
name
wangel
hilda
looks
in
amused
surprise
at
him
yes
of
course
it
is
solness
then
you
must
be
a
daughter
of
the
district
doctor
up
at
lysanger
hilda
as
before
yes
who
else
daughter
should
i
be
solness
oh
then
i
suppose
we
met
up
there
that
summer
when
i
was
building
a
tower
on
the
old
church
hilda
more
seriously
yes
of
course
it
was
then
we
met
solness
well
that
is
a
long
time
ago
hilda
looks
hard
at
him
it
is
exactly
ten
years
solness
you
must
have
been
a
mere
child
then
i
should
think
hilda
carelessly
well
i
was
twelve
or
thirteen
herdal
is
this
the
first
time
you
have
ever
been
up
to
town
miss
wangel
hilda
yes
it
is
indeed
solness
and
do
you
know
any
one
here
hilda
nobody
but
you
and
of
course
your
wife
solness
so
you
know
her
too
hilda
only
a
little
we
spent
a
few
days
together
at
the
sanatorium
solness
ah
up
there
hilda
she
said
i
might
come
and
pay
her
a
visit
if
ever
i
came
up
to
town
smiles
not
that
that
was
necessary
solness
odd
that
she
should
never
have
mentioned
it
hilda
puts
her
stick
down
by
the
stove
takes
off
the
knapsack
and
lays
it
and
the
plaid
on
the
sofa
herdal
offers
to
help
her
solness
stands
and
gazes
at
her
hilda
going
towards
him
well
now
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
stay
the
night
here
solness
i
am
sure
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
that
hilda
for
i
have
no
other
clothes
than
those
i
stand
in
except
a
change
of
linen
in
my
knapsack
and
that
has
to
go
to
the
wash
for
it
very
dirty
solness
oh
yes
that
can
be
managed
now
i
just
let
my
wife
know
herdal
meanwhile
i
will
go
and
see
my
patient
solness
yes
do
and
come
again
later
on
herdal
playfully
with
a
glance
at
hilda
oh
that
i
will
you
may
be
very
certain
laughs
so
your
prediction
has
come
true
solness
solness
how
so
herdal
the
younger
generation
did
come
knocking
at
your
door
solness
cheerfully
yes
but
in
a
very
different
way
from
what
i
meant
herdal
very
different
yes
that
undeniable
he
goes
out
by
the
solness
opens
the
door
on
the
right
and
speaks
into
the
side
room
solness
aline
will
you
come
in
here
please
here
is
a
friend
of
yours
miss
wangel
solness
appears
in
the
doorway
who
do
you
say
it
is
sees
oh
is
it
you
miss
wangel
solness
miss
wangel
has
this
moment
arrived
and
she
would
like
to
stay
the
night
here
solness
here
with
us
oh
yes
certainly
solness
till
she
can
get
her
things
a
little
in
order
you
know
solness
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
it
no
more
than
my
duty
i
suppose
your
trunk
is
coming
on
later
hilda
i
have
no
trunk
solness
well
it
will
be
all
right
i
daresay
in
the
meantime
you
must
excuse
my
leaving
you
here
with
my
husband
until
i
can
get
a
room
made
a
little
more
comfortable
for
you
solness
can
we
not
give
her
one
of
the
nurseries
they
are
all
ready
as
it
is
solness
oh
yes
there
we
have
room
and
to
spare
to
hilda
sit
down
now
and
rest
a
little
she
goes
out
to
the
right
hilda
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
strolls
about
the
room
and
looks
at
various
objects
solness
stands
in
front
beside
the
table
also
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
follows
her
with
his
eyes
hilda
stops
and
looks
at
him
have
you
several
nurseries
solness
there
are
three
nurseries
in
the
house
hilda
that
a
lot
then
i
suppose
you
have
a
great
many
children
solness
no
we
have
no
child
but
now
you
can
be
the
child
here
for
the
time
being
hilda
for
yes
i
shall
not
cry
i
mean
to
sleep
as
sound
as
a
stone
solness
yes
you
must
be
very
tired
i
should
think
hilda
oh
no
but
all
the
same
it
so
delicious
to
lie
and
dream
solness
do
you
dream
much
of
nights
hilda
oh
yes
almost
always
solness
what
do
you
dream
about
most
hilda
i
tell
you
another
time
perhaps
she
again
strolls
about
the
room
stops
at
the
desk
and
turns
over
the
books
and
papers
a
little
solness
approaching
are
you
searching
for
anything
hilda
no
i
am
merely
looking
at
all
these
things
turns
perhaps
i
must
solness
oh
by
all
means
hilda
is
it
you
that
writes
in
this
great
ledger
solness
no
it
my
hilda
is
it
a
woman
solness
smiles
yes
hilda
one
you
employ
here
in
your
office
solness
yes
hilda
is
she
married
solness
no
she
is
single
hilda
oh
indeed
solness
but
i
believe
she
is
soon
going
to
be
married
hilda
that
a
good
thing
for
her
solness
but
not
such
a
good
thing
for
me
for
then
i
shall
have
nobody
to
help
me
hilda
ca
you
get
hold
of
some
one
else
who
will
do
just
as
well
solness
perhaps
you
would
stay
here
and
and
write
in
the
ledger
hilda
measures
him
with
a
glance
yes
i
daresay
no
thank
you
nothing
of
that
sort
for
me
she
again
strolls
across
the
room
and
sits
down
on
the
solness
too
goes
to
the
table
hilda
continuing
for
there
must
surely
be
plenty
of
other
thing
to
be
done
here
looks
smilingly
at
him
do
you
think
so
too
solness
of
course
first
of
all
i
suppose
you
want
to
make
a
round
of
the
shops
and
get
yourself
up
in
the
height
of
fashion
hilda
amused
no
i
think
i
shall
let
that
alone
solness
indeed
hilda
for
you
must
know
i
have
run
through
all
my
money
solness
laughs
neither
trunk
nor
money
then
hilda
neither
one
nor
the
other
but
never
mind
it
does
matter
now
solness
come
now
i
like
you
for
that
hilda
only
for
that
solness
for
that
among
other
things
sits
in
the
is
your
father
alive
still
hilda
yes
father
alive
solness
perhaps
you
are
thinking
of
studying
here
hilda
no
that
had
occurred
to
me
solness
but
i
suppose
you
will
be
staying
for
some
time
hilda
that
must
depend
upon
circumstances
she
sits
awhile
rocking
herself
and
looking
at
him
half
seriously
half
with
a
suppressed
smile
then
she
takes
off
her
hat
and
puts
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
hilda
solness
solness
well
hilda
have
you
a
very
bad
memory
solness
a
bad
memory
no
not
that
i
am
aware
of
hilda
then
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
about
what
happened
up
there
solness
in
momentary
surprise
up
at
lysanger
indifferently
why
it
was
nothing
much
to
talk
about
it
seems
to
me
hilda
looks
reproachfully
at
him
how
can
you
sit
there
and
say
such
things
solness
well
then
you
talk
to
me
about
it
hilda
when
the
tower
was
finished
we
had
grand
doings
in
the
town
solness
yes
i
shall
not
easily
forget
that
day
hilda
smiles
will
you
not
that
comes
well
from
you
solness
comes
well
hilda
there
was
music
in
the
churchyard
and
many
many
hundreds
of
people
we
were
dressed
in
white
and
we
all
carried
flags
solness
ah
yes
those
flags
i
can
tell
you
i
remember
them
hilda
then
you
climbed
right
up
the
scaffolding
straight
to
the
very
top
and
you
had
a
great
wreath
with
you
and
you
hung
that
wreath
right
away
up
on
the
solness
curtly
interrupting
i
always
did
that
in
those
days
it
is
an
old
custom
hilda
it
was
so
wonderfully
thrilling
to
stand
below
and
look
up
at
you
fancy
if
he
should
fall
over
he
the
master
builder
himself
solness
as
if
to
divert
her
from
the
subject
yes
yes
yes
that
might
very
will
have
happened
too
for
one
of
those
little
devils
she
went
on
in
such
a
way
and
screamed
up
at
me
so
hilda
sparkling
with
pleasure
hurrah
for
master
builder
solness
yes
solness
and
waved
and
flourished
with
her
flag
so
that
i
so
that
it
almost
made
me
giddy
to
look
at
it
hilda
in
a
lower
voice
seriously
that
little
devil
that
was
solness
fixes
his
eyes
steadily
upon
her
i
am
sure
of
that
now
it
must
have
been
you
hilda
lively
again
oh
it
was
so
gloriously
thrilling
i
could
not
have
believed
there
was
a
builder
in
the
whole
world
that
could
build
such
a
tremendously
high
tower
and
then
that
you
yourself
should
stand
at
the
very
top
of
it
as
large
as
life
and
that
you
should
not
be
the
least
bit
dizzy
it
was
that
above
everything
that
made
one
made
one
dizzy
to
think
of
solness
how
could
you
be
so
certain
that
i
was
not
hilda
scouting
the
idea
no
indeed
oh
no
i
knew
that
instinctively
for
if
you
had
been
you
could
never
have
stood
up
there
and
sung
solness
looks
at
her
in
astonishment
sung
did
sing
hilda
yes
i
should
think
you
did
solness
shakes
his
head
i
have
never
sung
a
note
in
my
life
hilda
yes
indeed
you
sang
then
it
sounded
like
harps
in
the
air
solness
thoughtfully
this
is
very
strange
all
this
hilda
is
silent
awhile
looks
at
him
and
says
in
a
low
voice
but
then
it
was
after
that
that
the
real
thing
happened
solness
the
real
thing
hilda
sparking
with
vivacity
yes
i
surely
do
need
to
remind
you
of
that
solness
oh
yes
do
remind
me
a
little
of
that
too
hilda
do
you
remember
that
a
great
dinner
was
given
in
your
honour
at
the
club
solness
yes
to
be
sure
it
must
have
been
the
same
afternoon
for
i
left
the
place
next
morning
hilda
and
from
the
club
you
were
invited
to
come
round
to
our
house
to
supper
solness
quite
right
miss
wangel
it
is
wonderful
how
all
these
trifles
have
impressed
themselves
on
your
mind
hilda
trifles
i
like
that
perhaps
it
was
a
trifle
too
that
i
was
alone
in
the
room
when
you
came
in
solness
were
you
alone
hilda
without
answering
him
you
did
call
me
a
little
devil
then
solness
no
i
suppose
i
did
not
hilda
you
said
i
was
lovely
in
my
white
dress
and
that
i
looked
like
a
little
princess
solness
i
have
no
doubt
you
did
miss
and
besides
i
was
feeling
so
buoyant
and
free
that
day
hilda
and
then
you
said
that
when
i
grew
up
i
should
be
your
princess
solness
laughing
a
little
dear
dear
did
i
say
that
too
hilda
yes
you
did
and
when
i
asked
how
long
i
should
have
to
wait
you
said
that
you
would
come
again
in
ten
years
like
a
troll
and
carry
me
off
to
spain
or
some
such
place
and
you
promised
you
would
buy
me
a
kingdom
there
solness
as
before
yes
after
a
good
dinner
one
does
haggle
about
the
halfpence
but
did
i
really
say
all
that
hilda
laughs
to
herself
yes
and
you
told
me
too
what
the
kingdom
was
to
be
called
solness
well
what
was
it
hilda
it
was
to
be
called
the
kingdom
of
orangia
you
said
the
original
appelsinia
appelsin
meaning
orange
solness
well
that
was
an
appetising
name
hilda
no
i
did
like
it
a
bit
for
it
seemed
as
though
you
wanted
to
make
game
of
me
solness
i
am
sure
that
can
not
have
been
my
intention
hilda
no
i
should
hope
not
considering
what
you
did
next
solness
what
in
the
world
did
i
do
next
hilda
well
that
the
finishing
touch
if
you
have
forgotten
that
too
i
should
have
thought
no
one
could
help
remembering
such
a
thing
as
that
solness
yes
yes
just
give
me
a
hint
and
then
perhaps
well
hilda
looks
fixedly
at
him
you
came
and
kissed
me
solness
solness
did
hilda
yes
indeed
you
did
you
took
me
in
both
your
arms
and
bent
my
head
back
and
kissed
me
many
times
solness
now
really
my
dear
miss
wangel
hilda
rises
you
surely
can
not
mean
to
deny
it
solness
yes
i
do
i
deny
it
altogether
hilda
looks
scornfully
at
him
oh
indeed
she
turns
and
goes
slowly
up
to
the
stove
where
she
remains
standing
motionless
her
face
averted
from
him
her
hands
behind
her
back
short
pause
solness
goes
cautiously
up
behind
her
miss
wangel
hilda
is
silent
and
does
not
move
solness
do
stand
there
like
a
statue
you
must
have
dreamt
all
this
lays
his
hand
on
her
arm
now
just
listen
hilda
makes
an
impatient
movement
with
her
arm
solness
as
a
thought
flashes
upon
him
or
wait
a
moment
there
is
something
under
all
this
you
may
depend
hilda
does
not
move
solness
in
a
low
voice
but
with
emphasis
i
must
have
thought
all
that
i
must
have
wished
it
have
willed
it
have
longed
to
do
it
and
then
may
not
that
be
the
explanation
hilda
is
still
silent
solness
impatiently
oh
very
well
deuce
take
it
all
then
i
did
do
it
i
suppose
hilda
turns
her
head
a
little
but
without
looking
at
him
then
you
admit
it
now
solness
yes
whatever
you
like
hilda
you
came
and
put
your
arms
round
me
solness
oh
yes
hilda
and
bent
my
head
back
solness
very
far
back
hilda
and
kissed
me
solness
yes
i
did
hilda
many
times
solness
as
many
as
ever
you
like
hilda
turns
quickly
toward
him
and
has
once
more
the
sparkling
expression
of
gladness
in
her
eyes
well
you
see
i
got
it
out
of
you
at
last
solness
with
a
slight
smile
yes
just
think
of
my
forgetting
such
a
thing
as
that
hilda
again
a
little
sulky
retreats
from
him
oh
you
have
kissed
so
many
people
in
your
time
i
suppose
solness
no
you
must
think
that
of
me
hilda
seats
herself
in
the
solness
stands
and
leans
against
the
looks
observantly
at
her
miss
wangel
hilda
yes
solness
how
was
it
now
what
came
of
all
this
between
us
two
hilda
why
nothing
more
came
of
it
you
know
that
quite
well
for
then
the
other
guests
came
in
and
then
bah
solness
quite
so
the
others
came
in
to
think
of
my
forgetting
that
too
hilda
oh
you
have
really
forgotten
anything
you
are
only
a
little
ashamed
of
it
all
i
am
sure
one
does
forget
things
of
that
kind
solness
no
one
would
suppose
not
hilda
lively
again
looks
at
him
perhaps
you
have
even
forgotten
what
day
it
was
solness
what
day
hilda
yes
on
what
day
did
you
hang
the
wreath
on
the
tower
well
tell
me
at
once
solness
h
i
confess
i
have
forgotten
the
particular
day
i
only
know
it
was
ten
years
ago
some
time
in
autumn
hilda
nods
her
head
slowly
several
times
it
was
ten
years
ago
on
the
of
september
solness
yes
it
must
have
been
about
that
time
fancy
your
remembering
that
too
stops
but
wait
a
moment
yes
it
the
of
september
today
hilda
yes
it
is
and
the
ten
years
are
gone
and
you
did
come
as
you
had
promised
me
solness
promised
you
threatened
i
suppose
you
mean
hilda
i
do
think
there
was
any
sort
of
threat
in
that
solness
well
then
a
little
bit
of
fun
hilda
was
that
all
you
wanted
to
make
fun
of
me
solness
well
or
to
have
a
little
joke
with
you
upon
my
soul
i
recollect
but
it
must
have
been
something
of
that
kind
for
you
were
a
mere
child
then
hilda
oh
perhaps
i
was
quite
such
a
child
either
not
such
a
mere
chit
as
you
imagine
solness
looks
searchingly
at
her
did
you
really
and
seriously
expect
me
to
come
again
hilda
conceals
a
smile
yes
indeed
i
did
expect
that
of
you
solness
that
i
should
come
back
to
your
home
and
take
you
away
with
me
hilda
just
like
a
troll
yes
solness
and
make
a
princess
of
you
hilda
that
what
you
promised
solness
and
give
you
a
kingdom
as
well
hilda
looks
up
at
the
ceiling
why
not
of
course
it
need
not
have
been
an
actual
sort
of
a
kingdom
solness
but
something
else
just
as
good
hilda
yes
at
least
as
good
looks
at
him
a
moment
i
thought
if
you
could
build
the
highest
in
the
world
you
could
surely
manage
to
raise
a
kingdom
of
one
sort
or
another
as
well
solness
shakes
his
head
i
ca
quite
make
you
out
miss
wangel
hilda
can
you
not
to
me
it
seems
all
so
simple
solness
no
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
whether
you
mean
all
you
say
or
are
simply
having
a
joke
with
me
hilda
smiles
making
fun
of
you
perhaps
i
too
solness
yes
exactly
making
fun
of
both
of
us
looks
at
her
is
it
long
since
you
found
out
that
i
was
married
hilda
i
have
know
it
all
along
why
do
you
ask
me
that
solness
lightly
oh
well
it
just
occurred
to
me
looks
earnestly
at
her
and
says
in
a
low
voice
what
have
you
come
for
hilda
i
want
my
kingdom
the
time
is
up
solness
laughs
involuntarily
what
a
girl
you
are
hilda
gaily
out
with
my
kingdom
solness
raps
with
her
fingers
the
kingdom
on
the
table
solness
pushing
the
nearer
and
sitting
down
now
seriously
speaking
what
have
you
come
for
what
do
you
really
want
to
do
here
hilda
oh
first
of
all
i
want
to
go
round
and
look
at
all
the
things
that
you
have
built
solness
that
will
give
you
plenty
of
exercise
hilda
yes
i
know
you
have
built
a
tremendous
lot
solness
i
have
indeed
especially
of
late
years
hilda
many
among
the
rest
immensely
high
ones
solness
no
i
build
no
more
now
nor
churches
either
hilda
what
do
you
build
then
solness
homes
for
human
beings
hilda
reflectively
could
you
build
a
little
a
little
bit
of
a
over
these
homes
as
well
solness
starting
what
do
you
mean
by
that
hilda
i
mean
something
that
points
points
up
into
the
free
air
with
the
vane
at
a
dizzy
height
solness
pondering
a
little
strange
that
you
should
say
that
for
that
is
just
what
i
am
most
anxious
to
do
hilda
impatiently
why
do
you
do
it
then
solness
shakes
his
head
no
the
people
will
not
have
it
hilda
fancy
their
not
wanting
it
solness
more
lightly
but
now
i
am
building
a
new
home
for
myself
just
opposite
here
hilda
for
yourself
solness
yes
it
is
almost
finished
and
on
that
there
is
a
tower
hilda
a
high
tower
solness
yes
hilda
very
high
solness
no
doubt
people
will
say
it
is
too
high
too
high
for
a
hilda
i
go
out
to
look
at
that
tower
first
thing
morning
solness
sits
resting
his
cheek
on
his
hand
and
gazes
at
her
tell
me
miss
wangel
what
is
your
name
your
christian
name
i
mean
hilda
why
hilda
of
course
solness
as
before
hilda
indeed
hilda
do
you
remember
that
you
called
me
hilda
yourself
that
day
when
you
misbehaved
solness
did
i
really
hilda
but
then
you
said
little
hilda
and
i
did
like
that
solness
oh
you
did
like
that
miss
hilda
hilda
no
not
at
such
a
time
as
that
but
princess
hilda
that
will
sound
very
well
i
think
solness
very
well
indeed
princess
hilda
of
of
what
was
to
be
the
name
of
the
kingdom
hilda
pooh
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
that
stupid
kingdom
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
quite
a
different
one
solness
has
leaned
back
in
the
chair
still
gazing
at
her
is
it
strange
the
more
i
think
of
it
now
the
more
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
had
gone
about
all
these
years
torturing
myself
with
h
hilda
with
what
solness
with
the
effort
to
recover
something
some
experience
which
i
seemed
to
have
forgotten
but
i
never
had
the
least
inkling
of
what
it
could
be
hilda
you
should
have
tied
a
knot
in
your
solness
solness
in
that
case
i
should
simply
have
had
to
go
racking
my
brains
to
discover
what
the
knot
could
mean
hilda
oh
yes
i
suppose
there
are
trolls
of
that
kind
in
the
world
too
solness
rises
slowly
what
a
good
thing
it
is
that
you
have
come
to
me
now
hilda
looks
deeply
into
his
eyes
is
it
a
good
thing
solness
for
i
have
been
so
lonely
here
i
have
been
gazing
so
helplessly
at
it
all
in
a
lower
voice
i
must
tell
you
i
have
begun
to
be
afraid
of
the
younger
generation
hilda
with
a
little
snort
of
contempt
pooh
is
the
younger
generation
something
to
be
afraid
of
solness
it
is
indeed
and
that
is
why
i
have
locked
and
barred
myself
in
mysteriously
i
tell
you
the
younger
generation
will
one
day
come
and
thunder
at
my
door
they
will
break
in
upon
me
hilda
then
i
should
say
you
ought
to
go
out
and
open
the
door
to
the
younger
generation
solness
open
the
door
hilda
yes
let
them
come
in
to
you
on
friendly
terms
as
it
were
solness
no
no
no
the
younger
generation
it
means
retribution
you
see
it
comes
as
if
under
a
new
banner
heralding
the
turn
of
fortune
hilda
rises
looks
at
him
and
says
with
a
quivering
twitch
of
her
lips
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
solness
solness
yes
you
can
indeed
for
you
too
come
under
a
new
banner
it
seems
to
me
you
marshalled
against
youth
herdal
comes
in
by
the
herdal
what
you
and
miss
wangel
here
still
solness
yes
we
have
had
no
end
of
things
to
talk
about
hilda
both
old
and
new
herdal
have
you
really
hilda
oh
it
has
been
the
greatest
fun
for
solness
he
has
such
a
miraculous
memory
all
the
least
little
details
he
remembers
instantly
solness
enters
by
the
door
on
the
right
solness
well
miss
wangel
your
room
is
quite
ready
for
you
now

takes

arm
and
goes
out
with
him
to
the
right

meanwhile
been
collecting
her
travelling
things
hilda
softly
and
rapidly
to
solness

it
true

i
be
of
use
to
you
solness
takes
the
things
from
her

the
very
being

have
needed

hilda
looks
at

with
happy
wondering
eyes
and
clasps
her
hands
but
then
great
heavens
solness
eagerly
what
hilda

have
my
kingdom
solness
involuntarily
hilda
hilda
again
with
the
quivering
twitch
of
her
lips
almost
i
was
going
to
say
she
goes
out
to
the
right

prettily
furnished
small

large
mirror
over
it
stands
of
plants
and
flowers
in
front
on
the
left
a
sofa
with
a
table
and
chairs
further
back
a
bookcase
well
forward
in
the
room
before
the
bay
window
a
small
table
and
some
chairs
it
is
early
in
the
day
solness
sits
by
the
little
table
with
ragnar
portfolio
open
in
front
of
him
he
is
turning
the
drawings
over
and
closely
examining
some
of
them
solness
moves
about
noiselessly
with
a
small
attending
to
her
flowers
she
is
dressed
in
black
as
before
her
hat
cloak
and
parasol
lie
on
a
chair
near
the
mirror
unobserved
by
her
solness
now
and
again
follows
her
with
his
eyes
neither
of
them
speaks
kaia
fosli
enters
quietly
by
the
door
on
the
left
solness
turns
his
head
and
says
in
an
tone
of
indifference
well
is
that
you
kaia
i
merely
wished
to
let
you
know
that
i
have
come
solness
yes
yes
that
all
right
has
ragnar
come
too
kaia
no
not
yet
he
had
to
wait
a
little
while
to
see
the
doctor
but
he
is
coming
presently
to
hear
solness
how
is
the
old
man
kaia
not
well
he
begs
you
to
excuse
him
he
is
obliged
to
keep
his
bed
solness
why
of
course
by
all
means
let
him
rest
but
now
get
to
your
work
kaia
yes
pauses
at
the
door
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
ragnar
when
he
comes
solness
no
i
do
know
that
i
have
anything
particular
to
say
to
him
kaia
goes
out
again
to
the
left
solness
remains
seated
turning
over
the
drawings
solness
over
beside
the
plants
i
wonder
if
he
is
going
to
die
now
as
well
solness
looks
up
at
her
as
well
as
who
solness
without
answering
yes
yes
depend
upon
it
halvard
old
brovik
is
going
to
die
too
you
see
that
he
will
solness
my
dear
aline
ought
you
not
to
go
out
for
a
little
walk
solness
yes
i
suppose
i
ought
to
she
continues
to
attend
the
flowers
solness
bending
over
the
drawings
is
she
still
asleep
solness
looking
at
him
is
it
miss
wangel
you
are
sitting
there
thinking
about
solness
indifferently
i
just
happened
to
recollect
her
solness
miss
wangle
was
up
long
ago
solness
oh
was
she
solness
when
i
went
in
to
see
her
she
was
busy
putting
her
things
in
order
she
goes
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
slowly
begins
to
put
on
her
hat
solness
after
a
short
pause
so
we
have
found
a
use
for
one
our
nurseries
after
all
aline
solness
yes
we
have
solness
that
seems
to
me
better
than
to
have
them
all
standing
empty
solness
that
emptiness
is
dreadful
you
are
right
there
solness
closes
the
portfolio
rises
and
approaches
her
you
will
find
that
we
shall
get
on
far
better
after
this
aline
things
will
be
more
comfortable
life
will
be
easier
especially
for
you
solness
looks
at
him
after
this
solness
yes
believe
me
aline
solness
do
you
mean
because
she
has
come
here
solness
checking
himself
i
mean
of
course
when
once
we
have
moved
into
the
new
home
solness
takes
her
cloak
ah
do
you
think
so
halvard
will
it
be
better
then
solness
i
ca
think
otherwise
and
surely
you
think
so
too
solness
i
think
nothing
at
all
about
the
new
house
solness
cast
down
it
hard
for
me
to
hear
you
say
that
for
you
know
it
is
mainly
for
your
sake
that
i
have
built
it
he
offers
to
help
her
on
with
her
cloak
solness
evades
him
the
fact
is
you
do
far
too
much
for
my
sake
solness
with
a
certain
vehemence
no
no
you
really
must
say
that
aline
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
you
say
such
things
solness
very
well
then
i
wo
say
it
halvard
solness
but
i
stick
to
what
said
you
see
that
things
will
be
easier
for
you
in
the
new
place
solness
oh
heavens
easier
for
me
solness
eagerly
yes
indeed
they
will
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
that
for
you
see
there
will
be
so
very
very
much
there
that
will
remind
you
of
your
own
home
solness
the
home
that
used
to
be
father
and
mother
and
that
was
burnt
to
the
ground
solness
in
a
low
voice
yes
yes
my
poor
aline
that
was
a
terrible
blow
for
you
solness
breaking
out
in
lamentation
you
may
build
as
much
as
ever
you
like
halvard
you
can
never
build
up
again
a
real
home
for
me
solness
crosses
the
room
well
in
heaven
name
let
us
talk
no
more
about
it
then
solness
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
talking
about
it
for
you
always
put
the
thought
away
from
you
solness
stops
suddenly
and
looks
at
her
do
i
and
why
should
i
do
that
put
the
thought
away
from
me
solness
oh
yes
halvard
i
understand
you
very
well
you
are
so
anxious
to
spare
me
and
to
find
excuses
for
me
too
as
much
as
ever
you
can
solness
with
astonishment
in
his
eyes
you
is
it
you
yourself
that
your
are
talking
about
aline
solness
yes
who
else
should
it
be
but
myself
solness
involuntarily
to
himself
that
too
solness
as
for
the
old
house
i
would
mind
so
much
about
that
when
once
misfortune
was
in
the
air
why
solness
ah
you
are
right
there
misfortune
will
have
its
way
as
the
saying
goes
solness
but
it
what
came
of
the
fire
the
dreadful
thing
that
followed
that
is
the
thing
that
that
that
solness
vehemently
do
think
about
that
aline
solness
ah
that
is
exactly
what
i
can
not
help
thinking
about
and
now
at
last
i
must
speak
about
it
too
for
i
do
seem
to
be
able
to
bear
it
any
longer
and
then
never
to
be
able
to
forgive
myself
solness
exclaiming
yourself
solness
yes
for
i
had
duties
on
both
sides
both
towards
you
and
towards
the
little
ones
i
ought
to
have
hardened
myself
not
to
have
let
the
horror
take
such
hold
upon
me
nor
the
grief
for
the
burning
of
my
home
wrings
her
hands
oh
halvard
if
i
had
only
had
the
strength
solness
softly
much
moved
comes
closer
aline
you
must
promise
me
never
to
think
these
thoughts
any
promise
me
that
dear
solness
oh
promise
promise
one
can
promise
anything
solness
clenches
his
hands
and
crosses
the
room
oh
but
this
is
hopeless
hopeless
never
a
ray
of
sunlight
not
so
much
as
a
gleam
of
brightness
to
light
up
our
home
solness
this
is
no
home
halvard
solness
oh
no
you
may
well
say
that
gloomily
and
god
knows
whether
you
are
not
right
in
saying
that
it
will
be
no
better
for
us
in
the
new
house
either
solness
it
will
never
be
any
better
just
as
empty
just
as
desolate
there
as
here
solness
vehemently
why
in
all
the
world
have
we
built
it
then
can
you
tell
me
that
solness
no
you
must
answer
that
question
for
yourself
solness
glances
suspiciously
at
her
what
do
you
mean
by
that
aline
solness
what
do
i
mean
solness
yes
in
the
devil
name
you
said
it
so
strangely
as
if
you
had
some
hidden
meaning
in
it
solness
no
indeed
i
assure
you
solness
comes
closer
oh
come
now
i
know
what
i
know
i
have
both
my
eyes
and
my
ears
about
me
aline
you
may
depend
upon
that
solness
why
what
are
you
talking
about
what
is
it
solness
places
himself
in
front
of
her
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
find
a
kind
of
lurking
hidden
meaning
in
the
most
innocent
word
i
happen
to
say
solness
do
you
say
do
that
solness
laughs
it
natural
enough
aline
when
you
have
a
sick
man
on
your
hands
solness
anxiously
sick
are
you
ill
halvard
solness
violently
a
man
then
a
crazy
man
call
me
what
you
will
solness
feels
blindly
for
a
chair
and
sits
down
halvard
for
god
sake
solness
but
you
are
wrong
both
you
and
the
doctor
i
am
not
in
the
state
that
you
imagine
he
walks
up
and
down
the
room
solness
follows
him
anxiously
with
her
eyes
finally
he
goes
up
to
her
solness
calmly
in
reality
there
is
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
me
solness
no
there
is
is
there
but
then
what
is
it
that
troubles
you
so
solness
why
this
that
i
often
feel
ready
to
sink
under
this
terrible
burden
of
debt
solness
debt
do
you
say
but
you
owe
no
one
anything
halvard
solness
softly
with
emotion
i
owe
a
boundless
debt
to
you
to
you
to
you
aline
solness
rises
slowly
what
is
behind
all
this
you
may
just
as
well
tell
me
at
once
solness
but
there
is
nothing
behind
it
i
have
never
done
you
any
wrong
not
wittingly
and
willfully
at
any
rate
and
yet
and
yet
it
seems
as
though
a
crushing
debt
rested
upon
me
and
weighed
me
down
solness
a
debt
to
me
solness
chiefly
to
you
solness
then
you
are
ill
after
all
halvard
solness
gloomily
i
suppose
i
must
be
or
not
far
from
it
looks
towards
the
door
to
the
right
which
is
opened
at
this
moment
ah
now
it
grows
light
hilda
wangel
comes
in
she
has
made
some
alteration
in
her
dress
and
let
down
her
skirt
hilda
good
morning
solness
solness
nods
slept
well
hilda
quite
deliciously
like
a
child
in
a
cradle
oh
i
lay
and
stretched
myself
like
like
a
princess
solness
smiles
a
little
you
were
thoroughly
comfortable
then
hilda
i
should
think
so
solness
and
no
doubt
you
dreamed
too
hilda
yes
i
did
but
that
was
horrid
solness
was
it
hilda
yes
for
i
dreamed
i
was
falling
over
a
frightfully
high
sheer
precipice
do
you
never
have
that
kind
of
dream
solness
oh
yes
now
and
then
hilda
it
tremendously
thrilling
when
you
fall
and
fall
solness
it
seems
to
make
one
blood
run
cold
hilda
do
you
draw
your
legs
up
under
you
while
you
are
falling
solness
yes
as
high
as
ever
i
can
hilda
so
do
solness
takes
her
parasol
i
must
go
into
town
now
halvard
to
hilda
and
i
try
to
get
one
or
two
things
that
you
may
require
hilda
making
a
motion
to
throw
her
arms
round
her
neck
oh
you
dear
solness
you
are
really
much
too
kind
to
me
frightfully
kind
solness
deprecatingly
freeing
herself
oh
not
at
all
it
only
my
duty
so
i
am
very
glad
to
do
it
hilda
offended
pouts
but
really
i
think
i
am
quite
fit
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
now
that
i
put
my
dress
to
rights
or
do
you
think
i
am
not
solness
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
people
would
stare
at
you
a
little
hilda
contemptuously
pooh
is
that
all
that
only
amuses
me
solness
with
suppressed
yes
but
people
might
take
it
into
their
heads
that
you
were
mad
too
you
see
hilda
mad
are
there
so
many
mad
people
here
in
town
then
solness
points
to
his
own
forehead
here
you
see
one
at
all
events
hilda
you
solness
solness
have
you
not
noticed
that
yet
hilda
no
i
certainly
have
not
reflects
and
laughs
a
little
and
yet
perhaps
in
one
single
thing
solness
ah
do
you
hear
that
aline
solness
what
is
that
one
single
thing
miss
wangel
hilda
no
i
wo
say
solness
oh
yes
do
hilda
no
thank
you
i
am
not
so
mad
as
that
solness
when
you
and
miss
wangel
are
alone
i
daresay
she
will
tell
you
halvard
solness
ah
you
think
she
will
solness
oh
yes
certainly
for
you
have
known
her
so
well
in
the
past
ever
since
she
was
a
child
you
tell
me
she
goes
out
by
the
door
on
the
left
hilda
after
a
little
while
does
your
wife
dislike
me
very
much
solness
did
you
think
you
noticed
anything
of
the
kind
hilda
did
you
notice
it
yourself
solness
evasively
aline
has
become
exceedingly
shy
with
strangers
of
late
years
hilda
has
she
really
solness
but
if
only
you
could
get
to
know
her
thoroughly
ah
she
is
so
good
so
kind
so
excellent
a
creature
hilda
impatiently
but
if
she
is
all
that
what
made
her
say
that
about
her
duty
solness
her
duty
hilda
she
said
that
she
would
go
out
and
buy
something
for
me
because
it
was
her
duty
oh
i
ca
bear
that
ugly
horrid
word
solness
why
not
hilda
it
sounds
so
could
and
sharp
and
stinging
duty
duty
duty
do
you
think
so
too
does
it
seem
to
sting
you
solness
h
have
thought
much
about
it
hilda
yes
it
does
and
if
she
is
so
good
as
you
say
she
is
why
should
she
talk
in
that
way
solness
but
good
lord
what
would
you
have
had
her
say
then
hilda
she
might
have
said
she
would
do
it
because
she
had
taken
a
tremendous
fancy
to
me
she
might
have
said
something
like
that
something
really
warm
and
cordial
you
understand
solness
looks
at
her
is
that
how
you
would
like
to
have
it
hilda
yes
precisely
she
wanders
about
the
room
stops
at
the
bookcase
and
looks
at
the
books
what
a
lot
of
books
you
have
solness
yes
i
have
got
together
a
good
many
hilda
do
you
read
them
all
too
solness
i
used
to
try
to
do
you
read
much
hilda
no
never
i
have
given
it
up
for
it
all
seems
so
irrelevant
solness
that
is
just
my
feeling
hilda
wanders
about
a
little
stops
at
the
small
table
opens
the
portfolio
and
turns
over
the
contents
hilda
are
all
these
your
drawings
yours
solness
no
they
are
drawn
by
a
young
man
whom
i
employ
to
help
me
hilda
some
one
you
have
taught
solness
oh
yes
no
doubt
he
has
learnt
something
from
me
too
hilda
sits
down
then
i
suppose
he
is
very
clever
looks
at
a
drawing
is
he
solness
oh
he
might
be
worse
for
my
purpose
hilda
oh
yes
i
sure
he
is
frightfully
clever
solness
do
you
think
you
can
see
that
in
the
drawings
hilda
pooh
these
scrawlings
but
if
he
has
been
learning
from
you
solness
oh
so
far
as
that
goes
there
are
plenty
of
people
here
that
have
learnt
from
me
and
have
come
to
little
enough
for
all
that
hilda
looks
at
him
and
shakes
her
head
no
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
understand
how
you
can
be
so
stupid
solness
stupid
do
you
think
i
am
so
very
stupid
hilda
yes
i
do
indeed
if
you
are
content
to
go
about
here
teaching
all
these
people
solness
with
a
slight
start
well
and
why
not
hilda
rises
half
serious
half
laughing
no
indeed
solness
what
can
be
the
good
of
that
no
one
but
you
should
be
allowed
to
build
you
should
stand
quite
alone
do
it
all
yourself
now
you
know
it
solness
involuntarily
hilda
hilda
well
solness
how
in
the
world
did
that
come
into
your
head
hilda
do
you
think
i
am
so
very
far
wrong
then
solness
no
that
not
what
i
mean
but
now
i
tell
you
something
hilda
well
solness
i
keep
on
incessantly
in
silence
and
alone
brooding
on
that
very
thought
hilda
yes
that
seems
to
me
perfectly
natural
solness
looks
somewhat
searchingly
at
her
perhaps
you
have
noticed
it
already
hilda
no
indeed
i
have
solness
but
just
now
when
you
said
you
thought
i
was
off
my
balance
in
one
thing
you
said
hilda
oh
i
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
solness
what

garden

right
above

great
quarry

new
house

mean
solness

one
that

being
built

have
a
very
high
tower
solness
the
scaffolding
is
still
up
hilda

that
your
new
house

house

that
house

as
there

child

and
there
never
will
be
one
hilda
with
a
well
is
it
just
as
i
said
solness
that
hilda
that
you
are
a
little
a
little
mad
after
all
solness
was
that
what
you
were
thinking
of
hilda
yes
of
all
the
empty
nurseries
i
slept
in
solness
lowers
his
voice
we
have
had
children
aline
and
hilda
looks
eagerly
at
him
have
you
solness
two
little
boys
they
were
of
the
same
age
hilda
twins
then
solness
yes
twins
it
eleven
or
twelve
years
ago
now
hilda
cautiously
and
so
both
of
them
you
have
lost
both
the
twins
then
solness
with
quiet
emotion
we
kept
them
only
about
three
weeks
or
scarcely
so
much
bursts
forth
oh
hilda
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
good
thing
it
is
for
me
that
you
have
come
for
now
at
last
i
have
some
one
to
talk
to
hilda
can
you
not
talk
to
her
too
solness
not
about
this
not
as
i
want
to
talk
and
must
talk
gloomily
and
not
about
so
many
other
things
either
hilda
in
a
subdued
voice
was
that
all
you
meant
when
you
said
you
need
me
solness
that
was
mainly
what
i
meant
at
all
events
yesterday
for
i
am
not
so
sure
breaking
off
come
here
and
let
us
sit
down
hilda
sit
there
on
the
sofa
so
that
you
can
look
into
the
garden
hilda
seats
herself
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
solness
brings
a
chair
closer
should
you
like
to
hear
about
it
hilda
yes
i
shall
love
to
sit
and
listen
to
you
solness
sits
down
then
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
hilda
now
i
can
see
both
the
garden
and
you
solness
so
now
tell
away
begin
solness
points
towards
the
out
there
on
the
rising
ground
where
you
see
the
new
house
hilda
yes
solness
aline
and
i
lived
there
in
the
first
years
of
our
married
life
there
was
an
old
house
up
there
that
had
belonged
to
her
mother
and
we
inherited
it
and
the
whole
of
the
great
garden
with
it
hilda
was
there
a
tower
on
that
house
too
solness
no
nothing
of
the
kind
from
the
outside
it
looked
like
a
great
dark
ugly
wooden
box
but
all
the
same
it
was
snug
and
comfortable
enough
inside
hilda
then
did
you
pull
down
the
ramshackle
old
place
solness
no
it
was
burnt
down
hilda
the
whole
of
it
solness
yes
hilda
was
that
a
great
misfortune
for
you
solness
that
depends
on
how
you
look
at
it
as
a
builder
the
fire
was
the
making
of
me
hilda
well
but
solness
it
was
just
after
the
birth
of
the
two
little
boys
hilda
the
poor
little
twins
yes
solness
they
came
healthy
and
bonny
into
the
world
and
they
were
growing
too
you
could
see
the
difference
day
to
day
hilda
little
children
do
grow
quickly
at
first
solness
it
was
the
prettiest
sight
in
the
world
to
see
aline
lying
with
the
two
of
them
in
her
but
then
came
the
night
of
the
fire
hilda
excitedly
what
happened
do
tell
me
was
any
one
burnt
solness
no
not
that
every
one
got
safe
and
sound
out
of
the
house
hilda
well
and
what
then
solness
the
fright
had
shaken
aline
terribly
the
alarm
the
escape
the
hurry
and
then
the
night
air
for
they
had
to
be
carried
out
just
as
they
lay
both
she
and
the
little
ones
hilda
was
it
too
much
for
them
solness
oh
no
they
stood
it
well
enough
but
aline
fell
into
a
fever
and
it
affected
her
milk
she
would
insist
on
nursing
them
herself
because
it
was
her
duty
she
said
and
both
our
little
boys
they
clenching
his
they
oh
hilda
they
did
not
get
over
that
solness
no
that
they
did
not
get
over
that
was
how
we
lost
them
hilda
it
must
have
been
terribly
hard
for
you
solness
hard
enough
for
me
but
ten
time
harder
for
aline
clenching
his
hands
in
suppressed
fury
oh
that
such
things
should
be
allowed
to
happen
here
the
world
shortly
and
firmly
from
the
day
i
lost
them
i
had
no
heart
for
building
churches
hilda
did
you
not
like
building
the
in
our
town
solness
i
did
like
it
i
know
how
free
and
happy
i
felt
when
that
tower
was
finished
hilda
know
that
too
solness
and
now
i
shall
never
never
build
anything
of
that
sort
again
neither
churches
nor
hilda
nods
slowly
nothing
but
houses
for
people
to
live
in
solness
homes
for
human
beings
hilda
hilda
but
homes
with
high
towers
and
pinnacles
upon
them
solness
if
possible
adopts
a
lighter
tone
but
as
i
said
before
that
fire
was
the
making
of
me
as
a
builder
i
mean
hilda
why
do
you
call
yourself
an
architect
like
the
others
solness
i
have
not
been
systematically
enough
taught
for
that
most
of
what
i
know
i
have
found
out
for
myself
hilda
but
you
succeeded
all
the
same
solness
yes
thanks
to
the
fire
i
laid
out
almost
the
whole
of
the
garden
in
villa
lots
and
there
i
was
able
to
build
after
my
own
heart
so
i
came
to
the
front
with
a
rush
hilda
looks
keenly
at
him
you
must
surely
be
a
very
happy
man
as
matters
stand
with
you
solness
gloomily
happy
do
you
say
that
too
like
all
the
rest
of
them
hilda
yes
i
should
say
you
must
be
if
you
could
only
cease
thing
about
the
two
little
children
solness
slowly
the
two
little
children
they
are
not
so
easy
to
forget
hilda
hilda
somewhat
uncertainly
do
you
still
feel
their
loss
so
much
after
all
these
years
solness
looks
fixedly
at
her
without
replying
a
happy
man
you
said
hilda
well
now
are
you
not
happy
in
other
respects
solness
continues
to
look
at
her
when
i
told
you
all
this
about
the
fire
h
hilda
well
solness
was
there
not
one
special
thought
that
you
that
you
seized
upon
hilda
reflects
in
vain
no
what
thought
should
that
be
solness
with
subdued
emphasis
it
was
simply
and
solely
by
that
fire
that
i
was
enabled
to
build
homes
for
human
beings
cosy
comfortable
bright
homes
where
father
and
mother
and
the
whole
troop
of
children
can
live
in
safety
and
gladness
feeling
what
a
happy
thing
it
is
to
be
alive
in
the
world
and
most
of
all
to
belong
to
each
other
in
great
things
and
in
small
hilda
ardently
well
and
is
it
not
a
great
happiness
for
you
to
be
able
to
build
such
beautiful
homes
solness
the
price
hilda
the
terrible
price
i
had
to
pay
for
the
opportunity
hilda
but
can
you
never
get
over
that
solness
no
that
i
might
build
homes
for
others
i
had
to
forego
to
forego
for
all
time
the
home
that
might
have
been
my
own
i
mean
a
home
for
a
troop
of
children
and
for
father
and
mother
too
hilda
cautiously
but
need
you
have
done
that
for
all
time
you
say
solness
nods
slowly
that
was
the
price
of
this
happiness
that
people
talk
about
breathes
heavily
this
happiness
h
this
happiness
was
not
to
be
bought
any
cheaper
hilda
hilda
as
before
but
may
it
not
come
right
even
yet
solness
never
in
this
world
never
that
is
another
consequence
of
the
fire
and
of
aline
illness
afterwards
hilda
looks
at
him
with
an
indefinable
expression
and
yet
you
build
all
these
nurseries
solness
seriously
have
you
never
noticed
hilda
how
the
impossible
how
it
seems
to
beckon
and
cry
aloud
to
one
hilda
reflecting
the
impossible
with
animation
yes
indeed
is
that
how
you
feel
too
solness
yes
i
do
hilda
then
there
must
be
a
little
of
the
troll
in
you
too
solness
why
of
the
troll
hilda
what
would
you
call
it
then
solness
rises
well
well
perhaps
you
are
right
vehemently
but
how
can
i
help
turning
into
a
troll
when
this
is
how
it
always
goes
with
me
in
everything
in
everything
hilda
how
do
you
mean
solness
speaking
low
with
inward
emotion
mark
what
i
say
to
you
hilda
all
that
i
have
succeeded
in
doing
building
creating
all
the
beauty
security
cheerful
comfort
ay
and
magnificence
too
clenches
his
hands
oh
is
it
not
terrible
even
to
think
of
hilda
what
is
so
terrible
solness
that
all
this
i
have
to
make
up
for
to
pay
for
not
in
money
but
in
human
happiness
and
not
with
my
own
happiness
only
but
with
other
people
too
yes
yes
do
you
see
that
hilda
that
is
the
price
which
my
position
as
an
artist
has
cost
me
and
others
and
every
single
day
i
have
to
look
on
while
the
price
is
paid
for
me
anew
over
again
and
over
again
and
over
again
for
ever
hilda
rises
and
looks
steadily
at
him
now
i
can
see
that
you
are
thinking
of
of
her
solness
yes
mainly
of
aline
for
aline
she
too
had
her
vocation
in
life
just
as
much
as
i
had
mine
his
voice
quivers
but
her
vocation
has
had
to
be
stunted
and
crushed
and
shattered
in
order
that
mine
might
force
its
way
to
to
a
sort
of
great
victory
for
you
must
know
that
aline
she
too
had
a
talent
for
building
hilda
she
for
building
solness
shakes
his
head
not
houses
and
towers
and
spires
not
such
things
as
i
work
away
at
hilda
well
but
what
then
solness
softly
with
emotion
for
building
up
the
souls
of
little
children
hilda
for
building
up
children
souls
in
perfect
balance
and
in
noble
and
beautiful
forms
for
enabling
them
to
soar
up
into
erect
and
human
souls
that
was
aline
talent
and
there
it
all
lies
now
unused
and
unusable
for
ever
of
no
earthly
service
to
any
one
just
like
the
ruins
left
by
a
fire
hilda
yes
but
even
if
this
were
so
solness
it
is
so
it
is
so
i
know
it
hilda
well
but
in
any
case
it
is
not
your
fault
solness
fixes
his
eyes
on
her
and
nods
slowly
ah
that
is
the
great
the
terrible
question
that
is
the
doubt
that
is
gnawing
me
night
and
day
hilda
that
solness
yes
suppose
the
fault
was
mine
in
a
certain
sense
hilda
your
fault
the
fire
solness
all
of
it
the
whole
thing
and
yet
perhaps
i
may
not
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it
hilda
looks
at
him
with
a
troubled
expression
oh
solness
if
you
can
talk
like
that
i
am
afraid
you
must
be
ill
after
all
solness
h
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
be
of
quite
sound
mind
on
that
point
ragnar
brovik
cautiously
opens
the
little
door
in
the
hand
corner
hilda
comes
forward
ragnar
when
he
sees
hilda
oh
i
beg
pardon
solness
he
makes
a
movement
to
withdraw
solness
no
no
do
go
let
us
get
it
over
ragnar
oh
yes
if
only
we
could
solness
i
hear
your
father
is
no
better
ragnar
father
is
fast
growing
weaker
and
therefore
i
beg
and
implore
you
to
write
a
few
kind
words
for
me
on
one
of
the
plans
something
for
father
to
read
before
he
solness
vehemently
i
wo
hear
anything
more
about
those
drawings
of
yours
ragnar
have
you
looked
at
them
solness
yes
i
have
ragnar
and
they
are
good
for
nothing
and
am
good
for
nothing
too
solness
evasively
stay
here
with
me
ragnar
you
shall
have
everything
your
own
way
and
then
you
can
marry
kaia
and
live
at
your
ease
and
happily
too
who
knows
only
do
think
of
building
on
your
own
account
ragnar
well
well
then
i
must
go
home
and
tell
father
what
you
say
i
promised
i
is
this
what
i
am
to
tell
father
before
he
dies
solness
with
a
groan
oh
tell
him
tell
him
what
you
will
for
me
best
to
say
nothing
at
all
to
him
with
a
sudden
outburst
i
can
not
do
anything
else
ragnar
ragnar
may
i
have
the
drawings
to
take
with
me
solness
yes
take
them
take
them
by
all
means
they
are
lying
there
on
the
table
ragnar
goes
to
the
table
thanks
hilda
puts
her
hand
on
the
portfolio
no
no
leave
them
here
solness
why
hilda
because
i
want
to
look
at
them
too
solness
but
you
have
been
to
ragnar
well
leave
them
here
then
ragnar
very
well
solness
and
go
home
at
once
to
your
father
ragnar
yes
i
suppose
i
must
solness
as
if
in
desperation
ragnar
you
must
not
ask
me
to
do
what
is
beyond
my
power
do
you
hear
ragnar
you
must
not
ragnar
no
no
i
beg
you
pardon
he
bows
and
goes
out
by
the
corner
door
hilda
goes
over
and
sits
down
on
a
chair
near
the
mirror
hilda
looks
angrily
at
solness
that
was
a
very
ugly
thing
to
do
solness
do
you
think
so
too
hilda
yes
it
was
horribly
ugly
and
hard
and
bad
and
cruel
as
well
solness
oh
you
do
understand
my
position
hilda
no
matter
i
say
you
ought
not
to
be
like
that
solness
you
said
yourself
only
just
now
that
no
one
but
ought
to
be
allowed
to
build
hilda
may
say
such
things
but
you
must
not
solness
i
most
of
all
surely
who
have
paid
so
dear
for
my
position
hilda
oh
yes
with
what
you
call
domestic
comfort
and
that
sort
of
thing
solness
and
with
my
peace
of
soul
into
the
bargain
hilda
rising
peace
of
soul
with
feeling
yes
yes
you
are
right
in
that
poor
solness
you
fancy
that
solness
with
a
quiet
chuckling
laugh
just
sit
down
again
hilda
and
tell
you
something
funny
hilda
sits
down
with
intent
interest
well
solness
it
sounds
such
a
ludicrous
little
thing
for
you
see
the
whole
story
turns
upon
nothing
but
a
crack
in
the
chimney
hilda
no
more
than
that
solness
no
not
to
begin
with
he
moves
a
chair
nearer
to
hilda
and
sits
down
hilda
impatiently
taps
on
her
knee
well
now
for
the
crack
in
the
chimney
solness
i
had
noticed
the
split
in
the
flue
long
long
before
the
fire
every
time
i
went
up
into
the
attic
i
looked
to
see
if
it
was
still
there
hilda
and
it
was
solness
yes
for
no
one
else
knew
about
it
hilda
and
you
said
nothing
solness
nothing
hilda
and
did
not
think
of
repairing
the
flue
either
solness
oh
yes
i
thought
about
it
but
never
got
any
further
every
time
i
intended
to
set
to
work
it
seemed
just
as
if
a
hand
held
me
back
not
i
thought
and
nothing
ever
came
of
it
hilda
but
why
did
you
keep
putting
it
off
like
that
solness
because
i
was
revolving
something
in
my
mind
slowly
and
in
a
low
voice
through
that
little
black
crack
in
the
chimney
i
might
perhaps
force
my
way
upwards
as
a
builder
hilda
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
that
must
have
been
thrilling
solness
almost
irresistible
quite
irresistible
for
at
that
time
it
appeared
to
me
a
perfectly
simple
and
straightforward
matter
i
would
have
had
it
happen
in
the
a
little
before
midday
i
was
to
be
out
driving
aline
in
the
sleigh
the
servants
at
home
would
have
made
huge
fires
in
the
stoves
hilda
for
of
course
it
was
to
be
bitterly
cold
that
day
solness
rather
biting
yes
and
they
would
want
aline
to
find
it
thoroughly
snug
and
warm
when
she
came
home
hilda
i
suppose
she
is
very
chilly
by
nature
solness
she
is
and
as
we
drove
home
we
were
to
see
the
smoke
hilda
only
the
smoke
solness
the
smoke
first
but
when
we
came
up
to
the
garden
gate
the
whole
of
the
old
was
to
be
a
rolling
mass
of
that
is
how
i
wanted
it
to
be
you
see
hilda
oh
why
why
could
it
not
have
happened
so
solness
you
may
well
say
that
hilda
hilda
well
but
now
listen
solness
are
you
perfectly
certain
that
the
fire
was
caused
by
that
little
crack
in
the
chimney
solness
no
on
the
contrary
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
the
crack
in
the
chimney
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
fire
hilda
what
solness
it
has
been
clearly
ascertained
that
the
fire
broke
out
in
a
in
a
totally
different
part
of
the
house
hilda
then
what
is
all
this
nonsense
you
are
talking
about
the
crack
in
the
chimney
solness
may
i
go
on
talking
to
you
a
little
hilda
hilda
yes
if
you
only
talk
sensibly
solness
i
will
try
to
he
moves
his
chair
nearer
hilda
out
with
it
then
solness
solness
confidentially
do
you
agree
with
me
hilda
that
there
exist
special
chosen
people
who
have
been
endowed
with
the
power
and
faculty
if
desiring
a
thing
craving
for
a
thing
willing
a
thing
so
persistently
and
so
so
inexorably
that
at
last
it
has
to
happen
you
believe
that
hilda
with
an
indefinable
expression
in
her
eyes
if
that
is
so
we
shall
see
one
of
these
days
whether
am
one
of
the
chosen
solness
it
is
not
one
self
alone
that
can
do
such
great
things
oh
no
the
helpers
and
the
servers
they
must
do
their
part
too
if
it
is
to
be
of
any
good
but
they
never
come
of
themselves
one
has
to
call
upon
them
very
persistently
inwardly
you
understand
hilda
what
are
these
helpers
and
servers
solness
oh
we
can
talk
about
that
some
other
time
for
the
present
let
us
keep
to
this
business
of
the
fire
hilda
do
you
think
that
fire
would
have
happened
all
the
same
even
without
your
wishing
for
it
solness
if
the
house
had
been
old
knut
brovik
it
would
never
have
burnt
down
so
conveniently
for
him
i
am
sure
of
that
for
he
does
not
know
how
to
call
for
the
helpers
no
nor
for
the
servers
either
rises
in
unrest
so
you
see
hilda
it
is
my
fault
after
all
that
the
lives
of
the
two
little
boys
had
to
be
sacrificed
and
do
you
think
it
is
not
my
fault
too
that
aline
has
never
been
the
woman
she
should
and
might
have
been
and
that
she
most
longed
to
be
hilda
yes
but
if
it
is
all
the
work
of
these
helpers
and
servers
solness
who
called
for
the
helpers
and
servers
it
was
i
and
they
came
and
obeyed
my
will
in
increasing
excitement
that
is
what
people
call
having
the
luck
on
your
side
but
i
must
tell
you
what
this
sort
of
luck
feels
like
it
feels
like
a
great
raw
place
here
on
my
breast
and
the
helpers
and
servers
keep
on
flaying
pieces
of
skin
off
other
people
in
order
to
close
my
sore
but
still
the
sore
is
not
healed
never
never
oh
if
you
knew
how
it
can
sometimes
gnaw
and
burn
hilda
looks
attentively
at
him
you
are
ill
solness
very
ill
i
almost
think
solness
say
mad
for
that
is
what
you
mean
hilda
no
i
do
think
there
is
much
amiss
with
your
intellect
solness
with
what
then
out
with
it
hilda
i
wonder
whether
you
were
not
sent
into
the
world
with
a
sickly
conscience
solness
a
sickly
conscience
what
devilry
is
that
hilda
i
mean
that
your
conscience
is
feeble
too
delicately
built
as
it
were
has
strength
to
take
a
grip
of
things
to
lift
and
bear
what
is
heavy
solness
growls
h
may
i
ask
then
what
sort
of
a
conscience
one
ought
to
have
hilda
i
should
like
your
conscience
to
be
to
be
thoroughly
robust
solness
indeed
robust
eh
is
your
own
conscience
robust
may
i
ask
hilda
yes
i
think
it
is
i
have
never
noticed
that
it
was
solness
it
has
not
been
put
very
severely
to
the
test
i
should
think
hilda
with
a
quivering
of
the
lips
oh
it
was
no
such
simple
matter
to
leave
father
i
am
so
awfully
fond
of
him
solness
dear
me
for
a
month
or
two
hilda
i
think
i
shall
never
go
home
again
solness
never
then
why
did
you
leave
him
hilda
have
you
forgotten
again
that
the
ten
year
are
up
solness
oh
nonsense
was
anything
wrong
at
home
eh
hilda
quite
seriously
it
was
this
impulse
within
me
that
urged
and
goaded
me
to
come
and
lured
and
drew
me
on
as
well
solness
eagerly
there
we
have
it
there
we
have
it
hilda
there
is
the
troll
in
you
too
as
in
me
for
it
the
troll
in
one
you
see
it
is
that
that
calls
to
the
powers
outside
us
and
then
you
must
give
in
whether
you
will
or
no
hilda
i
almost
think
you
are
right
solness
solness
walks
about
the
room
oh
there
are
devils
innumerable
abroad
in
the
world
hilda
that
one
never
sees
hilda
devils
too
solness
stops
good
devils
and
bad
devils
devils
and
devils
if
only
you
could
always
tell
whether
it
is
the
light
or
dark
ones
that
have
got
hold
of
you
paces
about
then
it
would
be
simple
enough
hilda
follows
him
with
her
eyes
or
if
one
had
a
really
vigorous
radiantly
healthy
conscience
so
that
one
dared
to
do
what
one
would
solness
stops
beside
the
console
table
i
believe
now
that
most
people
are
just
as
puny
creatures
as
i
am
in
that
respect
hilda
i
should
wonder
solness
leaning
against
the
table
in
the
sagas
have
you
read
any
of
the
old
sagas
hilda
oh
yes
when
i
used
to
read
books
i
solness
in
the
sagas
you
read
about
vikings
who
sailed
to
foreign
lands
and
plundered
and
burned
and
killed
men
hilda
and
carried
off
women
solness
and
kept
them
in
captivity
hilda
took
them
home
in
their
ships
solness
and
behaved
to
them
like
like
the
very
worst
of
trolls
hilda
looks
straight
before
her
with
a
look
i
think
that
must
have
been
thrilling
solness
with
a
short
deep
laugh
to
carry
off
women
eh
hilda
to
be
carried
off
solness
looks
at
her
a
moment
oh
indeed
hilda
as
if
breaking
the
thread
of
the
conversation
but
what
made
you
speak
of
these
vikings
solness
solness
why
those
fellows
must
have
had
robust
consciences
if
you
like
when
they
got
home
again
they
could
eat
and
drink
and
be
as
happy
as
children
and
the
women
too
they
often
would
not
leave
them
on
any
account
can
you
understand
that
hilda
hilda
those
women
i
can
understand
exceedingly
well
solness
oho
perhaps
you
could
do
the
same
yourself
hilda
why
not
solness
live
of
your
own
free
will
with
a
ruffian
like
that
hilda
if
it
was
a
ruffian
i
had
come
to
love
solness
could
you
come
to
love
a
man
like
that
hilda
good
heavens
you
know
very
well
one
ca
choose
whom
one
is
going
to
love
solness
looks
meditatively
at
her
oh
no
i
suppose
it
is
the
troll
within
one
that
responsible
for
that
hilda
and
all
those
blessed
devils
that
you
know
so
well
both
the
and
the
ones
solness
quietly
and
warmly
then
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
the
devils
will
choose
carefully
for
you
hilda
hilda
for
me
they
have
chosen
already
once
and
for
all
solness
looks
earnestly
at
her
hilda
you
are
like
a
wild
bird
of
the
woods
hilda
far
from
it
i
do
hide
myself
away
under
the
bushes
solness
no
no
there
is
rather
something
of
the
bird
of
prey
in
you
hilda
that
is
nearer
it
perhaps
very
vehemently
and
why
not
a
bird
of
prey
why
should
not
go
i
as
well
as
the
rest
carry
off
the
prey
i
want
if
only
i
can
get
my
claws
into
it
and
do
with
it
as
i
will
solness
hilda
do
you
know
what
you
are
hilda
yes
i
suppose
i
am
a
strange
sort
of
bird
solness
no
you
are
like
a
dawning
day
when
i
look
at
you
i
seem
to
be
looking
towards
the
sunrise
hilda
tell
me
solness
are
you
certain
that
you
have
never
called
me
to
you
inwardly
you
know
solness
softly
and
slowly
i
almost
think
i
must
have
hilda
what
did
you
want
with
me
solness
you
are
the
younger
generation
hilda
hilda
smiles
that
younger
generation
that
you
are
so
afraid
of
solness
nods
slowly
and
which
in
my
heart
i
yearn
towards
so
deeply
hilda
rises
goes
to
the
little
table
and
fetches
ragnar
brovik
portfolio
hilda
holds
out
the
portfolio
to
him
we
were
talking
of
these
drawings
solness
shortly
waving
them
away
put
those
things
away
i
have
seen
enough
of
them
hilda
yes
but
you
have
to
write
your
approval
on
them
solness
write
my
approval
on
them
never
hilda
but
the
poor
old
man
is
lying
at
death
door
ca
you
give
him
and
his
son
this
pleasure
before
they
are
parted
and
perhaps
he
might
get
the
commission
to
carry
them
out
too
solness
yes
that
is
just
what
he
would
get
he
has
made
sure
of
that
has
my
fine
gentleman
hilda
then
good
heavens
if
that
is
so
ca
you
tell
the
least
little
bit
of
a
lie
for
once
in
a
way
solness
a
lie
raging
hilda
take
those
devil
drawings
out
of
my
sight
hilda
draws
the
portfolio
a
little
nearer
to
herself
well
well
well
do
bite
you
talk
of
trolls
but
i
think
you
go
on
like
a
troll
yourself
looks
round
where
do
you
keep
your
pen
and
ink
solness
there
is
nothing
of
the
sort
in
here
hilda
goes
towards
the
door
but
in
the
office
where
that
young
lady
is
solness
stay
where
you
are
hilda
i
ought
to
tell
a
lie
you
say
oh
yes
for
the
sake
of
his
old
father
i
might
well
do
that
for
in
my
time
i
have
crushed
him
trodden
him
under
foot
hilda
him
too
solness
i
needed
room
for
myself
but
this
ragnar
he
must
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
come
to
the
front
hilda
poor
fellow
there
is
surely
no
fear
of
that
if
he
has
nothing
in
him
solness
comes
closer
looks
at
her
and
whispers
if
ragnar
brovik
gets
his
chance
he
will
strike
me
to
the
earth
crush
me
as
i
crushed
his
father
hilda
crush
you
has
he
the
ability
for
that
solness
yes
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
has
the
ability
he
is
the
younger
generation
that
stands
ready
to
knock
at
my
door
to
make
an
end
of
halvard
solness
hilda
looks
at
him
with
quiet
reproach
and
yet
you
would
bar
him
out
fie
solness
solness
the
fight
i
have
been
fighting
has
cost
heart
blood
and
i
am
afraid
too
that
the
helpers
and
servers
will
not
obey
me
any
longer
hilda
then
you
must
go
ahead
without
them
there
is
nothing
else
for
it
solness
it
is
hopeless
hilda
the
luck
is
bound
to
turn
a
little
sooner
or
a
little
later
retribution
is
inexorable
hilda
in
distress
putting
her
hands
over
her
ears
do
talk
like
that
do
you
want
to
kill
me
to
take
from
me
what
is
more
than
my
life
solness
and
what
is
that
hilda
the
longing
to
see
you
great
to
see
you
with
a
wreath
in
your
hand
high
high
up
upon
a
calm
again

out
with
your
pencil
now

must
have
a
pencil
about
you
solness

out
his

have
one

portfolio

very
well

seats
himself
at
the
table
hilda
stands
behind
him
leaning
over
the
back
of
the
chair
and
now

on
the
drawings

must
write
very
very
nicely
and
cordially
for
this
horrid
ruar

few
words

the
person
to
stand
at
a
desk
solness
never
mind
never
mind

will
be
all

our
new
home

quickly

will
hang
up
the
wreath
turns
to
hilda
what
do
you
say
to
that
miss
hilda
hilda
looks
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
it
will
be
splendid
to
see
you
so
high
up
once
more
solness
me
solness
for
heaven
sake
miss
wangel
do
imagine
such
a
thing
my
husband
when
he
always
gets
so
dizzy
hilda
he
get
dizzy
no
i
know
quite
well
he
does
not
solness
oh
yes
indeed
he
does
hilda
but
i
have
seen
him
with
my
own
eyes
right
up
at
the
top
of
a
high
solness
yes
i
hear
people
talk
of
that
but
it
is
utterly
impossible
solness
vehemently
impossible
impossible
yes
but
there
i
stood
all
the
same
solness
o
how
can
you
say
so
halvard
why
you
ca
even
bear
to
go
out
on
the
balcony
here
you
have
always
been
like
that
solness
you
may
perhaps
see
something
different
this
evening
solness
in
alarm
no
no
no
please
god
i
shall
never
see
that
i
will
write
at
once
to
the
doctor
and
i
am
sure
he
wo
let
you
do
it
solness
why
aline
solness
oh
you
know
you
ill
halvard
this
proves
it
oh
god
oh
god
she
goes
hastily
out
to
the
right
hilda
looks
intently
at
him
is
it
so
or
is
it
not
solness
that
i
turn
dizzy
hilda
that
my
master
builder
dares
not
can
not
climb
as
high
as
he
builds
solness
is
that
the
way
you
look
at
it
hilda
yes
solness
i
believe
there
is
scarcely
a
corner
in
me
that
is
safe
from
you
hilda
looks
towards
the
up
there
then
right
up
there
solness
approaches
her
you
might
have
the
topmost
room
in
the
tower
hilda
there
you
might
live
like
a
princess
hilda
indefinably
between
earnest
and
jest
yes
that
is
what
you
promised
me
solness
did
i
really
hilda
fie
solness
you
said
i
should
be
a
princess
and
that
you
would
give
me
a
kingdom
and
then
you
went
and
well
solness
cautiously
are
you
quite
certain
that
this
is
not
a
dream
a
fancy
that
has
fixed
itself
in
your
mind
hilda
sharply
do
you
mean
that
you
did
not
do
it
solness
i
scarcely
know
myself
more
softly
but
now
i
know
so
much
for
certain
that
i
hilda
that
you
say
it
at
once
solness
that
i
ought
to
have
done
it
hilda
exclaims
with
animation
do
tell
me
you
can
ever
be
dizzy
solness
this
evening
then
we
will
hang
up
the
wreath
princess
hilda
hilda
with
a
bitter
curve
of
the
lips
over
your
new
home
yes
solness
over
the
new
house
which
will
never
be
a
home
for
me
he
goes
out
through
the
garden
door
hilda
looks
straight
in
front
of
her
with
a
expression
and
whispers
to
herself
the
only
words
audible
are
frightfully
thrilling
act
third
the
large
broad
verandah
of
solness
part
of
the
house
with
outer
door
leading
to
the
verandah
is
seen
to
the
left
a
railing
along
the
verandah
to
the
right
at
the
back
from
the
end
of
the
verandah
a
flight
of
steps
leads
down
to
the
garden
below
tall
old
trees
in
the
garden
spread
their
branches
over
the
verandah
and
towards
the
house
far
to
the
right
in
among
the
trees
a
glimpse
is
caught
of
the
lower
part
of
the
new
villa
with
scaffolding
round
so
much
as
is
seen
of
the
tower
in
the
background
the
garden
is
bounded
by
an
old
wooden
fence
outside
the
fence
a
street
with
low
cottages
evening
sky
with
clouds
on
the
verandah
a
garden
bench
stands
along
the
wall
of
the
house
and
in
front
of
the
bench
a
long
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
an
and
some
stools
all
the
furniture
is
of
solness
wrapped
in
a
large
white
crepe
shawl
sits
resting
in
the
and
gazes
over
to
the
right
shortly
after
hilda
wangel
comes
up
the
flight
of
steps
from
the
garden
she
is
dressed
as
in
the
last
act
and
wears
her
hat
she
has
in
her
bodice
a
little
nosegay
of
small
common
flowers
solness
turning
her
head
a
little
have
you
been
round
the
garden
miss
wangel
hilda
yes
i
have
been
taking
a
look
at
it
solness
and
found
some
flowers
too
i
see
hilda
yes
indeed
there
are
such
heaps
of
them
in
among
the
bushes
solness
are
there
really
still
you
see
i
scarcely
ever
go
there
hilda
closer
what
do
you
take
a
run
down
into
the
garden
every
day
then
solness
with
a
faint
smile
i
do
run
anywhere
nowadays
hilda
well
but
do
you
not
go
down
now
and
then
to
look
at
all
the
lovely
things
there
solness
it
has
all
become
so
strange
to
me
i
am
almost
afraid
to
see
it
again
hilda
your
own
garden
solness
i
do
feel
that
it
is
mine
any
longer
hilda
what
do
you
mean
solness
no
no
it
is
not
not
as
it
was
in
my
mother
and
father
time
they
have
taken
away
so
much
so
much
of
the
garden
miss
wangel
fancy
they
have
parcelled
it
out
and
built
houses
for
strangers
people
that
i
do
know
and
they
can
sit
and
look
in
upon
me
from
their
windows
hilda
with
a
bright
expression
solness
solness
yes
hilda
may
i
stay
here
with
you
a
little
solness
yes
by
all
means
if
you
care
to
hilda
moves
a
stool
close
to
the
and
sits
down
hilda
ah
here
one
can
sit
and
sun
oneself
like
a
cat
solness
lays
her
hand
softly
on
hilda
neck
it
is
nice
of
you
to
be
willing
to
sit
with
me
i
thought
you
wanted
to
go
in
to
my
husband
hilda
what
should
i
want
with
him
solness
to
help
him
i
thought
hilda
no
thank
you
and
besides
he
is
not
in
he
is
over
there
with
his
workmen
but
he
looked
so
fierce
that
i
did
not
dare
to
talk
to
him
solness
he
is
so
kind
and
gentle
in
reality
hilda
he
solness
you
do
not
really
know
him
yet
miss
wangel
hilda
looks
affectionately
at
her
are
you
pleased
at
the
thought
of
moving
over
to
the
new
house
solness
i
ought
to
be
pleased
for
it
is
what
halvard
wants
hilda
oh
not
just
on
that
account
surely
solness
yes
yes
miss
wangel
for
it
is
only
my
duty
to
submit
myself
to
him
but
very
often
it
is
dreadfully
difficult
to
force
one
mind
to
obedience
hilda
yes
that
must
be
difficult
indeed
solness
i
can
tell
you
it
is
when
one
has
so
many
faults
as
i
have
hilda
when
one
has
gone
through
so
much
trouble
as
you
have
solness
how
do
you
know
about
that
hilda
your
husband
told
me
solness
to
me
he
very
seldom
mentions
these
yes
i
can
tell
you
i
have
gone
through
more
than
enough
trouble
in
my
life
miss
wangel
hilda
looks
sympathetically
at
her
and
nods
slowly
poor
solness
first
of
all
there
was
the
fire
solness
with
a
sigh
yes
everything
that
was
mine
was
burnt
hilda
and
then
came
what
was
worse
solness
looking
inquiringly
at
her
worse
hilda
the
worst
of
all
solness
what
do
you
mean
hilda
softly
you
lost
the
two
little
boys
solness
oh
yes
the
boys
but
you
see
that
was
a
thing
apart
that
was
a
dispensation
of
providence
and
in
such
things
one
can
only
bow
in
submission
yes
and
be
thankful
too
hilda
then
you
are
so
solness
not
always
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
know
well
enough
that
it
is
my
duty
but
all
the
same
i
can
not
hilda
no
no
i
think
that
is
only
natural
solness
and
often
and
often
i
have
to
remind
myself
that
it
was
a
righteous
punishment
for
me
hilda
why
solness
because
i
had
not
fortitude
enough
in
misfortune
hilda
but
i
do
see
that
solness
oh
no
no
miss
wangel
do
not
talk
to
me
any
more
about
the
two
little
boys
we
ought
to
feel
nothing
but
joy
in
thinking
of
them
for
they
are
so
happy
so
happy
now
no
it
is
the
small
losses
in
life
that
cut
one
to
the
heart
the
loss
of
all
that
other
people
look
upon
as
almost
nothing
hilda
lays
her
arms
on
solness
knees
and
looks
up
at
her
affectionately
dear
solness
tell
me
what
things
you
mean
solness
as
i
say
only
little
things
all
the
old
portraits
were
burnt
on
the
walls
and
all
the
old
silk
dresses
were
burnt
what
had
belonged
to
the
family
for
generations
and
generations
and
all
mother
and
grandmother
lace
that
was
burnt
too
and
only
think
the
jewels
too
sadly
and
then
all
the
dolls
hilda
the
dolls
solness
choking
with
tears
i
had
nine
lovely
dolls
hilda
and
they
were
burnt
too
solness
all
of
them
oh
it
was
hard
so
hard
for
me
hilda
had
you
put
by
all
these
dolls
then
ever
since
you
were
little
solness
i
had
not
put
them
by
the
dolls
and
i
had
gone
on
living
together
hilda
after
you
were
grown
up
solness
yes
long
after
that
hilda
after
you
were
married
too
solness
oh
yes
indeed
so
long
as
he
did
not
see
it
but
they
were
all
burnt
up
poor
things
no
one
thought
of
saving
them
oh
it
is
so
miserable
to
think
of
you
must
laugh
at
me
miss
wangel
hilda
i
am
not
laughing
in
the
least
solness
for
you
see
in
a
certain
sense
there
was
life
in
them
too
i
carried
them
under
my
heart
like
little
unborn
children
herdal
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
comes
out
through
the
door
and
observes
solness
and
hilda
herdal
well
solness
so
you
are
sitting
out
here
catching
cold
solness
i
find
it
so
pleasant
and
warm
here
herdal
yes
yes
but
is
there
anything
going
on
here
i
got
a
note
from
you
solness
rises
yes
there
is
something
i
must
talk
to
you
about
herdal
very
well
then
perhaps
we
better
go
in
to
hilda
still
in
your
mountaineering
dress
miss
wangel
hilda
gaily
rising
yes
in
full
uniform
but
i
am
not
going
climbing
and
breaking
my
neck
we
two
will
stop
quietly
below
and
look
on
doctor
herdal
what
are
we
to
look
on
at
solness
softly
in
alarm
to
hilda
hush
hush
for
god
sake
he
is
coming
try
to
get
that
idea
out
of
his
head
and
let
us
be
friends
miss
wangel
do
you
think
we
can
hilda
throws
her
arms
impetuously
round
solness
neck
oh
if
we
only
could
solness
gently
disengages
herself
there
there
there
there
he
comes
doctor
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
herdal
is
it
about
him
solness
yes
to
be
sure
it
about
him
do
come
in
she
and
the
doctor
enter
the
house
next
moment
solness
comes
up
from
the
garden
by
the
flight
of
steps
a
serious
look
comes
over
hilda
face
solness
glances
at
the
which
is
closed
cautiously
from
within
have
you
noticed
hilda
that
as
soon
as
i
come
she
goes
hilda
i
have
noticed
that
as
soon
as
you
come
you
make
her
go
solness
perhaps
so
but
i
can
not
help
it
looks
observantly
at
her
are
you
cold
hilda
i
think
you
look
cold
hilda
i
have
just
come
up
out
of
a
tomb
solness
what
do
you
mean
by
that
hilda
that
i
have
got
chilled
through
and
through
solness
solness
slowly
i
believe
i
understand
hilda
what
brings
you
up
here
just
now
solness
i
caught
sight
of
you
from
over
there
hilda
but
then
you
must
have
seen
her
too
solness
i
knew
she
would
go
at
once
if
i
came
hilda
is
it
very
painful
for
you
that
she
should
avoid
you
in
this
way
solness
in
one
sense
it
a
relief
as
well
hilda
not
to
have
her
before
your
eyes
solness
yes
hilda
not
to
be
always
seeing
how
heavily
the
loss
of
the
little
boys
weighs
upon
her
solness
yes
chiefly
that
hilda
drifts
across
the
verandah
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
stops
at
the
railing
and
looks
out
over
the
garden
solness
after
a
short
pause
did
you
have
a
long
talk
with
her
hilda
stands
motionless
and
does
not
answer
solness
had
you
a
long
talk
i
asked
hilda
is
silent
as
before
solness
what
was
she
talking
about
hilda
hilda
continues
silent
solness
poor
aline
i
suppose
it
was
about
the
little
boys
hilda
a
nervous
shudder
runs
through
her
then
she
nods
hurriedly
once
or
twice
solness
she
will
never
get
over
it
never
in
this
world
approaches
her
now
you
are
standing
there
again
like
a
statue
just
as
you
stood
last
night
hilda
turns
and
looks
at
him
with
great
serious
eyes
i
am
going
away
solness
sharply
going
away
hilda
yes
solness
but
i
wo
allow
you
to
hilda
what
am
i
to
do
here
now
solness
simply
to
be
here
hilda
hilda
measures
him
with
a
look
oh
thank
you
you
know
it
would
end
there
solness
heedlessly
so
much
the
better
hilda
vehemently
i
can
not
do
any
harm
to
one
whom
i
know
i
ca
take
away
anything
that
belongs
to
her
solness
who
wants
you
to
do
that
hilda
continuing
a
stranger
yes
for
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
a
person
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
but
one
that
i
have
come
into
close
contact
with
oh
no
oh
no
ugh
solness
yes
but
i
never
proposed
you
should
hilda
oh
solness
you
know
quite
well
what
the
end
of
it
would
be
and
that
is
why
i
am
going
away
solness
and
what
is
to
become
of
me
when
you
are
gone
what
shall
i
have
to
live
for
then
after
that
hilda
with
the
indefinable
look
in
her
eyes
it
is
surely
not
so
hard
for
you
you
have
your
duties
to
her
live
for
those
duties
solness
too
late
these
powers
these
these
hilda
devils
solness
yes
these
devils
and
the
troll
within
me
as
well
they
have
drawn
all
the
out
of
her
laughs
in
desperation
they
did
it
for
my
happiness
yes
yes
sadly
and
now
she
is
dead
for
my
sake
and
i
am
chained
alive
to
a
dead
woman
in
wild
anguish
who
can
not
live
without
joy
in
life
hilda
moves
round
the
table
and
seats
herself
on
the
bench
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
head
supported
by
her
hands
hilda
sits
and
looks
at
him
awhile
what
will
you
build
next
solness
shakes
his
head
i
do
believe
i
shall
build
much
more
hilda
not
those
cosy
happy
homes
for
mother
and
father
and
for
the
troop
of
children
solness
i
wonder
whether
there
will
be
any
use
for
such
homes
in
the
coming
time
hilda
poor
solness
and
you
have
gone
all
these
ten
years
and
staked
your
whole
life
on
that
alone
solness
yes
you
may
well
say
so
hilda
hilda
with
an
outburst
oh
it
all
seems
to
me
so
foolish
so
foolish
solness
all
what
hilda
not
to
be
able
to
grasp
at
your
own
happiness
at
your
own
life
merely
because
some
one
you
know
happens
to
stand
in
the
way
solness
one
whom
you
have
no
right
to
set
aside
hilda
i
wonder
whether
one
really
has
not
the
right
and
yet
and
yet
oh
if
one
could
only
sleep
the
whole
thing
away
she
lays
her
arms
flat
don
on
the
table
rests
the
left
side
of
her
head
on
her
hands
and
shuts
her
eyes
solness
turns
the
and
sits
down
at
the
table
had
you
a
cosy
happy
home
up
there
with
your
father
hilda
hilda
without
stirring
answers
as
if
half
asleep
i
had
only
a
cage
solness
and
you
are
determined
not
to
go
back
to
it
hilda
as
before
the
wild
bird
never
wants
to
go
back
to
the
cage
solness
rather
range
through
the
free
air
hilda
still
as
before
the
bird
of
prey
loves
to
range
solness
lets
his
eyes
rest
on
her
if
only
one
had
the
in
life
hilda
in
her
usual
voice
opens
her
eyes
but
does
not
move
and
the
other
thing
say
what
that
was
solness
a
robust
conscience
hilda
sits
erect
on
the
bench
with
animation
her
eyes
have
once
more
the
sparkling
expression
of
gladness
hilda
nods
to
him
know
what
you
are
going
to
build
next
solness
then
you
know
more
than
i
do
hilda
hilda
yes
builders
are
such
stupid
people
solness
what
is
it
to
be
then
hilda
nods
again
the
castle
solness
what
castle
hilda
my
castle
of
course
solness
do
you
want
a
castle
now
hilda
do
you
owe
me
a
kingdom
i
should
like
to
know
solness
you
say
i
do
hilda
well
you
admit
you
owe
me
this
kingdom
and
you
ca
have
a
kingdom
without
a
royal
castle
i
should
think
solness
more
and
more
animated
yes
they
usually
go
together
hilda
good
then
build
it
for
me
this
moment
solness
laughing
must
you
have
that
on
the
instant
too
hilda
yes
to
be
sure
for
the
ten
years
are
up
now
and
i
am
not
going
to
wait
any
longer
so
out
with
the
castle
solness
solness
it
no
light
matter
to
owe
you
anything
hilda
hilda
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
it
is
too
late
now
so
tapping
the
table
the
castle
on
the
table
it
is
my
castle
i
will
have
it
at
once
solness
more
seriously
leans
over
towards
her
with
his
arms
on
the
table
what
sort
of
castle
have
you
imagined
hilda
her
expression
becomes
more
and
more
veiled
she
seems
gazing
inwards
at
herself
hilda
slowly
my
castle
shall
stand
on
a
height
on
a
very
great
height
with
a
clear
outlook
on
all
sides
so
that
i
can
see
far
far
around
solness
and
no
doubt
it
is
to
have
a
high
tower
hilda
a
tremendously
high
tower
and
at
the
very
top
of
the
tower
there
shall
be
a
balcony
and
i
will
stand
out
upon
it
solness
involuntarily
clutches
at
his
forehead
how
can
you
like
to
stand
at
such
a
dizzy
height
hilda
yes
i
will
right
up
there
will
i
stand
and
look
down
on
the
other
people
on
those
that
are
building
churches
and
homes
for
mother
and
father
and
the
troop
of
children
and
you
may
come
up
and
look
on
at
it
too
solness
in
a
low
tone
is
the
builder
to
be
allowed
to
come
up
beside
the
princess
hilda
if
the
builder
will
solness
more
softly
then
i
think
the
builder
will
come
hilda
nods
the
builder
he
will
come
solness
but
he
will
never
be
able
to
build
any
more
poor
builder
hilda
animated
oh
yes
he
will
we
two
will
set
to
work
together
and
then
we
will
build
the
loveliest
the
very
loveliest
thing
in
all
the
world
solness
intently
hilda
tell
me
what
that
is
hilda
looks
smilingly
at
him
shakes
her
head
a
little
pouts
and
speaks
as
if
to
a
child
builders
they
are
such
very
very
stupid
people
solness
yes
no
doubt
they
are
stupid
but
now
tell
me
what
it
is
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
world
that
we
two
are
to
build
together
hilda
is
silent
a
little
while
then
says
with
an
indefinable
expression
in
her
eyes
castles
in
the
air
solness
castles
in
the
air
hilda
nods
castles
in
the
air
yes
do
you
know
what
sort
of
thing
a
castle
in
the
air
is
solness
it
is
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
world
you
say
hilda
rises
with
vehemence
and
makes
a
gesture
of
repulsion
with
her
hand
yes
to
be
sure
it
is
castles
in
the
air
they
are
so
easy
to
build
too
looks
scornfully
at
him
especially
for
the
builders
who
have
a
a
dizzy
conscience
solness
rises
after
this
day
we
two
will
build
together
hilda
hilda
with
a
smile
a
real
castle
in
the
air
solness
yes
one
with
a
firm
foundation
under
it
ragnar
brovik
comes
out
from
the
house
he
is
carrying
a
large
green
wreath
with
flowers
and
silk
ribbons
hilda
with
an
outburst
of
pleasure
the
wreath
oh
that
will
be
glorious
solness
in
surprise
have
you
brought
the
wreath
ragnar
ragnar
i
promised
the
foreman
i
would
solness
relieved
ah
then
i
suppose
you
father
is
better
ragnar
no
solness
was
he
not
cheered
by
what
i
wrote
ragnar
it
came
too
late
solness
too
late
ragnar
when
she
came
with
it
he
was
unconscious
he
had
had
a
stroke
solness
why
then
you
must
go
home
to
him
you
must
attend
to
your
father
ragnar
he
does
not
need
me
any
more
solness
but
surely
you
ought
to
be
with
him
ragnar
she
is
sitting
by
his
bed
solness
rather
uncertainly
kaia
ragnar
looking
darkly
at
him
yes
kaia
solness
go
home
ragnar
both
to
him
and
to
her
give
me
the
wreath
ragnar
suppresses
a
mocking
smile
you
do
mean
that
you
yourself
solness
i
will
take
it
down
to
them
myself
takes
the
wreath
from
him
and
now
you
go
home
we
do
require
you
ragnar
i
know
you
do
not
require
me
any
more
but
i
shall
remain
solness
well
remain
then
since
you
are
bent
upon
it
hilda
at
the
railing
solness
i
will
stand
here
and
look
on
at
you
solness
at
me
hilda
it
will
be
fearfully
thrilling
solness
in
a
low
tone
we
will
talk
about
that
presently
hilda
he
goes
down
the
flight
of
steps
with
the
wreath
and
away
through
the
garden
hilda
looks
after
him
then
turns
to
ragnar
i
think
you
might
at
least
have
thanked
him
ragnar
thanked
him
ought
i
to
have
thanked
him
hilda
yes
of
course
you
ought
ragnar
i
think
it
is
rather
you
i
ought
to
thank
hilda
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
ragnar
without
answering
her
but
i
advise
you
to
take
care
miss
wangel
for
you
do
know
him
rightly
yet
hilda
ardently
oh
no
one
knows
him
as
i
do
ragnar
laughs
in
exasperation
thank
him
when
he
has
held
me
down
year
after
year
when
he
made
father
disbelieve
in
me
made
me
disbelieve
in
myself
and
all
merely
that
he
might
hilda
as
if
divining
something
that
he
might
tell
me
at
once
ragnar
that
he
might
keep
her
with
him
hilda
with
a
start
towards
him
the
girl
at
the
desk
ragnar
yes
hilda
threateningly
clenching
her
hands
that
is
not
true
you
are
telling
falsehoods
about
him
ragnar
i
would
not
believe
it
either
until
when
she
said
so
herself
hilda
as
if
beside
herself
what
did
she
say
i
will
know
at
once
at
once
ragnar
she
said
that
he
had
taken
possession
of
her
mind
her
whole
mind
centred
all
her
thoughts
upon
himself
alone
she
says
that
she
can
never
leave
him
that
she
will
remain
here
where
he
is
hilda
with
flashing
eyes
she
will
not
be
allowed
to
ragnar
as
if
feeling
his
way
who
will
not
allow
her
hilda
rapidly
he
will
not
either
ragnar
oh
no
i
understand
the
whole
thing
now
after
this
she
would
merely
be
in
the
way
hilda
you
understand
nothing
since
you
can
talk
like
that
no
will
tell
you
why
he
kept
hold
of
her
ragnar
well
then
why
hilda
in
order
to
keep
hold
of
you
ragnar
has
he
told
you
so
hilda
no
but
it
is
so
it
must
be
so
wildly
i
will
i
will
have
it
so
ragnar
and
at
the
very
moment
when
you
came
he
let
her
go
hilda
it
was
you
you
that
he
let
go
what
do
you
suppose
he
cares
about
strange
women
like
her
ragnar
reflects
is
it
possible
that
all
this
time
he
has
been
afraid
of
me
hilda
he
afraid
i
would
not
be
so
conceited
if
i
were
you
ragnar
oh
he
must
have
seen
long
ago
that
i
had
something
in
me
too
besides
cowardly
that
is
just
what
he
is
you
see
hilda
he
oh
yes
i
am
likely
to
believe
that
ragnar
in
a
certain
sense
he
is
cowardly
he
the
great
master
builder
he
is
not
afraid
of
robbing
others
of
their
happiness
as
he
has
done
both
for
my
father
and
me
but
when
it
comes
to
climbing
up
a
paltry
bit
of
scaffolding
he
will
do
anything
rather
than
that
hilda
oh
you
should
just
have
seen
him
high
high
up
at
the
dizzy
height
where
i
once
saw
him
ragnar
did
you
see
that
hilda
yes
indeed
i
did
how
free
and
great
he
looked
as
he
stood
and
fastened
the
wreath
to
the
church
vane
ragnar
i
know
that
he
ventured
that
once
in
his
life
one
solitary
time
it
is
a
legend
among
us
younger
men
but
no
power
on
earth
would
induce
him
to
do
it
again
hilda
he
will
do
it
again
ragnar
scornfully
yes
i
daresay
hilda
we
shall
see
it
ragnar
that
neither
you
nor
i
will
see
hilda
with
uncontrollable
vehemence
i
will
se
it
i
will
and
i
must
see
it
ragnar
but
he
will
not
do
it
he
simply
dare
not
do
it
for
you
see
he
can
not
get
over
this
infirmity
master
builder
though
he
be
solness
comes
from
the
house
on
to
the
verandah
solness
looks
around
is
he
not
here
where
has
he
gone
to
ragnar
solness
is
down
with
the
men
hilda
he
took
the
wreath
with
him
solness
terrified
took
the
wreath
with
him
oh
god
oh
god
brovik
you
must
go
down
to
him
get
him
to
come
back
here
ragnar
shall
i
say
you
want
to
speak
to
him
solness
solness
oh
yes
do
no
no
do
say
that
want
anything
you
can
say
that
somebody
is
here
and
that
he
must
come
at
once
ragnar
good
i
will
do
so
solness
he
goes
down
the
flight
of
steps
and
away
through
the
garden
solness
oh
miss
wangel
you
ca
think
how
anxious
i
feel
about
him
hilda
is
there
anything
in
this
to
be
terribly
frightened
about
solness
oh
yes
surely
you
can
understand
just
think
if
he
were
really
to
do
it
if
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
climb
up
the
scaffolding
hilda
eagerly
do
you
think
he
will
solness
oh
one
can
never
tell
what
he
might
take
into
his
head
i
am
afraid
there
is
nothing
he
might
think
of
doing
hilda
aha
perhaps
you
too
think
he
is
well
solness
oh
i
do
know
what
to
think
about
him
now
the
doctor
has
been
telling
me
all
sorts
of
things
and
putting
it
all
together
with
several
things
i
have
heard
him
say
herdal
looks
out
at
the
door
herdal
is
he
not
coming
soon
solness
yes
i
think
so
i
have
sent
for
him
at
any
rate
herdal
advancing
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
go
in
my
dear
lady
solness
oh
no
oh
no
i
shall
stay
out
here
and
wait
for
halvard
herdal
but
some
ladies
have
just
come
to
call
on
you
solness
good
heavens
that
too
and
just
at
this
moment
herdal
they
say
they
positively
must
see
the
ceremony
solness
well
well
i
suppose
i
must
go
to
them
after
all
it
is
my
duty
hilda
ca
you
ask
the
ladies
to
go
away
solness
no
that
would
never
do
now
that
they
are
here
it
is
my
duty
to
see
them
but
do
you
stay
out
here
in
the
meantime
and
receive
him
when
he
comes
herdal
and
try
to
occupy
his
attention
as
long
as
possible
solness
yes
do
dear
miss
wangel
keep
as
firm
hold
of
him
as
ever
you
can
hilda
would
it
not
be
best
for
you
to
do
that
solness
yes
god
knows
that
is
my
duty
but
when
one
has
duties
in
so
many
directions
herdal
looks
towards
the
garden
there
he
is
coming
solness
and
i
have
to
go
in
herdal
to
hilda
do
say
anything
about
my
being
here
hilda
oh
no
i
daresay
i
shall
find
something
else
to
talk
to
solness
about
solness
and
be
sure
you
keep
firm
hold
of
him
i
believe
you
can
do
it
best
solness
and
herdal
go
into
the
house
hilda
remains
standing
on
the
verandah
solness
comes
from
the
garden
up
the
flight
of
steps
solness
somebody
wants
me
i
hear
hilda
yes
it
is
i
solness
solness
oh
is
it
you
hilda
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
aline
or
the
doctor
hilda
you
are
very
easily
frightened
it
seems
solness
do
you
think
so
hilda
yes
people
say
that
you
are
afraid
to
climb
about
on
the
scaffoldings
you
know
solness
well
that
is
quite
a
special
thing
hilda
then
it
is
true
that
you
are
afraid
to
do
it
solness
yes
i
am
hilda
afraid
of
falling
down
and
killing
yourself
solness
no
not
of
that
hilda
of
what
then
solness
i
am
afraid
of
retribution
hilda
hilda
of
retribution
shakes
her
head
i
do
understand
that
solness
sit
down
and
i
will
tell
you
something
hilda
yes
do
at
once
she
sits
on
a
stool
by
the
railing
and
looks
expectantly
at
him
solness
throws
his
hat
on
the
table
you
know
that
i
began
by
building
churches
hilda
nods
i
know
that
well
solness
for
you
see
i
came
as
a
boy
from
a
pious
home
in
the
country
and
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
the
noblest
task
i
could
set
myself
hilda
yes
yes
solness
and
i
venture
to
say
that
i
built
those
poor
little
churches
with
such
honest
and
warm
and
heartfelt
devotion
that
that
hilda
that
well
solness
well
that
i
think
that
he
ought
to
have
been
pleased
with
me
hilda
he
what
he
solness
he
who
was
to
have
the
churches
of
course
he
to
whose
honour
and
glory
they
were
dedicated
hilda
oh
indeed
but
are
you
certain
then
that
that
he
was
not
pleased
with
you
solness
scornfully
he
pleased
with
me
how
can
you
talk
so
hilda
he
who
gave
the
troll
in
me
leave
to
lord
it
just
as
it
pleased
he
who
bade
them
be
at
hand
to
serve
me
both
day
and
might
all
these
all
these
hilda
devils
solness
yes
of
both
kinds
oh
no
he
made
me
feel
clearly
enough
that
he
was
not
pleased
with
me
mysteriously
you
see
that
was
really
the
reason
why
he
made
the
old
house
burn
down
hilda
was
that
why
solness
yes
do
you
understand
he
wanted
to
give
me
the
chance
of
becoming
an
accomplished
master
in
my
own
sphere
so
that
i
might
build
all
the
more
glorious
churches
for
him
at
first
i
did
not
understand
what
he
was
driving
at
but
all
of
a
sudden
it
flashed
upon
me
hilda
when
was
that
solness
it
was
when
i
was
building
the
up
at
lysanger
hilda
i
thought
so
solness
for
you
see
hilda
up
there
amidst
those
new
surroundings
i
used
to
go
about
musing
and
pondering
within
myself
then
i
saw
plainly
why
he
had
taken
my
little
children
from
me
it
was
that
i
should
have
nothing
else
to
attach
myself
to
no
such
thing
as
love
and
happiness
you
understand
i
was
to
be
only
a
master
builder
nothing
else
and
all
my
life
long
i
was
to
go
on
building
for
him
laughs
but
i
can
tell
you
nothing
came
of
that
hilda
what
did
you
do
then
solness
first
of
all
i
searched
and
tried
my
own
heart
hilda
and
then
solness
the
i
did
the
impossible
i
no
less
than
he
hilda
the
impossible
solness
i
had
never
before
been
able
to
climb
up
to
a
great
free
height
but
that
day
i
did
it
hilda
leaping
up
yes
yes
you
did
solness
and
when
i
stood
there
high
over
everything
and
was
hanging
the
wreath
over
the
vane
i
said
to
him
hear
me
now
thou
mighty
one
from
this
day
forward
i
will
be
a
free
builder
i
too
in
my
sphere
just
as
thou
in
thine
i
will
never
more
build
churches
for
thee
only
homes
for
human
beings
hilda
with
great
sparkling
eyes
that
was
the
song
that
i
heard
through
the
air
solness
but
afterwards
his
turn
came
hilda
what
do
you
mean
by
that
solness
looks
despondently
at
her
building
homes
for
human
beings
is
not
worth
a
rap
hilda
hilda
do
you
say
that
now
solness
yes
for
now
i
see
it
men
have
no
use
for
these
homes
of
theirs
to
be
happy
in
and
i
should
not
have
had
any
use
for
such
a
home
if
i
had
had
one
with
a
quiet
bitter
laugh
see
that
is
the
upshot
of
the
whole
affair
however
far
back
i
look
nothing
really
built
nor
anything
sacrificed
for
the
chance
of
building
nothing
nothing
the
whole
is
nothing
hilda
then
you
will
never
build
anything
more
solness
with
animation
on
the
contrary
i
am
just
going
to
begin
hilda
what
then
what
will
you
build
tell
me
at
once
solness
i
believe
there
is
only
one
possible
for
human
happiness
and
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
build
now
hilda
looks
fixedly
at
him
solness
you
mean
our
castles
in
the
air
solness
the
castles
in
the
air
yes
hilda
i
am
afraid
you
would
turn
dizzy
before
we
got
up
solness
not
if
i
can
mount
hand
in
hand
with
you
hilda
hilda
with
an
expression
of
suppressed
resentment
only
with
me
will
there
be
no
others
of
the
party
solness
who
else
should
there
be
hilda
oh
that
girl
that
kaia
at
the
desk
poor
thing
do
you
want
to
take
her
with
you
too
solness
oho
was
it
about
her
that
aline
was
talking
to
you
hilda
is
it
so
or
is
it
not
solness
vehemently
i
will
not
answer
such
a
question
you
must
believe
in
me
wholly
and
entirely
hilda
all
these
ten
years
i
have
believed
in
you
so
utterly
so
utterly
solness
you
must
go
on
believing
in
me
hilda
then
let
me
see
you
stand
free
and
high
up
solness
sadly
oh
hilda
it
is
not
every
day
that
i
can
do
that
hilda
passionately
i
will
have
you
do
it
i
will
have
it
imploringly
just
once
more
solness
do
the
impossible
once
again
solness
stands
and
looks
deep
into
her
eyes
if
i
try
it
hilda
i
will
stand
up
there
and
talk
to
him
as
i
did
that
time
before
hilda
in
rising
excitement
what
will
you
say
to
him
solness
i
will
say
to
him
hear
me
mighty
lord
thou
judge
me
as
seems
best
to
thee
but
hereafter
i
will
build
nothing
but
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
world
hilda
carried
away
yes
yes
yes
solness
build
it
together
with
a
princess
whom
i
love
hilda
yes
tell
him
that
tell
him
that
solness
yes
and
then
i
will
say
to
him
now
i
shall
go
down
and
throw
my
arms
round
her
and
kiss
her
hilda
many
times
say
that
solness
many
many
times
i
will
say
it
hilda
and
then
solness
then
i
will
wave
my
hat
and
come
down
to
the
earth
and
do
as
i
said
to
him
hilda
with
outstretched
arms
now
i
see
you
again
as
i
did
when
there
was
song
in
the
air
solness
looks
at
here
with
his
head
bowed
how
have
you
become
what
you
are
hilda
hilda
how
have
you
made
me
what
i
am
solness
shortly
and
firmly
the
princess
shall
have
her
castle
hilda
jubilant
clapping
her
hands
oh
solness
my
lovely
lovely
castle
our
castle
in
the
air
solness
on
a
firm
foundation
in
the
street
a
crowd
of
people
has
assembled
vaguely
seen
through
the
trees
music
of

heard
far
away
behind
the
new
house

with
a
fur

her
white
shawl

his
arm

time

up
with
the
wreath

his
hat

will
go
down
to
him

must
be
down

the
men

below
solness

where
i
always
stand
on
everyday
occasions

goes
down
the
flight
of
steps
and
away
through
the
garden
solness
calls
after
him
over
the
railing
but
do
beg
the
man
to
be
careful
when
he
goes
up
promise
me
that
halvard
herdal
to
mrs
solness
do

see
that
i
was
right

given
up
all
thought
of
that
folly

a
relief

have
fallen
and
each
time
they
were
killed

the
spot

to
hilda
thank
you
miss
wangel
for

a
firm
hold
upon
him

should
never
have
been
able
to
manage
him
herdal
playfully
yes
yes
miss
wangel
you
know
how
to
keep
firm
hold
on
a
man
when
you
give
your
mind
to
it
solness
and
herdal
go
up
to
the
ladies
who
are
standing
nearer
to
the
steps
and
looking
over
the
garden
hilda
remains
standing
beside
the
railing
in
the
foreground
ragnar
goes
up
to
her
ragnar
with
suppressed
laughter
half
whispering
miss
wangel
do
you
see
all
those
young
fellows
down
in
the
street
hilda
yes
ragnar
they
are
my
fellow
students
come
to
look
at
the
master
hilda
what
do
they
want
to
look
at
him
for
ragnar
they
want
to
see
how
he
dare
climb
to
the
top
of
his
own
house
hilda
oh
that
is
what
those
boys
want
is
it
ragnar
spitefully
and
scornfully
he
has
kept
us
down
so
long
now
we
are
going
to
see
him
keep
quietly
down
below
himself
hilda
you
will
not
see
that
not
this
time
ragnar
smiles
indeed
then
where
shall
we
see
him
hilda
high
high
up
by
the
vane
that
is
where
you
will
see
him
ragnar
laughs
him
oh
yes
i
daresay
hilda
his
will
is
to
reach
the
top
so
at
the
top
you
shall
see
him
ragnar
his
will
yes
that
i
can
easily
believe
but
he
simply
can
not
do
it
his
head
would
swim
round
long
long
before
he
got
he
would
have
to
crawl
down
again
on
his
hands
and
knees
herdal
points
across
look
there
goes
the
foreman
up
the
ladders
solness
and
of
course
he
has
the
wreath
to
carry
too
oh
i
do
hope
he
will
be
careful
ragnar
stares
incredulously
and
shouts
why
but
it
hilda
breaking
out
in
jubilation
it
is
the
master
builder
himself
solness
screams
with
terror
yes
it
is
halvard
oh
my
great
god
halvard
halvard
herdal
hush
do
shout
to
him
solness
half
beside
herself
i
must
go
to
him
i
must
get
him
to
come
down
again
herdal
holds
her
do
move
any
of
you
not
a
sound
hilda
immovable
follows
solness
with
her
eyes
he
climbs
and
climbs
higher
and
higher
higher
and
higher
look
just
look
ragnar
breathless
he
must
turn
now
he
ca
possibly
help
it
hilda

climbs
and
climbs
he
will
soon
be
at
the
top
now
solness
oh
i
shall
die
of
terror
i
can
not
bear
to
see
it
herdal
then
do
look
up
at
him
hilda
there
he
is
standing
on
the
topmost
planks
right
at
the
top
herdal
nobody
must
move
do
you
dear
hilda
exulting
with
quiet
intensity
at
last
at
last
now
i
see
him
great
and
free
again
ragnar
almost
voiceless
but
this
is
im
hilda
so
i
have
seen
him
all
through
these
ten
years
how
secure
he
stands
frightfully
thrilling
all
the
same
look
at
him
now
he
is
hanging
the
wreath
round
the
vane
ragnar
i
feel
as
if
i
were
looking
at
something
utterly
impossible
hilda
yes
it
is
the
impossible
that
he
is
doing
now
with
the
indefinable
expression
in
her
eyes
can
you
see
any
one
else
up
there
with
him
ragnar
there
is
no
one
else
hilda
yes
there
is
one
he
is
striving
with
ragnar
you
are
mistaken
hilda
then
do
you
hear
no
song
in
the
air
either
ragnar
it
must
be
the
wind
in
the
hilda
hear
a
song
a
mighty
song
shouts
in
wild
jubilation
and
glee
look
look
now
he
is
waving
his
hat
he
is
waving
it
to
us
down
here
oh
wave
wave
back
to
him
for
now
it
is
finished
snatches
the
white
shawl
from
the
doctor
waves
it
and
shouts
up
to
solness
hurrah
for
master
builder
solness
herdal
stop
stop
for
god
sake
the
ladies
on
the
verandah
wave
their
and
the
shouts
of
hurrah
are
taken
up
in
the
street
then
they
are
suddenly
silenced
and
the
crowd
bursts
out
into
a
shriek
of
horror
a
human
body
with
planks
and
fragments
of
wood
is
vaguely
perceived
crashing
down
behind
the
trees
solness
and
the
ladies
at
the
same
time
he
is
falling
he
is
falling
solness
totters
falls
backwards
swooning
and
is
caught
amid
cries
and
confusion
by
the
ladies
the
crowd
in
the
street
breaks
down
the
fence
and
storms
into
the
garden
at
the
same
time
herdal
too
rushes
down
thither
a
short
pause
hilda
stares
fixedly
upwards
and
says
as
if
petrified
my
master
builder
ragnar
supports
himself
trembling
against
the
railing
he
must
be
dashed
to
pieces
killed
on
the
spot
one
of
the
ladies
whilst
solness
is
carried
into
the
house
run
down
for
the
doctor
ragnar
i
ca
stir
a
root
another
lady
then
call
to
some
one
ragnar
tries
to
call
out
how
is
it
is
he
alive
a
voice
below
in
the
garden
solness
is
dead
other
voices
nearer
the
head
is
all
he
fell
right
into
the
quarry
hilda
turns
to
ragnar
and
says
quietly
i
ca
see
him
up
there
now
ragnar
this
is
terrible
so
after
all
he
could
not
do
it
hilda
as
if
in
quiet
triumph
but
he
mounted
right
to
the
top
and
i
heard
harps
in
the
air
waves
her
shawl
in
the
air
and
shrieks
with
wild
intensity
my
my
master
builder
