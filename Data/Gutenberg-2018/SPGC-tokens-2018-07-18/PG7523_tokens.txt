my
dearest
mate
behold
a
soldier
on
the
eve
of
battle
i
am
writing
this
in
a
stuffy
little
hotel
room
and
i
do
dare
stop
whistling
for
a
minute
you
could
cover
my
courage
with
a
postage
stamp
in
the
morning
i
sail
for
the
flowery
kingdom
and
if
the
roses
are
waiting
to
strew
my
path
it
is
more
than
they
have
done
here
for
the
past
few
years
when
the
train
pulled
out
from
home
and
i
saw
that
crowd
of
loving
tearful
faces
fading
away
i
believe
that
for
a
few
moments
i
realized
the
actual
bitterness
of
death
i
was
leaving
everything
that
was
dear
to
me
on
earth
and
going
out
into
the
dark
unknown
alone
of
course
it
for
the
best
the
disagreeable
always
is
you
are
responsible
my
beloved
cousin
and
the
consequences
be
on
your
head
you
thought
my
salvation
lay
in
leaving
kentucky
and
seeking
my
fortune
in
strange
lands
your
tender
sensibilities
shrank
from
having
me
exposed
to
the
world
as
a
young
widow
who
is
not
sorry
so
you
shipped
me
east
of
suez
and
tied
me
up
with
a
four
years
contract
but
honor
bright
mate
i
do
believe
in
your
heart
you
can
blame
me
for
not
being
sorry
i
stuck
it
out
to
the
last
faced
neglect
humiliations
and
days
and
nights
of
anguish
almost
losing
my
in
my
effort
to
fulfil
my
duty
but
when
death
suddenly
put
an
end
to
it
all
god
alone
knows
what
a
relief
it
was
and
how
curiously
it
has
all
turned
out
first
my
taking
the
kindergarten
course
just
to
please
you
and
to
keep
my
mind
off
things
that
ought
not
to
have
been
then
my
sudden
release
from
bondage
and
the
dreadful
manner
of
it
my
awkward
position
my
dependence
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
this
sudden
offer
to
go
to
japan
and
teach
in
a
mission
school
is
it
ridiculous
mate
was
there
ever
anything
so
absurd
as
my
lot
being
cast
with
a
band
of
missionaries
i
who
have
never
missed
a
kentucky
derby
since
i
was
old
enough
to
know
a
bay
from
a
sorrel
i
guess
old
sister
fate
does
want
me
to
be
a
one
part
star
for
eighteen
years
i
played
pure
comedy
then
tragedy
for
seven
and
now
i
am
cast
for
a
character
part
nobody
will
ever
know
what
it
cost
me
to
come
all
of
them
were
so
terribly
opposed
to
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
spent
my
entire
life
going
against
the
wishes
of
my
family
yet
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
any
one
of
them
how
they
have
stood
by
me
and
loved
me
through
all
my
blind
blunders
i
back
my
mistakes
against
anybody
else
in
the
world
then
mate
there
was
jack
you
know
how
it
has
always
been
with
jack
when
i
was
a
little
girl
on
up
to
the
time
i
was
married
after
that
he
never
even
looked
it
but
just
stood
by
me
and
helped
me
like
a
brick
if
it
had
been
for
you
and
for
him
i
should
have
put
an
end
to
myself
long
ago
but
now
that
i
am
free
jack
has
begun
right
where
he
left
off
seven
years
ago
it
is
all
worse
than
useless
i
am
everlastingly
through
with
love
and
sentiment
of
course
we
all
know
that
jack
is
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
it
nearly
kills
me
to
give
him
pain
but
he
will
get
over
it
they
always
do
and
i
would
rather
for
him
to
convalesce
without
me
than
with
me
i
made
him
promise
not
to
write
me
a
line
and
he
just
looked
at
me
in
that
quiet
quizzical
way
and
said
all
right
but
you
just
remember
that
i
waiting
until
you
are
ready
to
begin
life
over
again
with
me
why
it
would
be
a
death
blow
to
all
his
hopes
if
he
married
me
my
widow
mite
consists
of
a
wrecked
life
a
few
debts
and
a
worldly
notion
that
a
brilliant
young
doctor
like
himself
has
no
right
to
throw
away
all
his
chances
in
order
to
establish
a
small
hospital
for
incurable
children
whenever
i
think
of
his
giving
up
that
dream
of
studying
in
germany
and
buying
ground
for
the
hospital
instead
i
just
gnash
my
teeth
oh
i
know
that
you
think
it
is
grand
and
noble
and
that
i
am
horrid
to
feel
as
i
do
maybe
i
am
at
any
rate
you
will
acknowledge
that
i
have
done
the
right
thing
for
once
in
coming
away
i
seem
to
have
been
a
general
blot
on
the
landscape
and
with
your
help
i
have
erased
myself
in
the
meanwhile
i
wish
to
heaven
my
heart
would
ossify
the
sole
power
that
keeps
me
going
now
is
your
belief
in
me
you
have
always
claimed
that
i
was
worth
something
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
have
persistently
proven
that
i
was
not
do
you
shudder
at
the
risk
you
are
taking
think
of
the
responsibility
of
standing
for
me
in
a
board
of
missions
i
stay
bottled
up
as
tight
as
i
know
how
but
suppose
the
cork
fly
poor
mate
the
lord
was
unkind
when
he
gave
me
to
you
for
a
cousin
well
it
done
and
by
the
time
you
get
this
i
will
probably
be
well
on
my
way
i
ca
trust
myself
to
send
any
messages
to
the
family
i
do
even
dare
send
my
love
to
you
i
am
a
soldier
lady
and
i
salute
my
officer
on
august
it
so
windy
that
i
can
scarcely
hold
the
paper
down
but
i
make
the
effort
the
first
night
i
came
aboard
i
had
everything
to
myself
there
were
eighty
cabin
passengers
and
i
was
the
only
lady
on
deck
it
was
very
rough
but
i
stayed
up
as
long
as
i
could
the
blue
devils
were
swarming
so
thick
around
me
that
i
did
want
to
fight
them
in
the
close
quarters
of
my
but
at
last
i
had
to
go
below
and
the
night
that
followed
was
a
terror
such
a
storm
raged
as
i
had
never
dreamed
of
the
ship
rocked
and
groaned
and
the
water
dashed
against
the
my
bag
played
tag
with
my
shoes
and
my
trunk
ran
around
the
room
like
a
rat
hunting
for
its
hole
overhead
the
shouts
of
the
captain
could
be
heard
above
the
answering
shouts
of
the
sailors
and
men
and
women
hurried
through
the
passage
through
it
all
i
lay
in
the
upper
berth
and
recalled
all
the
unhappy
nights
of
the
past
seven
years
disappointment
heartache
disillusionment
disgust
they
followed
each
other
in
silent
review
every
tender
memory
and
early
sentiment
that
might
have
lingered
in
my
heart
was
ruthlessly
murdered
by
some
stronger
memory
of
pain
the
storm
without
was
nothing
to
the
storm
within
i
felt
indifferent
as
to
the
fate
of
the
vessel
if
she
floated
or
if
she
sank
it
was
one
and
the
same
to
me
when
morning
came
something
had
happened
to
me
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
my
past
somehow
seemed
to
belong
to
someone
else
i
had
taken
a
last
farewell
of
all
the
old
burdens
and
i
was
a
new
person
in
a
new
world
i
put
on
my
prettiest
cap
and
my
long
coat
and
went
up
on
deck
oh
my
dear
if
you
could
only
have
seen
the
sight
that
greeted
me
it
was
the
limpest
sickest
crowd
i
ever
encountered
they
were
with
a
dash
of
yellow
and
a
streak
of
black
under
their
eyes
pale
around
the
lips
and
weak
in
their
knees
there
was
only
one
other
woman
besides
myself
who
was
not
sick
and
she
was
a
missionary
with
short
hair
and
a
big
nose
she
was
going
around
with
some
tracts
asking
everybody
if
they
were
christians
just
as
i
came
up
she
tackled
a
big
dejected
looking
foreigner
who
was
huddled
in
a
corner
brother
are
you
a
christian
no
no
he
muttered
impatiently
i
a
norwegian
now
what
that
man
needed
was
a
cocktail
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
suggest
it
at
table
i
am
in
a
corner
with
three
nice
old
gentlemen
and
one
young
german
they
are
great
on
and
i
told
all
of
mine
most
of
yours
and
some
i
invented
one
of
the
old
gentlemen
is
a
missionary
when
he
found
that
i
was
distantly
connected
with
the
fold
he
immediately
called
me
dear
sister
if
i
were
at
home
i
should
call
him
dear
pa
but
i
am
on
my
good
behavior
the
eating
is
fairly
good
only
sometimes
it
is
so
hot
with
curry
and
spice
that
it
nearly
takes
my
breath
my
little
chinese
waiter
is
entirely
too
solicitous
for
my
comfort
no
amount
of
argument
will
induce
him
to
leave
my
plate
until
i
have
finished
after
a
few
mouthfuls
he
whisks
it
away
and
brings
me
another
relay
after
pressing
upon
me
dishes
of
every
kind
he
insists
on
my
filling
up
all
crevices
with
nuts
and
raisins
and
after
i
have
eaten
and
eaten
he
looks
hurt
and
says
regretfully
missy
sickee
no
eatee
there
is
one
other
person
who
is
just
as
solicitous
the
little
german
watches
my
every
mouthful
with
round
solemn
eyes
and
insists
upon
serving
everything
to
me
he
looks
bewildered
when
anyone
tells
a
funny
story
and
sometimes
asks
for
an
explanation
he
has
been
around
the
world
twice
and
is
now
going
to
china
for
three
years
for
the
society
of
scientific
research
he
seems
to
think
i
am
the
greatest
curio
he
has
yet
encountered
in
his
travels
the
chief
excitement
of
our
trip
so
far
has
been
the
day
in
honolulu
i
wanted
to
sing
for
joy
when
we
sighted
land
the
trees
and
grass
never
looked
so
beautiful
as
they
did
that
morning
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
it
took
us
hours
to
land
on
account
of
the
red
tape
that
had
to
be
unwound
and
then
there
was
an
extra
delay
of
which
i
was
the
innocent
cause
the
quarantine
doctor
was
inspecting
the
ship
and
after
i
had
watched
him
examine
the
emigrants
and
had
gotten
my
feelings
wrought
up
over
the
poor
miserable
little
children
swarming
below
i
found
a
nice
quiet
nook
on
the
shelter
deck
where
i
snuggled
down
and
amused
myself
watching
the
native
boys
swim
the
water
on
their
bronze
bodies
made
them
shine
in
the
sunlight
and
they
played
about
like
a
shoal
of
young
porpoises
i
must
have
stayed
there
an
hour
for
when
i
came
down
there
was
considerable
stir
on
board
a
passenger
was
missing
and
we
were
being
held
while
a
search
of
the
ship
was
made
i
was
getting
most
excited
when
the
purser
who
is
the
sternest
and
best
looking
man
you
ever
saw
came
up
and
pounced
upon
me
have
you
been
inspected
he
demanded
eyeing
me
from
head
to
foot
not
any
more
than
at
present
i
answered
meekly
come
with
me
he
said
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
throw
me
overboard
but
he
was
too
full
of
importance
to
smile
he
handed
me
over
to
the
doctor
saying
here
is
the
young
woman
that
caused
the
delay
young
woman
indeed
but
i
was
to
be
crushed
yet
further
for
the
doctor
looked
over
his
glasses
and
said
now
how
did
we
miss
that
but
on
to
honolulu
i
do
wonder
people
go
wild
over
it
it
is
as
if
all
the
artists
in
all
the
world
had
spilled
their
colors
over
one
spot
and
nature
had
sorted
them
out
at
her
own
sweet
will
i
kept
wondering
if
i
had
died
and
gone
to
heaven
marvelous
palms
and
tropical
plants
and
all
hanging
in
a
softly
dreaming
silence
that
went
to
my
head
like
wine
i
started
out
to
see
the
city
with
two
old
ladies
and
a
girl
from
south
dakota
but
dear
pa
and
little
germany
joined
the
party
oh
mate
how
i
longed
for
you
i
wanted
to
tie
all
those
frousy
old
freaks
up
in
a
hard
knot
and
pitch
them
into
the
sea
the
girl
from
south
dakota
is
a
little
better
than
the
rest
but
she
wears
a
jersey
there
real
people
on
board
but
i
do
dare
associate
with
them
they
play
bridge
most
of
the
time
and
if
i
hesitated
near
them
i
be
lost
i
play
my
part
never
fear
but
i
hereby
swear
that
i
will
not
dress
it
still
on
board
august
dear
mate
i
am
writing
this
in
my
berth
with
the
curtains
drawn
no
i
am
not
a
bit
just
popular
one
of
the
old
ladies
is
teaching
me
to
knit
the
missionary
reads
aloud
to
me
the
girl
from
south
dakota
keeps
my
feet
covered
up
and
dear
pa
and
little
germany
assist
me
to
eat
the
captain
has
had
a
big
bathing
tank
rigged
up
for
the
ladies
and
i
take
a
cold
plunge
every
morning
it
makes
me
think
of
our
old
days
at
the
cottage
up
at
the
cape
did
we
have
a
royal
time
that
summer
and
were
we
young
and
foolish
it
was
the
last
good
time
i
had
for
many
a
long
day
but
there
none
of
that
last
night
i
had
an
adventure
at
least
it
was
next
door
to
one
i
was
sitting
up
on
deck
when
dear
pa
came
by
and
asked
me
to
walk
with
him
after
several
rounds
we
sat
down
on
the
pilot
house
steps
the
moon
was
as
big
as
a
wagon
wheel
and
the
whole
sea
flooded
with
silver
while
the
flying
fishes
played
hide
and
seek
in
the
shadows
i
forgot
all
about
dear
pa
and
was
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
on
my
own
account
when
he
leaned
over
and
said
i
hope
you
do
mind
talking
to
me
i
am
very
very
lonely
now
i
thought
i
recognized
a
grave
symptom
and
when
he
began
to
tell
me
about
his
dear
departed
i
knew
it
was
time
to
be
going
you
have
passed
through
it
he
said
you
can
sympathize
i
crossed
my
fingers
in
the
dark
we
are
both
seeking
a
life
work
in
a
foreign
field
he
began
again
but
just
here
the
purser
passed
he
almost
stumbled
over
us
in
the
dark
and
when
he
saw
me
and
my
elderly
friend
he
actually
smiled
do
you
dare
tell
jack
about
this
i
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
can
you
realize
that
i
am
three
whole
weeks
from
home
i
do
every
second
of
it
sometimes
when
i
stop
to
think
what
i
am
doing
my
heart
almost
bursts
but
then
i
am
so
used
to
the
heartache
that
i
might
be
lonesome
without
it
who
knows
if
i
can
only
do
what
is
expected
of
me
if
i
can
only
pick
up
the
pieces
of
this
life
of
mine
and
patch
them
into
a
decent
whole
that
you
will
not
be
ashamed
of
then
i
will
be
content
the
first
foreign
word
i
have
learned
is
alohaoe
i
think
it
means
my
dearest
love
to
you
any
how
i
send
it
laden
with
the
tenderest
meaning
god
bless
and
keep
you
all
and
bring
me
back
to
you
a
wiser
and
a
gladder
woman
kobe
august
actually
in
japan
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
even
with
all
this
strange
life
going
on
about
me
this
morning
a
launch
came
out
to
the
steamer
bringing
miss
lessing
and
miss
dixon
the
two
missionaries
in
whose
school
i
am
to
work
when
i
saw
them
i
must
confess
that
my
heart
went
down
in
my
boots
theirs
must
have
done
the
same
thing
for
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
as
awkwardly
as
if
we
belonged
to
different
planets
the
difference
began
with
our
heels
and
extended
right
on
up
to
the
crown
of
our
hats
even
the
language
we
spoke
seemed
different
and
when
i
faced
the
prospect
of
living
with
such
utter
strangers
i
wanted
to
jump
overboard
my
fellow
passengers
suddenly
became
very
dear
i
clung
to
everything
about
that
old
steamer
as
the
last
link
that
bound
me
to
america
as
we
came
down
the
gang
plank
i
was
introduced
to
brother
mason
and
brother
white
and
we
all
came
ashore
together
i
felt
for
all
the
world
like
a
convict
sentenced
to
four
years
in
the
penitentiary
when
we
reached
the
hotel
i
fled
to
my
room
and
flung
myself
on
the
bed
i
knew
i
might
as
well
have
it
out
i
cried
for
two
hours
and
minutes
then
i
got
up
and
washed
my
face
and
looked
out
of
the
window
it
was
all
so
strange
and
picturesque
that
i
got
interested
before
i
knew
it
by
and
by
miss
lessing
came
in
now
that
her
hat
was
off
i
saw
that
she
had
a
very
sweet
face
with
pretty
dark
hair
and
a
funny
little
twinkle
behind
her
eyes
that
made
me
think
of
you
she
told
me
how
she
had
come
out
to
japan
when
she
was
a
young
girl
and
how
she
had
built
up
the
school
and
all
she
longed
to
do
for
it
then
she
said
your
coming
seems
like
the
direct
answer
to
prayer
it
has
been
one
of
my
dearest
dreams
to
have
a
kindergarten
for
the
little
ones
it
just
seems
too
good
to
be
true
and
she
looked
at
me
out
of
her
nice
shining
eyes
with
such
gratitude
and
enthusiasm
that
i
was
ashamed
of
what
i
had
felt
after
that
miss
dixon
came
up
and
they
sat
and
watched
me
unpack
my
trunk
it
took
me
about
two
minutes
to
find
out
that
they
were
just
like
other
women
fond
of
finery
and
pretty
things
and
eager
for
news
of
the
outside
world
they
examined
all
the
dainty
under
clothes
that
sister
had
made
for
me
they
marvelled
over
the
high
heeled
slippers
and
laughed
at
the
big
sleeves
where
are
you
going
to
wear
all
these
lovely
things
asked
miss
dixon
and
again
my
heart
sank
for
even
my
simple
wardrobe
planned
for
the
exigencies
of
school
life
seemed
strangely
extravagant
and
out
of
place
but
i
want
to
say
right
now
mate
that
if
i
stay
here
a
thousand
years
i
never
come
to
jerseys
and
hats
i
am
going
to
subscribe
to
a
good
fashion
paper
and
at
least
keep
within
hailing
distance
of
the
styles
it
is
too
warm
to
go
down
to
the
school
yet
so
we
are
to
spend
a
week
in
the
mountains
before
we
start
in
for
the
fall
term
dear
pa
and
little
germany
have
been
here
twice
in
three
hours
but
i
saw
them
first
home
letters
will
not
arrive
until
next
week
and
i
can
scarcely
wait
for
the
time
to
come
i
keep
thinking
that
i
am
away
on
a
visit
and
that
i
will
be
going
back
soon
i
find
myself
saving
things
to
show
you
and
even
starting
to
buy
things
to
bring
home
i
have
a
good
deal
to
learn
have
i
hieisan
august
real
true
that
we
used
to
talk
about
up
in
the
old
at
grandmother
it
all
so
mate
only
more
bewitching
than
we
ever
dreamed
i
have
been
in
little
villages
that
dropped
right
out
of
a
picture
book
the
streets
are
full
of
queer
small
people
who
run
about
smiling
and
bowing
and
saying
pretty
things
to
each
other
it
is
a
land
where
everybody
seems
to
be
happy
and
where
politeness
is
the
first
commandment
yesterday
we
came
up
the
mountains
in
jinrikishas
the
road
was
narrow
but
smooth
and
for
over
three
hours
the
men
trotted
along
never
halting
or
changing
their
gait
until
we
stopped
for
lunch
there
is
not
much
to
a
japanese
house
but
a
roof
and
a
lot
of
bamboo
poles
but
everything
is
beautifully
clean
before
we
had
gotten
down
several
men
and
women
came
running
out
and
bowing
and
calling
ohayo
ohayo
which
means
they
ran
for
cushions
and
we
were
glad
enough
to
sit
on
the
low
benches
and
stretch
ourselves
then
they
brought
us
delicious
tea
and
gathered
around
to
see
us
drink
it
it
seems
that
light
hair
is
a
great
curiosity
over
here
and
mine
proved
so
interesting
that
they
motioned
for
me
to
take
off
my
hat
and
then
they
stood
around
chattering
and
laughing
at
a
great
rate
miss
lessing
said
they
wanted
me
to
take
my
hair
down
but
would
not
ask
it
because
of
the
beautiful
arrangement
shades
of
blondes
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
it
but
you
seen
it
after
a
hard
set
of
tennis
when
we
had
rested
an
hour
and
drunk
tea
and
bowed
and
smiled
we
started
out
again
this
time
in
a
kind
of
sedan
chair
made
of
bamboo
and
carried
on
a
long
pole
on
the
shoulders
of
two
men
now
i
have
been
up
steep
places
but
that
trip
beat
anything
i
ever
saw
i
felt
like
a
fly
on
a
bald
man
head
we
climbed
up
up
up
sometimes
through
woods
that
were
so
dense
you
could
scarcely
know
it
was
and
again
through
stretches
of
dazzling
sunshine
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
our
luggage
we
passed
four
women
laughing
and
singing
two
of
them
had
steamer
trunks
on
their
heads
and
two
carried
huge
kori
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
and
bowed
and
smiled
us
out
of
sight
another
two
hours
climb
brought
us
to
this
village
of
camps
called
hieisan
there
are
about
forty
americans
here
who
are
camping
out
for
the
summer
and
i
am
the
guest
of
a
waring
and
his
wife
from
alabama
my
tent
is
high
above
everything
on
a
great
overhanging
rock
and
before
me
is
a
view
that
would
be
a
fit
setting
for
paradise
this
mountain
is
sacred
to
buddha
and
the
whole
of
it
is
thick
with
temples
and
shrines
some
of
them
nobody
knows
how
old
i
have
been
trying
to
muster
courage
to
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning
to
see
the
monkeys
come
out
for
breakfast
the
mountains
are
full
of
them
but
they
are
only
to
be
seen
at
that
hour
there
are
some
very
pleasant
people
here
and
i
have
made
a
number
of
friends
i
am
something
of
a
conundrum
and
curiosity
is
rife
as
to
i
came
waring
dresses
me
up
and
shows
me
off
like
a
new
doll
and
the
women
consult
me
about
making
over
their
clothes
i
do
know
why
i
am
not
perfectly
miserable
the
truth
is
mate
i
am
having
a
good
time
it
nice
to
be
petted
and
treated
like
a
child
it
is
good
to
be
among
plain
honest
people
that
live
out
doors
and
have
healthy
bodies
and
minds
i
want
to
forget
all
that
i
learned
about
the
world
in
the
past
seven
years
i
want
to
begin
life
again
as
a
girl
with
a
few
illusions
even
if
they
are
borrowed
ones
i
know
too
much
for
my
years
and
determined
to
forget
the
home
letters
were
heavenly
i
read
them
limber
i
answer
the
rest
hiroshima
at
last
after
my
wanderings
i
am
settled
for
the
winter
the
school
is
a
big
structure
open
and
airy
and
i
have
a
nice
room
facing
the
east
where
you
dear
ones
are
on
two
sides
tower
the
mountains
and
between
them
lies
the
magical
inland
sea
this
is
a
great
naval
and
military
station
and
while
i
write
i
can
hear
the
bugle
calls
from
the
parade
grounds
i
have
a
pretty
little
maid
to
wait
on
me
and
i
wish
you
could
see
us
talking
to
each
other
she
comes
in
bows
until
her
head
touches
the
floor
and
hopes
that
my
honorable
ears
and
eyes
and
teeth
are
well
i
tell
her
in
plain
english
that
i
am
feeling
bully
then
we
both
laugh
she
is
delighted
with
all
my
things
and
touches
them
softly
saying
over
and
over
it
mine
to
care
for
there
are
between
four
and
five
hundred
girls
in
the
school
and
until
i
get
more
familiar
with
the
language
i
am
to
work
with
the
older
girls
who
understand
some
english
you
would
smile
to
see
their
curiosity
concerning
me
they
think
my
waist
is
very
funny
and
they
measure
it
with
their
hands
and
laugh
aloud
one
girl
asked
me
in
all
seriousness
why
i
had
had
pieces
cut
out
of
my
sides
and
another
wanted
to
know
if
my
hair
used
to
be
black
you
see
in
all
this
big
city
i
am
the
only
person
with
golden
tresses
and
a
green
carnation
would
not
excite
more
comment
yesterday
we
went
shopping
to
get
some
curtains
for
my
room
such
a
crowd
followed
us
that
we
could
scarcely
see
what
we
were
doing
when
we
went
into
the
stores
we
sat
on
the
floor
and
a
little
boy
fanned
us
all
the
time
we
were
making
our
selection
monday
miss
lessing
asked
me
to
begin
a
physical
culture
class
with
the
larger
girls
who
are
being
trained
for
teachers
so
i
decided
that
the
first
lesson
would
be
on
it
is
an
unknown
art
in
japan
and
the
lack
of
it
makes
the
kindergarten
work
very
awkward
i
took
fourteen
girls
out
on
the
porch
and
told
them
by
signs
and
gestures
to
follow
me
then
i
picked
up
my
skirts
and
whistling
a
started
off
you
never
saw
anything
to
equal
their
look
of
absolute
astonishment
they
even
got
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
to
watch
my
feet
but
they
were
game
and
in
spite
of
their
tight
kimonos
and
sandalled
feet
they
made
a
brave
effort
to
follow
the
first
attempt
was
disastrous
some
fell
on
their
faces
some
went
down
on
their
knees
and
all
stumbled
i
did
dare
laugh
for
the
japanese
can
stand
anything
better
than
ridicule
i
helped
and
encouraged
and
cheered
them
on
to
victory
the
next
day
there
was
a
slight
improvement
and
by
the
third
day
they
were
experts
i
found
that
they
had
spent
the
whole
afternoon
in
practice
now
what
do
you
suppose
the
result
is
an
epidemic
of
skipping
has
swept
over
hiroshima
like
the
measles
men
women
and
children
are
trying
to
learn
and
when
we
go
out
to
walk
i
almost
have
convulsions
at
the
elderly
couples
we
pass
earnestly
trying
to
catch
the
step
i
was
so
encouraged
by
this
success
that
i
taught
the
girls
all
sorts
of
steps
and
figures
even
going
so
far
as
to
teach
them
the
but
my
ambition
led
me
a
little
too
far
one
day
i
came
to
class
with
a
brand
new
step
which
i
had
invented
myself
it
rather
giddy
but
a
splendid
exercise
well
i
headed
the
line
and
after
the
girls
had
followed
me
around
the
room
twice
i
saw
that
they
were
convulsed
with
laughter
when
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
they
explained
between
gasps
that
the
step
was
the
principal
movement
in
the
heathen
dance
given
during
festivals
to
the
god
of
beauty
my
saints
would
some
of
my
dear
brethren
do
a
turn
if
they
knew
every
afternoon
i
take
about
forty
of
the
girls
out
for
a
walk
our
favorite
stroll
is
along
the
moat
that
surrounds
the
old
castle
it
is
almost
always
spilling
over
with
lotus
blossoms
the
maidens
trotting
demurely
along
in
their
kimonos
and
little
clicking
sandals
make
a
pretty
picture
we
have
to
pass
the
parade
grounds
of
the
barracks
where
soldiers
are
stationed
and
i
do
wish
you
could
see
them
trying
to
be
modest
and
yet
peeping
out
of
the
corners
of
their
little
almond
eyes
in
a
way
which
is
not
peculiar
to
any
particular
country
and
the
way
they
imitate
me
makes
me
afraid
to
breathe
naturally
this
thing
of
being
a
shining
example
is
more
than
i
bargained
for
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
in
my
checkered
career
that
i
have
hitherto
escaped
never
mind
mate
i
could
be
frivolous
if
i
wanted
to
down
here
kobe
would
have
proven
fatal
for
there
are
many
foreigners
there
and
the
temptation
to
have
a
good
time
would
have
been
too
much
for
me
i
am
rapidly
developing
into
a
sister
and
the
world
and
the
flesh
and
the
devil
are
shut
up
in
the
closet
let
us
pray
october
at
last
dear
mate
i
am
started
at
my
own
work
with
the
babies
and
there
are
any
words
to
tell
you
how
cunning
they
are
there
are
high
class
children
in
the
pay
kindergarten
and
forty
in
the
free
the
latter
are
mostly
of
the
very
poor
families
most
of
the
mothers
working
in
the
fields
or
on
the
railroads
there
are
so
many
pitiful
cases
that
one
longs
for
a
mint
of
money
and
a
dozen
hands
to
relieve
them
one
little
girl
of
six
comes
every
day
with
her
blind
baby
brother
strapped
on
her
back
she
is
a
tiny
thing
herself
and
yet
that
baby
is
never
unstrapped
from
her
back
until
night
comes
when
i
first
saw
her
old
weazened
face
and
her
eagerness
to
play
i
just
took
them
both
in
my
lap
and
cried
one
funny
thing
i
must
tell
you
about
from
the
first
week
that
i
got
here
the
children
have
had
a
nickname
for
me
i
noticed
them
laughing
and
nudging
each
other
on
the
street
and
in
the
school
and
whenever
i
passed
they
raised
their
right
hands
in
salute
and
gave
a
funny
little
clucking
sound
they
seemed
to
pass
the
word
from
one
to
another
until
every
youngster
in
the
neighborhood
followed
the
trick
my
curiosity
was
aroused
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
got
an
interpreter
to
investigate
the
matter
when
he
came
to
report
he
smilingly
touched
my
little
enamelled
watch
the
one
jack
gave
me
on
my
birthday
and
apologetically
informed
me
that
the
children
thought
it
was
a
decoration
from
the
emperor
and
they
were
saluting
me
in
consequence
and
they
have
named
me
the
lady
of
the
decoration
think
of
it
i
have
a
title
and
i
am
actually
looked
up
to
by
these
funny
yellow
babies
as
a
superior
being
they
forget
it
some
time
though
when
we
all
get
to
playing
together
in
the
yard
we
ca
talk
to
each
other
but
we
can
laugh
and
romp
together
and
sometimes
the
fun
runs
high
i
am
busy
from
morning
until
night
the
two
kindergartens
a
big
training
class
in
physical
culture
two
japanese
lessons
a
day
and
prayers
about
every
three
minutes
do
leave
many
spare
hours
for
homesickness
but
the
longing
is
there
all
the
same
and
when
i
see
the
big
steamers
out
in
the
harbor
and
realize
that
they
are
coaling
for
i
just
want
to
steal
aboard
and
stay
there
the
language
is
something
awful
i
get
my
tongue
in
such
knots
that
i
have
to
use
a
corkscrew
to
pull
it
straight
again
just
between
you
and
me
i
have
decided
to
give
it
up
and
devote
my
time
to
teaching
the
girls
to
speak
english
instead
they
are
such
responsive
eager
little
things
it
will
not
be
hard
as
for
the
country
i
would
dare
to
attempt
a
description
sometimes
i
just
with
the
beauty
of
it
all
from
my
window
i
can
see
in
one
group
banana
pomegranate
persimmon
and
fig
trees
all
loaded
with
fruit
the
roses
are
still
in
full
bloom
and
color
color
everywhere
across
the
river
the
banks
are
lined
with
picturesque
houses
that
look
out
from
a
mass
of
green
and
above
them
are
and
temples
and
shrines
so
old
that
even
the
moss
is
gray
and
time
has
worn
away
the
dates
engraved
upon
the
stones
we
spent
yesterday
at
the
sacred
island
of
miyajima
which
is
about
one
hour
ride
from
here
the
dream
of
it
is
still
upon
me
and
i
wish
i
could
share
it
with
you
we
went
over
in
a
sampan
a
rude
open
boat
rowed
by
two
men
in
undress
uniform
for
half
an
hour
we
literally
danced
across
the
sea
everything
was
fresh
and
sparkling
and
i
was
so
glad
to
be
alive
and
free
that
i
just
sang
for
joy
miss
leasing
joined
in
and
the
boatmen
kept
time
smiling
and
nodding
their
approval
the
mountains
were
sky
high
and
at
their
base
in
a
small
plain
was
the
village
with
streets
so
clean
and
white
you
hated
to
walk
on
them
we
stopped
at
the
house
of
the
white
cloud
and
three
little
maids
took
off
our
shoes
and
replaced
them
with
pretty
sandals
the
whole
house
was
of
cedar
and
ebony
and
bamboo
and
it
had
been
rubbed
with
oil
until
it
shone
like
satin
on
the
floor
was
a
stuffed
matting
with
a
heavy
border
of
crimson
silk
and
in
the
corner
of
the
room
was
a
jar
that
came
to
my
shoulder
full
of
wonderfully
blended
chrysanthemums
all
the
rooms
opened
upon
a
porch
which
hung
directly
above
a
roaring
waterfall
and
below
us
a
dozen
steps
away
stretched
the
sparkling
sea
full
of
hundreds
of
sailing
vessels
and
junks
in
the
afternoon
we
wandered
over
the
island
visiting
the
old
old
temples
listening
to
the
mysterious
wailing
of
the
wind
bells
feeding
the
deer
and
crane
and
drinking
in
the
beauty
of
it
all
i
felt
like
a
disembodied
spirit
traveling
back
back
over
the
centuries
into
dim
forgotten
ages
the
dead
seemed
close
about
me
yet
they
brought
no
gloom
for
i
too
was
dead
all
afternoon
i
had
the
impression
of
trying
to
keep
my
consciousness
from
drifting
into
oblivion
through
the
gate
of
this
magical
dream
how
you
would
enjoy
it
all
and
read
its
deeper
meaning
which
is
hidden
from
me
but
even
if
i
ca
philosophize
like
a
certain
blessed
old
mate
of
mine
i
can
until
every
nerve
is
a
tingle
with
the
thrill
good
bye
for
a
little
while
i
stolen
the
time
to
write
you
this
and
now
it
behooves
me
to
hustle
november
it
been
a
long
while
between
drinks
but
i
have
been
waiting
until
i
could
write
a
letter
minus
the
groans
the
truth
is
i
have
hit
bottom
good
and
hard
and
it
is
only
that
i
have
come
to
the
surface
when
the
exhilaration
of
seeing
all
the
new
and
strange
sights
wore
off
i
began
to
sink
in
a
sea
of
homesickness
that
threatened
to
put
an
end
to
the
kindergarten
business
for
good
and
all
i
worked
like
mad
and
all
the
time
i
felt
like
one
of
these
whizzing
rockets
that
go
rushing
through
the
air
and
die
out
in
a
miserable
little
fizzle
at
the
end
i
can
stand
it
in
the
daytime
but
at
night
i
almost
go
crazy
and
you
have
no
idea
how
many
women
do
lose
their
minds
out
here
nearly
every
year
some
poor
insane
creature
has
to
be
shipped
home
you
need
worry
about
that
though
if
i
had
mind
enough
to
lose
i
have
lost
it
long
ago
but
to
think
of
all
my
old
ambitions
and
aspirations
ending
in
the
humble
task
of
wiping
little
japan
nose
i
suppose
you
think
i
am
pulling
for
the
shore
but
i
am
not
i
am
steering
my
little
craft
right
out
in
the
billows
it
may
be
dashed
to
smithereens
and
it
may
come
safely
home
again
but
in
any
case
have
the
consolation
of
the
texas
cowboy
that
i
done
my
durndest
by
the
way
what
has
become
of
jack
he
need
have
taken
me
so
literally
as
never
to
send
me
a
message
even
you
mentioned
his
having
been
at
the
cape
while
you
were
there
was
he
just
as
unsociable
as
ever
i
can
see
him
now
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
the
bottom
of
a
boat
reading
poetry
i
hate
poetry
and
when
he
used
to
quote
his
favorite
passages
i
made
parodies
on
them
now
were
always
different
you
rhapsodize
with
him
to
his
heart
content
just
here
i
had
a
lovely
surprise
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
a
coolie
pull
a
little
wagon
into
the
yard
and
begin
to
unload
i
could
imagine
what
was
taking
place
but
pretty
soon
miss
dixon
came
in
with
both
arms
full
of
papers
pictures
magazines
and
letters
it
was
all
my
mail
i
just
danced
up
and
down
for
joy
i
guess
you
will
never
know
the
meaning
of
letters
until
you
are
nine
thousand
miles
from
home
and
such
dear
loving
encouraging
letters
as
mine
were
i
am
going
to
sit
right
down
and
read
them
all
over
again
november
clear
sailing
once
more
mate
in
my
last
i
remember
i
was
blowing
the
fog
horn
pretty
persistently
the
letters
from
home
set
me
straight
again
if
ever
a
human
being
was
blessed
with
a
good
family
and
good
friends
it
is
my
unworthy
self
the
past
week
has
been
unusually
exciting
first
we
had
a
wedding
on
hand
the
bride
is
a
girl
who
has
been
educated
in
the
school
so
of
course
we
were
all
interested
some
time
ago
the
who
does
all
the
arranging
came
to
her
father
and
said
a
young
teacher
in
the
government
school
desired
his
daughter
in
marriage
the
father
without
consulting
the
girl
investigated
the
suitor
standing
and
finding
it
satisfactory
said
yea
so
little
otoya
was
told
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
and
the
groom
elect
was
invited
to
call
i
was
on
tiptoe
with
curiosity
to
see
what
would
happen
but
the
meeting
took
place
behind
closed
doors
otoya
told
me
afterwards
that
she
had
never
seen
the
young
man
until
he
entered
the
room
but
they
both
bowed
three
times
then
she
served
tea
while
her
mother
and
father
talked
to
him
did
you
talk
to
him
at
all
i
asked
she
looked
horrified
no
that
would
have
been
most
immodest
she
said
but
you
peeped
at
him
i
insisted
she
shook
her
head
that
would
have
been
disgrace
now
that
was
three
months
ago
and
she
had
seen
him
until
monday
when
they
were
married
at
our
suggestion
they
decided
to
have
an
american
wedding
and
i
was
appointed
mistress
of
ceremonies
it
was
great
fun
for
we
had
a
best
man
besides
and
flower
girls
and
miss
lessing
played
the
wedding
march
for
them
to
enter
the
arrangements
were
somewhat
difficult
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
japanese
consider
it
the
height
of
vulgarity
to
discuss
anything
pertaining
to
the
bride
or
the
wedding
they
excused
me
on
the
ground
that
i
was
a
foreigner
the
affair
was
really
beautiful
the
little
bride
outer
garment
was
the
finest
black
crepe
but
under
it
layer
after
layer
were
slips
of
rainbow
tinted
silk
that
rippled
into
sight
with
every
movement
she
made
and
every
inch
of
her
trousseau
was
made
from
the
cocoons
of
worms
raised
in
her
own
house
and
was
spun
into
silk
by
her
waiting
maids
after
the
excitement
of
the
wedding
had
subsided
we
had
a
visitation
from
forty
chinese
peers
they
came
in
a
cavalcade
of
kuramas
gorgeously
arrayed
and
presenting
an
imposing
appearance
i
ran
for
the
poker
for
i
thought
maybe
they
had
come
to
finish
us
missionaries
but
bless
you
they
had
heard
of
our
school
and
our
kindergarten
and
had
come
for
the
chinese
government
to
investigate
ways
and
means
they
made
a
tour
of
the
school
ending
up
in
the
kindergarten
the
children
were
completely
overpowered
by
these
gentlemen
but
i
put
them
through
their
paces
the
visitors
were
so
pleased
that
they
stayed
all
morning
and
signified
their
unqualified
approval
when
they
started
to
leave
i
asked
the
interpreter
if
their
gracious
highnesses
would
permit
my
unworthy
self
to
take
their
honorable
pictures
would
you
believe
it
those
old
fellows
puffed
up
like
pouter
pigeons
and
giggled
and
primped
like
a
lot
of
school
girls
they
stood
in
a
row
and
beamed
upon
me
while
i
snapped
the
kodak
if
the
picture
is
good
i
send
you
one
this
morning
i
had
to
teach
sunday
school
i
be
praying
in
public
next
i
see
it
coming
the
lesson
was
the
prodigal
son
a
subject
on
which
i
ought
to
be
qualified
to
speak
the
japanese
youths
understood
about
one
word
out
of
three
but
they
were
giving
me
close
attention
i
was
expounding
with
all
the
earnestness
in
me
when
suddenly
i
remembered
a
picture
jack
used
to
have
it
was
of
a
lean
little
calf
tearing
down
the
road
while
in
the
distance
was
coming
a
lazy
looking
tramp
underneath
was
the
legend
run
bossy
run
here
comes
the
prodigal
son
that
settled
my
sermon
so
i
told
the
boys
a
bear
story
instead
how
i
should
love
to
drop
in
on
you
and
sit
on
the
floor
before
the
fire
and
i
be
an
awful
back
number
when
i
come
home
but
just
think
how
entertaining
i
be
i
have
enough
good
dinner
stories
to
last
through
the
rest
of
my
life
for
heaven
sake
send
me
some
hat
pins
nice
long
ones
with
pretty
heads
and
if
you
are
in
new
york
this
winter
please
get
me
two
bottles
of
that
violet
extract
that
i
always
use
my
dearest
love
to
all
and
a
hundred
kisses
to
the
blessed
children
at
home
do
you
let
them
forget
me
november
i
told
you
it
would
come
my
prophetic
soul
foresaw
it
i
had
to
lead
the
prayer
in
chapel
this
morning
and
i
play
the
organ
in
sunday
school
and
listen
to
two
japanese
sermons
on
sunday
i
tell
you
mate
this
part
of
the
work
goes
sadly
against
the
grain
they
say
you
get
used
to
hanging
if
you
just
hang
long
enough
so
i
suppose
i
become
reconciled
in
time
you
ask
me
i
do
these
things
well
you
see
it
all
just
like
a
big
work
shop
where
everybody
is
working
hard
and
cheerfully
and
yet
there
is
so
much
work
waiting
to
be
done
that
you
do
stop
to
ask
whether
you
like
it
or
not
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
of
the
hopelessness
of
some
of
the
lives
out
here
just
think
of
it
women
working
in
the
stone
quarries
and
in
the
sand
pits
and
on
the
railroads
and
always
with
babies
tied
on
their
backs
and
the
poor
little
tots
crippled
and
deformed
from
the
cramped
position
and
often
blind
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
what
i
am
crazy
to
do
now
is
to
open
another
free
kindergarten
in
one
of
the
poorest
parts
of
the
city
it
would
cost
only
fifty
dollars
to
run
it
a
whole
year
and
i
mean
to
do
it
if
i
have
to
sell
one
of
my
rings
it
is
just
glorious
to
feel
that
you
are
actually
helping
somebody
even
if
that
somebody
is
a
small
and
dirty
tribe
of
japanese
children
i
get
so
discouraged
and
blue
sometimes
that
i
do
know
what
to
do
but
when
a
little
tot
comes
up
and
slips
a
very
soiled
hand
into
mine
and
pats
it
and
lays
it
against
his
cheek
and
hugs
it
up
to
his
breast
and
says
sensei
sensei
i
just
long
to
take
the
whole
lot
of
them
to
my
heart
and
love
them
into
an
education
they
do
know
the
word
love
but
they
know
its
meaning
and
if
i
happen
to
stop
to
pat
a
little
head
a
dozen
arms
are
around
me
in
a
minute
and
i
am
almost
suffocated
with
affection
one
little
fellow
always
calls
me
nice
boy
because
that
is
what
i
called
him
we
are
having
glorious
weather
cold
in
doors
but
warm
outside
the
chrysanthemums
and
roses
are
still
blooming
and
the
trees
are
heavily
laden
with
fruit
the
persimmons
grow
bigger
than
a
coffee
cup
and
the
oranges
are
tiny
things
but
both
are
delicious
chestnuts
are
twice
as
big
as
ours
and
they
cook
them
as
a
vegetable
you
be
having
thanksgiving
soon
and
you
will
all
go
up
to
grandmother
and
have
a
jolly
time
together
have
them
fix
a
plate
for
me
mate
and
turn
down
an
empty
glass
nobody
will
miss
me
as
much
as
i
will
miss
my
poor
little
self
what
jolly
thanksgivings
we
have
had
together
the
gathering
of
the
clans
the
big
dinner
and
the
play
at
night
not
exactly
a
play
was
it
mate
f
more
of
a
vaudeville
performance
with
you
as
the
stage
manager
and
i
as
the
soubrette
do
you
remember
the
last
reunion
before
i
was
married
i
mean
the
time
i
was
lady
macbeth
and
gave
a
skirt
dance
and
you
did
lovely
stunts
from
grand
opera
have
you
forgotten
jack
famous
parody
on
my
country
is
of
thee
my
turkey
is
of
thee
sweet
bird
of
cranberry
of
thee
i
sing
i
love
thy
neck
and
wings
legs
back
and
other
things
etc
etc
there
goes
the
bell
and
here
go
i
can
appreciate
the
feelings
of
a
fire
engine
christmas
day
had
somebody
told
you
last
christmas
as
we
trimmed
the
big
tree
and
made
ready
for
the
family
gathering
that
this
christmas
would
find
me
in
a
foreign
country
teaching
a
band
of
little
heathens
would
you
have
thought
somebody
had
wheels
in
his
head
and
yet
it
is
true
and
i
have
only
to
lift
my
eyes
to
realize
fully
that
i
am
really
in
the
flowery
kingdom
the
plum
blossoms
are
in
full
bloom
and
the
roses
too
while
a
thick
frost
makes
everything
sparkling
white
in
the
sunshine
the
mountains
have
put
on
a
thin
blue
veil
trimmed
in
silver
and
over
all
is
a
turquoise
sky
and
best
of
all
everybody
i
speak
figuratively
is
happy
it
may
be
that
some
poor
little
waif
is
hungry
having
had
only
rice
water
for
breakfast
it
may
be
some
sad
hearts
are
beating
under
the
gay
kimonos
and
it
be
mate
dear
that
somebody
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
ca
keep
the
tears
back
and
is
longing
with
all
her
mind
and
soul
and
body
for
home
and
her
loved
ones
but
never
you
mind
nobody
knows
it
but
you
and
me
and
a
bamboo
tree
this
afternoon
we
are
going
to
have
tea
for
the
mammas
and
papas
and
i
am
going
to
put
on
my
prettiest
clothes
and
do
my
yellow
locks
in
their
most
fetching
style
i
shall
lock
up
tight
way
down
deep
all
heartaches
and
longings
and
put
on
my
best
smile
for
these
dear
little
people
who
have
given
to
me
a
stranger
such
full
measure
of
their
sympathy
and
friendship
who
in
the
big
service
last
month
when
giving
thanks
for
all
the
great
blessings
of
the
past
year
named
the
new
kindergarten
teacher
first
do
you
wonder
that
i
am
happy
and
miserable
and
homesick
and
contented
all
at
the
same
time
the
box
i
sent
home
for
christmas
was
a
paltry
offering
compared
to
what
i
wanted
to
send
but
the
things
were
bought
with
the
first
money
i
ever
earned
they
are
packed
in
so
tight
with
love
that
i
doubt
if
you
ever
get
them
out
our
christmas
dinner
was
not
exactly
a
success
we
invited
all
the
foreigners
in
hiroshima
twelve
in
number
and
everybody
talked
a
great
deal
and
laughed
at
everybody
stale
jokes
and
pretended
to
be
terribly
hilarious
but
there
was
a
pathetic
droop
to
every
mouth
and
not
a
soul
referred
to
each
one
seemed
to
realize
that
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
would
break
up
the
party
i
tell
you
i
am
beginning
to
look
with
positive
reverence
on
the
heroism
of
some
of
these
people
tears
and
regrets
have
no
place
here
desire
ambition
love
itself
is
laid
aside
and
only
taken
out
for
inspection
perhaps
in
the
dead
hours
of
the
night
if
heart
breaks
come
as
come
they
must
there
is
no
crying
out
no
rebellion
just
a
stiffer
lip
and
a
firmer
grip
and
the
work
goes
on
i
wish
i
was
like
that
but
i
not
if
nature
had
put
more
time
on
my
head
and
less
on
my
heart
she
would
have
turned
out
a
better
job
i
put
a
pipe
in
the
box
for
jack
if
you
think
i
ought
not
to
have
done
it
do
give
it
to
him
as
old
charity
used
to
say
i
want
to
discomboberate
nobody
only
i
hope
he
wo
think
i
am
ungrateful
and
indifferent
nagasaki
january
now
are
you
surprised
at
hearing
from
me
in
nagasaki
i
am
certainly
surprised
at
being
here
one
of
the
teachers
at
the
school
miss
dixon
was
taken
sick
and
had
to
come
here
to
see
a
doctor
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
asked
to
come
with
her
i
am
so
excited
over
being
in
touch
with
civilization
again
that
i
ca
sleep
at
night
the
transports
and
all
the
steamers
stop
here
and
every
type
of
humanity
seems
to
be
represented
this
morning
when
i
went
out
to
mail
a
letter
there
were
two
sikhs
in
uniform
in
front
of
me
at
my
side
was
a
russian
behind
me
two
chinamen
and
a
japanese
while
a
frenchman
stepped
aside
for
me
to
pass
and
an
irishman
tried
to
sell
me
some
vegetables
miss
dixon
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
for
a
few
days
though
her
trouble
is
nothing
serious
and
i
accepted
an
invitation
from
ferris
the
wife
of
the
american
consul
to
spend
a
few
days
with
her
and
oh
mate
if
you
only
the
time
i
have
had
if
i
were
a
sort
of
i
would
quote
jack
and
say
it
has
been
perfectly
damn
gorgeously
if
you
want
to
really
enjoy
the
just
live
away
from
them
for
six
months
and
then
try
them
the
night
i
came
the
ferrises
gave
me
a
beautiful
dinner
and
i
wore
evening
dress
for
the
first
time
in
two
years
and
was
as
thrilled
as
a
debutante
at
her
first
ball
it
was
so
good
to
see
cut
glass
and
silver
and
to
hear
dear
silly
worldly
chatter
that
i
grew
terribly
frivolous
plates
were
laid
for
twenty
and
who
do
you
suppose
was
on
my
right
the
severe
young
purser
who
was
on
the
steamer
i
came
over
in
his
ship
is
coaling
in
the
harbour
and
he
is
staying
with
the
ferrises
who
are
old
friends
of
his
he
is
so
solemn
that
he
almost
kills
me
if
he
were
so
good
looking
i
could
let
him
alone
but
as
it
is
i
ca
help
worrying
the
life
out
of
him
the
dinner
was
most
elaborate
after
the
oysters
came
a
fish
nearly
three
feet
long
all
done
up
in
then
a
big
silver
bowl
was
brought
in
covered
with
when
the
carver
broke
the
crust
there
was
a
flutter
of
wings
and
four
and
twenty
black
birds
flew
out
this
it
seems
was
done
by
the
japanese
cook
as
a
sample
of
his
skill
all
sorts
of
queer
courses
followed
served
in
the
most
unique
manner
possible
after
dinner
they
begged
me
to
sing
and
though
i
protested
violently
they
got
me
down
at
the
piano
i
did
get
up
any
more
until
the
party
was
over
for
they
made
me
sing
every
song
i
knew
and
some
i
did
i
sang
some
things
so
hoary
with
age
that
they
were
decrepit
the
purser
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
ask
me
to
sing
my
bonnie
lies
over
the
ocean
i
did
so
with
great
expression
while
he
looked
pensively
into
the
fire
since
then
i
have
called
him
my
bonnie
and
he
me
the
next
day
we
went
out
to
services
on
board
the
battleship
victor
the
ship
had
been
on
a
long
cruise
and
we
were
the
first
american
women
the
officers
had
seen
for
many
a
long
day
they
gave
us
a
rousing
welcome
you
may
be
sure
through
some
mistake
they
thought
i
was
a
miss
instead
of
a
and
i
shamelessly
let
it
pass
during
service
i
heard
little
that
was
said
for
the
band
was
playing
outside
and
flags
were
flying
and
i
was
feeling
frivolous
to
the
tip
of
my
toe
i
guess
i
am
still
pretty
young
for
brass
buttons
are
just
as
alluring
as
of
old
when
the
admiral
heard
i
was
from
kentucky
he
invited
us
to
take
tiffin
with
him
and
we
exchanged
darkey
stories
and
the
old
gentleman
nearly
burst
his
buttons
laughing
after
tea
he
showed
us
over
the
ship
making
the
sailors
line
up
on
deck
for
our
benefit
tell
the
band
to
play
kentucky
home
he
ordered
you
lose
a
passenger
if
you
do
i
cried
for
one
note
of
that
would
send
me
overboard
he
was
so
attentive
that
i
had
little
chance
to
talk
to
the
young
officers
i
met
but
several
of
them
have
called
since
and
i
have
been
out
to
a
lot
of
teas
and
dinners
and
things
with
them
the
one
i
like
best
is
a
young
fellow
from
vermont
he
is
very
clever
and
jolly
and
we
have
great
fun
together
in
fact
we
are
such
chums
that
he
showed
me
a
picture
of
his
fiancée
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
her
but
if
i
were
in
her
place
i
would
try
to
keep
him
within
we
will
probably
go
home
as
miss
dixon
is
so
much
better
i
am
glad
she
is
better
but
i
could
have
been
reconciled
to
her
being
mildly
indisposed
for
a
few
days
longer
i
forgot
to
thank
you
for
the
kodak
book
you
sent
christmas
between
the
joy
of
seeing
all
the
familiar
faces
and
the
bitterness
of
the
separation
and
the
absurdity
of
your
jingles
i
nearly
had
hysterics
i
almost
felt
as
if
i
had
had
a
visit
home
the
old
house
the
cabin
the
cherry
tree
and
all
the
family
even
down
to
old
black
charity
the
very
sight
of
whom
made
me
hungry
for
buckwheat
cakes
all
all
gave
me
such
joy
and
pain
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
was
uppermost
it
worth
everything
to
be
loved
as
you
all
love
me
and
i
am
willing
to
go
through
anything
to
be
worthy
of
it
i
have
had
more
than
my
share
of
hard
bumps
in
life
but
thank
heaven
there
was
always
somebody
waiting
to
kiss
the
place
to
make
it
well
there
is
a
day
that
i
have
some
evidence
of
this
love
a
letter
a
paper
a
book
that
reminds
me
that
i
not
forgotten
a
note
has
just
come
from
his
solemn
highness
the
purser
asking
me
to
go
walking
with
him
i
am
going
to
try
to
be
nice
to
him
but
i
know
i
wo
he
is
so
young
and
so
serious
that
i
ca
resist
shocking
him
he
does
approve
of
giddy
young
widows
that
do
look
sorry
neither
do
i
in
two
days
i
return
to
the
fold
until
then
my
bonnie
beware
hiroshima
february
after
a
sleepless
night
i
got
up
this
morning
with
a
splitting
headache
i
have
been
back
in
the
traces
for
a
month
and
i
am
beginning
to
feel
like
a
poor
old
horse
in
a
tread
mill
not
that
i
do
love
the
work
but
oh
mate
i
am
so
lonesome
lonesome
lonesome
i
think
i
used
up
so
much
sand
when
i
first
came
that
the
supply
is
running
low
all
day
there
is
the
watchful
world
to
face
the
sound
of
tears
and
laughter
fill
the
air
for
memory
there
is
but
scanty
space
nor
time
for
any
transport
of
despair
but
love
the
pulse
beats
slow
the
lips
turn
white
sometimes
at
night
perhaps
when
i
am
old
and
gray
and
wrinkled
i
be
at
peace
but
think
of
the
years
in
between
i
have
been
cheated
of
the
best
that
life
holds
for
a
woman
the
love
of
a
good
husband
the
love
of
her
children
and
the
joys
of
a
home
the
old
world
shakes
its
finger
and
says
you
did
it
yourself
but
mate
i
was
only
eighteen
and
i
did
know
the
real
from
the
false
i
staked
my
all
for
the
prize
of
love
and
i
lost
heaven
knows
i
paid
the
penalty
but
i
do
it
over
again
if
i
thought
i
was
right
the
difference
is
that
then
i
was
a
child
and
knew
too
little
and
now
i
am
a
woman
and
know
too
much
sometimes
the
and
praying
and
sistering
and
brothering
get
on
my
nerves
until
i
almost
scream
but
when
i
remember
how
heavenly
good
to
me
they
are
i
all
contrition
i
have
even
been
invited
to
write
for
the
mission
papers
now
is
that
sufficient
glory
for
any
sinner
your
letters
are
such
comforts
to
me
i
read
them
over
and
over
and
actually
know
parts
of
them
by
heart
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
have
had
a
burning
desire
to
win
your
approval
i
remember
once
when
you
said
i
was
stronger
than
the
little
boy
next
door
i
sprained
my
back
trying
to
prove
it
and
now
when
you
write
those
lovely
things
about
me
and
tell
me
how
good
and
brave
i
am
why
i
sprain
something
worse
than
my
back
to
be
worthy
of
your
approval
but
my
courage
does
always
ring
true
mate
sometimes
it
a
brass
ring
if
you
want
to
hear
of
true
heroism
just
listen
to
this
story
there
was
a
little
american
missionary
who
was
going
home
to
stay
after
twenty
years
of
hard
service
at
the
request
of
the
board
she
stopped
off
at
the
leper
colony
in
order
to
make
a
report
soon
after
she
reached
home
she
discovered
a
small
white
spot
on
her
hand
and
on
consulting
a
physician
found
it
was
leprosy
without
breathing
a
word
of
it
to
anyone
she
bade
her
family
and
friends
a
cheerful
and
came
straight
back
to
that
leper
colony
where
she
took
up
her
work
among
the
outcasts
never
an
outcry
never
a
groan
not
even
a
plea
for
sympathy
now
how
is
that
for
a
soldier
lady
it
is
quite
cold
and
i
am
indulging
in
the
luxury
of
a
roaring
fire
you
know
the
natives
use
little
stoves
that
they
carry
around
with
them
and
call
hibachi
but
cold
as
it
is
the
yard
is
full
of
roses
and
the
are
gorgeous
i
do
wonder
that
the
climate
gets
mixed
out
here
everything
else
is
hind
part
before
what
do
you
suppose
i
been
longing
for
all
day
a
good
saddle
horse
i
feel
that
a
brisk
canter
would
set
me
straight
in
a
short
time
but
the
only
horse
in
hiroshima
is
a
mule
a
old
mule
that
bitterly
resents
the
insult
of
being
hitched
to
something
that
is
a
cross
between
a
wheelbarrow
and
a
baby
buggy
the
driver
stands
up
for
the
excellent
reason
that
he
has
no
place
to
sit
down
we
tried
this
coupé
once
for
the
fun
and
experience
we
got
the
experience
all
right
but
i
am
not
so
sure
about
the
fun
we
jolted
along
through
the
narrow
streets
scraping
first
against
one
house
then
against
another
while
our
footman
oh
yes
we
had
a
footman
ran
beside
the
thoroughbred
to
help
him
up
when
he
stumbled
we
are
to
have
company
a
salvation
army
lassie
comes
down
from
tokio
with
a
brass
band
it
is
the
second
time
in
the
history
of
the
town
that
the
people
have
had
a
chance
to
hear
a
brass
band
and
they
are
greatly
thrilled
i
must
say
i
am
a
bit
excited
myself
miss
lessing
says
she
is
going
to
keep
me
in
sight
for
fear
i
will
follow
the
drum
away
she
need
worry
i
am
through
following
anything
in
this
world
but
my
own
nose
hiroshima
march
i
am
absolutely
walking
on
air
today
just
when
i
thought
my
cherished
dream
of
a
free
kindergarten
would
have
to
be
given
up
the
checks
from
home
came
you
were
a
trump
to
get
them
all
interested
and
it
was
beautiful
the
way
they
responded
only
did
you
tell
jack
he
ought
to
have
sent
so
much
i
send
it
back
if
i
were
afraid
of
hurting
him
my
head
is
simply
spinning
with
plans
we
are
going
to
open
the
school
right
away
and
there
are
hundreds
of
things
to
be
done
in
spite
of
my
and
loneliness
and
longing
for
you
loved
ones
i
would
come
home
now
if
i
could
it
is
the
feeling
that
i
am
needed
here
that
a
big
work
will
go
undone
if
i
do
do
it
that
simply
puts
my
little
wants
and
desires
right
out
of
the
question
yesterday
we
had
a
mothers
meeting
and
i
have
not
stopped
laughing
over
it
yet
it
seems
that
the
mothers
considered
it
proper
to
show
their
appreciation
by
absolute
solemnity
after
tea
and
cake
were
served
they
sat
in
funeral
silence
not
a
word
nor
a
smile
could
we
get
out
of
them
when
i
could
stand
it
another
minute
i
told
miss
lessing
i
was
going
to
break
the
ice
if
i
went
under
in
the
effort
by
means
of
an
interpreter
i
told
the
mothers
that
we
were
going
to
try
an
american
amusement
and
would
they
lend
their
honorable
assistance
then
i
called
in
thirty
of
the
school
girls
and
told
each
one
to
ask
a
mother
to
skip
they
were
too
polite
to
decline
so
to
the
tune
of
johnson
turn
me
loose
the
procession
started
miss
dixon
could
stay
in
the
room
for
laughing
the
old
and
the
young
and
the
fat
and
the
thin
caught
the
spirit
of
it
and
went
hopping
and
jumping
around
the
circle
in
great
glee
after
that
old
ladies
and
all
played
pussy
wants
a
corner
and
drop
the
handkerchief
and
they
laughed
and
chattered
like
a
lot
of
children
they
stayed
four
hours
and
we
are
still
picking
up
hair
ornaments
up
over
my
table
i
have
the
little
picture
you
sent
of
the
lane
that
turned
at
last
you
always
said
my
lane
would
turn
and
it
turned
into
a
broad
road
bordered
by
and
wistaria
but
mate
you
need
think
there
are
no
more
mudholes
for
there
are
when
i
see
them
ahead
i
climb
the
fence
and
walk
around
i
am
getting
quite
thrilled
these
days
over
the
prospect
of
war
the
soldiers
are
drilling
by
the
hundreds
and
the
bugles
are
blowing
all
day
it
makes
little
thrills
run
up
and
down
my
back
but
miss
lessing
says
nothing
will
come
of
it
that
japan
is
always
getting
ready
for
a
scrap
but
the
railway
has
refused
all
freight
because
it
is
too
busy
bringing
soldiers
and
supplies
to
vladivostock
now
speaking
of
vladivostock
reminds
me
of
a
plan
that
has
been
suggested
for
next
summer
miss
dixon
the
teacher
who
was
sick
is
going
to
russia
and
is
crazy
for
me
to
go
with
her
it
would
be
much
more
expensive
than
staying
in
japan
and
would
be
tremendously
interesting
do
mention
it
to
anybody
at
home
but
write
me
if
you
approve
i
wish
you
could
have
peeped
into
my
room
last
night
four
or
five
of
the
girls
slipped
in
after
the
silence
bell
had
rung
and
we
sat
around
the
fire
on
the
floor
and
drank
tea
while
i
showed
them
my
photographs
they
made
such
a
pretty
picture
with
their
gay
gowns
and
red
cheeks
and
they
were
so
thrilled
over
all
my
things
the
pictures
from
home
interested
them
most
of
all
especially
the
one
of
you
and
jack
which
i
have
framed
together
at
first
they
thought
you
must
be
married
and
when
i
said
no
they
decided
that
you
were
lovers
so
i
let
it
go
after
they
went
to
bed
i
sat
and
looked
at
the
two
pictures
in
the
double
frame
and
wondered
how
it
was
after
all
that
you
and
jack
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
you
both
live
with
your
heads
in
the
clouds
i
should
think
you
would
have
bumped
into
each
other
long
before
this
he
told
me
once
that
you
had
fewer
faults
than
any
woman
he
had
ever
known
telling
me
of
other
people
virtues
was
one
of
jack
long
suits
my
last
minute
of
grace
is
gone
so
i
must
say
i
am
getting
up
at
five
these
mornings
in
order
to
get
in
all
that
i
want
to
do
hiroshima
may
under
promise
that
i
will
not
write
a
long
letter
i
am
allowed
to
begin
one
to
you
this
morning
miss
lessing
wrote
you
last
week
that
i
had
been
sick
the
truth
is
i
tried
to
do
too
much
and
paid
up
for
it
by
staying
in
bed
two
whole
weeks
perhaps
i
will
acquire
a
little
sense
in
the
next
world
i
certainly
have
in
this
japan
made
for
restless
energetic
people
if
you
ca
learn
to
be
lazy
you
ca
last
long
i
can
never
tell
you
how
good
miss
lessing
has
been
sleeping
right
by
me
taking
care
of
me
and
loving
me
like
i
was
her
own
child
the
girls
too
have
been
so
good
sending
me
gifts
almost
every
hour
in
the
day
one
little
girl
got
up
at
prayers
the
other
night
and
folding
her
hands
said
oh
lord
please
make
the
skipping
sensei
well
and
help
me
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
so
it
will
be
quiet
for
she
has
been
good
to
us
and
we
all
do
love
her
much
heaven
knows
the
skipping
sensei
needs
all
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
just
as
soon
as
school
is
over
miss
dixon
and
i
start
for
russia
it
a
good
thing
that
vacation
is
near
for
i
am
tired
of
being
a
missionary
lady
and
a
in
fact
i
am
tired
of
being
good
do
worry
about
me
for
i
am
all
right
i
just
run
down
and
need
a
little
fun
to
wind
me
up
for
another
year
kobe
july
does
july
mean
anything
to
you
it
does
to
me
just
one
year
ago
today
the
gates
of
that
old
union
depot
shut
between
me
and
all
that
was
dear
to
me
and
i
went
out
into
the
big
world
to
fight
my
big
fight
alone
well
i
am
still
fighting
mate
and
probably
will
be
to
the
end
of
the
campaign
as
you
see
i
am
in
kobe
waiting
for
my
to
go
to
russia
if
there
is
anything
you
want
to
know
about
just
apply
to
me
with
all
confidence
i
sailed
down
to
the
consulate
and
was
met
by
a
pair
of
legs
attached
to
a
huge
mustache
and
the
funniest
little
button
of
a
head
you
ever
saw
i
think
the
lord
must
have
laughed
when
he
got
through
making
that
man
he
was
horribly
bored
with
life
in
general
and
me
in
particular
he
motioned
me
wearily
to
a
chair
beside
a
table
and
handing
me
a
paper
managed
to
sigh
fill
in
the
questions
were
about
like
this
who
was
your
father
what
are
you
doing
out
of
your
own
country
was
anybody
in
your
family
ever
hung
how
many
teeth
have
you
i
wrote
rapidly
until
i
got
to
when
were
you
born
was
standing
by
me
so
i
looked
up
at
him
helplessly
and
told
him
that
was
one
thing
i
could
remember
he
said
i
would
have
to
and
i
said
i
could
he
pranced
around
for
fifteen
minutes
and
i
pretended
to
be
racking
my
brain
then
he
handed
me
a
bible
and
said
in
a
stern
voice
swear
i
told
him
that
i
could
that
i
never
had
sworn
that
ladies
did
do
it
in
america
would
he
please
do
it
for
me
about
this
time
miss
dixon
spoiled
the
fun
by
laughing
so
i
had
to
behave
after
we
had
spent
two
hours
and
three
dollars
in
that
dingy
old
office
we
departed
but
our
troubles
were
not
over
no
sooner
had
we
reached
the
hotel
than
appeared
with
more
papers
you
failed
to
describe
yourself
he
mournfully
announced
handing
me
another
slip
i
had
not
had
my
dinner
and
i
was
cross
but
i
seized
a
pen
determined
to
make
short
work
of
it
how
tall
easily
told
black
or
white
very
easy
kind
of
chin
round
and
rosy
shape
of
face
depends
on
time
and
place
hair
pure
gold
eyes
now
i
knew
they
were
green
but
that
did
not
sound
poetic
enough
so
i
appealed
to
dixie
she
thought
for
a
while
then
said
not
gray
nor
brown
i
have
it
they
are
syrup
colored
so
i
put
it
down
along
with
a
lot
of
other
nonsense
now
the
papers
have
to
be
sent
to
tokyo
for
approval
then
back
here
again
where
i
will
have
to
do
some
more
signing
and
swearing
this
enough
to
discourage
people
from
ever
going
anywhere
the
news
about
the
sailboat
is
great
how
many
of
you
will
be
up
at
the
cape
this
summer
is
jack
going
when
i
think
of
the
starlight
nights
out
in
the
boat
and
the
long
lazy
mornings
on
the
beach
i
get
absolutely
faint
with
longing
heretofore
i
have
to
enjoy
things
and
now
when
i
might
i
am
an
exile
heading
for
siberia
oh
well
perhaps
there
will
be
starlight
nights
in
siberia
who
knows
vladivostock
siberia
august
if
i
should
write
all
i
wanted
to
say
this
morning
my
letter
would
reach
across
the
pacific
i
did
believe
it
was
possible
for
me
ever
to
have
such
a
good
time
again
when
we
came
we
brought
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
heath
she
has
a
beautiful
big
house
and
a
beautiful
big
heart
and
she
took
us
right
into
both
the
day
after
we
arrived
i
was
standing
on
her
piazza
looking
down
the
bay
when
i
saw
a
come
sailing
in
under
a
salute
of
seventeen
guns
from
the
fort
it
turned
out
to
be
the
victor
and
you
never
knew
such
rejoicing
heath
knows
all
the
navy
people
and
her
house
is
a
favorite
rendezvous
before
night
we
had
met
many
old
acquaintances
among
them
my
nagasaki
friend
vermont
it
has
been
tremendously
jolly
and
i
ca
deny
that
i
have
been
outrageously
frivolous
for
a
missionary
but
to
save
my
life
i
conjure
up
the
ghost
of
a
regret
and
what
is
more
i
have
been
contaminating
dixie
i
have
kept
her
in
such
a
giddy
whirl
that
she
says
i
have
paralysed
her
conscience
i
have
dressed
her
up
and
trotted
her
along
to
lunches
teas
and
dinners
to
concerts
on
sea
and
land
and
once
oh
awful
confession
i
bulldozed
her
into
going
to
the
theatre
the
consequence
is
that
she
has
gotten
entirely
well
and
looks
ten
years
younger
her
chief
trouble
was
that
she
had
surrounded
herself
with
a
regular
picket
fence
of
creed
and
dogma
and
was
afraid
to
lift
her
eyes
for
fear
she
would
catch
a
glimpse
through
the
cracks
of
the
beautiful
world
which
god
meant
for
us
to
enjoy
it
gave
me
particular
joy
to
pull
a
few
palings
off
that
picket
fence
most
of
my
time
is
spent
on
the
water
with
vermont
i
do
find
it
half
bad
out
on
the
bewitching
uzzuri
bay
when
the
moon
is
shining
and
the
music
floats
over
the
water
to
discuss
love
with
a
fascinating
youth
what
does
it
matter
if
he
is
talking
about
the
other
one
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
glad
to
know
that
somewhere
in
this
wide
world
there
a
man
that
can
be
loyal
to
his
sweetheart
even
though
she
is
ten
thousand
miles
away
i
ask
occasional
questions
and
do
listen
to
the
answers
and
he
pours
out
his
confessions
and
thinks
i
am
lovely
he
really
is
one
of
the
dearest
fellows
i
ever
met
and
i
am
glad
for
that
other
girl
with
all
my
heart
i
like
several
of
the
other
men
very
much
but
they
bother
me
with
questions
they
refuse
to
believe
that
i
am
connected
with
a
mission
and
consider
it
all
as
a
huge
joke
i
wish
you
could
see
this
place
it
is
built
in
terraces
up
the
greenest
of
mountains
and
forms
a
crescent
around
the
bay
everybody
seems
to
be
in
uniform
of
some
kind
and
soldiers
and
sailors
are
at
every
turn
the
streets
are
a
glittering
panorama
of
strange
color
and
form
at
night
everything
is
ablaze
bands
playing
uniforms
glittering
and
flags
flying
it
is
all
just
one
intense
thrill
of
life
and
rhythm
and
the
cloven
foot
of
my
worldliness
never
fails
to
keep
time
but
when
daylight
comes
and
all
the
sordid
ugliness
is
revealed
disgust
takes
the
place
of
fascination
the
streets
are
crowded
with
thousands
of
degraded
chinese
and
koreans
who
even
in
their
brutality
are
not
as
bad
as
the
ordinary
russians
through
this
mass
of
poverty
and
degradation
dash
handsome
carriages
filled
with
richly
clad
people
the
drivers
wear
long
blue
plush
blouses
with
red
sleeves
and
belt
and
trousers
tucked
in
high
boots
on
their
heads
they
wear
funny
little
hats
that
look
as
if
they
had
been
sat
on
they
generally
stand
up
while
driving
and
lash
the
poor
horses
into
a
dead
run
from
start
to
finish
many
of
them
are
and
can
never
leave
siberia
if
their
cruelty
to
horses
is
any
criterion
of
their
cruelty
to
their
fellow
men
i
ca
help
thinking
they
deserve
their
punishment
i
wo
dare
to
mail
this
letter
until
i
get
out
of
russia
for
they
are
so
cranky
about
their
blessed
old
country
they
would
not
even
let
me
have
a
little
flag
to
send
to
the
boys
at
home
i
found
out
that
a
policeman
comes
every
day
to
see
what
we
have
been
doing
what
hours
we
keep
etc
in
fact
every
movement
is
watched
and
one
day
when
we
returned
to
the
hotel
we
found
that
all
our
possessions
had
been
searched
and
the
police
had
even
left
their
old
cigar
stumps
among
our
things
the
more
you
see
of
russia
the
more
deeply
you
fall
in
love
with
uncle
sam
several
days
ago
heath
gave
us
a
and
we
had
a
jolly
time
the
tea
was
served
under
the
trees
from
a
steaming
samovar
around
which
gathered
representatives
of
many
nations
there
were
many
unpronounceable
gentlemen
and
one
real
english
lord
who
considered
americans
frightfully
amusing
i
thought
i
had
forgotten
how
to
play
tennis
but
i
had
that
undercut
that
jack
taught
us
won
me
a
reputation
it
is
only
when
i
stop
to
think
that
i
realize
how
far
i
am
from
home
when
i
wonder
where
you
all
are
this
minute
and
what
you
are
doing
i
feel
as
if
i
were
on
a
visit
to
the
planet
mars
and
had
no
communication
whatever
with
the
world
think
of
me
mate
in
siberia
eating
fish
with
a
spoon
and
drinking
coffee
from
a
glass
verily
when
old
sister
fate
found
she
could
not
down
me
she
must
have
decided
to
play
pranks
with
me
my
box
of
new
clothes
arrived
just
before
i
started
and
i
have
had
use
for
everything
when
i
get
on
the
white
coat
suit
and
the
white
hat
i
feel
like
a
dream
the
weather
is
simply
glorious
like
our
best
october
days
at
home
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
than
russia
and
japan
one
is
a
great
oil
painting
tragic
majestic
grand
while
the
other
is
an
exquisitely
dainty
water
color
full
of
sunshine
and
flowers
callers
have
come
so
i
must
close
life
is
a
very
pretty
game
after
all
especially
when
you
get
wise
enough
to
look
on
vladivostock
siberia
september
just
a
short
letter
to
tell
you
that
we
leave
vladivostock
i
am
all
broken
up
it
has
been
the
happiest
summer
that
i
have
had
for
years
and
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
being
over
it
has
been
so
long
since
peace
and
i
have
been
acquainted
that
i
hardly
yet
dare
look
her
full
in
the
face
for
fear
she
will
take
flight
and
leave
me
in
utter
darkness
again
even
if
she
has
not
come
to
live
with
me
she
is
at
least
my
next
door
neighbor
and
i
offer
her
incense
that
she
may
abide
now
i
might
as
well
confess
that
if
it
were
not
for
memory
there
is
no
telling
what
peace
might
do
poor
old
memory
i
like
to
throttle
her
sometime
and
bury
her
in
a
deep
hole
yet
she
has
served
me
many
a
good
turn
and
often
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
impulse
and
thought
but
she
is
like
a
poor
relation
always
turning
up
at
the
wrong
time
for
instance
on
a
gorgeous
moonlight
night
on
the
uzzuri
bay
when
you
are
out
in
a
sampan
with
a
pigtail
who
neither
sees
nor
hears
and
your
companion
is
clever
enough
to
be
fascinating
and
daring
enough
to
say
things
he
had
oughter
and
the
music
and
the
moonlight
gets
into
your
head
and
you
feel
young
and
reckless
and
sentimental
then
all
of
a
sudden
memory
recalls
another
moonlight
night
when
the
youth
and
the
romance
were
merely
make
believe
and
your
mind
travels
wearily
over
the
intervening
years
and
you
sit
up
straight
and
look
severe
and
put
your
hands
behind
you
oh
i
am
clinging
to
my
ideal
mate
never
fear
i
held
on
to
her
garments
until
they
are
tattered
and
torn
you
introduced
me
to
her
and
i
have
never
lost
sight
of
her
entirely
this
afternoon
the
victor
sailed
for
the
philippines
as
she
passed
heath
cottage
where
we
had
all
promised
to
be
she
dipped
her
colors
i
felt
pretty
blue
for
i
knew
my
good
times
were
on
board
and
were
sailing
out
of
sight
i
am
now
at
the
hotel
trunk
and
boxes
packed
waiting
to
start
cinderella
is
not
going
to
wait
for
the
stroke
of
twelve
she
has
donned
her
sober
garments
and
is
ready
to
be
whisked
back
to
the
cinders
on
the
hearth
i
am
glad
hard
work
is
ahead
a
solid
grind
seems
necessary
for
my
soul
salvation
farewell
vain
earth
i
love
you
not
wisely
but
too
well
why
ca
people
be
nice
to
one
without
being
too
nice
and
why
you
be
horrid
to
people
without
being
too
horrid
selah
hiroshima
october
dear
old
mate
i
am
so
dead
tired
that
i
could
not
tell
what
part
of
me
ached
the
most
but
the
spirit
moves
me
to
unburden
my
soul
and
i
feel
that
i
must
write
you
for
this
is
one
of
my
nights
and
i
have
so
many
in
japan
when
my
old
shell
is
too
exhausted
to
move
and
so
permits
my
soul
to
wander
where
it
will
a
dream
night
when
the
moon
is
its
silveriest
and
biggest
and
i
want
to
hug
it
for
i
know
that
twelve
hours
before
it
looked
down
on
my
loved
ones
and
now
it
comes
to
make
more
beautiful
this
fairy
land
hiding
the
scars
and
ugly
places
touching
the
pine
trees
with
silver
points
and
glorifying
the
old
temples
till
one
wonders
if
they
have
been
made
by
hands
a
night
when
the
white
robed
priests
are
doing
honor
to
some
heathen
idol
and
must
needs
call
his
wandering
attention
by
the
stroke
of
the
deep
toned
bell
which
sends
its
music
far
across
sleeping
japan
out
into
the
wonderful
sea
i
do
know
what
comes
over
me
such
nights
as
these
i
do
seem
to
be
me
at
all
i
can
lie
most
of
the
night
wide
awake
yet
unconscious
of
my
surroundings
and
dream
dreams
i
live
through
all
the
joyful
days
of
childhood
then
through
the
sorrowful
days
of
womanhood
when
i
was
learning
how
to
live
through
the
years
of
heartache
and
and
through
it
all
though
i
actually
suffer
there
is
such
an
unspeakable
lightness
and
buoyancy
such
a
lifting
up
that
even
pain
is
a
pleasure
i
ca
explain
it
all
unless
it
is
the
influence
of
this
mysterious
country
lulling
and
soothing
but
powerful
and
subtle
as
poison
my
dear
girl
you
say
you
feel
too
far
away
to
help
me
now
do
you
worry
about
that
if
you
never
wrote
me
another
line
you
would
help
me
just
to
know
that
you
are
around
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
believing
in
me
loving
me
and
of
me
means
everything
you
were
right
to
make
me
come
and
while
it
cost
me
my
very
heart
blood
yet
i
am
learning
my
lesson
as
you
said
i
would
my
little
ship
may
never
again
sail
into
the
harbor
of
happiness
yet
there
are
sunny
seas
where
soft
winds
blow
and
even
if
my
ship
is
all
by
its
lonesome
yet
it
such
a
frisky
craft
warranted
never
to
sink
no
matter
what
the
weather
that
it
can
sail
over
many
seas
touch
many
lands
and
grow
rich
in
experience
and
hid
away
in
the
locker
where
no
eye
save
mine
may
see
are
my
treasures
your
love
is
one
and
nothing
can
rob
me
of
it
what
you
write
me
of
jack
makes
me
very
unhappy
i
am
not
worth
his
worrying
over
tell
him
so
mate
if
i
could
ever
care
for
anybody
again
in
this
world
it
would
be
for
him
but
if
an
occasional
sentiment
dares
to
spring
up
into
my
heart
i
pull
it
up
by
the
roots
i
would
give
anything
to
write
to
him
but
i
know
it
would
only
bring
pain
to
us
both
be
good
to
him
mate
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
him
being
miserable
i
am
so
tired
that
i
can
scarcely
keep
the
tears
back
i
must
write
no
more
hiroshima
november
i
have
about
fifteen
minutes
between
classes
and
i
am
going
to
spend
them
on
you
now
who
do
you
suppose
has
come
to
the
surface
again
little
germany
who
was
on
the
steamer
coming
over
he
wasted
a
great
many
stamps
on
me
for
the
first
few
months
after
we
landed
but
he
got
tired
of
playing
solos
he
was
on
his
way
to
thibet
to
enter
a
monastery
to
study
some
ancient
language
heaven
knows
why
he
wants
to
know
anything
more
antique
than
the
language
he
speaks
i
believe
there
is
any
old
dusty
forgotten
corner
of
the
world
that
he
has
poked
into
well
you
know
the
fatal
magnetism
i
exert
over
fossils
they
always
turn
to
me
as
naturally
as
needles
turn
to
a
loadstone
this
particular
mummy
was
no
exception
i
wrote
him
a
formal
stately
answer
reminding
him
in
gentle
reproof
that
i
was
a
widow
god
save
the
mark
and
that
my
life
was
dedicated
to
my
work
it
was
no
use
he
bombarded
me
with
letters
with
bigger
and
bigger
words
and
longer
and
fiercer
quotations
in
the
last
one
he
threatens
to
come
to
hiroshima
if
he
does
i
am
going
to
shave
my
and
black
my
teeth
he
speaks
seven
languages
and
yet
he
does
know
the
meaning
of
the
one
word
no
jack
used
to
say
that
if
a
man
was
persistent
enough
he
could
win
a
woman
in
spite
of
the
devil
i
would
like
to
see
him
i
mean
jack
not
dutchy
nor
the
devil
hiroshima
christmas
eve
i
am
in
the
very
thickest
of
christmas
and
yet
such
a
funny
unreal
christmas
that
it
does
not
seem
natural
at
all
hiroshima
is
busy
decorating
for
the
new
year
and
everything
is
gay
with
brilliant
lanterns
plum
blossoms
and
crimson
berries
the
little
insignificant
streets
are
changed
into
bowers
of
sweet
smelling
ferns
and
spicy
pines
and
the
bamboo
leaves
sway
to
every
breeze
while
the
waxen
plum
blossoms
send
out
a
perfume
sweet
as
violets
the
and
their
families
put
on
their
gayest
kimonos
and
their
most
enticing
smiles
and
greet
you
with
effusion
on
entering
a
shop
you
are
asked
if
your
honorable
eyes
will
deign
to
look
upon
most
unworthy
goods
please
will
you
give
this
or
that
a
little
adoring
look
the
price
ah
it
price
is
greatly
enhanced
since
the
august
foreigner
cast
honorable
eyes
upon
it
which
is
no
joke
whether
the
article
is
bought
or
not
the
smile
the
bow
the
compliment
are
the
same
all
this
time
the
crowd
around
the
door
of
the
shop
has
been
steadily
increasing
until
daylight
is
shut
out
for
everyone
is
interested
in
your
purchase
from
the
man
who
hauls
the
dray
up
to
the
highest
lady
in
the
land
the
is
very
patient
with
the
crowd
until
it
shuts
out
the
light
then
he
invites
them
to
carry
their
useless
bodies
to
the
river
and
throw
them
in
once
outside
you
see
another
crowd
and
as
curiosity
is
in
the
air
you
crane
your
neck
and
try
to
get
closer
the
center
of
attraction
is
a
man
in
spotless
white
cooking
bean
cake
on
a
little
hibachi
the
air
is
cold
and
crisp
and
the
smell
of
the
savory
bean
paste
piping
hot
makes
you
hungry
next
comes
the
fish
man
with
a
big
flat
basket
on
each
end
of
a
pole
and
offers
you
a
choice
lot
long
slippery
eels
beautiful
shrimp
as
pink
as
the
sunset
and
juicy
oysters
whose
shells
have
been
scrubbed
until
they
are
gleaming
white
around
the
baskets
are
garlands
of
paper
roses
to
hide
from
view
the
ugly
rough
edges
of
the
straw
the
candy
shops
tempt
you
to
the
last
sen
and
the
toy
shops
are
a
perfect
joy
funny
fat
japanese
dolls
and
stuffed
rabbits
and
tailless
cats
demand
attention
perhaps
you
will
see
a
cheap
american
doll
with
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
carefully
exhibited
under
a
glass
case
and
when
you
are
wondering
why
they
treasure
this
cheap
toy
you
happen
to
glance
down
and
catch
the
worshipping
gaze
of
a
wistful
half
starved
child
and
your
point
of
view
changes
at
once
and
you
begin
to
understand
the
value
of
it
and
to
wish
with
all
your
heart
that
you
could
put
an
american
dolly
in
the
hands
of
every
little
japanese
girl
on
the
island
it
is
getting
almost
time
to
open
my
box
and
i
am
right
childish
over
it
it
has
been
here
for
two
days
and
i
have
slipped
in
a
dozen
times
to
look
at
it
and
touch
it
oh
mate
the
time
has
been
so
long
so
cruelly
long
i
wake
myself
up
in
the
night
some
time
sobbing
one
year
and
a
half
behind
me
and
two
and
a
half
ahead
i
remember
mother
telling
about
the
day
i
started
to
school
how
i
came
home
and
said
triumphantly
just
think
i
only
got
ten
more
years
to
go
to
school
poor
little
duffer
she
still
going
to
school
last
night
i
had
another
mother
meeting
for
the
mothers
of
the
free
kindergarten
this
time
i
gave
a
magic
lantern
show
and
i
was
the
showman
the
poor
ignorant
women
sat
there
bewildered
they
had
never
seen
a
piano
and
many
of
them
had
never
been
close
to
a
foreigner
before
i
showed
them
about
a
hundred
slides
explained
through
an
interpreter
until
i
was
hoarse
gesticulated
and
orated
to
no
purpose
they
remained
silent
and
stolid
by
and
by
there
was
a
stir
heads
were
raised
and
necks
craned
a
sudden
interest
swept
over
the
room
i
followed
their
gaze
and
saw
on
the
sheet
the
picture
of
christ
toiling
up
the
mountain
under
the
burden
of
the
cross
the
story
was
new
and
strange
to
them
but
the
fact
was
as
old
as
life
itself
at
last
they
had
found
something
that
touched
their
own
lives
and
brought
the
quick
tears
of
sympathy
to
their
eyes
i
am
going
to
have
a
meeting
every
month
for
them
no
matter
what
else
has
to
go
undone
it
is
almost
time
to
hang
up
our
stockings
miss
lessing
and
dixie
objected
at
first
but
i
told
them
i
was
either
going
to
be
very
foolish
or
very
blue
they
could
take
their
choice
i
have
to
do
something
to
scare
away
the
ghosts
of
dead
christmases
so
i
put
on
my
fool
cap
and
jingle
my
bells
when
i
begin
to
weaken
i
go
to
the
piano
and
play
come
ye
disconsolate
to
rag
time
and
it
cheers
me
up
wonderfully
i
guess
it
just
about
daylight
with
you
now
pete
is
tiptoeing
in
to
make
the
fires
i
can
hear
him
now
saying
christmas
gif
mister
sam
gif
miss
bettie
and
the
children
are
flying
around
in
their
night
clothes
wild
with
excitement
down
in
the
sitting
room
the
stockings
make
a
circle
around
the
room
and
underneath
each
is
a
pile
of
gifts
i
can
see
the
big
log
fire
and
the
sparkle
of
it
in
the
old
and
in
the
long
glass
between
the
windows
and
in
a
few
minutes
here
you
all
come
you
uncles
and
you
cousins
and
you
aunts
trooping
in
with
the
smallest
first
and
such
laughing
and
shouting
and
rejoicing
and
maybe
in
the
midst
of
the
fun
somebody
speaks
of
me
and
there
a
little
hush
and
a
little
longing
then
the
fun
goes
on
more
furiously
than
ever
well
even
if
i
am
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
earth
in
body
i
am
not
in
spirit
and
i
reach
my
arms
clear
around
the
world
and
cry
god
bless
you
every
one
hiroshima
march
i
have
a
strong
conviction
that
i
am
going
to
swear
before
i
get
through
this
letter
for
this
pen
is
what
i
would
call
to
use
unmissionary
language
devilish
my
how
familiar
and
wicked
that
word
looks
i
heard
so
many
hymns
and
so
much
brotherly
and
sisterly
talk
that
it
seems
like
meeting
an
old
friend
to
see
it
written
here
it
is
nearly
time
again
and
the
days
and
the
weeks
are
slipping
away
into
months
before
i
know
it
i
am
working
at
full
speed
and
wonder
sometimes
how
i
keep
up
but
i
do
dare
leave
any
leisure
for
heartaches
even
when
the
body
is
quivering
from
weariness
and
every
nerve
cries
out
for
rest
i
must
keep
on
and
on
and
on
for
all
too
easily
the
dread
memories
come
creeping
back
and
enfold
me
until
there
is
no
light
on
any
side
from
morning
until
night
it
is
a
fight
against
the
tide
work
is
the
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
thinking
and
i
am
determined
not
to
think
i
suppose
i
am
as
contented
here
as
i
could
be
anywhere
my
whole
heart
is
in
the
kindergarten
and
the
success
of
it
and
maybe
the
day
will
come
when
my
work
will
be
all
sufficient
to
satisfy
my
soul
craving
but
it
has
come
yet
i
almost
envy
some
of
these
good
people
who
can
stand
in
the
middle
of
one
of
their
prayers
and
touch
all
four
sides
they
know
what
they
want
and
are
satisfied
when
they
get
it
but
i
want
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
the
sun
thrown
in
when
things
seem
closing
in
upon
me
and
everything
looks
dark
i
flee
to
the
woods
i
never
knew
what
the
trees
and
the
wind
and
the
sky
really
meant
until
i
came
out
here
and
had
to
make
friends
of
them
i
think
you
have
to
be
by
yourself
and
a
bit
lonesome
before
nature
ever
begins
to
whisper
her
secrets
can
you
imagine
philistine
me
going
out
on
the
hill
top
to
see
the
and
going
without
my
supper
to
see
it
set
i
am
even
studying
the
little
botany
that
jack
gave
me
though
my
time
and
my
intellect
are
equally
limited
and
speaking
of
jack
leads
me
to
remark
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
all
of
you
to
maintain
such
an
oppressive
silence
concerning
him
three
months
ago
you
wrote
me
that
he
was
not
well
and
that
he
was
going
south
with
you
and
sister
he
must
be
pretty
sick
to
stop
work
even
for
a
week
i
have
pictured
you
sitting
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
wine
beneath
the
bough
quoting
poetry
at
each
other
to
your
heart
content
you
say
when
i
come
home
i
can
rest
on
my
laurels
no
thank
you
i
want
a
morris
chair
a
pitcher
of
lemonade
all
the
new
books
and
a
little
darkey
to
fan
me
heath
has
asked
me
to
visit
her
in
vladivostock
this
summer
and
i
am
going
if
the
cholera
does
get
worse
we
are
so
afraid
of
it
that
we
almost
boil
the
cow
before
we
drink
the
milk
among
the
delicacies
of
our
menu
out
here
are
raw
fish
pickled
parsnips
and
as
old
charity
used
to
say
gotten
so
acclamitized
i
think
i
could
eat
a
gum
shoe
when
they
send
out
my
spring
box
from
home
please
tell
them
to
put
in
some
fluffy
white
dresses
with
elbow
sleeves
then
i
want
lots
of
pretty
ribbons
and
a
white
belt
i
saw
in
the
paper
that
crushed
leather
was
the
proper
thing
it
sounds
like
something
good
to
eat
but
if
it
to
wear
send
it
along
my
disposition
will
be
everlastingly
ruined
if
i
write
another
line
with
this
pen
hiroshima
may
well
the
catastrophe
arrived
and
we
were
prisoners
for
nearly
a
week
it
was
not
quite
cholera
but
close
enough
to
it
to
scare
us
all
to
death
both
eve
and
the
apple
were
young
and
green
and
the
combination
worked
disaster
when
the
doctor
arrived
he
shipped
eve
off
to
the
inspection
hospital
while
we
were
locked
up
guarded
by
five
small
policemen
and
hardly
allowed
to
open
our
mouths
for
fear
we
would
swallow
a
germ
we
were
fumigated
and
until
we
felt
like
steam
puddings
nobody
was
allowed
to
go
in
or
out
our
vegetables
were
handed
to
us
in
a
basket
on
a
bamboo
pole
over
the
wall
we
tied
notes
to
bricks
and
flung
them
to
our
neighbors
on
the
outside
thank
heaven
the
servants
were
locked
in
too
every
day
a
little
man
with
lots
of
brass
buttons
and
a
big
voice
came
and
asked
anxiously
after
our
honorable
insides
i
used
every
inducement
to
get
them
to
let
me
go
out
for
exercise
i
fixed
a
tray
with
my
prettiest
cups
and
sent
a
pot
of
steaming
coffee
and
a
plate
of
cake
out
to
the
lodge
house
word
came
back
we
are
not
permitted
to
drink
or
taste
food
in
an
infected
house
then
i
tried
them
on
bouquets
and
when
that
failed
i
got
desperate
and
announced
that
i
was
subject
to
fits
unless
i
got
regular
outside
exercise
every
day
that
fetched
them
and
they
gave
the
foreign
teachers
permission
to
walk
in
the
country
for
half
an
hour
provided
we
did
not
speak
to
any
one
eve
was
up
and
having
a
good
time
before
the
school
gates
were
opened
while
a
prisoner
i
did
all
sorts
of
odd
jobs
patched
mended
darned
wrote
letters
and
chopped
down
two
trees
the
latter
was
a
little
out
of
my
line
but
the
trees
were
eaten
up
with
caterpillars
and
as
i
could
not
get
anybody
to
cut
them
down
i
sallied
forth
and
did
it
myself
my
chef
stood
by
and
admired
the
job
but
he
would
not
assist
for
fear
he
would
unwittingly
murder
one
of
his
ancestors
you
would
certainly
laugh
to
see
me
keeping
house
with
a
cook
book
a
grocery
book
and
a
dictionary
the
other
day
i
gave
directions
for
poached
eggs
and
the
maid
served
them
in
a
huge
pan
full
of
water
there
are
one
hundred
and
yellow
kids
waiting
for
me
so
i
must
hurry
away
vladivostock
siberia
july
i
did
mean
that
it
should
be
so
long
a
time
before
i
wrote
you
but
the
closing
of
school
the
commencement
and
the
getting
ready
to
come
up
here
about
finished
me
you
remember
the
old
darkey
song
wisht
i
was
in
heaben
settin
down
well
that
was
my
one
ambition
and
i
about
realized
it
when
i
got
up
here
to
heath
and
she
put
me
in
a
hammock
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
porch
and
made
me
keep
blissfully
still
for
two
whole
days
the
air
is
just
as
bracing
the
hills
are
just
as
green
and
the
lights
and
shadows
dance
over
the
harbor
just
as
of
old
we
have
tennis
golf
picnics
sails
and
constant
jollification
but
i
seem
to
enjoy
it
all
as
i
did
last
summer
it
is
altogether
homesickness
though
that
is
chronic
it
is
a
constant
longing
for
i
do
know
what
viewed
impersonally
the
world
is
a
rattling
good
show
but
instead
of
smiling
at
it
from
the
front
row
in
the
dress
circle
i
get
to
be
one
of
the
performers
every
time
we
have
been
greatly
interested
in
watching
the
russians
build
a
fort
on
one
of
their
islands
near
here
they
insist
there
will
be
no
war
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
mining
the
harbor
and
building
forts
day
and
night
the
minute
it
is
dark
the
searchlights
are
kept
busy
sweeping
the
harbor
in
search
of
something
not
strictly
russian
i
hope
i
will
get
back
as
safely
as
i
got
here
did
i
tell
you
that
i
stopped
over
two
days
in
korea
i
had
often
heard
of
the
jumping
off
place
but
i
never
expected
to
actually
see
it
the
people
live
in
the
most
awful
little
mud
houses
and
their
poverty
is
appalling
no
streets
no
roads
no
anything
save
a
fog
of
melancholy
that
seems
to
envelop
everything
the
terrible
helplessness
of
the
people
their
ignorance
and
isolation
are
terrible
the
box
from
home
was
more
than
satisfactory
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
wearing
all
the
pretty
things
the
hat
sister
sent
was
about
the
size
of
a
a
strong
hat
pin
and
a
slight
breeze
will
be
all
i
need
to
travel
to
no
man
land
sister
says
save
the
mark
but
it
really
is
becoming
and
when
i
get
it
on
my
face
looks
like
a
pink
moon
emerging
from
a
fleecy
black
cloud
i
had
to
practice
wearing
it
in
private
until
i
learned
to
balance
it
properly
i
shall
stay
up
here
through
july
and
then
i
am
thinking
of
going
to
shanghai
with
heath
sister
who
lives
there
i
am
very
fond
of
her
and
i
know
i
would
have
a
good
time
i
feel
a
little
like
a
subscription
list
being
passed
around
this
way
but
i
simply
to
keep
going
every
minute
when
i
am
not
at
work
they
are
calling
up
to
me
from
the
tennis
court
so
i
must
stop
for
the
present
shanghai
china
august
the
mail
goes
out
this
morning
and
i
am
determined
to
get
this
letter
written
if
i
break
up
a
dozen
parties
as
you
see
i
am
in
shanghai
this
wonderful
big
understudy
for
chicago
which
seems
about
as
incongruous
in
its
surroundings
as
a
silk
hat
on
a
haystack
there
are
beautiful
boulevards
immense
houses
splendid
public
gardens
all
hedged
in
by
a
yellow
mass
of
orientals
every
nationality
is
represented
here
and
people
meet
mingle
and
separate
in
an
ever
changing
throng
at
every
corner
stands
a
tall
majestic
sikh
with
head
bound
in
yards
of
crimson
cloth
directing
the
movements
of
the
crowd
down
the
street
comes
a
regiment
of
english
soldiers
so
big
and
determined
that
one
well
understands
their
victories
the
ubiquitous
russian
makes
himself
known
at
every
turn
silent
and
grave
but
in
his
simplest
dealings
as
merciless
and
greedy
as
the
country
he
represents
frenchmen
and
germans
and
best
of
all
the
unquenchable
american
join
in
the
panorama
and
the
result
is
something
that
one
does
not
see
anywhere
else
on
the
globe
i
guess
if
my
dear
brethren
knew
of
the
theatre
parties
dinners
and
dances
i
was
going
to
they
would
think
i
was
on
a
toboggan
slide
for
the
lower
regions
i
am
mot
though
i
am
simply
getting
a
good
swing
to
the
pendulum
so
that
i
can
go
back
to
the
field
and
the
baby
organs
and
the
with
better
grace
it
is
very
funny
but
do
you
know
that
for
a
i
can
stand
the
saints
much
better
than
i
can
the
sinners
my
friends
the
carters
live
right
on
the
bund
facing
the
water
they
keep
lots
of
horses
and
many
servants
and
live
in
a
luxury
that
only
the
east
can
offer
every
morning
before
i
am
up
a
slippery
chinese
all
done
up
in
livery
comes
to
my
room
and
solemnly
announces
missy
bath
allee
ready
nice
morning
from
that
time
on
i
am
scarcely
allowed
to
carry
my
pocket
handkerchief
the
roads
about
here
are
perfect
and
we
drive
for
hours
past
big
country
houses
all
built
in
english
fashion
there
is
one
grewsome
feature
in
the
landscape
however
and
that
is
the
chinese
graves
in
the
fields
in
the
back
and
front
yards
on
the
highways
any
bare
space
that
is
large
enough
to
set
a
box
and
cover
it
with
a
little
earth
serves
as
a
burying
ground
i
am
interested
in
it
all
and
enjoying
it
in
a
way
but
mate
there
is
no
use
fibbing
to
you
there
is
a
restlessness
in
my
heart
that
sometimes
almost
drives
me
crazy
there
is
nothing
under
god
sun
that
can
repay
a
woman
for
the
loss
of
love
and
home
it
all
right
to
love
humanity
but
i
was
born
a
specialist
the
past
is
torn
out
by
the
roots
but
the
awful
emptiness
remains
i
am
not
grieving
over
what
has
been
but
what
is
that
last
sentence
sounds
malarial
i
am
going
right
upstairs
to
take
a
quinine
pill
soochow
august
well
mate
this
is
the
first
letter
i
have
really
written
you
from
china
shanghai
does
count
soochow
is
the
real
article
the
unspeakable
quantity
and
quality
of
dirt
surpasses
anything
i
have
ever
imagined
dirt
and
babies
there
are
millions
of
babies
under
your
feet
around
your
heels
every
nook
and
corner
full
of
babies
from
shanghai
to
soochow
is
only
a
one
night
trip
and
as
i
had
an
invitation
to
come
up
for
over
sunday
i
decided
to
take
advantage
of
it
you
would
have
to
see
the
boat
i
came
in
to
appreciate
it
they
call
it
a
but
it
is
built
on
a
pattern
that
is
new
to
me
in
the
lower
part
are
rooms
each
of
which
is
supplied
with
a
board
on
which
you
are
supposed
to
sleep
each
passenger
carries
his
own
bedding
and
food
in
the
upper
part
of
the
boat
is
a
sort
of
loft
just
high
enough
for
a
man
to
sit
up
and
in
it
are
crowded
hundreds
of
the
common
people
a
launch
tows
seven
or
eight
of
these
at
a
time
i
will
not
ask
you
to
even
imagine
the
condition
of
them
i
had
to
stand
it
because
i
was
there
but
you
are
not
it
was
just
at
sunset
when
we
left
shanghai
and
i
got
as
far
away
from
the
crowd
as
i
could
and
tried
to
forget
my
unsavory
surroundings
the
sails
of
thousands
of
chinese
vessels
loomed
black
and
big
against
the
red
sky
as
they
floated
silently
by
without
a
ripple
in
the
dim
light
i
read
on
the
prow
of
a
bulky
schooner
mary
boston
do
you
know
how
my
heart
leapt
out
to
the
mary
boston
it
was
the
one
thing
in
all
that
vast
unfamiliar
world
that
spoke
my
tongue
when
i
went
to
my
room
i
found
that
a
nice
little
chinese
girl
in
a
long
sack
coat
and
shiny
black
trousers
was
to
share
it
with
me
i
must
confess
that
i
was
relieved
for
i
was
lonesome
and
a
bit
nervous
and
when
i
discovered
that
she
knew
a
little
english
i
could
have
hugged
her
we
spread
our
cold
supper
on
the
top
of
my
dress
suit
case
put
our
one
candle
in
the
center
and
proceeded
to
feast
little
miss
izy
was
not
as
shy
as
she
looked
and
what
she
lacked
in
vocabulary
she
made
up
in
enthusiasm
we
got
into
a
gale
of
laughter
over
our
efforts
to
understand
each
other
and
she
was
as
curious
about
my
costume
as
i
was
about
hers
she
watched
me
undress
with
unfeigned
amusement
following
the
lengthy
process
carefully
then
she
rose
untied
a
string
stepped
out
of
her
coat
and
trousers
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
white
suit
made
exactly
like
her
outer
garments
then
gaily
kicked
off
her
tiny
slippers
and
rolled
over
in
bed
i
know
if
this
is
a
universal
custom
in
china
but
at
any
rate
little
miss
izy
will
never
be
like
the
old
lady
who
committed
suicide
because
she
was
so
tired
of
buttoning
and
unbuttoning
the
next
morning
we
were
in
soochow
at
least
outside
of
the
city
wall
they
say
the
wall
is
over
two
thousand
years
old
and
it
certainly
looks
it
and
the
spaces
on
top
left
for
the
guns
to
point
through
make
it
look
as
if
it
had
lost
most
of
its
teeth
things
are
so
old
in
this
place
mate
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
just
been
born
i
have
nearly
ran
my
legs
off
sightseeing
big
pagodas
and
little
pagodas
mamma
buddhas
and
papa
buddhas
and
baby
buddhas
all
of
whom
look
exactly
like
their
first
cousins
in
japan
soochow
is
just
a
collection
of
narrow
over
which
the
house
tops
meet
and
through
which
the
people
swarm
by
the
millions
sellers
crying
their
wares
merchants
urging
patronage
children
screaming
beggars
displaying
their
infirmities
and
through
it
all
coolies
carrying
sedan
chairs
scattering
the
crowd
before
them
in
many
of
the
temples
the
priests
hang
wind
bells
to
frighten
the
evil
spirits
away
i
think
it
is
a
needless
precaution
for
it
would
only
be
a
spirit
that
would
ever
want
to
return
to
china
once
it
had
gotten
away
hiroshima
october
in
harness
again
and
glad
of
it
i
opened
the
third
kindergarten
with
the
money
from
home
it
only
a
little
one
eighteen
children
in
all
and
there
were
applicants
but
it
is
a
beginning
you
ought
to
see
the
mothers
crowding
around
begging
and
pleading
for
their
children
to
be
taken
in
and
the
little
tots
weep
and
wail
when
they
have
to
go
home
i
feel
as
if
i
would
almost
resort
to
highway
robbery
to
get
money
enough
to
carry
on
this
work
my
training
class
is
just
as
interesting
as
it
can
be
when
the
girls
came
to
me
two
years
ago
they
were
in
the
third
reader
with
two
exceptions
i
have
given
them
everything
that
was
included
in
my
own
course
at
home
and
taught
them
english
besides
they
are
very
ambitious
and
what
do
you
suppose
is
their
chief
aim
in
life
to
study
until
they
know
as
much
as
i
do
oh
mate
it
makes
me
want
to
hide
my
head
in
shame
when
i
think
of
all
the
opportunities
i
wasted
you
know
only
too
well
what
a
miserable
little
rubbish
pile
of
learning
i
possess
but
what
you
know
is
how
i
have
studied
and
toiled
and
burned
the
midnight
tallow
in
trying
to
work
over
those
old
odds
and
ends
into
something
useful
for
my
girls
if
they
have
made
such
progress
under
a
superficial
thing
like
me
what
they
have
done
under
a
woman
with
brains
i
wish
you
could
look
in
on
me
sitting
here
surrounded
by
all
my
household
goods
the
room
is
bright
and
cozy
and
just
at
present
i
have
a
it
is
a
little
sick
girl
from
the
training
class
whom
i
have
taken
care
of
since
i
came
back
she
belongs
to
a
very
poor
family
down
in
the
country
her
mother
is
dead
and
her
home
life
is
very
unhappy
she
nearly
breaks
her
heart
crying
when
we
speak
of
sending
her
home
and
begs
me
to
help
her
get
well
so
she
can
go
on
with
her
studies
of
course
she
is
a
great
care
but
i
get
up
a
little
earlier
and
go
to
bed
a
little
later
and
so
manage
to
get
it
all
in
we
are
getting
quite
stirred
up
over
the
war
clouds
that
are
hanging
over
this
little
country
savage
old
russia
is
doing
a
lot
of
bullying
and
the
japanese
are
not
going
to
stand
much
more
they
are
drilling
and
marching
and
soldiering
now
for
all
they
are
worth
from
kuri
the
naval
station
we
can
hear
the
thunder
of
the
guns
which
are
in
constant
practice
out
on
the
parade
grounds
in
the
barracks
on
every
country
road
preparation
is
going
on
officers
high
in
rank
and
from
the
emperor
guard
are
here
reviewing
the
troops
those
who
know
say
a
crash
is
bound
to
come
so
if
you
hear
of
me
in
a
red
cross
uniform
at
the
front
you
need
be
surprised
hiroshima
november
my
dear
old
mate
i
am
just
tired
enough
to
fold
my
hands
and
turn
up
my
toes
and
say
enough
if
overcoming
difficulties
makes
character
then
i
will
have
as
many
characters
as
the
chinese
alphabet
by
the
time
i
get
through
the
bothers
meet
me
when
the
girl
makes
the
fire
in
the
morning
and
puts
the
ashes
in
the
grate
instead
of
the
coal
and
they
keep
right
along
with
me
all
day
until
i
go
to
bed
at
night
and
find
the
sheet
under
the
mattress
and
the
pillows
at
the
foot
it
would
be
near
so
hard
if
i
could
charge
around
and
let
off
a
little
of
my
wrath
but
no
i
must
be
nice
and
sweet
and
polite
and
forget
that
i
am
an
example
have
you
ever
seen
these
dolls
that
have
a
weight
in
them
so
that
you
can
push
them
over
and
they
stand
right
up
again
well
i
have
a
large
one
and
her
name
is
susie
damn
when
things
reach
the
limit
of
endurance
i
take
it
out
on
susie
damn
i
box
her
jaws
and
knock
her
over
and
up
she
comes
every
time
with
such
a
pleasant
smile
that
i
get
in
a
good
humor
again
what
is
the
matter
with
you
at
home
why
do
you
write
to
me
i
used
to
get
ten
and
twelve
letters
every
mail
and
now
if
i
get
one
i
am
ready
to
cry
for
joy
because
i
am
busy
does
not
mean
that
i
have
time
to
be
lonely
why
mate
you
can
never
know
what
loneliness
means
until
you
are
entirely
away
from
everything
you
love
i
have
tried
to
be
brave
but
i
have
always
made
a
grand
success
of
it
what
i
have
suffered
well
do
let
me
talk
about
it
as
little
germany
says
to
live
is
to
love
and
to
love
is
to
suffer
and
yet
it
is
for
that
love
we
are
ready
to
suffer
and
die
and
without
it
life
is
a
blank
a
sail
without
a
wind
a
frame
without
the
picture
now
i
may
get
one
of
your
big
letters
and
you
will
tell
me
how
grand
i
am
and
how
my
soul
is
developing
and
i
get
such
a
stiff
upper
lip
that
my
front
teeth
will
be
in
danger
it
takes
a
stiff
upper
lip
and
a
stiff
conscience
and
a
stiff
everything
else
to
keep
going
out
here
from
the
foregoing
outburst
you
probably
think
i
am
pale
and
dejected
no
on
the
contrary
as
the
seasick
frenchman
said
when
asked
if
he
had
dined
i
am
hale
and
hearty
and
i
never
had
as
much
color
in
my
life
the
work
is
booming
and
i
have
all
sorts
of
things
to
be
thankful
for
our
little
household
has
been
very
much
upset
this
week
by
the
death
of
our
cook
the
funeral
took
place
last
night
at
seven
from
the
lodge
house
at
the
gate
the
shadows
made
on
the
paper
screens
as
they
prepared
him
for
burial
told
an
uncanny
story
the
lack
of
delicacy
the
coarseness
the
total
disregard
for
the
dignity
of
death
were
all
pictured
on
the
doors
i
stood
in
the
chapel
and
watched
with
a
sick
heart
after
they
had
crowded
the
poor
old
body
into
a
sitting
position
in
a
sort
of
square
tub
they
brought
it
out
to
the
coolies
who
were
to
carry
it
to
the
temple
and
afterward
to
the
crematory
the
lanterns
flickered
with
an
unsteady
light
making
grotesque
figures
that
seemed
to
dance
in
fiendish
glee
on
the
grass
the
men
laughed
and
chattered
and
at
last
shouldered
their
burden
and
trotted
off
as
merrily
as
if
they
were
going
to
a
matsuri
i
never
before
felt
the
cruelty
of
heathenism
so
keenly
no
punishment
in
the
next
world
can
equal
the
things
they
miss
in
this
life
by
a
lack
of
belief
in
a
personal
god
it
must
be
very
beautiful
at
home
about
this
time
the
beech
trees
are
all
green
and
gold
and
the
maples
are
blazing
i
am
thinking
too
about
the
shadows
on
the
old
i
know
every
one
of
them
by
heart
and
they
often
come
to
haunt
me
as
do
many
other
shadows
of
the
sad
sad
past
hiroshima
december
god
bless
you
honey
i
got
a
holiday
and
i
sworn
vengeance
on
anyone
who
comes
to
my
door
until
i
have
written
my
christmas
letters
i
wish
i
was
a
doctor
and
a
trained
nurse
and
a
scholar
a
magician
a
philosopher
and
a
saint
all
combined
i
need
them
in
my
business
i
have
spent
this
merry
christmas
season
chasing
from
pillow
to
post
with
bandages
hot
water
bags
poultices
and
bottles
we
have
had
a
regular
hospital
all
the
christmas
money
i
had
saved
to
buy
presents
for
home
went
in
cod
liver
oil
and
miss
lessing
bless
her
soul
is
doing
without
a
coat
for
the
same
purpose
when
you
see
a
girl
struggling
for
what
little
education
she
can
get
and
know
what
sacrifices
are
being
made
for
it
you
just
hate
your
frumpery
old
finery
and
you
want
to
convert
everything
you
possess
into
cash
to
help
her
all
the
teachers
are
doing
without
fires
in
their
rooms
this
winter
and
it
is
rather
chillsome
to
go
to
bed
cold
and
wake
up
next
morning
in
the
same
condition
when
i
get
home
to
a
house
and
have
cream
in
my
coffee
i
shall
feel
too
dissipated
to
be
respectable
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
a
new
cook
since
our
old
one
died
and
the
fact
must
have
gotten
abroad
for
all
the
floating
brethren
and
sisters
in
japan
have
been
to
see
us
and
have
sifted
in
and
we
have
to
sit
up
and
be
marthas
and
marys
all
at
the
same
time
sometimes
i
want
to
get
my
hat
and
run
and
run
until
i
get
to
another
planet
but
i
am
not
made
of
the
stuff
that
runs
and
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
have
stuck
to
my
post
if
sacrificing
self
and
knocking
longings
in
the
head
and
smashing
right
and
left
do
not
pass
me
through
the
golden
gate
then
i
sue
peter
for
damages
it
snowing
but
the
old
earth
is
making
about
as
poor
a
bluff
at
being
christmasy
as
i
am
the
leaves
are
all
on
the
trees
many
flowers
are
in
bloom
and
the
scarlet
geraniums
are
warm
enough
to
melt
the
snow
flakes
my
big
box
has
arrived
and
i
am
keeping
it
until
i
go
out
and
sit
on
it
every
little
while
to
keep
cheered
up
this
is
my
third
christmas
from
home
one
more
and
then
there
has
been
too
much
sickness
to
make
much
of
the
holiday
but
i
have
rigged
up
a
fish
pond
for
the
kindergarten
children
and
each
kiddie
will
have
a
present
that
cost
of
a
cent
i
wish
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
to
spend
on
them
when
the
lights
are
out
my
little
sick
girl
stocking
will
hang
on
one
bed
post
and
mine
on
the
other
i
do
believe
santa
glaus
will
have
the
heart
to
pass
us
by
do
you
hiroshima
january
here
it
is
january
and
i
am
just
thanking
you
dear
ones
for
my
beautiful
christmas
box
as
you
probably
guessed
mate
our
christmas
was
not
exactly
hilarious
the
winter
has
been
a
hard
one
the
prospect
of
war
has
sent
the
price
of
provisions
out
of
sight
the
sick
girls
in
the
school
have
needed
medicine
and
fires
so
altogether
miss
lessing
miss
dixon
and
i
have
had
to
do
considerable
tugging
at
the
ends
to
get
them
to
meet
none
of
us
have
bought
a
stitch
of
new
clothing
this
winter
so
when
our
boxes
came
we
were
positively
dazed
by
all
the
grandeur
they
arrived
late
at
night
and
we
got
out
of
bed
to
open
them
the
first
thing
i
struck
was
a
very
crumpled
little
paper
doll
with
baby
bess
name
printed
in
letters
on
the
back
for
the
next
five
minutes
i
was
kept
busy
swallowing
the
lumps
that
came
in
my
throat
but
dixie
had
some
peppermint
candy
out
of
her
box
the
first
i
had
seen
since
i
had
left
home
so
i
put
on
my
lovely
new
beaver
hat
which
with
my
gown
and
red
slippers
was
particularly
chic
and
i
sat
on
the
floor
and
ate
candy
it
the
hat
and
the
candy
too
went
a
long
way
towards
restoring
my
equanimity
but
i
dare
look
at
that
paper
doll
again
that
night
you
ask
if
i
mind
wearing
that
beautiful
crêpe
de
chine
which
is
not
becoming
to
you
well
mate
i
suppose
there
was
a
day
when
i
would
have
scorned
anybody
clothes
but
i
pledge
you
my
word
a
queen
in
her
coronation
robes
never
felt
half
so
grand
as
i
feel
in
that
dress
somehow
i
seem
to
assume
some
of
your
personality
i
look
tall
and
graceful
and
dignified
and
i
try
to
imagine
how
it
feels
to
be
good
and
intellectual
and
fascinating
and
besides
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
am
rather
becoming
to
the
dress
myself
it
fits
without
a
wrinkle
and
next
summer
with
my
big
black
hat
well
if
little
germany
sees
me
there
will
be
something
doing
i
must
tell
you
an
experience
i
had
the
other
day
miss
lessing
and
i
were
coming
back
on
the
train
from
miyajima
and
sitting
opposite
to
us
was
an
old
couple
who
very
soon
told
us
that
they
had
never
seen
foreigners
before
they
were
as
guileless
as
children
and
presently
the
old
man
came
over
and
asked
if
he
might
look
at
my
jacket
i
had
no
objections
so
he
put
his
hands
lightly
on
my
shoulders
and
turned
me
around
for
inspection
but
he
said
to
miss
lessing
in
japanese
how
does
she
get
into
it
i
took
it
off
to
show
him
and
in
so
doing
revealed
fresh
wonders
he
returned
to
his
wife
and
after
a
long
consultation
and
many
inquiring
looks
he
came
back
he
said
he
knew
he
was
a
great
trouble
but
i
was
most
honorably
kind
and
would
i
tell
him
why
i
wore
a
piece
of
leather
about
my
waist
and
would
i
please
remove
my
dress
and
show
them
how
i
put
it
on
he
was
distinctly
disappointed
when
i
declined
but
he
managed
to
get
in
one
more
question
and
that
was
if
we
slept
in
our
hats
when
he
got
off
he
assured
us
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
interesting
in
his
life
and
he
would
have
great
things
to
tell
the
people
of
his
village
there
is
a
place
you
go
or
a
thing
you
do
out
here
that
afford
some
kind
of
amusement
the
first
glamour
of
the
country
has
gotten
dimmed
a
bit
not
that
the
interest
has
waned
for
a
moment
but
i
have
come
to
see
that
the
beauty
and
picturesqueness
are
largely
on
the
surface
if
ever
i
have
to
distribute
tracts
in
another
world
i
am
going
to
wrap
a
piece
of
soap
in
every
one
for
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
surest
way
to
heaven
for
the
heathen
is
the
soapy
way
during
the
holidays
i
tried
to
study
up
a
little
and
add
a
drop
or
two
to
that
gray
matter
that
is
supposed
to
be
floating
around
in
my
brain
but
as
a
girl
said
of
a
child
in
kindergarten
my
intelligence
was
not
working
putting
psychology
into
easy
terms
stopping
to
explain
things
i
do
not
understand
very
well
myself
struggling
through
the
medium
of
a
strange
language
and
trying
to
occidentalize
the
oriental
mind
has
been
a
stiff
proposition
for
one
whose
learning
was
never
her
long
suit
when
i
come
home
i
may
be
nothing
but
a
giggly
childishly
happy
old
lady
who
does
care
a
rap
whether
her
skin
fits
or
not
the
prospect
of
war
is
getting
more
and
more
serious
out
in
the
inland
sea
the
war
ships
are
hastening
here
and
there
on
all
sorts
of
secret
missions
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
there
will
not
be
war
but
if
there
is
i
hope
japan
will
wipe
russia
right
off
the
map
hiroshima
february
dear
old
mate
i
am
breathless
for
three
weeks
i
have
had
a
chase
up
hill
and
down
dale
to
the
top
of
pine
clad
mountains
into
the
misty
shadows
of
the
deep
valleys
up
and
down
the
silvery
river
to
and
fro
on
the
frosty
road
for
why
all
because
i
had
lost
my
poise
that
treasured
possession
which
you
said
i
was
to
hang
on
to
as
i
do
to
my
front
teeth
and
my
hair
so
when
i
found
it
was
gone
i
started
in
full
pursuit
never
a
sight
of
its
coat
tails
did
i
catch
until
sunday
when
i
gave
up
the
race
and
sat
me
down
to
fight
out
the
old
fight
of
rebellion
and
kicking
against
the
pricks
it
was
a
perfect
day
the
plum
trees
were
white
with
blossom
the
spice
bushes
heavy
with
fragrance
the
river
dancing
for
joy
and
the
whole
earth
springing
into
new
tender
life
a
saucy
little
bird
sat
on
an
old
stone
lantern
and
sang
straight
at
me
he
told
me
i
was
a
whiney
young
person
that
it
was
lots
more
fun
to
catch
worms
and
fly
around
in
the
sunshine
than
it
was
to
sit
in
the
house
and
mope
he
actually
laughed
at
me
and
i
seized
my
hat
and
lit
out
after
him
and
when
i
came
home
i
found
i
had
caught
my
poise
in
class
i
asked
my
girls
what
happiness
meant
one
new
girl
looked
up
timidly
and
said
sensei
i
sink
him
just
mean
i
felt
like
a
hypocrite
but
it
pleased
me
to
know
that
on
the
outside
at
least
i
kept
shiny
i
tell
you
if
i
do
find
my
real
self
out
here
if
i
do
see
my
own
soul
in
all
its
bareness
and
weakness
then
i
will
never
see
it
at
home
hedged
in
by
conventionality
custom
and
the
hundred
little
interests
of
our
daily
life
we
have
small
chance
to
see
ourselves
as
we
really
are
but
in
a
foreign
land
stripped
bare
of
everything
in
the
world
save
in
a
loneliness
as
great
sometimes
as
the
grave
face
to
face
with
new
conditions
new
demands
we
have
ample
chance
to
take
our
own
measurement
i
can
not
say
that
the
result
obtained
is
calculated
to
make
one
conceited
i
fit
into
this
life
out
here
like
a
square
peg
in
a
round
hole
i
am
not
consecrated
i
was
never
to
the
foreign
field
i
love
the
world
and
the
flesh
even
if
i
do
care
especially
for
the
devil
i
do
believe
the
lord
makes
the
cook
steal
so
i
may
be
more
patient
and
i
do
pray
for
wisdom
in
selecting
a
new
pair
of
shoes
when
my
position
becomes
unbearable
i
invariably
face
the
matter
frankly
and
remind
myself
that
if
it
is
hard
on
the
peg
it
is
just
as
hard
on
the
hole
and
that
if
they
can
stand
it
i
guess
i
can
you
ask
about
my
reading
yes
i
read
every
spare
minute
i
can
get
before
breakfast
on
my
way
to
classes
and
after
i
go
to
bed
somebody
at
home
sends
me
the
magazines
regularly
and
i
keep
them
going
for
months
by
the
way
i
wish
you
would
write
and
tell
me
just
exactly
how
jack
is
you
said
he
was
working
too
hard
and
that
he
looked
all
fagged
out
was
it
exactly
like
him
to
back
out
of
going
south
on
account
of
his
conscience
he
would
laugh
at
us
for
saying
it
was
that
but
it
was
he
may
be
unreligious
and
scoff
at
churches
and
all
that
but
he
has
the
most
rigid
inelastic
conscience
that
i
ever
came
across
i
wish
he
would
take
a
rest
you
see
out
here
so
far
away
from
you
all
i
ca
help
worrying
when
any
of
you
are
the
least
bit
sick
jack
has
been
on
my
mind
for
days
do
tell
him
that
i
asked
you
to
but
wo
you
get
him
to
go
away
he
would
curl
his
hair
if
you
asked
him
to
preparations
for
war
are
still
in
progress
and
it
makes
a
fellow
pretty
shivery
to
see
it
coming
closer
and
closer
hiroshima
will
be
the
center
of
military
movements
and
of
course
under
military
law
it
will
affect
us
only
as
to
the
restrictions
put
on
our
walks
and
places
we
can
go
with
the
city
so
full
of
strange
soldiers
i
do
suppose
we
will
want
to
go
much
two
big
war
ships
which
japan
has
just
bought
from
chili
are
on
their
way
from
shanghai
regiment
after
regiment
has
poured
into
hiroshima
and
embarked
again
for
corea
i
am
terribly
thrilled
over
it
all
and
the
japanese
watch
my
enthusiasm
with
their
eyes
and
never
say
a
word
my
poor
little
sick
girl
grows
weaker
all
the
time
she
is
a
constant
care
and
anxiety
but
she
has
no
money
and
i
can
not
send
her
back
to
her
wretched
home
the
teachers
think
i
am
very
foolish
to
let
the
thing
run
on
and
i
suppose
i
am
she
can
never
be
any
better
and
she
may
live
this
way
for
months
but
when
she
clings
to
me
with
her
frail
hands
and
declares
she
is
better
and
will
soon
get
well
if
i
will
only
let
her
stay
with
me
my
heart
fails
me
i
have
patched
up
an
old
steamer
chair
for
her
and
made
a
window
garden
and
tried
to
make
the
room
as
bright
as
possible
she
has
to
stay
by
herself
nearly
all
day
but
she
is
so
patient
and
gentle
that
i
never
hear
a
complaint
this
morning
she
pressed
my
hand
to
her
breast
and
said
wistfully
sensei
it
makes
sorry
to
play
all
the
time
with
the
health
miss
lessing
tried
to
get
her
in
the
hospital
but
they
will
not
take
incurables
somehow
jack
hospital
scheme
does
seem
as
foolish
as
it
did
if
there
are
other
children
in
the
world
as
friendless
and
dependent
as
this
one
then
making
a
permanent
home
for
them
would
be
worth
all
the
great
careers
in
the
world
hiroshima
march
my
best
girl
do
i
wish
you
were
here
to
share
all
these
thrills
with
me
war
is
actually
in
progress
and
if
you
could
see
me
hanging
out
of
the
window
at
midnight
yelling
for
a
special
then
chasing
madly
around
to
get
someone
to
translate
it
for
me
see
me
dancing
in
fiendish
glee
at
every
victory
won
by
this
brave
little
country
you
would
conclude
that
i
am
just
as
young
as
i
used
to
be
i
tell
you
i
could
be
prouder
of
my
own
country
just
think
of
plucky
little
old
japan
winning
three
battles
from
those
big
brutal
conceited
russians
why
i
just
want
to
run
and
hug
the
emperor
and
the
school
girls
why
their
placid
faces
are
positively
glorified
by
the
fire
of
patriotism
once
a
week
a
trained
nurse
comes
to
give
talks
on
nursing
and
if
i
go
into
any
corner
afterward
i
find
a
group
of
girls
practising
all
kinds
of
bandaging
even
the
demurest
little
maiden
cherishes
the
hope
that
some
fate
may
send
her
to
the
or
that
in
some
way
she
may
be
permitted
to
serve
her
country
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
very
strict
about
talking
in
class
these
days
but
somehow
courage
nobility
and
seem
just
as
worthy
of
attention
as
motor
ideas
and
apperceptions
a
british
guest
who
hates
everything
japanese
says
my
enthusiasm
is
quite
annoying
you
know
but
dear
me
i
do
mind
him
what
could
you
expect
of
a
person
who
eats
pie
with
a
spoon
why
my
enthusiasm
is
just
cutting
its
the
whole
country
is
and
even
a
wooden
indian
would
get
excited
every
afternoon
we
walk
down
on
the
sea
wall
and
watch
the
preparations
going
on
for
a
long
siege
hundreds
of
big
ships
fill
the
harbor
to
say
nothing
of
the
small
ones
and
there
are
thousands
of
coolies
working
like
mad
i
could
tell
you
many
interesting
things
but
i
am
afraid
of
the
censor
if
he
deciphers
all
my
letters
home
he
will
probably
have
nervous
prostration
by
the
time
the
war
is
over
many
of
the
war
ships
are
coaled
by
women
who
carry
heavy
baskets
on
each
end
of
a
pole
swung
across
the
shoulder
and
invariably
a
baby
on
their
backs
it
is
something
terrible
the
way
the
women
work
often
pulling
loads
that
would
require
a
horse
at
home
they
go
plodding
past
us
on
the
road
dressed
as
men
mouth
open
eyes
straining
all
intelligence
and
interest
gone
from
their
faces
one
day
as
miss
lessing
and
i
were
resting
by
the
roadside
one
of
these
women
stopped
for
breath
just
in
front
of
us
she
was
pushing
a
heavy
cart
and
her
poor
old
body
was
trembling
from
the
strain
her
legs
were
bare
and
her
feet
were
cut
by
the
stones
there
was
absolute
stolidity
in
her
face
and
the
hands
that
lighted
her
pipe
were
gnarled
and
black
miss
lessing
has
a
perfect
genius
for
getting
at
people
i
think
it
is
her
good
kind
face
through
which
her
soul
shines
she
asked
the
old
woman
if
she
was
very
tired
the
woman
looked
up
as
if
seeing
us
for
the
first
time
and
nodded
her
head
then
a
queer
look
came
into
her
face
and
she
asked
miss
lessing
if
we
were
the
kind
of
people
who
had
a
new
god
miss
lessing
told
her
we
were
christians
with
a
wistfulness
that
i
have
never
seen
except
in
the
eyes
of
a
dog
she
said
if
i
paid
your
god
with
offering
and
prayers
do
you
think
he
would
make
my
work
easier
i
am
so
tired
miss
lessing
made
her
sit
down
by
her
on
the
grass
and
talked
to
her
in
japanese
about
the
new
god
who
did
not
take
any
pay
for
his
help
and
who
could
put
something
in
her
heart
that
would
give
her
strength
to
bear
any
burden
i
could
not
understand
much
of
what
they
said
but
i
had
a
little
all
by
myself
hiroshima
april
yesterday
the
american
mail
came
after
a
three
weeks
delay
none
of
us
were
good
for
anything
the
rest
of
the
day
twenty
letters
and
papers
for
me
do
you
wonder
that
i
almost
danced
a
hole
in
the
parlor
rug
the
home
news
was
all
so
bright
and
cheery
and
your
letter
was
such
a
bunch
of
comfort
that
i
felt
like
a
two
year
old
it
was
exactly
like
you
to
think
out
that
little
farm
party
and
get
jack
into
it
as
a
matter
of
accommodation
to
you
i
followed
everything
you
did
with
the
keenest
interest
from
the
tramps
in
the
woods
to
the
cozy
evenings
around
the
log
fire
i
can
see
old
jack
now
at
first
bored
to
death
but
resolved
to
die
if
need
be
on
the
altar
of
friendship
gradually
warming
up
as
he
always
does
out
of
doors
and
ending
up
by
being
the
life
of
the
party
he
once
told
me
that
social
success
is
the
infinite
capacity
for
being
bored
i
know
the
little
outing
did
him
a
world
of
good
and
you
are
all
the
trumps
in
the
deck
as
usual
who
is
the
leet
that
was
in
the
party
i
remember
dancing
a
cotillon
with
a
very
good
looking
youth
of
that
name
in
the
prehistoric
ages
he
was
a
senior
at
yale
very
rich
and
very
good
looking
i
wore
his
fraternity
pin
over
my
heart
for
a
whole
week
afterward
we
have
been
having
great
fun
over
the
american
accounts
of
the
war
through
the
newspapers
we
learn
the
most
marvelous
things
about
japan
and
her
people
large
cities
are
unblushingly
moved
from
the
coast
to
an
island
in
the
inland
sea
troops
are
passported
from
places
which
have
no
harbor
and
the
people
are
credited
with
unheard
of
customs
we
are
still
in
the
midst
of
stirring
times
the
city
is
overflowing
with
troops
and
we
are
hemmed
in
on
every
side
by
soldiers
of
course
foreign
women
are
very
curious
to
them
and
they
often
follow
us
and
make
funny
comments
but
we
have
never
yet
had
a
single
rudeness
shown
us
in
all
the
thousands
of
soldiers
stationed
here
i
have
only
seen
two
who
were
tipsy
and
they
were
mildly
hilarious
from
saki
there
is
perfect
order
and
discipline
and
after
nine
at
night
the
streets
are
as
quiet
as
a
mountain
village
the
other
night
five
of
the
soldiers
mere
boys
donned
dress
and
went
out
for
a
lark
at
they
were
missing
and
a
guard
was
sent
to
search
for
them
when
found
they
resisted
arrest
and
three
minutes
after
they
all
answered
the
in
another
world
and
yet
although
the
discipline
is
so
severe
the
men
seem
a
contented
and
happy
lot
they
stroll
along
the
roads
when
off
duty
hand
in
hand
like
school
girls
and
laugh
and
chatter
as
if
life
were
a
big
holiday
but
when
the
time
comes
to
go
to
the
front
they
don
their
gay
little
uniforms
and
march
just
as
joyfully
away
to
give
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
for
their
emperor
i
tell
you
mate
i
want
to
get
out
in
the
street
and
cheer
every
regiment
that
passes
no
drum
no
fife
no
inspiring
music
to
stir
their
blood
and
strengthen
their
courage
nothing
but
the
unvarying
monotony
of
the
four
note
trumpets
they
do
need
music
to
make
them
go
they
are
perfect
little
machines
whose
motive
power
is
a
patriotism
so
absolute
so
complete
that
it
makes
death
on
the
an
honor
worthy
of
deification
i
look
out
into
the
and
every
boy
down
to
the
smallest
baby
in
the
kindergarten
is
armed
with
a
bamboo
gun
such
drilling
and
marching
and
attacking
of
forts
you
have
never
seen
that
the
enemy
is
nothing
more
than
sticks
stuck
at
all
angles
matters
little
an
enemy
there
must
be
and
the
worst
boy
in
japan
would
die
before
he
would
even
at
being
a
russian
if
kuropatkin
could
see
just
one
of
these
awful
onslaughts
he
would
run
up
the
white
flag
and
hie
himself
to
safety
so
you
see
we
are
well
guarded
and
with
quiet
little
soldiers
on
the
outside
and
very
noisy
and
fierce
little
soldiers
on
the
inside
we
fear
no
invasion
of
our
peaceful
compound
on
my
walks
around
the
barracks
i
often
pass
the
cook
house
and
watch
the
food
being
carried
to
the
mess
room
the
rice
buckets
about
the
size
of
our
water
buckets
are
put
on
a
pole
in
groups
of
six
or
eight
and
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
two
men
there
is
a
line
about
a
square
long
of
these
buckets
and
then
another
long
line
follows
with
trays
of
soup
bowls
tea
is
not
as
a
rule
drunk
with
the
meals
but
after
the
last
grain
of
rice
has
been
chased
from
the
slippery
sides
of
the
bowl
hot
water
is
poured
in
and
sipped
with
loud
appreciation
last
sunday
afternoon
we
had
to
entertain
ten
officers
of
high
rank
and
it
proved
a
regular
lark
their
english
and
our
japanese
got
fatally
twisted
one
man
took
great
pride
in
showing
me
how
much
too
big
his
clothes
were
giving
him
ample
opportunity
to
put
on
several
suits
of
underwear
in
cold
weather
he
said
many
cloth
dese
trusers
hab
no
fit
like
they
were
delighted
with
all
our
foreign
possessions
and
inspected
everything
minutely
on
leaving
one
officer
bowed
low
and
assured
me
that
he
would
never
see
me
on
earth
again
but
he
hoped
he
would
see
me
in
heaven
the
breezes
from
china
waft
an
occasional
despairing
epistle
from
little
germany
but
they
find
me
as
cold
as
a
snow
bank
on
the
north
side
of
a
mountain
the
sun
that
melts
my
heart
will
have
to
rise
in
the
west
and
get
up
early
at
that
hiroshima
may
well
commencement
is
over
and
my
first
class
is
graduated
now
if
you
have
ever
heard
of
anything
more
ridiculous
than
that
please
cable
me
if
you
could
have
seen
me
standing
on
the
platform
dealing
out
diplomas
you
would
have
been
highly
edified
last
night
i
gave
the
class
a
dinner
there
were
fourteen
girls
only
two
of
whom
had
ever
been
at
a
foreign
table
before
at
first
they
were
terribly
embarrassed
but
before
long
they
warmed
up
to
the
occasion
and
got
terribly
tickled
over
their
awkwardness
i
was
afraid
they
would
knock
their
teeth
out
with
the
knives
and
forks
and
the
feat
of
getting
soup
from
the
spoon
to
the
mouth
proved
so
difficult
that
i
let
them
drink
it
from
the
bowl
sitting
in
chairs
was
as
hard
for
them
as
sitting
on
the
floor
for
me
so
between
the
courses
we
had
a
kind
of
cake
walk
next
week
school
begins
again
and
i
start
three
new
kindergartens
making
seven
over
which
i
have
supervision
i
am
so
pleased
over
the
progress
of
my
work
that
i
do
know
what
to
do
not
that
i
realize
my
limitations
heaven
knows
i
do
imagine
my
efforts
at
teaching
the
training
class
psychology
the
other
day
we
were
struggling
with
the
subject
of
reflex
action
and
one
of
the
girls
handed
in
this
definition
as
she
had
understood
it
from
me
reflex
action
is
of
a
activity
nervous
it
is
sometimes
the
do
understand
of
what
it
is
doing
and
stops
many
messages
to
the
brain
and
sends
the
motion
to
the
legs
what
little
knowledge
i
start
with
gets
before
i
get
through
the
japanese
can
twist
the
english
language
into
some
of
the
strangest
knots
that
you
ever
saw
there
is
a
sign
quite
near
here
that
reads
cows
milk
and
retailed
since
writing
you
last
i
have
sent
my
little
sick
girl
home
it
almost
broke
us
all
up
but
she
could
stay
here
alone
during
the
summer
and
there
was
nobody
to
take
care
of
her
i
write
to
her
every
week
and
try
to
keep
her
cheered
up
but
for
such
as
she
there
is
only
one
release
and
that
is
death
if
jack
hospital
ever
materializes
i
am
going
to
offer
my
services
as
a
nurse
this
poor
child
plight
has
taken
such
a
hold
upon
me
that
i
long
to
do
something
for
all
the
sick
waifs
in
creation
hiroshima
june
it
is
sunday
afternoon
and
your
foreign
missionary
kindergarten
teacher
instead
of
trudging
off
to
sunday
school
with
the
other
teachers
is
recklessly
sitting
in
dressing
gown
and
slippers
with
her
golden
hair
hanging
down
her
hack
writing
letters
home
after
teaching
all
week
and
listening
for
two
hours
to
a
japanese
sermon
sunday
morning
i
cross
my
fingers
on
teaching
sunday
school
in
the
afternoon
this
past
week
i
have
been
trying
to
practice
the
simple
life
it
was
a
good
time
for
we
had
spring
cleaning
five
guests
daily
two
new
cooks
and
an
earthquake
i
think
by
the
time
i
get
through
i
be
qualified
to
run
a
government
on
some
small
pacific
isle
the
whole
city
is
in
confusion
ninety
thousand
soldiers
are
here
now
and
eighty
thousand
more
are
expected
this
week
every
must
take
as
many
as
he
can
accommodate
and
the
strain
on
the
people
is
heavy
we
heard
yesterday
of
the
terrible
disaster
to
the
troops
that
left
here
on
the
three
transports
were
sunk
by
the
russians
five
hundred
of
the
wounded
from
south
hill
battle
have
been
brought
here
and
whenever
i
go
out
i
see
long
lines
of
stretchers
and
covered
ambulances
bringing
in
more
men
it
is
intolerable
to
be
near
so
much
suffering
and
not
to
be
able
to
relieve
it
we
are
all
so
worked
up
with
pity
and
indignation
and
sympathy
that
we
hardly
dare
talk
about
the
war
summer
vacation
will
soon
be
here
and
i
am
planning
a
wild
career
of
self
indulgence
i
am
going
to
karuizawa
where
i
can
get
cooled
off
and
rested
and
invite
my
soul
to
my
heart
content
for
two
mortal
weeks
the
rain
has
poured
in
torrents
the
rainy
season
out
here
is
any
of
your
nice
polite
little
affairs
it
is
just
one
interminable
downpour
until
the
old
earth
is
spanked
into
submission
i
ca
even
remember
how
sunshine
looks
and
my
spirits
are
mildewed
and
my
courage
is
mouldy
to
add
to
the
discomfort
we
are
besieged
by
mosquitoes
they
are
the
big
ferocious
kind
that
carry
off
a
finger
at
a
time
i
heard
of
one
missionary
down
in
the
country
who
was
so
bothered
one
night
that
he
hung
his
trousers
to
the
ceiling
and
put
his
head
in
one
leg
and
made
his
wife
put
her
head
in
the
other
while
the
rest
of
the
garment
served
as
a
breathing
tube
it
has
been
nearly
a
year
since
i
was
out
of
hiroshima
a
year
of
such
ups
and
downs
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
digging
out
my
salvation
with
a
not
that
i
do
not
enjoy
the
struggle
real
life
with
all
its
knocks
and
bumps
its
joys
and
sorrows
is
vastly
preferable
to
a
passive
existence
of
indolence
only
occasionally
i
look
forward
to
the
time
when
i
shall
be
an
angel
frivoling
in
the
eternal
blue
just
think
of
being
reduced
to
a
nice
little
curly
head
and
a
pair
of
wings
the
kind
of
angel
i
am
going
to
be
with
no
legs
to
ache
and
no
heart
to
break
but
dear
me
it
is
more
than
likely
that
i
will
get
rheumatism
in
my
wings
if
ever
i
do
get
to
heaven
it
will
be
on
your
ladder
mate
you
have
coaxed
me
up
with
confidence
and
praise
you
have
steadied
me
with
ethical
culture
books
and
essays
and
sermons
you
have
gotten
me
so
far
up
for
me
that
i
am
afraid
to
look
down
i
shrink
with
a
mighty
shrivel
when
i
think
of
disappointing
you
in
any
way
and
i
expand
almost
to
bursting
when
i
think
of
justifying
your
belief
in
me
karuizawa
july
here
i
am
comfortably
established
in
the
most
curious
sort
of
house
you
ever
saw
the
front
part
is
all
japanese
and
faces
on
one
street
and
the
back
part
is
foreign
and
faces
on
another
street
a
square
away
the
two
are
connected
by
a
covered
walk
which
passes
over
a
mill
race
in
the
floor
of
the
walk
just
over
the
water
is
a
trap
door
and
look
out
when
i
will
i
can
see
the
japanese
stopping
to
take
a
bath
in
this
little
opening
i
have
a
nice
big
room
and
so
much
service
thrown
in
that
it
embarrasses
me
when
i
come
in
in
the
evening
three
little
maids
escort
me
to
my
room
one
fixes
the
mosquito
bar
one
gets
my
gown
and
one
helps
to
undress
me
when
they
have
done
all
they
can
think
of
they
get
in
a
row
all
bow
together
then
pitter
patter
away
the
clerk
has
to
make
out
the
menus
and
as
his
english
is
limited
he
calls
upon
me
very
often
to
help
him
yesterday
he
came
with
only
one
entry
and
that
was
corns
on
the
ear
in
return
for
my
assistance
he
always
announces
my
bath
and
escorts
me
to
the
bath
room
carrying
my
sponge
and
towels
as
to
karuizawa
it
has
a
summer
population
of
about
four
hundred
three
hundred
and
of
whom
are
missionaries
let
us
all
unite
in
singing
blest
be
the
tie
that
binds
everybody
at
our
table
is
in
the
mission
field
a
young
preacher
who
sits
opposite
me
looks
as
if
he
had
spent
all
his
life
in
some
kind
of
a
field
he
has
a
terrible
attack
of
religion
i
never
saw
anybody
take
it
any
harder
he
told
me
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
and
for
three
days
he
had
been
consulting
the
lord
about
what
kind
of
a
ring
he
should
buy
sunday
i
went
to
church
and
heard
my
first
english
sermon
in
two
years
we
met
in
a
rough
little
shanty
built
in
a
cluster
of
pines
and
almost
every
nation
was
represented
a
young
english
clergyman
read
the
service
and
afterward
said
a
few
words
about
sacrifice
he
was
simple
and
sincere
and
his
deep
voice
trembled
with
earnestness
as
he
declared
that
sacrifice
was
the
only
true
road
to
happiness
sacrifice
of
ourselves
our
wishes
and
desires
for
the
good
and
the
progress
of
others
and
suddenly
all
the
feeling
in
me
got
on
a
rampage
and
i
wanted
to
get
up
and
say
that
it
was
true
that
i
knew
it
was
true
that
the
most
miserable
pitiful
life
could
blossom
again
if
it
would
only
blossom
for
others
i
walked
home
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
and
at
dinner
the
young
preacher
said
was
a
pity
we
could
have
regular
preaching
there
was
such
a
peart
lot
at
meeting
this
is
certainly
a
good
place
to
study
eccentricities
their
foibles
and
follies
to
hear
them
preach
and
see
them
not
practice
one
more
year
and
i
will
be
home
something
almost
stops
in
my
heart
as
i
write
it
of
course
i
am
glad
you
are
going
abroad
in
the
spring
you
have
been
living
on
the
prospect
of
seeing
italy
all
your
life
only
mate
i
am
selfish
enough
to
want
you
back
by
the
time
i
get
home
it
would
take
just
one
perfect
hour
of
seeing
you
all
together
once
more
to
banish
the
loneliness
of
all
these
years
i
am
glad
jack
and
leet
have
struck
up
such
a
friendship
jack
uses
about
the
same
care
in
selecting
a
friend
that
most
men
do
in
selecting
a
wife
tell
leet
that
i
am
glad
he
found
me
in
a
pigeon
hole
of
his
memory
but
that
i
am
a
long
way
from
being
the
bunch
of
mischief
he
describes
i
wish
you
would
tell
him
that
i
am
slender
pale
and
pensive
with
a
glamour
of
romance
and
mystery
hovering
about
me
that
is
the
way
i
would
like
to
be
i
knew
you
could
get
jack
out
of
his
rut
if
you
tried
the
browning
evenings
must
be
highly
diverting
i
can
imagine
you
reading
a
few
lines
for
him
to
expound
then
him
reading
a
few
for
you
to
explain
then
both
gazing
into
space
with
the
infinite
cry
of
finite
hearts
that
yearn
dear
loyal
old
jack
how
memories
stab
me
as
i
think
of
him
it
seems
impossible
to
think
of
him
as
other
than
well
and
strong
and
self
reliant
what
happy
happy
days
i
have
spent
with
him
they
seem
to
stand
out
in
one
great
white
spot
of
cheerfulness
when
the
days
were
the
darkest
and
i
could
see
one
inch
ahead
jack
would
happen
along
with
a
funny
story
or
a
joke
would
pretend
not
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
do
some
little
kindness
that
would
brighten
the
way
a
bit
what
a
mixture
he
is
of
tenderness
and
brusqueness
of
common
sense
and
poetry
of
fun
and
seriousness
i
think
you
and
i
are
the
only
ones
in
the
world
who
quite
understand
his
heights
and
depths
he
says
even
i
do
karuizawa
july
since
writing
you
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
looking
six
hundred
feet
down
the
throat
of
asamayama
the
great
volcano
if
the
old
lady
had
been
impolite
enough
to
stick
out
her
tongue
i
would
at
present
be
a
cinder
we
started
at
seven
in
the
evening
on
horseback
now
as
you
know
i
have
ridden
pretty
much
everything
from
a
broom
stick
to
a
camel
but
for
absolute
novelty
of
motion
commend
me
to
a
japanese
horse
there
is
a
lurch
to
larboard
then
a
lurch
to
starboard
with
a
sort
of
interlude
a
coolie
walks
at
the
head
of
each
horse
and
reasons
softly
with
him
when
he
misbehaves
we
rode
for
thirteen
miles
to
the
foot
of
the
volcano
then
at
one
we
left
the
horses
with
one
of
the
men
and
began
to
climb
each
climber
was
tied
to
a
coolie
whose
duty
it
was
to
pull
and
to
carry
the
lantern
we
made
a
weird
procession
and
the
strange
call
of
the
coolies
as
they
bent
their
bodies
to
the
task
mingled
with
the
laughter
and
exclamations
of
the
party
for
some
miles
the
pine
trees
and
undergrowth
covered
the
mountain
then
came
a
stretch
of
utter
and
isolation
miles
above
yet
seemingly
close
enough
to
touch
rose
tongues
of
flame
and
crimson
smoke
above
was
the
majestic
serenity
of
the
summer
night
below
the
peaceful
valley
with
the
twinkling
lights
of
far
away
villages
it
was
a
queer
sensation
to
be
hanging
thus
between
earth
and
sky
and
to
feel
that
the
only
thing
between
me
and
death
was
a
small
japanese
coolie
who
was
half
dragging
me
up
a
mountain
side
that
was
so
straight
it
was
when
at
last
we
reached
the
top
daylight
was
showing
faintly
in
the
east
slowly
and
with
a
glory
unspeakable
the
sun
rose
the
great
flames
and
crimson
smoke
which
at
night
had
appeared
so
dazzling
sank
into
insignificance
if
anyone
has
the
temerity
to
doubt
the
existence
of
a
gracious
mighty
god
let
him
stand
at
sunrise
on
the
top
of
asamayama
and
behold
the
wonder
of
his
works
i
hardly
dared
to
breathe
for
fear
i
would
dispel
the
illusion
but
a
hearty
lunch
eaten
with
the
edge
of
the
crater
for
a
table
made
things
seem
pretty
real
the
coming
down
was
fearful
for
the
ashes
were
very
deep
and
we
often
went
in
up
to
our
knees
the
next
morning
at
eleven
i
rolled
into
my
bed
more
dead
than
alive
my
face
and
hands
were
blistered
from
the
heat
and
the
ashes
and
i
was
sore
from
head
to
foot
but
i
had
a
vision
in
my
soul
that
can
never
be
effaced
hiroshima
september
well
here
i
am
back
in
i
used
to
think
it
stood
for
that
too
but
it
does
curiously
enough
i
rather
enjoy
getting
back
into
harness
this
year
three
kindergartens
to
attend
in
the
morning
class
work
in
the
afternoon
four
separate
accounts
to
be
kept
besides
housekeeping
mothers
meetings
and
prayer
meetings
would
have
appalled
me
once
the
only
thing
that
phases
me
is
the
company
if
only
some
nice
accommodating
cyclone
would
come
along
and
gather
up
all
the
floating
population
and
deposit
it
in
a
neat
pile
in
some
distant
fence
corner
i
would
be
everlastingly
grateful
one
loving
brother
wrote
last
week
that
he
was
coming
with
a
wife
and
three
children
to
board
with
us
until
his
house
was
completed
and
that
he
knew
i
would
be
glad
to
have
them
delighted
i
am
sure
all
i
need
to
complete
my
checkered
career
is
to
keep
a
i
smacked
susie
damn
clear
down
the
steps
and
sang
a
consecrated
bear
then
i
wrote
him
to
come
it
is
against
the
principles
of
the
school
to
refuse
anyone
its
hospitality
consequently
everybody
who
is
out
of
a
job
comes
to
see
us
the
waves
of
my
wrath
break
upon
miss
lessing
for
allowing
herself
to
be
imposed
upon
but
she
is
as
calm
and
serene
as
the
great
buddha
of
kamakura
my
special
grievance
this
morning
is
cooked
tomatoes
and
baby
organs
our
cook
has
just
discovered
cooked
tomatoes
and
they
seem
to
fill
some
longfelt
want
in
his
soul
in
spite
of
protest
he
serves
them
to
us
for
breakfast
tiffin
and
dinner
and
the
household
sits
with
injured
countenance
and
silently
holds
me
responsible
as
for
the
nine
and
one
wind
bags
that
begin
their
wheezing
and
squeaking
before
breakfast
my
thoughts
are
unfit
for
publication
this
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
strains
shall
we
meet
beyond
the
river
well
if
we
do
the
keys
will
fly
that
all
there
is
about
it
once
in
a
while
they
it
to
oh
to
be
nothing
nothing
that
is
where
i
fully
agree
and
if
they
would
only
give
me
a
chance
i
would
grant
their
desire
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
i
am
sure
my
hades
will
be
a
hard
seat
in
a
lonesome
corner
where
i
must
listen
to
baby
organs
all
day
and
live
on
a
perpetual
diet
of
cooked
tomatoes
they
are
bringing
in
the
wounded
soldiers
from
liaoyang
and
i
try
to
keep
away
from
the
windows
so
i
will
not
see
them
those
bright
strong
boys
that
left
here
such
a
little
while
ago
are
coming
back
on
stretchers
crippled
and
disfigured
for
life
yesterday
while
taking
a
walk
i
saw
about
two
hundred
men
right
off
the
transport
waiting
for
the
doctors
and
nurses
to
come
men
whose
clothes
had
not
been
changed
for
weeks
ragged
bloody
and
soiled
beyond
conception
wounded
tired
sick
with
almost
every
trace
of
the
human
gone
out
of
their
faces
they
sat
or
lay
on
the
ground
waiting
to
be
cared
for
most
of
the
wounds
had
not
been
touched
since
they
were
hastily
tied
up
on
the
battlefield
i
thought
i
had
some
idea
of
what
war
meant
but
i
had
the
faintest
conception
of
the
real
horror
of
it
miss
lessing
is
trying
to
get
permission
for
us
to
do
regular
visiting
at
the
hospitals
but
the
officials
are
very
cautious
about
allowing
any
foreigner
behind
the
scenes
just
here
i
hung
my
head
out
of
the
window
to
ask
the
cook
what
time
it
was
he
called
back
me
no
know
clock
him
gone
to
sleep
he
no
talk
some
more
i
think
i
shall
follow
the
example
of
the
clock
hiroshima
october
dearest
mate
i
have
been
to
the
hospital
at
last
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
see
nothing
and
talk
of
nothing
but
those
poor
battered
up
men
yesterday
the
authorities
sent
word
that
if
the
foreign
teachers
would
come
and
make
a
little
music
for
the
sick
men
it
would
be
appreciated
we
had
no
musical
instrument
except
the
organ
so
miss
lessing
and
i
bundled
one
up
on
a
jinrikisha
and
trudged
along
beside
it
through
the
street
i
got
almost
hysterical
over
our
absurd
appearance
and
pretended
that
miss
lessing
was
the
organ
grinder
and
i
the
monkey
but
oh
mate
when
we
got
to
the
hospital
all
the
silliness
was
knocked
out
of
me
thousands
of
mutilated
and
dying
men
literally
shot
to
pieces
by
the
russian
bullets
i
ca
talk
about
it
it
was
too
horrible
to
describe
we
wheeled
the
organ
into
one
of
the
wards
and
two
of
the
teachers
sang
while
i
played
it
was
pitiful
to
see
how
eager
the
men
were
to
hear
the
room
was
so
big
that
those
in
the
back
begged
to
be
moved
closer
so
the
little
nurses
carried
the
convalescent
ones
forward
on
their
backs
for
one
hour
i
pumped
away
on
that
wheezy
little
old
instrument
with
the
tears
running
down
my
cheeks
most
of
the
time
so
long
as
i
live
i
never
make
fun
of
a
baby
organ
again
the
joy
that
one
gave
that
afternoon
justified
its
being
and
then
prepare
for
the
worst
we
distributed
tracts
oh
yes
i
did
it
too
in
spite
of
all
the
fun
i
have
made
and
would
you
believe
it
those
men
who
were
able
to
walk
crowded
around
and
for
them
and
the
others
in
the
beds
held
out
their
hands
or
followed
us
wistfully
with
their
eyes
they
were
so
crazy
for
something
to
read
that
they
were
even
willing
to
read
about
the
foreign
god
it
was
late
when
we
got
back
and
i
went
straight
to
bed
and
indulged
in
a
chill
all
the
horror
of
war
had
come
home
to
me
for
the
first
time
and
my
very
soul
rebelled
against
it
they
say
you
get
hardened
to
the
sights
after
a
few
visits
to
the
hospital
but
i
hope
i
shall
never
get
to
the
point
of
believing
that
it
right
for
strong
useful
men
to
be
killed
or
crippled
for
life
in
order
to
settle
a
controversy
before
we
went
into
the
wards
the
physician
in
charge
took
us
all
over
the
buildings
showed
us
where
the
old
bandages
were
being
washed
and
cleaned
where
the
instruments
were
sharpened
and
repaired
where
the
stretchers
and
crutches
and
first
aid
to
the
injured
satchels
were
kept
we
were
taken
through
the
postoffice
where
all
the
mail
comes
and
goes
from
the
front
it
was
touching
to
see
the
number
of
letters
that
had
been
sent
home
unopened
twenty
thousand
sick
soldiers
are
cared
for
in
hiroshima
and
such
system
such
cleanliness
and
order
you
have
never
seen
i
have
wished
for
jack
a
thousand
times
it
would
delight
his
soul
to
see
the
skill
and
ability
of
these
wonderful
little
doctors
and
nurses
hiroshima
november
it
will
be
four
weeks
since
i
have
had
any
kind
of
mail
from
america
it
seems
to
me
that
everything
has
stopped
running
across
the
ocean
even
the
waves
i
know
little
these
days
outside
of
the
kindergarten
and
the
hospital
the
former
grows
cuter
and
dearer
all
the
time
it
is
a
constant
inspiration
to
see
the
daily
development
of
these
cunning
babies
as
for
the
visits
to
the
hospital
they
are
a
task
that
grows
no
easier
through
repetition
you
know
how
i
shrink
from
seeing
pain
and
how
all
my
life
i
have
tried
to
get
away
from
the
disagreeable
well
it
is
like
torture
to
go
day
after
day
into
the
midst
of
the
most
terrible
suffering
but
in
view
of
the
bigger
things
of
life
the
tremendous
struggle
going
on
so
near
the
agony
of
the
sick
and
wounded
the
suffering
of
the
women
and
children
my
own
little
qualms
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
and
my
one
consuming
desire
is
to
help
in
any
way
i
can
last
week
we
took
in
addition
to
the
wind
bag
two
big
baskets
of
flowers
to
give
to
the
sickest
ones
oh
if
i
could
only
make
you
know
what
flowers
mean
to
them
men
too
sick
to
raise
their
heads
and
often
dying
will
stretch
out
their
hands
for
a
flower
and
be
perfectly
content
to
hold
it
in
their
fingers
one
soldier
with
both
arms
gone
asked
me
for
a
flower
just
as
i
had
emptied
my
basket
i
would
have
given
my
month
salary
for
one
rose
but
all
i
had
was
a
withered
little
pansy
he
motioned
for
me
to
give
him
that
and
asked
me
to
put
it
in
a
broken
bottle
hanging
on
the
wall
so
he
could
see
it
if
i
did
get
away
from
it
all
once
in
a
while
i
do
believe
i
could
stand
it
yesterday
was
the
emperor
birthday
and
we
had
a
holiday
i
took
several
of
the
girls
and
went
for
a
long
ramble
in
the
country
the
fields
were
a
brilliant
yellow
rich
and
heavy
with
the
unharvested
grain
the
mountains
were
deeply
purple
and
the
sky
so
tenderly
blue
that
the
whole
world
just
seemed
a
place
to
be
glad
and
happy
in
fall
in
japan
does
not
suggest
death
and
decay
but
rather
the
drifting
into
a
beautiful
rest
where
dreams
can
be
dreamed
and
the
world
forgot
such
a
spirit
of
peace
enveloped
the
whole
scene
that
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
the
long
line
of
black
objects
on
the
distant
road
were
stretchers
bearing
the
sick
and
wounded
from
the
transports
to
the
hospitals
hiroshima
december
last
saturday
i
had
to
go
across
the
bay
to
visit
one
of
our
branch
kindergartens
many
russian
prisoners
are
stationed
on
the
island
and
i
was
tremendously
interested
in
the
good
time
they
were
having
the
japanese
officials
are
entertaining
them
violently
with
concerts
picnics
etc
imagine
a
lot
of
these
big
muscular
men
being
sent
on
an
excursion
with
two
little
japanese
guards
of
course
it
is
practically
impossible
for
the
men
to
escape
from
the
island
but
i
do
believe
they
want
to
a
cook
has
actually
been
brought
from
vladivostock
so
that
they
may
have
russian
food
and
the
best
things
in
the
markets
are
sent
to
them
the
prisoners
i
saw
seemed
in
high
spirits
and
were
having
as
much
fun
as
a
lot
of
school
boys
out
on
a
lark
i
do
wonder
it
is
lots
more
comfortable
being
a
prisoner
in
japan
than
a
soldier
in
manchuria
i
only
had
a
few
minutes
to
visit
the
hospital
but
i
was
glad
i
went
as
the
doctor
took
me
through
one
of
the
wards
where
the
sickest
men
lay
i
saw
one
big
rough
looking
russian
with
such
a
scowl
on
his
face
that
i
hardly
dared
offer
him
my
small
posy
but
i
hated
to
pass
him
by
so
i
ventured
to
lay
it
on
the
foot
of
the
cot
what
was
my
consternation
when
after
one
glance
he
clasped
both
hands
over
his
face
and
sobbed
like
a
sick
child
are
you
in
pain
asked
the
doctor
no
he
said
shortly
i
homesick
oh
mate
that
finished
me
did
i
know
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
how
he
felt
i
just
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
cot
and
patted
him
and
tried
to
tell
him
how
sorry
i
was
though
he
could
hardly
understand
a
word
this
morning
i
could
have
done
a
song
and
dance
when
i
heard
that
he
had
been
operated
on
and
was
to
be
sent
home
almost
every
day
we
are
having
grand
military
funerals
and
they
are
most
impressive
i
can
tell
you
yesterday
officers
were
buried
at
the
same
time
and
the
school
stood
on
the
street
for
over
an
hour
to
do
them
honor
the
procession
was
very
interesting
with
the
buddhist
priests
in
their
gorgeous
robes
and
the
mourners
in
white
or
light
blue
first
came
the
square
box
with
the
cremated
remains
then
the
officer
horse
then
coolies
carrying
small
trees
which
were
to
be
planted
on
the
grave
next
came
a
large
picture
of
the
deceased
and
perhaps
his
coat
or
sword
next
the
shaven
priests
in
magnificent
raiment
and
last
the
mourners
carrying
small
trays
with
rice
cakes
to
be
placed
upon
the
grave
the
wives
and
mothers
and
daughters
rode
in
jinrikishas
hand
folded
meekly
in
hand
and
eyes
downcast
such
calm
resigned
faces
i
have
never
seen
many
white
and
wasted
with
sorrow
but
under
absolute
control
of
the
entire
number
only
one
gave
vent
to
her
grief
a
bent
old
woman
with
thin
grey
hair
cut
close
to
her
head
rode
with
both
hands
over
her
face
she
had
lost
two
sons
in
one
battle
and
the
cry
of
her
human
heart
was
stronger
than
any
precept
of
her
religion
hiroshima
december
you
remember
the
irishman
saying
that
we
could
be
pretty
comfortable
in
life
if
it
was
for
our
pleasures
well
i
could
get
along
rather
well
in
japan
were
it
not
for
the
merry
christmases
such
a
terrible
longing
seizes
me
for
my
loved
ones
and
for
god
country
that
i
feel
like
a
needle
near
a
magnet
but
next
christmas
i
just
go
right
up
in
the
air
when
i
think
about
it
this
school
of
life
is
a
difficult
one
at
best
but
when
a
weak
sister
like
myself
is
put
about
three
grades
higher
than
she
belongs
it
is
more
than
hard
i
do
care
a
rap
for
the
struggle
and
the
heart
aches
if
i
have
only
made
good
when
i
came
out
there
were
two
kindergartens
now
there
are
nine
besides
a
big
training
class
anybody
else
could
have
done
as
much
for
the
work
but
one
thing
is
certain
the
work
could
have
done
for
anyone
else
what
it
has
done
for
me
outwardly
i
am
the
same
as
of
old
but
there
is
a
big
change
inside
mate
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
i
am
coming
to
take
the
slaps
of
fate
very
much
as
i
used
to
take
the
curling
of
my
hair
with
a
hot
iron
it
pulled
and
sometimes
burned
but
i
did
care
so
long
as
it
was
going
to
improve
my
looks
so
now
i
use
my
crosses
as
sort
of
curling
irons
for
my
character
your
sudden
decision
to
give
up
your
trip
to
europe
this
spring
set
me
guessing
i
ca
imagine
after
all
your
planning
and
your
dreams
what
could
have
changed
your
mind
so
completely
you
do
seem
to
care
a
rap
about
going
now
look
here
mate
i
want
a
full
report
you
have
turned
all
the
pockets
of
my
confidence
inside
out
what
about
yours
have
you
been
getting
an
aim
in
life
are
you
going
to
be
an
operatic
singer
or
a
temperance
lecturer
or
anything
like
that
you
are
so
horribly
high
minded
that
i
am
prepared
for
the
worst
i
wish
it
would
stop
raining
the
mountains
are
hid
by
a
heavy
gray
mist
and
the
drip
drip
of
the
rain
from
roof
and
trees
is
not
a
cheering
sound
i
am
doing
my
best
to
keep
things
bright
within
i
have
built
a
big
fire
in
my
grate
and
in
my
heart
i
have
lighted
all
the
lamps
at
my
little
shrines
and
i
am
burning
incense
to
the
loves
that
were
and
are
just
after
tiffin
the
rain
stopped
for
a
little
while
and
i
rushed
out
for
a
walk
i
had
been
reading
the
christmas
carol
all
morning
and
it
brought
so
many
memories
of
home
that
i
was
feeling
rather
wobbly
my
walk
set
me
up
immensely
a
baldheaded
toothless
old
man
stopped
me
and
asked
me
where
i
was
coming
when
i
told
him
he
said
that
was
wonderful
and
he
hoped
i
would
have
a
good
time
a
woman
with
a
child
on
her
back
ran
out
and
stopped
me
to
ask
if
i
would
please
let
the
baby
see
my
hair
half
a
dozen
children
and
two
dogs
followed
me
all
the
way
and
an
old
man
and
woman
leaned
against
a
wall
and
laughed
aloud
because
a
foreigner
was
so
funny
to
look
at
if
anyone
thinks
that
he
can
indulge
in
a
nice
private
case
of
the
blues
while
taking
a
walk
in
japan
he
deceives
himself
i
started
out
feeling
like
napoleon
at
helena
and
i
came
home
cheerful
and
ravenously
hungry
i
have
been
trying
to
read
poetry
this
winter
but
i
do
make
much
progress
the
truth
is
i
have
gained
five
pounds
and
i
am
afraid
i
am
getting
too
fat
i
never
knew
but
one
fat
person
to
appreciate
poetry
and
he
crocheted
tidies
by
the
way
i
have
learned
to
knit
you
see
there
are
so
many
times
when
i
have
to
play
the
gracious
hostess
when
i
feel
like
a
volcano
within
that
i
decided
to
get
something
on
which
i
could
vent
my
restlessness
it
is
astonishing
how
much
bad
temper
one
can
knit
into
a
garment
i
do
know
yet
what
mine
is
going
to
be
probably
an
opera
bonnet
for
susie
damn
kyoto
december
you
are
not
any
more
surprised
to
hear
from
me
in
kyoto
than
i
am
to
be
here
one
of
the
teachers
here
a
great
splendid
woman
knowing
that
i
was
interested
in
the
sick
soldiers
asked
me
to
come
up
for
a
week
and
help
the
red
cross
nurses
for
six
days
we
have
met
all
the
trains
and
given
hot
tea
and
books
to
both
the
men
who
were
going
to
the
front
and
to
those
who
were
being
brought
home
we
work
side
by
side
with
buddhist
priests
ladies
of
rank
and
coolies
serving
from
one
to
four
hundred
men
in
fifteen
minutes
you
never
saw
such
a
scrimmage
everybody
works
like
mad
while
the
train
stops
and
the
wild
banzais
that
greet
us
as
the
men
catch
sight
of
the
hot
tea
show
us
how
welcome
it
is
but
the
sights
mate
dear
are
enough
to
break
one
heart
i
have
seen
and
partings
until
i
have
an
emotion
left
one
man
i
talked
with
was
going
back
for
the
fourth
time
having
been
wounded
and
sent
home
again
and
again
his
wife
never
took
her
eyes
from
his
face
until
the
train
pulled
out
and
the
smile
with
which
she
sent
him
away
was
more
heart
rending
than
any
tears
i
ever
saw
then
i
have
been
touched
by
an
old
man
and
his
wife
who
for
four
days
have
met
every
train
to
tell
their
only
son
they
are
so
feeble
that
they
have
to
be
helped
up
and
down
the
steps
and
as
each
train
comes
and
goes
and
their
boy
is
not
on
board
they
totter
hand
in
hand
back
to
the
street
corner
to
wait
more
long
hours
going
one
way
the
trains
carry
the
soldiers
to
the
front
boys
for
the
most
part
wild
with
enthusiasm
high
spirits
and
courage
and
coming
the
other
way
in
vastly
greater
numbers
are
the
silent
trains
bearing
the
sick
and
wounded
and
dead
we
meet
five
trains
during
the
day
and
one
at
two
in
the
night
i
have
gotten
so
that
i
can
sleep
sitting
upright
on
a
hard
bench
between
trains
think
of
the
plucky
little
japanese
women
who
have
done
this
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
out
of
my
experience
at
the
station
came
another
very
charming
one
yesterday
it
seems
that
the
president
of
the
red
cross
society
is
a
royal
princess
first
cousin
indeed
to
the
emperor
she
had
heard
of
me
through
her
secretary
and
of
the
small
services
i
had
rendered
here
and
at
hiroshima
so
she
requested
an
interview
that
she
might
thank
me
in
person
it
seemed
very
ridiculous
that
i
should
receive
formal
recognition
for
pouring
tea
and
handing
out
posies
but
i
was
crazy
to
see
the
princess
so
early
yesterday
morning
i
donned
my
best
raiment
and
sallied
forth
with
an
interpreter
the
house
was
a
regular
chinese
puzzle
and
i
was
passed
on
from
one
person
to
another
until
i
got
positively
dizzy
at
last
we
came
to
a
long
beautiful
room
at
the
end
of
which
in
a
robe
of
purple
and
gold
all
covered
with
white
chrysanthemums
sat
the
royal
lady
i
was
preparing
to
make
my
lowest
bow
when
to
my
astonishment
she
came
forward
with
extended
hand
and
spoke
to
me
in
english
then
she
bowled
me
right
over
in
the
first
round
by
asking
me
about
kindergarten
i
forgot
that
she
was
a
lady
of
royalty
and
numerous
decorations
and
that
etiquette
forbade
me
speaking
except
when
spoken
to
she
was
so
responsive
and
so
interested
that
i
found
myself
talking
in
a
blue
streak
then
she
told
me
a
bit
of
her
story
and
i
longed
to
hear
more
it
seems
that
certain
women
of
the
royal
line
are
not
permitted
to
marry
and
she
being
restless
and
ambitious
became
a
buddhist
priestess
having
her
own
temple
priestesses
etc
the
priestesses
are
all
young
girls
and
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
them
examining
my
clothes
my
hair
and
my
rings
the
princess
herself
is
a
woman
of
brilliant
attainments
and
fine
executive
ability
of
course
we
had
tea
and
sat
on
the
floor
and
chattered
and
laughed
like
a
lot
of
school
girls
when
i
left
i
was
told
that
the
princess
desired
my
photograph
at
once
and
that
i
should
sit
for
it
the
next
day
i
suppose
i
am
in
for
it
hiroshima
december
my
dearest
mate
the
american
mail
is
in
and
the
secret
is
out
or
at
least
out
and
i
am
wild
with
curiosity
and
interest
you
say
you
ca
give
me
any
of
the
particulars
and
you
would
rather
i
would
even
guess
all
that
you
want
me
to
know
is
that
you
have
a
new
interest
in
life
that
is
the
deepest
and
most
beautiful
experience
you
have
ever
known
i
will
do
as
you
request
not
ask
any
questions
or
make
any
surmises
but
you
will
let
me
say
this
that
no
fame
no
glory
no
wealth
can
ever
give
one
thousandth
part
of
the
real
heart
content
that
one
hour
of
love
can
give
without
it
work
of
any
kind
is
against
the
full
tide
and
accomplishment
is
emptier
than
vanity
the
heart
still
cries
out
for
its
own
for
what
is
its
birthright
and
heritage
i
am
glad
with
all
my
soul
for
your
happiness
mate
the
tenderest
blessing
that
lips
could
frame
would
not
express
half
that
is
in
my
heart
there
is
nothing
so
sure
in
life
as
that
love
is
best
of
all
you
think
you
know
it
after
a
few
weeks
of
loving
i
know
i
know
after
years
of
grief
and
suffering
and
despair
from
the
time
when
you
used
to
stand
between
me
and
childish
punishments
through
all
the
happy
days
of
girlhood
the
sorrowful
days
of
womanhood
on
up
to
the
present
you
have
never
failed
me
i
want
to
give
you
a
whole
heart
full
of
gladness
and
rejoicing
i
want
to
crowd
out
my
own
little
wail
of
bereavement
but
oh
mate
i
never
felt
so
alone
in
my
life
before
i
am
not
asking
you
to
tell
me
who
the
man
is
i
am
trying
not
to
tell
me
what
you
like
and
when
you
like
and
rest
assured
that
whatever
comes
my
heart
is
with
you
and
with
him
hiroshima
january
it
has
been
longer
than
usual
since
i
wrote
but
somehow
things
have
been
going
wrong
with
me
of
late
and
i
did
want
to
bother
you
but
oh
mate
i
have
anybody
else
in
the
world
to
come
to
and
have
to
forgive
me
for
bringing
a
cloud
across
your
happiness
the
whole
truth
is
i
worsted
the
fight
has
been
too
much
days
weeks
months
of
homesickness
have
piled
up
on
top
of
me
until
all
my
courage
and
my
control
all
my
seem
paralysed
night
after
night
i
lie
awake
and
stare
out
into
the
dark
and
staring
back
at
me
is
the
one
word
in
the
daytime
i
try
to
keep
somebody
with
me
all
the
time
i
have
gotten
afraid
of
myself
my
face
in
the
mirror
does
not
seem
to
belong
to
me
it
is
a
curious
unfamiliar
face
that
i
do
not
know
every
once
in
a
while
i
want
to
beat
the
air
and
scream
but
i
do
do
it
i
clench
my
fists
and
set
my
teeth
and
teach
teach
teach
but
i
ca
go
on
like
this
forever
flesh
and
spirit
rebel
against
a
lifetime
of
it
have
i
paid
my
penalty
are
the
lightness
and
brightness
and
beauty
ever
coming
back
on
my
desk
is
a
contract
waiting
to
be
signed
for
another
four
years
at
the
school
beside
it
is
a
letter
from
brother
begging
me
to
drop
everything
and
come
home
at
once
can
you
guess
what
the
temptation
is
on
the
one
hand
ceaseless
work
uncongenial
surroundings
and
exile
on
the
other
luxury
loved
ones
and
dependence
i
must
give
my
answer
and
heaven
only
knows
what
it
will
be
one
thing
is
certain
i
am
tired
of
doing
hard
things
i
am
tired
of
being
brave
it
is
storming
fearfully
but
i
am
going
out
to
mail
this
letter
if
i
cable
that
i
am
coming
you
must
be
the
first
one
to
know
why
i
have
tried
to
grow
into
something
higher
and
better
god
knows
i
have
but
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
house
built
on
the
sands
after
all
do
be
hard
on
me
mate
whatever
comes
remember
i
have
tried
hiroshima
hours
later
if
you
open
this
letter
first
do
read
the
one
that
comes
in
the
same
mail
i
wrote
it
this
afternoon
and
i
would
give
everything
i
possess
to
get
it
back
again
when
i
went
out
to
mail
it
i
was
feeling
so
utterly
desperate
that
i
did
care
a
rap
for
the
storm
or
anything
else
i
went
on
and
on
until
i
came
to
the
that
makes
a
big
curve
out
into
the
sea
when
i
had
gone
as
far
as
i
dared
i
climbed
up
on
an
old
stone
lantern
and
let
the
spray
and
the
rain
beat
on
my
face
the
wind
was
whipping
the
waves
into
a
perfect
fury
and
pounding
them
against
the
wall
at
my
feet
the
thunder
rolled
and
roared
and
great
flashes
of
lightning
ripped
gashes
in
the
green
and
purple
water
it
was
the
most
glorious
sight
i
ever
saw
i
felt
that
the
wind
the
waves
and
the
storm
were
all
my
friends
and
that
they
were
doing
all
my
beating
and
screaming
for
me
i
clung
to
the
lantern
with
my
clothes
dripping
and
my
hair
streaming
about
my
face
until
the
storm
was
over
and
i
do
think
i
was
ever
so
near
to
god
in
my
life
as
when
the
sun
came
out
suddenly
from
the
clouds
and
lit
up
that
sea
into
a
perfect
glory
of
light
and
color
i
and
the
peace
had
come
into
my
heart
mate
and
i
knew
that
i
was
going
to
take
up
my
cross
again
and
bear
it
bravely
i
was
so
glad
so
thankful
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
feet
on
the
ground
i
struck
out
at
full
speed
along
the
sea
wall
and
ran
every
step
of
the
way
home
and
now
after
a
hot
bath
and
dry
clothes
with
my
little
kettle
singing
by
my
side
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
decided
to
stay
perhaps
for
five
months
perhaps
for
five
years
out
of
the
wreckage
of
my
old
life
i
managed
to
build
a
fairly
respectable
craft
it
has
taken
me
just
four
years
to
realize
that
it
is
not
a
pleasure
boat
i
realize
once
for
all
that
it
is
a
very
modest
little
tug
and
wherever
it
can
tow
anything
or
anybody
into
harbor
there
it
belongs
and
there
it
stays
tell
them
all
that
i
am
quite
well
again
mate
and
as
for
you
please
do
even
bother
your
blessed
head
about
me
again
i
have
meekly
taken
my
place
in
the
middle
of
the
and
i
shall
probably
never
go
very
high
or
very
low
again
i
am
sleepy
for
the
first
time
in
two
weeks
so
comrade
mine
and
god
bless
you
hiroshima
february
my
dearest
mate
i
ca
feel
quite
right
until
i
tell
you
that
i
have
guessed
your
secret
that
i
have
known
from
the
first
it
was
jack
i
always
knew
you
were
made
for
each
other
both
so
splendid
and
noble
and
true
it
is
any
particular
credit
to
you
two
that
you
are
good
there
was
no
alternative
you
could
be
bad
how
perfectly
you
will
fit
into
all
his
plans
and
ambitions
a
beautiful
new
life
is
opening
up
for
you
a
life
so
full
of
promise
of
tremendous
possibilities
for
good
not
only
for
you
but
for
others
that
it
seems
like
a
bit
of
heaven
tell
him
how
i
feel
mate
it
is
hard
for
me
to
write
letters
these
days
but
i
want
him
to
know
that
i
am
glad
because
he
is
happy
i
have
been
living
in
the
past
going
over
the
old
days
in
the
mountains
up
at
the
lake
and
the
reunions
on
the
farm
how
many
have
gone
down
into
the
great
silence
since
then
somehow
i
seem
nearer
to
them
than
i
do
to
you
who
are
alive
while
i
am
still
on
the
crowded
highway
of
life
yet
i
am
surrounded
by
strange
unloving
faces
that
have
no
connection
with
the
joys
or
the
sorrows
of
the
past
how
the
view
changes
as
we
pass
along
the
great
road
at
first
only
the
hilltops
are
visible
rosy
and
radiant
under
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
then
the
level
plains
come
into
sight
flooded
with
the
bright
light
of
then
slowly
we
slip
into
the
valleys
where
the
long
shadows
fall
like
memories
across
our
hearts
oh
well
with
all
the
struggles
all
the
heartaches
i
am
glad
mate
very
glad
that
i
have
lived
and
laughed
for
i
am
laughing
again
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
my
courage
got
fuddled
and
took
the
wrong
road
i
heard
of
a
man
the
other
day
who
had
received
a
sentence
of
fifteen
years
for
some
criminal
act
he
was
in
love
with
the
freedom
of
life
he
was
young
and
strong
so
he
made
a
dash
down
a
long
iron
staircase
dropped
into
a
river
swam
a
mile
and
gained
his
freedom
all
search
failed
to
find
him
but
two
days
later
he
walked
into
the
police
station
and
gave
himself
up
to
serve
his
time
i
made
my
dash
for
liberty
but
i
have
come
back
to
serve
my
time
i
do
have
to
tell
you
mate
that
i
am
ashamed
of
having
shown
the
white
feather
you
will
write
me
a
beautiful
letter
and
explain
it
all
away
but
i
know
in
my
soul
you
are
disappointed
in
me
and
to
even
think
about
it
is
like
going
down
in
a
swift
elevator
being
able
to
go
under
gracefully
is
my
highest
ambition
at
present
but
try
as
i
will
i
kick
a
few
kicks
before
i
disappear
please
please
mate
do
worry
about
me
i
promise
that
if
i
reach
the
real
limit
i
will
cable
for
a
special
steamer
to
be
sent
for
me
but
i
do
intend
to
reach
it
or
at
least
i
am
going
to
get
on
the
other
side
of
it
so
there
will
be
no
further
danger
two
long
months
will
pass
before
i
get
an
answer
to
this
it
will
come
in
april
with
the
cherry
blossoms
and
the
spring
hiroshima
march
you
must
forgive
me
if
the
letters
have
been
few
and
far
between
lately
after
my
little
wobble
i
plunged
into
work
with
might
and
main
and
i
am
still
at
it
for
all
i
am
worth
first
i
and
the
old
place
must
certainly
be
surprised
at
its
transformation
fresh
curtains
new
paper
cozy
window
seats
and
bright
cushions
have
made
a
vast
difference
then
i
tackled
the
kindergarten
and
the
result
is
about
the
prettiest
thing
in
japan
the
room
is
painted
white
with
buff
walls
and
soft
muslin
curtains
the
only
decoration
being
a
hundred
blessed
babies
in
gay
little
kimonas
who
look
like
big
bunches
of
flowers
placed
in
a
wreath
upon
the
floor
as
for
my
training
class
i
have
no
words
to
express
my
gratification
i
can
scarcely
believe
that
the
fine
capable
earnest
young
women
that
are
going
out
to
all
parts
of
japan
to
start
new
kindergartens
are
the
timid
giggling
dependent
little
creatures
that
came
to
me
four
years
ago
goodness
knows
i
was
as
immature
in
my
way
as
they
were
in
theirs
but
in
my
desperate
need
i
builded
better
than
i
knew
i
recklessly
followed
your
advice
and
hitched
my
little
to
a
star
and
the
star
turned
into
a
meteor
and
is
now
whizzing
through
space
getting
bigger
and
stronger
all
the
time
and
i
am
tied
on
to
the
end
of
it
unable
to
stop
it
or
myself
if
i
only
had
more
sense
and
more
ability
think
what
i
might
have
done
the
work
at
the
hospital
is
still
very
heavy
the
wards
are
bare
and
repellant
and
the
days
are
long
and
dreary
for
the
sick
men
we
do
all
we
can
to
cheer
them
up
have
phonograph
concerts
magic
lantern
shows
with
the
magic
missing
and
baby
organ
recitals
the
results
are
often
ludicrous
but
the
appreciation
of
the
men
for
our
slightest
effort
is
so
hearty
that
it
more
than
repays
us
i
saw
one
man
yesterday
who
had
gone
crazy
on
the
battlefield
he
looked
like
a
terror
stricken
animal
afraid
of
everybody
and
hiding
under
the
sheet
at
the
slightest
approach
when
i
came
in
he
cowered
back
against
the
wall
shaking
from
head
to
foot
i
put
a
big
bunch
of
flowers
on
the
bed
and
in
a
flash
his
hands
were
stretched
out
for
them
and
a
smile
came
to
his
lips
after
that
whenever
i
passed
the
door
he
would
shout
out
arigato
arigato
which
the
nurse
said
was
the
first
sign
of
sanity
he
had
shown
in
the
next
room
was
a
man
who
had
fallen
from
a
mast
on
one
of
the
flag
ships
he
had
landed
full
on
his
face
and
the
result
was
too
fearful
to
describe
the
nurse
said
he
could
not
live
through
the
night
so
i
laid
my
flowers
on
his
bed
and
was
slipping
out
when
he
called
to
me
his
whole
head
was
covered
with
bandages
except
his
mouth
and
one
eye
and
i
had
to
lean
down
very
close
to
understand
what
he
said
what
do
you
suppose
he
wanted
to
look
at
my
hat
he
had
never
seen
one
before
and
he
was
just
like
a
child
in
his
curiosity
of
course
as
foreigners
we
always
excite
comment
and
are
gazed
at
examined
and
talked
about
continually
i
sometimes
feel
like
a
wild
animal
in
a
cage
straight
from
the
heart
of
africa
our
unfailing
point
of
contact
is
the
flowers
you
can
not
imagine
how
they
love
them
i
have
seen
men
holding
them
tenderly
in
their
fingers
and
talking
to
them
as
they
would
to
children
imagine
retreating
soldiers
after
a
hard
day
fight
stopping
to
put
a
flower
in
a
dead
comrade
hand
oh
mate
the
most
comical
things
and
the
most
tragic
the
most
horrible
and
the
most
beautiful
are
all
mixed
up
together
every
time
i
go
to
the
hospital
i
am
faced
with
my
wasted
years
of
opportunities
it
takes
so
little
to
bring
sunshine
and
cheer
and
yet
millions
of
us
go
chasing
our
own
little
desires
through
life
and
never
stop
to
think
of
the
ones
who
are
down
no
i
am
not
going
to
turn
missionary
nor
salvation
army
lassie
but
with
god
help
i
shall
serve
somewhere
and
good
cheer
for
the
lonely
shall
be
my
i
am
lots
better
than
i
was
though
i
am
still
tussling
with
insomnia
my
crazy
nerves
play
me
all
sorts
of
tricks
but
praise
be
i
have
stopped
worrying
i
have
come
at
last
to
see
that
god
has
found
even
a
small
broken
instrument
like
myself
worth
working
through
and
i
just
lift
up
my
heart
to
him
every
day
battered
and
bruised
as
it
is
in
deep
unspeakable
thankfulness
hiroshima
april
my
dearest
mate
your
letter
is
here
and
i
have
a
grain
of
sense
nor
dignity
nor
anything
else
except
a
wild
desire
to
hug
everything
in
sight
i
am
having
as
many
thrills
as
a
surcharged
electric
battery
and
i
am
so
hysterically
happy
that
i
do
care
what
i
do
or
say
why
did
you
tell
me
at
first
it
was
leet
my
mind
was
so
full
of
jack
that
i
forgot
that
other
men
inhabited
the
earth
it
is
no
use
bluffing
any
longer
mate
there
has
never
been
a
minute
since
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
home
station
that
every
instinct
in
me
cried
out
for
jack
pride
kept
me
silent
at
first
and
then
the
miserable
thought
got
hold
of
me
that
he
was
beginning
to
care
for
you
oh
the
agony
i
have
suffered
trying
to
be
loyal
to
you
to
be
generous
to
him
and
to
put
myself
out
of
the
question
and
now
your
blessed
letter
comes
and
laughs
at
my
fears
and
says
jack
chooses
his
wife
as
he
does
his
friends
for
eternity
i
have
no
words
to
fit
the
occasion
all
i
can
say
is
now
that
happiness
has
shown
me
the
back
of
her
head
i
am
scared
to
death
to
look
her
in
the
face
but
i
shore
do
like
the
arrangement
of
her
back
hair
do
breathe
a
word
of
what
i
have
written
but
as
you
love
me
find
out
absolutely
and
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
if
jack
feels
exactly
as
he
did
four
years
ago
if
you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
he
does
then
i
will
write
i
have
signed
a
contract
for
another
year
and
i
must
stay
it
out
but
i
would
spend
a
year
in
hades
if
heaven
was
at
the
end
of
it
all
you
say
about
leet
fills
me
with
joy
he
does
not
need
any
higher
commendation
in
this
world
nor
the
next
than
that
you
are
willing
to
marry
him
is
it
dandy
that
he
is
going
to
back
the
hospital
scheme
when
i
think
of
the
way
jack
has
worked
for
ten
years
without
a
vacation
putting
all
his
magnificent
ability
his
strength
his
youth
his
health
even
into
that
project
i
do
wonder
that
men
like
leet
are
eager
to
put
their
money
and
services
at
his
disposal
you
say
leet
does
it
upon
the
condition
that
jack
takes
a
rest
make
him
stick
to
it
mate
he
will
kill
himself
if
he
is
stopped
i
have
read
your
letters
over
and
over
and
traced
your
love
affair
every
inch
of
the
way
why
are
you
such
an
old
clam
to
think
that
i
am
the
only
one
that
knows
your
secret
and
that
up
to
i
have
been
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
never
mind
i
forgive
you
i
forgive
everybody
i
am
drunk
with
happiness
and
generous
in
consequence
my
little
old
lane
is
glorified
even
the
barbed
wire
fence
on
either
side
scintillates
the
house
is
too
small
i
am
going
out
on
the
river
road
and
see
the
cherry
blossoms
on
the
hill
sides
and
the
sunlight
on
the
water
and
feel
the
road
under
my
feet
i
feel
like
a
prospector
who
has
struck
gold
whatever
comes
of
it
all
for
this
one
day
i
am
going
to
give
full
rein
to
my
fancy
and
be
gloriously
happy
once
more
hiroshima
may
there
is
a
big
yellow
bee
doing
the
buzzing
act
in
the
sunshine
on
my
window
and
i
am
just
wondering
who
is
doing
the
most
buzzing
he
or
i
his
nose
is
yellow
with
pollen
from
some
flower
he
has
robbed
his
body
is
fat
and
lazy
all
in
all
he
is
about
the
happiest
bee
i
ever
beheld
but
i
can
go
him
one
better
while
it
is
only
his
wings
that
are
beating
with
happiness
it
is
my
heart
that
is
going
to
the
tune
of
jigs
and
triumphal
alleluias
all
at
the
same
time
my
chef
four
feet
two
remarked
this
morning
sensei
happy
all
same
like
chicken
he
meant
bird
but
any
old
fowl
will
do
oh
mate
it
is
good
to
be
alive
these
days
for
weeks
we
have
had
nothing
but
glorious
sunrises
gorgeous
sunsets
and
perfect
noondays
the
wistaria
has
come
before
the
cherry
blossoms
have
quite
gone
and
the
earth
is
a
glow
of
purple
and
pink
with
the
blue
sky
above
as
tender
as
love
each
morning
i
open
my
windows
to
the
east
to
see
the
marvel
of
a
new
day
coming
fresh
from
the
hands
of
its
maker
and
each
evening
i
stand
at
the
opposite
window
and
watch
the
same
day
drop
over
the
mountains
to
eternity
in
the
flaming
sky
where
so
often
hangs
the
silver
crescent
is
always
the
promise
of
another
day
another
chance
to
begin
anew
just
one
more
year
and
i
will
be
turning
the
gladdest
face
homeward
that
ever
a
lonely
pilgrim
faced
the
west
with
there
will
be
many
a
pang
at
leaving
japan
i
have
learned
life
deepest
lesson
here
and
the
loneliness
and
isolation
that
have
been
so
hard
to
bear
have
revealed
inner
depths
of
which
i
never
dreamed
before
what
strange
things
human
beings
are
our
very
crosses
get
dear
after
we
have
carried
them
awhile
i
have
had
three
offers
to
sign
fresh
contracts
nagasaki
tokyo
and
here
but
i
am
leaving
things
to
shape
themselves
for
the
future
whatever
happens
i
am
coming
home
first
if
happiness
is
waiting
for
me
i
meet
it
with
arms
if
not
i
am
coming
back
to
my
post
thank
god
i
am
sure
of
myself
at
last
the
work
at
the
hospital
this
month
is
much
lighter
and
the
patients
are
leaving
for
home
daily
the
talk
of
peace
is
in
the
air
and
we
are
praying
with
all
our
hearts
that
it
may
come
nobody
but
those
who
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
can
know
the
unspeakable
horrors
of
this
war
it
is
not
only
those
who
are
fighting
at
the
front
who
have
known
the
full
tragedy
it
is
those
also
who
are
fighting
at
home
the
relentless
foe
of
poverty
sickness
and
desolation
if
victory
comes
to
japan
half
the
glory
must
be
for
those
silent
heroic
little
women
who
gave
their
all
then
took
up
the
man
burden
and
cheerfully
bore
it
to
the
end
i
was
very
much
interested
in
your
account
of
the
young
missionary
who
is
coming
through
japan
on
her
way
to
china
i
know
just
how
she
will
feel
when
she
steps
off
the
steamer
and
finds
no
friendly
face
to
welcome
her
i
talked
over
your
little
scheme
with
miss
lessing
and
she
says
i
can
go
up
to
yokohama
in
july
to
meet
her
and
bring
her
right
down
here
tell
her
to
tie
her
handkerchief
around
her
arm
so
i
will
know
her
and
not
to
worry
the
least
bit
that
i
will
take
care
of
her
and
treat
her
like
one
of
my
own
family
can
you
guess
how
eagerly
i
am
waiting
for
your
answer
to
my
april
letter
it
can
not
come
before
the
last
of
june
and
happy
as
i
am
the
time
seems
very
long
yet
i
would
rather
live
to
the
last
of
my
days
like
this
travelling
ever
toward
the
pot
of
gold
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
than
ever
to
arrive
and
find
the
gold
not
there
you
say
that
at
last
you
know
i
am
the
captain
of
my
soul
well
mate
i
believe
i
am
but
i
just
want
to
say
that
it
a
hard
worked
captain
that
i
am
and
if
anybody
wants
the
job
very
much
i
think
he
can
get
it
yokohama
july
do
you
suppose
if
people
could
they
would
write
letters
as
soon
as
they
got
to
heaven
i
do
know
where
to
begin
nor
what
to
say
the
only
thing
about
me
that
is
on
earth
is
this
pen
point
the
rest
is
floating
around
in
a
mist
i
will
try
to
be
sensible
and
give
you
some
idea
of
what
has
been
happening
but
how
i
am
to
get
it
on
paper
i
do
know
i
got
here
yesterday
the
of
july
on
the
early
train
and
rushed
down
to
the
hatoba
to
meet
the
launch
when
it
came
in
from
the
steamer
i
had
had
no
breakfast
and
was
as
nervous
as
a
witch
your
letter
had
not
come
and
my
fears
were
increasing
every
moment
well
i
took
my
place
on
the
steps
as
the
launch
landed
and
waited
with
very
little
interest
i
must
confess
for
your
young
missionary
to
appear
by
and
by
i
saw
a
handkerchief
tied
to
a
sleeve
but
it
was
a
man
sleeve
i
gave
one
more
look
and
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
jack
i
cried
and
then
everything
went
black
before
me
and
i
did
know
anything
more
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
fainted
sorrow
and
grief
never
knocked
me
out
but
joy
like
that
was
enough
to
kill
me
when
i
came
to
i
was
at
the
hotel
and
i
did
dare
open
my
eyes
i
knew
it
was
all
a
dream
and
i
did
not
want
to
come
back
to
reality
i
lay
there
holding
on
to
the
vision
until
i
heard
a
man
voice
close
by
say
she
will
be
all
right
now
i
will
take
care
of
her
then
i
opened
my
eyes
and
with
three
japanese
maids
and
four
japanese
men
and
two
ladies
off
the
steamer
looking
on
i
flung
my
arms
about
jack
neck
and
cried
down
his
collar
he
made
me
stay
quiet
all
morning
and
just
before
tiffin
he
calmly
informed
me
that
he
had
made
all
the
arrangements
for
us
to
be
married
at
three
i
declared
i
could
that
i
had
signed
a
contract
for
another
year
at
hiroshima
that
miss
lessing
would
think
i
was
crazy
that
i
must
make
some
plans
but
you
know
jack
he
met
every
objection
that
i
could
offer
said
he
would
see
miss
lessing
and
make
it
all
right
about
the
contract
that
i
was
too
nervous
to
teach
any
more
and
last
that
i
owed
him
a
little
consideration
after
four
years
of
waiting
then
i
realized
how
the
lines
had
deepened
in
his
face
and
how
the
grey
was
streaking
his
hair
and
i
surrendered
promptly
we
were
married
in
a
little
english
church
on
the
bluff
with
half
a
dozen
witnesses
several
americans
whom
jack
had
met
on
the
steamer
a
missionary
friend
of
mine
and
the
japanese
clerk
constituted
the
audience
it
is
all
like
a
beautiful
dream
to
me
still
and
i
am
afraid
to
let
jack
get
out
of
my
sight
for
fear
i
will
wake
up
it
was
fourth
of
july
and
christmas
and
birthday
and
wedding
day
all
rolled
into
one
the
whole
city
was
celebrating
the
hotel
a
flutter
of
flags
and
ribbons
the
bay
full
of
every
kind
of
pleasure
craft
at
night
there
was
a
grand
lantern
fete
and
fireworks
and
a
huge
figure
of
uncle
sam
with
stars
in
his
coat
tails
thousands
of
japanese
in
their
gayest
kimonas
thronged
the
bund
listening
to
the
music
watching
the
foreigners
and
the
jack
and
i
were
like
two
children
he
forgot
that
he
was
a
staid
doctor
and
i
forgot
that
i
had
ever
been
a
foreign
missionary
kindergarten
teacher
we
were
boy
and
girl
again
and
up
to
our
eyes
in
love
it
was
the
first
fourth
of
july
for
fifteen
years
that
i
did
not
have
some
unhappiness
to
conceal
as
one
of
my
girls
said
about
herself
my
little
lonely
heart
had
flewed
away
all
the
loneliness
the
heartaches
the
pains
are
justified
now
i
do
not
regret
the
past
for
through
it
the
present
is
do
you
remember
the
lines
he
shall
restore
the
years
that
the
locust
hath
eaten
well
i
believe
that
while
i
have
been
struggling
out
here
he
has
restored
them
and
that
i
will
be
permitted
to
return
to
a
new
life
a
life
given
back
by
god
of
course
you
know
we
are
going
on
around
it
seems
rather
inconsistent
to
say
i
am
glad
of
it
after
all
my
wailing
for
home
the
truth
is
home
has
come
to
jack
says
we
are
to
meet
you
and
leet
in
paris
you
need
try
to
persuade
me
that
heaven
will
be
any
better
than
the
present
there
is
no
use
in
my
trying
to
thank
you
for
your
part
in
all
this
dear
mate
i
have
been
in
a
chronic
state
of
gratitude
to
you
ever
since
i
was
born
i
can
only
say
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
god
bless
you
and
in
my
wedding
ring
is
engraved
can
you
guess
what
it
means
