the

there
were
thirty
or
forty
personally
addressed
letters
the
daily
heritage
of
the
head
of
a
great
business
establishment
and
a
plain
package
about
the
size
of
a
some
three
inches
long
two
inches
wide
and
one
inch
deep
it
was
neatly
tied
with
thin
scarlet
twine
and
innocent
of
markings
except
for
the
superscription
in
a
precise
copperplate
hand
and
the
smudge
of
the
postmark
across
the
stamp
in
the
upper
corner
the
imprint
of
the
cancellation
faintly
decipherable
showed
that
the
package
had
been
mailed
at
the
madison
square
substation
at
seven
of
the
previous
evening
harry
latham
president
and
active
head
of
the
latham
company
manufacturing
jewelers
in
fifth
avenue
found
the
letters
and
the
package
on
his
desk
when
he
entered
his
private
office
a
few
minutes
past
nine
the
simple
fact
that
the
package
bore
no
return
address
or
identifying
mark
of
any
sort
caused
him
to
pick
it
up
and
examine
it
after
which
he
shook
it
inquiringly
then
with
kindling
curiosity
he
snipped
the
scarlet
thread
with
a
pair
of
silver
scissors
and
unfolded
the
wrappings
inside
was
a
glazed
paper
box
such
as
jewelers
use
but
still
there
was
no
mark
no
printing
either
on
top
or
bottom
the
cover
of
the
box
came
off
in
latham
hand
disclosing
a
bed
of
white
cotton
he
removed
the
downy
upper
layer
and
there
there
nestling
against
the
snowy
background
blazed
a
single
splendid
diamond
of
six
perhaps
seven
carats
myriad
colors
played
in
its
depths
sparkling
flashing
dazzling
in
the
subdued
light
latham
drew
one
long
quick
breath
and
walked
over
to
the
window
to
examine
the
stone
in
the
full
glare
of
day
a
minute
or
more
passed
a
minute
of
wonder
admiration
allurement
but
at
last
he
ventured
to
lift
the
diamond
from
the
box
it
was
perfect
so
far
as
he
could
see
perfect
in
cutting
and
color
and
depth
prismatic
radiant
bewilderingly
gorgeous
its
value
even
he
could
not
offer
an
opinion
only
the
appraisement
of
his
expert
would
be
worth
listening
to
on
that
point
but
one
thing
he
knew
instantly
in
the
stock
of
precious
stones
stored
away
in
the
vaults
of
the
latham
company
there
was
not
one
to
compare
with
this
at
length
as
he
stared
at
it
fascinated
he
remembered
that
he
did
know
its
owner
and
for
the
second
time
he
examined
the
wrappings
the
box
inside
and
out
and
finally
he
lifted
out
the
lower
layer
of
cotton
seeking
a
fugitive
card
or
mark
of
some
sort
surely
the
owner
of
so
valuable
a
stone
would
not
be
so
careless
as
to
send
it
this
way
through
the
mail
unregistered
without
some
method
of
identification
another
sharp
scrutiny
of
box
and
cotton
and
wrappings
left
him
in
deep
perplexity
then
another
idea
came
one
of
the
letters
of
course
the
owner
of
the
diamond
had
sent
it
this
way
perhaps
to
be
set
and
had
sent
instructions
under
another
cover
an
absurd
even
a
reckless
thing
to
do
but
and
latham
attacked
the
heap
of
letters
neatly
stacked
up
in
front
of
him
there
were
of
them
but
not
one
even
remotely
hinted
at
diamonds
in
order
to
be
perfectly
sure
latham
went
through
his
mail
a
second
time
perhaps
the
letter
of
instructions
had
come
addressed
to
the
company
and
had
gone
to
the
secretary
flitcroft
he
arose
to
summon
flitcroft
from
an
adjoining
room
then
changed
his
mind
long
enough
carefully
to
replace
the
diamond
in
the
box
and
thrust
the
box
into
a
pigeonhole
of
his
desk
then
he
called
flitcroft
in
have
you
gone
through
your
morning
mail
latham
inquired
of
the
secretary
yes
he
replied
i
have
just
finished
did
you
happen
to
come
across
a
letter
bearing
on
that
is
was
there
a
letter
or
has
there
been
a
letter
of
instructions
as
to
a
single
large
diamond
which
was
to
come
or
had
come
by
mail
no
nothing
replied
flitcroft
promptly
the
only
letter
received
which
referred
to
diamonds
was
a
notification
of
a
shipment
from
south
africa
latham
thoughtfully
drummed
on
his
desk
well
i
expecting
some
such
letter
he
explained
when
it
comes
please
call
it
to
my
attention
send
my
stenographer
in
flitcroft
nodded
and
withdrew
and
for
an
hour
or
more
latham
was
engrossed
in
the
routine
of
correspondence
there
was
only
an
occasional
glance
at
the
box
in
the
pigeonhole
and
momentary
fits
of
abstraction
to
indicate
an
unabated
interest
and
growing
curiosity
in
the
diamond
the
last
letter
was
finished
and
the
stenographer
arose
to
leave
please
ask
czenki
to
come
here
latham
directed
and
after
a
while
czenki
appeared
he
was
a
spare
little
man
with
beady
black
eyes
bushy
brows
and
a
sinister
scar
extending
from
the
point
of
his
chin
across
the
right
jaw
czenki
drew
a
salary
of
thousand
dollars
a
year
from
the
latham
company
and
was
worth
twice
that
much
he
was
the
diamond
expert
of
the
firm
and
for
five
or
six
years
his
had
been
the
final
word
as
to
quality
and
value
he
had
been
a
laborer
in
the
south
african
diamond
fields
the
scar
was
an
assegai
thrust
about
the
time
cecil
rhodes
grip
was
first
felt
there
later
he
was
employed
as
an
expert
by
barney
barnato
at
kimberly
and
finally
he
went
to
london
with
adolph
zeidt
latham
nodded
as
he
entered
and
took
the
box
from
the
pigeonhole
here
something
i
like
you
to
look
at
he
remarked
czenki
removed
the
cover
and
turned
the
glittering
stone
out
into
his
hand
for
a
minute
or
more
he
stood
still
examining
it
as
he
turned
and
twisted
it
in
his
fingers
then
walked
over
to
a
window
adjusted
a
magnifying
glass
in
his
left
eye
and
continued
the
scrutiny
latham
swung
around
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
him
intently
it
the
most
perfect
i
ever
seen
the
expert
announced
at
last
i
dare
say
it
the
most
perfect
in
the
world
latham
arose
suddenly
and
strode
over
to
czenki
who
was
twisting
the
jewel
in
his
fingers
singling
out
dissecting
studying
the
colorful
flashes
measuring
the
facets
with
practised
eyes
weighing
it
on
his
seeking
a
possible
flaw
the
cutting
is
very
fine
the
expert
went
on
of
course
i
would
have
to
use
instruments
to
tell
me
if
it
is
mathematically
correct
and
the
weight
i
imagine
is
is
about
six
carats
perhaps
a
fraction
more
what
it
worth
asked
latham
approximately
i
mean
we
know
the
color
is
perfect
explained
czenki
precisely
if
in
addition
the
cutting
is
perfect
and
the
depth
is
right
and
the
weight
is
six
carats
or
a
fraction
more
it
worth
in
other
words
if
that
is
the
most
perfect
specimen
in
existence
as
it
seems
to
be
it
worth
whatever
you
might
choose
to
demand
for
it
twenty
thirty
thousand
dollars
with
this
color
and
assuming
it
to
be
six
carats
even
if
cut
it
would
be
worth
ten
or
twelve
thousand
latham
mopped
his
brow
and
this
had
come
by
mail
unregistered
it
would
not
be
possible
to
say
where
where
such
a
stone
came
from
what
country
latham
inquired
curiously
what
your
opinion
the
expert
shook
his
head
if
i
had
to
guess
i
should
say
brazil
of
course
he
replied
but
that
would
be
merely
because
the
most
perfect
diamonds
come
from
brazil
they
are
found
all
over
the
world
in
africa
russia
india
china
even
in
the
united
states
the
simple
fact
that
this
color
is
perfect
makes
conjecture
useless
latham
lapsed
into
silence
and
for
a
time
paced
back
and
forth
across
his
office
czenki
stood
waiting
please
get
the
exact
weight
latham
requested
abruptly
also
test
the
cutting
it
came
into
my
possession
in
rather
an
an
unusual
manner
and
i
curious
the
expert
went
out
an
hour
later
he
returned
and
placed
the
white
glazed
box
on
the
desk
before
latham
the
weight
is
six
and
carats
he
stated
the
depth
is
absolutely
perfect
according
to
the
diameter
of
the
girdle
the
facets
are
mathematically
correct
to
the
minutest
fraction
including
the
table
the
facets
on
the
side
are
equally
exact
including
the
or
facets
in
all
as
i
said
the
color
is
flawless
in
other
words
he
continued
without
hesitation
i
should
say
speaking
as
an
expert
that
it
is
the
most
perfect
diamond
existing
in
the
world
latham
had
been
staring
at
him
mutely
and
he
still
sat
silent
for
an
instant
after
czenki
had
finished
and
its
value
he
asked
at
last
its
value
czenki
repeated
musingly
you
know
latham
he
went
on
suddenly
there
are
a
hundred
experts
commissioned
by
royalty
scouring
the
diamond
markets
of
the
world
for
such
stones
as
this
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sale
and
a
price
by
all
means
offer
it
abroad
first
he
lifted
the
sparkling
iridescent
jewel
from
the
box
again
and
gazed
at
it
reflectively
there
is
not
one
stone
belonging
to
the
british
crown
for
instance
which
would
in
any
way
compare
with
this
not
even
the
latham
demanded
surprised
czenki
shook
his
head
not
even
the
it
is
larger
that
all
a
fraction
more
than
one
hundred
and
six
carats
but
it
has
neither
the
coloring
nor
the
cutting
of
this
there
was
a
pause
would
it
be
impertinent
if
i
ask
who
owns
this
i
do
know
replied
latham
slowly
i
do
know
but
it
is
ours
perhaps
later
i
be
able
to
i
beg
your
pardon
the
expert
interrupted
courteously
and
there
was
a
slight
expression
of
surprise
on
his
thin
scarred
face
is
that
all
latham
nodded
absently
and
czenki
left
the
room
chapter
ii
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
a
little
while
later
when
latham
started
out
to
luncheon
he
thrust
the
white
glazed
box
into
an
inside
pocket
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
schultze
gustave
schultze
the
greatest
importer
of
precious
stones
in
america
was
usually
at
the
club
where
he
had
luncheon
and
he
found
schultze
a
huge
blond
german
sitting
at
a
table
in
an
alcove
alone
gazing
out
upon
fifth
avenue
in
deep
abstraction
with
perplexed
wrinkles
about
his
blue
eyes
the
german
glanced
around
at
latham
quickly
as
he
proceeded
to
draw
out
a
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
sid
down
laadham
sid
down
he
invited
explosively
i

der

to
der
delephone
to
ask
there
was
a
restrained
note
of
excitement
in
the
german
voice
but
at
the
moment
it
was
utterly
lost
upon
latham
schultze
you
probably
imported
more
diamonds
in
the
last
ten
years
than
any
other
men
in
the
united
states
he
interrupted
i
have
something
here
i
want
you
to
see
perhaps
at
some
time
it
may
have
passed
through
your
hands
he
placed
the
glazed
box
on
the
table
for
an
instant
the
german
stared
at
it
with
amazed
eyes
then
one
fat
hand
darted
toward
it
and
he
spilled
the
diamond
out
on
the
napkin
in
his
plate
then
he
sat
gazing
as
if
fascinated
by
the
lambent
darting
flashes
deep
from
the
heart
laadham
he
exclaimed
and
with
fingers
which
shook
a
little
he
lifted
the
stone
and
squinted
through
it
toward
the
light
with
critical
eyes
latham
was
leaning
forward
on
the
table
waiting
watching
listening
well
he
queried
impatiently
at
last
laadham

explained
solemnly
with
his
characteristic
whimsical
philosophy
i

here
from
an
inner
pocket
he
produced
a
glazed
white
box
identical
with
that
which
latham
had
just
set
down
then
carefully
laid
the
cover
aside

latham
looked
and
gasped
here
was
the
counterpart
of

fought

an
absurd
nervous
thrill
in
his
voice
there
is
that
much
schultze
their
weight
is
exactly
the
same
for
a
long
time
the
two
men
sat
staring
at
each
other
unseeingly
finally
the
german
with
a
prodigious
teutonic
sigh
replaced
the
diamond
from
latham
right
hand
in
one
of
the
glazed
boxes
and
carefully
stowed
it
away
in
a
cavernous
pocket
latham
mechanically
disposed
of
the
other
in
the
same
manner
whose
are
they
he
demanded
at
length
why
are
they
sent
to
us
like
this
with
no
name
no
letter
of
explanation
until
i
saw
the
stone
you
have
i
believed
this
other
had
been
sent
to
me
by
some
careless
fool
for
setting
perhaps
and
that
a
letter
would
follow
it
i
merely
brought
it
here
on
the
chance
that
it
was
one
of
your
importations
and
that
you
could
identify
it
but
since
you
have
received
one
under
circumstances
which
seem
to
be
identical
now
he
paused
helplessly
what
does
it
mean
schultze
shrugged
his
huge
shoulders
and
thoughtfully
flicked
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
into
the
consomme
you

he
said
slowly

the
two
men
completed
a
scant
luncheon
in
silence
obviously
remarked
latham
as
he
laid
his
napkin
aside
the
diamonds
were
sent
to
us
by
the
same
person
obviously
they
were
sent
to
us
with
a
purpose
obviously
we
will
in
time
hear
from
the
person
who
sent
them
obviously
they
were
intended
to
be
perfectly
matched
so
let
see
if
they
are
come
to
my
office
and
let
czenki
examine
the
one
you
have
he
hesitated
an
instant
suppose
you
let
me
take
it
we
try
a
little
experiment
he
carefully
placed
the
jewel
which
the
german
handed
to
him
in
an
outside
pocket
and
together
they
went
to
his
office
czenki
appeared
in
answer
to
a
summons
and
latham
gave
him
the
german
box
that
the
diamond
you
examined
for
me
this
morning
is
it
he

czenki
turned
it
out
into
his
hand
and
scrutinized
it
perfunctorily
yes
he
replied
after
a
moment
are
you
quite
certain
latham
insisted
something
in
the
tone
caused
czenki
to
raise
his
beady
black
eyes
questioningly
for
an
instant
after
which
he
walked
over
to
a
window
and
adjusted
his
magnifying
glass
again
for
a
moment
or
more
he
stood
there
then
it

announced
positively

glanced
from
one
to
the
other
with
quick
inquisitive
glance
then
without
a
word
latham
produced
the
second
box
and
opened
it
the
expert
stared
incredulously
at
the
two
perfect
stones
and
finally
placing
them
side
by
side
on
a
sheet
of
paper
returned
to
the
window
and
sat
down
latham
and
schultze
stood
beside
him
looking
on
curiously
as
he
turned
and
twisted
the
jewels
under
his
powerful
glass
as
a
matter
of
fact
asked
latham
pointedly
at
last
you
would
not
venture
to
say
which
of
those
stones
it
was
you
examined
this
morning
would
you
no
replied
czenki
curtly
not
without
weighing
them
and
if
the
weight
is
identical
no
said
czenki
again
if
the
weight
is
the
same
there
is
not
the
minutest
fraction
of
a
difference
between
them

ran
through

with
feverish

and

found

around

on

and
for
a
minute
or
more
the
five
men
stood
still
and
gazed
first
at
the
diamonds
then
at
one

and
then
again
at
the

the

these
all
came
yesterday
morning
by

one
to
each
of
us
just
as
the
one
came
to
you
he
informed
latham
harris
here
of
harris
and
blacklock
learned
that
i
had
received
such
a
stone
and
brought
the
one
he
had
received
for
comparison
we
made
some
inquiries
together
and
found
that
a
duplicate
had
been
received
by
stoddard
of
the
three
of
us
came
here
to
see
if
schultze
could
give
us
any
information
and
he
telephoned
for

listened
blankly
it
positively
beyond

he
burst
out

what
does
it

philosophically

more

a
bucketful
the
truth
of
the
observation
came
to
the
four
others
simultaneously
hitherto
there
had
been
only
the
sense
of
wonder
and
admiration
now
came
the
definite
knowledge
that
diamonds
even
of
such
great
size
and
beauty
as
these
would
grow
cheap
if
they
were
to
be
picked
out
of
the
void
and
realization
of
this
astonishing
possibility
brought
five
shrewd
business
brains
to
a
unit
of
investigation
first
it
was
necessary
to
find
how
many
other
jewelers
had
received
duplicates
then
it
was
necessary
to
find
whence
they
came
a
plan
was
adopted
and
an
investigation
ordered
to
begin
at

send

during
the
next
six
days
half
a
score
of
private
detectives
were
at
work
on
the
mystery
with
the
slender
clews
at
hand
they
scanned
hotel
registers
quizzed
manufacturers
pestered
stamp
clerks
bedeviled
postal
officials
and
the
sum
total
of
their
knowledge
was
negative
save
in
the
fact
that
they
established
beyond
question
that
only
these
five
men
had
received
the
diamonds
and
meanwhile
the
heads
of
the
five
greatest
jewel
houses
in
new
york
were
assiduous
in
their
search
for
that
copperplate
superscription
in
their
daily
mail
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
it
came
latham
was
nervously
shuffling
his
unopened
personal
correspondence
when
he
came
upon
it
a
formal
white
square
envelope
directed
by
that
same
copperplate
hand
which
had
directed
the
boxes
he
dropped
into
his
chair
and
opened
the
envelope
with
eager
fingers
inside
was
this
letter
my
dear
sir
one
week
ago
i
took
the
liberty
of
sending
to
you
and
to
each
of
four
other
leading
jewelers
of
this
city
whose
names
you
know
a
single
large
diamond
of
rare
cutting
and
color
please
accept
this
as
a
gift
from
me
and
be
good
enough
to
convey
my
compliments
to
the
other
four
gentlemen
and
assure
them
that
theirs
too
were
gifts
believe
me
i
had
no
intention
of
making
a
mystery
of
this
it
was
necessary
definitely
to
attract
your
attention
and
i
could
conceive
of
no
more
certain
way
than
in
this
manner
in
return
for
the
value
of
the
jewels
i
shall
ask
that
you
and
the
four
others
concerned
give
me
an
audience
in
your
office
on
thursday
afternoon
next
at
three
that
you
make
known
this
request
to
the
others
and
that
three
experts
whose
judgment
you
will
all
accept
shall
meet
with
us
i
believe
you
will
appreciate
the
necessity
of
secrecy
in
this
matter
for
the
present
at
least
respectfully

they
were
on

promptly
all
of

latham

solomon

and

the
experts
agreed
upon
were
the
unemotional
czenki
cawthorne
an
englishman
in
the
employ
of
solomon
berger
and
company
and
schultze
who
gravely
admitted
that
he
was
the
first
expert
in
the
land
after
czenki
and
whose
opinion
of
himself
was
unanimously
accepted
by
the
others
the
meeting
place
was
the
directors
room
of
the
latham
company
at
one
minute
of
three
a
clerk
entered
with
a
card
and
handed
it
to
latham
van
cortlandt
wynne
latham
read
aloud
and
every
man
in
the

the
clerk
went
out
and
a
moment
later
wynne
appeared
he
was
tall
and
rather
slender
alert
of
eyes
graceful
of
person
perfectly
and
sure
of
himself
yet
without
one
trace
of
egotism
in
manner
or
appearance
a
fair
type
of
the
brisk
courteous
young
business
man
of
new
york
he
wore
a
tweed
suit
and
in
his
left
hand
carried
a
small
grip
for
an
instant
he
stood
framed
by
the
doorway
meeting
the
sharp
scrutiny
of
the
assembled
jewelers
with
a
frank
smile
for
a
little
time
no
one
spoke
merely
gazed
and
finally
mr
latham
queried
wynne
looking
from
one
to
the
other
latham
came
to
his
feet
with
a
sudden
realization
of
his
responsibilities
as
a
temporary
host
and
introductions
followed
wynne
passed
along
on
one
side
of
the
table
shaking
hands
with
each
man
in
turn
until
he
came
to
czenki
latham
introduced
them
czenki
repeated
wynne
and
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
rest
frankly
upon
the
expert
for
a
moment
your
name
has
been
repeated
to
me
so
often
that
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
knew
you
czenki
bowed
without
speaking
i
am
assuming
that
this
is
the
czenki
who
was
associated
with
barnato
and
mr
zeidt
the
young
man
went
on
that
is
correct
yes
replied
the
expert
and
i
believe
too
that
you
once
did
some
special
work
for
professor
henri
moissan
in
paris
czenki
black
eyes
seemed
to
be
searching
the
other
face
for
an
instant
and
then
he
nodded
affirmatively
i
made
some
tests
for
him
yes
he
volunteered
wynne
passed
on
along
the
other
side
of
the
long
table
and
stopped
at
the
end
latham
was
at
his
right
schultze
at
his
left
and
czenki
sat
at
the
far
end
facing
him
the
small
grip
was
on
the
floor
at
wynne
feet
for
a
moment
he
permitted
himself
to
enjoy
the
varying
expressions
of
interest
on
the
faces
around
the
table
gentlemen
he
began
then
you
all
probably
have
seen
my
letter
to
latham
or
at
least
you
are
aware
of
its
contents
so
you
understand
that
the
diamonds
which
were
mailed
to
you
are
your
property
i
am
not
a
eleemosynary
institution
for
the
relief
of
diamond
merchants
and
he
smiled
a
little
for
the
gifts
are
preliminary
to
a
plain
business
proposition
a
method
of
concentrating
your
attention
and
in
themselves
part
payment
if
i
may
say
it
for
any
worry
or
inconvenience
which
followed
upon
their
appearance
there
are
only
five
of
them
in
the
world
they
are
precisely
alike
and
they
are
yours
i
beg
of
you
to
accept
them
with
my
compliments
schultze
tilted
his
chair
back
a
little
the
better
to
study
the
young
man
countenance
i
am
going
to
make
some
remarkable
statements
the
young
man
continued
but
each
of
those
statements
is
capable
of
demonstration
here
and
now
do
hesitate
to
interrupt
if
there
is
a
question
in
your
mind
because
everything
i
shall
say
is
vital
to
each
of
you
as
bearing
on
the
utter
destruction
of
the
world
traffic
in
diamonds
it
is
coming
gentlemen
it
is
coming
just
as
inevitably
as
that
night
follows
day
unless
you
stop
it
you
stop
it
by
concerted
action
in
a
manner
which
i
shall
explain
later
he
paused
and
glanced
along
the
table
only
the
face
of
czenki
was
impassive
since
the
opening
of
the
fields
in
south
africa
wynne
resumed
quietly
something
like
five
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
have
been
found
there
and
we
say
arbitrarily
that
all
the
other
diamond
fields
of
the
world
including
brazil
and
australia
have
produced
another
five
hundred
million
dollars
worth
in
other
words
since
about
a
billion
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
has
been
placed
upon
the
market
gentlemen
that
represents
millions
and
millions
of
carats
forty
fifty
sixty
million
carats
in
the
rough
say
please
bear
those
figures
in
mind
a
moment
now
suddenly
and
as
yet
secretly
the
diamond
output
of
the
world
has
been
increased
fiftyfold
that
is
gentlemen
within
the
year
i
can
place
billion
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
at
the
prices
that
hold
now
in
the
open
market
and
within
still
another
year
i
can
place
still
another
billion
in
the
market
and
on
and
on
indefinitely
to
put
it
differently
i
have
found
the
unlimited
supply
vere
id
demanded
the
german
breathlessly
heedless
of
the
question
wynne
leaned
forward
on
the
table
and
gazed
with
eyes
into
the
faces
before
him
incredulity
was
the
predominant
expression
and
coupled
with
that
was
amazement
harris
with
quite
another
emotion
displaying
itself
on
his
face
pushed
back
his
chair
as
if
to
rise
a
slight
wrinkle
in
his
brow
was
all
the
evidence
of
interest
displayed
by
czenki
i
am
not
crazy
gentlemen
wynne
went
on
after
a
moment
and
the
perfectly
normal
voice
seemed
to
reassure
harris
for
he
sat
still
the
diamonds
are
now
in
existence
untold
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
them
but
there
is
the
tedious
work
of
cutting
they
in
existence
packed
away
as
you
pack
potatoes
i
thrust
my
two
hands
into
a
bag
and
bring
them
out
full
of
stones
as
perfect
as
the
ones
i
sent
you
he
straightened
up
again
and
the
deep
earnestness
of
his
face
relaxed
a
little
i
believe
you
said
wynne
that
you
could
prove
any
assertion
you
might
make
here
and
now
suggested
latham
coldly
it
occurs
to
me
that
such
extraordinary
statements
as
these
demand
immediate
proof
wynne
turned
and
smiled
at
him
you
are
quite
right
he
agreed
and
then
to
all
of
them
hardly
necessary
to
dwell
upon
the
value
of
colored
diamonds
the
rarest
and
most
precious
of
all
the
perfect
the
perfect
blue
and
the
perfect
green
he
drew
a
small
glazed
white
box
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
please
be
good
enough
to
look
at
this
mr
czenki
he
spun
a
rosily
glittering
object
some
of
an
inch
in
diameter
along
the
table
toward
czenki
it
flamed
and
flashed
as
it
rolled
with
that
deep
iridescent
blaze
which
left
no
doubt
of
what
it
was
every
man
at
the
table
arose
and
crowded
about
czenki
who
held
a
flamelike
sphere
in
his
outstretched
palm
for
their
inspection
there
was
a
tense
breathless
instant
it
a
diamond
remarked
czenki
as
if
he
himself
had
doubted
it
a
deep
cut
as
a
perfect
sphere
it
worth
half
a
million
dollars
if
it
worth
a
cent
exclaimed
solomon
almost
fiercely
and
this
please
wynne
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
spun
another
glittering
sphere
toward
them
this
as
brilliantly
softly
green
as
the
verdure
of
early
spring
prismatic
gleaming
radiant
czenki
beady
eyes
snapped
as
he
caught
it
and
held
it
out
for
the
others
to
see
and
some
strange
emotion
within
caused
him
to
close
his
teeth
savagely
and
this
said
wynne
again
and
a
third
sphere
rolled
along
the
table
this
was
blue
elusively
blue
as
a
moonlit
sky
its
rounded
sides
caught
the
light
from
the
windows
and
sparkled
it
back
and
now
the
three
jewels
lay
side
by
side
in
czenki
open
hand
the
while
the
five
greatest
diamond
merchants
of
the
united
states
glutted
their
eyes
upon
them
latham
face
went
deathly
white
from
sheer
excitement
the
german
violently
red
from
the
same
emotion
and
the
others
there
was
amazement
admiration
awe
in
them
czenki
countenance
was
again
impassive
chapter
iv
the
unlimited
supply
if
you
will
all
be
seated
again
please
requested
wynne
who
still
stood
cool
and
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
sound
of
his
voice
brought
a
returning
calm
to
the
others
and
they
resumed
their
seats
all
save
cawthorne
who
walked
over
to
a
window
with
the
three
spheres
in
his
hand
and
stood
there
examining
them
under
his
glass
you
gentlemen
know
of
course
the
natural
shape
of
the
diamond
in
the
rough
wynne
resumed
questioningly
here
are
a
dozen
specimens
which
may
interest
you
the
octahedron
the
rhombic
dodecahedron
the
triakisoctahedron
and
the
hexakisoctahedron
he
spread
them
along
the
table
with
a
sweeping
gesture
of
his
hand
colorless
inert
pebbles
ranging
in
size
from
a
pea
to
a
peanut
and
now
you
ask
where
do
they
come
from
the
others
nodded
unanimously
i
have
to
state
a
fact
that
you
all
know
as
part
answer
to
that
question
replied
wynne
a
perfect
diamond
is
a
perfect
diamond
no
matter
where
it
comes
from
africa
brazil
india
or
new
jersey
there
is
not
the
slightest
variation
in
value
if
the
stone
is
perfect
that
being
true
it
is
a
matter
of
no
concern
to
you
as
dealers
where
these
come
from
sufficient
it
is
that
they
are
here
and
being
here
they
bring
home
to
you
the
necessity
of
concerted
action
to
uphold
the
diamond
as
a
thing
of
value
you
said

the
young
man
smiled
slightly
and
drew
a
leather
packet
from
an
inner
pocket
he
stripped
it
of
several
rubber
bands
and
then
turned
to
czenki
again
czenki
i
have
been
told
that
a
few
years
ago
you
had
an
opportunity
of
examining
the

i

was

from

and
that
you
were
one
of

experts
to
whom
was
intrusted
the
task
of
selecting
four
stones
of
the
identical
coloring
to
be
set
alongside
it
that
is
correct
czenki
agreed
you
held
the
in
your
hand
and
you
would
be
able
to
identify
it
would
be
able
to
identify
it
said
cawthorne
positively
he
had
turned
at
the
window
quickly
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
wynne
walked
around
the
table
to
czenki
and
cawthorne
approached
them
suppose
then
you
gentlemen
examine
this
together
suggested
wynne
he
lifted
a
great
glittering
jewel
from
the
leather
packet
and
held
it
aloft
that
all
might
see
then
he
carefully
placed
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
experts
the
others
came
to
their
feet
and
stood
gazing
as
if
fascinated
by
jove
exclaimed
cawthorne
for
a
minute
or
more
the
two
experts
studied
the
huge
diamond
one
hundred
and
six
carats
and
a
fraction
beneath
their
glasses
and
finally
cawthorne
picked
it
up
and
led
the
way
toward
the
window
czenki
and
the
german
followed
him
gentlemen
and
cawthorne
now
turned
sharply
to
face
the
others
this
the
czenki
did
mention
it
but
i
was
one
of
the
three
experts
who
had
opportunity
to
examine
the
this
the
startled
questioning
eyes
were
turned
upon
wynne
he
was
smiling
there
was
a
question
in
his
face
as
he
regarded
czenki
it
is
either
the
or
an
exact
duplicate
said
czenki
it
the
repeated
cawthorne
doggedly
id
seems
to
me
interposed
schultze
dat
if
der
vas
missing
somebody
would
haf
heard
ain
id
i
haf
nod
heard
czenki
made
a
misdake
der
oder
day
maybe
you
make
id
you
made
a
mistake
i
assure
you
cawthorne
remarked
wynne
quietly
you
identify
that
as
the
of
course
by
a
slight
inaccuracy
in
one
of
the
facets
adjoining
the
that
inaccuracy
is
known
to
every
diamond
expert
the
mistake
you
make
is
a
compliment
to
that
as
a
replica
he
resumed
his
position
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
schultze
sat
beside
him
amazement
was
a
thing
of
the
past
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
czenki
dropped
into
his
chair
again
and
now
czenki
speaking
as
an
expert
what
would
you
say
was
the
most
perfect
diamond
the
world
asked
wynne
the
five
stones
you
mailed
to
these
gentlemen
replied
the
expert
without
hesitation
perhaps
i
should
have
specified
the
most
perfect
diamond
known
to
the
world
at
large
wynne
added
smilingly
the
regent
again
cawthorne
looked
around
with
bewilderment
in
his
eyes
the
others
nodded
their
approval
of
czenki
opinion
the
regent
yes
wynne
agreed
one
hundred
and
and
carats
cut
as
a
brilliant
worn
by
napoleon
in
his
now
in
the
louvre
at
paris
the
property
of
the
french
government
valued
at
two
and
a
half
million
dollars
his
hand
disappeared
into
the
leather
packet
again
poised
on
his
when
he
withdrew
them
was
another
huge
jewel
he
dropped
it
into
schultze
hand
there
is
further
proof
that
the
diamond
output
has
increased
fiftyfold
schultze
seemed
dazed
as
he
turned
and
twisted
the
diamond
in
his
hand
after
a
moment
he
passed
it
on
down
the
table
without
a
word
a
duplicate
also
and
wynne
glanced
at
cawthorne
it
is
reasonably
certain
that
you
would
have
heard
of
that
if
it
had
disappeared
from
the
louvre
he
turned
to
schultze
again
i
may
add
that
this
fiftyfold
increase
in
output
is
not
confined
to
small
stones
he
went
on
tauntingly
they
are
of
all
sizes
and
values
for
instance
he
lifted
still
another
jewel
from
the
packet
and
held
it
aloft
for
an
instant
the
orloff
gasped
solomon
no
the
young
man
corrected
this
too
is
a
duplicate
the
original
is
in
the
russian
sceptre
this
is
a
replica
color
weight
and
cutting
being
identical
one
hundred
and
carats
nearly
as
large
as
a
pigeon
egg
again
wynne
glanced
along
the
table
suddenly
the
frank
amazement
had
vanished
from
the
faces
of
these
men
and
he
found
only
the
tense
interest
of
an
audience
watching
a
clever
juggler
for
a
time
schultze
studied
the
orloff
duplicate
then
passed
it
along
to
the
experts
der
grand
cullinan
diamond
weighs
only
two
or
pounds
he
questioned
in
a
tone
of
deep
resignation
maybe
you
haf
in
der
backage
alretty
not
yet
replied
wynne
but
i
may
possibly
get
that
on
my
next
trip
out
who
knows
there
was
a
long
tense
silence
mechanically
czenki
placed
the
three
spheres
and
the
replicas
in
an
orderly
little
row
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
the
uncut
stones
beside
them
six
seven
eight
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
gentlemen
are
you
convinced
demanded
wynne
suddenly
is
there
one
lingering
doubt
in
any
mind
here
as
to
the
tremendous
find
which
makes
the
production
of
all
those
possible
id
iss
der
miracle
vynne
admitted
the
german
gravely
after
a
little
pause
dere
iss
someding
before
us
as
nefer
vas
in
der
vorld
i
am
gonvinced
up
to
this
moment
gentlemen
the
de
beers
syndicate
has
controlled
the
diamond
market
wynne
announced
but
now
from
this
moment
i
control
it
i
hold
it
there
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
with
the
unlimited
supply
back
of
me
i
am
offering
you
an
opportunity
to
prevent
the
annihilation
of
the
market
it
rests
with
you
if
i
turn
loose
a
billion
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
within
the
year
you
are
ruined
all
of
you
you
that
it
hardly
necessary
to
tell
you
and
gentlemen
i
do
care
to
do
it
what
is
your
proposition
queried
latham
quietly
his
face
was
ghastly
white
haggard
lines
limned
by
amazement
and
realization
were
marked
clearly
on
it
what
is
your
proposition
he
repeated
wait
a
minute
interposed
solomon
protestingly
and
he
turned
to
the
young
man
the
syndicate
controls
the
market
by
force
of
a
reserve
stock
of
ten
or
fifteen
million
dollars
do
we
understand
that
you
have
more
than
these
ready
for
market
now
wynne
stooped
and
lifted
the
small
grip
which
had
been
unheeded
on
the
floor
he
unfastened
the
catch
and
turned
the
bag
upside
down
upon
the
table
when
he
raised
it
again
the
assembled
jewelers
gazed
upon
a
spectacle
unknown
and
undreamed
of
in
the
history
of
the
world
a
great
glittering
heap
of
diamonds
flashing
colorful
prismatic
radiant
bedazzling
they
rattled
like
pebbles
upon
the
mahogany
table
as
they
slipped
and
slid
one
against
another
and
then
at
rest
resolved
themselves
into
a
steady
blaze
which
was
almost
blinding
now
gentlemen
on
the
table
before
you
there
are
about
thirty
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
wynne
announced
calmly
they
are
all
perfect
every
one
of
them
and
they
mine
i
know
where
they
come
from
you
ca
find
out
it
none
of
your
business
are
you
satisfied
latham
looked
looked
until
his
eyes
seemed
bursting
from
his
head
and
then
with
an
inarticulate
little
cry
fell
forward
on
the
table
with
his
face
on
his
arms
the
german
importer
came
to
his
feet
with
one
vast
teutonic
oath
then
sat
down
again
solomon
plunged
his
hand
into
the
blazing
heap
and
laughed
senselessly
the
others
were
silent
stunned
overcome
wynne
walked
around
the
table
and
replaced
the
spheres
and
replicas
in
his
pocket
after
which
he
resumed
his
former
position
i
have
stated
my
case
gentlemen
he
continued
quietly
very
quietly
now
for
my
proposition
briefly
it
is
this
for
a
consideration
i
will
destroy
the
unlimited
supply
i
will
bind
myself
to
secrecy
as
you
must
i
will
guarantee
that
no
stone
from
the
same
source
is
ever
offered
in
the
market
or
privately
while
you
gentlemen
and
his
manner
was
emphatically
deliberate
purchase
from
me
at
the
carat
price
you
now
pay
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
he
paused
there
was
not
a
sound
no
one
moved
you
may
put
them
on
the
market
as
you
may
agree
slowly
thus
preventing
any
material
fluctuation
in
value
he
went
on
how
to
hold
this
tremendous
reserve
secretly
and
still
permit
the
operation
of
the
other
diamond
mines
of
the
world
is
the
great
problem
you
will
have
to
face
he
leaned
over
picked
up
a
handful
from
the
heap
and
replaced
them
in
the
leather
bag
the
others
he
swept
off
into
it
then
snapped
the
lock
i
will
give
you
one
week
to
decide
what
you
will
do
he
said
in
conclusion
if
you
accept
the
proposition
then
six
weeks
from
next
thursday
at
three
i
shall
expect
a
cash
payment
of
ten
million
dollars
for
a
portion
of
the
stones
now
cut
and
ready
within
a
year
all
the
diamonds
will
have
been
delivered
and
the
transaction
must
be
closed
he
hesitated
an
instant
i
sorry
gentlemen
if
the
terms
seem
hard
but
i
think
after
consideration
you
will
agree
that
i
have
done
you
a
favor
by
coming
to
you
instead
of
going
into
the
market
and
destroying
it
i
will
call
next
thursday
at
three
for
your
answer
that
is
all
good
day
the
door
opened
and
closed
behind
him
a
minute
two
minutes
three
minutes
passed
and
no
one
spoke
at
last
the
german
came
to
his
feet
slowly
with
a
sigh
anyhow
gendlemens
he
remarked
dat
young
man
has
a
hell
of
a
lod
of
diamonds
ain
id
chapter
v
the
astute
birnes
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
four
when
wynne
strode
through
the
immense
retail
sales
department
of
the
latham
company
and
a
uniformed
page
held
open
the
front
door
for
him
to
pass
out
once
on
the
sidewalk
the
diamond
master
of
the
world
paused
long
enough
to
pull
on
his
gloves
carelessly
chucking
the
small
grip
with
its
million
dollars
worth
of
precious
stones
under
one
arm
then
he
turned
up
fifth
avenue
toward
street
a
sneak
thief
brushed
past
him
appraised
him
with
one
furtive
glance
then
went
his
way
seeking
quarry
more
promising
simultaneously
with
wynne
appearance
three
men
whose
watchful
eyes
had
been
fastened
on
the
doorway
of
the
latham
company
for
something
more
than
an
hour
stirred
one
of
them
frank
claflin
was
directly
across
the
street
strolling
along
idly
the
most
purposeless
of
all
in
the
hurrying
throng
another
steve
birnes
chief
of
the
birnes
detective
agency
appeared
from
the
hallway
of
a
building
adjoining
the
latham
company
and
moved
along
behind
wynne
some
thirty
feet
in
the
rear
the
third
jerry
malone
was
half
a
block
away
up
fifth
avenue
coming
slowly
toward
them
birnes
adjusted
his
pace
to
that
of
wynne
step
for
step
and
then
seeming
assured
of
his
safety
from
any
chance
glance
ostentatiously
mopped
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
flirting
it
a
little
to
the
left
as
he
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
claflin
across
the
street
understood
from
that
that
he
was
to
go
on
up
fifth
avenue
to
street
the
next
intersection
and
turn
west
to
board
any
crosstown
car
which
wynne
might
possibly
take
and
a
cabby
who
had
been
sitting
motionless
on
his
box
down
the
street
understood
from
it
that
he
was
to
move
slowly
along
behind
birnes
and
be
prepared
for
an
emergency
between
and
streets
jerry
malone
approached
and
passed
wynne
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
him
and
went
on
toward
his
chief
drop
in
behind
here
birnes
remarked
crisply
to
malone
without
looking
around
i
walk
on
ahead
and
turn
east
in
street
to
nail
him
if
he
swings
a
car
claflin
got
him
going
west
wynne
was
perhaps
some
twenty
feet
from
the
corner
of
street
and
fifth
avenue
when
birnes
passed
him
his
glance
lingered
on
the
broad
back
of
the
chief
reflectively
as
he
swung
by
and
turned
into
the
cross
street
after
a
quick
glance
at
an
approaching
car
then
wynne
smiled
he
paused
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
long
enough
for
an
automobile
to
pass
then
went
on
across
street
to
the
uptown
side
and
turning
flatly
looked
birnes
over
pensively
after
which
he
leaned
up
against
an
pole
and
scribbled
something
on
an
envelope
a
closed
cab
came
wriggling
and
squirming
up
fifth
avenue
as
it
reached
the
middle
of
street
wynne
raised
his
hand
and
the
cab
drew
up
beside
him
he
said
something
to
the
driver
opened
the
door
and
stepped
in
birnes
smiled
confidently
so
that
was
it
eh
he
too
crossed
street
and
lifted
his
hand
the
cab
which
had
been
drifting
along
behind
him
immediately
came
up
now
jimmy
get
on
the
job
instructed
birnes
as
he
stepped
in
keep
that
chap
in
sight
and
when
he
stops
you
stop
wynne
cab
jogged
along
comfortably
up
the
avenue
twisting
and
winding
a
path
between
the
other
vehicles
the
while
birnes
regarded
it
with
thoughtful
gaze
its
number
dangled
on
a
white
board
in
the
rear
birnes
just
happened
to
note
it
grand
central
station
i
bet
a
hat
he
mused
but
the
closed
cab
did
turn
into
street
it
went
past
then
on
past
delmonico
past
the
cathedral
past
the
plaza
at
street
and
still
on
uptown
it
was
not
hurrying
it
merely
moved
steadily
but
once
free
of
the
snarl
which
culminates
at
the
street
entrance
to
central
park
its
speed
was
increased
a
little
past
street
and
at
it
slowed
up
and
halted
at
the
sidewalk
on
the
far
side
stop
in
front
of
a
door
jimmy
directed
the
detective
hastily
jimmy
obeyed
gracefully
and
birnes
stepped
out
hardly
half
a
block
behind
the
closed
cab
he
went
through
an
elaborate
pretense
of
paying
jimmy
the
while
he
regarded
wynne
who
had
also
alighted
and
was
paying
the
driver
the
small
grip
was
on
the
ground
between
his
feet
as
he
ransacked
his
pocketbook
a
settlement
was
reached
the
cabby
nodded
touched
his
horse
with
his
whip
and
continued
to
jog
on
up
fifth
avenue
now
he
did
order
that
chap
to
come
back
or
he
would
have
paid
him
the
detective
reasoned
therefore
he
close
to
where
he
is
going
but
wynne
seemed
in
no
hurry
instead
he
stood
still
for
a
minute
gazing
after
the
retreating
vehicle
which
fact
made
it
necessary
for
birnes
to
start
a
dispute
with
jimmy
as
to
just
how
much
the
fare
should
be
they
played
the
scene
admirably
had
wynne
been
listening
he
might
even
have
heard
part
of
the
vigorous
argument
whether
he
listened
or
not
he
turned
and
gazed
straight
at
birnes
until
finally
the
detective
recognized
the
necessity
of
getting
out
of
sight
with
a
final
explosion
he
handed
a
bill
to
jimmy
and
turned
to
go
up
the
steps
of
the
house
he
had
no
business
there
but
he
must
do
something
jimmy
turned
the
cab
short
and
went
rattling
away
down
fifth
avenue
to
await
orders
in
the
lee
of
a
corner
a
block
or
so
away
and
meanwhile
as
wynne
still
stood
on
the
corner
birnes
had
to
go
on
up
the
steps
but
as
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
third
step
he
knew
though
he
had
not
looked
apparently
yet
he
knew
that
wynne
had
raised
his
hand
and
that
in
that
hand
was
a
small
white
envelope
and
further
he
knew
that
wynne
was
gazing
directly
at
him
now
that
was
odd
slowly
it
began
to
dawn
upon
the
detective
that
wynne
was
trying
to
attract
his
attention
if
he
heeded
the
signal
evidently
it
was
intended
as
such
it
would
be
a
confession
that
he
was
following
wynne
and
realizing
this
he
took
two
more
steps
up
wynne
waved
the
envelope
again
after
which
he
folded
it
across
twice
and
thrust
it
into
a
crevice
of
a
beside
him
then
he
turned
east
along
street
and
disappeared
the
detective
had
seen
the
performance
all
of
it
and
he
was
perplexed
it
was
wholly
unprecedented
however
the
first
thing
to
do
now
was
to
keep
wynne
in
sight
so
he
came
down
the
steps
and
walked
rapidly
on
to
street
pausing
to
peer
around
the
corner
before
he
turned
wynne
was
idling
along
half
a
block
away
without
the
slightest
apparent
interest
in
what
was
happening
behind
inevitably
birnes
eyes
were
drawn
to
the
across
the
street
a
tag
end
of
white
paper
gleamed
tantalizingly
now
what
the
deuce
did
it
mean
being
only
human
birnes
went
across
the
street
and
got
the
paper
it
was
an
envelope
as
he
unfolded
it
and
gazed
at
the
address
written
in
pencil
his
mouth
opened
in
undignified
astonishment
it
was
addressed
to
him
steve
birnes
chief
of
the
birnes
detective
agency
wynne
had
still
not
looked
back
so
the
detective
trailed
along
behind
opening
the
envelope
as
he
walked
a
note
inside
ran
briefly
my
address
is
no
east
street
if
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
see
me
please
call
there
about
six
this
afternoon
van
cortlandt
wynne
now
here
was
perhaps
as
savory
a
kettle
of
fish
as
birnes
had
ever
stumbled
upon
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
embarrassing
situation
for
the
professional
sleuth
than
to
find
himself
suddenly
taken
into
the
confidence
of
the
person
he
is
shadowing
but
he
being
taken
into
wynne
confidence
ah
that
was
the
question
admitting
that
wynne
knew
who
he
was
and
admitting
that
he
knew
he
was
being
followed
was
not
this
apparent
frankness
an
attempt
to
throw
him
off
the
scent
he
would
see
would
birnes
he
quickened
his
pace
a
little
then
slowed
up
instantly
because
wynne
had
stopped
on
the
corner
of
madison
avenue
and
as
a
downtown
car
came
rushing
along
he
stepped
out
to
board
it
birnes
scuttled
across
the
street
and
by
a
dexterous
jump
swung
on
the
car
as
it
fled
past
wynne
had
gone
forward
and
was
taking
a
seat
birnes
remained
on
the
back
platform
sheltered
by
the
accommodating
bulk
of
a
fat
man
and
flattered
himself
that
wynne
had
not
seen
him
by
peering
over
a
huge
shoulder
the
detective
was
still
able
to
watch
wynne
he
saw
him
pay
his
fare
and
then
he
saw
him
place
the
small
grip
on
his
knees
and
unfasten
the
catch
not
knowing
what
was
in
that
grip
birnes
was
curious
to
see
what
came
out
of
it
nothing
came
out
of
it
it
was
empty
there
was
no
question
of
this
for
wynne
opened
it
wide
and
turned
it
upside
down
to
shake
it
out
it
did
mean
anything
in
particular
to
birnes
the
fact
that
the
grip
was
empty
so
he
did
get
excited
about
it
wynne
left
the
car
at
street
the
south
end
of
the
park
avenue
tunnel
by
the
front
door
and
the
detective
stepped
off
the
rear
end
wynne
brushed
past
him
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
and
as
he
did
so
he
smiled
a
little
a
very
little
he
walked
on
up
park
avenue
to
street
turned
in
there
and
entered
a
house
about
the
middle
of
the
block
with
a
the
detective
glanced
at
the
number
of
the
house
and
felt
aggrieved
it
was
the
number
that
was
written
in
the
note
and
wynne
had
entered
with
a
key
which
meant
in
all
probability
that
he
live
there
as
he
had
said
but
why
did
he
take
that
useless
cab
ride
up
fifth
avenue
if
he
had
no
objection
to
any
one
knowing
his
address
why
did
he
go
so
far
out
of
his
way
birnes
could
say
as
he
pondered
these
questions
he
saw
a
come
out
of
a
house
adjoining
that
which
wynne
had
entered
an
he
went
up
boldly
to
question
her
did
a
wynne
live
next
door
yes
how
long
had
he
lived
there
five
or
six
months
did
he
own
the
house
no
the
people
who
owned
the
house
had
gone
to
europe
for
a
year
and
had
rented
it
furnished
no
wynne
did
have
a
family
he
lived
there
alone
except
for
two
servants
a
cook
and
a
housemaid
she
had
never
noticed
anything
unusual
about
wynne
or
the
servants
or
the
house
yes
he
went
out
every
day
downtown
to
business
no
she
did
know
what
his
business
was
but
she
had
an
idea
that
he
was
a
broker
that
was
all
from
a
telephone
booth
the
detective
detailed
claflin
and
malone
who
had
returned
to
the
office
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
on
the
house
after
which
he
walked
on
to
fifth
avenue
and
down
fifth
avenue
to
the
establishment
of
the
latham
company
latham
would
see
him
yes
in
fact
latham
harried
by
the
events
of
the
past
two
hours
bewildered
by
a
diamond
deal
which
had
been
thrust
down
his
throat
gracefully
but
none
the
less
certainly
and
ridden
by
the
keenest
curiosity
was
delighted
to
see
birnes
i
got
his
house
address
all
right
birne
boasted
in
the
beginning
of
course
it
was
against
the
ethics
of
the
profession
to
tell
he
got
it
progress
already
commented
latham
with
keen
interest
good
then
the
detective
detailed
the
information
he
had
received
from
the
maid
adding
thereto
divers
and
sundry
conclusions
of
his
own
latham
marveled
exceedingly
he
tried
to
shake
us
all
right
when
he
went
out
birnes
went
on
to
explain
but
the
trap
was
set
and
there
was
no
escape
with
certain
minor
omissions
he
told
of
the
cab
ride
to
street
the
trip
across
to
a
downtown
car
and
as
a
matter
of
convincing
circumstantial
detail
added
the
incident
of
the
empty
gripsack
empty
repeated
latham
startled
empty
did
you
say
empty
as
a
bass
drum
the
detective
assured
him
complacently
he
turned
it
upside
down
and
shook
it
then
what
became
of
them
demanded
latham
became
of
what
the
diamonds
man
what
became
of
the
diamonds
you
did
mention
any
diamonds
to
me
except
those
five
the
other
day
the
detective
reminded
him
coldly
your
instructions
were
to
find
out
all
about
this
man
who
he
is
what
he
does
where
he
goes
and
the
rest
this
is
my
preliminary
report
you
did
mention
diamonds
i
did
know
he
would
have
them
latham
exploded
irascibly
that
empty
gripsack
man
when
he
left
here
he
carried
millions
i
mean
a
great
quantity
of
diamonds
in
it
a
great
quantity
of
the
detective
began
and
then
he
sat
up
straight
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
latham
in
bewilderment
if
the
gripsack
was
empty
when
he
was
on
the
car
latham
rushed
on
excitedly
then
do
you
see
that
he
got
rid
of
the
diamonds
somehow
from
the
time
he
left
here
until
you
saw
that
the
gripsack
empty
how
did
he
get
rid
of
them
where
does
he
keep
them
and
where
does
he
get
them
birnes
closed
his
teeth
grimly
and
his
eyes
snapped
he
knew
why
wynne
had
taken
that
useless
cab
ride
up
fifth
avenue
it
was
to
enable
him
to
get
rid
of
the
diamonds
there
was
an
accomplice
in
detective
parlance
the
second
person
is
always
an
accomplice
in
that
closed
cab
it
had
all
been
prearranged
wynne
had
deliberately
made
a
monkey
of
him
steven
birnes
reluctantly
the
detective
permitted
himself
to
remember
that
he
did
know
whether
there
was
anybody
in
that
cab
or
not
when
wynne
entered
it
and
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
did
know
one
thing
number
of
the
cab
he
arose
abruptly
with
the
light
of
a
great
determination
in
his
face
whose
diamonds
were
they
he
demanded
they
were
his
as
far
as
we
know
replied
latham
how
much
were
they
worth
latham
looked
him
over
thoughtfully
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
that
birnes
he
said
at
last
there
are
a
great
number
of
them
and
they
are
worth
they
are
worth
a
large
sum
of
money
and
they
are
all
unset
that
enough
for
you
to
know
i
think
it
seemed
to
be
quite
enough
for
birnes
to
know
it
may
be
that
i
will
have
something
further
to
report
this
evening
he
told
latham
if
not
i
see
you
here
he
went
out
ten
minutes
later
he
was
talking
to
a
friend
in
police
headquarters
over
the
telephone
the
records
there
showed
that
the
license
for
the
particular
cab
he
had
followed
had
been
issued
to
one
william
johns
he
was
usually
to
be
found
around
the
cabstand
in
madison
square
and
lived
in
charlton
street
chapter
vi
the
mysterious
woman
birnes
busy
heels
fairly
spurned
the
pavements
of
fifth
avenue
as
he
started
toward
madison
square
here
was
a
long
line
of
cabs
drawn
up
beside
the
curb
some
twenty
or
thirty
in
all
the
fifth
from
the
end
bore
the
number
he
sought
birnes
chuckled
and
there
alongside
it
stood
william
johns
swapping
billingsgate
with
the
driver
of
a
hansom
the
while
he
kept
one
eye
open
for
a
prospective
fare
it
was
too
easy
birnes
paused
long
enough
to
congratulate
himself
upon
his
marvelous
acumen
and
then
he
approached
the
driver
you
are
william
johns
he
accused
him
sharply
that
me
cap
the
cabby
answered
readily
a
few
minutes
past
four
this
afternoon
you
went
up
fifth
avenue
and
stopped
at
the
corner
of
street
to
pick
up
a
fare
a
young
man
yep
you
drove
him
to
the
corner
of
street
and
fifth
avenue
the
detective
went
on
just
to
forestall
possible
denials
he
got
out
there
paid
you
and
you
went
on
up
fifth
avenue
far
be
it
from
me
to
deceive
you
cap
responded
the
cabby
with
irritating
levity
i
done
that
same
who
was
that
man
demanded
birnes
coldly
search
me
i
never
seen
him
before
the
detective
regarded
the
cabby
with
accusing
eyes
then
quite
casually
he
flipped
open
his
coat
and
johns
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
silver
shield
it
might
only
have
been
accident
of
course
still
now
johns
who
was
the
man
in
the
cab
when
you
stopped
to
pick
up
the
second
man
at
street
wrong
cap
and
the
cabby
grinned
there
was
any
man
do
attempt
to
deny
no
man
cap
it
was
a
woman
a
woman
the
detective
repeated
a
woman
sure
thing
a
woman
a
regular
woman
and
cap
she
was
a
pippin
a
peachorino
a
beauty
bright
he
added
gratuitously
birnes
stared
thoughtfully
across
the
street
for
a
little
while
so
there
was
a
woman
in
it
wynne
had
transferred
the
contents
of
the
gripsack
to
her
in
a
cab
on
a
crowded
thoroughfare
right
under
his
nose
i
was
a
little
farther
down
the
line
there
johns
went
on
to
explain
about
a
quarter
of
four
i
guess
she
came
along
she
got
in
after
telling
me
to
drive
slowly
up
fifth
avenue
so
i
would
pass
street
five
minutes
or
so
after
four
if
a
young
man
with
a
gripsack
hailed
me
at
the
corner
i
was
to
stop
and
let
him
get
in
then
i
was
to
go
on
up
fifth
avenue
if
i
was
stopped
i
was
to
drive
on
to
street
cut
across
to
madison
avenue
down
to
street
then
back
to
fifth
avenue
and
past
street
again
going
uptown
the
guy
with
the
gripsack
caught
us
first
crack
out
of
the
box
and
then
demanded
the
detective
eagerly
i
went
on
up
fifth
avenue
according
to
sailing
orders
and
the
guy
inside
stopped
me
at
street
he
got
out
and
gim
me
a
telling
me
to
go
a
few
blocks
then
turn
and
bring
the
lady
back
to
the
sixth
avenue
at
street
i
done
it
that
all
she
went
up
the
steps
and
that
the
last
i
seen
of
her
did
she
carry
a
small
gripsack
yep
it
would
hold
about
as
much
as
a
high
hat
explicit
as
the
information
was
it
led
nowhere
apparently
birnes
readily
understood
this
much
yet
there
was
a
chance
a
bare
chance
that
he
might
trace
the
girl
on
the
in
which
case
anyway
it
was
worth
trying
what
did
she
look
like
how
was
she
dressed
he
asked
she
had
on
one
of
them
blue
things
with
a
lid
to
match
and
a
long
feather
in
it
the
cabby
answered
obligingly
she
was
pretty
as
a
as
a
she
was
a
beaut
cap
sort
of
skinny
and
had
all
sorts
of
hair
on
her
head
brownish
goldish
sort
of
hair
she
was
about
or
three
maybe
and
and
cap
she
was
the
goods
that
all
in
the
course
of
a
day
a
thousand
women
more
or
less
answering
that
description
in
a
general
sort
of
way
ride
back
and
forth
on
the
elevated
trains
birnes
sighed
as
he
remembered
this
still
it
might
produce
results
then
came
another
idea
did
you
happen
to
look
in
the
cab
after
the
young
woman
left
it
he
inquired
no
had
any
fares
since
no
birnes
opened
the
door
of
the
closed
cab
and
glanced
in
perhaps
there
might
be
a
stray
glove
a
handkerchief
some
more
definite
clew
than
this
vague
description
he
scrutinized
the
inside
of
the
vehicle
carefully
there
was
nothing
yes
by
jingo
here
something
a
white
streak
under
the
edge
of
the
cushion
on
the
seat
birnes
hopeful
fingers
fished
it
out
it
was
a
white
envelope
sealed
and
addressed
to
him
if
you
are
as
clever
as
i
imagine
you
are
you
will
find
this
my
address
is
no
east

i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
if
you
will
call

it
was
most
disconcerting
really

a

messenger
a
pigeon
dropped
down
out
of
an
azure
sky
and
settled
on
a
girder
of
the
great
singer
building
for
a
time
it
rested
there
with
folded
pinions
in
a
din
of
clanging
hammers
and
a
workman
far
out
on
a
delicately
balanced
beam
of
steel
paused
in
his
labors
to
regard
the
bird
with
friendly
eyes
the
pigeon
returned
his
gaze
unafraid
well

if
i
had
as
little
trouble
getting
up
here
and
down
again
as
you
do

job
the
workman
remarked
cheerfully
the
pigeon
cooed
an
answer
the
steel
worker
extended
a
caressing
hand
whereupon
the
bird
rose
swiftly
surely
with
white
wings
widely
stretched
circled
once
over
the
vast
steel
structure
then
darted
away
to
the
north
the
workman
watched
the
speck
until
it
was
lost
against

sitting
at

in

was
aroused
from

tinkle

bell
he
glanced
up

and

up

exclaimed
keenly
certainly
they
would
have

come
to
think
of
it
the

on

would
have
been

so
enormous

that
and
he
lost
the

tone
so
enormous
that
we

of
it

latham
sat
perfectly
still
gazing
into
the
other
eyes
first
he
was
startled
then
this
gave
way
to
incredulity
and
at
last
he
shook
his
head
no

said
flatly

an

for

who
a

appeared
with
an
inquiry
in

eyes
and
a
nod

asked
of

czenki
have
you
any
very
definite
idea
as
to
where
those

latham
no

the
unhesitating
response
is
it
possible
that
they
might

latham
went
on
certainly
they
might
have
been
found
anywhere
as
a
matter
of
fact
were
any
diamonds
found
in
the
united
states
yes
frequently
one
very
large
diamond
was
found
in
at
manchester
across
the
james
river
from
richmond
virginia
it
weighed
carats
when
cut
and
is
the
largest
i
believe
ever
found
in
this
country
latham
seemed
surprised
why
you
astonish
me
he
remarked
vait
a
minute

he
astonish
you

else
in
der
united
states
haf
diamonds
been
found
czenki
in
california
in
north
carolina
and
in
hall
county
georgia
replied
the
expert
readily
there
is
good
ground
for
the
belief
that
the
stone
found
at
richmond
had
been
washed
down
from
the
mountains
farther
in
the
interior
and
if
this
is
true
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
the
scientific
hypothesis
that
diamond
fields
lie
somewhere
in
the
appalachian
range
because
the
diamonds
found
in
both
north
carolina
and
georgia
were
adjacent
to
these
mountains
he
paused
a
moment
this
is
all
a
matter
of
record
his
employer
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
gripping
the
arms
fiercely
as
he
stared
at
him
do
you
believe
it
possible
czenki
he
asked
deliberately
that
wynne
has
found
these
diamond
fields
the
expert
shrugged
his
slender
shoulders
it
is
possible
of
course
he
replied
from
time
to
time
great
sums
of
money
have
been
spent
in
searching
for
them
so
he
waved
his
hand
and
was
silent
zo
you

ve
don

anyding

der

you
haf
lived
so
long
as
me
you
wo
know
any
more
as
i
do
there
was
silence
for
a
long
time
czenki
sat
with
impassive
face
and
his
hands
at
rest
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
at
last
he
spoke
if
you
pardon
me
latham
i
may
suggest
another
possibility
iss
demanded
schultze
quickly
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
french
scientist
charles
friedel
czenki
asked
addressing
latham
never
no
well
this
idea
has
occurred
to
me
some
years
ago
he
discovered
two
or
three
small
diamonds
in
a
meteor
we
may
safely
assume
from
the
fact
that
there
were
diamonds
in
one
meteor
that
there
may
be
diamonds
in
other
meteors
therefore
the
german
importer
anticipated
his
line
of
thought
and
arose
with
a
guttural
burst
of
teutonic
expletives
therefore
the
expert
went
on
steadily
is
it
not
possible
that
wynne
has
stumbled
upon
a
huge
deposit
of
diamonds
in
some
meteoric
substance
some
place
in
this
country
a
meteor
may
have
fallen
anywhere
of
course
and
it
may
have
been
only
two
months
ago
or
it
may
have
been
two
thousand
years
ago
it
may
even
be
buried
in
his
cellar
the
huge
german
nodded
his
head
vigorously
with
sparkling
eyes
it
seems
extremely
probable
that
if
diamond
fields
had
been
discovered
in
the
appalachian
range
czenki
went
on
it
would
have
become
public
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
prevent
it
whereas
it
is
possible
that
a
meteor
containing
diamonds
might
have
been
hidden
away
easily
and
also
the
production
of
diamonds
from
such
a
source
in
this
country
would
not
make
it
necessary
for
the
diamonds
to
pass
through
the
custom
house
is
it
clear
sir
why
it
absurd
fantastic
chimerical
latham
burst
out
irritably
it
ridiculous
to
consider
such
a
thing
i
beg
your
pardon
czenki
apologized
it
is
only
a
conjecture
of
course
i
may
add
that
i
do
believe
that
three
stones
of
the
size
of
the
replicas
which
wynne
produced
here
could
have
been
found
anywhere
in
the
world
and
brought
in
here
smuggled
in
or
in
the
usual
way
and
the
secret
held
against
the
thousands
of
men
who
daily
watch
the
diamond
fields
and
market
it
would
not
be
difficult
however
if
one
man
alone
knew
the
source
of
the
stones
to
keep
it
from
the
world
at
large
i
beg
your
pardon
he
added
he
arose
as
if
to
go
schultze
brought
a
heavy
hand
down
on
the
slim
shoulder
of
the
expert
and
turned
to
latham
laadham
you
are
listening
to
der
man
who
knows
more
as
all
of
us
pud
in
a
crowd
he
declared
i
do
believe
right
latham
was
a
cold
unimaginative
man
of
business
he
had
even
believed
in
fairies
when
he
was
a
boy
this
was
he
permitted
himself
to
express
his
opinion
by
a
jerk
of
his
head
and
was
silent
diamonds
like
those
out
of
meteors
bosh
chapter
ix
and
more
diamonds
there
was
a
rap
on
the
door
and
a
clerk
thrust
his
head
in
birnes
to
see
you
sir
he
announced
show
him
in
directed
latham
sit
down
both
of
you
and
let
see
what
he
has
to
say
there
was
an
odd
expression
of
hope
deferred
on
the
face
when
he
entered
he
glanced
inquiringly
at
schultze
and
czenki
whereupon
latham
introduced
them
you
may
talk
freely
he
added
we
are
all
interested
alike
the
detective
crossed
his
legs
and
balanced
his
hat
carefully
on
a
knee
the
while
he
favored
czenki
with
a
sharp
scrutiny
there
was
that
in
the
thin
scarred
face
and
in
the
beady
black
eyes
which
inevitably
drew
the
attention
of
a
stranger
and
half
a
dozen
times
as
he
talked
birnes
glanced
at
the
expert
he
retold
the
story
of
the
cab
ride
up
fifth
avenue
and
the
car
trip
back
downtown
omitting
embarrassing
details
such
as
the
finding
of
two
notes
addressed
to
himself
dwelt
a
moment
upon
the
empty
gripsack
which
wynne
carried
on
the
car
and
then
when
you
told
me
latham
that
the
gripsack
had
contained
diamonds
when
wynne
left
here
i
knew
instantly
how
he
got
rid
of
them
he
transferred
them
to
some
person
in
the
cab
in
accordance
with
a
carefully
prearranged
plan
that
person
was
a
woman
a
woman
latham
repeated
as
if
startled
dere
iss
alvays
wimmins
in
id
remarked
schultze
philosophically
go
on
birnes
was
not
at
all
backward
about
detailing
the
persistence
and
skill
it
had
required
on
his
part
to
establish
this
fact
and
he
went
on
at
length
to
acquaint
them
with
the
search
that
had
been
made
by
a
dozen
of
his
men
to
find
a
trace
of
the
woman
from
the
time
she
climbed
the
elevated
stairs
at
street
he
admitted
that
the
quest
for
her
had
thus
far
been
fruitless
assuring
them
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
go
steadily
on
for
the
present
at
least
and
now
latham
he
went
on
and
inadvertently
he
glanced
at
czenki
i
have
been
hampered
of
course
by
the
fact
that
you
have
not
taken
me
completely
into
your
confidence
in
this
matter
i
mean
he
added
hastily
that
beyond
a
mere
hint
of
their
value
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
diamonds
which
wynne
had
in
the
gripsack
i
gathered
however
that
they
were
worth
a
large
sum
of
money
perhaps
even
a
million
dollars
yah
a
million
dollars
ad
leasd
remarked
schultze
grimly
thank
you
and
the
detective
smiled
shrewdly
your
instructions
were
to
find
where
he
got
them
if
there
had
been
a
theft
of
a
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
anywhere
in
this
world
i
would
have
known
it
so
i
took
steps
to
examine
the
custom
house
records
of
this
and
other
cities
to
see
if
there
had
been
an
unusual
shipment
to
wynne
or
to
any
one
else
outside
of
the
diamond
dealers
thinking
this
might
give
me
a
clew
and
what
was
the
result
demanded
latham
quickly
my
agents
have
covered
all
the
atlantic
ports
and
they
did
not
come
in
through
the
custom
house
replied
birnes
i
have
not
heard
from
the
western
agents
as
yet
but
my
opinion
is
is
that
they
were
perhaps
smuggled
in
smuggling
after
all
is
simple
with
the
thousands
of
miles
of
unguarded
coasts
of
this
country
i
do
know
this
of
course
i
advance
it
merely
as
a
possibility
latham
turned
to
schultze
and
czenki
with
a
triumphant
smile
diamonds
in
meteors
tommyrot
of
course
the
detective
resumed
the
whole
investigation
centers
about
this
man
wynne
he
has
been
under
the
eyes
of
my
agents
as
no
other
man
ever
was
and
in
spite
of
this
has
been
able
to
keep
in
correspondence
with
his
accomplices
and
gentlemen
he
has
done
it
not
through
the
mails
not
over
the
telephone
not
by
telegraph
and
yet
he
has
done
it
by
wireless
perhaps
suggested
czenki
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
spoken
and
the
detective
took
occasion
then
and
there
to
stare
at
him
frankly
and
not
by
wireless
he
said
at
last
he
sends
and
receives
messages
from
the
roof
of
his
house
in
street
by
homing
pigeons
some
more
fandastics
eh
laadham
schultze
taunted
some
more
chimericals
i
demonstrate
this
much
by
the
close
watch
i
have
kept
of
wynne
the
detective
went
on
there
being
no
response
to
his
questioning
look
at
schultze
one
of
my
agents
stationed
on
the
roof
of
the
house
adjoining
wynne
it
was
the
next
door
has
on
at
least
one
occasion
seen
him
remove
a
strip
from
a
carrier
pigeon
leg
and
read
what
was
written
on
it
after
which
he
kissed
it
gentlemen
kissed
it
then
he
destroyed
it
what
did
it
mean
it
means
that
that
particular
message
was
from
the
girl
to
whom
he
transferred
the
diamonds
in
the
cab
and
that
he
is
madly
in
love
with
her
oh
dese
wimmins
i
dell
you
commented
schultze
there
was
a
little
pause
then
birnes
continued
impressively
this
correspondence
is
of
no
consequence
in
itself
of
course
but
it
gives
us
this
carrier
pigeons
will
only
fly
home
so
if
wynne
received
a
message
by
pigeon
it
means
that
at
some
time
within
a
week
say
he
has
shipped
that
pigeon
and
perhaps
others
from
the
house
in
street
to
that
person
who
sent
him
the
message
if
he
sends
messages
to
that
person
it
means
that
he
has
received
a
pigeon
or
pigeons
from
that
person
within
a
week
and
how
were
these
pigeons
shipped
in
all
probability
by
express
so
gentlemen
you
see
there
ought
to
be
a
record
in
the
express
offices
which
would
give
us
the
home
town
even
the
name
and
address
of
the
person
who
now
has
the
diamonds
in
his
or
her
keeping
is
that
clear
to
all
of
you
it
is
perfectly
clear
commented
laadham
admiringly
while
the
german
nodded
his
head
in
approval
and
that
is
the
clew
we
are
working
on
at
the
moment
the
detective
added
three
of
my
men
are
now
searching
the
records
of
all
the
express
companies
in
the
city
and
there
are
a
great
many
for
the
pigeon
shipments
if
as
seems
probable
this
clew
develops
it
may
be
that
we
can
place
our
hands
on
the
diamonds
within
a
few
days
i
don
i
vould
yust
blace
my
hands
on
dem
schultze
advised
dey
are
his
diamonds
you
know
und
your
hands
might
ged
in
drouble
i
mean
figuratively
of
course
the
detective
amended
he
stopped
and
drummed
on
his
stiff
hat
with
his
fingers
again
he
glanced
at
the
impassive
face
of
czenki
with
keen
questioning
eyes
and
for
one
bare
instant
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
trying
to
bring
his
memory
to
his
aid
i
found
out
all
about
this
man
wynne
he
supplemented
after
a
moment
but
nothing
in
his
record
seems
to
have
any
bearing
on
this
case
he
is
an
orphan
his
mother
was
a
van
cortlandt
of
old
dutch
stock
and
his
father
was
a
merchant
downtown
he
left
a
few
thousands
to
the
son
and
the
son
is
now
in
business
for
himself
with
an
office
in
lower
broad
street
he
is
an
importer
of
brown
sugar
brown
sugar
queried
czenki
quickly
and
the
thin
scarred
face
reflected
for
a
second
some
subtle
emotion
within
him
brown
sugar
he
repeated
yes
drawled
the
detective
with
an
unpleasant
stare
brown
sugar
he
imports
it
from
cuba
and
porto
rico
and
brazil
by
the
shipload
i
understand
and
makes
a
good
thing
of
it
a
quick
pallor
overspread
czenki
countenance
and
he
arose
with
his
fingers
working
nervously
his
beady
eyes
were
glittering
his
lips
were
pressed
together
until
they
were
bloodless
iss
demanded
schultze
curiously
my
god
gentlemen
do
you
see
the
expert
burst
out
violently
do
you
see
what
this
man
has
done
he
has
he
has
suddenly
by
a
supreme
effort
he
regained
control
of
himself
and
resumed
his
seat
he
has
what
asked
latham
for
half
a
minute
czenki
stared
at
his
employer
then
his
face
grew
impassive
again
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
quietly
wynne
is
a
heavy
importer
of
sugar
from
brazil
is
it
possible
that
those
brazilian
diamonds
that
new
workings
have
been
discovered
somewhere
in
the
interior
that
he
has
smuggled
them
in
concealed
in
the
right
into
new
york
under
the
noses
of
the
customs
officials
i
beg
your
pardon
he
concluded
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
a
drunken
man
unshaven
unkempt
unclean
and
clothed
in
rags
lurched
into
a
small
pawnshop
in
the
lower
bowery
and
planked
down
on
the
dirty
counter
a
handful
of
inert
colorless
pebbles
ranging
in
size
from
a
pea
to
a
peanut
say
jew
is
them
real
diamonds
he
demanded
thickly
the
man
in
charge
glanced
at
them
and
nearly
fainted
ten
minutes
later
red
haney
knight
of
the
road
was
placed
under
arrest
as
a
suspicious
character
uncut
diamonds
valued
roughly
at
fifty
thousand
dollars
were
found
in
his
possession
where
did
you
get
them
demanded
the
amazed
police
found
did
you
find
them
none
o
your
business
and
that
was
all
they
were
able
to
get
out
of
him
at
the
moment
chapter
x
the
big
game
when
the
police
of
mulberry
street
find
themselves
face
to
face
with
some
problem
other
than
the
trivial
theft
burglary
or
murder
as
the
case
may
be
they
are
wont
to
rise
up
and
run
around
in
a
circle
the
case
of
red
haney
and
the
diamonds
blared
to
the
world
at
large
in
the
newspapers
of
sunday
morning
immediately
precipitated
a
circular
parade
while
haney
the
objective
center
snored
along
peacefully
in
a
drunken
stupor
the
statement
of
the
case
in
the
public
press
was
altogether
negative
there
had
been
no
report
of
the
theft
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
uncut
diamonds
in
any
city
of
the
united
states
in
fact
diamonds
as
a
commodity
in
crime
had
not
figured
in
police
records
for
several
weeks
not
even
an
actress
had
mislaid
a
priceless
necklace
the
newspapers
were
unanimously
certain
that
stones
of
such
value
could
not
rightfully
belong
to
a
man
of
type
therefore
to
whom
they
belong
four
men
at
least
of
the
thousands
who
read
the
detailed
account
of
the
affair
sunday
morning
immediately
made
it
a
matter
of
personal
interest
to
themselves
one
of
these
was
latham
another
was
schultze
and
a
third
was
birnes
the
fourth
was
van
cortlandt
wynne
in
the
seclusion
of
his
home
in
street
wynne
read
the
story
with
puckered
brows
then
it
after
which
he
paced
back
and
forth
across
his
room
in
troubled
thought
for
an
hour
or
more
an
oppressive
sense
of
uneasiness
was
coming
over
him
and
it
was
reflected
in
eyes
grown
somber
after
a
time
with
sudden
determination
the
young
man
dropped
into
a
chair
at
his
desk
and
wrote
in
duplicate
on
a
narrow
strip
of
tough
just
one
line
are
you
safe
is
all
well
answer
quick
then
he
mounted
to
the
roof
as
he
flung
open
the
trap
a
man
on
the
top
of
the
house
next
door
darted
behind
a
chimney
wynne
saw
him
clearly
it
was
frank
claflin
but
he
seemed
to
consider
the
matter
of
no
consequence
for
he
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
instead
he
went
straight
to
a
cage
beside
the
wherein
a
dozen
or
more
birds
were
imprisoned
removed
one
of
them
attached
a
strip
of
the
to
its
leg
and
allowed
it
to
rise
from
his
hand
the
pigeon
darted
away
at
an
angle
up
up
until
it
grew
indistinct
against
the
void
then
swung
widely
in
a
semicircle
hovered
uncertainly
for
an
instant
and
flashed
off
to
the
west
straight
as
an
arrow
flies
wynne
watched
it
thoughtfully
until
it
had
disappeared
and
claflin
interest
was
so
intense
that
he
forgot
the
necessity
of
screening
himself
the
result
being
that
when
he
turned
again
toward
wynne
he
found
that
young
man
gazing
at
him
wynne
even
nodded
in
a
friendly
sort
of
way
as
he
attached
the
second
strip
of
tissue
to
the
leg
of
another
bird
this
rose
as
the
other
had
done
and
sped
away
toward
the
west
it
may
be
worth
your
while
to
know
claflin
wynne
remarked
easily
to
the
detective
on
the
other
house
that
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
on
this
roof
to
intercept
any
message
which
may
come
to
me
i
shall
shoot
you
then
he
turned
and
went
down
the
stairs
again
closing
and
locking
the
trap
in
the
roof
behind
him
he
should
get
an
answer
to
those
questions
in
two
hours
three
hours
at
the
most
if
there
was
no
answer
within
that
time
he
would
despatch
more
birds
and
if
no
answer
came
then
wynne
sat
down
and
carefully
perused
the
newspaper
story
again
at
just
about
that
moment
the
attention
of
one
john
sutton
another
of
the
watchful
birnes
men
on
duty
in
street
was
attracted
to
a
woman
who
had
turned
in
from
park
avenue
and
was
coming
rapidly
toward
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
she
was
young
with
the
elasticity
of
perfect
health
in
her
step
and
closely
veiled
she
wore
a
blue
gown
with
hat
to
match
and
recalcitrant
strands
of
hair
gleamed
a
golden
brown
by
george
exclaimed
the
detective
it
her
by
which
he
meant
that
the
mysterious
young
woman
of
the
cab
whose
description
had
been
drilled
into
him
by
birnes
had
at
last
reappeared
he
lounged
along
the
street
watching
her
with
keen
interest
fixing
her
every
detail
in
his
mind
she
did
not
hesitate
she
glanced
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
went
straight
to
the
house
occupied
by
wynne
and
rang
the
bell
a
moment
later
the
door
was
opened
and
she
disappeared
inside
the
detective
mopped
his
face
with
tremulous
joy
doris
exclaimed
wynne
as
the
veiled
girl
entered
the
room
where
he
sat
doris
my
dear
girl
what
you
doing
here
he
arose
and
went
toward
her
she
tore
off
the
heavy
veil
impatiently
and
lifted
her
moist
eyes
to
his
there
was
suffering
in
them
uneasiness
and
more
than
that
have
you
heard
from
him
out
there
she
demanded
not
no
he
responded
did
you
come
here
gene
i
ca
stand
it
she
burst
out
passionately
i
worried
to
death
i
ca
hear
a
word
and
i
worried
to
death
wynne
wondered
if
she
too
had
seen
the
morning
papers
he
stared
at
her
gravely
for
an
instant
then
turned
crumpled
up
the
section
of
newspaper
with
its
glaring
and
dropped
it
into
a
i
sorry
he
said
gently
i
telephoned
twice
yesterday
she
rushed
on
quickly
pleadingly
and
once
last
night
and
again
this
morning
there
was
no
no
answer
gene
i
could
stand
it
i
had
to
come
it
only
that
he
did
happen
to
be
within
hearing
of
the
telephone
bell
he
assured
her
but
her
steadfast
accusing
eyes
read
more
than
that
in
his
face
and
her
hands
trembled
on
his
arm
i
afraid
gene
i
afraid
she
declared
desperately
suppose
suppose
something
happened
it
absurd
and
he
attempted
to
laugh
off
her
uneasiness
why
nothing
could
have
happened
all
those
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
gene
she
reminded
him
and
he
is
i
should
have
left
him
alone
why
my
dear
doris
and
wynne
gathered
the
slender
trembling
figure
in
his
arms
protectingly
not
one
living
soul
except
you
and
i
knows
that
they
are
there
there
no
incentive
to
robbery
my
dear
a
poor
shabby
little
cottage
like
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
there
is
always
danger
gene
she
contradicted
it
makes
me
shudder
just
to
think
of
it
he
is
so
old
and
so
feeble
simple
as
a
child
and
utterly
helpless
if
anything
should
happen
then
when
i
did
hear
from
him
after
trying
so
many
times
over
the
telephone
i
afraid
gene
i
afraid
she
concluded
desperately
the
tears
came
and
she
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
he
stood
silent
with
narrowed
thoughtful
eyes
this
and
the
thing
in
the
newspaper
there
and
evidently
she
had
not
seen
that
it
was
not
wise
that
she
should
see
it
just
yet
that
day
i
took
the
horrid
things
from
you
in
the
cab
i
was
awfully
frightened
she
continued
sobbingly
i
felt
that
every
one
i
passed
knew
i
had
them
and
you
ca
imagine
what
a
relief
it
was
when
i
took
them
back
out
there
and
left
them
and
now
when
i
think
that
something
may
have
happened
to
she
paused
then
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
he
is
all
i
have
in
the
world
now
gene
except
you
already
the
hateful
things
have
cost
the
lives
of
my
father
and
my
brother
and
now
if
he
or
you
oh
my
god
it
would
kill
me
i
hate
them
hate
them
she
was
shaken
by
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
wynne
led
her
to
a
chair
and
she
dropped
into
it
wearily
with
her
face
in
her
hands
nothing
can
have
happened
doris
he
repeated
gently
i
sent
a
message
out
there
in
duplicate
only
a
few
minutes
ago
in
a
couple
of
hours
now
we
shall
be
getting
an
answer
now
do
begin
to
cry
he
added
helplessly
and
if
you
do
get
an
answer
she
insisted
i
shall
get
an
answer
he
declared
positively
there
was
a
long
pause
and
when
i
get
that
answer
doris
he
resumed
again
becoming
very
grave
you
will
see
how
unwise
how
dangerous
even
it
was
for
you
to
come
here
this
way
i
know
it
hard
dear
he
supplemented
apologetically
but
it
was
only
for
the
week
you
know
and
now
i
do
see
how
you
can
go
away
from
here
again
go
away
she
repeated
wonderingly
why
should
i
go
away
i
was
very
careful
to
veil
myself
when
i
came
no
one
saw
me
enter
i
am
sure
why
ca
i
go
away
again
wynne
paced
the
length
of
the
room
twice
with
troubled
brow
you
do
understand
dear
he
said
quietly
as
he
paused
before
her
from
the
moment
i
left
latham
office
last
thursday
i
have
been
under
constant
surveillance
i
followed
wherever
i
go
to
my
office
to
luncheon
to
the
theater
everywhere
and
day
and
night
day
and
night
there
are
two
men
watching
this
house
and
two
other
men
watching
at
my
office
they
tamper
with
my
correspondence
trace
my
telephone
calls
question
my
servants
quiz
my
clerks
you
do
understand
dear
he
said
again
but
why
should
they
do
all
this
she
asked
curiously
why
should
they
i
had
expected
it
all
of
course
he
interrupted
and
it
disturb
me
in
the
least
i
planned
for
months
to
anticipate
every
emergency
i
know
every
detective
who
is
watching
me
by
name
and
by
sight
and
all
my
plans
have
gone
perfectly
until
now
this
is
why
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
keep
away
from
out
there
as
it
was
for
you
to
keep
away
from
here
why
we
could
not
afford
to
take
chances
by
an
interchange
of
letters
or
by
telephone
calls
when
i
left
you
in
the
cab
i
knew
you
would
get
away
safely
because
they
did
not
know
you
were
there
in
the
first
place
and
then
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
chase
and
i
forced
them
to
center
their
attention
on
me
but
now
it
is
different
come
here
to
the
window
a
minute
he
led
her
across
the
room
unresistingly
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
staring
at
the
house
was
a
man
that
man
is
a
private
detective
wynne
informed
her
his
name
is
sutton
and
he
is
only
one
of
thirty
or
forty
whose
sole
business
in
life
right
now
is
to
watch
me
to
keep
track
of
and
follow
any
person
who
comes
here
he
saw
you
enter
and
you
could
escape
him
going
out
there
another
on
the
roof
of
the
house
next
door
his
name
is
claflin
these
men
or
others
from
the
same
agency
are
here
all
the
time
there
are
two
more
at
my
office
downtown
still
others
are
searching
customs
records
examining
the
books
of
the
express
companies
probing
into
my
private
affairs
and
they
all
in
the
employ
of
the
men
with
whom
i
am
dealing
do
you
understand
now
i
did
dream
of
such
a
thing
the
girl
faltered
slowly
i
knew
of
course
that
gene
i
should
have
come
if
if
only
i
could
have
heard
from
him
my
dear
girl
it
a
big
game
we
are
playing
a
game
and
we
shall
win
it
unless
we
win
it
in
spite
of
them
naturally
the
diamond
dealers
do
want
to
be
compelled
to
put
up
one
hundred
million
dollars
they
reason
that
if
the
stones
i
showed
them
came
from
new
fields
and
the
supply
is
unlimited
as
i
told
them
that
the
diamond
market
is
on
the
verge
of
collapse
anyway
and
as
they
look
at
it
they
are
compelled
to
know
where
they
came
from
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
they
did
know
or
if
the
public
got
one
inkling
of
the
truth
the
diamond
market
would
be
wrecked
and
all
the
diamond
dealers
in
the
world
working
together
could
prevent
it
if
they
succeed
in
doing
this
thing
they
feel
they
must
do
they
will
only
bring
disaster
upon
themselves
it
would
do
no
good
to
tell
them
so
i
merely
laid
my
plans
and
am
letting
them
alone
so
you
see
my
dear
it
is
a
big
game
a
big
game
chapter
xi
the
silent
bell
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
earnest
thoughtful
eyes
suddenly
the
within
her
awoke
in
a
surging
inexplicable
wave
of
emotion
which
almost
overcame
her
and
after
it
came
something
of
realization
of
the
great
fight
he
was
making
for
her
for
her
and
the
aged
feeble
grandfather
waiting
patiently
out
there
he
loved
her
this
master
among
men
and
she
sighed
contentedly
for
the
moment
the
maddening
anxiety
that
brought
her
here
was
forgotten
there
was
only
the
ineffable
sweetness
of
seeing
him
again
she
extended
her
hands
to
him
impulsively
and
he
kissed
them
both
the
difficulty
of
you
leaving
here
he
went
on
after
a
little
is
that
you
would
be
followed
and
within
two
hours
these
men
would
know
all
about
you
where
you
are
stopping
how
long
you
have
been
there
they
would
know
of
your
daily
telephone
messages
to
your
grandfather
and
then
inevitably
they
would
appear
out
there
and
learn
all
the
rest
of
it
it
does
matter
how
closely
they
keep
watch
of
me
my
plans
are
all
made
i
know
i
am
watched
and
make
no
mistakes
but
you
so
i
should
not
have
come
she
questioned
i
sorry
i
understand
your
anxiety
of
course
he
assured
her
and
he
was
smiling
a
little
but
the
worst
never
happens
so
for
the
present
we
will
not
worry
in
an
hour
or
more
now
i
imagine
we
shall
receive
a
which
will
show
that
all
is
well
and
then
i
shall
have
to
plan
for
you
to
get
away
somehow
she
leaned
toward
him
a
little
and
again
he
gathered
her
in
his
arms
the
red
lips
were
mutely
raised
and
he
kissed
her
reverently
it
all
for
you
and
it
will
all
be
right
he
assured
her
gene
dear
gene
he
pressed
a
button
on
the
wall
and
a
maid
appeared
you
will
have
to
wait
for
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
at
least
so
if
you
would
like
to
take
off
your
things
he
suggested
with
grave
courtesy
i
dare
say
the
suite
just
above
is
habitable
and
the
maid
is
at
your
service
the
girl
regarded
him
pensively
for
a
moment
then
turning
ran
swiftly
up
the
stairs
the
maid
started
to
follow
more
staidly
just
a
moment
said
wynne
crisply
in
an
undertone
miss
kellner
is
not
to
be
allowed
to
use
the
telephone
under
any
circumstances
you
understand
she
nodded
silently
and
went
up
the
stairs
an
hour
passed
from
the
swivel
chair
at
his
desk
wynne
had
twice
seen
sutton
stroll
past
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
then
claflin
had
lounged
along
suddenly
he
arose
and
went
to
the
window
throwing
back
the
curtains
sutton
was
leaning
against
an
pole
half
a
block
away
claflin
was
half
a
block
off
in
the
other
direction
in
casual
conversation
with
a
policeman
wynne
looked
them
over
thoughtfully
curiously
enough
he
was
wondering
just
how
he
would
fare
in
a
physical
contest
with
either
or
both
he
turned
away
from
the
window
at
last
and
glanced
at
his
watch
impatiently
one
hour
and
forty
minutes
in
another
half
an
hour
the
little
bell
over
his
desk
should
ring
that
would
mean
that
a
pigeon
had
arrived
from
from
out
there
and
that
the
automatic
door
had
closed
upon
it
as
it
entered
the
cote
but
if
it
did
come
if
it
did
come
then
what
there
was
only
one
conclusion
to
be
drawn
and
he
shuddered
a
little
when
he
thought
of
it
there
could
only
remain
this
single
possibility
when
he
considered
the
sinister
things
that
had
happened
the
failure
of
the
girl
to
get
an
answer
by
telephone
and
the
unexpected
appearance
of
red
haney
with
the
uncut
diamonds
it
might
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
out
there
and
how
could
he
do
it
how
without
leaving
an
open
trail
behind
him
how
without
inviting
defeat
in
the
fight
he
was
making
his
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
miss
kellner
she
had
crept
down
the
stairs
noiselessly
and
stood
beside
him
before
he
was
aware
of
her
presence
her
eyes
sought
his
countenance
questioningly
and
the
deadly
pallor
of
her
face
frightened
him
she
crept
into
his
arms
and
nestled
there
silently
with
dry
staring
eyes
he
stroked
the
hair
with
an
utter
sense
of
helplessness
nothing
yet
he
said
finally
and
there
was
a
thin
assumption
of
cheeriness
in
his
tone
it
may
be
another
hour
but
it
will
come
it
will
come
but
if
it
does
gene
she
queried
insistently
always
her
mind
went
back
to
that
possibility
we
shall
cross
no
bridges
until
we
reach
them
he
replied
there
is
always
a
chance
that
the
pigeons
might
have
gone
astray
for
they
have
this
single
disadvantage
against
the
incalculable
advantage
of
offering
no
clew
to
any
one
as
to
where
they
go
and
it
is
impossible
to
follow
them
if
nothing
comes
in
half
an
hour
now
i
shall
send
two
more
and
then
if
nothing
comes
then
my
dear
then
we
shall
begin
to
worry
half
an
hour
passed
the
little
bell
was
silent
claflin
and
sutton
were
still
visible
from
the
window
miss
kellner
eyes
were
immovably
fixed
on
wynne
face
and
he
repressed
his
gnawing
anxiety
with
an
effort
finally
he
wrote
again
on
the
tissue
slips
three
of
them
this
time
and
together
they
climbed
to
the
roof
attached
the
messages
and
watched
the
birds
disappear
another
hour
two
hours
two
hours
and
a
half
passed
suddenly
the
girl
arose
with
pallid
face
and
colorless
lips
i
ca
stand
it
gene
i
ca
she
exclaimed
hysterically
i
must
know
the
telephone
no
he
commanded
harshly
and
he
too
arose
no
i
will
she
flashed
she
darted
out
of
the
room
and
along
the
hall
he
followed
her
with
grim
determination
in
his
face
she
seized
the
receiver
from
the
hook
and
held
it
to
her
ear
hello
called
central
give
me
long
distance
coaldale
number
no
commanded
wynne
and
he
placed
one
hand
over
the
transmitter
tightly
doris
you
must
not
i
will
she
flamed
let
me
alone
you
ruin
everything
he
pleaded
earnestly
do
you
know
that
they
get
every
number
i
call
do
you
know
that
within
fifteen
minutes
they
will
have
that
number
and
their
men
will
start
for
there
she
faced
him
with
blazing
eyes
i
do
care
she
said
deliberately
and
the
white
face
was
relieved
by
an
angry
flush
i
will
know
what
has
happened
out
there
i
must
gene
do
you
see
that
i
frantic
with
anxiety
the
money
means
nothing
to
me
i
want
to
know
if
he
is
safe
his
hand
was
still
gripped
over
the
transmitter
suddenly
she
turned
and
tugged
at
it
fiercely
her
sharp
little
nails
bit
into
the
flesh
of
his
fingers
in
a
last
desperate
effort
she
placed
the
receiver
to
her
lips
give
me
long
distance
coaldale
number
with
a
quick
movement
he
snapped
the
connecting
wire
from
the
instrument
and
the
receiver
was
free
in
her
hand
doris
you
are
mad
he
protested
wait
a
minute
my
dear
girl
just
a
minute
i
do
care
i
know
wynne
turned
and
picked
up
a
heavy
cane
from
the
and
brought
it
down
on
the
transmitter
with
all
his
strength
the
delicate
mechanism
jangled
and
tingled
then
the
front
fell
off
at
their
feet
the
diaphragm
dropped
and
rolled
away
doris
you
must
not
he
commanded
again
gravely
we
will
find
another
way
dear
how
dare
you
she
demanded
violently
it
was
cowardly
you
do
understand
i
understand
it
all
she
broke
in
i
understand
that
this
might
lead
to
the
failure
of
the
thing
you
are
trying
to
do
but
i
care
i
understand
that
already
i
have
lost
my
father
and
my
brother
in
this
that
my
grandmother
and
my
mother
were
nearly
starved
to
death
while
it
was
all
being
planned
all
for
these
hideous
diamonds
diamonds
diamonds
diamonds
i
heard
nothing
all
my
life
but
that
as
a
child
it
was
dinned
into
me
and
now
i
am
sick
and
weary
of
it
all
i
know
i
something
has
happened
to
him
now
i
hate
them
i
hate
them
she
stopped
glared
at
him
with
scornful
eyes
for
an
instant
then
ran
up
the
stairs
again
wynne
touched
a
button
in
the
wall
and
the
maid
appeared
go
lock
the
back
door
and
bring
me
the
key
he
commanded
the
maid
went
away
and
a
moment
later
returned
to
hand
him
the
key
he
still
stood
in
the
hall
waiting
after
a
little
there
came
a
rush
of
skirts
and
miss
kellner
ran
down
the
steps
dressed
for
the
street
doris
he
pleaded
you
must
not
go
out
now
wait
just
a
moment
we
find
a
way
and
then
i
go
with
you
she
tried
to
pass
him
but
his
outstretched
arms
made
her
a
prisoner
do
i
understand
that
you
refuse
to
let
me
go
she
asked
tensely
not
like
this
he
replied
if
you
give
me
just
a
little
while
then
perhaps
perhaps
i
may
go
with
you
even
if
something
had
happened
there
you
could
do
nothing
alone
i
too
am
afraid
now
just
half
an
hour
fifteen
minutes
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
find
a
plan
suddenly
she
sank
down
on
the
stairs
with
her
face
in
her
hands
he
caressed
her
hair
tenderly
then
raised
her
to
her
feet
suppose
you
step
into
the
back
parlor
here
he
requested
just
give
me
fifteen
minutes
then
unless
i
can
find
a
way
for
us
to
go
together
safely
we
will
throw
everything
aside
and
go
anyway
forgive
me
dear
she
submitted
quietly
to
be
led
along
the
hall
he
opened
the
door
into
a
room
and
stood
aside
for
her
to
pass
gene
gene
she
exclaimed
her
soft
arms
found
their
way
about
his
neck
and
she
drew
his
face
down
and
kissed
him
then
without
a
word
she
entered
the
room
and
closed
the
door
a
minute
passed
two
four
five
and
wynne
stood
as
she
left
him
then
he
opened
the
front
door
and
stepped
out
frank
claflin
was
just
starting
toward
the
house
from
the
corner
with
deliberate
pace
when
he
glanced
up
and
saw
wynne
signaling
for
him
to
approach
could
it
be
possible
he
had
had
no
orders
about
talking
to
this
man
but
perhaps
he
was
going
to
give
it
up
and
with
this
idea
he
accelerated
his
pace
and
crossed
the
street
oh
claflin
will
you
step
in
just
a
moment
please
requested
wynne
courteously
why
demanded
the
detective
suspiciously
there
a
matter
i
want
to
discuss
with
you
responded
wynne
it
may
be
that
we
can
reach
some
sort
of
of
an
agreement
about
this
and
if
you
do
mind
claflin
went
up
the
steps
wynne
ushered
him
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
three
minutes
later
wynne
appeared
on
the
steps
again
and
beckoned
to
sutton
who
had
just
witnessed
the
incident
just
preceding
and
was
positively
being
eaten
by
curiosity
this
is
sutton
is
it
inquired
wynne
yes
that
me
well
claflin
and
i
are
discussing
this
matter
and
my
proposition
to
him
was
such
that
he
felt
if
must
be
made
in
your
presence
would
you
mind
stepping
inside
for
a
moment
you
and
the
girl
decided
to
give
it
up
queried
sutton
triumphantly
we
are
just
discussing
the
matter
now
was
the
answer
sutton
went
up
the
steps
and
disappeared
inside
and
about
four
minutes
after
that
wynne
stood
in
the
hallway
puffing
a
little
as
he
readjusted
his
necktie
he
picked
up
his
hat
drew
on
his
gloves
and
then
rapped
on
the
door
of
the
back
parlor
miss
kellner
appeared
we
will
go
now
said
wynne
quietly
but
is
it
safe
gene
she
asked
quickly
perfectly
safe
yes
there
no
danger
of
being
followed
if
we
go
immediately
she
gazed
at
him
wonderingly
then
followed
him
to
the
door
he
opened
it
and
she
passed
out
glancing
around
curiously
for
one
instant
he
paused
and
there
came
a
clatter
and
clamor
from
somewhere
in
the
rear
of
the
house
he
closed
the
door
with
a
grim
smile
which
are
the
detectives
asked
miss
kellner
in
an
awed
whisper
i
do
see
them
around
just
now
he
replied
we
can
get
a
cab
at
the
corner
chapter
xii
the
third
degree
some
years
ago
a
famous
head
of
the
police
department
clearly
demonstrated
the
superiority
of
a
blow
frequently
administered
as
against
moral
suasion
and
from
that
moment
the
third
degree
became
an
institution
whatever
sort
of
criticism
may
be
made
of
the
third
degree
it
is
nevertheless
amazingly
effective
and
beyond
that
affords
infinite
satisfaction
to
the
administrator
there
is
a
certain
vicious
delight
in
brutally
smashing
a
sullen
helpless
prisoner
in
the
face
and
the
third
degree
is
not
officially
in
existence
red
haney
was
submitted
to
the
third
degree
his
argument
that
he
found
the
diamonds
and
that
having
found
them
they
were
his
until
the
proper
owner
appeared
was
futile
ten
minutes
after
having
passed
into
a
room
where
sat
chief
arkwright
of
the
mulberry
street
force
and
three
of
his
men
and
steven
birnes
of
the
birnes
detective
agency
haney
remembered
that
he
had
found
the
diamonds
at
all
somebody
had
given
them
to
him
who
gave
them
to
you
demanded
the
chief
i
do
know
the
guy
name
boss
haney
replied
humbly
this
is
to
remind
you
of
it
haney
found
himself
sprawling
on
the
floor
and
looked
up
with
a
pleading
piteous
expression
his
eyes
were
still
red
and
bleary
his
motley
face
shot
with
purple
and
the
fumes
of
the
liquor
still
clouded
his
brain
the
chief
stood
above
him
with
clenched
fist
on
the
level
boss
i
do
know
he
whined
get
up
commanded
the
chief
haney
struggled
to
his
feet
and
dropped
into
his
chair
what
does
he
look
like
this
man
who
gave
them
to
you
where
did
you
meet
him

he
give
them
to
you

pleaded

any
more
an
i

about

the
chief
sat
down
again
with
scowling
face
haney
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
he
a
little
skinny
feller
boss
the
prisoner
went
on
to
explain
the
while
he
thoughtfully
caressed
his
jaw

to
see
it
all

while
he
goes
in
an

the
old
nut
a
gentle
tap
on
the
coco
an
cops
the
sparks
that
what
we
done
i
goes
up
takes
a
few
looks
aroun
then
i
whistles
an
he
appears
from
the
back
an
goes
up
to
the
kitchen
for
a
handout
the
old
guy
opens
the
door
an
he
goes
in
about
a
minute
later
he
comes
out
gives
me
a
handful
o
little
rocks

i

an

i
guess
i
lit
up
good
if
i
been
right
i
would
went
to
the
an
got
pinched
he
glanced
around
at
the
five
other
men
in
the
room
and
he
read
belief
in
each
face
whereupon
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
what
town
was
it
asked
the
chief
little
place
named
coaldale
coaldale
the
chief
repeated
thoughtfully
where
is
that
about
forty
or
fifty
miles
jersey
said
haney
i
know
the
place
remarked
birnes
you
are
sure
haney
said
the
chief
after
a
pause
you
are
sure
you
do
know
this
other
man
name
i
do
know
it
boss
who
was
the
man
you
robbed
i
do
know
the
chief
arose
quickly
and
the
prisoner
cringed
in
his
seat
i
do
know
he
went
on
protestingly
do
hit
me
again
but
the
chief
had
no
such
intention
it
was
merely
to
walk
back
and
forth
across
the
room
what
kind
of
man
was
he
a
tramp
haney
faltered
and
thoughtfully
pulled
his
the
cunning
brain
behind
the
bleary
eyes
was
working
now
i
would
call
him
a
tramp
he
said
evasively
he
had
on
collar
an
cuffs
an
good
clothes
an
talked
sort
o
easy
little
skinny
man
you
said
what
color
was
his
hair
the
chief
turned
in
his
tracks
and
regarded
haney
with
keen
inquiring
eyes
the
prisoner
withstood
the
scrutiny
bravely
sort
o
blackish
brownish
hair
black
you
mean
well
yes
black
and
his
eyes
black
eyes
little
an
round
like
gimlet
holes
heavy
eyebrows
i
suppose
yes
haney
agreed
readily
they
sort
o
stuck
out
and
his
nose
big
or
little
heavy
or
thin
haney
considered
that
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
then
sort
o
medium
nose
boss
with
a
point
on
it
and
a
thin
face
naturally
how
much
did
he
weigh
oh
he
was
a
little
feller
skinny
you
know
i
reckon
he
weigh
no
a
hundred
an
or
thirty
some
germ
had
been
born
in
the
fertile
mind
of
birnes
now
it
burst
into
maturity
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
stared
coldly
at
haney
perhaps
he
suggested
slowly
perhaps
he
had
a
scar
on
his
face
haney
returned
the
gaze
dully
for
an
instant
then
suddenly
he
nodded
his
head
yes
a
scar
he
said
from
here
birnes
placed
one
finger
on
the
point
of
his
chin
and
drew
it
across
his
right
jaw
yes
a
scar
that
it
the
prisoner
acquiesced
from
his
chin
almost
around
to
his
ear
birnes
came
to
his
feet
while
the
official
police
stared
the
chief
sat
down
again
and
crossed
his

appears
half
an
hour
later
birnes
chief
arkwright
and
detective
sergeant
connelly
were
on
a
train
bound
for
coaldale
birnes
had
left
them
for
a
moment
at
the
ferry
and
rushed
into
a
telephone
booth
when
he
came
out
he
was
exuberantly
triumphant
it
my
man
all
right
he
assured
the
chief
he
has
been
missing
since
friday
night
and
no
one
knows
his
whereabouts
it
my
man
it
was
an
hour
ride
to
coaldale
a
sprawling
straggly
village
with
only
four
or
five
houses
in
sight
from
the
station
when
the
three
men
left
the
train
there
birnes
walked
over
and
spoke
to
the
agent
a
thin
cadaverous
specimen
of
his
species
we
are
looking
for
an
old
gentleman
who
lives
out
here
somewhere
he
explained
he
probably
lives
alone
and
we
been
told
that
he
has
a
little
cottage
somewhere
over
this
way
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
to
the
right
in
accordance
with
the
directions
of
red
haney
the
station
agent
scratched
his
stubbly
chin
and
spat
with
great
accuracy
through
a
ten
feet
away
you
mean
old
man
kellner
he
replied
obligingly
he
lives
by
hisself
part
of
the
time
then
again
sometimes
his
lives
with
him
granddaughter
birnes
almost
jumped
a
granddaughter
yes
he
said
with
a
forced
calm
rather
a
pretty
girl
or
three
years
old
sometimes
she
dresses
in
blue
yes
the
agent
agreed
them
them
follow
the
road
there
till
you
come
to
widow
gardiner
then
turn
to
your
left
and
it
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
the
only
house
up
that
way
you
ca
miss
it
the
agent
stood
squinting
at
them
with
friendly
inquiry
radiating
from
his
countenance
and
birnes
took
an
opportunity
to
ask
some
other
questions
by
the
way
what
sort
of
old
man
is
this
kellner
what
does
he
do
is
he
wealthy
a
pleasant
grin
overspread
his
informant
face
one
finger
was
raised
to
his
head
and
twirled
significantly
he
crazy
he
went
on
to
explain
do
do
nothing
so
far
as
nobody
knows
lives
like
a
hermit
stays
in
the
house
all
the
time
and
has
long
whiskers
do
know
whether
he
rich
or
not
but
he
ai
becuz
no
man
with
money
live
like
he
does
he
thrust
a
long
forefinger
into
birnes
face
and
stingy
so
stingy
he
wo
let
nobody
come
in
the
house
scared
they
wear
the
furniture
out
looking
at
it
how
long
has
he
lived
here
there
ai
nobody
in
this
town
old
enough
to
say
why
mister
i
bet
that
old
man
a
thousand
years
old
wait
you
see
him
that
was
all
they
went
on
as
indicated
the
very
type
of
man
who
would
scrimp
and
starve
to
put
all
his
money
in
something
like
diamonds
mused
chief
arkwright
the
usual
rich
old
miser
who
winds
up
by
being
murdered
they
passed
the
widow
gardiner
and
came
into
a
pleasant
country
road
which
turning
brought
them
to
a
shabby
little
cottage
embowered
in
trees
through
the
foliage
farther
on
they
caught
the
amber
gleam
of
a
languid
river
and
around
their
feet
as
they
entered
the
yard
scores
of
pigeons
fluttered
carriers
ejaculated
birnes
as
if
startled
with
a
strange
feeling
of
elation
the
detective
led
the
way
up
the
steps
to
the
veranda
and
knocked
there
was
no
answer
he
glanced
at
the
chief
significantly
and
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
try
the
back
door
directed
chief
arkwright
tersely
if
locked
we
go
in
anyway
they
passed
around
the
house
to
the
rear
and
birnes
laid
one
hand
upon
the
he
turned
it
and
the
door
swung
inward
again
he
glanced
at
chief
arkwright
the
chief
nodded
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
they
stood
in
a
kitchen
clean
as
to
floors
and
tables
but
now
in
the
utmost
disorder
they
spent
only
a
moment
here
then
passed
into
the
narrow
hall
along
this
to
a
door
that
stood
open
and
then
then
chief
arkwright
paused
staring
downward
and
respectfully
lifted
his
hat
always
the
same
he
remarked
enigmatically
birnes
thrust
himself
forward
and
through
the
door
on
the
floor
with
white
face
turned
upward
and
fixed
staring
eyes
lay
an
old
man
his
venerable
gray
hair
long
and
unkempt
fell
back
from
a
brow
of
noble
proportions
the
wide
high
brow
of
the
student
and
a
great
beard
rippled
down
over
his
breast
save
for
the
glassiness
of
the
eyes
the
face
was
placid
in
death
even
as
it
must
have
been
in
life
mutely
birnes
examined
the
body
a
blow
in
the
back
of
the
head
that
was
all
then
he
glanced
around
the
room
inquiringly
everything
was
in
order
except
except
here
lay
an
overturned
he
picked
it
up
two
uncut
diamonds
were
on
the
floor
beneath
it
the
rough
inert
pebbles
silently
attested
the
obvious
manner
of
death
which
simultaneously
forced
itself
upon
the
three
men
the
cowardly
blow
of
an
assassin
a
dying
struggle
perhaps
for
the
contents
of
the
box
and
this
the
end
from
outside
came
sharply
in
the
silence
the
rattle
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
of
the
road
and
a
vehicle
stopped
in
front
of
the
door
warned
the
chief
some
one
came
along
the
walk
up
the
steps
and
rapped
briskly
on
the
door
the
detectives
waited
motionless
silent
the
knob
rattled
under
impatient
fingers
then
the
footsteps
passed
along
the
veranda
quickly
and
were
lost
as
if
some
one
had
stepped
off
at
the
end
intending
to
come
to
the
back
door
which
was
open
a
moment
later
they
heard
steps
in
the
kitchen
then
in
the
narrow
hall
approaching
and
the
doorway
of
the
room
where
they
stood
framed
the
figure
of
a
man
it
was
czenki
there
your
man
chief
remarked
birnes
quietly
the
diamond
expert
permitted
his
gaze
to
wander
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
men
and
then
the
beady
black
eyes
came
to
rest
on
the
silent
outstretched
figure
of
the
old
man
he
started
forward
impulsively
the
grip
of
connelly
on
his
arm
stopped
him
you
my
prisoner
yes
i
understand
said
czenki
impatiently
he
did
even
look
up
he
was
still
gazing
at
the
figure
on
the
floor
well
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
demanded
chief
arkwright
coldly
czenki
met
the
accusing
stare
of
the
chief
squarely
for
an
instant
then
the
keen
eyes
shifted
to
the
slightly
flushed
face
of
birnes
and
lingered
there
interrogatively
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
he
replied
at
last
and
he
drew
one
hand
slowly
across
his
thin
scarred
face
yes
i
understand
he
repeated
absently
i
have
nothing
to
say
chapter
xiv
caught
in
the
net
doris
looked
down
in
great
horror
upon
the
body
of
this
withered
old
man
whom
she
had
loved
and
the
thin
thread
of
life
within
her
all
but
snapped
it
had
come
the
premonition
of
disaster
had
been
fulfilled
the
last
of
her
blood
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
mercilessly
glittering
diamonds
father
brother
and
now
him
wynne
face
went
white
and
his
teeth
closed
fiercely
he
had
loved
this
old
man
too
then
the
shock
passed
and
he
turned
anxiously
to
doris
to
receive
the
limp
inert
figure
in
his
arms
she
had
fainted
well
what
do
know
about
it
inquired
chief
arkwright
abruptly
wynne
was
himself
again
instantly
the
calm
perfectly
poised
young
man
of
affairs
he
glanced
at
the
chief
then
shot
a
quick
inquiring
look
at
czenki
almost
imperceptibly
the
diamond
expert
shook
his
head
then
eyes
turned
upon
birnes
there
had
been
triumph
in
the
detective
face
until
that
moment
but
under
the
steady
meaning
glare
which
was
directed
at
him
triumph
faded
to
a
sort
of
wonder
followed
by
a
vague
sense
of
uneasiness
and
he
read
a
command
in
the
fixed
eyes
a
command
to
silence
curiously
enough
it
reminded
him
that
he
was
in
the
employ
of
latham
and
that
there
were
certain
business
secrets
to
be
protected
he
regarded
the
physician
hastily
summoned
for
a
perfunctory
examination
well
demanded
the
chief
again
nothing
of
this
replied
wynne
i
think
doctor
and
he
addressed
the
physician
that
she
needs
you
more
than
he
does
we
know
only
too
well
what
the
matter
with
him
the
physician
arose
obediently
wynne
gathered
up
the
slender
still
figure
in
his
arms
and
bore
it
away
to
another
room
the
doctor
bent
over
doris
and
tested
the
fluttering
heart
only
shock
he
said
finally
when
he
looked
up
she
come
round
all
right
in
a
little
while
thank
god
the
young
man
breathed
softly
he
stooped
and
pressed
reverent
lips
to
the
brow
then
straightened
up
and
after
one
long
lingering
look
at
her
turned
quickly
and
left
the
room
i
have
no
statement
to
make
czenki
was
saying
in
that
level
unemotional
way
of
his
when
wynne
reentered
the
room
where
lay
the
dead
we
are
to
assume
that
you
are
guilty
then
demanded
chief
arkwright
with
cold
finality
i
have
nothing
to
say
replied
the
expert
his
gaze
met
that
of
wynne
for
a
moment
then
settled
on
the
venerable
face
of
the
old
man
guilty
interposed
wynne
quickly
guilty
of
what
chief
arkwright
without
speaking
waved
his
hand
toward
the
body
on
the
floor
there
was
a
flash
of
amazement
in
the
young
man
face
a
sudden
bewilderment
the
diamond
expert
countenance
was
expressionless
you
do
deny
that
you
killed
him
persisted
the
chief
accusingly
i
have
nothing
to
say
said
the
expert
again
and
you
do
deny
that
you
were
red
haney
accomplice
i
have
nothing
to
say
was
the
monotonous
answer
the
chief
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
some
illuminating
thought
shone
for
an
instant
in
wynne
clear
eyes
and
he
nodded
as
if
a
question
in
his
mind
had
been
answered
perhaps
chief
there
may
be
some
mistake
he
protested
perhaps
this
gentleman
what
motive
would
there
motive
enough
interrupted
the
chief
briskly
we
have
this
man
description
straight
from
his
accomplice
red
haney
even
to
the
scar
on
his
face
he
paused
abruptly
and
regarded
wynne
through
lids
by
the
way
he
continued
deliberately
who
are
what
do
know
about
it
my
name
is
wynne
van
cortlandt
wynne
was
the
ready
response
i
am
directly
interested
in
this
case
through
a
friendship
for
kellner
here
and
through
the
additional
fact
that
his
granddaughter
in
the
adjoining
room
is
soon
to
become
my
wife
there
was
a
little
pause
i
may
add
that
i
live
in
new
york
and
that
miss
kellner
has
been
stopping
there
for
several
days
she
has
been
accustomed
to
hearing
from
her
grandfather
at
least
once
a
day
by
telephone
but
she
was
unable
to
get
an
answer
either
yesterday
or
so
she
came
to
my
home
and
together
we
came
out
here
birnes
looked
up
quickly
it
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
claflin
and
sutton
who
had
been
on
watch
at
the
street
house
the
young
man
interpreted
the
expression
of
his
face
aright
and
favored
him
with
a
meaning
glance
we
came
alone
he
supplemented
birnes
silently
pondered
it
all
that
being
true
chief
arkwright
suggested
tentatively
perhaps
you
can
give
us
some
information
as
to
the
diamonds
that
were
stolen
how
much
were
they
worth
how
many
were
there
he
held
up
the
uncut
stones
that
had
been
found
on
the
floor
i
do
know
their
exact
number
was
the
reply
their
value
i
should
say
was
about
sixty
thousand
dollars
except
for
this
little
house
and
the
grounds
adjoining
practically
all
of
money
was
invested
in
diamonds
those
you
have
there
are
part
of
an
accumulation
of
many
years
imported
in
the
rough
one
or
two
at
a
time
czenki
was
gazing
abstractedly
out
of
a
window
but
the
expression
on
his
lean
face
indicated
the
keenest
interest
and
and
something
else
apprehension
maybe
the
chief
stared
straight
into
the
young
man
eyes
for
an
instant
and
then
and
kellner
family
he
inquired
there
is
no
one
except
his
granddaughter
doris
some
change
sudden
as
it
was
pronounced
came
over
the
chief
and
his
whole
attitude
altered
he
dropped
into
a
chair
near
the
door
have
a
seat
wynne
he
invited
courteously
and
understand
this
thing
clearly
over
there
please
and
he
indicated
a
chair
partly
facing
that
in
which
czenki
sat
wynne
sat
down
now
you
do
seem
to
believe
the
chief
went
on
pleasantly
that
czenki
here
killed
mr
kellner
well
no
the
young
man
admitted
czenki
glanced
at
him
quickly
warningly
the
chief
was
not
looking
but
he
knew
the
glance
had
passed
and
do
you
believe
it
he
continued
in
the
first
place
wynne
began
without
hesitation
the
diamonds
were
worth
only
about
sixty
thousand
dollars
and
czenki
here
draws
a
salary
of
thousand
dollars
a
year
the
proportion
is
wrong
you
see
again
czenki
is
a
man
of
unquestioned
integrity
as
diamond
expert
of
the
henry
latham
company
he
handles
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
precious
stones
each
year
and
has
practically
unlimited
opportunities
for
theft
without
murder
if
he
were
seeking
to
steal
he
has
been
with
that
company
for
several
years
and
that
fact
alone
is
certainly
to
his
credit
very
good
commented
the
chief
ambiguously
he
paused
an
instant
to
study
this
little
man
with
an
interest
aroused
by
the
sum
of
his
salary
and
what
of
haney
description
his
accusation
he
asked
haney
might
have
lied
you
know
retorted
wynne
men
in
his
position
have
been
known
to
lie
i
understood
you
to
say
the
chief
resumed
heedless
of
the
note
of
irony
in
the
other
voice
that
you
and
miss
kellner
are
to
be
married
yes
and
that
she
is
the
only
heir
of
her
grandfather
yes
therefore
at
his
death
the
diamonds
would
become
her
property
for
one
instant
wynne
seemed
startled
and
turned
his
clear
eyes
full
upon
his
interrogator
seeking
the
hidden
meaning
yes
but
he
began
slowly
that
true
is
it
demanded
the
chief
with
quick
violence
yes
that
true
wynne
admitted
calmly
therefore
indirectly
it
would
have
been
to
advantage
if
kellner
had
died
or
had
been
killed
in
that
the
diamonds
would
have
come
to
my
intended
wife
yes
was
the
reply
czenki
clasped
and
unclasped
his
thin
hands
nervously
his
face
was
again
expressionless
and
the
beady
eyes
were
fastened
immovably
on
chief
arkwright
birnes
was
frankly
amazed
at
this
unexpected
turn
of
the
affair
suddenly
chief
arkwright
brought
his
hand
down
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
a
bang
suppose
for
the
moment
that
red
haney
lied
and
that
czenki
is
the
murderer
then
as
a
matter
of
fact
salary
thousand
a
year
is
it
he
was
on
his
feet
now
with
blazing
eyes
and
one
hand
was
thrust
accusingly
into
wynne
face
it
was
simulation
birnes
understood
it
a
police
method
of
exhausting
possibilities
there
was
not
the
slightest
movement
by
wynne
to
indicate
uneasiness
at
the
charge
not
a
tremor
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
again
i
understand
perfectly
chief
he
remarked
coldly
just
what
was
the
time
of
the
crime
may
i
ask
answer
my
question
insisted
the
chief
thunderously
now
look
here
chief
wynne
went
on
frigidly
i
am
not
a
child
to
be
frightened
into
making
any
absurd
statements
i
do
draw
a
salary
of
thousand
a
year
no
i
am
in
business
for
myself
and
make
more
than
that
you
may
satisfy
yourself
by
examining
the
books
in
my
office
if
you
like
by
intimation
at
least
you
are
accusing
me
of
murder
now
answer
me
a
question
please
what
was
the
time
of
the
crime
chapter
xv
the
truth
in
part
the
chief
dropped
back
into
his
chair
with
the
utmost
complacency
this
was
not
the
kind
of
man
with
whom
mere
bluster
counted
haney
says
saturday
morning
he
answered
the
coroner
physician
agrees
with
that
yesterday
morning
wynne
mused
then
after
a
moment
i
think
chief
you
know
birnes
here
and
that
you
would
accept
a
statement
of
his
as
correct
yes
the
chief
agreed
with
a
glance
at
birnes
birnes
where
was
i
all
day
saturday
wynne
queried
without
so
much
as
looking
around
at
him
you
were
in
your
house
from
eleven
friday
night
until
fifteen
minutes
of
nine
saturday
morning
was
the
response
you
left
there
at
that
time
and
took
the
surface
car
at
street
to
your
office
you
left
your
office
at
five
minutes
of
one
took
luncheon
alone
at
the
savarin
and
returned
to
your
office
at
two
you
remained
there
until
five
or
a
few
minutes
past
then
returned
home
at
eight
you
is
that
sufficient
interrupted
wynne
does
that
constitute
an
alibi
yes
he
admitted
but
how
do
you
know
all
this
birnes
birnes
and
the
men
of
his
agency
have
favored
me
with
the
most
persistent
attentions
during
the
last
few
days
wynne
continued
promptly
he
has
had
two
men
constantly
on
watch
at
my
office
day
and
night
and
two
others
constantly
on
watch
at
my
home
day
and
night
there
are
two
there
now
one
in
a
rear
room
of
the
basement
and
another
in
the
pantry
with
the
doors
locked
on
the
outside
their
names
are
claflin
and
sutton
so
that
was
it
it
came
home
to
birnes
suddenly
claflin
and
sutton
had
been
tricked
into
the
house
on
some
pretext
and
locked
in
confound
their
stupidity
why
are
they
locked
up
demanded
the
chief
with
kindling
interest
why
have
you
been
watched
i
think
perhaps
birnes
will
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
crime
replied
wynne
easily
that
for
me
to
decide
declared
the
chief
bluntly
there
was
a
long
pause
czenki
was
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
gripping
the
arms
fiercely
with
his
lips
pressed
into
a
thin
line
it
was
only
by
a
supreme
effort
that
he
held
himself
in
control
and
the
lean
scarred
face
was
working
strangely
well
if
you
insist
on
knowing
observed
wynne
slowly
i
suppose
i
have
to
tell
all
of
it
in
the
first
place
it
came
finally
the
one
word
from
czenki
lips
a
smothered
explosion
which
drew
every
eye
upon
him
wynne
turned
slightly
in
his
chair
and
regarded
the
diamond
expert
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
on
his
face
the
beady
black
eyes
were
all
aglitter
with
the
effort
of
repression
and
some
intangible
message
flashed
in
them
in
the
first
place
resumed
wynne
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
kellner
here
do
the
expert
burst
out
again
desperately
do
it
means
ruin
absolute
ruin
kellner
had
those
diamonds
about
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
them
wynne
continued
distinctly
kellner
decided
to
sell
some
diamonds
one
of
the
quickest
and
most
satisfactory
methods
of
selling
rough
gems
such
as
those
you
have
in
your
hand
chief
is
to
offer
them
directly
to
the
men
who
deal
in
them
i
went
to
henry
latham
and
other
jewelers
of
new
york
on
behalf
of
kellner
and
offered
them
a
quantity
of
diamonds
it
may
be
that
they
regarded
the
quantity
i
offered
as
unusual
that
i
do
know
but
i
would
venture
the
conjecture
that
they
did
he
paused
a
moment
czenki
face
again
growing
expressionless
was
turned
toward
the
light
of
the
window
chief
arkwright
was
studying
it
shrewdly
diamond
merchants
of
course
have
to
be
careful
the
young
man
went
on
smoothly
they
ca
afford
to
buy
whatever
is
offered
by
people
whom
they
do
know
they
had
reason
too
to
believe
that
i
was
not
acting
for
myself
alone
what
was
more
natural
therefore
than
that
they
should
have
called
in
birnes
and
the
men
of
his
agency
to
find
out
about
me
and
if
possible
to
find
out
whom
i
represented
so
they
might
locate
the
supply
i
would
tell
them
because
it
was
not
desirable
that
they
should
deal
directly
with
kellner
who
was
old
and
childish
and
lacking
perhaps
in
appreciation
of
the
real
value
of
diamonds
the
result
of
all
this
was
that
the
diamond
dealers
placed
me
under
strict
surveillance
my
house
was
watched
my
office
was
watched
my
mail
going
and
coming
was
subjected
to
scrutiny
my
telephone
calls
were
traced
telegrams
opened
and
read
i
had
anticipated
all
this
of
course
and
was
in
communication
with
kellner
here
only
by
he
glanced
meaningly
at
birnes
who
was
utterly
absorbed
in
the
recital
those
were
not
exchanged
by
express
because
the
records
would
have
furnished
a
clew
to
birnes
men
i
personally
took
them
back
and
forth
in
a
suitcase
before
i
approached
latham
with
the
original
proposition
he
was
giving
categorical
answers
to
a
few
of
the
multitude
of
questions
to
which
birnes
had
been
seeking
answers
the
tense
expression
about
czenki
eyes
was
dissipated
and
he
sighed
a
little
i
saw
the
red
haney
affair
in
the
newspapers
this
morning
as
you
will
know
he
continued
after
a
moment
it
was
desirable
that
i
should
come
here
with
miss
kellner
but
it
was
not
desirable
even
under
those
circumstances
that
i
should
permit
myself
to
be
followed
that
how
it
happens
that
claflin
and
sutton
are
now
locked
up
in
my
house
again
there
was
a
pause
birnes
i
know
will
be
glad
to
confirm
my
statement
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
his
instructions
from
latham
and
the
other
gentlemen
interested
bear
on
it
chief
arkwright
glanced
at
the
detective
inquiringly
that
right
birnes
admitted
with
an
uncertain
nod
that
is
so
far
as
my
instructions
go
i
understood
though
that
the
diamonds
were
worth
more
than
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
fact
that
there
might
have
been
a
million
dollars
worth
of
them
a
million
dollars
repeated
chief
arkwright
in
amazement
a
million
dollars
he
repeated
he
turned
fiercely
upon
wynne
what
about
that
he
demanded
i
sure
i
do
know
what
birnes
replied
the
young
man
with
marked
emphasis
but
it
preposterous
on
the
face
of
it
is
it
would
a
man
with
a
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
live
in
a
hovel
like
this
the
chief
considered
the
matter
reflectively
for
a
minute
or
more
the
while
his
keen
eyes
alternately
searched
the
faces
of
wynne
and
czenki
it
would
depend
on
the
man
of
course
he
said
at
last
and
then
some
new
idea
was
born
within
him
your
direct
connection
with
the
crime
seems
to
be
disproved
wynne
he
remarked
slowly
and
if
we
admit
innocence
he
jerked
a
thumb
at
the
expert
there
remains
yet
another
do
you
see
it
the
young
man
turned
upon
him
quickly
does
it
occur
to
you
that
every
argument
i
advanced
to
furnish
you
with
a
motive
for
the
crime
might
be
applied
with
equal
weight
against
against
miss
kellner
doris
flamed
wynne
for
the
first
time
his
perfect
deserted
him
and
he
came
to
his
feet
with
gripping
hands
why
why
what
are
you
talking
about
sit
down
advised
the
chief
quietly
czenki
glanced
at
them
once
uneasily
then
resumed
his
fixed
stare
out
of
the
window
sit
down
said
the
chief
again
wynne
glared
at
him
for
an
instant
then
dropped
back
into
his
chair
his
hands
were
clenched
desperately
and
a
slight
flush
in
his
face
showed
the
fight
he
was
making
to
restrain
himself
all
the
property
this
old
man
owned
including
the
diamonds
would
become
her
property
in
the
event
of
his
death
or
murder
the
chief
added
mercilessly
that
true
is
it
but
when
she
entered
this
room
her
every
act
testified
to
her
innocence
wynne
burst
out
passionately
the
chief
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
has
been
living
at
a
little
hotel
in
irving
place
the
young
man
rushed
on
the
people
there
can
satisfy
you
as
to
her
whereabouts
on
saturday
again
the
chief
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
remember
please
that
the
best
answer
to
all
that
is
that
haney
had
the
diamonds
it
does
necessarily
follow
wynne
said
the
other
steadily
that
she
committed
the
crime
with
her
own
hands
it
comes
down
simply
to
this
if
there
were
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
then
the
one
motive
which
czenki
might
have
had
is
eliminated
because
haney
had
practically
fifty
thousand
worth
of
them
and
here
are
some
others
there
would
have
been
no
share
for
your
expert
here
and
again
if
there
were
only
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
the
diamonds
you
or
miss
kellner
would
have
been
the
only
persons
to
benefit
by
this
death
but
haney
had
those
protested
wynne
just
what
i
saying
agreed
the
other
complacently
therefore
there
more
than
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
however
we
look
at
it
whoever
may
have
been
haney
accomplice
that
point
seems
settled
or
else
haney
lied
declared
wynne
flatly
if
haney
came
here
alone
killed
this
old
man
and
stole
the
diamonds
there
would
be
none
of
these
questions
would
there
birnes
who
had
listened
silently
arose
suddenly
and
left
the
room
wynne
last
suggestion
awakened
a
new
train
of
thought
in
the
police
official
mind
and
he
considered
it
silently
for
a
moment
finally
he
shook
his
head
the
fact
remains
he
said
as
if
reassuring
himself
that
haney
described
an
accomplice
that
that
description
fits
czenki
perfectly
that
czenki
has
refused
to
defend
himself
or
even
make
a
denial
that
he
has
drawn
suspicion
upon
himself
by
everything
he
has
done
and
said
since
he
has
been
here
even
by
the
strange
manner
of
his
appearance
at
this
house
therefore
there
were
more
diamonds
and
he
got
his
share
of
them
hello
came
in
birnes
voice
from
the
hall
give
me
river
new
york
yes
is
latham
there
yes
henry
latham
again
wynne
forsook
him
and
he
came
to
his
feet
evidently
with
the
intention
of
interrupting
that
conversation
he
started
forward
with
gritting
teeth
and
simultaneously
chief
arkwright
connelly
and
czenki
laid
restraining
hands
upon
him
something
in
the
expert
grip
on
his
wrist
caused
him
to
stop
and
cease
a
futile
struggle
then
came
a
singular
expression
of
resignation
about
the
mouth
and
he
sat
down
again
hello
this
latham
this
is
detective
birnes
i
been
able
to
locate
some
diamonds
but
it
necessary
to
know
something
of
the
quantity
of
those
you
mentioned
you
remember
schultze
said
something
about
yes
yes
oh
there
unexpected
developments
yes
i
call
and
see
you
about
eight
yes
birnes
reentered
the
room
his
face
aglow
with
triumph
wynne
glanced
almost
hopelessly
at
czenki
then
turned
again
to
the
detective
i
should
say
there
more
than
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
them
birnes
blurted
there
were
at
least
a
million
worth
schultze
intimated
as
much
to
me
now
latham
confirms
it
chief
arkwright
turned
and
glared
scowlingly
upon
the
diamond
expert
the
beady
black
eyes
were
alight
with
some
emotion
which
he
failed
to
read
where
are
they
czenki
demanded
the
chief
harshly
i
have
nothing
to
say
replied
czenki
softly
so
your
disappearance
friday
night
and
your
absence
all
day
yesterday
did
have
to
do
with
this
old
man
death
said
the
chief
directly
accusing
him
i
have
nothing
to
say
murmured
czenki
that
settles
it
gentlemen
declared
the
chief
with
an
air
of
finality
czenki
i
charge
you
with
the
murder
of
kellner
here
anything
you
may
say
will
be
used
against
you
come
along
now
do
make
any
trouble
chapter
xvi
czenki
explains
fairly
drunk
with
excitement
his
lean
face
usually
expressionless
now
flushed
and
working
strangely
and
his
beady
black
eyes
aglitter
czenki
reeled
into
the
study
where
latham
and
schultze
sat
awaiting
birnes
he
raised
one
hand
enjoining
silence
closed
the
door
locked
it
and
placed
the
key
in
his
pocket
after
which
he
turned
upon
latham
he
them
man
he
them
he
burst
out
between
gritting
teeth
do
you
understand
makes
them
latham
astonished
and
a
little
startled
came
to
his
feet
the
phlegmatic
german
sat
still
staring
at
the
expert
without
comprehension
czenki
thin
fist
was
clenched
under
his
employer
nose
and
the
jeweler
drew
back
a
little
vaguely
alarmed
i
do
understand
what
he
began
the
diamonds
czenki
interrupted
and
the
long
excitement
within
him
burst
into
a
flame
of
impatience
the
diamonds
he
makes
them
do
you
see
diamonds
he
them
in
himmel
exclaimed
schultze
and
it
was
anything
but
an
irreverent
ejaculation
he
arose
der
miracle
has
come
to
pass
ve
might
haf
known
ve
might
haf
known
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
them
even
for
all
we
know
the
expert
rushed
on
in
incoherent
violence
a
sum
greater
than
all
the
combined
wealth
of
the
world
in
the
hands
of
one
man
think
of
it
latham
only
gazed
at
him
blankly
and
he
turned
instinctively
to
the
one
who
understood
schultze
think
of
the
mind
that
achieved
it
man
he
collapsed
into
a
chair
and
sat
looking
at
the
floor
his
fingers
writhing
within
one
another
muttering
to
himself
latham
was
a
cold
sane
unimaginative
man
of
business
as
yet
the
full
import
of
it
all
had
reached
him
he
stared
dumbly
first
at
czenki
then
at
schultze
there
was
not
even
incredulity
in
the
look
only
faint
amazement
that
two
such
men
should
have
gone
mad
at
once
at
last
the
german
importer
turned
upon
him
flatly
why
don
you
ged
egzited

he
demanded
he
iss
all
righd
nod
crazy
he
added
with
whimsical
assurance
he

he
ran
off
into
guttural
german
expletives
and
slowly
slowly
the
idea
began
to
dawn
upon
latham
the
diamonds
wynne
had
shown
were
not
real
then
they
were
artificial
it
was
some
sort
of
a
swindle
of
course
but
the
experts
had
agreed
that
they
were
diamonds
real
diamonds
perhaps
they
had
been
deceived
or
by
george
did
these
two
men
mean
to
say
that
they
were
real
diamonds
but
that
they
were
latham
tidy
little
imagination
balked
at
that
absurd
whoever
heard
of
a
diamond
as
big
as
the
or
the
regent
or
the
orloff
being
made
they
were
crazy
the
pair
of
them
do
i
understand
he
demanded
in
a
tone
of
deliberate
annoyance
that
you
czenki
and
you
schultze
expect
me
to
believe
that
those
diamonds
we
saw
were
not
natural
but
real
diamonds
turned
out
by
machinery
in
a
in
a
diamond
factory
is
that
what
you
are
driving
at

declared
the
german
bluntly

czenki
repeated
monotonously
yes
it
had
to
come
but
but
imagine
the
insuperable
difficulties
that
one
brain
had
to
surmount
he
passed
a
thin
hand
across
his
flushed
brow
and
was
thoughtfully
silent
i
do
believe
it
asserted
latham
tartly
it
impossible
i
do
believe
it
and
sat
down
id

latham
turned
away
from
him
half
angrily
and
glared
at
the
expert
who
was
still
regarding
the
floor
what
do
you
know
about
this
anyway
czenki
he
demanded
how
do
you
he
makes
them
have
you
him
make
them
thus
directly
addressed
czenki
looked
up
and
the
living
flame
of
wonder
within
his
eyes
flickered
and
died
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
more
he
studied
the
unconcealed
skepticism
in
his
face
and
then
asked
slowly
do
you
know
what
diamonds
are
mr
latham
there
is
some
theory
that
they
are
pure
carbon
crystallized
they
are
that
declared
the
expert
impatiently
you
know
that
diamonds
have
been
made
oh
i
read
something
about
it
yes
but
what
i
every
knows
how
to
make
a
diamond
latham
if
pure
carbon
is
heated
to
approximately
five
thousand
degrees
fahrenheit
and
simultaneously
subjected
to
a
pressure
of
approximately
six
thousand
tons
to
the
square
inch
it
becomes
a
diamond
and
no
theory
about
that
that
a
fact
the
difficulty
has
always
been
to
apply
the
knowledge
we
have
in
a
commercially
practicable
way
in
other
words
to
isolate
a
carbon
that
is
absolutely
pure
and
invent
a
method
of
applying
the
heat
and
pressure
simultaneously
it
has
been
done
latham
has
been
done
do
you
understand
what
it
means
to
with
an
effort
he
repressed
the
returning
excitement
which
found
vent
in
a
rising
voice
and
quick
nervous
gestures
of
the
hands
after
a
moment
he
went
on
half
a
score
of
scientists
have
made
diamonds
minute
particles
no
larger
than
the
point
of
a
pin
professor
henri
moissan
of
paris
went
further
and
by
use
of
an
electric
furnace
produced
diamonds
as
large
as
a
pinhead
you
may
remember
that
when
i
first
met
wynne
he
inquired
if
i
had
not
done
some
special
work
for
professor
moissan
i
had
i
tested
the
diamonds
he
made
they
were
diamonds
i
dare
say
the
suggestion
wynne
conveyed
to
me
by
that
question
that
is
the
suggestion
of
manufactured
diamonds
had
been
carefully
planned
for
he
is
a
wonderful
young
man
wynne
a
wonderful
young
man
he
paused
a
moment
we
know
that
he
has
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
them
we
know
because
we
saw
them
and
who
can
tell
how
many
billions
more
there
are
the
one
man
holds
in
his
hand
the
power
to
overturn
the
money
values
of
the
earth
but
how
do
you
know
he
makes
them
demanded
latham
returning
to
the
main
question
he
suggested
it
by
his
question
czenki
went
on
that
suggestion
lingered
in
my
mind
when
the
detective
birnes
reported
that
wynne
was
an
importer
of
brown
sugar
i
was
on
the
point
of
advancing
a
theory
that
the
diamonds
were
manufactured
because
of
all
known
substances
burnt
brown
sugar
is
richest
in
carbon
but
you
latham
had
discredited
a
previous
suggestion
of
mine
and
i
i
well
i
did
suggest
it
instead
that
night
i
personally
began
an
investigation
to
see
what
disposition
was
made
of
the
sugar
i
found
that
the
ships
discharged
their
cargoes
in
hoboken
that
the
sugar
was
there
loaded
on
barges
and
those
barges
hauled
up
a
small
stream
to
the
little
town
of
coaldale
all
consigned
to
a
hugo
kellner
it
took
friday
all
day
saturday
and
a
great
part
of
to
learn
all
this
this
afternoon
i
went
to
see
kellner
i
found
him
murdered
he
stated
it
merely
as
an
inconvenient
incident
in
the
room
with
the
body
were
birnes
chief
arkwright
of
the
new
york
police
and
another
new
york
detective
i
had
glanced
at
the
story
of
red
haney
and
the
diamonds
in
the
morning
papers
and
from
what
i
knew
and
from
birnes
presence
i
surmised
something
of
the
truth
i
was
instantly
placed
under
arrest
for
murder
the
murder
of
this
man
i
had
never
seen
the
diamond
master
the
man
who
achieved
it
all
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
from
infinite
wynne
came
and
a
miss
kellner
granddaughter
of
the
dead
man
he
saw
me
and
understood
between
us
we
contrived
that
i
should
be
taken
away
as
the
murderer
and
so
prevent
an
immediate
search
of
the
house
i
made
no
denial
i
permitted
myself
to
be
taken
some
mistake
as
to
identity
i
proved
an
alibi
by
the
shipping
men
in
hoboken
the
diamonds
are
there
untold
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
them
the
diamond
master
is
dead
latham
had
been
listening
as
if
dazed
to
the
hurried
somewhat
disconnected
narrative
schultze
keener
to
comprehend
all
that
the
story
meant
was
silent
for
a
moment
den
if
all
dose
men
know
all
he
has
told
us
laadham
he
remarked
finally
our
diamonds
are
nod
worth
any
more
as
potatoes
but
they
know
czenki
burst
out
fiercely
do
you
understand
haney
or
somebody
killed
kellner
and
stole
some
uncut
diamonds
you
must
have
seen
the
newspaper
account
of
it
the
new
york
police
traced
haney
course
to
coaldale
and
to
that
house
but
all
know
is
that
sixty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
uncut
stones
were
stolen
there
was
not
even
a
suggestion
to
them
of
the
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
that
were
manufactured
do
you
understand
i
permitted
myself
to
be
accused
and
arrested
knowing
i
could
establish
an
alibi
in
order
to
lead
them
away
from
there
and
gain
time
at
least
to
give
wynne
an
opportunity
of
hiding
the
other
diamonds
if
they
were
there
he
understood
what
i
was
trying
to
do
and
fell
in
with
the
plan
he
knew
that
knew
the
diamonds
were
made
birnes
does
know
one
knows
but
you
and
me
and
wynne
and
perhaps
the

do
you

the
great
cube
a
cube
of
solid
polished
steel
some
twenty
feet
square
set
on
a
spreading
base
of
concrete
and
divided
perpendicularly
down
the
middle
into
titanic
halves
these
being
snugly
fitted
one
to
the
other
by
a
series
of
triangular
corrugations
a
variation
of
the
familiar
tongue
and
groove
interlacing
the
ponderous
mass
from
corner
to
corner
were
huge
steel
bolts
and
the
hulking
heads
of
more
bolts
some
forty
on
each
of
the
four
sides
showed
that
the
whole
might
be
split
into
halves
at
will
and
readily
made
whole
again
one
enormous
side
sliding
back
and
forth
on
a
short
track
in
the
two
undivided
faces
of
the
cube
relatively
squaring
the
center
were
four
borings
somewhat
smaller
in
diameter
than
an
ordinary
pencil
and
extending
through
and
directly
in
the
center
was
focused
a
network
of
insulated
wires
which
dropped
down
out
of
the
gloom
overhead
in
the
other
two
sides
of
the
great
cube
just
where
the
dividing
lines
of
the
halves
came
were
the
mouths
of
a
boring
this
too
extended
straight
through
directly
opposite
each
of
the
two
mouths
a
dozen
feet
away
was
mounted
a
heavy
gun
of
the
naval
type
in
a
general
sort
of
way
these
were
not
unlike
ordnance
but
the
breech
was
much
larger
in
proportion
the
barrel
longer
and
the
bore
only
two
instead
of
twelve
inches
the
mountings
were
high
and
the
adjustment
so
delicate
that
looking
into
the
open
breech
of
one
gun
the
bore
through
the
cube
and
through
the
barrel
of
the
gun
on
the
other
side
seemed
to
be
continuous
this
is
the
machine
gentlemen
said
wynne
and
he
indicated
to
latham
schultze
and
czenki
the
cube
and
the
two
guns
it
is
perfectly
simple
in
construction
has
enormous
powers
of
resistance
as
you
may
guess
and
is
as
delicately
fitted
as
a
watch
being
regulated
by
electric
power
this
cube
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
was
only
one
of
the
many
seemingly
insuperable
obstacles
to
be
overcome
when
the
bolts
are
withdrawn
one
half
slides
back
when
the
bolts
are
in
position
it
is
as
solid
as
if
it
were
in
one
piece
and
perfectly
able
to
withstand
a
force
greater
than
the
ingenuity
of
man
has
ever
before
been
able
to
contrive
this
force
is
a
combination
of
a
heat
that
of
the
sun
on
its
surface
and
a
impact
of
two
projectiles
fired
less
than
forty
feet
apart
with
an
enormous
charge
of
cordite
and
possessing
an
initial
velocity
greater
than
was
ever
recorded
in
gunnery
this
vast
force
centers
in
a
sort
of
furnace
in
the
middle
of
the
cube
the
furnace
is
round
about
three
feet
long
and
three
feet
in
diameter
built
of
half
a
dozen
substances
in
layers
perforated
for
electric
wires
with
an
opening
through
it
lengthwise
of
the
exact
size
of
the
borings
in
the
guns
and
in
the
cube
it
fits
snugly
into
a
receptacle
cut
out
for
it
in
the
center
of
the
cube
and
is
intended
to
protect
the
steel
of
the
cube
proper
from
the
intense
heat
this
heat
reaches
the
furnace
by
electric
wires
which
enter
the
cube
from
the
sides
as
you
see
being
brought
here
by
a
conduit
along
the
from
a
large
five
miles
away
large
wires
are
necessary
to
bring
it
i
own
the
ostensibly
for
the
operation
of
a
small
sugar
refinery
i
may
add
that
the
furnace
is
a
variation
of
the
principle
employed
by
professor
moissan
in
paris
he
turned
to
czenki
you
may
remember
having
heard
me
mention
him
i
remember
the
expert
acquiesced
grimly
now
pure
carbon
is
vaporized
as
you
perhaps
know
at
a
fraction
less
than
five
thousand
degrees
fahrenheit
wynne
continued
a
carbon
not
merely
chemically
pure
but
pure
in
highly
compressed
disks
is
packed
in
the
furnace
the
furnace
placed
within
the
cube
the
ends
of
the
opening
in
the
furnace
being
blocked
to
prevent
expansion
the
cube
closed
the
bolts
fastened
and
heat
applied
for
several
minutes
a
heat
gentlemen
of
five
thousand
two
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
fahrenheit
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
only
about
ten
thousand
degrees
and
then
the
pressure
of
about
seven
thousand
tons
to
the
square
inch
is
added
by
means
of
the
two
guns
in
other
words
gentlemen
pure
carbon
vaporized
is
caught
between
two
projectiles
which
enter
the
cube
simultaneously
from
opposite
sides
being
fired
by
electricity
the
impact
is
so
terrific
that
what
had
been
two
feet
of
compressed
carbon
is
instantly
condensed
into
an
irregular
disk
one
inch
or
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
that
disk
gentlemen
is
a
diamond
the
violence
of
the
operation
coupled
with
the
intense
heat
fuses
everything
furnace
projectiles
electric
wires
even
asbestos
into
a
single
mass
the
cube
is
opened
and
this
mass
is
dropped
into
cold
water
this
increases
the
pressure
until
the
mass
is
cool
then
it
is
broken
away
and
in
the
center
is
a
diamond
as
big
as
a
biscuit
gentlemen
four
small
bores
lead
from
the
bore
through
the
cube
and
permit
the
escape
of
air
as
the
projectiles
enter
there
is
no
rebound
because
the
elastic
quality
of
the
carbon
is
crushed
out
of
existence
driven
i
may
say
into
the
diamond
itself
of
course
the
furnace
the
two
projectiles
and
the
connecting
electric
wires
are
all
destroyed
at
each
charge
which
brings
the
total
cost
of
the
operation
to
a
little
more
than
eight
hundred
dollars
including
nearly
three
tons
of
brown
sugar
the
diamond
resulting
is
worth
at
least
a
million
when
broken
up
for
cutting
sometimes
even
two
millions
that
is
all
i
think
there
was
a
long
awed
silence
latham
leaning
against
the
giant
cube
stared
thoughtfully
at
his
toes
schultze
was
peering
curiously
about
him
thence
off
into
the
gloom
czenki
still
had
a
question
i
understand
that
all
the
diamonds
were
made
in
that
shape
he
remarked
at
last
then
the
uncut
stones
that
were
stolen
were
they
were
natural
stones
interrupted
wynne
imported
for
purposes
of
study
and
experiment
i
told
chief
arkwright
the
truth
but
not
all
of
it
in
the
last
twenty
years
kellner
had
destroyed
some
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
in
this
way
i
may
add
that
while
kellner
had
succeeded
in
making
diamonds
of
large
size
he
had
never
made
a
perfect
one
until
eight
years
ago
but
meanwhile
the
expenses
of
the
work
as
you
will
understand
were
enormous
so
during
the
past
eight
years
about
a
million
dollars
worth
of
diamonds
have
been
sold
one
or
two
at
a
time
to
meet
this
expense
he
paused
a
moment
then
resumed
musingly
all
this
you
understand
is
not
the
work
of
a
day
kellner
was
nearly
years
old
and
it
was
years
ago
that
he
began
work
here
the
cubes
there
were
made
and
placed
in
position
thirty
years
ago
the
guns
have
been
there
for
years
so
long
in
fact
that
recollection
of
them
has
passed
from
the
minds
of
the
men
who
made
them
and
until
four
years
ago
he
was
assisted
by
his
son
miss
kellner
father
and
her
brother
there
was
some
explosion
in
this
chamber
where
we
stand
which
killed
them
both
and
since
then
he
has
worked
alone
his
son
miss
kellner
father
was
the
inventor
of
the
machine
which
has
enabled
us
to
cut
all
the
stones
i
showed
you
i
mailed
the
application
for
patent
on
this
machine
to
washington
three
days
ago
it
is
as
intricate
as
a
linotype
and
delicate
as
a
chronometer
but
it
does
the
work
of
fifty
expert
until
patent
papers
are
granted
i
must
ask
that
i
be
allowed
to
protect
that
latham
turned
upon
him
quickly
but
you
explained
all
this
to
us
fully
he
exclaimed
sharply
indicating
the
cube
and
the
guns
we
duplicate
that
if
we
liked
yes
you
could
latham
replied
wynne
slowly
but
you
ca
duplicate
the
brain
that
isolated
absolutely
pure
carbon
from
the
charred
residue
of
brown
sugar
that
brain
was
kellner
the
secret
died
with
him
again
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
at
last
by
schultze
dat
means
no
more
diamonds
can
be
made
undil
some
one
else
can
make
der
pure
carbon
ain
id
yah
und
dat
brings
us
down
to
der
question
how
many
diamonds
are
made
alretty
the
diamonds
i
showed
you
gentlemen
were
all
that
have
been
cut
thus
far
replied
wynne
less
than
twenty
of
the
disks
were
used
in
making
them
there
are
now
some
five
hundred
more
of
these
disks
in
existence
roughly
a
billion
dollars
worth
so
you
see
i
am
prepared
to
hold
you
to
my
proposition
that
you
buy
one
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
them
at
the
carat
price
you
now
pay
in
the
open
market
latham
passed
one
hand
across
a
brow
bedewed
with
perspiration
and
stared
helplessly
at
the
german
the
work
of
cutting
could
go
on
steadily
here
under
the
direction
of
czenki
wynne
resumed
after
a
moment
the
secrecy
of
this
place
has
not
been
violated
for
forty
years
we
are
now
one
hundred
and
seventy
feet
below
ground
level
in
a
gallery
of
the
abandoned
coal
mine
which
gave
coaldale
its
name
reached
underground
from
the
cellar
in
the
cottage
roofs
and
walls
of
the
entire
place
are
shored
up
to
insure
safety
and
heavy
felts
make
this
chamber
smothering
even
the
detonation
of
the
guns
czenki
is
the
man
to
do
the
work
kellner
for
ten
years
held
him
to
be
the
first
expert
in
the
world
and
it
would
be
carrying
out
his
wishes
if
czenki
would
agree
if
does
not
shall
undertake
it
flood
the
market
his
voice
hardened
a
little
and
gentlemen
call
off
your
detectives
the
secret
is
now
more
yours
than
mine
it
destroys
if
it
becomes
known
not
the
new

police
have
turned

end
of
