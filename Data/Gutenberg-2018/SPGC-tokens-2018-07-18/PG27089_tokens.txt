men
who
did
dangerous
work
had
a
special
kind
of
insurance
policy
but
when
somebody
wanted
to
collect
on
that
policy
the
claims
investigator
suddenly
became
a
member
of
the
risk
profession
by
donald
westlake
mister
henderson
called
me
into
his
office
my
third
day
back
in
tangiers
that
was
a
day
and
a
half
later
than
i
expected
roving
claims
investigators
for
tangiers
mutual
insurance
corporation
usually
get
to
spend
more
than
consecutive
hours
at
home
base
henderson
was
jovial
but
stern
that
meant
he
was
happy
with
the
job
just
completed
and
that
he
was
pretty
sure
i
find
some
crooked
shenanigans
on
this
next
assignment
that
did
please
me
basically
a
type
and
i
hate
complications
i
almost
wished
for
a
second
there
that
i
was
back
on
fire
and
theft
in
greater
new
york
but
i
knew
better
than
that
as
a
roving
claim
investigator
i
avoided
the
more
stultifying
paper
work
inherent
in
this
line
of
work
and
had
the
additional
luxury
of
an
expense
account
nobody
ever
questioned
it
made
working
for
a
living
almost
worthwhile
when
i
was
settled
in
the
chair
beside
his
desk
henderson
said
that
was
good
work
you
did
on
luna
ged
saved
the
company
a
pretty
pence
i
smiled
modestly
and
said
thank
you
sir
and
reflected
to
myself
for
the
thousandth
time
that
the
company
could
do
worse
than
split
that
saving
with
the
guy
who
made
it
possible
me
in
other
words
got
a
tricky
one
this
time
ged
said
my
boss
he
had
done
his
now
we
got
down
to
business
he
peered
keenly
at
me
or
at
least
as
keenly
as
a
fat
man
peer
what
do
you
know
about
the
risk
profession
retirement
plan
he
asked
me
i
heard
of
it
i
said
truthfully
that
about
all
he
nodded
most
of
the
policies
are
sold
of
course
it
a
form
of
insurance
for
spaceship
crews
asteroid
prospectors
people
like
that
i
see
i
said
unhappily
i
knew
right
away
this
meant
i
was
going
to
have
to
go
again
i
a
boy
all
the
way
gravity
changes
get
me
in
the
solar
plexus
i
get
at
the
drop
of
an
elevator
here
the
way
it
works
he
went
on
either
not
noticing
my
sad
face
or
choosing
to
ignore
it
the
client
pays
a
monthly
premium
he
can
be
as
far
ahead
or
as
far
behind
in
his
payments
as
he
wants
the
policy
has
no
lapse
clause
just
so
he
all
paid
up
by
the
target
date
the
target
date
is
a
retirement
age
or
above
chosen
by
the
client
himself
after
the
target
date
he
stops
paying
premiums
and
we
begin
to
pay
him
a
monthly
retirement
check
the
amount
determined
by
the
amount
paid
into
the
policy
his
age
at
retiring
and
so
on
clear
i
nodded
looking
for
the
gimmick
that
made
this
a
paying
proposition
for
good
old
tangiers
mutual
the
double
that
what
we
call
it
around
the
office
here
assures
the
client
that
he
wo
be
reduced
to
panhandling
in
his
old
age
should
his
other
retirement
plans
fall
through
for
belt
prospectors
of
course
this
means
the
big
strike
which
maybe
one
in
a
hundred
find
for
the
man
who
never
does
make
that
big
strike
this
is
something
to
fall
back
on
he
can
come
home
to
earth
and
retire
with
a
guaranteed
income
for
the
rest
of
his
life
i
nodded
again
like
a
good
company
man
of
course
said
henderson
emphasizing
this
point
with
an
upraised
chubby
finger
these
men
are
still
uninsurables
this
is
a
retirement
plan
only
not
an
insurance
policy
there
is
no
beneficiary
other
than
the
client
himself
and
there
was
the
gimmick
i
knew
a
little
something
of
the
actuarial
statistics
concerning
uninsurables
particularly
belt
prospectors
not
many
of
them
lived
to
be
and
the
few
who
would
survive
the
belt
and
come
home
to
collect
the
retirement
would
last
more
than
a
year
or
two
a
man
who
spent
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
on
asteroids
just
shrivels
up
after
a
while
when
he
tries
to
live
on
earth
it
needed
a
company
like
tangiers
mutual
to
dream
up
a
racket
like
that
the
term
uninsurables
to
most
insurance
companies
means
those
people
whose
jobs
or
habitats
make
them
too
likely
as
prospects
for
obituaries
to
tangiers
mutual
uninsurables
are
people
who
have
money
the
company
ca
get
at
now
said
henderson
importantly
we
come
to
the
problem
at
hand
he
ruffled
his
in
basket
and
finally
found
the
folder
he
wanted
he
studied
the
blank
exterior
of
this
folder
for
a
few
seconds
pursing
his
lips
at
it
and
said
one
of
our
clients
under
the
double
was
a
man
named
jafe
mccann
was
i
echoed
he
squinted
at
me
then
nodded
at
my
sharpness
that
right
dead
he
sighed
heavily
and
tapped
the
folder
with
all
those
pudgy
fingers
normally
he
said
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
file
closed
however
this
time
there
are
complications
naturally
otherwise
he
would
be
telling
about
it
but
henderson
could
be
rushed
and
i
knew
it
i
kept
the
alert
look
on
my
face
and
thought
of
other
things
while
waiting
for
him
to
get
to
the
point
two
weeks
after
jafe
mccann
death
henderson
said
we
received
a
form
on
his
policy
a
form
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
it
did
sound
like
anything
tangiers
mutual
would
have
anything
to
do
with
we
return
cash
it
something
special
in
this
case
he
explained
you
see
this
is
an
insurance
policy
it
a
retirement
plan
and
the
client
can
withdraw
from
the
retirement
plan
at
any
time
and
have
per
cent
of
his
premiums
returned
to
him
it
uh
the
law
in
plans
such
as
this
oh
i
said
that
explained
it
a
law
that
had
snuck
through
the
world
finance
code
commission
while
the
insurance
lobby
was
looking
but
you
see
the
point
said
henderson
this
form
arrived
two
weeks
after
the
client
death
you
said
there
were
any
beneficiaries
i
pointed
out
of
course
but
the
form
was
sent
in
by
the
man
partner
one
ab
karpin
mccann
left
a
will
bequeathing
all
his
possessions
to
karpin
since
according
to
karpin
this
was
done
before
death
the
premium
money
can
not
be
considered
part
of
the
policy
but
as
part
of
mccann
and
karpin
wants
it
it
ca
be
that
much
can
it
i
asked
i
was
trying
my
best
to
point
out
to
him
that
the
company
would
spend
more
than
it
would
save
if
it
sent
me
all
the
way
out
to
the
asteroids
a
prospect
i
could
feel
coming
and
one
which
i
was
ready
to
cry
hosannah
over
mccann
died
henderson
said
ponderously
at
the
age
of
he
had
set
his
retirement
age
at
sixty
he
took
out
the
policy
at
the
age
of
with
monthly
payments
of
fifty
credits
figure
it
out
for
yourself
i
did
in
my
head
and
came
up
with
a
figure
of
thirteen
thousand
and
two
hundred
credits
per
cent
of
that
would
be
nine
thousand
and
nine
hundred
credits
call
it
ten
thousand
credits
even
i
had
to
admit
it
it
was
worth
the
trip
i
see
i
said
sadly
now
said
henderson
the
conditions
the
circumstances
of
death
are
somewhat
suspicious
and
so
is
the
form
itself
there
a
chance
it
a
forgery
one
would
think
so
he
said
but
our
handwriting
experts
have
worn
themselves
out
with
that
form
comparing
it
with
every
other
single
scrap
of
mccann
writing
they
can
find
and
their
conclusion
is
that
not
only
is
it
genuinely
mccann
handwriting
but
it
is
handwriting
at
age
so
mccann
must
have
written
it
i
said
under
duress
do
you
think
i
have
no
idea
said
henderson
complacently
that
what
supposed
to
find
out
oh
there
just
one
more
thing
i
did
my
best
to
make
my
ears
perk
i
told
you
that
mccann
death
occurred
under
somewhat
suspicious
circumstances
yes
i
agreed
you
did
mccann
and
karpin
he
said
have
been
partners
unincorporated
of
course
for
the
last
fifteen
years
they
had
found
small
deposits
now
and
again
but
they
had
never
found
that
one
big
strike
all
the
belt
prospectors
waste
their
lives
looking
for
not
until
the
day
before
mccann
died
ah
hah
i
said
they
found
the
big
strike
exactly
and
mccann
death
accidental
sure
i
said
what
proof
have
we
got
none
the
body
is
lost
in
space
and
law
is
few
and
far
between
that
far
out
so
all
we
got
is
this
guy
karpin
word
for
how
mccann
died
is
that
it
that
all
we
have
so
far
sure
and
now
you
want
me
to
go
on
out
there
and
find
out
cooking
and
see
if
i
can
maybe
save
the
company
ten
thousand
credits
exactly
said
henderson
the
copter
took
me
to
the
spaceport
west
of
cairo
and
there
i
boarded
the
good
ship
for
luna
city
and
points
out
i
loaded
up
on
pills
and
they
worked
fine
i
was
sick
as
a
dog
by
the
time
we
got
to
atronics
city
my
insides
had
grown
resigned
to
their
fate
as
long
as
i
did
try
to
eat
my
stomach
would
leave
me
alone
atronics
city
was
about
as
depressing
as
a
turkish
bath
with
all
the
lights
on
it
stood
on
a
chunk
of
rock
a
couple
of
miles
thick
and
it
looked
like
nothing
more
in
this
world
than
a
welder
practice
range
from
the
outside
atronics
city
is
just
a
dome
of
black
and
kind
of
i
suppose
a
transparent
dome
would
have
been
more
fun
but
the
builders
of
the
company
cities
in
the
asteroids
were
businessmen
and
they
were
concerned
with
having
fun
there
nothing
to
look
at
outside
the
dome
but
chunks
of
rock
and
the
blackness
of
space
anyway
and
you
got
all
this
cheap
iron
floating
around
in
the
vicinity
and
all
a
dome
supposed
to
do
is
keep
the
air
in
besides
though
the
belt
is
as
crowded
as
a
lot
of
people
think
there
quite
a
lot
of
debris
rushing
here
and
there
bumping
into
things
and
a
transparent
dome
would
just
get
all
scratched
up
not
to
mention
punctured
from
the
inside
atronics
city
is
even
jollier
there
the
top
level
directly
under
the
dome
which
is
mainly
parking
area
for
scooters
and
tuggers
of
various
kinds
plus
the
office
shacks
of
the
office
the
entry
authority
the
industry
troopers
and
so
on
the
next
three
levels
have
all
been
burned
into
the
bowels
of
the
planetoid
level
two
is
the
atronics
plant
and
a
noisy
plant
it
is
level
three
is
the
shopping
and
entertainment
area
grocery
stores
and
clothing
stores
and
movie
theaters
and
bars
and
level
four
is
housing
two
rooms
and
kitchen
for
the
unmarried
four
rooms
and
kitchen
plus
one
room
for
each
child
for
the
married
all
of
these
levels
have
one
thing
in
common
square
corners
painted
olive
drab
the
total
effect
of
the
place
is
suffocating
you
feel
like
you
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
stack
of
packing
crates
most
of
the
people
living
in
atronics
city
work
of
course
for
international
atronics
incorporated
the
rest
of
them
work
in
the
service
occupations
running
the
bars
and
grocery
stores
and
so
on
that
keep
the
company
employees
alive
and
relatively
happy
wages
come
high
in
the
places
like
atronics
city
why
not
the
raw
materials
come
practically
for
free
and
as
for
working
conditions
well
take
a
for
instance
how
do
you
make
a
vacuum
tube
you
fiddle
with
the
innards
and
surround
it
all
with
glass
and
how
do
you
get
the
air
out
no
problem
boy
there
was
any
air
in
there
to
begin
with
at
any
rate
there
i
was
at
atronics
city
that
was
as
far
as
would
take
me
now
while
the
ship
went
on
to
ludlum
city
and
chemisant
city
and
the
other
asteroid
business
towns
my
two
suitcases
and
i
dribbled
down
the
elevator
to
my
hostelry
on
level
four
have
you
ever
taken
an
elevator
ride
when
the
gravity
is
practically
well
do
you
see
the
elevator
manages
to
sink
faster
than
you
do
it
is
being
down
to
level
four
it
being
down
what
this
means
is
that
the
suitcases
have
to
be
lashed
down
with
the
straps
provided
and
you
and
the
operator
have
to
hold
on
tight
to
the
placed
here
and
there
around
the
wall
otherwise
you
clonk
your
head
on
the
ceiling
but
we
got
to
level
four
at
last
and
off
i
went
with
my
suitcases
and
the
operator
directions
the
suitcases
weighed
about
half
an
ounce
each
out
here
and
i
felt
as
though
i
weighed
the
same
every
time
i
raised
a
foot
i
was
sure
i
was
about
to
go
sailing
into
a
wall
local
citizens
eased
by
me
their
feet
occasionally
touching
the
iron
pavement
as
they
soared
along
and
i
gave
them
all
dirty
looks
level
four
was
nothing
but
walls
and
windows
the
iron
floor
went
among
these
walls
and
windows
in
a
straight
straight
line
bisecting
other
streets
at
perfect
right
angles
and
the
iron
ceiling
sixteen
feet
up
was
lined
with
a
double
row
of
fluorescent
tubes
i
was
beginning
to
feel
claustrophobic
already
the
chalmers
hotel
named
for
an
atronics
had
received
my
advance
registration
which
was
nice
i
was
shown
to
a
room
nothing
on
level
four
had
more
than
two
stories
and
was
left
to
unpack
my
suitcases
as
best
i
may
i
had
decided
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
atronics
city
before
taking
a
scooter
out
to
ab
karpin
claim
atronics
city
had
been
karpin
and
mccann
home
base
all
of
mccann
premium
payments
had
been
mailed
from
here
and
the
normal
mailing
address
for
both
of
them
was
gpo
atronics
city
i
wanted
to
know
as
much
as
possible
about
ab
karpin
before
i
went
out
to
see
him
and
atronics
city
seemed
like
the
best
place
to
get
my
information
but
not
today
today
my
stomach
was
very
unhappy
and
my
head
was
on
sympathy
strike
today
i
was
going
to
spend
my
time
exclusively
in
bed
trying
not
to
float
up
to
the
ceiling
the
mapping
registry
office
it
seemed
to
me
the
next
day
was
the
best
place
to
start
this
was
where
prospectors
filed
their
claims
but
it
was
a
lot
more
than
that
the
waiting
room
of
m
r
was
the
unofficial
club
of
the
asteroid
prospectors
this
is
where
they
met
with
one
another
talked
together
about
the
things
that
prospectors
discuss
and
made
and
dissolved
their
transient
partnerships
in
this
way
karpin
and
mccann
were
unusual
they
had
maintained
their
partnership
for
fifteen
years
that
was
about
sixty
times
longer
than
most
such
arrangements
lasted
searching
the
asteroid
chunks
for
rare
and
valuable
metals
is
basically
pretty
lonely
work
and
it
inevitable
that
the
prospectors
will
every
once
in
a
while
get
hungry
for
human
company
and
decide
to
try
a
team
operation
but
at
the
same
time
work
like
this
attracts
people
who
do
get
along
very
well
with
human
company
so
the
partnerships
come
and
go
and
the
hatreds
flare
and
are
forgotten
and
the
normal
prospecting
team
lasts
an
average
of
three
months
at
any
rate
it
was
to
the
mapping
registry
office
that
i
went
first
and
since
that
office
was
up
on
the
first
level
i
went
by
elevator
riding
in
that
elevator
was
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
fun
than
riding
down
the
elevator
whipped
up
like
mad
the
floor
pressed
against
the
soles
of
my
feet
and
it
felt
almost
like
good
old
earth
for
a
second
or
two
there
but
then
the
elevator
stopped
and
i
held
on
tight
to
the
to
keep
from
shooting
through
the
top
of
the
blasted
thing
the
operator
a
phlegmatic
sort
gave
me
directions
to
the
m
r
and
off
i
went
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
sail
along
as
gracefully
as
the
locals
the
mapping
registry
office
occupied
a
shack
over
near
the
dome
wall
next
to
the
entry
lock
i
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
on
in
the
waiting
room
was
cozy
and
surprisingly
large
large
enough
to
comfortably
hold
the
six
maroon
leather
sofas
scattered
here
and
there
on
the
pale
green
carpet
flanked
by
bronze
ashtray
stands
there
were
only
six
prospectors
here
at
the
moment
chatting
together
in
two
groups
of
three
and
they
all
looked
alike
grizzled
ageless
their
clothing
clean
but
baggy
i
passed
them
and
went
on
to
the
desk
at
the
far
end
behind
which
sat
a
young
man
in
official
gray
slowly
turning
the
crank
of
a
microfilm
reader
he
looked
up
at
my
approach
i
flashed
my
company
identification
and
asked
to
speak
to
the
manager
he
went
away
came
back
and
ushered
me
into
an
office
which
managed
to
be
spartan
and
sumptuous
at
the
same
time
the
walls
had
been
in
textured
brown
the
iron
floor
had
been
lushly
carpeted
in
gray
and
the
desk
had
been
covered
with
a
simulated
wood
coating
the
manager
a
man
named
teaking
went
well
with
the
office
his
face
and
hands
were
spare
and
lean
but
his
uniform
was
immaculate
covered
with
every
curlicue
the
regulations
allowed
he
welcomed
me
politely
but
curiously
and
i
said
i
wonder
if
you
know
a
prospector
named
ab
karpin
karpin
of
course
he
and
old
jafe
mccann
pity
about
mccann
i
hear
he
got
killed
yes
he
did
and
that
what
you
here
for
eh
he
nodded
sagely
i
did
know
the
belt
boys
could
get
insurance
he
said
it
is
exactly
that
i
said
this
concerns
a
retirement
plan
and
well
the
details
do
matter
which
i
hoped
would
end
his
curiosity
in
that
line
i
was
hoping
you
could
give
me
some
background
on
karpin
and
on
mccann
too
for
that
matter
he
grinned
a
bit
you
saw
the
men
sitting
outside
i
nodded
then
you
seen
karpin
and
mccann
exactly
the
same
it
does
matter
if
a
man
thirty
or
sixty
or
what
it
does
matter
what
he
was
like
before
he
came
out
here
if
he
been
here
a
few
years
he
looks
exactly
like
the
bunch
you
saw
outside
there
that
appearance
i
said
what
i
was
looking
for
was
personality
same
thing
he
said
all
of
them
fiercely
independent
incurably
romantic
always
convinced
that
the
big
strike
is
just
a
piece
of
rock
away
mccann
now
he
was
a
bit
more
realistic
than
most
he
be
the
one
i
expect
to
take
out
a
retirement
policy
a
real
that
one
though
i
should
say
it
as
he
dead
but
that
the
way
he
was
brighter
than
most
belt
boys
when
it
came
to
money
matters
i
seen
him
haggle
over
a
new
piece
of
equipment
for
their
scooter
or
some
repair
work
or
some
such
thing
and
he
was
a
wonder
to
watch
and
karpin
i
asked
him
a
prospector
he
said
as
though
that
answered
my
question
same
as
everybody
else
not
as
sharp
as
mccann
when
it
came
to
money
that
why
all
the
money
stuff
in
the
partnership
was
handled
by
mccann
but
karpin
was
one
of
the
sharpest
boys
in
the
business
when
it
came
to
mineralogy
he
knew
rocks
you
and
i
never
heard
of
and
most
times
he
knew
them
by
sight
almost
all
of
the
belt
boys
are
college
grads
you
got
to
know
what
you
looking
for
out
here
and
what
it
looks
like
when
found
it
but
karpin
has
practically
all
of
them
beat
he
sounds
like
a
good
team
i
said
i
guess
that
why
they
stayed
together
so
long
he
said
they
complemented
each
other
he
leaned
forward
the
inevitable
prelude
to
a
confidential
remark
i
tell
you
something
off
the
record
mister
he
said
those
two
were
smarter
than
they
knew
their
partnership
was
never
legalized
it
was
never
anything
more
than
a
piece
of
paper
and
there
a
bunch
of
fellas
around
here
mighty
unhappy
about
that
today
jafe
mccann
is
the
one
who
handled
all
the
money
matters
like
i
said
he
got
iou
all
over
town
and
they
ca
collect
from
karpin
he
nodded
jafe
mccann
died
just
a
bit
too
soon
he
was
sharp
and
cheap
but
he
was
honest
if
he
lived
he
would
have
repaid
all
his
debts
i
sure
of
it
and
if
this
strike
they
made
is
as
good
as
i
hear
he
would
have
been
able
to
repay
them
with
no
trouble
at
all
i
nodded
somewhat
impatiently
i
had
the
feeling
by
now
that
i
was
talking
to
a
man
who
was
one
of
those
who
had
a
jafe
mccann
iou
in
his
pocket
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
seen
karpin
i
asked
him
wondering
what
karpin
attitude
and
expression
was
now
that
his
partner
was
dead
oh
lord
not
for
a
couple
of
months
he
said
not
since
they
went
out
together
the
last
time
and
made
that
strike
did
karpin
come
in
to
make
his
claim
not
here
over
to
chemisant
city
that
was
the
nearest
m
r
to
the
strike
oh
that
was
a
pity
i
would
have
liked
to
have
known
if
there
had
been
a
change
of
any
kind
in
karpin
since
his
partner
death
tell
you
what
the
situation
is
i
said
with
a
false
air
of
truthfulness
we
have
some
misgivings
about
mccann
death
not
suspicions
exactly
just
misgivings
the
timing
is
what
bothers
us
you
mean
because
it
happened
just
after
the
strike
that
it
i
answered
frankly
he
shook
his
head
i
would
get
too
excited
about
that
if
i
were
you
he
said
it
would
be
the
first
time
it
happened
a
man
makes
the
big
strike
after
all
and
he
gets
so
excited
he
forgets
himself
for
a
minute
and
gets
careless
and
you
only
have
to
be
careless
once
out
here
that
may
be
it
i
said
i
got
to
my
feet
knowing
i
picked
up
all
there
was
from
this
man
thanks
a
lot
for
your
cooperation
i
said
any
time
he
said
he
stood
and
shook
hands
with
me
i
went
back
out
through
the
chatting
prospectors
and
crossed
the
echoing
cavern
that
was
level
one
aiming
to
rent
myself
a
scooter
i
do
like
rockets
they
noisy
as
the
dickens
they
steer
hard
and
drive
erratically
and
you
can
never
carry
what
would
consider
a
safe
emergency
excess
of
fuel
nothing
like
the
big
interplanetary
liners
on
those
i
feel
almost
human
the
appearance
of
the
scooter
i
was
shown
at
the
rental
agency
did
do
much
to
raise
my
opinion
of
this
mode
of
transportation
the
thing
was
a
good
ten
years
old
the
paint
scraped
and
scratched
all
over
its
originally
body
and
the
windshield
a
silly
term
really
for
the
front
window
of
a
craft
that
spends
most
of
its
time
out
where
there
is
any
wind
was
scratched
and
pockmarked
to
the
point
of
translucency
by
years
of
exposure
to
the
asteroidal
dust
the
rental
agent
was
a
type
who
displayed
this
refugee
from
a
melting
vat
without
a
blush
and
still
did
blush
when
he
told
me
the
charges
twenty
credits
a
day
plus
fuel
i
paid
without
a
murmur
it
was
the
company
money
not
mine
and
paid
an
additional
ten
credits
for
the
rental
of
a
suit
to
go
with
it
i
worked
my
way
awkwardly
into
the
suit
and
clambered
into
the
seat
of
the
relic
i
attached
the
suit
to
the
ship
in
all
the
necessary
places
and
the
agent
closed
and
spun
the
door
most
of
the
black
paint
had
worn
off
the
handles
of
the
controls
and
insulation
peeked
through
rips
in
the
plastic
siding
here
and
there
i
wondered
if
the
thing
had
any
slow
leaks
and
supposed
fatalistically
that
it
had
the
agent
waved
at
me
the
conveyor
belt
trundled
me
outside
the
dome
and
i
kicked
the
weary
rocket
into
life
the
scooter
had
a
tendency
to
roll
to
the
right
if
i
had
kept
fighting
it
back
it
would
have
soon
worked
up
a
dandy
little
spin
i
was
spending
so
much
time
juggling
with
the
controls
that
i
practically
missed
a
couple
of
my
beacon
rocks
and
that
would
have
been
just
too
bad
if
i
gotten
off
the
course
i
had
carefully
outlined
for
myself
i
never
have
found
my
bearings
again
and
i
would
have
just
floated
around
amid
the
scenery
until
some
passerby
took
pity
and
towed
me
back
home
but
i
managed
to
avoid
getting
lost
which
surprised
me
and
after
four
hours
i
finally
spotted
the
x
of
a
registered
claim
on
a
chunk
of
rock
dead
ahead
as
i
got
closer
i
spied
a
scooter
parked
near
the
x
and
beside
it
an
inflated
portable
dome
the
scooter
was
somewhat
larger
than
mine
but
no
newer
and
probably
even
less
safe
the
dome
was
varicolored
from
repeated
patching
this
would
be
the
claim
and
this
is
where
i
would
find
karpin
sitting
on
his
property
while
waiting
for
the
sale
to
go
through
prospectors
like
karpin
are
men
working
for
no
particular
company
they
register
their
claims
in
their
own
names
and
then
sell
the
rights
to
whichever
company
shows
up
first
with
the
most
attractive
offer
a
lot
of
paperwork
to
such
a
sale
and
it
all
handled
by
the
company
while
waiting
the
smart
prospector
sits
on
his
claim
and
makes
sure
nobody
chips
off
a
part
of
it
for
himself
a
stunt
that
still
happens
now
and
again
it
does
take
too
much
concentrated
explosive
to
make
two
rocks
out
of
one
rock
and
a
man
claim
is
only
the
rock
with
his
x
on
it
i
set
the
scooter
down
next
to
the
other
one
and
flicked
the
toggle
for
the
air
pumps
then
put
on
the
fishbowl
and
went
about
unattaching
the
suit
from
the
ship
when
the
red
light
flashed
on
and
off
i
spun
the
door
opened
it
and
stepped
out
onto
the
rock
moving
very
cautiously
it
is
that
i
do
believe
the
magnets
in
the
boot
soles
will
work
it
just
that
i
know
for
a
fact
that
they
wo
work
if
i
happen
to
raise
both
feet
at
the
same
time
illustration
i
clumped
across
the
crude
x
to
karpin
dome
the
dome
had
no
viewports
at
all
so
i
was
sure
karpin
was
aware
of
my
presence
i
rapped
my
metal
glove
on
the
metal
outer
door
of
the
lock
and
then
i
was
sure
but
it
took
him
long
enough
to
open
up
i
had
just
about
decided
joined
his
partner
in
the
long
sleep
when
the
door
cracked
open
an
inch
i
pushed
it
open
and
stepped
into
the
lock
ducking
my
head
the
door
was
only
five
feet
high
and
just
as
wide
as
the
lock
itself
three
feet
the
other
dimensions
of
the
lock
were
height
six
feet
six
width
one
foot
not
exactly
room
to
dance
in
when
the
red
light
high
on
the
wall
clicked
off
i
rapped
on
the
inner
door
it
promptly
opened
i
stepped
through
and
removed
the
fishbowl
karpin
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
small
revolver
in
his
hand
shut
the
door
he
said
i
obeyed
moving
slowly
i
did
want
that
gun
to
go
off
by
mistake
who
are
you
karpin
demanded
the
m
r
man
had
been
right
ab
karpin
was
a
dead
ringer
for
all
those
other
prospectors
i
seen
back
at
atronics
city
short
and
skinny
and
grizzled
and
ageless
he
could
have
been
forty
and
he
could
have
been
ninety
but
he
was
probably
somewhere
the
other
side
of
fifty
his
hair
was
black
and
limp
and
thinning
ruffled
in
little
wisps
across
his
wrinkled
pate
his
forehead
and
cheeks
were
lined
like
a
plowed
field
and
were
much
the
same
color
his
eyes
were
wide
apart
and
small
so
beneath
shaggy
brows
that
they
seemed
black
his
mouth
was
thin
almost
lipless
the
hand
holding
the
revolver
was
nothing
but
bones
and
blue
veins
covered
with
taut
skin
he
was
wearing
a
dirty
undershirt
and
an
old
pair
of
trousers
that
had
been
cut
off
raggedly
just
above
his
knobby
knees
faded
slippers
were
on
his
feet
he
had
good
reason
for
dressing
that
way
the
temperature
inside
the
dome
must
have
been
nearly
ninety
degrees
the
dome
reflecting
away
the
sun
heat
as
well
as
it
had
when
it
was
young
i
looked
at
karpin
and
despite
the
revolver
and
the
tense
expression
on
his
face
he
was
the
least
man
i
ever
run
across
all
at
once
the
idea
that
this
old
geezer
had
the
drive
or
the
imagination
to
murder
his
partner
seemed
ridiculous
apparently
i
spent
too
much
time
looking
him
over
because
he
said
again
who
are
you
and
this
time
he
motioned
impatiently
with
the
revolver
stanton
i
told
him
ged
stanton
tangiers
mutual
insurance
i
have
identification
but
it
in
my
pants
pocket
down
inside
this
suit
get
it
he
said
and
move
slow
right
you
are
i
moved
slow
as
per
directions
and
peeled
out
of
the
suit
then
reached
into
my
trouser
pocket
and
took
out
my
id
clip
i
flipped
it
open
and
showed
him
the
card
bearing
my
signature
and
picture
and
right
and
the
name
of
the
company
i
represented
and
he
nodded
satisfied
and
tossed
the
revolver
over
onto
his
bed
i
got
to
be
careful
he
said
i
got
a
big
claim
here
i
know
that
i
told
him
congratulations
for
it
thanks
he
said
but
he
still
looked
peevish
you
here
about
jafe
insurance
right
that
i
am
do
want
to
pay
up
i
suppose
that
does
surprise
me
blunt
old
men
irritate
me
well
i
said
we
do
have
to
investigate
sure
he
said
you
want
some
coffee
thank
you
you
can
sit
in
that
chair
there
that
was
jafe
i
settled
gingerly
in
the
foldaway
chair
he
pointed
at
and
he
went
over
to
the
kitchen
area
of
the
dome
to
start
coffee
i
took
the
opportunity
to
look
the
dome
over
it
was
the
first
portable
dome
i
ever
been
inside
it
was
all
one
room
roughly
circular
with
a
diameter
of
about
fifteen
feet
the
sides
went
straight
up
for
the
first
seven
feet
then
curved
gradually
inward
to
form
the
roof
at
the
center
of
the
dome
the
ceiling
was
about
twelve
feet
high
the
floor
of
the
room
was
simply
the
asteroidal
rock
surface
not
completely
level
and
smooth
there
were
two
chairs
and
a
table
to
the
right
of
the
entry
lock
two
foldaway
cots
around
the
wall
beyond
them
the
kitchen
area
next
and
a
cluttered
storage
area
around
on
the
other
side
there
was
a
heater
standing
alone
in
the
center
of
the
room
but
it
certainly
was
needed
now
sweat
was
already
trickling
down
the
back
of
my
neck
and
down
my
forehead
into
my
eyebrows
i
peeled
off
my
shirt
and
used
it
to
wipe
sweat
from
my
face
warm
in
here
i
said
you
get
used
to
it
he
muttered
which
i
found
hard
to
believe
he
brought
over
the
coffee
and
i
tasted
it
it
was
rotten
as
bitter
as
this
old
hermit
soul
but
i
said
good
coffee
thanks
a
lot
i
like
it
strong
he
said
i
looked
around
at
the
room
again
all
the
comforts
of
home
eh
pretty
ingenious
arrangement
sure
he
said
sourly
how
about
getting
to
the
point
mister
there
only
one
way
to
handle
a
blunt
old
man
be
blunt
right
back
i
tell
you
how
it
is
i
said
the
company
is
accusing
you
of
anything
but
it
has
to
be
sure
everything
on
the
up
and
up
before
it
pays
out
any
ten
thousand
credits
and
your
partner
just
happening
to
fill
out
that
form
just
before
he
died
well
you
got
to
admit
it
is
a
funny
kind
of
coincidence
how
so
he
slurped
coffee
and
glowered
at
me
over
the
cup
we
made
this
strike
here
he
said
we
knew
it
was
the
big
one
jafe
had
that
insurance
policy
of
his
in
case
he
never
did
make
the
big
strike
as
soon
as
we
knew
this
was
the
big
one
he
said
guess
i
do
need
that
retirement
now
and
sat
right
down
and
wrote
out
the
then
we
opened
a
bottle
of
liquor
and
celebrated
and
he
got
himself
killed
the
way
karpin
said
it
it
sounded
smooth
and
natural
smooth
and
natural
how
did
this
accident
happen
anyway
i
asked
him
i
not
one
hundred
per
cent
sure
of
that
myself
he
said
i
was
pretty
well
drunk
myself
by
that
time
but
he
put
on
his
suit
and
said
he
was
going
out
to
paint
the
x
he
was
falling
all
over
himself
and
i
tried
to
tell
him
it
could
wait
till
we
had
some
sleep
but
he
would
pay
any
attention
to
me
so
he
went
out
i
said
he
nodded
he
went
out
first
after
a
couple
minutes
i
got
lonesome
in
here
so
i
suited
up
and
went
out
after
him
it
happened
just
as
i
was
going
out
the
lock
and
i
just
barely
got
a
glimpse
of
what
happened
he
attacked
the
coffee
again
noisily
and
i
prompted
him
saying
what
did
happen
mister
karpin
well
he
was
capering
around
out
there
waving
the
paint
tube
and
such
there
a
lot
of
sharp
rock
sticking
out
around
here
just
as
i
got
outside
he
lost
his
balance
and
kicked
out
and
scraped
right
into
some
of
that
rock
and
punctured
his
suit
i
thought
the
body
was
lost
i
said
he
nodded
it
was
the
last
thing
in
life
jafe
ever
did
was
try
to
shove
himself
away
from
those
rocks
that
and
the
force
of
air
coming
out
of
that
puncture
for
the
first
second
or
two
was
enough
to
throw
him
up
off
the
surface
it
threw
him
up
too
high
and
he
never
got
back
down
my
doubt
must
have
showed
in
my
face
because
he
added
mister
there
is
enough
gravity
on
this
place
to
shoot
craps
with
he
was
right
as
we
talked
i
kept
finding
myself
holding
unnecessarily
tight
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
i
kept
having
the
feeling
i
was
going
to
float
out
of
the
chair
and
hover
around
up
at
the
top
of
the
dome
if
i
were
to
let
go
it
was
silly
of
course
there
was
gravity
on
that
planetoid
after
all
but
i
just
do
seem
to
get
used
to
nevertheless
i
still
had
some
more
questions
did
you
try
to
get
his
body
back
could
you
have
reached
him
i
tried
to
mister
he
said
old
jafe
mccann
was
my
partner
for
fifteen
years
but
i
was
drunk
and
that
a
fact
and
i
was
afraid
to
go
jumping
up
in
the
air
for
fear
go
floating
away
too
frankly
i
said
i
no
expert
on
low
gravity
and
asteroids
but
would
mccann
body
just
go
into
orbit
around
this
rock
i
mean
it
would
simply
go
floating
off
into
space
would
it
it
sure
would
he
said
there
a
lot
of
other
rocks
out
here
too
mister
and
a
lot
of
them
are
bigger
than
this
one
and
have
a
lot
more
gravity
pull
i
do
suppose
there
a
navigator
in
the
business
who
could
have
computed
jafe
course
in
advance
he
floated
up
and
then
he
floated
back
over
the
dome
here
and
seemed
to
hover
for
a
couple
minutes
and
then
he
just
floated
out
and
away
his
is
the
only
body
circling
around
the
sun
with
all
these
rocks
you
know
i
chewed
a
lip
and
thought
it
all
over
i
did
know
enough
about
asteroid
gravity
or
the
conditions
out
here
to
be
able
to
say
for
sure
whether
karpin
story
was
true
or
not
up
to
this
point
i
attack
the
problem
on
a
fact
basis
i
had
to
depend
on
now
the
hunches
and
instincts
of
eight
years
in
this
job
hearing
some
people
tell
lies
and
other
people
tell
the
truth
and
my
instinct
said
ab
karpin
was
lying
in
his
teeth
that
dramatic
little
touch
about
mccann
body
hovering
over
the
dome
before
disappearing
into
the
void
that
sounded
more
like
the
embellishment
of
fiction
than
the
circumstance
of
truth
and
the
string
of
coincidences
were
just
too
much
mccann
just
coincidentally
happens
to
die
right
after
he
and
his
partner
make
their
big
strike
he
happens
to
write
out
the
form
just
before
dying
and
his
body
just
happens
to
float
away
so
nobody
can
look
at
it
and
check
karpin
story
but
no
matter
what
my
instinct
said
the
story
was
smooth
it
was
smooth
as
glass
and
there
was
no
place
for
me
to
get
a
grip
on
it
what
now
there
was
any
hole
in
karpin
story
at
least
none
that
i
could
see
i
had
to
break
his
story
somehow
and
in
order
to
do
that
i
had
to
do
some
nosing
around
on
this
planetoid
i
could
know
in
advance
what
i
was
looking
for
i
could
only
look
i
know
it
when
i
found
it
it
would
be
something
that
conflicted
with
karpin
story
and
for
that
i
had
to
be
sure
the
story
was
complete
you
said
mccann
had
gone
out
to
paint
the
x
i
said
did
he
paint
it
karpin
shook
his
head
he
never
got
a
chance
he
spent
all
his
time
dancing
up
till
he
went
and
killed
himself
so
you
painted
it
yourself
he
nodded
and
then
you
went
on
into
atronics
city
and
registered
your
claim
is
that
the
story
no
chemisant
city
was
closer
than
atronics
city
right
then
so
i
went
there
just
after
jafe
death
and
everything
i
did
feel
like
being
alone
any
more
than
i
had
to
you
said
chemisant
city
was
closer
to
you
i
said
is
it
now
things
move
around
a
lot
out
here
mister
he
said
right
now
chemisant
city
almost
twice
as
far
from
here
as
atronics
city
in
about
three
days
it
start
swinging
in
closer
again
things
keep
shifting
around
out
here
so
i
noticed
i
said
when
you
took
off
to
go
to
chemisant
city
did
you
make
a
try
for
your
partner
body
then
he
shook
his
head
he
was
long
out
of
sight
by
then
he
said
that
was
ten
eleven
hours
later
when
i
took
off
why
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
paint
the
x
and
take
off
mister
i
told
you
i
was
drunk
i
was
falling
down
drunk
and
when
i
saw
i
could
get
at
jafe
and
he
was
dead
anyway
i
came
back
in
here
and
slept
it
off
maybe
if
i
been
sober
i
would
have
taken
the
scooter
and
gone
after
him
but
i
was
i
see
and
there
just
were
any
more
questions
i
could
think
of
to
ask
not
right
now
so
i
said
i
just
had
a
shaky
ride
coming
out
here
mind
if
i
stick
around
a
while
before
going
back
help
yourself
he
said
in
a
pretty
poor
attempt
at
genial
hospitality
you
can
sleep
over
if
you
want
fine
i
said
i
think
i
like
that
you
would
happen
to
play
cribbage
would
you
he
asked
with
the
first
real
sign
of
animation
i
seen
in
him
yet
i
learn
fast
i
told
him
okay
he
said
i
teach
you
and
he
produced
a
filthy
deck
of
cards
and
taught
me
after
losing
nine
straight
games
of
cribbage
i
quit
and
got
to
my
feet
i
was
at
my
most
casual
as
i
stretched
and
said
okay
if
i
wander
around
outside
for
a
while
i
never
been
on
an
asteroid
like
this
before
i
mean
a
little
one
like
this
i
just
been
to
the
company
cities
up
to
now
go
right
ahead
he
said
i
got
some
polishing
and
patching
to
do
anyway
he
made
his
voice
sound
easy
and
innocent
but
i
noticed
his
eyes
were
alert
and
wary
watching
me
as
i
struggled
back
into
my
suit
i
did
bother
to
put
my
shirt
back
on
first
and
that
was
a
mistake
the
temperature
inside
an
atmosphere
suit
is
a
steady
degrees
that
had
never
seemed
particularly
chilly
before
but
after
the
heat
of
that
dome
it
seemed
cold
as
a
blizzard
inside
the
suit
i
went
on
out
through
the
airlock
and
moved
as
briskly
as
possible
in
the
cumbersome
suit
while
the
sweat
chilled
on
my
back
and
face
and
i
accepted
the
glum
conviction
that
one
thing
i
was
going
to
get
out
of
this
trip
for
sure
was
a
nasty
head
cold
i
went
over
to
the
x
first
and
stood
looking
at
it
it
was
just
an
x
that
all
shakily
scrawled
in
yellow
paint
with
the
initials
scrawled
much
smaller
beside
it
i
left
the
x
and
clumped
away
the
horizon
was
practically
at
length
so
it
did
take
long
for
the
dome
to
be
out
of
sight
and
then
i
clumped
more
slowly
studying
the
surface
of
the
asteroid
what
i
was
looking
for
was
a
grave
i
believed
that
karpin
was
lying
that
he
had
murdered
his
partner
and
i
did
believe
that
jafe
mccann
body
had
floated
off
into
space
i
was
convinced
that
his
body
was
still
somewhere
on
this
asteroid
karpin
had
been
forced
to
concoct
a
story
about
the
body
being
lost
because
the
appearance
of
the
body
would
prove
somehow
that
it
had
been
murder
and
not
accident
i
was
convinced
of
that
and
now
all
i
had
to
do
was
prove
it
but
that
asteroid
was
a
pretty
unlikely
place
for
a
grave
that
dirt
i
was
walking
on
it
was
rock
solid
metallic
rock
you
do
dig
a
grave
in
solid
rock
not
with
a
shovel
you
maybe
can
do
it
with
dynamite
but
that
wo
work
too
well
if
your
object
is
to
keep
anybody
from
seeing
that
the
hole
has
been
made
dirt
can
be
patted
down
rock
looks
like
rock
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
i
considered
crevices
and
fissures
in
the
surface
some
cranny
large
enough
for
karpin
to
have
stuffed
the
body
into
but
i
did
find
any
of
these
either
as
i
plodded
along
being
sure
to
keep
one
magnetted
boot
always
in
contact
with
the
ground
karpin
and
mccann
had
set
their
dome
up
at
just
about
the
only
really
level
spot
on
that
entire
planetoid
the
rest
of
it
was
nothing
but
jagged
rock
and
it
was
easy
traveling
at
all
maneuvering
around
with
magnets
on
my
boots
and
a
bulky
atmosphere
suit
cramping
my
movements
and
then
i
stopped
and
looked
out
at
space
and
cursed
myself
for
a
baboon
mccann
body
might
be
anywhere
in
the
solar
system
anywhere
at
all
but
there
was
one
place
i
could
be
sure
it
was
and
that
place
was
this
asteroid
no
karpin
had
not
blown
a
grave
or
stuffed
the
body
into
a
fissure
in
the
ground
why
not
because
this
chunk
of
rock
was
valuable
that
why
not
because
karpin
was
in
the
process
of
selling
it
to
one
of
the
major
companies
and
that
company
would
come
along
and
chop
this
chunk
of
rock
to
pieces
getting
the
valuable
metal
out
and
mccann
body
would
turn
up
in
the
first
week
of
operations
if
karpin
were
stupid
enough
to
bury
it
here
ten
hours
between
mccann
death
and
karpin
departure
for
chemisant
city
he
admitted
that
already
and
i
was
willing
to
bet
he
spent
at
least
part
of
that
time
carrying
mccann
body
to
some
other
asteroid
one
he
was
sure
was
nothing
but
worthless
rock
if
that
were
true
it
meant
the
mortal
remains
of
jafe
mccann
were
now
somewhere
in
the
asteroid
belt
even
if
i
assumed
that
the
body
had
been
hidden
on
an
asteroid
somewhere
between
here
and
chemisant
city
which
necessarily
so
that
would
help
at
all
the
relative
positions
of
planetoids
in
the
belt
just
keep
on
shifting
a
small
chunk
of
rock
that
was
between
here
and
chemisant
city
a
few
weeks
ago
it
could
be
almost
anywhere
in
the
belt
right
now
the
body
that
was
the
main
item
i
more
or
less
counted
on
finding
it
somehow
at
the
moment
i
could
think
of
any
other
angle
for
attacking
karpin
story
as
i
clopped
morosely
back
to
the
dome
i
nibbled
at
karpin
story
in
my
mind
for
instance
why
go
to
chemisant
city
it
was
closer
he
said
but
it
could
have
been
closer
by
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
the
way
i
understood
it
karpin
was
back
on
atronics
city
it
was
the
normal
base
of
operations
for
he
and
his
partner
and
he
did
know
a
soul
at
chemisant
city
did
it
make
sense
for
him
to
go
somewhere
he
was
known
after
his
partner
death
even
if
it
an
hour
closer
no
it
made
a
lot
more
sense
for
a
man
in
that
situation
to
go
where
he
known
go
someplace
where
he
has
friends
who
sympathize
with
him
and
help
him
over
the
shock
of
losing
a
partner
of
fifteen
standing
even
if
going
there
does
mean
traveling
an
hour
longer
and
there
was
always
the
form
that
was
what
i
was
here
about
in
the
first
place
it
just
did
make
sense
for
mccann
to
have
held
up
his
celebration
while
he
filled
out
a
form
that
he
would
be
able
to
mail
until
he
got
back
to
atronics
city
and
yet
the
handwriting
experts
were
convinced
that
it
was
a
forgery
and
i
could
pretty
well
take
their
word
for
it
mulling
these
things
over
as
i
tramped
back
toward
the
dome
i
suddenly
heard
a
distant
bell
ringing
way
back
in
my
head
the
glimmering
of
an
idea
not
an
idea
yet
but
just
the
hint
of
one
i
was
sure
where
it
led
or
even
if
it
led
anywhere
at
all
but
i
was
going
to
find
out
karpin
opened
the
doors
for
me
by
the
time
i
stripped
off
the
suit
he
was
back
to
work
he
was
cleaning
the
single
unit
which
was
his
combination
stove
and
refrigerator
and
sink
and
garbage
disposal
i
looked
around
the
dome
again
and
i
had
to
admit
that
a
lot
of
ingenuity
had
gone
into
the
manufacture
and
design
of
this
dome
and
its
contents
the
dome
itself
when
deflated
folded
down
into
an
oblong
box
three
feet
by
one
foot
by
one
foot
the
lock
itself
of
course
folded
separately
into
another
box
somewhat
smaller
than
that
as
for
the
gear
inside
the
dome
it
was
functional
and
collapsible
and
there
was
a
single
item
there
that
was
needed
there
were
the
two
chairs
and
the
two
cots
and
the
table
all
of
them
foldaway
there
was
that
fantastic
combination
job
karpin
was
cleaning
right
now
and
that
had
dimensions
of
four
feet
by
three
feet
by
three
feet
the
clutter
of
gear
over
to
the
left
was
as
much
of
a
clutter
as
it
looked
there
was
a
geiger
counter
an
automatic
spectrograph
two
atmosphere
suits
a
torsion
densimeter
a
drill
a
few
small
hammers
and
picks
two
spare
air
tanks
boxes
of
food
concentrate
a
paint
tube
a
doorless
and
two
small
metal
boxes
about
eight
inches
cube
these
last
were
undoubtedly
karpin
and
mccann
pouches
where
they
kept
whatever
letters
money
address
books
or
other
small
bits
of
possessions
they
owned
back
of
this
mound
of
gear
against
the
wall
stood
the
air
reconditioner
humming
quietly
to
itself
in
this
small
enclosed
space
there
was
everything
a
man
needed
to
keep
himself
alive
everything
except
human
company
and
if
you
did
need
human
company
then
you
had
everything
just
on
the
other
side
of
that
dome
there
was
a
million
miles
of
death
in
a
million
possible
ways
on
this
side
of
the
dome
life
was
cozy
if
somewhat
spartan
and
very
hot
i
knew
for
sure
i
was
going
to
get
a
head
cold
my
body
had
adjusted
to
the
degrees
inside
the
suit
finally
and
now
was
very
annoyed
to
find
the
temperature
shooting
up
to
ninety
again
since
karpin
did
seem
inclined
to
talk
and
i
would
rather
spend
my
time
thinking
than
talking
anyway
i
took
a
hint
from
him
and
did
some
cleaning
i
noticed
a
smeared
spot
about
on
the
faceplate
of
my
fishbowl
and
now
was
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
get
rid
of
it
it
had
a
tendency
to
make
my
eyes
cross
my
shirt
was
sodden
and
wrinkled
by
this
time
anyway
having
first
been
used
to
wipe
sweat
from
my
face
and
later
been
rolled
into
a
ball
and
left
on
the
chair
when
i
went
outside
so
i
used
it
for
a
cleaning
rag
buffing
like
mad
the
silvered
surface
of
the
faceplate
faceplates
are
silvered
not
so
the
man
inside
can
look
out
and
no
one
else
can
look
in
but
in
order
to
keep
some
of
the
more
violent
rays
of
the
sun
from
getting
through
to
the
face
i
buffed
for
a
while
and
then
i
put
the
fishbowl
on
my
head
and
looked
through
it
the
spot
was
gone
so
i
went
over
and
reattached
it
to
the
rest
of
the
suit
and
then
settled
back
in
my
chair
again
and
lit
a
cigarette
karpin
spoke
up
wish
you
would
smoke
makes
it
tough
on
the
conditioner
oh
i
said
sorry
so
i
just
sat
thinking
morosely
about
forms
and
coincidences
and
likely
spots
to
hide
a
body
in
the
asteroid
belt
where
would
one
dispose
of
a
body
in
the
asteroids
i
went
back
through
my
thinking
on
that
topic
and
i
found
holes
big
enough
to
drive
karpin
claim
through
this
idea
of
leaving
the
body
on
some
worthless
chunk
of
rock
for
instance
if
karpin
had
killed
his
partner
and
i
was
dead
sure
he
had
he
planned
it
carefully
and
he
would
be
leaving
anything
to
chance
now
an
asteroid
is
worthless
to
a
prospector
until
that
prospector
has
landed
on
it
and
tested
it
might
know
that
an
asteroid
was
nothing
but
worthless
stone
but
the
guy
who
stops
there
and
finds
mccann
body
might
know
it
no
karpin
would
leave
that
to
chance
he
would
get
rid
of
that
body
and
he
would
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
would
find
it
how
not
by
leaving
it
on
a
worthless
asteroid
and
not
by
just
pushing
it
off
into
space
the
distance
between
asteroids
is
large
but
so
the
travel
mccann
body
floating
around
in
the
blackness
might
just
be
found
by
somebody
and
that
so
far
as
i
could
see
eliminated
the
possibilities
body
was
in
the
belt
i
eliminated
both
the
asteroids
themselves
and
the
space
around
the
asteroids
as
hiding
places
what
was
left
the
sun
of
course
i
thought
that
over
for
a
while
rather
surprised
at
myself
for
having
noticed
the
possibility
now
let
say
karpin
attaches
a
small
rocket
to
mccann
body
stuffed
into
its
atmosphere
suit
he
sets
the
rocket
going
and
off
goes
mccann
not
that
he
aims
it
toward
the
sun
that
would
work
well
at
all
instead
of
falling
into
the
sun
the
body
would
simply
take
up
a
long
elliptical
orbit
the
sun
and
would
come
back
to
the
asteroids
every
few
hundred
years
no
he
would
aim
mccann
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
direction
or
rotation
of
the
asteroids
he
would
in
essence
slow
mccann
body
down
make
it
practically
stop
in
relation
to
the
motion
of
the
asteroids
and
then
it
would
simply
into
the
sun
none
of
my
ideas
it
seemed
were
happy
ones
if
mccann
body
were
even
at
this
moment
falling
toward
the
sun
it
was
just
as
useful
to
me
as
if
it
were
on
some
other
asteroid
but
wait
a
second
karpin
and
mccann
had
worked
with
the
minimum
of
equipment
i
already
noticed
that
they
did
have
extras
of
anything
and
they
certainly
would
have
extra
rockets
except
for
one
fast
trip
to
chemisant
city
when
he
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
excuse
to
buy
a
jato
rocket
karpin
had
spent
all
of
his
time
since
death
right
here
on
this
planetoid
so
that
killed
that
idea
while
i
was
hunting
around
for
some
other
idea
karpin
spoke
up
again
for
the
first
time
in
maybe
twenty
minutes
you
think
i
killed
him
do
you
he
said
not
looking
around
from
his
cleaning
job
i
considered
my
answer
there
was
no
reason
at
all
to
be
overly
polite
to
this
sour
old
buzzard
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
naturally
the
type
we
are
sure
i
said
we
just
think
there
are
some
odd
items
to
be
explained
such
as
what
he
demanded
such
as
the
timing
of
mccann
form
i
already
explained
that
he
said
i
know
you
explained
everything
he
wrote
it
out
himself
the
old
man
insisted
he
put
down
his
cleaning
cloth
and
turned
to
face
me
i
suppose
your
company
checked
the
handwriting
already
and
jafe
mccann
is
the
one
who
wrote
that
form
he
was
so
blasted
sure
of
himself
it
would
seem
that
way
i
said
what
other
odd
items
you
worried
about
he
asked
me
in
a
rusty
attempt
at
sarcasm
well
i
said
there
this
business
of
going
to
chemisant
city
it
would
have
made
more
sense
for
you
to
go
to
atronics
city
where
you
were
known
chemisant
was
closer
he
said
he
shook
a
finger
at
me
that
company
of
yours
thinks
it
can
cheat
me
out
of
my
money
he
said
well
it
ca
i
know
my
rights
that
money
belongs
to
me
i
guess
you
doing
pretty
well
without
mccann
i
said
his
angry
expression
was
replaced
by
one
of
bewilderment
what
do
you
mean
they
told
me
back
at
atronics
city
i
explained
that
mccann
was
the
money
expert
and
you
were
the
metals
expert
and
that
why
mccann
handled
all
your
buying
on
credit
and
stuff
like
that
looks
as
though
you
got
a
pretty
keen
eye
for
money
yourself
i
know
what
mine
he
mumbled
and
turned
away
he
went
back
to
scrubbing
the
stove
coils
again
i
stared
at
his
back
something
had
happened
just
then
and
i
sure
what
he
just
been
starting
to
warm
up
to
a
tirade
against
the
dirty
insurance
company
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
folded
up
and
shut
up
like
a
clam
and
then
i
saw
it
or
at
least
i
saw
part
of
it
i
saw
how
that
form
fit
in
and
how
it
made
perfect
sense
now
all
i
needed
was
proof
of
murder
preferably
a
body
i
had
the
rest
of
it
then
i
could
pack
the
old
geezer
back
to
atronics
city
and
get
proof
for
the
part
i
already
figured
out
i
like
that
i
like
getting
back
to
atronics
city
and
having
this
all
straightened
out
and
then
taking
the
very
next
liner
straight
back
to
earth
more
immediately
i
like
getting
out
of
this
heat
and
back
into
the
cool
degrees
of
and
then
it
hit
me
the
whole
thing
hit
me
and
i
just
sat
there
and
stared
they
did
not
carry
extras
karpin
and
mccann
they
did
not
carry
one
item
of
equipment
more
than
they
needed
i
sat
there
and
looked
at
the
place
where
the
dead
body
was
hidden
and
i
said
well
i
be
a
son
of
a
gun
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
and
then
he
followed
the
direction
of
my
gaze
and
he
saw
what
i
was
staring
at
and
he
made
a
jump
across
the
room
at
the
revolver
lying
on
the
cot
that
what
saved
me
he
moved
too
fast
jerked
his
muscles
too
hard
and
went
sailing
up
and
over
the
cot
and
ricocheted
off
the
dome
wall
and
that
gave
me
plenty
of
time
to
get
up
from
the
chair
moving
more
cautiously
than
he
had
and
get
my
hands
on
the
revolver
before
he
could
get
himself
squared
away
again
i
straightened
with
the
gun
in
my
hand
and
looked
into
a
face
white
with
frustration
and
rage
okay
mister
mccann
i
said
it
all
over
he
knew
i
had
him
but
he
tried
not
to
show
it
what
are
you
talking
about
mccann
dead
sure
he
is
i
said
jafe
mccann
was
the
part
of
the
team
he
was
the
one
who
signed
for
all
the
loans
and
all
the
equipment
bought
on
credit
with
this
big
strike
in
jafe
mccann
was
the
one
have
to
pay
all
that
money
you
babbling
he
snapped
but
the
words
were
hollow
you
were
satisfied
with
half
a
loaf
i
said
you
should
have
been
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
none
but
you
wanted
every
penny
you
could
get
your
hands
on
and
you
wanted
to
pay
out
just
as
little
money
as
you
possibly
could
so
when
you
killed
ab
karpin
you
saw
a
way
to
kill
your
debts
as
well
you
ab
karpin
and
it
would
be
jafe
mccann
who
was
dead
and
the
debts
dead
with
him
that
a
lie
he
said
his
voice
getting
shrill
ab
karpin
and
i
got
papers
to
prove
it
sure
papers
you
stole
from
a
dead
man
and
you
might
have
gotten
away
with
it
too
but
you
just
could
leave
well
enough
alone
could
you
not
satisfied
with
having
the
whole
claim
to
yourself
you
switched
identities
with
your
victim
to
avoid
your
debts
and
not
satisfied
with
you
filled
out
a
form
and
tried
to
collect
your
money
as
your
own
heir
why
you
had
to
go
to
chemisant
city
where
nobody
would
recognize
ab
karpin
or
jafe
mccann
rather
than
to
atronics
city
where
you
were
you
do
want
to
make
too
many
wild
accusations
he
shouted
his
voice
shaking
you
do
want
to
go
around
accusing
people
of
things
you
ca
prove
i
can
prove
it
i
told
him
i
can
prove
everything
i
said
as
to
who
you
are
there
no
problem
all
i
have
to
do
is
bring
you
back
to
atronics
city
there
be
plenty
of
people
there
to
identify
you
and
as
to
proving
you
murdered
ab
karpin
i
think
his
body
will
be
proof
enough
do
you
mccann
watched
me
as
i
backed
slowly
around
the
room
to
the
mound
of
gear
the
partners
had
had
no
extra
equipment
no
extra
equipment
at
all
i
looked
down
at
the
two
atmosphere
suits
lying
side
by
side
on
the
metallic
rock
floor
atmosphere
suits
the
dead
man
was
supposed
to
be
in
one
of
those
floating
out
in
space
somewhere
he
was
in
the
suit
right
enough
i
was
sure
of
that
but
he
was
floating
anywhere
a
space
suit
is
a
perfect
place
to
hide
a
body
for
as
long
as
it
has
to
be
hid
the
silvered
faceplate
keeps
you
from
seeing
inside
and
the
suit
is
naturally
a
sealed
atmosphere
a
body
can
rot
away
to
ashes
inside
a
space
suit
and
you
never
notice
a
thing
on
the
outside
i
had
the
right
idea
after
all
mccann
had
planned
to
get
rid
of
karpin
body
by
attaching
a
rocket
to
it
slowing
it
down
and
letting
it
fall
into
the
sun
but
he
had
had
an
opportunity
yet
to
go
buy
a
rocket
he
could
go
to
atronics
city
where
he
could
have
bought
the
rocket
on
credit
and
he
could
go
to
chemisant
city
until
the
claim
sale
went
through
and
he
had
some
money
to
spend
and
in
the
meantime
karpin
body
was
perfectly
safe
sealed
away
inside
his
atmosphere
suit
and
it
would
have
been
safe
too
if
mccann
had
been
just
a
little
bit
too
greedy
he
could
kill
his
partner
and
get
away
with
it
policemen
on
the
belt
are
even
farther
apart
than
the
asteroids
he
could
swindle
his
creditors
and
get
away
with
it
they
had
no
way
of
checking
up
and
no
reason
to
suspect
a
switch
in
identities
but
when
he
tried
to
get
his
own
money
back
from
tangiers
mutual
insurance
when
he
made
his
mistake
i
studied
the
two
atmosphere
suits
at
the
same
time
managing
to
keep
a
wary
eye
on
jafe
mccann
standing
rigid
and
silent
across
the
room
which
one
of
those
suits
contained
the
body
of
ab
karpin
the
one
with
the
new
patch
on
the
chest
of
course
as
i
guessed
mccann
had
shot
him
and
that
why
he
had
the
problem
of
disposing
of
the
body
in
the
first
place
i
prodded
that
suit
with
my
toe
he
in
there
is
he
you
crazy
think
i
should
open
it
up
and
check
it
been
almost
a
month
you
know
i
imagine
he
pretty
ripe
by
now
i
reached
down
to
the
on
the
fishbowl
and
mccann
finally
moved
his
arms
jerked
up
and
he
cried
do
he
in
there
he
in
there
for
god
sake
do
open
it
up
i
relaxed
mission
accomplished
crawl
into
your
suit
little
man
i
said
we
got
ourselves
a
trip
to
make
the
three
of
us
henderson
as
usual
was
jovial
but
stern
you
did
a
fine
job
up
there
ged
he
said
with
false
familiarity
really
brilliant
work
thank
you
very
much
i
said
i
was
holding
the
last
piece
of
news
for
a
minute
or
two
relishing
it
but
you
brought
mccann
in
over
a
week
ago
i
do
see
why
you
had
to
stay
up
at
atronics
city
at
all
after
that
much
less
ten
days
i
sat
back
in
the
chair
and
negligently
crossed
my
legs
i
just
thought
i
take
a
little
vacation
i
said
carelessly
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
flicked
ashes
in
the
general
direction
of
the
ashtray
on
desk
some
of
them
made
it
a
vacation
he
echoed
eyes
widening
henderson
was
a
company
man
a
company
man
a
vacation
for
him
was
purgatory
it
was
separation
from
a
loved
one
i
do
believe
you
have
a
vacation
coming
he
said
frostily
for
at
least
six
months
that
what
you
think
henny
i
said
all
he
could
do
at
that
was
blink
i
went
on
enjoying
myself
hugely
i
do
like
this
company
i
said
and
i
do
like
this
job
and
i
do
like
you
and
from
now
on
decided
it
going
to
be
vacation
all
the
time
ged
he
said
his
voice
faint
what
the
matter
with
you
do
you
feel
well
i
feel
well
i
told
him
i
feel
fine
now
i
tell
you
why
i
spent
an
extra
ten
days
at
atronics
city
mccann
made
and
registered
the
big
strike
right
henderson
nodded
blankly
apparently
not
trusting
himself
to
speak
wrong
i
said
cheerfully
mccann
went
to
chemisant
city
and
filled
out
all
the
forms
required
for
registering
a
claim
but
every
place
he
was
supposed
to
sign
his
name
he
wrote
instead
jafe
mccann
did
make
a
legal
registration
of
his
henderson
just
looked
so
i
went
on
as
soon
as
i
turned
mccann
over
to
the
law
at
atronics
city
i
went
and
registered
that
claim
myself
and
then
i
waited
around
for
ten
days
until
the
company
finished
the
paperwork
involved
in
buying
that
claim
from
me
and
then
i
came
straight
back
here
just
to
say
goodbye
to
you
was
that
nice
he
did
move
goodbye
i
said
