the
rough
riders
by
theodore
roosevelt
on
behalf
of
the
rough
riders
i
dedicate
this
book
to
the
officers
and
men
of
the
five
regular
regiments
which
together
with
mine
made
up
the
cavalry
division
at
santiago
i
raising
the
regiment
during
the
year
preceding
the
outbreak
of
the
spanish
war
i
was
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
while
my
party
was
in
opposition
i
had
preached
with
all
the
fervor
and
zeal
i
possessed
our
duty
to
intervene
in
cuba
and
to
take
this
opportunity
of
driving
the
spaniard
from
the
western
world
now
that
my
party
had
come
to
power
i
felt
it
incumbent
on
me
by
word
and
deed
to
do
all
i
could
to
secure
the
carrying
out
of
the
policy
in
which
i
so
heartily
believed
and
from
the
beginning
i
had
determined
that
if
a
war
came
somehow
or
other
i
was
going
to
the
front
meanwhile
there
was
any
amount
of
work
at
hand
in
getting
ready
the
navy
and
to
this
i
devoted
myself
naturally
when
one
is
intensely
interested
in
a
certain
cause
the
tendency
is
to
associate
particularly
with
those
who
take
the
same
view
a
large
number
of
my
friends
felt
very
differently
from
the
way
i
felt
and
looked
upon
the
possibility
of
war
with
sincere
horror
but
i
found
plenty
of
sympathizers
especially
in
the
navy
the
army
and
the
senate
committee
on
foreign
affairs
commodore
dewey
captain
evans
captain
brownson
captain
davis
with
these
and
the
various
other
naval
officers
on
duty
at
washington
i
used
to
hold
long
consultations
during
which
we
went
over
and
over
not
only
every
question
of
naval
administration
but
specifically
everything
necessary
to
do
in
order
to
put
the
navy
in
trim
to
strike
quick
and
hard
if
as
we
believed
would
be
the
case
we
went
to
war
with
spain
sending
an
ample
quantity
of
ammunition
to
the
asiatic
squadron
and
providing
it
with
coal
getting
the
and
the
armored
cruisers
on
the
atlantic
into
one
squadron
both
to
train
them
in
manoeuvring
together
and
to
have
them
ready
to
sail
against
either
the
cuban
or
the
spanish
coasts
gathering
the
into
a
flotilla
for
practice
securing
ample
target
exercise
so
conducted
as
to
raise
the
standard
of
our
marksmanship
gathering
in
the
small
ships
from
european
and
south
american
waters
settling
on
the
number
and
kind
of
craft
needed
as
auxiliary
cruisers
every
one
of
these
points
was
threshed
over
in
conversations
with
officers
who
were
present
in
washington
or
in
correspondence
with
officers
who
like
captain
mahan
were
absent
as
for
the
senators
of
course
senator
lodge
and
i
felt
precisely
alike
for
to
fight
in
such
a
cause
and
with
such
an
enemy
was
merely
to
carry
out
the
doctrines
we
had
both
of
us
preached
for
many
years
senator
davis
senator
proctor
senator
foraker
senator
chandler
senator
morgan
senator
frye
and
a
number
of
others
also
took
just
the
right
ground
and
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
them
as
well
as
of
many
members
of
the
house
particularly
those
from
the
west
where
the
feeling
for
war
was
strongest
naval
officers
came
and
went
and
senators
were
only
in
the
city
while
the
senate
was
in
session
but
there
was
one
friend
who
was
steadily
in
washington
this
was
an
army
surgeon
leonard
wood
i
only
met
him
after
i
entered
the
navy
department
but
we
soon
found
that
we
had
kindred
tastes
and
kindred
principles
he
had
served
in
general
miles
inconceivably
harassing
campaigns
against
the
apaches
where
he
had
displayed
such
courage
that
he
won
that
most
coveted
of
distinctions
the
medal
of
honor
such
extraordinary
physical
strength
and
endurance
that
he
grew
to
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
two
or
three
white
men
who
could
stand
fatigue
and
hardship
as
well
as
an
apache
and
such
judgment
that
toward
the
close
of
the
campaigns
he
was
given
though
a
surgeon
the
actual
command
of
more
than
one
expedition
against
the
bands
of
renegade
indians
like
so
many
of
the
gallant
fighters
with
whom
it
was
later
my
good
fortune
to
serve
he
combined
in
a
very
high
degree
the
qualities
of
entire
manliness
with
entire
uprightness
and
cleanliness
of
character
it
was
a
pleasure
to
deal
with
a
man
of
high
ideals
who
scorned
everything
mean
and
base
and
who
also
possessed
those
robust
and
hardy
qualities
of
body
and
mind
for
the
lack
of
which
no
merely
negative
virtue
can
ever
atone
he
was
by
nature
a
soldier
of
the
highest
type
and
like
most
natural
soldiers
he
was
of
course
born
with
a
keen
longing
for
adventure
and
though
an
excellent
doctor
what
he
really
desired
was
the
chance
to
lead
men
in
some
kind
of
hazard
to
every
possibility
of
such
adventure
he
paid
quick
attention
for
instance
he
had
a
great
desire
to
get
me
to
go
with
him
on
an
expedition
into
the
klondike
in
at
the
time
when
it
was
thought
that
a
relief
party
would
have
to
be
sent
there
to
help
the
starving
miners
in
the
summer
he
and
i
took
long
walks
together
through
the
beautiful
broken
country
surrounding
washington
in
winter
we
sometimes
varied
these
walks
by
kicking
a
in
an
empty
lot
or
on
the
rare
occasions
when
there
was
enough
snow
by
trying
a
couple
of
sets
of
skis
or
which
had
been
sent
me
from
canada
but
always
on
our
way
out
to
and
back
from
these
walks
and
sport
there
was
one
topic
to
which
in
our
talking
we
returned
and
that
was
the
possible
war
with
spain
we
both
felt
very
strongly
that
such
a
war
would
be
as
righteous
as
it
would
be
advantageous
to
the
honor
and
the
interests
of
the
nation
and
after
the
blowing
up
of
the
maine
we
felt
that
it
was
inevitable
we
then
at
once
began
to
try
to
see
that
we
had
our
share
in
it
the
president
and
my
own
chief
secretary
long
were
very
firm
against
my
going
but
they
said
that
if
i
was
bent
upon
going
they
would
help
me
wood
was
the
medical
adviser
of
both
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
war
and
could
count
upon
their
friendship
so
we
started
with
the
odds
in
our
favor
at
first
we
had
great
difficulty
in
knowing
exactly
what
to
try
for
we
could
go
on
the
staff
of
any
one
of
several
generals
but
we
much
preferred
to
go
in
the
line
wood
hoped
he
might
get
a
commission
in
his
native
state
of
massachusetts
but
in
massachusetts
as
in
every
other
state
it
proved
there
were
ten
men
who
wanted
to
go
to
the
war
for
every
chance
to
go
then
we
thought
we
might
get
positions
as
under
an
old
friend
of
mine
colonel
now
general
francis
greene
of
new
york
the
colonel
of
the
but
again
there
were
no
vacancies
our
doubts
were
resolved
when
congress
authorized
the
raising
of
three
cavalry
regiments
from
among
the
wild
riders
and
riflemen
of
the
rockies
and
the
great
plains
during
wood
service
in
the
southwest
he
had
commanded
not
only
regulars
and
indian
scouts
but
also
white
frontiersmen
in
the
northwest
i
had
spent
much
of
my
time
for
many
years
either
on
my
ranch
or
in
long
hunting
trips
and
had
lived
and
worked
for
months
together
with
the
cowboy
and
the
mountain
hunter
faring
in
every
way
precisely
as
they
did
secretary
alger
offered
me
the
command
of
one
of
these
regiments
if
i
had
taken
it
being
entirely
inexperienced
in
military
work
i
should
not
have
known
how
to
get
it
equipped
most
rapidly
for
i
should
have
spent
valuable
weeks
in
learning
its
needs
with
the
result
that
i
should
have
missed
the
santiago
campaign
and
might
not
even
have
had
the
consolation
prize
of
going
to
porto
rico
fortunately
i
was
wise
enough
to
tell
the
secretary
that
while
i
believed
i
could
learn
to
command
the
regiment
in
a
month
that
it
was
just
this
very
month
which
i
could
not
afford
to
spare
and
that
therefore
i
would
be
quite
content
to
go
as
if
he
would
make
wood
colonel
this
was
entirely
satisfactory
to
both
the
president
and
secretary
and
accordingly
wood
and
i
were
speedily
commissioned
as
colonel
and
of
the
first
united
states
volunteer
cavalry
this
was
the
official
title
of
the
regiment
but
for
some
reason
or
other
the
public
promptly
christened
us
the
rough
riders
at
first
we
fought
against
the
use
of
the
term
but
to
no
purpose
and
when
finally
the
generals
of
division
and
brigade
began
to
write
in
formal
communications
about
our
regiment
as
the
rough
riders
we
adopted
the
term
ourselves
the
for
the
regiment
were
appointed
in
new
mexico
arizona
oklahoma
and
indian
territory
the
difficulty
in
organizing
was
not
in
selecting
but
in
rejecting
men
within
a
day
or
two
after
it
was
announced
that
we
were
to
raise
the
regiment
we
were
literally
deluged
with
applications
from
every
quarter
of
the
union
without
the
slightest
trouble
so
far
as
men
went
we
could
have
raised
a
brigade
or
even
a
division
the
difficulty
lay
in
arming
equipping
mounting
and
disciplining
the
men
we
selected
hundreds
of
regiments
were
being
called
into
existence
by
the
national
government
and
each
regiment
was
sure
to
have
innumerable
wants
to
be
satisfied
to
a
man
who
knew
the
ground
as
wood
did
and
who
was
entirely
aware
of
our
national
unpreparedness
it
was
evident
that
the
ordnance
and
bureaus
could
not
meet
for
some
time
to
come
of
the
demands
that
would
be
made
upon
them
and
it
was
to
get
in
first
with
our
demands
thanks
to
his
knowledge
of
the
situation
and
promptness
we
immediately
put
in
our
requisitions
for
the
articles
indispensable
for
the
equipment
of
the
regiment
and
then
by
ceaseless
worrying
of
excellent
bureaucrats
who
had
no
idea
how
to
do
things
quickly
or
how
to
meet
an
emergency
we
succeeded
in
getting
our
rifles
cartridges
revolvers
clothing
and
horse
gear
just
in
time
to
enable
us
to
go
on
the
santiago
expedition
some
of
the
state
troops
who
were
already
organized
as
national
guards
were
of
course
ready
after
a
fashion
when
the
war
broke
out
but
no
other
regiment
which
had
our
work
to
do
was
able
to
do
it
in
anything
like
as
quick
time
and
therefore
no
other
volunteer
regiment
saw
anything
like
the
fighting
which
we
did
wood
thoroughly
realized
what
the
ordnance
department
failed
to
realize
namely
the
inestimable
advantage
of
smokeless
powder
and
moreover
he
was
bent
upon
our
having
the
weapons
of
the
regulars
for
this
meant
that
we
would
be
brigaded
with
them
and
it
was
evident
that
they
would
do
the
bulk
of
the
fighting
if
the
war
were
short
accordingly
by
acting
with
the
utmost
vigor
and
promptness
he
succeeded
in
getting
our
regiment
armed
with
the
carbine
used
by
the
regular
cavalry
it
was
impossible
to
take
any
of
the
numerous
companies
which
were
proffered
to
us
from
the
various
states
the
only
organized
bodies
we
were
at
liberty
to
accept
were
those
from
the
four
territories
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
number
of
men
originally
allotted
to
us
was
speedily
raised
to
we
were
given
a
chance
to
accept
quite
a
number
of
eager
volunteers
who
did
not
come
from
the
territories
but
who
possessed
precisely
the
same
temper
that
distinguished
our
southwestern
recruits
and
whose
presence
materially
benefited
the
regiment
we
drew
recruits
from
harvard
yale
princeton
and
many
another
college
from
clubs
like
the
somerset
of
boston
and
knickerbocker
of
new
york
and
from
among
the
men
who
belonged
neither
to
club
nor
to
college
but
in
whose
veins
the
blood
stirred
with
the
same
impulse
which
once
sent
the
vikings
over
sea
four
of
the
policemen
who
had
served
under
me
while
i
was
president
of
the
new
york
police
board
insisted
on
coming
two
of
them
to
die
the
other
two
to
return
unhurt
after
honorable
and
dangerous
service
it
seemed
to
me
that
almost
every
friend
i
had
in
every
state
had
some
one
acquaintance
who
was
bound
to
go
with
the
rough
riders
and
for
whom
i
had
to
make
a
place
thomas
nelson
page
general
fitzhugh
lee
congressman
odell
of
new
york
senator
morgan
for
each
of
these
and
for
many
others
i
eventually
consented
to
accept
some
one
or
two
recruits
of
course
only
after
a
most
rigid
examination
into
their
physical
capacity
and
after
they
had
shown
that
they
knew
how
to
ride
and
shoot
i
may
add
that
in
no
case
was
i
disappointed
in
the
men
thus
taken
harvard
being
my
own
college
i
had
such
a
swarm
of
applications
from
it
that
i
could
not
take
one
in
ten
what
particularly
pleased
me
not
only
in
the
harvard
but
the
yale
and
princeton
men
and
indeed
in
these
recruits
from
the
older
states
generally
was
that
they
did
not
ask
for
commissions
with
hardly
an
exception
they
entered
upon
their
duties
as
troopers
in
the
spirit
which
they
held
to
the
end
merely
endeavoring
to
show
that
no
work
could
be
too
hard
too
disagreeable
or
too
dangerous
for
them
to
perform
and
neither
asking
nor
receiving
any
reward
in
the
way
of
promotion
or
consideration
the
harvard
contingent
was
practically
raised
by
guy
murchie
of
maine
he
saw
all
the
fighting
and
did
his
duty
with
the
utmost
gallantry
and
then
left
the
service
as
he
had
entered
it
a
trooper
entirely
satisfied
to
have
done
his
duty
and
no
man
did
it
better
so
it
was
with
dudley
dean
perhaps
the
best
quarterback
who
ever
played
on
a
harvard
eleven
and
so
with
bob
wrenn
a
quarterback
whose
feats
rivalled
those
of
dean
and
who
in
addition
was
the
champion
tennis
player
of
america
and
had
on
two
different
years
saved
this
championship
from
going
to
an
englishman
so
it
was
with
yale
men
like
waller
the
high
jumper
and
garrison
and
girard
and
with
princeton
men
like
devereux
and
channing
the
players
with
larned
the
tennis
player
with
craig
wadsworth
the
rider
with
joe
stevens
the
crack
polo
player
with
hamilton
fish
the
of
the
columbia
crew
and
with
scores
of
others
whose
names
are
quite
as
worthy
of
mention
as
any
of
those
i
have
given
indeed
they
all
sought
entry
into
the
ranks
of
the
rough
riders
as
eagerly
as
if
it
meant
something
widely
different
from
hard
work
rough
fare
and
the
possibility
of
death
and
the
reason
why
they
turned
out
to
be
such
good
soldiers
lay
largely
in
the
fact
that
they
were
men
who
had
thoroughly
counted
the
cost
before
entering
and
who
went
into
the
regiment
because
they
believed
that
this
offered
their
best
chance
for
seeing
hard
and
dangerous
service
mason
mitchell
of
new
york
who
had
been
a
chief
of
scouts
in
the
riel
rebellion
travelled
all
the
way
to
san
antonio
to
enlist
and
others
came
there
from
distances
as
great
some
of
them
made
appeals
to
me
which
i
could
not
possibly
resist
woodbury
kane
had
been
a
close
friend
of
mine
at
harvard
during
the
eighteen
years
that
had
passed
since
my
graduation
i
had
seen
very
little
of
him
though
being
always
interested
in
sport
i
occasionally
met
him
on
the
hunting
field
had
seen
him
on
the
deck
of
the
defender
when
she
vanquished
the
valkyrie
and
knew
the
part
he
had
played
on
the
navajoe
when
in
her
most
important
race
that
otherwise
unlucky
yacht
vanquished
her
opponent
the
prince
of
britannia
when
the
war
was
on
kane
felt
it
his
duty
to
fight
for
his
country
he
did
not
seek
any
position
of
distinction
all
he
desired
was
the
chance
to
do
whatever
work
he
was
put
to
do
well
and
to
get
to
the
front
and
he
enlisted
as
a
trooper
when
i
went
down
to
the
camp
at
san
antonio
he
was
on
kitchen
duty
and
was
cooking
and
washing
dishes
for
one
of
the
new
mexican
troops
and
he
was
doing
it
so
well
that
i
had
no
further
doubt
as
to
how
he
would
get
on
my
friend
of
many
hunts
and
ranch
partner
robert
munro
ferguson
of
scotland
who
had
been
on
lord
aberdeen
staff
as
a
lieutenant
but
a
year
before
likewise
could
not
keep
out
of
the
regiment
he
too
appealed
to
me
in
terms
which
i
could
not
withstand
and
came
in
like
kane
to
do
his
full
duty
as
a
trooper
and
like
kane
to
win
his
commission
by
the
way
he
thus
did
his
duty
i
felt
many
qualms
at
first
in
allowing
men
of
this
stamp
to
come
in
for
i
could
not
be
certain
that
they
had
counted
the
cost
and
was
afraid
they
would
find
it
very
hard
to
serve
not
for
a
few
days
but
for
months
in
the
ranks
while
i
their
former
intimate
associate
was
a
but
they
insisted
that
they
knew
their
minds
and
the
events
showed
that
they
did
we
enlisted
about
fifty
of
them
from
virginia
maryland
and
the
northeastern
states
at
washington
before
allowing
them
to
be
sworn
in
i
gathered
them
together
and
explained
that
if
they
went
in
they
must
be
prepared
not
merely
to
fight
but
to
perform
the
weary
monotonous
labor
incident
to
the
ordinary
routine
of
a
soldier
life
that
they
must
be
ready
to
face
fever
exactly
as
they
were
to
face
bullets
that
they
were
to
obey
unquestioningly
and
to
do
their
duty
as
readily
if
called
upon
to
garrison
a
fort
as
if
sent
to
the
front
i
warned
them
that
work
that
was
merely
irksome
and
disagreeable
must
be
faced
as
readily
as
work
that
was
dangerous
and
that
no
complaint
of
any
kind
must
be
made
and
i
told
them
that
they
were
entirely
at
liberty
not
to
go
but
that
after
they
had
once
signed
there
could
then
be
no
backing
out
not
a
man
of
them
backed
out
not
one
of
them
failed
to
do
his
whole
duty
these
men
formed
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
whole
they
went
down
to
san
antonio
where
the
regiment
was
to
gather
and
where
wood
preceded
me
while
i
spent
a
week
in
washington
hurrying
up
the
different
bureaus
and
telegraphing
my
various
railroad
friends
so
as
to
insure
our
getting
the
carbines
saddles
and
uniforms
that
we
needed
from
the
various
armories
and
storehouses
then
i
went
down
to
san
antonio
myself
where
i
found
the
men
from
new
mexico
arizona
and
oklahoma
already
gathered
while
those
from
indian
territory
came
in
soon
after
my
arrival
these
were
the
men
who
made
up
the
bulk
of
the
regiment
and
gave
it
its
peculiar
character
they
came
from
the
four
territories
which
yet
remained
within
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
that
is
from
the
lands
that
have
been
most
recently
won
over
to
white
civilization
and
in
which
the
conditions
of
life
are
nearest
those
that
obtained
on
the
frontier
when
there
still
was
a
frontier
they
were
a
splendid
set
of
men
these
southwesterners
tall
and
sinewy
with
resolute
faces
and
eyes
that
looked
a
man
straight
in
the
face
without
flinching
they
included
in
their
ranks
men
of
every
occupation
but
the
three
types
were
those
of
the
cowboy
the
hunter
and
the
mining
prospector
the
man
who
wandered
hither
and
thither
killing
game
for
a
living
and
spending
his
life
in
the
quest
for
metal
wealth
in
all
the
world
there
could
be
no
better
material
for
soldiers
than
that
afforded
by
these
grim
hunters
of
the
mountains
these
wild
rough
riders
of
the
plains
they
were
accustomed
to
handling
wild
and
savage
horses
they
were
accustomed
to
following
the
chase
with
the
rifle
both
for
sport
and
as
a
means
of
livelihood
varied
though
their
occupations
had
been
almost
all
had
at
one
time
or
another
herded
cattle
and
hunted
big
game
they
were
hardened
to
life
in
the
open
and
to
shifting
for
themselves
under
adverse
circumstances
they
were
used
for
all
their
lawless
freedom
to
the
rough
discipline
of
the
and
the
mining
company
some
of
them
came
from
the
small
frontier
towns
but
most
were
from
the
wilderness
having
left
their
lonely
hunters
cabins
and
shifting
to
seek
new
and
more
stirring
adventures
beyond
the
sea
they
had
their
natural
leaders
the
men
who
had
shown
they
could
master
other
men
and
could
more
than
hold
their
own
in
the
eager
driving
life
of
the
new
settlements
the
captains
and
lieutenants
were
sometimes
men
who
had
campaigned
in
the
regular
army
against
apache
ute
and
cheyenne
and
who
on
completing
their
term
of
service
had
shown
their
energy
by
settling
in
the
new
communities
and
growing
up
to
be
men
of
mark
in
other
cases
they
were
sheriffs
marshals
and
men
who
had
fought
indians
and
still
more
often
had
waged
relentless
war
upon
the
bands
of
white
desperadoes
there
was
bucky
of
arizona
captain
of
troop
a
the
mayor
of
prescott
a
famous
sheriff
throughout
the
west
for
his
feats
of
victorious
warfare
against
the
apache
no
less
than
against
the
white
and
his
father
had
fought
in
meagher
brigade
in
the
civil
war
and
he
was
himself
a
born
soldier
a
born
leader
of
men
he
was
a
wild
reckless
fellow
soft
spoken
and
of
dauntless
courage
and
boundless
ambition
he
was
staunchly
loyal
to
his
friends
and
cared
for
his
men
in
every
way
there
was
captain
llewellen
of
new
mexico
a
good
citizen
a
political
leader
and
one
of
the
most
noted
of
the
country
he
had
been
shot
four
times
in
pitched
fights
with
red
marauders
and
white
outlaws
there
was
lieutenant
ballard
who
had
broken
up
the
black
jack
gang
of
notoriety
and
his
captain
curry
another
new
mexican
sheriff
of
fame
the
officers
from
the
indian
territory
had
almost
all
served
as
marshals
and
and
in
the
indian
territory
service
as
a
meant
capacity
to
fight
battles
with
the
gangs
of
outlaws
three
of
our
higher
officers
had
been
in
the
regular
army
one
was
major
alexander
brodie
from
arizona
afterward
who
had
lived
for
twenty
years
in
the
territory
and
had
become
a
thorough
westerner
without
sinking
the
west
pointer
a
soldier
by
taste
as
well
as
training
whose
men
worshipped
him
and
would
follow
him
anywhere
as
they
would
bucky
or
any
other
of
their
favorites
brodie
was
running
a
big
mining
business
but
when
the
maine
was
blown
up
he
abandoned
everything
and
telegraphed
right
and
left
to
bid
his
friends
get
ready
for
the
fight
he
saw
impending
then
there
was
micah
jenkins
the
captain
of
troop
k
a
gentle
and
courteous
south
carolinian
on
whom
danger
acted
like
wine
in
action
he
was
a
perfect
and
he
won
his
majority
for
gallantry
in
battle
finally
there
was
allyn
capron
who
was
on
the
whole
the
best
soldier
in
the
regiment
in
fact
i
think
he
was
the
ideal
of
what
an
american
regular
army
officer
should
be
he
was
the
fifth
in
descent
from
father
to
son
who
had
served
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
in
body
and
mind
alike
he
was
fitted
to
play
his
part
to
perfection
tall
and
lithe
a
remarkable
boxer
and
walker
a
rider
and
shot
with
yellow
hair
and
piercing
blue
eyes
he
looked
what
he
was
the
archetype
of
the
fighting
man
he
had
under
him
one
of
the
two
companies
from
the
indian
territory
and
he
so
soon
impressed
himself
upon
the
wild
spirit
of
his
followers
that
he
got
them
ahead
in
discipline
faster
than
any
other
troop
in
the
regiment
while
at
the
same
time
taking
care
of
their
bodily
wants
his
ceaseless
effort
was
so
to
train
them
care
for
them
and
inspire
them
as
to
bring
their
fighting
efficiency
to
the
highest
possible
pitch
he
required
instant
obedience
and
tolerated
not
the
slightest
evasion
of
duty
but
his
mastery
of
his
art
was
so
thorough
and
his
performance
of
his
own
duty
so
rigid
that
he
won
at
once
not
merely
their
admiration
but
that
soldierly
affection
so
readily
given
by
the
man
in
the
ranks
to
the
superior
who
cares
for
his
men
and
leads
them
fearlessly
in
battle
all
easterners
and
westerners
northerners
and
southerners
officers
and
men
cowboys
and
college
graduates
wherever
they
came
from
and
whatever
their
social
position
possessed
in
common
the
traits
of
hardihood
and
a
thirst
for
adventure
they
were
to
a
man
born
adventurers
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
the
men
in
the
ranks
were
mostly
young
yet
some
were
past
their
first
youth
these
had
taken
part
in
the
killing
of
the
great
buffalo
herds
and
had
fought
indians
when
the
tribes
were
still
on
the
the
younger
ones
too
had
led
rough
lives
and
the
lines
in
their
faces
told
of
many
a
hardship
endured
and
many
a
danger
silently
faced
with
grim
unconscious
philosophy
some
were
originally
from
the
east
and
had
seen
strange
adventures
in
different
kinds
of
life
from
sailing
round
the
horn
to
mining
in
alaska
others
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
west
and
had
never
seen
a
larger
town
than
santa
fe
or
a
bigger
body
of
water
than
the
pecos
in
flood
some
of
them
went
by
their
own
name
some
had
changed
their
names
and
yet
others
possessed
but
half
a
name
colored
by
some
adjective
like
cherokee
bill
happy
jack
of
arizona
smoky
moore
the
so
named
because
cowboys
often
call
vicious
horses
smoky
horses
and
rattlesnake
pete
who
had
lived
among
the
moquis
and
taken
part
in
the
some
were
professional
gamblers
and
on
the
other
hand
no
less
than
four
were
or
had
been
baptist
or
methodist
clergymen
and
proved
fighters
too
by
the
way
some
were
men
whose
lives
in
the
past
had
not
been
free
from
the
taint
of
those
fierce
kinds
of
crime
into
which
the
lawless
spirits
who
dwell
on
the
between
civilization
and
savagery
so
readily
drift
a
far
larger
number
had
served
at
different
times
in
those
bodies
of
armed
men
with
which
the
growing
civilization
of
the
border
finally
puts
down
its
savagery
there
was
one
characteristic
and
distinctive
contingent
which
could
have
appeared
only
in
such
a
regiment
as
ours
from
the
indian
territory
there
came
a
number
of
indians
cherokees
chickasaws
choctaws
and
creeks
only
a
few
were
of
pure
blood
the
others
shaded
off
until
they
were
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
their
white
comrades
with
whom
it
may
be
mentioned
they
all
lived
on
terms
of
complete
equality
not
all
of
the
indians
were
from
the
indian
territory
one
of
the
gamest
fighters
and
best
soldiers
in
the
regiment
was
pollock
a
pawnee
he
had
been
educated
like
most
of
the
other
indians
at
one
of
those
admirable
indian
schools
which
have
added
so
much
to
the
total
of
the
small
credit
account
with
which
the
white
race
balances
the
very
unpleasant
debit
account
of
its
dealings
with
the
red
pollock
was
a
silent
solitary
fellow
an
excellent
penman
much
given
to
drawing
pictures
when
we
got
down
to
santiago
he
developed
into
the
regimental
clerk
i
never
suspected
him
of
having
a
sense
of
humor
until
one
day
at
the
end
of
our
stay
in
cuba
as
he
was
sitting
in
the
adjutant
tent
working
over
the
returns
there
turned
up
a
trooper
of
the
first
who
had
been
acting
as
barber
eyeing
him
with
immovable
face
pollock
asked
in
a
guttural
voice
do
you
cut
hair
the
man
answered
yes
and
pollock
continued
then
better
cut
mine
muttering
in
an
explanatory
soliloquy
do
want
to
wear
my
hair
long
like
a
wild
indian
when
i
in
civilized
warfare
another
indian
came
from
texas
he
was
a
brakeman
on
the
southern
pacific
and
wrote
telling
me
he
was
an
american
indian
and
that
he
wanted
to
enlist
his
name
was
colbert
which
at
once
attracted
my
attention
for
i
was
familiar
with
the
history
of
the
cherokees
and
chickasaws
during
the
eighteenth
century
when
they
lived
east
of
the
mississippi
early
in
that
century
various
traders
chiefly
scotchmen
settled
among
them
and
the
descendants
of
one
named
colbert
became
the
most
noted
chiefs
of
the
chickasaws
i
summoned
the
applicant
before
me
and
found
that
he
was
an
excellent
man
and
as
i
had
supposed
a
descendant
of
the
old
chickasaw
chiefs
he
brought
into
the
regiment
by
the
way
his
partner
a
white
man
the
two
had
been
inseparable
companions
for
some
years
and
continued
so
in
the
regiment
every
man
who
has
lived
in
the
west
knows
that
vindictive
though
the
hatred
between
the
white
man
and
the
indian
is
when
they
stand
against
one
another
in
what
may
be
called
their
tribal
relations
yet
that
men
of
indian
blood
when
adopted
into
white
communities
are
usually
treated
precisely
like
anyone
else
colbert
was
not
the
only
indian
whose
name
i
recognized
there
was
a
cherokee
named
adair
who
upon
inquiry
i
found
to
be
descended
from
the
man
who
a
century
and
a
half
ago
wrote
a
ponderous
folio
to
this
day
of
great
interest
about
the
cherokees
with
whom
he
had
spent
the
best
years
of
his
life
as
a
trader
and
agent
i
do
know
that
i
ever
came
across
a
man
with
a
really
sweeter
nature
than
another
cherokee
named
holderman
he
was
an
excellent
soldier
and
for
a
long
time
acted
as
cook
for
the
mess
he
was
a
and
came
of
a
soldier
stock
on
both
sides
and
through
both
races
he
explained
to
me
once
why
he
had
come
to
the
war
that
it
was
because
his
people
always
had
fought
when
there
was
a
war
and
he
could
not
feel
happy
to
stay
at
home
when
the
flag
was
going
into
battle
two
of
the
young
cherokee
recruits
came
to
me
with
a
most
kindly
letter
from
one
of
the
ladies
who
had
been
teaching
in
the
academy
from
which
they
were
about
to
graduate
she
and
i
had
known
one
another
in
connection
with
governmental
and
philanthropic
work
on
the
reservations
and
she
wrote
to
commend
the
two
boys
to
my
attention
one
was
on
the
academy
team
and
the
other
in
the
both
were
fine
young
fellows
the
player
now
lies
buried
with
the
other
dead
who
fell
in
the
fight
at
san
juan
the
singer
was
brought
to
death
door
by
fever
but
recovered
and
came
back
to
his
home
there
were
other
indians
of
much
wilder
type
but
their
wildness
was
precisely
like
that
of
the
cowboys
with
whom
they
were
associated
one
or
two
of
them
needed
rough
discipline
and
they
got
it
too
like
the
rest
of
the
regiment
they
were
splendid
riders
i
remember
one
man
whose
character
left
much
to
be
desired
in
some
respects
but
whose
horsemanship
was
unexceptionable
he
was
mounted
on
an
exceedingly
bad
bronco
which
would
bolt
out
of
the
ranks
at
drill
he
broke
it
of
this
habit
by
the
simple
expedient
of
giving
it
two
tremendous
twists
first
to
one
side
and
then
to
the
other
as
it
bolted
with
the
result
that
invariably
at
the
second
bound
its
legs
crossed
and
over
it
went
with
a
smash
the
rider
taking
the
somersault
with
unmoved
equanimity
the
life
histories
of
some
of
the
men
who
joined
our
regiment
would
make
many
volumes
of
thrilling
adventure
we
drew
a
great
many
recruits
from
texas
and
from
nowhere
did
we
get
a
higher
average
for
many
of
them
had
served
in
that
famous
body
of
frontier
fighters
the
texas
rangers
of
course
these
rangers
needed
no
teaching
they
were
already
trained
to
obey
and
to
take
responsibility
they
were
splendid
shots
horsemen
and
trailers
they
were
accustomed
to
living
in
the
open
to
enduring
great
fatigue
and
hardship
and
to
encountering
all
kinds
of
danger
many
of
the
arizona
and
new
mexico
men
had
taken
part
in
warfare
with
the
apaches
those
terrible
indians
of
the
waterless
southwestern
mountains
the
most
bloodthirsty
and
the
wildest
of
all
the
red
men
of
america
and
the
most
formidable
in
their
own
dreadful
style
of
warfare
of
course
a
man
who
had
kept
his
nerve
and
held
his
own
year
after
year
while
living
where
each
day
and
night
contained
the
threat
of
hidden
death
from
a
foe
whose
goings
and
comings
were
unseen
was
not
apt
to
lose
courage
when
confronted
with
any
other
enemy
an
experience
in
following
in
the
trail
of
an
enemy
who
might
flee
at
one
stretch
through
fifty
miles
of
desert
was
a
good
school
out
of
which
to
come
with
profound
indifference
for
the
ordinary
hardships
of
campaigning
as
a
rule
the
men
were
more
apt
however
to
have
had
experience
in
warring
against
white
desperadoes
and
than
against
indians
some
of
our
best
recruits
came
from
colorado
one
a
very
large
man
benjamin
franklin
daniels
had
been
marshal
of
dodge
city
when
that
pleasing
town
was
probably
the
toughest
abode
of
civilized
man
to
be
found
anywhere
on
the
continent
in
the
course
of
the
exercise
of
his
rather
lurid
functions
as
he
had
lost
half
of
one
ear
bitten
off
it
was
explained
to
me
naturally
he
viewed
the
dangers
of
battle
with
philosophic
calm
such
a
man
was
in
reality
a
veteran
even
in
his
first
fight
and
was
a
tower
of
strength
to
the
recruits
in
his
part
of
the
line
with
him
there
came
into
the
regiment
a
from
cripple
creek
named
sherman
bell
bell
had
a
hernia
but
he
was
so
excellent
a
man
that
we
decided
to
take
him
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
greater
resolution
than
bell
displayed
throughout
the
campaign
in
cuba
the
great
exertions
which
he
was
forced
to
make
again
and
again
opened
the
hernia
and
the
surgeons
insisted
that
he
must
return
to
the
united
states
but
he
simply
would
not
go
then
there
was
little
mcginty
the
from
oklahoma
who
never
had
walked
a
hundred
yards
if
by
any
possibility
he
could
ride
when
mcginty
was
reproved
for
his
absolute
inability
to
keep
step
on
the
he
responded
that
he
was
pretty
sure
he
could
keep
step
on
horseback
mcginty
short
legs
caused
him
much
trouble
on
the
marches
but
we
had
no
braver
or
better
man
in
the
fights
one
old
friend
of
mine
had
come
from
far
northern
idaho
to
join
the
regiment
at
san
antonio
he
was
a
hunter
named
fred
herrig
an
alsatian
by
birth
a
dozen
years
before
he
and
i
had
hunted
mountain
sheep
and
deer
when
laying
in
the
winter
stock
of
meat
for
my
ranch
on
the
little
missouri
sometimes
in
the
bright
fall
weather
sometimes
in
the
arctic
bitterness
of
the
early
northern
winter
he
was
the
most
loyal
and
of
men
and
he
had
come
to
join
his
old
boss
and
comrade
in
the
bigger
hunting
which
we
were
to
carry
on
through
the
tropic
midsummer
the
temptation
is
great
to
go
on
enumerating
man
after
man
who
stood
whether
as
a
killer
of
game
a
tamer
of
horses
or
a
queller
of
disorder
among
his
people
or
who
mayhap
stood
out
with
a
more
evil
prominence
as
himself
a
dangerous
man
one
given
to
the
taking
of
life
on
small
provocation
or
one
who
was
ready
to
earn
his
living
outside
the
law
if
the
occasion
demanded
it
there
was
tall
proffit
the
from
north
carolina
sinewy
saturnine
fearless
smith
the
from
wyoming
and
mccann
the
arizona
who
had
begun
life
as
a
there
was
crockett
the
georgian
who
had
been
an
internal
revenue
officer
and
had
waged
perilous
war
on
the
moonshiners
there
were
darnell
and
wood
of
new
mexico
who
could
literally
ride
any
horses
alive
there
were
goodwin
and
buck
taylor
and
armstrong
the
ranger
crack
shots
with
rifle
or
revolver
there
was
many
a
skilled
packer
who
had
led
and
guarded
his
trains
of
laden
mules
through
the
country
surrounding
some
of
civilization
there
were
men
who
had
won
fame
as
rocky
mountain
or
who
had
spent
endless
days
in
guiding
the
slow
across
the
grassy
plains
there
were
miners
who
knew
every
camp
from
the
yukon
to
leadville
and
in
whose
memories
were
stored
the
brands
carried
by
the
herds
from
chihuahua
to
assiniboia
there
were
men
who
had
roped
wild
steers
in
the
mesquite
brush
of
the
nueces
and
who
year
in
and
year
out
had
driven
the
trail
herds
northward
over
desolate
wastes
and
across
the
fords
of
shrunken
rivers
to
the
fattening
grounds
of
the
powder
and
the
yellowstone
they
were
hardened
to
the
scorching
heat
and
bitter
cold
of
the
dry
plains
and
mountains
they
were
accustomed
to
sleep
in
the
open
while
the
picketed
horses
grazed
beside
them
near
some
shallow
reedy
pool
they
had
wandered
hither
and
thither
across
the
vast
desolation
of
the
wilderness
alone
or
with
comrades
they
had
cowered
in
the
shelter
of
cut
banks
from
the
icy
blast
of
the
norther
and
far
out
on
the
midsummer
prairies
they
had
known
the
luxury
of
lying
in
the
shade
of
the
wagon
during
the
noonday
rest
they
had
lived
in
brush
for
weeks
at
a
time
or
with
only
the
as
an
occasional
house
they
had
fared
hard
when
exploring
the
unknown
they
had
fared
well
on
the
and
they
had
known
the
plenty
of
the
log
where
the
tables
were
spread
with
smoked
venison
and
and
milk
and
bread
and
vegetables
from
the
such
were
the
men
we
had
as
recruits
soldiers
ready
made
as
far
as
concerned
their
capacity
as
individual
fighters
what
was
necessary
was
to
teach
them
to
act
together
and
to
obey
orders
our
special
task
was
to
make
them
ready
for
action
in
the
shortest
possible
time
we
were
bound
to
see
fighting
and
therefore
to
be
with
the
first
expedition
that
left
the
united
states
for
we
could
not
tell
how
long
the
war
would
last
i
had
been
quite
prepared
for
trouble
when
it
came
to
enforcing
discipline
but
i
was
agreeably
disappointed
there
were
plenty
of
hard
characters
who
might
by
themselves
have
given
trouble
and
with
one
or
two
of
whom
we
did
have
to
take
rough
measures
but
the
bulk
of
the
men
thoroughly
understood
that
without
discipline
they
would
be
merely
a
valueless
mob
and
they
set
themselves
hard
at
work
to
learn
the
new
duties
of
course
such
a
regiment
in
spite
of
or
indeed
i
might
almost
say
because
of
the
characteristics
which
made
the
individual
men
so
exceptionally
formidable
as
soldiers
could
very
readily
have
been
spoiled
any
weakness
in
the
commander
would
have
ruined
it
on
the
other
hand
to
treat
it
from
the
of
the
martinet
and
military
pedant
would
have
been
almost
equally
fatal
from
the
beginning
we
started
out
to
secure
the
essentials
of
discipline
while
laying
just
as
little
stress
as
possible
on
the
the
men
were
singularly
quick
to
respond
to
any
appeal
to
their
intelligence
and
patriotism
the
faults
they
committed
were
those
of
ignorance
merely
when
holderman
in
announcing
dinner
to
the
colonel
and
the
three
majors
genially
remarked
if
you
fellars
come
soon
everything
get
cold
he
had
no
thought
of
other
than
a
kindly
and
respectful
regard
for
their
welfare
and
was
glad
to
modify
his
form
of
address
on
being
told
that
it
was
not
what
could
be
described
as
conventionally
military
when
one
of
our
sentinels
who
had
with
much
labor
learned
the
manual
of
arms
saluted
with
great
pride
as
i
passed
and
added
with
a
friendly
nod
colonel
this
variation
in
the
accepted
formula
on
such
occasions
was
meant
and
was
accepted
as
mere
friendly
interest
in
both
cases
the
needed
instruction
was
given
and
received
in
the
same
kindly
spirit
one
of
the
new
indian
territory
recruits
after
stay
in
camp
during
which
he
had
held
himself
distinctly
aloof
from
the
general
interests
called
on
the
colonel
in
his
tent
and
remarked
well
colonel
i
want
to
shake
hands
and
say
we
with
you
we
did
know
how
we
would
like
you
fellars
at
first
but
all
right
and
you
know
your
business
and
you
mean
business
and
you
can
count
on
us
every
time
that
same
night
which
was
hot
mosquitoes
were
very
annoying
and
shortly
after
midnight
both
the
colonel
and
i
came
to
the
doors
of
our
respective
tents
which
adjoined
one
another
the
sentinel
in
front
was
also
fighting
mosquitoes
as
we
came
out
we
saw
him
pitch
his
gun
about
ten
feet
off
and
sit
down
to
attack
some
of
the
pests
that
had
swarmed
up
his
trousers
legs
happening
to
glance
in
our
direction
he
nodded
pleasantly
and
with
unabashed
and
friendly
feeling
remarked
ai
they
bad
it
was
astonishing
how
soon
the
men
got
over
these
little
peculiarities
they
speedily
grew
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
observance
of
certain
forms
was
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
proper
discipline
they
became
scrupulously
careful
in
touching
their
hats
and
always
came
to
attention
when
spoken
to
they
saw
that
we
did
not
insist
upon
the
observance
of
these
forms
to
humiliate
them
that
we
were
as
anxious
to
learn
our
own
duties
as
we
were
to
have
them
learn
theirs
and
as
scrupulous
in
paying
respect
to
our
superiors
as
we
were
in
exacting
the
acknowledgment
due
our
rank
from
those
below
us
moreover
what
was
very
important
they
saw
that
we
were
careful
to
look
after
their
interests
in
every
way
and
were
doing
all
that
was
possible
to
hurry
up
the
equipment
and
drill
of
the
regiment
so
as
to
get
into
the
war
rigid
guard
duty
was
established
at
once
and
everyone
was
impressed
with
the
necessity
for
vigilance
and
watchfulness
the
policing
of
the
camp
was
likewise
attended
to
with
the
utmost
rigor
as
always
with
new
troops
they
were
at
first
indifferent
to
the
necessity
for
cleanliness
in
camp
arrangements
but
on
this
point
colonel
wood
brooked
no
laxity
and
in
a
very
little
while
the
hygienic
conditions
of
the
camp
were
as
good
as
those
of
any
regular
regiment
meanwhile
the
men
were
being
drilled
on
foot
at
first
with
the
utmost
assiduity
every
night
we
had
officers
school
the
officers
of
each
troop
being
given
similar
schooling
by
the
captain
or
one
of
the
lieutenants
of
the
troop
and
every
day
we
practised
hard
by
squad
by
troop
by
squadron
and
battalion
the
earnestness
and
intelligence
with
which
the
men
went
to
work
rendered
the
task
of
instruction
much
less
difficult
than
would
be
supposed
it
soon
grew
easy
to
handle
the
regiment
in
all
the
simpler
forms
of
close
and
open
order
when
they
had
grown
so
that
they
could
be
handled
with
ease
in
marching
and
in
the
ordinary
manoeuvres
of
the
we
began
to
train
them
in
work
skirmishing
and
firing
here
their
woodcraft
and
plainscraft
their
knowledge
of
the
rifle
helped
us
very
much
skirmishing
they
took
to
naturally
which
was
fortunate
as
practically
all
our
fighting
was
done
in
open
order
meanwhile
we
were
purchasing
horses
judging
from
what
i
saw
i
do
not
think
that
we
got
heavy
enough
animals
and
of
those
purchased
certainly
a
half
were
nearly
unbroken
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
handle
them
on
the
and
to
provide
for
feeding
and
watering
and
the
efforts
to
shoe
and
ride
them
were
at
first
productive
of
much
vigorous
excitement
of
course
those
that
were
wild
from
the
range
had
to
be
thrown
and
tied
down
before
they
could
be
shod
half
the
horses
of
the
regiment
bucked
or
possessed
some
other
of
the
amiable
weaknesses
incident
to
horse
life
on
the
great
ranches
but
we
had
abundance
of
men
who
were
utterly
unmoved
by
any
antic
a
horse
might
commit
every
animal
was
speedily
mastered
though
a
large
number
remained
to
the
end
mounts
upon
which
an
ordinary
rider
would
have
felt
very
uncomfortable
my
own
horses
were
purchased
for
me
by
a
texas
friend
john
moore
with
whom
i
had
once
hunted
peccaries
on
the
nueces
i
only
paid
fifty
dollars
apiece
and
the
animals
were
not
showy
but
they
were
tough
and
hardy
and
answered
my
purpose
well
mounted
drill
with
such
horses
and
men
bade
fair
to
offer
opportunities
for
excitement
yet
it
usually
went
off
smoothly
enough
before
drilling
the
men
on
horseback
they
had
all
been
drilled
on
foot
and
having
gone
at
their
work
with
hearty
zest
they
knew
well
the
simple
movements
to
form
any
kind
of
line
or
column
wood
was
busy
from
morning
till
night
in
hurrying
the
final
details
of
the
equipment
and
he
turned
the
drill
of
the
men
over
to
me
to
drill
perfectly
needs
long
practice
but
to
drill
roughly
is
a
thing
very
easy
to
learn
indeed
we
were
not
always
right
about
our
intervals
our
lines
were
somewhat
irregular
and
our
more
difficult
movements
were
executed
at
times
in
rather
a
haphazard
way
but
the
essential
commands
and
the
essential
movements
we
learned
without
any
difficulty
and
the
men
performed
them
with
great
dash
when
we
put
them
on
horseback
there
was
of
course
trouble
with
the
horses
but
the
horsemanship
of
the
riders
was
consummate
in
fact
the
men
were
immensely
interested
in
making
their
horses
perform
each
evolution
with
the
utmost
speed
and
accuracy
and
in
forcing
each
unquiet
vicious
brute
to
get
into
line
and
stay
in
line
whether
he
would
or
not
the
held
their
plunging
steeds
true
to
the
line
no
matter
what
they
tried
to
do
and
each
wild
rider
brought
his
wild
horse
into
his
proper
place
with
a
dash
and
ease
which
showed
the
natural
cavalryman
in
short
from
the
very
beginning
the
horseback
drills
were
good
fun
and
everyone
enjoyed
them
we
marched
out
through
the
adjoining
country
to
drill
wherever
we
found
open
ground
practising
all
the
different
column
formations
as
we
went
on
the
open
ground
we
threw
out
the
line
to
one
side
or
the
other
and
in
one
position
and
the
other
sometimes
at
the
trot
sometimes
at
the
gallop
as
the
men
grew
accustomed
to
the
simple
evolutions
we
tried
them
more
and
more
in
skirmish
drills
practising
them
so
that
they
might
get
accustomed
to
advance
in
open
order
and
to
skirmish
in
any
country
while
the
horses
were
held
in
the
rear
our
arms
were
the
regular
cavalry
carbine
the
krag
a
splendid
weapon
and
the
revolver
a
few
carried
their
favorite
winchesters
using
of
course
the
new
model
which
took
the
government
cartridge
we
felt
very
strongly
that
it
would
be
worse
than
a
waste
of
time
to
try
to
train
our
men
to
use
the
sabre
a
weapon
utterly
alien
to
them
but
with
the
rifle
and
revolver
they
were
already
thoroughly
familiar
many
of
my
cavalry
friends
in
the
past
had
insisted
to
me
that
the
revolver
was
a
better
weapon
than
the
sword
among
them
basil
duke
the
noted
confederate
cavalry
leader
and
captain
frank
edwards
whom
i
had
met
when
on
the
of
the
yellowstone
and
the
snake
personally
i
knew
too
little
to
decide
as
to
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
arms
but
i
did
know
that
it
was
a
great
deal
better
to
use
the
arm
with
which
our
men
were
already
proficient
they
were
therefore
armed
with
what
might
be
called
their
natural
weapon
the
revolver
as
it
turned
out
we
were
not
used
mounted
at
all
so
that
our
preparations
on
this
point
came
to
nothing
in
a
way
i
have
always
regretted
this
we
thought
we
should
at
least
be
employed
as
cavalry
in
the
great
campaign
against
havana
in
the
fall
and
from
the
beginning
i
began
to
train
my
men
in
shock
tactics
for
use
against
hostile
cavalry
my
belief
was
that
the
horse
was
really
the
weapon
with
which
to
strike
the
first
blow
i
felt
that
if
my
men
could
be
trained
to
hit
their
adversaries
with
their
horses
it
was
a
matter
of
small
amount
whether
at
the
moment
when
the
onset
occurred
sabres
lances
or
revolvers
were
used
while
in
the
subsequent
melee
i
believed
the
revolver
would
outclass
cold
steel
as
a
weapon
but
this
is
all
guesswork
for
we
never
had
occasion
to
try
the
experiment
it
was
astonishing
what
a
difference
was
made
by
two
or
three
training
the
mere
thorough
performance
of
guard
and
police
duties
helped
the
men
very
rapidly
to
become
soldiers
the
officers
studied
hard
and
both
officers
and
men
worked
hard
in
the
it
was
of
course
rough
and
ready
drill
but
it
was
very
efficient
and
it
was
suited
to
the
men
who
made
up
the
regiment
their
uniform
also
suited
them
in
their
slouch
hats
blue
flannel
shirts
brown
trousers
leggings
and
boots
with
handkerchiefs
knotted
loosely
around
their
necks
they
looked
exactly
as
a
body
of
cowboy
cavalry
should
look
the
officers
speedily
grew
to
realize
that
they
must
not
be
with
their
men
and
yet
that
they
must
care
for
them
in
every
way
the
men
in
return
began
to
acquire
those
habits
of
attention
to
soldierly
detail
which
mean
so
much
in
making
a
regiment
above
all
every
man
felt
and
had
constantly
instilled
into
him
a
keen
pride
of
the
regiment
and
a
resolute
purpose
to
do
his
whole
duty
uncomplainingly
and
above
all
to
win
glory
by
the
way
he
handled
himself
in
battle
ii
to
cuba
up
to
the
last
moment
we
were
spending
every
ounce
of
energy
we
had
in
getting
the
regiment
into
shape
fortunately
there
were
a
good
many
vacancies
among
the
officers
as
the
original
number
of
men
was
increased
to
so
that
two
companies
were
organized
entirely
anew
this
gave
the
chance
to
promote
some
men
one
of
the
most
useful
members
of
the
regiment
was
robb
church
formerly
a
princeton
player
he
was
appointed
as
assistant
surgeon
but
acted
throughout
almost
all
the
cuban
campaign
as
the
regimental
surgeon
it
was
church
who
first
gave
me
an
idea
of
bucky
versatility
for
i
happened
to
overhear
them
discussing
aryan
together
and
then
sliding
off
into
a
review
of
the
novels
of
balzac
and
a
discussion
as
to
how
far
balzac
could
be
said
to
be
the
founder
of
the
modern
realistic
school
of
fiction
church
had
led
almost
as
varied
a
life
as
bucky
himself
his
career
including
incidents
as
far
apart
as
exploring
and
in
the
olympic
mountains
cooking
in
a
and
serving
as
doctor
on
an
emigrant
ship
woodbury
kane
was
given
a
commission
and
also
horace
devereux
of
princeton
kane
was
older
than
the
other
college
men
who
entered
in
the
ranks
and
as
he
had
the
same
good
qualities
to
start
with
this
resulted
in
his
ultimately
becoming
perhaps
the
most
useful
soldier
in
the
regiment
he
escaped
wounds
and
serious
sickness
and
was
able
to
serve
through
every
day
of
the
regiment
existence
two
of
the
men
made
second
lieutenants
by
promotion
from
the
ranks
while
in
san
antonio
were
john
greenway
a
noted
yale
player
and
catcher
on
her
nine
and
david
goodrich
for
two
years
captain
of
the
harvard
crew
they
were
young
men
goodrich
having
only
just
graduated
while
greenway
whose
father
had
served
with
honor
in
the
confederate
army
had
been
out
of
yale
three
or
four
years
they
were
natural
soldiers
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
overestimate
the
amount
of
good
they
did
the
regiment
they
were
strapping
fellows
entirely
fearless
modest
and
quiet
their
only
thought
was
how
to
perfect
themselves
in
their
own
duties
and
how
to
take
care
of
the
men
under
them
so
as
to
bring
them
to
the
highest
point
of
soldierly
perfection
i
grew
steadily
to
rely
upon
them
as
men
who
could
be
counted
upon
with
absolute
certainty
not
only
in
every
emergency
but
in
all
routine
work
they
were
never
so
tired
as
not
to
respond
with
eagerness
to
the
slightest
suggestion
of
doing
something
new
whether
it
was
dangerous
or
merely
difficult
and
laborious
they
not
merely
did
their
duty
but
were
always
on
the
watch
to
find
out
some
new
duty
which
they
could
construe
to
be
theirs
whether
it
was
policing
camp
or
keeping
guard
or
preventing
straggling
on
the
march
or
procuring
food
for
the
men
or
seeing
that
they
took
care
of
themselves
in
camp
or
performing
some
feat
of
unusual
hazard
in
the
fight
no
call
was
ever
made
upon
them
to
which
they
did
not
respond
with
eager
thankfulness
for
being
given
the
chance
to
answer
it
later
on
i
worked
them
as
hard
as
i
knew
how
and
the
regiment
will
always
be
their
debtor
greenway
was
from
arkansas
we
could
have
filled
up
the
whole
regiment
many
times
over
from
the
south
atlantic
and
gulf
states
alone
but
were
only
able
to
accept
a
very
few
applicants
one
of
them
was
john
mcilhenny
of
louisiana
a
planter
and
manufacturer
a
hunter
and
who
could
have
had
a
commission
in
the
louisiana
troops
but
who
preferred
to
go
as
a
trooper
in
the
rough
riders
because
he
believed
we
would
surely
see
fighting
he
could
have
commanded
any
influence
social
or
political
he
wished
but
he
never
asked
a
favor
of
any
kind
he
went
into
one
of
the
new
mexican
troops
and
by
his
high
qualities
and
zealous
attention
to
duty
speedily
rose
to
a
sergeantcy
and
finally
won
his
lieutenancy
for
gallantry
in
action
the
tone
of
the
officers
mess
was
very
high
everyone
seemed
to
realize
that
he
had
undertaken
most
serious
work
they
all
earnestly
wished
for
a
chance
to
distinguish
themselves
and
fully
appreciated
that
they
ran
the
risk
not
merely
of
death
but
of
what
was
infinitely
worse
namely
failure
at
the
crisis
to
perform
duty
well
and
they
strove
earnestly
so
to
train
themselves
and
the
men
under
them
as
to
minimize
the
possibility
of
such
disgrace
every
officer
and
every
man
was
taught
continually
to
look
forward
to
the
day
of
battle
eagerly
but
with
an
entire
sense
of
the
drain
that
would
then
be
made
upon
his
endurance
and
resolution
they
were
also
taught
that
before
the
battle
came
the
rigorous
performance
of
the
countless
irksome
duties
of
the
camp
and
the
march
was
demanded
from
all
alike
and
that
no
excuse
would
be
tolerated
for
failure
to
perform
duty
very
few
of
the
men
had
gone
into
the
regiment
lightly
and
the
fact
that
they
did
their
duty
so
well
may
be
largely
attributed
to
the
seriousness
with
which
these
eager
adventurous
young
fellows
approached
their
work
this
seriousness
and
a
certain
simple
manliness
which
accompanied
it
had
one
very
pleasant
side
during
our
entire
time
of
service
i
never
heard
in
the
officers
mess
a
foul
story
or
a
foul
word
and
though
there
was
occasional
hard
swearing
in
moments
of
emergency
yet
even
this
was
the
exception
the
regiment
attracted
adventurous
spirits
from
everywhere
our
chief
trumpeter
was
a
native
american
our
second
trumpeter
was
from
the
mediterranean
i
think
an
italian
who
had
been
a
soldier
of
fortune
not
only
in
egypt
but
in
the
french
army
in
southern
china
two
excellent
men
were
osborne
a
tall
australian
who
had
been
an
officer
in
the
new
south
wales
mounted
rifles
and
cook
an
englishman
who
had
served
in
south
africa
both
when
the
regiment
disbanded
were
plaintive
in
expressing
their
fond
regret
that
it
could
not
be
used
against
the
transvaal
boers
one
of
our
best
soldiers
was
a
man
whose
real
and
assumed
names
i
for
obvious
reasons
conceal
he
usually
went
by
a
nickname
which
i
will
call
tennessee
he
was
a
tall
gaunt
fellow
with
a
quiet
and
distinctly
sinister
eye
who
did
his
duty
excellently
especially
when
a
fight
was
on
and
who
being
an
expert
gambler
always
contrived
to
reap
a
rich
harvest
after
when
the
regiment
was
mustered
out
he
asked
me
to
put
a
brief
memorandum
of
his
services
on
his
discharge
certificate
which
i
gladly
did
he
much
appreciated
this
and
added
in
explanation
you
see
colonel
my
real
name
is
smith
yancy
i
had
to
change
it
because
three
or
four
years
ago
i
had
a
little
trouble
with
a
gentleman
and
er
well
in
fact
i
had
to
kill
him
and
the
district
attorney
he
had
it
in
for
me
and
so
i
just
skipped
the
country
and
now
if
it
ever
should
be
brought
up
against
me
i
should
like
to
show
your
certificate
as
to
my
character
the
course
of
frontier
justice
sometimes
moves
in
unexpected
zigzags
so
i
did
not
express
the
doubt
i
felt
as
to
whether
my
certificate
that
he
had
been
a
good
soldier
would
help
him
much
if
he
was
tried
for
a
murder
committed
three
or
four
years
previously
the
men
worked
hard
and
faithfully
as
a
rule
in
spite
of
the
number
of
rough
characters
among
them
they
behaved
very
well
one
night
a
few
of
them
went
on
a
spree
and
proceeded
to
paint
san
antonio
red
one
was
captured
by
the
city
authorities
and
we
had
to
leave
him
behind
us
in
jail
the
others
we
dealt
with
ourselves
in
a
way
that
prevented
a
repetition
of
the
occurrence
the
men
speedily
gave
one
another
nicknames
largely
conferred
in
a
spirit
of
derision
their
basis
lying
in
contrast
a
brave
but
fastidious
member
of
a
eastern
club
who
was
serving
in
the
ranks
was
christened
tough
ike
and
his
bunkie
the
man
who
shared
his
who
was
a
decidedly
rough
gradually
acquired
the
name
of
the
dude
one
unlucky
and
who
had
never
been
east
of
the
great
plains
in
his
life
unwarily
boasted
that
he
had
an
aunt
in
new
york
and
ever
afterward
went
by
the
name
of
metropolitan
bill
a
huge
irishman
was
named
sheeny
solomon
a
young
jew
who
developed
into
one
of
the
best
fighters
in
the
regiment
accepted
with
entire
equanimity
the
name
of
we
had
quite
a
number
of
professional
gamblers
who
i
am
bound
to
say
usually
made
good
soldiers
one
who
was
almost
abnormally
quiet
and
gentle
was
called
hell
roarer
while
another
who
in
point
of
language
and
deportment
was
his
exact
antithesis
was
christened
prayerful
james
while
the
officers
and
men
were
learning
their
duties
and
learning
to
know
one
another
colonel
wood
was
straining
every
nerve
to
get
our
equipments
an
effort
which
was
complicated
by
the
tendency
of
the
ordnance
bureau
to
send
whatever
we
really
needed
by
freight
instead
of
express
finally
just
as
the
last
rifles
revolvers
and
saddles
came
we
were
ordered
by
wire
at
once
to
proceed
by
train
to
tampa
instantly
all
was
joyful
excitement
we
had
enjoyed
san
antonio
and
were
glad
that
our
regiment
had
been
organized
in
the
city
where
the
alamo
commemorates
the
death
fight
of
crockett
bowie
and
their
famous
band
of
frontier
heroes
all
of
us
had
worked
hard
so
that
we
had
had
no
time
to
be
homesick
or
downcast
but
we
were
glad
to
leave
the
hot
camp
where
every
day
the
strong
wind
sifted
the
dust
through
everything
and
to
start
for
the
of
the
army
which
was
to
invade
cuba
our
horses
and
men
were
getting
into
good
shape
we
were
well
enough
equipped
to
warrant
our
starting
on
the
campaign
and
every
man
was
filled
with
dread
of
being
out
of
the
fighting
we
had
a
of
mules
so
we
had
close
on
to
animals
to
carry
of
course
our
train
was
split
up
into
sections
seven
all
told
colonel
wood
commanding
the
first
three
and
i
the
last
four
the
journey
by
rail
from
san
antonio
to
tampa
took
just
four
days
and
i
doubt
if
anybody
who
was
on
the
trip
will
soon
forget
it
to
occupy
my
few
spare
moments
i
was
reading
demolins
superiorite
des
demolins
in
giving
the
reasons
why
the
peoples
are
superior
to
those
of
continental
europe
lays
much
stress
upon
the
way
in
which
militarism
deadens
the
power
of
individual
initiative
the
soldier
being
trained
to
complete
suppression
of
individual
will
while
his
faculties
become
atrophied
in
consequence
of
his
being
merely
a
cog
in
a
vast
and
perfectly
ordered
machine
i
can
assure
the
excellent
french
publicist
that
american
militarism
at
least
of
the
volunteer
sort
has
points
of
difference
from
the
militarism
of
continental
europe
the
battalion
chief
of
a
newly
raised
american
regiment
when
striving
to
get
into
a
war
which
the
american
people
have
undertaken
with
buoyant
and
indifference
to
detail
has
positively
unlimited
opportunity
for
the
display
of
individual
initiative
and
is
in
no
danger
whatever
either
of
suffering
from
unhealthy
suppression
of
personal
will
or
of
finding
his
faculties
of
numbed
by
becoming
a
cog
in
a
gigantic
and
machine
if
such
a
battalion
chief
wants
to
get
anything
or
go
anywhere
he
must
do
it
by
exercising
every
pound
of
resource
inventiveness
and
audacity
he
possesses
the
help
advice
and
superintendence
he
gets
from
outside
will
be
of
the
most
general
not
to
say
superficial
character
if
he
is
a
cavalry
officer
he
has
got
to
hurry
and
push
the
purchase
of
his
horses
plunging
into
and
out
of
the
meshes
of
as
best
he
can
he
will
have
to
fight
for
his
rifles
and
his
tents
and
his
clothes
he
will
have
to
keep
his
men
healthy
largely
by
the
light
that
nature
has
given
him
when
he
wishes
to
embark
his
regiment
he
will
have
to
fight
for
his
exactly
as
he
fights
for
his
transport
when
it
comes
to
going
across
the
sea
and
on
his
journey
his
men
will
or
will
not
have
food
and
his
horses
will
or
will
not
have
water
and
hay
and
the
trains
will
or
will
not
make
connections
in
exact
correspondence
to
the
energy
and
success
of
his
own
efforts
to
keep
things
moving
straight
it
was
on
sunday
may
that
we
marched
out
of
our
hot
windy
dusty
camp
to
take
the
cars
for
tampa
colonel
wood
went
first
with
the
three
sections
under
his
special
care
i
followed
with
the
other
four
the
railway
had
promised
us
a
hours
trip
but
our
experience
in
loading
was
enough
to
show
that
the
promise
would
not
be
made
good
there
were
no
proper
facilities
for
getting
the
horses
on
or
off
the
cars
or
for
feeding
or
watering
them
and
there
was
endless
confusion
and
delay
among
the
railway
officials
i
marched
my
four
sections
over
in
the
afternoon
the
first
three
having
taken
the
entire
day
to
get
off
we
occupied
the
night
as
far
as
the
regiment
itself
was
concerned
we
worked
an
excellent
system
wood
instructing
me
exactly
how
to
proceed
so
as
to
avoid
confusion
being
a
veteran
campaigner
he
had
all
along
insisted
that
for
such
work
as
we
had
before
us
we
must
travel
with
the
minimum
possible
luggage
the
men
had
merely
what
they
could
carry
on
their
own
backs
and
the
officers
very
little
more
my
own
roll
of
clothes
and
bedding
could
be
put
on
my
spare
horse
the
was
to
be
used
simply
for
food
forage
and
spare
ammunition
as
it
turned
out
we
were
not
allowed
to
take
either
it
or
the
horses
it
was
dusk
when
i
marched
my
long
files
of
dusty
troopers
into
the
i
then
made
all
dismount
excepting
the
troop
which
i
first
intended
to
load
this
was
brought
up
to
the
first
here
every
man
unsaddled
and
left
his
saddle
bridle
and
all
that
he
did
not
himself
need
in
the
car
each
individual
property
being
corded
together
a
guard
was
left
in
the
car
and
the
rest
of
the
men
took
the
naked
horses
into
the
pens
to
be
fed
and
watered
the
other
troops
were
loaded
in
the
same
way
in
succession
with
each
section
there
were
thus
a
couple
of
in
which
the
the
superfluous
baggage
and
the
travel
rations
were
carried
and
i
also
put
aboard
not
only
at
starting
but
at
every
other
opportunity
what
oats
and
hay
i
could
get
so
as
to
provide
against
accidents
for
the
horses
by
the
time
the
were
loaded
the
horses
of
the
first
section
had
eaten
and
drunk
their
fill
and
we
loaded
them
on
the
officers
of
each
troop
saw
to
the
loading
taking
a
dozen
picked
men
to
help
them
for
some
of
the
wild
creatures
half
broken
and
fresh
from
the
ranges
were
with
difficulty
driven
up
the
chutes
meanwhile
i
superintended
not
merely
my
own
men
but
the
railroad
men
and
when
the
delays
of
the
latter
and
their
inability
to
understand
what
was
necessary
grew
past
bearing
i
took
charge
of
the
trains
myself
so
as
to
insure
the
of
each
section
being
coupled
with
the
of
that
section
we
worked
until
long
past
midnight
before
we
got
the
horses
and
baggage
aboard
and
then
found
that
for
some
reason
the
were
delayed
and
would
not
be
out
for
some
hours
in
the
confusion
and
darkness
men
of
the
different
troops
had
become
scattered
and
some
had
drifted
off
to
the
vile
around
the
so
i
sent
details
to
search
the
latter
while
the
trumpeters
blew
the
assembly
until
the
first
sergeants
could
account
for
all
the
men
then
the
troops
were
arranged
in
order
and
the
men
of
each
lay
down
where
they
were
by
the
tracks
and
in
the
brush
to
sleep
until
morning
at
dawn
the
arrived
the
senior
captain
of
each
section
saw
to
it
that
his
own
horses
troopers
and
baggage
were
together
and
one
by
one
they
started
off
i
taking
the
last
in
person
captain
capron
had
at
the
very
beginning
shown
himself
to
be
simply
invaluable
from
his
extraordinary
energy
executive
capacity
and
mastery
over
men
and
i
kept
his
section
next
mine
so
that
we
generally
came
together
at
the
different
yards
the
next
four
days
were
very
hot
and
very
dusty
i
tried
to
arrange
so
the
sections
would
be
far
enough
apart
to
allow
each
ample
time
to
unload
feed
water
and
load
the
horses
at
any
before
the
next
section
could
arrive
there
was
enough
delay
and
failure
to
make
connections
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
people
to
keep
me
entirely
busy
not
to
speak
of
seeing
at
the
that
the
inexperienced
officers
got
enough
hay
for
their
horses
and
that
the
water
given
to
them
was
both
ample
in
quantity
and
drinkable
it
happened
that
we
usually
made
our
longest
stops
at
night
and
this
meant
that
we
were
up
all
night
long
two
or
three
times
a
day
i
got
the
men
buckets
of
hot
coffee
and
when
we
made
a
long
enough
stop
they
were
allowed
liberty
under
the
supervision
of
the
officers
some
of
them
abused
the
privilege
and
started
to
get
drunk
these
were
promptly
handled
with
the
necessary
severity
in
the
interest
of
the
others
for
it
was
only
by
putting
an
immediate
check
to
every
form
of
lawlessness
or
disobedience
among
the
few
men
who
were
inclined
to
be
bad
that
we
were
enabled
to
give
full
liberty
to
those
who
would
not
abuse
it
everywhere
the
people
came
out
to
greet
us
and
cheer
us
they
brought
us
flowers
they
brought
us
watermelons
and
other
fruits
and
sometimes
jugs
and
pails
of
milk
all
of
which
we
greatly
appreciated
we
were
travelling
through
a
region
where
practically
all
the
older
men
had
served
in
the
confederate
army
and
where
the
younger
men
had
all
their
lives
long
drunk
in
the
endless
tales
told
by
their
elders
at
home
and
at
the
taverns
and
in
the
squares
about
the
cavalry
of
forrest
and
morgan
and
the
infantry
of
jackson
and
hood
the
blood
of
the
old
men
stirred
to
the
distant
breath
of
battle
the
blood
of
the
young
men
leaped
hot
with
eager
desire
to
accompany
us
the
older
women
who
remembered
the
dreadful
misery
of
war
the
misery
that
presses
its
iron
weight
most
heavily
on
the
wives
and
the
little
ones
looked
sadly
at
us
but
the
young
girls
drove
down
in
bevies
arrayed
in
their
finery
to
wave
flags
in
farewell
to
the
troopers
and
to
beg
cartridges
and
buttons
as
mementos
everywhere
we
saw
the
stars
and
stripes
and
everywhere
we
were
told
by
grizzled
that
they
had
never
dreamed
in
the
bygone
days
of
bitterness
to
greet
the
old
flag
as
they
now
were
greeting
it
and
to
send
their
sons
as
now
they
were
sending
them
to
fight
and
die
under
it
it
was
four
days
later
that
we
disembarked
in
a
perfect
welter
of
confusion
tampa
lay
in
the
at
the
end
of
a
railroad
and
everything
connected
with
both
military
and
railroad
matters
was
in
an
almost
inextricable
tangle
there
was
no
one
to
meet
us
or
to
tell
us
where
we
were
to
camp
and
no
one
to
issue
us
food
for
the
first
hours
while
the
railroad
people
unloaded
us
wherever
they
pleased
or
rather
wherever
the
jam
of
all
kinds
of
trains
rendered
it
possible
we
had
to
buy
the
men
food
out
of
our
own
pockets
and
to
seize
wagons
in
order
to
get
our
spare
baggage
taken
to
the
camping
ground
which
we
at
last
found
had
been
allotted
to
us
once
on
the
ground
we
speedily
got
order
out
of
confusion
under
wood
eye
the
tents
were
put
up
in
long
streets
the
of
each
troop
stretching
down
its
side
of
each
street
the
quarters
were
at
the
upper
ends
of
the
streets
the
company
kitchens
and
sinks
at
the
opposite
ends
the
camp
was
strictly
policed
and
drill
promptly
begun
for
hours
we
let
the
horses
rest
drilling
on
foot
and
then
began
the
mounted
drill
again
the
regiments
with
which
we
were
afterward
to
serve
were
camped
near
us
and
the
sandy
streets
of
the
little
town
were
thronged
with
soldiers
almost
all
of
them
regulars
for
there
were
but
one
or
two
volunteer
organizations
besides
ourselves
the
regulars
wore
the
canonical
dark
blue
of
uncle
sam
our
own
men
were
clad
in
dusty
brown
blouses
trousers
and
leggings
being
of
the
same
hue
while
the
soft
hat
was
of
dark
gray
and
very
workmanlike
they
looked
as
in
column
of
fours
each
troop
trotted
down
its
company
street
to
form
by
squadron
or
battalion
the
troopers
sitting
steadily
in
the
saddles
as
they
made
their
horses
conform
to
the
movement
of
the
guidons
over
in
tampa
town
the
huge
winter
hotel
was
gay
with
general
officers
and
their
staffs
with
women
in
pretty
dresses
with
newspaper
correspondents
by
the
score
with
military
attaches
of
foreign
powers
and
with
onlookers
of
all
sorts
but
we
spent
very
little
time
there
we
worked
with
the
utmost
industry
special
attention
being
given
by
each
to
in
the
woods
once
or
twice
we
had
mounted
drill
of
the
regiment
as
a
whole
the
military
attaches
came
out
to
look
on
english
german
russian
french
and
japanese
with
the
englishman
captain
arthur
lee
a
capital
fellow
we
soon
struck
up
an
especially
close
friendship
and
we
saw
much
of
him
throughout
the
campaign
so
we
did
of
several
of
the
newspaper
correspondents
richard
harding
davis
john
fox
caspar
whitney
and
frederic
remington
on
sunday
chaplain
brown
of
arizona
held
service
as
he
did
almost
every
sunday
during
the
campaign
there
were
but
four
or
five
days
at
tampa
however
we
were
notified
that
the
expedition
would
start
for
destination
unknown
at
once
and
that
we
were
to
go
with
it
but
that
our
horses
were
to
be
left
behind
and
only
eight
troops
of
seventy
men
each
taken
our
sorrow
at
leaving
the
horses
was
entirely
outweighed
by
our
joy
at
going
but
it
was
very
hard
indeed
to
select
the
four
troops
that
were
to
stay
and
the
men
who
had
to
be
left
behind
from
each
of
the
troops
that
went
colonel
wood
took
major
brodie
and
myself
to
command
the
two
squadrons
being
allowed
only
two
squadron
commanders
the
men
who
were
left
behind
felt
the
most
bitter
heartburn
to
the
great
bulk
of
them
i
think
it
will
be
a
sorrow
i
saw
more
than
one
both
among
the
officers
and
privates
burst
into
tears
when
he
found
he
could
not
go
no
outsider
can
appreciate
the
bitterness
of
the
disappointment
of
course
really
those
that
stayed
were
entitled
to
precisely
as
much
honor
as
those
that
went
each
man
was
doing
his
duty
and
much
the
hardest
and
most
disagreeable
duty
was
to
stay
credit
should
go
with
the
performance
of
duty
and
not
with
what
is
very
often
the
accident
of
glory
all
this
and
much
more
we
explained
but
our
explanations
could
not
alter
the
fact
that
some
had
to
be
chosen
and
some
had
to
be
left
one
of
the
captains
chosen
was
captain
maximilian
luna
who
commanded
troop
f
from
new
mexico
the
people
had
been
on
the
banks
of
the
rio
grande
before
my
forefathers
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
hudson
or
wood
landed
at
plymouth
and
he
made
the
plea
that
it
was
his
right
to
go
as
a
representative
of
his
race
for
he
was
the
only
man
of
pure
spanish
blood
who
bore
a
commission
in
the
army
and
he
demanded
the
privilege
of
proving
that
his
people
were
precisely
as
loyal
americans
as
any
others
i
was
glad
when
it
was
decided
to
take
him
it
was
the
evening
of
june
when
we
suddenly
received
orders
that
the
expedition
was
to
start
from
port
tampa
nine
miles
distant
by
rail
at
daybreak
the
following
morning
and
that
if
we
were
not
aboard
our
transport
by
that
time
we
could
not
go
we
had
no
intention
of
getting
left
and
prepared
at
once
for
the
scramble
which
was
evidently
about
to
take
place
as
the
number
and
capacity
of
the
transports
were
known
or
ought
to
have
been
known
and
as
the
number
and
size
of
the
regiments
to
go
were
also
known
the
task
of
allotting
each
regiment
or
fraction
of
a
regiment
to
its
proper
transport
and
arranging
that
the
regiments
and
the
transports
should
meet
in
due
order
on
the
dock
ought
not
to
have
been
difficult
however
no
arrangements
were
made
in
advance
and
we
were
allowed
to
shove
and
hustle
for
ourselves
as
best
we
could
on
much
the
same
principles
that
had
governed
our
preparations
hitherto
we
were
ordered
to
be
at
a
certain
track
with
all
our
baggage
at
midnight
there
to
take
a
train
for
port
tampa
at
the
appointed
time
we
turned
up
but
the
train
did
not
the
men
slept
heavily
while
wood
and
i
and
various
other
officers
wandered
about
in
search
of
information
which
no
one
could
give
we
now
and
then
came
across
a
or
even
a
but
nobody
knew
anything
some
regiments
got
aboard
the
trains
and
some
did
not
but
as
none
of
the
trains
started
this
made
little
difference
at
three
we
received
orders
to
march
over
to
an
entirely
different
track
and
away
we
went
no
train
appeared
on
this
track
either
but
at
six
some
came
by
and
these
we
seized
by
various
arguments
we
persuaded
the
engineer
in
charge
of
the
train
to
back
us
down
the
nine
miles
to
port
tampa
where
we
arrived
covered
with
but
with
all
our
belongings
the
railway
tracks
ran
out
on
the
quay
and
the
transports
which
had
been
anchored
in
midstream
were
gradually
being
brought
up
alongside
the
quay
and
loaded
the
trains
were
unloading
wherever
they
happened
to
be
no
attention
whatever
being
paid
to
the
possible
position
of
the
transport
on
which
the
soldiers
were
to
go
colonel
wood
and
i
jumped
off
and
started
on
a
hunt
which
soon
convinced
us
that
we
had
our
work
cut
out
if
we
were
to
get
a
transport
at
all
from
the
highest
general
down
nobody
could
tell
us
where
to
go
to
find
out
what
transport
we
were
to
have
at
last
we
were
informed
that
we
were
to
hunt
up
the
depot
quartermaster
colonel
humphrey
we
found
his
office
where
his
assistant
informed
us
that
he
did
know
where
the
colonel
was
but
believed
him
to
be
asleep
upon
one
of
the
transports
this
seemed
odd
at
such
a
time
but
so
many
of
the
methods
in
vogue
were
odd
that
we
were
quite
prepared
to
accept
it
as
a
fact
however
it
proved
not
to
be
such
but
for
an
hour
colonel
humphrey
might
just
as
well
have
been
asleep
as
nobody
knew
where
he
was
and
nobody
could
find
him
and
the
quay
was
crammed
with
some
ten
thousand
men
most
of
whom
were
working
at
cross
purposes
at
last
however
after
over
an
hour
industrious
and
rapid
search
through
this
swarming
of
humanity
wood
and
i
who
had
separated
found
colonel
humphrey
at
nearly
the
same
time
and
were
allotted
a
transport
the
yucatan
she
was
out
in
midstream
so
wood
seized
a
stray
launch
and
boarded
her
at
the
same
time
i
happened
to
find
out
that
she
had
previously
been
allotted
to
two
other
regiments
the
second
regular
infantry
and
the
new
york
volunteers
which
latter
regiment
alone
contained
more
men
than
could
be
put
aboard
her
accordingly
i
ran
at
full
speed
to
our
train
and
leaving
a
strong
guard
with
the
baggage
i
the
rest
of
the
regiment
up
to
the
boat
just
in
time
to
board
her
as
she
came
into
the
quay
and
then
to
hold
her
against
the
second
regulars
and
the
who
had
arrived
a
little
too
late
being
a
shade
less
ready
than
we
were
in
the
matter
of
individual
initiative
there
was
a
good
deal
of
expostulation
but
we
had
possession
and
as
the
ship
could
not
contain
half
of
the
men
who
had
been
told
to
go
aboard
her
the
went
away
as
did
all
but
four
companies
of
the
second
these
latter
we
took
aboard
meanwhile
a
general
had
caused
our
train
to
be
unloaded
at
the
end
of
the
quay
farthest
from
where
the
ship
was
and
the
hungry
tired
men
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
labor
of
bringing
down
their
baggage
and
the
food
and
ammunition
the
officers
horses
were
on
another
boat
my
own
being
accompanied
by
my
colored
marshall
the
most
faithful
and
loyal
of
men
himself
an
old
soldier
of
the
ninth
cavalry
marshall
had
been
in
indian
campaigns
and
he
christened
my
larger
horse
while
the
other
a
pony
went
by
the
name
of
texas
by
the
time
that
night
fell
and
our
transport
pulled
off
and
anchored
in
midstream
we
felt
we
had
spent
tolerably
active
hours
the
transport
was
overloaded
the
men
being
packed
like
sardines
not
only
below
but
upon
the
decks
so
that
at
night
it
was
only
possible
to
walk
about
by
continually
stepping
over
the
bodies
of
the
sleepers
the
travel
rations
which
had
been
issued
to
the
men
for
the
voyage
were
not
sufficient
because
the
meat
was
very
bad
indeed
and
when
a
ration
consists
of
only
four
or
five
items
which
taken
together
just
meet
the
requirements
of
a
strong
and
healthy
man
the
loss
of
one
item
is
a
serious
thing
if
we
had
been
given
canned
corned
beef
we
would
have
been
all
right
but
instead
of
this
the
soldiers
were
issued
horrible
stuff
called
canned
fresh
beef
there
was
no
salt
in
it
at
the
best
it
was
stringy
and
tasteless
at
the
worst
it
was
nauseating
not
of
it
was
ever
eaten
at
all
even
when
the
men
became
very
hungry
there
were
no
facilities
for
the
men
to
cook
anything
there
was
no
ice
for
them
the
water
was
not
good
and
they
had
no
fresh
meat
or
fresh
vegetables
however
all
these
things
seemed
of
small
importance
compared
with
the
fact
that
we
were
really
embarked
and
were
with
the
first
expedition
to
leave
our
shores
but
by
next
morning
came
the
news
that
the
order
to
sail
had
been
countermanded
and
that
we
were
to
stay
where
we
were
for
the
time
being
what
this
meant
none
of
us
could
understand
it
turned
out
later
to
be
due
to
the
blunder
of
a
naval
officer
who
mistook
some
of
our
vessels
for
spaniards
and
by
his
report
caused
consternation
in
washington
until
by
vigorous
scouting
on
the
part
of
our
other
ships
the
illusion
was
dispelled
meanwhile
the
packed
tight
with
their
living
freight
sweltered
in
the
burning
heat
of
tampa
harbor
there
was
nothing
whatever
for
the
men
to
do
space
being
too
cramped
for
amusement
or
for
more
drill
than
was
implied
in
the
manual
of
arms
in
this
we
drilled
them
assiduously
and
we
also
continued
to
hold
school
for
both
the
officers
and
the
officers
each
troop
commander
was
regarded
as
responsible
for
his
own
officers
and
wood
or
myself
simply
dropped
in
to
superintend
just
as
we
did
with
the
manual
of
arms
in
the
officers
school
captain
capron
was
the
special
instructor
and
a
most
admirable
one
he
was
the
heat
the
steaming
discomfort
and
the
confinement
together
with
the
forced
inaction
were
very
irksome
but
everyone
made
the
best
of
it
and
there
was
little
or
no
grumbling
even
among
the
men
all
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
were
bent
upon
perfecting
themselves
according
to
their
slender
opportunities
every
book
of
tactics
in
the
regiment
was
in
use
from
morning
until
night
and
the
officers
and
officers
were
always
studying
the
problems
presented
at
the
schools
about
the
only
amusement
was
bathing
over
the
side
in
which
we
indulged
both
in
the
morning
and
evening
many
of
the
men
from
the
far
west
had
never
seen
the
ocean
one
of
them
who
knew
how
to
swim
was
much
interested
in
finding
that
the
ocean
water
was
not
drinkable
another
who
had
never
in
his
life
before
seen
any
water
more
extensive
than
the
headstream
of
the
rio
grande
met
with
an
accident
later
in
the
voyage
that
is
his
hat
blew
away
while
we
were
in
and
i
heard
him
explaining
the
accident
to
a
friend
in
the
following
words
jim
ma
hat
blew
into
the
creek
so
we
lay
for
nearly
a
week
the
vessels
swinging
around
on
their
anchor
chains
while
the
hot
water
of
the
bay
flowed
to
and
fro
around
them
and
the
sun
burned
overhead
at
last
on
the
evening
of
june
we
received
the
welcome
order
to
start
ship
after
ship
weighed
anchor
and
went
slowly
ahead
under
for
the
distant
mouth
of
the
harbor
the
bands
playing
the
flags
flying
the
rigging
black
with
the
clustered
soldiers
cheering
and
shouting
to
those
left
behind
on
the
quay
and
to
their
fellows
on
the
other
ships
the
channel
was
very
tortuous
and
we
anchored
before
we
had
gone
far
down
it
after
coming
within
an
ace
of
a
bad
collision
with
another
transport
the
next
morning
we
were
all
again
under
way
and
in
the
afternoon
the
great
fleet
steamed
southeast
until
tampa
light
sank
in
the
distance
for
the
next
six
days
we
sailed
steadily
southward
and
eastward
through
the
wonderful
sapphire
seas
of
the
west
indies
the
thirty
odd
transports
moved
in
long
parallel
lines
while
ahead
and
behind
and
on
their
flanks
the
gray
hulls
of
the
surged
through
the
blue
water
we
had
every
variety
of
craft
to
guard
us
from
the
mighty
and
swift
cruiser
to
the
converted
yachts
and
the
frail
the
watched
with
ceaseless
vigilance
by
day
and
night
when
a
sail
of
any
kind
appeared
instantly
one
of
our
guardians
steamed
toward
it
ordinarily
the
were
towed
once
a
strange
ship
steamed
up
too
close
and
instantly
the
nearest
was
slipped
like
a
greyhound
from
the
leash
and
sped
across
the
water
toward
it
but
the
stranger
proved
harmless
and
the
swift
delicate
craft
returned
again
it
was
very
pleasant
sailing
southward
through
the
tropic
seas
toward
the
unknown
we
knew
not
whither
we
were
bound
nor
what
we
were
to
do
but
we
believed
that
the
nearing
future
held
for
us
many
chances
of
death
and
hardship
of
honor
and
renown
if
we
failed
we
would
share
the
fate
of
all
who
fail
but
we
were
sure
that
we
would
win
that
we
should
score
the
first
great
triumph
in
a
mighty
world
movement
at
night
we
looked
at
the
new
stars
and
hailed
the
southern
cross
when
at
last
we
raised
it
above
the
horizon
in
the
daytime
we
drilled
and
in
the
evening
we
held
officers
school
but
there
was
much
time
when
we
had
little
to
do
save
to
scan
the
wonderful
blue
sea
and
watch
the
toward
evening
when
the
officers
clustered
together
on
the
forward
bridge
the
band
of
the
second
infantry
played
tune
after
tune
until
on
our
quarter
the
glorious
sun
sunk
in
the
red
west
and
one
by
one
the
lights
blazed
out
on
and
for
miles
ahead
and
astern
as
they
steamed
onward
through
the
brilliant
tropic
night
the
men
on
the
ship
were
young
and
strong
eager
to
face
what
lay
hidden
before
them
eager
for
adventure
where
risk
was
the
price
of
gain
sometimes
they
talked
of
what
they
might
do
in
the
future
and
wondered
whether
we
were
to
attack
santiago
or
porto
rico
at
other
times
as
they
lounged
in
groups
they
told
stories
of
their
past
stories
of
the
mining
camps
and
the
cattle
ranges
of
hunting
bear
and
deer
of
against
the
indians
of
lawless
deeds
of
violence
and
the
lawful
violence
by
which
they
were
avenged
of
brawls
in
saloons
of
shrewd
deals
in
cattle
and
sheep
of
successful
quests
for
the
precious
metals
stories
of
brutal
wrong
and
brutal
appetite
melancholy
and
memories
of
nameless
heroes
masters
of
men
and
tamers
of
horses
the
officers
too
had
many
strange
experiences
to
relate
none
not
even
llewellen
or
had
been
through
what
was
better
worth
telling
or
could
tell
it
better
than
capron
he
had
spent
years
among
the
apaches
the
wildest
and
fiercest
of
tribes
and
again
and
again
had
owed
his
life
to
his
own
cool
judgment
and
extraordinary
personal
prowess
he
knew
the
sign
language
familiar
to
all
the
indians
of
the
mountains
and
the
plains
and
it
was
curious
to
find
that
the
signs
for
different
animals
for
water
for
sleep
and
death
which
he
knew
from
holding
intercourse
with
the
tribes
of
the
southeast
were
exactly
like
those
which
i
had
picked
up
on
my
occasional
hunting
or
trading
trips
among
the
sioux
and
mandans
of
the
north
he
was
a
great
rifle
shot
and
wolf
hunter
and
had
many
tales
to
tell
of
the
deeds
of
gallant
hounds
and
the
feats
of
famous
horses
he
had
handled
his
indian
scouts
and
dealt
with
the
bronco
indians
the
renegades
from
the
tribes
in
circumstances
of
extreme
peril
for
he
had
seen
the
sullen
moody
apaches
when
they
suddenly
went
crazy
with
wolfish
and
in
their
madness
wished
to
kill
whomever
was
nearest
he
knew
so
far
as
white
man
could
know
their
ways
of
thought
and
how
to
humor
and
divert
them
when
on
the
brink
of
some
dangerous
outbreak
capron
training
and
temper
fitted
him
to
do
great
work
in
war
and
he
looked
forward
with
eager
confidence
to
what
the
future
held
for
he
was
sure
that
for
him
it
held
either
triumph
or
death
death
was
the
prize
he
drew
most
of
the
men
had
simple
souls
they
could
relate
facts
but
they
said
very
little
about
what
they
dimly
felt
bucky
however
the
fighter
from
arizona
the
sheriff
whose
name
was
a
of
terror
to
every
white
or
red
the
gambler
who
with
unmoved
face
would
stake
and
lose
every
dollar
he
had
in
the
world
he
alone
among
his
comrades
was
a
visionary
an
articulate
emotionalist
he
was
very
quiet
about
it
never
talking
unless
he
was
sure
of
his
listener
but
at
night
when
we
leaned
on
the
railing
to
look
at
the
southern
cross
he
was
less
apt
to
tell
tales
of
his
hard
and
stormy
past
than
he
was
to
speak
of
the
mysteries
which
lie
behind
courage
and
fear
and
love
behind
animal
hatred
and
animal
lust
for
the
pleasures
that
have
tangible
shape
he
had
keenly
enjoyed
life
and
he
could
breast
its
turbulent
torrent
as
few
men
could
he
was
a
practical
man
who
knew
how
to
wrest
personal
success
from
adverse
forces
among
politicians
and
desperadoes
alike
yet
down
at
bottom
what
seemed
to
interest
him
most
was
the
philosophy
of
life
itself
of
our
understanding
of
it
and
of
the
limitations
set
to
that
understanding
but
he
was
as
far
as
possible
from
being
a
mere
dreamer
of
dreams
a
staunchly
loyal
and
generous
friend
he
was
also
exceedingly
ambitious
on
his
own
account
if
by
risking
his
life
no
matter
how
great
the
risk
he
could
gain
high
military
distinction
he
was
bent
on
gaining
it
he
had
taken
so
many
chances
when
death
lay
on
the
hazard
that
he
felt
the
odds
were
now
against
him
but
said
he
who
would
not
risk
his
life
for
a
star
had
he
lived
and
had
the
war
lasted
he
would
surely
have
won
the
eagle
if
not
the
star
we
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
the
transports
chiefly
because
they
were
not
under
the
control
of
the
navy
one
of
them
was
towing
a
schooner
and
another
a
scow
both
of
course
kept
lagging
behind
finally
when
we
had
gone
nearly
the
length
of
cuba
the
transport
with
the
schooner
sagged
very
far
behind
and
then
our
wretched
transport
was
directed
by
general
shafter
to
fall
out
of
line
and
keep
her
company
of
course
we
executed
the
order
greatly
to
the
wrath
of
captain
clover
who
in
the
gunboat
bancroft
had
charge
of
the
rear
of
the
column
for
we
could
be
of
no
earthly
use
to
the
other
transport
and
by
our
presence
simply
added
just
so
much
to
captain
clover
anxiety
as
he
had
two
transports
to
protect
instead
of
one
next
morning
the
rest
of
the
convoy
were
out
of
sight
but
we
reached
them
just
as
they
finally
turned
until
this
we
had
steamed
with
the
blowing
steadily
in
our
faces
but
once
we
were
well
to
eastward
of
cuba
we
ran
southwest
with
the
wind
behind
on
our
quarter
and
we
all
knew
that
our
destination
was
santiago
on
the
morning
of
the
we
were
close
to
the
cuban
coast
high
mountains
rose
almost
from
the
water
edge
looking
huge
and
barren
across
the
sea
we
sped
onward
past
guantanamo
bay
where
we
saw
the
little
of
the
fleet
and
in
the
afternoon
we
sighted
santiago
harbor
with
the
great
standing
off
and
on
in
front
of
it
gray
and
sullen
in
their
all
next
day
we
rolled
and
wallowed
in
the
seaway
waiting
until
a
decision
was
reached
as
to
where
we
should
land
on
the
morning
of
june
the
welcome
order
for
landing
came
we
did
the
landing
as
we
had
done
everything
else
that
is
in
a
scramble
each
commander
shifting
for
himself
the
port
at
which
we
landed
was
called
daiquiri
a
squalid
little
village
where
there
had
been
a
railway
and
there
were
no
facilities
for
landing
and
the
fleet
did
not
have
a
quarter
the
number
of
boats
it
should
have
had
for
the
purpose
all
we
could
do
was
to
stand
in
with
the
transports
as
close
as
possible
and
then
row
ashore
in
our
own
few
boats
and
the
boats
of
the
luck
favored
our
regiment
my
former
naval
aide
while
i
was
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
lieutenant
sharp
was
in
command
of
the
vixen
a
converted
yacht
and
everything
being
managed
on
the
principle
he
steamed
by
us
and
offered
to
help
put
us
ashore
of
course
we
jumped
at
the
chance
wood
and
i
boarded
the
vixen
and
there
we
got
lieutenant
sharp
black
cuban
pilot
who
told
us
he
could
take
our
transport
right
in
to
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
land
accordingly
we
put
him
aboard
and
in
he
brought
her
gaining
at
least
a
mile
and
a
half
by
the
manoeuvre
the
other
transports
followed
but
we
had
our
berth
and
were
all
right
there
was
plenty
of
excitement
to
the
landing
in
the
first
place
the
smaller
shelled
daiquiri
so
as
to
dislodge
any
spaniards
who
might
be
lurking
in
the
neighborhood
and
also
shelled
other
places
along
the
coast
to
keep
the
enemy
puzzled
as
to
our
intentions
then
the
surf
was
high
and
the
landing
difficult
so
that
the
task
of
getting
the
men
the
ammunition
and
provisions
ashore
was
not
easy
each
man
carried
three
days
field
rations
and
a
hundred
rounds
of
ammunition
our
regiment
had
accumulated
two
colt
automatic
guns
the
gift
of
stevens
kane
tiffany
and
one
or
two
others
of
the
new
york
men
and
also
a
dynamite
gun
under
the
immediate
charge
of
sergeant
borrowe
to
get
these
and
especially
the
last
ashore
involved
no
little
work
and
hazard
meanwhile
from
another
transport
our
horses
were
being
landed
together
with
the
mules
by
the
simple
process
of
throwing
them
overboard
and
letting
them
swim
ashore
if
they
could
both
of
wood
got
safely
through
one
of
mine
was
drowned
the
other
little
texas
got
ashore
all
right
while
i
was
superintending
the
landing
at
the
ruined
dock
with
bucky
a
boatful
of
colored
infantry
soldiers
capsized
and
two
of
the
men
went
to
the
bottom
bucky
plunging
in
in
full
uniform
to
save
them
but
in
vain
however
by
the
late
afternoon
we
had
all
our
men
with
what
ammunition
and
provisions
they
could
themselves
carry
landed
and
were
ready
for
anything
that
might
turn
up
iii
general
young
fight
at
las
guasimas
just
before
leaving
tampa
we
had
been
brigaded
with
the
first
white
and
tenth
colored
regular
cavalry
under
young
we
were
the
second
brigade
the
first
brigade
consisting
of
the
third
and
sixth
white
and
the
ninth
colored
regular
cavalry
under
sumner
the
two
brigades
of
the
cavalry
division
were
under
joseph
wheeler
the
gallant
old
confederate
cavalry
commander
general
young
was
and
is
as
fine
a
type
of
the
american
fighting
soldier
as
a
man
can
hope
to
see
he
had
been
in
command
as
colonel
of
the
yellowstone
national
park
and
i
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
in
connection
therewith
as
i
was
president
of
the
boone
and
crockett
club
an
organization
devoted
to
hunting
big
game
to
its
preservation
and
to
forest
preservation
during
the
preceding
winter
while
he
was
in
washington
he
had
lunched
with
me
at
the
metropolitan
club
wood
being
one
of
the
other
guests
of
course
we
talked
of
the
war
which
all
of
us
present
believed
to
be
impending
and
wood
and
i
told
him
we
were
going
to
make
every
effort
to
get
in
somehow
and
he
answered
that
we
must
be
sure
to
get
into
his
brigade
if
he
had
one
and
he
would
guarantee
to
show
us
fighting
none
of
us
forgot
the
conversation
as
soon
as
our
regiment
was
raised
general
young
applied
for
it
to
be
put
in
his
brigade
we
were
put
in
and
he
made
his
word
good
for
he
fought
and
won
the
first
fight
on
cuban
soil
yet
even
though
under
him
we
should
not
have
been
in
this
fight
at
all
if
we
had
not
taken
advantage
of
the
chance
to
disembark
among
the
first
troops
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
wood
energy
in
pushing
our
regiment
to
the
front
on
landing
we
spent
some
active
hours
in
marching
our
men
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
inland
as
by
they
disembarked
meanwhile
one
of
the
men
knoblauch
a
new
yorker
who
was
a
great
athlete
and
a
champion
swimmer
by
diving
in
the
surf
off
the
dock
recovered
most
of
the
rifles
which
had
been
lost
when
the
of
colored
cavalry
capsized
the
country
would
have
offered
very
great
difficulties
to
an
attacking
force
had
there
been
resistance
it
was
little
but
a
mass
of
rugged
and
precipitous
hills
covered
for
the
most
part
by
dense
jungle
five
hundred
resolute
men
could
have
prevented
the
disembarkation
at
very
little
cost
to
themselves
there
had
been
about
that
number
of
spaniards
at
daiquiri
that
morning
but
they
had
fled
even
before
the
ships
began
shelling
in
their
place
we
found
hundreds
of
cuban
insurgents
a
crew
of
as
utter
tatterdemalions
as
human
eyes
ever
looked
on
armed
with
every
kind
of
rifle
in
all
stages
of
dilapidation
it
was
evident
at
a
glance
that
they
would
be
no
use
in
serious
fighting
but
it
was
hoped
that
they
might
be
of
service
in
scouting
from
a
variety
of
causes
however
they
turned
out
to
be
nearly
useless
even
for
this
purpose
so
far
as
the
santiago
campaign
was
concerned
we
were
camped
on
a
dusty
flat
with
jungle
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
shallow
fetid
pool
fringed
with
huge
scuttled
noisily
through
the
underbrush
exciting
much
interest
among
the
men
camping
was
a
simple
matter
as
each
man
carried
all
he
had
and
the
officers
had
nothing
i
took
a
light
mackintosh
and
a
fortunately
that
night
it
did
not
rain
and
from
the
we
built
shelters
from
the
sun
general
lawton
a
tall
man
had
taken
the
advance
a
thorough
soldier
he
at
once
established
outposts
and
pushed
reconnoitring
parties
ahead
on
the
trails
he
had
as
little
baggage
as
the
rest
of
us
our
own
general
young
had
exactly
the
same
impedimenta
that
i
had
namely
a
mackintosh
and
a
next
morning
we
were
hard
at
work
trying
to
get
the
stuff
unloaded
from
the
ship
and
succeeded
in
getting
most
of
it
ashore
but
were
utterly
unable
to
get
transportation
for
anything
but
a
very
small
quantity
the
great
shortcoming
throughout
the
campaign
was
the
utterly
inadequate
transportation
if
we
had
been
allowed
to
take
our
we
could
have
kept
the
whole
cavalry
division
supplied
in
the
afternoon
word
came
to
us
to
march
general
wheeler
a
regular
was
as
anxious
as
lawton
to
get
first
blood
and
he
was
bent
upon
putting
the
cavalry
division
to
the
front
as
quickly
as
possible
lawton
was
in
touch
with
the
spaniards
and
there
had
been
a
skirmish
between
the
latter
and
some
cubans
who
were
repulsed
general
wheeler
made
a
reconnaissance
in
person
found
out
where
the
enemy
was
and
directed
general
young
to
take
our
brigade
and
move
forward
so
as
to
strike
him
next
morning
he
had
the
power
to
do
this
as
when
general
shafter
was
afloat
he
had
command
ashore
i
had
succeeded
in
finding
texas
my
surviving
horse
much
the
worse
for
his
fortnight
on
the
transport
and
his
experience
in
getting
off
but
still
able
to
carry
me
it
was
and
the
tropic
sun
was
beating
fiercely
down
when
colonel
wood
started
our
regiment
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
and
some
of
the
infantry
regiments
having
already
marched
colonel
wood
himself
rode
in
advance
while
i
led
my
squadron
and
major
brodie
followed
with
his
it
was
a
hard
march
the
hilly
jungle
trail
being
so
narrow
that
often
we
had
to
go
in
single
file
we
marched
fast
for
wood
was
bound
to
get
us
ahead
of
the
other
regiments
so
as
to
be
sure
of
our
place
in
the
body
that
struck
the
enemy
next
morning
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
energy
in
pushing
forward
we
should
certainly
have
missed
the
fight
as
it
was
we
did
not
halt
until
we
were
at
the
extreme
front
the
men
were
not
in
very
good
shape
for
marching
and
moreover
they
were
really
horsemen
the
majority
being
cowboys
who
had
never
done
much
walking
the
heat
was
intense
and
their
burdens
very
heavy
yet
there
was
very
little
straggling
whenever
we
halted
they
instantly
took
off
their
packs
and
threw
themselves
on
their
backs
then
at
the
word
to
start
they
would
spring
into
place
again
the
captains
and
lieutenants
tramped
along
encouraging
the
men
by
example
and
word
a
good
part
of
the
time
i
was
by
captain
llewellen
and
was
greatly
pleased
to
see
the
way
in
which
he
kept
his
men
up
to
their
work
he
never
pitied
or
coddled
his
troopers
but
he
always
looked
after
them
he
helped
them
whenever
he
could
and
took
rather
more
than
his
full
share
of
hardship
and
danger
so
that
his
men
naturally
followed
him
with
entire
devotion
jack
greenway
was
under
him
as
lieutenant
and
to
him
the
entire
march
was
nothing
but
an
enjoyable
outing
the
chance
of
fight
on
the
morrow
simply
adding
the
needed
spice
of
excitement
it
was
long
after
nightfall
when
we
tramped
through
the
darkness
into
the
squalid
coast
hamlet
of
siboney
as
usual
when
we
made
a
night
camp
we
simply
drew
the
men
up
in
column
of
troops
and
then
let
each
man
lie
down
where
he
was
black
were
gathering
before
they
broke
the
fires
were
made
and
the
men
cooked
their
coffee
and
pork
some
frying
the
with
the
pork
the
officers
of
course
fared
just
as
the
men
did
hardly
had
we
finished
eating
when
the
rain
came
a
regular
tropic
downpour
we
sat
about
sheltering
ourselves
as
best
we
could
for
the
hour
or
two
it
lasted
then
the
fires
were
relighted
and
we
closed
around
them
the
men
taking
off
their
wet
things
to
dry
them
so
far
as
possible
by
the
blaze
wood
had
gone
off
to
see
general
young
as
general
wheeler
had
instructed
general
young
to
hit
the
spaniards
who
were
about
four
miles
away
as
soon
after
daybreak
as
possible
meanwhile
i
strolled
over
to
captain
capron
troop
he
and
i
with
his
two
lieutenants
day
and
thomas
stood
around
the
fire
together
with
two
or
three
officers
and
privates
among
the
latter
were
sergeant
hamilton
fish
and
trooper
elliot
cowdin
both
of
new
york
cowdin
together
with
two
other
troopers
harry
thorpe
and
munro
ferguson
had
been
on
my
oyster
bay
polo
team
some
years
before
hamilton
fish
had
already
shown
himself
one
of
the
best
officers
we
had
a
huge
fellow
of
enormous
strength
and
endurance
and
dauntless
courage
he
took
naturally
to
a
soldier
life
he
never
complained
and
never
shirked
any
duty
of
any
kind
while
his
power
over
his
men
was
great
so
good
a
sergeant
had
he
made
that
captain
capron
keen
to
get
the
best
men
under
him
took
him
when
he
left
tampa
for
troop
remained
behind
as
we
stood
around
the
flickering
blaze
that
night
i
caught
myself
admiring
the
splendid
bodily
vigor
of
capron
and
fish
the
captain
and
the
sergeant
their
frames
seemed
of
steel
to
withstand
all
fatigue
they
were
flushed
with
health
in
their
eyes
shone
high
resolve
and
fiery
desire
two
finer
types
of
the
fighting
man
two
better
representatives
of
the
american
soldier
there
were
not
in
the
whole
army
capron
was
going
over
his
plans
for
the
fight
when
we
should
meet
the
spaniards
on
the
morrow
fish
occasionally
asking
a
question
they
were
both
filled
with
eager
longing
to
show
their
mettle
and
both
were
rightly
confident
that
if
they
lived
they
would
win
honorable
renown
and
would
rise
high
in
their
chosen
profession
within
twelve
hours
they
both
were
dead
i
had
lain
down
when
toward
midnight
wood
returned
he
had
gone
over
the
whole
plan
with
general
young
we
were
to
start
by
sunrise
toward
santiago
general
young
taking
four
troops
of
the
tenth
and
four
troops
of
the
first
up
the
road
which
led
through
the
valley
while
colonel
wood
was
to
lead
our
eight
troops
along
a
to
the
left
which
joined
the
valley
road
about
four
miles
on
at
a
point
where
the
road
went
over
a
spur
of
the
mountain
chain
and
from
thence
went
down
hill
toward
santiago
the
spaniards
had
their
lines
at
the
junction
of
the
road
and
the
trail
before
describing
our
part
in
the
fight
it
is
necessary
to
say
a
word
about
general
young
share
for
of
course
the
whole
fight
was
under
his
direction
and
the
fight
on
the
right
wing
under
his
immediate
supervision
general
young
had
obtained
from
general
castillo
the
commander
of
the
cuban
forces
a
full
description
of
the
country
in
front
general
castillo
promised
young
the
aid
of
eight
hundred
cubans
if
he
made
a
reconnaissance
in
force
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
spanish
strength
was
this
promised
cuban
aid
did
not
however
materialize
the
cubans
who
had
been
beaten
back
by
the
spaniards
the
day
before
not
appearing
on
the
until
the
fight
was
over
general
young
had
in
his
immediate
command
a
squadron
of
the
first
regular
cavalry
two
hundred
and
strong
under
the
command
of
major
bell
and
a
squadron
of
the
tenth
regular
cavalry
two
hundred
and
twenty
strong
under
the
command
of
major
norvell
he
also
had
two
hotchkiss
mountain
guns
under
captain
watson
of
the
tenth
he
started
at
a
quarter
before
six
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
captain
mills
as
aide
it
was
at
seven
that
captain
mills
with
a
patrol
of
two
men
in
advance
discovered
the
spaniards
as
they
lay
across
where
the
two
roads
came
together
some
of
them
in
pits
others
simply
lying
in
the
heavy
jungle
while
on
their
extreme
right
they
occupied
a
big
ranch
where
general
young
struck
them
they
held
a
high
ridge
a
little
to
the
left
of
his
front
this
ridge
being
separated
by
a
deep
ravine
from
the
still
farther
to
the
left
down
which
the
rough
riders
were
advancing
that
is
their
forces
occupied
a
range
of
high
hills
in
the
form
of
an
obtuse
angle
the
salient
being
toward
the
space
between
the
american
forces
while
there
were
advance
parties
along
both
roads
there
were
stone
breastworks
flanked
by
on
that
part
of
the
ridge
where
the
two
trails
came
together
the
place
was
called
las
guasimas
from
trees
of
that
name
in
the
neighborhood
general
young
who
was
riding
a
mule
carefully
examined
the
spanish
position
in
person
he
ordered
the
canteens
of
the
troops
to
be
filled
placed
the
hotchkiss
battery
in
concealment
about
nine
hundred
yards
from
the
spanish
lines
and
then
deployed
the
white
regulars
with
the
colored
regulars
in
support
having
sent
a
cuban
guide
to
try
to
find
colonel
wood
and
warn
him
he
did
not
attack
immediately
because
he
knew
that
colonel
wood
having
a
more
difficult
route
would
require
a
longer
time
to
reach
the
position
during
the
delay
general
wheeler
arrived
he
had
been
up
since
long
before
dawn
to
see
that
everything
went
well
young
informed
him
of
the
dispositions
and
plan
of
attack
he
made
general
wheeler
approved
of
them
and
with
excellent
judgment
left
general
young
a
free
hand
to
fight
his
battle
so
about
eight
young
began
the
fight
with
his
hotchkiss
guns
he
himself
being
up
on
the
no
sooner
had
the
hotchkiss
opened
than
the
spaniards
opened
fire
in
return
most
of
the
time
firing
by
volleys
executed
in
perfect
time
almost
as
on
parade
they
had
a
couple
of
light
guns
which
our
people
thought
were
quick
firers
the
denseness
of
the
jungle
and
the
fact
that
they
used
absolutely
smokeless
powder
made
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
place
exactly
where
they
were
and
almost
immediately
young
who
always
liked
to
get
as
close
as
possible
to
his
enemy
began
to
push
his
troops
forward
they
were
deployed
on
both
sides
of
the
road
in
such
thick
jungle
that
it
was
only
here
and
there
that
they
could
possibly
see
ahead
and
some
confusion
of
course
ensued
the
support
gradually
getting
mixed
with
the
advance
captain
beck
took
a
troop
of
the
tenth
in
on
the
left
next
captain
troop
of
the
first
two
other
troops
of
the
tenth
were
on
the
extreme
right
through
the
jungle
ran
wire
fences
here
and
there
and
as
the
troops
got
to
the
ridge
they
encountered
precipitous
heights
they
were
led
most
gallantly
as
american
regular
officers
always
lead
their
men
and
the
men
followed
their
leaders
with
the
splendid
courage
always
shown
by
the
american
regular
soldier
there
was
not
a
single
straggler
among
them
and
in
not
one
instance
was
an
attempt
made
by
any
trooper
to
fall
out
in
order
to
assist
the
wounded
or
carry
back
the
dead
while
so
cool
were
they
and
so
perfect
their
fire
discipline
that
in
the
entire
engagement
the
expenditure
of
ammunition
was
not
over
ten
rounds
per
man
major
bell
who
commanded
the
squadron
had
his
leg
broken
by
a
shot
as
he
was
leading
his
men
captain
wainwright
succeeded
to
the
command
of
the
squadron
captain
knox
was
shot
in
the
abdomen
he
continued
for
some
time
giving
orders
to
his
troops
and
refused
to
allow
a
man
in
the
to
assist
him
to
the
rear
his
first
lieutenant
byram
was
himself
shot
but
continued
to
lead
his
men
until
the
wound
and
the
heat
overcame
him
and
he
fell
in
a
faint
the
advance
was
pushed
forward
under
general
young
eye
with
the
utmost
energy
until
the
enemy
voices
could
be
heard
in
the
entrenchments
the
spaniards
kept
up
a
very
heavy
firing
but
the
regulars
would
not
be
denied
and
as
they
climbed
the
ridges
the
spaniards
broke
and
fled
meanwhile
at
six
the
rough
riders
began
their
advance
we
first
had
to
climb
a
very
steep
hill
many
of
the
men
and
weary
from
their
march
of
the
preceding
day
found
the
pace
up
this
hill
too
hard
and
either
dropped
their
bundles
or
fell
out
of
line
with
the
result
that
we
went
into
action
with
less
than
five
hundred
men
as
in
addition
to
the
stragglers
a
detachment
had
been
left
to
guard
the
baggage
on
shore
at
the
time
i
was
rather
inclined
to
grumble
to
myself
about
wood
setting
so
fast
a
pace
but
when
the
fight
began
i
realized
that
it
had
been
absolutely
necessary
as
otherwise
we
should
have
arrived
late
and
the
regulars
would
have
had
very
hard
work
indeed
tiffany
by
great
exertions
had
corralled
a
couple
of
mules
and
was
using
them
to
transport
the
colt
automatic
guns
in
the
rear
of
the
regiment
the
dynamite
gun
was
not
with
us
as
mules
for
it
could
not
be
obtained
in
time
captain
capron
troop
was
in
the
lead
it
being
chosen
for
the
most
responsible
and
dangerous
position
because
of
capron
capacity
four
men
headed
by
sergeant
hamilton
fish
went
first
a
support
of
twenty
men
followed
some
distance
behind
and
then
came
capron
and
the
rest
of
his
troop
followed
by
wood
with
whom
general
young
had
sent
lieutenants
smedburg
and
rivers
as
aides
i
rode
close
behind
at
the
head
of
the
other
three
troops
of
my
squadron
and
then
came
brodie
at
the
head
of
his
squadron
the
trail
was
so
narrow
that
for
the
most
part
the
men
marched
in
single
file
and
it
was
bordered
by
dense
tangled
jungle
through
which
a
man
could
with
difficulty
force
his
way
so
that
to
put
out
flankers
was
impossible
for
they
could
not
possibly
have
kept
up
with
the
march
of
the
column
every
man
had
his
canteen
full
there
was
a
cuban
guide
at
the
head
of
the
column
but
he
ran
away
as
soon
as
the
fighting
began
there
were
also
with
us
at
the
head
of
the
column
two
men
who
did
not
run
away
who
though
newspaper
correspondents
showed
as
much
gallantry
as
any
soldier
in
the
field
they
were
edward
marshall
and
richard
harding
davis
after
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
the
walk
was
very
pleasant
now
and
then
we
came
to
glades
or
rounded
whence
we
could
look
off
for
some
distance
the
tropical
forest
was
very
beautiful
and
it
was
a
delight
to
see
the
strange
trees
the
splendid
royal
palms
and
a
tree
which
looked
like
a
acacia
and
which
was
covered
with
a
mass
of
brilliant
scarlet
flowers
we
heard
many
too
the
cooing
of
doves
and
the
call
of
a
great
brush
cuckoo
afterward
we
found
that
the
spanish
guerillas
imitated
these
but
the
sounds
we
heard
that
morning
as
we
advanced
through
the
tropic
forest
were
from
birds
not
guerillas
until
we
came
right
up
to
the
spanish
lines
it
was
very
beautiful
and
very
peaceful
and
it
seemed
more
as
if
we
were
off
on
some
hunting
excursion
than
as
if
were
about
to
go
into
a
sharp
and
bloody
little
fight
of
course
we
accommodated
our
movements
to
those
of
the
men
in
front
after
marching
for
somewhat
over
an
hour
we
suddenly
came
to
a
halt
and
immediately
afterward
colonel
wood
sent
word
down
the
line
that
the
advance
guard
had
come
upon
a
spanish
outpost
then
the
order
was
passed
to
fill
the
magazines
which
was
done
the
men
were
totally
unconcerned
and
i
do
not
think
they
realized
that
any
fighting
was
at
hand
at
any
rate
i
could
hear
the
group
nearest
me
discussing
in
low
murmurs
not
the
spaniards
but
the
conduct
of
a
certain
in
quitting
work
on
a
ranch
and
starting
a
saloon
in
some
new
mexican
town
in
another
minute
however
wood
sent
me
orders
to
deploy
three
troops
to
the
right
of
the
trail
and
to
advance
when
we
became
engaged
while
at
the
same
time
the
other
troops
under
major
brodie
were
deployed
to
the
left
of
the
trail
where
the
ground
was
more
open
than
elsewhere
one
troop
being
held
in
reserve
in
the
centre
besides
the
reserves
on
each
wing
later
all
the
reserves
were
put
into
the
to
the
right
the
jungle
was
quite
thick
and
we
had
barely
begun
to
deploy
when
a
crash
in
front
announced
that
the
fight
was
on
it
was
evidently
very
hot
and
l
troop
had
its
hands
full
so
i
hurried
my
men
up
abreast
of
them
so
thick
was
the
jungle
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
together
especially
when
there
was
no
time
for
delay
and
while
i
got
up
llewellen
troops
and
kane
platoon
of
k
troop
the
rest
of
k
troop
under
captain
jenkins
which
with
bucky
troop
made
up
the
right
wing
were
behind
and
it
was
some
time
before
they
got
into
the
fight
at
all
meanwhile
i
had
gone
forward
with
llewellen
greenway
kane
and
their
troopers
until
we
came
out
on
a
kind
of
shoulder
jutting
over
a
ravine
which
separated
us
from
a
great
ridge
on
our
right
it
was
on
this
ridge
that
the
spaniards
had
some
of
their
intrenchments
and
it
was
just
beyond
this
ridge
that
the
valley
road
led
up
which
the
regulars
were
at
that
very
time
pushing
their
attack
but
of
course
at
the
moment
we
knew
nothing
of
this
the
effect
of
the
smokeless
powder
was
remarkable
the
air
seemed
full
of
the
rustling
sound
of
the
mauser
bullets
for
the
spaniards
knew
the
trails
by
which
we
were
advancing
and
opened
heavily
on
our
position
moreover
as
we
advanced
we
were
of
course
exposed
and
they
could
see
us
and
fire
but
they
themselves
were
entirely
invisible
the
jungle
covered
everything
and
not
the
faintest
trace
of
smoke
was
to
be
seen
in
any
direction
to
indicate
from
whence
the
bullets
came
it
was
some
time
before
the
men
fired
llewellen
kane
and
i
anxiously
studying
the
ground
to
see
where
our
opponents
were
and
utterly
unable
to
find
out
we
could
hear
the
faint
reports
of
the
hotchkiss
guns
and
the
reply
of
two
spanish
guns
and
the
mauser
bullets
were
singing
through
the
trees
over
our
heads
making
a
noise
like
the
humming
of
telephone
wires
but
exactly
where
they
came
from
we
could
not
tell
the
spaniards
were
firing
high
and
for
the
most
part
by
volleys
and
their
shooting
was
not
very
good
which
perhaps
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
as
they
were
a
long
way
off
gradually
however
they
began
to
get
the
range
and
occasionally
one
of
our
men
would
crumple
up
in
no
case
did
the
man
make
any
outcry
when
hit
seeming
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
at
the
outside
making
only
such
a
remark
as
well
i
got
it
that
time
with
hardly
an
exception
there
was
no
sign
of
flinching
i
say
with
hardly
an
exception
for
though
i
personally
did
not
see
an
instance
and
though
all
the
men
at
the
front
behaved
excellently
yet
there
were
a
very
few
men
who
lagged
behind
and
drifted
back
to
the
trail
over
which
we
had
come
the
character
of
the
fight
put
a
premium
upon
such
conduct
and
afforded
a
very
severe
test
for
raw
troops
because
the
jungle
was
so
dense
that
as
we
advanced
in
open
order
every
man
was
from
time
to
time
left
almost
alone
and
away
from
the
eyes
of
his
officers
there
was
unlimited
opportunity
for
dropping
out
without
attracting
notice
while
it
was
peculiarly
hard
to
be
exposed
to
the
fire
of
an
unseen
foe
and
to
see
men
dropping
under
it
and
yet
to
be
for
some
time
unable
to
return
it
and
also
to
be
entirely
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
in
any
other
part
of
the
field
it
was
richard
harding
davis
who
gave
us
our
first
opportunity
to
shoot
back
with
effect
he
was
behaving
precisely
like
my
officers
being
on
the
extreme
front
of
the
line
and
taking
every
opportunity
to
study
with
his
glasses
the
ground
where
we
thought
the
spaniards
were
i
had
tried
some
volley
firing
at
points
where
i
rather
doubtfully
believed
the
spaniards
to
be
but
had
stopped
firing
and
was
myself
studying
the
mountain
ahead
with
my
glasses
when
davis
suddenly
said
there
they
are
colonel
look
over
there
i
can
see
their
hats
near
that
glade
pointing
across
the
valley
to
our
right
in
a
minute
i
too
made
out
the
hats
and
then
pointed
them
out
to
three
or
four
of
our
best
shots
giving
them
my
estimate
of
the
range
for
a
minute
or
two
no
result
followed
and
i
kept
raising
the
range
at
the
same
time
getting
more
men
on
the
then
evidently
the
shots
told
for
the
spaniards
suddenly
sprang
out
of
the
cover
through
which
we
had
seen
their
hats
and
ran
to
another
spot
and
we
could
now
make
out
a
large
number
of
them
i
accordingly
got
all
of
my
men
up
in
line
and
began
quick
firing
in
a
very
few
minutes
our
bullets
began
to
do
damage
for
the
spaniards
retreated
to
the
left
into
the
jungle
and
we
lost
sight
of
them
at
the
same
moment
a
big
body
of
men
who
it
afterward
turned
out
were
spaniards
came
in
sight
along
the
glade
following
the
retreat
of
those
whom
we
had
just
driven
from
the
trenches
we
supposed
that
there
was
a
large
force
of
cubans
with
general
young
not
being
aware
that
these
cubans
had
failed
to
make
their
appearance
and
as
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
cubans
from
the
spaniards
and
as
we
could
not
decide
whether
these
were
cubans
following
the
spaniards
we
had
put
to
flight
or
merely
another
troop
of
spaniards
retreating
after
the
first
which
was
really
the
case
we
dared
not
fire
and
in
a
minute
they
had
passed
the
glade
and
were
out
of
sight
at
every
halt
we
took
advantage
of
the
cover
sinking
down
behind
any
mound
bush
or
tree
trunk
in
the
neighborhood
the
trees
of
course
furnished
no
protection
from
the
mauser
bullets
once
i
was
standing
behind
a
large
palm
with
my
head
out
to
one
side
very
fortunately
for
a
bullet
passed
through
the
palm
filling
my
left
eye
and
ear
with
the
dust
and
splinters
no
man
was
allowed
to
drop
out
to
help
the
wounded
it
was
hard
to
leave
them
there
in
the
jungle
where
they
might
not
be
found
again
until
the
vultures
and
the
came
but
war
is
a
grim
game
and
there
was
no
choice
one
of
the
men
shot
was
harry
heffner
of
g
troop
who
was
mortally
wounded
through
the
hips
he
fell
without
uttering
a
sound
and
two
of
his
companions
dragged
him
behind
a
tree
here
he
propped
himself
up
and
asked
to
be
given
his
canteen
and
his
rifle
which
i
handed
to
him
he
then
again
began
shooting
and
continued
loading
and
firing
until
the
line
moved
forward
and
we
left
him
alone
dying
in
the
gloomy
shade
when
we
found
him
again
after
the
fight
he
was
dead
at
one
time
as
i
was
out
of
touch
with
that
part
of
my
wing
commanded
by
jenkins
and
i
sent
greenway
with
sergeant
russell
a
new
yorker
and
trooper
rowland
a
new
mexican
down
in
the
valley
to
find
out
where
they
were
to
do
this
the
three
had
to
expose
themselves
to
a
very
severe
fire
but
they
were
not
men
to
whom
this
mattered
russell
was
killed
the
other
two
returned
and
reported
to
me
the
position
of
jenkins
and
they
then
resumed
their
places
on
the
after
awhile
i
noticed
blood
coming
out
of
rowland
side
and
discovered
that
he
had
been
shot
although
he
did
not
seem
to
be
taking
any
notice
of
it
he
said
the
wound
was
only
slight
but
as
i
saw
he
had
broken
a
rib
i
told
him
to
go
to
the
rear
to
the
hospital
after
some
grumbling
he
went
but
fifteen
minutes
later
he
was
back
on
the
again
and
said
he
could
not
find
the
hospital
which
i
doubted
however
i
then
let
him
stay
until
the
end
of
the
fight
after
we
had
driven
the
spaniards
off
from
their
position
to
our
right
the
firing
seemed
to
die
away
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
for
the
bullets
no
longer
struck
around
us
in
such
a
storm
as
before
though
along
the
rest
of
the
line
the
battle
was
as
brisk
as
ever
soon
we
saw
troops
appearing
across
the
ravine
not
very
far
from
where
we
had
seen
the
spaniards
whom
we
had
thought
might
be
cubans
again
we
dared
not
fire
and
carefully
studied
the
with
our
glasses
and
this
time
we
were
right
for
we
recognized
our
own
we
were
by
no
means
sure
that
they
recognized
us
however
and
were
anxious
that
they
should
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
find
a
clear
spot
in
the
jungle
from
which
to
signal
so
sergeant
lee
of
troop
k
climbed
a
tree
and
from
its
summit
waved
the
troop
guidon
they
waved
their
guidon
back
and
as
our
right
wing
was
now
in
touch
with
the
regulars
i
left
jenkins
and
to
keep
the
connection
and
led
llewellen
troop
back
to
the
path
to
join
the
rest
of
the
regiment
which
was
evidently
still
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
i
was
still
very
much
in
the
dark
as
to
where
the
main
body
of
the
spanish
forces
were
or
exactly
what
lines
the
battle
was
following
and
was
very
uncertain
what
i
ought
to
do
but
i
knew
it
could
not
be
wrong
to
go
forward
and
i
thought
i
would
find
wood
and
then
see
what
he
wished
me
to
do
i
was
in
a
mood
to
cordially
welcome
guidance
for
it
was
most
bewildering
to
fight
an
enemy
whom
one
so
rarely
saw
i
had
not
seen
wood
since
the
beginning
of
the
skirmish
when
he
hurried
forward
when
the
firing
opened
some
of
the
men
began
to
curse
do
swear
shoot
growled
wood
as
he
strode
along
the
path
leading
his
horse
and
everyone
laughed
and
became
cool
again
the
spanish
outposts
were
very
near
our
advance
guard
and
some
minutes
of
the
hottest
kind
of
firing
followed
before
they
were
driven
back
and
slipped
off
through
the
jungle
to
their
main
lines
in
the
rear
here
at
the
very
outset
of
our
active
service
we
suffered
the
loss
of
two
as
gallant
men
as
ever
wore
uniform
sergeant
hamilton
fish
at
the
extreme
front
while
holding
the
point
up
to
its
work
and
firing
back
where
the
spanish
advance
guards
lay
was
shot
and
instantly
killed
three
of
the
men
with
him
were
likewise
hit
captain
capron
leading
the
advance
guard
in
person
and
displaying
equal
courage
and
coolness
in
the
way
that
he
handled
them
was
also
struck
and
died
a
few
minutes
afterward
the
command
of
the
troop
then
devolved
upon
the
first
lieutenant
young
thomas
like
capron
thomas
was
the
fifth
in
line
from
father
to
son
who
had
served
in
the
american
army
though
in
his
case
it
was
in
the
volunteer
and
not
the
regular
service
the
four
preceding
generations
had
furnished
soldiers
respectively
to
the
revolutionary
war
the
war
of
the
mexican
war
and
the
civil
war
in
a
few
minutes
thomas
was
shot
through
the
leg
and
the
command
devolved
upon
the
second
lieutenant
day
a
nephew
of
albemarle
cushing
he
who
sunk
the
great
confederate
ram
day
who
proved
himself
to
be
one
of
our
most
efficient
officers
continued
to
handle
the
men
to
the
best
possible
advantage
and
brought
them
steadily
forward
l
troop
was
from
the
indian
territory
the
whites
indians
and
in
it
all
fought
with
equal
courage
captain
mcclintock
was
hurried
forward
to
its
relief
with
his
troop
b
of
arizona
men
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
shot
through
the
leg
and
his
place
was
taken
by
his
first
lieutenant
wilcox
who
handled
his
men
in
the
same
soldierly
manner
that
day
did
among
the
men
who
showed
marked
courage
and
coolness
was
the
tall
wright
the
colors
were
shot
through
three
times
when
i
had
led
g
troop
back
to
the
trail
i
ran
ahead
of
them
passing
the
dead
and
wounded
men
of
l
troop
passing
young
fish
as
he
lay
with
glazed
eyes
under
the
rank
tropic
growth
to
one
side
of
the
trail
when
i
came
to
the
front
i
found
the
men
spread
out
in
a
very
thin
skirmish
line
advancing
through
comparatively
open
ground
each
man
taking
advantage
of
what
cover
he
could
while
wood
strolled
about
leading
his
horse
brodie
being
close
at
hand
how
wood
escaped
being
hit
i
do
not
see
and
still
less
how
his
horse
escaped
i
had
left
mine
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
was
only
regretting
that
i
had
not
left
my
sword
with
it
as
it
kept
getting
between
my
legs
when
i
was
tearing
my
way
through
the
jungle
i
never
wore
it
again
in
action
lieutenant
rivers
was
with
wood
also
leading
his
horse
smedburg
had
been
sent
off
on
the
by
no
means
pleasant
task
of
establishing
communications
with
young
very
soon
after
i
reached
the
front
brodie
was
hit
the
bullet
shattering
one
arm
and
whirling
him
around
as
he
stood
he
had
kept
on
the
extreme
front
all
through
his
presence
and
example
keeping
his
men
entirely
steady
and
he
at
first
refused
to
go
to
the
rear
but
the
wound
was
very
painful
and
he
became
so
faint
that
he
had
to
be
sent
thereupon
wood
directed
me
to
take
charge
of
the
left
wing
in
brodie
place
and
to
bring
it
forward
so
over
i
went
i
now
had
under
me
captains
luna
muller
and
houston
and
i
began
to
take
them
forward
well
spread
out
through
the
high
grass
of
a
rather
open
forest
i
noticed
goodrich
of
houston
troop
tramping
along
behind
his
men
absorbed
in
making
them
keep
at
good
intervals
from
one
another
and
fire
slowly
with
careful
aim
as
i
came
close
up
to
the
edge
of
the
troop
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
me
mistook
me
for
one
of
his
own
skirmishers
who
was
crowding
in
too
closely
and
called
out
keep
your
interval
sir
keep
your
interval
and
go
forward
a
perfect
hail
of
bullets
was
sweeping
over
us
as
we
advanced
once
i
got
a
glimpse
of
some
spaniards
apparently
retreating
far
in
the
front
and
to
our
right
and
we
fired
a
couple
of
rounds
after
them
then
i
became
convinced
after
much
anxious
study
that
we
were
being
fired
at
from
some
large
buildings
part
of
a
ranch
on
our
front
smokeless
powder
and
the
thick
cover
in
our
front
continued
to
puzzle
us
and
i
more
than
once
consulted
anxiously
the
officers
as
to
the
exact
whereabouts
of
our
opponents
i
took
a
rifle
from
a
wounded
man
and
began
to
try
shots
with
it
myself
it
was
very
hot
and
the
men
were
getting
exhausted
though
at
this
particular
time
we
were
not
suffering
heavily
from
bullets
the
spanish
fire
going
high
as
we
advanced
the
cover
became
a
little
thicker
and
i
lost
touch
of
the
main
body
under
wood
so
i
halted
and
we
fired
industriously
at
the
ranch
buildings
ahead
of
us
some
five
hundred
yards
off
then
we
heard
cheering
on
the
right
and
i
supposed
that
this
meant
a
charge
on
the
part
of
wood
men
so
i
sprang
up
and
ordered
the
men
to
rush
the
buildings
ahead
of
us
they
came
forward
with
a
will
there
was
a
moment
heavy
firing
from
the
spaniards
which
all
went
over
our
heads
and
then
it
ceased
entirely
when
we
arrived
at
the
buildings
panting
and
out
of
breath
they
contained
nothing
but
heaps
of
empty
and
two
dead
spaniards
shot
through
the
head
the
country
all
around
us
was
thickly
forested
so
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
any
distance
in
any
direction
the
firing
had
now
died
out
but
i
was
still
entirely
uncertain
as
to
exactly
what
had
happened
i
did
not
know
whether
the
enemy
had
been
driven
back
or
whether
it
was
merely
a
lull
in
the
fight
and
we
might
be
attacked
again
nor
did
i
know
what
had
happened
in
any
other
part
of
the
line
while
as
i
occupied
the
extreme
left
i
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
my
flank
was
in
danger
at
this
moment
one
of
our
men
who
had
dropped
out
arrived
with
the
information
fortunately
false
that
wood
was
dead
of
course
this
meant
that
the
command
devolved
upon
me
and
i
hastily
set
about
taking
charge
of
the
regiment
i
had
been
particularly
struck
by
the
coolness
and
courage
shown
by
sergeants
dame
and
mcilhenny
and
sent
them
out
with
small
pickets
to
keep
watch
in
front
and
to
the
left
of
the
left
wing
i
sent
other
men
to
fill
the
canteens
with
water
and
threw
the
rest
out
in
a
long
line
in
a
disused
sunken
road
which
gave
them
cover
putting
two
or
three
wounded
men
who
had
hitherto
kept
up
with
the
and
a
dozen
men
who
were
suffering
from
heat
exhaustion
for
the
fighting
and
running
under
that
blazing
sun
through
the
thick
dry
jungle
was
into
the
ranch
buildings
then
i
started
over
toward
the
main
body
but
to
my
delight
encountered
wood
himself
who
told
me
the
fight
was
over
and
the
spaniards
had
retreated
he
also
informed
me
that
other
troops
were
just
coming
up
the
first
to
appear
was
a
squadron
of
the
ninth
cavalry
under
major
dimick
which
had
hurried
up
to
get
into
the
fight
and
was
greatly
disappointed
to
find
it
over
they
took
post
in
front
of
our
lines
so
that
our
tired
men
were
able
to
get
a
rest
captain
mcblain
of
the
ninth
giving
us
some
points
as
to
the
best
way
to
station
our
outposts
then
general
chaffee
rather
glum
at
not
having
been
in
the
fight
himself
rode
up
at
the
head
of
some
of
his
infantry
and
i
marched
my
squadron
back
to
where
the
rest
of
the
regiment
was
going
into
camp
just
where
the
two
trails
came
together
and
beyond
that
is
on
the
santiago
side
of
the
original
spanish
lines
the
rough
riders
had
lost
eight
men
killed
and
wounded
aside
from
two
or
three
who
were
merely
scratched
and
whose
wounds
were
not
reported
the
first
cavalry
white
lost
seven
men
killed
and
eight
wounded
the
tenth
cavalry
colored
one
man
killed
and
ten
wounded
so
out
of
men
engaged
on
our
side
were
killed
and
wounded
the
spaniards
were
under
general
rubin
with
as
second
in
command
colonel
alcarez
they
had
two
guns
and
eleven
companies
of
about
a
hundred
men
each
three
belonging
to
the
porto
rico
regiment
three
to
the
san
fernandino
two
to
the
talavero
two
being
mobilized
companies
from
the
mineral
districts
and
one
a
company
of
engineers
over
twelve
hundred
men
in
all
together
with
two
guns
note
see
lieutenant
muller
y
tejeiro
combates
y
capitulacion
de
santiago
de
cuba
page
the
lieutenant
speaks
as
if
only
one
echelon
of
seven
companies
and
two
guns
was
engaged
on
the
the
official
report
says
distinctly
general
rubin
column
which
consisted
of
the
companies
detailed
by
turning
to
page
where
lieutenant
tejeiro
enumerates
the
strength
of
the
various
companies
it
will
be
seen
that
they
averaged
over
men
apiece
this
probably
does
not
include
officers
and
is
probably
an
anyhow
on
page
he
makes
the
spanish
loss
at
las
guasimas
which
he
calls
sevilla
killed
and
wounded
very
possibly
he
includes
only
the
spanish
regulars
two
of
the
spaniards
we
slew
over
on
the
left
were
in
brown
instead
of
the
light
blue
of
the
regulars
and
were
doubtless
guerillas
general
rubin
reported
that
he
had
repulsed
the
american
attack
and
lieutenant
tejeiro
states
in
his
book
that
general
rubin
forced
the
americans
to
retreat
and
enumerates
the
attacking
force
as
consisting
of
three
regular
regiments
of
infantry
the
second
massachusetts
and
the
new
york
not
one
of
which
fired
a
gun
or
were
anywhere
near
the
battle
in
addition
to
the
sixteen
dismounted
troops
of
cavalry
in
other
words
as
the
five
infantry
regiments
each
included
twelve
companies
he
makes
the
attacking
force
consist
of
just
five
times
the
actual
amount
as
for
the
repulse
our
line
never
went
back
ten
yards
in
any
place
and
the
advance
was
practically
steady
while
an
hour
and
a
half
after
the
fight
began
we
were
in
complete
possession
of
the
entire
spanish
position
and
their
troops
were
fleeing
in
masses
down
the
road
our
men
being
too
exhausted
to
follow
them
general
rubin
also
reports
that
he
lost
but
seven
men
killed
this
is
certainly
incorrect
for
captain
and
i
went
over
the
ground
very
carefully
and
counted
eleven
dead
spaniards
all
of
whom
were
actually
buried
by
our
burying
squads
there
were
probably
two
or
three
men
whom
we
missed
but
i
think
that
our
official
reports
are
incorrect
in
stating
that
dead
spaniards
were
found
this
being
based
upon
reports
in
which
i
think
some
of
the
spanish
dead
were
counted
two
or
three
times
indeed
i
should
doubt
whether
their
loss
was
as
heavy
as
ours
for
they
were
under
cover
while
we
advanced
often
in
the
open
and
their
main
lines
fled
long
before
we
could
get
to
close
quarters
it
was
a
very
difficult
country
and
a
force
of
good
soldiers
resolutely
handled
could
have
held
the
pass
with
ease
against
two
or
three
times
their
number
as
it
was
with
a
force
half
of
regulars
and
half
of
volunteers
we
drove
out
a
superior
number
of
spanish
regular
troops
strongly
posted
without
suffering
a
very
heavy
loss
although
the
spanish
fire
was
very
heavy
it
does
not
seem
to
me
it
was
very
well
directed
and
though
they
fired
with
great
spirit
while
we
merely
stood
at
a
distance
and
fired
at
them
they
did
not
show
much
resolution
and
when
we
advanced
always
went
back
long
before
there
was
any
chance
of
our
coming
into
contact
with
them
our
men
behaved
very
well
indeed
white
regulars
colored
regulars
and
rough
riders
alike
the
newspaper
press
failed
to
do
full
justice
to
the
white
regulars
in
my
opinion
from
the
simple
reason
that
everybody
knew
that
they
would
fight
whereas
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
question
as
to
how
the
rough
riders
who
were
volunteer
troops
and
the
tenth
cavalry
who
were
colored
would
behave
so
there
was
a
tendency
to
exalt
our
deeds
at
the
expense
of
those
of
the
first
regulars
whose
courage
and
good
conduct
were
taken
for
granted
it
was
a
trying
fight
beyond
what
the
losses
show
for
it
is
hard
upon
raw
soldiers
to
be
pitted
against
an
unseen
foe
and
to
advance
steadily
when
their
comrades
are
falling
around
them
and
when
they
can
only
occasionally
see
a
chance
to
retaliate
wood
experience
in
fighting
apaches
stood
him
in
good
stead
an
entirely
raw
man
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
conducting
as
wood
was
what
was
practically
an
independent
fight
would
have
been
in
a
very
trying
position
the
fight
cleared
the
way
toward
santiago
and
we
experienced
no
further
resistance
that
afternoon
we
made
camp
and
dined
subsisting
chiefly
on
a
load
of
beans
which
we
found
on
one
of
the
spanish
mules
which
had
been
shot
we
also
looked
after
the
wounded
church
had
himself
gone
out
to
the
during
the
fight
and
carried
to
the
rear
some
of
the
worst
wounded
on
his
back
or
in
his
arms
those
who
could
walk
had
walked
in
to
where
the
little
of
the
regiment
was
established
on
the
trail
we
found
all
our
dead
and
all
the
badly
wounded
around
one
of
the
latter
the
big
hideous
had
gathered
in
a
gruesome
ring
waiting
for
life
to
be
extinct
one
of
our
own
men
and
most
of
the
spanish
dead
had
been
found
by
the
vultures
before
we
got
to
them
and
their
bodies
were
mangled
the
eyes
and
wounds
being
torn
the
rough
rider
who
had
been
thus
treated
was
in
bucky
troop
and
as
we
looked
at
the
body
turned
to
me
and
asked
colonel
is
it
whitman
who
says
of
the
vultures
that
pluck
the
eyes
of
princes
and
tear
the
flesh
of
kings
i
answered
that
i
could
not
place
the
quotation
just
a
week
afterward
we
were
shielding
his
own
body
from
the
birds
of
prey
one
of
the
men
who
fired
first
and
who
displayed
conspicuous
gallantry
was
a
cherokee
who
was
hit
seven
times
and
of
course
had
to
go
back
to
the
states
before
he
rejoined
us
at
montauk
point
he
had
gone
through
a
little
private
war
of
his
own
for
on
his
return
he
found
that
a
cowboy
had
gone
off
with
his
sweetheart
and
in
the
fight
that
ensued
he
shot
his
rival
another
man
of
l
troop
who
also
showed
marked
gallantry
was
elliot
cowdin
the
men
of
the
plains
and
mountains
were
trained
by
habit
to
look
on
life
and
death
with
iron
philosophy
as
i
passed
by
a
couple
of
tall
lank
oklahoma
i
heard
one
say
well
some
of
the
boys
got
it
in
the
neck
to
which
the
other
answered
with
the
grim
plains
proverb
of
the
south
many
a
good
horse
dies
thomas
isbell
a
cherokee
in
the
squad
under
hamilton
fish
was
among
the
first
to
shoot
and
be
shot
at
he
was
wounded
no
less
than
seven
times
the
first
wound
was
received
by
him
two
minutes
after
he
had
fired
his
first
shot
the
bullet
going
through
his
neck
the
second
hit
him
in
the
left
thumb
the
third
struck
near
his
right
hip
passing
entirely
through
the
body
the
fourth
bullet
which
was
apparently
from
a
remington
and
not
from
a
mauser
went
into
his
neck
and
lodged
against
the
bone
being
afterward
cut
out
the
fifth
bullet
again
hit
his
left
hand
the
sixth
scraped
his
head
and
the
seventh
his
neck
he
did
not
receive
all
of
the
wounds
at
the
same
time
over
half
an
hour
elapsing
between
the
first
and
the
last
up
to
receiving
the
last
wound
he
had
declined
to
leave
the
but
by
that
time
he
had
lost
so
much
blood
that
he
had
to
be
sent
to
the
rear
the
man
wiry
toughness
was
as
notable
as
his
courage
we
improvised
litters
and
carried
the
more
sorely
wounded
back
to
siboney
that
afternoon
and
the
next
morning
the
others
walked
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
most
severely
wounded
was
edward
marshall
the
correspondent
and
he
showed
as
much
heroism
as
any
soldier
in
the
whole
army
he
was
shot
through
the
spine
a
terrible
and
very
painful
wound
which
we
supposed
meant
that
he
would
surely
die
but
he
made
no
complaint
of
any
kind
and
while
he
retained
consciousness
persisted
in
dictating
the
story
of
the
fight
a
very
touching
incident
happened
in
the
improvised
hospital
after
the
fight
where
the
wounded
were
lying
they
did
not
groan
and
made
no
complaint
trying
to
help
one
another
one
of
them
suddenly
began
to
hum
my
country
is
of
thee
and
one
by
one
the
others
joined
in
the
chorus
which
swelled
out
through
the
tropic
woods
where
the
victors
lay
in
camp
beside
their
dead
i
did
not
see
any
sign
among
the
fighting
men
whether
wounded
or
unwounded
of
the
very
complicated
emotions
assigned
to
their
kind
by
some
of
the
realistic
modern
novelists
who
have
written
about
battles
at
the
front
everyone
behaved
quite
simply
and
took
things
as
they
came
in
a
way
but
there
was
doubtless
as
is
always
the
case
a
good
deal
of
panic
and
confusion
in
the
rear
where
the
wounded
the
stragglers
a
few
of
the
packers
and
two
or
three
newspaper
correspondents
were
and
in
consequence
the
first
reports
sent
back
to
the
coast
were
of
a
most
alarming
character
describing
with
minute
inaccuracy
how
we
had
run
into
ambush
etc
the
packers
with
the
mules
which
carried
the
guns
were
among
those
who
ran
and
they
let
the
mules
go
in
the
jungle
in
consequence
the
guns
were
never
even
brought
to
the
and
only
fred
herrig
skill
as
a
trailer
enabled
us
to
recover
them
by
patient
work
he
followed
up
the
mules
tracks
in
the
forest
until
he
found
the
animals
among
the
wounded
who
walked
to
the
temporary
hospital
at
siboney
was
the
trooper
rowland
of
whom
i
spoke
before
there
the
doctors
examined
him
and
decreed
that
his
wound
was
so
serious
that
he
must
go
back
to
the
states
this
was
enough
for
rowland
who
waited
until
nightfall
and
then
escaped
slipping
out
of
the
window
and
making
his
way
back
to
camp
with
his
rifle
and
pack
though
his
wound
must
have
made
all
movement
very
painful
to
him
after
this
we
felt
that
he
was
entitled
to
stay
and
he
never
left
us
for
a
day
distinguishing
himself
again
in
the
fight
at
san
juan
next
morning
we
buried
seven
dead
rough
riders
in
a
grave
on
the
summit
of
the
trail
chaplain
brown
reading
the
solemn
burial
service
of
the
episcopalians
while
the
men
stood
around
with
bared
heads
and
joined
in
singing
rock
of
ages
vast
numbers
of
vultures
were
wheeling
round
and
round
in
great
circles
through
the
blue
sky
overhead
there
could
be
no
more
honorable
burial
than
that
of
these
men
in
a
common
grave
indian
and
cowboy
miner
packer
and
college
athlete
the
man
of
unknown
ancestry
from
the
lonely
western

and
the
man
who
carried
on
his
watch
the
crests
of
the
stuyvesants
and
the
fishes
one
in
the
way
they
had
met
death
just
as
during
life
they
had
been
one
in
their
daring
and
their
loyalty
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
moved
on
a
couple
of
miles
and
camped
in
a
marshy
open
spot
close
to
a
beautiful
stream
here
we
lay
for
several
days
captain
lee
the
british
attache
spent
some
time
with
us
we
had
begun
to
regard
him
as
almost
a
member
of
the
regiment
count
von
gotzen
the
german
attache
another
good
fellow
also
visited
us
general
young
was
struck
down
with

of
the
brigade
this
left
me
in
command
of
the
regiment
of
which
i
was
very
glad
for
such
experience
as
we
had
had
is
a
quick
teacher
by
this
time
the
men
and
i
knew
one
another
and
i
felt
able
to
make
them
do
themselves
justice
in
march
or
battle
they
understood
that
i
paid
no
heed
to
where
they
came
from
no
heed
to
their
creed
politics
or
social
standing
that
i
would
care
for
them
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
but
that
i
demanded
the
highest
performance
of
duty
while
in
return
i
had
seen
them
tested
and
knew
i
could
depend
absolutely
on
their
courage
hardihood
obedience
and
individual
initiative
there
was
nothing
like
enough
transportation
with
the
army
whether
in
the
way
of
wagons
or
exactly
as
there
had
been
no
sufficient
number
of
with
the
transports
the
baggage
had
come
up
but
none
of
us
had
much
and
the
proved
only
a
partial
protection
against
the
terrific
downpours
of
rain
these
occurred
almost
every
afternoon
and
turned
the
camp
into
a
tarn
and
the
trails
into
torrents
and
quagmires
we
were
not
given
quite
the
proper
amount
of
food
and
what
we
did
get
like
most
of
the
clothing
issued
us
was
fitter
for
the
klondyke
than
for
cuba
we
got
enough
salt
pork
and
hardtack
for
the
men
but
not
the
full
ration
of
coffee
and
sugar
and
nothing
else
i
organized
a
couple
of
expeditions
back
to
the
seacoast
taking
the
strongest
and
best
walkers
and
also
some
of
the
officers
horses
and
a
stray
mule
or
two
and
brought
back
beans
and
canned
tomatoes
these
i
got
partly
by
great
exertions
on
my
part
and
partly
by
the
aid
of
colonel
weston
of
the
commissary
department
a
particularly
energetic
man
whose
services
were
of
great
value
a
silly
regulation
forbade
my
purchasing
canned
vegetables
except
for
the
officers
and
i
had
no
little
difficulty
in
getting
round
this
regulation
and
purchasing
with
my
own
money
of
course
what
i
needed
for
the
men
one
of
the
men
i
took
with
me
on
one
of
these
trips
was
sherman
bell
the
former
deputy
marshal
of
cripple
creek
and
express
rider
in
coming
home
with
his
load
through
a
blinding
storm
he
slipped
and
opened
the
old
rupture
the
agony
was
very
great
and
one
of
his
comrades
took
his
load
he
himself
sometimes
walking
and
sometimes
crawling
got
back
to
camp
where
church
fixed
him
up
with
a
spike
bandage
but
informed
him
that
he
would
have
to
be
sent
back
to
the
states
when
an
ambulance
came
along
the
ambulance
did
not
come
until
the
next
day
which
was
the
day
before
we
marched
to
san
juan
it
arrived
after
nightfall
and
as
soon
as
bell
heard
it
coming
he
crawled
out
of
the
hospital
tent
into
the
jungle
where
he
lay
all
night
and
the
ambulance
went
off
without
him
the
men
shielded
him
just
as
would
shield
a
companion
carrying
his
gun
belt
and
bedding
while
bell
kept
out
of
sight
until
the
column
started
and
then
staggered
along
behind
it
i
found
him
the
morning
of
the
san
juan
fight
he
told
me
that
he
wanted
to
die
fighting
if
die
he
must
and
i
had
the
heart
to
send
him
back
he
did
splendid
service
that
day
and
afterward
in
the
trenches
and
though
the
rupture
opened
twice
again
and
on
each
occasion
he
was
within
a
hair
breadth
of
death
he
escaped
and
came
back
with
us
to
the
united
states
the
army
was
camped
along
the
valley
ahead
of
and
behind
us
our
outposts
being
established
on
either
side
from
the
generals
to
the
privates
all
were
eager
to
march
against
santiago
at
daybreak
when
the
tall
palms
began
to
show
dimly
through
the
rising
mist
the
scream
of
the
cavalry
trumpets
tore
the
tropic
dawn
and
in
the
evening
as
the
bands
of
regiment
after
regiment
played
the
banner
all
officers
and
men
alike
stood
with
heads
uncovered
wherever
they
were
until
the
last
strains
of
the
anthem
died
away
in
the
hot
sunset
air
iv
the
cavalry
at
santiago
on
june
we
received
orders
to
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
to
march
against
santiago
and
all
the
men
were
greatly
overjoyed
for
the
inaction
was
trying
the
one
narrow
road
a
mere
muddy
track
along
which
the
army
was
encamped
was
choked
with
the
marching
columns
as
always
happened
when
we
had
to
change
camp
everything
that
the
men
could
not
carry
including
of
course
the
officers
baggage
was
left
behind
about
noon
the
rough
riders
struck
camp
and
drew
up
in
column
beside
the
road
in
the
rear
of
the
first
cavalry
then
we
sat
down
and
waited
for
hours
before
the
order
came
to
march
while
regiment
after
regiment
passed
by
varied
by
bands
of
tatterdemalion
cuban
insurgents
and
by
with
ammunition
every
man
carried
three
days
provisions
we
had
succeeded
in
borrowing
mules
sufficient
to
carry
along
the
dynamite
gun
and
the
automatic
colts
at
last
toward
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
ahead
of
us
marched
and
we
followed
the
first
was
under
the
command
of
veile
the
tenth
under
baldwin
every
few
minutes
there
would
be
a
stoppage
in
front
and
at
the
halt
i
would
make
the
men
sit
or
lie
down
beside
the
track
loosening
their
packs
the
heat
was
intense
as
we
passed
through
the
still
close
jungle
which
formed
a
wall
on
either
hand
occasionally
we
came
to
gaps
or
open
spaces
where
some
regiment
was
camped
and
now
and
then
one
of
these
regiments
which
apparently
had
been
left
out
of
its
proper
place
would
file
into
the
road
breaking
up
our
line
of
march
as
a
result
we
finally
found
ourselves
following
merely
the
tail
of
the
regiment
ahead
of
us
an
infantry
regiment
being
thrust
into
the
interval
once
or
twice
we
had
to
wade
streams
darkness
came
on
but
we
still
continued
to
march
it
was
about
eight
when
we
turned
to
the
left
and
climbed
el
poso
hill
on
whose
summit
there
was
a
ruined
ranch
and
sugar
factory
now
of
course
deserted
here
i
found
general
wood
who
was
arranging
for
the
camping
of
the
brigade
our
own
arrangements
for
the
night
were
simple
i
extended
each
troop
across
the
road
into
the
jungle
and
then
the
men
threw
down
their
belongings
where
they
stood
and
slept
on
their
arms
fortunately
there
was
no
rain
wood
and
i
curled
up
under
our
on
the
while
his
two
aides
captain
mills
and
lieutenant
ship
slept
near
us
we
were
up
before
dawn
and
getting
breakfast
mills
and
ship
had
nothing
to
eat
and
they
breakfasted
with
wood
and
myself
as
we
had
been
able
to
get
some
handfuls
of
beans
and
some
coffee
and
sugar
as
well
as
the
ordinary
bacon
and
hardtack
we
did
not
talk
much
for
though
we
were
in
ignorance
as
to
precisely
what
the
day
would
bring
forth
we
knew
that
we
should
see
fighting
we
had
slept
soundly
enough
although
of
course
both
wood
and
i
during
the
night
had
made
a
round
of
the
sentries
he
of
the
brigade
and
i
of
the
regiment
and
i
suppose
that
excepting
among
hardened
veterans
there
is
always
a
certain
feeling
of
uneasy
excitement
the
night
before
the
battle
mills
and
ship
were
both
tall
men
of
tried
courage
and
thoroughly
trained
in
every
detail
of
their
profession
i
remember
being
struck
by
the
quiet
soldierly
way
they
were
going
about
their
work
early
that
morning
before
noon
one
was
killed
and
the
other
dangerously
wounded
general
wheeler
was
sick
but
with
his
usual
indomitable
pluck
and
entire
indifference
to
his
own
personal
comfort
he
kept
to
the
front
he
was
unable
to
retain
command
of
the
cavalry
division
which
accordingly
devolved
upon
general
samuel
sumner
who
commanded
it
until
when
the
bulk
of
the
fighting
was
over
general
sumner
own
brigade
fell
to
colonel
henry
carroll
general
sumner
led
the
advance
with
the
cavalry
and
the
battle
was
fought
by
him
and
by
general
kent
who
commanded
the
infantry
division
and
whose
foremost
brigade
was
led
by
general
hawkins
as
the
sun
rose
the
men
fell
in
and
at
the
same
time
a
battery
of
was
brought
up
on
the
just
beyond
between
us
and
toward
santiago
it
was
a
fine
sight
to
see
the
great
horses
straining
under
the
lash
as
they
whirled
the
guns
up
the
hill
and
into
position
our
brigade
was
drawn
up
on
the
hither
side
of
a
kind
of
half
basin
a
big
band
of
cubans
being
off
to
the
left
as
yet
we
had
received
no
orders
except
that
we
were
told
that
the
main
fighting
was
to
be
done
by
lawton
infantry
division
which
was
to
take
el
caney
several
miles
to
our
right
while
we
were
simply
to
make
a
diversion
this
diversion
was
to
be
made
mainly
with
the
artillery
and
the
battery
which
had
taken
position
immediately
in
front
of
us
was
to
begin
when
lawton
began
it
was
about
six
that
the
first
report
of
the
cannon
from
el
caney
came
booming
to
us
across
the
miles
of
still
jungle
it
was
a
very
lovely
morning
the
sky
of
cloudless
blue
while
the
level
shimmering
rays
from
the
sun
brought
into
fine
relief
the
splendid
palms
which
here
and
there
towered
above
the
lower
growth
the
lofty
and
beautiful
mountains
hemmed
in
the
santiago
plain
making
it
an
amphitheatre
for
the
battle
immediately
our
guns
opened
and
at
the
report
great
clouds
of
white
smoke
hung
on
the
ridge
crest
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
response
wood
and
i
were
sitting
together
and
wood
remarked
to
me
that
he
wished
our
brigade
could
be
moved
somewhere
else
for
we
were
directly
in
line
of
any
return
fire
aimed
by
the
spaniards
at
the
battery
hardly
had
he
spoken
when
there
was
a
peculiar
whistling
singing
sound
in
the
air
and
immediately
afterward
the
noise
of
something
exploding
over
our
heads
it
was
shrapnel
from
the
spanish
batteries
we
sprung
to
our
feet
and
leaped
on
our
horses
immediately
afterward
a
second
shot
came
which
burst
directly
above
us
and
then
a
third
from
the
second
shell
one
of
the
shrapnel
bullets
dropped
on
my
wrist
hardly
breaking
the
skin
but
raising
a
bump
about
as
big
as
a
the
same
shell
wounded
four
of
my
regiment
one
of
them
being
mason
mitchell
and
two
or
three
of
the
regulars
were
also
hit
one
losing
his
leg
by
a
great
fragment
of
shell
another
shell
exploded
right
in
the
middle
of
the
cubans
killing
and
wounding
a
good
many
while
the
remainder
scattered
like
wood
lead
horse
was
also
shot
through
the
lungs
i
at
once
hustled
my
regiment
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
into
the
thick
underbrush
where
i
had
no
little
difficulty
in
getting
them
together
again
into
column
meanwhile
the
firing
continued
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
until
it
gradually
died
away
as
the
spaniards
used
smokeless
powder
their
artillery
had
an
enormous
advantage
over
ours
and
moreover
we
did
not
have
the
best
type
of
modern
guns
our
fire
being
slow
as
soon
as
the
firing
ceased
wood
formed
his
brigade
with
my
regiment
in
front
and
gave
me
orders
to
follow
behind
the
first
brigade
which
was
just
moving
off
the
ground
in
column
of
fours
we
marched
down
the
trail
toward
the
ford
of
the
san
juan
river
we
passed
two
or
three
regiments
of
infantry
and
were
several
times
halted
before
we
came
to
the
ford
the
first
brigade
which
was
under
colonel
carroll
hamilton
commanding
the
ninth
regiment
major
wessels
the
third
and
captain
kerr
the
sixth
had
already
crossed
and
was
marching
to
the
right
parallel
to
but
a
little
distance
from
the
river
the
spaniards
in
the
trenches
and
on
top
of
the
hills
in
front
were
already
firing
at
the
brigade
in
desultory
fashion
the
extreme
advance
of
the
ninth
cavalry
was
under
lieutenants
mcnamee
and
hartwick
they
were
joined
by
general
hawkins
with
his
staff
who
was
looking
over
the
ground
and
deciding
on
the
route
he
should
take
his
infantry
brigade
our
orders
had
been
of
the
vaguest
kind
being
simply
to
march
to
the
right
and
connect
with
lawton
with
whom
of
course
there
was
no
chance
of
our
connecting
no
reconnaissance
had
been
made
and
the
exact
position
and
strength
of
the
spaniards
was
not
known
a
captive
balloon
was
up
in
the
air
at
this
moment
but
it
was
worse
than
useless
a
previous
proper
reconnaissance
and
proper
from
the
hills
would
have
given
us
exact
information
as
it
was
generals
kent
sumner
and
hawkins
had
to
be
their
own
reconnaissance
and
they
fought
their
troops
so
well
that
we
won
anyhow
i
was
now
ordered
to
cross
the
ford
march
half
a
mile
or
so
to
the
right
and
then
halt
and
await
further
orders
and
i
promptly
hurried
my
men
across
for
the
fire
was
getting
hot
and
the
captive
balloon
to
the
horror
of
everybody
was
coming
down
to
the
ford
of
course
it
was
a
special
target
for
the
enemy
fire
i
got
my
men
across
before
it
reached
the
ford
there
it
partly
collapsed
and
remained
causing
severe
loss
of
life
as
it
indicated
the
exact
position
where
the
tenth
and
the
first
cavalry
and
the
infantry
were
crossing
as
i
led
my
column
slowly
along
under
the
intense
heat
through
the
high
grass
of
the
open
jungle
the
first
brigade
was
to
our
left
and
the
firing
between
it
and
the
spaniards
on
the
hills
grew
steadily
hotter
and
hotter
after
awhile
i
came
to
a
sunken
lane
and
as
by
this
time
the
first
brigade
had
stopped
and
was
engaged
in
a
fight
i
halted
my
men
and
sent
back
word
for
orders
as
we
faced
toward
the
spanish
hills
my
regiment
was
on
the
right
with
next
to
it
and
a
little
in
advance
the
first
cavalry
and
behind
them
the
tenth
in
our
front
the
ninth
held
the
right
the
sixth
the
centre
and
the
third
the
left
but
in
the
jungle
the
lines
were
already
overlapping
in
places
kent
infantry
were
coming
up
farther
to
the
left
captain
mills
was
with
me
the
sunken
lane
which
had
a
wire
fence
on
either
side
led
straight
up
toward
and
between
the
two
hills
in
our
front
the
hill
on
the
left
which
contained
heavy
being
farther
away
from
us
than
the
hill
on
our
right
which
we
afterward
grew
to
call
kettle
hill
and
which
was
surmounted
merely
by
some
large
ranch
buildings
or
haciendas
with
sunken
walls
and
cellars
i
got
the
men
as
as
i
could
many
of
them
lay
close
under
the
bank
of
the
lane
others
slipped
into
the
san
juan
river
and
crouched
under
its
hither
bank
while
the
rest
lay
down
behind
the
patches
of
bushy
jungle
in
the
tall
grass
the
heat
was
intense
and
many
of
the
men
were
already
showing
signs
of
exhaustion
the
sides
of
the
hills
in
front
were
bare
but
the
country
up
to
them
was
for
the
most
part
covered
with
such
dense
jungle
that
in
charging
through
it
no
accuracy
of
formation
could
possibly
be
preserved
the
fight
was
now
on
in
good
earnest
and
the
spaniards
on
the
hills
were
engaged
in
heavy
volley
firing
the
mauser
bullets
drove
in
sheets
through
the
trees
and
the
tall
jungle
grass
making
a
peculiar
whirring
or
rustling
sound
some
of
the
bullets
seemed
to
pop
in
the
air
so
that
we
thought
they
were
explosive
and
indeed
many
of
those
which
were
coated
with
brass
did
explode
in
the
sense
that
the
brass
coat
was
ripped
off
making
a
thin
plate
of
hard
metal
with
a
jagged
edge
which
inflicted
a
ghastly
wound
these
bullets
were
shot
from
a
rifle
carrying
smokeless
powder
which
was
much
used
by
the
guerillas
and
irregular
spanish
troops
the
mauser
bullets
themselves
made
a
small
clean
hole
with
the
result
that
the
wound
healed
in
a
most
astonishing
manner
one
or
two
of
our
men
who
were
shot
in
the
head
had
the
skull
blown
open
but
elsewhere
the
wounds
from
the
minute
bullet
with
its
very
high
velocity
were
certainly
nothing
like
as
serious
as
those
made
by
the
old
rifle
if
a
man
was
shot
through
the
heart
spine
or
brain
he
was
of
course
killed
instantly
but
very
few
of
the
wounded
died
even
under
the
appalling
conditions
which
prevailed
owing
to
the
lack
of
attendance
and
supplies
in
the
with
the
army
while
we
were
lying
in
reserve
we
were
suffering
nearly
as
much
as
afterward
when
we
charged
i
think
that
the
bulk
of
the
spanish
fire
was
practically
unaimed
or
at
least
not
aimed
at
any
particular
man
and
only
occasionally
at
a
particular
body
of
men
but
they
swept
the
whole
field
of
battle
up
to
the
edge
of
the
river
and
man
after
man
in
our
ranks
fell
dead
or
wounded
although
i
had
the
troopers
scattered
out
far
apart
taking
advantage
of
every
scrap
of
cover
devereux
was
dangerously
shot
while
he
lay
with
his
men
on
the
edge
of
the
river
a
young
west
point
cadet
ernest
haskell
who
had
taken
his
holiday
with
us
as
an
acting
second
lieutenant
was
shot
through
the
stomach
he
had
shown
great
coolness
and
gallantry
which
he
displayed
to
an
even
more
marked
degree
after
being
wounded
shaking
my
hand
and
saying
all
right
colonel
i
going
to
get
well
bother
about
me
and
do
let
any
man
come
away
with
me
when
i
shook
hands
with
him
i
thought
he
would
surely
die
yet
he
recovered
the
most
serious
loss
that
i
and
the
regiment
could
have
suffered
befell
just
before
we
charged
bucky
was
strolling
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
men
smoking
his
cigarette
for
he
was
inveterately
addicted
to
the
habit
he
had
a
theory
that
an
officer
ought
never
to
take
cover
a
theory
which
was
of
course
wrong
though
in
a
volunteer
organization
the
officers
should
certainly
expose
themselves
very
fully
simply
for
the
effect
on
the
men
our
regimental
toast
on
the
transport
running
the
officers
may
the
war
last
until
each
is
killed
wounded
or
promoted
as
moved
to
and
fro
his
men
begged
him
to
lie
down
and
one
of
the
sergeants
said
captain
a
bullet
is
sure
to
hit
you
took
his
cigarette
out
of
his
mouth
and
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
laughed
and
said
sergeant
the
spanish
bullet
is
made
that
will
kill
me
a
little
later
he
discussed
for
a
moment
with
one
of
the
regular
officers
the
direction
from
which
the
spanish
fire
was
coming
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
a
bullet
struck
him
in
the
mouth
and
came
out
at
the
back
of
his
head
so
that
even
before
he
fell
his
wild
and
gallant
soul
had
gone
out
into
the
darkness
my
orderly
was
a
brave
young
harvard
boy
sanders
from
the
quaint
old
massachusetts
town
of
salem
the
work
of
an
orderly
on
foot
under
the
blazing
sun
through
the
hot
and
matted
jungle
was
very
severe
and
finally
the
heat
overcame
him
he
dropped
nor
did
he
ever
recover
fully
and
later
he
died
from
fever
in
his
place
i
summoned
a
trooper
whose
name
i
did
not
know
shortly
afterward
while
sitting
beside
the
bank
i
directed
him
to
go
back
and
ask
whatever
general
he
came
across
if
i
could
not
advance
as
my
men
were
being
much
cut
up
he
stood
up
to
salute
and
then
pitched
forward
across
my
knees
a
bullet
having
gone
through
his
throat
cutting
the
carotid
when
was
shot
his
troop
who
were
devoted
to
him
were
for
the
moment
at
a
loss
whom
to
follow
one
of
their
number
henry
bardshar
a
huge
arizona
miner
immediately
attached
himself
to
me
as
my
orderly
and
from
that
moment
he
was
closer
to
me
not
only
in
the
fight
but
throughout
the
rest
of
the
campaign
than
any
other
man
not
even
excepting
the
wright
captain
mills
was
with
me
gallant
ship
had
already
been
killed
mills
was
an
invaluable
aide
absolutely
cool
absolutely
unmoved
or
flurried
in
any
way
i
sent
messenger
after
messenger
to
try
to
find
general
sumner
or
general
wood
and
get
permission
to
advance
and
was
just
about
making
up
my
mind
that
in
the
absence
of
orders
i
had
better
march
toward
the
guns
when
dorst
came
riding
up
through
the
storm
of
bullets
with
the
welcome
command
to
move
forward
and
support
the
regulars
in
the
assault
on
the
hills
in
front
general
sumner
had
obtained
authority
to
advance
from
lieutenant
miley
who
was
representing
general
shafter
at
the
front
and
was
in
the
thick
of
the
fire
the
general
at
once
ordered
the
first
brigade
to
advance
on
the
hills
and
the
second
to
support
it
he
himself
was
riding
his
horse
along
the
lines
superintending
the
fight
later
i
overheard
a
couple
of
my
men
talking
together
about
him
what
they
said
illustrates
the
value
of
a
display
of
courage
among
the
officers
in
hardening
their
soldiers
for
their
theme
was
how
as
they
were
lying
down
under
a
fire
which
they
could
not
return
and
were
in
consequence
feeling
rather
nervous
general
sumner
suddenly
appeared
on
horseback
sauntering
by
quite
unmoved
and
said
one
of
the
men
that
made
us
feel
all
right
if
the
general
could
stand
it
we
could
the
instant
i
received
the
order
i
sprang
on
my
horse
and
then
my
crowded
hour
began
the
guerillas
had
been
shooting
at
us
from
the
edges
of
the
jungle
and
from
their
perches
in
the
leafy
trees
and
as
they
used
smokeless
powder
it
was
almost
impossible
to
see
them
though
a
few
of
my
men
had
from
time
to
time
responded
we
had
also
suffered
from
the
hill
on
our
right
front
which
was
held
chiefly
by
guerillas
although
there
were
also
some
spanish
regulars
with
them
for
we
found
their
dead
i
formed
my
men
in
column
of
troops
each
troop
extended
in
open
skirmishing
order
the
right
resting
on
the
wire
fences
which
bordered
the
sunken
lane
captain
jenkins
led
the
first
squadron
his
eyes
literally
dancing
with
joyous
excitement
i
started
in
the
rear
of
the
regiment
the
position
in
which
the
colonel
should
theoretically
stay
captain
mills
and
captain
mccormick
were
both
with
me
as
aides
but
i
speedily
had
to
send
them
off
on
special
duty
in
getting
the
different
bodies
of
men
forward
i
had
intended
to
go
into
action
on
foot
as
at
las
guasimas
but
the
heat
was
so
oppressive
that
i
found
i
should
be
quite
unable
to
run
up
and
down
the
line
and
superintend
matters
unless
i
was
mounted
and
moreover
when
on
horseback
i
could
see
the
men
better
and
they
could
see
me
better
a
curious
incident
happened
as
i
was
getting
the
men
started
forward
always
when
men
have
been
lying
down
under
cover
for
some
time
and
are
required
to
advance
there
is
a
little
hesitation
each
looking
to
see
whether
the
others
are
going
forward
as
i
rode
down
the
line
calling
to
the
troopers
to
go
forward
and
rasping
brief
directions
to
the
captains
and
lieutenants
i
came
upon
a
man
lying
behind
a
little
bush
and
i
ordered
him
to
jump
up
i
do
not
think
he
understood
that
we
were
making
a
forward
move
and
he
looked
up
at
me
for
a
moment
with
hesitation
and
i
again
bade
him
rise
jeering
him
and
saying
are
you
afraid
to
stand
up
when
i
am
on
horseback
as
i
spoke
he
suddenly
fell
forward
on
his
face
a
bullet
having
struck
him
and
gone
through
him
lengthwise
i
suppose
the
bullet
had
been
aimed
at
me
at
any
rate
i
who
was
on
horseback
in
the
open
was
unhurt
and
the
man
lying
flat
on
the
ground
in
the
cover
beside
me
was
killed
there
were
several
pairs
of
brothers
with
us
of
the
two
nortons
one
was
killed
of
the
two
mccurdys
one
was
wounded
i
soon
found
that
i
could
get
that
line
behind
which
i
personally
was
faster
forward
than
the
one
immediately
in
front
of
it
with
the
result
that
the
two
rearmost
lines
of
the
regiment
began
to
crowd
together
so
i
rode
through
them
both
the
better
to
move
on
the
one
in
front
this
happened
with
every
line
in
succession
until
i
found
myself
at
the
head
of
the
regiment
both
lieutenants
of
b
troop
from
arizona
had
been
exerting
themselves
greatly
and
both
were
overcome
by
the
heat
but
sergeants
campbell
and
davidson
took
it
forward
in
splendid
shape
some
of
the
men
from
this
troop
and
from
the
other
arizona
troop
bucky
joined
me
as
a
kind
of
fighting
tail
the
ninth
regiment
was
immediately
in
front
of
me
and
the
first
on
my
left
and
these
went
up
kettle
hill
with
my
regiment
the
third
sixth
and
tenth
went
partly
up
kettle
hill
following
the
rough
riders
and
the
ninth
and
first
and
partly
between
that
and
the
hill
which
the
infantry
were
assailing
general
sumner
in
person
gave
the
tenth
the
order
to
charge
the
hills
and
it
went
forward
at
a
rapid
gait
the
three
regiments
went
forward
more
or
less
intermingled
advancing
steadily
and
keeping
up
a
heavy
fire
up
kettle
hill
sergeant
george
berry
of
the
tenth
bore
not
only
his
own
regimental
colors
but
those
of
the
third
the
of
the
third
having
been
shot
down
he
kept
shouting
dress
on
the
colors
boys
dress
on
the
colors
as
he
followed
captain
ayres
who
was
running
in
advance
of
his
men
shouting
and
waving
his
hat
the
tenth
cavalry
lost
a
greater
proportion
of
its
officers
than
any
other
regiment
in
the
battle
eleven
out
of
by
the
time
i
had
come
to
the
head
of
the
regiment
we
ran
into
the
left
wing
of
the
ninth
regulars
and
some
of
the
first
regulars
who
were
lying
down
that
is
the
troopers
were
lying
down
while
the
officers
were
walking
to
and
fro
the
officers
of
the
white
and
colored
regiments
alike
took
the
greatest
pride
in
seeing
that
the
men
more
than
did
their
duty
and
the
mortality
among
them
was
great
i
spoke
to
the
captain
in
command
of
the
rear
platoons
saying
that
i
had
been
ordered
to
support
the
regulars
in
the
attack
upon
the
hills
and
that
in
my
judgment
we
could
not
take
these
hills
by
firing
at
them
and
that
we
must
rush
them
he
answered
that
his
orders
were
to
keep
his
men
lying
where
they
were
and
that
he
could
not
charge
without
orders
i
asked
where
the
colonel
was
and
as
he
was
not
in
sight
said
then
i
am
the
ranking
officer
here
and
i
give
the
order
to
charge
for
i
did
not
want
to
keep
the
men
longer
in
the
open
suffering
under
a
fire
which
they
could
not
effectively
return
naturally
the
captain
hesitated
to
obey
this
order
when
no
word
had
been
received
from
his
own
colonel
so
i
said
then
let
my
men
through
sir
and
rode
on
through
the
lines
followed
by
the
grinning
rough
riders
whose
attention
had
been
completely
taken
off
the
spanish
bullets
partly
by
my
dialogue
with
the
regulars
and
partly
by
the
language
i
had
been
using
to
themselves
as
i
got
the
lines
forward
for
i
had
been
joking
with
some
and
swearing
at
others
as
the
exigencies
of
the
case
seemed
to
demand
when
we
started
to
go
through
however
it
proved
too
much
for
the
regulars
and
they
jumped
up
and
came
along
their
officers
and
troops
mingling
with
mine
all
being
delighted
at
the
chance
when
i
got
to
where
the
head
of
the
left
wing
of
the
ninth
was
lying
through
the
courtesy
of
lieutenant
hartwick
two
of
whose
colored
troopers
threw
down
the
fence
i
was
enabled
to
get
back
into
the
lane
at
the
same
time
waving
my
hat
and
giving
the
order
to
charge
the
hill
on
our
right
front
out
of
my
sight
over
on
the
right
captains
mcblain
and
taylor
of
the
ninth
made
up
their
minds
independently
to
charge
at
just
about
this
time
and
at
almost
the
same
moment
colonels
carroll
and
hamilton
who
were
off
i
believe
to
my
left
where
we
could
see
neither
them
nor
their
men
gave
the
order
to
advance
but
of
all
this
i
knew
nothing
at
the
time
the
whole
line
tired
of
waiting
and
eager
to
close
with
the
enemy
was
straining
to
go
forward
and
it
seems
that
different
parts
slipped
the
leash
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
first
cavalry
came
up
the
hill
just
behind
and
partly
mixed
with
my
regiment
and
the
ninth
as
already
said
portions
of
the
third
sixth
and
tenth
followed
while
the
rest
of
the
members
of
these
three
regiments
kept
more
in
touch
with
the
infantry
on
our
left
by
this
time
we
were
all
in
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
greatly
excited
by
the
charge
the
men
cheering
and
running
forward
between
shots
while
the
delighted
faces
of
the
foremost
officers
like
captain
stevens
of
the
ninth
as
they
ran
at
the
head
of
their
troops
will
always
stay
in
my
mind
as
soon
as
i
was
in
the
line
i
galloped
forward
a
few
yards
until
i
saw
that
the
men
were
well
started
and
then
galloped
back
to
help
goodrich
who
was
in
command
of
his
troop
get
his
men
across
the
road
so
as
to
attack
the
hill
from
that
side
captain
mills
had
already
thrown
three
of
the
other
troops
of
the
regiment
across
this
road
for
the
same
purpose
wheeling
around
i
then
again
galloped
toward
the
hill
passing
the
shouting
cheering
firing
men
and
went
up
the
lane
splashing
through
a
small
stream
when
i
got
abreast
of
the
ranch
buildings
on
the
top
of
kettle
hill
i
turned
and
went
up
the
slope
being
on
horseback
i
was
of
course
able
to
get
ahead
of
the
men
on
foot
excepting
my
orderly
henry
bardshar
who
had
run
ahead
very
fast
in
order
to
get
better
shots
at
the
spaniards
who
were
now
running
out
of
the
ranch
buildings
sergeant
campbell
and
a
number
of
the
arizona
men
and
dudley
dean
among
others
were
very
close
behind
stevens
with
his
platoon
of
the
ninth
was
abreast
of
us
so
were
mcnamee
and
hartwick
some
forty
yards
from
the
top
i
ran
into
a
wire
fence
and
jumped
off
little
texas
turning
him
loose
he
had
been
scraped
by
a
couple
of
bullets
one
of
which
nicked
my
elbow
and
i
never
expected
to
see
him
again
as
i
ran
up
to
the
hill
bardshar
stopped
to
shoot
and
two
spaniards
fell
as
he
emptied
his
magazine
these
were
the
only
spaniards
i
actually
saw
fall
to
aimed
shots
by
any
one
of
my
men
with
the
exception
of
two
guerillas
in
trees
almost
immediately
afterward
the
hill
was
covered
by
the
troops
both
rough
riders
and
the
colored
troopers
of
the
ninth
and
some
men
of
the
first
there
was
the
usual
confusion
and
afterward
there
was
much
discussion
as
to
exactly
who
had
been
on
the
hill
first
the
first
guidons
planted
there
were
those
of
the
three
new
mexican
troops
g
e
and
f
of
my
regiment
under
their
captains
llewellen
luna
and
muller
but
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
hill
at
the
opposite
end
from
where
we
struck
it
captains
taylor
and
mcblain
and
their
men
of
the
ninth
were
first
up
each
of
the
five
captains
was
firm
in
the
belief
that
his
troop
was
first
up
as
for
the
individual
men
each
of
whom
honestly
thought
he
was
first
on
the
summit
their
name
was
legion
one
spaniard
was
captured
in
the

he
tried
to

a

they
ran
among
the
many
deeds
of
conspicuous
gallantry

sergeant
charles
karsten
while
close
beside
captain
tutherly
the
squadron
commander
was
hit
by
a
shrapnel
bullet
he
continued
on
the
line
firing
until
his
arm
grew
numb
and
he
then
refused
to
go
to
the
rear
and
devoted
himself
to
taking
care
of
the
wounded
utterly
unmoved
by
the
heavy
fire
trooper
hugo
brittain
when
wounded
brought
the
regimental
standard
forward
waving
it
to
and
fro
to
cheer
the
men
no
sooner
were
we
on
the
crest
than
the
spaniards
from
the
line
of
hills
in
our
front
where
they
were
strongly
intrenched
opened
a
very
heavy
fire
upon
us
with
their
rifles
they
also
opened
upon
us
with
one
or
two
pieces
of
artillery
using
time
fuses
which
burned
very
accurately
the
shells
exploding
right
over
our
heads
on
the
top
of
the
hill
was
a
huge
iron
kettle
or
something
of
the
kind
probably
used
for
sugar
refining
several
of
our
men
took
shelter
behind
this
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
charge
on
the
san
juan
to
our
left
where
the
infantry
of
kent
led
by
hawkins
were
climbing
the
hill
obviously
the
proper
thing
to
do
was
to
help
them
and
i
got
the
men
together
and
started
them
against
the
spaniards
in
the
san
juan
and
in
the
trenches
around
it
we
could
only
see
their
heads
of
course
this
was
all
we
ever
could
see
when
we
were
firing
at
them
in
their
trenches
stevens
was
directing
not
only
his
own
colored
troopers
but
a
number
of
rough
riders
for
in
a
melee
good
soldiers
are
always
prompt
to
recognize
a
good
officer
and
are
eager
to
follow
him
we
kept
up
a
brisk
fire
for
some
five
or
ten
minutes
meanwhile
we
were
much
cut
up
ourselves
gallant
colonel
hamilton
than
whom
there
was
never
a
braver
man
was
killed
and
equally
gallant
colonel
carroll
wounded
when
near
the
summit
captain
mills
had
been
shot
through
the
head
the
bullet
destroying
the
sight
of
one
eye
permanently
and
of
the
other
temporarily
he
would
not
go
back
or
let
any
man
assist
him
sitting
down
where
he
was
and
waiting
until
one
of
the
men
brought
him
word
that
the
hill
was
stormed
colonel
veile
planted
the
standard
of
the
first
cavalry
on
the
hill
and
general
sumner
rode
up
he
was
fighting
his
division
in
great
form
and
was
always
himself
in
the
thick
of
the
fire
as
the
men
were
much
excited
by
the
firing
they
seemed
to
pay
very
little
heed
to
their
own
losses
suddenly
above
the
cracking
of
the
carbines
rose
a
peculiar
drumming
sound
and
some
of
the
men
cried
the
spanish
listening
i
made
out
that
it
came
from
the
flat
ground
to
the
left
and
jumped
to
my
feet
smiting
my
hand
on
my
thigh
and
shouting
aloud
with
exultation
it
the
gatlings
men
our
gatlings
lieutenant
parker
was
bringing
his
four
gatlings
into
action
and
shoving
them
nearer
and
nearer
the
front
now
and
then
the
drumming
ceased
for
a
moment
then
it
would
resound
again
always
closer
to
san
juan
hill
which
parker
like
ourselves
was
hammering
to
assist
the
infantry
attack
our
men
cheered
lustily
we
saw
much
of
parker
after
that
and
there
was
never
a
more
welcome
sound
than
his
gatlings
as
they
opened
it
was
the
only
sound
which
i
ever
heard
my
men
cheer
in
battle
the
infantry
got
nearer
and
nearer
the
crest
of
the
hill
at
last
we
could
see
the
spaniards
running
from
the
as
the
americans
came
on
in
their
final
rush
then
i
stopped
my
men
for
fear
they
should
injure
their
comrades
and
called
to
them
to
charge
the
next
line
of
trenches
on
the
hills
in
our
front
from
which
we
had
been
undergoing
a
good
deal
of
punishment
thinking
that
the
men
would
all
come
i
jumped
over
the
wire
fence
in
front
of
us
and
started
at
the
double
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
troopers
were
so
excited
what
with
shooting
and
being
shot
and
shouting
and
cheering
that
they
did
not
hear
or
did
not
heed
me
and
after
running
about
a
hundred
yards
i
found
i
had
only
five
men
along
with
me
bullets
were
ripping
the
grass
all
around
us
and
one
of
the
men
clay
green
was
mortally
wounded
another
winslow
clark
a
harvard
man
was
shot
first
in
the
leg
and
then
through
the
body
he
made
not
the
slightest
murmur
only
asking
me
to
put
his
water
canteen
where
he
could
get
at
it
which
i
did
he
ultimately
recovered
there
was
no
use
going
on
with
the
remaining
three
men
and
i
bade
them
stay
where
they
were
while
i
went
back
and
brought
up
the
rest
of
the
brigade
this
was
a
decidedly
cool
request
for
there
was
really
no
possible
point
in
letting
them
stay
there
while
i
went
back
but
at
the
moment
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
to
me
and
apparently
so
to
them
for
they
cheerfully
nodded
and
sat
down
in
the
grass
firing
back
at
the
line
of
trenches
from
which
the
spaniards
were
shooting
at
them
meanwhile
i
ran
back
jumped
over
the
wire
fence
and
went
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
filled
with
anger
against
the
troopers
and
especially
those
of
my
own
regiment
for
not
having
accompanied
me
they
of
course
were
quite
innocent
of
and
even
while
i
taunted
them
bitterly
for
not
having
followed
me
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
smile
at
the
look
of
injury
and
surprise
that
came
over
their
faces
while
they
cried
out
we
did
hear
you
we
did
see
you
go
colonel
lead
on
now
sure
follow
you
i
wanted
the
other
regiments
to
come
too
so
i
ran
down
to
where
general
sumner
was
and
asked
him
if
i
might
make
the
charge
and
he
told
me
to
go
and
that
he
would
see
that
the
men
followed
by
this
time
everybody
had
his
attention
attracted
and
when
i
leaped
over
the
fence
again
with
major
jenkins
beside
me
the
men
of
the
various
regiments
which
were
already
on
the
hill
came
with
a
rush
and
we
started
across
the
wide
valley
which
lay
between
us
and
the
spanish
intrenchments
captain
dimmick
now
in
command
of
the
ninth
was
bringing
it
forward
captain
mcblain
had
a
number
of
rough
riders
mixed
in
with
his
troop
and
led
them
all
together
captain
taylor
had
been
severely
wounded
the
men
like
greenway
goodrich
proffit
and
others
outstripped
the
rest
of
us
as
we
had
a
considerable
distance
to
go
long
before
we
got
near
them
the
spaniards
ran
save
a
few
here
and
there
who
either
surrendered
or
were
shot
down
when
we
reached
the
trenches
we
found
them
filled
with
dead
bodies
in
the
light
blue
and
white
uniform
of
the
spanish
regular
army
there
were
very
few
wounded
most
of
the
fallen
had
little
holes
in
their
heads
from
which
their
brains
were
oozing
for
they
were
covered
from
the
neck
down
by
the
trenches
it
was
at
this
place
that
major
wessels
of
the
third
cavalry
was
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head
it
was
a
severe
wound
but
after
having
it
bound
up
he
again
came
to
the
front
in
command
of
his
regiment
among
the
men
who
were
foremost
was
lieutenant
milton
davis
of
the
first
cavalry
he
had
been
joined
by
three
men
of
the
new
york
who
ran
up
and
saluting
said
lieutenant
we
want
to
go
with
you
our
officers
wo
lead
us
one
of
the
brave
fellows
was
soon
afterward
shot
in
the
face
lieutenant
davis
first
sergeant
clarence
gould
killed
a
spanish
soldier
with
his
revolver
just
as
the
spaniard
was
aiming
at
one
of
my
rough
riders
at
about
the
same
time
i
also
shot
one
i
was
with
henry
bardshar
running
up
at
the
double
and
two
spaniards
leaped
from
the
trenches
and
fired
at
us
not
ten
yards
away
as
they
turned
to
run
i
closed
in
and
fired
twice
missing
the
first
and
killing
the
second
my
revolver
was
from
the
sunken
maine
and
had
been
given
me
by
my
captain
cowles
of
the
navy
at
the
time
i
did
not
know
of
gould
exploit
and
supposed
my
feat
to
be
unique
and
although
gould
had
killed
his
spaniard
in
the
trenches
not
very
far
from
me
i
never
learned
of
it
until
weeks
after
it
is
astonishing
what
a
limited
area
of
vision
and
experience
one
has
in
the
of
a
battle
there
was
very
great
confusion
at
this
time
the
different
regiments
being
completely
intermingled
white
regulars
colored
regulars
and
rough
riders
general
sumner
had
kept
a
considerable
force
in
reserve
on
kettle
hill
under
major
jackson
of
the
third
cavalry
we
were
still
under
a
heavy
fire
and
i
got
together
a
mixed
lot
of
men
and
pushed
on
from
the
trenches
and
which
we
had
just
taken
driving
the
spaniards
through
a
line
of
and
over
the
crest
of
a
chain
of
hills
when
we
reached
these
crests
we
found
ourselves
overlooking
santiago
some
of
the
men
including
jenkins
greenway
and
goodrich
pushed
on
almost
by
themselves
far
ahead
lieutenant
hugh
berkely
of
the
first
with
a
sergeant
and
two
troopers
reached
the
extreme
front
he
was
at
the
time
ahead
of
everyone
the
sergeant
was
killed
and
one
trooper
wounded
but
the
lieutenant
and
the
remaining
trooper
stuck
to
their
post
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
until
our
line
was
gradually
extended
to
include
them
while
i
was
the
troops
on
the
chain
of
hills
one
of
general
sumner
aides
captain
robert
howze
as
dashing
and
gallant
an
officer
as
there
was
in
the
whole
gallant
cavalry
division
by
the
way
came
up
with
orders
to
me
to
halt
where
i
was
not
advancing
farther
but
to
hold
the
hill
at
all
hazards
howze
had
his
horse
and
i
had
some
difficulty
in
making
him
take
proper
shelter
he
stayed
with
us
for
quite
a
time
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
extreme
front
and
meanwhile
jumping
at
the
chance
to
render
any
service
of
risk
or
otherwise
which
the
moment
developed
i
now
had
under
me
all
the
fragments
of
the
six
cavalry
regiments
which
were
at
the
extreme
front
being
the
highest
officer
left
there
and
i
was
in
immediate
command
of
them
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
and
that
night
the
ninth
was
over
to
the
right
and
the
thirteenth
infantry
afterward
came
up
beside
it
the
rest
of
infantry
was
to
our
left
of
the
tenth
lieutenants
anderson
muller
and
fleming
reported
to
me
anderson
was
slightly
wounded
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
this
all
three
like
every
other
officer
had
troopers
of
various
regiments
under
them
such
mixing
was
inevitable
in
making
repeated
charges
through
thick
jungle
it
was
essentially
a
troop
commanders
indeed
almost
a
squad
leaders
fight
the
spaniards
who
had
been
holding
the
trenches
and
the
line
of
hills
had
fallen
back
upon
their
supports
and
we
were
under
a
very
heavy
fire
both
from
rifles
and
great
guns
at
the
point
where
we
were
the
was
gently
rounded
giving
poor
cover
and
i
made
my
men
lie
down
on
the
hither
slope
on
the
extreme
left
captain
beck
of
the
tenth
with
his
own
troop
and
small
bodies
of
the
men
of
other
regiments
was
exercising
a
practically
independent
command
driving
back
the
spaniards
whenever
they
showed
any
symptoms
of
advancing
he
had
received
his
orders
to
hold
the
line
at
all
hazards
from
lieutenant
andrews
one
of
general
sumner
aides
just
as
i
had
received
mine
from
captain
howze
finally
he
was
relieved
by
some
infantry
and
then
rejoined
the
rest
of
the
tenth
which
was
engaged
heavily
until
dark
major
wint
being
among
the
severely
wounded
lieutenant
smith
was
killed
captain
bigelow
had
been
wounded
three
times
our
artillery
made
one
or
two
efforts
to
come
into
action
on
the
of
the
infantry
but
the
black
powder
rendered
each
attempt
fruitless
the
spanish
guns
used
smokeless
powder
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
place
them
in
this
respect
they
were
on
a
par
with
their
own
infantry
and
with
our
regular
infantry
and
dismounted
cavalry
but
our
only
two
volunteer
infantry
regiments
the
second
massachusetts
and
the
new
york
and
our
artillery
all
had
black
powder
this
rendered
the
two
volunteer
regiments
which
were
armed
with
the
antiquated
springfield
almost
useless
in
the
battle
and
did
practically
the
same
thing
for
the
artillery
wherever
it
was
formed
within
rifle
range
when
one
of
the
guns
was
discharged
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
shot
out
and
hung
over
the
place
making
an
ideal
target
and
in
a
half
minute
every
spanish
gun
and
rifle
within
range
was
directed
at
the
particular
spot
thus
indicated
the
consequence
was
that
after
a
more
or
less
lengthy
stand
the
gun
was
silenced
or
driven
off
we
got
no
appreciable
help
from
our
guns
on
july
our
men
were
quick
to
realize
the
defects
of
our
artillery
but
they
were
entirely
philosophic
about
it
not
showing
the
least
concern
at
its
failure
on
the
contrary
whenever
they
heard
our
artillery
open
they
would
grin
as
they
looked
at
one
another
and
remark
there
go
the
guns
again
wonder
how
soon
they
be
shut
up
and
shut
up
they
were
sure
to
be
the
light
battery
of
hotchkiss
under
lieutenant
j
hughes
of
the
tenth
cavalry
was
handled
with
conspicuous
gallantry
on
the
immediately
around
me
i
had
a
mixed
force
composed
of
members
of
most
of
the
cavalry
regiments
and
a
few
infantrymen
there
were
about
fifty
of
my
rough
riders
with
lieutenants
goodrich
and
carr
among
the
rest
were
perhaps
a
score
of
colored
infantrymen
but
as
it
happened
at
this
particular
point
without
any
of
their
officers
no
troops
could
have
behaved
better
than
the
colored
soldiers
had
behaved
so
far
but
they
are
of
course
peculiarly
dependent
upon
their
white
officers
occasionally
they
produce
officers
who
can
take
the
initiative
and
accept
responsibility
precisely
like
the
best
class
of
whites
but
this
can
not
be
expected
normally
nor
is
it
fair
to
expect
it
with
the
colored
troops
there
should
always
be
some
of
their
own
officers
whereas
with
the
white
regulars
as
with
my
own
rough
riders
experience
showed
that
the
officers
could
usually
carry
on
the
fight
by
themselves
if
they
were
once
started
no
matter
whether
their
officers
were
killed
or
not
at
this
particular
time
it
was
trying
for
the
men
as
they
were
lying
flat
on
their
faces
very
rarely
responding
to
the
bullets
shells
and
shrapnel
which
swept
over
the
and
which
occasionally
killed
or
wounded
one
of
their
number
major
albert
forse
of
the
first
cavalry
a
noted
indian
fighter
was
killed
about
this
time
one
of
my
best
men
sergeant
greenly
of
arizona
who
was
lying
beside
me
suddenly
said
beg
pardon
colonel
but
i
been
hit
in
the
leg
i
asked
badly
he
said
yes
colonel
quite
badly
after
one
of
his
comrades
had
helped
him
fix
up
his
leg
with
a
bandage
he
limped
off
to
the
rear
none
of
the
white
regulars
or
rough
riders
showed
the
slightest
sign
of
weakening
but
under
the
strain
the
colored
infantrymen
who
had
none
of
their
officers
began
to
get
a
little
uneasy
and
to
drift
to
the
rear
either
helping
wounded
men
or
saying
that
they
wished
to
find
their
own
regiments
this
i
could
not
allow
as
it
was
depleting
my
line
so
i
jumped
up
and
walking
a
few
yards
to
the
rear
drew
my
revolver
halted
the
retreating
soldiers
and
called
out
to
them
that
i
appreciated
the
gallantry
with
which
they
had
fought
and
would
be
sorry
to
hurt
them
but
that
i
should
shoot
the
first
man
who
on
any
pretence
whatever
went
to
the
rear
my
own
men
had
all
sat
up
and
were
watching
my
movements
with
utmost
interest
so
was
captain
howze
i
ended
my
statement
to
the
colored
soldiers
by
saying
now
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
hurt
you
and
you
do
know
whether
or
not
i
will
keep
my
word
but
my
men
can
tell
you
that
i
always
do
whereupon
my
hunters
and
miners
solemnly
nodded
their
heads
and
commented
in
chorus
exactly
as
if
in
a
comic
opera
he
always
does
he
always
does
this
was
the
end
of
the
trouble
for
the
smoked
yankees
as
the
spaniards
called
the
colored
soldiers
flashed
their
white
teeth
at
one
another
as
they
broke
into
broad
grins
and
i
had
no
more
trouble
with
them
they
seeming
to
accept
me
as
one
of
their
own
officers
the
colored
had
already
so
accepted
me
in
return
the
rough
riders
although
for
the
most
part
southwesterners
who
have
a
strong
color
prejudice
grew
to
accept
them
with
hearty
as
comrades
and
were
entirely
willing
in
their
own
phrase
to
drink
out
of
the
same
canteen
where
all
the
regular
officers
did
so
well
it
is
hard
to
draw
any
distinction
but
in
the
cavalry
division
a
peculiar
meed
of
praise
should
be
given
to
the
officers
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
for
their
work
and
under
their
leadership
the
colored
troops
did
as
well
as
any
soldiers
could
possibly
do
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
spaniards
in
our
front
made
the
only
offensive
movement
which
i
saw
them
make
during
the
entire
campaign
for
what
were
ordinarily
called
attacks
upon
our
lines
consisted
merely
of
heavy
firing
from
their
trenches
and
from
their
skirmishers
in
this
case
they
did
actually
begin
to
make
a
forward
movement
their
cavalry
coming
up
as
well
as
the
marines
and
reserve
infantry
while
their
skirmishers
who
were
always
bold
redoubled
their
activity
it
could
not
be
called
a
charge
and
not
only
was
it
not
pushed
home
but
it
was
stopped
almost
as
soon
as
it
began
our
men
immediately
running
forward
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
with
shouts
of
delight
at
seeing
their
enemies
at
last
come
into
the
open
a
few
seconds
firing
stopped
their
advance
and
drove
them
into
the
cover
of
the
trenches
note
lieutenant
tejeiro
speaks
of
this
attempt
to
retake
san
juan
and
its
failure
they
kept
up
a
very
heavy
fire
for
some
time
longer
and
our
men
again
lay
down
only
replying
occasionally
suddenly
we
heard
on
our
right
the
peculiar
drumming
sound
which
had
been
so
welcome
in
the
morning
when
the
infantry
were
assailing
the
san
juan
the
gatlings
were
up
again
i
started
over
to
inquire
and
found
that
lieutenant
parker
not
content
with
using
his
guns
in
support
of
the
attacking
forces
had
thrust
them
forward
to
the
extreme
front
of
the
where
he
was
handling
them
with
great
effect
from
this
time
on
throughout
the
fighting
parker
gatlings
were
on
the
right
of
my
regiment
and
his
men
and
mine
fraternized
in
every
way
he
kept
his
pieces
at
the
extreme
front
using
them
on
every
occasion
until
the
last
spanish
shot
was
fired
indeed
the
dash
and
efficiency
with
which
the
gatlings
were
handled
by
parker
was
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
campaign
he
showed
that
a
officer
could
use
on
wheels
in
battle
and
skirmish
in
attacking
and
defending
trenches
alongside
of
the
best
troops
and
to
their
great
advantage
as
night
came
on
the
firing
gradually
died
away
before
this
happened
however
captains
morton
and
boughton
of
the
third
cavalry
came
over
to
tell
me
that
a
rumor
had
reached
them
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
some
talk
of
retiring
and
that
they
wished
to
protest
in
the
strongest
manner
i
had
been
watching
them
both
as
they
handled
their
troops
with
the
cool
confidence
of
the
veteran
regular
officer
and
had
been
congratulating
myself
that
they
were
off
toward
the
right
flank
for
as
long
as
they
were
there
i
knew
i
was
perfectly
safe
in
that
direction
i
had
heard
no
rumor
about
retiring
and
i
cordially
agreed
with
them
that
it
would
be
far
worse
than
a
blunder
to
abandon
our
position
to
attack
the
spaniards
by
rushing
across
open
ground
or
through
wire
entanglements
and
low
almost
impassable
jungle
without
the
help
of
artillery
and
to
force
unbroken
infantry
fighting
behind
earthworks
and
armed
with
the
best
repeating
weapons
supported
by
cannon
was
one
thing
to
repel
such
an
attack
ourselves
or
to
fight
our
foes
on
anything
like
even
terms
in
the
open
was
quite
another
thing
no
possible
number
of
spaniards
coming
at
us
from
in
front
could
have
driven
us
from
our
position
and
there
was
not
a
man
on
the
crest
who
did
not
eagerly
and
devoutly
hope
that
our
opponents
would
make
the
attempt
for
it
would
surely
have
been
followed
not
merely
by
a
repulse
but
by
our
immediately
taking
the
city
there
was
not
an
officer
or
a
man
on
the
so
far
as
i
saw
them
who
did
not
feel
this
way
as
night
fell
some
of
my
men
went
back
to
the
buildings
in
our
rear
and
foraged
through
them
for
we
had
now
been
fourteen
hours
charging
and
fighting
without
food
they
came
across
what
was
evidently
the
spanish
officers
mess
where
their
dinner
was
still
cooking
and
they
brought
it
to
the
front
in
high
glee
it
was
evident
that
the
spanish
officers
were
living
well
however
the
spanish
rank
and
file
were
faring
there
were
three
big
iron
pots
one
filled
with
one
with
boiled
rice
and
one
with
boiled
peas
there
was
a
big
demijohn
of
rum
all
along
the
trenches
which
the
spaniards
held
were
empty
wine
and
liquor
bottles
there
were
a
number
of
loaves
of
and
there
were
even
some
small
cans
of
preserves
and
a
few
salt
fish
of
course
among
so
many
men
the
food
which
was
equally
divided
did
not
give
very
much
to
each
but
it
freshened
us
all
soon
after
dark
general
wheeler
who
in
the
afternoon
had
resumed
command
of
the
cavalry
division
came
to
the
front
a
very
few
words
with
general
wheeler
reassured
us
about
retiring
he
had
been
through
too
much
heavy
fighting
in
the
civil
war
to
regard
the
present
fight
as
very
serious
and
he
told
us
not
to
be
under
any
apprehension
for
he
had
sent
word
that
there
was
no
need
whatever
of
retiring
and
was
sure
we
would
stay
where
we
were
until
the
chance
came
to
advance
he
was
second
in
command
and
to
him
more
than
to
any
other
one
man
was
due
the
prompt
abandonment
of
the
proposal
to
fall
back
a
proposal
which
if
adopted
would
have
meant
shame
and
disaster
shortly
afterward
general
wheeler
sent
us
orders
to
intrench
the
men
of
the
different
regiments
were
now
getting
in
place
again
and
sifting
themselves
out
all
of
our
troops
who
had
been
kept
at
kettle
hill
came
forward
and
rejoined
us
after
nightfall
during
the
afternoon
greenway
apparently
not
having
enough
to
do
in
the
fighting
had
taken
advantage
of
a
lull
to
explore
the
buildings
himself
and
had
found
a
number
of
spanish
intrenching
tools
picks
and
shovels
and
these
we
used
in
digging
trenches
along
our
line
the
men
were
very
tired
indeed
but
they
went
cheerfully
to
work
all
the
officers
doing
their
part
crockett
the
officer
from
georgia
was
a
slight
man
not
physically
very
strong
he
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
did
think
he
would
be
much
use
in
digging
but
that
he
had
found
a
lot
of
spanish
coffee
and
would
spend
his
time
making
coffee
for
the
men
if
i
approved
i
did
approve
very
heartily
and
crockett
officiated
as
cook
for
the
next
three
or
four
hours
until
the
trench
was
dug
his
coffee
being
much
appreciated
by
all
of
us
so
many
acts
of
gallantry
were
performed
during
the
day
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
notice
them
all
and
it
seems
unjust
to
single
out
any
yet
i
shall
mention
a
few
which
it
must
always
be
remembered
are
to
stand
not
as
exceptions
but
as
instances
of
what
very
many
men
did
it
happened
that
i
saw
these
myself
there
were
innumerable
others
which
either
were
not
seen
at
all
or
were
seen
only
by
officers
who
happened
not
to
mention
them
and
of
course
i
know
chiefly
those
that
happened
in
my
own
regiment
captain
llewellen
was
a
large
heavy
man
who
had
a
son
in
the
ranks
on
the
march
he
had
frequently
carried
the
load
of
some
man
who
weakened
and
he
was
not
feeling
well
on
the
morning
of
the
fight
nevertheless
he
kept
at
the
head
of
his
troop
all
day
in
the
charging
and
rushing
he
not
only
became
very
much
exhausted
but
finally
fell
wrenching
himself
terribly
and
though
he
remained
with
us
all
night
he
was
so
sick
by
morning
that
we
had
to
take
him
behind
the
hill
into
an
improvised
hospital
lieutenant
day
after
handling
his
troop
with
equal
gallantry
and
efficiency
was
shot
on
the
summit
of
kettle
hill
he
was
hit
in
the
arm
and
was
forced
to
go
to
the
rear
but
he
would
not
return
to
the
states
and
rejoined
us
at
the
front
long
before
his
wound
was
healed
lieutenant
leahy
was
also
wounded
not
far
from
him
thirteen
of
the
men
were
wounded
and
yet
kept
on
fighting
until
the
end
of
the
day
and
in
some
cases
never
went
to
the
rear
at
all
even
to
have
their
wounds
dressed

was
shot
through
the
left
arm
so
as
to
paralyze
the
fingers
but
he
continued
in
battle
pointing
his
rifle
over
the
wounded
arm
as
though
it
had
been
a
rest
the
other
waller
and
bugbee
were
hit
in
the
head
the
bullets
merely
inflicting
scalp
wounds
neither
of
them
paid
any
heed
to
the
wounds
except
that
after
nightfall
each
had
his
head
done
up
in
a
bandage
fortescue
i
was
at
times
using
as
an
extra
orderly
i
noticed
he
limped
but
supposed
that
his
foot
was
skinned
it
proved
however
that
he
had
been
struck
in
the
foot
though
not
very
seriously
by
a
bullet
and
i
never
knew
what
was
the
matter
until
the
next
day
i
saw
him
making
wry
faces
as
he
drew
off
his
bloody
boot
which
was
stuck
fast
to

from

to

had
fought
in

other
five
their
troops
for
each
of
them
owing
to
some
accident
to
his

himself
in

of

worked
quite
as
hard
as
any
man
at

front
in
caring
for
the
wounded
as
had
chaplain
brown
lieutenant
keyes
who
acted
as
adjutant
did
so
well
that
he
was
given
the
position
permanently
lieutenant
coleman
similarly
won
the
position
of
quartermaster
we
finished
digging
the
trench
soon
after
midnight
and
then
the
men
laid
down
in
rows
on
their
rifles
and
dropped
heavily
to
sleep
about
one
in
ten
of
them
had
blankets
taken
from
the
spaniards
henry
bardshar
my
orderly
had
procured
one
for
me
he
goodrich
and
i
slept
together
if
the
men
without
blankets
had
not
been
so
tired
that
they
fell
asleep
anyhow
they
would
have
been
very
cold
for
of
course
we
were
all
drenched
with
sweat
and
above
the
waist
had
on
nothing
but
our
flannel
shirts
while
the
night
was
cool
with
a
heavy
dew
before
anyone
had
time
to
wake
from
the
cold
however
we
were
all
awakened
by
the
spaniards
whose
skirmishers
suddenly
opened
fire
on
us
of
course
we
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
this
was
the
forerunner
of
a
heavy
attack
for
our
cossack
posts
were
responding
briskly
it
was
about
three
in
the
morning
at
which
time
men
courage
is
said
to
be
at
the
lowest
ebb
but
the
cavalry
division
was
certainly
free
from
any
weakness
in
that
direction
at
the
alarm
everybody
jumped
to
his
feet
and
the
stiff
shivering
haggard
men
their
eyes
only
all
clutched
their
rifles
and
ran
forward
to
the
trench
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
sputtering
shots
died
away
and
we
went
to
sleep
again
but
in
another
hour
dawn
broke
and
the
spaniards
opened
fire
in
good
earnest
there
was
a
little
tree
only
a
few
feet
away
under
which
i
made
my
and
while
i
was
lying
there
with
goodrich
and
keyes
a
shrapnel
burst
among
us
not
hurting
us
in
the
least
but
with
the
sweep
of
its
bullets
killing
or
wounding
five
men
in
our
rear
one
of
whom
was
a
singularly
gallant
young
harvard
fellow
stanley
hollister
an
equally
gallant
young
fellow
from
yale
theodore
miller
had
already
been
mortally
wounded
hollister
also
died
the
second
brigade
lost
more
heavily
than
the
first
but
neither
its
brigade
commander
nor
any
of
its
regimental
commanders
were
touched
while
the
commander
of
the
first
brigade
and
two
of
its
three
regimental
commanders
had
been
killed
or
wounded
in
this
fight
our
regiment
had
numbered
men
as
in
addition
to
the
killed
and
wounded
of
the
first
fight
some
had
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
for
sickness
and
some
had
been
left
behind
with
the
baggage
or
were
detailed
on
other
duty
were
killed
and
wounded
the
heaviest
loss
suffered
by
any
regiment
in
the
cavalry
division
the
spaniards
made
a
stiff
fight
standing
firm
until
we
charged
home
they
fought
much
more
stubbornly
than
at
las
guasimas
we
ought
to
have
expected
this
for
they
have
always
done
well
in
holding
intrenchments
on
this
day
they
showed
themselves
to
be
brave
foes
worthy
of
honor
for
their
gallantry
in
the
attack
on
the
san
juan
hills
our
forces
numbered
about
there
were
about
spaniards
against
us
our
total
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
of
the
cavalry
division
there
were
all
told
some
officers
and
men
of
whom
were
killed
and
wounded
in
the
division
over
a
fourth
of
the
officers
were
killed
or
wounded
their
loss
being
relatively
half
as
great
again
as
that
of
the
enlisted
men
which
was
as
it
should
be
note
according
to
the
official
reports
officers
and
men
of
kent
infantry
and
of
the
cavalry
had
been
landed
my
regiment
is
put
down
as
strong
instead
of
the
real
figure
the
difference
being
due
to
men
who
were
in
hospital
and
on
guard
at
the
seashore
etc
in
other
words
the
total
represents
the
total
landed
the
details
are
included
general
wheeler
in
his
report
of
july
puts
these
details
as
about
fifteen
per
cent
of
the
whole
of
the
force
which
was
on
the
transports
about
per
cent
got
forward
and
was
in
the
fight
note
the
total
spanish
force
in
santiago
under
general
linares
was
regulars
volunteers
and
marines
and
sailors
from
the
ships
diary
of
the
british
consul
frederick
ramsden
entry
of
july
four
thousand
more
troops
entered
next
day
of
the
troops
or
thereabouts
were
at
el
caney
and
in
the
forts
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
lieutenant
tejeiro
states
that
there
were
men
at
el
caney
in
the
forts
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
and
in
the
lines
not
counting
the
cavalry
and
civil
guard
which
were
in
reserve
he
certainly
very
much
understates
the
spanish
force
thus
he
nowhere
accounts
for
the
engineers
mentioned
on
and
his
figures
would
make
the
total
number
of
spanish
artillerymen
but
he
excludes
the
cavalry
the
civil
guard
and
the
marines
which
had
been
stationed
at
the
plaza
del
toros
yet
he
later
mentions
that
these
marines
were
brought
up
and
their
commander
bustamente
severely
wounded
he
states
that
the
cavalry
advanced
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
infantry
and
i
myself
saw
the
cavalry
come
forward
for
the
most
part
dismounted
when
the
spaniards
attempted
a
forward
movement
late
in
the
afternoon
and
we
shot
many
of
their
horses
while
later
i
saw
and
conversed
with
officers
and
men
of
the
civil
guard
who
had
been
wounded
at
the
same
time
this
in
connection
with
returning
them
their
wives
and
children
after
the
latter
had
fled
from
the
city
although
the
engineers
are
excluded
lieutenant
tejeiro
mentions
that
their
colonel
as
well
as
the
colonel
of
the
artillery
was
wounded
four
thousand
five
hundred
is
surely
an
understatement
of
the
forces
which
resisted
the
attack
of
the
forces
under
wheeler
lieutenant
tejeiro
is
very
careless
in
his
figures
thus
in
one
place
he
states
that
the
position
of
san
juan
was
held
by
two
companies
comprising
soldiers
later
he
says
it
was
held
by
three
companies
whose
strength
he
puts
at
thus
making
them
average
instead
of
men
apiece
he
then
mentions
another
echelon
of
two
companies
so
situated
as
to
cross
their
fire
with
the
others
doubtless
the
and
trenches
at
fort
san
juan
proper
were
only
held
by
three
or
four
hundred
men
they
were
taken
by
the
sixth
and
sixteenth
infantry
under
hawkins
immediate
command
and
they
formed
but
one
point
in
the
line
of
hills
trenches
and
which
the
spaniards
held
and
from
which
we
drove
them
when
the
city
capitulated
later
over
unwounded
troops
and
over
rifles
and
carbines
were
surrendered
by
that
time
the
marines
and
sailors
had
of
course
gone
and
the
volunteers
had
disbanded
in
all
these
figures
i
have
taken
merely
the
statements
from
the
spanish
side
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
actual
numbers
were
much
greater
than
those
here
given
lieutenant
wiley
in
his
book
cuba
with
which
is
practically
an
official
statement
states
that
nearly
spanish
troops
were
surrendered
and
this
is
the
number
given
by
the
spaniards
themselves
in
the
remarkable
letter
the
captured
soldiers
addressed
to
general
shafter
which
wiley
quotes
in
full
lieutenant
tejeiro
in
his
chap
explains
that
the
volunteers
had
disbanded
before
the
end
came
and
the
marines
and
sailors
had
of
course
gone
while
nearly
a
thousand
men
had
been
killed
or
captured
or
had
died
of
wounds
and
disease
so
that
there
must
have
been
at
least
all
told
subtracting
the
reinforcements
who
arrived
on
the
this
would
mean
about
spaniards
present
on
the
in
which
case
kent
and
wheeler
were
opposed
by
at
least
equal
numbers
in
dealing
with
the
spanish
losses
lieutenant
tejeiro
contradicts
himself
he
puts
their
total
loss
on
this
day
at
including
killed
missing
and
prisoners
in
all
yet
he
states
that
of
the
men
at
caney
but
got
back
the
remaining
being
killed
captured
or
missing
when
we
captured
the
city
we
found
in
the
hospitals
over
seriously
wounded
and
sick
spaniards
on
making
inquiries
i
found
that
over
a
third
were
wounded
from
these
facts
i
feel
that
it
is
safe
to
put
down
the
total
spanish
loss
in
battle
as
at
least
of
whom
over
a
thousand
were
killed
and
wounded
lieutenant
tejeiro
while
rightly
claiming
credit
for
the
courage
shown
by
the
spaniards
also
praises
the
courage
and
resolution
of
the
americans
saying
that
they
fought
con
un
arrojo
y
una
decision
verdaderamente
admirables
he
dwells
repeatedly
upon
the
determination
with
which
our
troops
kept
charging
though
themselves
unprotected
by
cover
as
for
the
spanish
troops
all
who
fought
them
that
day
will
most
freely
admit
the
courage
they
showed
at
el
caney
where
they
were
nearly
hemmed
in
they
made
a
most
desperate
defence
at
san
juan
the
way
to
retreat
was
open
and
so
though
they
were
seven
times
as
numerous
they
fought
with
less
desperation
but
still
very
gallantly
i
think
we
suffered
more
heavily
than
the
spaniards
did
in
killed
and
wounded
though
we
also
captured
some
scores
of
prisoners
it
would
have
been
very
extraordinary
if
the
reverse
was
the
case
for
we
did
the
charging
and
to
carry
earthworks
on
foot
with
dismounted
cavalry
when
these
earthworks
are
held
by
unbroken
infantry
armed
with
the
best
modern
rifles
is
a
serious
task
v
in
the
trenches
when
the
shrapnel
burst
among
us
on
the
we
made
up
our
minds
that
we
had
better
settle
down
to
solid
siege
work
all
of
the
men
who
were
not
in
the
trenches
i
took
off
to
the
right
back
of
the
gatling
guns
where
there
was
a
valley
and
dispersed
them
by
troops
in
sheltered
parts
it
took
us
an
hour
or
two
experimenting
to
find
out
exactly
what
spots
were
free
from
danger
because
some
of
the
spanish
were
in
trees
in
our
front
where
we
could
not
possibly
place
them
from
the
trenches
and
these
were
able
to
reach
little
hollows
and
depressions
where
the
men
were
entirely
safe
from
the
spanish
artillery
and
from
their
moreover
in
one
hollow
which
we
thought
safe
the
spaniards
succeeded
in
dropping
a
shell
a
fragment
of
which
went
through
the
head
of
one
of
my
men
who
astonishing
to
say
lived
although
unconscious
for
two
hours
afterward
finally
i
got
all
eight
troops
settled
and
the
men
promptly
proceeded
to
make
themselves
as
much
at
home
as
possible
for
the
next
hours
however
the
amount
of
comfort
was
small
as
in
the
way
of
protection
and
covering
we
only
had
what
blankets
and
hammocks
we
took
from
the
dead
spaniards
ammunition
which
was
of
course
the
most
vital
need
was
brought
up
in
abundance
but
very
little
food
reached
us
that
afternoon
we
had
just
enough
to
allow
each
man
for
his
supper
two
hardtacks
and
one
hardtack
extra
for
every
four
men
during
the
first
night
we
had
dug
trenches
sufficient
in
length
and
depth
to
shelter
our
men
and
insure
safety
against
attack
but
we
had
not
put
in
any
traverses
or
approaches
nor
had
we
arranged
the
trenches
at
all
points
in
the
best
places
for
offensive
work
for
we
were
working
at
night
on
ground
which
we
had
but
partially
explored
later
on
an
engineer
officer
stated
that
he
did
not
think
our
work
had
been
scientific
and
i
assured
him
that
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
was
right
for
i
had
never
before
seen
a
trench
excepting
those
we
captured
from
the
spaniards
or
heard
of
a
traverse
save
as
i
vaguely
remembered
reading
about
them
in
books
for
such
work
as
we
were
engaged
in
however
the
problem
of
intrenchment
was
comparatively
simple
and
the
work
we
did
proved
entirely
adequate
no
man
in
my
regiment
was
ever
hit
in
the
trenches
or
going
in
or
out
of
them
but
on
the
first
day
there
was
plenty
of
excitement
connected
with
relieving
the
firing
line
under
the
intense
heat
crowded
down
in
cramped
attitudes
in
the
rank
newly
dug
poisonous
soil
of
the
trenches
the
men
needed
to
be
relieved
every
six
hours
or
so
accordingly
in
the
late
morning
and
again
in
the
afternoon
i
arranged
for
their
release
on
each
occasion
i
waited
until
there
was
a
lull
in
the
firing
and
then
started
a
sudden
rush
by
the
relieving
party
who
tumbled
into
the
trenches
every
which
way
the
movement
resulted
on
each
occasion
in
a
terrific
outburst
of
fire
from
the
spanish
lines
which
proved
quite
harmless
and
as
it
gradually
died
away
the
men
who
had
been
relieved
got
out
as
best
they
could
fortunately
by
the
next
day
i
was
able
to
abandon
this
primitive
though
thrilling
and
wholly
novel
military
method
of
relief
when
the
hardtack
came
up
that
afternoon
i
felt
much
sympathy
for
the
hungry
unfortunates
in
the
trenches
and
hated
to
condemn
them
to
six
hours
more
without
food
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
get
food
into
them
little
mcginty
the
bronco
buster
volunteered
to
make
the
attempt
and
i
gave
him
permission
he
simply
took
a
case
of
hardtack
in
his
arms
and
darted
toward
the
trenches
the
distance
was
but
short
and
though
there
was
an
outburst
of
fire
he
was
actually
missed
one
bullet
however
passed
through
the
case
of
hardtack
just
before
he
disappeared
with
it
into
the
trench
a
trooper
named
shanafelt
repeated
the
feat
later
with
a
pail
of
coffee
another
trooper
george
king
spent
a
leisure
hour
in
the
rear
making
soup
out
of
some
rice
and
other
stuff
he
found
in
a
spanish
house
he
brought
some
of
it
to
general
wood
jack
greenway
and
myself
and
nothing
could
have
tasted
more
delicious
at
this
time
our
army
in
the
trenches
numbered
about
men
and
the
spaniards
in
santiago
about
their
reinforcements
having
just
arrived
nobody
on
the
firing
line
whatever
was
the
case
in
the
rear
felt
the
slightest
uneasiness
as
to
the
spaniards
being
able
to
break
out
but
there
were
plenty
who
doubted
the
advisability
of
trying
to
rush
the
heavy
earthworks
and
wire
defenses
in
our
front
note
this
is
probably
an
understatement
lieutenant
muller
in
chap
xxxviii
of
his
book
says
that
there
were
eight
or
nine
thousand
this
is
exclusive
of
the
men
from
the
fleet
and
apparently
also
of
many
of
the
volunteers
see
chap
xiv
all
of
whom
were
present
on
july
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
on
the
evening
of
that
day
there
were
more
spanish
troops
inside
santiago
than
there
were
american
troops
outside
all
day
long
the
firing
continued
musketry
and
cannon
our
artillery
gave
up
the
attempt
to
fight
on
the
firing
line
and
was
withdrawn
well
to
the
rear
out
of
range
of
the
spanish
rifles
so
far
as
we
could
see
it
accomplished
very
little
the
dynamite
gun
was
brought
up
to
the
right
of
the
regimental
line
it
was
more
effective
than
the
regular
artillery
because
it
was
fired
with
smokeless
powder
and
as
it
was
used
like
a
mortar
from
behind
the
hill
it
did
not
betray
its
presence
and
those
firing
it
suffered
no
loss
every
few
shots
it
got
out
of
order
and
the
rough
rider
machinists
and
those
furnished
by
lieutenant
parker
whom
we
by
this
time
began
to
consider
as
an
exceedingly
valuable
member
of
our
own
regiment
would
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
setting
it
right
sergeant
borrowe
had
charge
of
it
and
handled
it
well
with
him
was
sergeant
guitilias
a
gallant
old
fellow
a
veteran
of
the
civil
war
whose
duties
were
properly
those
of
he
having
charge
of
the
yellow
cavalry
standard
of
the
regiment
but
in
the
cuban
campaign
he
was
given
the
more
active
work
of
helping
run
the
dynamite
gun
the
shots
from
the
dynamite
gun
made
a
terrific
explosion
but
they
did
not
seem
to
go
accurately
once
one
of
them
struck
a
spanish
trench
and
wrecked
part
of
it
on
another
occasion
one
struck
a
big
building
from
which
there
promptly
swarmed
both
spanish
cavalry
and
infantry
on
whom
the
colt
automatic
guns
played
with
good
effect
during
the
minute
that
elapsed
before
they
could
get
other
cover
these
colt
automatic
guns
were
not
on
the
whole
very
successful
the
gun
detail
was
under
the
charge
of
sergeant
afterward
lieutenant
tiffany
assisted
by
some
of
our
best
men
like
stevens
crowninshield
bradley
smith
and
herrig
the
guns
were
mounted
on
tripods
they
were
too
heavy
for
men
to
carry
any
distance
and
we
could
not
always
get
mules
they
would
have
been
more
effective
if
mounted
on
wheels
as
the
gatlings
were
moreover
they
proved
more
delicate
than
the
gatlings
and
very
readily
got
out
of
order
a
further
and
serious
disadvantage
was
that
they
did
not
use
the
krag
ammunition
as
the
gatlings
did
but
the
mauser
ammunition
the
spanish
cartridges
which
we
captured
came
in
quite
handily
for
this
reason
parker
took
the
same
fatherly
interest
in
these
two
colts
that
he
did
in
the
dynamite
gun
and
finally
i
put
all
three
and
their
men
under
his
immediate
care
so
that
he
had
a
battery
of
seven
guns
in
fact
i
think
parker
deserved
rather
more
credit
than
any
other
one
man
in
the
entire
campaign
i
do
not
allude
especially
to
his
courage
and
energy
great
though
they
were
for
there
were
hundreds
of
his
of
the
cavalry
and
infantry
who
possessed
as
much
of
the
former
quality
and
scores
who
possessed
as
much
of
the
latter
but
he
had
the
rare
good
judgment
and
foresight
to
see
the
possibilities
of
the
and
thanks
to
the
aid
of
general
shafter
he
was
able
to
organize
his
battery
he
then
by
his
own
exertions
got
it
to
the
front
and
proved
that
it
could
do
invaluable
work
on
the
field
of
battle
as
much
in
attack
as
in
defence
gatlings
were
our
inseparable
companions
throughout
the
siege
after
our
trenches
were
put
in
final
shape
he
took
off
the
wheels
of
a
couple
and
placed
them
with
our
own
two
colts
in
the
trenches
his
gunners
slept
beside
the
rough
riders
in
the
and
the
men
shared
with
one
another
when
either
side
got
a
supply
of
beans
or
of
coffee
and
sugar
for
parker
was
as
and
energetic
in
getting
food
for
his
men
as
we
prided
ourselves
upon
being
in
getting
food
for
ours
besides
he
got
oil
and
let
our
men
have
plenty
for
their
rifles
at
no
hour
of
the
day
or
night
was
parker
anywhere
but
where
we
wished
him
to
be
in
the
event
of
an
attack
if
i
was
ordered
to
send
a
troop
of
rough
riders
to
guard
some
road
or
some
break
in
the
lines
we
usually
got
parker
to
send
a
gatling
along
and
whether
the
change
was
made
by
day
or
by
night
the
gatling
went
over
any
ground
and
in
any
weather
he
never
exposed
the
gatlings
needlessly
or
unless
there
was
some
object
to
be
gained
but
if
serious
fighting
broke
out
he
always
took
a
hand
sometimes
this
fighting
would
be
the
result
of
an
effort
on
our
part
to
quell
the
fire
from
the
spanish
trenches
sometimes
the
spaniards
took
the
initiative
but
at
whatever
hour
of
the
serious
fighting
began
the
drumming
of
the
gatlings
was
soon
heard
through
the
cracking
of
our
own
carbines
i
have
spoken
thus
of
parker
gatling
detachment
how
can
i
speak
highly
enough
of
the
regular
cavalry
with
whom
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
serve
i
do
not
believe
that
in
any
army
of
the
world
could
be
found
a
more
gallant
and
soldierly
body
of
fighters
than
the
officers
and
men
of
the
first
third
sixth
ninth
and
tenth
united
states
cavalry
beside
whom
we
marched
to
victory
under
the
tropic
skies
of
santiago
the
american
regular
sets
the
standard
of
excellence
when
we
wish
to
give
the
utmost
possible
praise
to
a
volunteer
organization
we
say
that
it
is
as
good
as
the
regulars
i
was
exceedingly
proud
of
the
fact
that
the
regulars
treated
my
regiment
as
on
a
complete
equality
with
themselves
and
were
as
ready
to
see
it
in
a
post
of
danger
and
responsibility
as
to
see
any
of
their
own
battalions
lieutenant
colonel
dorst
a
man
from
whom
praise
meant
a
good
deal
christened
us
the
eleventh
united
states
horse
and
we
endeavored
i
think
i
may
say
successfully
to
show
that
we
deserved
the
title
by
our
conduct
not
only
in
fighting
and
in
marching
but
in
guarding
the
trenches
and
in
policing
camp
in
less
than
sixty
days
the
regiment
had
been
raised
organized
armed
equipped
drilled
mounted
dismounted
kept
for
a
fortnight
on
transports
and
put
through
two
victorious
aggressive
fights
in
very
difficult
country
the
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
amounting
to
a
quarter
of
those
engaged
this
is
a
record
which
it
is
not
easy
to
match
in
the
history
of
volunteer
organizations
the
loss
was
but
small
compared
to
that
which
befell
hundreds
of
regiments
in
some
of
the
great
battles
of
the
later
years
of
the
civil
war
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
there
was
any
regiment
which
made
such
a
record
during
the
first
months
of
any
of
our
wars
after
the
battle
of
san
juan
my
men
had
really
become
veterans
they
and
i
understood
each
other
perfectly
and
trusted
each
other
implicitly
they
knew
i
would
share
every
hardship
and
danger
with
them
would
do
everything
in
my
power
to
see
that
they
were
fed
and
so
far
as
might
be
sheltered
and
spared
and
in
return
i
knew
that
they
would
endure
every
kind
of
hardship
and
fatigue
without
a
murmur
and
face
every
danger
with
entire
fearlessness
i
felt
utter
confidence
in
them
and
would
have
been
more
than
willing
to
put
them
to
any
task
which
any
crack
regiment
of
the
world
at
home
or
abroad
could
perform
they
were
natural
fighters
men
of
great
intelligence
great
courage
great
hardihood
and
physical
prowess
and
i
could
draw
on
these
qualities
and
upon
their
spirit
of
ready
soldierly
obedience
to
make
up
for
any
deficiencies
in
the
technique
of
the
trade
which
they
had
temporarily
adopted
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
were
already
good
individual
fighters
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
horse
and
the
rifle
so
that
there
was
no
need
of
putting
them
through
the
kind
of
training
in
which
the
ordinary
raw
recruit
must
spend
his
first
year
or
two
on
july
as
the
day
wore
on
the
fight
though
raging
fitfully
at
intervals
gradually
died
away
the
spanish
guerillas
were
causing
us
much
trouble
they
showed
great
courage
exactly
as
did
their
soldiers
who
were
defending
the
trenches
in
fact
the
spaniards
throughout
showed
precisely
the
qualities
they
did
early
in
the
century
when
as
every
student
will
remember
their
fleets
were
a
helpless
prey
to
the
english
and
their
armies
utterly
unable
to
stand
in
the
open
against
those
of
napoleon
marshals
while
on
the
other
hand
their
guerillas
performed
marvellous
feats
and
their
defence
of
intrenchments
and
walled
towns
as
at
saragossa
and
gerona
were
the
wonder
of
the
civilized
world
in
our
front
their
crept
up
before
dawn
and
either
lay
in
the
thick
jungle
or
climbed
into
some
tree
with
dense
foliage
in
these
places
it
proved
almost
impossible
to
place
them
as
they
kept
cover
very
carefully
and
their
smokeless
powder
betrayed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
their
whereabouts
they
caused
us
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
and
some
little
loss
and
though
our
own
were
continually
taking
shots
at
the
places
where
they
supposed
them
to
be
and
though
occasionally
we
would
play
a
gatling
or
a
colt
all
through
the
top
of
a
suspicious
tree
i
but
twice
saw
spaniards
brought
down
out
of
their
perches
from
in
front
of
our
lines
on
each
occasion
the
fall
of
the
spaniard
being
hailed
with
loud
cheers
by
our
men
these
in
our
front
did
perfectly
legitimate
work
and
were
entitled
to
all
credit
for
their
courage
and
skill
it
was
different
with
the
guerillas
in
our
rear
quite
a
number
of
these
had
been
posted
in
trees
at
the
time
of
the
san
juan
fight
they
were
using
not
mausers
but
remingtons
which
shot
smokeless
powder
and
a
bullet
it
was
one
of
these
bullets
which
had
hit
winslow
clark
by
my
side
on
kettle
hill
and
though
for
fighting
the
remingtons
were
of
course
nothing
like
as
good
as
the
mausers
they
were
equally
serviceable
for
bush
work
as
they
used
smokeless
powder
when
our
troops
advanced
and
the
spaniards
in
the
trenches
and
in
reserve
behind
the
hill
fled
the
guerillas
in
the
trees
had
no
time
to
get
away
and
in
consequence
were
left
in
the
rear
of
our
lines
as
we
found
out
from
the
prisoners
we
took
the
spanish
officers
had
been
careful
to
instil
into
the
minds
of
their
soldiers
the
belief
that
the
americans
never
granted
quarter
and
i
suppose
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
that
the
guerillas
did
not
surrender
for
we
found
that
the
spaniards
were
anxious
enough
to
surrender
as
soon
as
they
became
convinced
that
we
would
treat
them
mercifully
at
any
rate
these
guerillas
kept
up
in
their
trees
and
showed
not
only
courage
but
wanton
cruelty
and
barbarity
at
times
they
fired
upon
armed
men
in
bodies
but
they
much
preferred
for
their
victims
the
unarmed
attendants
the
doctors
the
chaplains
the
hospital
stewards
they
fired
at
the
men
who
were
bearing
off
the
wounded
in
litters
they
fired
at
the
doctors
who
came
to
the
front
and
at
the
chaplains
who
started
to
hold
burial
service
the
conspicuous
red
cross
brassard
worn
by
all
of
these
instead
of
serving
as
a
protection
seemed
to
make
them
the
special
objects
of
the
guerilla
fire
so
annoying
did
they
become
that
i
sent
out
that
afternoon
and
next
morning
a
detail
of
picked
to
hunt
them
out
choosing
of
course
woodsmen
and
mountain
men
who
were
also
good
shots
my
felt
very
vindictively
toward
these
guerillas
and
showed
them
no
quarter
they
started
systematically
to
hunt
them
and
showed
themselves
much
superior
at
the
guerillas
own
game
killing
eleven
while
not
one
of
my
men
was
scratched
two
of
the
men
who
did
conspicuously
good
service
in
this
work
were
troopers
goodwin
and
proffit
both
of
arizona
but
one
by
birth
a
californian
and
the
other
a
north
carolinian
goodwin
was
a
natural
shot
not
only
with
the
rifle
and
revolver
but
with
the
sling
proffit
might
have
stood
as
a
type
of
the
mountaineers
described
by
john
fox
and
miss
murfree
he
was
a
tall
sinewy
handsome
man
of
remarkable
strength
an
excellent
shot
and
a
thoroughly
good
soldier
his
father
had
been
a
confederate
officer
rising
from
the
ranks
and
if
the
war
had
lasted
long
enough
the
son
would
have
risen
in
the
same
manner
as
it
was
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
given
him
a
commission
exactly
as
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
given
a
number
of
others
in
the
regiment
commissions
if
i
had
only
had
them
proffit
was
a
saturnine
reserved
man
who
afterward
fell
very
sick
with
the
fever
and
who
as
a
reward
for
his
soldierly
good
conduct
was
often
granted
unusual
privileges
but
he
took
the
fever
and
the
privileges
with
the
same
iron
indifference
never
grumbling
and
never
expressing
satisfaction
the
returned
by
nightfall
soon
afterward
i
established
my
pickets
and
outposts
well
to
the
front
in
the
jungle
so
as
to
prevent
all
possibility
of
surprise
after
dark
fires
suddenly
shot
up
on
the
mountain
passes
far
to
our
right
they
all
rose
together
and
we
could
make
nothing
of
them
after
a
good
deal
of
consultation
we
decided
they
must
be
some
signals
to
the
spaniards
in
santiago
from
the
troops
marching
to
reinforce
them
from
without
for
we
were
ignorant
that
the
reinforcements
had
already
reached
the
city
the
cubans
being
quite
unable
to
prevent
the
spanish
regulars
from
marching
wherever
they
wished
while
we
were
thus
pondering
over
the
and
attributing
them
to
spanish
machinations
of
some
sort
it
appears
that
the
spaniards
equally
puzzled
were
setting
them
down
as
an
attempt
at
communication
between
the
insurgents
and
our
army
both
sides
were
accordingly
on
the
alert
and
the
spaniards
must
have
strengthened
their
outlying
parties
in
the
jungle
ahead
of
us
for
they
suddenly
attacked
one
of
our
pickets
wounding
crockett
seriously
he
was
brought
in
by
the
other
troopers
evidently
the
spanish
lines
felt
a
little
nervous
for
this
sputter
of
shooting
was
immediately
followed
by
a
tremendous
fire
of
great
guns
and
rifles
from
their
trenches
and
batteries
our
men
in
the
trenches
responded
heavily
and
word
was
sent
back
not
only
to
me
but
to
the
commanders
in
the
rear
of
the
regiments
along
our
line
that
the
spaniards
were
attacking
it
was
imperative
to
see
what
was
really
going
on
so
i
ran
up
to
the
trenches
and
looked
out
at
night
it
was
far
easier
to
place
the
spanish
lines
than
by
day
because
the
shone
in
the
darkness
i
could
soon
tell
that
there
were
bodies
of
spanish
pickets
or
skirmishers
in
the
valley
between
their
lines
and
ours
but
that
the
bulk
of
the
fire
came
from
their
trenches
and
showed
not
the
slightest
symptom
of
advancing
moreover
as
is
generally
the
case
at
night
the
fire
was
almost
all
high
passing
well
overhead
with
an
occasional
bullet
near
by
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
use
in
our
firing
back
under
such
circumstances
and
i
could
tell
that
the
same
conclusion
had
been
reached
by
captain
ayres
of
the
tenth
cavalry
on
the
right
of
my
line
for
even
above
the
cracking
of
the
carbines
rose
the
captain
voice
as
with
varied
and
picturesque
language
he
bade
his
black
troopers
cease
firing
the
captain
was
as
absolutely
fearless
as
a
man
can
be
he
had
command
of
his
regimental
trenches
that
night
and
having
run
up
at
the
first
alarm
had
speedily
satisfied
himself
that
no
particular
purpose
was
served
by
blazing
away
in
the
dark
when
the
enormous
majority
of
the
spaniards
were
simply
shooting
at
random
from
their
own
trenches
and
if
they
ever
had
thought
of
advancing
had
certainly
given
up
the
idea
his
troopers
were
devoted
to
him
would
follow
him
anywhere
and
would
do
anything
he
said
but
when
men
get
firing
at
night
it
is
rather
difficult
to
stop
them
especially
when
the
fire
of
the
enemy
in
front
continues
unabated
when
he
first
reached
the
trenches
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
or
not
there
was
an
actual
night
attack
impending
and
he
had
been
instructing
his
men
as
i
instructed
mine
to
fire
low
cutting
the
grass
in
front
as
soon
as
he
became
convinced
that
there
was
no
night
attack
he
ran
up
and
down
the
line
adjuring
and
commanding
the
troopers
to
cease
shooting
with
words
and
phrases
which
were
doubtless
not
wholly
unlike
those
which
the
old
guard
really
did
use
at
waterloo
as
i
ran
down
my
own
line
i
could
see
him
coming
up
his
and
he
saved
me
all
trouble
in
stopping
the
fire
at
the
right
where
the
lines
met
for
my
men
there
all
dropped
everything
to
listen
to
him
and
cheer
and
laugh
soon
we
got
the
troopers
in
hand
and
made
them
cease
firing
then
after
awhile
the
spanish
fire
died
down
at
the
time
we
spoke
of
this
as
a
night
attack
by
the
spaniards
but
it
really
was
not
an
attack
at
all
ever
after
my
men
had
a
great
regard
for
ayres
and
would
have
followed
him
anywhere
i
shall
never
forget
the
way
in
which
he
scolded
his
huge
devoted
black
troopers
generally
ending
with
i
ashamed
of
you
ashamed
of
you
i
have
believed
it
firing
when
i
told
you
to
stop
i
ashamed
of
you
that
night
we
spent
in
perfecting
the
trenches
and
arranging
entrances
to
them
doing
about
as
much
work
as
we
had
the
preceding
night
greenway
and
goodrich
from
their
energy
eagerness
to
do
every
duty
and
great
physical
strength
were
peculiarly
useful
in
this
work
as
indeed
they
were
in
all
work
they
had
been
up
practically
the
entire
preceding
night
but
they
were
too
good
men
for
me
to
spare
them
nor
did
they
wish
to
be
spared
and
i
kept
them
up
all
this
night
too
goodrich
had
also
been
on
guard
as
officer
of
the
day
the
night
we
were
at
el
poso
so
that
it
turned
out
that
he
spent
nearly
four
days
and
three
nights
with
practically
hardly
any
sleep
at
all
next
morning
at
daybreak
the
firing
began
again
this
day
the
we
suffered
nothing
save
having
one
man
wounded
by
a
and
thanks
to
the
approaches
to
the
trenches
we
were
able
to
relieve
the
guards
without
any
difficulty
the
spanish
in
the
trees
and
jungle
nearby
however
annoyed
us
very
much
and
i
made
preparations
to
fix
them
next
day
with
this
end
in
view
i
chose
out
some
twenty
men
in
many
instances
the
same
that
i
had
sent
after
the
guerillas
and
arranged
that
each
should
take
his
canteen
and
a
little
food
they
were
to
slip
into
the
jungle
between
us
and
the
spanish
lines
before
dawn
next
morning
and
there
to
spend
the
day
getting
as
close
to
the
spanish
lines
as
possible
moving
about
with
great
stealth
and
picking
off
any
hostile
as
well
as
any
soldier
who
exposed
himself
in
the
trenches
i
had
plenty
of
men
who
possessed
a
training
in
woodcraft
that
fitted
them
for
this
work
and
as
soon
as
the
rumor
got
abroad
what
i
was
planning
volunteers
thronged
to
me
daniels
and
love
were
two
of
the
men
always
to
the
front
in
any
enterprise
of
this
nature
so
were
wadsworth
the
two
bulls
fortescue
and
cowdin
but
i
could
not
begin
to
name
all
the
troopers
who
so
eagerly
craved
the
chance
to
win
honor
out
of
hazard
and
danger
among
them
was
good
solemn
fred
herrig
the
alsatian
i
knew
patience
and
skill
as
a
hunter
from
the
trips
we
had
taken
together
after
deer
and
mountain
sheep
through
the
bad
lands
of
the
little
missouri
he
still
spoke
english
with
what
might
be
called
alsatian
variations
he
always
spoke
of
the
gun
detail
as
the
gondetle
with
the
accent
on
the
first
syllable
and
he
expressed
a
wish
to
be
allowed
a
holiday
from
the
gondetle
to
go
after
dem
gorrillas
i
told
him
he
could
have
the
holiday
but
to
his
great
disappointment
the
truce
came
first
and
then
fred
asked
that
inasmuch
as
the
gorrillas
were
now
forbidden
game
he
might
be
allowed
to
go
after
instead
even
after
the
truce
however
some
of
my
had
occupation
for
two
guerillas
in
our
rear
took
occasional
shots
at
the
men
who
were
bathing
in
a
pond
until
one
of
our
men
spied
them
when
they
were
both
speedily
brought
down
one
of
my
riflemen
who
did
best
at
this
kind
of
work
by
the
way
got
into
trouble
because
of
it
he
was
much
inflated
by
my
commendation
of
him
and
when
he
went
back
to
his
troop
he
declined
to
obey
the
first
sergeant
orders
on
the
ground
that
he
was
the
colonel
the
lieutenant
in
command
being
somewhat
puzzled
brought
him
to
me
and
i
had
to
explain
that
if
the
offence
disobedience
of
orders
in
face
of
the
enemy
was
repeated
he
might
incur
the
death
penalty
whereat
he
looked
very
crestfallen
that
afternoon
he
got
permission
like
fred
herrig
to
go
after
which
were
found
wild
in
some
numbers
round
about
and
he
sent
me
the
only
one
he
got
as
a
peace
offering
the
few
thus
procured
were
all
used
for
the
sick
church
had
established
a
little
field
hospital
under
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
in
our
rear
he
was
himself
very
sick
and
had
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
medicine
or
supplies
or
apparatus
of
any
kind
but
the
condition
of
the
wounded
in
the
big
field
hospitals
in
the
rear
was
so
horrible
from
the
lack
of
attendants
as
well
as
of
medicines
that
we
kept
all
the
men
we
possibly
could
at
the
front
some
of
them
had
now
begun
to
come
down
with
fever
they
were
all
very
patient
but
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
sick
and
wounded
soldiers
lying
on
their
blankets
if
they
had
any
and
if
not
then
simply
in
the
mud
with
nothing
to
eat
but
hardtack
and
pork
which
of
course
they
could
not
touch
when
their
fever
got
high
and
with
no
chance
to
get
more
than
the
rudest
attention
among
the
very
sick
here
was
gallant
captain
llewellen
i
feared
he
was
going
to
die
we
finally
had
to
send
him
to
one
of
the
big
hospitals
in
the
rear
doctors
brewer
and
fuller
of
the
tenth
had
been
unwearying
in
attending
to
the
wounded
including
many
of
those
of
my
regiment
at
twelve
we
were
notified
to
stop
firing
and
a
flag
of
truce
was
sent
in
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
city
the
negotiations
gave
us
a
breathing
spell
that
afternoon
i
arranged
to
get
our
baggage
up
sending
back
strong
details
of
men
to
carry
up
their
own
goods
and
as
usual
impressing
into
the
service
a
kind
of
improvised
consisting
of
the
officers
horses
of
two
or
three
captured
spanish
cavalry
horses
two
or
three
mules
which
had
been
shot
and
abandoned
and
which
our
men
had
taken
and
cured
and
two
or
three
cuban
ponies
hitherto
we
had
simply
been
sleeping
by
the
trenches
or
immediately
in
their
rear
with
nothing
in
the
way
of
shelter
and
only
one
blanket
to
every
three
or
four
men
fortunately
there
had
been
little
rain
we
now
got
up
the
shelter
tents
of
the
men
and
some
flies
for
the
hospital
and
for
the
officers
and
my
personal
baggage
appeared
i
celebrated
its
advent
by
a
thorough
wash
and
shave
later
i
twice
snatched
a
few
hours
to
go
to
the
rear
and
visit
such
of
my
men
as
i
could
find
in
the
hospitals
their
patience
was
extraordinary
kenneth
robinson
a
gallant
young
trooper
though
himself
severely
i
supposed
at
the
time
mortally
wounded
was
noteworthy
for
the
way
in
which
he
tended
those
among
the
wounded
who
were
even
more
helpless
and
the
cheery
courage
with
which
he
kept
up
their
spirits
gievers
who
was
shot
through
the
hips
rejoined
us
at
the
front
in
a
fortnight
captain
day
was
hardly
longer
away
jack
hammer
who
with
poor
race
smith
a
gallant
texas
lad
who
was
mortally
hurt
beside
me
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
had
been
on
kitchen
detail
was
wounded
and
sent
to
the
rear
he
was
ordered
to
go
to
the
united
states
but
he
heard
that
we
were
to
assault
santiago
so
he
struggled
out
to
rejoin
us
and
thereafter
stayed
at
the
front
cosby
badly
wounded
made
his
way
down
to
the
in
three
days
unassisted
with
all
volunteer
troops
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
with
regulars
too
in
time
of
trial
the
best
work
can
be
got
out
of
the
men
only
if
the
officers
endure
the
same
hardships
and
face
the
same
risks
in
my
regiment
as
in
the
whole
cavalry
division
the
proportion
of
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
considerably
greater
among
the
officers
than
among
the
troopers
and
this
was
exactly
as
it
should
be
moreover
when
we
got
down
to
hard
pan
we
all
officers
and
men
fared
exactly
alike
as
regards
both
shelter
and
food
this
prevented
any
grumbling
when
the
troopers
saw
that
the
officers
had
nothing
but
hardtack
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
regiment
who
would
not
have
been
ashamed
to
grumble
at
faring
no
worse
and
when
all
alike
slept
out
in
the
open
in
the
rear
of
the
trenches
and
when
the
men
always
saw
the
field
officers
up
at
night
during
the
digging
of
the
trenches
and
going
the
rounds
of
the
outposts
they
would
not
tolerate
in
any
of
their
number
either
complaint
or
shirking
work
when
things
got
easier
i
put
up
my
tent
and
lived
a
little
apart
for
it
is
a
mistake
for
an
officer
ever
to
grow
too
familiar
with
his
men
no
matter
how
good
they
are
and
it
is
of
course
the
greatest
possible
mistake
to
seek
popularity
either
by
showing
weakness
or
by
mollycoddling
the
men
they
will
never
respect
a
commander
who
does
not
enforce
discipline
who
does
not
know
his
duty
and
who
is
not
willing
both
himself
to
encounter
and
to
make
them
encounter
every
species
of
danger
and
hardship
when
necessary
the
soldiers
who
do
not
feel
this
way
are
not
worthy
of
the
name
and
should
be
handled
with
iron
severity
until
they
become
fighting
men
and
not
shams
in
return
the
officer
should
carefully
look
after
his
men
should
see
that
they
are
well
fed
and
well
sheltered
and
that
no
matter
how
much
they
may
grumble
they
keep
the
camp
thoroughly
policed
after
the
cessation
of
the
three
days
fighting
we
began
to
get
our
rations
regularly
and
had
plenty
of
hardtack
and
salt
pork
and
usually
about
half
the
ordinary
amount
of
sugar
and
coffee
it
was
not
a
very
good
ration
for
the
tropics
however
and
was
of
very
little
use
indeed
to
the
sick
and
on
two
or
three
occasions
during
the
siege
i
got
my
improvised
together
and
either
took
or
sent
it
down
to
the
for
beans
canned
tomatoes
and
the
like
we
got
these
either
from
the
transports
which
were
still
landing
stores
on
the
beach
or
from
the
red
cross
if
i
did
not
go
myself
i
sent
some
man
who
had
shown
that
he
was
a
driving
energetic
tactful
fellow
who
would
somehow
get
what
we
wanted
chaplain
brown
developed
great
capacity
in
this
line
and
so
did
one
of
the
troopers
named
knoblauch
he
who
had
dived
after
the
rifles
that
had
sunk
off
the
pier
at
daiquiri
the
supplies
of
food
we
got
in
this
way
had
a
very
beneficial
effect
not
only
upon
the
men
health
but
upon
their
spirits
to
the
red
cross
and
similar
charitable
organizations
we
owe
a
great
deal
we
also
owed
much
to
colonel
weston
of
the
commissary
department
who
always
helped
us
and
never
let
himself
be
hindered
by
red
tape
thus
he
always
let
me
violate
the
absurd
regulation
which
forbade
me
even
in
war
time
to
purchase
food
for
my
men
from
the
stores
although
letting
me
purchase
for
the
officers
i
of
course
paid
no
heed
to
the
regulation
when
by
violating
it
i
could
get
beans
canned
tomatoes
or
tobacco
sometimes
i
used
my
own
money
sometimes
what
was
given
me
by
woody
kane
or
what
was
sent
me
by
my
douglas
robinson
or
by
the
other
red
cross
people
in
new
york
my
regiment
did
not
fare
very
well
but
i
think
it
fared
better
than
any
other
of
course
no
one
would
have
minded
in
the
least
such
hardships
as
we
endured
had
there
been
any
need
of
enduring
them
but
there
was
none
system
and
sufficiency
of
transportation
were
all
that
were
needed
on
one
occasion
a
foreign
military
attache
visited
my
together
with
a
foreign
correspondent
who
had
been
through
the
war
they
were
both
most
friendly
critics
and
as
they
knew
i
was
aware
of
this
the
correspondent
finally
ventured
the
remark
that
he
thought
our
soldiers
fought
even
better
than
the
turks
but
that
on
the
whole
our
system
of
military
administration
seemed
rather
worse
than
that
of
the
greeks
as
a
nation
we
had
prided
ourselves
on
our
business
ability
and
adroitness
in
the
arts
of
peace
while
outsiders
at
any
rate
did
not
credit
us
with
any
especial
warlike
prowess
and
it
was
curious
that
when
war
came
we
should
have
broken
down
precisely
on
the
business
and
administrative
side
while
the
fighting
edge
of
the
troops
certainly
left
little
to
be
desired
i
was
very
much
touched
by
the
devotion
my
men
showed
to
me
after
they
had
once
become
convinced
that
i
would
share
their
hardships
they
made
it
a
point
that
i
should
not
suffer
any
hardships
at
all
and
i
really
had
an
extremely
easy
time
whether
i
had
any
food
or
not
myself
made
no
difference
as
there
were
sure
to
be
certain
troopers
and
indeed
certain
troop
messes
on
the
lookout
for
me
if
they
had
any
beans
they
would
send
me
over
a
cupful
or
i
would
suddenly
receive
a
present
of
doughnuts
from
some
cook
who
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
little
flour
and
sugar
and
if
a
man
shot
a
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
make
him
keep
half
of
it
for
himself
wright
the
color
sergeant
and
henry
bardshar
my
orderly
always
pitched
and
struck
my
tent
and
built
me
a
bunk
of
bamboo
poles
whenever
we
changed
camp
so
i
personally
endured
very
little
discomfort
for
of
course
no
one
minded
the
two
or
three
days
preceding
or
following
each
fight
when
we
all
had
to
get
along
as
best
we
could
indeed
as
long
as
we
were
under
fire
or
in
the
immediate
presence
of
the
enemy
and
i
had
plenty
to
do
there
was
nothing
of
which
i
could
legitimately
complain
and
what
i
really
did
regard
as
hardships
my
men
did
not
object
to
for
later
on
when
we
had
some
leisure
i
would
have
given
much
for
complete
solitude
and
some
good
books
whether
there
was
a
truce
or
whether
as
sometimes
happened
we
were
notified
that
there
was
no
truce
but
merely
a
further
cessation
of
hostilities
by
tacit
agreement
or
whether
the
fight
was
on
we
kept
equally
vigilant
watch
especially
at
night
in
the
trenches
every
fourth
man
kept
awake
the
others
sleeping
beside
or
behind
him
on
their
rifles
and
the
cossack
posts
and
pickets
were
pushed
out
in
advance
beyond
the
edge
of
the
jungle
at
least
once
a
night
at
some
irregular
hour
i
tried
to
visit
every
part
of
our
line
especially
if
it
was
dark
and
rainy
although
sometimes
when
the
lines
were
in
charge
of
some
officer
like
wilcox
or
kane
greenway
or
goodrich
i
became
lazy
took
off
my
boots
and
slept
all
night
through
sometimes
at
night
i
went
not
only
along
the
lines
of
our
own
brigade
but
of
the
brigades
adjoining
it
was
a
matter
of
pride
not
only
with
me
but
with
all
our
men
that
the
lines
occupied
by
the
rough
riders
should
be
at
least
as
vigilantly
guarded
as
the
lines
of
any
regular
regiment
sometimes
at
night
when
i
met
other
officers
inspecting
their
lines
we
would
sit
and
talk
over
matters
and
wonder
what
shape
the
outcome
of
the
siege
would
take
we
knew
we
would
capture
santiago
but
exactly
how
we
would
do
it
we
could
not
tell
the
failure
to
establish
any
depot
for
provisions
on
the
where
there
was
hardly
ever
more
than
hours
food
ahead
made
the
risk
very
serious
if
a
hurricane
had
struck
the
transports
scattering
them
to
the
four
winds
or
if
three
days
of
heavy
rain
had
completely
broken
up
our
communication
as
they
assuredly
would
have
done
we
would
have
been
at
starvation
point
on
the
front
and
while
of
course
we
would
have
lived
through
it
somehow
and
would
have
taken
the
city
it
would
only
have
been
after
very
disagreeable
experiences
as
soon
as
i
was
able
i
accumulated
for
my
own
regiment
about
hours
hardtack
and
salt
pork
which
i
kept
so
far
as
possible
intact
to
provide
against
any
emergency
if
the
city
could
be
taken
without
direct
assault
on
the
intrenchments
and
wire
entanglements
we
earnestly
hoped
it
would
be
for
such
an
assault
meant
as
we
knew
by
past
experience
the
loss
of
a
quarter
of
the
attacking
regiments
and
we
were
bound
that
the
rough
riders
should
be
one
of
these
attacking
regiments
if
the
attack
had
to
be
made
there
was
of
course
nobody
who
would
not
rather
have
assaulted
than
have
run
the
risk
of
failure
but
we
hoped
the
city
would
fall
without
need
arising
for
us
to
suffer
the
great
loss
of
life
which
a
further
assault
would
have
entailed
naturally
the
colonels
and
captains
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
peace
negotiations
which
dragged
along
for
the
week
following
the
sending
in
the
flag
of
truce
each
day
we
expected
either
to
see
the
city
surrender
or
to
be
told
to
begin
fighting
again
and
toward
the
end
it
grew
so
irksome
that
we
would
have
welcomed
even
an
assault
in
preference
to
further
inaction
i
used
to
discuss
matters
with
the
officers
of
my
own
regiment
now
and
then
and
with
a
few
of
the
officers
of
the
neighboring
regiments
with
whom
i
had
struck
up
a
friendship
parker
stevens
beck
ayres
morton
and
boughton
i
also
saw
a
good
deal
of
the
excellent
officers
on
the
staffs
of
generals
wheeler
and
sumner
especially
colonel
dorst
colonel
garlington
captain
howze
captain
steele
lieutenant
andrews
and
captain
astor
chanler
who
like
myself
was
a
volunteer
chanler
was
an
old
friend
and
a
fellow
hunter
who
had
done
some
good
exploring
work
in
africa
i
always
wished
i
could
have
had
him
in
my
regiment
as
for
dorst
he
was
peculiarly
fitted
to
command
a
regiment
although
howze
and
andrews
were
not
in
my
brigade
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
them
especially
of
howze
who
would
have
made
a
nearly
ideal
regimental
commander
they
were
both
natural
and
of
most
enterprising
natures
ever
desirous
of
pushing
to
the
front
and
of
taking
the
boldest
course
the
view
howze
always
took
of
every
emergency
a
view
which
found
prompt
expression
in
his
actions
when
the
opportunity
offered
made
me
feel
like
an
elderly
conservative
the
week
of
was
not
all
a
period
of
truce
part
of
the
time
was
passed
under
a
kind
of
nondescript
arrangement
when
we
were
told
not
to
attack
ourselves
but
to
be
ready
at
any
moment
to
repulse
an
attack
and
to
make
preparations
for
meeting
it
during
these
times
i
busied
myself
in
putting
our
trenches
into
shape
and
in
building
and
traverses
one
night
i
got
a
detail
of
sixty
men
from
the
first
ninth
and
tenth
whose
officers
always
helped
us
in
every
way
and
with
these
and
with
sixty
of
my
own
men
i
dug
a
long
zigzag
trench
in
advance
of
the
salient
of
my
line
out
to
a
knoll
well
in
front
from
which
we
could
command
the
spanish
trenches
and
immediately
ahead
of
us
on
this
knoll
we
made
a
kind
of
bastion
consisting
of
a
deep
trench
with
arranged
along
the
edge
so
as
to
constitute
a
wall
with
of
course
when
i
came
to
dig
this
trench
i
kept
both
greenway
and
goodrich
supervising
the
work
all
night
and
equally
of
course
i
got
parker
and
stevens
to
help
me
by
employing
as
many
men
as
we
did
we
were
able
to
get
the
work
so
far
advanced
as
to
provide
against
interruption
before
the
moon
rose
which
was
about
midnight
our
pickets
were
thrown
far
out
in
the
jungle
to
keep
back
the
spanish
pickets
and
prevent
any
interference
with
the
diggers
the
men
seemed
to
think
the
work
rather
good
fun
than
otherwise
the
possibility
of
a
brush
with
the
spaniards
lending
a
zest
that
prevented
its
growing
monotonous
parker
had
taken
two
of
his
gatlings
removed
the
wheels
and
mounted
them
in
the
trenches
also
mounting
the
two
automatic
colts
where
he
deemed
they
could
do
best
service
with
the
completion
of
the
trenches
and
traverses
and
the
mounting
of
these
guns
the
fortifications
of
the
hill
assumed
quite
a
respectable
character
and
the
gatling
men
christened
it
fort
roosevelt
by
which
name
it
afterward
went
note
see
parker
with
the
gatlings
at
santiago
during
the
truce
various
military
attaches
and
foreign
officers
came
out
to
visit
us
two
or
three
of
the
newspaper
men
including
richard
harding
davis
caspar
whitney
and
john
fox
had
already
been
out
to
see
us
and
had
been
in
the
trenches
during
the
firing
among
the
others
were
captains
lee
and
paget
of
the
british
army
and
navy
fine
fellows
who
really
seemed
to
take
as
much
pride
in
the
feats
of
our
men
as
if
we
had
been
bound
together
by
the
ties
of
a
common
nationality
instead
of
the
ties
of
race
and
speech
kinship
another
english
visitor
was
sir
bryan
leighton
a
guest
for
he
most
thoughtfully
brought
to
me
half
a
dozen
little
jars
of
devilled
ham
and
potted
fruit
which
enabled
me
to
summon
various
officers
down
to
my
tent
and
hold
a
feast
count
von
gotzen
and
a
norwegian
attache
gedde
very
good
fellows
both
were
also
out
one
day
we
were
visited
by
a
travelling
russian
prince
a
large
blond
man
smooth
and
impenetrable
i
introduced
him
to
one
of
the
regular
army
officers
a
capital
fighter
and
excellent
fellow
who
however
viewed
foreign
international
politics
from
a
strictly
he
hailed
the
russian
with
frank
kindness
and
took
him
off
to
show
him
around
the
trenches
chatting
volubly
and
calling
him
prince
much
as
kentuckians
call
one
another
colonel
as
i
returned
i
heard
him
remarking
you
see
prince
the
great
result
of
this
war
is
that
it
has
united
the
two
branches
of
the
people
and
now
that
they
are
together
they
can
whip
the
world
prince
they
can
whip
the
world
being
evidently
filled
with
the
pleasing
belief
that
the
russian
would
cordially
sympathize
with
this
view
the
foreign
attaches
did
not
always
get
on
well
with
our
generals
the
two
english
representatives
never
had
any
trouble
were
heartily
admired
by
everybody
and
indeed
were
generally
treated
as
if
they
were
of
our
own
number
and
seemingly
so
regarded
themselves
but
this
was
not
always
true
of
the
representatives
from
continental
europe
one
of
the
latter
a
very
good
fellow
by
the
way
had
not
altogether
approved
of
the
way
he
was
treated
and
the
climax
came
when
he
said
to
the
general
who
had
special
charge
of
him
the
general
in
question
was
not
accustomed
to
nice
ethnic
distinctions
and
grouped
all
of
the
representatives
from
continental
europe
under
the
comprehensive
title
of
dutchmen
when
the
attache
in
question
came
to
say
farewell
the
general
responded
with
a
bluff
heartiness
in
which
perhaps
the
note
of
sincerity
was
more
conspicuous
than
that
of
entire
good
breeding
well
sorry
you
going
which
are
you
anyhow
the
german
or
the
russian
shortly
after
midday
on
the
fighting
began
again
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
spaniards
did
not
have
much
heart
in
it
the
american
field
artillery
was
now
under
the
command
of
general
randolph
and
he
fought
it
effectively
a
mortar
battery
had
also
been
established
though
with
an
utterly
inadequate
supply
of
ammunition
and
this
rendered
some
service
almost
the
only
rough
riders
who
had
a
chance
to
do
much
firing
were
the
men
with
the
colt
automatic
guns
and
the
twenty
picked
who
were
placed
in
the
newly
dug
little
fort
out
at
the
extreme
front
parker
had
a
splendid
time
with
the
gatlings
and
the
colts
with
these
machine
guns
he
completely
silenced
the
battery
in
front
of
us
this
battery
had
caused
us
a
good
deal
of
trouble
at
first
as
we
could
not
place
it
it
was
immediately
in
front
of
the
hospital
from
which
many
red
cross
flags
were
flying
one
of
them
floating
just
above
this
battery
from
where
we
looked
at
it
in
consequence
for
some
time
we
did
not
know
it
was
a
hostile
battery
at
all
as
like
all
the
other
spanish
batteries
it
was
using
smokeless
powder
it
was
only
by
the
aid
of
powerful
glasses
that
we
finally
discovered
its
real
nature
the
gatlings
and
colts
then
actually
put
it
out
of
action
silencing
the
big
guns
and
the
two
furthermore
the
machine
guns
and
our
together
did
good
work
in
supplementing
the
effects
of
the
dynamite
gun
for
when
a
shell
from
the
latter
struck
near
a
spanish
trench
or
a
building
in
which
there
were
spanish
troops
the
shock
was
seemingly
so
great
that
the
spaniards
almost
always
showed
themselves
and
gave
our
men
a
chance
to
do
some
execution
as
the
evening
of
the
came
on
the
men
began
to
make
their
coffee
in
sheltered
places
by
this
time
they
knew
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
so
well
that
not
a
man
was
touched
by
the
spaniards
during
the
second
bombardment
while
i
was
lying
with
the
officers
just
outside
one
of
the
i
saw
a
new
mexican
trooper
named
morrison
making
his
coffee
under
the
protection
of
a
traverse
high
up
on
the
hill
morrison
was
originally
a
baptist
preacher
who
had
joined
the
regiment
purely
from
a
sense
of
duty
leaving
his
wife
and
children
and
had
shown
himself
to
be
an
excellent
soldier
he
had
evidently
exactly
calculated
the
danger
zone
and
found
that
by
getting
close
to
the
traverse
he
could
sit
up
erect
and
make
ready
his
supper
without
being
cramped
i
watched
him
solemnly
pounding
the
coffee
with
the
butt
end
of
his
revolver
and
then
boiling
the
water
and
frying
his
bacon
just
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
lee
of
the
roundup
wagon
somewhere
out
on
the
plains
by
noon
of
next
day
the
my
regiment
with
one
of
the
gatlings
was
shifted
over
to
the
right
to
guard
the
caney
road
we
did
no
fighting
in
our
new
position
for
the
last
straggling
shot
had
been
fired
by
the
time
we
got
there
that
evening
there
came
up
the
worst
storm
we
had
had
and
by
midnight
my
tent
blew
over
i
had
for
the
first
time
in
a
fortnight
undressed
myself
completely
and
i
felt
fully
punished
for
my
love
of
luxury
when
i
jumped
out
into
the
driving
downpour
of
tropic
rain
and
groped
blindly
in
the
darkness
for
my
clothes
as
they
lay
in
the
liquid
mud
it
was
kane
night
on
guard
and
i
knew
the
wretched
woody
would
be
out
along
the
line
and
taking
care
of
the
pickets
no
matter
what
the
storm
might
be
and
so
i
basely
made
my
way
to
the
kitchen
tent
where
good
holderman
the
cherokee
wrapped
me
in
dry
blankets
and
put
me
to
sleep
on
a
table
which
he
had
just
procured
from
an
abandoned
spanish
house
on
the
the
city
formally
surrendered
and
our
regiment
like
the
rest
of
the
army
was
drawn
up
on
the
trenches
when
the
american
flag
was
hoisted
the
trumpets
blared
and
the
men
cheered
and
we
knew
that
the
fighting
part
of
our
work
was
over
shortly
after
we
took
our
new
position
the
first
illinois
volunteers
came
up
on
our
right
the
next
day
as
a
result
of
the
storm
and
of
further
rain
the
rivers
were
up
and
the
roads
quagmires
so
that
hardly
any
food
reached
the
front
my
regiment
was
all
right
as
we
had
provided
for
just
such
an
emergency
but
the
illinois
newcomers
had
of
course
not
done
so
and
they
were
literally
without
anything
to
eat
they
were
fine
fellows
and
we
could
not
see
them
suffer
i
furnished
them
some
beans
and
coffee
for
the
elder
officers
and
two
or
three
cases
of
hardtack
for
the
men
and
then
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
down
to
half
fording
half
swimming
the
streams
and
late
in
the
evening
i
succeeded
in
getting
half
a
of
provisions
for
them
on
the
morning
of
the
the
spaniards
had
sent
out
of
santiago
many
thousands
of
women
children
and
other
most
of
them
belonging
to
the
poorer
classes
but
among
them
not
a
few
of
the
best
families
these
wretched
creatures
took
very
little
with
them
they
came
through
our
lines
and
for
the
most
part
went
to
el
caney
in
our
rear
where
we
had
to
feed
them
and
protect
them
from
the
cubans
as
we
had
barely
enough
food
for
our
own
men
the
rations
of
the
refugees
were
scanty
indeed
and
their
sufferings
great
long
before
the
surrender
they
had
begun
to
come
to
our
lines
to
ask
for
provisions
and
my
men
gave
them
a
good
deal
out
of
their
own
scanty
stores
until
i
had
positively
to
forbid
it
and
to
insist
that
the
refugees
should
go
to
as
however
hard
and
merciless
it
seemed
i
was
in
duty
bound
to
keep
my
own
regiment
at
the
highest
pitch
of
fighting
efficiency
as
soon
as
the
surrender
was
assured
the
refugees
came
streaming
back
in
an
endless
squalid
procession
down
the
caney
road
to
santiago
my
troopers
for
all
their
roughness
and
their
ferocity
in
fight
were
rather
than
otherwise
and
they
helped
the
poor
creatures
especially
the
women
and
children
in
every
way
giving
them
food
and
even
carrying
the
children
and
the
burdens
borne
by
the
women
i
saw
one
man
happy
jack
spend
the
entire
day
in
walking
to
and
fro
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
both
sides
of
our
lines
along
the
road
carrying
the
bundles
for
a
series
of
poor
old
women
or
else
carrying
young
children
finally
the
doctor
warned
us
that
we
must
not
touch
the
bundles
of
the
refugees
for
fear
of
infection
as
disease
had
broken
out
and
was
rife
among
them
accordingly
i
had
to
put
a
stop
to
these
acts
of
kindness
on
the
part
of
my
men
against
which
action
happy
jack
respectfully
but
strongly
protested
upon
the
unexpected
ground
that
the
almighty
would
never
let
a
man
catch
a
disease
while
he
was
doing
a
good
action
i
did
not
venture
to
take
so
advanced
a
theological
stand
vi
the
return
home
two
or
three
days
after
the
surrender
the
cavalry
division
was
marched
back
to
the
foothills
west
of
el
caney
and
there
went
into
camp
together
with
the
artillery
it
was
a
most
beautiful
spot
beside
a
stream
of
clear
water
but
it
was
not
healthy
in
fact
no
ground
in
the
neighborhood
was
healthy
for
the
tropics
the
climate
was
not
bad
and
i
have
no
question
but
that
a
man
who
was
able
to
take
good
care
of
himself
could
live
there
all
the
year
round
with
comparative
impunity
but
the
case
was
entirely
different
with
an
army
which
was
obliged
to
suffer
great
exposure
and
to
live
under
conditions
which
almost
insured
being
attacked
by
the
severe
malarial
fever
of
the
country
my
own
men
were
already
suffering
badly
from
fever
and
they
got
worse
rather
than
better
in
the
new
camp
the
same
was
true
of
the
other
regiments
in
the
cavalry
division
a
curious
feature
was
that
the
colored
troops
seemed
to
suffer
as
heavily
as
the
white
from
week
to
week
there
were
slight
relative
changes
but
on
the
average
all
the
six
cavalry
regiments
the
rough
riders
the
white
regulars
and
the
colored
regulars
seemed
to
suffer
about
alike
and
we
were
all
very
much
weakened
about
as
much
as
the
regular
infantry
although
naturally
not
as
much
as
the
volunteer
infantry
yet
even
under
such
circumstances
adventurous
spirits
managed
to
make
their
way
out
to
us
in
the
fortnight
following
the
last
bombardment
of
the
city
i
enlisted
no
less
than
nine
such
recruits
six
being
from
harvard
yale
or
princeton
and
bull
the
former
harvard
oar
who
had
been
back
to
the
states
crippled
after
the
first
fight
actually
got
back
to
us
as
a
stowaway
on
one
of
the
transports
bound
to
share
the
luck
of
the
regiment
even
if
it
meant
yellow
fever
there
were
but
twelve
ambulances
with
the
army
and
these
were
quite
inadequate
for
their
work
but
the
conditions
in
the
large
field
hospitals
were
so
bad
that
as
long
as
possible
we
kept
all
of
our
sick
men
in
the
regimental
hospital
at
the
front
church
did
splendid
work
although
he
himself
was
suffering
much
more
than
half
the
time
from
fever
several
of
the
men
from
the
ranks
did
equally
well
especially
a
young
doctor
from
new
york
harry
thorpe
who
had
enlisted
as
a
trooper
but
who
was
now
made
acting
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
church
and
thorpe
were
able
to
get
proper
medicine
for
the
sick
and
it
was
almost
the
last
day
of
our
stay
before
we
were
able
to
get
cots
for
them
up
to
that
time
they
lay
on
the
ground
no
food
was
issued
suitable
for
them
or
for
the
men
who
were
not
on
the
doctor
list
the
two
classes
by
this
time
included
the
bulk
of
the
command
occasionally
we
got
hold
of
a
wagon
or
of
some
cuban
carts
and
at
other
times
i
used
my
improvised
the
animals
of
which
however
were
continually
being
taken
away
from
us
by
our
superiors
and
went
or
sent
back
to
the
at
siboney
or
into
santiago
itself
to
get
rice
flour
cornmeal
oatmeal
condensed
milk
potatoes
and
canned
vegetables
the
rice
i
bought
in
santiago
the
best
of
the
other
stuff
i
got
from
the
red
cross
through
george
kennan
and
miss
clara
barton
and
dr
lesser
but
some
of
it
i
got
from
our
own
transports
colonel
weston
the
as
always
rendered
us
every
service
in
his
power
this
additional
and
varied
food
was
of
the
utmost
service
not
merely
to
the
sick
but
in
preventing
the
well
from
becoming
sick
throughout
the
campaign
the
division
garlington
and
lieutenants
west
and
dickman
the
acting
division
quartermaster
and
commissary
had
done
everything
in
their
power
to
keep
us
supplied
with
food
but
where
there
were
so
few
mules
and
wagons
even
such
able
and
zealous
officers
could
not
do
the
impossible
we
had
the
camp
policed
thoroughly
and
i
made
the
men
build
little
bunks
of
poles
to
sleep
on
by
july
when
we
had
been
ashore
a
month
we
were
able
to
get
fresh
meat
and
from
that
time
on
we
fared
well
but
the
men
were
already
sickening
the
chief
trouble
was
the
malarial
fever
which
was
recurrent
for
a
few
days
the
man
would
be
very
sick
indeed
then
he
would
partially
recover
and
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
but
after
a
little
time
he
would
be
again
struck
down
every
officer
other
than
myself
except
one
was
down
with
sickness
at
one
time
or
another
even
greenway
and
goodrich
succumbed
to
the
fever
and
were
knocked
out
for
a
few
days
very
few
of
the
men
indeed
retained
their
strength
and
energy
and
though
the
percentage
actually
on
the
sick
list
never
got
over
twenty
there
were
less
than
fifty
per
cent
who
were
fit
for
any
kind
of
work
all
the
clothes
were
in
rags
even
the
officers
had
neither
socks
nor
underwear
the
lithe
college
athletes
had
lost
their
spring
the
tall
gaunt
hunters
and
lounged
listlessly
in
their
which
were
steaming
morasses
during
the
torrential
rains
and
then
ovens
when
the
sun
blazed
down
but
there
were
no
complaints
through
some
blunder
our
march
from
the
intrenchments
to
the
camp
on
the
foothills
after
the
surrender
was
made
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
though
it
was
only
some
five
miles
or
thereabouts
very
nearly
half
the
men
of
the
cavalry
division
dropped
out
captain
llewellen
had
come
back
and
led
his
troop
on
the
march
he
carried
a
pick
and
shovel
for
one
of
his
sick
men
and
after
we
reached
camp
walked
back
with
a
mule
to
get
another
trooper
who
had
fallen
out
from
heat
exhaustion
the
result
was
that
the
captain
himself
went
down
and
became
exceedingly
sick
we
at
last
succeeded
in
sending
him
to
the
states
i
never
thought
he
would
live
but
he
did
and
when
i
met
him
again
at
montauk
point
he
had
practically
entirely
recovered
my
orderly
henry
bardshar
was
struck
down
and
though
he
ultimately
recovered
he
was
a
mere
skeleton
having
lost
over
eighty
pounds
yellow
fever
also
broke
out
in
the
rear
chiefly
among
the
cubans
it
never
became
epidemic
but
it
caused
a
perfect
panic
among
some
of
our
own
doctors
and
especially
in
the
minds
of
one
or
two
generals
and
of
the
home
authorities
we
found
that
whenever
we
sent
a
man
to
the
rear
he
was
decreed
to
have
yellow
fever
whereas
if
we
kept
him
at
the
front
it
always
turned
out
that
he
had
malarial
fever
and
after
a
few
days
he
was
back
at
work
again
i
doubt
if
there
were
ever
more
than
a
dozen
genuine
cases
of
yellow
fever
in
the
whole
cavalry
division
but
the
authorities
at
washington
misled
by
the
reports
they
received
from
one
or
two
of
their
military
and
medical
advisers
at
the
front
became
and
under
the
influence
of
their
fears
hesitated
to
bring
the
army
home
lest
it
might
import
yellow
fever
into
the
united
states
their
panic
was
absolutely
groundless
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
brought
home
not
a
single
case
of
yellow
fever
developed
upon
american
soil
our
real
foe
was
not
the
yellow
fever
at
all
but
malarial
fever
which
was
not
infectious
but
which
was
certain
if
the
troops
were
left
throughout
the
summer
in
cuba
to
destroy
them
either
killing
them
outright
or
weakening
them
so
that
they
would
have
fallen
victims
to
any
disease
that
attacked
them
however
for
a
time
our
prospects
were
gloomy
as
the
washington
authorities
seemed
determined
that
we
should
stay
in
cuba
they
unfortunately
knew
nothing
of
the
country
nor
of
the
circumstances
of
the
army
and
the
plans
that
were
from
time
to
time
formulated
in
the
department
and
even
by
an
occasional
general
or
surgeon
at
the
front
for
the
management
of
the
army
would
have
been
comic
if
they
had
not
possessed
such
tragic
possibilities
thus
at
one
period
it
was
proposed
that
we
should
shift
camp
every
two
or
three
days
now
our
transportation
as
i
have
pointed
out
before
was
utterly
inadequate
in
theory
under
the
regulations
of
the
war
department
each
regiment
should
have
had
at
least
wagons
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
regiment
often
had
none
sometimes
one
rarely
two
and
never
three
yet
it
was
better
off
than
any
other
in
the
cavalry
division
in
consequence
it
was
impossible
to
carry
much
of
anything
save
what
the
men
had
on
their
backs
and
half
of
the
men
were
too
weak
to
walk
three
miles
with
their
packs
whenever
we
shifted
camp
the
exertion
among
the
caused
our
to
double
next
morning
and
it
took
at
least
three
days
even
when
the
shift
was
for
but
a
short
distance
before
we
were
able
to
bring
up
the
officers
luggage
the
hospital
spare
food
the
ammunition
etc
meanwhile
the
officers
slept
wherever
they
could
and
those
men
who
had
not
been
able
to
carry
their
own
bedding
slept
as
the
officers
did
in
the
weak
condition
of
the
men
the
labor
of
pitching
camp
was
severe
and
told
heavily
upon
them
in
short
the
scheme
of
continually
shifting
camp
was
impossible
of
fulfilment
it
would
merely
have
resulted
in
the
early
destruction
of
the
army
again
it
was
proposed
that
we
should
go
up
the
mountains
and
make
our
camps
there
the
palm
and
the
bamboo
grew
to
the
summits
of
the
mountains
and
the
soil
along
their
sides
was
deep
and
soft
while
the
rains
were
very
heavy
much
more
so
than
immediately
on
the
coast
every
mile
or
two
inland
bringing
with
it
a
great
increase
in
the
rainfall
we
could
with
much
difficulty
have
got
our
regiments
up
the
mountains
but
not
half
the
men
could
have
got
up
with
their
belongings
and
once
there
it
would
have
been
an
impossibility
to
feed
them
it
was
all
that
could
be
done
with
the
limited
number
of
wagons
and
on
hand
to
feed
the
men
in
the
existing
camps
for
the
travel
and
the
rain
gradually
rendered
each
road
in
succession
wholly
impassable
to
have
gone
up
the
mountains
would
have
meant
early
starvation
the
third
plan
of
the
department
was
even
more
objectionable
than
either
of
the
others
there
was
some
miles
in
the
interior
what
was
called
a
high
interior
plateau
and
at
one
period
we
were
informed
that
we
were
to
be
marched
thither
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
high
plateau
was
the
country
where
during
the
summer
the
rainfall
was
prodigious
it
was
a
rich
deep
soil
covered
with
a
rank
tropic
growth
the
being
higher
than
the
head
of
a
man
on
horseback
it
was
a
perfect
hotbed
of
malaria
and
there
was
no
dry
ground
whatever
in
which
to
camp
to
have
sent
the
troops
there
would
have
been
simple
butchery
under
these
circumstances
the
alternative
to
leaving
the
country
altogether
was
to
stay
where
we
were
with
the
hope
that
half
the
men
would
live
through
to
the
cool
season
we
did
everything
possible
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
the
men
but
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
because
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
they
were
weak
and
languid
and
in
the
wet
heat
they
had
lost
energy
so
that
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
indulge
in
sports
or
pastimes
there
were
exceptions
but
the
average
man
who
went
off
to
shoot
or
tried
some
vigorous
game
always
felt
much
the
worse
for
his
exertions
once
or
twice
i
took
some
of
my
comrades
with
me
and
climbed
up
one
or
another
of
the
surrounding
mountains
but
the
result
generally
was
that
half
of
the
party
were
down
with
some
kind
of
sickness
next
day
it
was
impossible
to
take
heavy
exercise
in
the
heat
of
the
day
the
evening
usually
saw
a
which
made
the
country
a
quagmire
and
in
the
early
morning
the
drenching
dew
and
wet
slimy
soil
made
walking
but
little
pleasure
chaplain
brown
held
service
every
sunday
under
a
low
tree
outside
my
tent
and
we
always
had
a
congregation
of
a
few
score
troopers
lying
or
sitting
round
their
strong
hard
faces
turned
toward
the
preacher
i
let
a
few
of
the
men
visit
santiago
but
the
long
walk
in
and
out
was
very
tiring
and
moreover
wise
restrictions
had
been
put
as
to
either
officers
or
men
coming
in
in
any
event
there
was
very
little
to
do
in
the
quaint
dirty
old
spanish
city
though
it
was
interesting
to
go
in
once
or
twice
and
wander
through
the
narrow
streets
with
their
curious
little
shops
and
low
houses
of
stained
stucco
with
elaborately
wrought
iron
trellises
to
the
windows
and
curiously
carved
balconies
or
to
sit
in
the
central
plaza
where
the
cathedral
was
and
the
clubs
and
the
cafe
venus
and
the
low
bare
rambling
building
which
was
called
the
governor
palace
in
this
palace
wood
had
now
been
established
as
military
governor
and
luna
and
two
or
three
of
my
other
officers
from
the
mexican
border
who
knew
spanish
were
sent
in
to
do
duty
under
him
a
great
many
of
my
men
knew
spanish
and
some
of
the
new
mexicans
were
of
spanish
origin
although
they
behaved
precisely
like
the
other
members
of
the
regiment
we
should
probably
have
spent
the
summer
in
our
sick
camps
losing
half
the
men
and
hopelessly
shattering
the
health
of
the
remainder
if
general
shafter
had
not
summoned
a
council
of
officers
hoping
by
united
action
of
a
more
or
less
public
character
to
wake
up
the
washington
authorities
to
the
actual
condition
of
things
as
all
the
spanish
forces
in
the
province
of
santiago
had
surrendered
and
as
immune
regiments
were
coming
to
garrison
the
conquered
territory
there
was
literally
not
one
thing
of
any
kind
whatsoever
for
the
army
to
do
and
no
purpose
to
serve
by
keeping
it
at
santiago
we
did
not
suppose
that
peace
was
at
hand
being
ignorant
of
the
negotiations
we
were
anxious
to
take
part
in
the
porto
rico
campaign
and
would
have
been
more
than
willing
to
suffer
any
amount
of
sickness
if
by
so
doing
we
could
get
into
action
but
if
we
were
not
to
take
part
in
the
porto
rico
campaign
then
we
knew
it
was
absolutely
indispensable
to
get
our
commands
north
immediately
if
they
were
to
be
in
trim
for
the
great
campaign
against
havana
which
would
surely
be
the
main
event
of
the
winter
if
peace
were
not
declared
in
advance
our
army
included
the
great
majority
of
the
regulars
and
was
therefore
the
flower
of
the
american
force
it
was
on
every
account
imperative
to
keep
it
in
good
trim
and
to
keep
it
in
santiago
meant
its
entirely
purposeless
destruction
as
soon
as
the
surrender
was
an
accomplished
fact
the
taking
away
of
the
army
to
the
north
should
have
begun
every
officer
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
especially
among
the
regulars
realized
all
of
this
and
about
the
last
day
of
july
general
shafter
called
a
conference
in
the
palace
of
all
the
division
and
brigade
commanders
by
this
time
owing
to
wood
having
been
made
i
was
in
command
of
my
brigade
so
i
went
to
the
conference
too
riding
in
with
generals
sumner
and
wheeler
who
were
the
other
representatives
of
the
cavalry
division
besides
the
line
officers
all
the
chief
medical
officers
were
present
at
the
conference
the
telegrams
from
the
secretary
stating
the
position
of
himself
and
the
were
read
and
then
almost
every
line
and
medical
officer
present
expressed
his
views
in
turn
they
were
almost
all
regulars
and
had
been
brought
up
to
habits
of
obedience
without
protest
they
were
ready
to
obey
still
but
they
felt
quite
rightly
that
it
was
their
duty
to
protest
rather
than
to
see
the
flower
of
the
united
states
forces
destroyed
as
the
culminating
act
of
a
campaign
in
which
the
blunders
that
had
been
committed
had
been
retrieved
only
by
the
valor
and
splendid
soldierly
qualities
of
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
of
the
infantry
and
dismounted
cavalry
there
was
not
a
dissenting
voice
for
there
could
not
be
there
was
but
one
side
to
the
question
to
talk
of
continually
shifting
camp
or
of
moving
up
the
mountains
or
of
moving
into
the
interior
was
idle
for
not
one
of
the
plans
could
be
carried
out
with
our
utterly
insufficient
transportation
and
at
that
season
and
in
that
climate
they
would
merely
have
resulted
in
aggravating
the
sickliness
of
the
soldiers
it
was
deemed
best
to
make
some
record
of
our
opinion
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
or
report
which
would
show
that
to
keep
the
army
in
santiago
meant
its
absolute
and
objectless
ruin
and
that
it
should
at
once
be
recalled
at
first
there
was
naturally
some
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
regular
officers
to
take
the
initiative
for
their
entire
future
career
might
be
sacrificed
so
i
wrote
a
letter
to
general
shafter
reading
over
the
rough
draft
to
the
various
generals
and
adopting
their
corrections
before
i
had
finished
making
these
corrections
it
was
determined
that
we
should
send
a
circular
letter
on
behalf
of
all
of
us
to
general
shafter
and
when
i
returned
from
presenting
him
mine
i
found
this
circular
letter
already
prepared
and
we
all
of
us
signed
it
both
letters
were
made
public
the
result
was
immediate
within
three
days
the
army
was
ordered
to
be
ready
to
sail
for
home
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
we
were
to
sail
for
home
the
spirits
of
the
men
changed
for
the
better
in
my
regiment
the
officers
began
to
plan
methods
of
drilling
the
men
on
horseback
so
as
to
fit
them
for
use
against
the
spanish
cavalry
if
we
should
go
against
havana
in
december
we
had
all
of
us
eyed
the
captured
spanish
cavalry
with
particular
interest
the
men
were
small
and
the
horses
though
well
trained
and
well
built
were
diminutive
ponies
very
much
smaller
than
cow
ponies
we
were
certain
that
if
we
ever
got
a
chance
to
try
shock
tactics
against
them
they
would
go
down
like
provided
only
that
our
men
could
be
trained
to
charge
in
any
kind
of
line
and
we
made
up
our
minds
to
devote
our
time
to
this
dismounted
work
with
the
rifle
we
already
felt
thoroughly
competent
to
perform
my
time
was
still
much
occupied
with
looking
after
the
health
of
my
brigade
but
the
fact
that
we
were
going
home
where
i
knew
that
their
health
would
improve
lightened
my
mind
and
i
was
able
thoroughly
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
even
of
the
storms
which
hitherto
i
had
regarded
purely
as
enemies
the
surroundings
of
the
city
of
santiago
are
very
grand
the
circling
mountains
rise
sheer
and
high
the
plains
are
threaded
by
rapid
winding
brooks
and
are
dotted
here
and
there
with
quaint
villages
curiously
picturesque
from
their
combining
traces
of
an
outworn
civilization
with
new
and
raw
barbarism
the
tall
graceful
feathery
bamboos
rise
by
the
water
edge
and
elsewhere
even
on
the
where
the
soil
is
wet
and
rank
enough
and
the
splendid
royal
palms
and
cocoanut
palms
tower
high
above
the
matted
green
jungle
generally
the
came
in
the
afternoon
but
once
i
saw
one
at
sunrise
driving
down
the
high
mountain
valleys
toward
us
it
was
a
very
beautiful
and
almost
terrible
sight
for
the
sun
rose
behind
the
storm
and
shone
through
the
gusty
rifts
lighting
the
here
and
there
while
the
plain
below
lay
shrouded
in
the
lingering
night
the
angry
level
rays
edged
the
dark
clouds
with
crimson
and
turned
the
downpour
into
sheets
of
golden
rain
in
the
valleys
the
glimmering
mists
were
tinted
every
wild
hue
and
the
remotest
heavens
were
lit
with
flaming
glory
one
day
general
lawton
general
wood
and
i
with
ferguson
and
poor
tiffany
went
down
the
bay
to
visit
morro
castle
the
shores
were
beautiful
especially
where
there
were
groves
of
palms
and
of
the
tree
and
the
castle
itself
on
a
jutting
headland
overlooking
the
sea
and
guarding
the
deep
narrow
entrance
to
the
bay
showed
just
what
it
was
the
splendid
relic
of
a
vanished
power
and
a
vanished
age
we
wandered
all
through
it
among
the
castellated
battlements
and
in
the
dungeons
where
we
found
hideous
rusty
implements
of
torture
and
looked
at
the
guns
some
modern
and
some
very
old
it
had
been
little
hurt
by
the
bombardment
of
the
ships
afterward
i
had
a
swim
not
trusting
much
to
the
shark
stories
we
passed
by
the
sunken
hulks
of
the
merrimac
and
the
reina
mercedes
lying
just
outside
the
main
channel
our
own
people
had
tried
to
sink
the
first
and
the
spaniards
had
tried
to
sink
the
second
so
as
to
block
the
entrance
neither
attempt
was
successful
on
august
we
were
ordered
to
embark
and
next
morning
we
sailed
on
the
transport
miami
general
wheeler
was
with
us
and
a
squadron
of
the
third
cavalry
under
major
jackson
the
general
put
the
policing
and
management
of
the
ship
into
my
hands
and
i
had
great
aid
from
captain
mccormick
who
had
been
acting
with
me
as
of
the
brigade
i
had
profited
by
my
experience
coming
down
and
as
church
knew
his
work
well
although
he
was
very
sick
we
kept
the
ship
in
such
good
sanitary
condition
that
we
were
one
of
the
very
few
organizations
allowed
to
land
at
montauk
immediately
upon
our
arrival
soon
after
leaving
port
the
captain
of
the
ship
notified
me
that
his
stokers
and
engineers
were
insubordinate
and
drunken
due
he
thought
to
liquor
which
my
men
had
given
them
i
at
once
started
a
search
of
the
ship
explaining
to
the
men
that
they
could
not
keep
the
liquor
that
if
they
surrendered
whatever
they
had
to
me
i
should
return
it
to
them
when
we
went
ashore
and
that
meanwhile
i
would
allow
the
sick
to
drink
when
they
really
needed
it
but
that
if
they
did
not
give
the
liquor
to
me
of
their
own
accord
i
would
throw
it
overboard
about
seventy
flasks
and
bottles
were
handed
to
me
and
i
found
and
threw
overboard
about
twenty
this
at
once
put
a
stop
to
all
drunkenness
the
stokers
and
engineers
were
sullen
and
half
mutinous
so
i
sent
a
detail
of
my
men
down
to
watch
them
and
see
that
they
did
their
work
under
the
orders
of
the
chief
engineer
and
we
reduced
them
to
obedience
in
short
order
i
could
easily
have
drawn
from
the
regiment
sufficient
skilled
men
to
fill
every
position
in
the
entire
crew
from
captain
to
stoker
we
were
very
much
crowded
on
board
the
ship
but
rather
better
off
than
on
the
yucatan
so
far
as
the
men
were
concerned
which
was
the
important
point
all
the
officers
except
general
wheeler
slept
in
a
kind
of
improvised
shed
not
unlike
a
chicken
coop
with
bunks
on
the
aftermost
part
of
the
upper
deck
the
water
was
bad
some
of
it
very
bad
there
was
no
ice
the
canned
beef
proved
practically
uneatable
as
we
knew
would
be
the
case
there
were
not
enough
vegetables
we
did
not
have
enough
disinfectants
and
there
was
no
provision
whatever
for
a
hospital
or
for
isolating
the
sick
we
simply
put
them
on
one
portion
of
one
deck
if
as
so
many
of
the
high
authorities
had
insisted
there
had
really
been
a
epidemic
and
if
it
had
broken
out
on
shipboard
the
condition
would
have
been
frightful
but
there
was
no
epidemic
three
of
our
men
had
been
kept
behind
as
suspects
all
three
suffering
simply
from
malarial
fever
one
of
them
lutz
a
particularly
good
soldier
died
another
who
was
simply
a
malingerer
and
had
nothing
the
matter
with
him
whatever
of
course
recovered
the
third
was
tiffany
who
i
believe
would
have
lived
had
we
been
allowed
to
take
him
with
us
but
who
was
sent
home
later
and
died
soon
after
landing
i
was
very
anxious
to
keep
the
men
amused
and
as
the
quarters
were
so
crowded
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
them
to
have
any
physical
exercise
i
did
not
interfere
with
their
playing
games
of
chance
so
long
as
no
disorder
followed
on
shore
this
was
not
allowed
but
in
the
particular
emergency
which
we
were
meeting
the
loss
of
a
month
salary
was
as
nothing
compared
to
keeping
the
men
thoroughly
interested
and
diverted
by
care
and
diligence
we
succeeded
in
preventing
any
serious
sickness
one
man
died
however
he
had
been
suffering
from
dysentery
ever
since
we
landed
owing
purely
to
his
own
fault
for
on
the
very
first
night
ashore
he
obtained
a
lot
of
fiery
liquor
from
some
of
the
cubans
got
very
drunk
and
had
to
march
next
day
through
the
hot
sun
before
he
was
entirely
sober
he
never
recovered
and
was
useless
from
that
time
on
on
board
ship
he
died
and
we
gave
him
sea
burial
wrapped
in
a
hammock
he
was
placed
opposite
a
port
and
the
american
flag
thrown
over
him
the
engine
was
stilled
and
the
great
ship
rocked
on
the
waves
unshaken
by
the
screw
while
the
troopers
clustered
around
with
bare
heads
to
listen
to
chaplain
brown
read
the
funeral
service
and
to
the
band
of
the
third
cavalry
as
it
played
the
funeral
dirge
then
the
port
was
knocked
free
the
flag
withdrawn
and
the
shotted
hammock
plunged
heavily
over
the
side
rushing
down
through
the
dark
water
to
lie
till
the
judgment
day
in
the
ooze
that
holds
the
timbers
of
so
many
gallant
ships
and
the
bones
of
so
many
fearless
adventurers
we
were
favored
by
good
weather
during
our
nine
days
voyage
and
much
of
the
time
when
there
was
little
to
do
we
simply
sat
together
and
talked
each
man
contributing
from
the
fund
of
his
own
experiences
voyages
around
cape
horn
yacht
races
for
the
cup
experiences
on
teams
which
are
famous
in
the
annals
of
college
sport
more
serious
feats
of
desperate
prowess
in
indian
fighting
and
in
breaking
up
gangs
of
white
outlaws
adventures
in
hunting
big
game
in
breaking
wild
horses
in
tending
great
herds
of
cattle
and
in
wandering
winter
and
summer
among
the
mountains
and
across
the
lonely
plains
the
men
who
told
the
tales
could
draw
upon
countless
memories
such
as
these
of
the
things
they
had
done
and
the
things
they
had
seen
others
do
sometimes
general
wheeler
joined
us
and
told
us
about
the
great
war
compared
with
which
ours
was
such
a
small
war
in
their
importance
though
its
effects
were
destined
to
be
when
we
had
become
convinced
that
we
would
escape
an
epidemic
of
sickness
the
homeward
voyage
became
very
pleasant
on
the
eve
of
leaving
santiago
i
had
received
from
laffan
of
the
sun
a
cable
with
the
single
word
peace
and
we
speculated
much
on
this
as
the
clumsy
transport
steamed
slowly
northward
across
the
trade
wind
and
then
into
the
gulf
stream
at
last
we
sighted
the
low
sandy
bluffs
of
the
long
island
coast
and
late
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
steamed
through
the
still
waters
of
the
sound
and
cast
anchor
off
montauk
a
of
the
mosquito
fleet
came
out
to
greet
us
and
to
inform
us
that
peace
negotiations
had
begun
next
morning
we
were
marched
on
shore
many
of
the
men
were
very
sick
indeed
of
the
three
or
four
who
had
been
closest
to
me
among
the
enlisted
men
wright
was
the
only
one
in
good
health
henry
bardshar
was
a
wreck
literally
at
death
door
i
was
myself
in
health
all
the
better
for
having
lost
twenty
pounds
faithful
marshall
my
colored
was
so
sick
as
to
be
nearly
helpless
bob
wrenn
nearly
died
he
had
joined
us
very
late
and
we
could
not
get
him
a
krag
carbine
so
i
had
given
him
my
winchester
which
carried
the
government
cartridge
and
when
he
was
mustered
out
he
carried
it
home
in
triumph
to
the
envy
of
his
fellows
who
themselves
had
to
surrender
their
beloved
rifles
for
the
first
few
days
there
was
great
confusion
and
some
want
even
after
we
got
to
montauk
the
men
in
hospitals
suffered
from
lack
of
almost
everything
even
cots
but
after
these
few
days
we
were
very
well
cared
for
and
had
abundance
of
all
we
needed
except
that
on
several
occasions
there
was
a
shortage
of
food
for
the
horses
which
i
should
have
regarded
as
even
more
serious
than
a
shortage
for
the
men
had
it
not
been
that
we
were
about
to
be
disbanded
the
men
lived
high
with
milk
eggs
oranges
and
any
amount
of
tobacco
the
lack
of
which
during
portions
of
the
cuban
campaign
had
been
felt
as
seriously
as
any
lack
of
food
one
of
the
distressing
features
of
the
malarial
fever
which
had
been
ravaging
the
troops
was
that
it
was
recurrent
and
persistent
some
of
my
men
died
after
reaching
home
and
many
were
very
sick
we
owed
much
to
the
kindness
not
only
of
the
new
york
hospitals
and
the
red
cross
and
kindred
societies
but
of
individuals
notably
bayard
cutting
and
armitage
who
took
many
of
our
men
to
their
beautiful
long
island
homes
on
the
whole
however
the
month
we
spent
at
montauk
before
we
disbanded
was
very
pleasant
it
was
good
to
meet
the
rest
of
the
regiment
they
all
felt
dreadfully
at
not
having
been
in
cuba
it
was
a
sore
trial
to
men
who
had
given
up
much
to
go
to
the
war
and
who
rebelled
at
nothing
in
the
way
of
hardship
or
suffering
but
who
did
bitterly
feel
the
fact
that
their
sacrifices
seemed
to
have
been
useless
of
course
those
who
stayed
had
done
their
duty
precisely
as
did
those
who
went
for
the
question
of
glory
was
not
to
be
considered
in
comparison
to
the
faithful
performance
of
whatever
was
ordered
and
no
distinction
of
any
kind
was
allowed
in
the
regiment
between
those
whose
good
fortune
it
had
been
to
go
and
those
whose
harder
fate
it
had
been
to
remain
nevertheless
the
latter
could
not
be
entirely
comforted
the
regiment
had
three
mascots
the
two
most
characteristic
a
young
mountain
lion
brought
by
the
arizona
troops
and
a
war
eagle
brought
by
the
new
mexicans
we
had
been
forced
to
leave
behind
in
tampa
the
third
a
rather
disreputable
but
exceedingly
knowing
little
dog
named
cuba
had
accompanied
us
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
the
campaign
the
mountain
lion
josephine
possessed
an
infernal
temper
whereas
both
cuba
and
the
eagle
which
have
been
named
in
my
honor
were
extremely
josephine
was
kept
tied
up
she
sometimes
escaped
one
cool
night
in
early
september
she
wandered
off
and
entering
the
tent
of
a
third
cavalry
man
got
into
bed
with
him
whereupon
he
fled
into
the
darkness
with
yells
much
more
unnerved
than
he
would
have
been
by
the
arrival
of
any
number
of
spaniards
the
eagle
was
let
loose
and
not
only
walked
at
will
up
and
down
the
company
streets
but
also
at
times
flew
wherever
he
wished
he
was
a
young
bird
having
been
taken
out
of
his
nest
when
a
fledgling
josephine
hated
him
and
was
always
trying
to
make
a
meal
of
him
especially
when
we
endeavored
to
take
their
photographs
together
the
eagle
though
was
an
entirely
competent
individual
and
ready
at
any
moment
to
beat
josephine
off
cuba
was
also
oppressed
at
times
by
josephine
and
was
of
course
no
match
for
her
but
was
frequently
able
to
overawe
by
simple
decision
of
character
in
addition
to
the
animal
mascots
we
had
two
or
three
small
boys
who
had
also
been
adopted
by
the
regiment
one
from
tennessee
was
named
dabney
royster
when
we
embarked
at
tampa
he
smuggled
himself
on
board
the
transport
with
a
rifle
and
three
boxes
of
cartridges
and
wept
bitterly
when
sent
ashore
the
squadron
which
remained
behind
adopted
him
got
him
a
little
rough
rider
uniform
and
made
him
practically
one
of
the
regiment
the
men
who
had
remained
at
tampa
like
ourselves
had
suffered
much
from
fever
and
the
horses
were
in
bad
shape
so
many
of
the
men
were
sick
that
none
of
the
regiments
began
to
drill
for
some
time
after
reaching
montauk
there
was
a
great
deal
of
to
be
done
but
as
i
still
had
charge
of
the
brigade
only
a
little
of
it
fell
on
my
shoulders
of
this
i
was
sincerely
glad
for
i
knew
as
little
of
the
as
my
men
had
originally
known
of
drill
we
had
all
of
us
learned
how
to
fight
and
march
but
the
exact
limits
of
our
rights
and
duties
in
other
respects
were
not
very
clearly
defined
in
our
minds
and
as
for
myself
as
i
had
not
had
the
time
to
learn
exactly
what
they
were
i
had
assumed
a
large
authority
in
giving
rewards
and
punishments
in
particular
i
had
looked
on
much
as
peter
bell
looked
on
primroses
they
were
and
nothing
more
whether
resting
on
the
authority
of
a
or
of
a
the
officer
a
thorough
soldier
found
to
his
horror
that
i
had
used
the
widest
discretion
both
in
imposing
heavy
sentences
which
i
had
no
power
to
impose
on
men
who
shirked
their
duties
and
where
men
atoned
for
misconduct
by
marked
gallantry
in
blandly
remitting
sentences
approved
by
my
chief
of
division
however
i
had
done
substantial
even
though
somewhat
rude
and
irregular
justice
and
no
harm
could
result
as
we
were
just
about
to
be
mustered
out
my
chief
duties
were
to
see
that
the
camps
of
the
three
regiments
were
thoroughly
policed
and
kept
in
sanitary
condition
this
took
up
some
time
of
course
and
there
were
other
matters
in
connection
with
the
mustering
out
which
had
to
be
attended
to
but
i
could
always
get
two
or
three
hours
a
day
free
from
work
then
i
would
summon
a
number
of
the
officers
kane
greenway
goodrich
church
ferguson
mcilhenny
frantz
ballard
and
others
and
we
would
gallop
down
to
the
beach
and
bathe
in
the
surf
or
else
go
for
long
rides
over
the
beautiful
rolling
plains
thickly
studded
with
pools
which
were
white
with
sometimes
i
went
off
alone
with
my
orderly
young
gordon
johnston
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
regiment
he
was
a
nephew
of
the
governor
of
alabama
and
when
at
princeton
had
played
on
the
eleven
we
had
plenty
of
horses
and
these
rides
were
most
enjoyable
galloping
over
the
open
rolling
country
through
the
cool
fall
evenings
made
us
feel
as
if
we
were
out
on
the
great
western
plains
and
might
at
any
moment
start
deer
from
the
brush
or
see
antelope
stand
and
gaze
far
away
or
rouse
a
band
of
mighty
elk
and
hear
their
horns
clatter
as
they
fled
an
old
friend
baron
von
sternberg
of
the
german
embassy
spent
a
week
in
camp
with
me
he
had
served
when
only
seventeen
in
the
war
as
a
hussar
and
was
a
noted
being
the
little
baron
who
is
the
hero
of
archibald
forbes
true
story
of
the
he
and
i
had
for
years
talked
over
the
possibilities
of
just
such
a
regiment
as
the
one
i
was
commanding
and
he
was
greatly
interested
in
it
indeed
i
had
vainly
sought
permission
from
the
german
ambassador
to
take
him
with
the
regiment
to
santiago
one
sunday
before
the
regiment
disbanded
i
supplemented
chaplain
brown
address
to
the
men
by
a
short
sermon
of
a
rather
hortatory
character
i
told
them
how
proud
i
was
of
them
but
warned
them
not
to
think
that
they
could
now
go
back
and
rest
on
their
laurels
bidding
them
remember
that
though
for
ten
days
or
so
the
world
would
be
willing
to
treat
them
as
heroes
yet
after
that
time
they
would
find
they
had
to
get
down
to
hard
work
just
like
everyone
else
unless
they
were
willing
to
be
regarded
as
worthless
they
took
the
sermon
in
good
part
and
i
hope
that
some
of
them
profited
by
it
at
any
rate
they
repaid
me
by
a
very
much
more
tangible
expression
of
affection
one
afternoon
to
my
genuine
surprise
i
was
asked
out
of
my
tent
by
brodie
the
gallant
old
boy
had
rejoined
us
and
found
the
whole
regiment
formed
in
hollow
square
with
the
officers
and
in
the
middle
when
i
went
in
one
of
the
troopers
came
forward
and
on
behalf
of
the
regiment
presented
me
with
remington
fine
bronze
the
there
could
have
been
no
more
appropriate
gift
from
such
a
regiment
and
i
was
not
only
pleased
with
it
but
very
deeply
touched
with
the
feeling
which
made
them
join
in
giving
it
afterward
they
all
filed
past
and
i
shook
the
hands
of
each
to
say
most
of
them
looked
upon
the
bronze
with
the
critical
eyes
of
professionals
i
doubt
if
there
was
any
regiment
in
the
world
which
contained
so
large
a
number
of
men
able
to
ride
the
wildest
and
most
dangerous
horses
one
day
while
at
montauk
point
some
of
the
troopers
of
the
third
cavalry
were
getting
ready
for
mounted
drill
when
one
of
their
horses
escaped
having
thrown
his
rider
this
attracted
the
attention
of
some
of
our
men
and
they
strolled
around
to
see
the
trooper
remount
he
was
instantly
thrown
again
the
horse
a
huge
vicious
sorrel
being
one
of
the
worst
buckers
i
ever
saw
and
none
of
his
comrades
were
willing
to
ride
the
animal
our
men
of
course
jeered
and
mocked
at
them
and
in
response
were
dared
to
ride
the
horse
themselves
the
challenge
was
instantly
accepted
the
only
question
being
as
to
which
of
a
dozen
noted
who
were
in
the
ranks
should
undertake
the
task
they
finally
settled
on
a
man
named
darnell
it
was
agreed
that
the
experiment
should
take
place
next
day
when
the
horse
would
be
fresh
and
accordingly
next
day
the
majority
of
both
regiments
turned
out
on
a
big
open
flat
in
front
of
my
tent
brigade
the
result
was
that
after
as
fine
a
bit
of
rough
riding
as
one
would
care
to
see
in
which
one
scarcely
knew
whether
most
to
wonder
at
the
extraordinary
viciousness
and
agile
strength
of
the
horse
or
at
the
horsemanship
and
courage
of
the
rider
darnell
came
off
victorious
his
seat
never
having
been
shaken
after
this
almost
every
day
we
had
exhibitions
of
in
which
all
the
crack
riders
of
the
regiment
vied
with
one
another
riding
not
only
all
of
our
own
bad
horses
but
any
horse
which
was
deemed
bad
in
any
of
the
other
regiments
darnell
mcginty
wood
smoky
moore
and
a
score
of
others
took
part
in
these
exhibitions
which
included
not
merely
feats
in
mastering
vicious
horses
but
also
feats
of
broken
horses
which
the
riders
had
trained
to
lie
down
at
command
and
upon
which
they
could
mount
while
at
full
speed
toward
the
end
of
the
time
we
also
had
mounted
drill
on
two
or
three
occasions
and
when
the
president
visited
the
camp
we
turned
out
mounted
to
receive
him
as
did
the
rest
of
the
cavalry
the
last
night
before
we
were
mustered
out
was
spent
in
noisy
but
entirely
harmless
hilarity
which
i
ignored
every
form
of
celebration
took
place
in
the
ranks
a
former
populist
candidate
for
in
colorado
delivered
a
fervent
oration
in
favor
of
free
silver
a
number
of
the
college
boys
sang
but
most
of
the
men
gave
vent
to
their
feelings
by
improvised
dances
in
these
the
indians
took
the
lead
pure
bloods
and
alike
the
cowboys
and
miners
cheerfully
joining
in
and
forming
part
of
the
howling
grunting
rings
that
went
bounding
around
the
great
fires
they
had
kindled
next
morning
sergeant
wright
took
down
the
colors
and
sergeant
guitilias
the
standard
for
the
last
time
the
horses
the
rifles
and
the
rest
of
the
regimental
property
had
been
turned
in
officers
and
men
shook
hands
and
said
to
one
another
and
then
they
scattered
to
their
homes
in
the
north
and
the
south
the
few
going
back
to
the
great
cities
of
the
east
the
many
turning
again
toward
the
plains
the
mountains
and
the
deserts
of
the
west
and
the
strange
southwest
this
was
on
september
the
day
which
marked
the
close
of
the
four
months
life
of
a
regiment
of
as
gallant
fighters
as
ever
wore
the
united
states
uniform
the
regiment
was
a
wholly
exceptional
volunteer
organization
and
its
career
can
not
be
taken
as
in
any
way
a
justification
for
the
belief
that
the
average
volunteer
regiment
approaches
the
average
regular
regiment
in
point
of
efficiency
until
it
has
had
many
months
of
active
service
in
the
first
place
though
the
regular
regiments
may
differ
markedly
among
themselves
yet
the
range
of
variation
among
them
is
nothing
like
so
wide
as
that
among
volunteer
regiments
where
at
first
there
is
no
common
standard
at
all
the
very
best
being
perhaps
up
to
the
level
of
the
regulars
as
has
recently
been
shown
at
manila
while
the
very
worst
are
no
better
than
mobs
and
the
great
bulk
come
in
between
the
average
regular
regiment
is
superior
to
the
average
volunteer
regiment
in
the
physique
of
the
enlisted
men
who
have
been
very
carefully
selected
who
have
been
trained
to
life
in
the
open
and
who
know
how
to
cook
and
take
care
of
themselves
generally
note
for
sound
about
the
volunteers
see
excellent
little
book
the
gatlings
at
santiago
now
in
all
these
respects
and
in
others
like
them
the
rough
riders
were
the
equals
of
the
regulars
they
were
hardy
accustomed
to
shift
for
themselves
in
the
open
under
very
adverse
circumstances
the
two
qualifications
for
a
cavalryman
are
riding
and
shooting
the
modern
cavalryman
being
so
often
used
dismounted
as
an
infantryman
the
average
recruit
requires
a
couple
of
years
before
he
becomes
proficient
in
horsemanship
and
marksmanship
but
my
men
were
already
good
shots
and
riders
when
they
came
into
the
regiment
the
difference
as
regards
officers
and
officers
between
regulars
and
volunteers
is
usually
very
great
but
in
my
regiment
keeping
in
view
the
material
we
had
to
handle
it
was
easy
to
develop
officers
out
of
men
who
had
been
foremen
ranch
foremen
mining
bosses
and
the
like
these
men
were
intelligent
and
resolute
they
knew
they
had
a
great
deal
to
learn
and
they
set
to
work
to
learn
it
while
they
were
already
accustomed
to
managing
considerable
interests
to
obeying
orders
and
to
taking
care
of
others
as
well
as
themselves
as
for
the
officers
the
great
point
in
our
favor
was
the
anxiety
they
showed
to
learn
from
those
among
their
number
who
like
capron
had
already
served
in
the
regular
army
and
the
fact
that
we
had
chosen
a
regular
army
man
as
colonel
if
a
volunteer
organization
consists
of
good
material
and
is
eager
to
learn
it
can
readily
do
so
if
it
has
one
or
two
regular
officers
to
teach
it
moreover
most
of
our
captains
and
lieutenants
were
men
who
had
seen
much
of
wild
life
who
were
accustomed
to
handling
and
commanding
other
men
and
who
had
usually
already
been
under
fire
as
sheriffs
marshals
and
the
like
as
for
the
second
in
command
myself
i
had
served
three
years
as
captain
in
the
national
guard
i
had
been
deputy
sheriff
in
the
cow
country
where
the
position
was
not
a
sinecure
i
was
accustomed
to
big
game
hunting
and
to
work
on
a
cow
ranch
so
that
i
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
use
both
of
horse
and
rifle
and
knew
how
to
handle
cowboys
hunters
and
miners
finally
i
had
studied
much
in
the
literature
of
war
and
especially
the
literature
of
the
great
modern
wars
like
our
own
civil
war
the
war
the
war
and
i
was
especially
familiar
with
the
deeds
the
successes
and
failures
alike
of
the
frontier
horse
riflemen
who
had
fought
at
king
mountain
and
the
thames
and
on
the
mexican
border
finally
and
most
important
of
all
officers
and
men
alike
were
eager
for
fighting
and
resolute
to
do
well
and
behave
properly
to
encounter
hardship
and
privation
and
the
irksome
monotony
of
camp
routine
without
grumbling
or
complaining
they
had
counted
the
cost
before
they
went
in
and
were
delighted
to
pay
the
penalties
inevitably
attendant
upon
the
career
of
a
fighting
regiment
and
from
the
moment
when
the
regiment
began
to
gather
the
higher
officers
kept
instilling
into
those
under
them
the
spirit
of
eagerness
for
action
and
of
stern
determination
to
grasp
at
death
rather
than
forfeit
honor
the
spirit
of
the
men
was
well
shown
after
they
left
the
regiment
of
course
there
were
a
few
weaklings
among
them
and
there
were
others
entirely
brave
and
normally
who
from
wounds
or
fevers
were
so
reduced
that
they
had
to
apply
for
aid
or
at
least
who
deserved
aid
even
though
they
often
could
only
be
persuaded
with
the
greatest
difficulty
to
accept
it
the
widows
and
orphans
had
to
be
taken
care
of
there
were
a
few
individuals
who
were
entirely
ready
to
fight
in
time
of
war
but
in
time
of
peace
felt
that
somebody
ought
to
take
care
of
them
and
there
were
others
who
never
having
seen
any
aggregation
of
buildings
larger
than
an
ordinary
fell
a
victim
to
the
fascinations
of
new
york
but
as
a
whole
they
scattered
out
to
their
homes
on
the
disbandment
of
the
regiment
gaunter
than
when
they
had
enlisted
sometimes
weakened
by
fever
or
wounds
but
just
as
full
as
ever
of
sullen
sturdy
capacity
for
scorning
to
ask
for
aid
save
what
was
entirely
legitimate
in
the
way
of
one
comrade
giving
help
to
another
a
number
of
the
examining
surgeons
at
the
spoke
to
me
with
admiration
of
the
contrast
offered
by
our
regiment
to
so
many
others
in
the
fact
that
our
men
always
belittled
their
own
bodily
injuries
and
sufferings
so
that
whereas
the
surgeons
ordinarily
had
to
be
on
the
lest
a
man
who
was
not
really
disabled
should
claim
to
be
so
in
our
case
they
had
to
adopt
exactly
the
opposite
attitude
and
guard
the
future
interests
of
the
men
by
insisting
upon
putting
upon
their
certificates
of
discharge
whatever
disease
they
had
contracted
or
wound
they
had
received
in
line
of
duty
major
calef
who
had
more
than
any
other
one
man
to
do
with
seeing
to
the
proper
discharge
papers
of
our
men
and
who
took
a
most
generous
interest
in
them
wrote
me
as
follows
i
also
wish
to
bring
to
your
notice
the
fortitude
displayed
by
the
men
of
your
regiment
who
have
come
before
me
to
be
mustered
out
of
service
in
making
their
personal
declarations
as
to
their
physical
conditions
men
who
bore
on
their
faces
and
in
their
forms
the
traces
of
long
days
of
illness
indicating
wrecked
constitutions
declared
that
nothing
was
the
matter
with
them
at
the
same
time
disclaiming
any
intention
of
applying
for
a
pension
it
was
exceptionally
heroic
when
we
were
mustered
out
many
of
the
men
had
lost
their
jobs
and
were
too
weak
to
go
to
work
at
once
while
there
were
helpless
dependents
of
the
dead
to
care
for
certain
of
my
friends
august
belmont
stanley
and
richard
mortimer
major
austin
wadsworth
himself
fresh
from
the
manila
campaign
belmont
tiffany
and
others
gave
me
sums
of
money
to
be
used
for
helping
these
men
in
some
instances
by
the
exercise
of
a
good
deal
of
tact
and
by
treating
the
gift
as
a
memorial
of
poor
young
lieutenant
tiffany
we
got
the
men
to
accept
something
and
of
course
there
were
a
number
who
quite
rightly
made
no
difficulty
about
accepting
but
most
of
the
men
would
accept
no
help
whatever
in
the
first
chapter
i
spoke
of
a
lady
a
teacher
in
an
academy
in
the
indian
territory
three
or
four
of
whose
pupils
had
come
into
my
regiment
and
who
had
sent
with
them
a
letter
of
introduction
to
me
when
the
regiment
disbanded
i
wrote
to
her
to
ask
if
she
could
not
use
a
little
money
among
the
rough
riders
white
indian
and
that
she
might
personally
know
i
did
not
hear
from
her
for
some
time
and
then
she
wrote
as
follows
muscogee
ind
december
my
dear
colonel
roosevelt
i
did
not
at
once
reply
to
your
letter
of
september
because
i
waited
for
a
time
to
see
if
there
should
be
need
among
any
of
our
rough
riders
of
the
money
you
so
kindly
offered
some
of
the
boys
are
poor
and
in
one
or
two
cases
they
seemed
to
me
really
needy
but
they
all
said
no
more
than
once
i
saw
the
tears
come
to
their
eyes
at
thought
of
your
care
for
them
as
i
told
them
of
your
letter
did
you
hear
any
echoes
of
our
indian
over
your
election
they
were
pretty
loud
i
was
particularly
exultant
because
my
father
was
a
new
yorker
and
i
was
educated
in
new
york
even
if
i
was
born
here
so
far
as
i
can
learn
the
boys
are
taking
up
the
dropped
threads
of
their
lives
as
though
they
had
never
been
away
our
two
rough
rider
students
meagher
and
gilmore
are
doing
well
in
their
college
work
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
of
the
death
of
one
of
your
most
devoted
troopers
bert
holderman
who
was
here
serving
on
the
grand
jury
he
was
stricken
with
meningitis
in
the
and
died
after
three
days
of
delirium
his
father
who
was
twice
wounded
four
times
taken
prisoner
and
fought
in
battles
of
the
civil
war
now
old
and
feeble
survives
him
and
it
was
indeed
pathetic
to
see
his
grief
bert
mother
who
is
a
cherokee
was
raised
in
my
grandfather
family
the
words
of
commendation
which
you
wrote
upon
bert
discharge
are
the
greatest
comfort
to
his
friends
they
wanted
you
to
know
of
his
death
because
he
loved
you
so
i
am
planning
to
entertain
all
the
rough
riders
in
this
vicinity
some
evening
during
my
holiday
vacation
i
mean
to
have
no
other
guests
but
only
give
them
an
opportunity
for
reminiscences
i
regret
that
bert
death
makes
one
less
i
had
hoped
to
have
them
sooner
but
our
struggling
young
college
salaries
are
necessarily
small
and
duties
arduous
i
make
a
home
for
my
widowed
mother
and
an
adopted
indian
daughter
who
is
in
school
and
as
i
do
the
cooking
for
a
family
of
five
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
do
many
things
i
would
like
to
pardon
me
for
burdening
you
with
these
details
but
i
suppose
i
am
like
your
boys
who
say
colonel
was
always
as
ready
to
listen
to
a
private
as
to
a
wishing
you
and
yours
the
very
best
gifts
the
season
can
bring
i
am
very
truly
yours
alice
m
robertson
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
loved
my
regiment
appendix
a
roll
owing
to
the
circumstances
of
the
regiment
service
the
paperwork
was
very
difficult
to
perform
this
roll
is
very
defective
in
certain
points
notably
in
the
enumeration
of
the
wounded
who
had
been
able
to
return
to
duty
some
of
the
dead
are
also
undoubtedly
passed
over
thus
i
have
put
in
race
smith
sanders
and
tiffany
as
dead
correcting
the
rolls
but
there
are
doubtless
a
number
of
similar
corrections
which
should
be
made
but
have
not
been
as
the
regiment
is
now
scattered
far
and
wide
i
have
also
corrected
the
record
for
the
wounded
men
in
one
or
two
places
where
i
happen
to
remember
it
but
there
are
a
number
of
the
wounded
especially
the
slightly
wounded

are

of

died
from

soon
after

containing
a
request
for
information
by
the
of
september
i
have
the
honor
to
report
as
follows
i
am
a
little
in
doubt
whether
the
fact
that
on
certain
occasions
my
regiment
suffered
for
food
should
be
put
down
to
an
actual
shortage
of
supplies
or
to
general
defects
in
the
system
of
administration
thus
when
the
regiment
arrived
in
tampa
after
a
four
days
journey
by
cars
from
its
camp
at
san
antonio
it
received
no
food
whatever
for
hours
and
as
the
travel
rations
had
been
completely
exhausted
food
for
several
of
the
troops
was
purchased
by
their
officers
who
of
course
have
not
been
reimbursed
by
the
government
in
the
same
way
we
were
short
one
or
two
meals
at
the
time
of
embarking
at
port
tampa
on
the
transport
but
this
i
think
was
due
not
to
a
failure
in
the
quantity
of
supplies
but
to
the
lack
of
system
in
embarkation
as
with
the
other
regiments
no
information
was
given
in
advance
what
transports
we
should
take
or
how
we
should
proceed
to
get
aboard
nor
did
anyone
exercise
any
supervision
over
the
embarkation
each
regimental
commander
so
far
as
i
know
was
left
to
find
out
as
best
he
could
after
he
was
down
at
the
dock
what
transport
had
not
been
taken
and
then
to
get
his
regiment
aboard
it
if
he
was
able
before
some
other
regiment
got
it
our
regiment
was
told
to
go
to
a
certain
switch
and
take
a
train
for
port
tampa
at
twelve
midnight
the
train
never
came
after
three
hours
of
waiting
we
were
sent
to
another
switch
and
finally
at
six
in
the
morning
got
possession
of
some
and
came
down
in
them
when
we
reached
the
quay
where
the
embarkation
was
proceeding
everything
was
in
utter
confusion
the
quay
was
piled
with
stores
and
swarming
with
thousands
of
men
of
different
regiments
besides
onlookers
etc
the
commanding
general
when
we
at
last
found
him
told
colonel
wood
and
myself
that
he
did
not
know
what
ship
we
were
to
embark
on
and
that
we
must
find
colonel
humphrey
the
colonel
humphrey
was
not
in
his
office
and
nobody
knew
where
he
was
the
commanders
of
the
different
regiments
were
busy
trying
to
find
him
while
their
troops
waited
in
the
trains
so
as
to
discover
the
ships
to
which
they
were
allotted
some
of
these
ships
being
at
the
dock
and
some
in
after
a
couple
of
hours
search
colonel
wood
found
colonel
humphrey
and
was
allotted
a
ship
immediately
afterward
i
found
that
it
had
already
been
allotted
to
two
other
regiments
it
was
then
coming
to
the
dock
colonel
wood
boarded
it
in
to
keep
possession
while
i
the
men
down
from
the
cars
and
got
there
just
ahead
of
the
other
two
regiments
one
of
these
regiments
i
was
afterward
informed
spent
the
next
hours
in
cars
in
consequence
we
suffered
nothing
beyond
the
loss
of
a
couple
of
meals
which
it
seems
to
me
can
hardly
be
put
down
to
any
failure
in
the
quantity
of
supplies
furnished
to
the
troops
we
were
two
weeks
on
the
yucatan
and
as
we
were
given
twelve
days
travel
rations
we
of
course
fell
short
toward
the
end
of
the
trip
but
eked
things
out
with
some
of
our
field
rations
and
troop
stuff
the
quality
of
the
travel
rations
given
to
us
was
good
except
in
the
important
item
of
meat
the
canned
roast
beef
is
worse
than
a
failure
as
part
of
the
rations
for
in
effect
it
amounts
to
reducing
the
rations
by
just
so
much
as
a
great
majority
of
the
men
find
it
uneatable
it
was
coarse
stringy
tasteless
and
very
disagreeable
in
appearance
and
so
unpalatable
that
the
effort
to
eat
it
made
some
of
the
men
sick
most
of
the
men
preferred
to
be
hungry
rather
than
eat
it
if
cooked
in
a
stew
with
plenty
of
onions
and
potatoes
if
only
one
ingredient
in
a
dish
with
other
more
savory
ingredients
it
could
be
eaten
especially
if
well
salted
and
peppered
but
as
usual
what
i
regard
as
a
great
mistake
no
salt
was
issued
with
the
travel
rations
and
of
course
no
potatoes
and
onions
there
were
no
cooking
facilities
on
the
transport
when
the
men
obtained
any
it
was
by
bribing
the
cook
toward
the
last
when
they
began
to
draw
on
the
field
rations
they
had
to
eat
the
bacon
raw
on
the
return
trip
the
same
difficulty
in
rations
the
rations
were
short
because
the
men
could
not
eat
the
canned
roast
beef
and
had
no
salt
we
purchased
of
the
ship
supplies
some
flour
and
pork
and
a
little
rice
for
the
men
so
as
to
relieve
the
shortage
as
much
as
possible
and
individual
sick
men
were
helped
from
private
sources
by
officers
who
themselves
ate
what
they
had
purchased
in
santiago
as
of
the
men
were
more
or
less
sick
the
unattractiveness
of
the
travel
rations
was
doubly
unfortunate
it
would
have
been
an
excellent
thing
for
their
health
if
we
could
have
had
onions
and
potatoes
and
means
for
cooking
them
moreover
the
water
was
very
bad
and
sometimes
a
cask
was
struck
that
was
positively
undrinkable
the
lack
of
ice
for
the
weak
and
sickly
men
was
very
much
felt
fortunately
there
was
no
epidemic
for
there
was
not
a
place
on
the
ship
where
patients
could
have
been
isolated
during
the
month
following
the
landing
of
the
army
in
cuba
the
were
generally
short
in
quantity
and
in
quality
were
never
such
as
were
best
suited
to
men
undergoing
severe
hardships
and
great
exposure
in
an
unhealthy
tropical
climate
the
rations
were
i
understand
the
same
as
those
used
in
the
klondike
in
this
connection
i
call
especial
attention
to
the
report
of
captain
brown
made
by
my
orders
when
i
was
and
herewith
appended
i
also
call
attention
to
the
report
of
my
own
quartermaster
usually
we
received
full
rations
of
bacon
and
hardtack
the
hardtack
however
was
often
mouldy
so
that
parts
of
cases
and
even
whole
cases
could
not
be
used
the
bacon
was
usually
good
but
bacon
and
hardtack
make
poor
food
for
men
toiling
and
fighting
in
trenches
under
the
midsummer
sun
of
the
tropics
the
ration
of
coffee
was
often
short
and
that
of
sugar
generally
so
we
rarely
got
any
vegetables
under
these
circumstances
the
men
lost
strength
steadily
and
as
the
fever
speedily
attacked
them
they
suffered
from
being
reduced
to
a
bacon
and
hardtack
diet
so
much
did
the
shortage
of
proper
food
tell
upon
their
health
that
again
and
again
officers
were
compelled
to
draw
upon
their
private
purses
or
upon
the
red
cross
society
to
make
good
the
deficiency
of
the
government
supply
again
and
again
we
sent
down
improvised
composed
of
officers
horses
of
captured
spanish
cavalry
ponies
or
of
mules
which
had
been
shot
or
abandoned
but
were
cured
by
our
men
these
expeditions
sometimes
under
the
chaplain
sometimes
under
the
quartermaster
sometimes
under
myself
and
occasionally
under
a
trooper
would
go
to
the
or
to
the
red
cross
or
after
the
surrender
into
the
city
of
santiago
to
get
food
both
for
the
well
and
the
sick
the
red
cross
society
rendered
invaluable
aid
for
example
on
one
of
these
expeditions
i
personally
brought
up
pounds
of
beans
on
another
occasion
i
personally
brought
up
pounds
of
rice
pounds
of
cornmeal
pounds
of
sugar
pounds
of
tea
pounds
of
oatmeal
barrels
of
potatoes
and
two
of
onions
with
cases
of
canned
soup
and
condensed
milk
for
the
sick
in
hospitals
every
scrap
of
the
food
thus
brought
up
was
eaten
with
avidity
by
the
soldiers
and
put
new
heart
and
strength
into
them
it
was
only
our
constant
care
of
the
men
in
this
way
that
enabled
us
to
keep
them
in
any
trim
at
all
as
for
the
sick
in
the
hospital
unless
we
were
able
from
outside
sources
to
get
them
such
simple
delicacies
as
rice
and
condensed
milk
they
usually
had
the
alternative
of
eating
salt
pork
and
hardtack
or
going
without
after
each
fight
we
got
a
good
deal
of
food
from
the
spanish
camps
in
the
way
of
beans
peas
and
rice
together
with
green
coffee
all
of
which
the
men
used
and
relished
greatly
in
some
respects
the
spanish
rations
were
preferable
to
ours
notably
in
the
use
of
rice
after
we
had
been
ashore
a
month
the
supplies
began
to
come
in
in
abundance
and
we
then
fared
very
well
up
to
that
time
the
men
were
during
the
very
weeks
when
the
heaviest
drain
was
being
made
upon
their
vitality
and
the
deficiency
was
only
partially
supplied
through
the
aid
of
the
red
cross
and
out
of
the
officers
pockets
and
the
pockets
of
various
new
york
friends
who
sent
us
money
before
during
and
immediately
after
the
fights
of
june
and
july
we
were
very
short
of
even
the
bacon
and
hardtack
about
july
when
the
heavy
rains
interrupted
communication
we
were
threatened
with
famine
as
we
were
informed
that
there
was
not
a
day
supply
of
provisions
in
advance
nearer
than
the
and
another
hours
rain
would
have
resulted
in
a
complete
of
communications
so
that
for
several
days
we
should
have
been
reduced
to
a
diet
of
and
mangos
at
this
time
in
anticipation
of
such
a
contingency
by
foraging
and
hoarding
we
got
a
little
ahead
so
that
when
our
supplies
were
cut
down
for
a
day
or
two
we
did
not
suffer
much
and
were
even
able
to
furnish
a
little
aid
to
the
less
fortunate
first
illinois
regiment
which
was
camped
next
to
us
members
of
the
illinois
regiment
were
offering
our
men
apiece
for
hardtacks
i
wish
to
bear
testimony
to
the
energy
and
capacity
of
colonel
weston
the
with
the
expedition
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
active
aid
we
should
have
fared
worse
than
we
did
all
that
he
could
do
for
us
he
most
cheerfully
did
as
regards
the
clothing
i
have
to
say
as
to
the
first
issue
the
blue
shirts
were
excellent
of
their
kind
but
altogether
too
hot
for
cuba
they
are
just
what
i
used
to
wear
in
montana
the
leggings
were
good
the
shoes
were
very
good
the
undershirts
not
very
good
and
the
drawers
bad
being
of
heavy
thick
canton
flannel
difficult
to
wash
and
entirely
unfit
for
a
tropical
climate
the
trousers
were
poor
wearing
badly
we
did
not
get
any
other
clothing
until
we
were
just
about
to
leave
cuba
by
which
time
most
of
the
men
were
in
tatters
some
being
actually
barefooted
while
others
were
in
rags
or
dressed
partly
in
clothes
captured
from
the
spaniards
who
were
much
more
suitably
clothed
for
the
climate
and
place
than
we
were
the
ponchos
were
poor
being
inferior
to
the
spanish
which
we
captured
as
to
the
medical
matters
i
invite
your
attention
not
only
to
the
report
of
church
accompanying
this
letter
but
to
the
letters
of
captain
llewellen
captain
day
and
lieutenant
mcilhenny
i
could
readily
produce
a
hundred
letters
on
the
lines
of
the
last
three
in
actual
medical
supplies
we
had
plenty
of
quinine
and
cathartics
we
were
apt
to
be
short
on
other
medicines
and
we
had
nothing
whatever
in
the
way
of
proper
nourishing
food
for
our
sick
and
wounded
men
during
most
of
the
time
except
what
we
were
able
to
get
from
the
red
cross
or
purchase
with
our
own
money
we
had
no
hospital
tent
at
all
until
i
was
able
to
get
a
couple
of
tarpaulins
during
much
of
the
time
my
own
fly
was
used
for
the
purpose
we
had
no
cots
until
by
individual
effort
we
obtained
a
few
only
three
or
four
days
before
we
left
cuba
during
most
of
the
time
the
sick
men
lay
on
the
muddy
ground
in
blankets
if
they
had
any
if
not
they
lay
without
them
until
some
of
the
well
men
cut
their
own
blankets
in
half
our
regimental
surgeon
very
soon
left
us
and
church
who
was
repeatedly
taken
down
with
the
fever
was
left
alone
save
as
he
was
helped
by
men
detailed
from
among
the
troopers
both
he
and
the
men
thus
detailed
together
with
the
regular
hospital
attendants
did
work
of
incalculable
service
we
had
no
ambulance
with
the
regiment
on
the
our
wounded
were
generally
sent
to
the
rear
in
or
on
litters
which
were
improvised
at
other
times
we
would
hire
the
little
springless
cuban
carts
but
of
course
the
wounded
suffered
greatly
in
such
conveyances
and
moreover
often
we
could
not
get
a
wheeled
vehicle
of
any
kind
to
transport
even
the
most
serious
cases
on
the
day
of
the
big
fight
july
as
far
as
we
could
find
out
there
were
but
two
ambulances
with
the
army
in
condition
to
work
neither
of
which
did
we
ever
see
later
there
were
as
we
were
informed
thirteen
all
told
and
occasionally
after
the
surrender
by
vigorous
representations
and
requests
we
would
get
one
assigned
to
take
some
peculiarly
bad
cases
to
the
hospital
ordinarily
however
we
had
to
do
with
one
of
the
makeshifts
enumerated
above
on
several
occasions
i
visited
the
big
hospitals
in
the
rear
their
condition
was
frightful
beyond
description
from
lack
of
supplies
lack
of
medicine
lack
of
doctors
nurses
and
attendants
and
especially
from
lack
of
transportation
the
wounded
and
sick
who
were
sent
back
suffered
so
much
that
whenever
possible
they
returned
to
the
front
finally
my
brigade
commander
general
wood
ordered
with
my
hearty
acquiescence
that
only
in
the
direst
need
should
any
men
be
sent
to
the
rear
no
matter
what
our
hospital
accommodations
at
the
front
might
be
the
men
themselves
preferred
to
suffer
almost
anything
lying
alone
in
their
little
rather
than
go
back
to
the
hospitals
in
the
rear
i
invite
attention
to
the
accompanying
letter
of
captain
llewellen
in
relation
to
the
dreadful
condition
of
the
wounded
on
some
of
the
transports
taking
them
north
the
greatest
trouble
we
had
was
with
the
lack
of
transportation
under
the
order
issued
by
direction
of
general
miles
through
the
on
or
about
may
a
regiment
serving
as
infantry
in
the
field
was
entitled
to
wagons
we
often
had
one
often
none
sometimes
two
and
never
as
many
as
three
we
had
a
regimental
but
it
was
left
behind
at
tampa
during
most
of
the
time
our
means
of
transportation
were
chiefly
the
improvised
spoken
of
above
but
as
the
mules
got
well
they
were
taken
away
from
us
and
so
were
the
captured
spanish
cavalry
horses
whenever
we
shifted
camp
we
had
to
leave
most
of
our
things
behind
so
that
the
night
before
each
fight
was
marked
by
our
sleeping
without
tentage
and
with
very
little
food
so
far
as
officers
were
concerned
as
everything
had
to
be
sacrificed
to
getting
up
what
ammunition
and
medical
supplies
we
had
colonel
wood
seized
some
mules
and
in
this
manner
got
up
the
medical
supplies
before
the
fight
of
june
when
for
three
days
the
officers
had
nothing
but
what
they
wore
there
was
a
repetition
of
this
only
in
worse
form
before
and
after
the
fight
of
july
of
course
much
of
this
was
simply
a
natural
incident
of
war
but
a
great
deal
could
readily
have
been
avoided
if
we
had
had
enough
transportation
and
i
was
sorry
not
to
let
my
men
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
rest
as
much
as
possible
just
before
going
into
a
fight
when
as
on
july
and
they
might
have
to
be
hours
with
the
minimum
quantity
of
food
and
sleep
the
fever
began
to
make
heavy
ravages
among
our
men
just
before
the
surrender
and
from
that
time
on
it
became
a
most
serious
matter
to
shift
camp
with
sick
and
ailing
soldiers
hardly
able
to
walk
not
to
speak
of
carrying
heavy
burdens
when
we
had
no
transportation
not
more
than
half
of
the
men
could
carry
their
rolls
and
yet
these
with
the
officers
baggage
and
provisions
the
entire
hospital
and
its
appurtenances
had
to
be
transported
somehow
it
was
usually
about
three
days
after
we
reached
a
new
camp
before
the
necessaries
which
had
been
left
behind
could
be
brought
up
and
during
these
three
days
we
had
to
get
along
as
best
we
could
the
entire
lack
of
transportation
at
first
resulted
in
leaving
most
of
the
troop
on
the
beach
and
we
were
never
able
to
get
them
the
men
cooked
in
the
few
utensils
they
could
themselves
carry
this
rendered
it
impossible
to
boil
the
closely
allied
to
the
lack
of
transportation
was
the
lack
of
means
to
land
supplies
from
the
transports
in
my
opinion
the
deficiency
in
transportation
was
the
worst
evil
with
which
we
had
to
contend
serious
though
some
of
the
others
were
i
have
never
served
before
so
have
no
means
of
comparing
this
with
previous
campaigns
i
was
often
told
by
officers
who
had
seen
service
against
the
indians
that
relatively
to
the
size
of
the
army
and
the
character
of
the
country
we
had
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
transportation
always
used
in
the
indian
campaigns
as
far
as
my
regiment
was
concerned
we
certainly
did
not
have
of
the
amount
absolutely
necessary
if
it
was
to
be
kept
in
fair
condition
and
we
had
to
partially
make
good
the
deficiency
by
the
most
energetic
resort
to
all
kinds
of
makeshifts

expedients

of

the

for
publication
shafter
sir
in
a
meeting
of
the
general
and
medical
officers
called
by
you
at
the
palace
this
morning
we
were
all
as
you
know
unanimous
in
our
views
of
what
should
be
done
with
the
army
to
keep
us
here
in
the
opinion
of
every
officer
commanding
a
division
or
a
brigade
will
simply
involve
the
destruction
of
thousands
there
is
no
possible
reason
for
not
shipping
practically
the
entire
command
north
at
once
cases
are
very
few
in
the
cavalry
division
where
i
command
one
of
the
two
brigades
and
not
one
true
case
of
yellow
fever
has
occurred
in
this
division
except
among
the
men
sent
to
the
hospital
at
siboney
where
they
have
i
believe
contracted
it
but
in
this
division
there
have
been
cases
of
malarial
fever
hardly
a
man
has
yet
died
from
it
but
the
whole
command
is
so
weakened
and
shattered
as
to
be
ripe
for
dying
like
rotten
sheep
when
a
real
epidemic
instead
of
a
fake
epidemic
like
the
present
one
strikes
us
as
it
is
bound
to
do
if
we
stay
here
at
the
height
of
the
sickness
season
august
and
the
beginning
of
september
quarantine
against
malarial
fever
is
much
like
quarantining
against
the
toothache
all
of
us
are
certain
that
as
soon
as
the
authorities
at
washington
fully
appreciate
the
condition
of
the
army
we
shall
be
sent
home
if
we
are
kept
here
it
will
in
all
human
possibility
mean
an
appalling
disaster
for
the
surgeons
here
estimate
that
over
half
the
army
if
kept
here
during
the
sickly
season
will
die
this
is
not
only
terrible
from
the
of
the
individual
lives
lost
but
it
means
ruin
from
the
of
military
efficiency
of
the
flower
of
the
american
army
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
regulars
are
here
with
you
the
sick
list
large
though
it
is
exceeding
four
thousand
affords
but
a
faint
index
of
the
debilitation
of
the
army
not
twenty
per
cent
are
fit
for
active
work
six
weeks
on
the
north
maine
coast
for
instance
or
elsewhere
where
the
germ
can
not
possibly
propagate
would
make
us
all
as
fit
as
as
able
as
we
are
eager
to
take
a
leading
part
in
the
great
campaign
against
havana
in
the
fall
even
if
we
are
not
allowed
to
try
porto
rico
we
can
be
moved
north
if
moved
at
once
with
absolute
safety
to
the
country
although
of
course
it
would
have
been
infinitely
better
if
we
had
been
moved
north
or
to
porto
rico
two
weeks
ago
if
there
were
any
object
in
keeping
us
here
we
would
face
yellow
fever
with
as
much
indifference
as
we
faced
bullets
but
there
is
no
object
the
four
immune
regiments
ordered
here
are
sufficient
to
garrison
the
city
and
surrounding
towns
and
there
is
absolutely
nothing
for
us
to
do
here
and
there
has
not
been
since
the
city
surrendered
it
is
impossible
to
move
into
the
interior
every
shifting
of
camp
doubles
the
in
our
present
weakened
condition
and
anyhow
the
interior
is
rather
worse
than
the
coast
as
i
have
found
by
actual
reconnaissance
our
present
camps
are
as
healthy
as
any
camps
at
this
end
of
the
island
can
be
i
write
only
because
i
can
not
see
our
men
who
have
fought
so
bravely
and
who
have
endured
extreme
hardship
and
danger
so
uncomplainingly
go
to
destruction
without
striving
so
far
as
lies
in
me
to
avert
a
doom
as
fearful
as
it
is
unnecessary
and
undeserved

respectfully
theodore
roosevelt
colonel
commanding

cavalry
brigade
after
colonel
roosevelt
had
taken
the
initiative
all
the
american
general
officers
united
in
a
round
robin
addressed
to
general
shafter
it
reads
we
the
undersigned
officers
commanding
the
various
brigades
divisions
of
the
army
of
occupation
in
cuba
are
of
the
unanimous
opinion
that
this
army
should
be
at
once
taken
out
of
the
island
of
cuba
and
sent
to
some
point
on
the
northern
of
the
united
states
that
can
be
done
without
danger
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
that
yellow
fever
in
the
army
at
present
is
not
epidemic
that
there
are
only
a
few
sporadic
cases
but
that
the
army
is
disabled
by
malarial
fever
to
the
extent
that
its
efficiency
is
destroyed
and
that
it
is
in
a
condition
to
be
practically
entirely
destroyed
by
an
epidemic
of
yellow
fever
which
is
sure
to
come
in
the
near
future
we
know
from
the
reports
of
competent
officers
and
from
personal
observations
that
the
army
is
unable
to
move
into
the
interior
and
that
there
are
no
facilities
for
such
a
move
if
attempted
and
that
it
could
not
be
attempted
until
too
late
moreover
the
best
medical
authorities
of
the
island
say
that
with
our
present
equipment
we
could
not
live
in
the
interior
during
the
rainy
season
without
losses
from
malarial
fever
which
is
almost
as
deadly
as
yellow
fever
this
army
must
be
moved
at
once
or
perish
as
the
army
can
be
safely
moved
now
the
persons
responsible
for
preventing
such
a
move
will
be
responsible
for
the
unnecessary
loss
of
many
thousands
of
lives
our
opinions
are
the
result
of
careful
personal
observation
and
they
are
also
based
on
the
unanimous
opinion
of
our
medical
officers
with
the
army
who
understand
the
situation

this

because

of

at

appendix
d
corrections
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
when
bucky
spoke
of
the
vultures
tearing
our
dead
he
was
thinking
of
no
modern
poet
but
of
the
words
of
the
prophet
ezekiel
speak
unto
every
feathered
fowl
ye
shall
eat
the

of

mighty
and
drink

of

princes
of

earth
at
san
juan
the
sixth
cavalry
was
under
major
lebo
a
tried
and
gallant
officer
i
learn
from
a
letter
of
lieutenant
mcnamee
that
it
was
he
and
not
lieutenant
hartwick
by
whose
orders
the
troopers
of
the
ninth
cast
down
the
fence
to
enable
me
to
ride
my
horse
into
the
lane
but
one
of
the
two
lieutenants
of
b
troop
was
overcome
by
the
heat
that
day
lieutenant
rynning
was
with
his
troop
until
dark
one
night
during
the
siege
when
we
were
digging
trenches
a
curious
stampede
occurred
not
in
my
own
regiment
which
it
may
be
necessary
some
time
to
relate
lieutenants
shipp
and
smith
were
killed
not
far
from
each
other
while
gallantly
leading
their
troops
on
the
slope
of

hill
each
left

widow
and
young
children
captain
now
colonel
mills
the
brigade
has
written
me
some
comments
on
my
account
of
the
fight
on
july
it
was
he
himself
who
first
brought
me
word
to
advance
i
then
met
colonel
dorst
who
bore
the
same
message
as
i
was
getting
the
regiment
forward
captain
mills
was
one
of
the
officers
i
had
sent
back
to
get
orders
that
would
permit
me
to
advance
he
met
general
sumner
who
gave
him
the
orders
and
he
then
returned
to
me
in
a
letter
to
me
colonel
mills
says
in
part
i
reached
the
head
of
the
regiment
as
you
came
out
of
the
lane
and
gave
you
the
orders
to
enter
the
action
these
were
that
you
were
to
move
with
your
right
resting
along
the
wire
fence
of
the
lane
to
the
support
of
the
regular
cavalry
then
attacking
the
hill
we
were
facing
the
house
yonder
is
your
objective
i
said
to
you
you
moved
out
at
once
and
quickly
forged
to
the
front
of
your
regiment
i
rode
in
rear
keeping
the
soldiers
and
troops
closed
and
in
line
as
well
as
the
circumstances
and
conditions
permitted
we
had
covered
i
judge
from
to
the
distance
to
kettle
hill
when
garlington
from
our
left
flank
called
to
me
that
troops
were
needed
in
the
meadow
across
the
lane
i
put
one
troop
not
three
as
stated
in
your
across
the
lane
and
went
with
it
advancing
with
the
troop
i
began
immediately
to
pick
up
troopers
of
the
ninth
cavalry
who
had
drifted
from
their
commands
and
soon
had
so
many
they
demanded
nearly
all
my
attention
with
a
line
thus
made
up
the
colored
troopers
on
the
left
and
yours
on
the
right
the
portion
of
kettle
hill
on
the
right
of
the
house
was
first
carried
i
very
shortly
thereafter
had
a
strong
established
on
the
crest
nearest
the
enemy
from
the
corner
of
the
fence
around
the
house
to
the
low
ground
on
the
right
of
the
hill
which
fired
into
the
strong
line
of
conical
straw
hats
whose
brims
showed
just
above
the
edge
of
the
spanish
trench
directly
west
of
that
part
of
the
hill
these
hats
made
a
fine
target
i
had
placed
a
young
officer
of
your
regiment
in
charge
of
the
portion
of
the
line
on
top
of
the
hill
and
was
about
to
go
to
the
left
to
keep
the
connection
of
the
brigade
captain
mcblain
ninth
cavalry
just
then
came
up
on
the
hill
from
the
left
and
rear
when
the
shot
struck
that
put
me
out
of
the
fight
note
the
other
two
must
have
followed
on
their
own
initiative
note
these
were
the
spaniards
in
the
trenches
we
carried
when
we
charged
from
kettle
hill
after
the
infantry
had
taken
the
san
juan
there
were
many
wholly
erroneous
accounts
of
the
guasimas
fight
published
at
the
time
for
the
most
part
written
by
who
were
in
the
rear
and
utterly
ignorant
of
what
really
occurred
most
of
these
accounts
possess
a
value
so
purely
ephemeral
as
to
need
no
notice
stephen
bonsal
however
in
his
book
the
fight
for
santiago
has
cast
one
of
them
in
a
more
permanent
form
and
i
shall
discuss
one
or
two
of
his
statements
bonsal
was
not
present
at
the
fight
and
indeed
so
far
as
i
know
he
never
at
any
time
was
with
the
cavalry
in
action
he
puts
in
his
book
a
map
of
the
supposed
skirmish
ground
but
it
bears
to
the
actual
scene
of
the
fight
only
the
likeness
borne
by
monmouth
to
macedon
there
was
a
brook
on
the
and
there
is
a
brook
in
bonsal
map
the
real
brook
flowing
down
from
the
mountains
crossed
the
valley
road
and
ran
down
between
it
and
the
going
nowhere
near
the
latter
the
bonsal
brook
flows
at
right
angles
to
the
course
of
the
real
brook
and
crosses
both
trails
that
is
it
runs
up
hill
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
bonsal
map
could
have
been
made
by
any
man
who
had
gone
over
the
followed
by
the
rough
riders
and
who
knew
where
the
fighting
had
taken
place
the
position
of
the
spanish
line
on
the
bonsal
map
is
inverted
compared
to
what
it
really
was
on
page
bonsal
says
that
in
making
the
precipitate
advance
there
was
a
rivalry
between
the
regulars
and
rough
riders
which
resulted
in
each
hurrying
recklessly
forward
to
strike
the
spaniards
first
on
the
contrary
the
official
reports
show
that
general
column
waited
for
some
time
after
it
got
to
the
spanish
position
so
as
to
allow
the
rough
riders
who
had
the
more
difficult
trail
to
come
up
colonel
wood
kept
his
column
walking
at
a
smart
pace
merely
so
that
the
regulars
might
not
be
left
unsupported
when
the
fight
began
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
began
almost
simultaneously
on
both
wings
on
page
bonsal
speaks
of
the
foolhardy
formation
of
a
solid
column
along
a
narrow
trail
which
brought
them
the
rough
riders
within
range
of
the
spanish
rifles
and
within
the
unobstructed
sweep
of
their
he
also
speaks
as
if
the
advance
should
have
been
made
with
the
regiment
deployed
through
the
jungle
of
course
the
only
possible
way
by
which
the
rough
riders
could
have
been
brought
into
action
in
time
to
support
the
regulars
was
by
advancing
in
column
along
the
trail
at
a
good
smart
gait
as
soon
as
our
came
into
contact
with
the
enemy
outpost
we
deployed
no
firing
began
for
at
least
five
minutes
after
captain
capron
sent
back
word
that
he
had
come
upon
the
spanish
outpost
at
the
particular
point
where
this
occurred
there
was
a
dip
in
the
road
which
probably
rendered
it
in
capron
opinion
better
to
keep
part
of
his
men
in
it
in
any
event
captain
capron
who
was
as
skilful
as
he
was
gallant
had
ample
time
between
discovering
the
spanish
outpost
and
the
outbreak
of
the
firing
to
arrange
his
troop
in
the
formation
he
deemed
best
his
troop
was
not
in
solid
formation
his
men
were
about
ten
yards
apart
of
course
to
have
walked
forward
deployed
through
the
jungle
prior
to
reaching
the
ground
where
we
were
to
fight
would
have
been
a
course
of
procedure
so
foolish
as
to
warrant
the
summary
of
any
man
directing
it
we
could
not
have
made
half
a
mile
an
hour
in
such
a
formation
and
would
have
been
at
least
four
hours
too
late
for
the
fighting
on
page
bonsal
says
that
captain
capron
troop
was
ambushed
and
that
it
received
the
enemy
fire
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
was
expected
this
is
simply
not
so
before
the
column
stopped
we
had
passed
a
dead
cuban
killed
in
the
preceding
day
skirmish
and
general
wood
had
notified
me
on
information
he
had
received
from
capron
that
we
might
come
into
contact
with
the
spaniards
at
any
moment
and
as
i
have
already
said
captain
capron
discovered
the
spanish
outpost
and
we
halted
and
partially
deployed
the
column
before
the
firing
began
we
were
at
the
time
exactly
where
we
had
expected
to
come
across
the
spaniards
bonsal
after
speaking
of
l
troop
adds
the
remaining
troops
of
the
regiment
had
travelled
more
leisurely
and
more
than
half
an
hour
elapsed
before
they
came
up
to
capron
support
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
troops
travelled
at
exactly
the
same
rate
of
speed
although
there
were
stragglers
from
each
and
when
capron
halted
and
sent
back
word
that
he
had
come
upon
the
spanish
outpost
the
entire
regiment
closed
up
halted
and
most
of
the
men
sat
down
we
then
some
minutes
after
the
first
word
had
been
received
and
before
any
firing
had
begun
received
instructions
to
deploy
i
had
my
right
wing
partially
deployed
before
the
first
shots
between
the
outposts
took
place
within
less
than
three
minutes
i
had
g
troop
with
llewellen
greenway
and
leahy
and
one
platoon
of
k
troop
under
kane
on
the
and
it
was
not
until
after
we
reached
the
that
the
heavy
from
the
spaniards
began
on
page
bonsal
says
a
vexatious
delay
occurred
before
the
two
independent
columns
could
communicate
and
advance
with
concerted
action
when
the
two
columns
were
brought
into
communication
it
was
immediately
decided
to
make
a
general
attack
upon
the
spanish
position
with
this
purpose
in
view
the
following
disposition
of
the
troops
was
made
before
the
advance
of
the
brigade
all
along
the
line
was
ordered
there
was
no
communication
between
the
two
columns
prior
to
the
general
attack
nor
was
any
order
issued
for
the
advance
of
the
brigade
all
along
the
line
the
attacks
were
made
wholly
independently
and
the
first
communication
between
the
columns
was
when
the
right
wing
of
the
rough
riders
in
the
course
of
their
advance
by
their
firing
dislodged
the
spaniards
from
the
hill
across
the
ravine
to
the
right
and
then
saw
the
regulars
come
up
that
hill
bonsal
account
of
what
occurred
among
the
regulars
parallels
his
account
of
what
occurred
among
the
rough
riders
he
states
that
the
squadron
of
the
tenth
cavalry
delivered
the
main
attack
upon
the
hill
which
was
the
strongest
point
of
the
spanish
position
and
he
says
of
the
troopers
of
the
tenth
cavalry
that
their
better
training
enabled
them
to
render
more
valuable
service
than
the
other
troops
engaged
in
reality
the
tenth
cavalrymen
were
deployed
in
support
of
the
first
though
they
mingled
with
them
in
the
assault
proper
and
so
far
as
there
was
any
difference
at
all
in
the
amount
of
work
done
it
was
in
favor
of
the
first
the
statement
that
the
tenth
cavalry
was
better
trained
than
the
first
and
rendered
more
valuable
service
has
not
the
slightest
basis
whatsoever
of
any
kind
sort
or
description
in
fact
the
tenth
cavalry
did
well
what
it
was
required
to
do
as
an
organization
in
this
fight
it
was
rather
less
heavily
engaged
and
suffered
less
loss
actually
and
relatively
than
either
the
first
cavalry
or
the
rough
riders
it
took
about
the
same
part
that
was
taken
by
the
left
wing
of
the
rough
riders
which
wing
was
similarly
rather
less
heavily
engaged
than
the
right
and
centre
of
the
regiment
of
course
this
is
a
reflection
neither
on
the
tenth
cavalry
nor
on
the
left
wing
of
the
rough
riders
each
body
simply
did
what
it
was
ordered
to
do
and
did
it
well
but
to
claim
that
the
tenth
cavalry
did
better
than
the
first
or
bore
the
most
prominent
part
in
the
fight
is
like
making
the
same
claim
for
the
left
wing
of
the
rough
riders
all
the
troops
engaged
did
well
and
all
alike
are
entitled
to
share
in
the
honor
of
the
day
bonsal
the
spaniards
themselves
as
regards
both
their
numbers
and
their
loss
these
points
are
discussed
elsewhere
he
develops
for
the
spanish
side
to
account
for
their
retreat
a
wholly
new
explanation
that
they
retreated
because
they
saw
reinforcements
arriving
for
the
americans
the
spaniards
themselves
make
no
such
claim
lieutenant
tejeiro
asserts
that
they
retreated
because
news
had
come
of
a
wholly
mythical
american
advance
on
morro
castle
the
spanish
official
report
simply
says
that
the
americans
were
repulsed
which
is
about
as
accurate
a
statement
as
the
other
two
all
three
explanations
those
by
general
rubin
by
lieutenant
tejeiro
and
by
bonsal
alike
are
precisely
on
a
par
with
the
first
spanish
official
report
of
the
battle
of
manila
bay
in
which
admiral
dewey
was
described
as
having
been
repulsed
and
forced
to
retire
there
are
one
or
two
minor
mistakes
made
by
bonsal
he
states
that
on
the
roster
of
the
officers
of
the
rough
riders
there
were
ten
west
pointers
there
were
three
one
of
whom
resigned
only
two
were
in
the
fighting
he
also
states
that
after
las
guasimas
young
was
made
a
and
colonel
wood
a
while
the
commanding
officers
of
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
were
ignored
in
this
shower
of
promotions
in
the
first
place
the
commanding
officers
of
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
were
not
in
the
fight
only
one
squadron
of
each
having
been
present
in
the
next
place
there
was
no
shower
of
promotions
at
all
nobody
was
promoted
except
general
young
save
to
fill
the
vacancies
caused
by
death
or
by
the
promotion
of
general
young
wood
was
not
promoted
because
of
this
fight
general
young
most
deservedly
was
promoted
soon
after
the
fight
he
fell
sick
the
command
of
the
brigade
then
fell
upon
wood
simply
because
he
had
higher
rank
than
the
other
two
regimental
commanders
of
the
brigade
and
i
then
took
command
of
the
regiment
exactly
as
veile
and
baldwin
had
already
taken
command
of
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
when
their
superior
officers
were
put
in
charge
of
brigades
after
the
san
juan
fighting
in
which
wood
commanded
a
brigade
he
was
made
a
and
i
was
then
promoted
to
the
nominal
command
of
the
regiment
which
i
was
already
commanding
in
reality
bonsal
claim
of
superior
efficiency
for
the
colored
regular
regiments
as
compared
with
the
white
regular
regiments
does
not
merit
discussion
he
asserts
that
general
wheeler
brought
on
the
guasimas
fight
in
defiance
of
orders
lieutenant
miley
in
his
book
in
cuba
with
shafter
on
page
shows
that
general
wheeler
made
his
fight
before
receiving
the
order
which
it
is
claimed
he
disobeyed
general
wheeler
was
in
command
ashore
he
was
told
to
get
in
touch
with
the
enemy
and
being
a
man
with
the
fighting
edge
this
meant
that
he
was
certain
to
fight
no
general
who
was
worth
his
salt
would
have
failed
to
fight
under
such
conditions
the
only
question
would
be
as
to
how
the
fight
was
to
be
made
war
means
fighting
and
the
cardinal
sin
is
timidity
general
wheeler
remained
throughout
steadfast
against
any
retreat
from
before
santiago
but
the
merit
of
keeping
the
army
before
santiago
without
withdrawal
until
the
city
fell
belongs
to
the
authorities
at
washington
who
at
this
stage
of
the
operations
showed
to
marked
advantage
in
overruling
the
proposals
made
by
the
highest
generals
in
the
field
looking
toward
partial
retreat
or
toward
the
abandonment
of
the
effort
to
take
the
city
the
following
note
written
by
sergeant
norton
of
b
troop
refers
to
the
death
of
his
brother
oliver
norton
one
of
the
most
gallant
and
soldierly
men
in
the
regiment
on
july
i
together
with
sergeant
campbell
and
troopers
bardshar
and
dudley
dean
and
my
brother
who
was
killed
and
some
others
was
at
the
front
of
the
column
right
behind
you
we
moved
forward
following
you
as
you
rode
to
where
we
came
upon
the
troopers
of
the
ninth
cavalry
and
a
part
of
the
first
lying
down
i
heard
the
conversation
between
you
and
one
or
two
of
the
officers
of
the
ninth
cavalry
you
ordered
a
charge
and
the
regular
officers
answered
that
they
had
no
orders
to
move
ahead
whereupon
you
said
then
let
us
through
and
marched
forward
through
the
lines
our
regiment
following
the
men
of
the
ninth
and
first
cavalry
then
jumped
up
and
came
forward
with
us
then
you
waved
your
hat
and
gave
the
command
to
charge
and
we
went
up
the
hill
on
the
top
of
kettle
hill
my
brother
oliver
norton
was
shot
through
the
head
and
in
the
right
wrist
it
was
just
as
you
started
to
lead
the
charge
on
the
san
juan
hills
ahead
of
us
we
saw
that
the
regiment
did
not
know
you
had
gone
and
were
not
following
and
my
brother
said
for
god
sake
follow
the
colonel
and
as
he
rose
the
bullet
went
through
his
head
in
reference
to
bonsal
account
of
the
guasimas
fight
richard
harding
davis
writes
me
as
follows
we
had
already
halted
several
times
to
give
the
men
a
chance
to
rest
and
when
we
halted
for
the
last
time
i
thought
it
was
for
this
same
purpose
and
began
taking
photographs
of
the
men
of
l
troop
who
were
so
near
that
they
asked
me
to
be
sure
and
save
them
a
photograph
wood
had
twice
disappeared
down
the
trail
beyond
them
and
returned
as
he
came
back
for
the
second
time
i
remember
that
you
walked
up
to
him
we
were
all
dismounted
then
and
saluted
and
said
colonel
doctor
la
motte
reports
that
the
pace
is
too
fast
for
the
men
and
that
over
fifty
have
fallen
out
from
exhaustion
wood
replied
sharply
i
have
no
time
to
bother
with
sick
men
now
you
replied
more
in
answer
i
suppose
to
his
tone
than
to
his
words
i
merely
repeated
what
the
surgeon
reported
to
me
wood
then
turned
and
said
in
explanation
i
have
no
time
for
them
now
i
mean
that
we
are
in
sight
of
the
enemy
this
was
the
only
information
we
received
that
the
men
of
l
troop
had
been
ambushed
by
the
spaniards
and
if
they
were
they
were
very
calm
about
it
and
i
certainly
was
taking
photographs
of
them
at
the
time
and
the
rest
of
the
regiment
instead
of
being
half
an
hour
march
away
was
seated
comfortably
along
the
trail
not
twenty
feet
distant
from
the
men
of
l
troop
you
deployed
g
troop
under
captain
llewellen
into
the
jungle
at
the
right
and
sent
k
troop
after
it
and
wood
ordered
troops
e
and
f
into
the
field
on
our
left
it
must
have
been
from
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
after
capron
and
wood
had
located
the
spaniards
before
either
side
fired
a
shot
when
the
firing
did
come
i
went
over
to
you
and
joined
g
troop
and
a
detachment
of
k
troop
under
woodbury
kane
and
we
located
more
of
the
enemy
on
a
ridge
if
it
is
to
be
ambushed
when
you
find
the
enemy
exactly
where
you
went
to
find
him
and
your
scouts
see
him
soon
enough
to
give
you
sufficient
time
to
spread
five
troops
in
skirmish
order
to
attack
him
and
you
then
drive
him
back
out
of
three
positions
for
a
mile
and
a
half
then
most
certainly
as
bonsal
says
l
troop
of
the
rough
riders
was
ambushed
by
the
spaniards
on
the
morning
of
june
general
wood
also
writes
me
at
length
about
bonsal
book
stating
that
his
account
of
the
guasimas
fight
is
without
foundation
in
fact
he
says
we
had
five
troops
completely
deployed
before
the
first
shot
was
fired
captain
capron
was
not
wounded
until
the
fight
had
been
going
on
fully
minutes
the
statement
that
captain
capron
troop
was
ambushed
is
absolutely
untrue
we
had
been
informed
as
you
know
by
castillo
people
that
we
should
find
the
dead
guerilla
a
few
hundred
yards
on
the
siboney
side
of
the
spanish
lines
he
then
alludes
to
the
waving
of
the
guidon
by
k
troop
as
the
only
means
of
communication
with
the
regulars
he
mentions
that
his
orders
did
not
come
from
general
wheeler
and
that
he
had
no
instructions
from
general
wheeler
directly
or
indirectly
at
any
time
previous
to
the
fight
general
wood
does
not
think
that
i
give
quite
enough
credit
to
the
rough
riders
as
compared
to
the
regulars
in
this
guasimas
fight
and
believes
that
i
greatly
underestimate
the
spanish
force
and
loss
and
that
lieutenant
tejeiro
is
not
to
be
trusted
at
all
on
these
points
he
states
that
we
began
the
fight
ten
minutes
before
the
regulars
and
that
the
main
attack
was
made
and
decided
by
us
this
was
the
view
that
i
and
all
the
rest
of
us
in
the
regiment
took
at
the
time
but
as
i
had
found
since
that
the
members
of
the
first
and
tenth
regular
regiments
held
with
equal
sincerity
the
view
that
the
main
part
was
taken
by
their
own
commands
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
way
i
have
described
the
action
is
substantially
correct
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
tenth
cavalry
which
was
originally
in
support
moved
forward
until
it
got
mixed
with
the
first
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
the
exact
relative
position
of
the
different
troops
of
the
first
and
tenth
in
making
the
advance
beck
and
galbraith
were
on
the
left
apparently
wainwright
was
farthest
over
on
the
right
general
wood
states
that
leonardo
ros
the
civil
governor
of
santiago
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
told
him
that
the
spanish
force
at
guasimas
consisted
of
not
less
than
men
and
that
there
were
nearly
of
them
killed
and
wounded
i
do
not
myself
see
how
it
was
possible
for
us
as
we
were
the
attacking
party
and
were
advancing
against
superior
numbers
well
sheltered
to
inflict
five
times
as
much
damage
as
we
received
but
as
we
buried
eleven
dead
spaniards
and
as
they
carried
off
some
of
their
dead
i
believe
the
loss
to
have
been
very
much
heavier
than
lieutenant
tejeiro
reports
general
wood
believes
that
in
following
lieutenant
tejeiro
i
have
greatly
underestimated
the
number
of
spanish
troops
who
were
defending
santiago
on
july
and
here
i
think
he
completely
makes
out
his
case
he
taking
the
view
that
lieutenant
tejeiro
statements
were
made
for
the
purpose
of
saving
spanish
honor
on
this
point
his
letter
runs
as
follows
a
word
in
regard
to
the
number
of
troops
in
santiago
i
have
had
during
my
long
association
here
a
good
many
opportunities
to
get
information
which
you
have
not
got
and
probably
never
will
get
that
is
information
from
parties
who
were
actually
in
the
fight
who
are
now
residents
of
the
city
also
information
which
came
to
me
as
commanding
officer
of
the
city
directly
after
the
surrender
to
sum
up
briefly
as
follows
the
spanish
surrendered
in
santiago
men
we
shipped
from
santiago
something
over
men
the
additional
were
troops
that
came
in
from
san
luis
songo
and
small
posts
the
in
the
city
minus
the
force
of
general
iscario
infantry
and
cavalry
or
in
round
numbers
men
who
entered
the
city
just
after
the
battles
of
san
juan
and
el
caney
leaves
regulars
plus
the
dead
plus
marines
and
which
he
himself
admits
landing
in
the
neighborhood
of
and
reports
here
are
that
he
landed
and
plus
the
spanish
volunteer
battalion
which
was
between
and
men
this
statement
i
have
from
the
of
this
very
battalion
gives
us
in
round
numbers
present
for
duty
on
the
morning
of
july
not
less
than
men
these
men
were
distributed
at
caney
two
companies
of
artillery
at
morro
one
at
socapa
and
half
a
company
at
puenta
gorda
in
all
not
over
or
men
but
for
the
sake
of
argument
we
can
say
a
thousand
in
round
numbers
then
we
had
immediately
about
the
city
troops
these
were
scattered
from
the
cemetery
around
to
aguadores
in
front
of
us
actually
in
the
trenches
there
could
not
by
any
possible
method
of
figuring
have
been
less
than
men
you
can
twist
it
any
way
you
want
to
the
figures
i
have
given
you
are
absolutely
correct
at
least
they
are
absolutely
on
the
side
of
safety
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
withstand
the
temptation
to
tell
what
has
befallen
some
of
my
men
since
the
regiment
disbanded
how
mcginty
after
spending
some
weeks
in
roosevelt
hospital
in
new
york
with
an
attack
of
fever
determined
to
call
upon
his
captain
woodbury
kane
when
he
got
out
and
procuring
a
horse
rode
until
he
found
house
when
he
hitched
the
horse
to
a
and
strolled
in
how
cherokee
bill
married
a
wife
in
hoboken
and
as
that
pleasant
city
ultimately
proved
an
uncongenial
field
for
his
activities
how
i
had
to
send
both
himself
and
his
wife
out
to
the
territory
how
happy
jack
haunted
by
visions
of
the
social
methods
obtaining
in
the
best
saloons
of
arizona
applied
for
the
position
of
bouncer
out
at
the
executive
chamber
when
i
was
elected
governor
and
how
i
got
him
a
job
at
railroading
instead
and
finally
had
to
ship
him
back
to
his
own
territory
also
how
a
valued
friend
from
a
cow
ranch
in
the
remote
west
accepted
a
pressing
invitation
to
spend
a
few
days
at
the
home
of
another
a
new
yorker
of
fastidious
instincts
and
arrived
with
an
umbrella
as
his
only
baggage
how
poor
holderman
and
pollock
both
died
and
were
buried
with
military
honors
all
of
tribesmen
coming
to
the
burial
how
tom
isbell
joined
buffalo
wild
west
show
and
how
on
the
other
hand
george
rowland
scornfully
refused
to
remain
in
the
east
at
all
writing
to
a
gallant
young
new
yorker
who
had
been
his
bunkie
well
old
boy
i
am
glad
i
did
go
home
with
you
for
them
people
to
look
at
because
i
ai
a
buffalo
or
a
rhinoceros
or
a
giraffe
and
i
do
like
to
be
stared
at
and
you
know
we
did
do
no
hard
fighting
down
there
i
have
been
in
closer
places
than
that
right
here
in
united
states
that
is
better
men
to
fight
than
them
dam
spaniards
in
another
letter
rowland
tells
of
the
fate
of
tom
darnell
the
rider
he
who
rode
the
sorrel
horse
of
the
third
cavalry
there
ai
much
news
to
write
of
except
poor
old
tom
darnell
got
killed
about
a
month
ago
tom
and
another
fellow
had
a
fight
and
he
shot
tom
through
the
heart
and
tom
was
dead
when
he
hit
the
floor
tom
was
sure
a
good
old
boy
and
i
sure
hated
to
hear
of
him
going
and
he
had
plenty
of
grit
too
no
man
ever
called
on
him
for
a
fight
that
he
did
get
it
my
men
were
children
of
the
dragon
blood
and
if
they
had
no
outland
foe
to
fight
and
no
outlet
for
their
vigorous
and
daring
energy
there
was
always
the
chance
of
their
fighting
one
another
but
the
great
majority
if
given
the
chance
to
do
hard
or
dangerous
work
availed
themselves
of
it
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
though
fever
sickened
and
weakened
them
so
that
many
died
from
it
during
the
few
months
following
their
return
yet
as
a
whole
they
are
now
doing
fairly
well
a
few
have
shot
other
men
or
been
shot
themselves
a
few
ran
for
office
and
got
elected
like
llewellen
and
luna
in
new
mexico
or
defeated
like
brodie
and
wilcox
in
arizona
some
have
been
trying
hard
to
get
to
the
philippines
some
have
returned
to
college
or
to
the
law
or
the
factory
or
the
most
of
them
have
gone
back
to
the
mine
the
ranch
and
the
hunting
camp
and
the
great
majority
have
taken
up
the
threads
of
their
lives
where
they
dropped
them
when
the
maine
was
blown
up
and
the
country
called
to
arms
