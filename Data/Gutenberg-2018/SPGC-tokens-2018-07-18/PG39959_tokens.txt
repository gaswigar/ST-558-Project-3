chap
i
and
he
said
unto
satan
whence
comest
thou
and
he
answered
and
said
thou
knowest
it
is
true
that
i
come
from
wandering
on
the
earth
and
from
going
to
and
fro
on
it
like
a
masterless
dog
with
my
boyd
at
the
very
time
they
were
disputing
about
the
right
of
tam
to
proceed
with
his
tale
their
ears
were
astounded
by
a
loud
hollo
at
the
gate
every
man
heart
leaped
for
joy
and
every
one
was
instantly
on
his
feet
but
charlie
was
first
on
the
platform
and
answered
the
hollo
with
full
stentorian
voice
the
same
voice
called
again
a
bellandine
where
bye
answered
charlie
by
the
moon
said
the
voice
and
the
seven
stars
rejoined
yardbire
clapping
his
hands
and
shouting
for
joy
the
warden
for
ever
my
chief
for
ever
he
is
the
man
that
cares
for
his
own
ah
he
is
the
noble
master
charlie
well
knew
the
voice
that
hailed
him
it
was
that
of
his
friend
and
companion
in
arms
dan
chisholm
whom
the
warden
had
indeed
despatched
all
the
way
from
northumberland
to
aikwood
to
see
what
was
become
of
his
embassy
with
chosen
troopers
charlie
scott
arm
was
a
bulwark
of
strength
and
his
breast
a
tower
of
fidelity
the
value
of
which
sir
ringan
knew
how
to
estimate
while
his
acts
of
kindness
and
regard
made
a
deep
impression
on
honest
unsophisticated
heart
and
before
he
would
say
a
word
about
the
situation
of
either
himself
or
his
associates
he
caused
dan
to
inform
him
of
the
warden
fortune
and
success
in
their
absence
being
satisfied
concerning
these
he
called
out
what
ither

o

and
the

been
rent
asunder
and
riddled
up
like
heaps
o

thought
that
there
has
been
a
siege
o

and
that
the
citadel
has
been
won
for
the
deils

a
broken

they

and

in
this
castle
for

a
imprisoned
on
the
top
of
it
and
famishing
to
dead
hunger
and
starvation
that
i
will
do
wi
a
expedition
answered
dan
it
is
a
shame
for
the
master
of
the
castle
to
imprison
his
kinsmen
friends
who
came
to
him
in
peace
and
good
fellowship
what
strength
of
opposition
holds
he
nane
good
chisholm
but
these
gates
the
great
master
is
himself
a
prisoner
and
suffering
with
us
that
dings
a
said
dan
i
canna
understand
it
but
its
a
ane
for
that

maunna
stay
there
i
shall
gar

gates
flee
a
into
as
mony
flinders
as
there
are
hairs
on
his
grey
beard
if
you
demolish
one
bar
of
these
gates
young
man
cried
the
master
fiercely
you
do
it
at
your
peril
so
i
do
and
so
i
will
answered
dan
either
bring
down
my
friends
and
companions
to
me
this
instant
or
i
have
orders
and
here
goes
man
of
mystery
and
of
misery
what
dost
thou
mean
said
the
friar
lo
i
have
saved
thy
life
and
if
thou
refusest
to
let
us
escape
from
the
face
of
death
i
will
even
throw
thee
from
the
top
of
thy
tower
and
thy
blood
shall
be
sprinkled
on
the
wall
the
master
gave
him
a
fierce
look
but
made
no
reply
as
he
strode
the
battlement
however
he
muttered
to
himself
with
great
violence
does
the
christian
dog
dare
to
beard
me
thus
to
what
am
i
fallen
i
am
fallen
low
but
not
to
this
and
not
to
know
what
i
am
nor
what
power
remains
with
me
would
that
i
were
in
the
midst
of
my
arcana
and
of
the
spirits
once
more
young
warrior
use
your
liberty
break
up
and
demolish
set
us
all
free
and
see
who
is
the
profiter
dan
scarcely
needed
such
permission
he
and
twenty
others
had
each
a
stone
of
at
least
half
his
own
weight
heaved
on
his
shoulder
which
at
a
given
signal
they
all
dashed
on
the
gate
at
once
the
bars
bent
but
nothing
gave
way
and
it
was
not
before
the
twentieth
broadside
in
the
same
irresistible
style
that
the
cross
bars
became
like
a
bow
and
the
lock
slipped
as
for
the
large
bolt
one
of
the
men
had
climbed
over
the
counterguard
on
the
shoulders
of
the
rest
and
drawn
it
when
they
came
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
entrance
seemed
hopeless
it
was
stedfast
and
immoveable
the
door
being
double
dan
bellowed
for
the
porter
and
asked
those
on
the
top
what
was
become
of
him
but
none
made
answer
to
his
rash
question
after
waiting
a
while
for
it
with
his
face
placed
horizontally
he
muttered
to
himself
aha
mum
there
he
has
gane
nae
gude
gate
i
warrant
him
it
a
queer
place
this
an
as
queer
folk
about
it
what
queer
about
it
lad
said
a
strange
voice
through
the
key
hole
whence
it
would
not
speak
again
they
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
begin
with
such
awkward
mattocks
as
they
had
namely
a
score
of
huge
stones
but
to
their
excessive
joy
the
doors
gave
both
way
at
the
first
assault
this
was
owing
to
a
most
fortunate
blunder
of
the
friar
who
during
the
time
he
was
in
possession
of
the
keys
had
gone
forth
to
provide
for
his
mule
which
he
did
in
an
ample
manner
but
on
returning
had
either
been
unable
or
unwilling
to
turn
the
tremendous
locks
again
into
their
sockets
and
open
flew
the
gates
with
a
jarring
sound
of
course
it
was
not
long
till
our
yeomen
were
thundering
at
the
iron
door
on
the
small
stair
it
was
a
double
door
of
strong
iron
bars
and
the
lock
was
inclosed
between
them
so
that
all
attempts
to
open
it
appeared
fruitless
one
man
only
being
able
to
get
to
it
at
once
that
is
one
on
each
side
and
these
had
no
footing
after
tugging
at
it
in
vain
for
a
space
dan
swore
that
to
open
it
it
would
be
necessary
either
to
begin
at
the
top
of
the
tower
and
demolish
downward
or
at
the
bottom
and
demolish
upward
this
appeared
a
job
so
tedious
to
starving
people
that
it
was
agreed
to
feed
them
with
meat
and
drink
through
the
bars
every
man
readily
proffered
the
contents
of
his
wallet
but
the
getting
of
these
through
the
bars
required
ingenuity
they
poured
the
meal
through
in
tubes
made
of
leather
and
water
and
strong
drink
in
the
same
way
but
the
flesh
could
only
be
got
through
in
long
small
pieces
and
tam
craik
having
taken
his
station
at
the
back
of
the
door
in
order
to
hand
up
the
provisions
to
his
companions
none
of
the
as
it
is
now
called
found
its
way
farther
by
the
time
they
had
got
a
supply
of
meal
water
and
distilled
liquor
some
of
dan
party
by
the
direction
of
the
master
went
to
bring
mattocks
for
raising
the
stair
and
forcing
a
passage
through
below
the
door
others
had
gone
to
the
brook
for
more
water
so
that
none
remained
in
the
narrow
stair
save
dan
chisholm
and
another
person
by
this
time
there
was
one
who
had
been
silently
watching
the
progress
of
affairs
at
aikwood
castle
where
he
had
long
been
accustomed
to
reckon
on
every
thing
as
his
own
but
now
there
were
some
things
passed
under
his
potent
eye
the
true
motives
for
which
he
could
not
comprehend
and
these
actions
were
still
growing
more
and
more
equivocal
so
he
resolved
on
trusting
his
sworn
vassals
no
more
to
their
own
guardianship
but
to
take
an
active
management
in
guiding
the
events
that
so
deeply
concerned
his
honour
and
power
who
this
august
personage
was
the
reader
will
scarcely
guess
he
may
perhaps
discover
it
in
the
detail
it
was
wearing
toward
evening
the
sun
being
either
set
or
hid
behind
dark
clouds
for
short
as
these
tales
may
appear
as
here
related
by
isaac
the
curate
they
had
taken
a
day
in
telling
by
the
wights
themselves
the
individuals
who
had
been
shut
up
were
all
light
of
heart
and
rejoicing
delany
had
fainted
in
ecstacy
or
partly
perhaps
by
exhaustion
but
was
soon
recovered
by
a
cup
of
cold
water
they
had
got
plenty
of
stores
laid
in
for
a
night
and
more
so
that
they
were
freed
from
the
dread
of
perishing
by
starvation
or
saving
their
lives
by
a
resource
of
all
others
the
most
repulsive
to
humanity
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
the
most
appalling
noise
was
heard
somewhere
about
the
castle
a
noise
which
neither
could
be
described
nor
the
cause
of
it
discovered
the
people
below
ran
out
to
the
court
or
to
the
tops
of
the
outer
walls
and
those
above
to
the
battlements
but
they
saw
nothing
save
the
troopers
horses
scowering
off
in
all
directions
every
one
of
them
snorting
aloud
and
cocking
their
heads
and
their
tails
tam
craik
and
dan
chisholm
were
still
standing
with
their
noses
close
to
the
iron
door
and
conversing
through
it
another
trooper
stood
close
at
dan
back
and
when
the
rushing
sound
arose
the
one
said
to
the
other
what
the
devil
is
that
take
care
wha
ye
speak
about
here
friend
or
wi
reverence
be
it
spoken
said
tam
then
turning
round
he
called
out
yardbire
what
is
that
i
can
not
tell
answered
charlie
only
i
think
the
devil
be
entered
into
the
horses
tam
who
did
not
hear
distinctly
from
the
top
answered
dan
thus
he
says
its
only
the
devil
entered
into
the
horses
dan
was
just
about
to
reply
when
the
trooper
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
in
a
whisper
hush
squire
good
lord
look
what
is
behind
us
he
looked
about
and
saw
a
terrific
being
standing
on
the
beckoning
him
to
come
down
from
an
irresistible
impulse
he
lost
no
time
in
obeying
and
pushing
the
trooper
down
before
him
he
descended
the
steps
when
he
came
to
the
bottom
he
got
a
full
view
of
the
figure
that
stood
upright
between
two
pilasters
with
its
face
straight
to
the
aperture
that
lighted
the
place
one
may
judge
of
our
yeomen
feelings
when
they
gazed
on
a
being
which
they
always
described
as
follows
it
appeared
about
double
the
human
size
both
in
might
and
proportion
its
whole
body
being
of
the
colour
of
bronze
as
well
as
the
crown
upon
its
head
the
skin
appeared
shrivelled
as
if
seared
with
fire
but
over
that
there
was
a
polish
that
glittered
and
shone
its
eyes
had
no
pupil
nor
circle
of
white
they
appeared
like
burning
lamps
deep
in
their
sockets
and
when
it
gazed
they
rolled
round
with
a
circular
motion
there
was
a
hairy
mantle
hung
down
and
covered
its
feet
that
they
could
not
be
seen
but
dan
saw
its
right
hand
as
it
pointed
to
them
to
retire
every
finger
of
which
terminated
in
a
long
crooked
talon
that
seemed
of
the
colour
of
molten
gold
it
once
opened
its
mouth
not
as
if
to
speak
but
to
breathe
and
as
it
stooped
forward
at
the
time
both
of
them
saw
it
within
it
had
neither
teeth
tongue
nor
throat
its
whole
inside
being
hollow
and
of
the
colour
of
burning
glass
it
pointed
with
its
right
hand
across
its
bosom
for
them
to
be
gone
and
as
they
passed
by
with
hurried
strides
it
drew
a
stroke
with
its
paw
which
threatened
to
send
them
heels
over
head
down
the
stair
but
it
withheld
the
blow
in
a
moment
as
if
moved
to
some
higher
revenge
and
all
the
way
down
the
great
winding
stair
it
followed
and
showered
on
them
such
a
torrent
of
burning
sulphur
that
they
were
almost
overwhelmed
all
the
while
vomiting
it
from
its
burning
bosom
with
a
noise
that
resembled
the
hissing
of
a
thousand
great
serpents
besides
this
on
every
there
were
a
pair
of
monsters
placed
as
guards
immense
snakes
bears
tigers
and
lions
all
with
eyes
like
burning
candles
for
all
these
our
two
yeomen
still
kept
their
feet
which
was
a
wonder
and
escaped
fairly
into
the
court
of
the
castle
when
they
arrived
there
every
one
of
their
companions
had
taken
and
were
running
as
if
for
death
or
life
and
after
what
our
two
champions
had
seen
there
was
no
occasion
to
bid
them
run
after
the
others
those
above
heard
only
the
rushing
noise
which
still
increased
as
long
as
there
was
one
of
those
below
within
the
gate
but
they
saw
nothing
further
and
wondered
not
a
little
when
they
saw
first
the
horses
run
away
and
then
the
men
after
them
when
charlie
saw
that
they
gone
and
his
dan
leaving
the
the
last
he
called
after
him
to
go
the
mill
and
see
that
corbie
got
plenty
of
what
our
prisoners
had
witnessed
was
like
every
thing
else
about
that
castle
quite
incomprehensible
even
the
great
master
himself
was
manifestly
at
a
loss
when
he
first
heard
the
sound
and
saw
the
beginning
of
the
confusion
his
eyes
beamed
with
exultation
he
gave
three
stamps
with
his
foot
and
called
aloud
as
to
some
invisible
being
in
an
unknown
tongue
but
on
receiving
no
answer
his
countenance
fell
and
he
looked
on
in
gloomy
mood
the
flyers
vanished
after
their
horses
on
the
hill
to
the
eastward
of
the
castle
once
a
few
of
them
rallied
and
faced
about
but
on
the
next
one
coming
up
they
betook
them
again
to
their
heels
and
thus
was
our
hapless
embassy
left
in
the
same
state
as
before
save
that
they
were
rather
in
higher
spirits
their
situation
being
now
known
and
instant
death
averted
after
they
had
refreshed
themselves
most
of
them
fell
into
a
slumber
but
at
length
as
the
evening
advanced
the
poet
claimed
his
privilege
of
telling
a
story
some
of
them
proposed
that
the
conversation
should
be
general
instead
seeing
the
great
stake
for
which
they
contended
was
now
in
all
likelihood
superseded
the
poet
however
was
of
a
different
opinion
on
the
ground
that
the
highest
stake
in
his
estimation
still
remained
what
though
my
life
may
not
be
forfeited
said
he
to
feed
the
hungry
and
carnivorous
maw
of
this
outrageous
baconist
although
my
warm
and
oozing
blood
may
not
be
sucked
up
like
the
stagnant
marsh
by
bittern
vile
or
by
the
tawney
snipe
yea
though
my
joints
should
not
be
skatched
and
collared
by
the
steel
or
sinews
gnawed
up
by
officious
grinder
what
that
to
me
a
gem
of
higher
worth
of
richer
acceptation
still
remains
beauty
unsullied
pure
simplicity
with
high
endowments
in
affliction
nursed
and
cramped
by
bondage
oh
my
very
heart
yearns
to
call
such
a
pearl
of
lustre
mine
a
kindred
soul
a
bosom
friend
a
oh
oh
oach
charlie
hasted
to
clap
his
hand
on
the
poet
mouth
as
he
burst
out
hout
hout
colly
said
he
i
am
quite
o
your
opinion
but
truly
this
is
carrying
the
joke
ower
far
i
wish
ye
maunna
hae
been
hauddin
rather
freely
to
your
head
o
thae
strong
liquors
for
the
singing
crew
are
a
drowthy
deils
ilk
ane
o
them
whisht
whisht
and
ye
sal
tell
your
tale
or
sing
your
sang
which
you
like
and
then
you
are
free
to
take
a
collop
or
gie
a
collop
wi
the
best
o
them
i
flatter
myself
that
rather
a
good
thing
eh
said
the
poet
what
thing
said
the
other
the
song
that
we
overheard
just
now
do
you
know
who
made
that
song
eh
not
i
but
you
have
heard
our
maidens
chaunt
it
have
you
not
god
bless
them
sweet
dear
sweet
sweet
creatures
why
sir
that
song
happens
to
be
mine
and
i
think
i
may
say
without
vanity
it
is
as
good
a
thing
of
the
kind
as
you
ever
heard
eh
faith
i
believe
it
is
said
charlie
not
knowing
well
what
to
say
for
he
had
heard
no
song
whatever
and
then
turning
to
the
rest
while
the
poet
was
enlarging
on
the
excellency
of
his
song
he
said
in
an
under
voice
gude
faith
the
poet
either
gaen
clean
daft
or
else
he
drunk
what
shall
i
say
to
him
the
poet
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
seeing
he
was
not
paying
attention
it
is
not
for
this
i
say
that
i
judge
the
piece
worthy
of
attention
nor
yet
what
it
shows
of
ability
hability
docility
or
any
of
the
terms
that
end
in
nor
for
its
allegory
category
or
any
of
the
terms
that
end
in
neither
is
it
for
its
versification
imagination
nor
any
of
the
thousand
abominable
terms
that
end
in
no
sir
the
properties
of
all
my
songs
i
am
thankful
to
saint
martin
end
in
and
you
know
the
song
yardbire
o
yes
quite
weel
what
do
you
think
of
the
eleventh
verse
let
me
see
no
it
is
the
thirteenth
verse
good
friday
are
there
so
many
hem
m
the
tenth
is
the
i
am
sure
of
that
the
eleventh
is
the
the
twelfth
the
cloudberry
and
the
shepherd
boy
the
thirteenth
is
the
gander
and
it
is
the
fourteenth
what
do
you
think
of
the
fourteenth
ay
it
is
the
gowans
and
the
laverock
that
you
will
like
best
you
remember
that
i
am
sure
o
yes
to
be
sure
i
do
aside
good
lord
the
poet
horn
mad
heard
ever
any
body
the
like
o
this
how
is
this
it
runs
ay
when
the
bluart
bears
a
pearl
and
the
daisy
turns
a
pea
and
the
bonny
lucken
gowan
has
fauldit
up
his
ee
then
the
laverock
frae
the
blue
lift
doops
down
and
thinks
nae
shame
to
woo
his
bonny
lassie
when
the
kye
come
hame
the
song
is
good
and
the
music
of
the
song
also
is
delectable
said
the
friar
but
the
voice
of
the
singer
is
like
a
sweet
psaltery
that
hath
lost
a
string
and
hath
its
belly
rent
by
the
staff
of
the
beater
lo
i
would
even
delight
to
hear
the
song
from
beginning
to
end
sing
it
poet
and
let
it
stand
for
the
tale
cried
two
of
them
at
once
that
i
will
not
answered
he
i
will
tell
my
tale
in
my
own
style
and
my
own
manner
as
the
rest
have
done
nevertheless
if
my
throat
were
not
so
dry
i
would
sing
the
song
it
is
plain
what
he
wants
said
charlie
is
the
gate
wi
a
the
minstrels
the
whistle
or
want
the
charlie
handed
him
another
cup
of
strong
drink
desiring
him
to
take
it
off
and
sing
he
did
the
first
freely
and
attempted
the
second
with
equal
alacrity
but
his
voice
and
memory
both
failed
him
by
the
way
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
whole
party
even
the
captive
boy
screamed
with
laughter
and
the
great
master
was
twice
constrained
to
smile
but
we
must
describe
this
scene
as
isaac
himself
gives
it
the
poet
was
sitting
on
a
bench
with
charlie
on
the
one
hand
and
delany
on
the
other
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
and
clasping
his
hands
which
he
heaved
up
at
every
turn
of
the
tune
he
went
on
thus
the
sweetest
thing
the
best
thing
verse
first
come
tell
me
a
you
shepherds
that
love
the
tarry
woo
and
tell
me
a
you
jolly
boys
that
whistle
at
the
plow
what
is
the
greatest
bliss
that
the
tongue
of
man
can
name
is
to
woo
a
bonny
lassie
when
the
kye
come
hame
when
the
kye
come
hame
when
the
kye
come
hame
the
gloaming
and
the
mirk
when
the
kye
come
hame
that
the
burden
or
the
quoir
as
father
cormack
calls
it
the
like
verse
second
is
not
beneath
the
burgonet
nor
yet
beneath
the
crown
is
not
on
couch
of
velvet
nor
yet
in

is
beneath
the
spreading
birch
in
the

without
the

wi
a
bonny

verse
third
there
the
blackbird
bigs
his
nest
for
the
mate
he
to
see
and
on
the
topmost
bough
oh
a
happy
bird
is
he
there
he
pours
his
melting
ditty
and
love
is
a
the
theme
and
he
woo
his
bonny

when

when

can
hardly
frame

a
bonny
bonny
lassie
when
the

when

verse
fifth
then
the
eye
shines
sae
bright
the
hale
soul
to
beguile
there
love
in
every
whisper
and
joy
in
every

perils
and
its
fame
and
miss
a
bonny
lassie
when
the
kye
come
hame
when
the
kye
come

here
the
poet
warred
a
long
time
with
recollection
always
repeating
i
made
the
thing
and
it
is
impossible
i
can
forget
it
i
comprehend
at
length
he
sung
the
following
verse
which
he
said
was
the
fifteenth
verse
the
fifteenth
see
yonder
pawky
shepherd
that
lingers
on
the
hill
his
ewes
are
in
the
fauld
and
his
lambs
are
lying
still
yet
he
downa
gang
to
bed
for
his
heart
is
in
a
flame
to
meet
his
bonnie
lassie
when
the
kye
come
hame
when
the
kye
come
hame
verse
sixteenth
and
last
away
wi
fame
and
fortune
what
comfort
can
they
gie
and
a
the
arts
that
prey
on
man
life
and
libertye
gie
me
the
highest
joy
that
the
heart
of
man
can
frame
my
bonny
bonny
lassie
when
the
kye
come

when
the

when
the
kye
come
hame
the
gloaming
and
the
mirk
when
the
kye
come
hame
i
made
the
thing
added
the
poet
but
god
knows
how
i
have
forgot
it
since
i
came
to
the
top
of
this
cursed
tower
the
wind
has
blown
it
out
of
my
head
with
these
words
he
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
which
they
suffered
him
to
enjoy
before
he
began
his
competition
in
the
meantime
isaac
relates
an
extraordinary
story
of
a
certain
consultation
that
took
place
in
the
castle
in
that
very
interim
but
does
not
say
on
what
authority
he
had
it
none
of
the
parties
yet
named
having
apparently
heard
it
the
castle
of
aikwood
says
he
being
left
as
before
an
ample
and
perilous
void
some
old
and
frequent
inmates
took
undisputed
possession
the
leader
and
convoker
of
this
gang
was
no
other
than
the
master
fiend
who
ordered
our
yeomen
out
of
the
castle
and
chased
them
forth
with
so
little
ceremony
in
the
great
master
study
was
his
gigantic
and
commanding
frame
placed
at
the
end
of
the
board
while
the
three
pages
prig
prim
and
pricker
were
waiting
his
beck
come
nigh
me
my
friends
said
he
and
read
me
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
king
of
mighty
conjurors
now
what
thou
willest
our
lord
and
master
was
the
reply
give
the
command
with
the
power
and
thy
pleasure
shall
be
done
how
canst
thou
answer
for
thy
negligence
in
suffering
this
cowled
and
canting
vagabond
to
gain
admittance
here
with
his
saws
and
parables
his
crosiers
and
his
writings
we
meant
to
devour
him
but
our
power
extended
not
to
it
thou
hast
seen
the
bones
of
one
whom
we
suspected
you
are
indolent
and
wayward
slaves
either
separate
our
greatest
vassal
on
earth
from
this
captious
professor
or
you
shall
be
punished
with
many
stripes
our
sway
is
dishonoured
if
such
a
man
as
he
is
suffered
to
take
shelter
under
a
crosier
and
there
hold
our
power
at
bay
our
control
at
defiance
return
to
him
that
power
which
since
his
dejection
has
been
withdrawn
and
you
are
sure
of
him
still
riches
and
honours
he
despises
feasting
and
he
abhors
but
for
power
to
do
what
no
other
man
can
perform
he
would
sell
twenty
souls
were
they
in
his
power
of
disposal
he
is
a
great
man
and
well
suited
for
our
free
independent
government
by
his
principle
of
insubordination
to
established
authorities
i
yet
hope
to
bring
all
mankind
to
my
own
mind
and
my
own
country
read
me
my
riddle
you
three
slaves
what
is
the
most
hateful
thing
in
nature
a
saint
more
ready
than
right
and
more
right
than
ingenious
show
cause
because
he
is
the
greatest
coward
and
all
that
he
does
springs
from
the
detestable
passion
of
terror
right
which
being
is
the
most
noble
the
opposer
of
all
established
authorities
ordained
by
the
tyrant
of
the
universe
right
right
these
are
the
men
for
me
and
of
these
this
master
was
a
great
ensample
therefore
separate
separate
separate
my
elemental
power
is
solemnly
engaged
but
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
it
shall
be
given
to
you
to
work
again
at
your
master
will
till
that
time
it
will
be
as
well
to
prevent
all
ingress
and
egress
here
and
at
that
time
i
will
come
again
speed
you
well
nimble
noddies
shape
well
and
shard
well
and
the
day
is
your
own
while
i
transform
my
shape
sing
me
the
song
that
i
love
whenever
i
hear
it
my
furtherance
is
the
better
the
imps
complied
and
the
redoubted
fiend
laughed
till
the
walls
of
the
castle
shook
while
those
on
the
top
took
it
for
the
great
bittern
of
the
hartwood
called
there
the

and
of
weeping

the
vision

brood
on
princedoms

our
prisoners
on
the
top
of

perceived
a
large
rough
jogging
out
at
the
gate
of
the
castle

following
in
the
direction
of
the
fugitives
when
the
brute
saw

he
was
perceived
he
turned
round
set
up
his
snout
toward
the
battlements
and
uttered
a
loud
which
when
the
great
master
heard
he
started
to
his
feet
and
with
wild
staring
looks
and
his
hair
standing
on
end
took
shelter
behind
the
friar
behold
thou
and
see
with
thine
eyes
that
it
is
only
a
come
from
the
camp
of
our
captain
said
the
friar
lo
thy
very
nature
is
changed
since
first
i
saw
thee
then
would
to
the
gods
that
i
had
never
seen
thee
or
that
i
had
seen
thee
sooner
said
the
master
and
strode
away
to
discourage
any
farther
reply
the
dog
followed
the
fugitives
and
bent
his
course
toward
the
mill
that
being
the
next
inhabited
house
to
the
eastward
dan
chisholm
and
his
yeomen
landed
all
there
and
in
full
assembly
he
related
to
their
terror
and
astonishment
how
he
had
seen
the
devil
himself
and
several
of
his
monstrous
agents
who
had
chased
him
from
the
castle
spuing
fire
and
brimstone
on
him
like
a
cataract
the
rest
said
that
though
they
had
not
seen
the
devil
they
had
seen
and
heard
enough
to
put
any
rational
being
out
of
his
senses
and
as
much
as
to
teach
them
never
to
go
there
again
dan
swore
that
they
were
not
to
be
taught
any
such
thing
for
said
he
our
captain
friends
and
our
own
brethren
in
arms
are
most
unwarrantably
and
i
must
also
say
unaccountably
confined
there
and
we
will
either
free
them
or
perish
in
the
attempt
i
can
find
plenty
of
holy
men
that
with
book
and
candle
can
withstand
the
devil
and
shall
make
him
flee
from
his
stronghold
like
fire
from
the
flint
if
i
had
the
gospel
friar
on
the
one
side
of
him
and
father
brand
or
capuchin
cairnabie
on
the
other
i
shall
gar
him
skip
while
dan
was
in
the
middle
of
this
speech
in
comes
the
great
rough
who
after
fawning
on
some
of
the
warriors
as
on
old
acquaintances
took
his
station
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
thronged
hall
and
began
a
licking
his
feet
but
at
the
same
time
taking
good
heed
to
all
that
passed
it
was
finally
agreed
that
dan
and
a
companion
should
ride
straight
to
melrose
and
represent
their
case
to
the
holy
abbot
there
who
was
devoted
to
the
interests
of
their
captain
and
who
it
was
not
doubted
would
devise
means
of
expelling
the
old
demon
from
his
guardship
and
letting
free
their
friends
who
were
all
baptised
men
and
good
christians
as
they
formed
these
sapient
devices
many
hard
things
were
said
of
the
devil
and
our
warriors
seemed
rather
inclined
to
make
a
of
him
till
the
miller
maid
interrupted
them
with
the
following
question
wha
o
you
trooper
chaps
does
this
maskis
dog
belang
to
to
nane
o
us
was
answered
by
several
at
the
same
time
i
wish
ye
wad
tent
him
then
said
she
for
this
wee
while
bygane
his
een
hae
been
glentin
like
twa
blue
burnin
candles
i
wish
he
be
nae
a
mad
ane
sneck
doors
and
out
swords
cried
the
miller
we
hae
him
proven
the
doors
were
shut
and
the
yeomen
surrounded
the
dog
with
their
drawn
weapons
the
poor
beast
lay
as
as
a
lamb
with
his
head
upon
his
fore
feet
so
as
to
hide
them
turning
up
his
eyes
from
below
his
shaggy
brows
in
a
beseeching
manner
and
wagging
his
tail
till
it
played
thump
thump
on
the
floor
but
this
did
not
hinder
the
miller
from
reconnoitring
though
it
gave
him
rather
a
favourable
opinion
of
his
shaggy
guest
poor
fellow
said
the
miller
dog
may
ye
be
the
dog
forgot
himself
he
lifted
up
his
head
in
a
kind
acknowledging
manner
to
the
miller
who
looking
narrowly
at
him
cried
out
a
marvel
a
marvel
saw
ever
ony
mortal
man
the
like
this
here
a
tyke
wi
cloven
cloots
like
a
gait
fairney
cloots
and
a
thegither
the
holy
virgin
be
wi
us
i
believe
we
hae
gotten
the
here
the
miller
was
interrupted
without
getting
the
sentence
concluded
the
dog
sprung
to
his
feet
appearing
twice
as
big
as
when
he
entered
roared
he
in
the
miller
face
with
the
voice
of
an
enraged
lion
and
as
he
bayed
from
side
to
side
on
the
warrior
circle
they
all
retreated
backward
till
the
wall
stopped
them
well
might
they
for
they
perceived
by
his
open
mouth
the
same
appearance
that
dan
had
before
witnessed
namely
a
stomach
and
chest
of
burning
flame
reiterated
he
youph
youph
youph
all
fled
back
aghast
but
the
attack
was
of
short
duration
the
miller
had
a
huge
fire
of
seeds
above
a
burning
log
of
wood
which
he
had
heaped
on
for
the
comfort
of
his
guests
when
the
dog
reached
that
he
broke
into
it
appearing
to
bury
himself
in
the
coil
of
fiery
dust
it
flashed
upwards
in
millions
of
burning
atoms
and
in
the
midst
of
them
up
flew
the
dog
out
at
the
top
of
the
lum
with
a
tremendous
all
was
silence
for
a
few
seconds
while
our
yeomen
stood
in
a
circle
with
their
weapons
drawn
and
their
backs
at
the
wall
gaping
with
affright
and
staring
on
one
another
by
saint
thomas
we
are
haunted
cried
dan
breaking
silence
that
is
the
same
chap
i
forgathered
wi
afore
in
the
staircase
of
the
castle
i
ken
him
by
his
lowin
lungs
though
he
has
changed
his
shape
he
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
laugh
on
the
top
of
the
house
and
a
voice
that
said
in
a
jeering
tone
ha
ha
ha
andrew
chisholm
is
that
you
i
have
found
out
a
your
plans
and

in

men
dan
could
not
contain
his
indignation
on
hearing
this
brag
he
ran
forward
to
the
brace
put
his
neck
under
it
and
turning
his
nose
up
the
lum
or
rustic
chimney
answered
deil
o
that
ye
fit
to
do

but

what

ye
here
amang
leel
men
weel
answered
and
like
yoursel
dan
said
one
of
the
yeomen
and
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
which
rousing
his
spirit
still
farther
he
added
confound
you
robin
geordie
o
what
for
didna
ye
strike
when
the
foul
thief
set
up
his
gousty
gab
at
your
nose
wi
his
impudent
i
see
nae
right
ony
o
god
creatures
hae
to
be
hurlbarrowed
out
o
their
standing
wi
him
as
he
finished
the
remark
there
was
something
came
to
the
door
and
gave
two
or
three
rude
impatient
scratches
exactly
in
the
same
manner
that
a
strong
dog
does
that
wants
to
be
in
this
instantly
changed
the
cheer
of
our
sturdy
group
that
with
one
involuntary
movement
closed
round
the
hearth
as
the
point
the
most
distant
from
the
door
that
him
again
said
the
miller
lass
the
lord
forbid
said
the
miller
i
wonder
what
multure
he
wants
frae
me
though
i
live
on
the
lands
of
a
master
of
arts
i
had
nae
inkling
that
i
was
thirl
to
hell
brave
lads
can
nane
of
you
rhame
a
mass
a
credo
or
a
paternoster
he
is
but
a
coward
at
best
i
hae
kend
a
monk
wi
his
crosier
and
his
cowl
chace
him
like
a
rabbit
i
fear
we
prove
but
lame
hands
at
that
said
dan
and
think
we
had
better
sally
out
on
him
sword
in
hand
and
see
what
he
can
either
say
or
do
for
himself
but
chryste
i
needna
say
that
considering
that
i
ken
sae
weel
what
his
lining
made
of
i
hae
a
cross
and
chain
in
the
house
said
the
miller
that
was
consecrated
at
the
shrine
of
st
bothan
whoever
will
be
our
leader
shall
bear
that
before
him
and
we
bang
the
auld
thief
away
frae
our
bigging
the
scratching
was
renewed
with
redoubled
fury
our
yeomen
crowded
closer
around
the
fire
till
all
at
once
their
ears
were
saluted
by
a
furious
down
the
lum
which
in
spite
of
their
utmost
resolution
scattered
them
like
a
covey
of
over
which
the
hawk
is
hovering
when
every
one
endeavours
to
shift
for
itself
and
hide
in
its
own
heather
bush
their
faces
were
by
this
time
flushed
with
shame
as
well
as
fear
that
they
should
be
thus
cuffed
about
by
the
auld
thief
as
they
styled
him
resolved
therefore
to
make
one
great
and
strenuous
effort
the
miller
brought
out
his
consecrated
cross
some
tied
sticks
and
others
horn
spoons
across
till
all
were
armed
with
the
same
irresistible
symbol
and
then
they
marshalled
up
before
the
fire
uncovered
their
heads
and
with
the
ensigns
reared
before
them
waited
for
a
moment
the
word
of
command
to
march
out
to
the
grand
attack
the
arch
fiend
not
choosing
to
wait
the
issue
raised
such
a
horse
laugh
on
the
top
of
the
lum
that
their
ears
were
deafened
with
the
noise
and
clapping
his
paws
that
sounded
like
the
strokes
of
battering
ram
horns
he
laughed
till
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
chattered
against
each
other
and
away
he
bounded
through
the
clouds
of
the
night
apparently
in
an
agony
of
laughter
aha
there
he
goes
said
dan
there
nae
guidance
to
be
had
him
and
as
little
mense
in
meddling
wi
him
ay
let
him
gang
said
the
miller
he
the
warst
mouse
o
the
mill
ane
had
better
tine
the
blind
bitch
litter
than
hae
the
mill
singed
wi
brimstone
i
lurd
rather
deal
wi
the
thankless
maltster
that
neither
coup
neivefu
nor
lippie
than
wi
him
i
have
no
part
of
the
breviary
but
a
glorious
preamble
kneel
till
i
repeat
it
the
troopers
kneeled
round
the
miller
who
lifting
up
his
hands
said
with
great
fervour
o
semper
timidum
scelus
obstupui
steteruntque
comæ
et
vox
faucibus
hæsit
o
deus
nusquam
tuta
fides
amen
amen
repeated
all
the
group
and
arose
greatly
strengthened
and
encouraged
by
the
miller
they
spent
that
night
around
the
miller
hearth
and
had
a
cog
of
good
brose
to
their
supper
the
next
morning
dan
and
two
associates
rode
off
for
melrose
to
lay
their
case
before
the
friendly
abbot
and
to
beg
assistance
which
notwithstanding
the
devil
brag
they
were
not
afraid
of
obtaining
but
the
important
events
that
followed
must
be
related
in
course
while
we
return
to
those
friends
in
their
elevated
confinement
to
whom
that
night
the
poet
related
the
following
tale
chapter
ii
did
you
not
wake
them
cornaro
alas
my
lord
i
could
not
their
slumber
was
so
deep
it
seemed
to
me
a
sleep
eternal
not
a
sleep
of
death
but
of
extatic
silence
such
a
beam
of
joy
and
happiness
i
beheld
shed
from
the
human
face
prioress
a
the
poet
tale
fain
would
i
tell
my
friends
and
of
my
translation
hence
of
all
the
joys
and
ecstacies
of
that
celestial
clime
ycleped
the
land
of
faery
were
it
not
that
one
is
here
whose
sex
forbids
it
and
whose
gentle
nature
from
such
a
tale
would
shrink
as
doth
the
flower
before
the
nipping
gale
you
all
have
heard
of
that
celestial
form
the
white
lady
and
of
that
wan
and
beatific
presence
there
lives
in
my
remembrance
some
faint
image
of
saintly
beauty
but
list
to
me
my
friends
and
do
not
smile
far
less
break
forth
with
loud
uncourteous
neigh
like
war
horse
in
the
charge
vile
waste
of
breath
convulsive
unrestrained
but
hear
the
truth
was
not
she
who
bore
me
from
this
not
she
white
as
all
divined
no
it
was
a
form
of
flesh
and
that
flesh
too
of
most
rare
quality
fair
witching
plump
rosy
and
amorous
and
of
unmarred
proportions
sooth
she
who
lured
me
from
my
rustic
home
no
other
was
than
wandering
minstreless
queen
to
the
mightiest
harper
ever
born
sole
empress
of
a
tuneful
wayward
choir
thoughtless
and
giddy
but
their
music
stole
my
very
soul
away
what
could
i
do
but
follow
it
to
listen
and
to
sing
in
that
bright
train
i
sought
the
scottish
court
the
nobles
hall
and
every
motely
scene
of
loud
festivity
throughout
the
land
there
have
i
heard
and
seen
such
scenes
of
love
of
dalliance
and
of
mirth
of
deep
intrigue
and
violent
cruelty
as
eye
of
minstrel
hath
not
witnessed
yes
i
have
seen
things
not
to
be
expressed
at
least
not
here
therefore
i
change
the
rule
this
night
pursued
of
saying
what
myself
have
seen
and
done
the
fairy
land
in
which
i
sojourned
was
fair
caledon
and
there
i
had
my
living
minstrel
joys
in
high
abundance
but
i
grieve
to
say
a
fatal
brawl
placed
all
of
us
within
the
line
to
which
the
sword
of
vengeance
extends
its
dreadful
sway
our
group
dispersed
the
soul
of
melody
was
then
no
more
the
sounds
of
harmony
divine
were
hushed
all
scattered
on
the
winds
of
other
lands
and
other
climes
to
charm
with
wailing
numbers
southward
i
came
amid
the
border
clans
to
trust
my
life
men
lawless
as
myself
they
once
had
saved
me
when
a
helpless
orphan
whom
could
i
better
trust
and
i
have
found
their
generosity
alone
by
their
own
courage
for
my
adventures
let
this
sketch
suffice
and
though
not
of
the
fairyland
i
will
relate
a
tale
as
pure
as
wonderful
and
full
of
mystery
as
if
in
other
worlds
i
learned
it
i
had
it
from
a
simple
peasant
mouth
an
old
grey
hind
upon
the
sidley
hills
who
vouched
its
truth
with
faltering
tongue
and
palpitating
heart
for
love
for
life
and
all
the
soul
holds
dear
i
say
my
tale
o
be
my
soul
rapt
to
the
estimate
at
which
i
hold
the
prize
and
the
divine
and
holy
narrative
once
on
a
time
in
that
sweet
northern
land
called
otholine
the
heathen
hongar
landed
and
city
and
dale
the
rampart
and
the
flood
in
vain
withstood
his
might
even
to
the
base
of
the
unconquered
grampians
did
he
wend
with
fire
and
sword
and
all
who
would
not
kneel
and
sacrifice
to
his
strange
northern
gods
he
tortured
to
the
death
some
few
renounced
the
cross
for
sordid
life
and
dread
of
unheard
torments
men
were
roasted
matrons
impaled
and
pure
virginity
was
given
up
to
the
rude
soldiery
to
be
abused
or
humbled
as
they
termed
it
then
were
they
decked
with
flowers
and
ornaments
led
forth
in
pairs
unto
the
horrid
shrine
and
sacrificed
to
odin
at
that
time
there
lived
three
beauteous
sisters
of
the
line
of
mighty
kings
they
were
so
passing
fair
that
all
who
saw
them
wondered
and
all
who
wondered
loved
hongar
and
hubba
these
two
heathen
brothers
and
princes
of
the
danes
heard
of
their
fame
their
beauty
and
their
excellencies
of
nature
and
sent
to
seize
them
in
their
tower
that
in
the
heights
of
stormonth
stood
secure
the
castle
was
surprised
the
virgins
seized
and
carried
to
the
camp
there
to
their
dreadful
trial
were
they
brought
and
bid
to
curse
the
sacred
name
they
feared
and
worshipped
to
renounce
the
holy
cross
and
worship
odin
or
give
up
their
bodies
to
shame
to
ignominy
and
to
death
on
odin
hideous
altar
marley
and
morna
both
kneeled
and
intreated
begged
a
little
time
to
ponder
on
the
dread
alternative
but
the
young
sprightly
lena
fairest
she
of
albyn
virgins
browed
the
threat
with
dauntless
eye
that
eye
whose
liquid
smile
in
love
sweet
converse
had
been
formed
to
beam
thou
savage
heathen
cried
she
dost
thou
think
to

who
must
yield
in
prison
dark
the
virgins
were
immured
with
sevenfold
gates
and
sevenfold
bars
shut
in
soon
as
they
were
alone
the
sisters
twain
marley
and
morna
in
fond
tears
embraced
their
youngest
sister
lauded
her
high
soul
and
vowed
with
her
to
stand
with
her
to
die
unsullied
in
the
faith
they
had
been
taught
then
did
they
kneel
on
the
cold
dungeon
floor
and
one
by
one
offered
their
fervent
prayers
at
mercy
footstool
but
chiefly
were
their
vows
made
to
the
holy
virgin
for
they
hoped
that
she
would
save
their
pure
virginity
from
sin
pollution
never
did
prayers
ascend
up
to
heaven
with
greater
fervency
and
as
the
hour
of
midnight
on
them
drew
they
kneeled
and
side
by
side
with
lifted
hands
and
eyes
turned
toward
heaven
sang
aloud
this
holy
simple
hymn
to
their
redeemer

thou
who
the
star
of
the
east
yet
helpless
lay
at
a
virgin
breast
slept
in
the
manger
and
cried
on

glowing
sphere

but
lord
of
glory
we
know
not
thee
we
know
not

we
say
we
can
not
from
thy
presence
be
nor
from
thine
eye
away
for
though
on
the
right
hand
of
god
thou
art
here
in
this
dark
and
drear
abode
beyond
the
moon
and
the
starry
way
thou
holdest
thy
almighty
sway
where
spirits
in
floods
of
light
are
swimming
and
angels
round
thy
throne
are
hymning
yet
present
with
all
who
call
on
thee
in
this
world
of
wo
and
adversity
then
o
thou
son
of
the
virgin
hear
us
god
of
love
and
of
life
be
near
us
our
hour
of
trial
is
at
hand
and
without
thy
aid
how
shall
we
stand
our
stains
wash
out
our
sins
forgive
and
before
thee
may
our
spirits
live
for
thee
and
thy
truth
be
our
bosoms
steeled
o
be
our
help
our
stay
our
shield
show
thy
dread
power
for
mercy
sake
for
thy
name
and
thy
glory
and
all
is
at
stake
bow
down
thy
heavens
and
rend
them
asunder
and
come
in
the
cloud
in
the
flame
or
the
thunder
the
trumpets
now
were
sounding
while
the
host
arose
from
wine
and
wassail
to
prepare
the
baleful
sacrifice
of
christian
souls
the
virgins
heard
and
trembled
as
they
kneeled
and
beauteous
lena
raised
her
slender
hands
and
prayed
with
many
tears
that
the
almighty
would
stretch
out
his
right
hand
and
close
their
eyes
in
everlasting
sleep
to
save
them
from
or
the
fate
they
dreaded
more
while
yet
the
words
were
but
in
utterance
and
ere
the
vow
was
vowed
they
heard
the
gates
unbarred
one
after
one
and
saw
the
lights
glance
through
the
lurid
gloom
each
youthful
heart
turned
as
it
were
to
stone
for
well
they
weened
the
danish
soldiers
came
to
bring
them
forth
to
shame
and
death
they
kept
their
humble
posture
with
hands
and
eyes
upraised
for
they
expected
no
pity
or
compassion
save
from
heaven
the
inmost
door
upon
its
hinges
turned
like
thunder
out
of
tune
and
lo
there
entered
no
heathen
soldier
but
a
radiant
form
covered
with
light
as
with
a
flowing
robe
in
his
right
hand
he
bore
a
golden
rod
and
in
his
left
a
lamp
that
shone
as
bright
as
the
sun
a
thousand
thousand
gems
from
off
his
raiment
cast
their
dazzling
lustre
diamonds
and
rubies
formed
alternate
stars
while
all
between
was
rayed
and
spangled
with
brightness
round
his
head
he
wore
a
wreath
of
emeralds
these
were
set
with
green
they
deemed
he
was
the
great
high
priest
of
odin
come
to
lead
them
to
the
sacrifice
but
yet
his
look
so
mild
and
so
benign
raised
half
a
hope
within
their
breasts
of
pity
and
regard
they
were
about
to
plead
but
ere
a
sound
breathed
from
their
lips
the
stranger
beckoned
them
to
silence
then
in
mild
and
courteous
strain
in
their
own
tongue
he
thus
accosted
them
to
one
already
have
your
vows
been
framed
and
would
you
bow
to
another
you
have
pleaded
to
heaven
high
king
and
would
you
plead
to
man
rise
up
and
follow
me
the
virgins
rose
they
had
not
power
to
stay
and
followed
him
alas
they
knew
not
whither
they
had
no
voice
to
question
or
complain
door
after
door
they
passed
gate
after
gate
and
still
their
guide
touching
them
with
his
golden
rod
they
closed
in
jangling
fury
onward
still
they
moved
and
met
the
heathen
bands
led
by
their
chiefs
hongar
and
hubba
they
were
drunk
with
wine
and
loudly
did
they
halloo
when
they
saw
their
prey
escaped
and
walking
on
the
street
all
beauteous
and
serene
closing
around
the
fugitives
and
jabbering
uncouth
terms
and
words
obscene
the
chiefs
opened
their
arms
to
seize
the
helpless
three
just
then
their
guide
turned
round
unmoved
and
waving
his
bright
rod
the
heathens
staggered
uttered
mumbling
sounds
and
trying
vainly
to
support
themselves
reeling
they
sunk
enfeebled
to
the
earth
where
all
as
still
and
motionless
they
lay
as
piles
of
lifeless
corpses
how
the
virgins
wondered
at
what
they
saw
and
fearless
now
they
followed
their
bright
leader
next
they
met
the
priests
of
odin
in
their
wild
attire
marching
in
grand
procession
to
the
scene
of
mighty
sacrifice
aloft
they
bore
their
hideous
giant
idol
by
his
sides
his
loathsome
consort
and
his
monster
son
freya
and
thor
while
all
their
followers
sung

and

strains

the
god
of

danes
the
maids
and
their
angelic
guide
went
on
following
the
cross
and
as
they
went
they
sung
in
sweet
and
humble
aspirations
the
song
of
the
lamb
they
met
the
gorgeous
files
fair
met
with
fair
the
hideous
idols
sat
an
hundred
cubits
high
whereas
the
cross
a
maiden
hand
upbore
but
when
they
met
the
proud
and
mighty
peal
swelling
from
odin
worshippers
was
hushed
as
with
a
sob
the
hills
rang
with
the
sound
and
the
air
bore
the
last
knell
up
to
the
skies
it
quavered
through
the
spheres
and
died
in
distance
to
be
heard
no
more
while
nought
but
the
sweet
notes
the
virgins
sung
rose
on
the
paths
of
night
the
motely
mass
of
heathens
stood
amazed
and
as
they
stood
they
listened
and
they
quaked
the
words
were
these
at
which
they
paused
and
which
the
virgins
sung
silence
the
blasphemers
thee
that
defy
strike
down
the
mighty
son
of
the
most
high
rise
in
thy
power
that
the
heathen
may
see
what
dust
are
their
gods
and
their
glory
to
thee
raise
thy
right
hand
and
in
pieces
them
shiver
that
to
the
true
god
may
the
praise
be
for
ever
at
every
line
the
bearers
and
their
gods
trembled
the
more
and
as
the
last
notes
closed
the
mighty
odin
toppled
from
his
throne
and
crashed
amid
his
powerless
worshippers
his
wooden
spouse
and
son
fell
with
the
sire
of
gods
and
men
and
in
a
thousand
pieces
their
gilded
frames
were
dashed
confusion
reigned
the
host
fled
in
dismay
but
odin
priests
sunk
down
in
low
prostration
groaning
and
howling
for
the
fall
of
odin
the
shield
and
glory
of
the
danish
host
from
out
this
wild
confusion
the
bright
guide
conducted
the
three
virgins
to
a
cave
close
by
the
river
brink
and
charged
them
hide
until
the
wrath
of
the
enraged
foe
should
be
abated
here
said
he
you
are
in
perfect
safety
no
one
living
knows
of
this
retreat
here
sleep
and
take
your
rest
may
angels
watch
around
your
flinty
couch
farewell
i
must
begone
on
the
employ
assigned
me
by
your
father
and
by
mine
he
left
the
lamp
and
went
his
way
forthwith
they
kneeled
in
prayer
thanking
their
saviour
for
their
great
deliverance
then
laid
them
down
to
rest
they
kissed
the
cross
and
folded
closely
in
each
other
arms
cheek
leaning
unto
cheek
with
holy
hymns
they
sung
themselves
asleep
great
was
the
rage
among
the
danish
chiefs
and
wide
the
search
for
these
presumptuous
and
bold
aggressors
the
host
was
all
discouraged
and
amazed
and
nought
but
terror
reigned
earldoms
were
offered
for
the
audacious
maids
dead
or
alive
but
nor
alive
nor
dead
could
they
be
found
either
by
friend
or
foe
o
dreadful
were
the
execrations
uttered
by
the
danes
they
called
them
demons
witches
and
the
worst
of
all
incendiaries
well
they
might
the
terror
of
their
arms
was
broken
great
was
the
rejoicing
mid
the
hills
and
glens
of
albyn
but
the
eastern
vallies
groaned
beneath
the
fury
of
the
savage
dane
and
christian
blood
was
shed
on
every
cross
the
virgins
waked
at
morn
and
still
the
lamp
sent
forth
its
feeble
glimmer
through
the
cave
the
through
the
crevice
of
the
rock
streamed
in
and
mixed
with
it
the
virgins
strove
to
rise
to
speak
to
sing
a
morning
hymn
but
all
their
limbs
were
cold
and
their
tongues
clove
fast
to
their
thirsty
palates
lena
first
of
all
the
three
upraised
her
pallid
form
and
on
the
lamp
turning
her
drowsy
eye
there
did
it
settle
closed
and
oped
again
but
still
with
faded
and
uncertain
light
as
if
the
mind
were
lacking
long
she
sat
half
raised
in
this
uneasy
torpid
state
this
struggle
oblivion
and
life
oft
she
assayed
her
sisters
to
awake
by
naming
them
but
still
as
oft
the
names
died
in
a
whisper
by
degrees
her
mind
dawned
into
recollection
as
the
moon
breaks
the
sullen
twilight
then
the
wonders
that
she
had
seen
aroused
her
soul
to
all
its
wonted
energy
she
kneeled
and
thanked
her
maker
for
the
great
deliverance
to
them
vouchsafed
and
when
her
sisters
woke
they
woke
to
join
her
in
a
heavenly
song
what
ails
our
sister
here
we
are
in
safety
why
does
our
dear
beloved
not
rest
in
peace
the
night
is
not
far
spent
the
dawn
of
morn
is
yet
far
distant
o
dear
lena
sleep
sleep
on
and
take
your
rest
the
morning
sun
is
yet
beneath
the
deep
our
limbs
are
cold
our
eyes
are
heavy
yet
we
can
not
rise
for
we
are
weary
and
not
half
awake
wake
my
beloved
sisters
it
is
time
the
noon
is
at
its
height
see
how
the
sun
peeps
through
the
granite
cliffs
and
on
the
stream
sheds
ray
of
trembling
silver
let
us
rise
and
talk
of
all
the
wonders
we
have
seen
long
they
conversed
in
tears
of
gratitude
still
peeping
from
their
cavern
lest
the
dane
again
should
find
and
drag
them
to
the
altar
sore
were
they
pressed
by
hunger
from
the
stream
they
drank
abundantly
with
thankful
hearts
but
food
for
many
a
day
and
many
a
night
they
scarce
had
tasted
and
they
longed
for
it
with
more
than
ordinary
longing
night
approached
and
there
they
sat
not
knowing
what
to
do
a
prey
to
gnawing
hunger
at
the
last
young
lena
said
i
can
not
ween
that
heaven
hath
wrought
a
miracle
for
our
relief
and
for
no
higher
purpose
than
that
we
should
be
left
to
die
of
hunger
in
this
dark
and
hideous
den
again
i
put
my
life
into
its
hand
and
go
into
the
city
after
twilight
in
search
of
bread
and
if
i
die
i
die
heaven
will
be
done
her
sisters
looked
at
her
and
blessed
her
in
the
holy
virgin
name
they
could
not
bid
her
go
where
danger
waited
so
great
so
imminent
and
yet
they
felt
they
could
not
press
her
stay
with
cautious
eye
and
with
enfeebled
step
trembling
she
sought
the
city
gate
but
when
afar
she
saw
by
porters
striding
to
and
fro
with
glittering
lances
of
enormous
length
and
ponderous
battle
axes
her
heart
failed
and
she
drew
back
but
then
she
thought
again
of
those
she
left
behind
and
all
the
throes
of
perishing
with
hunger
and
resolved
to
risk
all
hazards
the
huge
gate
stood
open
and
strangers
went
and
came
i
join
thought
she
this
straggling
crew
and
enter
among
them
they
speak
my
native
tongue
ah
they
must
be
a
band
of
traitorous
base
renegades
that
have
renounced
the
cross
and
joined
the
dane
else
wherefore
free
to
go
and
come
and
trade
i
all
unsafe
with
such
the
strangers
eyed
her
with
most
curious
and
piercing
looks
and
whispered
as
they
went
they
seemed
afraid
and
shunned
her
by
the
way
as
they
who
shun
a
being
infected
by
the
pestilence
or
spirit
from
the
dead
no
one
addressed
a
word
to
her
but
hurried
to
the
gate
she
came
alone
for
feeble
was
her
step
and
her
breast
palpitating
as
with
throb
of
burning
fever
hopeless
of
admission
the
porters
stared
with
wide
extended
gaze
and
eyes
protruding
but
no
word
they
spoke
nor
crossed
their
lances
straight
she
entered
in
what
can
this
mean
thought
she
there
is
a
change
since
that
it
passes
thought
to
comprehend
these
keepers
are
not
danes
i
heard
them
speak
in
albyn
ancient
tongue
and
yet
methinks
they
wear
the
danish
garb
how
this
that
i
am
free
to
come
and
go
as
in
my
childhood
when
the
land
was
free
she
passed
the
sacred
fane
and
there
beheld
crowds
entering
in
but
fast
she
sped
away
weening
they
went
to
odin
cursed
rites
she
went
to
those
that
sold
and
asked
for
bread
the
woman
stared
at
her
with
silent
gaze
she
asked
again
and
straight
the
huckster
fled
in
floundering
haste
poor
lena
stood
amazed
how
this
said
she
i
show
my
face
the
people
shun
me
here
i
shall
remain
for
i
am
faint
with
hunger
till
i
taste
some
of
these
cakes
which
i
can
well
repay
she
stood
not
long
until
she
was
accosted
by
holy
bedesman
who
with
cautious
step
and
looks
of
terror
entered
fast
repeating
his
in
the
virgin
name
cried
he
and
under
sanction
of
this
cross
i
charge
thee
tell
who
or
from
whence
thou
art
the
virgin
kneeled
and
kissed
the
holy
symbol
but
waived
direct
reply
i
lack
some
bread
to
give
to
those
that
famish
and
i
pay
for
that
which
i
receive
was
her
reply
then
is
the
bread
of
life
that
thou
dost
lack
man
natural
food
i
fear
thou
not
use
for
thou
art
not
a
being
of
this
world
but
of
the
grave
thy
robes
are
mouldy
and
fall
from
off
thy
frame
thy
lips
are
parched
and
colourless
these
eyes
have
not
the
light
of
human
life
thou
ominous
visitant
declare
from
whence
thou
art
and
on
what
mission
thou
to
this
devoted
wasted
land
lena
looked
up
the
holy
father
face
to
her
appeared
familiar
but
how
great
the
change
since
last
she
saw
it
father
brand
dost
thou
not
know
me
was
her
home
reply
with
blenching
cheek
and
with
unstable
eye
the
father
gazed
and
faultering
stammered
forth
no
jesu
maria
be
thy
servant
shield
yes
now
i
know
thee
art
thou
not
the
spirit
of
the
hapless
ellamere
who
was
put
down
within
our
convent
for
a
wilful
breach
of
its
most
sacred
law
avaunt
begone
nor
come
thou
here
t
accuse
those
that
grieved
for
thee
while
they
executed
just
vengeance
on
thy
life
injurious
ghost
thy
curses
have
fallen
heavy
on
our
heads
and
brought
the
wrath
of
heaven
upon
our
land
in
tenfold
measure
in
the
saviour
name
whose
delegate
i
am
i
charge
thee
hence
unto
thy
to
that
award
that
heaven
strict
justice
hath
ordained
for
thee
and
come
not
with
that
pale
and
withering
look
more
curses
and
more
judgments
to
pronounce
reach
me
thine
hand
said
she
and
held
her
forth
meaning
to
work
conviction
on
his
mind
that
she
was
flesh
and
blood
her
arm
was
wan
as
death
itself
emaciated
and
withered
and
furred
with
lines
livid
and
colourless
as
by
corrodent
vapours
of
the
grave
the
monk
withdrew
his
hand
within
his
frock
shook
his
grey
locks
and
with
slow
palsied
step
moved
backward
till
the
threshold
stone
he
gained
then
turned
and
fled
amain
the
household
dame
fled
also
from
her
inner
door
from
which
she
peered
and
listened
and
the
wondering
virgin
again
was
left
alone
she
waited
there
in
wild
and
dumb
incertitude
a
space
then
took
some
bread
some
fruits
and
baken
meat
laid
some
money
down
as
an
equivalent
and
went
away
to
seek
her
dark
retreat
but
as
she
passed
the
fane
with
wary
step
she
ventured
to
the
porch
and
marvelling
heard
the
whole
assembly
joined
in
rapt
devotion
praising
the
name
of
jesus
close
she
stood
and
darkling
as
it
was
joined
in
the
choir
so
much
beloved
but
all
the
wonders
she
so
late
had
seen
yielded
to
this
in
one
short
night
one
strange
eventful
night
such
things
were
done
as
human
intellect
with
all
its
cunning
could
not
calculate
she
passed
the
gate
the
gaping
sentinels
stood
as
they
did
before
immoveable
each
casting
sidelong
glances
unto
his
mate
to
note
who
first
should
fly
or
call
the
word
she
beckoned
them
as
with
intent
to
speak
but
in
one
moment
porters
spears
and
axes
scattered
and
vanished
in
the
darksome
shade
reaching
the
cave
she
found
the
lamp
gone
out
that
their
mysterious
deliverer
had
left
them
over
night
first
she
regaled
her
hearts
with
the
miraculous
tidings
that
all
the
people
worshipped
jesus
name
without
dismay
or
molestation
who
but
the
night
before
not
for
their
lives
durst
have
acknowledged
him
that
all
seemed
free
to
go
and
come
and
pray
to
whom
they
listed
the
tale
seemed
a
romance
a
dream
of
wild
delirium
the
danes
could
not
be
banished
in
a
night
and
all
the
land
cleared
of
the
vile
idolatry
of
odin
they
disbelieved
the
whole
as
well
they
might
but
held
their
peace
dreading
their
sister
mind
mazed
in
derangement
still
as
she
went
on
saying
that
all
whom
she
had
met
or
seen
supposed
her
one
arisen
from
the
dead
or
ghost
of
some
departed
criminal
strangled
for
breach
of
a
monastic
vow
then
did
they
grasp
each
other
hands
and
weep
for
their
dear
sister
sad
mishap
they
deemed
her
mad
as
raving
whirlwind
or
the
music
of
mountain
cataract
yet
she
had
brought
them
food
of
various
sorts
which
in
the
dark
she
gave
them
and
they
fed
or
strove
to
feed
but
small
indeed
the
portion
they
devoured
how
this
cried
morna
that
my
little
cake
grows
the
less
can
it
be
so
that
we
are
truly
spirits
ghosts
of
the
three
maids
that
overthrew
the
danish
god
last
night
i
hunger
and
i
thirst
is
true
tell
me
can
spirits
drink
the
element
of
water
certes
they
may
but
then
how
did
we
die
or
when
for
i
can
not
remember
me
of
passing
death
hideous
and
dreary
bourn
though
something
of
a
weary
painful
dream
hangs
round
my
heart
this
vague
disjointed
speech
the
wayward
visions
of
distemperature
struck
the
two
others
motionless
and
set
them
on
cogitations
wandering
and
wild
as
meteors
a
dreary
wilderness
the
thought
of
being
in
a
new
existence
with
all
its
unknown
trials
powers
and
limits
their
struggling
minds
essayed
in
vain
to
grasp
reason
returned
but
as
a
returns
to
frenzied
orphan
dying
bed
they
felt
each
other
pulses
there
was
life
corporeal
life
but
still
there
was
a
change
which
no
one
chose
to
mention
yet
a
change
quite
unaccountable
for
one
night
sleep
to
have
effected
from
their
cavern
porch
they
viewed
the
stars
of
heaven
they
were
the
same
as
they
were
wont
they
saw
the
golden
wain
the
polar
plough
tilling
his
ample
field
with
slow
unwearied
furrow
and
the
sisters
the
seven
lovely
sisters
of
the
sky
arching
their
gorgeous
path
far
to
the
east
they
spied
a
star
beloved
which
in
their
childhood
they
oft
had
watched
and
named
the
tiger
eye
changing
its
vivid
colours
as
of
yore
and
then
they
wept
to
think
of
former
days
of
innocence
and
joy
and
thus
in
tears
clasped
in
each
arms
they
laid
them
down
their
mazed
and
oppressed
spirits
to
compose
while
thus
they
lay
romantic
morna
said
my
sisters
it
is
evident
to
all
that
some
great
change
has
happed
to
us
last
night
we
are
not
what
we
were
what
can
it
be
but
change
from
one
existence
to
another
a
mortal
creature
can
not
touch
or
feel
a
disembodied
spirit
but
we
know
not
how
spirits
feel
each
other
sure
as
life
and
death
hold
opposition
in
this
world
from
the
one
into
the
other
we
have
passed
i
feel
it
in
my
being
so
do
you
though
unacknowledged
let
us
rise
and
walk
as
spirits
do
by
night
and
we
shall
see
the
change
in
us
not
over
a
whole
land
in
one
short
night
come
let
us
roam
abroad
i
feel
a
restlessness
a
strong
desire
to
flit
from
place
to
place
perchance
to
fly
between
the
mountain
and
the
cloud
and
view
the
abodes
of
those
we
love
this
wild
romance
waked
in
the
virgins
hearts
an
energy
between
despair
and
madness
all
extremes
erratic
and
unnatural
on
the
minds
of
females
act
like
the
infection
of
virulent
disease
up
they
arose
and
stepping
from
their
cavern
took
their
way
along
the
brink
midnight
was
past
the
tiger
eye
had
climbed
the
marble
path
that
branches
through
the
heaven
and
goggled
forth
now
red
now
blue
now
purple
and
now
green
down
from
his
splendid
ceiling
far
on
high
was
like
a
changeful
spirit
in
the
east
the
hues
of
morning
rose
in
towering
streaks
as
if
the
almighty
had
caused
light
to
grow
like
cedars
from
the
summits
of
the
hills
it
was
a
scene
for
spirits
there
were
three
abroad
that
morn
before
the
twilight
rose
three
creatures
spiritual
yet
made
of
flesh
first
they
espied
an
aged
fisherman
who
passed
without
regard
then
did
they
deem
they
were
invisible
and
wilder
still
their
fancies
worked
the
suburbs
now
they
gained
of
the
resplendent
ancient
otholine
the
emporium
of
the
east
and
hand
in
hand
with
hurried
but
enfeebled
step
they
trode
its
lanes
and
alleys
those
who
saw
them
said
their
motions
were
erratic
like
the
gait
of
beings
overcome
with
wine
or
creatures
learning
to
walk
for
the
first
time
on
earth
the
early
matron
and
the
twilight
groom
fled
with
hysteric
cries
at
their
approach
the
gates
were
left
the
streets
a
waste
porter
and
sentinel
joined
in
the
flight
and
nought
but
terror
and
confusion
reigned
the
virgin
sisters
wist
not
what
to
do
or
what
to
dread
within
the
convent
porch
they
halted
turned
and
gazed
on
one
another
and
wondered
what
they
were
that
nature
thus
shuddered
at
their
approach
and
held
aloof
three
creatures
spiritual
yet
made
of
flesh
belonging
not
to
heaven
nor
earth
but
shunned
by
the
inhabitants
of
both
just
then
while
standing
in
despondency
they
heard
the
grey
cock
crow
the
eldritch
clarion
note
chilled
every
heart
and
twanged
on
every
nerve
that
is
our
warning
call
wild
morna
said
my
sisters
now
we
must
hence
and
begone
that
is
the
of
the
murdering
spirits
we
shall
be
missed
at
matins
to
your
homes
your
damp
and
mouldering
homes
ye
ghastly
shades
the
daylight
will
dissolve
you
does
that
voice
not
say
so
hush
thee
gentle
morna
drive
us
not
to
distraction
here
we
wait
until
the
convent
matin
then
we
ask
the
holy
prioress
what
things
we
are
what
say
you
gentle
sisters
can
we
live
outcasts
on
earth
in
such
incertitude
our
father
towers
are
distant
we
can
glide
like
passing
shades
with
slow
and
feeble
motion
but
nothing
more
spirits
can
sail
the
air
in
skiff
of
mist
or
on
the
breeze
wing
such
powers
we
have
not
and
to
journey
there
we
lack
ability
here
then
we
stay
until
we
are
resolved
what
strange
events
have
happened
to
us
to
our
native
land
and
church
of
late
so
grievously
oppressed
yes
here
we
stay
come
rouse
the
porteress
for
see
the
sun
tips
the
far
hills
with
gold
and
we
shall
melt
before
his
tepid
ray
all
gentle
as
it
is
at
early
morn
my
frame
is
like
a
mildew
the
hoar
frost
of
death
hath
fallen
on
it
oh
for
the
guide
the
angelic
youth
that
left
us
ho
daughters
of
the
cross
if
any
here
hath
the
murderous
dane
come
forth
and
welcome
the
conquerors
of
odin
ho
within
wake
ere
the
sun
upbraids
you
he
is
up
on
service
to
his
maker
yet
you
sleep
i
say
wake
who
calls
what
are
you
there
we
know
not
what
we
are
for
that
we
come
to
see
if
any
here
can
us
resolve
but
two
short
nights
ago
we
were
three
maids
of
royal
lineage
thou
stern
porteress
come
forth
and
look
on
us
canst
thou
not
tell
what
we
are
made
of
why
thou
aloof
speak
calmly
sister
morna
see
she
trembles
and
dares
not
answer
gentle
dame
we
pray
admission
to
your
lady
prioress
for
sake
of
him
who
died
upon
the
cross
whose
name
we
worship
straight
she
vanished
upon
her
fearful
mission
glad
to
from
such
a
colloquy
soon
then
arrived
the
aged
prioress
who
them
approached
with
dauntless
countenance
and
unappalled
asked
of
their
errand
venerable
dame
dost
thou
not
know
or
hast
thou
never
heard
of
the
three
maids
of
stormont
who
of
late
led
by
a
heavenly
messenger
the
god
of
denmark
and
upheld
the
cross
triumphant
the
breasts
of
prostrate
heathens
ay
i
have
heard
of
them
and
often
joined
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
for
the
deliverance
wrought
by
these
royal
virgins
that
was
a
conquest
that
roused
the
spirit
of
the
christian
to
deeds
of
more
than
mortal
energy
and
humbled
the
proud
confidence
the
dane
placed
in
his
idols
ay
that
was
a
conquest
shall
cloud
the
brow
of
the
idolater
while
the
world
stands
but
what
was
it
you
spoke
of
yester
eve
either
you
are
deranged
or
shallow
poor
impostors
for
that
time
hath
long
gone
past
and
the
three
wondrous
maids
were
in
the
sight
and
from
the
middle
of
that
mighty
host
translated
into
heaven
unless
you
came
from
thence
on
sacred
mission
and
bringest
evidence
of
identity
by
further
miracle
better
you
had
keep
silence
and
depart
we
are
those
maids
the
maids
of
stormont
nieces
to
the
king
and
we
require
of
you
lodging
and
fair
protection
till
we
prove
our
lineage
there
is
something
passing
strange
hath
happed
to
us
but
what
the
circumstance
or
how
accordant
with
the
works
of
god
is
far
beyond
the
fathom
and
the
height
of
our
capacity
we
are
the
maids
of
stormont
to
that
truth
we
will
make
oath
upon
the
holy
cross
the
prioress
crossed
herself
commended
her
to
heaven
and
with
deep
awe
and
dire
astonishment
admitted
them
she
gazed
upon
them
their
fair
cheeks
were
pale
and
their
benignant
eyes
looked
through
a
haze
that
was
not
earthly
it
was
like
the
blue
mists
of
the
dawning
all
their
robes
were
of
the
fashion
of
a
former
day
and
they
were
damp
and
mouldy
falling
piecemeal
from
off
their
bodies
with
their
rottenness
i
dread
to
question
you
mysterious
things
that
you
are
earthly
forms
i
see
and
feel
whence
are
you
in
what
dreary
unknown
clime
have
you
been
sojourning
or
are
you
risen
from
out
your
graves
if
you
have
truth
in
you
and
power
to
tell
it
pray
resolve
me
this
for
i
am
lost
in
wonder
what
we
are
we
know
not
for
that
purpose
we
came
hither
that
you
might
tell
us
all
we
know
is
this
last
night
but
one
we
were
the
maids
of
stormont
doomed
to
a
dreadful
fate
an
heavenly
one
came
to
our
rescue
led
us
through
the
gates
of
iron
and
of
brass
still
as
we
went
we
conquered
ranks
of
proud
idolaters
fell
prostrate
in
the
dust
and
the
great
god
the
mighty
odin
was
and
dashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
straight
our
blessed
guide
conducted
us
into
a
lonely
cave
close
by
the
river
brink
and
bade
us
sleep
and
take
our
rest
until
the
day
should
dawn
and
shadows
fly
away
we
slept
and
when
we
awoke
the
lamp
our
guide
had
left
still
feebly
burned
impelled
by
hunger
from
our
cave
we
ventured
all
people
fly
from
us
the

gone
the
name
of

nought
we

nought
we

miracle
a
mighty
miracle

days

burning
over

day
hath
dawned
such
day
of
grace
as
scotland
hath
not
seen
the
heathen
dane
with
all
his
hideous
gods
was
vanquished
but
days
of
darkness
and
contention
rose
until
this
time
when
all
the
glorious
rays
of
mercy
and
of
grace
have
shed
their
influence
on
this
benighted
persecuted
land
and
you
are
waked
to
enjoy
it
let
us
go
straight
to
the
altar
and
beneath
the
cross
join
in
elated
thanksgiving
the
chancel
door
opened
before
the
altar
when
the
three
virgins
entered
in
and
saw
the
figure
on
the
cross
they
cried
aloud
with
one
combined
voice
is
he

he
what
have
these
heathens
dared
to
lay
their
impious
hands
on
him
is
he

you
look
upon
hangs
there
to
represent
the
death
of
him
who
died
that
man
might
live
and
is
it
so
then
be
our
lives
sacred
unto
the
service
of
him
who
laid
his
life
down
for
our
race
and
sent
his
angel
to
deliver
us
in
his
own
likeness
too
for
this
is
he
who
came
to
us
in
great
extremity
when
we
called
on
the
name
of
our
redeemer
in
agony
of
soul
remain
with
me
till
our
great
festival
this
miracle
must
be
made
known
to
all
that
trust
in
jesus
name
meanwhile
i
will
cherish
and
comfort
the
beloved
of
heaven
the
day
arrived
of
the
great
festival
the
anniversary
of
the
overthrow
of
mighty
odin
that
sublime
event
that
broke
the
bands
of
iron
and
of
steel
and
threw
the
gates
of
superstition
open
to
christian
triumph
on
that
day
the
king
whole
household
nobles
of
the
realm
high
dames
and
commons
abbots
monks
and
mendicants
a
motely
and
a
countless
multitude
assembled
early
at
the
monastery
of
ancient
otholine
to
render
thanks
for
their
deliverance
masses
were
said
and
holy
hymns
of
praise
ascended
to
the
skies
with
one
accord
then
all
the
grateful
multitude
agreed
to
canonize
the
three
heroic
virgins
who
with
the
aid
of
angels
had
wrought
out
the
triumph
the
beloved
of
heaven
translated
to
the
blest
beatitude
where
souls
of
saints
and
blessed
martyrs
dwell
and
whose
joint
prayers
might
with
the
holy
virgin
much
avail
a
joyful
clamour
for
the
ordinance
then
spread
around
so
eager
were
the
crowd
to
kneel
and
pay
their
humble
adorations
to
the
three
maids
translated
to
the
heavens
with
bodies
like
their
own
applauses
rang
and
from
behind
the
altar
was
given
forth
a
song
divine
in
which
a
thousand
voices
joined
till
all
were
hushed
at
this
ecstatic
strain
hail
to
the
happy
three
vessels
of
sanctity
now
honoured
to
stand
at
the
virgin
right
hand
mater
dei
remember
me
remember
us
all
and
send
us
for
good
bone
of
our
bone
and
blood
of
our
song
of
harp
and
voice
be
dumb
the
heaven
is
oped
they
come
they
come
a
bustle
rose
the
abbot
on
his
knees
sunk
down
and
leaned
upon
the
and
only
a
few
voices
whispered
round
they
come
they
come
the
congregation
turned
their
eyes
into
the
chancel
and
beheld
three
virgins
all
in
robes
of
purest
white
stand
over
against
the
altar
the
loud
choir
was
hushed
and
every
brow
was
forward
bent
in
low
obeisance
all
believing
these
three
beauteous
flowers
from
paradise
had
come
arrayed
in
robes
of
heaven
with
angel
forms
that
bloomed
like
winter
roses
newly
oped
in
high
approval
of
the
festival
and
sacred
honours
to
be
paid
to
them
the
virgins
beckoned
raised
their
flowing
veils
and
their
right
hands
to
heaven
stay
they
cried
stay
the
solemnity
ere
you
profane
the
name
and
altar
of
the
god
of
heaven
here
stand
the
three
unworthy
maids
of
stormont
whom
you
would
deify
come
nigh
to
us
our
father
and
our
king
and
ye
chaste
ministers
of
him
we
serve
come
nigh
and
feel
that
we
are
mortal
like
yourselves
and
stop
the
rite
pay
adoration
to
that
holy
one
who
pitied
us
in
misery
extreme
and
you
in
grievous
bonds
there
be
your
vows
and
worship
paid
in
which
we
three
shall
join
he
hath
indeed
done
wondrous
things
for
us
works
of
amazement
which
you
all
shall
hear
and
whoso
heareth
shall
rejoice
in
heart
then
came
they
all
unto
their
father
knee
kneeled
and
embraced
him
while
the
good
old
earl
shed
tears
of
joy
and
rendered
thanks
to
heaven
their
sovereign
next
their
former
lovers
friends
and
all
they
knew
in
that
mixed
multitude
they
did
embrace
that
no
remaining
doubt
might
spring
and
spread
of
their
identity
it
was
a
joyful
meeting
such
a
one
as
hath
not
been
in
any
land
for
happiness
and
holy
ecstacy
they
lived
beyond
the
years
of
women
but
their
lives
were
spent
in
acts
of
holiness
apart
from
grandeur
train
in
curing
of
the
sick
clothing
the
naked
ministering
to
all
in
want
and
wretchedness
and
speaking
peace
unto
poor
wandering
and
benighted
souls
their
evening
of
life
was
like
the
close
of
summer
day
pure
placid
and
serene
the
twilight
long
but
when
at
last
it
closed
it
was
with
such
a
heavenly
glow
it
gave
pure
prospect
of
a
joyous
day
to
come
thus
ends
my
legend
and
with
all
submission
i
bow
to
your
awards
and
wait
my
doom
chap
iii
prick
on
good
markham
that
galled
jade
of
yours
moves
with
a
hedgehog
pace
is
this
a
time
to
amble
like
a
belle
at
tournament
when
life
and
death
hang
on
our
enterprize
we
had
long
stages
garolde
we
must
take
up
what
miscreants
have
we
here
lo
have
not
i
taken
great
delight
in
the
words
of
thy
mouth
said
the
friar
for
it
is
a
legend
of
purity
and
holiness
which
thou
hast
told
and
the
words
of
truth
are
contained
in
it
peradventure
it
may
be
an
ancient
allegory
of
our
nation
in
which
manner
of
instruction
the
fathers
of
christianity
amongst
us
took
great
delight
but
whether
it
be
truth
or
whether
it
be
fiction
the
tendency
is
good
and
behold
is
it
not
so
do
not
i
even
thank
thee
for
thy
tale
it
is
the
most
diffuse
extravagant
and
silly
legend
that
ever
was
invented
by
votary
of
a
silly
and
inconsistent
creed
said
the
master
i
side
wi
you
master
michael
scott
said
tam
craik
i
think
the
tale
is
nought
but
a
string
of
bombastical
nonsense
excepting
ane
about
fat
flesh
i
think
i
never
heard
the
match
said
the
laird
of
the
peatstacknowe
it
brings
me
o
our
host
dinner
that
was
a
show
but
nae
substance
if
i
foresee
aught
aright
said
the
master
of
many
a
worse
dinner
shall
i
see
thee
partake
and
enjoy
the
sight
was
not
that
a
beautiful
and
sublime
tale
father
said
delany
i
could
sit
and
listen
to
such
divine
legends
for
ever
the
poet
eyes
shone
with
tears
when
he
heard
the
maid
he
loved
say
these
words
to
the
friar
apart
who
answered
and
said
unto
her
lo
there
are
many
more
sublime
and
more
wonderful
in
thy
little
book
nevertheless
the
tale
is
good
for
instruction
to
those
that
are
faithless
and
doubting
alak
i
fear
i
shall
not
live
to
learn
and
enjoy
these
do
not
you
think
father
that
we
shall
all
perish
in
this
miserable
place
added
delany
this
horrible
place
of
witchcraft
and
divination
charlie
scott
stepped
forward
when
he
overheard
some
of
these
words
eh
what
was
the
lassie
saying
said
he
eh
i
tell
ye
what
it
is
hinney
i
believe
ye
see
things
as
they
are
there
naething
but
witchcraft
gaun
on
here
and
it
is
that
and
that
alone
that
a
our
perils
and
mischances
rise
frae
begging
your
pardon
father
i
canna
help
thinking
what
i
think
and
seeing
what
i
see
but
gude
faith
we
maun
blaw
lown
till
we
win
aff
the
tap
o
this
bigging
if
that
ever
be
my
hand
hath
prevailed
against
his
hand
said
the
friar
and
my
master
over
his
master
and
had
it
not
been
for
this
miserable
accident
we
should
have
had
nothing
to
fear
from
his
divinations
sublime
and
mighty
as
they
are
what
hath
become
of
the
mighty
men
of
valour
from
the
camp
of
our
captain
o
there
nae
mortal
can
tell
said
charlie
it
was
not
for
naething
that
dan
and
his
lads
ran
off
and
left
us
without
ever
looking
ower
their
shoulders
a
witchcraft
a
witchcraft
ane
may
stand
against
muckle
but
nae
man
can
stand
against
that
i
wish
we
were
where
sword
and
shield
could
aince
mair
stand
us
in
stead
but
this
i
sure
o
now
that
our
situation
is
kend
to
our
kinsman
it
winna
be
lang
before
some
aid
appear
o
if
it
wad
but
come
afore
we
are
driven
to
that
last
and
warst
of
a
shifts
to
keep
in
life
we
canna
live
another
day
said
tam
i
therefore
propose
that
the
maid
and
the
boy
try
ilk
ane
their
hand
at
a
tale
too
and
stand
their
chances
with
the
rest
of
us
their
lives
are
of
less
value
and
their
bodies
very
tender
and
delicate
every
one
protested
against
tam
motion
with
abhorrence
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
now
appeal
to
the
master
who
had
told
the
worst
tale
not
that
the
unfortunate
victim
was
to
be
immediately
sacrificed
nor
even
till
the
very
last
extremity
but
with
that
impatience
natural
to
man
they
longed
to
be
put
out
of
pain
every
one
having
hopes
that
his
own
merits
protected
himself
from
danger
every
one
also
believed
that
judgment
would
be
given
against
tam
except
he
himself
and
that
at
all
events
such
an
award
would
put
an
end
to
his
disagreeable
and
endless
exultations
of
voracious
delight
they
then
went
before
the
renowned
wizard
and
desired
him
to
give
judgment
who
of
them
had
related
the
worst
and
most
inefficient
tale
laying
all
prejudice
with
regard
to
creeds
and
testimonies
aside
he
asked
them
if
they
referred
the
matter
entirely
to
him
or
if
they
wished
to
have
each
one
a
vote
of
their
own
tam
said
it
was
an
understanding
at
first
that
each
should
have
a
vote
and
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
on
the
subject
he
wished
to
give
his
charlie
said
it
was
a
hard
matter
to
vote
away
the
life
of
a
friend
and
for
his
part
he
would
rather
appeal
to
the
great
master
altogether
but
if
any
doubts
should
remain
with
any
one
of
their
host
impartiality
he
thought
it
fairer
that
they
should
cast
lots
and
hazard
all
alike
the
poet
who
had
heard
the
master
disapprobation
given
pointedly
of
his
tale
sided
with
yardbire
and
voted
that
it
should
be
decided
by
lot
gibbie
though
quite
convinced
in
his
own
mind
that
he
had
told
the
best
story
yet
having
heard
the
of
it
doubted
and
dreading
on
that
score
to
have
some
voices
against
him
called
also
for
a
vote
for
he
said
the
referring
the
matter
to
the
master
brought
him
in
mind
of
the
story
of
the
fox
sitting
in
judgment
and
deciding
against
the
lamb
the
friar
also
said
verily
i
should
give
my
voice
for
the
judgment
of
the
master
to
stand
decisive
but
lo
is
it
not
apparent
that
his
thoughts
are
not
like
the
thoughts
of
other
men
neither
is
his
mind
governed
by
the
motives
of
the
rest
of
the
children
of
men
i
do
therefore
lift
up
my
voice
for
the
judgment
that
goeth
by
lot
i
would
notwithstanding
of
all
this
gladly
hear
what
the
master
would
say
i
will
be
so
far
just
that
i
shall
give
you
your
choice
said
master
michael
scott
nevertheless
i
can
tell
you
if
there
be
any
justice
in
the
decision
by
lot
on
whom
the
lot
will
fall
a
pause
of
breathless
anxiety
occurred
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
grim
and
stern
visage
of
the
great
necromancer
over
whose
features
there
appeared
to
pass
a
gleam
of
wild
delight
it
will
fall
added
he
on
that
man
of
fables
and
similitudes
who
himself
bears
the
similitude
of
a
man
just
as
the
lion
hide
stuffed
does
the
resemblance
of
a
real
one
how
do
you
call
that
beautiful
and
amiable
being
with
the
nose
that
would
split
a
drop
of
rain
without
being
wet
most
illustrious
knight
and
master
of
the
arts
of
mystery
said
the
friar
as
this
man
is
so
is
his
name
for
he
is
called
jordan
after
the
great
river
that
is
in
the
east
which
overfloweth
its
banks
at
certain
seasons
and
falls
into
the
stagnant
lake
called
the
dead
sea
whose
waters
are
diseased
so
doth
the
matter
of
this
our
friend
overflow
pass
away
and
is
lost
but
what
sayest
thou
of
the
default
of
his
story
dost
thou
remember
that
it
is
not
for
the
best
story
that
we
cast
lots
but
the
worst
ay
that
weel
said
good
friar
said
charlie
for
trifling
as
the
laird
story
was
i
never
heard
ought
sae
queer
or
that
interested
ane
mair
if
there
be
ony
justice
in
lots
the
safe
your
was
the
best
tale
gallant
yeoman
said
the
master
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
you
are
safe
the
dumb
judge
will
not
err
and
there
is
one
overlooks
the
judgment
by
lot
of
whom
few
are
aware
i
say
your
was
the
best
tale
thank
ye
kindly
master
michael
scott
said
charlie
i
feared
ilk
ane
winna
be
o
your
opinion
the
friar
then
took
from
the
of
his
frock
a
few
scraps
of
parchment
amounting
to
fifteen
twelve
of
these
he
marked
with
a
red
cross
and
three
with
a
black
one
to
prevent
all
infernal
interference
then
rolling
them
closely
up
he
counted
them
all
into
his
cowl
before
his
companions
and
shaking
them
together
he
caused
every
one
to
do
the
same
then
putting
the
cowl
into
the
hand
they
desired
her
to
hold
it
until
they
drew
forth
their
scraps
one
by
one
she
did
so
while
her
bright
eyes
were
drowned
in
tears
and
each
of
the
candidates
put
in
his
hand
selecting
his
lot
let
them
be
opened
one
by
one
before
all
these
witnesses
cried
the
master
that
no
suspicions
of
foul
play
whatever
may
remain
the
friar
drew
forth
his
without
one
muscle
of
his
unyielding
features
being
altered
and
turning
deliberately
about
he
opened
it
before
them
all
it
was
red
the
friar
bowed
his
head
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
charlie
thrust
in
his
hand
pulled
out
a
ticket
and
tore
it
open
all
in
one
moment
and
with
the
same
impatience
that
he
fought
in
a
battle
his
was
likewise
red
gude
faith
i
aince
ower
the
water
said
charlie
tam
put
in
his
hand
with
a
decision
that
would
have
done
honour
to
a
better
man
the
form
of
his
mouth
only
being
a
little
altered
now
who
will
take
me
a
bet
of
a
old
cout
cried
gibbie
that
the
next
shall
turn
out
a
black
one
and
he
grinned
a
ghastly
smile
in
anticipation
of
the
wished
event
tam
kept
his
hand
within
the
cowl
for
a
good
while
as
if
groping
which
to
select
at
length
he
drew
one
forth
and
before
he
got
it
opened
gibbie
long
nose
and
his
own
had
met
above
it
so
eager
was
each
of
them
to
see
what
it
contained
it
was
opened
each
of
them
raised
up
his
face
and
looked
at
the
face
of
his
opponent
but
with
what
different
expressions
of
countenance
the
cross
on
the
lot
was
red
grief
dread
and
disappointment
were
all
apparent
in
the
features
of
poor
jordan
while
the
exulting
looks
of
his
provoking
neighbour
were
hardly
to
be
endured
what
think
you
o
that
now
laird
cried
he
what
does
that
bring
you
in
mind
o
eh
i
say
wha
jugular
vein
swells
highest
now
or
wha
stands
maist
need
o
clawing
this
was
rather
more
than
gibbie
was
disposed
at
that
juncture
to
bear
and
when
tam
as
he
concluded
put
forth
his
forefinger
to
ascertain
the
thickness
of
fat
on
the
laird
ribs
the
latter
struck
him
with
such
force
on
the
wrist
that
he
rendered
his
arm
powerless
for
a
space
he
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
but
could
not
grasp
it
while
gibbie
seeing
the
motion
had
his
out
in
a
twinkling
and
if
the
staunch
friar
had
not
turned
it
aside
he
would
have
had
it
through
the
heart
of
the
deil
tam
in
a
second
which
might
have
prevented
the
further
drawing
of
lots
for
that
present
time
and
thereby
put
an
end
to
a
very
critical
and
disagreeable
business
gibbie
was
far
from
being
a
hot
or
passionate
man
but
whether
his
rage
was
a
manoere
to
put
by
the
decision
or
if
he
really
was
offended
at
being
handled
like
a
wedder
for
slaughter
the
curate
pretends
not
to
guess
he
however
raged
and
fumed
exceedingly
and
tried
again
and
again
to
wound
tam
while
the
rest
were
remonstrating
with
him
nor
would
he
be
pacified
until
tam
disabled
arm
by
degrees
regaining
somewhat
of
its
pristine
nerve
he
retreated
back
towards
the
battlement
for
and
dared
the
laird
to
the
combat
gibbie
struggled
hard
but
finding
that
they
were
about
to
let
him
go
his
wrath
subsided
a
little
he
put
up
his
sword
and
said
the
whole
business
reminded
him
of
a
story
of
the
laird
of
tweelsdon
and
his
two
brothers
which
he
assured
them
was
a
prime
story
and
begged
permission
to
tell
it
this
was
protested
against
with
one
voice
until
the
business
of
the
lots
was
decided
and
then
all
were
willing
to
hear
it
oh
the
lots
that
is
quite
true
said
gibbie
i
declare
that
business
had
gone
out
of
my
head
let
us
see
what
casts
up
next
there
was
a
relaxation
in
every
muscle
of
face
as
he
put
his
hand
into
the
cowl
but
gibbie
was
a
sort
of
a
cross
face
it
did
not
grow
long
and
sallow
as
most
other
men
faces
do
when
they
are
agitated
the
jaws
did
not
fall
down
they
closed
up
so
that
his
face
grew
a
great
deal
shorter
and
broader
the
and
the
met
and
the
nose
and
chin
approached
to
a
close
vicinity
he
drew
forth
the
momentous
scrap
and
with
fumbling
and
paralytic
hand
opened
it
before
them
the
cross
was
black
he
dared
not
lift
his
eyes
to
any
face
there
save
to
delany
and
when
he
saw
it
covered
with
tears
his
looks
again
reverted
that
way
this
lot
it
is
true
was
not
decisive
yet
it
placed
gibbie
on
ticklish
ground
it
having
been
agreed
that
whoever
should
draw
the
two
first
black
crosses
subjected
himself
to
immolation
if
the
necessity
of
the
case
required
it
the
great
master
and
tam
were
visibly
well
pleased
with
the
wicked
chance
that
had
fallen
to
the
laird
the
motives
of
the
former
for
this
delight
were
quite
a
mystery
to
those
who
beheld
it
as
for
tam
he
seemed
determined
to
keep
no
more
terms
with
poor
gibbie
the
poet
also
drew
a
red
one
and
then
it
was
decreed
that
the
next
round
gibbie
should
have
his
choice
of
the
time
if
he
judged
it
any
advantage
either
to
be
first
or
last
he
seemed
quite
passive
and
said
it
was
all
one
to
him
he
should
draw
at
any
time
they
chose
and
desired
his
friend
yardbire
as
he
termed
him
to
choose
for
him
charlie
said
he
deemed
the
first
chance
the
best
as
he
had
then
four
chances
to
be
right
for
one
of
being
wrong
and
it
would
be
singular
indeed
if
his
hand
fixed
on
a
black
cross
again
for
a
time
or
two
when
more
of
them
might
be
on
an
equal
footing
gibbie
accordingly
turned
round
and
drew
out
one
more
of
the
ominous
scraps
opening
it
under
the
eyes
of
all
the
circle
with
rather
a
hopeful
look
if
the
deil
be
nae
in
the
cowl
i
shall
hae
a
red
ane
this
time
said
he
as
he
unrolled
it
but
as
soon
as
the
head
of
the
cross
appeared
the
ticket
fell
from
his
hand
and
as
the
friar
expressed
it
there
was
no
more
strength
remaining
in
him
verily
my
son
thy
fate
is
decided
said
the
latter
worthy
and
that
in
a
wonderful
and
arbitrary
manner
as
the
master
said
so
hath
it
come
to
pass
although
to
judge
of
any
thing
having
been
done
unfairly
is
impossible
it
is
absolute
nonsense
to
talk
of
aught
being
done
fairly
in
this
place
said
charlie
scott
there
naething
but
witchcraft
gaun
i
tell
ye
a
things
here
are
done
by
witchery
an
the
black
arts
and
after
what
i
heard
the
king
of
a
warlocks
say
that
the
lot
wad
in
this
way
i
winna
believe
that
honest
gibbie
has
gotten
fair
play
for
his
life
if
you
would
try
it
an
hundred
times
over
said
the
master
you
would
see
it
turn
out
in
the
same
way
did
not
i
say
to
you
that
there
was
a
power
presided
over
the
decision
by

nor

said
charlie
perhaps
things
may
not
come
to
the
worst
i
have
great
dependence
on
dan
chisholm

the
warden
good
men
i
wonder
they
have
not
appeared
wi
proper
mattocks
or
ladders
by
this
time
o
the
morning
if
they
should
said
the
master
and
if
we
were
all
set
at
liberty
this
minute
he
shall
remain
my
bondsman
in
place
of
these
two
and
him
of
whom
your
arts
have
bereaved
me
remember
to
what
you
agreed
formerly
of
which
i
now
remind
you
i
think
that
is
but
fair
said
the
poet
i
do
not
know
gentlemen
what
you
call
fair
or
foul
said
gibbie
i
think
there
is
little
that
is
favourable
going
for
somebody
of
the
two
evils
i
judge
the
last
the
worst
i
appeal
to
my
captain
the
warden
gibbie
looks
were
so
rueful
and
pitiable
when
he
said
this
that
no
one
had
the
heart
to
remonstrate
farther
with
him
on
the
justice
or
injustice
of
his
doom
the
master
and
tam
enjoyed
his
plight
exceedingly
the
poet
rejoiced
in
it
as
it
tended
to
free
delany
from
a
vile
servitude
and
the
friar
also
was
glad
of
the
release
of
the
darling
of
his
younger
years
the
of
galli
the
scribe
charlie
and
delany
were
the
only
two
that
appeared
to
suffer
on
account
of
the
laird
dismal
prospects
and
their
feelings
were
nearly
as
acute
as
his
own
stories
and
all
sorts
of
amusements
were
now
discontinued
a
damp
was
thrown
over
these
by
the
dismal
gloom
on
the
laird
countenance
and
the
congenial
feelings
of
others
on
his
account
the
night
had
passed
over
without
any
more
visitants
from
the
infernal
regions
the
day
had
arisen
in
the
midst
of
heaviness
and
gloom
and
every
eye
was
turned
towards
the
mill
in
the
expecsation
of
seeing
the
approach
of
dan
and
his
companions

with

companions
spent
a
sleepless
night
not
without
several
alarms
and
breathless
listenings
on
the
occurrence
of
any
noise
without
few
were
the
nightly
journies
on
the
banks
of
the
ettrick
in
those
days
and
few
the
midnight
noises
that
occurred
save
from
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
there
were
no
wooer
lads
straying
at
that
still
and
silent
hour
to
call
up
their
sweethearts
for
an
hour
kind
conversation
save
when
the
english
marauders
were
abroad
all
was
quietness
by
hamlet
and
steading
the
land
was
the
abode
of
the
genii
of
the
woods
the
rocks
and
the
rivers
and
of
this
the
inhabitants
were
well
aware
and
kept
within
locked
doors
whose
lintels
were
made
of
the
mountain
ash
and
nightly
sprinkled
with
holy
water

and

were
also
fenced

book
and

for
the
inmates
knew
that
in
no
other
way
could
they
be
safe
or
rest
in
peace
they
knew
that
their
green
and
solitary
glens
were
the
nightly
haunts
of
the
fairies
and
that
they
held
their
sports
and
amorous
revels
in
the
retiring
dells
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
mermaid
sung
her
sweet
and
alluring
strains
by
the
shores
of
the
mountain
lake
and
the
kelpie
sat
moping
and
dripping
by
his
frightsome
pool
or
the
boiling
caldron
at
the
foot
of
the
cataract
the
fleeting
wraiths
hovered
round
the
dwellings
of
those
who
were
soon
to
die
and
the
stalking
ghost
perambulated
the
walks
of
him
that
was
lately
living
or
took
up
his
nightly
stand
over
the
bones
of
the
unhouseholded
or
murdered
dead
in
such
a
country
and
among
such
sojourners
who
durst
walk
by
night
but
these
were
the
natural
residenters
in
the
wilds
of
the
woodland
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
the
country
and
however
inimical
their
ways
might
be
to
the
ways
of
men
the
latter
laid
their
account
with
them
there
were
defences
to
be
had
against
them
from
holy
church
which
was
a
great
comfort
but
ever
since
master
michael
scott
came
from
the
colleges
abroad
to
reside
at
the
castle
of
aikwood
the
nature
of
demonology
in
the
forest
glades
was
altogether
changed
and
a
full
torrent
of
necromancy
or
as
charlie
scott
better
expressed
it
of
deluged
the
country
all
over
an
art
of
the
most
malignant
and
appalling
kind
against
which
no
fence
yet
discovered
could
prevail
how
different
indeed
became
the
situation
of
the
lonely
hind
formerly
he
only
heard
at
a
distance
on
moonlight
eves
the
bridle
bells
of
the
fairy
troopers
which
haply
caused
him
to
haste
homeward
but
when
the
door
was
barred
and
fenced
he
sat
safe
in
the
middle
of
his
family
circle
as
they
closed
round
the
hearth
and
talked
of
the
pranks
of
gude
when
the
speats
descended
and
floods
roared
and
foamed
from
bank
to
brae
then
would
they
perceive
the
malevolent
kelpie
rolling
and
tumbling
down
the
torrent
like
a
drowning
cow
or
mountain
stag
to
allure
the
hungry
peasant
into
certain
destruction
but
aware
of
the
danger
he
only
kept
the
farther
aloof
quaking
at
the
tremendous
experiment
made
by
the
spirit
of
the
waters
it
was
in
vain
that
the
mermaid
sung
the
sweetest
strain
s
that
ever
breathed
over
the
evening
lake
or
sunk
and
rose
again
spreading
her
hands
for
assistance
like
a
drowning
maiden
at
the
bottom
of
the
abrupt
cliff
washed
by
the
waves
he
be
allured
to
her
embraces
but
what
could
he
do
now
his
daughters
were
turned
into
roes
and
hares
to
be
hunted
down
for
sport
to
the
master
the
old
wives
of
the
hamlet
were
saddled
and
bridled
by
night
and
urged
with
whip
and
spur
over
whole
realms
the
cows
were
deprived
of
their
milk
the
hinds
cast
their
young
and
no
domestic
cat
in
the
whole
district
could
be
kept
alive
for
one
year
that
infernal
system
of
witchcraft
then
began
which
the
stake
and
the
gibbet
could
scarcely
eradicate
in
a
whole
century
it
had
at
this
time
begun
to
spread
all
around
aikwood
but
of
these
things
our
border
troopers
were
not
altogether
aware
they
dreaded
the
spirits
of
the
old
school
the
devil
in
particular
but
of
the
new
prevailing
system
of
metamorphoses
they
had
no
comprehension
dan
and
three
chosen
companions
mounting
their
horses
by
the
break
of
day
rode
straight
for
the
abbey
of
melrose
to
lodge
their
complaint
against
the
great
enemy
of
mankind
and
request
assistance
from
the
holy
fathers
in
rescuing
their
friends
out
of
his
hands
they
reached
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
just
as
they
passed
by
a
small
dell
they
espied
four
horsemen
approaching
them
who
from
their
robes
and
riding
appurtenances
appeared
to
belong
to
the
abbey
and
to
rank
high
among
its
dignitaries
they
were
all
mounted
on
black
steeds
clothed
in
dark
flowing
robes
that
were
fringed
with
costly
fringes
and
they
had
caps
on
their
heads
that
were
horned
like
the
new
moon
the
foremost
in
particular
had
a
formidable
and
majestic
mitre
on
his
head
that
seemed
all
glancing
with
gems
every
one
of
which
was
either
black
or
a
certain
dazzling
red
of
the
colour
of
flame
dan
doffed
his
helmet
to
this
dignified
and
commanding
personage
but
he
deigned
not
either
to
return
our
yeoman
low
bow
that
brought
his
face
in
contact
with
the
mane
of
his
steed
or
once
to
cross
his
hand
on
his
brow
in
token
of
accepting
the
submission
proffered
he
however
reined
up
his
black
steed
and
sat
upright
on
his
saddle
as
if
in
the
act
of
listening
what
this
bold
and
blunt
trooper
had
to
say
begging
pardon
of
your
grand
and
sublime
reverence
said
dan
i
presume
from
your
lofty

demeanour
habiliments
and

and
also

are

to
look
for

the
sublime
abbot
shook
his
head
as
if
in
scorn
and
derision
of
the
apothegm
and
sat
still
upright
on
his
steed
with
his
face
turned
away
dan
looked
round
to
his
companions
with
a
meaning
look
as
much
as
to
say
what
does
the
body
mean
but
seeing
that
he
sat
still
in
the
act
of
listening
he
proceeded

a

the
stern
abbot
gave
a
glance
up
to
the
three
new
hills
of
eildon
that
towered
majestically
over
their
heads
but
it
seemed
rather
a
look
of
exultation
than
one
either
of
wonder
or
regret

for
aikwood
ho
for
aikwood
ho
shouted
dan
and
his
companions
as
they
took
the
rear
of
the
four
sable
dignitaries
and
striking
the
spurs
into
their
steeds
all
at
the
same
time
they
went
off
at
their
horses
utmost
speed
but
in
a
short
time
the
four
yeomen
were
distanced
the
black
steeds
and
their
riders
went
at
such
a
pace
as
warrior
had
never
before
witnessed
up
by
the
side
of
they
sped
with
the
most
rapid
velocity
over
mire
over
ditch
over
ford
without
stay
or
stumble
dan
and
his
companions
posted
on
behind
sparing
neither
whip
nor
spur
for
they
were
affronted
that
these
gownsmen
should
display
more
energy
in
their
master
cause
and
the
cause
of
his
friends
than
they
should
do
themselves
but
their
horses
floundered
and
blew
and
snorted
and
puffed
and
whisked
their
tails
with
a
whistling
sound
and
still
lagged
farther
and
farther
behind
come
come
callants
cried
dan
to
his
companions
let
us
rein
up
these
bedesmen
horses
are
ower
weel
fed
for
our
nags
they
fly
like
the
wind
od
we
may
as
weel
try
to
ride
wi
the
devil
whisht
whisht
said
will
martin
i
dinna
like
to
mak
ower
familiar
wi
that
name
we
never
ken
wha
hearing
us
in
this
country
they
were
nigh
to
the
heights
when
these
words
passed
and
the
four
black
horsemen
perceiving
them
to
take
it
leisurely
they
paused
and
wheeled
about
and
the
majestic
primate
taking
off
his
cornuted
chaperon
waved
it
aloft
and
called
aloud
for
shame
sluggish
hinds
why
wo
you
speed
before
the
hour
of
prevention
is
lost
for
aikwood
ho
i
say
as
he
said
these
words
his
black
courser
plunged
and
reared
at
a
fearful
rate
and
as
our
troopers
thought
at
one
bolt
sprung
six
or
seven
yards
from
the
ground
the
marks
of
that
black
horse
hoofs
remain
impressed
in
the
sward
to
this
day
and
the
spot
is
still
called
abbot
at
least
it
had
been
so
called
when
isaac
the
curate
wrote
this
history
to
keep
clear
of
the
wood
that
was
full
of
thickets
they
turned
a
little
to
the
left
and
pursued
their
course
and
the
ground
becoming
somewhat
firmer
our
yeomen
pursued
hard
after
them
but
on
coming
over
the
steep
brow
of
a
little
hill
the
latter
perceived
a
mountain
lake
of
considerable
extent
that
interrupted
their
path
and
to
their
utter
astonishment
the
four
black
horsemen
going
straight
across
it
at
about
the
same
rate
that
the
eagle
traverses
the
firmament
the
loch
is
frozen
and
bears
over
said
dan
let
us
follow
them
across
the
loch
is
frozen
indeed
said
will
martin
but
ony
man
may
see
that
ice
winna
bear
a
cat
haud
your
tongue
you
gouk
said
dan
do
ye
think
the
thing
that
bore
them
winna
bear
us
and
as
he
spurred
foremost
down
the
steep
he
took
the
lake
at
the
broad
side
but
the
ice
offering
no
manner
of
resistance
horse
and
man
were
in
one
moment
out
of
sight
the
sable
horsemen
on
the
other
side
shouted
with
laughter
and
called
aloud
to
the
troopers
to
venture
on
and
haste
forward
for
the
ice
was
sufficiently
strong
the
bold
trooper
and
his
horse
were
extricated
with
some
difficulty
and
the
monks
testifying
the
utmost
impatience
he
remounted
dripping
as
he
was
and
not
being
able
to
find
the
passage
across
the
lake
on
the
ice
he
and
his
companions
gallopped
around
the
head
of
it
as
he
rode
the
morning
being
frosty
he
chanced
to
utter
these
words
but
i
be
a
which
words
says
isaac
gave
the
name
to
that
lake
and
the
hill
about
it
to
all
future
ages
and
from
those
perilous
days
of
witchcraft
and
divination
and
the
shocking
incidents
that
befel
to
men
adds
he
have
a
great
many
of
the
names
of
places
all
over
our
country
had
their
origin
the
dark
horsemen
always
paused
until
the
troopers
were
near
them
as
if
to
encourage
them
on
but
they
never
suffered
them
to
join
company
when
they
came
over
a
ridge
above
old
lindean
they
were
hard
upon
them
but
lost
sight
of
them
for
a
short
space
on
the
height
and
coming
on
full
speed
they
arrived
on
the
brink
of
a
deep
wooded
dell
and
to
their
utter
astonishment
saw
the
four
gownsmen
on
the
other
side
riding
deliberately
along
and
beckoning
them
forward
i
am
sair
said
will
martin
gin
thae
chaps
hae
nae
gaen
ower
the
cleugh
at
ae
bound
an
it
warna
for
their
habits
i
wad
take
them
for
something
nouther
good
nor
cannie
haud
your
tongue
or
else
speak
feasible
things
said
dan
can
the
worthy
father
lawrence
and
his
chief
priors
and
functionaries
ever
be
suspected
as
warlocks
or
men
connected
wi
the
devil
and
his
arts
if
sic
were
to
be
the
case
we
hae
nae
mair
trust
to
put
in
aught
on
this
earth
the
dell
maun
be
but
a
step
across
here
is
a
good
passable
road
come
let
us
follow
them
dan
led
the
way
and
they
dived
into
the
dell
by
a
narrow
track
rather
like
a
path
for
a
wild
goat
than
men
and
horses
however
by
leaping
sliding
and
pushing
one
another
horses
behind
they
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
and
perceiving
a
path
on
the
other
side
they
expected
to
reach
the
western
brink
immediately
but
in
this
they
were
mistaken
abrupt
rocks
and
impenetrable
thickets
barred
their
progress
on
every
side
and
they
found
it
impossible
to
extricate
themselves
without
leaving
their
horses
they
tried
every
quarter
with
the
same
success
and
at
the
last
attempted
to
ascend
by
the
way
they
came
but
that
too
they
found
impracticable
and
all
the
while
they
heard
the
voices
of
their
fellow
travellers
chiding
their
stay
from
above
and
shaming
them
for
their
stupidity
in
taking
the
wrong
path
at
one
time
they
heard
them
calling
on
them
to
come
this
way
here
was
an
excellent
and
when
the
toiled
yeomen
stuck
fairly
still
in
that
direction
they
instantly
heard
other
voices
urging
them
to
ascend
by
some
other
quarter
at
other
times
they
thought
they
heard
restrained
bursts
of
giggling
laughter
after
a
great
deal
of
exertion
to
no
manner
of
purpose
they
grew
they
neither
knew
what
to
do
nor
what
they
were
doing
and
at
last
were
obliged
to
abandon
their
horses
and
climb
the
ascent
by
hanging
by
the
bushes
and
roots
of
trees
when
they
emerged
from
the
deep
hollow
they
perceived
eight
black
horsemen
awaiting
them
instead
of
four
but
as
the
country
around
melrose
and
dryburgh
swarmed
with
members
of
the
holy
brotherhood
of
every
distinction
and
rank
the
troopers
took
no
notice
of
it
thinking
these
were
some
of
the
head
functionaries
come
to
wait
on
their
abbot
the
latter
chided
our
yeomen
in
sharp
and
resentful
language
for
their
utter
stupidity
in
taking
the
wrong
path
and
regretted
exceedingly
the
long
delay
their
mistake
had
occasioned
his
time
he
said
being
limited
as
was
also
the
time
that
his
power
prevailed
in
a
more
particular
way
over
the
powers
of
darkness
for
us
to
go
alone
added
he
would
signify
nothing
the
manual
labour
of
breaking
through
the
iron
gates
we
can
not
perform
therefore
unless
you
can
keep
up
with
us
we
may
return
home
by
the
way
we
came
i
am
truly
grieved
said
dan
at
our
misfortune
we
have
certainly
been
more
forward
than
wise
and
i
fear
have
marred
the
fairest
chance
we
will
ever
have
for
the
deliverance
of
our
friends
but
i
have
a
few
fellow
warriors
at
the
mill
who
will
accompany
you
for
a
word
of
your
mouth
i
beg
that
you
will
not
think
of
returning
for
the
case
brooks
no
delay
we
have
lost
our
horses
and
can
hardly
reach
the
castle
on
foot
before
it
be
evening
i
wot
not
what
we
shall
do
brethren
i
am
afraid
i
must
request
of
you
to
lend
these
brave
troopers
your
horses
said
the
abbot
to
the
four
last
comers
my
esteem
for
the
doughty
champion
of
my
domains
is
such
that
i
would
gladly
do
him
a
favour
o
thank
you
thank
you
kind
sir
we
are
mair
behadden
to
you
than
tongue
can
tell
said
dan
the
four
new
come
brethren
dismounted
at
their
abbot
request
and
without
taking
a
moment
to
hesitate
the
four
yeomen
mounted
their
horses
the
abbot
lawrence
charged
them
to
urge
the
steeds
to
their
utmost
speed
away
went
the
abbot
and
his
three
sable
attendants
and
away
went
the
four
troopers
after
them
but
from
the
first
moment
that
they
started
the
latter
lost
sight
of
the
ground
unless
it
was
as
they
thought
about
a
mile
below
their
feet
the
road
seemed
to
be
all
one
marble
pavement
or
sheet
of
solid
alabaster
there
was
neither
height
nor
hollow
in
it
that
they
could
distinguish
but
the
fire
flew
from
the
heels
of
the
horses
and
sparkled
across
the
firmament
like
thousands
of
flying
stars
the
velocity
at
which
they
went
was
such
that
the
borderers
could
not
draw
their
breath
save
by
small
broken
gulps
but
as
they
imagined
they
rode
at
such
an
immense
distance
from
the
ground
they
kept
firm
by
their
seats
for
bare
life
leaning
forward
with
their
eyes
and
their
mouths
wide
open
having
never
in
all
their
lives
rode
on
such
a
path
they
were
soon
convinced
that
they
could
not
be
riding
toward
aikwood
around
which
the
roads
were
very
different
they
often
attempted
to
speak
to
one
another
but
could
not
utter
any
thing
farther
than
one
short
sound
for
the
swiftness
with
which
they
clove
the
atmosphere
cut
their
voices
short
at
length
dan
perceiving
his
comrade
will
martin
scouring
close
by
his
side
forced
out
the
following
sentence
piecemeal
where
the
devil
are
we
gaun
now
straight
to
what
need
ye
speer
the
lord
for
for
for
bid
will
martin
was
the
reply
which
has
since
grown
to
a
proverb
on
they
flew
over
hill
over
dale
over
rock
and
river
over
town
tower
and
steeple
as
our
yeomen
deemed
but
they
might
deem
what
they
pleased
for
they
saw
nothing
except
now
and
then
the
tails
of
the
churchmen
gowns
flapping
in
the
air
before
them
however
they
came
to
their
goal
sooner
than
they
expected
and
that
in
a
way
as
singular
as
that
by
which
they
reached
it
the
miller
at
had
a
whole
hill
of
or
shealings
of
oats
thrown
out
in
a
heap
adjoining
to
the
mill
ere
ever
our
yeomen
knew
what
they
were
doing
from
the
time
they
mounted
they
were
all
lying
in
this
immense
heap
of
perfectly
dizzy
and
dumfoundered
and
setting
up
their
heads
from
among
them
with
the
same
sort
of
staring
stupid
attempt
at
consideration
as
the
heads
of
so
many
frogs
which
may
be
seen
newly
popped
up
out
of
a
marsh
the
bedesmen
were
of
them
to
the
end
of
the
course
and
drew
up
by
wheeling
their
horses
round
the
kiln
as
if
it
had
been
a
but
the
yeomen
horses
in
making
the
wheel
threw
their
riders
one
by
one
with
a
jerk
over
head
and
ears
among
the
loose
heap
of
seeds
and
galloping
off
around
the
corner
of
the
hill
they
never
saw
another
hair
of
their
tails
the
miller
came
running
out
from
his
mill
with
his
broad
dusty
bonnet
the
smoky
out
from
his
logie
the
came
skipping
from
the
as
white
as
lilies
the
rest
of
the
warden
men
and
the
four
sable
dignitaries
of
the
church
came
also
and
all
of
them
stood
in
a
ring
round
our
dismounted
troops
some
asking
one
question
some
another
but
all
in
loud
fits
of
laughter
their
wits
could
not
be
rallied
in
an
instant
and
all
that
they
could
do
or
say
was
to
blow
the
seeds
out
of
their
mouths
with
which
they
were
literally
filled
and
utter
some
indefinite
sentences
such
as
rather
briskish
yauds
these
same
may
the
like
o
mine
never
be
crossed
by
man
again
hech
but
they
are
the
gear
for
the
lang
road
what
become
o
them
i
wad
like
to
take
a
right
look
them
for
aince
do
ye
want
to
look
if
they
have
mark
o
mouth
will
you
may
look
at
some
o
these
that
came
foremost
then
yours
are
aff
wi
their
tails
on
their
rigging
there
are
some
cheated
if
ever
you
see
mair
o
them
will
martin
looked
at
the
abbot
horse
but
when
he
saw
the
glance
of
his
eye
he
would
not
have
taken
him
by
the
jaws
to
have
looked
his
mouth
for
all
christendom
the
four
sable
horsemen
led
the
way
and
all
the
yeomen
followed
on
foot
bearing
with
them
such
mattocks
as
they
had
been
able
to
procure
about
selkirk
that
morning
and
away
they
marched
in
a
body
to
aikwood
castle
that
was
a
blyth
sight
to
our
forlorn
and
starving
prisoners
even
gibbie
had
some
hopes
of
a
release
but
whenever
master
michael
scott
got
a
near
view
of
the
four
sable
equestrians
he
sunk
into
profound
and
gloomy
silence
and
every
now
and
then
his
whole
frame
was
observed
to
give
a
certain
convulsed
shake
or
shudder
which
can
not
be
described
the
rest
of
the
sufferers
supposed
it
to
proceed
from
his
rooted
aversion
to
holy
and
devout
men
but
they
were
so
intent
on
regaining
their
own
liberty
that
they
paid
little
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
he
was
affected
father
lawrence
bade
the
men
proceed
to
work
and
he
would
retire
into
an
inner
chamber
and
exercise
himself
so
as
to
keep
from
them
all
sorts
of
interruption
from
spirits
of
whatever
denomination
and
he
pledged
himself
for
their
protection
they
thanked
him
and
hasted
to
execute
their
design
nor
were
they
long
in
accomplishing
it
by
the
help
of
huge
scaling
hammers
they
broke
down
a
part
of
the
narrow
and
actually
set
their
friends
at
liberty
but
the
abbot
enjoined
them
in
nowise
to
depart
or
to
do
any
thing
contrary
to
the
desire
of
the
mighty
master
while
they
remained
in
his
premises
else
he
could
not
answer
for
the
consequences
this
our
yeomen
readily
assented
to
and
undertook
to
prevail
with
their
friends
to
acquiesce
in
the
same
measure
as
soon
as
the
was
forced
the
abbot
lawrence
sent
one
of
his
officers
to
desire
master
michael
scott
to
come
and
speak
to
him
privately
in
the
secret
chamber
the
wizard
looked
at
the
messenger
as
a
sovereign
does
to
a
minister
of
whom
he
is
afraid
or
a
master
to
a
slave
who
he
knows
would
assassinate
him
if
he
could
nevertheless
he
rose
and
followed
him
to
his
superior
what
passed
between
these
two
dignified
characters
it
is
needless
here
to
relate
as
the
substance
of
the
matter
will
appear
in
the
sequel
but
the
master
returned
into
the
great
hall
where
the
warden
men
were
by
that
time
all
assembled
an
altered
man
indeed
his
countenance
glanced
with
a
sublime
but
infernal
exultation
his
eye
shone
with
ten
times
the
vigour
of
youthful
animation
it
was
like
a
dying
flame
relumined
that
flashes
with
more
than
pristine
brightness
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
like
those
of
a
conqueror
on
the
field
of
battle
with
this
voice
and
with
this
mien
he
ordered
the
friar
and
his
ward
delany
instantly
to
quit
the
castle
and
if
an
hour
hence
they
were
found
on
his
domains
he
would
cause
them
to
be
hewed
into
so
many
pieces
as
there
were
hairs
on
their
heads
lo
thy
threats
are
unto
me
as
the
east
wind
said
the
friar
yea
as
the
wind
that
cometh
from
the
desert
and
puffeth
up
the
vapours
on
the
stagnant
pools
of
water
if
my
companions
in
adversity
go
then
will
i
also
go
along
with
them
but
if
they
remain
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
so
likewise
will
thy
servant
and
what
hast
thou
more
to
say
thou
man
of
belial
the
master
shook
his
grey
locks
and
his
dark
silvery
beard
in
derision
and
charlie
scott
whose
confidence
in
his
friend
the
friar
was
now
unbounded
stepped
up
to
back
what
he
had
said
and
to
protest
against
parting
company
dan
however
interfered
hastily
and
told
them
he
was
bound
by
a
promise
to
the
holy
father
who
had
wrought
their
liberty
to
do
nothing
adverse
to
the
will
of
the
master
while
they
remained
in
his
castle
and
on
his
domains
and
therefore
he
begged
they
would
comply
without
more
words
and
without
delay
the
friar
then
consented
much
against
charlie
inclination
and
taking
delany
by
the
hand
he
said
lo
i
will
even
depart
but
i
will
remain
at
the
ford
of
until
my
friends
arrive
for
then
am
i
from
off
the
territory
of
this
blasphemer
and
worker
of
all
manner
of
iniquity
see
that
you
tarry
not
at
the
wine
neither
let
your
eyes
behold
strange
women
that
it
may
be
well
with
you
so
the
two
went
away
and
did
as
they
had
said
the
friar
found
his
mule
in
good
keeping
and
he
remained
with
the
maid
in
a
cottage
at
the
fords
of
to
await
the
issue
of
this
singular
and
unfortunate
embassy
now
shall
i
have
my
will
and
do
that
which
seems
meet
to
me
said
the
master
as
he
strode
the
hall
with
unrestrained
energy
did
the
dolt
imagine
he
could
with
his
tricks
of
legerdemain
outdo
me
in
the
powers
and
mysteries
of
my
art
no
that
man
is
unborn
let
him
go
with
his
crosiers
and
his
breviaries
i
am
michael
scott
once
again
it
is
needless
to
say
ought
here
said
charlie
scott
aside
to
his
companions
fock
should
ken
weel
what
they
say
and
where
they
are
saying
it
but
the
truth
is
that
the
friar
was
the
greatest
man
the
twa
and
that
auld
birkie
was
right
sair
cowed
in
his
presence
it
is
sair
against
my
will
that
we
hae
been
obliged
by
your
promise
dan
to
part
wi
the
gospel
friar
for
d
ken
i
feel
amaist
as

carl

a
steward
a
perfect
hound
o
hell
wha
thought
to
guide
us
waur
than
dogs
and
he
crossed
the
friar
unco
sair
till
at
length
he
lost
a
patience
wi
him
and
lord
sauf
us
sent
him
up
through
the
clouds
in
a
flash
o
fire
and
there

and
every
thing
will
now
be
settled
in
the
most
amicable
manner
that

his
assistants

the
only
hope
i
hae

it
warna
for
their
presence
i

half
hour
in
sic
a
place
as

what
scenes

embassage
i
will
gang

a
high
key
master
michael
scott
ye
ken
that
yoursel
and
our
auld
friar
by
your
trials
o
skill
in
your
terrible
arts
o
witchcraft
brought
about
an
accident
that
has
kept
us
ower
lang
here
to
the
great
trouble
and
inconveniency
of
our
captain
your
own
brave
kinsman
now
since
we
are
a
at
liberty
again
we
beseech
you
to
give
us
our
answer
and
if
you
canna
read
the
weird
that
he
desires
of
you
why
tell
us
sae
at
aince
and
let
us
gang
about
our
business
gallant
yeoman
your
request
shall
be
granted
without
loss
of
time
said
the
master
but
it
is
the
venerable
father
request
that
i
should
regale
my
kinsman
people
before
dismissing
them
to
make
some
small
return
for
the
privations
they
have
suffered
be
satisfied
then
to
remain
for
a
few
hours
till
you
taste
of
my
cheer
and
in
the
meanwhile
i
will
look
into
the
book
of
fate
and
not
only
tell
you
what
your
captain
sir
ringan
ought
to
do
but
i
will
show
you
demonstratively
what
he
do
if
he
would
succeed
in
raising
his
name
and
his
house
above
that
of
every
scottish
baron
thank
ye
noble
sir
said
charlie
there
shall
never
be
another
word
about
it
if
we
gain
our
errand
sae
satisfactorily
at
last
i
count
that
we
bidden
weel
wared
noble
and
worthy
sir
you
never
yet
have
said
who
told
the
most
efficient
tale
and
unto
whom
the
maiden
should
belong
said
the
poet
was
he
your
captain
there
who
said
the
tale
i
most
approved
and
to
him
i
award
my
right
in
the
toy
the
trifle
you
call
maiden
returned
the
master
and
it
is
well
remembered
squire
amongst
you
you
deprived
me
of
my
steward
a
man
that
could
have
accomplished
a
great
deal
i
therefore
claim
this
worthy
in
his
stead
as
agreed
and
glad
may
he
be
that
he
escapes
so
well
i
fear
i
will
be
a
bad
cook
and
an
awkward
valet
said
gibbie
i
was
never
very
handy
at
ought
that
way
tam
wad
answer
a
great
deal
better
an
it
were
your
will
we
will
have
you
taught
practically
and
to
profit
said
the
master
the
three
brethren
attendants
on
father
lawrence
shall
take
you
to
task
this
instant
they
will
act
as
your
assistants
and
masters
and
to
their
hands
i
recommend
you
be
expert
and
spare
no
cost
so
saying
he
gave
three
tramps
with
his
heel
as
he
was
wont
to
do
in
time
past
and
instantly
the
three
sable
monks
stood
before
him
take
that
comely
youth
said
he
and
bestow
on
him
a
few
cogent
lessons
in
the
mysteries
of
the
culinary
art
you
may
teach
him
a
few
as
he
said
this
there
was
a
malignant
smile
rather
darkened
than
lighted
up
his
stern
features
and
on
the
instant
the
three
monks
had
gibbie
from
the
ground
and
one
holding
by
each
arm
and
another
by
both
his
feet
they
rushed
out
of
the
hall
with
him
in
the
same
way
that
one
drives
a
wheelbarrow
when
the
men
of
the
embassy
heard
the
three
tramps
and
the
words
about
the
varieties
they
looked
at
one
another
with
rather
uneasy
sensations
but
the
presence
of
father
lawrence
and
the
other
three
holy
brethren
encouraged
them
still
to
acquiesce
in
the
master
request
a
short
time
after
this
as
they
were
sauntering
about
the
castle
they
heard
some
loud
giggling
laughter
intermixed
with
squeaking
cries
of
despair
which
last
they
could
well
distinguish
as
proceeding
from
the
lungs
of
poor
gibbie
jordan
and
immediately
after
that
there
came
among
them
a
huge
red
capon
fluttering
and
screaming
in
a
most
desperate
and
deplorable
manner
and
all
the
three
monks
pursuing
him
with
shouts
of
delight
the
feathers
were
half
plucked
off
him
and
his
breath
quite
spent
so
that
they
easily
laid
hold
of
him
and
carried
him
away
by
the
neck
to
have
him
spitted
living
as
they
said
our
yeomen
saw
nothing
but
an
overgrown
bird
but
they
heard
well
that
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
jordan
these
monks
are
trifling
and
amusing
themselves
said
tam
we
shall
get
no
dinner
before
night
the
words
were
hardly
well
said
when
the
castle
bell
rung
and
in
they
all
rushed
to
the
great
hall
where
stood
a
plentiful
dinner
smoking
along
the
board
and
the
abbot
and
the
master
both
seated
at
the
upper
end
side
by
side
our
yeomen
thought
it
extraordinary
to
see
the
great
warlock
and
the
reverend
father
in
such
close
compact
but
they
held
their
peace
the
abbot
rose
and
pronounced
a
blessing
on
the
food
but
it
was
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
little
did
they
wot
of
its
purport
there
was
great
variety
on
the
table
of
every
kind
of
food
yet
there
was
not
one
of
our
yeomen
knew
of
what
the
greater
part
of
the
dishes
consisted
but
the
huge
capon
stood
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
though
he
had
been
killed
and
cooked
in
a
few
minutes
the
bird
looked
exceedingly
well
the
abbot
and
the
master
devoured
him
with
so
much
zest
that
no
one
liked
to
call
for
a
piece
of
him
save
tam
craik
who
eat
a
wing
of
him
but
there
was
no
broad
bone
in
his
shoulder
yet
tam
declared
him
the
first
meat
he
had
ever
tasted
save
once
in
his
life
charlie
was
placed
next
the
master
and
dan
next
the
abbot
lawrence
the
three
monks
attendants
on
the
latter
served
the
table
but
nothing
of
the
new
steward
made
his
appearance
the
wine
and
other
strong
liquors
were
served
round
in
great
abundance
and
the
quality
was
so
excellent
that
notwithstanding
of
the
charge
every
one
drank
liberally
and
soon
got
into
high
glee
whenever
the
supreme
and
haughty
abbot
swallowed
a
cup
of
wine
dan
who
sat
next
him
heard
always
a
hissing
sound
within
his
breast
as
if
one
had
been
pouring
water
on
red
hot
iron
this
startled
the
trooper
terribly
for
two
or
three
times
at
first
but
his
surprise
lessened
and
wore
off
by
degrees
as
the
liquor
continued
to
exalt
his
spirits
the
feast
went
on
and
the
wine
flowed
but
as
on
a
former
occasion
the
men
ate
without
being
satisfied
the
wines
and
liquor
were
all
however
real
and
had
their
due
effect
so
that
the
spirit
of
hilarity
rose
to
a
great
height
it
was
observed
that
father
lawrence
conversed
with
no
one
but
the
master
and
the
dialogue
they
held
was
all
in
an
unknown
tongue
in
which
tongue
also
they
sometimes
conferred
with
the
servitors
the
master
left
the
table
three
several
times
for
he
had
a
charm
going
on
in
another
part
of
the
castle
and
at
the
third
time
returned
with
the
black
book
of
fate
the
book
of
the
dynasties
of
men
below
his
arm
and
laid
it
closed
on
the
table
before
him
now
my
brave
and
warlike
guests
said
he
before
i
open
this
awful
book
it
is
meet
that
every
one
of
you
be
i
ask
this
for
your
own
sakes
if
any
one
of
you
were
to
look
but
on
one
character
of
this
book
his
brain
would
be
seared
to
a
cinder
his
eyes
would
fly
out
of
their
sockets
and
perhaps
his
whole
frame
might
be
changed
into
something
unspeakable
and
monstrous
gude
faith
sir
master
i
haud
my
een
as
close
as
they
were
sewed
up
wi
an
elshin
and
a
lingel
said
charlie
so
said
they
all
but
they
were
not
trusted
the
monks
were
ordered
to
go
round
the
table
and
tie
every
one
eyes
closely
up
and
when
this
was
done
they
were
desired
to
lay
all
their
heads
down
upon
their
hands
on
the
board
and
to
sit
without
moving
whatever
they
might
hear
he
then
proceeded
to
open
the
massy
iron
clasps
and
as
soon
as
they
were
unloosed
three
spirits
burst
from
the
book
with
loud
shrieks
and
escaped
through
the
barbican
the
yells
were
so
piercing
that
some
of
our
yeomen
started
from
their
seats
but
dared
not
lift
their
heads
ah
they
are
gone
said
the
master
this
weird
will
cost
me
dear
fear
nothing
but
proceed
said
father
lawrence
he
opened
the
book
and
three
peals
of
thunder
ensued
that
shook
the
castle
to
its
foundations
every
one
of
them
louder
than
the
last
and
though
our
yeomen
sat
trembling
in
utter
darkness
they
heard
voices
around
them
as
if
the
hall
had
been
crowded
full
of
people
among
others
they
deemed
that
they
could
distinguish
the
voices
of
the
warden
and
his
lady
they
however
sat
still
as
if
chained
to
their
places
awaiting
the
issue
and
after
much
noise
and
apparent
interruptions
the
great
master
read
out
as
follows
he
for
whom
this
weird
is
read
be
he
son
of
battle
bred
be
he
baron
born
to
peril
be
he
lord
or
be
he
earl
let
him
trust
his
gallant
kin
and
the
sword
below
the
skin
when
the
red
buck
quits
the
cover
when
the
midnight
watch
is
over
then
whatever
may
betide
trust
the
horn
and
trust
the
hide
he
that
drives
shall
feel
the
gin
but
he
that
driven
shall
get
in
all
for
whom
this
weird
is
read
for
the
living
for
the
dead
from
the
chief
with
corslet
shorn
to
the
babe
that
is
unborn
let
them
to
the
sceptre
lean
till
the
place
where
they
have
been
see
their
sway
expand
untroubled
doubled
doubled
nine
times
doubled
first
to
rise
and
rule
the
rings
mixed
with
blood
of
mighty
kings
this
is
read
for
princes
peers
and
children
of
a
thousand
years
now
begins
their
puissant
story
strike
the
blow
and
gain
the
glory
rise
not
against
feudal
union
no
advance
but
in
communion
though
through
battle
broil
and
shut
the
book
and
read
no
further
the
book
was
closed
and
loud
shouts
of
applause
as
from
a
great
multitude
were
heard
at
a
distance
as
that
died
away
a
peal
of
thunder
burst
forth
over
their
heads
which
rolled
away
with
an
undulating
sound
till
lost
in
the
regions
of
the
western
heavens
our
yeomen
eyes
were
then
unbound
and
when
they
looked
up
the
book
of
fate
was
removed
and
the
master
was
fallen
back
on
his
seat
with
his
countenance
mightily
distorted
but
the
abbot
and
his
attendants
would
not
suffer
any
to
touch
him
till
he
recovered
of
himself
he
again
rose
into
high
and
unwonted
spirits
but
his
elevation
was
rather
like
the
delirium
of
a
man
driven
to
desperation
than
that
flow
of
delightful
hilarity
the
offspring
of
a
temperate
and
well
regulated
mind
the
borderers
persevered
in
their
libations
and
the
mirth
and
noise
increased
till
near
the
fall
of
the
evening
when
charlie
again
proposed
to
go
but
the
master
protested
against
it
for
a
short
space
adding
that
he
had
to
give
them
a
practical
lesson
how
their
captain
ought
to
proceed
if
he
would
be
the
greatest
man
in
scotland
this
was
quite
sufficient
to
prevail
on
yardbire
and
none
of
the
rest
appeared
much
disposed
to
move
about
this
time
some
of
our
yeomen
sitting
with
their
faces
toward
the
casement
beheld
a
novel
scene
which
they
called
up
the
rest
to
witness
this
was
the
master
new
steward
the
late
laird
of
the
peatstacknowe
making
his
escape
from
the
castle
with
all
possible
speed
he
was
stripped
half
naked
and
bareheaded
had
thrown
himself
over
the
outer
wall
lest
he
should
be
seen
going
by
the
gate
and
was
running
up
the
hollow
of
aikwood
burn
among
the
trees
to
elude
discovery
presently
afterwards
they
beheld
two
of
the
monks
stretching
after
him
with
a
swiftness
not
to
be
outrun
poor
gibbie
was
soon
overhied
and
brought
back
not
in
the
most
gentle
manner
and
instead
of
carrying
him
round
by
the
gate
which
having
been
broken
up
stood
wide
open
they
took
him
by
the
heels
and
threw
him
over
the
wall
at
the
place
he
had
leaped
before
gibbie
gave
a
loud
squeak
in
the
air
as
he
came
over
the
wall
with
a
wheeling
motion
and
falling
on
the
other
side
every
one
believed
that
there
would
not
be
a
whole
bone
left
in
his
body
instead
of
that
he
sprung
to
his
feet
and
ran
across
the
court
saying
to
himself
i
tell
you
what
it
minds
me
o
hell
this
place
if
ever
there
was
ane
upon
earth
he
got
not
time
to
finish
the
sentence
till
he
was
again
seized
and
hauled
into
the
castle
master
michael
scott
i
protest
in
my
master
name
against
this
usage
of
a
leal
vassal
and
tiend
laird
said
charlie
the
comely
youth
is
mine
by
your
own
agreement
said
the
master
he
shall
be
well
seen
to
perhaps
i
shall
only
keep
him
for
a
season
until
better
supplied
be
content
the
matter
is
now
beyond
disputation
in
the
meantime
i
will
proceed
to
give
you
a
specimen
of
my
profound
art
of
which
you
have
now
seen
many
instances
and
also
of
my
esteem
for
your
captain
to
whom
you
will
be
so
good
as
repeat
this
he
then
went
away
to
his
arcana
and
brought
a
bason
of
liquor
resembling
wine
which
he
sprinkled
on
all
his
guests
in
small
proportions
and
taking
his
seat
beside
the
supercilious
abbot
the
two
sat
apparently
waiting
for
some
grand
metamorphosis
the
spell
powerful
as
it
was
had
not
the
effect
that
was
surmised
these
rude
warriors
of
a
former
age
had
principles
of
virtue
and
honour
in
their
natures
that
withstood
the
charms
of
necromancy
those
charms
before
which
noble
dames
cruel
laymen
and
selfish
clergy
sunk
down
confounded
and
overpowered
the
countenances
of
a
few
of
the
troopers
were
somewhat
changed
by
the
spell
assuming
thereby
a
sort
of
resemblance
to
beasts
but
this
their
associates
only
laughed
at
deeming
it
occasioned
by
the
drunkenness
of
the
individuals
affected
the
two
great
personages
at
the
head
of
the
table
viewed
the
matter
in
a
different
light
and
that
with
evident
symptoms
of
disappointment
they
comprehended
the
reason
for
they
knew
there
was
but
one
against
which
the
powers
of
darkness
could
not
prevail
and
after
holding
a
conversation
about
it
in
their
own
mysterious
language
they
set
about
the
accomplishment
of
their
desires
for
though
a
matter
of
no
great
avail
the
master
could
not
brook
to
be
baulked
in
any
of
his
works
of
divination
the
purport
of
this
conversation
was
what
the
master
had
once
proposed
before
that
the
men
must
be
made
accessory
to
their
own
transformation
and
in
this
project
he
forthwith
engaged
with
all
manner
of
earnestness
chapter
he
can
turn
a
man
into
a
boy
a
boy
into
an
ass
he
can
change
your
gold
into
white
moneye
your
white
moneye
into
brass
he
can
turn
our
goodman
to
a
beast
with
hoof
but
an
with
horn
and
chap
the
goodwife
in
her
cheer
this
little
john
barleycorn
the
plan
of
our
great
necromancer
was
no
other
than
that
of
pushing
round
the
wine
and
other
strong
intoxicating
liquors
to
the
utmost
extremity
and
it
is
well
known
that
these
stimulating
beverages
have
charms
that
no
warrior
or
other
person
accustomed
to
violent
exertions
can
withstand
after
indulging
in
them
to
a
certain
extent
the
mirth
and
argument
or
rather
the
bragg
of
weir
grew
first
obstreperous
afterwards
boisterous
and
unruly
and
several
of
the
men
got
up
and
strode
the
hall
with
drawn
swords
without
being
able
to
tell
with
whom
they
were
offended
or
going
to
fight
neither
the
master
nor
the
abbot
discouraged
this
turmoil
but
pushed
round
the
liquor
till
some
of
the
most
intimate
friends
and
associates
of
the
party
in
the
extravagance
of
intoxication
actually
wounded
one
another
and
afterwards
blubbered
like
children
for
vexation
while
they
were
all
in
this
state
of
unnatural
elevation
father
lawrence
got
up
and
addressed
himself
to
the
party
for
the
first
time
he
represented
to
them
by
striking
metaphors
the
uncertainty
and
toil
of
the
warrior
life
and
requested
all
such
of
them
as
loved
ease
freedom
and
independence
to
become
inmates
of
his
habitation
and
during
the
time
of
their
noviciates
he
promised
them
every
good
thing
several
of
them
pretended
to
snap
at
the
proffer
some
on
one
condition
some
on
another
but
when
he
presented
a
scroll
of
parchment
written
in
red
characters
for
their
marks
or
signatures
no
one
would
sign
and
seal
save
tam
craik
who
put
his
mark
to
it
three
times
with
uncommon
avidity
on
the
positive
condition
that
he
was
to
have
as
much
fat
flesh
as
he
could
eat
for
the
first
three
years
at
all
times
that
he
chose
by
day
or
by
night
when
matters
were
at
this
pass
and
our
brave
yeomen
could
with
difficulty
rise
to
their
feet
they
heard
a
chorus
of
sweet
and
melodious
music
approaching
which
still
drew
nearer
and
nearer
this
was
a
treat
they
little
expected
in
such
an
habitation
but
how
much
greater
was
their
surprise
when
the
was
thrown
open
and
there
were
ushered
in
thirty
of
the
most
lovely
maidens
that
the
eyes
of
men
had
ever
beheld
they
seemed
too
to
be
all
of
noble
lineage
for
they
were
dressed
like
eastern
princesses
rustling
in
their
silks
and
covered
over
with
dazzling
gems
the
master
welcomed
them
with
stately
courtesy
apologizing
for
the
state
of
his
castle
and
the
necessity
they
would
be
under
of
sitting
down
and
sharing
the
feast
with
warriors
who
however
he
assured
them
were
all
gallant
gentlemen
of
his
own
kin
and
some
of
them
of
his
own
name
the
splendid
dames
answered
that
nothing
on
earth
would
give
them
so
much
delight
as
to
share
the
feast
with
gentlemen
and
warriors
the
natural
protectors
of
their
helpless
sex
to
whom
it
should
be
their
principal
aim
to
pay
all
manner
of
deference
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
our
brave
yeomen
with
the
profound
respect
that
men
of
their
boisterous
occupation
always
pay
to
female
beauty
and
rare
accomplishments
started
all
to
their
feet
and
made
their
obeisance
but
the
worst
concern
for
them
was
that
they
could
not
stand
on
their
feet
some
of
them
propped
themselves
on
the
hilts
of
their
sheathed
swords
leaning
the
points
backward
against
the
wall
others
kept
a
sly
hold
of
the
of
the
comrade
next
to
him
and
a
few
of
whom
the
poet
was
one
and
tam
another
lost
their
balance
and
fell
back
over
the
benches
showing
the
noble
dames
the
soles
of
their
sandals
all
was
silence
and
restraint
and
a
view
of
no
group
could
be
more
amusing
for
though
our
heroes
were
hardly
able
to
behave
themselves
with
the
utmost
propriety
yet
they
were
all
endeavouring
to
do
it
some
keeping
their
mouths
close
shut
that
no
misbecoming
word
might
possibly
escape
from
their
lips
some
turning
up
their
white
faces
manifesting
evident
symptoms
of
sickness
and
some
unable
to
refrain
their
joy
at
this
grand
addition
to
their
party
the
first
breaking
up
of
the
conversation
was
likewise
extremely
curious
but
it
was
begun
in
so
many
corners
about
the
same
time
it
is
impossible
to
detail
it
all
will
martin
with
a
lisping
unbowsome
tongue
addressed
the
one
next
him
to
the
following
effect
fine
evening
this
noble
dame
do
you
account
this
so
very
fine
an
evening
gallant
knight
hem
hem
glorious
roads
too
most
noble
lady
paced
all
with
marble
you
know
hem
came
you
by
the
marble
path
fair
lady
hem
hem
not
by
the
marble
path
most
courteous
knight
but
on
one
of
alabaster
bordered
with
emeralds
rubies
and
diamonds
you
know
hem
hem
may
all
the
powers
hem
powers
of
beauty
you
know
ay
hem
and
love
hem
what
was
i
about
to
say
could
not
guess
knight
that
smile
is
so
sweet
will
such
an
hem
such
an
angelic
creature
really
con
descend
to
converse
familiarly
with
a
plain
homely
warrior
your
notice
does
me
far
too
much
honour
worthy
knight
and
so
saying
she
put
the
tip
of
her
palm
gently
on
the
warrior
rough
hand
intoxicated
as
will
was
with
wine
he
was
petrified
with
astonishment
and
delight
and
could
not
find
terms
to
express
his
gratitude
and
adoration
many
others
were
likewise
by
the
same
time
testifying
by
their
bright
and
exulting
looks
the
joy
and
delight
they
were
experiencing
in
the
conversation
of
those
most
beautiful
and
refined
of
all
earthly
objects
tam
craik
beheld
or
thought
he
beheld
his
lovely
kell
among
them
blooming
in
tenfold
loveliness
he
was
so
drunk
that
he
could
not
articulate
one
syllable
but
he
fixed
his
long
and
grey
eyes
steadily
in
the
direction
of
her
face
and
put
his
hand
below
the
table
and
scratched
still
the
cup
and
the
cates
circulated
without
any
respite
the
master
and
the
abbot
both
called
them
round
and
round
and
though
the
lovely
and
dames
tasted
sparingly
nevertheless
the
circumstance
of
their
having
touched
the
cup
with
their
lips
was
sufficient
to
induce
the
enamoured
warriors
to
drink
to
them
in
healths
deep
and
dangerous
reason
had
long
been
tottering
on
her
throne
with
the
best
of
them
but
these
amorous
draughts
of
homage
overthrew
her
completely
and
laid
her
grovelling
in
the
dust
the
heroes
fell
from
their
seats
first
by
ones
but
ere
the
last
in
threes
and
fours
still
the
courteous
and
sympathetic
beauties
tried
to
administer
comfort
and
assistance
to
their
by
holding
up
their
heads
and
chafing
their
temples
but
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
total
oblivion
of
passing
events
ensued
to
the
whole
of
our
incautious
troopers
the
next
morning
presented
a
scene
in
the
great
hall
of
aikwood
which
if
it
can
not
be
described
neither
can
it
ever
be
conceived
there
lay
our
troop
of
gallant
yeomen
as
good
as
ever
heaved
buckler
scattered
over
the
floor
some
in
corners
some
below
benches
every
one
of
their
eyes
sealed
in
profound
slumber
though
the
day
was
well
advanced
and
every
one
having
an
inamorata
in
his
arms
or
clinging
close
to
him
of
her
own
accord
at
a
given
signal
the
great
bell
of
the
castle
was
rung
with
a
knell
that
might
have
wakened
the
dead
the
sleepers
raised
their
drowsy
and
aching
heads
all
at
the
same
time
and
as
was
natural
every
one
turned
his
eyes
first
toward
the
partner
of
his
slumbers
their
sensations
may
be
in
some
measure
conceived
when
instead
of
the
youthful
blooming
angelic
beings
whom
they
had
seen
there
lay
a
group
of
the
most
horrible
hags
that
ever
opened
eyes
on
the
light
of
day
instead
of
the
light
flowing
and
curled
hair
there
hung
portions
of
grey
dishevelled
locks
instead
of
the
virgin
bloom
of
the
cheek
and
the
brilliant
enamel
of
the
eye
all
was
rheum
haggardness
and
deformity
some
had
two
or
three
long
pitted
teeth
of
the
colour
of
amber
some
had
none
their
lovely
mouths
were
adorned
with
curled
and
silvery
mustachios
and
their
fair
necks
were
shrivelled
and
seriated
like
the
bark
of
a
instead
of
the
rustling
silks
and
dazzling
jewels
they
were
all
clothed
in
noisome
rags
and
to
crown
the
horror
of
our
benumbed
and
degraded
bacchanalians
every
one
of
the
witches
had
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
partner
gleaming
with
hellish
delight
at
the
state
to
which
they
had
reduced
themselves
and
the
horrors
of
their
feelings
the
poet
and
two
or
three
others
fell
into
convulsions
and
all
of
them
turned
away
groaning
and
hid
their
faces
from
these
objects
of
abhorrence
the
master
came
with
his
enchanted
liquor
once
more
and
sprinkled
it
over
the
prostrate
and
humbled
group
who
were
now
in
that
state
of
mental
agony
that
rendered
them
indifferent
to
aught
that
could
occur
and
as
he
sprinkled
them
he
said
to
himself
i
now
have
the
power
over
you
though
you
had
been
seven
times
anointed
in
holy
church
aye
seven
times
seven
said
a
tremendous
voice
and
the
words
were
followed
by
a
laugh
that
shook
the
vault
of
the
hall
which
laugh
was
echoed
by
three
or
four
accordant
voices
and
afterwards
by
all
the
witches
in
the
apartment
the
astounded
warriors
again
raised
their
heads
and
beheld
their
friend
the
abbot
stalking
along
and
along
the
hall
in
the
midst
of
them
in
majesty
sublime
he
wore
the
same
sable
and
flowing
robes
and
the
same
mitre
that
he
did
on
the
preceding
day
but
he
was
now
striding
openly
in
his
own
character
with
his
legs
shagged
and
hairy
shaped
like
those
of
a
goat
and
his
feet
cloven
into
two
distinct
and
horny
hoofs
the
three
attendants
were
there
also
but
they
were
no
more
three
monks
but
the
identical
prig
prim
and
pricker
the
infernal
pages
of
master
michael
scott
in
short
our
yeomen
discovered
to
their
utter
despair
that
they
had
been
riding
eating
and
drinking
hand
to
fist
with
the
devil
in
before
giving
any
of
them
time
to
recover
their
senses
he
strode
up
to
dan
chisholm
and
stooping
over
him
with
exultation
he
said
did
not
i
tell
you
christian
droich
when
i
bayed
you
at
the
mill
that
i
would
be
before
hand
with
you
at
melrose
and
have
not
i
kept
my
word
as
he
said
these
words
dan
once
more
saw
down
his
throat
and
beheld
the
burning
flame
within
with
fright
he
threw
himself
back
on
the
floor
and
held
up
one
foot
and
one
hand
as
his
last
inefficient
defence
on
which
his
infernal
majesty
vomited
such
a
torrent
of
sparkling
flame
out
upon
him
and
his
forlorn
partners
that
they
lost
all
hope
of
ever
again
moving
from
the
place
where
they
were
take
heart
my
brave
fellows
said
the
master
this
great
primate
you
see
is
no
other
than
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
great
controller
of
the
mighty
elements
who
has
honoured
us
with
his
company
you
are
now
in
his
power
and
lie
at
his
mercy
but
he
is
more
of
a
gentleman
than
he
is
generally
represented
to
be
and
will
scorn
to
take
advantage
of
a
few
poor
insignificant
creatures
who
call
themselves
christians
of
whose
company
he
is
sure
before
he
wants
it
he
knows
you
will
fume
and
bully
and
fight
for
a
few
short
years
sending
one
another
home
to
his
ample
mansions
in
myriads
before
your
time
both
he
and
i
would
scorn
to
take
farther
advantage
of
beings
so
blind
ignorant
and
inconsistent
than
suits
our
own
amusement
we
only
love
to
mock
you
show
you
your
own
littleness
and
how
easy
a
prey
you
would
be
were
there
a
being
in
the
universe
that
watched
for
ever
over
your
destruction
cheer
up
gallant
soldiers
and
now
for
the
developement
of
mighty
moment
i
will
show
you
the
manner
and
very
mode
by
which
your
captain
must
only
hope
to
succeed
in
his
great
enterprise
he
then
touched
every
one
of
them
with
the
that
was
in
his
hand
pronouncing
at
the
same
time
some
mystic
words
which
none
of
them
comprehended
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
witches
rushed
from
the
hall
and
as
soon
as
he
had
touched
the
hindmost
he
himself
also
made
his
escape
and
looked
from
a
crevice
of
an
inner
wall
the
enchantment
began
immediately
to
take
effect
the
warriors
rolled
about
on
the
floor
in
strong
convulsions
bellowing
and
flouncing
trying
always
to
run
on
and
then
tumbling
over
again
at
length
their
noses
and
chins
began
to
grow
forward
in
hideous
disproportion
till
their
heads
began
to
assume
something
of
the
forms
of
the
heads
of
beasts
and
liker
to
those
of
calves
than
any
things
else
the
laughter
that
pealed
from
crevice
and
barbican
was
at
this
eventual
period
excessive
the
devil
the
three
wicked
spirits
the
great
enchanter
and
his
conventicle
of
witches
seemed
all
to
be
in
convulsions
at
witnessing
how
the
metamorphosed
champions
shook
their
long
heads
looked
at
one
another
and
tried
to
speak
how
their
language
changed
from
words
half
pronounced
to
downright
confused
bellowings
and
how
their
forms
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
gradually
assumed
those
of
as
many
mighty
and
ferocious
bulls
i
have
now
given
you
your
own
proper
shapes
and
showed
you
in
frames
suited
to
your
natures
cried
the
master
from
a
crevice
pass
forth
and
be
gone
and
carry
my
respects
to
your
captain
then
there
was
a
combined
bellow
of
rage
arose
in
the
hall
that
would
have
rent
any
castle
to
the
top
but
that
of
aikwood
and
benches
boards
and
couches
flew
about
in
flinders
on
the
horns
of
the
furious
monsters
forthwith
they
rushed
out
into
the
great
court
and
from
that
to
the
side
of
the
hill
bellowing
and
tearing
up
the
ground
with
hoof
and
horn
till
the
country
was
alarmed
for
many
miles
round
and
believing
that
all
hell
was
broke
loose
from
the
castle
of
aikwood
that
day
they
betook
them
to
their
heels
and
fled
away
out
of
sight
and
out
of
hearing
the
outrageous
drove
looked
back
as
they
ascended
the
brae
to
the
eastward
of
the
castle
and
saw
the
devil
and
the
great
warlock
standing
on
the
topmost
tower
laughing
at
them
the
former
appearing
of
a
size
and
dimensions
equal
to
those
of
another
castle
the
grand
mitre
that
he
wore
on
his
head
shaped
like
a
crescent
to
conceal
his
horns
now
moved
like
a
cornuted
black
cloud
amid
the
firmament
his
eyes
glimmered
like
two
of
the
reddest
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
sceptre
that
he
waved
in
his
right
hand
was
like
a
tremendous
pine
all
in
flame
or
rather
like
a
burning
aerial
meteor
our
transformed
warriors
gallopped
away
in
terror
as
fast
as
cloven
hoofs
could
carry
them
with
one
mighty
bison
that
had
once
been
charlie
scott
far
of
all
the
rest
for
notwithstanding
of
all
that
charlie
had
seen
and
heard
in
favours
of
the
devil
he
felt
as
much
affrighted
for
him
as
ever
degraded
as
he
was
in
form
no
wonder
was
it
that
our
tumultuous
group
was
terrified
and
galloped
off
for
at
the
same
time
that
they
saw
satan
stretching
out
his
sceptre
in
his
right
hand
he
held
out
tam
craik
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
in
his
left
while
the
poor
fellow
was
seen
sprawling
and
spurning
the
air
over
an
unfathomed
void
when
the
made
his
retreat
from
among
the
warriors
that
morning
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
he
carried
tam
off
with
him
according
to
compact
fed
him
for
some
time
on
animal
food
of
the
richest
quality
which
never
once
satisfying
him
the
devil
grew
weary
of
such
a
voracious
cur
and
twisted
his
neck
about
the
drove
was
no
sooner
out
of
sight
than
the
master
said
to
one
of
his
pages
pricker
assume
thou
the
habit
that
thou
hadst
mount
and
ride
after
these
wild
cattle
and
deliver
them
over
to
the
charge
of
their
dolt
of
a
confessor
he
will
try
to
rescue
them
from
their
present
degraded
and
brutal
forms
but
he
will
not
be
able
spirit
thou
sawest
a
part
of
the
charms
performed
give
him
the
proper
directions
how
to
find
it
out
before
leaving
him
it
boots
nothing
offending
my
kinsman
the
warden
pricker
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
straight
for
the
fords
of
where
he
knew
the
friar
was
awaiting
his
companions
and
meant
to
have
driven
them
all
up
before
him
to
the
cottage
door
where
the
friar
and
his
fair
ward
sojourned
and
there
delivered
them
over
to
the
care
of
these
two
as
a
present
of
fine
beeves
from
the
great
master
to
sir
ringan
redhough
but
before
the
infernal
page
overtook
them
they
were
all
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
bellowing
and
kneeling
and
trying
in
vain
to
make
their
hard
case
known
to
the
friar
pricker
came
up
and
saluted
the
friar
who
observing
his
clerical
habit
returned
the
compliment
in
a
hurried
and
careless
manner
for
he
was
confounded
by
the
arrival
of
so
many
mad
bulls
reverend
brother
mine
said
the
page
i
deliver
over
into
thy
charge
this
herd
of
beautiful
cattle
the
best
breed
that
ever
roamed
the
forests
of
caledon
they
are
a
present
from
master
michael
scott
to
his
cousin
the
warden
of
the
middle
marches
see
that
you
deliver
them
safe
and
sound
lo
thou
seest
with
thine
eyes
and
thou
also
hearest
with
the
hearing
of
the
ear
said
the
friar
that
the
creatures
are
outrageous
and
not
to
be
governed
by
the
hand
of
a
single
man
and
thinkest
thou
a
brother
of
the
holy
order
of
benedict
would
take
a
goad
in
his
hand
and
ride
forth
after
these
bulls
of
bashan
lo
would
they
not
even
run
headlong
upon
my
mule
and
thrust
their
horns
into
his
side
thy
servant
also
and
this
maiden
would
they
tread
under
their
feet
go
to
thou
speakest
as
one
lacking
understanding
i
give
them
in
charge
to
thee
as
desired
by
one
with
whom
it
is
dangerous
to
contend
said
the
page
and
alongst
with
them
this
request
that
your
captain
will
make
away
with
them
as
quickly
as
possible
for
food
to
his
army
at
these
words
of
the
apparent
sacristan
there
was
such
a
roaring
and
bellowing
commenced
among
the
herd
that
for
the
first
time
the
friar
began
to
suspect
some
horrid
enchantment
but
wist
not
what
to
dread
the
drove
turned
round
their
heads
to
the
speaker
shook
them
in
disapproval
of
what
he
had
said
and
joined
in
such
a
ferocious
roar
against
him
that
it
was
not
like
ought
the
friar
had
ever
witnessed
among
the
brute
creation
before
the
metamorphosed
troopers
however
knew
too
well
now
who
pricker
was
to
attack
him
but
turning
again
round
they
came
in
a
row
and
kneeled
around
the
friar
looking
at
him
with
the
most
supplicating
expressions
of
countenance
that
ever
cattle
put
on
lo
methinks
i
have
looked
upon
these
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
in
some
of
the
days
that
are
past
said
the
friar
and
that
their
countenances
are
not
entirely
unknown
to
me
though
when
or
in
what
place
in
that
thing
my
memory
upholdeth
me
not
i
pray
thee
brother
to
declare
unto
thy
servant
where
thou
camest
by
these
beasts
of
mine
acquaintance
if
thou
art
a
follower
of
the
worthy
father
lawrence
thou
must
speak
the
tell
me
art
thou
a
christian
the
bulls
gave
not
the
infernal
page
time
to
reply
they
turned
about
shook
their
heads
and
tossed
the
earth
at
him
with
their
horns
raising
at
the
same
time
such
an
outcry
of
rage
against
him
that
the
friar
himself
was
afraid
and
retreated
within
the
door
of
the
cottage
and
he
thought
that
amid
their
confused
bellowings
he
could
distinguish
as
it
were
these
words
pronounced
he
a
christian
away
with
him
away
with
him
lo
what
am
i
to
understand
by
all
this
said
the
friar
come
near
unto
me
thou
man
of
mystery
that
comest
like
one
of
the
children
of
esau
with
thy
cattle
and
thy
herds
and
tell
unto
thy
servant
what
are
these
pricker
would
not
however
come
nigh
the
friar
but
still
kept
his
distance
for
against
the
friar
spiritual
armour
he
durst
not
engage
but
he
called
out
to
him
in
mockery
i
then
declare
unto
thee
o
thou
great
magician
who
camest
to
cope
with
the
prince
of
all
magicians
master
michael
scott
that
these
are
thy
master
yeomen
whom
thou
leftest
with
him
yesterday
now
what
sayest
thou
hast
thou
ever
witnessed
power
like
this
the
friar
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
tears
fell
down
on
his
dark
beard
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
cried
he
why
did
i
leave
my
children
in
the
lion
den
yea
even
in
the
den
of
the
great
lion
wo
is
me
that
this
breach
hath
been
made
among
the
followers
of
my
master
but
there
is
one
that
can
yet
controul
all
the
powers
of
darkness
and
to
him
alone
must
i
apply
without
delay
the
friar
went
instantly
to
his
devotions
and
performed
many
rites
of
a
nature
too
sacred
to
be
here
minutely
described
yet
after
all
his
exorcisms
the
men
could
not
regain
their
natural
shapes
but
lay
and
rolled
about
on
the
valley
in
awful
convulsions
the
hellish
page
who
had
kept
far
aloof
during
the
time
of
the
friar
sacred
appeal
now
came
galloping
near
to
enjoy
the
convulsions
of
the
herd
and
the
grief
and
astonishment
of
the
friar
and
after
mocking
for
some
time
in
obedience
to
the
great
wizard
command
he
called
to
the
friar
and
said
i
see
he
that
brought
about
this
wonderful
metamorphosis
for
which
you
shall
one
day
be
grateful
can
only
effect
the
look
into
the
manes
on
their
foreheads
and
look
narrowly
and
having
said
these
words
he
darted
off
towards
aikwood
with
the
speed
of
lightning
the
friar
did
as
this
flying
horseman
had
directed
and
searching
the
long
curled
mane
between
the
horns
of
the
first
monster
that
came
to
his
hand
he
there
found
stitched
a
small
scroll
of
parchment
neatly
rolled
up
and
written
in
blood
then
he
caused
them
to
bring
him
fire
in
which
he
burnt
it
and
presently
there
stood
up
at
his
hand
one
of
sir
ringan
redhough
warriors
in
all
his
arms
and
accoutrements
as
he
first
arrived
at
the
castle
of
aikwood
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
cried
the
friar
surely
this
excelleth
all
that
i
beheld
heretofore
the
spell
was
now
quickly
dissolved
but
no
pen
can
do
any
justice
to
the
feelings
of
our
amazed
troopers
as
they
again
strode
the
green
in
their
own
forms
and
vigour
embracing
the
friar
and
thanking
him
as
their
deliverer
they
returned
back
over
the
ridge
not
without
some
dreadful
apprehensions
to
the
mill
of
aikwood
for
their
horses
but
went
no
more
in
view
of
the
portentous
castle
they
found
their
horses
at
good
feed
and
whenever
charlie
saw
corby
skin
that
glittered
like
the
plumes
of
the
raven
he
cried
aha
corby
lad
ye
haena
wantit
either
meat
or
drink
ye
rascal
od
ye
hae
fared
better
than
your
master
ye
glooming
thief
stall
up
ye
dog
till
i
caparison
you
and
then
let
us
bound
for
the
border
but
the
most
curious
and
least
suspected
of
all
the
circumstances
attending
the
horses
was
that
dan
chisholm
horse
and
those
of
his
three
companions
that
they
left
stabled
in
the
deep
dell
above
lindean
were
all
found
standing
at
the
mill
among
the
rest
the
miller
could
give
no
farther
account
about
them
than
that
a
lad
brought
them
all
tied
to
one
another
tails
and
said
they
belonged
to
four
of
the
baron
of
mountcomyn
men
that
were
gone
to
aikwood
by
the
lord
soules
cried
dan
then
it
is
true
that
master
michael
scott
said
of
the
devil
being
more
of
a
gentleman
than
he
had
been
generally
represented
for
all
the
pranks
he
has
played
us
i
think
the
better
of
him
for
this
the
longest
day
i
have
to
live
what
say
you
to
this
friend
yardbire
i
shall
be
twenty
miles
off
aikwood
at
least
afore
i
speak
another
sentence
about
either
him
or
some
others
that
i
ken
o
mercy
on
us
poor
tam
craik
what
an
end
he
has
made
wi
his
fat
bacon
hech
but
it
be
a
despisable
thing
to
rin
open
mouth
to
the
i
no
mention
whae
for
their
greed
o
meat
some
may
hae
gotten
nae
mair
than
what
they
deserved
but
as
for
sachless
gibbie
jordan
he
has
been
right
hardly
dealt
wi
my
heart
unco
wae
for
the
poor
laird
and
i
think
something
should
be
done
to
recover
him
something
be
done
for
him
said
the
friar
and
that
of
such
momentous
consequence
that
if
his
own
iniquities
keep
him
not
in
bondage
all
the
powers
of
the
evil
one
shall
be
unequal
to
the
task
after
all
these
horrid
perils
of
weird
women
and
witchcraft
thus
miraculously
overcome
our
troop
rode
straight
on
to
the
camp
of
the
warden
and
found
him
in
the
vicinity
of
wooller
having
come
into
those
parts
to
counteract
the
rising
about
berwick
in
behalf
of
the
english
garrison
and
the
time
being
at
hand
on
which
he
must
either
do
or
not
do
either
join
with
heart
and
hand
in
the
cause
of
the
douglas
or
leave
him
to
stand
or
fall
by
himself
and
abide
by
the
consequences
his
impatience
for
the
return
of
his
men
from
aikwood
castle
had
been
commensurate
with
the
importance
that
he
attached
to
their
mission
but
when
they
informed
him
of
all
the
wonders
they
had
witnessed
and
the
transmutations
they
had
seen
and
undergone
how
the
warlock
and
his
spirits
had
raised
the
tempests
deluged
the
plains
levelled
the
forests
and
cleft
asunder
the
everlasting
mountains
the
baron
was
like
one
in
a
trance
it
was
long
before
they
could
make
themselves
accredited
or
impress
him
with
any
other
idea
than
that
it
was
a
story
made
up
to
astonish
him
with
the
feats
performed
by
the
friar
he
was
particularly
pleased
and
from
that
time
forth
paid
him
more
honour
than
he
had
ever
been
seen
pay
to
man
but
the
precise
meaning
of
the
destiny
read
for
him
out
of
the
book
of
fate
puzzled
and
interested
him
most
of
all
it
was
dark
and
full
of
intricacies
and
it
was
not
till
after
long
consultation
with
wise
men
as
well
as

we
have
now
performed
the
waggoner
difficult
and
tedious
task
with
great
patience
and
scarcely
less
discretion
having
brought
all
the
various
groups
of
our
up
to
the
same
period
of
time
it
now
behoves
us
that
is
isaac
the
curate
and
me
to
return
again
to
the
leading
event
namely
the
siege
of
roxburgh
the
state
of
mind
to
which
the
two
commanders
were
now
reduced
was
truly
pitiable
within
the
castle
of
roxburgh
all
was
sullen
gloom
and
discontent
in
one
thing
and
that
only
were
they
unanimous
which
was
in
a
frantic
inveteracy
against
the
scots
and
though
musgrave
with
the
feelings
of
a
man
would
gladly
have
saved
those
dearest
to
him
in
life
yet
he
found
that
to
have
proposed
such
a
thing
as
yielding
to
the
garrison
would
have
been
but
adding
fuel
to
flame
in
order
to
extinguish
it
their
small
supply
soon
began
again
to
wear
short
and
moreover
the
privations
to
which
they
were
subjected
had
brought
on
an
infectious
distemper
among
them
of
which
some
died
every
day
but
every
item
added
to
their
sufferings
fell
into
the
scale
against
the
scots
and
all
the
cruelties
exercised
by
the
latter
in
order
to
break
the
spirits
of
their
opponents
only
militated
against
themselves
opposition
to
the
last
man
was
a
sentiment
nursed
in
every
english
bosom
within
the
garrison
with
a
brooding
enthusiasm
of
delight
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
felt
intensely
for
their
gallant
captain
considering
the
dismal
situation
in
which
he
stood
with
respect
to
their
enemies
and
the
strong
hold
they
had
been
enabled
to
keep
over
his
heart
it
was
probably
the
burning
intensity
of
these
feelings
that
was
the
great
source
of
their
unhappiness
and
gave
rise
to
the
fierce
spirit
of
dissension
that
daily
manifested
itself
although
they
detested
the
deed
the
scots
had
committed
in
executing
sir
richard
yet
they
felt
his
death
a
sort
of
relief
as
by
it
of
the
cord
which
their
hated
adversaries
held
round
the
breast
of
their
commander
was
broken
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
they
wished
themselves
free
of
lady
jane
howard
by
fair
and
gentle
means
if
possible
but
at
all
events
to
be
rid
of
that
remaining
tie
which
almost
maddened
them
to
think
of
there
was
one
circumstance
which
of
late
was
to
all
of
them
wholly
unaccountable
as
the
day
of
the
conception
of
the
blessed
virgin
approached
the
mind
of
lord
musgrave
instead
of
becoming
altogether
deranged
as
they
had
foreboded
became
more
and
more
steady
and
collected
he
watched
over
every
part
of
the
economy
within
that
huge
fortress
and
gave
his
orders
with
punctuality
and
decision
although
with
a
degree
of
sternness
that
had
not
previously
been
observed
the
dreaded
day
of
the
conception
at
length
arrived
and
before
noon
crowds
of
the
citizens
and
people
from
the
surrounding
country
began
to
assemble
around
the
scottish
camp
these
were
forcibly
kept
beyond
the
line
of
circumvallation
while
the
regular
troops
were
drawn
up
in
columns
both
to
the
east
and
west
of
the
fortress
and
particularly
round
the
gibbet
on
the
at
eleven
the
scottish
trumpets
sounded
the
english
soldiers
crowded
to
the
battlements
around
the
western
tower
of
the
citadel
and
lord
musgrave
came
up
among
the
rest
arrayed
in
a
splendid
suit
of
light
armour
and
gallantly
attended
these
battlements
and
the
new
gibbet
were
as
before
stated
right
opposite
to
one
another
and
separated
only
by
the
breadth
of
the
moat
and
a
very
small
slope
on
the
western
ascent
so
that
every
object
could
be
distinctly
seen
from
the
one
place
to
the
other
and
by
raising
the
voice
somewhat
a
conversation
could
be
carried
on
across
at
the
very
time
that
lord
musgrave
thus
appeared
on
the
wall
the
lady
jane
howard
and
sir
musgrave
were
introduced
on
the
boards
of
the
gibbet
yes
read
it
over
again
i
say
sir
richard
musgrave
for
it
was
truly
he
the
douglas
seeing
that
he
could
not
prevail
and
that
the
gallant
youth
was
given
up
by
his
brother
and
the
english
to
his
fate
could
not
brook
the
idea
of
losing
by
his
death
the
of
the
influence
he
held
over
musgrave
but
that
he
might
try
it
by
stretching
it
to
the
very
last
he
clothed
another
culprit
in
sir
richard
habiliments
tied
a
white
cloth
over
his
face
let
him
stand
a
proclaimed
space
on
the
boards
with
the
cord
about
his
neck
and
at
the
last
moment
of
the
given
time
there
being
no
parley
sounded
for
the
delivering
up
of
the
keys
of
the
fortress
the
board
sunk
and
the
man
died
but
sir
richard
was
safe
in
hold
he
was
again
produced
that
day
being
the
eighth
of
december
along
with
lady
jane
he
was
dressed
in
the
suit
of
armour
in
which
he
fought
on
the
day
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
lady
jane
in
pure
robes
betokening
her
spotless
virginity
sir
richard
eye
beamed
with
manly
courage
but
the
fresh
hues
of
the
rose
on
the
cheeks
of
lady
jane
had
blenched
and
given
place
to
the
most
deadly
paleness
both
hosts
were
deeply
affected
with
the
sight
and
on
this
occasion
both
felt
alike
there
was
not
a
heart
amongst
them
that
did
not
overflow
with
pity
at
the
unhappy
fate
of
the
two
youthful
prisoners
whose
dismal
doom
could
now
no
longer
be
averted
unless
by
a
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
english
with
which
even
the
most
sanguine
of
the
beleaguering
army
doubted
their
compliance
the
douglas
then
caused
a
herald
to
make
proclamation
in
a
stentorian
voice
first
stating
the
cause
why
he
had
put
off
the
execution
of
sir
richard
musgrave
until
that
day
namely
his
anxious
desire
to
save
the
life
of
the
noble
youth
on
the
ground
that
the
purposed
holding
out
of
the
garrison
till
the
was
a
chimera
and
secondly
declaring
that
unless
the
keys
of
the
castle
were
previously
delivered
up
to
him
precisely
at
the
hour
of
noon
the
noble
and
gallant
sir
richard
the
flower
of
english
chivalry
should
be
put
down
and
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
jane
howard
the
betrothed
bride
and
devoted
lover
of
lord
musgrave
subjected
to
a
fate
the
most
humiliating
and
the
most
deplorable
that
ever
noble
maiden
suffered
and
that
in
full
view
of
both
armies
a
loud
murmur
of
detestation
sounded
from
the
walls
of
the
castle
but
the
columns
of
the
scottish
army
stood
and
looked
on
in
mute
and
tender
sorrow
lord
musgrave
placed
himself
right
opposite
the
prisoners
turned
his
face
straight
toward
them
and
gazed
with
an
unmoved
and
undaunted
air
sir
richard
addressed
him
in
the
same
sentiments
he
had
formerly
expressed
the
purport
of
which
was
it
will
be
remembered
the
madness
and
folly
of
holding
out
the
castle
now
when
the
bright
and
unequalled
prize
for
which
he
contended
was
lost
for
his
own
life
he
said
he
accounted
it
as
nothing
in
the
scale
but
the
fate
that
awaited
the
lady
of
his
love
who
had
shewn
such
devotion
to
his
person
and
interests
was
not
to
be
endured
or
permitted
by
any
knight
of
honour
lady
jane
cried
out
to
him
to
save
her
from
a
doom
before
which
her
whole
soul
shrunk
adding
that
she
had
done
much
and
suffered
much
for
him
and
would
he
not
make
one
effort
one
sacrifice
to
save
her
lord
douglas
cried
musgrave
will
not
a
formal
consignment
of
all
my
lands
titles
and
privileges
in
the
dominions
of
england
ransom
the
lives
of
these
two
not
if
they
were
ten
times
doubled
returned
the
douglas
nor
shall
any
earthly
thing
ransom
them
save
the
full
and
free
possession
of
the
castle
of
roxburgh
i
have
myself
suffered
a
loss
at
your
hands
of
which
you
are
not
aware
and
i
long
and
thirst
to
revenge
it
on
you
and
your
house
then
my
resolution
is
fixed
cried
musgrave
though
all
england
should
deprecate
the
deed
and
though
i
know
my
brethren
in
arms
disapprove
of
it
i
must
and
will
redeem
the
lives
of
these
two
yes
i
will
save
them
and
that
without
abating
one
iota
from
the
honour
of
the
house
of
musgrave
not
make
one
effort
lady
jane
not
one
sacrifice
to
save
your
honour
and
life
effort
indeed
i
will
make
none
but
an
effort
i
will
make
a
sacrifice
of
as
high
estimation
for
you
as
ever
knight
offered
up
for
the
lady
of
his
love
perhaps
it
may
not
be
in
my
power
to
save
you
but
in
the
sight
of
these
rival
armies
in
yours
my
only
brother
and
betrothed
bride
and
in
the
sight
of
heaven
i
offer
the
last
ransom
that
can
be
offered
by
man
as
he
said
these
words
he
flung
himself
headlong
from
the
battlement
of
the
western
tower
struck
on
the
mural
parapet
around
the
lower
platform
then
on
the
rampart
from
which
he
flew
with
a
rolling
bound
and
flashed
with
prodigious
force
into
the
ample
moat
there
by
the
weight
of
his
armour
he
sunk
forthwith
to
rise
no
more
the
troops
of
the
rival
nations
stood
aghast
with
uplifted
hands
gazing
on
the
scene
but
no
more
was
to
be
seen
of
the
gallant
musgrave
a
gurgling
boil
of
bloody
water
arose
above
him
as
he
sank
to
the
bottom
and
that
was
the
last
movement
caused
in
this
world
by
one
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
deeds
of
high
chivalry
and
restless
commotion
excepting
one
shriek
uttered
by
lady
jane
the
douglas
was
the
first
to
break
the
awful
silence
which
he
did
by
these
words
there
fell
a
hero
indeed
noble
and
resolute
musgrave
i
can
not
but
envy
you
such
a
chivalrous
fate
as
this
many
such
expressions
of
enthusiastic
admiration
burst
from
both
armies
not
in
shouts
of
applause
for
these
were
suppressed
by
sorrow
but
in
a
low
and
melting
pathos
that
bespoke
the
soul
regret
as
well
as
approval
when
these
first
expressions
of
feeling
were
over
the
dark
and
manly
countenance
of
douglas
sunk
into
more
than
usual
gloom
and
dejection
all
the
advantages
given
him
and
which
he
had
deemed
insurmountable
by
his
opponents
were
by
this
desperate
act
of
musgrave
extinguished
he
had
now
no
more
power
over
the
english
garrison
than
what
he
could
make
good
with
his
sword
and
his
bow
to
have
executed
his
threats
on
sir
richard
and
the
lovely
and
romantic
lady
jane
would
only
have
been
an
act
of
poor
and
despicable
revenge
which
would
have
disgusted
his
own
followers
and
could
in
no
degree
have
furthered
his
cause
so
he
ordered
them
back
to
confinement
with
directions
that
they
should
be
attended
according
to
their
rank
what
was
next
to
be
done
that
was
the
great
question
douglas
never
once
conceived
the
idea
of
giving
up
the
enterprise
for
though
the
princess
for
whom
he
had
undertaken
it
was
now
no
more
his
broad
domains
were
all
engaged
the
very
existence
of
the
house
of
douglas
depended
on
his
success
and
besides
the
king
had
more
daughters
though
none
like
his
beloved
and
accomplished
margaret
therefore
douglas
had
no
hesitation
regarding
the
necessity
of
taking
the
castle
he
was
determined
to
have
it
but
what
to
do
next
in
order
to
accomplish
this
determination
was
the
question
circumstances
were
grievously
changed
with
him
the
garrison
had
got
a
supply
across
the
during
the
time
of
the
flood
and
the
tempest
but
the
scots
could
not
ascertain
to
what
amount
sir
thomas
musgrave
had
been
joined
by
some
troops
from
the
shores
of
northumberland
and
had
issued
forth
with
these
and
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
of
berwick
to
the
amount
of
men
in
order
to
make
a
diversion
in
favour
of
the
garrison
of
roxburgh
this
movement
by
the
governor
of
berwick
disconcerted
the
douglas
most
of
all
a
party
of
these
marauders
had
shewed
themselves
on
the
height
about
hume
castle
with
trumpets
sounding
and
colours
waving
in
the
air
from
thence
they
marched
on
keeping
the
backs
of
the
hills
until
they
came
into
the
lower
parts
of
leaderdale
which
they
harried
burning
in
their
way
the
town
and
castle
of
ercildon
they
next
made
a
movement
towards
melrose
meaning
to
establish
themselves
in
the
rear
of
douglas
and
either
to
cut
off
his
supplies
or
force
him
to
abandon
the
siege
in
order
to
preserve
his
own
country
behind
him
but
when
they
came
to
the
river
tweed
they
were
opposed
by
the
brave
abbot
lawrence
not
the
feigned
and
infernal
abbot
that
our
yeomen
left
at
aikwood
but
the
real
worthy
and
apostolic
lawrence
himself
he
had
raised
all
the
abbey
vassals
and
retainers
and
shewed
fairly
disposed
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
english
over
the
river
in
the
meantime
he
posted
message
after
message
to
douglas
to
come
or
send
to
his
assistance
before
the
abbey
of
the
holy
virgin
with
all
its
sacred
stores
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
their
ruthless
enemies
douglas
was
hardly
put
to
it
if
he
drew
off
from
a
close
blockade
the
english
were
sure
to
take
advantage
of
his
absence
make
a
sally
and
procure
plenty
of
more
provisions
and
in
that
case
his
only
probable
hope
of
success
was
cut
off
on
the
other
hand
if
he
suffered
himself
to
be
inclosed
between
two
armies
his
situation
would
become
every
day
more
precarious
and
perhaps
in
the
issue
quite
untenable
he
was
therefore
in
a
manner
forced
to
the
resolution
of
making
an
effort
to
join
father
lawrence
and
of
giving
the
captain
of
berwick
battle
before
he
attained
possession
of
the
rich
monastry
of
melrose
the
time
was
now
arrived
when
the
support
of
sir
ringan
redhough
and
his
borderers
was
become
absolutely
necessary
without
their
in
a
more
close
and
decisive
manner
than
that
in
which
they
had
hitherto
conducted
themselves
he
could
not
now
proceed
one
foot
and
his
great
cause
was
ruined
he
therefore
dispatched
a
pressing
message
to
the
chief
conjuring
him
as
his
friend
and
either
to
come
and
supply
his
place
in
the
blockade
of
roxburgh
or
march
with
all
expedition
to
melrose
and
give
battle
to
the
governor
of
berwick
the
dogged
and
unyielding
warden
returned
for
answer
that
it
had
always
been
his
chief
and
undivided
aim
to
act
in
concert
with
his
noble
and
gallant
friend
and
lord
superior
the
earl
of
douglas
and
mar
but
that
he
had
a
peculiar
charge
from
his
sovereign
of
the
english
marches
which
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
attend
to
prior
to
all
other
considerations
whatever
he
could
do
conformable
with
this
first
duty
should
not
be
wanting
finally
he
sent
him
word
as
he
had
done
formerly
that
if
he
coudna
take
the
castle
and
confessed
that
he
coudna
take
it
he
might
send
word
to
him
and
he
wad
take
it
for
him
what
does
the
crabbed
carle
always
mean
by
that
answer
said
the
douglas
when
it
was
reported
to
him
perhaps
he
has
some
means
of
communication
with
those
within
the
fortress
some
secret
friend
in
disguise
among
our
enemies
perhaps
he
knows
of
some
weak
or
accessible
point
among
these
extensive
bulwarks
or
perhaps
he
reckons
on
some
plausible
means
of
surmounting
them
for
the
devil
head
is
not
more
fruitful
in
expedients
than
his
this
is
a
matter
of
such
importance
to
me
at
present
that
i
must
try
to
probe
it
to
the
bottom
were
i
sure
that
he
could
accomplish
his
boasted
feat
i
had
better
engage
him
to
it
with
of
my
dominions
and
at
all
events
i
must
procure
the
active
assistance
of
his
energetic
force
at
present
whatever
may
be
the
equivalent
required
let
my
white
stead
beaver
be
caparisoned
and
my
attendants
in
readiness
i
must
have
an
interview
with
this
man
of
the
mountains
before
i
sleep
the
warden
had
drawn
his
force
down
to
wooller
with
the
intention
of
more
effectively
with
the
douglas
he
had
heard
of
the
advantages
that
lord
held
over
his
adversaries
but
nothing
of
the
late
catastrophe
by
which
they
were
all
removed
deeming
therefore
that
the
chances
were
mainly
on
the
side
of
the
douglas
he
judged
it
his
safest
course
to
act
in
complete
concert
with
him
above
all
the
words
out
of
the
black
book
of
fate
had
been
conveyed
to
him
as
read
by
the
greatest
magician
in
the
world
from
all
that
could
be
made
out
of
that
mystic
rhyme
after
long
consultation
it
appeared
that
it
behoved
the
warden
and
his
friends
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
douglas
rise
not
against
feudal
union
no
advance
but
in
communion
were
words
hardly
to
be
misinterpreted
the
words
of
the
prophecy
and
the
ludicrous
metamorphosis
were
all
taken
into
account
compared
computed
and
over
again
computed
and
the
sequel
was
a
decisive
resolution
to
support
the
douglas
and
join
issues
with
him
but
in
the
meantime
to
make
the
most
of
a
bad
this
resolution
had
been
taken
and
so
far
acted
upon
that
trusty
agents
had
been
despatched
all
over
the
country
in
disguise
to
execute
a
portion
of
the
great
concerted
plan
when
the
douglas
at
a
late
hour
in
the
evening
arrived
in
the
warden
camp
he
then
had
proofs
experimentally
of
the
warden
caution
and
vigilance
he
came
upon
his
outposts
at
a
great
distance
from
the
main
body
of
his
army
these
withstood
his
passage
but
seeing
his
retinue
so
small
for
he
was
attended
only
by
two
knights
a
squire
and
a
guide
they
conducted
him
from
one
post
to
another
till
at
length
they
brought
him
completely
guarded
to
the
warden
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
lowly
cottage
at
wooller
the
doughty
chief
and
his
kinsmen
were
still
sitting
in
earnest
conversation
round
a
rustic
table
with
a
tremendous
torch
in
the
middle
of
it
this
was
nothing
less
than
a
huge
broken
jar
full
of
refined
ox
tallow
and
a
flow
peat
stuck
to
the
head
in
the
middle
which
being
kindled
emitted
a
blaze
like
a
fish
light
the
gallant
kinsmen
were
in
deep
consultation
anent
their
grand
plan
of
warlike
operations
and
the
more
they
conversed
about
it
the
more
eligible
did
it
still
appear
to
them
and
the
more
deeply
did
they
get
interested
in
it
so
that
when
the
knight
in
waiting
announced
a
stranger
who
requested
an
interview
with
sir
ringan
every
one
seemed
disposed
to
refuse
him
admission
tell
him
i
am
engaged
said
the
warden
o
yes
by
all
means
tell
him
we
are
engaged
said
dickie
dryhope
if
it
is
another
message
from
the
douglas
i
have
had
enough
of
him
said
the
warden
ay
faith
we
have
had
enough
of
him
said
dickie
it
is
perhaps
from
master
michael
scott
said
yardbire
or
maybe
himsel
wha
kens
lord
sauff
us
d
think
sae
said
the
warden
starting
to
his
feet
that
would
indeed
alter
the
case
ay
that
would
alter
the
case
indeed
said
dickie
starting
to
his
who
is
he
or
what
is
he
like
enquired
the
warden
ay
that
is
the
principal
thing
to
be
attended
to
said
dickie
what
is
he
like
he
is
delivered
as
a
knight
of
most
noble
bearing
and
courtly
deportment
answered
the
knight
in
waiting
i
suppose
we
must
admit
him
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
said
the
warden
again
taking
his
seat
o
yes
by
all
means
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
said
dickie
sitting
down
likewise
as
the
courtly
and
athletic
form
of
the
lord
douglas
came
up
the
hovel
the
border
gentlemen
stood
all
up
to
receive
him
save
sir
ringan
who
throwing
himself
back
on
his
seat
leaned
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
in
that
indifferent
posture
awaited
till
the
quality
of
his
guest
was
made
manifest
but
no
sooner
did
the
voice
of
douglas
reach
his
ear
than
he
rose
up
to
salute
and
receive
him
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
been
his
daily
visitor
you
are
hard
of
admission
noble
sir
ringan
said
he
thus
to
let
your
friends
wait
at
the
door
of
your
pavilion
after
riding
so
far
in
the
dark
to
see
you
i
am
chafed
with
visitors
from
both
countries
every
hour
of
the
day
lord
douglas
many
of
them
coming
with
complaints
which
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
rectify
i
have
therefore
a
sly
inquisition
established
around
me
that
might
haply
give
your
lordship
some
interruption
but
it
was
your
own
blame
had
you
announced
the
name
of
douglas
that
would
have
opened
a
lane
for
you
from
my
farthest
outpost
to
this
chair
which
i
request
you
to
occupy
while
i
take
my
place
here
at
your
right
hand
you
are
welcome
noble
earl
of
douglas
and
mar
to
our
rude
habitation
there
is
no
man
more
so
beneath
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
i
give
you
and
your
attendants
all
kind
welcome
and
greeting
you
are
become
as
much
an
accomplished
courtier
among
these
wild
wastes
as
you
were
before
an
accomplished
warrior
sir
ringan
said
douglas
i
always
make
points
of
speaking
as
i
am
spoken
to
drinking
as
i
am
drunk
to
and
going
to
a
battle
when
sent
for
said
the
warden
h
h
neighed
dickie
o
dryhope
screwing
up
his
mouth
on
one
side
like
a
shrew
it
is
all
true
our
captain
tells
you
lord
douglas
that
his
rule
mh
mh
mh
h
h
h
the
douglas
cast
at
dickie
a
curious
searching
glance
from
his
dark
eye
that
was
half
hid
by
a
shaggy
eyebrow
and
then
turning
to
sir
ringan
replied
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
noble
baron
of
mountcomyn
it
having
been
for
that
very
purpose
i
sought
this
interview
with
you
sir
ringan
redhough
you
must
to
battle
with
me
with
all
my
heart
my
lord
was
the
reply
come
that
is
as
it
should
be
we
no
more
of
it
we
have
no
more
of
it
said
douglas
let
us
have
a
flaggon
of
your
best
wine
to
drink
success
to
our
arms
the
wine
was
soon
produced
with
plenty
of
other
good
cheer
with
which
the
warden
camp
was
then
abundantly
stored
and
the
two
chiefs
conversed
together
with
as
much
freedom
and
as
little
apparent
jealousy
with
regard
to
rank
or
fame
as
if
they
had
been
two
brothers
the
douglas
delineated
his
affairs
as
in
that
posture
in
which
success
could
not
fail
him
at
the
same
time
he
admitted
the
ticklish
situation
in
which
he
stood
owing
to
the
diversion
made
by
the
captain
of
berwick
and
that
without
an
instant
effort
he
would
be
inclosed
between
two
fires
sir
ringan
answered
that
he
had
heard
of
the
incursion
and
therefore
he
had
drawn
his
troops
down
from
the
dales
of
northumberland
to
support
his
friend
and
firm
ally
in
any
case
of
necessity
and
he
concluded
by
boldly
proffering
either
to
supply
the
douglas
place
in
the
blockade
or
march
to
the
west
and
hold
sir
thomas
musgrave
in
check
douglas
was
delighted
to
find
the
crabbed
warden
as
he
was
wont
to
call
him
in
such
a
complaisant
humour
and
testified
that
delight
by
many
compliments
and
encomiums
on
his
vigilance
and
gallant
support
he
got
introduced
to
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
with
whom
he
exchanged
civilities
desiring
them
all
to
regard
him
as
their
friend
and
one
ready
to
do
them
a
kindness
whenever
it
lay
in
his
power
and
now
sir
ringan
since
you
hold
the
taking
of
the
castle
of
roxburgh
so
light
said
he
i
think
it
is
meet
that
my
men
and
i
should
march
and
give
battle
to
musgrave
probably
you
may
have
taken
possession
of
that
troublesome
garrison
before
we
return
if
i
do
my
lord
of
douglas
i
take
it
for
myself
replied
sir
ringan
and
claim
all
the
privileges
rights
and
immunities
that
were
to
devolve
on
you
as
the
reducer
of
it
now
if
i
should
take
the
castle
of
roxburgh
before
your
return
i
suspect
you
would
find
it
as
hard
work
to
expel
me
and
these
border
warriors
of
mine
as
the
english
that
you
have
there
already
i
have
all
these
brave
fellows
to
hold
in
beef
and
malt
my
lord
of
douglas
and
for
their
sakes
i
have
laid
down
a
golden
rule
to
walk
by
which
is
do
nothing
for
if
i
take
the
castle
of
roxburgh
i
take
it
for
myself
and
them
douglas
who
knew
nothing
of
the
prophecy
and
injunctions
from
the
book
of
the
destinies
of
men
became
more
convinced
than
ever
that
the
warden
knew
of
some
flaw
or
some
tangible
point
in
the
garrison
and
if
there
existed
a
knowledge
of
such
a
thing
he
resolved
to
avail
himself
of
it
by
any
means
he
knew
sir
ringan
too
well
to
suppose
he
would
confide
his
secret
to
him
without
a
certainty
of
reaping
due
advantage
and
that
therefore
it
behoved
to
give
him
a
prevailing
interest
in
it
with
this
view
he
answered
him
jocularly
though
you
were
to
receive
all
that
was
promised
to
me
in
the
event
of
my
success
you
would
probably
find
yourself
only
a
loser
by
the
guerdon
why
are
you
not
to
be
made
the
king
replied
sir
ringan
and
thereby
the
first
subject
or
rather
the
first
man
of
the
realm
for
by
the
indolence
and
retired
habits
of
our
sovereign
you
would
have
the
whole
kingdom
at
your
beck
call
you
this
nothing
my
lord
or
would
it
be
fair
and
reasonable
supposing
the
thing
possible
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
it
is
that
if
my
warriors
and
i
should
put
you
in
possessession
of
all
this
power
riches
and
honours
would
it
be
fair
i
say
that
we
should
be
again
turned
out
to
these
border
wastes
to
live
by
our
shifts
without
reaping
any
thing
of
the
benefit
should
you
take
the
castle
for
me
in
my
absence
noble
sir
ringan
your
reward
shall
be
of
your
own
naming
would
it
not
be
better
lord
douglas
that
the
reward
were
settled
and
then
i
lose
or
gain
at
my
own
risk
and
peril
if
i
deliver
you
no
produce
i
ask
no
pay
and
what
is
the
reward
sir
ringan
would
ask
for
such
a
piece
of
incalculable
service
my
choice
of
seven
baronies
on
the
west
border
to
divide
amongst
these
gentlemen
commoners
to
whose
support
i
owe
every
thing
you
are
a
master
worth
serving
brave
sir
ringan
but
such
a
grant
would
break
my
power
on
the
border
for
ever
it
is
that
your
power
on
the
border
be
broken
for
ever
lord
douglas
that
i
make
the
proffer
i
am
safer
without
the
venture
but
you
are
a
day
march
nearer
to
the
english
army
draw
off
your
men
silently
before
the
break
of
day
and
march
against
it
i
shall
supply
your
place
at
the
blockade
to
the
west
of
the
castle
without
loss
of
time
and
answer
to
you
at
your
return
for
all
ingress
or
egress
that
takes
place
in
that
division
if
sir
thomas
proves
hard
for
you
you
have
only
to
keep
your
men
together
and
fall
back
toward
the
entrenchments
you
shall
find
you
have
some
good
there
douglas
had
determined
on
no
account
to
let
this
proffer
of
the
warden
ingenious
head
and
powerful
arm
in
the
taking
of
the
fortress
pass
without
trial
so
without
more
ado
he
called
for
the
tablets
and
made
out
a
grant
to
sir
ringan
in
free
present
of
the
barony
and
lands
of
gilterscleuch
and
his
choice
of
seven
of
the
best
baronies
belonging
to
the
house
of
douglas
in
the
districts
adjoining
to
the
west
border
in
the
event
of
his
putting
james
lord
of
douglas
and
mar
in
full
possession
of
the
castle
of
roxburgh
this
grant
signed
and
sealed
the
douglas
departed
after
pledging
the
warden
and
his
friends
in
a
hearty
stirrup
cup
both
chiefs
being
alike
well
pleased
with
the
agreement
they
had
entered
into
the
douglas
posted
back
to
roxburgh
and
reached
it
just
in
time
to
put
the
western
division
of
his
army
in
motion
at
break
of
day
while
sir
ringan
made
his
musters
by
the
light
of
the
moon

marched

up

towards

across
the
border
to
the
siege
of
roxburgh
a
band
of
twelve
men
and
thirty
horses
came
up
out
of
eskdale
towards
the
most
motely
group
that
had
ever
been
seen
traversing
that
wild
country
the
men
were
dressed
as
english
peasants
of
the
lowest
order
with
broad
unshapely
hats
made
of
a
rude
felt
of
wool
and
hair
mixed
wide
coarse
that
came
below
their
knees
and
instead
of
loops
or
buttons
these
were
bound
round
the
middle
with
a
broad
the
rest
of
their
dress
was
all
conformable
save
that
each
of
them
had
a
noble
girded
by
his
side
some
of
their
horses
were
loaden
some
of
them
and
a
few
had
scarcely
any
thing
on
their
backs
at
all
but
no
man
will
guess
what
that
loading
consisted
of
not
to
keep
the
reader
in
suspense
it
was
of
that
is
of
and
all
sorts
of
hides
that
ever
came
from
the
backs
of
cattle
there
were
raw
hides
and
dried
hides
black
hides
and
white
hides
hides
with
horns
and
hides
without
horns
and
of
these
consisted
their
loading
and
nothing
else
the
men
alighted
at
to
bait
their
horses

the
following
conversation
ensued

saw
you
set
your
life
at
a
horn
let
be
the
hide
o
ane
for
whilk
we
wad
gie
a
good
deal
the
day
i
hae
seen
ye
ride
from
your
ain
party
when
that
wing
wasna
hotly
enough
engaged
and
blatter
into
the
very
thickest
and
hettest
part
o
the
field
just
girning
and
laying
on
like
some
deil
come
out
o
the
pit
but
let
me
tell
ye
will
o
craik
it
is
a
sair
fault
o
your
and
it
is
a
clagg
o
the
hale
clan
the
deil
be
your
landlord
as
he
has
already
been
mine
quietly
gin
the
hale
tott
o
ye
be
nae
ill
for
saying
ae
thing
an
thinking
another
if
ane
hear
a
laidlaw
complaining
of
pinching
and
poverty
ye
may
amaist
be
sure
that
he
has
the
best
stockit
mailings
and
the
best
filled
in
the
country
if
ye
hear
him
complaining
that
the
english
are
herrying
the
scots
up
stoop
and
roop
ye
may
rely
on
it
the
scots
hae
been
getting
the
upper
hand
and
enriching
themsels
and
and
if
ye
hear
a
laidlaw
pretending
to
be
averse
to
a
foray
or
a
battle
ye
may
depend
on
it
that
his
very
knuckles
are
itching
and
his
teeth
watering
to
be
at
na
ye
needna
waul
wi
your
muckle
een
will
for
ye
canna
deny
the
thing
and
it
is
a
d
n
provoking
gate
ye
hae
hout
dear
dan
we
just
hae
it
by
kind
to
try
what
fock
thinks
on
the
subject
a
wee
to
sound
them
like
afore
we
tell
our
hale
minds
but
a
comes
aye
freely
out
ere
the
but
the
truth
is
about
this
that
we
were
cracking
ye
ken
i
dinna
mind
a
bodle
what
the
warden
be
gaun
to
do
wi
the
skins
provided
he
keep
his
promise
and
gie
me
a
living
english
cow
for
the
hides
of
every
three
dead
anes
that
i
bring
him
there
it
goes
now
there
you
go
again
weel
i
ken
ye
carena
ae
doit
about
the
kye
ye
hae
plenty
o
baith
kye
and
ewes
already
and
on
the
contrary
ye
wad
them
to
ken
what
our
chief
is
gaun
to
be
about
wi
thir
hides
but
it
is
needless
to
fight
ye
canna
help
that
cross
gate
o
expressing
yoursel
gin
ever
ye
be
drowned
we
may
seek
you
up
the
water
there
ae
thing
will
ye
may
see
the
warden
means
some
general
good
to
us
a
by
this
project
whatever
it
is
for
he
has
sent
ae
man
o
every
name
to
gather
up
the
skins
o
his
native
district
ae
oliver
ae
armstrong
ae
laidlaw
ae
chisholm
and
twa
o
the
redhoughs
for
ye
ken
he
is
always
maist
behadden
to
his
ain
name
but
what
can
be
the
meaning
o
this
ugly
disguise
i
canna
form
a
single
conjecture
and
he
is
sae
strick
about
it
too
that
if
ane
o
us
let
oursels
be
found
out
we
lose
a
chance
of
reward
or
advantage
sae
will
ye
unco
weel
kend
about
craik
and
howpasley
and
a
the
links
o
borthwick
and
so
am
i
about
and
chisholm
and
thereabouts
gang
ye
into
my
house
a
night
and
i
gang
to
craik
gather
ye
up
the
hides
teviot
and
i
shall
take
borthwick
in
my
road
my
father
will
maybe
be
a
wee
sweer
to
take
ye
in
but
ye
maun
make
your
way
on
him
the
best
gate
ye
can
he
has
the
best
stockit
pantry
on
teviot
head
but
a
bit
of
a
laidlaw
fault
complaining
aye
maist
when
he
has
least
reason
he
has
a
capital
stock
o
hides
but
seeing
that
english
disguise
he
may
deny
them
therefore
try
him
first
and
if
he
winna
produce
them
gang
up
the
burn
about
half
a
mile
and
in
a
lown
crook
weel
hidden
frae
a
the
world
ye
find
a
bit
housie
wi
a
dozen
o
good
hides
in
it
if
he
winna
you
them
at
a
fair
price
ye
maun
take
them
for
naething
as
it
is
a
for
his
ain
advantage
na
na
dan
weel
i
wat
i
do
nae
sic
thing
i
wadna
dispute
the
auld

nor

for

there
again
aye
the

now
the

ye
for
ye
never
met
wi
him
a
your

but
ye

angered

and

wi

and
good
luck
to
the
skin
trade
it
was
one
of
those
sort
of
winter
days
that
often
occur
in
january
when
the
weather
is
what
the
shepherds
call
in
the
deadthraw
that
is
in
a
struggle
between
frost
and
thaw
there
was
a
dark
cloud
of
rime
resting
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
which
shrouded
them
in
a
veil
impervious
to
vision
beyond
the
space
of
a
few
yards
and
within
that
cloud
the
whole
height
appeared
to
be
covered
with
millions
of
razors
every
pile
of
bent
and
heath
being
loaded
with
ice
on
the
one
side
so
that
each
had
the
exact
resemblance
to
a
razor
blade
all
of
which
appeared
to
be
cast
in
the
same
mould
and
of
the
same
beautiful
metal
the
feet
of
the
horses
as
they
travelled
through
this
made
a
jingling
noise
as
if
they
had
been
wading
among
crystal
as
they
came
lower
down
on
the
hills
the
air
became
softer
and
the
ground
was
free
of
those
but
an
uncommon
gloom
hung
over
holm
and
dale
old
peter
chisholm
was
walking
on
the
green
to
the
westward
of
his
house
looking
at
his
ewes
coming
bleating
down
from
among
the
dark
foldings
of
the
rime
and
saying
to
himself
i
wonder
what
can
be
word
o
thae
dirty
herd
callants
the
day
that
they
are
letting
the
sheep
come
a
stringing
in
lang
raws
and
rairing
and
bleating
into
the
how
o
the
water
that
gate
the
country
in
a
loose
state
for
the
strength

the
day
my
stock
wad
be
a
gane
peter
was
proud
of
his
ewes
for
all
that
and
giving
them
a
whistle
he
threw
the
plaid
over
his
shoulder
set
his
broad
bonnet
up
before
and
turned
about
to
go
home
to
look
after
the
shepherd
lads
as
he
turned
his
face
to
the
north
he
naturally
cast
his
eye
up
toward
the
limycleuch
hills
where
it
instantly
embraced
the
appalling
sight
of
will
laidlaw
o
craik
and
his
disguised
compeers
with
their
fifteen
horses
coming
stretching
down
the
ridge
right
opposite
to
pate
chisholm
hirsel
of
bonny
ewes
the
old
man
eyes
were
dazzled
in
his
head
and
a
paralytic
affection
seized
his
whole
frame

by
the
time
peter
got
thus
far
with
his
soliloquy
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
for
he
was
not
only
walking
fast
but
he
was
absolutely
running
towards
home
with
a
sore
stoop
and
knees
bent
much
forward
still
as
he
hobbled
he
continued
to
apostrophise
in
short
sentences
as
he
could
gather
a
little
breath
now
and
then
to
utter
a
small
portion
of
the
concatenation
of
repulsive
ideas
that
presented
themselves

their
horses
with
the
other
two
who
went
and
put
them
up
in
a
good
large
stable
with
plenty
of
stalls
peter
ran
back
to
the
house
in
perfect
agony
speaking
to
himself
all
the
way
they
are
very
misleared
chaps
thae
they
maun
surely
either
be
low
dutch
or
else
sutors
o

sae
mad
about

i
little
wat
how
i
am
to
get
rid
o
them
the
two
lasses
appeared
armed
like
two
young
men
and
though
bess
was
will
laidlaw
own
sweetheart
he
did
not
recognize
her
through
the
disguise
neither
did
she
once
suspect
him
the
two
made
a
little
swaggering
about
the
as
they
called
them
entering
the
pantry
but
not
choosing
to
measure
arms
with
them
the
weak
suffered
the
strong
to
pass
and
will
having
his
cue
soon
discovered
the
huge
barrels
of
beef
below
the
ground
with
empty
ones
above
them
old
peter
shed
tears
of
vexation
when
he
saw
this
huge
and
store
was
all
discovered
but
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
himself
save
now
and
then
a
fairly
come
by
and
hardly
won
and
there
is
nae

nor

civil

wench
it
is

to

half
a

said
peter
an
we
dinna

gar
raise
a
the
auld
men
and
the
young
lads

two
neist
towns
for
there
is
nae
ither
left
pith
good
in
a
play
the
maid
did
as
she
was
ordered
and
peter
seeing
that
no
better
would
be
tried
to
compel
himself
to
a
sort
of
civility
which
however
sat
on
him
with
a
very
bad
grace
but
hides
hides
nothing
but
hides
was
the
burden
of
their
enquiries
while
peter
durst
not
for
his
life
produce
the
hides
deeming
that
every
man
would
know
the
hides
of
his
own
kine
and
wreak
tenfold
vengeance
on
himself
and
household
he
knew
not
he
said
what
his
son
dan
who
took
care
of
all
these
matters
had
made
of
them
sold
them
he
supposed
to
the
curriers
and
sutors
of
selkirk
and
more
than
this
pate
would
not
acknowledge
there
was
no
other
thing
for
it
nor
perhaps
did
laidlaw
want
any
thing
else
than
for
him
and
his
companions
to
walk
up
the
burn
and
make
a
seizure
of
the
whole
of
peter
excellent
hides
with
which
they
returned
loaden
to
his
dwelling
his
confusion
and
distress
of
mind
were
most
appalling
when
laidlaw
spread
them
all
out
before
him
and
asked
in
a
very
particular
manner
to
be
informed
where
he
had
got
them
o
peter
knew
nothing
about
them
they
were
not
his
at
all
he
did
not
know
to
whom
they
belonged
but
he
would
not
stand
to
speak
turning
his
back
always
on
the
men
and
hasting
away
coughing
and
speaking
to
himself
he
could
have
seen
these
presumptuous
roasted
on
a
brander
for
they
had
now
put
him
out
of
all
patience
and
all
hope

his

and
struck
laidlaw
across
the
shoulders
and
over
the
steel
bonnet
repeatedly
who
was
like
to
burst
with
repressed
laughter
but
still
persisted

unfeiroch

the

will
would
take
none
of
those
hints
he
followed
his
uncourteous
host
about
and
about
till
at
last
he
fairly
holded
him
beyond
the
fire
and
then
he
took
his
seat
over
against
him
and
conversed
on
while
his
companions
dropped
in
one
by
one
and
joined
in
it
for
a
while
they
got
it
all
to
themselves
but
at
length
pate
not
being
able
to
make
better
of
it
suffered
himself
to
be
drawn
in
by
degrees
to
join
them
still
preserving
the
same
strain
of
disingeniousness
they
asked
who
the
two
handsome
striplings
were
that
attended
him
and
spread
the
board
with
provisions
he
answered
that
they
were
two
sons
of
his
own
sons
of
thine
said
laidlaw
whoy
what
are
their
neames
simon
and
john
answered
he
or
rather
sim
and
jock
for
that
how
we
them
whoy
mon
that
is
the
queerest
thing
i
ever

said
laidlaw
then
thou
hast
two
swons
of
the
neame
of
jock
and
other
two
of
the
neame
of
sim
for
i
saw
two
of
that
neame
strapping
youths
in
the
warden
camp
peter
wist
not
well
what
answer
to
make
and
therefore
only
added
ay
ay
were
you
in
the
warden
camp
then
tell
me
is
their
ony
word
frae
my
son
dan
ay
man
i
can
tell
thee
sic
news
of
dan
as
thou
never
he
has
sitten
at
his
supper
hand
and
neive
wi
the
deil
at
these
words
one
of
the
young
men
behind
them
may
chisholm
to
wit
uttered
a
suppressed
scream
and
from
that
moment
will
laidlaw
smelled
a
rat
and
soon
discovered
his
own
beloved
bess
chisholm
standing
gazing
at
him
as
he
related
the
wonderful
story
of
her
brother
adventures
with
the
devil
the
warlock
and
the
three
evil
spirits
of
his
race
with
those
infernals
along
the
marble
pavement
of
the
air
his
transformation
into
a
horned
beast
and
of
his
eating
and
drinking
with
the
prince
of
darkness
but
the
two
striplings
were
most
of
all
shocked
at
hearing
of
the
devil
burning
stomach
and
how
the
wine
as
it
went
down
after
listening
and
wondering
while
all
these
things
were
in
relation
bess
said
to
the
next
to
her
who
chanced
to
be
sandy
pot
pray
sir
when
you
were
in
the
camp
of
sir
ringan
redhough
did
you
note
a
brave
trooper
a
friend
of
ours
named
laidlaw
oh
yes
that
i
did
said
sandy
i
know
him
well
this
was
a
glorious
joke
for
pot
and
his
comrades
were
afraid
he
would
persevere
in
it
till
he
put
their
secret
out
altogether
how
is
he
reported
in
the
army
said
she
is
it
still
alleged
that
he
is
the
bravest
and
most
successful
battler
in
the
baron
array
i
suppose
you
mean
said
sandy
for
as
to
his
battling
god
mend
that
he
is
not
noted
for
ought
that
i
ever
heard
of
except
for
keeping
a
flunkey
or
a
as
the
frenchmen
it
and
it
is
reported
thro
all
the
army
that
that
o
his
is
an
english
girl
i
can
tell
you
that
your
neighbour
will
laidlaw
is
notorious
for
nothing
else
beside
this
it
is
false
as
thyself
and
thy
perjured
ungenerous
nation
said
the
disguised
maiden
i
know
my
friend
to
be
honour
self
and
of
a
house
whose
courage
and
integrity
were
never
called
in
question
the
man
that
dares
to
slander
him
had
better
do
it
somewhere
else
than
in
my
presence
and
under
my
father
roof
but
i
degraded
him
myself
by
putting
his
name
into
the
mouth
of
such
a
mean
forager
as
thou
art
the
man
whose
actions
are
base
always
accuses
the
brave
and
generous
of
deeds
such
as
his
own
bless
me
what
ails
the
chiel
said
sandy
laughing
good
humouredly
what
the
great
ill
o
keeping
i
aince
keepit
ane
mysel
there
nae
doubt
till
my
uncle
gideon
scott
set
up
his
birse
and
gart
me
part
wi
the
creature
the
rest
laughed
at
sandy
being
put
out
of
countenance
by
the
indignant
stripling
but
bessy
chisholm
turned
on
her
heel
and
walked
out
at
the
door
muttering
expressions
about
vulgarity
raw
hides
and
maggots
and
will
laidlaw
not
able
to
contain
himself
rose
and
walked
out
after
her
in
a
visible
state
of
mental
agitation
as
he
approached
the
stable
door
quietly
into
which
she
had
turned
he
heard
her
saying
to
herself
laidlaw
keep
an
english
mistress
in
disguise
no
the
fellow
is
a
poltroon
and
a
liar
and
i
will
not
believe
it
will
entering
at
that
moment
seized
her
hand
between
both
his
and
kissed
it
saying
in
a
passionate
style
my
own
dear
and
bess
chisholm
still
never
was
there
seen
such
a
statue
of
amazement
the
tones
of
the
voice
now
uttered
in
its
natural
key
were
familiar
to
her
but
the
figure
that
uttered
them
to
be
addressed
in
that
style
by
a
great
burly
thief
of
an
english
outwent
all
comprehension
she
was
in
a
man
dress
be
it
remembered
and
there
she
stood
with
her
face
half
raised
her
ruddy
lips
wide
apart
and
her
set
eyes
of
lucent
blue
showing
a
mixture
of
astonishment
and
disdain
what
what
sir
was
all
that
she
could
say
until
the
ragamuffin
figure
reminded
her
of
the
weaponshaw
at
mountcomyn
and
some
and
vows
of
which
none
knew
save
one
but
with
a
woman
natural
caprice
she
now
was
angry
at
him
in
turn
having
discovered
her
true
sentiments
and
refused
to
acknowledge
him
as
her
lover
in
that
hateful
disguise
unless
the
meaning
of
it
was
explained
to
her
he
told
her
that
the
meaning
of
it
was
unknown
to
himself
that
he
took
it
at
his
captain
command
but
that
his
fortune
depended
on
the
secret
being
kept
there
you
are
safe
at
all
events
said
she
and
it
is
well
you
have
disclosed
yourself
in
time
for
my
father
has
raised
the
country
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
before
you
should
have
been
all
dead
men
i
think
we
have
been
in
greater
jeopardies
said
he
but
in
the
mean
time
keep
up
your
disguise
that
my
comrades
may
not
discover
your
sex
and
we
two
must
have
some
private
discourse
during
the
night
for
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
not
i
master
i
winna
court
ae
word
wi
a
man
in
the
dress
of
a
vulgar
english
boor
for
it
is
sae
hatefu
to
me
i
can
like
nought
that
within
it
ah
me
i
wot
ill
how
it
is
but
i
think
i
hardly
detest
it
sae
sair
already
my
bonny
haughty
pawkie
sweet
elizabeth
cried
but
isaac
the
curate
says
that
being
himself
a
married
man
he
could
not
go
on
with
all
the
overcharged
outrageous
stuff
that
passed
between
these
two
fond
lovers
so
he
passes
it
over
as
well
as
the
conversation
at
their
evening
meal
which
bess
took
care
to
make
a
plentiful
and
savoury
one
and
in
the
mean
time
she
was
in
such
high
spirits
herself
that
the
troopers
who
did
not
know
her
took
the
young
man
for
the
most
swaggering
puppy
they
had
ever
seen
she
challenged
sandy
pot
to
fight
her
with
single
rapier
knowing
well
that
laidlaw
would
find
some
means
of
preventing
it
but
it
was
evident
that
old
peter
thought
her
entirely
out
of
her
senses
for
he
tried
to
get
her
away
from
about
the
house
to
the
residence
of
one
of
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
yeomen
for
the
night
but
the
experiment
was
vain
when
he
saw
such
a
goodly
supper
or
dinner
for
they
were
both
in
one
set
down
to
these
uncouth
and
to
him
unwelcome
guests
he
could
not
contain
his
chagrin
and
at
first
refused
to
turn
out
to
the
board
or
partake
with
the
rest
but
when
he
saw
that
the
good
fare
would
all
go
he
grew
as
restless
as
if
he
had
been
sitting
on
pins
till
bess
who
knew
his
way
took
him
by
the
arm
and
pretended
to
force
him
jocularly
out
to
the
table
but
peter
was
not
ill
to
force
for
in
place
of
receding
he
made
all
the
haste
into
the
head
of
the
board
that
he
could
though
at
the
same
time
always
repeating
i
tell
ye
callant
it
is
downright
wastery
he
however
plied
as
good
a
knife
and
as
good
a
as
any
of
them
all
while
they
were
yet
busily
engaged
at
their
meal
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
approaching
the
door
in
a
cautious
and
uncertain
manner
and
by
a
circuitous
way
the
two
disguised
maids
whom
we
should
distinguish
by
the
names
of
sim
and
jock
as
they
sustained
these
that
night
were
standing
eating
at
the
behind
the
backs
of
the
troopers
and
when
the
trampling
was
first
heard
jock
grew
as
pale
as
death
but
sim
who
knew
what
guests
were
within
which
the
other
did
not
know
shewed
a
courage
so
undaunted
that
it
appeared
wonderful
to
all
present
save
one
but
to
jock
in
particular
o
ho
the
nearer
night
the
mae
beggars
cried
sim
who
have
we
next
that
beats

i
ever
heard
in
my
life
exclaimed
pate
i
think
the
fock
be
gane
distractedly
mad
what
brings
them
a
here
is
there
no
another
ha
house
and
pantry
in
the
hale
country
but
mine
it
is
hard
to
be
eaten
out

and
hald
wi
sorners
and
stravaegers

may
liberton

set
by
that
meat
out

a

bit
an
ye
like
goodman
said
bauldy
armstrong
it
is
best
aye
to
do
ae
thing
afore
another
by
this
time
the
dialogue
had
commenced
in
the
court
simmy
went
briskly
to
the
door
by
himself
and
demanded
of
the
strangers
who
they
were
and
what
they
wanted
they
answered
with
hesitation
that
they
supposed
they
had
lost
their
way
and
requested
to
know
who
held
the
house
and
how
it
was
called
the
house
is
held
by
my
father
a
leel
scottish
yeoman
said
the
youth
and
already
full
of
strangers
to
the
door
as
well
as
every
stall
of
his
stable
with
their
horses
pass
on
your
way
and
peace
be
with
you
did
not
i
tell
you
we
had
our
way
said
the
first
speaker
riding
up
to
the
door
pray
who
are
the
strangers
within
we
have
lost
a
party
of
our
friends
the
men
are
from
the
south
master
they
may
be
called
men
of
horns
hides
and
hair
sir
you
i
suppose
are
of
the
same
profession
precisely
of
the
same
said
the
stranger
alighting
from
his
horse
and
entering
the
house
he
was
followed
by
other
two
for
there
were
but
four
in
all
and
the
fourth
was
a
a
boy
whom
they
left
holding
their
horses
when
they
came
in
upon
peter
and
his
jolly
they
were
visibly
disappointed
and
viewed
the
group
with
marked
curiosity
these
were
not
the
men
they
expected
to
have
found
that
was
evident
but
perceiving
their
english
habits
they
ventured
to
address
them
they
were
answered
in
blunt
cutting
terms
for
our
troopers
knew
although
the
disguise
prevented
their
being
known
again
having
learned
the
name
of
the
house
and
its
owner
they
began
forthwith
to
inquire
if
any
thing
of
a
young
nobleman
had
been
seen
at
that
place
with
such
and
such
attendants
for
they
had
traced
them
to
that
very
house
they
said
and
if
the
possessors
could
give
no
account
of
them
they
would
be
held
as
responsible
old
peter
said
there
were
so
many
people
came
to
that
house
that
it
was
impossible
he
could
tell
a
tale
of
one
of
them
distinct
from
another
but
the
intrepid
sim
knowing
his
back
friends
told
him
the
whole
story
in
a
few
words
and
then
asked
them
in
turn
what
they
had
to
say
concerning
it
whoy
i
has
joost
to
say
this
young
chap
that
i
am
to
boond
thee
and
all
the
faymilie
and
carry
you
all
to
answer
before
a
meeting
of
the
wardens
ay
and
it
is
prwoper
reyght
and
prwoper
reason
too
that
they
should
friend
said
laidlaw
pretending
to
take
his
part
to
see
what
he
would
say
will
knew
the
three
men
to
be
three
notorious
english
thieves
of
the
set
of
the
halls
and
reids
and
that
they
could
not
in
fact
be
sent
in
search
of
the
lady
jane
howard
but
he
could
not
divine
their
motive
for
coming
there
or
making
the
inquiry
therefore
he
took
the
northumberland
tongue
as
well
as
he
could
and
encouraged
them
in
conversation
till
a
late
hour
yet
he
could
learn
nothing
only
he
was
sure
they
were
come
about
no
good
end
as
for
old
peter
when
he
saw
two
parties
of
englishmen
come
upon
him
and
heard
that
they
laid
their
heads
together
he
gave
himself
and
all
that
he
had
up
for
lost
and
hoping
to
conciliate
their
favour
in
some
measure
he
actually
intreated
these
last
comers
to
sit
down
and
share
of
the
remnants
of
their
supper
which
they
did
in
a
right
liberal
manner
while
peter
went
out
and
in
to
learn
the
news
he
found
by
this
time
nine
men
well
armed
assembled
in
the
barn
that
had
gathered
from
the
neighbouring
houses
whose
inhabitants
were
all
bound
to
rise
and
assist
one
another
on
any
emergency
these
were
mostly
old
men
or
very
young
ones
the
flower
of
the
border
districts
being
all
in
the
warden
camp
will
likewise
informed
his
sweetheart
privately
of
his
suspicions
and
perceiving
that
the
strangers
were
extremely
well
mounted
and
heavily
armed
he
desired
her
if
possible
to
find
means
of
concealing
their
horses
this
the
supposed
sim
soon
effected
the
boy
still
held
them
at
forage
by
the
side
of
the
old
and
he
being
brought
in
and
set
down
to
supper
some
of
those
in
the
barn
were
warned
to
take
the
horses
quietly
to
the
concealed
house
up
in
the
hollow
burn
they
were
soon
secured
there
and
the
thieves
perceiving
that
no
one
left
the
house
never
had
the
smallest
suspicion
of
any
trick
the
boy
being
fast
asleep
behind
the
board
at
length
all
of
them
grew
drowsy
andbegan
to
compose
themselves
to
rest
as
they
best
could
save
two
fond
lovers
that
were
whispering
their
vows
and
their
secrets
to
each
other
in
the
little
chamber
mentioned
in
a
former
part
of
this
history
about
midnight
when
all
was
quiet
these
two
heard
the
cry
of
from
a
neighbouring
mountain
which
in
a
short
time
was
returned
from
two
different
places
in
the
valley
now
i
will
lay
my
neck
in
wad
whispered
will
to
his
sweetheart
that
there
is
a
and
that
these
three
have
either
come
here
to
watch
you
or
to
cut
your
throats
in
case
of
resistance
or
perhaps
they
may
have
indeed
lost
their
party
in
the
mist
but
this
i
ken
neither
a
reid
nor
a
hall
ever
came
thus
far
into
scotland
for
good
if
the
fray
rise
take
you
the
command
and
fear
nothing
my
friends
and
i
will
defend
you
and
clear
your
way
but
what
shall
we
do
dear
laidlaw
with
these
three
and
the
boy
we
must
either
slay
or
bind
them
the
first
thing
we
do
or
perhaps
leave
them
to
waddle
to
the
hills
in
their
armour
on
foot
the
best
way
they
can
the
maiden
heart
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
what
lay
before
her
as
for
old
pate
he
kept
going
out
and
in
like
a
restless
spirit
and
if
he
had
not
lost
his
daughter
and
knew
not
where
she
was
he
proposed
to
have
fastened
doors
and
windows
and
burnt
all
the
nine
englishmen
where
they
lay
for
he
had
no
faith
in
any
of
them
and
weened
them
all
come
for
the
purpose
of
ruining
him
as
he
was
going
about
preparing
matters
for
this
laudable
purpose
one
of
the
shepherd
lads
came
with
the
fray
and
related
a
dismal
tale
he
said
that
he
and
his
companions
had
driven
out
all
the
sheep
and
cattle
to
the
heights
among
the
mist
as
they
had
been
commanded
that
in
the
course
of
the
evening
they
heard
many
calls
and
whistles
around
them
and
just
as
the
moon
rose
a
band
of
english
thieves
came
round
them
and
drove
them
all
off
towards
peter
assembled
friends
advised
him
to
take
the
fifteen
horses
and
what
remained
at
home
of
his
own
and
ride
off
and
try
to
recover
the
prey
without
alarming
his
dangerous
guests
but
peter
was
bent
on
fastening
the
doors
and
burning
them
skin
and
bone
for
he
said
they
would
never
get
so
easily
quit
of
them
the
two
anxious
lovers
hearing
a
bustle
without
opened
the
casement
and
overheard
a
part
of
these
perplexed
words
and
reasonings
then
hastening
out
to
join
counsel
they
raised
the
fray
openly
the
heroic
sim
flew
to
horse
and
desired
all
that
were
friends
to
the
scots
to
follow
while
laidlaw
addressed
his
compeers
saying
up
lads
and
let
us
ride
our
host
must
not
be
herried
while
we
are
under
his
roof
no
no
exclaimed
the
thieves
all
in
a
breath
he
must
not
be
herried
and
we
under
his
roof
and
no
one
appeared
in
half
such
hurry
as
they
were
to
mount
and
be
gone
stop
short
my
good
fellows
till
i
speak
with
you
for
a
minute
said
laidlaw
make
me
sure
which
side
you
will
take
before
you
go
else
one
foot
you
stir
not
from
that
i
know
you
for
anthony
reid
of
whickhope
and
those
for
two
of
your
cousins
of
tersithead
and
shrewdly
suspect
you
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
foray
anthony
drew
his
sword
so
did
laidlaw
but
the
english
troopers
were
bold
and
desperate
fellows
and
before
laidlaw
friends
could
gather
round
him
to
his
assistance
the
three
having
covered
themselves
with
their
bucklers
forced
their
way
out
back
to
back
and
ran
sandy
pot
through
the
left
shoulder
who
pressed
on
them
too
rashly
when
they
missed
their
horses
and
saw
that
they
were
clean
gone
they
foamed
like
as
many
furies
and
setting
their
backs
to
the
wall
swore
they
would
fight
it
out
the
combat
might
have
been
attended
with
much
bloodshed
had
not
all
the
people
rushed
from
the
barn
and
overpowered
them
they
were
then
taken
into
the
house
and
bound
while
pot
and
may
chisholm
alias
jock
were
left
as
guards
on
them
with
orders
to
kill
the
first
that
should
offer
to
loose
either
himself
or
any
of
his
companions
this
whole
scene
was
quite
beyond
peter
chisholm
capacity
he
could
in
nowise
conceive
how
the
one
party
of
englishmen
assisted
with
such
energy
in
detecting
and
binding
the
others
still
he
was
any
thing
but
satisfied
the
matter
having
outgone
his
comprehension
as
well
as
that
of
all
his
associates
save
one
they
now
mounted
without
delay
and
rode
with
all
manner
of
speed
toward
the
pass
of
the
hermitage
by
which
path
they
supposed
the
droves
must
necessarily
proceed
and
just
as
they
went
down
the
redcleuch
leading
their
horses
they
saw
the
cattle
passing
at
the
foot
of
it
the
party
amounted
scarcely
to
their
own
number
but
the
were
not
come
in
view
so
they
mounted
their
horses
and
instantly
mixed
with
the
men
behind
the
drove
without
offering
to
stop
the
cattle
at
the
same
time
they
placed
a
guard
of
two
farther
behind
to
prevent
all
intelligence
from
passing
between
the
two
parties
when
this
was
effected
simmy
challenged
the
cattle
as
his
father
and
desired
the
drivers
to
give
them
up
but
to
this
the
captain
of
the
gang
whose
name
was
gabriel
reid
the
younger
brother
of
anthony
and
captain
in
his
absence
only
mocked
imitating
the
sharp
treble
notes
of
the
petulant
younker
and
telling
him
that
he
would
not
give
them
up
for
three
score
such
men
as
was
else
he
was
better
than
he
looked
as
he
said
this
however
he
kept
a
curious
eye
on
the
rough
exterior
of
the
tall
athletic
english
peasants
by
whom
the
youth
was
surrounded
which
laidlaw
perceiving
accosted
him
in
his
feigned
tone
whoy
friend
we
are
countrymen
of
thee
own
and
know
thee
full
weel
thou
gabriel
reid
of

but

reid
oo

as
weel
as
all
my
friends
there
we

our
free
passages

countries
but

then

devil

thou
traitor
knave
and
for
thee
reward
this
to
thy
harnpan
said
gabriel
drawing
out
his
sword
and
attacking
laidlaw
without
more
ado
will
who
was
never
backward
at
a
brulzie
received
the
encounter
without
flinching
and
calling
for
fair
play
and
both
proceeded
to
decide
the
day
by
single
combat
while
the
rest
drew
aloof
and
looked
on
encouraging
them
only
with
cheers
and
applausive
words
laidlaw
was
mounted
on
anthony
reid
gallant
steed
which
gabriel
remarked
and
that
added
to
his
rancour
against
the
at
least
ten
degrees
the
ground
was
exceedingly
bad
so
that
they
could
not
wheel
for
without
a
parley
but
neither
would
ask
it
they
fought
close
together
first
with
their
and
afterwards
as
their
horses
came
in
contact
they
dashed
each
other
with
their
hilts
both
were
slightly
wounded
but
laidlaw
rather
had
the
worst
of
it
beshrew
thine
heart
if
thou
hast
been
a
all
thy
life
said
gabriel
as
he
turned
his
horse
in
the
path
for
another
encounter
they
had
now
changed
sides
and
this
encounter
was
longer
and
more
inveterate
than
the
first
laidlaw
not
being
quite
master
of
his
mighty
and
furious
steed
was
twice
in
imminent
danger
losing
his
broad
slouched
hat
in
the
struggle
the
crown
of
which
was
with
steel
poor
sim
had
changed
colours
ten
times
since
the
combat
began
and
on
seeing
this
last
struggle
he
lost
all
command
of
himself
and
rushed
with
his
sword
drawn
to
laidlaw
rescue
did
i
say
alas
no
one
knew
the
true
sex
save
her
lover
and
no
one
interfered
till
she
was
met
by
an
english
trooper
who
unhorsed
and
wounded
her
with
as
much
ease
of
course
as
she
had
been
a
child
will
eye
caught
the
first
glance
of
her
as
she
was
falling
and
galloping
up
to
the
rescue
as
he
was
he
clove
the
trooper
burgonet
and
slew
him
at
the
first
stroke
reid
followed
him
up
but
spirit
now
fully
proportioned
to
the
high
mettle
of
his
steed
was
a
match
for
any
thing
he
rode
against
his
antagonist
with
all
his
fury
and
having
the
advantage
of
the
brae
overthrew
horse
and
man
and
galloped
over
them
then
throwing
himself
from
his
horse
and
seizing
the
forlorn
warrior
by
the
throat
called
out
with
a
voice
of
fury
rescue
or
no
rescue
no
rescue
redsdale
to
the
fray
was
the
resolute
and
fatal
reply
will
could
not
stand
to
reason
any
more
at
that
time
so
without
more
ado
he
ran
him
through
the
body
and
flew
to
the
rescue
of
his
beloved
and
heroic
elizabeth
for
there
the
combat
began
to
thicken
she
was
on
her
feet
ere
he
arrived
and
well
guarded
and
mounting
her
palfrey
she
bade
her
lover
head
the
fray
and
pay
no
regard
to
her
for
she
was
nothing
the
worse
he
however
saw
the
blood
upon
her
bassonet
and
was
roused
to
perfect
fury
the
battle
now
became
general
but
it
was
no
regular
engagement
being
scattered
here
and
there
through
all
the
drove
some
fought
before
the
cattle
some
behind
them
and
some
in
the
middle
it
was
reported
that
at
one
time
there
were
fifteen
single
combats
all
going
on
at
the
same
instant
therefore
to
have
been
an
engagement
on
a
small
scale
it
proved
a
very
bloody
one
many
being
slain
and
wounded
on
both
sides
but
the
tremendous
bore
down
all
before
them
wherever
they
went
these
were
inured
to
battle
while
the
thieving
as
well
as
the
hinds
on
the
scottish
side
were
only
used
to
desultory
warfare
the
in
particular
was
a
dismal
sight
to
the
forayers
for
having
soon
rid
himself
of
his
first
antagonists
he
continued
galloping
about
the
field
wherever
he
saw
two
engaged
and
cut
down
all
of
the
adverse
party
as
he
went
or
rode
them
down
giving
with
every
stroke
a
hard
grin
and
a
grunt
the
men
thought
the
devil
was
come
among
them
or
else
that
he
had
fairly
taken
possession
of
a
and
giving
up
the
contest
a
few
of
them
tried
to
escape
by
flight
which
they
did
by
quitting
their
horses
and
gaining
some
inaccessible
ground
the
drivers
of
the
sheep
likewise
made
their
escape
for
they
found
the
droves
deserted
in
the
hope
the
weakest
of
the
men
having
been
left
behind
with
them
they
had
come
in
view
of
the
field
of
combat
and
marking
how
it
terminated
had
sped
them
away
out
of
danger
chisholm
party
brought
home
five
prisoners
with
them
twelve
english
horses
well
caparisoned
and
all
the
prey
save
one
ox
that
will
laidlaw
had
ridden
over
and
slain
in
the
plenitude
of
his
wrath
the
scots
had
no
fewer
than
nine
killed
and
grievously
wounded
out
of
their
small
party
of
whom
one
of
the
latter
was
the
brave
and
lovely
bess
chisholm
who
was
so
faint
that
will
was
obliged
to
carry
her
all
the
way
home
on
his
horse
before
him
clasped
to
his
bosom
he
not
failing
to
kiss
her
pallid
cheek
many
a
time
by
the
way
while
all
the
rest
wondered
at
laidlaw
great
concern
about
the
youth
when
peter
saw
his
child
borne
into
the
house
pale
and
wounded
he
lost
all
recollection
of
the
secret
of
her
sex
and
cried
out
o
my
poor
bess
my
dear
daughter
what
had
i
ado
making
a
man
of
thee
thy
blood
is
on
thy
old
father
head
alas
for
my
beloved
daughter
daughter
exclaimed
they
all
again
and
again
daughter
will
laidlaw
as
if
he
had
not
known
well
before
daughter
cried
the
have
we
then
been
led
to
the
field
by
a
maid
shame
on
our
heads
that
suffered
the
overthrow
against
the
rules
of
chivalry
as
her
attempt
was
alas
for
the
gallant
and
high
spirited
young
dame
they
put
her
to
bed
and
dressed
her
wounds
and
from
all
appearances
had
high
hopes
that
she
was
more
afraid
and
fatigued
than
hurt
she
soon
fell
into
a
quiet
slumber
in
which
they
left
her
and
retired
to
take
some
refreshment
and
talk
over
their
morning
adventure
it
turned
out
as
suggested
that
their
three
prisoners
were
the
three
chief
men
of
the
gang
who
had
completely
lost
themselves
and
all
traces
of
their
companions
among
the
mist
and
having
heard
a
report
of
the
seizure
formerly
made
at
that
place
they
cunningly
tried
to
pass
themselves
off
as
messengers
sent
in
search
of
the
lost
travellers
if
they
had
been
with
their
own
party
that
would
have
proved
an
overmatch
for
the
chisholms
the
reids
and
halls
had
been
herried
of
their
whole
live
stock
by
the
warden
people
and
learning
that
the
greater
part
of
it
was
driven
up
into
these
mountains
they
naturally
wanted
to
make
some
reprisals
and
recover
their
own
again
had
it
not
been
for
their
misfortune
in
separating
and
the
exertions
of
the
gallant
they
would
have
effected
their
purpose
with
the
utmost
ease
it
proved
a
luckless
raid
for
them
for
they
lost
all
their
horses
the
greater
part
of
their
men
and
the
chief
squire
anthony
and
six
of
his
friends
were
sent
prisoners
to
the
castle
of
mountcomyn
the
country
people
at
chisholm
board
were
loud
in
praise
of
the
and
of
their
trusty
and
gallant
behaviour
in
particular
they
averred
that
laidlaw
had
killed
the
half
of
the
thieves
with
his
own
hand
for
that
he
rode
about
the
field
like
a
resistless
angel
destroying
all
before
him
when
peter
heard
that
he
fought
so
valiantly
for
the
recovery
of
his
stock
and
regained
his
darling
daughter
life
his
heart
warmed
toward
him
and
he
bid
him
ask
any
thing
of
him
he
chose
that
was
in
his
power
to
give
and
he
should
not
be
said
nay
will
at
once
asked
the
maid
whose
life
he
had
saved
for
his
wife
peter
hesitated
and
said
it
was
hard
to
bestow
the
flower
of
all
the
chisholms
on
an
english
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
neither
house
nor
name
or
was
ashamed
to
own
them
however
as
he
had
proved
himself
a
warrior
and
a
hero
peter
consented
provided
the
maid
grew
better
and
was
herself
satisfied
with
the
match
will
said
he
asked
her
on
no
other
terms
and
went
ben
to
see
her
before
he
departed
she
was
still
sound
asleep
or
pretended
to
be
so
therefore
unwilling
to
disturb
her
he
breathed
a
blessing
over
her
and
impressed
two
or
three
warm
affectionate
kisses
on
her
lips
as
he
came
away
he
felt
a
slight
pressure
of
her
arms
around
his
neck
when
sandy
pot
learned
that
the
lovely
youth
with
whom
he
had
watched
the
prisoners
all
the
night
and
morning
of
the
battle
was
a
maid
and
the
younger
sister
of
his
gallant
friend
dan
sandy
wound
grew
so
ill
that
he
could
not
be
removed
so
he
remained
where
he
was
and
the
other
four
went
off
with
their
uncouth
loading
they
found
dan
chisholm
at
hawick
waiting
for
them
in
the
utmost
impatience
having
collected
no
fewer
than
twenty
of
hides
every
one
of
them
in
size
like
a
and
away
the
motely
train
marched
and
joined
the
warden
on
the
night
after
his
arrival
before
the
walls
of
roxburgh
chapter
viii
so
they
shot
out
and
they
shot
in
till
the
morn
that
it
was
day
when
mony
o
the
englishmen
about
the
lay
when
they
hae
yoket
carts
and
wains
to
ca
their
dead
away
and
shot
auld
dikes
aboon
the
lave
in
gutters
where
they
lay
of
old
the
expedition
of
the
douglas
against
musgrave
is
like
the
innumerable
border
battles
of
that
reign
only
shortly
mentioned
by
historians
and
although
it
was
a
notable
encounter
and
is
detailed
by
isaac
at
great
length
it
lies
out
of
our
way
here
let
it
suffice
that
they
skirmished
cautiously
for
two
days
with
various
success
and
at
last
came
to
an
engagement
on
a
field
right
opposite
to
the
junction
of
the
tweed
and
gala
after
a
hard
fought
battle
left
wing
was
discomfitted
and
just
as
he
was
arranging
his
force
so
as
to
cover
the
retreat
an
unaccountable
confusion
was
noted
among
the
english
ranks
which
seemed
to
be
engaged
anew
and
with
one
another
there
being
no
other
army
nigh
douglas
recalling
his
routed
squadrons
faced
about
but
advanced
with
caution
till
he
saw
musgrave
army
broken
and
flying
in
all
directions
this
gallant
feat
was
accomplished
by
a
sir
john
gordon
who
was
on
his
way
with
seven
hundred
fresh
men
to
the
assistance
of
douglas
and
as
he
came
on
the
english
ranks
behind
at
that
important
crisis
he
broke
them
at
the
first
onset
and
took
sir
thomas
musgrave
prisoner
with
his
own
hand
thus
far
the
affairs
of
douglas
wore
the
aspect
of
prosperity
but
a
settled
gloom
hung
over
his
mind
an
oppression
of
spirits
was
apparent
in
every
sentence
that
he
uttered
and
every
plan
he
suggested
and
these
were
far
from
being
traits
of
his
wonted
disposition
but
the
monk
benjamin
had
been
with
him
again
and
again
had
been
harrassing
his
soul
with
commissions
and
messages
from
the
mansions
of
the
dead
and
one
night
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
lost
and
dearly
regretted
princess
speaking
to
him
in
his
tent
as
it
were
out
of
the
canvas
still
the
most
solemn
injunctions
of
secrecy
were
imposed
on
him
insomuch
that
he
deemed
himself
not
at
liberty
to
open
his
mind
to
any
one
besides
all
this
the
disconsolate
mary
kirkmichael
had
been
constantly
lingering
nigh
to
him
and
always
presenting
herself
in
the
utmost
agony
of
mind
to
make
enquiries
about
her
royal
mistress
that
lady
appearance
became
so
terrible
to
him
that
he
was
unable
to
bear
it
and
gave
strict
charges
that
she
should
not
be
suffered
to
come
within
the
limits
of
his
camp
but
for
all
that
availing
herself
of
her
rank
and
her
privilege
she
forced
her
way
to
him
several
times
and
at
every
visit
filled
his
soul
with
the
most
racking
torments
so
that
harrassed
with
as
he
was
he
found
this
his
first
intercourse
with
attended
with
ten
times
more
distracting
and
grievous
perils
than
the
former
while
on
the
other
hand
the
heroes
that
visited
the
castle
of
aikwood
even
those
who
escaped
not
including
the
wretched
victims
who
remained
behind
discovered
to
their
dear
bought
experience
that
there
were
perils
in
nature
infinitely
superior
to
both
it
is
now
absolutely
necessary
to
shorten
the
curate
narrative
to
prevent
this
work
running
to
an
inordinate
length
and
though
two
of
his
tales
have
been
left
out
already
the
great
events
that
follow
must
also
be
related
in
a
style
abbreviated
though
not
mangled
by
indistinctness
after
the
intrepid
lord
musgrave
had
sacrificed
his
own
life
in
order
to
save
those
of
his
only
brother
and
the
lady
of
his
love
clavering
was
unanimously
chosen
captain
in
his
room
and
every
soldier
took
a
new
oath
to
him
to
die
in
defence
of
the
fortress
the
commission
of
which
he
accepted
was
a
dismal
one
but
he
entered
into
all
the
feelings
of
the
famishing
inmates
in
their
hatred
of
the
scots
and
implacable
enmity
against
them
therefore
he
was
the
very
man
for
their
purpose
every
attempt
of
the
besiegers
to
scale
the
walls
of
the
castle
or
to
gain
an
entrance
by
fraud
or
force
had
hitherto
proved
utterly
abortive
the
determined
sons
of
england
laughed
at
them
regarding
them
in
no
other
light
than
as
freaks
of
mere
insanity
or
the
gambols
of
children
the
fortress
was
impregnable
with
such
heroes
within
had
they
been
supplied
with
sufficient
stores
of
food
and
of
arrows
both
of
which
had
long
been
exhausted
and
though
a
small
and
welcome
supply
of
the
former
had
been
obtained
during
the
tempest
and
the
flood
which
followed
for
which
they
were
obliged
to
the
devil
and
master
michael
scott
yet
like
all
the
benefits
derived
from
that
quarter
it
proved
rather
more
hurtful
than
advantageous
for
they
devoured
it
with
such
avidity
that
the
distemper
with
which
they
had
formerly
been
visited
broke
out
among
them
with
greater
violence
than
ever
yet
disregarding
all
these
privations
which
a
would
suppose
might
naturally
tend
to
break
the
human
heart
and
daunt
the
resolution
of
the
boldest
with
famine
and
pestilence
both
staring
them
in
the
face
they
bound
themselves
by
a
new
and
fearful
oath
never
to
yield
the
fortress
to
the
scots
while
a
man
of
them
remained
alive
every
new
calamity
acted
but
as
a
new
spur
to
their
resolution
and
their
food
being
again
on
the
very
eve
of
exhaustion
their
whole
concern
was
how
to
procure
a
new
supply
not
that
they
valued
their
own
lives
or
their
own
sufferings
these
had
for
a
good
while
been
only
a
secondary
consideration
but
from
the
excruciating
dread
that
they
should
die
out
and
the
scots
attain
possession
of
the
fortress
before
christmas
the
warders
soon
noted
the
alteration
that
had
taken
place
in
the
beleaguering
army
they
perceived
the
ground
that
had
formerly
been
occupied
by
the
angus
men
and
the
mar
highlanders
now
taken
up
by
the
tall
athletic
and
careless
looking
borderers
against
whom
they
found
their
antipathy
was
not
so
mortal
and
they
had
some
surmisings
of
what
really
was
the
case
that
a
strong
diversion
had
been
made
in
their
favours
that
had
drawn
off
their
inveterate
and
hateful
enemy
douglas
from
the
siege
every
hour
convinced
them
farther
of
the
truth
of
this
suggestion
for
they
perceived
a
laxness
in
the
manner
of
conducting
the
blockade
which
they
had
not
witnessed
for
many
days
and
all
their
conversation
turned
on
the
manner
in
which
they
ought
to
avail
themselves
of
it
the
carelessness
of
the
besiegers
themselves
or
something
subordinate
thereto
soon
furnished
an
opportunity
to
them
of
putting
their
policy
once
more
to
the
test
and
that
by
an
adventure
the
most
ardently
desired
on
the
second
day
after
the
departure
of
douglas
the
warder
on
the
topmost
tower
perceived
on
a
rising
ground
two
miles
to
the
southward
about
thirty
head
of
cattle
that
came
gradually
in
view
as
a
wing
of
a
large
drove
might
be
supposed
to
do
and
after
they
had
fed
for
some
time
there
two
men
came
before
them
and
chased
them
back
out
of
sight
of
the
castle
as
if
a
great
oversight
had
been
committed
by
letting
them
come
in
view
of
it
notice
of
this
important
discovery
was
instantly
given
to
the
captain
and
the
news
spreading
among
the
garrison
many
a
long
and
longing
look
was
cast
from
the
battlements
and
loopholes
of
the
high
western
tower
that
day
they
were
not
cast
in
vain
just
toward
the
fall
of
evening
they
perceived
a
part
of
the
drove
appear
again
only
a
very
short
space
from
the
castle
and
they
likewise
perceived
by
their
colours
that
they
were
a
drove
of
english
beasts
which
had
been
brought
from
their
native
pastures
by
the
strong
hand
of
rapine
for
the
supply
of
this
new
come
border
army
they
perceived
likewise
that
they
approached
the
army
by
a
concealed
way
that
the
two
glances
they
got
of
them
were
merely
casual
and
that
they
were
very
slightly
guarded
a
council
of
war
was
immediately
called
in
which
it
was
agreed
without
one
dissentient
voice
that
the
garrison
should
make
a
sham
sally
at
the
eastern
as
if
with
intent
to
gain
the
city
in
order
that
they
might
draw
the
attention
of
the
besiegers
to
that
point
and
in
the
meantime
the
captain
with
the
choicest
of
the
men
were
to
march
out
by
of
which
the
garrison
had
necessarily
the
sole
possession
and
endeavour
to
seize
the
prey
thence
they
were
to
proceed
westward
and
try
to
elude
the
enemy
posts
or
give
them
battle
if
the
former
were
found
to
be
impracticable
but
at
all
events
either
to
die
or
succeed
in
attaining
that
valuable
supply
or
a
part
of
it
the
success
of
the
contest
now
turned
on
that
single
point
as
on
a
pivot
the
balance
was
against
them
but
that
turned
in
their
favours
by
an
exertion
of
warrior
prowess
they
could
then
reckon
on
a
complete
triumph
over
their
unappeasable
foes
besides
every
thing
seemed
to
concur
in
support
of
their
gallant
expedition
the
nights
were
dark
even
beyond
their
usual
darkness
at
that
gloomy
season
and
the
moon
did
not
arise
till
two
in
the
morning
both
these
circumstances
were
in
their
favour
the
one
in
attaining
possession
of
the
prey
unperceived
and
the
other
in
enabling
them
to
fight
their
way
home
for
they
knew
that
though
they
themselves
might
pass
the
strong
scottish
posts
favoured
by
the
deep
darkness
still
it
was
impossible
to
bring
the
drove
through
them
and
along
the
bridge
without
a
hard
skirmish
the
captain
therefore
gave
command
to
the
division
left
behind
that
the
more
noise
they
heard
of
an
engagement
about
the
bridge
of
teviot
and
the
gate
toward
the
west
the
more
they
should
press
their
battle
eastward
to
divert
the
strength
of
the
army
to
that
quarter
because
on
that
side
the
scots
could
make
no
impression
and
the
english
could
lose
nothing
there
save
a
few
lives
which
they
accounted
of
small
avail
but
if
the
expedition
to
the
west
failed
their
cause
was
finally
ruined
that
was
a
busy
evening
within
the
walls
of
roxburgh
while
all
was
quietness
and
indifference
without
within
there
was
arming
and
disarming
for
the
suits
of
armour
that
once
fitted
these
emaciated
warriors
would
not
now
hang
on
their
frames
there
was
grinding
of
swords
pointing
of
spears
and
and
even
the
of
the
fort
were
cleared
with
a
provident
concern
seldom
overlooked
by
englishmen
and
at
eleven
at
night
by
the
convent
matin
bell
clavering
with
five
hundred
chosen
men
well
armed
issued
silently
from
the
garrison
creeping
along
the
on
their
hands
and
knees
from
that
they
proceeded
westward
in
the
most
profound
silence
and
so
close
by
the
scottish
posts
that
they
heard
them
breathing
and
conversing
together
one
party
crept
up
all
the
way
within
the
and
the
other
led
by
clavering
himself
past
through
between
two
scottish
posts
drawing
themselves
along
the
ground
close
on
their
breasts
and
once
or
twice
were
obliged
to
squat
close
down
and
lie
silent
for
a
considerable
space
while
the
following
dialogue
passed
between
the
sentinels
od
sandie

ye
it
can
be
true
that

english
are

that

hist
havering
say
benedicite
at
that
instant
a
sharp
breeze
arose
which
drowned
the
noise
and
clavering
and
his
men
passed
fairly
by
on
their
perilous
expedition
beyond
the
next
hollow
they
found
the
cattle
all
lying
puffing
and
dozing
on
a
round
hill
an
immense
drove
of
them
there
seemed
to
be
for
the
hill
appeared
to
be
literally
covered
but
the
night
was
as
dark
as
pitch
and
they
could
see
nothing
distinctly
clavering
gave
his
commands
in
a
whisper
to
his
chief
men
to
surround
the
whole
drove
and
drive
them
furiously
that
by
these
means
they
might
throw
the
enemy
lines
into
confusion
we
have
the
advantage
of
the
ground
said
he
the
bridge
is
clear
and
the
gates
open
let
us
play
the
men
for
once
and
our
difficulties
are
all
over
providence
has
favoured
us
beyond
what
could
have
been
calculated
on
our
force
is
superior
to
that
of
our
enemies
on
this
side
the
river
on
whatever
side
our
column
is
attacked
let
us
keep
a
running
fight
so
as
to
push
on
and
preserve
the
prey
and
the
day
is
our
own
and
now
saint
anthony
for
the
right
the
men
then
formed
themselves
into
a
crescent
behind
the
cattle
deep
and
with
club
goad
and
spear
pushed
them
on
there
were
a
few
dour
lazy
driving
runts
behind
that
bore
all
the
thumps
but
the
bulk
were
and
galloped
off
on
the
path
toward
roxburgh
with
the
utmost
fury
insomuch
that
the
delighted
drivers
never
got
a
sight
of
them
they
broke
through
the
scottish
lines
without
either
stop
or
stay
the
alarm
was
instantly
given
but
a
night
muster
is
always
attended
with
some
delay
so
the
english
thought
so
they
said
and
to
their
great
joy
they
found
their
suggestions
realized
for
not
till
the
last
cow
was
past
the
strong
line
of
posts
on
the
height
were
they
attacked
by
the
scots
but
then
indeed
the
gemelscleuch
and
howpasley
men
set
upon
them
with
unparallelled
fury
and
being
every
five
minutes
joined
by
more
of
their
companions
they
pressed
hard
upon
the
english
who
being
obliged
to
keep
up
a
retreating
battle
fell
thick
on
the
brae
beyond
the
bridge
the
brave
and
judicious
longspeare
himself
led
the
attack
and
behaved
like
a
lion
for
though
wounded
in
three
different
places
of
the
body
he
fought
in
the
front
of
the
main
battle
all
that
night
the
scots
to
the
utter
amazement
of
their
enemies
never
once
offered
to
stop
the
cattle
but
merely
attacking
the
english
crescent
behind
drove
them
and
cattle
and
all
towards
the
bridge
this
clavering
and
his
chief
men
attributed
wholly
to
the
surprise
by
which
the
scots
were
taken
and
when
the
former
saw
the
dark
column
of
cattle
take
the
bridge
he
thanked
the
god
of
heaven
the
blessed
virgin
and
all
the
saints
whose
names
were
known
to
him
for
such
a
wonderful
success
and
merciful
deliverance
the
english
host
then
raised
such
a
shout
of
triumph
that
the
echoes
called
from
the
castled
towers
to
the
forest
and
from
the
forest
to
the
distant
rocks
the
scots
soon
joined
in
it
with
equal
enthusiasm
and
the
two
armies
then
engaged
at
the
eastern
gate
also
joined
their
voices
to
the
general
chorus
the
gray
friars
of
roxburgh
and
the
benedictine
monks
of
kelso
raised
their
heads
from
their
flinty
pillows
committed
themselves
to
heaven
and
deplored
the
madness
and
folly
of
the
men
of
the
world
the
city
dames
wept
and
prayed
and
the
men
ran
to
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
uproar
the
sounds
were
actually
heard
in
the
camp
of
douglas
at
the
distance
of
sixteen
miles
and
when
this
was
reported
to
him
next
morning
he
said
there
was
the
redhough
on
the
ramparts
of
roxburgh
but
man
thoughts
are
vanity
he
can
not
judge
of
events
so
as
to
calculate
on
what
is
to
happen
from
one
moment
to
another
incidents
of
the
slightest
moment
so
often
having
the
effect
of
overturning
the
greatest
and
most
momentous
enterprizes
never
was
there
one
so
nearly
overturned
as
this
although
it
was
not
once
thought
of
till
afterwards
and
it
was
on
this
wise
there
was
a
strong
guard
of
english
placed
at
the
south
end
of
the
bridge
to
guide
the
foremost
of
the
drove
on
to
it
or
help
to
cut
a
way
for
the
cattle
through
such
troops
as
might
interpose
the
cattle
as
was
said
came
galloping
furiously
without
intervention
and
as
if
led
by
an
unseen
providence
took
the
bridge
with
all
their
vigour
the
battle
being
then
raging
behind
them
and
the
shouts
beginning
to
rend
the
sky
this
guard
had
nothing
to
do
of
course
but
to
open
into
two
lines
and
give
them
head
but
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
there
was
a
deep
puddle
and
among
the
men
there
chanced
to
be
a
little
boy
who
was
running
about
and
thrashing
the
cattle
as
they
went
through
this
puddle
which
made
them
spring
up
the
arch
with
redoubled
velocity
which
the
urchin
thought
good
sport
but
in
the
midst
of
this
frolic
he
bolted
away
at
once
with
such
velocity
that
he
had
almost
overthrown
one
of
the
men
in
the
file
and
as
he
ran
he
cried
out
lord
saw
ever
ony
mortal
the
like
o
that
what
was
it
rash
idiot
said
the
man
grace
and
mercy
man
did
you
not
see
how
yon
great
black
stott
stood
straight
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
waded
the
pool
said
the
boy
take
that
to
clear
your
eyes
impertinent
brat
said
the
man
and
gave
him
a
blow
with
his
fist
that
made
him
run
away
howling
and
crying
always
repeating
as
he
went
i
tell
your
captain
now
will
i
that
now
the
combat
behind
the
cattle
thickened
apace
the
english
were
sore
borne
down
on
the
hill
but
when
they
came
to
the
little
plain
at
the
they
stood
firm
and
gave
as
hard
blows
as
they
got
they
had
fairly
gained
their
aim
and
their
spirits
so
long
depressed
mounted
to
an
unusual
height
the
last
lingering
hoof
of
the
whole
countless
drove
was
now
on
the
arch
and
they
could
calculate
on
holding
out
the
fortress
against
their
hated
foes
not
only
till
christmas
but
till
that
time
twelvemonth
their
shouts
of
joy
were
redoubled
so
also
were
those
of
the
scots
the
people
are
mad
said
they
thus
to
shout
for
their
own
loss
and
their
own
defeat
it
is
a
small
trait
of
the
cursed
perversity
of
the
whole
nation
the
english
narrowed
their
front
and
narrowed
their
front
still
as
their
files
found
room
on
the
arch
of
the
bridge
which
was
long
and
narrow
and
very
steep
at
the
south
end
that
rose
directly
from
the
plain
but
the
road
up
to
the
castle
by
the
two
tremendous
iron
gates
was
likewise
exceedingly
steep
and
went
by
a
winding
ascent
so
that
the
latter
end
of
the
drove
those
dull
driving
ones
that
bore
all
the
strokes
got
very
slowly
up
and
with
great
difficulty
there
was
a
guard
of
considerable
strength
left
in
this
gateway
by
clavering
lest
any
attempt
should
be
made
by
the
enemy
to
enter
in
his
absence
but
these
men
had
strict
charges
to
clear
the
way
for
the
cattle
and
help
to
drive
the
foremost
ones
up
the
steep
the
fore
part
of
the
drove
however
came
up
the
steep
with
such
main
fury
that
the
men
were
glad
to
clear
a
way
for
them
by
flying
out
of
the
path
up
to
the
citadel
there
was
not
a
man
left
in
the
gateway
save
two
at
each
of
the
iron
portcullises
and
these
stood
in
deep
niches
of
the
wall
out
of
all
danger
each
of
these
men
held
the
end
of
a
chain
that
was
twisted
round
an
immense
bolt
in
the
wall
and
these
bolts
isaac
says
are
to
be
seen
sticking
to
this
day
on
untwisting
this
chain
the
portcullises
fell
down
and
when
they
were
to
raise
up
it
was
done
with
levers
well
as
the
two
outermost
men
stood
in
their
niches
holding
by
the
ends
of
their
chains
they
observed
that
two
of
the
oxen
that
first
came
in
nay
the
very
first
two
that
came
in
turned
round
their
ugly
heads
leaned
their
sides
to
the
wall
and
kept
in
their
places
the
one
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
on
the
other
till
the
whole
drove
passed
them
the
men
could
not
move
from
their
posts
to
drive
them
on
with
the
rest
but
they
wondered
at
the
beasts
and
the
one
cried
to
the
other
what
can
ail
them
two
chaps
o
them
are
two
tired
ones
said
the
other
dom
them
for
two
ugly
monsters
they
look
as
them
hod
been
dead
and
roosen
again
at
length
by
dint
of
sore
driving
and
beating
the
last
hoof
of
the
warden
choice
drove
passed
inward
through
the
castle
gate
of
roxburgh
for
the
maintenance
of
his
irascible
enemies
could
any
thing
be
so
unfortunate
or
how
was
he
to
set
up
his
face
and
answer
to
the
douglas
now
but
the
redhough
was
determined
that
he
would
set
up
his
face
and
answer
to
the
douglas
and
his
country
too
as
well
as
to
his
kinsmen
and
followers
whom
he
valued
highest
of
all
just
as
the
last
lazy
cow
crossed
the
gate
and
when
the
triumphant
shouts
of
the
english
were
at
the
loudest
the
two
great
lubberly
oxen
that
stood
shaking
their
ugly
heads
and
leaning
against
the
wall
ripped
up
their
own
bellies
and
out
of
two
stuffed
hides
two
most
ingenious
cases
started
up
two
no
less
men
than
sir
ringan
redhough
and
his
doughty
friend
charlie
scott
of
yardbire
off
went
the
heads
of
the
two
porters
in
one
moment
and
down
came
the
portcullis
with
a
thundering
rattle
and
a
clank
that
made
the
foundations
of
the
gate
shake
now
southron
lads
haud
ye
there
cried
the
redhough
time
about
is
fair
play
keep
ye
the
outside
o
the
door
threshold
as
lang
as
ye
hae
gart
us
keep
it
they
next
went
up
and
seized
the
other
two
porters
whom
they
saved
alive
to
teach
them
how
to
bolt
bar
open
and
shut
the
gates
but
the
men
had
taken
the
oaths
with
the
rest
and
remained
obstinate
no
threatening
could
make
them
move
either
finger
or
tongue
except
in
mockery
which
provoked
the
redhough
so
that
he
despatched
them
likewise
on
reaching
the
great
square
the
warden
found
his
men
in
peaceable
possession
six
score
brave
chosen
men
had
entered
among
the
cattle
each
in
a
stuffed
ox
or
cow
hide
and
had
now
like
their
captain
cast
their
sloughs
and
stood
armed
at
all
points
to
execute
his
commands
they
found
nothing
to
do
save
a
prodigious
difficulty
in
working
their
way
from
the
western
to
the
eastern
gate
there
were
so
many
turnings
and
windings
so
many
doors
and
wickets
so
many
ascents
and
descents
that
an
army
might
have
gained
possession
of
the
one
end
and
yet
have
been
kept
out
of
the
other
for
years
but
the
surprise
here
was
so
complete
that
the
borderers
had
in
fact
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
the
possession
thus
obtained
in
so
easy
and
at
the
same
time
so
gallant
a
style
the
shouts
that
arose
from
the
western
battle
had
so
much
encouraged
those
at
the
eastern
gate
that
they
had
sallied
out
and
attacking
the
besiegers
sword
in
hand
had
driven
them
back
within
their
strong
line
of
defence
this
retreat
was
a
part
of
the
plan
of
the
scots
to
draw
off
the
remaining
force
from
the
gate
and
while
they
were
in
the
hottest
of
the
skirmish
down
came
redhough
and
his
lads
from
the
interior
of
the
castle
behind
them
cut
down
the
few
guards
about
the
entrance
and
the
with
ease
and
having
raised
that
and
shut
the
double
gates
on
that
quarter
likewise
he
placed
the
armstrongs
there
as
a
guard
and
returned
into
the
interior
still
uncertain
what
enemies
he
had
to
combat
within
this
mighty
fortress
was
from
the
one
drawbridge
to
the
other
a
full
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
walled
and
moated
round
and
contained
seven
distinct
squares
or
castles
every
one
of
which
was
a
fortress
of
itself
but
the
strongest
of
all
was
the
division
on
the
western
part
which
was
denominated
the
citadel
and
had
gates
and
bars
of
its
own
and
towers
that
rose
far
above
the
rest
into
this
strong
place
the
sole
remnant
of
the
english
soldiers
had
retreated
which
consisted
merely
of
the
guard
that
kept
the
western
porch
and
made
way
for
the
cattle
a
few
stragglers
beside
and
some
official
people
that
kept
always
within
through
every
other
part
of
the
castle
the
scots
found
free
passage
and
by
the
time
the
moon
had
been
risen
for
an
hour
the
shouts
of
a
douglas
a
douglas
a
redhough
a
redhough
were
heard
from
every
part
of
the
walls
excepting
the
western
tower
there
indeed
a
faint
and
subdued
shout
announced
at
intervals
the
name
of
the
king
of
england
for
it
was
now
no
more
a
musgrave
and
as
for
clavering
they
wist
not
whether
he
was
dead
or
alive
taken
or
at
liberty
when
the
first
ranks
of
the
englishmen
that
came
up
behind
the
cattle
saw
the
gates
shut
against
them
they
took
it
for
some
accident
or
some
mistake
that
the
porters
had
fallen
into
on
listening
to
the
shouts
of
the
adverse
parties
but
after
calling
and
remonstrating
to
no
purpose
they
began
to
suspect
that
there
was
treason
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
the
whisper
of
treason
spread
among
that
part
of
the
forces
which
was
now
forced
against
the
gate
they
could
do
nothing
for
they
neither
had
room
to
fight
nor
fly
and
they
knew
not
whom
to
suspect
or
what
had
befallen
them
as
for
those
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
they
were
so
hotly
engaged
with
their
opponents
that
they
had
little
time
to
consider
of
any
thing
but
finding
themselves
fixed
to
the
spot
and
no
movement
making
toward
the
gate
they
conceived
that
something
there
was
wrong
which
retarded
the
regular
entrance
of
the
troops
for
so
long
a
time
they
now
fought
only
three
to
three
abreast
on
the
steep
arch
of
the
bridge
down
which
the
english
drove
the
scots
six
or
seven
times
the
latter
always
returning
to
the
charge
with
that
vigour
which
a
certainty
of
success
inspires
clavering
fought
them
in
the
rear
and
in
the
hottest
of
the
battle
still
encouraging
his
men
to
deeds
of
desperate
valour
little
weening
how
matters
went
within
but
when
the
names
of
the
scottish
chiefs
were
resounded
from
the
walls
every
heart
among
the
english
was
chilled
and
every
arm
unnerved
in
one
instant
they
had
no
conception
how
the
thing
could
have
happened
it
appeared
so
far
beyond
all
human
power
to
have
effected
it
that
it
was
several
hours
before
it
gained
general
credit
among
them
they
had
kept
the
fortress
so
long
with
so
little
dread
of
its
being
wrested
from
them
and
withal
suffered
so
much
in
it
that
they
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
their
senses
that
by
a
course
of
events
entirely
of
their
own
planning
they
should
be
all
without
the
walls
and
the
scots
within
it
was
like
a
work
of
enchantment
like
some
of
the
late
inconceivable
works
of
the
spirits
of
divination
the
scots
could
make
no
impression
on
them
upon
that
long
narrow
bridge
but
they
could
not
long
stand
cooped
up
there
and
when
they
saw
that
all
hope
was
lost
of
regaining
entrance
they
threw
themselves
over
a
high
parapet
and
took
possession
of
the
steep
bank
between
the
bottom
of
the
southern
wall
and
the
river
teviot
the
river
being
dammed
below
it
stood
like
a
frith
round
the
bottom
of
this
bank
which
was
so
steep
that
they
could
not
stand
on
it
but
were
obliged
to
clamber
alongst
it
on
their
hands
and
feet
escape
being
impracticable
the
scots
suffered
them
to
take
possession
of
that
bank
undisputed
and
to
keep
it
supposing
they
must
surrender
next
day
but
a
great
number
were
slain
before
the
latter
end
of
the
train
was
disentangled
of
the
bridge
the
scots
had
now
free
access
to
the
gate
into
which
gemelscleuch
and
howpasley
were
admitted
the
warden
embraced
them
and
thanked
them
for
their
wise
counsel
as
well
as
their
great
bravery
and
they
again
set
about
traversing
and
surveying
the
fortress
concerning
which
charlie
scott
said
it
wad
tak
a
man
a
year
and
a
day
to
find
out
the
turnings
and
windings
about
it
the
battle
at
the
eastern
had
continued
from
midnight
without
intermission
and
after
the
break
of
day
our
chiefs
witnessed
a
scene
from
the
walls
that
was
without
a
parallel
that
division
of
the
scots
army
was
composed
of
douglas
men
being
the
same
troops
that
were
there
before
and
they
were
commanded
by
sir
james
douglas
of
dalkeith
that
knight
got
private
intelligence
of
the
intention
to
storm
the
castle
by
what
means
he
knew
not
but
resolved
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
and
as
he
was
desired
when
the
sortie
was
made
he
retreated
at
first
drawing
them
off
from
the
gate
when
the
cry
arose
that
the
castle
was
taken
his
men
became
frantic
with
joy
and
resolute
on
taking
ample
vengeance
on
their
enemies
they
burst
upon
them
without
regularity
making
great
havock
and
at
the
same
time
throwing
away
many
of
their
own
lives
sir
james
with
great
difficulty
restrained
them
called
a
parley
and
offered
the
expelled
garrison
quarter
but
they
returned
for
answer
that
they
weened
he
had
called
the
parley
to
ask
quarter
of
them
and
they
had
determined
to
refuse
it
they
concluded
by
telling
him
to
see
to
himself
and
insult
them
no
more
by
such
messages
for
as
yet
he
knew
not
with
whom
he
was
warring
the
battle
was
then
renewed
by
the
light
of
the
moon
with
greater
fury
than
ever
they
fought
like
baited
bears
with
recklessness
of
life
and
the
silence
of
death
deadly
hate
was
in
every
thrust
and
the
last
words
of
every
falling
warrior
were
have
at
them
yet
when
the
day
light
arose
the
english
fought
within
a
semicircular
wall
of
mangled
carcasses
for
grievous
to
relate
they
were
not
corpses
yet
were
they
piled
in
a
heap
higher
than
a
man
height
which
was
moving
with
agonized
life
from
top
to
bottom
and
from
the
one
end
to
the
other
for
the
men
having
all
fallen
by
sword
wounds
few
of
them
were
quite
dead
the
english
were
now
reduced
to
a
small
number
yet
in
the
strife
their
ardour
seemed
to
prevail
over
that
of
their
opponents
the
border
chiefs
inured
as
they
were
to
war
stood
amazed
and
even
shocked
at
the
scene
presented
to
their
view
yardbire
was
the
first
to
deprecate
it
in
these
words
gude
faith
sirs
it
strikes
me
that
this
is
rather
carrying
war
to
an
extremity
rescue
rescue
shouted
the
warden
give
quarter
to
these
men
for
my
sake
i
will
pay
their
ransom
myself
when
the
douglas
vassals
heard
this
they
lowered
the
points
of
their
swords
and
drew
back
from
the
slaughter
commanding
the
english
to
ground
their
weapons
the
latter
consulted
together
for
a
few
minutes
and
void
of
all
dread
save
that
of
being
obliged
to
submit
to
the
scots
they
broke
with
one
consent
over
the
pile
of
human
bodies
and
carrying
destruction
before
them
opened
a
way
into
the
middle
of
the
scottish
columns
nor
ceased
they
fighting
until
every
man
of
them
was
cut
down
the
rest
of
the
english
army
were
in
a
fold
escape
was
impossible
ten
men
could
have
prevented
it
on
all
sides
yet
for
a
whole
day
and
night
did
they
hold
their
tenure
of
that
perpendicular
bank
although
before
the
evening
many
were
losing
their
holds
and
rolling
into
the
river
from
exhaustion
then
the
sudden
immersion
arousing
them
somewhat
from
their
torpor
scores
of
them
might
be
seen
at
a
time
crawling
to
the
side
of
the
water
and
endeavouring
to
clamber
once
more
up
the
bank
but
at
last
they
sunk
back
into
the
deep
and
their
last
breath
arose
to
the
surface
in
small
chains
of
fetid
air
bubbles
no
one
knew
what
became
of
the
young
and
intrepid
clavering
at
what
time
or
in
what
place
he
fell
and
without
a
head
as
these
men
were
it
was
not
till
the
second
morning
when
the
breath
of
revenge
had
cooled
and
after
much
expostulation
on
the
part
of
the
conquerors
that
the
wretched
remnant
yielded
themselves
prisoners
of
war
and
were
all
suffered
to
depart
on
their
parole
with
high
encomiums
on
their
valour
but
these
commendations
were
received
with
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
none
of
them
could
tell
when
they
went
home
how
or
by
what
means
they
were
expelled
the
warden
and
his
men
now
set
themselves
with
all
their
endeavour
to
take
the
citadel
and
feebly
as
it
was
defended
it
cost
them
no
little
trouble
it
is
probable
that
it
might
have
held
out
a
few
days
longer
but
when
douglas
and
his
army
were
seen
approaching
on
their
return
from
the
battle
the
impatience
of
the
borderers
could
be
no
longer
restrained
and
yardbire
with
a
remnant
of
his
olivers
potts
and
laidlaws
scaled
the
wall
in
the
faces
of
the
enemy
who
had
scarcely
power
left
to
cleave
a
head
without
a
helmet
and
throwing
themselves
into
the
square
became
masters
of
the
gate
in
a
few
minutes
so
that
before
douglas
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
of
barns
his
colours
were
placed
on
the
topmost
tower
of
the
citadel
it
may
easily
be
conceived
with
what
joy
wonder
and
admiration
he
gazed
on
this
phenomenon
joy
that
his
broad
lands
and
possessions
were
thus
insured
to
him
of
which
for
some
time
past
he
scarcely
retained
a
hope
and
admiration
how
that
indefatigable
chief
had
accomplished
in
a
few
days
that
which
he
had
exerted
himself
in
vain
to
accomplish
for
the
space
of
as
many
months
the
idea
of
being
so
far
outdone
in
policy
was
without
doubt
somewhat
bitter
to
the
palate
of
a
douglas
for
never
till
this
day
can
they
brook
a
competitor
in
the
field
but
considering
how
matters
stood
it
would
have
been
the
worst
of
policy
to
have
let
such
a
feeling
appear
douglas
therefore
testified
the
highest
satisfaction
extolling
the
warden
head
to
conceive
and
hand
to
accomplish
in
terms
such
as
he
had
never
been
heard
to
utter
glorious
redhough
unparallelled
redhough
exclaimed
he
again
and
again
thou
and
thy
lads
are
the
men
to
trust
the
chief
received
him
at
the
castle
gate
welcoming
him
in
jocular
terms
of
high
chivalry
to
the
castle
of
roxburgh
which
he
took
care
always
to
denominate
my
castle
this
was
soon
noted
by
the
douglas
and
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
governor
house
in
the
citadel
douglas
made
over
to
him
by
regular
deeds
and
instruments
the
seven
first
baronies
he
chose
to
name
this
document
together
with
the
royal
charters
confirming
it
is
extant
and
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
warden
lineal
descendants
at
this
day
on
receiving
this
grant
signed
sealed
and
witnessed
sir
ringan
delivered
over
the
keys
of
the
castle
to
the
earl
of
douglas
and
mar
and
the
two
exchanged
seats
at
the
table
douglas
also
conferred
the
honours
of
knighthood
on
charlie
scott
simon
longspeare
and
john
of
howpasley
while
sir
ringan
bestowed
one
of
his
new
baronies
on
each
of
these
brave
gentlemen
in
support
of
their
new
dignities
burdened
only
with
a
few
additional
servitudes
on
his
right
hand
hero
the
hereditary
claimant
of
the
post
of
honour
he
conferred
the
barony
of
raeburn
and
craik
that
he
might
thenceforward
be
the
natural
head
of
his
olivers
and
laidlaws
to
longspeare
he
gave
temadale
and
to
howpasley
phingland
and
langshaw
when
charlie
first
rose
from
his
knee
and
was
saluted
as
sir
charles
scott
of
raeburn
and
yardbire
he
appeared
quite
cast
down
and
could
not
answer
a
word
it
was
supposed
that
his
grateful
heart
was
overcome
with
the
thought
that
the
reward
bestowed
on
him
by
his
generous
chief
had
been
far
above
his
merits
the
news
of
the
capture
were
transmitted
to
court
with
all
expedition
on
which
king
robert
returned
word
that
he
would
with
his
queen
visit
the
douglas
in
the
castle
of
roxburgh
and
there
in
the
presence
of
the
royal
family
and
the
nobles
of
the
court
confer
on
him
his
daughter
hand
in
marriage
along
with
such
other
royal
grants
and
privileges
as
his
high
gallantry
and
chivalrous
spirit
deserved
he
added
that
he
had
just
been
apprized
by
his
consort
that
his
daughter
the
princess
margaret
had
been
for
some
time
living
in
close
concealment
in
the
vicinity
of
roxburgh
watching
the
progress
of
her
lover
with
a
devotion
peculiar
to
her
ardent
and
affectionate
nature
if
the
douglas
was
aware
of
this
which
the
king
had
some
reasons
for
supposing
he
requested
that
he
would
defer
seeing
her
until
in
the
presence
of
her
royal
parents
there
was
a
thrust
indeed
an
eclaircissement
was
approaching
too
much
for
man
to
but
that
catastrophe
must
be
left
to
the
next
chapter
in
the
meantime
for
perspicuity
sake
we
must
relate
how
this
grand
device
of
the
warden
originated
by
which
the
castle
was
won
and
himself
and
followers
honoured
and
enriched
it
was
wholly
owing
to
the
weird
read
by
the
great
enchanter
master
michael
scott
so
that
though
the
reader
must
have
felt
as
the
editor
did
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
that
isaac
kept
his
guests
too
long
in
that
horrible
place
the
castle
of
aikwood
it
will
now
appear
that
not
one
iota
of
that
long
interlude
of
his
could
have
been
omitted
for
till
the
weird
was
read
and
the
transformation
consummated
the
embassy
could
not
depart
and
unless
these
had
been
effected
the
castle
could
not
have
been
taken
the
editor
for
brevity
sake
left
out
both
the
youth
and
maiden
characteristic
tales
which
shall
appear
by
and
by
but
more
he
durst
not
cancel
when
the
passage
out
of
the
book
of
fate
was
repeated
to
sir
ringan
he
never
for
a
moment
doubted
either
its
truth
or
fulfilment
provided
he
and
his
friends
could
discover
its
true
meaning
but
the
words
were
wrapt
in
mystery
and
when
conjoined
with
the
enchantment
practised
on
his
men
were
for
a
long
time
so
completely
unintelligible
that
all
save
sir
ringan
himself
and
his
echo
dickie
of
dryhope
gave
up
the
hope
of
reconciling
the
given
destiny
with
reason
or
common
sense
as
for
the
friar
he
entered
his
protest
against
paying
any
regard
to
it
from
the
beginning
on
the
principle
that
all
the
master
powers
and
foreknowledge
were
deputed
to
him
by
subordinate
and
malevolent
spirits
and
that
good
could
not
arise
out
of
evil
the
philosophy
on
the
other
hand
taught
him
to
estimate
facts
and
knowledge
as
he
found
them
developed
among
mankind
without
enquiring
too
nicely
into
the
spirit
of
their
origin
for
the
more
deeply
that
was
wrapt
in
mystery
the
more
powerful
was
its
sway
over
his
imagination
charlie
scott
felt
much
disposed
to
coincide
with
his
master
in
these
principles
but
in
all
deep
matters
he
was
diffident
in
offering
his
advice
or
sentiments
he
however
hit
upon
the
right
cue
in
this
instance
and
that
by
the
most
natural
combination
of
ideas
that
ever
presented
themselves
to
mortal
man
the
right
understanding
of
the
prophecy
was
about
to
be
given
up
in
despair
the
intervals
of
silence
during
the
discussion
were
becoming
longer
and
longer
each
time
it
was
in
order
to
break
one
of
these
rather
than
to
impose
his
advice
on
his
chief
that
charlie
ventured
to
deliver
himself
as
follows
gude
faith
my
masters
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
that
we
get
master
michael
scott
to
turn
us
into
fat
owsen
again
or
bulls
or
stotts
or
what
ye
like
then
the
english
will
drive
us
gladly
into
the
castle
for
marts
to
their
beef
barrels
but
when
we
are
fairly
in
we
wad
need
the
gospel
friar
to
change
us
to
men
again
or
gude
faith
we
wad
be
in
a
bad
predicament
but
i
hae
some
faith
to
put
in
auld
michael
power
as
i
hae
good
right
and
gin
that
could
be
done
as
he
seemed
to
hint
by
the
blood
of
bruce
but
we
wad
dowss
their
doublets
for
them
might
we
not
rather
disguise
ourselves
as
cattle
cousin
said
howpasley
i
have
seen
our
jugglers
and
mountebank
players
said
longspeare
disguise
themselves
as
a
lion
a
tiger
a
bear
a
wolf
and
even
as
a
great
serpent
and
dragon
so
that
i
myself
took
them
for
these
animals
why
then
may
not
we
disguise
ourselves
as
oxen
so
that
we
may
pass
for
them
in
a
dark
night
said
the
warden
ay
in
a
dark
night
said
dickie
what
is
to
hinder
us
if
we
but
walk
on
all
four
we
will
pass
with
hungry
men
for
oxen
in
a
dark
night
thus
was
the
hint
given
which
was
improved
on
as
above
related
till
it
effected
the
desired
and
important
event
the
taking
of
roxburgh
castle
and
that
in
the
most
masterly
and
prudent
style
ever
conceived
by
man
they
had
a
small
drove
of
cattle
collected
as
well
as
hides
but
the
disguised
ones
took
care
to
keep
in
the
front
or
the
middle
of
these
in
short
on
the
side
farthest
from
an
englishman
the
one
who
walked
through
the
dub
in
an
upright
posture
had
not
perceived
the
shabby
boy
so
near
him
abundance
of
all
the
good
things
that
the
kingdom
could
produce
were
now
poured
into
the
castle
with
all
expedition
and
every
preparation
made
for
the
reception
of
the
king
and
queen
of
scotland
the
carnage
had
been
so
great
at
the
two
gates
that
night
the
fortress
was
taken
that
the
citizens
of
roxburgh
as
well
as
the
three
establishments
of
monks
and
friars
in
the
vicinity
besought
of
douglas
that
the
slain
might
not
be
buried
nigh
to
the
city
for
fear
of
infection
and
if
this
was
granted
they
proffered
to
be
at
the
sole
charge
of
removing
and
burying
them
with
all
holy
observances
this
was
readily
granted
and
they
were
removed
to
a
little
plain
behind
the
present
village
where
thousands
of
their
bones
have
lately
been

the

when

that
day
our
king
comes
the
water
from
the
time
of
the
taking
of
the
castle
until
the
arrival
of
king
robert
was
an
interval
of
high
festivity
the
border
chiefs
and
yeomen
went
home
to
their
respective
places
of
abode
with
abundant
spoil
having
been
loaded
with
rich
presents
from
the
douglas
as
well
as
their
share
of
sir
ringan
numberless
booties
which
he
always
divided
among
them
with
great
liberality
and
it
was
computed
that
in
the
course
of
that
predatory
warfare
he
drove
thirty
thousand
domestic
animals
out
of
the
english
territory
the
scottish
border
districts
were
never
so
well
stocked
before
for
a
century
previous
to
that
they
had
lain
waste
having
been
entirely
depopulated
and
left
no
better
than
a
hunting
forest
that
reign
enriched
them
and
its
happy
effects
have
never
since
been
obliterated
among
other
things
that
happened
in
this
joyful
interval
old
peter
chisholm
received
a
message
one
day
informing
him
that
the
stranger
to
whom
he
had
betrothed
his
daughter
would
appear
next
day
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
they
eat
up
every
thing
that
within
the
house
said
peter
if
he
will
have
her
it
wad
suit
better
for
us
to
meet
them
at
hawick
the
half
o
the
expences
there
wad
lye
to
him
at
ony
rate
and
if
he
made
weel
through
wi
his
hides
mayhap
he
wad
pay
the
halewort
a
brave
chield
enough
it
wad
appear
but
i
wish
he
had
fawn
aff
the
tap
o
his
humphed
hides
and
broken
the
bane
o
his
neck
for
it
will
be
a
wae
sight
to
me
to
see
the
flower
of
a
the
chisholms
gang
away
wi
an
english
cadger
oh
wae
be
to
the
day
what
is
a
man
but
his
word
father
said
dan
i
think
the
gallant
way
in
which
the
stranger
behaved
entitles
him
well
not
only
to
the
flower
o
the
chisholms
but
to
the
best
in
the
house
beside
ay
ay
that
aye

till
ye
soon
fling

has
gathered
for
ye
but
hark

was
sent
for
who
declared
not
only
her
willingness
but
her
resolution
to
abide
by
her
father
agreement
but
added
that
if
a
better
came
before
him
and
made
her
an
offer
she
would
not
wait
a
minute
on
her
heard
ever
ony
body
the
like
o
that
said
peter
what
trow
ye
is
the
chance
for
that
how
lang
hae
ye
hung
on
the
tree
wi
a
red
cheek
an
a
ripe
lip
and
never
man
to
streek
out
the
hand
to
pu
ye
there
was
aince
a
neighbour
i
had
some
hopes
o
an
he
has
a
good
heart
too
for
a
his
jibes
an
ane
durst
but
tell
him
peter
said
these
last
words
to
himself
as
he
was
turning
about
to
leave
the
apartment
for
he
was
at
that
time
forming
in
his
mind
one
of
those
superlative
schemes
which
strike
dotage
as
plans
of
the
mightiest
and
most
acute
device
but
which
youth
and
energy
laugh
at
this
was
no
other
than
to
be
early
astir
next
morning
and
before
any
of
his
family
was
aware
gallop
over
to
craik
a
matter
of
seven
miles
and
beg
of
will
laidlaw
to
come
and
run
off
with
his
daughter
before
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
an
english
this
grand
scheme
he
actually
put
in
practice
but
met
laidlaw
and
his
jovial
party
by
the
way
who
wondered
not
a
little
when
they
saw
old
pate
coming
gallopping
up
the
fanesh
ridge
having
his
great
pike
staff
heaved
over
his
shoulder
with
which
he
was
every
now
and
then
saluting
the
far
loin
of
his
mare
and
that
with
an
energy
that
made
all
his
accoutrements
wallop
he
never
perceived
the
bridal
party
till
close
on
them
and
till
he
was
asked
by
half
a
score
voices
at
once
what
the
great
haste
castleweary
where
are
ye
gawn
at
sic
a
rate
sae
early
in
the
morning
are
your
ha
burnt
are
your
cattle
driven
have
the
ha
and
the
reids
been
the
fells
aince
mair
and
many
other
such
questions
were
put
before
peter
got
a
word
spoken
or
a
thought
thought
he
only
bit
his
lip
and
looked
very
angry
at
being
caught
in
such
a
plight
but
seeing
will
laidlaw
at
the
head
of
his
kinsmen
he
took
him
aside
and
imparted
his
grand
secret
sides
were
like
to
burst
with
laughter
he
however
contained
himself
while
peter
went
on
but
ye
had
better
turn
a
that
clan
again
wha
hae
nought
ado
at
a
wi
us
but
put
things
to
waste
the
less
din
about
the
thing
the
better
but
how
are
we
to
answer
the
when
he
comes
then
castleweary
that
tremendous
buyer
of
hides
will
hew
us
all
to
pieces
ay
ye
maun
just
take
a
the
blame
on
yoursels
you
and
bess
no
mak
muckle
at
the
laidlaw
hands
or
he
do
what
never
ony
did
afore
him
i
certainly
have
the
greatest
respect
for
your
daughter
but
times
are
hard
and
dangerous
and
i
have
nae
great
opinion
o
marriage
come
now
i
like
to
hear
that
for
ye
ken
fock
maun
ay
read
a
laidlaw
backward
and
if
the
times
are
hard
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
a
very
small
dowry
perhaps
the
matter
o
ten
tup
hogs
aff
the
sax
owsen
aff
hosecot
and
hold
there
my
old
friend
and
i
will
run
all
risks
and
take
away
your
daughter
elizabeth
let
the
look
to
himself
weel
god
bless
ye
wi
her
ye
get
the
flower
of
a
the
chisholms
and
the
best
bairn
o
the
bike
bess
was
a
winsome
and
a
blithe
bride
that
day
and
though
the
wounds
she
received
in
the
engagement
with
the
marauders
were
not
quite
whole
she
danced
the
best
at
the
wedding
and
was
the
first
that
lighted
on
dan
entertained
his
nobly
but
old
peter
was
terribly
in
the
fidgets
not
only
at
the
huge
waste
of
meat
and
drink
that
he
now
saw
going
on
but
for
fear
of
the
arrival
of
the
outrageous
and
and
never
till
his
dying
day
could
he
be
brought
to
identify
his
with
the
stranger
to
whom
he
first
promised
his
daughter
but
for
many
a
day
when
the
dogs
barked
he
hasted
out
in
great
agitation
lest
the
dealer
in
skins
and
his
associates
should
come
upon
him
unawares
sandie
pott
having
found
a
very
kind
attentive
and
withal
a
very
indulgent
nurse
in
the
younger
daughter
may
chisholm
there
chanced
two
weddings
at
castleweary
on
the
same
day
among
other
matters
of
that
eventful
period
isaac
the
curate
mentions
also
a
petition
of
the
friar
to
sir
ringan
that
he
would
use
his
interest
to
get
the
youthful
bard
who
had
come
an
adventurer
into
his
army
replaced
in
his
rights
of
the
lordship
of
ravensworth
and
likewise
that
he
would
grant
him
the
captive
maid
delany
for
his
bride
these
important
connections
had
never
before
come
to
the
warden
ears
and
when
he
heard
the
extraordinary
adventures
and
early
misfortunes
of
the
twain
he
manifested
the
greatest
concern
for
their
welfare
but
the
maid
by
the
laws
of
those
days
was
the
right
and
property
of
sir
charles
scott
who
seemed
unwilling
to
part
with
her
and
she
not
less
so
to
be
divided
from
him
now
that
his
late
honours
became
him
so
well
this
was
a
distressing
consideration
to
the
poet
and
he
would
in
nowise
leave
her
to
lay
claim
to
his
paternal
estate
till
he
saw
how
matters
would
turn
in
his
favour
but
the
friar
still
encouraged
him
assuring
him
that
he
should
be
restored
to
the
house
and
to
the
inheritance
of
his
fathers
and
that
the
fairest
among
the
daughters
of
women
even
the
sole
remaining
stem
of
the
house
of
galli
the
scribe
should
be
unto
him
as
a
spouse
and
a
comforter
but
among
all
the
festivities
at
roxburgh
and
all
the
mighty
preparations
for
the
reception
of
royalty
and
the
spending
of
the
christmas
holidays
in
such
company
the
countenance
of
douglas
was
manifestly
overcast
he
affected
mirth
and
gaiety
but
a
hideous
and
terrific
gloom
frequently
settled
on
his
dark
manly
countenance
the
princess
shameful
and
untimely
death
hung
heavy
on
his
mind
and
the
secret
of
it
still
heavier
his
conscience
upbraided
him
not
with
any
blame
in
the
matter
for
he
was
alike
ignorant
of
the
rank
and
sex
of
his
fantastical
page
but
her
devotion
to
his
cause
and
person
the
manner
in
which
she
had
exerted
herself
by
putting
her
rival
into
his
hands
the
slily
given
to
him
by
her
own
dear
self
her
admonitory
letters
and
all
her
whimsical
and
teazing
inuendos
came
over
his
mind
and
combined
in
rendering
her
memory
ten
times
dearer
to
him
than
ever
he
conceived
that
of
human
being
could
have
been
and
then
how
was
all
this
requited
by
bad
humour
disrespect
and
a
total
disregard
of
her
danger
and
sufferings
the
most
enthusiastic
affectionate
and
accomplished
lady
of
the
age
in
which
she
lived
was
suffered
to
be
put
down
as
a
common
criminal
without
one
effort
being
made
to
save
her
and
that
delicate
and
beautiful
form
thrust
down
into
a
common
among
the
vulgar
dead
knowing
all
these
things
as
he
did
how
could
he
again
behold
her
royal
parents
and
knowing
all
these
things
as
he
did
why
had
he
not
related
the
lamentable
facts
as
they
had
happened
and
conducted
himself
accordingly
there
was
fixed
the
acme
of
his
dilemma
the
detail
of
that
lady
love
and
fate
rose
before
his
mind
eye
like
a
dark
unseemly
arch
of
which
this
was
the
and
there
was
a
power
stood
above
it
that
held
his
soul
in
controul
and
beyond
that
he
could
not
pass
was
it
indeed
true
that
the
spirit
of
his
royal
and
beloved
mistress
walked
the
earth
and
from
day
to
day
laid
her
stern
behests
upon
him
and
could
it
be
that
such
a
spirit
attended
upon
him
in
his
most
secret
retirements
and
though
unseen
watched
over
all
his
motions
words
and
actions
or
how
else
could
the
very
thoughts
and
purposes
of
his
heart
together
with
his
most
secret
transactions
be
repeated
to
him
by
this
holy
monk
nay
though
he
had
never
actually
seen
this
apparition
he
had
heard
his
mistress
voice
one
night
speaking
to
him
as
from
behind
the
hangings
and
charging
him
as
he
respected
his
own
and
her
soul
welfare
to
keep
her
fate
concealed
from
all
flesh
whenever
the
douglas
got
leisure
to
think
at
all
amid
the
hurry
of
his
military
duties
these
cogitations
preyed
on
his
mind
and
one
night
when
they
had
thrown
him
into
a
deep
reverie
the
monk
benjamin
was
announced
i
can
not
see
him
tell
him
to
come
and
speak
with
me
said
douglas
he
craves
only
a
few
moments
audience
lord
of
douglas
and
he
says
that
unless
he
is
admitted
a
visitor
of
another
nature
will
wait
on
you
forthwith
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
douglas
must
my
privacy
be
broken
in
upon
and
my
mind
placed
on
the
rack
at
the
pleasure
of
every
fanatical
devotee
tell
him
that
i
will
not
be
disturbed
but
i
think
not
what
i
am
saying
admit
him
well
reverend
and
holy
father
madman
rather
what
is
your
important
business
with
me
that
saintly
vision
has
again
been
with
me
out
upon
thee
maniac
and
liar
there
has
been
no
such
thing
with
thee
and
thou
hast
trumped
up
a
story
in
order
to
keep
the
power
of
the
douglas
under
thy
ghostly
and
interested
controul
if
i
am
a
visionary
lord
it
is
for
thyself
to
judge
i
speak
nothing
as
of
myself
but
the
words
of
one
that
has
sent
me
if
thou
darest
say
they
are
the
visions
of
a
maniac
in
future
i
keep
them
to
myself
and
do
you
abide
by
the
consequences
thinkest
thou
that
i
will
not
or
that
i
dare
not
abide
by
any
consequences
hence
begone
rash
precipitate
man
thou
shall
repent
this
what
interest
can
i
possibly
have
in
whispering
these
truths
in
thine
ear
did
i
ever
ask
or
hint
at
a
favour
from
thee
or
was
aught
ever
save
thy
own
welfare
the
purport
of
my
messages
adieu
my
lord
there
must
another
commissioner
wait
on
you
presently
and
one
who
will
elude
the
most
vigilant
of
your
sentinels
stay
benjamin
thou
art
indeed
blameless
if
thou
hast
ought
to
warn
me
of
say
it
and
have
done
for
i
am
not
in
a
mood
to
be
trifled
with
i
have
been
bid
to
caution
you
to
look
to
yourself
for
that
there
is
treason
within
the
walls
of
this
castle
will
you
answer
me
one
or
two
queries
truly
and
seriously
that
i
may
know
whether
the
being
that
commissioned
me
be
a
true
spirit
or
a
false
one
i
will
have
you
got
a
private
offer
to
a
prodigious
amount
for
the
ransom
of
lady
jane
howard
monk
thou
hast
had
this
from
i
have
which
thou
hast
rejected
with
the
secret
intent
of
asking
her
in
marriage
yourself
should
circumstances
concur
to
favour
the
device
it
is
false
false
as
the
source
whence
thou
hadst
it
ah
then
have
i
done
my
informant
is
a
false
one
or
if
i
had
it
was
some
passing
thought
which
no
man
can
gainsay
and
for
which
none
are
accountable
neither
is
it
true
that
you
visited
her
in
disguise
last
night
the
douglas
gazed
upon
the
monk
in
silence
with
an
eye
in
which
there
was
an
unnatural
gleam
of
madness
he
drew
his
breath
three
times
as
if
he
would
have
spoken
but
made
no
answer
the
monk
continued
if
these
are
truths
then
list
to
the
following
behest
if
they
are
false
thou
needest
not
regard
it
there
is
a
conspiracy
among
thy
people
for
the
rescue
of
lady
jane
they
have
been
bribed
by
rewards
thy
guards
are
of
course
to
be
cut
down
otherwise
the
rescue
can
not
be
effected
and
if
thy
own
head
is
added
to
the
convoy
the
guerdons
are
all
to
be
doubled
the
douglas
started
to
his
feet
and
held
up
both
his
hands
by
the
blessed
virgin
it
is
true
exclaimed
he
true
every
word
of
it
there
have
been
petitions
made
to
me
for
the
use
of
certain
keys
already
ay
and
i
have
granted
some
of
them
too
i
see
through
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
but
i
sift
the
traitors
i
make
carrion
of
them
if
i
am
rightly
informed
it
may
yet
be
prevented
without
being
made
manifest
which
would
be
greatly
preferable
beware
of
kinlossie
and
list
for
my
time
is
expired
if
you
value
your
own
name
see
not
the
face
of
lady
jane
again
till
you
present
her
to
your
sovereign
the
monk
retired
with
precipitation
and
left
the
douglas
overwhelmed
with
tumultuary
and
adverse
passions
still
the
lady
jane
howard
said
he
to
himself
nothing
but
the
lady
jane
howard
is
it
possible
this
can
be
an
agent
of
hers
but
the
inference
contradicts
the
whole
scope
and
tendency
of
his
missions
i
must
investigate
this
matter
without
delay
he
raised
his
small
bugle
to
his
mouth
for
in
those
days
that
answered
all
the
purposes
of
a
house
bell
and
many
more
every
officer
in
castle
or
camp
knew
by
the
blast
blown
when
his
personal
attendance
was
required
douglas
lifted
his
to
his
mouth
but
before
he
sounded
it
the
knight
in
waiting
announced
a
lady
no
bolder
heart
than
that
of
douglas
beat
in
a
scottish
bosom
nevertheless
it
quaked
for
he
thought
of
the
threatening
of
the
monk
that
another
commissioner
should
visit
him
whom
his
guards
should
not
be
able
to
repel
his
agitation
was
now
wrought
up
to
the
highest
pitch
for
he
attempted
to
pronounce
some
words
of
which
the
knight
knew
not
the
import
probably
it
was
a
command
to
expel
her
or
to
call
in
some
guards
but
before
the
order
could
be
understood
or
complied
with
the
lady
herself
entered
there
she
is
my
lord
said
the
knight
in
a
whisper
and
none
of
us
know
whence
or
how
she
came
hither
the
lady
came
slowly
by
and
the
knight
retired
with
all
speed
she
bore
indeed
the
figure
and
form
of
the
late
princess
but
the
roses
of
youth
and
beauty
were
gone
and
in
their
room
a
clayey
paleness
pervaded
the
features
which
were
even
whiter
than
the
cambric
by
which
the
face
was
surrounded
the
figure
held
up
its
right
hand
as
it
advanced
and
fixed
its
eyes
on
the
earl
but
no
man
to
this
day
ever
knew
any
thing
farther
of
that
conference
the
knight
in
waiting
shortly
after
he
had
retired
heard
a
noise
within
as
of
a
man
choking
and
endeavouring
to
cry
out
and
bringing
two
more
attendants
with
him
they
all
three
rushed
into
the
apartment
and
found
the
douglas
fallen
back
on
the
embroidered
couch
in
a
state
of
mental
abstraction
or
rather
of
total
insensibility
and
the
lady
was
gone
they
immediately
applied
themselves
to
the
restoration
of
their
lord
which
they
effected
in
a
short
time
animation
soon
returned
but
reason
wavered
in
a
state
of
insensibility
for
several
hours
during
that
period
he
had
for
a
number
of
times
inquired
who
admitted
that
stranger
or
who
saw
her
depart
the
men
assuring
him
each
time
that
no
one
saw
her
till
she
was
observed
standing
in
the
and
that
none
was
either
admitted
into
the
citadel
or
seen
depart
save
the
starveling
monk
who
attended
him
frequently
as
his
confessor
there
has
been
another
lady
they
added
begging
admission
to
your
presence
for
a
whole
day
and
night
which
has
always
been
refused
here
in
consequence
of
your
peremptory
order
she
has
at
the
last
resorted
to
the
means
always
at
a
woman
command
tears
and
threatenings
and
she
vows
that
if
she
is
not
admitted
to
an
audience
you
shall
dearly
repent
it
what
another
still
said
the
douglas
no
i
see
no
more
women
nor
nor
next
day
do
you
know
eveldon
what
i
think
of
women
no
lord
douglas
but
well
what
i
think
of
them
myself
which
is
that
they
are
nature
masterpieces
the
pests
of
society
eveldon
i
deem
them
subordinate
creatures
created
solely
for
man
disquietude
the
warrior
is
naturally
surrounded
by
dangers
but
till
he
engages
with
women
he
rises
superior
to
them
all
it
is
then
that
his
troubles
and
perils
begin
no
i
see
no
more
women
might
i
advise
my
lord
it
would
be
that
you
should
give
her
admission
it
appears
so
strange
to
see
a
lovely
and
most
courtly
dame
standing
weeping
at
your
gate
the
very
commonest
of
the
people
sympathise
with
her
and
blame
your
neglect
beshrew
me
if
any
knight
in
the
realm
would
refuse
such
a
suit
no
not
the
king
himself
do
you
think
sir
john
of
eveldon
that
i
can
submit
to
be
ruled
by
women
and
their
agents
i
who
never
held
them
as
ought
save
as
beings
formed
for
man
pleasures
or
his
interests
my
hands
are
free
of
their
blood
sir
john
my
heart
if
ever
it
was
in
bonds
is
now
emancipated
and
yet
by
their
means
has
my
life
of
late
been
held
in
thraldom
say
that
i
may
admit
this
dame
my
lord
well
be
it
so
and
let
us
be
quit
of
her
in
the
mean
time
let
the
guards
be
tripled
and
stand
to
your
arms
i
have
had
strange
intelligence
if
true
there
will
be
a
dangerous
commotion
in
less
than
an
hour
hence
the
forces
of
the
two
kingdoms
can
not
disturb
you
here
lord
douglas
see
to
it
there
is
treason
within
our
walls
who
are
on
guard
the
gordons
and
lindsay
of
kinlossie
men
the
gordons
i
can
trust
let
the
others
be
changed
without
delay
sir
john
and
see
them
consorted
to
the
call
up
the
douglasses
of
the
dales
and
let
them
look
to
themselves
admit
that
petitioner
in
whom
you
are
so
much
interested
and
call
me
on
the
slightest
appearance
of
insubordination
sir
john
did
as
he
was
commanded
and
forthwith
introduced
mary
kirkmichael
of
balmedie
the
impatience
and
mortification
that
the
douglas
manifested
under
this
trial
is
not
to
be
described
for
he
had
promised
to
give
her
information
of
her
royal
mistress
as
soon
as
he
had
it
in
his
power
and
yet
he
neither
had
the
heart
nor
the
resolution
after
the
charges
he
had
received
of
secrecy
to
tell
her
of
her
mistress
woeful
fate
at
mary
first
entrance
into
his
presence
she
rushed
forward
and
kneeled
at
his
feet
crying
in
the
most
passionate
manner
o
my
dear
lord
tell
me
what
has
become
of
my
mistress
this
suspense
is
dreadful
the
castle
is
now
in
your
hands
and
all
the
prisoners
if
such
there
were
but
there
are
shocking
insinuations
whispered
abroad
her
father
and
mother
are
on
their
way
to
visit
you
here
and
what
shall
i
say
to
them
for
the
loss
of
my
dear
mistress
o
lord
douglas
if
you
know
of
her
as
know
of
her
you
must
tell
me
where
i
can
see
her
dead
or
alive
let
me
but
see
her
or
tell
me
when
i
shall
see
her
lady
that
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
but
if
it
will
give
you
any
heart
ease
as
certainly
as
i
speak
to
you
i
saw
her
in
this
apartment
blessed
are
the
news
to
me
my
lord
but
why
then
wo
you
admit
me
to
her
send
me
instantly
to
her
presence
lord
douglas
for
i
know
she
can
not
be
in
any
state
of
concealment
in
which
my
company
can
not
be
welcome
i
implore
of
you
to
send
me
forthwith
to
her
presence
send
you
to
her
presence
that
would
be
a
cruel
act
dame
you
and
your
sex
have
moved
my
spirit
from
its
erect
and
heavenward
position
it
is
like
a
tree
bowed
by
the
wind
and
the
branch
of
memory
is
stripped
of
its
fruit
did
i
say
i
saw
the
princess
margaret
in
this
apartment
you
must
not
credit
it
there
an
incoherence
in
the
principle
or
nature
has
hasty
productions
not
accounted
for
you
must
not
believe
it
lady
for
till
the
porter
opens
the
great
gate
to
you
your
royal
mistress
you
shall
not
see
again
are
not
all
the
gates
opened
or
shut
at
your
controul
my
lord
you
speak
to
me
in
paradoxes
i
comprehend
it
all
well
enough
however
i
will
go
in
or
out
at
any
gate
only
in
one
word
conduct
me
to
my
mistress
hell
has
no
plague
like
this
no
there
are
no
other
fiends
that
can
torment
a
man
in
this
manner
he
blew
his
eveldon
conduct
this
dame
to
her
mistress
she
in
the
great
state
prison
you
know
the
receptacle
of
royalty
and
thraldom
and
let
me
not
hear
another
word
i
throw
him
over
the
battlements
that
next
mentions
the
name
of
a
woman
to
me
the
lady
curtsied
and
thanked
the
douglas
and
sir
john
mistaking
his
lord
frantic
sarcasm
for
a
serious
command
hurried
mary
kirkmichael
up
stairs
to
the
topmost
apartment
of
the
great
tower
and
ushered
her
in
without
farther
ceremony
to
lady
jane
howard
and
her
attendant
lady
jane
rose
and
came
running
toward
them
but
seeing
who
approached
she
started
and
retreated
to
her
place
as
the
two
ascended
the
narrow
staircase
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
square
below
therefore
sir
john
turned
the
key
and
hastened
down
again
the
noise
increased
and
he
heard
there
was
a
stern
engagement
in
which
the
name
of
lady
jane
was
given
as
a
rallying
word
on
the
one
side
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
the
conspirators
met
him
having
broken
through
the
ranks
in
that
direction
for
the
gordons
flew
to
guard
the
apartments
of
the
douglas
not
knowing
what
the
object
of
the
insurrection
was
sir
john
had
just
time
to
shut
a
door
in
front
of
them
and
retreating
up
one
storey
he
shouted
from
the
balcony
to
apprize
the
douglas
else
the
lady
jane
howard
was
gone
one
from
the
ranks
ran
to
apprize
the
captain
but
losing
himself
among
the
intricacies
of
the
entrance
he
shouted
out
lord
douglas
lord
douglas
with
the
utmost
vociferation
the
douglas
was
sitting
in
a
deep
reverie
his
drawn
sword
was
lying
on
the
table
beside
him
he
heaved
it
above
his
shoulder
and
running
to
the
door
of
the
apartment
opened
it
and
asked
the
fellow
who
was
still
bawling
in
the
dark
what
it
was
is
the
lady
jane
howard
answered
he
in
the
same
shouting
voice
damnation
on
the
tongue
that
says
it
exclaimed
the
douglas
in
ire
am
i
never
more
to
hear
aught
repeated
but
the
names
of
women
do
you
know
the
penalty
of
that
word
recreant
i
have
sworn
to
throw
you
from
the
battlements
but
that
shall
not
prevent
me
from
cleaving
you
to
the
earth
in
the
first
place
women
women
nothing
but
one
woman
after
another
i
cut
down
every
man
that
dares
name
one
to
me
in
that
manner
as
he
said
these
words
he
rushed
toward
the
soldier
with
his
heavy
sword
heaved
but
the
man
flying
with
all
expedition
escaped
into
the
court
the
douglas
followed
him
and
was
soon
in
the
midst
of
a
confused
engagement
and
hearing
the
conspirators
shouting
the
same
name
lady
jane
howard
he
took
it
as
in
derision
and
flew
on
their
ranks
with
such
fury
that
every
man
at
whom
he
struck
fell
to
the
ground
the
gordons
followed
him
up
crying
a
douglas
but
the
conspirators
were
the
stronger
party
and
would
ultimately
have
prevailed
had
not
the
douglasses
of
the
dales
arrived
to
change
guard
as
formerly
ordered
and
then
kinlossie
having
fallen
in
an
attempt
to
slay
the
douglas
his
party
surrendered
there
was
a
strong
troop
of
english
horsemen
waiting
on
the
other
side
of
the
teviot
with
a
raft
to
whom
she
was
to
have
been
let
down
from
the
wall
but
the
information
lodged
by
the
monk
not
only
frustrated
the
whole
of
this
desperate
expedition
of
the
howards
but
saved
the
life
of
douglas
for
the
conspirators
receiving
the
unexpected
orders
to
depart
to
the
camp
were
driven
to
make
the
attempt
prematurely
before
their
measures
formerly
concocted
were
ripe
for
execution
of
all
the
circumstances
that
had
hitherto
occurred
the
reflection
upon
this
bewildered
the
mind
of
douglas
the
most
the
manner
in
which
these
secret
combinations
had
been
revealed
to
him
filled
his
heart
both
with
gratitude
and
amazement
and
as
all
endeavours
at
reconciling
them
with
nature
or
reason
only
increased
the
mystery
he
resolved
to
shake
the
load
from
his
spirits
and
think
no
more
of
them
that
he
might
effect
this
with
greater
promptitude
he
kept
his
noble
kinsmen
constantly
about
him
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
the
redhough
also
returned
from
his
visit
to
mountcomyn
as
did
all
the
knights
and
gentlemen
commoners
of
his
party
from
their
respective
homes
mounted
in
their
most
splendid
accoutrements
to
greet
their
sovereign
render
him
an
account
of
their
services
and
proffer
him
due
homage
but
among
all
these
border
chiefs
there
was
none
whose
appearance
attracted
so
much
admiration
as
that
of
sir
charles
scott
of
raeburn
and
yardbire
before
that
time
the
only
attention
he
had
ever
paid
to
his
habiliments
was
that
of
procuring
the
best
suits
of
armour
that
could
possibly
be
obtained
as
the
leader
of
the
warden
vanguard
column
and
his
files
in
line
he
knew
it
behoved
him
to
be
well
armed
and
in
that
article
he
was
never
deficient
but
now
that
he
had
to
appear
before
his
sovereign
in
full
pride
of
array
as
the
knight
of
raeburn
and
the
warden
man
he
deemed
it
requisite
to
have
an
equipment
becoming
his
rank
so
he
rummaged
the
old
oaken
wardrobe
and
at
yardbire
and
from
the
knightly
spoils
of
ages
got
himself
fitted
out
by
a
skilful
hand
in
a
style
that
amazed
all
his
former
compeers
both
himself
and
his
horse
corbie
were
literally
covered
with
burnished
gold
while
the
playful
restiveness
of
the
one
and
the
manly
and
almost
colossal
figure
of
the
other
rendered
the
appearance
of
our
warrior
a
sight
truly
worthy
of
admiration
the
activity
and
elasticity
of
all
his
motions
combined
with
his
invincible
muscular
strength
and
urbanity
of
countenance
and
manners
rendered
charlie
at
all
times
an
interesting
object
but
till
once
he
appeared
in
his
plumes
and
light
armour
studded
with
gold
no
one
could
have
believed
that
he
was
so
comely
and
graceful
a
personage
at
the
same
time
the
very
consciousness
of
his
appearance
and
the
rank
that
he
was
obliged
to
support
raised
his
personal
carriage
and
address
many
degrees
as
by
a
charm
so
that
whenever
the
warden
and
his
train
presented
themselves
strangers
always
appeared
disposed
to
move
their
bonnets
to
sir
charles
whom
they
took
for
a
king
or
an
earl
at
the
very
least
the
arrival
of
these
heroes
added
a
great
deal
to
the
hilarity
tilting
and
other
military
amusements
at
roxburgh
until
at
last
the
of
december
arrived
and
with
it
the
word
that
the
king
and
queen
were
on
their
way
to
roxburgh
and
approaching
by
the
wild
path
of
there
was
no
bustle
at
the
castle
or
city
of
roxburgh
save
by
the
city
dames
and
maidens
for
whom
the
approaching
festival
appeared
a
glorious
epocha
for
since
the
days
of
edward
longshanks
who
kept
his
court
there
for
some
weeks
there
had
not
been
a
crowned
head
within
the
precincts
of
that
illustrious
city
consequently
with
these
fair
denizens
and
with
the
merchants
who
attended
that
mart
once
a
year
from
many
of
the
towns
on
the
continent
it
was
a
time
of
hurry
and
preparation
but
with
the
warriors
it
was
far
otherwise
they
were
ready
before
every
one
being
alike
anxious
to
fulfil
the
part
entrusted
to
him
so
that
they
had
nothing
ado
but
to
mount
and
ride
in
the
order
assigned
to
them
first
of
all
rode
sir
ringan
redhough
supported
by
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
middle
and
west
marches
the
scotts
the
elliots
the
armstrongs
and
the
olivers
were
the
most
powerful
of
these
and
next
in
order
came
the
laidlaws
the
brydens
the
glendenyngs
and
the
potts
after
them
rode
the
kers
the
towzy
turnbulls
and
the
ridderfords
for
in
those
days
every
sept
had
some
additional
appellative
or
these
were
also
mixed
with
a
number
of
smaller
septs
such
as
the
robsons
the
dicksons
the
hendersons
and
the
riddels
and
they
were
all
headed
by
the
doughty
sir
andrew
ker
of
aultonburn
next
in
order
rode
old
willie
wiliecoat
named
also
wi
the
white
the
ancestor
of
the
earls
of
home
a
brave
and
dauntless
character
who
for
the
space
of
forty
years
had
been
a
sight
of
terror
to
the
english
with
his
white
jacket
with
him
rode
the
gentlemen
of
his
own
name
the
homes
the
dorty
dunbars
the
somervilles
and
the
baillies
then
came
the
proud
pringles
a
powerful
sept
mixed
with
a
countless
number
of
dependent
families
headed
by
pringle
of
galashiels
and
after
them
the
gordons
led
by
sir
john
of
that
ilk
all
these
held
lands
of
the
douglas
on
conditions
of
certain
services
they
were
nevertheless
all
independent
chiefs
these
services
performed
but
at
this
time
they
attended
personally
with
their
kinsmen
to
pay
their
dutiful
respects
to
their
sovereign
last
of
all
came
the
douglasses
in
five
separate
bodies
every
one
headed
by
a
lord
or
knight
of
the
name
and
these
made
up
of
the
whole
cavalcade
the
earl
himself
being
with
the
last
party
of
all
and
most
gallantly
attended
the
two
parties
met
at
earlston
but
the
royal
party
was
nothing
in
point
of
bearing
and
splendour
to
that
of
the
douglasses
the
king
and
queen
travelled
each
in
a
litter
borne
by
two
gallant
steeds
these
carriages
were
very
splendid
in
their
decorations
and
constructed
in
the
same
way
as
a
sedan
chair
and
it
was
truly
wonderful
with
what
velocity
they
were
borne
along
they
were
contrived
for
the
use
who
had
a
halt
and
could
not
travel
on
horseback
and
they
suited
the
state
of
the
roads
in
scotland
at
that
period
exceedingly
two
heralds
rode
before
his
majesty
who
introduced
the
various
chiefs
to
him
as
he
passed
and
those
others
of
whose
names
he
enquired
among
whom
sir
charles
scott
was
the
first
the
queen
and
her
maries
also
saluted
him
along
with
the
warden
the
whole
procession
then
drew
up
in
files
until
their
majesties
passed
after
which
they
fell
all
into
their
places
the
order
of
precedency
being
then
reversed
and
the
douglasses
next
to
the
sovereign
there
was
no
time
for
delay
considering
the
season
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
shortness
of
the
day
so
they
posted
on
with
all
manner
of
expedition
and
yet
it
was
dark
before
they
reached
the
abbey
of
kelso
but
all
the
way
by
the
cloisters
the
bridge
and
up
the
of
the
city
of
roxburgh
there
were
tiers
of
torches
raised
above
one
another
that
made
it
lighter
than
the
never
was
there
such
a
scene
of
splendour
witnessed
in
that
ancient
and
noble
city
to
which
the
darkness
of
the
canopy
above
and
the
glare
of
below
added
inconceivable
grandeur
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
light
and
beauty
of
the
universe
had
been
confined
within
that
narrow
space
for
without
all
was
blackness
impervious
to
the
eye
but
within
there
was
nothing
but
brilliancy
activity
and
joy
seven
score
musical
instruments
and
as
many
trilling
but
discordant
voices
yelled
forth
from
the
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
that
old
song
beginning
the
king
came
to
our
town
ca
cuddie
ca
cuddie
the
king
came
to
our
town
low
on
the
border
the
trumpets
sounded
before
and
the
bugles
behind
and
the
border
youths
and
maidens
were
filled
with
enthusiastic
delight
at
the
novelty
of
the
spectacle
they
followed
with
shouts
to
the
castle
gate
and
then
returned
to
talk
of
what
they
had
seen
and
what
they
should
see
on
the
morrow
the
royal
party
was
conducted
to
the
citadel
where
every
thing
was
in
readiness
for
a
grand
entertainment
and
there
the
douglas
delivered
into
the
king
hands
the
keys
of
the
castle
of
roxburgh
his
majesty
received
them
most
graciously
and
thanked
him
for
all
the
cost
pains
and
trouble
that
he
had
taken
for
the
good
of
the
realm
and
added
that
he
came
prepared
in
heart
and
mind
to
fulfil
his
engagements
to
him
in
return
there
was
now
a
manifest
embarrassment
on
the
part
of
the
douglas
his
countenance
changed
and
he
looked
as
he
would
have
asked
for
the
princess
or
at
least
as
if
some
one
were
wanting
that
ought
to
have
been
there
but
after
an
agitated
pause
he
could
only
stammer
out
that
he
was
much
beholden
to
his
majesty
who
might
at
all
times
command
his
utmost
services
without
bounty
or
reward
i
trust
that
is
not
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
now
decline
the
stipulated
reward
for
this
high
service
said
the
king
sire
i
see
none
either
for
your
majesty
to
give
or
your
servant
to
receive
said
the
douglas
and
at
the
same
time
he
cast
a
hasty
and
perturbed
glance
at
the
courtiers
and
warriors
ranged
around
the
hall
the
king
nodded
by
way
of
assent
to
his
hint
and
at
the
same
time
said
to
him
aside
i
understand
you
lord
douglas
you
will
explain
this
gallantry
of
yours
in
keeping
your
sovereign
daughter
in
concealment
from
her
natural
guardians
in
private
but
pray
can
we
not
see
our
darling
alas
my
liege
lord
and
sovereign
said
douglas
passionately
sure
you
jest
with
your
servant
thus
to
tax
him
with
that
of
which
he
is
innocent
the
king
smiled
and
waving
his
hand
jocularly
by
way
of
intimating
that
he
thought
his
affected
secrecy
prudence
at
that
time
left
him
and
forthwith
went
halting
up
among
the
borderers
to
converse
with
them
about
the
affairs
of
the
english
marches
the
stately
and
commanding
figure
of
charlie
scott
who
was
like
saul
among
the
people
again
attracted
the
king
eyes
and
he
went
familiarly
up
to
him
and
said
at
once
well
gallant
knight
how
have
accounts
balanced
between
you
and
your
southern
neighbours
since
last
gude
faith
my
liege
lord
and
king
i
can
hardly
tell
you
said
sir
charles
without
hesitation
there
hae
been
some
hard
yerks
gaun
but
the
last
quarter
stands
rather
aboon
an
average
wi
us
it
is
a
kittle
bauk
that
hings
the
border
my
liege
it
is
often
nae
sooner
down
to
the
yird
than
it
is
up
to
the
starns
again
well
said
knight
i
like
your
fair
wit
and
free
humour
said
the
king
so
upon
the
whole
you
judge
that
the
balance
preponderates
on
our
side
just
now
i
should
think
sae
sire
when
sic
a
clod
as
this
castle
of
roxburgh
is
thrown
into
the
bucket
it
is
nae
witherweight
this
for
the
end
of
a
a
the
kye
o
the
seven
dales
winna
carry
the
swee
to
the
south
side
again
the
queen
hearing
her
lord
conversing
so
freely
and
jocularly
with
this
goodly
personage
came
also
up
with
two
of
her
ladies
of
honour
in
order
to
put
in
a
word
for
says
isaac
with
great
simplicity
women
always
like
to
be
striking
kemps
with
a
handsome
and
proper
man
and
the
bigger
of
bone
and
the
stronger
of
muscle
the
more
is
he
the
object
of
their
admiration
when
sir
charles
had
finished
the
last
remark
therefore
the
queen
smiled
complacently
in
his
face
and
said
you
must
certainly
acknowledge
gallant
knight
that
you
have
been
much
indebted
to
heaven
for
your
singular
success
in
this
instance
sir
charles
nodded
his
head
its
a
that
ye
ken
about
it
my
lady
queen
but
saft
be
the
sough
that
says
it
i
trow
we
were
mair
indebted
to
some
other
place
in
the
first
instance
the
queen
held
up
her
hands
uh
what
does
the
knight
mean
say
my
lord
what
what
place
then
turning
to
sir
ringan
who
was
terribly
in
the
fidgets
about
what
had
dropped
from
his
kinsman
she
added
i
trust
our
right
traist
warden
and
loving
cousin
did
not
practise
any
of
the
diabolical
arts
so
prevalent
of
late
to
accomplish
his
hard
task
and
then
with
a
woman
natural
volubility
when
once
her
tongue
is
set
she
added
turning
to
charlie
without
waiting
the
warden
reply
what
place
does
sir
charles
mean
i
hope
you
would
not
insinuate
that
you
had
any
dealings
with
the
spirits
of
darkness
not
with
hell
directly
madam
answered
charlie
for
isaac
can
never
help
calling
him
occasionally
by
his
old
title
but
i
canna
say
that
we
didna
get
a
strong
hint
frae
ane
or
twa
of
its
principal
agents
no
offence
my
lady
queen
i
ken
by
report
that
your
majesty
takes
supreme
delight
in
religious
devotions
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
always
had
a
strong
hankering
that
gate
mysel
and
hope
i
will
hae
till
the
day
of
my
death
but
there
is
ae
thing
in
the
whilk
i
am
greatly
altered
pray
may
i
take
the
liberty
to
ask
what
is
your
majesty
opinion
about
the
deil
uh
gracious
st
mary
be
with
us
what
a
question
knight
why
what
can
i
think
but
that
he
is
the
great
enemy
of
god
and
man
and
the
author
of
universal
evil
there
i
think
differently
said
charlie
bowing
very
low
always
begging
my
lady
queen
gracious
pardon
that
the
only
tenet
o
my
belief
that
is
altered
at
least
an
it
be
nae
fairly
altered
it
is
considerably
jumbled
and
nought
like
sae
steadfast
as
it
was
always
begging
your
pardon
though
madam
i
am
quite
confounded
said
the
queen
pray
warrior
what
do
you
mean
plainly
this
my
lady
queen
that
i
think
the
old
gentleman
has
been
sair
abused
and
that
there
are
some
na
meikle
better
than
him
wha
have
been
a
great
deal
better
ca
it
may
sound
a
little
odd
in
your
ears
but
i
hae
now
seen
him
i
hae
sat
wi
him
i
hae
eaten
i
hae
drunken
wi
him
and
gin
it
hadna
been
for
the
interference
of
women
we
wad
hae
partit
civilly
but
whenever
they
get
a
finger
in
a
pye
there
will
be
some
ane
burnt
in
the
opening
always
begging
your
majesty
pardon
though
the
queen
crossed
herself
and
counted
her
beads
but
at
the
same
time
bestowed
a
smile
and
look
of
admiration
on
this
extraordinary
hero
who
had
accomplished
such
singular
adventures
these
encouraging
sir
charles
to
finish
his
sentence
he
added
they
hae
frightit
me
wi
him
lang
and
sair
has
my
neb
been
hauden
at
the
grindstane
the
fear
o
him
i
durst
hardly
say
or
think
that
ane
of
a
the
members
of
my
body
was
my
ain
wi
perfect
terror
but
thae
days
are
an
the
bedesmen
be
gaun
to
fright
me
ony
langer
wi
a
deil
they
maun
get
a
new
ane
for
the
auld
ane
winna
stand
his
ground
to
any
extent
wi
me
on
that
score
he
has
doubtless
some
bad
qualities
some
wicked
vagaries
about
him
but
upon
the
whole
i
have
met
waur
fellows
this
introduction
in
spite
of
sir
ringan
endeavours
to
waive
the
subject
led
to
the
whole
narrative
of
the
transactions
at
aikwood
of
which
the
queen
and
her
maidens
of
honour
were
never
wearied
although
at
the
same
time
many
an
ave
maria
and
paternoster
the
subject
cost
them
when
obliged
from
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
desist
listening
to
the
agitating
theme
the
queen
was
never
at
rest
until
it
was
renewed
next
day
nor
even
then
till
she
had
gone
and
visited
the
great
hill
of
eildon
thus
miraculously
cleft
asunder
and
divided
into
three
and
even
after
quaking
at
the
scene
she
grew
still
more
importunate
in
her
inquiries
so
that
there
was
no
satisfying
her
curiosity
on
the
subject
of
the
enchantments
of
master
michael
scott
all
the
time
she
remained
in
roxburgh
when
she
retired
to
her
chamber
that
first
night
she
inquired
for
a
confessor
and
the
knight
in
waiting
introduced
the
monk
benjamin
intimating
that
since
the
capture
of
the
castle
he
had
been
to
all
within
its
walls
the
queen
devotions
that
night
were
prolonged
until
an
early
hour
next
morning
nevertheless
she
arose
from
her
sleep
greatly
refreshed
and
in
high
spirits
and
at
the
was
more
than
usually
gay
not
so
with
douglas
over
whose
countenance
in
spite
of
all
exertions
to
the
contrary
hung
a
heavy
gloom
as
well
as
a
manifest
abstraction
of
thought
the
king
who
was
a
person
of
strong
discernment
observed
this
and
from
some
indefinite
dread
of
the
cause
involuntarily
partook
of
the
sensation
chapter
i
want
none
of
your
gold
douglas
i
want
none
of
your
fee
but
swear
by
the
faith
of
thy
right
hand
that
you
love
only
me
and
i
leave
my
country
and
my
kin
and
wend
along
with
thee
when
the
mass
and
a
plentiful
morning
meal
were
over
next
day
every
one
began
to
prepare
for
such
exercises
as
the
season
admitted
all
lingered
about
for
some
time
but
seeing
that
no
orders
were
likely
to
be
given
out
for
any
procession
or
general
rendezvous
during
the
day
which
every
one
had
expected
some
betook
them
to
the
chace
others
to
equestrian
exercises
with
sword
and
spear
while
the
homes
and
the
gordons
joined
in
an
excursion
into
english
ground
keeping
along
the
southern
bank
of
the
tweed
the
king
observing
them
all
about
to
disperse
reminded
the
douglas
that
it
was
a
high
festal
day
on
which
the
latter
made
a
low
obeisance
and
remarked
that
he
was
only
now
a
guest
in
the
castle
of
roxburgh
and
that
his
honoured
liege
sovereign
was
host
that
his
foresters
and
sumptuary
officers
had
got
timeous
notice
and
nothing
would
be
lacking
that
his
majesty
could
desire
for
the
entertainment
of
his
nobles
and
friends
the
king
then
caused
it
to
be
intimated
that
he
would
be
happy
to
meet
all
his
lords
and
nobles
in
the
at
where
every
knight
gentleman
and
yeoman
were
expected
to
attend
in
their
several
places
and
all
should
be
heartily
welcome
and
now
lord
douglas
said
he
leading
the
way
into
an
let
us
two
retire
by
ourselves
and
consult
what
is
to
be
done
next
lord
douglas
followed
but
ill
prepared
to
answer
the
inquiries
about
to
be
put
to
him
he
had
received
injunctions
of
secrecy
from
one
who
had
in
no
instance
misled
him
and
to
whom
he
had
been
of
late
indebted
for
the
preservation
of
his
life
but
how
was
he
now
to
conduct
himself
or
how
answer
his
sovereign
in
any
other
way
than
according
to
the
truth
as
it
had
been
stated
unto
him
his
predicament
was
a
hard
one
for
he
was
in
the
first
place
ashamed
of
the
part
he
had
acted
of
never
having
discovered
his
royal
mistress
while
attached
to
his
side
notwithstanding
of
all
the
evidences
in
confirmation
of
the
fact
which
he
had
never
once
seen
till
too
late
and
then
to
have
suffered
even
his
mistress
page
to
fall
a
victim
to
such
a
shameful
death
without
either
making
an
effort
to
save
him
or
so
much
as
missing
him
from
his
hand
or
mentioning
his
loss
were
circumstances
not
quite
consistent
with
the
high
spirit
of
gallantry
as
well
as
chivalry
he
had
displayed
at
first
by
the
perilous
undertaking
gladly
would
he
have
kept
his
knowledge
of
the
transaction
a
secret
but
then
there
was
the
monk
benjamin
who
by
some
supernatural
agency
had
been
given
to
understand
the
whole
scope
and
tenor
of
it
and
there
was
dame
mary
kirkmichael
knew
the
whole
except
the
degrading
catastrophe
and
had
unfolded
it
all
to
him
when
it
was
too
late
he
run
over
all
these
things
in
his
mind
and
was
as
little
as
at
any
previous
period
prepared
what
part
to
act
when
the
king
turned
round
and
in
the
most
anxious
and
earnest
manner
said
lord
douglas
where
is
our
daughter
my
liege
lord
and
sovereign
ought
not
i
rather
to
have
asked
that
question
of
you
said
the
douglas
and
i
would
have
done
it
at
our
first
meeting
only
that
i
would
not
trifle
with
your
feelings
on
such
a
serious
matter
perceiving
that
you
laboured
under
a
grievous
misconception
regarding
my
conduct
you
have
not
it
seems
brought
the
princess
margaret
along
with
you
as
was
expected
by
all
my
friends
and
followers
not
by
yourself
i
am
certain
i
say
lord
douglas
where
is
my
daughter
i
demand
a
categorical
answer
sire
in
what
way
am
i
accountable
for
your
daughter
lord
douglas
i
hate
all
evasion
i
request
an
answer
as
express
as
my
question
i
know
my
darling
child
in
admiration
of
your
chivalrous
enterprise
resolved
in
the
true
spirit
of
this
romantic
age
to
take
some
active
part
in
the
perils
undertaken
solely
on
her
account
i
know
her
ingenuity
which
was
always
boundless
was
instrumental
in
performing
some
signal
services
to
you
and
that
finally
she
attached
herself
to
your
side
in
a
disguise
which
she
deemed
would
ensure
her
a
kind
and
honourable
protection
thus
far
i
know
and
though
the
whole
was
undertaken
and
transacted
without
my
knowledge
when
i
was
absent
in
the
highlands
i
am
certain
as
to
the
truth
of
every
circumstance
and
i
am
farther
certified
that
you
know
all
this
hear
me
my
liege
sovereign
admitting
that
your
daughter
or
any
other
king
lord
or
commoner
daughter
should
put
herself
into
a
page
raiment
and
silence
lord
cried
the
king
furiously
interrupting
him
am
i
to
be
mocked
thus
and
answered
only
with
circumlocution
notwithstanding
my
express
command
to
the
contrary
answer
me
in
one
word
my
lord
of
douglas
where
is
my
daughter
where
god
will
sire
was
the
short
and
emphatic
reply
the
king
eyed
douglas
with
a
keen
and
stern
regard
and
the
eagle
eye
of
the
latter
met
that
of
his
sovereign
without
any
abashment
but
yet
this
look
of
the
douglas
unyielding
as
it
was
manifested
no
daring
or
offensive
pride
it
was
one
rather
of
stern
sorrow
and
regret
nevertheless
he
would
not
withdraw
it
but
standing
erect
he
looked
king
robert
in
the
face
until
the
eyes
of
the
latter
were
gradually
raised
from
his
toward
heaven
almighty
father
cried
he
clasping
his
hands
together
where
then
is
it
thy
will
that
my
beloved
child
should
be
o
douglas
douglas
in
the
impatience
and
warmth
of
temper
peculiar
to
my
race
i
was
offended
at
your
pertinacity
but
i
dread
it
was
out
of
respect
to
a
father
feelings
i
forgive
it
now
that
i
see
you
are
affected
only
in
pity
to
this
yearning
bosom
relate
to
me
all
that
you
know
douglas
can
you
not
inform
me
what
has
befallen
to
my
daughter
no
my
liege
i
can
not
i
know
nothing
or
at
least
little
save
from
report
but
the
little
that
i
have
heard
and
the
little
that
i
have
seen
shall
never
be
reported
by
my
tongue
then
hope
is
extinct
cried
the
king
the
scene
that
can
draw
tears
from
the
stern
eye
of
the
douglas
even
by
an
after
reflection
is
one
unmeet
for
a
parent
ear
the
will
of
the
almighty
be
done
he
hath
given
and
he
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
his
name
but
why
have
the
men
of
my
household
and
the
friends
in
whom
i
trusted
combined
against
my
peace
the
king
said
this
in
a
querulous
mood
why
did
you
not
tell
me
sooner
cried
he
turning
to
douglas
his
tone
altering
gradually
from
one
of
penitence
and
deep
humiliation
to
one
of
high
displeasure
why
bring
me
on
this
fool
errand
when
i
ought
to
have
been
sitting
in
and
ashes
and
humbling
myself
for
the
sins
of
my
house
these
must
have
been
grievous
indeed
that
have
drawn
down
such
punishments
on
me
but
the
indifference
of
those
in
whom
we
trusted
is
the
worst
of
all
o
my
child
my
darling
child
margaret
never
was
there
a
parent
so
blest
in
a
daughter
as
i
was
in
thee
the
playfulness
of
the
lamb
or
the
kid
the
affection
of
the
were
thine
thy
breast
was
all
enthusiasm
and
benevolence
and
every
emotion
of
thy
soul
as
pure
as
the
ray
of
heaven
i
loved
thee
with
more
than
parental
affection
and
if
i
am
bereaved
of
thee
i
will
go
mourning
to
my
grave
is
there
no
one
in
this
place
that
can
inform
me
of
my
daughter
fate
her
lady
confidant
i
understand
is
still
lingering
here
send
for
her
instantly
send
for
her
confessor
also
that
i
may
confront
you
altogether
and
ascertain
the
hideous
and
unwelcome
truth
if
i
can
not
have
it
here
i
shall
have
it
elsewhere
or
wo
be
to
all
that
have
either
been
instrumental
in
her
fate
or
lax
in
warding
it
off
do
you
think
lord
of
douglas
that
i
can
be
put
off
with
a
hum
and
a
haw
and
a
shake
of
the
head
and
will
do
you
think
i
should
when
i
am
inquiring
about
my
own
daughter
whom
i
held
dearest
of
all
earthly
beings
no
i
scrutinize
it
to
a
point
i
wring
every
syllable
of
the
truth
out
of
the
most
secret
heart
and
the
most
lying
tongue
i
move
heaven
and
hell
but
know
every
circumstance
that
has
befallen
to
my
daughter
send
i
say
for
her
and
faithful
attendant
dame
mary
kirkmichael
send
also
for
her
confessor
and
for
all
to
whom
she
has
but
once
spoken
since
she
arrived
here
why
are
they
not
sent
for
before
this
time
my
liege
lord
restrain
your
impatience
they
are
sent
for
but
they
will
tell
you
nothing
that
can
mitigate
your
sorrow
if
it
be
all
true
that
has
been
told
to
me
and
that
you
yourself
have
told
to
me
of
the
disguise
the
princess
assumed
then
is
it
also
true
that
you
will
never
again
see
your
daughter
in
this
state
of
existence
ah
is
it
even
so
then
is
the
flower
of
the
realm
fallen
then
is
the
solace
of
my
old
age
departed
but
she
is
happy
in
the
realms
of
blessedness
while
love
joy
and
truth
are
the
delight
of
heaven
there
will
my
margaret
find
a
place
o
that
she
had
staid
by
her
father
hand
why
was
my
jewel
entrusted
to
the
care
and
honour
of
those
who
care
but
for
themselves
and
who
have
suffered
the
loveliest
flower
of
the
world
to
be
cropped
in
its
early
blossom
nay
left
it
to
be
sullied
and
trodden
down
in
forgetfulness
lord
douglas
did
you
see
my
daughter
perish
now
my
liege
lord
can
i
act
the
man
no
longer
forgive
me
and
may
the
holy
virgin
the
mother
of
god
forgive
me
for
i
indeed
saw
with
these
eyes
that
inestimable
treasure
cut
off
without
one
effort
on
my
part
to
save
her
and
without
a
tear
wetting
my
cheeks
then
may
all
the
powers
of
darkness
blast
thy
soul
thou
unfeeling
traitor
thus
thus
will
i
avenge
me
on
the
culprit
who
could
give
up
his
sovereign
daughter
and
his
own
betrothed
bride
to
a
violent
death
and
that
without
a
tear
o
thou
incarnate
fiend
shalt
thou
not
bewail
this
adown
the
longest
times
of
eternity
darest
thou
not
draw
against
an
injured
father
and
king
put
up
thy
sword
sire
the
douglas
draws
not
but
on
his
equals
and
thou
art
none
of
them
thy
person
is
sacred
and
thy
frame
debilitated
he
holds
thee
inviolate
but
he
holds
thee
also
as
nothing
thou
shall
know
proud
lord
that
the
king
of
scotland
fears
no
single
arm
and
that
he
can
stand
on
one
limb
to
avenge
the
blood
of
his
royal
house
my
gracious
lord
this
is
the
mere
raving
of
a
wounded
spirit
and
i
grieve
that
i
should
have
for
one
moment
regarded
it
otherwise
than
with
veneration
i
had
deserved
to
die
an
hundred
deaths
if
i
had
known
who
the
dear
sufferer
was
but
alas
i
know
not
ought
of
the
sex
or
rank
of
my
page
who
was
taken
prisoner
in
the
great
night
engagement
but
i
can
tell
you
no
more
sire
nor
is
it
needful
you
now
know
all
i
am
guiltless
as
the
babe
unborn
of
my
royal
blood
but
i
will
never
forgive
myself
for
my
negligence
and
want
of
perception
nor
do
i
anticipate
any
more
happiness
in
this
world
i
have
been
laid
under
some
mysterious
restraints
and
have
suffered
deeply
already
and
now
my
gracious
lord
i
submit
myself
to
your
awards
alas
lord
douglas
you
are
little
aware
of
the
treasure
you
have
lost
your
loss
is
even
greater
than
mine
it
behoves
us
therefore
to
lament
and
bewail
our
misfortunes
together
rather
than
indulge
in
bitter
upbraidings
here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
queen
who
brought
with
her
the
lady
jane
howard
dressed
in
a
style
of
eastern
magnificence
to
introduce
her
to
the
king
the
king
amid
all
the
grief
that
overwhelmed
his
spirit
was
struck
with
her
great
beauty
and
paid
that
respect
and
homage
to
her
which
high
birth
and
misfortune
always
command
from
the
truly
great
and
the
queen
with
the
newfangledness
of
her
sex
appeared
wholly
attached
to
this
captive
stranger
and
had
brought
her
down
at
that
time
to
intercede
with
the
king
and
lord
douglas
for
her
liberty
loading
her
with
commendations
and
kind
attentions
to
check
the
queen
volatility
of
spirits
the
king
informed
her
shortly
of
the
irreparable
loss
both
of
them
had
suffered
but
the
effect
was
manifestly
not
at
all
proportionate
to
the
cause
she
appeared
indeed
much
moved
and
had
well
nigh
fallen
into
hysterics
but
if
her
grief
was
not
assumed
it
bore
strong
symptoms
of
being
so
she
first
railed
at
and
then
tried
to
comfort
the
douglas
but
finally
turned
again
to
lady
jane
who
wept
bitterly
out
of
true
sympathy
for
the
princess
cruel
and
untimely
fate
and
caressed
her
trying
to
console
her
in
the
most
extravagant
terms
the
king
on
the
other
hand
sobbed
from
his
inmost
soul
and
bewailed
his
loss
in
terms
so
pathetic
and
moving
that
the
firm
soul
of
douglas
was
overcome
and
he
entered
into
all
his
sovereign
feelings
with
the
keenest
sensations
it
was
a
scene
of
sorrow
and
despair
which
was
rather
increased
than
mitigated
by
the
arrival
of
two
more
who
had
lately
been
sent
for
these
were
the
monk
benjamin
and
the
lady
mary
kirkmichael
whom
the
king
began
anew
to
examine
dwelling
on
every
circumstance
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
his
darling
child
extravagant
adventure
with
a
painful
anxiety
but
every
now
and
then
he
became
heated
with
anger
blaming
some
one
for
the
want
of
discernment
or
respect
when
he
came
to
examine
the
monk
who
shewed
great
energy
and
acuteness
of
speech
he
lost
his
temper
altogether
at
some
part
of
the
colloquy
but
the
monk
was
not
to
be
daunted
he
repelled
every
invective
with
serenity
of
voice
and
manner
and
at
sundry
times
rather
put
the
monarch
to
shame
hadst
thou
ever
an
opportunity
of
confessing
and
shriving
my
child
previous
to
the
time
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
her
enemies
reverend
brother
no
sire
she
never
made
confession
to
me
nor
asked
absolution
at
my
hand
and
wherefore
didst
thou
not
proffer
it
thou
shriveled
starveling
were
there
no
grants
to
bestow
no
rich
benefices
to
confer
for
the
of
a
royal
virgin
soul
that
caused
thee
to
withold
these
poor
alms
of
grace
who
was
it
that
bestowed
on
thy
unconscionable
order
all
that
they
possess
in
this
realm
and
yet
thou
wilt
suffer
one
of
their
posterity
to
come
into
thy
cell
to
ask
thy
assistance
without
bestowing
a
mass
or
benediction
for
the
sake
of
heaven
sire
it
is
only
to
the
ignorant
and
the
simple
that
we
proffer
our
ghostly
rites
those
who
are
enlightened
in
the
truths
and
mysteries
of
religion
it
behoves
to
judge
for
themselves
and
to
themselves
we
leave
the
state
of
their
consciences
in
all
ordinary
cases
the
monk
was
robed
in
a
very
wide
flowing
grey
frock
and
cowled
over
the
eyes
while
his
thin
and
beard
trembled
adown
his
breast
with
the
fervency
of
his
address
as
he
said
these
last
words
he
stretched
his
right
hand
forth
toward
the
king
and
raising
the
left
up
behind
him
his
robe
was
by
that
means
extended
and
spread
forth
in
a
manner
that
increased
the
tiny
monk
to
triple
the
size
he
was
before
and
for
you
king
of
scotland
added
he
raising
his
keen
voice
that
quavered
with
energy
i
say
such
a
demeanour
is
unseemly
is
it
becoming
the
head
and
guardian
of
the
christian
church
in
this
realm
him
that
should
be
a
pattern
to
all
in
the
lower
walks
of
life
thus
to
threat
and
fume
beneath
the
chastening
of
his
maker
you
ask
me
who
bestowed
these
ample
bounds
on
my
order
i
ask
you
in
return
who
it
was
that
bestowed
them
on
thy
progenitors
and
thee
and
for
what
purpose
who
gave
thee
a
kingdom
a
people
and
a
family
of
thy
own
was
it
not
he
before
whose
altar
thou
hast
this
day
kneeled
and
vowed
to
be
for
him
and
not
for
another
and
what
he
has
bestowed
has
he
not
a
right
to
require
of
thee
again
in
his
own
time
and
in
his
own
way
the
king
bowed
with
submission
to
the
truth
of
this
bold
expostulation
and
the
impetuous
and
undaunted
monk
went
on
it
is
rather
thy
duty
most
revered
monarch
to
bow
with
deep
humiliation
to
the
righteous
awards
of
the
almighty
for
just
and
righteous
they
are
however
unequal
they
may
appear
to
the
purblind
eyes
of
mortal
men
if
he
has
taken
a
beloved
child
from
thee
rest
assured
that
he
has
only
snatched
her
from
evil
to
come
and
translated
her
to
a
better
and
a
happier
home
why
then
wilt
thou
not
acknowledge
the
justice
of
this
dispensation
and
rather
speak
comfort
to
the
weaker
vessels
than
give
way
to
and
unkingly
wrath
as
for
thee
noble
lord
to
the
eyes
of
men
thine
may
appear
a
hard
lot
indeed
for
the
love
of
one
thou
adventuredst
thy
life
and
the
very
existence
of
thy
house
and
name
the
stake
was
prodigious
and
when
thou
hadst
won
it
with
great
labour
and
perseverance
the
prize
was
snatched
from
thy
grasp
thy
case
will
to
all
ages
appear
a
peculiarly
hard
one
still
there
is
this
consolation
in
it
there
is
no
grain
of
consolation
in
it
said
douglas
interrupting
him
there
can
be
none
the
blow
on
my
head
and
my
hopes
of
happiness
is
irretrievable
yes
lord
there
is
said
the
monk
for
has
it
not
been
decreed
in
heaven
above
that
this
union
was
never
to
be
consummated
man
may
propose
and
scheme
and
lay
out
plans
for
futurity
but
it
is
good
for
him
that
the
fulfilment
is
vested
in
other
hands
than
his
this
then
is
consolation
to
know
that
it
was
predestinated
in
the
counsels
of
one
who
can
not
err
that
that
royal
maid
never
was
to
be
thine
and
therefore
all
manner
of
repining
is
not
only
unmanly
and
unmeet
but
sinful
it
behoves
now
thy
sovereign
in
reward
of
thy
faithful
services
to
bestow
on
thee
another
spouse
with
the
same
dowry
he
meant
to
bestow
on
his
daughter
and
it
behoves
you
to
accept
of
this
as
the
gift
of
heaven
proffered
to
thee
in
place
of
the
one
it
snatched
from
thy
grasp
as
its
agent
therefore
and
the
promoter
of
peace
love
and
happiness
among
men
i
propose
that
king
robert
bestow
upon
thee
this
noble
and
high
born
dame
for
thy
consort
both
of
you
have
been
bereaved
of
those
to
whom
you
were
betrothed
and
it
can
not
fail
to
strike
every
one
that
this
seems
a
fortune
appointed
for
you
two
by
providence
nor
can
i
form
in
my
mind
the
slightest
objection
that
can
be
urged
to
it
on
either
side
it
is
desirable
on
every
account
and
may
be
the
means
of
promoting
peace
between
the
two
sister
kingdoms
wasted
by
warfare
and
blood
which
every
true
christian
must
deplore
i
propose
it
as
a
natural
consequence
and
a
thing
apparently
foreordained
by
my
master
and
give
my
voice
for
it
king
and
queen
of
scotland
what
say
you
i
hold
the
matter
that
this
holy
and
enlightened
brother
has
uttered
to
be
consistent
with
truth
reason
and
religion
said
the
king
and
the
union
has
my
hearty
and
free
approval
i
farther
promise
to
behave
to
this
lady
as
a
father
to
a
daughter
and
to
bestow
upon
our
trusty
and
leal
cousin
the
lord
douglas
such
honours
power
and
distinction
as
are
most
due
for
the
great
services
rendered
to
this
realm
the
match
has
my
hearty
concurrence
and
mine
said
the
queen
i
not
only
acquiesce
in
the
reverend
brother
proposal
but
i
lay
my
commands
on
my
noble
kinsman
the
lord
douglas
to
accept
of
this
high
boon
of
heaven
pause
my
sovereign
lady
said
the
douglas
before
you
proceed
too
far
in
pity
to
the
feelings
that
rend
this
bosom
let
me
hear
no
more
of
the
subject
at
present
in
pity
to
that
lovely
and
angelic
feelings
that
must
be
acute
as
my
own
i
implore
that
you
will
not
insist
farther
in
this
proposal
do
not
wound
a
delicate
female
breast
pressed
down
by
misfortunes
this
is
something
like
affectation
lord
douglas
rejoined
the
queen
if
i
answer
for
the
lady
jane
consent
what
have
you
then
to
say
against
this
holy
brother
proposal
ay
if
your
queen
stand
security
for
the
lady
consent
and
if
stand
security
for
it
said
the
monk
what
have
you
to
say
against
the
union
then
look
at
her
again
lord
is
not
she
and
being
confess
the
truth
now
for
i
know
it
to
be
the
truth
that
never
since
you
could
distinguish
beauty
from
deformity
have
your
eyes
beheld
and
a
lady
pressed
down
by
misfortunes
too
does
that
not
add
a
triple
charm
to
all
her
excellencies
you
know
what
has
been
done
for
her
what
has
been
suffered
for
her
what
a
noble
and
gallant
life
was
laid
down
for
her
was
such
a
sacrifice
ever
made
for
a
lady
or
princess
of
your
own
country
no
never
heroic
lord
therefore
bless
your
stars
that
have
paved
out
a
way
for
your
union
with
such
a
and
and
take
her
take
her
to
your
longing
and
aching
bosom
moderate
your
fervour
holy
brother
said
the
douglas
which
appears
to
me
rather
to
be
running
to
unwarrantable
extremes
granting
that
the
lady
jane
howard
is
perhaps
unequalled
in
beauty
and
elegant
accomplishments
is
she
not
so
is
she
not
so
cried
the
monk
with
a
fervour
that
raised
his
voice
to
a
scream
of
passion
did
i
not
say
that
she
was
and
now
am
i
not
warranted
by
your
own
sentiments
enough
sure
lord
you
can
not
deny
that
i
said
that
i
told
you
the
lady
was
in
beauty
and
i
knew
it
and
told
you
before
that
she
was
the
of
why
then
do
you
hesitate
and
make
all
this
foolish
opposition
to
an
union
which
we
all
know
you
are
eager
to
consummate
yes
you
are
and
we
all
know
it
you
are
holy
brother
what
unaccountable
phrenzy
has
seized
upon
you
said
the
douglas
and
why
all
this
extravagant
waste
of
declamation
let
me
not
hear
another
sentence
nor
another
word
on
the
subject
only
suffer
me
to
finish
what
i
had
begun
i
say
then
granting
that
the
lady
jane
were
peerless
in
beauty
and
accomplishments
still
there
is
an
impression
engraven
on
my
heart
that
can
never
be
removed
or
give
place
to
another
and
there
will
i
cherish
it
as
sacred
till
the
day
of
my
death
and
that
no
reckless
importunity
may
ever
be
wasted
on
me
again
here
i
kneel
before
the
holy
rood
which
i
kiss
and
swear
before
god
and
his
holy
angels
that
since
i
have
been
bereaved
of
the
sovereign
mistress
of
my
heart
and
all
my
affections
of
her
in
whom
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
in
this
world
were
placed
and
who
to
me
was
all
in
all
of
womankind
that
never
shall
another
of
the
sex
be
folded
in
the
arms
of
douglas
or
call
him
husband
so
help
me
thou
blessed
one
and
all
thy
holy
saints
and
martyrs
in
the
performance
of
this
vow
during
the
time
of
this
last
speech
and
solemn
oath
the
sobs
of
the
monk
benjamin
became
so
audible
that
all
eyes
were
turned
to
him
for
they
thought
that
his
delicate
frame
would
burst
with
its
emotions
and
besides
he
was
all
the
while
fumbling
about
his
throat
so
that
they
dreaded
he
had
purposed
some
mortal
injury
to
himself
but
in
place
of
that
he
had
been
unloosing
some
clasps
or
knots
about
his
tunick
for
with
a
motion
quicker
than
thought
he
flung
at
once
his
cowl
frock
and
beard
away
and
there
stood
arrayed
as
a
royal
bride
the
princess
margaret
of
scotland
journeyer
of
earth
where
art
thou
now
yes
there
stood
in
one
moment
disclosed
to
the
eyes
of
all
present
princess
margaret
stuart
embellished
in
all
the
ornaments
of
virgin
royalty
and
blooming
in
a
glow
of
new
born
beauties
thank
heaven
i
have
been
deceived
cried
she
with
great
emphasis
and
when
she
had
said
this
she
stood
up
motionless
by
the
side
of
lady
jane
howard
and
cast
her
eyes
on
the
ground
no
pen
can
do
justice
to
the
scene
it
must
be
left
wholly
to
conception
after
the
fact
is
told
that
no
one
present
had
the
slightest
conception
of
the
disguise
save
the
queen
who
had
been
initiated
into
the
project
of
trying
the
real
state
of
the
douglas
affections
on
the
preceding
night
it
was
like
a
scene
of
enchantment
such
as
might
have
been
produced
at
the
castle
of
aikwood
but
a
moment
ago
all
was
sorrow
and
despair
now
all
was
one
burst
of
joyful
surprise
and
to
make
it
still
more
interesting
there
stood
the
two
rival
beauties
of
scotland
and
england
side
by
side
as
if
each
were
vying
with
the
other
for
the
palm
to
be
bestowed
on
her
native
country
but
to
this
day
the
connoisseurs
in
female
beauty
have
never
decided
whether
the
dark
falcon
eyes
and
lofty
forehead
of
the
one
or
the
soft
blushing
roses
and
blue
liquid
eyes
of
the
other
were
the
most
irresistible
the
king
was
the
first
to
burst
from
the
silence
of
surprise
he
flew
to
his
daughter
arms
with
more
vigour
than
a
cripple
could
well
be
supposed
to
exert
kissed
and
embraced
her
took
her
on
his
knee
and
wept
on
her
neck
then
striking
his
crutch
on
the
floor
he
scolded
her
most
heartily
for
the
poignant
and
unnecessary
pain
she
had
occasioned
to
him
and
the
worst
of
it
is
added
he
that
you
have
caused
me
show
too
much
interest
in
an
imp
that
has
been
the
constant
plague
of
my
life
with
her
whims
and
vagaries
an
interest
and
an
intensity
of
feeling
that
i
shall
be
ashamed
of
the
longest
day
i
have
to
live
indeed
but
you
shall
not
my
dear
lord
and
father
for
i
will
now
teaze
another
than
you
and
teaze
him
only
to
deeds
of
valour
and
renown
to
lead
your
troops
to
certain
conquest
till
you
are
fully
avenged
of
the
oppressors
of
your
people
mary
kirkmichael
hung
by
her
seymar
and
wept
the
douglas
kneeled
at
her
feet
and
in
an
ecstacy
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
i
shall
have
reason
to
bless
heaven
all
my
life
for
this
singular
restoration
said
he
but
for
the
present
i
do
it
with
all
my
heart
tell
me
thou
lovely
cameleon
what
am
i
to
think
of
this
wert
thou
indeed
as
was
related
to
me
the
page
colin
roy
macalpin
he
with
the
carroty
locks
and
the
flippant
tongue
you
need
not
doubt
it
lord
douglas
i
was
and
i
think
during
our
first
intimacy
that
i
teazed
you
sufficiently
then
that
delicate
neck
of
yours
for
all
its
taper
form
and
lily
hue
is
a
charmed
one
and
rope
proof
for
sure
as
i
look
on
you
now
i
saw
you
swing
from
a
beam
end
on
the
battlement
of
this
same
tower
oh
no
no
my
lord
it
was
not
i
never
trust
this
head
again
if
it
should
suffer
its
neck
to
be
noosed
suffered
it
though
that
you
must
confess
and
i
dare
say
though
a
little
sorry
felt
a
dead
weight
removed
from
about
your
neck
you
suffered
me
to
be
taken
prisoner
out
of
your
tent
and
mured
up
among
rude
and
desperate
men
in
a
dungeon
it
cost
me
all
my
wits
then
to
obtain
my
release
but
i
effected
it
swung
from
a
beam
end
quoth
he
och
what
a
vulgar
idea
no
my
lord
the
page
whom
you
saw
swung
was
a
whom
i
hired
to
carry
a
packet
up
to
your
lordship
with
my
green
suit
of
clothes
and
a
promise
of
a
high
place
of
preferment
and
i
kept
my
word
to
the
brat
an
intolerable
ape
it
was
many
better
lives
have
been
lost
in
this
contention
few
of
less
value
i
never
deemed
he
was
so
soon
to
be
strung
and
my
heart
smote
me
for
the
part
i
had
acted
but
the
scheme
of
turning
monk
and
confessor
suited
me
best
of
all
i
then
got
my
shacles
of
mystery
riveted
on
you
and
heavens
what
secrets
i
have
found
out
at
this
part
of
the
narrative
isaac
the
curate
bestows
a
whole
chapter
and
a
half
on
the
description
of
the
wedding
and
all
the
processions
games
and
feasting
that
ensued
but
as
none
of
these
things
bore
the
slightest
resemblance
to
ought
that
has
ever
been
witnessed
in
the
present
age
like
a
judicious
editor
i
have
passed
them
over
suffice
it
that
the
border
never
witnessed
such
splendor
of
array
such
tournaments
such
feasting
and
such
high
wassail
for
why
because
it
never
witnessed
the
marriage
of
a
king
daughter
before
the
streets
of
the
city
and
the
square
of
the
fortress
that
had
so
lately
been
dyed
with
blood
now
ran
red
with
rhenish
wine
and
be
it
farther
known
that
sir
charles
scott
and
his
horse
corbie
bore
off
every
prize
in
the
tilting
matches
till
at
last
no
knight
would
enter
the
lists
with
him
but
the
fair
dames
were
all
in
raptures
with
the
gallantry
of
his
bearing
and
the
suavity
of
his
manners
as
for
the
queen
she
became
so
much
enamoured
of
the
hero
that
she
was
scarcely
to
be
kept
in
due
bounds
and
if
she
had
not
been
advanced
in
years
he
might
have
deemed
she
was
in
love
with
him
in
the
lists
she
drew
up
her
palfrey
by
corbie
side
and
in
the
revel
hall
the
royal
dame
herself
was
sure
to
be
at
the
knight
side
except
when
at
table
on
pretence
of
hearing
something
more
about
his
perils
at
aikwood
and
in
particular
about
the
scene
with
the
beautiful
and
splendid
witches
at
which
as
sir
charles
related
it
with
abashed
countenance
the
queen
and
her
maries
laughed
till
the
salt
tears
ran
from
their
eyes
as
for
the
description
of
their
appearance
the
succeeding
morning
and
the
feelings
of
the
warrior
both
then
and
afterward
when
transformed
to
a
huge
bull
these
never
failed
to
throw
the
gamesome
group
into
convulsions
of
mirth
in
short
the
knight
of
raeburn
was
of
all
the
gallants
quite
the
favourite
at
that
splendid
festival
in
the
hall
as
well
as
the
hero
in
the
lists
in
which
he
six
times
received
the
prize
of
honour
from
the
hands
of
the
royal
bride
and
those
of
lady
jane
howard
who
at
the
queen
earnest
request
was
made
principal
and
presiding
lady
at
the
sports
but
if
charles
was
the
hero
of
those
engaged
in
the
games
his
friend
the
gospel
friar
was
as
completely
so
among
the
gay
onlookers
and
created
them
more
sport
often
than
all
in
the
lists
ever
since
the
various
affrays
in
which
his
mule
had
been
engaged
and
come
off
with
such
decided
success
the
mongrel
had
learned
to
value
himself
solely
as
a
beast
of
warfare
and
no
man
who
rode
near
him
was
sure
of
keeping
his
seat
a
minute
especially
if
he
rode
a
high
mettled
and
capricious
charger
by
the
side
of
a
horse
of
modesty
that
bore
himself
with
candour
and
humility
of
countenance
the
mule
was
a
beast
of
sociality
and
decorum
but
whenever
he
saw
a
steed
begin
to
cut
any
unnecessary
capers
he
deemed
himself
insulted
or
put
to
the
challenge
and
on
the
instant
began
to
lay
back
his
long
ears
and
switch
with
his
tail
while
his
grey
sunk
eyes
emitted
a
hellish
gleam
it
was
no
matter
at
what
distance
such
a
horse
made
his
appearance
if
the
mule
disliked
his
deportment
he
would
have
flown
across
a
whole
field
to
attack
and
humble
him
he
had
borne
his
master
headlong
into
so
many
unpremeditated
and
unwarrantable
scuffles
since
his
return
from
aikwood
that
he
had
bestowed
on
him
the
name
of
goliah
of
gath
and
besides
giving
him
that
veteran
title
he
often
averred
that
he
believed
one
of
the
necromancer
imps
of
darkness
had
taken
possession
of
his
beast
the
friar
had
however
learned
to
distinguish
all
his
motions
and
knew
from
these
the
exact
points
and
stages
of
his
irritation
and
when
his
offence
began
to
reach
its
acme
he
had
no
other
resource
than
that
of
wheeling
his
head
forcibly
around
and
turning
his
tail
toward
the
object
of
his
displeasure
without
this
precaution
the
friar
would
have
been
carried
into
the
lists
every
day
merely
to
gratify
the
spleen
of
goliah
who
could
not
endure
the
curvetting
and
jangling
that
was
going
on
there
and
even
this
inverse
precaution
did
not
at
all
times
prove
effectual
as
in
the
following
pleasant
instance
it
chanced
one
day
that
the
knight
of
kraeland
entered
the
lists
alone
no
opponent
appearing
against
him
owing
to
some
mistake
made
in
the
arrangement
by
the
officers
he
was
a
goodly
youth
but
uplifted
above
the
earth
with
vanity
and
of
his
vapouring
and
airs
there
were
no
end
imagining
that
he
attracted
the
eyes
of
all
the
beholders
and
elated
because
no
one
had
the
courage
to
appear
against
him
for
so
he
affected
to
regard
the
circumstance
he
paraded
the
circle
round
and
round
brandished
his
lance
and
made
his
horse
to
curvette
rear
and
wheel
accomplishing
many
grand
evolutions
the
lookers
on
were
all
beginning
to
get
sick
of
him
and
to
view
his
vaporous
manoeuvres
with
disdain
but
amongst
them
all
there
was
none
so
much
moved
with
spleen
as
goliah
of
gath
from
the
first
moment
that
the
knight
entered
the
lists
that
uncircumcised
philistine
began
to
manifest
a
mortal
dislike
towards
him
the
more
so
it
was
believed
that
he
was
mounted
on
a
steed
a
colour
peculiarly
disagreeable
to
the
mule
optics
the
judges
of
the
games
wist
not
what
to
do
and
appealed
to
the
king
who
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
this
unchallenged
appearance
should
be
accounted
as
a
victory
and
that
the
knight
should
take
his
course
in
the
next
round
and
the
heralds
got
directions
to
make
proclamation
accordingly
but
long
before
this
period
the
friar
had
been
compelled
to
turn
away
the
face
of
goliah
from
this
scene
of
vanity
and
as
chance
would
have
had
it
he
was
in
the
innermost
circle
so
that
retreat
outward
through
the
innumerable
files
was
utterly
impracticable
and
there
sat
the
gruff
uncourtly
form
of
the
gospel
friar
with
the
tail
of
his
beast
where
the
head
should
have
been
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
spectators
for
all
this
the
malevolent
eye
of
goliah
as
well
accustomed
to
look
backward
as
forward
perceived
all
the
outrageous
rearings
and
snortings
of
that
proud
and
gaudy
animal
and
became
moved
with
so
much
indignation
that
he
would
no
longer
be
restrained
either
by
bit
or
spur
soothing
or
threatening
just
as
the
herald
had
taken
his
place
to
make
proclamation
the
mule
fell
a
running
backward
and
the
more
fiercely
that
the
friar
spurred
and
the
more
bitterly
he
threatened
the
beast
of
belial
retrogaded
the
faster
till
at
last
after
two
or
three
intemperate
plunges
he
got
his
head
straight
to
the
white
charger
and
then
in
one
moment
he
was
upon
him
and
had
him
by
the
brisket
with
his
teeth
the
horse
reared
furiously
but
the
mule
pressed
still
closer
to
him
fixing
his
long
teeth
in
the
horse
shoulder
till
on
a
sudden
in
an
attempt
to
clear
both
goliah
and
his
rider
or
at
least
to
leap
over
the
mule
neck
the
white
steed
was
overturned
and
thrown
right
on
his
back
above
his
overweening
rider
all
this
was
transacted
in
a
space
of
time
shorter
than
the
time
taken
up
in
reading
the
relation
and
the
moment
that
goliah
of
gath
had
achieved
this
overthrow
he
wheeled
about
with
a
mettledness
and
inveteracy
beyond
all
description
and
attacked
the
couple
with
his
heels
prostrate
as
they
were
yerk
for
yerk
indiscriminately
the
friar
sunk
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
to
the
head
in
his
sides
and
uttered
some
strong
declamatory
sentences
against
him
in
the
style
of
the
nations
of
the
east
but
goliah
plied
his
still
the
faster
although
he
groaned
as
he
kicked
in
the
bitterness
of
his
spirit
the
scene
was
perfectly
irresistible
grievous
as
the
consequences
threatened
to
be
on
the
one
side
the
lists
were
all
in
convulsions
of
laughter
and
involuntary
shouts
of
applause
shook
the
storeys
of
the
firmament
the
king
laughed
till
he
sunk
down
in
his
litter
and
his
attendants
had
some
fears
that
he
would
expire
in
a
convulsive
fit
the
knight
of
kraeland
was
carried
out
of
the
lists
maimed
and
in
a
state
of
insensibility
and
the
friar
maugre
all
he
could
advance
in
opposition
to
the
award
was
proclaimed
the
victor
in
that
course
and
obliged
to
appear
in
the
next
encounter
in
opposition
to
the
knight
who
had
been
the
conqueror
in
the
preceding
combat
had
goliah
of
gath
restrained
his
wrath
when
this
conquest
was
achieved
it
would
have
been
all
very
well
save
for
kraeland
and
his
white
charger
but
the
mongrel
wrath
once
aroused
was
not
easily
abated
therefore
when
the
friends
of
the
fallen
knight
and
his
squire
forced
the
philistine
to
forego
his
attack
and
battery
his
gleaming
eyes
glanced
all
around
for
another
proper
object
whereon
to
wreak
his
horrid
revenge
now
it
so
happened
that
the
queen
and
her
maries
were
all
mounted
on
white
palfreys
and
as
these
stood
in
the
inner
circles
arching
their
proud
necks
and
champing
the
bits
he
was
moved
with
choler
against
them
and
resolved
within
himself
to
give
them
a
surprise
and
shew
them
the
prowess
of
a
veteran
warrior
for
over
and
above
their
saucy
demeanor
the
glaring
whiteness
of
colour
that
pervaded
them
and
their
riders
his
heart
could
not
endure
and
besides
all
these
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
multitude
were
thought
to
have
added
greatly
to
his
ire
the
friar
who
knew
him
well
said
so
for
added
he
the
shouts
of
joy
and
laughter
are
unto
him
as
a
portion
of
gall
and
of
certes
when
he
was
driven
from
the
prostrate
champion
by
dint
of
club
and
lance
he
straightway
laid
back
his
long
ears
and
with
a
swiftness
hardly
imaginable
scoured
the
plain
to
the
attack
of
the
dames
and
their
strutting
genets
the
friar
soon
perceived
the
dangerous
dilemma
into
which
he
was
about
to
be
precipitated
and
all
unable
to
restrain
this
champion
of
the
philistines
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
o
wretched
man
that
i
am
lo
i
shall
work
destruction
among
the
daughters
of
women
will
no
man
come
to
the
assistance
of
those
who
have
no
strength
of
man
at
all
wo
is
me
will
the
mighty
men
stand
and
look
on
till
the
daughters
of
their
people
are
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
long
ere
this
sentence
had
proceeded
out
of
the
friar
mouth
the
work
of
deray
and
confusion
was
begun
the
column
of
white
palfreys
were
routed
in
one
moment
and
their
gentle
and
affrighted
riders
kicked
off
in
pairs
like
so
many
diving
swans
never
was
there
a
warrior
like
goliah
of
gath
for
he
tore
with
his
teeth
and
struck
with
both
hind
feet
and
fore
feet
all
at
the
same
instant
the
queen
of
scotland
would
in
all
probability
have
been
laid
low
with
the
rest
had
it
not
been
for
the
prowess
of
her
favourite
hero
who
sprung
from
corbie
back
and
seized
the
audacious
mule
by
the
bridle
smite
him
my
son
cried
the
friar
with
a
loud
voice
draw
thou
forth
thy
sword
and
smite
him
to
the
earth
for
it
is
better
for
him
to
die
than
to
live
the
mule
thought
to
prove
contumacious
at
the
first
but
feeling
charlie
powerful
grasp
he
calmed
himself
turned
the
one
ear
back
the
other
forward
and
switched
his
tail
listening
with
much
gratification
to
the
hysterical
cries
of
the
discomfited
damsels
not
so
his
master
who
was
grieved
in
spirit
and
very
wroth
with
his
old
servant
and
companion
insomuch
that
when
he
alighted
from
his
back
and
seized
his
curb
he
exclaimed
o
thou
limb
of
the
wicked
one
thou
emblem
of
the
evil
principle
working
in
the
children
of
disobedience
what
shall
i
do
unto
thee
lo
now
if
i
had
a
sword
in
mine
hand
would
i
not
strike
thy
head
from
off
thy
body
and
cause
thee
to
be
buried
with
the
burial
of
an
ass
the
mule
let
his
ears
fall
down
very
wide
asunder
like
the
horns
of
a
lancashire
ox
putting
on
a
face
of
great
humility
as
he
looked
out
from
beneath
his
heavy
eyebrows
with
many
a
sly
demure
glance
at
the
friar
face
the
good
man
led
him
around
the
lists
in
search
of
an
opening
to
get
out
for
he
durst
not
again
mount
him
for
fear
of
being
instrumental
in
some
farther
outrage
among
the
ranks
of
the
great
and
the
noble
as
he
passed
by
the
king
his
majesty
caused
him
to
be
called
up
into
his
presence
and
asked
him
what
sum
it
would
please
him
to
ask
as
the
price
of
his
mule
verily
my
lord
o
king
answered
the
friar
with
great
readiness
that
beast
hath
been
unto
thy
servant
as
a
friend
and
an
inheritance
he
hath
borne
me
over
the
mountains
of
palestine
and
hath
drunk
from
the
fords
of
jordan
as
well
as
from
abana
and
pharpar
the
rivers
of
damascus
yea
bestriding
that
woful
beast
hath
thy
servant
fought
the
battles
of
the
cross
and
the
hooves
that
have
in
thy
sight
been
lifted
up
against
the
fair
and
the
lovely
the
meek
and
the
innocent
have
been
dyed
red
in
the
blood
of
infidels
money
is
of
no
avail
to
thy
servant
and
he
can
not
part
with
his
old
and
trusty
companion
even
though
the
spirit
of
those
that
are
cursed
from
the
heavens
be
in
him
then
wilt
thou
come
thyself
unto
me
at
the
scottish
court
said
the
king
to
him
somewhat
in
his
own
style
and
i
will
cherish
both
thee
and
thy
doughty
companion
and
thou
shalt
minister
unto
me
in
holy
things
and
shalt
be
unto
me
as
a
father
and
i
and
my
children
will
be
to
thee
as
sons
and
as
daughters
for
my
trusty
and
well
tried
friend
sir
ringan
of
mountcomyn
saith
well
of
thee
and
of
thy
great
wisdom
valour
and
prudence
verily
most
noble
king
i
have
yet
many
things
to
accomplish
in
other
lands
than
this
which
by
the
strength
of
the
lord
must
be
fulfilled
when
these
are
finished
then
shall
thy
servant
come
unto
thee
and
visit
thee
for
good
and
thou
shalt
be
a
welcome
guest
said
the
king
wear
thou
this
ring
for
my
sake
which
i
give
thee
as
a
pledge
of
friendship
and
of
protection
through
my
kingdom
remain
in
the
lists
for
thou
hast
yet
battle
to
do
against
two
knights
of
the
lance
and
the
sword
lo
i
will
even
strike
with
the
sword
and
the
spear
if
my
lord
the
king
commandeth
it
but
i
lack
armour
and
am
not
a
man
of
war
save
when
the
lives
of
the
innocent
or
the
cause
of
the
cross
is
at
stake
and
moreover
the
beast
that
thou
seest
is
as
a
beast
of
the
bottomless
pit
he
hath
antipathies
and
sympathies
of
his
own
and
instead
of
bearing
me
full
force
against
my
opponent
he
may
carry
me
to
make
war
against
women
and
children
nevertheless
i
will
do
all
that
it
behooveth
me
to
do
who
are
my
adversaries
he
was
told
they
were
the
knights
of
gemelscleuch
and
then
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
lift
up
my
hand
against
any
of
these
my
brethren
the
men
of
my
right
hand
and
the
preservers
of
my
life
neither
will
one
of
them
put
his
spear
in
rest
against
me
so
that
the
battle
would
perish
thy
servant
is
not
afraid
to
fight
but
as
a
gladiator
he
is
unwilling
to
exhibit
therefore
my
lord
o
king
suffer
him
to
depart
in
peace
these
reasons
were
cogent
so
the
king
admitted
them
and
the
worthy
and
heroic
friar
was
suffered
to
lead
off
goliah
of
gath
amid
thundering
shouts
of
applause
chap
xi
this
general
doctrine
of
the
text
explained
i
proceed
in
what
remains
of
this
discourse
to
point
out
to
you
three
important
and
material
considerations
concerning
the
nature
and
character
of
woman
these
shall
be
what
she
was
what
she
is
and
what
she
will
be
hereafter
and
are
not
these
my
brethren
matters
of
high
importance
all
things
of
this
world
wear
to
an
end
saith
isaac
so
also
did
this
high
christmas
festival
within
the
halls
and
towers
of
roxburgh
the
lady
jane
had
borne
a
principal
share
in
all
the
sports
both
in
and
out
of
doors
in
the
hall
she
was
led
up
to
every
dance
and
in
the
lists
she
presided
as
the
queen
of
the
games
distributing
the
prizes
with
her
own
fair
hands
to
the
scottish
heroes
and
of
course
crowning
her
old
friend
charlie
with
the
bays
at
least
once
a
day
sir
charles
was
a
most
unassuming
character
and
seldom
adventured
on
addressing
his
superiors
first
but
when
once
they
addressed
discourse
to
him
he
never
failed
answering
them
with
perfect
ease
and
unconcern
and
often
as
is
well
known
ere
this
time
with
more
volubility
than
he
himself
approved
of
once
and
only
once
during
all
these
days
of
his
triumph
and
high
honours
did
the
lady
jane
remember
him
of
having
brought
her
into
captivity
and
of
the
high
bribe
he
had
refused
for
her
liberty
an
if
it
be
your
will
honoured
lady
i
wish
ye
wadna
say
ony
mair
about
that
matter
said
sir
charles
for
mony
queer
fidgetty
kind
o
feelings
i
hae
had
about
it
sinsyne
and
if
i
had
kend
then
what
i
ken
now
if
i
had
kend
wha
i
had
in
my
arms
and
what
i
had
in
my
arms
i
had
nae
borne
the
honours
that
i
wear
the
day
my
heart
had
some
sair
misgiving
aince
about
you
when
there
were
hard
news
gaun
of
your
great
jeopardy
but
now
that
you
are
in
sic
high
favour
i
am
glad
that
i
brought
you
for
troth
ye
hae
a
face
and
a
form
that
does
ane
good
to
look
at
the
lady
jane
only
sighed
at
this
address
and
looked
down
thinking
without
doubt
of
the
long
and
dismal
which
it
would
behoove
her
to
keep
for
the
dismal
end
of
her
betrothed
knight
and
then
a
virgin
widowhood
too
which
was
the
worst
of
all
there
was
an
obscure
glimpse
of
the
same
sort
of
ideas
glanced
on
charlie
mind
as
he
viewed
her
downcast
blushing
countenance
and
afraid
of
giving
birth
to
any
painful
sensations
in
such
a
lovely
lady
mind
he
desisted
from
further
conversation
the
queen
was
still
so
much
interested
in
that
lady
as
to
endeavour
by
all
means
to
procure
her
liberty
without
any
ransom
somewhat
contrary
to
her
opinion
the
queen
reasoned
that
she
was
not
a
lawful
prisoner
of
war
the
douglas
that
she
was
there
being
no
bond
of
peace
subsisting
between
the
nations
and
she
entering
scotland
with
forged
credentials
at
least
signed
and
sealed
in
favour
of
another
and
person
she
applied
to
the
king
who
gave
his
consent
but
at
the
same
time
professed
having
nothing
to
do
in
the
matter
at
length
she
teazed
lord
douglas
so
much
that
he
resolved
to
indulge
her
majesty
before
the
court
took
leave
of
him
but
to
leave
it
until
the
very
last
day
he
however
reckoned
before
his
host
for
now
that
the
abbot
of
melrose
had
conjoined
him
with
royalty
he
found
that
he
had
at
the
very
least
two
to
please
instead
of
one
here
we
must
with
that
regard
to
veracity
which
so
well
becomes
every
narrator
of
a
true
tale
divulge
a
disagreeable
secret
that
is
we
must
delineate
truly
a
trait
in
the
character
of
our
heroine
the
lady
douglas
lately
the
princess
margaret
of
scotland
which
we
would
rather
have
concealed
had
it
been
possible
to
have
done
so
but
she
could
not
conceal
it
any
longer
herself
and
why
should
isaac
and
i
vex
ourselves
about
it
for
one
day
when
mary
kirkmichael
waited
on
her
in
her
chamber
she
found
her
drowned
in
tears
and
with
great
perplexity
and
no
less
curiosity
set
herself
to
discover
the
cause
what
my
dearest
and
most
noble
lady
in
tears
exclaimed
she
now
a
plague
on
these
teazing
battling
boisterous
deluding
creatures
called
men
that
will
not
let
poor
innocent
maids
alone
to
live
at
heart
ease
but
hold
them
thus
in
constant
ferment
married
or
unmarried
well
did
i
ween
from
experience
that
the
maiden
troubles
were
the
most
insufferable
to
be
borne
the
neglects
the
disappointed
hopes
the
fears
and
above
all
the
jealousies
oh
these
jealousies
what
infernal
tormentors
they
are
but
now
little
wot
i
what
to
say
or
what
to
think
for
beshrew
me
if
i
remember
the
time
when
i
saw
my
royal
mistress
in
tears
before
let
me
recollect
no
not
since
dame
mary
malcolm
palfrey
leaped
the
ravine
before
the
lords
of
huntly
and
athol
and
yours
refused
then
indeed
you
wept
and
when
i
laughed
you
struck
me
yes
you
know
you
struck
me
and
that
had
nearly
made
matters
worse
pray
madam
said
lady
douglas
could
you
conveniently
command
yourself
so
far
as
to
bring
a
surgeon
here
on
the
instant
a
surgeon
sanct
marie
grace
what
is
your
ailment
my
dearest
lady
it
is
not
for
myself
it
is
for
you
i
want
him
you
are
very
ill
of
a
quinsey
dame
and
bleeding
below
the
tongue
is
necessary
go
bring
my
father
leech
to
me
without
delay
and
come
with
him
you
have
not
forgot
your
sweet
maiden
frolics
for
all
that
is
come
and
all
that
is
done
well
i
am
glad
you
are
still
in
that
whimsical
humour
i
was
afraid
you
were
grievously
vexed
or
disappointed
at
something
in
your
new
state
step
forth
i
say
and
bring
me
in
a
surgeon
for
i
insist
on
having
you
bleeded
under
the
tongue
you
are
very
ill
indeed
and
the
disease
is
infectious
by
my
maidhood
and
by
your
own
sweet
lady
the
douglas
i
mean
there
shall
no
leech
that
ever
drew
lancet
open
a
vein
in
my
blessed
and
valuable
member
no
not
were
it
to
humour
a
queen
or
a
jane
now
may
all
the
plagues
that
prey
on
the
heart
of
woman
seize
and
torment
thee
if
thou
hast
not
guessed
the
cause
of
my
uneasiness
there
a
latent
devil
within
thee
that
whispers
to
thy
imagination
the
thoughts
that
are
passing
in
my
heart
o
kirkmichael
i
am
ill
i
have
suffered
many
distresses
in
my
time
many
many
distresses
yes
indeed
you
have
my
royal
mistress
many
many
distresses
bring
the
surgeon
i
say
can
not
you
for
the
life
of
you
compose
yourself
for
a
little
space
when
you
see
me
in
such
distress
your
royal
mistress
mary
i
am
no
royal
mistress
now
no
i
nothing
but
a
plain
wife
of
a
lord
or
earl
or
how
do
you
call
that
beautiful
title
while
the
lady
jane
howard
oh
kirkmichael
i
can
not
tell
you
the
half
of
what
i
feel
i
know
it
all
jealousy
my
dear
lady
jealousy
think
you
i
know
not
what
it
is
to
suffer
that
do
you
remember
young
spinola
that
came
to
our
court
from
the
places
abroad
he
loved
me
the
best
after
all
i
had
certain
demonstrative
proofs
of
it
but
do
you
know
what
i
suffered
racks
tortures
strangulations
fiends
tearing
out
my
eyes
pouring
hellebore
into
my
ears
and
boring
through
my
heart
with
red
hot
irons
not
know
what
jealousy
is
was
not
i
telling
your
royal
self
the
last
minute
mary
stop
and
be
advised
you
are
very
i
humbly
ask
forgiveness
i
was
coming
to
it
dear
lady
i
have
noted
your
trouble
these
nine
days
past
and
that
it
was
still
gaining
ground
but
i
can
partly
account
for
it
so
that
with
a
little
prudence
and
patience
it
may
be
removed
ever
since
the
day
on
which
you
was
a
bride
or
the
one
following
perhaps
there
has
been
more
court
and
more
flattery
paid
to
the
southern
beauty
than
to
the
northern
one
it
is
the
course
of
nature
madam
you
are
now
a
married
wife
and
your
charms
must
be
admired
at
a
distance
with
respect
and
awe
the
maid
must
still
be
courted
and
flattered
quite
natural
madam
i
assure
you
think
you
any
knight
durst
caper
and
bow
and
prate
to
the
lady
douglas
as
they
do
to
english
mary
i
will
give
you
all
my
wedding
apparel
for
these
two
last
words
is
not
she
a
mere
puppet
without
soul
or
magnanimity
but
mary
how
gladly
would
i
change
places
with
her
mary
she
has
conquered
after
all
yes
she
has
conquered
margaret
stuart
there
is
no
denying
of
it
to
one
own
heart
gramercy
dearest
lady
are
you
not
raving
has
not
the
noble
lord
of
your
adoption
proved
victorious
and
gained
you
with
all
honour
and
approbation
but
then
the
lord
of
adoption
for
her
mary
think
of
that
the
gallant
faithful
and
magnanimous
musgrave
for
the
mistress
of
his
affections
but
who
died
for
the
poor
degraded
lady
margaret
of
scotland
i
am
conquered
with
my
own
weapons
there
is
no
denying
of
it
i
would
rather
that
one
lover
had
laid
down
his
life
for
me
than
have
had
fifty
husbands
palpably
wrong
i
prove
it
fifty
husbands
how
delightful
beg
pardon
madam
i
tried
the
douglas
hardly
for
it
but
he
was
too
selfish
and
would
not
die
for
me
base
cruel
knight
no
he
die
for
me
even
though
i
got
him
to
believe
that
i
was
put
to
death
and
my
ghost
haunting
him
yet
he
kill
himself
what
a
value
those
monstrous
men
set
upon
their
lives
musgrave
died
lady
jane
has
conquered
and
i
am
i
wish
i
were
dead
kirkmichael
is
a
pity
but
that
you
were
madam
if
ladies
are
to
live
on
these
terms
with
the
world
they
had
better
be
out
of
it
for
you
know
if
the
man
that
one
loves
best
will
not
condescend
always
to
die
when
the
gratification
of
his
mistress
vanity
requires
it
why
there
is
an
end
of
all
endurance
i
managed
otherwise
with
young
spinola
mention
the
name
of
your
spinola
again
to
me
for
the
head
that
stands
on
your
body
since
you
deprecate
the
more
gentle
prescription
of
bleeding
below
the
tongue
and
now
find
me
some
anodyne
without
delay
for
the
distemper
that
is
preying
on
my
vitals
none
of
your
jeers
and
your
jibes
kirkmichael
for
i
am
not
in
humour
to
bear
them
the
worst
thing
of
all
is
yet
to
come
this
puppet
this
painted
doll
this
thing
of
wax
after
triumphing
over
me
in
my
own
country
and
among
my
own
people
after
being
died
for
while
i
was
only
lived
for
after
being
courted
and
flattered
and
smiled
on
while
i
was
only
bowed
to
and
gazed
on
after
being
carressed
by
my
father
and
bedaubed
with
praises
by
my
newfangled
and
volatile
mother
after
all
this
i
say
there
is
she
going
to
be
set
at
liberty
and
without
all
question
wedded
to
one
of
the
royal
dukes
one
of
the
princes
of
the
blood
how
shall
the
blood
of
the
bruce
and
the
spirit
of
the
stuart
brook
this
before
i
heard
of
that
lady
name
i
knew
not
what
jealousy
was
ever
since
that
time
has
she
held
me
in
misery
i
thought
i
had
once
achieved
the
greatest
conquest
that
ever
was
accomplished
by
heroine
and
i
seize
a
noble
prize
how
has
it
turned
out
in
every
instance
to
her
honour
and
my
disparagement
and
there
through
the
unnatural
fondness
of
my
doating
mother
will
she
return
home
and
be
courted
for
her
princely
fortune
not
for
her
beauty
i
am
sure
but
then
they
will
hear
that
the
bravest
and
most
chivalrous
knight
in
england
for
and
as
certainly
as
i
speak
to
you
will
she
achieve
a
higher
marriage
than
margaret
and
how
shall
she
ever
show
her
face
again
a
higher
marriage
than
you
dearest
lady
then
must
she
be
married
to
some
of
the
kings
on
the
continent
for
in
all
the
dominion
of
england
there
is
not
a
subject
of
such
power
as
your
lord
the
earl
of
douglas
and
mar
nor
one
whose
military
honours
flourish
so
proudly
my
lord
and
husband
is
all
that
i
could
wish
in
man
only
only
that
he
is
that
all
you
had
better
i
say
that
he
is
not
prince
of
the
blood
mary
think
of
that
there
are
many
such
in
england
and
there
to
a
certainty
will
my
great
and
only
rival
be
wedded
to
one
of
these
the
duke
of
york
or
glocester
mayhap
or
to
prince
henry
the
heir
of
the
house
of
mortimer
and
then
she
be
yes
kirkmichael
then
she
will
be
of
and
i
what
will
i
be
no
more
than
plain
the
wife
of
the
och
what
shall
i
do
mary
i
go
and
wipe
my
shoes
on
her
as
long
as
i
have
it
in
my
power
tarry
for
a
small
space
there
is
time
enough
for
that
afterward
my
dearest
lady
be
staid
for
a
little
while
till
i
tell
you
a
secret
a
very
important
and
profound
one
it
is
and
it
behoves
you
to
know
it
there
is
a
certain
distemper
that
young
newly
married
ladies
are
subjected
to
which
is
entitled
phrenzy
or
some
such
delightful
name
some
call
it
of
but
that
is
too
long
a
name
i
hate
long
names
or
very
long
things
of
any
sort
so
you
must
know
madam
that
this
delightful
trouble
for
it
is
delightful
in
its
way
produces
a
great
deal
of
animation
it
is
quite
proper
you
should
know
this
grand
matrimonial
secret
madam
this
delicious
trouble
then
soon
goes
off
and
when
it
goes
all
the
giddy
vapours
of
youth
fly
with
it
the
mirror
of
the
eye
is
changed
its
convex
being
thence
turned
inward
reflecting
all
nature
on
the
soul
in
a
different
light
from
that
in
which
it
had
ever
appeared
before
and
at
the
same
time
the
whole
structure
and
frame
of
the
character
is
metamorphosed
and
the
being
that
is
thus
transmuted
becomes
a
more
rational
and
respectable
creature
than
it
was
previously
and
at
the
same
time
a
more
happy
one
although
it
must
be
acknowledged
its
happiness
is
framed
on
a
different
model
this
is
my
secret
and
it
is
quite
proper
that
every
lady
who
is
married
should
be
initiated
into
it
as
for
the
old
ones
they
are
too
wise
to
be
initiated
into
any
thing
or
for
any
thing
to
be
initiated
into
them
now
you
imagine
you
have
said
a
very
wise
thing
and
it
is
not
without
shrewdness
but
i
can
add
a
principal
part
which
you
have
wholly
left
out
and
it
is
this
when
the
patient
is
labouring
under
this
disease
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
she
be
indulged
and
humoured
in
every
one
of
her
caprices
else
her
convalesence
is
highly
equivocal
do
you
acknowledge
this
i
grant
it
and
the
first
case
that
comes
under
my
care
i
promise
to
abide
by
this
prescription
that
is
spoken
like
yourself
like
the
trusty
friend
and
confidante
what
then
is
to
be
done
for
something
must
be
done
and
that
suddenly
that
is
easily
decided
she
must
be
kept
in
confinement
kept
here
a
prisoner
at
large
until
she
turn
an
old
maid
and
lose
a
few
of
her
that
will
be
delightful
eh
then
make
her
believe
all
the
time
that
it
is
a
duty
incumbent
on
her
to
remain
in
that
widowed
state
for
the
sake
of
musgrave
hoh
beg
pardon
madam
i
charge
you
never
to
let
that
triumph
of
hers
sound
in
my
ears
again
it
creates
the
same
feeling
within
me
as
if
you
informed
me
that
an
adder
was
laced
in
my
stays
kirkmichael
you
never
took
any
thing
in
hand
that
you
did
not
accomplish
for
me
this
lady
must
be
retained
for
the
present
till
we
can
determine
on
some
other
course
i
gave
my
lord
a
lesson
about
it
already
but
his
reply
was
not
only
unsatisfactory
but
mortifying
in
the
extreme
it
has
almost
put
me
beside
myself
and
my
pride
will
not
suffer
me
to
apply
to
him
again
my
dearest
love
said
he
i
pray
that
you
will
not
shew
a
a
sense
of
any
inferiority
by
a
jealousy
of
that
unfortunate
lady
inferiority
i
never
had
such
a
sentiment
as
a
feeling
of
inferiority
what
absurd
notions
these
men
imbibe
is
it
possible
mary
that
i
can
have
a
sense
of
inferiority
no
no
quite
impossible
think
no
more
of
such
antiquated
and
absurd
apothegms
as
these
i
will
manage
it
for
you
i
take
in
hand
to
keep
her
as
long
as
i
live
if
that
will
satisfy
you
but
are
you
sure
that
your
brother
will
not
fall
in
love
with
her
and
marry
her
and
then
she
will
be
queen
of
scotland
ooh
oooh
give
me
a
drink
mary
i
am
going
into
fits
ooh
yes
as
sure
as
you
stand
there
he
will
the
prince
is
his
mother
all
over
newfangled
and
volatile
in
the
extreme
and
amorous
to
an
intolerable
degree
disgustingly
amorous
she
is
the
very
sort
of
food
for
his
passion
then
her
princely
fortune
and
the
peace
of
the
two
realms
oh
give
me
another
drink
mary
and
bathe
my
hands
and
my
brow
that
is
kindly
done
queen
of
scotland
then
i
must
pay
court
to
her
perhaps
be
preferred
as
lady
of
the
no
no
to
the
scottish
court
she
not
be
calm
my
sweet
lady
i
have
it
you
shall
assume
your
character
once
more
pay
court
to
her
seduce
her
and
have
her
disgraced
what
did
you
say
kirkmichael
repeat
that
again
what
did
you
say
about
disgracing
i
am
so
very
o
no
that
scheme
will
not
do
it
will
end
ill
it
will
end
ill
you
are
lady
douglas
now
not
the
maiden
princess
why
i
will
get
her
married
to
one
of
your
footmen
for
you
that
will
do
prithee
speak
of
things
possible
and
within
some
bounds
of
probability
if
she
were
but
married
to
a
knight
but
one
step
below
my
lord
in
dignity
i
would
be
satisfied
nay
were
that
step
only
ideal
it
would
give
my
heart
content
is
that
then
so
much
to
make
such
a
pother
about
i
will
accomplish
it
in
two
days
so
difficult
to
get
a
maid
of
her
complexion
to
marry
difficulty
in
fattening
a
pig
baiting
a
hook
for
a
bagrel
a
stickleback
a
perch
i
do
it
in
two
days
in
one
day
in
half
a
day
else
never
call
me
mary
kirkmichael
of
balmedie
again
difficulty
in
marrying
a
maid
with
light
blue
eyes
golden
locks
and
rosy
cheeks
with
a
languishing
smile
always
on
her
countenance
and
that
maid
an
english
one
too
peugh
goodbye
my
lady
lady
black
douglas
i
off
opening
the
door
again
it
is
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
for
any
gentleman
not
to
for
his
mistress
i
say
it
is
young
spinola
would
have
died
for
me
cheerfully
if
i
would
have
suffered
him
that
he
would
goodbye
madam
mary
was
as
busy
all
the
remaining
part
of
that
day
as
ever
was
a
bee
in
a
meadow
she
had
private
business
with
the
queen
and
had
art
or
interest
enough
to
get
two
private
audiences
she
had
business
with
the
lady
jane
howard
a
word
to
say
to
the
king
and
two
or
three
to
the
lord
douglas
but
it
is
a
great
loss
that
these
important
disclosures
can
not
be
imparted
here
for
every
word
that
she
told
to
each
of
them
was
a
profound
secret
not
a
word
of
it
ever
to
be
repeated
till
death
what
a
loss
for
posterity
it
had
one
quality
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
all
this
important
disclosure
but
an
ingenious
lie
by
a
woman
is
much
more
interesting
than
one
of
her
true
stories
there
was
however
one
of
mary
kirkmichael
secrets
came
to
light
though
none
of
those
and
from
the
complexion
of
that
a
good
guess
may
be
made
at
the
matter
of
all
the
rest
sir
charles
scott
alias
muckle
charlie
of
yardbire
was
standing
at
the
head
of
his
olivers
his
grimy
potts
and
his
laidlaws
in
all
amounting
now
to
brave
and
well
appointed
soldiers
he
had
them
all
dressed
out
in
their
best
light
uniform
consisting
of
jackets
with
the
hair
outside
buckskin
breeches
tanned
white
as
snow
with
the
hair
inside
blue
bonnets
as
broad
as
the
rim
of
a
lady
spinning
wheel
and
clouted
shoes
he
was
training
them
to
some
evolutions
for
a
grand
parade
before
the
king
and
was
himself
dressed
in
his
splendid
battle
array
with
his
plumes
and
tassels
of
gold
his
bonnet
was
of
the
form
of
a
turban
and
his
tall
nodding
plumes
consisted
of
three
fox
tails
two
of
them
dyed
black
and
the
middle
one
crimson
a
goodlier
sight
than
sir
charles
at
the
head
of
his
borderers
no
eye
of
man
or
woman
either
ever
beheld
as
he
stood
thus
giving
the
word
of
command
and
brandishing
the
eskdale
souple
by
way
of
example
in
the
great
square
in
the
middle
of
the
fortress
a
little
maid
came
suddenly
to
his
side
and
touched
him
charles
was
extending
his
voice
at
the
time
and
the
interruption
made
him
start
inordinately
and
cut
a
loud
syllable
short
in
the
middle
the
maid
made
a
low
courtesy
while
charles
stooped
forward
and
looked
at
her
as
a
man
does
who
has
dropt
a
curious
gem
or

billy
baneless
a
tales

nae

he
and
he
was
a
right
auldfarrant
man
but
as
this
talk
was
going
on
among
the
borderers
sir
charles
as
before
said
was
introduced
into
a
private
chamber
where
sat
no
less
a
dame
than
the
officious
and
important
lady
of
all
close
secrets
mistress
mary
kirkmichael
of
balmedie
who
rose
and
made
three
low
courtesies
and
then
with
an
affected
faultering
tongue
and
downcast
look
addressed
sir
charles
as
follows
most
noble
and
gallant
knight
hem
pardon
a
modest
and
diffident
maiden
sir
knight
pink
of
all
chivalry
and
hero
of
the
border
i
say
be
so
generous
as
to
forgive
the
zeal
of
a
blushing
virgin
for
thus
presuming
to
interrupt
your
warrior
sir
charles
bowed
but
o
knight
hem
there
is
a
plot
laying
or
laid
against
your
freedom
pray
may
i
take
the
liberty
to
ask
are
you
free
of
any
love
engagement
perfectly
so
madam
at
hem
at
my
service
come
that
is
so
far
well
you
could
not
then
possibly
have
any
objections
to
a
young
lady
of
or
thereby
nobly
descended
heir
to
seven
ploughgates
of
land
and
five
and
most
violently
in
love
with
you
i
maun
see
her
first
and
hear
her
speak
said
the
knight
and

be
scots
or
english

that

her
and
heard
her
speak
said
the
dame
and
suppose
she
was
of
fife
blood
and
that
her
name
was
mary
kirkmichael
what
would
you
then
say
against
her
nothing
at
all
madam
said
sir
charles
bowing
extremely
low
do
you
then
consent
to
accept
of
such
a
one
for
your
lady
how
can
i
possibly
tell
let
me
see
her
o
sir
charles
gallant
and
generous
knight

not
force
a
young
blushing
virgin
to
disclose
what
she
would
gladly
conceal
you
see
her
sir
charles
you
see
her
and
hear
her
speak

see
her
kneeling
at
your
feet

and
generous
knight
you
see
her
and
you
hear
her
and
what
hero
can
withstand
that
oh

charles
hout

cried
sir
charles
interrupting
her
and
raising
her
gently
with
both
hands
hout

athegither
sweet
lady
ye
may
be
very
weel
and
ye
are
very
weel
for
ought
that
i
see
but
troth
ye
ken
a
man
maun
do
ae
thing
afore
another
and
a
woman
too
ye
deserve
muckle
better
than

likes
o

but
i
dinna
incline
marriage
and
mair
than
that
i
hae
nae
time
to
spare
ah
sir
charles
you
should
not
be
so
cruel
you
should
think
better
of
the
fair
sex
sir
charles
look
at
this
face
what
objections
have
you
to
it
sir
charles
the
face
is
weel
enough
but
it
will
maybe
change
the
last
blooming
face
that
took
me
in
turned
put
a
very
different
article
the
next
day
ah
lady
ye
little
ken
what
i
hae
suffered
by
women
and
witchcraft
or
ye
wadna
bid
me
think
weel
o
them
well
knight
since
i
can
not
melt
your
heart
i
must
tell
you
that
there
is
a
plot
against
your
liberty
and
you
will
be
a
married
man
before
to
morrow
night
it
is
a
grand
plot
and
i
am
convinced
it
is
made
solely
to
entrap
you
to
marry
an
english
heiress
that
is
a
captive
here
who
is
fallen
so
deeply
in
love
with
you
that
if
she
does
not
attain
you
for
her
lover
and
husband
her
heart
will
break
she
has
made
her
case
known
to
the
queen
and
i
have
come
by
it
therefore
sir
knight
as
you
value
my
life
keep
this
a
secret
i
thought
it
a
pity
not
to
keep
you
out
of
english
connections
therefore
i
sent
for
you
privily
to
offer
you
my
own
hand
and
then
you
could
get
off
on
the
score
of
engagement
thank
you
kindly
madam
well
sir
on
pretence
of
an
appendage
to
the
marriage
of
the
favourite
daughter
with
the
greatest
nobleman
of
the
land
before
the
festival
conclude
it
is
agreed
on
that
there
are
to
be
a
number
of
weddings
beside
which
are
all
to
be
richly
endowed
the
ladies
are
to
choose
among
the
heroes
of
the
games
and
this
lady
jane
howard
is
going
to
make
choice
of
you
and
the
law
is
to
be
framed
in
such
a
manner
that
there
will
be
no
evading
it
with
honour
you
have
been
a
mortal
enemy
to
the
english
so
have
they
to
you
had
not
you
better
then
avoid
the
connection
by
a
previous
marriage
or
an
engagement
say
i
think
i
rather
take
chance
with
your
leave
madam
always
begging
your
pardon
ye
see
but
depend
on
it
i
keep
your
secret
and
am
indebted
to
you
for
your
kind
intentions
i
take
chance
they
winna
surely
force
a
wife
on
ane
whether
he
will
or
no
perhaps
not
one
who
does
incline
and
has
not
to
to
be
married
may
be
excused
tell
me
seriously
surely
you
will
never
think
of
accepting
of
her
it
is
time
to
decide
about
that
when
aince
i
get
the
offer
i
can
hardly
trow
what
ye
say
is
true
but
if
the
king
and
the
warden
will
hae
it
sae
ye
ken
what
can
a
body
do
ah
there
it
is
cruel
sir
charles
but
you
know
you
really
have
not
a
minute
to
for
marriage
and
the
want
of
is
still
worse
i
have
told
you
sir
knight
and
the
plot
will
be
accomplished
i
would
you
would
break
her
heart
and
absolutely
refuse
her
for
i
hate
the
rosy
minx
but
three
earldoms
and
nine
hundred
thousand
marks
go
far
ah
me
goodbye
noble
knight
be
secret
for
my
sake
sir
charles
returned
to
his
men
in
the
great
square
laughing
in
his
sleeve
all
the
way
he
spoke
some
to
himself
likewise
but
it
was
only
one
short
sentence
which
was
this
three
earldoms
and
nine
hundred
thousand
marks
gudefaith
corbie
will
be
astonished
it
was
reported
afterwards
that
this
grand
story
of
mary
to
sir
charles
was
was
nothing
at
all
in
comparison
with
what
she
told
to
lady
jane
of
flames
and
darts
heroism
royal
favour
and
distinction
and
finally
of
endless
captivity
in
the
event
of
utter
rejection
however
that
was
when
the
troops
assembled
around
the
fortress
in
the
evening
and
the
leaders
in
the
hall
proclamations
were
made
in
every
quarter
setting
forth
that
all
the
champions
who
had
gained
prizes
since
the
commencement
of
the
christmas
games
were
to
meet
together
and
contend
at
the
same
exercises
before
the
king
for
other
prizes
of
higher
value
and
farther
that
every
successful
candidate
should
have
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
his
mistress
hand
in
marriage
with
rich
dowries
honours
manors
and
privileges
to
be
conferred
by
the
king
and
queen
who
at
the
same
time
gave
forth
their
peremptory
commands
that
these
gallants
should
meet
with
no
denial
and
this
on
pain
of
forfeiting
the
royal
favour
and
protection
not
only
towards
the
dame
so
refusing
but
likewise
to
her
parents
guardians
and
other
relations
never
was
there
a
proclamation
issued
that
made
such
a
deray
among
the
fair
sex
as
this
all
the
beauty
of
the
lowlands
of
scotland
was
assembled
at
this
royal
festival
the
city
of
roxburgh
and
the
town
of
kelso
were
full
of
visitors
choke
full
of
them
there
were
ladies
in
every
house
beside
the
inmates
and
generally
speaking
three
an
for
every
male
whether
in
the
city
or
suburbs
yet
for
all
these
lovely
women
of
high
rank
and
accomplishments
none
else
fled
from
the
consequences
of
the
mandate
but
one
alone
who
dreaded
a
rival
being
preferred
a
proof
how
little
averse
the
ladies
of
that
age
were
to
the
bonds
of
matrimony
such
a
night
as
that
was
in
the
city
there
were
running
to
and
fro
rapping
at
doors
and
calling
of
names
during
the
whole
night
it
was
a
terrible
night
for
the
dressmakers
for
there
was
such
a
run
upon
them
and
they
had
so
much
ado
that
they
got
nothing
done
at
all
except
the
receiving
of
orders
which
there
was
no
time
to
execute
next
morning
at
eight
of
the
day
by
the
abbey
bell
the
multitude
were
assembled
when
the
names
of
the
former
heroes
were
all
called
over
but
only
sixteen
appeared
although
stood
on
the
list
the
candidates
were
then
all
taken
into
an
apartment
by
themselves
and
treated
with
viands
and
wines
with
whatever
else
they
required
there
also
they
were
instructed
in
the
laws
of
the
game
every
one
was
obliged
to
contend
at
every
one
of
the
exercises
and
the
conqueror
in
each
was
to
retire
into
the
apartment
of
the
ladies
where
they
were
all
placed
in
a
circle
lay
his
prize
at
his
mistress
feet
and
retire
again
to
the
sports
without
uttering
a
word
the
exercises
were
held
on
the
large
plain
south
of
the
teviot
so
that
they
were
beheld
by
the
whole
multitude
without
any
inconveniency
the
flowers
of
the
land
also
beheld
from
their
apartment
in
the
castle
although
no
one
saw
them
in
return
save
the
fortunate
contenders
in
the
field
the
first
trial
was
a
foot
race
for
a
chain
of
gold
given
by
the
lady
douglas
and
all
the
sixteen
being
obliged
to
run
the
sport
afforded
by
the
race
was
excellent
for
the
eager
desire
to
be
foremost
acted
not
more
powerfully
to
urge
the
candidates
to
exertion
than
the
dread
of
being
the
last
so
that
the
two
hindmost
were
straining
every
nerve
and
gasping
as
voraciously
for
breath
as
the
two
foremost
sir
charles
scott
took
the
lead
leaving
the
rest
quite
behind
so
far
that
every
one
thought
he
would
gain
with
all
manner
of
ease
and
they
began
to
hail
him
as
conqueror
but
owing
to
his
great
weight
he
lost
breath
and
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
the
poet
made
by
him
and
won
the
prize
which
he
took
with
a
proud
and
a
joyful
heart
and
laid
at
the
feet
of
delany
bauchling
shurf
exclaimed
sir
charles
laughing
when
he
saw
the
poet
passing
his
elbow
useless
bauchling
shurf
an
i
had
kend
i
wad
hae
letten
ye
lie
and
been
singit
to
an
izle
in
the
low
ravensworth
knight
i
think
ye
hae
lost
cried
one
i
think
sae
too
said
charles
i
liket
aye
better
to
rin
ahint
an
englishman
than
afore
him
a
my
life
the
next
game
given
out
was
a
trial
in
leaping
for
a
pair
of
bracelets
clasped
with
gold
and
set
with
jewels
given
by
the
queen
these
also
the
poet
won
and
laid
at
delany
feet
sir
charles
won
three
one
for
tilting
on
horseback
one
for
wrestling
and
one
for
pitching
the
iron
bar
and
he
laid
all
the
three
prizes
at
the
feet
of
lady
jane
howard
two
lords
won
each
of
them
two
prizes
and
other
two
knights
won
each
of
them
one
and
all
unknown
to
one
another
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
lady
jane
howard
when
the
sports
of
the
day
were
finished
the
seven
conquerors
all
crowned
with
laurel
and
gorgeously
arrayed
were
conducted
to
the
gallery
where
the
ladies
still
remained
and
after
walking
round
the
room
to
the
sound
of
triumphal
music
they
were
desired
to
kneel
one
by
one
in
the
order
in
which
they
had
entered
before
and
each
to
invoke
his
mistress
pity
in
his
own
terms
it
fell
to
the
poet
lot
to
kneel
first
who
stretched
forth
his
hands
toward
a
certain
point
in
the
room
and
expressed
himself
as
follows
o
lovely
darling
of
my
soul
in
whom
my
every
hope
is
centered
at
whose
feet
i
laid
my
honours
down
this
laurel
wreath
i
also
consecrate
to
thee
by
all
the
love
that
i
have
borne
for
thee
the
pains
that
i
have
suffered
i
conjure
you
to
raise
me
up
and
say
thou
wilt
be
mine
else
here
kneel
till
doomsday
a
pause
ensued
the
king
and
his
nobles
looked
on
in
breathless
curiosity
for
they
knew
not
where
he
had
bestowed
his
favours
the
dames
also
gazed
in
envious
silence
and
in
hopes
that
the
supplicant
would
be
refused
he
soon
himself
began
to
dread
what
they
hoped
his
countenance
changed
the
wild
lustre
of
his
eye
faded
and
he
began
to
look
around
to
see
where
he
could
get
a
sword
on
which
to
fall
and
kill
himself
he
cast
one
other
pitiful
look
to
delany
but
she
deigned
no
movement
to
his
relief
still
keeping
her
seat
though
visibly
in
great
agitation
but
at
length
when
hope
was
extinct
in
his
bosom
there
appeared
one
to
his
relief
this
was
no
other
than
his
old
rival
the
gospel
friar
who
had
been
admitted
in
an
official
capacity
in
order
to
join
hands
and
bless
unions
if
any
such
chanced
to
be
agreed
on
he
was
standing
ruminating
behind
backs
but
seeing
the
first
offer
about
to
be
rejected
and
aware
of
the
force
of
example
whether
good
or
bad
and
how
little
chance
he
had
of
employment
that
day
if
the
first
effort
misgave
he
stepped
briskly
up
to
delany
and
taking
her
hand
said
lo
my
daughter
have
not
i
travelled
for
thee
in
pain
and
yearned
over
thee
as
a
mother
yearneth
over
the
son
of
her
youth
why
wilt
thou
break
my
heart
and
the
heart
of
him
that
burneth
for
thy
love
delany
then
rose
and
with
trembling
step
came
toward
her
lover
led
by
the
grotesque
form
of
the
good
friar
the
tears
gushed
from
the
poet
eyes
as
she
lifted
the
laurel
crown
from
the
floor
and
replacing
it
on
his
head
said
as
she
raised
him
up
thou
hast
adventured
and
overcome
hence
be
thou
the
lord
of
my
heart
and
affections
the
friar
gave
them
no
more
time
to
palaver
but
joined
their
hands
pronounced
them
a
married
pair
and
blessed
their
union
in
the
name
of
the
trinity
then
sir
charles
scott
kneeled
and
casting
his
eyes
gravely
toward
the
floor
said
only
these
words
will
the
lady
whom
i
serve
take
pity
on
her
humble
slave
or
shall
he
retire
from
this
presence
ashamed
and
disgraced
woman
kind
and
affectionate
woman
is
ever
more
ready
to
confer
an
obligation
on
our
sex
than
accept
of
one
lady
jane
arose
without
any
hesitation
put
the
crown
on
the
knight
head
and
with
a
most
winning
grace
raised
him
up
and
said
gallant
knight
thou
wert
born
to
conquer
my
countrymen
and
me
i
yield
my
hand
and
with
it
my
heart
the
friar
lost
no
time
in
joining
their
hands
he
judged
it
best
and
safest
to
take
women
at
their
first
words
and
short
time
was
it
till
the
two
were
pronounced
husband
and
wife
and
whom
god
hath
joined
let
no
man
dare
to
put
asunder
amen
said
the
friar
and
bestowed
on
them
an
earnest
isaac
the
curate
expatiates
largely
on
the
greatness
and
goodness
of
this
couple
how
they
extended
their
possessions
and
were
beloved
on
the
border
their
son
he
says
was
the
famous
sir
robert
of
eskdale
the
warden
of
the
marches
from
whom
the
families
of
thirlstane
harden
and
many
other
opulent
houses
are
descended
no
union
could
be
more
happy
and
besides
it
rendered
the
lady
douglas
the
happiest
of
women
and
mary
kirkmichael
the
proudest
but
to
return
to
the
scene
in
the
gallery
with
the
knights
and
their
mistresses
the
king
and
his
nobles
who
accompanied
the
gallants
into
the
apartment
of
the
ladies
knowing
nothing
of
the
choices
each
had
made
expected
great
amusement
from
compliances
and
and
at
all
events
after
so
fair
a
beginning
a
number
of
weddings
to
be
the
result
every
one
of
the
successful
knights
expected
the
same
thing
for
it
is
a
curious
fact
which
shows
the
duplicity
of
our
character
in
a
striking
light
that
when
the
champions
were
all
in
the
apartment
together
in
the
morning
some
mentioned
one
lady
as
the
flower
of
the
land
and
of
all
present
some
mentioned
another
and
so
on
but
no
one
ever
mentioned
the
names
either
of
or
sir
charles
indeed
mentioned
no
name
but
when
each
had
named
a
pretended
favourite
with
mighty
encomiums
he
only
added
i
no
say
muckle
but
there
ane
that
i
rank
aboon
a
thae
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
looked
round
to
call
the
next
champion
to
kneel
but
behold
he
was
not
there
he
called
the
next
again
he
was
gone
also
every
one
of
the
knights
had
vanished
each
thinking
slighted
by
the
preference
given
to
sir
charles
scott
but
none
knowing
that
for
his
sake
they
were
all
slighted
alike
the
noblemen
were
all
in
the
utmost
consternation
the
king
became
highly
offended
and
said
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
have
these
knights
dared
to
desert
their
colours
on
the
very
eve
of
action
this
is
not
only
an
affront
put
upon
us
but
upon
our
fair
and
noble
visitors
of
whose
honour
and
feelings
we
are
more
jealous
than
of
our
own
but
the
friar
who
was
a
man
of
peace
and
disliked
all
sort
of
offence
when
he
saw
the
king
was
displeased
took
speech
to
himself
and
his
speech
set
all
the
gallery
into
a
burst
of
laughter
he
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
with
his
book
in
hand
ready
and
eager
to
officiate
still
farther
as
a
knitter
and
binder
but
when
he
saw
the
knights
all
fled
and
the
king
offended
he
uplifted
both
of
his
hands
and
one
of
his
feet
standing
still
on
the
other
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
behold
my
occupation
is
ended
woe
is
me
for
the
children
of
my
people
for
the
spirit
of
man
is
departed
away
and
he
hath
no
strength
remaining
oh
what
shall
i
do
for
the
honour
of
my
brethren
for
lo
the
virgins
are
come
to
the
altar
and
there
is
none
to
accept
of
the
offering
the
men
of
might
are
dismissed
yea
they
are
confounded
and
fled
away
and
the
daughters
of
the
land
are
left
to
bewail
the
months
and
years
of
their
virginity
woe
is
me
for
my
hand
findeth
nothing
more
to
do
the
ladies
laughed
immoderately
at
the
cases
of
the
forlorn
and
discomfited
knights
for
they
had
witnessed
the
proceedings
and
saw
that
all
their
devotions
were
paid
to
one
object
and
as
no
lady
of
scotland
had
been
chosen
one
could
not
envy
another
so
they
tittered
and
laughed
off
the
affront
as
well
as
they
could
the
friar
got
passports
into
england
and
after
much
labour
and
pain
got
the
poet
established
in
his
father
possessions
and
acknowledged
as
the
lord
of
ravensworth
he
also
regained
for
him
his
possessions
on
the
continent
which
the
nevilles
retained
for
the
space
of
two
hundred
years
that
amiable
couple
cultivated
the
arts
of
peace
music
and
song
as
long
as
they
lived
after
these
things
the
friar
was
preferred
to
great
emoluments
in
his
old
age
and
he
spent
them
all
in
acts
of
charity
and
benevolence
from
roxburgh
the
royal
party
proceeded
to
melrose
where
they
remained
two
days
which
they
spent
partly
in
devotion
and
thanksgivings
and
partly
in
viewing
the
magnificent
scenes
in
the
neighbourhood
particularly
the
great
hill
of
eildon
so
lately
reft
asunder
and
divided
into
three
by
the
power
of
the
elemental
spirits
to
this
awful
theme
the
mind
of
the
queen
still
reverted
and
on
her
last
visit
to
these
mountains
she
passed
through
the
recent
chasms
gazing
and
trembling
at
the
effects
produced
by
that
tremendous
convulsion
of
nature
and
at
length
she
had
spoken
and
dreamed
so
much
about
it
that
she
proposed
to
go
and
visit
the
castle
of
aikwood
and
if
possible
to
get
a
sight
of
the
great
enchanter
himself
before
she
left
the
border
counties
where
she
said
she
might
never
be
again
every
one
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
the
attempt
and
the
king
got
into
a
high
passion
but
still
she
could
not
not
be
driven
from
her
purpose
as
we
return
to
the
abbey
said
she
we
will
go
by
the
ford
of
at
the
foot
of
the
deep
dell
that
you
told
me
of
where
the
devil
first
made
his
appearance
on
horseback
to
the
four
warriors
i
should
not
wonder
that
we
shall
see
him
there
again
under
some
disguise
i
would
not
wonder
that
we
should
said
sir
charles
i
have
been
told
that
he
is
sometimes
seen
there
in
the
shape
of
a
clerk
sometimes
as
a
mariner
and
sometimes
in
the
form
of
the
king
of
scotland
always
begging
your
pardon
royal
madam
there
is
no
offence
sir
charles
as
long
as
you
do
not
tell
me
that
he
appears
in
the
shape
of
a
queen
i
hope
he
has
never
yet
been
known
to
assume
the
shape
of
a
woman
he
has
enow
to
appear
for
him
in
form
which
i
ken
something
about
to
my
cost
and
which
your
royal
majesty
kens
mair
about
than
i
could
have
wished
what
does
your
majesty
account
the
greatest
peril
that
man
is
subject
to
in
this
world
oh
war
war
certainly
nineteen
out
of
twenty
of
his
perils
concentrate
in
that
or
are
derived
from
it
ye
may
be
thankfu
ye
ken
nae
mair
about
it
than
that
my
lady
queen
aince
ye
gang
near
the
castle
of
aikwood
ye
get
a
little
mair
experience
perhaps
now
ye
are
determined
on
ganging
there
the
morn
and
i
am
determined
on
accompanying
you
since
you
will
go
but
troth
i
would
be
right
wae
to
see
my
queen
turned
into
a
cow
and
a
little
deil
set
to
drive
her
or
into
a
grey
mare
and
a
witch
or
warlock
set
to
gallop
on
her
or
a
doe
or
a
hare
or
a
and
a
tichel
tikes
set
after
her
to
tear
her
a
to
tareleathers
always
begging
your
pardon
my
liege
lady
as
they
were
chatting
on
in
this
familiar
and
jocular
style
they
came
to
the
identical
little
deep
dell
at
the
meeting
of
two
rivulets
or
moorland
burns
where
the
devil
and
his
three
attendant
imps
had
appeared
to
our
warriors
on
their
way
to
melrose
and
as
dan
chisholm
was
of
the
party
the
queen
caused
him
to
be
called
up
to
describe
the
whole
scene
with
the
personal
appearance
of
the
arch
fiend
the
words
he
spoke
and
also
the
extraordinary
course
that
he
had
with
him
along
the
marble
pavement
of
the
air
all
these
matters
were
detailed
to
her
by
the
trooper
with
perfect
seriousness
and
simplicity
which
made
such
an
impression
on
the
queen
romantic
and
superstitious
mind
that
her
countenance
altered
in
every
feature
and
she
was
every
now
and
then
gazing
around
as
if
expecting
satan
personal
appearance
before
them
once
more
the
party
were
sitting
on
horseback
conversing
together
when
the
sharp
eye
of
sir
charles
well
accustomed
to
the
discernment
of
all
living
or
moving
objects
whether
by
night
or
by
day
perceived
a
miserable
looking
wight
approaching
them
by
the
very
path
on
which
the
infernal
cavalcade
had
formerly
proceeded
the
queen
was
talking
to
dan
still
pushing
her
inquiries
when
sir
charles
touched
her
gently
on
the
shoulder
and
said
hush
your
majesty
see
who
is
this
approaching
us
by
the
very
road
that
the
deils
took
it
is
a
question
who
we
have
here
ane
is
nae
sure
of
ony
shape
that
appears
in
sic
a
place
and
sic
a
time
as
this
then
there
was
such
crossing
and
telling
of
beads
and
calling
on
the
names
of
saints
took
place
with
the
queen
and
her
ladies
every
one
of
them
asking
the
same
question
in
terrified
whispers
is
it
he
think
you
is
it
he
oh
is
it
he
then
there
was
a
general
request
made
that
they
should
take
instant
flight
and
ride
home
to
the
abbey
full
speed
but
an
opposition
arose
to
this
proposal
from
a
quarter
not
expected
this
was
from
no
other
than
sir
charles
english
lady
whose
education
had
taught
her
to
despise
the
superstitions
so
prevalent
in
scotland
and
seeing
them
all
about
to
fly
from
a
poor
wretch
she
opposed
it
with
indignation
adding
that
she
would
abide
his
coming
by
herself
if
none
else
would
sir
charles
was
still
far
from
being
clear
about
these
matters
hard
experience
having
taught
him
caution
however
he
commended
his
spirit
and
drew
up
by
her
side
they
rest
marshalling
behind
them
they
awaited
in
a
body
the
coming
of
this
doubtful
guest
and
every
eye
being
fixed
on
his
motions
so
every
tongue
was
busied
in
giving
vent
to
the
spontaneous
movements
of
the
mind
it
is
a
palmer
said
one
it
is
a
warlock
said
another
it
is
the
devil
said
a
third
i
ken
him
by
his
lang
nose
aha
my
royal
and
noble
dames
cried
sir
charles
exultingly
if
it
be
nae
the
deil
it
his
man
sae
we
may
expect
some
important
message
either
frae
his
infernal
majesty
or
the
great
enchanter
for
this
is
no
other
than
his
seneschal
my
royal
liege
this
man
that
you
see
approaching
is
no
other
than
gilbert
jordan
the
late
laird
of
the
peatstackknowe
who
was
drawn
by
lot
to
supply
the
room
of
the
wretch
whom
our
gospel
friar
sent
up
through
the
clouds
in
a
convoy
of
fire
and
brimstone
whether
this
be
gibbie
or
his
ghaist
it
is
hard
to
say
but
i
ken
weel
by
the
coulter
nose
it
is
either
the
one
or
the
other
your
majesty
will
scrimply
believe
it
but
the
last
time
i
saw
that
carl
the
deil
was
hauding
him
by
the
cuff
o
the
neck
ower
the
topmost
tower
of
the
castle
of
aikwood
and
the
poor
laird
was
sprawling
like
a
paddock
in
a
gled
claws
when
fifty
fathom
frae
the
ground
there
is
nought
in
nature
i
expected
less
to
see
than
that
creature
again
in
the
land
of
the
living
yet
it
is
actually
he
himself
in
flesh
and
blood
and
that
is
all
for
he
is
worn
to
skin
and
bone
and
his
nose
is
even
longer
than
it
was
hech
laird
is
this
you
and
are
you
indeed
returned
to
the
christian
world
aince
mair
aye
troth
yardbire
it
is
a
that
to
the
fore
of
me
but
who
have
you
got
all
here
to
you
gentles
this
brings
me
in
mind
of
a
story
man
that
i
hae
heard
about
the
hunting
of
stanebires
cat
whisht
gibbie
and
gie
us
nane
o
your
auld
stories
about
cats
even
now
this
is
the
queen
of
scots
and
her
attendants
rather
tell
us
in
one
word
how
you
have
made
your
escape
from
yon
infernal
gang
in
the
castle
of
aikwood
aha
yardbire
that
is
a
tale
that
winna
tell
in
ae
word
nor
twa
neither
it
wad
take
a
winter
night
in
telling
and
it
is
the
awesomest
ane
that
ever
passed
frae
the
lips
o
man
but
i
am
ower
sair
forespent
at
this
time
to
begin
to
it
oh
no
cried
the
queen
honest
man
do
not
begin
it
at
present
it
shall
serve
for
our
evening
amusement
and
you
shall
tell
it
before
your
king
and
his
nobles
after
you
have
had
such
refreshment
as
you
stand
in
need
of
she
then
caused
one
of
her
squires
to
alight
and
mounting
the
wearied
and
exhausted
laird
on
his
horse
they
rode
off
to
melrose
where
after
a
plentiful
meal
the
laird
was
brought
into
the
apartment
where
the
king
the
queen
the
abbot
with
the
nobles
and
ladies
of
the
court
were
all
assembled
and
then
at
the
royal
request
he
related
to
them
the
following
narrative
chapter
xii
commissions
and
black
bills
he
had
and
a
the
land
went
mad
the
like
was
never
seen
joe
to
dance
and
caper
in
the
air
and
there
an
end
of
him
joe
jacobite
weel
ye
see
my
masters
and
mistresses
this
is
what
i
never
expected
to
see
there
is
something
sae
grand
in
being
in
the
presence
of
a
king
and
queen
and
their
courtiers
that
it
brings
me
in
mind
of
the
devil
and
his
agents
that
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
for
a
month
bygane
but
there
is
some
wee
difference
in
masters
for
that
for
in
my
late
service
if
i
had
been
brought
in
to
entertain
them
in
an
instant
they
would
have
had
me
transformed
into
some
paltry
animal
and
then
amused
themselves
by
tormenting
that
animal
to
death
by
dissecting
it
while
living
but
the
queerest
thing
of
all
was
this
there
was
aye
a
spark
of
life
that
they
could
not
destroy
which
for
all
their
cruelties
remained
active
and
intelligent
as
before
and
the
moment
they
put
that
spark
of
life
out
of
one
animal
they
popped
it
into
another
and
there
was
i
obliged
to
undergo
the
same
dismemberment
and
pain
once
more
and
so
on
for
ever
the
inflicting
of
torment
was
their
chief
delight
and
of
that
delight
there
was
no
satiety
it
seemed
still
to
increase
by
gratification
on
the
very
first
day
that
i
entered
on
my
probation
they
had
a
feast
as
my
comrades
know
and
as
i
also
have
good
reason
to
know
for
on
that
day
i
suffered
death
nine
times
and
yet
i
was
gibbie
jordan
again
before
night
they
first
turned
me
into
a
cock
and
after
the
three
pages
had
chased
me
round
the
castle
and
thrown
stones
at
me
till
i
was
hanging
out
my
tongue
and
could
not
cackle
another
lilt
they
seized
me
took
me
into
the
scullery
and
drew
my
neck
ere
ever
i
was
aware
they
had
me
transformed
into
a
huge
lubberly
calf
while
one
of
the
hellish
pages
was
dragging
me
by
the
neck
with
a
prickly
rope
made
of
hurcheon
hides
and
the
two
others
were
belabouring
my
rumple
with
cudgels
i
suspected
their
intentions
and
being
still
terrified
for
death
and
inclining
rather
to
suffer
any
thing
i
drew
back
shook
my
head
and
bellowed
at
them
while
they
still
redoubled
their
blows
on
my
carcase
and
cursed
me
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
they
dragged
me
gasping
into
the
kept
the
knife
an
excruciating
long
time
at
my
throat
and
then
after
piercing
the
jugular
vein
they
laughed
immoderately
to
see
me
running
about
bleeding
to
death
with
my
glazed
stupid
eyes
and
when
through
faintness
i
began
to
flounder
and
grovel
on
the
floor
they
laughed
amain
threshed
me
to
make
me
plunge
a
little
more
and
when
i
could
do
nothing
farther
than
give
a
faint
baa
they
thought
that
the
best
sport
of
all
and
mimicked
me
i
had
scarcely
ceased
baaing
as
a
calf
when
i
found
myself
a
beautiful
cappercailzie
winging
the
winter
cloud
and
three
devils
of
falcons
after
me
thinks
i
to
myself
i
do
not
give
you
the
glaiks
now
my
hellish
masters
may
i
never
wap
a
wing
again
by
all
the
powers
of
swiftness
but
i
shall
try
for
once
if
the
feathers
shall
not
carry
the
flesh
away
sanct
martha
as
i
did
scour
the
rimy
firmament
i
took
the
wind
in
my
tail
but
i
went
with
such
amazing
velocity
that
i
left
it
behind
me
and
as
i
clove
it
it
seemed
to
return
in
my
face
i
reached
the
shoulder
of
a
lofty
mountain
and
then
i
laid
back
my
wings
and
bolted
through
the
air
like
a
flash
of
lightning
ho
messrs
hawks
where
are
you
now
thought
i
to
myself
good
lord
ere
ever
i
was
aware
there
was
ane
o
them
gave
me
a
nab
on
the
crown
that
dovered
me
and
gart
me
tumble
down
frae
the
shelves
of
the
clouds
and
lighting
with
a
dunt
on
the
ground
i
had
nae
shift
but
to
stap
my
head
in
a
heather
bush
and
let
them
pelt
at
me
till
i
got
some
breath
again
then
i
made
for
a
cottage
thinking
the
inmates
could
not
but
pity
my
condition
and
drive
the
hawks
away
from
me
i
took
cover
among
their
cabbage
in
the
sight
of
both
man
and
wife
but
instead
of
pitying
me
the
one
came
with
an
old
spear
and
the
other
with
the
tongs
to
finish
my
existence
and
always
when
the
falcons
came
down
on
me
with
their
talons
the
two
cried
out
weel
done
little
hawkie
yether
him
up
puik
him
weel
i
was
forced
to
take
wing
again
till
at
length
through
fatigue
and
want
of
feathers
i
dropt
close
to
the
castle
whence
i
had
set
out
and
the
three
falcons
closing
with
me
first
picked
out
my
eyes
and
then
my
brains
i
was
stabbed
as
a
salmon
hunted
as
a
felled
as
a
bull
and
had
my
head
chopped
off
for
a
drake
the
dinner
was
made
up
of
me
i
supplied
every
dish
and
then
was
forced
to
cook
them
all
afterward
it
was
no
wonder
that
i
could
not
partake
of
the
fragments
of
the
meal
from
the
moment
that
the
christian
warriors
were
all
dismissed
with
disgrace
from
the
castle
the
devil
became
contumacious
with
the
master
and
assayed
to
carry
matters
with
a
very
high
hand
but
he
had
to
do
with
one
that
would
not
succumb
no
not
in
the
smallest
point
but
who
opposed
him
with
a
degree
of
virulence
of
which
even
the
master
fiend
seemed
scarcely
capable
it
was
a
scene
of
constant
contention
and
rage
and
the
little
subordinate
demons
did
not
always
know
which
to
obey
it
was
if
it
please
your
majesties
a
scene
acted
in
terrible
magnificence
of
which
i
have
seen
several
poor
and
abortive
emblems
among
mortal
men
and
henceforth
i
shall
aways
believe
and
feel
when
i
see
a
family
or
society
constantly
involved
in
disputes
wranglings
and
angry
emotions
that
they
are
children
of
the
wicked
one
and
moved
by
the
spirit
of
discord
that
bane
of
the
human
race
the
worthy
gentleman
hath
said
well
said
the
abbot
it
is
a
moral
truth
that
can
never
be
too
deeply
impressed
that
and
love
only
lead
to
they
are
emanations
from
above
and
the
contrary
passions
from
beneath
all
the
fierce
and
fiery
passions
of
the
soul
are
the
offspring
of
hell
fire
but
a
truce
with
preaching
honest
friend
go
on
with
your
strange
relation
and
acquaint
us
in
what
manner
his
infernal
majesty
and
the
king
of
mortal
magicians
spent
their
time
in
constant
discord
and
jarring
the
devil
challenged
the
master
with
impotency
in
entertaining
a
poor
crazy
monk
and
submitting
to
be
protected
and
even
cowed
by
him
at
which
the
master
took
high
offence
and
retorted
in
the
bitterest
terms
while
the
other
always
hinted
that
he
would
make
him
repent
his
intercourse
with
that
preposterous
and
presumptive
fool
so
he
termed
our
own
worthy
friar
and
head
chaplain
in
one
thing
only
they
agreed
and
that
was
in
abusing
the
witches
never
were
there
poor
deluded
creatures
guided
in
such
a
way
as
they
the
devil
says
to
the
master
one
day
in
my
hearing
brother
michael
says
he
i
have
an
act
of
justice
to
perform
to
all
our
true
and
trusty
female
lieges
in
this
quarter
i
gave
them
my
princely
word
of
honour
that
on
their
yielding
themselves
up
souls
and
bodies
to
me
and
to
my
service
they
should
all
be
married
and
all
to
young
and
goodly
husbands
too
that
having
been
the
principal
and
almost
the
only
boon
the
good
consistent
creatures
required
of
me
for
the
sacrifice
they
made
they
must
not
be
disappointed
the
master
acquiesced
but
at
the
same
time
remarked
with
what
i
judged
unreasonable
chagrin
that
when
he
was
keeping
his
word
so
punctually
it
betokened
nothing
good
for
those
to
whom
he
kept
it
well
we
had
a
witch
wedding
every
night
for
nine
nights
running
but
such
extreme
of
wickedness
is
past
all
human
comprehension
beyond
the
possibility
of
description
the
marriage
ceremony
itself
always
performed
by
a
demon
in
the
habit
of
a
friar
was
a
piece
of
the
most
horrid
blasphemy
ever
conceived
and
every
night
one
of
the
witches
was
married
to
the
devil
in
disguise
sometimes
the
bridegroom
made
his
appearance
as
a
gay
cavalier
sometimes
as
a
country
squire
a
foreign
merchant
a
minstrel
and
a
the
old
wretch
of
a
bride
was
all
painted
by
some
devilish
cantrip
and
bedecked
with
false
jewels
and
though
she
seemed
always
aware
of
the
deceit
in
a
certain
degree
from
former
experiences
yet
it
was
wonderful
with
what
avidity
each
of
the
old
creatures
clung
to
her
enamoured
and
goodly
husband
how
they
mumped
and
minced
in
their
talking
and
ogled
with
their
old
grey
ropy
eyes
and
then
how
they
danced
gracious
me
how
they
flung
and
danced
among
the
deils
and
the
warlocks
and
capered
and
snapped
their
fingers
giving
their
partners
often
a
jerk
on
the
nose
or
the
temple
as
they
passed
and
repassed
in
the
reel
as
quick
as
green
clocks
on
a
pool
then
the
bedding
of
the
brides
these
surpassed
all
description
and
as
they
had
me
fairly
in
thrall
i
was
suffered
to
witness
every
thing
the
first
witch
bride
was
led
out
at
the
back
door
of
the
castle
with
much
state
and
ceremony
into
a
place
that
had
been
a
bowling
green
and
in
which
there
was
nothing
else
save
a
bowling
green
yet
to
my
amazement
there
stood
a
bower
of
the
most
superb
magnificence
and
there
in
a
chamber
hung
with
gorgeous
tapestry
that
glittered
all
with
gold
and
rubies
the
loving
couple
retired
to
their
repose
and
to
all
the
delights
and
joys
of
so
happy
an
union
then
wishing
them
the
greatest
conjugal
felicity
all
the
gallants
returned
to
the
castle
but
i
being
curious
to
see
what
would
be
the
end
of
this
grand
pavilion
in
the
which
i
knew
must
be
merely
a
delusion
avision
a
shadow
of
something
that
had
no
stability
of
existence
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
castle
and
from
a
sat
and
watched
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
this
phenomenon
i
waited
a
good
long
while
and
began
to
think
all
was
real
and
that
the
splendid
witch
had
met
with
a
happy
fortune
for
i
knew
them
too
well
to
be
all
witches
from
former
happy
experience
but
at
length
the
lusty
bridegroom
as
i
supposed
began
to
weary
of
his
mate
for
i
saw
the
form
of
the
bower
beginning
to
change
and
fall
flat
on
the
top
and
its
hue
also
became
of
a
lurid
fiery
colour
i
can
not
tell
your
majesties
what
sort
of
sensations
i
felt
when
i
saw
the
wedded
couple
sinking
gradually
down
through
a
bed
of
red
burning
fire
and
the
poor
old
beldame
writhing
to
death
in
the
arms
of
a
huge
and
terrible
monster
that
squeezed
her
in
its
embraces
and
hugged
her
and
caressed
her
till
the
spark
of
wretched
life
was
wholly
extinguished
i
saw
distinctly
by
the
light
of
the
flame
that
surrounded
them
and
marked
every
twist
of
the
features
and
every
quiver
of
the
convulsed
limbs
yet
these
were
not
more
impressive
than
the
joy
of
the
exulting
fiend
who
continued
to
caress
and
kiss
his
agonized
mate
to
the
last
and
called
her
his
love
and
his
darling
and
his
heart
delight
at
length
the
distortions
of
the
human
countenance
reached
their
acme
the
shrivelled
bosom
forgot
to
throb
and
with
the
expiry
of
the
mortal
spark
the
lurid
flame
that
burnt
around
them
also
went
out
and
all
was
darkness
there
was
no
bower
no
chamber
no
bridal
bed
but
a
cold
winter
soil
and
i
thought
that
through
the
gloom
i
perceived
the
couple
still
lying
on
it
as
i
could
get
no
rest
all
that
night
for
thinking
of
the
terrible
scene
i
had
witnessed
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
next
morning
i
went
out
to
the
but
found
nothing
there
save
the
strangled
body
of
the
wretched
woman
a
dismal
and
humbling
sight
squeezed
almost
to
a
jelly
and
every
bone
broken
as
if
it
had
been
smashed
on
an
anvil
being
curious
to
examine
her
robes
in
which
she
appeared
with
such
splendour
the
evening
before
and
her
jewels
part
of
which
i
had
seen
her
lay
carefully
aside
i
took
every
thing
up
as
it
lay
her
robes
were
a
small
heap
of
the
most
wretched
rags
imaginable
her
pearl
necklace
was
a
string
of
dead
beetles
and
her
diamond
rings
pieces
of
thread
on
which
were
fastened
small
knots
of
clay
and
every
thing
else
proportionally
mean
while
i
was
standing
considering
this
vile
degradation
that
had
taken
place
i
heard
a
voice
at
a
little
distance
that
called
to
me
and
said
gibbie
jordan
gibbie
jordan
why
standest
thou
in
amazement
at
a
true
emblem
of
all
worldly
grandeur
it
is
all
equally
unreal
and
unsubstantial
as
that
on
which
thou
lookest
and
to
that
it
must
all
come
at
last
friend
thought
i
canna
surely
be
a
sae
perfectly
unreal
as
this
else
what
does
it
signify
but
a
that
i
could
look
and
glime
about
i
could
never
discover
the
speaker
that
said
this
and
when
i
thought
seriously
of
the
matter
i
found
that
it
comes
a
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
honest
friend
thou
hast
again
illustrated
a
momentous
moral
truth
said
the
abbot
and
i
thank
thee
for
it
thou
hast
the
art
in
thy
simplicity
of
extracting
more
good
out
of
real
evil
than
any
expounder
of
divine
truths
throughout
the
land
thou
art
both
a
moral
and
a
natural
philosopher
and
i
intend
conferring
on
thee
some
benefice
under
the
church
that
thy
talents
may
no
longer
remain
locked
up
in
a
helmet
prithee
go
on
with
thy
extraordinary
narrative
but
these
witch
weddings
are
too
horrible
for
mortal
ears
then
you
may
consider
my
lord
abbot
what
they
were
for
mortal
eyes
especially
such
a
run
of
them
which
were
every
night
varied
in
their
horrors
and
terminated
in
something
perfectly
distinct
from
all
those
preceding
on
the
second
night
the
bridegroom
was
a
foreign
merchant
a
man
of
bustle
and
punctuality
who
said
he
could
not
remain
late
with
his
kind
convivial
friends
and
was
under
the
necessity
of
carrying
his
bride
off
at
an
early
hour
having
business
of
importance
to
transact
on
the
morrow
it
was
a
speculation
he
said
on
which
he
calculated
making
a
good
profit
and
a
man
who
was
coming
in
to
have
a
wife
and
in
all
probability
a
small
family
to
maintain
required
to
look
after
and
attend
to
these
matters
the
witch
caressed
him
in
ecstacy
when
he
made
this
speech
and
proffered
to
go
with
him
as
soon
as
he
chose
she
saluted
her
cronies
and
bade
them
farewell
and
although
there
is
no
love
among
those
sort
of
people
yet
there
was
still
so
much
of
human
nature
remaining
that
there
seemed
to
subsist
a
degree
of
regret
that
they
should
never
meet
again
my
own
heart
was
even
sore
for
the
wretched
beldame
for
i
had
witnessed
a
scene
the
preceding
night
which
had
been
withheld
from
her
view
and
those
of
the
other
brides
that
were
to
be
and
i
knew
that
a
fate
somewhat
similar
awaited
them
all
they
mounted
this
one
behind
the
spruce
merchant
on
a
tall
gallant
charger
whose
eyes
gleamed
like
lightning
and
away
they
set
over
the
leas
of
carterhaugh
at
a
light
gallop
but
at
every
bound
the
swiftness
of
the
steed
increased
till
it
was
quickly
beyond
the
speed
of
the
eagle
the
witch
held
like
grim
death
and
would
fain
have
expostulated
with
the
bridegroom
on
the
madness
of
risking
their
necks
for
a
little
per
centage
but
her
velocity
was
such
that
she
could
make
no
farther
speech
of
it
than
just
a
squeak
now
and
then
like
a
shot
hare
the
reckless
merchant
flew
on
still
increasing
his
rapidity
until
he
came
to
the
very
highest
rock
of
the
harehead
linn
the
witch
knew
of
the
dreadful
chasm
that
was
before
them
and
weening
that
her
husband
did
not
know
she
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
but
the
void
was
only
thirty
yards
across
and
a
hundred
deep
so
the
fearless
merchant
meaning
to
take
it
at
one
leap
made
his
charger
bound
from
the
top
of
the
precipice
the
infernal
courser
cleared
the
linn
but
the
witch
head
failing
she
toppled
off
about
the
middle
space
there
were
two
fishermen
spearing
salmon
in
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
who
saw
the
phenomenon
pass
over
their
heads
and
the
wife
lose
her
hold
and
fall
off
they
heard
her
likewise
saying
as
she
came
adown
the
air
aih
what
a
fa
i
will
get
and
as
she
said
so
it
fell
out
for
she
alighted
on
the
rocks
a
short
space
from
the
place
where
they
stood
and
was
literally
dashed
in
pieces
but
the
steed
ran
away
with
the
merchant
over
hill
and
dale
like
a
thunderbolt
and
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
ever
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
what
had
befallen
the
bride
this
continuation
of
horrors
still
depriving
me
of
rest
i
went
into
the
linn
the
next
morning
to
look
after
the
corpse
but
the
three
pages
prig
prim
and
pricker
were
engaged
with
it
cutting
it
trimly
up
and
hanging
it
on
the
trees
of
the
linn
to
be
frozen
so
that
they
might
thereby
be
enabled
to
preserve
it
for
some
grand
experiment
in
the
same
manner
did
they
serve
the
remains
of
all
the
brides
none
of
them
ever
being
buried
but
there
was
one
taken
away
bodily
i
shall
now
in
conformity
with
your
reverence
hint
desist
from
the
description
of
any
more
of
these
weddings
and
proceed
to
the
adventure
by
which
i
attained
my
liberty
i
had
often
attempted
this
both
by
night
and
by
day
but
these
imps
seemed
to
possess
a
sort
of
prescience
for
in
all
my
attempts
i
was
seized
and
maltreated
so
grossly
that
i
gave
up
all
hopes
of
escape
otherwise
than
by
some
upbreaking
of
the
warlock
establishment
and
of
all
such
incidents
i
had
resolved
to
avail
myself
and
you
all
see
that
at
last
i
have
succeeded
which
happened
on
this
wise
still
as
christmas
tide
drew
on
the
wranglings
between
my
two
chief
masters
the
devil
and
the
warlock
grew
more
and
more
fierce
and
as
i
heard
they
were
obliged
to
sever
before
that
time
i
both
hoped
and
dreaded
some
terrible
convulsion
the
fiend
for
several
successive
days
was
always
hinting
to
the
master
that
it
now
behoved
the
latter
to
deliver
him
up
the
black
book
and
the
divining
rod
and
he
tried
to
cajole
him
out
of
them
by
fair
speeches
and
boundless
promises
but
with
these
requests
the
master
testified
no
disposition
to
comply
and
the
promises
he
utterly
disregarded
bidding
him
bestow
his
promises
on
those
who
did
not
know
him
at
length
the
fiend
fairly
told
him
that
he
must
and
would
have
the
possession
of
these
invaluable
treasures
which
ought
never
to
have
been
put
into
the
hands
of
mortal
man
and
that
now
he
would
have
them
if
he
should
tear
his
heart
from
his
bosom
to
attain
the
boon
i
weened
that
matters
were
come
to
that
pass
now
that
the
master
would
be
obliged
to
yield
and
that
all
this
show
of
resistance
was
only
the
ebullition
of
a
proud
and
indignant
spirit
struggling
against
the
yoke
under
which
it
knew
it
was
obliged
to
bow
like
a
horse
that
champs
the
bit
to
the
sway
of
which
it
knows
too
well
it
must
submit
in
all
this
however
i
had
reckoned
before
mine
host
and
knew
not
the
resources
of
the
great
magician
beneath
the
influence
of
the
cross
i
found
him
a
child
a
novice
a
nonentity
unresolved
and
inconsistent
in
his
actions
but
amongst
the
beings
with
whom
he
associated
i
found
him
a
superior
intelligence
a
spirit
formed
to
controul
the
mightiest
energies
and
not
brooking
submission
to
any
power
unless
by
compulsion
to
my
utter
astonishment
he
not
only
gave
the
absolute
refusal
but
haughty
defiance
and
then
it
was
apparent
that
except
from
necessity
all
forbearance
was
at
an
end
preposterous
madman
dost
thou
know
whom
thou
beardest
said
the
fiend
gnashing
his
teeth
with
rage
and
thirst
of
vengeance
knowest
thou
with
whom
thou
art
contending
thou
maniac
and
that
i
can
wring
thy
soul
out
of
thy
body
consigning
the
one
to
the
dunghill
and
the
other
to
elemental
slavery
at
my
will
and
pleasure
i
defy
thee
said
the
master
do
thy
worst
he
that
imparts
a
moiety
of
his
power
to
another
must
abide
by
the
consequences
do
i
not
know
with
whom
i
am
contending
yes
i
know
thee
and
thou
art
so
well
aware
that
i
do
that
at
this
moment
thou
tremblest
beneath
my
rod
i
know
thee
for
a
liar
a
deceiver
a
backbiter
and
a
spirit
of
insatiable
malevolence
who
can
lay
one
of
these
charges
to
my
name
were
i
immortal
as
thou
art
how
i
would
hurl
thee
from
thy
usurped
and
tyrannic
sway
over
the
mighty
energies
of
nature
were
i
freed
of
the
incumbrances
of
mortality
of
blood
that
may
be
let
out
by
a
bodkin
bones
that
may
be
broken
by
the
tip
of
an
and
breath
that
may
be
stopped
by
the
twang
of
a
of
vitals
subjected
to
be
torn
by
disease
preyed
on
by
hunger
thirst
and
a
thousand
casualties
beside
yes
were
i
rid
of
these
congregated
impediments
as
i
shall
soon
be
i
would
thrust
thee
down
into
that
subordinate
sphere
of
action
to
which
only
thy
perverse
nature
is
fitted
this
black
book
and
this
are
mine
they
were
consigned
to
my
hands
by
thyself
and
the
four
viceroys
of
the
elements
and
part
with
them
shall
i
never
either
in
life
or
in
death
and
while
i
possess
them
i
am
thy
superior
begone
and
let
me
hear
no
more
of
thy
brawling
at
this
time
lest
i
humble
thee
and
trample
on
thee
before
thy
day
of
power
be
expired
this
the
master
pronounced
in
loud
and
furious
accents
and
as
he
finished
he
struck
the
devil
across
the
gorge
with
his
golden
rod
the
blow
made
him
spring
aloof
and
tumble
into
the
air
it
had
such
powerful
effect
on
his
frame
and
when
he
stood
again
on
his
feet
he
roared
with
rage
and
indignation
in
a
voice
that
resembled
thunder
the
master
had
the
black
book
belted
to
his
bosom
with
bands
of
steel
that
were
hammered
in
the
forge
of
hell
and
laying
his
left
hand
upon
that
and
brandishing
his
in
his
right
he
dared
the
fiend
to
the
combat
the
latter
approached
and
poured
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
such
a
stream
of
liquid
flame
on
the
magician
that
it
appeared
like
a
fiery
rainbow
between
them
this
greatly
incommoded
the
master
and
made
him
skip
like
a
mountebank
but
it
was
soon
exhausted
and
then
the
fiend
threw
trees
and
rocks
at
him
some
of
the
latter
of
the
weight
of
five
tons
all
these
the
master
eschewed
and
though
he
sought
no
other
weapons
but
his
rod
he
brake
in
upon
his
antagonist
and
chaced
him
from
the
field
then
the
war
of
words
again
commenced
which
increased
to
a
tempest
of
threatening
wrath
and
defiance
the
boasted
of
his
legions
and
of
their
irresistible
power
and
threatened
to
bring
them
all
to
the
contest
and
annihilate
the
master
and
his
adherents
root
and
branch
i
have
already
said
that
i
fear
neither
them
nor
thee
said
the
master
what
though
thou
hast
the
sovereignty
over
the
element
of
fire
and
all
the
fierce
and
indurated
spirits
that
sojourn
and
ply
in
the
sultry
regions
of
flame
as
also
of
the
grovelling
spirits
of
the
mould
have
not
i
at
my
command
those
of
the
air
and
the
water
i
can
muster
against
thee
the
storm
the
whirlwind
and
the
raging
tempest
the
overwhelming
wave
and
the
descending
torrent
these
shall
extinguish
thy
meteor
hosts
and
sweep
thy
from
the
face
of
the
earth
i
am
in
the
midst
of
my
elements
here
thou
art
out
of
thine
and
that
thou
shalt
feel
when
thou
bringest
it
to
trial
thus
parted
these
two
associates
but
now
jealous
and
inexorable
foes
a
good
lesson
to
all
those
who
form
combinations
inimical
to
the
laws
or
authority
of
the
land
in
which
they
reside
like
those
such
are
likewise
conspirators
against
rightful
sovereignty
although
on
a
smaller
scale
and
like
those
whom
they
imitate
and
by
whom
they
are
moved
their
counsels
will
always
be
turned
either
to
foolishness
or
against
themselves
the
sphere
that
this
man
hath
filled
in
society
said
the
abbot
is
far
below
that
in
which
he
ought
to
have
moved
if
his
narrative
is
true
which
i
can
hardly
believe
he
turns
it
to
most
excellent
uses
and
if
it
is
an
apologue
it
is
one
well
conceived
for
the
purposes
of
instruction
verily
this
gentleman
hath
never
moved
in
his
proper
sphere
i
think
it
is
not
very
unlikely
that
your
reverence
says
said
sir
ringan
for
he
made
no
great
figure
in
it
tho
i
had
always
a
partiality
for
him
i
had
no
great
faith
in
his
valour
he
would
rather
have
cut
down
a
warrior
behind
his
back
than
before
his
face
any
time
he
has
made
mare
quake
this
night
wi
his
tale
than
ever
he
did
wi
his
weapon
i
entreat
ye
to
get
on
laird
and
let
us
hear
how
they
made
up
matters
made
up
matters
does
my
chief
say
that
was
a
term
no
more
mentioned
between
them
they
separated
but
to
raise
their
different
forces
and
meet
again
with
more
fury
and
effect
the
master
spoke
to
his
three
pages
and
asked
if
they
were
resolved
to
stand
firm
to
his
interest
they
answered
that
they
would
till
the
term
of
their
bondage
expired
then
am
i
doubly
armed
said
the
master
exultingly
and
i
will
show
your
tyrant
that
i
can
quell
his
utmost
rage
speed
thee
my
trusty
and
nimble
spirits
speed
to
the
western
and
northern
spheres
and
rouse
the
slumbering
angels
of
the
winds
and
the
waters
tell
them
to
muster
their
array
and
bear
hitherward
to
rear
the
broad
billows
of
the
atlantic
up
against
the
breast
of
heaven
and
to
make
a
bellows
of
every
cloud
to
gather
the
winds
up
behind
them
then
bring
down
the
irresistible
spirits
of
the
frozen
north
in
ambush
and
who
shall
stand
against
their
fury
how
soon
will
you
execute
your
commissions
master
i
ring
the
surface
of
the
ocean
from
the
line
to
the
first
field
of
pickled
ice
before
the
is
half
run
master
i
look
south
on
the
polar
star
call
every
whale
and
spirit
by
his
name
and
return
to
you
before
the
can
boomb
his
vesper
and
i
to
the
moon
and
the
stars
aboon
and
rack
my
invention
for
the
coming
contention
and
the
wind
and
the
weet
and
the
snow
and
the
sleet
i
gather
and
gather
and
drive
them
on
hither
with
that
the
three
imps
departed
on
their
several
missions
but
not
before
they
had
seized
me
and
bound
me
to
a
ring
on
a
turret
of
the
castle
the
master
retired
into
his
apartment
for
some
time
but
soon
came
up
to
the
level
space
on
the
top
of
the
castle
our
old
birth
and
strode
about
in
the
most
violent
agitation
but
appearing
rather
to
be
moved
by
anger
and
impatience
than
by
dread
at
length
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
how
now
droich
what
thinkest
thou
of
all
this
i
said
nothing
for
i
durst
not
answer
a
word
dost
thou
think
continued
he
that
there
exists
another
being
either
mortal
or
immortal
like
me
thy
master
i
still
durst
not
answer
a
word
for
if
i
had
said
it
would
have
been
blasphemy
and
if
i
had
said
it
would
have
provoked
him
to
do
me
a
mischief
so
i
looked
at
my
bonds
and
held
my
peace
thou
darest
not
say
there
is
continued
he
but
i
know
what
thou
thinkest
sit
thou
there
in
peace
till
this
great
trial
of
power
be
over
and
if
thou
darest
for
thy
life
invoke
another
name
than
mine
thou
shalt
never
stir
from
that
spot
dead
or
alive
but
if
thou
takest
heed
to
this
injunction
and
cease
from
all
petitions
to
or
mention
of
a
name
which
thou
mayest
judge
superior
to
mine
then
shalt
thou
be
set
at
liberty
to
join
thy
friends
i
determined
to
attend
to
this
but
he
waited
not
for
my
answer
but
strode
away
looking
now
and
then
on
the
book
of
destiny
and
at
the
western
heaven
alternately
at
length
he
exclaimed
yonder
they
come
yonder
they
rise
in
grand
battalia
noble
and
potent
spirits
how
speedily
have
you
executed
your
commission
yonder
comes
the
muster
of
my
array
and
who
shall
stand
against
them
i
looked
towards
the
west
when
i
heard
him
talking
in
such
ecstacies
but
could
see
nothing
save
a
phalanx
of
towering
clouds
rolling
up
in
wreaths
from
the
dun
horizon
i
had
seen
the
same
scene
a
hundred
times
and
could
hardly
help
smiling
at
his
enthusiasm
especially
when
he
went
over
a
long
of
the
names
of
spirits
and
monsters
whom
he
saw
approaching
in
the
cloud
is
a
sign
that
warlocks
have
clear
een
thinks
i
quietly
i
see
nothing
but
a
range
of
rolling
and
restless
clouds
however
he
was
so
overjoyed
with
the
sight
of
this
visionary
array
that
having
no
other
to
communicate
with
he
came
rapidly
up
to
me
and
said
tell
me
droich
didst
thou
ever
witness
any
thing
so
truly
grand
as
the
approach
of
this
host
of
mine
you
must
first
lend
me
the
use
of
your
eyes
that
i
may
see
them
said
i
for
on
my
word
i
see
nothing
save
two
or
three
files
of
castled
clouds
which
i
have
seen
an
hundred
times
with
that
he
lent
me
a
blow
with
his
rod
and
said
though
not
apparently
in
wrath
thou
hast
no
brighter
eyes
and
no
brighter
conceptions
than
a
hedgehog
but
art
a
mere
clod
of
the
valley
a
worm
if
i
knew
of
aught
lower
to
liken
thee
to
i
would
do
it
dost
thou
see
nothing
like
fleets
and
armies
approaching
yonder
dost
thou
not
see
an
hundred
and
seven
of
the
ships
of
the
ocean
above
coming
full
sail
with
colours
flying
and
canvas
spread
seest
thou
not
also
to
the
south
of
these
two
files
of
behemoths
with
ten
thousand
beside
i
looked
again
and
though
i
was
sensible
it
must
be
a
delusion
brought
on
by
by
the
stroke
of
his
powerful
rod
yet
i
did
see
the
appearance
of
a
glorious
fleet
of
ships
coming
bounding
along
the
surface
of
the
firmament
of
air
while
every
mainsail
was
bosomed
out
like
the
side
of
a
highland
mountain
i
saw
besides
whole
columns
of
what
i
supposed
to
be
crocodiles
sharks
kelpies
and
with
a
thousand
monsters
never
dreamed
of
by
human
being
the
master
marked
my
astonishment
and
exulted
still
the
more
and
then
he
desired
me
to
turn
round
and
look
toward
the
north
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
but
on
being
touched
again
with
the
i
shall
never
forget
such
a
sight
as
opened
gradually
to
my
view
the
whole
northern
hemisphere
from
the
eastern
to
the
western
horizon
was
covered
with
marshalled
hosts
of
the
shades
of
gigantic
warriors
they
were
all
mailed
in
white
armour
as
if
it
had
been
sprinkled
with
and
their
beards
which
had
the
appearance
of
icicles
hung
down
swinging
in
the
wind
like
so
many
inverted
forests
stripped
of
their
foliage
and
bark
and
encrusted
with
ice
they
were
all
mounted
on
the
ghosts
of
crackens
whales
and
walruses
and
for
bows
and
quivers
each
had
a
blown
bladder
on
his
bade
as
large
as
the
hill
of
my
heart
quaked
at
the
view
of
these
tremendous
polar
spirits
and
i
said
great
and
magnificent
master
are
yon
terrible
chaps
all
coming
hither
certes
they
are
said
he
why
dost
thou
ask
after
having
heard
my
mandate
sent
forth
because
said
i
if
yon
bearded
spirits
be
a
coming
here
i
wish
i
were
somewhere
else
for
the
like
of
yon
was
never
beheld
by
man
if
your
opponents
dare
face
you
they
have
a
spirit
beyond
what
i
can
conceive
they
will
be
here
and
that
instantly
said
he
and
lo
yonder
they
come
i
will
go
down
and
meet
them
on
the
open
field
but
in
the
meantime
i
will
loose
you
with
my
own
hands
for
who
knows
what
may
be
the
issue
of
this
day
remain
where
thou
art
for
here
thou
shalt
be
safe
but
no
where
else
i
looked
and
as
far
as
my
eyes
could
discern
i
saw
as
it
were
a
thousand
thousand
sparks
of
fire
rising
from
the
east
that
came
in
a
straight
line
toward
me
and
with
great
velocity
as
they
came
nearer
i
perceived
that
they
were
all
fiery
serpents
with
faces
like
men
and
small
flaming
spears
issuing
from
their
mouths
which
they
held
between
their
teeth
or
drew
in
as
they
listed
these
were
led
on
to
the
combat
by
the
himself
who
came
at
their
head
in
the
form
of
a
huge
fiery
dragon
with
his
iron
crown
on
his
head
and
wings
springing
from
his
shoulders
behind
that
reached
as
high
as
the
hill
of
blackandro
god
guide
us
thinks
i
to
mysel
has
an
awsome
adversary
to
contend
with
the
day
he
was
nothing
daunted
however
but
went
boldly
down
the
valley
where
he
was
met
by
hosts
of
crawling
monsters
such
as
snakes
lizards
and
a
thousand
others
these
i
took
to
be
the
spirits
of
the
element
of
earth
but
they
were
lubbards
in
a
field
of
battle
for
at
a
brandish
of
the
magical
rod
they
ran
off
wagging
their
tails
in
such
a
vengeance
of
a
hurry
that
they
overturned
one
another
the
van
of
michael
western
array
had
by
this
time
gained
the
middle
sky
and
hung
boiling
and
wheeling
like
a
troubled
ocean
straight
above
his
head
and
above
mine
its
colour
was
as
dark
as
pitch
but
there
was
now
and
then
a
shade
of
a
dead
white
colour
rolled
out
and
as
suddenly
again
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
i
never
saw
ought
so
awfully
sublime
it
had
now
descended
so
low
that
it
hid
the
polar
giants
entirely
from
my
view
and
the
master
kept
waving
his
rod
towards
it
and
clapping
his
left
hand
always
on
the
black
book
till
at
length
with
the
motion
of
a
whirlpool
the
cloud
came
and
settled
all
round
him
the
fiend
and
his
firebrands
perceiving
this
darted
with
the
utmost
fury
into
the
middle
of
it
and
the
most
tremendous
crash
of
thunder
ensued
that
ever
shook
heaven
and
earth
my
eyes
were
dazzled
so
that
i
could
not
see
ought
distinctly
but
i
perceived
these
flaming
meteors
glancing
and
quivering
round
the
verges
of
the
darkness
and
ever
and
anon
darting
again
into
it
seven
of
these
peals
of
thunder
succeeded
one
another
and
then
i
saw
the
spirits
of
flame
would
overcome
for
the
darkness
began
to
scatter
and
i
saw
the
master
hard
bested
defending
himself
with
his
rod
against
a
multitude
he
then
cried
with
a
loud
voice
and
waved
his
rod
toward
the
north
and
that
moment
the
giant
warriors
of
the
polar
regions
loosed
all
their
quivers
at
once
and
with
such
effect
that
they
tossed
the
opposing
legions
before
them
like
chaff
the
hailstones
the
snow
and
the
sleet
poured
upon
them
thicker
and
faster
and
the
wind
roared
louder
than
their
thunders
had
done
before
there
was
no
more
power
in
their
foes
to
stand
before
them
they
were
scattered
driven
away
and
extinguished
when
the
master
saw
this
he
shouted
aloud
for
joy
calling
out
and
leaping
from
the
ground
in
ecstacy
but
when
he
was
in
the
very
paroxysm
of
exultation
the
great
dragon
came
round
with
a
circular
motion
behind
the
castle
and
approaching
behind
the
wizard
back
before
he
was
aware
seized
him
by
the
hair
with
one
paw
and
by
the
iron
belt
with
the
other
and
bore
him
off
into
the
air
straight
upward
the
master
struggled
and
writhed
very
hard
but
never
opened
his
lips
at
length
after
great
exertion
he
struck
the
monster
a
blow
with
his
rod
that
made
him
quit
his
hold
and
fly
away
yelling
after
his
discomfited
legions
the
master
fell
to
the
ground
from
a
great
height
and
lay
still
and
when
i
saw
no
one
to
come
near
him
i
left
the
corner
where
i
had
hid
myself
and
ran
to
his
assistance
but
he
was
quite
dead
his
teeth
had
severed
his
tongue
in
two
and
were
clenched
close
together
his
eyes
were
open
and
every
bone
of
his
body
was
broken
having
witnessed
the
unspeakable
value
of
the
golden
rod
i
put
out
my
hand
and
took
hold
of
it
wanting
to
bring
it
away
with
me
but
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
have
heaved
the
castle
from
its
foundations
besides
when
i
tugged
at
it
the
dead
man
turned
his
eyes
toward
me
with
a
fierceness
that
chilled
me
to
the
heart
so
i
fled
and
came
hitherward
with
all
my
might
he
is
lying
in
a
little
hidden
valley
at
the
side
of
the
burn
immediately
above
the
castle
with
the
book
of
fate
locked
in
his
bosom
his
rod
in
his
hand
and
his
eyes
open
i
have
now
described
to
your
majesties
this
scene
exactly
as
i
saw
it
but
i
must
also
tell
you
that
when
i
came
to
the
mill
both
the
miller
and
his
man
neither
of
whom
knew
me
said
it
had
been
an
awful
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
i
asked
if
they
perceived
nothing
about
it
but
a
common
storm
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
they
said
nothing
save
that
it
was
exceedingly
violent
and
rather
uncommon
at
such
a
season
of
the
year
i
have
therefore
some
suspicions
that
there
might
be
magical
delusion
operating
on
my
sight
but
of
this
i
am
certain
that
the
great
enchanter
was
carried
up
into
the
middle
space
between
heaven
and
earth
fell
down
and
was
killed
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
said
the
king
that
what
you
have
told
us
is
the
plain
and
unvarnished
truth
though
perhaps
the
rod
of
divination
might
open
your
eyes
to
see
the
storm
in
a
different
light
from
that
seen
by
the
eyes
of
common
men
of
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
greatest
man
and
the
most
profound
scholar
of
the
age
has
perished
in
this
conflict
of
the
elements
he
has
not
only
kept
the
world
in
awe
but
in
dreadful
agitation
for
the
space
of
thirty
years
let
us
therefore
all
go
and
see
him
honourably
interred
i
ask
no
rites
of
sepulture
to
be
performed
over
his
remains
which
if
living
he
would
have
deprecated
only
let
us
all
go
and
see
his
body
reverendly
deposited
in
the
tomb
lest
it
be
left
to
consume
in
the
open
fields
they
went
and
found
him
lying
as
stated
only
that
his
eyes
were
shut
some
of
his
attendant
elves
having
closed
them
over
night
his
book
was
in
his
bosom
and
his
rod
in
his
hand
from
either
of
which
no
force
of
man
could
sever
them
although
when
they
lifted
the
body
and
these
together
there
was
no
difference
in
weight
from
the
body
of
another
man
the
king
then
caused
these
dangerous
relics
to
be
deposited
along
with
the
body
in
an
iron
chest
which
they
buried
in
a
vaulted
aisle
of
the
abbey
of
melrose
and
the
castle
of
aikwood

never
more
