dona
perfecta
by
perez
galdos
translated
from
the
spanish
by
mary
serrano
introduction
the
very
acute
and
lively
spanish
critic
who
signs
himself
clarin
and
is
known
personally
as
don
leopoldo
alas
says
the
present
spanish
novel
has
no
yesterday
but
only
a
it
does
not
derive
from
the
romantic
novel
which
immediately
preceded
that
the
novel
large
or
little
as
it
was
with
cervantes
hurtado
de
mendoza
quevedo
and
the
masters
of
picaresque
fiction
clarin
dates
its
renascence
from
the
political
revolution
of
which
gave
spanish
literature
the
freedom
necessary
to
the
fiction
that
studies
to
reflect
modern
life
actual
ideas
and
current
aspirations
and
though
its
authors
were
few
at
first
they
have
never
been
adventurous
spirits
friends
of
utopia
revolutionists
or
impatient
progressists
and
he
thinks
that
the
most
daring
the
most
advanced
of
the
new
spanish
novelists
and
the
best
by
far
is
don
benito
perez
galdos
i
should
myself
have
made
my
little
exception
in
favor
of
don
armando
palacio
valdes
but
clarin
speaks
with
infinitely
more
authority
and
i
am
certainly
ready
to
submit
when
he
goes
on
to
say
that
galdos
is
not
a
social
or
literary
insurgent
that
he
has
no
political
or
religious
prejudices
that
he
shuns
extremes
and
is
charmed
with
prudence
that
his
novels
do
not
attack
the
catholic
dogmas
though
they
deal
so
severely
with
catholic
bigotry
but
the
customs
and
ideas
cherished
by
secular
fanaticism
to
the
injury
of
the
church
because
this
is
so
evident
our
critic
holds
his
novels
are
found
in
the
bosom
of
families
in
every
corner
of
their
popularity
among
all
classes
in
catholic
and
prejudiced
spain
and
not
among
students
merely
bears
testimony
to
the
fact
that
his
aim
and
motive
are
understood
and
appreciated
although
his
stories
are
apparently
so
often
i
dona
perfecta
is
first
of
all
a
story
and
a
great
story
but
it
is
certainly
also
a
story
that
must
appear
at
times
potently
and
even
bitterly
yet
it
would
be
a
pity
and
an
error
to
read
it
with
the
preoccupation
that
it
was
an
tract
for
really
it
is
not
that
if
the
persons
were
changed
in
name
and
place
and
modified
in
passion
to
fit
a
cooler
air
it
might
equally
seem
an
or
tract
for
what
it
shows
in
the
light
of
their
own
hatefulness
and
cruelty
are
perversions
of
any
religion
any
creed
it
is
not
however
a
tract
at
all
it
deals
in
artistic
largeness
with
the
passion
of
bigotry
as
it
deals
with
the
passion
of
love
the
passion
of
ambition
the
passion
of
revenge
but
galdos
is
spanish
and
catholic
and
for
him
the
bigotry
wears
a
spanish
and
catholic
face
that
is
all
up
to
a
certain
time
i
believe
galdos
wrote
romantic
or
idealistic
novels
and
one
of
these
i
have
read
and
it
tired
me
very
much
it
was
called
marianela
and
it
surprised
me
the
more
because
i
was
already
acquainted
with
his
later
work
which
is
all
realistic
but
one
does
not
turn
realist
in
a
single
night
and
although
the
change
in
galdos
was
rapid
it
was
not
quite
a
lightning
change
perhaps
because
it
was
not
merely
an
outward
change
but
artistically
a
change
of
heart
his
acceptance
in
his
quality
of
realist
was
much
more
instant
than
his
conversion
and
vastly
wider
for
we
are
told
by
the
critic
whom
i
have
been
quoting
that
galdos
s
earlier
efforts
which
he
called
never
had
the
vogue
which
his
realistic
novels
have
enjoyed
these
were
indeed
tendencious
if
i
may
anglicize
a
very
necessary
word
from
the
spanish
that
is
they
dealt
with
very
obvious
problems
and
had
very
distinct
and
poignant
significations
at
least
in
the
case
of
dona
perfecta
leon
roch
and
in
still
later
novels
emilia
thinks
he
has
comprehended
that
the
novel
of
must
take
note
of
the
ambient
truth
and
realize
the
beautiful
with
freedom
and
this
valiant
lady
in
the
campaign
for
realism
which
she
made
under
the
title
of
la
cuestion
palpitante
one
of
the
best
and
strongest
books
on
the
subject
counts
him
first
among
spanish
realists
as
clarin
counts
him
first
among
spanish
novelists
with
a
certain
fundamental
humanity
she
says
a
certain
magisterial
simplicity
in
his
creations
with
the
natural
tendency
of
his
clear
intelligence
toward
the
truth
and
with
the
frankness
of
his
observation
the
great
novelist
was
always
disposed
to
pass
over
to
realism
with
arms
and
munitions
but
his
aesthetic
inclinations
were
idealistic
and
only
in
his
latest
works
has
he
adopted
the
method
of
the
modern
novel
fathomed
more
and
more
the
human
heart
and
broken
once
for
all
with
the
picturesque
and
with
the
typical
personages
to
embrace
the
earth
we
for
her
as
i
confess
for
me
dona
perfecta
is
not
realistic
enough
realistic
as
it
is
for
realism
at
its
best
is
not
tendencious
it
does
not
seek
to
grapple
with
human
problems
but
is
richly
content
with
portraying
human
experiences
and
i
think
senora
is
right
in
regarding
dona
perfecta
as
transitional
and
of
a
period
when
the
author
had
not
yet
assimilated
in
its
fullest
meaning
the
faith
he
had
imbibed
ii
yet
it
is
a
great
novel
as
i
said
and
perhaps
because
it
is
transitional
it
will
please
the
greater
number
who
never
really
arrive
anywhere
and
who
like
to
find
themselves
in
good
company
it
is
so
far
like
life
that
it
is
full
of
significations
which
pass
beyond
the
persons
and
actions
involved
and
envelop
the
reader
as
if
he
too
were
a
character
of
the
book
or
rather
as
if
its
persons
were
men
and
women
of
this
thinking
feeling
and
breathing
world
and
he
must
recognize
their
experiences
as
veritable
facts
from
the
first
moment
to
the
last
it
is
like
some
passage
of
actual
events
in
which
you
can
not
withhold
your
compassion
your
abhorrence
your
admiration
any
more
than
if
they
took
place
within
your
personal
knowledge
where
they
transcend
all
facts
of
your
personal
knowledge
you
do
not
accuse
them
of
improbability
for
you
feel
their
potentiality
in
yourself
and
easily
account
for
them
in
the
alien
circumstance
i
am
not
saying
that
the
story
has
no
faults
it
has
several
there
are
tags
of
romanticism
fluttering
about
it
here
and
there
and
at
times
the
author
permits
himself
certain
literary
airs
and
poses
and
artifices
which
you
simply
wonder
at
it
is
in
spite
of
these
and
with
all
these
defects
that
it
is
so
great
and
beautiful
a
book
iii
what
seems
to
be
so
very
admirable
in
the
management
of
the
story
is
the
author
s
success
in
keeping
his
own
counsel
this
may
seem
a
very
easy
thing
but
if
the
reader
will
think
over
the
novelists
of
his
acquaintance
he
will
find
that
it
is
at
least
very
uncommon
they
mostly
give
themselves
away
almost
from
the
beginning
either
by
their
anxiety
to
hide
what
is
coming
or
their
vanity
in
hinting
what
great
things
they
have
in
store
for
the
reader
galdos
does
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
he
makes
it
his
business
to
tell
the
story
as
it
grows
to
let
the
characters
unfold
themselves
in
speech
and
action
to
permit
the
events
to
happen
unheralded
he
does
not
prophesy
their
course
he
does
not
forecast
the
weather
even
for
hours
the
atmosphere
becomes
slowly
slowly
but
with
occasional
lifts
and
reliefs
of
such
a
brooding
breathlessness
of
such
a
deepening
density
that
you
feel
the
wild
nearer
and
nearer
at
hand
till
it
bursts
at
last
and
then
you
are
astonished
that
you
had
not
foreseen
it
yourself
from
the
first
moment
next
to
this
excellent
method
which
i
count
the
supreme
characteristic
of
the
book
merely
because
it
represents
the
whole
and
the
other
facts
are
in
the
nature
of
parts
is
the
masterly
conception
of
the
characters
they
are
each
typical
of
a
certain
side
of
human
nature
as
most
of
our
personal
friends
and
enemies
are
but
not
exclusively
of
this
side
or
that
they
are
each
of
mixed
motives
mixed
qualities
none
of
them
is
quite
a
monster
though
those
who
are
badly
mixed
do
such
monstrous
things
pepe
rey
who
is
such
a
good
fellow
so
kind
and
brave
and
upright
and
generous
so
fine
a
mind
and
so
high
a
soul
is
tactless
and
imprudent
he
even
condescends
to
the
thought
of
intrigue
and
though
he
rejects
his
plots
at
last
his
nature
has
once
harbored
deceit
don
inocencio
the
priest
whose
control
of
dona
perfecta
s
conscience
has
vitiated
the
very
springs
of
goodness
in
her
is
by
no
means
bad
aside
from
his
purposes
he
loves
his
sister
and
her
son
tenderly
and
wishes
to
provide
for
them
by
the
marriage
which
pepe
s
presence
threatens
to
prevent
the
nephew
though
selfish
and
little
has
moments
of
almost
being
a
good
fellow
the
sister
though
she
is
really
such
a
lamb
of
meekness
becomes
a
cat
and
scratches
don
inocencio
dreadfully
when
he
weakens
in
his
design
against
pepe
rosario
one
of
the
sweetest
and
purest
images
of
girlhood
that
i
know
in
fiction
abandons
herself
with
equal
passion
to
the
love
she
feels
for
her
cousin
pepe
and
to
the
love
she
feels
for
her
mother
dona
perfecta
she
is
ready
to
fly
with
him
and
yet
she
betrays
him
to
her
mother
s
pitiless
hate
but
it
is
dona
perfecta
herself
who
is
the
transcendent
figure
the
most
powerful
creation
of
the
book
in
her
bigotry
and
its
hypocrisy
have
done
their
perfect
work
until
she
comes
near
to
being
a
devil
and
really
does
some
devil
s
deeds
yet
even
she
is
not
without
some
extenuating
traits
her
bigotry
springs
from
her
conscience
and
she
is
truly
devoted
to
her
daughter
s
eternal
welfare
she
is
of
such
a
native
frankness
that
at
a
certain
point
she
tears
aside
her
mask
of
dissimulation
and
lets
pepe
see
all
the
ugliness
of
her
perverted
soul
she
is
wonderfully
managed
at
what
moment
does
she
begin
to
hate
him
and
to
wish
to
undo
her
own
work
in
making
a
match
between
him
and
her
daughter
i
could
defy
anyone
to
say
all
one
knows
is
that
at
one
moment
she
adores
her
brother
s
son
and
at
another
she
abhors
him
and
has
already
subtly
entered
upon
her
efforts
to
thwart
the
affection
she
has
invited
in
him
for
her
daughter
caballuco
what
shall
i
say
of
caballuco
he
seems
altogether
bad
but
the
author
lets
one
imagine
that
this
cruel
this
ruthless
brute
must
have
somewhere
about
him
traits
of
lovableness
of
leniency
though
he
never
lets
one
see
them
his
gratitude
to
dona
perfecta
even
his
murderous
devotion
is
not
altogether
bad
and
he
is
certainly
worse
than
nature
made
him
when
wrought
upon
by
her
fury
and
the
suggestion
of
don
inocencio
the
scene
where
they
work
him
up
to
rebellion
and
assassination
is
a
compendium
of
the
history
of
intolerance
as
the
mean
little
conceited
city
of
orbajosas
is
the
microcosm
of
bigoted
and
reactionary
spain
iv
i
have
called
or
this
book
tendencious
but
in
a
certain
larger
view
it
is
not
so
it
is
the
eternal
interest
of
passion
working
upon
passion
not
the
temporary
interest
of
condition
antagonizing
condition
which
renders
dona
perfecta
so
poignantly
interesting
and
which
makes
its
tragedy
immense
but
there
is
hope
as
well
as
despair
in
such
a
tragedy
there
is
the
strange
support
of
a
bereavement
in
it
the
consolation
of
feeling
that
for
those
who
have
suffered
unto
death
nothing
can
harm
them
more
that
even
for
those
who
have
inflicted
their
suffering
this
peace
will
soon
come

if

five
minutes
when
the
down
train
no
of
what
line
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
stopped
at
the
little
station
between
kilometres
and
almost
all
the
passengers
remained
in
the
cars
yawning
or
asleep
for
the
penetrating
cold
of
the
early
morning
did
not
invite
to
a
walk
on
the
unsheltered
platform
the
only
passenger
on
the
train
alighted
quickly
and
addressing
a
group
of
the
employes
asked
them
if
this
was
the
villahorrenda
station
we
are
in
villahorrenda
answered
the
conductor
whose
voice
was
drowned
by
the
cackling
of
the
hens
which
were
at
that
moment
being
lifted
into
the
freight
car
i
forgot
to
call
you
senor
de
rey
i
think
they
are
waiting
for
you
at
the
station
with
the
why
how
terribly
cold
it
is
here
said
the
traveller
drawing
his
cloak
more
closely
about
him
is
there
no
place
in
the
station
where
i
could
rest
for
a
while
and
get
warm
before
undertaking
a
journey
on
horseback
through
this
frozen
country
before
he
had
finished
speaking
the
conductor
called
away
by
the
urgent
duties
of
his
position
went
off
leaving
our
unknown
cavalier
s
question
unanswered
the
latter
saw
that
another
employe
was
coming
toward
him
holding
a
lantern
in
his
right
hand
that
swung
back
and
forth
as
he
walked
casting
the
light
on
the
platform
of
the
station
in
a
series
of
zigzags
like
those
described
by
the
shower
from
a
is
there
a
restaurant
or
a
bedroom
in
the
station
of
villahorrenda
said
the
traveller
to
the
man
with
the
lantern
there
is
nothing
here
answered
the
latter
brusquely
running
toward
the
men
who
were
putting
the
freight
on
board
the
cars
and
assuaging
them
with
such
a
volley
of
oaths
blasphemies
and
abusive
epithets
that
the
very
chickens
scandalized
by
his
brutality
protested
against
it
from
their
baskets
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
get
away
from
this
place
as
quickly
as
possible
said
the
gentlemen
to
himself
the
conductor
said
that
the
beasts
were
just
as
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
he
felt
a
thin
hand
pulling
him
gently
and
respectfully
by
the
cloak
he
turned
round
and
saw
a
figure
enveloped
in
a
gray
cloak
and
out
of
whose
voluminous
folds
peeped
the
shrivelled
and
astute
countenance
of
a
castilian
peasant
he
looked
at
the
ungainly
figure
which
reminded
one
of
the
black
poplar
among
trees
he
observed
the
shrewd
eyes
that
shone
from
beneath
the
wide
brim
of
the
old
velvet
hat
the
sinewy
brown
hand
that
grasped
a
green
switch
and
the
broad
foot
that
with
every
movement
made
the
iron
spur
jingle
are
you
senor
don
jose

asked
the
peasant
raising
his
hand
to
his
hat
yes
and
you

take
it
answered
the
traveller
joyfully
are
dona

come
to
the
station
to
meet
me
and
show
me
the

same
whenever
you
are
ready
to
start
the
pony
runs
like
the
wind

i
am
sure

a
good
rider
for
what

asked
the
traveller
with
impatience
come
let
us
start

answered
the
man
of
the
gray
cloak
again
making
a
motion
to
take
off
his
hat
but
they
call
me
uncle
licurgo
where
is
the
young
gentleman
s
baggage
there
it
is
there
under
the
cloak
there
are
three
pieces
two
portmanteaus
and
a
box
of
books
for
senor
don
cayetano
here
is
the
a
moment
later
cavalier
and
squire
found
themselves
behind
the
barracks
called
a
depot
and
facing
a
road
which
starting
at
this
point
disappeared
among
the
neighboring
hills
on
whose
naked
slopes
could
be
vaguely
distinguished
the
miserable
hamlet
of
villahorrenda
there
were
three
animals
to
carry
the
men
and
the
luggage
a
not
nag
was
destined
for
the
cavalier
uncle
licurgo
was
to
ride
a
venerable
hack
somewhat
loose
in
the
joints
but
and
the
mule
which
was
to
be
led
by
a
stout
country
boy
of
active
limbs
and
fiery
blood
was
to
carry
the
luggage
before
the
caravan
had
put
itself
in
motion
the
train
had
started
and
was
now
creeping
along
the
road
with
the
lazy
deliberation
of
a
way
train
awakening
as
it
receded
in
the
distance
deep
subterranean
echoes
as
it
entered
the
tunnel
at
kilometre
the
steam
issued
from
the
steam
whistle
with
a
shriek
that
resounded
through
the
air
from
the
dark
mouth
of
the
tunnel
came
volumes
of
whitish
smoke
a
succession
of
shrill
screams
like
the
blasts
of
a
trumpet
followed
and
at
the
sound
of
its
stentorian
voice
villages
towns
the
whole
surrounding
country
awoke
here
a
cock
began
to
crow
further
on
another
day
was
beginning
to
dawn
chapter
ii
a
journey
in
the
heart
of
spain
when
they
had
proceeded
some
distance
on
their
way
and
had
left
behind
them
the
hovels
of
villahorrenda
the
traveller
who
was
young
and
handsome
spoke
thus
tell
me
senor
solon
licurgo
at
your
senor
licurgo
i
mean
but
i
was
right
in
giving
you
the
name
of
a
wise
legislator
of
antiquity
excuse
the
mistake
but
to
come
to
the
point
tell
me
how
is
my
aunt
as
handsome
as
ever
answered
the
peasant
pushing
his
beast
forward
a
little
time
seems
to
stand
still
with
senora
dona
perfecta
they
say
that
god
gives
long
life
to
the
good
and
if
that
is
so
that
angel
of
the
lord
ought
to
live
a
thousand
years
if
all
the
blessings
that
are
showered
on
her
in
this
world
were
feathers
the
senora
would
need
no
other
wings
to
go
up
to
heaven
and
my
cousin
senorita
rosario
the
senora
over
again
said
the
peasant
what
more
can
i
tell
you
of
dona
rosarito
but
that
that
she
is
the
living
image
of
her
mother
you
will
have
a
treasure
senor
don
jose
if
it
is
true
as
i
hear
that
you
have
come
to
be
married
to
her
she
will
be
a
worthy
mate
for
you
and
the
young
lady
will
have
nothing
to
complain
of
either
between
pedro
and
pedro
the
difference
is
not
very
and
senor
don
cayetano
buried
in
his
books
as
usual
he
has
a
library
bigger
than
the
cathedral
and
he
roots
up
the
earth
besides
searching
for
stones
covered
with
fantastical
scrawls
that
were
written
they
say
by
the
how
soon
shall
we
reach
orbajosa
by
nine
o
clock
god
willing
how
delighted
the
senora
will
be
when
she
sees
her
nephew
and
yesterday
senorita
rosario
was
putting
the
room
you
are
to
have
in
order
as
they
have
never
seen
you
both
mother
and
daughter
think
of
nothing
else
but
what
senor
don
jose
is
like
or
is
not
like
the
time
has
now
come
for
letters
to
be
silent
and
tongues
to
talk
the
young
lady
will
see
her
cousin
and
all
will
be
joy
and
if
god
wills
all
will
end
happily
as
the
saying
as
neither
my
aunt
nor
my
cousin
has
yet
seen
me
said
the
traveller
smiling
it
is
not
wise
to
make
that
s
true
for
that
reason
it
was
said
that
the
bay
horse
is
of
one
mind
and
he
who
saddles
him
of
another
answered
the
peasant
but
the
face
does
not
lie
what
a
jewel
you
are
getting
and
she
what
a
handsome
man
the
young
man
did
not
hear
uncle
licurgo
s
last
words
for
he
was
preoccupied
with
his
own
thoughts
arrived
at
a
bend
in
the
road
the
peasant
turned
his
horse
s
head
in
another
direction
saying
we
must
follow
this
path
now
the
bridge
is
broken
and
the
river
can
only
be
forded
at
the
hill
of
the
the
hill
of
the
lilies
repeated
the
cavalier
emerging
from
his
revery
how
abundant
beautiful
names
are
in
these
unattractive
localities
since
i
have
been
travelling
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
terrible
irony
of
the
names
is
a
constant
surprise
to
me
some
place
that
is
remarkable
for
its
barren
aspect
and
the
desolate
sadness
of
the
landscape
is
called
valleameno
pleasant
valley
some
wretched
village
stretched
on
a
barren
plain
and
proclaiming
its
poverty
in
diverse
ways
has
the
insolence
to
call
itself
villarica
rich
town
and
some
arid
and
stony
ravine
where
not
even
the
thistles
can
find
nourishment
calls
itself
nevertheless
valdeflores
vale
of
flowers
that
hill
in
front
of
us
is
the
hill
of
the
lilies
but
where
in
heaven
s
name
are
the
lilies
i
see
nothing
but
stones
and
withered
grass
call
it
hill
of
desolation
and
you
will
be
right
with
the
exception
of
villahorrenda
whose
appearance
corresponds
with
its
name
all
is
irony
here
beautiful
words
a
prosaic
and
mean
reality
the
blind
would
be
happy
in
this
country
which
for
the
tongue
is
a
paradise
and
for
the
eyes
a
senor
licurgo
either
did
not
hear
the
young
man
s
words
or
hearing
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
when
they
had
forded
the
river
which
turbid
and
impetuous
hurried
on
with
impatient
haste
as
if
fleeing
from
its
own
hands
the
peasant
pointed
with
outstretched
arm
to
some
barren
and
extensive
fields
that
were
to
be
seen
on
the
left
and
said
those
are
the
poplars
of
my
lands
exclaimed
the
traveller
joyfully
gazing
at
the
melancholy
fields
illumined
by
the
early
morning
light
for
the
first
time
i
see
the
patrimony
which
i
inherited
from
my
mother
the
poor
woman
used
to
praise
this
country
so
extravagantly
and
tell
me
so
many
marvellous
things
about
it
when
i
was
a
child
that
i
thought
that
to
be
here
was
to
be
in
heaven
fruits
flowers
game
large
and
small
mountains
lakes
rivers
romantic
streams
pastoral
hills
all
were
to
be
found
in
the
poplars
of
bustamante
in
this
favored
land
the
best
and
most
beautiful
on
the
earth
but
what
is
to
be
said
the
people
of
this
place
live
in
their
imaginations
if
i
had
been
brought
here
in
my
youth
when
i
shared
the
ideas
and
the
enthusiasm
of
my
dear
mother
i
suppose
that
i
too
would
have
been
enchanted
with
these
bare
hills
these
arid
or
marshy
plains
these
dilapidated
farmhouses
these
rickety
norias
whose
buckets
drip
water
enough
to
sprinkle
half
a
dozen
cabbages
this
wretched
and
barren
desolation
that
surrounds
it
is
the
best
land
in
the
country
said
senor
licurgo
and
for
the
there
is
no
other
like
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
for
since
they
came
into
my
possession
these
famous
lands
have
never
brought
me
a
the
wise
legislator
of
sparta
scratched
his
ear
and
gave
a
sigh
but
i
have
been
told
continued
the
young
man
that
some
of
the
neighboring
proprietors
have
put
their
ploughs
in
these
estates
of
mine
and
that
little
by
little
they
are
filching
them
from
me
here
there
are
neither
landmarks
nor
boundaries
nor
real
ownership
senor
the
peasant
after
a
pause
during
which
his
subtle
intellect
seemed
to
be
occupied
in
profound
disquisitions
expressed
himself
as
follows
uncle
paso
largo
whom
for
his
great
foresight
we
call
the
philosopher
set
his
plough
in
the
poplars
above
the
hermitage
and
bit
by
bit
he
has
gobbled
up
six
what
an
incomparable
school
exclaimed
the
young
man
smiling
i
wager
that
he
has
not
been
the
only
philosopher
it
is
a
true
saying
that
one
should
talk
only
about
what
one
knows
and
that
if
there
is
food
in
the
doves
won
t
be
wanting
but
you
senor
don
jose
can
apply
to
your
own
cause
the
saying
that
the
eye
of
the
master
fattens
the
ox
and
now
that
you
are
here
try
and
recover
your
perhaps
that
would
not
be
so
easy
senor
licurgo
returned
the
young
man
just
as
they
were
entering
a
path
bordered
on
either
side
by
whose
luxuriance
and
early
ripeness
gladdened
the
eye
this
field
appears
to
be
better
cultivated
i
see
that
all
is
not
dreariness
and
misery
in
the
the
peasant
assumed
a
melancholy
look
and
affecting
something
of
disdain
for
the
fields
that
had
been
praised
by
the
traveller
said
in
the
humblest
of
tones
senor
this
is
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
the
gentleman
quickly
now
i
was
going
to
put
my
sickle
in
your
field
apparently
the
philosophy
of
this
place
is
they
now
descended
into
a
canebrake
which
formed
the
bed
of
a
shallow
and
stagnant
brook
and
crossing
it
they
entered
a
field
full
of
stones
and
without
the
slightest
trace
of
vegetation
this
ground
is
very
bad
said
the
young
man
turning
round
to
look
at
his
companion
and
guide
who
had
remained
a
little
behind
you
will
hardly
be
able
to
derive
any
profit
from
it
for
it
is
all
mud
and
licurgo
full
of
humility
answered
this
is
i
see
that
all
the
poor
land
is
mine
declared
the
young
man
laughing
as
they
were
thus
conversing
they
turned
again
into
the
the
morning
sunshine
pouring
joyously
through
all
the
gates
and
balconies
of
the
spanish
horizon
had
now
inundated
the
fields
with
brilliant
light
the
wide
sky
undimmed
by
a
single
cloud
seemed
to
grow
wider
and
to
recede
further
from
the
earth
in
order
to
contemplate
it
and
rejoice
in
the
contemplation
from
a
greater
height
the
desolate
treeless
land
at
intervals
at
intervals
of
the
color
of
chalk
and
all
cut
up
into
triangles
and
quadrilaterals
yellow
or
black
gray
or
pale
green
bore
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
a
beggar
s
cloak
spread
out
in
the
sun
on
that
miserable
cloak
christianity
and
islamism
had
fought
with
each
other
epic
battles
glorious
fields
in
truth
but
the
combats
of
the
past
had
left
them
hideous
i
think
we
shall
have
a
scorching
day
senor
licurgo
said
the
young
man
loosening
his
cloak
a
little
what
a
dreary
road
not
a
single
tree
to
be
seen
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
here
everything
is
in
contradiction
the
irony
does
not
cease
why
when
there
are
no
poplars
here
either
large
or
small
should
this
be
called
the
poplars
uncle
licurgo
did
not
answer
this
question
because
he
was
listening
with
his
whole
soul
to
certain
sounds
which
were
suddenly
heard
in
the
distance
and
with
an
uneasy
air
he
stopped
his
beast
while
he
explored
the
road
and
the
distant
hills
with
a
gloomy
look
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
traveller
stopping
his
horse
also
do
you
carry
arms
don
jose
a
revolver
ah
now
i
understand
are
there
robbers
about
perhaps
answered
the
peasant
with
visible
apprehension
i
think
i
heard
a
we
shall
soon
see
forward
said
the
young
man
putting
spurs
to
his
nag
they
are
not
very
terrible
i
dare
keep
quiet
senor
don
jose
exclaimed
the
peasant
stopping
him
those
people
are
worse
than
satan
himself
the
other
day
they
murdered
two
gentlemen
who
were
on
their
way
to
take
the
train
let
us
leave
off
jesting
gasparon
el
fuerte
pepito
chispillas
merengue
and
ahorca
suegras
shall
not
see
my
face
while
i
live
let
us
turn
into
the
forward
senor
licurgo
back
senor
don
jose
replied
the
peasant
in
distressed
accents
you
don
t
know
what
kind
of
people
those
are
they
are
the
same
men
who
stole
the
chalice
the
virgin
s
crown
and
two
candlesticks
from
the
church
of
the
carmen
last
month
they
are
the
men
who
robbed
the
madrid
train
two
years
don
jose
hearing
these
alarming
antecedents
felt
his
courage
begin
to
give
way
do
you
see
that
great
high
hill
in
the
distance
well
that
is
where
those
rascals
hide
themselves
there
in
some
caves
which
they
call
the
retreat
of
the
of
the
cavaliers
yes
senor
they
come
down
to
the
when
the
civil
guards
are
not
watching
and
rob
all
they
can
do
you
see
a
cross
beyond
the
bend
of
the
road
well
that
was
erected
in
remembrance
of
the
death
of
the
alcalde
of
villahorrenda
whom
they
murdered
there
at
the
time
of
the
yes
i
see
the
there
is
an
old
house
there
in
which
they
hide
themselves
to
wait
for
the
carriers
they
call
that
place
the
the
pleasaunce
if
all
the
people
who
have
been
murdered
and
robbed
there
were
to
be
restored
they
would
form
an
while
they
were
thus
talking
shots
were
again
heard
this
time
nearer
than
before
which
made
the
valiant
hearts
of
the
travellers
quake
a
little
but
not
that
of
the
country
lad
who
jumping
about
for
joy
asked
senor
licurgo
s
permission
to
go
forward
to
watch
the
conflict
which
was
taking
place
so
near
them
observing
the
courage
of
the
boy
don
jose
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
having
been
frightened
or
at
least
a
little
disturbed
by
the
proximity
of
the
robbers
and
cried
putting
spurs
to
his
nag
we
will
go
forward
then
perhaps
we
may
be
able
to
lend
assistance
to
the
unlucky
travellers
who
find
themselves
in
so
perilous
a
situation
and
give
a
lesson
besides
to
those
the
peasant
endeavored
to
convince
the
young
man
of
the
rashness
of
his
purpose
as
well
as
of
the
profitlessness
of
his
generous
design
since
those
who
had
been
robbed
were
robbed
and
perhaps
dead
also
and
not
in
a
condition
to
need
the
assistance
of
any
one
the
gentleman
insisted
in
spite
of
these
sage
counsels
the
peasant
reiterated
his
objections
more
strongly
than
before
when
the
appearance
of
two
or
three
carters
coming
quietly
down
the
road
driving
a
wagon
put
an
end
to
the
controversy
the
danger
could
not
be
very
great
when
these
men
were
coming
along
so
unconcernedly
singing
merry
songs
and
such
was
in
fact
the
case
for
the
shots
according
to
what
the
carters
said
had
not
been
fired
by
the
robbers
but
by
the
civil
guards
who
desired
in
this
way
to
prevent
the
escape
of
half
a
dozen
thieves
whom
they
were
taking
bound
together
to
the
town
jail
yes
i
know
now
what
it
was
said
licurgo
pointing
to
a
light
cloud
of
smoke
which
was
to
be
seen
some
distance
off
to
the
right
of
the
road
they
have
peppered
them
there
that
happens
every
other
the
young
man
did
not
understand
i
assure
you
senor
don
jose
added
the
lacedaemonian
legislator
with
energy
that
it
was
very
well
done
for
it
is
of
no
use
to
try
those
rascals
the
judge
them
a
little
and
then
lets
them
go
if
at
the
end
of
a
trial
dragged
out
for
half
a
dozen
years
one
of
them
is
sent
to
jail
at
the
moment
least
expected
he
escapes
and
returns
to
the
retreat
of
the
cavaliers
that
is
the
best
thing
to
do
shoot
them
take
them
to
prison
and
when
you
are
passing
a
suitable
place
ah
dog
so
you
want
to
escape
do
you
pum
pum
the
indictment
is
drawn
up
the
witnesses
summoned
the
trial
ended
the
sentence
pronounced
all
in
a
minute
it
is
a
true
saying
that
the
fox
is
very
cunning
but
he
who
catches
him
is
more
cunning
forward
then
and
let
us
ride
faster
for
this
road
besides
being
a
long
one
is
not
at
all
a
pleasant
one
said
rey
as
they
passed
the
pleasaunce
they
saw
a
little
in
from
the
road
the
guards
who
a
few
minutes
before
had
executed
the
strange
sentence
with
which
the
reader
has
been
made
acquainted
the
country
boy
was
inconsolable
because
they
rode
on
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
get
a
nearer
view
of
the
palpitating
bodies
of
the
robbers
which
could
be
distinguished
forming
a
horrible
group
in
the
distance
but
they
had
not
proceeded
twenty
paces
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
after
them
at
so
rapid
a
pace
that
he
gained
upon
them
every
moment
our
traveller
turned
round
and
saw
a
man
or
rather
a
centaur
for
the
most
perfect
harmony
imaginable
existed
between
horse
and
rider
the
latter
was
of
a
robust
and
plethoric
constitution
with
large
fiery
eyes
rugged
features
and
a
black
mustache
he
was
of
middle
age
and
had
a
general
air
of
rudeness
and
aggressiveness
with
indications
of
strength
in
his
whole
person
he
was
mounted
on
a
superb
horse
with
a
muscular
chest
like
the
horses
of
the
parthenon
caparisoned
in
the
picturesque
fashion
of
the
country
and
carrying
on
the
crupper
a
great
leather
bag
on
the
cover
of
which
was
to
be
seen
in
large
letters
the
word
mail
hello
senor
caballuco
said
licurgo
saluting
the
horseman
when
the
latter
had
come
up
with
them
how
is
it
that
we
got
so
far
ahead
of
you
but
you
will
arrive
before
us
if
you
set
your
mind
to
i
will
rest
a
little
answered
senor
caballuco
adapting
his
horse
s
pace
to
that
of
our
travellers
beasts
and
attentively
observing
the
most
distinguished
of
the
three
since
there
is
such
good
this
gentleman
said
licurgo
smiling
is
the
nephew
of
dona
ah
at
your
service
the
two
men
saluted
each
other
it
being
noticeable
that
caballuco
performed
his
civilities
with
an
expression
of
haughtiness
and
superiority
that
revealed
at
the
very
least
a
consciousness
of
great
importance
and
of
a
high
standing
in
the
district
when
the
arrogant
horseman
rode
aside
to
stop
and
talk
for
a
moment
with
two
civil
guards
who
passed
them
on
the
road
the
traveller
asked
his
guide
who
is
that
odd
character
who
should
it
be
and
who
is
caballuco
what
have
you
never
heard
of
caballuco
said
the
countryman
amazed
at
the
crass
ignorance
of
dona
perfecta
s
nephew
he
is
a
very
brave
man
a
fine
rider
and
the
best
connoisseur
of
horses
in
all
the
surrounding
country
we
think
a
great
deal
of
him
in
orbajosa
and
he
is
well
worthy
of
it
just
as
you
see
him
he
is
a
power
in
the
place
and
the
governor
of
the
province
takes
off
his
hat
to
when
there
is
an
election
and
the
governor
of
madrid
writes
official
letters
to
him
with
a
great
many
titles
in
the
superscription
he
throws
the
bar
like
a
christopher
and
he
can
manage
every
kind
of
weapon
as
easily
as
we
manage
our
fingers
when
there
was
market
inspection
here
they
could
never
get
the
best
of
him
and
shots
were
to
be
heard
every
night
at
the
city
gates
he
has
a
following
that
is
worth
any
money
for
they
are
ready
for
anything
he
is
good
to
the
poor
and
any
stranger
who
should
come
here
and
attempt
to
touch
so
much
as
a
hair
of
the
head
of
any
native
of
orbajosa
would
have
him
to
settle
with
it
is
very
seldom
that
soldiers
come
here
from
madrid
but
whenever
they
do
come
not
a
day
passes
without
blood
being
shed
for
caballuco
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
them
if
not
for
one
thing
for
another
at
present
it
seems
that
he
is
fallen
into
poverty
and
he
is
employed
to
carry
the
mail
but
he
is
trying
hard
to
persuade
the
town
council
to
have
a
s
office
here
again
and
to
put
him
in
charge
of
it
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
that
you
have
never
heard
him
mentioned
in
madrid
for
he
is
the
son
of
a
famous
caballuco
who
was
in
the
last
rebellion
and
who
was
himself
the
son
of
another
caballuco
who
was
also
in
the
rebellion
of
that
day
and
as
there
is
a
rumor
now
that
there
is
going
to
be
another
insurrection
for
the
whole
country
is
in
a
ferment
we
are
afraid
that
caballuco
will
join
that
also
following
in
the
illustrious
footsteps
of
his
father
and
his
grandfather
who
to
our
glory
be
it
said
were
born
in
our
our
traveller
was
surprised
to
see
the
species
of
that
still
existed
in
the
regions
which
he
had
come
to
visit
but
he
had
no
opportunity
to
put
further
questions
for
the
man
who
was
the
object
of
them
now
joined
them
saying
with
an
expression
of
the
civil
guard
despatched
three
i
have
already
told
the
commander
to
be
careful
what
he
is
about
we
will
speak
to
the
governor
of
the
province
and
i
are
you
going
to
no
but
the
governor
is
coming
here
senor
licurgo
do
you
know
that
they
are
going
to
send
us
a
couple
of
regiments
to
orbajosa
yes
said
the
traveller
quickly
with
a
smile
i
heard
it
said
in
madrid
that
there
was
some
fear
of
a
rising
in
this
place
it
is
well
to
be
prepared
for
what
may
they
talk
nothing
but
nonsense
in
madrid
exclaimed
the
centaur
violently
accompanying
his
affirmation
with
a
string
of
vocables
in
madrid
there
is
nothing
but
rascality
what
do
they
send
us
soldiers
for
to
squeeze
more
contributions
out
of
us
and
a
couple
of
conscriptions
afterward
by
all
that
s
holy
if
there
isn
t
a
rising
there
ought
to
be
so
you
he
ended
looking
banteringly
at
the
young
man
so
you
are
dona
perfecta
s
nephew
this
abrupt
question
and
the
insolent
glance
of
the
bravo
annoyed
the
young
man
yes
senor
at
your
i
am
a
friend
of
the
senora
s
and
i
love
her
as
i
do
the
apple
of
my
eye
said
caballuco
as
you
are
going
to
orbajosa
we
shall
see
each
other
and
without
another
word
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
which
setting
off
at
a
gallop
soon
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
dust
after
half
an
hour
s
ride
during
which
neither
senor
don
jose
nor
senor
licurgo
manifested
much
disposition
to
talk
the
travellers
came
in
sight
of
an
town
seated
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
from
the
midst
of
whose
closely
clustered
houses
arose
many
dark
towers
and
on
a
height
above
it
the
ruins
of
a
dilapidated
castle
its
base
was
formed
by
a
mass
of
shapeless
walls
of
mud
hovels
gray
and
dusty
looking
as
the
soil
together
with
some
fragments
of
turreted
walls
in
whose
shelter
about
a
thousand
humble
huts
raised
their
miserable
adobe
fronts
like
anaemic
and
hungry
faces
demanding
an
alms
from
the
a
shallow
river
surrounded
the
town
like
a
girdle
of
tin
refreshing
in
its
course
several
gardens
the
only
vegetation
that
cheered
the
eye
people
were
going
into
and
coming
out
of
the
town
on
horseback
and
on
foot
and
the
human
movement
although
not
great
gave
some
appearance
of
life
to
that
great
dwelling
place
whose
architectural
aspect
was
rather
that
of
ruin
and
death
than
of
progress
and
life
the
innumerable
and
beggars
who
dragged
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
road
asking
the
obolus
from
the
presented
a
pitiful
spectacle
it
would
be
impossible
to
see
beings
more
in
harmony
with
or
better
suited
to
the
fissures
of
that
sepulchre
in
which
a
city
was
not
only
buried
but
gone
to
decay
as
our
travellers
approached
the
town
a
discordant
peal
of
bells
gave
token
with
their
expressive
sound
that
that
mummy
had
still
a
soul
it
was
called
orbajosa
a
city
that
figures
not
in
the
chaldean
or
coptic
geography
but
in
that
of
spain
with
inhabitants
a
an
episcopal
seat
a
a
seminary
a
stock
farm
a
high
school
and
other
official
prerogatives
the
bells
are
ringing
for
high
mass
in
the
cathedral
said
uncle
licurgo
we
have
arrived
sooner
than
i
the
appearance
of
your
native
city
said
the
young
man
examining
the
panorama
spread
out
before
him
could
not
be
more
disagreeable
the
historic
city
of
orbajosa
whose
name
is
no
doubt
a
corruption
of
urbs
augusta
looks
like
a
great
all
that
can
be
seen
from
here
is
the
suburbs
said
the
guide
in
an
offended
tone
when
you
enter
the
calle
real
and
the
calle
de
condestable
you
will
see
handsome
buildings
like
the
i
don
t
want
to
speak
ill
of
orbajosa
before
seeing
it
said
the
young
man
and
you
must
not
take
what
i
have
said
as
a
mark
of
contempt
for
whether
humble
and
mean
or
stately
and
handsome
that
city
will
always
be
very
dear
to
me
not
only
is
it
my
mother
s
native
place
but
because
there
are
persons
living
in
it
whom
i
love
without
seeing
them
let
us
enter
the
august
city
they
were
now
ascending
a
road
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
passing
close
to
the
walls
of
the
gardens
do
you
see
that
great
house
at
the
end
of
this
large
garden
whose
wall
we
are
now
passing
said
uncle
licurgo
pointing
to
a
massive
whitewashed
wall
belonging
to
the
only
dwelling
in
view
which
had
the
appearance
of
a
cheerful
and
comfortable
habitation
yes
that
is
my
aunt
s
house
exactly
so
what
we
are
looking
at
is
the
rear
of
the
house
the
front
faces
the
calle
del
condestable
and
it
has
five
iron
balconies
that
look
like
five
castles
the
fine
garden
behind
the
wall
belongs
to
the
house
and
if
you
rise
up
in
your
stirrups
you
will
be
able
to
see
it
all
from
why
we
are
at
the
house
then
cried
the
young
man
can
we
not
enter
from
here
there
is
a
little
door
but
the
senora
had
it
the
young
man
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
and
stretching
his
neck
as
far
as
he
could
looked
over
the
wall
i
can
see
the
whole
of
the
garden
he
said
there
under
the
trees
there
is
a
woman
a
girl
a
young
that
is
senorita
rosario
answered
licurgo
and
at
the
same
time
he
also
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
to
look
over
the
wall
eh
senorita
rosario
he
cried
making
energetic
signs
with
his
right
hand
here
we
are
i
have
brought
your
cousin
with
she
has
seen
us
said
the
young
man
stretching
out
his
neck
as
far
as
was
possible
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
there
is
an
ecclesiastic
with
her
a
that
is
the
penitentiary
answered
the
countryman
with
naturalness
my
cousin
has
seen
us
she
has
left
the
priest
and
is
running
toward
the
house
she
is
as
the
sun
she
has
turned
redder
than
a
cherry

chapter
iii
pepe
rey
before
proceeding
further
it
will
be
well
to
tell
who
pepe
rey
was
and
what
were
the
affairs
which
had
brought
him
to
orbajosa
when
brigadier
rey
died
in
his
two
children
juan
and
perfecta
had
just
married
the
latter
the
richest
of
orbajosa
the
former
a
young
girl
of
the
same
city
the
husband
of
perfecta
was
called
don
manuel
maria
jose
de
polentinos
and
the
wife
of
juan
maria
polentinos
but
although
they
had
the
same
surname
their
relationship
was
somewhat
distant
and
not
very
easy
to
make
out
juan
rey
was
a
distinguished
jurisconsult
who
had
been
graduated
in
seville
and
had
practised
law
in
that
city
for
thirty
years
with
no
less
honor
than
profit
in
he
was
left
a
widower
with
a
son
who
was
old
enough
to
play
mischievous
pranks
he
would
sometimes
amuse
himself
by
constructing
viaducts
mounds
ponds
dikes
and
trenches
of
earth
in
the
yard
of
the
house
and
then
flooding
those
fragile
works
with
water
his
father
let
him
do
so
saying
you
will
be
an
perfecta
and
juan
had
ceased
to
see
each
other
from
the
time
of
their
marriage
because
the
sister
had
gone
to
madrid
with
her
husband
the
wealthy
polentinos
who
was
as
rich
as
he
was
extravagant
play
and
women
had
so
completely
enslaved
manuel
maria
jose
that
he
would
have
dissipated
all
his
fortune
if
death
had
not
been
beforehand
with
him
and
carried
him
off
before
he
had
had
time
to
squander
it
in
a
night
of
orgy
the
life
of
the
rich
provincial
who
had
been
sucked
so
voraciously
by
the
leeches
of
the
capital
and
the
insatiable
vampire
of
play
came
to
a
sudden
termination
his
sole
heir
was
a
daughter
a
few
months
old
with
the
death
of
perfecta
s
husband
the
terrors
of
the
family
were
at
an
end
but
the
great
struggle
began
the
house
of
polentinos
was
ruined
the
estates
were
in
danger
of
being
seized
by
the
all
was
in
confusion
enormous
debts
lamentable
management
in
orbajosa
discredit
and
ruin
in
madrid
perfecta
sent
for
her
brother
who
coming
to
the
distressed
widow
s
assistance
displayed
so
much
diligence
and
skill
that
in
a
short
time
the
greater
part
of
the
dangers
that
threatened
her
had
disappeared
he
began
by
obliging
his
sister
to
live
in
orbajosa
managing
herself
her
vast
estates
while
he
faced
the
formidable
pressure
of
the
creditors
in
madrid
little
by
little
the
house
freed
itself
from
the
enormous
burden
of
its
debts
for
the
excellent
don
juan
rey
who
had
the
best
way
in
the
world
for
managing
such
matters
pleaded
in
the
court
made
settlements
with
the
principal
creditors
and
arranged
to
pay
them
by
instalments
the
result
of
this
skilful
management
being
that
the
rich
patrimony
of
polentinos
was
saved
from
ruin
and
might
continue
for
many
years
to
come
to
bestow
splendor
and
glory
on
that
illustrious
family
perfecta
s
gratitude
was
so
profound
that
in
writing
to
her
brother
from
orbajosa
where
she
determined
to
reside
until
her
daughter
should
be
grown
up
she
said
to
him
among
other
affectionate
things
you
have
been
more
than
a
brother
to
me
more
than
a
father
to
my
daughter
how
can
either
of
us
ever
repay
you
for
services
so
great
ah
my
dear
brother
from
the
moment
in
which
my
daughter
can
reason
and
pronounce
a
name
i
will
teach
her
to
bless
yours
my
gratitude
will
end
only
with
my
life
your
unworthy
sister
regrets
only
that
she
can
find
no
opportunity
of
showing
you
how
much
she
loves
you
and
of
recompensing
you
in
a
manner
suited
to
the
greatness
of
your
soul
and
the
boundless
goodness
of
your
at
the
same
time
when
these
words
were
written
rosarito
was
two
years
old
pepe
rey
shut
up
in
a
school
in
seville
was
making
lines
on
paper
occupied
in
proving
that
the
sum
of
all
the
interior
angles
of
any
polygon
is
equal
to
twice
as
many
right
angles
wanting
four
as
the
figure
has
these
vexatious
commonplaces
of
the
school
kept
him
very
busy
year
after

passed
the
boy
grew
up
still
continuing
to
make
lines
at
last
he
made
one
which
is
called
from
tarragona
to
his
first
serious
toy

the
bridge

in
length
over
the
river

during
all
this
time
dona

continued
to
live
in
orbajosa
as
her
brother
never
left
seville
several
years
passed
without
their
seeing
each
other
a
quarterly
letter
as
punctually
written
as
it
was
punctually
answered
kept
in
communication
these
two
hearts
whose
affection
neither
time
nor
distance
could
cool
in
when
don
juan
rey
satisfied
with
having
fulfilled
his
mission
in
society
retired
from
it
and
went
to
live
in
his
fine
house

employed
for
several
years

of
study
his
father
s
fortune
as
large
as
it
is
possible
for
a
fortune
which
has
only
an
honorable
for
its
source
to
be
in
spain
permitted
him
to
free
himself
in
a
short
time
from
the
yoke
of
material
labor
a
man
of
exalted
ideas
and
with
an
ardent
love
for
science
he
found
his
purest
enjoyment
in
the
observation
and
study
of
the
marvels
by
means
of
which
the
genius
of
the
age
furthers
at
the
same
time
the
culture
and
material
comfort
and
the
moral
progress
of
man
on
returning
from
his
tour
his
father
informed
him
that
he
had
an
important
project
to
communicate
to
him
pepe
supposed
that
it
concerned
some
bridge
dockyard
or
at
the
least
the
draining
of
some
marsh
but
don
juan
soon
dispelled
his
error
disclosing
to
him
his
plan
in
the
following
words
this
is
march
and
perfecta
s
quarterly
letter
has
not
failed
to
come
read
it
my
dear
boy
and
if
you
can
agree
to
what
that
holy
and
exemplary
woman
my
dear
sister
says
in
it
you
will
give
me
the
greatest
happiness
i
could
desire
in
my
old
age
if
the
plan
does
not
please
you
reject
it
without
hesitation
for
although
your
refusal
would
grieve
me
there
is
not
in
it
the
shadow
of
constraint
on
my
part
it
would
be
unworthy
of
us
both
that
it
should
be
realized
through
the
coercion
of
an
obstinate
father
you
are
free
either
to
accept
or
to
reject
it
and
if
there
is
in
your
mind
the
slightest
repugnance
to
it
arising
either
from
your
inclinations
or
from
any
other
cause
i
do
not
wish
you
to
do
violence
to
your
feelings
on
my
pepe
laid
the
letter
on
the
table
after
he
had
glanced
through
it
and
said
quietly
my
aunt
wishes
me
to
marry
rosario
she
writes
accepting
joyfully
my
idea
said
his
father
with
emotion
for
the
idea
was
mine
yes
it
is
a
long
time
a
very
long
time
since
it
occurred
to
me
but
i
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
to
you
until
i
knew
what
your
sister
might
think
about
it
as
you
see
perfecta
receives
my
plan
with
joy
she
says
that
she
too
had
thought
of
it
but
that
she
did
not
venture
to
mention
it
to
me
because
you
are
you
have
seen
what
she
says
because
you
are
a
young
man
of
very
exceptional
merit
and
her
daughter
is
a
country
girl
without
either
a
brilliant
education
or
worldly
attractions
those
are
her
words
my
poor
sister
how
good
she
is
i
see
that
you
are
not
displeased
i
see
that
this
project
of
mine
resembling
a
little
the
officious
prevision
of
the
fathers
of
former
times
who
married
their
children
without
consulting
their
wishes
in
the
matter
and
making
generally
inconsiderate
and
unwise
matches
does
not
seem
absurd
to
you
god
grant
that
this
may
be
as
it
seems
to
promise
one
of
the
happiest
it
is
true
that
you
have
never
seen
your
cousin
but
we
are
both
aware
of
her
virtue
of
her
discretion
of
her
modest
and
noble
simplicity
that
nothing
may
be
wanting
she
is
even
beautiful
my
opinion
is
he
added
gayly
that
you
should
at
once
start
for
that
episcopal
city
that
urbs
augusta
and
there
in
the
presence
of
my
sister
and
her
charming
rosarito
decide
whether
the
latter
is
to
be
something
more
to
me
or
not
than
my
pepe
took
up
the
letter
again
and
read
it
through
carefully
his
countenance
expressed
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
he
might
have
been
examining
some
plan
for
the
junction
of
two
railroads
in
truth
said
don
juan
in
that
remote
orbajosa
where
by
the
way
you
have
some
land
that
you
might
take
a
look
at
now
life
passes
with
the
tranquillity
and
the
sweetness
of
an
idyl
what
patriarchal
customs
what
noble
simplicity
what
rural
and
virgilian
peace
if
instead
of
being
a
mathematician
you
were
a
latinist
you
would
repeat
as
you
enter
it
the
tua
rura
what
an
admirable
place
in
which
to
commune
with
one
s
own
soul
and
to
prepare
one
s
self
for
good
works
there
all
is
kindness
and
goodness
there
the
deceit
and
hypocrisy
of
our
great
cities
are
unknown
there
the
holy
inclinations
which
the
turmoil
of
modern
life
stifles
spring
into
being
again
there
dormant
faith
reawakens
and
one
feels
within
the
breast
an
impulse
vague
but
keen
like
the
impatience
of
youth
that
from
the
depths
of
the
soul
cries
out
i
wish
to
live
a
few
days
after
this
conference
pepe
left
puerto
real
he
had
refused
some
months
before
a
commission
from
the
government
to
survey
in
its
mineralogical
aspects
the
basin
of
the
river
nahara
in
the
valley
of
orbajosa
but
the
plans
to
which
the
conference
above
recorded
gave
rise
caused
him
to
say
to
himself
it
will
be
as
well
to
make
use
of
the
time
heaven
only
knows
how
long
this
courtship
may
last
or
what
hours
of
weariness
it
may
bring
with
he
went
then
to
madrid
solicited
the
commission
to
explore
the
basin
of
the
nahara
which
he
obtained
without
difficulty
although
he
did
not
belong
officially
to
the
mining
corps
set
out
shortly
afterward
and
after
a
second
change
of
trains
the
mixed
train
no
bore
him
as
we
have
seen
to
the
loving
arms
of
uncle
licurgo
the
age
of
our
hero
was
about
years
he
was
of
a
robust
constitution
of
athletic
build
and
so
admirably
proportioned
and
of
so
commanding
an
appearance
that
if
he
had
worn
a
uniform
he
would
have
presented
the
most
martial
air
and
figure
that
it
is
possible
to
imagine
his
hair
and
beard
were
blond
in
color
but
in
his
countenance
there
was
none
of
the
phlegmatic
imperturbability
of
the
saxon
but
on
the
contrary
so
much
animation
that
his
eyes
although
they
were
not
black
seemed
to
be
so
his
figure
would
have
served
as
a
perfect
and
beautiful
model
for
a
statue
on
the
pedestal
of
which
the
sculptor
might
engrave
the
words
intellect
if
not
in
visible
characters
he
bore
them
vaguely
expressed
in
the
brilliancy
of
his
glance
in
the
potent
attraction
with
which
his
person
was
peculiarly
endowed
and
in
the
sympathy
which
his
cordial
manners
inspired
he
was
not
very
talkative
only
persons
of
inconstant
ideas
and
unstable
judgment
are
prone
to
verbosity
his
profound
moral
sense
made
him
sparing
of
words
in
the
disputes
in
which
the
men
of
the
day
are
prone
to
engage
on
any
and
every
subject
but
in
polite
conversation
he
displayed
an
eloquence
full
of
wit
and
intelligence
emanating
always
from
good
sense
and
a
temperate
and
just
appreciation
of
worldly
matters
he
had
no
toleration
for
those
sophistries
and
mystifications
and
quibbles
of
the
understanding
with
which
persons
of
intelligence
imbued
with
affected
culture
sometimes
amuse
themselves
and
in
defence
of
the
truth
pepe
rey
employed
at
times
and
not
always
with
moderation
the
weapon
of
ridicule
this
was
almost
a
defect
in
the
eyes
of
many
people
who
esteemed
him
for
our
hero
thus
appeared
wanting
in
respect
for
a
multitude
of
things
commonly
accepted
and
believed
it
must
be
acknowledged
although
it
may
lessen
him
in
the
opinion
of
many
that
rey
did
not
share
the
mild
toleration
of
the
compliant
age
which
has
invented
strange
disguises
of
words
and
of
acts
to
conceal
what
to
the
general
eye
might
be
disagreeable
such
was
the
man
whatever
slanderous
tongues
may
say
to
the
contrary
whom
uncle
licurgo
introduced
into
orbajosa
just
as
the
cathedral
bells
were
ringing
for
high
mass
when
looking
over
the
garden
wall
they
saw
the
young
girl
and
the
penitentiary
and
then
the
flight
of
the
former
toward
the
house
they
put
spurs
to
their
beasts
and
entered
the
calle
real
where
a
great
many
idlers
stood
still
to
gaze
at
the
traveller
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
and
an
intruder
in
the
patriarchal
city
turning
presently
to
the
right
and
riding
in
the
direction
of
the
cathedral
whose
massive
bulk
dominated
the
town
they
entered
the
calle
del
condestable
in
which
being
narrow
and
paved
the
hoofs
of
the
animals
clattered
noisily
alarming
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
who
came
to
the
windows
and
to
the
balconies
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
shutters
opened
with
a
grating
sound
and
various
faces
almost
all
feminine
appeared
above
and
below
by
the
time
pepe
rey
had
reached
the
threshold
of
the
house
of
polentinos
many
and
diverse
comments
had
been
already
made
on
his
person
chapter
iv
the
arrival
of
the
cousin
when
rosarito
left
him
so
abruptly
the
penitentiary
looked
toward
the
garden
wall
and
seeing
the
faces
of
licurgo
and
his
companion
said
to
himself
so
the
prodigy
is
already
here
he
remained
thoughtful
for
some
moments
his
cloak
grasped
with
both
hands
folded
over
his
abdomen
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
his
spectacles
slipping
gently
toward
the
point
of
his
nose
his
moist
and
projecting
and
his
eyebrows
gathered
in
a
slight
frown
he
was
a
pious
and
holy
man
of
uncommon
learning
and
of
irreproachable
clerical
habits
a
little
past
his
sixtieth
year
affable
in
his
manners
courteous
and
kind
and
greatly
addicted
to
giving
advice
and
counsel
to
both
men
and
women
for
many
years
past
he
had
been
master
of
latin
and
rhetoric
in
the
institute
which
noble
profession
had
supplied
him
with
a
large
fund
of
quotations
from
horace
and
of
florid
metaphors
which
he
employed
with
wit
and
opportuneness
nothing
more
need
be
said
regarding
this
personage
but
that
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
trot
of
the
animals
approaching
the
calle
del
condestable
he
arranged
the
folds
of
his
cloak
straightened
his
hat
which
was
not
altogether
correctly
placed
upon
his
venerable
head
and
walking
toward
the
house
murmured
let
us
go
and
see
this
meanwhile
pepe
was
alighting
from
his
nag
and
dona
perfecta
her
face
bathed
in
tears
and
barely
able
to
utter
a
few
trembling
words
the
sincere
expression
of
her
affection
was
receiving
him
at
the
gate
itself
in
her
loving
arms
pepe
but
how
tall
you
are
and
with
a
beard
why
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
held
you
in
my
lap
and
now
you
are
a
man
a
man
well
well
how
the
years
pass
this
is
my
daughter
as
she
said
this
they
reached
the
parlor
on
the
ground
floor
which
was
generally
used
as
a
and
dona
perfecta
presented
her
daughter
to
pepe
rosario
was
a
girl
of
delicate
and
fragile
appearance
that
revealed
a
tendency
to
pensive
melancholy
in
her
delicate
and
pure
countenance
there
was
something
of
the
soft
pearly
pallor
which
most
novelists
attribute
to
their
heroines
and
without
which
sentimental
varnish
it
appears
that
no
enriquieta
or
julia
can
be
interesting
but
what
chiefly
distinguished
rosario
was
that
her
face
expressed
so
much
sweetness
and
modesty
that
the
absence
of
the
perfections
it
lacked
was
not
observed
this
is
not
to
say
that
she
was
plain
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
true
that
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
call
her
beautiful
in
the
strictest
meaning
of
the
word
the
real
beauty
of
dona
perfecta
s
daughter
consisted
in
a
species
of
transparency
different
from
that
of
pearl
alabaster
marble
or
any
of
the
other
substances
used
in
descriptions
of
the
human
countenance
a
species
of
transparency
through
which
the
inmost
depths
of
her
soul
were
clearly
visible
depths
not
cavernous
and
gloomy
like
those
of
the
sea
but
like
those
of
a
clear
and
placid
river
but
the
material
was
wanting
there
for
a
complete
personality
the
channel
was
wanting
the
banks
were
wanting
the
vast
wealth
of
her
spirit
overflowed
threatening
to
wash
away
the
narrow
borders
when
her
cousin
saluted
her
she
blushed
crimson
and
uttered
only
a
few
unintelligible
words
you
must
be
fainting
with
hunger
said
dona
perfecta
to
her
nephew
you
shall
have
your
breakfast
at
with
your
permission
responded
the
traveller
i
will
first
go
and
get
rid
of
the
dust
of
the
that
is
a
sensible
idea
said
the
senora
rosario
take
your
cousin
to
the
room
that
we
have
prepared
for
him
don
t
delay
nephew
i
am
going
to
give
the
necessary
rosario
took
her
cousin
to
a
handsome
apartment
situated
on
the
ground
floor
the
moment
he
entered
it
pepe
recognized
in
all
the
details
of
the
room
the
diligent
and
loving
hand
of
a
woman
all
was
arranged
with
perfect
taste
and
the
purity
and
freshness
of
everything
in
this
charming
nest
invited
to
repose
the
guest
observed
minute
details
that
made
him
smile
here
is
the
bell
said
rosario
taking
in
her
hand
the
the
tassel
of
which
hung
over
the
head
of
the
bed
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
stretch
out
your
hand
the
is
placed
so
that
you
will
have
the
light
from
the
left
see
in
this
basket
you
can
throw
the
waste
papers
do
you
smoke
unfortunately
yes
responded
pepe
rey
well
then
you
can
throw
the
ends
of
your
cigars
here
she
said
touching
with
the
tip
of
her
shoe
a
utensil
of
filled
with
sand
there
is
nothing
uglier
than
to
see
the
floor
covered
with
here
is
the
washstand
for
your
clothes
you
have
a
wardrobe
and
a
bureau
i
think
this
is
a
bad
place
for
the
it
would
be
better
beside
the
bed
if
the
light
annoys
you
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
lower
the
shade
with
this
cord
see
this
the
engineer
was
enchanted
rosarito
opened
one
of
the
windows
look
she
said
this
window
opens
into
the
garden
the
sun
comes
in
here
in
the
afternoon
here
we
have
hung
the
cage
of
a
canary
that
sings
as
if
he
was
crazy
if
his
singing
disturbs
you
we
will
take
it
she
opened
another
window
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
this
other
window
she
continued
looks
out
on
the
street
look
from
here
you
can
see
the
cathedral
it
is
very
handsome
and
full
of
beautiful
things
a
great
many
english
people
come
to
see
it
don
t
open
both
windows
at
the
same
time
because
draughts
are
very
my
dear
cousin
said
pepe
his
soul
inundated
with
an
inexplicable
joy
in
all
that
is
before
my
eyes
i
see
an
angel
s
hand
that
can
be
only
yours
what
a
beautiful
room
this
is
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
lived
in
it
all
my
life
it
invites
to
rosarito
made
no
answer
to
these
affectionate
expressions
and
left
the
room
smiling
make
no
delay
she
said
from
the
door
the
too
is
down
stairs
in
the
centre
of
this
uncle
licurgo
came
in
with
the
luggage
pepe
rewarded
him
with
a
liberality
to
which
the
countryman
was
not
accustomed
and
the
latter
after
humbly
thanking
the
engineer
raised
his
hand
to
his
head
with
a
hesitating
movement
and
in
an
embarrassed
tone
and
mumbling
his
words
he
said
hesitatingly
when
will
it
be
most
convenient
for
me
to
speak
to
senor
don
jose
about
a
a
little
matter
of
business
a
little
matter
of
business
at
once
responded
pepe
opening
one
of
his
trunks
this
is
not
a
suitable
time
said
the
countryman
when
senor
don
jose
has
rested
it
will
be
time
enough
there
are
more
days
than
sausages
as
the
saying
is
and
after
one
day
comes
another
rest
now
senor
don
jose
whenever
you
want
to
take
a
ride
the
nag
is
not
bad
well
senor
don
jose
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
ah
i
had
forgotten
he
added
returning
a
few
moments
later
if
you
have
any
message
for
the
municipal
judge
i
am
going
now
to
speak
to
him
about
our
little
give
him
my
compliments
said
pepe
gayly
no
better
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
spartan
legislator
occurring
to
him
then
senor
don
the
engineer
had
not
yet
taken
his
clothes
out
of
the
trunk
when
for
the
third
time
the
shrewd
eyes
and
the
crafty
face
of
uncle
licurgo
appeared
in
the
i
beg
your
pardon
senor
don
jose
he
said
displaying
his
brilliantly
white
teeth
in
an
affected
smile
but
i
wanted
to
say
that
if
you
wish
to
settle
the
matter
by
means
of
friendly
arbitrations
although
as
the
saying
is
ask
other
people
s
opinion
of
something
that
concerns
only
yourself
and
some
will
say
it
is
white
and
others
will
you
get
away
from
here
man
i
say
that
because
i
hate
the
law
i
don
t
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
law
well
again
senor
don
jose
god
give
you
long
life
to
help
the
poor
man
pepe
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
saying
to
himself
the
people
of
this
town
appear
to
be
very
chapter
v
will
there
be
dissension
a
little
later
pepe
made
his
appearance
in
the
if
you
eat
a
hearty
breakfast
said
dona
perfecta
to
him
in
affectionate
accents
you
will
have
no
appetite
for
dinner
we
dine
here
at
one
perhaps
you
may
not
like
the
customs
of
the
i
am
enchanted
with
them
say
then
which
you
prefer
to
eat
a
hearty
breakfast
now
or
to
take
something
light
and
keep
your
appetite
for
i
prefer
to
take
something
light
now
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
you
but
not
even
if
i
had
found
anything
to
eat
in
villahorrenda
would
i
have
eaten
any
thing
at
this
early
of
course
i
need
not
tell
you
that
you
are
to
treat
us
with
perfect
frankness
you
may
give
your
orders
here
as
if
you
were
in
your
own
thanks
but
how
like
your
father
you
are
said
the
senora
regarding
the
young
man
as
he
ate
with
real
delight
i
can
fancy
i
am
looking
now
at
my
dear
brother
juan
he
sat
just
as
you
are
sitting
and
ate
as
you
are
eating
in
your
expression
especially
you
are
as
like
as
two
drops
of
pepe
began
his
frugal
breakfast
the
words
as
well
as
the
manner
and
the
expression
of
his
aunt
and
cousin
inspired
him
with
so
much
confidence
that
he
already
felt
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
house
do
you
know
what
rosario
was
saying
to
me
this
morning
said
dona
perfecta
looking
at
her
nephew
well
she
was
saying
that
as
a
man
accustomed
to
the
luxuries
and
the
etiquette
of
the
capital
and
to
foreign
ways
you
would
not
be
able
to
put
up
with
the
somewhat
rustic
simplicity
and
the
lack
of
ceremony
of
our
manner
of
life
for
here
every
thing
is
very
what
a
mistake
responded
pepe
looking
at
his
cousin
no
one
abhors
more
than
i
do
the
falseness
and
the
hypocrisy
of
what
is
called
high
society
believe
me
i
have
long
wished
to
give
myself
a
complete
bath
in
nature
as
some
one
has
said
to
live
far
from
the
turmoil
of
existence
in
the
solitude
and
quiet
of
the
country
i
long
for
the
tranquillity
of
a
life
without
strife
without
anxieties
neither
envying
nor
envied
as
the
poet
has
said
for
a
long
time
my
studies
at
first
and
my
work
afterward
prevented
me
from
taking
the
rest
which
i
need
and
which
my
mind
and
my
body
both
require
but
ever
since
i
entered
this
house
my
dear
aunt
my
dear
cousin
i
have
felt
myself
surrounded
by
the
peaceful
atmosphere
which
i
have
longed
for
you
must
not
talk
to
me
then
of
society
either
high
or
low
or
of
the
world
either
great
or
small
for
i
would
willingly
exchange
them
all
for
this
peaceful
while
he
was
thus
speaking
the
glass
door
which
led
from
the
into
the
garden
was
obscured
by
the
interposition
between
it
and
the
light
of
a
dark
body
the
glasses
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
catching
a
sunbeam
sent
forth
a
fugitive
gleam
the
latch
creaked
the
door
opened
and
the
penitentiary
gravely
entered
the
room
he
saluted
those
present
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
until
its
brim
touched
the
floor
it
is
the
senor
penitentiary
of
our
holy
cathedral
said
dona
perfecta
a
person
whom
we
all
esteem
greatly
and
whose
friend
you
will
i
hope
be
take
a
seat
senor
don
pepe
shook
hands
with
the
venerable
canon
and
both
sat
down
if
you
are
accustomed
to
smoke
after
meals
pray
do
so
said
dona
perfecta
amiably
and
the
senor
penitentiary
the
worthy
don
inocencio
drew
from
under
his
cassock
a
large
leather
which
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
long
use
opened
it
and
took
from
it
two
long
cigarettes
one
of
which
he
offered
to
our
friend
rosario
took
a
match
from
a
little
matchbox
which
the
spaniards
ironically
call
a
wagon
and
the
engineer
and
the
canon
were
soon
puffing
their
smoke
over
each
other
and
what
does
senor
don
jose
think
of
our
dear
city
of
orbajosa
asked
the
canon
shutting
his
left
eye
tightly
according
to
his
habit
when
he
smoked
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the
town
said
pepe
from
the
little
i
have
seen
of
it
however
i
think
that
half
a
dozen
large
capitalists
disposed
to
invest
their
money
here
a
pair
of
intelligent
heads
to
direct
the
work
of
renovating
the
place
and
a
couple
of
thousands
of
active
hands
to
carry
it
out
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
orbajosa
coming
from
the
entrance
to
the
town
to
the
door
of
this
house
i
saw
more
than
a
hundred
beggars
the
greater
part
of
them
are
healthy
and
even
robust
men
it
is
a
pitiable
army
the
sight
of
which
oppresses
the
that
is
what
charity
is
for
declared
don
inocencio
apart
from
that
orbajosa
is
not
a
poor
town
you
are
already
aware
that
the
best
garlic
in
all
spain
is
produced
here
there
are
more
than
twenty
rich
families
living
among
it
is
true
said
dona
perfecta
that
the
last
few
years
have
been
wretched
owing
to
the
drought
but
even
so
the
granaries
are
not
empty
and
several
thousands
of
strings
of
garlic
were
recently
carried
to
during
the
many
years
that
i
have
lived
in
orbajosa
said
the
priest
with
a
frown
i
have
seen
innumerable
persons
come
here
from
the
capital
some
brought
by
the
electoral
others
to
visit
some
abandoned
site
or
to
see
the
antiquities
of
the
cathedral
and
they
all
talk
to
us
about
the
english
ploughs
and
and
and
banks
and
i
don
t
know
how
many
other
absurdities
the
burden
of
their
song
is
that
this
place
is
very
backward
and
that
it
could
be
improved
let
them
keep
away
from
us
in
the
devil
s
name
we
are
well
enough
as
we
are
without
the
gentlemen
from
the
capital
visiting
us
a
great
deal
better
off
without
hearing
that
continual
clamor
about
our
poverty
and
the
grandeurs
and
the
wonders
of
other
places
the
fool
in
his
own
house
is
wiser
than
the
wise
man
in
another
s
is
it
not
so
senor
don
jose
of
course
you
mustn
t
imagine
even
remotely
that
i
say
this
on
your
account
not
at
all
of
course
not
i
know
that
we
have
before
us
one
of
the
most
eminent
young
men
of
modern
spain
a
man
who
would
be
able
to
transform
into
fertile
lands
our
arid
wastes
and
i
am
not
at
all
angry
because
you
sing
us
the
same
old
song
about
the
english
ploughs
and
arboriculture
and
silviculture
not
in
the
least
men
of
such
great
such
very
great
merit
may
be
excused
for
the
contempt
which
they
manifest
for
our
littleness
no
no
my
friend
no
no
senor
don
jose
you
are
entitled
to
say
any
thing
you
please
even
to
tell
us
that
we
are
not
much
better
than
this
philippic
concluded
in
a
marked
tone
of
irony
and
all
of
it
impertinent
enough
did
not
please
the
young
man
but
he
refrained
from
manifesting
the
slightest
annoyance
and
continued
the
conversation
endeavoring
to
avoid
as
far
as
possible
the
subjects
in
which
the
patriotism
of
the
canon
might
find
cause
of
offence
the
latter
rose
when
dona
perfecta
began
to
speak
to
her
nephew
about
family
matters
and
took
a
few
turns
about
the
room
this
was
a
spacious
and
apartment
the
walls
of
which
were
covered
with
an
paper
whose
flowers
and
branches
although
faded
preserved
their
original
pattern
thanks
to
the
cleanliness
which
reigned
in
each
and
every
part
of
the
dwelling
the
clock
from
the
case
of
which
hung
uncovered
the
apparently
motionless
weights
and
the
voluble
pendulum
perpetually
repeating
no
no
occupied
with
its
variegated
dial
the
most
prominent
place
among
the
solid
pieces
of
furniture
of
the
the
adornment
of
the
walls
being
completed
by
a
series
of
french
engravings
representing
the
exploits
of
the
conqueror
of
mexico
with
prolix
explanations
at
the
foot
of
each
concerning
a
ferdinand
cortez
and
a
donna
marine
as
little
true
to
nature
as
were
the
figures
delineated
by
the
ignorant
artist
in
the
space
between
the
two
glass
doors
which
communicated
with
the
garden
was
an
apparatus
of
brass
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
describe
further
than
to
say
that
it
served
to
support
a
parrot
which
maintained
itself
on
it
with
the
air
of
gravity
and
circumspection
peculiar
to
those
animals
taking
note
of
everything
that
went
on
the
hard
and
ironical
expression
of
the
parrot
tribe
their
green
coats
their
red
caps
their
yellow
boots
and
finally
the
hoarse
mocking
words
which
they
generally
utter
give
them
a
strange
and
repulsive
aspect
half
serious
there
is
in
their
air
an
indescribable
something
of
the
stiffness
of
diplomats
at
times
they
remind
one
of
buffoons
and
they
always
resemble
those
absurdly
conceited
people
who
in
their
desire
to
appear
very
superior
look
like
caricatures
the
penitentiary
was
very
fond
of
the
parrot
when
he
left
dona
perfecta
and
rosario
conversing
with
the
traveller
he
went
over
to
the
bird
and
allowing
it
to
bite
his
forefinger
with
the
greatest
good
humor
said
to
it
rascal
knave
why
don
t
you
talk
you
would
be
of
little
account
if
you
weren
t
a
prater
the
world
of
birds
as
well
as
men
is
full
of
then
with
his
own
venerable
hand
he
took
some
peas
from
the
dish
beside
him
and
gave
them
to
the
bird
to
eat
the
parrot
began
to
call
to
the
maid
asking
her
for
some
chocolate
and
its
words
diverted
the
two
ladies
and
the
young
man
from
a
conversation
which
could
not
have
been
very
engrossing
chapter
vi
in
which
it
is
seen
that
disagreement
may
arise
when
least
expected
suddenly
don
cayetano
polentinos
dona
perfecta
s
appeared
at
the
door
and
entering
the
room
with
outstretched
arms
cried
let
me
embrace
you
my
dear
don
they
embraced
each
other
cordially
don
cayetano
and
pepe
were
already
acquainted
with
each
other
for
the
eminent
scholar
and
bibliophile
was
in
the
habit
of
making
a
trip
to
madrid
whenever
an
executor
s
sale
of
the
stock
of
some
dealer
in
old
books
was
advertised
don
cayetano
was
tall
and
thin
of
middle
age
although
constant
study
or
had
given
him
a
worn
appearance
he
expressed
himself
with
a
refined
correctness
which
became
him
admirably
and
he
was
affectionate
and
amiable
in
his
manners
at
times
to
excess
with
respect
to
his
vast
learning
what
can
be
said
but
that
he
was
a
real
prodigy
in
madrid
his
name
was
always
mentioned
with
respect
and
if
don
cayetano
had
lived
in
the
capital
he
could
not
have
escaped
becoming
a
member
in
spite
of
his
modesty
of
every
academy
in
it
past
present
and
to
come
but
he
was
fond
of
quiet
and
retirement
and
the
place
which
vanity
occupies
in
the
souls
of
others
a
pure
passion
for
books
a
love
of
solitary
and
secluded
study
without
any
other
aim
or
incentive
than
the
books
and
the
study
themselves
occupied
in
his
he
had
formed
in
orbajosa
one
of
the
finest
libraries
that
is
to
be
found
in
all
spain
and
among
his
books
he
passed
long
hours
of
the
day
and
of
the
night
compiling
classifying
taking
notes
and
selecting
various
sorts
of
precious
information
or
composing
perhaps
some
hitherto
and
work
worthy
of
so
great
a
mind
his
habits
were
patriarchal
he
ate
little
drank
less
and
his
only
dissipations
consisted
of
a
luncheon
in
the
alamillos
on
very
great
occasions
and
daily
walks
to
a
place
called
mundogrande
where
were
often
disinterred
from
the
accumulated
dust
of
twenty
centuries
medals
bits
of
architecture
and
occasionally
an
amphora
or
cubicularia
of
inestimable
value
don
cayetano
and
dona
perfecta
lived
in
such
perfect
harmony
that
the
peace
of
paradise
was
not
to
be
compared
to
it
they
never
disagreed
it
is
true
that
don
cayetano
never
interfered
in
the
affairs
of
the
house
nor
dona
perfecta
in
those
of
the
library
except
to
have
it
swept
and
dusted
every
saturday
regarding
with
religious
respect
the
books
and
papers
that
were
in
use
on
the
table
or
anywhere
else
in
the
room
after
the
questions
and
answers
proper
to
the
occasion
had
been
interchanged
don
cayetano
said
i
have
already
looked
at
the
books
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
did
not
bring
me
the
edition
of
i
shall
have
to
make
a
journey
to
madrid
myself
are
you
going
to
remain
with
us
long
the
longer
the
better
my
dear
pepe
how
glad
i
am
to
have
you
here
between
us
both
we
will
arrange
a
part
of
my
library
and
make
an
index
of
the
writers
on
the
art
of
horsemanship
it
is
not
always
one
has
at
hand
a
man
of
your
talents
you
shall
see
my
library
you
can
take
your
fill
of
reading
there
as
often
as
you
like
you
will
see
marvels
real
marvels
inestimable
treasures
rare
works
that
no
one
but
myself
has
a
copy
of
but
i
think
it
must
be
time
for
dinner
is
it
not
jose
is
it
not
perfecta
is
it
not
rosarito
is
it
not
senor
don
inocencio
you
are
doubly
a
penitentiary
i
mean
because
you
will
accompany
us
in
doing
the
canon
bowed
and
smiled
manifesting
his
pleased
acquiescence
the
dinner
was
substantial
and
in
all
the
dishes
there
was
noticeable
the
excessive
abundance
of
country
banquets
realized
at
the
expense
of
variety
there
was
enough
to
surfeit
twice
as
many
persons
as
sat
down
to
table
the
conversation
turned
on
various
subjects
you
must
visit
our
cathedral
as
soon
as
possible
said
the
canon
there
are
few
cathedrals
like
ours
senor
don
jose
but
of
course
you
who
have
seen
so
many
wonders
in
foreign
countries
will
find
nothing
remarkable
in
our
old
church
we
poor
provincials
of
orbajosa
however
think
it
divine
master
lopez
of
berganza
one
of
the
prebendaries
of
the
cathedral
called
it
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
perhaps
for
a
man
of
your
learning
it
would
possess
no
merit
and
some
market
constructed
of
iron
would
seem
more
the
ironical
remarks
of
the
wily
canon
annoyed
pepe
rey
more
and
more
every
moment
but
determined
to
control
himself
and
to
conceal
his
anger
he
answered
only
with
vague
words
dona
perfecta
then
took
up
the
theme
and
said
playfully
take
care
pepito
i
warn
you
that
if
you
speak
ill
of
our
holy
church
we
shall
cease
to
be
friends
you
know
a
great
deal
you
are
a
man
eminent
for
your
knowledge
on
every
subject
but
if
you
are
going
to
discover
that
that
grand
edifice
is
not
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
you
will
do
well
to
keep
your
knowledge
to
yourself
and
leave
us
in
our
far
from
thinking
that
the
building
is
not
handsome
responded
pepe
the
little
i
have
seen
of
its
exterior
has
seemed
to
me
of
imposing
beauty
so
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
be
alarmed
aunt
and
i
am
very
far
from
being
a
softly
softly
said
the
canon
extending
his
hand
and
giving
his
mouth
a
truce
from
eating
in
order
to
talk
stop
there
don
t
come
now
pretending
modesty
senor
don
jose
we
are
too
well
aware
of
your
great
merit
of
the
high
reputation
you
enjoy
and
the
important
part
you
play
wherever
you
are
for
that
men
like
you
are
not
to
be
met
with
every
day
but
now
that
i
have
extolled
your
merits
in
this
way
he
stopped
to
eat
a
mouthful
and
when
his
tongue
was
once
more
at
liberty
he
continued
thus
now
that
i
have
extolled
your
merits
in
this
way
permit
me
to
express
a
different
opinion
with
the
frankness
which
belongs
to
my
character
yes
senor
don
jose
yes
senor
don
cayetano
yes
senora
and
senorita
science
as
the
moderns
study
and
propagate
it
is
the
death
of
sentiment
and
of
every
sweet
illusion
under
its
influence
the
life
of
the
spirit
declines
every
thing
is
reduced
to
fixed
rules
and
even
the
sublime
charms
of
nature
disappear
science
destroys
the
marvellous
in
the
arts
as
well
as
faith
in
the
soul
science
says
that
every
thing
is
a
lie
and
would
reduce
every
thing
to
figures
and
lines
not
only
ac
where
we
are
but
where
god
is
the
wonderful
visions
of
the
soul
its
mystic
raptures
even
the
inspiration
of
the
poets
are
all
a
lie
the
heart
is
a
sponge
the
brain
a
place
for
breeding
every
one
laughed
while
the
canon
took
a
draught
of
wine
come
now
will
senor
don
jose
deny
continued
the
ecclesiastic
that
science
as
it
is
taught
and
propagated
is
fast
making
of
the
world
and
of
the
human
race
a
great
machine
that
depends
said
don
cayetano
every
thing
has
its
and
its
take
some
more
salad
senor
penitentiary
said
dona
perfecta
it
is
just
as
you
like
it
with
a
good
deal
of
pepe
rey
was
not
fond
of
engaging
in
useless
discussions
he
was
not
a
pedant
nor
did
he
desire
to
make
a
display
of
his
learning
and
still
less
did
he
wish
to
do
so
in
the
presence
of
women
and
in
a
private
but
the
importunate
and
aggressive
verbosity
of
the
canon
required
in
his
opinion
a
corrective
to
flatter
his
vanity
by
agreeing
with
his
views
would
he
thought
be
a
bad
way
to
give
it
to
him
and
he
determined
therefore
to
express
only
such
opinions
as
should
be
most
directly
opposed
to
those
of
the
sarcastic
penitentiary
and
most
offensive
to
him
so
you
wish
to
amuse
yourself
at
my
expense
he
said
to
himself
wait
and
you
will
see
what
a
fine
dance
i
will
lead
then
he
said
aloud
all
that
the
senor
penitentiary
has
said
ironically
is
the
truth
but
it
is
not
our
fault
if
science
overturns
day
after
day
the
vain
idols
of
the
past
its
superstitions
its
sophisms
its
innumerable
fables
beautiful
some
of
them
ridiculous
others
for
in
the
vineyard
of
the
lord
grow
both
good
fruit
and
bad
the
world
of
illusions
which
is
as
we
might
say
a
second
world
is
tumbling
about
us
in
ruins
mysticism
in
religion
routine
in
science
mannerism
in

are
falling
as
the
pagan

fell
amid

farewell
foolish

the

race
is
awakening
and
its
eyes
behold
the
light
its
vain
sentimentalism
its
mysticism
its
fevers
its
hallucination
its
delirium
are
passing
away
and
he
who
was
before
sick
is
now
well

an
ineffable
delight
in
the
just
appreciation
of

the
terrible
madwoman

look
around
you
senor
penitentiary
and
you
will
see
the
admirable
aggregation
of
truths
which
has
taken
the
place
of
fable
the
sky
is
not
a
vault
the
stars
are
not
little
lamps
the
moon
is
not
a
sportive
huntress
but
an
opaque
mass
of
stone
the
sun
is
not
a
gayly
adorned
and
vagabond
charioteer
but
a
fixed
fire
scylla
and
charybdis
are
not
nymphs
but
sunken

when

there

there

there

no

nor

any

there
is
no

than

this

returns
from

declares
that
there
are
no

of
the

there
are
no
other
ascents

than
those
of

declares
that

nothing

fable
whether
it

exists
no

and
imagination
plays
only
a
secondary
part
all
the

are

work
whenever
i
desire
to
do
so
in
my
laboratory
with
my
bunsen

a
conducting
wire
and
a
magnetized
needle
there
are
now
no
other
multiplications
of

than
those
which
industry
makes
with
her
moulds
and
her
machines
and
those
of
the
printing
press
which
imitates
nature
taking
from
a
single
type
millions
of
copies
in
short
my
dear
canon
orders
have
been
given
to
put
on
the
retired
list
all
the
absurdities
lies
illusions
dreams
sentimentalities
and
prejudices
which
darken
the
understanding
of
man
let
us
rejoice
at
the
when
pepe
finished
speaking
a
furtive
smile
played
upon
the
canon
s
lips
and
his
eyes
were
extraordinarily
animated
don
cayetano
busied
himself
in
giving
various
forms
now
rhomboidal
now
prismatic
to
a
little
ball
of
bread
but
dona
perfecta
was
pale
and
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
canon
with
observant
insistence
rosarito
looked
with
amazement
at
her
cousin
the
latter
bending
toward
her
whispered
under
his
breath
don
t
mind
me
little
cousin
i
am
talking
all
this
nonsense
only
to
enrage
the
chapter
vii
the
disagreement
increases
perhaps
you
think
said
dona
perfecta
with
a
tinge
of
conceit
in
her
tones
that
senor
don
inocencio
is
going
to
remain
silent
and
not
give
you
an
answer
to
each
and
every
one
of
those
oh
no
exclaimed
the
canon
arching
his
eyebrows
i
will
not
attempt
to
measure
my
poor
abilities
with
a
champion
so
valiant
and
at
the
same
time
so
well
armed
senor
don
jose
knows
every
thing
that
is
to
say
he
has
at
his
command
the
whole
arsenal
of
the
exact
sciences
of
course
i
know
that
the
doctrines
he
upholds
are
false
but
i
have
neither
the
talent
nor
the
eloquence
to
combat
them
i
would
employ
theological
arguments
drawn
from
revelation
from
faith
from
the
divine
word
but
alas
senor
don
jose
who
is
an
eminent
savant
would
laugh
at
theology
at
faith
at
revelation
at
the
holy
prophets
at
the
gospel
a
poor
ignorant
priest
an
unhappy
man
who
knows
neither
mathematics
nor
german
philosophy
with
its
and
its
a
poor
dominie
who
knows
only
the
science
of
god
and
something
of
the
latin
poets
can
not
enter
into
combat
with
so
valiant
a
pepe
rey
burst
into
a
frank
laugh
i
see
that
senor
don
inocencio
he
said
has
taken
seriously
all
the
nonsense
i
have
been
talking
come
senor
canon
regard
the
whole
matter
as
a
jest
and
let
it
end
there
i
am
quite
sure
that
my
opinions
do
not
in
reality
differ
greatly
from
yours
you
are
a
pious
and
learned
man
it
is
i
who
am
ignorant
if
i
have
allowed
myself
to
speak
in
jest
pardon
me
all
of
you
that
is
my
thanks
responded
the
presbyter
visibly
annoyed
is
that
the
way
you
want
to
get
out
of
it
now
i
am
well
aware
we
are
all
well
aware
that
the
views
you
have
sustained
are
your
own
it
could
not
be
otherwise
you
are
the
man
of
the
age
it
can
not
be
denied
that
you
have
a
wonderful
a
truly
wonderful
intellect
while
you
were
talking
at
the
same
time
that
i
inwardly
deplored
errors
so
great
i
could
not
but
admire
i
will
confess
it
frankly
the
loftiness
of
expression
the
prodigious
fluency
the
surprising
method
of
your
reasoning
the
force
of
your
arguments
what
a
head
senora
dona
perfecta
what
a
head
your
young
nephew
has
when
i
was
in
madrid
and
they
took
me
to
the
atheneum
i
confess
that
i
was
amazed
to
see
the
wonderful
talent
which
god
has
bestowed
on
the
atheists
and
the
senor
don
inocencio
said
dona
perfecta
looking
alternately
at
her
nephew
and
her
friend
i
think
that
in
judging
this
boy
you
are
more
than
benevolent
don
t
get
angry
pepe
or
mind
what
i
say
for
i
am
neither
a
savante
nor
a
philosopher
nor
a
theologian
but
it
seems
to
me
that
senor
don
inocencio
has
just
given
a
proof
of
his
great
modesty
and
christian
charity
in
not
crushing
you
as
he
could
have
done
if
he
had
oh
senora
said
the
ecclesiastic
that
is
the
way
with
him
continued
dona
perfecta
always
pretending
to
know
nothing
and
he
knows
more
than
the
seven
doctors
put
together
ah
senor
don
inocencio
how
well
the
name
you
have
suits
you
but
don
t
affect
an
unseasonable
humility
now
why
my
nephew
has
no
pretensions
all
he
knows
is
what
he
has
been
taught
if
he
has
been
taught
error
what
more
can
he
desire
than
that
you
should
enlighten
him
and
take
him
out
of
the
limbo
of
his
false
doctrines
just
so
i
desire
nothing
more
than
that
the
senor
penitentiary
should
take
me
out
murmured
pepe
comprehending
that
without
intending
it
he
had
got
himself
into
a
labyrinth
i
am
a
poor
priest
whose
only
learning
is
some
knowledge
of
the
ancients
responded
don
inocencio
i
recognize
the
immense
value
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
of
senor
don
jose
s
scientific
knowledge
and
before
so
brilliant
an
oracle
i
prostrate
myself
and
am
so
saying
the
canon
folded
his
hands
across
his
breast
and
bent
his
head
pepe
rey
was
somewhat
disturbed
because
of
the
turn
which
his
mind
had
chosen
to
give
to
an
idle
discussion
jestingly
followed
up
and
in
which
he
had
engaged
only
to
enliven
the
conversation
a
little
he
thought
that
the
most
prudent
course
to
pursue
would
be
to
end
at
once
so
dangerous
a
debate
and
for
this
purpose
he
addressed
a
question
to
senor
don
cayetano
when
the
latter
shaking
off
the
drowsiness
which
had
overcome
him
after
the
dessert
offered
the
guests
the
indispensable
toothpicks
stuck
in
a
china
peacock
with
outspread
tail
yesterday
i
discovered
a
hand
grasping
the
handle
of
an
amphora
on
which
there
are
a
number
of
hieratic
characters
i
will
show
it
to
you
said
don
cayetano
delighted
to
introduce
a
favorite
theme
i
suppose
that
senor
de
rey
is
very
expert
in
archaeological
matters
also
said
the
canon
who
still
implacable
pursued
his
victim
to
his
last
retreat
of
course
said
dona
perfecta
what
is
there
that
these
clever
children
of
our
day
do
not
understand
they
have
all
the
sciences
at
their
fingers
ends
the
universities
and
the
academics
teach
them
every
thing
in
a
twinkling
giving
them
a
patent
of
oh
that
is
unjust
responded
the
canon
observing
the
pained
expression
of
the
engineer
s
countenance
my
aunt
is
right
declared
pepe
at
the
present
day
we
learn
a
little
of
every
thing
and
leave
school
with
the
rudiments
of
various
i
was
saying
continued
the
canon
that
you
are
no
doubt
a
great
i
know
absolutely
nothing
of
that
science
responded
the
young
man
ruins
are
ruins
and
i
have
never
cared
to
cover
myself
with
dust
going
among
don
cayetano
made
an
expressive
grimace
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
condemn
archaeology
said
dona
perfecta
s
nephew
quickly
observing
with
pain
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
without
wounding
some
one
i
know
that
from
that
dust
issues
history
those
studies
are
delightful
and
very
you
said
the
penitentiary
putting
his
toothpick
into
the
last
of
his
back
teeth
are
no
doubt
more
inclined
to
controversial
studies
an
excellent
idea
has
just
occurred
to
me
senor
don
jose
you
ought
to
be
a
law
is
a
profession
which
i
abhor
replied
pepe
rey
i
know
many
estimable
lawyers
among
them
my
father
who
is
the
best
of
men
but
in
spite
of
so
favorable
a
specimen
i
could
never
had
brought
myself
to
practise
a
profession
which
consists
in
defending
with
equal
readiness
the
and
the
of
a
question
i
know
of
no
greater
misjudgment
no
greater
prejudice
no
greater
blindness
than
parents
show
in
their
eagerness
to
dedicate
their
sons
to
the
law
the
chief
and
the
most
terrible
plague
of
spain
is
the
crowd
of
our
young
lawyers
for
whose
existence
a
fabulous
number
of
lawsuits
are
necessary
lawsuits
multiply
in
proportion
to
the
demand
and
even
thus
numbers
are
left
without
employment
and
as
a
jurisconsult
can
not
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
or
seat
himself
at
the
loom
the
result
is
that
brilliant
squadron
of
idlers
full
of
pretensions
who
clamor
for
places
embarrass
the
administration
agitate
public
opinion
and
breed
revolutions
in
some
way
they
must
make
a
living
it
would
be
a
greater
misfortune
if
there
were
lawsuits
enough
for
all
of
pepe
for
heaven
s
sake
take
care
what
you
say
said
dona
perfecta
in
a
tone
of
marked
severity
but
excuse
him
senor
don
inocencio
for
he
is
not
aware
that
you
have
a
nephew
who
although
he
has
only
lately
left
the
university
is
a
prodigy
in
the
i
speak
in
general
terms
said
pepe
with
firmness
being
as
i
am
the
son
of
a
distinguished
lawyer
i
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
there
are
many
men
who
practise
that
noble
profession
with
honor
to
no
my
nephew
is
only
a
boy
yet
said
the
canon
with
affected
humility
far
be
it
from
me
to
assert
that
he
is
a
prodigy
of
learning
like
senor
de
rey
in
time
who
can
tell
his
talents
are
neither
brilliant
nor
seductive
of
course
jacinto
s
ideas
are
solid
and
his
judgment
is
sound
what
he
knows
he
knows
thoroughly
he
is
unacquainted
with
sophistries
and
hollow
pepe
rey
appeared
every
moment
more
and
more
disturbed
the
idea
that
without
desiring
it
his
opinions
should
be
in
opposition
to
those
of
the
friends
of
his
aunt
vexed
him
and
he
resolved
to
remain
silent
lest
he
and
don
inocencio
should
end
by
throwing
the
plates
at
each
other
s
heads
fortunately
the
cathedral
bell
calling
the
canon
to
the
important
duties
of
the
choir
extricated
him
from
his
painful
position
the
venerable
ecclesiastic
rose
and
took
leave
of
every
one
treating
rey
with
as
much
amiability
and
kindness
as
if
they
had
been
old
and
dear
friends
the
canon
after
offering
his
services
to
pepe
for
all
that
he
might
require
promised
to
present
his
nephew
to
him
in
order
that
the
young
man
might
accompany
him
to
see
the
town
speaking
in
the
most
affectionate
terms
and
deigning
on
leaving
the
room
to
pat
him
on
the
shoulder

accepting
with
pleasure
these
formulas
of
concord
nevertheless
felt
indescribably
relieved
when
the
priest
had
left
the
and
the
house
chapter
viii
in
all
haste
a
little
later
the
scene
had
changed
don
cayetano
finding
rest
from
his
sublime
labors
in
a
gentle
slumber
that
had
overcome
him
after
dinner
reclined
comfortably
in
an
in
the
rosarito
seated
at
one
of
the
windows
that
opened
into
the
garden
glanced
at
her
cousin
saying
to
him
with
the
mute
eloquence
of
her
eyes
cousin
sit
down
here
beside
me
and
tell
me
every
thing
you
have
to
say
to
her
cousin
mathematician
though
he
was
understood
my
dear
cousin
said
pepe
how
you
must
have
been
bored
this
afternoon
by
our
disputes
heaven
knows
that
for
my
own
pleasure
i
would
not
have
played
the
pedant
as
i
did
the
canon
was
to
blame
for
it
do
you
know
that
that
priest
appears
to
me
to
be
a
singular
character
he
is
an
excellent
person
responded
rosarito
showing
the
delight
she
felt
at
being
able
to
give
her
cousin
all
the
data
and
the
information
that
he
might
require
oh
yes
an
excellent
person
that
is
very
evident
when
you
know
him
a
little
better
you
will
see
that
he
is
beyond
all
price
but
it
is
enough
for
him
to
be
your
friend
and
your
mamma
s
to
be
my
friend
also
declared
the
young
man
and
does
he
come
here
often
every
day
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
his
time
with
us
responded
rosarito
ingenuously
how
good
and
kind
he
is
and
how
fond
he
is
of
me
come
i
begin
to
like
this
he
comes
in
the
evening
besides
to
play
tresillo
continued
the
young
girl
for
every
night
some
friends
meet
here
the
judge
of
the
lower
court
the
the
dean
the
bishop
s
secretary
the
alcalde
the
collector
of
taxes
don
inocencio
s
nephew
ah
jacintito
the
yes
he
is
a
boy
as
good
as
gold
his
uncle
adores
him
since
he
returned
from
the
university
with
his
doctor
s
tassel
for
he
is
a
doctor
in
two
sciences
and
he
took
honors
besides
what
do
you
think
of
that
well
as
i
was
saying
since
his
return
he
has
come
here
very
often
with
his
uncle
mamma
too
is
very
fond
of
him
he
is
a
very
sensible
boy
he
goes
home
early
with
his
uncle
he
never
goes
at
night
to
the
casino
nor
plays
nor
squanders
money
and
he
is
employed
in
the
office
of
don
lorenzo
ruiz
who
is
the
best
lawyer
in
orbajosa
they
say
jacinto
will
be
a
great
lawyer
his
uncle
did
not
exaggerate
when
he
praised
him
then
said
pepe
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
talked
all
that
nonsense
i
did
about
lawyers
i
was
very
perverse
was
i
not
my
dear
cousin
not
at
all
for
my
part
i
think
you
were
quite
but
really
was
i
not
a
little
not
in
the
least
not
in
the
least
what
a
weight
you
have
taken
off
my
mind
the
truth
is
that
i
found
myself
constantly
and
without
knowing
why
in
distressing
opposition
to
that
venerable
priest
i
am
very
sorry
for
what
i
think
said
rosarito
looking
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
affection
is
that
you
will
not
find
yourself
at
home
among
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
don
t
know
whether
i
can
make
myself
quite
clear
cousin
i
mean
that
it
will
not
be
easy
for
you
to
accustom
yourself
to
the
society
and
the
ideas
of
the
people
of
orbajosa
i
imagine
so
it
is
a
oh
no
i
think
you
are
you
come
from
a
different
place
from
another
world
where
the
people
are
very
clever
and
very
learned
and
have
refined
manners
and
a
witty
way
of
talking
and
an
air
perhaps
i
am
not
making
myself
clear
i
mean
that
you
are
accustomed
to
live
among
people
of
refinement
you
know
a
great
deal
here
there
is
not
what
you
need
here
the
people
are
not
learned
or
very
polished
every
thing
is
plain
pepe
i
imagine
you
will
be
bored
terribly
bored
and
that
in
the
end
you
will
have
to
go
the
expression
of
sadness
which
was
natural
in
rosarito
s
countenance
here
became
so
profound
that
pepe
rey
was
deeply
moved
you
are
mistaken
my
dear
cousin
i
did
not
come
here
with
the
ideas
you
fancy
nor
is
there
between
my
character
and
my
opinions
and
the
character
and
opinions
of
the
people
here
the
want
of
harmony
you
imagine
but
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
there
let
us
suppose
in
that
case
i
have
the
firm
conviction
that
between
you
and
me
between
us
two
dear
rosarito
perfect
harmony
would
still
exist
on
this
point
i
can
not
be
mistaken
my
heart
tells
me
that
i
am
not
rosarito
blushed
deeply
but
making
an
effort
to
conceal
her
embarrassment
under
smiles
and
fugitive
glances
she
said
come
now
no
pretences
but
if
you
mean
that
i
shall
always
approve
of
what
you
say
you
are
rosario
exclaimed
the
young
man
the
moment
i
saw
you
my
soul
was
filled
with
gladness
i
felt
at
the
same
time
a
regret
that
i
had
not
come
before
to
now
that
i
am
not
going
to
believe
she
said
affecting
gayety
to
conceal
her
emotion
so
soon
don
t
begin
to
make
protestations
already
see
pepe
i
am
only
a
country
girl
i
can
talk
only
about
common
things
i
don
t
know
french
i
don
t
dress
with
elegance
all
i
know
is
how
to
play
the
piano
i
oh
rosario
cried
the
young
man
with
ardor
i
believed
you
to
be
perfect
before
now
i
am
sure
you
are
her
mother
at
this
moment
entered
the
room
rosarito
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
answer
to
her
cousin
s
last
words
was
conscious
however
of
the
necessity
of
saying
something
and
looking
at
her
mother
she
cried
ah
i
forgot
to
give
the
parrot
his
don
t
mind
that
now
but
why
do
you
stay
in
here
take
your
cousin
for
a
walk
in
the
dona
perfecta
smiled
with
maternal
kindness
at
her
nephew
as
she
pointed
toward
the
leafy
avenue
which
was
visible
through
the
glass
door
let
us
go
there
said
pepe
rising
rosarito
darted
like
a
bird
released
from
its
cage
toward
the
glass
door
pepe
who
knows
so
much
and
who
must
understand
all
about
trees
said
dona
perfecta
will
teach
you
how
to
graft
let
us
see
what
he
thinks
of
those
young
that
they
are
going
to
come
come
called
rosarito
to
her
cousin
impatiently
from
the
garden
both
disappeared
among
the
foliage
dona
perfecta
watched
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
and
then
busied
herself
with
the
parrot
as
she
changed
its
food
she
said
to
herself
with
a
contemplative
air
how
different
he
is
he
has
not
even
given
a
caress
to
the
poor
then
thinking
it
possible
that
she
had
been
overheard
by
her
she
said
aloud
cayetano
what
do
you
think
of
my
nephew
cayetano
a
low
grunt
gave
evidence
that
the
antiquary
was
returning
to
the
consciousness
of
this
miserable
world
cayetano
just
so
just
so
murmured
the
scientist
in
a
sleepy
voice
that
young
gentleman
will
maintain
as
every
one
does
that
the
statues
of
mundogrande
belong
to
the
first
phoenician
immigration
but
i
will
convince
him
but
cayetano
but
perfecta
there
now
you
will
insist
upon
it
again
that
i
have
been
no
indeed
how
could
i
insist
upon
any
thing
so
absurd
but
you
haven
t
told
me
what
you
think
about
that
young
don
cayetano
placed
the
palm
of
his
hand
before
his
mouth
to
conceal
a
yawn
then
he
and
dona
perfecta
entered
upon
a
long
conversation
those
who
have
transmitted
to
us
the
necessary
data
for
a
compilation
of
this
history
omit
this
dialogue
no
doubt
because
it
was
entirely
confidential
as
for
what
the
engineer
and
rosarito
said
in
the
garden
that
afternoon
it
is
evident
that
it
was
not
worthy
of
mention
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
however
events
took
place
which
being
of
the
gravest
importance
ought
not
to
be
passed
over
in
silence
late
in
the
afternoon
the
two
cousins
found
themselves
alone
after
rambling
through
different
parts
of
the
garden
in
friendly
companionship
and
having
eyes
and
ears
only
for
each
other
pepe
rosario
was
saying
all
that
you
have
been
telling
me
is
pure
fancy
one
of
those
stories
that
you
clever
men
know
so
well
how
to
put
together
you
think
that
because
i
am
a
country
girl
i
believe
every
thing
i
am
if
you
understood
me
as
well
as
i
think
i
understand
you
you
would
know
that
i
never
say
any
thing
i
do
not
mean
but
let
us
have
done
with
foolish
subtleties
and
lovers
sophistries
that
lead
only
to
misunderstandings
i
will
speak
to
you
only
in
the
language
of
truth
are
you
by
chance
a
young
lady
whose
acquaintance
i
have
made
on
the
promenade
or
at
a
party
and
with
whom
i
propose
to
spend
a
pleasant
hour
or
two
no
you
are
my
cousin
you
are
something
more
rosario
let
us
at
once
put
things
on
their
proper
footing
let
us
drop
circumlocutions
i
have
come
here
to
marry
rosario
felt
her
face
burning
and
her
heart
was
beating
violently
see
my
dear
cousin
continued
the
young
man
i
swear
to
you
that
if
you
had
not
pleased
me
i
should
be
already
far
away
from
this
place
although
politeness
and
delicacy
would
have
obliged
me
to
make
an
effort
to
conceal
my
disappointment
i
should
have
found
it
hard
to
do
so
that
is
my
cousin
you
have
only
just
arrived
said
rosarito
laconically
trying
to
laugh
i
have
only
just
arrived
and
i
already
know
all
that
i
wanted
to
know
i
know
that
i
love
you
that
you
are
the
woman
whom
my
heart
has
long
been
announcing
to
me
saying
to
me
night
and
day
now
she
is
coming
now
she
is
near
now
you
are
these
words
served
rosario
as
an
excuse
for
breaking
into
the
laugh
that
had
been
dimpling
her
lips
her
soul
swelled
with
happiness
she
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
joy
you
persist
in
depreciating
yourself
continued
pepe
but
for
me
you
possess
every
perfection
you
have
the
admirable
quality
of
radiating
on
all
around
you
the
divine
light
of
your
soul
the
moment
one
sees
you
one
feels
instinctively
the
nobility
of
your
mind
and
the
purity
of
your
heart
to
see
you
is
to
see
a
celestial
being
who
through
the
forgetfulness
of
heaven
remains
upon
the
earth
you
are
an
angel
and
i
adore
when
he
had
said
this
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
fulfilled
an
important
mission
rosarito
overcome
by
the
violence
of
her
emotion
felt
her
scant
strength
suddenly
fail
her
and
she
sank
on
a
stone
that
in
those
pleasant
solitudes
served
as
a
seat
pepe
bent
over
her
her
eyes
were
closed
her
forehead
rested
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
a
few
moments
later
the
daughter
of
dona
perfecta
polentinos
gave
her
cousin
amid
happy
tears
a
tender
glance
followed
by
these
words
i
loved
you
before
i
had
ever
seen
placing
her
hands
in
those
of
the
young
man
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
their
forms
disappeared
among
the
leafy
branches
of
an
oleander
walk
night
was
falling
and
soft
shadows
enveloped
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
while
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
crowned
the
with
fleeting
splendors
the
noisy
republic
of
the
birds
kept
up
a
deafening
clamor
in
the
upper
branches
it
was
the
hour
in
which
after
flitting
about
in
the
joyous
regions
of
the
sky
they
were
all
going
to
rest
and
they
were
disputing
with
one
another
the
branches
they
had
selected
for
their
chatter
at
times
had
a
sound
of
recrimination
and
controversy
at
times
of
mockery
and
merriment
in
their
voluble
twitter
the
little
rascals
said
the
most
insulting
things
to
each
other
pecking
at
each
other
and
flapping
their
wings
as
orators
wave
their
arms
when
they
want
to
make
their
hearers
believe
the
lies
they
are
telling
them
but
words
of
love
were
to
be
heard
there
too
for
the
peace
of
the
hour
and
the
beauty
of
the
spot
invited
to
it
a
sharp
ear
might
have
distinguished
the
following
i
loved
you
before
i
had
even
seen
you
and
if
you
had
not
come
i
should
have
died
of
grief
mamma
used
to
give
me
your
father
s
letters
to
read
and
he
praised
you
so
much
in
them
that
i
used
to
say
that
is
the
man
who
ought
to
be
my
for
a
long
time
your
father
said
nothing
about
our
marrying
which
seemed
to
me
great
negligence
uncle
cayetano
whenever
he
spoke
of
you
would
say
there
are
not
many
men
like
him
in
the
world
the
woman
who
gets
him
for
a
husband
may
think
herself
at
last
your
father
said
what
he
could
not
avoid
saying
yes
he
could
not
avoid
saying
it
i
was
expecting
it
every
shortly
after
these
words
the
same
voice
added
uneasily
some
one
is
following
emerging
from
among
the
oleanders
pepe
turning
round
saw
two
men
approaching
them
and
touching
the
leaves
of
a
young
tree
near
by
he
said
aloud
to
his
companion
it
is
not
proper
to
prune
young
trees
like
this
for
the
first
time
until
they
have
taken
firm
root
trees
recently
planted
have
not
sufficient
strength
to
bear
the
operation
you
know
that
the
roots
can
grow
only
by
means
of
the
leaves
so
that
if
you
take
the
leaves
from
a
tree
ah
senor
don

cried
the
penitentiary
with
a
frank
laugh
approaching
the
two
young
people
and
bowing
to
them

then
the

turned
round
and
indicating
by
a
gesture
a
young
man
who
was
behind

the
disagreement
continues
to
increase
and
thereafter
to
become
discord
close
beside
the
black
cassock
was
a
fresh
and
rosy
face
that
seemed
fresher
and
rosier
from
the
contrast
jacinto
saluted
our
hero
not
without
some
embarrassment
he
was
one
of
those
precocious
youths
whom
the
indulgent
university
sends
prematurely
forth
into
the
arena
of
life
making
them
fancy
that
they
are
men
because
they
have
received
their
doctor
s
degree
jacinto
had
a
round
handsome
face
with
rosy
cheeks
like
a
girl
s
and
without
any
beard
save
the
down
which
announced
its
coming
in
person
he
was
plump
and
below
the
medium
height
his
age
was
a
little
over
twenty
he
had
been
educated
from
childhood
under
the
direction
of
his
excellent
and
learned
uncle
which
is
the
same
as
saying
that
the
twig
had
not
become
crooked
in
the
growing
a
severe
moral
training
had
kept
him
always
straight
and
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
scholastic
duties
he
had
been
almost
above
reproach
having
concluded
his
studies
at
the
university
with
astonishing
success
for
there
was
scarcely
a
class
in
which
he
did
not
take
the
highest
honors
he
entered
on
the
practice
of
his
profession
promising
by
his
application
and
his
aptitude
for
the
law
to
maintain
fresh
and
green
in
the
forum
the
laurels
of
the
at
times
he
was
as
mischievous
as
a
boy
at
times
as
sedate
as
a
man
in
very
truth
if
jacinto
had
not
had
a
little
and
even
a
great
deal
of
liking
for
pretty
girls
his
uncle
would
have
thought
him
perfect
the
worthy
man
preached
to
him
unceasingly
on
this
point
hastening
to
clip
the
wings
of
every
audacious
fancy
but
not
even
this
mundane
inclination
of
the
young
man
could
cool
the
great
affection
which
our
worthy
canon
bore
the
charming
offspring
of
his
dear
niece
maria
remedios
where
the
young
lawyer
was
concerned
every
thing
else
must
give
way
even
the
grave
and
methodical
habits
of
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
were
altered
when
they
interfered
with
the
affairs
of
his
precocious
pupil
that
order
and
regularity
apparently
as
fixed
as
the
laws
of
a
planetary
system
were
interrupted
whenever
jacinto
was
ill
or
had
to
take
a
journey
useless
celibacy
of
the
clergy
the
council
of
trent
prohibits
them
from
having
children
of
their
own
but
god
and
not
the
devil
as
the
proverb
says
gives
them
nephews
and
nieces
in
order
that
they
may
know
the
tender
anxieties
of
paternity
examining
impartially
the
qualities
of
this
clever
boy
it
was
impossible
not
to
recognize
that
he
was
not
wanting
in
merit
his
character
was
in
the
main
inclined
to
uprightness
and
noble
actions
awakened
a
frank
admiration
in
his
soul
with
respect
to
his
intellectual
endowments
and
his
social
knowledge
they
were
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
become
in
time
one
of
those
notabilities
of
whom
there
are
so
many
in
spain
he
might
be
what
we
take
delight
in
calling
hyperbolically
a
distinguished
patrician
or
an
eminent
public
man
species
which
owing
to
their
great
abundance
are
hardly
appreciated
at
their
just
value
in
the
tender
age
in
which
the
university
degree
serves
as
a
sort
of
solder
between
boyhood
and
manhood
few
young
men
especially
if
they
have
been
spoiled
by
their
masters
are
free
from
an
offensive
pedantry
which
if
it
gives
them
great
importance
beside
their
mamma
s
makes
them
very
ridiculous
when
they
are
among
grave
and
experienced
men
jacinto
had
this
defect
which
was
excusable
in
him
not
only
because
of
his
youth
but
also
because
his
worthy
uncle
stimulated
his
puerile
vanity
by
injudicious
praise
when
the
introduction
was
over
they
resumed
their
walk
jacinto
was
silent
the
canon
returning
to
the
interrupted
theme
of
the
which
were
to
be
grafted
and
the
which
were
to
be
trimmed
said
i
am
already
aware
that
senor
don
jose
is
a
great
not
at
all
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
subject
responded
the
young
man
observing
with
no
little
annoyance
the
canon
s
mania
of
supposing
him
to
be
learned
in
all
the
sciences
oh
yes
a
great
agriculturist
continued
the
penitentiary
but
on
agricultural
subjects
don
t
quote
the
latest
treatises
to
me
for
me
the
whole
of
that
science
senor
de
rey
is
condensed
in
what
i
call
the
bible
of
the
field
in
the
georgics
of
the
immortal
roman
it
is
all
admirable
from
that
grand
sentence
vero
terroe
ferre
omnes
omnia
that
is
to
say
that
not
every
soil
is
suited
to
every
tree
senor
don
jose
to
the
exhaustive
treatise
on
bees
in
which
the
poet
describes
the
habits
of
those
wise
little
animals
defining
the
drone
in
these
words
ille
horridus
alter
desidia
latamque
trahens
inglorius
of
a
horrible
and
slothful
figure
dragging
along
the
ignoble
weight
of
the
belly
senor
don
you
do
well
to
translate
it
for
me
said
pepe
for
i
know
very
little
oh
why
should
the
men
of
the
present
day
spend
their
time
in
studying
things
that
are
out
of
date
said
the
canon
ironically
besides
only
poor
creatures
like
virgil
and
cicero
and
livy
wrote
in
latin
i
however
am
of
a
different
way
of
thinking
as
witness
my
nephew
to
whom
i
have
taught
that
sublime
language
the
rascal
knows
it
better
than
i
do
the
worst
of
it
is
that
with
his
modern
reading
he
is
forgetting
it
and
some
fine
day
without
ever
having
suspected
it
he
will
find
out
that
he
is
an
ignoramus
for
senor
don
jose
my
nephew
has
taken
to
studying
the
newest
books
and
the
most
extravagant
theories
and
it
is
flammarion
here
and
flammarion
there
and
nothing
will
do
him
but
that
the
stars
are
full
of
people
come
i
fancy
that
you
two
are
going
to
be
very
good
friends
jacinto
beg
this
gentleman
to
teach
you
the
higher
mathematics
to
instruct
you
concerning
the
german
philosophers
and
then
you
will
be
a
the
worthy
ecclesiastic
laughed
at
his
own
wit
while
jacinto
delighted
to
see
the
conversation
turn
on
a
theme
so
greatly
to
his
taste
after
excusing
himself
to
pepe
rey
suddenly
hurled
this
question
at
him
tell
me
senor
don
jose
what
do
you
think
of
darwinism
our
hero
smiled
at
this
inopportune
pedantry
and
he
felt
almost
tempted
to
encourage
the
young
man
to
continue
in
this
path
of
childish
vanity
but
judging
it
more
prudent
to
avoid
intimacy
either
with
the
nephew
or
the
uncle
he
answered
simply
i
can
think
nothing
at
all
about
the
doctrines
of
darwin
for
i
know
scarcely
any
thing
about
him
my
professional
labors
have
not
permitted
me
to
devote
much
of
my
time
to
those
well
said
the
canon
laughing
it
all
reduces
itself
to
this
that
we
are
descended
from
monkeys
if
he
had
said
that
only
in
the
case
of
certain
people
i
know
he
would
have
been
the
theory
of
natural
selection
said
jacinto
emphatically
has
they
say
a
great
many
partisans
in
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
the
ecclesiastic
in
germany
they
would
have
no
reason
to
be
sorry
if
that
theory
were
true
as
far
as
bismarck
is
dona
perfecta
and
senor
don
cayetano
at
this
moment
made
their
appearance
what
a
beautiful
evening
said
the
former
well
nephew
are
you
getting
terribly
bored
i
am
not
bored
in
the
least
responded
the
young
man
don
t
try
to
deny
it
cayetano
and
i
were
speaking
of
that
as
we
came
along
you
are
bored
and
you
are
trying
to
hide
it
it
is
not
every
young
man
of
the
present
day
who
would
have
the
to
spend
his
youth
like
jacinto
in
a
town
where
there
are
neither
theatres
nor
opera
bouffe
nor
dancers
nor
philosophers
nor
athenaeums
nor
magazines
nor
congresses
nor
any
other
kind
of
diversions
or
i
am
quite
contented
here
responded
pepe
i
was
just
now
saying
to
rosario
that
i
find
this
city
and
this
house
so
pleasant
that
i
would
like
to
live
and
die
rosario
turned
very
red
and
the
others
were
silent
they
all
sat
down
in
a
jacinto
hastening
to
take
the
seat
on
the
left
of
the
young
girl
see
here
nephew
i
have
a
piece
of
advice
to
give
you
said
dona
perfecta
smiling
with
that
expression
of
kindness
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
her
soul
like
the
aroma
from
the
flower
but
don
t
imagine
that
i
am
either
reproving
you
or
giving
you
a
lesson
you
are
not
a
child
and
you
will
easily
understand
what
i
scold
me
dear
aunt
for
no
doubt
i
deserve
it
replied
pepe
who
was
beginning
to
accustom
himself
to
the
kindnesses
of
his
father
s
sister
no
it
is
only
a
piece
of
advice
these
gentlemen
i
am
sure
will
agree
that
i
am
in
the
rosario
was
listening
with
her
whole
soul
it
is
only
this
continued
dona
perfecta
that
when
you
visit
our
beautiful
cathedral
again
you
will
endeavor
to
behave
with
a
little
more
decorum
while
you
are
in
why
what
have
i
done
it
does
not
surprise
me
that
you
are
not
yourself
aware
of
your
fault
said
his
aunt
with
apparent
good
humor
it
is
only
natural
accustomed
as
you
are
to
enter
athenaeums
and
clubs
and
academies
and
congresses
without
any
ceremony
you
think
that
you
can
enter
a
temple
in
which
the
divine
majesty
is
in
the
same
but
excuse
me
senora
said
pepe
gravely
i
entered
the
cathedral
with
the
greatest
but
i
am
not
scolding
you
man
i
am
not
scolding
you
if
you
take
it
in
that
way
i
shall
have
to
remain
silent
excuse
my
nephew
gentlemen
a
little
carelessness
a
little
heedlessness
on
his
part
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
how
many
years
is
it
since
you
set
foot
in
a
sacred
place
before
senora
i
assure
you
but
in
short
let
my
religious
ideas
be
what
they
may
i
am
in
the
habit
of
observing
the
utmost
decorum
in
what
i
assure
you
is
there
if
you
are
going
to
be
offended
i
won
t
go
on
what
i
assure
you
is
that
a
great
many
people
noticed
it
this
morning
the
senores
de
gonzalez
dona
robustiana
serafinita
in
short
when
i
tell
you
that
you
attracted
the
attention
of
the
bishop
his
lordship
complained
to
me
about
it
this
afternoon
when
i
was
at
my
cousin
s
he
told
me
that
he
did
not
order
you
to
be
put
out
of
the
church
only
because
you
were
my
rosario
looked
anxiously
at
her
cousin
trying
to
read
in
his
countenance
before
he
uttered
it
the
answer
he
would
make
to
these
charges
no
doubt
they
mistook
me
for
some
one
no
no
it
was
you
but
there
don
t
get
angry
we
are
talking
here
among
friends
and
in
confidence
it
was
you
i
saw
you
you
saw
me
just
so
will
you
deny
that
you
went
to
look
at
the
pictures
passing
among
a
group
of
worshippers
who
were
hearing
mass
i
assure
you
that
my
attention
was
so
distracted
by
your
comings
and
goings
that
well
you
must
not
do
it
again
then
you
went
into
the
chapel
of
san
gregorio
at
the
elevation
of
the
host
at
the
high
altar
you
did
not
even
turn
around
to
make
a
gesture
of
reverence
afterward
you
traversed
the
whole
length
of
the
church
you
went
up
to
the
tomb
of
the
adelantado
you
touched
the
altar
with
your
hands
then
you
passed
a
second
time
among
a
group
of
worshippers
attracting
the
notice
of
every
one
all
the
girls
looked
at
you
and
you
seemed
pleased
at
disturbing
so
finely
the
devotions
of
those
good
good
heavens
how
many
things
i
have
done
exclaimed
pepe
half
angry
half
amused
i
am
a
monster
it
seems
without
ever
having
suspected
no
i
am
very
well
aware
that
you
are
a
good
boy
said
dona
perfecta
observing
the
canon
s
expression
of
unalterable
gravity
which
gave
his
face
the
appearance
of
a
pasteboard
mask
but
my
dear
boy
between
thinking
things
and
showing
them
in
that
irreverent
manner
there
is
a
distance
which
a
man
of
good
sense
and
good
breeding
should
never
cross
i
am
well
aware
that
your
ideas
are
now
don
t
get
angry
if
you
get
angry
i
will
be
silent
i
say
that
it
is
one
thing
to
have
certain
ideas
about
religion
and
another
thing
to
express
them
i
will
take
good
care
not
to
reproach
you
because
you
believe
that
god
did
not
create
us
in
his
image
and
likeness
but
that
we
are
descended
from
the
monkeys
nor
because
you
deny
the
existence
of
the
soul
asserting
that
it
is
a
drug
like
the
little
papers
of
rhubarb
and
magnesia
that
are
sold
at
the
apothecary
s
senora
for
heaven
s
sake
exclaimed
pepe
with
annoyance
i
see
that
i
have
a
very
bad
reputation
in
the
others
remained
silent
as
i
said
i
will
not
reproach
you
for
entertaining
those
ideas
and
besides
i
have
not
the
right
to
do
so
if
i
should
undertake
to
argue
with
you
you
with
your
wonderful
talents
would
confute
me
a
thousand
times
over
no
i
will
not
attempt
any
thing
of
that
kind
what
i
say
is
that
these
poor
and
humble
inhabitants
of
orbajosa
are
pious
and
good
christians
although
they
know
nothing
about
german
philosophy
and
that
therefore
you
ought
not
publicly
to
manifest
your
contempt
for
their
my
dear
aunt
said
the
engineer
gravely
i
have
shown
no
contempt
for
any
one
nor
do
i
entertain
the
ideas
which
you
attribute
to
me
perhaps
i
may
have
been
a
little
wanting
in
reverence
in
the
church
i
am
somewhat
my
thoughts
and
my
attention
were
engaged
with
the
architecture
of
the
building
and
frankly
speaking
i
did
not
observe
but
this
was
no
reason
for
the
bishop
to
think
of
putting
me
out
of
the
church
nor
for
you
to
suppose
me
capable
of
attributing
to
a
paper
from
the
apothecary
s
the
functions
of
the
soul
i
may
tolerate
that
as
a
jest
but
only
as
a
the
agitation
of
pepe
rey
s
mind
was
so
great
that
notwithstanding
his
natural
prudence
and
moderation
he
was
unable
to
conceal
it
there
i
see
that
you
are
angry
said
dona
perfecta
casting
down
her
eyes
and
clasping
her
hands
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
had
known
that
you
would
have
taken
it
in
that
way
i
should
not
have
spoken
to
you
pepe
i
ask
your
hearing
these
words
and
seeing
his
kind
aunt
s
deprecating
attitude
pepe
felt
ashamed
of
the
sternness
of
his
last
words
and
he
made
an
effort
to
recover
his
serenity
the
venerable
penitentiary
extricated
him
from
his
embarrassing
position
saying
with
his
accustomed
benevolent
smile
senora
dona
perfecta
we
must
be
tolerant
with
artists
oh
i
have
known
a
great
many
of
them
those
gentlemen
when
they
have
before
them
a
statue
a
piece
of
rusty
armor
a
mouldy
painting
or
an
old
wall
forget
every
thing
else
senor
don
jose
is
an
artist
and
he
has
visited
our
cathedral
as
the
english
visit
it
who
would
willingly
carry
it
away
with
them
to
their
museums
to
its
last
tile
if
they
could
that
the
worshippers
were
praying
that
the
priest
was
elevating
the
sacred
host
that
the
moment
of
supreme
piety
and
devotion
had
come
what
of
that
what
does
all
that
matter
to
an
artist
it
is
true
that
i
do
not
know
what
art
is
worth
apart
from
the
sentiments
which
it
expresses
but
in
fine
at
the
present
day
it
is
the
custom
to
adore
the
form
not
the
idea
god
preserve
me
from
undertaking
to
discuss
this
question
with
senor
don
jose
who
knows
so
much
and
who
reasoning
with
the
admirable
subtlety
of
the
moderns
would
instantly
confound
my
mind
in
which
there
is
only
the
determination
which
you
all
have
to
regard
me
as
the
most
learned
man
on
earth
annoys
me
exceedingly
said
pepe
speaking
in
his
former
hard
tone
hold
me
for
a
fool
for
i
would
rather
be
regarded
as
a
fool
than
as
the
possessor
of
that
satanic
knowledge
which
is
here
attributed
to
rosarito
laughed
and
jacinto
thought
that
a
highly
opportune
moment
had
now
arrived
to
make
a
display
of
his
own
erudition
pantheism
or
panentheism
he
said
is
condemned
by
the
church
as
well
as
by
the
teachings
of
schopenhauer
and
of
the
modern
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
canon
gravely
men
who
pay
so
fervent
a
worship
to
art
though
it
be
only
to
its
form
deserve
the
greatest
respect
it
is
better
to
be
an
artist
and
delight
in
the
contemplation
of
beauty
though
this
be
only
represented
by
nude
nymphs
than
to
be
indifferent
and
incredulous
in
every
thing
the
mind
that
consecrates
itself
to
the
contemplation
of
beauty
evil
will
not
take
complete
possession
of
deus
in
be
it
well
understood
let
senor
don
jose
then
continue
to
admire
the
marvels
of
our
church
i
for
one
will
willingly
forgive
him
his
acts
of
irreverence
with
all
due
respect
for
the
opinions
of
the
thanks
senor
don
inocencio
said
pepe
feeling
a
bitter
and
rebellious
sentiment
of
hostility
springing
up
within
him
toward
the
canon
and
unable
to
conquer
his
desire
to
mortify
him
but
let
none
of
you
imagine
either
that
it
was
the
beauties
of
art
of
which
you
suppose
the
temple
to
be
full
that
engaged
my
attention
those
beauties
with
the
exception
of
the
imposing
architecture
of
a
portion
of
the
edifice
and
of
the
three
tombs
that
are
in
the
chapel
of
the
apse
i
do
not
see
what
occupied
my
mind
was
the
consideration
of
the
deplorable
decadence
of
the
religious
arts
and
the
innumerable
monstrosities
of
which
the
cathedral
is
full
caused
me
not
astonishment
but
the
amazement
of
all
present
was
profound
i
can
not
endure
continued
pepe
those
glazed
and
painted
images
that
resemble
so
much
god
forgive
me
for
the
comparison
the
dolls
that
little
girls
pay
with
and
what
am
i
to
say
of
the
theatrical
robes
that
cover
them
i
saw
a
joseph
with
a
mantle
whose
appearance
i
will
not
describe
out
of
respect
for
the
holy
patriarch
and
for
the
church
of
which
he
is
the
patron
on
the
altar
are
crowded
together
images
in
the
worst
possible
taste
and
the
innumerable
crowns
branches
stars
moons
and
other
ornaments
of
metal
or
gilt
paper
have
an
air
of
an
ironmongery
that
offends
the
religious
sentiment
and
depresses
the
soul
far
from
lifting
itself
up
to
religious
contemplation
the
soul
sinks
and
the
idea
of
the
ludicrous
distracts
it
the
great
works
of
art
which
give
sensible
form
to
ideas
to
dogmas
to
religious
faith
to
mystic
exaltation
fulfil
a
noble
mission
the
caricatures
the
aberrations
of
taste
the
grotesque
works
with
which
a
mistaken
piety
fills
the
church
also
fulfil
their
object
but
this
is
a
sad
one
enough
they
encourage
superstition
cool
enthusiasm
oblige
the
eyes
of
the
believer
to
turn
away
from
the
altar
and
with
the
eyes
the
souls
that
have
not
a
very
profound
and
a
very
firm
faith
turn
away
the
doctrine
of
the
iconoclasts
too
said
jacinto
has
it
seems
spread
widely
in
i
am
not
an
iconoclast
although
i
would
prefer
the
destruction
of
all
the
images
to
the
exhibition
of
buffooneries
of
which
i
speak
continued
the
young
man
seeing
it
one
may
justly
advocate
a
return
of
religious
worship
to
the
august
simplicity
of
olden
times
but
no
let
us
not
renounce
the
admirable
aid
which
all
the
arts
beginning
with
poetry
and
ending
with
music
lend
to
the
relations
between
man
and
god
let
the
arts
live
let
the
utmost
pomp
be
displayed
in
religious
ceremonies
i
am
a
partisan
of
an
artist
an
artist
and
nothing
more
than
an
artist
exclaimed
the
canon
shaking
his
head
with
a
sorrowful
air
fine
pictures
fine
statues
beautiful
music
pleasure
for
the
senses
and
let
the
devil
take
the
soul
apropos
of
music
said
pepe
rey
without
observing
the
deplorable
effect
which
his
words
produced
on
both
mother
and
daughter
imagine
how
disposed
my
mind
would
be
to
religious
contemplation
on
entering
the
cathedral
when
just
at
that
moment
and
precisely
at
the
offertory
at
high
mass
the
organist
played
a
passage
from
senor
de
rey
is
right
in
that
said
the
little
lawyer
emphatically
the
organist
played
the
other
day
the
whole
of
the
drinking
song
and
the
waltz
from
the
same
opera
and
afterward
a
rondeau
from
the
grande
but
when
i
felt
my
heart
sink
continued
the
engineer
implacably
was
when
i
saw
an
image
of
the
virgin
which
seems
to
be
held
in
great
veneration
judging
from
the
crowd
before
it
and
the
multitude
of
tapers
which
lighted
it
they
have
dressed
her
in
a
garment
of
velvet
embroidered
with
gold
of
a
shape
so
extraordinary
that
it
surpasses
the
most
extravagant
of
the
fashions
of
the
day
her
face
is
almost
hidden
under
a
voluminous
frill
made
of
innumerable
rows
of
lace
crimped
with
a
and
her
crown
half
a
yard
in
height
surrounded
by
golden
rays
looks
like
a
hideous
catafalque
erected
over
her
head
of
the
same
material
and
embroidered
in
the
same
manner
are
the
trousers
of
the
infant
jesus
i
will
not
go
on
for
to
describe
the
mother
and
the
child
might
perhaps
lead
me
to
commit
some
irreverence
i
will
only
say
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
keep
from
smiling
and
for
a
short
time
i
contemplated
the
profaned
image
saying
to
myself
mother
and
lady
mine
what
a
sight
they
have
made
of
you
as
he
ended
pepe
looked
at
his
hearers
and
although
owing
to
the
gathering
darkness
he
could
not
see
their
countenances
distinctly
he
fancied
that
in
some
of
them
he
perceived
signs
of
angry
consternation
well
senor
don
jose
exclaimed
the
canon
quickly
smiling
with
a
triumphant
expression
that
image
which
to
your
philosophy
and
pantheism
appears
so
ridiculous
is
our
lady
of
help
patroness
and
advocate
of
orbajosa
whose
inhabitants
regard
her
with
so
much
veneration
that
they
would
be
quite
capable
of
dragging
any
one
through
the
streets
who
should
speak
ill
of
her
the
chronicles
and
history
senor
don
jose
are
full
of
the
miracles
which
she
has
wrought
and
even
at
the
present
day
we
receive
constantly
incontrovertible
proofs
of
her
protection
you
must
know
also
that
your
aunt
dona
perfecta
is
chief
lady
in
waiting
to
the
most
holy
virgin
of
help
and
that
the
dress
that
to
you
appears
so
grotesque
went
out
from
this
house
and
that
the
trousers
of
the
infant
are
the
work
of
the
skilful
needle
and
the
ardent
piety
combined
of
your
cousin
rosarito
who
is
now
listening
to
pepe
rey
was
greatly
disconcerted
at
the
same
instant
dona
perfecta
rose
abruptly
from
her
seat
and
without
saying
a
word
walked
toward
the
house
followed
by
the
penitentiary
the
others
rose
also
recovering
from
his
stupefaction
the
young
man
was
about
to
beg
his
cousin
s
pardon
for
his
irreverence
when
he
observed
that
rosarito
was
weeping
fixing
on
her
cousin
a
look
of
friendly
and
gentle
reproof
she
said
what
ideas
you
have
the
voice
of
dona
perfecta
was
heard
crying
in
an
altered
accent
rosario
rosario
the
latter
ran
toward
the
house
chapter
x
the
evidence
of
discord
is
evident
pepe
rey
was
disturbed
and
perplexed
enraged
with
himself
and
every
one
else
he
tried
in
vain
to
imagine
what
could
be
the
conflict
that
had
arisen
in
spite
of
himself
between
his
ideas
and
the
ideas
of
his
aunt
s
friends
thoughtful
and
sad
foreseeing
future
discord
he
remained
for
a
short
time
sitting
on
the
bench
in
the
his
chin
resting
on
his
breast
his
forehead
gathered
in
a
frown
his
hands
clasped
he
thought
himself
alone
suddenly
he
heard
a
gay
voice
humming
the
refrain
of
a
song
from
a
zarzuela
he
looked
up
and
saw
don
jacinto
sitting
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
ah
senor
de
rey
said
the
youth
abruptly
one
does
not
offend
with
impunity
the
religious
sentiments
of
the
great
majority
of
a
nation
if
you
doubt
it
consider
what
happened
in
the
first
french
when
pepe
heard
the
buzzing
of
this
insect
his
irritation
increased
nevertheless
there
was
no
anger
in
his
soul
toward
the
youthful
doctor
of
laws
the
latter
annoyed
him
as
a
fly
might
annoy
him
but
nothing
more
rey
felt
the
irritation
which
every
importunate
being
inspires
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
brushes
away
a
buzzing
drone
he
answered
what
has
the
french
revolution
to
do
with
the
robe
of
the
virgin
he
got
up
and
walked
toward
the
house
but
he
had
not
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
before
he
heard
again
beside
him
the
buzzing
of
the
mosquito
saying
senor
don
jose
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
an
affair
in
which
you
are
greatly
interested
and
which
may
cause
you
some
an
affair
said
the
young
man
drawing
back
let
us
hear
what
affair
is
you
suspect
what
it
is
perhaps
said
jacinto
approaching
pepe
and
smiling
with
the
air
of
a
man
of
business
who
has
some
unusually
important
matter
on
hand
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
the
lawsuit
my
friend
i
have
no
lawsuits
you
as
a
good
lawyer
dream
of
lawsuits
and
see
stamped
paper
what
you
have
not
heard
of
your
lawsuit
exclaimed
the
youth
with
amazement
of
my
lawsuit
but
i
have
no
lawsuits
nor
have
i
ever
had
well
if
you
have
not
heard
of
it
i
am
all
the
better
pleased
to
have
spoken
to
you
about
it
so
that
you
may
be
on
your
guard
yes
senor
you
are
going
to
have
a
suit
at
and
with
whom
with
uncle
licurgo
and
other
whose
property
borders
on
the
estate
called
the
pepe
rey
was
astounded
yes
senor
continued
the
little
lawyer
uncle
licurgo
and
i
had
a
long
conference
as
i
am
such
a
friend
of
the
family
i
wanted
to
let
you
know
about
it
so
that
if
you
think
well
of
it
you
may
hasten
to
arrange
the
but
what
have
i
to
arrange
what
do
those
rascals
claim
from
me
it
seems
that
a
stream
of
water
which
rises
in
your
property
has
changed
its
course
and
flows
over
some
of
the
aforesaid
uncle
licurgo
and
the
mill
of
another
person
occasioning
considerable
damage
my
client
for
he
is
determined
that
i
shall
get
him
out
of
this
difficulty
my
client
as
i
said
demands
that
you
shall
restore
the
water
to
its
former
channel
so
as
to
avoid
fresh
injuries
and
that
you
shall
indemnify
him
for
the
damage
which
his
works
have
already
sustained
through
the
neglect
of
the
superior
and
i
am
the
superior
proprietor
if
i
engage
in
a
lawsuit
that
will
be
the
first
fruit
that
those
famous
poplars
which
were
mine
and
which
now
as
i
understand
belong
to
everybody
will
have
ever
produced
me
for
licurgo
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
farmers
of
the
district
have
been
filching
from
me
little
by
little
year
after
year
pieces
of
land
and
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
the
boundaries
of
my
that
is
a
different
that
is
not
a
different
question
the
real
suit
exclaimed
the
engineer
unable
to
control
his
anger
will
be
the
one
that
i
will
bring
against
that
rabble
who
no
doubt
propose
to
themselves
to
tire
me
out
and
drive
me
to
desperation
so
that
i
may
abandon
every
thing
and
let
them
continue
in
possession
of
what
they
have
stolen
we
shall
see
if
there
are
lawyers
and
judges
who
will
uphold
the
infamous
conduct
of
those
village
legists
who
are
forever
at
law
and
who
waste
and
consume
the
property
of
others
i
am
obliged
to
you
young
gentleman
for
having
informed
me
of
the
villanous
intentions
of
those
boors
who
are
more
perverse
than
satan
himself
when
i
tell
you
that
that
very
and
that
very
mill
on
which
licurgo
bases
his
claim
are
mine
the
of
the
property
ought
to
be
examined
to
see
if
possession
may
not
constitute
a
title
in
this
possession
those
scoundrels
are
not
going
to
have
the
pleasure
of
laughing
at
me
in
that
way
i
suppose
that
justice
is
honestly
and
faithfully
administered
in
the
city
of
oh
as
to
that
exclaimed
the
little
lawyer
with
an
approving
look
the
judge
is
an
excellent
person
he
comes
here
every
evening
but
it
is
strange
that
you
should
have
received
no
notice
of
senor
licurgo
s
claims
have
you
not
yet
been
summoned
to
appear
before
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
it
will
be
then
well
i
am
very
sorry
that
senor
licurgo
s
precipitation
has
deprived
me
of
the
pleasure
and
honor
of
defending
you
but
what
is
to
be
done
licurgo
was
determined
that
i
should
take
him
out
of
his
troubles
i
will
study
the
matter
with
the
greatest
care
this
vile
slavery
is
the
great
drawback
of
pepe
entered
the
in
a
deplorable
state
of
mind
dona
perfecta
was
talking
with
the
penitentiary
as
he
entered
and
rosarito
was
sitting
alone
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
she
was
no
doubt
waiting
for
her
cousin
come
here
you
rascal
said
his
aunt
smiling
with
very
little
spontaneity
you
have
insulted
us
you
great
atheist
but
we
forgive
you
i
am
well
aware
that
my
daughter
and
myself
are
two
rustics
who
are
incapable
of
soaring
to
the
regions
of
mathematics
where
you
dwell
but
for
all
that
it
is
possible
that
you
may
one
day
get
down
on
your
knees
to
us
and
beg
us
to
teach
you
the
christian
pepe
answered
with
vague
phrases
and
formulas
of
politeness
and
repentance
for
my
part
said
don
inocencio
with
an
affected
air
of
meekness
and
amiability
if
in
the
course
of
these
idle
disputes
i
have
said
any
thing
that
could
offend
senor
don
jose
i
beg
his
pardon
for
it
we
are
all
friends
thanks
it
is
of
no
in
spite
of
every
thing
said
dona
perfecta
smiling
with
more
naturalness
than
before
i
shall
always
be
the
same
for
my
dear
nephew
in
spite
of
his
extravagant
and
ideas
in
what
way
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
spend
this
evening
well
in
trying
to
make
uncle
licurgo
give
up
those
obstinate
notions
which
would
otherwise
cause
you
annoyance
i
sent
for
him
and
he
is
waiting
for
me
now
in
the
hall
make
yourself
easy
i
will
arrange
the
matter
for
although
i
know
that
he
is
not
altogether
without
right
on
his
side
thanks
dear
aunt
responded
the
young
man
his
whole
being
invaded
by
a
wave
of
the
generous
emotion
which
was
so
easily
aroused
in
his
soul
pepe
rey
looked
in
the
direction
of
his
cousin
intending
to
join
her
but
some
wily
questions
of
the
canon
retained
him
at
dona
perfecta
s
side
rosario
looked
dejected
and
was
listening
with
an
air
of
melancholy
indifference
to
the
words
of
the
little
lawyer
who
having
installed
himself
at
her
side
kept
up
a
continuous
stream
of
fulsome
flatteries
seasoned
with
jests
and
fatuous
remarks
in
the
worst
possible
taste
the
worst
of
it
is
said
dona
perfecta
to
her
nephew
surprising
the
glance
which
he
cast
in
the
direction
of
the
pair
the
worst
of
it
is
that
you
have
offended
poor
rosario
you
must
do
all
in
your
power
to
make
your
peace
with
her
the
poor
child
is
so
good
oh
yes
so
good
added
the
canon
that
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
will
forgive
her
i
think
that
rosario
has
already
forgiven
me
affirmed
rey
and
if
not
angelic
breasts
do
not
harbor
resentment
long
said
don
inocencio
mellifluously
i
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
with
the
child
and
i
will
endeavor
to
dissipate
in
her
generous
soul
whatever
prejudice
may
exist
there
against
you
as
soon
as
i
say
a
word
or
two
to
her
pepe
rey
felt
a
cloud
darken
his
soul
and
he
said
with
meaning
perhaps
it
may
not
be
i
will
not
speak
to
her
now
added
the
capitular
because
she
is
listening
entranced
to
jacinto
s
nonsense
ah
those
children
when
they
once
begin
there
is
no
stopping
the
judge
of
the
lower
court
the
alcalde
s
lady
and
the
dean
of
the
cathedral
now
made
their
appearance
they
all
saluted
the
engineer
manifesting
in
their
words
and
manner
on
seeing
him
the
satisfaction
of
gratified
curiosity
the
judge
was
one
of
those
clever
and
intelligent
young
men
who
every
day
spring
into
notice
in
official
circles
aspiring
almost
before
they
are
out
of
the
shell
to
the
highest
political
and
administrative
positions
he
gave
himself
airs
of
great
importance
and
in
speaking
of
himself
and
of
his
juvenile
toga
he
seemed
indirectly
to
manifest
great
offence
because
he
had
not
been
all
at
once
made
president
of
the
supreme
court
in
such
inexpert
hands
in
a
brain
thus
swollen
with
vanity
in
this
incarnation
of
conceit
had
the
state
placed
the
most
delicate
and
the
most
difficult
functions
of
human
justice
his
manners
were
those
of
a
perfect
courtier
and
revealed
a
scrupulous
and
minute
attention
to
all
that
concerned
his
own
person
he
had
the
insufferable
habit
of
taking
off
and
putting
on
every
moment
his
gold
and
in
his
conversation
he
manifested
with
frequency
the
strong
desire
which
he
had
to
be
transferred
to
madrid
in
order
that
he
might
give
his
invaluable
services
to
the
department
of
grace
and
justice
the
alcalde
s
lady
was
a
woman
whose
only
weakness
was
to
fancy
that
she
had
a
great
many
acquaintances
at
the
court
she
asked
pepe
rey
various
questions
about
the
fashions
mentioning
establishments
in
which
she
had
had
a
mantle
or
a
skirt
made
on
her
last
journey
to
the
capital
contemporaneous
with
the
visit
of
and
she
also
mentioned
the
names
of
a
dozen
duchesses
and
marchionesses
speaking
of
them
with
as
much
familiarity
as
if
they
had
been
friends
of
her
she
said
also
that
the
countess
of
famous
for
her
parties
was
a
friend
of
hers
and
that
in
she
had
paid
her
a
visit
when
the
countess
had
invited
her
to
her
box
at
the
teatro
real
where
she
saw
in
moorish
dress
and
accompanied
by
his
retinue
of
moors
the
alcalde
s
wife
talked
incessantly
and
was
not
wanting
in
humor
the
dean
was
a
very
old
man
corpulent
and
plethoric
and
apoplectic
looking
a
man
so
obese
that
he
seemed
bursting
out
of
his
skin
he
had
belonged
to
one
of
the
suppressed
religious
orders
he
talked
only
of
religious
matters
and
from
the
very
first
manifested
the
most
profound
contempt
for
pepe
rey
the
latter
appeared
every
moment
more
unable
to
accommodate
himself
to
a
society
so
little
to
his
taste
his
disposition
not
at
all
malleable
hard
and
very
little
flexible
rejected
the
duplicities
and
the
compromises
of
language
to
simulate
concord
when
it
did
not
exist
he
remained
then
very
grave
during
the
whole
of
the
tiresome
evening
obliged
as
he
was
to
endure
the
oratorical
vehemence
of
the
alcalde
s
wife
who
without
being
fame
had
the
privilege
of
fatiguing
with
a
hundred
tongues
the
ears
of
men
if
in
some
brief
respite
which
this
lady
gave
her
hearers
pepe
rey
made
an
attempt
to
approach
his
cousin
the
penitentiary
attached
himself
to
him
instantly
like
the
mollusk
to
the
rock
taking
him
apart
with
a
mysterious
air
to
propose
to
him
an
excursion
with
senor
don
cayetano
to
mundogrande
or
a
fishing
party
on
the
clear
waters
of
the
nahara
at
last
the
evening
came
to
an
end
as
every
thing
does
in
this
world
the
dean
retired
leaving
the
house
as
it
seemed
empty
and
very
soon
there
remained
of
the
alcalde
s
wife
only
an
echo
like
the
buzz
which
remains
in
the
air
after
a
storm
has
passed
away
the
judge
also
deprived
the
company
of
his
presence
and
at
last
don
inocencio
gave
his
nephew
the
signal
for
departure
come
boy
come
for
it
is
late
he
said
smiling
how
you
have
tormented
poor
rosarito
has
he
not
child
home
you
rogue
home
without
it
is
time
to
go
to
bed
said
dona
perfecta
time
to
go
to
work
responded
the
little
lawyer
i
am
always
telling
him
that
he
ought
to
get
through
with
his
business
in
the
but
he
will
not
mind
there
is
so
much
so
very
much
business
to
be
got
no
say
rather
that
confounded
work
which
you
have
undertaken
he
does
not
wish
to
say
it
senor
don
jose
but
the
truth
is
that
he
is
writing
a
book
on
the
influence
of
woman
in
christian
society
and
in
addition
to
that
a
glance
at
the
catholic
movement
in
somewhere
or
other
what
do
you
know
about
glances
or
influences
but
these
youths
of
the
present
day
have
audacity
enough
for
any
thing
oh
what
boys
well
let
us
go
home
senora
dona
perfecta
senor
don
jose
i
will
wait
for
senor
don
cayetano
said
jacinto
to
ask
him
to
give
me
the
augusto
always
carrying
books
why
sometimes
you
come
into
the
house
laden
like
a
donkey
very
well
then
let
us
senor
don
jacinto
does
not
write
hastily
said
pepe
rey
he
prepares
himself
well
for
his
work
so
that
his
books
may
be
treasures
of
but
that
boy
will
injure
his
brain
objected
dona
perfecta
for
heaven
s
sake
be
careful
i
would
set
a
limit
to
his
since
we
are
going
to
wait
said
the
little
doctor
in
a
tone
of
insufferable
conceit
i
will
take
with
me
also
the
third
volume
of
concilios
what
do
you
think
uncle
take
that
of
course
it
would
never
do
to
leave
that
behind
fortunately
senor
don
cayetano
who
generally
spent
his
evenings
at
the
house
of
don
lorenzo
ruiz
soon
arrived
and
the
books
being
received
uncle
and
nephew
left
the
house
rey
read
in
his
cousin
s
sad
countenance
a
keen
desire
to
speak
to
him
he
approached
her
while
dona
perfecta
and
don
cayetano
were
discussing
some
domestic
matter
apart
you
have
offended
mamma
said
rosarito
her
features
expressed
something
like
terror
it
is
true
responded
the
young
man
i
have
offended
your
mamma
i
have
offended
no
not
me
i
already
imagined
that
the
infant
jesus
ought
not
to
wear
but
i
hope
that
you
will
both
forgive
me
your
mamma
was
so
kind
to
me
a
little
while
dona
perfecta
s
voice
suddenly
vibrated
through
the
with
so
discordant
a
tone
that
her
nephew
started
as
if
he
had
heard
a
cry
of
alarm
the
voice
said
imperiously
rosario
go
to
bed
startled
her
mind
filled
with
anxious
fears
the
girl
lingered
in
the
room
going
here
and
there
as
if
she
was
looking
for
something
as
she
passed
her
cousin
she
whispered
softly
and
cautiously
these
words
mamma
is
but
she
is
angry
be
on
your
guard
be
on
your
then
she
left
the
room
her
mother
for
whom
uncle
licurgo
was
waiting
followed
her
and
for
some
time
the
voices
of
dona
perfecta
and
the
countryman
were
heard
mingled
together
in
familiar
conference
pepe
was
left
with
don
cayetano
who
taking
a
light
said
pepe
but
don
t
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
sleep
i
am
going
to
work
but
why
are
you
so
thoughtful
what
is
the
matter
with
you
just
as
i
say
to
work
i
am
making
notes
for
a
memorial
discourse
on
the
genealogies
of
i
have
already
found
data
and
information
of
the
utmost
value
there
can
be
no
dispute
about
it
in
every
period
of
our
history
the
orbajosans
have
been
distinguished
for
their
delicate
sense
of
honor
their
chivalry
their
valor
their
intellectuality
the
conquest
of
mexico
the
wars
of
the
emperor
the
wars
of
philip
against
the
heretics
testify
to
this
but
are
you
ill
what
is
the
matter
with
you
as
i
say
eminent
theologians
valiant
warriors
conquerors
saints
bishops
statesmen
all
sorts
of
illustrious
men
have
flourished
in
this
humble
land
of
the
garlic
no
there
is
not
in
christendom
a
more
illustrious
city
than
ours
its
virtues
and
its
glories
are
in
themselves
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
fill
all
the
pages
of
our
country
s
history
well
i
see
that
it
is
sleepy
you
are
as
i
say
i
would
not
exchange
the
glory
of
being
a
son
of
this
noble
city
for
all
the
gold
in
the
world
augusta
the
ancients
called
it
augustissima
i
call
it
now
for
now
as
then
generosity
valor
magnanimity
are
the
patrimony
of
all
well
dear
pepe
but
i
fancy
you
are
not
well
has
the
supper
disagreed
with
you
alonzo
gonzalez
de
bustamante
was
right
when
he
said
in
his
floresta
amena
that
the
people
of
orbajosa
suffice
in
themselves
to
confer
greatness
and
honor
on
a
kingdom
don
t
you
think
so
oh
yes
senor
undoubtedly
responded
pepe
rey
going
abruptly
toward
his
room
chapter
xi
the
discord
grows
during
the
following
days
pepe
rey
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
of
the
people
of
the
place
he
visited
the
casino
and
formed
friendships
with
some
of
the
individuals
who
spend
their
lives
in
the
rooms
of
that
corporation
but
the
youth
of
orbajosa
did
not
spend
all
their
time
in
the
casino
as
people
might
imagine
in
the
afternoons
there
were
to
be
seen
at
the
corner
of
the
cathedral
and
in
the
little
plaza
formed
by
the
intersection
of
the
calle
del
condestable
and
the
calle
de
la
triperia
several
gentlemen
who
gracefully
enveloped
in
their
cloaks
stood
there
like
sentinels
watching
the
people
as
they
passed
by
if
the
weather
was
fine
those
shining
lights
of
the
urbs
augustan
culture
bent
their
steps
still
enveloped
in
the
indispensable
cloak
toward
the
promenade
called
the
paseo
de
las
descalzas
which
was
formed
by
a
double
row
of
elms
and
some
withered
bushes
of
broom
there
the
brilliant
pleiad
watched
the
daughters
of
this
or
that
who
had
also
come
there
for
a
walk
and
the
afternoon
passed
tolerably
in
the
evening
the
casino
filled
up
again
and
while
some
of
the
members
gave
their
lofty
minds
to
the
delights
of
monte
others
read
the
newspapers
while
the
majority
discussed
in
the
subjects
of
the
various
kinds
such
as
the
politics
horses
bulls
or
the
gossip
of
the
place
the
result
of
every
discussion
was
the
renewed
conviction
of
the
supremacy
of
orbajosa
and
its
inhabitants
over
all
the
other
towns
and
peoples
on
the
face
of
the
earth
these
distinguished
men
were
the
cream
of
the
illustrious
city
some
rich
landowners
others
very
poor
but
all
alike
free
from
lofty
aspirations
they
had
the
imperturbable
tranquillity
of
the
beggar
who
desires
nothing
more
so
long
as
he
has
a
crust
of
bread
with
which
to
cheat
hunger
and
the
sun
to
warm
him
what
chiefly
distinguished
the
orbajosans
of
the
casino
was
a
sentiment
of
bitter
hostility
toward
all
strangers
and
whenever
any
stranger
of
note
appeared
in
its
august
halls
they
believed
that
he
had
come
there
to
call
in
question
the
superiority
of
the
land
of
the
garlic
or
to
dispute
with
it
through
envy
the
incontestable
advantages
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
it
when
pepe
rey
presented
himself
in
the
casino
they
received
him
with
something
of
suspicion
and
as
facetious
persons
abounded
in
it
before
the
new
member
had
been
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
all
sorts
of
jokes
had
been
made
about
him
when
in
answer
to
the
reiterated
questions
of
the
members
he
said
that
he
had
come
to
orbajosa
with
a
commission
to
explore
the
basin
of
the
nahara
for
coal
and
to
survey
a
road
they
all
agreed
that
senor
don
jose
was
a
conceited
fellow
who
wished
to
give
himself
airs
discovering
coalbeds
and
planning
railroads
some
one
added
he
has
come
to
a
bad
place
for
that
then
those
gentlemen
imagine
that
here
we
are
all
fools
and
that
they
can
deceive
us
with
fine
words
he
has
come
to
marry
dona
perfecta
s
daughter
and
all
that
he
says
about
coalbeds
is
only
for
the
sake
of
well
this
morning
said
another
a
merchant
who
had
failed
they
told
me
at
the
dominguez
that
the
gentleman
has
not
a
peseta
and
that
he
has
come
here
in
order
to
be
supported
by
his
aunt
and
to
see
if
he
can
catch
it
seems
that
he
is
no
engineer
at
all
added
an
whose
plantations
were
mortgaged
for
double
their
value
but
it
is
as
you
say
those
starvelings
from
madrid
think
they
are
justified
in
deceiving
poor
provincials
and
as
they
believe
that
here
we
all
wear
tails
it
is
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
is
penniless
well
and
the
whole
earnest
he
told
us
last
night
that
we
were
lazy
that
we
spent
our
time
sunning
ourselves
like
the
that
we
lived
with
the
that
s
it
that
we
lived
with
the
and
that
this
city
was
precisely
like
a
city
in
well
one
has
no
patience
to
listen
to
those
things
where
else
could
he
see
unless
it
might
be
in
paris
a
street
like
the
calle
del
condestable
that
can
show
seven
houses
in
a
row
all
of
them
magnificent
from
dona
perfecta
s
house
to
that
of
nicolasita
hernandez
does
that
fellow
suppose
that
one
has
never
seen
any
thing
or
has
never
been
in
paris
he
also
said
with
a
great
deal
of
delicacy
that
orbajosa
was
a
city
of
beggars
and
he
gave
us
to
understand
that
in
his
opinion
we
live
in
the
meanest
way
here
without
being
ourselves
aware
of
what
insolence
if
he
ever
says
that
to
me
there
will
be
a
scene
in
the
casino
exclaimed
the
collector
of
taxes
why
didn
t
they
tell
him
how
many
arrobas
of
oil
orbajosa
produced
last
year
doesn
t
the
fool
know
that
in
good
years
orbajosa
produces
wheat
enough
to
supply
all
spain
and
even
all
europe
with
bread
it
is
true
that
the
crops
have
been
bad
for
several
years
past
but
that
is
not
the
rule
and
the
crop
of
garlic
i
wager
the
gentleman
doesn
t
know
that
the
garlic
of
orbajosa
made
the
gentleman
of
the
jury
in
the
exposition
of
london
stare
these
and
other
conversations
of
a
similar
kind
were
to
be
heard
in
the
rooms
of
the
casino
in
those
days
notwithstanding
this
boastful
talk
so
common
in
small
towns
which
for
the
very
reason
that
they
are
small
are
generally
arrogant
rey
was
not
without
finding
sincere
friends
among
the
members
of
the
learned
corporation
for
they
were
not
all
gossips
nor
were
there
wanting
among
them
persons
of
good
sense
but
our
hero
had
the
misfortune
if
misfortune
it
can
be
called
to
be
unusually
frank
in
the
manifestation
of
his
feelings
and
this
awakened
some
antipathy
toward
him
days
passed
in
addition
to
the
natural
disgust
which
the
social
customs
of
the
episcopal
city
produced
in
him
various
causes
all
of
them
disagreeable
began
to
develop
in
his
mind
a
profound
sadness
chief
among
these
causes
being
the
crowd
of
litigants
that
swarmed
about
him
like
voracious
ants
many
others
of
the
neighboring
landowners
besides
uncle
licurgo
claimed
damages
from
him
or
asked
him
to
render
accounts
for
lands
managed
by
his
grandfather
a
claim
was
also
brought
against
him
because
of
a
certain
contract
of
partnership
entered
into
by
his
mother
and
which
as
it
appeared
had
not
been
fulfilled
and
he
was
required
in
the
same
way
to
acknowledge
a
mortgage
on
the
estate
of
the
poplars
executed
in
an
irregular
form
by
his
uncle
claims
swarmed
around
him
multiplying
with
rapidity
he
had
come
to
the
determination
to
renounce
the
ownership
of
his
lands
but
meanwhile
his
dignity
required
that
he
should
not
yield
to
the
wily
manoeuvres
of
the
artful
rustics
and
as
the
brought
a
claim
against
him
also
on
account
of
a
pretended
confusion
of
the
boundary
lines
of
his
estate
with
those
of
an
adjoining
wood
belonging
to
the
the
unfortunate
young
man
found
himself
at
every
step
obliged
to
prove
his
rights
which
were
being
continually
called
in
question
his
honor
was
engaged
and
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
defend
his
rights
to
the
death
dona
perfecta
had
promised
in
her
magnanimity
to
help
him
to
free
himself
from
these
disgraceful
plots
by
means
of
an
amicable
arrangement
but
the
days
passed
and
the
good
offices
of
the
exemplary
lady
had
produced
no
result
whatever
the
claims
multiplied
with
the
dangerous
swiftness
of
a
violent
disease
pepe
rey
passed
hour
after
hour
at
court
making
declarations
and
answering
the
same
questions
over
and
over
again
and
when
he
returned
home
tired
and
angry
there
appeared
before
him
the
sharp
features
and
grotesque
face
of
the
notary
who
had
brought
him
a
thick
bundle
of
stamped
papers
full
of
horrible
formulas
that
he
might
be
studying
the
question
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
pepe
rey
was
not
a
man
to
endure
such
annoyances
when
he
might
escape
from
them
by
leaving
the
town
his
mother
s
noble
city
appeared
to
his
imagination
like
a
horrible
monster
which
had
fastened
its
ferocious
claws
in
him
and
was
drinking
his
blood
to
free
himself
from
this
monster
nothing
more
was
necessary
he
believed
than
flight
but
a
weighty
interest
an
interest
in
which
his
heart
was
concerned
kept
him
where
he
was
binding
him
to
the
rock
of
his
martyrdom
with
very
strong
bonds
nevertheless
he
had
come
to
feel
so
dissatisfied
with
his
position
he
had
come
to
regard
himself
as
so
utterly
a
stranger
so
to
say
in
that
gloomy
city
of
lawsuits
of
customs
and
ideas
of
envy
and
of
slander
that
he
resolved
to
leave
it
without
further
delay
without
however
abandoning
the
project
which
had
brought
him
to
it
one
morning
finding
a
favorable
occasion
he
opened
his
mind
to
dona
perfecta
on
this
point
nephew
responded
that
lady
with
her
accustomed
gentleness
don
t
be
rash
why
you
are
like
fire
your
father
was
just
the
same
what
a
man
he
was
you
are
like
a
flash
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
will
be
very
glad
to
call
you
my
son
even
if
you
did
not
possess
the
good
qualities
and
the
talents
which
distinguish
you
in
spite
of
some
little
defects
for
you
have
those
too
even
if
you
were
not
as
good
as
you
are
it
is
enough
that
this
union
has
been
proposed
by
your
father
to
whom
both
my
daughter
and
myself
owe
so
much
for
me
to
accept
it
and
rosarito
will
not
oppose
it
since
i
wish
it
what
is
wanting
then
nothing
there
is
nothing
wanting
but
a
little
time
the
marriage
can
not
be
concluded
with
the
haste
you
desire
and
which
might
perhaps
give
ground
for
interpretations
discreditable
to
my
dear
daughter
s
reputation
but
as
you
think
of
nothing
but
machines
you
want
every
thing
done
by
steam
wait
man
wait
what
hurry
are
you
in
this
hatred
that
you
have
taken
to
our
poor
orbajosa
is
nothing
but
a
caprice
but
of
course
you
can
only
live
among
counts
and
marquises
and
orators
and
diplomats
all
you
want
is
to
get
married
and
separate
me
forever
from
my
daughter
she
added
wiping
away
a
tear
since
that
is
the
case
inconsiderate
boy
at
least
have
the
charity
to
delay
for
a
little
this
marriage
for
which
you
are
so
eager
what
impatience
what
ardent
love
i
did
not
suppose
that
a
poor
country
girl
like
my
daughter
could
inspire
so
violent
a
the
arguments
of
his
aunt
did
not
convince
pepe
rey
but
he
did
not
wish
to
contradict
her
a
fresh
cause
of
anxiety
was
soon
added
to
those
which
already
embittered
his
existence
he
had
now
been
in
orbajosa
for
two
weeks
and
during
that
time
he
had
received
no
letter
from
his
father
this
could
not
be
attributed
to
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
officials
of
the
of
orbajosa
for
the
functionary
who
had
charge
of
that
service
being
the
friend
and
of
dona
perfecta
the
latter
every
day
recommended
him
to
take
the
greatest
care
that
the
letters
addressed
to
her
nephew
did
not
go
astray
the
named
cristoval
ramos
and
nicknamed
caballuco
a
personage
whose
acquaintance
we
have
already
made
also
visited
the
house
and
to
him
dona
perfecta
was
accustomed
to
address
warnings
and
reprimands
as
energetic
as
the
following
a
pretty
mail
service
you
have
how
is
it
that
my
nephew
has
not
received
a
single
letter
since
he
has
been
in
orbajosa
when
the
carrying
of
the
mail
is
entrusted
to
such
a
how
can
things
be
expected
to
go
well
i
will
speak
to
the
governor
of
the
province
so
that
he
may
be
careful
what
kind
of
people
he
puts
in
the
caballuco
shrugging
his
shoulders
looked
at
rey
with
the
most
complete
indifference
one
day
he
entered
the
house
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
thank
heaven
said
dona
perfecta
to
her
nephew
here
are
letters
from
your
father
rejoice
man
a
pretty
fright
we
have
had
through
my
brother
s
laziness
about
writing
what
does
he
say
he
is
well
no
doubt
she
added
seeing
that
pepe
rey
opened
the
letter
with
feverish
impatience
the
engineer
turned
pale
as
he
glanced
over
the
first
lines
good
heavens
pepe
what
is
the
matter
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
rising
in
alarm
is
your
father
ill
this
letter
is
not
from
my
father
responded
pepe
revealing
in
his
countenance
the
greatest
consternation
what
is
it
then
an
order
from
the
minister
of
public
works
relieving
me
from
the
charge
which
was
confided
to
what
can
it
be
possible
a
dismissal
pure
and
simple
expressed
in
terms
very
little
flattering
to
was
there
ever
any
thing
so
unjust
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
when
she
had
recovered
from
her
amazement
what
a
humiliation
exclaimed
the
young
man
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
have
received
an
affront
like
but
the
government
is
unpardonable
to
put
such
a
slight
upon
you
do
you
wish
me
to
write
to
madrid
i
have
very
good
friends
there
and
i
may
be
able
to
obtain
satisfaction
for
you
from
the
government
and
reparation
for
this
brutal
thanks
senora
i
desire
no
recommendations
said
the
young
man
with
but
what
a
piece
of
injustice
what
a
proceeding
to
discharge
in
this
way
a
young
man
of
your
merit
an
eminent
scientist
why
i
can
not
contain
my
anger
i
will
find
out
said
pepe
with
energy
who
it
is
that
occupies
himself
in
injuring
that
minister
but
what
is
to
be
expected
from
those
infamous
politicasters
in
this
there
is
the
hand
of
some
one
who
is
determined
to
drive
me
to
desperation
declared
the
young
man
visibly
disturbed
this
is
not
the
act
of
the
minister
this
and
other
contrarieties
that
i
am
experiencing
are
the
result
of
a
revengeful
plot
of
a
secret
and
plan
of
some
implacable
enemy
and
this
enemy
is
here
in
orbajosa
this
plot
has
been
hatched
in
orbajosa
doubt
it
not
dear
you
are
out
of
your
mind
replied
dona
perfecta
with
a
look
of
compassion
you
have
enemies
in
orbajosa
you
say
some
one
wishes
to
revenge
himself
upon
you
come
pepillo
you
have
lost
your
senses
the
reading
of
those
books
in
which
they
say
that
we
have
for
ancestors
monkeys
or
parrots
has
turned
your
she
smiled
sweetly
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
and
taking
a
tone
of
familiar
and
affectionate
admonition
she
added
my
dear
boy
the
people
of
orbajosa
may
be
rude
and
boorish
rustics
without
learning
or
polish
or
fine
manners
but
in
loyalty
and
good
faith
we
yield
to
no
one
to
no
one
i
say
no
don
t
suppose
said
the
young
man
that
i
accuse
any
one
in
this
house
but
that
my
implacable
and
cruel
enemy
is
in
this
city
i
am
i
wish
you
would
show
me
that
stage
villain
responded
dona
perfecta
smiling
again
i
suppose
you
will
not
accuse
uncle
licurgo
nor
any
of
the
others
who
have
brought
suits
against
you
for
the
poor
people
believe
they
are
only
defending
their
rights
and
between
ourselves
they
are
not
altogether
wanting
in
reason
in
this
case
besides
uncle
licurgo
likes
you
greatly
he
has
told
me
so
himself
from
the
moment
he
saw
you
you
took
his
fancy
and
the
poor
old
man
has
conceived
such
an
affection
for
you
oh
yes
a
profound
affection
murmured
pepe
don
t
be
foolish
continued
his
aunt
putting
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looking
at
him
closely
don
t
imagine
absurdities
convince
yourself
that
your
enemy
if
you
have
one
is
in
madrid
in
that
centre
of
corruption
of
envy
and
rivalry
not
in
this
peaceful
and
tranquil
corner
where
all
is
and
concord
some
one
no
doubt
who
is
envious
of
your
merit
there
is
one
thing
i
wish
to
say
now
and
that
is
that
if
you
desire
to
go
there
to
learn
the
cause
of
this
affront
and
ask
an
explanation
of
it
from
the
government
you
must
not
neglect
doing
so
on
our
pepe
rey
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
aunt
s
countenance
as
if
he
wished
to
penetrate
with
his
glance
the
inmost
depths
of
her
soul
i
say
that
if
you
wish
to
go
do
so
repeated
dona
perfecta
with
admirable
serenity
while
her
countenance
expressed
the
most
complete
and
unaffected
sincerity
no
senora
i
do
not
wish
to
so
much
the
better
i
think
you
are
right
you
are
more
tranquil
here
notwithstanding
the
suspicions
with
which
you
are
tormenting
yourself
poor
pepillo
we
poor
rustics
of
orbajosa
live
happy
in
our
ignorance
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
not
contented
here
but
is
it
my
fault
if
you
vex
and
worry
yourself
without
a
cause
do
i
not
treat
you
like
a
son
have
i
not
received
you
as
the
hope
of
my
house
can
i
do
more
for
you
if
in
spite
of
all
this
you
do
not
like
us
if
you
show
so
much
indifference
toward
us
if
you
ridicule
our
piety
if
you
insult
our
friends
is
it
by
chance
because
we
do
not
treat
you
well
dona
perfecta

eyes
grew
moist
my
dear
aunt
said
pepe
feeling
his
anger
vanish
i
too
have
committed
some
faults
since
i
have
been
a
guest
in
this
don
t
be
foolish
don
t
talk
about
committing
faults
among
the
persons
of
the
same
family
every
thing
is
but
rosarito
where
is
she
asked
the
young
man
rising
am
i
not
to
see
her
either
she
is
better
do
you
know
that
she
did
not
wish
to
come
down
stairs
i
will
go
up
to
her
no
it
would
be
of
no
use
that
girl
has
some
obstinate
notions
she
is
determined
not
to
leave
her
room
she
has
locked
herself
what
a
strange
idea
she
will
get
over
it
undoubtedly
she
will
get
over
it
we
will
see
if
we
can
not
put
these
melancholy
thoughts
out
of
her
head
we
will
get
up
a
party
to
amuse
her
why
don
t
you
go
to
don
inocencio
s
and
ask
him
to
come
here
and
bring
jacintillo
with
him
jacintillo
yes
when
rosarito
has
these
fits
of
melancholy
the
only
one
who
can
divert
her
is
that
young
but
i
will
go
upstairs
no
you
must
what
etiquette
there
is
in
this
house

are
ridiculing

as
i
ask
but
i
wish

you
can
not
see
her
how
little
you
know
the
girl
i
thought
i
knew
her
well
i
will
stay
here
then
but
this
solitude
is
there
comes
the
maledictions
upon
him
and
i
think
the
has
just
come
in
too
he
is
an
excellent
he
be
hanged
with
his
goodness
but
business
affairs
when
they
are
one

own
serve
as
a
distraction
some
one
is
coming
i
think
it
is
the
agricultural
expert
you
will
have
something
to
occupy
you
now
for
an
hour
or
an
hour
or
two
of
hell
ah
ha
if
i
am
not
mistaken
uncle
licurgo
and
uncle

just

perhaps
they
have
come
to
propose
a
compromise
to

would
throw
myself
into
the
pond
first
how
unnatural
you
are
for
they
are
all
very
fond
of
you
well
so
that
nothing
may
be
wanting
there
comes
the
constable
too
he
is
coming
to
serve
a
summons
on
to
crucify

exhaled
a
deep
sigh
and
gave
himself
up
he
gave
himself
up

and

to
the
executioners

brandished
horrible

of

chapter

here
was
troy
love
friendship
a
wholesome
moral
atmosphere
spiritual
light
sympathy
an
easy
interchange
of
ideas
and
feelings
these
were
what
pepe
rey
s
nature
imperatively
demanded
deprived
of
them
the
darkness
that
shrouded
his
soul
grew
deeper
and
his
inward
gloom
imparted
a
tinge
of
bitterness
and
discontent
to
his
manner
on
the
day
following
the
scenes
described
in
the
last
chapter
what
vexed
him
more
than
any
thing
was
the
already
prolonged
and
mysterious
seclusion
of
his
cousin
accounted
for
at
first
by
a
trifling
indisposition
and
then
by
caprices
and
nervous
feelings
difficult
of
explanation
rey
was
surprised
by
conduct
so
contrary
to
the
idea
which
he
had
formed
of
rosarito
four
days
had
passed
during
which
he
had
not
seen
her
and
certainly
it
was
not
because
he
did
not
desire
to
be
at
her
side
and
his
situation
threatened
soon
to
become
humiliating
and
ridiculous
if
by
boldly
taking
the
initiative
he
did
not
at
once
put
an
end
to
it
shall
i
not
see
my
cousin
either
he
said
to
his
aunt
with
manifest
when
they
had
finished
dining
no
not
either
heaven
knows
how
sorry
i
am
for
it
i
gave
her
a
good
talking
to
this
morning
this
afternoon
we
will
see
what
can
be
the
suspicion
that
in
this
unreasonable
seclusion
his
adorable
cousin
was
rather
the
helpless
victim
than
the
free
and
willing
agent
induced
him
to
control
himself
and
to
wait
had
it
not
been
for
this
suspicion
he
would
have
left
orbajosa
that
very
day
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
rosario
loved
him
but
it
was
evident
that
some
unknown
influence
was
at
work
to
separate
them
and
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
part
of
an
honorable
man
to
discover
whence
that
malign
influence
proceeded
and
to
oppose
it
as
far
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
so
i
hope
that
rosarito
s
obstinacy
will
not
continue
long
he
said
to
dona
perfecta
disguising
his
real
sentiments
on
this
day
he
received
a
letter
from
his
father
in
which
the
latter
complained
of
having
received
none
from
orbajosa
a
circumstance
which
increased
the
engineer
s
disquietude
perplexing
him
still
further
finally
after
wandering
about
alone
in
the
garden
for
a
long
time
he
left
the
house
and
went
to
the
casino
he
entered
it
with
the
desperate
air
of
a
man
about
to
throw
himself
into
the
sea
in
the
principal
rooms
he
found
various
people
talking
and
discussing
different
subjects
in
one
group
they
were
solving
with
subtle
logic
difficult
problems
relating
to
bulls
in
another
they
were
discussing
the
relative
merits
of
different
breeds
of
donkeys
of
orbajosa
and
villahorrenda
bored
to
the
last
degree
pepe
rey
turned
away
from
these
discussions
and
directed
his
steps
toward
the
where
he
looked
through
various
reviews
without
finding
any
distraction
in
the
reading
and
a
little
later
passing
from
room
to
room
he
stopped
without
knowing
why
at
the
for
nearly
two
hours
he
remained
in
the
clutches
of
the
horrible
yellow
demon
whose
shining
eyes
of
gold
at
once
torture
and
charm
but
not
even
the
excitement
of
play
had
power
to
lighten
the
gloom
of
his
soul
and
the
same
tedium
which
had
impelled
him
toward
the
green
cloth
sent
him
away
from
it
shunning
the
noise
he
found
himself
in
an
apartment
used
as
an
in
which
at
the
time
there
was
not
a
living
soul
and
here
he
seated
himself
wearily
at
a
window
overlooking
the
street
this
was
very
narrow
with
more
corners
and
salient
angles
than
houses
and
was
overshaded
throughout
its
whole
extent
by
the
imposing
mass
of
the
cathedral
that
lifted
its
dark
and
walls
at
one
end
of
it
pepe
rey
looked
up
and
down
and
in
every
direction
no
sign
of
life
not
a
footstep
not
a
voice
not
a
glance
disturbed
the
stillness
peaceful
as
that
of
a
tomb
that
reigned
everywhere
suddenly
strange
sounds
like
the
whispering
of
feminine
voices
fell
on
his
ear
and
then
the
rustling
of
curtains
that
were
being
drawn
a
few
words
and
finally
the
humming
of
a
song
the
bark
of
a
and
other
signs
of
social
life
which
seemed
very
strange
in
such
a
place
observing
attentively
pepe
rey
perceived
that
these
noises
proceeded
from
an
enormous
balcony
with
blinds
which
displayed
its
corpulent
bulk
in
front
of
the
window
at
which
he
was
sitting
before
he
had
concluded
his
observations
a
member
of
the
casino
suddenly
appeared
beside
him
and
accosted
him
laughingly
in
this
manner
ah
senor
don
pepe
what
a
rogue
you
are
so
you
have
shut
yourself
in
here
to
ogle
the
girls
eh
the
speaker
was
don
juan
tafetan
a
very
amiable
man
and
one
of
the
few
members
of
the
casino
who
had
manifested
for
pepe
rey
cordial
friendship
and
genuine
admiration
with
his
red
cheeks
his
little
dyed
mustache
his
restless
laughing
eyes
his
insignificant
figure
his
hair
carefully
combed
to
hide
his
baldness
don
juan
tafetan
was
far
from
being
an
antinous
in
appearance
but
he
was
very
witty
and
very
agreeable
and
he
had
a
happy
gift
for
telling
a
good
story
he
was
much
given
to
laughter
and
when
he
laughed
his
face
from
his
forehead
to
his
chin
became
one
mass
of
grotesque
wrinkles
in
spite
of
these
qualities
and
of
the
applause
which
might
have
stimulated
his
taste
for
spicy
jokes
he
was
not
a
every
one
liked
him
and
pepe
rey
spent
with
him
many
pleasant
hours
poor
tafetan
formerly
an
employe
in
the
civil
department
of
the
government
of
the
capital
of
the
province
now
lived
modestly
on
his
salary
as
a
clerk
in
the
bureau
of
charities
eking
out
his
income
by
gallantly
playing
the
clarionet
in
the
processions
in
the
solemnities
of
the
cathedral
and
in
the
theatre
whenever
some
desperate
company
of
players
made
their
appearance
in
those
parts
with
the
perfidious
design
of
giving
representations
in
orbajosa
but
the
most
curious
thing
about
don
juan
tafetan
was
his
liking
for
pretty
girls
he
himself
in
the
days
when
he
did
not
hide
his
baldness
with
half
a
dozen
hairs
plastered
down
with
pomade
when
he
did
not
dye
his
mustache
when
in
the
freedom
from
care
of
youthful
years
he
walked
with
shoulders
unstooped
and
head
erect
had
been
a
formidable
to
hear
him
recount
his
conquests
was
something
to
make
one
die
laughing
for
there
are
and
and
he
was
one
of
the
most
original
what
girls
i
don
t
see
any
girls
responded
pepe
rey
yes
play
the
anchorite
one
of
the
blinds
of
the
balcony
was
opened
giving
a
glimpse
of
a
youthful
face
lovely
and
smiling
that
disappeared
instantly
like
a
light
extinguished
by
the
wind
yes
i
see
don
t
you
know
them
on
my
life
i
do
they
are
the
troyas
the
troya
girls
then
you
don
t
know
something
good
three
lovely
girls
the
daughters
of
a
colonel
of
staff
who
died
in
the
streets
of
madrid
in
the
blind
opened
again
and
two
faces
appeared
they
are
laughing
at
me
said
tafetan
making
a
friendly
sign
to
the
girls
do
you
know
them
why
of
course
i
know
them
the
poor
things
are
in
the
greatest
want
i
don
t
know
how
they
manage
to
live
when
don
francisco
troya
died
a
subscription
was
raised
for
them
but
that
did
not
last
very
poor
girls
i
imagine
they
are
not
models
of
and
why
not
i
do
not
believe
what
they
say
in
the
town
about
once
more
the
blinds
opened
girls
cried
don
juan
tafetan
to
the
three
girls
who
appeared
artistically
grouped
at
the
window
this
gentleman
says
that
good
things
ought
not
to
hide
themselves
and
that
you
should
throw
open
the
but
the
blind
was
closed
and
a
joyous
concert
of
laughter
diffused
a
strange
gayety
through
the
gloomy
street
one
might
have
fancied
that
a
flock
of
birds
was
passing
shall
we
go
there
said
tafetan
suddenly
his
eyes
sparkled
and
a
roguish
smile
played
on
his
discolored
lips
but
what
sort
of
people
are
they
then
don
t
be
afraid
senor
de
rey
the
poor
things
are
honest
bah
why
they
live
upon
air
like
the
chameleons
tell
me
can
any
one
who
doesn
t
eat
sin
the
poor
girls
are
virtuous
enough
and
even
if
they
did
sin
they
fast
enough
to
make
up
for
let
us
go
a
moment
later
don
juan
tafetan
and
pepe
rey
were
entering
the
parlor
of
the
troyas
the
poverty
he
saw
that
struggled
desperately
to
disguise
itself
afflicted
the
young
man
the
three
girls
were
very
lovely
especially
the
two
younger
ones
who
were
pale
and
dark
with
large
black
eyes
and
slender
figures
and
well
shod
they
would
have
seemed
the
daughters
of
a
duchess
and
worthy
to
ally
themselves
with
princes
when
the
visitors
entered
the
three
girls
were
for
a
moment
abashed
but
very
soon
their
naturally
gay
and
frivolous
dispositions
became
apparent
they
lived
in
poverty
as
birds
live
in
confinement
singing
behind
iron
bars
as
they
would
sing
in
the
midst
of
the
abundance
of
the
forest
they
spent
the
day
sewing
which
showed
at
least
honorable
principles
but
no
one
in
orbajosa
of
their
own
station
in
life
held
any
intercourse
with
them
they
were
to
a
certain
extent
proscribed
looked
down
upon
avoided
which
also
showed
that
there
existed
some
cause
for
scandal
but
to
be
just
it
must
be
said
that
the
bad
reputation
of
the
troyas
consisted
more
than
in
any
thing
else
in
the
name
they
had
of
being
gossips
and
fond
of
playing
practical
jokes
and
bold
and
free
in
their
manners
they
wrote
anonymous
letters
to
grave
personages
they
gave
nicknames
to
every
living
being
in
orbajosa
from
the
bishop
down
to
the
lowest
vagabond
they
threw
pebbles
at
the
they
hissed
behind
the
window
bars
in
order
to
amuse
themselves
with
the
perplexity
and
annoyance
of
the
startled
they
found
out
every
thing
that
occurred
in
the
neighborhood
to
which
end
they
made
constant
use
of
every
window
and
aperture
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
they
sang
at
night
in
the
balcony
they
masked
themselves
during
the
carnival
in
order
to
obtain
entrance
into
the
houses
of
the
highest
families
and
they
played
many
other
mischievous
pranks
peculiar
to
small
towns
but
whatever
its
cause
the
fact
was
that
on
the
troya
triumvirate
rested
one
of
those
stigmas
that
once
affixed
on
any
one
by
a
susceptible
community
accompanies
that
person
implacably
even
beyond
the
tomb
this
is
the
gentleman
they
say
has
come
to
discover
the
said
one
of
the
girls
and
to
do
away
with
the
cultivation
of
garlic
in
orbajosa
to
plant
cotton
or
cinnamon
trees
in
its
stead
pepe
could
not
help
laughing
at
these
absurdities
all
he
has
come
for
is
to
make
a
collection
of
pretty
girls
to
take
back
with
him
to
madrid
said
tafetan
ah
i
ll
be
very
glad
to
go
cried
one
i
will
take
the
three
of
you
with
me
said
pepe
but
i
want
to
know
one
thing
why
were
you
laughing
at
me
when
i
was
at
the
window
of
the
casino
these
words
were
the
signal
for
fresh
bursts
of
laughter
these
girls
are
silly
things
said
the
eldest
it
was
because
we
said
you
deserved
something
better
than
dona
perfecta
s
it
was
because
this
one
said
that
you
are
only
losing
your
time
for
rosarito
cares
only
for
people
connected
with
the
how
absurd
you
are
i
said
nothing
of
the
kind
it
was
you
who
said
that
the
gentleman
was
a
lutheran
atheist
and
that
he
enters
the
cathedral
smoking
and
with
his
hat
well
i
didn
t
invent
it
that
is
what
suspiritos
told
me
and
who
is
this
suspiritos
who
says
such
absurd
things
about
me
suspiritos
is
girls
said
tafetan
with
smiling
countenance
there
goes
the
call
him
i
want
to
invite
you
to
eat
one
of
the
girls
called
the
the
conversation
started
by
the
troyas
displeased
pepe
rey
not
a
little
dispelling
the
slight
feeling
of
contentment
which
he
had
experienced
at
finding
himself
in
such
gay
and
communicative
company
he
could
not
however
refrain
from
smiling
when
he
saw
don
juan
tafetan
take
down
a
guitar
and
begin
to
play
upon
it
with
all
the
grace
and
skill
of
his
youthful
years
i
have
been
told
that
you
sing
beautifully
said
rey
to
the
girls
let
don
juan
tafetan
i
don
t
nor
i
said
the
second
of
the
girls
offering
the
engineer
some
pieces
of
the
skin
of
the
orange
she
had
just
peeled
maria
juana
don
t
leave
your
sewing
said
the
eldest
of
the
troyas
it
is
late
and
the
cassock
must
be
finished
there
is
to
be
no
work
to
the
devil
with
the
needles
exclaimed
tafetan
and
he
began
to
sing
a
song
the
people
are
stopping
in
the
street
said
the
second
of
the
girls
going
out
on
the
balcony
don
juan
tafetan
s
shouts
can
be
heard
in
the
plaza
juana
juana
well
suspiritos
is
walking
down
the
throw
a
piece
of
at
pepe
rey
looked
out
also
he
saw
a
lady
walking
down
the
street
at
whom
the
youngest
of
the
troyas
taking
a
skilful
aim
threw
a
large
piece
of
which
struck
her
straight
on
the
back
of
the
head
then
they
hastily
closed
the
blinds
and
the
three
girls
tried
to
stifle
their
laughter
so
that
it
might
not
be
heard
in
the
street
there
is
no
work
cried
one
overturning
the
with
the
tip
of
her
shoe
that
is
the
same
as
saying
there
is
to
be
no
eating
said
the
eldest
gathering
up
the
sewing
implements
pepe
rey
instinctively
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
would
gladly
have
given
them
an
alms
the
spectacle
of
these
poor
orphans
condemned
by
the
world
because
of
their
frivolity
saddened
him
beyond
measure
if
the
only
sin
of
the
troyas
if
the
only
pleasure
which
they
had
to
compensate
them
for
solitude
poverty
and
neglect
was
to
throw
at
the
they
might
well
be
excused
for
doing
it
the
austere
customs
of
the
town
in
which
they
lived
had
perhaps
preserved
them
from
vice
but
the
unfortunate
girls
lacked
decorum
and
the
common
and
most
visible
signs
of
modesty
and
it
might
easily
be
supposed
that
they
had
thrown
out
of
the
window
something
more
than
pepe
rey
felt
profound
pity
for
them
he
noted
their
shabby
dresses
made
over
mended
trimmed
and
retrimmed
to
make
them
look
like
new
he
noted
their
broken
shoes
and
once
more
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
vice
may
reign
here
he
said
to
himself
but
the
faces
the
furniture
all
show
that
this
is
the
wreck
of
a
respectable
family
if
these
poor
girls
were
as
bad
as
it
is
said
they
are
they
would
not
live
in
such
poverty
and
they
would
not
work
in
orbajosa
there
are
rich
the
three
girls
went
back
and
forward
between
him
and
the
window
keeping
up
a
gay
and
sprightly
conversation
which
indicated
it
must
be
said
a
species
of
innocence
in
the
midst
of
all
their
frivolity
and
unconventionality
senor
don
jose
what
an
excellent
lady
dona

is
she

the
only
person
in
orbajosa
who
is
not
spoken
ill
every
one
respects
every
one
adores
to
these
utterances
the
young
man
responded
by
praises
of
his
aunt
but
he
had
no
longer
any
inclination
to
take
money
from
his
pocket
and
say
maria
juana
take
this
for
a
pair
of
pepa
take
this
to
buy
a

for

take
this
to
provide
yourself
with

provisions
as
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
doing
at
a
moment
when
the
three
girls
had
run
out
to
the
balcony
to
see
who
was
passing
don
juan
tafetan
approached
rey
and
whispered
to
him
how
pretty
they
are
are
they
not
poor
things
it
seems
impossible
that
they
should
be
so
gay
when
it
may
be
positively
affirmed
that
they
have
not
dined

don

don

so
that
you
may
know
this
type
he
called
pepe

availing
himself
of
the
moment
in
which
the
three
girls
and
don
juan
were
making
merry
in
the
balcony
calling
nicolasito
hernandez
the
nickname
which
so
greatly
enraged
him
stepped
cautiously
to
one
of
the
sewing
baskets
in
the
room
and
placed
in
it
a
half
ounce
which
he
had
left
after
his
losses
at
play
then
he
hurried
out
to
the
balcony
just
as
the
two
youngest
cried
in
the
midst
of
wild
bursts
of
laughter

a
casus
belli
after
this
prank
the
troyas
commenced
a
conversation
with
their
visitors
about
the
people
and
the
affairs
of
the
town
the
engineer
fearing
that
his
exploit
might
be
discovered
while
he
was
present
wished
to
go
which
displeased
the
troyas
greatly
one
of
them
who
had
left
the
room
now
returned
saying
suspiritos
is
now
in
the
yard
she
is
hanging
out
the
don
jose
will
wish
to
see
her
said
another
of
the
girls
she
is
a
woman
and
now
she
arranges
her
hair
in
the
madrid
fashion
come
all
of
they
took
their
visitors
to
the
an
apartment
very
little
used
which
opened
on
a
terrace
where
there
were
a
few
flowers
in
pots
and
many
broken
and
disused
articles
of
furniture
the
terrace
overlooked
the
yard
of
an
adjoining
house
with
a
piazza
full
of
green
vines
and
plants
in
pots
carefully
cultivated
every
thing
about
it
showed
it
to
be
the
abode
of
neat
and
industrious
people
of
modest
means
the
troyas
approaching
the
edge
of
the
roof
looked
attentively
at
the
neighboring
house
and
then
imposing
silence
by
a
gesture
on
their
cavaliers
retreated
to
a
part
of
the
terrace
from
which
they
could
not
see
into
the
yard
and
where
there
was
no
danger
of
their
being
seen
from
it
she
is
coming
out
of
the
kitchen
now
with
a
pan
of
peas
said
maria
juana
stretching
out
her
neck
to
look
there
goes
cried
another
throwing
a
pebble
into
the
yard
the
noise
of
the
projectile
striking
against
the
glass
of
the
piazza
was
heard
and
then
an
angry
voice
crying
now
they
have
broken
another
pane
of
glass
the
girls
hidden
close
beside
the
two
men
in
a
corner
of
the
terrace
were
suffocating
with
laughter
senora
suspiritos
is
very
angry
said
rey
why
do
they
call
her
by
that
name
because
when
she
is
talking
she
sighs
after
every
word
and
although
she
has
every
thing
she
wants
she
is
always
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
in
the
house
below

cautiously
down
there
she
comes
again

whispered
once
more

by
a
gesture

masculine
exclamation

a

struck
senor
don
inocencio
on
the
the
penitentiary

pepe
rey
does

live
in
that
house
why
where
else
should
he
live
and
the
lady
of
the
sighs
is
his
niece
his
housekeeper
or
whatever
else
she
may
be
we
amuse
ourselves
with
her
because
she
is
very
tiresome
but
we
are
not
accustomed
to
play
tricks
on
his
reverence
the
while
this
dialogue
was
being
rapidly
carried
on
pepe
rey
saw
in
front
of
the
terrace
and
very
near
him
a
window
belonging
to
the
bombarded
house
open
he
saw
a
smiling
face
appear
at
it
a
familiar
face
a
face
the
sight
of
which
stunned
him
terrified
him
made
him
turn
pale
and
tremble
it
was
that
of
jacinto
who
interrupted
in
his
grave
studies
appeared
at
it
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
his
modest
fresh
and
smiling
countenance
appearing
in
this
way
had
an
auroral
aspect
senor
don
jose
he
said
gayly
jacinto
jacinto
i
say
i
am
coming
i
was
saluting
a
come
away
come
away
cried
florentina
in
alarm
the
penitentiary
is
going
up
to
don
nominative
s
room
and
he
will
give
us
a
yes
come
away
let
us
close
the
door
of
the
they
rushed
from
the
terrace
you
might
have
guessed
that
jacinto
would
see
you
from
his
temple
of
learning
said
tafetan
to
the
troyas
don
nominative
is
our
friend
responded
one
of
the
girls
from
his
temple
of
science
he
says
a
great
many
sweet
things
to
us
on
the
sly
and
he
blows
us
kisses
jacinto
asked
the
engineer
what
the
deuce
is
that
name
you
gave
him
don
the
three
girls
burst
out
laughing
we
call
him
that
because
he
is
very
no
because
when
we
were
little
he
was
little
too
but
yes
now
i
remember
we
used
to
play
on
the
terrace
and
we
could
hear
him
studying
his
lessons
yes
and
the
whole
blessed
day
he
used
to
spend
declining
girl
that
is
what
it
was
he
would
go
like
this
nominative
rosa
genitive
dative
i
suppose
that
i
have
my
nickname
too
said
pepe
rey
let
maria
juana
tell
you
what
it
is
said
florentina
hiding
herself
i
tell
it
to
him
you
you
haven
t
any
name
yet
don
but
i
shall
have
one
i
promise
you
that
i
will
come
to
hear
what
it
is
and
to
receive
confirmation
said
the
young
man
making
a
movement
to
go
what
are
you
going
yes
you
have
lost
time
enough
already
to
work
girls
throwing
stones
at
the
neighbors
and
the
is
not
the
most
suitable
occupation
for
girls
as
pretty
and
as
clever
as
you
are
well
and
without
waiting
for
further
remonstrances
or
answering
the
civilities
of
the
girls
he
left
the
house
hastily
leaving
don
juan
tafetan
behind
him
the
scene
which
he
had
just
witnessed
the
indignity
suffered
by
the
canon
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
little
doctor
of
laws
added
still
further
to
the
perplexities
the
anxieties
and
the
disagreeable
presentiments
that
already
disturbed
the
soul
of
the
unlucky
engineer
he
regretted
with
his
whole
soul
having
entered
the
house
of
the
troyas
and
resolving
to
employ
his
time
better
while
his
hypochondriasm
lasted
he
made
a
tour
of
inspection
through
the
town
he
visited
the
market
the
calle
de
la
triperia
where
the
principal
stores
were
he
observed
the
various
aspects
presented
by
the
industry
and
commerce
of
the
great
city
of
orbajosa
and
finding
only
new
motives
of
weariness
he
bent
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
paseo
de
las
descalzas
but
he
saw
there
only
a
few
stray
dogs
for
owing
to
the
disagreeable
wind
which
prevailed
the
usual
promenaders
had
remained
at
home
he
went
to
the
apothecary
s
where
various
species
of
ruminant
friends
of
progress
who
chewed
again
and
again
the
cud
of
the
same
endless
theme
were
accustomed
to
meet
but
there
he
was
still
more
bored
finally
as
he
was
passing
the
cathedral
he
heard
the
strains
of
the
organ
and
the
beautiful
chanting
of
the
choir
he
entered
knelt
before
the
high
altar
remembering
the
warnings
which
his
aunt
had
given
him
about
behaving
with
decorum
in
church
then
visited
a
chapel
and
was
about
to
enter
another
when
an
acolyte
warden
or
beadle
approached
him
and
with
the
rudest
manner
and
in
the
most
discourteous
tone
said
to
him
his
lordship
says
that
you
are
to
get
out
of
the
the
engineer
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
he
obeyed
without
a
word
turned
out
everywhere
either
by
superior
authority
or
by
his
own
tedium
he
had
no
resource
but
to
return
to
his
aunt
s
house
where
he
found
waiting
for
him
first
uncle
licurgo
to
announce
a
second
lawsuit
to
him
second
senor
don
cayetano
to
read
him
another
passage
from
his
discourse
on
the
genealogies
of
orbajosa
third
caballuco
on
some
business
which
he
had
not
disclosed
fourth
dona

and
her
affectionate
smile
for
what
will
appear
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
xiv
the
discord
continues
to
increase
a
fresh
attempt
to
see
his
cousin
that
evening
failed
and
pepe
rey
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
to
write
several
letters
his
mind
preoccupied
with
one
thought
or
he
said
to
himself
this
will
end
one
way
or
when
he
was
called
to
supper
dona

who
was
already
in
the

up
to
him
and
said
without
preface

that

girls

any
i
have
done
nothing
to

the
only
thing

and
beat

i
don

than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
no
one
spoke
don
cayetano
dona
perfecta
and
pepe
rey
ate
in
silence
this
was
interrupted
when
don
inocencio
entered
the
how
sorry
i
was
for
it
my
dear
don
jose
believe
me
i
was
truly
sorry
for
it
he
said
pressing
the
young
man
s
hand
and
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
compassion
the
engineer
was
so
perplexed
for
a
moment
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
answer
i
refer
to
the
occurrence
of
this
ah
yes
to
your
expulsion
from
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
the
bishop
should
consider
well
said
pepe
rey
before
he
turns
a
christian
out
of
the
that
is
very
true
i
don
t
know
who
can
have
put
it
into
his
lordship
s
head
that
you
are
a
man
of
very
bad
habits
i
don
t
know
who
has
told
him
that
you
make
a
boast
of
your
atheism
everywhere
that
you
ridicule
sacred
things
and
persons
and
even
that
you
are
planning
to
pull
down
the
cathedral
to
build
a
large
tar
factory
with
the
stones
i
tried
my
best
to
dissuade
him
but
his
lordship
is
a
little
thanks
for
so
much
and
it
is
not
because
the
penitentiary
has
any
reason
to
show
you
these
considerations
a
little
more
and
they
would
have
left
him
stretched
on
the
ground
this
bah
said
the
ecclesiastic
laughing
but
have
you
heard
of
that
little
prank
already
i
wager
maria
remedios
came
with
the
story
and
i
forbade
her
to
do
it
i
forbade
her
positively
the
thing
in
itself
is
of
no
consequence
am
i
not
right
senor
de
rey
since
you
think
so
that
is
what
i
think
young
people
s
pranks
youth
let
the
moderns
say
what
they
will
is
inclined
to
vice
and
to
vicious
actions
senor
de
rey
who
is
a
person
of
great
endowments
could
not
be
altogether
perfect
why
should
it
be
wondered
at
that
those
pretty
girls
should
have
captivated
him
and
after
getting
his
money
out
of
him
should
have
made
him
the
accomplice
of
their
shameless
and
criminal
insults
to
their
neighbors
my
dear
friend
for
the
painful
part
that
i
had
in
this
afternoon
s
sport
he
added
raising
his
hand
to
the
wounded
spot
i
am
not
offended
nor
will
i
distress
you
by
even
referring
to
so
disagreeable
an
incident
i
am
truly
sorry
to
hear
that
maria
remedios
came
here
to
tell
all
about
it
my
niece
is
so
fond
of
gossiping
i
wager
she
told
too
about
the
half
ounce
and
your
romping
with
the
girls
on
the
terrace
and
your
chasing
one
another
about
and
the
pinches
and
the
capers
of
don
juan
tafetan
bah
those
things
ought
not
to
be
pepe
rey
did
not
know
which
annoyed
him
most
his
aunt
s
severity
or
the
hypocritical
condescension
of
the
canon
why
should
they
not
be
told
said
dona
perfecta
he
does
not
seem
ashamed
of
his
conduct
himself
i
assure
you
all
that
i
keep
this
from
my
dear
daughter
only
because
in
her
nervous
condition
a
fit
of
anger
might
be
dangerous
to
come
it
is
not
so
serious
as
all
that
senora
said
the
penitentiary
i
think
the
matter
should
not
be
again
referred
to
and
when
the
one
who
was
stoned
says
that
the
rest
may
surely
be
satisfied
and
the
blow
was
no
joke
senor
don
jose
i
thought
they
had
split
my
head
open
and
that
my
brains
were
oozing
i
am
truly
sorry
for
the
occurrence
stammered
pepe
rey
it
gives
me
real
pain
although
i
had
no
part
in
it
your
visit
to
those
senoras
troyas
will
be
talked
about
all
over
the
town
said
the
canon
we
are
not
in
madrid
in
that
centre
of
corruption
of
scandal
there
you
can
visit
the
vilest
places
without
any
one
knowing
it
said
dona
perfecta
here
we
are
very
observant
of
one
another
continued
don
inocencio
we
take
notice
of
everything
our
neighbors
do
and
with
such
a
system
of
vigilance
public
morals
are
maintained
at
a
proper
height
believe
me
my
friend
believe
me
and
i
do
not
say
this
to
mortify
you
you
are
the
first
gentleman
of
your
position
who
in
the
light
of
day
the
first
yes
senor
qui
primus
ab
and
bursting
into
a
laugh
he
clapped
the
engineer
on
the
back
in
token
of
amity
and
how
grateful
i
ought
to
be
said
the
young
man
concealing
his
anger
under
the
sarcastic
words
which
he
thought
the
most
suitable
to
answer
the
covert
irony
of
his
interlocutors
to
meet
with
so
much
generosity
and
tolerance
when
my
criminal
conduct
would
deserve
what
is
a
person
of
one
s
own
blood
one
who
bears
one
s
name
said
dona
perfecta
to
be
treated
like
a
stranger
you
are
my
nephew
you
are
the
son
of
the
best
and
the
most
virtuous
of
men
of
my
dear
brother
juan
and
that
is
sufficient
yesterday
afternoon
the
secretary
of
the
bishop
came
here
to
tell
me
that
his
lordship
is
greatly
displeased
because
i
have
you
in
my
and
that
too
murmured
the
canon
and
that
too
i
said
that
in
spite
of
the
respect
which
i
owe
the
bishop
and
the
affection
and
reverence
which
i
bear
him
my
nephew
is
my
nephew
and
i
can
not
turn
him
out
of
my
this
is
another
singularity
which
i
find
in
this
place
said
pepe
rey
pale
with
anger
here
apparently
the
bishop
governs
other
people
s
he
is
a
saint
he
is
so
fond
of
me
that
he
imagines
he
imagines
that
you
are
going
to
contaminate
us
with
your
atheism
your
disregard
for
public
opinion
your
strange
ideas
i
have
told
him
repeatedly
that
at
bottom
you
are
an
excellent
young
some
concession
must
always
be
made
to
superior
talent
observed
don
inocencio
and
this
morning
when
i
was
at
the
cirujedas
oh
you
can
not
imagine
in
what
a
state
they
had
my
head
was
it
true
that
you
had
come
to
pull
down
the
cathedral
that
you
were
commissioned
by
the
english
protestants
to
go
preaching
heresy
throughout
spain
that
you
spent
the
whole
night
gambling
in
the
casino
that
you
were
drunk
in
the
streets
but
senoras
i
said
to
them
would
you
have
me
send
my
nephew
to
the
hotel
besides
they
are
wrong
about
the
drunkenness
and
as
for
gambling
i
have
never
yet
heard
that
you
pepe
rey
found
himself
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
the
calmest
man
is
seized
by
a
sudden
rage
by
a
blind
and
brutal
impulse
to
strangle
some
one
to
strike
some
one
in
the
face
to
break
some
one
s
head
to
crush
some
one
s
bones
but
dona
perfecta
was
a
woman
and
was
besides
his
aunt
and
don
inocencio
was
an
old
man
and
an
ecclesiastic
in
addition
to
this
physical
violence
is
in
bad
taste
and
unbecoming
a
person
of
education
and
a
christian
there
remained
the
resource
of
giving
vent
to
his
suppressed
wrath
in
dignified
and
polite
language
but
this
last
resource
seemed
to
him
premature
and
only
to
be
employed
at
the
moment
of
his
final
departure
from
the
house
and
from
orbajosa
controlling
his
fury
then
he
waited
jacinto
entered
as
they
were
finishing
supper
senor
don
jose
he
said
pressing
the
young
man
s
hand
you
and
your
friends
kept
me
from
working
this
afternoon
i
was
not
able
to
write
a
line
and
i
had
so
much
to
do
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
jacinto
but
according
to
what
they
tell
me
you
accompany
them
sometimes
in
their
i
exclaimed
the
boy
turning
scarlet
why
you
know
very
well
that
tafetan
never
speaks
a
word
of
truth
but
is
it
true
senor
de
rey
that
you
are
going
away
is
that
the
report
in
the
town
yes
i
heard
it
in
the
casino
and
at
don
lorenzo
ruiz
rey
contemplated
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
the
fresh
face
of
don
nominative
then
he
said
well
it
is
not
true
my
aunt
is
very
well
satisfied
with
me
she
despises
the
calumnies
with
which
the
orbajosans
are
favoring
me
and
she
will
not
turn
me
out
of
her
house
even
though
the
bishop
himself
should
try
to
make
her
do
as
for
turning
you
out
of
the
house
never
what
would
your
father
say
notwithstanding
all
your
kindness
dearest
aunt
notwithstanding
the
cordial
friendship
of
the
reverend
canon
it
is
possible
that
i
may
myself
decide
to
go
to
go
away
to
go
away
you
a
strange
light
shone
in
dona
perfecta
s
eyes
the
canon
experienced
though
he
was
in
dissimulation
could
not
conceal
his
joy
yes
and
perhaps
this
very
why
man
how
impetuous
you
are
why
don
t
you
at
least
wait
until
morning
here
juan
let
some
one
go
for
uncle
licurgo
to
get
the
nag
ready

suppose
you
will
take
some
luncheon
with
you
nicolasa
that
piece
of
veal
that
is
on
the
sideboard
librada
the
senorito
s
no
i
can
not
believe
that
you
would
take
so
rash
a
resolution
said
don
cayetano
thinking
himself
obliged
to
take
some
part
in
the
question
but
you
will
come
back
will
you
not
asked
the
canon
at
what
time
does
the
morning
train
pass
asked
dona
perfecta
in
whose
eyes
was
clearly
discernible
the
feverish
impatience
of
her
exaltation
i
am
going
away
but
there
is
no
in
the
soul
of
dona
perfecta
in
the
soul
of
the
penitentiary
in
the
little
doctor
s
youthful
soul
echoed
like
a
celestial
harmony
the
word
of
course
dear
pepe
you
will
come
back
i
wrote
to
your
father
your
excellent
father
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
with
all
the
physiognomic
signs
that
make
their
appearance
when
a
tear
is
about
to
be
shed
i
will
trouble
you
with
a
few
commissions
said
the
savant
a
good
opportunity
to
order
the
volume
that
is
wanting
in
my
copy
of
the
abbe
gaume
s
work
said
the
youthful
lawyer
you
take
such
sudden
notions
pepe
you
are
so
full
of
caprices
murmured
dona
perfecta
smiling
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
of
the
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
caballuco
is
waiting
to
speak
to
chapter
xv
discord
continues
to
grow
until
war
is
declared
every
one
looked
toward
the
door
at
which
appeared
the
imposing
figure
of
the
centaur
and
frowning
embarrassed
by
his
anxiety
to
salute
the
company
politely
savagely
handsome
but
disfigured
by
the
violence
which
he
did
himself
in
smiling
civilly
and
treading
softly
and
holding
his
herculean
arms
in
a
correct
posture
come
in
senor
ramos
said
pepe
rey
no
no
objected
dona
perfecta
what
he
has
to
say
to
you
is
an
let
him
say
i
ought
not
to
allow
such
ridiculous
questions
to
be
discussed
in
my
what
is
senor
ramos
business
with
me
caballuco
uttered
a
few
words
enough
enough
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
don
t
trouble
my
nephew
any
more
pepe
don
t
mind
this
simpleton
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
the
cause
of
the
great
caballuco
s
anger
she
said
turning
to
the
others
anger
i
think
i
can
imagine
said
the
penitentiary
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
laughing
with
boisterous
hilarity
i
wanted
to
say
to
senor
don
jose
growled
the
formidable
horseman
hold
your
tongue
man
for
heaven
s
sake
and
don
t
tire
us
any
more
with
that
senor
caballuco
said
the
canon
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
gentlemen
from
the
capital
should
cut
out
the
rough
riders
of
this
savage
in
two
words
pepe
the
question
is
this
caballuco
is
she
could
not
go
on
for
laughing
is
i
don
t
know
just
what
said
don
inocencio
of
one
of
the
troya
girls
of
mariquita
juana
if
i
am
not
and
he
is
jealous
after
his
horse
the
first
thing
in
creation
for
him
is
mariquilla
a
pretty
insinuation
that
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
poor
cristobal
did
you
suppose
that
a
person
like
my
nephew
let
us
hear
what
were
you
going
to
say
to
him
senor
don
jose
and
i
will
talk
together
presently
responded
the
bravo
of
the
town
brusquely
and
without
another
word
he
left
the
room
shortly
afterward
pepe
rey
left
the
to
retire
to
his
own
room
in
the
hall
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
trojan
antagonist
and
he
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
the
sight
of
the
fierce
and
gloomy
countenance
of
the
offended
lover
a
word
with
you
said
the
latter
planting
himself
insolently
in
front
of
the
engineer
do
you
know
who
i
am
as
he
spoke
he
laid
his
heavy
hand
on
the
young
man
s
shoulder
with
such
insolent
familiarity
that
the
latter
incensed
flung
him
off
with
violence
saying
it
is
not
necessary
to
crush
one
to
say
the
bravo
somewhat
disconcerted
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
and
looking
at
rey
with
provoking
boldness
repeated
his
refrain
do
you
know
who
i
am
yes
i
know
now
that
you
are
a
he
pushed
the
bully
roughly
aside
and
went
into
his
room
as
traced
on
the
excited
brain
of
our
unfortunate
friend
at
this
moment
his
plan
of
action
might
be
summed
up
briefly
and
definitely
as
follows
to
break
caballuco
s
head
without
loss
of
time
then
to
take
leave
of
his
aunt
in
severe
but
polite
words
which
should
reach
her
soul
to
bid
a
cold
adieu
to
the
canon
and
give
an
embrace
to
the
inoffensive
don
cayetano
to
administer
a
thrashing
to
uncle
licurgo
by
way
of
winding
up
the
entertainment
and
leave
orbajosa
that
very
night
shaking
the
dust
from
his
shoes
at
the
city
gates
but
in
the
midst
of
all
these
mortifications
and
persecutions
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
not
ceased
to
think
of
another
unhappy
being
whom
he
believed
to
be
in
a
situation
even
more
painful
and
distressing
than
his
own
one
of
the
followed
the
engineer
into
his
room
did
you
give
her
my
message
he
asked
yes
senor
and
she
gave
me
rey
took
from
the
girl
s
hand
a
fragment
of
a
newspaper
on
the
margin
of
which
he
read
these
words
they
say
you
are
going
away
i
shall
die
if
you
when
he
returned
to
the
uncle
licurgo
looked
in
at
the
door
and
asked
at
what
hour
do
you
want
the
horse
at
no
hour
answered
rey
quickly
then
you
are
not
going
said
dona
perfecta
well
it
is
better
to
wait
until
i
am
not
going
when
are
you
going
then
we
will
see
presently
said
the
young
man
coldly
looking
at
his
aunt
with
imperturbable
calmness
for
the
present
i
do
not
intend
to
go
his
eyes
flashed
forth
a
fierce
challenge
dona
perfecta
turned
first
red
then
pale
she
looked
at
the
canon
who
had
taken
off
his
gold
spectacles
to
wipe
them
and
then
fixed
her
eyes
successively
on
each
of
the
other
persons
in
the
room
including
caballuco
who
entering
shortly
before
had
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
dona
perfecta
looked
at
them
as
a
general
looks
at
his
trusty
then
she
studied
the
thoughtful
and
serene
countenance
of
her
nephew
of
that
enemy
who
by
a
strategic
movement
suddenly
reappeared
before
her
when
she
believed
him
to
be
in
shameful
flight
alas
bloodshed
ruin
and
desolation
a
great
battle
was
about
to
be
fought
chapter
xvi
night
orbajosa
slept
the
melancholy
were
shedding
their
last
gleams
at
and
in
like
tired
eyes
struggling
in
vain
against
sleep
by
their
dim
light
wrapped
in
their
cloaks
glided
past
like
shadows
vagabonds
watchmen
and
gamblers
only
the
hoarse
shout
of
the
drunkard
or
the
song
of
the
serenader
broke
the
peaceful
silence
of
the
historic
city
suddenly
the
ave
maria
purisima
of
some
drunken
watchman
would
be
heard
like
a
moan
uttered
in
its
sleep
by
the
town
in
dona
perfecta
s
house
also
silence
reigned
unbroken
but
for
a
conversation
which
was
taking
place
between
don
cayetano
and
pepe
rey
in
the
library
of
the
former
the
savant
was
seated
comfortably
in
the
beside
his
study
table
which
was
covered
with
papers
of
various
kinds
containing
notes
annotations
and
references
all
arranged
in
the
most
perfect
order
rey
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
heap
of
papers
but
his
thoughts
were
doubtless
far
away
from
this
accumulated
learning
perfecta
said
the
antiquary
although
she
is
an
excellent
woman
has
the
defect
of
allowing
herself
to
be
shocked
by
any
little
act
of
folly
in
these
provincial
towns
my
dear
friend
the
slightest
slip
is
dearly
paid
for
i
see
nothing
particular
in
your
having
gone
to
the
troyas
house
i
fancy
that
don
inocencio
under
his
cloak
of
piety
is
something
of
a
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
matter
we
have
reached
a
point
senor
don
cayetano
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
decisive
resolution
i
must
see
rosario
and
speak
with
see
her
then
but
they
will
not
let
me
answered
the
engineer
striking
the
table
with
his
clenched
hand
rosario
is
kept
a
a
prisoner
repeated
the
savant
incredulously
the
truth
is
that
i
do
not
like
her
looks
or
her
hair
and
still
less
the
vacant
expression
in
her
beautiful
eyes
she
is
melancholy
she
talks
little
she
weeps
friend
don
jose
i
greatly
fear
that
the
girl
may
be
attacked
by
the
terrible
malady
to
which
so
many
of
the
members
of
my
family
have
fallen
a
terrible
malady
what
is
it
madness
or
rather
mania
not
a
single
member
of
my
family
has
been
free
from
it
i
alone
have
escaped
you
but
leaving
aside
the
question
of
madness
said
rey
with
impatience
i
wish
to
see
nothing
more
natural
but
the
isolation
in
which
her
mother
keeps
her
is
a
hygienic
measure
dear
pepe
and
the
only
one
that
has
been
successfully
employed
with
the
various
members
of
my
family
consider
that
the
person
whose
presence
and
voice
would
make
the
strongest
impression
on
rosarillo
s
delicate
nervous
system
is
the
chosen
of
her
in
spite
of
all
that
insisted
pepe
i
wish
to
see
perhaps
perfecta
will
not
oppose
your
doing
so
said
the
savant
giving
his
attention
to
his
notes
and
papers
i
don
t
want
to
take
any
responsibility
in
the
the
engineer
seeing
that
he
could
obtain
nothing
from
the
good
polentinos
rose
to
retire
you
are
going
to
work
he
said
and
i
will
not
trouble
you
any
no
there
is
time
enough
see
the
amount
of
precious
information
that
i
collected
listen
in
a
native
of
orbajosa
called
bartolome
del
hoyo
went
to
in
one
of
the
galleys
of
the
marquis
of
castel
another
in
the
same
year
two
brothers
named
juan
and
rodrigo
gonzalez
del
arco
embarked
in
one
of
the
six
ships
which
sailed
from
maestricht
on
the
of
february
and
which
encountered
in
the
latitude
of
calais
an
english
vessel
and
the
flemish
fleet
commanded
by
van
that
was
truly
an
important
exploit
of
our
navy
i
have
discovered
that
it
was
an
orbajosan
one
mateo
diaz
coronel
an
ensign
in
the
guards
who
in
wrote
and
published
in
valencia
the
metrical
encomium
funeral
chant
lyrical
eulogy
numerical
description
glorious
sufferings
and
sorrowful
glories
of
the
queen
of
the
i
possess
a
most
precious
copy
of
this
work
which
is
worth
the
mines
of
peru
another
orbajosan
was
the
author
of
that
famous
treatise
on
the
various
styles
of
horsemanship
which
i
showed
you
yesterday
and
in
short
there
is
not
a
step
i
take
in
the
labyrinth
of
unpublished
history
that
i
do
not
stumble
against
some
illustrious
compatriot
it
is
my
purpose
to
draw
all
these
names
out
of
the
unjust
obscurity
and
oblivion
in
which
they
have
so
long
lain
how
pure
a
joy
dear
pepe
to
restore
all
their
lustre
to
the
glories
epic
and
literary
of
one
s
native
place
and
how
could
a
man
better
employ
the
scant
intellect
with
which
heaven
has
endowed
him
the
fortune
which
he
has
inherited
and
the
brief
period
of
time
on
earth
allowed
to
even
the
longest
life
thanks
to
me
it
will
be
seen
that
orbajosa
is
the
illustrious
cradle
of
spanish
genius
but
what
do
i
say
is
not
its
illustrious
ancestry
evident
in
the
nobleness
and
of
the
present
urbs
augustan
generation
we
know
few
places
where
all
the
virtues
unchoked
by
the
malefic
weeds
of
vice
grow
more
luxuriantly
here
all
is
peace
mutual
respect
christian
humility
charity
is
practised
here
as
it
was
in
biblical
times
here
envy
is
unknown
here
the
criminal
passions
are
unknown
and
if
you
hear
thieves
and
murderers
spoken
of
you
may
be
sure
that
they
are
not
the
children
of
this
noble
soil
or
that
if
they
are
they
belong
to
the
number
of
unhappy
creatures
perverted
by
the
teachings
of
demagogues
here
you
will
see
the
national
character
in
all
its
purity
upright
noble
incorruptible
pure
simple
patriarchal
hospitable
generous
therefore
it
is
that
i
live
so
happy
in
this
solitude
far
from
the
turmoil
of
cities
where
alas
falsehood
and
vice
reign
therefore
it
is
that
the
many
friends
whom
i
have
in
madrid
have
not
been
able
to
tempt
me
from
this
place
therefore
it
is
that
i
spend
my
life
in
the
sweet
companionship
of
my
faithful
townspeople
and
my
books
breathing
the
wholesome
atmosphere
of
integrity
which
is
gradually
becoming
circumscribed
in
our
spain
to
the
humble
and
christian
towns
that
have
preserved
it
with
the
emanations
of
their
virtues
and
believe
me
my
dear
pepe
this
peaceful
isolation
has
greatly
contributed
to
preserve
me
from
the
terrible
malady
connatural
in
my
family
in
my
youth
i
suffered
like
my
brothers
and
my
father
from
a
lamentable
propensity
to
the
most
absurd
manias
but
here
you
have
me
so
miraculously
cured
that
all
i
know
of
the
malady
is
what
i
see
of
it
in
others
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
i
am
so
uneasy
about
my
little
i
am
rejoiced
that
the
air
of
orbajosa
has
proved
so
beneficial
to
you
said
rey
unable
to
resist
the
jesting
mood
that
by
a
strange
contradiction
came
over
him
in
the
midst
of
his
sadness
with
me
it
has
agreed
so
badly
that
i
think
i
shall
soon
become
mad
if
i
remain
in
it
well
and
success
to
your
pepe
went
to
his
room
but
feeling
neither
a
desire
for
sleep
or
the
need
of
physical
repose
on
the
contrary
a
violent
excitation
of
mind
which
impelled
him
to
move
to
act
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
torturing
himself
with
useless
cavilling
after
a
time
he
opened
the
window
which
overlooked
the
garden
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
parapet
he
gazed
out
on
the
limitless
darkness
of
the
night
nothing
could
be
seen
but
he
who
is
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
sees
with
the
mental
vision
and
pepe
rey
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
darkness
saw
the
varied
panorama
of
his
misfortunes
unroll
itself
upon
it
before
him
the
obscurity
did
not
permit
him
to
see
the
flowers
of
the
earth
nor
those
of
the
heavens
which
are
the
stars
the
very
absence
of
light
produced
the
effect
of
an
illusory
movement
in
the
masses
of
foliage
which
seemed
to
stretch
away
to
recede
slowly
and
come
curling
back
like
the
waves
of
a
shadowy
sea
a
vast
flux
and
reflux
a
strife
between
forces
vaguely
comprehended
agitated
the
silent
sky
the
mathematician
contemplating
this
strange
projection
of
his
soul
upon
the
night
said
to
himself
the
battle
will
be
terrible
let
us
see
who
will
come
out
of
it
the
nocturnal
insects
whispered
in
his
ear
mysterious
words
here
a
shrill
chirp
there
a
click
like
the
click
made
with
the
tongue
further
on
plaintive
murmurs
in
the
distance
a
tinkle
like
that
of
the
bell
on
the
neck
of
the
wandering
ox
suddenly
rey
heard
a
strange
sound
a
rapid
note
that
could
be
produced
only
by
the
human
tongue
and
lips
this
sibilant
breathing
passed
through
the
young
man
s
brain
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
felt
that
swift
dart
through
him
repeated
again
and
then
again
with
augmented
intensity
he
looked
all
around
then
he
looked
toward
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
he
fancied
that
in
one
of
the
windows
he
could
distinguish
an
object
like
a
white
bird
flapping
its
wings
through
pepe
rey
s
excited
mind
flashed
instantly
the
idea
of
the
phoenix
of
the
dove
of
the
regal
heron
and
yet
the
bird
he
saw
was
noting
more
than
a
handkerchief
the
engineer
sprang
from
the
balcony
into
the
garden
observing
attentively
he
saw
the
hand
and
the
face
of
his
cousin
he
thought
he
could
perceive
the
gesture
commonly
employed
of
imposing
silence
by
laying
the
finger
on
the
lips
then
the
dear
shade
pointed
downward
and
disappeared
pepe
rey
returned
quickly
to
this
room
entered
the
hall
noiselessly
and
walked
slowly
forward
he
felt
his
heart
beat
with
violence
he
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
at
last
he
heard
distinctly
light
taps
on
the
steps
of
the
stairs
one
two
three
the
sounds
were
produced
by
a
pair
of
little
shoes
he
walked
in
the
direction
whence
they
proceeded
and
stretched
out
his
hands
in
the
obscurity
to
assist
the
person
who
was
descending
the
stairs
in
his
soul
there
reigned
an
exalted
and
profound
tenderness
but
why
seek
to
deny
it
mingling
with
this
tender
feeling
there
suddenly
arose
within
him
like
an
infernal
inspiration
another
sentiment
a
fierce
desire
for
revenge
the
steps
continued
to
descend
coming
nearer
and
nearer
pepe
rey
went
forward
and
a
pair
of
hands
groping
in
the
darkness
came
in
contact
with
his
own
the
two
pairs
of
hands
were
united
in
a
close
clasp

in
the

the
hall
was
long
and
broad
at

end
of
it
was
the
door
of

room
occupied
by
the

of

into

sank
down
on

from
the
movements
of

right

comprehended
that
she
was
blessing

allowing
me
to
see

he
exclaimed
embracing
her
ardently
he
felt
the
girl

cold
fingers
on
his
lips
imposing
silence
he
kissed
them
rapturously
you

why
do
you
tremble

her
teeth
were
chattering
and
her
whole
frame
trembled
convulsively

felt
the
burning
heat
of
his
cousin

face
against
his
own
and
he
cried
in
alarm
your
forehead
is
burning
you
are
are
you
really
ill
and
you
have
left
your
room
to
see
the

wrapped
his
arms
around

to
protect
her
from
the
cold
but
it
was
not
enough

said
quickly
rising

left
the

burning
in
his
room
through
the
door
of
which
issued
a
faint
streak
of
light
illuminating
the

he
returned
in
an
instant
the
darkness
was
now
profound
groping
his
way
along
the
wall
he
reached
the
spot
where
his
cousin
was
sitting
and
wrapped
the
rug
carefully
around
her
you

comfortable
now
my
yes
so
comfortable
with
you
with

and
forever
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
exaltation
but
he
observed
that
she
was
releasing
herself
from
his
arms
and
was
rising
what
are
you
doing
a
metallic
sound
was
heard

put
the
key
into
the
invisible
lock
and
was
cautiously
opening
the
door
on
the
threshold
of
which
they
had
been
sitting
the
faint
odor
of
dampness
peculiar
to
rooms
that
have
been
long
shut
up
issued
from
the
place
which
was
as
dark
as
a

felt
himself
being
guided
by
the
hand
and
his

voice
said
faintly

they
took
a
few
steps
forward
he
imagined
himself
being
led
to
an
unknown
elysium
by

angel
of

groped
her
way
at
last
her
sweet
voice
sounded
again
murmuring
sit
they
were
beside
a
wooden
bench
both
sat
down
pepe
rey
embraced
rosario
again
as
he
did
so
his
head
struck
against
a
hard
body
what
is
this
he
asked
the
rosario
what
are
you
saying
the
feet
of
the
divine
jesus
of
the
image
of
christ
crucified
that
we
adore
in
my
pepe

strike
through
him

them
said
the
young
girl
imperiously
the
mathematician
kissed
the
cold
feet
of
the
holy
image
pepe
then
cried
the
young
girl
pressing
her
cousin
s
hand
ardently
between
her
own
do
you
believe
in
god
rosario
what
are
you
saying
what
absurdities
are
you
imagining
responded
her
cousin
perplexed
answer
pepe
rey
felt
drops
of
moisture
on
his
hands
why
are
you
crying
he
said
greatly
disturbed
rosario
you
are
killing
me
with
your
absurd
doubts
do
i
believe
in
god
do
you
doubt
it
i
do
not
doubt
it
but
they
all
say
that
you
are
an
you
would
suffer
in
my
estimation
you
would
lose
your
aureole
of
purity
your
charm
if
you
gave
credit
to
such
when
i
heard
them
accuse
you
of
being
an
atheist
although
i
could
bring
no
proof
to
the
contrary
i
protested
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
against
such
a
calumny
you
can
not
be
an
atheist
i
have
within
me
as
strong
and
deep
a
conviction
of
your
faith
as
of
my
how
wisely
you
speak
why
then
do
you
ask
me
if
i
believe
in
god
because
i
wanted
to
hear
it
from
your
own
lips
and
rejoice
in
hearing
you
say
it
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
heard
the
sound
of
your
voice
what
greater
happiness
than
to
hear
it
again
saying
i
believe
in
god
rosario
even
the
wicked
believe
in
him
if
there
be
atheists
which
i
doubt
they
are
the
calumniators
the
intriguers
with
whom
the
world
is
infested
for
my
part
intrigues
and
calumnies
matter
little
to
me
and
if
you
rise
superior
to
them
and
close
your
heart
against
the
discord
which
a
perfidious
hand
would
sow
in
it
nothing
shall
interfere
with
our
but
what
is
going
on
around
us
pepe
dear
pepe
do
you
believe
in
the
devil
the
engineer
was
silent
the
darkness
of
the
chapel
prevented
rosario
from
seeing
the
smile
with
which
her
cousin
received
this
strange
question
we
must
believe
in
him
he
said
at
last
what
is
going
on
mamma
forbids
me
to
see
you
but
except
in
regard
to
the
atheism
she
does
not
say
any
thing
against
you
she
tells
me
to
wait
that
you
will
decide
that
you
are
going
away
that
you
are
coming
back
speak
to
me
with
frankness
have
you
formed
a
bad
opinion
of
my
mother
not
at
all
replied
rey
urged
by
a
feeling
of
delicacy
do
you
not
believe
as
i
do
that
she
loves
us
both
that
she
desires
only
our
good
and
that
we
shall
in
the
end
obtain
her
consent
to
our
wishes
if
you
believe
it
i
do
too
your
mama
adores
us
both
but
dear
rosario
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
devil
has
entered
this
don
t
jest
she
said
affectionately
ah
mamma
is
very
good
she
has
not
once
said
to
me
that
you
were
unworthy
to
be
my
husband
all
she
insists
upon
is
the
atheism
they
say
besides
that
i
have
manias
and
that
i
have
the
mania
now
of
loving
you
with
all
my
soul
in
our
family
it
is
a
rule
not
to
oppose
directly
the
manias
that
are
hereditary
in
it
because
to
oppose
them
aggravates
well
i
believe
that
there
are
skilful
physicians
at
your
side
who
have
determined
to
cure
you
and
who
will
in
the
end
my
adored
girl
succeed
in
doing
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
exclaimed
rosario
leaning
her
forehead
on
her
lover
s
breast
i
am
willing
to
be
mad
if
i
am
with
you
for
you
i
am
suffering
for
you
i
am
ill
for
you
i
despise
life
and
i
risk
death
i
know
it
now
i
shall
be
worse
i
shall
be
dangerously
ill
i
shall
die
what
does
it
matter
to
me
you
are
not
ill
he
responded
with
energy
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
but
an
agitation
of
mind
which
naturally
brings
with
it
some
slight
nervous
disturbances
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
but
the
suffering
occasioned
by
the
horrible
coercion
which
they
are
using
with
you
your
simple
and
generous
soul
does
not
comprehend
it
you
yield
you
forgive
those
who
injure
you
you
torment
yourself
attributing
your
suffering
to
baleful
supernatural
influences
you
suffer
in
silence
you
give
your
innocent
neck
to
the
executioner
you
allow
yourself
to
be
slain
and
the
very
knife
which
is
plunged
into
your
breast
seems
to
you
the
thorn
of
a
flower
that
has
pierced
you
in
passing
rosario
cast
those
ideas
from
your
mind
consider
our
real
situation
which
is
serious
seek
its
cause
where
it
really
is
and
do
not
give
way
to
your
fears
do
not
yield
to
the
tortures
which
are
inflicted
upon
you
making
yourself
mentally
and
physically
ill
the
courage
which
you
lack
would
restore
you
to
health
because
you
are
not
really
ill
my
dear
girl
you
are
do
you
wish
me
to
say
it
you
are
frightened
terrified
you
are
under
what
the
ancients
not
knowing
how
to
express
it
called
an
evil
spell
courage
rosario
trust
in
me
rise
and
follow
me
that
is
all
i
will
ah
pepe
cousin
i
believe
that
you
are
right
exclaimed
rosario
drowned
in
tears
your
words
resound
within
my
heart
arousing
in
it
new
energy
new
life
here
in
this
darkness
where
we
can
not
see
each
other
s
faces
an
ineffable
light
emanates
from
you
and
inundates
my
soul
what
power
have
you
to
transform
me
in
this
way
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
became
another
being
in
the
days
when
i
did
not
see
you
i
returned
to
my
former
insignificance
my
natural
cowardice
without
you
my
pepe
i
live
in
limbo
i
will
do
as
you
tell
me
i
will
arise
and
follow
you
we
will
go
together
wherever
you
wish
do
you
know
that
i
feel
well
do
you
know
that
i
have
no
fever
that
i
have
recovered
my
strength
that
i
want
to
run
about
and
cry
out
that
my
whole
being
is
renewed
and
enlarged
and
multiplied
a
in
order
to
adore
you
pepe
you
are
right
i
am
not
sick
i
am
only
afraid
or
rather
that
is
it
bewitched
terrible
eyes
look
at
me
and
i
remain
mute
and
trembling
i
am
afraid
but
of
what
you
alone
have
the
strange
power
of
calling
me
back
to
life
hearing
you
i
live
again
i
believe
if
i
were
to
die
and
you
were
to
pass
by
my
grave
that
deep
under
the
ground
i
should
feel
your
footsteps
oh
if
i
could
see
you
now
but
you
are
here
beside
me
and
i
can
not
doubt
that
it
is
you
so
many
days
without
seeing
you
i
was
mad
each
day
of
solitude
appeared
to
me
a
century
they
said
to
me
and
and
always
i
looked
out
of
the
window
at
night
and
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
your
room
served
to
console
me
at
times
your
shadow
on
the
window
was
for
me
a
divine
apparition
i
stretched
out
my
arms
to
you
i
shed
tears
and
cried
out
inwardly
without
daring
to
do
so
with
my
voice
when
i
received
the
message
you
sent
me
with
the
maid
when
i
received
your
letter
telling
me
that
you
were
going
away
i
grew
very
sad
i
thought
my
soul
was
leaving
my
body
and
that
i
was
dying
slowly
i
fell
like
the
bird
wounded
as
it
flies
that
falls
and
falling
dies
when
i
saw
that
you
were
awake
so
late
i
could
not
resist
the
longing
i
had
to
speak
to
you
and
i
came
down
stairs
i
believe
that
all
the
courage
of
my
life
has
been
used
up
in
this
single
act
and
that
now
i
can
never
be
any
thing
again
but
a
coward
but
you
will
give
me
courage
you
will
give
me
strength
you
will
help
me
will
you
not
pepe
my
dear
cousin
tell
me
that
you
will
tell
me
that
i
am
strong
and
i
will
be
strong
tell
me
that
i
am
not
ill
and
i
will
not
be
ill
i
am
not
ill
now
i
feel
so
well
that
i
could
laugh
at
my
ridiculous
as
she
said
this
she
felt
herself
clasped
rapturously
in
her
cousin
s
arms
an
oh
was
heard
but
it
came
not
from
her
lips
but
from
his
for
in
bending
his
head
he
had
struck
it
violently
against
the
feet
of
the
crucifix
in
the
darkness
it
is
that
the
stars
are
seen
in
the
exalted
state
of
his
mind
by
a
species
of
hallucination
natural
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
to
pepe
rey
not
that
his
head
had
struck
against
the
sacred
foot
but
that
this
had
moved
warning
him
in
the
briefest
and
most
eloquent
manner
raising
his
head
he
said
half
seriously
half
gayly
lord
do
not
strike
me
i
will
do
nothing
at
the
same
moment
rosario
took
the
young
man
s
hand
and
pressed
it
against
her
heart
a
voice
was
heard
a
pure
grave
angelic
voice
full
of
feeling
saying
lord
whom
i
adore
lord
god
of
the
world
and
guardian
of
my
house
and
of
my
family
lord
whom
pepe

adores
holy
and
blessed
christ
who
died
on
the
cross
for
our
sins
before
thee
before
thy
wounded
body
before
thy
forehead
crowned
with
thorns
i
say
that
this
man
is
my
husband
and
that
after
thee
he
is
the
being
whom
my
heart
loves
most
i
say
that
i
declare
him
to
be
my
husband
and
that
i
will
die
before

belong
to

my
heart
and
my

not
the

oppose
our
happiness
and
grant
me
the

exaltation

sank
powerless
into
her
cousin
s
arms
she
trembled
in
his
manly
embrace
as
the
dove
trembles
in
the
talons
of
the
eagle
through
the
engineer
s
mind
the
thought
flashed
that
the
devil
existed
but
the
devil
then
was

rosario
made
a
slight
movement
of
fear
she
felt
the
thrill
of
surprise
so
to
say
that
gives
warning
that
danger
is
near
swear
to
me
that
you
will
not
yield
to

with
confusion
observing
the
movement
i
swear
it
to
you
by
my
father

ashes
that
are
where
under

the
mathematician
felt
the
stone
rise
under

repeated
the
pepe

with
profound
emotion
feeling
his
soul
filled
with
an
inexplicable
trouble
both
remained
silent
for
a
short
time
rosario
had
risen
already
he
said
she
sat
down
again
you
are
trembling
again
said
pepe

you
are
ill
your

murmured
the
young
girl
faintly
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
she
fell
senseless
into
her
cousin
s
arms
caressing
her
he
noticed
that
her
face
was
covered
with
a
cold
perspiration
she
is
really
ill
he
said
to
himself
it
was
a
piece
of
great
imprudence
to
have
come
down
he
lifted
her
up
in
his
arms
endeavoring
to
restore
her
to
consciousness
but
neither
the
trembling
that
had
seized
her
nor
her
insensibility
passed
away
and
he
resolved
to
carry
her
out
of
the
chapel
in
the
hope
that
the
fresh
air
would
revive
her
and
so
it
was
when
she
recovered
consciousness
rosario
manifested
great
disquietude
at
finding
herself
at
such
an
hour
out
of
her
own
room
the
clock
of
the

silent
the
anxiety

the
silence
intense
don
t
you
hear
any
thing
pepe
absolutely
pay
attention
there
there
it
is
again
it
is
a
noise
that
sounds
as
if
it
might
be
either
very
very
distant
or
very
near
it
might
either
be
my
mother
s
breathing
or
the
creaking
of
the
vane
on
the
tower
of
the
cathedral

first

it
is
a
metallic
your
mother
s
breathing
no
it
is
not
that
the
noise
comes
from
a
great
distance
perhaps
it
is
the
crowing
of
a
cock
perhaps
it
sounds
like
the
words
i

am
going

it

it
is
not
a
trumpet
but
a
clarionet
the
soldiers

soldiers

instant
he
had
carried

and
the
lovers
took
a
whispered
leave
of
each
other

will
stand
at
the
window
overlooking

garden
so
that

pepe
rey
did
as
he
was
bade
but
he
waited
a
long
time
and
rosario
did
not
appear
at
the
window
the
engineer
fancied
he
heard
agitated
voices
on
the
floor
above
him
chapter
xviii
the
soldiers
the
inhabitants
of
orbajosa
heard
in
the
twilight
vagueness
of
their
morning
slumbers
the
same
sonorous
clarionet
and
they
opened
their
eyes
saying
the
soldiers
some
murmured
to
themselves
between
sleeping
and
waking
at
last
they
have
sent
us
that
others
got
out
of
bed
hastily
growling
let
us
go
take
a
look
at
those
confounded
some
soliloquized
in
this
way
it
will
be
necessary
to
hurry
up
matters
they
say
drafts
and
contributions
we
will
say
blows
and
more
in
another
house
were
heard
these
words
uttered
joyfully
perhaps
my
son
is
coming
perhaps
my
brother
is
coming
everywhere
people
were
springing
out
of
bed
dressing
hastily
opening
the
windows
to
see
the
regiment
that
caused
all
this
excitement
entering
the
city
in
the
early
dawn
the
city
was
gloom
silence
age
the
army
gayety
boisterousness
youth
as
the
army
entered
the
city
it
seemed
as
if
the
mummy
received
by
some
magic
art
the
gift
of
life
and
sprang
with
noisy
gayety
from
its
damp
sarcophagus
to
dance
around
it
what
movement
what
shouting
what
laughter
what
merriment
there
is
nothing
so
interesting
as
a
regiment
it
is
our
country
in
its
youthful
and
vigorous
aspect
all
the
ineptitude
the
turbulence
the
superstition
at
times
and
at
times
the
impiety
of
the
country
as
represented
in
the
individual
disappears
under
the
iron
rule
of
discipline
which
of
so
many
insignificant
figures
makes
an
imposing
whole
the
soldier
or
so
to
say
the
corpuscle
separating
at
the
command
break
ranks
from
the
mass
in
which
he
has
led
a
regular
and
at
times
a
sublime
life
occasionally
preserves
some
of
the
qualities
peculiar
to
the
army
but
this
is
not
the
general
rule
the
separation
is
most
often
accompanied
by
a
sudden
deterioration
with
the
result
that
if
an
army
is
the
glory
and
honor
of
a
nation
an
assemblage
of
soldiers
may
be
an
insupportable
calamity
and
the
towns
that
shed
tears
of
joy
and
enthusiasm
when
they
see
a
victorious
battalion
enter
their
precincts
groan
with
terror
and
tremble
with
apprehension
when
they
see
the
same
soldiers
separate
and
off
duty
this
last
was
what
happened
in
orbajosa
for
in
those
days
there
were
no
glorious
deeds
to
celebrate
nor
was
there
any
motive
for
weaving
wreaths
or
tracing
triumphal
inscriptions
or
even
for
making
mention
of
the
exploits
of
our
brave
soldiers
for
which
reason
all
was
fear
and
suspicion
in
the
episcopal
city
which
although
poor
did
not
lack
treasures
in
chickens
fruits
money
and
maidenhood
all
of
which
ran
great
risk
from
the
moment
when
the
sons
of
mars
entered
it
in
addition
to
this
the
native
town
of
polentinos
as
a
city
remote
from
the
movement
and
stir
brought
with
them
by
traffic
the
newspapers
railroads
and
other
agents
which
it
is
unnecessary
now
to
specify
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
in
its
tranquil
existence
besides
which
it
manifested
on
every
favorable
occasion
a
strong
aversion
to
submitting
to
the
central
authority
which
badly
or
well
governs
us
and
calling
to
mind
its
former
privileges
and
ruminating
upon
them
anew
as
the
camel
chews
the
cud
of
the
grass
which
it
ate
yesterday
it
would
occasionally
display
a
certain
rebellious
independence
and
vicious
tendencies
much
to
be
deplored
which
at
times
gave
no
little
anxiety
to
the
governor
of
the
province
it
must
also
be
taken
into
account
that
orbajosa
had
rebellious
antecedents
or
rather
ancestry
doubtless
it
still
retained
some
of
those
energetic
fibres
which
in
remote
ages
according
to
the
enthusiastic
opinion
of
don
cayetano
impelled
it
to
unexampled
epic
deeds
and
even
in
its
decadence
occasionally
felt
an
eager
desire
to
do
great
things
although
they
might
be
only
barbarities
and
follies
as
it
had
given
to
the
world
so
many
illustrious
sons
it
desired
no
doubt
that
its
actual
scions
the
caballucos
merengues
and
pelosmalos
should
renew
the
glorious
of
their
predecessors
whenever
there
was
disaffection
in
spain
orbajosa
gave
proof
that
it
was
not
in
vain
that
it
existed
on
the
face
of
the
earth
although
it
is
true
that
it
was
never
the
theatre
of
a
real
war
the
spirit
of
the
town
its
situation
its
history
all
reduced
it
to
the
secondary
part
of
raising
guerillas
it
bestowed
upon
the
country
this
national
product
in
at
the
time
of
the
apostolics
during
the
seven
years
war
in
and
at
other
epochs
of
less
resonance
in
the
national
history
the
guerillas
and
their
chiefs
were
always
popular
a
fatal
circumstance
due
to
the
war
of
independence
one
of
those
good
things
which
have
been
the
origin
of
an
infinite
number
of
detestable
things
optimi
and
with
the
popularity
of
the
guerillas
and
their
chiefs
coincided
in
proportion
the
unpopularity
of
every
one
who
entered
orbajosa
in
the
character
of
a
delegate
or
instrument
of
the
central
power
the
soldiers
were
held
in
such
disrepute
there
that
whenever
the
old
people
told
of
any
crime
any
robbery
assassination
or
the
like
atrocity
they
added
this
happened
when
the
soldiers
were
and
now
that
these
important
observations
have
been
made
it
will
be
well
to
add
that
the
battalions
sent
there
during
the
days
in
which
the
events
of
our
story
took
place
did
not
go
to
parade
through
the
streets
but
for
another
purpose
which
will
be
clearly
and
minutely
set
forth
later
on
as
a
detail
of
no
little
interest
it
may
be
noted
that
the
events
here
related
took
place
at
a
period
neither
very
remote
nor
very
recent
it
may
also
be
said
that
orbajosa
called
by
the
romans
urbs
augusta
although
some
learned
moderns
enquiring
into
the
etymology
of
the
termination
are
of
the
opinion
that
it
comes
by
it
from
being
the
richest
country
in
the
world
is
neither
very
near
madrid
nor
very
far
from
it
nor
can
we
say
whether
its
glorious
foundations
are
laid
toward
the
north
or
toward
the
south
toward
the
east
or
toward
the
west
but
that
it
may
be
supposed
to
be
in
any
part
of
spain
where
the
pungent
odor
of
its
garlic
is
to
be
perceived
rich
in
garlic
the
billets
of
residence
being
distributed
by
the
authorities
each
soldier
went
to
seek
his
borrowed
home
they
were
received
by
their
hosts
with
a
very
ill
grace
and
assigned
the
most
atrociously
uninhabitable
parts
of
the
houses
the
girls
of
the
city
were
not
indeed
among
those
who
were
most
dissatisfied
but
a
strict
watch
was
kept
over
them
and
it
was
considered
not
decent
to
show
pleasure
at
the
visit
of
such
rabble
the
few
soldiers
who
were
natives
of
the
district
only
were
treated
like
kings
the
others
were
regarded
as
invaders
at
eight
in
the
morning
a
of
cavalry
entered
the
house
of
dona
perfecta
polentinos
with
his
billet
he
was
received
by
the
servants
by
order
of
its
mistress
who
being
at
the
time
in
a
deplorable
state
of
mind
did
not
wish
to
go
down
stairs
to
meet
the
soldier
and
by
them
he
was
shown
to
the
only
room
in
the
house
which
it
seemed
was
disposable
the
room
occupied
by
pepe
rey
let
them
settle
themselves
as
best
they
can
said
dona
perfecta
with
an
expression
of
gall
and
vinegar
and
if
they
have
not
room
enough
let
them
go
into
the
was
it
her
intention
to
annoy
in
this
way
her
detested
nephew
or
was
there
really
no
other
unoccupied
room
in
the
house
this
we
do
not
know
nor
do
the
chronicles
from
which
this
true
history
is
taken
say
a
word
on
this
important
point
what
we
know
positively
is
that
far
from
displeasing
the
two
guests
to
be
thus
boxed
up
together
it
gave
them
great
pleasure
as
they
happened
to
be
old
friends
they
were
greatly
surprised
and
delighted
when
they
met
and
they
were
never
tired
of
asking
each
other
questions
and
uttering
exclamations
dwelling
on
the
strange
chance
that
had
brought
them
together
in
such
a
place
and
on
such
an
occasion
pinzon
you
here
why
what
is
this
i
had
no
suspicion
that
you
were
in
this
i
heard
that
you
were
in
this
part
of
the
country
pepe
but
i
had
no
idea
either
that
i
should
meet
you
in
this
horrible
this
barbarous
but
what
a
fortunate
chance
for
this
chance
is
most
fortunate
providential
pinzon
between
us
both
we
are
going
to
do
a
great
thing
in
this
wretched
and
we
shall
have
time
enough
to
consult
about
it
answered
the
other
seating
himself
on
the
bed
in
which
the
engineer
was
lying
for
it
appears
that
we
are
both
to
occupy
this
room
what
the
devil
sort
of
a
house
is
this
why
man
it
is
my
aunt
s
speak
with
more
respect
about
it
have
you
not
met
my
aunt
but
i
am
going
to
get
i
am
very
glad
of
it
for
then
i
can
lie
down
and
rest
and
badly
i
need
it
what
a
road
friend
pepe
what
a
road
and
what
a
town
tell
me
have
you
come
to
set
fire
to
orbajosa
fire
i
ask
you
because
in
that
case
i
might
help
what
a
town
but
what
a
town
exclaimed
the
soldier
removing
his
shako
and
laying
aside
sword
and
travelling
case
and
cloak
this
is
the
second
time
they
have
sent
us
here
i
swear
to
you
that
the
third
time
i
will
ask
my
don
t
talk
ill
of
these
good
people
but
you
have
come
in
the
nick
of
time
it
seems
as
if
providence
has
sent
you
to
my
aid
pinzon
i
have
a
terrible
project
on
hand
an
adventure
a
plot
if
you
wish
to
call
it
so
my
friend
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
me
to
carry
it
through
without
you
a
moment
ago
i
was
in
despair
wondering
how
i
should
manage
and
saying
to
myself
anxiously
if
i
only
had
a
friend
here
a
good
friend
a
project
a
plot
an
adventure
one
of
two
things
senor
mathematician
it
is
either
the
discovery
of
aerial
navigation
or
else
some
love
it
is
serious
very
serious
go
to
bed
sleep
a
while
and
afterward
we
will
talk
about
i
will
go
to
bed
but
i
will
not
sleep
you
may
say
all
you
wish
to
me
all
that
i
ask
is
that
you
will
say
as
little
as
possible
about
it
is
precisely
about
orbajosa
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
but
have
you
also
an
antipathy
to
this
cradle
of
illustrious
men
these
we
call
them
the
may
be
as
illustrious
as
you
choose
but
to
me
they
are
as
irritating
as
the
product
of
the
country
this
is
a
town
ruled
by
people
who
teach
distrust
superstition
and
hatred
of
the
whole
human
race
when
we
have
leisure
i
will
relate
to
you
an
occurrence
an
adventure
that
happened
to
me
here
last
year
when
i
tell
it
to
you
you
will
laugh
and
i
shall
be
fuming
but
in
fine
what
is
past
is
in
what
is
happening
to
me
there
is
nothing
but
i
have
various
reasons
for
hating
this
wretched
place
you
must
know
that
my
father
was
assassinated
here
in
by
a
party
of
barbarous
guerillas
he
was
a
brigadier
and
he
had
left
the
service
the
government
sent
for
him
and
he
was
passing
through
villahorrenda
on
his
way
to
madrid
when
he
was
captured
by
half
a
dozen
ruffians
here
there
are
several
dynasties
of
guerilla
chiefs
the
aceros
the
caballucos
the
pelosmalos
a
periodical
eruption
as
some
one
has
said
who
knew
very
well
what
he
was
talking
i
suppose
that
two
infantry
regiments
and
some
cavalry
have
not
come
here
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
visiting
these
delightful
certainly
not
we
have
come
to
survey
the
country
there
are
many
deposits
of
arms
here
the
government
does
not
venture
as
it
desires
to
remove
from
office
the
greater
number
of
the
municipal
councils
without
first
distributing
a
few
companies
of
soldiers
through
these
towns
as
there
is
so
much
disturbance
in
this
part
of
the
country
as
two
of
the
neighboring
provinces
are
already
infested
and
as
this
municipal
district
of
orbajosa
has
besides
so
brilliant
a
record
in
all
the
civil
wars
there
are
fears
that
the
bravos
of
the
place
may
take
to
the
roads
and
rob
all
they
can
lay
hands
a
good
precaution
but
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
not
until
these
people
die
and
are
born
over
again
not
until
the
very
stones
have
changed
their
form
will
there
be
peace
in
that
is
my
opinion
too
said
the
officer
lighting
a
cigarette
don
t
you
see
that
the
guerilla
chiefs
are
the
pets
of
this
place
those
who
desolated
the
district
in
and
at
other
epochs
or
if
not
they
their
sons
are
employed
in
the
market
inspector
s
office
at
the
town
gates
in
the
in
the
among
them
are
constables
sacristans
bailiffs
some
have
become
powerful
party
leaders
and
they
are
the
ones
who
manage
the
elections
have
influence
in
madrid
bestow
places
in
short
this
is
and
tell
me
is
there
no
hope
of
the
guerilla
chiefs
performing
some
exploit
in
these
days
if
that
should
happen
you
could
destroy
the
town
and
i
would
help
if
it
depended
upon
me
they
will
play
their
usual
pranks
no
doubt
said
pinzon
for
the
insurrection
in
the
two
neighboring
provinces
is
spreading
like
wildfire
and
between
ourselves
friend
rey
i
think
this
is
going
to
last
for
a
long
time
some
people
smile
and
say
that
it
would
be
impossible
that
there
should
be
another
insurrection
like
the
last
one
they
don
t
know
the
country
they
don
t
know
orbajosa
and
its
inhabitants
i
believe
that
the
war
that
is
now
beginning
will
have
serious
consequences
and
that
we
shall
have
another
cruel
and
bloody
struggle
that
will
last
heaven
knows
how
long
what
is
your
opinion
well
in
madrid
i
laughed
at
any
one
who
spoke
of
the
possibility
of
a
civil
war
as
long
and
as
terrible
as
the
seven
years
war
but
since
i
have
been
here
one
must
come
to
the
heart
of
this
enchanting
country
see
the
people
at
home
and
hear
them
talk
to
know
what
the
real
state
of
affairs
just
so
without
knowing
precisely
on
what
i
base
my
opinion
the
fact
is
that
here
i
see
things
in
a
different
light
and
i
now
believe
that
it
is
possible
that
there
may
be
a
long
and
bloody
exactly
but
at
present
my
thoughts
are
occupied
less
by
the
public
war
than
by
a
private
war
in
which
i
am
engaged
and
which
i
declared
a
short
time
you
said
this
was
your
aunt
s
house
what
is
her
name
dona
perfecta
rey
de
ah
i
know
her
by
reputation
she
is
an
excellent
person
and
the
only
one
of
whom
i
have
not
heard
the
speak
ill
when
i
was
here
before
i
heard
her
goodness
her
charity
her
innumerable
virtues
everywhere
yes
my
aunt
is
very
kind
very
amiable
said
rey
then
he
fell
into
a
thoughtful
silence
but
now
i
remember
exclaimed
pinzon
suddenly
how
one
thing
fits
in
with
another
yes
i
heard
in
madrid
that
you
were
going
to
be
married
to
a
cousin
of
yours
all
is
clear
now
is
it
that
beautiful
and
heavenly
rosario
pinzon
we
must
have
a
long
talk
i
imagine
that
there
are
there
is
something
more
there
is
violent
opposition
i
have
need
of
a
determined
friend
a
friend
who
is
prompt
to
act
fruitful
in
resource
of
great
experience
in
emergencies
astute
and
why
this
is
even
more
serious
than
a
a
great
deal
more
serious
it
would
be
easy
to
fight
with
another
man
with
women
with
unseen
enemies
who
work
in
the
dark
it
is
come
i
am
all
pinzon
lay
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
bed
pepe
rey
drew
a
chair
up
to
the
bedside
and
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
bed
and
his
head
on
his
hand
began
his
conference
consultation
exposition
of
plan
or
whatever
else
it
might
be
called
and
continued
talking
for
a
long
time
pinzon
listened
to
him
with
profound
attention
and
without
interrupting
him
except
to
ask
an
occasional
question
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
further
details
or
additional
light
upon
some
obscure
point
when
pepe
rey
ended
pinzon
looked
grave
he
stretched
himself
yawning
with
the
satisfaction
of
one
who
has
not
slept
for
three
nights
and
then
said
you
plan
is
dangerous
and
but
not
oh
no
for
nothing
is
impossible
reflect
well
about
i
have
and
you
are
resolved
to
carry
it
through
consider
that
these
things
are
not
now
in
fashion
they
generally
turn
out
badly
and
throw
discredit
on
those
who
undertake
i
am
for
my
part
then
although
the
business
is
dangerous
and
serious
very
serious
i
am
ready
to
aid
you
in
all
things
and
for
all
can
i
rely
upon
you
to
the
chapter
xix
a
terrible
the
opening
of
hostilities
could
not
long
be
delayed
when
the
hour
of
dinner
arrived
after
coming
to
an
agreement
with
pinzon
regarding
the
plan
to
be
pursued
the
first
condition
of
which
was
that
the
friends
should
pretend
not
to
know
each
other
pepe
rey
went
to
the
there
he
found
his
aunt
who
had
just
returned
from
the
cathedral
where
she
had
spent
the
morning
as
was
her
habit
she
was
alone
and
appeared
to
be
greatly
preoccupied
the
engineer
observed
that
on
that
pale
and
countenance
not
without
a
certain
beauty
there
rested
a
mysterious
shadow
when
she
looked
up
it
recovered
its
sinister
calmness
but
she
looked
up
seldom
and
after
a
rapid
examination
of
her
nephew
s
countenance
that
of
the
amiable
lady
would
again
take
on
its
studied
gloom
they
awaited
dinner
in
silence
they
did
not
wait
for
don
cayetano
for
he
had
gone
to
mundogrande
when
they
sat
down
to
table
dona
perfecta
said
and
that
fine
soldier
whom
the
government
has
sent
us
is
he
not
coming
to
dinner
he
seems
to
be
more
sleepy
than
hungry
answered
the
engineer
without
looking
at
his
aunt
do
you
know
him
i
have
never
seen
him
in
all
my
life
we
are
nicely
off
with
the
guests
whom
the
government
sends
us
we
have
beds
and
provisions
in
order
to
keep
them
ready
for
those
vagabonds
of
madrid
whenever
they
may
choose
to
dispose
of
there
are
fears
of
an
insurrection
said
pepe
rey
with
sudden
heat
and
the
government
is
determined
to
crush
the
orbajosans
to
crush
them
to
grind
them
to
stop
man
stop
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
crush
us
cried
dona

sarcastically
poor
we
be
merciful
man
and
allow
us
unhappy
creatures
to
live
and
would
you
then
be
one
of
those
who
would
aid
the
army
in
the
grand
work
of
crushing
us
i
am
not
a
soldier
i
will
do
nothing
but
applaud
when
i
see
the
germs
of
civil
war
of
insubordination
of
discord
of
disorder
of
robbery
and
of
barbarism
that
exist
here
to
the
shame
of
our
times
and
of
our
country
forever
all
will
be
as
god
orbajosa
my
dear
aunt
has
little
else
than
garlic
and
bandits
for
those
who
in
the
name
of
some
political
or
religious
idea
set
out
in
search
of
adventures
every
four
or
five
years
are
nothing
but
thanks
thanks
my
dear
nephew
said
dona
perfecta
turning
pale
so
orbajosa
has
nothing
more
than
that
yet
there
must
be
something
else
here
something
that
you
do
not
possess
since
you
have
come
to
look
for
it
among
rey
felt
the
cut
his
soul
was
on
fire
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
show
his
aunt
the
consideration
to
which
her
sex
her
rank
and
her
relation
to
himself
entitled
her
he
was
on
the
verge
of
a
violent
outbreak
and
a
force
that
he
could
not
resist
was
impelling
him
against
his
interlocutor
i
came
to
orbajosa
he
said
because
you
sent
for
me
you
arranged
with
my
father
yes
yes
it
is
true
she
answered
interrupting
him
quickly
and
making
an
effort
to
recover
her
habitual
serenity
i
do
not
deny
it
i
am
the
one
who
is
really
to
blame
i
am
to
blame
for
your

the
slights
you
put
upon
us
for
every
thing
disagreeable
that
has
been
happening
in
my
house
since

am
glad
that
you
are
conscious

also
go
down
on

me
in
so
pitiless
a
manner
i
can
not

all
i
have
said
is
that
i
came
to
orbajosa
at
your
and
it
is

and
i
arranged
that
you
should
marry

pretended
to
accept
me
as

receiving
me
with
deceitful
cordiality
you
employed
from
the
very
beginning
all
the
arts
of
cunning
to
thwart
me
and
to
prevent
the
fulfilment
of
the
proposals
made
to

determined
from
the
first
day
to
drive
me
to
desperation
to
tire
me
out
and
with
smiles
and
affectionate
words
on
your
lips
you
have
been
killing
me
roasting
me
at
the
slow
fire
you
have
let
loose
upon
me
in
the
dark
and
from
behind
an
ambush
a
swarm
of
lawsuits
you
have
deprived
me
of
the
official
commission
which
i
brought
to
orbajosa
you
have
brought
me
into

in

had
me
turned
out
of
the

have
kept
me
constantly
separated
from

scarlet

the

of

passed
away

indicative

it
possible

on

that
his

sobbing
bitterly
and
shedding
abundant
tears
in
spite
of
his
conviction
he
could
not
altogether
conquer
the
feeling
of
compassion
which
took
possession
of
him
and
while
he
condemned
himself
for
his
cowardice
he
felt
something
of
remorse
for
the
severity
and
the
frankness
with
which
he
had
spoken
my
dear
aunt
he
said
putting
his

on
her

you

me
with

perplexed

then
no
i
do
not
deny
the
engineer
was
astounded
i
do
not
deny
them
continued
dona

what
i
deny
is
the
evil
intention
which
you
attribute
to
them
by
what
right
do
you
undertake
to
judge
of
what
you
know
only
from
appearances
and
by
conjecture
have
you
the
supreme
intelligence
which
is
necessary
to
judge
justly
the
actions
of
others
and
pronounce
sentence
upon
them
are
you
god
to
know
the
intentions
pepe
was
every
moment
more
amazed
is
it
not
allowable
at
times
to
employ
indirect
means
to
attain
a
good
and
honorable
end
by
what
right
do
you
judge
actions
of
mine
that
you
do
not
clearly
understand
i
my
dear
nephew
manifesting
a
sincerity
which
you
do
not
deserve
confess
to
you
that
i
have
indeed
employed
subterfuges
to
attain
a
good
end
to
attain
what
was
at
the
same
time
beneficial
to
you
and
to
my
daughter
you
do
not
comprehend
you
look
bewildered
ah
your
great
mathematician

and
german
philosopher
s
intellect
is
not
capable
of
comprehending
these
artifices
of
a
prudent
i
am
more
and
more
astounded
every
moment
said
the
engineer
be
as
astounded
as
you
choose
but
confess
your
barbarity
said
the
lady
with
increasing
spirit
acknowledge
your
hastiness
and
your
brutal
conduct
toward
me
in
accusing
me
as
you
have
done
you
are
a
young
man
without
any
experience
or
any
other
knowledge
than
that
which
is
derived
from
books
which
teach
nothing
about
the
world
or
the
human
heart
all
you
know
is
how
to
make
roads
and
docks
ah
my
young
gentleman
one
does
not
enter
into
the
human
heart
through
the
tunnel
of
a
railroad
or
descend
into
its
depths
through
the
shaft
of
a
mine
you
can
not
read
in
the
conscience
of
another
with
the
microscope
of
a
naturalist
nor
decide
the
question
of
another
s
culpability
measuring
ideas
with
a

dear

why
do
you
pronounce
the
name
of
god
when
you
do
not
believe
in
him
said

in
solemn
accents
if
you

explanations

to

so
nor
would
you
understand
me
if
i
should
tell
you
that
i
desired
to
attain
my
object
without
scandal
without
offending
your
father
without
offending
you
without
giving
cause
for
people
to
talk
by
an
explicit
refusal
i
will
say
nothing
of
all
this
to
you
for
you
would
not
understand
it
either
pepe
you
are
a
mathematician
you
see
what
is
before
your

and
nothing
more
brute
matter
and
nothing

you
see
the
effect
and
not
the
cause
god
is
the
supreme
intention
of
the

he
who
does
not
know
this
must
necessarily
judge
things
as
you
judge
them
foolishly
in
the
tempest
for

only
destruction
in
the

famine
in

we
are
to
seek
the

yes
senor
the
intention
always
good
of
him
who
can
do
nothing
this
confused
subtle
and
mystic
logic
did
not
convince
pepe
rey
but
he
did
not
wish
to
follow
his
aunt
in
the
tortuous
path
of
such
a
method
of
reasoning
and
he
said
simply
well
i
respect
now
that
you
seem
to
recognize
your
error
continued
the
pious
lady
with
confidence
i
will
make
another
confession
to
you
and
that
is
that
i
see
now
that
i
did
wrong
in
adopting
the
course
i
did
although
my
object
was
excellent
in
view
of
your
impetuous
disposition
in
view
of
your
incapacity
to
comprehend
me
i
should
have
faced
the
situation
boldly
and
said
to
you
nephew
i
do
not
wish
that
you
should
be

that
is
the
language
you
should
have
used

me

the

drawing
a
deep
breath
as
if
his

had
been
relieved
from
an
enormous
weight
i

obliged
to
you

those
words
after
having
been
stabbed
in
the
dark
this
blow
on
the

in
the
light
of

is
a
great
satisfaction
to
well
i
will
repeat
the
blow

the

with
composure
not

by
the

at
which

that
of
anathema
incarnated
in
a

remained
seated
serene
courageous
with
the
passive
courage
of
a
profound
conviction
and
an
immovable
resolve
the
whole
weight
of
his

wrath
threatening
to
overwhelm
him

not
make

his

gravely
rising
to
his
feet
and
pointing
with
outstretched
arm
to
the
heavens
i
say
and
i
repeat
that

is
pepe
rey
s
composure
was
so
to
say
the
arrogant
display
of
invincible
and
conscious
strength
the
blows
he
gave
were
hard
and
crushing
in
their
force
without
any
thing
to
mitigate
their
severity
his
words
if
the
comparison
may
be
allowed
were
like
a
pitiless
discharge
of
artillery
dona

sank
again
on
the
sofa
but
she
shed
no
tears
and
a
convulsive
tremor
agitated
her
frame
so
that
for
this
infamous
atheist
she
exclaimed
with
frank
rage
there
are
no
social
conventionalities
there
is
nothing
but
caprice
this
is
base
avarice
my
daughter
is
rich
if
you
think
to
wound
me
with
that
treacherous
weapon
evading
the
question
and
giving
a
distorted
meaning
to
my
sentiments
in
order
to
offend
my
dignity
you
are
mistaken
dear
aunt
call
me
mercenary
if
you
choose
god

what
i
you
have
no
dignity
that
is
an
opinion
like
any
other
the
world
may
hold
you
to
be
infallible
i
do
not
i
am
far
from
believing
that
from
your
judgments
there
is
no
appeal
to
but
is
what
you
say
true
but
do
you
persist
in
your
purpose
after
my
refusal
you
respect
nothing
you
are
a
monster

i
am
a
a
wretch
let
us

this
at
once

suddenly
to
her

coxcomb
do
you
suppose
that
my
daughter
thinks
of
you
she
loves
me
as
i
love
it
is
a
lie
it

a
lie
she
herself
has
told
me
so
excuse
me
if
on
this
point
i
put
more
faith
in
her
words
than
in
her
mother
how
could
she
have
told
you
so
when
you
have
not
seen
her
for
several
days
i
saw
her
last
night
and
she
swore
to
me
before
the
crucifix
in
the
chapel
that
she
would
be
my
oh
scandal
oh
libertinism
but
what
is
this

your
school
my
intention

and
she
came
down
stairs

morning
at
daybreak
i
surprised

in
her
room
she
told
me

had
gone
out

for
what
you
were
the
real
criminal
then
this
is
a
disgrace
pepe
i
expected

an
end
go

are
dead
to
me
i
forgive
you
provided

and
that

sufficient
for

silent
blasphemer
and
don
t
take
the
name
of

upon
your
lips
exclaimed
dona

in
the
name
of

can
invoke

i
believe
in
him
i
tell
you
that
my

living
hell

be
a
hell
rosario
will
be
my
wife
repeated
the
mathematician
with
pathetic
calmness
the
pious
lady
was
still
more
exasperated
by
her
nephew
s
calm
energy
in
a
broken
voice
she
said
don
t
suppose
that
your
threats
terrify
me
i
know
what
i
am
saying
what
are
a
home
and
a
family
to
be
outraged
like
this
are
human
and
divine
authority
to
be
trampled
under
foot
in
this
way
i
will
trample
every
thing
under
foot
said
the
engineer
beginning
to
lose
his
composure
and
speaking
with
some
agitation
you
will
trample
every
thing
under
foot
ah
it
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
a
barbarian
a
savage
a
man
who
lives
by
no
dear
aunt
i
am
mild
upright
honorable
and
an
enemy
to
violence
but
between
you
and
me
between
you
who
are
the
law
and
i
who
am
to
honor
it
is
a
poor
tormented
creature
one
of
god
s
angels
subjected
to
iniquitous
tortures
the
spectacle
of
this
injustice
this
violence
is
what
has
converted
my
rectitude
into
barbarity
my
reason
into
brute
force
my
honor
into
violence
like
an
assassin
s
or
a
thief
s
this
spectacle
senora
is
what
impels
me
to
disregard
your
law
what
impels
me
to
trample
it
under
foot
braving
every
thing
this
which
appears
to
you
lawlessness
is
obedience
to
an
unescapable
law
i
do
what
society
does
when
a
brutal
power
as
illogical
as
irritating
opposes
its
progress
it
tramples
it
under
foot
and
destroys
it
in
an
outburst
of
frenzy
such
am
i
at
this
moment
i
do
not
recognize
myself
i
was
reasonable
and
now
i
am
a
brute
i
was
respectful
and
now
i
am
insolent
i
was
civilized
and
now
i
am
a
savage
you
have
brought
me
to
this
horrible
extremity
infuriating
me
and
driving
me
from
the
path
of
rectitude
which
i
was
tranquilly
pursuing
who
is
to
blame
i
or
you
you
you
neither
you
nor
i
can
decide
the
question
i
think
we
are
both
to
blame
you
for
your
violence
and
injustice
i
for
my
injustice
and
violence
we
have
both
become
equally
barbarous
and
we
struggle
with
and
wound
each
other
without
compassion
god
has
permitted
that
it
should
be
so
my
blood
will
be
upon
your
conscience
yours
will
be
upon
mine
enough

trouble
you
with
useless
words

cried
pointing
with
an
energetic
gesture
to
the
door
pepe

left
the
room
dona

after
pronouncing
a
few
incoherent
words
which
were
the
clearest
expression
of
her
anger
sank
into
a
chair
with
indications
of
fatigue
or
of
a
coming
attack
of
nerves
the
maids
came
running
in

for

chapter

rumors
fears
on
the
day
following
that
of
this
lamentable
quarrel
various
rumors
regarding
pepe
rey
and
his
conduct
spread
through
orbajosa
going
from
house
to
house
from
club
to
club
from
the
casino
to
the
apothecary
s
and
from
the
paseo
de
las
descalzes
to
the
puerta
de
baidejos
they
were
repeated
by
every
body
and
so
many
were
the
comments
made
that
if
don
cayetano
had
collected
and
compiled
them
he
might
have
formed
with
them
a
rich
thesaurus
of
orbajosan
benevolence
in
the
midst
of
the
diversity
of
the
reports
circulated
there
was
agreement
in
regard
to
certain
important
particulars
one
of
which
was
the
following
that
the
engineer
enraged
at
dona
perfecta
s
refusal
to
marry
rosario
to
an
atheist
had
raised
his
hand
to
his
aunt
the
young
man
was
living
in
the
widow
de
cusco
s
hotel
an
establishment
mounted
as
they
say
now
not
at
the
height
but
at
the
depth
of
the
superlative
backwardness
of
the
town
pinzon
visited
him
with
frequency
in
order
that
they
might
discuss
together
the
plot
which
they
had
on
hand
and
for
the
successful
conduct
of
which
the
soldier
showed
the
happiest
dispositions
new
artifices
and
stratagems
occurred
to
him
at
every
instant
and
he
hastened
to
put
them
into
effect
with
excellent
humor
although
he
would
often
say
to
his
friend
the
role
i
am
playing
dear
pepe
is
not
a
very
dignified
one
but
to
give
an
annoyance
to
the
orbajosans
i
would
walk
on
my
hands
and
we
do
not
know
what
cunning
stratagems
the
artful
soldier
skilled
in
the
wiles
of
the
world
employed
but
certain
it
is
that
before
he
had
been
in
the
house
three
days
he
had
succeeded
in
making
himself
greatly
liked
by
every
body
in
it
his
manners
were
very
pleasing
to
dona
perfecta
who
could
not
hear
unmoved
his
flattering
praises
of
the
elegance
of
the
house
and
of
the
nobility
piety
and
august
magnificence
of
its
mistress
with
don
inocencio
he
was
hand
and
glove
neither
her
mother
nor
the
penitentiary
placed
any
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
speaking
with
rosario
who
had
been
restored
to
liberty
on
the
departure
of
her
ferocious
cousin
and
with
his
delicate
compliments
his
skilful
flattery
and
great
address
he
had
acquired
in
the
house
of
polentinos
considerable
ascendency
and
he
had
even
succeeded
in
establishing
himself
in
it
on
a
footing
of
familiarity
but
the
object
of
all
his
arts
was
a
servant
maid
named
librada
whom
he
had
seduced
chastely
speaking
that
she
might
carry
messages
and
notes
to
rosario
of
whom
he
pretended
to
be
enamored
the
girl
allowed
herself
to
be
bribed
with
persuasive
words
and
a
good
deal
of
money
because
she
was
ignorant
of
the
source
of
the
notes
and
of
the
real
meaning
of
the
intrigue
for
had
she
known
that
it
was
all
a
diabolical
plot
of
don
jose
although
she
liked
the
latter
greatly
she
would
not
have
acted
with
treachery
toward
her
mistress
for
all
the
money
in
the
world
one
day
dona
perfecta
don
inocencio
jacinto
and
pinzon
were
conversing
together
in
the
garden
they
were
talking
about
the
soldiers
and
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
been
sent
to
orbajosa
in
which
the
penitentiary
found
motive
for
condemning
the
tyrannical
conduct
of
the
government
and
without
knowing
how
it
came
about
pepe
rey
s
name
was
mentioned
he
is
still
at
the
hotel
said
the
little
lawyer
i
saw
him
yesterday
and
he
gave
me
remembrances
for
you
dona
was
there
ever
seen
such
insolence
ah
senor
pinzon
do
not
be
surprised
at
my
using
this
language
speaking
of
my
own
nephew
that
young
man
you
remember
who
had
the
room
which
you
yes
i
know
i
am
not
acquainted
with
him
but
i
know
him
by
sight
and
by
reputation
he
is
an
intimate
friend
of
our
an
intimate
friend
of
the
brigadier
yes
senor
of
the
commander
of
the
brigade
that
has
just
arrived
in
this
district
and
which
is
quartered
in
the
neighboring
and
where
is
he
asked
the
lady
in
i
think
he
is
stopping
at
polavieja
s
observed
jacinto
your
nephew
and
brigadier
batalla
are
intimate
friends
continued
pinzon
they
are
always
to
be
seen
together
in
the
well
my
friend
that
gives
me
a
bad
idea
of
your
chief
said
dona
perfecta
he
is
he
is
very
said
pinzon
in
the
tone
of
one
who
through
motives
of
respect
did
not
venture
to
use
a
harsher
word
with
your
permission
senor
pinzon
and
making
an
honorable
exception
in
your
favor
it
must
be
said
that
in
the
spanish
army
there
are
some
curious
types
our
brigadier
was
an
excellent
soldier
before
he
gave
himself
up
to
to
spiritualism
that
sect
that
calls
up
ghosts
and
goblins
by
means
of
the
legs
of
a
table
said
the
canon
laughing
from
curiosity
only
from
curiosity
said
jacintillo
with
emphasis
i
ordered
allan
kardec
s
book
from
madrid
it
is
well
to
know
something
about
every
but
is
it
possible
that
such
follies
heavens
tell
me
pinzon
does
my
nephew
too
belong
to
that
sect
of
i
think
it
was
he
who
indoctrinated
our
valiant
brigadier
good
heavens
yes
and
whenever
he
chooses
said
don
inocencio
unable
to
contain
his
laughter
he
can
speak
to
socrates
paul
cervantes
or
descartes
as
i
speak
to
librada
to
ask
her
for
a
match
poor
senor
de
rey
i
was
not
mistaken
in
saying
that
there
was
something
wrong
in
his
outside
that
continued
pinzon
our
brigadier
is
a
good
soldier
if
he
errs
at
all
it
is
on
the
side
of
severity
he
takes
the
orders
of
the
government
so
literally
that
if
he
were
to
meet
with
much
opposition
here
he
would
be
capable
of
not
leaving
one
stone
upon
another
in
orbajosa
yes
i
advise
you
all
to
be
on
your
but
is
that
monster
going
to
cut
all
our
heads
off
then
ah
senor
don
inocencio
these
visits
of
the
army
remind
me
of
what
i
have
read
in
the
lives
of
the
martyrs
about
the
visits
of
the
roman
proconsuls
to
a
christian
the
comparison
is
not
wanting
in
exactness
said
the
penitentiary
looking
at
the
soldier
over
his
spectacles
it
is
not
very
agreeable
but
if
it
is
the
truth
why
should
it
not
be
said
observed
pinzon
benevolently
now
you
all
are
at
our
the
authorities
of
the
place
objected
jacinto
still
exercise
their
functions
as
i
think
you
are
mistaken
responded
the
soldier
whose
countenance
dona
perfecta
and
the
penitentiary
were
studying
with
profound
interest
the
alcalde
of
orbajosa
was
removed
from
office
an
hour
by
the
governor
of
the
province
the
governor
of
the
province
has
been
replaced
by
a
delegate
from
the
government
who
was
to
arrive
this
morning
the
municipal
councils
will
all
be
removed
from
office
the
minister
has
so
ordered
because
he
suspected
i
don
t
know
on
what
grounds
that
they
were
not
supporting
the
central
this
is
a
pretty
state
of
things
murmured
the
canon
frowning
and
pushing
out
his
lower
lip
dona
perfecta
looked
thoughtful
some
of
the
judges
of
the
primary
court
among
them
the
judge
of
orbajosa
have
been
deprived
of
the
judge
periquito
periquito
is
no
longer
judge
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
in
a
voice
and
with
the
manner

not

you
know
who
will
be
the

they
say
a
corregidor
is
there

at
once
that
the
deluge
is
coming
and
let
us
be
done
with
it
said
the
canon
rising
so
that
we
are
at
the

mercy
for
a
few
days
only
don
t
be
angry
with
me
in
spite
of
my
uniform
i
am
an
enemy
of
militarism
but
we
are
ordered
to
strike
and
we
strike
there
could
not
be
a
viler
trade
than
that
it
is
that
it
is
said
dona
perfecta
with
difficulty
concealing
her
fury
now
that
you
have
confessed
it
so
then
neither

nor

nor
governor
of

them
take
the
bishop
from
us
also
and
send
us
a

is
all
that
is
wanting
if
the
people
here
will
allow
them
to
do
it
murmured
don
inocencio
lowering
his
eyes
they
won
t
stop
at
and
it
is
all
because
they
are
afraid
of
an
insurrection

waving
them
up

down

don

know
why
it
is
that
even
the
very
stones
don
t

up

i
wish
you
no
harm

it
would
be
a
just
judgment
on
you
if
the
water
you

you
say
that
my

intimate

chapter

desperta
ferro
about
this
time
the
following
items
of
news
appeared
in
the
madrid
newspapers
there
is
no
truth
whatever
in
the
report
that
there
has
been
an
insurrection
in
the
neighborhood
of
orbajosa
our
correspondent
in
that
place
informs
us
that
the
country
is
so
little
disposed
for
adventures
that
the
further
presence
of
the
batalla
brigade
in
that
locality
is
considered
it
is
said
that
the
batalla
brigade
will
leave
orbajosa
as
troops
are
not
required
there
to
go
to
villajuan
de
nahara
where
guerillas
have
made
their
the
news
has
been
confirmed
that
the
aceros
with
a
number
of
mounted
followers
are
ranging
the
district
of
villajuan
adjacent
to
the
judicial
district
of
orbajosa
the
governor
of
the
province
of
has
telegraphed
to
the
government
that
francisco

entered
las
roquetas
where
he
demanded
provisions
and
money
domingo

was
ranging
the
jubileo

actively
pursued
by
the
civil
guards
who
killed
one
of
his
men
and
captured
another
bartolome
acero
is
the
man
who
burned
the
registry
office
of
lugarnoble
and
carried
away
with
him
as
hostages
the
alcalde
and
two
of
the
principal
complete
tranquillity
reigns
in
orbajosa
according
to
a
letter
which
we
have
before
us
and
no
one
there
thinks
of
anything
but
cultivating
the
garlic
fields
which
promise
to
yield
a
magnificent
crop
the
neighboring
districts
however
are
infested
with
guerillas
but
the
batalla
brigade
will
make
short
work
of
orbajosa
was
in
fact
tranquil
the
aceros
that
warlike
dynasty
worthy
in
the
opinion
of
some
of
figuring
in
the
romancero
had
taken
possession
of
the
neighboring
province
but
the
insurrection
was
not
spreading
within
the
limits
of
the
episcopal
city
it
might
be
supposed
that
modern
culture
had
at
last
triumphed
in
its
struggle
with
the
turbulent
habits
of
the
great
city
of
disorder
and
that
the
latter
was
tasting
the
delights
of
a
lasting
peace
so
true
is
this
that
caballuco
himself
one
of
the
most
important
figures
of
the
historic
rebellion
of
orbajosa
said
frankly
to
every
one
that
he
did
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
the
government
nor
involve
himself
in
a
business
which
might
cost
him
dear
whatever
may
be
said
to
the
contrary
the
impetuous
nature
of
ramos
had
quieted
down
with
years
and
the
fiery
temper
which
he
had
received
with
life
from
the
ancestral
caballucos
the
most
valiant
race
of
warriors
that
had
ever
desolated
the
earth
had
grown
cooler
it
is
also
related
that
in
those
days
the
new
governor
of
the
province
held
a
conference
with
this
important
personage
and
received
from
his
lips
the
most
solemn
assurances
that
he
would
contribute
as
far
as
in
him
lay
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
country
and
would
avoid
doing
any
thing
that
might
give
rise
to
disturbances
reliable
witnesses
declare
that
he
was
to
be
seen
in
friendly
companionship
with
the
soldiers
hobnobbing
with
this
sergeant
or
the
other
in
the
tavern
and
it
was
even
said
that
an
important
position
in
the
of
the
capital
of
the
province
was
to
be
given
him
how
difficult
it
is
for
the
historian
who
tries
to
be
impartial
to
arrive
at
the
exact
truth
in
regard
to
the
sentiments
and
opinions
of
the
illustrious
personages
who
have
filled
the
world
with
their
fame
he
does
not
know
what
to
hold
by
and
the
absence
of
authentic
records
often
gives
rise
to
lamentable
mistakes
considering
events
of
such
transcendent
importance
as
that
of
the
brumaire
the
sack
of
rome
by
bourbon
or
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
where
is
the
psychologist
or
the
historian
who
would
be
able
to
determine
what
were
the
thoughts
which
preceded
or
followed
them
in
the
minds
of
bonaparte
of
charles
and
of
titus
ours
is
an
immense
responsibility
to
discharge
it
in
part
we
will
report
words
phrases
and
even
discourses
of
the
orbajosan
emperor
himself
and
in
this
way
every
one
will
be
able
to
form
the
opinion
which
may
seem
to
him
most
correct
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
cristobal
ramos
left
his
house
just
after
dark
crossed
the
calle
del
condestable
and
seeing
three
countrymen
mounted
on
powerful
mules
coming
toward
him
asked
them
where
they
were
going
to
which
they
answered
that
they
were
going
to
senora
dona
perfecta
s
house
to
take
her
some
of
the
first
fruits
of
their
gardens
and
a
part
of
the
rent
that
had
fallen
due
they
were
senor
paso
largo
a
young
man
named
frasquito
gonzales
and
a
third
a
man
of
medium
stature
and
robust
make
who
was
called
vejarruco
although
his
real
name
was
jose
esteban
romero
caballuco
turned
back
tempted
by
the
agreeable
society
of
these
persons
who
were
old
and
intimate
friends
of
his
and
accompanied
them
to
dona
perfecta
s
house
this
took
place
according
to
the
most
reliable
accounts
at
nightfall
and
two
days
after
the
day
on
which
dona
perfecta
and
pinzon
held
the
conversation
which
those
who
have
read
the
preceding
chapter
will
have
seen
recorded
there
the
great
ramos
stopped
for
a
moment
to
give
librada
certain
messages
of
trifling
importance
which
a
neighbor
had
confided
to
his
good
memory
and
when
he
entered
the
he
found
the
three
countrymen
and
senor
licurgo
who
by
a
singular
coincidence
was
also
there
conversing
about
domestic
matters
and
the
crops
the
senora
was
in
a
detestable
humor
she
found
fault
with
every
thing
and
scolded
them
harshly
for
the
drought
of
the
heavens
and
the
barrenness
of
the
earth
phenomena
for
which
they
poor
men
were
in
no
wise
to
blame
the
penitentiary
was
also
present
when
caballuco
entered
the
good
canon
saluted
him
affectionately
and
motioned
him
to
a
seat
beside
himself
here
is
the
individual
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
disdainfully
it
seems
impossible
that
a
man
of
such
little
account
should
be
so
much
talked
about
tell
me
caballuco
is
it
true
that
one
of
the
soldiers
slapped
you
on
the
face
this
morning
me
me
said
the
centaur
rising
indignantly
as
if
he
had
received
the
grossest
insult
that
is
what
they
say
said
dona
perfecta
is
it
not
true
i
believed
it
for
any
one
who
thinks
so
little
of
himself
they
might
spit
in
your
face
and
you
would
think
yourself
honored
with
the
saliva
of
the
senora
vociferated
ramos
with
energy
saving
the
respect
which
i
owe
you
who
are
my
mother
my
mistress
my
queen
saving
the
respect
i
say
which
i
owe
to
the
person
who
has
given
me
all
that
i
possess
saving
the
respect
well
one
would
think
you
were
going
to
say
i
say
then
that
saving
the
respect
that
about
the
slap
is
a
slander
he
ended
expressing
himself
with
extraordinary
difficulty
my
affairs
are
in
every
one
s
mouth
whether
i
come
in
or
whether
i
go
out
where
i
am
going
and
where
i
have
come
from
and
why
all
because
they
want
to
make
me
a
tool
to
raise
the
country
pedro
is
contented
in
his
own
house
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
troops
have
come
bad
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
the
alcalde
and
the
secretary
and
the
judge
have
been
removed
from
office
very
bad
i
wish
the
very
stones
of
orbajosa
might
rise
up
against
them
but
i
have
given
my
word
to
the
governor
and
up
to
the
present
he
scratched
his
head
gathered
his
gloomy
brows
in
a
frown
and
with
difficulty
of
speech
continued
i
may
be
brutal
disagreeable
ignorant
quarrelsome
obstinate
and
every
thing
else
you
choose
but
in
honor
i
yield
to
no
what
a
pity
of
the
cid
campeador
said
dona
perfecta
contemptuously
don
t
you
agree
with
me
senor
penitentiary
that
there
is
not
a
single
man
left
in
orbajosa
who
has
any
shame
in
him
that
is
a
serious
view
to
take
of
the
case
responded
the
capitular
without
looking
at
his
friend
or
removing
from
his
chin
the
hand
on
which
he
rested
his
thoughtful
face
but
i
think
this
neighborhood
has
accepted
with
excessive
submission
the
heavy
yoke
of
licurgo
and
the
three
countrymen
laughed
boisterously
when
the
soldiers
and
the
new
authorities
said
dona
perfecta
have
taken
from
us
our
last
real
when
the
town
has
been
disgraced
we
will
send
all
the
valiant
men
of
orbajosa
in
a
glass
case
to
madrid
to
be
put
in
the
museum
there
or
exhibited
in
the
long
life
to
the
mistress
cried
the
man
called
vejarruco
demonstratively
what
she
says
is
like
gold
it
won
t
be
said
on
my
account
that
there
are
no
brave
men
here
for
if
i
am
not
with
the
aceros
it
is
only
because
i
have
a
wife
and
three
children
and
if
any
thing
was
to
happen
if
it
wasn
t
for
that
but
haven
t
you
given
your
word
to
the
governor
too
said
dona
perfecta
to
the
governor
cried
the
man
named
frasquito
gonzalez
there
is
not
in
the
whole
country
a
scoundrel
who
better
deserves
a
bullet
governor
and
government
they
are
all
of
a
piece
last
sunday
the
priest
said
so
many
rousing
things
in
his
sermon
about
the
heresies
and
the
profanities
of
the
people
of
madrid
oh
it
was
worth
while
hearing
him
finally
he
shouted
out
in
the
pulpit
that
religion
had
no
longer
any
here
is
the
great
cristobal
ramos
said
dona
perfecta
clapping
the
centaur
on
the
back
he
mounts
his
horse
and
rides
about
in
the
plaza
and
up
and
down
the
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
soldiers
when
they
see
him
they
are
terrified
at
the
fierce
appearance
of
the
hero
and
they
all
run
away
with
dona
perfecta
ended
with
an
exaggerated
laugh
which
the
profound
silence
of
her
hearers
made
still
more
irritating
caballuco
was
pale
senor
paso
largo
continued
the
lady
becoming
serious
when
you
go
home
send
me
your
son
bartolome
to
stay
here
i
need
to
have
brave
people
in
the
house
and
even
with
that
it
may
very
well
happen
that
some
fine
morning
my
daughter
and
myself
will
be
found
murdered
in
our
senora
exclaimed
every
one
senora
cried
caballuco
rising
to
his
feet
is
that
a
jest
or
what
is
it
senor
vejarruco
senor
paso
largo
continued
dona
perfecta
without
looking
at
the
bravo
of
the
place
i
am
not
safe
in
my
own
house
no
one
in
orbajosa
is
and
least
of
all
i
live
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
can
not
close
my
eyes
in
the
whole
but
who
who
would
dare
come
exclaimed
licurgo
with
fire
i
old
and
sick
as
i
am
would
be
capable
of
fighting
the
whole
spanish
army
if
a
hair
of
the
mistress
head
should
be
touched
senor
caballuco
said
frasquito
gonzalez
will
be
enough
and
more
than
oh
no
responded
dona
perfecta
with
cruel
sarcasm
don
t
you
see
that
ramos
has
given
his
word
to
the
governor
caballuco
sat
down
again
and
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
clasped
his
hands
on
them
a
coward
will
be
enough
for
me
continued
the
mistress
of
the
house
implacably
provided
he
has
not
given
his
word
to
any
one
perhaps
i
may
come
to
see
my
house
assaulted
my
darling
daughter
torn
from
my
arms
myself
trampled
under
foot
and
insulted
in
the
vilest
manner
she
was
unable
to
continue
her
voice
died
away
in
her
throat
and
she
burst
into
tears
senora
for
heaven
s
sake
calm
yourself
come
there
is
no
cause
yet
said
don
inocencio
hastily
and
manifesting
the
greatest
distress
in
his
voice
and
his
countenance
besides
we
must
have
a
little
resignation
and
bear
patiently
the
calamities
which
god
sends
but
who
senora
who
would
dare
to
commit
such
outrages
asked
one
of
the
four
countrymen
orbajosa
would
rise
as
one
man
to
defend
the
but
who
who
would
do
it
they
all
repeated
there
don
t
trouble
yourselves
asking
useless
questions
said
the
penitentiary
officiously
you
may
no
no
let
them
stay
said
dona
perfecta
quickly
drying
her
tears
the
company
of
my
loyal
servants
is
a
great
consolation
to
may
my
race
be
accursed
said
uncle
licurgo
striking
his
knee
with
his
clenched
hand
if
all
this
mess
is
not
the
work
of
the
mistress
own
of
don
juan
rey
s
son
from
the
moment
i
first
set
eyes
on
him
at
the
station
at
villahorrenda
and
he
spoke
to
me
with
his
honeyed
voice
and
his
mincing
manners
declared
licurgo
i
thought
him
a
great
i
will
not
say
what
through
respect
for
the
mistress
but
i
knew
him
i
put
my
mark
upon
him
from
that
moment
and
i
make
no
mistakes
a
thread
shows
what
the
ball
is
as
the
saying

a
sample
tells
what
the

is

no

ill
of
that
unhappy
young
man
in
my
presence
said
senora
de
polentinos
severely
no
matter
how
great
his
faults
may
be
charity
forbids
our
speaking
of
them
and
giving
them
but
charity
said
don
inocencio
with
some
energy
does
not
forbid
us
protecting
ourselves
against
the
wicked
and
that
is
what
the
question
is
since
character
and
courage
have
sunk
so
low
in
unhappy
orbajosa
since
our
town
appears
disposed
to
hold
up
its
face
to
be
spat
upon
by
half
a
dozen
soldiers
and
a
corporal
let
us
find
protection
in
union
among
i
will
protect
myself
in
whatever
way
i
can
said
dona

resignedly
clasping
her

god

will
be
done
such
a
stir
about
nothing
by
the
lord
in
this
house
they
are
all
afraid
of
their
shadows
exclaimed
caballuco
half
seriously
half
jestingly
one
would
think
this
don
pepito
was
a
legion
of
devils
don
t
be
frightened
senora
my
little
nephew
juan
who
is
thirteen
will
guard
the
house
and
we
shall
see
nephew
for
nephew
which
is
the
best
we
all
know
already
what
your
boasting
and
bragging
signify
replied
dona
perfecta
poor
ramos
you
want
to
pretend
to
be
very
brave
when
we
have
already
had
proof
that
you
are
not
worth
any
ramos
turned
slightly
pale
while
he
fixed
on
dona
perfecta
a
strange
look
in
which
terror
and
respect
were
blended
yes
man
don
t
look
at
me
in
that
way
you
know
already
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
bugaboos
do
you
want
me
to
speak
plainly
to
you
now
well
you
are
a
ramos
moving
about
restlessly
in
his
chair
like
one
who
is
troubled
with
the
itch
seemed
greatly
disturbed
his
nostrils
expelled
and
drew
in
the
air
like
those
of
a
horse
within
that
massive
frame
a
storm
of
rage
and
fury
roaring
and
destroying
struggled
to
escape
after
stammering
a
few
words
and
muttering
others
under
his
breath
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
bellowed
i
will
cut
off
the
head
of
senor
rey
what
folly
you
are
as
brutal
as
you
are
cowardly
said
dona
perfecta
turning
pale
why
do
you
talk
about
killing
i
want
no
one
killed
much
less
my
nephew
a
person
whom
i
love
in
spite
of
his
a
homicide
what
an
atrocity
exclaimed
don
inocencio
scandalized
the
man
is
mad
to
kill
the
very
idea
of
killing
a
man
horrifies
me
caballuco
said
dona
perfecta
closing
her
mild
eyes
poor
man
ever
since
you
have
been
wanting
to
show
your
bravery
you
have
been
howling
like
a
ravening
wolf
go
away
ramos
you
terrify
doesn
t
the
mistress
say
she
is
afraid
doesn
t
she
say
that
they
will
attack
the
house
that
they
will
carry
off
the
young
lady
yes
i
fear
and
one
man
is
going
to
do
that
said
ramos
contemptuously
sitting
down
again
don
pepe
poquita
cosa
with
his
mathematics
is
going
to
do
that
i
did
wrong
in
saying
i
would
slit
his
throat
a
doll
of
that
kind
one
takes
by
the
ear
and
ducks
in
the
yes
laugh
now
you
fool
it
is
not
my
nephew
alone
who
is
going
to
commit
the
outrages
you
have
mentioned
and
which
i
fear
if
it
were
he
alone
i
should
not
fear
him
i
would
tell
librada
to
stand
at
the
door
with
a
broom
and
that
would
be
sufficient
it
is
not
he
alone
no
who
then
pretend
you
don
t
understand
don
t
you
know
that
my
nephew
and
the
brigadier
who
commands
that
accursed
troop
have
been
confabulating
confabulating
repeated
caballuco
as
if
puzzled
by
the
word
that
they
are
bosom
friends
said
licurgo
confabulate
means
to
be
like
bosom
friends
i
had
my
suspicions
already
of
what
the
mistress
it
all
amounts
to
this
that
the
brigadier
and
the
officers
are
hand
and
glove
with
don
jose
and
what
he
wants
those
brave
soldiers
want
and
those
brave
soldiers
will
commit
all
kinds
of
outrages
and
atrocities
because
that
is
their
and
we
have
no
alcalde
to
protect
nor
nor
governor
that
is
to
say
that
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
that
infamous
yesterday
said
vejarruco
some
soldiers
enticed
away
uncle
julian
s
youngest
daughter
and
the
poor
thing
was
afraid
to
go
back
home
they
found
her
standing
barefooted
beside
the
old
fountain
crying
and
picking
up
the
pieces
of
her
broken
poor
don
gregorio
palomeque
the
notary
of
naharilla
alta
said
frasquito
those
rascals
robbed
him
of
all
the
money
he
had
in
his
house
and
all
the
brigadier
said
when
he
was
told
about
it
was
it
was
a
tyrants
greater
tyrants
were
never
born
said
the
other
when
i
say
that
it
is
through
punctilio
that
i
am
not
with
the
aceros
and
what
news
is
there
of
francisco
acero
asked
dona
perfecta
gently
i
should
be
sorry
if
any
mischance
were
to
happen
to
him
tell
me
don
inocencio
was
not
francisco
acero
born
in
orbajosa
no
he
and
his
brother
are
from
i
am
sorry
for
it
for
orbajosa
s
sake
said
dona
perfecta
this
poor
city
has
fallen
into
misfortune
do
you
know
if
francisco
acero
gave
his
word
to
the
governor
not
to
trouble
the
poor
soldiers
in
their
abductions
in
their
impious
deeds
in
their
sacrilegious
acts
in
their
villanies
caballuco
sprang
from
his
chair
he
felt
himself
now
not
stung
but
cut
to
the
quick
by
a
cruel
stroke
like
that
of
a
sabre
with
his
face
burning
and
his
eyes
flashing
fire
he
cried
i
gave
my
word
to
the
governor
because
the
governor
told
me
that
they
had
come
for
a
good
barbarian
don
t
shout
speak
like
other
people
and
we
will
listen
to
i
promised
that
neither
i
nor
any
of
my
friends
would
raise
guerillas
in
the
neighborhood
of
orbajosa
to
those
who
wanted
to
take
up
arms
because
they
were
itching
to
fight
i
said
go
to
the
aceros
for
here
we
won
t
but
i
have
a
good
many
honest
men
yes
senora
and
true
men
yes
senora
and
valiant
men
yes
senora
scattered
about
in
the
hamlets
and
villages
and
in
the
suburbs
and
the
mountains
each
in
his
own
house
eh
and
so
soon
as
i
say
a
quarter
of
a
word
to
them
eh
they
will
be
taking
down
their
guns
eh
and
setting
out
on
horseback
or
on
foot
for
whatever
place
i
tell
them
and
don
t
keep
harping
on
words
for
if
i
gave
my
word
it
was
because
i
don
t
wish
to
fight
and
if
i
want
guerillas
there
will
be
guerillas
and
if
i
don
t
there
won
t
for
i
am
who
i
am
the
same
man
that
i
always
was
as
every
one
knows
very
well
and
i
say
again
don
t
keep
harping
on
words
eh
and
don
t
let
people
say
one
thing
to
me
when
they
mean
another
eh
and
if
people
want
me
to
fight
let
them
say
so
plainly
eh
for
that
is
what
god
has
given
us
tongues
for
to
say
this
thing
or
that
the
mistress
knows
very
well
who
i
am
as
i
know
that
i
owe
to
her
the
shirt
on
my
back
and
the
bread
i
eat
and
the
first
pea
i
sucked
after
i
was
weaned
and
the
coffin
in
which
my
father
was
buried
when
he
died
and
the
medicines
and
the
doctor
that
cured
me
when
i
was
sick
and
the
mistress
knows
very
well
that
if
she
says
to
me
caballuco
break
your
head
i
will
go
there
to
the
corner
and
dash
it
against
the
wall
the
mistress
knows
very
well
that
if
she
tells
me
now
that
it
is
day
although
i
see
that
it
is
night
i
will
believe
that
i
am
mistaken
and
that
it
is
broad
day
the
mistress
knows
very
well
that
she
and
her
interests
are
for
me
before
my
own
life
and
that
if
a
mosquito
stings
her
in
my
presence
i
pardon
it
because
it
is
a
mosquito
the
mistress
knows
very
well
that
she
is
dearer
to
me
than
all
there
is
besides
under
the
sun
to
a
man
of
heart
like
me
one
says
caballuco
you
stupid
fellow
do
this
or
do
and
let
there
be
an
end
to
sarcasms
and
beating
about
the
bush
and
preaching
one
thing
and
meaning
another
and
a
stab
here
and
a
pinch
there
man
calm
yourself
said
dona
perfecta
kindly
you
have
worked
yourself
into
a
heat
like
those
republican
orators
who
came
here
to
preach
free
religion
free
love
and
i
don
t
know
how
many
other
free
things
let
them
bring
you
a
glass
of
caballuco
twisting
his
handkerchief
into
a
ball
wiped
with
it
his
broad
forehead
and
his
neck
which
were
bathed
in
perspiration
a
glass
of
water
was
brought
to
him
and
the
worthy
canon
with
a
humility
that
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
sacerdotal
character
took
it
from
the
servant
s
hand
to
give
it
to
him
himself
and
held
the
plate
while
he
drank
caballuco
gulped
down
the
water
noisily
now
bring
another
glass
for
me
senora
librada
said
don
inocencio
i
have
a
little
fire
inside
me
chapter
xxii
desperta
with
regard
to
the
guerillas
said
dona
perfecta
when
they
had
finished
drinking
all
i
will
say
is
do
as
your
conscience
dictates
to
i
know
nothing
about
dictations
cried
ramos
i
will
do
whatever
the
mistress
pleases
i
can
give
you
no
advice
on
so
important
a
matter
answered
dona
perfecta
with
the
cautiousness
and
moderation
which
so
well
became
her
this
is
a
very
serious
business
and
i
can
give
you
no
advice
about
but
your
opinion
my
opinion
is
that
you
should
open
your
eyes
and
see
that
you
should
open
your
ears
and
hear
consult
your
own
heart
i
will
grant
that
you
have
a
great
heart
consult
that
judge
that
wise
counsellor
and
do
as
it
bids
caballuco
reflected
he
meditated
as
much
as
a
sword
can
meditate
we
counted
ourselves
yesterday
in
naharilla
alta
said
vejarruco
and
we
were
thirteen
ready
for
any
little
undertaking
but
as
we
were
afraid
the
mistress
might
be
vexed
we
did
nothing
it
is
time
now
for
the
don
t
mind
about
the
shearing
said
dona
perfecta
there
will
be
time
enough
for
it
it
won
t
be
left
undone
for
my
two
boys
quarrelled
with
each
other
yesterday
said
licurgo
because
one
of
them
wanted
to
join
francisco
acero
and
the
other
didn
t
easy
boys
easy
i
said
to
them
all
in
good
time
wait
we
know
how
to
fight
here
as
well
as
they
do
anywhere
last
night
said
uncle
paso
largo
roque
pelosmalos
told
me
that
the
moment
senor
ramos
said
half
a
word
they
would
all
be
ready
with
their
arms
in
their
hands
what
a
pity
that
the
two
burguillos
brothers
went
to
work
in
the
fields
in
lugarnoble
go
for
them
you
said
the
mistress
quickly
senor
lucas
do
you
provide
uncle
paso
largo
with
a
and
if
the
mistress
tells
me
to
do
so
and
senor
ramos
agrees
said
frasquito
gonzalez
i
will
go
to
villahorrenda
to
see
if
robustiano
the
forester
and
his
brother
pedro
will
also
i
think
that
is
a
good
idea
robustiano
will
not
venture
to
come
to
orbajosa
because
he
owes
me
a
trifle
you
can
tell
him
that
i
forgive
him
the
six
dollars
and
a
half
these
poor
people
who
sacrifice
themselves
with
so
little
is
it
not
so
senor
don
inocencio
our
good
ramos
here
tells
me
answered
the
canon
that
his
friends
are
displeased
with
him
for
his
lukewarmness
but
that
as
soon
as
they
see
that
he
has
decided
they
will
all
put
the
in
their
what
have
you
decided
to
take
to
the
roads
said
the
mistress
i
have
not
advised
you
to
do
any
such
thing
and
if
you
do
it
it
is
of
your
own
neither
has
senor
don
inocencio
said
a
word
to
you
to
that
effect
but
if
that
is
your
decision
you
have
no
doubt
strong
reasons
for
coming
to
it
tell
me
cristobal
will
you
have
some
supper
will
you
take
something
speak
as
far
as
my
advising
senor
ramos
to
take
the
field
is
concerned
said
don
inocencio
looking
over
his
spectacles
dona
perfecta
is
quite
right
i
as
an
ecclesiastic
could
advise
nothing
of
the
kind
i
know
that
some
priests
do
so
and
even
themselves
take
up
arms
but
that
seems
to
me
improper
very
improper
and
i
for
one
will
not
follow
their
example
i
carry
my
scrupulosity
so
far
as
not
to
say
a
word
to
senor
ramos
about
the
delicate
question
of
his
taking
up
arms
i
know
that
orbajosa
desires
it
i
know
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
noble
city
would
bless
him
for
it
i
know
that
deeds
are
going
to
be
done
here
worthy
of
being
recorded
in
history
but
notwithstanding
let
me
be
allowed
to
maintain
a
discreet
very
well
said
said
dona
perfecta
i
don
t
approve
of
ecclesiastics
taking
any
part
in
such
matters
that
is
the
way
an
enlightened
priest
ought
to
act
of
course
we
know
that
on
serious
and
solemn
occasions
as
when
our
country
and
our
faith
are
in
danger
for
instance
it
is
within
the
province
of
an
ecclesiastic
to
incite
men
to
the
conflict
and
even
to
take
a
part
in
it
since
god
himself
has
taken
part
in
celebrated
battles
under
the
form
of
angels
and
saints
his
ministers
may
very
well
do
so
also
during
the
wars
against
the
infidels
how
many
bishops
headed
the
castilian
troops
a
great
many
and
some
of
them
were
illustrious
warriors
but
these
times
are
not
like
those
senora
it
is
true
that
if
we
examine
the
matter
closely
the
faith
is
in
greater
danger
now
than
it
was
then
for
what
do
the
troops
that
occupy
our
city
and
the
surrounding
villages
represent
what
do
they
represent
are
they
any
thing
else
but
the
vile
instruments
of
which
the
atheists
and
protestants
who
infest
madrid
make
use
for
their
perfidious
conquests
and
the
extermination
of
the
faith
in
that
centre
of
corruption
of
scandal
of
irreligion
and
unbelief
a
few
malignant
men
bought
by
foreign
gold
occupy
themselves
in
destroying
in
our
spain
the
deeds
of
faith
why
what
do
you
suppose
they
allow
us
to
say
mass
and
you
to
hear
it
through
the
remnant
of
consideration
for
shame
s
sake
but
the
day
least
expected
for
my
part
i
am
tranquil
i
am
not
a
man
to
disturb
myself
about
any
worldly
and
temporal
interest
dona
perfecta
is
well
aware
of
that
all
who
know
me
are
aware
of
it
my
mind
is
at
rest
and
the
triumph
of
the
wicked
does
not
terrify
me
i
know
well
that
terrible
days
are
in
store
for
us
that
all
of
us
who
wear
the
sacerdotal
garb
have
our
lives
hanging
by
a
hair
for
spain
doubt
it
not
will
witness
scenes
like
those
of
the
french
revolution
in
which
thousands
of
pious
ecclesiastics
perished
in
a
single
day
but
i
am
not
troubled
when
the
hour
to
kill
strikes
i
will
present
my
neck
i
have
lived
long
enough
of
what
use
am
i
none
none
may
i
be
devoured
by
dogs
exclaimed
vejarruco
shaking
his
fist
which
had
all
the
hardness
and
the
strength
of
a
hammer
if
we
do
not
soon
make
an
end
of
that
thievish
rabble
they
say
that
next
week
they
will
begin
to
pull
down
the
cathedral
observed
frasquito
i
suppose
they
will
pull
it
down
with
pickaxes
and
hammers
said
the
canon
smiling
there
are
artificers
who
without
those
implements
can
build
more
rapidly
than
they
can
pull
down
you
all
know
that
according
to
holy
tradition
our
beautiful
chapel
of
the
sagrario
was
pulled
down
by
the
moors
in
a
month
and
immediately
afterward
rebuilt
by
the
angels
in
a
single
night
let
them
pull
it
down
let
them
pull
it
down
in
madrid
as
the
curate
of
naharilla
told
us
the
other
night
said
vejarruco
there
are
so
few
churches
left
standing
that
some
of
the
priests
say
mass
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
as
they
are
beaten
and
insulted
and
spat
upon
there
are
many
who
don
t
wish
to
say
fortunately
here
my
children
observed
don
inocencio
we
have
not
yet
had
scenes
of
that
nature
why
because
they
know
what
kind
of
people
you
are
because
they
have
heard
of
your
ardent
piety
and
your
valor
i
don
t
envy
the
first
ones
who
lay
hands
on
our
priests
and
our
religion
of
course
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
if
they
are
not
stopped
in
time
they
will
commit
atrocities
poor
spain
so
holy
and
so
meek
and
so
good
who
would
have
believed
she
would
ever
arrive
at
such
extremities
but
i
maintain
that
impiety
will
not
triumph
no
there
are
courageous
people
still
there
are
people
still
like
those
of
old
am
i
not
right
senor
ramos
yes
senor
that
there
are
answered
the
latter
i
have
a
blind
faith
in
the
triumph
of
the
law
of
god
some
one
must
stand
up
in
defence
of
it
if
not
one
it
will
be
another
the
palm
of
victory
and
with
it
eternal
glory
some
one
must
bear
the
wicked
will
perish
if
not
that
which
goes
against
the
law
of
god
will
fall
irremediably
let
it
be
in
this
manner
or
in
that
fall
it
must
neither
its
sophistries
nor
its
evasions
nor
its
artifices
will
save
it
the
hand
of
god
is
raised
against
it
and
will
infallibly
strike
it
let
us
pity
them
and
desire
their
repentance
as
for
you
my
children
do
not
expect
that
i
shall
say
a
word
to
you
about
the
step
which
you
are
no
doubt
going
to
take
i
know
that
you
are
good
i
know
that
your
generous
determination
and
the
noble
end
which
you
have
in
view
will
wash
away
from
you
all
the
stain
of
the
sin
of
shedding
blood
i
know
that
god
will
bless
you
that
your
victory
the
same
as
your
death
will
exalt
you
in
the
eyes
of
men
and
in
the
eyes
of
god
i
know
that
you
deserve
palms
and
glory
and
all
sorts
of
honors
but
in
spite
of
this
my
children
my
lips
will
not
incite
you
to
the
combat
they
have
never
done
it
and
they
will
not
do
it
now
act
according
to
the
impulse
of
your
own
noble
hearts
if
they
bid
you
to
remain
in
your
houses
remain
in
them
if
they
bid
you
to
leave
them
why
then
leave
them
i
will
resign
myself
to
be
a
martyr
and
to
bow
my
neck
to
the
executioner
if
that
vile
army
remains
here
but
if
a
noble
and
ardent
and
pious
impulse
of
the
sons
of
orbajosa
contributes
to
the
great
work
of
the
extirpation
of
our
country
s
ills
i
shall
hold
myself
the
happiest
of
men
solely
in
being
your
and
all
my
life
of
study
of
penitence
of
resignation
will
seem
to
me
less
meritorious
less
deserving
of

than
a
single
one

your

yours

to

of

dear
caballuco
seeing
you
seeing
your
bravery
and
your
nobility
there
come
to
my
mind
involuntarily
the
verses
of
that
ballad
on
the
conquest
of
the
empire
of
trebizond
came
the
valiant
roland
armed
at
every
point
on
his

the
gallant

his
good
sword

girded
to
his

couched
for
the

his
lance
on
his
arm
his
buckler
stout
through
his
helmet

visor
flashing
fire
he
came
quivering
like
a
slender
reed
shaken
by
the
wind
his
lance
and
all
the
host
united
defying
very
good
exclaimed
licurgo
clapping
his
hands
and
i
say
like
don
renialdos
let
none
the
wrath
of
don
renialdos
dare
brave
and
hope
to
escape
unscathed
for
he
who
seeks
with
him
a
quarrel
shall
pay
so
dearly
for
his
rashness
that

and
all
his

the

if
you
give
me
any

it

bursting
into
a
boisterous
laugh
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
several
times
attentively
observed
by
every
one
then
stopping
beside
the
group
he
looked
fixedly
at
dona

and
thundered
forth
these
words
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
long
live
orbajosa
death
to
madrid
and
he
brought
his
hand
down
on
the
table
with
such
violence
that
the
floor
shook
what
a
valiant
spirit
said
don

what
a
fist
you

every
one
was
looking
at
the

which
had
been
split
in

by
the
blow
then
they
looked
at
the
renialdos
or
caballuco
undoubtedly
there
was
in
his
handsome
countenance
in
his
green
eyes
animated
by
a
strange
feline
glow
in
his
black
hair
in
his
herculean
frame
a
certain
expression
and
air
of
grandeur
a
trace
or
rather
a
memory
of
the
grand
races
that
dominated
the
world
but
his
general
aspect
was
one
of
pitiable
degeneration
and
it
was
difficult
to
discover
the
noble
and
heroic
filiation
in
the
brutality
of
the
present
he
resembled
don

great

as
the

for

what

at

but
was

they
went
upstairs
and
came
down
again
they
went
up
a
second
time
and
came
down
again
carrying
a
light
and
looking
carefully
in
all
the
rooms
at
last
the
voice
of
the
penitentiary
was
heard
saying
joyfully
from
the
stairs
here

been
a
moment
later
mother
and

were
standing

a
severe
voice
scrutinizing
her

closely
in

at

made

the
consternation
and
the
apprehension
of
the
delinquent
what
is
this
where
were
you
asked
her
mistress
with
terrible
anger
why
senora
i
came
down
stairs
to
get
the
clothes
out
of
the
front

and
i

that
it
was

with
promptness
and
energy

and
the
canon
began
their
investigations
without
delay
questions
threats
entreaties
promises
were
skilfully
employed
to
discover
the
truth
regarding
what
had
happened
not
even
the
shadow
of
guilt
was
found
to
attach
to
the
old
servant
but
librada
confessed
frankly
between
tears
and
sighs
all
her
delinquencies
which
we
will
sum
up
as
follows
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
the
house
senor
pinzon
had
begun
to
cast
loving
glances
at
senorita
rosario
he
had
given
money
to
librada
according
to
what
the
latter
said
to
carry
messages
and
to
her
the
young
lady
had
not
seemed
angry
but
on
the
contrary
pleased
and
several
days
had
passed
in
this
manner
finally
the
servant
declared
that
rosario
and
senor
pinzon
had
agreed
to
meet
and
talk
with
each
other
on
this
night
at
the
window
of
the
room
of
the
latter
which
opened
on
the
garden
they
had
confided
their
design
to
the
maid
who
promised
to
favor
it
in
consideration
of
a
sum
which
was
at
once
given
her
it
had
been
agreed
that
senor
pinzon
was
to
leave
the
house
at
his
usual
hour
and
return
to
it
secretly
at
nine
o
clock
go
to
his
room
and
leave
it
and
the
house
again
clandestinely
also
a
little
later
to
return
without
concealment
at
his
usual
late
hour
in
this
way
no
suspicion
would
fall
upon
him
librada
had
waited
for
pinzon
who
had
entered
the
house
closely
enveloped
in
his
cloak
without
speaking
a
word
he
had
gone
to
his
room
at
the
same
moment
in
which
the
young
lady
descended
to
the
garden
during
the
interview
at
which
she
was
not
present
librada
had
remained
on
guard
in
the
hall
to
warn
pinzon
if
any
danger
should
threaten
and
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
latter
had
left
the
house
enveloped
in
his
cloak
as
before
and
without
speaking
a
word
when
the
confession
was
ended
don
inocencio
said
to
the
wretched
girl
are
you
sure
that
the
person
who
came
into
and
went
out
of
the
house
was
senor
pinzon
the
culprit
answered
nothing
but
her
features
expressed
the
utmost
perplexity
her
mistress
turned
green
with
anger
did
you
see
his
face
but
who
else
could
it
be
but
he
answered
the
maid
i
am
certain
that
it
was
he
he
went
straight
to
his
room
he
knew
the
way
to
it
perfectly
it
is
strange
said
the
canon
living
in
the
house
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
use
such
mystery
he
might
have
pretended
illness
and
remained
in
the
house
does
it
not
seem
so
to
you
senora
librada
exclaimed
the
latter
in
a
paroxysm
of
anger
i
vow
that
you
shall
go
to
and
clasping
her
hands
she
dug
the
nails
of
the
one
into
the
other
with
such
force
as
almost
to
draw
blood
senor
don
inocencio
she
exclaimed
let
us
die
there
is
no
remedy
but
to
then
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
inconsolable
weeping
courage

the
priest
in
a
moved
voice

on

rested
her
burning
forehead
in
darkness
in
solitude

in
silence
she
was
careful
not

not
to
attract
the
attention
of
her

was

priest

hate
my
mother

is
this
i
can
not
explain
it
to
myself
he
has
not
said
a
word
to
me
against
my
mother
i
do
not

how
this
is
come
to
pass
how
wicked
i
am

taken
possession
of
me
lord

to
my
help
for
with
my
own
strength

can
not
vanquish
myself
a
terrible
impulse
urges
me
to
leave
this
house
i
wish
to
escape
to
fly
from
it
if
he
does
not
take
me
i
will
drag
myself
after
him
through
the
streets

divine
joy
is

that
mingles
in
my
breast
with
so
cruel
a
grief
lord

father

me
i
desire
only
to
love

was
not

hatred
that
is
consuming

was
not
born
to
deceive
to
lie
to
cheat
i
will
go
out
into
the
streets
and
cry
aloud
to
all
the
i
love
i
hate
my
heart
will
relieve
itself
in
this
way
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
be
able
to
reconcile
every
thing
to
love
and
respect
every
one
may
the
most
holy
virgin
protect
me
again
that
terrible
idea
i
don
t
wish
to
think
it
and
i
think
it
ah
i
can
not
deceive
myself
in
regard
to
this
i
can
neither
destroy
it
nor
diminish
it
but
i
can
confess
it
and
i
confess
it
saying
to
thee
lord
i
hate
my
mother
at
last
she
fell
into
a
doze
in
her
uneasy
sleep
her
imagination
reproduced
in
her
mind
all
she
had
done
that
night
distorting
it
without
altering
it
in
substance
she
heard
again
the
clock
of
the
cathedral
striking
nine
she
saw
with
joy
the
old
servant
fall
into
a
peaceful
sleep
and
she
left
the
room
very
slowly
in
order
to
make
no
noise
she
descended
the
stairs
softly
step
by
step
and
on
tiptoe
in
order
to
avoid
making
the
slightest
sound
she
went
into
the
garden
going
around
through
the
servants
quarters
and
the
kitchen
in
the
garden
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
up
at
the
sky
which
was
dark
and
studded
with
stars
the
wind
was
hushed
not
a
breath
disturbed
the
profound
stillness
of
the
night
it
seemed
to
maintain
a
fixed
and
silent
attention
the
attention
of
eyes
that
look
without
winking
and
ears
that
listen
attentively
awaiting
a
great
event
the
night
was
watching
she
then
approached
the
glass
door
of
the
and
looked
cautiously
through
it
from
a
little
distance
fearing
that
those
within
might
perceive
her
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
saw
her
mother
sitting
with
her
back
toward
her
the
penitentiary
was
on
her
right
and
his
profile
seemed
to
undergo
a
strange
transformation
his
nose
grew
larger
and
larger
seeming
like
the
beak
of
some
fabulous
bird
and
his
whole
face
became
a
black
silhouette
with
angles
here
and
there
sharp
derisive
irritating
in
front
of
him
sat
caballuco
who
resembled
a
dragon
rather
than
a
man
rosario
could
see
his
green
eyes
like
two
lanterns
of
convex
glass
this
glow
and
the
imposing
figure
of
the
animal
inspired
her
with
fear
uncle
licurgo
and
the
other
three
men
appeared
to
her
imagination
like
grotesque
little
figures
she
had
seen
somewhere
doubtless
in
some
of
the
clay
figures
at
the
fairs
that
foolish
smile
those
coarse
faces
that
stupid
look
the
dragon
moved
his
arms
which
instead
of
gesticulating
turned
round
like
the
arms
of
a
windmill
and
the
green
globes
like
the
lights
of
a
pharmacy
moved
from
side
to
side
his
glance
was
blinding
the
conversation
appeared
to
be
interesting
the
penitentiary
was
flapping
his
wings
he
was
a
presumptuous
bird
who
tried
to
fly
and
could
not
his
beak
lengthened
itself
twisting
round
and
round
his
feathers
stood
out
as
if
with
rage
and
then
collecting
himself
and
becoming
pacified
he
hid
his
bald
head
under
his
wings
then
the
little
clay
figures
began
to
move
wishing
to
be
persons
and
frasquito
gonzalez
was
trying
to
pass
for
a
man
rosario
felt
an
inexplicable
terror
witnessing
this
friendly
conference
she
went
away
from
the
door
and
advanced
step
by
step
looking
around
her
to
see
if
she
was
observed
although
she
saw
no
one
she
fancied
that
a
million
eyes
were
fastened
upon
her
but
suddenly
her
fears
and
her
shame
were
dispelled
at
the
window
of
the
room
occupied
by
senor
pinzon
appeared
a
man
dressed
in
blue
the
buttons
on
his
coat
shone
like
rows
of
little
lights
she
approached
at
the
same
instant
she
felt
a
pair
of
arms
with
galloons
lift
her
up
as
if
she
were
a
feather
and
with
a
swift
movement
place
her
in
the
room
all
was
changed
suddenly
a
crash
was
heard
a
violent
blow
that
shook
the
house
to
its
foundations
neither
knew
the
cause
of
the
noise
they
trembled
and
were
silent
it
was
the
moment
in
which
the
dragon
had
broken
the
table
in
the
chapter
xxv
unforeseen
events
a
passing
disagreement
the
scene
changes
we
see
before
us
a
handsome
room
bright
modest
gay
comfortable
and
surprisingly
clean
a
fine
matting
covers
the
floor
and
the
white
walls
are
covered
with
good
prints
of
saints
and
some
sculptures
of
doubtful
artistic
value
the
old
mahogany
of
the
furniture
shines
with
the
polish
of
many
saturday
rubbings
and
the
altar
on
which
a
magnificent
virgin
dressed
in
blue
and
silver
receives
domestic
worship
is
covered
with
innumerable
pretty
trifles
half
sacred
half
profane
there
are
on
it
besides
little
pictures
in
beads
fonts
a
with
an
agnes
dei
a
palm
sunday
and
not
a
few
odorless
artificial
flowers
a
number
of
oaken
bookshelves
contain
a
rich
and
choice
library
in
which
horace
the
epicurean
and
sybarite
stands
side
by
side
with
the
tender
virgil
in
whose
verses
we
see
the
heart
of
the
enamored
dido
throbbing
and
melting
ovid
the
as
sublime
as
he
is
obscene
and
sycophantic
side
by

with
martial
the
eloquent
and
witty
vagabond
tibullus
the
impassioned
with
cicero
the
grand
the
severe
titus

with
the
terrible

the
scourge
of
the
caesars
lucretius
the
pantheist
juvenal
who
flayed
with
his
pen

who
composed
the
best
comedies
of
antiquity
while
turning
a
seneca
the
philosopher
of
whom
it
is
said
that
the
noblest
act
of
his
life
was
his
death

the
rhetorician
the
immoral

who
speaks
so
eloquently
of

the
two
plinys

and

in
a
word
all
the
latin
letters
from
the
time
when
they
stammered
their
first
word
with
livius
andronicus
until
they
exhaled
their
last
sigh
with
rutilius
but
while
making
this
unnecessary
though
rapid
enumeration
we
have
not
observed
that
two
women
have
entered
the
room
it
is
very
early
but
the
orbajosans
are
early
risers
the
birds
are
singing
to
burst
their
throats
in
their
cages
the
are
ringing
for
mass
and
the
goats
going
from
house
to
house
to
be
milked
are
tinkling
their
bells
gayly
the
two
ladies
whom
we
see
in
the
room
that
we
have
described
have
just
come
back
from
hearing
mass
they
are
dressed
in
black
and
each
of
them
carries
in
her
right
hand
her
little
and
the
rosary
twined
around
her
fingers
your
uncle
can
not
delay
long
now
said
one
of
them
we
left
him
beginning
mass
but
he
gets
through
quickly
and
by
this
time
he
will
be
in
the
sacristy
taking
off
his
chasuble
i
would
have
stayed
to
hear
him
say
mass
but
is
a
very
busy
day
for
i
heard
only
the
prebendary
s
mass
said
the
other
and
he
says
mass
in
a
twinkling
and
i
don
t
think
it
has
done
me
any
good
for
i
was
greatly
preoccupied
i
could
not
get
the
thought
of
the
terrible
things
that
are
happening
to
us
out
of
my
what
is
to
be
done
we
must
only
have
patience
let
us
see
what
advice
your
uncle
will
give
ah
exclaimed
the
other
heaving
a
deep
and
pathetic
sigh
i
feel
my
blood
on
god
will
protect
to
think
that
a
person
like
you
should
be
threatened
by
a

he
persists
in
his
designs
last
night

went
back
to
the
widow

hotel
as
you
told
me
and
asked
her
for
later
news
don
pepito
and
the
brigadier
batalla
are
always
consulting
together
ah
my
god
consulting
about
their
infernal
plans
and
emptying
bottle
after
bottle
of
wine
they
are
a
pair
of
rakes
a
pair
of
drunkards
no
doubt
they
are
plotting
some
fine
piece
of
villany
together
as
i
take
such
an
interest
in
you
last
night
seeing
don
pepito
having
the
hotel
while
i
was
there
i
followed
him
and
where
did
you
go
to
the
casino
yes
senora
to
the
casino
responded
the
other
with
some
confusion
afterward
he
went
back
to
his
hotel
and
how
my
uncle
scolded
me
because
i
remained
out
so
late
playing
the
spy
in
that
way
but
i
can
t
help
it
and
to
see
a
person
like
you
threatened
by
such
dangers
makes
me
wild
for
there
is
no
use
in
talking
i
foresee
that
the
day
we
least
expect
it
those
villains
will
attack
the
house
and
carry
off

her
eyes
on
the
floor

for
a
long
time
wrapped
in
thought
she
was
pale
and
her
brows
were
gathered
in
a
frown
at
last
she
exclaimed
well
i
see
no
way
of
preventing
it
but

see
a
way

said
the
other
woman
who
was
the
niece
of
the
penitentiary
and
jacinto

mother

a
very
simple
way

explained

you
and
that

do
not
like

are
too
good

occasions
like
this
it
is
better

that
may
be
so
said
the
priest

niece
with
humility
i
wonder
why
god
made
me
so
foolish
that
i
can
understand
nothing
of
those
sublime
ideas
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
the
bottom
to
the
bottom
remedios
don
t
you
understand
yet
my
nephew
is
not
my
nephew
woman
he
is
blasphemy
sacrilege
atheism
demagogy
do
you
know
what
demagogy
is
something
relating
to
those
people
who
burned
paris
with
petroleum
and
those
who
pull
down
the
churches
and
fire
on
the
images
so
far
i
understand
very
well
my
nephew
is
all
that
ah
if
he
were
alone
in
orbajosa
but
no
child
my
nephew
through
a
series
of
fatalities
which
are
trials
the
transitory
evils
that
god
permits
for
our
chastisement
is
equivalent
to
an
army
is
equivalent
to
the
authority
of
the
government
equivalent
to
the
alcalde
equivalent
to
the
judge
my
nephew
is
not
my
nephew
he
is
the
official
nation
remedios
that
second
nation
composed
of
the
scoundrels
who
govern
in
madrid
and
who
have
made
themselves
masters
of
its
material
strength
of
that
apparent
nation
for
the
real
nation
is
the
one
that
is
silent
that
pays
and
suffers
of
that
fictitious
nation
that
signs
decrees
and
pronounces
discourses
and
makes
a
farce
of
government
and
a
farce
of
authority
and
a
farce
of
every
thing
that
is
what
my
nephew
is
you
must
accustom
yourself
to
look
under
the
surface
of
things
my
nephew
is
the
government
the
brigadier
the
new
alcalde
the
new
judge
for
they
all
protect
him
because
of
the
unanimity
of
their
ideas
because
they
are
chips
of
the
same
block
birds
of
a
feather
understand
it
well
we
must
defend
ourselves
against
them
all
for
they
are
all
one
and
one
is
all
we
must
attack
them
all
together
and
not
by
beating
a
man
as
he
turns
a
corner
but
as
our
forefathers
attacked
the
moors
the
moors
remedios
understand
this
well
child
open
your
understanding
and
allow
an
idea
that
is
not
vulgar
to
enter
it
rise
above
yourself
think
lofty
thoughts
remedios
don
inocencio
s
niece
was
struck
dumb
by
so
much
loftiness
of
soul
she
opened
her
mouth
to
say
something
that
should
be
in
consonance
with
so
sublime
an
idea
but
she
only
breathed
a
sigh
like
the
moors
repeated
dona
perfecta
it
is
a
question
of
moors
and
christians
and
did
you
suppose
that
by
giving
a
fright
to
my
nephew
all
would
be
ended
how
foolish
you
are
don
t
you
see
that
his
friends
support
him
don
t
you
see
that
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
that
rabble
don
t
you
see
that
any
little
lieutenant
can
set
fire
to
my
house
if
he
takes
it
into
his
head
to
do
so
but
don

you
know
this
don
t
you
comprehend
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
don
t
you
comprehend
how
vast
how
tremendous
is
the
power
of
my
enemy
who
is
not
a
man
but
a
sect
don
t
you
comprehend
that
my
nephew
as
he
confronts
me
is
not
a
calamity
but
a
plague
against
this
plague
dear
remedios
we
shall
have
here
a
battalion
sent
by
god
that
will
annihilate
the
infernal
militia
from

i
tell
you
that
this
is
going
to
be
great
and
if
it
were
at

so
but
do
you
doubt
it
we
shall
see
terrible
things
here
said
dona

with
great
impatience
what
o
clock
is
it
seven
so
late
and
nothing
has
happened
perhaps
my
uncle
has
heard
something
he
is
here
now
i
hear
him
coming
thank
god
said
dona

rising
to
receive
the
penitentiary
he
will
have
good
news
for

entered
hastily
his
altered
countenance
showed
that
his
soul
consecrated
to
religion
and
to
the
study
of
the
classics
was
not
as
tranquil
as
usual
bad
news
he
said
laying
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
loosening
the
cords
of
his
cloak
dona

turned
pale
they
are
arresting
people
added
don
inocencio
lowering
his
voice
as
if
there
was
a
soldier
hidden
under
every
chair
they
suspect
no
doubt
that
the
people
here
would
not
put
up
with
their
measures
and
they
have
gone
from
house
to
house
arresting
all
who
have
a
reputation
for
dona
perfecta
threw
herself
into
an
easy
chair
and
clutched
its
arms
convulsively
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
they
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
arrested
observed
remedios
many
of
them
have
a
great
many
of
them
said
don

with
an
approving
look
addressing
dona

have
had
time
to
escape
and
have
gone
with
arms
and
horses
to
and
ramos
they
told
me
in
the
cathedral
that
he
is
the
one
they
are
looking
for
most
eagerly
oh
my
god
to
arrest
innocent
people
in
that
way
who
have
done
nothing
yet
well
i
don

know
how
good

can
have
patience
under
such
treatment
senora

when
i
was
telling
you
about
the
arrests
i
forgot
to
say
that
you
ought
to
go
home

will
go
at
once
have
those
bandits
searched
my
house
it
is
possible
senora
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
days
said
don

in
solemn
and
feeling
accents
may
god
have
pity
upon
us
there
are
half
a
dozen
men
in
my
house
responded
the
lady
greatly
agitated
what
iniquity
would
they
be
capable
of
wanting
to
carry
them
off
too
assuredly
senor
pinzon
will
not
have
neglected
to
denounce
them
senora
i
repeat
that
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
days
but
god
will
protect
the
i
am
going
now
don
t
fail
to
stop
in
at
the
senora
as
soon
as
the
lesson
is
over
though
i
imagine
that
with
the
excitement
that
there
is
in
the
town
all
the
boys
will
play
truant
but
in
any
case
i
will
go
to
the
house
after
class
hours
i
don
t
wish
you
to
go
out
alone
senora
those
vagabond
soldiers
are
strutting
about
the
streets
with
such
insolent
airs
jacinto
jacinto
it
is
not
necessary
i
will
go
let
jacinto
go
with
you
said
the
young
man
s
mother
he
must
be
up
by
this
they
heard
the
hurried
footsteps
of
the
little
doctor
who
was
coming
down
the
stairs
in
the
greatest
haste
he
entered
the
room
with
flushed
face
and
panting
for
breath
what
is
the
matter
asked
his
uncle
in
the
troyas
house
said
the
young
man
in
the
house
of
those
those
girls
finish
at
once
caballuco
is
there
up
there
in
the
house
of
the
troyas
yes
senor
he
spoke
to
me
from
the
terrace
and
he
told
me
he
was
afraid
they
were
coming
there
to
arrest
oh
what
a
fool
that
idiot
is
going
to
allow
himself
to
be
arrested
exclaimed
dona
perfecta
tapping
the
floor
impatiently
with
her
foot
he
wants
to
come
down
and
let
us
hide
him
in
the
here
the
canon
and
his
niece
exchanged
a
glance
let
him
come
down
said
dona
perfecta
vehemently
here
repeated
don
inocencio
with
a
look
of
here
answered
the
lady
i
don
t
know
of
any
house
where
he
would
be
more
he
can
let
himself
down
easily
from
the
window
of
my
room
said
jacinto
well
if
it
is
necessary
maria
remedios
said
dona
perfecta
if
they
take
that
man
all
is
i
am
a
fool
and
a
simpleton
answered
the
canon
s
niece
laying
her
hand
on
her
breast
and
stifling
the
sigh
that
was
doubtless
about
to
escape
from
it
but
they
shall
not
take
dona
perfecta
went
out
quickly
and
shortly
afterward
the
centaur
was
making
himself
comfortable
in
the
in
which
don
inocencio
was
accustomed
to
sit
when
he
was
writing
his
sermons
we
do
not
know
how
it
reached
the
ears
of
brigadier
batalla
but
certain
it
is
that
this
active
soldier
had
had
notice
that
the
orbajosans
had
changed
their
intentions
and
on
the
morning
of
this
day
he
had
ordered
the
arrest
of
those
whom
in
our
rich
insurrectional
language
we
are
accustomed
to
call
marked
the
great
caballuco
escaped
by
a
miracle
taking
refuge
in
the
house
of
the
troyas
but
not
thinking
himself
safe
there
he
descended
as
we
have
seen
to
the
holy
and
unsuspected
mansion
of
the
good
canon
at
night
the
soldiers
established
at
various
points
of
the
town
kept
a
strict
watch
on
all
who
came
in
and
went
out
but
ramos
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
cheating
or
perhaps
without
cheating
the
vigilance
of
the
military
this
filled
the
measure
of
the
rage
of
the
orbajosans
and
numbers
of
people
were
conspiring
in
the
hamlets
near
villahorrenda
meeting
at
night
to
disperse
in
the
morning
and
prepare
in
this
way
the
arduous
business
of
the
insurrection
ramos
scoured
the
surrounding
country
collecting
men
and
arms
and
as
the
flying
columns
followed
the
aceros
into
the
district
of
villajuan
de
nahara
our
chivalrous
hero
made
great
progress
in
a
very
short
time
at
night
he
ventured
boldly
into
orbajosa
employing
stratagems
and
perhaps
bribery
his
popularity
and
the
protection
which
he
received
in
the
town
served
him
to
a
certain
extent
as
a
safeguard
and
it
would
not
be
rash
to
affirm
that
the
soldiers
did
not
manifest
toward
this
daring
leader
of
the
insurrection
the
same
rigor
as
toward
the
insignificant
men
of
the
place
in
spain
and
especially
in
time
of
war
which
is
here
always
demoralizing
these
unworthy
considerations
toward
the
great
are
often
seen
while
the
little
are
persecuted
pitilessly
favored
then
by
his
boldness
by
bribery
or
by
we
know
not
what
caballuco
entered
orbajosa
gained
new
recruits
and
collected
arms
and
money
either
for
the
great
security
of
his
person
or
in
order
to
save
appearances
he
did
not
set
foot
in
his
own
house
he
entered
dona
perfecta
s
only
for
the
purpose
of
treating
of
important
affairs
and
he
usually
supped
in
the
house
of
some
friend
preferring
always
the
respected
domicile
of
some
priest
and
especially
that
of
don
inocencio
where
he
had
taken
refuge
on
the
fateful
morning
of
the
arrests
meanwhile
batalla
had
telegraphed
to
the
government
the
information
that
a
plot
of
the
rebels
having
been
discovered
its
authors
had
been
imprisoned
and
the
few
who
had
succeeded
in
escaping
had
fled
in
various
directions
and
were
being
actively
pursued
by
the
military
chapter
xxvi
maria
remedios
there
is
nothing
more
entertaining
than
to
search
for
the
cause
of
some
interesting
event
which
surprises
or
agitates
us
and
nothing
more
satisfactory
than
to
discover
it
when
seeing
violent
passions
in
open
or
concealed
conflict
and
led
by
the
natural
intuitive
impulse
which
always
accompanies
human
observation
we
succeed
in
discovering
the
hidden
source
from
which
that
turbulent
river
had
derived
its
waters
we
experience
a
sensation
very
similar
to
the
delight
of
the
explorer
or
the
discoverer
of
an
unknown
land
this
delight
providence
has
now
bestowed
upon
us
for
exploring
the
hidden
recesses
of
the
hearts
which
beat
in
this
story
we
have
discovered
an
event
that
is
assuredly
the
source
of
the
most
important
events
that
we
have
narrated
a
passion
which
is
the
first
drop
of
water
of
the
impetuous
current
whose
course
we
are
observing
let
us
go
on
with
our
story
then
to
do
so
let
us
leave
senora
de
polentinos
without
concerning
ourselves
in
regard
to
what
may
have
happened
to
her
on
the
morning
of
her
conversation
with
maria
remedios
returning
to
her
house
full
of
anxiety
she
found
herself
obliged
to
endure
the
apologies
and
the
civilities
of
senor
pinzon
who
assured
her
that
while
he
lived
her
house
should
not
be
searched
dona
perfecta
responded
haughtily
without
deigning
to
look
at
him
for
which
reason
he
asked
her
politely
for
an
explanation
of
her
coldness
to
which
she
replied
requesting
senor
pinzon
to
leave
her
house
deferring
to
a
future
occasion
the
explanation
which
she
would
require
from
him
of
his
perfidious
conduct
while
in
it
don
cayetano
arriving
at
this
moment
words
were
exchanged
between
the
two
gentlemen
as
between
man
and
man
but
as
we
are
more
interested
at
present
in
another
matter
we
will
leave
the
polentinos
and
the
to
settle
matters
between
them
as
best
they
can
and
proceed
to
examine
the
question
of
the
sources
above
mentioned
let
us
fix
our
attention
on
maria
remedios
an
estimable
woman
to
whom
it
is
indispensably
necessary
to
devote
a
few
words
she
was
a
lady
a
real
lady
for
notwithstanding
her
humble
origin
the
virtues
of
her
uncle
senor
don
inocencio
also
of
low
origin
but
elevated
by
his
learning
and
his
estimable
qualities
had
shed
extraordinary
lustre
over
the
whole
family
the
love
of
remedios
for
jacinto
was
one
of
the
strongest
passions
of
which
the
maternal
heart
is
capable
she
loved
him
with
delirium
her
son
s
welfare
was
her
first
earthly
consideration
she
regarded
him
as
the
most
perfect
type
of
beauty
and
talent
ever
created
by
god
and
to
see
him
happy
and
great
and
powerful
she
would
have
given
her
whole
life
and
even
a
part
of
the
life
to
come
the
maternal
sentiment
is
the
only
one
which
because
of
its
nobility
and
its
sanctity
will
admit
of
exaggeration
the
only
one
which
the
delirium
of
passion
does
not
debase
nevertheless
it
is
a
singular
phenomenon
frequently
observed
that
this
exaltation
of
maternal
affection
if
not
accompanied
with
absolute
purity
of
heart
and
with
perfect
uprightness
is
apt
to
become
perverted
and
transformed
into
a
lamentable
frenzy
which
may
lead
like
any
other
ungoverned
passion
to
great
errors
and
catastrophies
in
orbajosa
maria
remedios
passed
for
a
model
of
virtue
and
a
model
niece
perhaps
she
was
so
in
reality
she
served
with
affection
all
who
needed
her
services
she
never
gave
occasion
for
gossip
or
for
scandal
she
never
mixed
herself
up
in
intrigues
she
carried
her
religion
to
the
extreme
of
an
offensive
fanaticism
she
practised
charity
she
managed
her
uncle
s
house
with
the
utmost
ability
she
was
well
received
admired
and
kindly
treated
everywhere
in
spite
of
the
almost
intolerable
annoyance
produced
by
her
persistent
habit
of
sighing
and
speaking
always
in
a
complaining
voice
but
in
dona
perfecta
s
house
this
excellent
lady
suffered
a
species
of
in
times
far
distant
and
very
bitter
for
the
family
of
the
good
penitentiary
maria
remedios
since
it
is
the
truth
why
should
it
not
be
told
had
been
a
laundress
in
the
house
of
polentinos
and
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
dona
perfecta
looked
down
upon
her
on
this
account
nothing
of
the
kind
she
behaved
to
her
without
any
haughtiness
she
felt
a
real
sisterly
affection
for
her
they
ate
together
they
prayed
together
they
confided
their
troubles
to
each
other
they
aided
each
other
in
their
charities
and
in
their
devotions
as
well
as
in
domestic
matters
but
truth
to
say
there
was
always
a
something
there
was
always
a
line
invisible
but
which
could
not
be
crossed
between
the
improvised
lady
and
the
lady
by
birth
and
ancestry
dona
perfecta
addressed
maria
as
thou
while
the
latter
could
never
lay
aside
certain
ceremonial
forms
maria
remedios
always
felt
herself
so
insignificant
in
the
presence
of
her
uncle
s
friend
that
her
natural
humility
had
acquired
through
this
feeling
a
strange
tinge
of
sadness
she
saw
that
the
good
canon
was
a
species
of
perpetual
aulic
councillor
in
the
house
she
saw
her
idolized
jacintillo
mingling
on
terms
of
almost
familiarity
with
the
young
lady
and
nevertheless
the
poor
mother
and
niece
visited
the
house
as
little
as
possible
it
is
to
be
observed
that
maria
remedios
dignity
as
a
lady
suffered
not
a
little
in
dona
perfecta
s
house
and
this
was
disagreeable
to
her
for
in
this
sighing
spirit
too
there
was
as
there
is
in
every
living
thing
a
little
pride
to
see
her
son
married
to
rosarito
to
see
him
rich
and
powerful
to
see
him
related
to
dona
perfecta
to
the
senora
ah
this
was
for
maria
remedios
earth
and
heaven
this
life
and
the
next
the
present
and
the
future
the
supreme
totality
of
existence
for
years
her
mind
and
her
heart
had
been
filled
by
the
light
of
this
sweet
hope
because
of
this
hope
she
was
good
and
she
was
bad
because
of
it
she
was
religious
and
humble
or
fierce
and
daring
because
of
it
she
was
whatever
she
was
for
without
this
idea
maria
who
was
the
incarnation
of
her
project
would
not
exist
in
person
maria
remedios
could
not
be
more
insignificant
than
she
was
she
was
remarkable
for
a
surprising
freshness
and
robustness
which
made
her
look
much
younger
than
she
really
was
and
she
always
dressed
in
mourning
although
her
widowhood
was
now
of
long
standing
five
days
had
passed
since
the
entrance
of
caballuco
into
the
penitentiary
s
house
it
was
evening
remedios
entered
her
uncle
s
room
with
the
lighted
lamp
which
she
placed
on
the
table
she
then
seated
herself
in
front
of
the
old
man
who
for
a
great
part
of
the
afternoon
had
been
sitting
motionless
and
thoughtful
in
his
easy
chair
his
fingers
supported
his
chin
wrinkling
up
the
brown
skin
unshaven
for
the
past
three
days
did
caballuco
say
he
would
come
here
to
supper
he
asked
his
niece
yes
senor
he
will
come
it
is
in
a
respectable
house
like
this
that
the
poor
fellow
is
most
well
i
am
not
altogether
easy
in
my
mind
in
spite
of
the
respectability
of
the
house
answered
the
penitentiary
how
the
brave
ramos
exposes
himself
and
i
am
told
that
in
villahorrenda
and
the
surrounding
country
there
are
a
great
many
men
i
don
t
know
how
many
men
what
have
you
heard
that
the
soldiers
are
committing
it
is
a
miracle
that
those
hottentots
have
not
searched
the
house
i
declare
that
if
i
see
one
of
the
gentry
enter
the
house
i
shall
fall
down
this
is
a
nice
condition
of
things
said
remedios
exhaling
half
her
soul
in
a
sigh
i
can
not
get
out
of
my
head
the
idea
of
the
tribulation
in
which
senora
dona
perfecta
finds
herself
uncle
you
ought
to
go
go
there
the
military
are
parading
the
streets
imagine
that
some
insolent
soldier
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
the
senora
is
well
protected
the
other
day
they
searched
the
house
and
they
carried
off
the
six
armed
men
she
had
there
but
afterward
they
sent
them
back
to
her
we
have
no
one
to
protect
us
in
case
of
an
i
sent
jacinto
to
the
senora
s
to
keep
her
company
for
a
while
if
caballuco
comes
we
will
tell
him
to
stop
in
there
too
no
one
can
put
it
out
of
my
head
but
that
those
rascals
are
plotting
some
piece
of
villany
against
our
friend
poor
senora
poor
rosarito
when
one
thinks
that
this
might
have
been
avoided
by
what
i
proposed
to
dona
perfecta
two
days
ago
my
dear
niece
said
the
penitentiary
phlegmatically
we
have
done
all
that
it
was
in
human
power
to
do
to
carry
out
our
virtuous
purpose
more
we
can
not
do
convince
yourself
of
this
and
do
not
be
obstinate
rosarito
can
not
be
the
wife
of
our
idolized
jacintillo
your
golden
dream
your
ideal
of
happiness
that
at
one
time
seemed
attainable
and
to
which
like
a
good
uncle
i
devoted
all
the
powers
of
my
understanding
has
become
chimerical
has
vanished
into
smoke
serious
obstructions
the
wickedness
of
a
man
the
indubitable
love
of
the
girl
and
other
things
regarding
which
i
am
silent
have
altered
altogether
the
condition
of
affairs
we
were
in
a
fair
way
to
conquer
and
suddenly
we
are
conquered
ah
niece
convince
yourself
of
one
thing
as
matters
are
now
jacinto
deserves
something
a
great
deal
better
than
that
crazy
caprices
and
obstinate
notions
responded
maria
with
an
that
was
far
from
respectful
that
s
a
pretty
thing
to
say
now
uncle
the
great
minds
are
outshining
themselves
now
dona
perfecta
with
her
lofty
ideas
and
you
with
your
doubts
and
fears
of
much
use
either
of
you
is
it
is
a
pity
that
god
made
me
such
a
fool
and
gave
me
an
understanding
of
brick
and
mortar
as
the
senora
says
for
if
that
wasn
t
the
case
i
would
soon
settle
the
you
if
she
and
you
had
allowed
me
it
would
be
settled
by
the
beating
there
s
no
occasion
for
you
to
be
frightened
or
to
open
your
eyes
like
that
there
is
no
question
of
killing
any
body
what
an
idea
beating
said
the
canon
smiling
is
like
scratching
when
one
begins
one
doesn
t
know
when
to
leave
bah
say
too
that
i
am
cruel
and
i
wouldn
t
have
the
courage
to
kill
a
fly
it
s
not
very
likely
that
i
should
desire
the
death
of
a
in
fine
child
no
matter
what
objections
you
may
make
senor
don
pepe
rey
will
carry
off
the
girl
it
is
not
possible
now
to
prevent
it
he
is
ready
to
employ
every
means
including
dishonor
if
rosarito
how
she
deceived
us
with
that
demure
little
face
and
those
heavenly
eyes
eh
if
rosarito
i
say
did
not
herself
wish
it
then
all
might
be
arranged
but
alas
she
loves
him
as
the
sinner
loves
satan
she
is
consumed
with
a
criminal
passion
she
has
fallen
niece
into
the
snares
of
the
evil
one
let
us
be
virtuous
and
upright
let
us
turn
our
eyes
away
from
the
ignoble
pair
and
think
no
more
about
either
of
you
know
nothing
about
women
uncle
said
remedios
with
flattering
hypocrisy
you
are
a
holy
man
you
do
not
understand
that
rosario
s
feeling
is
only
a
passing
caprice
one
of
those
caprices
that
are
cured
by
a
sound
niece
said
don
inocencio
gravely
and
sententiously
when
serious
things
have
taken
place
caprices
are
not
called
caprices
but
by
another
uncle
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
responded
maria
remedios
her
face
flushing
suddenly
what
would
you
be
capable
of
supposing
that
rosarito
what
an
atrocity
i
will
defend
her
yes
i
will
defend
her
she
is
as
pure
as
an
angel
why
uncle
those
things
bring
a
blush
to
my
cheek
and
make
me
indignant
with
as
she
spoke
the
good
priest
s
face
was
darkened
by
a
cloud
of
sadness
that
made
him
look
ten
years
older
my
dear
remedios
he
said
we
have
done
all
that
is
humanly
possible
and
all
that
in
conscience
we
can
or
ought
to
do
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
our
desire
to
see
jacintillo
connected
with
that
great
family
the
first
in
orbajosa
nothing
more
natural
than
our
desire
to
see
him
master
of
the
seven
houses
in
the
town
the
meadow
of
mundogrande
the
three
gardens
of
the
upper
farm
la
encomienda
and
the
other
lands
and
houses
which
that
girl
owns
your
son
has
great
merit
every
one
knows
it
well
rosarito
liked
him
and
he
liked
rosarito
the
matter
seemed
settled
dona
perfecta
herself
without
being
very
enthusiastic
doubtless
on
account
of
our
origin
seemed
favorably
disposed
toward
it
because
of
her
great
esteem
and
veneration
for
me
as
her
confessor
and
friend
but
suddenly
this
unlucky
young
man
presents
himself
the
senora
tells
me
that
she
has
given
her
word
to
her
brother
and
that
she
can
not
reject
the
proposal
made
by
him
a
difficult
situation
but
what
do
i
do
in
view
of
all
this
ah
you
don
t
know
every
thing
i
will
be
frank
with
you
if
i
had
found
senor
de
rey
to
be
a
man
of
good
principles
calculated
to
make
rosario
happy
i
would
not
have
interfered
in
the
matter
but
the
young
man
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
wretch
and
as
the
spiritual
director
of
the
house
it
was
my
duty
to
take
a
hand
in
the
business
and
i
took
it
you
know
already
that
i
determined
to
unmask
him
i
exposed
his
vices
i
made
manifest
his
atheism
i
laid
bare
to
the
view
of
all
the
rottenness
of
that
materialistic
heart
and
the
senora
was
convinced
that
in
giving
her
daughter
to
him
she
would
be
delivering
her
up
to
vice
ah
what
anxieties
i
endured
the
senora
vacillated
i
strengthened
her
wavering
mind
i
advised
her
concerning
the
means
she
might
lawfully
employ
to
send
her
nephew
away
without
scandal
i
suggested
ingenious
ideas
to
her
and
as
she
often
spoke
to
me
of
the
scruples
that
troubled
her
tender
conscience
i
tranquillized
her
pointing
out
to
her
how
far
it
was
allowable
for
us
to
go
in
our
fight
against
that
lawless
enemy
never
did
i
counsel
violent
or
sanguinary
measures
or
base
outrages
but
always
subtle
artifices
in
which
there
was
no
sin
my
mind
is
tranquil
my
dear
niece
but
you
know
that
i
struggled
hard
that
i
worked
like
a
negro
ah
when
i
used
to
come
home
every
night
and
say
mariquilla
we
are
getting
on
well
we
are
getting
on
very
well
you
used
to
be
wild
with
delight
and
you
would
kiss
my
hands
again
and
again
and
say
i
was
the
best
man
on
earth
why
do
you
fly
into
a
passion
now
disfiguring
your
noble
character
and
peaceable
disposition
why
do
you
scold
me
why
do
you
say
that
you
are
indignant
and
tell
me
in
plain
terms
that
i
am
nothing
better
than
an
idiot
because
said
the
woman
without
any
diminution
of
her
rage
because
you
have
grown
all
of
a
the
thing
is
that
every
thing
is
going
against
us
woman
that
confounded
engineer
protected
as
he
is
by
the
army
is
resolved
to
dare
every
thing
the
girl
loves
him
the
girl
i
will
say
no
more
it
can
not
be
i
tell
you
that
it
can
not
the
army
but
do
you
believe
like
dona
perfecta
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
war
and
that
to
drive
don
pepe
from
the
town
it
will
be
necessary
for
one
half
of
the
nation
to
rise
up
against
the
other
half
the
senora
has
lost
her
senses
and
you
are
in
a
fair
way
to
lose
i
believe
as
she
does
in
view
of
the
intimate
connection
of
rey
with
the
soldiers
the
personal
question
assumes
larger
proportions
but
ah
niece
if
two
days
ago
i
entertained
the
hope
that
our
valiant
townsmen
would
kick
the
soldiers
out
of
the
town
since
i
have
seen
the
turn
things
have
taken
since
i
have
seen
that
most
of
them
have
been
surprised
before
fighting
and
that
caballuco
is
in
hiding
and
that
the
insurrection
is
going
to
the
devil
i
have
lost
confidence
in
every
thing
the
good
doctrines
have
not
yet
acquired
sufficient
material
force
to
tear
in
pieces
the
ministers
and
the
emissaries
of
error
ah
niece
resignation
resignation
and
don
inocencio
employing
the
method
of
expression
which
characterized
his
niece
heaved
two
or
three
profound
sighs
maria
contrary
to
what
might
have
been
expected
maintained
absolute
silence
she
showed
now
neither
anger
nor
the
superficial
sentimentality
of
her
ordinary
life
but
only
a
profound
and
humble
grief
shortly
after
the
good
canon
had
ended
his
peroration
two
tears
rolled
down
his
niece
s
rosy
cheeks
before
long
were
heard
a
few
sighs
and
gradually
as
the
swell
and
tumult
of
a
sea
that
is
beginning
to
be
stormy
rise
higher
and
higher
and
become
louder
and
louder
so
the
surge
of
maria
remedios
grief
rose
and
swelled
until
it
at
last
broke
forth
in
a
flood
of
tears
chapter
xxvii
a
canon
s
torture
resignation
resignation
repeated
don
inocencio
resignation
resignation
repeated
his
niece
drying
her
tears
if
my
dear
son
is
doomed
to
be
always
a
beggar
well
then
be
it
so
lawsuits
are
becoming
scarce
the
day
will
soon
come
when
the
practice
of
the
law
will
be
the
same
as
nothing
what
is
the
use
of
all
his
talent
what
is
the
use
of
his
tiring
his
brain
with
so
much
study
ah
we
are
poor
a
day
will
come
senor
don
inocencio
when
my
poor
boy
will
not
have
a
pillow
on
which
to
lay
his
woman
man
can
you
deny
it
tell
me
then
what
inheritance
are
you
going
to
leave
him
when
you
close
your
eyes
on
this
world
a
couple
of
rooms
half
a
dozen
big
books
poverty
and
nothing
more
what
times
are
before
us
uncle
what
times
my
poor
boy
is
growing
very
delicate
in
his
health
and
he
won
t
be
able
to
work
it
makes
him
dizzy
now
to
read
a
book
he
gets
a
headache
and
nausea
whenever
he
works
at
night
he
will
have
to
beg
a
paltry
situation
i
shall
have
to
take
in
sewing
and
who
knows
who
knows
but
we
may
have
to
beg
our
bread
woman
oh
i
know
very
well
what
i
am
talking
about
fine
times
before
us
added
the
excellent
woman
forcing
still
more
the
lachrymose
note
in
her
diatribe
my
god
what
is
going
to
become
of
us
ah
it
is
only
a
mother
s
heart
that
can
feel
these
things
only
a
mother
is
capable
of
suffering
so
much
anxiety
about
a
son
s
welfare
how
should
you
understand
it
no
it
is
one
thing
to
have
children
and
to
suffer
anxiety
on
their
account
and
another
to
sing
the
in
the
cathedral
and
to
teach
latin
in
the
institute
of
great
use
is
it
for
my
son
to
be
your
nephew
and
to
have
taken
so
many
honors
and
to
be
the
pride
and
ornament
of
orbajosa
he
will
die
of
starvation
for
we
already
know
what
law
brings
or
else
he
will
have
to
ask
the
deputies
for
a
situation
in
havana
where
the
yellow
fever
will
kill
but
niece
no
i
am
not
grieving
i
am
silent
now
i
won
t
annoy
you
any
more
i
am
very
troublesome
always
crying
and
sighing
and
i
am
not
to
be
endured
because
i
am
a
fond
mother
and
i
will
look
out
for
the
good
of
my
beloved
son
i
will
die
yes
i
will
die
in
silence
and
stifle
my
grief
i
will
swallow
my
tears
in
order
not
to
annoy
his
reverence
the
canon
but
my
idolized
son
will
comprehend
me
and
he
won
t
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
as
you
are
doing
now
woe
is
me
poor
jacinto
knows
that
i
would
die
for
him
and
that
i
would
purchase
his
happiness
at
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
darling
child
of
my
soul
to
be
so
deserving
and
to
be
forever
doomed
to
mediocrity
to
a
humble
station
for
don
t
get
indignant
uncle
no
matter
what
airs
we
put
on
you
will
always
be
the
son
of
uncle
tinieblas
the
sacristan
of
san
bernardo
and
i
shall
never
be
any
thing
more
than
the
daughter
of
ildefonso
tinieblas
your
brother
who
used
to
sell
crockery
and
my
son
will
be
the
grandson
of
the
tinieblas
for
obscure
we
were
born
and
we
shall
never
emerge
from
our
obscurity
nor
own
a
piece
of
land
of
which
we
can
say
this
is
mine
nor
shall
i
ever
plunge
my
arms
up
to
the
elbows
in
a
sack
of
wheat
threshed
and
winnowed
on
our
own
all
because
of
your
cowardice
your
folly
your
but
but
niece
the
canon
s
voice
rose
higher
every
time
he
repeated
this
phrase
and
with
his
hands
to
his
ears
he
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
a
look
of
mingled
grief
and
desperation
the
shrill
complaint
of
maria
remedios
grew
constantly
shriller
and
pierced
the
brain
of
the
unhappy
and
now
dazed
priest
like
an
arrow
but
all
at
once
the
woman
s
face
became
transformed
her
plaintive
wail
was
changed
to
a
hard
shrill
scream
she
turned
pale
her
lips
trembled
she
clenched
her
hands
a
few
locks
of
her
disordered
hair
fell
over
her
forehead
her
eyes
glittered
dried
by
the
heat
of
the
anger
that
glowed
in
her
breast
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
not
like
a
woman
but
like
a
harpy
cried
i
am
going
away
from
here
i
am
going
away
from
here
with
my
son
we
will
go
to
madrid
i
don
t
want
my
son
to
fret
himself
to
death
in
this
miserable
town
i
am
tired
now
of
seeing
that
my
son
under
the
protection
of
the
cassock
neither
is
nor
ever
will
be
any
thing
do
you
hear
my
reverend
uncle
my
son
and
i
are
going
away
you
will
never
see
us
again
never
don
inocencio
had
clasped
his
hands
and
was
receiving
the
thunderbolts
of
his
niece
s
wrath
with
the
consternation
of
a
criminal
whom
the
presence
of
the
executioner
has
deprived
of
his
last
hope
in
heaven
s
name
remedios
he
murmured
in
a
pained
voice
in
the
name
of
the
holy
virgin
these
fits
of
range
of
his
niece
who
was
usually
so
meek
were
as
violent
as
they
were
rare
and
five
or
six
years
would
sometimes
pass
without
don
inocencio
seeing
remedios
transformed
into
a
fury
i
am
a
mother
i
am
a
mother
and
since
no
one
else
will
look
out
for
my
son
i
will
look
out
for
him
myself
roared
the
improvised
lioness
in
the
name
of
the
virgin
niece
don
t
let
your
passion
get
the
best
of
you
remember
that
you
are
committing
a
sin
let
us
say
the
lord
s
prayer
and
an
ave
maria
and
you
will
see
that
this
will
pass
as
he
said
this
the
penitentiary
trembled
and
the
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
poor
dove
in
the
talons
of
the
vulture
the
furious
woman
completed
his
discomfiture
with
these
words
you
are
good
for
nothing
you
are
a
poltroon
my
son
and
i
will
go
away
from
this
place
forever
forever
i
will
get
a
position
for
my
son
i
will
find
him
a
good
position
do
you
understand
just
as
i
would
be
willing
to
sweep
the
streets
with
my
tongue
if
i
could
gain
a
living
for
him
in
no
other
way
so
i
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
find
a
position
for
my
boy
in
order
that
he
may
rise
in
the
world
and
be
rich
and
a
person
of
consequence
and
a
gentleman
and
a
lord
and
great
and
all
that
there
is
to
be
all
all
heaven
protect
me
cried
don
inocencio
sinking
into
a
chair
and
letting
his
head
fall
on
his
breast
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
agitated
breathing
of
the
furious
woman
could
be
heard
niece
said
don
inocencio
at
last
you
have
shortened
my
life
by
ten
years
you
have
set
my
blood
on
fire
you
have
put
me
beside
myself
god
give
me
the
calmness
that
i
need
to
bear
with
you
lord
patience
patience
is
what
i
ask
and
you
niece
do
me
the
favor
to
sigh
and
cry
to
your
heart
s
content
for
the
next
ten
years
for
your
confounded
mania
of
sniveling
greatly
as
it
annoys
me
is
preferable
to
these
mad
fits
of
rage
if
i
did
not
know
that
you
are
good
at
heart
well
for
one
who
confessed
and
received
communion
this
morning
you
are
behaving
yes
but
you
are
the
cause
of
it
you
because
in
the
matter
of
rosario
and
jacinto
i
say
to
you
resignation
because
when
every
thing
is
going
on
well
you
turn
back
and
allow
senor
de
rey
to
get
possession
of
and
how
am
i
going
to
prevent
it
dona
perfecta
is
right
in
saying
that
you
have
an
understanding
of
brick
do
you
want
me
to
go
about
the
town
with
a
sword
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
to
make
mincemeat
of
the
whole
regiment
and
then
confront
rey
and
say
to
him
leave
the
girl
in
peace
or
i
will
cut
your
throat
no
but
when
i
advised
the
senora
to
give
her
nephew
a
fright
you
opposed
my
advice
instead
of
supporting
you
are
crazy
with
your
talk
about
a
because
when
the
dog
is
dead
the
madness
is
at
an
i
can
not
advise
what
you
call
a
fright
and
what
might
be
a
terrible
yes
because
i
am
a
am
i
not
uncle
you
know
that
practical
jokes
are
vulgar
besides
do
you
suppose
that
man
would
allow
himself
to
be
insulted
and
his
friends
at
night
he
goes
out
how
do
you
know
that
i
know
every
thing
he
does
not
take
a
step
that
i
am
not
aware
of
do
you
understand
the
widow
de
cuzco
keeps
me
informed
of
every
there
don
t
set
me
crazy
and
who
is
going
to
give
him
that
fright
let
us
so
that
he
is
disposed
no
but
he
will
be
if
you
command
come
niece
leave
me
in
peace
i
can
not
command
such
an
atrocity
a
fright
and
what
is
that
have
you
spoken
to
him
already
yes
senor
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
or
rather
he
refused
there
are
only
two
people
in
orbajosa
who
can
make
him
do
what
they
wish
by
a
simple
order
you
and
dona
let
dona
perfecta
order
him
to
do
it
if
she
wishes
then
i
will
never
advise
the
employment
of
violent
and
brutal
measures
will
you
believe
that
when
caballuco
and
some
of
his
followers
were
talking
of
rising
up
in
arms
they
could
not
draw
a
single
word
from
me
inciting
them
to
bloodshed
no
not
that
if
dona
perfecta
wishes
to
do
it
she
will
not
do
it
either
i
talked
with
her
for
two
hours
this
afternoon
and
she
said
that
she
would
preach
war
and
help
it
by
every
means
in
her
power
but
that
she
would
not
bid
one
man
stab
another
in
the
back
she
would
be
right
in
opposing
it
if
anything
serious
were
intended
but
i
don
t
want
any
wounds
all
i
want
is
to
give
him
a
well
if
dona
perfecta
doesn
t
want
to
order
a
fright
to
be
given
to
the
engineer
i
don
t
either
do
you
understand
my
conscience
is
before
every
very
well
returned
his
niece
tell
caballuco
to
come
with
me
that
is
all
you
need
say
to
are
you
going
out
yes
senor
i
am
going
out
why
didn
t
i
go
out
last
night
too
last
night
i
didn
t
know
it
if
i
had
known
it
i
should
have
been
angry
yes
all
you
have
to
say
to
caballuco
is
this
my
dear
ramos
i
will
be
greatly
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
accompany
my
niece
on
an
errand
which
she
has
to
do
and
if
you
will
protect
her
if
she
should
chance
to
be
in
any
i
can
do
that
to
accompany
you
to
protect
you
ah
rogue
you
want
to
deceive
me
and
make
me
your
accomplice
in
some
piece
of
of
course
what
do
you
suppose
said
maria
remedios
ironically
between
ramos
and
me
we
are
going
to
slaughter
a
great
many
people
don
t
jest
i
tell
you
again
that
i
will
not
advise
ramos
to
do
any
thing
that
has
the
appearance
of
evil
i
think
he
is
a
noise
at
the
was
heard
then
the
voice
of
caballuco
speaking
to
the
servant
and
a
little
later
the
hero
of
orbajosa
entered
the
room
what
is
the
news
give
us
the
news
senor
ramos
said
the
priest
come
if
you
don
t
give
us
some
hope
in
exchange
for
your
supper
and
our
hospitality
what
is
going
on
in
villahorrenda
something
answered
the
bravo
seating
himself
with
signs
of
fatigue
you
shall
soon
see
whether
we
are
good
for
anything
or
like
all
persons
who
wish
to
make
themselves
appear
important
caballuco
made
a
show
of
great
reserve
my
friend
you
shall
take
with
you
if
you
wish
the
money
they
have
given
me
for
there
is
good
need
of
it
if
the
soldiers
should
get
scent
of
it
however
they
won
t
let
me
pass
said
ramos
with
a
brutal
laugh
hold
your
tongue
man
we
know
already
that
you
pass
whenever
you
please
why
that
would
be
a
pretty
thing
the
soldiers
are
not
gentry
and
if
they
should
become
troublesome
with
a
couple
of
dollars
eh
come
i
see
that
you
are
not
badly
armed
all
you
want
now
is
an
pistols
eh
and
a
dagger
for
any
thing
that
might
happen
said
caballuco
taking
the
weapon
from
his
belt
and
displaying
its
horrible
blade
in
the
name
of
god
and
of
the
virgin
exclaimed
maria
remedios
closing
her
eyes
and
turning
her
face
in
terror
put
away
that
thing
the
very
sight
of
it
terrifies
if
you
won
t
take
it
ill
of
me
said
ramos
shutting
the
weapon
let
us
have
maria
remedios
prepared
every
thing
quickly
in
order
that
the
hero
might
not
become
impatient
listen
to
me
a
moment
senor
ramos
said
don
inocencio
to
his
guest
when
they
had
sat
down
to
supper
have
you
a
great
deal
to
do
something
there
is
to
be
done
responded
the
bravo
this
is
the
last
night
i
shall
come
to
orbajosa
the
last
i
have
to
look
up
some
boys
who
remained
in
the
town
and
we
are
going
to
see
how
we
can
get
possession
of
the
saltpetre
and
the
sulphur
that
are
in
the
house
of
i
asked
you
said
the
curate
amiably
filling
his
friend
s
plate
because
my
niece
wishes
you
to
accompany
her
a
short
distance
she
has
some
business
or
other
to
attend
to
and
it
is
a
little
late
to
be
out
is
she
going
to
dona
perfecta
s
asked
ramos
i
was
there
a
few
moments
ago
but
i
did
not
want
to
make
any
how
is
the
senora
a
little
frightened
i
took
away
the
six
young
men
i
had
in
the
why
don
t
you
think
they
will
be
wanted
there
said
remedios
with
alarm
they
are
wanted
more
in
villahorrenda
brave
men
chafe
at
being
kept
in
the
house
is
it
not
so
senor
canon
senor
ramos
that
house
ought
not
to
be
left
unprotected
said
the
penitentiary
the
servants
are
enough
and
more
than
enough
but
do
you
suppose
senor
don
inocencio
that
the
brigadier
employs
himself
in
attacking
the
people
s
houses
yes
but
you
know
very
well
that
that
diabolical
engineer
for
that
there
are
not
wanting
brooms
in
the
house
said
cristobal
jovially
for
in
the
end
there
will
be
no
help
for
it
but
to
marry
them
after
what
has
passed
senor
ramos
said
remedios
with
sudden
anger
i
imagine
that
all
you
know
about
marrying
people
is
very
i
say
that
because
a
little
while
ago
when
i
was
at
the
house
the
mother
and
daughter
seemed
to
be
having
a
sort
of
reconciliation
dona
perfecta
was
kissing
rosarito
over
and
over
again
and
there
was
no
end
to
their
caresses
and
reconciliation
with
all
these
preparations
for
the
war
you
have
lost
your
senses
but
finally
are
you
coming
with
me
or
not
it
is
not
to
dona
perfecta
s
she
wants
to
go
said
the
priest
but
to
the
hotel
of
the
widow
de
cuzco
she
was
saying
that
she
does
not
dare
to
go
alone
because
she
is
afraid
of
being
by
whom
it
is
easily
understood
by
that
infernal
engineer
last
night
my
niece
met
him
there
and
she
gave
him
some
plain
talk
and
for
that
reason
she
is
not
altogether
easy
in
her
mind
the
young
fellow
is
revengeful
and
i
don
t
know
whether
i
can
go
said
caballuco
as
i
am
in
hiding
now
i
can
not
measure
my
strength
against
don
jose
poquita
cosa
if
i
were
not
as
i
am
with
half
my
face
hidden
and
the
other
half
uncovered
i
would
have
broken
his
back
for
him
already
twenty
times
over
but
what
happens
if
i
attack
him
he
discovers
who
i
am
he
falls
upon
me
with
the
soldiers
and
to
caballuco
as
for
giving
him
a
treacherous
blow
that
is
something
i
couldn
t
do
nor
would
dona
perfecta
consent
to
it
either
for
a
stab
in
the
dark
cristobal
ramos
is
not
the
but
are
you
crazy
man
what
are
you
thinking
about
said
the
penitentiary
with
unmistakable
signs
of
astonishment
not
even
in
thought
would
i
advise
you
to
do
an
injury
to
that
gentleman
i
would
cut
my
tongue
out
before
i
would
advise
such
a
piece
of
villany
the
wicked
will
fall
it
is
true
but
it
is
god
who
will
fix
the
moment
not
i
and
the
question
is
not
to
give
a
beating
either
i
would
rather
receive
a
hundred
blows
myself
than
advise
the
administration
of
such
a
medicine
to
any
christian
one
thing
only
will
i
say
to
you
he
ended
looking
at
the
bravo
over
his
spectacles
and
that
is
that
as
my
niece
is
going
there
and
as
it
is
probable
very
probable
is
it
not
remedios
that
she
may
have
to
say
a
few
plain
words
to
that
man
i
recommend
you
not
to
leave
her
unprotected
in
case
she
should
be
i
have
something
to
do
answered
caballuco
laconically
and
dryly
you
hear
what
he
says
remedios
leave
your
business
for
i
can
t
do
that
i
will
go
no
you
shall
not
go
alone
niece
now
let
us
hear
no
more
about
the
matter
senor
ramos
has
something
to
do
and
he
can
not
accompany
you
fancy
if
you
were
to
be
insulted
by
that
rude
man
insulted
a
lady
insulted
by
that
fellow
exclaimed
caballuco
come
that
must
not
if
you
had
not
something
to
do
bah
i
should
be
quite
easy
in
my
mind
i
have
something
to
do
said
the
centaur
rising
from
the
table
but
if
you
wish
it
there
was
a
pause
the
penitentiary
had
closed
his
eyes
and
was
meditating
i
wish
it
senor
ramos
he
said
at
last
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
then
let
us
go
senora
dona
now
my
dear
niece
said
don
inocencio
half
seriously
half
jestingly
since
we
have
finished
supper
bring
me
the
he
gave
his
niece
a
penetrating
glance
and
accompanying
it
with
the
corresponding
action
pronounced
these
words
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
chapter
xxviii
from
pepe
rey
to
don
juan
rey
orbajosa
april
my
dear
father
forgive
me
if
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
disobey
you
in
refusing
to
leave
this
place
or
to
renounce
my
project
your
advice
and
your
entreaty
are
what
were
to
be
expected
from
a
kind
good
father
my
obstinacy
is
natural
in
an
insensate
son
but
something
strange
is
taking
place
within
me
obstinacy
and
honor
have
become
so
blended
and
confounded
in
my
mind
that
the
bare
idea
of
desisting
from
my
purpose
makes
me
ashamed
i
have
changed
greatly
the
fits
of
rage
that
agitate
me
now
were
formerly
unknown
to
me
i
regarded
the
violent
acts
the
exaggerated
expressions
of
and
impetuous
men
with
the
same
scorn
as
the
brutal
actions
of
the
wicked
nothing
of
this
kind
surprises
me
any
longer
for
in
myself
i
find
at
all
times
a
certain
terrible
capacity
for
wickedness
i
can
speak
to
you
as
i
would
speak
to
god
and
to
my
conscience
i
can
tell
you
that
i
am
a
wretch
for
he
is
a
wretch
who
is
wanting
in
that
powerful
moral
force
which
enables
him
to
chastise
his
passions
and
submit
his
life
to
the
stern
rule
of
conscience
i
have
been
wanting
in
the
christian
fortitude
which
exalts
the
spirit
of
the
man
who
is
offended
above
the
offences
which
he
receives
and
the
enemies
from
whom
he
receives
them
i
have
had
the
weakness
to
abandon
myself
to
a
mad
fury
putting
myself
on
a
level
with
my
detractors
returning
them
blow
for
blow
and
endeavoring
to
confound
them
by
methods
learned
in
their
own
base
school
how
deeply
i
regret
that
you
were
not
at
my
side
to
turn
me
from
this
path
it
is
now
too
late
the
passions
will
not
brook
delay
they
are
impatient
and
demand
their
prey
with
cries
and
with
the
convulsive
eagerness
of
a
fierce
moral
thirst
i
have
succumbed
i
can
not
forget
what
you
so
often
said
to
me
that
anger
may
be
called
the
worst
of
the
passions
since
suddenly
transforming
the
character
it
engenders
all
the
others
and
lends
to
each
its
own
infernal
fire
but
it
is
not
anger
alone
that
has
brought
me
to
the
state
of
mind
which
i
have
described
a
more
expansive
and
noble
sentiment
the
profound
and
ardent
love
which
i
have
for
my
cousin
has
also
contributed
to
it
and
this
is
the
one
thing
that
absolves
me
in
my
own
estimation
but
if
love
had
not
done
so
pity
would
have
impelled
me
to
brave
the
fury
and
the
intrigues
of
your
terrible
sister
for
poor
rosario
placed
between
an
irresistible
affection
and
her
mother
is
at
the
present
moment
one
of
the
most
unhappy
beings
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
love
which
she
has
for
me
and
which
responds
to
mine
does
it
not
give
me
the
right
to
open
in
whatever
way
i
can
the
doors
of
her
house
and
take
her
out
of
it
employing
the
law
as
far
as
the
law
reaches
and
using
force
at
the
point
where
the
law
ceases
to
support
me
i
think
that
your
rigid
moral
scrupulosity
will
not
give
an
affirmative
answer
to
this
question
but
i
have
ceased
to
be
the
upright
and
methodical
character
whose
conscience
was
in
exact
conformity
with
the
dictates
of
the
moral
law
i
am
no
longer
the
man
whom
an
almost
perfect
education
enabled
to
keep
his
emotions
under
strict
control
i
am
a
man
like
other
men
at
a
single
step
i
have
crossed
the
line
which
separates
the
just
and
the
good
from
the
unjust
and
the
wicked
prepare
yourself
to
hear
of
some
dreadful
act
committed
by
me
i
will
take
care
to
notify
you
of
all
my
misdeeds
but
the
confession
of
my
faults
will
not
relieve
me
from
the
responsibility
of
the
serious
occurrences
which
have
taken
place
and
which
are
taking
place
nor
will
this
responsibility
no
matter
how
much
i
may
argue
fall
altogether
on
your
sister
dona
perfecta
s
responsibility
is
certainly
very
great
what
will
be
the
extent
of
mine
ah
dear
father
believe
nothing
of
what
you
hear
about
me
believe
only
what
i
shall
tell
you
if
they
tell
you
that
i
have
committed
a
deliberate
piece
of
villany
answer
that
it
is
a
lie
it
is
difficult
very
difficult
for
me
to
judge
myself
in
the
state
of
disquietude
in
which
i
am
but
i
dare
assure
you
that
i
have
not
deliberately
given
cause
for
scandal
you
know
well
to
what
extremes
passion
can
lead
when
circumstances
favor
its
fierce
its
growth
what
is
most
bitter
to
me
is
the
thought
of
having
employed
artifice
deceit
and
base
concealments
i
who
was
truth
itself
i
am
humiliated
in
my
own
estimation
but
is
this
the
greatest
perversity
into
which
the
soul
can
fall
am
i
beginning
now
or
have
i
ended
i
can
not
tell
if
rosario
with
her
angelic
hand
does
not
take
me
out
of
this
hell
of
my
conscience
i
desire
that
you
should
come
to
take
me
out
of
it
my
cousin
is
an
angel
and
suffering
as
she
has
done
for
my
sake
she
has
taught
me
a
great
many
things
that
i
did
not
know
before
do
not
be
surprised
at
the
incoherence
of
what
i
write
diverse
emotions
inflame
me
thoughts
at
times
assail
me
truly
worthy
of
my
immortal
soul
but
at
times
also
i
fall
into
a
lamentable
state
of
dejection
and
i
am
reminded
of
the
weak
and
degenerate
characters
whose
baseness
you
have
painted
to
me
in
such
strong
colors
in
order
that
i
might
abhor
them
in
the
state
in
which
i
am
i
am
ready
for
good
or
for
evil
god
have
pity
upon
me
i
already
know
what
prayer
is
a
solemn
and
reflexive
supplication
so
personal
that
it
is
not
compatible
with
formulas
learned
by
heart
an
expansion
of
the
soul
which
dares
to
reach
out
toward
its
source
the
opposite
of
remorse
in
which
the
soul
at
war
with
itself
seeks
in
vain
to
defend
itself
by
sophisms
and
concealments
you
have
taught
me
many
good
things
but
now
i
am
practising
as
we
engineers
say
i
am
studying
on
the
ground
and
in
this
way
my
knowledge
will
become
broadened
and
confirmed
i
begin
to
imagine
now
that
i
am
not
so
wicked
as
i
myself
believe
am
i
right
i
end
this
letter
in
haste
i
must
send
it
with
some
soldiers
who
are
going
in
the
direction
of
the
station
at
villahorrenda
for
the
of
this
place
is
not
to
be
april
it
would
amuse
you
dear
father
if
i
could
make
you
understand
the
ideas
of
the
people
of
this
wretched
town
you
know
already
that
almost
all
the
country
is
up
in
arms
it
was
a
thing
to
be
anticipated
and
the
politicians
are
mistaken
if
they
imagine
that
it
will
be
over
in
a
couple
of
days
hostility
to
us
and
to
the
government
is
innate
in
the
orbajosan
s
mind
and
forms
a
part
of
it
as
much
as
his
religious
faith
confining
myself
to
the
particular
question
with
my
aunt
i
will
tell
you
a
singular
thing
the
poor
lady
who
is
penetrated
by
the
spirit
of
feudalism
to
the
marrow
of
her
bones
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
i
am
going
to
attack
her
house
and
carry
off
her
daughter
as
the
gentlemen
of
the
middle
ages
attacked
an
enemy
s
castle
to
consummate
some
outrage
don
t
laugh
for
it
is
the
truth
such
are
the
ideas
of
these
people
i
need
not
tell
you
that
she
regards
me
as
a
monster
as
a
sort
of
heretic
moorish
king
and
of
the
officers
here
who
are
my
friends
she
has
no
better
opinion
in
dona
perfecta
s
house
it
is
a
matter
of
firm
belief
that
the
army
and
i
have
formed
a
diabolical
and
coalition
to
rob
orbajosa
of
its
treasures
its
faith
and
its
maidens
i
am
sure
that
your
sister
firmly
believes
that
i
am
going
to
take
her
house
by
assault
and
there
is
not
a
doubt
but
that
behind
the
door
some
barricade
has
been
erected
but
it
could
not
be
otherwise
here
they
have
the
most
antiquated
ideas
respecting
society
religion
the
state
property
the
religious
exaltation
which
impels
them
to
employ
force
against
the
government
to
defend
a
faith
which
no
one
has
attacked
and
which
besides
they
do
not
possess
revives
in
their
mind
the
feudal
sentiment
and
as
they
would
settle
every
question
by
brute
force
with
the
sword
and
with
fire
killing
all
who
do
not
think
as
they
do
they
believe
that
no
one
in
the
world
employs
other
methods
far
from
intending
to
perform
quixotic
deeds
in
this
lady
s
house
i
have
in
reality
saved
her
some
annoyances
from
which
the
rest
of
the
town
have
not
escaped
owing
to
my
friendship
with
the
brigadier
she
has
not
been
obliged
to
present
as
was
ordered
a
list
of
those
of
the
men
in
her
service
who
have
joined
the
insurgents
and
if
her
house
was
searched
i
have
certain
knowledge
that
it
was
only
for
form
s
sake
and
if
the
six
men
there
were
disarmed
they
have
been
replaced
by
six
others
and
nothing
has
been
done
to
her
you
see
to
what
my
hostility
to
that
lady
is
reduced
it
is
true
that
i
have
the
support
of
the
military
chiefs
but
i
make
use
of
it
solely
to
escape
being
insulted
or
by
these
implacable
people
the
probabilities
of
my
success
consist
in
the
fact
that
the
authorities
recently
appointed
by
the
commander
of
the
brigade
are
all
my
friends
i
derive
from
them
the
moral
force
which
enables
me
to
intimidate
these
people
i
don
t
know
whether
i
shall
find
myself
compelled
to
commit
some
violent
action
but
don
t
be
alarmed
for
the
assault
and
the
taking
of
the
house
is
altogether
a
wild
feudal
idea
of
your
sister
chance
has
placed
me
in
an
advantageous
position
rage
the
passion
that
burns
within
me
will
impel
me
to
profit
by
it
i
don
t
know
how
far
i
may
april
your
letter
has
given
me
great
consolation
yes
i
can
attain
my
object
employing
only
the
resources
of
the
law
which
will
be
completely
effectual
for
it
i
have
consulted
the
authorities
of
this
place
and
they
all
approve
of
the
course
you
indicate
i
am
very
glad
of
it
since
i
have
put
into
my
cousin
s
mind
the
idea
of
disobedience
let
it
at
least
be
under
the
protection
of
the
law
i
will
do
what
you
bid
me
that
is
to
say
i
will
renounce
the
somewhat
unworthy
collaboration
of
pinzon
i
will
break
up
the
terrorizing
solidarity
which
i
established
with
the
soldiers
i
will
cease
to
make
a
display
of
the
power
i
derived
from
them
i
will
have
done
with
adventures
and
at
the
fitting
moment
i
will
act
with
calmness
prudence
and
all
the
benignity
possible
it
is
better
so
my
coalition
with
the
army
had
for
its
object
to
protect
me
against
the
violence
of
the
orbajosans
and
of
the
servants
and
the
relations
of
my
aunt
for
the
rest
i
have
always
disapproved
of
the
idea
of
what
we
call
armed
intervention
the
friend
who
aided
me
has
been
obliged
to
leave
the
house
but
i
am
not
entirely
cut
off
from
communication
with
my
cousin
the
poor
girl
shows
heroic
valor
in
the
midst
of
her
sufferings
and
will
obey
me
blindly
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
my
personal
safety
for
my
part
i
have
no
fear
and
i
am
quite
april
i
can
write
only
a
few
lines
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
all
will
be
ended
within
two
or
three
days
don
t
write
to
me
again
to
this
miserable

i
shall
soon
have
the
happiness
of

a

tell
you
what
course
i
have
decided
upon
and
what
you
are
to

that

only
a
minute
then
dona

after

walked
on
about
thirty
paces
keeping
at

moderate
distance
behind

quickening
his
steps
but
they
were
mistaken

the

dark
and
the

could
not
tell
precisely
at
what
point
senor
de

had
entered
but
a
grating
of
rusty
hinges
which
they
heard
and
the
circumstance
of
not
meeting
the
young
man
in
the
whole
length
of
the
garden
wall
convinced
them
that
he
had
entered
the
garden
caballuco
looked
at
his
companion
with
stupefaction
he
seemed
bewildered
what
are
you
thinking
about
do
you
still
doubt
what
ought
i
to
do
asked
the
bravo
covered
with
confusion
shall
we
give
him
a
fright
i
don
t
know
what
the
senora
would
think
about
it
i
say
that
because
i
was
at
her
house
this
evening
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
mother
and

become

t
be
a
fool
why
don
t
you

remember
that

told
them
to

go
in
if

over
the
wall
what
a
snail
if
i
were

then
up
there

some
broken
bricks
here
where
the

climb
over

to
steal

and
knock

not
without
difficulty
he
sat
astride
on
the
wall
for
an
instant
and
then
disappeared
among
the
dark
foliage
of
the
trees

desperately
toward

calle

seizing

knocker
of

dona
perfecta
see
with
what
tranquillity
senora
dona
perfecta
pursues
her
occupation
of
writing
enter
her
room
and
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
you
will
surprise
her
busily
engaged
her
mind
divided
between
meditation
and
the
writing
of
several
long
and
carefully
worded
epistles
traced
with
a
firm
hand
every
of
every
letter
in
which
is
correctly
formed
the
light
of
the
lamp
falls
full
upon
her
face
and
bust
and
hands
its
shade
leaving
the
rest
of
her
person
and
almost
the
whole
of
the
room
in
a
soft
shadow
she
seems
like
a
luminous
figure
evoked
by
the
imagination
from
amid
the
vague
shadows
of
fear
it
is
strange
that
we
should
not
have
made
before
this
a
very
important
statement
which
is
that
dona
perfecta
was
handsome
or
rather
that
she
was
still
handsome
her
face
preserving
the
remains
of
former
beauty
the
life
of
the
country
her
total
lack
of
vanity
her
disregard
for
dress
and
personal
adornment
her
hatred
of
fashion
her
contempt
for
the
vanities
of
the
capital
were
all
causes
why
her
native
beauty
did
not
shine
or
shone
very
little
the
intense
shallowness
of
her
complexion
indicating
a
very
bilious
constitution
still
further
impaired
her
beauty
her
eyes
black
and
her
nose
finely
and
delicately
shaped
her
forehead
broad
and
smooth
she
was
considered
by
all
who
saw
her
as
a
finished
type
of
the
human
figure
but
there
rested
on
those
features
a
certain
hard
and
proud
expression
which
excited
a
feeling
of
antipathy
as
some
persons
although
ugly
attract
dona
perfecta
repelled
her
glance
even
when
accompanied
by
amiable
words
placed
between
herself
and
those
who
were
strangers
to
her
the
impassable
distance
of
a
mistrustful
respect
but
for
those
of
her
house
that
is
to
say
for
her
relations
admirers
and
allies
she
possessed
a
singular
attraction
she
was
a
mistress
in
governing
and
no
one
could
equal
her
in
the
art
of
adapting
her
language
to
the
person
whom
she
was
addressing
her
bilious
temperament
and
an
excessive
association
with
devout
persons
and
things
which
excited
her
imagination
without
object
or
result
had
aged
her
prematurely
and
although
she
was
still
young
she
did
not
seem
so
it
might
be
said
of
her
that
with
her
habits
and
manner
of
life
she
had
wrought
a
sort
of
rind
a
stony
insensible
covering
within
which
she
shut
herself
like
the
snail
within
his
portable
house
dona
perfecta
rarely
came
out
of
her
shell
her
irreproachable
habits
and
that
outward
amiability
which
we
have
observed
in
her
from
the
moment
of
her
appearance
in
our
story
were
the
causes
of
the
great
prestige
which
she
enjoyed
in
orbajosa
she
kept
up
relations
besides
with
some
excellent
ladies
in
madrid
and
it
was
through
their
means
that
she
obtained
the
dismissal
of
her
nephew
at
the
moment
which
we
have
now
arrived
in
our
story
we
find
her
seated
at
her
desk
which
is
the
sole
confidant
of
her
plans
and
the
depository
of
her
numerical
accounts
with
the
peasants
and
of
her
moral
accounts
with
god
and
with
society
there
she
wrote
the
letters
which
her
brother
received
every
three
months
there
she
composed
the
notes
that
incited
the
judge
and
the
notary
to
embroil
pepe
rey
in
lawsuits
there
she
prepared
the
plot
through
which
the
latter
lost
the
confidence
of
the
government
there
she
held
long
conferences
with
don
inocencio
to
become
acquainted
with
the
scene
of
others
of
her
actions
whose
effects
we
have
observed
it
would
be
necessary
to
follow
her
to
the
episcopal
palace
and
to
the
houses
of
various
of
her
friends
we
do
not
know
what
dona
perfecta
would
have
been
loving
hating
she
had
the
fiery
vehemence
of
an
angel
of
hatred
and
discord
among
men
such
is
the
effect
produced
on
a
character
naturally
hard
and
without
inborn
goodness
by
religious
exaltation
when
this
instead
of
drawing
its
nourishment
from
conscience
and
from
truth
revealed
in
principles
as
simple
as
they
are
beautiful
seeks
its
sap
in
narrow
formulas
dictated
solely
by
ecclesiastical
interests
in
order
that
religious
fanaticism
should
be
inoffensive
the
heart
in
which
it
exists
must
be
very
pure
it
is
true
that
even
in
that
case
it
is
unproductive
of
good
but
the
hearts
that
have
been
born
without
the
seraphic
purity
which
establishes
a
premature
limbo
on
the
earth
are
careful
not
to
become
greatly
inflamed
with
what
they
see
in
retables
in
choirs
in
locutories
and
sacristies
unless
they
have
first
erected
in
their
own
consciences
an
altar
a
pulpit
and
a
confessional
dona
perfecta
left
her
writing
from
time
to
time
to
go
into
the
adjoining
room
where
her
daughter
was
rosarito
had
been
ordered
to
sleep
but
already
precipitated
down
the
precipice
of
disobedience
she
was
awake
why
don
t
you
sleep
her
mother
asked
her
i
don
t
intend
to
go
to

you
know
already
that
caballuco

taken
away
with
him
the
men

had
here
something

happen
and
i
will
keep
watch
if
i
did
not
watch
what
would
become
of
us
both
what
time
is
it
asked
the
girl
it
will
soon
be
midnight
perhaps
you
are
not
afraid
but
i
rosarito
was
trembling
and
every
thing
about
her
denoted
the
keenest
anxiety
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
heaven
supplicatingly
and
then
turned
them
on
her
mother
with
a
look
of
the
utmost
terror
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
did
you
not
say
it
was
midnight
then
but
is
it
already

rosario
made
an
effort
to

then
shook
her
head
on
which
the
weight
of
a
world
was
pressing
something

the
matter
with
you
you
have
something
on
your

said
her

fixing
on
her

her
penetrating

into
a

and

her
mother
embracing
her
if
they
are
tears
of
repentance
blessed

i
don
t

cried
the
girl
in
a
burst
of
sublime
despair
she
lifted
her
head
and
in
her
face
was
depicted
a
sudden
inspired
strength
her
hair
fell
in
disorder
over
her
shoulders
never
was
there
seen
a
more
beautiful
image
of
a
rebellious
angel
what
is
this

you
lost

both
her

the

dona

felt
a
flood
of
fire
surging
from
her
heart
up
to
her
lips
she
controlled
herself
however
and
answered
her
daughter
only
with
her
eyes
blacker
than
the
night

springing
back
several
paces
from
her
daughter

followed
her
on
her
knees
at
the
same
instant
three
blows
were
heard
three
crashes
three
reports
it
was
the
heart
of
maria
remedios
knocking
at
the
door
through
the
knocker
the
house
trembled
with
awful
dread
mother
and
daughter
stood
motionless
as
statues
a
servant
went
down
stairs
to
open
the
door
and
shortly
afterward
maria
remedios
who
was
not
now
a
woman
but
a
basilisk
enveloped
in
a
mantle
entered
dona

s
room
her
face
flushed
with
anxiety
exhaled
fire
he
is
there

said
as
she
entered
he
got
into
the
garden
through
the
condemned
she
paused
for
breath
at
every
syllable
i
know
already
returned
dona

with
a
sort
of
bellow

fell
senseless
on
the
floor
let
us
go
down
stairs
said
dona

without
paying
any
attention
to
her
daughter
s
swoon
the
two
women
glided
down
stairs
like
two
snakes
the
maids
and
the
were
in
the
hall
not
knowing
what
to

passed
through

into
the

by
maria

fortunately
we
have
there
said
the
canon

where
in
the

also
he
over
the
dona

explored
the
darkness
with
her
wrathful
eyes

gave
them
the
singular
power
of

april
my
dear
friend
send
me
without
delay
the
edition
of
that
you
say
you
have
picked
up
at
the
executor
s
sale
of
the
books
of
corchuelo
i
will
pay
any
price
for
that
copy
i
have
been
long
searching
for
it
in
vain
and
i
shall
esteem
myself
the
most
enviable
of
virtuosos
in
possessing
it
you
ought
to
find
in
the
colophon
a
helmet
with
a
motto
over
the
word
tractado
and
the
tail
of
the
x
of
the
date
mdlxii
ought
to
be
crooked
if
your
copy
agrees
with
these
signs
send
me
a
telegraphic
despatch
at
once
for
i
shall
be
very
anxious
until
i
receive
it
but
now
i
remember
that
on
account
of
these
vexatious
and
troublesome
wars
the
telegraph
is
not
working
i
shall
await
your
answer
by
return
of
mail
i
shall
soon
go
to
madrid
for
the
purpose
of
having
my
long
delayed
work
the
genealogies
of
orbajosa
printed
i
appreciate
your
kindness
my
dear
friend
but
i
can
not
accept
your
too
flattering
expressions
my
work
does
not
indeed
deserve
the
high
encomiums
you
bestow
upon
it
it
is
a
work
of
patience
and
study
a
rude
but
solid
and
massive
monument
which
i
shall
have
erected
to
the
past
glories
of
my
beloved
country
plain
and
humble
in
its
form
it
is
noble
in
the
idea
that
inspired
it
which
was
solely
to
direct
the
eyes
of
this
proud
and
unbelieving
generation
to
the
marvellous
deeds
and
the
pure
virtues
of
our
forefathers
would
that
the
studious
youth
of
our
country
might
take
the
step
to
which
with
all
my
strength
i
incite
them
would
that
the
abominable
studies
and
methods
of
reasoning
introduced
by
philosophic
license
and
erroneous
doctrines
might
be
forever
cast
into
oblivion
would
that
our
learned
men
might
occupy
themselves
exclusively
in
the
contemplation
of
those
glorious
ages
in
order
that
this
generation
being
penetrated
with
their
essence
and
their
beneficent
sap
its
insane
eagerness
for
change
and
its
ridiculous
mania
for
appropriating
to
itself
foreign
ideas
which
conflict
with
our
beautiful
national
constitution
might
disappear
i
fear
greatly
that
among
the
crowd
of
mad
youth
who
pursue
vain
utopias
and
heathenish
novelties
my
desires
are
not
destined
to
be
fulfilled
and
that
the
contemplation
of
the
illustrious
virtues
of
the
past
will
remain
confined
within
the
same
narrow
circle
as
what
is
to
be
done
my
friend
i
am
afraid
that
very
soon
our
poor
spain
is
doomed
to
be
so
disfigured
that
she
will
not
be
able
to
recognize
herself
even
beholding
herself
in
the
bright
mirror
of
her
stainless
history
i
do
not
wish
to
close
this
letter
without
informing
you
of
a
disagreeable
event
the
unfortunate
death
of
an
estimable
young
man
well
known
in
madrid
the
civil
engineer
don
jose
de
rey
a
nephew
of
my
this
melancholy
event
occurred
last
night
in
the
garden
of
our
house
and
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
form
a
correct
judgment
regarding
the
causes
that
may
have
impelled
the
unfortunate
rey
to
this
horrible
and
criminal
act
according
to
what
perfecta
told
me
this
morning
on
my
return
from
mundo
grande
pepe
rey
at
about
twelve
o
clock
last
night
entered
the
garden
of
the
house
and
shot
himself
in
the
right
temple
expiring
instantly
imagine
the
consternation
and
alarm
which
such
an
event
would
produce
in
this
peaceable
and
virtuous
mansion
poor
perfecta
was
so
greatly
affected
that
we
were
for
a
time
alarmed
about
her
but
she
is
better
now
and
this
afternoon
we
succeeded
in
inducing
her
to
take
a
little
broth
we
employ
every
means
of
consoling
her
and
as
she
is
a
good
christian
she
knows
how
to
support
with
edifying
resignation
even
so
great
a
misfortune
as
this
between
you
and
me
my
friend
i
will
say
here
that
in
young
rey
s
fatal
attempt
upon
his
life
i
believe
the
moving
causes
to
have
been
an
unfortunate
attachment
perhaps
remorse
for
his
conduct
and
the
state
of
hypochondriasm
into
which
he
had
fallen
i
esteemed
him
greatly
i
think
he
was
not
lacking
in
excellent
qualities
but
he
was
held
in
such
disrepute
here
that
never
once
have
i
heard
any
one
speak
well
of
him
according
to
what
they
say
he
made
a
boast
of
the
most
extravagant
ideas
and
opinions
he
mocked
at
religion
entered
the
church
smoking
and
with
his
hat
on
he
respected
nothing
and
for
him
there
was
neither
modesty
nor
virtue
nor
soul
nor
ideal
nor
faith
nothing
but
theodolites
squares
rules
engines
and
spades
what
do
you
thing
of
that
to
be
just
i
must
say
that
in
his
conversations
with
me
he
always
concealed
these
ideas
doubtless
through
fear
of
being
utterly
routed
by
the
fire
of
my
arguments
but
in
public
innumerable
stories
are
told
of
his
heretical
ideas
and
his
stupendous
excesses
i
can
not
continue
my
dear
friend
for
at
this
moment
i
hear
firing
as
i
have
no
love
for
fighting
and
as
i
am
not
a
soldier
my
pulse
trembles
a
little
in
due
time
i
will
give
you
further
particulars
of
this
war
yours
affectionately
april
my
friend
we
have
had
a
bloody
skirmish
on
the
outskirts
of
orbajosa
the
large
body
of
men
raised
in
villahorrenda
were
attacked
by
the
troops
with
great
fury
there
was
great
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
on
both
sides
after
the
combat
the
brave
guerillas
dispersed
but
they
are
greatly
encouraged
and
it
is
possible
that
you
may
hear
of
wonderful
things
cristobal
caballuco
the
son
of
the
famous
caballuco
whom
you
will
remember
in
the
last
war
though
suffering
from
a
wound
in
the
arm
how
or
when
received
is
not
known
commanded
them
the
present
leader
has
eminent
qualifications
for
the
command
and
he
is
besides
an
honest
and
man
as
we
must
finally
come
to
a
friendly
arrangement
i
presume
that
caballuco
will
be
made
a
general
in
the
spanish
army
whereby
both
sides
will
gain
greatly
i
deplore
this
war
which
is
beginning
to
assume
alarming
proportions
but
i
recognize
that
our
valiant
peasants
are
not
responsible
for
it
since
they
have
been
provoked
to
the
inhuman
conflict
by
the
audacity
of
the
government
by
the
demoralization
of
its
sacrilegious
delegates
by
the
systematic
fury
with
which
the
representatives
of
the
state
attack
what
is
most
venerated
by
the
people
their
religious
faith
and
the
national
spirit
which
fortunately
still
exists
in
those
places
that
are
not
yet
contaminated
by
the
desolating
pestilence
when
it
is
attempted
to
take
away
the
soul
of
a
people
to
give
it
a
different
one
when
it
is
sought
to
denationalize
a
people
so
to
say
perverting
its
sentiments
its
customs
its
ideas
it
is
natural
that
this
people
should
defend
itself
like
the
man
who
is
attacked
by
highwaymen
on
a
solitary
road
let
the
spirit
and
the
pure
and
salutiferous
substance
of
my
work
on
the
genealogies
excuse
the
apparent
vanity
once
reach
the
sphere
of
the
government
and
there
will
no
longer
be
wars
we
have
had
here
a
very
disagreeable
question
the
clergy
my
friend
have
refused
to
allow
rey
to
be
buried
in
consecrated
ground
i
interfered
in
the
matter
entreating
the
bishop
to
remove
this
heavy
anathema
but
without
success
finally
we
buried
the
body
of
the
young
man
in
a
grave
made
in
the
field
of
mundo
grande
where
my
patient
explorations
have
discovered
the
archaeological
treasures
of
which
you
know
i
spent
some
very
sad
hours
and
the
painful
impression
which
i
received
has
not
yet
altogether
passed
away
don
juan
tafetan
and
ourselves
were
the
only
persons
who
accompanied
the
funeral
cortege
a
little
later
strange
to
say
the
girls
whom
they
call
here
the
troyas
went
to
the
field
and
prayed
for
a
long
time
beside
the
rustic
tomb
of
the
mathematician
although
this
seemed
a
ridiculous
piece
of
officiousness
it
touched
me
with
respect
to
the
death
of
rey
the
rumor
circulates
throughout
the
town
that
he
was
assassinated
but
by
whom
is
not
known
it
is
asserted
that
he
declared
this
to
be
the
case
for
he
lived
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
according
to
what
they
say
he
refused
to
reveal
the
name
of
his
murderer
i
repeat
this
version
without
either
contradicting
or
supporting
it
perfecta
does
not
wish
this
matter
to
be
spoken
of
and
she
becomes
greatly
distressed
whenever
i
allude
to
it
poor
woman
no
sooner
had
one
misfortune
occurred
than
she
met
with
another
which
has
grieved
us
all
deeply
my
friend
the
fatal
malady
that
has
been
for
so
many
generations
connatural
in
our
family
has
now
claimed
another
victim
poor
rosario
who
thanks
to
our
cares
was
improving
gradually
in
her
health
has
entirely
lost
her
reason
her
incoherent
words
her
frenzy
her
deadly
pallor
bring
my
mother
and
my
sister
forcibly
to
my
mind
this
is
the
most
serious
case
that
i
have
witnessed
in
our
family
for
the
question
here
is
not
one
of
mania
but
of
real
insanity
it
is
sad
terribly
sad
that
out
of
so
many
i
should
be
the
only
one
to
escape
preserving
a
sound
mind
with
all
my
faculties
unimpaired
and
entirely
free
from
any
sign
of
that
fatal
malady
i
have
not
been
able
to
give
your
remembrances
to
don
inocencio
for
the
poor
man
has
suddenly
fallen
ill
and
refuses
to
see
even
his
most
intimate
friends
but
i
am
sure
that
he
would
return
your
remembrances
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
could
lay
his
hand
instantly
on
the
translation
of
the
collection
of
latin
epigrams
which
you
recommend
to
him
i
hear
firing
again
they
say
that
we
shall
have
a
skirmish
this
afternoon
the
troops
have
just
been
called
barcelona
june
i
have
just
arrived
here
after
leaving
my
niece
in
san
baudilio
de
llobregat
the
director
of
the
establishment
has
assured
me
that
the
case
is
incurable
she
will
however
have
the
greatest
care
in
that
cheerful
and
magnificent
sanitarium
my
dear
friend
if
i
also
should
ever
succumb
let
me
be
taken
to
san
baudilio
i
hope
to
find
the
proofs
of
my
genealogies
awaiting
me
on
my
return
i
intend
to
add
six
pages
more
for
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
not
to
publish
my
reasons
for
maintaining
that
mateo
diez
coronel
author
of
the
metrico
encomio
is
descended
on
the
mother
s
side
from
the
guevaras
and
not
from
the
burguillos
as
the
author
of
the
floresta
amena
erroneously
maintains
i
write
this
letter
principally
for
the
purpose
of
giving
you
a
caution
i
have
heard
several
persons
here
speaking
of
pepe
rey
s
death
and
they
describe
it
exactly
as
it
occurred
the
secret
of
the
manner
of
his
death
which
i
learned
some
time
after
the
event
i
revealed
to
you
in
confidence
when
we
met
in
madrid
it
has
appeared
strange
to
me
that
having
told
it
to
no
one
but
yourself
it
should
be
known
here
in
all
its
details
how
he
entered
the
garden
how
he
fired
on
caballuco
when
the
latter
attacked
him
with
his
dagger
how
ramos
then
fired
on
him
with
so
sure
an
aim
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
mortally
wounded
in
short
my
dear
friend
in
case
you
should
have
inadvertently
spoken
of
this
to
any
one
i
will
remind
you
that
it
is
a
family
secret
and
that
will
be
sufficient
for
a
person
as
prudent
and
discreet
as
yourself
joy
joy
i
have
just
read
in
one
of
the
papers
here
that
caballuco
had
defeated
brigadier
orbajosa
december
i
have
a
sad
piece
of
news
to
give
you
the
penitentiary
has
ceased
to
exist
for
us
not
precisely
because
he
has
passed
to
a
better
life
but
because
the
poor
man
has
been
ever
since
last
april
so
so
melancholy
so
taciturn
that
you
would
not
know
him
there
is
no
longer
in
him
even
a
trace
of
that
attic
humor
that
decorous
and
classic
joviality
which
made
him
so
pleasing
he
shuns
every
body
he
shuts
himself
up
in
his
house
and
receives
no
one
he
hardly
eats
any
thing
and
he
has
broken
off
all
intercourse
with
the
world
if
you
were
to
see
him
now
you
would
not
recognize
him
for
he
is
reduced
to
skin
and
bone
the
strangest
part
of
the
matter
is
that
he
has
quarreled
with
his
niece
and
lives
alone
entirely
alone
in
a
miserable
cottage
in
the
suburb
of
baidejos
they
say
now
that
he
will
resign
his
chair
in
the
choir
of
the
cathedral
and
go
to
rome
ah
orbajosa
will
lose
much
in
losing
her
great
latinist
i
imagine
that
many
a
year
will
pass
before
we
shall
see
such
another
our
glorious
spain
is
falling
into
decay
declining
orbajosa
december
the
young
man
who
will
present
to
you
a
letter
of
introduction
from
me
is
the
nephew
of
our
dear
penitentiary
a
lawyer
with
some
literary
ability
carefully
educated
by
his
uncle
he
has
very
sensible
ideas
how
regrettable
it
would
be
if
he
should
become
corrupted
in
that
sink
of
philosophy
and
incredulity
he
is
upright
industrious
and
a
good
catholic
for
which
reasons
i
believe
that
in
an
office
like
yours
he
will
rise
to
distinction
in
his
profession
perhaps
his
ambition
may
lead
him
for
he
has
ambition
too
into
the
political
arena
and
i
think
he
would
not
be
a
bad
acquisition
to
the
cause
of
order
and
tradition
now
that
the
majority
of
our
young
men
have
become
perverted
and
have
joined
the
ranks
of
the
turbulent
and
the
vicious
he
is
accompanied
by
his
mother
a
commonplace
woman
without
any
social
polish
but
who
has
an
excellent
heart
and
who
is
truly
pious
maternal
affection
takes
in
her
the
somewhat
extravagant
form
of
worldly
ambition
and
she
declares
that
her
son
will
one
day
be
minister
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
may
perfecta
desires
to
be
remembered
to
you
i
don
t
know
precisely
what
is
the
matter
with
her
but
the
fact
is
she
gives
us
great
uneasiness
she
has
lost
her
appetite
to
an
alarming
degree
and
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
in
my
opinion
of
her
case
she
shows
the
first
symptoms
of
jaundice
the
house
is
very
sad
without
rosarito
who
brightened
it
with
her
smiles
and
her
angelic
goodness
a
black
cloud
seems
to
rest
now
over
us
all
poor
perfecta
speaks
frequently
of
this
cloud
which
is
growing
blacker
and
blacker
while
she
becomes
every
day
more
yellow
the
poor
mother
finds
consolation
for
her
grief
in
religion
and
in
devotional
exercises
which
each
day
she
practises
with
a
more
exemplary
and
edifying
piety
she
passes
almost
the
whole
of
the
day
in
church
and
she
spends
her
large
income
in
novenas
and
in
splendid
religious
ceremonies
thanks
to
her
religious
worship
has
recovered
in
orbajosa
its
former
splendor
this
is
some
consolation
in
the
midst
of
the
decay
and
dissolution
of
our
nationality
i
will
send
the
proofs
i
will
add
a
few
pages
more
for
i
have
discovered
another
illustrious
orbajosan
bernardo
amador
de
sota
who
was
footman
to
the
duke
of
osuna
whom
he
served
during
the
period
of
the
of
naples
and
there
is
even
good
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
no
complicity
whatever
in
the
conspiracy
against
our
story
is
ended
this
is
all
we
have
to
say
for
the
present
concerning
persons
who
seem
but
are
not
good
