upon
a
hanging
precipice
atop
of
the
eagle
scout
butte
there
appeared
a
motionless
and
solitary
figure
almost
he
perched
the
people
in
the
camp
below
saw
him
but
none
looked
at
him
long
they
turned
their
heads
quickly
away
with
a
nervous
tingling
for
the
height
above
the
plains
was
great
almost
among
the
upper
clouds
the
young
warrior
sat
immovable
it
was
antelope
he
was
fasting
and
seeking
a
sign
from
the
great
mystery
for
such
was
the
first
step
of
the
young
and
ambitious
sioux
who
wished
to
be
a
noted
warrior
among
his
people
he
is
a
princely
youth
among
the
wild
sioux
who
hunts
for
his
tribe
and
not
for
himself
his
voice
is
soft
and
low
at
the
campfire
of
his
nation
but
in
the
field
of
battle
such
was
antelope
s
reputation
the
more
he
sought
the
great
mystery
in
solitude
the
more
gentle
and
retiring
he
became
and
in
the
same
proportion
his
courage
and
manliness
grew
none
could
say
that
he
was
not
a
kind
son
and
a
good
hunter
for
he
had
already
passed
the
his
buffalo
examination
on
a
hot
midsummer
morning
a
few
weeks
later
while
most
of
the
inmates
of
the
teepees
were
breakfasting
in
the
open
air
the
powerful
voice
of
the
herald
resounded
among
the
heights
and
green
valleys
hear
ye
hear
ye
warriors
he
chanted
loudly
the
council
has
decreed
that
four
brave
young
men
must
scout
the
country
to
the
sunsetward
of
the
camp
for
the
peace
and
protection
of
our
people
all
listened
eagerly
for
the
names
of
the
chosen
warriors
and
in
another
moment
there
came
the
sonorous
call
antelope
antelope
the
council
has
selected
you
the
camp
was
large
fully
four
hundred
paces
across
but
in
that
country
in
the
clear
morning
air
such
an
announcement
can
be
heard
a
great
way
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
hills
repeated
over
and
over
the
musical
name
of
antelope
in
due
time
the
four
chosen
youths
appeared
before
the
council
fire
the
oath
of
the
pipe
was
administered
and
each
took
a
few
whiffs
as
reverently
as
a
churchman
would
partake
of
the
sacrament
the
chief
of
the
council
who
was
old
and
of
a
striking
appearance
gave
the
charge
and
command
to
the
youthful
braves
there
was
a
score
or
more
of
warriors
ready
mounted
to
escort
them
beyond
the
precincts
of
the
camp
and
the
fearless
heart
song
was
sung
according
to
the
custom
as
the
four
ran
lightly
from
the
door
of
the
council
teepee
and
disappeared
in
the
woods
it
was
a
peculiarly
trying
and
hazardous
moment
in
which
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
scout
the
sioux
were
encroaching
upon
the
territory
of
hostile
tribes
here
in
the
of
the
big
horn
mountains
and
now
and
then
one
of
their
hunters
was
cut
off
by
the
enemy
if
continual
vigilance
could
not
save
them
it
might
soon
become
necessary
to
retreat
to
their
own
it
was
a
savage
fetish
that
a
warrior
must
be
proof
against
the
alluring
ways
of
pretty
maidens
that
he
must
place
his
honor
far
above
the
temptations
of
and
indolence
cold
hunger
and
personal
hardship
did
not
count
with
antelope
when
there
was
required
of
him
any
special
exertion
for
the
common
good
it
was
cause
to
him
of
secret
satisfaction
that
the
had
selected
him
for
a
dangerous
service
in
preference
to
some
of
his
rivals
and
comrades
he
had
been
running
for
two
or
three
hours
at
a
good
even
gait
and
had
crossed
more
than
one
of
the
smaller
creeks
yet
many
deep
gulches
and
bad
lands
lay
between
him
and
the
furthest
peak
that
melted
into
the
blue
dome
above
i
shall
stand
upon
the
bear
s
heart
he
said
to
himself
if
i
can
do
that
and
still
report
before
the
others
i
shall
do
well
his
keen
eyes
were
constantly
sweeping
the
country
in
his
front
and
suddenly
he
paused
and
shrank
back
motionless
in
a
crouching
attitude
still
steadily
keeping
an
eye
upon
a
moving
object
it
was
soon
evident
that
some
one
was
stealthily
eying
him
from
behind
cover
and
he
was
outwitted
by
the
enemy
still
stooping
he
glided
down
a
little
ravine
and
as
he
reached
the
bed
of
the
creek
there
emerged
from
it
a
large
gray
wolf
this
was
very
opportune
for
antelope
he
gave
the
gray
wolf
s
with
all
his
might
waited
an
instant
and
gave
it
a
second
time
then
he
turned
and
ran
fleetly
down
the
stream
at
the
same
moment
the
wolf
appeared
upon
the
top
of
the
bank
in
full
view
of
the
enemy
here
he
comes
they
whispered
and
had
their
arrows
on
the
string
as
the
wolf
trotted
leisurely
along
exposing
only
his
head
for
this
was
a
common
disguise
among
the
plains
indians
but
when
he
came
out
into
the
open
behold
it
was
only
a
gray
wolf
ugh
the
utes
grunted
as
they
looked
at
each
other
in
much
chagrin
surely
he
was
a
man
and
coming
directly
into
our
trap
we
sang
and
prayed
to
the
gods
of
war
when
our
war
chief
sent
us
ahead
to
scout
the
sioux
people
to
find
their
camp
this
is
a
mystery
a
magic
either
he
is
a
sioux
in
disguise
or
we
don
t
know
their
tricks
exclaimed
the
leader
now
they
gave
the
and
their
arrows
flew
through
the
air
the
wolf
gave
a
yelp
of
distress
staggered
and
fell
dead
instantly
they
ran
to
examine
the
body
and
found
it
to
be
truly
that
of
a
wolf
either
this
is
a
wonderful
or
we
are
shamefully
fooled
by
a
sioux
warrior
they
muttered
they
lost
several
minutes
before
they
caught
sight
of
antelope
who
had
followed
the
bed
of
the
creek
as
far
as
it
lay
in
his
direction
and
then
came
out
of
it
at
full
speed
it
would
be
safer
for
him
to
remain
in
concealment
until
dark
but
in
the
meantime
the
ute
warriors
would
reach
the
camp
and
his
people
were
unprepared
it
was
necessary
to
expose
himself
to
the
enemy
he
knew
that
it
would
be
chiefly
a
contest
of
speed
and
he
had
an
excellent
start
but
on
the
other
hand
the
utes
doubtless
had
their
horses
the
sioux
who
played
this
trick
on
us
must
die
exclaimed
their
leader
come
friends
we
can
not
afford
to
let
him
tell
this
joke
on
us
at
the
of
his
people
antelope
was
headed
directly
for
eagle
scout
butte
for
the
camp
was
in
plain
view
from
the
top
of
this
hill
he
had
run
pretty
much
all
day
but
then
that
was
nothing
i
shall
reach
the
summit
first
unless
the
ute
horses
have
wings
he
said
to
himself
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
five
horsemen
approaching
so
he
examined
his
bow
and
arrows
as
he
ran
all
is
well
he
muttered
one
of
their
spirits
at
the
least
must
guide
mine
to
the
spirit
land
where
it
was
believed
by
them
there
was
no
fighting
now
he
was
within
hearing
of
their
whoops
but
he
was
already
at
the
foot
of
the
butte
their
horses
could
not
run
up
the
steep
ascent
and
they
were
obliged
to
dismount
like
a
deer
the
sioux
leaped
from
rock
to
rock
and
almost
within
came
his
pursuers
wildly
whooping
and
yelling
when
he
had
achieved
the
summit
he
took
his
stand
between
two
great
rocks
and
flashed
his
tiny
for
a
distress
signal
into
the
distant
camp
of
his
people
for
a
long
time
no
reply
came
and
many
arrows
flew
over
his
head
as
the
utes
approached
gradually
from
rock
to
rock
he
too
sent
down
a
swift
arrow
now
and
then
to
show
them
that
he
was
no
child
or
woman
in
fight
but
brave
as
a
bear
when
it
is
brought
to
bay
ho
ho
he
shouted
to
the
enemy
in
token
of
a
brave
man
s
welcome
to
danger
and
death
they
replied
with
yells
of
triumph
as
they
pressed
more
and
more
closely
upon
him
one
of
their
number
had
been
dispatched
to
notify
the
main
when
they
first
saw
antelope
but
he
did
not
know
this
and
his
courage
was
undiminished
from
time
to
time
he
continued
to
flash
his
signal
and
at
last
like
lightning
the
little
white
flash
came
in
reply
the
sun
was
low
when
the
besieged
warrior
discovered
a
large
body
of
horsemen
approaching
from
the
northwest
it
was
the
ute
warparty
he
looked
earnestly
once
more
toward
the
sioux
camp
shading
his
eyes
with
his
right
palm
there
too
were
many
moving
specks
upon
the
plain
drawing
toward
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
they
had
caught
his
distress
signal
and
the
entire
camp
was
thrown
into
confusion
for
but
few
of
the
men
had
returned
from
the
daily
hunt
as
fast
as
they
came
in
the
warriors
hurried
away
upon
their
best
horses
singing
and
yelling
when
they
reached
the
butte
towering
abruptly
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
they
could
distinguish
their
enemies
massed
behind
the
hanging
rocks
and
scattered
crawling
up
closer
and
closer
for
the
large
warparty
reached
the
hill
just
as
the
scouts
who
held
antelope
at
bay
discovered
the
approach
of
his
kinsmen
antelope
had
long
since
exhausted
his
quiver
of
arrows
and
was
gathering
up
many
of
those
that
fell
about
him
to
send
them
back
among
his
pursuers
when
their
attention
was
withdrawn
from
him
for
an
instant
by
the
sudden
onset
of
the
sioux
he
sprang
to
his
feet
he
raised
both
his
hands
heavenward
in
token
of
gratitude
for
his
rescue
and
his
friends
announced
with
loud
shouts
the
daring
of
antelope
both
sides
fought
bravely
but
the
utes
at
last
retreated
and
were
fiercely
pursued
antelope
stood
at
his
full
height
upon
the
huge
rock
that
had
sheltered
him
and
gave
his
yell
of
defiance
and
exultation
below
him
the
warriors
took
it
up
and
among
the
gathering
shadows
the
rocks
echoed
praises
of
his
name
in
the
sioux
camp
upon
lost
water
there
were
dances
and
praise
songs
but
there
was
wailing
and
mourning
too
for
many
lay
dead
among
the
crags
the
name
of
antelope
was
indelibly
recorded
upon
eagle
scout
butte
if
he
wished
for
a
of
eagle
feathers
it
is
his
to
wear
declared
one
of
the
young
men
but
he
is
modest
and
scarcely
even
joins
in
the
scalp
dances
it
is
said
of
him
that
he
has
never
yet
spoken
to
any
young
woman
true
it
is
not
announced
publicly
that
he
has
addressed
a
maiden
many
parents
would
like
to
have
their
daughters
the
first
one
he
would
speak
to
but
i
am
told
he
desires
to
go
upon
one
or
two
more
before
seeking
woman
s
company
replied
another
hun
hun
hay
exclaimed
a
third
youth
he
is
already
old
enough
to
be
a
father
this
is
told
of
him
rejoined
the
first
speaker
he
wants
to
hold
the
record
of
being
the
young
man
who
made
the
greatest
number
of
coups
before
he
spoke
to
a
maiden
i
know
that
there
are
not
only
mothers
who
would
be
glad
to
have
him
for
a
but
their
young
daughters
would
not
refuse
to
look
upon
the
brave
antelope
as
a
husband
it
was
true
that
in
the
dance
his
name
was
often
mentioned
and
at
every
repetition
it
seemed
that
the
young
women
danced
with
more
spirit
while
even
grandmothers
joined
in
the
whirl
with
a
show
of
youthful
abandon
wezee
the
father
of
antelope
was
receiving
congratulations
throughout
the
afternoon
many
of
the
old
men
came
to
his
lodge
to
smoke
with
him
and
the
host
was
more
than
gratified
for
he
was
of
a
common
family
and
had
never
before
known
what
it
is
to
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
popularity
and
distinction
he
spoke
complacently
as
he
crowded
a
handful
of
tobacco
into
the
bowl
of
the
long
red
pipe
friends
our
life
here
is
short
and
the
life
of
a
brave
youth
is
apt
to
be
shorter
than
most
we
crave
all
the
happiness
that
we
can
get
and
it
is
right
that
we
should
do
so
one
who
says
that
he
does
not
care
for
reputation
or
success
is
not
likely
to
be
telling
the
truth
so
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
say
too
much
about
the
honorable
career
of
my
this
was
the
old
man
s
philosophic
apology
ho
ho
his
guests
graciously
responded
it
is
your
moon
every
moon
has
its
fullness
when
it
lights
up
the
night
while
the
little
stars
dance
before
it
so
to
every
man
there
comes
his
full
moon
somewhat
later
in
the
day
all
the
young
people
of
the
great
camp
were
seen
to
be
moving
in
one
direction
all
wore
their
best
attire
and
finest
ornaments
and
even
the
steeds
were
decorated
to
the
satisfaction
of
their
riders
ugh
taluta
is
making
a
maidens
feast
she
the
prettiest
of
all
the
unkpapa
maidens
exclaimed
one
of
the
young
braves
she
the
handsomest
of
all
our
young
women
repeated
another
taluta
was
indeed
a
handsome
maid
in
the
height
and
bloom
of
womanhood
with
all
that
wonderful
freshness
and
magnetism
which
was
developed
and
preserved
by
the
life
of
the
wilderness
she
had
already
given
five
maidens
feasts
beginning
with
her
fifteenth
year
and
her
shy
and
diffident
purity
was
held
sacred
by
her
people
the
maidens
circle
was
now
complete
behind
it
the
outer
circle
of
old
women
was
equally
picturesque
and
even
more
dignified
the
grandmother
not
the
mother
was
regarded
as
the
natural
protector
of
the
young
maiden
and
the
dowagers
derived
much
honor
from
their
position
especially
upon
public
occasions
taking
to
themselves
no
small
amount
of
credit
for
the
good
reputations
of
their
charges
weshawee
whose
protege
had
many
suitors
and
was
a
decided
coquette
fidgeted
nervously
and
frequently
adjusted
her
robe
or
fingered
her
necklace
to
ease
her
mind
for
she
dreaded
lest
in
spite
of
watchfulness
some
mishap
might
have
befallen
her
charge
her
anxiety
was
apparently
shared
by
several
other
chaperons
who
stole
occasional
suspicious
glances
in
the
direction
of
certain
of
the
young
braves
it
had
been
known
to
happen
that
a
girl
unworthy
to
join
in
the
sacred
feast
was
publicly
disgraced
a
special
police
force
was
appointed
to
keep
order
on
this
occasion
each
member
of
which
was
gorgeously
painted
and
bedecked
with
eagle
feathers
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
long
switch
with
which
to
threaten
the
encroaching
throng
their
horses
wore
of
fierce
animals
to
add
to
their
appearance
the
wild
youths
formed
the
outer
circle
of
the
gathering
attired
like
the
woods
in
autumn
their
long
locks
glossy
with
oil
and
perfumed
with
scented
grass
and
leaves
many
pulled
their
blankets
over
their
heads
as
if
to
avoid
recognition
and
loitered
shyly
at
a
distance
among
these
last
were
antelope
and
his
cousin
red
eagle
they
stood
in
the
angle
formed
by
the
bodies
of
their
steeds
whose
noses
were
together
the
young
hero
was
completely
enveloped
in
his
handsome
robe
with
a
rainbow
of
acros
the
middle
and
his
small
moccasined
feet
projected
from
beneath
the
lower
border
red
eagle
held
up
an
fan
partially
concealing
his
face
and
both
gazed
intently
toward
the
center
of
the
maidens
circle
woo
woo
was
the
sonorous
exclamation
of
the
police
announcing
the
beginning
of
the
ceremonies
in
the
midst
of
the
ring
of
girls
stood
the
traditional
red
stone
with
its
bristling
hedge
of
arrows
in
this
case
there
were
five
arrows
indicating
that
taluta
had
already
made
as
many
maidens
feasts
each
of
the
maidens
must
lay
her
hand
upon
the
stone
in
token
of
her
purity
and
chastity
touching
also
as
many
arrows
as
she
herself
has
attended
maidens
feasts
taluta
advanced
first
to
the
center
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
beside
the
sacred
stone
she
appeared
to
the
gazing
bystanders
the
embodiment
of
grace
and
modesty
her
gown
adorned
with
long
fringes
at
the
seams
was
beaded
in
blue
and
white
across
the
shoulders
and
half
way
to
her
waist
her
shining
black
hair
was
arranged
in
two
thick
plaits
which
hung
down
upon
her
bosom
there
was
a
native
dignity
in
her
gestures
and
in
her
utterance
of
the
maidens
oath
and
as
she
turned
to
face
the
circle
all
the
other
virgins
followed
her
when
the
feast
was
ended
and
the
gay
concourse
had
dispersed
antelope
and
his
cousin
were
among
the
last
to
withdraw
the
young
man
s
eyes
had
followed
every
movement
of
taluta
as
long
as
she
remained
in
sight
and
it
was
only
when
she
vanished
in
the
gathering
shadows
that
he
was
willing
to
retire
in
savage
courtship
it
was
the
custom
to
introduce
one
s
self
boldly
to
the
young
lady
although
sometimes
it
was
convenient
to
have
a
sister
introduce
her
brother
but
antelope
had
no
sister
to
perform
this
office
for
him
and
if
he
had
had
one
he
would
not
have
made
the
request
he
did
not
choose
to
admit
any
one
to
his
secret
for
he
had
no
confidence
in
himself
or
in
the
outcome
of
the
affair
if
it
had
been
anything
like
trailing
the
doe
or
scouting
the
ojibway
he
would
have
ridiculed
the
very
notion
of
missing
the
object
sought
but
this
was
a
new
warfare
an
unknown
hunting
although
he
was
very
anxious
to
meet
taluta
whenever
the
idea
occurred
to
him
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
and
profuse
perspiration
rolled
down
his
stoic
visage
it
was
not
customary
to
hold
any
social
intercourse
with
the
members
of
the
opposite
sex
and
he
had
never
spoken
familiarly
to
any
woman
since
he
became
a
man
except
his
old
grandmother
it
was
well
known
that
the
counsel
of
the
aged
brings
luck
to
the
youth
in
warfare
and
love
antelope
arose
early
the
next
morning
and
without
speaking
to
any
one
he
made
a
ceremonious
toilet
he
put
on
his
finest
buckskin
shirt
and
a
handsome
robe
threw
a
beaded
quiver
over
his
shoulder
and
walked
directly
away
from
the
teepees
and
into
the
forest
he
did
not
know
why
nor
whither
the
sounds
of
the
camp
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
at
last
he
found
himself
alone
how
is
it
mused
the
young
man
that
i
have
hoped
to
become
a
leader
among
my
people
my
father
is
not
a
chief
and
none
of
my
ancestors
were
distinguished
in
war
i
know
well
that
if
i
desire
to
be
great
i
must
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
woman
s
company
until
i
have
made
my
reputation
i
must
not
boast
nor
exhibit
myself
on
my
first
success
the
spirits
do
not
visit
the
common
haunts
of
men
all
these
rules
i
have
thus
far
kept
and
i
must
not
now
yield
to
temptation
man
has
much
to
weaken
his
ambition
after
he
is
married
a
young
man
may
seek
opportunities
to
prove
his
worth
but
to
a
married
man
the
opportunity
must
come
to
try
him
he
acts
only
when
compelled
to
act
ah
i
must
flee
from
the
woman
besides
if
she
should
like
someone
else
better
i
should
be
humiliated
i
must
go
upon
a
long
i
shall
forget
her
at
this
point
his
revery
was
interrupted
by
the
joyous
laughter
of
two
young
women
the
melodious
laughter
of
the
sioux
maiden
stirred
the
very
soul
of
the
young
warrior
all
his
philosophy
deserted
him
and
he
stood
hesitating
looking
about
him
as
if
for
a
chance
of
escape
a
man
who
had
never
before
felt
the
magnetic
influence
of
woman
in
her
simplicity
and
childlike
purity
he
became
for
the
moment
incapable
of
speech
or
action
meanwhile
the
two
girls
were
wholly
unconscious
of
any
disturbing
presence
in
the
forest
they
were
telling
each
other
the
signals
that
each
had
received
in
the
dance
taluta
s
companion
had
stopped
at
the
first
raspberry
bushes
while
she
herself
passed
on
to
the
next
thicket
when
she
emerged
from
the
pines
into
an
opening
she
suddenly
beheld
antelope
in
his
suit
of
courtship
instantly
she
dropped
her
eyes
luckily
the
customs
of
courtship
among
the
sioux
allow
the
covering
of
one
s
head
with
the
blanket
in
this
attitude
the
young
man
made
a
signal
to
taluta
with
trembling
fingers
the
wild
red
man
s
wooing
was
natural
and
straightforward
there
was
no
circumspection
no
maneuvering
for
time
or
advantage
hot
words
of
love
burst
forth
from
the
young
warrior
s
lips
with
heavy
breathing
behind
the
folds
of
the
robe
with
which
he
sought
to
shield
his
embarrassment
for
once
the
spirits
are
guiding
my
fortunes
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
when
we
meet
thus
by
accident
that
i
should
speak
immediately
of
my
love
for
you
but
we
live
in
a
world
where
one
must
speak
when
the
opportunity
offers
i
have
thought
much
of
you
since
i
saw
you
at
the
maidens
feast
is
taluta
willing
to
become
the
wife
of
tatoka
the
moccasins
of
her
making
will
cause
his
feet
to
be
swift
in
pursuit
of
the
game
and
on
the
trail
of
the
enemy
i
beg
of
you
maiden
let
our
meeting
be
known
only
to
the
birds
of
the
air
while
you
consider
my
proposal
all
this
while
the
maiden
stood
demurely
at
his
side
playing
with
the
lariat
of
her
pony
in
her
brown
fine
hands
her
doeskin
gown
with
profuse
fringes
hung
gracefully
as
the
drooping
long
leaves
of
the
willow
and
her
two
heavy
braids
of
black
hair
mingled
with
strings
of
deers
hoofs
and
wampum
fell
upon
her
bosom
there
was
a
faint
glow
underneath
her
brown
skin
and
her
black
eyes
were
calm
and
soft
yet
full
of
native
fire
you
will
not
press
for
an
answer
now
she
gently
replied
without
looking
at
him
i
expected
to
see
no
one
here
and
your
words
have
taken
me
by
surprise
i
grant
your
last
request
the
birds
alone
can
indulge
in
gossip
about
our
meeting
unless
my
cousin
who
is
in
the
next
ravine
should
see
us
together
she
sprang
lightly
upon
the
back
of
her
pony
and
disappeared
among
the
scattered
pines
between
the
first
lovers
meeting
and
the
second
was
a
period
of
one
moon
this
was
wholly
the
fault
of
antelope
who
had
been
a
prey
to
indecision
and
painful
thoughts
half
regretting
his
impulsive
declaration
and
hoping
to
forget
his
pangs
in
the
chances
of
travel
and
war
he
had
finally
enlisted
in
the
number
of
those
who
were
to
go
with
the
crowhead
into
the
ute
country
as
was
the
custom
of
the
sioux
warriors
upon
the
eve
of
departure
the
young
men
consulted
their
spiritual
advisers
and
were
frequently
in
the
purifying
and
fasting
in
prayer
the
last
evening
had
come
and
antelope
was
on
the
way
to
the
top
of
the
hill
behind
the
camp
for
a
night
of
prayer
suddenly
in
the
he
came
full
upon
taluta
leading
her
pony
down
the
narrow
trail
she
had
never
looked
more
beautiful
to
the
youth
than
at
that
moment
ho
he
greeted
her
she
simply
smiled
shyly
it
is
long
since
we
met
he
ventured
i
have
concluded
that
you
do
not
care
to
hear
my
reply
retorted
the
girl
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
my
defense
but
i
hope
that
you
will
be
generous
i
have
suffered
much
you
will
understand
why
i
stand
far
from
you
he
added
gently
i
have
been
preparing
myself
to
go
upon
the
warpath
we
start
at
daylight
for
the
ute
country
every
day
for
ten
days
i
have
been
in
the
and
ten
nights
as
taluta
well
knew
a
young
warrior
under
these
circumstances
dared
not
approach
a
woman
not
even
his
own
wife
i
still
urge
you
to
be
my
wife
are
you
ready
to
give
me
your
answer
continued
antelope
my
answer
was
sent
to
you
by
your
grandmother
this
very
day
she
replied
softly
ah
tell
me
tell
me
pressed
the
youth
eagerly
all
is
well
fear
nothing
murmured
the
maiden
i
have
given
my
word
i
have
made
my
prayers
and
undergone
purification
i
must
not
withdraw
from
this
he
said
after
a
silence
but
i
know
that
i
shall
be
fortunate
my
grandmother
will
give
you
my
love
token
ah
kechuwa
dear
love
watch
the
big
star
every
night
i
will
watch
it
too
then
we
shall
both
be
watching
although
far
apart
our
spirits
will
be
the
moon
had
risen
above
the
hill
and
the
cold
light
discovered
the
two
who
stood
sadly
apart
their
hearts
hot
with
longing
reluctantly
yet
without
a
backward
look
or
farewell
gesture
the
warrior
went
on
up
the
hill
and
the
maiden
hurried
homeward
only
a
few
moments
before
she
had
been
happy
in
the
anticipation
of
making
her
lover
happy
the
truth
was
she
had
been
building
in
the
likeness
of
a
white
teepee
pitched
upon
a
virgin
prairie
all
alone
surrounded
by
mountains
tatoka
s
and
hunting
pony
were
picketed
near
by
and
there
she
saw
herself
preparing
the
simple
meal
for
him
but
now
he
has
clouded
her
dreams
by
this
untimely
departure
he
is
too
brave
his
life
will
be
a
short
one
she
said
to
herself
with
foreboding
for
a
few
hours
all
was
quiet
and
just
before
the
appearance
of
day
the
warriors
departure
was
made
known
by
their
farewell
songs
antelope
was
in
the
line
early
but
he
was
heavy
of
heart
for
he
knew
that
his
sweetheart
was
sorely
puzzled
and
disappointed
by
his
abrupt
departure
his
only
consolation
was
the
knowledge
that
he
had
in
his
bundle
a
pair
of
moccasins
made
by
her
hands
he
had
not
yet
seen
them
because
it
was
the
custom
not
to
open
any
farewell
gifts
until
the
first
camp
was
made
and
then
they
must
be
opened
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
young
men
it
brings
luck
to
the
they
said
he
would
have
preferred
to
keep
his
betrothal
secret
but
there
was
no
escaping
the
custom
all
the
were
burning
and
supper
had
been
eaten
when
the
herald
approached
every
group
and
announced
the
programme
for
the
evening
it
fell
to
antelope
to
open
his
bundle
first
loud
laughter
pealed
forth
when
the
reluctant
youth
brought
forth
a
superb
pair
of
moccasins
the
recognized
lovegift
at
such
times
the
warriors
jokes
were
unmerciful
for
it
was
considered
a
last
indulgence
in
jesting
perhaps
for
many
moons
the
recipient
was
well
known
to
be
a
novice
in
love
and
this
token
first
disclosed
the
fact
that
he
had
at
last
succumbed
to
the
allurements
of
woman
when
he
sang
his
he
was
obliged
to
name
the
giver
of
the
token
and
many
a
disappointed
suitor
was
astonished
to
hear
taluta
s
name
it
was
a
long
journey
to
the
ute
country
and
when
they
reached
it
there
was
a
stubbornly
contested
fight
both
sides
claimed
the
victory
and
both
lost
several
men
here
again
antelope
was
signally
favored
by
the
gods
of
war
he
counted
many
coups
or
blows
and
exhibited
his
bravery
again
and
again
in
the
charges
but
he
received
no
wound
on
the
return
journey
taluta
s
beautiful
face
was
constantly
before
him
he
was
so
impatient
to
see
her
that
he
hurried
on
in
advance
of
his
party
when
they
were
still
several
days
travel
from
the
sioux
camp
this
time
i
shall
join
in
all
the
dances
and
participate
in
the
rejoicings
for
she
will
surely
like
to
have
me
do
so
he
thought
to
himself
she
will
join
also
and
i
know
that
none
is
a
better
dancer
than
taluta
in
fancy
antelope
was
practicing
the
songs
of
victory
as
he
rode
alone
over
the
vast
wild
country
he
had
now
passed
wild
horse
creek
and
the
black
hills
lay
to
the
southeast
while
the
big
horn
range
loomed
up
to
the
north
in
gigantic
proportions
he
felt
himself
at
home
i
shall
now
be
a
man
indeed
i
shall
have
a
wife
he
said
aloud
at
last
he
reached
the
point
from
which
he
expected
to
view
the
distant
camp
alas
there
was
no
camp
there
only
a
solitary
teepee
gleamed
forth
upon
the
green
plain
which
was
almost
surrounded
by
a
quick
turn
of
the
river
of
deep
woods
the
teepee
appeared
very
white
a
peculiar
tingling
sensation
passed
through
his
frame
and
the
pony
whinnied
often
as
he
was
urged
forward
at
a
gallop
when
antelope
beheld
the
solitary
teepee
he
knew
instantly
what
it
was
it
was
a
grave
sometimes
a
new
white
lodge
was
pitched
thus
for
the
dead
who
lay
in
state
within
upon
a
couch
of
finest
skins
and
surrounded
by
his
choicest
possessions
antelope
s
excitement
increased
as
he
neared
the
teepee
which
was
protected
by
a
barricade
of
thick
brush
it
stood
alone
and
silent
in
the
midst
of
the
deserted
camp
he
kicked
the
sides
of
his
tired
horse
to
make
him
go
faster
at
last
he
jumped
from
the
saddle
and
ran
toward
the
door
there
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
at
the
thought
of
desecrating
a
grave
a
cold
terror
came
over
him
i
must
see
i
must
see
he
said
aloud
and
desperately
he
broke
through
the
thorny
fence
and
drew
aside
the
oval
swinging
door
ii
in
the
stately
white
teepee
seen
from
afar
both
grave
and
monument
there
lay
the
fair
body
of
taluta
the
bier
was
undisturbed
and
the
maiden
looked
beautiful
as
if
sleeping
dressed
in
her
robes
of
ceremony
and
surrounded
by
all
her
belongings
her
lover
looked
upon
her
still
face
and
cried
aloud
hey
hey
hey
alas
alas
if
i
had
known
of
this
while
in
the
ute
country
you
would
not
be
lonely
on
the
spirit
he
withdrew
and
laid
the
doorflap
reverently
back
in
its
place
how
long
he
stood
without
the
threshold
he
could
not
tell
he
stood
with
head
bowed
down
upon
his
breast
tearless
and
motionless
utterly
oblivious
to
everything
save
the
bier
of
his
beloved
his
charger
grazed
about
for
a
long
time
where
he
had
left
him
but
at
last
he
endeavored
by
a
low
whinny
to
attract
his
master
s
attention
and
antelope
awoke
from
his
trance
of
sorrow
the
sun
was
now
hovering
over
the
western
ridges
the
mourner
s
throat
was
parched
and
perspiration
rolled
down
his
cheeks
yet
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
strong
desire
to
look
upon
her
calm
sweet
face
once
more
he
kindled
a
small
fire
a
little
way
off
and
burned
some
cedar
berries
and
grass
then
he
fumigated
himself
thoroughly
to
dispel
the
human
atmosphere
so
that
the
spirit
might
not
be
offended
by
his
approach
for
he
greatly
desired
to
obtain
a
sign
from
her
spirit
he
had
removed
his
garments
and
stood
up
perfectly
nude
save
for
the
breechclout
his
long
hair
was
unbraided
and
hung
upon
his
shoulders
veiling
the
upper
half
of
his
splendid
body
thus
standing
the
lover
sang
a
dirge
of
his
own
making
the
words
were
something
like
this
ah
spirit
thy
flight
is
mysterious
while
the
clouds
are
stirred
by
our
wailing
and
our
tears
fall
faster
in
sorrow
while
the
cold
sweat
of
night
benumbs
us
thou
goest
alone
on
thy
journey
in
the
midst
of
the
shining
star
people
thou
goest
alone
on
thy
journey
thy
memory
shall
be
our
portion
until
death
we
must
watch
for
the
spirit
the
eyes
of
antelope
were
closed
while
he
chanted
the
dirge
he
sang
it
over
and
over
pausing
between
the
lines
and
straining
as
it
were
every
sense
lest
he
might
not
catch
the
rapt
whisper
of
her
spirit
but
only
the
distant
howls
of
coyotes
answered
him
his
body
became
cold
and
numb
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
at
last
his
knees
bent
under
him
and
he
sank
down
upon
the
ground
still
facing
the
teepee
unconsciousness
overtook
him
and
in
his
sleep
or
trance
the
voice
came
do
not
mourn
for
me
my
friend
come
into
my
teepee
and
eat
of
my
it
seemed
to
antelope
that
he
faltered
for
a
moment
then
he
entered
the
teepee
there
was
a
cheerful
fire
burning
in
the
center
a
basin
of
broiled
buffalo
meat
was
placed
opposite
the
couch
of
taluta
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
its
odor
was
delicious
to
him
yet
he
hesitated
to
eat
of
it
fear
not
kechuwa
my
darling
it
will
give
you
strength
said
the
voice
the
maid
was
natural
as
in
life
beautifully
attired
she
sat
up
on
her
bed
and
her
demeanor
was
cheerful
and
kind
the
young
man
ate
of
the
food
in
silence
and
without
looking
at
the
spirit
ho
kechuwa
he
said
to
her
when
returning
the
dish
according
to
the
custom
of
his
people
silently
the
two
sat
for
some
minutes
while
the
youth
gazed
into
the
burning
embers
be
of
good
heart
said
taluta
at
last
for
you
shall
meet
my
twin
spirit
she
will
love
you
as
i
do
and
you
will
love
her
as
you
love
me
this
was
our
covenant
before
we
came
into
this
the
conception
of
a
twin
spirit
was
familiar
to
the
sioux
ho
responded
the
warrior
with
dignity
and
all
seriousness
he
felt
a
great
awe
for
the
spirit
and
dared
not
lift
his
eyes
to
her
face
weep
no
more
kechuwa
weep
no
more
she
softly
added
and
the
next
moment
antelope
found
himself
outside
the
mysterious
teepee
his
limbs
were
stiff
and
cold
but
he
did
not
feel
faint
nor
hungry
having
filled
his
pipe
he
held
it
up
to
the
spirits
and
then
partook
of
the
smoke
and
thus
revived
he
slowly
and
reluctantly
left
the
sacred
spot
the
main
also
visited
the
old
camp
and
saw
the
solitary
teepee
grave
but
did
not
linger
there
they
continued
on
the
trail
of
the
caravan
until
they
reached
the
new
camping
ground
they
called
themselves
successful
although
they
had
left
several
of
their
number
on
the
field
their
triumph
songs
indicated
this
therefore
the
people
hurried
to
receive
the
news
and
to
learn
who
were
the
unfortunates
the
father
of
antelope
was
foremost
among
those
who
ran
to
meet
the
he
learned
that
his
son
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
fight
and
that
his
name
was
not
mentioned
among
the
brave
dead
and
where
then
is
he
he
asked
with
unconcealed
anxiety
he
left
us
three
days
ago
to
come
in
advance
they
replied
but
he
has
not
arrived
exclaimed
old
wezee
in
much
agitation
he
returned
to
his
teepee
where
he
consoled
himself
as
best
he
could
by
smoking
the
pipe
in
solitude
he
could
neither
sing
praises
nor
indulge
in
the
death
dirge
and
none
came
in
either
to
congratulate
or
mourn
with
him
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
hills
and
the
old
man
still
sat
gazing
into
the
burning
embers
when
he
heard
a
horse
s
footfall
at
the
door
of
his
lodge
ho
atay
father
came
the
welcome
call
mechinkshe
mechinkshe
my
son
my
son
he
replied
in
unrestrained
joy
old
wezee
now
stood
on
the
threshold
and
sang
the
praise
song
for
his
son
ending
with
a
warwhoop
such
as
he
had
not
indulged
in
since
he
was
quite
a
young
man
the
camp
was
once
more
alive
with
the
dances
and
the
dull
thud
of
the
indian
drum
was
continually
in
the
air
the
council
had
agreed
that
antelope
was
entitled
to
wear
a
of
eagles
feathers
he
was
accordingly
summoned
before
the
aboriginal
parliament
and
from
the
wise
men
of
the
tribe
he
received
his
degree
of
it
was
a
public
ceremony
the
great
pipe
was
held
up
for
him
to
take
the
smoke
of
high
honor
the
happiest
person
present
was
the
father
of
antelope
but
he
himself
remained
calm
and
unmoved
throughout
the
ceremony
he
is
a
strange
person
was
the
whisper
among
a
group
of
youths
who
were
watching
the
proceedings
with
envious
eyes
the
young
man
was
strangely
listless
and
depressed
in
spirit
his
old
grandmother
knew
why
but
none
of
the
others
understood
he
never
joined
in
the
village
festivities
while
the
rest
of
his
family
were
untiring
in
the
dances
and
old
wezee
was
at
the
height
of
his
happiness
it
was
a
crisp
october
morning
and
the
family
were
eating
their
breakfast
of
broiled
bison
meat
when
the
large
drum
at
the
council
lodge
was
struck
three
times
the
old
man
set
down
his
wooden
basin
ah
my
son
the
will
make
an
announcement
it
may
be
a
call
for
the
enlistment
of
warriors
i
am
sorry
he
said
and
paused
i
am
sorry
because
i
would
rather
no
went
out
at
present
i
am
getting
old
i
have
enjoyed
your
success
my
son
i
love
to
hear
the
people
speak
your
name
if
you
go
again
upon
the
i
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
join
in
the
celebrations
something
tells
me
that
you
will
not
return
young
braves
were
already
on
their
way
to
the
council
lodge
tatoka
looked
and
the
temptation
was
great
father
it
is
not
becoming
for
me
to
remain
at
home
when
others
go
he
said
at
last
ho
was
the
assent
uttered
by
the
father
with
a
deep
sigh
five
hundred
braves
have
enlisted
to
go
with
the
great
war
prophet
against
the
three
confederated
tribes
he
afterward
reported
at
home
with
an
air
of
elation
which
he
had
not
worn
for
some
moons
since
antelope
had
received
the
degree
of
his
father
had
spared
neither
time
nor
his
meager
means
in
his
behalf
he
had
bartered
his
most
cherished
possessions
for
several
eagles
that
were
brought
in
by
various
hunters
of
the
camp
and
with
his
own
hands
had
made
a
handsome
for
his
son
you
will
now
wear
a
for
the
first
time
and
you
are
the
first
of
our
family
who
has
earned
the
right
to
wear
one
for
many
generations
i
am
proud
of
you
my
son
he
said
as
he
presented
it
but
when
the
youth
replied
ho
ho
father
i
ought
to
be
a
brave
man
in
recognition
of
this
honor
he
again
sighed
heavily
it
is
that
i
feared
my
son
many
a
young
man
has
lost
his
life
for
vanity
and
love
of
display
the
evening
serenades
began
early
for
the
party
was
to
leave
at
once
in
groups
upon
their
favorite
ponies
the
warriors
rode
around
the
inner
circle
of
the
great
camp
singing
their
all
the
people
came
out
of
the
teepees
and
sitting
by
twos
and
threes
upon
the
ground
bedecked
with
savage
finery
they
watched
and
listened
the
pretty
wild
maidens
had
this
last
opportunity
given
them
to
look
upon
the
faces
of
their
sweethearts
whom
they
might
never
see
again
here
and
there
an
old
man
was
singing
the
gratitude
song
or
while
announcing
the
first
warpath
of
a
novice
for
such
an
announcement
meant
the
giving
of
many
presents
to
the
poor
and
aged
so
the
camp
was
filled
with
songs
of
joy
and
pride
in
the
departing
husbands
brothers
and
sons
as
soon
as
darkness
set
in
the
sound
of
the
rude
native
flute
was
added
to
the
celebration
this
is
the
lover
s
farewell
the
young
braves
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
their
finest
robes
each
sounded
the
plaintive
strains
near
the
teepee
of
the
beloved
the
playful
yodeling
of
many
voices
in
chorus
was
heard
at
the
close
of
each
song
at
midnight
the
army
of
five
hundred
the
flower
of
the
sioux
marched
against
their
ancient
enemy
antelope
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
he
had
his
to
display
before
the
enemy
he
was
now
regarded
as
one
of
the
foremost
warriors
of
his
band
and
might
probably
be
asked
to
perform
some
specially
hazardous
duty
so
that
he
was
fully
prepared
to
earn
further
distinction
in
five
days
the
sioux
were
encamped
within
a
day
s
travel
of
the
permanent
village
of
the
confederated
tribes
the
rees
mandans
and
gros
ventres
the
selected
two
men
antelope
and
eaglechild
to
scout
at
night
in
advance
of
the
main
force
it
was
thought
that
most
of
the
hunters
had
already
returned
to
their
winter
quarters
and
in
this
case
the
sioux
would
have
no
mean
enemy
to
face
on
the
other
hand
a
battle
was
promised
that
would
enlarge
their
important
traditions
the
two
made
their
way
as
rapidly
as
possible
toward
the
ancestral
home
of
their
enemies
it
was
a
night
perfectly
suited
to
what
they
had
to
do
for
the
moon
was
full
the
fleeting
clouds
hiding
it
from
time
to
time
and
casting
deceptive
shadows
when
they
had
come
within
a
short
distance
of
the
lodges
unperceived
they
lay
flat
for
a
long
time
and
studied
the
ways
of
the
young
men
in
every
particular
for
it
was
antelope
s
plan
to
enter
the
great
village
and
mingle
boldly
with
its
inhabitants
even
their
hoots
and
were
carefully
noted
so
that
they
might
be
able
to
imitate
them
there
were
several
entertainments
in
progress
in
different
parts
of
the
village
yet
it
was
apparent
that
the
greatest
vigilance
was
observed
the
lodges
of
poles
covered
with
earth
were
partly
underground
and
at
one
end
the
were
stabled
as
a
precaution
against
a
possible
surprise
at
the
moment
that
a
large
cloud
floated
over
the
moon
casting
a
shadow
large
enough
to
cover
the
entire
village
the
drum
in
one
of
the
principal
lodges
was
struck
in
quick
time
accompanied
by
boisterous
and
singing
the
two
scouts
adjusted
their
robes
about
them
in
the
fashion
of
the
strangers
and
walked
openly
in
that
direction
they
glanced
quickly
from
side
to
side
as
they
approached
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
so
they
came
up
with
other
young
men
and
peeped
through
the
chinks
in
the
earth
wigwam
it
was
a
great
gambling
party
among
the
guests
were
several
distinguished
warriors
and
each
at
an
opportune
time
would
rise
and
recount
his
great
deeds
in
warfare
against
the
sioux
the
strangers
could
read
their
gestures
and
antelope
was
once
or
twice
almost
on
the
point
of
stringing
his
bow
to
send
an
arrow
through
the
audacious
speaker
as
they
moved
about
the
village
taking
note
of
its
numbers
and
situation
and
waiting
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
without
exciting
suspicion
they
observed
some
of
the
younger
braves
standing
near
another
large
wigwam
and
one
or
two
even
peeped
within
moved
by
sudden
curiosity
antelope
followed
their
example
he
uttered
a
low
exclamation
and
at
once
withdrew
what
is
it
asked
his
companion
but
received
no
answer
it
was
evidently
the
home
of
a
chief
the
family
were
seated
within
at
their
usual
occupations
and
the
bright
light
of
the
central
fire
shone
full
upon
the
face
of
a
most
lovely
maiden
antelope
stood
apparently
motionless
but
he
was
trembling
under
his
robe
like
a
leaf
come
friend
there
is
another
large
cloud
almost
over
the
moon
we
must
move
away
under
its
concealing
shadow
urged
eaglechild
the
other
stood
still
as
if
undecided
but
at
last
he
approached
the
lodge
and
looked
in
a
second
time
there
sat
his
sweetheart
in
human
form
once
more
the
maiden
was
attired
in
a
doeskin
gown
set
with
elk
s
teeth
like
ivory
her
eyes
were
cast
down
demurely
over
her
embroidery
but
in
every
feature
she
was
the
living
counterpart
of
taluta
at
last
the
two
got
away
unobserved
and
hastened
toward
the
place
where
they
had
concealed
their
horses
but
here
antelope
sent
his
companion
on
in
advance
making
the
excuse
that
he
wished
to
study
further
the
best
position
from
which
to
make
the
attack
when
he
was
left
alone
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
to
decide
upon
a
plan
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
he
must
meet
the
ree
maiden
before
daylight
he
realized
the
extreme
hazard
of
the
attempt
but
he
also
recalled
what
he
had
been
told
by
the
spirit
of
taluta
and
the
supernatural
command
seemed
to
justify
him
even
in
going
thus
upon
the
eve
of
battle
to
meet
the
enemy
of
his
people
he
skirted
the
heavy
timber
and
retraced
his
steps
to
a
point
from
which
he
could
see
the
village
the
drum
of
the
gambling
party
had
ceased
with
the
shouts
and
laughter
of
the
players
apparently
the
village
was
lost
in
slumber
the
moon
had
set
and
without
pausing
he
advanced
to
the
home
of
the
girl
as
he
came
near
some
dogs
began
to
bark
but
he
silenced
them
after
the
manner
of
the
rees
and
they
obeyed
him
when
antelope
softly
raised
the
robe
that
hung
over
the
entrance
to
the
chief
s
lodge
he
saw
the
fire
smoldering
in
the
center
and
the
members
of
the
household
lying
in
their
respective
places
all
seemingly
in
a
deep
sleep
the
girl
lay
opposite
the
entrance
where
he
had
seen
her
seated
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
the
heart
of
the
sioux
beat
violently
and
he
glanced
nervously
to
left
and
right
there
was
neither
sound
nor
movement
then
he
pulled
his
robe
completely
over
his
head
after
the
fashion
of
a
ree
lover
and
softly
entered
the
wigwam
the
ree
maiden
having
industriously
worked
on
her
embroidery
until
far
into
the
night
had
retired
to
rest
in
her
dreams
the
twin
sister
came
to
her
of
whom
she
had
had
visions
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
especially
when
something
of
importance
was
about
to
happen
this
time
she
came
with
a
handsome
young
man
of
another
tribe
and
said
sister
i
bring
you
a
sioux
who
will
be
your
husband
the
dreamer
opened
her
eyes
to
behold
a
youth
bending
over
her
and
gently
pulling
her
robe
as
a
suitor
is
permitted
to
do
to
awaken
his
beloved
when
he
saw
that
she
was
awake
the
sioux
touched
his
breast
saying
in
a
whisper
tatoka
and
made
the
sign
for
antelope
this
pleased
the
ree
girl
for
her
own
brother
who
had
died
the
year
before
had
borne
that
name
she
immediately
sat
up
and
stirred
the
embers
into
a
light
blaze
then
she
took
hold
of
his
blanket
and
drew
it
from
his
face
and
there
she
seemed
to
see
the
very
features
of
the
man
of
her
vision
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
she
felt
the
force
of
love
stream
through
his
long
nervous
fingers
and
instinctively
knew
his
thoughts
in
her
turn
she
touched
her
breast
and
made
the
sign
for
shield
pronouncing
in
her
own
tongue
the
word
stasu
this
seemed
to
him
also
a
name
of
good
omen
and
in
the
sign
language
which
was
common
to
all
the
people
of
the
plains
he
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
vividly
her
dream
came
back
to
her
and
she
could
not
refuse
the
stranger
her
soul
already
responded
to
his
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
sat
silently
side
by
side
when
he
arose
and
beckoned
come
with
me
she
had
no
question
to
make
and
without
a
word
she
followed
him
from
her
father
s
lodge
and
out
into
the
forest
in
the
midst
of
his
ascending
fame
at
a
moment
when
opportunity
seemed
to
favor
his
ambition
the
brave
antelope
had
mysteriously
disappeared
his
companion
scout
returned
with
a
favorable
report
he
said
that
the
men
of
the
three
confederated
tribes
were
gambling
and
feasting
wholly
unconscious
of
danger
and
that
antelope
would
follow
him
with
a
further
report
upon
the
best
point
of
attack
the
red
warriors
impatiently
awaited
his
return
until
it
became
apparent
that
they
could
wait
no
longer
without
sacrificing
their
chance
of
success
when
the
attack
was
made
it
was
already
rather
late
the
sun
had
fairly
cleared
the
eastern
hills
and
most
of
the
men
were
outside
their
lodges
it
was
a
great
battle
again
and
again
the
sioux
were
repulsed
but
as
often
they
rallied
and
repeated
the
charge
until
sundown
when
they
effected
their
retreat
with
considerable
loss
had
antelope
returned
in
due
season
the
charge
would
have
been
made
before
dawn
while
the
people
were
yet
asleep
when
the
battle
was
over
the
rees
mandans
and
gros
ventres
gathered
their
dead
and
wounded
the
night
was
filled
with
mourning
soon
the
sad
news
was
heralded
throughout
the
camp
that
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
ree
chief
was
among
the
missing
it
was
supposed
that
she
must
have
been
captured
while
driving
her
ponies
to
water
in
the
early
morning
the
grief
for
her
loss
was
mingled
with
horror
because
of
a
fear
that
she
might
suffer
humiliation
at
the
hands
of
the
sioux
warriors
and
among
the
young
men
there
were
muttered
threats
that
the
sioux
would
pay
dearly
for
this
though
partially
successful
the
sioux
had
lost
many
of
their
bravest
warriors
and
none
could
tell
what
had
happened
to
antelope
he
who
had
been
believed
the
favorite
of
the
gods
of
war
it
was
suggested
by
some
envious
ones
that
perhaps
he
had
recognized
the
strongly
entrenched
position
of
the
three
tribes
and
believing
the
battle
would
be
a
disastrous
one
had
set
out
for
home
without
making
his
report
but
this
supposition
was
not
deemed
credible
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
was
entertained
that
he
had
reentered
the
village
was
detected
and
slain
and
therefore
the
enemy
was
on
the
lookout
when
the
attack
was
made
hay
hay
hay
mechinkshe
alas
alas
my
son
was
the
sorrowful
cry
with
which
his
old
father
received
the
news
his
head
fell
upon
his
breast
and
all
the
others
groaned
in
sympathy
the
sunset
sky
was
a
blanket
of
beautiful
painting
there
were
among
the
clouds
in
orange
and
scarlet
while
some
were
black
as
night
so
the
camp
fairly
glowed
in
celebration
of
its
heroes
yet
there
was
deep
grief
in
many
families
when
the
evening
meal
had
been
eaten
and
the
people
were
sitting
outside
their
lodges
a
tall
old
man
almost
nude
appeared
in
the
circle
riding
a
fine
horse
he
had
blackened
his
face
his
hair
was
cut
short
and
the
horse
also
had
been
deprived
of
his
flowing
mane
and
tail
both
were
in
deep
mourning
after
the
fashion
of
the
sioux
ho
ho
exclaimed
many
warriors
as
he
passed
them
singing
in
a
hoarse
guttural
voice
ugh
he
sings
a
remarked
one
yes
i
am
told
that
he
will
find
his
son
s
bones
or
leave
his
own
in
the
country
of
the
enemy
the
rain
had
fallen
incessantly
for
two
days
the
fleeing
lovers
had
reached
this
lonely
mountain
valley
of
the
big
horn
region
on
the
night
that
the
cold
fall
rains
set
in
and
antelope
had
hurriedly
constructed
an
arbor
house
or
rude
shelter
of
pine
and
cedar
boughs
it
was
enough
there
they
sat
man
and
wife
in
their
first
home
of
living
green
the
cheerful
fire
was
burning
in
the
center
and
the
happy
smoke
went
straight
up
among
the
tall
pines
there
was
no
human
eye
to
gaze
upon
them
to
embarrass
not
even
a
common
language
in
which
to
express
their
love
for
one
another
their
marriage
they
believed
was
made
by
a
spirit
and
it
was
holy
in
their
minds
each
had
cast
away
his
people
and
his
all
for
the
sake
of
this
emotion
which
had
suddenly
overtaken
them
both
with
overwhelming
force
and
the
warrior
s
ambition
had
disappeared
before
it
like
a
morning
mist
before
the
sun
to
them
a
new
life
was
just
beginning
and
they
had
all
but
forgotten
the
existence
of
any
world
save
this
the
young
bride
was
enshrined
in
a
bower
of
spicy
fragrance
and
her
face
shone
whenever
her
eyes
met
those
of
her
husband
this
is
as
i
would
have
it
kechuwa
darling
exclaimed
the
sioux
in
his
own
language
she
simply
responded
with
a
childlike
smile
although
she
did
not
understand
his
words
she
read
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
only
happy
and
loving
thoughts
the
ree
girl
had
prepared
a
broiled
bison
steak
and
her
husband
was
keeping
the
fire
well
fed
with
dry
fagots
the
odor
of
the
buming
fat
was
delicious
and
the
gentle
patter
of
the
rain
made
a
weird
music
outside
their
wigwam
as
soon
as
her
husband
had
left
her
alone
for
he
must
go
to
water
the
ponies
and
conceal
them
at
a
distance
stasu
came
out
to
collect
more
wood
instinctively
she
looked
all
about
her
huge
mountains
towered
skyward
clad
in
pines
the
narrow
valley
in
which
she
was
wound
its
way
between
them
and
on
every
side
there
was
heavy
forest
she
stood
silent
and
awed
scarcely
able
to
realize
that
she
had
begun
her
new
life
absolutely
alone
with
no
other
woman
to
advise
or
congratulate
her
and
visited
only
by
the
birds
of
the
air
yet
all
the
world
to
her
just
now
was
antelope
no
other
woman
could
smile
on
him
he
could
not
talk
to
any
one
but
her
the
evening
drum
at
the
council
lodge
could
not
summon
him
away
from
her
and
she
was
well
content
when
the
young
wife
had
done
everything
she
could
think
of
in
preparation
for
her
husband
s
return
including
the
making
of
several
basins
and
pails
for
water
the
rain
had
quite
ceased
so
she
spread
her
robe
just
outside
the
lodge
and
took
up
her
in
which
she
had
several
pairs
of
already
beaded
while
she
bent
over
her
work
getting
up
from
time
to
time
to
turn
the
roast
which
she
had
impaled
upon
a
sharp
stick
above
the
glowing
coals
the
bride
had
a
stream
of
shy
callers
of
the
little
people
of
the
woods
she
sat
very
still
so
as
not
to
startle
them
and
there
is
much
curiosity
among
these
people
concerning
a
stranger
presently
she
was
startled
by
a
footfall
not
unlike
that
of
a
man
she
had
not
been
married
long
enough
to
know
the
sound
of
her
husband
s
step
and
she
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
and
fear
alternately
it
might
be
he
and
it
might
be
a
stranger
she
was
loath
to
look
up
but
at
last
gave
a
furtive
glance
and
met
squarely
the
eyes
of
a
large
grizzly
bear
who
was
seated
upon
his
haunches
not
far
away
stasu
was
surprised
but
she
showed
no
fear
and
fearlessness
is
the
best
shield
against
wild
animals
in
a
moment
she
got
up
unconcernedly
and
threw
a
large
piece
of
meat
to
the
stranger
take
of
my
wedding
feast
o
great
bear
she
addressed
him
and
be
good
to
me
to
bless
my
first
teepee
o
be
kind
and
recognize
my
brave
act
in
taking
for
my
husband
one
of
the
warriors
of
the
sioux
the
ancient
enemy
of
my
people
i
have
accepted
a
husband
of
a
language
other
than
mine
and
am
come
to
live
among
you
as
your
neighbor
i
offer
you
my
friendship
the
bear
s
only
answer
to
her
prayer
was
a
low
growl
but
having
eaten
the
meat
he
turned
and
clumsily
departed
in
the
meantime
antelope
had
set
himself
to
master
the
geography
of
that
region
to
study
the
outlook
for
game
and
ascertain
the
best
approaches
to
their
secret
home
it
was
already
settled
in
his
mind
that
he
could
never
return
either
to
his
wife
s
people
or
to
his
own
his
would
not
forgive
his
desertion
and
the
rees
could
not
be
expected
to
welcome
as
a
kinsman
one
of
the
foremost
of
their
ancient
foes
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
remain
in
seclusion
and
let
them
say
what
they
would
of
him
he
had
loved
the
ree
maiden
from
the
first
moment
he
beheld
her
by
the
light
of
the
blazing
embers
and
that
love
must
satisfy
him
it
was
well
that
he
had
never
cared
much
for
company
but
had
spent
many
of
his
young
days
in
solitude
and
fasting
it
did
not
seem
at
all
strange
to
him
that
he
had
been
forced
to
retreat
into
an
unknown
and
wild
country
with
a
woman
whom
he
saw
in
the
evening
for
the
first
time
and
fled
with
as
his
own
wife
before
sunrise
by
the
afternoon
he
had
thoroughly
informed
himself
upon
the
nature
of
the
surrounding
country
everything
on
the
face
of
the
map
was
surveyed
and
charted
in
his
mind
in
accordance
with
his
habits
and
training
this
done
he
turned
toward
his
secret
dwelling
as
he
walked
rapidly
and
noiselessly
through
the
hidden
valleys
and
along
the
singing
streams
he
noticed
fresh
signs
of
the
deer
elk
and
other
wild
tribes
among
whom
he
had
chosen
to
abide
they
shall
be
my
people
he
said
to
himself
behind
a
group
of
cedars
he
paused
to
reconnoiter
and
saw
the
wigwam
like
a
giant
plant
each
row
of
boughs
overlapping
the
preceding
circular
row
like
the
scales
of
a
fish
stasu
was
sitting
before
it
upon
a
buffalorobe
attired
in
her
best
doeskin
gown
her
delicate
oval
face
was
touched
with
red
paint
and
her
slender
brown
hands
were
occupied
with
a
moccasin
meant
for
him
to
wear
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
was
a
mortal
woman
that
he
saw
before
him
in
broad
day
the
pride
of
no
man
s
trail
for
that
is
what
the
crow
indians
call
that
valley
ho
ho
kechuwa
he
exclaimed
as
he
approached
her
and
her
heart
leaped
in
recognition
of
the
magnetic
words
of
love
it
is
good
that
we
are
alone
i
shall
never
want
to
go
back
to
my
people
so
long
as
i
have
you
i
can
dwell
here
with
you
forever
unless
you
should
think
otherwise
she
exclaimed
in
her
own
tongue
accompanied
by
graphic
signs
ho
i
think
of
nothing
else
i
can
see
in
every
creature
only
friendly
ways
and
good
feeling
we
can
live
alone
here
happily
unless
you
should
feel
differently
he
replied
in
his
own
language
with
the
signs
so
that
his
bride
understood
him
the
environment
was
just
what
it
should
be
when
two
people
are
united
in
marriage
the
wedding
music
was
played
by
nature
and
trees
brooks
and
the
birds
of
the
air
contributed
their
peculiar
strains
to
a
great
harmony
all
of
the
people
on
no
man
s
trail
were
polite
and
understood
the
reserves
of
love
these
two
had
yielded
to
a
simple
and
natural
impulse
but
its
only
justification
to
their
minds
was
the
mysterious
leading
of
the
twin
spirit
that
was
the
sum
total
of
their
excuse
and
it
was
enough
before
the
rigor
of
winter
had
set
in
tatoka
brought
to
his
bride
many
buffalo
skins
she
was
thoroughly
schooled
in
the
arts
of
savage
womanhood
in
fact
every
indian
maid
was
trained
with
this
thought
in
view
that
she
should
become
a
beautiful
strong
skillful
wife
and
mother
the
mother
of
a
noble
race
of
warriors
in
a
short
time
within
that
green
and
enclosure
there
smiled
a
little
wild
paradise
hard
by
the
wigwam
there
stood
a
new
white
teepee
tanned
cut
sewed
and
pitched
by
the
hands
of
stasu
away
in
the
woods
down
by
the
rushing
brook
was
her
tannery
and
not
far
away
in
a
sunny
open
spot
she
prepared
her
meats
for
winter
use
her
kitchen
was
a
stone
fireplace
in
a
shady
spot
and
her
parlor
was
the
lodge
of
evergreen
overhung
on
two
sides
by
inaccessible
ledges
and
bounded
on
the
other
two
by
the
sparkling
stream
it
was
a
secret
place
and
yet
a
citadel
a
silent
place
and
yet
not
lonely
the
winter
was
cold
and
long
but
the
pair
were
happy
in
one
another
s
company
and
accepted
their
strange
lot
as
one
that
was
chosen
for
them
by
the
spirits
stasu
had
insisted
upon
her
husband
speaking
to
her
in
his
own
language
that
she
might
learn
it
quickly
in
a
little
while
she
was
able
to
converse
with
him
and
when
she
had
acquired
his
language
she
taught
him
hers
while
antelope
was
occupied
with
hunting
and
exploring
the
country
always
keeping
in
mind
the
danger
of
discovery
by
some
wandering
scout
or
hunter
his
wife
grew
well
acquainted
with
the
wild
inhabitants
of
no
man
s
trail
these
people
are
as
full
of
curiosity
as
man
and
as
the
sioux
never
hunted
near
his
home
they
were
entirely
fearless
many
came
to
the
door
of
stasu
s
lodge
and
she
was
not
afraid
but
offered
them
food
and
spoke
to
them
kindly
all
animals
judge
by
signs
and
are
quick
in
reading
tones
and
gestures
so
that
the
ree
girl
soon
had
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
after
the
indian
fashion
among
the
wolves
and
bears
that
came
oftenest
for
food
her
husband
in
the
field
had
also
his
and
friends
when
he
killed
the
buffalo
he
always
left
enough
meat
for
the
wolves
the
eagles
and
the
ravens
to
feast
upon
and
these
watched
for
the
coming
of
the
lonely
wild
man
more
than
once
they
told
him
by
their
actions
of
the
presence
of
a
distant
campfire
but
in
each
instance
it
proved
to
be
a
small
which
had
passed
below
them
on
the
trail
again
it
was
summer
never
had
the
mountains
looked
grander
or
more
mysterious
to
the
eyes
of
the
two
the
valley
was
full
of
the
music
and
happiness
of
the
winged
summer
people
the
trees
wore
their
summer
attire
and
the
meadow
its
green
blanket
there
were
many
homes
made
happy
by
the
coming
of
little
people
everywhere
but
no
pair
was
happier
than
stasu
and
her
husband
when
one
morning
they
saw
their
little
brave
lying
wrapped
in
soft
deerskins
and
heard
for
the
first
time
his
plaintive
voice
that
morning
when
antelope
set
out
on
the
hunt
he
stopped
at
the
stream
and
looked
at
himself
seriously
to
see
whether
he
had
changed
since
the
day
before
he
must
now
appear
much
graver
he
said
to
himself
because
he
is
the
father
of
a
new
man
in
spite
of
himself
his
thoughts
were
with
his
own
people
and
he
wondered
what
his
old
grandmother
would
have
said
to
his
child
he
looked
away
off
toward
the
black
hills
to
the
sioux
country
and
in
his
heart
he
said
i
am
a
coward
the
boy
grew
naturally
and
never
felt
the
lack
of
playmates
and
companions
for
his
mother
was
ingenious
in
devising
plays
for
him
and
in
winning
for
him
the
confidence
and
kindness
of
the
animal
friends
he
was
the
young
chief
and
the
hero
of
no
man
s
trail
the
bears
and
wolves
were
his
warriors
the
buffalo
and
elk
the
hostile
tribes
upon
whom
he
went
to
war
small
as
he
was
he
soon
preferred
to
roam
alone
in
the
woods
his
parents
were
often
anxious
but
on
the
other
hand
they
entertained
the
hope
that
he
would
some
day
be
wakan
a
mysterious
or
supernatural
man
for
he
was
getting
power
from
his
wild
companions
and
from
the
silent
forces
of
nature
one
day
when
he
was
about
five
years
old
he
gave
a
dance
for
his
wild
pets
upon
the
little
plateau
which
was
still
their
home
he
had
clothed
mato
the
bear
in
one
of
his
father
s
suits
as
a
great
waho
the
wolf
was
painted
up
as
a
brave
and
the
young
buffalo
calf
was
attired
in
one
of
his
mother
s
gowns
the
boy
acted
as
chief
and
master
of
ceremonies
the
savage
mother
watched
him
with
undisguised
pride
mingled
with
sorrow
tears
coursed
down
her
dusky
cheeks
although
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
the
strange
performance
when
the
play
was
ended
and
she
had
served
the
feast
at
its
close
stasu
seemed
lost
in
thought
he
should
not
live
in
this
way
she
was
saying
to
herself
he
should
know
the
traditions
and
great
deeds
of
my
people
surely
his
grandfather
would
be
proud
of
the
boy
that
evening
while
the
boy
slept
and
mato
lay
outside
the
lodge
eagerly
listening
and
sniffing
the
night
air
the
parents
sat
silent
and
ill
at
ease
after
a
long
time
stasu
spoke
her
mind
my
husband
you
ask
me
why
i
am
sad
it
is
because
i
think
that
the
great
mystery
will
be
displeased
if
we
keep
this
little
boy
forever
in
the
wilderness
it
is
wrong
to
allow
him
to
grow
up
among
wild
animals
and
if
sickness
or
accident
should
deprive
him
of
his
father
and
mother
our
spirits
would
never
rest
because
we
had
left
him
alone
i
have
decided
to
ask
you
to
take
us
back
either
to
your
people
or
to
my
people
we
must
sacrifice
our
pride
or
if
needs
be
our
lives
for
his
life
and
happiness
this
speech
of
stasu
s
was
a
surprise
to
her
husband
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
ground
as
he
listened
and
his
face
assumed
the
proverbial
stoical
aspect
yet
in
it
there
was
not
lacking
a
certain
nobleness
at
last
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
hers
and
said
you
have
spoken
wise
words
and
it
shall
be
as
you
have
said
we
shall
return
to
your
people
if
i
am
to
die
at
the
hands
of
the
ancient
enemy
of
the
sioux
i
shall
die
because
of
my
love
for
you
and
for
our
child
but
i
can
not
go
back
to
my
own
people
to
be
ridiculed
by
unworthy
young
men
for
yielding
to
love
of
a
ree
maiden
there
was
much
feeling
behind
these
words
of
antelope
the
rigid
customs
of
his
people
are
almost
a
religion
and
there
is
one
thing
above
all
else
which
a
sioux
can
not
bear
that
is
the
ridicule
of
his
yes
he
can
endure
severe
punishment
or
even
death
at
the
hands
of
the
enemy
rather
than
a
single
laugh
of
derision
from
a
sioux
in
a
few
days
the
household
articles
were
packed
and
the
three
sadly
turned
their
backs
upon
their
home
stasu
and
her
husband
were
very
silent
as
they
traveled
slowly
along
when
they
reached
the
hill
called
and
she
saw
from
its
summit
the
country
of
her
people
lying
below
her
she
cried
aloud
weeping
happy
tears
antelope
sat
near
by
with
bowed
head
silently
smoking
finally
on
the
fifth
day
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
great
permanent
village
of
the
three
tribes
they
saw
the
earth
lodges
as
of
old
thickly
clustered
along
the
flats
of
the
missouri
among
their
rustling
antelope
stopped
i
think
you
had
better
give
me
something
to
eat
woman
he
said
smiling
it
was
the
sioux
way
of
saying
let
me
have
my
last
meal
after
they
had
eaten
stasu
opened
her
buckskin
bags
and
gave
her
husband
his
finest
suit
he
dressed
himself
carefully
in
the
fashion
of
his
tribe
putting
on
all
the
feathers
to
which
he
was
entitled
as
a
warrior
the
boy
also
was
decked
out
in
gala
attire
and
stasu
the
matron
had
never
looked
more
beautiful
in
her
gown
of
ceremony
with
the
decoration
of
elks
teeth
the
same
that
she
had
worn
on
the
evening
of
her
disappearance
as
she
dressed
herself
the
unwelcome
thought
forced
itself
upon
her
what
if
my
love
is
killed
by
my
own
countrymen
in
their
frenzy
this
beautiful
gown
must
then
give
place
to
a
poor
one
and
this
hair
will
be
cut
short
for
such
is
the
mourning
of
the
widow
among
her
people
the
three
rode
openly
down
the
long
slope
and
were
instantly
discovered
by
the
people
of
the
village
soon
the
plain
was
black
with
the
approaching
riders
stasu
had
begged
her
husband
to
remain
behind
while
she
went
on
alone
with
the
boy
to
obtain
forgiveness
but
he
sternly
refused
and
continued
in
advance
when
the
foremost
ree
warriors
came
within
they
began
to
shoot
to
which
he
paid
no
attention
but
the
child
screamed
with
terror
and
stasu
cried
out
in
her
own
tongue
do
not
shoot
i
am
the
daughter
of
your
chief
one
of
them
returned
the
reply
she
is
killed
by
the
sioux
but
when
the
leaders
saw
her
plainly
they
were
astounded
for
a
time
there
was
great
confusion
some
held
that
they
should
all
die
for
the
woman
had
been
guilty
of
treason
to
her
people
and
even
now
she
might
be
playing
a
trick
upon
them
who
could
say
that
behind
that
hill
there
was
not
a
sioux
no
no
replied
others
they
are
in
our
power
let
them
tell
their
story
stasu
told
it
simply
and
said
in
conclusion
this
man
one
of
the
bravest
and
most
honorable
men
of
his
tribe
deserted
on
the
night
of
the
attack
and
all
because
he
loved
a
ree
maiden
he
now
comes
to
be
your
who
will
fight
henceforth
for
you
and
with
you
even
if
it
be
against
his
own
people
he
does
not
beg
for
mercy
he
can
dare
anything
but
i
am
a
woman
my
heart
is
soft
i
ask
for
the
lives
of
my
husband
and
my
son
who
is
the
grandson
of
your
chief
he
is
a
coward
who
touches
this
man
exclaimed
the
leader
and
a
thunder
of
warwhoops
went
up
in
approval
of
his
words
the
warriors
formed
themselves
in
two
great
columns
riding
twenty
abreast
behind
and
in
front
of
the
strangers
the
old
chief
came
out
to
meet
them
and
took
his
s
hand
thus
they
entered
the
village
in
battle
array
but
with
hearts
touched
with
wonder
and
great
gladness
discharging
their
arrows
upward
in
clouds
and
singing
ii
the
madness
of
bald
eagle
it
was
many
years
ago
when
i
was
only
a
child
began
white
ghost
the
patriarchal
old
chief
of
the
yanktonnais
sioux
that
our
band
was
engaged
in
a
desperate
battle
with
the
rees
and
mandans
the
cause
of
the
fight
was
a
peculiar
one
i
will
tell
you
about
and
he
laid
aside
his
longstemmed
pipe
and
settled
himself
to
the
recital
at
that
time
the
yanktonnais
numbered
a
little
over
forty
families
we
were
nicknamed
by
the
other
bands
shunkikcheka
or
domestic
dogs
because
of
our
owning
large
numbers
of
these
animals
my
father
was
the
head
chief
our
favorite
wintering
place
was
a
timbered
tract
near
the
mouth
of
the
grand
river
and
it
was
here
that
we
met
the
blackfoot
sioux
in
the
fall
hunt
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
our
camp
was
the
permanent
village
of
the
rees
and
mandans
whose
houses
were
of
dirt
and
partly
underground
for
a
hundred
years
before
this
time
they
had
planted
large
gardens
and
we
were
accustomed
to
buy
of
them
corn
beans
and
pumpkins
from
time
to
time
our
people
had
made
treaties
of
peace
with
them
each
family
of
the
rees
had
one
or
two
buffalo
boats
not
round
as
the
sioux
made
them
but
two
or
three
skins
long
in
these
boats
they
brought
quantities
of
dried
beans
and
other
vegetables
to
trade
with
us
for
jerked
buffalo
meat
it
was
a
great
gathering
and
a
time
of
general
festivity
and
hospitality
the
sioux
young
men
were
courting
the
ree
girls
and
the
ree
braves
were
courting
our
girls
while
the
old
people
bartered
their
produce
all
day
the
river
was
alive
with
canoes
and
its
banks
rang
with
the
laughter
of
the
youths
and
maidens
my
father
s
younger
brother
whose
name
was
big
whip
had
a
close
friend
a
young
man
who
ever
after
the
event
of
which
i
am
about
to
tell
you
was
known
as
bald
eagle
they
were
both
daring
young
men
and
very
ambitious
for
distinction
they
had
been
following
the
ree
girls
to
their
canoes
as
they
returned
to
their
homes
in
the
evening
big
whip
and
his
friend
stood
upon
the
river
bank
at
sunset
one
with
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
upon
his
back
while
the
other
carried
a
gun
under
his
blanket
nearly
all
the
people
of
the
other
village
had
crossed
the
river
and
the
chief
of
the
rees
whose
name
was
bald
eagle
went
home
with
his
wife
last
of
all
it
was
about
dusk
as
they
entered
their
bullhide
boat
and
the
two
sioux
stood
there
looking
at
them
suddenly
big
whip
exclaimed
friend
let
us
kill
the
chief
i
dare
you
to
kill
and
scalp
him
his
friend
replied
it
shall
be
as
you
say
i
will
stand
by
you
in
all
things
i
am
willing
to
die
with
accordingly
bald
eagle
pulled
out
his
gun
and
shot
the
ree
dead
from
that
day
he
took
his
name
the
old
man
fell
backward
into
his
boat
and
the
old
woman
screamed
and
wept
as
she
rowed
him
across
the
river
the
other
young
man
shot
an
arrow
or
two
at
the
wife
but
she
continued
to
row
until
she
reached
the
other
bank
there
was
great
excitement
on
both
sides
of
the
river
as
soon
as
the
people
saw
what
had
happened
there
were
two
camps
of
sioux
the
blackfoot
sioux
and
the
yanktonnais
or
our
people
of
course
the
mandans
and
rees
greatly
outnumbered
us
their
camp
must
have
numbered
two
or
three
thousand
which
was
more
than
we
had
in
our
combined
camps
there
was
a
sioux
whose
name
was
black
shield
who
had
intermarried
among
the
rees
he
came
down
to
the
opposite
bank
of
the
missouri
and
shouted
to
us
of
which
one
of
your
bands
is
the
man
who
killed
bald
eagle
one
of
the
blackfoot
sioux
replied
it
is
a
man
of
the
yanktonnais
sioux
who
killed
bald
then
he
said
the
rees
wish
to
do
battle
with
them
you
had
better
withdraw
from
their
accordingly
the
blackfeet
retired
about
a
mile
from
us
upon
the
bluffs
and
pitched
their
tents
while
the
yanktonnais
remained
on
the
flats
the
two
bands
had
been
great
rivals
in
courage
and
the
art
of
war
so
we
did
not
ask
for
help
from
our
kinsfolk
but
during
the
night
we
dug
trenches
about
the
camp
the
inner
one
for
the
women
and
children
and
the
outer
one
for
the
men
to
stay
in
and
do
battle
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
the
enemy
landed
and
approached
our
camp
in
great
numbers
some
of
their
women
and
old
men
came
also
and
sat
upon
the
bluffs
to
watch
the
fight
and
to
carry
off
their
dead
and
wounded
the
blackfeet
likewise
were
watching
the
battle
from
the
bluffs
and
just
before
the
fight
began
one
blackfoot
came
in
with
his
wife
and
joined
us
his
name
was
red
dog
s
track
but
from
that
day
he
was
called
his
wife
was
a
yanktonnais
and
he
had
said
to
her
if
i
don
t
join
your
tribe
my
will
call
me
a
the
sioux
were
well
entrenched
and
well
armed
with
guns
and
arrows
and
their
aim
was
deadly
so
that
the
rees
crawled
up
gradually
and
took
every
opportunity
to
pick
off
any
sioux
who
ventured
to
show
his
head
above
the
trenches
in
like
manner
every
ree
who
exposed
himself
was
sure
to
die
up
to
this
time
no
one
had
seen
the
two
men
who
made
all
the
trouble
there
was
a
natural
hollow
in
the
bank
concealed
by
buffalo
berry
bushes
very
near
where
they
stood
when
bald
eagle
shot
the
ree
friend
said
big
whip
it
is
likely
that
our
own
people
will
punish
us
for
this
deed
they
will
pursue
and
kill
us
wherever
they
find
us
they
have
the
right
to
do
this
the
best
thing
is
to
drop
into
this
washout
and
remain
there
until
they
cease
to
look
for
they
did
so
and
remained
hidden
during
the
night
but
after
the
fight
began
big
whip
said
again
friend
we
are
the
cause
of
the
deaths
of
many
brave
men
this
day
we
committed
the
act
to
show
our
bravery
we
dared
each
other
to
do
it
it
will
now
become
us
as
warriors
to
join
our
they
both
stripped
and
taking
their
weapons
in
hand
ran
toward
the
camp
they
had
to
pass
directly
through
the
enemy
s
lines
but
they
were
not
recognized
till
they
had
fairly
passed
them
then
they
were
between
two
fires
when
they
had
almost
reached
the
entrenchment
they
faced
about
and
fired
at
the
rees
jumping
about
incessantly
to
avoid
being
hit
as
is
the
indian
fashion
bullets
and
arrows
were
flying
all
about
them
like
hail
but
at
last
they
dropped
back
unhurt
into
the
sioux
trenches
thus
the
two
men
saved
their
reputation
for
bravery
and
their
people
never
openly
reproached
them
for
the
events
of
that
day
young
men
are
often
rash
but
it
is
not
well
to
reprove
one
for
a
brave
deed
lest
he
become
a
coward
many
were
killed
but
more
of
the
rees
than
of
our
band
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
there
came
a
cold
rain
it
was
in
the
fall
of
the
year
the
were
wet
and
the
guns
were
only
you
know
when
the
flint
becomes
wet
it
is
useless
and
it
looked
as
if
the
fight
must
be
with
knives
but
the
rees
were
much
disheartened
they
had
lost
many
the
women
were
all
the
time
carrying
off
the
wounded
and
there
were
the
blackfoot
sioux
watching
them
from
the
hills
they
turned
and
fled
toward
the
river
the
sioux
followed
like
crazy
wolves
tomahawking
the
tired
and
slow
ones
many
were
killed
at
the
boats
and
some
of
the
boats
were
punctured
with
shot
and
sank
some
carried
a
load
of
sioux
arrows
back
across
the
river
that
was
the
greatest
battle
ever
fought
by
our
band
the
old
man
concluded
with
a
deep
sigh
of
mingled
satisfaction
and
regret
iii
the
singing
spirit
i
ho
my
steed
we
must
climb
one
more
hill
my
reputation
depends
upon
my
report
anookasan
addressed
his
pony
as
if
he
were
a
human
companion
urged
on
like
himself
by
human
need
and
human
ambition
and
yet
in
his
heart
he
had
very
little
hope
of
sighting
any
buffalo
in
that
region
at
just
that
time
of
the
year
the
yankton
sioux
were
ordinarily
the
most
of
their
people
in
selecting
a
winter
camp
but
this
year
the
late
fall
had
caught
them
rather
far
east
of
the
missouri
bottoms
their
favorite
the
upper
jim
river
called
by
the
sioux
the
river
of
gray
woods
was
usually
bare
of
large
game
at
that
season
their
store
of
jerked
buffalo
meat
did
not
hold
out
as
they
had
hoped
and
by
march
it
became
an
urgent
necessity
to
send
out
scouts
for
buffalo
the
old
men
at
the
tiyo
teepee
council
lodge
held
a
long
council
it
was
decided
to
select
ten
of
their
bravest
and
hardiest
young
men
to
explore
the
country
within
three
days
journey
of
their
camp
anookasan
woo
woo
thus
the
ten
men
were
summoned
to
the
council
lodge
early
in
the
evening
to
receive
their
commission
anookasan
was
the
first
called
and
first
to
cross
the
circle
of
the
teepees
a
young
man
of
some
thirty
years
of
the
original
native
type
his
massive
form
was
wrapped
in
a
fine
buffalo
robe
with
the
hair
inside
he
wore
a
stately
eagle
feather
in
his
but
no
paint
about
his
face
as
he
entered
the
lodge
all
the
inmates
greeted
him
with
marked
respect
and
he
was
given
the
place
of
honor
when
all
were
seated
the
great
drum
was
struck
and
a
song
sung
by
four
men
this
was
the
prelude
to
a
peculiar
ceremony
a
large
red
pipe
which
had
been
filled
and
laid
carefully
upon
the
central
hearth
was
now
taken
up
by
an
old
man
whose
face
was
painted
red
first
he
held
it
to
the
ground
with
the
words
great
mother
partake
of
this
then
he
held
it
toward
the
sky
saying
great
father
smoke
this
finally
he
lighted
it
took
four
puffs
pointing
it
to
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
in
turn
and
lastly
presented
it
to
anookasan
this
was
the
oath
of
office
administered
by
the
chief
of
the
council
lodge
the
other
nine
were
similarly
commissioned
and
all
accepted
the
appointment
it
was
no
light
task
that
was
thus
religiously
enjoined
upon
these
ten
men
it
meant
at
the
least
several
days
and
nights
of
wandering
in
search
of
signs
of
the
wily
buffalo
it
was
a
public
duty
and
a
personal
one
as
well
one
that
must
involve
untold
hardship
and
if
overtaken
by
storm
the
messengers
were
in
peril
of
death
anookasan
returned
to
his
teepee
with
some
misgiving
his
old
charger
which
had
so
often
carried
him
to
victory
was
not
so
strong
as
he
had
been
in
his
prime
as
his
master
approached
the
lodge
the
old
horse
welcomed
him
with
a
gentle
whinny
he
was
always
tethered
near
by
ready
for
any
emergency
ah
wakan
we
are
once
more
called
upon
to
do
duty
we
shall
set
out
before
as
he
spoke
he
pushed
nearer
a
few
strips
of
the
poplar
bark
which
was
oats
to
the
indian
pony
of
the
olden
time
anookasan
had
his
extra
pair
of
buffaloskin
moccasins
with
the
hair
inside
and
his
scanty
provision
of
dried
meat
neatly
done
up
in
a
small
packet
and
fastened
to
his
saddle
with
his
companions
he
started
northward
up
the
river
of
the
gray
woods
five
on
the
east
side
and
a
like
number
on
the
west
the
party
had
separated
each
morning
so
as
to
cover
as
much
ground
as
possible
having
agreed
to
return
at
night
to
the
river
it
was
now
the
third
day
their
food
was
all
but
gone
their
steeds
much
worn
and
the
signs
seemed
to
indicate
a
storm
yet
the
hunger
of
their
friends
and
their
own
pride
impelled
them
to
persist
for
out
of
many
young
men
they
had
been
chosen
therefore
they
must
prove
themselves
equal
to
the
occasion
the
sun
now
well
toward
the
western
horizon
cast
over
plains
a
purplish
light
no
living
creature
was
in
sight
and
the
quest
seemed
hopeless
but
anookasan
was
not
one
to
accept
defeat
there
may
be
an
outlook
from
yonder
hill
which
will
turn
failure
into
success
he
thought
as
he
dug
his
heels
into
the
sides
of
his
faithful
nag
at
the
same
time
he
started
a
strong
heart
song
to
keep
his
courage
up
at
the
summit
of
the
ascent
he
paused
and
gazed
steadily
before
him
at
the
foot
of
the
next
coteau
he
beheld
a
strip
of
black
he
strained
his
eyes
to
look
for
the
sun
had
already
set
behind
the
hilltops
it
was
a
great
herd
of
buffaloes
he
thought
which
was
grazing
on
the
hi
hi
uncheedah
hi
hi
tunkasheedah
he
was
about
to
exclaim
in
gratitude
when
looking
more
closely
he
discovered
his
mistake
the
dark
patch
was
only
timber
his
horse
could
not
carry
him
any
further
so
he
got
off
and
ran
behind
him
toward
the
river
at
dusk
he
hailed
his
companions
ho
what
success
one
cried
not
a
sign
of
even
a
lone
bull
replied
another
yet
i
saw
a
gray
wolf
going
north
this
evening
his
direction
is
propitious
remarked
anookasan
as
he
led
the
others
down
the
slope
and
into
the
heavy
timber
the
river
just
here
made
a
sharp
turn
forming
a
densely
wooded
semicircle
in
the
shelter
of
a
high
bluff
the
braves
were
all
downhearted
because
of
their
and
only
the
sanguine
spirit
of
anookasan
kept
them
from
utter
discouragement
their
slight
repast
had
been
taken
and
each
man
had
provided
himself
with
abundance
of
dry
grass
and
twigs
for
a
bed
they
had
built
a
temporary
wigwam
of
the
same
material
in
the
center
of
which
there
was
a
generous
fire
each
man
stretched
himself
out
upon
his
robe
in
the
glow
of
it
anookasan
filled
the
red
pipe
and
having
lighted
it
he
took
one
or
two
hasty
puffs
and
held
it
up
to
the
moon
which
was
scarcely
visible
behind
the
cold
clouds
great
mother
partake
of
this
smoke
may
i
eat
meat
he
exclaimed
with
solemnity
having
uttered
this
prayer
he
handed
the
pipe
to
the
man
nearest
him
for
a
time
they
all
smoked
in
silence
then
came
a
distant
call
ah
it
is
shunkmanito
the
wolf
there
is
something
cheering
in
his
voice
declared
anookasan
yes
i
am
sure
he
is
telling
us
not
to
be
discouraged
you
know
that
the
wolf
is
one
of
our
best
friends
in
trouble
many
a
one
has
been
guided
back
to
his
home
by
him
in
a
blizzard
or
led
to
game
when
in
desperate
need
my
friends
let
us
not
turn
back
in
the
morning
let
us
go
north
one
more
day
no
one
answered
immediately
and
again
silence
reigned
while
one
by
one
they
pulled
the
reluctant
whiffs
of
smoke
through
the
long
stem
of
the
calumet
what
is
that
said
one
of
the
men
and
all
listened
intently
to
catch
the
delicate
sound
they
were
familiar
with
all
the
noises
of
the
night
and
voices
of
the
forest
but
this
was
not
like
any
of
them
it
sounds
like
the
song
of
a
mosquito
and
one
might
forget
while
he
listens
that
this
is
not
midsummer
said
one
i
hear
also
the
s
single
drumbeat
suggested
another
there
is
a
tradition
remarked
anookasan
that
many
years
ago
a
party
of
hunters
went
up
the
river
on
a
scout
like
this
of
ours
they
never
returned
afterward
in
the
summer
their
bones
were
found
near
the
home
of
a
strange
creature
said
to
be
a
little
man
but
he
had
hair
all
over
him
the
isantees
call
him
chanotedah
our
old
men
give
him
the
name
oglugechana
this
singular
being
is
said
to
be
no
larger
than
a
babe
he
speaks
an
unknown
tongue
the
home
of
oglugechana
is
usually
a
hollow
stump
around
which
all
of
the
nearest
trees
are
felled
by
lightning
there
is
an
open
spot
in
the
deep
woods
wherever
he
dwells
his
weapons
are
the
plumes
of
various
birds
great
numbers
of
these
variegated
feathers
are
to
be
found
in
the
deserted
lodge
of
the
little
man
it
is
told
by
the
old
men
that
oglugechana
has
a
weird
music
by
which
he
sometimes
bewitches
lone
travelers
he
leads
them
hither
and
thither
about
his
place
until
they
have
lost
their
senses
then
he
speaks
to
them
he
may
make
of
them
great
or
medicinemen
but
his
commands
are
hard
to
fulfill
if
any
one
sees
him
and
comes
away
before
he
is
bewildered
the
man
dies
as
soon
as
he
smells
the
or
when
he
enters
his
home
his
nearest
relative
dies
the
warrior
who
related
this
legend
assumed
the
air
of
one
who
narrates
authentic
history
and
his
listeners
appeared
to
be
seriously
impressed
what
we
call
the
supernatural
was
as
real
to
them
as
any
part
of
their
lives
this
thing
does
not
stop
to
breathe
at
all
his
music
seems
to
go
on
endlessly
said
one
with
considerable
uneasiness
it
comes
from
the
heavy
timber
north
of
us
under
the
high
cliff
reported
a
warrior
who
had
stepped
outside
of
the
rude
temporary
structure
to
inform
himself
more
clearly
of
the
direction
of
the
sound
anookasan
you
are
our
leader
tell
us
what
we
should
do
we
will
follow
you
i
believe
we
ought
to
leave
this
spot
immediately
this
is
perhaps
the
spirit
of
some
dead
enemy
suggested
another
meanwhile
the
red
pipe
was
refilled
and
sent
around
the
circle
to
calm
their
disturbed
spirits
when
the
calumet
returned
at
last
to
the
one
addressed
he
took
it
in
a
preoccupied
manner
and
spoke
between
labored
pulls
on
the
stem
i
am
just
like
yourselves
nothing
more
than
flesh
with
a
spirit
that
is
as
ready
to
leave
me
as
water
to
run
from
a
punctured
when
we
think
thus
we
are
weak
let
us
rather
think
upon
the
brave
deeds
of
our
ancestors
this
singing
spirit
has
a
gentle
voice
i
am
ready
to
follow
and
learn
if
it
be
an
enemy
or
no
let
us
all
be
found
together
next
summer
if
need
be
ho
ho
ho
was
the
response
all
put
on
your
suggested
anookasan
have
your
knives
and
arrows
ready
they
did
so
and
all
stole
silently
through
the
black
forest
in
the
direction
of
the
mysterious
sound
clearer
and
clearer
it
came
through
the
frosty
air
but
it
was
a
foreign
sound
to
the
savage
ear
now
it
seemed
to
them
almost
like
a
distant
then
it
recalled
the
low
hum
of
summer
insects
and
the
drowsy
drone
of
the
bumblebee
thump
thump
thump
was
the
regular
accompaniment
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
cliff
they
came
deeper
into
the
wild
heart
of
the
woods
at
last
out
of
the
gray
formless
night
a
dark
shape
appeared
it
looked
to
them
like
a
huge
buffalo
bull
standing
motionless
in
the
forest
and
from
his
throat
there
apparently
proceeded
the
thump
of
the
medicine
drum
and
the
song
of
the
beguiling
spirit
all
of
a
sudden
a
spark
went
up
into
the
air
as
they
continued
to
approach
there
became
visible
a
deep
glow
about
the
middle
of
the
dark
object
whatever
it
was
they
had
never
heard
of
anything
like
it
in
all
their
lives
anookasan
was
a
little
in
advance
of
his
companions
and
it
was
he
who
finally
discovered
a
wall
of
logs
laid
one
upon
another
half
way
up
there
seemed
to
be
stretched
a
from
which
a
dim
light
emanated
he
still
thought
of
oglugechana
who
dwells
within
a
hollow
tree
and
determined
to
surprise
and
if
possible
to
overpower
this
wonderworking
old
man
all
now
took
their
knives
in
their
hands
and
advanced
with
their
leader
to
the
attack
upon
the
log
hut
woo
woo
they
cried
zip
zip
went
the
door
and
window
and
they
all
rushed
in
there
sat
a
man
upon
a
roughly
hewn
stool
he
was
attired
in
wolfskins
and
wore
a
foxskin
cap
upon
his
head
the
larger
portion
of
his
face
was
clothed
with
natural
fur
a
rudely
made
cedar
fiddle
was
tucked
under
his
furred
chin
supporting
it
with
his
left
hand
he
sawed
it
vigorously
with
a
bow
that
was
not
unlike
an
indian
boy
s
miniature
weapon
while
his
moccasined
left
foot
came
down
upon
the
sod
floor
in
time
with
the
music
when
the
shrill
came
and
the
door
and
window
were
cut
in
strips
by
the
knives
of
the
indians
he
did
not
even
cease
playing
but
instinctively
he
closed
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
behold
the
horror
of
his
own
end
ii
it
was
long
ago
upon
the
rolling
prairie
south
of
the
devil
s
lake
that
a
motley
body
of
hunters
gathered
near
a
mighty
herd
of
the
bison
in
the
moon
of
falling
leaves
these
were
the
first
generation
of
the
canadian
who
sprang
up
in
such
numbers
as
to
form
almost
a
new
people
these
americans
soon
became
a
necessity
to
the
hudson
bay
company
as
they
were
the
greatest
hunters
of
the
bison
and
made
more
use
of
this
wonderful
animal
than
even
their
aboriginal
ancestors
a
curious
race
of
people
this
in
their
and
their
customs
their
shaggy
black
hair
was
allowed
to
grow
long
reaching
to
their
broad
shoulders
then
cut
off
abruptly
making
their
heads
look
like
a
thatched
house
their
dark
faces
were
in
most
cases
well
covered
with
hair
their
teeth
large
and
white
and
their
eyes
usually
liquid
black
although
occasionally
one
had
a
or
eye
their
costume
was
a
buckskin
shirt
with
abundance
of
fringes
buckskin
pantaloons
with
short
leggins
a
gay
sash
and
a
cap
of
their
arms
consisted
of
guns
hatchets
and
their
ponies
were
small
but
as
hardy
as
themselves
as
these
men
gathered
in
the
neighborhood
of
an
immense
herd
of
buffaloes
they
busied
themselves
in
adjusting
the
girths
of
their
beautifully
beaded
saddles
among
them
there
were
exceptional
riders
and
hunters
it
was
said
that
few
could
equal
antoine
michaud
in
feats
of
riding
into
and
through
the
herd
there
he
stood
all
alone
the
observed
of
many
others
it
was
his
habit
to
give
several
indian
yells
when
the
onset
began
so
as
to
insure
a
successful
hunt
in
this
instance
antoine
gave
his
usual
whoops
and
when
they
had
almost
reached
the
herd
he
lifted
his
over
his
head
and
plunged
into
the
black
moving
mass
with
a
sound
like
the
distant
rumbling
of
thunder
those
tens
of
thousands
of
buffalo
hoofs
were
pounding
the
earth
in
retreat
thus
antoine
disappeared
his
wild
steed
dashed
into
the
midst
of
the
vast
herd
fortunately
for
him
the
animals
kept
clear
of
him
but
alas
the
gap
through
which
he
had
entered
instantly
closed
again
he
yelled
frantically
to
secure
an
outlet
but
without
effect
he
had
tied
a
red
bandanna
around
his
head
to
keep
the
hair
off
his
face
and
he
now
took
this
off
and
swung
it
crazily
about
him
to
scatter
the
buffalo
but
it
availed
him
nothing
with
such
a
mighty
herd
in
flight
the
speed
could
not
be
great
therefore
the
bois
brule
settled
himself
to
the
situation
allowing
his
pony
to
canter
along
slowly
to
save
his
strength
it
required
much
tact
and
presence
of
mind
to
keep
an
open
space
for
the
few
paces
of
obstruction
behind
had
gradually
grown
into
a
mile
the
mighty
host
moved
continually
southward
walking
and
running
alternately
as
the
sun
neared
the
western
horizon
it
fired
the
sky
above
them
and
all
the
distant
hills
and
prairies
were
in
the
glow
of
it
but
immediately
about
them
was
a
thick
cloud
of
dust
and
the
ground
appeared
like
a
plain
suddenly
antoine
was
aware
of
a
tremendous
push
from
behind
the
animals
smelled
the
cool
water
of
a
spring
which
formed
a
large
bog
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
this
solitary
pond
or
marsh
was
a
for
the
wild
animals
all
pushed
and
edged
toward
it
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
withstand
the
combined
strength
of
so
many
antoine
and
his
steed
were
in
imminent
danger
of
being
pushed
into
the
mire
and
trampled
upon
but
a
mere
chance
brought
them
upon
solid
ground
as
they
were
crowded
across
the
marsh
his
pony
drank
heartily
and
he
for
the
first
time
let
go
his
bridle
put
his
two
palms
together
for
a
dipper
and
drank
greedily
of
the
bitter
water
he
had
not
eaten
since
early
morning
so
he
now
pulled
up
some
bulrushes
and
ate
of
the
tender
bulbs
while
the
pony
grazed
as
best
he
could
on
the
tops
of
the
tall
grass
it
was
now
dark
the
night
was
wellnigh
intolerable
for
antoine
the
buffalo
were
about
him
in
countless
numbers
regarding
him
with
vicious
glances
it
was
only
by
reason
of
the
natural
offensiveness
of
man
that
they
gave
him
any
space
the
bellowing
of
the
bulls
became
general
and
there
was
a
marked
uneasiness
on
the
part
of
the
herd
this
was
a
sign
of
approaching
storm
therefore
the
unfortunate
hunter
had
this
additional
cause
for
anxiety
upon
the
western
horizon
were
seen
some
flashes
of
lightning
the
cloud
which
had
been
a
mere
speck
upon
the
horizon
had
now
increased
to
large
proportions
suddenly
the
wind
came
and
lightning
flashes
became
more
frequent
showing
the
ungainly
forms
of
the
animals
like
strange
monsters
in
the
white
light
the
colossal
herd
was
again
in
violent
motion
it
was
a
blind
rush
for
shelter
and
no
heed
was
paid
to
buffalo
wallows
or
even
deep
gulches
all
was
in
the
deepest
of
darkness
there
seemed
to
be
groaning
in
heaven
and
earth
millions
of
hoofs
and
throats
roaring
in
unison
as
a
shipwrecked
man
clings
to
a
mere
fragment
of
wood
so
antoine
although
almost
exhausted
with
fatigue
still
stuck
to
the
back
of
his
equally
plucky
pony
death
was
imminent
for
them
both
as
the
mad
rush
continued
every
flash
displayed
heaps
of
bison
in
death
struggle
under
the
hoofs
of
their
companions
from
time
to
time
antoine
crossed
himself
and
whispered
a
prayer
to
the
virgin
and
again
he
spoke
to
his
horse
after
the
fashion
of
an
indian
be
brave
be
strong
my
horse
if
we
survive
this
trial
you
shall
have
great
honor
the
stampede
continued
until
they
reached
the
bottom
lands
and
like
a
rushing
stream
their
course
was
turned
aside
by
the
steep
bank
of
a
creek
or
small
river
then
they
moved
more
slowly
in
wide
sweeps
or
circles
until
the
storm
ceased
and
the
exhausted
hunter
still
in
his
saddle
took
some
snatches
of
sleep
when
he
awoke
and
looked
about
him
again
it
was
morning
the
herd
had
entered
the
strip
of
timber
which
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
it
was
here
that
antoine
conceived
his
first
distinct
hope
of
saving
himself
waw
waw
waw
was
the
hoarse
cry
that
came
to
his
ears
apparently
from
a
human
being
in
distress
antoine
strained
his
eyes
and
craned
his
neck
to
see
who
it
could
be
through
an
opening
in
the
branches
ahead
he
perceived
a
large
grizzly
bear
lying
along
an
inclined
limb
and
hugging
it
desperately
to
maintain
his
position
the
herd
had
now
thoroughly
pervaded
the
timber
and
the
bear
was
likewise
hemmed
in
he
had
taken
to
his
unaccustomed
refuge
after
making
a
brave
stand
against
several
bulls
one
of
which
lay
dead
near
by
while
he
himself
was
bleeding
from
many
wounds
antoine
had
been
assiduously
looking
for
a
friendly
tree
by
means
of
which
he
hoped
to
effect
his
escape
from
captivity
by
the
army
of
bison
his
horse
by
chance
made
his
way
directly
under
the
very
that
was
sustaining
the
bear
and
there
was
a
convenient
branch
just
within
his
reach
the
bois
brule
was
not
then
in
an
aggressive
mood
and
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
occupant
of
the
tree
would
not
interfere
with
him
they
were
in
fact
companions
in
distress
antoine
tried
to
give
a
as
he
sprang
desperately
from
the
pony
s
back
and
seized
the
cross
limb
with
both
his
hands
the
hunter
dangled
in
the
air
for
a
minute
that
to
him
seemed
a
year
then
he
gathered
up
all
the
strength
that
was
in
him
and
with
one
grand
effort
he
pulled
himself
up
on
the
limb
if
he
had
failed
in
this
he
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
under
the
hoofs
of
the
buffaloes
and
at
their
mercy
after
he
had
adjusted
his
seat
as
comfortably
as
he
could
antoine
surveyed
the
situation
he
had
at
least
escaped
from
sudden
and
certain
death
it
grieved
him
that
he
had
been
forced
to
abandon
his
horse
and
he
had
no
idea
how
far
he
had
come
nor
any
means
of
returning
to
his
friends
who
had
no
doubt
given
him
up
for
lost
his
immediate
needs
were
rest
and
food
accordingly
he
selected
a
fat
cow
and
emptied
into
her
sides
one
barrel
of
his
gun
which
had
been
slung
across
his
chest
he
went
on
shooting
until
he
had
killed
many
fat
cows
greatly
to
the
discomfiture
of
his
neighbor
the
bear
while
the
bison
vainly
struggled
among
themselves
to
keep
the
fatal
spot
clear
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
main
body
of
the
herd
had
passed
and
antoine
was
sure
that
his
captivity
had
at
last
come
to
an
end
then
he
swung
himself
from
his
limb
to
the
ground
and
walked
stiffly
to
the
carcass
of
the
nearest
cow
which
he
dressed
and
prepared
himself
a
meal
but
first
he
took
a
piece
of
liver
on
a
long
pole
to
the
bear
antoine
finally
decided
to
settle
in
the
recesses
of
the
heavy
timber
for
the
winter
as
he
was
on
foot
and
alone
and
not
able
to
travel
any
great
distance
he
jerked
the
meat
of
all
the
animals
he
had
killed
and
prepared
their
skins
for
bedding
and
clothing
the
bois
brule
and
ami
as
he
called
the
bear
soon
became
necessary
to
one
another
the
former
considered
the
bear
very
good
company
and
the
latter
had
learned
that
man
s
business
after
all
is
not
to
kill
every
animal
he
meets
he
had
been
fed
and
kindly
treated
when
helpless
from
his
wounds
and
this
he
could
not
forget
antoine
was
soon
busy
erecting
a
small
log
hut
while
the
other
partner
kept
a
sharp
lookout
and
after
his
hurts
were
healed
often
brought
in
some
small
game
the
two
had
a
perfect
understanding
without
many
words
at
least
the
speech
was
all
upon
one
side
in
his
leisure
moments
antoine
had
occupied
himself
with
whittling
out
a
rude
fiddle
of
strung
with
the
guts
of
a
wild
cat
that
he
had
killed
every
evening
that
winter
he
would
sit
down
after
supper
and
play
all
the
old
familiar
pieces
varied
with
improvisations
of
his
own
at
first
the
music
and
the
incessant
pounding
time
with
his
foot
annoyed
the
bear
at
times
too
the
canadian
would
call
out
the
figures
for
the
dance
all
this
ami
became
accustomed
to
in
time
and
even
showed
no
small
interest
in
the
buzzing
of
the
little
cedar
box
not
infrequently
he
was
out
in
the
evening
and
the
human
partner
was
left
alone
it
chanced
quite
fortunately
that
the
bear
was
absent
on
the
night
that
the
red
folk
rudely
invaded
the
lonely
hut
the
calmness
of
the
strange
being
had
stayed
their
hands
they
had
never
before
seen
a
man
of
other
race
than
their
own
is
this
chanotedah
is
he
man
or
beast
the
warriors
asked
one
another
ho
wake
up
koda
exclaimed
anookasan
maybe
he
is
of
the
porcupine
tribe
ashamed
to
look
at
us
at
this
moment
they
spied
the
haunch
of
venison
which
swung
from
a
over
a
fine
bed
of
coals
in
front
of
the
rude
mud
chimney
ho
koda
has
something
to
eat
sit
down
sit
down
they
shouted
to
one
another
now
antoine
opened
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
upon
his
guests
they
were
a
haggard
and
set
anookasan
extended
his
hand
and
antoine
gave
it
a
hearty
shake
he
set
his
fiddle
against
the
wall
and
began
to
cut
up
the
smoking
venison
into
generous
pieces
and
place
it
before
them
all
ate
like
famished
men
while
the
firelight
intensified
the
red
paint
upon
their
wild
and
warlike
faces
when
he
had
satisfied
his
first
hunger
anookasan
spoke
in
signs
friend
we
have
never
before
heard
a
song
like
that
of
your
little
cedar
box
we
had
supposed
it
to
be
a
spirit
or
some
harmful
thing
hence
our
attack
upon
it
we
never
saw
any
people
of
your
sort
what
is
your
tribe
antoine
explained
his
plight
in
the
same
manner
and
the
two
soon
came
to
an
understanding
the
canadian
told
the
starving
hunters
of
a
buffalo
herd
a
little
way
to
the
north
and
one
of
their
number
was
dispatched
homeward
with
the
news
in
two
days
the
entire
band
reached
antoine
s
place
the
bois
brule
was
treated
with
kindness
and
honor
and
the
tribe
gave
him
a
wife
suffice
it
to
say
that
antoine
lived
and
died
among
the
yanktons
at
a
good
old
age
but
ami
could
not
brook
the
invasion
upon
their
hermit
life
he
was
never
seen
after
that
first
evening
iv
the
famine
on
the
assiniboine
river
in
western
manitoba
there
stands
an
old
historic
whose
crumbling
walls
crown
a
high
promontory
in
the
angle
formed
by
its
junction
with
a
tributary
stream
this
is
fort
ellis
a
mistress
of
the
wilderness
and
lodestone
of
savage
tribes
between
the
years
and
hither
at
that
early
day
the
indians
brought
their
buffalo
robes
and
beaver
skins
to
exchange
for
merchandise
ammunition
and
the
spirit
among
the
others
there
presently
appeared
a
band
of
renegade
sioux
the
exiles
as
they
called
themselves
under
white
lodge
whose
father
little
crow
had
been
a
leader
in
the
outbreak
of
now
the
great
warchief
was
dead
and
his
people
were
prisoners
or
fugitives
the
shrewd
scotch
trader
mcleod
soon
discovered
that
the
sioux
were
skilled
hunters
and
therefore
he
exerted
himself
to
befriend
them
as
well
as
to
encourage
a
feeling
of
good
will
between
them
and
the
canadian
tribes
who
were
accustomed
to
make
the
old
fort
their
summer
rendezvous
now
the
autumn
had
come
after
a
long
summer
of
feasts
and
dances
and
the
three
tribes
broke
up
and
dispersed
as
usual
in
various
directions
white
lodge
had
twin
daughters
very
handsome
whose
ears
had
been
kept
burning
with
the
proposals
of
many
suitors
but
none
had
received
any
definite
encouragement
there
were
one
or
two
who
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
forsake
their
own
tribes
and
follow
the
exiles
had
they
not
feared
too
much
the
ridicule
of
the
braves
even
angus
mcleod
the
trader
s
eldest
son
had
need
of
all
his
patience
and
caution
for
he
had
never
seen
any
woman
he
admired
so
much
as
the
piquant
magaskawee
called
the
swan
one
of
these
belles
of
the
forest
the
sioux
journeyed
northward
toward
the
mouse
river
they
had
wintered
on
that
stream
before
and
it
was
then
the
feeding
ground
of
large
herds
of
buffalo
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
herds
were
moving
westward
across
the
missouri
there
was
no
little
apprehension
the
shrewd
became
aware
of
the
situation
and
hastened
to
announce
his
prophecy
the
great
mystery
has
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
he
showed
me
men
with
haggard
and
thin
faces
i
interpret
this
to
mean
a
scarcity
of
food
during
the
the
chief
called
his
counselors
together
and
set
before
them
the
dream
of
the
priest
whose
prophecy
he
said
was
already
being
fulfilled
in
part
by
the
westward
movement
of
the
buffalo
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
lay
up
all
the
dried
meat
they
could
obtain
but
even
for
this
they
were
too
late
the
storms
were
already
at
hand
and
that
winter
was
more
severe
than
any
that
the
old
men
could
recall
in
their
traditions
the
braves
killed
all
the
small
game
for
a
wide
circuit
around
the
camp
but
the
buffalo
had
now
crossed
the
river
and
that
country
was
not
favorable
for
deer
the
more
enterprising
young
men
organized
hunting
expeditions
to
various
parts
of
the
open
prairie
but
each
time
they
returned
with
empty
hands
the
moon
of
sore
eyes
or
march
had
come
at
last
and
wazeah
the
god
of
storm
was
still
angry
their
scant
provision
of
dried
meat
had
held
out
wonderfully
but
it
was
now
all
but
consumed
the
sioux
had
but
little
ammunition
and
the
snow
was
still
so
deep
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
move
away
to
any
other
region
in
search
of
game
the
worst
was
feared
indeed
some
of
the
children
and
feeble
old
people
had
already
succumbed
white
lodge
again
called
his
men
together
in
council
and
it
was
determined
to
send
a
messenger
to
fort
ellis
to
ask
for
relief
a
young
man
called
was
chosen
for
his
exceptional
qualities
of
speed
and
endurance
upon
long
journeys
the
old
whose
shrewd
prophecy
had
gained
for
him
the
confidence
of
the
people
now
came
forward
he
had
closely
observed
the
appearance
of
the
messenger
selected
and
had
taken
note
of
the
storm
and
distance
accordingly
he
said
my
children
the
great
mystery
is
offended
and
this
is
the
cause
of
all
our
suffering
i
see
a
shadow
hanging
over
our
messenger
but
i
will
pray
to
the
great
spirit
perhaps
he
may
yet
save
him
great
mystery
be
thou
merciful
strengthen
this
young
man
for
his
journey
that
he
may
be
able
to
finish
it
and
to
send
us
aid
if
we
see
the
sun
of
summer
again
we
will
offer
the
choicest
of
our
meats
to
thee
and
do
thee
great
honor
during
this
invocation
as
occasionally
happens
in
march
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
was
heard
this
coincidence
threw
the
prophet
almost
into
a
frenzy
and
the
poor
people
were
all
of
a
tremble
believed
that
the
prayer
was
directly
answered
and
though
weakened
by
fasting
and
unfit
for
the
task
before
him
he
was
encouraged
to
make
the
attempt
he
set
out
on
the
following
day
at
dawn
and
on
the
third
day
staggered
into
the
fort
looking
like
a
specter
and
almost
frightening
the
people
he
was
taken
to
mcleod
s
house
and
given
good
care
the
poor
fellow
delirious
with
hunger
fancied
himself
engaged
in
mortal
combat
with
eyah
the
god
of
famine
who
has
a
mouth
extending
from
ear
to
ear
wherever
he
goes
there
is
famine
for
he
swallows
all
that
he
sees
even
whole
nations
the
legend
has
it
that
eyah
fears
nothing
but
the
jingling
of
metal
so
finally
the
dying
man
looked
up
into
mcleod
s
face
and
cried
ring
your
bell
in
his
face
wahadah
the
factor
could
not
refuse
and
as
the
great
bell
used
to
mark
the
hours
of
work
and
of
meals
pealed
out
untimely
upon
the
frosty
air
the
indian
started
up
and
in
that
moment
breathed
his
last
he
had
given
no
news
and
mcleod
and
his
sons
could
only
guess
at
the
state
of
affairs
upon
the
mouse
river
while
the
men
were
in
council
with
her
father
magaskawee
had
turned
over
the
contents
of
her
she
had
found
a
small
roll
of
in
which
she
kept
her
porcupine
quills
for
embroidery
and
pulled
the
delicate
layers
apart
the
white
swan
was
not
altogether
the
untutored
indian
maiden
for
she
had
lived
in
the
family
of
a
missionary
in
the
states
and
had
learned
both
to
speak
and
write
some
english
there
was
no
ink
no
pen
or
pencil
but
with
her
bone
awl
she
pressed
upon
the
white
side
of
the
bark
the
following
words
angus
mcleod
we
are
near
the
hollow
rock
on
the
mouse
river
the
buffalo
went
away
across
the
missouri
and
our
powder
and
shot
are
gone
we
are
starving
if
i
don
t
see
you
again
magaskawee
the
girl
entrusted
this
little
note
to
her
grandmother
and
she
in
turn
gave
it
to
the
messenger
but
he
as
we
know
was
unable
to
deliver
it
angus
tell
the
boys
to
bury
the
poor
fellow
i
dare
say
he
brought
us
some
news
from
white
lodge
but
we
have
got
to
go
to
the
happy
to
get
it
or
wait
till
the
exile
band
returns
in
the
spring
evidently
continued
mcleod
he
fell
sick
on
the
way
or
else
he
was
starving
this
last
suggestion
horrified
angus
i
believe
father
he
exclaimed
that
we
ought
to
examine
his
a
small
oblong
packet
was
brought
forth
from
the
dead
man
s
belt
and
carefully
unrolled
there
were
several
pairs
of
moccasins
and
within
one
of
these
angus
found
something
wrapped
up
nicely
he
proceeded
to
unwind
the
long
strings
of
deerskin
with
which
it
was
securely
tied
and
brought
forth
a
thin
sheet
of
at
first
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
but
a
closer
scrutiny
revealed
the
impression
of
the
awl
and
the
bit
of
nature
s
parchment
was
brought
nearer
to
his
face
and
scanned
with
a
zeal
equal
to
that
of
any
student
of
ancient
hieroglyphics
this
tells
the
whole
story
father
exclaimed
the
young
man
at
last
magaskawee
s
note
just
listen
and
he
read
it
aloud
i
shall
start
we
can
take
enough
provision
and
ammunition
on
two
sleds
with
six
dogs
to
each
i
shall
want
three
good
men
to
go
with
angus
spoke
with
decision
well
we
can
t
afford
to
lose
our
best
hunters
and
you
might
also
bring
home
with
you
what
furs
and
robes
they
have
on
hand
was
his
father
s
prudent
reply
i
don
t
care
particularly
for
the
skins
angus
declared
but
he
at
once
began
hurried
preparations
for
departure
in
the
meantime
affairs
grew
daily
more
desperate
in
the
exile
village
on
the
mouse
river
and
a
sort
of
indian
hopelessness
and
resignation
settled
down
upon
the
little
community
there
were
few
who
really
expected
their
messenger
to
reach
the
fort
or
believed
that
even
if
he
did
so
relief
would
be
sent
in
time
to
save
them
white
lodge
the
father
of
his
people
was
determined
to
share
with
them
the
last
mouthful
of
food
and
every
morning
winona
and
magaskawee
went
with
scanty
portions
in
their
hands
to
those
whose
supply
had
entirely
failed
on
the
outskirts
of
the
camp
there
dwelt
an
old
woman
with
an
orphan
grandchild
who
had
been
denying
herself
for
some
time
in
order
that
the
child
might
live
longer
this
poor
teepee
the
girls
visited
often
and
one
on
each
side
they
raised
the
exhausted
woman
and
poured
into
her
mouth
the
warm
broth
they
had
brought
with
them
it
was
on
the
very
day
reached
fort
ellis
that
a
young
hunter
who
had
ventured
further
from
the
camp
than
any
one
else
had
the
luck
to
bring
down
a
solitary
deer
with
his
bow
and
arrow
in
his
weakness
he
had
reached
camp
very
late
bearing
the
deer
with
the
utmost
difficulty
upon
his
shoulders
it
was
instantly
separated
into
as
many
pieces
as
there
were
lodges
of
the
famishing
sioux
these
delicious
morsels
were
hastily
cooked
and
eagerly
devoured
but
among
so
many
there
was
scarcely
more
than
a
mouthful
to
the
share
of
each
and
the
brave
youth
himself
did
not
receive
enough
to
appease
in
the
least
his
craving
on
the
eve
of
angus
departure
for
the
exile
village
three
stars
a
devoted
suitor
of
winona
s
accompanied
by
another
assiniboine
brave
appeared
unexpectedly
at
the
fort
he
at
once
asked
permission
to
join
the
relief
party
and
they
set
out
at
daybreak
the
was
the
old
reliable
mack
who
had
been
in
service
for
several
seasons
on
winter
trips
all
of
the
white
men
were
clad
in
buckskin
shirts
and
pantaloons
with
long
fringes
down
the
sides
fur
caps
and
moccasins
their
guns
were
fastened
to
the
long
sleds
the
snow
had
thawed
a
little
and
formed
an
icy
crust
and
over
this
fresh
snow
had
fallen
which
a
northwest
wind
swept
over
the
surface
like
ashes
after
a
prairie
fire
the
sun
appeared
for
a
little
time
in
the
morning
but
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
cutting
short
his
course
on
account
of
the
bleak
day
and
had
protected
himself
with
pale
rings
of
fire
the
dogs
laid
back
their
ears
drew
in
their
tails
and
struck
into
their
customary
trot
but
even
old
mack
looked
back
frequently
as
if
reluctant
to
face
such
a
pricking
and
scarifying
wind
the
men
felt
the
cold
still
more
keenly
although
they
had
taken
care
to
cover
every
bit
of
the
face
except
one
eye
and
that
was
completely
blinded
at
times
by
the
granulated
snow
the
sun
early
retreated
behind
a
wall
of
cloud
and
the
wind
moaned
and
wailed
like
a
living
creature
in
anguish
at
last
they
approached
the
creek
where
they
had
planned
to
camp
for
the
night
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
few
stunted
willows
half
buried
in
the
drifts
but
the
banks
of
the
little
stream
afforded
some
protection
from
the
wind
whoa
shouted
the
leader
and
the
dogs
all
stopped
sitting
down
on
their
haunches
come
mack
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
lead
your
fellows
down
to
the
creek
the
old
dog
started
down
at
the
word
and
all
the
rest
followed
a
space
was
quickly
cleared
of
snow
while
one
man
scoured
the
thickets
in
search
of
brush
for
fuel
in
a
few
minutes
the
tent
was
up
and
a
fire
kindled
in
the
center
while
the
floor
was
thickly
strewn
with
twigs
of
willow
over
which
buffalo
robes
were
spread
three
stars
attended
to
supper
and
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
snapping
willow
fire
a
kettle
was
boiling
all
partook
of
strong
tea
dried
meat
of
buffalo
and
pemmican
a
mixture
of
pounded
dried
meat
with
wild
cherries
and
melted
fat
the
dogs
to
whom
the
tent
was
assigned
enjoyed
a
hearty
meal
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
lying
one
against
another
after
supper
jerry
drove
two
sticks
into
the
ground
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
and
connected
the
two
by
a
third
one
over
the
blaze
upon
this
all
hung
their
socks
to
dry
most
of
them
merely
square
pieces
of
blanket
cut
to
serve
that
purpose
soon
each
man
rolled
himself
in
his
own
buffalo
robe
and
fell
asleep
all
night
the
wind
raged
the
lonely
teepee
now
and
then
shuddered
violently
as
a
stronger
blast
than
usual
almost
lifted
it
from
the
ground
no
one
stirred
except
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
dogs
who
got
up
snarling
and
sniffing
the
cold
air
turned
himself
round
several
times
as
if
on
a
pivot
and
finally
lay
down
for
another
nap
in
the
morning
the
travelers
one
by
one
raised
their
heads
and
looked
through
the
then
fell
back
again
with
a
grunt
all
the
world
appeared
without
form
and
void
presently
however
the
light
of
the
sun
was
seen
as
if
through
a
painted
window
and
by
afternoon
they
were
able
to
go
on
the
wind
having
partially
subsided
this
was
only
a
taste
of
the
weather
encountered
by
the
party
on
their
unseasonable
trip
but
had
it
been
ten
times
harder
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
angus
to
turn
back
on
the
third
day
the
rescuers
approached
the
camp
of
the
exiles
there
was
an
ominous
quiet
no
creature
was
to
be
seen
but
the
smoke
which
ascended
into
the
air
in
perpendicular
columns
assured
them
that
some
at
least
were
still
alive
the
party
happened
to
reach
first
the
teepee
of
the
poor
old
woman
who
had
been
so
faithfully
ministered
to
by
the
twin
sisters
they
had
no
longer
any
food
to
give
but
they
had
come
to
build
her
fire
if
she
should
have
survived
the
night
at
the
very
door
of
the
lodge
they
heard
the
jingle
of
but
they
had
not
time
to
announce
the
joyful
news
before
the
men
were
in
sight
in
another
minute
angus
and
three
stars
were
beside
them
holding
their
wasted
hands
the
chief
soldier
just
outside
of
a
fine
large
wigwam
of
stood
tawasuota
very
early
upon
an
august
morning
of
the
year
behind
the
wigwam
there
might
have
been
seen
a
thrifty
patch
of
growing
maize
whose
tall
graceful
stalks
resembled
as
many
warriors
in
and
tasseled
thanks
be
to
the
great
mystery
i
have
been
successful
in
the
fortunes
of
war
none
can
say
that
tawasuota
is
a
coward
i
have
done
well
so
well
that
our
chief
little
crow
has
offered
me
the
honored
position
of
his
chief
soldier
ta
he
said
to
himself
with
satisfaction
the
sun
was
just
over
the
eastem
bank
of
the
minnesota
river
and
he
could
distinctly
see
upon
the
level
prairie
the
dwellings
of
logs
which
had
sprung
up
there
during
the
year
since
little
crow
s
last
treaty
with
the
whites
ugh
they
are
taking
from
us
our
beautiful
and
country
was
his
thought
as
he
gazed
upon
them
at
that
moment
out
of
the
conical
white
teepee
in
shape
like
a
mushroom
there
burst
two
little
frisky
boys
leaping
and
whooping
they
were
clad
gracefully
in
garments
of
fine
deerskin
and
each
wore
a
miniature
feather
upon
his
head
marking
them
as
children
of
a
distinguished
warrior
they
danced
nimbly
around
their
father
while
he
stood
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
buck
elk
viewing
the
landscape
reddened
by
sunrise
and
the
dwellers
therein
the
old
and
the
new
the
red
and
the
white
he
noticed
that
they
were
still
unmingled
the
river
divided
them
at
last
he
took
the
dancing
little
embryo
warriors
one
in
either
hand
and
lifted
them
to
his
majestic
shoulders
there
he
placed
them
in
perfect
poise
his
haughty
spirit
found
a
moment
s
happiness
in
fatherhood
suddenly
tawasuota
set
the
two
boys
on
the
ground
again
and
signed
to
them
to
enter
the
teepee
apparently
all
was
quiet
the
camps
and
villages
of
the
minnesota
reservation
were
undisturbed
so
far
as
he
could
see
save
by
the
awakening
of
nature
and
the
early
risers
among
his
people
moved
about
in
seeming
security
while
the
smoke
of
their
morning
fires
arose
one
by
one
into
the
blue
still
the
warrior
gazed
steadily
westward
up
the
river
whence
his
quick
ear
had
caught
the
faint
but
ominous
sound
of
a
distant
the
ridge
beyond
the
wahpeton
village
bounded
the
view
and
between
this
point
and
his
own
village
were
the
agency
buildings
and
the
traders
stores
the
indian
s
keen
eye
swept
the
horizon
and
finally
alighted
once
more
upon
the
home
of
his
new
neighbor
across
the
river
the
white
man
with
many
children
who
with
his
white
squaw
and
his
little
ones
worked
from
sunrise
to
sunset
much
like
the
beaver
family
ah
the
distant
once
more
saluted
his
ear
but
this
time
nearer
and
more
distinct
what
the
rice
creek
band
is
coming
in
full
can
it
be
another
ojibway
attack
ugh
ugh
i
will
show
their
warriors
again
this
day
what
it
is
to
fight
he
exclaimed
aloud
the
white
traders
and
government
employees
those
of
them
who
were
up
and
about
heard
and
saw
the
advancing
column
of
warriors
yet
they
showed
no
sign
of
anxiety
or
fear
most
of
them
thought
that
there
might
be
some
report
of
ojibways
coming
to
attack
the
sioux
a
not
uncommon
incident
and
that
those
warriors
were
on
their
way
to
the
post
to
replenish
their
a
few
of
the
younger
men
were
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
witnessing
an
indian
fight
on
swept
the
armed
band
in
numbers
increasing
at
every
village
it
was
true
that
there
had
been
a
growing
feeling
of
distrust
among
the
indians
because
their
annuities
had
been
withheld
for
a
long
time
and
the
money
payments
had
been
delayed
again
and
again
there
were
many
in
great
need
the
traders
had
given
them
credit
to
some
extent
charging
them
four
times
the
value
of
the
article
purchased
and
had
likewise
induced
little
crow
to
sign
over
to
them
thousand
dollars
the
of
that
part
of
their
reservation
lying
north
of
the
minnesota
and
already
occupied
by
the
whites
this
act
had
made
the
chief
very
unpopular
and
he
was
ready
for
a
desperate
venture
to
regain
his
influence
certain
warriors
among
the
upper
bands
of
sioux
had
even
threatened
his
life
but
no
one
spoke
openly
of
a
break
with
the
whites
when
therefore
the
news
came
to
little
crow
that
some
roving
hunters
of
the
rice
creek
band
had
killed
in
a
brawl
two
families
of
white
settlers
he
saw
his
opportunity
to
show
once
for
all
to
the
disaffected
that
he
had
no
love
for
the
white
man
immediately
he
sprang
upon
his
white
horse
and
prepared
to
make
their
cause
a
general
one
among
his
people
tawasuota
had
scarcely
finished
his
hasty
preparations
for
war
by
painting
his
face
and
seeing
to
the
loading
of
his
gun
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
little
crow
outside
his
lodge
you
are
now
my
head
soldier
said
the
chief
and
this
is
your
first
duty
little
six
and
his
band
have
inaugurated
the
war
against
the
whites
they
have
already
wiped
out
two
families
and
are
now
on
their
way
to
the
agency
let
my
chief
soldier
fire
the
first
shot
those
indians
who
have
cut
their
hair
and
donned
the
white
man
s
clothing
may
give
the
warning
so
make
haste
if
you
fall
there
is
no
better
day
on
which
to
die
and
the
women
of
our
tribe
will
weep
proud
tears
for
tawasuota
i
leave
it
with
you
to
lead
my
with
these
words
the
wily
chief
galloped
away
to
meet
the
here
comes
little
crow
the
friend
of
the
white
man
exclaimed
a
warrior
as
he
approached
friends
and
warriors
you
will
learn
who
are
the
friends
of
the
white
man
and
none
will
dare
again
to
insinuate
that
i
have
been
against
the
interests
of
my
own
people
he
replied
after
a
brief
consultation
with
the
chiefs
he
advised
the
traders
do
not
hesitate
to
fill
the
of
my
warriors
they
may
be
compelled
to
fight
all
soon
loud
yells
were
heard
along
the
road
to
the
indian
village
ho
ho
tawasuota
u
ye
do
he
is
coming
he
is
coming
shouted
the
warriors
in
chorus
the
famous
dismounted
in
silence
gun
in
hand
and
walked
directly
toward
the
larger
store
friend
he
exclaimed
we
may
both
meet
the
great
mystery
but
you
must
go
there
was
a
loud
report
and
the
unsuspecting
white
man
lay
dead
it
was
james
lynd
one
of
the
early
traders
and
a
good
friend
to
the
indians
no
sooner
had
tawasuota
fired
the
fatal
shot
than
every
other
indian
discharged
his
piece
hither
and
thither
ran
the
frantic
people
seeking
safety
but
seeking
it
in
vain
they
were
wholly
unprepared
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
foe
the
friendly
indians
too
were
taken
entirely
by
surprise
they
had
often
heard
wild
talk
of
revolt
but
it
had
never
had
the
indorsement
of
intelligent
chiefs
or
of
such
a
number
as
to
carry
any
weight
to
their
minds
christian
indians
rushed
in
every
direction
to
save
if
possible
at
least
the
wives
and
children
of
the
government
employees
meanwhile
the
new
white
settlements
along
the
minnesota
river
were
utterly
unconscious
of
any
danger
not
a
soul
dreamed
of
the
terrible
calamity
that
each
passing
moment
was
bringing
nearer
and
nearer
tawasuota
stepped
aside
and
took
up
his
pipe
he
seemed
almost
oblivious
of
what
he
had
done
while
the
massacre
still
raged
about
him
in
all
its
awful
cruelty
he
sat
smoking
and
trying
to
think
collectedly
but
his
mind
was
confused
and
in
his
secret
thoughts
he
rebelled
against
little
crow
it
was
a
cowardly
deed
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
commit
he
thought
for
he
had
won
his
reputation
solely
by
brave
deeds
in
battle
and
this
was
more
like
murdering
one
of
his
own
tribesmen
this
killing
of
an
unarmed
white
man
up
to
this
time
the
killing
of
a
white
man
was
not
counted
the
deed
of
a
warrior
it
was
murder
the
lesser
braves
might
now
satisfy
their
spite
against
the
traders
to
their
hearts
content
but
tawasuota
had
been
upon
the
best
of
terms
with
all
of
them
suddenly
a
ringing
shout
was
heard
the
chief
soldier
looked
up
and
beheld
a
white
man
nearly
nude
leap
from
the
roof
of
the
larger
store
and
alight
upon
the
ground
hard
by
him
he
had
emptied
one
barrel
of
his
gun
and
if
he
chose
to
do
so
could
have
killed
myrick
then
and
there
but
he
made
no
move
exclaiming
ho
ho
nina
iyaye
run
run
away
sped
the
white
man
in
the
direction
of
the
woods
and
the
river
ah
he
is
swift
he
will
save
himself
thought
tawasuota
all
the
indians
had
now
spied
the
fugitive
they
yelled
and
fired
at
him
again
and
again
as
if
they
were
shooting
at
a
running
deer
but
he
only
ran
faster
just
as
he
had
reached
the
very
edge
of
the
sheltering
timber
a
single
shot
rang
out
and
he
fell
headlong
a
loud
went
up
for
many
believed
that
this
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
stolen
their
trust
funds
tawasuota
continued
to
sit
and
smoke
in
the
shade
while
the
carnage
and
plunder
that
he
had
set
on
foot
proceeded
on
all
sides
of
him
presently
men
began
to
form
small
parties
to
cross
the
river
on
their
mission
of
death
but
he
refused
to
join
any
of
them
at
last
several
of
the
older
warriors
came
up
to
smoke
with
him
ho
nephew
said
one
of
them
with
much
gravity
you
have
precipitated
a
dreadful
calamity
this
means
the
loss
of
our
country
the
destruction
of
our
nation
what
were
you
thinking
of
it
was
the
wahpeton
chief
who
spoke
a
to
tawasuota
he
did
not
at
once
reply
but
filled
his
pipe
in
silence
and
handed
it
to
the
man
who
thus
reproached
him
it
was
a
just
rebuke
for
he
was
a
brave
man
and
he
could
have
refused
the
request
of
his
chief
to
open
the
massacre
at
this
moment
it
was
announced
that
a
body
of
white
soldiers
were
on
the
march
from
fort
ridgeley
a
large
body
of
warriors
set
out
to
meet
them
nephew
you
have
spilled
the
first
blood
of
the
white
man
go
join
in
battle
with
the
soldiers
they
are
armed
they
can
defend
themselves
remarked
the
old
chief
and
tawasuota
replied
uncle
you
speak
truth
i
have
committed
the
act
of
a
coward
it
was
not
of
my
own
will
i
did
it
nevertheless
i
have
raised
my
weapon
and
i
will
fight
the
whites
as
long
as
i
live
if
i
am
ever
taken
they
will
first
have
to
kill
he
arose
took
up
his
gun
and
joined
the
the
dreadful
day
of
massacre
was
almost
ended
the
terrified
sioux
women
and
children
had
fled
up
the
river
before
the
approaching
troops
long
shafts
of
light
from
the
setting
sun
painted
every
hill
one
side
red
as
with
blood
the
other
dark
as
the
shadow
of
death
a
cloud
of
smoke
from
burning
homes
hung
over
the
beautiful
river
even
the
permanent
dwellings
of
the
indians
were
empty
and
all
the
teepees
which
had
dotted
with
their
white
cones
the
west
bank
of
the
minnesota
had
disappeared
here
and
there
were
small
groups
of
warriors
returning
from
their
bloody
work
and
among
them
was
tawasuota
he
looked
long
at
the
spot
where
his
home
had
stood
but
it
was
gone
and
with
it
his
family
ah
the
beautiful
country
of
his
ancestors
he
must
depart
from
it
forever
for
he
knew
now
that
the
white
man
would
occupy
that
land
sadly
he
sang
the
and
made
his
appeal
to
the
great
mystery
excusing
himself
by
the
plea
that
what
he
had
done
had
been
in
the
path
of
duty
there
was
no
glory
in
it
for
him
he
could
wear
no
eagle
feather
nor
could
he
ever
recount
the
deed
it
was
dreadful
to
him
the
thought
that
he
had
fired
upon
an
unarmed
and
helpless
man
the
chief
soldier
followed
the
broad
trail
of
the
fleeing
host
and
after
some
hours
he
came
upon
a
camp
there
were
no
nor
dances
there
as
was
their
wont
after
a
battle
but
a
strange
stillness
reigned
even
the
dogs
scarcely
barked
at
his
approach
everything
seemed
conscious
of
the
awful
carnage
of
the
day
he
stopped
at
a
tent
and
inquired
after
his
beautiful
wife
and
two
little
sons
whom
he
had
already
trained
to
uphold
their
father
s
reputation
but
was
directed
to
his
mother
s
teepee
ah
my
son
my
son
what
have
you
done
cried
his
old
mother
when
she
saw
him
come
in
come
in
let
us
eat
together
once
more
for
i
have
a
foreboding
that
it
is
for
the
last
time
alas
what
have
you
done
tawasuota
silently
entered
the
tent
of
his
widowed
mother
and
his
three
sisters
gave
him
the
place
of
honor
mother
it
is
not
right
to
blame
our
brother
said
the
eldest
he
was
the
chief
s
head
soldier
and
if
he
had
disobeyed
his
orders
he
would
have
been
called
a
coward
that
he
could
not
food
was
handed
him
and
he
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
and
gave
back
the
dish
you
have
not
yet
told
me
where
she
is
and
the
children
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
my
son
my
son
i
have
not
because
it
will
give
you
pain
i
wanted
you
to
eat
first
she
has
been
taken
away
by
her
own
mother
to
faribault
among
the
white
people
i
could
not
persuade
them
to
wait
until
you
came
her
people
are
lovers
of
the
whites
they
have
even
accepted
their
religion
grieved
the
good
old
mother
tawasuota
s
head
dropped
upon
his
chest
and
he
sat
silent
for
a
long
time
the
mother
and
three
sisters
were
also
silent
for
they
knew
how
heavy
his
grief
must
be
at
last
he
spoke
mother
i
am
too
proud
to
desert
the
tribe
now
and
join
my
wife
among
the
white
people
my
may
lie
in
my
behalf
and
say
that
my
hands
are
not
stained
with
blood
but
the
spirits
of
those
who
died
would
rebuke
me
and
the
rebuke
would
be
just
no
i
must
fight
the
whites
until
i
die
and
neither
have
i
fought
without
cause
but
i
must
see
my
sons
once
more
before
i
when
tawasuota
left
his
mother
s
teepee
he
walked
fast
across
the
circle
toward
the
council
lodge
to
see
little
crow
he
drew
his
blanket
closely
about
him
with
his
gun
underneath
the
keen
eye
of
the
wily
chief
detected
the
severe
expression
upon
the
face
of
his
guest
and
he
hastened
to
speak
first
there
are
times
in
the
life
of
every
great
man
when
he
must
face
hardship
and
put
self
aside
for
the
good
of
his
people
you
have
done
well
i
care
little
for
myself
replied
tawasuota
but
my
heart
is
heavy
my
wife
and
two
boys
have
been
taken
away
among
the
whites
by
my
i
fear
for
their
safety
when
it
is
known
what
we
have
ugh
that
old
woman
is
too
hasty
in
accepting
the
ways
of
the
stranger
people
exclaimed
the
chief
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
see
them
declared
tawasuota
ugh
ugh
i
shall
need
you
my
plan
is
to
attack
the
soldiers
at
fort
ridgeley
with
a
strong
force
there
are
not
many
then
we
shall
attack
new
ulm
and
other
towns
we
will
drive
them
all
back
into
saint
paul
and
fort
little
crow
spoke
with
energy
you
must
stay
he
added
and
lead
the
attack
either
at
the
fort
or
at
new
for
some
minutes
the
chief
soldier
sat
in
silence
at
last
he
said
simply
i
will
do
on
the
following
day
the
attack
was
made
but
it
was
unsuccessful
the
whole
state
was
now
alarmed
and
all
the
frontier
settlers
left
alive
had
flocked
to
the
larger
and
more
protected
towns
it
had
also
developed
during
the
day
that
there
was
a
large
party
of
sioux
who
were
ready
to
surrender
thereby
showing
that
they
had
not
been
party
to
the
massacre
nor
indorsed
the
hasty
action
of
the
tribe
at
evening
tawasuota
saw
that
there
would
be
a
long
war
with
the
whites
and
that
the
indians
must
remove
their
families
out
of
danger
the
feeling
against
all
indians
was
great
night
had
brought
him
no
relief
of
mind
but
it
promised
to
shield
him
in
a
hazardous
undertaking
he
consulted
no
one
but
set
out
for
the
distant
village
of
faribault
he
kept
to
the
flats
back
of
the
minnesota
away
from
the
roads
and
moved
on
at
a
good
gait
for
he
realized
that
he
had
to
cover
a
hundred
miles
in
as
few
hours
as
possible
every
day
that
passed
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
rejoin
his
family
although
he
kept
as
far
as
he
could
from
the
settlements
he
would
come
now
and
then
upon
a
solitary
frame
house
razed
to
the
ground
by
the
of
the
day
before
the
members
of
the
family
were
to
be
seen
scattered
in
and
about
the
place
and
their
white
upturned
faces
told
him
that
his
race
must
pay
for
the
deed
the
dog
that
howled
pitifully
over
the
dead
was
often
the
only
survivor
of
the
farmer
s
household
occasionally
tawasuota
heard
at
a
distance
the
wagons
of
the
fugitives
loaded
with
women
and
children
while
armed
men
walked
before
and
behind
these
caravans
were
usually
drawn
by
oxen
and
moved
slowly
toward
some
large
town
when
the
dawn
appeared
in
the
east
the
chief
soldier
was
compelled
to
conceal
himself
in
a
secluded
place
he
rolled
up
in
his
blanket
lay
down
in
a
dry
among
the
red
willows
and
immediately
fell
asleep
with
the
next
evening
he
resumed
his
journey
and
reached
faribault
toward
midnight
even
here
every
approach
was
guarded
against
the
possibility
of
an
indian
attack
but
there
was
much
forest
and
he
knew
the
country
well
he
reconnoitred
and
soon
found
the
indian
community
but
dared
not
approach
and
enter
for
these
indians
had
allied
themselves
with
the
whites
they
would
be
charged
with
treachery
if
it
were
known
that
they
had
received
a
hostile
sioux
and
none
were
so
hated
by
the
white
people
as
little
crow
and
his
he
chose
a
concealed
position
from
which
he
might
watch
the
movements
of
his
wife
if
she
were
indeed
there
and
had
not
been
waylaid
and
slain
on
the
journey
hither
that
night
was
the
hardest
one
that
the
warrior
had
ever
known
if
he
slept
it
was
only
to
dream
of
the
and
attack
but
at
last
he
found
himself
broad
awake
the
sun
well
up
and
yes
there
were
his
two
little
sons
playing
outside
their
teepee
as
of
old
the
next
moment
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
wife
from
the
deep
woods
wailing
for
her
husband
oh
take
us
husband
take
us
with
you
let
us
all
die
together
she
pleaded
as
she
clung
to
him
whom
she
had
regarded
as
already
dead
for
she
knew
of
the
price
that
had
been
put
upon
his
head
and
that
some
of
the
halfbreeds
loved
money
better
than
the
blood
of
their
indian
mothers
tawasuota
stood
for
a
minute
without
speaking
while
his
huge
frame
trembled
like
a
mighty
pine
beneath
the
thunderbolt
no
he
said
at
last
i
shall
go
but
you
must
remain
you
are
a
woman
and
the
white
people
need
not
know
that
your
little
boys
are
mine
bring
them
here
to
me
this
evening
that
i
may
kiss
them
the
sun
was
hovering
among
the
treetops
when
they
met
again
atay
atay
papa
papa
the
little
fellows
cried
out
in
spite
of
her
cautions
but
the
mother
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
they
became
silent
tawasuota
took
each
boy
in
his
arms
and
held
him
close
for
a
few
moments
he
smiled
to
them
but
large
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
then
he
disappeared
in
the
shadows
and
they
never
saw
him
again
the
chief
soldier
lived
and
died
a
warrior
and
an
enemy
to
the
white
man
but
one
of
his
two
sons
became
in
a
minister
of
the
christian
gospel
under
the
praying
man
bishop
whipple
of
minnesota
vi
the
white
man
s
errand
upon
the
wide
tableland
that
lies
at
the
back
of
a
certain
indian
agency
a
camp
of
a
thousand
teepees
was
pitched
in
a
circle
according
to
the
ancient
usage
in
the
center
of
the
circle
stood
the
council
lodge
where
there
were
gathered
together
of
an
afternoon
all
the
men
of
years
and
distinction
some
in
blankets
some
in
uniform
and
still
others
clad
in
beggarly
white
man
s
clothing
but
the
minds
of
all
were
alike
upon
the
days
of
their
youth
and
freedom
around
the
council
fire
they
passed
and
repassed
the
pipe
of
peace
and
when
the
big
drum
was
struck
they
sang
the
accompaniment
with
sad
yet
pleasant
thoughts
of
the
life
that
is
past
between
the
songs
stories
of
brave
deeds
and
dangerous
exploits
were
related
by
the
actors
in
turn
with
as
much
spirit
and
zest
as
if
they
were
still
living
in
those
days
tum
tum
tum
the
drum
was
sounded
oow
oow
they
hooted
in
a
joyous
chorus
at
the
close
of
each
refrain
ho
exclaimed
finally
the
master
of
ceremonies
for
the
evening
it
is
zuyamani
s
story
of
his
great
ride
that
we
should
now
hear
it
was
not
far
from
this
place
upon
the
missouri
river
and
within
the
recollection
of
many
of
us
that
this
occurred
ye
young
men
must
hear
ho
ho
was
the
ready
response
of
all
present
and
the
drum
was
struck
once
according
to
custom
the
pipe
was
filled
and
handed
to
zuyamani
who
gravely
smoked
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
then
he
related
his
contribution
to
the
unwritten
history
of
our
frontier
in
these
words
it
was
during
the
winter
following
that
summer
in
which
general
sibley
pursued
many
of
our
people
across
the
muddy
river
that
we
hunkpatees
friendly
sioux
were
camping
at
a
place
called
about
two
miles
from
fort
rice
dakota
territory
the
chief
soldier
of
the
garrison
called
one
day
upon
the
leading
chiefs
of
our
band
to
each
one
he
said
lend
me
your
bravest
warrior
each
chief
called
his
principal
warriors
together
and
laid
the
matter
before
them
the
chief
soldier
at
this
place
they
explained
wants
to
send
a
message
to
fort
berthold
where
the
rees
and
mandans
live
to
another
chief
soldier
there
the
soldiers
of
the
great
father
do
not
know
the
way
neither
could
any
of
them
get
through
the
lines
he
asks
for
a
brave
man
to
carry
his
the
mandans
and
the
rees
were
our
hereditary
enemies
but
this
was
not
the
principal
reason
for
our
hesitation
we
had
declared
allegiance
to
the
great
father
at
washington
we
had
taken
our
stand
against
the
fighting
men
of
our
own
nation
and
the
hostile
sioux
were
worse
than
enemies
to
us
at
this
time
each
chief
had
only
called
on
his
leading
warriors
and
each
in
turn
reported
his
failure
to
secure
a
volunteer
then
the
chief
soldier
sent
again
and
said
is
there
not
a
young
man
among
you
who
dares
to
face
death
if
he
reaches
the
fort
with
my
message
he
will
need
to
be
as
well
as
brave
and
the
great
father
will
not
forget
him
now
all
the
chiefs
together
called
all
the
young
men
in
a
great
council
and
submitted
to
them
the
demand
of
the
great
father
s
servant
we
knew
well
that
the
country
between
us
and
fort
berthold
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
distant
was
alive
with
hostile
sioux
and
that
if
any
of
us
should
be
caught
and
recognized
by
them
he
would
surely
be
put
to
death
it
would
not
be
easy
to
deceive
them
by
professing
hostility
to
the
government
for
the
record
of
each
individual
indian
is
well
known
the
warriors
were
still
unwilling
to
go
for
they
argued
thus
this
is
a
white
man
s
errand
and
will
not
be
recorded
as
a
brave
deed
upon
the
honor
roll
of
our
i
think
many
would
have
volunteered
but
for
that
belief
at
that
time
we
had
not
a
high
opinion
of
the
white
man
since
all
the
rest
were
silent
it
came
into
my
mind
to
offer
my
services
the
warriors
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
for
i
was
a
very
young
man
and
had
no
experience
our
chief
two
bears
who
was
my
own
uncle
finally
presented
my
name
to
the
commanding
officer
he
praised
my
courage
and
begged
me
to
be
vigilant
the
interpreter
told
him
that
i
had
never
been
upon
the
and
would
be
knocked
over
like
a
rabbit
but
as
no
one
else
would
go
he
was
obliged
to
accept
me
as
his
messenger
he
gave
me
a
fine
horse
and
saddle
also
a
rifle
and
soldier
s
uniform
i
would
not
take
the
gun
nor
wear
the
blue
coat
i
accepted
only
a
revolver
and
i
took
my
bow
and
quiver
full
of
arrows
and
wore
my
usual
dress
i
hid
the
letter
in
my
moccasin
i
set
out
before
daybreak
the
next
morning
the
snow
was
deep
i
rode
up
the
river
on
the
west
bank
keeping
a
very
close
watch
all
the
way
but
seeing
nothing
i
had
been
provided
with
a
pair
of
field
glasses
and
i
surveyed
the
country
on
all
sides
from
the
top
of
every
hill
having
traveled
all
day
and
part
of
the
night
i
rested
my
horse
and
i
took
a
little
sleep
after
eating
a
small
quantity
of
pemmican
i
made
a
very
early
start
in
the
morning
it
was
scarcely
light
when
i
headed
for
a
ridge
from
which
to
survey
the
country
beyond
just
as
i
ascended
the
rise
i
found
myself
almost
surrounded
by
loose
ponies
evidently
belonging
to
a
winter
camp
of
the
hostile
sioux
i
readjusted
my
saddle
tightened
the
girths
and
prepared
to
ride
swiftly
around
the
camp
i
saw
some
men
already
out
after
ponies
no
one
appeared
to
have
seen
me
as
yet
but
i
felt
that
as
soon
as
it
became
lighter
they
could
not
help
observing
me
i
turned
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
camp
which
was
a
very
large
one
and
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
timbered
bottom
lands
i
began
to
congratulate
myself
that
i
had
not
been
seen
as
i
entered
the
woods
at
the
crossing
of
a
dry
creek
i
noticed
that
my
horse
was
nervous
i
knew
that
horses
are
quick
to
discover
animals
or
men
by
scent
and
i
became
nervous
too
the
animal
put
his
four
feet
together
and
almost
slid
down
the
steep
bank
as
he
came
out
on
the
opposite
side
he
swerved
suddenly
and
started
to
run
then
i
saw
a
man
watching
me
from
behind
a
tree
fortunately
for
me
he
carried
no
weapon
he
was
out
after
ponies
and
had
only
a
lariat
wound
upon
one
shoulder
he
beckoned
and
made
signs
for
me
to
stop
but
i
spurred
my
horse
and
took
flight
at
once
i
could
hear
him
yelling
far
behind
me
no
doubt
to
arouse
the
camp
and
set
them
on
my
trail
as
i
fled
westward
i
came
upon
another
man
mounted
and
driving
his
ponies
before
him
he
yelled
and
hooted
in
vain
then
turned
and
rode
after
me
two
others
had
started
in
pursuit
but
my
horse
was
a
good
one
and
i
easily
outdistanced
them
at
the
start
after
i
had
fairly
circled
the
camp
i
turned
again
toward
the
river
hoping
to
regain
the
bottom
lands
the
traveling
was
bad
sometimes
we
came
to
deep
gulches
filled
with
snow
where
my
horse
would
sink
in
up
to
his
body
and
seem
unable
to
move
when
i
jumped
off
his
back
and
struck
him
once
or
twice
he
would
make
several
desperate
leaps
and
recover
his
footing
my
pursuers
were
equally
hindered
but
by
this
time
the
pursuit
was
general
and
in
order
to
terrify
me
they
yelled
continually
and
fired
their
guns
into
the
air
now
and
then
i
came
to
a
gulch
which
i
had
to
follow
up
in
search
of
a
place
to
cross
and
at
such
times
they
gained
on
me
i
began
to
despair
for
i
knew
that
the
white
man
s
horses
have
not
the
endurance
of
our
indian
ponies
and
i
expected
to
be
chased
most
of
the
day
finally
i
came
to
a
ravine
that
seemed
impossible
to
cross
as
i
followed
it
up
it
became
evident
that
some
of
them
had
known
of
this
trap
and
had
cut
in
ahead
of
me
i
felt
that
i
must
soon
abandon
my
horse
and
slide
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
gulch
to
save
myself
however
i
made
one
last
effort
to
pass
my
enemies
they
came
within
gunshot
and
several
fired
at
me
although
all
our
horses
were
going
at
full
speed
they
missed
me
and
being
at
last
clear
of
them
i
came
to
a
place
where
i
could
cross
and
the
pursuit
when
zuyamani
reached
this
point
in
his
recital
the
great
drum
was
struck
several
times
and
all
the
men
cheered
him
the
days
are
short
in
winter
he
went
on
after
a
short
pause
and
just
now
the
sun
sank
behind
the
hills
i
did
not
linger
i
continued
my
journey
by
night
and
reached
fort
berthold
before
midnight
i
had
been
so
thoroughly
frightened
and
was
so
much
exhausted
that
i
did
not
want
to
talk
and
as
soon
as
i
had
delivered
my
letters
to
the
post
commander
i
went
to
the
interpreter
s
quarters
to
sleep
the
interpreter
however
announced
my
arrival
and
that
same
night
many
ree
gros
ventre
and
mandan
warriors
came
to
call
upon
me
among
them
was
a
great
chief
of
the
rees
called
poor
dog
you
must
be
said
he
to
me
either
a
very
young
man
or
a
fool
you
have
not
told
us
about
your
close
escape
but
a
runner
came
in
at
dusk
and
told
us
of
the
pursuit
he
reported
that
you
had
been
killed
by
the
hostiles
for
he
heard
many
guns
fired
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
these
white
men
will
never
give
you
any
credit
for
your
wonderful
ride
nor
will
they
compensate
you
for
the
risks
you
have
taken
in
their
service
they
will
not
give
you
so
much
as
one
eagle
feather
for
what
you
have
done
the
next
day
i
was
sent
for
to
go
to
headquarters
and
there
i
related
my
pursuit
by
the
hostile
sioux
the
commanding
officer
advised
me
to
remain
at
the
fort
fifteen
days
before
making
the
return
trip
thinking
that
by
that
time
my
enemies
might
cease
to
look
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
wrote
his
letters
and
i
told
him
that
i
was
ready
to
start
i
will
give
you
he
said
twenty
rees
and
gros
ventres
to
escort
you
past
the
hostile
we
set
out
very
early
and
rode
all
day
so
that
night
overtook
us
just
before
we
reached
the
camp
at
nightfall
we
sent
two
scouts
ahead
but
before
they
left
us
they
took
the
oath
of
the
pipe
in
token
of
their
loyalty
you
all
know
the
ancient
war
custom
a
lighted
pipe
was
held
toward
them
and
each
one
solemnly
touched
it
after
which
it
was
passed
as
usual
we
followed
more
slowly
and
at
about
midnight
we
came
to
the
place
where
our
scouts
had
agreed
to
meet
us
they
were
to
return
from
a
reconnaissance
of
the
camp
and
report
on
what
they
had
seen
it
was
a
lonely
spot
and
the
night
was
very
cold
and
still
we
sat
there
in
the
snowy
woods
near
a
little
creek
and
smoked
in
silence
while
we
waited
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
reflect
upon
my
position
these
gros
ventres
and
rees
have
been
our
enemies
for
generations
i
was
one
man
to
twenty
they
had
their
orders
from
the
commander
of
the
fort
and
that
was
my
only
safeguard
soon
we
heard
the
howl
of
a
wolf
a
little
to
the
westward
immediately
one
of
the
party
answered
in
the
same
manner
i
could
not
have
told
it
from
the
howl
of
a
real
wolf
then
we
heard
a
hooting
owl
down
the
creek
another
of
our
party
hooted
like
an
owl
presently
the
wolf
s
voice
sounded
nearer
while
the
owl
s
hoot
came
nearer
in
the
opposite
direction
then
we
heard
the
footsteps
of
ponies
on
the
crisp
frosty
air
the
scout
who
had
been
imitating
the
wolf
came
in
first
and
the
owl
soon
followed
the
warriors
made
a
ring
and
again
filled
the
pipe
and
the
scouts
took
the
oath
for
the
second
time
after
smoking
they
reported
a
trail
going
up
a
stream
tributary
to
the
missouri
but
whether
going
out
or
coming
in
it
was
impossible
to
tell
in
the
dark
it
was
several
days
old
this
was
discussed
for
some
time
the
question
was
whether
some
had
gone
out
in
search
of
meat
or
whether
some
additional
men
had
come
into
camp
the
bunch
of
stars
was
already
a
little
west
of
the
middle
sky
when
we
set
out
again
they
agreed
to
take
me
a
short
distance
beyond
this
creek
and
there
leave
me
as
they
were
afraid
to
go
any
further
on
the
bank
of
the
creek
we
took
a
farewell
smoke
there
was
a
faint
glow
in
the
east
showing
that
it
was
almost
morning
the
warriors
sang
a
strong
heart
song
for
me
in
an
undertone
as
i
went
on
alone
i
tried
to
make
a
wide
circuit
of
the
camp
but
i
passed
their
ponies
grazing
all
over
the
side
hills
at
a
considerable
distance
and
i
went
as
quietly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
frighten
them
when
i
had
fairly
passed
the
camp
i
came
down
to
the
road
again
and
i
let
my
horse
fly
i
had
been
cautioned
at
the
post
that
the
crossings
of
the
creeks
on
either
side
of
the
camp
were
the
most
dangerous
places
since
they
would
be
likely
to
watch
for
me
there
i
had
left
the
second
crossing
far
behind
and
i
felt
quite
safe
but
i
was
tired
and
chilled
by
the
long
ride
my
horse
too
began
to
show
signs
of
fatigue
in
a
deep
ravine
where
there
was
plenty
of
dry
wood
and
shelter
i
cleared
the
ground
of
snow
and
kindled
a
small
fire
then
i
gave
the
horse
his
last
ration
of
oats
and
i
ate
the
last
of
the
pemmican
that
the
ree
scouts
had
given
me
suddenly
he
pricked
up
his
ears
in
the
direction
of
home
he
ate
a
mouthful
and
listened
again
i
began
to
grow
nervous
and
i
listened
too
soon
i
heard
the
footsteps
of
horses
in
the
snow
at
a
considerable
distance
hastily
i
mounted
and
took
flight
along
the
ravine
until
i
had
to
come
out
upon
the
open
plain
in
full
view
of
a
party
of
about
thirty
sioux
in
coming
back
from
the
direction
of
fort
rice
they
immediately
gave
chase
yelling
and
flourishing
their
guns
and
tomahawks
over
their
heads
i
urged
my
horse
to
his
best
speed
for
i
felt
that
if
they
should
overtake
me
nothing
could
save
me
my
friend
white
elk
here
was
one
of
that
warparty
i
saw
that
i
had
a
fair
lead
and
the
best
horse
and
was
gaining
upon
them
when
about
two
miles
out
i
met
some
more
of
the
party
who
had
lingered
behind
the
rest
i
was
surrounded
i
turned
toward
the
north
to
a
deep
gulch
that
i
knew
i
should
find
there
and
i
led
my
horse
along
a
narrow
and
slippery
ridge
to
a
deep
hole
here
i
took
up
my
position
i
guarded
the
pass
with
my
bow
and
arrows
and
they
could
not
reach
me
unless
they
should
follow
the
ridge
in
single
file
i
knew
that
they
would
not
storm
my
position
for
that
is
not
the
indian
way
of
fighting
but
i
supposed
that
they
would
try
to
tire
me
out
they
yelled
and
hooted
and
shot
many
bullets
and
arrows
over
my
head
to
terrify
me
into
surrender
but
i
remained
motionless
and
silent
night
came
with
a
full
round
moon
all
was
light
as
day
except
the
place
where
i
stood
half
frozen
and
not
daring
to
move
the
bottom
of
the
gulch
was
as
black
as
a
well
and
almost
as
cold
the
wolves
howled
all
around
me
in
the
stillness
at
last
i
heard
the
footsteps
of
horses
retreating
and
then
no
other
sound
still
i
dared
not
come
out
i
must
have
slept
for
it
was
dawn
when
i
seemed
to
hear
faintly
the
yelling
of
warriors
and
then
i
heard
my
own
name
zuyamani
tokiya
nunka
huwo
where
are
you
zuyamani
they
shouted
a
party
of
my
friends
had
come
out
to
meet
me
and
had
followed
our
trail
i
was
scarcely
able
to
walk
when
i
came
out
but
they
filled
the
pipe
and
held
it
up
to
me
as
is
done
in
recognition
of
distinguished
service
they
escorted
me
into
the
post
singing
war
songs
and
songs
of
brave
deeds
and
there
i
delivered
up
his
letters
to
the
chief
again
the
drum
was
struck
and
the
old
men
cheered
zuyamani
who
added
i
think
that
poor
dog
was
right
for
the
great
father
never
gave
me
any
credit
nor
did
he
ever
reward
me
for
what
i
had
done
yet
i
have
not
been
without
honor
for
my
own
people
have
not
forgotten
me
even
though
i
went
upon
the
white
man
s
vii
the
grave
of
the
dog
the
full
moon
was
just
clear
of
the
high
mountain
ranges
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
bluish
haze
it
looked
almost
as
if
it
were
frozen
against
the
impalpable
blueblack
of
the
reckless
midwinter
sky
the
game
scout
moved
slowly
homeward
well
wrapped
in
his
long
buffalo
robe
which
was
securely
belted
to
his
strong
loins
his
quiver
tightly
tied
to
his
shoulders
so
as
not
to
impede
his
progress
it
was
enough
to
carry
upon
his
feet
two
strong
for
the
snow
was
deep
and
its
crust
too
thin
to
bear
his
weight
as
he
emerged
from
the
lowlands
into
the
upper
regions
he
loomed
up
a
gigantic
figure
against
the
clear
moonlit
horizon
his
picturesque
foxskin
cap
with
all
its
trimmings
was
incrusted
with
frost
from
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
and
his
lagging
footfall
sounded
crisply
the
distance
he
had
that
day
covered
was
enough
for
any
human
endurance
yet
he
was
neither
faint
nor
hungry
but
his
feet
were
frozen
into
the
psay
the
so
that
he
could
not
run
faster
than
an
easy
slip
and
slide
at
last
he
reached
the
point
the
crown
of
the
last
ascent
and
when
he
smelled
fire
and
the
savory
odor
of
the
jerked
buffalo
meat
it
caused
him
to
waver
but
he
must
not
fail
to
follow
the
custom
of
untold
ages
and
give
the
game
scout
s
wolf
call
before
entering
camp
accordingly
he
paused
upon
the
highest
point
of
the
ridge
and
uttered
a
cry
to
which
the
hungry
cry
of
a
real
wolf
would
have
seemed
but
a
coyote
s
yelp
in
comparison
then
it
was
that
the
rest
of
the
buffalo
hunters
knew
that
their
game
scout
was
returning
with
welcome
news
for
the
unsuccessful
scout
enters
the
camp
silently
a
second
time
he
gave
the
call
to
assure
his
hearers
that
their
ears
did
not
deceive
them
the
gray
wolves
received
the
news
with
perfect
understanding
it
meant
food
came
from
all
directions
especially
from
the
opposite
ridge
thus
the
ghostly
cold
weird
night
was
enlivened
with
the
music
from
many
wild
throats
down
the
gradual
slope
the
scout
hastened
his
footfall
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
after
the
answers
to
his
call
had
ceased
as
he
crossed
a
little
ridge
an
immense
wolf
suddenly
confronted
him
and
instead
of
retreating
calmly
sat
up
and
gazed
steadfastly
into
his
face
welcome
welcome
friend
the
hunter
spoke
as
he
passed
in
the
meantime
the
hunters
at
the
temporary
camp
were
aroused
to
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
some
turned
their
buffalo
robes
and
put
them
on
in
such
a
way
as
to
convert
themselves
into
bison
and
began
to
tread
the
snow
while
others
were
singing
the
buffalo
song
that
their
spirits
might
be
charmed
and
allured
within
the
circle
of
the
the
scout
too
was
singing
his
buffalo
bull
song
in
a
guttural
lowing
chant
as
he
neared
the
hunting
camp
within
he
paused
again
while
the
usual
ceremonies
were
enacted
for
his
reception
this
done
he
was
seated
with
the
leaders
in
a
chosen
place
it
was
a
long
run
he
said
but
there
were
no
difficulties
i
found
the
first
herd
directly
north
of
here
the
second
herd
a
great
one
is
northeast
near
shell
lake
the
snow
is
deep
the
buffalo
can
only
follow
their
leader
in
their
hi
hi
hi
the
hunters
exclaimed
solemnly
in
token
of
gratitude
raising
their
hands
heavenward
and
then
pointing
them
toward
the
ground
ho
kola
one
more
round
of
the
then
we
shall
retire
to
rise
before
daybreak
for
the
hunt
advised
one
of
the
leaders
silently
they
partook
in
turn
of
the
pipe
and
one
by
one
with
a
dignified
ho
departed
to
their
teepees
the
scout
betook
himself
to
his
little
old
buffalo
teepee
which
he
used
for
winter
hunting
expeditions
his
faithful
shunka
who
had
been
all
this
time
its
only
occupant
met
him
at
the
entrance
as
dogs
alone
know
how
to
welcome
a
lifelong
friend
as
his
master
entered
he
stretched
himself
in
his
way
from
the
tip
of
his
tail
to
that
of
his
tongue
and
finished
by
curling
both
ends
upward
ho
mita
shunka
eat
this
for
you
must
be
hungry
so
saying
the
scout
laid
before
his
canine
friend
the
last
piece
of
his
dried
buffalo
meat
it
was
the
sweetest
meal
ever
eaten
by
a
dog
judging
by
his
long
smacking
of
his
lips
after
he
had
swallowed
it
the
hunting
party
was
soon
lost
in
heavy
slumber
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
save
the
gnawing
of
the
ponies
upon
the
cottonwood
bark
which
was
provided
for
them
instead
of
hay
in
the
winter
time
all
about
shell
lake
the
bison
were
gathered
in
great
herds
the
unmistakable
signs
of
the
sky
had
warned
them
of
approaching
bad
weather
the
moon
s
robe
was
girdled
with
the
rainbow
wampum
of
heaven
the
very
music
of
the
snow
under
their
feet
had
given
them
warning
on
the
north
side
of
shell
lake
there
were
several
deep
gulches
which
were
the
homes
of
every
wanderer
of
the
plains
at
such
a
time
at
this
when
there
was
a
change
toward
severe
weather
all
the
people
headed
for
this
lake
here
was
a
heavy
growth
of
reeds
rushes
and
coarse
grass
making
good
shelters
and
also
springs
which
afforded
water
after
the
lake
was
frozen
solid
hence
great
numbers
of
the
bison
had
gathered
here
when
wapashaw
the
game
scout
had
rolled
himself
in
his
warm
buffalo
robe
and
was
sound
asleep
his
faithful
companion
hunter
the
great
esquimaux
wolf
dog
silently
rose
and
again
stretched
himself
then
stood
quiet
for
a
moment
as
if
meditating
it
was
clear
that
he
knew
well
what
he
had
planned
to
do
but
was
considering
how
he
should
do
it
without
arousing
any
suspicion
of
his
movements
this
is
a
dog
s
art
and
the
night
tricks
and
marauding
must
always
be
the
joy
and
secret
of
his
life
softly
he
emerged
from
the
lodge
and
gave
a
sweeping
glance
around
to
assure
him
that
there
were
none
to
spy
upon
him
suspiciously
he
sniffed
the
air
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
there
could
be
any
danger
to
his
sleeping
master
while
he
should
be
away
his
purpose
was
still
a
secret
it
may
be
that
it
was
not
entirely
a
selfish
one
or
merely
the
satisfying
of
his
inherited
traits
having
fully
convinced
himself
of
the
safety
of
the
unguarded
camp
he
went
forth
into
the
biting
cold
the
moon
was
now
well
up
on
the
prairies
of
the
sky
there
were
no
cloud
hills
in
the
blue
field
above
to
conceal
her
from
view
her
brilliant
light
set
on
fire
every
snow
gem
upon
the
plains
and
hillsides
about
the
hunters
camp
up
the
long
ascent
he
trotted
in
a
northerly
direction
yet
not
following
his
master
s
trail
he
was
large
and
formidable
in
strength
combining
the
features
of
his
wild
brothers
of
the
plains
with
those
of
the
dogs
who
keep
company
with
the
red
men
his
hair
and
sharp
ears
and
nose
appeared
to
immense
advantage
against
the
spotless
and
jeweled
snow
until
presently
his
own
warm
breath
had
coated
him
with
heavy
frost
after
a
time
shunka
struck
into
his
master
s
trail
and
followed
it
all
the
way
only
taking
a
short
cut
here
and
there
when
by
dog
instinct
he
knew
that
a
man
must
go
around
such
a
point
to
get
to
his
destination
he
met
many
travelers
during
the
night
but
none
had
dared
to
approach
him
though
some
few
followed
at
a
distance
as
if
to
discover
his
purpose
at
last
he
reached
shell
lake
and
there
beheld
a
great
gathering
of
the
herds
they
stood
in
groups
like
enormous
rocks
no
longer
black
but
white
with
frost
every
one
of
them
emitted
a
white
steam
quickly
frozen
into
a
fine
snow
in
the
air
shunka
sat
upon
his
haunches
and
gazed
wough
this
is
it
he
said
to
himself
he
had
kept
still
when
the
game
scout
gave
the
wolf
call
though
the
camp
was
in
an
uproar
and
from
the
adjacent
hills
the
wild
hunters
were
equally
joyous
because
they
understood
the
meaning
of
the
unwonted
noise
yet
his
curiosity
was
not
fully
satisfied
and
he
had
set
out
to
discover
the
truth
and
it
may
be
to
protect
or
serve
his
master
in
case
of
danger
at
daybreak
the
great
dog
meekly
entered
his
master
s
rude
teepee
and
found
him
already
preparing
for
the
prospective
hunt
he
was
filling
his
inside
moccasins
full
of
buffalo
hair
to
serve
as
stockings
over
which
he
put
on
his
large
buffalo
moccasins
with
the
hair
inside
and
adjusted
his
warm
leggings
he
then
adjusted
his
snowshoes
and
filled
his
quiver
full
of
good
arrows
the
dog
quietly
lay
down
in
a
warm
place
making
himself
as
small
as
possible
as
if
to
escape
observation
and
calmly
watched
his
master
ho
ho
ho
kola
enakanee
enakanee
shouted
the
game
herald
it
is
always
best
to
get
the
game
early
then
their
spirits
can
take
flight
with
the
coming
of
a
new
day
all
had
now
donned
their
there
was
no
food
left
therefore
no
delay
to
prepare
breakfast
it
is
very
propitious
for
our
hunt
one
exclaimed
everything
is
in
our
favor
there
is
a
good
crust
on
the
snow
and
the
promise
of
a
good
clear
day
soon
all
the
hunters
were
running
in
single
file
upon
the
trail
of
the
scout
each
indian
closely
followed
by
his
trusty
hunting
dog
in
less
than
two
hours
they
stood
just
back
of
the
low
ridge
which
rounded
the
south
side
of
shell
lake
the
narrow
strip
of
land
between
its
twin
divisions
was
literally
filled
with
the
bison
in
the
gulches
beyond
between
the
dark
lines
of
timber
there
were
also
scattered
groups
but
the
hunters
at
once
saw
their
advantage
over
the
herd
upon
the
peninsula
hechetu
kola
this
is
well
friends
exclaimed
the
first
to
speak
these
can
be
forced
to
cross
the
slippery
ice
and
the
mire
around
the
springs
this
will
help
us
to
get
more
meat
our
people
are
hungry
and
we
must
kill
many
in
order
to
feed
them
ho
ho
ho
agreed
all
the
hunters
and
it
is
here
that
we
can
use
our
companion
hunters
best
for
the
shunkas
will
intimidate
and
bewilder
the
buffalo
women
said
an
old
man
ugh
he
is
always
right
our
dogs
must
help
us
here
the
meat
will
be
theirs
as
well
as
ours
another
added
tosh
kola
the
game
scout
s
dog
is
the
greatest
shunka
of
them
all
he
has
a
mind
near
like
that
of
a
man
let
him
lead
the
attack
of
his
fellows
while
we
crawl
up
on
the
opposite
side
and
surround
the
buffalo
upon
the
slippery
ice
and
in
the
deceitful
mire
spoke
up
a
third
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
game
scout
and
his
shunka
should
lead
the
attack
of
the
dogs
woo
woo
woo
was
the
hoarse
signal
from
the
throat
of
the
game
scout
but
his
voice
was
drowned
by
the
howling
and
barking
of
the
savage
dogs
as
they
made
their
charge
in
a
moment
all
was
confusion
among
the
buffalo
some
started
this
way
others
that
and
the
great
mass
swayed
to
and
fro
uncertainly
a
few
were
ready
to
fight
but
the
snow
was
too
deep
for
a
countercharge
upon
the
dogs
save
on
the
ice
just
in
front
of
them
where
the
wind
had
always
full
sweep
there
all
was
slippery
and
shining
in
their
excitement
and
confusion
the
bison
rushed
upon
this
uncertain
plain
their
weight
and
the
momentum
of
their
rush
carried
them
hopelessly
far
out
where
they
were
again
confused
as
to
which
way
to
go
and
many
were
stuck
in
the
mire
which
was
concealed
by
the
snow
except
here
and
there
an
opening
above
a
spring
from
which
there
issued
a
steaming
vapor
the
game
scout
and
his
valiant
dog
led
on
the
force
of
canines
with
deafening
and
one
could
see
black
heads
here
and
there
popping
from
behind
the
embankments
as
the
herd
finally
swept
toward
the
opposite
shore
many
dead
were
left
behind
pierced
by
the
arrows
of
the
hunters
they
lay
like
black
mounds
upon
the
glassy
plain
it
was
a
great
hunt
once
more
the
camp
will
be
fed
they
thought
and
this
good
fortune
will
help
us
to
reach
the
spring
alive
a
chant
of
rejoicing
rang
out
from
the
opposite
shore
while
the
game
scout
unsheathed
his
big
knife
and
began
the
work
which
is
ever
the
sequel
of
the
hunt
to
dress
the
game
although
the
survivors
of
the
slaughter
had
scarcely
disappeared
behind
the
hills
the
dogs
had
all
run
back
to
their
respective
masters
and
this
left
the
scout
and
his
companion
shunka
alone
some
were
appointed
to
start
a
camp
in
a
neighboring
gulch
among
the
trees
so
that
the
hunters
might
bring
their
meat
there
and
eat
before
setting
out
for
the
great
camp
on
the
big
river
all
were
busily
skinning
and
cutting
up
the
meat
into
pieces
convenient
for
carrying
when
suddenly
a
hunter
called
the
attention
of
those
near
him
to
an
ominous
change
in
the
atmosphere
there
are
signs
of
a
blizzard
we
must
hurry
into
the
near
woods
before
it
reaches
us
he
shouted
some
heard
him
others
did
not
those
who
saw
or
heard
passed
on
the
signal
and
hurried
toward
the
wood
where
others
had
already
arranged
rude
shelters
and
gathered
piles
of
dry
wood
for
fuel
around
the
several
the
hunters
sat
or
stood
while
slices
of
savory
meat
were
broiled
and
eaten
with
a
relish
by
the
men
ho
kola
eat
this
friend
said
they
to
one
another
as
one
finished
broiling
a
steak
of
the
bison
and
offered
it
to
his
neighbor
but
the
storm
had
now
fairly
enveloped
them
in
whirling
whiteness
woo
woo
they
called
to
those
who
had
not
yet
reached
camp
one
after
another
answered
and
emerged
from
the
blinding
pall
of
snow
at
last
none
were
missing
save
the
game
scout
and
his
shunka
the
hunters
passed
the
time
in
eating
and
telling
stories
until
a
late
hour
occasionally
giving
a
united
shout
to
guide
the
lost
one
should
he
chance
to
pass
near
their
camp
fear
not
for
our
scout
friends
finally
exclaimed
a
leader
among
them
he
is
a
brave
and
experienced
man
he
will
find
a
safe
and
join
us
when
the
wind
ceases
to
so
they
all
wrapped
themselves
in
their
robes
and
lay
down
to
sleep
all
that
night
and
the
following
day
it
was
impossible
to
give
succor
and
the
hunters
felt
much
concern
for
the
absent
late
in
the
second
night
the
great
storm
subsided
ho
ho
iyotanka
rise
up
so
the
first
hunter
to
awaken
aroused
all
the
others
as
after
every
other
storm
it
was
wonderfully
still
so
still
that
one
could
hear
distinctly
the
pounding
feet
of
the
coming
down
over
the
slopes
to
the
willows
for
food
all
dry
vegetation
was
buried
beneath
the
deep
snow
and
everywhere
they
saw
this
creature
of
the
prairie
coming
down
to
the
woods
now
the
air
was
full
of
the
wolf
and
coyote
game
call
and
they
were
seen
in
great
numbers
upon
the
ice
see
see
the
hungry
wolves
are
dragging
the
carcasses
away
harken
to
the
war
cries
of
the
scout
s
shunka
hurry
hurry
they
urged
one
another
in
chorus
away
they
ran
and
out
upon
the
lake
now
upon
the
ice
now
upon
the
crusted
snow
running
when
they
could
sliding
when
they
must
there
was
certainly
a
great
concourse
of
the
wolves
whirling
in
frantic
circles
but
continually
moving
toward
the
farther
end
of
the
lake
they
could
hear
distinctly
the
hoarse
bark
of
the
scout
s
shunka
and
occasionally
the
muffled
of
a
man
as
if
it
came
from
under
the
ice
as
they
approached
nearer
the
scene
they
could
hear
more
distinctly
the
voice
of
their
friend
but
still
as
it
were
from
underground
when
they
reached
the
spot
to
which
the
wolves
had
dragged
two
of
the
carcasses
of
the
buffalo
shunka
was
seen
to
stand
by
one
of
them
but
at
that
moment
he
staggered
and
fell
the
hunters
took
out
their
knives
and
ripped
up
the
frozen
hide
covering
the
abdominal
cavity
it
revealed
a
warm
nest
of
hay
and
buffalo
hair
in
which
the
scout
lay
wrapped
in
his
own
robe
he
had
placed
his
dog
in
one
of
the
carcasses
and
himself
in
another
for
protection
from
the
storm
but
the
dog
was
wiser
than
the
man
for
he
kept
his
entrance
open
the
man
lapped
the
hide
over
and
it
froze
solidly
shutting
him
securely
in
when
the
hungry
wolves
came
shunka
promptly
extricated
himself
and
held
them
off
as
long
as
he
could
meanwhile
sliding
and
pulling
the
wolves
continued
to
drag
over
the
slippery
ice
the
body
of
the
buffalo
in
which
his
master
had
taken
refuge
the
poor
faithful
dog
with
no
care
for
his
own
safety
stood
by
his
imprisoned
master
until
the
hunters
came
up
but
it
was
too
late
for
he
had
received
more
than
one
mortal
wound
as
soon
as
the
scout
got
out
with
a
face
more
anxious
for
another
than
for
himself
he
exclaimed
where
is
shunka
the
bravest
of
his
tribe
ho
kola
it
is
so
indeed
and
here
he
lies
replied
one
sadly
his
master
knelt
by
his
side
gently
stroking
the
face
of
the
dog
ah
my
friend
you
go
where
all
spirits
live
the
great
mystery
has
a
home
for
every
living
creature
may
he
permit
our
meeting
there
at
daybreak
the
scout
carried
him
up
to
one
of
the
pretty
round
hills
overlooking
the
lake
and
built
up
around
him
walls
of
loose
stone
red
paints
were
scattered
over
the
snow
in
accordance
with
indian
custom
and
the
farewell
song
was
sung
since
that
day
the
place
has
been
known
to
the
sioux
as

declares
the
old
grandmother
as
she
receives
and
critically
examines
the
tiny
bit
of
humanity
there
is
no
remark
as
to
the
color
of
its
hair
or
eyes
both
so
black
as
almost
to
be
blue
but
the
old
woman
scans
sharply
the
delicate
profile
of
the
baby
face
ah
she
has
the
nose
of
her
ancestors
lips
thin
as

the
first
stage
of
the
indian
s
christening
presently
she
is
folded
into
a
soft
white
doeskin
well
lined
with
the
loose
down
of
cattails
and
snugly
laced
into
an
upright
oaken
cradle
the
front
of
which
is
a
richly
embroidered
buckskin
bag
with
porcupine
quills
and
deers
hoofs
suspended
from
its
profuse
fringes
this
gay
cradle
is
strapped
upon
the
second
grandmother
s
back
and
that
dignitary
walks
off
with
the
newcomer
you
must
come
with
me
she
says
we
shall
go
among
the
father
and
mother
trees
and
hear
them
speak
with
their
thousand
tongues
that
you
may
know
their
language
forever
i
will
hang
the
cradle
of
the
upon
utuhu
the
oak
and
she
shall
hear
the
of
the
pine
maiden
in
this
fashion
winona
is
introduced
to
nature
and
becomes
at
once
in
accord
with
the
beliefs
and
practices
of
the
wild
red
man
here
she
is
take
her
says
the
old
woman
on
her
return
from
the
woods
she
presents
the
child
to
its
mother
who
is
sitting
in
the
shade
of
an
as
quietly
as
if
she
had
not
just
passed
through
woman
s
severest
ordeal
in
giving
a
daughter
to
the
brave
chetonska
she
has
a
winsome
face
as
meek
and
innocent
as
the
face
of
an
ermine
graciously
adds
the
grandmother
the
mother
does
not
speak
silently
and
almost
reverently
she
takes
her
new
and
daughter
into
her
arms
she
gazes
into
its
velvety
little
face
of
a
dusky
red
tint
and
unconsciously
presses
the
closely
swaddled
form
to
her
breast
she
feels
the
seize
upon
her
strongly
for
the
first
time
here
is
a
new
life
a
new
hope
a
possible
link
between
herself
and
a
new
race
ah
a
smile
plays
upon
her
lips
as
she
realizes
that
she
has
kissed
her
child
in
its
eyes
and
mouth
she
discerns
clearly
the
features
she
has
loved
in
the
strong
countenance
of
another
though
in
the
little
woman
s
face
they
are
softened
and
retouched
by
the
hand
of
the
great
the
baby
girl
is
called
winona
for
some
months
when
the
is
summoned
and
requested
to
name
publicly
the
daughter
of
chetonska
the
white
hawk
but
not
until
he
has
received
a
present
of
a
good
pony
with
a
finely
painted
it
is
usual
to
confer
another
name
besides
that
of
the
which
may
be
resumed
later
if
the
maiden
proves
worthy
the
name
winona
implies
much
of
honor
it
means
charitable
kind
helpful
all
that
an
eldest
sister
should
be
the
herald
goes
around
the
ring
of
lodges
announcing
in
singsong
fashion
the
christening
and
inviting
everybody
to
a
feast
in
honor
of
the
event
a
real
american
christening
is
always
a
gala
occasion
when
much
savage
wealth
is
distributed
among
the
poor
and
old
people
winona
has
only
just
walked
and
this
fact
is
also
announced
with
additional
gifts
a
wellborn
child
is
ever
before
the
tribal
eye
and
in
the
tribal
ear
as
every
little
step
in
its
progress
toward
manhood
or
womanhood

of
walking
or
swimming

and

a
boy

of
moccasins
made

a
girl
is
announced
publicly
with
feasting
and
the
giving
of
presents
so
winona
receives
her
individual
name
of
tatiyopa
or
her
door
it
is
symbolic
like
most
indian
names
and
implies
that
the
door
of
the
bearer
is
hospitable
and
her
home
attractive
the
two
grandmothers
who
have
carried
the
little
maiden
upon
their
backs
now
tell
and
sing
to
her
by
turns
all
the
legends
of
their
most
noted
female
ancestors
from
the
twin
sisters
of
the
old
story
the
maidens
who
married
among
the
star
people
of
the
sky
down
to
their
own
mothers
all
her
lullabies
are
feminine
and
designed
to
impress
upon
her
tender
mind
the
life
and
duties
of
her
sex
as
soon
as
she
is
old
enough
to
play
with
dolls
she
plays
mother
in
all
seriousness
and
gravity
she
is
dressed
like
a
miniature
woman
and
her
dolls
are
clad
likewise
in
garments
of
doeskin
to
her
ankles
adorned
with
long
fringes
embroidered
with
porcupine
quills
and
dyed
with
root
dyes
in
various
colors
her
little
blanket
or
robe
with
which
she
shyly
drapes
or
screens
her
head
and
shoulders
is
the
skin
of
a
buffalo
calf
or
a
deer
soft
white
embroidered
on
the
smooth
side
and
often
with
the
head
and
hoofs
left
on
you
must
never
forget
my
little
daughter
that
you
are
a
woman
like
myself
do
always
those
things
that
you
see
me
do
her
mother
often
admonishes
her
even
the
language
of
the
sioux
has
its
feminine
dialect
and
the
tiny
girl
would
be
greatly
abashed
were
it
ever
needful
to
correct
her
for
using
a
masculine
termination
this
mother
makes
for
her
little
daughter
a
miniature
copy
of
every
rude
tool
that
she
uses
in
her
daily
tasks
there
is
a
little
scraper
of
to
scrape
rawhides
preparatory
to
tanning
them
another
scraper
of
a
different
shape
for
tanning
bone
knives
and
stone
mallets
for
pounding
and
jerked
meat
while
her
mother
is
bending
over
a
large
stretched
and
pinned
upon
the
ground
standing
upon
it
and
scraping
off
the
fleshy
portion
as
nimbly
as
a
carpenter
shaves
a
board
with
his
plane
winona
at
five
years
of
age
stands
upon
a
corner
of
the
great
hide
and
industriously
scrapes
away
with
her
tiny
instrument
when
the
mother
stops
to
sharpen
her
tool
the
little
woman
always
sharpens
hers
also
perhaps
there
is
water
to
be
fetched
in
bags
made
from
the
dried
pericardium
of
an
animal
the
girl
brings
some
in
a
smaller
when
her
mother
goes
for
wood
she
carries
one
or
two
sticks
on
her
back
she
pitches
her
play
teepee
to
form
an
exact
copy
of
her
mother
s
her
little
belongings
are
nearly
all
practical
and
her
very
play
is
real
thus
before
she
is
ten
years
old
winona
begins
to
see
life
honestly
and
in
earnest
to
consider
herself
a
factor
in
the
life
of
her
people
a
link
in
the
genealogy
of
her
race
yet
her
effort
is
not
forced
her
work
not
done
from
necessity
it
is
normal
and
a
development
of
the
of
the
young
creature
this
sort
of
training
leads
very
early
to
a
genuine
desire
to
serve
and
to
do
for
others
the
little
winona
loves
to
give
and
to
please
to
be
generous
and
gracious
there
is
no
thought
of
trafficking
or
economizing
in
labor
and
in
love
mother
i
want
to
be
like
the
beavers
the
ants
and
the
spiders
because
my
grandmother
says
those
are
the
people
most
worthy
of
imitation
for
their
industry
she
also
tells
me
that
i
should
watch
the
bee
the
one
that
has
so
many
daughters
and
allows
no
young
men
to
come
around
her
daughters
while
they
are
at
work
making
sweets
exclaims
the
little
maiden
truly
their
industry
helps
us
much
for
we
often
take
from
their
hoard
remarks
the
mother
that
is
not
right
is
it
mother
if
they
do
not
wish
to
share
with
us
asks
winona
but
i
think
the
bee
is
stingy
if
she
has
so
much
and
will
not
share
with
any
one
else
when
i
grow
up
i
shall
help
the
poor
i
shall
have
a
big
teepee
and
invite
old
people
often
for
when
people
get
old
they
seem
to
be
always
hungry
and
i
think
we
ought
to
feed
my
little
daughter
will
please
me
and
her
father
if
she
proves
to
be
industrious
and
skillful
with
her
needle
and
in
all
woman
s
work
then
she
can
have
a
fine
teepee
and
make
it
all
cheerful
within
the
indolent
woman
has
a
small
teepee
and
it
is
very
smoky
all
her
children
will
have
sore
eyes
and
her
husband
will
soon
become
declares
the
mother
in
all
seriousness
and
daughter
there
is
something
more
than
this
needed
to
make
a
cheerful
home
you
must
have
a
good
heart
be
patient
and
speak
but
little
every
creature
that
talks
too
much
is
sure
to
make
trouble
she
concludes
wisely
one
day
this
careful
mother
has
completed
a
beautiful
little
teepee
of
the
skin
of
a
buffalo
calf
worked
with
red
porcupine
quills
in
a
row
of
rings
just
below
the
and
on
each
side
of
the
front
opening
in
the
center
of
each
ring
is
a
tassel
of
red
and
white
the
tip
of
each
is
decorated
with
the
same
material
and
the
doorflap
also
within
there
are
neatly
arranged
boxes
for
housekeeping
and
square
bags
of
soft
buckskin
adorned
with
blue
and
white
beads
on
either
side
of
the
fireplace
are
spread
the
tanned
skins
of
a
buffalo
calf
and
a
deer
but
there
is
no
bear
wolf
or
wildcat
skin
for
on
these
the
foot
of
a
woman
must
never
tread
they
are
for
men
and
symbolical
of
manly
virtues
there
are
dolls
of
all
sizes
and
a
play
travois
leans
against
the
white
wall
of
the
miniature
lodge
even
the
pet
pup
is
called
in
to
complete
the
fanciful
home
of
the
little
woman
now
my
daughter
says
the
mother
you
must
keep
your
lodge
in
order
here
the
little
woman
is
allowed
to
invite
other
little
women
her
playmates
this
is
where
the
grandmothers
hold
sway
chaperoning
their
young
charges
who
must
never
be
long
out
of
their
sight
the
little
visitors
bring
their
of
various
skins
artistically
made
and
trimmed
these
contain
moccasins
and
other
garments
for
their
dolls
on
which
they
love
to
occupy
themselves
the
rawhide
boxes
are
reserved
for
food
and
in
these
the
girls
bring
various
prepared
meats
and
other
delicacies
this
is
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
part
of
the
play
to
the
chaperon
who
is
treated
as
an
honored
guest
at
the
feast
winona
seldom
plays
with
boys
even
her
own
brothers
and
cousins
and
after
she
reaches
twelve
or
fourteen
years
of
age
she
scarcely
speaks
to
them
modesty
is
a
virtue
which
is
deeply
impressed
upon
her
from
early
childhood
and
the
bashfully
drooping
head
the
averted
look
the
voice
low
and
seldom
heard
these
are
graces
much
esteemed
in
a
maiden
she
is
taught
to
pay
great
attention
to
the
care
of
her
long
glossy
locks
combing
plaiting
and
perfuming
them
with
leaves
steeped
in
oil
her
personal
appearance
is
well
understood
to
be
a
matter
of
real
moment
and
rich
dress
and
ornaments
are
highly
prized
fortunately
they
never
go
out
of
fashion
and
once
owned
are
permanent
possessions
unless
parted
with
as
ceremonial
gifts
on
some
great
occasion
of
mourning
or
festivity
when
she
reaches
a
marriageable
age
her
father
allows
her
to
give
a
feast
to
all
the
other
girls
of
her
immediate
clan
and
this
feast
of
virgins
may
only
be
attended
by
those
of
spotless
reputation
to
have
given
or
attended
a
number
of
them
is
regarded
as
a
choice
honor
tatiyopa
by
the
time
she
is
fifteen
has
already
a
name
for
skill
in
needlework
and
generosity
in
distributing
the
articles
of
her
own
making
she
is
now
generally
called
winona
the
charitable
and
kind
she
believes
that
it
is
woman
s
work
to
make
and
keep
a
home
that
will
be
worthy
of
the
bravest
and
hospitable
to
all
and
in
this
simple
faith
she
enters
upon
the
realities
of
her
womanhood
ii

the
braver

the
bravest
you
sought

more
than

the

is
blue
overhead
peeping
through
openings
in
a
roof
of
green
leaves
right
between
a
great
pine
and
a
birch
tree
their
soft
doeskin
shawls
are
spread
and
there
sit
two
sioux
maidens
amid
their
fineries
variously
colored
porcupine
quills
for
embroidery
laid
upon
sheets
of
thin
and
moccasin
tops
worked
in
colors
like
autumn
leaves
it
is
winona
and
her
friend
miniyata
they
have
arrived
at
the
period
during
which
the
young
girl
is
carefully
secluded
from
her
brothers
and
cousins
and
future
lovers
and
retires
as
it
were
into
the
nunnery
of
the
woods
behind
a
veil
of
thick
foliage
thus
she
is
expected
to
develop
fully
her
womanly
qualities
in
meditation
and
solitude
entirely
alone
or
with
a
chosen
companion
of
her
own
sex
and
age
she
gains
a
secret
strength
as
she
studies
the
art
of
womanhood
from
nature
herself
winona
has
the
robust
beauty
of
the
wild
lily
of
the
prairie
pure
and
strong
in
her
deep
colors
of
yellow
and
scarlet
against
the
savage
plain
and
horizon
basking
in
the
open
sun
like
a
child
yet
soft
and
with
drooping
head
when
observed
both
girls
are
beautifully
robed
in
loose
gowns
of
soft
doeskin
girded
about
the
waist
with
the
usual
very
wide
leather
belt
come
let
us
practice
our
sacred
dance
says
one
to
the
other
each
crowns
her
glossy
head
with
a
wreath
of
wild
flowers
and
they
dance
with
slow
steps
around
the
white
birch
singing
meanwhile
the
sacred
songs
now
upon
the
lake
that
stretches
blue
to
the
eastward
there
appears
a
distant
canoe
a
mere
speck
no
bigger
than
a
bird
far
off
against
the
shining
sky
see
the
lifting
of
the
paddles
exclaims
winona
like
the
leaping
of
a
trout
upon
the
water
suggests
miniyata
i
hope
they
will
not
discover
us
yet
i
would
like
to
know
who
they
are
remarks
the
other
innocently
the
birch
canoe
approaches
swiftly
with
two
young
men
plying
the
light
cedar
paddles
the
girls
now
settle
down
to
their
needlework
quite
as
if
they
had
never
laughed
or
danced
or
woven
garlands
bending
over
their
embroidery
in
perfect
silence
surely
they
would
not
wish
to
attract
attention
for
the
two
sturdy
young
warriors
have
already
landed
they
pick
up
the
canoe
and
lay
it
well
up
on
the
bank
out
of
sight
then
one
procures
a
strong
pole
they
lift
a
buck
deer
from
the
canoe
not
a
mark
upon
it
save
for
the
bullet
wound
the
deer
looks
as
if
it
were
sleeping
they
tie
the
hind
legs
together
and
the
fore
legs
also
and
carry
it
between
them
on
the
pole
quickly
and
cleverly
they
do
all
this
and
now
they
start
forward
and
come
unexpectedly
upon
the
maidens
retreat
they
pause
for
an
instant
in
mute
apology
but
the
girls
smile
their
forgiveness
and
the
youths
hurry
on
toward
the
village
winona
has
now
attended
her
first
maidens
feast
and
is
considered
eligible
to
marriage
she
may
receive
young
men
but
not
in
public
or
in
a
social
way
for
such
was
not
the
custom
of
the
sioux
when
he
speaks
she
need
not
answer
him
unless
she
chooses
the
indian
woman
in
her
quiet
way
preserves
the
dignity
of
the
home
from
our
standpoint
the
white
man
is
a
the
great
mystery
we
say
does
not
adorn
the
woman
above
the
man
his
law
is
spreading
horns
or
flowing
mane
or
gorgeous
plumage
for
the
male
the
female
he
made
plain
but
comely
modest
and
gentle
she
is
the
foundation
of
man
s
dignity
and
honor
upon
her
rests
the
life
of
the
home
and
of
the
family
i
have
often
thought
that
there
is
much
in
this
philosophy
of
an
untutored
people
had
her
husband
remained
long
enough
in
one
place
the
indian
woman
i
believe
would
have
developed
no
mean
civilization
and
culture
of
her
own
it
was
no
disgrace
to
the
chief
s
daughter
in
the
old
days
to
work
with
her
hands
indeed
their
standard
of
worth
was
the
willingness
to
work
but
not
for
the
sake
of
accumulation
only
in
order
to
give
winona
has
learned
to
prepare
skins
to
remove
the
hair
and
tan
the
skin
of
a
deer
so
that
it
may

moccasins
within
three
days
she
has
a
bone
tool
for
each
stage
of
the
conversion
of
the
stiff
into
velvety
leather
she
has
been
taught
the
art
of
painting
tents
and
cases
and
the
manufacture
of
garments
of
all
kinds
generosity
is
a
trait
that
is
highly
developed
in
the
sioux
woman
she
makes
many
moccasins
and
other
articles
of
clothing
for
her
male
relatives
or
for
any
who
are
not
well
provided
she
loves
to
see
her
brother
the
best
dressed
among
the
young
men
and
the
moccasins
especially
of
a
young
brave
are
the
pride
of
his
her
own
person
is
neatly
attired
but
ordinarily
with
great
simplicity
her
doeskin
gown
has
wide
flowing
sleeves
the
neck
is
low
but
not
so
low
as
is
the
evening
dress
of
society
her
moccasins
are
plain
her
leggins
and
not
as
high
as
her
brother
s
she
parts
her
smooth
hair
in
the
middle
and
plaits
it
in
two
in
the
old
days
she
used
to
do
it
in
one
plait
wound
around
with
wampum
her
ornaments
sparingly
worn
are
beads
elks
teeth
and
a
touch
of
red
paint
no
feathers
are
worn
by
the
woman
unless
in
a
sacred
dance
she
is
supposed
to
be
always
occupied
with
some
feminine
pursuit
or
engaged
in
some
social
affair
which
also
is
strictly
feminine
as
a
rule
even
her
language
is
peculiar
to
her
sex
some
words
being
used
by
women
only
while
others
have
a
feminine
termination
there
is
an
etiquette
of
sitting
and
standing
which
is
strictly
observed
the
woman
must
never
raise
her
knees
or
cross
her
feet
when
seated
she
seats
herself
on
the
ground
sidewise
with
both
feet
under
her
notwithstanding
her
modesty
and
undemonstrative
ways
there
is
no
lack
of
mirth
and
relaxation
for
winona
among
her
girl
companions
in
summer
swimming
and
playing
in
the
water
is
a
favorite
amusement
she
even
imitates
with
the
soles
of
her
feet
the
peculiar
resonant
sound
that
the
beaver
makes
with
her
large
flat
tail
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
she
is
a
graceful
swimmer
keeping
the
feet
together
and
waving
them
backward
and
forward
like
the
tail
of
a
fish
nearly
all
her
games
are
different
from
those
of
the
men
she
has
a
sport
of
which
develops
fine
muscles
of
the
shoulder
and
back
the
wands
are
about
eight
feet
long
and
taper
gradually
from
an
inch
and
a
half
to
half
an
inch
in
diameter
some
of
them
are
artistically
made
with
heads
of
bone
and
horn
so
that
it
is
remarkable
to
what
a
distance
they
may
be
made
to
slide
over
the
ground
in
the
feminine
game
of
ball
which
is
something
like
shinny
the
ball
is
driven
with
curved
sticks
between
two
goals
it
is
played
with
from
two
or
three
to
a
hundred
on
a
side
and
a
game
between
two
bands
or
villages
is
a
picturesque
event
a
common
indoor
diversion
is
the
deer
s
foot
game
played
with
six
deer
hoofs
on
a
string
ending
in
a
bone
or
steel
awl
the
object
is
to
throw
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
catch
one
or
more
hoofs
on
the
point
of
the
awl
a
feat
which
requires
no
little
dexterity
another
is
played
with
marked
in
a
bowl
which
are
thrown
like
dice
and
count
according
to
the
side
that
is
turned
uppermost
winona
s
wooing
is
a
typical
one
as
with
any
other
people
is
more
or
less
in
vogue
at
all
times
of
the
year
but
more
especially
at
midsummer
during
the
characteristic
reunions
and
festivities
of
that
season
the
young
men
go
about
usually
in
pairs
and
the
maidens
do
likewise
they
may
meet
by
chance
at
any
time
of
day
in
the
woods
or
at
the
spring
but
oftenest
seek
to
do
so
after
dark
just
outside
the
teepee
the
girl
has
her
companion
and
he
has
his
for
the
sake
of
propriety
or
protection
the
conversation
is
carried
on
in
a
whisper
so
that
even
these
chaperons
do
not
hear
at
the
sound
of
the
drum
on
summer
evenings
dances
are
begun
within
the
circular
rows
of
teepees
but
without
the
circle
the
young
men
promenade
in
pairs
each
provides
himself
with
the
plaintive
flute
and
plays
the
simple
cadences
of
his
people
while
his
person
is
completely
covered
with
his
fine
robe
so
that
he
can
not
be
recognized
by
the
passerby
at
every
pause
in
the
melody
he
gives
his
to
which
the
girls
respond
with
their
musical
laughter
matosapa
has
loved
winona
since
the
time
he
saw
her
at
the
lakeside
in
her
parlor
among
the
pines
but
he
has
not
had
much
opportunity
to
speak
until
on
such
a
night
after
the
dances
are
over
there
is
no
outside
fire
but
a
dim
light
from
within
the
skin
teepees
sheds
a
mellow
glow
over
the
camp
mingling
with
the
light
of
a
young
moon
thus
these
lovers
go
about
like
ghosts
matosapa
has
already
circled
the
teepees
with
his
inseparable
brave
elk
friend
do
me
an
honor
he
exclaims
at
last
open
this
first
door
for
me
since
this
will
be
the
first
time
i
shall
speak
to
a
woman
ah
suggests
brave
elk
i
hope
you
have
selected
a
girl
whose
grandmother
has
no
cross
dogs
the
prize
that
is
won
at
great
risk
is
usually
valued
most
replies
matosapa
ho
kola
i
shall
touch
the
as
softly
as
the
swallow
alights
upon
her
nest
but
i
warn
you
do
not
let
your
heart
beat
too
loudly
for
the
old
woman
s
ears
are
still
good
so
joking
and
laughing
they
proceed
toward
a
large
buffalo
tent
with
a
horse
s
tail
suspended
from
the
highest
pole
to
indicate
the
rank
of
the
owner
they
have
ceased
to
blow
the
flute
some
paces
back
and
walk
noiselessly
as
a
panther
in
quest
of
a
doe
brave
elk
opens
the
door
matosapa
enters
the
tent
as
was
the
wont
of
the
sioux
the
maid
has
a
little
teepee
within
a
teepee
a
private
apartment
of
her
own
he
passes
the
sleeping
family
to
this
inner
shrine
there
he
gently
wakens
winona
with
proper
apologies
this
is
not
unusual
or
strange
to
her
innocence
for
it
was
the
custom
of
the
people
he
sits
at
the
door
while
his
friend
waits
outside
and
tells
his
love
in
a
whisper
to
this
she
does
not
reply
at
once
even
if
she
loves
him
it
is
proper
that
she
should
be
silent
the
lover
does
not
know
whether
he
is
favorably
received
or
not
upon
this
his
first
visit
he
must
now
seek
her
outside
upon
every
favorable
occasion
no
gifts
are
offered
at
this
stage
of
the
affair
the
trafficking
in
ponies
and
buying
a
wife
is
entirely
a
modern
custom
matosapa
has
improved
every
opportunity
until
winona
has
at
last
shyly
admitted
her
willingness
to
listen
for
a
whole
year
he
has
been
compelled
at
intervals
to
repeat
the
story
of
his
love
through
the
autumn
hunting
of
the
buffalo
and
the
long
cold
winter
he
often
presents
her
kinsfolk
with
his
game
at
the
next
midsummer
the
parents
on
both
sides
are
made
acquainted
with
the
betrothal
and
they
at
once
begin
preparations
for
the
coming
wedding
provisions
and
delicacies
of
all
kinds
are
laid
aside
for
a
feast
matosapa
s
sisters
and
his
girl
cousins
are
told
of
the
approaching
event
and
they
too
prepare
for
it
since
it
is
their
duty
to
dress
or
adorn
the
bride
with
garments
made
by
their
own
hands
with
the
sioux
of
the
old
days
the
great
natural
crises
of
human
life
marriage
and
birth
were
considered
sacred
and
hedged
about
with
great
privacy
therefore
the
union
is
publicly
celebrated
after
and
not
before
its
consummation
suddenly
the
young
couple
disappear
they
go
out
into
the
wilderness
together
and
spend
some
days
or
weeks
away
from
the
camp
this
is
their
honeymoon
away
from
all
curious
or
prying
eyes
in
due
time
they
quietly
return
he
to
his
home
and
she
to
hers
and
now
at
last
the
marriage
is
announced
and
invitations
are
given
to
the
feast
the
bride
is
ceremoniously
delivered
to
her
husband
s
people
together
with
presents
of
rich
clothing
collected
from
all
her
clan
which
she
afterward
distributes
among
her
new
relations
winona
is
carried
in
a
travois
handsomely
decorated
and
is
received
with
equal
ceremony
for
several
days
following
she
is
dressed
and
painted
by
the
female
relatives
of
the
groom
each
in
her
turn
while
in
both
clans
the
wedding
feast
is
celebrated
to
illustrate
womanly
nobility
of
nature
let
me
tell
the
story
of
dowanhotaninwin
the
maiden
was
deprived
of
both
father
and
mother
when
scarcely
ten
years
old
by
an
attack
of
the
sacs
and
foxes
while
they
were
on
a
hunting
expedition
left
alone
with
her
grandmother
she
was
carefully
reared
and
trained
by
this
sage
of
the
wild
life
nature
had
given
her
more
than
her
share
of
attractiveness
and
she
was
womanly
and
winning
as
she
was
handsome
yet
she
remained
unmarried
for
nearly
thirty
years
a
most
unusual
thing
among
us
and
although
she
had
worthy
suitors
in
every
branch
of
the
sioux
nation
she
quietly
refused
every
offer
certain
warriors
who
had
distinguished
themselves
against
the
particular
tribe
who
had
made
her
an
orphan
persistently
sought
her
hand
in
marriage
but
failed
utterly
one
summer
the
sioux
and
the
sacs
and
foxes
were
brought
together
under
a
flag
of
truce
by
the
commissioners
of
the
great
white
father
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
treaty
with
them
during
the
short
period
of
friendly
intercourse
and
social
dance
and
feast
a
noble
warrior
of
the
enemy
s
tribe
courted
dowanhotaninwin
several
of
her
old
lovers
were
vying
with
one
another
to
win
her
at
the
same
time
that
she
might
have
celebration
of
her
wedding
behold
the
maiden
accepted
the
foe
of
her
childhood
one
of
those
who
had
cruelly
deprived
her
of
her
parents
by
night
she
fled
to
the
sac
and
fox
camp
with
her
lover
it
seemed
at
first
an
insult
to
the
sioux
and
there
was
almost
an
outbreak
among
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
who
were
barely
restrained
by
their
respect
for
the
commissioners
of
the
great
father
but
her
aged
grandfather
explained
the
matter
publicly
in
this
fashion
young
men
hear
ye
your
hearts
are
strong
let
them
not
be
troubled
by
the
act
of
a
young
woman
of
your
tribe
this
has
been
her
secret
wish
since
she
became
a
woman
she
deprecates
all
tribal
warfare
her
young
heart
never
forgot
its
early
sorrow
yet
she
has
never
blamed
the
sacs
and
foxes
or
held
them
responsible
for
the
deed
she
blames
rather
the
customs
of
war
among
us
she
believes
in
the
formation
of
a
blood
brotherhood
strong
enough
to
prevent
all
this
cruel
and
useless
enmity
this
was
her
high
purpose
and
to
this
end
she
reserved
her
hand
forgive
her
forgive
her
i
pray
in
the
morning
there
was
a
great
commotion
the
herald
of
the
sacs
and
foxes
entered
the
sioux
camp
attired
in
ceremonial
garb
and
bearing
in
one
hand
an
american
flag
and
in
the
other
a
he
made
the
rounds
singing
a
peace
song
and
delivering
to
all
an
invitation
to
attend
the
wedding
feast
of
dowanhotaninwin
and
their
chief
s
son
thus
all
was
well
the
simplicity
high
purpose
and
bravery
of
the
girl
won
the
hearts
of
the
two
tribes
and
as
long
as
she
lived
she
was
able
to
keep
the
peace
between
them
iii
snana
s
fawn
the
little
missouri
was
in
her
spring
fullness
and
the
hills
among
which
she
found
her
way
to
the
great
muddy
were
profusely
adorned
with
colors
much
like
those
worn
by
the
wild
red
man
upon
a
holiday
looking
toward
the
sunrise
one
saw
mysterious
deep
shadows
and
bright
prominences
while
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
really
an
extravagant
array
of
variegated
hues
between
the
gorgeous
buttes
and
ridges
there
were
narrow
plains
broken
here
and
there
by
dry
creeks
or
gulches
and
these
again
were
clothed
scantily
with
poplars
and
bushes
while
the
bare
spots
were
purple
with
the
wild
dakota
crocuses
upon
the
lowest
of
a
series
of
natural
terraces
there
stood
on
this
may
morning
a
young
sioux
girl
whose
graceful
movements
were
not
unlike
those
of
a
doe
which
chanced
to
be
lurking
in
a
neighboring
gulch
on
the
upper
plains
not
far
away
were
her
young
companions
all
busily
employed
with
the
wewoptay
as
it
was
called
the
stick
with
which
the
sioux
women
dig
wild
turnips
they
were
gayly
gossiping
together
or
each
humming
a
as
she
worked
only
snana
stood
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
in
fact
concealed
by
the
crest
of
the
ridge
she
had
paused
in
her
digging
and
stood
facing
the
buttes
above
them
in
the
clear
blue
sky
the
father
sun
was
traveling
upward
as
in
haste
while
to
her
receptive
spirit
there
appealed
an
awful
unknown
force
the
silent
speech
of
the
great
mystery
to
which
it
seemed
to
her
the
whole
world
must
be
listening
o
great
mystery
the
father
of
earthly
things
is
coming
to
quicken
us
into
life
have
pity
on
me
i
pray
thee
may
i
some
day
become
the
mother
of
a
great
and
brave
race
of
warriors
so
the
maiden
prayed
silently
it
was
now
day
the
sun
shone
hot
upon
the
bare
ground
and
the
drops
stood
upon
snana
s
forehead
as
she
plied
her
long
pole
there
was
a
cool
spring
in
the
dry
creek
bed
near
by
well
hidden
by
a
clump
of
chokecherry
bushes
and
she
turned
thither
to
cool
her
thirsty
throat
in
the
depths
of
the
ravine
her
eye
caught
a
familiar
footprint
the
track
of
a
doe
with
the
young
fawn
beside
it
the
hunting
instinct
arose
within
it
will
be
a
great
feat
if
i
can
find
and
take
from
her
the
babe
the
little
tawny
skin
shall
be
beautifully
dressed
by
my
mother
the
legs
and
the
nose
shall
be
embossed
with
porcupine
quills
it
will
be
my
she
said
to
herself
as
she
stole
forward
on
the
fresh
trail
she
scanned
every
nook
every
clump
of
bushes
there
was
a
sudden
rustle
from
within
a
grove
of
wild
plum
trees
thickly
festooned
with
grape
and
clematis
and
the
doe
mother
bounded
away
as
carelessly
as
if
she
were
never
to
return
ah
a
mother
s
ruse
snana
entered
the
thorny
enclosure
which
was
almost
a
rude
teepee
and
tucked
away
in
the
furthermost
corner
lay
something
with
a
speckled
tawny
coat
she
bent
over
it
the
fawn
was
apparently
sleeping
presently
its
eyes
moved
a
bit
and
a
shiver
passed
through
its
subtle
body
thou
shalt
not
die
thy
skin
shall
not
become
my
unconsciously
the
maiden
spoke
the
mother
sympathy
had
taken
hold
on
her
mind
she
picked
the
fawn
up
tenderly
bound
its
legs
and
put
it
on
her
back
to
carry
like
an
indian
babe
in
the
folds
of
her
robe
i
can
not
leave
you
alone
tachinchala
your
mother
is
not
here
our
hunters
will
soon
return
by
this
road
and
your
mother
has
left
behind
her
two
plain
tracks
leading
to
this
thicket
she
murmured
the
wild
creature
struggled
vigorously
for
a
minute
and
then
became
quiet
its
graceful
head
protruded
from
the
elkskin
robe
just
over
snana
s
shoulder
she
was
slowly
climbing
the
slope
with
her
burden
when
suddenly
like
an
apparition
the
stood
before
her
the
fawn
called
loudly
when
it
was
first
seized
and
the
mother
was
not
too
far
away
to
hear
now
she
called
frantically
for
her
child
at
the
same
time
stamping
with
her
delicate
yes
sister
you
are
right
she
is
yours
but
you
can
not
save
her
the
hunters
will
soon
be
here
let
me
keep
her
for
you
i
will
return
her
to
you
safely
and
hear
me
o
sister
of
the
woods
that
some
day
i
may
become
the
mother
of
a
noble
race
of
warriors
and
of
fine
women
as
handsome
as
you
are
at
this
moment
the
quick
eyes
of
the
indian
girl
detected
something
strange
in
the
doe
s
actions
she
glanced
in
every
direction
and
behold
a
grizzly
bear
was
cautiously
approaching
the
group
from
a
considerable
distance
run
run
sister
i
shall
save
your
child
if
i
can
she
cried
and
flew
for
the
nearest
scrub
oak
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
up
the
tree
she
scrambled
with
the
fawn
still
securely
bound
to
her
back
the
grizzly
came
on
with
teeth
exposed
and
the
in
her
flight
came
between
him
and
the
tree
giving
a
series
of
indignant
snorts
as
she
ran
and
so
distracted
mato
from
his
object
of
attack
but
only
for
a
few
seconds
then
on
he
came
desist
o
brave
mato
it
does
not
become
a
great
to
attack
a
helpless
woman
with
a
burden
upon
her
back
snana
spoke
as
if
the
huge
brute
could
understand
her
and
indeed
the
indians
hold
that
wild
animals
understand
intuitively
when
appealed
to
by
human
beings
in
distress
yet
he
replied
only
with
a
hoarse
growl
as
rising
upon
his
hind
legs
he
shook
the
little
tree
vigorously
ye
ye
heyupi
ye
snana
called
loudly
to
her
companion
her
cry
soon
brought
all
the
women
into
sight
upon
a
ridge
and
they
immediately
gave
a
general
alarm
mato
saw
them
but
appeared
not
at
all
concerned
and
was
still
intent
upon
dislodging
the
girl
who
clung
frantically
to
her
perch
presently
there
appeared
upon
the
little
knoll
several
warriors
mounted
and
uttering
the
usual
as
if
they
were
about
to
swoop
down
upon
a
human
enemy
this
touched
the
dignity
of
mato
and
he
immediately
prepared
to
accept
the
challenge
every
indian
was
alive
to
the
possibilities
of
the
occasion
for
it
is
well
known
that
mato
or
grizzly
bear
alone
among
animals
is
given
the
rank
of
a
warrior
so
that
whoever
conquers
him
may
wear
an
eagle
feather
woo
woo
the
warriors
shouted
as
they
maneuvered
to
draw
him
into
the
open
plain
he
answered
with
hoarse
growls
threatening
a
rider
who
had
ventured
too
near
but
arrows
were
many
and
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
great
and
warlike
mato
lay
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
the
men
ran
forward
and
counted
their
coups
on
him
just
as
when
an
enemy
is
fallen
then
they
looked
at
one
another
and
placed
their
hands
over
their
mouths
as
the
young
girl
descended
the
tree
with
a
fawn
bound
upon
her
back
so
that
was
the
bait
they
cried
and
will
you
not
make
a
feast
with
that
fawn
for
us
who
came
to
your
rescue
the
fawn
is
young
and
tender
and
we
have
not
eaten
meat
for
two
days
it
will
be
a
generous
thing
to
do
added
her
father
who
was
among
them
she
cried
out
in
distress
do
not
ask
it
i
have
seen
this
fawn
s
mother
i
have
promised
to
keep
her
child
safe
see
i
have
saved
its
life
even
when
my
own
was
in
ho
ho
wakan
ye
lo
yes
yes
tis
holy
or
mysterious
they
exclaimed
approvingly
it
was
no
small
trouble
for
snana
to
keep
her
trust
as
may
well
be
supposed
all
the
dogs
of
the
teepee
village
must
be
watched
and
kept
at
a
distance
neither
was
it
easy
to
feed
the
little
captive
but
in
gaining
its
confidence
the
girl
was
an
adept
the
fawn
soon
followed
her
everywhere
and
called
to
her
when
hungry
exactly
as
she
had
called
to
her
own
mother
after
several
days
when
her
fright
at
the
encounter
with
the
bear
had
somewhat
worn
off
snana
took
her
pet
into
the
woods
and
back
to
the
very
spot
in
which
she
had
found
it
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
wild
plum
grove
she
laid
it
down
gently
stroked
its
soft
forehead
and
smoothed
the
leaflike
ears
the
little
thing
closed
its
eyes
once
more
the
sioux
girl
bent
over
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
fawn
s
head
then
reluctantly
she
moved
away
hoping
and
yet
dreading
that
the
mother
would
return
she
crouched
under
a
clump
of
bushes
near
by
and
gave
the
doe
call
it
was
a
reckless
thing
for
her
to
do
for
such
a
call
might
bring
upon
her
a
mountain
lion
or
silvertip
but
snana
did
not
think
of
that
in
a
few
minutes
she
heard
the
light
patter
of
hoofs
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
doe
running
straight
toward
the
fawn
s
when
she
stole
near
enough
to
see
the
doe
and
the
fawn
were
examining
one
another
carefully
as
if
fearing
some
treachery
at
last
both
were
apparently
satisfied
the
doe
caressed
her
natural
child
and
the
little
one
accepted
the
milk
she
offered
in
the
sioux
maiden
s
mind
there
was
turmoil
a
close
attachment
to
the
little
wild
creature
had
already
taken
root
there
contending
with
the
sense
of
justice
that
was
strong
within
her
now
womanly
sympathy
for
the
mother
was
in
control
and
now
a
desire
to
possess
and
protect
her
helpless
pet
i
can
take
care
of
her
against
all
hunters
both
animal
and
human
they
are
ever
ready
to
seize
the
helpless
fawn
for
food
her
life
will
be
often
exposed
you
can
not
save
her
from
disaster
o
takcha
my
sister
let
me
still
keep
her
for
you
she
finally
appealed
to
the
poor
doe
who
was
nervously
watching
the
intruder
and
apparently
thinking
how
she
might
best
escape
with
the
fawn
just
at
this
moment
there
came
a
low
call
from
the
wood
it
was
a
doe
call
but
the
wild
mother
and
her
new
friend
both
knew
that
it
was
not
the
call
of
a
real
doe
it
is
a
sioux
hunter
whispered
the
girl
you
must
go
my
sister
be
off
i
will
take
your
child
to
safety
while
she
was
yet
speaking
the
doe
seemed
to
realize
the
danger
she
stopped
only
an
instant
to
lick
fondly
the
tawny
coat
of
the
little
one
who
had
just
finished
her
dinner
then
she
bounded
away
as
snana
emerged
from
the
bushes
with
her
charge
a
young
hunter
met
her
face
to
face
and
stared
at
her
curiously
he
was
not
of
her
father
s
camp
but
a
stranger
ugh
you
have
my
tosh
she
replied
coquettishly
it
was
so
often
said
among
the
indians
that
the
doe
was
wont
to
put
on
human
form
to
mislead
the
hunter
that
it
looked
strange
to
see
a
woman
with
a
fawn
and
the
young
man
could
not
forbear
to
gaze
upon
snana
you
are
not
the
real
mother
in
maiden
s
guise
tell
me
truly
if
you
are
of
human
blood
he
demanded
rudely
i
am
a
sioux
maiden
do
you
not
know
my
father
she
replied
ah
but
who
is
your
father
what
is
his
name
he
insisted
nervously
fingering
his
arrows
do
not
be
a
coward
surely
you
should
know
a
maid
of
your
own
race
she
replied
reproachfully
ah
you
know
the
tricks
of
the
doe
what
is
thy
name
hast
thou
forgotten
the
etiquette
of
thy
people
and
wouldst
compel
me
to
pronounce
my
own
name
i
refuse
thou
art
jesting
she
retorted
with
a
smile
thou
dost
give
the
tricky
answers
of
a
doe
i
can
not
wait
i
must
act
before
i
lose
my
natural
mind
but
already
i
am
yours
whatever
purpose
you
may
have
in
thus
charming
a
poor
hunter
be
merciful
and
throwing
aside
his
quiver
he
sat
down
the
maiden
stole
a
glance
at
his
face
and
then
another
he
was
handsome
softly
she
reentered
the
thicket
and
laid
down
the
little
fawn
promise
me
never
to
hunt
here
again
she
said
earnestly
as
she
came
forth
without
her
pretty
burden
and
he
exacted
another
promise
in
return
thus
snana
lost
her
fawn
and
found
a
lover
iv
it
was
a
long
time
ago
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
that
some
of
our
people
were
living
upon
the
shores
of
the
great
lake
lake
superior
the
chief
of
this
band
was
called
tatankaota
many
buffaloes
one
day
the
young
son
of
tatankaota
led
a
against
the
ojibways
who
occupied
the
country
east
of
us
toward
the
rising
sun
when
they
had
gone
a
day
s
journey
in
the
direction
of
sault
ste
marie
in
our
language
skesketatanka
the
warriors
took
up
their
position
on
the
lake
shore
at
a
point
which
the
ojibways
were
accustomed
to
pass
in
their
canoes
long
they
gazed
and
scanned
the
surface
of
the
water
watching
for
the
coming
of
the
foe
the
sun
had
risen
above
the
dark
pines
over
the
great
ridge
of
woodland
across
the
bay
it
was
the
awakening
of
all
living
things
the
birds
were
singing
and
shining
fishes
leaped
out
of
the
water
as
if
at
play
at
last
far
off
there
came
the
warning
cry
of
the
loon
to
stir
their
expectant
ears
warriors
look
close
to
the
horizon
this
brother
of
ours
does
not
lie
the
enemy
comes
exclaimed
their
leader
presently
upon
the
sparkling
face
of
the
water
there
appeared
a
moving
canoe
there
was
but
one
and
it
was
coming
directly
toward
them
hahatonwan
hahatonwan
the
ojibways
the
ojibways
they
exclaimed
with
one
voice
and
grasping
their
weapons
they
hastily
concealed
themselves
in
the
bushes
spare
none
take
no
captives
ordered
the
chief
s
son
nearer
and
nearer
approached
the
strange
canoe
the
glistening
blades
of
its
paddles
flashed
as
it
were
the
signal
of
good
news
or
a
welcome
challenge
all
impatiently
waited
until
it
should
come
within
surely
it
is
an
ojibway
canoe
one
murmured
yet
look
the
stroke
is
ungainly
now
among
all
the
tribes
only
the
ojibway
s
art
is
perfect
in
paddling
a
birch
canoe
this
was
a
powerful
stroke
but
harsh
and
unsteady
see
there
are
no
feathers
on
this
man
s
head
exclaimed
the
son
of
the
chief
hold
warriors
he
wears
a
woman
s
dress
and
i
see
no
weapon
no
courage
is
needed
to
take
his
life
therefore
let
it
be
spared
i
command
that
only
coups
or
blows
be
counted
on
him
and
he
shall
tell
us
whence
he
comes
and
on
what
the
signal
was
given
the
warriors
sprang
to
their
feet
and
like
wolves
they
sped
from
the
forest
out
upon
the
white
sandy
beach
and
straight
into
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
lake
giving
the
shrill
the
warning
of
death
the
solitary
oarsman
made
no
outcry
he
offered
no
defense
kneeling
calmly
in
the
prow
of
the
little
vessel
he
merely
ceased
paddling
and
seemed
to
await
with
patience
the
deadly
blow
of
the
tomahawk
the
son
of
tatankaota
was
foremost
in
the
charge
but
suddenly
an
impulse
seized
him
to
stop
his
warriors
lest
one
in
the
heat
of
excitement
should
do
a
mischief
to
the
stranger
the
canoe
with
its
occupant
was
now
very
near
and
it
could
be
seen
that
the
expression
of
his
face
was
very
gentle
and
even
benignant
none
could
doubt
his
utter
harmlessness
and
the
chief
s
son
afterward
declared
that
at
this
moment
he
felt
a
premonition
of
some
event
but
whether
good
or
evil
he
could
not
tell
no
blows
were
struck
no
coups
counted
the
young
man
bade
his
warriors
take
up
the
canoe
and
carry
it
to
the
shore
and
although
they
murmured
somewhat
among
themselves
they
did
as
he
commanded
them
they
seized
the
light
bark
and
bore
it
dripping
to
a
hill
covered
with
tall
pines
and
overlooking
the
waters
of
the
great
lake
then
the
warriors
lifted
their
over
their
heads
and
sang
standing
around
the
canoe
in
which
the
stranger
was
still
kneeling
looking
at
him
closely
they
perceived
that
he
was
of
a
peculiar
complexion
pale
and
inclined
to
red
he
wore
a
necklace
of
beads
from
which
hung
a
cross
bearing
the
form
of
a
man
his
garments
were
strange
and
most
like
the
robes
of
woman
all
of
these
things
perplexed
them
greatly
presently
the
black
robe
told
them
by
signs
in
response
to
their
inquiries
that
he
came
from
the
rising
sun
even
beyond
the
great
salt
water
and
he
seemed
to
say
that
he
formerly
came
from
the
sky
upon
this
the
warriors
believed
that
he
must
be
a
prophet
or
mysterious
man
their
leader
directed
them
to
take
up
again
the
canoe
with
the
man
in
it
and
appointed
the
warriors
to
carry
it
by
turns
until
they
should
reach
his
father
s
village
this
was
done
according
to
the
ancient
custom
as
a
mark
of
respect
and
honor
they
took
it
up
forthwith
and
traveled
with
all
convenient
speed
along
the
lake
shore
through
forests
and
across
streams
to
a
place
called
the
maiden
s
retreat
a
short
distance
from
the
village
thence
the
chief
s
son
sent
a
messenger
to
announce
to
his
father
that
he
was
bringing
home
a
stranger
and
to
ask
whether
or
not
he
should
be
allowed
to
enter
the
village
his
appearance
declared
the
scout
is
unlike
that
of
any
man
we
have
ever
seen
and
his
ways
are
mysterious
when
the
chief
heard
these
words
he
immediately
called
his
together
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
for
he
feared
by
admitting
the
mysterious
stranger
to
bring
some
disaster
upon
his
people
finally
he
went
out
with
his
wisest
men
to
meet
his
son
s
they
looked
with
astonishment
upon
the
black
robe
dispatch
him
dispatch
him
show
him
no
mercy
cried
some
of
the
let
him
go
on
his
way
unharmed
trouble
him
not
advised
others
it
is
well
known
that
the
evil
spirits
sometimes
take
the
form
of
a
man
or
animal
from
his
strange
appearance
i
judge
this
to
be
such
a
one
he
should
be
put
to
death
lest
some
harm
befall
our
people
an
old
man
urged
by
this
time
several
of
the
women
of
the
village
had
reached
the
spot
among
them
was
the
chief
s
youngest
daughter
who
tradition
says
was
a
maiden
of
much
beauty
and
of
a
generous
heart
the
stranger
was
evidently
footsore
from
much
travel
and
weakened
by
fasting
when
she
saw
that
the
poor
man
clasped
his
hands
and
looked
skyward
as
he
uttered
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
she
pleaded
with
her
father
that
a
stranger
who
has
entered
their
midst
unchallenged
may
claim
the
hospitality
of
the
people
according
to
the
ancient
custom
father
he
is
weary
and
in
want
of
food
hold
him
no
longer
delay
your
council
until
he
is
refreshed
these
were
the
words
of
and
her
father
could
not
refuse
her
prayer
the
black
robe
was
released
and
the
sioux
maiden
led
him
to
her
father
s
teepee
now
the
warriors
had
been
surprised
and
indeed
displeased
to
find
him
dressed
after
the
fashion
of
a
woman
and
they
looked
upon
him
with
suspicion
but
from
the
moment
that
she
first
beheld
him
the
heart
of
the
maiden
had
turned
toward
this
strange
and
seemingly
unfortunate
man
it
appeared
to
her
that
great
reverence
and
meekness
were
in
his
face
and
with
it
all
she
was
struck
by
his
utter
fearlessness
his
apparent
unconsciousness
of
danger
the
chief
s
daughter
having
gained
her
father
s
permission
invited
the
black
robe
to
his
great
tent
and
spreading
a
fine
robe
she
gently
asked
him
to
be
seated
with
the
aid
of
her
mother
she
prepared
wild
rice
sweetened
with
maple
sugar
and
some
broiled
venison
for
his
repast
the
youthful
warriors
were
astonished
to
observe
these
attentions
but
the
maiden
heeded
them
not
she
anointed
the
blistered
feet
of
the
holy
man
with
perfumed
otter
oil
and
put
upon
him
a
pair
of
moccasins
beautifully
worked
by
her
own
hands
it
was
only
an
act
of
charity
on
her
part
but
the
young
men
were
displeased
and
again
urged
that
the
stranger
should
at
once
be
turned
away
some
even
suggested
harsher
measures
but
they
were
overruled
by
the
chief
softened
by
the
persuasions
of
a
daughter
during
the
few
days
that
the
black
robe
remained
in
the
sioux
village
he
preached
earnestly
to
the
maiden
for
she
had
been
permitted
to
converse
with
him
by
signs
that
she
might
try
to
ascertain
what
manner
of
man
he
was
he
told
her
of
the
coming
of
a
great
prophet
from
the
sky
and
of
his
words
that
he
had
left
with
the
people
the
cross
with
the
figure
of
a
man
he
explained
as
his
totem
which
he
had
told
them
to
carry
he
also
said
that
those
who
love
him
are
commanded
to
go
among
strange
peoples
to
tell
the
news
and
that
all
who
believe
must
be
marked
with
holy
water
and
accept
the
totem
he
asked
by
signs
if
believed
the
story
to
this
she
replied
it
is
a
sweet
story
a
likely
legend
i
do
believe
then
the
good
father
took
out
a
small
cross
and
having
pressed
it
to
his
heart
and
crossed
his
forehead
and
breast
he
gave
it
to
her
finally
he
dipped
his
finger
in
water
and
touched
the
forehead
of
the
maiden
repeating
meanwhile
some
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
the
mother
was
troubled
for
she
feared
that
the
stranger
was
trying
to
bewitch
her
daughter
but
the
chief
decided
thus
this
is
a
and
he
is
not
of
our
people
his
customs
are
different
but
they
are
not
evil
warriors
take
him
back
to
the
spot
where
you
saw
him
first
it
is
my
desire
and
the
good
custom
of
our
tribe
requires
that
you
free
him
without
injury
accordingly
they
formed
a
large
party
and
carried
the
black
robe
in
his
canoe
back
to
the
shore
of
the
great
lake
to
the
place
where
they
had
met
him
and
he
was
allowed
to
depart
thence
whithersoever
he
would
he
took
his
leave
with
signs
of
gratitude
for
their
hospitality
and
especially
for
the
kindness
of
the
beautiful
sioux
maiden
she
seemed
to
have
understood
his
mission
better
than
any
one
else
and
as
long
as
she
lived
she
kept
his
queer
trinket
as
it
seemed
to
the
others
and
performed
the
strange
acts
that
he
had
taught
her
furthermore
it
was
through
the
pleadings
of
that
the
chief
tatankaota
advised
his
people
in
after
days
to
befriend
the
white
strangers
and
though
many
of
the
other
chiefs
opposed
him
in
this
his
counsels
prevailed
hence
it
was
that
both
the
french
and
english
received
much
kindness
from
our
people
mainly
through
the
influence
of
this
one
woman
such
was
the
first
coming
of
the
white
man
among
us
as
it
is
told
in
our
traditions
other
came
later
and
many
of
the
sioux
allowed
themselves
to
be
baptized
true
there
have
been
indian
wars
but
not
without
reason
and
it
is
pleasant
to
remember
that
the
sioux
were
hospitable
to
the
first
white
prayingman
and
that
it
was
a
maiden
of
my
people
who
first
took
in
her
hands
the
cross
of
the
new
religion
the
one
of
the
most
remarkable
women
of
her
day
and
nation
was
eyatonkawee
it
is
matter
of
history
among
the
wakpaykootay
band
of
sioux
the
dwellers
among
the
leaves
that
when
eyatonkawee
was
a
very
young
woman
she
was
once
victorious
in
a
combat
with
the
enemy
in
the
woods
of
minnesota
where
her
people
were
hunting
the
deer
at
such
times
they
often
met
with
stray
parties
of
sacs
and
foxes
from
the
prairies
of
iowa
and
illinois
now
the
custom
was
among
our
people
that
the
doer
of
a
notable
warlike
deed
was
held
in
highest
honor
and
these
deeds
were
kept
constantly
in
memory
by
being
recited
in
public
before
many
witnesses
the
greatest
exploit
was
that
one
involving
most
personal
courage
and
physical
address
and
he
whose
record
was
adjudged
best
might
claim
certain
privileges
not
the
least
of
which
was
the
right
to
interfere
in
any
quarrel
and
separate
the
combatants
the
might
resort
to
force
if
need
be
and
no
one
dared
to
utter
a
protest
who
could
not
say
that
he
had
himself
achieved
an
equal
fame
there
was
a
man
called
tamahay
known
to
minnesota
history
as
the
sioux
who
was
a
notable
character
on
the
frontier
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
was
very
reckless
and
could
boast
of
many
a
perilous
adventure
he
was
the
only
sioux
who
in
the
war
of
fought
for
the
americans
while
all
the
rest
of
his
people
sided
with
the
british
mainly
through
the
influence
of
the
english
traders
among
them
at
that
time
this
same
sioux
became
a
warm
friend
of
lieutenant
pike
who
discovered
the
sources
of
the
mississippi
and
for
whom
pike
s
peak
is
named
some
say
that
the
indian
took
his
friend
s
name
for
tamahay
in
english
means
pike
or
pickerel
unfortunately
in
later
life
this
brave
man
became
a
drunkard
and
after
the
americans
took
possession
of
his
country
almost
any
one
of
them
would
supply
him
with
liquor
in
recognition
of
his
notable
services
as
a
scout
and
soldier
thus
he
was
at
times
no
less
dangerous
in
camp
than
in
battle
now
eyatonkawee
being
a
young
widow
had
married
the
son
of
a
lesser
chief
in
tamahay
s
band
and
was
living
among
strangers
moreover
she
was
yet
young
and
modest
one
day
this
bashful
matron
heard
loud
warwhoops
and
the
screams
of
women
looking
forth
she
saw
the
people
fleeing
hither
and
thither
while
tamahay
half
intoxicated
rushed
from
his
teepee
painted
for
war
armed
with
tomahawk
and
and
approached
another
warrior
as
if
to
slay
him
at
this
sight
her
heart
became
strong
and
she
quickly
sprang
between
them
with
her
woman
s
knife
in
her
hand
it
was
a
sac
warrior
of
like
proportions
and
bravery
with
your
own
who
having
slain
several
of
the
sioux
thus
approached
me
with
uplifted
tomahawk
she
exclaimed
in
a
clear
voice
and
went
on
to
recite
her
victory
on
that
famous
day
so
that
the
terrified
people
paused
to
hear
tamahay
was
greatly
astonished
but
he
was
not
too
drunk
to
realize
that
he
must
give
way
at
once
or
be
subject
to
the
humiliation
of
a
blow
from
the
who
challenged
him
thus
the
whole
camp
was
listening
and
being
unable
in
spite
of
his
giant
frame
and
record
to
cite
a
greater
deed
than
hers
he
retreated
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
thus
eyatonkawee
recounted
her
brave
deed
for
the
first
time
in
order
to
save
a
man
s
life
from
that
day
her
name
was
great
as
a
greater
even
than
when
she
had
first
defended
so
gallantly
her
babe
and
home
many
years
afterward
when
she
had
attained
middle
age
this
woman
averted
a
serious
danger
from
her
people
chief
little
crow
the
elder
was
dead
and
as
he
had
two
wives
of
two
different
bands
the
succession
was
disputed
among
the
and
their
adherents
finally
the
two
sons
of
the
wife
belonging
to
the
wabashaw
band
plotted
against
the
son
of
the
woman
of
the
kaposia
band
by
name
afterward
called
little
crow
the
man
who
led
the
minnesota
massacre
they
obtained
a
quantity
of
whisky
and
made
a
great
feast
to
which
many
were
invited
intending
when
all
were
more
or
less
intoxicated
to
precipitate
a
fight
in
which
he
should
be
killed
it
would
be
easy
afterward
to
excuse
themselves
by
saying
that
it
was
an
accident
mendota
near
what
is
now
the
thriving
city
of
saint
paul
then
a
queen
of
in
the
northwest
was
the
rendezvous
of
the
sioux
the
event
brought
many
together
for
all
warriors
of
note
were
bidden
from
far
and
near
and
even
the
great
traders
of
the
day
were
present
for
the
succession
to
the
chieftainship
was
one
which
vitally
affected
their
interests
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
all
went
well
with
speeches
and
eulogies
of
the
dead
chief
flowing
and
eloquent
such
as
only
a
native
orator
can
utter
presently
two
goodly
kegs
of
whisky
were
rolled
into
the
council
teepee
eyatonkawee
was
among
the
women
and
heard
their
expressions
of
anxiety
as
the
voices
of
the
men
rose
louder
and
more
threatening
some
carried
their
children
away
into
the
woods
for
safety
while
others
sought
speech
with
their
husbands
outside
the
council
lodge
and
besought
them
to
come
away
in
time
but
more
than
this
was
needed
to
cope
with
the
emergency
suddenly
a
familiar
form
appeared
in
the
door
of
the
council
lodge
is
it
becoming
in
a
warrior
to
spill
the
blood
of
his
tribesmen
are
there
no
longer
any
ojibways
it
was
the
voice
of
eyatonkawee
that
stronghearted
woman
advancing
at
the
critical
moment
to
the
middle
of
the
ring
of
warriors
she
once
more
recited
her
brave
deed
with
all
the
accompaniment
of
action
and
gesture
and
to
such
effect
that
the
disorderly
feast
broke
up
in
confusion
and
there
was
peace
between
the
rival
bands
of
sioux
there
was
seldom
a
dangerous
quarrel
among
the
indians
in
those
days
that
was
not
precipitated
by
the
use
of
strong
liquor
and
this
simple
indian
woman
whose
good
judgment
was
equal
to
her
courage
fully
recognized
this
fact
all
her
life
and
especially
after
her
favorite
brother
had
been
killed
in
a
drunken
brawl
in
the
early
days
of
the
american
fur
company
she
was
a
determined
enemy
to
strong
drink
and
it
is
said
did
more
to
prevent
its
use
among
her
immediate
band
than
any
other
person
being
a
woman
her
sole
means
of
recognition
was
the
brave
deed
which
she
so
wonderfully
described
and
enacted
before
the
people
during
the
lifetime
of
and
she
died
only
a
few
years
ago
it
behooved
the
sioux
men
if
they
drank
at
all
to
drink
secretly
and
in
moderation
there
are
many
who
remember
her
brave
entrance
upon
the
scene
of
carousal
and
her
dramatic
recital
of
the
immortal
deed
of
her
youth
hanta
hanta
wo
out
of
the
way
exclaim
the
dismayed
warriors
scrambling
in
every
direction
to
avoid
the
upraised
arm
of
the
terrible
old
woman
who
bursts
suddenly
upon
them
with
disheveled
hair
her
gown
torn
and
streaked
here
and
there
with
what
looks
like
fresh
blood
her
leather
leggins
loose
and
ungartered
as
if
newly
come
from
the
famous
struggle
one
of
the
men
has
a
keg
of
whisky
for
which
he
has
given
a
pony
and
the
others
have
been
invited
in
for
a
night
of
pleasure
but
scarcely
has
the
first
round
been
drunk
to
the
toast
of
great
deeds
when
eyatonkawee
is
upon
them
her
great
knife
held
high
in
her
wrinkled
left
hand
her
tomahawk
in
the
right
her
black
eyes
gleam
as
she
declaims
in
a
voice
strong
unterrified
look
look
brothers
and
husbands
the
sacs
and
foxes
are
upon
us
behold
our
braves
are
surprised
they
are
unprepared
hear
the
mothers
the
wives
and
the
children
screaming
in
affright
your
brave
sister
eyatonkawee
she
the
newly
made
mother
is
serving
the
smoking
venison
to
her
husband
just
returned
from
the
chase
ah
he
plunges
into
the
thickest
of
the
enemy
he
falls
he
falls
in
full
view
of
his
young
wife
she
desperately
presses
her
babe
to
her
breast
while
on
they
come
yelling
and
triumphant
the
foremost
of
them
all
enters
her
white
teepee
tossing
her
babe
at
the
warrior
s
feet
she
stands
before
him
defiant
but
he
straightway
levels
his
spear
at
her
bosom
quickly
she
springs
aside
and
as
quickly
deals
a
deadly
blow
with
her
ax
falls
at
her
feet
the
mighty
warrior
closely
following
on
comes
another
unknowing
what
fate
has
met
his
fellow
he
too
enters
her
teepee
and
upon
his
head
her
ax
falls
only
his
replies
another
of
heroic
size
and
great
prowess
as
witnessed
by
his
of
rushes
on
yelling
and
whooping
for
they
believe
that
victory
is
with
them
the
third
great
warrior
who
has
dared
to
enter
eyatonkawee
s
teepee
uninvited
he
has
already
dispatched
her
husband
he
it
is
whose
terrible
has
scattered
her
sisters
among
the
trees
of
the
forest
on
he
comes
with
confidence
and
a
brave
heart
seeking
one
more
bloody
one
more
feather
to
win
for
his
head
behold
he
lifts
above
her
woman
s
head
his
no
hope
no
chance
for
her
life
ah
he
strikes
beyond
her
only
the
handle
of
the
ax
falls
heavily
upon
her
tired
shoulder
her
ready
knife
finds
his
wicked
heart
down
he
falls
at
her
feet
now
the
din
of
war
grows
fainter
and
further
the
sioux
recover
heart
and
drive
the
enemy
headlong
from
their
lodges
your
sister
stands
victorious
over
three
she
takes
her
baby
boy
and
makes
him
count
with
his
tiny
hands
the
first
coup
on
each
dead
hero
hence
he
wears
the
first
feathers
while
yet
in
his
oaken
cradle
the
bravest
of
the
whole
sioux
nation
have
given
the
in
your
sister
s
honor
and
have
said
tis
eyatonkawee
who
is
not
satisfied
with
downing
the
mighty
oaks
with
her
ax
she
took
the
mighty
sacs
and
foxes
for
trees
and
she
felled
them
with
a
will
in
such
fashion
the
old
woman
was
wont
to
chant
her
story
and
not
a
warrior
there
could
tell
one
to
surpass
it
the
custom
was
strong
and
there
was
not
one
to
prevent
her
when
she
struck
open
with
a
single
blow
of
her
ax
the
keg
of
whisky
and
the
precious
liquor
trickled
upon
the
ground
so
trickles
under
the
ax
of
eyatonkawee
the
blood
of
an
enemy
to
the
sioux
vi
blue
sky
many
years
ago
a
large
body
of
the
sioux
were
encamped
at
midsummer
in
the
valley
of
the
cheyenne
it
was
customary
at
that
period
for
the
indians
to
tie
up
their
ponies
over
night
within
the
circle
of
the
teepees
whenever
they
were
in
disputed
territory
for
they
considered
it
no
wrong
to
steal
the
horses
of
the
enemy
hence
this
long
procession
of
young
men
and
maidens
returning
at
sunset
to
the
camp
with
great
bundles
of
green
grass
hanging
gracefully
from
their
saddles
the
green
grass
parade
became
a
regular
custom
and
in
fact
a
affair
since
it
was
found
to
afford
unusual
opportunities
for
courtship
blue
sky
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
sioux
chief
put
on
her
best
doeskin
gown
trimmed
with
elks
teeth
and
investing
her
favorite
spotted
pony
with
his
beaded
she
went
forth
in
company
with
one
of
her
maiden
friends
soon
two
young
warriors
overtook
the
pair
and
as
they
approached
they
covered
their
heads
with
their
robes
exposing
only
the
upper
part
of
the
face
disguised
with
paint
and
the
single
eagle
feather
standing
upright
one
carried
a
bow
and
quiver
full
of
arrows
the
other
a
suspended
from
his
right
arm
ah
hay
hun
hay
saluted
one
of
them
but
the
modest
maidens
said
never
a
word
it
was
not
their
way
to
speak
only
the
gay
calico
ponies
pranced
about
and
sportively
threw
back
their
ears
to
snap
at
the
horses
of
the
two
young
men
tis
a
brave
welcome
your
horses
are
giving
us
he
continued
while
the
two
girls
merely
looked
at
one
another
with
perfect
understanding
presently
matoska
urged
his
pony
close
to
the
blue
sky
s
side
it
may
be
that
i
am
overbold
he
murmured
in
her
ear
to
repeat
so
soon
my
tale
of
love
i
know
well
that
i
risk
a
reprimand
if
not
in
words
then
by
a
look
or
action
he
paused
to
note
the
effect
of
his
speech
but
alas
it
is
the
hard
rule
of
savage
courtship
that
the
maiden
may
with
propriety
and
dignity
keep
silence
as
long
as
she
wishes
and
it
is
often
exasperatingly
long
i
have
spoken
to
no
maiden
he
resumed
because
i
wished
to
win
the
before
doing
so
but
to
you
i
was
forced
to
yield
again
he
paused
as
if
fearing
to
appear
unduly
hasty
but
deliberate
as
were
speech
and
manner
his
eyes
betrayed
him
they
were
full
of
intense
eagerness
mingled
with
anxiety
sometimes
i
have
imagined
that
i
am
in
the
world
with
you
alone
traveling
over
the
prairie
of
life
or
sitting
in
our
lonely
white
teepee
as
the
oriole
sits
with
his
mate
before
their
swaying
home
yet
i
seemed
to
be
never
lonely
because
you
were
there
he
finished
his
plea
and
with
outward
calmness
awaited
her
reply
the
maiden
had
not
lost
a
word
but
she
was
still
thinking
she
thought
that
a
man
is
much
like
the
wind
of
the
north
only
pleasant
and
comfortable
in
midsummer
she
feared
that
she
might
some
time
have
to
furnish
all
the
fuel
for
their
love
s
fires
therefore
she
held
her
peace
matoska
waited
for
several
minutes
and
then
silently
withdrew
bearing
his
disappointment
with
dignity
meanwhile
the
camp
was
astir
with
the
returning
youths
and
maidens
their
horses
sides
fringed
with
the
long
meadow
grass
singing
plaintive
serenades
around
the
circular
rows
of
teepees
before
they
broke
up
for
the
night
it
was
a
clear
and
quiet
night
the
evening
fires
were
kindled
and
every
teepee
transformed
into
an
immense
chinese
lantern
there
was
a
glowing
ring
two
miles
in
circumference
with
the
wooded
river
bottom
on
one
side
and
the
vast
prairie
on
the
other
the
black
hills
loomed
up
in
the
distance
and
the
rapids
of
the
wild
cheyenne
sent
forth
a
varying
peal
of
music
on
the
wind
the
people
enjoyed
their
evening
meal
and
in
the
pauses
of
their
talk
and
laughter
the
ponies
could
be
heard
munching
at
the
bundles
of
green
grass
just
outside
the
teepees
suddenly
a
chorus
of
yells
broke
cruelly
the
peace
of
the
camp
followed
by
the
dashing
charge
of
the
crow
indian
horsemen
it
was
met
as
bravely
and
quickly
by
the
sioux
and
in
the
clear
pale
moonlight
the
dusky
warriors
fought
with
the
occasional
flash
of
a
firearm
while
silent
weapons
flew
thick
in
the
air
like
at
sunset
the
brave
mothers
wives
and
sisters
gave
their
shrill
to
inspire
their
men
and
show
the
enemy
that
even
the
sioux
women
can
not
be
daunted
by
such
a
fearful
surprise
when
the
morning
sun
sent
its
golden
shafts
among
the
teepees
they
saw
it
through
glistening
tears
happy
tears
they
said
because
the
brave
dead
had
met
their
end
in
gallant
fight
the
very
end
they
craved
and
among
those
who
fell
that
night
was
brave
hawk
the
handsome
brother
of
the
blue
sky
in
a
few
days
the
camp
was
moved
to
a
point
further
up
the
cheyenne
and
deeper
into
the
bosom
of
the
hills
leaving
behind
the
decorated
grave
lodges
belonging
to
the
honored
dead
a
great
council
teepee
was
pitched
and
here
the
people
met
to
credit
those
who
had
earned
them
with
the
honors
of
the
fight
that
they
might
thereafter
wear
the
eagle
feathers
which
they
had
won
the
first
honor
declared
the
master
of
ceremonies
belongs
to
brave
hawk
who
fell
in
the
battle
he
it
was
who
compelled
the
crows
to
retreat
when
he
bravely
charged
upon
them
and
knocked
from
his
horse
the
crow
chief
their
war
ho
it
is
true
exclaimed
the
warriors
in
chorus
the
second
honor
he
resumed
belongs
to
matoska
the
white
bear
hun
hun
hay
interposed
another
it
is
i
red
owl
who
touched
the
body
of
the
crow
chief
second
to
brave
hawk
it
was
a
definite
challenge
the
warriors
who
witnessed
the
act
give
the
coup
to
matoska
friend
persisted
the
spokesman
red
owl
was
a
brave
youth
and
a
close
rival
of
matoska
both
for
war
honors
and
for
the
hand
of
the
prettiest
maiden
in
the
tribe
he
had
hoped
to
be
recognized
as
one
who
fought
in
defense
of
their
homes
by
the
side
of
brave
hawk
that
would
please
the
blue
sky
he
thought
but
the
honor
was
conferred
upon
his
rival
there
was
a
cloud
of
suppressed
irritation
on
his
dusky
face
as
he
sullenly
departed
to
his
own
tent
an
action
which
displeased
the
matoska
had
not
spoken
and
this
caused
him
to
appear
to
the
better
advantage
the
worst
of
it
was
that
blue
sky
herself
had
entered
the
ring
with
the
orphan
steed
as
it
was
called
the
of
her
dead
brother
and
had
therefore
seen
and
heard
everything
tanagila
or
hummingbird
the
beautiful
charger
decorated
according
to
custom
with
the
honors
won
by
his
master
was
led
away
by
the
girl
amidst
resounding
unable
to
remain
quiet
red
owl
went
out
into
the
hills
to
fast
and
pray
it
was
sunset
of
the
next
day
when
he
again
approached
the
village
and
behind
a
little
ridge
came
suddenly
upon
matoska
and
the
girl
standing
together
it
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
met
since
the
green
grass
parade
and
now
only
by
accident
as
the
sister
of
brave
hawk
was
in
deep
mourning
however
the
lover
had
embraced
his
opportunity
and
the
maiden
had
said
that
she
was
willing
to
think
of
the
matter
no
more
words
were
spoken
that
very
night
the
council
drum
was
struck
three
times
followed
by
the
warriors
cheer
everybody
knew
what
that
meant
it
was
an
invitation
to
the
young
men
to
go
upon
the
against
the
crows
blue
sky
was
unconsciously
startled
by
this
sudden
announcement
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
a
fear
that
she
could
not
explain
the
truth
was
that
she
loved
and
was
not
yet
fully
aware
of
it
in
spite
of
her
fresh
grief
she
had
been
inexplicably
happy
since
her
last
meeting
with
matoska
for
she
had
seen
in
him
that
which
is
so
beautiful
so
compelling
in
man
to
the
eyes
of
the
woman
who
loves
he
too
now
cherished
a
real
hope
and
felt
as
if
he
could
rush
into
the
thickest
of
the
battle
to
avenge
the
brother
of
his
beloved
in
a
few
days
the
had
reached
the
big
horn
and
sent
out
advance
scouts
who
reported
a
large
crow
encampment
their
hundreds
of
horses
covered
the
flats
like
a
great
herd
of
buffalo
they
said
it
was
immediately
decided
to
attack
at
daybreak
and
on
a
given
signal
they
dashed
impetuously
upon
the
formidable
camp
some
stampeded
and
drove
off
a
number
of
horses
while
the
main
body
plunged
into
the
midst
of
the
crows
but
the
enemy
were
not
easily
surprised
they
knew
well
the
sioux
tactics
and
there
was
a
desperate
struggle
for
supremacy
was
raised
against
and
the
of
the
arrow
filled
the
air
presently
the
sioux
were
forced
to
retreat
with
the
crows
in
hot
pursuit
like
wolves
after
their
prey
red
owl
and
matoska
had
been
among
the
foremost
in
the
charge
and
now
they
acted
as
a
bravely
defending
the
retreat
of
their
little
army
to
the
admiration
of
the
enemy
at
last
a
crow
raised
his
spear
against
matoska
who
in
a
flash
dismounted
him
with
a
stroke
of
his
oaken
bow
but
alas
the
blow
snapped
the
and
left
him
defenseless
at
the
same
instant
his
horse
uttered
a
scream
and
fell
throwing
its
rider
headlong
there
was
no
one
near
except
red
owl
who
clapped
his
heels
to
his
pony
and
joined
in
the
retreat
leaving
matoska
behind
he
arose
threw
down
his
quiver
and
advanced
alone
to
meet
the
oncoming
rush
of
the
crows
the
sioux
had
seen
him
fall
in
a
few
moments
he
was
surrounded
by
the
enemy
and
they
saw
him
no
more
the
pursuit
was
stopped
and
they
paused
upon
a
hilltop
to
collect
the
remnant
of
their
force
red
owl
was
the
last
to
come
up
and
it
was
observed
that
he
did
not
look
like
himself
tell
us
what
were
matoska
s
last
words
they
asked
him
but
he
silently
dismounted
and
sent
an
arrow
through
his
faithful
steed
to
the
astonishment
of
the
warriors
immediately
afterward
he
took
out
his
knife
and
stabbed
himself
to
the
heart
ah
they
exclaimed
he
could
not
live
to
share
our
humiliation
the
returned
defeated
and
cast
down
by
this
unexpected
ending
to
their
adventure
having
lost
some
of
their
bravest
and
best
men
the
camp
was
instantly
thrown
into
mourning
many
were
in
heavy
grief
but
none
was
more
deeply
stricken
than
the
maiden
called
the
blue
sky
the
daughter
of
their
chief
she
remained
within
her
teepee
and
wept
in
secret
for
none
knew
that
she
had
the
right
to
mourn
yet
she
believed
that
her
lover
had
met
with
misfortune
but
not
death
although
his
name
was
announced
among
those
warriors
who
fell
in
the
field
her
own
heart
assured
her
that
it
was
not
so
i
must
go
to
him
she
said
to
herself
i
must
know
certainly
whether
he
is
still
among
the
living
the
next
evening
while
the
village
was
yet
in
the
confusion
of
great
trouble
and
sorrow
blue
sky
rode
out
upon
her
favorite
pony
as
if
to
take
him
to
water
as
usual
but
none
saw
her
return
she
hastened
to
the
spot
where
she
had
concealed
two
sacks
of
provisions
and
her
extra
moccasins
and
materials
for
sewing
she
had
no
weapon
save
her
knife
and
a
small
hatchet
she
knew
the
country
between
the
black
hills
and
the
big
horn
and
knew
that
it
was
full
of
perils
for
man
and
much
more
for
woman
yet
by
traveling
only
at
night
and
concealing
herself
in
the
daytime
she
hoped
to
avoid
these
dangers
and
she
rode
bravely
forth
on
the
trail
of
the
returning
warriors
her
dog
wapayna
had
followed
the
maiden
and
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
so
faithful
a
companion
she
cautioned
him
not
to
bark
at
or
attack
strange
animals
unless
they
attacked
first
and
he
seemed
to
understand
the
propriety
of
remaining
on
guard
whenever
his
mistress
was
asleep
she
reached
the
powder
river
country
in
safety
and
here
she
had
more
than
once
to
pick
her
way
among
the
buffaloes
these
wily
animals
seemed
to
realize
that
she
was
only
a
woman
and
unarmed
so
that
they
scarcely
kept
out
of
her
path
she
also
crossed
the
trails
of
riders
some
of
them
quite
fresh
but
was
fortunate
enough
not
to
meet
any
of
them
at
last
the
maiden
attained
the
divide
between
the
tongue
and
the
big
horn
rivers
her
heart
beat
fast
and
the
sudden
sense
of
her
strange
mission
almost
overwhelmed
her
she
remembered
the
only
time
in
her
life
that
the
sioux
were
upon
that
river
and
so
had
that
bit
of
friendly
welcome
from
the
valley
a
recollection
of
childhood
it
was
near
morning
the
moon
had
set
and
for
a
short
time
darkness
prevailed
but
the
girl
s
eyes
had
by
this
time
become
accustomed
to
the
dark
she
knew
the
day
was
at
hand
and
with
its
first
beams
she
was
safely
tucked
into
one
of
those
round
turns
left
by
the
river
long
ago
in
changing
its
bed
now
become
a
little
grassy
hollow
sheltered
by
steep
banks
and
hidden
by
a
fringe
of
trees
here
she
picketed
her
pony
and
took
her
own
rest
not
until
the
afternoon
shadows
were
long
did
she
awake
and
go
forth
with
determination
to
seek
for
the
battlefield
and
for
the
crow
encampment
it
was
not
long
before
she
came
upon
the
bodies
of
fallen
horses
and
men
there
was
matoska
s
white
charger
with
a
sioux
arrow
in
his
side
and
she
divined
the
treachery
of
red
owl
but
he
was
dead
and
his
death
had
atoned
for
the
crime
the
body
of
her
lover
was
nowhere
to
be
found
yet
how
should
they
have
taken
the
bravest
of
the
sioux
a
captive
if
he
had
but
one
arrow
left
he
would
stand
and
fight
if
his
were
broken
he
would
still
welcome
death
with
a
strong
heart
she
thought
the
evening
was
approaching
and
the
crow
village
in
plain
sight
blue
sky
arranged
her
hair
and
dress
as
well
as
she
could
like
that
of
a
crow
woman
and
with
an
extra
robe
she
made
for
herself
a
bundle
that
looked
as
if
it
held
a
baby
in
its
many
wrappings
the
community
was
still
celebrating
its
recent
victory
over
the
sioux
and
the
camp
was
alive
with
songs
and
dances
in
the
darkness
she
approached
unnoticed
and
singing
in
an
undertone
a
crow
lullaby
walked
back
and
forth
among
the
lodges
watching
eagerly
for
any
signs
of
him
she
sought
at
last
she
came
near
to
the
council
lodge
there
she
beheld
his
face
like
an
apparition
through
the
dusk
and
the
he
was
sitting
within
dressed
in
the
gala
costume
of
a
crow
o
he
is
living
he
is
living
thought
the
brave
maiden
o
what
shall
i
do
unconsciously
she
crept
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
sharp
eyes
of
an
indian
detected
the
slight
difference
in
her
manner
and
dress
and
he
at
once
gave
the
alarm
wah
wah
epsaraka
epsaraka
a
sioux
a
sioux
in
an
instant
the
whole
camp
had
surrounded
the
girl
who
stood
in
their
midst
a
prisoner
yet
undaunted
for
she
had
seen
her
lover
and
the
spirit
of
her
ancestors
rose
within
her
an
interpreter
was
brought
a
man
who
was
half
crow
and
half
sioux
young
and
pretty
daughter
of
the
sioux
exclaimed
the
chief
tell
us
how
you
came
here
in
our
midst
undetected
and
why
because
replied
the
blue
sky
your
brave
warriors
have
slain
my
only
brother
and
captured
my
lover
whom
you
now
hold
a
prisoner
it
is
for
his
sake
that
i
have
thus
risked
my
life
and
honor
ho
ho
you
are
the
bravest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
your
lover
was
betrayed
into
our
hands
by
the
treachery
of
one
of
his
own
tribe
who
shot
his
horse
from
behind
he
faced
us
without
fear
but
it
was
not
his
courage
that
saved
his
life
he
resembles
my
own
son
who
lately
fell
in
battle
and
according
to
the
custom
i
have
adopted
him
as
my
son
thus
the
brave
maiden
captured
the
heart
of
the
wily
crow
and
was
finally
allowed
to
return
home
with
her
lover
bearing
many
and
rich
presents
her
name
is
remembered
among
the
two
tribes
for
this
act
of
hers
resulted
in
a
treaty
of
peace
between
them
which
was
kept
for
a
generation

the
faithfulness
of
long
ears
away
beyond

thin
hills

upon

sioux
had
celebrated
their
sun
dance
some
forty
years
ago
it
was
midsummer
and
the
red
folk
were
happy
they
lacked
for
nothing
the
yellowish
green
flat
on

side
of

powder
was
studded
with
wild
flowers
and
the
cottonwood
trees
were
in

for

and
for
four
days
remained
near
the
old
place
the
party
that
went
west
did
not
fail
to
realize
the
perilous
nature
of
their
wanderings
for
they
were
trespassing
upon

country

warlike
crows

must
take
up

the
shunkaska
who
had
made
many
presents
at
the
dances
in
honor
of
her
twin
boys
now
gave
one
of
her
remaining
ponies
to
a
poor
old
woman
whose
only
beast
of
burden
a
large
dog
had
died
during
the
night
this
made
it
necessary
to
shift
the
packs
of
the
others
nakpa
or
long
ears
her
kittenlike
gray
mule
which
had
heretofore
been
honored
with
the
precious
burden
of
the
twin
babies
was
to
be
given
a
heavier
and
more
cumbersome
load
weeko
s
spotted
pony
was
selected
to
carry
the
babies
accordingly
the
two
children
in
their
gorgeously
beaded
buckskin
hoods
were
suspended
upon
either
side
of
the
pony
s
saddle
as
weeko
s
they
were
beautifully
dressed
even
the
saddle
and
bridle
were
daintily
worked
by
her
own
hands
the
caravan
was
now
in
motion
and
weeko
started
all
her
ponies
after
the
leader
while
she
adjusted
the
mule
s
clumsy
burden
of
kettles
and
other
household
gear
in
a
moment
go
on
let
us
see
how
you
move
with
your
new
load
go
on
she
exclaimed
again
with
a
light
blow
of
the
lariat
as
the
animal
stood
perfectly
still
nakpa
simply
gave
an
angry
side
glance
at
her
load
and
shifted
her
position
once
or
twice
then
she
threw
herself
headlong
into
the
air
and
landed
uttering
at
the
same
time
her
unearthly
protest
first
she
dove
straight
through
the
crowd
then
proceeded
in
a
circle
her
heels
describing
wonderful
curves
and
sweeps
in
the
air
her
pack
too
began
to
come
to
pieces
and
to
take
forced
flights
from
her
undignified
body
and
heels
in
the
midst
of
the
screams
of
women
and
children
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
of
the
amused
young
braves
the
cowskin
tent
became
detached
from
her
saddle
and
a
moment
later
nakpa
stood
free
her
sides
worked
like
a
bellows
as
she
stood
there
meekly
indignant
apparently
considering
herself
to
be
the
victim
of
an
misunderstanding
i
should
put
an
arrow
through
her
at
once
only
she
is
not
worth
a
good
arrow
said
shunkaska
or
white
dog
the
husband
of
weeko
at
his
wife
s
answer
he
opened
his
eyes
in
surprised
displeasure
no
she
shall
have
her
own
pack
again
she
wants
her
twins
i
ought
never
to
have
taken
them
from
her
weeko
approached
nakpa
as
she
stood
alone
and
unfriended
in
the
face
of
her
little
world
all
of
whom
considered
that
she
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
as
for
her
she
evidently
felt
that
her
misfortunes
had
not
been
of
her
own
making
she
gave
a
hesitating
sidelong
look
at
her
mistress
nakpa
you
should
not
have
acted
so
i
knew
you
were
stronger
than
the
others
therefore
i
gave
you
that
load
said
weeko
in
a
conciliatory
tone
and
patted
her
on
the
nose
come
now
you
shall
have
your
own
pet
pack
and
she
led
her
back
to
where
the
young
pony
stood
silently
with
the
babies
nakpa
threw
back
her
ears
and
cast
savage
looks
at
him
while
shunkaska
with
no
small
annoyance
gathered
together
as
much
as
he
could
of
their
scattered
household
effects
the
sleeping
babies
in
their
hoods
were
gently
lowered
from
the
pony
s
back
and
attached
securely
to
nakpa
s
padded
wooden
saddle
the
family
pots
and
kettles
were
divided
among
the
pack
ponies
order
was
restored
and
the
village
once
more
in
motion
come
now
nakpa
you
have
your
wish
you
must
take
good
care
of
my
babies
be
good
because
i
have
trusted
you
murmured
the
young
mother
in
her
softest
tones
really
weeko
you
have
some
common
ground
with
nakpa
for
you
both
always
want
to
have
your
own
way
and
stick
to
it
too
i
tell
you
i
fear
this
long
ears
she
is
not
to
be
trusted
with
babies
remarked
shunkaska
with
a
good
deal
of
severity
but
his
wife
made
no
reply
for
she
well
knew
that
though
he
might
criticise
he
would
not
actually
interfere
with
her
domestic
arrangements
he
now
started
ahead
to
join
the
men
in
advance
of
the
procession
thus
leaving
her
in
undivided
charge
of
her
household
one
or
two
of
the
pack
ponies
were
not
and
required
all
her
attention
nakpa
had
been
a
faithful
servant
until
her
escapade
of
the
morning
and
she
was
now
obviously
satisfied
with
her
mistress
arrangements
she
walked
alongside
with
her
lariat
dragging
and
perfectly
free
to
do
as
she
pleased
some
hours
later
the
party
ascended
a
slope
from
the
river
bottom
to
cross
over
the
divide
which
lay
between
the
powder
river
and
a
tributary
stream
they
had
hitherto
followed
that
river
in
a
westerly
direction
but
here
it
took
its
course
southward
winding
in
a
blue
streak
until
lost
to
view
among
the
of
the
big
horn
mountains
the
ford
was
deep
with
a
swift
current
here
and
there
a
bald
butte
stood
out
in
full
relief
against
the
brilliant
blue
sky
the
sioux
followed
a
deep
ravine
until
they
came
almost
up
to
the
second
row
of
terraces
whoo
whoo
came
the
signal
of
danger
from
the
front
it
was
no
unfamiliar
sound
the
rovers
knew
it
only
too
well
it
meant
sudden
death
or
at
best
a
cruel
struggle
and
frantic
flight
terrified
yet
the
women
turned
to
fly
while
yet
there
was
time
instantly
the
mother
looked
to
nakpa
who
carried
on
either
side
of
the
saddle
her
precious
boys
she
hurriedly
examined
the
fastenings
to
see
that
all
was
secure
and
then
caught
her
swiftest
pony
for
like
all
indian
women
she
knew
just
what
was
happening
and
that
while
her
husband
was
engaged
in
front
with
the
enemy
she
must
seek
safety
with
her
babies
hardly
was
she
in
the
saddle
when
a
heartrending
sounded
on
their
flank
and
she
knew
that
they
were
surrounded
instinctively
she
reached
for
her
husband
s
second
quiver
of
arrows
which
was
carried
by
one
of
the
pack
ponies
alas
the
crow
warriors
were
already
upon
them
the
ponies
became
unmanageable
and
the
wild
screams
of
women
and
children
pierced
the
awful
confusion
quick
as
a
flash
weeko
turned
again
to
her
babies
but
nakpa
had
already
disappeared
then
maddened
by
fright
and
the
loss
of
her
children
weeko
became
forgetful
of
her
sex
and
tenderness
for
she
sternly
grasped
her
husband
s
bow
in
her
left
hand
to
do
battle
that
charge
of
the
crows
was
a
disastrous
one
but
the
sioux
were
equally
brave
and
desperate
charges
and
were
made
and
the
slain
were
many
on
both
sides
the
fight
lasted
until
darkness
came
then
the
crows
departed
and
the
sioux
buried
their
dead
when
the
crows
made
their
flank
charge
nakpa
apparently
appreciated
the
situation
to
save
herself
and
the
babies
she
took
a
desperate
chance
she
fled
straight
through
the
attacking
force
when
the
warriors
came
howling
upon
her
in
great
numbers
she
at
once
started
back
the
way
she
had
come
to
the
camp
left
behind
they
had
traveled
nearly
three
days
to
be
sure
they
did
not
travel
more
than
fifteen
miles
a
day
but
it
was
full
forty
miles
to
cover
before
dark
look
look
exclaimed
a
warrior
two
babies
hung
from
the
saddle
of
a
mule
no
one
heeded
this
man
s
call
and
his
arrow
did
not
touch
nakpa
or
either
of
the
boys
but
it
struck
the
thick
part
of
the
saddle
over
the
mule
s
back
lasso
her
lasso
her
he
yelled
once
more
but
nakpa
was
too
cunning
for
them
she
dodged
in
and
out
with
active
heels
and
they
could
not
afford
to
waste
many
arrows
on
a
mule
at
that
stage
of
the
fight
down
the
ravine
then
over
the
expanse
of
prairie
dotted
with
she
sped
with
her
unconscious
burden
whoo
whoo
yelled
another
crow
to
his
comrades
the
sioux
have
dispatched
a
runner
to
get
reinforcements
there
he
goes
down
on
the
flat
now
he
has
almost
reached
the
river
bottom
it
was
only
nakpa
she
laid
back
her
cars
and
stretched
out
more
and
more
to
gain
the
river
for
she
realized
that
when
she
had
crossed
the
ford
the
crows
would
not
pursue
her
farther
now
she
had
reached
the
bank
with
the
intense
heat
from
her
exertions
she
was
extremely
nervous
and
she
imagined
a
warrior
behind
every
bush
yet
she
had
enough
sense
left
to
realize
that
she
must
not
satisfy
her
thirst
she
tried
the
bottom
with
her
then
waded
carefully
into
the
deep
stream
she
kept
her
big
ears
well
to
the
front
as
she
swam
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
as
she
stepped
on
the
opposite
shore
she
shook
herself
and
the
boys
vigorously
then
pulled
a
few
mouthfuls
of
grass
and
started
on
soon
one
of
the
babies
began
to
cry
and
the
other
was
not
long
in
joining
him
nakpa
did
not
know
what
to
do
she
gave
a
gentle
whinny
and
both
babies
apparently
stopped
to
listen
then
she
took
up
an
easy
gait
as
if
to
put
them
to
sleep
these
tactics
answered
only
for
a
time
as
she
fairly
flew
over
the
lowlands
the
babies
hunger
increased
and
they
screamed
so
loud
that
a
passing
coyote
had
to
sit
upon
his
haunches
and
wonder
what
in
the
world
the
fleeing
longeared
horse
was
carrying
on
his
saddle
even
magpies
and
crows
flew
near
as
if
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
this
curious
sound
nakpa
now
came
to
the
little
trail
creek
a
tributary
of
the
powder
not
far
from
the
old
camp
no
need
of
wasting
any
time
here
she
thought
then
she
swerved
aside
so
suddenly
as
almost
to
jerk
her
babies
out
of
their
cradles
two
gray
wolves
one
on
each
side
approached
her
growling
low
their
white
teeth
showing
never
in
her
humble
life
had
nakpa
been
in
more
desperate
straits
the
larger
of
the
wolves
came
fiercely
forward
to
engage
her
attention
while
his
mate
was
to
attack
her
behind
and
cut
her
hamstrings
but
for
once
the
pair
had
made
a
miscalculation
the
mule
used
her
front
hoofs
vigorously
on
the
foremost
wolf
while
her
hind
ones
were
doing
even
more
effective
work
the
larger
wolf
soon
went
limping
away
with
a
broken
hip
and
the
one
in
the
rear
received
a
deep
cut
on
the
jaw
which
proved
an
effectual
discouragement
a
little
further
on
an
indian
hunter
drew
near
on
horseback
but
nakpa
did
not
pause
or
slacken
her
pace
on
she
fled
through
the
long
dry
grass
of
the
river
bottoms
while
her
babies
slept
again
from
sheer
exhaustion
toward
sunset
she
entered
the
sioux
camp
amid
great
excitement
for
some
one
had
spied
her
afar
off
and
the
boys
and
the
dogs
announced
her
coming
whoo
whoo
weeko
s
nakpa
has
come
back
with
the
twins
whoo
whoo
exclaimed
the
men
tokee
tokee
cried
the
women
a
sister
to
weeko
who
was
in
the
village
came
forward
and
released
the
children
as
nakpa
gave
a
low
whinny
and
stopped
tenderly
zeezeewin
nursed
them
at
her
own
motherly
bosom
assisted
by
another
young
mother
of
the
band
ugh
there
is
a
crow
arrow
sticking
in
the
saddle
a
fight
a
fight
exclaimed
the
warriors
sing
a
song
for
the
one
she
has
escaped
alone
with
her
charge
she
is
entitled
to
wear
an
eagle
s
feather
look
at
the
arrow
in
her
saddle
and
more
she
has
a
knife
wound
in
her
jaw
and
an
arrow
cut
on
her
hind
no
those
are
the
marks
of
a
wolf
s
teeth
she
has
passed
through
many
dangers
and
saved
two
chief
s
sons
who
will
some
day
make
the
crows
sorry
for
this
day
s
work
the
speaker
was
an
old
man
who
thus
addressed
the
fast
gathering
throng
zeezeewin
now
came
forward
again
with
an
eagle
feather
and
some
white
paint
in
her
hands
the
young
men
rubbed
nakpa
down
and
the
feather
marked
with
red
to
indicate
her
wounds
was
fastened
to
her
mane
shoulders
and
hips
were
touched
with
red
paint
to
show
her
endurance
in
running
then
the
crier
praising
her
brave
deed
in
heroic
verse
led
her
around
the
camp
inside
of
the
circle
of
teepees
all
the
people
stood
outside
their
lodges
and
listened
respectfully
for
the
dakota
loves
well
to
honor
the
faithful
and
the
brave
during
the
next
day
riders
came
in
from
the
party
bringing
the
sad
news
of
the
fight
and
heavy
loss
late
in
the
afternoon
came
weeko
her
face
swollen
with
crying
her
beautiful
hair
cut
short
in
mourning
her
garments
torn
and
covered
with
dust
and
blood
her
husband
had
fallen
in
the
fight
and
her
twin
boys
she
supposed
to
have
been
taken
captive
by
the
crows
singing
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
praises
of
her
departed
warrior
she
entered
the
camp
as
she
approached
her
sister
s
teepee
there
stood
nakpa
still
wearing
her
honorable
decorations
at
the
same
moment
zeezeewin
came
out
to
meet
her
with
both
babies
in
her
arms
mechinkshee

my

my
sons
was
all
that
the
poor
mother
could
say
as
she
all
but
fell
from
her
saddle
to
the
ground
the
despised
long

had
not
betrayed
her
trust
viii
the
war
maiden
the
old
man
smoky
day
was
for
many
years
the
and
historian
of
his
tribe
he
it
was
who
told
me
the
story
of
the
war
maiden
in
the
old
days
it
was
unusual
but
not
unheard
of
for
a
woman
to
go
upon
the
perhaps
a
young
girl
the
last
of
her
line
or
a
widow
whose
husband
had
fallen
on
the
field
and
there
could
be
no
greater
incentive
to
feats
of
desperate
daring
on
the
part
of
the
warriors
a
long
time
ago
said
old
smoky
day
the
unkpapa
and
the
bands
of
sioux
united
their
camps
upon
a
vast
prairie
east
of
the
minne
wakan
now
called
devil
s
lake
it
was
midsummer
and
the
people
shared
in
the
happiness
of
every
living
thing
we
had
food
in
abundance
for
bison
in
countless
numbers
overspread
the
plain
the
teepee
village
was
laid
out
in
two
great
rings
and
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
midsummer
entertainments
there
were
ball
games
feasts
and
dances
every
day
and
late
into
the
night
you
have
heard
of
the
festivities
of
those
days
there
are
none
like
them
now
said
the
old
man
and
he
sighed
heavily
as
he
laid
down
the
red
pipe
which
was
to
be
passed
from
hand
to
hand
during
the
recital
the
head
chief
of
the
unkpapas
then
was
tamakoche
his
country
he
was
in
his
time
a
notable
warrior
a
hunter
and
a
feastmaker
much
beloved
by
his
people
he
was
the
father
of
three
sons
but
he
was
so
anxious
to
make
them
warriors
of
great
reputation
that
they
had
all
despising
danger
been
killed
in
battle
the
chief
had
also
a
very
pretty
daughter
whose
name
was
makatah
since
all
his
sons
were
slain
he
had
placed
his
affections
solely
upon
the
girl
and
she
grew
up
listening
to
the
praises
of
the
brave
deeds
of
her
brothers
which
her
father
never
tired
of
chanting
when
they
were
together
in
the
lodge
at
times
makatah
was
called
upon
to
dance
to
the
songs
thus
even
as
a
child
she
loved
the
thought
of
war
although
she
was
the
prettiest
and
most
modest
maiden
in
the
two
tribes
as
she
grew
into
womanhood
she
became
the
belle
of
her
father
s
village
and
her
beauty
and
spirit
were
talked
of
even
among
the
neighboring
bands
of
sioux
but
it
appeared
that
makatah
did
not
care
to
marry
she
had
only
two
ambitions
one
was
to
prove
to
her
father
that
though
only
a
maid
she
had
the
heart
of
a
warrior
the
other
was
to
visit
the
graves
of
her
brothers
that
is
the
country
of
the
enemy
at
this
pleasant
reunion
of
two
kindred
peoples
one
of
the
principal
events
was
the
feast
of
virgins
given
by
makatah
all
young
maidens
of
virtue
and
good
repute
were
invited
to
be
present
but
woe
to
her
who
should
dare
to
pollute
the
sacred
feast
if
her
right
to
be
there
were
challenged
by
any
it
meant
a
public
disgrace
the
two
arrows
and
the
red
stone
upon
which
the
virgins
took
their
oath
of
chastity
were
especially
prepared
for
the
occasion
every
girl
was
beautifully
dressed
for
at
that
time
the
white
doeskin
gowns
with
a
profusion
of
fringes
and
colored
embroidery
were
the
gala
attire
of
the
sioux
maidens
red
paint
was
added
and
ornaments
of
furs
and
wampum
many
youths
eagerly
surveyed
the
maiden
gathering
at
which
the
daughter
of
tamakoche
outshone
all
the
rest
several
eligible
warriors
now
pressed
their
suits
at
the
chieftain
s
lodge
and
among
them
were
one
or
two
whom
he
would
have
gladly
called
but
no
makatah
would
not
listen
to
words
of
courtship
she
had
vowed
she
said
to
the
spirits
of
her
three
brothers
each
of
whom
fell
in
the
country
of
the
crows
that
she
would
see
that
country
before
she
became
a
wife
red
horn
who
was
something
of
a
leader
among
the
young
men
was
a
persistent
and
determined
suitor
he
had
urged
every
influential
friend
of
his
and
hers
to
persuade
her
to
listen
to
him
his
presents
were
more
valuable
than
those
of
any
one
else
he
even
made
use
of
his
father
s
position
as
a
leading
chief
of
the
band
to
force
a
decision
in
his
favor
and
while
the
maiden
remained
indifferent
her
father
seemed
inclined
to
countenance
this
young
man
s
pretensions
she
had
many
other
lovers
as
i
have
said
the
old
man
added
and
among
them
was
one
little
eagle
an
orphan
and
a
poor
young
man
unknown
and
unproved
as
a
warrior
he
was
so
insignificant
that
nobody
thought
much
about
him
and
if
makatah
regarded
him
with
any
favor
the
matter
was
her
secret
for
it
is
certain
that
she
did
not
openly
encourage
him
one
day
it
was
reported
in
the
village
that
their
neighbors
the
sioux
would
organize
a
great
attack
upon
the
crows
at
the
mouth
of
the
redwater
a
tributary
of
the
missouri
makatah
immediately
inquired
of
her
male
cousins
whether
any
of
them
expected
to
join
the
three
of
us
will
go
they
replied
then
said
the
girl
i
beg
that
you
will
allow
me
to
go
with
you
i
have
a
good
horse
and
i
shall
not
handicap
you
in
battle
i
only
ask
your
protection
in
camp
as
your
kinswoman
and
a
maid
of
the
if
our
uncle
tamakoche
sanctions
your
going
they
replied
we
shall
be
proud
to
have
our
cousin
with
us
to
inspire
us
to
brave
deeds
the
maiden
now
sought
her
father
and
asked
his
permission
to
accompany
the
warparty
i
wish
said
she
to
visit
the
graves
of
my
brothers
i
shall
carry
with
me
their
and
their
weapons
to
give
to
certain
young
men
on
the
eve
of
battle
according
to
the
ancient
custom
long
ago
i
resolved
to
do
this
and
the
time
is
now
the
chief
was
at
this
time
well
advanced
in
years
and
had
been
sitting
quite
alone
in
his
lodge
thinking
upon
the
days
of
his
youth
when
he
was
noted
for
daring
and
success
in
battle
in
silence
he
listened
as
he
filled
his
pipe
and
seemed
to
meditate
while
he
smoked
the
fragrant
tobacco
at
last
he
spoke
with
tears
in
his
eyes
daughter
i
am
an
old
man
my
heart
beats
in
my
throat
and
my
old
eyes
can
not
keep
back
the
tears
my
three
sons
on
whom
i
had
placed
all
my
hopes
are
gone
to
a
far
country
you
are
the
only
child
left
to
my
old
age
and
you
too
are
brave
as
brave
as
any
of
your
brothers
if
you
go
i
fear
that
you
may
not
return
to
me
yet
i
can
not
refuse
you
my
permission
the
old
man
began
to
chant
a
and
some
of
his
people
hearing
him
came
in
to
learn
what
was
in
his
mind
he
told
them
all
and
immediately
many
young
men
volunteered
for
the
in
order
to
have
the
honor
of
going
with
the
daughter
of
their
chief
several
of
makatah
s
suitors
were
among
them
and
each
watched
eagerly
for
an
opportunity
to
ride
at
her
side
at
night
she
pitched
her
little
teepee
within
the
circle
of
her
cousins
campfires
and
there
she
slept
without
fear
courteous
youths
brought
to
her
every
morning
and
evening
fresh
venison
for
her
repast
yet
there
was
no
courting
for
all
attentions
paid
to
a
maiden
when
on
the
must
be
those
of
a
brother
to
a
sister
and
all
must
be
equally
received
by
her
two
days
later
when
the
two
parties
of
sioux
met
on
the
plains
the
maiden
s
presence
was
heralded
throughout
the
camp
as
an
inspiration
to
the
young
and
untried
warriors
of
both
bands
to
distinguish
themselves
in
the
field
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
older
men
considered
it
unwise
to
allow
makatah
to
accompany
the
the
girl
said
they
to
one
another
is
very
ambitious
as
well
as
brave
she
will
surely
risk
her
own
life
in
battle
which
will
make
the
young
men
desperate
and
we
shall
lose
many
of
them
nevertheless
they
loved
her
and
her
father
therefore
they
did
not
protest
openly
on
the
third
day
the
sioux
scouts
returned
with
the
word
that
the
crows
were
camping
as
had
been
supposed
at
the
confluence
of
the
redwater
and
the
missouri
rivers
it
was
a
great
camp
all
the
crow
tribe
were
there
they
said
with
their
thousands
of
fine
horses
there
was
excitement
in
the
sioux
camp
and
all
of
the
head
men
immediately
met
in
council
it
was
determined
to
make
the
attack
early
on
the
following
morning
just
as
the
sun
came
over
the
hills
the
councilors
agreed
that
in
honor
of
the
great
chief
her
father
as
well
as
in
recognition
of
her
own
courage
makatah
should
be
permitted
to
lead
the
charge
at
the
outset
but
that
she
must
drop
behind
as
they
neared
the
enemy
the
maiden
who
had
one
of
the
fleetest
ponies
in
that
part
of
the
country
had
no
intention
of
falling
back
but
she
did
not
tell
any
one
what
was
in
her
mind
that
evening
every
warrior
sang
his
warsong
and
announced
the
particular
or
medicine
of
his
clan
according
to
the
custom
the
youths
were
vying
with
one
another
in
brave
tales
of
what
they
would
do
on
the
morrow
the
voice
of
red
horn
was
loud
among
the
boasters
for
he
was
known
to
be
a
vain
youth
although
truly
not
without
reputation
little
eagle
who
was
also
of
the
company
remained
modestly
silent
as
indeed
became
one
without
experience
in
the
field
in
the
midst
of
the
clamor
there
fell
a
silence
hush
hush
they
whispered
look
look
the
war
maiden
comes
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
makatah
who
rode
her
fine
buckskin
steed
with
a
single
lariat
he
held
his
head
proudly
and
his
saddle
was
heavy
with
fringes
and
gay
with
colored
embroidery
the
maiden
was
attired
in
her
best
and
wore
her
own
father
s
while
she
carried
in
her
hands
two
which
had
belonged
to
two
of
her
dead
brothers
singing
in
a
clear
voice
the
songs
of
her
clan
she
completed
the
circle
according
to
custom
before
she
singled
out
one
of
the
young
braves
for
special
honor
by
giving
him
the
bonnet
which
she
held
in
her
right
hand
she
then
crossed
over
to
the
and
presented
the
other
bonnet
to
one
of
their
young
men
she
was
very
handsome
even
the
old
men
s
blood
was
stirred
by
her
brave
appearance
at
daybreak
the
two
of
the
sioux
mounted
on
their
best
horses
stood
side
by
side
ready
for
the
word
to
charge
all
of
the
warriors
were
painted
for
the
battle
prepared
for
death
their
nearly
nude
bodies
decorated
with
their
individual
their
quivers
were
fastened
to
their
sides
and
each
tightly
grasped
his
oaken
bow
the
young
man
with
the
finest
voice
had
been
chosen
to
give
the
signal
a
single
highpitched
yell
this
was
an
imitation
of
the
one
long
howl
of
the
gray
wolf
before
he
makes
the
attack
it
was
an
ancient
custom
of
our
people
at
last
it
came
as
the
sound
ceased
a
shrill
from
five
hundred
throats
burst
forth
in
chorus
and
at
the
same
instant
makatah
upon
her
splendid
buckskin
pony
shot
far
out
upon
the
plain
like
an
arrow
as
it
leaves
the
bow
it
was
a
glorious
sight
no
man
has
ever
looked
upon
the
like
again
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
sparkled
as
he
spoke
and
his
bent
shoulders
straightened
the
white
doeskin
gown
of
the
war
maiden
he
continued
was
trimmed
with
elk
s
teeth
and
tails
of
ermine
her
long
black
hair
hung
loose
bound
only
with
a
strip
of
and
with
her
floated
far
behind
in
her
hand
she
held
a
long
decorated
with
thus
she
went
forth
in
advance
of
them
all
war
cries
of
men
and
screams
of
terrified
women
and
children
were
borne
upon
the
clear
morning
air
as
our
warriors
neared
the
crow
camp
the
charge
was
made
over
a
wide
plain
and
the
crows
came
yelling
from
their
lodges
fully
armed
to
meet
the
attacking
party
in
spite
of
the
surprise
they
easily
held
their
own
and
even
began
to
press
us
hard
as
their
number
was
much
greater
than
that
of
the
sioux
the
fight
was
a
long
and
hard
one
toward
the
end
of
the
day
the
enemy
made
a
by
that
time
many
of
our
ponies
had
fallen
or
were
exhausted
the
sioux
retreated
and
the
slaughter
was
great
the
fled
womanlike
but
the
people
of
tamakoche
fought
gallantly
to
the
very
last
makatah
remained
with
her
father
s
people
many
cried
out
to
her
go
back
go
back
but
she
paid
no
attention
she
carried
no
weapon
throughout
the
day
nothing
but
her
but
by
her
presence
and
her
cries
of
encouragement
or
praise
she
urged
on
the
men
to
deeds
of
desperate
valor
finally
however
the
sioux
braves
were
hotly
pursued
and
the
retreat
became
general
now
at
last
makatah
tried
to
follow
but
her
pony
was
tired
and
the
maiden
fell
farther
and
farther
behind
many
of
her
lovers
passed
her
silently
intent
upon
saving
their
own
lives
only
a
few
still
remained
behind
fighting
desperately
to
cover
the
retreat
when
red
horn
came
up
with
the
girl
his
pony
was
still
fresh
he
might
have
put
her
up
behind
him
and
carried
her
to
safety
but
he
did
not
even
look
at
her
as
he
galloped
by
makatah
did
not
call
out
but
she
could
not
help
looking
after
him
he
had
declared
his
love
for
her
more
loudly
than
any
of
the
others
and
she
now
gave
herself
up
to
die
presently
another
overtook
the
maiden
it
was
little
eagle
unhurt
and
smiling
take
my
horse
he
said
to
her
i
shall
remain
here
and
fight
the
maiden
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
but
he
sprang
off
and
lifted
her
upon
his
horse
he
struck
him
a
smart
blow
upon
the
flank
that
sent
him
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
the
sioux
encampment
then
he
seized
the
exhausted
buckskin
by
the
lariat
and
turned
back
to
join
the
that
little
group
still
withstood
in
some
fashion
the
all
but
irresistible
onset
of
the
crows
when
their
comrade
came
back
to
them
leading
the
war
maiden
s
pony
they
were
inspired
to
fresh
endeavor
and
though
few
in
number
they
made
a
with
such
fury
that
the
crows
in
their
turn
were
forced
to
retreat
the
sioux
got
fresh
mounts
and
returned
to
the
field
and
by
sunset
the
day
was
won
little
eagle
was
among
the
first
who
rode
straight
through
the
crow
camp
causing
terror
and
consternation
it
was
afterward
remembered
that
he
looked
unlike
his
former
self
and
was
scarcely
recognized
by
the
warriors
for
the
modest
youth
they
had
so
little
regarded
it
was
this
famous
battle
which
drove
that
warlike
nation
the
crows
to
go
away
from
the
missouri
and
to
make
their
home
up
the
yellowstone
river
and
in
the
bighorn
country
but
many
of
our
men
fell
and
among
them
the
brave
little
eagle
the
sun
was
almost
over
the
hills
when
the
sioux
gathered
about
their
campfires
recounting
the
honors
won
in
battle
and
naming
the
brave
dead
then
came
the
singing
of
dirges
and
weeping
for
the
slain
the
sadness
of
loss
was
mingled
with
exultation
hush
listen
the
singing
and
wailing
have
ceased
suddenly
at
both
camps
there
is
one
voice
coming
around
the
circle
of
campfires
it
is
the
voice
of
a
woman
stripped
of
all
her
ornaments
her
dress
shorn
of
its
fringes
her
ankles
bare
her
hair
cropped
close
to
her
neck
leading
a
pony
with
mane
and
tail
cut
short
she
is
mourning
as
widows
mourn
it
is
makatah
publicly
with
many
tears
she
declared
herself
the
widow
of
the
brave
little
eagle
although
she
had
never
been
his
wife
he
it
was
she
said
with
truth
who
had
saved
her
people
s
honor
and
her
life
at
the
cost
of
his
own
he
was
a
true
man
ho
ho
was
the
response
from
many
of
the
older
warriors
but
the
young
men
the
lovers
of
makatah
were
surprised
and
sat
in
silence
the
war
maiden
lived
to
be
a
very
old
woman
but
she
remained
true
to
her
vow
she
never
accepted
a
husband
and
all
her
lifetime
she
was
known
as
the
widow
