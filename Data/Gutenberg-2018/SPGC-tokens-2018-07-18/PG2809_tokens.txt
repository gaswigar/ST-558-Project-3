to
my
father
and
mother
whose
pilgrimage
on
the
road
of
life
has
brought
them
only
toil
and
deprivation
this
book
of
stories
is
dedicated
by
a
son
to
whom
every
day
brings
a
deepening
sense
of
his
parents
silent
heroism
the
road
in
the
west
as
everywhere
is
hot
and
dusty
in
summer
and
desolate
and
drear
with
mud
in
fall
and
spring
and
in
winter
the
winds
sweep
the
snow
across
it
but
it
does
sometimes
cross
a
rich
meadow
where
the
songs
of
the
larks
and
bobolinks
and
blackbirds
are
tangled
follow
it
far
enough
it
may
lead
past
a
bend
in
the
river
where
the
water
laughs
eternally
over
its
shallows
mainly
it
is
long
and
wearyful
and
has
a
dull
little
town
at
one
end
and
a
home
of
toil
at
the
other
like
the

foreword
in
the
summer
of
after
having
been
three
years
in
boston
and
six
years
absent
from
my
old
home
in
northern
iowa
i
found
myself
with
money
enough
to
pay
my
railway
fare
to
ordway
south
dakota
where
my
father
and
mother
were
living
and
as
it
cost
very
little
extra
to
go
by
way
of
dubuque
and
charles
city
i
planned
to
visit
osage
iowa
and
the
farm
we
had
opened
on
dry
run
prairie
in
up
to
this
time
i
had
written
only
a
few
poems
and
some
articles
descriptive
of
boy
life
on
the
prairie
although
i
was
doing
a
good
deal
of
thinking
and
lecturing
on
land
reform
and
was
regarded
as
a
very
intense
disciple
of
herbert
spencer
and
henry
george
a
singular
combination
as
i
see
it
now
on
my
way
westward
that
summer
day
in
rural
life
presented
itself
from
an
entirely
new
angle
the
ugliness
the
endless
drudgery
and
the
loneliness
of
the
farmer
lot
smote
me
with
stern
insistence
i
was
the
militant
reformer
the
farther
i
got
from
chicago
the
more
depressing
the
landscape
became
it
was
bad
enough
in
our
former
home
in
mitchell
county
but
my
pity
grew
more
intense
as
i
passed
from
northwest
iowa
into
southern
dakota
the
houses
bare
as
boxes
dropped
on
the
treeless
plains
the
fences
running
at
right
angles
and
the
towns
mere
assemblages
of
flimsy
wooden
sheds
with
battlement
produced
on
me
the
effect
of
an
almost
helpless
and
sterile
poverty
my
dark
mood
was
deepened
into
bitterness
by
my
father
farm
where
i
found
my
mother
imprisoned
in
a
small
cabin
on
the
enormous
sunburned
treeless
plain
with
no
expectation
of
ever
living
anywhere
else
deserted
by
her
sons
and
failing
in
health
she
endured
the
discomforts
of
her
life
uncomplainingly
but
my
resentment
of
things
as
they
are
deepened
during
my
talks
with
her
neighbors
who
were
all
housed
in
the
same
unshaded
cabins
in
equal
poverty
and
loneliness
the
fact
that
at
i
was
without
power
to
aid
my
mother
in
any
substantial
way
added
to
my
despairing
mood
my
savings
for
the
two
years
of
my
teaching
in
boston
were
not
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
purchase
my
return
ticket
and
when
my
father
offered
me
a
stacker
wages
in
the
harvest
field
i
accepted
and
for
two
weeks
or
more
proved
my
worth
with
the
fork
which
was
still
mightier
with
me
than
the
pen
however
i
did
not
entirely
neglect
the
pen
in
spite
of
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
wheat
ricks
i
dreamed
of
poems
and
stories
my
mind
teemed
with
subjects
for
fiction
and
one
sunday
morning
i
set
to
work
on
a
story
which
had
been
suggested
to
me
by
a
talk
with
my
mother
and
a
few
hours
later
i
read
to
her
seated
on
the
low
sill
of
that
treeless
cottage
the
first
two
thousand
words
of
ripley
trip
the
first
of
the
series
of
sketches
which
became
main
travelled
roads
i
did
not
succeed
in
finishing
it
however
till
after
my
return
to
boston
in
september
during
the
fall
and
winter
of
and
the
winter
and
spring
of
i
wrote
the
most
of
the
stories
in
main
travelled
roads
a
novelette
for
the
century
magazine
and
a
play
called
under
the
wheel
the
actual
work
of
the
composition
was
carried
on
in
the
south
attic
room
of
doctor
cross
house
at
seaverns
avenue
jamaica
plain
the
mood
of
bitterness
in
which
these
books
were
written
was
renewed
and
augmented
by
a
second
visit
to
my
parents
in
for
during
my
stay
my
mother
suffered
a
stroke
of
paralysis
due
to
overwork
and
the
dreadful
heat
of
the
summer
she
grew
better
before
the
time
came
for
me
to
return
to
my
teaching
in
boston
but
i
felt
like
a
sneak
as
i
took
my
way
to
the
train
leaving
my
mother
and
sister
on
that
bleak
and
plain
old
paps
flaxen
jason
edwards
a
spoil
of
office
and
most
of
the
stories
gathered
into
the
second
volume
of
main
travelled
roads
were
written
in
the
shadow
of
these
defeats
if
they
seem
unduly
austere
let
the
reader
remember
the
times
in
which
they
were
composed
that
they
were
true
of
the
farms
of
that
day
no
one
can
know
better
than
i
for
i
was
there
a
farmer
life
on
the
farms
of
iowa
and
wisconsin
even
on
the
farms
of
dakota
has
gained
in
beauty
and
security
i
will
admit
but
there
are
still
wide
stretches
of
territory
in
kansas
and
nebraska
where
the
farmhouse
is
a
lonely
shelter
groves
and
lawns
better
roads
the
rural
free
delivery
the
telephone
and
the
motor
car
have
done
much
to
bring
the
farmer
into
a
frame
of
mind
where
he
is
contented
with
his
lot
but
much
remains
to
be
done
before
the
stream
of
young
life
from
the
country
to
the
city
can
be
checked
the
two
volumes
of
main
travelled
roads
can
now
be
taken
to
be
what
william
dean
howells
called
them
historical
fiction
for
they
form
a
record
of
the
farmer
life
as
i
lived
it
and
studied
it
in
these
two
books
is
a
record
of
the
privations
and
hardships
of
the
men
and
women
who
subdued
the
midland
wilderness
and
prepared
the
way
for
the
present
golden
age
of
agriculture
march
introduction
i
an
interesting
phase
of
fiction
at
present
is
the
material
prosperity
of
the
short
story
which
seems
to
have
followed
its
artistic
excellence
among
us
with
uncommon
obedience
to
a
law
that
ought
always
to
prevail
until
of
late
the
publisher
has
been
able
to
say
to
the
author
dazzled
and
perhaps
deceived
by
his
magazine
success
with
short
stories
and
fondly
intending
to
make
a
book
of
them
yes
but
collections
of
short
stories
do
sell
the
public
wo
have
them
i
do
know
why
but
it
wo
this
was
never
quite
true
of
the
short
stories
of
bret
harte
or
of
miss
sarah
orne
jewett
or
of
aldrich
but
it
was
too
true
of
the
short
stories
of
most
other
writers
for
some
reason
or
for
none
the
very
people
who
liked
an
author
short
stories
in
the
magazine
could
not
bear
them
or
would
not
buy
them
when
he
put
several
of
them
together
in
a
volume
they
then
became
obnoxious
or
at
least
undesirable
somewhat
as
human
beings
agreeable
enough
as
long
as
they
are
singly
domiciled
in
one
block
become
a
positive
detriment
to
the
neighborhood
when
gathered
together
in
a
a
novel
not
half
so
good
by
the
same
author
would
formerly
outsell
his
collection
of
short
stories
five
times
over
perhaps
it
would
still
outsell
the
stories
we
rather
think
it
would
but
not
in
that
proportion
the
hour
of
the
short
story
in
book
form
has
struck
apparently
for
with
all
our
love
and
veneration
for
publishers
we
have
never
regarded
them
as
martyrs
to
literature
and
we
do
not
believe
they
would
now
be
issuing
so
many
volumes
of
short
stories
if
these
did
not
pay
publishers
with
all
their
virtues
are
as
distinctly
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
as
any
class
of
mortals
we
know
they
are
in
fact
a
tentative
and
timid
kind
never
quite
happy
except
in
full
view
of
the
main
chance
and
just
at
this
moment
this
chance
seems
to
wear
the
diversified
physiognomy
of
the
collected
short
stories
we
do
not
know
how
it
has
happened
we
should
not
at
all
undertake
to
say
but
it
is
probably
attributable
to
a
number
of
causes
it
may
be
the
prodigious
popularity
of
kipling
which
has
broken
down
all
prejudices
against
the
form
of
his
success
the
vogue
that
maupassant
tales
in
the
original
or
in
versions
have
enjoyed
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
possibly
the
critical
recognition
of
the
american
supremacy
in
this
sort
has
helped
but
however
it
has
come
about
it
is
certain
that
the
result
has
come
and
the
publishers
are
fearlessly
adventuring
volumes
of
short
stories
on
every
hand
and
not
only
short
stories
by
authors
of
established
repute
but
by
new
writers
who
would
certainly
not
have
found
this
way
to
the
public
some
time
ago
the
change
by
no
means
indicates
that
the
pleasure
in
large
fiction
is
dying
out
this
remains
of
as
ample
gorge
as
ever
but
it
does
mean
that
a
quite
reasonless
reluctance
has
given
way
and
that
a
young
writer
can
now
hope
to
come
under
the
fire
of
criticism
much
sooner
than
before
this
may
not
be
altogether
a
blessing
it
has
its
penalties
inherent
in
the
defective
nature
of
criticism
or
the
critics
but
undoubtedly
it
gives
the
young
author
definition
and
fixity
in
the
reader
knowledge
it
enables
him
to
continue
a
writer
if
he
likes
or
it
prepares
the
public
not
to
be
surprised
at
him
if
he
turns
out
a
novelist
ii
these
are
advantages
and
we
must
not
be
impatient
of
any
writer
who
continues
a
writer
when
he
might
freely
become
a
novelist
now
that
a
writer
can
profitably
do
so
he
may
prefer
to
grow
his
fiction
on
the
dwarf
stock
he
may
plausibly
contend
that
this
was
the
original
stock
and
that
the
novella
was
a
short
story
many
ages
before
its
name
was
appropriated
by
the
standard
variety
the
duodecimo
american
or
the
english
that
boccaccio
was
a
celebrity
five
centuries
before
george
eliot
was
known
to
be
a
woman
to
be
sure
we
might
come
back
at
him
with
the
greek
romancers
we
might
ask
him
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
interminable
tales
of
heliodorus
and
longus
and
the
rest
and
then
not
let
him
say
but
no
such
controversy
is
necessary
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
half
dozen
volumes
of
short
stories
at
hand
and
we
gladly
postpone
it
till
we
have
nothing
to
talk
about
at
present
we
have
only
too
much
to
talk
about
in
a
book
so
robust
and
terribly
serious
as
hamlin
garland
volume
called
roads
that
is
what
they
call
the
highways
in
the
part
of
the
west
that
garland
comes
from
and
writes
about
and
these
stories
are
full
of
the
bitter
and
burning
dust
the
foul
and
trampled
slush
of
the
common
avenues
of
life
the
life
of
the
men
who
hopelessly
and
cheerlessly
make
the
wealth
that
enriches
the
alien
and
the
idler
and
impoverishes
the
producer
if
any
one
is
still
at
a
loss
to
account
for
that
uprising
of
the
farmers
in
the
west
which
is
the
translation
of
the
peasants
war
into
modern
and
republican
terms
let
him
read
roads
and
he
will
begin
to
understand
unless
indeed
garland
is
painting
the
exceptional
rather
than
the
average
the
stories
are
full
of
those
gaunt
grim
sordid
pathetic
ferocious
figures
whom
our
satirists
find
so
easy
to
caricature
as
hayseeds
and
whose
blind
groping
for
fairer
conditions
is
so
grotesque
to
the
newspapers
and
so
menacing
to
the
politicians
they
feel
that
something
is
wrong
and
they
know
that
the
wrong
is
not
theirs
the
type
caught
in
garland
book
is
not
pretty
it
is
ugly
and
often
ridiculous
but
it
is
in
its
rude
despair
the
story
of
a
farm
mortgage
as
it
is
told
in
the
powerful
sketch
under
the
lion
paw
is
a
lesson
in
political
economy
as
well
as
a
tragedy
of
the
darkest
cast
the
return
of
the
private
is
a
satire
of
the
keenest
edge
as
well
as
a
tender
and
mournful
idyl
of
the
unknown
soldier
who
comes
back
after
the
war
with
no
blare
of
welcoming
trumpets
or
flash
of
streaming
flags
but
with
no
stake
in
the
country
he
has
helped
to
make
safe
and
rich
but
the
poor
chance
to
snatch
an
uncertain
subsistence
from
the
furrows
he
left
for
the
up
the
coolly
however
is
the
story
which
most
pitilessly
of
all
accuses
our
vaunted
conditions
wherein
every
man
has
the
chance
to
rise
above
his
brother
and
make
himself
richer
than
his
fellows
it
shows
us
once
for
all
what
the
risen
man
may
be
and
portrays
in
his
selfishness
and
indifference
that
favorite
ideal
of
our
system
the
successful
brother
comes
back
to
the
old
farmstead
prosperous
handsome
and
full
of
patronizing
sentiment
for
his
boyhood
days
there
and
he
can
not
understand
why
his
brother
whom
hard
work
and
corroding
mortgages
have
eaten
all
the
joy
out
of
gives
him
a
grudging
and
surly
welcome
it
is
a
tremendous
situation
and
it
is
the
allegory
of
the
whole
world
civilization
the
upper
dog
and
the
under
dog
are
everywhere
and
the
under
dog
nowhere
likes
it
but
the
allegorical
effects
are
not
the
primary
intent
of
work
it
is
a
work
of
art
first
of
all
and
we
think
of
fine
art
though
the
material
will
strike
many
gentilities
as
coarse
and
common
in
one
of
the
stories
among
the
there
is
a
good
deal
of
burly
humor
of
a
fresh
and
native
kind
in
ripley
trip
is
a
delicate
touch
like
that
of
miss
wilkins
but
garland
touches
are
his
own
here
and
elsewhere
he
has
a
certain
harshness
and
bluntness
an
indifference
to
the
more
delicate
charms
of
style
and
he
has
still
to
learn
that
though
the
thistle
is
full
of
an
unrecognized
poetry
the
rose
has
a
poetry
too
that
even
can
not
spoil
but
he
has
a
fine
courage
to
leave
a
fact
with
the
reader
ungarnished
and
unvarnished
which
is
almost
the
rarest
trait
in
an
writer
so
infantile
and
feeble
is
the
custom
of
our
art
and
this
attains
tragical
sublimity
in
the
opening
sketch
a
branch
road
where
the
lover
who
has
quarrelled
with
his
betrothed
comes
back
to
find
her
mismated
and
miserable
such
a
farm
wife
as
garland
has
alone
dared
to

to

i
in
the
windless
september
dawn
a
voice
went
ringing
clear
and
sweet
a
man
voice
singing
a
cheap
and
common
air
yet
something
in
the
sound
of
it
told
he
was
young
jubilant
and
a
happy
lover
above
the
level
belt
of
timber
to
the
east
a
vast
dome
of
pale
undazzling
gold
was
rising
silently
and
swiftly
jays
called
in
the
thickets
where
the
maples
flamed
amid
the
green
oaks
with
irregular
splashes
of
red
and
orange
the
grass
was
crisp
with
frost
under
the
feet
the
road
smooth
and
in
color
the
air
was
indescribably
pure
resonant
and
stimulating
no
wonder
the
man
sang
he
came
into
view
around
the
curve
in
the
lane
he
had
a
fork
on
his
shoulder
a
graceful
and
polished
tool
his
straw
hat
was
tilted
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
rough
faded
coat
was
buttoned
close
to
the
chin
and
he
wore
thin
buckskin
gloves
on
his
hands
he
looked
muscular
and
intelligent
and
was
evidently
about
years
of
age
as
he
walked
on
and
the
sunrise
came
nearer
to
him
he
stopped
his
song
the
broadening
heavens
had
a
majesty
and
sweetness
that
made
him
forget
the
physical
joy
of
happy
youth
he
grew
almost
sad
with
the
vague
thoughts
and
great
emotions
which
rolled
in
his
brain
as
the
wonder
of
the
morning
grew
he
walked
more
slowly
mechanically
following
the
road
his
eyes
on
the
streaming
banners
of
rose
and
pale
green
which
made
the
east
too
glorious
for
any
words
to
tell
the
air
was
so
still
it
seemed
to
await
expectantly
the
coming
of
the
sun
then
his
mind
flew
back
to
agnes
would
she
see
it
she
was
at
work
getting
breakfast
but
he
hoped
she
had
time
to
see
it
he
was
in
that
mood
so
common
to
him
now
wherein
he
could
not
fully
enjoy
any
sight
or
sound
unless
sharing
it
with
her
far
down
the
road
he
heard
the
sharp
clatter
of
a
wagon
the
roosters
were
calling
near
and
far
in
many
keys
and
tunes
the
dogs
were
barking
were
jangling
in
the
wooded
pastures
and
as
the
youth
passed
farmhouses
lights
in
the
kitchen
windows
showed
that
the
women
were
astir
about
breakfast
and
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
tapping
of
at
the
barn
told
that
the
men
were
at
their
morning
chores
and
the
east
bloomed
broader
the
dome
of
gold
grew
brighter
the
faint
clouds
here
and
there
flamed
with
a
flush
of
red
the
frost
began
to
glisten
with
a
reflected
color
the
youth
dreamed
as
he
walked
his
broad
face
and
deep
earnest
eyes
caught
and
retained
some
part
of
the
beauty
and
majesty
of
the
sky
but
his
brow
darkened
as
he
passed
a
farm
gate
and
a
young
man
of
about
his
own
age
joined
him
the
other
man
was
equipped
for
work
like
himself
hello
will
hello
ed
going
down
to
help
dingman

replied
will
shortly
it
was
easy

dave
mcturg
yes
i
guess
so
have

to
anybody
yet
they
walked
on
side
by
side
will
hardly
felt
like
being
rudely
broken
in
on
in
this
way
the
two
men
were
rivals
but
will
being
the
victor
would
have
been
magnanimous
only
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
his
dream
when
do
you
go
back
to
the
sem
ed
asked

a
little

i
expect

if

slip
up
on
it
they
walked
on
side
by
side
both
handsome
fellows
ed
a
little
more
showy
in
his
face
which
had
a
certain
precision
of
line
and
a
peculiar
clear
pallor
that
never
browned
under
the
sun
he
chewed
vigorously
on
a
quid
of
tobacco
one
of
his
most
noticeable
bad
habits
teams
could
be
heard
clattering
along
on
several
roads
now
and
jovial
voices
singing
one
team
coming
along
rapidly
behind
the
two
men
the
driver
sung
out
in
warning
get
out
o
the
way
there
and
with
a
laugh
and
a
chirp
spurred
his
horses
to
pass
them
ed
with
a
swift
understanding
of
the
driver
trick
flung
out
his
left
hand
and
caught
the
threw
his
fork
in
and
leaped
after
it
will
walked
on
disdaining
attempt
to
catch
the
wagon
on
all
sides
now
the
wagons
of
the
ploughmen
or
threshers
were
getting
out
into
the
fields
with
a
pounding
rumbling
sound
the
sun
was
shooting
light
through
the
leaves
and
warming
the
boles
of
the
great
oaks
that
stood
in
the
yard
and
melting
the
frost
off
the
great
gaudy
red
and
gold
striped
threshing
machine
standing
between
the
stacks
the
interest
picturesqueness
of
it
all
got
hold
of
will
hannan
accustomed
to
it
as
he
was
the
horses
stood
about
in
a
circle
hitched
to
the
ends
of
the
six
sweeps
every
rod
shining
with
frost
the
driver
was
oiling
the
great
tarry
underneath
laughing
fellows
were
wrestling
about
the
yard
ed
kinney
had
scaled
the
highest
stack
and
stood
ready
to
throw
the
first
sheaf
the
sun
lighting
him
where
he
stood
made
his
gleam
like
dull
gold
cheery
words
jests
and
snatches
of
song
rose
everywhere
dingman
bustled
about
giving
his
orders
and
placing
his
men
and
the
voice
of
big
david
mcturg
was
heard
calling
to
the
men
as
they
raised
the
long
stacker
into
place
heave
ho
there
up
she
rises
and
best
of
all
will
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
smiling
at
the
kitchen
window
that
made
the
blood
beat
in
his
throat
hello
will
was
the
general
greeting
given
with
some
constraint
by
most
of
the
young
fellows
for
will
had
been
going
to
rock
river
to
school
for
some
years
and
there
was
a
little
feeling
of
jealousy
on
the
part
of
those
who
pretended
to
sneer
at
the
seminary
chaps
like
will
hannan
and
milton
jennings
dingman
came
up
will
i
guess
you
better
go
on
the
stack
with
ed
all
ready
hurrah
there
said
david
in
his
soft
but
resonant
bass
voice
that
always
had
a
laugh
in
it
come
come
every
sucker
of
yeh
git
hold
o
something
all
ready
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
driver
who
climbed
upon
his
platform
everybody
scrambled
into
place
the
driver
began
to
talk
chk
chk
all
ready
boys
stiddy
there
dan
chk
chk
all
ready
boys
stiddy
there
boys
all
ready
now
the
horses
began
to
strain
at
the
sweeps
the
cylinder
began
to
hum
grab
a
root
there
where
my
here
you
climb
on
here
and
david
reached
down
and
pulled
shep
watson
up
by
the
shoulder
with
his
gigantic
hand
yarr
yarr
the
whirling
cylinder
boomed
roared
and
snarled
as
it
rose
in
speed
at
last
when
its
tone
became
a
rattling
yell
david
nodded
to
the
pitchers
and
rasped
his
hands
together
the
sheaves
began
to
fall
from
the
stack
the
knife
in
hand
slashed
the
bands
in
twain
and
the
feeder
with
easy
majestic
movement
gathered
them
under
his
arm
rolled
them
out
into
an
even
belt
of
entering
wheat
on
which
the
cylinder
tore
with
its
smothered
ferocious
snarl
will
was
very
happy
in
a
quiet
way
he
enjoyed
the
smooth
roll
of
his
great
muscles
the
sense
of
power
in
his
hands
as
he
lifted
turned
and
swung
the
heavy
sheaves
two
by
two
upon
the
table
where
the
madly
slashed
away
his
frame
sturdy
rather
than
tall
was
nevertheless
lithe
and
he
made
a
fine
figure
to
look
at
so
agnes
thought
as
she
came
out
a
moment
and
bowed
and
smiled
this
scene
one
of
the
jolliest
and
most
sociable
of
the
western
farm
had
a
charm
quite
aside
from
human
companionship
the
beautiful
yellow
straw
entering
the
cylinder
the
clear
wheat
pulsing
out
at
the
side
the
broken
straw
chaff
and
dust
puffing
out
on
the
great
stacker
the
cheery
whistling
and
calling
of
the
driver
the
keen
crisp
air
and
the
bright
sun
somehow
weirdly
suggestive
of
the
passage
of
time
will
and
agnes
had
arrived
at
a
tacit
understanding
of
mutual
love
only
the
night
before
and
will
was
powerfully
moved
to
glance
often
toward
the
house
but
feared
as
never
before
the
jokes
of
his
companions
he
worked
on
therefore
methodically
eagerly
but
his
thoughts
were
on
the
future
the
rustle
of
the
near
by
the
noise
of
whose
sere
leaves
he
could
distinguish
sifting
beneath
the
booming
snarl
of
the
machine
was
like
the
sound
of
a
woman
dress
on
the
sky
were
great
fleets
of
clouds
sailing
on
the
rising
wind
like
merchantmen
bound
to
some
land
of
love
and
plenty
when
the
dingmans
first
came
in
only
a
couple
of
years
before
agnes
had
been
at
once
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
suitors
her
pleasant
face
and
her
abounding
made
her
an
instant
favorite
with
all
will
however
had
disdained
to
become
one
of
the
crowd
and
held
himself
aloof
as
he
could
easily
do
being
away
at
school
most
of
the
time
the
second
winter
however
agnes
also
attended
the
seminary
and
will
saw
her
daily
and
grew
to
love
her
he
had
been
just
a
bit
jealous
of
ed
kinney
all
the
time
for
ed
had
a
certain
rakish
grace
in
dancing
and
a
dashing
skill
in
handling
a
team
which
made
him
a
dangerous
rival
but
as
will
worked
beside
him
all
the
monday
he
felt
so
secure
in
his
knowledge
of
the
caress
agnes
had
given
him
at
parting
the
night
before
that
he
was
perfectly
happy
so
happy
that
he
did
care
to
talk
only
to
work
on
and
dream
as
he
worked
shrewd
david
mcturg
had
his
joke
when
the
machine
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
well
you
fellers

i
expected

shep
wilson
you
laughed
one
of
the
others
anybody

a
fit

david

said
bill
young
from
the
straw
pile
you
ai
to
have
all
the
fun
to
yerself
will
blood
began
to
grow
hot
in
his
face
if
bill
had
said
much
more
or
mentioned
agnes
by
name
he
would
have
silenced
him
to
have
this
rough
joking
come
so
close
upon
the
holiest
and
most
exquisite
evening
of
his
life
was
horrible
it
was
not
the
words
they
said
but
the
tones
they
used
that
vulgarized
it
all
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
sound
of
the
machine
began
again
this
jesting
made
him
more
wary
and
when
the
call
for
dinner
sounded
and
he
knew
he
was
going
to
see
her
he
shrank
from
it
he
took
no
part
in
the
race
of
the
men
to
get
at
the
first
he
took
no
part
in
the
scurry
to
get
seats
at
the
first
table
was
always
a
season
of
great
trial
to
the
housewife
to
have
a
dozen
men
with
the
appetites
of
dragons
to
cook
for
in
addition
to
their
other
everyday
duties
was
no
small
task
for
a
couple
of
women
preparations
usually
began
the
night
before
with
a
raid
on
a
for
biled
chickun
formed
the
pièce
de
resistance
of
the
dinner
the
table
enlarged
by
boards
filled
the
sitting
room
extra
seats
were
made
out
of
planks
placed
on
chairs
and
dishes
were
borrowed
from
neighbors
who
came
for
such
aid
in
their
turn
sometimes
the
neighboring
women
came
in
to
help
but
agnes
and
her
mother
were
determined
to
manage
the
job
alone
this
year
and
so
the
girl
in
a
neat
dark
dress
her
eyes
shining
her
cheeks
flushed
with
the
work
received
the
men
as
they
came
in
dusty
coatless
with
grime
behind
their
ears
but
a
jolly
good
smile
on
every
face
most
of
them
were
farmers
of
the
neighborhood
and
her
schoolmates
the
only
one
she
shrank
from
was
bill
young
with
his
hard
glittering
eyes
and
red
sordid
face
she
received
their
jokes
their
noise
with
a
silent
smile
which
showed
her
even
teeth
and
dimpled
her
round
cheek
she
was
good
for
sore
eyes
as
one
of
the
fellows
said
to
shep
she
seemed
deliciously
sweet
and
dainty
to
these
roughly
dressed
fellows
they
ranged
along
the
table
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
boots
thumping
squeaking
knives
and
forks
rattling
voices
bellowing
out
now

off
that
drive
it
too
old
criticised
shep
passing
the
potatoes
were
seized
cut
in
halves
sopped
in
gravy
and
taken
one
two
corn
cakes
went
into
great
jaws
like
coal
into
a
knives
in
the
right
hand
cut
meat
and
scooped
gravy
up
great
muscular
grimy
but
wholesome
fellows
they
were
feeding
like
ancient
norse
and
capable
of
working
like
demons
they
were
deep
in
the
process
by
steam
from
the
potatoes
and
stew
in
less
than
sixty
seconds
after
their
entrance
with
a
shrinking
from
the
comments
of
the
others
upon
his
regard
for
agnes
will
assumed
a
reserved
and
almost
haughty
air
toward
his
and
a
curious
coldness
toward
her
as
he
went
in
she
came
forward
smiling
brightly
there
one
more
place
will
a
tender
involuntary
droop
in
her
voice
betrayed
her
and
will
felt
a
wave
of
hot
blood
surge
over
him
as
the
rest
roared
ha
ha
oh
there
be
a
place
for
him
do
worry
will
always
room
for
you
here
will
took
his
seat
with
a
sudden
angry
flame
why
ca
she
keep
it
from
these
fools
was
his
thought
he
even
thank
her
for
showing
him
the
chair
she
flushed
vividly
but
smiled
back
she
was
so
proud
and
happy
she
did
care
very
much
if
they
did
know
it
but
as
will
looked
at
her
with
that
quick
angry
glance
she
was
hurt
and
puzzled
she
redoubled
her
exertions
to
please
him
and
by
so
doing
added
to
the
amusement
of
the
crowd
that
gnawed
rattled
cups
knives
and
forks
and
joked
as
they
ate
with
small
grace
and
no
material
loss
of
time
will
remained
silent
through
it
all
eating
his
potato
in
marked
contrast
to
the
others
with
his
fork
instead
of
his
knife
and
drinking
his
tea
from
his
cup
rather
than
from
his
saucer
finnickies
which
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
girl
nor
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
other
workmen
see
that
that
the
way
we
do
down
to
the
sem
see
fork
for

over
to
say

nudged
each
other
and
grinned
aha
what
did
i
tell
you
agnes

at
last
that
for
some
reason
will
did
want
her
to
show
her
regard
for
him
that
he
was
ashamed
of
it
in
some
way
and
she
was
wounded
to
cover
it
up
she
resorted
to
the
natural
device
of
smiling
and
chatting
with
the
others
she
asked
ed
if
he
would
have
another
piece
of
pie
i
will
with
a
fork
please
this
is
the
only
place
you
can
use
a
fork
said
bill
young
anticipating
a
laugh
by
his
own
broad
grin
oh
that
too
old
said
shep
watson
do
drag
that
out
agin
a
man
that

seven
taters
shows
who
does
the
work
yes
with
his
jaws
put
in
jim
wheelock
the
driver
if
you
put
in
a
little
more
work
with
soap
water
before
comin
in
to
dinner
it
be
a
religious
idee
said
david
it
ai
healthy
to
well
you
live
forever
then
he
ai
washed
his
face
sence
i
knew
oh
that
a
little
too
tough
he
washes
once
a
week
said
ed
kinney
back
of
his
ears
inquired
david
who
was
munching
a
doughnut
his
black
eyes
twinkling
with
fun
yep
what
the
cause
of
it
dade
says
she
wo
kiss
if
he
do
everybody
roared
good
fer
dade
i
would
if
i
was
in
her
place
wheelock
gripped
a
imperturbably
and
left
it
bare
as
a
toothpick
with
one
or
two
bites
at
it
his
face
shone
in
two
clean
sections
around
his
nose
and
mouth
behind
his
ears
the
dirt
lay
undisturbed
the
grease
on
his
hands
could
not
be
washed
off
will
began
to
suffer
now
because
agnes
treated
the
other
fellows
too
well
with
a
lover
exacting
jealousy
he
wanted
her
in
some
way
to
hide
their
tenderness
from
the
rest
but
to
show
her
indifference
to
men
like
young
and
kinney
he
did
stop
to
inquire
of
himself
the
justice
of
such
a
demand
nor
just
how
it
was
to
be
done
he
only
insisted
she
ought
to
do
it
he
rose
and
left
the
table
at
the
end
of
his
dinner
without
having
spoken
to
her
without
even
a
tender
significant
glance
and
he
knew
too
that
she
was
troubled
and
hurt
but
he
was
suffering
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
lost
something
sweet
lost
it
irrecoverably
he
noticed
ed
kinney
and
bill
young
were
the
last
to
come
out
just
before
the
machine
started
up
again
after
dinner
and
he
saw
them
pause
outside
the
threshold
and
laugh
back
at
agnes
standing
in
the
doorway
why
could
she
keep
those
fellows
at
a
distance
not
go
out
of
her
way
to
bandy
jokes
with
them
in
some
way
the
elation
of
the
morning
was
gone
he
worked
on
doggedly
now
without
looking
up
without
listening
to
the
leaves
without
seeing
the
sunlighted
clouds
of
course
he
did
think
that
she
meant
anything
by
it
but
it
irritated
him
and
made
him
unhappy
she
gave
herself
too
freely
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
machine
stopped
for
some
repairing
and
while
will
lay
on
his
stack
in
the
bright
yellow
sunshine
shelling
wheat
in
his
hands
and
listening
to
the
wind
in
the
oaks
he
heard
his
name
and
her
name
mentioned
on
the
other
side
of
the
machine
where
the
stood
he
listened
she
pretty
sweet
on
him
ai
she
did
yeh
notus
how
she
stood
around
over
him
yes
an
did
yeh
see
him
when
she
passed
the
cup
o
tea
down
over
his
shoulder
will
got
up
white
with
wrath
as
they
laughed
someway
he
did
seem
to
enjoy
it
as
i
would
i
wish
she
reach
her
arm
over
my
neck
that
way
will
walked
around
the
machine
and
came
on
the
group
lying
on
the
chaff
near
the
say
i
want
you
fellers
to
understand
that
i
wo
have
any
more
of
this
talk
i
wo
have
it
there
was
a
dead
silence
then
bill
young
got
up
what
yeh
goin
to
do
about
ut
he
sneered
i
going
to
stop
it
the
wolf
rose
in
young
he
moved
forward
his
ferocious
soul
flaming
from
his
eyes
you
damned
seminary
dude
i
can
break
you
in
two
an
answering
glare
came
into
will
eyes
he
grasped
and
slightly
shook
his
fork
which
he
had
brought
with
him
unconsciously
if
you
make
one
motion
at
me
i
smash
your
head
like
an
his
voice
was
low
but
terrific
there
was
a
tone
in
it
that
made
his
own
blood
stop
in
his
veins
if
you
think
i
going
to
roll
around
on
this
ground
with
a
hyena
like
you
you
mistaken
your
man
i
kill
you
but
i
wo
fight
with
such
men
as
you
are
bill
quailed
and
slunk
away
muttering
some
epithet
like
coward
i
do
care
what
you
call
me
but
just
remember
what
i
say
you
keep
your
tongue
off
that
girl
affairs
that
the
talk
said
david
stand
up
for
your
girl
always
but
use
a
fork
you
can
handle
him
without
that
i
do
propose
to
try
said
will
as
he
turned
away
as
he
did
so
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
ed
kinney
at
the
well
pumping
a
pail
of
water
for
agnes
who
stood
beside
him
the
sun
on
her
beautiful
yellow
hair
she
was
laughing
at
something
ed
was
saying
as
he
slowly
moved
the
handle
up
and
down
instantly
like
a
foaming
turbid
flood
his
rage
swept
out
toward
her
it
all
her
fault
he
thought
grinding
his
teeth
she
a
fool
if
she
hold
herself
in
like
other
girls
but
no
she
must
smile
and
smile
at
everybody
it
was
a
beautiful
picture
but
it
sent
a
shiver
through
him
he
worked
on
with
teeth
set
white
with
rage
he
had
an
impulse
that
would
have
made
him
assault
her
with
words
as
with
a
knife
he
was
possessed
of
a
terrible
passion
which
was
hitherto
latent
in
him
and
which
he
now
felt
to
be
his
worst
self
but
he
was
powerless
to
exorcise
it
his
set
teeth
ached
with
the
stress
of
his
muscular
tension
and
his
eyes
smarted
with
the
strain
he
had
always
prided
himself
on
being
cool
calm
above
these
absurd
quarrels
which
his
companions
had
indulged
in
he
did
suppose
he
could
be
so
moved
as
he
worked
on
his
rage
settled
into
a
sort
of
stubborn
bitterness
stubborn
bitterness
of
conflict
between
this
evil
nature
and
his
usual
self
it
was
the
instinct
of
possession
the
organic
feeling
of
proprietorship
of
a
woman
which
rose
to
the
surface
and
mastered
him
he
was
not
a
of
course
being
young
though
he
was
more
introspective
than
the
ordinary
farmer
he
had
a
great
deal
of
time
to
think
it
over
as
he
worked
on
there
pitching
the
heavy
bundles
but
still
he
did
not
get
rid
of
the
miserable
desire
to
punish
agnes
and
when
she
came
out
looking
very
pretty
in
her
straw
hat
and
came
around
near
his
stack
he
knew
she
came
to
see
him
to
have
an
explanation
a
smile
and
yet
he
worked
away
with
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
hardly
noticing
her
ed
went
over
to
the
edge
of
the
stack
and
chatted
with
her
and
she
poor
girl
feeling
will
neglect
could
only
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
show
that
she
did
mind
it
by
laughing
back
at
ed
all
this
will
saw
though
he
did
appear
to
be
looking
and
when
jim
wheelock
dirty
jim
with
his
whip
in
his
hand
came
up
and
playfully
pretended
to
pour
oil
on
her
hair
and
she
laughingly
struck
at
him
with
a
handful
of
straw
will
would
have
looked
at
her
if
she
had
called
him
by
name
she
looked
so
bright
and
charming
in
her
snowy
apron
and
her
boy
straw
hat
tipped
jauntily
over
one
pink
ear
that
david
and
steve
and
bill
and
even
shep
found
a
way
to
get
a
word
with
her
and
the
poor
fellows
in
the
high
looked
their
disappointment
and
shook
their
forks
in
mock
rage
at
the
lucky
dogs
on
the
ground
but
will
worked
on
like
a
fiend
while
the
dapples
of
light
and
shade
fell
on
the
bright
face
of
the
merry
girl
to
save
his
soul
from
he
could
have
gone
over
there
and
smiled
at
her
it
was
impossible
a
wall
of
bronze
seemed
to
have
arisen
between
them
yesterday
last
night
seemed
a
dream
the
clasp
of
her
hands
at
his
neck
the
touch
of
her
lips
were
like
the
caresses
of
an
ideal
in
some
revery
long
ago
as
night
drew
on
the
men
worked
with
a
steadier
more
mechanical
action
no
one
spoke
now
each
man
was
intent
on
his
work
no
one
had
any
strength
or
breath
to
waste
the
driver
on
his
power
changed
his
weight
on
weary
feet
and
whistled
and
sang
at
the
tired
horses
the
feeder
his
face
gray
with
dust
rolled
the
grain
into
the
cylinder
so
evenly
so
steady
so
swiftly
that
it
ran
on
with
a
sullen
booming
roar
far
up
on
the
the
stackers
worked
with
the
steady
rhythmic
action
of
men
rowing
a
boat
their
figures
looming
vague
and
dim
in
the
flying
dust
and
chaff
outlined
against
the
glorious
yellow
and
clouds
whistled
the
driver
with
the
sweet
cheery
rising
notes
of
a
bird
chk

chk
chk

in
the
house
the
women
were
setting
the
table
for
supper
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
the
oaks
flinging
glorious
and
orange
shadows
along
the
edges
of
the
clouds
agnes
stopped
her
work
at
the
kitchen
window
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
cry
silently
what
was
the
matter
with
will
she
felt
a
sort
of
distrust
of
him
now
she
thought
she
knew
him
so
well
but
now
he
was
so
strange
come
aggie
said
dingman
they
gettin

to
the
bottom

doll
boys
chk

chk
called
the
driver
out
in
the
dusk
cheerily
swinging
the
whip
over
the
horses
backs
roared
the
machine
with
a
muffled
monotonous
solemn
tone
boys
will
had
worked
unceasingly
all
day
his
muscles
ached
with
fatigue
his
hands
trembled
he
clenched
his
teeth
however
and
worked
on
determined
not
to
yield
he
wanted
them
to
understand
that
he
could
do
as
much
pitching
as
any
of
them
and
read
cæsar
commentaries
beside
it
seemed
as
if
each
bundle
were
the
last
he
could
raise
the
sinews
of
his
wrist
pained
him
so
they
seemed
swollen
to
twice
their
natural
size
but
still
he
worked
on
grimly
while
the
dusk
fell
and
the
air
grew
chill
at
last
the
bottom
bundle
was
pitched
up
and
he
got
down
on
his
knees
to
help
scrape
the
loose
wheat
into
baskets
what
a
sweet
relief
it
was
to
kneel
down
to
release
the
fork
and
let
the
worn
and
cramping
muscles
settle
into
rest
a
new
note
came
into
the
driver
voice
a
soothing
tone
full
of
kindness
and
admiration
for
the
work
his
teams
had
done
lads
boys
there
dan
stiddy
stiddy
old
man
ho
there
the
cylinder
took
on
a
lower
key
with
short
rising
yells
as
it
ran
empty
for
a
moment
the
horses
had
been
going
so
long
that
they
came
to
a
stop
reluctantly
at
last
david
called
turn
out
the
men
seized
the
ends
of
the
sweep
david
uncoupled
the
and
shep
slowly
shoved
a
sheaf
of
grain
into
the
cylinder
choking
it
into
silence
the
stillness
and
the
dusk
were
very
impressive
so
long
had
the
sung
its
deafening
song
into
will
ear
that
as
he
walked
away
into
the
dusk
will
had
a
weird
feeling
of
being
suddenly
deaf
and
his
legs
were
so
numb
that
he
could
hardly
feel
the
earth
he
stumbled
away
like
a
man
paralyzed
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
wiped
the
dust
from
his
face
as
best
he
could
shook
his
coat
dusted
his
shoulders
with
a
and
was
starting
away
when
dingman
a
rather
feeble
elderly
man
came
up
come
will
supper
all
ready
go
in
and
eat
i
guess
i
go
home
to
supper
oh
no
that
wo
do
the
women
be
expecting
you
to
stay
the
men
were
laughing
at
the
well
the
warm
yellow
light
shone
from
the
kitchen
the
chill
air
making
it
seem
very
inviting
and
she
was
there
waiting
but
the
demon
rose
in
him
he
knew
agnes
would
expect
him
that
she
would
cry
that
night
with
disappointment
but
his
face
hardened
i
guess
i
go
home
he
said
and
his
tone
was
relentless
he
turned
and
walked
away
hungry
tired
so
tired
he
stumbled
and
so
unhappy
he
could
have
wept
ii
on
thursday
the
county
fair
was
to
be
held
the
fair
is
one
of
the
of
the
year
in
the
country
districts
of
the
west
and
one
of
the
times
when
the
country
lover
rises
above
expense
to
the
extravagance
of
hiring
a
in
which
to
take
his
sweetheart
to
the
neighboring
town
it
was
customary
to
prepare
for
this
long
beforehand
for
the
demand
for
was
so
great
the
grew
dictatorial
and
took
no
chances
slowly
but
surely
the
country
beaux
began
to
compete
with
the
clerks
and
in
many
cases
actually
outbid
them
as
they
furnished
their
own
horses
and
could
bid
higher
in
consequence
on
the
carriages
will
had
secured
his
brother
rig
and
early
on
thursday
morning
he
was
at
work
busily
washing
the
mud
from
the
carriage
dusting
the
cushions
and
polishing
up
the
buckles
and
rosettes
on
his
harnesses
it
was
a
beautiful
crisp
clear
dawn
the
ideal
day
for
a
ride
and
will
was
singing
as
he
worked
he
had
regained
his
real
self
and
having
passed
through
a
bitter
period
of
shame
was
now
joyous
with
anticipation
of
forgiveness
he
looked
forward
to
the
day
with
its
chances
of
doing
a
thousand
little
things
to
show
his
regret
and
his
love
he
had
not
seen
agnes
since
monday
tuesday
he
did
not
go
back
to
help
thresh
and
wednesday
he
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
to
see
about
board
for
the
coming
term
but
he
felt
sure
of
her
it
had
all
been
arranged
the
sunday
before
she
expect
him
and
he
was
to
call
at
eight
he
polished
up
the
colts
with
merry
of
the
brush
and
comb
and
after
the
last
stroke
on
their
shining
limbs
threw
his
tools
in
the
box
and
went
to
the
house
pretty
sharp
last
night
said
his
brother
john
who
was
scrubbing
his
face
at
the
cistern

say
so
by
that
rim
of
ice
will
replied
dipping
his
hands
into
the
icy
water
i
ought

home
and

continued
the
older
man
thoughtfully
as
they
went
into
the
woodshed
and
wiped
consecutively
on
the
long

o
them

children

little
hearts

he
ended
as
the
door
opened
and
two
sturdy
little
boys
rushed
out
poppa
all
yeady
the
kitchen
table
was
set
near
the
stove
the
window
let
in
the
sun
and
the
smell
of
sizzling
sausages
and
the
aroma
of
coffee
filled
the
room
the
kettle
was
doing
its
duty
cheerily
and
the
wife
with
flushed
face
and
smiling
eyes
was
hurrying
to
and
fro
her
heart
full
of
anticipation
of
the
day
outing
there
was
a
hilarity
almost
like
some
strange
intoxication
on
the
part
of
the
two
children
they
danced
and
chattered
and
clapped
their
chubby
brown
hands
and
ran
to
the
windows

to
see
the
pathos
the
pitiful
significance
of
his
great
joy
over
a
day
outing
and
he
took
himself
a
little
to
task
at
his
own
selfish
freedom
he
resolved
to
stay
at
home
some
time
and
let
nettie
go
in
his
place
a
few
hours
in
the
middle
of
the
day
on
sunday
three
or
four
holidays
in
summer
the
rest
of
the
year
for
this
cheerful
little
wife
and
her
patient
husband
was
made
up
of
work
work
which
accomplished
little
and
brought
them
almost
nothing
that
was
beautiful
while
they
were
eating
breakfast
teams
began
to
clatter
by
huge
with
three
seats
across
and
a
boy
or
two
jouncing
up
and
down
with
the
dinner
baskets
near
the
the
children
rushed
to
the
window
each
time
to
announce
who
it
was
and
how
many
there
were
in
but
as
johnny
said
firteen
each
time
and
ned
wavered
between
seven
and
sixteen
it
was
doubtful
if
they
could
be
relied
upon
they
had
very
little
appetite
so
keen
was
their
anticipation
of
the
ride
and
the
wonderful
sights
before
them
their
little
hearts
shuddered
with
joy
at
every
fresh
token
of
preparation
a
joy
that
made
will
say
poor
little
men
they
vibrated
between
the
house
and
the
barn
while
the
chores
were
being
finished
and
their
happy
cries
started
the
young
roosters
into
a
renewed
season
of
crowing
and
when
at
last
the
wagon
was
brought
out
and
the
horses
hitched
to
it
they
danced
like
mad
sprites
after
they
had
driven
away
will
brought
out
the
colts
hitched
them
in
and
drove
them
to
the
then
he
leisurely
dressed
himself
in
his
best
suit
blacked
his
boots
with
considerable
exertion
and
at
about
climbed
into
his
carriage
and
gathered
up
the
reins
he
was
quite
happy
again
the
crisp
bracing
air
the
strong
pull
of
the
spirited
young
team
put
all
thought
of
sorrow
behind
him
he
had
planned
it
all
out
he
would
first
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kiss
her
there
would
not
need
to
be
any
words
to
tell
her
how
sorry
and
ashamed
he
was
she
would
know
now
when
he
was
alone
and
going
toward
her
on
a
beautiful
morning
the
anger
and
bitterness
of
monday
fled
away
became
unreal
and
the
sweet
dream
of
the
sunday
parting
grew
the
reality
she
was
waiting
for
him
now
she
had
on
her
pretty
blue
dress
and
the
wide
hat
that
always
made
her
look
so
arch
he
had
said
about
eight
the
swift
team
was
carrying
him
along
the
which
was
little
travelled
and
he
was
alone
with
his
thoughts
he
fell
again
upon
his
plans
another
year
at
school
for
them
both
and
then
he
go
into
a
law
office
judge
brown
had
told
him
he
give
him
whoa
ho
there
was
a
swift
lurch
that
sent
him
flying
over
the
dasher
a
confused
vision
of
a
roadside
ditch
full
of
weeds
and
bushes
and
then
he
felt
the
reins
in
his
hands
and
heard
the
snorting
horses
trample
on
the
hard
road
he
rose
dizzy
bruised
and
covered
with
dust
the
team
he
held
securely
and
soon
quieted
the
cause
of
the
accident
was
plain
the
right
had
come
off
letting
the
front
of
the
buggy
drop
he
unhitched
the
excited
team
from
the
carriage
drove
them
to
the
fence
and
tied
them
securely
then
went
back
to
find
the
wheel
and
the
burr
whose
failure
to
hold
its
place
had
done
all
the
mischief
he
soon
had
the
wheel
on
but
to
find
the
burr
was
a
harder
task
back
and
forth
he
ranged
looking
scraping
in
the
dust
searching
the
weeds
he
knew
that
sometimes
a
wheel
will
run
without
the
burr
for
many
rods
before
coming
off
and
so
each
time
he
extended
his
search
he
traversed
the
entire
half
mile
several
times
each
time
his
rage
and
disappointment
getting
more
bitter
he
ground
his
teeth
in
a
fever
of
vexation
and
dismay
he
had
a
vision
of
agnes
waiting
wondering
why
he
did
not
come
it
was
this
vision
that
kept
him
from
seeing
the
burr
in
the
partly
covered
by
a
clod
once
he
passed
it
looking
wildly
at
his
watch
which
was
showing
nine
another
time
he
passed
it
with
eyes
dimmed
with
a
mist
that
was
almost
tears
of
anger
there
is
no
contrivance
that
will
replace
an
and
have
no
unused
and
so
will
searched
each
moment
he
said
i
give
it
up
get
onto
one
of
the
horses
and
go
down
and
tell
her
but
searching
for
a
lost
is
like
fishing
the
searcher
expects
each
moment
to
find
it
and
so
he
groped
and
ran
breathlessly
furiously
back
and
forth
and
at
last
kicked
away
the
clod
that
covered
it
and
hurried
hot
and
dusty
cursing
his
stupidity
back
to
the
team
it
was
ten
as
he
climbed
again
into
the
buggy
and
started
his
team
on
a
swift
trot
down
the
road
what
would
she
think
he
saw
her
now
with
tearful
eyes
and
pouting
lips
she
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
hat
and
gloves
on
the
rest
had
gone
and
she
was
waiting
for
him
but
she
know
something
had
happened
because
he
had
promised
to
be
there
at
eight
he
had
told
her
what
team
he
have
he
had
forgotten
at
this
moment
the
doubt
and
distrust
he
had
given
her
on
monday
know
he
surely
come
but
there
was
no
smiling
or
tearful
face
watching
at
the
window
as
he
came
down
the
lane
at
a
tearing
pace
and
turned
into
the
yard
the
house
was
silent
and
the
curtains
down
the
silence
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
something
rose
up
in
his
throat
to
choke
him
agnes
he
called
hello
i
here
at
last
there
was
no
reply
as
he
sat
there
the
part
he
had
played
on
monday
came
back
to
him
she
may
be
sick
he
thought
with
a
cold
thrill
of
fear
an
old
man
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
with
a
potato
fork
in
his
hands
his
teeth
displayed
in
a
grin
she
ai
here
she
gone
gone
yes
an
hour
ago
who
she
go
with
ed
kinney
said
the
old
fellow
with
a
malicious
grin
i
guess
your
goose
is
cooked
will
lashed
the
horses
into
a
run
and
swung
round
the
yard
and
out
of
the
gate
his
face
was
white
as
a
dead
man
and
his
teeth
were
set
like
a
vice
he
glared
straight
ahead
the
team
ran
wildly
steadily
homeward
while
their
driver
guided
them
unconsciously
without
seeing
them
his
mind
was
filled
with
a
tempest
of
rages
despairs
and
shames
that
ride
he
will
never
forget
in
it
he
threw
away
all
his
plans
he
gave
up
his
year
schooling
he
gave
up
his
law
aspirations
he
deserted
his
brother
and
his
friends
in
the
dizzying
whirl
of
passions
he
had
only
one
clear
idea
to
get
away
to
go
west
to
escape
from
the
sneers
and
laughter
of
his
neighbors
and
to
make
her
suffer
by
it
all
he
drove
into
the
yard
did
not
stop
to
unharness
the
team
but
rushed
into
the
house
and
began
packing
his
trunk
his
plan
was
formed
he
would
drive
to
cedarville
and
hire
some
one
to
bring
the
team
back
he
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
the
shame
the
insult
she
had
put
upon
him
her
action
on
monday
took
on
the
same
levity
it
wore
then
and
excited
him
in
the
same
way
he
saw
her
laughing
with
ed
over
his
dismay
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
her
at
last
a
letter
that
came
from
the
ferocity
of
the
mediæval
savage
in
him
it
you
want
to
go
to
hell
with
ed
kinney
you
can
i
wo
say
a
word
that
where
he
take
you
you
wo
see
me
again
this
he
signed
and
sealed
and
then
he
bowed
his
head
and
wept
like
a
girl
but
his
tears
did
not
soften
the
effect
of
the
letter
it
went
as
straight
to
its
mark
as
he
meant
it
should
it
tore
a
seared
and
ragged
path
to
an
innocent
happy
heart
and
he
took
a
savage
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
it
as
he
rode
away
in
the
cars
toward
the
south
iii
the
seven
years
lying
between
and
made
a
great
change
in
rock
river
and
in
the
adjacent
farming
land
signs
changed
and
firms
went
out
of
business
with
characteristic
western
ease
of
shift
the
trees
grew
rapidly
dwarfing
the
houses
beneath
them
and
contrasts
of
newness
and
decay
thickened
will
found
the
country
changed
as
he
walked
along
the
dusty
road
from
rock
river
toward
the
corners
the
landscape
was
at
its
fairest
and
liberalest
with
its
seas
of
corn
and
moving
with
a
mournful
rustle
in
sharp
contrast
to
its
flashing
blades
its
gleaming
fields
of
barley
and
its
wheat
already
mottled
with
soft
gold
in
the
midst
of
its
the
changes
were
in
the
hedges
grown
higher
in
the
greater
predominance
of
cornfields
and
cattle
pastures
and
especially
in
the
destruction
of
homes
as
he
passed
on
will
saw
the
grass
growing
and
cattle
feeding
on
a
dozen
places
where
homes
had
once
stood
they
had
given
place
to
the
large
farm
and
the
still
the
whole
scene
was
bountiful
and
beautiful
to
the
eye
it
was
especially
grateful
to
will
for
he
had
spent
nearly
all
his
years
of
absence
among
the
rocks
treeless
swells
and
bleak
cliffs
of
the
southwest
the
crickets
rising
before
his
dusty
feet
appeared
to
him
something
sweet
and
suggestive
and
the
cattle
feeding
in
the
clover
moved
him
to
deep
thought
they
were
so
peaceful
and
slow
motioned
as
he
reached
a
little
popple
tree
by
the
roadside
he
stopped
removed
his
hat
put
his
elbows
on
the
fence
and
looked
hungrily
upon
the
scene
the
sky
was
deeply
blue
with
only
here
and
there
a
huge
heavy
massive
sharply
outlined
cloud
sailing
like
a
berg
of
ice
in
a
shoreless
sea
of
azure
in
the
fields
the
men
were
harvesting
the
ripened
oats
and
barley
and
the
sound
of
their
machines
clattering
now
low
now
loud
came
to
his
ears
flies
buzzed
near
him
and
a
kingbird
clattered
overhead
he
noticed
again
as
he
had
many
a
time
when
a
boy
that
the
softened
sound
of
the
reaper
was
at
times
exactly
like
the
hum
of
a
bluebottle
fly
buzzing
heedlessly
about
his
ears
a
slender
and
very
handsome
young
man
was
shocking
grain
near
the
fence
working
so
desperately
he
did
not
see
will
until
greeted
by
him
he
looked
up
replied
to
the
greeting
but
kept
on
until
he
had
finished
his
last
stook
then
he
came
to
the
shade
of
the
tree
and
took
off
his
hat
nice
day
to
sit
under
a
tree
and
fish
will
smiled
i
ought
to
know
you
i
suppose
i
used
to
live
here
years
ago
guess
not
we
came
in
three
years
ago
the
young
man
was
and
pleasant
to
look
at
will
felt
freer
with
him
are
the
kinneys
still
living
over
there
he
nodded
at
a
group
of
large
buildings
tom
lives
there
old
man
lives
with
ed
tom
ousted
the
old
man
some
way
nobody
seems
to
know
how
and
so
he
lives
with
ed
will
wanted
to
ask
after
agnes
but
hardly
felt
able
i
john
hannan
is
on
his
old
farm
yes
got
a
good
crop
this
year
will
looked
again
at
the
fields
of
rustling
wheat
over
which
the
clouds
rippled
and
said
with
an
air
of
conviction
this
lays
over
arizony
dead
sure
you
from
arizony
then
yes
a
good
ways
from
it
will
replied
in
a
way
that
stopped
further
question
good
luck
he
added
as
he
walked
on
down
the
road
toward
the
creek
musing
and
the
spring
i
wonder
if
that
there
yet
i
like
a
drink
the
sun
seemed
hotter
than
at
noon
and
he
walked
slowly
at
the
bridge
that
spanned
the
meadow
brook
just
where
it
widened
over
a
sandy
ford
he
paused
again
he
hung
over
the
rail
and
looked
at
the
minnows
swimming
there
i
wonder
if
they
the
same
identical
chaps
that
used
to
boil
and
glitter
there
when
i
was
a
boy
looks
so
men
change
from
one
generation
to
another
but
the
fish
remain
the
same
the
same
eternal
procession
of
types
i
suppose
darwin
say
their
environment
remains
the
same
he
hung
for
a
long
time
over
the
railing
thinking
of
a
vast
number
of
things
mostly
vague
flitting
things
looking
into
the
clear
depths
of
the
brook
and
listening
to
the
delicious
liquid
note
of
a
blackbird
swinging
on
the
willow
red
lilies
starred
the
grass
with
fire
and
and
chicory
grew
everywhere
purple
and
orange
and
the
prevailing
tints
suddenly
a
wriggled
across
the
dark
pool
above
the
ford
and
the
minnows
disappeared
under
the
shadow
of
the
bridge
then
will
sighed
lifted
his
head
and
walked
on
there
seemed
to
be
something
prophetic
in
it
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
that
the
way
his
plans
broke
and
faded
away
human
life
does
not
move
with
the
regularity
of
a
clock
in
living
there
are
gaps
and
silences
when
the
soul
stands
still
in
its
flight
through
abysses
and
there
come
times
of
trial
and
times
of
struggle
when
we
grow
old
without
knowing
it
body
and
soul
change
appallingly
seven
years
of
hard
busy
life
had
made
changes
in
will
his
face
had
grown
bold
resolute
and
rugged
some
of
its
delicacy
and
all
of
its
boyish
quality
was
gone
his
figure
was
stouter
erect
as
of
old
but
less
graceful
he
bore
himself
like
a
man
accustomed
to
look
out
for
himself
in
all
kinds
of
places
it
was
only
at
times
that
there
came
into
his
deep
eyes
a
preoccupied
almost
sad
look
which
showed
kinship
with
his
old
self
this
look
was
on
his
face
as
he
walked
toward
the
clump
of
trees
on
the
right
of
the
road
he
reached
the
grove
of
popple
trees
and
made
his
way
at
once
to
the
spring
when
he
saw
it
he
was
again
shocked
they
had
allowed
it
to
fill
with
leaves
and
dirt
overcome
by
the
memories
of
the
past
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
cool
and
shadowy
bank
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
reveries
of
a
man
returning
to
his
boyhood
home
he
was
filled
somehow
with
a
strange
and
powerful
feeling
of
the
passage
of
time
with
a
vague
feeling
of
the
mystery
and
elusiveness
of
human
life
the
leaves
whispered
it
overhead
the
birds
sang
it
in
chorus
with
the
insects
and
far
above
in
the
measureless
spaces
of
sky
the
hawk
told
it
in
the
silence
and
majesty
of
his
flight
from
cloud
to
cloud
it
was
a
feeling
hardly
to
be
expressed
in
words
one
of
those
emotions
whose
springs
lie
far
back
in
the
brain
he
lay
so
still
the
chipmunks
came
curiously
up
to
his
very
feet
only
to
scurry
away
when
he
stirred
like
a
sleeper
in
pain
he
had
cut
himself
off
entirely
from
the
life
at
the
corners
he
had
sent
money
home
to
john
but
had
concealed
his
own
address
carefully
the
enormity
of
his
folly
now
came
back
to
him
racking
him
till
he
groaned
he
heard
the
patter
of
feet
and
the
monologue
of
a
running
child
he
roused
up
and
faced
a
small
boy
who
started
back
in
terror
like
a
wild
fawn
he
was
deeply
surprised
to
find
a
man
there
where
only
boys
and
squirrels
now
came
he
stuck
his
fist
in
his
eye
and
was
backing
away
when
will
spoke
hold
on
sonny
nobody
hit
you
come
i
ai
goin
to
eat
yeh
he
took
a
bit
of
money
from
his
pocket
come
here
and
tell
me
your
name
i
want
to
talk
with
you
the
boy
crept
upon
the
dime
will
smiled
you
ought
to
be
a
kinney
what

he
wrote
a
little
note
and
folded
it
now
dust
out
o
here
the
boy
slipped
away
through
the
trees
like
a
rabbit
his
little
brown
feet
hardly
rustled
he
was
like
some
little
left
alone
the
man
fell
back
into
a
revery
which
lasted
till
the
shadows
fell
on
the
thick
little
grove
around
the
spring
he
rose
at
last
and
taking
his
stick
in
hand
walked
out
to
the
wood
again
and
stood
there
gazing
at
the
sky
he
seemed
loath
to
go
farther
the
sky
was
full
of
clouds
floating
in
a
sea
where
bars
of
faint
pink
streamed
broadly
away
as
he
stood
there
feeling
the
wind
lift
his
hair
listening
to
the
crickets
crying
and
facing
the
majesty
of
space
a
strange
sadness
and
despair
came
into
his
eyes
drawing
a
quick
breath
he
leaped
the
fence
and
was
about
going
on
up
the
road
when
he
heard
at
a
little
distance
the
sound
of
a
drove
of
cattle
approaching
and
he
stood
aside
to
allow
them
to
pass
they
snuffed
and
shied
at
the
silent
figure
by
the
fence
and
hurried
by
with
snapping
heels
a
peculiar
sound
that
made
will
smile
with
pleasure
an
old
man
was
driving
the
cows
crying
out
st
boy
there

on
there
whay

that
wiry
old
man

entering
his
second
childhood
and

of
hard
clods
which
he
threw
impatiently
at
the
lumbering
animals

stories

along
after
those
cows
or
i
tickle
your
old
legs
for

the
old
man
appalled
and
dazed
at
this
sudden
change
of
manner
backed
away
and
at
last
turned
and
racked
off
up
the
road
looking
back
with
a
wild
face
at
which
the
young
man
laughed
remorselessly
the
doggoned
old
skeesucks
will
soliloquized
as
he
walked
up
the
road
so
that
the
kind
of
a
character
he
been
givin
me
hullo
a
whippoorwill
takes
a
man
back
into
childhood
no
do
poor
will
he
got
all
he
can
bear
now
he
came
at
last
to
the
little
farm
dingman
had
owned
and
he
stopped
in
sorrowful
surprise
the
barn
had
been
moved
away
the
garden
ploughed
up
and
the
house
turned
into
a
granary
stood
with
boards
nailed
across
its
dusty
cobwebbed
windows
the
tears
started
into
the
eyes
he
stood
staring
at
it
silently
in
the
face
of
this
house
the
seven
years
that
he
had
last
lived
stretched
away
into
a
wild
waste
of
time
it
stood
as
a
symbol
of
his
wasted
ruined
life
it
was
personal
intimately
personal
this
decay
of
her
home
all
that
last
scene
came
back
to
him
the
booming
roar
of
the
the
cheery
whistle
of
the
driver
the
loud
merry
shouts
of
the
men
he
remembered
how
warmly
the
streamed
out
of
that
door
as
he
turned
away
tired
hungry
sullen
with
rage
and
jealousy
oh
if
he
had
only
had
the
courage
of
a
man
then
he
thought
of
the
boy
words
she
was
sick
ed
abused
her
she
had
met
her
punishment
a
hundred
times
he
had
been
over
the
whole
scene
a
thousand
times
he
had
seen
her
at
the
pump
smiling
at
ed
kinney
the
sun
lighting
her
hair
and
he
never
thought
of
that
without
hardening
at
this
very
gate
he
had
driven
up
that
last
forenoon
to
find
that
she
had
gone
with
ed
he
had
lived
that
sickening
depressing
moment
over
many
times
but
not
times
enough
to
keep
down
the
bitter
passion
he
had
felt
then
and
felt
now
as
he
went
over
it
in
detail
he
was
so
happy
and
confident
that
morning
so
perfectly
certain
that
all
would
be
made
right
by
a
kiss
and
a
cheery
jest
and
now
here
he
stood
sick
with
despair
and
doubt
of
all
the
world
he
turned
away
from
the
desolate
homestead
and
walked
on
but
i
see
her
just
once
more
and
then
and
again
the
mighty
significance
responsibility
of
life
fell
upon
him
he
felt
as
young
people
seldom
do
the
irrevocableness
of
living
the
determinate
unalterable
character
of
living
he
determined
to
begin
to
live
in
some
new
way
just
how
he
could
not
say
iv
old
man
kinney
and
his
wife
were
getting
their
lessons
with
much
bickering
when
will
drove
up
the
next
day
to
the
dilapidated
gate
and
hitched
his
team
to
a
under
the
oaks
will
saw
the
old
man
head
at
the
open
window
but
no
one
else
though
he
looked
eagerly
for
agnes
as
he
walked
up
the
familiar
path
there
stood
the
great
oak
under
whose
shade
he
had
grown
to
be
a
man
how
close
the
great
tree
seemed
to
stand
to
his
heart
someway
as
the
wind
stirred
in
the
leaves
it
was
like
a
rustle
of
greeting
in
that
old
house
they
had
all
lived
and
his
mother
had
toiled
for
thirty
years
a
sort
of
prison
after
all
there
they
were
all
born
and
there
his
father
and
his
little
sister
had
died
and
then
it
passed
into
old
kinney
hands
walking
along
up
the
path
he
felt
a
serious
weakness
in
his
limbs
and
he
made
a
pretence
of
stopping
to
look
at
a
containing
nothing
but
weeds
after
seven
years
of
separation
he
was
about
to
face
once
more
the
woman
whose
life
came
so
near
being
a
part
of
his
agnes
now
a
wife
and
a
mother
how
would
she
look
would
her
face
have
that
peachy
bloom
her
mouth
that
peculiar
beautiful
curve
she
was
large
and
fair
he
recalled
hair
yellow
and
shining
eyes
blue
he
roused
himself
this
was
nonsense
he
was
trembling
he
composed
himself
by
looking
around
again
the
old
scoundrel
has
let
the
weeds
choke
out
the
flowers
and
surround
the
old
man
kinney
never
believed
in
anything
but
a
petty
utility
will
set
his
teeth
and
marched
up
to
the
door
and
struck
it
like
a
man
delivering
a
challenge
kinney
opened
the
door
and
started
back
in
fear
when
he
saw
who
it
was
how
de
do
how
de
do
said
will
walking
in
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
woman
seated
beyond
a
child
in
her
lap
agnes
rose
without
a
word
a
startled
widening
of
the
eyes
her
breath
coming
quick
and
her
face
flushing
they
could
speak
they
only
looked
at
each
other
an
instant
then
will
shivered
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
sat
down
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
old
people
who
were
looking
at
him
in
bewilderment
they
did
not
notice
any
confusion
in
agnes
face
she
recovered
first
i
glad
to
see
you
back
will
she
said
rising
and
putting
the
sleeping
child
down
in
a
neighboring
room
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
said
i
glad
to
get
back
agnes
i
had
ought
to
have
gone
then
he
turned
to
the
old
people
i
will

me
a
turrible
scare
last
night
my
land
scared
me
out
of
a
year
growth
cackled
the
old
man
this
gave
them
all
a
chance
to
laugh
and
the
air
was
cleared
it
gave
agnes
time
to
recover
herself
and
to
be
able
to
meet
will
eyes
will
himself
was
powerfully
moved
his
throat
swelled
and
tears
came
to
his
eyes
every
time
he
looked
at
her
she
was
worn
and
wasted
incredibly
the
blue
of
her
eyes
seemed
dimmed
and
faded
by
weeping
and
the
scarlet
of
her
lips
had
been
washed
away
the
sinews
of
her
neck
showed
painfully
when
she
turned
her
head
and
her
trembling
hands
were
worn
discolored
and
lumpy
at
the
joints
poor
girl
she
knew
she
was
under
scrutiny
and
her
eyes
felt
hot
and
restless
she
wished
to
run
away
and
cry
but
she
dared
not
she
stayed
while
will
began
to
tell
her
of
his
life
and
to
ask
questions
about
old
friends
the
old
people
took
it
up
and
relieved
her
of
any
share
in
it
and
will
seeing
that
she
was
suffering
told
some
funny
stories
which
made
the
old
people
cackle
in
spite
of
themselves
but
it
was
forced
merriment
on
will
part
once
or
twice
agnes
smiled
with
just
a
little
flash
of
the
sunny
temper
but
there
was
no
dimple
in
the
cheek
now
and
the
smile
had
more
suggestion
of
an
invalid
or
even
a
skeleton
he
was
almost
ready
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
weep
her
face
appealed
so
pitifully
to
him
it
most
time
ed
to
be

with

listening
to
the
clack
of
the
old
man
the
room
was
a
poor
little
sitting
room
with
furniture
worn
and
shapeless
hardly
a
touch
of
pleasant
color
save
here
and
there
a
little
bit
of
handiwork
the
lounge
covered
with
calico
was
rickety
the
matched
it
and
the
carpet
of
rags
was
patched
and
darned
with
twine
in
twenty
places

influence

kinneys

he
launched
out
a
long
list
of
grievances
to
which
will
shut
his
ears
as
completely
as
possible
and
was
thinking
how
to

when
there

old
folks
every
time
i
out
o
the
house
the
speaker
was
ed
now
a
tall
and
slouchily
dressed
man
of
or
three
his
face
still
handsome
in
a
certain
dark
style
but
he
wore
a
surly
look
as
he
lounged
in
with
insolent
swagger
clothed
in
greasy
overalls
and
a
hickory
shirt
hello
will
i
heard
you
got
home
john
told
me
as
i
came
along
they
shook
hands
and
ed
slouched
down
on
the
lounge
will
could
have
kicked
him
for
laying
the
blame
of
the
dispute
upon
agnes
it
showed
him
in
a
flash
just
how
he
treated
her
he
disdained
to
quarrel
he
simply
silenced
and
dominated
her
will
asked
a
few
questions
about
crops
with
such
grace
as
he
could
show
and
ed

brutally
unconscious
of
his

jawin

the

comparative
silence
agnes
sobbing
under
breath
the
room
was
small
and
very
hot
the
table
was
warped
so
badly
that
the
dishes
had
a
tendency
to
slide
to
the
centre
the
walls
were
bare
plaster
grayed
with
time
the
food
was
poor
and
scant
and
the
flies
absolutely
swarmed
upon
everything
like
bees

after

he
went
into
the
other
room
leaving
her
to
wash
the
she
worked
on
in
a
curious
almost
dazed
way
a
dream
of
something
sweet
and
irrevocable
in
her
eyes
will
represented
so
much
to
her
his
voice
brought
up
times
and
places
that
thrilled
her
like
song
he
was
associated
with
all
that
was
sweetest
and
most
and
most
girlish
in
her
life
ever
since
the
boy
had
handed
her
that
note
she
had
been
those
days
in
the
midst
of
her
drudgery
she
stopped
to
dream
to
let
some
picture
come
back
into
her
mind
she
was
a
student
again
at
the
seminary
and
stood
in
the
with
suffocating
beat
of
the
heart
will
was
waiting
outside
waiting
in
a
tremor
like
her
own
to
walk
home
with
her
under
the
maples
then
she
remembered
the
painfully
sweet
mixture
of
pride
and
fear
with
which
she
walked
up
the
aisle
of
the
little
church
behind
him
her
pretty
new
gown
rustled
the
dim
light
of
the
church
had
something
like
romance
in
it
and
he
was
so
strong
and
handsome
her
heart
went
out
in
a
great
silent
cry
to
god
oh
let
me
be
a
girl
again
she
did
not
look
forward
to
happiness
she
had
power
to
look
forward
at
all
as
she
worked
she
heard
the
high
shrill
voices
of
the
old
people
as
they
bustled
about
and
nagged
at
each
other
ma
where
my
specticles

agnes

at
the
door
to
watch

drive
away
will
studied
her
a
smothering
ache
in
his
heart
as
he
saw
how
thin
and
bent
and
weary
she
was
in
his
soul
he
felt
that
she
was
a
dying
woman
unless
she
had
rest
and
tender
care
as
she
turned
she
saw
something
in
his
face
a
pity
and
an
agony
of
that
made
her
weak
and
white
she
sank
into
a
chair
putting
her
hand
on
her
chest
as
if
she
felt
a
failing
of
breath
then
the
blood
came
back
to
her
face
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
do
do
look
at
me
like
that
she
said
in
a
whisper
his
pity
hurt
her
at
sight
of
her
sitting
there
pathetic
abashed
bewildered
like
some
gentle
animal
will
throat
contracted
so
that
he
could
not
speak
his
voice
came
at
last
in
one
terrible
cry
oh
agnes
for
god
sake
forgive
me
he
knelt
by
her
side
and
put
his
arm
about
her
shoulders
and
kissed
her
bowed
head
a
curious
numbness
involved
his
whole
body
his
voice
was
husky
the
tears
burned
in
his
eyes
his
whole
soul
and
body
ached
with
his
pity
and
remorseful
wrath
it
was
all
my
fault
lay
it
all
to
me
i
am
the
one
to
bear
it
oh
i
dreamed
a
thousand
times
of
sayin
this
to
you
aggie
i
thought
if
i
could
only
see
you
again
and
ask
your
forgiveness
i
he
ground
his
teeth
together
in
his
assault
upon
himself
i
threw
my
life
away
an
killed
you
that
what
i
did
he
rose
and
raged
up
and
down
the
room
till
he
had
mastered
himself
what
did
you
think
i
meant
that
day
of
the
thrashing
he
said
turning
suddenly
he
spoke
of
it
as
if
it
were
but
a
month
or
two
past
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
in
a
slow
way
she
seemed
to
be
remembering
the
tears
lay
on
her
hollow
cheeks
i
thought
you
was
ashamed
of
me
i
did
know
why
he
uttered
a
snarl
of
you
could
know
nobody
could
tell
what
i
meant
but
why
did
you
write
i
was
ready
to
come
back
i
only
wanted
an
excuse
only
a
line
how
could
i
will
after
your
letter
he
groaned
and
turned
away
and
will
i
i
got
mad
too
i
could
write
oh
that
letter
i
can
see
every
line
of
it
god
sake
think
of
it
again
but
i
did
think
even
when
i
wrote
that
letter
that
i
find
you
where
you
are
i
did
think
i
hoped
anyhow
ed
kinney
would
she
stopped
him
with
a
startled
look
in
her
great
eyes
do
talk
about
him
it
ai
right
i
mean
it
do
do
any
good
what
could
i
do
after
father
died
mother
and
i
besides
i
waited
three
years
to
hear
from
you
will
he
gave
a
strange
choking
cry
it
burst
from
his
throat
that
terrible
thing
a
man
sob
of
agony
she
went
on
curiously
calm
now
ed
was
good
to
me
and
he
offered
a
home
anyway
for
mother
and
all
the
time
i
was
waiting
for
some
line
to
break
down
my
cussed
pride
so
i
could
write
to
you
and
explain
but
you
did
go
with
ed
to
the
fair
he
ended
suddenly
seeking
a
morsel
of
justification
for
himself
yes
but
i
waited
an
waited
and
i
thought
you
was
mad
at
me
so
when
they
came
i
no
i
did
really
go
with
ed
there
was
a
of
them
but
i
started
he
explained
but
the
wheel
came
off
i
did
send
word
because
i
thought
you
feel
sure
i
come
if
you
only
trusted
me
a
little
more
no
it
was
all
my
fault
i
acted
like
a
crazy
fool
i
did
stop
to
reason
about
anything
they
sat
in
silence
after
these
explanations
the
sound
of
the
snapping
wings
of
the
grasshoppers
came
through
the
windows
and
a
locust
high
in
a
poplar
sent
down
his
ringing
whir
it
ca
be
helped
now
will
agnes
said
at
last
her
voice
full
of
the
woman
resignation
we
got
to
bear
it
will
straightened
up
bear
it
he
paused
yes
i
so
if
you
had
married
ed
kinney
anybody
but
him
how
did
you
do
it
oh
i
do
know
she
answered
wearily
brushing
her
hair
back
from
her
eyes
it
seemed
best
when
i
did
it
and
it
ca
be
helped
now
there
was
infinite
dull
despair
and
resignation
in
her
voice
will
went
over
to
the
window
he
thought
how
bright
and
handsome
ed
used
to
be
after
all
it
no
wonder
you
married
him
life
pushes
us
into
such
things
suddenly
he
turned
something
resolute
and
imperious
in
his
eyes
and
voice
it
can
be
helped
aggie
he
said
now
just
listen
to
me
we
made
an
awful
mistake
we
lost
seven
years
o
life
but
that
no
reason
why
we
should
waste
the
rest
of
it
now
hold
on
do
interrupt
me
just
yet
i
come
back
thinking
just
as
much
of
you
as
ever
i
going
to
say
a
word
more
about
ed
let
the
past
stay
past
i
going
to
talk
about
the
future
she
looked
at
him
in
a
daze
of
wonder
as
he
went
on
now
i
got
some
money
i
got
a
third
interest
in
a
ranch
and
got
a
standing
offer
to
go
back
on
the
sante
fee
road
as
conductor
there
is
a
team
standing
out
there
i
like
to
make
another
trip
to
cedarville
with
you
oh
will
do
she
cried
for
pity
sake
do
talk
wait
he
exclaimed
imperiously
now
look
at
it
here
you
are
in
hell
caged
up
with
two
old
crows
picking
the
life
out
of
you
kill
you
i
can
see
it
you
being
killed
by
inches
you
ca
go
anywhere
you
ca
have
anything
life
is
just
torture
for
you
she
gave
a
little
moan
of
anguish
and
despair
and
turned
her
face
to
her
her
shoulders
shook
with
weeping
but
she
listened
he
went
to
her
and
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
his
voice
trembled
and
broke
there
just
one
way
to
get
out
of
this
agnes
come
with
me
he
do
care
for
you
his
whole
idea
of
women
is
that
they
are
created
for
his
pleasure
and
to
keep
house
your
whole
life
is
agony
come
do
cry
there
a
chance
for
life
yet
she
did
speak
but
her
sobs
were
less
violent
his
voice
growing
stronger
reassured
her
i
going
east
maybe
to
europe
and
the
woman
who
goes
with
me
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
get
strong
and
well
again
i
made
you
suffer
so
i
ought
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
making
you
happy
come
my
wife
will
sit
with
me
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
and
see
the
moon
rise
and
walk
with
me
by
the
sea
till
she
gets
strong
and
happy
again
till
the
dimples
get
back
into
her
cheeks
i
never
will
rest
till
i
see
her
eyes
laugh
again
she
rose
flushed
breathing
hard
with
the
emotion
his
vibrant
voice
called
up
but
she
could
not
speak
he
put
his
hand
gently
upon
her
shoulder
and
she
sank
down
again
and
he
went
on
with
his
appeal
there
was
something
hypnotic
dominating
in
his
voice
and
eyes
on
his
part
there
was
no
passion
of
an
ignoble
sort
only
a
passion
of
pity
and
remorse
and
a
sweet
tender
reminiscent
love
he
did
not
love
the
woman
before
him
so
much
as
the
girl
whose
ghost
she
was
the
woman
whose
promise
she
was
he
held
himself
responsible
for
it
all
and
he
throbbed
with
desire
to
repair
the
ravage
he
had
indirectly
caused
there
was
nothing
equivocal
in
his
position
nothing
to
disown
how
others
might
look
at
it
he
did
not
consider
and
did
not
care
his
impetuous
soul
was
carried
to
a
point
where
nothing
came
in
to
mar
or
divert
and
then
after
you
well
after
our
trip
we
come
back
to
houston
or
somewhere
in
texas
and
i
build
my
wife
a
house
that
will
make
her
eyes
shine
my
cattle
will
give
us
a
good
living
and
she
can
have
a
piano
and
books
and
go
to
the
theatre
and
concerts
come
what
do
you
think
of
that
then
she
heard
his
words
beneath
his
voice
somehow
and
they
produced
pictures
that
dazzled
her
luminous
shadows
moved
before
her
eyes
drifting
across
the
gray
background
of
her
poor
starved
life
as
his
voice
ceased
the
rosy
clouds
faded
and
she
realized
again
the
faded
musty
little
room
the
furniture
and
looking
down
at
her
own
cheap
and
dress
she
saw
her
ugly
hands
lying
there
then
she
cried
out
with
a
gush
of
tears
oh
will
i
so
old
and
homely
now
i
ai
fit
to
go
with
you
now
oh
why
could
we
have
married
then
she
was
seeing
herself
as
she
was
then
and
so
was
he
but
it
deepened
his
resolution
how
beautiful
she
used
to
be
he
seemed
to
see
her
there
as
if
she
stood
in
perpetual
sunlight
with
a
warm
sheen
in
her
hair
and
dimples
in
her
cheeks
she
saw
her
thin
red
wrists
her
gaunt
and
knotted
hands
there
was
a
pitiful
droop
in
the
thin
pale
lips
and
the
tears
fell
slowly
from
her
drooping
lashes
he
went
on
well
it
no
use
to
cry
over
what
was
we
must
think
of
what
going
to
do
do
worry
about
your
looks
you
be
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
country
when
we
get
back
do
wait
aggie
make
up
your
mind
she
hesitated
and
was
lost
what
will
people
say
i
do
care
what
they
say
he
flamed
out
they
say
stay
here
and
be
killed
by
inches
i
say
you
had
your
share
of
suffering
say
the
liberal
ones
stay
and
get
a
divorce
but
how
do
you
know
we
can
get
one
after
you
been
dragged
through
the
mud
of
a
trial
we
can
get
one
as
well
in
some
other
state
why
should
you
be
worn
out
at
thirty
what
right
or
justice
is
there
in
making
you
bear
all
your
life
the
consequences
of
our
my
schoolboy
folly
as
he
went
on
his
argument
rose
to
the
level
of
browning
philosophy
we
can
make
this
experience
count
for
us
yet
but
we
must
let
a
mistake
ruin
us
it
should
teach
us
what
right
has
any
one
to
keep
you
in
a
hole
god
do
expect
a
toad
to
stay
in
a
stump
and
starve
if
it
can
get
out
he
do
ask
the
snakes
to
suffer
as
you
do
she
had
lost
the
threads
of
right
and
wrong
out
of
her
hands
she
was
lost
in
a
maze
but
she
was
not
moved
by
passion
flesh
had
ceased
to
stir
her
but
there
was
vast
power
in
the
new
and
thrilling
words
her
deliverer
spoke
he
seemed
to
open
a
door
for
her
and
through
it
turrets
shone
and
great
ships
crossed
on
dim
blue
seas
you
ca
live
here
aggie
you
die
in
less
than
five
years
it
would
kill
me
to
see
you
die
here
come
it
suicide
she
did
not
move
save
the
convulsive
motion
of
her
breath
and
the
nervous
action
of
her
fingers
she
stared
down
at
a
spot
in
the
carpet
she
could
not
face
him
he
grew
insistent
a
sterner
note
creeping
into
his
voice
if
i
leave
this
time
of
course
you
know
i
never
come
back
her
hoarse
breathing
growing
quicker
each
moment
was
her
only
reply
i
done
he
said
with
a
note
of
angry
disappointment
he
did
not
give
her
up
however
i
told
you
what
i
do
for
you
now
if
you
think
oh
give
me
time
to
think
will
she
cried
out
lifting
her
face
he
shook
his
head
no
you
might
as
well
decide
now
it
wo
be
any
easier
come
one
minute
more
and
i
go
out
o
that
door
unless
he
crossed
the
room
slowly
doubtful
himself
of
his
desperate
last
measure
my
hand
is
on
the
knob
shall
i
open
it
she
stopped
breathing
her
fingers
closed
convulsively
on
the
chair
as
he
opened
the
door
she
sprang
up
do
go
will
do
go
please
do
i
need
you
here
i
that
ai
the
question
are
you
going
with
me
agnes
yes

i
tried
to
speak
before
i
trust
you
will
you
he
flung
the
door
open
wide
see
the
sunlight
out
there
shining
on
that
field
o
wheat
that
where
i
take
you
out
into
the
sunshine
you
shall
see
it
shining
on
the
bay
of
naples
come
get
on
your
hat
take
anything
you
actually
need
leave
the
past
behind
you
the
woman
turned
wildly
and
darted
into
the
little
bedroom
the
man
listened
he
whistled
in
surprise
almost
comical
he
had
forgotten
the
baby
he
could
hear
the
mother
talking
cooing
mommie
pet
she
was
goin
to
leave
her
man
no
she
was
there
there
do
cry
mommie
ai
goin
away
and
leave
him
wicked
mommie
ai
treasure
she
was
confused
again
and
when
she
reappeared
at
the
door
with
the
child
in
her
arms
there
was
a
wandering
look
on
her
face
pitiful
to
see
she
tried
to
speak
tried
to
say
please
go
will
he
designedly
failed
to
understand
her
whisper
he
stepped
forward
the
baby
sure
enough
why
certainly
to
the
mother
belongs
the
child
blue
eyes
thank
heaven
he
put
his
arm
about
them
both
she
obeyed
silently
there
was
something
irresistible
in
his
frank
clear
eyes
his
sunny
smile
his
strong
brown
hand
he
slammed
the
door
behind
them
that
closes
the
door
on
your
sufferings
he
said
smiling
down
at
her
to
it
all
the
baby
laughed
and
stretched
out
its
hands
toward
the
light
boo
boo
he
cried
what
he
talking
about
she
smiled
in
perfect
trust
and
fearlessness
seeing
her
child
face
beside
his
own
he
says
it
beautiful
oh
he
does
i
ca
follow
his
french
accent
she
smiled
again
in
spite
of
herself
will
shuddered
with
a
thrill
of
fear
she
was
so
weak
and
worn
but
the
sun
shone
on
the
dazzling
rustling
wheat
the
fathomless
sky
blue
as
a
sea
bent
above
them
and
the
world
lay
before
them
up
the
coolly
keep
the
road
up
the
coolly
it
the
second
house
after
crossin
the
crick
i
the
ride
from
milwaukee
to
the
mississippi
is
a
fine
ride
at
any
time
superb
in
summer
to
lean
back
in
a
and
whirl
away
in
a
breezy
july
day
past
lakes
groves
of
oak
past
fields
of
barley
being
reaped
past
where
the
heavy
grass
is
toppling
before
the
swift
sickle
is
a
panorama
of
delight
a
road
full
of
delicious
surprises
where
down
a
sudden
vista
lakes
open
or
a
distant
wooded
hill
looms
darkly
blue
or
swift
streams
foaming
deep
down
the
solid
rock
send
whiffs
of
cool
breezes
in
at
the
window
it
has
majesty
breadth
the
farming
has
nothing
apparently
petty
about
it
all
seems
vigorous
youthful
and
prosperous
howard
mclane
in
his
chair
let
his
newspaper
fall
on
his
lap
and
gazed
out
upon
it
with
dreaming
eyes
it
had
a
certain
mysterious
glamour
to
him
the
lakes
were
cooler
and
brighter
to
his
eye
the
greens
fresher
and
the
grain
more
golden
than
to
any
one
else
for
he
was
coming
back
to
it
all
after
an
absence
of
ten
years
it
was
besides
his
west
he
still
took
pride
in
being
a
western
man
his
mind
all
day
flew
ahead
of
the
train
to
the
little
town
far
on
toward
the
mississippi
where
he
had
spent
his
boyhood
and
youth
as
the
train
passed
the
wisconsin
river
with
its
curiously
carved
cliffs
its
cold
dark
water
eating
slowly
under
banks
howard
began
to
feel
curious
little
movements
of
the
heart
like
those
of
a
lover
nearing
his
sweetheart
the
hills
changed
in
character
growing
more
intimately
recognizable
they
rose
higher
as
the
train
left
the
ridge
and
passed
down
into
the
black
river
valley
and
specifically
into
the
la
crosse
valley
they
ceased
to
have
any
hint
of
upheavals
of
rock
and
became
simply
parts
of
the
ancient
level
left
standing
after
the
water
had
practically
given
up
its
scooping
action
it
was
about
six
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
splendid
broken
line
of
hills
on
which
his
baby
eyes
had
looked
years
ago
a
few
minutes
later
and
the
train
drew
up
at
the
grimy
little
station
set
into
the
hillside
and
giving
him
just
time
to
leap
off
plunged
on
again
toward
the
west
howard
felt
a
ridiculous
weakness
in
his
legs
as
he
stepped
out
upon
the
splintery
planks
of
the
station
and
faced
the
few
idlers
lounging
about
he
simply
stood
and
gazed
with
the
same
intensity
and
absorption
one
of
the
idlers
might
show
standing
before
the
brooklyn
bridge
the
town
caught
and
held
his
eyes
first
how
poor
and
dull
and
sleepy
and
squalid
it
seemed
the
one
main
street
ended
at
the
hillside
at
his
left
and
stretched
away
to
the
north
between
two
rows
of
the
usual
village
stores
unrelieved
by
a
tree
or
a
touch
of
beauty
an
unpaved
street
with
walled
miserable
rotting
wooden
buildings
with
the
inevitable
battlements
the
same
only
worse
and
more
squalid
was
the
town
the
same
only
more
beautiful
still
was
the
majestic
amphitheatre
of
green
wooded
hills
that
circled
the
horizon
and
toward
which
he
lifted
his
eyes
he
thrilled
at
the
sight
glorious
he
cried
involuntarily
accustomed
to
the
white
mountains
to
the
alleghanies
he
had
wondered
if
these
hills
would
retain
their
charm
they
did
he
took
off
his
hat
to
them
as
he
stood
there
richly
wooded
with
gently
sloping
green
sides
rising
to
massive
square
or
rounded
tops
with
dim
vistas
they
glowed
down
upon
the
squat
little
town
gracious
lofty
in
their
greeting
immortal
in
their
vivid
and
delicate
beauty
he
was
a
goodly
figure
of
a
man
as
he
stood
there
beside
his
valise
portly
erect
handsomely
dressed
and
with
something
unusually
winning
in
his
brown
mustache
and
blue
eyes
something
scholarly
suggested
by
the
glasses
something
strong
in
the
repose
of
the
head
he
smiled
as
he
saw
how
unchanged
was
the
grouping
of
the
old
loafers
on
the
and
he
recognized
most
of
them
a
little
dirtier
a
little
more
bent
and
a
little
grayer
they
sat
in
the
same
attitudes
spat
tobacco
with
the
same
calm
delight
and
joked
each
other
breaking
into
short
and
sudden
fits
of
laughter
and
pounded
each
other
on
the
back
just
as
when
he
was
a
student
at
the
la
crosse
seminary
and
going
to
and
fro
daily
on
the
train
they
ruminated
on
him
as
he
passed
speculating
in
a
perfectly
audible
way
upon
his
business
looks
like
a
drummer
no
he
ai
no
drummer
see
them
boston
glasses
that
so
guess
he
a
teacher
looks
like
a
moneyed
cuss
i
guess
he
knew
the
one
who
spoke
last
freeme
cole
a
man
who
was
the
fighting
wonder
of
howard
boyhood
now
degenerated
into
a
faded
garrulous
and
quarrelsome
old
man
yet
there
was
something
epic
in
the
old
man
stories
something
enthralling
in
the
dramatic
power
of
recital
over
by
the
blacksmith
shop
the
usual
game
of
quaits
was
in
progress
and
the
on
the
corner
was
chasing
a
crony
with
the
with
which
he
was
about
to
wash
the
windows
a
few
teams
stood
in
the
mud
tied
to
the
fantastically
gnawed
pine
pillars
of
the
wooden
awnings
a
man
on
a
load
of
hay
was
jawing
with
the
attendant
of
the
platform
scales
who
stood
below
pad
and
pencil
in
hand
hit
hit
jump
off
and
knock
suggested
a
bystander
jovially
howard
knew
the
voice
talk
cheap
takes
money
to
buy
whiskey
he
said
when
the
man
on
the
load
repeated
his
threat
of
getting
off
and
whipping
the
you
william
mcturg
howard
said
coming
up
to
him
i
am
sir
replied
the
giant
turning
and
looking
down
on
the
stranger
with
an
amused
twinkle
in
his
deep
brown
eyes
he
stood
as
erect
as
an
indian
though
his
hair
and
beard
were
white
i
howard
mclane
ye
begin
t
look
it
said
mcturg
removing
his
right
hand
from
his
pocket
how
are
yeh
i
how
mother
and
grant
saw
ploughing
corn
as
i
came
down
guess
he
all
right
want
a
boost
well
yes
are
you
down
with
a
team
yep
goin
home
climb
right
in
that
my
rig
right
there
nodding
at
a
sleek
bay
colt
hitched
in
a
covered
buggy
heave
grip
under
the
seat
they
climbed
into
the
seat
after
william
had
lowered
the
and
unhitched
the
horse
from
the
post
the
loafers
were
mildly
curious
guessed
bill
had
got
hooked
onto
by
a
peddler
or
somethin
o
that
kind
want
to
go
by
river
or
by
the
hills
hills
i
guess
the
whole
matter
began
to
seem
trivial
as
if
he
had
been
away
only
for
a
month
or
two
william
mcturg
was
a
man
little
given
to
talk
even
the
coming
back
of
a
nephew
did
not
cause
any
flow
of
questions
or
reminiscences
they
rode
in
silence
he
sat
a
little
bent
forward
the
lines
held
carelessly
in
his
hands
his
great
head
swaying
to
and
fro
with
the
movement
of
the
buggy
as
they
passed
familiar
spots
the
younger
man
broke
the
silence
with
a
question
that
old
man
mcelvaine
place
ai
it
yep
old
man
living
i
guess
he
is
husk
more
any
man
he
hire
in
the
edge
of
the
village
they
passed
an
open
lot
on
the
left
marked
with
of
different
eras
there
the
old
do
they
have
circuses
on
it
just
the
same
as
ever
just
the
same
what
fun
that
field
calls
up
the
games
of
ball
we
used
to
have
do
you
play
yet
sometimes
ca
stoop
as
well
as
i
used
to
he
smiled
a
little
too
much
fat
it
all
swept
back
upon
howard
in
a
flood
of
names
and
faces
and
sights
and
sounds
something
sweet
and
stirring
somehow
though
it
had
little
of
æsthetic
charms
at
the
time
they
were
passing
along
lanes
now
between
superb
fields
of
corn
wherein
ploughmen
were
at
work
kingbirds
flew
from
post
to
post
ahead
of
them
the
insects
called
from
the
grass
the
valley
slowly
outspread
below
them
the
workmen
in
the
fields
were
turning
out
for
the
night
they
all
had
a
word
of
chaff
with
mcturg
over
the
western
wall
of
the
circling
amphitheatre
the
sun
was
setting
a
few
scattering
clouds
were
drifting
on
the
west
wind
their
shadows
sliding
down
the
green
and
purpled
slopes
the
dazzling
sunlight
flamed
along
the
luscious
velvety
grass
and
shot
amid
the
rounded
distant
purple
peaks
and
streamed
in
bars
of
gold
and
crimson
across
the
blue
mist
of
the
narrower
upper
coollies
the
heart
of
the
young
man
swelled
with
pleasure
almost
like
pain
and
the
eyes
of
the
silent
older
man
took
on
a
dreaming
look
as
he
gazed
at
the
scene
which
had
repeated
itself
a
thousand
times
in
his
life
but
of
whose
beauty
he
never
spoke
far
down
to
the
left
was
the
break
in
the
wall
through
which
the
river
ran
on
its
way
to
join
the
mississippi
they
climbed
slowly
among
the
hills
and
the
valley
they
had
left
grew
still
more
beautiful
as
the
squalor
of
the
little
town
was
hid
by
the
dusk
of
distance
both
men
were
silent
for
a
long
time
howard
knew
the
peculiarities
of
his
companion
too
well
to
make
any
remarks
or
ask
any
questions
and
besides
it
was
a
genuine
pleasure
to
ride
with
one
who
understood
that
silence
was
the
only
speech
amid
such
splendors
once
they
passed
a
little
brook
singing
in
a
mournfully
sweet
way
its
eternal
song
over
its
pebbles
it
called
back
to
howard
the
days
when
he
and
grant
his
younger
brother
had
fished
in
this
little
brook
for
trout
with
trousers
rolled
above
the
knee
and
wrecks
of
hats
upon
their
heads
any
trout
left
he
asked
not
many
little
fellers
finding
the
silence
broken
william
asked
the
first
question
since
he
met
howard
le
see
you
a
show
feller
now
to
a
troupe
yes
yes
i
an
actor
pay
much
pretty
well
that
seemed
to
end
william
curiosity
about
the
matter
ah
there
our
old
house
ai
it
howard
broke
out
pointing
to
one
of
the
houses
farther
up
the
coolly
it
be
a
surprise
to
them
it
yep
only
they
do
live
there
what
they
do
who
does
dutchman
howard
was
silent
for
some
moments
who
lives
on
the
dunlap
place
dutchman
where
grant
living
anyhow
farther
up
the
coolly
well
then
i
better
get
out
here
had
i
oh
i
drive
ye
up
no
i
rather
walk
the
sun
had
set
and
the
coolly
was
getting
dusk
when
howard
got
out
of
mcturg
carriage
and
set
off
up
the
winding
lane
toward
his
house
he
walked
slowly
to
absorb
the
coolness
and
fragrance
and
color
of
the
hour
the
katydids
sang
a
rhythmic
song
of
welcome
to
him
fireflies
were
in
the
grass
a
whippoorwill
in
the
deep
of
the
wood
was
calling
weirdly
and
an
occasional
flying
high
gave
his
grating
shriek
or
hollow
boom
suggestive
and
resounding
he
had
been
wonderfully
successful
and
yet
had
carried
into
his
success
as
a
dramatic
author
as
well
as
actor
a
certain
puritanism
that
made
him
a
paradox
to
his
fellows
he
was
one
of
those
actors
who
are
always
in
luck
and
the
best
of
it
was
he
kept
and
made
use
of
his
luck
jovial
as
he
appeared
he
was
inflexible
as
granite
against
drink
and
tobacco
he
retained
through
it
all
a
certain
freshness
of
enjoyment
that
made
him
one
of
the
best
companions
in
the
profession
and
now
as
he
walked
on
the
hour
and
the
place
appealed
to
him
with
great
power
it
seemed
to
sweep
away
the
life
that
came
between
how
close
it
all
was
to
him
after
all
in
his
restless
life
surrounded
by
the
glare
of
electric
lights
painted
canvas
hot
colors
creak
of
machinery
mock
trees
stones
and
brooks
he
had
not
lost
but
gained
appreciation
for
the
coolness
quiet
and
low
tones
the
shyness
of
the
wood
and
field
in
the
farmhouse
ahead
of
him
a
light
was
shining
as
he
peered
ahead
and
his
heart
gave
another
painful
movement
his
brother
was
awaiting
him
there
and
his
mother
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
ten
years
and
who
had
lost
the
power
to
write
and
when
grant
wrote
which
had
been
more
and
more
seldom
of
late
his
letters
had
been
cold
and
curt
he
began
to
feel
that
in
the
pleasure
and
excitement
of
his
life
he
had
grown
away
from
his
mother
and
brother
each
summer
he
had
said
well
now
i
go
home
this
year
sure
but
a
new
play
to
be
produced
or
a
new
yachting
trip
or
a
tour
of
europe
had
put
the
off
and
now
it
was
with
a
distinct
consciousness
of
neglect
of
duty
that
he
walked
up
to
the
fence
and
looked
into
the
yard
where
william
had
told
him
his
brother
lived
it
was
humble
enough
a
small
white
structure
with
a
wing
set
in
the
midst
of
a
few
a
small
barn
with
a
sagging
a
barnyard
full
of
mud
in
which
a
few
cows
were
standing
fighting
the
flies
and
waiting
to
be
milked
an
old
man
was
pumping
water
at
the
well
the
pigs
were
squealing
from
a
pen
near
by
a
child
was
crying
instantly
the
beautiful
peaceful
valley
was
forgotten
a
sickening
chill
struck
into
howard
soul
as
he
looked
at
it
all
in
the
dim
light
he
could
see
a
figure
milking
a
cow
leaving
his
valise
at
the
gate
he
entered
and
walked
up
to
the
old
man
who
had
finished
pumping
and
was
about
to
go
to
feed
the
hogs
howard
began
does
grant
mclane
live
here
yes
sir
he
does
he
right
over
there
milkin
i
go
over
there
an
do
i
would
it
darn
muddy
over
there
it
been
turrible
rainy
he
be
done
in
a
minute
anyway
very
well
i
wait
as
he
waited
he
could
hear
a
woman
fretful
voice
and
the
impatient
jerk
and
jar
of
kitchen
things
indicative
of
or
worry
the
longer
he
stood
absorbing
this
with
all
its
sordidness
dullness
triviality
and
its
endless
drudgeries
the
lower
his
heart
sank
all
the
joy
of
the
was
gone
when
the
figure
arose
from
the
cow
and
approached
the
gate
and
put
the
pail
of
milk
down
on
the
platform
by
the
pump
said
howard
out
of
the
dusk
grant
stared
a
moment
howard
knew
the
voice
though
it
was
older
and
deeper
and
more
sullen
do
you
know
me
grant
i
am
howard
the
man
approached
him
gazing
intently
at
his
face
you
are
after
a
pause
well
i
glad
to
see
you
but
i
ca
shake
hands
that
damned
cow
had
laid
down
in
the
mud
they
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
howard
cuffs
collar
and
shirt
alien
in
their
elegance
showed
through
the
dusk
and
a
glint
of
light
shot
out
from
the
jewel
of
his
necktie
as
the
light
from
the
house
caught
it
at
the
right
angle
as
they
gazed
in
silence
at
each
other
howard
divined
something
of
the
hard
bitter
feeling
that
came
into
grant
heart
as
he
stood
there
ragged
in
muck
his
sleeves
rolled
up
a
shapeless
old
straw
hat
on
his
head
the
gleam
of
howard
white
hands
angered
him
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
hard
gruff
tone
full
of
rebellion
well
go
in
the
house
and
set
down
i
be
in
soon
i
strain
the
milk
and
wash
the
dirt
off
my
hands
but
mother
she
somewhere
just
knock
on
the
door
under
the
porch
round
there
howard
went
slowly
around
the
corner
of
the
house
past
a
vilely
smelling
toward
the
west
a
woman
was
sitting
in
a
on
the
porch
her
hands
in
her
lap
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
faintly
yellow
sky
against
which
the
hills
stood
dim
purple
silhouettes
and
on
which
the
locust
trees
were
etched
as
fine
as
lace
there
was
sorrow
resignation
and
a
sort
of
dumb
despair
in
her
attitude
howard
stood
his
throat
swelling
till
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
suffocate
this
was
his
mother
the
woman
who
bore
him
the
being
who
had
taken
her
life
in
her
hand
for
him
and
he
in
his
excited
and
pleasurable
life
had
neglected
her
he
stepped
into
the
faint
light
before
her
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
without
fear
mother
he
said
she
uttered
one
little
breathing
gasping
cry
called
his
name
rose
and
stood
still
he
bounded
up
the
steps
and
took
her
in
his
arms
mother
dear
old
mother
in
the
silence
almost
painful
which
followed
an
angry
woman
voice
could
be
heard
inside
i
do
care
i
ai
goin
to
wear
myself
out
fer
him
he
eat
out
here
with
us
or

mclane

speaking
oh

to

was
afraid

too
late
what

and
knit

little
i
tried
to
pick
some
berries
the
other
day
and
i

so
dizzy
i
had
to
give
it
up

work

why

howard
asked
in
an
agony
of
remorse
well
we
felt
as
if
you
probably
had
all
you
could
do
to
take
care
of
yourself
are
you
married
howard
she
broke
off
to
ask
no
mother
and
there
ai
any
excuse
for
me
not
a
bit
he
said
dropping
back
into
her
colloquialisms
i
ashamed
when
i
think
of
how
long
it
been
since
i
saw
you
i
could
have
come
it
do
matter
now
she
interrupted
gently
it
the
way
things
go
our
boys
grow
up
and
leave
us
well
come
in
to
supper
said
grant
ungracious
voice
from
the
doorway
come
mother
mclane
moved
with
difficulty
howard
sprang
to
her
aid
and
leaning
on
his
arm
she
went
through
the
little
sitting
room
which
was
unlighted
out
into
the
kitchen
where
the
supper
table
stood
near
the
this
is
my
wife
said
grant
in
a
cold
peculiar
tone
howard
bowed
toward
a
remarkably
handsome
young
woman
on
whose
forehead
was
a
scowl
which
did
not
change
as
she
looked
at
him
and
the
old
lady
set
down
anywhere
was
the
young
woman
cordial
invitation
howard
sat
down
next
his
mother
and
facing
the
wife
who
had
a
small
fretful
child
in
her
arms
at
howard
left
was
the
old
man
lewis
the
supper
was
spread
upon
a
and
consisted
of
a
pan
of
milk
set
in
the
midst
with
bowls
at
each
plate
beside
the
pan
was
a
dipper
and
a
large
plate
of
bread
and
at
one
end
of
the
table
was
a
dish
of
fine
honey
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
leaned
upon
the
table
his
bent
shoulders
making
him
look
like
an
old
man
his
hickory
shirt
like
grant
was
still
wet
with
sweat
and
discolored
here
and
there
with
grease
or
green
from
grass
his
hair
freshly
wet
and
combed
was
smoothed
away
from
his
face
and
shone
in
the
light
of
the
kerosene
lamp
as
he
ate
he
stared
at
howard
as
though
he
would
make
an
inventory
of
each
thread
of
the
visitor
clothing
did
i
look
like
that
at
his
age
thought
howard
you
see
we
live
just
about
the
same
as
ever
said
grant
as
they
began
eating
speaking
with
a
grim
almost
challenging
inflection
the
two
brothers
studied
each
other
curiously
as
they
talked
of
neighborhood
scenes
howard
seemed
incredibly
elegant
and
handsome
to
them
all
with
his
rich
soft
clothing
his
spotless
linen
and
his
exquisite
enunciation
and
ease
of
speech
he
had
always
been
and
he
had
become
elegantly
persuasive
as
his
friends
said
of
him
and
it
was
a
large
factor
in
his
success
every
detail
of
the
kitchen
the
heat
the
flies
buzzing
aloft
the
poor
furniture
the
dress
of
the
people
all
smote
him
like
the
lash
of
a
wire
whip
his
brother
was
a
man
of
great
character
he
could
see
that
now
his
gray
eyes
and
rugged
face
showed
at
thirty
a
man
of
great
natural
ability
he
had
more
of
the
scotch
in
his
face
than
howard
and
he
looked
much
older
he
was
dressed
like
the
old
man
and
the
boy
in
a
checked
shirt
without
vest
his
suspenders
once
had
given
most
of
their
color
to
his
shirt
and
had
marked
irregular
broad
bands
of
pink
and
brown
and
green
over
his
shoulders
his
hair
was
uncombed
merely
pushed
away
from
his
face
he
wore
a
mustache
only
though
his
face
was
covered
with
a
week
growth
of
beard
his
face
was
rather
gaunt
and
was
brown
as
leather
howard
could
not
eat
much
he
was
disturbed
by
his
mother
strange
silence
and
oppression
and
sickened
by
the
gasps
with
which
the
old
man
ate
his
bread
and
milk
and
by
the
way
the
boy
ate
he
had
his
knife
gripped
tightly
in
his
fist
knuckles
up
and
was
scooping
honey
upon
his
bread
the
baby
having
ceased
to
be
afraid
was
curious
gazing
silently
at
the
stranger
hello
little
one
come
and
see
your
uncle
eh
course
will
cooed
howard
in
the
attempt
to
escape
the
depressing
atmosphere
the
little
one
listened
to
his
inflections
as
a
kitten
does
and
at
last
lifted
its
arms
in
sign
of
surrender
the
mother
face
cleared
up
a
little
i
declare
she
wants
to
go
to
you
course
she
does
dogs
and
kittens
always
come
to
me
when
i
call
why
should
my
own
niece
come
he
took
the
little
one
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
kitchen
with
her
while
she
pulled
at
his
beard
and
nose
i
ought
to
have
you
my
lady
in
my
new
comedy

the
house

howard
said
his
mother
in
surprise

days

another
way
of

i

darkly
meditative
howard
went
on
how

to
sell
the
old
farm

was
in
hopes

with
terrible
bitterness

howard

the
baby

and
faced
his
brother
why

refused
to
help

it
looked
that
way
we

only
i
do
want
him
to
come
the
brotherly
business
over
me
after
livin
as
he
has
that
all
there
was
a
bitter
accusation
in
the
man
voice
howard
leaped
to
his
feet
his
face
twitching
by
god
i
go
back
morning
he
threatened
go
an
be
damned
i
do
care

growled
rising
and
going
out
boys
called
the
mother
piteously
it
terrible
to
see
you
quarrel
but
i
not
to
blame
mother
cried
howard
in
a
sickness
that
made
him
white
as
chalk
the
man
is
a
savage
i
came
home
to
help
you
all
not
to
quarrel
grant

o
his

the
young
wife
speaking
for
the
first
time

any
attention
to
him
he
be
all
right
in
the
morning
if
it
was
for
you
mother
i
leave
now
and
never
see
that
savage
again
he
lashed
himself
up
and
down
in
the
room
in
horrible
disgust
and
hate
of
his
brother
and
of
this
home
in
his
heart
he
remembered
his
tender
anticipations
of
the
with
a
kind
of
and
disgust
this
was
his
greeting
he
went
to
bed
to
toss
about
on
the
hard
mattress
in
the
stuffy
little
best
room
tossing
writhing
under
the
bludgeoning
of
his
brother
accusing
inflections
a
dozen
times
he
said
with
a
snarl
he
can
go
to
hell
i
not
try
to
do
anything
more
for
him
i
care
if
he
is
my
brother
he
has
no
right
to
jump
on
me
like
that
on
the
night
of
my
return
too
my
god
he
is
a
brute
a
fool
he
thought
of
the
presents
in
his
trunk
and
valise
which
he
show
to
him
that
night
after
what
had
been
said
he
had
intended
to
have
such
a
happy
evening
of
it
such
a
tender
reunion
it
was
to
be
so
bright
and
cheery
in
the
midst
of
his
cursings
his
hot
indignation
would
come
visions
of
himself
in
his
own
modest
rooms
he
seemed
to
be
yawning
and
stretching
in
his
beautiful
bed
the
sun
shining
in
his
books
foils
pictures
around
him
to
say
and
tempt
him
to
rise
while
the
squat
little
clock
on
the
mantel
struck
eleven
warningly
he
could
see
the
olive
walls
the
unique
arabesque
frieze
his
own
selection
and
the
delicate
draperies
an
open
grate
full
of
glowing
coals
to
temper
the
and
in
the
midst
of
it
between
a
landscape
by
enneking
and
an
indian
in
a
canoe
in
a
cañon
by
brush
he
saw
a
sombre
landscape
by
a
master
greater
than
millet
a
melancholy
subject
treated
with
pitiless
fidelity
a
farm
in
the
valley
over
the
mountains
swept
jagged
gray
angry
sprawling
clouds
sending
a
freezing
thin
drizzle
of
rain
as
they
passed
upon
a
man
following
a
plough
the
horses
had
a
sullen
and
weary
look
and
their
manes
and
tails
streamed
sidewise
in
the
blast
the
ploughman
clad
in
a
ragged
gray
coat
with
uncouth
muddy
boots
upon
his
feet
walked
with
his
head
inclined
toward
the
sleet
to
shield
his
face
from
the
cold
and
sting
of
it
the
soil
rolled
away
black
and
sticky
and
with
a
dull
sheen
upon
it
near
by
a
boy
with
tears
on
his
cheeks
was
watching
cattle
a
dog
seated
near
his
back
to
the
gale
as
he
looked
at
this
picture
his
heart
softened
he
looked
down
at
the
sleeve
of
his
soft
and
fleecy
nightshirt
at
his
white
rounded
arm
muscular
yet
fine
as
a
woman
and
when
he
looked
for
the
picture
it
was
gone
then
came
again
the
assertive
odor
of
stagnant
air
laden
with
camphor
he
felt
the
springless
bed
under
him
and
caught
dimly
a
few
lithographs
on
the
walls
he
thought
of
his
brother
in
his
still
more
inhospitable
bedroom
disturbed
by
the
child
condemned
to
rise
at
five
and
begin
another
day
pitiless
labor
his
heart
shrank
and
quivered
and
the
tears
started
to
his
eyes
i
forgive
him
poor
fellow
he
not
to
blame
ii
he
woke
however
with
a
dull
languid
pulse
and
an
oppressive
melancholy
on
his
heart
he
looked
around
the
little
room
clean
enough
but
oh
how
poor
how
barren
cold
plaster
walls
a
cheap
a
of
three
pieces
with
a
blue
band
around
each
the
windows
rectangular
and
fitted
with
fantastic
green
shades
outside
he
could
hear
the
bees
humming
chickens
were
merrily
moving
about
far
up
the
road
were
sounding
irregularly
a
jay
came
by
and
yelled
an
insolent
reveille
and
howard
sat
up
he
could
hear
nothing
in
the
house
but
the
rattle
of
pans
on
the
back
side
of
the
kitchen
he
looked
at
his
watch
which
indicated
seven
grant
was
already
in
the
field
after
milking
currying
the
horses
and
eating
breakfast
had
been
at
work
two
hours
and
a
half
he
dressed
himself
hurriedly
in
a
negligé
shirt
with
a
windsor
scarf
serviceable
trousers
with
a
belt
russet
shoes
and
a
tennis
hat
a
knockabout
costume
he
considered
his
mother
good
soul
thought
it
a
special
suit
put
on
for
her
benefit
and
admired
it
through
her
glasses
he
kissed
her
with
a
bright
smile
nodded
at
laura
the
young
wife
and
tossed
the
baby
all
in
a
breath
and
with
the
manner
as
he
himself
saw
of
the
returned
captain
in
the
of
the
day
been
to
breakfast
he
frowned
reproachfully
why
did
you
call
me
i
wanted
to
get
up
just
as
i
used
to
at
sunrise
we
thought
you
was
tired
and
so
we
did
tired
just
wait
till
you
see
me
help
grant
pitch
hay
or
something
has
finished
his
haying
yet

he
no
i
guess
not
he
will
if
it
do
rain
again
well

howard
said
laura
hesitating
a
little
on
his
name
good

ready

it
bacon
and
eggs
as
i
a
jay
just
what
i
was

saying
to
myself

they
only

bacon
and
eggs
and
hot
biscuits
and
honey
oh

mother
i
heard
the
bees
humming
this
morning
same
noise
they
used
to
make
when
i
was
a
boy
exactly
must
be
the
same
bees

rascal

some
breakfast

uncle

one
so
quick
laura
said
emphasizing
the
baby
sex
she
had
on
a
clean
calico
dress
and
a
gingham
apron
and
she
looked
strong
and
fresh
and
handsome
her
head
was
intellectual
her
eyes
full
of
power
she
seemed
anxious
to
remove
the
impression
of
her
unpleasant
looks
and
words
the
night
before
indeed
it
would
have
been
hard
to
resist
howard
sunny
the
baby
laughed
and
crowed
the
old
mother
could
not
take
her
dim
eyes
off
the
face
of
her
son
but
sat
smiling
at
him
as
he
ate
and
rattled
on
when
he
rose
from
the
table
at
last
after
eating
heartily
and
praising
it
all
he
said
with
a
smile
well
now

to
the
express
and
have
my
trunk
brought
up
i
got
a
few
little
things

the
baby

take
him
into
account
but

as
they
went
out
into
the
best
room
of
course

he
did
mean
it
now
ca

word
down

trunk

have
to
walk
down
i
guess
i
see
somebody
goin
down
said
laura
all
right
now
for
the
he
smiled
and
went
out
into
the
glorious
morning
the
circling
hills
were
the
same
yet
not
the
same
as
at
night
a
cooler
tenderer
more
subdued
cloak
of
color
lay
upon
them
far
down
the
valley
a
cool
deep
impalpable
blue
mist
hung
beneath
which
one
divined
the
river
ran
under
its
elms
and
basswoods
and
wild
grapevines
on
the
shaven
slopes
of
the
hill
cattle
and
sheep
were
feeding
their
cries
and
bells
coming
to
the
ear
with
a
sweet
suggestiveness
there
was
something
immemorial
in
the
sunny
slopes
dotted
with
red
and
brown
and
gray
cattle
walking
toward
the
haymakers
howard
felt
a
twinge
of
pain
and
distrust
would
grant
ignore
it
all
and
smile
he
stopped
short
he
had
not
seen
grant
smile
in
so
long
he
quite
see
him
smiling
he
had
been
cold
and
bitter
for
years
when
he
came
up
to
them
grant
was
pitching
on
the
old
man
was
loading
and
the
boy
was
raking
after
howard
cried
cheerily
the
old
man
nodded
the
boy
stared
grant
growled
something
without
looking
up
these
finical
things
of
saying
and
are
not
much
practised
in
such
homes
as
grant
mclane
need
some
help
i
ready
to
take
a
hand
got
on
my
regimentals
this
morning
grant
looked
at
him
a
moment
you
look
it
howard
smiled
gim
me
a
hold
on
that
fork
and
i
show
you
i
not
so
soft
as
i
look
now
you
bet
he
laid
hold
upon
the
fork
in
grant
hands
who
released
it
sullenly
and
stood
back
sneering
howard
struck
the
fork
into
the
pile
in
the
old
way
threw
his
left
hand
to
the
end
of
the
polished
handle
brought
it
down
into
the
hollow
of
his
thigh
and
laid
out
his
strength
till
the
handle
bent
like
a
bow
oop
she
rises
he
called
laughingly
as
the
whole
pile
began
slowly
to
rise
and
finally
rolled
upon
the
high
load
oh
i
ai
forgot
how
to
do
it
he
laughed
as
he
looked
around
at
the
boy
who
was
eyeing
the
tennis
suit
with
a
devouring
gaze
grant
was
studying
him
too
but
not
in
admiration
i
should
say
you
had
said
the
old
man
tugging
at
the
forkful
mighty
funny
to
come
out
here
and
do
a
little
of
this
but
if
you
had
to
come
here
and
do
it
all
the
while
you
would
look
so
white
and
soft
in
the
hands
grant
said
as
they
moved
on
to
another
pile
give
me
that
fork
you
be
spoiling
your
fine
clothes
oh
these
do
matter
they
made
for
this
kind
of
thing
oh
are
they
i
guess
i
dress
in
that
kind
of
a
rig
what
did
that
shirt
cost
i
need
one
six
dollars
a
pair
but
then
it
old
and
them
pants
he
pursued
they
cost
six
dollars
too
did
they
howard
face
darkened
he
saw
his
brother
purpose
he
resented
it
they
cost
fifteen
dollars
if
you
want
to
know
and
the
shoes
cost
this
ring
on
my
cravat
cost
sixty
dollars
and
the
suit
i
had
on
last
night
cost
my
suits
are
made
by
breckstein
on
fifth
avenue
if
you
want
to
patronize
him
he
ended
brutally
spurred
on
by
the
sneer
in
his
brother
eyes
i
introduce
you
good
idea
said
grant
with
a
forced
mocking
smile
i
need
just
such
a
for
haying
and
singular
i
never
thought
of
it
now
my
pants
cost
cents
fifteen
hat
twenty
shoes
stockin
i
do
bother
about
he
had
his
brother
at
a
disadvantage
and
he
grew
fluent
and
caustic
as
he
went
on
almost
changing
places
with
howard
who
took
the
rake
out
of
the
boy
hand
and
followed
raking
up
the
scatterings
singular
we
fellers
here
are
discontented
and
mulish
ai
it
singular
we
do
believe
your
letters
when
you
write
sayin
just
about
make
a
live
of
it
singular
we
think
the
country
goin
to
hell
we
fellers
in
a
suit
wadin
around
in
the
mud
or
around
in
the
while
you
fellers
lay
around
new
york
and
smoke
and
wear
good
clothes
and
toady
to
millionaires
howard
threw
down
the
rake
and
folded
his
arms
my
god
you
enough
to
make
a
man
forget
the
same
mother
bore
us
i
guess
it
would
take
much
to
make
you
forget
that
you
ai
put
much
thought
on
me
nor
her
for
ten
years
the
old
man
cackled
the
boy
grinned
and
howard
sick
and
weak
with
anger
and
sorrow
turned
away
and
walked
down
toward
the
brook
he
had
tried
once
more
to
get
near
his
brother
and
had
failed
oh
god
how
miserably
pitiably
the
hot
blood
gushed
all
over
him
as
he
thought
of
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
it
he
a
man
associating
with
poets
artists
sought
after
by
brilliant
women
accustomed
to
deference
even
from
such
people
to
be
sneered
at
outfaced
shamed
shoved
aside
by
a
man
in
a
stained
hickory
shirt
and
patched
overalls
and
that
man
his
brother
he
lay
down
on
the
bright
grass
with
the
sheep
all
around
him
and
writhed
and
groaned
with
the
agony
and
despair
of
it
and
worst
of
all
underneath
it
was
a
consciousness
that
grant
was
right
in
distrusting
him
he
had
neglected
him
he
had
said
i
guess
getting
along
all
right
he
had
put
them
behind
him
when
the
invitation
to
spend
summer
on
the
mediterranean
or
in
the
adirondacks
came
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
he
groaned
the
sheep
nibbled
the
grass
near
him
the
jays
called
pertly
shame
shame
a
quail
piped
somewhere
on
the
hillside
and
the
brook
sung
a
soft
soothing
melody
that
took
away
at
last
the
sharp
edge
of
his
pain
and
he
sat
up
and
gazed
down
the
valley
bright
with
the
sun
and
apparently
filled
with
happy
and
prosperous
people
suddenly
a
thought
seized
him
he
stood
up
so
suddenly
that
the
sheep
fled
in
affright
he
leaped
the
brook
crossed
the
flat
and
began
searching
in
the
bushes
on
the
hillside
hurrah
he
said
with
a
smile
he
had
found
an
old
road
which
he
used
to
travel
when
a
boy
a
road
that
skirted
the
edge
of
the
valley
now
grown
up
to
brush
but
still
passable
for
footmen
as
he
ran
lightly
along
down
the
beautiful
path
under
oaks
and
hickories
past
masses
of
under
hanging
grapevines
through
clumps
of
splendid
bushes
loaded
with
great
sticky
rough
green
burs
his
heart
threw
off
part
of
its
load
how
it
all
came
back
to
him
how
many
days
when
the
autumn
sun
burned
the
frost
of
the
bushes
had
he
gathered
here
with
his
boy
and
girl
friends
hugh
and
shelley
mcturg
rome
sawyer
orrin
mcilvaine
and
the
rest
what
had
become
of
them
all
how
he
had
forgotten
them
this
thought
stopped
him
again
and
he
fell
into
a
deep
muse
leaning
against
an
oak
tree
and
gazing
into
the
vast
fleckless
space
above
the
thrilling
inscrutable
mystery
of
life
fell
upon
him
like
a
blinding
light
why
was
he
living
in
the
crush
and
thunder
and
mental
unrest
of
a
great
city
while
his
companions
seemingly
his
equals
in
powers
were
milking
cows
making
butter
and
growing
corn
and
wheat
in
the
silence
and
drear
monotony
of
the
farm
his
boyish
sweethearts
their
names
came
back
to
his
ear
now
with
a
dull
sweet
sound
as
of
faint
bells
he
saw
their
faces
their
pink
sunbonnets
tipped
back
upon
their
necks
their
brown
ankles
flying
with
the
swift
action
of
the
scurrying
partridge
his
eyes
softened
he
took
off
his
hat
the
sound
of
the
wind
and
the
leaves
moved
him
almost
to
tears
a
woodpecker
gave
a
shrill
sustained
cry
ki
ki
ki
and
he
started
from
his
revery
the
dapples
of
the
sun
and
shade
falling
upon
his
lithe
figure
as
he
hurried
on
down
the
path
he
came
at
last
to
a
field
of
corn
that
ran
to
the
very
wall
of
a
large
house
the
sight
of
which
made
his
breathing
quicker
it
was
the
place
where
he
was
born
the
mystery
of
his
life
began
there
in
the
branches
of
those
poplar
and
hickory
trees
he
had
swung
and
sung
in
the
rushing
breeze
fearless
as
a
squirrel
here
was
the
brook
where
like
a
larger
kildee
he
with
grant
had
waded
after
crawfish
or
had
stolen
upon
some
wary
trout
pole
in
hand
seeing
someone
in
the
garden
he
went
down
along
the
through
the
rustling
ranks
of
green
leaves
an
old
woman
was
picking
berries
a
squat
and
shapeless
figure
he
called
cheerily
morgen
she
said
looking
up
at
him
with
a
startled
and
very
red
face
she
was
german
in
every
line
of
her
body
ich
bin
herr
mclane
he
said
after
a
pause
so
she
replied
with
a
questioning
inflection
yah
ich
bin
herr
grant
bruder
ach
so
she
said
with
a
downward
inflection
ich
no
spick
inglish
no
spick
inglis
ich
bin
durstig
he
said
leaving
her
pans
she
went
with
him
to
the
house
which
was
what
he
really
wanted
to
see
ich
bin
hier
geboren
ach
so
she
recognized
the
little
bit
of
sentiment
and
said
some
sentences
in
german
whose
general
meaning
was
sympathy
she
took
him
to
the
cool
cellar
where
the
spring
had
been
trained
to
run
into
a
tank
containing
pans
of
cream
and
milk
she
gave
him
a
cool
draught
from
a
large
tin
cup
and
at
his
request
went
with
him
upstairs
the
house
was
the
same
but
somehow
seemed
cold
and
empty
it
was
clean
and
sweet
but
it
showed
so
little
evidence
of
being
lived
in
the
old
part
which
was
built
of
logs
was
used
as
best
room
and
modelled
after
the
best
rooms
of
the
neighboring
yankee
homes
only
it
was
emptier
without
the
cabinet
organ
and
the
and
the
chromos
the
old
fireplace
was
bricked
up
and
plastered
the
fireplace
beside
which
in
the
days
he
had
lain
on
winter
nights
to
hear
his
uncles
tell
tales
of
hunting
or
to
hear
them
play
the
violin
great
dreaming
giants
that
they
were
the
old
woman
went
out
and
left
him
sitting
there
the
centre
of
a
swarm
of
memories
coming
and
going
like
so
many
ghostly
birds
and
butterflies
a
curious
heartache
and
listlessness
a
nerveless
mood
came
on
him
what
was
it
worth
anyhow
success
struggle
strife
trampling
on
some
one
else
his
play
crowding
out
some
other
poor
fellow
hope
the
hawk
eats
the
partridge
the
partridge
eats
the
flies
and
bugs
the
bugs
eat
each
other
and
the
hawk
when
he
in
his
turn
is
shot
by
man
so
in
the
world
of
business
the
life
of
one
man
seemed
to
him
to
be
drawn
from
the
life
of
another
man
each
success
to
spring
from
other
failures
he
was
like
a
man
from
whom
all
motives
had
been
withdrawn
he
was
sick
sick
to
the
heart
oh
to
be
a
boy
again
an
ignorant
baby
pleased
with
a
block
and
string
with
no
knowledge
and
no
care
of
the
great
unknown
to
lay
his
head
again
on
his
mother
bosom
and
rest
to
watch
the
flames
on
the
hearth
why
not
was
not
that
the
very
thing
to
do
to
buy
back
the
old
farm
it
would
cripple
him
a
little
for
the
next
season
but
he
could
do
it
think
of
it
to
see
his
mother
back
in
the
old
home
with
the
fireplace
restored
the
old
furniture
in
the
sitting
room
around
her
and
fine
new
things
in
the
parlor
his
spirits
rose
again
grant
could
stand
out
when
he
brought
to
him
a
deed
of
the
farm
surely
his
debt
would
be
cancelled
when
he
had
seen
them
all
back
in
the
wide
old
kitchen
he
began
to
plan
and
to
dream
he
went
to
the
windows
and
looked
out
on
the
yard
to
see
how
much
it
had
changed
he
build
a
new
barn
and
buy
them
a
new
carriage
his
heart
glowed
again
and
his
lips
softened
into
their
usual
feminine
grace
lips
a
little
full
and
falling
easily
into
curves
the
old
german
woman
came
in
at
length
bringing
some
cakes
and
a
bowl
of
milk
smiling
broadly
and
hospitably
as
she
waddled
forward
ach
goot
he
said
smacking
his
lips
over
the
pleasant
draught
wo
ist
ihre
goot
mann
he
inquired
ready
for
business
iii
when
grant
came
in
at
noon
mclane
met
him
at
the
door
with
a
tender
smile
on
her
face
where
howard
grant
i
do
know
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
implied
i
do
care
the
dim
eyes
clouded
with
quick
tears
ai
you
seen
him
not
since
nine
where
do
you
think
he
is
i
tell
yeh
i
do
know
he
take
care
of
himself
do
worry
he
flung
off
his
hat
and
plunged
into
the
his
shirt
was
wet
with
sweat
and
covered
with
dust
of
the
hay
and
fragments
of
leaves
he
splashed
his
burning
face
with
the
water
paying
no
further
attention
to
his
mother
she
spoke
again
very
gently
in
reproof
grant
why
do
you
stand
out
against
howard
so
i
do
stand
out
against
him
he
replied
harshly
pausing
with
the
towel
in
his
hands
his
eyes
were
hard
and
piercing
but
if
he
expects
me
to
gush
over
his
coming
back
he
fooled
that
all
he
left
us
to
paddle
our
own
canoe
all
this
while
and
so
far
as
i
concerned
he
can
leave
us
alone
hereafter
he
looked
out
for
his
precious
hide
mighty
well
and
now
he
comes
back
here
to
play
big
gun
and
pat
us
on
the
head
i
do
propose
to
let
him
come
that
over
me
mclane
knew
too
well
the
temper
of
her
son
to
say
any
more
but
she
inquired
about
howard
of
the
old
hired
man
he
went
off
down
the
valley
he
grant
had
s
words
and
he
pulled
out
down
toward
the
old
farm
that
the
last
i
see
of
laura
took
howard
part
at
the
table
pity
you
ca
be
decent
she
said
brutally
direct
as
usual
you
treat
howard
as
if
he
was
a
a
i
do
know
what
will
you
let
me
alone
no
i
wo
if
you
think
i
going
to
set
by
an
agree
to
your
bullyraggin
him
you
mistaken
it
a
shame
you
mad
succeeded
and
you
hai
he
ai
to
blame
for
his
brains
if
you
and
i
had
any
we
succeeded
too
it
ai
our
fault
and
it
his
so
what
the
use
a
look
came
into
grant
face
which
the
wife
knew
meant
bitter
and
terrible
silence
he
ate
his
dinner
without
another
word
it
was
beginning
to
cloud
up
a
thin
whitish
vapor
which
meant
rain
was
dimming
the
sky
and
grant
forced
his
hands
to
their
utmost
during
the
afternoon
in
order
to
get
most
of
the
down
hay
in
before
the
rain
came
he
was
pitching
from
the
load
into
the
barn
when
howard
came
by
just
before
one
it
was
windless
there
the
sun
fell
through
the
white
mist
with
undiminished
fury
and
the
fragrant
hay
sent
up
a
breath
that
was
hot
as
an
grant
was
a
powerful
man
and
there
was
something
majestic
in
his
action
as
he
rolled
the
huge
flakes
of
hay
through
the
door
the
sweat
poured
from
his
face
like
rain
and
he
was
forced
to
draw
his
drenched
sleeve
across
his
face
to
clear
away
the
blinding
sweat
that
poured
into
his
eyes
howard
stood
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
remembering
how
often
he
had
worked
there
in
that
his
muscles
quivering
cold
chills
running
over
his
flesh
red
shadows
dancing
before
his
eyes
his
mother
met
him
at
the
door
anxiously
but
smiled
as
she
saw
his
pleasant
face
and
cheerful
eyes
you
a
little
late
m
son
howard
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
sitting
with
his
mother
on
the
porch
or
under
the
trees
lying
sprawled
out
like
a
boy
resting
at
times
with
sweet
forgetfulness
of
the
whole
world
but
feeling
a
dull
pain
whenever
he
remembered
the
stern
silent
man
pitching
hay
in
the
hot
sun
on
the
torrid
side
of
the
barn
his
mother
did
not
say
anything
about
the
quarrel
she
feared
to
reopen
it
she
talked
mainly
of
old
times
in
a
gentle
monotone
of
reminiscence
while
he
listened
looking
up
into
her
patient
face
the
heat
slowly
lessened
as
the
sun
sank
down
toward
the
dun
clouds
rising
like
a
more
distant
and
majestic
line
of
mountains
beyond
the
western
hills
the
sound
of
came
irregularly
to
the
ear
and
the
voices
and
sounds
of
the
had
a
jocund
pleasant
sound
to
the
ear
of
the
he
was
very
tender
everything
conspired
to
make
him
simple
direct
and
honest
mother
if
you
only
forgive
me
for
staying
away
so
long
i
surely
come
to
see
you
every
summer
she
had
nothing
to
forgive
she
was
so
glad
to
have
him
there
at
her
feet
her
great
handsome
successful
boy
she
could
only
love
him
and
enjoy
him
every
moment
of
the
precious
days
if
grant
would
only
reconcile
himself
to
howard
that
was
the
great
thorn
in
her
flesh
howard
told
her
how
he
had
succeeded
it
was
luck
mother
first
i
met
cook
and
he
introduced
me
to
jake
saulsman
of
chicago
jake
asked
me
to
go
to
new
york
with
him
and
i
do
know
why
took
a
fancy
to
me
some
way
he
introduced
me
to
a
lot
of
the
fellows
in
new
york
and
they
all
helped
me
along
i
did
nothing
to
merit
it
everybody
helps
me
anybody
can
succeed
in
that
way
the
doting
mother
thought
it
not
at
all
strange
that
they
all
helped
him
at
the
supper
table
grant
was
gloomily
silent
ignoring
howard
completely
mclane
sat
and
grieved
silently
not
daring
to
say
a
word
in
protest
laura
and
the
baby
tried
to
amuse
howard
and
under
cover
of
their
talk
the
meal
was
eaten
the
boy
fascinated
howard
he
sawed
wood
with
a
rapidity
and
uninterruptedness
which
gave
alarm
he
had
the
air
of
coaling
up
for
a
long
voyage
at
that
age
howard
thought
i
must
have
gripped
my
knife
in
my
right
hand
so
and
poured
my
tea
into
my
saucer
so
i
must
have
buttered
and
bit
into
a
huge
slice
of
bread
just
so
and
chewed
at
it
with
a
smacking
sound
in
just
that
way
i
must
have
gone
to
the
length
of
scooping
up
honey
with
my
the
sky
was
magically
beautiful
over
all
this
squalor
and
toil
and
bitterness
from
five
till
seven
a
moving
hour
again
the
falling
sun
streamed
in
broad
banners
across
the
valleys
again
the
blue
mist
lay
far
down
the
coolly
over
the
river
the
cattle
called
from
the
hills
in
the
moistening
sonorous
air
the
bells
came
in
a
pleasant
tangle
of
sound
the
air
pulsed
with
the
deepening
chorus
of
katydids
and
other
nocturnal
singers
sweet
and
deep
as
the
very
springs
of
his
life
was
all
this
to
the
soul
of
the
elder
brother
but
in
the
midst
of
it
the
younger
man
in
clothes
and
great
boots
that
chafed
his
feet
went
out
to
milk
the
cows
on
whose
legs
the
flies
and
mosquitoes
swarmed
bloated
with
blood
to
sit
by
the
hot
side
of
the
cow
and
be
lashed
with
her
tail
as
she
tried
frantically
to
keep
the
savage
insects
from
eating
her
raw
the
poet
who
writes
of
milking
the
cows
does
it
from
the
hammock
looking
on
howard
soliloquized
as
he
watched
the
old
man
lewis
racing
around
the
filthy
yard
after
one
of
the
young
heifers
that
had
kicked
over
the
pail
in
her
agony
with
the
flies
and
was
unwilling
to
stand
still
and
be
eaten
alive
so
so
you
beast
roared
the
old
man
as
he
finally
cornered
the
shrinking
nearly
frantic
creature
do
you
want
to
look
at
the
garden
asked
mclane
of
howard
and
they
went
out
among
the
vegetables
and
berries
the
bees
were
coming
home
heavily
laden
and
crawling
slowly
into
the
hives
the
level
red
light
streamed
through
the
trees
blazed
along
the
grass
and
lighted
a
few
flowers
into
red
and
gold
flame
it
was
beautiful
and
howard
looked
at
it
through
his
eyes
as
the
painters
do
and
turned
away
with
a
sigh
at
the
sound
of
blows
where
the
wet
and
grimy
men
were
assailing
the
frantic
cows
there
wesley
with
your
trunk
mclane
said
recalling
him
to
himself
wesley
helped
him
carry
the
trunk
in
and
waved
off
thanks
oh
that
all
right
he
said
and
howard
knew
the
western
man
too
well
to
press
the
matter
of
pay
as
he
went
in
an
hour
later
and
stood
by
the
trunk
the
dull
ache
came
back
into
his
heart
how
he
had
failed
it
seemed
like
a
bitter
mockery
now
to
show
his
gifts
grant
had
come
in
from
his
work
and
with
his
feet
released
from
his
chafing
boots
in
his
wet
shirt
and
overalls
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
reading
a
newspaper
which
he
held
close
to
a
small
kerosene
lamp
he
paid
no
attention
to
any
one
his
attitude
curiously
like
his
father
was
perfectly
definite
to
howard
it
meant
that
from
that
time
forward
there
were
to
be
no
words
of
any
sort
between
them
it
meant
that
they
were
no
longer
brothers
not
even
acquaintances
how
inexorable
that
face
thought
howard
he
turned
sick
with
disgust
and
despair
and
would
have
closed
his
trunk
without
showing
any
of
the
presents
only
for
the
childish
expectancy
of
his
mother
and
laura
here
something
for
you
mother
he
said
assuming
a
cheerful
voice
as
he
took
a
fold
of
fine
silk
from
the
trunk
and
held
it
up
all
the
way
from
paris
he
laid
it
on
his
mother
lap
and
stooped
and
kissed
her
and
then
turned
hastily
away
to
hide
the
tears
that
came
to
his
own
eyes
as
he
saw
her
keen
pleasure
and
here
a
parasol
for
laura
i
do
know
how
i
came
to
have
that
in
here
and
here
general
grant
autobiography
for
his
namesake
he
said
with
an
effort
at
carelessness
and
waited
to
hear
grant
rise
grant
wo
you
come
in
asked
his
mother
quiveringly
grant
did
not
reply
nor
move
laura
took
the
handsome
volumes
out
and
laid
them
beside
him
on
the
table
he
simply
pushed
them
to
one
side
and
went
on
with
his
reading
again
that
horrible
anger
swept
hot
as
flame
over
howard
he
could
have
cursed
him
his
hands
shook
as
he
handed
out
other
presents
to
his
mother
and
laura
and
the
baby
he
tried
to
joke
i
did
know
how
old
the
baby
was
so
she
have
to
grow
to
some
of
these
things
but
the
pleasure
was
all
gone
for
him
and
for
the
rest
his
heart
swelled
almost
to
a
feeling
of
pain
as
he
looked
at
his
mother
there
she
sat
with
the
presents
in
her
lap
the
shining
silk
came
too
late
for
her
it
threw
into
appalling
relief
her
age
her
poverty
her
frame
my
god
he
almost
cried
aloud
how
little
it
would
have
taken
to
lighten
her
life
upon
this
moment
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
endure
no
more
came
the
smooth
voice
of
william
mcturg
hello
folkses
hello
uncle
bill
come
in
that
what
we
came
for
laughed
a
woman
voice
is
that
you
rose
asked
laura
it
me
rose
replied
the
laughing
girl
as
she
bounced
into
the
room
and
greeted
everybody
in
a
breathless
sort
of
way
you
do
mean
little
rosy
big
rosy
now
said
william
howard
looked
at
the
handsome
girl
and
smiled
saying
in
a
nasal
sort
of
tone
wal
wal
rosy
how
you
growed
since
i
saw
yeh
oh
look
at
all
this
purple
and
fine
linen
am
i
left
out
rose
was
a
large
girl
of
or
thereabouts
and
was
called
an
old
maid
she
radiated
from
every
line
of
her
buxom
self
her
black
eyes
were
full
of
drollery
and
she
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
howard
at
once
she
had
been
a
teacher
but
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
assuming
a
homely
directness
of
speech
of
course
they
talked
about
old
friends
where
rachel
howard
inquired
her
smile
faded
away
shellie
married
orrin
mcilvaine
they
out
in
dakota
havin
a
hard
row
of
stumps
there
was
a
little
silence
and
tommy
gone
west
most
all
the
boys
have
gone
west
that
the
reason

old
maid

marry
these
days
are
you
married
not
yet
his
eyes
lighted
up
again
in
a
humorous
way
not
yet
that
good
that
the
way
old
maids
all
talk
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
no
young
fellow
comes
prowling
around
oh
a
young
dutchman
or
norwegian
once
in
a
while
nobody
that
counts
fact
is
we
getting
like
boston

women

when
you
consider
that

more
particular

year

outlook
is
well

certainly
is

a
failure

of

he
explained
as
he
saw
her
smile
in
the
defensive
way
a
fleshy
girl
has
alert
to
ward
off
a
joke
they
were
in
the
midst
of
talk
howard
telling
one
of
his
funny
stories
when
a
wagon
clattered
up
to
the
door
and
merry
voices
called
loudly

at
last
those
that
had
rocked
vigorously
to
and
fro
to
hide
their
embarrassment
they
all
talked
in
loud
voices
howard
felt
nervous
under
this
furtive
scrutiny
he
wished
that
his
clothes
did
look
so
confoundedly
dressy
why
did
he
have
sense
enough
to
go
and
buy
a
suit
of
diagonals
for
everyday
wear
rose
was
the
life
of
the
party
her
tongue
rattled
on
in
the
most
delightful
way
it
all
rose
and
bill
doin
mcilvaine
explained
they
told
us
to
come
over
and
pick
up
anybody
we
see
on
the
road
so
we
did
howard
winced
a
little
at
her
familiarity
of
tone
he
could
help
it
for
the
life
of
him
well
i
wanted
to
come
because
i
going
away
next
week
and
i
wanted
to
see
how
he
act
at
a
again
rose
explained
married
i
said
mcilvaine
abruptly
no
not
yet
good
land
why
y
mus
be
how
must
mam
not
to
have
a
young
to
call
granny
the
men
came
clumping
in
talking
about
haying
and
horses
some
of
the
older
ones
howard
knew
and
greeted
but
the
younger
ones
were
mainly
too
much
changed
they
were
all
very
ill
at
ease
some
of
them
were
in
compromise
dress
something
lying
between
working
rig
and
sunday
dress
most
of
them
had
on
clean
shirts
and
paper
collars
and
wore
their
sunday
coats
thick
woollen
garments
over
rough
trousers
most
of
them
crossed
their
legs
at
once
and
all
of
them
sought
the
wall
and
leaned
back
perilously
upon
the
hind
legs
of
their
chairs
eyeing
howard
slowly
for
the
first
few
minutes
the
presents
were
the
subjects
of
conversation
the
women
especially
spent
a
good
deal
of
talk
upon
them
howard
found
himself
forced
to
taking
the
initiative
so
he
inquired
about
the
crops
and
about
the
farms
i
see
you
do
plough
the
hills
as
we
used
to
and
reap
what
a
job
it
used
to
be
it
makes
the
hills
more
beautiful
to
have
them
covered
with
smooth
grass
and
cattle
there
was
only
dead
silence
to
this
touching
upon
the
idea
of
beauty
i
it
pays
reasonably
not
enough
to
kill
said
one
of
the
younger
men
you
see
that
by
the
houses
we
live
in
that
is
most
of
us
a
few
that
came
in
early
an
got
land
cheap
like
mcilvaine
here
he
got
a
lift
that
the
rest
of
us
ca
get
i
a
myself
said
one
young
fellow
blushing
and
looking
away
as
howard
turned
and
said
cheerily
so
i
the
rest
semed
to
feel
that
this
was
a
tabooed
subject
a
subject
to
be
talked
out
of
doors
where
a
man
could
prance
about
and
yell
and
do
justice
to
it
grant
sat
silently
in
the
kitchen
doorway
not
saying
a
word
not
looking
at
his
brother
well
i
do
never
use
hot
vinegar
for
mine
mcilvaine
was
heard
to
say
i
jest
use
hot
water
and
i
rinse
out
good
and
set
up
in
the
sun
i
do
know
but
what
hot
vinegar
would
be
more
cleansin
rose
had
the
younger
folks
in
a
giggle
with
a
droll
telling
of
a
joke
on
herself
how
d
y
stop
from
laffin
i
let
laugh
oh
my
school
is
a
disgrace
so
one
director
says
but
i
like
to
see
children
laugh
it
broadens
their
cheeks
yes
that
all
laura
was
showing
the
baby
sunday
clothes
goodness
peter
how
do
you
find
time
to
do
so
much
i
take
time
howard
being
the
lion
of
the
evening
tried
his
best
to
be
agreeable
he
kept
near
his
mother
because
it
afforded
her
so
much
pride
and
satisfaction
and
because
he
was
obliged
to
keep
away
from
grant
who
had
begun
to
talk
to
the
men
howard
talked
mainly
about
their
affairs
but
still
was
forced
more
and
more
into
talking
of
life
in
the
city
as
he
told
of
the
theatre
and
the
concerts
a
sudden
change
fell
upon
them
they
grew
sober
and
he
felt
deep
down
in
the
hearts
of
these
people
a
melancholy
which
was
expressed
only
illusively
with
little
tones
or
sighs
their
gayety
was
fitful
they
were
hungry
for
the
world
for
life
these
young
people
discontented
and
yet
hardly
daring
to
acknowledge
it
indeed
few
of
them
could
have
made
definite
statement
of
their
dissatisfaction
the
older
people
felt
it
less
they
practically
said
with
a
sigh
of
pathetic
resignation
well
i
do
expect
ever
to
see
these
things
now
a
casual
observer
would
have
said
what
a
pleasant
bucolic
this
little
of
welcome
but
howard
with
his
native
ear
and
eye
had
no
such
pleasing
illusion
he
knew
too
well
these
suggestions
of
despair
and
bitterness
he
knew
that
like
the
smile
of
the
slave
this
cheerfulness
was
deep
down
was
another
unsatisfied
ego
seeing
grant
talking
with
a
group
of
men
over
by
the
kitchen
door
he
crossed
over
slowly
and
stood
listening
wesley
cosgrove
a
tall
young
fellow
with
a
grave
almost
tragic
face
was
saying
of
course
i
ai
who
is
a
man
that
satisfied
to
live
as
we
do
is
a
fool
the
worst
of
it
is
said
grant
without
seeing
howard
a
man
get
out
of
it
during
his
lifetime
and
i
do
know
that
he
have
any
chance
in
the
next
the
speculator
be
there
ahead
of
us
the
rest
laughed
but
grant
went
on
grimly
ten
years
ago
wess
here
could
have
got
land
in
dakota
pretty
easy
but
now
it
about
all
a
feller
life
worth
to
try
it
i
tell
you
things
seem
shuttin
down
on
us
fellers
plenty
o
land
to
rent
suggested
some
one
yes
in
terms
that
skin
a
man
alive
more
than
that
farmin
ai
so
free
a
life
as
it
used
to
be
this
and
makes
a
nigger
of
a
man
binds
him
right
down
to
the
grindstone
and
he
gets
nothin
out
of
it
that
what
rubs
it
in
he
simply
wallers
around
in
the
manure
for
somebody
else
i
like
to
know
what
a
man
life
is
worth
who
lives
as
we
do
how
much
higher
is
it
than
the
lives
the
niggers
used
to
live
these
brutally
bald
words
made
howard
thrill
with
emotion
like
the
reading
of
some
great
tragic
poem
a
silence
fell
on
the
group
that
the
god
truth
grant
said
young
cosgrove
after
a
pause
a
man
like
me
is
helpless
grant
was
saying
just
like
a
fly
in
a
pan
of
molasses
there
no
escape
for
him
the
more
he
tears
around
the
more
liable
he
is
to
rip
his
legs
off
what
can
he
do
nothin
the
men
listened
in
silence
oh
come
do
talk
politics
all
night
cried
rose
breaking
in
come
let
have
a
dance
where
that
fiddle
fiddle
cried
howard
glad
of
a
chance
to
laugh
well
now
bring
out
that
fiddle
is
it
william
yes
pap
old
fiddle
o
gosh
he
do
want
to
hear
me

protested
william
he
heard
s
many
fiddlers
fiddlers
i
heard
a
thousand
violinists
but
not
fiddlers
come
give
us
john
william
took
the
fiddle
in
his
and
crooked
hands
and
began
tuning
it
the
group
at
the
kitchen
door
turned
to
listen
their
faces
lighting
up
a
little
rose
tried
to
get
a
set
on
the
floor
oh
good
land
said
some
we
all
tuckered
out
what
makes
you
so
anxious
she
wants
a
chance
to
dance
with
the
new
yorker
that
it
exactly
rose
admitted
wal
if
you
churned
and
mopped
and
cooked
for
hayin
hands
as
i
have
you
would
be
so
full
o
nonsense
oh
bother
life
short
come
quick
get
bettie
out
come
wess
never
mind
your
by
incredible
exertion
she
got
a
set
on
the
floor
and
william
got
the
fiddle
in
tune
howard
looked
across
at
wesley
and
thought
the
change
in
him
splendidly
dramatic
his
face
had
lighted
with
a
timid
deprecating
boyish
smile
rose
could
do
anything
with
him
william
played
some
of
the
old
tunes
that
had
a
thousand
associated
memories
in
howard
brain
memories
of
of
and
of
clear
cold
winter
nights
as
he
danced
his
eyes
filled
with
a
tender
light
he
came
closer
to
them
all
than
he
had
been
able
to
do
before
grant
had
gone
out
into
the
kitchen
after
two
or
three
sets
had
been
danced
the
company
took
seats
and
could
not
be
stirred
again
so
laura
and
rose
disappeared
for
a
few
moments
and
returning
served
strawberries
and
cream
which
laura
said
she
just
happened
to
have
in
the
house
and
then
william
played
again
his
fingers
now
grown
more
supple
brought
out
clearer
firmer
tones
as
he
played
silence
fell
on
these
people
the
magic
of
music
sobered
every
face
the
women
looked
older
and
more
careworn
the
men
slouched
sullenly
in
their
chairs
or
leaned
back
against
the
wall
it
seemed
to
howard
as
if
the
spirit
of
tragedy
had
entered
this
house
music
had
always
been
william
unconscious
expression
of
his
unsatisfied
desires
he
was
never
melancholy
except
when
he
played
then
his
eyes
grew
sombre
his
drooping
face
full
of
shadows
he
played
on
slowly
softly
wailing
scotch
tunes
and
mournful
irish
love
songs
he
seemed
to
find
in
these
melodies
and
especially
in
a
wild
sweet
negro
song
some
expression
for
his
indefinable
inner
melancholy
he
played
on
forgetful
of
everybody
his
long
beard
sweeping
the
violin
his
hands
marvellously
obedient
to
his
will
at
last
he
stopped
looked
up
with
a
faint
apologetic
smile
and
said
with
a
sigh
well
folkses
time
to
go
home
the
going
was
quiet
not
much
laughing
howard
stood
at
the
door
and
said
to
them
all
his
heart
very
tender
come
and
see
us
they
said
i
will
he
replied
cordially
i
try
and
get
around
to
see
everybody
and
talk
over
old
times
before
i
go
back
after
the
wagons
had
driven
out
of
the
yard
howard
turned
and
put
his
arm
about
his
mother
neck
tired
a
little
well
now
good
night
i
going
for
a
little
stroll
his
brain
was
too
active
to
sleep
he
kissed
his
mother
and
went
out
into
the
road
his
hat
in
his
hand
the
cool
moist
wind
on
his
hair
it
was
very
dark
the
stars
being
partly
hidden
by
a
thin
vapor
on
each
side
the
hills
rose
every
line
familiar
as
the
face
of
an
old
friend
a
whippoorwill
called
occasionally
from
the
hillside
and
the
spasmodic
jangle
of
a
bell
now
and
then
told
of
some
cow
battle
with
the
mosquitoes
as
he
walked
he
pondered
upon
the
tragedy
he
had
rediscovered
in
these
people
lives
out
here
under
the
inexorable
spaces
of
the
sky
a
deep
distaste
of
his
own
life
took
possession
of
him
he
felt
like
giving
it
all
up
he
thought
of
the
infinite
tragedy
of
these
lives
which
the
world
loves
to
call
peaceful
and
pastoral
his
mind
went
out
in
the
aim
to
help
them
what
could
he
do
to
make
life
better
worth
living
nothing
they
must
live
and
die
practically
as
he
saw
them
and
yet
he
knew
this
was
a
mood
and
that
in
a
few
hours
the
love
and
the
habit
of
life
would
come
back
upon
him
and
upon
them
that
he
would
go
back
to
the
city
in
a
few
days
that
these
people
would
live
on
and
make
the
best
of
it
i
make
the
best
of
it
he
said
at
last
and
his
thought
came
back
to
his
mother
and
grant
iv
the
next
day
was
a
rainy
day
not
a
shower
but
a
steady
rain
an
unusual
thing
in
midsummer
in
the
west
a
cold
dismal
day
in
the
fireless
colorless
farmhouses
it
came
to
howard
in
that
peculiar
reaction
which
surely
comes
during
a
visit
of
this
character
when
thought
is
a
weariness
when
the
visitor
longs
for
his
own
familiar
walls
and
pictures
and
books
and
longs
to
meet
his
friends
feeling
at
the
same
time
the
tragedy
of
life
which
makes
friends
nearer
and
more
congenial
than
howard
ate
his
breakfast
alone
save
baby
and
laura
its
mother
going
about
the
room
baby
and
mother
alike
insisted
on
feeding
him
to
death
already
dyspeptic
pangs
were
setting
in
now
ai
there
something
more
i
can
good
heavens
no
he
cried
in
dismay
i
likely
to
die
of
dyspepsia
now
this
honey
and
milk
and
these
delicious
hot
biscuits
i
afraid
it
ai
much
like
the
breakfasts
you
have
in
the
city
well
no
it
ai
he
confessed
but
this
is
the
kind
a
man
needs
when
he
lives
in
the
open
air
she
sat
down
opposite
him
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
her
chin
in
her
palm
her
eyes
full
of
shadows
i
like
to
go
to
a
city
once
i
never
saw
a
town
la
crosse
i
never
seen
a
play
but
i
read
of
in
the
magazines
it
must
be
wonderful
they
say
they
have
wharves
and
real
ships
coming
up
to
the
wharf
and
people
getting
off
and
on
how
do
they
do
it
oh
that
too
long
a
story
to
tell
it
a
lot
of
machinery
and
paint
and
canvas
if
i
told
you
how
it
was
done
you
would
enjoy
it
so
well
when
you
come
on
and
see
it
do
you
ever
expect
to
see
me
in
new
york
why
yes
why
not
i
expect
grant
to
come
on
and
bring
you
all
some
day
especially
tonikins
here
tonikins
you
hear
sir
i
expect
you
to
come
on
you
forf
birfday
sure
he
tried
thus
to
stop
the
gloomy
confidence
i
hate
she
went
on
with
a
bitter
inflection
it
nothing
but
fret
fret
and
work
the
whole
time
never
going
any
place
never
seeing
anybody
but
a
lot
of
neighbors
just
as
big
fools
as
you
are
i
spend
my
time
fighting
flies
and
washing
dishes
and
churning
i
sick
of
it
all
howard
was
silent
what
could
he
say
to
such
an
indictment
the
ceiling
swarmed
with
flies
which
the
cold
rain
had
driven
to
seek
the
warmth
of
the
kitchen
the
gray
rain
was
falling
with
a
dreary
sound
outside
and
down
the
kitchen
an
occasional
drop
fell
on
the
stove
with
a
hissing
angry
sound
the
young
wife
went
on
with
a
deeper
note
i
lived
in
la
crosse
two
years
going
to
school
and
i
know
a
little
something
of
what
city
life
is
if
i
was
a
man
i
bet
i
would
wear
my
life
out
on
a
farm
as
grant
does
i
get
away
and
i
do
something
i
would
care
what
but
i
get
away
there
was
a
certain
volcanic
energy
back
of
all
the
woman
said
that
made
howard
feel
she
would
make
the
attempt
she
did
not
know
that
the
struggle
for
a
place
to
stand
on
this
planet
was
eating
the
heart
and
soul
out
of
men
and
women
in
the
city
just
as
in
the
country
but
he
could
say
nothing
if
he
had
said
in
conventional
phrase
sitting
there
in
his
soft
clothing
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
all
the
woman
could
justly
have
thrown
the
in
his
face
he
could
say
nothing
i
was
a
fool
for
ever
marrying
she
went
on
while
the
baby
pushed
a
chair
across
the
room
i
made
a
decent
living
teaching
i
was
free
to
come
and
go
my
money
was
my
own
now
i
tied
right
down
to
a
churn
or
a
i
never
have
a
cent
of
my
own
he
growlin
half
the
time
and
there
no
chance
of
his
ever
being
different
she
stopped
with
a
bitter
sob
in
her
throat
she
forgot
she
was
talking
to
her
husband
brother
she
was
conscious
only
of
his
sympathy
as
if
a
great
black
cloud
had
settled
down
upon
him
howard
felt
it
all
the
horror
hopelessness
imminent
tragedy
of
it
all
the
glory
of
nature
the
bounty
and
splendor
of
the
sky
only
made
it
the
more
benumbing
he
thought
of
a
sentence
millet
once
wrote
i
see
very
well
the
aureole
of
the
dandelions
and
the
sun
also
far
down
there
behind
the
hills
flinging
his
glory
upon
the
clouds
but
not
alone
that
i
see
in
the
plains
the
smoke
of
the
tired
horses
at
the
plough
or
on
a
spot
of
ground
a
man
trying
to
raise
himself
upright
for
a
moment
to
breathe
the
tragedy
is
surrounded
by
glories
that
is
no
invention
of
mine
howard
arose
abruptly
and
went
back
to
his
little
bedroom
where
he
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
till
he
was
calm
enough
to
write
and
then
he
sat
down
and
poured
it
all
out
to
dearest
margaret
and
his
first
sentence
was
this
if
it
were
not
for
you
just
to
let
you
know
the
mood
i
in
if
it
were
not
for
you
and
i
had
the
world
in
my
hands
i
crush
it
like
a
evil
so
predominates
suffering
is
so
universal
and
persistent
happiness
so
fleeting
and
so
infrequent
he
wrote
on
for
two
hours
and
by
the
time
he
had
sealed
and
directed
several
letters
he
felt
calmer
but
still
terribly
depressed
the
rain
was
still
falling
sweeping
down
from
the
hills
wreathing
the
wooded
peaks
with
a
gray
garment
of
mist
and
filling
the
valley
with
a
whitish
cloud
it
fell
around
the
house
drearily
it
ran
down
into
the
tubs
placed
to
catch
it
dripped
from
the
mossy
pump
and
drummed
on
the
upturned
and
upon
the
brown
and
yellow
beehives
under
the
maple
trees
the
chickens
seemed
depressed
but
the
irrepressible
bluejay
screamed
amid
it
all
with
the
same
insolent
spirit
his
plumage
untarnished
by
the
wet
the
barnyard
showed
a
horrible
mixture
of
mud
and
mire
through
which
howard
caught
glimpses
of
the
men
slumping
to
and
fro
without
more
additional
protection
than
a
ragged
coat
and
a
shapeless
felt
hat
in
the
sitting
room
where
his
mother
sat
sewing
there
was
not
an
ornament
save
the
etching
he
had
brought
the
clock
stood
on
a
small
shell
its
dial
so
much
defaced
that
one
could
not
tell
the
time
of
day
and
when
it
struck
it
was
with
noticeably
disproportionate
deliberation
as
if
it
wished
to
correct
any
mistake
into
which
the
family
might
have
fallen
by
reason
of
its
illegible
dial
the
paper
on
the
walls
showed
the
first
concession
of
the
puritans
to
the
spirit
of
beauty
and
was
made
up
of
a
heterogeneous
mixture
of
flowers
of
shapes
and
colors
arranged
in
four
different
ways
along
the
wall
there
were
no
books
no
music
and
only
a
few
newspapers
in
sight
a
bare
blank
cold
shelter
from
the
rain
not
a
home
nothing
cozy
nothing
a
grim
and
horrible
shed
what
are
they
doing
it
ca
be
they
at
work
such
a
day
as
this
howard
said
standing
at
the
window
they
find
plenty
to
do
even
on
rainy
days
answered
his
mother
grant
always
has
some
job
to
set
the
men
at
it
the
only
way
to
live
i
go
out
and
see
them
he
turned
suddenly
mother
why
should
grant
treat
me
so
have
i
deserved
it
mclane
sighed
in
pathetic
hopelessness
i
do
know
howard
worried
about
grant
he
gets
more
an
more
an
gloomy
every
day
seems
if
he
go
crazy
he
do
care
how
he
looks
any
more
dress
up
on
sunday
days
an
days
he
go
aroun
not
sayin
a
word
i
was
in
hopes
you
could
help
him
howard
my
coming
seems
to
have
had
an
opposite
effect
he
has
spoken
a
word
to
me
except
when
he
had
to
since
i
came
mother
what
do
you
say
to
going
home
with
me
to
new
york
oh
i
could
do
that
she
cried
in
terror
i
could
live
in
a
big
city
never
there
speaks
the
truly
rural
mind
smiled
howard
at
his
mother
who
was
looking
up
at
him
through
her
glasses
with
a
pathetic
forlornness
which
sobered
him
again
why
mother
you
could
live
in
orange
new
jersey
or
out
in
connecticut
and
be
just
as
lonesome
as
you
are
here
you
would
need
to
live
in
the
city
i
could
see
you
then
every
day
or
two
well
i
could
leave
grant
an
the
baby
anyway
she
replied
not
realizing
how
one
could
live
in
new
jersey
and
do
business
daily
in
new
york
well
then
how
would
you
like
to
go
back
into
the
old
house
the
patient
hands
fell
to
the
lap
the
dim
eyes
fixed
in
searching
glance
on
his
face
there
was
a
wistful
cry
in
the
voice
oh
howard
do
you
mean
he
came
and
sat
down
by
her
and
put
his
arm
about
her
and
hugged
her
hard
i
mean
you
dear
good
patient
old
mother
i
going
to
buy
back
the
old
farm
and
put
you
in
it
there
was
no
refuge
for
her
now
except
in
tears
and
she
put
up
her
thin
trembling
old
hands
about
his
neck
and
cried
in
that
easy
placid
restful
way
age
has
howard
could
not
speak
his
throat
ached
with
remorse
and
pity
he
saw
his
forgetfulness
of
them
all
once
more
without
relief
the
black
thing
it
was
there
there
mother
do
cry
he
said
torn
with
anguish
by
her
tears
measured
by
man
tearlessness
her
weeping
seemed
terrible
to
him
i
did
realize
how
things
were
going
here
it
was
all
my
fault
or
at
least
most
of
it
grant
letter
did
reach
me
i
thought
you
were
still
on
the
old
farm
but
no
matter
it
all
over
now
come
do
cry
any
more
mother
dear
i
going
to
take
care
of
you
now
it
had
been
years
since
the
poor
lonely
woman
had
felt
such
warmth
of
love
her
sons
had
been
like
her
husband
chary
of
expressing
their
affection
and
like
most
puritan
families
there
was
little
of
caressing
among
them
sitting
there
with
the
rain
on
the
roof
and
driving
through
the
trees
they
planned
getting
back
into
the
old
house
howard
plan
seemed
to
her
full
of
splendor
and
audacity
she
began
to
understand
his
power
and
wealth
now
as
he
put
it
into
concrete
form
before
her
i
wish
i
could
eat
thanksgiving
dinner
there
with
you
he
said
at
last
but
it
ca
be
thought
of
however
i
have
you
all
in
there
before
i
go
home
i
going
out
now
and
tell
grant
now
do
worry
any
more
i
going
to
fix
it
all
up
with
him
sure
he
gave
her
a
parting
hug
laura
advised
him
not
to
attempt
to
get
to
the
barn
but
as
he
persisted
in
going
she
hunted
up
an
old
rubber
coat
for
him
you
mire
down
and
spoil
your
shoes
she
said
glancing
at
his
neat
calf
gaiters
darn
the
difference
he
laughed
in
his
old
way
besides
i
got
rubbers
better
go
round
by
the
fence
she
advised
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
pouring
rain
how
wretchedly
familiar
it
all
was
the
miry
with
the
hollow
trampled
out
around
the
the
disconsolate
hens
standing
under
the
wagons
and
sheds
a
pig
wallowing
across
its
sty
and
for
atmosphere
the
desolate
falling
rain
it
was
so
familiar
he
felt
a
pang
of
the
old
rebellious
despair
which
seized
him
on
such
days
in
his
boyhood
catching
up
courage
he
stepped
out
on
the
grass
opened
the
gate
and
entered
the
a
narrow
ribbon
of
turf
ran
around
the
fence
on
which
he
could
walk
by
clinging
with
one
hand
to
the
rough
boards
in
this
way
he
slowly
made
his
way
around
the
periphery
and
came
at
last
to
the
open
without
much
harm
it
was
a
desolate
interior
in
the
open
grant
seated
upon
a
was
mending
a
harness
the
old
man
was
holding
the
trace
in
his
hard
brown
hands
the
boy
was
lying
on
a
wisp
of
hay
it
was
a
small
barn
and
poor
at
that
there
was
a
bad
smell
as
of
dead
rats
about
it
and
the
rain
fell
through
the
shingles
here
and
there
to
the
right
and
below
the
horses
stood
looking
up
with
their
calm
and
beautiful
eyes
in
which
the
whole
scene
was
idealized
grant
looked
up
an
instant
and
then
went
on
with
his
work
did
yeh
wade
through
grinned
lewis
exposing
his
broken
teeth
no
i
kinder
circumambiated
the
pond
he
sat
down
on
the
little
near
grant
your
barn
is
good
deal
like
that
in
arkansaw
traveller
needs
a
new
roof
grant
his
voice
had
a
pleasant
sound
full
of
the
tenderness
of
the
scene
through
which
he
had
just
been
in
fact
you
need
a
new
barn
i
need
a
good
many
things

shortly
how

on
this
farm

years

fall

able
to
think

his
head
back

god
sake

mad
again

at

to
quarrel
i
did
suppose

come
to
see

i
admit
that
all
i
can
say
in
excuse
is
that
since
i
got
to
managing
plays
i
kept
looking
ahead
to
making
a
big
hit
and
getting
a
barrel
of
money
just
as
the
old
miners
used
to
hope
and
watch
besides
you
do
understand
how
much
pressure
there
is
on
me
a
hundred
different
people
pulling
and
hauling
to
have
me
go
here
or
go
there
or
do
this
or
do
that
when
it
is
yachting
it
canoeing
or
he
stopped
his
heart
gave
a
painful
throb
and
a
shiver
ran
through
him
again
he
saw
his
life
so
rich
so
bright
so
free
set
over
against
the
routine
life
in
the
little
low
kitchen
the
barren
sitting
room
and
this
still
more
horrible
barn
why
should
his
brother
sit
there
in
wet
and
grimy
clothing
mending
a
broken
trace
while
he
enjoyed
all
the
light
and
civilization
of
the
age
he
looked
at
grant
fine
figure
his
great
strong
face
recalled
his
deep
stern
masterful
voice
am
i
so
much
superior
to
him

circumstances
made
me
and
destroyed
him

but

howard
said
pacing
about
his
hands
in
his
grant
had
stopped
work
and
was
gloomily
looking
out
of
the
door
at
a
pig
nosing
in
the
mud
for
stray
grains
of
wheat
at
the
granary
door
the
old
man
and
the
boy
quietly
withdrew
good
god
i
see
it
all
now
howard
burst
out
in
an
impassioned
tone
i
went
ahead
with
my
education
got
my
start
in
life
then
father
died
and
you
took
up
his
burdens
circumstances
made
me
and
crushed
you
that
all
there
is
about
that
luck
made
me
and
cheated
you
it
right
his
voice
faltered
both
men
were
now
oblivious
of
their
companions
and
of
the
scene
both
were
thinking
of
the
days
when
they
both
planned
great
things
in
the
way
of
an
education
two
ambitious
dreamful
boys
i
used
to
think
of
you
grant
when
i
pulled
out
monday
morning
in
my
best
suit
cost
fifteen
dollars
in
those
days
he
smiled
a
little
at
the
recollection
while
you
in
overalls
and
an
old
was
going
out
into
the
field
to
plough
or
husk
corn
in
the
mud
it
made
me
feel
uneasy
but
as
i
said
i
kept
saying
to
myself
turn
come
in
a
year
or
two
but
it
did
his
voice
choked
he
walked
to
the
door
stood
a
moment
came
back
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
tell
you
old
man
many
a
time
in
my
down
to
the
city
when
i
thought
of
the
jolly
times
i
was
having
my
heart
hurt
me
but
i
said
no
use
to
cry
better
go
on
and
do
the
best
you
can
and
then
help
them
afterward
there
only
be
one
more
miserable
member
of
the
family
if
you
stay
at
home
besides
it
seemed
right
to
me
to
have
first
chance
but
i
never
thought
you
be
shut
off
grant
if
i
had
i
never
would
have
gone
on
come
old
man
i
want
you
to
believe
that
his
voice
was
very
tender
now
and
almost
humble
i
do
know
as
i
blame
you
for
that
said
grant
slowly
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
called
howard
by
his
boyish
nickname
his
voice
was
softer
too
and
higher
in
key
but
he
looked
steadily
away
i
went
to
new
york
people
liked
my
work
i
was
very
successful
grant
more
successful
than
you
realize
i
could
have
helped
you
at
any
time
there
no
use
lying
about
it
and
i
ought
to
have
done
it
but
some
way
it
no
excuse
i
do
mean
it
for
an
excuse
only
an
explanation
some
way
i
got
in
with
the
boys
i
do
mean
i
was
a
drinker
and
all
that
but
i
bought
pictures
and
kept
a
horse
and
a
yacht
and
of
course
i
had
to
pay
my
share
of
all
expeditions
and
oh
what
the
use
he
broke
off
turned
and
threw
his
open
palms
out
toward
his
brother
as
if
throwing
aside
the
last
attempt
at
an
excuse
i
did
neglect
you
and
it
a
damned
shame
and
i
ask
your
forgiveness
come
old
man
he
held
out
his
hand
and
grant
slowly
approached
and
took
it
there
was
a
little
silence
then
howard
went
on
his
voice
trembling
the
tears
on
his
face
i
want
you
to
let
me
help
you
old
man
that
the
way
to
forgive
me
will
you
yes
if
you
can
help
me
howard
squeezed
his
hand
that
all
right
old
man
now
you
make
me
a
boy
again
course
i
can
help
you
i
got
ten
i
do
mean
that
how
grant
voice
was
very
grave
money
give
me
a
chance
now
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
life
ai
worth
very
much
to
me
i
too
old
to
take
a
new
start
i
a
dead
failure
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
life
a
failure
for
per
cent
of
us
you
ca
help
me
now
it
too
late
the
two
men
stood
there
face
to
face
hands
clasped
the
one
handsome
in
his
neat
suit
the
other
tragic
sombre
in
his
softened
mood
his
large
long
rugged
scotch
face
bronzed
with
sun
and
scarred
with
wrinkles
that
had
histories
like
on
a
veteran
the
record
of
his
battles
among
the
but
the
road
sometimes
passes
a
rich
meadow
where
the
songs
of
larks
and
bobolinks
and
blackbirds
are
tangled
i
rob
held
up
his
hands
from
which
the
dough
depended
in
ragged
strings
biscuits
he
said
with
an
elaborate
working
of
his
jaws
intended
to
convey
the
idea
that
they
were
going
to
be
specially
delicious
seagraves
laughed
but
did
not
enter
the
shanty
door
how
do
you
like
baching
it
oh
do
mention
it
entreated
rob
mauling
the
dough
again
come
in
an
sit
down
what
in
thunder
y
standin
out
there
for
oh
i
rather
be
where
i
can
see
the
prairie
great
weather
how
goes
breaking
a
leette
dry
now
but
the
bulls
pull
the
plough
through
two
acres
a
day
how
things
in
boomtown
oh
same
old
grind
judge
still
lyin
still
at
it
major
mullens
still
swearin
to
it
you
hit
it
like
a
mallet
railroad
schemes
are
thicker
you
got
grit
rob
i
do
have
anything
but
crackers
and
sardines
over
to
my
shanty
and
here
you
are
making
i
have
t
do
it
could
break
if
i
did
you
editors
take
things
easy
lay
around
on
the
prairie
and
watch
the
plovers
and
medderlarks
but
we
settlers
have
got
to
work
leaving
rob
to
sputter
over
his
cooking
seagraves
took
his
slow
way
off
down
toward
the
oxen
grazing
in
a
little
hollow
the
scene
was
characteristically
wonderfully
beautiful
it
was
about
five
in
a
day
in
late
june
and
the
level
plain
was
green
and
yellow
and
infinite
in
reach
as
a
sea
the
lowering
sun
was
casting
over
its
distant
swells
a
faint
impalpable
mist
through
which
the
breaking
teams
on
the
neighboring
claims
ploughed
noiselessly
as
figures
in
a
dream
the
whistle
of
gophers
the
faint
wailing
fluttering
cry
of
the
falling
plover
the
whir
of
the
or
the
quack
of
a
lonely
duck
came
through
the
shimmering
air
the
infrequent
whistle
piercingly
sweet
broke
from
the
longer
grass
in
the
swales
nearby
no
other
climate
sky
plain
could
produce
the
same
unnamable
weird
charm
no
tree
to
wave
no
grass
to
rustle
scarcely
a
sound
of
domestic
life
only
the
faint
melancholy
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
short
grass
and
the
voices
of
the
wild
things
of
the
prairie
seagraves
an
impressionable
young
man
junior
editor
of
the
boomtown
spike
threw
himself
down
on
the
sod
pulled
his
down
over
his
eyes
and
looked
away
over
the
plain
it
was
the
second
year
of
boomtown
existence
and
seagraves
had
not
yet
grown
restless
under
its
monotony
around
him
the
gophers
played
saucily
teams
were
moving
here
and
there
across
the
sod
with
a
peculiar
noiseless
effortless
motion
that
made
them
seem
as
calm
lazy
and
insubstantial
as
the
mist
through
which
they
made
their
way
even
the
sound
of
passing
wagons
seemed
a
sort
of
low
chuckle
seagraves
holding
down
a
claim
near
rob
had
come
to
see
his
neighboring
bach
because
feeling
the
need
of
company
but
now
that
he
was
near
enough
to
hear
him
prancing
about
getting
supper
he
was
content
to
lie
alone
on
a
slope
of
the
green
sod
the
silence
of
the
prairie
at
night
was
terrible
many
a
night
as
seagraves
lay
in
his
bunk
against
the
side
of
his
cabin
he
would
strain
his
ear
to
hear
the
slightest
sound
and
be
listening
thus
sometimes
for
minutes
before
the
squeak
of
a
mouse
or
the
step
of
a
passing
fox
came
as
a
relief
to
the
aching
sense
in
the
daytime
however
and
especially
on
a
morning
the
prairie
was
another
thing
the
pigeons
the
larks
the
cranes
the
multitudinous
voices
of
the
and
snipes
and
insects
made
the
air
pulsate
with
sound
a
chorus
that
died
away
into
an
infinite
murmur
of
music
hello
seagraves
yelled
rob
from
the
door
the
biscuit
are
done
seagraves
did
not
speak
only
nodded
his
head
and
slowly
rose
the
faint
clouds
in
the
west
were
getting
a
superb
above
and
a
misty
purple
below
and
the
sun
had
pierced
them
with
lances
of
yellow
light
as
the
air
grew
denser
with
moisture
the
sounds
of
neighboring
life
began
to
reach
the
ear
children
screamed
and
laughed
and
afar
off
a
woman
was
singing
a
lullaby
the
rattle
of
wagons
and
the
voices
of
men
speaking
to
their
teams
multiplied
ducks
in
a
neighboring
lowland
were
quacking
sociably
the
whole
scene
took
hold
upon
seagraves
with
irresistible
power
it
is
american
he
exclaimed
no
other
land
or
time
can
match
this
mellow
air
this
wealth
of
color
much
less
the
strange
social
conditions
of
life
on
this
sunlit
dakota
prairie
rob
though
visibly
affected
by
the
scene
also
could
let
his
biscuit
spoil
or
go
without
proper
attention
say
ai
y
comin
t
grub
he
asked
impatiently
in
a
minute
replied
his
friend
taking
a
last
wistful
look
at
the
scene
i
want
one
more
look
at
the
landscape
landscape
be
blessed
if
you
been
breakin
all
day
come
take
that
stool
an
draw
up
no
i
take
the
not
much
i
know
what
manners
are
if
i
am
a
seagraves
took
the
and
rather
stool
and
drew
up
to
the
table
which
was
a
flat
broad
box
nailed
up
against
the
side
of
the
wall
with
two
strips
of
board
spiked
at
the
outer
corners
for
legs
how
that
a
rob
inquired
proudly
well
you
have
spread
yourself
biscuit
and
canned
peaches
and
sardines
and
cheese
why
this
is
is
prodigal
it
ai
nothin
else
rob
was
from
one
of
the
finest
counties
of
wisconsin
over
toward
milwaukee
he
was
of
german
parentage
a
cheery
young
fellow
a
typical
he
was
always
confident
jovial
and
full
of
plans
for
the
future
he
had
dug
his
own
well
built
his
own
shanty
washed
and
mended
his
own
clothing
he
could
do
anything
and
do
it
well
he
had
a
fine
field
of
wheat
and
was
finishing
the
ploughing
of
his
entire
this
is
what
i
call
settin
under
a
feller
own
vine
an
fig
tree
after
seagraves
compliments
an
i
like
it
i
my
own
boss
no
man
can
say
here
there
to
me
i
get
up
when
i
a
to
an
go
t
bed
when
i
a
min
to
some
drawbacks
i
yes
mice

give
me
a
devilish
lot
o
trouble
they
get
into
my
eat
up
my
cheese
an
fall
into
my
well
but
it
ai
no
use
t
swear
seagraves
quoted
an
old
rhyme
rats
and
the
mice
they
made
such
a
strife
he
had
to
go
to
london
to
buy
him
a
wife
do
blush
i
probed
your
secret
thought
well
to
tell
the
honest
truth
said
rob
a
little
sheepishly
leaning
across
the
table
i
ai
satisfied
with
my
style
o
cookin
good
but
a
little
too
plain
y
know
i
like
a
change
it
ai
much
fun
to
break
all
day
and
then
go
to
work
an
cook
own
supper
no
i
should
say
not
this
fall
i
going
back
to
wisconsin
girls
are
thick
as
huckleberries
back
there
and
i
goin
t
bring
one
back
now
you
hear
me
good
that
the
plan
laughed
seagraves
amused
at
a
certain
timid
and
apprehensive
look
in
his
companion
eye
just
think
what
a
woman
would
do
to
put
this
shanty
in
shape
and
think
how
nice
it
would
be
to
take
her
arm
and
saunter
out
after
supper
and
look
at
the
farm
and
plan
and
lay
out
gardens
and
paths
and
tend
the
chickens
rob
manly
and
nature
had
the
settler
typical
buoyancy
and
hopefulness
as
well
as
a
certain
power
of
analysis
which
enabled
him
now
to
say
the
fact
is
we
fellers
holdin
down
claims
out
here
ai
fools
clear
to
the
rine
we
know
a
couple
o
things
now
i
leave
waupac
county
fun
did
y
ever
see
waupac
well
it
one
the
handsomest
counties
the
sun
ever
shone
on
full
o
lakes
and
rivers
and
groves
of
timber
i
miss
all
out
here
and
i
miss
the
boys
girls
but
they
no
chance
there
a
feller
land
that
was
good
was
so
blamed
high
you
could
touch
it
with
a
pole
from
a
balloon
rent
was
high
if
you
wanted
t
rent
an
so
a
feller
like
me
had
t
get
out
an
now
i
out
here
i
goin
t
make
the
most
of
it
another
thing
he
went
on
after
a
pause
we
fellers
workin
out
back
there
got
more
more
like
hands
an
less
like
human
beings
y
know
waupac
is
a
kind
of
a
summer
resort
and
the
people
that
use
t
come
in
summers
looked
down
on
us
cusses
in
the
fields
an
shops
i
stand
it
by
god
he
said
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
rage
quite
unusual
i
rather
live
on
an
iceberg
and
claw
crabs
a
livin
than
have
some
feller
passin
me
on
the
road
an
callin
me
seagraves
knew
what
he
meant
but
listened
in
astonishment
at
his
outburst
i
consider
myself
a
sight
better
any
man
who
lives
on
somebody
else
hard
work
i
never
had
a
cent
i
did
earn
with
them
hands
he
held
them
up
and
broke
into
a
grin
beauties
ai
they
but
they
never
wore
gloves
that
some
other
poor
cuss
earned
seagraves
thought
them
grand
hands
worthy
to
grasp
the
hand
of
any
man
or
woman
living
well
so
i
come
west
just
like
a
thousand
other
fellers
to
get
a
start
where
the
cussed
european
aristocracy
had
got
a
holt
on
the
people
i
like
it
here
course
i
like
the
lakes
an
meadows
of
waupac
better
but
i
my
own
boss
as
i
say
and
i
goin
to
stay
my
own
boss
if
i
have
to
live
on
crackers
an
wheat
coffee
to
do
it
that
the
kind
of
a
i
am
in
the
pause
which
followed
seagraves
plunged
deep
into
thought
by
rob
words
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
this
working
farmer
had
voiced
the
modern
idea
it
was
an
absolute
overturn
of
all
the
ideas
of
nobility
and
special
privilege
born
of
the
feudal
past
i
like
to
use
your
idea
for
an
editorial
rob
he
said
my
ideas
exclaimed
the
astounded
host
pausing
in
the
act
of
filling
his
pipe
my
ideas
why
i
did
know
i
had
any
well
you
given
me
some
anyhow
seagraves
felt
that
it
was
a
wild
grand
upstirring
of
the
modern
democrat
against
the
aristocrat
against
the
idea
of
caste
and
the
privilege
of
living
on
the
labor
of
others
this
atom
of
humanity
how
infinitesimal
this
drop
in
the
ocean
of
humanity
was
feeling
the
nameless
longing
of
expanding
personality
he
had
declared
rebellion
against
laws
that
were
survivals
of
hate
and
prejudice
he
had
exposed
also
the
native
spring
of
the
emigrant
by
uttering
the
feeling
that
it
is
better
to
be
an
equal
among
peasants
than
a
servant
before
nobles
so
i
have
good
reasons
liking
the
country
rob
resumed
in
a
quiet
way
the
soil
is
rich
the
climate
good
so
far
an
if
i
have
a
couple
o
decent
crops
you
see
a
neat
upright
goin
up
here
with
a
porch
and
a
and
you
still
be
living
here
alone
frying
leathery
slapjacks
chopping
and
bacon
i
think
i
see
myself
drawled
rob
goin
around
all
summer
the
same
shirt
without
washin
an
wipin
on
the
same
towel
four
straight
weeks
an
wearin
holes
in
my
socks
an
eatin
musty
mouldy
bacon
an
canned
boston
beans
the
rest
o
my
endurin
days
oh
yes
i
guess
not
he
rose
well
see
y
later
must
go
water
my
bulls
as
he
went
off
down
the
slope
seagraves
smiled
to
hear
him
sing
i
wish
that
some
girl
would
pity
on
me
take
and
extricate
me
from
the
mess
i
in
the
angel
how
i
bless
her
if
this
her
home
she
make
in
my
little
old
sod
shanty
on
the
plain
the
boys
nearly
fell
off
their
chairs
in
the
western
house
dining
room
a
few
days
later
when
rob
came
in
to
supper
with
a
collar
and
necktie
as
the
finishing
touch
of
a
remarkable
outfit
hit
him
somebody
it
a
clean
collar
he
started
congress
he
going
to
get
married
put
in
seagraves
in
a
tone
that
brought
conviction
what
screamed
jack
adams
and
wilson
in
one
breath
that
man
that
man
replied
seagraves
amazed
at
rob
who
coolly
took
his
seat
squared
his
elbows
pressed
his
collar
down
at
the
back
and
called
for
the
bacon
and
eggs
the
crowd
stared
at
him
in
a
dead
silence
where
he
going
to
do
it
asked
jack
adams
where
he
going
to
find
a
girl
ask
him
said
seagraves
i

rob

exclaimed
jack
impressively
that
simply
lets

man

a
cheek

to
succeed
interrupted
seagraves
that
what

proprietor
of
the
house

henry
said
the
elegant
wilson
looking
gravely
about

his
spectacles
i
commend
the
courage
and
the
resolution
of
rodemaker
i
pray
the
lady
may
not
him
for

of
the
burning

shakespeare
said
adams
at
a
venture
wilson
turned
to
rob

in
adversity

winking
at

wilson
i

rodemaker

and
tall
the
rest
roared
at
rob
astonishment
and
confusion
the
absurdity
of
it
grew
and
they
went
into
spasms
of
laughter
but
wilson
remained
impassive
not
the
twitching
of
a
muscle
betraying
that
he
saw
anything
to
laugh
at
in
the
proposition
whiting
and
the
came
in
wondering
at
the
merriment
rob
began
to
get
uneasy
what
is
it
what
is
it
said
whiting
a
jolly
little
matron
rivers
put
the
case
rob
on
his
way
back
to
wisconsin
t
get
married
and
wilson
has
offered
to
bet
him
that
his
wife
will
be
a
blonde
and
tall
and
rob
dassent
bet
and
they
roared
again
why
the
idea
the
man
crazy
said
whiting
the
crowd
looked
at
each
other
this
was
hint
enough
they
sobered
nodding
at
each
other
commiseratingly
aha
i
see
i
understand
it
the
heat
and
the
boston
beans
let
up
on
him
wilson
do
badger
a
poor
irresponsible
fellow
i
thought
something
was
wrong
when
i
saw
the
collar
oh
keep

up
said
rob
a
little
nettled
by
their
evident
intention
to
have
fun
with
him
soothe
him
him
said
wilson
do
be
harsh
rob
rose
from
the
table
go
to
thunder
you
fellows
make
me
tired
the
fit
is
on
him
again
he
rose
disgustedly
and
went
out
they
followed
him
in
single
file
the
rest
of
the
town
caught
on
frank

at

rob
went
into
the
store
to
buy
some
tobacco
they
all
followed
and
perched
like
crows
on
the
counters
till
he
went
out
then
they
followed
him
as
before
they
watched

his

they
witnessed

up
a

while

stood
around
patiently
bearing
the
jokes
of
the
crowd
we
lookin
rather
seedy
now
while
holdin
down
our
claims
and
our
vittles
are
not
always
of
the
best
and
the
mice
play
slyly
round
us
as
we
lay
down
to
sleep
in
our
little
old
tarred
shanties
on
the
claim
yet
we
rather
like
the
novelty
of
livin
in

way

the
bill
of
fare
is
often
rather
tame

the

drew
up
at
length
to
the
immense
relief
of
rob
whose
stoical
resignation
was
beginning
to
weaken

he
yelled
to
the
crowd
as
he
plunged
into
the
car
thinking
he
was
rid
of
them
at
last
he
was
mistaken
their
last
stroke
was
to
follow
him
into
the
car
nodding
pointing
to
their
heads
and
whispering

the

at

platform
to
set
every
person
in

staring
at
the
crazy
man
rob
groaned
and
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
an
action
which
confirmed
his
tormentors
words
and
made
several
ladies
click
their
tongues
in
sympathy
tlck

poor
fellow

said
the
conductor
grinning
his
appreciation
at
the
crowd
and
the

off

follow

and
it
may
pass
the
bend
in
the
river
where
the
water
laughs
eternally
over
its
shallows
a
in
july
is
a
sultry
place
the
soil
is
hot
and
dry
the
wind
comes
across
the
lazily
murmuring
leaves
laden
with
a
warm
sickening
smell
drawn
from
the
rapidly
growing
banners
of
the
corn
the
sun
nearly
vertical
drops
a
flood
of
dazzling
light
upon
the
field
over
which
the
cool
shadows
run
only
to
make
the
heat
seem
the
more
intense
julia
peterson
faint
with
hunger
was
tolling
back
and
forth
between
the
holding
the
handles
of
the
while
her
little
brother
otto
rode
the
steaming
horse
her
heart
was
full
of
bitterness
her
face
flushed
with
heat
and
her
muscles
aching
with
fatigue
the
heat
grew
terrible
the
corn
came
to
her
shoulders
and
not
a
breath
seemed
to
reach
her
while
the
sun
nearing
the
noon
mark
lay
pitilessly
upon
her
shoulders
protected
only
by
a
calico
dress
the
dust
rose
under
her
feet
and
as
she
was
wet
with
perspiration
it
soiled
her
till
with
a
woman
instinctive
cleanliness
she
shuddered
her
head
throbbed
dangerously
what
matter
to
her
that
the
kingbird
pitched
jovially
from
the
maples
to
catch
a
wandering
bluebottle
fly
that
the
robin
was
feeding
its
young
that
the
bobolink
was
singing
all
these
things
if
she
saw
them
only
threw
her
bondage
to
labor
into
greater
relief
across
the
field
in
another
patch
of
corn
she
could
see
her
father
a
big
norwegian
at
work
also
with
a
plough
the
corn
must
be
ploughed
and
so
she
toiled
on
the
tears
dropping
from
the
shadow
of
the
ugly
she
wore
her
shoes
coarse
and
chafed
her
feet
her
hands
large
and
strong
were
browned
or
more
properly
burnt
on
the
backs
by
the
sun
the
horse
harness
as
he
swung
steadily
and
patiently
forward
the
moisture
pouring
from
his
sides
his
nostrils
distended
the
field
bordered
on
a
road
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
ran
a
river
a
broad
clear
shallow
expanse
at
that
point
and
the
eyes
of
the
boy
gazed
longingly
at
the
pond
and
the
cool
shadow
each
time
that
he
turned
at
the
fence
say
jule
i
goin
in
come
ca
i
come
say
he
pleaded
as
they
stopped
at
the
fence
to
let
the
horse
breathe
i
let
you
go
wade
twice
but
that
do
do
any
good
my
legs
is
all
smarty
ol
jack
sweats
so
the
boy
turned
around
on
the
horse
back
and
slid
back
to
his
rump
i
ca
stand
it
he
burst
out
sliding
off
and
darting
under
the
fence
father
ca
see
the
girl
put
her
elbows
on
the
fence
and
watched
her
little
brother
as
he
sped
away
to
the
pool
throwing
off
his
clothes
as
he
ran
whooping
with
uncontrollable
delight
soon
she
could
hear
him
splashing
about
in
the
water
a
short
distance
up
the
stream
and
caught
glimpses
of
his
little
shiny
body
and
happy
face
how
cool
that
water
looked
and
the
shadows
there
by
the
big
basswood
how
that
water
would
cool
her
blistered
feet
an
impulse
seized
her
and
she
squeezed
between
the
rails
of
the
fence
and
stood
in
the
road
looking
up
and
down
to
see
that
the
way
was
clear
it
was
not
a
road
no
one
was
likely
to
come
why
not
she
hurriedly
took
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
how
delicious
the
cool
soft
velvet
of
the
grass
and
sitting
down
on
the
bank
under
the
great
basswood
whose
roots
formed
an
abrupt
bank
she
slid
her
poor
blistered
chafed
feet
into
the
water
her
bare
head
leaned
against
the
huge
and
now
as
she
rested
the
beauty
of
the
scene
came
to
her
over
her
the
wind
moved
the
leaves
a
jay
screamed
far
off
as
if
answering
the
cries
of
the
boy
a
kingfisher
crossed
and
recrossed
the
stream
with
dipping
sweep
of
his
wings
the
river
sang
with
its
lips
to
the
pebbles
the
vast
clouds
went
by
majestically
far
above
the
and
the
snap
and
buzzing
and
ringing
whir
of
july
insects
made
a
ceaseless
slumberous
undertone
of
song
solvent
of
all
else
the
tired
girl
forgot
her
work
she
began
to
dream
this
would
not
last
always
some
one
would
come
to
release
her
from
such
drudgery
this
was
her
constant
tenderest
and
most
secret
dream
he
would
be
a
yankee
not
a
norwegian
the
yankees
did
ask
their
wives
to
work
in
the
field
he
would
have
a
home
perhaps
he
live
in
town
perhaps
a
merchant
and
then
she
thought
of
the
drug
clerk
in
rock
river
who
had
looked
at
her
a
voice
broke
in
on
her
dream
a
fresh
manly
voice
well
by
jinks
if
it
ai
julia
just
the
one
i
wanted
to
see
the
girl
turned
saw
a
young
fellow
in
a
derby
hat
and
a
cutaway
suit
of
diagonals
bod
rodemaker
how
come
she
remembered
her
situation
and
flushed
looked
down
at
the
water
and
remained
perfectly
still
ai
you
goin
to
shake
hands
y
do
seem
very
glad
t
see
me
she
began
to
grow
angry
if
you
had
any
eyes
you
see
rob
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
whistled
turned
away
oh
i
see
excuse
me
do
blame
yeh
a
bit
though
good
weather
corn
he
went
on
looking
up
at
the
trees
corn
seems
to
be
pretty
well
forward
he
continued
in
a
louder
voice
as
he
walked
away
still
gazing
into
the
air
crops
is
looking
in
boomtown
hello

the
boy
grinning
never

replied
rob
leaping
the
fence
by
laying
his
left
hand
on
the
top
rail
get
on
to
that
horse
he
tossed
the
boy
up
on
the
horse
and
hung
his
coat
on
the
fence
i
the
ol
man
makes
her
plough

as

otto
dod

but
it
ai
necessary
in
his
case
he
continued
to
mutter
in
this
way
as
he
went
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
field
as
they
turned
to
come
back
rob
went
up
and
looked
at
the
horse
mouth
gettin
purty
near
of
age
say
who

but
she
goes
off
an
leaves
chk
said
rob
starting
old
jack
across
the
field
it
was
almost
noon
and
jack
moved
reluctantly
he
knew
the
time
of
day
as
well
as
the
boy
he
made
this
round
after
distinct
protest
in
the
meantime
julia
putting
on
her
shoes
and
stockings
went
to
the
fence
and
watched
the
man
shining
white
shirt
as
he
moved
across
the
there
had
never
been
any
special
tenderness
between
them
but
she
had
always
liked
him
they
had
been
at
school
together
she
wondered
why
he
had
come
back
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
wondered
how
long
he
would
stay
how
long
had
he
stood
looking
at
her
she
flushed
again
at
the
thought
of
it
but
he
was
to
blame
it
was
a
public
road
she
might
have
known
better
she
stood
under
a
little
popple
tree
whose
leaves
shook
musically
at
every
zephyr
and
her
eyes
through
lids
roved
over
the
sea
of
glossy
leaves
dappled
here
and
there
by
cloud
shadows
stirred
here
and
there
like
water
by
the
wind
and
out
of
it
all
a
longing
to
be
free
from
such
toil
rose
like
a
breath
filling
her
throat
and
quickening
the
motion
of
her
heart
must
this
go
on
forever
this
life
of
heat
and
dust
and
labor
what
did
it
all
mean
the
girl
laid
her
chin
on
her
strong
red
wrists
and
looked
up
into
the
blue
spaces
between
the
vast
clouds
aerial
mountains
dissolving
in
a
shoreless
azure
sea
how
cool
and
sweet
and
restful
they
looked
if
she
might
only
lie
out
on
the
billowy
sunlit
edge
the
voices
of
the
driver
and
the
ploughman
recalled
her
and
she
fixed
her
eyes
again
upon
the
slowly
nodding
head
of
the
patient
horse
on
the
boy
turned
half
about
on
his
saddle
talking
to
the
man
whose
derby
hat
bobbed
up
and
down
quite
curiously
like
the
horse
head
would
she
ask
him
to
dinner
what
would
her
people
say
phew
it
hot
was
the
greeting
the
young
fellow
gave
as
he
came
up
he
smiled
in
a
frank
boyish
way
as
he
hung
his
hat
on
the
top
of
a
stake
and
looked
up
at
her
d
y
know
i
kind
o
enjoy
gettin
at
it
again
fact
it
ai
no
work
for
a
girl
though
he
added
when
you
get
back
she
asked
the
flush
not
yet
out
of
her
face
rob
was
looking
at
her
thick
fine
hair
and
full
scandinavian
face
rich
as
a
rose
in
color
and
did
not
reply
for
a
few
seconds
she
stood
with
her
hideous
pushed
back
on
her
shoulders
a
kingbird
was
chattering
overhead
oh
a
few
days
ago
how
long
y
goin
t
stay
oh
i
d
know
a
week
mebbe
a
halloo
came
pulsing
across
the
shimmering
air
the
boy
screamed
dinner
and
waved
his
hat
with
an
answering
whoop
then
flopped
off
the
horse
like
a
turtle
off
a
stone
into
water
he
had
the
horse
unhooked
in
an
instant
and
had
flung
his
toes
up
over
the
back
in
act
to
climb
on
when
rob
said
young
feller
wait
a
minute
tired
he
asked
the
girl
with
a
tone
that
was
more
than
kindly
it
was
almost
tender
yes
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
my
shoes
hurt
me
well
here
y
go
he
replied
taking
his
stand
by
the
horse
and
holding
out
his
hand
like
a
step
she
colored
and
smiled
a
little
as
she
lifted
her
foot
into
his
huge
hard
sunburned
hand
he
called
she
gave
a
spring
and
sat
on
the
horse
like
one
at
home
there
rob
had
a
deliciously
unconscious
abstracted
air
he
really
left
her
nothing
to
do
but
enjoy
his
company
while
he
went
ahead
and
did
precisely
as
he
pleased
we
do
raise
much
corn
out
there
an
so
i
kind
o
like
to
see
it
once
more
i
wish
i
did
have
to
see
another
hill
of
corn
as
long
as
i
live
replied
the
girl
bitterly
do
know
as
i
blame
yeh
a
bit
but
all
the
same
i
glad
you
was
working
in
it
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
walked
beside
her
horse
toward
the
house
will
you
stop
to
dinner
she
inquired
bluntly
almost
surlily
it
was
evident
there
were
reasons
why
she
did
mean
to
press
him
to
do
so
you
bet
i
will
he
replied
that
is
if
you
want
i
should
you
know
how
we
live
she
replied
evasively
if
you
can
stand
it
why
she
broke
off
abruptly
yes
he
remembered
how
they
lived
in
that
big
square
dirty
white
frame
house
it
had
been
three
or
four
years
since
he
had
been
in
it
but
the
smell
of
the
cabbage
and
onions
the
penetrating
peculiar
mixture
of
odors
assailed
his
memory
as
something
unforgettable
i
guess
i
stop
he
said
as
she
hesitated
she
said
no
more
but
tried
to
act
as
if
she
were
not
in
any
way
responsible
for
what
came
afterward
i
guess
i
stand
one
meal
what
you
stand
all
the
while
he
added
as
she
left
them
at
the
well
and
went
to
the
house
he
saw
her
limp
painfully
and
the
memory
of
her
face
so
close
to
his
lips
as
he
helped
her
down
from
the
horse
gave
him
pleasure
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
touched
by
its
tired
and
gloomy
look
peterson
came
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen
looking
just
the
same
as
ever
unwieldly
flabby
apparently
wearing
the
same
dress
he
remembered
to
have
seen
her
in
years
before
a
dirty
thing
she
looked
as
shapeless
as
a
sack
of
wool
her
english
was
limited
to
how
de
do
rob
he
washed
at
the
pump
while
the
girl
in
the
attempt
to
be
hospitable
held
the
clean
towel
for
him
you
purty
well
used
up
eh
he
said
to
her
yes
it
awful
hot
out
there
ca
you
lay
off
this
afternoon
it
ai
right
no
he
wo
listen
to
that
well
let
me
take
your
place
no
there
ai
any
use
o
that
peterson
a
brawny
norwegian
came
up
at
this
moment
and
spoke
to
rob
in
a
sullen
gruff
way
hallo
when
yo
gaet
back
he
ai
very
glad
to
see
me
said
rob
winking
at
julia
he
ai
over
with
enthusiasm
but
i
stand
it
for
your
sake
he
added
with
amazing
assurance
but
the
girl
had
turned
away
and
it
was
wasted
at
the
table
he
ate
heartily
of
the
bean
swaagen
which
filled
a
large
wooden
bowl
in
the
centre
of
the
table
and
which
was
ladled
into
smaller
wooden
bowls
at
each
plate
julia
had
tried
hard
to
convert
her
mother
to
yankee
ways
and
had
at
last
given
it
up
in
despair
rob
kept
on
safe
subjects
mainly
asking
questions
about
the
crops
of
peterson
and
when
addressing
the
girl
inquired
of
the
schoolmates
by
skilful
questioning
he
kept
the
subject
of
marriage
uppermost
and
seemingly
was
getting
an
inventory
of
the
girls
not
yet
married
or
engaged
it
was
embarrassing
for
the
girl
she
was
all
too
well
aware
of
the
difference
between
her
home
and
the
home
of
her
schoolmates
and
friends
she
knew
that
it
was
not
pleasant
for
her
yankee
friends
to
come
to
visit
her
when
they
could
not
feel
sure
of
a
welcome
from
the
tireless
silent
and
old
norse
if
indeed
they
could
escape
insult
julia
ate
her
food
mechanically
and
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
she
enjoyed
the
brisk
talk
of
the
young
man
his
eyes
were
upon
her
so
constantly
and
his
smile
so
obviously
addressed
to
her
she
rose
as
soon
as
possible
and
going
outside
took
a
seat
on
a
chair
under
the
trees
in
the
yard
she
was
not
a
coarse
or
dull
girl
in
fact
she
had
developed
so
rapidly
by
contact
with
the
young
people
of
the
neighborhood
that
she
no
longer
found
pleasure
in
her
own
home
she
did
believe
in
keeping
up
the
norwegian
customs
and
her
life
with
her
mother
was
not
one
to
breed
love
or
confidence
she
was
more
like
a
hired
hand
the
love
of
the
mother
for
her
yulyie
was
sincere
though
rough
and
inarticulate
and
it
was
her
jealousy
of
the
young
yankees
that
widened
the
chasm
between
the
girl
and
herself
an
inevitable
result
rob
followed
the
girl
out
into
the
yard
and
threw
himself
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
perfectly
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
this
attitude
was
exceedingly
graceful
and
becoming
to
them
both
he
did
it
because
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
and
the
grass
was
cool
and
easy
there
was
any
other
chair
anyway
do
they
keep
up
the
and
the
sociables
same
as
ever
yes
the
others
go
a
good
but
i
do
we
gettin
such
a
stock
round
us
and
father
thinks
he
needs
me
s
much
i
do
get
out
often
i
gettin
sick
of
it
i
sh
think
y
would
he
replied
his
eyes
on
her
face
i
c
stand
the
churnin
and
housework
but
when
it
comes
t
outdoors
in
the
dirt
an
hot
sun
gettin
all
sunburned
and
chapped
up
it
another
thing
an
then
it
seems
as
if
he
gets
stingier
stingier
every
year
i
ai
had
a
new
dress
in
i
he
says
it
all
nonsense
an
mother
just
about
as
bad
she
do
want
a
new
dress
an
so
she
thinks
i
do
the
girl
was
feeling
the
influence
of
a
sympathetic
listener
and
was
making
up
for
the
long
silence
i
tried
t
go
out
t
work
but
they
wo
let
me
have
t
pay
a
hand
twenty
dollars
a
month
the
work
i
do
an
they
like
cheap
help
but
i
not
goin
t
stand
it
much
longer
i
can
tell
you
that
rob
thought
she
was
very
handsome
as
she
sat
there
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
horizon
while
these
rebellious
thoughts
found
utterance
in
her
quivering
passionate
voice
yulie
kom
haar
roared
the
old
man
from
the
well
a
frown
of
anger
and
pain
came
into
her
face
she
looked
at
rob
that
means
more
work
say
let
me
go
out
in
your
place
come
now
what
the
use
no
it
would
do
no
good
it
ai
s
much
it
every
day
and
yulie
called
peterson
again
with
a
string
of
impatient
norwegian
batter
yo
kom
pooty
hal
quick
well
all
right
only

like
to
rob

she
said
with
a
little
touch
of
feeling
when
d
ye
go
back
i
do
know
i
see
y
again
before
i
go
he
stood
watching
her
slow
painful
pace
till
she
reached
the
well
where
otto
was
standing
with
the
horse
he
stood
watching
them
as
they
moved
out
into
the
road
and
turned
down
toward
the
field
he
felt
that
she
had
sent
him
away
but
still
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
which
was
not
altogether
he
gave
it
up
in
despair
at
last
he
was
not
good
at
analyses
of
this
nature
he
was
used
to
plain
blunt
expressions
there
was
a
subtlety
here
quite
beyond
his
reach
he
sauntered
slowly
off
up
the
road
after
his
talk
with
julia
his
head
was
low
on
his
breast
he
was
thinking
as
one
who
is
about
to
take
a
decided
and
important
step
he
stopped
at
length
and
turning
watched
the
girl
moving
along
in
the
deeps
of
the
corn
hardly
a
leaf
was
stirring
the
untempered
sunlight
fell
in
a
burning
flood
upon
the
field
the
grasshoppers
rose
snapped
buzzed
and
fell
the
locust
uttered
its
dry
cry
the
man
lifted
his
head
it
a
d
n
shame
he
said
beginning
rapidly
to
retrace
his
steps
he
stood
leaning
on
the
fence
awaiting
the
girl
coming
very
much
as
she
had
waited
his
on
the
round
he
had
made
before
dinner
he
grew
impatient
at
the
slow
gait
of
the
horse
and
drummed
on
the
rail
while
he
whistled
then
he
took
off
his
hat
and
dusted
it
nervously
as
the
horse
got
a
little
nearer
he
wiped
his
face
carefully
pushed
his
hat
back
on
his
head
and
climbed
over
the
fence
where
he
stood
with
elbows
on
the
middle
rail
as
the
girl
and
boy
and
horse
came
to
the
end
of
the
furrow
hot
ai
it
he
said
as
she
looked
up
jimminy
peters
it
awful
puffed
the
boy
the
girl
did
not
reply
till
she
swung
the
plough
about
after
the
horse
and
set
it
upright
into
the
next
row
her
powerful
body
had
a
superb
swaying
motion
at
the
waist
as
she
did
this
a
motion
which
affected
rob
vaguely
but
massively
i
thought
you
gone
she
said
gravely
pushing
back
her
bonnet
till
he
could
see
her
face
dewed
with
sweat
and
pink
as
a
rose
she
had
the
high
of
her
race
but
she
had
also
their
exquisite
fairess
of
color
say
otto
asked
rob
alluringly
wan
to
go
swimmin
you
bet
replied
otto
well
i
go
a
round
if
the
boy
dropped
off
the
horse
not
waiting
to
hear
any
more
rob
grinned
but
the
girl
dropped
her
eyes
then
looked
away
got
rid
o
him
mighty
quick
say
julyie
i
hate
like
thunder
t
see
you
out
here
it
ai
right
i
wish
you
i
wish
she
could
not
look
at
him
now
and
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
a
motion
that
was
not
due
to
fatigue
her
moist
hair
matted
around
her
forehead
gave
her
a
boyish
look
rob
nervously
tried
again
tearing
splinters
from
the
fence
say
now
i
tell
yeh
what
i
came
back
here
for
t
git
married
and
if
willin
i
do
it
come
now
whaddy
y
say
what
i
got
t
do
it
she
finally
asked
the
color
flooding
her
face
and
a
faint
smile
coming
to
her
lips
go
ahead
i
ai
got
anything
rob
put
a
splinter
in
his
mouth
and
faced
her
oh
looky
here
now
julyie
you
know
what
i
mean
i
got
a
good
claim
out
near
boomtown
a
rattlin
good
claim
a
shanty
on
it
fourteen
by
sixteen
no
tarred
paper
about
it
and
a
suller
to
keep
butter
in
and
a
hundred
acres
o
wheat
just
about
ready
to
turn
now
i
need
a
wife
here
he
straightened
up
threw
away
the
splinter
and
took
off
his
hat
he
was
a
very
pleasant
figure
as
the
girl
stole
a
look
at
him
his
black
laughing
eyes
were
especially
earnest
just
now
his
voice
had
a
touch
of
pleading
the
popple
tree
over
their
heads
murmured
applause
at
his
eloquence
then
hushed
to
listen
a
cloud
dropped
a
silent
shadow
down
upon
them
and
it
sent
a
little
thrill
of
fear
through
rob
as
if
it
were
an
omen
of
failure
as
the
girl
remained
silent
looking
away
he
began
to
desire
her
more
and
more
as
he
feared
to
lose
her
he
put
his
hat
on
the
post
again
and
took
out
his
her
calico
dress
draped
her
supple
and
powerful
figure
simply
but
naturally
the
stoop
in
her
shoulders
given
by
labor
disappeared
as
she
partly
leaned
upon
the
fence
the
curves
of
her
muscular
arms
showed
through
her
sleeve
it
lonesome
me
out
there
on
that
claim
and
it
ai
no
picnic
you

now
if
you
come
out

good
layout
o
furniture

i
lath
and
plaster
the
house
and
put
a
little
hell
ell
in
the
rear
he
smiled
and
so
did
she
he
felt
encouraged
to
say
an
there
we
be
as
snug
as
y
please
we
close
t
boomtown
an
we
can
go
down
there
to
church
sociables
an
things
and
they
a
jolly
lot
there
the
girl
was
still
silent
but
the
man
simple
enthusiasm
came
to
her
charged
with
passion
and
a
sort
of
romance
such
as
her
hard
life
had
known
little
of
there
was
something
enticing
about
this
trip
to
the
west
what
my
folks
say
she
said
at
last
a
virtual
surrender
but
rob
was
not
acute
enough
to
see
it
he
pressed
on
eagerly
i
do
care
do
you
they
jest
keep
y
ploughin
corn
and
cows
till
the
day
of
judgment

whoopin
old
crop
sure

that
means
sompin
purty
scrumptious
in
furniture
this
fall
come
now
he
approached
her
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
very
much
as
he
would
have
touched
albert
seagraves
or
any
other
comrade
whaddy
y
say
she
neither
started
nor
shrunk
nor
looked
at
him
she
simply
moved
a
step
away
they
never
let
me
go
she
replied
bitterly
i
too
cheap

hand

do
a
man

an
get
no
pay
at
all

have
half
o
all

he
put
in
how
long
you
wait
she
asked
looking
down
at
her
dress
just
two
minutes
he
said
pulling
out
his
watch
it
ai
no
use
wait
the
old
man
be
jest
as
mad
a
week
from
now
as

mused
wavering
calculating
you

of
age
if
you
jest
call
on
old
square
hatfield
with
me
all
right
rob
the
girl
said
turning
and
holding
out
her
hand
that
the
talk
he
exclaimed
seizing
it
and
now
a
kiss
to
bind
the
bargain
as
the
fellah
says
i
guess
we
get
along
without
that
no
we
ca
it
wo
seem
like
an
engagement
without
it
it
ai
goin
to
seem
much
like
one
anyway
she
answered
with
a
sudden
realization
of
how
far
from
her
dreams
of
courtship
this
reality
was
say
now
julyie
that
ai
fair

was
carried
quite
out
of
himself
by
the
time
the
place
and
the
girl
he
had
said
a
very
moving
thing
the
tears
sprang
involuntarily
to
the
girl
eyes
do
you
mean
it
if
y
do
you
may
she
was
trembling
with
emotion
for
the
first
time
the
sincerity
of
the
man
voice
had
gone
deep
he
put
his
arm
around
her
almost
timidly
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
a
great
love
for
her
springing
up
in
his
heart
that
settles
it
he
said
do
cry
julyie
you
never
be
sorry
for
it
do
cry
it
kind
o
hurts
me
to
see
it
he
did
understand
her
feelings
he
was
only
aware
that
she
was
crying
and
tried
in
a
bungling
way
to
soothe
her
but
now
that
she
had
given
way
she
sat
down
in
the
grass
and
wept
bitterly
yulyie
yelled
the
vigilant
old
norwegian
like
a
distant
foghorn
the
girl
sprang
up
the
habit
of
obedience
was
strong
no

right
there
and
i
go

he
said
otto
the
boy
came
scrambling
out
of
the
wood
half
dressed
rob
tossed
him
upon
the
horse
snatched
julia
put
his
own
hat
on
her
head
and
moved
off
down
the
leaving
the
girl
smiling
through
her
tears
as
he
whistled
and
chirped
to
the
horse
farmer
peterson
seeing
the
familiar
above
the
went
back
to
his
work
with
a
sentence
of
norwegian
trailing
after
him
like
the
tail
of
a
kite
something
about
lazy
girls
who
did
earn
the
crust
of
their
bread
etc
rob
was
wild
with
delight
git

said
the
boy
turning
about
and
showing
his
tongue
all
right
begin
to
practise
now
by
not
talkin
to
me
rob
went
over
the
whole
situation
on
his
way
back
and
when
he
got
in
sight
of
the
girl
his
plan
was
made
she
stood
waiting
for
him
with
a
new
look
on
her
face
her
sullenness
had
given
way
to
a
peculiar
eagerness
and
anxiety
to
believe
in
him
she
was
already
living
that
free
life
in
a
wonderful
country
no
more
would
her
stern
father
and
sullen
mother
force
her
to
tasks
which
she
hated
she
be
a
member
of
a
new
firm
she
work
of
course
but
it
would
be
because
she
wanted
to
and
not
because
she
was
forced
to
the
independence
and
the
love
promised
grew
more
and
more
attractive
she
laughed
back
with
a
softer
light
in
her
eyes
when
she
saw
the
smiling
face
of
rob
looking
at
her
from
her
now
you
must
do
any
more
o
this
he
said
you
go
back
to
the
house
an
tell
mother
you
too
lame
to
plough
any
more
and
it
gettin
late
anyhow
he
whispered
quickly
eleven
here
the
girl
heart
leaped
with
fear
i
afraid
not
of
me
are
yeh
no
i
not
afraid
of
you
rob
i
glad
o
that
i
i
want
you
to
like
me
julyie
wo
you
i
try
she
answered
with
a
smile
then
he
said
as
she
moved
away
he
stood
and
watched
her
till
her
tall
figure
was
lost
among
the
drooping
there
was
a
singular
choking
feeling
in
his
throat
the
girl
voice
and
face
had
brought
up
so
many
memories
of
parties
and
picnics
and
excursions
on
holidays
and
at
the
same
time
held
suggestions
of
the
future
he
already
felt
that
it
was
going
to
be
an
unconscionably
long
time
before
eleven
he
saw
her
go
to
the
house
and
then
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
up
the
dusty
road
out
of
the
the
grasshoppers
sprang
buzzing
and
snapping
their
dull
red
wings
butterflies
yellow
and
white
fluttered
around
moist
places
in
the
ditch
and
slender
striped
glided
across
the
stagnant
pools
at
sound
of
footsteps
but
the
mind
of
the
man
was
far
away
on
his
claim
building
a
new
house
with
a
woman
advice
and
presence
it
was
a
windless
night
the
katydids
and
an
occasional
cricket
were
the
only
sounds
rob
could
hear
as
he
stood
beside
his
team
and
strained
his
ear
to
listen
at
long
intervals
a
little
breeze
ran
through
the
corn
like
a
swift
serpent
bringing
to
his
nostrils
the
sappy
smell
of
the
growing
corn
the
horses
stamped
uneasily
as
the
mosquitoes
settled
on
their
shining
limbs
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
but
there
was
no
moon
what
if
she
do
come
he
thought
or
ca
come
i
ca
stand
that
i
go
to
the
old
man
an
say
here
sh
he
listened
again
there
was
a
rustling
in
the
corn
it
was
not
like
the
fitful
movement
of
the
wind
it
was
steady
slower
and
approaching
it
ceased
he
whistled
the
wailing
sweet
cry
of
the
then
a
figure
came
out
into
the
road
a
woman
julia
he
took
her
in
his
arms
as
she
came
panting
up
to
him
rob
julyie
a
few
words
the
dull
tread
of
swift
horses
the
rising
of
a
silent
train
of
dust
and
then
the
wind
wandered
in
the
growing
corn
the
dust
fell
a
dog
barked
down
the
road
and
the
katydids
sang
to
the
liquid
contralto
of
the
river
in
its
shallows
the
return
of
a
private
on
the
road
leading
to
god
country
and
wife
and
babies
i
the
nearer
the
train
drew
toward
la
crosse
the
soberer
the
little
group
of
vets
became
on
the
long
way
from
new
orleans
they
had
beguiled
tedium
with
jokes
and
friendly
chaff
or
with
planning
with
elaborate
detail
what
they
were
going
to
do
now
after
the
war
a
long
journey
slowly
irregularly
yet
persistently
pushing
northward
when
they
entered
on
wisconsin
territory
they
gave
a
cheer
and
another
when
they
reached
madison
but
after
that
they
sank
into
a
dumb
expectancy
comrades
dropped
off
at
one
or
two
points
beyond
until
there
were
only
four
or
five
left
who
were
bound
for
la
crosse
county
three
of
them
were
gaunt
and
brown
the
fourth
was
gaunt
and
pale
with
signs
of
fever
and
ague
upon
him
one
had
a
great
scar
down
his
temple
one
limped
and
they
all
had
unnaturally
large
bright
eyes
showing
emaciation
there
were
no
bands
greeting
them
at
the
stations
no
banks
of
gayly
dressed
ladies
waving
handkerchiefs
and
shouting
bravo
as
they
came
in
on
the
caboose
of
a
freight
train
into
the
towns
that
had
cheered
and
blared
at
them
on
their
way
to
war
as
they
looked
out
or
stepped
upon
the
platform
for
a
moment
while
the
train
stood
at
the
station
the
loafers
looked
at
them
indifferently
their
blue
coats
dusty
and
grimy
were
too
familiar
now
to
excite
notice
much
less
a
friendly
word
they
were
the
last
of
the
army
to
return
and
the
loafers
were
surfeited
with
such
sights
the
train
jogged
forward
so
slowly
that
it
seemed
likely
to
be
midnight
before
they
should
reach
la
crosse
the
little
squad
grumbled
and
swore
but
it
was
no
use
the
train
would
not
hurry
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
nearly
two
when
the
engine
whistled
down
brakes
all
of
the
group
were
farmers
living
in
districts
several
miles
out
of
the
town
and
all
were
poor
now
boys
said
private
smith
he
of
the
fever
and
ague

are
landed
in
la
crosse
in
the
night

stay
somewhere

and

of
the
other

these

think

a
deputation
of
citizens
waitin
to
us
to
a
hotel
eh
said
another
his
sarcasm
was
too
obvious
to
require
an
answer
smith
went
on
then
at
daybreak
we
start
for
home
at
least
i
will
well
i
be
dummed
if
i
take
two
dollars
out
o
my
hide
one
of
the
younger
men
said
i
goin
to
a
hotel
ef
i
do
never
lay
up
a
cent
that
do
you
said
smith
but
if
you
had
a
wife
an
three
young
uns
dependin
on
yeh
which
i
ai
thank
the
lord
and
do
intend
havin
while
the
court
knows
itself
the
station
was
deserted
chill
and
dark
as
they
came
into
it
at
exactly
a
quarter
to
two
in
the
morning
lit
by
the
oil
lamps
that
flared
a
dull
red
light
over
the
dingy
benches
the
waiting
room
was
not
an
inviting
place
the
younger
man
went
off
to
look
up
a
hotel
while
the
rest
remained
and
prepared
to
camp
down
on
the
floor
and
benches
smith
was
attended
to
tenderly
by
the
other
men
who
spread
their
blankets
on
the
bench
for
him
and
by
robbing
themselves
made
quite
a
comfortable
bed
though
the
narrowness
of
the
bench
made
his
sleeping
precarious
it
was
chill
though
august
and
the
two
men
sitting
with
bowed
heads
grew
stiff
with
cold
and
weariness
and
were
forced
to
rise
now
and
again
and
walk
about
to
warm
their
stiffened
limbs
it
did
not
occur
to
them
probably
to
contrast
their
coming
home
with
their
going
forth
or
with
the
coming
home
of
the
generals
colonels
or
even
captains
but
to
private
smith
at
any
rate
there
came
a
sickness
at
heart
almost
deadly
as
he
lay
there
on
his
hard
bed
and
went
over
his
situation
in
the
deep
of
the
night
lying
on
a
board
in
the
town
where
he
had
enlisted
three
years
ago
all
elation
and
enthusiasm
gone
out
of
him
he
faced
the
fact
that
with
the
joy
of
was
already
mingled
the
bitter
juice
of
care
he
saw
himself
sick
worn
out
taking
up
the
work
on
his
farm
the
inevitable
mortgage
standing
ready
with
open
jaw
to
swallow
half
his
earnings
he
had
given
three
years
of
his
life
for
a
mere
pittance
of
pay
and
now
morning
dawned
at
last
slowly
with
a
pale
yellow
dome
of
light
rising
silently
above
the
bluffs
which
stand
like
some
huge
castle
just
east
of
the
city
out
to
the
left
the
great
river
swept
on
its
massive
yet
silent
way
to
the
south
bluejays
called
across
the
water
from
hillside
to
hillside
through
the
clear
beautiful
air
and
hawks
began
to
skim
the
tops
of
the
hills
the
older
men
were
astir
early
but
private
smith
had
fallen
at
last
into
a
sleep
and
they
went
out
without
waking
him
he
lay
on
his
knapsack
his
gaunt
face
turned
toward
the
ceiling
his
hands
clasped
on
his
breast
with
a
curious
pathetic
effect
of
weakness
and
appeal
an
engine
switching
near
woke
him
at
last
and
he
slowly
sat
up
and
stared
about
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
that
the
sun
was
lightening
the
hills
across
the
river
he
rose
and
brushed
his
hair
as
well
as
he
could
folded
his
blankets
up
and
went
out
to
find
his
companions
they
stood
gazing
silently
at
the
river
and
at
the
hills
looks
do
it
they
said
as
he
came
out
that
what
it
does
he
replied
an
it
looks
good
d
see
that
peak
he
pointed
at
a
beautiful
symmetrical
peak
rising
like
a
slightly
truncated
cone
so
high
that
it
seemed
the
very
highest
of
them
all
it
was
touched
by
the
morning
sun
and
it
glowed
like
a
beacon
and
a
light
scarf
of
gray
morning
fog
was
rolling
up
its
shadowed
side
my
farm
just
beyond
that
now
if
i
can
only
ketch
a
ride
we
be
home
by
i
talkin
about

one
of
the
others
i
guess
it
one
more
meal
o
hardtack
me
said
smith
they
foraged
around
and
finally
found
a
restaurant
with
a
sleepy
old
german
behind
the
counter
and
procured
some
coffee
which
they
drank
to
wash
down
their
hardtack
time
come
said
smith
holding
up
a
piece
by
the
corner
when
this
be
a
curiosity
i
hope
to
god

will
i
bet

said
private
smith
wait
a
moment
boys
less
take
suthin
it
on
me
he
led
them
to
the
rusty
tin
dipper
which
hung
on
a
nail
beside
the
wooden
and
they
grinned
and
drank
then
shouldering
their
blankets
and
muskets
which
they
were
takin
home
to
the
boys
they
struck
out
on
their
last
march
they
called
that

one
of
them
but
it
never
went
by
the
road
where
government
jayvy
resides
i
reckon
i
know
coffee
from
peas
they
kept
together
on
the
road
along
the
turnpike
and
up
the
winding
road
by
the
river
which
they
followed
for
some
miles
the
river
was
very
lovely
curving
down
along
its
sandy
beds
pausing
now
and
then
under
broad
basswood
trees
or
running
in
dark
swift
silent
currents
under
tangles
of
wild
grapevines
and
drooping
alders
and
haw
trees
at
one
of
these
lovely
spots
the
three
vets
sat
down
on
the
thick
green
sward
to
rest
on
smith
account
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
as
fresh
and
green
as
in
june
the
jays
called
cheery
greetings
to
them
and
kingfishers
darted
to
and
fro
with
swooping
noiseless
flight
i
tell

boys

interrupted
smith
rising
and
shouldering
his
knapsack
with
considerable
effort
which
he
tried
to
hide
say
smith

and
they
trudged
along
doggedly
in
the
sun
which
was
getting
higher
and
hotter
each
ai
it
queer
there
ai
no
teams

smith
after
a
long

his
voice
choked
at
the
thought
of
it
saunders
the
third
man
hardly
uttered
a
word
but
walked
silently
behind
the
others
he
had
lost
his
wife
the
first
year
he
was
in
the
army
she
died
of
pneumonia
caught
in
the
autumn
rains
while
working
in
the
fields
in
his
place
they
plodded
along
till
at
last
they
came
to
a
parting
of
the
ways
to
the
right
the
road
continued
up
the
main
valley
to
the
left
it
went
over
the
big
ridge
well
boys
began
smith
as
they
grounded
their
muskets
and
looked
away
up
the
valley
here
where
we
shake
hands
we
marched
together
a
good
many
miles
an
now
i
we
done
yes

while

said
saunders
whose
voice
trembled
a
little
too
it
ai
exactly
like
dyin
they
all
found
it
hard
to
look
at
each
other
but
we

cranby

that
ridge

yeh

well
boys
they
shook
hands
good
luck
same
to
you
lem
me
know
how
you
find
things
at
home
he
turned
once
before
they
passed
out
of
sight
and
waved
his
cap
and
they
did
the
same
and
all
yelled
then
all
marched
away
with
their
long
steady
loping
veteran
step
the
solitary
climber
in
blue
walked
on
for
a
time
with
his
mind
filled
with
the
kindness
of
his
comrades
and
musing
upon
the
many
wonderful
days
they
had
had
together
in
camp
and
field
he
thought
of
his
chum
billy
tripp
poor
billy
a
minie
ball
fell
into
his
breast
one
day
fell
wailing
like
a
cat
and
tore
a
great
ragged
hole
in
his
heart
he
looked
forward
to
a
sad
scene
with
mother
and
sweetheart
they
would
want
to
know
all
about
it
he
tried
to
recall
all
that
billy
had
said
and
the
particulars
of
it
but
there
was
little
to
remember
just
that
wild
wailing
sound
high
in
the
air
a
dull
slap
a
short
quick
expulsive
groan
and
the
boy
lay
with
his
face
in
the
dirt
in
the
ploughed
field
they
were
marching
across
that
was
all
but
all
the
scenes
he
had
since
been
through
had
not
dimmed
the
horror
the
terror
of
that
moment
when
his
boy
comrade
fell
with
only
a
breath
between
a
laugh
and
a
poor
handsome
billy
worth
millions
of
dollars
was
his
young
life
these
sombre
recollections
gave
way
at
length
to
more
cheerful
feelings
as
he
began
to
approach
his
home
coolly
the
fields
and
houses
grew
familiar
and
in
one
or
two
he
was
greeted
by
people
seated
in
the
doorway
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
talk
and
pushed
on
steadily
though
he
stopped
and
accepted
a
drink
of
milk
once
at
the
of
a
neighbor
the
sun
was
getting
hot
on
that
slope
and
his
step
grew
slower
in
spite
of
his
iron
resolution
he
sat
down
several
times
to
rest
slowly
he
crawled
up
the
rough
road
which
wound
along
the
hillside
under
great
trees
through
dense
groves
of
jack
oaks
with
far
below
him
on
his
left
hand
and
the
hills
far
above
him
on
his
right
he
crawled
along
like
some
minute
wingless
variety
of
fly
he
ate
some
hardtack
sauced
with
wild
berries
when
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
sat
there
for
some
time
looking
down
into
his
home
coolly
sombre
pathetic
figure
his
wide
round
gray
eyes
gazing
down
into
the
beautiful
valley
seeing
and
not
seeing
the
splendid
sweeping
over
the
western
hills
and
across
the
green
and
yellow
wheat
far
below
his
head
drooped
forward
on
his
palm
his
shoulders
took
on
a
tired
stoop
his
showed
painfully
an
observer
might
have
said
he
is
looking
down
upon
his
own
grave
ii
sunday
comes
in
a
western
wheat
harvest
with
such
sweet
and
sudden
relaxation
to
man
and
beast
that
it
would
be
holy
for
that
reason
if
for
no
other
and
sundays
are
usually
fair
in
as
one
goes
out
into
the
field
in
the
hot
morning
sunshine
with
no
sound
abroad
save
the
crickets
and
the
indescribably
pleasant
silken
rustling
of
the
ripened
grain
the
reaper
and
the
very
sheaves
in
the
stubble
seem
to
be
resting
dreaming
around
the
house
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
the
men
sit
smoking
dozing
or
reading
the
papers
while
the
women
never
resting
move
about
at
the
housework
the
men
eat
on
sundays
about
the
same
as
on
other
days
and
breakfast
is
no
sooner
over
and
out
of
the
way
than
dinner
begins
but
at
the
smith
farm
there
were
no
men
dozing
or
reading
smith
was
alone
with
her
three
children
mary
nine
tommy
six
and
little
ted
just
past
four
her
farm
rented
to
a
neighbor
lay
at
the
head
of
a
coolly
or
narrow
gully
made
at
some
period
by
the
vast
and
angry
floods
of
water
which
gullied
these
tremendous
furrows
in
the
level
prairie
furrows
so
deep
that
undisturbed
portions
of
the
original
level
rose
like
hills
on
either
side
rose
to
quite
considerable
mountains
the
chickens
wakened
her
as
usual
that
sabbath
morning
from
dreams
of
her
absent
husband
from
whom
she
had
not
heard
for
weeks
the
shadows
drifted
over
the
hills
down
the
slopes
across
the
wheat
and
up
the
opposite
wall
in
leisurely
way
as
if
being
sunday
they
could
take
it
easy
also
the
fowls
clustered
about
the
housewife
as
she
went
out
into
the
yard
fuzzy
little
chickens
swarmed
out
from
the
coops
where
their
clucking
and
perpetually
disgruntled
mothers
tramped
about
petulantly
thrusting
their
heads
through
the
spaces
between
the
slats
a
cow
called
in
a
deep
musical
bass
and
a
calf
answered
from
a
little
pen
near
by
and
a
pig
scurried
guiltily
out
of
the
cabbages
seeing
all
this
seeing
the
pig
in
the
cabbages
the
tangle
of
grass
in
the
garden
the
broken
fence
which
she
had
mended
again
and
again
the
little
woman
hardly
more
than
a
girl
sat
down
and
cried
the
bright
sabbath
morning
was
only
a
mockery
without
him
a
few
years
ago
they
had
bought
this
farm
paying
part
mortgaging
the
rest
in
the
usual
way
edward
smith
was
a
man
of
terrible
energy
he
worked
nights
and
sundays
as
the
saying
goes
to
clear
the
farm
of
its
brush
and
of
its
insatiate
mortgage
in
the
midst
of
his
herculean
struggle
came
the
call
for
volunteers
and
with
the
grim
and
unselfish
devotion
to
his
country
which
made
the
eagle
brigade
able
to
whip
its
weight
in
he
threw
down
his
scythe
and
turned
his
cattle
loose
and
became
a
cog
in
a
vast
machine
for
killing
men
and
not
thistles
while
the
millionaire
sent
his
money
to
england
for
this
man
with
his
and
three
babies
left
them
on
a
mortgaged
farm
and
went
away
to
fight
for
an
idea
it
was
foolish
but
it
was
sublime
for
all
that
that
was
three
years
before
and
the
young
wife
sitting
on
the
on
this
bright
sabbath
harvest
morning
was
righteously
rebellious
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
borne
her
share
of
the
country
sorrow
two
brothers
had
been
killed
the
renter
in
whose
hands
her
husband
had
left
the
farm
had
proved
a
villain
one
year
the
farm
had
been
without
crops
and
now
the
overripe
grain
was
waiting
the
tardy
hand
of
the
neighbor
who
had
rented
it
and
who
was
cutting
his
own
grain
first
about
six
weeks
before
she
had
received
a
letter
saying
we
be
discharged
in
a
little
while
but
no
other
word
had
come
from
him
she
had
seen
by
the
papers
that
his
army
was
being
discharged
and
from
day
to
day
other
soldiers
slowly
percolated
in
blue
streams
back
into
the
state
and
county
but
still
her
hero
did
not
return
each
week
she
had
told
the
children
that
he
was
coming
and
she
had
watched
the
road
so
long
that
it
had
become
unconscious
and
as
she
stood
at
the
well
or
by
the
kitchen
door
her
eyes
were
fixed
unthinkingly
on
the
road
that
wound
down
the
coolly
nothing
wears
on
the
human
soul
like
waiting
if
the
stranded
mariner
searching
the
seas
could
once
give
up
hope
of
a
ship
that
horrible
grinding
on
his
brain
would
cease
it
was
this
waiting
hoping
on
the
edge
of
despair
that
gave
emma
smith
no
rest
neighbors
said
with
kind
intentions
he
sick
maybe
an
ca
start
north
just
yet
he
come
along
one
o
these
days
why
do
he
write
was
her
question
which
silenced
them
all
this
sunday
morning
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
could
not
stand
it
longer
the
house
seemed
intolerably
lonely
so
she
dressed
the
little
ones
in
their
best
calico
dresses
and
jackets
and
closing
up
the
house
set
off
down
the
coolly
to
old
mother
gray
old
widder
gray
lived
at
the
mouth
of
the
coolly
she
was
a
widow
woman
with
a
large
family
of
stalwart
boys
and
laughing
girls
she
was
the
visible
incarnation
of
hospitality
and
optimistic
poverty
with
western
she
fed
every
mouth
that
asked
food
of
her
and
worked
herself
to
death
as
cheerfully
as
her
girls
danced
in
the
neighborhood
harvest
dances
she
waddled
down
the
path
to
meet
smith
with
a
broad
smile
on
her
face
oh

little
dears

right
to
your

she
led
the
way
into
the
best
room
a
sunny
square
room
carpeted
with
a
faded
and
patched
rag
carpet
and
papered
with
where
a
few
faded
effigies
of
dead
members
of
the
family
hung
in
variously
sized
oval
walnut
frames
the
house
resounded
with
singing
laughter
whistling
tramping
of
heavy
boots
and
riotous
scufflings
boys
came
to
the
door
and
crooked
their
fingers
at
the
children
who
ran
out
and
were
soon
heard
in
the
midst
of
the
fun
do

smith
shook
her
head
turn
up
some
day
when
you
ai
lookin
for
the
good
old
soul

so
many
times

up
a
piece
of
this
cheese
it
was
beyond
human
nature
to
resist
the
influence
of
that
noisy
hearty
loving
household
and
in
the
midst
of
the
singing
and
laughing
the
wife
forgot
her
anxiety
for
the
time
at
least
and
laughed
and
sang
with
the
rest
about
eleven
a
more

up
to
the
door
and
bill
gray
the
widow

his
whole
family
from

coolly
piled
out
amid
a
uproar
every

at
once
except
bill
who
sat
in
the
wagon
with
his
wrists
on
his
knees
a
straw
in

mouth
and
an
amused
twinkle
in
his
blue
eyes

giant

laughed
in
pretended
dismay
the
two
older
boys
who
had
served
their
time
in
the
army
lay
out
on
the
grass
before
the
house
and
whittled
and
talked
desultorily
about
the
war
and
the
crops
and
planned
buying
a
the
older
girls
and
smith
helped
enlarge
the
table
and
put
on
the
dishes
talking
all
the
time
in
that
cheery
incoherent
and
meaningful
way
a
group
of
such
women
have
a
conversation
to
be
taken
for
its
spirit
rather
than
for
its
letter
though
gray
at
last
got
the
ear
of
them
all
and
dissertated
at
length
on
girls
girls

the
girls
giggled
and
blushed
all
through
this
tirade
from
their
mother
their
broad
faces
and
powerful
frames
anything
but
suggestive
of
lackadaisical
sentiment
but
smith
said
now

potatoes

of
boiled
corn
on
the
cob
squash
and
pumpkin
pies
hot
biscuit
sweet
pickles
bread
and
butter
and
honey
then
one
of
the
girls
took
down
a
from
a
nail
and
going
to
the
door
blew
a
long
fine
tree
blast
that
showed
there
was
no
weakness
of
lungs
in
her
ample
chest
then
the
children
came
out
of
the
forest
of
corn
out
of
the
creek
out
of
the
loft
of
the
barn
and
out
of
the

shining
with
delight
the
men
shut
up
their
and
surrounded
the
to
souse
their
faces
in
the
cold
hard
water
and
in
a
few
moments
the
table
was
filled
with
a
merry
crowd
and
a
row
of
youngsters
circled
the
kitchen
wall
where
they
stood
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
in
impatient
hunger
now
pitch
in
smith
said
gray

over
the
table

and
shoved
back
and
one
by
one
the
children
slipped
into
their
places
and
by
two
the
women
alone
remained
around
the
table
sipping
their
tea
and
telling
fortunes
as
they
got
well
down
to
the
grounds
in
the
cup
they
shook
them
with
a
circular
motion
in
the
hand
and
then
turned
them
quickly
in
the
saucer
then
twirled
them
three
or
four
times
one
way
and
three
or
four
times
the
other
during
a
breathless
pause
then
gray
lifted
the
cup
and
gazing
into
it
with
profound
gravity
pronounced
the
impending
fate
it
must
be
admitted
that
to
a
critical
observer
she
had
abundant
preparation
for
hitting
close
to
the
mark
as
when
she
told
the
girls
that
somebody
was
comin
it
a
man
she
went
on
gravely
he
is
oh
you
hush
cried
nettie
he
has
red

death
on
corn
and
hot
biscuit

said
the
priestess
with
a
lofty
gesture
his
hair
is
black
he
do
eat
so
much
and
he
works
more
the
girls
exploded
in
a
shriek
of
laughter
and
pounded
their
sister
on
the
back
at
last
came
smith
turn
and
she
was
trembling
with
excitement
as
gray
again
composed
her
jolly
face
to
what
she
considered
a
proper
solemnity
of
expression
somebody
is
comin
to
you
she
said
after
a
long
pause
he
got
a
musket
on
his
back
he
a
soldier
he
almost
here
see
she
pointed
at
two
little
which
really
formed
a
faint
suggestion
of
a
man
with
a
musket
on
his
back
he
had
climbed
nearly
to
the
edge
of
the
cup
smith
grew
pale
with
excitement
she
trembled
so
she
could
hardly
hold
the
cup
in
her
hand
as
she
gazed
into
it
it
ed
cried
the
old
woman
he
on
the
way
home
heavens
earth
there
he
is
now
she
turned
and
waved
her
hand
out
toward
the
road
they
rushed
to
the
door
to
look
where
she
pointed
a
man
in
a
blue
coat
with
a
musket
on
his
back
was
toiling
slowly
up
the
hill
on
the
dusty
road
toiling
slowly
with
bent
head
half
hidden
by
a
heavy
knapsack
so
tired
it
seemed
that
walking
was
indeed
a
process
of
falling
so
eager
to
get
home
he
would
not
stop
would
not
look
aside
but
plodded
on
amid
the
cries
of
the
locusts
the
welcome
of
the
crickets
and
the
rustle
of
the
yellow
wheat
getting
back
to
god
country
and
his
wife
and
babies
laughing
crying
trying
to
call
him
and
the
children
at
the
same
time
the
little
wife
almost
hysterical
snatched
her
hat
and
ran
out
into
the
yard
but
the
soldier
had
disappeared
over
the
hill
into
the
hollow
beyond
and
by
the
time
she
had
found
the
children
he
was
too
far
away
for
her
voice
to
reach
him
and
besides
she
was
not
sure
it
was
her
husband
for
he
had
not
turned
his
head
at
their
shouts
this
seemed
so
strange
why
did
he
stop
to
rest
at
his
old
neighbor
house
tortured
by
hope
and
doubt
she
hurried
up
the
coolly
as
fast
as
she
could
push
the
baby
wagon
the
figure
just
ahead
pushing
steadily
silently
forward
up
the
coolly
when
the
excited
panting
little
group
came
in
sight
of
the
gate
they
saw
the
figure
standing
leaning
upon
the
rough
rail
fence
his
chin
on
his
palms
gazing
at
the
empty
house
his
knapsack
canteen
blankets
and
musket
lay
upon
the
dusty
grass
at
his
feet
he
was
like
a
man
lost
in
a
dream
his
wide
hungry
eyes
devoured
the
scene
the
rough
lawn
the
little
unpainted
house
the
field
of
clear
yellow
wheat
behind
it
down
across
which
streamed
the
sun
now
almost
ready
to
touch
the
high
hill
to
the
west
the
crickets
crying
merrily
a
cat
on
the
fence
near
by
dreaming
unmindful
of
the
stranger
in
blue
how
peaceful
it
all
was
o
god
how
far
removed
from
all
camps
hospitals
battle
lines
a
little
cabin
in
a
wisconsin
coolly
but
it
was
majestic
in
its
peace
how
did
he
ever
leave
it
for
those
years
of
tramping
thirsting
killing
trembling
weak
with
emotion
her
eyes
on
the
silent
figure
smith
hurried
up
to
the
fence
her
feet
made
no
noise
in
the
dust
and
grass
and
they
were
close
upon
him
before
he
knew
of
them
the
oldest
boy
ran
a
little
ahead
he
will
never
forget
that
figure
that
face
it
will
always
remain
as
something
epic
that
return
of
the
private
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
pale
face
covered
with
a
ragged
beard
who
are
you
sir
asked
the
wife
or
rather
started
to
ask
for
he
turned
stood
a
moment
and
then
cried
emma
edward
the
children
stood
in
a
curious
row
to
see
their
mother
kiss
this
bearded
strange
man
the
elder
girl
sobbing
sympathetically
with
her
mother
illness
had
left
the
soldier
partly
deaf
and
this
added
to
the
strangeness
of
his
manner
but
the
youngest
child
stood
away
even
after
the
girl
had
recognized
her
father
and
kissed
him
the
man
turned
then
to
the
baby
and
said
in
a
curiously
unpaternal
tone
come
here
my
little
man
do
you
know
me
but
the
baby
backed
away
under
the
fence
and
stood
peering
at
him
critically
my
little
man
what
meaning
in
those
words
this
baby
seemed
like
some
other
woman
child
and
not
the
infant
he
had
left
in
his
wife
arms
the
war
had
come
between
him
and
his
baby
he
was
only
a
strange
man
to
him
with
big
eyes
a
soldier
with
mother
hanging
to
his
arm
and
talking
in
a
loud
voice
and
this
is
tom
the
private
said
drawing
the
oldest
boy
to
him
he
come
and
see
me
he
knows
his
poor
old
pap
when
he
comes
home
from
the
war
the
mother
heard
the
pain
and
reproach
in
his
voice
and
hastened
to
apologize
you
changed
so
ed
he
ca
know
yeh
this
is
papa
teddy
come
and
kiss
him
tom
and
mary
do
come
wo
you
but
teddy
still
peered
through
the
fence
with
solemn
eyes
well
out
of
reach
he
resembled
a
kitten
that
hesitates
studying
the
tones
of
one
voice
i
fix
him
said
the
soldier
and
sat
down
to
undo
his
knapsack
out
of
which
he
drew
three
enormous
and
very
red
apples
after
giving
one
to
each
of
the
older
children
he
said
now
i
guess
he
come
eh
my
little
man
now
come
see
your
pap
teddy
crept
slowly
under
the
fence
assisted
by
the
overzealous
tommy
and
a
moment
later
was
kicking
and
squalling
in
his
father
arms
then
they
entered
the
house
into
the
sitting
room
poor
bare
little
room
too
with
its
rag
carpet
its
square
clock
and
its
two
or
three
chromos
and
pictures
from
harper
weekly
pinned
about
emma
i
all
tired
out
said
private
smith
as
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
carpet
as
he
used
to
do
while
his
wife
brought
a
pillow
to
put
under
his
head
and
the
children
stood
about
munching
their
apples
tommy
you
run
and
get
me
a
pan
of
chips
and
mary
you
get
the
on
and
i
go
and
make
some
biscuit
and
the
soldier
talked
question
after
question
he
poured
forth
about
the
crops
the
cattle
the
renter
the
neighbors
he
slipped
his
heavy
government
brogan
shoes
off
his
poor
tired
blistered
feet
and
lay
out
with
utter
sweet
relaxation
he
was
a
free
man
again
no
longer
a
soldier
under
command
at
supper
he
stopped
once
listened
and
smiled
that
old
spot
i
know
her
voice
i
that
her
calf
out
there
in
the
pen
i
ca
milk
her
though
i
too
tired
but
i
tell
you
i
like
a
drink
o
her
milk
what
become
of
old
rove
he
died
last
winter
poisoned
i
guess
there
was
a
moment
of
sadness
for
them
all
it
was
some
time
before
the
husband
spoke
again
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
poor
old
feller
he
known
me
a
half
a
mile
away
i
expected
him
to
come
down
the
hill
to
meet
me
it
been
more
like
comin
home
if
i
could
seen
him
comin

she
hastened
to
explain

one

cup
o
tea
mary
that
my
girl
feeling
better
already
i
just
the
matter
with
me
is
starved
this
was
a
delicious
hour
one
long
to
be
remembered
they
were
like
lovers
again
but
their
tenderness
like
that
of
a
typical
american
family
found
utterance
in
tones
rather
than
in
words
he
was
praising
her
when
praising
her
biscuit
and
she
knew
it
they
grew
soberer
when
he
showed
where
he
had
been
struck
one
ball
burning
the
back
of
his
hand
one
cutting
away
a
lock
of
hair
from
his
temple
and
one
passing
through
the
calf
of
his
leg
the
wife
shuddered
to
think
how
near
she
had
come
to
being
a
soldier
widow
her
waiting
no
longer
seemed
hard
this
sweet
glorious
hour
effaced
it
all
then
they
rose
and
all
went
out
into
the
garden
and
down
to
the
barn
he
stood
beside
her
while
she
milked
old
spot
they
began
to
plan
fields
and
crops
for
next
year
his
farm
was
weedy
and
encumbered
a
rascally
renter
had
run
away
with
his
machinery
departing
between
two
days
his
children
needed
clothing
the
years
were
coming
upon
him
he
was
sick
and
emaciated
but
his
heroic
soul
did
not
quail
with
the
same
courage
with
which
he
faced
his
southern
march
he
entered
upon
a
still
more
hazardous
future
oh
that
mystic
hour
the
pale
man
with
big
eyes
standing
there
by
the
well
with
his
young
wife
by
his
side
the
vast
moon
swinging
above
the
eastern
peaks
the
cattle
winding
down
the
pasture
slopes
with
jangling
bells
the
crickets
singing
the
stars
blooming
out
sweet
and
far
and
serene
the
katydids
rhythmically
calling
the
little
turkeys
crying
querulously
as
they
settled
to
roost
in
the
poplar
tree
near
the
open
gate
the
voices
at
the
well
drop
lower
the
little
ones
nestle
in
their
father
arms
at
last
and
teddy
falls
asleep
there
the
common
soldier
of
the
american
volunteer
army
had
returned
his
war
with
the
south
was
over
and
his
fight
his
daily
running
fight
with
nature
and
against
the
injustice
of
his
was
begun
again
under
the
lion
paw
along
this
road
trailed
an
endless
line
of
prairie
schooners
coming
into
sight
at
the
east
and
passing
out
of
sight
over
the
swell
to
the
west
we
children
used
to
wonder
where
they
were
going
and
why
they
went
i
it
was
the
last
of
autumn
and
first
day
of
winter
coming
together
all
day
long
the
ploughmen
on
their
prairie
farms
had
moved
to
and
fro
in
their
wide
level
fields
through
the
falling
snow
which
melted
as
it
fell
wetting
them
to
the
skin
all
day
notwithstanding
the
frequent
squalls
of
snow
the
dripping
desolate
clouds
and
the
muck
of
the
furrows
black
and
tenacious
as
tar
under
their
dripping
harness
the
horses
swung
to
and
fro
silently
with
that
marvellous
uncomplaining
patience
which
marks
the
horse
all
day
the
wild
geese
honking
wildly
as
they
sprawled
sidewise
down
the
wind
seemed
to
be
fleeing
from
an
enemy
behind
and
with
neck
outthrust
and
wings
extended
sailed
down
the
wind
soon
lost
to
sight
yet
the
ploughman
behind
his
plough
though
the
snow
lay
on
his
ragged
and
the
cold
clinging
mud
rose
on
his
heavy
boots
fettering
him
like
gyves
whistled
in
the
very
beard
of
the
gale
as
day
passed
the
snow
ceasing
to
melt
lay
along
the
ploughed
land
and
lodged
in
the
depth
of
the
stubble
till
on
each
slow
round
the
last
furrow
stood
out
black
and
shining
as
jet
between
the
ploughed
land
and
the
gray
stubble
when
night
began
to
fall
and
the
geese
flying
low
began
to
alight
invisibly
in
the
near
stephen
council
was
still
at
work
finishing
a
land
he
rode
on
his
sulky
plough
when
going
with
the
wind
but
walked
when
facing
it
sitting
bent
and
cold
but
cheery
under
his
slouch
hat
he
talked
encouragingly
to
his
come

once

they
seemed
to
know
what
he
meant
and
that
this
was
the
last
round
for
they
worked
with
greater
vigor
than
before
once
more
boys
an
then
sez
i
oats
an
a
nice
warm
stall
an
sleep
all
by
the
time
the
last
furrow
was
turned
on
the
land
it
was
too
dark
to
see
the
house
and
the
snow
was
changing
to
rain
again
the
tired
and
hungry
man
could
see
the
light
from
the
kitchen
shining
through
the
leafless
hedge
and
he
lifted
a
great
shout
supper
a
half
a
dozen
it
was
nearly
eight
by
the
time
he
had
finished
his
chores
and
started
for
supper
he
was
picking
his
way
carefully
through
the
mud
when
the
tall
form
of
a
man
loomed
up
before
him
with
a
premonitory
cough
waddy
ye
want
was
the
rather
startled
question
of
the
farmer
well

began
the
stranger
in
a
deprecating
tone

sech
as

but
the
stranger
had
disappeared
and
soon
his
steaming
weary
team
with
drooping
heads
and
swinging
moved
past
the
well
to
the
block
beside
the
path
council
stood
at
the
side
of
the
schooner
and
helped
the
children
out
two
little
children
and
then
a
small
woman
with
a
babe
in
her
arms
there

jovially

said
to

dazed
and
silent

at
his
side

shouted

fragrant
and
warmly
lighted
kitchen

drinking
milk
council
got
out
his
lantern
and
went
out
to
the
barn
to
help
the
stranger
about
his
team
where
his
loud
hearty
voice
could
be
heard
as
it
came
and
went
between
the
haymow
and
the
stalls
the
woman
came
to
light
as
a
small
timid
and
woman
but
still
pretty
in

thin
and
sorrowful

going

she

with
bread
and
milk
and
the
woman
thoroughly
at
home
eating
some
toast
and
pickles
and
sipping

right
there
mis
haskins
i
wo
have
you
stir
a
finger
it
was
an
unmeasured
pleasure
to
sit
there
in
the
warm
homely
kitchen
the
jovial
chatter
of
the
housewife
driving
out
and
holding
at
bay
the
growl
of
the
impotent
cheated
wind
the
little
woman
eyes
filled
with
tears
which
fell
down
upon
the
sleeping
baby
in
her
arms
the
world
was
not
so
desolate
and
cold
and
hopeless
after
all
now
i
hope
council
wo
stop
out
there
and
talk
politics
all
night
he
the
greatest
man
to
talk
politics
an
read
the
tribune
how
old
is
it
she
broke
off
and
peered
down
at
the
face
of
the
babe
two
months
five
days
said
the
mother
with
a
mother
exactness
ye
do
say
i
want
know
the
dear
little
she
went
on
stirring
it
up
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
ribs
with
her
fat
forefinger
pooty
tough
on
to
go
lots
this
way
yes
that
so
a
man
ca
lift
a
mountain
said
council
entering
the
door
mother
this
is
haskins
from
kansas
he
been
eat
up
drove
out
by
grasshoppers
glad
t
see
yeh
pa
empty
that
give
him
a
chance
haskins
was
a
tall
man
with
a
thin
gloomy
face
his
hair
was
a
reddish
brown
like
his
coat
and
seemed
equally
faded
by
the
wind
and
sun
and
his
sallow
face
though
hard
and
set
was
pathetic
somehow
you
would
have
felt
that
he
had
suffered
much
by
the
line
of
his
mouth
showing
under
his
thin
yellow
mustache
had
ike
got
home
yet
sairy
had
seen
set
right
up
haskins
wade
right
into
what
we
got
much
but
we
manage
to
live
on
it
she
gits
fat
on
it
laughed
council
pointing
his
thumb
at
his
wife
after
supper
while
the
women
put
the
children
to
bed
haskins
and
council
talked
on
seated
near
the
huge
the
steam
rising
from
their
wet
clothing
in
the
western
fashion
council
told
as
much
of
his
own
life
as
he
drew
from
his
guest
he
asked
but
few
questions
but
by
and
by
the
story
of
haskins
struggles
and
defeat
came
out
the
story
was
a
terrible
one
but
he
told
it
quietly
seated
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
gazing
most
of
the
time
at
the
hearth
i
did
like
the
looks
of
the
country
anyhow
haskins
said
partly
rising
and
glancing
at
his
wife
i
was
ust
t
northern
ingyannie
where
we
have
lots
o
timber
lots
o
rain
i
did
like
the
looks
that
dry
prairie
what
galled
me
the

haskins
listened
a
moment
to
the
wind
in
the
eaves
and
then
said
with
a
slow
and
solemn
tone

ii
jim
butler
was
one
of
those
men
called
in
the
west
land
poor
early
in
the
history
of
rock
river
he
had
come
into
the
town
and
started
in
the
grocery
business
in
a
small
way
occupying
a
small
building
in
a
mean
part
of
the
town
at
this
period
of
his
life
he
earned
all
he
got
and
was
up
early
and
late
sorting
beans
working
over
butter
and
carting
his
goods
to
and
from
the
station
but
a
change
came
over
him
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
when
he
sold
a
lot
of
land
for
four
times
what
he
paid
for
it
from
that
time
forward
he
believed
in
land
speculation
as
the
surest
way
of
getting
rich
every
cent
he
could
save
or
spare
from
his
trade
he
put
into
land
at
forced
sale
or
mortgages
on
land
which
were
just
as
good
as
the
wheat
he
was
accustomed
to
say
farm
after
farm
fell
into
his
hands
until
he
was
recognized
as
one
of
the
leading
landowners
of
the
county
his
mortgages
were
scattered
all
over
cedar
county
and
as
they
slowly
but
surely
fell
in
he
sought
usually
to
retain
the
former
owner
as
tenant
he
was
not
ready
to
foreclose
indeed
he
had
the
name
of
being
one
of
the
easiest
men
in
the
town
he
let
the
debtor
off
again
and
again
extending
the
time
whenever
possible
i
do
want
land
he
said
all
i
after
is
the
on
my
money
that
all
now
if
y
want
stay
on
the
farm
why
i
give
y
a
good
chance
i
ca
have
the
land
layin
vacant
and
in
many
cases
the
owner
remained
as
tenant
in
the
meantime
he
had
sold
his
store
he
could
spend
time
in
it
he
was
mainly
occupied
now
with
sitting
around
town
on
rainy
days
smoking
and
gassin
with
the
boys
or
in
riding
to
and
from
his
farms
in
he
fished
a
good
deal
doc
grimes
ben
ashley
and
cal
cheatham
were
his
cronies
on
these
fishing
excursions
or
hunting
trips
in
the
time
of
chickens
or
partridges
in
winter
they
went
to
northern
wisconsin
to
shoot
deer
in
spite
of
all
these
signs
of
easy
life
butler
persisted
in
saying
he
had
enough
money
to
pay
taxes
on
his
land
and
was
careful
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
was
poor
in
spite
of
his
twenty
farms
at
one
time
he
was
said
to
be
worth
fifty
thousand
dollars
but
land
had
been
a
little
slow
of
sale
of
late
so
that
he
was
not
worth
so
much
a
fine
farm
known
as
the
higley
place
had
fallen
into
his
hands
in
the
usual
way
the
previous
year
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
a
tenant
for
it
poor
higley
after
working
himself
nearly
to
death
on
it
in
the
attempt
to
lift
the
mortgage
had
gone
off
to
dakota
leaving
the
farm
and
his
curse
to
butler
this
was
the
farm
which
council
advised
haskins
to
apply
for
and
the
next
day
council
hitched
up
his
team
and
drove
down
to
see
butler
you
jest
let
me
do
the
talkin
he
said
we
find
him
wearin
out
his
pants
on
some
salt
barrel
and
if
he
thought
you
wanted
a
place
he
sock
it
to
you

he
chirruped
to
the
team
which
sprang
forward
with
the
rumbling
clattering
wagon
say
looky
here
council
you
ca
do
this
i
never
saw
shouted
haskins
in
his
neighbor
ear
council
moved
about
uneasily
in
his
seat
and
stopped
his
stammering
gratitude
by
saying
hold
on
now
do
make
such
a
fuss
over
a
little
thing
when
i
see
a
man
down
an
things
all
on
top
of
i
jest
like
t
kick
off
an
help
up
that
the
kind
of
religion
i
got
it
about
the
only
kind
they
rode
the
rest
of
the
way
home
in
silence
and
when
the
red
light
of
the
lamp
shone
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
cold
and
windy
night
and
he
thought
of
this
refuge
for
his
children
and
wife
haskins
could
have
put
his
arm
around
the
neck
of
his
burly
companion
and
squeezed
him
like
a
lover
but
he
contented
himself
with
saying
steve
council
git
pay
this
some
day
do
want
any
pay
my
religion
ai
run
on
such
business
principles
the
wind
was
growing
colder
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
a
white
frost
as
they
turned
into
the
gate
of
the
council
farm
and
the
children
came
rushing
out
shouting
papa
come
they
hardly
looked
like
the
same
children
who
had
sat
at
the
table
the
night
before
their
torpidity
under
the
influence
of
sunshine
and
mother
council
had
given
way
to
a
sort
of
spasmodic
cheerfulness
as
insects
in
winter
revive
when
laid
on
the
hearth
iii
haskins
worked
like
a
fiend
and
his
wife
like
the
heroic
woman
that
she
was
bore
also
uncomplainingly
the
most
terrible
burdens
they
rose
early
and
toiled
without
intermission
till
the
darkness
fell
on
the
plain
then
tumbled
into
bed
every
bone
and
muscle
aching
with
fatigue
to
rise
with
the
sun
next
morning
to
the
same
round
of
the
same
ferocity
of
labor
the
eldest
boy
drove
a
team
all
through
the
spring
ploughing
and
seeding
milked
the
cows
and
did
chores
innumerable
in
most
ways
taking
the
place
of
a
man
an
infinitely
pathetic
but
common
figure
this
boy
on
the
american
farm
where
there
is
no
law
against
child
labor
to
see
him
in
his
coarse
clothing
his
huge
boots
and
his
ragged
cap
as
he
staggered
with
a
pail
of
water
from
the
well
or
trudged
in
the
cold
and
cheerless
dawn
out
into
the
frosty
field
behind
his
team
gave
the
visitor
a
sharp
pang
of
sympathetic
pain
yet
haskins
loved
his
boy
and
would
have
saved
him
from
this
if
he
could
but
he
could
not
by
june
the
first
year
the
result
of
such
herculean
toil
began
to
show
on
the
farm
the
yard
was
cleaned
up
and
sown
to
grass
the
garden
ploughed
and
planted
and
the
house
mended
council
had
given
them
four
of
his
cows
take
an
run
on
shares
i
do
want
milk
s
many
away
s
much
now
an
i
ca
stand
the
bother
anyhow
other
men
seeing
the
confidence
of
council
in
the
newcomer
had
sold
him
tools
on
time
and
as
he
was
really
an
able
farmer
he
soon
had
round
him
many
evidences
of
his
care
and
thrift
at
the
advice
of
council
he
had
taken
the
farm
for
three
years
with
the
privilege
of
or
buying
at
the
end
of
the
term
it
a
good
bargain
an
y
want
nail
it
said
council
if
you
have
any
kind
ov
a
crop
you
pay
debts
an
keep
seed
bread
the
new
hope
which
now
sprang
up
in
the
heart
of
haskins
and
his
wife
grew
almost
as
a
pain
by
the
time
the
wide
field
of
wheat
began
to
wave
and
rustle
and
swirl
in
the
winds
of
july
day
after
day
he
would
snatch
a
few
moments
after
supper
to
go
and
look
at
it
ye
seen
the
wheat
nettie
he
asked
one
night
as
he
rose
from
supper
no
tim
i
ai
had
time
well
take
time
now
le
go
look
at
it
she
threw
an
old
hat
on
her
head
tommy
hat
and
looking
almost
pretty
in
her
thin
sad
way
went
out
with
her
husband
to
the
hedge
ai
it
grand
nettie
just
look
at
it
it
was
grand
level
russet
here
and
there
wide
as
a
lake
and
full
of
multitudinous
whispers
and
gleams
of
wealth
it
stretched
away
before
the
gazers
like
the
fabled
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
oh
i
think
i
hope
we
have
a
good
crop
tim
and
oh
how
good
the
people
have
been
to
us
yes
i
do
know
where
we
be
if
it
had
ben
council
and
his
wife
they
the
best
people
in
the
world
said
the
little
woman
with
a
great
sob
of
gratitude
we
be
in
the
field
on
monday
sure
said
haskins
gripping
the
rail
on
the
fence
as
if
already
at
the
work
of
the
harvest
the
harvest
came
bounteous
glorious
but
the
winds
came
and
blew
it
into
tangles
and
the
rain
matted
it
here
and
there
close
to
the
ground
increasing
the
work
of
gathering
it
threefold
oh
how
they
toiled
in
those
glorious
days
clothing
dripping
with
sweat
arms
aching
filled
with
briers
fingers
raw
and
bleeding
backs
broken
with
the
weight
of
heavy
bundles
haskins
and
his
man
toiled
on
tommy
drove
the
harvester
while
his
father
and
a
hired
man
bound
on
the
machine
in
this
way
they
cut
ten
acres
every
day
and
almost
every
night
after
supper
when
the
hand
went
to
bed
haskins
returned
to
the
field
shocking
the
bound
grain
in
the
light
of
the
moon
many
a
night
he
worked
till
his
anxious
wife
came
out
at
ten
to
call
him
in
to
rest
and
lunch
at
the
same
time
she
cooked
for
the
men
took
care
of
the
children
washed
and
ironed
milked
the
cows
at
night
made
the
butter
and
sometimes
fed
the
horses
and
watered
them
while
her
husband
kept
at
the
shocking
no
slave
in
the
roman
galleys
could
have
toiled
so
frightfully
and
lived
for
this
man
thought
himself
a
free
man
and
that
he
was
working
for
his
wife
and
babes
when
he
sank
into
his
bed
with
a
deep
groan
of
relief
too
tired
to
change
his
grimy
dripping
clothing
he
felt
that
he
was
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
home
of
his
own
and
pushing
the
wolf
of
want
a
little
farther
from
his
door
there
is
no
despair
so
deep
as
the
despair
of
a
homeless
man
or
woman
to
roam
the
roads
of
the
country
or
the
streets
of
the
city
to
feel
there
is
no
rood
of
ground
on
which
the
feet
can
rest
to
halt
weary
and
hungry
outside
lighted
windows
and
hear
laughter
and
song
within
these
are
the
hungers
and
rebellions
that
drive
men
to
crime
and
women
to
shame
it
was
the
memory
of
this
homelessness
and
the
fear
of
its
coming
again
that
spurred
timothy
haskins
and
nettie
his
wife
to
such
ferocious
labor
during
that
first
year
iv
yes
yes
said
butler
as
his
eye
took
in
the
neat
garden
the
and
the
barnyard
you
quite
a
stock
around
yeh
done
well
eh
haskins
was
showing
butler
around
the
place
he
had
not
seen
it
for

said
butler
picking
his
teeth
with
a
straw
about
that
said
haskins
modestly
we
begin
to
feel
if
we
was
a
home
ourselves
but
we
worked
hard

to

who

of
something

i

well
yes

um
m
what
do

call
a
reasonable
show
well
say
a
quarter
down
and
three
years
time
butler
looked
at
the
huge
stacks
of
wheat
which
filled
the
yard
over
which
the
chickens
were
fluttering
and
crawling
catching
grasshoppers
and
out
of
which
the
crickets
were
singing
innumerably
he
smiled
in
a
peculiar
way
as
he
said
oh
i
wo
be
hard
on
yeh
but
what
did
you
expect
to
pay
the
place
why
about
what
you
offered
it
for
before
two
thousand
five
hundred
or
possibly
three
thousand
dollars
he
added
quickly
as
he
saw
the
owner
shake
his
head
this
farm
is
worth
five
thousand
and
five
hundred
dollars
said
butler
in
a
careless
and
decided
voice
what
almost
shrieked
the
astounded
haskins
what
that
five
thousand
why
that
double
what
you
offered
it
for
three
years
ago
of
course
and
it
worth
it
it
was
all
run
down
then
now
it
in
good
shape
you
laid
out
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
improvements
according
to
your
own
story
but
you
had
nothin
t
do
about
that
it
my
work
an
my
money
you
bet
it
was
but
it
my
land
but
what
to
pay
me
for
all
my
ai
you
had
the
use
of
replied
butler
smiling
calmly
into
his
face
haskins
was
like
a
man
struck
on
the
head
with
a
sandbag
he
think
he
stammered
as
he
tried
to
say
but
i
never
git
the
use
you
rob
me
that
you
agreed
you
promised
that
i
could
buy
or
rent
at
the
end
of

years
at
that
all
right
but
i
did
say
i
let
you
carry
off
the
improvements
nor

farm

land

the
question

hundred
dollars

year

or

on
your
own
terms

he
was
turning
away
when
haskins
the
sweat
pouring
from
his
face
fronted
him
saying
again
but
you
done
nothing
to
make
it
so
you
hai
added
a
cent
i
put
it
all
there

butler
laughed
you
too
green
t
eat
young
feller
your
improvements
the
law
will
sing
another
tune
but
i
trusted
your
word
never

anybody
my
friend
besides
i
did
promise
not
to
do
this
thing
why
man

at

like
that
do
take
me
for
a
thief
it

thing

stealin
jest
the
same
you
take
three
thousand
dollars
of
my
money
the
work
o
my
hands
and
my
wife
he
broke
down
at
this
point
he
was
not
a
strong
man
mentally
he
could
face
hardship
ceaseless
toil
but
he
could
not
face
the
cold
and
sneering
face
of
butler
but
i
do
take
it
said
butler
coolly
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
go
on
jest
as
you
been
or
give
me
a
thousand
dollars
down
and
a
mortgage
at
ten
per
cent
on
the
rest
haskins
sat
down
blindly
on
a
bundle
of
oats
near
by
and
with
staring
eyes
and
drooping
head
went
over
the
situation
he
was
under
the
paw
he
felt
a
horrible
numbness
in
his
heart
and
limbs
he
was
hid
in
a
mist
and
there
was
no
path
out
butler
walked
about
looking
at
the
huge
stacks
of
grain
and
pulling
now
and
again
a
few
handfuls
out
shelling
the
heads
in
his
hands
and
blowing
the
chaff
away
he
hummed
a
little
tune
as
he
did
so
he
had
an
accommodating
air
of
waiting
haskins
was
in
the
midst
of
the
terrible
toil
of
the
last
year
he
was
walking
again
in
the
rain
and
the
mud
behind
his
plough
he
felt
the
dust
and
dirt
of
the
threshing
the
ferocious
with
its
cutting
wind
and
biting
clinging
snows
lay
hard
upon
him
then
he
thought
of
his
wife
how
she
had
cheerfully
cooked
and
baked
without
holiday
and
without
rest
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
inquired
the
cool
mocking
insinuating
voice
of
butler
i
think
you
a
thief
and
a
liar
shouted
haskins
leaping
up
a
houn
butler
smile
maddened
him
with
a
sudden
leap
he
caught
a
fork
in
his
hands
and
whirled
it
in
the
air
you
never
rob
another
man
damn
ye
he
grated
through
his
teeth
a
look
of
pitiless
ferocity
in
his
accusing
eyes
butler
shrank
and
quivered
expecting
the
blow
stood
held
hypnotized
by
the
eyes
of
the
man
he
had
a
moment
before
despised
a
man
transformed
into
an
avenging
demon
but
in
the
deadly
hush
between
the
lift
of
the
weapon
and
its
fall
there
came
a
gush
of
faint
childish
laughter
and
then
across
the
range
of
his
vision
far
away
and
dim
he
saw
the
head
of
his
baby
girl
as
with
the
pretty
tottering
run
of
a
she
moved
across
the
grass
of
the
dooryard
his
hands
relaxed
the
fork
fell
to
the
ground
his
head
lowered
make
out
deed
an
an
git
my
land
an
do
ye
never
cross
my
line
agin
if
y
do
i
kill
ye
butler
backed
away
from
the
man
in
wild
haste
and
climbing
into
his
buggy
with
trembling
limbs
drove
off
down
the
road
leaving
haskins
seated
dumbly
on
the
sunny
pile
of
sheaves
his
head
sunk
into
his
hands
the
creamery
man
along
these
woods
in
storm
and
sun
the
busy
people
go
the
has
gone
out
of
the
west
amiable
gossip
and
sharp
trader
that
he
was
his
visits
once
brought
a
sharp
business
grapple
to
the
farmer
wife
and
daughters
after
which
as
the
man
of
trade
was
repacking
his
unsold
wares
a
moment
of
cheerful
talk
often
took
place
it
was
his
cue
if
he
chanced
to
be
a
tactful
peddler
to
drop
all
attempts
at
sale
and
become
distinctly
human
and
neighborly
his
calls
were
not
always
well
received
but
they
were
at
their
best
pleasant
breaks
of
a
monotonous
round
of
duties
but
he
is
no
longer
a
familiar
spot
on
the
landscape
he
has
passed
into
the
limbo
of
the
things
no
longer
necessary
his
red
wagon
may
be
rumbling
and
rattling
through
some
newer
region
but
the
coolly
country
knows
him
no
more
the
creamery
man
has
taken
his
place
every
afternoon
rain
or
shine
the
wagons
of
the
north
star
creamery
in
dutcher
coolly
stop
at
the
farmers
windmills
to
skim
the
cream
from
the
submerged
cans
his
wagon
is
not
gay
it
is
generally
battered
and
covered
with
mud
and
filled
with
tall
cans
but
the
driver
himself
is
generally
young
and
sometimes
attractive
the
driver
in
molasses
gap
which
is
a
small
coolly
leading
into
dutcher
coolly
was
particularly
and
amusing
he
was
aware
of
his
good
looks
and
his
dress
not
only
showed
that
he
was
single
but
that
he
hoped
to
be
married
soon
he
wore
brown
trousers
which
fitted
him
very
well
and
a
dark
blue
shirt
which
had
a
gay
lacing
of
red
cord
in
front
and
a
pair
of
suspenders
that
were
a
vivid
green
on
his
head
he
wore
a
chinese
straw
helmet
which
was
as
ugly
as
anything
could
conceivably
be
but
he
was
as
proud
of
it
as
he
was
of
his
green
suspenders
in
summer
he
wore
no
coat
at
all
and
even
in
pretty
cold
weather
he
left
his
vest
on
his
not
being
able
to
bring
himself
to
the
point
of
covering
up
the
red
and
green
of
his
attire
it
was
noticeable
that
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
always
came
out
even
on
to
see
that
claude
his
name
was
claude
williams
measured
the
cream
properly
there
was
much
banter
about
this
kennedy
always
said
she
would
trust
him
fur
you
can
fling
a
yearlin
bull
by
the
tail
now
that
the
difference
between
us
he
would
reply
i
trust
you
anywhere
anybody
with
such
a
daughter
as
he
seldom
got
further
for
lucindy
always
said
in
substance
oh
you
go
there
need
be
no
mystery
in
the
matter
was
the
girl
for
whose
delight
he
wore
the
green
and
red
he
made
no
secret
of
his
love
and
she
made
no
secret
of
her
scorn
she
laughed
at
his
green
and
the
red
shoestring
in
his
shirt
but
claude
considered
himself
very
learned
in
women
ways
by
reason
of
two
years
driving
the
creamery
wagon
and
he
merely
winked
at
kennedy
when
the
girl
was
looking
and
kissed
his
hand
at
when
her
mother
was
not
looking
he
looked
forward
every
afternoon
to
these
little
exchanges
of
wit
and
was
depressed
when
for
any
reason
the
women
folks
were
away
there
were
other
places
pleasanter
than
the
kennedy
farm
some
of
the
dutchmen
had
fine
big
brick
houses
and
finer
and
bigger
barns
but
their
women
were
mostly
homely
and
went
around
and
with
ugly
blue
dresses
hanging
frayed
and
greasy
round
their
lank
ribs
and
big
joints
someway
their
big
houses
have
a
look
like
a
stable
when
you
get
close
to
claude
said
to
once
their
women
work
so
much
in
the
field
they
do
have
any
time
to
fix
up
the
way
you
do
i
believe
in
women
workin
in
the
fields
he
said
this
looking
in
the
face
my
wife
need
set
her
foot
outdoors
she
a
mind
to
oh
you
can
talk
replied
the
girl
scornfully
but
you
be
like
the
rest
of
but
she
was
glad
that
she
had
on
a
clean
collar
and
apron
if
it
was
what
claude
would
have
said
further
could
not
divine
for
her
mother
called
her
away
as
she
generally
did
when
she
saw
her
daughter
lingering
too
long
with
the
creamery
man
claude
was
not
considered
a
suitable
match
for
lucindy
kennedy
whose
father
owned
one
of
the
finest
farms
in
the
coolly
worldly
considerations
hold
in
molasses
gap
as
well
as
in
bluff
siding
and
tyre
but
claude
gave
little
heed
to
these
moods
in
kennedy
if
sputtered
he
laughed
and
if
she
smiled
he
rode
on
whistling
till
he
came
to
old
man
haldeman
who
owned
the
whole
lower
half
of
molasses
gap
and
had
one
ummarried
daughter
who
thought
claude
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
the
world
she
was
always
at
the
gate
to
greet
him
as
he
drove
up
and
forced
sections
of
cake
and
pieces
of
gooseberry
pie
upon
him
each
day
she
good
enough
for
a
dutchman
claude
said
of
her
but
i
hate
to
see
a
woman
go
around
looking
as
if
her
clothes
would
drop
off
if
it
rained
on
her
and
on
sundays
when
she
dresses
up
she
looks
like
a
boy
rigged
out
in
some
girl
duds
this
was
pretty
hard
on
nina
she
was
tall
and
lank
and
sandy
with
small
blue
eyes
her
limbs
were
heavy
and
she
did
wear
her
sunday
clothes
badly
but
she
was
a
good
generous
soul
and
very
much
in
love
with
the
creamery
man
she
was
not
very
clean
but
then
she
could
not
help
that
the
dust
of
the
field
is
no
respecter
of
sex
no
she
was
not
lovely
but
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
old
ernest
haldeman
and
the
old
man
was
not
very
strong
claude
was
the
daily
bulletin
of
the
gap
he
knew
whose
cow
died
the
night
before
who
was
at
the
strawberry
dance
and
all
about
abe
anderson
night
in
jail
up
at
the
siding
if
his
coming
was
welcome
to
the
kennedy
who
took
the
bluff
siding
gimlet
and
the
county
paper
how
much
the
more
cordial
ought
his
greeting
to
be
at
haldeman
where
they
only
took
the
milwaukee
weekly
freiheit
nina
in
her
poor
way
had
longings
and
aspirations
she
wanted
to
marry
a
yankee
and
not
one
of
her
own
kind
she
had
a
little
schooling
obtained
at
the
small
brick
shed
under
the
towering
cottonwood
tree
at
the
corner
of
her
father
farm
but
her
life
had
been
one
of
hard
work
and
mighty
little
play
her
parents
spoke
in
german
about
the
farm
and
could
speak
english
only
very
brokenly
her
only
brother
had
adventured
into
the
foreign
parts
of
pine
county
and
had
been
killed
in
a
sawmill
her
life
was
lonely
and
hard
she
had
suitors
among
the
germans
plenty
of
them
but
she
had
a
disgust
of
them
considered
as
possible
husbands
and
though
she
went
to
their
beery
dances
occasionally
she
had
always
in
her
mind
the
ease
lightness
and
color
of
claude
she
knew
that
the
yankee
girls
did
not
work
in
the
fields
even
the
norwegian
girls
seldom
did
so
now
they
worked
out
in
town
but
she
had
been
brought
up
to
hoe
and
pull
weeds
from
her
childhood
and
her
father
and
mother
considered
it
good
for
her
and
being
a
gentle
and
obedient
child
she
still
continued
to
do
as
she
was
told
claude
pitied
the
girl
and
used
to
talk
with
her
during
his
short
stay
in
his
cheeriest
manner
hello

suddenly
to
go
that
her
bare
leg

below
her
dress
her
unstockinged
feet
were
thrust
into
coarse
working
shoes
claude
wrinkled
his
nose
in
disgust
but
he
took
the
piece
of
green
currant
pie
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
bit
the
acute
angle
from
it
first
rate

he
said
out
of
pure
kindness
of
heart
and
nina
was
radiant
she
would
be
so
if
they
did
work
her
in
the
fields
like
a
horse
he
said
to
himself
as
he
drove
away
the
neighbors
were
well
aware
of
nina
devotion
and
smith
who
lived
two
or
three
houses
down
the
road

claude

hundred
acres
of

in
molasses

it
was
this
innocent
joking
on
his
part
that
started
all
trouble
smith
called

couple
of
days
later
and

joke
with
your
cake
all
dough
why

in

jest
as
much
as
said
he
was
after
the
old
man
acres
well
let
him
have
i
do
know
as
it
interests
me
replied
waving
her
head
like
a
banner
if
he
wants
to
sell
himself
to
that
greasy
dutchwoman
why
let
him
that
all
i
do
care
her
heated
manner
betrayed
her
to
smith
who
laughed
with
huge
enjoyment
well
you
better
watch
out
the
next
day
was
very
warm
and
when
claude
drove
up
under
the
shade
of
the
big
maples
he
was
ready
for
a
chat
while
his
horses
rested
but
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
kennedy
came
out
to
get
the
amount
of
the
skimming
and
started
to
reënter
the
house
without
talk
where
the
young
folks
asked
claude
carelessly
if
you
mean
lucindy
she
in
the
house
ai
sick
or
nothin
is
she
not
that
anybody
knows
of
do
expect
her
to
be
here
to
gass
with
you
every
time
do
ye
well
i
would
mind
replied
claude
he
was
too
keen
not
to
see
his
chance
in
fact
i
like
to
have
her
with
me
all
the
time
kennedy
he
said
with
engaging
frankness
well
you
ca
have
her
the
mother
replied
ungraciously
what
the
matter
with
me
oh
i
like
you
well
enough
but
be
a
big
fool
to
marry
a
man
without
a
roof
to
cover
his
head
that
where
you
take
your
inning
sure
claude
replied
i
not
much
better
than
a
hired
hand
well
now
see
here
i
going
to
make
a
strike
one
of
these
days
and
then
look
out
for
me
you
do
know
but
what
i
invested
in
a
gold
mine
i
may
be
a
dutch
lord
in
disguise
better
not
be
brash
kennedy
sourness
could
not
stand
against
such
sweetness
and
drollery
she
smiled
in
wry
fashion
you
better
be
moving
or
be
late
sure
enough
if
i
only
had
you
for
a
that
why
i
so
poor
nobody
to
keep
me
moving
if
i
had
some
one
to
do
the
talking
for
me
i
work
he
grinned
broadly
and
drove
out
his
irritation
led
him
to
say
some
things
to
nina
which
he
would
not
have
thought
of
saying
the
day
before
she
had
been
working
in
the
field
and
had
dropped
her
hoe
to
see
him
say
nina
i
would
work
outdoors
such
a
day
as
this
if
i
was
you
i
tell
the
old
man
to
go
to
thunder
and
i
go
in
and
wash
up
and
look
decent
yankee
women
do
do
that
kind
of
work
and
your
old
rich
no
use
of
your
sweatin
around
a
with
a
hoe
in
your
hands
i
do
like
to
see
a
woman
goin
round
without
stockin
and
her
hands
all
chapped
and
calloused
it
ai
accordin
to
hoyle
no
sir
i
would
stand
it
i
serve
an
injunction
on
the
old
man
right
now
a
dull
slow
flush
crept
into
the
girl
face
and
she
put
one
hand
over
the
other
as
they
rested
on
the
fence
one
looked
so
much
less
monstrous
than
two
claude
went
on
yes
sir
i
brace
up
and
go
to
yankee
meeting
instead
of
dutch
you
pick
up
a
yankee
beau
like
as
not
he
gathered
his
cream
while
she
stood
silently
by
and
when
he
looked
at
her
again
she
was
in
deep
thought
he
said
cheerily
she
replied
and
her
face
flushed
again
it
rained
that
night
and
the
roads
were
very
bad
and
he
was
late
the
next
time
he
arrived
at
haldeman
nina
came
out
in
her
best
dress
but
he
said
nothing
about
it
supposing
she
was
going
to
town
or
something
like
that
and
he
hurried
through
with
his
task
and
had
mounted
his
seat
before
he
realized
that
anything
was
wrong
then
haldeman
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
and
hurled
a
lot
of
unintelligible
german
at
him
he
knew
she
was
mad
and
mad
at
him
and
also
at
nina
for
she
shook
her
fist
at
them
alternately
singular
to
tell
nina
paid
no
attention
to
her
mother
sputter
she
looked
at
claude
with
a
certain
timid
audacity
how
you
like
me
that
better
he
said
as
he
eyed
her
critically
now
talkin
i
do
a
little
reading
of
the
newspaper
myself
if
i
was
you
a
woman
business
ai
to
work
out
in
the
hot
sun
it
to
cook
and
fix
up
things
round
the
house
and
then
put
on
her
clean
dress
and
set
in
the
shade
and
read
or
sew
on
something
stand
up
to
doggone
me
if
i
paddle
round
that
hot
with
a
mess
o
dutchmen
it
ai
decent
he
drove
off
with
a
chuckle
at
the
old
man
who
was
seated
at
the
back
of
the
house
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
he
was
lame
or
pretended
he
was
and
made
his
wife
and
daughter
wait
upon
him
claude
had
no
conception
of
what
was
working
in
nina
mind
but
he
could
not
help
observing
the
changes
for
the
better
in
her
appearance
each
day
he
called
she
was
neatly
dressed
and
wore
her
shoes
laced
up
to
the
very
top
hook
she
was
passing
through
tribulation
on
his
account
but
she
said
nothing
about
it
the
old
man
her
father
no
longer
spoke
to
her
and
the
mother
sputtered
continually
but
the
girl
seemed
sustained
by
some
inner
power
she
calmly
went
about
doing
as
she
pleased
and
no
fury
of
words
could
check
her
or
turn
her
aside
her
hands
grew
smooth
and
supple
once
more
and
her
face
lost
the
parboiled
look
it
once
had
claude
noticed
all
these
gains
and
commented
on
them
with
the
freedom
of
a
man
who
had
established
friendly
relations
with
a
child
i
tell
you
what
nina
you
coming
along
sure
next
ground
hop
you
be
wearin
silk
stockin
and
shoes
how
the
old
man
still
mad
he
do
speak
to
me
no
more
my
mudder
says
i
am
a
big
fool
she
does
well
you
tell
her
i
think
you
just
getting
sensible
she
smiled
again
and
there
was
a
subtle
quality
in
the
mixture
of
boldness
and
timidity
of
her
manner
his
praise
was
so
sweet
and
stimulating
i
sold
my
pigs
she
said
the
old
man
he
wass
madt
but
i
mind
i
pought
me
a
new
dress
with
the
money
that
right
i
like
to
see
a
woman
have
plenty
of
new
dresses
claude
replied
he
was
really
enjoying
the
girl
rebellion
and
growing
womanliness
meanwhile
his
own
affairs
with
lucindy
were
in
a
bad
way
he
seldom
saw
her
now
smith
was
careful
to
convey
to
her
that
claude
stopped
longer
than
was
necessary
at
haldeman
and
so
kennedy
attended
to
the
matter
of
recording
the
cream
kennedy
himself
was
always
in
the
field
and
claude
had
no
opportunity
for
a
conversation
with
him
as
he
very
much
wished
to
have
once
when
he
saw
in
the
kitchen
at
work
he
left
his
team
to
rest
in
the
shade
and
sauntered
to
the
door
and
looked
in
she
was
kneading
out
cake
dough
and
she
looked
the
loveliest
thing
he
had
ever
seen
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
her
neat
brown
dress
was
covered
with
a
big
apron
and
her
collar
was
open
a
little
at
the
throat
for
it
was
warm
in
the
kitchen
she
frowned
when
she
saw
him
he
began
jocularly
oh
thank
you
i
can
wait
till
it
bakes
no
trouble
at
all
well
it
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
me
to
have
you
standin
there
gappin
at
me
ai
gappin
at
you
i
waitin
for
the
pie
pie
it
cake
oh
well
cake
do
for
a
change
say
do
call
me
well
lucindy
it
mighty
lonesome
when
i
do
see
you
on
my
trips
oh
i
guess
you
can
stand
it
with
nina
to
talk
to
aha
jealous
are
you
jealous
of
that
dutchwoman
i
do
care
who
you
talk
to
and
you
need
think
it
claude
was
learned
in
woman
ways
and
this
pleased
him
mightily
well
when
shall
i
speak
to
your
daddy
i
do
know
what
you
mean
and
i
do
care
oh
yes
you
do
i
going
to
come
up
here
next
sunday
in
my
best
bib
and
tucker
and
i
going
to
say
kennedy
the
sound
of
kennedy
voice
and
footsteps
approaching
made
claude
suddenly
remember
his
duties
see
ye
later
he
said
with
a
grin
i
call
for
the
cake
next
time
call
till
you
split
your
throat
if
you
want
to
said
apparently
this
could
have
gone
on
indefinitely
but
it
did
lucindy
went
to
minneapolis
for
a
few
weeks
to
stay
with
her
brother
and
that
threw
claude
deeper
into
despair
than
anything
kennedy
might
do
or
any
word
lucindy
might
say
it
was
a
dreadful
blow
to
him
to
have
her
pack
up
and
go
so
suddenly
and
without
one
backward
look
at
him
and
besides
he
had
planned
taking
her
to
tyre
on
the
fourth
of
july
kennedy
much
than
the
mother
told
claude
where
she
had
gone
by
mighty
that
a
knock
on
the
nose
for
me
when
did
she
go
yistady
i
took
her
down
to
the
siding
when
she
coming
back
oh
after
the
hot
weather
is
over
four
or
five
weeks
i
hope
i
be
alive
when
she
returns
said
claude
gloomily
naturally
he
had
a
little
more
time
to
give
to
nina
and
her
remarkable
doings
which
had
set
the
whole
neighborhood
to
wondering
what
had
come
over
the
girl
she
no
longer
worked
in
the
field
she
dressed
better
and
had
taken
to
going
to
the
most
fashionable
church
in
town
she
was
as
a
woman
transformed
nothing
was
able
to
prevent
her
steady
progression
and
bloom
she
grew
plumper
and
fairer
and
became
so
much
more
attractive
that
the
young
germans
thickened
round
her
and
one
or
two
yankee
boys
looked
her
way
through
it
all
claude
kept
up
his
banter
and
altogether
serious
daily
advice
without
once
realizing
that
anything
sentimental
connected
him
with
it
all
he
knew
she
liked
him
and
sometimes
he
felt
a
little
annoyed
by
her
attempts
to
please
him
but
that
she
was
doing
all
that
she
did
and
ordering
her
whole
life
to
please
him
never
entered
his
head
there
was
much
room
left
in
that
head
for
any
one
else
except
lucindy
and
his
plans
for
winning
her
plan
as
he
might
he
saw
no
way
of
making
more
than
the
two
dollars
a
day
he
was
earning
as
a
cream
collector
things
ran
along
thus
from
week
to
week
till
it
was
nearly
time
for
lucindy
to
return
claude
was
having
his
top
buggy
repainted
and
was
preparing
for
a
vigorous
campaign
when
lucindy
should
be
at
home
again
he
owned
his
team
and
wagon
and
the
buggy
nothing
more
one
saturday
kennedy
said
lucindy
coming
home
i
going
down
after
her
let
me
bring
her
up
said
claude
with
suspicious
eagerness
kennedy
hesitated
no
i
guess
i
go
myself
i
want
to
go
to
town
anyway
claude
was
in
high
spirits
as
he
drove
into
haldeman
yard
that
afternoon
nina
was
leaning
over
the
fence
singing
softly
to
herself
but
a
fierce
altercation
was
going
on
inside
the
house
the
walls
resounded
it
was
all
dutch
to
claude
but
he
knew
the
old
people
were
quarrelling
nina
smiled
and
colored
as
claude
drew
up
at
the
side
gate
she
seemed
not
to
hear
the
eloquent
discussion
inside
what
going
on
asked
claude
dey
tink
i
am
in
house
how
that
my
mudder

went
on
placidly
she
saidt
dot

goin
to
marry
me
undt
get
the
farm
claude
grinned
then
chuckled
and
at
last
roared
and
whooped
with
the
delight
of
it
he
took
off
his
hat
and
said
she
said
that
did
she
why
bless
her
old
cabbage
head
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
sudden
irruption
of
frau
haldeman
interrupted
him
she
came
rushing
toward
him
like
a
she
grizzly
bear
uttering
a
torrent
of
german
expletives
and
hurled
herself
upon
him
clutching
at
his
hair
and
throat
he
leaped
aside
and
struck
down
her
hands
with
a
sweep
of
his
hard
right
arm
as
she
turned
to
come
again
he
shouted
keep
off
or
i
knock
you
down
but
before
the
blow
came
nina
seized
the
infuriated
woman
from
behind
and
threw
her
down
and
held
her
till
the
old
man
came
hobbling
to
the
rescue
he
seemed
a
little
dazed
by
it
all
and
made
no
effort
to
assault
claude
the
old
woman
who
was
already
black
in
the
face
with
rage
suddenly
fell
limp
and
nina
kneeling
beside
her
grew
white
with
fear
oh
vat
is
the
matter
i
haf
kildt
her
claude
rushed
for
a
bucket
of
water
and
dashed
it
in
the
old
face
he
flooded
her
with
slashings
of
it
especially
after
he
saw
her
open
her
eyes
ending
by
emptying
the
bucket
in
her
face
he
was
a
little
malicious
about
that
the
mother
sat
up
soon
wet
scared
bewildered
gasping
mein
gott
mein
gott
ich
bin
ertrinken
what
does
she
say
she
been
drinkin
well
that
looks
reasonable
no
no
she
thinks
she
is
trouned
oh
drowned
claude
roared
again
not
much
she
ai
she
only
just
getting
cooled
off
he
helped
the
girl
get
her
mother
to
the
house
and
stretch
her
out
on
a
bed
the
old
woman
seemed
to
have
completely
exhausted
herself
with
her
effort
and
submitted
like
a
child
to
be
waited
upon
her
sudden
fainting
had
subdued
her
claude
had
never
penetrated
so
far
into
the
house
before
and
was
much
pleased
with
the
neatness
and
good
order
of
the
rooms
though
they
were
bare
of
furniture
and
carpets
as
the
girl
came
out
with
him
to
the
gate
he
uttered
the
most
serious
word
he
had
ever
had
with
her
now
i
want
you
to
notice
he
said
that
i
did
nothing
to
call
out
the
old
lady
rush
at
me
i
hit
her
sure
if
she
clinched
me
again
i
do
believe
in
striking
a
woman
but
she
was
after
my
hide
for
the
time
bein
and
i
ca
stand
two
such
clutches
in
the
same
place
you
do
blame
me
i
hope
no

the
old
woman

cats
what

that
idea
into
her
head
i
told
her
said
nina
calmly
you
told
her
claude
turned
and
stared
at
her
she
looked
down
and
her
face
slowly
grew
to
a
deep
red
she
moved
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
like
an
awkward
embarrassed
child
as
he
looked
at
her
standing
like
a
culprit
before
him
his
first
impulse
was
to
laugh
he
was
not
specially
refined
but
he
was
a
kindly
man
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
the
girl
was
suffering
well
you
were
mistaken
he
said
at
last
gently
enough
i
do
know
why
you
should
think
so
but
i
never
thought
of
marrying
you
never
thought
of
it
the
flush
faded
from
her
face
and
she
stopped
swaying
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
in
a
tearful
appealing
stare
i
so
you
made
me
so
i
did
how
i
never
said
a
word
to
you
about
liking
you
or
marrying
or
anything
like
that
i
he
was
going
to
tell
her
he
intended
to
marry
lucindy
but
he
checked
himself
her
lashes
fell
again
and
the
tears
began
to
stream
down
her
cheeks
she
knew
the
worst
now
his
face
had
convinced
her
she
could
not
tell
him
the
grounds
of
her
belief
that
every
time
he
had
said
i
like
to
see
a
woman
do
this
or
that
or
i
like
to
see
a
woman
fix
up
around
the
house
she
had
considered
his
words
in
the
light
of
courtship
believing
that
in
such
ways
the
yankees
made
love
so
she
stood
suffering
dumbly
while
he
loaded
his
and
stood
by
the
wheel
ready
to
mount
his
wagon
he
turned
i
mighty
sorry
about
it
he
said
mebbe
i
was
to
blame
i
did
mean
nothing
by
it
not
a
thing
it
was
all
a
mistake
shake
hands
over
it
and
call
the
whole
business
off
he
held
his
hand
out
to
her
and
with
a
low
cry
she
seized
it
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
it
he
started
back
in
amazement
and
drew
his
hand
away
she
fell
upon
her
knees
in
the
path
and
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
while
he
hastily
mounted
his
seat
and
drove
away
nothing
so
profoundly
moving
had
come
into
his
life
since
the
death
of
his
mother
and
as
he
rode
on
down
the
road
he
did
a
great
deal
of
thinking
first
it
gave
him
a
pleasant
sensation
to
think
a
woman
should
care
so
much
for
him
he
had
lived
a
homeless
life
for
years
and
had
come
into
intimate
relations
with
few
women
good
or
bad
they
had
always
laughed
with
him
not
at
him
for
claude
was
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
no
woman
before
had
taken
him
seriously
and
there
was
a
certain
charm
about
the
realization
then
he
fell
to
wondering
what
he
had
said
or
done
to
give
the
girl
such
a
notion
of
his
purposes
perhaps
he
had
been
too
free
with
his
talk
he
was
so
troubled
that
he
hardly
smiled
once
during
the
rest
of
his
circuit
and
at
night
he
refrained
from
going
up
town
and
sat
under
the
trees
back
of
the
creamery
and
smoked
and
pondered
on
the
astounding
situation
he
came
at
last
to
the
resolution
that
it
was
his
duty
to
declare
himself
to
lucindy
and
end
all
uncertainty
so
that
no
other
woman
would
fall
into
nina
error
he
was
as
good
as
an
engaged
man
and
the
world
should
know
it
the
next
day
with
his
newly
painted
buggy
flashing
in
the
sun
and
the
extra
dozen
ivory
rings
he
had
purchased
for
his
harnesses
clashing
together
he
drove
up
the
road
as
a
man
of
leisure
and
a
resolved
lover
it
was
a
beautiful
day
in
august
lucindy
was
getting
a
light
tea
for
some
friends
up
from
the
siding
when
she
saw
claude
drive
up
well
for
the
land
sake
she
broke
out
using
one
of
her
phrases
if
here
is
that
creamery
man
in
that
phrase
lay
the
answer
to
claude
question
if
he
had
heard
it
he
drove
in
and
kennedy
with
impartial
hospitality
went
out
and
asked
him
to
and
put
his
team
in
the
barn
he
did
so
feeling
very
much
exhilarated
he
never
before
had
gone
courting
in
this
direct
and
aboveboard
fashion
he
mistook
the
hospitality
for
compliance
in
his
designs
he
followed
his
host
into
the
house
and
faced
with
very
fair
composure
two
girls
who
smiled
broadly
as
they
shook
hands
with
him
kennedy
gave
him
a
lax
hand
and
a
curt
and
lucindy
fairly
scowled
in
answer
to
his
radiant
smile
she
was
much
changed
he
could
see
she
wore
a
dress
with
puffed
sleeves
and
her
hair
was
dressed
differently
she
seemed
strange
and
distant
but
he
thought
she
was
putting
that
on
for
the
benefit
of
others
at
the
table
the
three
girls
talked
of
things
at
the
siding
and
ignored
him
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
turn
to
farmer
kennedy
for
refuge
he
kept
his
courage
up
by
thinking
wait
till
we
are
alone
after
supper
when
lucindy
explained
that
the
dishes
would
have
to
be
washed
he
offered
to
help
her
in
his
best
manner
thank
you
i
do
need
any
help
was
lucindy
curt
reply
ordinarily
he
was
a
man
of
much
facility
and
ease
in
addressing
women
but
he
was
vastly
disconcerted
by
her
manner
he
sat
rather
silently
waiting
for
the
room
to
clear
when
the
visitors
intimated
that
they
must
go
he
rose
with
cheerful
alacrity
i
get
your
horse
for
you
he
helped
hitch
the
horse
into
the
buggy
and
helped
the
girls
in
with
a
return
of
easy
gallantry
and
watched
them
drive
off
with
joy
at
last
the
field
was
clear
they
returned
to
the
sitting
room
where
the
old
folks
remained
for
a
decent
interval
and
then
left
the
young
people
alone
his
courage
returned
then
and
he
turned
toward
her
with
resolution
in
his
voice
and
eyes
lucindy
he
began
miss
kennedy
please
interrupted
lucindy
with
cutting
emphasis
i
be
darned
if
i
do
he
replied
hotly
what
the
matter
with
you
since
going
to
minneapolis
you
put
on
a
lot
of
city
airs
it
seems
to
me
if
you
do
like
my
airs
you
know
what
you
can
do
he
saw
his
mistake
now
see
here
lucindy
there
no
sense
in
our
quarrelling
i
do
want
to
quarrel
i
do
want
anything
to
do
with
you
i
wish
i
never
seen
you
oh
you
do
mean
that
after
all
the
good
talks
we
had
she
flushed
red
i
never
had
any
such
talks
with
you
he
pursued
his
advantage
oh
yes
you
did
and
you
took
pains
that
i
should
see
you
i
did
no
such
thing
you
came
poking
into
the
kitchen
where
no
business
to
be
say
now
stop
fooling
you
like
me
and
i
do
i
hate
you
and
if
you
do
clear
out
i
call
father
you
one
o
these
kind
o
men
that
think
if
a
girl
looks
at
that
they
want
to
marry
i
tell
you
i
do
want
anything
more
to
do
with
you
and
i
engaged
to
another
man
and
i
wish
you
attend
to
your
own
business
so
there
i
hope
you
satisfied
claude
sat
for
nearly
a
minute
in
silence
then
he
rose
i
guess
right
i
made
a
mistake
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
girl
he
spoke
with
a
curious
hardness
in
his
voice
miss
kennedy
he
went
out
with
dignity
and
in
good
order
his
retreat
was
not
ludicrous
he
left
the
girl
with
the
feeling
that
she
had
lost
her
temper
and
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
uttered
a
lie
he
put
his
horses
to
the
buggy
with
a
mournful
as
he
saw
the
wheels
glisten
he
had
done
all
this
for
a
scornful
girl
who
could
not
treat
him
decently
as
he
drove
slowly
down
the
road
he
mused
deeply
it
was
a
blow
surely
he
was
a
just
man
so
far
as
he
knew
and
as
he
studied
the
situation
over
he
could
not
blame
the
girl
in
the
light
of
her
convincing
wrath
he
comprehended
that
the
sharp
things
she
had
said
to
him
in
the
past
were
not
not
but
real
blows
she
had
not
been
coquetting
with
him
she
had
tried
to
keep
him
away
she
considered
herself
too
good
for
a
hired
man
well
maybe
she
was
anyhow
she
had
gone
out
of
his
reach
hopelessly
as
he
came
past
the
haldemans
he
saw
nina
sitting
out
under
the
trees
in
the
twilight
on
the
impulse
he
pulled
in
his
mind
took
another
turn
here
was
a
woman
who
was
open
and
aboveboard
in
her
affection
her
words
meant
what
they
stood
for
he
remembered
how
she
had
bloomed
out
the
last
few
months
she
has
the
making
of
a
handsome
woman
in
her
he
thought
she
saw
him
and
came
out
to
the
gate
and
while
he
leaned
out
of
his
carriage
she
rested
her
arms
on
the
gate
and
looked
up
at
him
she
looked
pale
and
sad
and
he
was
touched
how
the
old
lady
he
asked
oh
she
up
she
is
much
she
is
veak
and
quiet
quiet
is
she
well
that
good
she
god
strike
her
fer
her
vickedness
never
before
did
she
fainted
like
dot
well
do
spoil
that
notion
in
her
it
may
do
her
a
world
of
good
der
priest
come
he
saidt
it
wass
a
punishment
she
saidt
i
should
marry
who
i
like
claude
looked
at
her
searchingly
she
was
certainly
much
improved
all
she
needed
was
a
little
encouragement
and
advice
and
she
would
make
a
handsome
wife
if
the
old
lady
had
softened
down
her
could
safely
throw
up
the
creamery
job
and
become
the
boss
of
the
farm
the
old
man
was
used
up
and
the
farm
needed
some
one
right
away
he
straightened
up
suddenly
get
your
hat
he
said
and
we
take
a
ride
she
started
erect
and
he
could
see
her
pale
face
glow
with
joy
with
you
with
me
get
your
best
hat
we
may
turn
up
at
the
minister
and
get
married
if
a
sunday
marriage
is
legal
as
she
hurried
up
the
walk
he
said
to
himself
i
bet
it
gives
lucindy
a
shock
and
the
thought
pleased
him
mightily
a
day
pleasure
mainly
it
is
long
and
wearyful
and
has
a
home
of
toil
at
one
end
and
a
dull
little
town
at
the
other
i
when
markham
came
in
from
shovelling
his
last
of
corn
into
the
crib
he
found
that
his
wife
had
put
the
children
to
bed
and
was
kneading
a
batch
of
dough
with
the
dogged
action
of
a
tired
and
sullen
woman
he
slipped
his
soggy
boots
off
his
feet
and
having
laid
a
piece
of
wood
on
top
of
the
stove
put
his
heels
on
it
comfortably
his
chair
squeaked
as
he
leaned
back
on
its
hinder
legs
but
he
paid
no
attention
he
was
used
to
it
exactly
as
he
was
used
to
his
wife
lameness
and
ceaseless
toil
that
closes
up
my
corn
he
said
after
a
silence
i
guess
i
go
to
town
to
git
my
horses
shod
i
guess
i
git
ready
and
go
along
said
his
wife
in
a
sorry
attempt
to
be
firm
and
confident
of
tone
what
do
you
want
to
go
to
town
fer
he
grumbled
what
does
anybody
want
to
go
to
town
fer
she
burst
out
facing
him
i
ai
been
out
o
this
house
fer
six
months
while
you
go
an
go
oh
it
ai
six
months

of

load
of

sack

that
balance

an
the
baby
she
said
spiritedly
all
right
he
replied
seeing
she
was
roused
only
that
wheat
ought
to
be
put
up
if
you
goin
you
wo

any
time
to
hold

the
morning

well
let
go
do
it
then
she
said
sullenly
resolute
i
hate
to
go
out
agin
but
i
we
better
he
yawned
dismally
and
began
pulling
his
boots
on
again
stamping
his
swollen
feet
into
them
with
grunts
of
pain
she
put
on
his
coat
and
one
of
the
boy
caps
and
they
went
out
to
the
granary
the
night
was
cold
and
clear
do
look
so
much
like
snow
as
it
did
last
night
said
sam
it
may
turn
warm
laying
out
the
sacks
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
they
sorted
out
those
which
were
whole
and
sam
climbed
into
the
bin
with
a
tin
pail
in
his
hand
and
the
work
began
he
was
a
sturdy
fellow
and
he
worked
desperately
fast
the
shining
tin
pail
dived
deep
into
the
cold
wheat
and
dragged
heavily
on
the
tired
hands
as
it
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
sack
and
she
trembled
with
fatigue
but
held
on
and
dragged
the
sacks
away
when
filled
and
brought
others
till
at
last
sam
climbed
out
puffing
and
wheezing
to
tie
them
up
i
guess
i
load
in
the
morning
he
said
you
need
wait
fer
me
i
tie
up
alone
oh
i
do
mind
she
replied
feeling
a
little
touched
by
his
unexpectedly
easy
acquiescence
to
her
request
when
they
went
back
to
the
house
the
moon
had
risen
it
had
scarcely
set
when
they
were
wakened
by
the
crowing
roosters
the
man
rolled
stiffly
out
of
bed
and
began
rattling
at
the
stove
in
the
dark
cold
kitchen
his
wife
arose
lamer
and
stiffer
than
usual
and
began
twisting
her
thin
hair
into
a
knot
sam
did
not
stop
to
wash
but
went
out
to
the
barn
the
woman
however
hastily
soused
her
face
into
the
hard
limestone
water
at
the
sink
and
put
the
kettle
on
then
she
called
the
children
she
knew
it
was
early
and
they
would
need
several
callings
she
pushed
breakfast
forward
running
over
in
her
mind
the
things
she
must
have
two
spools
of
thread
six
yards
of
cotton
flannel
a
can
of
coffee
and
mittens
for
kitty
these
she
must
have
there
were
oceans
of
things
she
needed
the
children
soon
came
scudding
down
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
upstairs
to
dress
tumultuously
at
the
kitchen
stove
they
humped
and
shivered
holding
up
their
bare
feet
from
the
cold
floor
like
chickens
in
new
fallen
snow
they
were
irritable
and
snarled
and
snapped
and
struck
like
cats
and
dogs
markham
stood
it
for
a
while
with
mere
commands
to
hush
up
but
at
last
her
patience
gave
out
and
she
charged
down
on
the
struggling
mob
and
cuffed
them
right
and
left
they
ate
their
breakfast
by
lamplight
and
when
sam
went
back
to
his
work
around
the
barnyard
it
was
scarcely
dawn
the
children
left
alone
with
their
mother
began
to
tease
her
to
let
them
go
to
town
also
no
sir
nobody
goes
but
baby
your
father
goin
to
take
a
load
of
wheat
she
was
weak
with
the
worry
of
it
all
when
she
had
sent
the
older
children
away
to
school
and
the
kitchen
work
was
finished
she
went
into
the
cold
bedroom
off
the
little
sitting
room
and
put
on
her
best
dress
it
had
never
been
a
good
fit
and
now
she
was
getting
so
thin
it
hung
in
wrinkled
folds
everywhere
about
the
shoulders
and
waist
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
a
moment
to
ease
that
dull
pain
in
her
back
she
had
a
distaste
for
going
out
at
all
the
thought
of
sleep
was
more
alluring
then
the
thought
of
the
long
long
day
and
the
sickening
sameness
of
her
life
swept
over
her
again
and
she
rose
and
prepared
the
baby
for
the
journey
it
was
but
little
after
sunrise
when
sam
drove
out
into
the
road
and
started
for
belleplain
his
wife
sat
perched
upon
the
behind
him
holding
the
baby
in
her
lap
a
cotton
quilt
under
her
and
a
cotton
over
her
knees
sam
was
disposed
to
be
very
and
he
talked
back
at
her
occasionally
though
she
could
only
understand
him
when
he
turned
his
face
toward
her
the
baby
stared
out
at
the
passing
and
wiggled
his
hands
out
of
his
mittens
at
every
opportunity
he
was
merry
at
least
it
grew
warmer
as
they
went
on
and
a
strong
south
wind
arose
the
dust
settled
upon
the
woman
shawl
and
hat
her
hair
loosened
and
blew
unkemptly
about
her
face
the
road
which
led
across
the
high
level
prairie
was
quite
smooth
and
dry
but
still
it
jolted
her
and
the
pain
in
her
back
increased
she
had
nothing
to
lean
against
and
the
weight
of
the
child
grew
greater
till
she
was
forced
to
place
him
on
the
sacks
beside
her
though
she
could
not
loose
her
hold
for
a
moment
the
town
drew
in
sight
a
cluster
of
small
frame
houses
and
stores
on
the
dry
prairie
beside
a
railway
station
there
were
no
trees
yet
which
could
be
called
shade
trees
the
pitilessly
severe
light
of
the
sun
flooded
everything
a
few
teams
were
hitched
about
and
in
the
lee
of
the
stores
a
few
men
could
be
seen
seated
comfortably
their
broad
flopping
up
and
down
their
faces
brown
as
leather
markham
put
his
wife
out
at
one
of
the
and
drove
off
down
toward
the
elevators
to
sell
his
wheat
the
grocer
greeted
markham
in
a
perfunctorily
kind
manner
and
offered
her
a
chair
which
she
took
gratefully
she
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
almost
without
moving
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
high
chair
at
last
the
child
began
to
get
restless
and
troublesome
and
she
spent
half
an
hour
helping
him
amuse
himself
around
the
at
length
she
rose
and
went
out
on
the
walk
carrying
the
baby
she
went
into
the
store
and
took
a
seat
on
one
of
the
little
revolving
stools
a
woman
was
buying
some
woollen
goods
for
a
dress
it
was
worth
cents
a
yard
the
clerk
said
but
he
would
knock
off
two
cents
if
she
took
ten
yards
it
looked
warm
and
markham
wished
she
could
afford
it
for
mary
a
pretty
young
girl
came
in
and
laughed
and
chatted
with
the
clerk
and
bought
a
pair
of
gloves
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
grocer
her
happiness
made
the
wife
and
mother
sad
when
sam
came
back
she
asked
him
for
some
money
want
you
want
to
do
with
it
he
asked
i
want
to
spend
it
she
said
she
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
so
he
gave
her
a
dollar
i
need
a
dollar
more
well
i
got
to
go
take
up
that
note
at
the
bank
well
the
children
got
to
have
some
new
she
said
he
handed
her
a
bill
and
then
went
out
to
pay
his
note
she
bought
her
cotton
flannel
and
mittens
and
thread
and
then
sat
leaning
against
the
counter
it
was
noon
and
she
was
hungry
she
went
out
to
the
wagon
got
the
lunch
she
had
brought
and
took
it
into
the
grocery
to
eat
it
where
she
could
get
a
drink
of
water
the
grocer
gave
the
baby
a
stick
of
candy
and
handed
the
mother
an
apple
it
kind
o
go
down
with
your
doughnuts
he
said
after
eating
her
lunch
she
got
up
and
went
out
she
felt
ashamed
to
sit
there
any
longer
she
entered
another
store
but
when
the
clerk
came
toward
her
saying
anything
she
answered
no
i
guess
not
and
turned
away
with
foolish
face
she
walked
up
and
down
the
street
desolately
homeless
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
she
knew
no
one
except
the
grocer
she
grew
bitter
as
she
saw
a
couple
of
ladies
pass
holding
their
in
the
latest
city
fashion
another
woman
went
by
pushing
a
baby
carriage
in
which
sat
a
child
just
about
as
big
as
her
own
it
was
bouncing
itself
up
and
down
on
the
long
slender
springs
and
laughing
and
shouting
its
clean
round
face
glowed
from
its
pretty
fringed
hood
she
looked
down
at
the
dusty
clothes
and
grimy
face
of
her
own
little
one
and
walked
on
savagely
she
went
into
the
drug
store
where
the
soda
fountain
was
but
it
made
her
thirsty
to
sit
there
and
she
went
out
on
the
street
again
she
heard
sam
laugh
and
saw
him
in
a
group
of
men
over
by
the
blacksmith
shop
he
was
having
a
good
time
and
had
forgotten
her
her
back
ached
so
intolerably
that
she
concluded
to
go
in
and
rest
once
more
in
the
grocer
chair
the
baby
was
growing
cross
and
fretful
she
bought
five
cents
worth
of
candy
to
take
home
to
the
children
and
gave
baby
a
little
piece
to
keep
him
quiet
she
wished
sam
would
come
it
must
be
getting
late
the
grocer
said
it
was
not
much
after
one
time
seemed
terribly
long
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
do
something
while
she
was
in
town
she
ran
over
her
purchases
yes
that
was
all
she
had
planned
to
buy
she
fell
to
figuring
on
the
things
she
needed
it
was
terrible
it
ran
away
up
into
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
at
the
least
sam
as
well
as
she
needed
underwear
for
the
cold
winter
but
they
would
have
to
wear
the
old
ones
even
if
they
were
thin
and
ragged
she
would
not
need
a
dress
she
thought
bitterly
because
she
never
went
anywhere
she
rose
and
went
out
on
the
street
once
more
and
wandered
up
and
down
looking
at
everything
in
the
hope
of
enjoying
something
a
man
from
boon
creek
backed
a
load
of
apples
up
to
the
sidewalk
and
as
he
stood
waiting
for
the
grocer
he
noticed
markham
and
the
baby
and
gave
the
baby
an
apple
this
was
a
pleasure
he
had
such
a
hearty
way
about
him
he
on
his
part
saw
an
ordinary
farmer
wife
with
dusty
dress
unkempt
hair
and
tired
face
he
did
not
know
exactly
why
she
appealed
to
him
but
he
tried
to
cheer
her
up
the
grocer
was
familiar
with
these
bedraggled
and
weary
wives
he
was
accustomed
to
see
them
sit
for
hours
in
his
big
wooden
chair
and
nurse
tired
and
fretful
children
their
forlorn
aimless
pathetic
wandering
up
and
down
the
street
was
a
daily
occurrence
and
had
never
possessed
any
special
meaning
to
him
ii
in
a
cottage
around
the
corner
from
the
grocery
store
two
men
and
a
woman
were
finishing
a
dainty
luncheon
the
woman
was
dressed
in
cool
white
garments
and
she
seemed
to
make
the
day
one
of
perfect
comfort
the
home
of
the
honorable
hall
was
by
no
means
the
costliest
in
the
town
but
his
wife
made
it
the
most
attractive
he
was
one
of
the
leading
lawyers
of
the
county
and
a
man
of
culture
and
progressive
views
he
was
entertaining
a
friend
who
had
lectured
the
night
before
in
the
congregational
church
they
were
by
no
means
in
serious
discussion
the
talk
was
rather
frivolous
hall
had
the
ability
to
caricature
men
with
a
few
gestures
and
attitudes
and
was
giving
to
his
eastern
friend
some
descriptions
of
the
western
lawyers
he
had
met
in
his
practice
he
was
very
amusing
and
his
guest
laughed
heartily
for
a
time
but
suddenly
hall
became
aware
that
otis
was
not
listening
then
he
perceived
that
he
was
peering
out
of
the
window
at
some
one
and
that
on
his
face
a
look
of
bitter
sadness
was
falling
hall
stopped
what
do
you
see
otis
otis
replied
i
see
a
forlorn
weary
woman
hall
rose
and
went
to
the
window
markham
was
walking
by
the
house
her
baby
in
her
arms
savage
anger
and
weeping
were
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
and
there
was
hopeless
tragedy
in
her
shambling
walk
and
weak
back
in
the
silence
otis
went
on
i
saw
the
poor
dejected
creature
twice
this
morning
i
could
forget
her
who
is
she
asked
hall
very
softly
her
name
is
markham
she
sam
markham
wife
said
hall
the
young
wife
led
the
way
into
the
sitting
room
and
the
men
took
seats
and
lit
their
cigars
hall
was
meditating
a
diversion
when
otis
resumed
suddenly
that
woman
came
to
town
to
get
a
change
to
have
a
little
and
she
wandering
around
like
a
starved
and
weary
cat
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
woman
in
this
town
with
sympathy
enough
and
courage
enough
to
go
out
and
help
that
woman
the
the
politicians
and
the
grocers
make
it
pleasant
for
the
man
so
pleasant
that
he
forgets
his
wife
but
the
wife
is
left
without
a
word
hall
work
dropped
and
on
her
pretty
face
was
a
look
of
pain
the
man
harsh
words
had
wounded
her
and
wakened
her
she
took
up
her
hat
and
hurried
out
on
the
walk
the
men
looked
at
each
other
and
then
the
husband
said
it
going
to
be
a
little
sultry
for
the
men
around
these
diggings
suppose
we
go
out
for
a
walk
delia
felt
a
hand
on
her
arm
as
she
stood
at
the
corner
you
look
tired
markham
wo
you
come
in
a
little
while
mrs
hall
markham
turned
with
a
scowl
on
her
face
and
a
biting
word
on
her
tongue
but
something
in
the
sweet
round
little
face
of
the
other
woman
silenced
her
and
her
brow
smoothed
out
thank
you
kindly
but
it
most
time
to
go
home
i
looking
fer
markham
now
oh
come
in
a
little
while
the
baby
is
cross
and
tired
out
please
do
markham
yielded
to
the
friendly
voice
and
together
the
two
women
reached
the
gate
just
as
two
men
hurriedly
turned
the
other
corner
let
me
relieve
you
said
hall
the
mother
hesitated
he
so
dusty
oh
that
wo
matter
oh
what
a
big
fellow
he
is
i
have
any
of
my
own
said
hall
and
a
look
passed
like
an
electric
spark
between
the
two
women
and
delia
was
her
willing
guest
from
that
moment
they
went
into
the
little
sitting
room
so
dainty
and
lovely
to
the
farmer
wife
and
as
she
sank
into
an
she
was
faint
and
drowsy
with
the
pleasure
of
it
she
submitted
to
being
brushed
she
gave
the
baby
into
the
hands
of
the
swedish
girl
who
washed
its
face
and
hands
and
sang
it
to
sleep
while
its
mother
sipped
some
tea
through
it
all
she
lay
back
in
her
not
speaking
a
word
while
the
ache
passed
out
of
her
back
and
her
hot
swollen
head
ceased
to
throb
but
she
saw
everything
the
piano
the
pictures
the
curtains
the
the
little
they
were
almost
as
grateful
to
her
as
the
food
and
fragrant
tea
such
housekeeping
as
this
she
had
never
seen
her
mother
had
worn
her
kitchen
floor
thin
as
brown
paper
in
keeping
a
speckless
house
and
she
had
been
in
houses
that
were
larger
and
costlier
but
something
of
the
charm
of
her
hostess
was
in
the
arrangement
of
vases
chairs
or
pictures
it
was
tasteful
hall
did
not
ask
about
her
affairs
she
talked
to
her
about
the
sturdy
little
baby
and
about
the
things
upon
which
delia
eyes
dwelt
if
she
seemed
interested
in
a
vase
she
was
told
what
it
was
and
where
it
was
made
she
was
shown
all
the
pictures
and
books
hall
seemed
to
read
her
visitor
mind
she
kept
as
far
from
the
farm
and
her
affairs
as
possible
and
at
last
she
opened
the
piano
and
sang
to
her
not
hymns
but
catchy
full
of
sentiment
and
then
played
some
simple
melodies
knowing
that
markham
eyes
were
studying
her
hands
her
rings
and
the
flash
of
her
fingers
on
the
keys
seeing
more
than
she
heard
and
through
it
all
hall
conveyed
the
impression
that
she
too
was
having
a
good
time
the
rattle
of
the
wagon
outside
roused
them
both
sam
was
at
the
gate
for
her
markham
rose
hastily
oh
it
almost
sundown
she
gasped
in
astonishment
as
she
looked
out
of
the
window
oh
that
wo
kill
anybody
replied
her
hostess
do
hurry
carrie
take
the
baby
out
to
the
wagon
for
markham
while
i
help
her
with
her
things
oh
i
had
such
a
good
time
markham
said
as
they
went
down
the
little
walk
so
have
i
replied
hall
she
took
the
baby
a
moment
as
her
guest
climbed
in
oh
you
big
fat
fellow
she
cried
as
she
gave
him
a
squeeze
you
must
bring
your
wife
in
oftener
markham
she
said
as
she
handed
the
baby
up
sam
was
staring
with
amazement
thank
you
i
will
he
finally
managed
to
say
said
markham
dear
called
hall
and
the
wagon
began
to
rattle
off
the
tenderness
and
sympathy
in
her
voice
brought
the
tears
to
eyes
not
hot
nor
bitter
tears
but
tears
that
cooled
her
eyes
and
cleared
her
mind
the
wind
had
gone
down
and
the
red
sunlight
fell
mistily
over
the
world
of
corn
and
stubble
the
crickets
were
still
chirping
and
the
feeding
cattle
were
drifting
toward
the
farmyards
the
day
had
been
made
beautiful
by
human
sympathy
ripley
trip
and
in
winter
the
winds
sweep
the
snows
across
it
the
night
was
in
windy
november
and
the
blast
threatening
rain
roared
around
the
poor
little
shanty
of
uncle
ripley
set
like
a
on
the
vast
iowa
prairie
uncle
ethan
was
mending
his
old
violin
with
many
york
state
dums
and
i
gol
darns
totally
oblivious
of
his
tireless
old
wife
who
having
finished
the
sat
knitting
a
stocking
evidently
for
the
little
grandson
who
lay
before
the
stove
like
a
cat
neither
of
the
old
people
wore
glasses
and
their
light
was
a
tallow
candle
they
could
afford
none
o
them
lamps
the
room
was
small
the
chairs
were
wooden
and
the
walls
bare
a
home
where
poverty
was
a
guest
the
old
lady
looked
pathetically
little
weazened
and
hopeless
in
her
garments
whose
original
color
had
long
since
vanished
intent
as
she
was
on
the
stocking
in
her
knotted
stiffened
fingers
and
there
was
a
peculiar
sparkle
in
her
little
black
eyes
and
an
unusual
resolution
in
the
straight
line
of
her
withered
and
shapeless
lips
suddenly
she
paused
stuck
a
needle
in
the
spare
knob
of
her
hair
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
looking
at
ripley
said
decisively

there
was
a
note
in
the
old
woman
voice
that
brought
genuine
stupefaction
into
the
face
of
uncle
ripley
of
course
in
this
case
as
in
all
others
the
money

was
uppermost

with

i
went
to
a
picnic
i
had
to
come
home
an
milk
get
supper
for
you
i
been
away
t
stay
overnight
for
thirteen
years
in
this
house
it
was
just
so
in
davis
county
for
ten
more
for
years
ethan
ripley
i
stuck
right
to
the
stove
an
churn
without
a
day
or
a
night
off
her
voice
choked
again
but
she
rallied
and
continued
impressively
and
now
i
back
to
yaark
state
ethan
was
vanquished
he
stared
at
her
in
speechless
surprise
his
jaw
hanging
it
was
incredible
for
years
she
went
on
musingly
i
just
about
promised
myself
every
year
i
go
back
an
see
my
folks
she
was
distinctly
talking
to
herself
now
and
her
voice
had
a
touching
wistful
cadence
i
wanted
to
go
back
an
see
the
old
folks
an
the
hills
where
we
played
an
eat
apples
off
the
old
tree
down
by
the
well
had
them
trees
an
hills
in
my
mind
days
and
days
nights
too
an
the
girls
i
used
to
know
an
my
own
folks
she
fell
into
a
silent
muse
which
lasted
so
long
that
the
ticking
of
the
clock
grew
loud
as
the
gong
in
the
man
ears
and
the
wind
outside
seemed
to
sound
drearier
than
usual
he
returned
to
the
money
problem
kindly
though
but
how
y
goin
t
raise
the
money
i
ai
got
no
extra
cash
this
time
agin
roach
is
paid
an
the
interest
paid
we
ai
got
no
hundred
dollars
to
spare
jane
not
by
a
jugful
wal
do
you
lay
awake
nights
studyin
on
where
i
to
get
the
money
said
the
old
woman
taking
delight
in
mystifying
him
she
had
him
now
and
he
could
escape
he
strove
to
show
his
indifference
however
by
playing
a
tune
or
two
on
the
violin
come
tukey
you
better
climb
the
wooden
hill
ripley
said
a
later
to
the
little
chap
on
the
floor
who
was
beginning
to
get
drowsy
under
the
influence
of
his
grandpa
fiddling
pa
you
had
orta
put
that
string
in
the
clock
on
the
side
the
string
is
broke
she
said
upon
returning
from
the
boy
bedroom
i
orta
git
up
early
to
git
some
sewin
done
land
knows
i
ca
fix
up
much
but
they
is
a
little
i
do
i
want
to
look
decent
they
were
alone
now
and
they
both
sat
expectantly
you
to
think
mother
that
i
agin
yer
goin
wal
it
would
kinder
seem
as
if
y
had
hustled
yerself
any
t
help
me
git
off
he
was
smarting
under
the
sense
of
being
wronged
wal
i
just
as
willin
you
should
go
as
i
am
for
myself
but
if
i
ai
got
no
money
i
do
see
how
i
goin
to
send
i
do
want
ye
to
send
nobody
ast
ye
to
ethan
ripley
i
guess
if
i
had
what
i
earnt
since
we
came
on
this
farm
i
have
enough
to
go
to
jericho
with
you
got
as
much
out
of
it
as
i
have
he
replied
gently
you
talk
about
your
goin
back
ai
i
been
wantin
to
go
back
myself
and
i
kep
still
i
see
it
no
use
i
guess
i
worked
jest
as
long
and
as
hard
as
you
an
in
storms
an
in
mud
an
heat
ef
it
comes
t
that
the
woman
was
staggered
but
she
would
give
up
she
must
get
in
one
more
thrust
wal
if
you
managed
as
well
as
i
have
you
have
some
money
to
go
with
and
she
rose
and
went
to
mix
her
bread
and
set
it
raisin
he
sat
by
the
fire
twanging
his
fiddle
softly
he
was
plainly
thrown
into
gloomy
retrospection
something
quite
unusual
for
him
but
his
fingers
picking
out
the
bars
of
a
familiar
tune
set
him
to
smiling
and
whipping
his
bow
across
the
strings
he
forgot
all
about
his
resolutions
and
his
own
hardships
trouble
always
slid
off
his
back
like
punkins
off
a
haystack
anyway
his
wife
said
the
old
man
still
sat
fiddling
softly
after
his
wife
disappeared
in
the
hot
and
stuffy
little
bedroom
off
the
kitchen
his
shaggy
head
bent
lower
over
his
violin
he
heard
her
shoes
drop
one
two
pretty
soon
she
called
come
put
up
that
squeakin
old
fiddle
and
go
to
bed
seems
as
if
you
orta
have
sense
enough
not
to
set
there
keepin
everybody
in
the
house
awake
you
hush
up
retorted
he
i
come
when
i
git
ready
and
not
till
i
be
glad
when
you
gone
yes
i
warrant
that
with
which
amiable
they
went
off
to
sleep
or
at
least
she
did
while
he
lay
awake
pondering
on
where
under
the
sun
she
was
t
raise
that
money
the
next
day
she
was
up
bright
and
early
working
away
on
her
own
affairs
ignoring
ripley
entirely
the
fixed
look
of
resolution
still
on
her
little
old
wrinkled
face
she
killed
a
hen
and
dressed
and
baked
it
she
fried
up
a
pan
of
doughnuts
and
made
a
cake
she
was
engaged
in
the
doughnuts
when
a
neighbor
came
in
one
of
these
women
who
take
it
as
a
personal
affront
when
any
one
in
the
neighborhood
does
anything
without
asking
their
advice
she
was
fat
and
could
talk
a
man
blind
in
three
minutes
by
the
watch
her
neighbor
said
what
this
i
hear
mis
ripley
i
dun
know
i
expect
you
hear
about
all
they
is
goin
on
in
this
neighborhood
replied
ripley
with
crushing
bluntness
but
the
gossip
did
not
flinch
well
sett
turner
told
me
that
her
husband
told
her
that
ripley
told
him
this
mornin
that

anxious
to

as
we
be
here
doudney
paused
for
breath
she
had
walked
so
fast
and
had
rested
so
little
that
her
interminable
flow
of
ses
i
and
ses
he
ceased
necessarily
she
had
reached
moreover
the
point
of
most
vital
interest
the
money
an
you
find
out
jest
as
soon
as
he
does
was
the
dry
response
from
the
figure
hovering
over
the
stove
and
with
all
her
manœuvring
that
was
all
she
got
all
day
ripley
went
about
his
work
exceedingly
thoughtful
for
him
it
was
cold
blustering
weather
the
wind
rustled
among
the
with
a
wild
and
mournful
sound
the
geese
and
ducks
went
sprawling
down
the
wind
and
the
horses
coats
were
ruffled
and
backs
raised
the
old
man
was
husking
all
alone
in
the
field
his
spare
form
rigged
out
in
two
or
three
ragged
coats
his
hands
inserted
in
a
pair
of
gloves
minus
nearly
all
the
fingers
his
thumbs
done
up
in
stalls
and
his
feet
thrust
into
huge
coarse
boots
the
down
ears
wet
and
chapped
his
hands
already
worn
to
the
quick
toward
night
it
grew
colder
and
threatened
snow
in
spite
of
all
these
attacks
he
kept
his
cheerfulness
and
though
he
was
very
tired
he
was
softened
in
temper
having
plenty
of
time
to
think
matters
over
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
old
woman
needed
a
i
ai
likely
to
be
no
richer
next
year
than
i
am
this
one
if
i
wait
till
i
able
to
send
her
she
wo
never
go
i
i
git
enough
out
o
them
shoats
to
send
her
i
kind
a
lotted
on
them
pigs
done
up
in
sassengers
but
if
the
ol
woman
goes
east
tukey
an
me
kind
a
haff
to
pull
through
without
we
have
a
turkey
thanksgivin
an
a
chicken
once
a
while
lord
but
we
miss
the
gravy
on
the
flapjacks
he
smacked
his
lips
over
the
thought
of
the
lost
dainty
but
let
rip
we
can
stand
it
then
there
is
my
buffalo
overcoat
i
kind
a
on
havin
a
buffalo
but
that
gone
up
the
spout
along
with
them
sassengers
these
heroic
sacrifices
having
been
determined
upon
he
put
them
into
effect
at
once
this
he
was
able
to
do
for
his
ran
alongside
the
road
leading
to
cedarville
and
his
neighbors
were
passing
almost
all
hours
of
the
day
it
would
have
softened
jane
ripley
heart
could
she
have
seen
his
bent
and
stiffened
form
among
the
the
cold
wind
piercing
to
the
bone
through
his
threadbare
and
insufficient
clothing
the
rising
wind
sent
the
snow
rattling
among
the
moaning
stalks
at
intervals
the
cold
made
his
poor
dim
eyes
water
and
he
had
to
stop
now
and
then
to
swing
his
arms
about
his
chest
to
warm
them
his
voice
was
hoarse
with
shouting
at
the
shivering
team
that
night
as
ripley
was
clearing
the
dishes
away
she
got
to
thinking
about
the
departure
of
the
next
day
and
she
began
to
soften
she
gave
way
to
a
few
tears
when
little
tewksbury
gilchrist
her
grandson
came
up
and
stood
beside
her
you
ai
goin
to
stay
away
always
are
yeh
why
course
not
tukey
what
made
y
think
that
well

o
look
if
yeh

mad
well
i
ai

ai
never

all
my
folks

there
sonny
an

s
poor
all
these
years
i
could
seem
t
never
git
started
now
when
i
ready
t
go
i
feel
kind
a
queer
if
i
cry
and
cry
she
did
while
little
tewksbury
stood
patting
her
trembling
hands
hearing
ripley
step
on
the
porch
she
rose
hastily
and
drying
her
eyes
plunged
at
the
work
again
ripley
came
in
with
a
big
armful
of
wood
which
he
rolled
into
the
with
a
thundering
crash
then
he
pulled
off
his
mittens
slapped
them
together
to
knock
off
the
ice
and
snow
and
laid
them
side
by
side
under
the
stove
he
then
removed
cap
coat
blouse
and
finally
his
boots
which
he
laid
upon
the
the
soles
turned
toward
the
as
he
sat
down
without
speaking
he
opened
the
front
doors
of
the
stove
and
held
the
palms
of
his
stiffened
hands
to
the
blaze
the
light
brought
out
a
thoughtful
look
on
his
large
uncouth
yet
kindly
visage
life
had
laid
hard
lines
on
his
brown
skin
but
it
had
not
entirely
soured
a
naturally
kind
and
simple
nature
it
had
made
him
penurious
and
dull
and
had
stifled
all
the
slender
flowers
of
his
nature
yet
there
was
warm
soil
somewhere
hid
in
his
heart
it
snowin
like
all
he
remarked
finally
i
guess
have
a
i
t
drive
y
daown
in
scrumptious
style
if
yeh
must
leave
why
we
give
yeh

whoopin

tukey
nobody
replying
he
waited
a
moment
i
ben
things
over
kind

t
the
conclusion
that
we
have
been
kind
o

she

appear
to
be
listening
but
she
was
and
he
did
appear
on
his
part
to
be
talking
to
her
and
he
kept
his
voice
as
hard
and
dry
as
he
could
an
i
was
tellin
tukey
that
it
was
a
dum
shame
our
crops

when

broke
down
and
with
her
hands
all
wet
with
as
they
were
covered
her
face
and
sobbed
she
felt
like
kissing
him
but
she
did
tewksbury
began
to
whimper
too
but
the
old
man
was
astonished
his
wife
had
not
wept
for
years
before
him
he
rose
and
walking
clumsily
up
to
her
timidly
touched
her
hair
why

hatfield

hopped
up
and
dashed
into
the
bedroom
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
a
yarn
mitten
tied
around
the
wrist
which
she
laid
on
the
table
with
a
thump
saying

ripley
gave
it
up
in
despair
he
did
realize
fully
enough
how
the
proposed
trip
had
unsettled
his
wife
nerves
she
did
realize
it
herself
as

and
that
ended
it
they
were
a
familiar
sight
as
they
rode
down
the
road
toward
town
next
day
as
usual
ripley
sat
up
straight
and
stiff
as
a
wedge
in
a
log
the
day
was
cold
and
raw
there
was
some
snow
on
the
ground
but
not
enough
to
warrant
the
use
of
sleighs
it
was
neither
sleddin
nor
wheelin
the
old
people
sat
on
a
board
laid
across
the
box
and
had
an
old
quilt
or
two
drawn
up
over
their
knees
tewksbury
lay
in
the
back
part
of
the
box
which
was
filled
with
hay
where
he
jounced
up
and
down
in
company
with
a
queer
old
trunk
and
a
there
is
no
ride
quite
so
desolate
and
uncomfortable
as
a
ride
in
a
on
a
cold
day
in
autumn
when
the
ground
is
frozen
and
the
wind
is
strong
and
raw
with
threatening
snow
the
grind
along
in
the
snow
the
cold
gets
in
under
the
seat
at
the
calves
of
one
legs
and
the
ceaseless
bumping
of
the
bottom
of
the
box
on
the
feet
is
almost
intolerable
there
was
not
much
talk
on
the
way
down
and
what
little
there
was
related
mainly
to
certain
domestic
regulations
to
be
strictly
followed
regarding
churning
pickles
pancakes
etc
ripley
wore
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
carried
her
queer
little
black
bonnet

her
hand

wrapped
in
a
shawl
the
boy

were
pounding
together

the
time

reached
cedarville

every
muscle
ached
with
the
fatigue
of
shaking
after
a
few
purchases
they
drove
down
to
the
station
a
frightful
little
den
common
in
the
west

always
too
hot

cold

bright
day
stacey
who
lives
about
two
miles
from
cedarville
looking
out
of
the
window
saw
a
queer
little
figure
struggling
along
the
road
which
was
blocked
here
and
there
with
drifts
it
was
an
old
woman
laden
with
a
good
parcels
which
the
wind
seemed
determined
to
wrench
from
her
she
was
dressed
in
black
with
a
full
skirt
and
her
cloak
being
short
the
wind
had
excellent
opportunity
to
inflate
her
garments
and
sail
her
off
occasionally
into
the
deep
snow
outside
the
track
but
she
held
out
bravely
till
she
reached
the
gate
as
she
turned
in
stacey
cried
why

ripley
he
want
his
supper
on
time
and
off
up
the
road
the
indomitable
little
figure
trudged
head
held
down
to
the
cutting
blast
little
a
speck
on
a
measureless
expanse
crawling
along
with
painful
breathing
and
slipping
sliding
steps
gittin
home
to
ripley
an
the
boy
ripley
was
out
to
the
barn
when
she
entered
but
tewksbury
was
building
a
fire
in
the
old
he
sprang
up
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
ran
to
her
she
seized
him
and
kissed
him
and
it
did
her
so
much
good
she
hugged
him
close
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
crying
hysterically
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
we
had
an
awful
time
since
you
been
gone
she
released
him
and
looked
around
a
lot
of
dirty
dishes
were
on
the
table
the
was
a
sight
to
behold
as
she
afterward
said
and
so
was
the
stove
all
over
the
splotches
of
pancake
batter
all
over
the
stove
wal
i
sh
say
as
much
she
dryly
assented
untying
her
when
ripley
came
in
she
had
her
regimentals
on
the
stove
was
brushed
the
room
swept
and
she
was
in
the
hullo
mother
got
back
hev
yeh
i
sh
say
it
was
about
time
she
replied
curtly
without
looking
up
or
ceasing
work
has
ol
dried
up
yit
this
was
her
greeting
her
trip
was
a
fact
now
no
chance
could
rob
her
of
it
she
had
looked
forward
years
toward
it
and
now
she
could
look
back
at
it
accomplished
she
took
up
her
burden
again
never
more
thinking
to
lay
it
down
uncle
ethan
ripley
like
the
road
of
life
it
is
traversed
by
many
classes
of
people
uncle
ethan
had
a
theory
that
a
man
character
could
be
told
by
the
way
he
sat
in
a
wagon
seat
a
mean
man
sets
right
plumb
in
the
middle
o
the
seat
as
much
as
to
say
gol
darn
yeh
who
cares
but
a
man
that
sets
in
the
corner
o
the
seat
much
as
to
say
in
cheaper
t
ride
to
walk
you
can
jest
tie
to
uncle
ripley
was
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
stranger
therefore
before
he
came
opposite
the
potato
patch
where
the
old
man
was
bugging
his
vines
the
stranger
drove
a
pair
of
calico
ponies
hitched
to
a
clattering
democrat
wagon
and
he
sat
on
the
extreme
end
of
the
seat
with
the
lines
in
his
right
hand
while
his
left
rested
on
his
thigh
with
his
little
finger
gracefully
crooked
and
his
elbows
akimbo
he
wore
a
blue
shirt
with
armlets
just
above
the
elbows
and
his
vest
hung
unbuttoned
down
his
lank
ribs
it
was
plain
he
was
well
pleased
with
himself
as
he
pulled
up
and
threw
one
leg
over
the
end
of
the
seat
uncle
ethan
observed
that
the
left
spring
was
much
more
worn
than
the
other
which
proved
that
it
was
not
accidental
but
that
it
was
the
driver
habit
to
sit
on
that
end
of
the
seat
good
afternoon
said
the
stranger
pleasantly
good
afternoon
sir
bugs
purty
plenty
plenty
enough
i
gol
i
do
see
where
they
all
come
fum
early
rose
inquired
the
man
as
if
referring
to
the
bugs
no
peachblows
an
carter
reds
my
early
rose
is
over
near
the
house
the
old
woman
wants
near
see
the
darned
things
he
pursued
rapping
savagely
on
the
edge
of
the
pan
to
rattle
the
bugs
back
how
do
yeh
kill
scald
mostly
sometimes
i
good
piece
of
oats
yawned
the
stranger
listlessly
that
barley
so
is
did
notice
uncle
ethan
was
wondering
who
the
man
was
he
had
some
pots
of
black
paint
in
the
wagon
and
two
or
three
square
boxes
what
do
yeh
think
o
cleveland
chances
for
a
second
term
continued
the
man
as
if
they
had
been
talking
politics
all
the
while
uncle
ripley
scratched
his
head
waal
i
dunno
bein
a
republican
i
think
that
so
it
a
purty
scaly
outlook
i
do
believe
in
second
terms
myself
the
man
hastened
to
say
is
that
your
new
barn
acrosst
there
he
asked
pointing
with
his
whip
yes
sir
it
is
replied
the
old
man
proudly
after
years
of
planning
and
hard
work
he
had
managed
to
erect
a
little
wooden
barn
costing
possibly
three
hundred
dollars
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
he
took
a
childish
pride
in
the
fact
of
its
newness
the
stranger
mused
a
lovely
place
for
a
sign
he
said
as
his
eyes
wandered
across
its
shining
yellow
broadside
uncle
ethan
stared
unmindful
of
the
bugs
crawling
over
the
edge
of
his
pan
his
interest
in
the
pots
of
paint
deepened
could
think
o
lettin
me
paint
a
sign
on
that
barn
the
stranger
continued
putting
his
locked
hands
around
one
knee
and
gazing
away
across
the
at
the
building
what
kind
of
a
sign
gol
darn
your
skins
uncle
ethan
pounded
the
pan
with
his
paddle
and
scraped
two
or
three
crawling
abominations
off
his
leathery
wrist
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
the
man
in
the
wagon
seemed
unusually
loath
to
attend
to
business
the
tired
ponies
slept
in
the
shade
of
the
lombardies
the
plain
was
draped
in
a
warm
mist
and
shadowed
by
vast
vaguely
defined
masses
of
clouds
a
lazy
june
day
dodd
family
bitters
said
the
man
waking
out
of
his
abstraction
with
a
start
and
resuming
his
working
manner
the
best
bitter
in
the
market
he
alluded
to
it
in
the
singular
like
to
look
at
it
no
trouble
to
show
goods
as
the
fellah
says
he
went
on
hastily
seeing
uncle
ethan
hesitation
he
produced
a
large
bottle
of
triangular
shape
like
a
bottle
for
pickled
onions
it
had
a
red
seal
on
top
and
a
strenuous
caution
in
red
letters
on
the
neck
none
genuine
unless
family
bitters
is
blown
in
the
bottom
here
what
it
cures
pursued
the
agent
pointing
at
the
side
where
in
an
inverted
pyramid
the
names
of
several
hundred
diseases
were
arranged
running
from
gout
to
pulmonary
complaints
etc
i
gol
she
cuts
a
wide
swath
do
she
exclaimed
uncle
ethan
profoundly
impressed
with
the
list
they
ai
no
better
bitter
in
the
world
said
the
agent
with
a
conclusive
inflection
what
its
most
of
have
some
well
summer
complaints
an
an
spring
an
fall
troubles
tones
ye
up
sort
of
uncle
ethan
forgotten
pan
was
empty
of
his
gathered
bugs
he
was
deeply
interested
in
this
man
there
was
something
he
liked
about
him
what
does
it
sell
fur
he
asked
after
a
pause
same
price
as
them
cheap
medicines
dollar
a
bottle
big
bottles
too
want
one
wal
mother
ai
to
home
an
i
do
know
as
she
like
this
kind
we
ai
been
sick
years
still
they
no
tellin
he
added
seeing
the
answer
to
his
objection
in
the
agent
eyes
times
is
purty
close
too
with
us
y
see
we
jest
built
that
stable
say
i
tell
yeh
what
i
do
said
the
stranger
waking
up
and
speaking
in
a
warmly
generous
tone
i
give
you
ten
bottles
of
the
bitter
if
you
let
me
paint
a
sign
on
that
barn
it
wo
hurt
the
barn
a
bit
and
if
you
want
you
can
paint
it
out
a
year
from
date
come
what
d
say
i
guess
i
had
better
the
agent
thought
that
uncle
ethan
was
after
more
pay
but
in
reality
he
was
thinking
of
what
his
little
old
wife
would
say
it
simply
puts
a
family
bitter
in
your
home
that
may
save
you
fifty
dollars
this
comin
fall
you
ca
tell
just
what
the
man
said
after
that
uncle
ethan
did
follow
his
voice
had
a
confidential
purring
sound
as
he
stretched
across
the
and
talked
on
eyes
half
shut
he
straightened
up
at
last
and
concluded
in
the
tone
of
one
who
has
carried
his
point
so
if
you
did
want
to
use
the
whole
bottles
why
sell
it
to
your
neighbors
you
can
get
twenty
dollars
out
of
it
easy
and
still
have
five
bottles
of
the
best
family
bitter
that
ever
went
into
a
bottle
it
was
the
thought
of
this
opportunity
to
get
a
coat
that
consoled
uncle
ethan
as
he
saw
the
hideous
black
letters
appearing
under
the
agent
lazy
brush
it
was
the
hot
side
of
the
barn
and
painting
was
no
light
work
the
agent
was
forced
to
mop
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
say
hai
got
a
cooky
or
anything
and
a
cup
o
milk
handy
he
said
at
the
end
of
the
first
enormous
word
which
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
barn
uncle
ethan
got
him
the
milk
and
cooky
which
he
ate
with
an
exaggeratedly
dainty
action
of
his
fingers
seated
meanwhile
on
the
staging
which
uncle
ripley
had
helped
him
to
build
this
lunch
infused
new
energy
into
him
and
in
a
short
time
dodd
family
bitters
best
in
the
market
disfigured
the
pine
boards
ethan
was
eating
his
supper
of
bread
and
milk
when
his
wife
came
home
who
been
on
that
barn
she
demanded
her
eyes
flashing
her
withered
little
face
set
in
an
ominous
frown
ethan
ripley
what
you
been
doin
nawthin
he
replied
feebly
who
painted
that
sign
on
there
a
man
come
along
an
he
wanted
to
paint
that
on
there
and
i
let
and
it
my
barn
anyway
i
guess
i
can
do
what
i
a
min
to
with
it
he
ended
defiantly
but
his
eyes
wavered
ripley
ignored
the
defiance
what
under
the
sun
you
to
do
such
a
thing
as
that
ethan
ripley
i
declare
i
do
see
you
git
fooler
an
fooler
day
you
live
i
do
believe
uncle
ethan
attempted
a
defence
wal
he
paid
me
dollars
it
anyway
did
she
was
visibly
affected
by
this
news
wal
anyhow
it
amounts
to
that
he
give
me
bottles
ripley
sank
back
in
her
chair
wal
i
swan
to
bungay
ethan
ripley
wal
you
beat
all
i
ever
see
she
added
in
despair
of
expression
i
thought
you
had
some
sense
left
but
you
hai
not
one
blessed
scimpton
where
is
the
stuff
down
cellar
an
you

that
ten
dollars

illustrated
bible

an
bring
that
stuff
up
here
i
never
see
such
a
man
in
my
life
it
a
wonder
he
did
do
it
two
bottles
she
glared
out
at
the
sign
which
faced
directly
upon
the
kitchen
window
uncle
ethan
tugged
the
two
cases
up
and
set
them
down
on
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
ripley
opened
a
bottle
and
smelled
of
it
like
a
cautious
cat
ugh
merciful
sakes
what
stuff
it
ai
fit
a
hog
to
take
you
think
you
was
goin
to
do
with
it
she
asked
in
poignant
disgust
i
expected
to
take
it
if
i
was
sick
whaddy
ye
he
defiantly
stood
his
ground
towering
above
her
like
a
leaning
tower
the
hull
cartload
of
it
no
i
goin
to
sell
part
of
it
an
git
me
an
overcoat

it
she
shouted
nobuddy

that
stuff
but
an
old
numskull
like
you

that
slop
out
o
the
house
this
minute
take
it
right
down
to
the
an
smash
every
bottle
on
the
stones
uncle
ethan
and
the
cases
of
medicine
disappeared
and
the
old
woman
addressed
her
concluding
remarks
to
little
tewksbury
her
grandson
who
stood
timidly
on
one
leg
in
the
doorway
like
an
intruding
pullet
everything
around
this
place
go
to
rack
an
ruin
if
i
did
keep
a
watch
on
that
old
dummy
i
thought
that
man
had
give
him
a
lesson
he
remember
but
no
he
must
go
an
make
a
she
subsided
in
a
tumult
of
banging
pans
which
helped
her
out
in
the
matter
of
expression
and
reduced
her
to
a
grim
sort
of
quiet
uncle
ethan
went
about
the
house
like
a
convict
on
shipboard
once
she
caught
him
looking
out
of
the
window
i
should
think
you
feel
proud
o
that
uncle
ethan
had
never
been
sick
a
day
in
his
life
he
was
bent
and
bruised
with
toil
but
he
had
nothing
especial
the
matter
with
him
he
did
not
smash
the
medicine
as
ripley
commanded
because
he
had
determined
to
sell
it
the
next
sunday
morning
after
his
chores
were
done
he
put
on
his
best
coat
of
faded
diagonal
and
was
brushing
his
hair
into
a
ridge
across
the
centre
of
his
high
narrow
head
when
ripley
came
in
from
feeding
the
calves
where
you
goin
now
none
o
your
business
he
replied
it
darn
funny
if
i
ca
stir
without
you
wantin
to
know
all
about
it
where
tukey
feedin
the
chickens

to

mornin

nothin
about

him
off
wal

off
an
if
y
ai
here
dinner
i
ai
to
get
no
supper
ripley
took
a
and
put
four
bottles
of
the
bitter
into
it
and
trudged
away
up
the
road
with
it
in
a
pleasant
glow
of
hope
all
nature
seemed
to
declare
the
day
a
time
of
rest
and
invited
men
to
disassociate
ideas
of
toil
from
the
rustling
green
wheat
shining
grass
and
tossing
blooms
something
of
the
sweetness
and
buoyancy
of
all
nature
permeated
the
old
man
body
and
he
whistled
little
snatches
of
the
dance
tunes
he
played
on
his
fiddle
but
he
found
neighbor
johnson
to
be
supplied
with
another
variety
of
bitter
which
was
all
he
needed
for
the
present
he
qualified
his
refusal
to
buy
with
a
cordial
invitation
to
go
out
and
see
his
shoats
in
which
he
took
infinite
pride
but
uncle
ripley
said
i
guess
haf
t
be
goin
i
want
git
up
to
jennings
before
dinner
he
could
help
feeling
a
little
depressed
when
he
found
jennings
away
the
next
house
along
the
pleasant
lane
was
inhabited
by
a
newcomer
he
was
sitting
on
the
holding
a
horse
halter
while
his
hired
man
dashed
cold
water
upon
the
galled
spot
on
the
shoulder
after
some
preliminary
talk
ripley
presented
his
medicine
hell
no
what
do
i
want
of
such
stuff
when
they
anything
the
matter
with
me
i
take
a
lunkin
ol
swig
of
and
bourbon
that
fixes
me
uncle
ethan
moved
off
up
the
lane
he
hardly
felt
like
whistling
now
at
the
next
house
he
set
his
pail
down
in
the
weeds
beside
the
fence
and
went
in
without
it
doudney
came
to
the
door
in
his
bare
feet
buttoning
his
suspenders
over
a
clean
boiled
shirt
he
was
dressing
to
go
out
hello
ripley
i
was
just
goin
down
your
way

minute

uncle
ethan
straightened
up
and
his
face
lighted
doudney
went
on
yes

bitter
that
ever
went
into
a
bottle
i

ripley
glanced
up
at
doudney
new
granary
and
there
read
dodd
family
bitters
he
was
stricken
dumb
doudney
saw
it
all
and
roared
wal
that
a
good
one
we
two
tryin
to
sell
each
other
bitters
ho

whoop
wal
this
is
rich
how
many
bottles
did

none

your
business
said
uncle
ethan
as
he
turned
and
made
off
while
doudney
screamed
with
merriment
on
his
way
home
uncle
ethan
grew
ashamed
of
his
burden
doudney
had
canvassed
the
whole
neighborhood
and
he
practically
gave
up
the
struggle
everybody
he
met
seemed
determined
to
find
out
what
he
had
been
doing
and
at
last
he
began
lying
about
it
hello
uncle
ripley
what
y
got
there
in
that
pail
goose
eggs
settin
he
disposed
of
one
bottle
to
old
gus
peterson
gus
never
paid
his
debts
and
he
would
only
promise
fifty
cents
on
tick
for
the
bottle
and
yet
so
desperate
was
ripley
that
this
questionable
sale
cheered
him
up
not
a
little
as
he
came
down
the
road
tired
dusty
and
hungry
he
climbed
over
the
fence
in
order
to
avoid
seeing
that
sign
on
the
barn
and
slunk
into
the
house
without
looking
back
he
could
have
felt
meaner
about
it
if
he
had
allowed
a
democratic
poster
to
be
pasted
there
the
evening
passed
in
grim
silence
and
in
sleep
he
saw
that
sign
wriggling
across
the
side
of
the
barn
like
hung
on
rails
he
tried
to
paint
them
out
but
every
time
he
tried
it
the
man
seemed
to
come
back
with
a
sheriff
and
savagely
warned
him
to
let
it
stay
till
the
year
was
up
in
some
mysterious
way
the
agent
seemed
to
know
every
time
he
brought
out
the
and
he
was
no
longer
the
individual
who
drove
the
calico
ponies
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
yard
next
morning
that
abominable
sickening
scrawling
advertisement
was
the
first
thing
that
claimed
his
glance
it
blotted
out
the
beauty
of
the
morning
ripley
came
to
the
window
buttoning
her
dress
at
the
throat
a
wisp
of
her
hair
sticking
assertively
from
the
little
knob
at
the
back
of
her
head
lovely
ai
it
an
i
got
to
see
it
all
day
long
i
ca
look
out
the
winder
but
that
thing
right
in
my
face
it
seemed
to
make
her
savage
she
had
been
in
such
a
temper
since
her
visit
to
new
york
i
hope
you
feel
satisfied
with
it
ripley
walked
off
to
the
barn
his
pride
in
its
clean
sweet
newness
was
gone
he
slyly
tried
the
paint
to
see
if
it
could
be
scraped
off
but
it
was
dried
in
thoroughly
whereas
before
he
had
taken
delight
in
having
his
neighbors
turn
and
look
at
the
building
now
he
kept
out
of
sight
whenever
he
saw
a
team
coming
he
hoed
corn
away
in
the
back
of
the
field
when
he
should
have
been
bugging
potatoes
by
the
roadside
ripley
was
in
a
frightful
mood
about
it
but
she
held
herself
in
check
for
several
days
at
last
she
burst
forth
ethan
ripley
i
ca
stand
that
thing
any
longer
and
i
ai
goin
to

another
day

makes
me
boil
every
time
i
look
out
the
winder
uncle
ethan
hitched
up
his
team
and
drove
gloomily
off
to
town
where
he
tried
to
find
the
agent
he
lived
in
some
other
part
of
the
county
however
and
so
the
old
man
gave
up
and
bought
a
pot
of
red
paint
not
daring
to
go
back
to
his
desperate
wife
without
it
goin
to
paint
new
barn
inquired
the
merchant
with
friendly
interest
uncle
ethan
turned
with
guilty
sharpness
but
the
merchant
face
was
grave
and
kindly
yes
i
thought
i
tech
it
up
a
little
do
cost
much
it
pays
always
the
merchant
said
emphatically
will
it
stick
jest
as
well
put
on
evenings
inquired
uncle
ethan
hesitatingly
yes
wo
make
any
difference
why
ai
goin
to
have
wal
i
kind
o
thought
i
do
it
odd
times
night
an
mornin
kind
odd
times
he
seemed
oddly
confused
about
it
and
the
merchant
looked
after
him
anxiously
as
he
drove
away
after
supper
that
night
he
went
out
to
the
barn
and
ripley
heard
him
sawing
and
hammering
then
the
noise
ceased
and
he
came
in
and
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
what
y
ben
makin
she
inquired
tewksbury
had
gone
to
bed
she
sat
darning
a
stocking
i
jest
thought
i
git
the
stagin
ready
paintin
he
said
evasively
wal
i
be
glad
when
it
covered
up
when
she
got
ready
for
bed
he
was
still
seated
in
his
chair
and
after
she
had
dozed
off
two
or
three
times
she
began
to
wonder
why
he
did
come
when
the
clock
struck
ten
and
she
realized
that
he
had
not
stirred
she
began
to
get
impatient
come
are
y
goin
to
sit
there
all
night
there
was
no
reply
she
rose
up
in
bed
and
looked
about
the
room
the
broad
moon
flooded
it
with
light
so
that
she
could
see
he
was
not
asleep
in
his
chair
as
she
had
supposed
there
was
something
ominous
in
his
disappearance
ethan
ethan
ripley
where
are
yeh
there
was
no
reply
to
her
sharp
call
she
rose
and
distractedly
looked
about
among
the
furniture
as
if
he
might
somehow
be
a
cat
and
be
hiding
in
a
corner
somewhere
then
she
went
upstairs
where
the
boy
slept
her
hard
little
heels
making
a
curious
tunking
noise
on
the
bare
boards
the
moon
fell
across
the
sleeping
boy
like
a
robe
of
silver
he
was
alone
she
began
to
be
alarmed
her
eyes
widened
in
fear
all
sorts
of
vague
horrors
sprang
unbidden
into
her
brain
she
still
had
the
mist
of
sleep
in
her
brain
she
hurried
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
fragrant
night
the
katydids
were
singing
in
infinite
peace
under
the
solemn
splendor
of
the
moon
the
cattle
sniffed
and
sighed
jangling
their
bells
now
and
then
and
the
chickens
in
the
coop
stirred
uneasily
as
if
overheated
the
old
woman
stood
there
in
her
bare
feet
and
long
nightgown
the
ghastly
story
of
a
man
who
had
hung
himself
in
his
barn
because
his
wife
deserted
him
came
into
her
mind
and
stayed
there
with
frightful
persistency
her
throat
filled
chokingly
she
felt
a
wild
rush
of
loneliness
she
had
a
sudden
realization
of
how
dear
that
gaunt
old
figure
was
with
its
grizzled
face
and
ready
smile
her
breath
came
quick
and
quicker
and
she
was
at
the
point
of
bursting
into
a
wild
cry
to
tewksbury
when
she
heard
a
strange
noise
it
came
from
the
barn
a
creaking
noise
she
looked
that
way
and
saw
in
the
shadowed
side
a
deeper
shadow
moving
to
and
fro
a
revulsion
to
astonishment
and
anger
took
place
in
her
land
o
bungay
if
he
ai
paintin
that
barn
like
a
perfect
old
idiot
in
the
night
uncle
ethan
working
desperately
did
not
hear
her
feet
pattering
down
the
path
and
was
startled
by
her
shrill
voice
well
ethan
ripley
whaddy
y
think
you
doin
now
he
made
two
or
three
slapping
passes
with
the
brush
and
then
snapped
out
i
this
barn
whaddy
ye
if
ye
had
eyes
would
ask
well
you
come
right
straight
to
bed
what
mean

actin
so

back
into
the
house
an
let
me
be
i
know
what
i
you
pestered
me
about
this
sign
jest
about
enough
he
dabbed
his
brush
to
and
fro
as
he
spoke
his
gaunt
figure
towered
above
her
in
shadow
his
slapping
brush
had
a
vicious
sound
neither
spoke
for
some
time
at
length
she
said
more
gently
ai
you
comin
in
no
not
till
i
get
you
go
an
tend
to
own
business
do
stan
there
an
ketch
cold
she
moved
off
slowly
toward
the
house
his
shout
subdued
her
working
alone
out
there
had
rendered
him
savage
he
was
not
to
be
pushed
any
further
she
knew
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
must
now
be
respected
she
slipped
on
her
shoes
and
a
shawl
and
came
back
where
he
was
working
and
took
a
seat
on
a
i
goin
to
set
right
here
till
you
come
in
ethan
ripley
she
said
in
a
firm
voice
but
gentler
than
usual
wal
you
set
a
good
while
was
his
ungracious
reply
but
each
felt
a
furtive
tenderness
for
the
other
he
worked
on
in
silence
the
boards
creaked
heavily
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
and
the
slapping
sound
of
the
sounded
loud
in
the
sweet
harmony
of
the
night
the
majestic
moon
swung
slowly
round
the
corner
of
the
barn
and
fell
upon
the
old
man
grizzled
head
and
bent
shoulders
the
horses
inside
could
be
heard
stamping
the
mosquitoes
away
and
chewing
their
hay
in
pleasant
chorus
the
little
figure
seated
on
the
drew
the
shawl
closer
about
her
thin
shoulders
her
eyes
were
in
shadow
and
her
hands
were
wrapped
in
her
shawl
at
last
she
spoke
in
a
curious
tone
wal
i
do
know
as
you
was
so
very
much
to
blame
i
did
want
that
bible
myself
i
held
out
i
did
but
i
did
ethan
worked
on
until
the
full
meaning
of
this
unprecedented
surrender
penetrated
his
head
and
then
he
threw
down
his
brush
wal
i
guess
i
let
go
at
that
i
covered
up
the
most
of
it
anyhow
guess
we
better
go
in
god
ravens
i
chicago
has
three
winds
that
blow
upon
it
one
comes
from
the
east
and
the
mind
goes
out
to
the
cold
lake
one
from
the
north
and
men
think
of
illimitable
spaces
of
and
ridges
which
lead
to
the
unknown
deeps
of
the
arctic
woods
but
the
third
is
the
west
or
southwest
wind
dry
magnetic
full
of
smell
of
unmeasured
miles
of
growing
grain
in
summer
or
ripening
corn
and
wheat
in
autumn
when
it
comes
in
winter
the
air
glitters
with
incredible
brilliancy
the
snow
of
the
country
dazzles
and
flames
in
the
eyes
shadows
everywhere
stream
like
stains
of
ink
wrangle
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
and
every
step
is
quick
and
alert
in
the
city
smoke
dims
its
clarity
but
it
is
welcome
but
its
greatest
moment
of
domination
is
spring
the
bitter
gray
wind
of
the
east
has
held
unchecked
rule
for
days
giving
place
to
its
brother
the
north
wind
only
at
intervals
till
some
day
in
march
the
wind
of
the
southwest
begins
to
blow
then
the
eaves
begin
to
drip
here
and
there
a
fowl
in
a
house
that
is
really
a
prison
begins
to
sing
the
song
it
sang
on
the
farm
and
toward
noon
its
song
becomes
a
chant
of
articulate
joy
then
the
poor
crawl
out
of
their
reeking
hovels
on
the
south
and
west
sides
to
stand
in
the
sun
the
blessed
sun
and
felicitate
themselves
on
being
alive
windows
of
are
opened
the
merry
small
boy
goes
to
school
without
his
tippet
and
men
lay
off
their
long
ulsters
for
their
beaver
coats
caps
give
place
to
hats
and
men
and
women
pause
to
chat
when
they
meet
each
other
on
the
street
the
open
door
is
the
sign
of
the
great
change
of
wind
there
are
imaginative
souls
who
are
stirred
yet
deeper
by
this
wind
men
like
robert
bloom
to
whom
come
vague
and
very
sweet
reminiscences
of
farm
life
when
the
snow
is
melting
and
the
dry
ground
begins
to
appear
to
these
people
the
wind
comes
from
the
wide
unending
spaces
of
the
prairie
west
they
can
smell
the
strange
thrilling
odor
of
newly
uncovered
sod
and
moist
brown
ploughed
lands
to
them
it
is
like
the
opening
door
of
a
prison
robert
had
crawled
and
up
to
his
office
high
in
the
star
block
after
a
month
sickness
he
had
resolutely
pulled
a
pad
of
paper
under
his
hand
to
write
but
the
window
was
open
and
that
wind
coming
in
and
he
could
not
write
he
could
only
dream
his
brown
hair
fell
over
the
thin
white
hand
which
propped
his
head
his
face
was
like
ivory
with
dull
yellowish
stains
in
it
his
eyes
did
not
see
the
mountainous
roofs
humped
and
piled
into
vast
masses
of
brick
and
stone
crossed
and
riven
by
streets
and
swept
by
masses
of
vapor
they
saw
a
little
valley
circled
by
bluffs
his
native
town
in
wisconsin
as
his
weakness
grew
his
ambition
fell
away
and
his
heart
turned
back
to
nature
and
to
the
things
he
had
known
in
his
youth
to
the
kindly
people
of
the
olden
time
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
the
spirit
of
the
country
might
have
changed
sitting
thus
he
had
a
mighty
longing
come
upon
him
to
give
up
the
struggle
to
go
back
to
the
simplest
life
with
his
wife
and
two
boys
why
should
he
tread
in
the
mill
when
every
day
was
taking
the
out
of
his
heart
slowly
his
longing
took
resolution
at
last
he
drew
his
desk
down
and
as
the
lock
clicked
it
seemed
like
the
shutting
of
a
prison
gate
behind
him
at
the
elevator
door
he
met
a
hello
bloom
did
know
you
were
down
i
only
trying
it
i
going
to
take
a
vacation
for
a
while
that
right
man
you
look
like
a
ghost
he
had
the
courage
to
tell
him
he
never
expected
to
work
there
again
his
step
on
the
way
home
was
firmer
than
it
had
been
for
weeks
in
his
white
face
his
wife
saw
some
subtle
change
what
is
it
robert
mate
let
give
it
up
what
do
you
mean
the
struggle
is
too
hard
i
ca
stand
it
i
hungry
for
the
country
again
let
get
out
of
this
where
we
go
back
to
my
native
town
up
among
the
wisconsin
hills
and
coulies
go
anywhere
so
that
we
escape
this
pressure
it
killing
me
let
go
to
bluff
siding
for
a
year
it
will
do
me
good
may
bring
me
back
to
life
i
can
do
enough
special
work
to
pay
our
grocery
bill
and
the
merrill
place
so
jack
tells
me
is
empty
we
can
get
it
for
dollars
for
a
year
we
can
pull
through
some
way
very
well
robert
i
must
have
rest
all
the
bounce
has
gone
out
of
me
mate
he
said
with
sad
lines
in
his
face
any
extra
work
here
is
out
of
the
question
i
can
only
shamble
around
an
excuse
for
a
man
the
wife
had
ceased
to
smile
her
strenuous
cheerfulness
could
not
hold
before
his
tragically
drawn
and
bloodless
face
i
go
wherever
you
think
best
robert
it
will
be
just
as
well
for
the
boys
i
suppose
there
is
a
school
there
oh
yes
at
any
rate
they
can
get
a
year
schooling
in
nature
well
no
matter
robert
you
are
the
one
to
be
considered
she
had
the
devotion
of
the
average
woman
she
fancied
herself
hopelessly
his
inferior
they
had
dwelt
so
long
on
the
crumbling
edge
of
poverty
that
they
were
hardened
to
its
threat
and
yet
the
failure
of
robert
health
had
been
of
the
sort
which
terrifies
it
was
a
slow
but
steady
sinking
of
vital
force
it
had
its
ups
and
downs
but
it
was
a
downward
trail
always
downward
the
time
for
had
passed
his
paper
paid
him
a
meagre
salary
for
his
work
was
prized
only
by
the
more
thoughtful
readers
of
the
star
in
addition
to
his
regular
work
he
occasionally
hazarded
a
story
for
the
juvenile
magazines
of
the
east
in
this
way
he
turned
the
antics
of
his
growing
boys
to
account
as
he
often
said
to
his
wife
he
had
also
passed
the
preliminary
stages
of
literary
success
by
getting
a
couple
of
stories
accepted
by
an
eastern
magazine
and
he
still
confidently
looked
forward
to
seeing
them
printed
his
wife
a
sturdy
practical
little
body
did
her
part
in
the
bitter
struggle
by
keeping
their
little
home
one
of
the
most
attractive
on
the
west
side
the
north
side
being
altogether
too
high
for
them
in
addition
her
sorely
pressed
brain
sought
out
other
ways
of
helping
she
wrote
out
all
her
husband
stories
on
the
typewriter
and
secretly
she
had
tried
composing
others
herself
the
results
being
queer
dry
little
chronicles
of
the
doings
of
men
and
women
strung
together
without
a
touch
of
literary
grace
she
proposed
taking
a
large
house
and
rooms
but
robert
would
not
hear
to
it
as
long
as
i
can
crawl
about
we
leave
that
to
others
in
the
month
of
preparation
which
followed
he
talked
a
great
deal
about
their
venture
i
want
to
get
there
he
said
just
when
the
leaves
are
coming
out
on
the
trees
i
want
to
see
the
blossom
on
the
hillsides
the
always
get
green
first
at
other
times
he
talked
about
the
people
it
will
be
a
rest
just
to
get
back
among
people
who
are
ready
to
tread
on
your
head
in
order
to
lift
themselves
up
i
believe
a
year
among
those
kind
unhurried
people
will
give
me
all
the
material
i
need
for
years
i
write
a
series
of
studies
somewhat
like
jefferies
or
barrie
only
of
course
i
be
original
i
just
take
his
plan
of
telling
about
the
people
i
meet
and
their
queer
ways
so
quaint
and
good
i
tired
of
the
scramble
he
kept
breaking
out
of
silence
to
say
i
do
blame
the
boys
but
it
plain
to
me
they
see
that
my
going
will
let
them
move
up
one
mason
cynically
voiced
the
whole
thing
today
can
say
to
see
you
go
bloom
because
your
going
does
concern
me
i
not
in
line
of
succession
but
some
of
the
other
boys
do
feel
so
there
no
divinity
doth
hedge
an
editor
nothing
but
law
prevents
the
murder
of
those
above
by
those
below
i
do
like
mason
when
he
talks
like
that
said
the
wife
well
i
do
he
did
tell
her
what
mason
said
when
robert
talked
about
the
good
simple
life
of
the
people
in
bluff
siding
oh
bosh
bloom
you
find
the
struggle
of
the
outside
world
reflected
in
your
little
town
you
find
men
and
women
just
as
hard
and
selfish
in
their
small
way
it
be
harder
to
bear
because
it
will
all
be
so
petty
and
pusillanimous
it
was
a
lovely
day
in
late
april
when
they
took
the
train
out
of
the
great
grimy
terrible
city
it
was
eight
but
the
streets
were
muddy
and
wet
a
cold
east
wind
blowing
off
the
lake
with
clanging
bell
the
train
moved
away
piercing
the
ragged
gray
formless
mob
of
houses
and
streets
through
which
railways
always
run
in
a
city
men
were
hurrying
to
work
and
robert
pitied
them
poor
fellows
condemned
to
do
that
thing
forever
in
an
hour
they
reached
the
prairies
already
clothed
upon
faintly
with
green
grass
and
tender
springing
wheat
the
squares
reserved
for
the
corn
looked
deliciously
soft
and
warm
to
the
sick
man
and
he
longed
to
set
his
bare
feet
into
it
his
boys
were
wild
with
delight
they
had
the
natural
love
of
the
earth
still
in
them
and
correspondingly
cared
little
for
the
city
they
raced
through
the
cars
like
colts
they
saw
everything
every
blossoming
plant
every
budding
tree
was
precious
to
them
all
all
day
they
rode
toward
noon
they
left
the
sunny
of
northern
illinois
and
southern
wisconsin
and
entered
upon
the
of
madison
and
beyond
as
they
went
north
the
season
was
less
advanced
but
spring
was
in
the
fresh
wind
and
the
warm
sunshine
as
evening
drew
on
the
hylas
began
to
peep
from
the
pools
and
their
chorus
deepened
as
they
came
on
toward
bluff
siding
which
seemed
very
small
very
squalid
and
uninteresting
but
robert
pointed
at
the
circling
wall
of
hills
and
the
warm
sunset
sky
we
in
luck
to
find
a
hotel
said
robert
they
burn
down
every
three
months
they
were
met
by
a
man
and
conducted
across
the
road
to
a
hotel
which
had
been
a
rink
in
other
days
and
was
not
prepossessing
however
they
were
ushered
into
the
parlor
which
resembled
the
of
a
rather
ambitious
village
home
and
there
they
took
seats
while
the
landlord
consulted
about
rooms
the
wife
heart
sank
from
the
window
she
could
see
several
of
the
low
houses
and
far
off
just
the
hills
which
seemed
to
make
the
town
so
very
small
very
lonely
she
was
not
given
time
to
shed
tears
the
children
clamored
for
food
tired
and
cross
robert
went
out
into
the
office
where
he
signed
his
name
under
the
close
and
silent
scrutiny
of
a
roughly
clad
men
who
sat
leaning
against
the
wall
they
were
merely
to
him
but
in
bloom
eyes
they
were
dangerous
people
the
landlord
looked
at
the
name
as
robert
wrote
your
boxes
are
all
here
he
said
robert
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
what
boxes
your
household
goods
they
came
in
on
no
robert
recovered
himself
he
remembered
this
was
a
village
where
everything
that
goes
on
everything
is
known
the
stairway
rose
picturesquely
out
of
the
office
to
the
low
second
story
and
up
these
stairs
they
tramped
to
their
tiny
rooms
which
were
like
cells
oh
mamma
ai
it
queer
cried
the
boys
supper
is
all
ready
the
landlord
soft
deep
voice
announced
a
few
moments
later
and
the
boys
responded
with
whoops
of
hunger
they
were
met
by
the
close
scrutiny
of
every
boarder
as
they
entered
and
they
heard
also
the
muttered
comments
and
explanations
family
to
take
the
merrill
house
he
looks
purty
well
flaxed
out
do
he
they
were
agreeably
surprised
to
find
everything
neat
and
clean
and
wholesome
the
bread
was
good
and
the
butter
delicious
their
spirits
revived
that
butter
tastes
like
old
times
said
robert
it
fresh
really
butter
they
made
a
hearty
meal
and
the
boys
being
filled
up
grew
sleepy
after
they
were
put
to
bed
robert
said
now
mate
let
go
see
the
house
they
walked
out
arm
in
arm
like
lovers
her
sturdy
form
steadied
him
though
he
would
not
have
acknowledged
it
the
red
flush
was
not
yet
gone
from
the
west
and
the
hills
still
kept
a
splendid
tone
of
it
was
very
clear
the
stars
were
out
the
wind
deliciously
soft
it
still
robert
almost
whispered
they
walked
on
under
the
budding
trees
up
the
hill
till
they
came
at
last
to
the
small
frame
house
set
under
tall
maples
and
just
showing
a
feathery
fringe
of
foliage
this
is
our
home
said
robert
mate
leaned
on
the
gate
in
silence
frogs
were
peeping
the
smell
of
spring
was
in
the
air
there
was
a
magnificent
repose
in
the
hour
restful
recreating
impressive
oh
it
beautiful
robert
i
know
we
shall
like
it
we
must
like
it
he
said
ii
first
contact
with
the
people
disappointed
robert
in
the
work
of
moving
in
he
had
to
do
with
people
who
work
at
day
work
and
the
fault
was
his
more
than
theirs
he
forgot
that
they
did
not
consider
their
work
degrading
they
resented
his
bossing
the
drayman
grew
rebellious
look
my
christian
friend
if
you
go
in
the
house
and
let
us
alone
it
be
a
good
job
we
know
what
we
about
this
was
not
pleasant
and
he
did
not
perceive
the
trouble
in
the
same
way
he
got
foul
of
the
carpenter
and
the
man
who
ploughed
his
garden
some
way
his
tone
was
not
right
his
voice
was
cold
and
distant
he
generally
found
that
the
men
knew
better
than
he
what
was
to
be
done
and
how
to
do
it
and
sometimes
he
felt
like
apologizing
but
their
attitude
had
changed
till
apology
was
impossible
he
had
repelled
their
friendly
advances
because
he
considered
them
without
meaning
to
do
so
as
workmen
and
not
as
neighbors
they
reported
therefore
that
he
was
cranky
and
rode
a
high
horse
he
thinks
he
a
little
tin
god
on
wheels
the
drayman
said
oh
he
get
over
that
said
mclane
i
knew
the
boy
folks
years
ago
tiptop
folks
too
he
ai
well
and
that
makes
him
a
little
crusty
that
the
trouble
he
thinks
he
an
upper
crust
said
jim
cullen
the
drayman
at
the
end
of
ten
days
they
were
settled
and
nothing
remained
to
do
but
plan
a
little
garden
and
get
well
the
boys
with
their
unspoiled
natures
were
able
to
melt
into
the
ranks
of
the
life
at
once
with
no
more
friction
than
was
indicated
by
a
couple
of
fights
they
were
sturdy
fellows
like
their
mother
and
these
fights
gave
them
high
rank
robert
got
along
in
a
dull
smooth
way
with
his
neighbors
he
was
too
formal
with
them
he
met
them
only
at
the
and
the
they
nodded
genially
and
said
got
settled
yet
and
he
replied
quite
comfortable
thank
you
they
felt
his
coldness
conversation
halted
when
he
came
near
and
made
him
feel
that
he
was
the
subject
of
their
talk
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
generally
was
he
was
a
source
of
great
speculation
with
them
some
of
them
had
gone
so
far
as
to
bet
he
would
live
a
year
they
all
seemed
grotesque
to
him
so
and
bent
and
hairy
even
the
men
whose
names
he
had
known
from
childhood
were
queer
to
him
they
seemed
shy
and
distant
too
not
like
his
ideas
of
them
to
mate
they
were
almost
caricatures
what
makes
them
look
so
so
behind
the
times
robert
well
i
suppose
they
are
said
robert
life
in
these
coulies
goes
on
rather
slower
than
in
chicago
then
there
are
a
great
many
welsh
and
germans
and
norwegians
living
up
the
coulies
and
they
the
ones
you
notice
they
not
all
so
he
could
be
generous
toward
them
in
general
it
was
in
special
cases
where
he
failed
to
know
them
they
had
been
there
nearly
two
weeks
without
meeting
any
of
them
socially
and
robert
was
beginning
to
change
his
opinion
about
them
they
let
us
severely
alone
he
was
saying
one
night
to
his
wife
it
very
odd
i
wonder
what
i
better
do
robert
i
do
know
the
etiquette
of
these
small
towns
i
never
lived
in
one
before
you
know
whether
i
ought
to
call
first
and
good
gracious
who
i
call
on
in
the
dark
so
am
i
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
lived
in
one
of
these
small
towns
since
i
was
a
lad
i
have
a
faint
recollection
that
introductions
were
absolutely
necessary
they
have
an
etiquette
which
is
as
binding
as
that
of
mcallister
four
hundred
but
what
it
is
i
do
know
well
we
wait
the
boys
are
perfectly
at
home
said
robert
with
a
little
emphasis
on
boys
which
was
the
first
indication
of
his
disappointment
the
people
he
had
failed
to
reach
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
that
startled
them
both
come
in
said
robert
in
a
nervous
shout
land
sakes
did
i
scare
ye
seem
so
way
ye
yelled
said
a
nasal
voice
and
a
tall
woman
came
in
followed
by
an
equally
stalwart
man
how
do
folsom
my
wife
mr
folsom
folsom
voice
was
lost
in
the
bustle
of
getting
settled
but
folsom
voice
rose
above
the
clamor
i
was
tellin
him
it
was
about
time
we
got
neighborly
i
never
let
anybody
come
to
town
a
week
without
callin
on
it
does
a
body
a
heap
o
good
to
see
a
face
outside
the
family
once
in
a
while
specially
in
a
new
place
how
do
you
like
up
here
on
the
hill
very
much
the
view
is
so
fine
yes
i
it
is
still
it
ai
my
notion
i
do
like
to
climb
hills
well
enough
still
i
heard
of
people
buildin
just
for
the
view
it
all
in
taste
as
the
old
woman
said
that
kissed
the
cow
there
was
an
element
of
shrewdness
and
in
folsom
which
saved
her
from
being
grotesque
she
knew
she
was
queer
to
bloom
but
she
did
not
resent
it
she
was
still
young
in
form
and
face
but
her
teeth
were
gone
and
like
so
many
of
her
neighbors
she
was
too
poor
to
replace
them
from
the
dentist
she
wore
a
decent
calico
dress
and
a
shawl
and
hat
as
she
talked
her
eyes
took
in
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
and
every
little
piece
of
and
in
fact
she
reproduced
the
pattern
of
one
of
the
tidies
within
two
days
folsom
sat
dumbly
in
his
chair
robert
who
met
him
now
as
a
neighbor
for
the
first
time
tried
to
talk
with
him
but
failed
and
turned
himself
gladly
to
folsom
who
delighted
him
with
her
vigorous
phrases
oh
we
though
you
would
think
it
this
town
is
filled
with
a
lot
of
old
skinflints
close
ai
no
name
for
jest
ask
folsom
thar
about
he
been
buildin
their
houses
for
still
i
suppose
they
say
the
same
thing
o
me
she
added
with
a
touch
of
humor
which
always
saved
her
she
used
a
man
phrases
we
always
ready
to
tax
some
other
feller
but
we
kick
like
mules
when
the
tax
falls
on
us
she
went
on
my
land
the
fight
we
had
to
git
sidewalks
in
this
town
you
should
be
mayor
that
what
i
tell
folsom
takes
a
woman
to
clean
things
up
well
i
must
run
along
thought
i
jest
call
in
and
see
how
you
all
was
come
down
when
ye
kin
thank
you
i
will
after
they
had
gone
robert
turned
with
a
smile
our
first
formal
call
oh
dear
robert
what
can
i
do
with
such
people
go
see
i
like
her
she
shrewd
you
like
her
too
but
what
can
i
say
to
such
people
did
you
hear
her
say
fellers
to
me
robert
laughed
that
nothing
she
feels
as
much
of
a
man
or
as
any
one
why
should
she
but
she
so
vulgar
i
admit
she
is
elegant
but
i
think
she
a
good
wife
and
mother
i
wonder
if
they
all
like
that
now
mate
we
must
try
not
to
offend
them
we
must
try
to
be
one
of
them
but
this
was
easier
said
than
done
as
he
went
down
to
the
and
stood
waiting
for
his
mail
like
the
rest
he
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
with
them
but
mainly
they
moved
away
from
him
william
mcturg
nodded
at
him
and
said
how
de
do
and
mclane
asked
how
he
liked
his
new
place
and
that
was
about
all
he
could
reach
them
they
suspected
him
they
had
only
the
estimate
of
the
men
who
had
worked
for
him
and
while
they
were
civil
they
plainly
did
need
him
in
the
slightest
degree
except
as
a
topic
of
conversation
he
did
not
improve
as
he
had
hoped
to
do
the
spring
was
wet
and
cold
the
most
rainy
and
depressing
the
valley
had
seen
in
many
years
day
after
day
the
sailed
in
over
the
northern
hills
and
deluged
the
flat
little
town
with
water
till
the
frogs
sang
in
every
street
till
the
main
street
mired
down
every
team
that
drove
into
it
the
corn
rotted
in
the
earth
but
the
grass
grew
tall
and
the
trees
glistened
through
the
gray
air
and
the
hills
were
like
green
jewels
of
incalculable
worth
when
the
sun
shone
at
sweet
infrequent
intervals
the
cold
and
damp
struck
through
into
the
alien
heart
it
seemed
to
prophesy
his
dark
future
he
sat
at
his
desk
and
looked
out
into
the
gray
rain
with
gloomy
eyes
a
prisoner
when
he
had
expected
to
be
free
he
had
failed
in
his
last
venture
he
had
not
gained
any
power
he
was
really
weaker
than
ever
the
rain
had
kept
him
confined
to
the
house
the
joy
he
had
anticipated
of
tracing
out
all
his
boyish
pleasure
haunts
was
cut
off
he
had
relied
too
upon
that
as
a
source
of
literary
power
he
could
not
do
much
more
than
walk
down
to
the
and
back
on
the
pleasantest
days
a
few
people
called
but
he
could
not
talk
to
them
and
they
did
not
call
again
in
the
mean
while
his
little
was
vanishing
the
boys
were
strong
and
happy
that
was
his
only
comfort
and
his
wife
seemed
strong
too
she
had
little
time
to
get
lonesome
he
grew
morbid
his
weakness
and
insecurity
made
him
jealous
of
the
security
and
health
of
others
he
grew
almost
to
hate
the
people
as
he
saw
them
coming
and
going
in
the
mud
or
heard
their
loud
hearty
voices
sounding
from
the
street
he
hated
their
gossip
their
dull
jokes
the
flat
little
town
grew
vulgar
and
low
and
desolate
to
him
every
little
thing
which
had
amused
him
now
annoyed
him
the
cut
of
their
beards
worried
him
their
voices
jarred
upon
him
every
day
or
two
he
broke
forth
to
his
wife
in
long
tirades
of
abuse
oh
i
ca
stand
these
people
they
do
know
anything
they
talk
every
rag
of
gossip
into
shreds
fish
hops
hops
fish
and
they
saved
and
pinched
and
toiled
till
their
souls
are
pinched
and
ground
away
you
right
they
are
caricatures
they
read
or
think
about
anything
in
which
i
interested
this
life
is
talk
about
the
health
of
the
village
life
it
destroys
body
and
soul
it
debilitates
me
it
will
warp
us
both
down
to
the
level
of
these
people
she
tried
to
stop
him
but
he
went
on
a
flush
of
fever
on
his
cheek
they
degrade
the
nature
they
have
touched
their
squat
little
town
is
a
caricature
like
themselves
everything
they
touch
they
belittle
here
they
sit
while
sidewalks
rot
and
teams
mire
in
the
streets
he
raged
on
like
one
demented
bitter
accusing
rebellious
in
such
a
mood
he
could
not
write
in
place
of
inspiring
him
the
little
town
and
its
people
seemed
to
undermine
his
power
and
turn
his
sweetness
of
spirit
into
gall
and
acid
he
only
bowed
to
them
now
as
he
walked
feebly
among
them
and
they
excused
it
by
referring
to
his
sickness
they
eyed
him
each
time
with
pitying
eyes
he
failin
fast
they
said
among
themselves
one
day
as
he
was
returning
from
the
he
felt
blind
for
a
moment
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
the
world
of
vivid
green
grew
gray
and
life
receded
from
him
into
illimitable
distance
he
had
one
dim
fading
glimpse
of
a
face
looking
down
at
him
and
felt
the
clutch
of
an
strong
arm
under
him
and
then
he
lost
hold
even
on
so
much
consciousness
he
came
back
slowly
rising
out
of
immeasurable
deeps
toward
a
distant
light
which
was
like
the
mouth
of
a
well
filled
with
clouds
of
misty
vapor
occasionally
he
saw
a
brown
big
hairy
face
floating
in
over
this
lighted
horizon
to
smile
kindly
and
go
away
again
others
came
with
shaggy
beards
he
heard
a
cheery
tenor
voice
which
he
recognized
and
then
another
face
a
big
brown
smiling
face
very
lovely
it
looked
now
to
him
almost
as
lovely
as
his
wife
which
floated
in
from
the
other
side
he
all
right
now
said
the
cheery
tenor
voice
from
the
big
bearded
face
oh
mcturg
do
you
think
so
sir
he
all
right
the
fever
left
him
brace
up
old
man
we
need
ye
yit
awhile
then
all
was
silent
again
the
cleared
away
its
mist
again
and
he
saw
more
clearly
part
of
the
time
he
knew
he
was
in
bed
staring
at
the
ceiling
part
of
the
time
the
remained
closed
in
with
clouds
gaunt
old
women
put
spoons
of
delicious
broth
to
his
lips
and
their
toothless
mouths
had
kindly
lines
about
them
he
heard
their
high
voices
sounding
faintly
now
mis
bloom
jest
let
mis
folsom
an
me
attend
to
things
out
here
we
get
supper
for
the
boys
an
you
jest
go
an
lay
down
we
take
care
of
him
do
worry
bell
a
good
hand
with
sick
then
the
light
came
again
and
he
heard
a
robin
singing
and
a
squalled
softly
pitifully
he
could
see
the
ceiling
again
he
lay
on
his
back
with
his
hands
on
his
breast
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
dead
he
seemed
to
feel
his
body
as
if
it
were
an
alien
thing
how
are
you
sir
called
the
laughing
thrillingly
hearty
voice
of
william
mcturg
he
tried
to
turn
his
head
but
it
would
move
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
dry
throat
made
no
noise
the
big
man
bent
over
him
want
change
place
a
little
he
closed
his
eyes
in
answer
a
giant
arm
ran
deftly
under
his
shoulders
and
turned
him
as
if
he
were
an
infant
and
a
new
part
of
the
good
old
world
burst
on
his
sight
the
sunshine
streamed
in
the
windows
through
a
waving
screen
of
lilac
leaves
and
fell
upon
the
carpet
in
a
priceless
flood
of
radiance
there
sat
william
mcturg
smiling
at
him
he
had
no
coat
on
and
no
hat
and
his
bushy
thick
hair
rose
up
from
his
forehead
like
thick
he
looked
to
be
the
embodiment
of
sunshine
and
health
sun
and
air
were
in
his
brown
face
and
the
perfect
health
of
a
fine
animal
was
in
his
huge
limbs
he
looked
at
robert
with
a
smile
that
brought
a
strange
feeling
into
his
throat
it
made
him
try
to
speak
at
last
he
whispered
the
great
figure
bent
closer
what
is
it
thank
you
william
laughed
a
low
chuckle
do
bother
about
thanks
would
you
like
some
water
a
tall
figure
joined
william
awkwardly
hello
evan
how
is
he
bill
he
awake
that
good
anything
i
can
do
no
i
guess
not
all
he
needs

i

a
chicken
up
an
some
jell
an
things
the
women
sent
i
stay
with
him
till
twelve
then
folsom
will
come
in
thereafter
he
lay
hearing
the
robins
laugh
and
the
orioles
whistle
and
then
the
frogs
and
katydids
at
night
these
men
with
greasy
vests
and
unkempt
beards
came
in
every
day
they
bathed
him
and
helped
him
to
and
from
the
bed
they
helped
to
dress
him
and
move
him
to
the
window
where
he
could
look
out
on
the
blessed
green
of
the
grass
o
god
it
was
so
beautiful
it
was
a
lover
joy
only
to
live
to
look
into
these
radiant
vistas
again
a
was
singing
in
the
a
robin
was
hopping
across
the
lawn
the
voices
of
the
children
sounded
soft
and
jocund
across
the
road
and
the
sunshine
beloved
christ
thy
sunshine
falling
upon
my
feet
his
soul
ached
with
the
joy
of
it
and
when
his
wife
came
in
she
found
him
sobbing
like
a
child
they
seemed
never
to
weary
in
his
service
they
lifted
him
about
and
talked
to
him
in
loud
and
hearty
voices
which
roused
him
like
fresh
winds
from
free
spaces
he
heard
the
women
busy
with
things
in
the
kitchen
he
often
saw
them
loaded
with
things
to
eat
passing
his
window
and
often
his
wife
came
in
and
knelt
down
at
his
bed
oh
robert
they
so
good
they
feed
us
like
god
ravens
one
day
as
he
sat
at
the
window
fully
dressed
for
the
fourth
of
fifth
time
william
mcturg
came
up
the
walk
well
robert
how
are
ye
first
rate
william
he
smiled
i
believe
i
can
walk
out
a
little
if
you
help
me
all
right
sir
and
he
went
forth
leaning
on
william
arm
a
piteous
wraith
of
a
man
on
every
side
the
golden
june
sunshine
fell
filling
the
valley
from
purple
brim
to
purple
brim
down
over
the
hill
to
the
west
the
light
poured
tangled
and
glowing
in
the
plum
and
cherry
trees
leaving
the
glistening
grass
spraying
through
the
elms
and
flinging
streamers
of
pink
across
the
shaven
green
slopes
where
the
cattle
fed
on
every
side
he
saw
kindly
faces
and
heard
hearty
voices
good
day
robert
glad
to
see
you
out
again
it
thrilled
him
to
hear
them
call
him
by
his
first
name
his
heart
swelled
till
he
could
hardly
breathe
the
passion
of
living
came
back
upon
him
shaking
uplifting
him
his
pallid
lips
moved
his
face
was
turned
to
the
sky
o
god
let
me
live
it
is
so
beautiful
o
god
give
me
strength
again
keep
me
in
the
light
of
the
sun
let
me
see
the
green
grass
come
and
go
he
turned
to
william
with
trembling
lips
trying
to
speak
oh
i
understand
you
now
i
know
you
all
now
but
william
did
not
understand
him
there
there
he
said
soothingly
i
guess
you
gettin
tired
he
led
robert
back
and
put
him
to
bed
i
know
but
we
was
a
little
brash
about
goin
out
william
said
to
him
as
robert
lay
there
smiling
up
at
him
oh
i
all
right
now
the
sick
man
said
matie
the
alien
cried
when
william
had
gone
we
know
our
neighbors
now
do
we
we
never
can
hate
or
ridicule
them
again
yes
robert
they
never
will
be
caricatures
again
to
me
a
good
fellow
wife
i
life
in
the
small
towns
of
the
older
west
moves
slowly
almost
as
slowly
as
in
the
seaport
villages
or
little
towns
of
the
east
towns
like
tyre
and
bluff
siding
have
grown
during
the
last
twenty
years
but
very
slowly
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
lying
too
far
away
from
the
mississippi
to
be
affected
by
the
lumber
interest
they
are
merely
for
the
farmers
with
no
perceivable
germs
of
boom
in
their
quiet
life
a
stranger
coming
into
belfast
minnesota
excites
much
the
same
languid
but
persistent
inquiry
as
in
belfast
new
hampshire
juries
of
men
seated
on
and
discuss
the
stranger
appearance
and
his
probable
action
just
as
in
kittery
maine
but
with
a
lazier
and
with
a
shade
less
of
apparent
interest
on
such
a
rainy
day
as
comes
in
may
after
the
corn
is
planted
a
cold
wet
rainy
day
the
usual
crowd
was
gathered
in
wilson
at
bluff
siding
a
small
town
in
the
coally
country
they
were
farmers
for
the
most
part
retired
from
active
service
their
coats
were
of
cheap
diagonal
or
cassimere
much
faded
and
burned
by
the
sun
their
hats
flapped
about
by
winds
and
soaked
with
countless
rains
were
also
of
the
same
tints
one
or
two
wore
paper
collars
on
their
hickory
shirts
mcilvaine
farmer
and
wore
a
paper
collar
and
a
butterfly
necktie
as
befitted
a
man
of
his
station
in
life
he
was
a
short
squarely
made
scotchman
with
sandy
whiskers
much
grayed
and
with
a
keen
intensely
blue
eye
say
called
mcphail
of
the
county
in
the
silence
that
followed
some
remark
about
the
rain
any
o
you
fellers
had
any
talk
with
this
feller
sanford
i
hai
said
vance
you
bill

but
somebody
was
sayin
he
thought
o
startin
in
trade

generally

on

other

wha
she
say
settlin
had
decided
yet
he
too
slick
to
have
much
business
in
him
that
waxed
mustache
gives
away
the
discussion
having
reached
that
point
where
his
word
would
have
most
effect
steve
gilbert
said
while
opening
the
hearth
to
rap
out
the
ashes
of
his
pipe
sam
wife
heerd
that
he
was
kind
o
thinkin
some
of
into
business
here
if
things
suited
they
all
knew
the
old
man
was
aching
to
tell
something
but
they
purpose
to
gratify
him
by
any
questions
the
rain
dripped
from
the
awning
in
front
and
fell
upon
the
roof
of
the
storeroom
at
the
back
with
a
soft
and
steady
roar
good
the
corn
mcphail
said
after
a
long
pause
purty
cold
though
gilbert
was
tranquil
he
had
a
shot
in
reserve
sam
wife
said
his
wife
said
he
was
thinkin
some
of
goin
into
a
bank
here
a
bank
what
in
thunder
vance
turned
with
a
comical
look
on
his
long
placid
face
one
hand
stroking
his
beard
well
now
gents
i
tell
you
what
the
matter
with
this
town
it
needs
a
bank
yes
sir
i
need
a
bank
you
yes
me
i
did
know
just
what
did
ail
me
but
i
do
now
it
the
need
of
a
bank
that
keeps
me
down
well
you
fellers
can
talk
an
laugh
but
i
tell
yeh
they
a
boom
to
strike
this
town
it
got
to
come
just
look
at
lumberville
their
boom
is
our
was
mcphail
comment
i
do
think
so
said
sanford
who
had
entered
in
time
to
hear
these
last
two
speeches
they
all
looked
at
him
with
deep
interest
he
was
a
smallish
man
he
wore
a
derby
hat
and
a
neat
suit
i
looked
things
over
pretty
close
a
man
do
like
to
invest
his
capital
here
the
rest
looked
at
one
another
till
he
does
and
i
believe
there
an
opening
for
a
bank
as
he
dwelt
upon
the
scheme
from
day
to
day
the
citizens
warmed
to
him
and
he
became
jim
sanford
he
hired
a
little
cottage
and
went
to
housekeeping
at
once
but
the
entire
summer
went
by
before
he
made
his
decision
to
settle
in
fact
it
was
in
the
last
week
of
august
that
the
little
paper
announced
it
in
the
usual
style
james
sanford
popularly
known
as
jim
has
decided
to
open
an
exchange
bank
for
the
convenience
of
our
citizens
who
have
hitherto
been
forced
to
transact
business
in
lumberville
the
thanks
of
the
town
are
due
sanford
who
comes
well
recommended
from
massachusetts
and
from
milwaukee
and
better
still
with
a
bag
of
ducats
will
be
well
patronized
success
jim
the
bank
was
open
by
the
time
the
and
the
hogs
were
being
marketed
and
money
was
received
on
deposit
while
the
carpenters
were
still
at
work
on
the
building
everybody
knew
now
that
he
was
as
solid
as
oak
he
had
taken
into
the
bank
as
bookkeeper
lincoln
bingham
one
of
mcphail
multitudinous
nephews
and
this
was
a
capital
move
everybody
knew
link
and
knew
he
was
a
mcphail
which
meant
that
he
could
be
tied
to
in
all
kinds
o
weather
of
course
the
mcphails
mcilvaines
and
the
rest
of
the
scotch
contingency
banked
on
link
as
old
andrew
mcphail
put
it
link
there
an
he
knows
the
bank
an
books
an
just
how
things
stand
and
so
when
he
sold
his
hogs
he
put
the
whole
sum
over
fifteen
hundred
dollars
into
the
bank
the
mcilvaines
and
the
binghams
did
the
same
and
the
bank
was
at
once
firmly
established
among
the
farmers
only
two
people
held
out
against
sanford
old
freeme
cole
and
bingham
lincoln
mother
but
they
did
count
for
freeme
had
a
cent
and
bingham
was
too
unreasoning
in
her
opposition
she
could
only
say
i
do
like
him
that
all
i
knowed
a
man
back
in
new
york
that
curled
his
mustaches
just
that
way
an
he
no
earthly
good
it
might
have
been
said
by
a
cynic
that
banker
sanford
had
all
the
virtues
of
a
defaulting
bank
cashier
he
had
no
bad
habits
beyond
smoking
he
was
genial
companionable
and
especially
ready
to
help
when
sickness
came
when
old
freeme
cole
got
down
with
delirium
tremens
that
winter
sanford
was
one
of
the
most
heroic
of
nurses
and
the
service
was
so
clearly
disinterested
and
magnanimous
that
every
one
spoke
of
it
his
wife
and
he
were
included
in
every
dance
or
picnic
for
sanford
was
as
great
a
favorite
as
the
banker
himself
she
was
so
sincere
and
her
gray
eyes
were
so
charmingly
frank
and
then
she
said
such
funny
things
i
wish
i
had
something
to
do
besides
housework
it
a
kind
of
a
putterin
job
best
ye
can
do
she
say
merrily
just
to
see
the
others
stare
there
too
much
moppin
an
dustin
seems
if
a
woman
used
up
half
her
life
on
things
that
do
amount
to
anything
do
it
i
tell
yeh
that
feller
a
scallywag
i
know
it
buh
the
way
walks
the
sidewalk
bingham
insisted
to
her
son
who
wished
her
to
put
her
savings
into
the
bank
the
youngest
of
a
large
family
link
had
been
accustomed
all
his
life
to
bingham
many
whimsicalities
i
you
can
smell
he
a
thief
just
as
you
can
tell
when
goin
to
rain
or
the
butter
comin
by
the
smell
well
you
need
laugh
lincoln
i
can
maintained
the
old
lady
stoutly
an
i
ai
goin
to
put
a
red
cent
o
my
money
into
his
pocket
there
where
it
go
to
she
yielded
at
last
and
received
a
little
in
return
for
her
money
jest
about
all
i
ever
get
she
said
privately
and
thereafter
out
of
her
spectacles
with
an
eagle
gaze
she
watched
the
banker
go
by
but
the
banker
seeing
the
dear
old
soul
at
the
window
looking
out
at
him
always
smiled
and
bowed
unaware
of
her
suspicion
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
bought
the
lot
next
his
rented
house
and
began
building
one
of
his
own
a
modest
little
affair
shaped
like
a
with
a
cupola
or
a
cap
a
style
of
architecture
which
became
fashionable
at
once
he
worked
heroically
to
get
the
location
of
the
at
bluff
siding
and
all
but
succeeded
but
tyre
once
their
ally
turned
against
them
and
refused
to
consider
the
fact
of
the
siding
position
at
the
centre
of
the
county
however
for
some
reason
or
other
the
town
woke
up
to
something
of
a
boom
during
the
next
two
years
several
large
farmers
decided
to
retire
and
live
off
the
sweat
of
some
other
fellow
brow
and
so
built
some
houses
of
the
order
and
moved
into
town
this
inflow
of
moneyed
men
from
the
country
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
a
seminary
of
learning
on
the
hillside
where
the
soldiers
home
was
to
be
located
this
called
in
more
farmers
from
the
country
and
a
new
hotel
was
built
a
factory
followed
and
burt
mcphail
set
up
a
all
this
improvement
unquestionably
dated
from
the
opening
of
the
bank
and
the
most
unreasoning
partisans
of
the
banker
held
him
to
be
the
chief
cause
of
the
resulting
development
of
the
town
though
he
himself
modestly
disclaimed
any
hand
in
the
affair
had
bluff
siding
been
a
city
the
highest
civic
honors
would
have
been
open
to
banker
sanford
indeed
his
name
was
repeatedly
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
county
offices
no
gentlemen
he
explained
firmly
but
courteously
in
wilson
store
one
night
i
a
banker
not
a
politician
i
ca
ride
two
horses
in
the
second
year
of
the
bank
history
he
went
up
to
the
north
part
of
the
state
on
business
visiting
west
superior
duluth
ashland
and
other
booming
towns
and
came
back
full
of
the
wonders
of
what
he
saw
there
big
money
up
there
nell
he
said
to
his
wife
but
she
had
the
woman
tendency
to
hold
fast
to
what
she
had
and
would
not
listen
to
any
plans
about
moving
build
up
your
business
here
jim
and
do
worry
about
what
good
chances
there
are
somewhere
else
he
said
no
more
about
it
but
he
took
great
interest
in
all
the
news
the
boys
brought
back
from
their
annual
up
north
they
were
all
enthusiastic
over
west
superior
and
duluth
and
their
wonderful
development
was
the
theme
of
discussion
in
wilson
store
ii
the
first
two
years
of
the
bank
history
were
solidly
successful
and
jim
and
nellie
were
the
head
and
front
of
all
good
works
and
the
provoking
cause
of
most
of
the
fun
no
one
seemed
more
we
consider
ourselves
just
as
young
as
anybody
sanford
would
say
when
joked
about
going
out
with
the
young
people
so
much
but
sometimes
at
home
after
the
children
were
asleep
she
sighed
a
little
jim
i
wish
you
was
in
some
kind
of
a
business
so
i
could
help
i
have
enough
to
do
i
i
could
mop
an
dust
an
dust
an
mop
but
it
seems
sinful
to
waste
time
that
way
ca
i
do
anything
jim
why
no
if
you
to
the
children
and
keep
house
that
all
anybody
asks
of
you
she
was
silent
but
not
convinced
she
had
a
desire
to
do
something
outside
the
walls
of
her
house
a
desire
transmitted
to
her
from
her
father
for
a
woman
inherits
these
things
in
the
spring
of
the
second
year
a
number
of
the
depositors
drew
out
money
to
invest
in
duluth
and
superior
lots
and
the
whole
town
was
excited
over
the
matter
the
summer
passed
link
and
sanford
spending
their
time
in
the
bank
that
is
when
not
out
swimming
or
fishing
with
the
boys
but
july
and
august
were
terribly
hot
and
dry
and
oats
and
corn
were
only
and
the
farmers
were
grumbling
some
of
them
were
forced
to
draw
on
the
bank
instead
of
depositing
mcphail
came
in
one
day
in
november
to
draw
a
thousand
dollars
to
pay
for
a
house
and
lot
he
had
recently
bought
sanford
was
alone
he
whistled
phew

at
me

in
link
gone
down
to
the
city
to
get

said
mcphail
any
time
goin

snow
looks
like

i
haf
to
load
a
lot
o
ready
biz
about
an
hour
later
old
lady
bingham
burst
upon
the
banker
wild
and
breathless
i
want

money
she
announced
bingham
pleasant
i
want

where
lincoln
she
had
read
that
morning
of
two
bank
failures
one
in
nova
scotia
and
one
in
massachusetts
and
they
seemed
providential
warnings
to
her
lincoln
absence
confirmed
them
he
gone
to
paul
wo
be
back
till
the
train
do
you
need
some

sanford
saw

tried
to
explain
i
sent
your
son
to
paul
after
some
money
where
my
money
what
have
you
done
with
that
in
her
excitement
she
thought
of
her
money
just
as
she
hand
handed
it
in
silver
and
little
rolls
and
wads
of
bills
if
you
let
me
explain
i
do
want
you
to
explain
nawthin
jest
hand
me
out
my
money
two
or
three
loafers
seeing
her
gesticulate
stopped
on
the
walk
outside
and
looked
in
at
the
door
sanford
was
annoyed
but
he
remained
calm
and
persuasive
he
saw
that
something
had
caused
a
panic
in
the
good
simple
old
woman
he
wished
for
lincoln
as
one
wishes
for
a
policeman
sometimes
now
bingham
if
you
only
wait
till
lincoln
i
do
want
wait
i
want
my
money

fifty
dollars

he
tried
to
quiet
her
i
mean
i
ca
give
you
your
money
why
ca
you
she
stormed
trotting
nervously
on
her
feet
as
she
stood
there
because
if
you
let
me
explain
we
do
keep
the
money
just
as
it
comes
to
us
we
pay
it
out
and
take
in
other
bingham
was
getting
more
and
more
bewildered
she
now
had
only
one
clear
idea
she
could
get
her
money
her
voice
grew
tearful
like
an
angry
child
i
want
my
money
i
knew
you
steal
it
that
i
worked
for
give
me
my
money
sanford
hastily
handed
her
some
money
here
fifty
dollars
you
can
have
the
rest
when
the
old
lady
clutched
the
money
and
literally
ran
out
of
the
door
and
went
off
up
the
sidewalk
talking
incoherently
to
every
one
she
met
she
told
her
story
but
the
men
smiled
and
passed
on
they
had
heard
her
predictions
of
calamity
before
but
mcilvaine
was
made
a
trifle
uneasy
by
it
he
would
give
you
money
or
did
he
say
he
could
she
inquired
in
her
moderate
way
he
could
an
he
would
she
said
if
you
got
any
money
there
you
better
get
it
out
quick
it
ai
safe
a
minute
when
lincoln
comes
home
i
goin
to
see
if
i
ca
well
i
was
to
go
to
lumberville
this
week
anyway
to
buy
a
carpet
and
a
chamber
set
i
guess
i
might
well
get
the
money
when
she
came
in
and
demanded
the
money
sanford
was
scared
were
these
two
old
women
the
beginning
of
the
deluge
would
mcphail
insist
on
being
paid
also
there
was
just
one
hundred
dollars
left
in
the
bank
together
with
a
little
silver
with
rare
strategy
he
smiled
certainly
mcilvaine
how
much
will
you
need
she
had
intended
to
demand
the
whole
of
her
deposit
one
hundred
and
seventeen
dollars
but
his
readiness
mollified
her
a
little
i
did
i
take
the
hull
but
i
guess
dollars
do
he
paid
the
money
briskly
out
over
the
little
glass
shelf
how
is
your
children
mrs
mcilvaine
purty
well
thanky
replied
mcilvaine
laboriously
counting
the
bills
is
it
all
right
i
guess
so
she
replied
dubiously
i
count
it
after
i
get
home
she
went
up
the
street
with
the
feeling
that
the
bank
was
all
right
and
she
stepped
in
and
told
bingham
that
she
had
no
trouble
in
getting
her
money
after
she
had
gone
sanford
sat
down
and
wrote
a
telegram
which
he
sent
to
paul
this
telegram
according
to
the
duplicate
at
the
station
read
in
this
puzzling
way
exchange

no
all
out
of
paper

hundred
and
envelopes
to
match

brisk
press

sanford
two
or
three
others
came
in
after
a
little
money
but
he
put
them
off
easily
just
been
cashing
some
paper
and
took
all
the
ready
cash
i
can

ca

down
to
paul
to

back
on
the
nine
sure
an
old
norwegian
woman
came
in
to
deposit
ten
dollars
and
he
counted
it
in
briskly
and
put
the
amount
down
on
her
little
book
for
her
barney
mace
came
in
to
deposit
a
hundred
dollars
the
proceeds
of
a
horse
sale
and
this
helped
him
through
the
day
those
who
wanted
small
sums
he
paid
glad
this
ai
a
big
demand
rather
close
on
cash
he
said
smiling
as
lincoln

came
in
she
laughed

i
do
know
much
about
banking

said
vance
but
i
it
a
good
same
as

a
man

o
cash
first
they
know
got
a
cent
to
spare
that
the
idea
exactly
credit
all
right
plenty
o
property
but
and
he
smiled
and
went
at
his
books
the
smile
died
out
of
his
eyes
as
vance
went
out
and
he
pulled
a
little
morocco
book
from
his
pocket
and
began
studying
the
beautiful
columns
of
figures
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
filled
those
he
compared
with
the
books
with
great
care
thrusting
the
book
out
of
sight
when
any
one
entered
he
closed
the
bank
as
usual
at
five
lincoln
had
not
come
could
come
now
till
the
accommodation
for
an
hour
after
the
shades
were
drawn
he
sat
there
in
the
silently
pondering
on
his
situation
this
attitude
and
deep
quiet
were
unusual
to
him
he
heard
the
feet
of
friends
and
neighbors
passing
the
door
as
he
sat
there
by
the
smouldering
in
the
growing
darkness
there
was
something
impressive
in
his
attitude
he
started
up
at
last
and
tried
to
see
what
the
hour
was
by
turning
the
face
of
his
watch
to
the
dull
glow
from
the
open
door
he
said
and
threw
the
whole
matter
off
as
if
he
had
decided
it
or
had
put
off
the
decision
till
another
time
as
he
went
by
the
vance
said
to
mcilvaine
in
a
smiling
way
as
if
it
were
a
good
joke
on
sanford
little
short
o
cash
down
at
the
bank
he
a
good
fellow
mcilvaine
said
so
his
wife
added
vance
with
a
chuckle
iii
that
night
after
supper
sanford
sat
in
his
snug
little
with
a
baby
on
each
knee
looking
as
cheerful
and
happy
as
any
man
in
the
village
the
children
crowed
and
shouted
as
he
trotted
them
to
boston
or
rode
them
on
the
toe
of
his
boot
they
made
a
noisy
merry
group
sanford
did
her
own
work
and
her
swift
feet
could
be
heard
moving
to
and
fro
out
in
the
kitchen
it
was
pleasant
there
the
woodwork
the
furniture
the
stove
the
curtains
all
had
that
look
of
newness
just
growing
into
coziness
the
was
lighted
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
after
the
work
in
the
kitchen
was
done
sanford
came
in
and
sat
awhile
by
the
fire
with
the
children
looking
very
wifely
in
her
dark
dress
and
white
apron
her
round
smiling
face
glowing
with
love
and
pride
the
gloating
look
of
a
mother
seeing
her
children
in
the
arms
of
her
husband
how
is
peterson
baby
jim
she
said
suddenly
her
face
sobering
pretty
bad
i
guess
la
la
la
the
doctor
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
tight
squeak
if
it
lived
guess
it
done
for
oop
goes
she
made
a
little
leap
at
the
youngest
child
and
clasped
it
convulsively
to
her
bosom
her
swift
maternal
imagination
had
made
another
loss
very
near
and
terrible
oh
say
nell
he
broke
out
on
seeing
her
sober
i
had
the
confoundedest
time
with
old
lady
bingham
baby
gone
to
sleep
after
the
children
had
been
put
to
bed
in
the
little
alcove
off
the
sanford
came
back
to
find
jim
absorbed
over
a
little
book
of
accounts
what
are
you
studying
jim
some
one
knocked
on
the
door
before
he
had
time
to
reply
come
in
he
said
sh
do
yell
so
his
wife
whispered
telegram
jim
said
a
voice
in
the
obscurity
oh

a
lathy
fellow
with
a
quid
in
his
cheek
stepped
in
how

down
ca
stop
sanford
tore
the
envelope
open
read
the
telegram
rapidly
the
smile
fading
out
of
his
face
he
read
it
again
word
for
word
then
sat
looking
at
it
any
answer
asked
sam
no
all
right
after
the
door
slammed
sanford
took
the
sheet
from
the
envelope
and
reread
it
at
length
he
dropped
into
his
chair
that
settles
it
he
said
aloud
settles
what

the
news
his
wife
came
up
and
looked
over
his
shoulder

the
morning
train
yes

guess
so
i
mean
of
course
i
have
to
be
to
open
the
bank
sanford
looked
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
in
silence
there
was
something
in
his
look
and
especially
in
his
tone
that
troubled
her
what
do
you
mean
jim
you
do
intend
to
come
back
she
took
his
arm
what
the
matter
now
tell
me
what
are
you
going
away
for
he
knew
he
could
not
deceive
his
wife
ears
and
eyes
just
then
so
he
remained
silent
we
got
to
leave
nell
he
admitted
at
last
why
what
for
because
i
broke
gone
up
the
spout
and
all
the
rest
he
said
desperately
with
an
attempt
at
fun
bingham
and
mcilvaine

me
dead
why
why
what
has
become
of
the
money
all
the
money
the
people

there
gone
up
with
the
rest
what
you
done
with
it
i
do
well
i
invested
it
and
lost
it
james
gordon
sanford
she
exclaimed
trying
to
realize
it
was
that
right
ai
that
a
case
of
of
should
wonder
a
case
of
embezzlement
such
as
you
read
of
in
the
newspapers
his
tone
was
easy
but
he
avoided
the
look
in
his
beautiful
gray
eyes
but
it
stealing
ai
it
she
stared
at
him
bewildered
by
his
reckless
lightness
of
mood
it
is
now
because
i
lost
if
i
won
it
it
been
financial
shrewdness
she
asked
her
next
question
after
a
pause
in
a
low
voice
and
through
teeth
almost
set
did
you
go
into
this
bank
to
steal
this
money
tell
me
that
no
i
did
nell
i
ai
quite
up
to
that
his
answer
softened
her
a
little
and
she
sat
looking
at
him
steadily
as
he
went
on
the
tears
began
to
roll
slowly
down
her
cheeks
her
hands
were
clenched
the
fact
is
the
idea
came
into
my
head
last
fall
when
i
went
up
to
superior
my
partner
wanted
me
to
go
in
with
him
on
some
land
and
i
did
we
speculated
on
the
growth
of
the
town
toward
the
south
we
made
a
strike
then
he
wanted
me
to
go
in
on
a
of
course
i
expected
as
he
went
on
with
the
usual
excuses
her
mind
made
all
the
allowances
possible
for
him
he
had
always
been
boyish
impulsive
and
lacking
in
judgment
and
strength
of
character
she
was
humiliated
and
frightened
but
she
loved
and
sympathized
with
him
her
silence
alarmed
him
and
he
made
excuses
for
himself
he
was
speculating
for
her
sake
more
than
for
his
own
and
so
on
choo
choo
whistled
the
train
through
the
still
air
he
sprang
up
and
reached
for
his
coat
she
seized
his
arm
again
where
are
you
going
she
sternly
asked
to
take
that
train
when
are
you
coming
back
i
do
know
but
his
tone
said
never
she
felt
it
her
face
grew
bitter
going
to
leave
me
and
the
babies
i
send
for
you
soon
come
he
tried
to
put
his
arm
about
her
she
stepped
back
jim
if
you
leave
me
choo
choo
whistled
the
engine
you
leave
me
forever
there
was
a
terrible
resolution
in
her
tone
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
going
to
stay
here
if
you
go
i
never
be
your
wife
again
never
she
glanced
at
the
sleeping
children
and
her
chin
trembled
i
ca
face
those
fellows
they
kill
me
he
said
in
a
sullen
tone
no
they
wo
they
respect
you
if
you
stay
and
tell
exactly
how
it
all
is
you
disgraced
me
and
my
children
that
what
done
if
you
do
stay
the
clear
jangle
of
the
sounded
through
the
night
as
with
the
whiz
of
escaping
steam
and
scrape
and
jar
of
gripping
brakes
and
howl
of
wheels
the
train
came
to
a
stop
at
the
station
sanford
dropped
his
coat
and
sat
down
again
i
have
to
stay
now
his
tone
was
dry
and
lifeless
it
had
a
reproach
in
it
that
cut
the
wife
deep
deep
as
the
fountain
of
tears
and
she
went
across
the
room
and
knelt
at
the
bedside
burying
her
face
in
the
clothes
on
the
feet
of
her
children
and
sobbed
silently
the
man
sat
with
bent
head
looking
into
the
glowing
coal
whistling
through
his
teeth
a
look
of
sullen
resignation
and
endurance
on
his
face
that
had
never
been
there
before
his
very
attitude
was
alien
and
ominous
neither
spoke
for
a
long
time
at
last
he
rose
and
began
taking
off
his
coat
and
vest
well
i
suppose
there
nothing
to
do
but
go
to
bed
she
did
not
stir
she
might
have
been
asleep
so
far
as
any
sound
or
motion
was
concerned
he
went
off
to
the
bed
in
the
little
parlor
and
she
still
knelt
there
her
heart
full
of
anger
bitterness
sorrow
the
sunny
uneventfulness
of
her
past
life
made
this
great
storm
the
more
terrifying
her
trust
in
her
husband
had
been
absolute
a
daughter
the
bank
clerk
had
seemed
to
her
the
equal
of
any
gentleman
in
the
world
her
world
and
when
she
knew
his
delicacy
his
unfailing
kindness
and
his
abounding
good
nature
she
had
accepted
him
as
the
father
of
her
children
and
this
was
the
first
revelation
to
her
of
his
inherent
moral
weakness
her
mind
went
over
the
whole
ground
again
and
again
in
a
sort
of
blinding
rush
she
was
convinced
of
his
lack
of
honor
more
by
his
tone
his
inflections
than
by
his
words
his
lack
of
deep
regret
his
readiness
to
leave
her
to
bear
the
whole
shock
of
the
discovery
these
were
in
his
flippant
tones
and
every
time
she
thought
of
them
the
hot
blood
surged
over
her
at
such
moments
she
hated
him
and
her
white
teeth
clenched
to
these
moods
succeeded
others
when
she
remembered
his
smile
the
dimple
in
his
chin
his
tender
care
for
the
sick
his
buoyancy
his
songs
to
the
children
how
could
he
sit
there
with
the
children
on
his
knees
and
plan
to
run
away
leaving
them
disgraced
she
went
to
bed
at
last
with
the
babies
and
with
their
soft
warm
little
bodies
touching
her
side
fell
asleep
pondering
suffering
as
only
a
mother
and
wife
can
suffer
when
distrust
and
doubt
of
her
husband
supplant
confidence
and
adoration
iv
the
children
awakened
her
by
their
delighted
cooing
and
kissing
it
was
a
great
event
this
waking
to
find
mamma
in
their
bed
it
was
hardly
light
of
a
dull
gray
morning
and
with
the
children
tumbling
about
over
her
feeling
the
pressure
of
the
warm
little
hands
and
soft
lips
she
went
over
the
whole
situation
again
and
at
last
settled
upon
her
action
she
rose
shook
down
the
coal
in
the
stove
in
the
and
started
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
then
she
dressed
the
children
by
the
the
elder
of
them
as
soon
as
dressed
ran
in
to
wake
poppa
while
the
mother
went
about
sanford
came
out
of
his
bedroom
unwontedly
gloomy
greeting
the
children
in
a
subdued
maimer
he
shivered
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
and
stirred
the
stove
as
if
he
thought
the
room
was
cold
his
face
was
pale
and
moist
breakfast
is
ready
james
called
sanford
in
a
tone
which
she
meant
to
be
habitual
but
which
had
a
cadence
of
sadness
in
it
someway
he
found
it
hard
to
look
at
her
as
he
came
out
she
busied
herself
with
placing
the
children
at
the
table
in
order
to
conceal
her
own
emotion
i
do
believe
i
eat
any
meat
this
morning
nellie
i
ai
very
well
she
glanced
at
him
quickly
keenly
what
the
matter
i
my
stomach
is
kind
of
upset
by
this
failure
o
mine
i
in
great
shape
to
go
down
to
the
bank
this
morning
and
face
them
fellows
it
got
to
be
done
i
know
it
but
that
do
help
me
any
he
tried
to
smile
she
mused
while
the
baby
hammered
on
his
tin
plate
you
got
to
go
down
if
you
do
i
will
said
she
resolutely
and
you
must
say
that
that
money
will
be
paid
back
every
cent
but
that
i
can
do
it
must
be
done
but
under
the
law
there
nothing
can
make
this
thing
right
except
paying
every
cent
we
owe
i
ai
to
have
it
said
that
my
children
that
i
on
somebody
else
if
you
do
pay
these
debts
i
will
i
thought
it
all
out
if
you
do
stay
and
face
it
and
pay
these
men
i
wo
own
you
as
my
husband
i
loved
and
trusted
you
jim
i
thought
you
was
honorable
it
been
a
terrible
blow
but
i
decided
it
all
in
my
mind
she
conquered
her
little
weakness
and
went
on
to
the
end
firmly
her
face
looked
pale
there
was
a
square
look
about
the
mouth
and
chin
the
iron
resolution
and
puritanic
strength
of
her
father
old
john
foreman
had
come
to
the
surface
her
look
and
tone
mastered
the
man
for
he
loved
her
deeply
she
had
set
him
a
hard
task
and
when
he
rose
and
went
down
the
street
he
walked
with
bent
head
quite
unlike
his
usual
self
there
were
not
many
men
on
the
street
it
seemed
earlier
than
it
was
for
it
was
a
raw
cold
morning
promising
snow
the
sun
was
completely
masked
in
a
seamless
cloud
he
met
vance
with
a
brown
parcel
beefsteak
for
breakfast
under
his
arm
hello

of
arrived
at
the
bank
he
let
himself
in
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
few
minutes
then
went
behind
the
railing
and
sat
down
he
did
build
a
fire
though
it
was
cold
and
damp
and
he
shivered
as
he
sat
leaning
on
the
desk
at
length
he
drew
a
large
sheet
of
paper
toward
him
and
wrote
something
on
it
in
a
heavy
hand
he
was
writing
on
this
when
lincoln
entered
at
the
back
whistling
boyishly
hello
jim
ai
you
up
early
no
fire
eh
he
rattled
at
the
stove
sanford
said
nothing
but
finished
his
writing
then
he
said
quietly
you
need
build
a
fire
on
my
account
link
why

i
used
up
what

matter

sick
and
the
business

gone
to
the
devil
he
looked
out
of
the
window
link
dropped
the
poker
and
came
around
behind
the
counter
and
stared
at
sanford
with
fallen
mouth
wha
you
say
i
said
the
business
had
gone
to
the
devil
broke
petered
gone
up
the
spout
he
took
a
sort
of
morbid
pleasure
in
saying
these
things
what
us
have
i
been
speculatin
in
copper
my
partner
me
link
came
closer
his
mouth
stiffened
and
an
ominous
look
came
into
his
eyes
you
do
mean
to
say
you
lost
my
money
and
mother
and
uncle
andrew
and
all
the
rest
sanford
was
getting
it
what
the
use
i
tell
you
yes
it
all
gone
every
cent
of
it
link
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
as
he
sat
at
the
desk
sanford
tone
enraged
him
you
thief
but

me
back
or
i
oh

a
sick
man

good
said
sanford
with
a
peculiar
recklessness
of
lifeless
misery
pay
out
of
the
safe
here
the
combination
lincoln
released
him
and
began
turning
the
knob
of
the
door
at
last
it
swung
open
and
he
searched
the
less
than
forty
dollars
all
told
his
voice
was
full
of
helpless
rage
as
he
turned
at
last
and
walked
up
close
to
sanford
bowed
head
i
like
to
pound
the
life
out
o
you
you
at
liberty
to
do
so
if
it
be
any
satisfaction
this
desperate
courage
awed
the
younger
man
he
gazed
at
sanford
in
amazement
if
you
cool
down
and
wait
a
little
link
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
sick
as
a
horse
i
guess
i
go
home
you
can
put
this
up
in
the
window
and
go
home
too
if
you
want
to
lincoln
saw
that
sanford
was
sick
he
was
shivering
and
drops
of
sweat
were
on
his
white
forehead
lincoln
stood
aside
silently
and
let
him
go
out
better
lock
up
link
you
ca
do
anything
by
staying
here
lincoln
took
refuge
in
a
boyish
phrase
that
would
have
made
any
one
but
a
sick
man
laugh
well
this
is
a
of
a
note
he
took
up
the
paper
it
read
bank
closed
to
my
creditors
and
depositors
through
a
combination
of
events
i
find
myself
obliged
to
temporarily
suspend
payment
i
ask
the
depositors
to
be
patient
and
their
claims
will
be
met
i
think
i
can
pay
cents
on
the
dollar
if
given
a
little
time
i
shall
not
run
away
i
shall
stay
right
here
till
all
matters
are
honorably
settled
james
sanford
lincoln
hastily
pinned
this
paper
to
the
so
that
it
could
be
seen
from
without
then
pulled
down
the
blinds
and
locked
the
door
his
nature
rose
superior
to
his
rage
for
the
moment
there
be
the
devil
to
pay
in
this
burg
before
two
hours
he
slipped
out
the
back
way
taking
the
keys
with
him
i
go
and
tell
uncle
and
then
we
see
if
jim
ca
turn
in
the
house
on
our
account
he
thought
as
he
harnessed
a
team
to
drive
out
to
mcphail
the
first
man
to
try
the
door
was
an
old
norwegian
in
a
spotted
mackinac
jacket
and
a
fur
cap
with
the
inevitable
little
red
tippet
about
his
neck
he
turned
the
knob
knocked
and
at
last
saw
the
writing
which
he
could
not
read
and
went
away
to
tell
johnson
that
the
bank
was
closed
johnson
thought
nothing
special
of
that
it
was
early
and
they
very
particular
to
open
on
time
anyway
then
the
barber
across
the
street
tried
to
get
in
to
have
a
bill
changed
trying
to
peer
in
the
window
he
saw
the
notice
which
he
read
with
a
grin
one
o
link
jobs
he
explained
to
the
fellows
in
the
shop
he
too
darned
lazy
to
open
on
time
so
he
puts
up
notice
that
the
bank
is
let
go
and
see
do
do
it
he
watchin
to
see
us
all
rush
across
and
look
just
keep
quiet
and
see
the
solid
citizens
rear
around
old
orrin
mcilvaine
came
out
of
the
and
tried
the
door
next
then
stood
for
a
long
time
reading
the
notice
and
at
last
walked
thoughtfully
away
soon
he
returned
to
the
merriment
of
the
fellows
in
the
barber
shop
with
two
or
three
solid
citizens
who
had
been
smoking
an
cigar
and
planning
a
they
stood
before
the
window
in
a
row
and
read
the
notice
mcilvaine
gesticulated
with
his
cigar
gentlemen
there
a
pig
loose
here
one
o
link
jokes
i
reckon
but
that
sanford
writin
an
here
it
is
nine
and
no
one
round
i
do
like
the
looks
of
it
myself
the
crowd
thickened
the
fellows
came
out
of
the
blacksmith
shop
while
the
jokers
in
the
barber
shop
smote
their
knees
and
yelled
with
merriment
what
up
queried
vance
coming
up
and
repeating
the
universal
question
mcilvaine
pointed
at
the
poster
with
his
cigar
vance
read
the
notice
while
the
crowd
waited
silently
what
ye
think
of
it
asked
some
one
impatiently
vance
smoked
a
moment
ca
say
where
jim
that
it
where
is
he
best
way
to
find
out
is
to
send
a
boy
up
to
the
house
he
called
a
boy
and
sent
him
scurrying
up
the
street
the
crowd
now
grew
sober
and
discussed
possibilities
if
that
true
it
the
worst
crack
on
the
head
i
ever
had
said
mcilvaine
seventeen
hundred
dollars
is
my
pile
in
there
he
took
a
seat
on
the
well
i
tickled
to
death
to
think
i
got
my
little
stake
out
before
anything
happened
when
you
think
of
it
what
security
did
he
ever
give
mcilvaine
continued
not
a
cent
not
a
red
cent
no
sir
we
simply
banked
on
him
now
he
a
good
fellow
an
this
may
be
a
joke
o
link
but
the
fact
is
it
might
happened
well
sonny
he
said
to
the
boy
who
came
running
up
link
ai
to
home
an
sanford
she
says
jim
sick
an
ca
come
down
there
was
a
silence
anybody
see
him
this
morning
asked
wilson
yes
i
saw
him
said
vance
looked
bad
too
the
crowd
changed
people
came
and
went
some
to
get
news
some
to
carry
it
away
in
a
short
time
the
whole
town
knew
the
bank
had
all
to
smash
farmers
drove
along
and
stopped
to
find
out
what
it
all
meant
the
more
they
talked
the
more
excited
they
grew
and
scoundrel
and
i
always
had
my
doubts
of
that
feller
were
phrases
growing
more
frequent
the
list
of
the
victims
grew
until
it
was
evident
that
nearly
all
of
the
savings
of
a
dozen
or
more
depositors
were
swallowed
up
and
the
sum
reached
was
nearly
twenty
thousand
dollars
what
did
he
do
with
it
was
the
question
he
never
gambled
or
drank
he
lived
frugally
there
was
no
apparent
cause
for
this
failure
of
a
trusted
institution
it
was
beginning
to
snow
in
great
damp
driving
flakes
which
melted
as
they
fell
giving
to
the
street
a
strangeness
and
gloom
that
were
impressive
the
men
left
the
sidewalk
at
last
and
gathered
in
the
saloons
and
stores
to
continue
the
discussion
the
crowd
at
the
railroad
saloon
was
very
decided
in
its
belief
sanford
had
pocketed
the
money
and
skipped
that
yarn
about
his
being
at
home
sick
was
a
blind
some
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
was
almighty
curious
where
link
was
hinting
darkly
that
the
bank
ought
to
be
broken
into
and
so
on
upon
this
company
burst
barney
and
sam
mace
from
hogan
corners
they
were
excited
by
the
news
and
already
inflamed
with
drink
say
yelled
barney
any
o
you
fellers
know
anything
about
jim
sanford
no
why
got
any
money
there
yes
and
i
goin
to
git
it
out
if
i
haf
to
smash
the
door
in
that
the
talk
shouted
some
of
the
loafers
they
sprang
up
and
surrounded
barney
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
aroused
all
their
latent
ferocity
i
goin
to
get
into
that
bank
an
see
how
things
look
an
then
i
goin
to
find
sanford
an
get
my
money
or
pound
out
of
one
o
the
six
go
find
him
first
he
up
home
sick
so
his
wife
i
see
whether
he
sick
not
i
drag
out
by
the
scruff
the
neck
come
on
he
ended
with
a
sudden
resolution
leading
the
way
out
into
the
street
where
the
falling
snow
was
softening
the
dirt
into
a
sticky
mud
a
rabble
of
a
dozen
or
two
of
men
and
boys
followed
mace
up
the
street
he
led
the
way
with
great
strides
shouting
his
threats
as
they
passed
along
women
thrust
their
heads
out
at
the
windows
asking
what
the
matter
and
some
one
answered
each
time
in
a
voice
of
unconcealed
delight
sanford
stole
all
the
money
in
the
bank
and
they
goin
up
to
lick
come
on
if
ye
want
to
see
the
fun
in
a
few
moments
the
street
looked
as
if
an
alarm
of
fire
had
been
sounded
half
the
town
seemed
to
be
out
and
the
other
half
coming
women
in
shawls
like
squaws
children
capering
and
laughing
young
men
grinning
at
the
girls
who
came
out
and
stood
at
the
gates
some
of
the
citizens
tried
to
stop
it
vance
found
the
constable
looking
on
and
ordered
him
to
do
his
duty
and
stop
that
crowd
i
ca
do
anything
he
said
helplessly
they
ai
done
yet
an
i
do
know
oh
git
out
they
goin
up
there
to
whale
jim
an
you
know
it
if
you
do
stop
i
telephone
the
sheriff
and
have
you
arrested
with
under
this
pressure
the
constable
ran
along
after
the
crowd
in
an
attempt
to
stop
it
he
reached
them
as
they
stood
about
the
little
porch
of
the
house
packed
closely
around
barney
and
sam
who
said
nothing
but
followed
barney
like
his
shadow
if
the
sun
had
been
shining
it
might
not
have
happened
as
it
did
but
there
was
a
a
weird
shed
by
the
thick
sky
and
falling
snow
which
somehow
encouraged
the
enraged
ruffians
who
pounded
on
the
door
just
as
the
pleading
voice
of
the
constable
was
heard
hold
on
gentlemen
this
is
the
law
law
to
said
some
one
this
is
a
case
something
besides
law
open
up
there
roared
the
raucous
voice
of
barney
mace
as
he
pounded
at
the
door
fiercely
the
door
opened
and
the
wife
appeared
one
child
in
her
arms
the
other
at
her
side
what
do
you
want
where
that
banker
tell
the
thief
to
come
out
here
we
want
to
talk
with
him
the
woman
did
not
quail
but
her
face
seemed
a
ghastly
yellow
seen
through
the
falling
snow
he
ca
come
he
sick
sick
we
sick
tell
t
come
out
or
we
snake
out
by
the
heels
the
crowd
laughed
the
worst
elements
of
the
saloons
surrounded
the
two
men
it
was
amusing
to
them
to
see
the
woman
face
them
all
in
that
way
where
mcphail
vance
inquired
anxiously
somebody
find
mcphail
stand
out
o
the
way
snarled
barney
as
he
pushed
the
struggling
woman
aside
the
wife
raised
her
voice
to
that
wild
pitch
a
woman
uses
when
desperate
i
do
it
i
tell
you
help
keep
out
o
my
way
or
i
wring
neck
yeh
she
struggled
with
him
but
he
pushed
her
aside
and
entered
the
room
what
goin
on
here
called
the
ringing
voice
of
andrew
mcphail
who
had
just
driven
up
with
link
several
of
the
crowd
looked
over
their
shoulders
at
mcphail
hello
mac
just
in
time
oh
nawthin
barney
callin
on
the
banker
that
all
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
packed
struggling
about
the
door
came
the
woman
scream
again
mcphail
dashed
around
the
crowd
running
two
or
three
of
them
down
and
entered
the
back
door
vance
mcilvaine
and
lincoln
followed
him
cowards
the
wife
said
as
the
ruffians
approached
the
bed
they
swept
her
aside
but
paused
an
instant
before
the
glance
of
the
sick
man
eye
he
lay
there
desperately
deathly
sick
the
blood
throbbed
in
his
whirling
brain
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
blinded
his
strength
was
gone
he
could
hardly
speak
he
partly
rose
and
stretched
out
his
hand
and
then
fell
back
kill
me
if
you
want
to
but
let
her
alone
she
the
children
were
crying
the
wind
whistled
drearily
across
the
room
carrying
the
evanescent
flakes
of
soft
snow
over
the
heads
of
the
pausing
listening
crowd
in
the
doorway
quick
steps
were
heard
hold
on
there
cried
mcphail
as
he
burst
into
the
room
he
seemed
an
angel
of
god
to
the
wife
and
mother
he
spread
his
great
arms
in
a
gesture
which
suggested
irresistible
strength
and
resolution
clear
out
out
with
ye
no
man
had
ever
seen
him
look
like
that
before
he
awed
them
with
the
look
in
his
eyes
his
long
service
as
sheriff
gave
him
authority
he
hustled
them
cuffed
them
out
of
the
door
like
barney
backed
out
cursing
he
knew
mcphall
too
well
to
refuse
to
obey
mcphail
pushed
barney
out
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
on
the
steps
looking
at
the
crowd
well
you
a
great
lot
you
fellers
would
ye
jump
on
a
sick
man
what
ye
think

the
crowd
laughed

he
replied
that

barney

out
of
his
hide

be
the
man
but
i
want

dead
loss
that
so
shouted
somebody
mac
ai
no
fool
if
he
does
chaw
hay
said
another
and
the
crowd
laughed
they
were
losing
that
frenzy
largely
imitative
and
involuntary
which
actuates
a
mob
there
was
something
counteracting
in
the
cool
humorous
tone
give
us
the
rest
of
it
mac
the
rest
of
it
is
clear
out
o
here
i
boot
every
mother
son
of
yeh
ca
do
it
come
down
an
try
it
mcilvaine
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
mac
sanford
wants
to
say
something
if
it
safe
safe
as
eatin
dinner
sanford
came
out
looking
pale
and
almost
like
a
child
as
she
stood
beside
her
defender
towering
bulk
but
her
face
was
resolute
that
money
will
be
paid
back
she
said
dollar
for
dollar
if
just
give
us
a
chance
as
soon
as
jim
gets
well
enough
every
cent
will
be
paid
if
i
live
the
crowd
received
this
little
speech
in
silence
one
or
two
said
in
low
voices
that
business
she
do
it
too
if
any
one
can
barney
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
with
contemptuous
curses
the
she
will
he
said
we
see
you
have
a
chance
mcphall
and
mcilvaine
assured
sanford
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
now
git
said
andrew
coming
down
the
steps
the
crowd
scattered
with
laughing
taunts
he
turned
and
entered
the
house
the
rest
drifted
off
down
the
street
through
the
soft
flurries
of
snow
and
in
a
few
moments
the
street
assumed
its
usual
appearance
the
failure
of
the
bank
and
the
raid
on
the
banker
had
passed
into
history
v
in
the
light
of
the
days
of
calm
afterthought
which
followed
this
attempt
upon
the
peace
of
the
sanford
home
grew
more
monstrous
and
helped
largely
to
mitigate
the
feeling
against
the
banker
besides
he
had
not
run
away
that
was
a
strong
point
in
his
favor
do
that
show
argued
vance
in
the
do
that
show
he
did
intend
to
steal
an
do
it
show
he
goin
to
try
to
make
things
square
i
guess
we
might
as
well
think
that
as
anything
i
claim
the
boys
has
a
right
t
take
sumpthin
out
o
his
hide
bent
wilson
stubbornly
insisted
ai
enough
t
go
laughed
mcphail
besides
i
ca
have
it
link
an
i
own
the
biggest
share
in
an
we
ca
have
him
hurt
mcilvaine
and
vance
grinned
that
a
fact
mac
we
four
fellers
are
the
main
losers
he
ours
an
we
ca
have
him
foundered
crippled
cut
up
in
any
way
ai
that
woman
of
his
gritty
gritty
ai
no
name
for
her
she
goin
into
business
so
i
hear
they
say
jim

little
yesterday

been
able
to
look
at
a
book
since
say
ai
it
a
little
curious
he
was
so
sick
just
then
sick
as
a
dog
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
a
manner
most
comically
significant
the
thought
of
poison
was
in
the
mind
of
each
it
was
under
these
trying
circumstances
that
sanford
began
to
crawl
about
a
week
or
ten
days
after
his
sickness
it
was
really
the
most
terrible
punishment
for
him
before
everybody
used
to
sing
out
hello
jim
or
mornin
banker
or
some
other
jovial
salutation
now
as
he
went
down
the
street
the
groups
of
men
smoking
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
stores
ignored
him
or
looked
at
him
with
scornful
eyes
nobody
said
hello
jim
not
even
mcphail
or
vance
they
nodded
merely
and
went
on
with
their
smoking
the
children
followed
him
and
stared
at
him
without
compassion
they
had
heard
him
called
a
scoundrel
and
a
thief
too
often
at
home
to
feel
any
pity
for
his
pale
face
after
his
first
trip
down
the
street
bright
with
the
december
sunshine
he
came
home
in
a
bitter
weak
mood
smarting
aching
with
a
poignant
over
the
treatment
he
had
received
from
his
old
cronies
it
all
your
fault
he
burst
out
to
his
wife
if
you
only
let
me
go
away
and
look
up
another
place
i
would
have
to
put
up
with
all
these
sneers
and
insults
what
sneers
and
insults
she
asked
coming
over
to
him
why
nobody
speak
to
me
wo
mcphail
and
mr
mcilvaine
yes
but
not
as
they
used
to
you
ca
blame
jim
you
must
go
to
work
and
win
back
their
confidence
i
ca
do
that
let
go
away
nell
and
try
again
her
mouth
closed
firmly
a
hard
look
came
into
her
eyes
you
can
go
if
you
want
to
jim
i
goin
to
stay
right
here
till
we
can
leave
honorably
we
ca
run
away
from
this
it
would
follow
us
anywhere
we
went
and
it
would
get
worse
the
farther
we
went
he
knew
the
unyielding
quality
of
his
wife
resolution
and
from
that
moment
he
submitted
to
his
fate
he
loved
his
wife
and
children
with
a
passionate
love
that
made
life
with
them
among
the
citizens
he
had
robbed
better
than
life
anywhere
else
on
earth
he
had
no
power
to
leave
them
as
soon
as
possible
he
went
over
his
books
and
found
out
that
he
owed
above
all
notes
coming
in
about
eleven
thousand
dollars
this
was
a
large
sum
to
look
forward
to
paying
by
anything
he
could
do
in
the
siding
now
that
his
credit
was
gone
nobody
would
take
him
as
a
clerk
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
except
manual
labor
and
he
was
not
strong
enough
for
that
his
wife
however
had
a
plan
she
sent
east
to
friends
for
a
little
money
at
once
and
with
a
few
hundred
dollars
opened
a
little
store
in
time
for
the
holiday
trade
notions
light
toys
and
millinery
she
did
her
own
housework
and
attended
to
her
shop
in
a
grim
uncomplaining
fashion
that
made
sanford
feel
like
a
criminal
in
her
presence
he
could
propose
to
help
her
in
the
store
for
he
knew
the
people
would
refuse
to
trade
with
him
so
he
attended
to
the
children
and
did
little
things
about
the
house
for
the
first
few
months
of
the
winter
his
life
for
a
time
was
abjectly
pitiful
he
did
know
what
to
do
he
had
lost
his
footing
and
worst
of
all
he
felt
that
his
wife
no
longer
respected
him
she
loved
and
pitied
him
but
she
no
longer
looked
up
to
him
she
went
about
her
work
and
down
to
her
store
with
a
silent
resolute
uncommunicative
air
utterly
unlike
her
former
sunny
domestic
self
so
that
even
she
seemed
alien
like
the
rest
if
he
had
been
ill
vance
and
mcphail
would
have
attended
him
as
it
was
they
could
not
help
him
she
already
had
the
sympathy
of
the
entire
town
and
mcilvaine
had
said
if
you
need
more
money
you
can
have
it
sanford
call
on
us
at
any
time
thank
you
i
do
think
i
need
it
all
i
ask
is
your
trade
she
replied
i
do
ask
anybody
to
pay
a
thing
worth
either
goin
to
sell
goods
on
business
principles
and
i
expect
folks
to
buy
of
me
because
i
selling
reliable
goods
as
cheap
as
anybody
else
her
business
was
successful
from
the
start
but
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
get
too
confident
this
is
a
kind
of
charity
trade
it
wo
last
on
that
basis
folks
ai
goin
to
buy
of
me
because
i
poor
not
very
long
she
said
to
vance
who
went
in
to
congratulate
her
on
her
booming
trade
during
christmas
and
new
year
vance
called
so
often
advising
or
congratulating
her
that
the
boys
joked
him
say
looky
here
you
goin
to
get
into
a
peck
o
trouble
with
your
wife
yet
you
spend
about
half
time
in
the
new
store
vance
looked
serene
as
he
replied
i
stay
longer
and
go
oftener
if
i
could
well
if
you
ai
cheekier
ol
cheek
i
should
think
you
be
ashamed
to
say
it
of
it
i
proud
of
it
as
i
tell
my
wife
if
i
met
sanford
when
we
was
both
young
they
would
no
such
present
arrangement
the
new
life
made
its
changes
in
sanford
she
grew
thinner
and
graver
but
as
she
went
on
and
trade
steadily
increased
a
feeling
of
pride
a
sort
of
exultation
came
into
her
soul
and
shone
from
her
steady
eyes
it
was
glorious
to
feel
that
she
was
holding
her
own
with
men
in
the
world
winning
their
respect
which
is
better
than
their
flattery
she
arose
each
day
at
five
with
a
distinct
pleasure
for
her
physical
health
was
excellent
never
better
she
began
to
dream
she
could
pay
off
five
hundred
dollars
a
year
of
the
interest
perhaps
she
could
pay
some
of
the
principal
if
all
went
well
perhaps
in
a
year
or
two
she
could
take
a
larger
store
and
if
jim
got
something
to
do
in
ten
years
they
could
pay
it
all
off
every
cent
she
talked
with
business
men
and
read
and
studied
and
felt
each
day
a
firmer
hold
on
affairs
sanford
got
the
agency
of
an
insurance
company
or
two
and
earned
a
few
dollars
during
the
spring
in
june
things
brightened
up
a
little
the
money
for
a
note
of
a
thousand
dollars
fell
due
a
note
he
had
considered
virtually
worthless
but
the
debtor
having
had
a
streak
o
luck
sent
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
sanford
at
once
called
a
meeting
of
his
creditors
and
paid
them
pro
rata
a
thousand
dollars
the
meeting
took
place
in
his
wife
store
and
in
making
the
speech
sanford
said
i
tell
you
gentlemen
if
you
only
give
us
a
chance
we
clear
this
thing
all
up
that
is
the
principal
we
ca
yes
we
can
james
we
can
pay
it
all
principal
and
interest
we
owe
the
interest
just
as
much
as
the
rest
it
was
evident
that
there
was
to
be
no
letting
down
while
she
lived
the
effect
of
this
payment
was
marked
the
general
feeling
was
much
more
kindly
than
before
most
of
the
fellows
dropped
back
into
the
habit
of
calling
him
jim
but
after
all
it
was
not
like
the
greeting
of
old
when
he
was
banker
still
the
gain
in
confidence
found
a
reflex
in
him
his
shoulders
which
had
begun
to
droop
a
little
lifted
and
his
eyes
brightened
we
win
yet
he
began
to
say
she
of
right
to
time
bingham
said
it
was
shortly
after
this
that
he
got
the
agency
for
a
new
system
and
went
on
the
road
with
it
travelling
in
northern
wisconsin
and
minnesota
he
came
back
after
a
three
weeks
trip
quite
jubilant
i
made
a
hundred
dollars
nell
i
all
right
if
this
holds
out
and
i
guess
it
will
in
the
following
november
just
a
year
after
the
failure
they
the
day
at
her
suggestion
by
paying
interest
on
the
unpaid
sums
they
owed
i
could
pay
a
little
more
on
the
principal
she
explained
but
i
guess
it
be
better
to
use
it
for
my
stock
i
can
pay
better
dividends
next
year
take
time
sanford
vance
said
of
course
she
could
not
escape
criticism
there
were
the
usual
number
of
women
who
noticed
that
she
kept
her
young
uns
in
the
latest
style
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
sat
up
nights
to
make
their
little
things
they
also
noticed
that
she
retained
her
house
and
her
furniture
if
i
was
in
her
place
seems
to
me
i
turn
in
some
o
my
fine
furniture
toward
my
debts
sam
gilbert
said
spitefully
she
did
not
even
escape
calumny
sam
gilbert
darkly
hinted
at
certain
goin
on
durin
his
bein
away
lit
up
till
after
midnight
some
nights
i
see
her
winder
from
mine
rose
mcphail
one
of
sanford
most
devoted
friends
asked
quietly
do
you
sit
up
all
night
t
see
i
do
she
snapped
i
ca
sleep
with
such
things
goin
on
if
it
do
you
any
good
jane
i
say
that
she
settin
up
there
sewin
for
the
children
if
you
keep
your
nose
out
o
other
affairs
and
attend
better
to
your
own
your
house
would
look
like
a
an
your
children
like
but
in
spite
of
a
few
annoyances
of
this
character
sanford
found
her
new
life
wholesomer
and
broader
than
her
old
life
and
the
pain
of
her
loss
grew
less
poignant
vi
one
day
in
spring
in
the
lazy
odorous
hush
of
the
afternoon
the
usual
number
of
loafers
were
standing
on
the
platform
waiting
for
the
train
the
sun
was
going
down
the
slope
toward
the
hills
through
a
warm
april
haze
hello
exclaimed
the
man
who
always
sees
things
first
here
comes
sanford
and
the
ducklings
everybody
looked
ai
goin
off
is
she
nope
guess
not
meet
somebody
sanford
well
somethin
up
she
do
often
get
out
o
that
store
le
see
he
been
gone
most
o
the
winter
hai
he
yes
went
away
about
sanford
came
past
leading
a
child
by
each
hand
nodding
and
smiling
to
friends
for
all
seemed
friends
she
looked
very
resolute
and
in
her
plain
dark
dress
with
a
dull
flame
of
color
at
the
throat
while
the
broad
hat
she
wore
gave
her
face
a
touch
of
piquancy
very
charming
evidently
she
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
laughed
and
chatted
in
quite
a
way
she
was
now
an
institution
at
the
siding
her
store
had
grown
in
proportions
yearly
until
it
was
as
large
and
commodious
as
any
in
the
town
the
drummers
for
all
called
there
and
the
fact
that
she
did
not
sell
any
groceries
at
all
did
not
deter
the
drummers
for
grocery
houses
from
calling
to
see
each
time
if
she
had
decided
to
put
in
a
stock
of
groceries
these
young
fellows
had
spread
her
fame
all
up
and
down
the
road
she
had
captured
them
not
by
beauty
but
by
her
pluck
candor
honesty
and
by
a
certain
fearless
but
reserved
camaraderie
she
was
not
afraid
of
them
or
of
anybody
else
now
the
train
whistled
and
everybody
turned
to
watch
it
as
it
came
pushing
around
the
bluff
like
a
huge
hound
on
a
trail
its
nose
close
to
the
ground
among
the
first
to
alight
was
sanford
in
a
shining
new
silk
hat
and
a
new
suit
of
clothes
he
was
smiling
gaily
as
he
fought
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
his
wife
side
hello
he
shouted
i
thought
see
you
all
here
jim
ai
you
cuttin
a
swell
a
swell
well
who
got
a
better
right
a
man
wants
to
look
as
well
as
he
can
when
he
comes
home
to
such
a
family
hello
jim
that
plug
never
do
hello
vance
yes
but
it
got
to
do
say
you
tell
all
the
fellers
that

anything
me
to
come
around
night
to
the
store
i
want
to
make
some
kind
of
a
settlement
all
right
jim
goin
to
pay
a
new
dividend
that
what
i
am
he
beamed
as
he
walked
off
with
his
wife
who
was
studying
him
sharply
jim
what
ails
you
nothin
i
all
right
but
this
new
suit
and
the
hat
and
the
necktie
he
laughed
merrily
so
merrily
in
fact
that
his
wife
looked
at
him
the
more
anxiously
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
queer
state
of
intoxication
a
state
that
made
him
happy
without
impairing
his
faculties
however
he
turned
suddenly
and
put
his
lips
down
toward
her
ear
well
nell
i
ca
hold
in
any
longer
we
struck
it
struck
what
well
you
see
that
derned
fool
partner
o
mine
got
me
to
go
into
a
lot
o
land
in
the
copper
country
that
where
all
the
trouble
came
he
got
awfully
let
down
well
he
had
some
surveyors
to
go
up
there
lately
and
look
it
over
and
the
next
thing
we
knew
the
superior
mining
company
came
along
an
wanted
to
buy
it
of
course
we
did
want
to
sell
just
then
they
had
reached
the
store
door
and
he
paused
we
go
right
home
to
supper
she
said
the
girls
will
look
out
for
things
till
i
get
back
they
walked
on
together
the
children
laughing
and
playing
ahead
well
upshot
of
it
is
i
sold
out
my
share
to
osgood
for
twenty
thousand
dollars
she
stopped
and
stared
at
him
jim
gordon
sanford
fact
i
can
prove
it
he
patted
his
breast
pocket
mysteriously
ten
thousand
right
there
gracious
sakes
alive
how
dare
you
carry
so
much
money
i
mighty
glad
o
the
chance
he
grinned
they
walked
on
almost
in
silence
with
only
a
word
now
and
then
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
and
he
did
want
to
disturb
her
it
was
a
delicious
spring
hour
the
snow
was
all
gone
even
under
the
hedges
the
roads
were
warm
and
brown
the
red
sun
was
flooding
the
valley
with
a
misty
light
and
against
the
orange
and
gold
of
the
sky
the
hills
stood
in
tyrian
purple
wagons
were
rattling
along
the
road
men
on
the
farms
in
the
edge
of
the
village
could
be
heard
whistling
at
their
work
a
discordant
jangle
of
a
neighboring
farmer
announced
that
it
was
time
to
turn
out
sanford
was
almost
as
gay
as
a
lover
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
regaining
his
old
place
in
his
wife
respect
somehow
the
possession
of
the
package
of
money
in
his
pocket
seemed
to
make
him
more
worthy
of
her
to
put
him
more
on
an
equality
with
her
as
they
reached
the
little
square
cottage
he
sat
down
on
the
porch
where
the
red
light
fell
warmly
and
romped
with
the
children
while
his
wife
went
in
and
took
off
her
things
she
kept
a
girl
now
so
that
the
work
of
getting
supper
did
not
devolve
entirely
upon
her
she
came
out
soon
to
call
them
all
to
the
in
the
little
kitchen
back
of
the
the
children
were
wild
with
delight
to
have
poppa
back
and
the
meal
was
the
merriest
they
had
had
for
a
long
time
the
doors
and
windows
were
open
and
the
spring
evening
air
came
in
laden
with
the
sweet
suggestive
smell
of
bare
ground
the
alert
chuckle
of
an
occasional
robin
could
be
heard
sanford
looked
up
from
her
tea
there
one
thing
i
do
like
jim
and
that
the
way
that
money
comes
you
did
you
did
really
earn
it
oh
do
worry
yourself
about
that
that
the
way
things
go
it
just
luck
well
i
ca
see
it
just
that
way
it
seems
to
me
just
like
gambling
you
win
but
but
somebody
else
must
lose
oh
well
look
if
you
go
to
lookin
too
sharp
into
things
like
that
you
find
a
good
of
any
business
like
gamblin
she
said
no
more
but
her
face
remained
clouded
on
the
way
down
to
the
store
they
met
lincoln
come
down
to
the
store
link
and
bring
joe
i
want
to
talk
with
yeh
lincoln
stared
but
said
all
right
then
added
as
the
others
walked
away
well
that
feller
ai
got
no
cheek
t
talk
to
me
like
that
more
cheek
a
mule
jim
took
a
seat
near
the
door
and
watched
his
wife
as
she
went
about
the
store
she
employed
two
clerks
now
while
she
attended
to
the
books
and
the
cash
he
thought
how
different
she
was
and
he
liked
and
in
a
way
feared
her
cool
manner
her
and
her
smileless
conversation
with
a
drummer
who
came
in
jim
was
puzzled
he
did
quite
understand
the
peculiar
effect
his
wife
manner
had
upon
him
outside
word
had
passed
around
that
jim
had
got
back
and
that
something
was
in
the
wind
and
the
fellows
began
to
drop
in
when
mcphail
came
in
and
said
hello
in
his
hearty
way
sanford
went
over
to
his
wife
and
said
say
nell
i
ca

this
i
goin
to
get
rid
o
this
money
right
off
now
very
well
just
as
you
please
gents
he
began
turning
his
back
to
the
counter
and
smiling
blandly
on
them
one
thumb
in
his
vest
pocket
any
o
you
fellers

anything
against
the
lumber
county
bank
any
certificates
of
deposit
or
notes

or
three
nodded
and
mcphail
said
humorously
slapping
his
pocket
i
always
go
loaded
produce
your
paper
gents
continued
sanford
with
a
dramatic
whang
of
a
leathern
wallet
down
into
his
palm
i
buying
up
all
paper
on
the
bank
it
was
a
superb
stroke
the
fellows
whistled
and
stared
and
swore
at
one
another
this
was
coming
down
on
them
link
was
dumb
with
amazement
as
he
received
sixteen
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
crisp
new
bills
andrew
it
your
turn
next
sanford
tone
was
actually
patronizing
as
he
faced
mcphail
i
was
jokin

my
certificate

do
matter
do
matter
here

hundred
dollars

jest
where
this
windfall
comes
from
said
vance
as
he
took
his
share
comes
from
the
copper
country
was
all
he
ever
said
about
it
i
do
see
where
he
invested
link
said
was
a
scratch
of
a
pen
to
show
that
he
invested
anything
while
he
was
in
the
bank
guess
where
our
money
went
well
i
ai
squealin
said
vance
i
glad
to
get
out
of
it
without
asking
any
questions
i
tell
yeh
one
thing
though
he
added
as
they
stood
outside
the
door
we
never
smelt
of
our
money
again
if
it
had
been
that
woman
in
there
she
paid
it
alone
if
jim
had
made
this
strike
whereas
he
never
well
all
right
we
out
of
it
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
moments
of
sanford
life
he
expanded
in
it
he
was
as
pleasantly
aware
of
the
glances
of
his
wife
as
he
used
to
be
when
as
a
clerk
he
saw
her
pass
and
look
in
at
the
window
where
he
sat
dreaming
over
his
ledger
as
for
her
she
was
going
over
the
whole
situation
from
this
new
standpoint
he
had
been
weak
he
had
fallen
in
her
estimation
and
yet
as
he
stood
there
so
boyish
in
his
exultation
the
father
of
her
children
she
loved
him
with
a
touch
of
maternal
tenderness
and
hope
and
her
heart
throbbed
in
an
unconscious
swift
determination
to
do
him
good
she
no
longer
deceived
herself
she
was
his
equal
in
some
ways
his
superior
her
love
had
friendship
in
it
but
less
of
sex
and
no
adoration
as
she
blew
out
the
lights
stepped
out
on
the
walk
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
he
said
well
nellie
you
wo

to
do
that
any
more

mother
to

children
jim
looked
up
at
the
moon
filling
the
warm
moist
air
with
a
transfiguring
light
that
fell
in
a
luminous
mist
on
the
distant
hills
i
know
one
thing
nellie
i

better
man
than
i
was
before
and
it
all
owin
to
you
his
voice
trembled
a
little
and
the
sympathetic
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
did
speak
at
once
she
could
at
last
she
stopped
him
by
a
touch
on
the
arm
jim
i
want
a
partner
in
my
store

again
right
here

much
of

she
held
out
her
hand
as
one
man
to
another
he
took
it
wonderingly
all
right
nell
i
do
it
then
as
he
put
his
arm
around
her
she
held
up
her
lips
to
be
kissed
and
we
be
happy
again
happy
as
we
deserve
i
she
said
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
it
almost
like
getting
married
again
nell
for
me
as
they
walked
off
up
the
sidewalk
in
the
soft
moonlight
their
arms
were
interlocked
they
loitered
like
a
couple
of

for

of

short

with
several
parts
the
physical
book
used
a
convention
of
not
printing
for
the
first
part
of
the
story
we
put
those
in
to
give
better
structure
to
the
document
the
quotes
at
the
beginning
of
each
chapter
were
not
closed
with
a
period
in
the
physical
book
we
put
them
in

give
better
results
with
the
tools
that
we
use
to
check
that
we
produce
foreward
on
page
xiv
was
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
there
were
three
other
occurrences
of
farmhouse
or
farmhouses
without
the
hyphen
and
no
occurrences
with
the
hyphen
we
transcribed
the
word
without
the
hyphen
a
branch
road
on
page
is
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
there
are
three
other
occurrences
of
grapevine
without
the
hyphen
and
none
with
we
transcribed
the
word
without
the
hyphen
under
the
coolly
several
times
in
this
short
story
howard
was
abbreviated
as
how
with
the
period
this
convention
was
retained
on
page
add
to
after
them
in
the
sentence
he
simply
pushed
them
one
side
and
went
on
with
his
reading
on

is
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
in
the
same
short
story
is
hyphenated
on
page
in
the
middle
of
the
line
however
barnyard
is
spelled
without
the
hyphen
on
page
also
in
the
same
short
story
barnyard
is
spelled
without
a
hyphen
on
page
and
on
page
we
went
with
the
majority
and
spelled
barnyard
without
a
hyphen
here
which
makes
the
item
on
page
the
sole
outlier
on
page
is
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
there
are
no
other
occurrences
of
the
word
in
this
book
we
transcribed
with
the
hyphen
mainly
because
is
spelled
with
a
hyphen
on
the
same
page
on
page
is
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
also
occurs
on
page
and
with
the
hyphen
so
it
was
retained
here
as
well
return
of
a
private
on
page
we
added
a
missing
quote
before
but
in
the
paragraph
they
called
that
coffee
jayvy
grumbled
one
of
them
but
it
never
went
by
the
road
where
government
jayvy
resides
i
reckon
i
know
coffee
from
peas
on
page
remove
me
from
gim
me
me
a
kiss
under
the
lion
paw
on
page
was
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
there
is
no
other
usage
of
somebuddy
but
anybuddy
and
nobuddy
can
be
found
in
the
same
short
story
therefore
we
transcribed
somebuddy
without
the
hyphen
on
page
we
added
a
closing
quote
following
the
period
after
rest
but
i
do
take
it
said
butler
coolly
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
go
on
jest
as
you
been
or
give
me
a
thousand
dollars
down
and
a
mortgage
at
ten
per
cent
on
the
rest
ripley
trip
on
page
flustrated
is
some
cross
between
flustered
and
frustrated
and
given
it
is
used
in
dialect
perhaps
this
is
some
midwest
variation
of
one
of
the
two
words
therefore
we
left
the
following
sentence
as
is
i
guess
she
kind
a
sort
a
forgot
it
bein
so
flustrated
y
know
uncle
ethan
ripley
on
page
is
hyphenated
and
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
we
transcribed
the
word
without
the
hyphen
nobuddy
buy
that
stuff
but
an
old
numskull
like
you
god
raven
the
convention
in
this
story
and
in
the
next
one
was
to
spell
it
with
a
space
but
in
the
earlier
short
stories
the
contraction
was
spelled
it
we
retained
this
inconsistency
on
page
there
is
a
quote
the
book
uses
a
for
the
first
quote
a
single
quote
for
the
second
and
a
double
quote
for
the
third
quote
this
will
cause
a
problem
with
our
mechanism
we
have
also
used
a
single
quote
for
the
third
quote
i
tired
of
the
scramble
he
kept
breaking
out
of
silence
to
say
i
do
blame
the
boys
but
it
plain
to
me
they
see
that
my
going
will
let
them
move
up
one
mason
cynically
voiced
the
whole
thing
today
can
say
to
see
you
go
bloom
because
your
going
does
concern
me
i
not
in
line
of
succession
but
some
of
the
other
boys
do
feel
so
there
no
divinity
doth
hedge
an
editor
nothing
but
law
prevents
the
murder
of
those
above
by
those
below
