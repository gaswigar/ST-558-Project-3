agnes
schwarzschild
a
note
on
rosa
luxemburg
rosa
luxemburg
was
born
on
march
at
zamosc
a
little
town
of
russian
poland
not
far
from
the
city
of
lublin
she
came
from
a
fairly
family
of
jewish
merchants
and
soon
showed
the
two
outstanding
traits
which
were
to
characterise
all
her
life
and
work
a
high
degree
of
intelligence
and
a
burning
thirst
for
social
justice
which
led
her
while
still
a
schoolgirl
into
the
revolutionary
camp
partly
to
escape
the
russian
police
partly
to
complete
her
education
she
went
to
zurich
and
studied
there
the
sciences
of
law
and
economics
her
doctoral
dissertation
dealt
with
the
industrial
development
of
poland
and
showed
up
the
vital
integration
of
polish
industry
with
the
wider
economic
system
of
metropolitan
russia
it
was
a
work
not
only
of
considerable
promise
but
already
of
solid
and
substantial
achievement
her
doctorate
won
rosa
luxemburg
looked
around
for
a
promising
field
of
work
and
decided
to
go
to
germany
whose
movement
seemed
destined
to
play
a
leading
part
in
the
future
history
of
international
socialism
she
settled
there
in
and
two
years
later
contracted
a
formal
marriage
with
a
german
subject
which
secured
her
against
the
danger
of
forcible
deportation
to
russia
now
at
that
moment
the
german
party
was
in
the
throes
of
a
serious
crisis
in
eduard
bernstein
published
his
work
voraussetzungen
des
sozialismus
und
die
aufgaben
der
which
urged
the
party
to
drop
its
revolutionary
jargon
and
to
work
henceforth
for
tangible
social
reforms
within
the
given
economic
instead
of
trying
to
bring
about
its
final
and
forcible
overthrow
this
or
seemed
to
rosa
luxemburg
a
base
as
well
as
a
foolish
doctrine
and
she
published
in
the
same
year
a
pamphlet
oder
revolution
which
dealt
with
bernstein
ideas
in
no
uncertain
fashion
from
this
moment
onward
she
was
and
remained
one
of
the
acknowledged
leaders
of
the
left
wing
within
the
german
movement
the
events
of
the
year
gave
rosa
luxemburg
a
welcome
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
revolution
was
to
her
more
than
a
subject
of
purely
academic
interest
as
soon
as
the
russian
masses
began
to
move
she
hurried
to
warsaw
and
threw
herself
into
the
fray
there
followed
a
short
span
of
feverish
activity
half
a
year
imprisonment
and
finally
a
return
journey
to
berlin
the
experiences
of
the
warsaw
rising
are
reflected
in
a
book
entitled
partei
und
which
was
published
in
it
recommends
the
general
strike
as
the
most
effective
weapon
in
the
struggle
of
the
proletariat
against
the
bourgeoisie
the
international
socialist
congress
which
met
at
stuttgart
in
prepared
and
foreshadowed
the
sorry
history
of
rosa
luxemburg
later
life
on
that
occasion
she
drafted
together
with
lenin
a
resolution
which
demanded
that
the
workers
of
the
world
should
make
any
future
war
an
opportunity
for
the
destruction
of
the
capitalist
system
unlike
so
many
others
she
stuck
to
her
resolution
when
seven
years
later
the
time
of
testing
came
the
result
was
that
she
had
to
spend
nearly
the
whole
of
the
first
world
war
in
jail
either
under
punishment
or
in
protective
custody
but
imprisonment
did
not
mean
inactivity
in
there
appeared
in
switzerland
her
book
krise
der
which
assailed
the
leaders
of
the
german
labour
party
for
their
patriotic
attitude
and
called
the
masses
to
revolutionary
action
the
foundation
of
the
spartacus
league
in
the
germ
cell
out
of
which
the
communist
party
of
germany
was
soon
to
develop
was
vitally
connected
with
the
dissemination
of
rosa
luxemburg
aggressive
sentiments
the
collapse
of
the
on
november
gave
rosa
luxemburg
her
freedom
and
an
range
of
opportunities
the
two
months
that
followed
must
have
been
more
crowded
and
more
colourful
than
all
her
previous
life
taken
together
but
the
end
of
her
career
was
imminent
the
fatal
spartacus
week
an
abortive
rising
of
the
berlin
workers
led
on
january
to
her
arrest
by
a
government
composed
of
former
party
comrades
during
her
removal
to
prison
she
was
attacked
and
severely
beaten
by
soldiers
belonging
to
the
extreme
right
a
treatment
which
she
did
not
survive
her
body
was
recovered
days
later
from
a
canal
a
type
not
unlike
trotsky
rosa
luxemburg
had
her
tender
and
sentimental
side
which
comes
to
the
surface
in
her
correspondence
especially
in
the
aus
dem
printed
in
as
a
thinker
she
showed
considerable
honesty
and
independence
of
mind
accumulation
of
first
published
in
which
is
undoubtedly
her
finest
achievement
reveals
her
as
that
rarest
of
all
rare
phenomena
a
marxist
critical
of
karl
marx
stark
introduction
academic
economists
have
recently
returned
from
the
elaboration
of
static
equilibrium
to
the
classical
search
for
a
dynamic
model
of
a
developing
economy
rosa
luxemburg
neglected
by
marxist
and
academic
economists
alike
offers
a
theory
of
the
dynamic
development
of
capitalism
which
is
of
the
greatest
interest
the
book
is
one
of
considerable
difficulty
apart
from
the
vivid
historical
chapters
and
to
those
accustomed
only
to
academic
analysis
the
difficulty
is
rendered
insurmountable
by
the
marxist
terminology
in
which
it
is
expressed
the
purpose
of
this
preface
is
to
provide
a
glossary
of
terms
and
to
search
for
the
main
thread
of
the
argument
leaving
the
historical
illustrations
to
speak
for
themselves
and
set
it
out
in
simpler
language
the
result
is
no
doubt
too
simple
the
reader
must
sample
for
himself
the
rich
confusion
in
which
the
central
core
of
analysis
is
imbedded
and
must
judge
for
himself
whether
the
core
has
been
mishandled
in
the
process
of
digging
it
out
our
author
takes
her
departure
from
the
numerical
examples
for
simple
reproduction
production
with
a
constant
stock
of
capital
and
expanded
reproduction
production
with
capital
accumulating
set
out
in
volume
ii
of
marx
as
she
points
out
marx
completed
the
model
for
simple
reproduction
but
the
models
for
accumulation
were
left
at
his
death
in
a
chaos
of
notes
and
they
are
not
really
fit
to
bear
all
the
weight
she
puts
on
them
heaven
help
us
if
posterity
is
to
pore
over
all
the
backs
of
old
envelopes
on
which
economists
have
jotted
down
numerical
examples
in
working
out
a
piece
of
analysis
to
follow
her
line
of
thought
however
it
is
necessary
to
examine
her
version
of
marx
models
closely
to
see
on
what
assumptions
they
are
based
explicitly
or
unconsciously
and
to
search
the
assumptions
for
clues
to
the
succeeding
analysis
to
begin
at
the
beginning
gross
national
income
for
a
closed
economy
for
say
a
year
is
written
v
that
is
constant
capital
variable
capital
and
surplus
variable
capital
is
the
annual
wages
bill
surplus
is
annual
rent
interest
and
net
profit
so
that
represents
net
national
income
in
this
introduction
surplus
is
used
interchangeably
with
rent
interest
and
net
profit
constant
capital
represents
at
the
same
time
the
contribution
which
materials
and
capital
equipment
make
to
annual
output
and
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
stock
of
physical
capital
in
existence
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
when
all
commodities
are
selling
at
normal
prices
these
two
quantities
are
equal
normal
prices
are
tacitly
assumed
always
to
rule
an
assumption
which
is
useful
for
problems
though
treacherous
when
we
have
to
deal
with
slumps
and
crises
gross
receipts
equal
to
v
pass
through
the
hands
of
the
capitalists
during
the
year
of
which
they
use
an
amount
to
replace
physical
capital
used
up
during
the
year
so
that
represents
costs
of
raw
materials
and
wear
and
tear
and
amortisation
of
plant
an
amount
is
paid
to
workers
and
is
consumed
by
them
saving
by
workers
is
regarded
as
negligible
the
surplus
remains
to
the
capitalists
for
their
own
consumption
and
for
net
saving
the
professional
classes
civil
servants
priests
prostitutes
etc
are
treated
as
of
the
capitalists
and
their
incomes
do
not
appear
as
they
are
not
regarded
as
producing
expenditure
upon
them
tends
to
lessen
the
saving
of
capitalists
and
their
own
expenditure
and
saving
are
treated
as
expenditure
and
saving
out
of
surplus
in
the
model
set
out
in
chapter
vi
there
is
no
technical
progress
this
is
a
drastic
simplification
made
deliberately
and
the
ratio
of
capital
to
labour
is
constant
as
the
stock
of
capital
increases
employment
increases
in
proportion
thus
real
output
per
worker
employed
is
constant
hours
of
work
per
year
do
not
vary
and
real
wages
per
man
are
constant
it
follows
that
real
surplus
per
man
is
also
constant
so
long
as
these
assumptions
are
retained
marxian
presents
no
problem
is
the
product
of
created
per
is
constant
because
hours
of
work
are
constant
real
product
per
man
year
being
constant
on
the
above
assumptions
the
of
a
unit
of
product
is
constant
for
convenience
we
may
assume
money
wages
per
man
constant
then
on
these
assumptions
both
the
money
price
of
a
unit
of
output
and
the
of
a
unit
of
money
are
constant
this
of
course
merely
plasters
over
all
the
problems
of
measurement
connected
with
the
use
of
index
numbers
but
provided
that
the
technique
of
production
is
unchanging
and
normal
prices
are
ruling
those
problems
are
not
serious
and
we
can
conduct
the
analysis
in
terms
of
money
values
rosa
luxemburg
regards
it
as
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
we
calculate
in
money
or
in
the
assumption
of
constant
real
wages
presents
a
difficulty
which
we
may
notice
in
passing
the
operation
of
the
capitalist
system
is
presumed
to
depress
the
level
of
wages
down
to
the
limit
set
by
the
minimum
subsistence
of
the
worker
and
his
family
but
how
large
a
family
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
fluke
if
the
average
size
of
family
supported
by
the
given
wage
of
a
worker
were
such
as
to
provide
for
a
rate
of
growth
of
population
exactly
adjusted
to
the
rate
of
accumulation
of
capital
and
she
certainly
does
not
hold
that
this
is
the
case
there
is
a
reserve
army
of
labour
standing
by
ready
to
take
employment
when
the
capitalists
offer
it
while
they
are
unemployed
the
workers
have
no
source
of
income
but
are
kept
alive
by
sharing
in
the
consumption
of
the
wages
of
friends
and
relations
who
are
in
work
when
an
increase
in
the
stock
of
capital
takes
place
more
workers
begin
to
earn
wages
those
formerly
employed
are
relieved
of
the
burden
of
supporting
some
unemployed
relations
and
their
own
consumption
rises
thus
either
they
were
living
below
the
subsistence
minimum
before
or
they
are
above
it
now
we
may
cut
this
knot
by
simply
postulating
that
real
wages
per
man
are
constant
without
asking
why
the
important
point
for
the
analysis
which
we
are
examining
is
that
when
employment
increases
the
total
consumption
of
the
workers
as
a
whole
increases
by
the
amount
of
the
wages
received
by
the
additional
workers
we
may
now
set
out
the
model
for
simple
reproduction
that
is
annual
national
income
for
an
economy
in
which
the
stock
of
capital
is
kept
intact
but
not
increased
all
output
is
divided
into
two
departments
i
producing
capital
equipment
and
raw
materials
producers
goods
and
ii
producing
consumption
goods
then
we
have
i
ii
thus
this
means
that
the
net
output
of
the
producers
goods
department
is
equal
to
the
replacement
of
capital
in
the
consumers
goods
department
the
whole
surplus
as
well
as
the
whole
of
wages
is
currently
consumed
before
proceeding
to
the
model
for
accumulation
there
is
a
difficulty
which
must
be
discussed
in
the
above
model
the
stock
of
capital
exists
so
to
speak
off
stage
rosa
luxemburg
is
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
relationship
between
annual
wear
and
tear
of
capital
which
is
part
of
and
the
stock
of
fixed
capital
but
as
soon
as
she
following
marx
discusses
accumulation
she
equates
the
addition
to
the
stock
of
capital
made
by
saving
out
of
surplus
in
one
year
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
capital
in
the
next
year
to
make
sense
of
this
we
must
assume
that
all
capital
is
consumed
and
made
good
once
a
year
she
seems
to
slip
into
this
assumption
inadvertently
at
first
though
later
it
is
made
explicit
she
also
consciously
postulates
that
represents
the
amount
of
capital
which
is
paid
out
in
wages
in
advance
of
receipts
from
sales
of
the
commodities
produced
this
as
she
says
is
the
natural
assumption
to
make
for
agricultural
production
where
workers
this
year
are
paid
from
the
proceeds
of
last
year
harvest
thus
represents
at
the
same
time
the
annual
wages
bill
and
the
amount
of
capital
locked
up
in
the
wages
fund
while
represents
both
the
annual
amortisation
of
capital
and
the
total
stock
of
capital
other
than
the
wages
fund
this
is
a
simplification
which
is
tiresome
rather
than
helpful
it
arises
from
marx
habit
of
writing
c
v
for
the
rate
of
profit
on
capital
but
it
is
no
more
than
a
simplification
and
does
not
invalidate
the
rest
of
the
analysis
another
awkward
assumption
which
causes
serious
trouble
later
is
implicit
in
the
argument
savings
out
of
the
surplus
accruing
in
each
department
producers
and
consumers
goods
are
always
invested
in
capital
in
the
same
department
there
is
no
reason
to
imagine
that
one
capitalist
is
linked
to
others
in
his
own
department
more
than
to
those
in
the
other
department
so
the
conception
seems
to
be
that
each
capitalist
invests
his
savings
in
his
own
business
there
is
no
lending
by
one
capitalist
to
another
and
no
capitalist
ever
shifts
his
sphere
of
operations
from
one
department
to
another
this
is
a
severe
assumption
to
make
even
about
the
era
before
limited
liability
was
introduced
and
becomes
absurd
afterwards
moreover
it
is
incompatible
with
the
postulate
that
the
rate
of
profit
on
capital
tends
to
equality
throughout
the
economy
for
the
mechanism
which
equalises
profits
is
the
flow
of
new
investment
and
the
transfer
of
capital
as
amortisation
funds
are
into
more
profitable
lines
of
production
and
away
from
less
profitable
lines
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
lending
by
one
capitalist
to
another
puts
limitation
upon
the
model
not
only
must
the
total
rate
of
investment
be
equal
to
the
total
of
planned
saving
but
investment
in
each
department
must
be
equal
to
saving
in
that
department
and
not
only
must
the
rate
of
increase
of
capital
lead
to
an
increase
of
total
output
compatible
with
total
demand
but
the
increase
in
output
of
each
department
dictated
by
the
increase
in
capital
in
that
department
must
be
divided
between
consumers
and
producers
goods
in
proportions
compatible
with
the
demand
for
each
dictated
by
the
consumption
and
the
investment
plans
in
each
department
there
is
no
difficulty
however
in
choosing
numbers
which
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
model
the
numerical
examples
derived
from
jottings
are
cumbersome
and
confusing
but
a
clear
and
simple
model
can
be
constructed
on
the
basis
of
the
assumptions
set
out
in
chapter
vii
in
each
department
constant
capital
is
four
times
variable
capital
constant
capital
is
the
stock
of
raw
materials
which
is
turned
over
once
a
year
variable
capital
is
the
wages
bill
which
is
equal
to
the
capital
represented
by
the
wages
fund
surplus
is
equal
to
variable
capital
net
income
is
divided
equally
between
wages
and
surplus
and
half
of
surplus
is
saved
savings
are
allotted
between
constant
and
variable
capital
in
such
a
way
as
to
preserve
the
to
ratio
thus
of
savings
represents
a
demand
for
producers
goods
and
is
added
to
constant
capital
each
year
and
represents
a
demand
for
consumers
goods
and
is
added
to
the
wages
fund
variable
capital
these
ratios
dictate
the
relationship
between
department
i
goods
and
department
ii
consumers
goods
it
can
easily
be
seen
that
the
basic
assumptions
require
that
the
output
of
department
i
must
stand
in
the
ratio
of
to
to
the
output
of
department
ii
we
can
now
construct
a
much
simpler
model
than
those
provided
in
the
text
department
i
department
ii
total
in
department
i
units
are
saved
half
of
of
which
are
invested
in
constant
capital
and
in
variable
capital
in
department
ii
units
are
saved
being
added
to
constant
and
to
variable
capital
the
units
of
producers
goods
provide
constant
capital
for
department
i
and
constant
capital
for
department
ii
and
the
units
of
consumers
goods
provide
wages
of
labour
already
employed
for
consumption
out
of
surplus
and
addition
to
variable
capital
which
provide
for
an
addition
to
employment
after
the
investment
has
been
made
and
the
labour
force
increased
in
proportion
to
the
wages
bill
we
have
department
i
department
ii
total
the
two
departments
are
now
equipped
to
carry
out
another
round
of
investment
at
the
prescribed
rate
and
the
process
of
accumulation
continues
the
ratios
happen
to
have
been
chosen
so
that
the
total
labour
force
and
total
gross
output
increase
by
per
cent
per
annum
but
all
this
as
rosa
luxemburg
remarks
is
just
arithmetic
the
only
point
of
substance
which
she
deduces
from
marx
numerical
examples
is
that
it
is
always
department
i
which
takes
the
initiative
she
maintains
that
the
capitalists
in
department
i
decide
how
much
producers
goods
to
produce
and
that
department
ii
has
to
arrange
its
affairs
so
as
to
absorb
an
amount
of
producers
goods
which
will
fit
in
with
their
plans
on
the
face
of
it
this
is
obviously
absurd
the
arithmetic
is
perfectly
neutral
between
the
two
departments
and
as
she
herself
shows
will
serve
equally
well
for
the
imagined
case
of
a
socialist
society
where
investment
is
planned
with
a
view
to
consumption
but
behind
all
this
rigmarole
lies
the
real
problem
which
she
is
trying
to
formulate
where
does
the
demand
come
from
which
keeps
accumulation
going
she
is
not
concerned
with
the
problem
nowadays
so
familiar
of
the
balance
between
saving
and
investment
marx
himself
was
aware
of
that
problem
as
is
seen
in
his
analysis
of
disequilibrium
under
conditions
of
simple
reproduction
zero
net
investment
when
new
fixed
capital
comes
into
existence
part
of
gross
receipts
are
set
aside
in
amortisation
funds
without
any
actual
outlay
being
made
on
renewals
then
total
demand
falls
short
of
equilibrium
output
and
the
system
runs
into
a
slump
contrariwise
when
a
burst
of
renewals
falls
due
in
excess
of
the
current
rate
of
amortisation
a
boom
sets
in
for
equilibrium
it
is
necessary
for
the
age
composition
of
the
stock
of
capital
to
be
such
that
current
renewals
just
absorb
current
amortisation
funds
similarly
when
accumulation
is
taking
place
current
investment
must
absorb
current
net
saving
it
is
in
connection
with
the
problem
of
effective
demand
in
this
sense
that
marx
brings
into
the
analysis
when
real
output
expands
at
constant
money
prices
the
increasing
total
of
money
value
of
output
requires
an
increase
in
the
stock
of
money
in
circulation
unless
the
velocity
of
circulation
rises
appropriately
the
capitalists
therefore
have
to
devote
part
of
their
savings
to
increasing
their
holdings
of
cash
for
there
is
no
borrowing
this
causes
a
deficiency
of
effective
demand
but
the
increase
in
the
quantity
of
money
in
circulation
comes
from
newly
mined
gold
and
the
expenditure
of
the
gold
mining
industry
upon
the
other
departments
just
makes
up
the
deficiency
in
demand
rosa
luxemburg
garbles
this
argument
considerably
and
brushes
it
away
as
beside
the
point
and
it
beside
the
point
that
she
is
concerned
with
she
does
not
admit
the
savings
and
investment
problem
for
she
takes
it
for
granted
that
each
individual
act
of
saving
out
of
surplus
is
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
amount
of
real
investment
and
that
every
piece
of
investment
is
financed
by
saving
out
of
surplus
of
the
same
capitalist
who
makes
it
what
she
appears
to
be
concerned
with
is
rather
the
inducement
to
invest
what
motive
have
the
capitalists
for
enlarging
their
stock
of
real
capital
how
do
they
know
that
there
will
be
demand
for
the
increased
output
of
goods
which
the
new
capital
will
produce
so
that
they
can
their
surplus
in
a
profitable
form
on
the
purely
analytical
plane
her
affinity
seems
to
be
with
hobson
rather
than
keynes
needless
to
say
our
author
does
not
formulate
the
problem
of
the
inducement
to
invest
in
modern
terminology
and
the
ambiguities
and
contradictions
in
her
exposition
have
left
ample
scope
for
her
critics
to
represent
her
theory
as
irredeemable
nonsense
but
the
most
natural
way
to
read
it
is
also
the
clearest
investment
can
take
place
in
an
stock
of
capital
only
if
the
capitalists
are
assured
of
an
market
for
the
goods
which
the
capital
will
produce
on
this
reading
the
statement
of
the
problem
leads
straightforwardly
to
the
solution
propounded
in
the
third
section
of
this
book
marx
has
his
own
answer
to
the
problem
of
inducement
to
invest
which
she
refers
to
in
the
first
chapter
the
pressure
of
competition
forces
each
individual
capitalist
to
increase
his
capital
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
economies
of
production
for
if
he
does
not
his
rivals
will
and
he
will
be
undersold
rosa
luxemburg
does
not
discuss
whether
this
mechanism
provides
an
adequate
drive
to
keep
accumulation
going
but
looks
for
some
prospective
demand
outside
the
circle
of
production
here
the
numerical
examples
as
she
shows
fail
to
help
and
this
is
in
the
nature
of
the
case
for
in
modern
jargon
the
examples
deal
with
quantities
while
she
is
looking
for
prospects
of
increased
demand
for
commodities
if
accumulation
does
take
place
demand
will
absorb
output
as
the
model
shows
but
what
is
it
that
makes
accumulation
take
place
in
section
ii
our
author
sets
out
to
find
what
answers
have
been
given
to
her
problem
the
analysis
she
has
in
mind
is
now
broader
than
the
strict
confines
of
the
arithmetical
model
technical
progress
is
going
on
and
the
output
of
an
hour
labour
rises
as
time
goes
by
the
concept
of
now
becomes
treacherous
for
the
of
commodities
is
continuously
falling
real
wages
tend
to
be
constant
in
terms
of
commodities
thus
the
of
labour
power
is
falling
and
the
share
of
surplus
in
net
income
is
rising
the
rate
of
exploitation
is
rising
the
amount
of
saving
in
real
terms
is
therefore
rising
she
suggests
later
that
the
proportion
of
surplus
saved
rises
with
surplus
in
which
case
real
savings
increase
all
the
more
the
problem
is
thus
more
formidable
than
appears
in
the
model
for
the
equilibrium
rate
of
accumulation
of
capital
in
real
terms
is
greater
than
in
the
model
where
the
rate
of
exploitation
is
constant
at
the
same
time
the
proportion
of
constant
to
variable
capital
is
rising
she
regards
this
not
as
something
which
is
likely
to
happen
for
technical
reasons
but
as
being
necessarily
bound
up
with
the
very
nature
of
technical
progress
as
productivity
increases
the
amount
of
producers
goods
handled
per
of
labour
increases
therefore
she
says
the
proportion
of
to
must
increase
this
is
an
error
it
arises
from
thinking
of
constant
capital
in
terms
of
goods
and
contrasting
it
with
variable
capital
in
terms
of
that
is
hours
of
labour
she
forgets
marx
warning
that
as
progress
takes
place
the
of
the
commodities
making
up
constant
capital
also
falls
it
is
perfectly
possible
for
productivity
to
increase
without
any
increase
in
the
of
capital
per
man
employed
this
would
occur
if
improvements
in
the
productivity
of
labour
in
making
goods
kept
pace
with
the
productivity
of
labour
in
using
goods
to
make
consumers
goods
inventions
balance
inventions
so
that
technical
progress
is
however
we
can
easily
get
out
of
this
difficulty
by
postulating
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
technical
progress
is
mainly
or
a
better
term
so
that
capital
per
man
employed
is
rising
through
time
rosa
luxemburg
treats
the
authors
whom
she
examines
in
section
ii
with
a
good
deal
of
sarcasm
and
dismisses
them
all
as
useless
to
some
of
the
points
raised
her
answers
seem
scarcely
adequate
for
instance
rodbertus
sees
the
source
of
all
the
troubles
of
capitalism
in
the
falling
proportion
of
wages
in
national
income
he
can
be
interpreted
to
refer
to
the
proportion
of
wages
in
gross
income
in
that
case
she
is
right
on
the
assumption
of
inventions
in
arguing
that
a
fall
in
the
proportion
of
wages
is
bound
up
with
technical
progress
and
that
the
proportion
could
be
held
constant
only
by
stopping
progress
he
can
also
be
taken
to
refer
to
the
share
of
wages
in
net
output
and
this
is
the
more
natural
reading
on
this
reading
she
argues
that
the
fall
in
share
of
wages
or
rise
in
rate
of
exploitation
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
fall
in
the
rate
of
profit
on
capital
as
capital
per
man
employed
rises
profit
per
man
employed
must
rise
if
profit
per
unit
of
capital
is
constant
but
she
does
not
follow
up
the
argument
and
inquire
what
rise
in
the
rate
of
exploitation
is
necessary
to
keep
capitalism
going
actually
the
statisticians
tell
us
the
share
of
wages
in
net
income
has
been
fairly
constant
in
modern
industrial
economies
it
is
obvious
that
the
less
the
rate
of
exploitation
rises
the
smaller
is
the
rise
in
the
rate
of
saving
which
the
system
has
to
digest
while
the
rise
in
real
consumption
by
workers
which
takes
place
when
the
rate
of
exploitation
rises
more
slowly
than
productivity
in
the
consumption
good
industries
creates
an
outlet
for
investment
in
productive
capacity
in
those
industries
the
horrors
of
capitalism
and
the
difficulties
which
it
creates
for
itself
are
both
exaggerated
by
the
assumption
of
constant
rates
and
although
it
would
be
impossible
to
defend
rodbertus
position
that
a
constant
rate
of
exploitation
is
all
that
is
needed
to
put
everything
right
he
certainly
makes
a
contribution
to
the
argument
which
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
also
seems
to
be
treated
too
lightly
his
conception
is
that
the
rising
proportion
of
constant
capital
in
both
departments
machines
to
make
machines
as
well
as
machines
to
make
consumers
goods
provides
an
outlet
for
accumulation
and
that
competition
is
the
driving
force
which
keeps
capitalists
accumulating
rosa
luxemburg
is
no
doubt
correct
in
saying
that
his
argument
does
not
carry
the
analysis
beyond
the
stage
at
which
marx
left
it
but
he
certainly
elaborates
a
point
which
she
seems
perversely
to
overlook
her
real
objection
to
is
that
he
shows
how
in
certain
conditions
capitalist
accumulation
might
be
while
she
wishes
to
establish
that
the
coming
disintegration
of
the
capitalist
system
is
not
merely
probable
on
the
evidence
but
is
a
logical
necessity
the
authors
such
as
sismondi
malthus
and
vorontsov
who
are
groping
after
the
problem
of
equilibrium
between
saving
and
investment
are
treated
with
even
less
sympathy
though
she
has
a
kindly
feeling
for
sismondi
to
whom
she
considers
that
marx
gave
too
little
recognition
for
she
is
either
oblivious
that
there
is
such
a
problem
or
regards
it
as
trivial
we
leave
the
discussion
at
the
end
of
section
ii
at
the
same
point
where
we
entered
it
with
the
clue
to
the
inducement
to
invest
still
to
find
section
iii
is
broader
more
vigorous
and
in
general
more
rewarding
than
the
two
preceding
parts
it
opens
with
a
return
to
marx
model
for
a
capitalist
system
with
accumulation
going
on
our
author
then
sets
out
a
fresh
model
allowing
for
technical
progress
the
rate
of
exploitation
the
ratio
of
surplus
to
wages
is
rising
for
real
wages
remain
constant
while
output
per
man
increases
in
the
model
the
proportion
of
surplus
saved
is
assumed
constant
for
simplicity
though
in
reality
she
holds
it
would
tend
to
rise
with
the
real
income
of
the
capitalists
the
ratio
of
constant
to
variable
capital
is
rising
for
technical
reasons
the
convention
by
which
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
capital
is
identified
with
the
stock
of
capital
now
becomes
a
great
impediment
to
clear
thinking
the
arithmetical
model
shows
the
system
running
into
an
because
the
output
of
department
i
falls
short
of
the
requirements
of
constant
capital
in
the
two
departments
taken
together
while
the
output
of
department
ii
exceeds
consumption
the
method
of
argument
is
by
no
means
rigorous
nothing
follows
from
the
fact
that
one
particular
numerical
example
fails
to
give
a
solution
and
the
example
is
troublesome
to
interpret
as
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
discrepancies
due
to
rounding
off
the
figures
from
those
which
are
intended
to
illustrate
a
point
of
principle
but
there
is
no
need
to
paddle
in
the
arithmetic
to
find
where
the
difficulty
lies
the
model
is
because
of
the
rule
that
the
increment
of
capital
within
each
department
at
the
end
of
a
year
must
equal
the
saving
made
within
the
same
department
during
the
year
if
capitalists
from
department
ii
were
permitted
to
lend
part
of
their
savings
to
department
i
to
be
invested
in
its
capital
a
breakdown
would
no
longer
be
inevitable
suppose
that
total
real
wages
are
constant
and
that
real
consumption
by
capitalists
increases
slowly
so
that
the
real
output
of
department
ii
rises
at
a
slower
rate
than
productivity
then
the
amount
of
labour
employed
in
it
is
shrinking
the
ratio
of
capital
to
labour
however
is
rising
as
a
consequence
of
technical
progress
the
output
of
department
i
and
its
productive
capacity
is
growing
through
time
capital
invested
in
department
i
is
accumulating
faster
than
the
saving
of
the
capitalists
in
department
i
and
capitalists
of
department
ii
who
have
no
profitable
outlet
in
their
own
industries
for
their
savings
acquire
titles
to
part
of
the
capital
in
department
i
by
supplying
the
difference
between
investment
in
department
i
and
its
own
saving
for
any
increase
in
the
stock
of
capital
of
both
departments
taken
together
required
by
technical
progress
and
demand
conditions
there
is
an
appropriate
amount
of
saving
and
so
long
as
the
total
accumulation
required
and
total
saving
fit
there
is
no
breakdown
but
here
we
find
the
clue
to
the
real
contradiction
these
quantities
might
conceivably
fit
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
they
will
if
the
ratio
of
saving
which
the
capitalists
taken
together
choose
to
make
exceeds
the
rate
of
accumulation
dictated
by
technical
progress
the
excess
savings
can
only
be
if
there
is
an
outlet
for
investment
outside
the
system
the
opposite
case
of
deficient
savings
is
also
possible
progress
would
then
be
slowed
down
below
the
technically
possible
maximum
but
this
case
is
not
contemplated
by
our
author
and
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
elaborate
upon
it
once
more
we
can
substitute
for
a
supposed
logical
necessity
a
plausible
hypothesis
about
the
nature
of
the
real
case
and
so
rescue
the
succeeding
argument
if
in
reality
the
distribution
of
income
between
workers
and
capitalists
and
the
propensity
to
save
of
capitalists
are
such
as
to
require
a
rate
of
accumulation
which
exceeds
the
rate
of
increase
in
the
stock
of
capital
appropriate
to
technical
conditions
then
there
is
a
chronic
excess
of
the
potential
supply
of
real
capital
over
the
demand
for
it
and
the
system
must
fall
into
chronic
depression
this
is
the
thesis
thrown
out
by
keynes
and
elaborated
by
modern
american
economists
notably
alvin
hansen
how
then
is
it
that
capitalist
expansion
had
not
yet
in
shown
any
sign
of
slackening
in
chapter
xxvi
rosa
luxemburg
advances
her
central
thesis
that
it
is
the
invasion
of
primitive
economies
by
capitalism
which
keeps
the
system
alive
there
follows
a
scorching
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
capitalist
system
by
trade
conquest
and
theft
swallowed
up
the
economies
some
reduced
to
colonies
of
capitalist
nations
some
remaining
nominally
independent
and
fed
itself
upon
their
ruins
the
thread
of
analysis
running
through
the
historical
illustrations
is
not
easy
to
pick
up
but
the
main
argument
seems
to
be
as
follows
as
soon
as
a
primitive
closed
economy
has
been
broken
into
by
force
or
guile
cheap
consumption
goods
displace
the
old
hand
production
of
the
family
or
village
communities
so
that
a
market
is
provided
for
outputs
from
the
industries
of
department
ii
in
the
old
centres
of
capitalism
without
the
standard
of
life
of
the
workers
who
consume
these
commodities
being
raised
the
capacity
of
the
export
industries
requires
the
products
of
department
i
thus
maintaining
investment
at
home
at
the
same
time
great
capital
works
such
as
railways
are
undertaken
in
the
new
territories
this
investment
is
matched
partly
by
savings
from
surplus
extracted
on
the
spot
but
mainly
by
loans
from
the
old
capitalist
countries
there
is
no
difficulty
here
in
accounting
for
the
inducement
to
invest
for
the
new
territories
yield
commodities
unobtainable
at
home
we
might
set
out
the
essence
of
the
argument
as
follows
cloth
from
lancashire
pays
for
labour
in
america
which
is
used
to
produce
wheat
and
cotton
these
provide
wages
and
raw
materials
to
the
lancashire
mills
while
the
profits
acquired
both
on
the
plantations
and
in
the
mills
are
invested
in
steel
rails
and
rolling
stock
which
open
up
fresh
territories
so
that
the
whole
process
is
continuously
expanding
moreover
apart
from
profits
earned
on
capital
actually
invested
in
the
new
territories
great
capital
gains
are
made
simply
by
acquiring
possession
of
land
and
other
natural
resources
labour
to
work
the
resources
may
be
provided
by
the
local
dispossessed
peasantry
or
by
immigration
from
the
centres
of
capitalism
investment
in
equipment
for
it
to
use
is
more
profitable
than
in
that
operated
by
home
labour
partly
because
the
wretched
condition
of
the
colonial
workers
makes
the
rate
of
exploitation
higher
but
mainly
just
because
they
are
on
the
spot
and
can
turn
the
natural
resources
seized
by
the
capitalists
into
means
of
production
no
amount
of
investment
in
equipment
for
british
labour
would
produce
soil
bearing
cotton
rubber
or
copper
thus
investment
is
deflected
abroad
and
the
promise
of
profit
represented
by
the
natural
resources
calls
into
existence
by
fair
means
or
foul
the
labour
and
capital
to
make
it
come
true
the
process
of
building
up
this
capital
provides
an
outlet
for
the
old
industries
and
rescues
them
from
the
contradictions
inherent
in
deficiency
of
demand
the
analysis
of
militarism
in
the
last
chapter
itself
by
trying
to
prove
too
much
the
argument
is
that
armaments
are
built
up
out
of
taxes
which
fall
entirely
on
wages
this
can
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
saving
imposed
on
the
workers
these
savings
are
extra
to
the
saving
out
of
surplus
they
are
invested
in
armaments
and
that
ends
the
story
on
this
basis
the
armaments
in
themselves
can
not
be
held
to
provide
an
outlet
for
the
investment
of
surplus
though
the
use
of
the
armaments
as
in
the
opium
war
to
break
up
primitive
economies
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
colonial
investment
already
described
and
capital
equipment
to
produce
armaments
is
merely
substituted
for
capital
formerly
producing
consumers
goods
the
analysis
which
best
fits
rosa
luxemburg
own
argument
and
the
facts
is
that
armaments
provide
an
outlet
for
the
investment
of
surplus
over
and
above
any
contribution
there
may
be
from
forced
saving
out
of
wages
which
unlike
other
kinds
of
investment
creates
no
further
problem
by
increasing
productive
capacity
not
to
mention
the
huge
new
investment
opportunities
created
by
reconstruction
after
the
capitalist
nations
have
turned
their
weapons
against
each
other
all
this
is
perhaps
too
neat
an
account
of
what
our
author
is
saying
the
argument
streams
along
bearing
a
welter
of
historical
examples
in
its
flood
and
ideas
emerge
and
disappear
again
bewilderingly
but
something
like
the
above
seems
to
be
intended
and
something
like
it
is
now
widely
accepted
as
being
true
rosa
luxemburg
as
we
have
seen
neglects
the
rise
in
real
wages
which
takes
place
as
capitalism
develops
and
denies
the
internal
inducement
to
invest
provided
by
technical
progress
two
factors
which
help
to
rescue
capitalism
from
the
difficulties
which
it
creates
for
itself
she
is
left
with
only
one
influence
economic
imperialism
to
account
for
continuous
capital
accumulation
so
that
her
analysis
is
incomplete
all
the
same
few
would
deny
that
the
extension
of
capitalism
into
new
territories
was
the
mainspring
of
what
an
academic
economist
has
called
the
secular
boom
of
the
last
two
hundred
years
and
many
academic
economists
account
for
the
uneasy
condition
of
capitalism
in
the
twentieth
century
largely
by
the
of
the
frontier
all
over
the
world
but
the
academic
economists
are
being
wise
after
the
event
for
all
its
confusions
and
exaggerations

book
shows
more
prescience

the
ratio

point

he
could
make

the
problem
of
reproduction
the
object
of
our
investigation
karl
marx
made
a
contribution
of
lasting
service
to
the
theory
of
economics
when
he
drew
attention
to
the
problem
of
the
reproduction
of
the
entire
social
capital
it
is
significant
that
in
the
history
of
economics
we
find
only
two
attempts
at
an
exact
exposition
of
this
problem
one
by
quesnay
the
father
of
the
physiocrats
at
its
very
inception
and
in
its
final
stage
this
attempt
by
marx
in
the
interim
the
problem
was
ever
with
bourgeois
economics
yet
bourgeois
economists
have
never
been
fully
aware
of
this
problem
in
its
pure
aspects
detached
from
related
and
intersecting
minor
problems
they
have
never
been
able
to
formulate
it
precisely
let
alone
solve
it
seeing
that
the
problem
is
of
paramount
importance
their
attempts
may
all
the
same
help
us
to
some
understanding
of
the
trend
of
scientific
economics
what
is
it
precisely
that
constitutes
this
problem
of
the
reproduction
of
total
capital
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word
is
repetition
renewal
of
the
process
of
production
at
first
sight
it
may
be
difficult
to
see
in
what
respect
the
idea
of
reproduction
differs
from
that
of
repetition
which
we
can
all
understand
why
such
a
new
and
unfamiliar
term
should
be
required
but
in
the
sort
of
repetition
which
we
shall
consider
in
the
continual
recurrence
of
the
process
of
production
there
are
certain
distinctive
features
first
the
regular
repetition
of
reproduction
is
the
general
qua
of
regular
consumption
which
in
its
turn
has
been
the
precondition
of
human
civilisation
in
every
one
of
its
historical
forms
the
concept
of
reproduction
viewed
in
this
way
reflects
an
aspect
of
the
history
of
civilisation
production
can
never
be
resumed
there
can
be
no
reproduction
unless
certain
prerequisites
such
as
tools
raw
materials
and
labour
have
been
established
during
the
preceding
period
of
production
however
at
the
most
primitive
level
of
man
civilisation
at
the
initial
stage
of
man
power
over
nature
this
possibility
to
in
production
depended
more
or
less
on
chance
so
long
as
hunting
and
fishing
were
the
main
foundations
of
social
existence
frequent
periods
of
general
starvation
interrupted
the
regular
repetition
of
production
some
primitive
peoples
recognised
at
a
very
early
stage
that
for
reproduction
as
a
regularly
recurring
process
certain
measures
were
essential
these
they
incorporated
into
ceremonies
of
a
religious
nature
and
in
this
way
they
accepted
such
measures
as
traditional
social
commitments
thus
as
the
thorough
researches
of
spencer
and
gillen
have
taught
us
the
totem
cult
of
the
australian
negroes
is
fundamentally
nothing
but
certain
measures
taken
by
social
groups
for
the
purpose
of
securing
and
preserving
their
animal
and
vegetable
foodstuffs
these
precautions
had
been
taken
year
by
year
since
time
immemorial
and
thus
they
became
fossilised
into
religious
ceremonials
yet
the
circle
of
consumption
and
production
which
forms
the
essence
of
reproduction
became
possible
only
with
the
invention
of
tillage
with
the
hoe
with
the
taming
of
domestic
animals
and
with
for
the
purpose
of
consumption
reproduction
is
something
more
than
mere
repetition
in
so
far
as
it
presupposes
a
certain
level
of
society
supremacy
over
nature
or
in
economic
terms
a
certain
standard
of
labour
productivity
on
the
other
hand
at
all
stages
of
social
development
the
process
of
production
is
based
on
the
continuation
of
two
different
though
closely
connected
factors
the
technical
and
social
conditions
on
the
precise
relationship
between
man
and
nature
and
that
between
men
and
men
reproduction
depends
to
the
same
degree
on
both
these
conditions
we
have
just
seen
how
reproduction
is
bound
up
with
the
conditions
of
human
working
techniques
how
far
it
is
indeed
solely
the
result
of
a
certain
level
of
labour
productivity
but
the
social
forms
of
production
prevailing
in
each
case
are
no
less
decisive
in
a
primitive
communist
agrarian
community
reproduction
as
well
as
the
whole
plan
of
economic
life
is
determined
by
the
community
of
all
workers
and
their
democratic
organs
the
decision
to
in
labour
the
organisation
of
labour
the
provision
of
raw
materials
tools
and
as
the
essential
preliminaries
of
labour
the
arrangement
of
reproduction
and
the
determination
of
its
volume
are
all
results
of
a
planned
in
which
everybody
within
the
boundaries
of
the
community
takes
his
part
in
an
economic
system
based
on
slave
labour
or
reproduction
is
enforced
and
regulated
in
all
details
by
personal
relations
of
domination
here
the
volume
of
reproduction
is
determined
by
the
right
of
disposal
held
by
the
ruling
over
smaller
or
larger
circles
of
other
people
labour
in
a
society
producing
by
capitalist
methods
reproduction
assumes
a
peculiar
form
as
a
mere
glance
at
certain
striking
phenomena
will
show
us
in
every
other
society
known
to
history
reproduction
recurs
in
a
regular
sequence
as
far
as
its
preconditions
the
existing
means
of
production
and
labour
power
make
this
possible
as
a
rule
only
external
influences
such
as
a
devastating
war
or
a
great
pestilence
depopulating
vast
areas
of
former
cultural
life
and
consequently
destroying
masses
of
labour
power
and
of
accumulated
means
of
production
can
result
in
a
complete
interruption
of
reproduction
or
in
its
contraction
to
any
considerable
extent
for
longer
or
shorter
periods
a
despotic
organisation
of
the
plan
of
production
may
on
occasion
lead
to
similar
phenomena
when
in
ancient
egypt
pharaoh
will
chained
thousands
of
fellaheen
for
decades
to
the
building
of
the
pyramids
when
in
modern
egypt
ismail
pasha
ordered
fellaheen
to
forced
labour
on
the
suez
canal
or
when
about
two
hundred
years
before
christ
the
emperor
shi
hoang
ti
founder
of
the
chin
dynasty
allowed
people
to
perish
of
hunger
and
exhaustion
and
thus
sacrificed
a
whole
generation
to
his
purpose
of
consolidating
the
great
wall
at
china
northern
frontier
the
result
was
always
that
vast
stretches
of
arable
land
were
left
fallow
and
that
regular
economic
life
was
interrupted
for
long
periods
in
all
these
cases
the
causes
of
these
interruptions
of
reproduction
obviously
lay
in
the
determination
of
the
plan
of
reproduction
by
those
in
power
societies
which
produce
according
to
capitalist
methods
present
a
different
picture
we
observe
that
in
certain
periods
all
the
ingredients
of
reproduction
may
be
available
both
labour
and
means
of
production
and
yet
some
vital
needs
of
society
for
consumer
goods
may
be
left
unfulfilled
we
find
that
in
spite
of
these
resources
reproduction
may
in
part
be
completely
suspended
and
in
part
curtailed
here
it
is
no
despotic
interference
with
the
economic
plan
that
is
responsible
for
the
difficulties
in
the
process
of
production
quite
apart
from
all
technical
conditions
reproduction
here
depends
on
purely
social
considerations
only
those
goods
are
produced
which
can
with
certainty
be
expected
to
sell
and
not
merely
to
sell
but
to
sell
at
the
customary
profit
thus
profit
becomes
an
end
in
itself
the
decisive
factor
which
determines
not
only
production
but
also
reproduction
not
only
does
it
decide
in
each
case
what
work
is
to
be
undertaken
how
it
is
to
be
carried
out
and
how
the
products
are
to
be
distributed
what
is
more
profit
decides
also
at
the
end
of
every
working
period
whether
the
labour
process
is
to
be
resumed
and
if
so
to
what
extent
and
in
what
direction
it
should
be
made
to
operate
in
capitalist
society
therefore
the
process
of
reproduction
as
a
whole
constitutes
a
peculiar
and
most
complicated
problem
in
consequence
of
these
purely
historical
and
social
factors
there
is
as
we
shall
see
an
external
characteristic
which
shows
clearly
this
specific
historical
peculiarity
of
the
capitalist
process
of
reproduction
comprising
not
only
production
but
also
circulation
the
process
of
exchange
it
unites
these
two
elements
capitalist
production
is
primarily
production
by
innumerable
private
producers
without
any
planned
regulation
the
only
social
link
between
these
producers
is
the
act
of
exchange
in
taking
account
of
social
requirements
reproduction
has
no
clue
to
go
on
other
than
the
experiences
of
the
preceding
labour
period
these
experiences
however
remain
the
private
experiences
of
individual
producers
and
are
not
integrated
into
a
comprehensive
and
social
form
moreover
they
do
not
always
refer
positively
and
directly
to
the
needs
of
society
they
are
often
rather
indirect
and
negative
for
it
is
only
on
the
basis
of
price
fluctuations
that
they
indicate
whether
the
aggregate
of
produced
commodities
falls
short
of
the
effective
demand
or
exceeds
it
yet
the
individual
private
producers
make
recurrent
use
of
these
experiences
of
the
preceding
labour
period
when
they
in
reproduction
so
that
glut
or
shortage
are
bound
to
occur
again
in
the
following
period
individual
branches
of
production
may
develop
independently
so
that
there
may
be
a
surplus
in
one
branch
and
a
deficiency
in
another
but
as
nearly
all
individual
branches
of
production
are
interdependent
technically
glut
or
shortage
in
some
of
the
larger
branches
of
production
lead
to
the
same
phenomenon
in
most
of
the
others
thus
the
general
supply
of
products
may
alternate
periodically
between
shortage
and
surplus
relative
to
the
social
demand
herein
lies
the
peculiar
character
of
reproduction
in
a
capitalist
society
which
differs
from
all
other
known
forms
of
production
in
the
first
place
every
branch
of
production
develops
independently
within
certain
limits
in
a
way
that
leads
to
periodical
interruptions
of
production
of
shorter
or
longer
duration
secondly
the
individual
branches
of
reproduction
show
deviations
from
social
requirements
amounting
to
disparity
and
thus
resulting
in
a
general
interruption
of
reproduction
these
features
of
capitalist
reproduction
are
quite
characteristic
in
all
other
economic
systems
reproduction
runs
its
uninterrupted
and
regular
course
apart
from
external
disturbance
by
violence
capitalist
reproduction
however
to
quote
sismondi
dictum
can
only
be
represented
as
a
continuous
sequence
of
individual
spirals
every
such
spiral
starts
with
small
loops
which
become
increasingly
larger
and
eventually
very
large
indeed
then
they
contract
and
a
new
spiral
starts
again
with
small
loops
repeating
the
figure
up
to
the
point
of
interruption
this
periodical
fluctuation
between
the
largest
volume
of
reproduction
and
its
contraction
to
partial
suspension
this
cycle
of
slump
boom
and
crisis
as
it
has
been
called
is
the
most
striking
peculiarity
of
capitalist
reproduction
it
is
very
important
however
to
establish
quite
firmly
and
from
the
very
outset
that
this
cyclical
movement
of
boom
slump
and
crisis
does
not
represent
the
whole
problem
of
capitalist
reproduction
although
it
is
an
essential
element
of
it
periodical
cycles
and
crises
are
specific
phases
of
reproduction
in
a
capitalist
system
of
economy
but
not
the
whole
of
this
process
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
pure
implications
of
capitalist
reproduction
we
must
rather
consider
it
quite
apart
from
the
periodical
cycles
and
crises
strange
as
this
may
appear
the
method
is
quite
rational
it
is
indeed
the
only
method
of
inquiry
that
is
scientifically
tenable
in
order
to
demonstrate
and
to
solve
the
problem
of
pure
value
we
must
leave
price
fluctuations
out
of
consideration
the
approach
of
vulgar
economics
always
attempts
to
solve
the
problem
of
value
by
reference
to
fluctuations
in
demand
and
supply
classical
economists
from
adam
smith
to
karl
marx
attack
the
problem
in
the
opposite
way
pointing
out
that
fluctuations
in
the
mutual
relation
between
demand
and
supply
can
explain
only
disparities
between
price
and
value
not
value
itself
in
order
to
find
the
value
of
a
commodity
we
must
start
by
assuming
that
demand
and
supply
are
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
that
the
price
of
a
commodity
and
its
value
closely
correspond
to
one
another
thus
the
scientific
problem
of
value
begins
at
the
very
point
where
the
effect
of
demand
and
supply
ceases
to
operate
in
consequence
of
periodical
cycles
and
crises
capitalist
reproduction
fluctuates
as
a
rule
around
the
level
of
the
effective
total
demand
of
society
sometimes
rising
above
and
sometimes
falling
below
this
level
contracting
occasionally
even
to
the
point
of
almost
complete
interruption
of
reproduction
however
if
we
consider
a
longer
period
a
whole
cycle
with
its
alternating
phases
of
prosperity
and
depression
of
boom
and
slump
that
is
if
we
consider
reproduction
at
its
highest
and
lowest
volume
including
the
stage
of
suspension
we
can
set
off
boom
against
slump
and
work
out
an
average
a
mean
volume
of
reproduction
for
the
whole
cycle
this
average
is
not
only
a
theoretical
figment
of
thought
it
is
also
a
real
objective
fact
for
in
spite
of
the
sharp
rises
and
falls
in
the
course
of
a
cycle
in
spite
of
crises
the
needs
of
society
are
always
satisfied
more
or
less
reproduction
continues
on
its
complicated
course
and
productive
capacities
develop
progressively
how
can
this
take
place
leaving
cycles
and
crises
out
of
consideration
here
the
real
question
begins
the
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
reproduction
in
terms
of
the
periodical
character
of
crises
is
fundamentally
a
device
of
vulgar
economics
just
like
the
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
value
in
terms
of
fluctuations
in
demand
and
supply
nevertheless
we
shall
see
in
the
course
of
our
observations
that
as
soon
as
economic
theory
gets
an
inkling
of
the
problem
of
reproduction
as
soon
as
it
has
at
least
started
guessing
at
the
problem
it
reveals
a
persistent
tendency
suddenly
to
transform
the
problem
of
reproduction
into
the
problem
of
crises
thus
barring
its
own
way
to
the
solution
of
the
question
when
we
speak
of
capitalist
reproduction
in
the
following
exposition
we
shall
always
understand
by
this
term
a
mean
volume
of
productivity
which
is
an
average
taken
over
the
various
phases
of
a
cycle
now
the
total
of
capitalist
reproduction
is
created
by
an
unlimited
and
constantly
changing
number
of
private
producers
they
produce
independently
of
one
another
apart
from
the
observation
of
price
fluctuations
there
is
no
social
control
no
social
link
exists
between
the
individual
producers
other
than
the
exchange
of
commodities
the
question
arises
how
these
innumerable
disconnected
operations
can
lead
to
the
actual
total
of
production
this
general
aspect
of
our
problem
indeed
strikes
us
immediately
as
one
of
prime
importance
but
if
we
put
it
this
way
we
overlook
the
fact
that
such
private
producers
are
not
simply
producers
of
commodities
but
are
essentially
capitalist
producers
that
the
total
production
of
society
is
not
simply
production
for
the
sake
of
satisfying
social
requirements
and
equally
not
merely
production
of
commodities
but
essentially
capitalist
production
let
us
examine
our
problem
anew
in
the
light
of
this
fact
a
producer
who
produces
not
only
commodities
but
capital
must
above
all
create
surplus
value
the
capitalist
producer
final
goal
his
main
incentive
is
the
production
of
surplus
value
the
proceeds
from
the
commodities
he
has
manufactured
must
not
only
recompense
him
for
all
his
outlay
but
in
addition
they
must
yield
him
a
value
which
does
not
correspond
with
any
expense
on
his
part
and
is
pure
gain
if
we
consider
the
process
of
production
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
creation
of
surplus
value
we
see
that
the
capital
advanced
by
the
capitalist
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
part
represents
his
expenses
on
means
of
production
such
as
premises
raw
material
partly
finished
goods
and
machinery
the
second
part
is
spent
on
wages
this
holds
good
even
if
the
capitalist
producer
does
not
know
it
himself
and
in
spite
of
the
pious
stuff
about
fixed
and
circulating
capital
with
which
he
may
delude
himself
and
the
world
marx
called
this
first
part
constant
capital
its
value
is
not
changed
by
its
utilisation
in
the
labour
process
it
is
transferred
to
the
finished
product
the
second
part
marx
calls
the
variable
capital
this
gives
rise
to
an
additional
value
which
materialises
when
the
results
of
unpaid
labour
are
appropriated
the
various
components
which
make
up
the
value
of
every
commodity
produced
by
capitalist
methods
may
be
expressed
by
the
formula
v
in
this
formula
stands
for
the
value
of
the
constant
capital
laid
out
in
inanimate
means
of
production
and
transferred
to
the
commodity
stands
for
the
value
of
the
variable
capital
advanced
in
form
of
wages
and
stands
for
the
surplus
value
the
additional
value
of
the
unpaid
part
of
wage
labour
every
type
of
goods
shows
these
three
components
of
value
whether
we
consider
an
individual
commodity
or
the
aggregate
of
commodities
as
a
whole
whether
we
consider
cotton
textiles
or
ballet
performances
tubes
or
liberal
newspapers
thus
for
the
capitalist
producer
the
manufacture
of
commodities
is
not
an
end
in
itself
it
is
only
a
means
to
the
appropriation
of
surplus
value
this
surplus
value
however
can
be
of
no
use
to
the
capitalist
so
long
as
it
remains
hidden
in
the
commodity
form
of
the
product
once
the
commodity
has
been
produced
it
must
be
realised
it
must
be
converted
into
a
form
of
pure
value
that
is
into
money
all
capital
expenses
incorporated
in
the
commodity
must
shed
their
and
revert
to
the
capitalist
as
money
to
make
this
conversion
possible
so
that
he
can
appropriate
the
surplus
value
in
cash
the
purpose
of
production
is
fulfilled
only
when
this
conversion
has
been
successful
only
when
the
aggregate
of
commodities
has
been
sold
according
to
its
value
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
of
commodities
the
money
that
has
been
received
for
them
contains
the
same
components
of
value
as
the
former
aggregate
of
commodities
and
can
be
expressed
by
the
same
formula
v
part
recompenses
the
capitalist
for
his
advances
on
means
of
production
that
have
been
used
up
part
recompenses
him
for
his
advances
on
wages
and
the
last
part
represents
the
expected
surplus
the
capitalist
clear
profit
in
cash
this
conversion
of
capital
from
its
original
form
from
the
starting
point
of
all
capitalist
production
into
means
of
production
dead
and
living
such
as
raw
materials
instruments
and
labour
its
further
conversion
into
commodities
by
a
living
labour
process
and
its
final
reconversion
into
money
a
greater
amount
of
money
indeed
than
at
the
initial
stage
this
transformation
of
capital
is
however
required
for
more
than
the
production
and
appropriation
of
surplus
value
the
aim
and
incentive
of
capitalist
production
is
not
a
surplus
value
pure
and
simple
to
be
appropriated
in
any
desired
quantity
but
a
surplus
value
ever
growing
into
larger
quantities
surplus
value
but
to
achieve
this
aim
the
same
magic
means
must
be
used
over
and
over
again
the
means
of
capitalist
production
the
ever
repeated
appropriation
of
the
proceeds
of
unpaid
wage
labour
in
the
process
of
commodity
manufacture
and
the
subsequent
realisation
of
the
commodities
so
produced
thus
quite
a
new
incentive
is
given
to
constantly
renewed
production
to
the
process
of
reproduction
as
a
regular
phenomenon
in
capitalist
society
an
incentive
unknown
to
any
other
system
of
production
in
every
other
economic
system
known
to
history
reproduction
is
determined
by
the
unceasing
need
of
society
for
consumer
goods
whether
they
are
the
needs
of
all
the
workers
determined
in
a
democratic
manner
as
in
an
agrarian
and
communist
market
community
or
the
despotically
determined
needs
of
an
antagonistic
class
society
as
in
an
economy
of
slave
labour
or
and
the
like
but
in
a
capitalist
system
of
production
it
is
not
consideration
of
social
needs
which
actuates
the
individual
private
producer
who
alone
matters
in
this
connection
his
production
is
determined
entirely
by
the
effective
demand
and
even
this
is
to
him
a
mere
means
for
the
realisation
of
surplus
value
which
for
him
is
indispensable
appropriation
of
surplus
value
is
his
real
incentive
and
production
of
consumer
goods
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
effective
demand
is
only
a
detour
when
we
look
to
the
real
motive
that
of
appropriation
of
surplus
value
although
for
the
individual
capitalist
it
is
also
a
rule
of
necessity
this
motive
to
appropriate
surplus
value
also
urges
him
to
in
reproduction
over
and
over
again
it
is
the
production
of
surplus
value
which
turns
reproduction
of
social
necessities
into
a
reproduction
for
its
part
can
obviously
be
only
resumed
when
the
products
of
the
previous
period
the
commodities
have
been
realised
that
is
converted
into
money
for
capital
in
the
form
of
money
in
the
form
of
pure
value
must
always
be
the
starting
point
of
reproduction
in
a
capitalist
system
the
first
condition
of
reproduction
for
the
capitalist
producer
is
thus
seen
to
be
a
successful
realisation
of
the
commodities
produced
during
the
preceding
period
of
production
now
we
come
to
a
second
important
point
under
a
system
of
private
economy
it
is
the
individual
producer
who
determines
the
volume
of
reproduction
at
his
discretion
his
main
incentive
is
appropriation
of
surplus
value
indeed
an
appropriation
increasing
as
rapidly
as
possible
an
accelerated
appropriation
of
surplus
value
however
necessitates
an
increased
production
of
capital
to
generate
this
surplus
value
here
a
enterprise
enjoys
advantages
over
a
small
one
in
every
respect
in
fine
the
capitalist
method
of
production
furnishes
not
only
a
permanent
incentive
to
reproduction
in
general
but
also
a
motive
for
its
expansion
for
reproduction
on
an
ever
larger
scale
nor
is
that
all
capitalist
methods
of
production
do
more
than
awaken
in
the
capitalist
this
thirst
for
surplus
value
whereby
he
is
impelled
to
ceaseless
expansion
of
reproduction
expansion
becomes
in
truth
a
coercive
law
an
economic
condition
of
existence
for
the
individual
capitalist
under
the
rule
of
competition
cheapness
of
commodities
is
the
most
important
weapon
of
the
individual
capitalist
in
his
struggle
for
a
place
in
the
market
now
all
methods
of
reducing
the
cost
of
commodity
production
permanently
amount
in
the
end
to
an
expansion
of
production
excepting
those
only
which
aim
at
a
specific
increase
of
the
rate
of
surplus
value
by
measures
such
as
or
lengthening
the
hours
of
work
as
for
these
latter
devices
they
are
as
such
likely
to
encounter
many
obstacles
in
this
respect
a
large
enterprise
invariably
enjoys
advantages
of
every
kind
over
a
small
or
medium
concern
they
may
range
from
a
saving
in
premises
or
instruments
in
the
application
of
more
efficient
means
of
production
in
extensive
replacement
of
manual
labour
by
machinery
down
to
a
speedy
exploitation
of
a
favourable
turn
of
the
market
so
as
to
acquire
raw
materials
cheaply
within
very
wide
limits
these
advantages
increase
in
direct
proportion
to
the
expansion
of
the
enterprise
thus
as
soon
as
a
few
capitalist
enterprises
have
been
enlarged
competition
itself
forces
all
others
to
expand
likewise
expansion
becomes
a
condition
of
existence
a
growing
tendency
towards
reproduction
at
a
progressively
increasing
scale
thus
ensues
which
spreads
automatically
like
a
tidal
wave
over
ever
larger
surfaces
of
reproduction
expanding
reproduction
is
not
a
new
discovery
of
capital
on
the
contrary
it
had
been
the
rule
since
time
immemorial
in
every
form
of
society
that
displayed
economic
and
cultural
progress
it
is
true
of
course
that
simple
reproduction
as
a
mere
continuous
repetition
of
the
process
of
production
on
the
same
scale
as
before
can
be
observed
over
long
periods
of
social
history
in
the
ancient
agrarian
and
communist
village
communities
for
instance
increase
in
population
did
not
lead
to
a
gradual
expansion
of
production
but
rather
to
the
new
generation
being
expelled
and
the
subsequent
founding
of
equally
small
and
colonies
the
old
small
handicraft
units
of
india
and
china
provide
similar
instances
of
a
traditional
repetition
of
production
in
the
same
forms
and
on
the
same
scale
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
but
simple
reproduction
is
in
all
these
cases
the
source
and
unmistakable
sign
of
a
general
economic
and
cultural
stagnation
no
important
forward
step
in
production
no
memorial
of
civilisation
such
as
the
great
waterworks
of
the
east
the
pyramids
of
egypt
the
military
roads
of
rome
the
arts
and
sciences
of
greece
or
the
development
of
craftsmanship
and
towns
in
the
middle
ages
would
have
been
possible
without
expanding
reproduction
for
the
basis
and
also
the
social
incentive
for
a
decisive
advancement
of
civilisation
lies
solely
in
the
gradual
expansion
of
production
beyond
immediate
requirements
and
in
a
continual
growth
of
the
population
itself
as
well
as
of
its
demands
exchange
in
particular
which
brought
about
a
class
society
and
its
historical
development
into
the
capitalist
form
of
economy
would
have
been
unthinkable
without
expanding
reproduction
in
a
capitalist
society
moreover
expanding
reproduction
acquires
certain
characteristics
as
we
have
already
mentioned
it
becomes
right
away
a
coercive
law
to
the
individual
capitalist
capitalist
methods
of
production
do
not
exclude
simple
or
even
retrogressive
reproduction
indeed
this
is
responsible
for
the
periodical
phenomenon
of
crises
following
phases
likewise
periodical
of
overstrained
expansion
of
reproduction
in
times
of
boom
but
ignoring
periodical
fluctuations
the
general
trend
of
reproduction
is
ever
towards
expansion
for
the
individual
capitalist
failure
to
keep
abreast
of
this
expansion
means
quitting
the
competitive
struggle
economic
death
moreover
there
are
certain
other
aspects
to
be
considered
the
concept
of
expanding
reproduction
applies
only
to
the
quantity
of
products
to
the
aggregate
of
manufactured
objects
so
long
as
production
rests
solely
or
mainly
upon
a
natural
economy
consumption
determines
the
extent
and
character
of
the
individual
labour
process
as
well
as
that
of
reproduction
in
general
as
an
end
in
itself
this
applies
to
the
agrarian
and
communist
village
communities
of
india
to
the
roman
with
its
economy
of
slave
labour
and
to
the
medieval
feudal
farm
based
on
but
the
picture
is
different
in
a
capitalist
economic
system
capitalist
production
is
not
production
for
the
purpose
of
consumption
it
is
production
for
the
purpose
of
creating
value
the
whole
process
of
production
as
well
as
of
reproduction
is
ruled
by
value
relationships
capitalist
production
is
not
the
production
of
consumer
goods
nor
is
it
merely
the
production
of
commodities
it
is
the
production
of
surplus
value
expanding
reproduction
from
a
capitalist
point
of
view
is
expanding
production
of
surplus
value
though
it
takes
place
in
the
forms
of
commodity
production
and
is
thus
in
the
last
instance
the
production
of
consumer
goods
changes
in
the
productivity
of
labour
during
the
course
of
reproduction
cause
continual
discrepancies
between
these
two
aspects
if
productivity
increases
the
same
amount
of
capital
and
surplus
value
may
represent
a
progressively
larger
amount
of
consumer
goods
expanding
production
understood
as
the
creation
of
a
greater
amount
of
surplus
value
need
not
therefore
necessarily
imply
expanding
reproduction
in
the
capitalist
meaning
of
the
term
conversely
capital
may
within
limits
yield
a
greater
surplus
value
in
consequence
of
a
higher
degree
of
exploitation
such
as
is
brought
about
by
and
the
like
without
actually
producing
a
greater
amount
of
goods
but
in
both
cases
the
surplus
value
has
a
twofold
aspect
it
is
a
quantity
of
value
as
well
as
an
aggregate
of
material
products
and
from
a
capitalist
point
of
view
its
elements
in
both
instances
are
thus
the
same
as
a
rule
an
increased
production
of
surplus
value
results
from
an
increase
of
capital
brought
about
by
addition
of
part
of
the
appropriated
surplus
value
to
the
original
capital
no
matter
whether
this
capitalist
surplus
value
is
used
for
the
expansion
of
an
old
enterprise
or
for
founding
a
new
one
an
independent
offshoot
capitalist
expanding
reproduction
thus
acquires
the
specific
characteristics
of
an
increase
in
capital
by
means
of
a
progressive
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
or
as
marx
has
put
it
by
the
accumulation
of
capital
the
general
formula
for
enlarged
reproduction
under
the
rule
of
capital
thus
runs
as
follows
v
here
stands
for
the
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
appropriated
in
an
earlier
period
of
production
stands
for
the
new
surplus
value
created
by
the
increased
capital
part
of
this
new
surplus
value
is
capitalised
again
and
expanding
reproduction
is
thus
from
the
capitalist
point
of
view
a
constantly
flowing
process
of
alternate
appropriation
and
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
so
far
however
we
have
only
arrived
at
a
general
and
abstract
formula
for
reproduction
let
us
now
consider
more
closely
the
concrete
conditions
which
are
necessary
to
apply
this
formula
the
surplus
value
which
has
been
appropriated
after
it
has
successfully
cast
off
its
in
the
market
appears
as
a
given
amount
of
money
this
is
the
form
of
its
absolute
value
the
beginning
of
its
career
as
capital
but
as
it
is
impossible
to
create
surplus
value
with
money
it
can
not
in
this
form
advance
beyond
the
threshold
of
its
career
capital
must
assume
so
that
the
particular
portion
of
it
which
is
earmarked
for
accumulation
can
be
capitalised
for
only
in
this
form
can
it
become
productive
capital
that
is
capital
begetting
new
surplus
value
therefore
like
the
original
capital
it
must
again
be
divided
into
two
parts
a
constant
part
comprising
the
inanimate
means
of
production
and
a
variable
part
the
wages
only
then
will
our
formula
v
apply
to
it
in
the
same
way
as
it
applied
to
the
old
capital
but
the
good
intent
of
the
capitalist
to
accumulate
his
thrift
and
abstinence
which
make
him
use
the
greater
part
of
his
surplus
value
for
production
instead
of
squandering
it
on
personal
luxuries
is
not
sufficient
for
this
purpose
on
the
contrary
it
is
essential
that
he
should
find
on
the
commodity
market
the
concrete
forms
which
he
intends
to
give
his
new
surplus
value
in
the
first
place
he
must
secure
the
material
means
of
production
such
as
raw
materials
machines
etc
required
for
the
branch
of
production
he
has
chosen
and
planned
so
that
the
particular
part
of
the
surplus
value
which
corresponds
to
his
constant
capital
may
assume
a
productive
form
secondly
the
other
variable
part
of
his
surplus
value
must
also
be
convertible
and
two
essentials
are
necessary
for
this
conversion
of
first
importance
the
labour
market
must
offer
a
sufficient
quantity
of
additional
labour
and
secondly
as
the
workers
can
not
live
on
money
alone
the
commodity
market
too
must
offer
an
additional
amount
of
provisions
which
the
workers
newly
to
be
employed
may
exchange
against
the
variable
part
of
the
surplus
value
they
will
get
from
the
capitalist
all
these
prerequisites
found
the
capitalist
can
set
his
capitalised
surplus
value
to
work
and
make
it
as
operating
capital
beget
new
surplus
value
but
still
his
task
is
not
completely
done
both
the
new
capital
and
the
surplus
value
produced
still
exist
for
the
time
being
in
the
shape
of
an
additional
quantity
of
some
commodity
or
other
in
this
form
the
new
capital
is
but
advanced
and
the
new
surplus
value
created
by
it
is
still
in
a
form
in
which
it
is
of
no
use
to
the
capitalist
the
new
capital
as
well
as
the
surplus
value
which
it
has
created
must
cast
off
their
the
form
of
pure
value
and
thus
revert
to
the
capitalist
as
money
unless
this
process
is
successfully
concluded
the
new
capital
and
surplus
value
will
be
wholly
or
partly
lost
the
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
will
have
miscarried
and
there
will
have
been
no
accumulation
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
accumulation
of
capital
that
a
sufficient
quantity
of
commodities
created
by
the
new
capital
should
win
a
place
for
itself
on
the
market
and
be
realised
thus
we
see
that
expanding
reproduction
as
accumulation
of
capital
in
a
capitalist
system
is
bound
up
with
a
whole
series
of
special
conditions
let
us
look
at
these
more
closely
the
first
condition
is
that
production
should
create
surplus
value
for
surplus
value
is
the
elementary
form
in
which
alone
increased
production
is
possible
under
capitalist
conditions
the
entire
process
of
production
must
abide
by
this
condition
when
determining
the
relations
between
capitalist
and
worker
in
the
production
of
commodities
once
this
first
condition
is
given
the
second
is
that
surplus
value
must
be
realised
converted
into
the
form
of
money
so
that
it
can
be
appropriated
for
the
purposes
of
expanding
reproduction
this
second
condition
thus
leads
us
to
the
commodity
market
here
the
hazards
of
exchange
decide
the
further
fate
of
the
surplus
value
and
thus
the
future
of
reproduction
the
third
condition
is
as
follows
provided
that
part
of
the
realised
surplus
value
has
been
added
to
capital
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
this
new
capital
must
first
assume
its
productive
form
of
labour
and
inanimate
means
of
production
moreover
that
part
of
it
which
had
been
exchanged
for
labour
must
be
converted
into
provisions
for
the
workers
thus
we
are
led
again
to
the
markets
of
labour
and
commodities
if
all
these
requirements
have
been
met
and
enlarged
reproduction
of
commodities
has
taken
place
a
fourth
condition
must
be
added
the
additional
quantity
of
commodities
representing
the
new
capital
plus
surplus
value
will
have
to
be
realised
that
is
reconverted
into
money
only
if
this
conversion
has
been
successful
can
it
be
said
that
expanding
capitalist
reproduction
has
actually
taken
place
this
last
condition
leads
us
back
to
the
commodity
market
thus
capitalist
production
and
reproduction
imply
a
constant
shifting
between
the
place
of
production
and
the
commodity
market
a
shuttle
movement
from
the
private
office
and
the
factory
where
unauthorised
persons
are
strictly
excluded
where
the
sovereign
will
of
the
individual
capitalist
is
the
highest
law
to
the
commodity
market
where
nobody
sets
up
any
laws
and
where
neither
will
nor
reason
assert
themselves
but
it
is
this
very
licence
and
anarchy
of
the
commodity
market
which
brings
home
to
the
individual
capitalist
that
he
is
dependent
upon
society
upon
the
entirety
of
its
producing
and
consuming
members
the
individual
capitalist
may
need
additional
means
of
production
additional
labour
and
provisions
for
these
workers
in
order
to
expand
reproduction
but
whether
he
can
get
what
he
needs
depends
upon
factors
and
events
beyond
his
control
materialising
as
it
were
behind
his
back
in
order
to
realise
his
increased
aggregate
of
products
the
individual
capitalist
requires
a
larger
market
for
his
goods
but
he
has
no
control
whatever
over
the
actual
increase
of
demand
in
general
or
of
the
particular
demand
for
his
special
kind
of
good
the
conditions
we
have
enumerated
here
which
all
give
expression
to
the
inherent
contradiction
between
consumption
and
private
production
and
their
social
interconnection
are
nothing
new
and
it
is
not
only
at
the
stage
of
reproduction
that
they
become
apparent
these
conditions
express
the
general
contradiction
inherent
in
capitalist
production
they
involve
however
particular
difficulties
as
regards
the
process
of
reproduction
for
the
following
reasons
with
regard
to
reproduction
especially
expanding
reproduction
the
capitalist
method
of
production
not
only
reveals
its
general
fundamental
character
but
what
is
more
it
shows
in
the
various
periods
of
production
a
definite
rhythm
within
a
continuous
progression
the
characteristic
interplay
of
individual
wills
from
this
point
of
view
we
must
inquire
in
a
general
way
how
it
is
possible
for
every
individual
capitalist
to
find
on
the
market
the
means
of
production
and
the
labour
he
requires
for
the
purpose
of
realising
the
commodities
he
has
produced
although
there
exists
no
social
control
whatever
no
plan
to
harmonize
production
and
demand
this
question
may
be
answered
by
saying
that
the
capitalist
greed
for
surplus
value
enhanced
by
competition
and
the
automatic
effects
of
capitalist
exploitation
lead
to
the
production
of
every
kind
of
commodity
including
means
of
production
and
also
that
a
growing
class
of
proletarianised
workers
becomes
generally
available
for
the
purposes
of
capital
on
the
other
hand
the
lack
of
a
plan
in
this
respect
shows
itself
in
the
fact
that
the
balance
between
demand
and
supply
in
all
spheres
can
be
achieved
only
by
continuous
deviations
by
hourly
fluctuations
of
prices
and
by
periodical
crises
and
changes
of
the
market
situation
from
the
point
of
view
of
reproduction
the
question
is
a
different
one
how
is
it
possible
that
the
unplanned
supply
in
the
market
for
labour
and
means
of
production
and
the
unplanned
and
incalculable
changes
in
demand
nevertheless
provide
adequate
quantities
and
qualities
of
means
of
production
labour
and
opportunities
for
selling
which
the
individual
capitalist
needs
in
order
to
make
a
sale
how
can
it
be
assured
that
every
one
of
these
factors
increases
in
the
right
proportion
let
us
put
the
problem
more
precisely
according
to
our
formula
let
the
composition
of
the
individual
capitalist
production
be
expressed
by
the
proportion
his
constant
capital
is
consequently
four
times
as
much
as
his
variable
capital
and
the
rate
of
exploitation
is
per
cent
the
aggregate
of
commodities
is
thus
represented
by
a
value
of
let
us
now
assume
that
the
capitalist
is
in
a
position
to
capitalise
and
to
add
to
the
old
capital
of
this
given
composition
half
of
his
surplus
value
in
this
case
the
formula
would
apply
to
the
next
period
of
production
let
us
assume
now
that
the
capitalist
can
continue
the
annual
capitalisation
of
half
his
surplus
value
for
a
number
of
years
for
this
purpose
it
is
not
sufficient
that
means
of
production
labour
and
markets
in
general
should
be
forthcoming
but
he
must
find
these
factors
in
a
proportion
that
is
strictly
in
keeping
with
his
progress
in
accumulation
footnotes
production
be
capitalistic
in
form
so
too
will
be
reproduction
vol
i
surplus
value
in
our
exposition
is
identical
with
profit
this
is
true
for
production
as
a
whole
which
alone
is
of
account
in
our
further
observations
for
the
time
being
we
shall
not
deal
with
the
further
division
of
surplus
value
into
its
component
parts
profit
of
enterprise
interest
and
rent
as
this
subdivision
is
immaterial
to
the
problem
of
reproduction
quesnay
and
adam
smith
analyses
of
the
process
of
reproduction
so
far
we
have
taken
account
only
of
the
individual
capitalist
in
our
survey
of
reproduction
he
is
its
typical
representative
its
agent
for
reproduction
is
indeed
brought
about
entirely
by
individual
capitalist
enterprises
this
approach
has
already
shown
us
that
the
problem
involves
difficulties
enough
yet
these
difficulties
increase
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
become
even
more
complicated
when
we
turn
our
attention
from
the
individual
capitalist
to
the
totality
of
capitalists
a
superficial
glance
suffices
to
show
that
capitalist
reproduction
as
a
social
whole
must
not
be
regarded
simply
as
a
mechanical
summation
of
all
the
separate
processes
of
individual
capitalist
reproduction
we
have
seen
for
instance
that
one
of
the
fundamental
conditions
for
enlarged
reproduction
by
an
individual
capitalist
is
a
corresponding
increase
of
his
opportunities
to
sell
on
the
commodity
market
but
the
individual
capitalist
may
not
always
expand
because
of
an
absolute
increase
in
the
absorptive
capacity
of
the
market
but
also
as
a
result
of
the
competitive
struggle
at
the
cost
of
other
individual
capitalists
thus
one
capitalist
may
win
what
another
or
many
others
who
have
been
shouldered
from
the
market
must
write
off
as
a
loss
this
process
will
enable
one
capitalist
to
increase
his
reproduction
by
the
amount
that
it
compels
others
by
losses
to
restrict
their
own
one
capitalist
will
be
able
to
engage
in
enlarged
reproduction
because
others
can
not
even
achieve
simple
reproduction
in
the
same
way
one
capitalist
may
enlarge
his
reproduction
by
using
labour
power
and
means
of
production
which
another
bankruptcy
that
is
his
partial
or
complete
retirement
from
reproduction
has
set
free
these
commonplaces
prove
that
reproduction
of
the
social
capital
as
a
whole
is
not
the
same
as
the
reproduction
of
the
individual
capitalist
raised
to
the
degree
they
show
that
the
reproductive
activities
of
individual
capitalists
ceaselessly
cut
across
one
another
and
to
a
greater
or
smaller
degree
may
cancel
each
other
out
therefore
we
must
clarify
our
concept
of
reproduction
of
capital
as
a
whole
before
we
examine
the
laws
and
mechanisms
of
capitalist
total
reproduction
we
must
raise
the
question
whether
it
is
even
possible
to
deduce
anything
like
total
reproduction
from
the
disorderly
jumble
of
individual
capitals
in
constant
motion
changing
from
moment
to
moment
according
to
uncontrollable
and
incalculable
laws
partly
running
a
parallel
course
and
partly
intersecting
and
cancelling
each
other
out
can
one
actually
talk
of
total
social
capital
of
society
as
an
entity
and
if
so
what
is
the
real
meaning
of
this
concept
that
is
the
first
question
a
scientific
examination
of
the
laws
of
reproduction
has
to
consider
at
the
dawn
of
economic
theory
and
bourgeois
economics
quesnay
the
father
of
the
physiocrats
approached
the
problem
with
classical
fearlessness
and
simplicity
and
took
it
for
granted
that
total
capital
exists
as
a
real
and
active
entity
in
his
famous
so
intricate
that
no
one
before
marx
could
understand
it
quesnay
demonstrated
the
phases
of
the
reproduction
of
aggregate
capital
with
a
few
figures
at
the
same
time
taking
into
account
that
it
must
also
be
considered
from
the
aspect
of
commodity
exchange
that
is
as
a
process
of
circulation
society
as
quesnay
sees
it
consists
of
three
classes
the
productive
class
of
agriculturists
the
sterile
class
containing
all
those
who
are
active
outside
the
sphere
of
agriculture
industry
commerce
and
the
liberal
professions
and
lastly
the
class
of
landowners
including
the
sovereign
and
the
collectors
of
tithes
the
national
aggregate
product
materialises
in
the
hands
of
the
productive
class
as
an
aggregate
of
provisions
and
raw
materials
to
the
value
of
some
million
livres
of
this
sum
millions
represent
the
annual
working
capital
of
agriculture
millions
represent
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
fixed
capital
and
millions
are
the
net
revenue
accruing
to
the
landowners
apart
from
this
total
produce
the
agriculturists
here
conceived
quite
in
capitalist
terms
as
tenant
farmers
have
million
livres
cash
in
hand
circulation
now
takes
place
in
such
a
way
that
the
tenant
class
pay
the
landowners
millions
cash
as
rent
as
the
cost
of
the
previous
period
of
production
for
this
money
the
landowning
class
buy
provisions
from
the
tenants
for
millions
and
industrial
products
from
the
sterile
class
for
the
remaining
millions
the
tenants
in
their
turn
buy
industrial
products
for
the
millions
handed
back
to
them
whereupon
the
sterile
class
buy
agricultural
products
for
the
millions
they
have
in
hand
for
millions
raw
materials
to
replace
their
annual
working
capital
and
provisions
for
the
remaining
millions
thus
the
money
has
in
the
end
returned
to
its
starting
point
the
tenant
class
the
product
is
distributed
among
all
classes
so
that
consumption
is
ensured
for
everyone
at
the
same
time
the
means
of
production
of
the
sterile
as
well
as
of
the
productive
class
have
been
renewed
and
the
landowning
class
has
received
its
revenue
the
prerequisites
of
reproduction
are
all
present
the
conditions
of
circulation
have
all
been
fulfilled
and
reproduction
can
start
again
on
its
regular
course
we
shall
see
later
in
the
course
of
our
investigation
that
this
exposition
though
showing
flashes
of
genius
remains
deficient
and
primitive
in
any
case
we
must
stress
here
that
quesnay
on
the
threshold
of
scientific
economics
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
the
possibility
of
demonstrating
total
social
capital
and
its
reproduction
adam
smith
on
the
other
hand
while
giving
a
more
profound
analysis
of
the
relations
of
capital
laid
out
what
seems
like
a
maze
when
compared
with
the
clear
and
sweeping
outlines
of
the
physiocrat
conception
by
his
wrong
analysis
of
prices
smith
upset
the
whole
foundation
of
the
scientific
demonstration
of
the
capitalist
process
as
a
whole
this
wrong
analysis
of
prices
ruled
bourgeois
economics
for
a
long
time
it
is
the
theory
which
maintains
that
although
the
value
of
a
commodity
represents
the
amount
of
labour
spent
in
its
production
yet
the
price
consists
of
three
elements
only
the
wage
of
labour
the
profit
of
capital
and
the
rent
as
this
obviously
must
also
apply
to
the
aggregate
of
commodities
the
national
product
we
are
faced
with
the
startling
discovery
that
although
the
value
of
the
aggregate
of
commodities
manufactured
by
capitalist
methods
represents
all
paid
wages
together
with
the
profits
of
capital
and
the
rents
that
is
the
aggregate
surplus
value
and
consequently
can
replace
these
there
is
no
component
of
value
which
corresponds
to
the
constant
capital
used
in
production
according
to
smith
is
the
formula
expressing
the
value
of
the
capitalist
product
as
a
whole
demonstrating
his
view
with
the
example
of
corn
smith
says
as
follows
these
three
parts
wages
profit
and
rent
seem
either
immediately
or
ultimately
to
make
up
the
whole
price
of
corn
a
fourth
part
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
is
necessary
for
replacing
the
stock
of
the
farmer
or
for
compensating
the
wear
and
tear
of
his
labouring
cattle
and
other
instruments
of
husbandry
but
it
must
be
considered
that
the
price
of
any
instrument
of
husbandry
such
as
a
labouring
horse
is
itself
made
up
of
the
same
three
parts
the
rent
of
the
land
upon
which
he
is
reared
the
labour
of
tending
and
rearing
him
and
the
profits
of
the
farmer
who
advances
both
the
rent
of
this
land
and
the
wages
of
this
labour
though
the
price
of
the
corn
therefore
may
pay
the
price
as
well
as
the
maintenance
of
the
horse
the
whole
price
still
resolves
itself
either
immediately
or
ultimately
into
the
same
three
parts
of
rent
of
labour
and
profit
sending
us
in
this
manner
pillar
to
post
as
marx
has
put
it
smith
again
and
again
resolved
constant
capital
into
however
he
had
occasional
doubts
and
from
time
to
time
relapsed
into
the
contrary
opinion
he
says
in
the
second
book
has
been
shown
in
the
first
book
that
the
price
of
the
greater
part
of
commodities
resolves
itself
into
three
parts
of
which
one
pays
the
wages
of
the
labour
another
the
profits
of
the
stock
and
a
third
the
rent
of
the
land
which
had
been
employed
in
producing
and
bringing
them
to
market
since
this
is
the
case
with
regard
to
every
particular
commodity
taken
separately
it
must
be
so
with
regard
to
all
the
commodities
which
compose
the
whole
annual
produce
of
the
land
and
labour
of
every
country
taken
complexly
the
whole
price
or
exchangeable
value
of
that
annual
produce
must
resolve
itself
into
the
same
three
parts
and
be
parcelled
out
among
the
different
inhabitants
of
the
country
either
as
the
wages
of
their
labour
the
profits
of
their
stock
or
the
rent
of
their
land
here
smith
hesitates
and
immediately
below
explains
though
the
whole
value
of
the
annual
produce
of
the
land
and
labour
of
every
country
is
thus
divided
among
and
constitutes
a
revenue
to
its
different
inhabitants
yet
as
in
the
rent
of
a
private
estate
we
distinguish
between
the
gross
rent
and
the
neat
rent
so
may
we
likewise
in
the
revenue
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
great
country
gross
rent
of
a
private
estate
comprehends
whatever
is
paid
by
the
farmer
the
neat
rent
what
remains
free
to
the
landlord
after
deducting
the
expense
of
management
of
repairs
and
all
other
necessary
charges
or
what
without
hurting
his
estate
he
can
afford
to
place
in
his
stock
reserved
for
immediate
consumption
or
to
spend
upon
his
table
equipage
the
ornaments
of
his
house
and
furniture
his
private
enjoyments
and
amusements
his
real
wealth
is
in
proportion
not
to
his
gross
but
to
his
neat
rent
gross
revenue
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
great
country
comprehends
the
whole
annual
produce
of
their
land
and
labour
the
neat
revenue
what
remains
free
to
them
after
deducting
the
expense
of
maintaining
first
their
fixed
and
secondly
their
circulating
capital
or
what
without
encroaching
upon
their
capital
they
can
place
in
their
stock
reserved
for
immediate
consumption
or
spend
upon
their
subsistence
conveniences
and
amusements
their
real
wealth
too
is
in
proportion
not
to
their
gross
but
to
their
neat
revenue
here
smith
introduces
a
portion
of
value
which
corresponds
to
constant
capital
only
to
eliminate
it
the
very
next
moment
by
resolving
it
into
wages
profits
and
rents
and
in
the
end
the
matter
rests
with
this
explanation
the
machines
and
instruments
of
trade
etc
which
compose
the
fixed
capital
either
of
an
individual
or
of
a
society
make
no
part
either
of
the
gross
or
the
neat
revenue
of
either
so
money
by
means
of
which
the
whole
revenue
of
the
society
is
regularly
distributed
among
all
its
different
members
makes
itself
no
part
of
that
revenue
constant
capital
the
fixed
capital
of
adam
smith
is
thus
put
on
the
same
level
as
money
and
does
not
enter
into
the
total
produce
of
society
its
gross
revenue
it
does
not
exist
within
this
total
product
as
an
element
of
value
you
can
not
get
blood
out
of
a
stone
and
so
circulation
the
mutual
exchange
of
the
total
product
constituted
in
this
manner
can
only
lead
to
realisation
of
the
wages
and
of
the
surplus
value
however
as
it
can
not
by
any
means
replace
the
constant
capital
continued
reproduction
evidently
must
become
impossible
smith
indeed
knew
quite
well
and
did
not
dream
of
denying
that
every
individual
capitalist
requires
constant
capital
in
addition
to
his
wages
fund
his
variable
capital
in
order
to
run
his
enterprise
yet
the
above
analysis
of
commodity
prices
when
it
comes
to
take
note
of
capitalist
production
as
a
whole
allows
constant
capital
to
disappear
without
a
trace
in
a
puzzling
way
thus
the
problem
of
the
reproduction
of
capital
is
completely
muddled
up
it
is
plain
that
if
the
most
elementary
premise
of
the
problem
the
demonstration
of
social
capital
as
a
whole
were
on
the
rocks
the
whole
analysis
was
bound
to
fail
ricardo
say
sismondi
and
others
took
up
this
erroneous
theory
of
adam
smith
and
they
all
stumbled
in
their
observations
on
the
problem
of
reproduction
over
this
most
elementary
difficulty
the
demonstration
of
social
capital
another
difficulty
is
mixed
up
with
the
foregoing
from
the
very
outset
of
scientific
analysis
what
is
the
nature
of
the
total
capital
of
a
society
as
regards
the
individual
producer
the
position
is
clear
his
capital
consists
of
the
expenses
of
his
enterprise
assuming
capitalist
methods
of
production
the
value
of
his
product
yields
him
a
surplus
over
and
above
his
expenses
that
surplus
value
which
does
not
replace
his
capital
but
constitutes
his
net
income
which
he
can
consume
completely
without
encroaching
upon
his
capital
and
which
is
thus
his
fund
of
consumption
it
is
true
that
the
capitalist
may
save
part
of
this
net
income
not
consuming
it
himself
but
adding
it
to
his
capital
but
that
is
another
matter
a
new
step
the
formation
of
a
new
capital
which
again
must
be
replaced
by
subsequent
reproduction
and
must
again
yield
him
a
surplus
in
any
case
the
capital
of
an
individual
always
consists
of
what
he
requires
for
production
together
with
his
advances
on
the
running
of
his
enterprise
and
his
income
is
what
he
himself
actually
consumes
or
may
consume
his
fund
of
consumption
if
we
ask
a
capitalist
are
the
wages
you
pay
your
workers
his
answer
will
be
are
obviously
part
of
my
working
capital
but
if
we
ask
are
these
wages
for
the
workers
who
have
received
them
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
describe
them
as
capital
for
wages
received
are
not
capital
for
the
workers
but
income
their
fund
of
consumption
let
us
now
take
another
example
a
manufacturer
of
machinery
produces
machines
in
his
factory
the
annual
output
is
a
certain
number
of
machines
in
its
value
however
this
annual
output
contains
the
capital
advanced
by
the
manufacturer
as
well
as
the
net
income
that
has
been
earned
part
of
the
manufactured
machines
thus
represent
income
for
the
manufacturer
and
are
destined
to
realise
this
income
in
the
process
of
circulation
and
exchange
but
the
person
who
buys
these
machines
from
the
manufacturer
does
not
buy
them
as
income
but
in
order
to
use
them
as
a
means
of
production
for
him
they
are
capital
these
examples
make
it
seem
plausible
that
an
object
which
is
capital
for
one
person
may
be
income
for
another
and
how
can
it
be
possible
under
these
circumstances
to
construct
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
total
capital
of
society
indeed
almost
every
scientific
economist
up
to
the
time
of
marx
concluded
that
there
is
no
social
capital
smith
was
still
doubtful
undecided
vacillating
about
this
question
so
was
ricardo
but
already
say
declared
categorically
is
in
this
way
that
the
total
value
of
products
is
distributed
amongst
the
members
of
the
community
i
say
the
value
because
such
part
of
the
whole
value
produced
as
does
not
go
to
one
of
the
consuming
producers
is
received
by
the
rest
the
clothier
buys
wool
of
the
farmer
pays
his
workmen
in
every
department
and
sells
the
cloth
the
result
of
their
united
exertion
at
a
price
that
reimburses
all
his
advances
and
affords
himself
a
profit
he
never
reckons
as
profit
or
as
the
revenue
of
his
own
industry
anything
more
than
the
surplus
after
deducting
all
charges
and
outgoings
but
those
outgoings
are
merely
an
advance
of
their
respective
revenues
to
the
previous
producers
which
are
refunded
by
the
value
of
the
cloth
the
price
paid
to
the
farmer
for
his
wool
is
the
compound
of
the
several
revenues
of
the
cultivator
the
shepherd
and
the
landlord
although
the
farmer
reckons
as
produce
only
the
surplus
remaining
after
payment
of
his
landlord
and
his
servants
in
husbandry
yet
to
them
these
payments
are
items
of
revenue
rent
to
the
one
and
wages
to
the
other
to
the
one
the
revenue
of
the
land
to
the
other
the
revenue
of
his
industry
the
aggregate
of
all
these
is
defrayed
out
of
the
value
of
the
cloth
the
whole
of
which
forms
the
revenue
of
some
one
or
other
and
is
entirely
absorbed
in
that
whence
it
appears
that
the
term
produce
applies
only
to
the
individual
revenue
of
each
separate
producer
or
adventurer
in
industry
but
that
the
aggregate
of
individual
revenue
the
total
revenue
of
the
community
is
equal
to
the
produce
of
its
land
capital
and
industry
which
entirely
subverts
the
system
of
the
economists
of
the
last
century
who
considered
nothing
but
the
net
produce
of
the
land
as
farming
revenue
and
therefore
concluded
that
this
net
produce
was
all
that
the
community
had
to
consume
instead
of
closing
with
the
obvious
inference
that
the
whole
of
what
had
been
created
may
also
be
consumed
by
mankind
say
proves
his
theory
in
his
own
peculiar
fashion
whereas
adam
smith
tried
to
give
a
proof
by
referring
each
private
capital
unit
to
its
place
of
production
in
order
to
resolve
it
into
a
mere
product
of
labour
but
conceived
of
every
product
of
labour
in
strictly
capitalist
terms
as
a
sum
of
paid
and
unpaid
labour
as
and
thus
came
to
resolve
the
total
product
of
society
into
say
of
course
is
cocksure
enough
to
these
classical
errors
by
inflating
them
into
common
vulgarities
his
argument
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
entrepreneur
at
every
stage
of
production
pays
other
people
the
representatives
of
previous
stages
of
production
for
the
means
of
production
which
are
capital
for
him
and
that
these
people
in
their
turn
put
part
of
this
payment
into
their
own
pockets
as
their
income
and
partly
use
it
to
recoup
themselves
for
expenses
advanced
in
order
to
provide
yet
another
set
of
people
with
an
income
say
converts
adam
smith
endless
chain
of
labour
processes
into
an
equally
unending
chain
of
mutual
advances
on
income
and
their
repayment
from
the
proceeds
of
sales
the
worker
appears
here
as
the
absolute
equal
of
the
entrepreneur
he
has
his
income
advanced
in
the
form
of
wages
paying
for
it
in
turn
by
the
labour
he
performs
thus
the
final
value
of
the
aggregate
social
product
appears
as
the
sum
of
a
large
number
of
advanced
incomes
and
is
spent
in
the
process
of
exchange
on
repayment
of
all
these
advances
it
is
characteristic
of
say
superficiality
that
he
illustrates
the
social
connections
of
capitalist
reproduction
by
the
example
of
watch
manufacture
a
branch
of
production
which
at
that
time
and
partly
even
is
pure
where
every
worker
is
also
an
entrepreneur
on
a
small
scale
and
the
process
of
production
of
surplus
value
is
masked
by
a
series
of
successive
acts
of
exchange
typical
of
simple
commodity
production
thus
say
gives
an
extremely
crude
expression
to
the
confusion
inaugurated
by
adam
smith
the
aggregate
of
annual
social
produce
can
be
completely
resolved
as
regards
its
value
into
a
sequence
of
various
incomes
therefore
it
is
completely
consumed
every
year
it
remains
an
enigma
how
production
can
be
taken
up
again
without
capital
and
means
of
production
and
capitalist
reproduction
appears
to
be
an
insoluble
problem
if
we
compare
the
varying
approaches
to
the
problem
from
the
time
of
the
physiocrats
to
that
of
adam
smith
we
can
not
fail
to
recognise
partial
progress
as
well
as
partial
regression
the
main
characteristic
of
the
economic
conception
of
the
physiocrats
was
their
assumption
that
agriculture
alone
creates
a
surplus
that
is
surplus
value
and
that
agricultural
labour
is
the
only
kind
of
labour
which
is
productive
in
the
capitalist
sense
of
the
term
consequently
we
see
in
the
that
the
unproductive
class
of
industrial
workers
creates
value
only
to
the
extent
of
the
same
million
livres
which
it
consumes
as
raw
materials
and
foodstuffs
consequently
too
in
the
process
of
exchange
the
total
of
manufactured
products
is
divided
into
two
parts
one
of
which
goes
to
the
tenant
class
and
the
other
to
the
landowning
class
while
the
manufacturing
class
does
not
consume
its
own
products
thus
in
the
value
of
its
commodities
the
manufacturing
class
reproduces
strictly
speaking
only
that
circulating
capital
which
has
been
consumed
and
no
income
is
created
for
the
class
of
entrepreneurs
the
only
income
of
society
that
comes
into
circulation
in
excess
of
all
capital
advances
is
created
in
agriculture
and
is
consumed
by
the
landowning
class
in
the
form
of
rents
while
even
the
tenant
class
do
no
more
than
replace
their
capital
to
wit
million
livres
interest
from
the
fixed
capital
and
million
circulating
capital
being
raw
materials
and
foodstuffs
and
industrial
products
further
it
is
striking
that
it
is
in
agriculture
alone
that
quesnay
assumes
the
existence
of
fixed
capital
which
he
calls
as
distinct
from
industry
as
he
sees
it
apparently
works
without
any
fixed
capital
only
with
circulating
capital
turned
over
each
year
and
consequently
does
not
create
in
its
annual
output
of
commodities
any
element
of
value
for
making
good
the
wear
and
tear
of
fixed
capital
such
as
premises
tools
and
so
on
in
contrast
with
this
obvious
defect
the
english
classical
school
shows
a
decisive
advance
above
all
in
proclaiming
every
kind
of
labour
as
productive
thus
revealing
the
creation
of
surplus
value
in
manufacture
as
well
as
in
agriculture
we
say
the
english
classical
school
because
on
this
point
adam
smith
himself
occasionally
relapses
quietly
into
the
physiocrat
point
of
view
it
is
only
ricardo
who
develops
the
theory
of
the
value
of
labour
as
highly
and
logically
as
it
could
advance
within
the
limits
of
the
bourgeois
approach
the
consequence
is
that
we
must
assume
all
capital
investment
to
produce
annual
surplus
value
in
the
manufacturing
part
of
social
production
as
a
whole
no
less
than
in
agriculture
on
the
other
hand
the
discovery
of
the
productive
property
of
every
kind
of
labour
alike
in
agriculture
and
in
manufacture
suggested
to
smith
that
agricultural
labour
too
must
produce
apart
from
the
rent
for
the
landowning
class
a
surplus
for
the
tenant
class
over
and
above
the
total
of
their
capital
expenses
thus
in
addition
to
the
replacement
of
capital
an
annual
income
of
the
tenant
class
comes
into
being
lastly
by
a
systematic
elaboration
of
the
concepts
of
and
introduced
by
quesnay
which
he
calls
fixed
and
circulating
capital
smith
has
made
clear
among
other
things
that
the
manufacturing
side
of
social
production
requires
a
fixed
as
well
as
a
circulating
capital
thus
he
was
well
on
the
way
to
restoring
to
order
the
concepts
of
capital
and
revenue
of
society
and
to
describing
them
in
precise
terms
the
following
exposition
represents
the
highest
level
of
clarity
which
he
achieved
in
this
respect
the
whole
annual
produce
of
the
land
and
labour
of
every
country
is
no
doubt
ultimately
destined
for
supplying
the
consumption
of
its
inhabitants
and
for
procuring
a
revenue
to
them
yet
when
it
first
comes
either
from
the
ground
or
from
the
hands
of
the
productive
labourer
it
naturally
divides
itself
into
two
parts
one
of
them
and
frequently
the
largest
is
in
the
first
place
destined
for
replacing
a
capital
or
for
renewing
the
provisions
materials
and
finished
work
which
had
been
withdrawn
from
a
capital
the
other
for
constituting
a
revenue
either
to
the
owner
of
this
capital
as
the
profit
of
his
stock
or
to
some
other
person
as
the
rent
of
his
land
gross
revenue
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
great
country
comprehends
the
whole
annual
produce
of
their
land
and
labour
the
neat
revenue
what
remains
free
to
them
after
deducting
the
expense
of
maintaining
first
their
fixed
and
secondly
their
circulating
capital
or
what
without
encroaching
upon
their
capital
they
can
place
in
their
stock
reserved
for
immediate
consumption
or
spend
upon
their
subsistence
conveniencies
and
amusements
their
real
wealth
too
is
in
proportion
not
to
their
gross
but
to
their
neat
revenue
the
concepts
of
total
capital
and
income
appear
here
in
a
more
comprehensive
and
stricter
form
than
in
the
the
connection
of
social
income
with
agriculture
is
severed
and
social
income
becomes
a
broader
concept
and
a
broader
concept
of
capital
in
its
two
forms
fixed
and
circulating
capital
is
made
the
basis
of
social
production
as
a
whole
instead
of
the
misleading
differentiation
of
production
into
two
departments
agriculture
and
industry
other
categories
of
real
importance
are
here
brought
to
the
fore
the
distinction
between
capital
and
income
and
the
distinction
further
between
fixed
and
circulating
capital
now
smith
proceeds
to
a
further
analysis
of
the
mutual
relations
of
these
categories
and
of
how
they
change
in
the
course
of
the
social
process
in
production
and
circulation
in
the
reproductive
process
of
society
he
emphasises
here
a
radical
distinction
between
fixed
and
circulating
capital
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
society
whole
expense
of
maintaining
the
fixed
capital
must
evidently
be
excluded
from
the
neat
revenue
of
the
society
neither
the
materials
necessary
for
supporting
their
useful
machines
and
instruments
of
trade
their
profitable
buildings
nor
the
produce
of
the
labour
necessary
for
fashioning
those
materials
into
the
proper
form
can
ever
make
any
part
of
it
the
price
of
that
labour
may
indeed
make
a
part
of
it
as
the
workmen
so
employed
may
place
the
whole
value
of
their
wages
in
their
stock
reserved
for
immediate
consumption
but
in
other
sorts
of
labour
both
the
price
and
the
produce
go
to
this
stock
the
price
to
that
of
the
workmen
the
produce
to
that
of
other
people
whose
subsistence
convenience
and
amusements
are
augmented
by
the
labour
of
those
workmen
here
smith
comes
up
against
the
important
distinction
between
workers
who
produce
means
of
production
and
those
who
produce
consumer
goods
with
regard
to
the
former
he
remarks
that
they
create
the
value
destined
to
replace
their
wages
and
to
serve
as
their
income
in
the
form
of
means
of
production
such
as
raw
materials
and
instruments
which
in
their
natural
form
can
not
be
consumed
with
regard
to
the
latter
category
of
workers
smith
observes
that
conversely
the
total
product
or
better
that
part
of
value
contained
in
it
which
replaces
the
wages
the
income
of
the
workers
together
with
its
other
remaining
value
appears
here
in
the
form
of
consumer
goods
the
real
meaning
latent
in
this
conclusion
though
smith
does
not
say
so
explicitly
is
that
the
part
of
the
product
which
represents
the
fixed
capital
employed
in
its
production
appears
likewise
in
this
form
in
the
further
course
of
our
investigation
we
shall
see
how
close
smith
has
here
come
to
the
vantage
point
from
which
marx
tackled
the
problem
the
general
conclusion
however
maintained
by
smith
without
any
further
examination
of
the
fundamental
question
is
that
in
any
case
whatever
is
destined
for
the
preservation
and
renewal
of
the
fixed
capital
of
society
can
not
be
added
to
society
net
income
the
position
is
different
with
regard
to
circulating
capital
though
the
whole
expenses
of
maintaining
the
fixed
capital
is
thus
necessarily
excluded
from
the
neat
revenue
of
the
society
it
is
not
the
same
case
with
that
of
maintaining
the
circulating
capital
of
the
four
parts
of
which
this
latter
capital
is
composed
money
provisions
materials
and
finished
work
the
three
last
it
has
already
been
observed
are
regularly
withdrawn
from
it
and
placed
either
in
the
fixed
capital
of
the
society
or
in
their
stock
reserved
for
immediate
consumption
whatever
portion
of
those
consumable
goods
is
not
employed
in
maintaining
the
former
goes
all
to
the
latter
and
makes
a
part
of
the
neat
revenue
of
the
society
besides
what
is
necessary
for
maintaining
the
fixed
capital
we
see
that
smith
here
simply
includes
in
this
category
of
circulating
capital
everything
but
the
fixed
capital
already
employed
that
is
to
say
foodstuffs
and
raw
materials
and
in
part
commodities
which
according
to
their
natural
form
belong
to
the
replacement
of
fixed
capital
thus
he
has
made
the
concept
of
circulating
capital
vague
and
ambiguous
but
a
further
and
most
important
distinction
crops
up
and
cuts
right
through
this
conception
circulating
capital
of
a
society
is
in
this
respect
different
from
that
of
an
individual
that
of
an
individual
is
totally
excluded
from
making
any
part
of
his
neat
revenue
which
must
consist
altogether
in
his
profits
but
though
the
circulating
capital
of
every
individual
makes
a
part
of
that
of
the
society
to
which
he
belongs
it
is
not
upon
that
account
totally
excluded
from
making
a
part
likewise
of
their
neat
revenues
in
the
following
illustration
smith
expounds
what
he
means
the
whole
goods
in
a
merchant
shop
must
by
no
means
be
placed
in
his
own
stock
reserved
for
immediate
consumption
they
may
in
that
of
other
people
who
from
a
revenue
derived
from
other
funds
may
regularly
replace
their
value
to
him
together
with
its
profits
without
occasioning
any
diminution
either
of
his
capital
or
theirs
here
smith
has
established
fundamental
categories
with
regard
to
the
reproduction
and
movement
of
circulating
social
capital
fixed
and
circulating
capital
private
and
social
capital
private
and
social
revenue
means
of
production
and
consumer
goods
are
marked
out
as
comprehensive
categories
and
their
real
objective
interrelation
is
partly
indicated
and
partly
drowned
in
the
subjective
and
theoretical
contradictions
of
smith
analysis
the
concise
strict
and
classically
clear
scheme
of
the
physiocrat
theory
is
dissolved
here
into
a
disorderly
jumble
of
concepts
and
relations
which
at
first
glance
appears
an
absolute
chaos
but
we
may
already
perceive
new
connections
within
the
social
process
of
reproduction
understood
by
smith
in
a
deeper
more
modern
and
vital
way
than
was
within
quesnay
grasp
though
like
michelangelo
slave
in
the
unhewn
block
of
marble
they
are
still
inchoate
this
is
the
only
illustration
smith
gives
of
this
problem
but
at
the
same
time
he
attacks
it
from
another
angle
by
an
analysis
of
value
this
very
same
theory
which
represents
an
advance
beyond
the
physiocrats
the
theory
that
it
is
an
essential
quality
of
all
labour
to
create
value
the
strictly
capitalist
distinction
between
paid
labour
replacing
wages
and
unpaid
labour
creating
surplus
value
and
finally
the
strict
division
of
surplus
value
into
its
two
main
categories
of
profit
and
rent
all
this
progress
from
the
analysis
of
the
physiocrats
leads
smith
to
the
strange
proposition
that
the
price
of
every
commodity
consists
of
wages
plus
profits
plus
rent
or
in
marx
shorthand
of
in
consequence
the
commodities
annually
produced
by
society
as
a
whole
can
be
resolved
completely
as
to
value
into
the
two
components
wages
and
surplus
value
here
the
category
of
capital
has
disappeared
all
of
a
sudden
society
produces
nothing
but
income
nothing
but
consumer
goods
which
it
also
consumes
completely
reproduction
without
capital
becomes
a
paradox
and
the
treatment
of
the
problem
as
a
whole
has
taken
an
immense
backward
step
against
that
of
the
physiocrats
the
followers
of
adam
smith
have
tackled
this
twofold
theory
from
precisely
the
wrong
approach
before
marx
nobody
concerned
himself
with
the
important
beginnings
of
an
exact
exposition
of
the
problem
in
smith

book
while
most
of
his
followers
jealously
preserved
smith
radically
wrong
analysis
of
prices
accepting
it
like
ricardo
without
question
or
else
like
say
elaborating
it
into
a
trite
doctrine
where
smith
raised
fruitful
doubts
and
stimulating
contradictions
say
flaunted
the
opinionated
presumption
of
a
commonplace
mind
smith
observation
that
the
capital
of
one
person
may
be
the
revenue
of
another
induced
say
to
proclaim
every
distinction
between
capital
and
income
on
the
social
scale
to
be
absurd
the
absurdity
however
that
income
should
completely
absorb
the
total
value
of
annual
production
which
is
thus
consumed
completely
assumes
in
say
treatment
the
character
of
an
absolutely
valid
dogma
if
society
annually
consumes
its
own
total
product
completely
social
reproduction
without
any
means
of
production
whatever
must
become
an
annual
repetition
of
the
miracle
of
the
creation
in
this
state
the
problem
of
reproduction
remained
up
to
the

how
the
result
of

production
in

value
which
the

add
to

therefore
resolves
itself
in

into
two
parts

which
the
one

a
criticism
of
smith
analysis
let
us
recapitulate
the
conclusions
to
which
smith
analysis
has
brought
us
there
is
a
fixed
capital
of
society
no
part
of
which
enters
into
its
net
revenue
this
fixed
capital
consists
in
materials
necessary
for
supporting
their
useful
machines
and
instruments
of
trade
and
produce
of
labour
necessary
for
fashioning
those
materials
into
the
proper
form
by
singling
out
the
production
of
such
fixed
capital
as
of
a
special
kind
and
explicitly
contrasting
it
with
the
production
of
consumer
goods
smith
in
effect
transformed
fixed
capital
into
what
marx
calls
capital
that
part
of
capital
which
consists
of
all
material
means
of
production
as
opposed
to
labour
power
there
is
a
circulating
capital
of
society
after
eliminating
the
part
of
fixed
or
constant
capital
there
remains
only
the
category
of
consumer
goods
these
are
not
capital
for
society
but
net
revenue
a
fund
of
consumption
capital
and
net
revenue
of
an
individual
do
not
strictly
correspond
with
capital
and
net
revenue
of
society
what
is
nothing
but
fixed
or
constant
capital
for
society
as
a
whole
can
not
be
capital
for
the
individual
it
must
be
revenue
too
a
fund
of
consumption
comprising
as
it
does
those
parts
of
fixed
capital
which
represent
the
wages
and
the
capitalists
profits
on
the
other
hand
the
circulating
capital
of
the
individuals
can
not
be
capital
for
society
but
must
be
revenue
especially
in
so
far
as
it
takes
the
form
of
provisions
as
regards
the
value
of
the
total
annual
social
product
no
trace
of
capital
remains
it
can
be
resolved
completely
into
the
three
kinds
of
income
wages
profits
of
capital
and
rents
if
we
tried
from
this
haphazard
collection
of
odd
ideas
to
build
up
a
picture
of
the
annual
reproduction
of
total
social
capital
and
of
its
mechanism
we
should
soon
despair
of
our
task
indeed
all
these
observations
leave
us
infinitely
remote
from
the
solution
of
the
problem
how
social
capital
is
annually
renewed
how
everybody
consumption
is
ensured
by
his
income
while
the
individuals
can
nevertheless
adhere
to
their
own
points
of
view
on
capital
and
income
yet
if
we
wish
to
appreciate
fully
marx
contribution
to
the
elucidation
of
this
problem
we
must
be
fully
aware
of
all
this
confusion
of
ideas
the
mass
of
conflicting
points
of
view
let
us
begin
with
adam
smith
last
thesis
which
alone
would
suffice
to
wreck
the
treatment
of
the
problem
of
reproduction
in
classical
economics
smith
basic
principle
is
that
the
total
produce
of
society
when
we
consider
its
value
resolves
itself
completely
into
wages
profits
and
rents
this
conception
is
deeply
rooted
in
his
scientific
theory
that
value
is
nothing
but
the
product
of
labour
all
labour
performed
however
is
wage
labour
this
identification
of
human
labour
with
capitalist
wage
labour
is
indeed
the
classical
element
in
doctrine
the
value
of
the
aggregate
product
of
society
comprises
both
the
recompense
for
wages
advanced
and
a
surplus
from
unpaid
labour
appearing
as
profit
for
the
capitalist
and
rent
for
the
landowner
what
holds
good
for
the
individual
commodity
must
hold
good
equally
for
the
aggregate
of
commodities
the
whole
mass
of
commodities
produced
by
society
taken
as
a
quantity
of
value
is
nothing
but
a
product
of
labour
of
paid
as
well
as
unpaid
labour
and
thus
it
is
also
to
be
completely
resolved
into
wages
profits
and
rents
it
is
of
course
true
that
raw
materials
instruments
and
the
like
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
connection
with
all
labour
yet
is
it
not
true
also
that
these
raw
materials
and
instruments
in
their
turn
are
equally
products
of
labour
which
again
may
have
been
paid
or
unpaid
we
may
go
back
as
far
as
we
choose
we
may
twist
and
turn
the
problem
as
much
as
we
like
yet
we
shall
find
no
element
in
the
value
of
any
commodity
and
therefore
none
in
the
price
which
can
not
be
resolved
purely
in
terms
of
human
labour
we
can
distinguish
however
two
parts
in
all
labour
one
part
repays
the
wages
and
the
other
accrues
to
the
capitalist
and
landlord
there
seems
nothing
left
but
wages
and
profits
and
yet
there
is
capital
individual
and
social
capital
how
can
we
overcome
this
blatant
contradiction
the
fact
that
marx
himself
stubbornly
pursued
this
matter
for
a
long
time
without
getting
anywhere
at
first
as
witness
his
of
the
surplus
proves
that
this
theoretical
problem
is
indeed
extremely
hard
to
solve
yet
the
solution
he
eventually
hit
on
was
strikingly
successful
and
it
is
based
upon
his
theory
of
value
adam
smith
was
perfectly
right
nothing
but
labour
constitutes
the
value
of
the
individual
commodity
and
of
the
aggregate
of
commodities
he
was
equally
right
in
saying
that
from
a
capitalist
point
of
view
all
labour
is
either
paid
labour
which
restores
the
wages
or
unpaid
labour
which
as
surplus
value
accrues
to
the
various
classes
owning
the
means
of
production
what
he
forgot
however
or
rather
overlooked
is
the
fact
that
apart
from
being
able
to
create
new
value
labour
can
also
transfer
to
the
new
commodities
the
old
values
incorporated
in
the
means
of
production
employed
a
working
day
of
ten
hours
is
from
the
capitalist
point
of
view
divided
into
paid
and
unpaid
hours
into
but
the
commodity
produced
in
these
ten
hours
will
represent
a
greater
value
than
that
of
ten
labour
for
it
will
also
contain
the
value
of
the
flour
of
the
oven
which
is
used
of
the
premises
of
the
fuel
and
so
on
in
short
the
value
of
all
the
means
of
production
necessary
for
baking
under
one
condition
alone
could
the
value
of
any
one
commodity
be
strictly
equal
to
if
a
man
were
to
work
in
without
raw
materials
without
tools
or
workshop
but
since
all
work
on
materials
material
labour
presupposes
means
of
production
of
some
sort
which
themselves
result
from
preceding
labour
the
value
of
this
past
labour
is
of
necessity
transferred
to
the
new
product
the
process
in
question
does
not
only
take
place
in
capitalist
production
it
is
the
general
foundation
of
human
labour
quite
independent
of
the
historical
form
of
society
the
handling
of
tools
is
a
fundamental
characteristic
of
human
civilisation
the
concept
of
past
labour
which
precedes
all
new
labour
and
prepares
its
basis
expresses
the
nexus
between
man
and
nature
evolved
in
the
history
of
civilisation
this
is
the
eternal
chain
of
closely
interwoven
labouring
efforts
of
human
society
the
beginnings
of
which
are
lost
in
the
grey
dawn
of
the
socialisation
of
mankind
and
the
termination
of
which
would
imply
the
end
of
the
whole
of
civilised
mankind
therefore
we
have
to
picture
all
human
labour
as
performed
with
the
help
of
tools
which
themselves
are
already
products
of
antecedent
labour
every
new
product
thus
contains
not
only
the
new
labour
whereby
it
is
given
its
final
form
but
also
past
labour
which
had
supplied
the
materials
for
it
the
instruments
of
labour
and
so
forth
in
the
production
of
value
that
is
commodity
production
into
which
capitalist
production
also
enters
this
phenomenon
is
not
suspended
it
only
receives
a
particular
expression
here
the
labour
which
produces
commodities
assumes
a
twofold
characteristic
it
is
on
the
one
hand
useful
concrete
labour
of
some
kind
or
other
creating
the
useful
object
the
on
the
other
hand
it
is
abstract
general
socially
necessary
labour
and
as
such
creates
value
in
its
first
aspect
it
does
what
labour
has
always
done
it
transfers
to
the
new
product
past
labour
incorporated
in
the
means
of
production
employed
with
this
distinction
only
that
this
past
labour
too
now
appears
as
value
as
old
value
in
its
second
aspect
labour
creates
new
value
which
in
capitalist
terms
can
be
reduced
to
paid
and
unpaid
labour
to
thus
the
value
of
every
commodity
must
contain
old
value
which
has
been
transferred
by
labour
useful
concrete
labour
from
the
means
of
production
to
the
commodity
as
well
as
the
new
value
created
by
the
same
labour
socially
necessary
labour
merely
as
this
labour
is
expended
hour
by
hour
this
distinction
was
beyond
smith
he
did
not
differentiate
the
twofold
character
of
labour
marx
once
claimed
to
have
discovered
the
ultimate
source
of
smith
strange
dogma
that
the
aggregate
of
produced
values
can
be
completely
resolved
into
in
his
fundamentally
erroneous
theory
of
value
failure
to
differentiate
between
the
two
aspects
of
labour
as
concrete
and
useful
labour
on
the
one
hand
and
abstract
and
socially
necessary
labour
on
the
other
indeed
forms
one
of
the
most
important
characteristics
of
the
theory
of
value
as
conceived
not
only
by
smith
but
by
all
members
of
the
classical
school
disregarding
all
social
consequences
classical
economics
recognised
that
human
labour
alone
is
the
factor
which
creates
value
and
it
worked
out
this
theory
to
that
degree
of
clarity
which
we
meet
in
formulation
there
is
a
fundamental
distinction
however
between
marx
theory
of
value
and
ricardo
a
distinction
which
has
been
misunderstood
not
only
by
bourgeois
economists
but
also
in
most
cases
by
the
popularisers
of
marx
doctrine
ricardo
conceiving
as
he
did
of
bourgeois
economy
in
terms
of
natural
law
believed
also
that
the
creation
of
value
too
is
a
natural
property
of
human
labour
of
the
specific
and
concrete
labour
of
the
individual
human
being
this
view
is
even
more
blatantly
revealed
in
the
writings
of
adam
smith
who
for
instance
declares
what
he
calls
the
to
exchange
to
be
a
quality
peculiar
to
human
nature
having
looked
for
it
in
vain
in
animals
particularly
in
dogs
and
although
he
doubted
the
existence
of
the
propensity
to
exchange
in
animals
smith
attributed
to
animal
as
well
as
human
labour
the
faculty
of
creating
value
especially
when
he
occasionally
relapses
into
the
physiocrat
doctrine
equal
capital
puts
into
motion
a
greater
quantity
of
productive
labour
than
that
of
the
farmer
not
only
his
labouring
servants
but
his
labouring
cattle
are
productive
labourers
labourers
and
labouring
cattle
therefore
employed
in
agriculture
not
only
occasion
like
the
workmen
in
manufactures
the
reproduction
of
a
value
equal
to
their
own
consumption
or
to
the
capital
which
employs
them
together
with
its
owner
profits
but
of
a
much
greater
value
over
and
above
the
capital
of
the
farmer
and
all
its
profits
they
regularly
occasion
the
reproduction
of
the
rent
of
the
landlord
smith
belief
that
the
creation
of
value
is
a
direct
physiological
property
of
labour
a
manifestation
of
the
animal
organism
in
man
finds
its
most
vivid
expression
here
just
as
the
spider
produces
its
web
from
its
own
body
so
labouring
man
produces
value
labouring
man
pure
and
simple
every
man
who
produces
useful
objects
because
labouring
man
is
by
birth
a
producer
of
commodities
in
the
same
way
human
society
is
founded
by
nature
on
the
exchange
of
commodities
and
a
commodity
economy
is
the
normal
form
of
human
economy
it
was
left
to
marx
to
recognise
that
a
given
value
covers
a
definite
social
relationship
which
develops
under
definite
historical
conditions
thus
he
came
to
discriminate
between
the
two
aspects
of
labour
concrete
individual
labour
and
socially
necessary
labour
when
this
distinction
is
made
the
solution
of
the
money
problem
becomes
clear
also
as
though
a
spotlight
had
been
turned
on
it
marx
had
to
establish
a
dynamic
distinction
in
the
course
of
history
between
the
commodity
producer
and
the
labouring
man
in
order
to
distinguish
the
twin
aspects
of
labour
which
appear
static
in
bourgeois
economy
he
had
to
discover
that
the
production
of
commodities
is
a
definite
historical
form
of
social
production
before
he
could
decipher
the
hieroglyphics
of
capitalist
economy
in
a
word
marx
had
to
approach
the
problem
with
methods
of
deduction
diametrically
opposed
to
those
of
the
classical
school
he
had
in
his
approach
to
renounce
the
faith
in
the
human
and
normal
element
in
bourgeois
production
and
to
recognise
their
historical
transience
he
had
to
reverse
the
metaphysical
deductions
of
the
classics
into
their
opposite
the
dialectical
on
this
showing
smith
could
not
possibly
have
arrived
at
a
clear
distinction
between
the
two
aspects
of
labour
which
on
the
one
hand
transfers
the
old
value
incorporated
in
the
means
of
production
to
the
new
product
and
on
the
other
hand
creates
new
value
at
the
same
time
moreover
there
seems
to
be
yet
another
source
of
his
dogma
that
total
value
can
be
completely
resolved
into
we
should
be
wrong
to
assume
that
smith
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
every
commodity
produced
contains
not
only
the
value
created
by
its
production
but
also
the
values
incorporated
in
all
the
means
of
production
that
had
been
spent
upon
it
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
it
by
the
very
fact
that
he
continually
refers
us
from
one
stage
of
production
to
a
former
one
sending
us
as
marx
complains
from
pillar
to
post
in
order
to
show
the
complete
divisibility
of
the
aggregate
value
into
smith
proves
himself
well
aware
of
the
point
what
is
strange
in
this
connection
is
that
he
again
and
again
resolves
the
old
value
of
the
means
of
production
too
into
so
as
finally
to
cover
the
whole
value
contained
in
the
commodity
the
price
of
corn
for
example
one
part
pays
the
rent
of
the
landlord
another
pays
the
wages
of
maintenance
of
the
labourers
and
labouring
cattle
employed
in
producing
it
and
the
third
pays
the
profit
of
the
farmer
these
three
parts
wages
profit
and
rent
seem
either
immediately
or
ultimately
to
make
up
the
whole
price
of
corn
a
fourth
part
it
may
perhaps
be
thought
is
necessary
for
replacing
the
stock
of
the
farmer
or
for
compensating
the
wear
and
tear
of
his
labouring
cattle
and
other
instruments
of
husbandry
but
it
must
be
considered
that
the
price
of
any
instrument
of
husbandry
such
as
a
labouring
horse
is
itself
made
up
of
the
same
three
parts
the
rent
of
the
land
upon
which
he
is
reared
the
labour
of
tending
and
rearing
him
and
the
profits
of
the
farmer
who
advances
both
the
rent
of
this
land
and
the
wages
of
this
labour
though
the
price
of
the
corn
therefore
may
pay
the
price
as
well
as
the
maintenance
of
the
horse
the
whole
price
still
resolves
itself
either
immediately
or
ultimately
into
the
same
three
parts
of
rent
of
labour
and
profit
apparently
smith
confusion
arose
from
the
following
premises
first
that
all
labour
is
performed
with
the
help
of
means
of
production
of
some
kind
or
other
yet
what
are
these
means
of
production
associated
with
any
given
labour
such
as
raw
materials
and
tools
if
not
the
product
of
previous
labour
flour
is
a
means
of
production
to
which
the
baker
adds
new
labour
yet
flour
is
the
result
of
the
miller
work
and
in
his
hands
it
was
not
a
means
of
production
but
the
very
product
in
the
same
way
as
now
the
bread
and
pastries
are
the
product
of
the
baker
this
product
flour
again
presupposes
grain
as
a
means
of
production
and
if
we
go
one
step
further
back
this
corn
is
not
a
means
of
production
in
the
hands
of
the
farmer
but
the
product
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
means
of
production
in
which
value
is
embodied
without
it
being
itself
the
product
of
some
previous
labour
secondly
speaking
in
terms
of
capitalism
it
follows
further
that
all
capital
which
has
been
completely
used
up
in
the
manufacture
of
any
commodity
can
in
the
end
be
resolved
into
a
certain
quantity
of
performed
labour
thirdly
the
total
value
of
the
commodity
including
all
capital
advances
can
readily
be
resolved
in
this
manner
into
a
certain
quantity
of
labour
what
is
true
for
every
commodity
must
go
also
for
the
aggregate
of
commodities
produced
by
a
society
in
the
course
of
a
year
its
aggregate
value
can
similarly
be
resolved
into
a
quantity
of
performed
labour
fourthly
all
labour
performed
under
capitalist
conditions
is
divided
into
two
parts
paid
labour
which
restores
the
wages
advanced
and
unpaid
labour
which
creates
profit
and
rent
or
surplus
value
all
labour
carried
out
under
capitalist
conditions
thus
corresponds
to
our
formula
all
the
arguments
outlined
above
are
perfectly
correct
and
unassailable
smith
handled
them
in
a
manner
which
proves
his
scientific
analysis
consistent
and
undeviating
and
his
conceptions
of
value
and
surplus
value
a
distinct
advance
on
the
physiocrat
approach
only
occasionally
in
his
third
thesis
he
went
astray
in
his
final
conclusion
saying
that
the
aggregate
value
of
the
annually
produced
aggregate
of
commodities
can
be
resolved
into
the
labour
of
that
very
year
although
he
himself
had
been
acute
enough
to
admit
elsewhere
that
the
value
of
the
commodities
a
nation
produces
in
the
course
of
one
year
necessarily
includes
the
labour
of
former
years
as
well
that
is
the
labour
embodied
in
the
means
of
production
which
have
been
handed
down
but
even
if
the
four
statements
enumerated
are
perfectly
correct
in
themselves
the
conclusion
smith
draws
from
them
that
the
total
value
of
every
commodity
and
equally
of
the
annual
aggregate
of
commodities
in
a
society
can
be
resolved
entirely
into
is
absolutely
wrong
he
has
the
right
idea
that
the
whole
value
of
a
commodity
represents
nothing
but
social
labour
yet
identifies
it
with
a
false
principle
that
all
value
is
nothing
but
the
formula
expresses
the
function
of
living
labour
under
capitalism
or
rather
its
double
function
first
to
restore
the
wages
or
the
variable
capital
and
secondly
to
create
surplus
value
for
the
capitalist
wage
labour
fulfils
this
function
whilst
it
is
employed
by
the
capitalists
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
value
of
the
commodities
is
realised
in
cash
the
capitalist
takes
back
the
variable
capital
he
had
advanced
in
form
of
wages
and
he
pockets
the
surplus
value
as
well
therefore
expresses
the
relation
between
wage
labour
and
capitalist
a
relationship
that
is
terminated
in
every
instance
as
soon
as
the
process
of
commodity
production
is
finished
once
the
commodity
is
sold
and
the
relation
is
realised
for
the
capitalist
in
cash
the
whole
relationship
is
wiped
out
and
leaves
no
traces
on
the
commodity
if
we
examine
the
commodity
and
its
value
we
can
not
ascertain
whether
it
has
been
produced
by
paid
or
by
unpaid
labour
nor
in
what
proportion
these
have
contributed
only
one
fact
is
beyond
doubt
the
commodity
contains
a
certain
quantity
of
socially
necessary
labour
which
is
expressed
in
its
exchange
it
is
completely
immaterial
for
the
act
of
exchange
as
well
as
for
the
use
of
the
commodity
whether
the
labour
which
produced
it
could
be
resolved
into
or
not
in
the
act
of
exchange
all
that
matters
is
that
the
commodity
represents
value
and
only
its
concrete
qualities
its
usefulness
are
relevant
to
the
use
we
make
of
it
thus
the
formula
only
expresses
as
it
were
the
intimate
relationship
between
capital
and
labour
the
social
function
of
wage
labour
and
in
the
actual
product
this
is
completely
wiped
out
it
is
different
with
the
constant
capital
which
has
been
advanced
and
invested
in
means
of
production
because
every
activity
of
labour
requires
certain
raw
materials
tools
and
buildings
the
capitalist
character
of
this
state
of
affairs
is
expressed
by
the
fact
that
these
means
of
production
appear
as
capital
as
the
property
of
a
person
other
than
the
labourer
divorced
from
labour
the
property
of
those
who
themselves
do
not
work
secondly
the
constant
capital
a
mere
advance
laid
out
for
the
purpose
of
creating
surplus
value
appears
here
only
as
the
foundation
of
yet
the
concept
of
constant
capital
involves
more
than
this
it
expresses
the
function
of
the
means
of
production
in
the
process
of
human
labour
quite
independently
of
all
its
historical
or
social
forms
everybody
must
have
raw
materials
and
working
tools
the
means
of
production
be
it
the
south
sea
islander
for
making
his
family
canoe
the
communist
peasant
community
in
india
for
the
cultivation
of
their
communal
land
the
egyptian
fellah
for
tilling
his
village
lands
or
for
building
pharaoh
pyramids
the
greek
slave
in
the
small
workshops
of
athens
the
feudal
serf
the
master
craftsman
of
the
medieval
guild
or
the
modern
wage
labourer
they
all
require
means
of
production
which
having
resulted
from
human
labour
express
the
link
between
human
labour
and
natural
matter
and
constitute
the
eternal
and
universal
prerequisites
of
the
human
process
of
production
in
the
formula
v
stands
for
a
certain
function
of
the
means
of
production
which
is
not
wiped
out
in
the
succession
of
the
labour
process
whereas
it
is
completely
immaterial
for
both
the
exchange
and
the
actual
use
made
of
a
commodity
whether
it
has
been
produced
by
paid
or
by
unpaid
labour
by
wage
labour
slave
labour
forced
labour
or
any
other
kind
of
labour
on
the
other
hand
it
is
of
decisive
importance
as
for
using
it
whether
the
commodity
is
itself
a
means
of
production
or
a
consumer
good
whether
paid
or
unpaid
labour
has
been
employed
in
the
production
of
a
machine
matters
to
the
machinery
manufacturer
and
to
his
workers
but
only
to
them
for
society
when
it
acquires
this
machine
by
an
act
of
exchange
only
the
quality
of
this
machine
as
a
means
of
production
only
its
function
in
the
process
of
production
is
of
importance
just
as
every
producing
society
since
time
immemorial
has
had
to
give
due
regard
to
the
important
function
of
the
means
of
production
by
arranging
in
each
period
of
production
for
the
manufacture
of
the
means
of
production
requisite
for
the
next
period
so
capitalist
society
too
can
not
achieve
its
annual
production
of
value
to
accord
with
the
formula
which
indicates
the
exploitation
of
wage
labour
unless
there
exists
as
the
result
of
the
preceding
period
the
quantity
of
means
of
production
necessary
to
make
up
the
constant
capital
this
specific
connection
of
each
past
period
of
production
with
the
period
following
forms
the
universal
and
eternal
foundation
of
the
social
process
of
reproduction
and
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
every
period
parts
of
the
produce
are
destined
to
become
the
means
of
production
for
the
succeeding
period
but
this
relation
remained
hidden
from
smith
sight
he
was
not
interested
in
means
of
production
in
respect
of
their
specific
function
within
the
process
to
which
they
are
applied
he
was
only
concerned
with
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
like
any
other
commodity
themselves
the
product
of
wage
labour
that
has
been
employed
in
a
capitalist
manner
the
specifically
capitalist
function
of
wage
labour
in
the
productive
process
completely
obscured
for
him
the
eternal
and
universal
function
of
the
means
of
production
within
the
labour
process
his
narrow
bourgeois
approach
overlooked
completely
the
general
relations
between
man
and
nature
underneath
the
specific
social
relations
between
capital
and
wage
labour
here
it
seems
is
the
real
source
of
adam
smith
strange
dogma
that
the
total
value
of
the
annual
social
product
can
be
resolved
into
he
overlooked
the
fact
that
as
the
first
link
in
the
formula
v
is
the
essential
expression
of
the
general
social
foundation
of
exploitation
of
wage
labour
by
capital
we
conclude
that
the
value
of
every
commodity
must
be
expressed
by
the
formula
v
the
question
now
arises
how
far
this
formula
applies
to
the
aggregate
of
commodities
within
a
society
let
us
turn
to
the
doubts
expressed
by
smith
on
this
point
the
statement
that
an
individual
fixed
and
circulating
capital
and
his
revenue
do
not
strictly
correspond
to
the
same
categories
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
cf
above
no
what
is
circulating
capital
for
one
person
is
not
capital
for
another
but
revenue
as
for
instance
capital
advances
for
wages
this
statement
is
based
upon
an
error
if
the
capitalist
pays
wages
to
the
workers
he
does
not
abandon
his
variable
capital
and
let
it
stray
into
the
workers
hands
to
become
their
income
he
only
exchanges
the
of
his
variable
capital
against
its
natural
form
labour
power
the
variable
capital
remains
always
in
the
hand
of
the
capitalist
first
as
money
and
then
as
labour
power
to
revert
to
him
later
together
with
the
surplus
value
as
the
cash
proceeds
from
the
commodities
the
worker
on
the
other
hand
never
gains
possession
of
the
variable
capital
his
labour
power
is
never
capital
to
him
but
it
is
his
only
asset
the
power
to
work
is
the
only
thing
he
possesses
again
if
he
has
sold
it
and
taken
a
money
wage
this
wage
is
for
him
not
capital
but
the
price
of
his
commodity
which
he
has
sold
finally
the
fact
that
the
worker
buys
provisions
with
the
wages
he
has
received
has
no
more
connection
with
the
function
this
money
once
fulfilled
as
variable
capital
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalist
than
has
the
private
use
a
vendor
of
a
commodity
can
make
of
the
money
he
has
obtained
by
a
sale
it
is
not
the
capitalist
variable
capital
which
becomes
the
workers
income
but
the
price
of
the
worker
commodity
power
which
he
has
sold
while
the
variable
capital
now
as
ever
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalist
and
fulfils
its
specific
function
equally
erroneous
is
the
conception
that
the
income
of
the
capitalist
the
surplus
value
which
is
hidden
in
machines
in
our
example
of
a
machinery
manufacturer
which
has
not
as
yet
been
realised
is
fixed
capital
for
another
person
the
buyer
of
the
machines
it
is
not
the
machines
or
parts
of
them
which
form
the
income
of
the
machinery
manufacturer
but
the
surplus
value
that
is
hidden
in
them
the
unpaid
labour
of
his
wage
labourers
after
the
machine
has
been
sold
this
income
simply
remains
as
before
in
the
hand
of
the
machinery
manufacturer
it
has
only
changed
its
outward
shape
it
has
been
changed
from
the
into
the
conversely
the
buyer
of
this
machine
has
not
by
its
purchase
newly
obtained
possession
of
his
fixed
capital
for
he
had
this
fixed
capital
in
hand
even
before
the
purchase
in
the
form
of
a
certain
amount
of
cash
by
buying
this
machine
he
has
only
given
to
his
capital
the
adequate
material
form
for
it
to
become
productive
the
income
or
surplus
value
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
machinery
manufacturer
before
and
after
the
sale
of
the
machine
and
the
fixed
capital
remains
in
the
hands
of
the
other
person
the
capitalist
buyer
of
the
machine
just
as
the
variable
capital
in
the
first
example
always
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalist
and
the
income
in
the
hands
of
the
worker
smith
and
his
followers
have
caused
confusion
because
in
their
investigation
of
capitalist
exchange
they
mixed
up
the
of
the
commodities
with
their
relations
of
value
further
they
did
not
distinguish
the
individual
circulations
of
capitals
and
commodities
which
are
ever
interlacing
one
and
the
same
act
of
exchange
can
be
circulation
of
capital
when
seen
from
one
aspect
and
at
the
same
time
simple
commodity
exchange
for
the
purpose
of
consumption
the
fallacy
that
whatever
is
capital
for
one
person
must
be
income
for
another
and
must
be
translated
thus
into
the
correct
statement
that
what
is
circulation
of
capital
for
one
person
may
be
simple
commodity
exchange
for
another
and
this
only
expresses
the
capacity
of
capital
to
undergo
transformations
of
its
character
and
the
interconnections
of
various
spheres
of
interest
in
the
social
process
of
exchange
the
sharply
outlined
existence
of
capital
in
contrast
with
income
still
stands
in
both
its
clearly
defined
forms
of
constant
and
variable
capital
even
so
smith
comes
very
close
to
the
truth
when
he
states
that
capital
and
income
of
the
individual
are
not
strictly
identical
with
the
same
categories
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
community
only
a
few
further
connecting
links
are
lacking
for
a
clear
revelation
of
the
true
relationship

in
this
connection
we
have
disregarded
the
contrary
conception
which
also
runs
through
the
work
of
smith
according
to
that
the
of
the
commodity
can
not
be
resolved
into
though
the
of
commodities
consists
in
this
distinction
however
is
more
important
with
regard
to
smith
theory
of
value
than
in
the
present
context
where
we
are
mainly
interested
in
his
formula
marx
scheme
of
simple
reproduction
let
us
now
consider
the
formula
v
as
the
expression
of
the
social
product
as
a
whole
is
it
only
a
theoretical
abstraction
or
does
it
convey
any
real
meaning
when
applied
to
social
life
has
the
formula
any
objective
existence
in
relation
to
society
as
a
whole
it
was
left
to
marx
to
establish
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
constant
capital
in
economic
theory
yet
adam
smith
before
him
working
exclusively
with
the
categories
of
fixed
and
circulating
capital
in
effect
transformed
this
fixed
capital
into
constant
capital
though
he
was
not
aware
of
having
achieved
this
result
this
constant
capital
comprises
not
only
those
means
of
production
which
wear
out
in
the
course
of
years
but
also
those
which
are
completely
absorbed
by
production
in
any
one
year
his
very
dogma
that
the
total
value
is
resolved
into
and
his
arguments
on
this
point
lead
smith
to
distinguish
between
the
two
categories
of
production
living
labour
and
inanimate
means
of
production
on
the
other
hand
when
he
tries
to
construe
the
social
process
of
reproduction
on
the
basis
of
the
capitals
and
incomes
of
individuals
the
fixed
capital
he
conceives
of
as
existing
apart
from
these
is
in
fact
constant
capital
every
individual
capitalist
uses
for
the
production
of
his
commodities
certain
material
means
of
production
such
as
premises
raw
materials
and
instruments
in
order
to
produce
the
aggregate
of
commodities
in
a
given
society
an
aggregate
of
all
material
means
of
production
used
by
the
individual
capitalists
is
an
obvious
requisite
the
existence
of
these
means
of
production
within
the
society
is
a
real
fact
though
they
themselves
exist
in
the
form
of
purely
private
individual
capitals
this
is
the
universal
absolute
condition
of
social
production
in
all
its
historical
forms
the
specific
capitalist
form
manifests
itself
in
the
fact
that
the
material
means
of
production
function
as
as
constant
capital
the
property
of
those
who
do
not
work
it
is
the
opposite
pole
to
proletarianised
labour
power
the
counterpart
of
wage
labour
the
variable
capital
is
the
aggregate
of
wages
actually
paid
in
the
society
in
the
course
of
a
year
production
this
fact
too
has
real
objective
existence
although
it
manifests
itself
in
an
innumerable
mass
of
individual
wages
in
every
society
the
amount
of
labour
power
actually
engaged
in
production
and
the
annual
maintenance
of
the
workers
is
a
question
of
decisive
importance
where
this
factor
takes
the
specific
capitalist
form
of
the
variable
capital
it
follows
that
the
means
of
subsistence
first
come
to
the
workers
in
form
of
a
wage
which
is
the
price
of
the
labour
power
they
have
sold
to
another
person
the
owner
of
the
material
means
of
production
who
does
not
work
himself
under
this
aspect
it
is
the
latter
capitalist
property
further
is
an
aggregate
of
money
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
in
a
form
of
pure
value
this
concept
of
implies
that
the
workers
are
free
in
a
double
sense
free
in
person
and
free
of
all
means
of
production
it
also
expresses
the
fact
that
in
a
given
society
the
universal
form
of
production
is
commodity
production
finally
the
surplus
value
stands
for
the
total
of
all
surplus
values
gained
by
the
individual
capitalists
every
society
performs
surplus
labour
and
even
a
socialist
society
will
have
to
do
the
same
it
must
perform
surplus
labour
in
a
threefold
sense
it
has
to
provide
a
quantity
of
labour
for
the
maintenance
of
those
who
are
unable
to
work
such
as
children
old
people
invalids
and
also
civil
servants
and
the
liberal
professions
who
do
not
take
an
immediate
part
in
the
satisfaction
of
material
wants
it
has
to
provide
a
fund
of
social
insurance
against
elementary
disasters
which
may
threaten
the
annual
produce
such
as
bad
harvests
forest
fires
and
floods
and
lastly
it
must
provide
a
fund
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
production
either
because
of
an
increase
in
the
population
or
because
higher
standards
of
civilisation
lead
to
additional
wants
it
is
in
two
respects
that
the
capitalist
character
manifests
itself
surplus
labour
comes
into
being
as
surplus
value
in
realisable
in
cash
and
as
the
property
of
of
those
who
own
the
means
of
production
similarly
if
we
consider
these
two
amounts
taken
together
we
see
that
they
represent
objective
quantities
of
universal
validity
the
total
of
living
labour
that
has
been
performed
within
a
society
in
the
course
of
one
year
every
human
society
whatever
its
historical
form
must
take
note
of
this
datum
with
reference
to
both
the
results
that
have
been
achieved
and
the
existing
and
available
labour
power
the
division
into
is
a
universal
phenomenon
independent
of
the
society
particular
historical
form
in
its
capitalist
form
this
division
shows
itself
not
only
in
the
qualitative
peculiarities
of
both
and
as
already
outlined
but
also
in
their
quantitative
relationship
tends
to
become
depressed
to
a
minimum
level
just
sufficient
for
the
physiological
and
social
existence
of
the
worker
and
tends
to
increase
continually
at
the
cost
of
and
relative
to
the
predominant
feature
of
capitalist
production
is
expressed
in
this
last
circumstance
it
is
the
fact
that
the
creation
and
appropriation
of
surplus
value
is
the
real
purpose
of
and
the
incentive
to
production
we
have
examined
the
relations
upon
which
the
capitalist
formula
of
the
aggregate
product
is
based
and
have
found
them
universally
valid
in
every
planned
economy
they
are
made
the
object
of
conscious
regulation
on
the
part
of
society
in
a
communist
society
by
the
community
of
workers
and
their
democratic
organs
and
in
a
society
based
upon
by
the
nucleus
of
owners
and
their
despotic
power
in
a
system
of
capitalist
production
there
is
no
such
planned
regulation
the
aggregate
of
the
society
capitals
and
the
aggregate
of
its
commodities
alike
consist
in
reality
of
innumerable
fragments
of
individual
capitals
and
individual
items
of
merchandise
taken
together
thus
the
question
arises
whether
these
sums
themselves
mean
anything
more
in
a
capitalist
society
than
a
mere
statistical
enumeration
which
is
moreover
inexact
and
fluid
applying
the
standards
of
society
as
a
whole
we
perceive
that
the
completely
independent
and
sovereign
individual
existence
of
private
enterprises
is
only
the
historically
conditioned
form
whereas
it
is
social
interconnections
that
provide
the
foundation
although
individual
capitals
act
in
complete
independence
of
one
another
and
a
social
regulation
is
completely
lacking
the
movement
of
capitals
forms
a
homogeneous
whole
this
movement
too
appears
in
specifically
capitalist
forms
in
every
planned
system
of
production
it
is
above
all
the
relation
between
all
labour
past
and
present
and
the
means
of
production
between
and
according
to
our
formula
or
the
relation
between
the
aggregate
of
necessary
consumer
goods
again
in
the
terms
of
our
formula
and
which
are
subjected
to
regulation
under
capitalist
conditions
on
the
other
hand
all
social
labour
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
inanimate
means
of
production
and
also
of
living
labour
power
is
treated
as
one
entity
as
capital
in
contrast
with
the
surplus
labour
that
has
been
performed
with
the
surplus
value
the
relation
between
these
two
quantities
and
is
a
palpably
real
objective
relationship
of
capitalist
society
it
is
the
average
rate
of
profit
every
capital
is
in
fact
treated
only
as
part
of
a
common
whole
the
whole
of
social
capital
and
assigned
the
profit
to
which
it
is
entitled
according
to
its
size
out
of
the
surplus
value
wrested
from
society
regardless
of
the
quantity
which
this
particular
capital
has
actually
created
thus
social
capital
and
its
counterpart
the
whole
of
social
surplus
value
are
not
merely
real
quantities
having
an
objective
existence
but
what
is
more
the
relation
between
them
the
average
profit
guides
and
directs
the
whole
process
of
exchange
this
it
does
in
three
ways
by
the
mechanism
of
the
law
of
value
which
establishes
the
quantitative
relations
of
exchange
between
the
individual
kinds
of
commodities
independently
of
their
specific
value
relationship
by
the
social
division
of
labour
the
assignment
of
certain
portions
of
capital
and
labour
to
the
individual
spheres
of
production
by
the
development
of
labour
productivity
which
on
the
one
hand
stimulates
individual
capitals
to
engage
in
pioneering
work
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
higher
profit
than
the
average
and
on
the
other
hand
extends
the
progress
that
has
been
achieved
by
individuals
over
the
whole
field
of
production
by
means
of
the
average
rate
of
profit
in
a
word
the
total
capital
of
society
completely
governs
the
seemingly
independent
motions
of
individual
capitals
the
formula
v
thus
applies
to
the
aggregate
of
commodities
produced
in
a
society
under
capitalism
no
less
than
to
the
value
composition
of
every
individual
commodity
it
is
however
only
the
for
which
this
holds
good
the
analogy
can
not
be
carried
further
the
formula
is
indeed
perfectly
exact
if
we
regard
the
total
product
of
a
capitalistically
producing
society
as
the
output
of
one
year
labour
and
wish
to
analyse
it
into
its
respective
components
the
quantity
shows
how
much
of
the
labour
of
former
years
has
been
taken
over
towards
the
product
of
the
present
year
in
the
form
of
means
of
production
quantities
show
the
value
components
of
the
product
created
by
new
labour
during
the
last
year
only
the
relation
between
and
finally
shows
us
how
the
annual
labour
programme
of
society
is
apportioned
to
the
two
tasks
of
maintaining
the
workers
and
maintaining
those
who
do
not
work
this
analysis
remains
valid
and
correct
also
with
regard
to
the
reproduction
of
individual
capital
no
matter
what
may
be
the
material
form
of
the
product
this
capital
has
created
all
three
and
appear
alike
to
a
capitalist
of
the
machinery
industry
in
the
form
of
machinery
and
its
parts
to
the
owner
of
a
music
hall
they
are
represented
by
the
charms
of
the
dancers
and
the
skill
of
the
acrobats
so
long
as
the
product
is
left
undifferentiated
and
differ
from
one
another
only
in
so
far
as
they
are
components
of
value
this
is
quite
sufficient
for
the
reproduction
of
individual
capital
as
such
reproduction
begins
with
the
of
capital
a
certain
amount
of
money
that
has
been
gained
by
the
realisation
of
the
manufactured
product
the
formula
v
then
is
the
given
basis
for
the
division
of
this
amount
of
money
one
part
for
the
purchase
of
the
material
means
of
production
a
second
part
for
the
purchase
of
labour
power
and
a
third
part
in
the
case
of
simple
reproduction
assumed
in
the
first
instance
for
the
personal
consumption
in
the
case
of
expanding
reproduction
part
three
is
further
subdivided
only
a
fraction
of
it
being
devoted
to
the
capitalist
personal
consumption
the
remainder
to
increasing
his
capital
in
order
to
reproduce
his
capital
actually
the
capitalist
must
of
course
turn
again
to
the
commodity
market
with
the
capital
he
has
divided
in
this
manner
so
that
he
can
acquire
the
material
prerequisites
of
production
such
as
raw
materials
instruments
and
so
on
it
seems
a
matter
of
course
to
the
individual
capitalist
as
well
as
to
his
scientific
ideologist
the
economist
that
he
should
in
fact
find
there
just
those
means
of
production
and
labour
power
he
needs
for
his
business
the
position
is
different
as
regards
the
total
production
of
a
society
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
as
a
whole
the
exchange
of
commodities
can
only
effect
a
shifting
around
whereby
the
individual
parts
of
the
total
product
change
hands
the
material
composition
of
the
product
however
can
not
be
changed
by
this
process
after
this
change
of
places
as
well
as
before
it
there
can
be
reproduction
of
total
capital
if
and
only
if
there
is
in
the
total
product
of
the
preceding
period
first
a
sufficient
quantity
of
means
of
production
secondly
adequate
provisions
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
labour
as
hitherto
and
last
but
not
least
the
goods
necessary
to
maintain
the
capitalist
class
and
its
in
a
manner
suitable
to
their
station
this
brings
us
to
a
new
plane
we
are
now
concerned
with
material
points
of
view
instead
of
pure
relations
of
value
it
is
the
of
the
total
social
product
that
matters
now
what
the
individual
capitalist
considers
nobody
else
business
becomes
a
matter
of
grave
concern
for
the
totality
of
capitalists
whereas
it
does
not
make
the
slightest
difference
to
the
individual
capitalist
whether
he
produces
machinery
sugar
artificial
manure
or
a
progressive
newspaper
provided
only
that
he
can
find
a
buyer
for
his
commodity
so
that
he
can
get
back
his
capital
plus
surplus
value
it
matters
infinitely
to
the
capitalist
that
his
total
product
should
have
a
definite
by
that
we
mean
that
it
must
provide
three
essentials
the
means
of
production
to
renew
the
labour
process
simple
provisions
for
the
maintenance
of
the
workers
and
provisions
of
higher
quality
and
luxury
goods
for
the
preservation
of
the
capitalist
himself
his
desire
in
this
respect
is
not
general
and
vague
but
determined
precisely
and
quantitatively
if
we
ask
what
quantities
of
all
three
categories
are
required
by
the
capitalist
the
of
last
total
product
gives
us
a
definite
estimate
as
long
that
is
as
we
confine
ourselves
to
simple
reproduction
which
we
have
taken
for
our
starting
point
hitherto
we
have
conceived
of
the
formula
v
as
a
merely
quantitative
division
of
the
total
value
applicable
alike
to
total
capital
and
to
individual
capital
and
representing
the
quantity
of
labour
contained
in
the
annual
product
of
society
now
we
see
that
the
formula
is
also
the
basis
of
the
material
composition
of
the
product
obviously
the
capitalist
if
he
is
to
take
up
reproduction
to
the
same
extent
as
before
must
find
in
his
new
total
product
as
many
means
of
production
as
correspond
to
the
size
of
as
many
simple
provisions
for
the
workers
as
correspond
to
the
sum
of
wages
and
as
many
provisions
of
better
quality
for
himself
and
his
as
correspond
to
in
this
way
our
analysis
of
the
value
of
the
society
aggregate
product
is
translated
into
a
general
recipe
for
this
product
as
follows
the
total
of
society
must
be
in
an
equal
quantity
of
means
of
production
the
in
provisions
for
the
workers
and
the
in
provisions
for
the
capitalists
in
order
that
simple
reproduction
may
take
place
here
we
come
up
against
palpable
differences
between
the
individual
capitalist
and
the
total
capitalist
the
manner
in
which
the
former
always
reproduces
his
constant
and
variable
capital
as
well
as
his
surplus
value
is
such
that
all
three
parts
are
contained
in
the
same
material
form
within
his
homogeneous
product
that
this
material
form
moreover
is
completely
irrelevant
and
may
have
different
qualities
in
the
case
of
each
individual
capitalist
the
capitalist
for
his
part
reproduces
every
component
of
the
value
of
his
annual
product
in
a
different
material
form
as
means
of
production
as
provisions
for
the
workers
and
as
provisions
for
the
capitalists
in
the
case
of
the
reproduction
of
individual
capitals
there
is
no
discrepancy
between
relations
of
value
and
material
points
of
view
besides
it
is
quite
clear
that
individual
capital
may
concentrate
on
aspects
of
value
accepting
material
conditions
as
a
law
from
heaven
as
phenomena
of
whereas
the
capitalist
has
to
reckon
with
material
points
of
view
if
the
total
of
society
were
not
reproduced
annually
in
the
form
of
an
equal
amount
of
means
of
production
every
individual
capitalist
would
be
doomed
to
search
the
commodity
market
in
vain
with
his
realised
in
cash
unable
to
find
the
requisite
materials
for
his
individual
reproduction
from
the
point
of
view
of
reproducing
the
total
capital
the
formula
v
is
inadequate
this
again
is
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
concept
of
total
capital
is
something
real
and
does
not
merely
paraphrase
the
concept
of
production
we
must
however
make
general
distinctions
in
our
exposition
of
total
capital
instead
of
showing
it
as
a
homogeneous
whole
we
must
demonstrate
its
three
main
categories
and
we
shall
not
vitiate
our
theory
if
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
we
consider
for
the
present
only
two
departments
of
total
capital
the
production
of
producer
goods
and
that
of
consumer
goods
for
workers
and
capitalists
we
have
to
examine
each
department
separately
adhering
to
the
fundamental
conditions
of
capitalist
production
in
each
case
at
the
same
time
we
must
also
emphasise
the
mutual
connections
between
these
two
departments
from
the
point
of
view
of
reproduction
for
only
if
each
is
regarded
in
connection
with
the
other
do
they
make
up
the
basis
of
the
social
capital
as
a
whole
we
made
a
start
by
investigating
individual
capital
but
we
must
approach
the
demonstration
of
total
capital
and
its
total
product
in
a
somewhat
different
manner
quantitatively
as
a
quantity
of
value
the
of
society
consists
precisely
in
the
total
of
individual
constant
capitals
and
the
same
applies
to
the
other
amounts
and
but
the
outward
shape
of
each
has
changed
the
of
constant
capitals
from
the
process
of
production
as
an
element
of
value
with
infinitely
varied
facets
comprising
a
host
of
variegated
objects
for
use
but
in
the
total
product
it
appears
as
it
were
contracted
into
a
certain
quantity
of
means
of
production
similarly
with
and
which
in
the
case
of
the
individual
capitalist
as
items
in
a
most
colourful
jumble
of
commodities
being
provisions
in
adequate
quantities
for
the
workers
and
capitalists
adam
smith
came
very
close
to
recognising
this
fact
when
he
observed
that
the
categories
of
fixed
and
circulating
capital
and
of
revenue
in
relation
to
the
individual
capitalist
do
not
coincide
with
these
categories
in
the
case
of
society
we
have
come
to
the
following
conclusions
the
formula
v
serves
to
express
the
production
of
society
viewed
as
a
whole
as
well
as
the
production
of
individual
capitalists
social
production
is
divided
into
two
departments
engaged
in
the
production
of
producer
and
consumer
goods
respectively
both
departments
work
according
to
capitalist
methods
that
is
to
say
they
both
aim
at
the
production
of
surplus
value
and
thus
the
formula
v
will
apply
to
each
of
them
the
two
departments
are
interdependent
and
are
therefore
bound
to
display
a
certain
quantitative
relationship
namely
the
one
department
must
produce
all
means
of
production
the
other
all
provisions
for
the
workers
and
capitalists
of
both
departments
proceeding
from
this
point
of
view
marx
devised
the
following
diagram
of
capitalist
reproduction
i
means
of
production
ii
articles
of
consumption
the
figures
in
this
diagram
express
quantities
of
value
amounts
of
money
which
are
chosen
arbitrarily
but
their
ratios
are
exact
each
department
is
characterised
by
the
of
the
commodities
produced
their
mutual
circulation
takes
place
as
follows
department
i
supplies
the
means
of
production
for
the
entire
productive
process
for
itself
as
well
as
for
department
ii
from
this
alone
it
follows
that
for
the
undisturbed
continuance
of
reproduction
for
we
still
presume
simple
reproduction
on
the
old
scale
the
total
produce
of
department
i
i
must
have
the
same
value
as
the
sum
of
constant
capitals
in
both
departments
i
ii
similarly
department
ii
supplies
provisions
for
the
whole
of
society
for
its
own
workers
and
capitalists
as
well
as
for
the
workers
and
capitalists
of
department
i
hence
it
follows
that
for
the
undisturbed
course
of
consumption
and
production
and
its
renewal
on
the
old
scale
it
is
necessary
that
the
total
quantity
of
provisions
supplied
by
department
ii
should
equal
in
value
all
the
incomes
of
the
employed
workers
and
capitalists
of
society
here
ii
i
ii
here
we
have
indeed
expressed
relationships
of
value
which
are
the
foundation
not
only
of
capitalist
reproduction
but
of
reproduction
in
every
society
in
every
producing
society
whatever
its
social
form
in
the
primitive
small
village
community
of
the
bakairi
of
brazil
in
the
of
a
timon
of
athens
with
its
slaves
or
in
the
imperial
farm
of
charlemagne
the
labour
power
available
for
society
must
be
distributed
in
such
a
way
that
means
of
production
as
well
as
provisions
are
produced
in
adequate
quantities
the
former
must
suffice
for
the
immediate
production
of
provisions
as
well
as
for
the
future
renewal
of
the
means
of
production
themselves
and
the
provisions
in
their
turn
must
suffice
for
the
maintenance
of
the
workers
occupied
in
the
production
alike
of
these
same
provisions
and
of
the
means
of
production
and
moreover
for
the
maintenance
of
all
those
who
do
not
work
in
its
broad
outline
marx
scheme
corresponds
with
the
universal
and
absolute
foundation
of
social
reproduction
with
only
the
following
specifications
socially
necessary
labour
appears
here
as
value
the
means
of
production
as
constant
capital
the
labour
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
workers
as
variable
capital
and
that
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
those
who
do
not
work
as
surplus
value
in
capitalist
society
however
the
connections
between
these
two
great
departments
depend
upon
exchange
of
commodities
on
the
exchange
of
equivalents
the
workers
and
capitalists
of
department
i
can
only
obtain
as
many
provisions
from
department
ii
as
they
can
deliver
of
their
own
commodities
the
means
of
production
the
demand
of
department
ii
for
means
of
production
on
the
other
hand
is
determined
by
the
size
of
its
constant
capital
it
follows
therefore
that
the
sum
of
the
variable
capital
and
of
the
surplus
value
in
the
production
of
producer
goods
here
i
must
equal
the
constant
capital
in
the
production
of
provisions
here
ii
an
important
proviso
remains
to
be
added
to
the
above
scheme
the
constant
capital
which
has
been
spent
by
the
two
departments
is
in
reality
only
part
of
the
constant
capital
used
by
society
this
constant
capital
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
is
fixed
capital
premises
tools
labouring
cattle
which
functions
in
a
number
of
periods
of
production
in
every
one
of
which
however
only
part
of
its
value
is
absorbed
by
the
product
according
to
the
amount
of
its
wear
and
tear
the
second
is
circulating
capital
such
as
raw
materials
auxiliary
products
fuel
and
lighting
its
whole
value
is
completely
absorbed
by
the
new
product
in
every
period
of
production
yet
only
that
part
of
the
means
of
production
is
relevant
for
reproduction
which
is
actually
absorbed
by
the
production
of
value
without
becoming
less
correct
an
exact
exposition
of
social
circulation
may
disregard
the
remaining
part
of
the
fixed
capital
which
has
not
been
absorbed
by
the
product
though
it
should
not
completely
forget
it
this
is
easy
to
prove
let
us
assume
that
the
constant
capital
in
the
two
departments
which
is
in
fact
absorbed
by
the
annual
product
of
these
departments
consists
of
fixed
and
circulating
capital
the
of
fixed
capital
representing
here
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
the
premises
machinery
and
labouring
cattle
this
annual
wear
and
tear
equals
say
per
cent
of
the
total
value
of
the
fixed
capital
employed
then
the
total
social
capital
would
really
consist
of
the
constant
capital
in
both
departments
being
of
fixed
and
of
circulating
capital
since
the
term
of
life
of
the
aggregate
fixed
capital
with
a
per
cent
wear
and
tear
is
ten
years
the
fixed
capital
needs
renewal
only
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
meanwhile
of
its
value
enters
into
social
production
in
every
year
if
all
the
fixed
capital
of
a
society
with
the
same
rate
of
wear
and
tear
were
of
equal
durability
it
would
on
our
assumption
need
complete
renewal
once
within
ten
years
this
however
is
not
the
case
some
of
the
various
which
are
part
of
the
fixed
capital
may
last
longer
and
others
shorter
wear
and
tear
and
duration
of
life
are
quite
different
in
the
different
kinds
and
individual
representations
of
fixed
capital
in
consequence
fixed
capital
need
not
be
renewed
reproduced
in
its
concrete
all
at
once
but
parts
of
it
are
continually
renewed
at
various
stages
of
social
production
while
other
parts
still
function
in
their
older
form
our
assumption
of
a
fixed
capital
of
with
a
per
cent
rate
of
wear
and
tear
does
not
mean
that
this
must
be
renewed
all
at
once
every
ten
years
but
that
an
annual
average
renewal
and
replacement
must
be
effected
of
a
part
of
the
total
fixed
social
capital
corresponding
to
of
its
value
that
is
to
say
department
i
which
has
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
society
for
means
of
production
must
reproduce
year
by
year
not
only
all
its
raw
and
partly
finished
materials
its
circulating
capital
to
the
value
of
but
must
also
reproduce
the
of
its
fixed
capital
premises
machinery
and
the
like
to
the
extent
of
corresponding
with
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
fixed
capital
if
department
i
continues
in
this
manner
to
renew
of
the
fixed
capital
in
its
every
year
the
result
will
be
that
every
ten
years
the
total
fixed
capital
of
society
will
have
been
replaced
throughout
by
new
items
thus
it
follows
that
the
reproduction
of
those
parts
disregarded
so
far
is
also
completely
accounted
for
in
the
above
scheme
in
practice
the
procedure
is
that
every
capitalist
sets
aside
from
his
annual
production
from
the
realisation
of
his
commodities
a
certain
amount
for
the
redemption
of
his
fixed
capital
these
individual
annual
deductions
must
amount
to
a
certain
quantity
of
capital
therefore
the
capitalist
has
in
fact
renewed
his
fixed
capital
that
is
he
has
replaced
it
by
new
and
more
efficient
items
this
alternating
procedure
of
building
up
annual
reserves
of
money
for
the
renewal
of
fixed
capital
and
of
the
periodical
employment
of
the
accumulated
amounts
for
the
actual
renewal
of
fixed
capital
varies
with
the
individual
capitalist
so
that
some
are
accumulating
reserves
while
others
have
already
started
their
renewals
thus
every
year
part
of
the
fixed
capital
is
actually
renewed
the
monetary
procedure
here
only
disguises
the
real
process
which
characterises
the
reproduction
of
fixed
capital
on
closer
observation
we
see
that
this
is
as
it
should
be
the
whole
of
the
fixed
capital
takes
part
in
the
process
of
production
for
physically
the
mass
of
usable
objects
premises
machinery
labouring
cattle
are
completely
employed
it
is
their
peculiarity
as
fixed
capital
on
the
other
hand
that
only
part
of
the
value
is
absorbed
in
the
production
of
value
since
in
the
process
of
reproduction
again
postulating
simple
reproduction
all
that
matters
is
to
replace
in
their
natural
form
the
values
which
have
been
actually
used
up
as
means
of
subsistence
and
production
during
a
year
production
therefore
fixed
capital
need
only
be
reproduced
to
the
extent
that
it
has
in
fact
been
used
up
in
the
production
of
commodities
the
remaining
portion
of
value
embodied
in
the
total
of
fixed
capital
is
of
decisive
importance
for
production
as
a
labour
process
but
does
not
exist
for
the
annual
reproduction
of
society
as
a
process
of
besides
this
process
which
is
here
expressed
by
relations
of
value
applies
equally
to
every
society
even
to
a
community
which
does
not
produce
commodities
if
once
upon
a
time
for
instance
say
ten
labour
of
fellaheen
was
required
for
the
construction
of
the
famous
lake
moeris
and
the
related
nile
canals
that
miraculous
lake
which
herodotus
tells
us
was
made
by
hand
and
if
for
the
maintenance
of
this
the
most
magnificent
drainage
system
of
the
world
the
labour
of
a
further
fellaheen
was
annually
required
the
figures
of
course
are
chosen
at
random
we
might
say
that
after
every
hundred
years
the
moeris
dam
and
the
canals
were
reproduced
anew
although
in
fact
the
entire
system
was
not
constructed
as
a
whole
in
every
century
this
is
manifestly
true
when
amid
the
stormy
incidents
of
political
history
and
alien
conquests
the
usual
crude
neglect
of
old
monuments
of
culture
set
in
as
displayed
by
the
english
in
india
when
the
reproductional
needs
of
ancient
civilisations
were
understood
no
longer
then
in
the
course
of
time
the
whole
lake
moeris
its
water
dikes
and
canals
the
two
pyramids
in
its
midst
the
colossus
upon
it
and
other
marvellous
erections
disappeared
without
a
trace
as
though
they
had
never
been
built
only
ten
lines
in
herodotus
a
dot
on
ptolemy
map
of
the
world
traces
of
old
cultures
and
of
villages
and
cities
bear
witness
that
at
one
time
rich
life
sprang
from
this
magnificent
irrigation
system
where
there
are
only
stretches
of
arid
desert
in
inner
lybia
and
desolate
swamps
along
the
coast
there
is
only
one
point
where
marx
scheme
of
simple
reproduction
may
appear
unsatisfactory
or
incomplete
in
relation
to
constant
capital
and
that
is
when
we
go
back
to
that
period
of
production
when
the
total
fixed
capital
was
first
created
indeed
society
possesses
transformed
labour
amounting
to
more
than
those
parts
of
fixed
capital
which
are
absorbed
into
the
value
of
the
annual
product
and
are
in
turn
replaced
by
it
in
the
figures
of
our
example
the
total
social
capital
does
not
consist
of
as
in
the
diagram
but
of
though
of
the
fixed
capital
which
on
our
assumption
amounts
to
are
annually
reproduced
in
the
form
of
appropriate
means
of
production
an
equal
amount
is
also
consumed
by
the
same
production
each
year
though
the
whole
of
the
fixed
capital
as
a
an
aggregate
of
objects
has
been
renewed
after
ten
years
society
possesses
in
the
eleventh
just
as
in
any
other
year
a
fixed
capital
of
whereas
it
has
annually
achieved
only
and
its
constant
capital
as
a
whole
is
whereas
it
has
created
only
obviously
since
it
must
have
created
this
surplus
of
fixed
capital
by
its
labour
it
possesses
more
accumulated
past
labour
than
our
scheme
of
reproduction
warrants
even
at
this
stage
the
annual
labour
of
society
must
be
based
on
some
previous
annual
labour
that
has
been
hoarded
this
question
of
past
labour
however
as
the
foundation
of
all
present
labour
brings
us
to
the
very
first
beginning
which
is
as
meaningless
with
regard
to
the
economic
development
of
mankind
as
it
is
for
the
natural
development
of
matter
the
scheme
of
reproduction
grasps
the
social
process
as
perpetually
in
motion
as
a
link
in
the
endless
chain
of
events
it
neither
wants
to
demonstrate
its
initial
origin
nor
should
it
do
so
the
social
reproductive
process
is
always
based
on
past
labour
we
may
trace
it
back
as
far
as
we
like
social
labour
has
no
beginning
just
as
it
has
no
end
like
the
historical
origin
of
herodotus
lake
moeris
the
beginnings
of
the
reproductive
process
in
the
history
of
civilisation
are
lost
in
the
twilight
of
legend
with
the
progress
of
techniques
and
with
cultural
development
the
means
of
production
change
their
form
crude
paleoliths
are
replaced
by
sharpened
tools
stone
implements
by
elegant
bronze
and
iron
the
artisan
tool
by
machinery
yet
though
the
means
of
production
and
the
social
organisation
of
the
productive
process
continually
change
their
form
society
already
possesses
for
its
labour
process
a
certain
amount
of
past
labour
serving
as
the
basis
for
annual
reproduction
under
capitalist
methods
of
production
past
labour
of
society
preserved
in
the
means
of
production
takes
the
form
of
capital
and
the
question
of
the
origin
of
this
past
labour
which
forms
the
foundation
of
the
reproductive
process
becomes
the
question
of
the
genesis
of
capital
this
is
much
less
legendary
indeed
it
is
writ
in
letters
of
blood
in
modern
history
the
very
fact
however
that
we
can
not
think
of
simple
reproduction
unless
we
assume
a
hoard
of
past
labour
surpassing
in
volume
the
labour
annually
performed
for
the
maintenance
of
society
touches
the
sore
spot
of
simple
reproduction
and
it
shows
that
simple
reproduction
is
a
fiction
not
only
for
capitalist
production
but
also
for
the
progress
of
civilisation
in
general
if
we
merely
wish
to
understand
this
fiction
properly
and
to
reduce
it
to
a
scheme
we
must
presume
as
its
qua
results
of
a
past
productive
process
which
can
not
possibly
be
restricted
to
simple
reproduction
but
inexorably
points
towards
enlarged
reproduction
by
way
of
illustration
we
might
compare
the
aggregate
fixed
capital
of
society
with
a
railway
the
durability
and
consequently
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
its
various
parts
is
very
different
parts
such
as
viaducts
and
tunnels
may
last
for
centuries
steam
engines
for
decades
but
other
rolling
stock
will
be
used
up
in
a
short
time
in
some
instances
in
a
few
months
yet
it
is
possible
to
work
out
an
average
rate
of
wear
and
tear
say
thirty
years
so
that
the
value
of
the
whole
is
annually
depreciated
by
one
thirtieth
this
loss
of
value
is
now
continually
made
good
by
partial
reproduction
of
the
railway
which
may
count
as
repairs
so
that
a
coach
is
renewed
part
of
the
engine
and
a
section
of
sleepers
the
day
after
on
our
assumption
then
the
old
railway
is
replaced
by
a
new
one
after
thirty
years
a
similar
amount
of
labour
being
performed
each
year
by
the
society
so
that
simple
reproduction
takes
place
but
the
railway
can
only
be
reproduced
in
this
manner
it
can
not
be
so
produced
in
order
to
make
it
fit
for
use
and
to
make
good
its
gradual
wear
and
tear
the
railway
must
have
been
completed
in
the
first
place
though
the
railway
can
be
repaired
in
parts
it
can
not
be
made
fit
for
use
piecemeal
an
axle
and
a
coach
indeed
the
very
essence
of
fixed
capital
is
always
to
enter
into
the
productive
process
in
its
entirety
as
a
material
in
order
to
get
this
ready
in
the
first
place
society
must
apply
a
more
concentrated
amount
of
labour
to
its
manufacture
in
terms
of
our
example
the
labour
of
thirty
years
that
is
used
for
repairs
must
be
compressed
into
say
two
or
three
years
during
this
period
of
manufacture
society
must
therefore
expend
an
amount
of
labour
far
greater
than
the
average
that
is
to
say
it
must
have
recourse
to
expanding
reproduction
later
when
the
railway
is
finished
it
may
return
to
simple
reproduction
though
we
need
not
visualise
the
aggregate
fixed
capital
as
a
single
coherent
or
a
conglomeration
of
objects
which
must
be
produced
all
at
once
the
manufacture
of
all
the
more
important
means
of
production
such
as
buildings
transport
facilities
and
agricultural
structures
requires
a
more
concentrated
application
of
labour
and
this
is
true
for
the
modern
railway
or
steamship
as
much
as
it
was
for
the
rough
and
the
handmill
therefore
it
is
only
in
theory
that
simple
reproduction
can
be
conceived
as
alternating
with
enlarged
reproduction
the
latter
is
not
only
a
general
condition
of
a
progressive
civilisation
and
an
expanding
population
but
also
the
qua
for
the
economic
form
of
fixed
capital
or
those
means
of
production
which
in
every
society
correspond
to
the
fixed
capital
marx
deals
with
this
conflict
between
the
formation
of
fixed
capital
and
simple
reproduction
but
indirectly
in
connection
with
fluctuations
in
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
fixed
capital
more
rapid
in
some
years
than
in
others
here
he
emphasises
the
need
for
perpetual
enlarged
reproduction
since
a
strict
policy
of
simple
reproduction
would
periodically
lead
to
reproductive
losses
in
short
he
regards
enlarged
reproduction
under
the
aspect
of
an
insurance
fund
for
the
fixed
capital
of
the
society
rather
than
in
the
light
of
the
actual
productive
process
in
quite
a
different
context
marx
appears
to
endorse
the
opinion
expressed
above
in
on
the
surplus
vol
ii
part
analysing
the
conversion
of
revenue
into
capital
he
speaks
of
the
peculiar
reproduction
of
the
fixed
capital
the
replacement
of
which
in
itself
already
provides
a
fund
for
accumulation
he
draws
the
following
conclusion
point
we
have
in
mind
is
as
follows
even
if
the
aggregate
capital
employed
in
machine
manufacture
were
just
large
enough
to
make
good
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
the
machines
many
more
machines
could
be
annually
produced
than
are
required
since
the
wear
and
tear
is
in
parts
merely
and
must
be
made
good
only
after
a
certain
number
of
years
capital
so
employed
supplies
each
year
a
mass
of
machinery
which
becomes
available
for
and
anticipates
new
capital
investments
let
us
suppose
for
instance
a
machine
manufacturer
who
starts
production
this
year
during
this
year
he
supplies
machines
for
if
he
were
merely
to
reproduce
the
machines
he
has
manufactured
he
would
have
to
produce
during
the
subsequent
eleven
years
machines
for
only
and
even
then
a
year
production
would
not
be
consumed
within
the
year
still
less
could
it
be
consumed
if
he
were
to
employ
the
whole
of
his
capital
to
keep
this
capital
working
to
keep
it
reproducing
itself
every
year
a
new
and
continuous
expansion
of
the
branches
of
manufacture
that
require
these
machines
is
indispensable
this
applies
even
more
if
the
machine
manufacturer
himself
accumulates
in
consequence
even
the
capital
invested
in
one
particular
branch
of
production
is
simply
being
a
continuous
accumulation
in
the
other
branches
of
production
must
go
with
it
we
might
take
the
machine
manufacturer
of
marx
example
as
illustrating
the
production
of
fixed
capital
then
the
inference
is
that
if
society
maintains
simple
reproduction
in
this
sphere
employing
each
year
a
similar
amount
of
labour
for
the
production
of
fixed
capital
a
procedure
which
is
of
course
impossible
in
practical
life
then
annual
production
in
all
other
spheres
must
expand
but
if
here
too
simple
reproduction
is
to
be
maintained
then
if
the
fixed
capital
once
created
is
to
be
merely
renewed
only
a
small
part
of
the
labour
employed
in
its
creation
can
be
expended
or
to
put
it
the
other
way
round
if
society
is
to
provide
for
investment
in
fixed
capital
on
a
large
scale
it
must
even
assuming
simple
reproduction
to
prevail
on
the
whole
resort
periodically
to
enlarged
reproduction
with
the
advance
of
civilisation
there
are
changes
not
only
in
the
form
of
the
means
of
production
but
also
in
the
quantity
of
value
they
represent
or
better
changes
in
the
social
labour
stored
up
in
them
apart
from
the
labour
necessary
for
its
immediate
preservation
society
has
increasingly
more
labour
time
and
labour
power
to
spare
and
it
makes
use
of
these
for
the
manufacture
of
means
of
production
on
an
ever
increasing
scale
how
does
this
affect
the
process
of
reproduction
how
in
terms
of
capitalism
does
society
create
out
of
its
annual
labour
a
amount
of
capital
than
it
formerly
possessed
this
question
touches
upon
enlarged
reproduction
and
it
is
not
yet
time
to
deal
with
it
footnotes
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
we
shall
follow
general
usage
and
speak
here
and
in
the
following
of
annual
production
though
this
term
strictly
speaking
applies
in
general
to
agriculture
only
the
periods
of
industrial
production
or
of
the
turnover
of
capitals
need
not
coincide
with
calendar
years
the
distinction
between
intellectual
and
material
labour
need
not
involve
special
categories
of
the
population
in
a
planned
society
based
on
common
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
it
will
always
find
expression
in
the
existence
of
a
certain
number
of
spiritual
leaders
who
must
be
materially
maintained
the
same
individuals
may
exercise
these
various
functions
at
different
times

the
circulation
of
money
in
our
study
of
the
reproductive
process
we
have
not
so
far
considered
the
circulation
of
money
here
we
do
not
refer
to
money
as
a
measuring
rod
an
embodiment
of
value
because
all
relations
of
social
labour
have
been
expressed
assumed
and
measured
in
terms
of
money
what
we
have
to
do
now
is
to
test
our
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
under
the
aspect
of
money
as
a
means
of
exchange
quesnay
already
saw
that
we
shall
only
understand
the
social
reproductive
process
if
we
assume
side
by
side
with
the
means
of
production
and
consumer
goods
a
certain
quantity
of
money
two
questions
now
arise
by
whom
should
the
money
be
owned
and
how
much
of
it
should
there
be
the
answer
to
the
first
question
no
doubt
is
that
the
workers
receive
their
wages
in
the
form
of
money
with
which
they
buy
consumer
goods
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
this
means
merely
that
the
workers
are
allocated
a
certain
share
of
the
fund
for
consumption
every
society
whatever
its
historical
form
of
production
makes
such
allocations
to
its
workers
it
is
however
an
essential
characteristic
of
the
capitalist
form
of
production
that
the
workers
do
not
obtain
their
share
directly
in
the
form
of
goods
but
by
way
of
commodity
exchange
just
as
it
is
an
essential
feature
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
that
their
labour
power
is
not
applied
directly
as
a
result
of
a
relation
of
personal
domination
but
again
by
way
of
commodity
exchange
the
workers
selling
their
labour
power
to
the
owners
of
the
means
of
production
and
purchasing
freely
their
consumer
goods
variable
capital
in
its
money
form
is
the
expression
and
medium
of
both
these
transactions
money
then
comes
first
into
circulation
by
the
payment
of
wages
the
capitalist
class
must
therefore
set
a
certain
quantity
of
money
circulating
in
the
first
place
and
this
must
be
equal
to
the
amount
they
pay
in
wages
the
capitalists
of
department
i
need
units
of
money
and
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
need
to
meet
their
wages
bill
thus
according
to
our
diagram
two
quantities
of
money
are
circulating
i
and
ii
the
workers
spend
the
total
of
on
consumer
goods
on
the
products
of
department
ii
in
this
way
labour
power
is
maintained
that
is
to
say
the
variable
capital
of
society
is
reproduced
in
its
natural
form
as
the
foundation
of
all
other
reproductions
of
capital
at
the
same
time
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
dispose
of
their
aggregate
product
in
the
following
manner
their
own
workers
receive
and
the
workers
of
department
i
receive
this
exchange
gives
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
possession
of
money
units
are
their
own
variable
capital
which
has
returned
to
them
these
may
start
circulating
again
as
variable
capital
but
for
the
time
being
they
have
completed
their
course
the
other
accrue
to
them
year
by
year
out
of
the
realisation
of
of
their
own
products
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
now
buy
means
of
production
from
the
capitalists
of
department
i
for
these
money
units
in
order
to
renew
the
part
of
their
own
constant
capital
that
has
been
used
up
by
means
of
this
purchase
department
ii
renews
in
its
natural
form
half
of
the
constant
capital
it
requires
department
i
now
has
in
return
money
units
which
are
nothing
more
than
the
money
originally
paid
to
its
own
workers
now
after
having
changed
hands
twice
the
money
has
returned
to
department
i
to
become
effective
later
as
variable
capital
this
completes
the
circulation
of
this
quantity
of
money
for
the
moment
but
the
circulation
within
society
has
not
yet
come
to
an
end
the
capitalists
of
department
i
have
not
yet
realised
their
surplus
value
to
buy
consumer
goods
for
themselves
it
is
still
contained
in
their
product
in
a
form
which
is
of
no
use
to
them
moreover
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
have
not
yet
renewed
the
second
half
of
their
constant
capital
these
two
acts
of
exchange
are
identical
both
in
substance
and
in
value
for
the
capitalists
of
department
i
receive
their
goods
from
department
ii
in
exchange
for
the
i
means
of
production
needed
by
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
however
a
new
quantity
of
money
is
required
to
effect
this
exchange
it
is
true
that
the
same
money
which
has
already
completed
its
course
might
be
brought
into
circulation
again
for
this
purpose
in
theory
there
could
be
no
objection
to
this
in
practice
however
this
solution
is
out
of
the
question
for
the
needs
of
the
capitalists
as
consumers
must
be
satisfied
just
as
constantly
as
the
needs
of
the
workers
they
run
parallel
to
the
process
of
production
and
must
be
mediated
by
specific
quantities
of
money
hence
it
follows
that
the
capitalists
of
both
departments
that
is
to
say
all
capitalists
must
have
a
further
cash
reserve
in
hand
in
addition
to
the
money
required
as
variable
capital
in
order
to
realise
their
own
surplus
value
in
the
form
of
consumer
goods
on
the
other
hand
before
the
total
product
is
realised
and
during
the
process
of
its
production
certain
parts
of
the
constant
capital
must
be
bought
continually
these
are
the
circulating
parts
of
the
constant
capital
such
as
raw
and
auxiliary
materials
goods
lighting
and
the
like
therefore
not
only
must
the
capitalists
of
department
i
have
certain
quantities
of
money
in
hand
to
satisfy
their
needs
as
consumers
but
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
must
also
have
money
to
meet
the
requirements
of
their
constant
capital
the
exchange
of
i
the
surplus
value
of
department
i
contained
in
the
means
of
production
against
goods
is
thus
effected
by
money
which
is
advanced
partly
by
the
capitalists
of
department
i
in
order
to
satisfy
their
needs
as
consumers
and
partly
by
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
in
order
to
satisfy
their
needs
as
producers
both
lots
of
capitalists
may
each
advance
units
of
the
money
necessary
for
the
exchange
or
possibly
the
two
departments
will
contribute
in
different
proportions
at
any
rate
two
things
are
certain
the
money
set
aside
for
the
purpose
by
both
departments
must
suffice
to
effect
the
exchange
between
i
and
ii
whatever
the
distribution
of
this
money
between
the
two
departments
may
have
been
the
exchange
transaction
completed
each
department
of
capitalist
production
must
again
possess
the
same
amount
of
money
it
had
earlier
put
into
circulation
this
latter
maxim
applies
quite
generally
to
social
circulation
as
a
whole
once
the
process
of
circulation
is
concluded
money
will
always
have
returned
to
its
point
of
origin
thus
all
capitalists
after
universal
exchange
have
achieved
a
twofold
result
first
they
have
exchanged
products
which
in
their
natural
form
were
of
no
use
to
them
against
other
products
which
in
their
natural
form
the
capitalists
require
either
as
means
of
production
or
for
their
own
consumption
secondly
they
have
regained
possession
of
the
money
which
they
set
in
circulation
so
as
to
effect
these
acts
of
exchange
this
phenomenon
is
unintelligible
from
the
point
of
view
of
simple
commodity
circulation
where
commodity
and
money
continually
change
places
possession
of
the
commodity
excluding
the
possession
of
money
as
money
constantly
usurps
the
place
which
the
commodity
has
given
up
and
indeed
this
is
perfectly
true
with
regard
to
every
individual
act
of
commodity
exchange
which
is
the
form
of
social
circulation
yet
this
social
circulation
itself
is
more
than
mere
exchange
of
commodities
it
is
the
circulation
of
capital
it
is
however
an
essential
and
characteristic
feature
of
this
kind
of
circulation
that
it
does
not
only
return
to
the
capitalist
the
value
of
his
original
capital
plus
an
increase
the
surplus
value
but
that
it
also
assists
social
reproduction
by
providing
the
means
of
production
and
labour
power
in
the
natural
form
of
productive
capital
and
by
ensuring
the
maintenance
of
those
who
do
not
work
possessing
both
the
means
of
production
and
the
money
needed
the
capitalists
start
the
total
social
process
of
circulation
as
soon
as
the
social
capital
has
completed
its
circuit
everything
is
again
in
their
hands
apportioned
to
each
department
according
to
the
investments
made
by
it
the
workers
have
only
temporary
possession
of
money
during
which
time
they
convert
the
variable
capital
from
its
money
form
into
its
natural
form
the
variable
capital
in
the
capitalists
hands
is
nothing
but
the
outward
shape
of
part
of
their
capital
and
for
this
reason
it
must
always
revert
to
them
so
far
we
have
only
considered
circulation
as
it
takes
place
between
the
two
large
departments
of
production
yet
units
of
the
first
department
produce
remain
there
in
the
form
of
means
of
production
to
renew
its
constant
capital
of
moreover
of
the
consumer
goods
produced
in
department
ii
corresponding
to
the
surplus
value
ii
also
remain
in
this
department
in
the
form
of
consumer
goods
for
the
capitalist
class
since
in
both
departments
the
mode
of
production
is
capitalistic
that
is
unplanned
private
production
each
department
can
distribute
its
own
products
means
of
production
in
department
i
and
consumer
goods
in
department
ii
amongst
its
own
capitalists
only
by
way
of
commodity
exchange
by
a
large
number
of
individual
sale
transactions
between
capitalists
of
the
same
department
therefore
the
capitalists
of
both
departments
must
have
a
reserve
of
money
with
which
to
perform
these
exchange
transactions
to
renew
both
the
means
of
production
in
department
i
and
the
consumer
goods
for
the
capitalist
class
in
department
ii
this
part
of
circulation
does
not
present
any
features
of
specific
interest
as
it
is
merely
simple
commodity
circulation
vendor
and
purchaser
alike
belong
to
the
same
category
of
agents
of
production
and
circulation
is
concerned
only
with
money
and
commodity
changing
hands
within
the
same
class
and
department
all
the
same
the
money
needed
for
this
circulation
must
from
the
outset
be
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalist
class
it
is
part
of
their
capital
so
far
the
circulation
of
total
social
capital
presents
no
peculiarities
even
if
we
consider
the
circulation
of
money
from
the
very
outset
it
is
that
society
must
possess
a
certain
quantity
of
money
to
make
this
circulation
possible
and
this
for
two
reasons
first
the
general
form
of
capitalist
production
is
that
of
commodity
production
which
implies
the
circulation
of
money
secondly
the
circulation
of
capital
is
based
upon
the
continuous
alternation
of
the
three
forms
of
capital
money
capital
productive
capital
and
commodity
capital
and
as
it
is
this
very
money
finally
which
operates
as
capital
our
diagram
referring
to
capitalist
production
exclusively
the
capitalist
class
must
have
possession
of
this
money
as
it
has
possession
of
every
other
form
of
capital
it
throws
it
into
circulation
in
order
to
regain
possession
as
soon
as
the
process
of
circulation
has
been
completed
at
first
glance
only
one
detail
might
strike
us
if
the
capitalists
themselves
have
set
in
motion
all
the
money
which
circulates
in
society
they
must
also
advance
the
money
needed
for
the
realisation
of
their
own
surplus
value
thus
it
seems
that
the
capitalists
as
a
class
ought
to
buy
their
own
surplus
value
with
their
own
money
as
the
capitalist
class
has
possession
of
this
money
resulting
from
previous
periods
of
production
even
prior
to
the
realisation
of
the
product
of
each
working
period
the
appropriation
of
surplus
value
at
first
sight
does
not
seem
to
be
based
upon
the
unpaid
labour
of
the
wage
labourer
as
it
in
fact
is
but
merely
the
result
of
an
exchange
of
commodities
against
an
equivalent
quantity
of
money
both
supplied
by
the
capitalist
class
itself
a
little
reflection
however
dispels
this
illusion
after
the
general
completion
of
circulation
the
capitalists
now
as
before
possess
their
money
funds
which
either
reverted
to
them
or
remained
in
their
hands
further
they
acquired
consumer
goods
for
the
same
amount
which
they
have
consumed
note
that
we
are
still
confining
ourselves
to
simple
reproduction
as
the
prime
condition
of
our
diagram
of
reproduction
the
renewal
of
production
on
the
old
scale
and
the
use
of
all
surplus
value
produced
for
the
personal
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
moreover
the
illusion
vanishes
completely
if
we
do
not
confine
ourselves
to
one
period
of
production
but
observe
a
number
of
successive
periods
in
their
mutual
interconnections
the
value
the
capitalist
puts
into
circulation
in
the
form
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
realising
his
own
surplus
value
is
in
fact
nothing
but
his
surplus
value
resulting
from
the
preceding
period
of
production
in
form
of
money
the
capitalist
must
advance
money
out
of
his
own
pocket
in
order
to
buy
his
goods
for
consumption
on
the
one
hand
the
surplus
value
which
he
produces
each
year
either
exists
in
a
natural
form
which
renders
it
unfit
for
consumption
or
if
it
takes
a
consumable
form
it
is
temporarily
in
the
hands
of
another
person
on
the
other
hand
he
the
capitalist
has
regained
possession
of
the
money
and
he
is
now
making
his
advances
by
realising
his
surplus
value
from
the
preceding
period
as
soon
as
he
has
realised
his
new
surplus
value
which
is
still
embodied
in
the
this
money
will
return
to
him
consequently
in
the
course
of
several
periods
of
production
the
capitalist
class
draws
its
consumer
goods
from
the
pool
as
well
as
the
other
natural
forms
of
its
capital
the
quantity
of
money
originally
in
its
possession
however
remains
unaffected
by
this
process
investigation
of
the
circulation
of
money
in
society
shows
that
the
individual
capitalist
can
never
invest
the
whole
of
his
money
capital
in
production
but
must
always
keep
a
certain
money
reserve
to
be
employed
as
variable
capital
as
wages
further
he
must
keep
a
capital
reserve
for
the
purchase
of
means
of
production
at
any
given
period
and
in
addition
he
must
have
a
cash
reserve
for
his
personal
consumption
the
process
of
reproducing
the
total
social
capital
thus
entails
the
necessity
of
producing
and
reproducing
the
substance
of
money
money
is
also
capital
for
marx
diagram
which
we
have
discussed
before
conceives
of
no
other
than
capitalist
production
thus
the
diagram
seems
incomplete
we
ought
to
add
a
further
department
that
of
production
of
the
means
of
exchange
to
the
other
two
large
departments
of
social
production
those
of
means
of
production
i
and
of
consumer
goods
ii
it
is
indeed
a
characteristic
feature
of
this
third
department
that
it
serves
neither
the
purposes
of
production
nor
those
of
consumption
merely
representing
social
labour
in
an
undifferentiated
commodity
that
can
not
be
used
though
money
and
its
production
like
the
exchange
and
production
of
commodities
are
much
older
than
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
it
was
only
the
latter
which
made
the
circulation
of
money
a
general
form
of
social
circulation
and
thus
the
essential
element
of
the
social
reproductive
process
we
can
only
obtain
a
comprehensive
diagram
of
the
essential
points
of
capitalist
production
if
we
demonstrate
the
original
relationship
between
the
production
and
reproduction
of
money
and
the
two
other
departments
of
social
production
here
however
we
deviate
from
marx
he
included
the
production
of
gold
we
have
reduced
the
total
production
of
money
to
the
production
of
gold
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
in
the
first
department
of
social
production
production
of
gold
like
that
of
metals
generally
belongs
to
department
i
which
occupies
itself
with
means
of
production
this
is
correct
only
in
so
far
as
the
production
of
gold
is
the
production
of
metal
for
industrial
purposes
jewellery
dental
stoppings
but
gold
in
its
capacity
as
money
is
not
a
metal
but
rather
an
embodiment
of
social
labour
thus
it
is
no
more
a
means
of
production
than
it
is
a
consumer
good
besides
a
mere
glance
at
the
diagram
of
reproduction
itself
shows
what
inconsistencies
must
result
from
confusing
means
of
exchange
with
means
of
production
if
we
add
a
diagrammatic
representation
of
the
annual
production
of
gold
as
the
substance
of
money
to
the
two
departments
of
social
production
we
get
the
following
three
sets
of
figures
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
iii
means
of
exchange
this
quantity
of
value
of
chosen
by
marx
as
an
example
obviously
does
not
represent
the
quantity
of
money
which
circulates
annually
in
society
it
only
stands
for
that
part
which
is
annually
reproduced
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
the
money
substance
which
on
the
average
remains
constant
so
long
as
social
reproduction
remains
on
the
same
level
the
turnover
of
capital
goes
on
in
a
regular
manner
and
the
realisation
of
commodities
proceeds
at
an
equal
pace
if
we
consider
the
third
line
as
an
integral
part
of
the
first
one
as
marx
wants
us
to
do
the
following
difficulty
arises
the
constant
capital
of
the
third
department
consists
of
real
and
concrete
means
of
production
premises
tools
auxiliary
materials
vessels
and
the
like
just
as
it
does
in
the
two
other
departments
its
product
however
the
which
represent
money
can
not
operate
in
its
natural
form
as
constant
capital
in
any
process
of
production
if
we
therefore
include
this
as
an
essential
part
of
the
product
of
department
i
means
of
production
the
means
of
production
will
show
a
social
deficit
of
this
size
which
will
prevent
departments
i
and
ii
from
resuming
their
reproduction
on
the
old
scale
according
to
the
previous
assumption
which
forms
the
foundation
of
marx
whole
diagram
reproduction
as
a
whole
starts
from
the
product
of
each
department
in
its
actual
the
proportions
of
the
diagram
are
based
upon
this
assumption
without
it
they
dissolve
in
chaos
thus
the
first
fundamental
relation
of
value
is
based
upon
the
equation
i
equals
i
ii
this
can
not
apply
to
the
product
iii
since
neither
department
can
use
gold
as
a
means
of
production
say
in
the
proportion
of
i
ii
the
second
fundamental
relation
derived
from
this
is
based
upon
the
equation
i
i
ii
this
would
mean
with
regard
to
the
production
of
gold
that
as
many
consumer
goods
are
taken
from
department
ii
as
there
are
means
of
production
supplied
to
it
but
this
is
equally
untrue
though
the
production
of
gold
removes
concrete
means
of
production
from
the
total
social
product
and
uses
them
as
its
constant
capital
though
it
takes
concrete
consumer
goods
for
the
use
of
its
workers
and
capitalists
corresponding
to
its
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
the
product
it
supplies
yet
can
not
operate
in
any
branch
of
production
as
a
means
of
production
nor
is
it
a
consumer
good
fit
for
human
consumption
to
include
the
production
of
money
in
the
activities
of
department
i
therefore
is
to
run
counter
to
all
the
general
proportions
which
express
the
relations
of
value
in
diagram
and
to
diminish
the
diagram
validity
the
attempt
by
marx
to
find
room
for
the
production
of
gold
within
department
i
means
of
production
moreover
leads
to
dubious
results
the
first
act
of
circulation
between
this
new
called
by
marx
and
department
ii
consumer
goods
consists
as
usual
in
the
workers
purchase
of
consumer
goods
from
department
ii
with
the
money
obtained
as
wages
from
the
capitalists
this
money
is
not
yet
a
product
of
the
new
period
of
production
it
has
been
reserved
by
the
capitalists
of
department
out
of
the
money
contained
in
their
product
of
an
earlier
period
this
indeed
is
the
normal
procedure
but
now
marx
allows
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
to
buy
gold
from
with
the
money
they
have
reserved
gold
as
a
commodity
material
to
the
value
of
this
is
a
leap
from
the
production
of
money
into
the
industrial
production
of
gold
which
is
no
more
to
do
with
the
problem
of
the
production
of
money
than
with
the
production
of
yet
out
of
the
that
have
been
reserved
still
remain
and
as
the
capitalist
unable
to
use
them
as
constant
capital
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
marx
arranges
for
him
to
add
them
on
to
his
own
reserve
of
money
marx
further
finds
the
following
way
out
to
avoid
a
deficit
in
the
constant
capital
of
ii
which
must
be
exchanged
completely
against
the
means
of
production
this
money
must
be
entirely
transferred
from
to
no
matter
whether
it
exists
in
necessities
of
life
or
articles
of
luxury
and
vice
versa
a
corresponding
value
of
commodities
must
be
transferred
from
to
result
a
portion
of
the
is
accumulated
as
a
hoard
of
money
a
strange
result
in
all
conscience
we
have
achieved
an
increase
in
money
a
surplus
of
the
money
substance
by
simply
confining
ourselves
to
the
annual
wear
and
tear
of
the
money
fund
this
surplus
value
comes
into
existence
for
some
unknown
reason
at
the
expense
of
the
capitalists
in
the
consumer
goods
department
they
practise
abstinence
not
because
they
may
want
to
expand
their
production
of
surplus
value
let
us
say
but
in
order
to
secure
a
sufficient
quantity
of
consumer
goods
for
the
workers
engaged
in
the
production
of
gold
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
however
get
poor
reward
for
this
christian
virtue
in
spite
of
their
abstinence
they
are
not
only
unable
to
expand
their
reproduction
but
they
are
no
longer
even
in
the
position
to
resume
their
production
on
its
former
scale
even
if
the
corresponding
value
is
transferred
from
to
it
is
not
only
the
value
but
its
actual
and
concrete
form
which
matters
as
the
new
part
of
the
product
of
i
now
consists
of
money
which
can
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
production
department
ii
in
spite
of
its
abstinence
can
not
renew
its
constant
material
capital
on
the
old
scale
as
our
diagram
presupposes
simple
reproduction
its
condition
are
thus
violated
in
two
directions
surplus
value
is
being
hoarded
and
the
constant
capital
shows
a
deficit
marx
own
results
then
prove
that
the
production
of
gold
can
not
possibly
find
a
place
in
either
of
the
two
departments
of
his
diagram
the
whole
diagram
is
upset
as
soon
as
the
first
act
of
exchange
between
departments
i
and
ii
has
been
completed
as
engels
remarks
in
his
footnote
analysis
of
the
exchange
of
newly
produced
gold
within
the
constant
capital
of
department
i
is
not
contained
in
the
besides
the
inconsistency
would
then
only
have
been
greater
the
point
of
view
we
advocate
is
confirmed
by
marx
himself
when
he
gives
an
exhaustive
answer
to
the
question
as
striking
as
it
is
brief
in
itself
is
not
an
element
of
actual
reproduction
there
is
another
important
reason
why
we
should
put
the
production
of
money
in
a
third
and
separate
department
of
social
production
as
a
whole
marx
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
is
valid
as
the
and
foundation
of
the
reproductive
process
not
only
for
capitalism
but
also
for
every
regulated
and
planned
economic
order
for
instance
a
socialist
one
however
the
production
of
money
just
like
the
of
the
products
becomes
obsolete
when
private
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
is
abolished
it
constitutes
the
liabilities
the
of
the
anarchic
economy
under
capitalism
a
peculiar
burden
for
a
society
based
upon
private
enterprise
which
implies
the
annual
expenditure
of
a
considerable
amount
of
labour
on
the
manufacture
of
products
which
are
neither
means
of
production
nor
yet
consumer
goods
this
peculiar
expenditure
of
labour
by
a
society
producing
under
capitalism
will
vanish
in
a
socially
planned
economy
it
is
most
adequately
demonstrated
by
means
of
a
separate
department
within
the
process
of
reproducing
social
capital
it
is
quite
immaterial
in
this
connection
whether
we
picture
a
country
which
produces
its
own
gold
or
a
country
which
imports
gold
from
abroad
the
same
expenditure
of
social
labour
which
in
the
first
case
is
necessary
for
the
direct
production
of
gold
is
required
in
the
second
case
to
effect
the
exchange
transactions
these
observations
show
that
the
problem
of
the
reproduction
of
total
capital
is
not
so
crude
as
it
often
appears
to
those
who
approach
it
merely
from
the
point
of
view
of
crises
the
central
problem
might
be
formulated
as
follows
how
is
it
possible
that
in
an
unplanned
economy
the
aggregate
production
of
innumerable
individual
capitalists
can
satisfy
all
the
needs
of
society
one
answer
that
suggests
itself
points
to
the
continual
fluctuations
in
the
level
of
production
in
accordance
with
the
fluctuating
demand
the
periodical
changes
in
the
market
this
point
of
view
which
regards
the
aggregate
product
of
society
as
an
undifferentiated
mass
of
commodities
and
treats
social
demand
in
an
equally
absurd
way
overlooks
the
most
important
element
the
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
we
have
seen
that
the
problem
of
capitalist
reproduction
contains
quite
a
number
of
precisely
defined
relations
referring
to
specific
capitalist
categories
and
also
to
the
general
categories
of
human
labour
the
real
problem
consists
in
their
inherent
tendencies
towards
both
conflict
and
harmony
marx
diagram
is
the
scientific
formulation
of
the
problem
inquiry
must
now
be
made
into
the
implications
of
this
diagram
analytic
of
the
process
of
production
has
it
any
real
bearing
on
the
problems
of
actual
life
according
to
the
diagram
circulation
absorbs
the
entire
social
product
all
consumers
needs
are
satisfied
and
reproduction
takes
place
without
friction
the
circulation
of
money
succeeds
the
circulation
of
commodities
completing
the
cycle
of
social
capital
but
what
is
the
position
in
real
life
the
relations
outlined
in
the
diagram
lay
down
a
precise
first
principle
for
the
division
of
social
labour
in
a
planned
production
always
providing
a
system
of
simple
reproduction
no
changes
in
the
volume
of
production
but
no
such
planned
organisation
of
the
total
process
exists
in
a
capitalist
economy
and
things
do
not
run
smoothly
along
a
mathematical
formula
as
suggested
by
the
diagram
on
the
contrary
the
course
of
reproduction
shows
continual
deviations
from
the
proportions
of
the
diagram
which
become
manifest
in
the
fluctuations
of
prices
from
day
to
day
in
the
continual
fluctuations
of
profits
in
the
ceaseless
flow
of
capital
from
one
branch
of
production
to
another
and
finally
in
the
periodical
and
cyclical
swings
of
reproduction
between
and
crisis
and
yet
apart
from
all
these
deviations
the
diagram
presents
a
socially
necessary
average
level
in
which
all
these
movements
must
centre
to
which
they
are
always
striving
to
return
once
they
have
left
it
that
is
why
the
fluctuating
movements
of
the
individual
capitalists
do
not
degenerate
into
chaos
but
are
reduced
to
a
certain
order
which
ensures
the
prolonged
existence
of
society
in
spite
of
its
lack
of
a
plan
in
comparison
the
similarities
and
the
profound
discrepancies
between
marx
diagram
of
reproduction
and
quesnay
strike
us
at
once
these
two
diagrams
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
period
of
classical
economics
are
the
only
attempts
to
describe
an
apparent
chaos
in
precise
terms
a
chaos
created
by
the
interrelated
movements
of
capitalist
production
and
consumption
and
by
the
disparity
of
innumerable
private
producers
and
consumers
both
writers
reduce
this
chaotic
jumble
of
individual
capitals
to
a
few
broadly
conceived
rules
which
serve
as
it
were
as
moorings
for
the
development
of
capitalist
society
in
spite
of
its
chaos
they
both
achieve
a
synthesis
between
the
two
aspects
which
are
the
basis
of
the
whole
movement
of
social
capital
that
circulation
is
at
one
and
the
same
time
a
capitalist
process
of
producing
and
appropriating
surplus
value
and
also
a
social
process
of
producing
and
consuming
material
goods
necessary
to
civilised
human
existence
both
show
the
circulation
of
commodities
to
act
as
a
mediator
for
the
social
process
as
a
whole
and
both
conceive
of
the
circulation
of
money
as
a
subsidiary
phenomenon
an
external
and
superficial
expression
of
the
various
stages
within
the
circulation
of
commodities
it
is
socially
necessary
labour
which
creates
value
this
inspired
fundamental
law
of
marx
theory
of
value
which
provided
the
solution
of
the
money
problem
amongst
others
further
led
him
first
to
distinguish
and
then
to
integrate
those
two
aspects
in
the
total
reproductive
process
the
aspect
of
value
and
that
of
actual
material
connections
secondly
marx
diagram
is
based
upon
the
precise
distinction
between
constant
and
variable
capital
which
alone
reveals
the
internal
mechanisms
of
the
production
of
surplus
value
and
brings
it
as
a
into
precise
relation
with
the
two
material
categories
of
production
that
of
producer
and
consumer
goods
after
quesnay
some
classical
economists
adam
smith
and
ricardo
in
particular
came
fairly
close
to
this
point
of
view
contribution
his
precise
elaboration
of
the
theory
of
value
has
even
been
frequently
confused
with
that
of
marx
on
the
basis
of
his
own
theory
of
value
ricardo
saw
that
smith
method
of
resolving
the
price
of
all
commodities
into
a
theory
which
wrought
so
much
havoc
in
the
analysis
of
reproduction
is
wrong
but
he
was
not
much
interested
in
smith
mistake
nor
indeed
very
enthusiastic
about
the
problem
of
reproduction
as
a
whole
his
analysis
in
fact
represents
a
certain
decline
after
that
of
adam
smith
just
as
smith
had
partly
retrogressed
as
against
the
physiocrats
if
ricardo
expounded
the
fundamental
value
categories
of
bourgeois
economy
wages
surplus
value
and
capital
much
more
precisely
and
consistently
than
his
predecessors
he
also
treated
them
more
rigidly
adam
smith
had
shown
infinitely
more
understanding
for
the
living
connections
the
broad
movements
of
the
whole
in
consequence
he
did
not
mind
giving
two
or
as
in
the
case
of
the
problem
of
value
even
three
or
four
different
answers
to
the
same
question
though
he
contradicts
himself
quite
cheerfully
in
the
various
parts
of
his
analysis
these
very
contradictions
are
ever
stimulating
him
to
renewed
effort
they
make
him
approach
the
problem
as
a
whole
from
an
ever
different
point
of
view
and
so
to
grasp
its
dynamics
ultimately
it
was
the
limitation
of
their
bourgeois
mentalities
which
doomed
both
smith
and
ricardo
to
failure
a
proper
understanding
of
the
fundamental
categories
of
capitalist
production
of
value
and
surplus
value
as
living
dynamics
of
the
social
process
demands
the
understanding
of
this
process
in
its
historical
development
and
of
the
categories
themselves
as
historically
conditioned
forms
of
the
general
relations
of
labour
this
means
that
only
a
socialist
can
really
solve
the
problem
of
the
reproduction
of
capital
between
the
and
the
diagram
of
reproduction
in
the
second
volume
of
there
lies
the
prosperity
and
decline
of
bourgeois
economics
both
in
time
and
in
substance
footnotes
in
his
seventh
note
to
the
following
up
his
arguments
against
the
mercantilist
theory
of
money
as
identical
with
wealth
quesnay
says
bulk
of
money
in
a
nation
can
not
increase
unless
this
reproduction
itself
increases
otherwise
an
increase
in
the
bulk
of
money
would
inevitably
be
prejudicial
to
the
annual
production
of
wealth
therefore
we
must
not
judge
the
opulence
of
states
on
the
basis
of
a
greater
or
smaller
quantity
of
money
thus
a
stock
of
money
equal
to
the
income
of
the
landowners
is
deemed
much
more
than
enough
for
an
agricultural
nation
where
the
circulation
proceeds
in
a
regular
manner
and
where
commerce
takes
place
in
confidence
and
full

the

as
the
starting

of
this

as
engels
rightly
says
in

this
does
not
affect
the
final
result
of
circulation
but
the

is
not
the

of

within

marx
himself
has
given
a
better
exposition
in
vol
ii
pp
vol

vol

enlarged
reproduction
the
shortcomings
of
the
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
are
obvious
it
explains
the
laws
of
a
form
of
reproduction
which
is
possible
only
as
an
occasional
exception
in
a
capitalist
economy
it
is
not
simple
but
enlarged
reproduction
which
is
the
rule
in
every
capitalist
economic
system
even
more
so
than
in
any
other
nevertheless
this
diagram
is
of
real
scientific
importance
in
two
respects
in
practice
even
under
conditions
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
greater
part
of
the
social
product
can
be
looked
on
as
simple
reproduction
which
forms
the
broad
basis
upon
which
production
in
every
case
expands
beyond
its
former
limits
in
theory
the
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
also
provides
the
necessary
starting
point
for
all
scientific
exposition
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
of
the
aggregate
social
capital
therefore
inevitably
introduces
the
further
problem
of
the
enlarged
reproduction
of
the
total
capital
we
already
know
the
historical
peculiarity
of
enlarged
reproduction
on
a
capitalist
basis
it
must
represent
itself
as
accumulation
of
capital
which
is
both
its
specific
form
and
its
specific
condition
that
is
to
say
social
production
as
a
whole
which
on
a
capitalist
basis
is
the
production
of
surplus
value
can
in
every
case
be
expanded
only
in
so
far
as
the
social
capital
that
has
been
previously
active
is
now
augmented
by
surplus
value
of
its
own
creation
this
use
of
part
of
the
surplus
value
and
in
particular
the
use
of
an
increasing
part
of
it
for
the
purpose
of
production
instead
of
personal
consumption
by
the
capitalist
class
or
else
the
increase
of
reserves
is
the
basis
of
enlarged
reproduction
under
capitalist
conditions
of
production
the
characteristic
feature
of
enlarged
reproduction
of
the
aggregate
social
capital
just
as
in
our
previous
assumption
of
simple
reproduction
is
the
reproduction
of
individual
capitals
since
production
as
a
whole
whether
regarded
as
simple
or
as
enlarged
production
can
in
fact
only
occur
in
the
form
of
innumerable
independent
movements
of
reproduction
performed
by
private
individual
capitals
the
first
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
accumulation
of
individual
capitals
is
given
in
volume
i
of
marx
section
chapters
here
marx
treats
of
the
division
of
the
surplus
value
into
capital
and
revenue
the
circumstances
which
determine
the
accumulation
of
capital
apart
from
this
division
such
as
the
degree
of
exploitation
of
labour
power
and
labour
productivity
the
growth
of
fixed
capital
relative
to
the
circulating
capital
as
a
factor
of
accumulation
and
the
increasing
development
of
an
industrial
reserve
army
which
is
at
the
same
time
both
a
consequence
and
a
prerequisite
of
the
process
of
accumulation
in
the
course
of
this
discussion
marx
deals
with
two
inspired
notions
of
bourgeois
economists
with
regard
to
accumulation
the
of
abstinence
as
held
by
the
more
vulgar
economists
who
proclaim
that
the
division
of
surplus
value
into
capital
and
thus
accumulation
itself
is
an
ethical
and
heroic
act
of
the
capitalists
and
the
fallacy
of
the
classical
economists
their
doctrine
that
the
entire
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
used
solely
for
consumption
by
the
productive
workers
that
is
to
say
spent
altogether
on
wages
for
the
workers
employed
year
by
year
this
erroneous
assumption
which
completely
overlooks
the
fact
that
every
increase
of
production
must
manifest
itself
not
only
in
the
increased
number
of
employed
workers
but
also
in
the
increase
of
the
material
means
of
production
premises
tools
and
certainly
raw
materials
is
obviously
rooted
in
that
of
adam
smith
which
we
have
already
discussed
moreover
the
assumption
that
the
expenditure
of
a
greater
amount
of
capital
on
wages
is
sufficient
to
expand
production
also
results
from
the
mistaken
idea
that
the
prices
of
all
commodities
are
completely
resolved
into
wages
and
surplus
value
so
that
the
constant
capital
is
disregarded
altogether
strangely
enough
even
ricardo
who
was
at
any
rate
occasionally
aware
of
this
element
of
error
in
doctrine
subscribes
most
emphatically
to
its
ultimate
inferences
mistaken
though
they
were
must
be
understood
that
all
the
productions
of
a
country
are
consumed
but
it
makes
the
greatest
difference
imaginable
whether
they
are
consumed
by
those
who
reproduce
or
by
those
who
do
not
reproduce
another
value
when
we
say
that
revenue
is
saved
and
added
to
capital
what
we
mean
is
that
the
portion
of
revenue
so
said
to
be
added
to
capital
is
consumed
by
productive
instead
of
unproductive
labourers
if
all
the
goods
produced
are
thus
swallowed
up
by
human
consumption
there
can
clearly
be
no
room
to
spare
in
the
total
social
product
for
such
unconsumable
means
of
production
as
tools
and
machinery
new
materials
and
buildings
and
consequently
enlarged
reproduction
too
will
have
to
take
a
peculiar
course
what
happens
according
to
this
odd
conception
is
simply
that
staple
foodstuffs
for
new
workers
will
be
produced
to
the
amount
of
the
capitalised
part
of
surplus
value
instead
of
the
choice
delicacies
previously
provided
for
the
capitalist
class
the
classical
theory
of
enlarged
reproduction
does
not
admit
of
any
variations
other
than
those
connected
with
the
production
of
consumer
goods
after
our
previous
observations
it
is
not
surprising
that
marx
could
easily
dispose
of
this
elementary
mistake
of
both
ricardo
and
smith
just
as
simple
reproduction
requires
a
regulated
renewal
of
the
constant
capital
the
material
means
of
production
quite
apart
from
the
production
of
consumer
goods
in
the
necessary
quantity
for
labourer
and
capitalist
equally
so
in
the
case
of
expanding
production
must
part
of
the
new
additional
capital
be
used
to
enlarge
the
constant
capital
that
is
to
add
to
the
material
means
of
production
another
law
marx
discovered
must
also
be
applied
here
the
constant
capital
continually
overlooked
by
the
classical
economists
increases
relative
to
the
variable
capital
that
is
spent
on
wages
this
is
merely
the
capitalist
expression
of
the
general
effects
of
increasing
labour
productivity
with
technical
progress
human
labour
is
able
to
set
in
motion
ever
larger
masses
of
means
of
production
and
to
convert
them
into
goods
in
capitalist
terms
this
means
a
progressive
decrease
in
expenses
for
living
labour
in
wages
relative
to
the
expenses
for
inanimate
means
of
production
contrary
to
the
assumption
of
adam
smith
and
ricardo
enlarged
reproduction
must
not
only
start
with
the
division
of
the
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
into
constant
and
variable
capital
but
as
the
technique
of
production
advances
it
is
bound
to
allocate
in
this
division
ever
increasing
portions
to
the
constant
and
ever
diminishing
portions
to
the
variable
capital
this
continuous
qualitative
change
in
the
composition
of
capital
is
the
specific
manifestation
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
that
is
to
say
of
enlarged
reproduction
on
the
basis
of
capitalism
the
other
side
of
this
picture
of
continual
changes
in
the
relation
between
the
portions
of
constant
and
variable
capital
is
the
formation
of
a
relative
surplus
population
as
marx
called
it
that
is
to
say
that
part
of
the
working
population
which
exceeds
the
average
needs
of
capital
and
thus
becomes
redundant
this
reserve
of
unemployable
industrial
labour
taken
here
in
a
broader
sense
and
including
a
proletariat
that
is
dominated
by
merchant
capital
is
always
present
it
forms
a
necessary
prerequisite
of
the
sudden
expansion
of
production
in
times
of
boom
and
is
another
specific
condition
of
capitalist
accumulation
from
the
accumulation
of
individual
capitals
we
can
therefore
deduce
the
following
four
characteristic
phenomena
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
volume
of
enlarged
reproduction
is
independent
within
certain
limits
of
the
growth
of
capital
and
can
transcend
it
the
necessary
methods
for
achieving
this
are
increased
exploitation
of
labour
and
natural
forces
and
increased
labour
productivity
including
increased
efficiency
of
the
fixed
capital
all
real
accumulation
starts
with
that
part
of
the
surplus
value
which
is
intended
for
capitalisation
being
divided
into
constant
and
variable
capital
accumulation
as
a
social
process
is
accompanied
by
continuous
changes
in
the
relation
between
constant
and
variable
capital
whereby
that
portion
of
capital
which
is
invested
in
inanimate
means
of
production
continually
increases
as
compared
with
that
expended
on
wages
concomitant
with
the
accumulative
process
and
as
a
condition
of
the
latter
there
develops
an
industrial
reserve
army
these
characteristics
derived
from
the
reproductive
process
as
it
is
performed
by
the
individual
capitals
represent
an
enormous
step
forward
as
compared
with
the
analyses
of
bourgeois
economists
now
however
our
problem
is
to
demonstrate
the
accumulation
of
the
aggregate
capital
which
originates
from
these
movements
of
individual
capitals
and
on
the
basis
of
the
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
to
establish
the
precise
relations
between
the
aspects
of
value
prevalent
in
the
production
of
surplus
value
and
the
material
considerations
in
the
production
of
consumer
and
producer
goods
with
a
view
to
accumulation
the
essential
difference
between
enlarged
reproduction
and
simple
reproduction
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
the
latter
the
capitalist
class
and
its
consume
the
entire
surplus
value
whereas
in
the
former
a
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
set
aside
from
the
personal
consumption
of
its
owners
not
for
the
purpose
of
hoarding
but
in
order
to
increase
the
active
capital
for
capitalisation
to
make
this
possible
the
new
additional
capital
must
also
find
the
material
prerequisites
for
its
activity
forthcoming
here
the
concrete
composition
of
the
aggregate
social
product
becomes
important
marx
says
already
in
volume
i
when
he
considers
the
accumulation
of
individual
capitals
annual
production
must
in
the
first
place
furnish
all
those
objects
from
which
the
material
components
of
capital
used
up
in
the
course
of
the
year
have
to
be
replaced
deducting
these
there
remains
the
net
or
in
which
the
lies
and
of
what
does
this
consist
only
of
things
destined
to
satisfy
the
wants
and
desires
of
the
capitalist
class
things
which
consequently
enter
into
the
consumption
fund
of
the
capitalists
were
that
the
case
the
cup
of
would
be
drained
to
the
very
dregs
and
nothing
but
simple
reproduction
would
ever
take
to
accumulate
it
is
necessary
to
convert
a
portion
of
the
into
capital
but
we
can
not
except
by
a
miracle
convert
into
capital
anything
but
such
articles
as
can
be
employed
in
the
means
of
production
and
such
further
articles
as
are
suitable
for
the
sustenance
of
the
labourer
means
of
subsistence
consequently
a
part
of
the
annual
must
have
been
applied
to
the
production
of
additional
means
of
production
and
subsistence
over
and
above
the
quantity
of
these
things
required
to
replace
the
capital
advanced
in
one
word
is
convertible
into
capital
solely
because
the
whose
value
it
is
already
comprises
the
material
elements
of
new
capital
additional
means
of
production
however
and
additional
consumer
goods
for
the
workers
alone
are
not
sufficient
to
get
enlarged
reproduction
really
going
additional
labour
is
also
required
marx
now
finds
a
specific
difficulty
in
this
last
condition
this
the
mechanism
of
capitalist
production
provides
beforehand
by
converting
the
working
class
into
a
class
dependent
on
wages
a
class
whose
ordinary
wages
suffice
not
only
for
its
maintenance
but
for
its
increase
it
is
only
necessary
for
capital
to
incorporate
this
additional
annually
supplied
by
the
working
class
in
the
shape
of
labourers
of
all
ages
with
the
surplus
means
of
production
comprised
in
the
annual
produce
and
the
conversion
of
into
capital
is
complete
this
is
the
first
solution
which
marx
gave
to
the
problem
of
the
accumulation
of
the
aggregate
capital
having
dwelt
on
this
aspect
of
the
question
already
in
volume
i
of
marx
returns
to
the
problem
at
the
end
of
the
second
volume
of
his
main
work
whose
concluding
chapter
is
devoted
to
accumulation
and
enlarged
reproduction
of
the
aggregate
capital
let
us
examine
marx
diagrammatic
exposition
of
accumulation
more
closely
on
the
model
of
the
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
with
which
we
are
already
familiar
he
devised
a
diagram
for
enlarged
reproduction
the
difference
appearing
most
clearly
if
we
compare
the
two
assuming
that
society
annual
aggregate
product
can
be
represented
by
an
amount
to
the
value
of
denoting
millions
of
working
hours
or
in
capitalist
monetary
terms
any
arbitrary
amount
of
money
the
aggregate
product
is
to
be
distributed
as
follows
i
ii
total
department
i
represents
means
of
production
department
ii
consumer
goods
one
glance
at
the
proportion
of
the
figures
shows
that
in
this
case
simple
reproduction
alone
is
possible
the
means
of
production
made
in
department
i
equal
the
total
of
the
means
of
production
actually
used
by
the
two
departments
if
these
are
merely
renewed
production
can
be
repeated
only
on
its
previous
scale
on
the
other
hand
the
aggregate
product
of
department
ii
equals
the
total
of
wages
and
surplus
value
in
both
departments
this
shows
that
the
consumer
goods
available
permit
only
the
employment
of
just
as
many
workers
as
were
previously
employed
and
that
the
entire
surplus
value
is
similarly
spent
on
consumer
goods
the
personal
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
now
let
us
take
the
same
aggregate
product
of
in
the
following
equation
i
ii
total
here
a
double
disproportion
confronts
us
means
of
production
are
created
more
than
those
which
are
actually
used
by
the
society
leaving
a
surplus
of
similarly
less
consumer
goods
are
produced
than
the
sum
of
what
is
paid
out
in
wages
the
requirement
of
the
workers
plus
the
aggregate
of
surplus
value
that
has
been
produced
this
results
in
a
deficit
of
since
our
premises
do
not
allow
us
to
decrease
the
number
of
workers
employed
the
consequence
must
be
that
the
capitalist
class
can
not
consume
the
entire
surplus
value
it
has
pocketed
this
proves
fully
consistent
with
the
two
material
preconditions
of
enlarged
reproduction
on
a
capitalist
basis
part
of
the
appropriated
surplus
value
is
not
to
be
consumed
but
is
used
for
the
purposes
of
production
and
more
means
of
production
must
be
produced
so
as
to
ensure
the
use
of
the
capitalised
surplus
value
for
the
actual
expansion
of
reproduction
in
considering
the
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
we
saw
that
its
fundamental
social
conditions
are
contained
in
the
following
equation
the
aggregate
of
means
of
production
the
product
of
department
i
must
be
equivalent
to
the
constant
capital
of
both
departments
but
the
aggregate
of
consumer
goods
the
product
of
department
ii
must
equal
the
sum
of
variable
capitals
surplus
values
of
the
two
departments
as
regards
enlarged
reproduction
we
must
now
infer
a
precise
inverse
double
ratio
the
general
precondition
of
enlarged
reproduction
is
that
the
product
of
department
i
must
be
greater
in
value
than
the
constant
capital
of
both
departments
taken
together
and
that
of
department
ii
must
be
so
much
less
than
the
sum
total
of
both
the
variable
capital
and
the
surplus
value
in
the
two
departments
this
however
by
no
means
completes
the
analysis
of
enlarged
reproduction
rather
has
it
led
us
merely
to
the
threshold
of
the
question
having
deduced
the
proportions
of
the
diagram
we
must
now
pursue
their
further
activities
the
flow
of
circulation
and
the
continuity
of
reproduction
just
as
simple
reproduction
may
be
compared
to
an
unchanging
circle
to
be
repeated
time
and
again
so
enlarged
reproduction
to
quote
sismondi
is
comparable
to
a
spiral
with
ever
expanding
loops
let
us
begin
by
examining
the
loops
of
this
spiral
the
first
general
question
arising
in
this
connection
is
how
actual
accumulation
proceeds
in
the
two
departments
under
the
conditions
now
known
to
us
how
the
capitalists
may
capitalise
part
of
their
surplus
value
and
at
the
same
time
acquire
the
material
prerequisites
necessary
for
enlarged
reproduction
marx
expounds
the
question
in
the
following
way
let
us
assume
that
half
the
surplus
value
of
department
i
is
being
accumulated
the
capitalists
then
use
for
their
consumption
but
augment
their
capital
by
another
in
order
to
become
active
this
additional
capital
of
must
be
divided
as
we
now
know
into
constant
and
variable
capital
assuming
the
ratio
of
to
remains
what
it
was
for
the
original
capital
the
capitalists
of
department
i
will
divide
their
additional
capital
of
thus
they
will
buy
new
means
of
production
for
and
new
labour
for
this
does
not
present
any
difficulties
since
we
know
that
department
i
has
already
produced
a
surplus
of
means
of
production
yet
the
corresponding
enlargement
of
the
variable
capital
by
units
of
money
is
not
enough
since
the
new
additional
labour
power
must
also
find
adequate
consumer
goods
which
can
only
be
supplied
by
department
ii
now
the
circulation
between
the
two
large
departments
is
shifting
formerly
under
conditions
of
simple
reproduction
department
i
acquired
consumer
goods
for
its
own
workers
and
now
it
must
find
another
for
its
new
workers
department
i
therefore
engages
in
enlarged
reproduction
as
follows
department
ii
in
turn
after
selling
these
consumer
goods
to
the
value
of
is
now
in
a
position
to
acquire
additional
means
of
production
to
the
same
amount
from
department
i
and
in
fact
department
i
still
has
precisely
one
hundred
of
its
surplus
product
left
over
which
now
find
their
way
into
department
ii
enabling
the
latter
to
expand
its
own
reproduction
as
well
yet
here
too
the
additional
means
of
production
alone
are
not
much
use
to
make
them
operate
additional
labour
power
is
needed
assuming
again
that
the
previous
composition
of
capital
has
been
maintained
with
a
ratio
of
to
as
regards
constant
and
variable
capital
additional
labour
to
the
tune
of
is
required
to
work
the
additional
means
of
production
this
additional
labour
however
needs
additional
consumer
goods
to
the
amount
of
its
wages
which
are
in
fact
supplied
by
department
ii
itself
this
department
must
therefore
produce
in
addition
to
the
additional
consumer
goods
for
the
new
workers
of
department
i
and
the
goods
for
the
consumption
of
its
own
workers
a
further
amount
of
consumer
goods
to
the
tune
of
as
part
of
its
aggregate
product
department
ii
therefore
starts
on
enlarged
reproduction
at
a
rate
of
now
the
aggregate
product
of
department
i
has
been
absorbed
completely
were
necessary
for
renewing
the
old
and
means
of
production
in
both
departments
and
the
remaining
for
the
expansion
of
production
in
department
i
and
in
department
ii
as
regards
the
aggregate
product
of
department
ii
have
been
used
for
the
increased
labour
force
in
the
two
departments
and
the
consumer
goods
which
remain
serve
the
capitalists
for
their
personal
consumption
the
consumption
of
their
surplus
value
are
consumed
in
department
i
and
in
department
ii
where
out
of
a
surplus
value
of
only
had
been
capitalised
being
expended
on
means
of
production
and
on
wages
enlarged
reproduction
can
now
proceed
on
its
course
if
we
maintain
our
rate
of
exploitation
at
per
cent
as
in
the
case
of
the
original
capital
the
next
period
will
give
the
following
results
i
ii
total
the
aggregate
product
of
society
has
grown
from
to
the
surplus
value
of
department
i
from
to
and
of
department
ii
from
to
the
object
of
the
capitalist
expansion
of
production
the
increased
production
of
surplus
value
has
been
gained
at
the
same
time
the
material
composition
of
the
aggregate
social
product
again
shows
a
surplus
of
as
regards
the
means
of
production
over
and
above
those
which
are
actually
needed
and
also
a
deficit
in
consumer
goods
as
against
the
sum
total
made
up
by
the
wages
previously
paid
and
the
surplus
value
that
has
been
created
and
thus
we
again
have
the
material
possibility
as
well
as
the
necessity
to
use
part
of
the
surplus
value
not
for
consumption
by
the
capitalist
class
but
for
a
new
expansion
of
production
the
second
enlargement
of
production
and
increased
production
of
surplus
value
thus
follows
from
the
first
as
a
matter
of
course
and
with
mathematical
precision
the
accumulation
of
capital
once
it
has
started
automatically
leads
farther
and
farther
beyond
itself
the
circle
has
become
a
spiral
which
winds
itself
higher
and
higher
as
if
compelled
by
a
natural
law
in
the
guise
of
mathematical
terms
assuming
that
in
the
following
years
there
is
always
capitalisation
of
half
the
surplus
value
while
the
composition
of
the
capital
and
the
rate
of
exploitation
remain
unchanged
the
reproduction
of
capital
will
result
in
the
following
progression
year
i
ii
total
year
i
ii
total
year
i
ii
total
year
i
ii
total
thus
after
five
years
of
accumulation
the
aggregate
social
product
is
found
to
have
grown
from
to
the
social
aggregate
capital
from
to
and
the
surplus
value
from
to
whereby
the
surplus
value
for
personal
consumption
being
at
the
beginning
of
accumulation
has
grown
to
in
the
last
year
the
capitalist
class
then
has
capitalised
more
it
has
practised
greater
abstinence
and
yet
it
has
been
able
to
live
better
society
in
a
material
respect
has
become
richer
richer
in
means
of
production
richer
in
consumer
goods
and
it
has
equally
become
richer
in
the
capitalist
sense
of
the
term
since
it
produces
more
surplus
value
the
social
product
circulates
in
society
partly
it
serves
to
enlarge
reproduction
and
partly
it
serves
consumption
the
requirements
of
capitalist
accumulation
correspond
to
the
material
composition
of
the
aggregate
social
product
what
marx
said
in
volume
i
of
is
true
the
increased
surplus
value
can
be
added
on
to
capital
because
the
social
surplus
product
comes
into
the
world
from
the
very
first
in
the
material
form
of
means
of
production
in
a
form
incapable
of
utilisation
except
in
the
productive
process
at
the
same
time
reproduction
expands
in
strict
conformity
with
the
laws
of
circulation
the
mutual
supply
of
the
two
departments
of
production
with
additional
means
of
production
and
consumer
goods
proceeds
as
an
exchange
of
equivalents
it
is
an
exchange
of
commodities
in
the
course
of
which
the
very
accumulation
of
one
department
is
the
condition
of
accumulation
in
the
other
and
makes
this
possible
the
complicated
problem
of
accumulation
is
thus
converted
into
a
diagrammatic
progression
of
surprising
simplicity
we
may
continue
the
above
chain
of
equations
so
long
as
we
observe
this
simple
principle
that
a
certain
increase
in
the
constant
capital
of
department
i
always
necessitates
a
certain
increase
in
its
variable
capital
which
predetermines
beforehand
the
extent
of
the
increase
in
department
ii
with
which
again
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
variable
capital
must
be
finally
it
depends
on
the
extent
of
increase
in
the
variable
capital
in
both
departments
how
much
of
the
total
may
remain
for
personal
consumption
by
the
capitalist
class
the
extent
of
this
increase
will
also
show
that
this
amount
of
consumer
goods
which
remains
for
private
consumption
by
the
capitalist
is
exactly
equivalent
to
that
part
of
the
surplus
value
which
has
not
been
capitalised
in
either
department
there
are
no
limits
to
the
continuation
of
this
diagrammatic
development
of
accumulation
in
accordance
with
the
few
easy
rules
we
have
demonstrated
but
now
it
is
time
to
take
care
lest
we
should
only
have
achieved
these
surprisingly
smooth
results
through
simply
working
out
certain
mathematical
exercises
in
addition
and
subtraction
and
we
must
further
inquire
whether
it
is
not
merely
because
mathematical
equations
are
easily
put
on
paper
that
accumulation
will
continue
without
any
friction
in
other
words
the
time
has
come
to
look
for
the
concrete
social
conditions
of
accumulation

simple

that

in

ten

years
may
not
show
a
smaller
total

than
the

that
there

considering
the
natural
growth

take
place
only
in
so
far
as
a
correspondingly

do
not
merely
keep
pace
with
the
advance
of
accumulation
or
with
the
growth
of
social
wealth
they
develop
at
a
much
quicker
rate
because
mere
accumulation
the
absolute
increase
of
the
total
social
capital
is
accompanied
by
the
centralisation
of
the
individual
capitals
of
which
that
total
is
made
up
and
because
the
change
in
the
technological
composition
of
the

goes
hand
in
hand
with
a
similar
change
in
the
technological
composition
of
the
original
capital
with
the
advance
of
accumulation
therefore
the
proportion
of
constant
to
variable
capital
changes
if
it
was
originally
say
it
now
becomes
successively
so
that
as
the
capital
increases
instead
of
of
its
total
value
only
is
transformed
into
and
on
the
other
hand
into
means
of
production
since
the
demand
for
labour
is
determined
not
by
the
amount
of
capital
as
a
whole
but
by
its
variable
constituent
alone
that
demand
falls
progressively
with
the
increase
of
the
total
capital
instead
of
as
previously
assumed
rising
in
proportion
to
it
it
falls
relatively
to
the
magnitude
of
the
total
capital
and
at
an
accelerated
rate
as
this
magnitude
increases
with
the
growth
of
the
total
capital
its
variable
constituent
or
the
labour
incorporated
in
it
also
does
increase
but
in
a
constantly
diminishing
proportion
the
intermediate
pauses
are
shortened
in
which
accumulation
works
as
simple
extension
of
production
on
a
given
technical
basis
it
is
not
merely
that
an
accelerated
accumulation
of
total
capital
accelerated

progression
is
needed
to
absorb
an

the
remaining
must

made
up
out
of
leaving
aside
the
money
aspect
of
the
matter
we
have
as
a
result
of
this
transaction
to
be
capitalised
furthermore
realised

the

must
be
capitalised

the

by
the

are
compelled
to
capitalise
these
which
they
can
not
consume
this
leaves
of
the
but
if
ii
thus
converts
these
into
additional
constant
capital
it
requires
an
additional
variable
capital
of
this
again
must
be
taken
out
of
its
surplus
value
subtracting
this
amount
from
we
find
that
only
remain
for
the
consumption
of
the
capitalists
of
ii
and
we
obtain
the
following
values
of
capital
after
accomplishing
all
actual
and
potential
transfers
i
ii
total
this
quotation
is
given
at
length
since
it
shows
very
clearly
how
marx
here
effects
accumulation
in
department
i
at
the
expense
of
department
ii
in
the
years
that
follow
the
capitalists
of
the
provisions
department
get
just
as
rough
a
deal
following
the
same
rules
marx
allows
them
in
the
third
year
to
accumulate
a
larger
amount
this
time
than
in
the
two
preceding
years
in
the
fourth
year
they
are
allowed
to
capitalise
and
to
consume
and
in
the
fifth
year
they
accumulate
and
consume
marx
even
says
things
are
to
proceed
normally
accumulation
in
ii
must
take
place
more
rapidly
than
in
i
because
that
portion
of
i
which
must
be
converted
into
commodities
of
would
otherwise
grow
more
rapidly
than
for
which
it
can
alone
be
exchanged
yet
the
figures
we
have
quoted
fail
to
show
a
quicker
accumulation
in
department
ii
and
in
fact
show
it
to
fluctuate
here
the
principle
seems
to
be
as
follows
marx
enables
accumulation
to
continue
by
broadening
the
basis
of
production
in
department
accumulation
in
department
ii
appears
only
as
a
condition
and
consequence
of
accumulation
in
department
i
absorbing
in
the
first
place
the
surplus
means
of
production
and
supplying
it
secondly
with
the
necessary
surplus
of
consumer
goods
for
its
additional
labour
department
i
retains
the
initiative
all
the
time
department
ii
being
merely
a
passive
follower
thus
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
are
only
allowed
to
accumulate
just
as
much
as
and
are
made
to
consume
no
less
than
is
needed
for
the
accumulation
of
department
i
while
in
department
i
half
the
surplus
value
is
capitalised
every
time
and
the
other
half
consumed
so
that
there
is
an
orderly
expansion
both
of
production
and
of
personal
consumption
by
the
capitalists
the
twofold
process
in
department
ii
takes
the
following
erratic
course
year
are
capitalised
consumed
here
there
is
no
rule
in
evidence
for
accumulation
and
consumption
to
follow
both
are
wholly
subservient
to
the
requirements
of
accumulation
in
department
needless
to
say
the
absolute
figures
of
the
diagram
are
arbitrary
in
every
equation
but
that
does
not
detract
from
their
scientific
value
it
is
the
which
are
relevant
since
they
are
supposed
to
express
strictly
determinate
relationships
those
precise
logical
rules
that
lay
down
the
relations
of
accumulation
in
department
i
seem
to
have
been
gained
at
the
cost
of
any
kind
of
principle
in
construing
these
relations
for
department
ii
and
this
circumstance
calls
for
a
revision
of
the
immanent
connections
revealed
by
the
analysis
it
might
however
be
permissible
to
assume
the
defect
to
lie
in
a
rather
unhappy
choice
of
example
marx
himself
dissatisfied
with
the
diagram
quoted
above
proceeded
forthwith
to
give
a
second
example
in
order
to
elucidate
the
movements
of
accumulation
where
the
figures
of
the
equation
run
in
the
following
order
i
ii
total
in
contrast
to
the
previous
example
the
capital
of
both
departments
is
here
seen
to
have
the
same
composition
constant
and
variable
capital
are
in
a
ratio
of
to
this
already
presupposes
a
considerable
development
of
capitalist
production
and
accordingly
of
social
labour
productivity
a
considerable
preliminary
expansion
of
the
scale
of
production
and
finally
a
development
of
all
the
circumstances
which
bring
about
a
relatively
redundant
surplus
population
in
the
working
class
we
are
no
longer
introduced
to
enlarged
reproduction
as
in
the
first
example
at
the
stage
of
the
original
transition
from
simple
to
enlarged
reproduction
the
only
point
of
that
is
in
any
case
for
the
sake
of
abstract
theory
this
time
we
are
brought
face
to
face
with
the
process
of
accumulation
as
it
goes
on
at
a
definite
and
rather
advanced
stage
of
development
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
assume
these
conditions
and
they
in
no
way
distort
the
principles
we
must
employ
in
order
to
work
out
the
individual
loops
of
the
reproductive
spiral
here
again
marx
takes
for
a
starting
point
the
capitalisation
of
half
the
surplus
value
in
department
i
take
it
that
the
capitalist
class
of
i
consumes
of
the
or
and
accumulates
the
other
half
in
that
case
i
or
must
be
converted
into
since
amounts
to
only
it
is
necessary
to
take
from
the
subtracting
this
sum
from
leaves
then
we
have
to
be
capitalised
in
the
fund
set
aside
for
consumption
by
capitalists
and
labourers
to
be
capitalised
as
are
directly
annexed
by
a
variable
capital
of
or
is
required
to
set
this
additional
constant
capital
in
motion
these
must
come
out
of
the
so
that
only
remain
and
we
have
after
these
preliminary
arrangements
capitalisation
can
now
proceed
this
is
done
as
follows
in
department
i
the
which
have
been
capitalised
are
divided
into
these
withdraw
a
corresponding
amount
from
which
serves
to
buy
units
of
constant
capital
and
thus
accrues
to
an
increase
of
by
involves
the
necessity
of
an
increase
in
by
of
after
the
completion
of
this
turnover
we
therefore
have
i
v
ii
total
the
capital
of
department
i
has
grown
from
to
by
in
department
ii
it
has
grown
from
to
by
just
over
at
the
end
of
the
next
year
the
results
of
reproduction
on
this
basis
are
i
ii
total
if
the
same
ratio
is
maintained
in
the
continuance
of
accumulation
the
result
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
is
as
follows
i
ii
total
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
i
ii
total
in
the
course
of
three
years
the
total
social
capital
has
increased
from
to
and
the
total
product
from
to
accumulation
in
both
departments
here
proceeds
uniformly
in
marked
difference
from
the
first
example
from
the
second
year
onwards
both
departments
capitalise
half
their
surplus
value
and
consume
the
other
half
a
bad
choice
of
figures
in
the
first
example
thus
seems
to
be
responsible
for
its
arbitrary
appearance
but
we
must
check
up
to
make
sure
that
it
is
not
only
a
mathematical
manipulation
with
cleverly
chosen
figures
which
this
time
ensures
the
smooth
progress
of
accumulation
in
the
first
as
well
as
in
the
second
example
we
are
continually
struck
by
a
seemingly
general
rule
of
accumulation
to
make
any
accumulation
possible
department
ii
must
always
enlarge
its
constant
capital
by
precisely
the
amount
by
which
department
i
increases
the
proportion
of
surplus
value
for
consumption
and
its
variable
capital
if
we
take
the
example
of
the
first
year
as
an
illustration
the
constant
capital
of
department
ii
must
be
increased
by
and
why
because
this
capital
was
only
before
but
if
the
capitalists
of
department
i
wish
to
accumulate
half
their
surplus
value
and
to
consume
the
other
half
they
need
consumer
goods
for
themselves
and
for
their
workers
to
the
tune
of
units
which
they
can
obtain
only
from
department
ii
in
exchange
for
their
own
products
means
of
production
since
department
ii
has
already
satisfied
its
own
demand
for
producer
goods
to
the
extent
of
its
own
constant
capital
this
exchange
is
only
possible
if
department
ii
decides
to
enlarge
its
own
constant
capital
by
this
means
that
it
must
enlarge
its
own
production
and
it
can
do
so
only
by
capitalising
a
corresponding
part
of
its
surplus
value
if
this
surplus
value
amounts
to
in
department
ii
of
it
must
be
added
to
the
constant
capital
the
first
step
towards
expansion
of
production
in
department
ii
is
thus
demonstrated
to
be
at
the
same
time
the
condition
for
and
the
consequence
of
increased
consumption
by
the
capitalists
of
department
i
but
to
proceed
hitherto
the
capitalists
of
department
i
could
only
spend
of
their
surplus
value
on
personal
consumption
to
capitalise
the
other
half
they
must
redistribute
these
in
such
a
way
as
to
maintain
at
least
the
previous
ratio
of
composition
they
must
increase
the
constant
capital
by
and
the
variable
capital
by
the
first
operation
presents
no
difficulties
the
surplus
value
of
belonging
to
the
capitalists
of
department
i
is
contained
in
a
natural
form
in
their
own
product
the
means
of
production
and
is
fit
straightway
to
enter
into
the
process
of
production
department
i
can
therefore
enlarge
its
constant
capital
with
the
appropriate
quantity
of
its
own
product
but
the
remaining
can
only
be
used
as
variable
capital
if
there
is
a
corresponding
quantity
of
consumer
goods
for
the
newly
employed
workers
here
it
becomes
evident
for
the
second
time
that
accumulation
in
department
i
is
dependent
upon
department
ii
department
i
must
receive
for
its
workers
more
consumer
goods
than
before
from
department
ii
as
this
is
again
possible
only
by
way
of
commodity
exchange
department
i
can
satisfy
its
demands
only
on
condition
that
department
ii
is
prepared
for
its
part
to
take
up
products
of
department
i
producer
goods
to
the
tune
of
since
department
ii
has
no
use
for
the
means
of
production
except
to
employ
them
in
the
process
of
production
it
becomes
not
only
possible
but
even
necessary
that
department
ii
should
increase
its
own
constant
capital
by
these
very
which
will
now
be
used
for
capitalisation
and
are
thus
again
withdrawn
from
the
consumable
surplus
value
of
this
department
the
increase
in
the
variable
capital
of
department
i
thus
entails
the
second
step
in
the
enlargement
of
production
in
department
ii
all
material
prerequisites
of
accumulation
in
department
i
are
now
present
and
enlarged
reproduction
can
proceed
department
ii
however
has
so
far
made
only
two
increases
in
its
constant
capital
the
result
of
this
enlargement
is
that
if
the
newly
acquired
means
of
production
are
indeed
to
be
used
the
quantity
of
labour
power
must
be
increased
correspondingly
maintaining
the
previous
ratio
the
new
constant
capital
of
requires
a
new
variable
capital
of
this
implies
the
necessity
to
capitalise
a
corresponding
further
amount
of
the
surplus
value
thus
the
fund
for
the
capitalists
personal
consumption
in
department
ii
comes
to
be
what
remains
of
the
surplus
value
after
deduction
of
the
amounts
used
for
twice
enlarging
the
constant
capital
and
a
commensurate
increase
in
the
variable
capital
a
fund
of
after
deducting
a
total
of
similar
operations
in
the
second
year
of
accumulation
result
for
department
ii
in
its
surplus
value
being
divided
into
for
capitalisation
and
for
the
consumption
of
its
capitalists
and
in
the
third
year
the
figures
become
and
respectively
we
have
studied
this
process
so
closely
tracing
it
step
by
step
because
it
shows
clearly
that
the
accumulation
of
department
ii
is
completely
determined
and
dominated
by
the
accumulation
of
department
i
though
this
dependence
is
no
longer
expressed
as
in
marx
first
example
by
arbitrary
changes
in
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
value
it
does
not
do
away
with
the
fact
itself
even
if
now
the
surplus
value
is
always
neatly
halved
by
each
department
for
capitalisation
and
the
other
for
personal
consumption
though
there
is
nothing
to
choose
between
the
capitalists
of
the
two
departments
as
far
as
the
figures
are
concerned
it
is
quite
obvious
that
department
i
has
taken
the
initiative
and
actively
carries
out
the
whole
process
of
accumulation
while
department
ii
is
merely
a
passive
appendage
this
dependence
is
also
expressed
in
the
following
precise
rule
accumulation
must
proceed
simultaneously
in
both
departments
and
it
can
do
so
only
on
condition
that
the
increases
its
constant
capital
by
the
precise
amount
by
which
the
capitalists
of
the
increase
both
their
variable
capital
and
their
fund
for
personal
consumption
this
equation
increase
increase
increase
is
the
mathematical
cornerstone
of
marx
diagram
of
accumulation
no
matter
what
figures
we
may
choose
for
its
concrete
application
but
now
we
must
see
whether
capitalist
accumulation
does
in
actual
fact
conform
to
this
hard
and
fast
rule
let
us
first
return
to
simple
reproduction
marx
diagram
it
will
be
remembered
was
as
follows
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
consumption
total
production
here
too
we
established
certain
equations
which
form
the
foundation
of
simple
reproduction
they
were
the
product
of
department
i
equals
in
value
the
sum
of
the
two
constant
capitals
in
departments
i
and
ii
the
constant
capital
of
department
ii
equals
the
sum
of
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
in
department
i
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
product
of
department
ii
equals
the
sum
of
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
in
both
departments
a
necessary
consequence
of
and
these
equations
correspond
to
the
conditions
of
capitalist
commodity
production
at
the
restricted
level
of
simple
reproduction
however
equation
for
instance
is
a
result
of
the
production
of
commodities
entailed
by
the
fact
in
other
words
that
the
entrepreneurs
of
either
department
can
only
obtain
the
products
of
the
other
by
an
exchange
of
equivalents
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
in
department
i
together
represent
the
demand
of
this
department
for
consumer
goods
the
product
of
department
ii
must
provide
for
the
satisfaction
of
this
demand
but
consumer
goods
can
only
be
obtained
in
exchange
for
an
equivalent
part
of
the
product
of
department
i
the
means
of
production
these
equivalents
useless
to
department
ii
in
their
natural
form
if
not
employed
as
constant
capital
in
the
process
of
production
will
thus
determine
how
much
constant
capital
there
is
to
be
in
department
ii
if
this
proportion
were
not
adhered
to
if
the
constant
capital
of
department
ii
as
a
quantity
of
value
were
larger
than
i
then
it
could
not
be
completely
transformed
into
means
of
production
since
the
demand
of
department
i
for
consumer
goods
would
be
too
small
if
the
constant
capital
ii
were
smaller
than
i
either
the
previous
quantity
of
labour
power
could
not
be
employed
in
this
department
or
the
capitalists
could
not
consume
the
whole
of
their
surplus
value
in
all
these
cases
the
premises
of
simple
reproduction
would
be
violated
these
equations
however
are
not
just
an
exercise
in
mathematics
nor
do
they
merely
result
from
the
system
of
commodity
production
to
convince
us
of
this
fact
there
is
a
simple
means
at
hand
let
us
imagine
for
a
moment
that
instead
of
a
capitalist
method
of
production
we
have
a
socialist
a
planned
society
in
which
the
social
division
of
labour
has
come
to
replace
exchange
this
society
also
will
divide
its
labour
power
into
producers
of
means
of
production
and
producers
of
means
of
consumption
let
us
further
imagine
the
technical
development
of
labour
to
be
such
that
of
social
labour
are
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
producer
goods
and
in
the
manufacture
of
consumer
goods
suppose
that
under
these
conditions
units
reckoned
on
a
daily
monthly
or
yearly
basis
suffice
to
maintain
the
whole
working
population
of
the
society
one
thousand
of
these
being
employed
according
to
our
premise
in
department
soc
i
making
means
of
production
and
five
hundred
in
department
soc
ii
making
consumer
goods
and
that
the
means
of
production
dating
from
previous
labour
periods
and
used
up
during
one
year
labour
represent
labour
units
this
labour
programme
however
would
not
be
adequate
for
the
society
since
considerably
more
labour
will
be
needed
to
maintain
all
those
of
its
members
who
do
not
work
in
the
material
the
productive
sense
of
the
term
the
child
the
old
and
sick
the
civil
servant
the
artist
and
the
scientist
moreover
every
society
needs
certain
reserves
against
a
rainy
day
as
a
protection
against
natural
calamities
taking
it
that
precisely
the
same
quantity
of
labour
and
similarly
of
means
of
production
as
that
required
for
the
workers
own
maintenance
is
needed
to
maintain
all
the
and
to
build
up
the
reserves
then
from
the
figures
previously
assumed
we
should
get
the
following
diagram
for
a
regulated
production
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
consumption
here
stands
for
the
material
means
of
production
that
have
been
used
expressed
in
terms
of
social
labour
time
stands
for
the
social
labour
time
necessary
to
maintain
the
workers
themselves
and
for
that
needed
to
maintain
those
who
do
not
work
and
to
build
up
the
reserves
if
we
check
up
on
the
proportions
of
this
diagram
we
obtain
the
following
result
there
is
neither
commodity
production
nor
exchange
but
in
truth
a
social
division
of
labour
the
products
of
department
i
are
assigned
to
the
workers
of
department
ii
in
the
requisite
quantities
and
the
products
of
department
ii
are
apportioned
to
everyone
worker
or
no
in
both
departments
and
also
to
the
all
this
being
the
outcome
not
of
an
exchange
of
equivalents
but
of
a
social
organisation
that
plans
and
directs
the
process
as
a
whole
because
existing
demands
must
be
satisfied
and
production
knows
no
other
end
but
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
society
yet
all
that
does
not
detract
from
the
validity
of
the
equations
the
product
of
department
i
must
equal
this
means
simply
that
department
i
must
annually
renew
all
the
means
of
production
which
society
has
used
up
during
one
year
labour
the
product
of
department
ii
must
equal
the
sum
of
i
ii
this
means
that
society
must
each
year
produce
as
many
consumer
goods
as
are
required
by
all
its
members
whether
they
work
or
not
plus
a
quota
for
the
reserve
fund
the
proportions
of
the
diagram
are
as
natural
and
as
inevitable
for
a
planned
economy
as
they
are
for
a
capitalist
economy
based
upon
anarchy
and
the
exchange
of
commodities
this
proves
the
diagram
to
have
objective
social
validity
even
if
just
because
it
concerns
reproduction
it
has
hardly
more
than
theoretical
interest
for
either
a
capitalist
or
a
planned
economy
finding
practical
application
only
in
the
rarest
of
cases
the
same
sort
of
scrutiny
must
now
be
turned
on
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
taking
marx
second
example
as
the
basis
for
our
test
let
us
again
imagine
a
socialist
society
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
regulated
society
we
shall
of
course
have
to
start
with
department
ii
not
with
department
i
assuming
this
society
to
grow
rapidly
the
result
will
be
an
increasing
demand
for
provisions
by
its
members
whether
they
work
or
not
this
demand
is
growing
so
quickly
that
a
constantly
increasing
quantity
of
labour
disregarding
for
the
moment
the
progress
of
labour
productivity
will
be
needed
for
the
production
of
consumer
goods
the
quantities
required
expressed
in
terms
of
social
labour
incorporated
in
them
increase
from
year
to
year
in
a
progression
of
say
and
so
on
let
us
further
assume
that
technical
conditions
demand
an
increasing
amount
of
means
of
production
for
producing
this
growing
quantity
of
provisions
which
again
measured
in
terms
of
social
labour
mounts
from
year
to
year
in
the
following
progression
and
so
on
to
achieve
this
enlargement
of
production
we
must
further
have
a
growth
in
the
labour
performed
according
to
the
following
progression
the
figures
correspond
to
the
respective
amounts
of
i
ii
finally
the
labour
performed
annually
must
be
so
distributed
that
is
always
used
for
maintaining
the
workers
themselves
a
quarter
for
maintaining
those
who
do
not
work
and
the
last
quarter
for
the
purpose
of
enlarging
production
in
the
following
year
thus
we
obtain
the
proportions
of
marx
second
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
for
a
socialist
society
in
fact
three
conditions
are
indispensable
if
production
is
to
be
enlarged
in
any
society
even
in
a
planned
economy
the
society
must
have
an
increasing
quantity
of
labour
power
at
its
disposal
in
every
working
period
the
immediate
needs
of
society
must
not
claim
the
whole
of
its
working
time
so
that
part
of
the
time
can
be
devoted
to
making
provision
for
the
future
and
its
growing
demands
means
of
production
must
be
turned
out
year
after
year
in
sufficiently
growing
quantities
without
which
production
can
not
be
enlarged
on
a
rising
scale
in
respect
of
all
these
general
points
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
has
objective
validity
for
a
planned
society
it
remains
to
test
whether
it
is
also
valid
for
a
capitalist
economy
here
we
must
ask
first
of
all
what
is
the
starting
point
of
accumulation
that
is
the
approach
on
which
we
have
to
investigate
the
mutual
dependence
of
the
accumulative
process
in
the
two
departments
of
production
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
under
capitalist
conditions
department
ii
is
dependent
upon
department
i
in
so
far
as
its
accumulation
is
determined
by
the
additional
means
of
production
available
conversely
the
accumulation
in
department
i
depends
upon
a
corresponding
quantity
of
additional
consumer
goods
being
available
for
its
additional
labour
power
it
does
not
follow
however
that
so
long
as
both
these
conditions
are
observed
accumulation
in
both
departments
is
bound
as
marx
diagram
makes
it
appear
to
go
on
automatically
year
after
year
the
conditions
of
accumulation
we
have
enumerated
are
no
more
than
those
without
which
there
can
be
no
accumulation
there
may
even
be
a
desire
to
accumulate
in
both
departments
yet
the
desire
to
accumulate
plus
the
technical
prerequisites
of
accumulation
is
not
enough
in
a
capitalist
economy
of
commodity
production
a
further
condition
is
required
to
ensure
that
accumulation
can
in
fact
proceed
and
production
expand
the
effective
demand
for
commodities
must
also
increase
where
is
this
continually
increasing
demand
to
come
from
which
in
marx
diagram
forms
the
basis
of
reproduction
on
an
ever
rising
scale
it
can
not
possibly
come
from
the
capitalists
of
departments
i
and
ii
themselves
so
much
is
certain
right
away
it
can
not
arise
out
of
their
personal
consumption
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
very
essence
of
accumulation
that
the
capitalists
refrain
from
consuming
a
part
of
their
surplus
value
which
must
be
ever
increasing
at
least
as
far
as
absolute
figures
are
concerned
that
they
use
it
instead
to
make
goods
for
the
use
of
other
people
it
is
true
that
with
accumulation
the
personal
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
will
grow
and
that
there
may
even
be
an
increase
in
the
total
value
consumed
nevertheless
it
will
still
be
no
more
than
a
part
of
the
surplus
value
that
is
used
for
the
capitalists
consumption
that
indeed
is
the
foundation
of
accumulation
the
capitalists
abstention
from
consuming
the
whole
of
their
surplus
value
but
what
of
the
remaining
surplus
value
the
part
that
is
accumulated
for
whom
can
it
be
destined
according
to
marx
diagram
department
i
has
the
initiative
the
process
starts
with
the
production
of
producer
goods
and
who
requires
these
additional
means
of
production
the
diagram
answers
that
department
ii
needs
them
in
order
to
produce
means
of
consumption
in
increased
quantities
well
then
who
requires
these
additional
consumer
goods
department
i
of
course
replies
the
diagram
because
it
now
employs
a
greater
number
of
workers
we
are
plainly
running
in
circles
from
the
capitalist
point
of
view
it
is
absurd
to
produce
more
consumer
goods
merely
in
order
to
maintain
more
workers
and
to
turn
out
more
means
of
production
merely
to
keep
this
surplus
of
workers
occupied
admittedly
as
far
as
the
individual
capitalist
is
concerned
the
worker
is
just
as
good
a
consumer
purchaser
of
his
commodity
as
another
capitalist
or
anyone
else
provided
that
he
can
pay
every
individual
capitalist
realises
his
surplus
value
in
the
price
of
his
commodity
whether
he
sells
it
to
the
worker
or
to
some
other
buyer
but
this
does
not
hold
true
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
capitalist
class
as
a
whole
the
working
class
in
general
receives
from
the
capitalist
class
no
more
than
an
assignment
to
a
determinate
part
of
the
social
product
precisely
to
the
extent
of
the
variable
capital
the
workers
buying
consumer
goods
therefore
merely
refund
to
the
capitalist
class
the
amount
of
the
wages
they
have
received
their
assignment
to
the
extent
of
the
variable
capital
they
can
not
return
a
groat
more
than
that
and
if
they
are
in
a
position
to
save
in
order
to
make
themselves
independent
as
small
entrepreneurs
they
may
even
return
less
though
this
is
the
exception
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
consumed
by
the
capitalist
class
itself
in
form
of
consumer
goods
the
money
exchanged
for
these
being
retained
in
the
capitalists
pockets
but
who
can
buy
the
products
incorporating
the
other
the
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
partly
the
capitalists
themselves
the
diagram
answers
who
need
new
means
of
production
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
production
and
partly
the
new
workers
who
will
be
needed
to
work
these
new
means
of
production
but
that
implies
a
previous
capitalist
incentive
to
enlarge
production
if
new
workers
are
set
to
work
with
new
means
of
production
there
must
have
been
a
new
demand
for
the
products
which
are
to
be
turned
out
perhaps
the
answer
is
that
the
natural
increase
of
the
population
creates
this
growing
demand
in
fact
the
growth
of
the
population
and
its
needs
provided
the
starting
point
for
our
examination
of
enlarged
reproduction
in
an
hypothetical
socialist
society
there
the
requirements
of
society
could
serve
as
an
adequate
basis
since
the
only
purpose
of
production
was
the
satisfaction
of
wants
in
a
capitalist
society
however
the
matter
is
rather
different
what
kind
of
people
are
we
thinking
of
when
we
speak
of
an
increase
in
the
population
there
are
only
two
classes
of
the
population
according
to
marx
diagram
the
capitalists
and
the
workers
the
natural
increase
of
the
former
is
already
catered
for
by
that
part
of
the
surplus
value
which
is
consumed
inasmuch
as
it
increases
in
absolute
quantity
in
any
case
it
can
not
be
the
capitalists
who
consume
the
remainder
since
capitalist
consumption
of
the
entire
surplus
value
would
mean
a
reversion
to
simple
reproduction
that
leaves
the
workers
their
class
also
growing
by
natural
increase
yet
a
capitalist
economy
is
not
interested
in
this
increase
for
its
own
sake
as
a
starting
point
of
growing
needs
the
production
of
consumer
goods
for
and
is
not
an
end
in
itself
as
it
would
be
in
a
society
where
the
economic
system
is
shaped
for
the
workers
and
the
satisfaction
of
their
wants
in
a
capitalist
system
department
ii
does
not
produce
means
of
consumption
in
large
quantities
simply
to
keep
the
workers
of
departments
i
and
ii
quite
the
contrary
a
certain
number
of
workers
in
departments
i
and
ii
can
support
themselves
in
every
case
because
their
labour
power
is
useful
under
the
obtaining
conditions
of
supply
and
demand
this
means
that
the
starting
point
of
capitalist
production
is
not
a
given
number
of
workers
and
their
demands
but
that
these
factors
themselves
are
constantly
fluctuating
variables
of
the
capitalist
expectations
of
profit
the
question
is
therefore
whether
the
natural
increase
of
the
working
class
also
entails
a
growing
effective
demand
over
and
above
the
variable
capital
and
that
is
quite
impossible
the
only
source
of
money
for
the
working
class
in
our
diagram
is
the
variable
capital
which
must
therefore
provide
in
advance
for
the
natural
increase
of
the
workers
one
way
or
the
other
either
the
older
generation
must
earn
enough
to
keep
their
offspring
who
can
not
then
count
as
additional
consumers
or
failing
that
the
next
generation
the
young
workers
must
turn
to
work
in
order
to
obtain
wages
and
means
of
subsistence
for
themselves
in
which
case
the
new
working
generation
is
already
included
in
the
number
of
workers
employed
on
this
count
the
process
of
accumulation
in
marx
diagram
can
not
be
explained
by
the
natural
increase
of
the
population
but
wait
even
under
the
sway
of
capitalism
society
does
not
consist
exclusively
of
capitalists
and
wage
labourers
apart
from
these
two
classes
there
are
a
host
of
other
people
the
landowners
the
salaried
employees
the
liberal
professions
such
as
doctors
lawyers
artists
and
scientists
moreover
there
is
the
church
and
its
servants
the
clergy
and
finally
the
state
with
its
officials
and
armed
forces
all
these
strata
of
the
population
can
be
counted
strictly
speaking
neither
among
the
capitalist
nor
among
the
working
class
yet
society
has
to
feed
and
support
them
perhaps
it
is
they
these
strata
apart
from
the
capitalists
and
wage
labourers
who
call
forth
enlarged
reproduction
by
their
demand
but
this
seeming
solution
can
not
stand
up
to
a
closer
scrutiny
the
landowners
must
as
consumers
of
rent
of
part
of
the
surplus
value
quite
obviously
be
numbered
among
the
capitalist
class
since
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
surplus
value
in
its
undivided
primary
form
their
consumption
is
already
allowed
for
in
the
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
the
liberal
professions
in
most
cases
obtain
their
money
the
assignment
to
part
of
the
social
product
directly
or
indirectly
from
the
capitalist
class
who
pay
them
with
bits
of
their
own
surplus
value
and
the
same
applies
to
the
clergy
with
the
difference
only
that
its
members
also
obtain
their
purchasing
power
in
part
from
the
workers
from
wages
the
upkeep
of
the
state
lastly
with
its
officers
and
armed
forces
is
borne
by
the
rates
and
taxes
which
are
in
their
turn
levied
upon
either
the
surplus
value
or
the
wages
within
the
limits
of
marx
diagram
there
are
in
fact
only
the
two
sources
of
income
in
a
society
the
labourers
wages
and
the
surplus
value
all
the
strata
of
the
population
we
have
mentioned
as
apart
from
the
capitalists
and
the
workers
are
thus
to
be
taken
only
for
joint
consumers
of
these
two
kinds
of
income
marx
himself
rejects
any
suggestion
that
these
persons
are
more
than
a
subterfuge
members
of
society
not
directly
engaged
in
reproduction
with
or
without
labour
can
obtain
their
share
of
the
annual
produce
of
commodities
in
other
words
their
articles
of
consumption
only
out
of
the
hands
of
those
classes
who
are
the
first
to
handle
the
product
that
is
to
say
productive
labourers
industrial
capitalists
and
real
estate
owners
to
that
extent
their
revenues
are
substantially
derived
from
wages
of
the
productive
labourers
profit
and
ground
rent
and
appear
as
indirect
derivations
when
compared
to
these
primary
sources
of
revenue
but
on
the
other
hand
the
recipients
of
these
revenues
thus
indirectly
derived
draw
them
by
grace
of
their
social
functions
for
instance
that
of
a
king
priest
professor
prostitute
soldier
and
they
may
regard
these
functions
as
the
primary
sources
of
their
revenue
and
about
the
consumers
of
interest
and
ground
rent
as
buyers
marx
says
if
that
portion
of
the
of
commodities
which
the
industrial
capitalist
yields
in
the
form
of
ground
rent
or
interest
to
other
shareholders
in
the
can
not
be
in
the
long
run
converted
into
money
by
the
sale
of
the
commodities
then
there
is
an
end
to
the
payment
of
rent
and
interest
and
the
landowners
or
recipients
of
interest
can
no
longer
serve
in
the
role
of
miraculous
interlopers
who
convert
aliquot
portions
of
the
annual
reproduction
into
money
by
spending
their
revenue
the
same
is
true
of
the
expenditure
of
all
unproductive
labourers
state
officials
physicians
lawyers
and
others
who
serve
economists
as
an
excuse
for
explaining
inexplicable
things
in
the
role
of
the
public
seeing
that
we
can
not
discover
within
capitalist
society
any
buyers
whatever
for
the
commodities
in
which
the
accumulated
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
embodied
only
one
thing
is
left
foreign
trade
but
there
are
a
great
many
objections
to
a
method
that
conceives
of
foreign
trade
as
a
convenient
dumping
ground
for
commodities
which
can
not
be
found
any
proper
place
in
the
reproductive
process
recourse
to
foreign
trade
really
begs
the
question
the
difficulties
implicit
in
the
analysis
are
simply
shifted
quite
unresolved
from
one
country
to
another
yet
if
the
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
actually
intends
not
any
single
capitalist
country
but
the
capitalist
world
market
there
can
be
no
foreign
trade
all
countries
are
this
point
is
made
by
marx
already
in
the
first
volume
of
in
connection
with
accumulation
here
take
no
account
of
export
trade
by
means
of
which
a
nation
can
change
articles
of
luxury
either
into
means
of
production
or
means
of
subsistence
and
in
order
to
examine
the
object
of
our
investigation
in
its
integrity
free
from
all
disturbing
subsidiary
circumstances
we
must
treat
the
whole
world
as
one
nation
and
assume
that
capitalist
production
is
everywhere
established
and
has
possessed
itself
of
every
branch
of
industry
the
same
difficulty
presents
itself
if
we
consider
the
matter
from
yet
another
aspect
in
marx
diagram
of
accumulation
we
assumed
that
the
portion
of
the
social
surplus
value
intended
for
accumulation
exists
from
the
first
in
a
natural
form
which
demands
it
to
be
used
for
capitalisation
one
word
is
convertible
into
capital
solely
because
the
whose
value
it
is
already
comprises
the
material
elements
of
new
capital
in
the
figures
of
our
diagram
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
consumption
here
a
surplus
value
of
can
be
capitalised
because
from
the
very
outset
it
consists
in
means
of
production
to
this
quantity
of
producer
goods
there
correspond
besides
additional
consumer
goods
to
the
amount
of
so
that
can
be
capitalised
in
all
but
the
process
here
assumed
of
simply
transferring
means
of
production
to
constant
capital
on
the
one
hand
consumer
goods
to
variable
capital
on
the
other
in
commensurate
quantities
is
in
contradiction
with
the
very
structure
of
capitalist
commodity
production
whatever
natural
form
the
surplus
value
may
have
there
can
be
no
immediate
transfer
to
the
place
of
production
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
it
must
first
be
realised
it
must
be
turned
into
hard
cash
of
the
surplus
value
in
department
i
are
fit
to
be
capitalised
but
not
until
they
have
first
been
realised
the
surplus
value
has
to
shed
its
natural
form
and
assume
the
form
of
pure
value
before
it
can
be
added
to
productive
capital
this
is
true
for
each
individual
capitalist
and
also
for
the
capitalist
of
society
it
being
a
prime
condition
for
capitalist
production
that
the
surplus
value
must
be
realised
in
the
form
of
pure
value
accordingly
regarding
reproduction
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
as
a
whole
must
not
follow
the
manner
copied
by
proudhon
from
bourgeois
economy
which
looks
upon
this
matter
as
though
a
society
with
a
capitalist
mode
of
production
would
lose
its
specific
historical
and
economic
characteristics
by
being
taken
as
a
unit
not
at
all
we
have
in
that
case
to
deal
with
the
aggregate
capitalist
the
surplus
value
must
therefore
shed
its
form
as
surplus
product
before
it
can
it
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
by
some
means
or
other
it
must
first
pass
through
the
money
stage
so
the
surplus
product
of
departments
i
and
ii
must
be
bought
by
whom
on
the
above
showing
there
will
have
to
be
an
effective
demand
outside
i
and
ii
merely
in
order
to
realise
the
surplus
value
of
the
two
departments
just
so
that
the
surplus
product
can
be
turned
to
cash
even
then
we
should
only
have
got
to
the
stage
where
the
surplus
value
has
become
money
if
this
realised
surplus
value
is
further
to
be
employed
in
the
process
of
enlarging
reproduction
in
accumulation
an
even
larger
demand
must
be
expected
for
the
future
a
demand
which
is
again
to
come
from
outside
the
two
departments
either
the
demand
for
the
surplus
product
will
therefore
have
to
increase
annually
in
accordance
with
the
rate
of
increase
of
the
accumulated
surplus
value
or
accumulation
can
only
proceed
precisely
in
so
far
as
the
demand
outside
i
and
ii
is
rising

attempt
to
resolve
the
difficulty
complete
abstraction
from
the
circulation
of
money
though
making
the
process
of
accumulation
so
smooth
and
simple
in
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
has
great
disadvantages
of
its
own
we
see
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
this
method
in
the
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
where
consumption
is
the
and
of
production
money
there
had
an
ephemeral
part
mediating
the
distribution
of
the
social
product
among
the
various
groups
of
consumers
the
agent
for
the
renewal
of
capital
in
the
process
of
accumulation
however
the
money
form
has
an
essential
function
it
no
longer
serves
as
a
mere
agent
in
the
circulation
of
commodities
here
it
has
come
to
be
a
feature
of
capital
itself
an
element
in
the
circulation
of
capital
even
if
the
transformation
of
the
surplus
value
is
not
essential
to
real
reproduction
it
is
the
economic
qua
of
capitalist
accumulation
in
the
transition
from
production
to
reproduction
the
surplus
product
is
thus
subjected
to
two
metamorphoses
first
it
casts
off
its
and
then
it
assumes
a
natural
form
which
is
fit
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
the
point
here
is
not
that
the
different
cycles
of
production
are
counted
off
in
units
of
years
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
take
the
month
for
that
matter
the
successive
transformation
of
individual
portions
of
the
surplus
value
in
departments
i
and
ii
may
even
intersect
in
time
series
of
years
here
do
not
mean
units
of
time
but
really
intend
the
sequence
of
economic
transformations
what
matters
is
that
this
sequence
must
be
observed
if
accumulation
is
to
keep
its
capitalist
character
whether
it
extends
over
a
longer
or
a
shorter
period
of
time
this
brings
us
back
to
the
old
question
how
and
by
whom
is
the
accumulated
surplus
value
to
be
realised
marx
was
well
aware
that
his
seemingly
scheme
of
accumulation
did
not
cover
this
point
adequately
and
he
himself
kept
reviewing
the
problem
from
various
angles
what
he
says
is
this
has
been
shown
in
volume
i
how
accumulation
works
in
the
case
of
the
individual
capitalist
by
the
conversion
of
the
into
money
the
in
which
the
is
incorporated
is
also
monetised
the
capitalist
reconverts
the
thus
monetised
into
additional
natural
elements
of
his
productive
capital
in
the
next
cycle
of
production
the
increased
capital
furnishes
an
increased
product
but
what
happens
in
the
case
of
the
individual
capital
must
also
show
in
the
annual
reproduction
of
society
as
a
whole
just
as
we
have
seen
it
does
in
the
case
of
reproduction
on
a
simple
scale
where
the
successive
precipitation
of
the
depreciated
elements
of
fixed
capital
in
the
form
of
money
accumulated
as
a
hoard
also
makes
itself
felt
in
the
annual
reproduction
of
society
he
examines
the
mechanism
of
accumulation
further
from
this
very
point
of
view
focusing
on
the
fact
that
surplus
value
must
pass
through
the
money
stage
before
it
is
accumulated
instance
capitalist
a
who
sells
during
one
year
or
during
a
number
of
successive
years
certain
quantities
of
commodities
produced
by
him
thereby
converts
that
portion
of
the
commodities
which
bears
the
or
in
other
words
the
produced
by
himself
successively
into
money
accumulates
it
gradually
and
thus
makes
for
himself
a
new
potential
it
is
potential
on
account
of
its
capacity
and
destination
of
being
converted
into
the
elements
of
productive
capital
but
practically
he
merely
accumulates
a
simple
hoard
which
is
not
an
element
of
actual
production
his
activity
for
the
time
being
consists
only
in
withdrawing
circulating
money
out
of
circulation
of
course
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
circulating
money
thus
laid
away
by
him
was
itself
before
it
entered
into
circulation
a
portion
of
some
other
hoard
is
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
accumulated
as
a
hoard
by
the
sale
of
commodities
without
a
subsequent
purchase
if
this
operation
is
conceived
as
one
taking
place
universally
then
it
seems
inexplicable
where
the
buyers
are
to
come
from
since
in
that
case
everybody
would
want
to
sell
in
order
to
hoard
and
no
one
would
want
to
buy
and
it
must
be
so
conceived
since
every
individual
capital
may
be
in
process
of
accumulation
we
were
to
conceive
of
the
process
of
circulation
as
one
taking
place
in
a
straight
line
between
the
various
divisions
of
annual
reproduction
which
would
be
incorrect
as
it
consists
with
a
few
exceptions
of
mutually
retroactive
movements
then
we
should
have
to
start
out
from
the
producer
of
gold
or
silver
who
buys
without
selling
and
to
assume
that
all
others
sell
to
him
in
that
case
the
entire
social
of
the
current
year
would
pass
into
his
hands
representing
the
entire
of
the
year
and
all
the
other
capitalists
would
distribute
among
themselves
their
relative
shares
in
his
which
consists
naturally
of
money
gold
being
the
natural
form
of
his
for
that
portion
of
the
product
of
the
gold
producer
which
has
to
make
good
his
active
capital
is
already
tied
up
and
disposed
of
the
of
the
gold
producer
in
the
form
of
gold
would
then
be
the
only
fund
from
which
all
other
capitalists
would
have
to
derive
the
material
for
the
conversion
of
their
annual
into
gold
the
magnitude
of
its
value
would
then
have
to
be
equal
to
the
entire
annual
of
society
which
must
first
assume
the
guise
of
a
hoard
absurd
as
this
assumption
would
be
it
would
accomplish
nothing
more
than
to
explain
the
possibility
of
a
universal
formation
of
a
hoard
at
the
same
period
it
would
not
further
reproduction
itself
except
on
the
part
of
the
gold
producer
by
one
single
step
we
solve
this
we
must
distinguish
the
obstacle
in
the
way
of
realising
the
surplus
value
which
marx
here
calls
a
difficulty
nevertheless
is
important
enough
for
the
whole
further
discussion
in
volume
ii
to
be
concentrated
on
overcoming
it
as
a
first
attempt
marx
proffers
the
solution
of
a
hoard
which
owing
to
the
separation
of
the
different
individual
constant
capitals
in
the
process
of
circulation
will
inevitably
be
formed
in
a
capitalist
system
of
production
inasmuch
as
different
capital
investments
have
different
spans
of
life
and
there
is
always
an
interval
before
the
parts
of
a
plant
are
due
for
renewal
at
any
given
moment
we
may
find
that
one
individual
capitalist
is
already
busy
renewing
his
plant
while
another
is
still
building
up
reserves
from
the
proceeds
yielded
by
the
sale
of
his
commodities
against
the
day
when
he
will
have
enough
to
renew
his
fixed
capital
instance
let
a
sell
representing
to
b
who
may
represent
more
than
one
buyer
a
sells
in
commodities
for
in
money
of
which
are
which
he
withdraws
from
circulation
and
hoards
in
the
form
of
money
but
these
in
money
are
but
the
of
the
in
which
a
value
of
was
incorporated
in
order
to
comprehend
the
problem
in
complete
purity
marx
here
assumes
the
whole
of
the
surplus
value
to
be
capitalised
for
which
reason
he
ignores
altogether
that
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
used
for
the
capitalists
personal
consumption
in
addition
and
as
well
as
and
here
belong
to
department
i
formation
of
a
hoard
then
is
not
a
production
nor
is
it
an
increment
of
production
the
action
of
the
capitalist
consists
merely
in
withdrawing
from
circulation
obtained
by
the
sale
of
his
in
holding
and
hoarding
this
amount
this
operation
is
carried
on
not
alone
on
the
part
of
a
but
at
numerous
points
of
the
periphery
of
circulation
by
other
capitalists
named
however
a
accomplishes
the
formation
of
a
hoard
only
to
the
extent
that
he
acts
as
a
seller
so
far
as
his
is
concerned
not
as
a
buyer
his
successive
production
of
the
bearers
of
his
convertible
into
money
is
therefore
a
premise
for
the
formation
of
his
hoard
in
the
present
case
where
we
are
dealing
only
with
the
circulation
within
department
i
the
natural
form
of
the
and
of
the
total
product
of
which
it
is
a
part
is
that
of
an
element
of
constant
capital
of
i
that
is
to
say
it
belongs
to
the
category
of
a
means
of
production
creating
means
of
production
we
shall
see
presently
what
becomes
of
it
what
function
it
performs
in
the
hands
of
the
buyers
such
as
b
etc
must
particularly
be
noted
at
this
point
that
a
while
withdrawing
money
from
circulation
and
hoarding
it
on
the
other
hand
throws
commodities
into
it
without
withdrawing
other
commodities
in
return
the
capitalists
b
are
thereby
enabled
to
throw
only
money
into
it
and
withdraw
only
commodities
from
it
in
the
present
case
these
commodities
according
to
their
natural
form
and
destination
become
a
fixed
or
circulating
element
of
the
constant
capital
of
b
etc
there
is
nothing
new
about
this
whole
process
marx
had
already
described
it
extensively
in
connection
with
simple
reproduction
since
it
alone
can
explain
how
a
society
is
able
to
renew
constant
capital
under
conditions
of
capitalist
reproduction
how
this
process
can
lay
the
besetting
problem
of
our
analysis
of
enlarged
reproduction
is
far
from
the
difficulty
had
been
that
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
not
consumed
by
the
capitalists
but
added
to
capital
in
order
to
expand
production
giving
rise
to
the
question
of
buyers
for
this
additional
product
the
capitalists
do
not
want
to
consume
it
and
the
workers
are
not
able
to
do
so
their
entire
consumption
being
covered
in
every
case
by
the
available
variable
capital
whence
the
demand
for
the
accumulated
surplus
value
or
as
marx
would
have
it
whence
the
money
to
pay
for
the
accumulated
surplus
value
if
by
way
of
answer
we
are
referred
to
the
process
of
hoarding
attendant
upon
the
gradual
renewal
of
the
constant
capital
by
the
individual
capitalists
at
various
times
the
connection
between
these
two
points
remains
obscure
as
long
as
b
and
buy
producer
goods
from
their
colleagues
a
and
in
order
to
renew
their
constant
capital
that
has
in
fact
been
used
up
the
limits
of
simple
reproduction
are
not
transcended
and
the
whole
thing
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
problem
the
moment
the
producer
goods
purchased
by
b
serve
to
increase
their
constant
capital
however
for
purposes
of
accumulation
a
number
of
new
questions
clamour
for
attention
first
and
foremost
where
do
the
b
get
the
cash
to
buy
an
additional
product
from
the
a
the
only
way
they
could
have
made
their
money
is
by
sale
of
their
own
surplus
product
before
they
can
acquire
new
means
of
production
for
expanding
their
enterprises
before
they
appear
as
buyers
that
is
to
say
of
the
surplus
product
that
is
to
be
accumulated
they
must
first
have
disposed
of
their
own
surplus
product
in
a
word
b
must
have
been
vendors
themselves
but
who
could
have
bought
their
surplus
product
it
is
obvious
that
the
difficulty
is
simply
shifted
from
the
a
to
the
b
without
having
been
mastered
at
one
stage
of
the
analysis
it
really
does
seem
for
a
time
as
if
a
solution
were
found
at
last
after
a
short
digression
marx
returns
to
the
main
line
of
his
investigation
in
the
following
words
the
present
case
this
consists
at
the
outset
of
means
of
production
used
in
the
creation
of
means
of
production
it
is
not
until
it
reaches
the
hands
of
b
i
that
this
serves
as
an
additional
constant
capital
but
it
is
virtually
that
even
in
the
hands
of
the
accumulators
of
hoards
the
capitalists
a
i
before
it
is
sold
if
we
consider
merely
the
volume
of
values
of
the
reproduction
on
the
part
of
i
then
we
are
still
moving
within
the
limits
of
simple
reproduction
for
no
additional
capital
has
been
set
in
motion
for
the
purpose
of
creating
this
virtual
additional
capital
the
nor
has
any
greater
amount
of
been
performed
than
that
done
on
the
basis
of
simple
reproduction
the
difference
is
here
only
one
of
the
form
of
the
performed
of
the
concrete
nature
of
its
particularly
useful
service
it
is
expended
in
means
of
production
for
department
instead
of
in
means
of
production
of
means
of
production
instead
of
means
of
production
of
articles
of
consumption
in
the
case
of
simple
reproduction
it
had
been
assumed
that
the
entire
was
spent
as
revenue
in
the
commodities
of
ii
hence
it
consisted
only
of
such
means
of
production
as
restore
the
constant
capital
of
in
its
natural
form
in
order
that
the
transition
from
simple
to
expanded
reproduction
may
take
place
the
production
in
department
i
must
be
enabled
to
create
fewer
elements
for
the
constant
capital
of
ii
and
more
for
that
of
i
considering
the
matter
merely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
volume
of
values
it
follows
then
that
the
material
requirements
of
expanded
reproduction
are
produced
within
simple
reproduction
it
is
simply
a
question
of
the
expenditure
of
the
of
the
working
class
of
i
for
the
production
of
means
of
production
the
creation
of
virtual
additional
capital
of
i
the
virtual
additional
created
on
the
part
of
a
by
the
successive
sale
of
their
which
was
formed
without
any
capitalist
expenditure
of
money
is
in
this
case
simply
the
of
the
additional
means
of
production
made
by
i
on
this
interpretation
the
difficulty
seems
to
dissolve
into
thin
air
at
our
touch
accumulation
requires
no
new
sources
of
money
at
all
before
when
the
capitalists
themselves
consumed
their
surplus
value
they
had
to
have
a
corresponding
money
reserve
in
hand
the
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
already
having
proved
that
the
capitalist
class
must
itself
put
into
circulation
the
money
needed
for
the
realisation
of
their
surplus
value
now
instead
of
consumer
goods
the
capitalist
class
or
rather
b
and
buy
an
equivalent
amount
of
means
of
production
in
order
to
expand
their
production
in
this
way
money
to
the
same
value
is
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
other
capitalist
group
viz
a
etc
hoarding
does
not
in
any
way
imply
an
addition
to
the
wealth
in
precious
metals
but
only
a
change
of
function
on
the
part
of
money
previously
circulating
a
while
ago
it
served
as
a
medium
of
circulation
now
it
serves
as
a
hoard
as
a
virtual
additional
in
process
of
formation
and
that
is
that
yet
this
way
out
of
the
difficulty
is
open
to
us
only
on
one
condition
and
that
is
not
far
to
seek
marx
here
takes
accumulation
in
its
first
rudiments
statu
as
it
begins
to
evolve
from
simple
reproduction
in
respect
of
the
amount
of
value
production
is
not
yet
enlarged
it
has
only
been
rearranged
so
that
its
material
elements
are
grouped
in
a
different
way
that
the
sources
of
money
also
seem
adequate
is
therefore
not
surprising
this
solution
however
is
only
true
for
one
specific
moment
the
period
of
transition
from
simple
reproduction
to
enlarged
reproduction
in
short
a
moment
that
has
no
reference
to
reality
and
can
only
be
conceived
speculatively
once
accumulation
has
been
established
for
some
time
when
increasing
amounts
of
value
are
thrown
upon
the
market
in
every
period
of
production
buyers
for
these
additional
values
can
not
fail
to
become
a
problem
and
on
this
point
the
proffered
solution
breaks
down
for
that
matter
it
was
never
more
than
a
seeming
solution
a
real
on
closer
scrutiny
it
fails
us
even
at
the
precise
instant
it
appears
to
have
smoothed
the
way
for
us
for
if
we
take
accumulation
just
at
the
very
moment
of
its
emergence
from
simple
reproduction
the
prime
condition
it
demands
is
a
decrease
in
the
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
no
sooner
have
we
discovered
a
way
to
expand
reproduction
with
the
means
of
circulation
already
at
hand
than
we
find
previous
consumers
trickling
away
at
the
same
rate
what
then
is
the
good
of
expanding
production
who
is
there
able
to
buy
from
b
and
this
increased
amount
of
products
which
they
could
turn
out
only
by
denying
themselves
the
money
they
need
for
buying
new
means
of
production
from
a
and
that
solution
we
see
was
a
mere
illusion
the
difficulty
still
persists
marx
himself
at
once
the
question
where
b
and
get
the
money
to
buy
the
surplus
product
of
a
and
the
extent
that
the
products
created
by
b
i
in
their
natural
form
into
their
own
process
it
goes
without
saying
that
a
corresponding
portion
of
their
own
is
transferred
directly
without
any
intervention
of
circulation
to
their
productive
capital
and
becomes
an
element
of
additional
constant
capital
to
the
same
extent
they
do
not
help
to
convert
any
of
a
i
into
money
aside
from
this
where
does
the
money
come
from
we
know
that
they
have
formed
their
hoard
in
the
same
way
as
a
by
the
sale
of
their
respective
now
they
have
arrived
at
the
point
where
their
accumulated
hoard
of
virtual
is
to
enter
effectually
upon
its
function
as
additional
but
this
is
merely
turning
around
in
a
circle
the
question
still
remains
where
does
the
money
come
from
which
the
various
b
i
withdrew
from
the
circulation
and
accumulated
his
prompt
reply
again
seems
surprisingly
simple
we
know
from
the
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
that
the
capitalists
of
i
and
ii
must
have
a
certain
amount
of
ready
money
in
their
hands
in
order
to
be
able
to
dispose
of
their
in
that
case
the
money
which
served
only
for
the
spending
of
revenue
in
articles
of
consumption
returned
to
the
capitalists
in
the
same
measure
in
which
they
advanced
it
for
the
purpose
of
disposing
of
their
commodities
here
the
same
money
reappears
but
in
a
different
function
the
a
and
b
supply
one
another
alternately
with
the
money
for
converting
their
into
virtual
additional
capital
and
throw
the
newly
formed
alternately
into
circulation
as
a
medium
of
purchase
that
is
harking
back
to
simple
reproduction
all
over
again
it
is
quite
true
of
course
that
the
capitalists
a
and
the
capitalists
b
are
constantly
accumulating
a
hoard
of
money
bit
by
bit
so
as
to
be
able
to
renew
their
constant
fixed
capital
from
time
to
time
and
in
this
way
they
really
are
assisting
one
another
in
realising
their
products
yet
this
accumulating
hoard
does
not
drop
from
the
clouds
it
is
simply
a
natural
precipitation
of
the
fixed
capital
that
is
in
terms
of
value
continually
being
transferred
in
instalments
to
the
products
which
are
then
one
by
one
realised
in
the
process
of
sale
owing
to
its
very
nature
the
accumulated
hoard
can
only
cover
the
renewal
of
the
old
capital
there
can
not
possibly
be
enough
to
serve
further
for
purchasing
additional
constant
capital
that
means
that
we
are
still
within
the
limits
of
simple
reproduction
perhaps
though
that
part
of
the
medium
of
circulation
which
hitherto
served
the
capitalists
for
their
personal
consumption
and
is
now
to
be
capitalised
becomes
a
new
source
of
additional
money
for
that
to
be
true
however
we
should
have
to
be
back
at
the
unique
and
fleeting
moment
that
has
no
more
than
theoretical
existence
the
period
of
transition
from
simple
to
enlarged
reproduction
beyond
this
gap
accumulation
can
not
proceed
we
are
in
truth
going
round
in
circles
so
the
capitalist
hoarding
will
not
do
as
a
way
out
of
our
difficulties
this
conclusion
should
not
come
as
a
surprise
since
the
very
exposition
of
the
difficulty
was
misleading
it
is
not
the
source
of
money
that
constitutes
the
problem
of
accumulation
but
the
source
of
the
demand
for
the
additional
goods
produced
by
the
capitalised
surplus
value
not
a
technical
hitch
in
the
circulation
of
money
but
an
economic
problem
pertaining
to
the
reproduction
of
the
total
social
capital
quite
apart
from
the
question
which
had
claimed
marx
entire
attention
so
far
namely
where
b
i
get
the
money
to
buy
additional
means
of
production
from
a
i
successful
accumulation
will
inevitably
have
to
face
a
far
more
serious
problem
to
whom
can
b
now
sell
their
increased
marx
finally
makes
them
sell
their
products
to
one
another
may
be
that
the
different
b
i
whose
virtual
new
capital
enters
upon
its
active
function
are
compelled
to
buy
from
one
another
their
product
portions
of
their
or
to
sell
it
to
one
another
in
that
case
the
money
advanced
by
them
for
the
circulation
of
their
flows
back
under
normal
conditions
to
the
different
b
in
the
same
proportion
in
which
they
advanced
it
for
the
circulation
of
their
respective
commodities
that
case
the
problem
simply
has
not
been
solved
for
after
all
b
and
have
not
cut
down
on
their
consumption
and
expanded
their
production
just
so
as
to
buy
each
other
increased
product
means
of
production
even
that
incidentally
would
only
be
possible
to
a
very
limited
extent
marx
assumes
a
certain
division
of
labour
in
department
i
itself
the
a
turn
out
means
of
production
for
making
producer
goods
and
the
b
means
of
production
for
making
consumer
goods
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
though
the
product
of
a
need
never
leave
department
i
the
product
of
b
is
by
its
natural
form
predestined
from
the
first
for
department
ii
already
the
accumulation
of
b
it
follows
must
lead
us
to
circulation
between
departments
i
and
ii
thus
marx
analysis
itself
confirms
that
if
department
i
is
to
accumulate
the
department
for
means
of
consumption
must
in
the
last
resort
increase
its
immediate
or
mediate
demand
for
means
of
production
and
so
it
is
to
department
ii
and
its
capitalists
that
we
must
look
for
buyers
for
the
additional
product
turned
out
by
department
i
sure
enough
marx
second
attack
on
the
problem
takes
up
from
there
the
demand
of
capitalists
in
department
ii
for
additional
means
of
production
such
a
demand
inevitably
implies
that
the
constant
capital
is
in
process
of
expanding
this
is
where
the
difficulty
becomes
truly
formidable
it
now
that
a
i
converts
his
into
gold
by
selling
it
to
a
capitalist
b
in
department
ii
this
can
be
done
only
by
the
sale
of
means
of
production
on
the
part
of
a
i
to
b
ii
without
a
subsequent
purchase
of
articles
of
consumption
in
other
words
only
by
a
sale
on
a
part
now
we
have
seen
that
can
not
be
converted
into
the
natural
form
of
productive
constant
capital
unless
not
only
but
also
at
least
a
portion
of
is
exchanged
for
a
portion
of
which
exists
in
the
form
of
articles
of
consumption
but
now
that
a
has
converted
his
into
gold
by
making
this
exchange
impossible
and
withdrawing
the
money
obtained
from
out
of
circulation
instead
of
spending
it
for
articles
of
consumption
of
there
is
indeed
on
the
part
of
a
i
a
formation
of
additional
virtual
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
corresponding
portion
of
the
value
of
the
constant
capital
b
ii
held
in
the
form
of
unable
to
transform
itself
into
natural
productive
constant
capital
in
other
words
a
portion
of
the
commodities
of
b
ii
and
at
that
a
portion
which
must
be
sold
if
he
wishes
to
reconvert
his
entire
constant
capital
into
its
productive
form
has
become
unsaleable
to
that
extent
there
is
an
which
clogs
reproduction
even
on
the
same
scale
department
i
efforts
to
accumulate
by
selling
its
additional
product
to
department
ii
have
met
with
an
result
a
deficit
for
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
serious
enough
to
prevent
even
simple
reproduction
on
the
old
scale
having
got
to
this
crucial
point
marx
seeks
to
lay
bare
the
root
of
the
problem
by
a
careful
and
detailed
exposition
us
now
take
a
closer
look
at
the
accumulation
in
department
ii
the
first
difficulty
with
reference
to
that
is
to
say
the
conversion
of
an
element
of
the
of
ii
into
the
natural
form
of
constant
capital
of
ii
concerns
simple
reproduction
let
us
take
the
formula
previously
used
i
are
exchanged
for
now
if
one
half
of
the
of
i
or
is
reincorporated
in
department
i
as
constant
capital
then
this
portion
being
detained
in
department
i
can
not
take
the
place
of
any
portion
of
instead
of
being
converted
into
articles
of
consumption
it
is
made
to
serve
as
an
additional
means
of
production
in
department
i
itself
it
can
not
perform
this
function
simultaneously
in
i
and
ii
the
capitalist
can
not
spend
the
value
of
his
for
articles
of
consumption
and
at
the
same
time
consume
the
itself
productively
by
incorporating
it
in
his
productive
capital
instead
of
i
only
are
exchangeable
for
namely
of
i
but
can
not
be
reconverted
from
the
form
of
commodities
into
productive
constant
capital
of
ii
by
now
hardly
anybody
could
fail
to
be
convinced
that
the
difficulty
is
real
but
we
have
not
taken
a
single
step
nearer
a
solution
this
incidentally
is
where
marx
has
to
do
penance
for
his
continual
recourse
in
an
earlier
to
a
fictitious
moment
of
transition
in
order
in
elucidate
the
problem
of
accumulation
from
simple
reproduction
to
enlarged
reproduction
making
his
major
premise
accumulation
at
its
very
inception
in
its
feeble
infancy
instead
its
vigorous
stride
there
was
something
to
be
said
at
least
for
this
fiction
so
long
as
it
was
just
a
question
of
accumulation
within
department
i
the
capitalists
of
department
i
who
denied
themselves
part
of
what
they
had
been
wont
to
consume
at
once
had
a
new
hoard
of
money
in
hand
with
which
they
could
start
capitalisation
but
when
it
comes
to
department
ii
the
same
fiction
only
piles
on
the
difficulties
the
of
the
capitalists
in
department
i
here
finds
expression
in
a
painful
loss
of
consumers
for
whose
expected
demand
production
had
largely
been
calculated
since
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
on
whom
we
tried
the
experiment
whether
they
might
not
possibly
be
the
buyers
of
the
additional
product
of
accumulation
in
department
i
are
themselves
in
sore
straits
not
knowing
as
yet
where
to
go
with
their
own
unsold
product
they
are
even
less
likely
to
be
of
any
help
to
us
there
is
no
shutting
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
an
attempt
to
make
one
group
of
capitalists
accumulate
at
the
expense
of
the
other
is
bound
to
get
involved
in
glaring
inconsistencies
yet
another
attempt
to
get
round
the
difficulty
is
subsequently
mentioned
by
marx
who
at
once
rejects
it
as
a
subterfuge
the
unmarketable
surplus
value
in
department
ii
that
is
the
result
of
accumulation
in
department
i
might
be
considered
a
reserve
of
commodities
the
society
is
going
to
need
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
this
interpretation
marx
counters
with
his
usual
thoroughness
the
forming
of
such
supplies
and
the
necessity
for
it
applies
to
all
capitalists
those
of
i
as
well
as
of
ii
considering
them
in
their
capacity
as
sellers
of
commodities
they
differ
only
by
the
fact
that
they
sell
different
kinds
of
commodities
a
supply
of
commodities
of
ii
implies
a
previous
supply
of
commodities
of
i
if
we
neglect
this
supply
on
the
one
side
we
must
also
do
so
on
the
other
but
if
we
count
them
in
on
both
sides
the
problem
is
not
altered
in
any
way
just
as
this
year
closes
on
the
side
of
ii
with
a
supply
of
commodities
for
the
next
year
so
it
was
opened
by
a
supply
of
commodities
on
the
same
side
taken
over
from
last
year
in
the
analysis
of
annual
reproduction
reduced
to
its
abstract
form
we
must
therefore
strike
it
out
at
both
ends
by
leaving
this
year
in
possession
of
its
entire
production
including
the
supply
held
for
next
year
we
take
from
it
the
supply
of
commodities
transferred
from
last
year
and
thus
we
have
actually
to
deal
with
the
aggregate
product
of
an
average
year
as
the
object
of
our
analysis
the
simple
circumstance
that
the
difficulty
which
must
be
overcome
did
not
show
itself
in
the
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
proves
that
it
is
a
specific
phenomenon
due
merely
to
the
different
arrangement
of
the
elements
of
department
i
with
a
view
to
reproduction
an
arrangement
without
which
reproduction
on
an
expanded
scale
can
not
take
place
at
all
the
last
remark
be
it
noted
is
equally
damaging
to
his
own
earlier
attempt
at
resolving
the
specific
difficulties
of
accumulation
by
moments
pertaining
to
simple
reproduction
viz
the
formation
of
a
hoard
consequent
upon
the
gradual
turnover
of
the
fixed
capital
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalists
which
was
previously
adduced
as
the
explanation
of
accumulation
in
department
marx
then
proceeds
to
set
out
enlarged
reproduction
in
the
form
of
diagrams
but
no
sooner
does
he
begin
to
analyse
his
diagram
than
the
same
difficulty
crops
up
anew
in
a
slightly
different
guise
assuming
that
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
must
for
their
part
convert
into
constant
capital
so
as
to
make
accumulation
possible
for
the
others
he
asks
department
ii
must
buy
for
cash
without
recovering
this
money
by
a
subsequent
sale
of
its
commodities
to
i
and
this
is
a
process
which
is
continually
repeated
in
every
new
annual
production
so
far
as
it
is
reproduction
on
an
enlarged
scale
where
does
ii
get
the
money
for
this
in
the
following
marx
tries
out
various
approaches
in
order
to
discover
this
source
first
the
expenditure
on
variable
capital
by
the
capitalists
in
department
ii
is
closely
scrutinised
true
it
exists
in
the
form
of
money
but
its
proper
function
is
the
purchase
of
labour
power
and
it
can
not
possibly
be
withdrawn
and
made
to
serve
maybe
for
purchasing
additional
means
of
production
continually
repeated
departure
from
and
return
to
the
starting
point
the
pocket
of
the
capitalist
does
not
add
in
any
way
to
the
money
moving
in
this
cycle
this
then
is
not
a
source
of
the
accumulation
of
money
marx
then
considers
all
conceivable
dodges
only
to
show
them
up
as
evading
the
issue
stop
he
exclaims
there
a
chance
to
make
a
little
profit
he
considers
whether
the
capitalists
could
not
manage
to
save
a
little
of
the
variable
capital
by
depressing
the
wages
of
the
workers
below
the
normal
average
and
thus
to
tap
a
new
source
of
money
for
accumulation
a
mere
flick
of
his
fingers
of
course
disposes
of
this
notion
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
wages
actually
paid
which
determine
the
magnitude
of
the
variable
capital
under
normal
conditions
do
not
depend
on
the
benevolence
of
the
capitalists
but
must
be
paid
under
certain
conditions
this
does
away
with
this
expedient
as
a
source
of
additional
money
he
even
explores
what
hidden
methods
there
may
be
of
on
the
variable
capital
such
as
the
truck
system
frauds
only
to
comment
finally
is
the
same
operation
as
under
only
disguised
and
carried
out
by
a
detour
therefore
it
must
likewise
be
rejected
as
an
explanation
of
the
present
problem
all
efforts
to
make
the
variable
capital
yield
a
new
source
of
money
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
are
thus
unrewarded
short
we
can
not
accomplish
anything
with
for
the
solution
of
this
question
marx
next
turns
to
the
cash
reserves
which
the
capitalists
in
department
ii
keep
for
the
circulation
of
their
own
consumption
and
investigates
whether
none
of
this
money
can
be
diverted
to
the
purposes
of
capitalisation
yet
this
he
allows
is
more
impossible
the
capitalists
of
the
same
department
are
standing
face
to
face
heavily
buying
and
selling
their
articles
of
consumption
the
money
required
for
these
transactions
serves
only
as
a
medium
of
circulation
and
must
flow
back
to
the
interested
parties
in
the
normal
course
of
things
to
the
extent
that
they
have
advanced
it
to
the
circulation
in
order
to
pass
again
and
again
over
the
same
course
the
next
attempt
to
follow
belongs
as
was
to
have
been
expected
to
the
category
of
those
which
marx
ruthlessly
refutes
the
attempt
to
explain
that
can
be
formed
in
the
hands
of
one
capitalist
group
in
department
ii
by
defrauding
the
other
capitalists
within
the
same
department
viz
in
the
process
of
the
mutual
selling
of
consumer
goods
no
time
need
be
wasted
on
this
little
effort
then
comes
a
more
sober
proposition
a
certain
portion
of
represented
by
necessities
of
life
might
be
directly
converted
into
new
variable
capital
of
department
ii
it
is
not
quite
clear
how
this
can
help
us
over
the
hurdle
help
to
get
accumulation
going
for
one
thing
the
formation
of
additional
variable
capital
in
department
ii
is
not
much
use
if
we
have
no
additional
constant
capital
for
this
department
being
in
fact
engaged
on
the
task
of
finding
it
for
another
thing
our
present
concern
is
to
see
if
we
can
find
in
department
ii
a
source
of
money
for
the
purchase
of
additional
means
of
production
from
i
and
department
ii
problem
how
to
place
its
own
additional
product
in
some
way
or
other
in
the
process
of
production
is
beside
the
point
further
is
the
implication
that
the
respective
consumer
goods
should
be
used
without
the
mediation
of
money
in
the
production
of
department
ii
so
that
the
corresponding
amount
of
money
can
be
diverted
from
variable
capital
to
the
purpose
of
accumulation
if
so
we
could
not
accept
the
solution
under
normal
conditions
of
capitalist
production
the
remuneration
of
the
workers
by
consumer
goods
direct
is
precluded
one
of
the
of
capitalist
economy
being
the
of
the
variable
capital
the
independent
transaction
between
the
worker
as
buyer
of
commodities
and
producer
of
consumer
goods
marx
himself
stresses
this
point
in
another
context
know
that
the
actual
variable
capital
consists
of
and
therefore
the
additional
must
consist
of
the
same
thing
it
is
not
the
capitalist
of
i
who
among
other
things
buys
from
ii
a
supply
of
necessities
of
life
for
his
labourers
or
accumulates
them
for
this
purpose
as
the
slave
holder
had
to
do
it
is
the
labourers
themselves
who
trade
with
ii
and
that
goes
for
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
just
as
much
as
for
those
of
department
i
thus
disposing
of
marx
last
effort
marx
ends
up
by
referring
us
to
the
last
part
of
volume
ii
chapter
the
remarks
as
engels
has
called
them
here
we
find
the
curt
explanation
original
source
for
the
money
of
ii
is
of
the
gold
producers
in
department
i
exchanged
for
a
portion
of
only
to
the
extent
that
the
gold
producer
accumulates
or
converts
it
into
means
of
production
of
i
in
other
words
to
the
extent
that
he
expands
his
production
does
his
stay
out
of
department
ii
on
the
other
hand
to
the
extent
that
the
accumulation
of
gold
on
the
part
of
the
gold
producer
himself
leads
ultimately
to
an
expansion
of
production
a
portion
of
the
of
gold
production
not
spent
as
revenue
passes
into
department
ii
as
additional
variable
capital
of
the
gold
producers
promotes
the
accumulation
of
new
hoards
in
ii
and
supplies
it
with
means
by
which
to
buy
from
i
without
having
to
sell
to
it
immediately
after
the
breakdown
of
all
conceivable
attempts
at
explaining
accumulation
therefore
after
chasing
from
pillar
to
post
from
a
i
to
b
i
and
from
b
i
to
a
ii
we
are
made
to
fall
back
in
the
end
on
the
very
gold
producer
recourse
to
whom
marx
had
at
the
outset
of
his
analysis
branded
as
the
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
and
the
second
volume
of
finally
comes
to
a
close
without
having
provided
the
long
solution
to
our
difficulty

the
difficulty
viewed
from
the
angle
of
the
process
of
circulation
the
flaw
in
marx
analysis
is
in
our
opinion
the
misguided
formulation
of
the
problem
as
a
mere
question
of
sources
of
money
whereas
the
real
issue
is
the
effective
demand
the
use
made
of
goods
not
the
source
of
the
money
which
is
paid
for
them
as
to
money
as
a
means
of
circulation
when
considering
the
reproductive
process
as
a
whole
we
must
assume
that
capitalist
society
must
always
dispose
of
money
or
a
substitute
in
just
that
quantity
that
is
needed
for
its
process
of
circulation
what
has
to
be
explained
is
the
great
social
transaction
of
exchange
caused
by
real
economic
needs
while
it
is
important
to
remember
that
capitalist
surplus
value
must
invariably
pass
through
the
money
stage
before
it
can
be
accumulated
we
must
nevertheless
try
to
track
down
the
economic
demand
for
the
surplus
product
quite
apart
from
the
puzzle
where
the
money
comes
from
as
marx
himself
says
in
another
passage
money
on
one
side
in
that
case
calls
forth
expanded
reproduction
on
the
other
because
the
possibility
for
it
exists
without
the
money
for
money
in
itself
is
not
an
element
of
actual
reproduction
and
in
a
different
context
marx
actually
shows
the
question
about
the
of
money
to
be
a
completely
barren
formulation
of
the
problem
of
accumulation
in
fact
he
had
come
up
against
this
difficulty
once
before
when
examining
the
process
of
circulation
still
dealing
with
simple
reproduction
he
had
asked
in
connection
with
the
circulation
of
the
surplus
value
the
commodity
capital
must
be
monetised
before
its
conversion
into
productive
capital
or
before
the
contained
in
it
can
be
spent
where
does
the
money
for
this
purpose
come
from
this
question
seems
difficult
at
the
first
glance
and
neither
tooke
nor
anyone
else
has
answered
it
so
far
and
he
was
then
quite
uncompromising
about
getting
to
the
root
of
the
matter
circulating
capital
of
advanced
in
the
form
of
whatever
may
be
its
period
of
may
now
stand
for
the
total
capital
of
society
that
is
to
say
of
the
capitalist
class
let
the
be
how
can
the
entire
capitalist
class
manage
to
draw
continually
out
of
the
circulation
when
they
continually
throw
only
into
it
all
that
mind
you
refers
to
simple
reproduction
where
the
entire
surplus
value
is
used
for
the
personal
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
the
question
should
therefore
from
the
outset
have
been
put
more
precisely
in
this
form
how
can
the
capitalists
secure
for
themselves
consumer
goods
to
the
amount
of
surplus
value
on
top
of
putting
into
circulation
for
constant
and
variable
capital
it
is
immediately
obvious
that
those
which
in
form
of
capital
always
serve
to
buy
means
of
production
and
to
pay
the
workers
can
not
simultaneously
defray
the
expense
of
the
capitalists
personal
consumption
where
then
does
the
additional
money
come
from
the
the
capitalists
need
to
realise
their
own
surplus
value
thus
all
theoretical
dodges
one
might
devise
for
this
point
are
summarily
disposed
of
by
marx
right
away
should
not
be
attempted
to
avoid
this
difficulty
by
plausible
subterfuges
instance
so
far
as
the
constant
circulating
capital
is
concerned
it
is
obvious
that
not
all
invest
it
simultaneously
while
the
capitalist
a
sells
his
commodities
so
that
his
advanced
capital
assumes
the
form
of
money
there
is
on
the
other
hand
the
available
of
the
buyer
b
which
assumes
the
form
of
his
means
of
production
which
a
is
just
producing
the
same
transaction
which
restores
that
of
b
to
its
productive
form
transforms
it
from
money
into
materials
of
production
and
the
same
amount
of
money
serves
in
the
process
as
in
every
simple
purchase
on
the
other
hand
when
a
reconverts
his
money
into
means
of
production
he
buys
from
c
and
this
man
pays
b
with
it
and
thus
the
transaction
would
be
explained
none
of
the
laws
referring
to
the
quantity
of
the
circulating
money
which
have
been
analysed
in
the
circulation
of
commodities
vol
i
chap
iii
are
in
any
way
changed
by
the
capitalist
character
of
the
process
of
production
when
we
have
said
that
the
circulating
capital
of
society
to
be
advanced
in
the
form
of
money
amounts
to
we
have
already
accounted
for
the
fact
that
this
is
on
the
one
hand
the
sum
simultaneously
advanced
and
that
on
the
other
hand
it
sets
in
motion
more
productive
capital
than
because
it
serves
alternately
as
the
money
fund
of
different
productive
capitals
this
mode
of
explanation
then
assumes
that
money
as
existing
whose
existence
it
is
called
upon
to
explain
may
be
furthermore
said
capitalist
a
produces
articles
which
capitalist
b
consumes
unproductively
individually
the
money
of
b
therefore
monetises
the
of
a
and
thus
the
same
amount
serves
for
the
monetisation
of
the
of
b
and
the
circulating
constant
capital
of
a
but
in
that
case
the
solution
of
the
question
to
be
solved
is
still
more
directly
assumed
the
question
whence
does
b
get
the
money
for
the
payment
of
his
revenue
how
does
he
himself
monetise
this
of
his
product
might
also
be
answered
that
that
portion
of
the
circulating
variable
capital
which
a
continually
advances
to
his
labourers
flows
back
to
him
continually
from
the
circulation
and
only
an
alternating
part
stays
continually
tied
up
for
the
payment
of
wages
but
a
certain
time
elapses
between
the
expenditure
and
the
reflux
and
meanwhile
the
money
paid
out
for
wages
might
among
other
uses
serve
for
the
monetisation
of
but
we
know
in
the
first
place
that
the
greater
the
time
the
greater
must
be
the
supply
of
money
which
the
capitalist
a
must
keep
continually
in
reserve
in
the
second
place
the
labourer
spends
the
money
buys
commodities
for
it
and
thus
monetises
to
that
extent
the
contained
in
them
without
penetrating
any
further
into
the
question
at
this
point
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
consumption
of
the
entire
capitalist
class
and
of
the
unproductive
persons
dependent
upon
it
keeps
step
with
that
of
the
labouring
class
so
that
simultaneously
with
the
money
thrown
into
circulation
by
the
labouring
class
the
capitalists
must
throw
money
into
it
in
order
to
spend
their
as
revenue
hence
money
must
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
for
it
this
explanation
would
merely
reduce
the
quantity
of
money
required
but
not
do
away
with
it
it
might
be
said
a
large
amount
of
money
is
continually
thrown
into
circulation
when
fixed
capital
is
first
invested
and
it
is
not
recovered
from
the
circulation
until
after
the
lapse
of
years
by
him
who
threw
it
into
circulation
may
not
this
sum
suffice
to
monetise
the
the
answer
to
this
is
that
the
employment
as
fixed
capital
if
not
by
him
who
threw
it
into
circulation
then
by
some
one
else
is
probably
implied
in
the
sum
of
which
includes
the
formation
of
a
hoard
for
needed
reserve
funds
besides
it
is
already
assumed
in
the
amount
expended
for
the
purchase
of
products
serving
as
fixed
capital
that
the
contained
in
them
is
also
paid
and
the
question
is
precisely
where
the
money
for
this
purpose
came
from
this
parting
shot
by
the
way
is
particularly
noteworthy
in
that
marx
here
expressly
repudiates
the
attempt
to
explain
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
even
in
the
case
of
simple
reproduction
by
means
of
a
hoard
formed
for
the
periodical
renewal
of
fixed
capital
later
on
with
a
view
to
realising
the
surplus
value
under
the
much
more
difficult
conditions
of
accumulation
he
makes
more
than
one
tentative
effort
to
substantiate
an
explanation
of
this
type
which
he
himself
dismissed
as
a
subterfuge
then
follows
a
solution
which
has
a
somewhat
disconcerting
ring
general
reply
has
already
been
given
when
a
mass
of
commodities
valued
at
times
has
to
circulate
it
changes
absolutely
nothing
in
the
quantity
of
the
money
required
for
this
circulation
whether
this
mass
of
commodities
contains
any
or
not
and
whether
this
mass
of
commodities
has
been
produced
capitalistically
or
not
in
other
words
problem
itself
does
not
all
other
conditions
being
given
such
as
velocity
of
circulation
of
money
a
definite
sum
of
money
is
required
in
order
to
circulate
the
value
of
commodities
worth
times
quite
independently
of
the
fact
how
much
or
how
little
of
this
value
falls
to
the
share
of
the
direct
producers
of
these
commodities
so
far
as
any
problem
exists
here
it
coincides
with
the
general
problem
where
does
all
the
money
required
for
the
circulation
of
the
commodities
of
a
certain
country
come
from
the
argument
is
quite
sound
the
answer
to
the
general
question
about
the
origin
of
the
money
for
putting
a
certain
quantity
of
commodities
into
circulation
within
a
country
will
also
tell
us
where
the
money
for
circulating
the
surplus
value
comes
from
the
division
of
the
bulk
of
value
contained
in
these
commodities
into
constant
and
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
does
not
exist
from
the
angle
of
the
circulation
of
money
in
this
connection
it
is
quite
meaningless
but
it
is
only
from
the
angle
of
the
circulation
of
money
or
of
a
simple
commodity
circulation
that
the
problem
has
no
existence
under
the
aspect
of
social
reproduction
as
a
whole
it
is
very
real
indeed
but
it
should
not
of
course
be
put
in
that
misleading
form
that
brings
us
back
to
simple
commodity
circulation
where
it
has
no
meaning
we
should
not
ask
accordingly
where
does
the
money
required
for
realising
the
surplus
value
come
from
but
where
are
the
consumers
for
this
surplus
value
it
is
they
for
sure
who
must
have
this
money
in
hand
in
order
to
throw
it
into
circulation
thus
marx
himself
although
he
just
now
denied
the
problem
to
exist
keeps
coming
back
to
it
time
and
again
there
are
only
two
points
of
departure
the
capitalist
and
the
labourer
all
third
classes
of
persons
must
either
receive
money
for
their
services
from
these
two
classes
or
to
the
extent
that
they
receive
it
without
any
equivalent
services
they
are
joint
owners
of
the
in
the
form
of
rent
interest
etc
the
fact
that
the
does
not
all
stay
in
the
pocket
of
the
industrial
capitalist
but
must
be
shared
by
him
with
other
persons
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
question
the
question
is
how
does
he
maintain
his
not
how
does
he
divide
the
money
later
after
he
has
secured
it
for
the
present
case
the
capitalist
may
as
well
be
regarded
as
the
sole
owner
of
his
as
for
the
labourer
it
has
already
been
said
that
he
is
but
the
secondary
point
of
departure
while
the
capitalist
is
the
primary
starting
point
of
the
money
thrown
by
the
labourer
into
circulation
the
money
first
advanced
as
variable
capital
is
going
through
its
second
circulation
when
the
labourer
spends
it
for
the
payment
of
means
of
subsistence
capitalist
class
then
remains
the
sole
point
of
departure
of
the
circulation
of
money
if
they
need
for
the
payment
of
means
of
production
and
for
the
payment
of
they
throw
into
circulation
but
the
incorporated
in
the
product
with
a
rate
of
of
per
cent
is
equal
to
the
value
of
how
can
they
continually
draw
out
of
circulation
when
they
continually
throw
only
into
it
from
nothing
comes
nothing
the
capitalist
class
as
a
whole
can
not
draw
out
of
circulation
what
was
not
previously
in
it
marx
further
explodes
another
device
which
might
conceivably
be
thought
adequate
to
the
problem
a
more
rapid
turnover
of
money
enabling
a
larger
amount
of
value
to
circulate
by
means
of
a
smaller
amount
of
money
the
dodge
will
not
work
of
course
since
the
velocity
of
money
in
circulation
is
already
taken
into
account
by
equating
the
aggregate
bulk
of
commodities
with
a
certain
number
of
pounds
sterling
but
then
at
last
we
seem
in
sight
of
a
proper
solution
paradoxical
as
it
may
appear
at
first
sight
it
is
the
capitalist
class
itself
that
throws
the
money
into
circulation
which
serves
for
the
realisation
of
the
incorporated
in
the
commodities
but
mark
well
it
is
not
thrown
into
circulation
as
advanced
money
not
as
capital
the
capitalist
class
spends
it
for
their
individual
consumption
the
money
is
not
advanced
by
them
although
they
are
the
point
of
departure
of
its
circulation
this
lucid
and
comprehensive
account
is
the
best
evidence
that
the
problem
is
not
just
imaginary
but
very
real
it
provides
a
solution
not
by
disclosing
a
new
of
money
for
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
but
by
pointing
out
at
last
the
consumers
of
this
surplus
value
we
are
still
on
marx
assumption
within
the
bounds
of
simple
reproduction
the
capitalist
class
that
is
to
say
use
the
whole
of
their
surplus
value
for
personal
consumption
since
the
capitalists
are
the
consumers
of
surplus
value
it
is
not
so
much
a
paradox
as
a
truism
that
they
must
in
the
nature
of
things
possess
the
money
for
appropriating
the
objects
of
consumption
the
natural
form
of
this
surplus
value
the
circulatory
transaction
of
exchange
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
individual
capitalist
can
not
immediately
consume
his
individual
surplus
value
and
accordingly
the
individual
surplus
product
as
could
for
instance
the
employer
of
slave
labour
as
a
rule
the
natural
material
form
of
the
surplus
product
tends
to
preclude
such
use
the
aggregate
surplus
value
of
the
capitalists
in
general
is
however
contained
in
the
total
social
product
as
long
as
there
is
simple
reproduction
as
expressed
by
a
corresponding
quantity
of
consumer
goods
for
the
capitalist
class
just
as
the
sum
total
of
variable
capital
has
its
corresponding
equivalent
in
the
quantity
of
consumer
goods
for
the
working
class
and
as
the
constant
capital
of
all
individual
capitalists
taken
together
is
represented
by
material
means
of
production
in
an
equivalent
quantity
in
order
to
exchange
the
unconsumable
individual
surplus
values
for
a
corresponding
amount
of
consumer
goods
a
double
transaction
of
commodity
exchange
is
needed
first
the
sale
of
one
own
surplus
product
and
then
the
purchase
of
consumer
goods
out
of
the
surplus
product
of
society
these
two
transactions
can
only
take
place
among
members
of
the
capitalist
class
among
individual
capitalists
which
means
that
their
agent
the
money
thereby
merely
changes
hands
as
between
one
capitalist
and
another
without
ever
being
alienated
from
the
capitalist
class
in
general
since
simple
reproduction
inevitably
implies
the
exchange
of
equivalents
one
and
the
same
amount
of
money
can
serve
year
by
year
for
the
circulation
of
the
surplus
value
and
only
an
excess
of
zeal
will
inspire
the
further
query
where
does
the
money
which
mediates
the
capitalists
own
consumption
come
from
in
the
first
place
this
question
however
reduces
to
a
more
general
one
how
did
money
capital
initially
come
into
the
hands
of
the
capitalists
that
money
capital
of
which
they
always
retain
a
certain
part
for
their
personal
consumption
apart
from
what
they
use
for
productive
investment
put
in
this
way
however
the
question
belongs
in
the
chapter
of
accumulation
the
historical
genesis
of
capital
going
beyond
the
framework
of
an
analysis
of
the
process
of
circulation
as
well
as
of
reproduction
thus
the
fact
is
clear
and
unequivocal
so
long
as
we
remain
within
the
bounds
of
simple
reproduction
here
the
problem
is
solved
by
the
premises
themselves
in
fact
the
solution
is
already
anticipated
by
the
very
concept
of
simple
reproduction
which
indeed
is
based
on
the
entire
surplus
value
being
consumed
by
the
capitalist
class
this
implies
that
it
must
also
be
the
latter
who
buy
it
that
is
to
say
individual
capitalists
must
buy
it
from
each
other
the
present
case
marx
says
himself
had
assumed
that
the
sum
of
money
which
the
capitalist
throws
into
circulation
until
the
first
flows
back
to
him
is
exactly
equal
to
the
which
he
is
going
to
produce
and
monetise
this
is
obviously
an
arbitrary
assumption
so
far
as
the
individual
capitalist
is
concerned
but
it
must
be
correct
when
applied
to
the
entire
capitalist
class
when
simple
reproduction
is
assumed
it
expresses
the
same
thing
that
this
assumption
does
namely
that
the
entire
is
consumed
unproductively
but
it
only
not
any
portion
of
the
original
capital
stock
but
simple
reproduction
on
a
capitalist
basis
is
after
all
an
imaginary
quantity
in
economic
theory
no
more
and
no
less
legitimate
and
quite
as
unavoidable
as
sqrt
in
mathematics
what
is
worse
it
can
not
offer
any
help
at
all
with
the
problem
of
realising
the
surplus
value
in
real
life
with
regard
to
enlarged
reproduction
or
accumulation
marx
himself
says
so
for
a
second
time
in
the
further
development
of
his
analysis
where
does
the
money
for
realising
the
surplus
value
come
from
if
there
is
accumulation
not
consumption
but
capitalisation
of
part
of
the
surplus
value
marx
first
answer
is
as
follows
the
first
place
the
additional
required
for
the
function
of
the
increasing
productive
capital
is
supplied
by
that
portion
of
the
realised
which
is
thrown
into
circulation
by
the
capitalists
as
not
as
the
money
form
of
their
revenue
the
money
is
already
present
in
the
hands
of
the
capitalists
only
its
employment
is
different
our
investigation
of
the
reproductive
process
has
already
made
us
familiar
with
this
explanation
and
we
are
equally
familiar
with
its
defects
for
one
thing
the
answer
rests
on
the
moment
of
the
first
transition
from
simple
reproduction
to
accumulation
the
capitalists
only
yesterday
consumed
their
entire
surplus
value
and
thus
had
in
hand
an
appropriate
amount
of
money
for
their
circulation
they
decide
to
part
of
the
surplus
value
and
to
invest
it
productively
instead
of
squandering
it
provided
that
material
means
of
production
were
manufactured
instead
of
luxury
goods
they
need
only
put
part
of
their
personal
money
fund
to
a
different
use
but
the
transition
from
simple
reproduction
to
expanded
reproduction
is
no
less
a
theoretical
fiction
than
simple
reproduction
of
capital
itself
for
which
reason
marx
immediately
goes
on
to
say
by
means
of
the
additional
productive
capital
its
product
an
additional
quantity
of
commodities
is
thrown
into
circulation
together
with
this
additional
quantity
of
commodities
a
portion
of
the
additional
money
required
for
its
circulation
is
thrown
into
circulation
so
far
as
the
value
of
this
mass
of
commodities
is
equal
to
that
of
the
productive
capital
consumed
in
their
production
this
additional
quantity
of
money
has
precisely
been
advanced
as
an
additional
and
therefore
it
flows
back
to
the
capitalist
through
the
of
his
capital
here
the
same
question
reappears
which
we
met
previously
where
does
the
additional
money
come
from
by
which
the
additional
now
contained
in
the
form
of
commodities
is
to
be
realised
the
problem
could
not
be
put
more
precisely
but
instead
of
a
solution
there
follows
the
surprising
conclusion
general
reply
is
again
the
same
the
sum
total
of
the
prices
of
the
commodities
has
been
increased
not
because
the
prices
of
a
given
quantity
of
commodities
have
risen
but
because
the
mass
of
the
commodities
now
circulating
is
greater
than
that
of
the
previously
circulating
commodities
and
because
this
increase
has
not
been
offset
by
a
fall
in
prices
the
additional
money
required
for
the
circulation
of
this
greater
quantity
of
commodities
of
greater
value
must
be
secured
either
by
greater
economy
in
the
circulating
quantity
of
money
whether
by
means
of
balancing
payments
or
by
some
measure
which
accelerates
the
circulation
of
the
same
coins
or
by
the
transformation
of
money
from
the
form
of
a
hoard
into
that
of
a
circulating
medium
all
this
amounts
to
an
exposition
along
these
lines
under
conditions
of
developing
and
growing
accumulation
capitalist
reproduction
dumps
ever
larger
masses
of
commodity
values
on
the
market
to
put
this
commodity
mass
of
a
continually
increasing
value
into
circulation
requires
an
ever
larger
amount
of
money
this
increasing
amount
of
money
must
be
found
somehow
or
other
all
this
is
no
doubt
plausible
and
correct
as
far
as
it
goes
but
our
problem
is
not
solved
it
is
merely
wished
away
one
thing
or
the
other
either
we
regard
the
aggregate
social
product
in
a
capitalist
economy
simply
as
a
mass
a
conglomeration
of
commodities
of
a
certain
value
seeing
under
conditions
of
accumulation
a
mere
increase
in
this
undifferentiated
mass
of
commodities
and
in
the
bulk
of
its
value
then
all
we
need
say
is
that
a
corresponding
quantity
of
money
is
required
for
circulating
this
bulk
of
value
that
with
an
increasing
bulk
of
value
the
quantity
of
money
must
also
increase
unless
this
growth
of
value
is
offset
by
acceleration
of
and
economy
in
the
traffic
and
the
final
question
where
does
all
money
originally
come
from
could
then
be
answered
on
marx
recipe
from
the
gold
mines
this
of
course
is
one
way
of
looking
at
things
that
of
simple
commodity
circulation
but
in
that
case
there
is
no
need
to
drag
in
concepts
such
as
constant
and
variable
capital
or
surplus
value
which
have
no
place
in
simple
commodity
circulation
belonging
essentially
to
the
circulation
of
capitals
and
to
social
reproduction
nor
is
there
need
to
inquire
for
sources
of
money
for
the
realisation
of
the
social
surplus
value
under
conditions
of
first
simple
and
then
enlarged
reproduction
under
the
aspect
of
simple
commodity
circulation
puzzles
of
this
kind
are
without
meaning
or
content
but
once
these
questions
have
been
raised
once
the
course
has
been
set
for
an
investigation
into
the
circulation
of
capitals
and
social
reproduction
there
can
be
no
appealing
to
the
sphere
of
simple
commodity
circulation
where
there
is
no
such
problem
at
all
and
consequently
no
solution
to
it
there
can
be
no
looking
for
the
answer
there
and
then
saying
triumphantly
that
the
problem
has
long
been
solved
and
in
fact
never
really
existed
all
this
time
it
appears
marx
has
been
tackling
the
problem
from
a
wrong
approach
no
intelligent
purpose
can
be
served
by
asking
for
the
source
of
the
money
needed
to
realise
the
surplus
value
the
question
is
rather
where
the
demand
can
arise
to
find
an
effective
demand
for
the
surplus
value
if
the
problem
had
been
put
in
this
way
at
the
start
no
such
detours
would
have
been
needed
to
show
whether
it
can
be
solved
or
not
on
the
basis
of
simple
reproduction
the
matter
is
easy
enough
since
all
surplus
value
is
consumed
by
the
capitalists
they
themselves
are
the
buyers
and
provide
the
full
demand
for
the
social
surplus
value
and
by
the
same
token
they
must
also
have
the
requisite
cash
in
hand
for
circulation
of
the
surplus
value
but
in
this
showing
it
is
quite
evident
that
under
conditions
of
accumulation
of
capitalisation
of
part
of
the
surplus
value
it
can
not
be
the
capitalists
themselves
who
buy
the
entire
surplus
value
that
they
can
not
possibly
realise
it
true
if
the
capitalised
surplus
value
is
to
be
realised
at
all
money
must
be
forthcoming
in
adequate
quantities
for
its
realisation
but
it
is
quite
impossible
that
this
money
should
come
from
the
purse
of
the
capitalist
class
itself
just
because
accumulation
is
postulated
the
capitalists
can
not
buy
their
surplus
value
themselves
even
though
they
might
have
the
money
to
do
so
but
who
else
could
provide
the
demand
for
the
commodities
incorporating
the
capitalised
surplus
value
from
this
class
the
capitalists
there
is
according
to
our
assumption
the
general
and
exclusive
domination
of
capitalist
production
no
other
class
but
the
working
class
all
that
the
working
class
buys
is
equal
to
the
sum
total
of
its
wages
equal
to
the
sum
total
of
the
variable
capital
advanced
by
the
entire
capitalist
class
the
workers
then
are
even
less
able
than
the
capitalist
class
to
realise
the
capitalised
surplus
value
somebody
must
buy
it
if
the
capitalists
are
still
to
be
able
to
recover
the
capital
they
have
accumulated
and
advanced
and
yet
we
can
not
think
of
any
buyers
other
than
capitalists
and
workers
can
the
entire
capitalist
class
accumulate
money
under
such
circumstances
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
outside
the
only
two
existing
classes
of
society
appears
as
indispensable
as
it
looks
impossible
the
accumulation
of
capital
has
been
caught
in
a
vicious
circle
at
any
rate
the
second
volume
of
offers
no
way
out
if
we
should
now
ask
why
marx
affords
no
solution
to
this
important
problem
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
we
must
bear
in
mind
above
all
that
this
second
volume
is
not
a
finished
whole
but
a
manuscript
that
stops
short
half
way
through
the
external
form
of
its
last
chapters
in
particular
proves
them
to
be
in
the
nature
of
notes
intended
to
clear
the
author
own
mind
rather
than
final
conclusions
ready
for
the
reader
enlightenment
this
fact
is
amply
authenticated
by
the
man
best
in
the
position
to
know
friedrich
engels
who
edited
the
second
volume
in
his
introduction
to
the
second
volume
he
reports
in
detail
on
the
conditions
of
the
preliminary
studies
and
the
manuscripts
marx
had
left
which
were
to
form
the
basis
of
this
volume
mere
enumeration
of
the
manuscripts
left
by
marx
as
a
basis
for
volume
ii
proves
the
unparalleled
conscientiousness
and
strict
which
he
practised
in
his
endeavour
to
fully
elaborate
his
great
economic
discoveries
before
he
published
them
this
rarely
permitted
him
to
adapt
his
presentation
of
the
subject
in
content
as
well
as
in
form
to
his
ever
widening
horizon
which
he
enlarged
by
incessant
study
material
consists
of
the
following
parts
first
a
manuscript
entitled
a
contribution
to
the
critique
of
political
economy
containing
quarto
pages
in
divisions
written
in
the
time
from
august
to

it
is
a
continuation
of
the
work
of
the
same
title
the
first
volume
of
which
appeared
in
berlin
in
this
manuscript
valuable
though
it
is
could
not
be
used
in
the
present
edition
of

ii
manuscript
next
following
in
the
order
of
time
is
that
of
volume
iii
period
after
the
publication
of
volume
i
which
is
next
in
order
is
represented
by
a
collection
of
four
manuscripts
for
volume
ii
marked
by
marx
himself
manuscript
i
pages
presumably
written
in
or
is
the
first
independent
but
more
or
less
fragmentary
elaboration
of
the
questions
now
contained
in
volume
ii
this
manuscript
is
likewise
unsuited
for
this
edition
manuscript
iii
is
partly
a
compilation
of
quotations
and
references
to
the
manuscripts
containing
marx
extracts
and
comments
most
of
them
relating
to
the
first
section
of
volume
ii
partly
an
elaboration
of
special
points
particularly
a
critique
of
adam
smith
statements
as
to
fixed
and
circulating
capital
and
the
source
of
profits
furthermore
a
discussion
of
the
relations
of
the
rate
of
to
the
rate
of
profit
which
belongs
in
volume
iii
the
references
furnished
little
that
was
new
while
the
elaborations
for
volumes
ii
and
iii
were
rendered
valueless
through
subsequent
revisions
and
had
to
be
ruled
out
for
the
greater
part
manuscript
iv
is
an
elaboration
ready
for
printing
of
the
first
section
and
the
first
chapters
of
the
second
section
of
volume
ii
and
has
been
used
in
its
proper
place
although
it
was
found
that
this
manuscript
had
been
written
earlier
than
manuscript
ii
yet
it
was
far
more
finished
in
form
and
could
be
used
with
advantage
for
the
corresponding
part
of
this
volume
i
had
to
add
only
a
few
supplementary
parts
of
manuscript
ii
this
last
manuscript
is
the
only
fairly
completed
elaboration
of
volume
ii
and
dates
from
the
year
the
notes
for
the
final
revision
which
i
shall
mention
immediately
say
explicitly
the
second
elaboration
must
be
used
as
a
basis
is
another
interruption
after
due
mainly
to
ill
health
marx
employed
this
time
in
his
customary
way
that
is
to
say
he
studied
agronomics
agricultural
conditions
in
america
and
especially
russia
the
money
market
and
banking
institutions
and
finally
natural
sciences
such
as
geology
and
physiology
independent
mathematical
studies
also
form
a
large
part
of
the
numerous
manuscripts
of
this
period
in
the
beginning
of
marx
had
recovered
sufficiently
to
resume
once
more
his
chosen
life
work
the
beginning
of
is
marked
by
references
and
notes
from
the
above
named
four
manuscripts
intended
for
a
new
elaboration
of
volume
ii
the
beginning
of
which
is
represented
by
manuscript
v
pages
in
folio
it
comprises
the
first
four
chapters
and
is
not
very
fully
worked
out
essential
points
are
treated
in
footnotes
the
material
is
rather
collected
than
sifted
but
it
is
the
last
complete
presentation
of
this
most
important
first
section
a
preliminary
attempt
to
prepare
this
part
for
the
printer
was
made
in
manuscript
vi
after
october
and
before
july
embracing
quarto
pages
the
greater
part
of
the
first
chapter
a
second
and
last
attempt
was
made
in
manuscript
vii
dated
july
and
consisting
of
pages
in
folio
this
time
marx
seems
to
have
realised
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
complete
the
second
and
third
volume
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
himself
unless
a
complete
revolution
in
his
health
took
place
manuscripts
show
traces
of
hard
struggles
against
depressing
physical
conditions
far
too
frequently
to
be
ignored
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
first
section
had
been
worked
over
in
manuscript
the
remainder
of
the
first
and
the
entire
second
section
with
the
exception
of
chapter
presented
no
great
theoretical
difficulties
but
the
third
section
dealing
with
the
reproduction
and
circulation
of
social
capital
seemed
to
be
very
much
in
need
of
revision
manuscript
ii
it
must
be
pointed
out
had
first
treated
of
this
reproduction
without
regard
to
the
circulation
which
is
instrumental
in
effecting
it
and
then
taken
up
the
same
question
with
regard
to
circulation
it
was
the
intention
of
marx
to
eliminate
this
section
and
to
reconstruct
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
conform
to
his
wider
grasp
of
the
subject
this
gave
rise
to
manuscript
viii
containing
only
pages
in
quarto
a
comparison
with
section
iii
as
printed
after
deducting
the
paragraphs
inserted
out
of
manuscript
ii
shows
the
amount
of
matter
compressed
by
marx
into
this
space
viii
is
likewise
merely
a
preliminary
presentation
of
the
subject
and
its
main
object
was
to
ascertain
and
develop
the
new
points
of
view
not
set
forth
in
manuscript
ii
while
those
points
were
ignored
about
which
there
was
nothing
new
to
say
an
essential
part
of
chapter
section
ii
which
is
more
or
less
relevant
to
section
iii
was
at
the
same
time
drawn
into
this
discussion
and
expanded
the
logical
sequence
was
frequently
interrupted
the
treatment
of
the
subject
was
incomplete
in
various
places
and
especially
the
conclusion
was
very
fragmentary
but
marx
expressed
as
nearly
as
possible
what
he
intended
to
say
on
the
subject
is
the
material
for
volume
ii
out
of
which
i
was
supposed
to
make
something
as
marx
said
to
his
daughter
eleanor
shortly
before
his
death
we
can
not
but
admire
this
which
engels
managed
to
from
material
of
such
a
kind
as
far
as
our
present
problem
is
concerned
however
this
detailed
report
makes
it
clear
that
no
more
than
the
first
two
of
the
three
sections
that
make
up
volume
ii
were
anything
like
ready
for
print
in
the
manuscripts
marx
left
the
section
the
circulation
of
money
and
commodity
capital
and
on
causes
of
circulation
and
the
turnover
of
capital
the
third
section
which
treats
of
the
reproduction
of
total
capital
is
merely
a
collection
of
fragments
which
marx
himself
considered
to
be
much
in
need
of
revision
yet
it
is
the
last
part
of
this
section
chapter
accumulation
and
enlarged
reproduction
which
is
of
primary
importance
in
the
present
context
and
of
the
whole
book
this
is
the
most
incomplete
it
comprises
pages
of
print
in
all
and
breaks
off
right
in
the
middle
of
the
analysis
besides
this
extraneous
circumstance
we
would
suggest
another
point
of
great
influence
marx
investigation
of
the
social
reproductive
process
starts
off
as
we
have
seen
from
the
analysis
of
adam
smith
which
came
to
grief
among
other
reasons
because
of
the
erroneous
doctrine
that
the
price
of
all
commodities
is
composed
of
polemics
against
this
dogma
dominated
marx
entire
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
he
devoted
all
his
attention
to
proving
that
the
total
capital
of
society
must
serve
not
only
for
consumption
to
the
full
amount
of
the
various
sources
of
revenue
but
also
for
renewal
of
the
constant
capital
and
inasmuch
as
the
purest
theoretical
form
for
this
line
of
reasoning
is
given
not
by
enlarged
reproduction
but
by
simple
reproduction
marx
tends
to
consider
reproduction
mainly
from
a
point
of
view
that
is
the
very
opposite
of
accumulation
from
the
assumption
that
the
entire
surplus
value
is
consumed
by
the
capitalists
how
greatly
these
polemics
influenced
his
analysis
is
proved
by
his
returning
time
and
again
in
the
course
of
his
work
to
the
attack
on
adam
smith
from
the
most
various
angles
so
already
in
volume
i
the
following
pages
are
devoted
to
it
vol
i
sect

pp
and
in
vol
ii
pp
pp
and
pp
marx
again
takes
up
the
question
of
total
reproduction
in
volume
iii
but
from
the
start
becomes
once
more
involved
with
the
problem
set
by
smith
to
which
he
devotes
the
whole
of
his
chapter
and
most
of
chapter
pp
and
finally
in
ueber
den
we
again
find
detailed
polemics
against
smith
dogma
pp
in
vol
i
and
pp
and
in
vol
ii
part
marx
repeatedly
stressed
and
emphasised
the
fact
that
he
considered
replacement
of
the
constant
capital
from
the
aggregate
social
product
the
most
difficult
and
important
problem
of
reproduction
the
other
problem
that
of
accumulation
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
for
the
purpose
of
capitalisation
was
thus
pushed
into
the
background
so
that
in
the
end
marx
hardly
touched
upon
it
this
problem
being
of
such
paramount
importance
for
capitalist
economy
it
is
not
surprising
that
bourgeois
economists
have
dealt
with
it
again
and
again
attempts
to
grapple
with
this
vital
question
for
capitalist
economy
with
the
question
whether
capital
accumulation
is
possible

practice
come
up
time
and
again
in
the
history
of
economic
theory

these
historical
attempts

and
after

solving

problem

to
bourgeois

under
the
immediate
impact
of
the
first
crises
of
and
in
england
even
then
it
had
still
been
external
circumstances
which
led
up
to
these
crises
and
they
appeared
to
be
ephemeral
napoleon
blockade
of
the
continent
which
for
a
time
had
cut
off
england
from
her
european
markets
and
had
favoured
a
considerable
development
of
home
industries
in
some
of
the
continental
countries
was
partly
responsible
for
the
rest
the
material
exhaustion
of
the
continent
owing
to
the
long
period
of
war
made
for
a
smaller
demand
for
english
products
than
had
been
expected
when
the
blockade
was
lifted
still
these
early
crises
were
enough
to
reveal
to
the
contemporary
world
the
sinister
aspects
of
this
best
of
all
social
orders
glutted
markets
shops
filled
with
goods
nobody
could
buy
frequent
bankruptcies
and
on
the
other
hand
the
glaring
poverty
of
the
toiling
masses
for
the
first
time
all
this
starkly
met
the
eyes
of
theorists
who
had
preached
the
gospel
of
the
beautiful
harmonies
of
bourgeois
and
had
sung
its
praises
in
all
keys
all
contemporary
trade
reports

and
travellers

of
the

not

and

at
the
same
time
england
was
hearing
the
desperate
outcry
of
her
workers
the
of
quotes
an
address
by
the
nottingham
knitters
which
contained
the
following
statements
working
from
to
hours
a
day
we
only

from
to
a
week
to
maintain
our
wives

farther
state

substituted

that
more
wholesome
food

under
the
necessity

supperless

to
stifle
the
cries
of
hunger
we
can
most
solemnly
declare
that
for
the
last
eighteen
months
we
have
scarcely
known
what
it
was
to
be
free
from
the
pangs
of
hunger
then
owen
in
england
and
sismondi
in
france
almost
simultaneously
raised
their
voices
in
a
weighty
indictment
of
capitalist
society
owen
as
a
englishman
and
citizen
of
the
leading
industrial
state
constituted
himself
spokesman
for
a
generous
social
reform
whereas
the
swiss
rather
lost
himself
in
sweeping
denunciations
of
the
imperfections
of
the
existing
social
order
and
of
classical
economics
and
yet
by
so
doing
sismondi
gave
bourgeois
economics
a
much
harder
nut
to
crack
than
owen
whose
fertile
practical
activities
were
directly
applied
to
the
proletariat
sismondi
explained
in
some
detail
that
the
impetus
for
his
social
criticism
came
from
england
and
especially
her
first
crisis
in
the
second
edition
of
his
principes
politique
ou
de
la
richesse
dans
ses
rapports

eight
years
after
the
publication
of

that
i

england

to
the
most
celebrated
political
economists

at

with
increased
ardour
universal
competition

the
effort
always
to
produce
more
and
always
cheaper
has
long
been
the
system
in
england
a
system
which
i
have
attacked
as
dangerous
this
system
has
used
production
by

to
advance
with
gigantic
steps

it

from

to

distress
it

in

astonishing
country

seems
to
be

to
a
great
experiment
for
the
instruction
of
the
rest
of
the

i
have
seen
production
increasing
whilst
enjoyments
were
diminishing
the
mass
of
the
nation
here
no
less
than
philosophers
seems
to
forget
that
the
increase
of
wealth
is
not
the
end
in
political
economy
but
its
instrument
in
procuring
the
happiness
of
all
i
sought
for
this
happiness
in
every
class
and
i
could
nowhere
find
it
the
high
english
aristocracy
has
indeed
arrived
to
a
degree
of
wealth
and
luxury
which
surpasses
all
that
can
be
seen
in
other
nations
nevertheless
it
does
not
itself
enjoy
the
opulence
which
it
seems
to
have
acquired
at
the
expense
of
the
other
classes
security
is
wanting

in

most
of
the

privation
rather

held
up

almost
a
century
before

of

clear
and
comprehensive
enough
in

conscience
sismondi
put
his
finger
on
every
one
of
the
sore
spots
of
bourgeois
economics
the
ruin
of
small
enterprise
the
drift
from
the
country
the
proletarisation
of
the
middle
classes
the
impoverishment
of
the
workers
the
displacement
of
the
worker
by

machine
unemployment
the
dangers
of
the
credit
system
social
antagonisms
the
insecurity
of
existence
crises
and
anarchy
his
harsh
emphatic
scepticism
struck
a
specially
shrill
discord
with
the
complacent
optimism
the
idle
worship
of
harmony
as
preached
by
vulgar
economics
which
in
the
person
of
macculloch
in
england
and
of
say
in
france
was
becoming
the
fashion
in
both
countries
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
a
deep
and
painful
impression
remarks
like
the
following
were
bound
to
make
can
only
be
luxury
if
it
is
bought
with
another
labour
only
those
will
work
hard
and
untiringly
who
have
to
do
so
in
order
to
get
not
the
frills
but
the
very
necessities
of
life
the
invention
of
the
machine
which
increases
man
capacity
is
a
blessing
for
mankind
it
is
made
into
a
scourge
for
the
poor
by
the
unjust
distribution
we
make
of
its
benefits
gain
of
an
employer
of
labour
is
sometimes
nothing
if
not
despoiling
the
worker
he
employs
he
does
not
benefit
because
his
enterprise
produces
much
more
than
it
costs
but
because
he
does
not
pay
all
the
costs
because
he
does
not
accord
the
labourer
a
remuneration
equal
to
his
work
such
an
industry
is
a
social
evil
for
it
reduces
those
who
perform
the
work
to
utmost
poverty
assuring
to
those
who
direct
it
but
the
ordinary
profits
on
capital
those
who
share
in
the
national
income
one
group
acquires
new
rights
each
year
by
new
labours
the
other
have
previously
acquired
permanent
rights
by
reason
of
a
primary
effort
which
makes
a
labour
more
advantageous
can
prevent
that
every
new
discovery
in
applied
mechanics
should
diminish
the
working
population
by
that
much
to
this
danger
it
is
constantly
exposed
and
society
provides
no
remedy
for
it
time
will
come
no
doubt
when
our
descendants
will
condemn
us
as
barbarians
because
we
have
left
the
working
classes
without
security
just
as
we
already
condemn
as
they
also
will
as
barbarian
the
nations
who
reduced
those
same
classes
to
slavery
sismondi
criticism
thus
goes
right
to
the
root
of
the
matter
for
him
there
can
be
no
compromise
or
evasion
which
might
try
to
gloss
over
the
dark
aspects
of
capitalist
enrichment
he
exposed
as
merely
temporary
shortcomings
of
a
transition
period
he
concludes
his
investigation
with
the
following
rejoinder
to
say
seven
years
i
have
indicated
this
malady
of
the
social
organism
and
for
seven
years
it
has
continuously
increased
i
can
not
regard
such
prolonged
suffering
as
the
mere
frictions
which
always
accompany
a
change
going
back
to
the
origin
of
income
i
believe
to
have
shown
the
ills
we
experience
to
be
the
consequence
of
a
flaw
in
our
organisation
to
have
shown
that
they
are
not
likely
to
come
to
an
end
the
disproportion
between
capitalist
production
and
the
distribution
of
incomes
determined
by
the
former
appears
to
him
the
source
of
all
evil
this
is
the
point
from
which
he
comes
to
the
problem
of
accumulation
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
the
main
thread
of
his
criticism
against
classical
economics
is
this
capitalist
production
is
encouraged
to
expand
indefinitely
without
any
regard
to
consumption
consumption
however
is
determined
by
income
the
modern
economists
in
fact
have
allowed
that
the
fortune
of
the
public
being
only
the
aggregation
of
private
fortunes
has
its
origin
is
augmented
distributed
and
destroyed
by
the
same
means
as
the
fortune
of
each
individual
they
all
know
perfectly
well
that
in
a
private
fortune
the
most
important
fact
to
consider
is
the
income
and
that
by
the
income
must
be
regulated
consumption
or
expenditure
or
the
capital
will
be
destroyed
but
as
in
the
fortune
of
the
public
the
capital
of
one
becomes
the
income
of
another
they
have
been
perplexed
to
decide
what
was
capital
and
what
income
and
they
have
therefore
found
it
more
simple
to
leave
the
latter
entirely
out
of
their
calculations
by
neglecting
a
quality
so
essential
to
be
determined
say
and
ricardo
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
consumption
is
an
unlimited
power
or
at
least
having
no
limits
but
those
of
production
whilst
it
is
in
fact
limited
by
income
they
announced
that
whatever
abundance
might
be
produced
it
would
always
find
consumers
and
they
have
encouraged
the
producers
to
cause
that
glut
in
the
markets
which
at
this
time
occasions
the
distress
of
the
civilised
world
whereas
they
should
have
forewarned
the
producers
that
they
could
only
reckon
on
those
consumers
who
possessed
income
sismondi
thus
grounds
his
views
in
a
theory
of
income
what
is
income
and
what
is
capital
he
pays
the
greatest
attention
to
this
distinction
which
he
calls
most
abstract
and
difficult
question
of
political
economics
the
fourth
chapter
of
his
second
book
is
devoted
to
this
problem
as
usual
sismondi
starts
his
investigation
with
robinson
crusoe
for
such
a
one
the
distinction
between
capital
and
income
was
still
it
becomes
only
in
society
yet
in
society
too
this
distinction
is
very
difficult
largely
on
account
of
the
already
familiar
myth
of
bourgeois
economics
according
to
which
capital
of
one
becomes
the
income
of
another
and
adam
smith
was
responsible
for
this
confusion
which
was
then
elevated
to
an
axiom
by
say
in
justification
of
mental
inertia
and
superficiality
it
was
loyally
accepted
by
sismondi
nature
of
capital
and
of
income
are
always
confused
by
the
mind
we
see
that
what
is
income
for
one
becomes
capital
for
another
and
the
same
object
in
passing
from
hand
to
hand
successively
acquires
different
denominations
the
value
which
becomes
detached
from
an
object
that
has
been
consumed
appears
as
a
metaphysical
quantity
which
one
expends
and
the
other
exchanges
which
for
one
perishes
together
with
the
object
itself
and
which
for
the
other
renews
itself
and
lasts
for
the
time
of
circulation
after
this
promising
introduction
sismondi
dives
right
into
the
difficult
problem
and
declares
all
wealth
is
a
product
of
labour
income
is
part
of
wealth
and
must
therefore
have
the
same
origin
however
it
is
to
recognise
three
kinds
of
income
called
rent
profit
and
wage
respectively
which
spring
from
the
three
sources
of
accumulated
capital
and
labour
as
to
the
first
thesis
he
is
obviously
on
the
wrong
tack
as
the
wealth
of
a
society
as
the
aggregate
of
useful
objects
of
wealth
is
not
merely
a
product
of
labour
but
also
of
nature
who
both
supplies
raw
materials
and
provides
the
means
to
support
human
labour
income
on
the
other
hand
is
a
concept
of
value
it
indicates
the
amount
to
which
an
individual
or
individuals
can
dispose
over
part
of
the
wealth
of
society
or
of
the
aggregate
social
product
in
view
of
sismondi
insistence
that
social
income
is
part
of
social
wealth
we
might
assume
him
to
understand
by
social
income
the
actual
annual
fund
for
consumption
the
remaining
part
of
wealth
that
has
not
been
consumed
then
is
the
capital
of
society
thus
we
obtain
at
least
a
vague
outline
of
the
required
distinction
between
capital
and
income
on
a
social
basis
at
the
very
next
moment
however
sismondi
accepts
the
distinction
between
three
kinds
of
income
only
one
of
which
derives
exclusively
from
capital
while
in
the
other
two
or
are
conjoined
with
capital
the
concept
of
capital
thus
at
once
becomes
hazy
again
however
let
us
see
what
sismondi
has
to
say
about
the
origin
of
these
three
kinds
of
income
which
betray
a
rift
in
the
foundations
of
society
he
is
right
to
take
a
certain
development
of
labour
productivity
as
his
point
of
departure
reason
of
the
advances
both
in
industry
and
science
by
which
man
has
subjugated
the
forces
of
nature
every
worker
can
produce
more
far
more
in
a
day
than
he
needs
to
consume
sismondi
thus
rightly
stresses
the
fact
that
the
productivity
of
labour
is
an
indispensable
condition
for
the
historical
foundation
of
exploitation
yet
he
goes
on
to
explain
the
actual
origin
of
exploitation
in
a
way
typical
of
bourgeois
economics
even
though
his
labour
produces
wealth
this
wealth
if
he
is
called
upon
to
enjoy
it
will
make
him
less
and
less
fit
for
work
besides
wealth
hardly
ever
remains
in
the
possession
of
the
man
who
must
live
by
the
work
of
his
hands
thus
he
makes
exploitation
and
class
antagonism
the
necessary
spur
to
production
quite
in
accord
with
the
followers
of
ricardo
and
malthus
but
now
he
comes
to
the
real
cause
of
exploitation
the
divorce
of
labour
power
from
the
means
of
production
worker
can
not
as
a
rule
keep
the
land
as
his
own
land
however
has
a
productive
capacity
which
human
labour
but
directs
to
the
uses
of
man
the
master
of
the
land
on
which
labour
is
performed
reserves
a
share
in
the
fruits
of
labour
to
which
his
land
has
contributed
as
his
remuneration
for
the
benefits
afforded
by
this
productive
capacity
this
is
called
rent
and
further
our
state
of
civilisation
the
worker
can
no
longer
call
his
own
an
adequate
fund
of
objects
for
his
consumption
enough
to
live
while
he
performs
the
labours
he
has
undertaken
until
he
has
found
a
buyer
he
no
longer
owns
the
raw
materials
often
coming
from
far
away
on
which
he
must
exercise
his
industry
even
less
does
he
possess
that
complicated
and
costly
machinery
which
facilitates
his
work
and
makes
it
infinitely
more
productive
the
rich
man
who
possesses
his
consumption
goods
his
raw
materials
and
his
machines
need
not
work
himself
for
by
supplying
the
worker
with
all
these
he
becomes
in
a
sense
the
master
of
his
work
as
reward
for
the
advantages
he
has
put
at
the
worker
disposal
he
takes
outright
the
greater
part
of
the
fruits
of
his
labour
this
is
called
capital
profits
what
remains
of
wealth
after
the
cream
has
been
taken
off
twice
by
landlord
and
capitalist
is
the
wage
of
labour
the
income
of
the
worker
and
sismondi
adds
can
consume
it
without
reproduction
thus
sismondi
makes
the
fact
of
the
criterion
of
income
as
distinct
from
capital
for
wages
as
well
as
for
rent
in
this
however
he
is
only
right
with
regard
to
rent
and
the
consumed
part
of
capital
profits
as
for
the
part
of
the
social
product
which
is
consumed
in
form
of
wages
it
certainly
does
reproduce
itself
it
becomes
the
labour
power
of
the
wage
labourer
for
him
a
commodity
by
whose
sale
he
lives
which
he
can
bring
to
market
again
and
again
for
society
it
becomes
the
material
form
of
variable
capital
which
must
reappear
time
and
again
in
the
aggregate
reproduction
of
a
year
if
there
is
to
be
no
loss
so
far
so
good
hitherto
we
have
only
learned
two
facts
the
productivity
of
labour
permits
of
the
exploitation
of
the
workers
by
those
who
do
not
work
themselves
and
exploitation
becomes
the
actual
foundation
of
the
distribution
of
income
owing
to
the
divorce
of
the
worker
from
his
means
of
production
but
we
still
do
not
know
what
is
capital
and
what
income
and
sismondi
proceeds
to
clarify
this
point
starting
as
usual
with
robinson
crusoe
the
eyes
of
the
individual
all
wealth
was
nothing
but
a
provision
prepared
beforehand
for
the
time
of
need
even
so
he
already
distinguished
two
elements
in
this
provision
one
part
which
he
budgets
to
have
at
hand
for
immediate
or
almost
immediate
use
and
the
other
which
he
will
not
need
until
it
is
to
afford
him
new
production
thus
one
part
of
his
corn
must
feed
him
until
the
next
harvest
another
part
reserved
for
sowing
is
to
bear
fruit
the
following
year
the
formation
of
society
and
the
introduction
of
exchange
permit
to
increase
this
seed
this
fertile
part
of
accumulated
wealth
almost
indefinitely
and
this
is
what
is
called
capital
balderdash
would
be
a
better
name
for
all
this
in
using
the
analogy
of
seed
sismondi
here
identifies
means
of
production
and
capital
and
this
is
wrong
for
two
reasons
first
means
of
production
are
capital
not
intrinsically
but
only
under
quite
definite
historical
conditions
secondly
the
concept
of
capital
covers
more
than
just
the
means
of
production
in
capitalist
society
with
all
the
conditions
sismondi
ignores
the
means
of
production
are
only
a
part
of
capital
they
are
constant
capital
sismondi
here
lost
his
thread
plainly
because
he
tried
to
establish
a
connection
between
the
capital
concept
and
the
material
aspects
of
social
reproduction
earlier
so
long
as
he
was
concerned
with
the
individual
capitalist
he
listed
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
together
with
means
of
production
as
component
parts
of
capital
again
a
mistake
in
view
of
the
material
aspects
of
the
reproduction
of
individual
capitals
yet
as
soon
as
he
tries
to
focus
the
material
foundations
of
social
reproduction
and
sets
out
to
make
the
correct
distinction
between
consumer
goods
and
means
of
production
the
concept
of
capital
dissolves
in
his
hands
however
sismondi
well
knows
that
the
means
of
production
are
not
the
sole
requisites
for
production
and
exploitation
indeed
he
has
the
proper
instinct
that
the
core
of
the
relation
of
exploitation
is
the
very
fact
of
exchange
with
living
labour
having
just
reduced
capital
to
constant
capital
he
now
immediately
reduces
it
exclusively
to
variable
capital
the
farmer
has
put
in
reserve
all
the
corn
he
expects
to
need
till
the
next
harvest
he
will
find
a
good
use
for
the
surplus
corn
he
will
feed
what
he
has
left
over
to
other
people
who
are
going
to
work
for
him
till
his
land
spin
and
weave
his
hemp
and
wool
etc
by
this
procedure
the
farmer
converts
a
part
of
his
income
into
capital
and
in
fact
this
is
the
way
in
which
new
capital
is
always
formed
the
corn
he
has
reaped
over
and
above
what
he
must
eat
while
he
is
working
and
over
and
above
what
he
will
have
to
sow
in
order
to
maintain
the
same
level
of
exploitation
is
wealth
which
he
can
give
away
squander
and
consume
in
idleness
without
becoming
any
poorer
it
was
income
but
as
soon
as
he
uses
it
to
feed
producers
as
soon
as
he
exchanges
it
for
labour
or
for
the
fruits
to
come
from
the
work
of
his
labourers
his
weavers
his
miners
it
is
a
permanent
value
that
multiplies
and
will
no
longer
perish
it
is
capital
here
there
is
some
grain
mixed
up
with
quite
a
lot
of
chaff
constant
capital
seems
still
required
to
maintain
production
on
the
old
scale
although
it
is
strangely
reduced
to
circulating
capital
and
although
the
reproduction
of
fixed
capital
is
completely
ignored
circulating
capital
apparently
is
also
superfluous
for
the
expansion
of
reproduction
for
accumulation
the
whole
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
converted
into
wages
for
new
workers
who
evidently
labour
in
without
material
means
of
production
the
same
view
is
expressed
even
more
clearly
elsewhere
the
rich
man
cuts
down
his
income
in
order
to
add
to
his
capital
he
is
thus
conferring
a
benefit
on
the
poor
because
he
himself
shares
out
the
annual
product
and
whatever
he
calls
income
he
will
keep
for
his
own
consumption
whatever
he
calls
capital
he
gives
to
the
poor
man
to
constitute
an
income
for
him
yet
at
the
same
time
sismondi
gives
due
weight
to
the
of
and
the
origin
of
capital
surplus
value
arises
from
the
exchange
of
capital
for
labour
from
variable
capital
and
capital
arises
from
the
accumulation
of
surplus
value
with
all
this
however
we
have
not
made
much
progress
towards
a
distinction
between
capital
and
income
sismondi
now
attempts
to
represent
the
various
elements
of
production
and
income
in
terms
of
the
appropriate
parts
of
the
aggregate
social
product
employer
of
labour
as
also
the
labourer
does
not
use
all
his
productive
wealth
for
the
sowing
he
devotes
part
of
it
to
buildings
mills
and
tools
which
render
the
work
easier
and
more
productive
just
as
a
share
of
the
labourer
wealth
had
been
devoted
to
the
permanent
work
of
making
the
soil
more
fertile
thus
we
see
how
the
different
kinds
of
wealth
successively
come
into
being
and
become
distinct
one
part
of
the
wealth
accumulated
by
society
is
devoted
by
every
one
who
possesses
it
to
render
labour
more
profitable
by
slow
consumption
and
make
the
blind
forces
of
nature
execute
the
work
of
man
this
part
is
called
and
comprises
reclaiming
irrigation
factories
the
tools
of
trade
and
mechanical
contrivances
of
every
description
a
second
part
of
wealth
is
destined
for
immediate
consumption
to
reproduce
itself
in
the
work
it
gets
done
to
change
its
form
though
not
its
value
without
cease
this
part
is
called
and
it
comprises
seed
raw
materials
for
manufacture
and
wages
finally
a
third
part
of
wealth
becomes
distinguishable
from
the
second
it
is
the
value
by
which
the
finished
job
exceeds
the
advances
which
had
to
be
made
this
part
is
called
on
capitals
and
is
destined
to
be
consumed
without
reproduction
after
this
laborious
attempt
to
achieve
a
division
of
the
aggregate
social
production
according
to
incommensurable
categories
fixed
capital
circulating
capital
and
surplus
value
sismondi
soon
shows
unmistakable
signs
that
he
means
constant
capital
when
he
speaks
of
fixed
capital
and
variable
capital
when
he
speaks
of
circulating
capital
for
that
is
created
is
destined
for
human
consumption
though
fixed
capital
is
consumed
while
the
circulating
capital
into
the
consumption
fund
of
the
worker
whose
wage
it
forms
thus
we
are
a
little
nearer
to
the
division
of
the
social
product
into
constant
capital
means
of
production
variable
capital
provisions
for
the
workers
and
surplus
value
provisions
for
the
capitalists
but
so
far
sismondi
explanations
are
not
particularly
illuminating
on
the
subject
which
he
himself
describes
as
in
this
welter
of
confusion
at
any
rate
we
can
not
see
any
progress
beyond
adam
smith
thought
sismondi
feels
this
himself
and
would
clarify
the
problem
the
simplest
of
all
methods
sighing
that
movement
of
wealth
is
so
abstract
and
requires
such
great
power
of
concentration
to
grasp
it
properly
thus
again
we
put
on
blinkers
with
a
focus
on
robinson
crusoe
who
in
the
meantime
has
changed
to
the
extent
that
he
has
produced
a
family
and
is
now
a
pioneer
of
colonial
policy
solitary
farmer
in
a
distant
colony
on
the
border
of
the
desert
has
reaped
sacks
of
corn
this
year
there
is
no
market
where
to
bring
them
this
corn
in
any
case
must
be
consumed
within
the
year
else
it
will
be
of
no
value
to
the
farmer
yet
the
farmer
and
his
family
eat
only
sacks
of
it
this
will
be
his
expenditure
constituting
the
exchange
of
his
income
it
is
not
reproduced
for
anybody
whatever
then
he
will
call
for
workers
he
will
make
them
clear
woods
and
drain
swamps
in
his
neighbourhood
and
put
part
of
the
desert
under
the
plough
these
workers
will
eat
another
sacks
of
corn
this
will
be
their
expenditure
they
will
be
in
a
position
to
afford
this
expenditure
at
the
price
of
their
revenue
that
is
to
say
their
labour
for
the
farmer
it
will
be
an
exchange
he
will
have
converted
his
sacks
into
fixed
capital
in
the
end
he
is
left
with
sacks
he
will
sow
them
that
year
instead
of
the
he
had
sown
the
previous
year
this
constitutes
his
circulating
capital
which
he
will
have
doubled
thus
the
sacks
will
have
been
consumed
but
of
these
sacks
are
a
real
investment
for
him
which
will
reappear
with
great
increase
some
of
them
at
the
very
next
harvest
and
the
others
in
all
subsequent
the
very
isolation
of
the
farmer
we
have
just
assumed
gives
us
a
better
feeling
for
the
limitations
of
such
an
operation
if
he
has
only
found
consumers
for
of
the
sacks
harvested
in
that
year
who
is
going
to
eat
the
sacks
produced
the
following
year
by
the
increase
in
his
sowing
his
family
you
might
say
which
will
increase
no
doubt
but
human
generations
do
not
multiply
as
quickly
as
subsistence
if
our
farmer
had
hands
available
to
repeat
this
assumed
process
each
year
his
corn
harvest
will
be
doubled
every
year
and
his
family
could
at
the
most
be
doubled
once
in
years
though
the
example
is
naïve
the
vital
question
stands
out
clearly
in
the
end
where
are
the
buyers
for
the
surplus
value
that
has
been
capitalised
the
accumulation
of
capital
can
indefinitely
increase
the
production
of
the
society
but
what
about
the
consumption
of
society
this
is
determined
by
the
various
kinds
of
income
sismondi
explains
this
important
subject
in
chapter
v
of
book
ii
distribution
of
the
national
income
among
the
various
classes
of
citizens
in
a
resumed
effort
to
describe
the
components
of
the
social
product
this
aspect
the
national
income
is
composed
of
two
parts
and
no
more
the
one
consists
in
annual
production
the
profit
arising
from
wealth
the
second
is
the
capacity
for
work
which
springs
from
life
this
time
we
understand
by
wealth
both
territorial
possessions
and
capital
and
by
profit
the
net
income
accruing
to
the
owners
as
well
as
the
profit
of
the
capitalist
thus
all
the
means
of
production
are
separated
from
the
national
income
as
and
this
income
is
divided
into
surplus
value
and
labour
power
or
better
its
equivalent
the
variable
capital
this
then
though
still
far
too
vague
is
our
division
into
constant
capital
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
but
income
it
soon
transpires
means
for
sismondi
the
annual
aggregate
product
of
society
annual
production
or
the
result
of
all
the
nation
work
in
the
course
of
a
year
is
composed
of
two
parts
one
we
have
just
discussed
the
profit
resulting
from
wealth
the
other
is
the
capacity
for
work
which
is
assumed
to
equal
the
part
of
wealth
for
which
it
is
exchanged
or
the
subsistence
of
the
workers
the
aggregate
social
product
is
thus
resolved
in
terms
of
value
into
two
parts
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
constant
capital
has
disappeared
we
have
arrived
at
smith
dogma
that
the
commodity
price
is
resolved
into
or
is
composed
of
in
other
words
the
aggregate
product
consists
solely
of
consumer
goods
for
workers
and
capitalists
sismondi
then
goes
on
to
the
problem
of
realising
the
aggregate
product
on
the
one
hand
the
sum
total
of
incomes
in
a
society
consists
of
wages
capital
profits
and
rents
and
is
thus
represented
by
on
the
other
hand
the
aggregate
social
product
in
terms
of
value
is
equally
resolved
into
that
national
income
and
annual
production
balance
each
other
and
appear
as
equal
quantities
so
that
they
must
be
equal
in
value
production
is
consumed
altogether
during
the
year
but
in
part
by
the
workers
who
by
exchanging
their
labour
for
it
convert
it
into
capital
and
reproduce
it
in
part
by
the
capitalists
who
exchanging
their
income
for
it
annihilate
it
the
whole
of
the
annual
income
is
destined
to
be
exchanged
for
the
whole
of
annual
production
this
is
the
basis
on
which
in
the
sixth
chapter
of
book
ii
reciprocal
determination
of
production
and
consumption
sismondi
finally
sets
up
the
following
precise
law
of
reproduction
is
the
income
of
the
past
year
which
must
pay
for
the
production
of
the
present
year
if
this
is
true
how
can
there
be
any
accumulation
of
capital
if
the
aggregate
product
must
be
completely
consumed
by
the
workers
and
capitalists
we
obviously
remain
within
the
bounds
of
simple
reproduction
and
there
can
be
no
solution
to
the
problem
of
accumulation
sismondi
theory
in
fact
amounts
to
a
denial
of
the
possibility
of
accumulation
the
aggregate
social
demand
being
the
bulk
of
wages
given
to
the
workers
and
the
previous
consumption
of
the
capitalists
who
will
be
left
to
buy
the
surplus
product
if
reproduction
expands
on
this
count
sismondi
argues
that
accumulation
is
objectively
impossible
as
follows
happens
after
all
is
always
that
we
exchange
the
whole
of
production
for
the
whole
production
of
the
previous
year
besides
if
production
gradually
increases
the
exchange
at
the
same
time
as
it
improves
future
conditions
must
entail
a
small
loss
every
year
in
other
words
when
the
aggregate
product
is
realised
accumulation
is
bound
each
year
to
create
a
surplus
that
can
not
be
sold
sismondi
however
is
afraid
of
drawing
this
final
conclusion
and
prefers
a
course
necessitating
a
somewhat
obscure
subterfuge
this
loss
is
not
heavy
and
evenly
distributed
everyone
will
bear
with
it
without
complaining
about
his
income
this
is
what
constitutes
the
national
economy
and
the
series
of
such
small
sacrifices
increases
capital
and
common
wealth
if
on
the
other
hand
there
is
ruthless
accumulation
this
surplus
residue
becomes
a
public
calamity
and
the
result
is
a
crisis
thus
a
subterfuge
becomes
the
solution
of
sismondi
putting
the
dampers
on
accumulation
he
constantly
polemises
against
the
classical
school
which
advocates
unrestricted
development
of
the
productive
forces
and
expansion
of
production
and
his
whole
work
is
a
warning
against
the
fatal
consequences
of
giving
full
rein
to
the
desire
to
accumulate
sismondi
exposition
proves
that
he
was
unable
to
grasp
the
reproductive
process
as
a
whole
quite
apart
from
his
unsuccessful
attempt
to
distinguish
between
the
categories
of
capital
and
income
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
his
theory
of
reproduction
suffers
from
the
fundamental
error
he
took
over
from
adam
smith
the
idea
that
personal
consumption
absorbs
the
entire
annual
product
without
leaving
any
part
of
the
value
for
the
renewal
of
society
constant
capital
and
also
that
accumulation
consists
merely
of
the
transformation
of
capitalised
surplus
value
into
variable
capital
yet
if
later
critics
of
sismondi
the
russian
marxist
ilyin
think
that
pointing
out
this
fundamental
error
in
the
analysis
of
the
aggregate
product
can
justify
a
cavalier
dismissal
of
sismondi
entire
theory
of
accumulation
as
inadequate
as
they
merely
demonstrate
their
own
obtuseness
in
respect
of
sismondi
real
concern
his
ultimate
problem
the
analysis
of
marx
at
a
later
date
showing
up
the
crude
mistakes
of
adam
smith
for
the
first
time
is
the
best
proof
that
the
problem
of
accumulation
is
far
from
solved
just
by
attending
to
the
equivalent
of
the
constant
capital
in
the
aggregate
product
this
is
proved
even
more
strikingly
in
the
actual
development
of
sismondi
theory
his
views
involved
him
in
bitter
controversy
with
the
exponents
and
popularisers
of
the
classical
school
with
ricardo
say
and
macculloch
the
two
parties
to
the
conflict
represent
diametrically
opposed
points
of
view
sismondi
stands
for
the
sheer
impossibility
the
others
for
the
unrestricted
possibility
of
accumulation
sismondi
and
his
opponents
alike
disregard
constant
capital
in
their
exposition
of
reproduction
and
it
was
say
in
particular
who
presumed
to
perpetuate
adam
confused
concept
of
the
aggregate
product
as
as
an
unassailable
dogma
the
knowledge
we
owe
to
marx
that
the
aggregate
product
must
apart
from
consumer
goods
for
the
workers
and
capitalists
also
contain
means
of
production
to
renew
what
has
been
used
that
accumulation
accordingly
consists
not
merely
in
the
enlargement
of
variable
but
also
of
constant
capital
is
not
enough
as
amply
demonstrated
by
this
entertaining
turn
of
events
to
solve
the
problem
of
accumulation
later
we
shall
see
how
this
stress
on
the
share
of
constant
capital
in
the
reproductive
process
gave
rise
to
new
fallacies
in
the
theory
of
accumulation
at
present
it
will
suffice
to
put
on
record
that
the
deference
to
smith
error
about
the
reproduction
of
aggregate
capital
is
not
a
weakness
unique
to
sismondi
position
but
is
rather
the
common
ground
on
which
the
first
controversy
about
the
problem
of
accumulation
was
fought
out
scientific
research
not
only
in
this
sphere
proceeds
in
devious
ways
it
often
tackles
the
upper
storeys
of
the
edifice
as
it
were
without
making
sure
of
the
foundations
and
so
this
conflict
only
resulted
in
that
bourgeois
economics
took
on
the
further
complicated
problem
of
accumulation
without
even
having
assimilated
the
elementary
problem
of
simple
reproduction
at
all
events
sismondi
in
his
critique
of
accumulation
had
indubitably
given
bourgeois
economics
a
hard
nut
to
crack
seeing
that
in
spite
of
his
transparently
feeble
and
awkward
deductions
sismondi
opponents
were
still
unable
to
get
the
better
of

school
of
that
other
great
european
simon
who
had
stressed
the
conception
of
large
industrial
expansion
the
unlimited
unfolding
of
the
productive
forces
of
human
labour
felt
perturbed
by
sismondi
alarms
here
however
we
are
interested
in
the
controversy
between
sismondi
and
the
ricardians
which
proved
the
most
fruitful
from
the
theoretical
point
of
view
in
the
name
of
ricardo
and
it
seemed
with
ricardo
personal
approval
macculloch
anonymously
published
a
polemical
article
against
sismondi
in
the
in
october
immediately
after
the
publication
of
the
in
sismondi
replied
in
rossi
de
with
an
essay
entitled
the
power
of
consuming
necessarily
increase
with
the
power
to
produce
an
enquiry
in
his
reply
sismondi
himself
states
that
his
polemics
were
conceived
under
the
impact
of
the
commercial
crisis
truth
we
are
both
looking
for
is
of
utmost
importance
under
present
conditions
it
may
be
considered
as
fundamental
for
economics
universal
distress
is
in
evidence
in
the
trade
in
industry
and
in
many
countries
certainly
even
in
agriculture
such
prolonged
and
extraordinary
suffering
has
brought
misfortune
to
countless
families
and
insecurity
and
despondency
to
all
until
it
threatens
the
very
bases
of
the
social
order
two
contrasting
explanations
have
been
advanced
for
the
distress
that
has
caused
such
a
stir
some
say
we
have
produced
too
much
and
others
we
have
not
produced
enough
there
will
be
no
equilibrium
say
the
former
no
peace
and
no
prosperity
until
we
consume
the
entire
commodity
surplus
which
remains
unsold
on
the
market
until
we
organise
production
for
the
future
in
accordance
with
the
demand
there
will
be
a
new
equilibrium
say
the
latter
if
only
we
double
our
efforts
to
accumulate
as
well
as
to
produce
it
is
a
mistake
to
believe
that
there
is
a
glut
on
the
market
no
more
than
half
our
warehouses
are
full
let
us
fill
the
other
half
too
and
the
mutual
exchange
of
these
new
riches
will
revive
our
trade
in
this
supremely
lucid
way
sismondi
sets
out
and
underlines
the
real
crux
of
the
dispute
macculloch
whole
position
in
truth
stands
or
falls
with
the
statement
that
exchange
is
actually
an
interchange
of
commodities
every
commodity
accordingly
represents
not
only
supply
but
demand
the
dialogue
then
continues
as
follows
and
supply
are
truly
correlative
and
convertible
terms
the
supply
of
one
set
of
commodities
constitutes
the
demand
for
another
thus
there
is
a
demand
for
a
given
quantity
of
agricultural
produce
when
a
quantity
of
wrought
goods
equal
thereto
in
productive
cost
is
offered
in
exchange
for
it
and
conversely
there
is
an
effectual
demand
for
this
quantity
of
wrought
goods
when
the
supply
of
agricultural
produce
which
it
required
the
same
expense
to
raise
is
presented
as
its
equivalent
the
ricardian
dodge
is
obvious
he
has
chosen
to
ignore
the
circulation
of
money
and
to
pretend
that
commodities
are
immediately
bought
and
paid
for
by
commodities
from
the
conditions
of
highly
developed
capitalist
production
we
are
thus
suddenly
taken
to
a
stage
of
primitive
barter
such
as
we
might
find
still
flourishing
at
present
in
central
africa
there
is
a
distant
element
of
truth
in
this
trick
since
money
in
a
simple
circulation
of
commodities
plays
merely
the
part
of
an
agent
but
of
course
it
is
just
the
intervention
of
an
agent
which
separates
the
two
transactions
of
circulation
sale
and
purchase
and
makes
them
independent
of
one
another
in
respect
of
both
time
and
place
that
is
why
a
further
purchase
need
not
follow
hard
upon
a
sale
for
one
thing
and
secondly
sale
and
purchase
are
by
no
means
bound
up
with
the
same
people
in
fact
they
will
involve
the
same
performers
only
in
rare
and
exceptional
cases
macculloch
however
makes
just
this
baseless
assumption
by
confronting
as
buyer
and
seller
industry
on
the
one
hand
and
agriculture
on
the
other
the
universality
of
these
categories
total
categories
of
exchange
obscures
the
actual
splitting
up
of
this
social
division
of
labour
which
results
in
innumerable
private
exchange
transactions
where
the
sale
and
purchase
of
two
commodities
rarely
come
to
the
same
thing
macculloch
simplified
conception
of
commodity
exchange
in
general
which
immediately
turns
the
commodity
into
money
and
pretends
that
it
can
be
directly
exchanged
makes
it
impossible
to
understand
the
economic
significance
of
money
its
historical
appearance
sismondi
answer
to
this
is
regrettably
clumsy
in
order
to
show
that
macculloch
explanation
of
commodity
exchange
has
no
application
for
capitalist
production
he
takes
recourse
to
the
leipsic
book
fair
the
book
fair
of
leipsic
booksellers
from
all
over
germany
arrive
each
with
four
or
five
publications
of
his
own
in
some
or
dozen
copies
these
are
exchanged
for
others
and
every
seller
takes
home
dozen
books
just
as
he
has
brought
dozen
with
the
sole
difference
that
he
brought
four
different
works
and
takes
home
this
is
the
demand
and
the
production
which
according
to
ricardo
disciple
are
correlative
and
convertible
one
buys
the
other
one
pays
for
the
other
one
is
the
consequence
of
the
other
but
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
for
the
bookseller
and
for
the
general
public
demand
and
consumption
have
not
even
begun
for
all
that
it
has
changed
hands
at
leipsic
a
bad
book
will
still
be
just
as
unsold
a
bad
mistake
of
sismondi
this
it
will
still
clutter
up
the
merchants
shops
either
because
nobody
wants
it
or
because
everyone
has
a
copy
already
the
books
exchanged
at
leipsic
will
only
sell
if
the
booksellers
can
find
individuals
who
not
only
want
them
but
are
also
prepared
to
make
sacrifices
in
order
to
withdraw
them
from
circulation
they
alone
constitute
an
effective
demand
although
this
example
is
rather
crude
it
shows
clearly
that
sismondi
was
not
by
his
opponent
trick
that
he
knows
after
all
what
he
is
talking
about
macculloch
then
attempts
to
turn
the
examination
from
abstract
commodity
exchange
to
concrete
social
conditions
for
the
sake
of
illustration
that
a
cultivator
advanced
food
and
clothing
for
labourers
who
raised
for
him
for
while
a
also
advanced
food
and
clothing
for
who
fabricated
for
him
for
then
the
farmer
besides
replacing
the
food
of
his
own
labourers
would
have
food
for
to
dispose
of
while
the
manufacturer
after
replacing
the
clothing
of
his
own
labourers
would
have
clothing
for
to
bring
to
market
in
this
case
the
two
articles
would
be
exchanged
against
each
other
the
supply
of
food
constituting
the
demand
for
the
clothing
and
that
of
the
clothing
the
demand
for
the
food
what
are
we
to
admire
more
in
this
hypothesis
the
absurdity
of
the
which
reverses
all
actual
relations
or
the
effrontery
which
simply
takes
for
granted
in
the
premises
all
that
is
later
claimed
proved
in
order
to
prove
that
it
is
always
possible
to
create
an
unlimited
demand
for
all
kinds
of
goods
macculloch
chooses
for
his
example
two
commodities
which
pertain
to
the
most
urgent
and
elementary
wants
of
every
human
being
food
and
clothing
in
order
to
prove
that
commodities
may
be
exchanged
at
any
time
and
without
regard
to
the
needs
of
society
he
chooses
for
his
example
two
products
in
quantities
which
are
right
from
the
start
in
strict
conformity
with
these
needs
and
which
therefore
contain
no
surplus
as
far
as
society
is
concerned
and
yet
he
calls
this
quantity
needed
by
society
a
surplus
as
measured
against
the
producer
personal
requirements
for
his
own
product
and
is
consequently
able
to
demonstrate
brilliantly
that
any
amount
of
commodity
can
be
exchanged
for
a
corresponding
of
other
commodities
finally
in
order
to
prove
that
different
privately
produced
commodities
can
yet
be
exchanged
although
their
quantity
production
costs
and
social
importance
must
of
course
be
different
he
chooses
for
his
example
commodities
whose
quantity
production
cost
and
general
social
necessity
are
precisely
the
same
right
from
the
start
in
short
macculloch
posits
a
planned
strictly
regulated
production
without
any
in
order
to
prove
that
no
crisis
is
possible
in
an
unplanned
private
economy
the
principal
joke
of
canny
mac
however
lies
elsewhere
what
is
at
issue
is
the
problem
of
accumulation
sismondi
was
worried
by
and
worried
ricardo
and
his
followers
with
the
following
question
if
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
capitalised
used
to
expand
production
over
and
above
the
income
of
society
instead
of
being
privately
consumed
by
the
capitalists
where
are
we
to
find
buyers
for
the
commodity
surplus
what
will
become
of
the
capitalised
surplus
value
who
will
buy
the
commodities
in
which
it
is
hidden
thus
sismondi
and
the
flower
of
ricardo
school
its
official
representative
on
the
chair
of
london
university
the
authority
for
the
then
english
ministers
of
the
liberal
party
and
for
the
city
of
london
the
great
macculloch
replies
by
constructing
an
example
in
which
no
surplus
value
whatever
is
produced
his
slave
away
in
agriculture
and
industry
in
the
name
of
charity
and
all
the
time
the
entire
social
product
including
the
is
only
enough
for
the
needs
of
the
workers
for
the
wages
while
the
and
see
to
production
and
exchange
without
food
and
clothing
sismondi
justly
impatient
now
exclaims
moment
we
want
to
find
out
what
is
to
constitute
the
surplus
of
production
over
consumption
of
the
workers
it
will
not
do
to
abstract
from
that
surplus
which
forms
the
due
profit
of
labour
and
the
due
share
of
the
master
macculloch
only
reaction
is
to
multiply
his
silly
argument
by
a
thousand
he
asks
the
reader
to
assume
farmers
and
all
acting
as
ingenuously
as
the
individuals
the
exchange
then
proceeds
as
smoothly
as
can
be
desired
finally
he
exactly
doubles
labour
productivity
consequence
of
more
skilful
application
of
labour
and
of
the
introduction
of
machinery
thus
that
every
one
of
the
farmers
by
advancing
food
and
clothing
for
labourers
obtains
a
return
consisting
of
ordinary
food
for
together
with
sugar
grapes
and
tobacco
equal
in
production
cost
to
that
food
while
every
manufacturer
obtains
by
an
analogous
procedure
in
addition
to
the
previous
quantity
of
clothing
for
all
workers
cambrics
and
lace
equal
in
productive
cost
and
therefore
in
exchangeable
value
to
that
clothing
after
such
complete
reversal
of
the
chronological
order
the
assumption
that
is
of
first
the
existence
of
private
property
with
wage
labour
and
then
at
a
later
stage
such
level
of
labour
productivity
as
makes
exploitation
possible
at
all
he
now
assumes
labour
productivity
to
progress
with
equal
speed
in
all
spheres
the
surplus
product
to
contain
precisely
the
same
amount
of
value
in
all
branches
of
industry
and
to
be
divided
among
precisely
the
same
number
of
people
when
these
various
surplus
products
are
then
exchanged
against
one
another
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
exchange
proceeds
smoothly
and
completely
to
everybody
satisfaction
it
is
only
another
of
his
many
absurdities
that
macculloch
makes
the
capitalists
who
had
hitherto
lived
on
air
and
exercised
their
profession
in
their
birthday
suits
now
live
exclusively
on
sugar
tobacco
and
wine
and
array
themselves
only
in
ribbons
cambrics
and
lace
the
most
ridiculous
performance
however
is
the
by
which
he
evades
the
real
problem
the
question
had
been
what
happens
to
the
capitalist
surplus
that
surplus
which
is
used
not
for
the
own
consumption
but
for
the
expansion
of
production
macculloch
solves
it
on
the
one
hand
by
ignoring
the
production
of
surplus
value
altogether
and
on
the
other
by
using
all
surplus
value
in
the
production
of
luxury
goods
what
buyers
then
does
he
advance
for
this
new
luxury
production
the
capitalists
evidently
the
farmers
and
manufacturers
since
apart
from
these
there
are
only
workers
in
macculloch
model
thus
the
entire
surplus
value
is
consumed
for
the
personal
satisfaction
of
the
capitalists
that
is
to
say
simple
reproduction
takes
place
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
the
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
is
according
to
macculloch
either
to
ignore
surplus
value
altogether
or
to
assume
simple
reproduction
instead
of
accumulation
as
soon
as
surplus
value
comes
into
being
he
still
to
speak
of
expanding
reproduction
but
again
as
before
when
he
pretended
to
deal
with
the
he
uses
a
trick
first
setting
out
an
impossible
species
of
capitalist
production
without
any
surplus
value
and
then
persuading
the
reader
that
the
subsequent
of
the
surplus
value
constitutes
an
expansion
of
production
sismondi
is
not
quite
up
to
these
scottish
acrobatics
he
had
up
to
now
succeeded
in
pinning
his
mac
down
proving
him
to
be
absurd
but
now
he
himself
becomes
confused
with
regard
to
the
crucial
point
at
issue
on
the
above
rantings
of
his
opponent
he
should
have
declared
coldly
sir
with
all
respect
for
the
flexibility
of
your
mind
you
are
dodging
the
issue
i
keep
on
asking
who
will
buy
the
surplus
product
if
the
capitalists
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
accumulation
to
expand
production
instead
of
squandering
it
altogether
and
you
reply
oh
well
they
will
expand
their
production
of
luxury
goods
which
they
will
of
course
eat
up
themselves
but
this
is
a
conjuring
trick
seeing
that
the
capitalists
consume
the
surplus
value
in
so
far
as
they
spend
it
on
their
luxuries
they
do
not
accumulate
at
all
my
question
is
about
the
possibility
of
accumulation
not
whether
the
personal
luxuries
of
the
capitalists
are
possible
answer
this
clearly
if
you
can
or
else
go
play
with
your
wine
and
tobacco
or
go
to
blazes
for
all
i
care
but
sismondi
instead
of
putting
the
screws
on
the
vulgariser
suddenly
begins
to
moralise
with
pathos
and
social
conscience
he
exclaims
demand
whose
satisfaction
the
masters
or
the
workers
in
town
or
country
on
this
new
conception
of
mac
there
is
a
surplus
of
products
an
advantage
from
labour
to
whom
will
it
accrue
and
gives
his
own
answer
in
the
following
impassioned
words
we
know
full
well
and
the
history
of
the
commercial
world
teaches
us
all
too
thoroughly
that
it
is
not
the
worker
who
profits
from
the
increase
in
products
and
labour
his
pay
is
not
in
the
least
swelled
by
it
ricardo
himself
said
formerly
that
it
ought
not
to
be
unless
you
want
the
social
wealth
to
stop
growing
on
the
contrary
sorry
experience
teaches
us
that
wages
nearly
always
contract
by
very
reason
of
this
increase
where
then
does
the
accumulation
of
wealth
make
itself
felt
as
a
public
benefit
our
author
assumes
farmers
who
profit
while
workers
toil
entrepreneurs
who
wax
rich
while
artisans
are
kept
under
their
orders
whatever
good
may
result
from
the
accumulation
of
the
frivolous
enjoyment
of
luxuries
is
only
felt
by
a
part
of
the
nation
and
will
this
part
called
upon
to
consume
the
entire
surplus
product
of
the
whole
working
class
be
adequate
to
a
production
that
may
grow
without
let
or
hindrance
owing
to
progress
of
machinery
and
capitals
in
the
assumption
made
by
the
author
every
time
the
national
product
is
doubled
the
master
of
the
farm
or
of
the
factory
must
increase
his
consumption
a
hundredfold
if
the
national
wealth
thanks
to
the
invention
of
so
many
machines
is
a
hundred
times
what
it
was
when
it
only
covered
the
cost
of
production
every
employer
would
have
to
consume
enough
products
to
support
workers
at
this
point
sismondi
again
believes
himself
to
have
a
firm
grasp
on
how
crises
begin
to
arise
might
imagine
if
put
to
it
that
a
rich
man
can
consume
the
goods
manufactured
by
workers
this
being
the
fate
of
the
ribbons
lace
and
cambrics
whose
origin
the
author
has
shown
us
but
a
single
individual
would
not
know
how
to
consume
agricultural
product
to
the
same
tune
the
wines
sugar
and
spices
which
ricardo
whom
sismondi
evidently
suspected
of
having
written
the
article
since
he
only
got
to
know
of
the
at
a
later
date
conjures
up
in
exchange
are
too
much
for
the
table
of
one
man
they
will
not
sell
or
else
the
strict
proportion
between
agricultural
and
industrial
products
apparently
the
basis
of
his
whole
system
can
not
be
maintained
sismondi
we
see
has
thus
fallen
into
macculloch
trap
instead
of
waiving
an
answer
to
the
problem
of
accumulation
which
refers
to
the
production
of
luxuries
he
pursues
his
opponent
into
this
field
without
noticing
that
the
ground
under
his
feet
has
shifted
here
he
finds
two
causes
for
complaint
for
one
thing
he
has
moral
objections
to
macculloch
allowing
the
capitalists
instead
of
the
workers
to
benefit
by
the
surplus
value
and
is
into
polemising
against
distribution
under
capitalism
from
this
digression
he
unexpectedly
reverts
to
the
original
problem
which
he
now
formulates
as
follows
the
capitalists
then
consume
the
entire
surplus
value
in
luxuries
let
it
be
so
but
could
anyone
increase
his
consumption
as
rapidly
and
indefinitely
as
the
progress
of
labour
productivity
makes
the
surplus
value
increase
and
in
this
second
instance
sismondi
himself
abandons
his
own
problem
instead
of
perceiving
that
it
is
the
lack
of
consumers
other
than
workers
and
capitalists
which
accounts
for
the
difficulty
in
capitalist
accumulation
he
discovers
a
snag
in
simple
reproduction
because
the
capitalists
capacity
to
consume
has
physical
limits
since
the
absorptive
capacity
of
the
capitalists
for
luxuries
can
not
keep
up
with
labour
productivity
that
is
to
say
with
the
increase
in
surplus
value
there
must
be
crises
and
we
have
encountered
this
line
of
thought
once
before
in
the
so
sismondi
himself
was
manifestly
not
quite
clear
about
the
problem
at
all
times
and
that
is
hardly
surprising
since
one
can
really
come
to
grips
with
the
whole
problem
of
accumulation
only
when
one
has
fully
grasped
the
problem
of
simple
reproduction
and
we
have
seen
how
much
sismondi
was
at
fault
in
this
respect
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
the
first
time
that
sismondi
crossed
swords
with
the
heirs
of
the
classical
school
he
proved
himself
by
no
means
the
weaker
party
on
the
contrary
in
the
end
he
routed
his
opponent
if
sismondi
misunderstood
the
most
elementary
principles
of
social
reproduction
and
ignored
constant
capital
quite
in
keeping
with
adam
smith
dogma
he
was
in
this
respect
no
worse
at
any
rate
than
his
opponent
constant
capital
does
not
exist
for
macculloch
either
his
farmers
and
manufacturers
merely
food
and
clothing
to
their
workers
and
food
and
clothing
between
them
make
up
the
aggregate
product
of
society
if
there
is
then
nothing
to
choose
between
the
two
as
far
as
this
elementary
blunder
is
concerned
sismondi
towers
heads
above
mac
because
of
his
intuitive
understanding
of
the
contradictions
in
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
in
the
end
the
ricardian
was
at
a
loss
to
answer
sismondi
scepticism
concerning
the
possibility
of
realising
the
surplus
value
sismondi
also
shows
himself
more
penetrating
in
that
he
throws
the
nottingham
proletarians
cry
of
distress
in
the
teeth
of
the
apostles
and
apologists
of
harmony
with
their
smug
complacency
of
those
who
deny
surplus
of
production
over
demand
any
congestion
of
the
market
any
suffering
when
he
proves
that
the
introduction
of
the
machine
must
of
necessity
create
a
population
and
particularly
in
the
end
when
he
underlines
the
tendency
of
the
capitalist
world
market
in
general
with
its
inherent
contradictions
macculloch
denies
outright
that
general
is
possible
he
has
a
specific
for
every
partial
up
his
sleeve
may
be
objected
perhaps
that
on
the
principle
that
the
demand
for
commodities
increases
in
the
same
ratio
as
their
supply
there
is
no
accounting
for
the
gluts
and
stagnation
produced
by
overtrading
we
answer
very
easily
a
glut
is
an
increase
in
the
supply
of
a
particular
class
of
commodities
unaccompanied
by
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
supply
of
those
other
commodities
which
should
serve
as
their
equivalents
while
our
farmers
and
are
exchanging
their
respective
surplus
products
and
reciprocally
affording
a
market
to
each
other
if
new
capitalists
were
to
join
their
society
employing
each
labourers
in
tillage
there
would
be
an
immediate
glut
in
agricultural
produce
because
in
this
case
there
would
be
no
contemporaneous
increase
in
the
supply
of
the
manufactured
articles
which
should
purchase
it
but
let
one
half
of
the
new
capitalists
become
manufacturers
and
equivalents
in
the
form
of
wrought
goods
will
be
created
for
the
new
produce
raised
by
the
other
half
the
equilibrium
will
be
restored
and
the
farmers
and
will
exchange
their
respective
surplus
products
with
exactly
the
same
facility
with
which
the
farmers
and
manufacturers
formerly
exchanged
theirs
sismondi
answers
this
buffoonery
which
easily
pokes
about
in
a
fog
by
pointing
to
the
real
changes
and
revolutions
which
take
place
before
his
own
eyes
was
possible
to
put
barbarous
countries
under
the
plough
and
political
revolutions
changes
in
the
financial
system
and
peace
at
once
brought
cargoes
to
the
ports
of
the
old
agricultural
countries
which
almost
equalled
their
entire
harvest
the
recent
russian
conquest
of
the
vast
provinces
on
the
black
sea
the
change
in
the
system
of
government
in
egypt
and
the
outlawing
of
piracy
in
high
barbary
have
suddenly
poured
the
granaries
of
odessa
alexandria
and
tunis
into
the
italian
ports
and
have
put
such
an
abundance
of
corn
on
the
markets
that
all
along
the
coasts
the
farmer
trade
is
fighting
a
losing
battle
nor
is
the
remainder
of
europe
safe
from
a
similar
revolution
caused
by
the
simultaneous
ploughing
under
of
immense
expanses
of
new
land
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
which
export
all
their
agricultural
produce
even
the
influence
of
new
holland
may
one
day
be
the
ruin
of
english
industry
if
not
in
the
price
of
foodstuffs
which
are
too
expensive
to
transport
at
least
in
respect
of
wool
and
other
agricultural
products
which
are
easier
to
transport
what
would
macculloch
have
to
advise
in
view
of
such
an
agrarian
crisis
in
southern
europe
that
half
the
new
farmers
should
turn
manufacturer
whereupon
sismondi
counters
counsel
can
not
seriously
apply
to
the
tartars
of
the
crimea
or
to
the
fellaheen
of
egypt
and
he
adds
time
is
not
yet
ripe
to
set
up
new
industries
in
the
regions
oversea
or
in
new
holland
sismondi
acuity
recognised
that
industrialisation
of
the
lands
overseas
was
only
a
matter
of
time
he
was
equally
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
expansion
of
the
world
market
would
not
bring
with
it
the
solution
to
the
difficulty
but
would
only
reproduce
it
in
a
higher
degree
in
yet
more
potent
crises
his
prediction
for
the
expansive
tendency
of
capitalism
is
that
it
will
reveal
an
aspect
of
fiercer
and
fiercer
competition
of
mounting
anarchy
within
production
itself
indeed
he
puts
his
finger
on
the
fundamental
causes
of
crises
in
a
passage
where
he
states
the
trend
of
capitalist
production
precisely
as
surpassing
all
limits
of
the
market
at
the
end
of
his
reply
to
macculloch
he
says
and
again
it
has
been
proclaimed
that
the
equilibrium
will
itself
that
work
will
start
again
but
a
single
demand
each
time
provides
an
impetus
in
excess
of
the
real
needs
of
trade
and
this
new
activity
must
soon
be
followed
by
a
yet
more
painful
glut
to
such
a
profound
grasp
of
the
real
contradictions
in
the
movements
of
capital
the

from

the
author
proceeds
to
sismondi
and
formulates
the
point
of
contention
as
follows
owen
conceives
that
when
competition
is
unchecked
by
any
artificial
regulations
and
industry
permitted
to
flow
in
its
natural
channels
the
use
of
machinery
may
increase
the
supply
of
the
several
articles
of
wealth
beyond
the
demand
for
them
and
by
creating
an
excess
of
all
commodities
throw
the
working
classes
out
of
employment
this
is
the
position
which
we
hold
to
be
fundamentally
erroneous
and
as
it
is
strongly
insisted
on
by
the
celebrated
de
sismondi
in
his
principes
we
must
entreat
the
indulgence
of
our
readers
while
we
endeavour
to
point
out
its
fallacy
and
to
demonstrate
that

necessarily
increases

ricardo
sismondi
macculloch
reply
to
sismondi
theoretical
objections
evidently
did
not
settle
the
matter
to
ricardo
own
satisfaction
unlike
that
shrewd
as
marx
calls
him
ricardo
really
wanted
to
discover
the
truth
and
throughout
retained
the
genuine
modesty
of
a
great
mind
that
sismondi
polemics
against
him
and
his
pupil
had
made
a
deep
impression
is
proved
by
ricardo
revised
approach
to
the
question
of
the
effects
of
the
machine
that
being
the
point
on
which
sismondi
to
his
eternal
credit
had
confronted
the
classical
school
of
harmony
with
the
sinister
aspects
of
capitalism
ricardo
followers
had
enlarged
upon
the
doctrine
that
the
machine
can
always
create
as
many
or
even
more
opportunities
for
the
wage
labourers
as
it
takes
away
by
displacing
living
labour
this
theory
of
compensation
was
subjected
to
a
stern
attack
by
sismondi
in
the
chapter
the
division
of
labour
and
machinery
and
in
another
chapter
significantly
entitled
creates
a
surplus
population
both
published
in
the
of
two
years
later
than
ricardo
main
work
in
after
the
controversy
ricardo
inserted
a
new
chapter
in
the
third
edition
of
his
where
he
frankly
confesses
to
his
error
and
says
in
the
strain
of
sismondi
the
opinion
entertained
by
the
labouring
classes
that
the
employment
of
machinery
is
frequently
detrimental
to
their
interests
is
not
founded
on
prejudice
and
error
but
is
conformable
to
the
correct
principles
of
political
economy
he
like
sismondi
had
to
defend
himself
against
the
suspicion
that
he
is
opposing
technical
progress
but
less
ruthless
he
compromises
with
the
evasion
that
the
evil
emerges
only
gradually
elucidate
the
principle
i
have
been
supposing
that
improved
machinery
is
discovered
and
extensively
used
but
the
truth
is
that
these
discoveries
are
gradual
and
rather
operate
in
determining
the
employment
of
the
capital
which
is
saved
and
accumulated
than
in
diverting
capital
from
its
actual
employment
yet
the
problem
of
crises
and
accumulation
continued
to
worry
ricardo
also
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
spent
some
days
in
geneva
in
order
to
talk
the
problem
over
face
to
face
with
sismondi
the
result
of
these
talks
is
sismondi
essay
the
balance
between
consumption
and
production
published
in
the
of
may
in
his
ricardo
had
at
the
crucial
points
completely
accepted
say
trite
doctrine
of
harmony
in
the
relations
between
production
and
consumption
in
chapter
xxi
he
had
declared
say
has
however
most
satisfactorily
shown
that
there
is
no
amount
of
capital
which
may
not
be
employed
in
a
country
because
demand
is
only
limited
by
production
no
man
produces
but
with
a
view
to
consume
or
sell
and
he
never
sells
but
with
an
intention
to
purchase
some
other
commodity
which
may
be
immediately
useful
to
him
or
which
may
contribute
to
future
production
by
producing
then
he
necessarily
becomes
either
the
consumer
of
his
own
goods
or
the
purchaser
and
consumer
of
the
goods
of
some
other
person
to
this
conception
of
ricardo
sismondi
were
a
powerful
challenge
and
the
dispute
as
a
whole
turned
also
on
this
point
ricardo
could
not
deny
the
fact
of
crises
which
had
but
recently
passed
over
england
and
other
countries
what
was
at
issue
was
the
explanation
for
them
right
at
the
outset
of
their
debate
sismondi
and
ricardo
had
agreed
on
a
remarkably
lucid
and
precise
formulation
of
the
problem
excluding
the
question
of
foreign
commerce
altogether
sismondi
grasped
the
significance
and
necessity
of
foreign
trade
for
capitalist
production
its
need
for
expansion
well
enough
in
this
line
he
was
quite
in
step
with
ricardo
free
traders
whom
he
considerably
excelled
in
his
dialectical
conception
of
the
expansionist
needs
of
capital
he
fully
admitted
that
industry
increasingly
led
to
look
for
its
vents
on
foreign
markets
where
it
is
threatened
by
greater
revolutions
he
forecast
as
we
have
seen
the
rise
of
a
dangerous
competition
for
european
industry
in
the
overseas
countries
this
was
after
all
a
creditable
achievement
in
the
year
and
one
which
reveals
sismondi
deep
insight
into
the
relations
of
capitalist
world
economy
but
even
so
sismondi
was
in
fact
far
from
conceiving
the
problem
of
realising
the
surplus
value
the
problem
of
accumulation
to
depend
on
foreign
commerce
as
its
only
means
of
salvation
a
view
attributed
to
him
by
later
critics
on
the
contrary
sismondi
was
quite
explicit
in
the
sixth
chapter
of
volume
i
order
to
make
these
calculations
with
greater
certainty
and
to
simplify
these
questions
we
have
hitherto
made
complete
abstraction
from
foreign
trade
and
supposed
an
isolated
nation
this
isolated
nation
is
human
society
itself
and
what
is
true
for
a
nation
without
foreign
commerce
is
equally
true
for
mankind
in
other
words
in
considering
the
entire
world
market
as
one
society
producing
exclusively
by
capitalist
methods
sismondi
grounds
his
problem
in
the
same
premises
as
marx
was
to
do
after
him
that
was
also
the
basis
on
which
he
came
to
terms
with
ricardo
the
question
that
troubled
us
we
had
each
of
us
dismissed
the
instance
of
a
nation
that
sold
more
abroad
than
it
needed
to
buy
there
that
could
command
a
growing
external
market
for
its
growing
internal
production
in
any
case
it
is
not
for
us
to
decide
whether
fortunes
of
war
or
politics
could
perhaps
bring
forth
new
consumers
for
a
nation
what
is
needed
is
proof
that
a
nation
can
create
these
for
itself
simply
by
increasing
its
production
this
is
how
sismondi
formulated
the
problem
of
realising
the
surplus
value
in
all
precision
just
as
it
confronts
us
throughout
the
ensuing
era
in
economics
in
contrast
with
ricardo
who
actually
maintains
along
with
say
as
we
are
already
aware
and
shall
show
in
further
detail
that
production
creates
its
own
demand
ricardo
thesis
in
the
controversy
with
sismondi
takes
the
following
form
that
workers
produce
sacks
of
corn
and
weavers
yards
woollen
fabric
let
us
disregard
all
other
products
useful
to
man
and
all
intermediaries
between
them
and
consider
them
alone
in
the
world
they
exchange
their
yards
against
the
sacks
supposing
that
the
productive
power
of
labour
has
increased
by
a
tenth
owing
to
a
successive
progress
of
industry
the
same
people
will
exchange
yards
against
sacks
and
each
will
be
better
clothed
and
fed
new
progress
will
make
them
exchange
yards
for
sacks
and
so
on
the
increase
in
products
always
only
increases
the
enjoyment
of
those
who
produce
the
great
ricardo
standards
of
reasoning
it
must
regretfully
be
stated
are
if
anything
even
lower
than
those
of
the
scottish
macculloch
once
again
we
are
invited
to
witness
a
harmonious
and
graceful
of
sacks
and
yards
the
very
proportion
which
is
to
be
proved
is
again
taken
for
granted
what
is
more
all
relevant
premises
for
the
problem
are
simply
left
out
the
real
problem
you
will
recollect
the
object
of
the
controversy
had
been
the
question
who
are
the
buyers
and
consumers
of
the
surplus
product
that
comes
into
being
if
the
capitalists
produce
more
goods
than
are
needed
for
their
own
and
their
workers
consumption
if
that
is
to
say
they
capitalise
part
of
their
surplus
value
and
use
it
to
expand
production
to
increase
their
capital
ricardo
answers
it
by
completely
ignoring
the
capital
increase
the
picture
he
paints
of
the
various
stages
of
production
is
merely
that
of
a
gradually
increasing
productivity
of
labour
according
to
his
assumptions
the
same
amount
of
labour
first
produces
sacks
and
yards
textiles
then
sacks
and
yards
further
sacks
and
yards
and
so
on
in
a
gracefully
ascending
curve
not
only
that
the
image
of
a
marshalled
uniform
progression
on
both
sides
of
conformity
even
in
the
number
of
objects
brought
to
exchange
is
wearisome
the
expansion
of
capital
is
nowhere
as
much
as
mentioned
in
the
model
here
we
have
no
enlarged
but
simple
reproduction
with
a
greater
bulk
of
indeed
but
without
any
increase
in
the
value
of
the
aggregate
social
product
since
only
the
amount
of
value
not
the
number
of
is
relevant
to
the
exchange
transaction
and
this
amount
remains
constant
in
the
example
ricardo
makes
no
real
advances
even
though
he
seems
to
analyse
the
progressive
expansion
of
production
finally
he
is
quite
oblivious
of
the
relevant
categories
of
reproduction
macculloch
had
begun
by
making
the
capitalists
produce
without
any
surplus
value
and
live
on
air
but
at
least
he
recognised
the
existence
of
the
workers
making
provision
for
their
consumption
ricardo
however
does
not
even
mention
the
workers
for
him
the
distinction
between
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
does
not
exist
at
all
besides
this
major
omission
it
is
of
small
account
that
he
just
like
his
disciple
takes
no
notice
of
constant
capital
he
wants
to
solve
the
problem
of
realising
the
surplus
value
and
expanding
capital
without
positing
more
than
the
existence
of
a
certain
quantity
of
commodities
which
are
mutually
exchanged
sismondi
was
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
venue
has
been
changed
altogether
yet
he
tried
faithfully
to
bring
the
fantasies
of
his
famous
guest
and
opponent
down
to
earth
and
to
analyse
their
invisible
contradictions
plaintively
saying
that
these
assumptions
like
german
metaphysics
abstract
from
time
and
space
he
grafts
ricardo
hypothesis
on
to
in
its
real
organisation
with
unpropertied
workers
whose
wage
is
fixed
by
competition
and
who
can
be
dismissed
the
moment
their
master
has
no
further
need
of
their
work
for
remarks
sismondi
as
acute
as
he
is
modest
is
just
this
social
organisation
to
which
our
objection
refers
he
lays
bare
the
many
difficulties
and
conflicts
bound
up
with
the
progress
of
labour
productivity
under
capitalism
and
shows
that
ricardo
postulated
changes
in
the
technique
of
labour
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
lead
to
the
following
alternative
either
a
number
of
workers
corresponding
to
the
increase
in
labour
productivity
will
have
to
be
dismissed
outright
then
there
will
be
a
surplus
of
products
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
unemployment
and
misery
a
faithful
picture
of
society
or
the
surplus
product
will
be
used
for
the
maintenance
of
the
workers
in
a
new
field
of
production
the
production
of
luxury
goods
here
sismondi
undoubtedly
proves
himself
superior
he
suddenly
remembers
the
existence
of
the
constant
capital
and
now
it
is
he
who
subjects
the
english
classic
to
a
frontal
attack
setting
up
a
new
industry
for
manufacturing
luxuries
new
capital
is
also
needed
machines
will
have
to
be
built
raw
materials
procured
and
distant
commerce
brought
into
activity
for
the
wealthy
are
rarely
content
with
enjoying
what
is
immediately
in
front
of
them
where
then
could
we
find
this
new
capital
which
may
perhaps
be
much
more
considerable
than
that
required
by
agriculture
our
luxury
workers
are
still
a
long
way
from
eating
our
labourers
grain
from
wearing
the
clothes
from
our
common
factories
they
are
not
yet
made
into
workers
they
may
not
even
have
been
born
yet
their
trade
does
not
exist
the
materials
on
which
they
are
to
work
have
not
arrived
from
india
all
those
among
whom
the
former
should
distribute
their
bread
wait
for
it
in
vain
sismondi
now
takes
constant
capital
into
account
not
only
in
the
production
of
luxuries
but
also
in
agriculture
and
further
raises
the
following
objection
against
ricardo
must
abstract
from
time
if
we
make
the
assumption
that
the
cultivator
whom
a
mechanical
discovery
or
an
invention
of
rural
industry
enables
to
treble
the
productive
power
of
his
workers
will
also
find
sufficient
capital
to
treble
his
exploitation
his
agricultural
implements
his
equipment
his
livestock
his
granaries
to
treble
the
circulating
capital
which
must
serve
him
while
waiting
for
his
harvest
in
this
way
sismondi
breaks
with
the
superstition
of
the
classical
school
that
with
capital
expanding
all
additional
capital
would
be
exclusively
spent
on
wages
on
the
variable
capital
he
clearly
dissents
from
ricardo
doctrine
which
did
not
however
prevent
his
allowing
all
the
errors
arising
out
of
this
doctrine
three
years
later
again
to
creep
into
the
second
edition
of
his
in
opposition
to
ricardo
facile
doctrine
of
harmony
sismondi
underlines
two
decisive
points
on
the
one
hand
the
objective
difficulties
of
the
process
of
enlarged
reproduction
which
works
by
no
means
so
smoothly
in
capitalist
reality
as
it
does
in
ricardo
absurd
hypothesis
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
all
technical
progress
in
social
labour
productivity
is
always
achieved
under
capitalism
at
the
expense
of
the
working
class
bought
with
their
suffering
sismondi
shows
himself
superior
to
ricardo
in
yet
a
third
point
he
represents
the
broad
horizon
of
the
dialectical
approach
as
against
ricardo
blunt
with
its
incapacity
to
conceive
of
any
forms
of
society
other
than
those
of
bourgeois
economics
eyes
he
exclaims
so
accustomed
to
this
new
organisation
of
society
this
universal
competition
degenerating
into
hostility
between
the
rich
and
the
working
class
that
we
no
longer
conceive
of
any
mode
of
existence
other
than
that
whose
ruins
surround
us
on
all
sides
they
believe
to
prove
me
absurd
by
confronting
me
with
the
vices
of
preceding
systems
indeed
as
regards
the
organisation
of
the
lower
classes
two
or
three
systems
have
succeeded
one
another
yet
since
they
are
not
to
be
regretted
since
after
first
doing
some
good
they
then
imposed
terrible
disasters
on
mankind
may
we
conclude
from
this
that
we
have
now
entered
the
true
one
may
we
conclude
that
we
shall
not
discover
the
besetting
vice
of
the
system
of
wage
labour
as
we
have
discovered
that
of
slavery
of
vassalage
and
of
the
guilds
a
time
will
come
no
doubt
when
our
descendants
will
condemn
us
as
barbarians
because
we
have
left
the
working
classes
without
security
just
as
we
already
condemn
as
they
also
will
as
barbarian
the
nations
who
have
reduced
those
same
classes
to
slavery
sismondi
statement
putting
in
a
nutshell
the
vital
differences
between
the
parts
played
by
the
proletariat
in
a
modern
society
and
in
the
society
of
ancient
rome
shows
his
profound
insight
into
historical
connections
he
shows
no
less
discernment
in
his
polemics
against
ricardo
when
analysing
the
specific
economic
character
of
the
and
of
feudal
economy
as
well
as
their
relative
historical
significance
and
finally
when
emphasising
as
the
dominant
universal
tendency
of
bourgeois
economy
it
severs
completely
all
kind
of
property
from
every
kind
of
labour
the
second
round
no
more
than
the
first
between
sismondi
and

classical
school

little
glory

it
is
typical
that
on

election
to
parliament
in
when
he
already
enjoyed
the
highest
reputation

about

discussion
ricardo

death
has
been
a
profound
bereavement
not

to
his
friends
and
family

to
all

whom

brought

urbanity

thus
if
tugan

championing
views
tells
us
about
the
controversy
between
sismondi
and
ricardo
on
the
theory
and
history
of
commercial
crises
in
that
sismondi
was
compelled
acknowledge
as
correct
the
doctrine
he
had
attacked
and
to
concede
his
opponent
all
that
is
necessary
that
sismondi
himself
abandoned
his
own
theory
which
still
finds
so
many
adherents
and
that
victory
in
this
controversy
lies
with
ricardo
this
shows
a
lack
of
discrimination
to
put
it
mildly
such
as
is
practically
in
a
work
of
serious
scientific
pretensions
say
sismondi
sismondi
essay
against
ricardo
in
the
of

was
the
final
challenge
for
j
b
say
at
that
time
the
acknowledged
of
economic
science
de
la
science
the
representative
heir
and
populariser
of
the
school
of
adam
smith
on
the
continent
say
who
had
already
advanced
some
arguments
against
sismondi
in
his
letters
to
malthus
countered
the
following
july
with
an
essay
on
balance
between
consumption
and
production
in
the
to
which
sismondi
in
turn
published
a
short
reply
the
chronology
of
sismondi
polemical
engagements
was
thus
inverse
to
the
sequence
of
the
opposing
theories
for
it
had
been
say
who
first
communicated
his
doctrine
of
a
divinely
established
balance
between
production
and
consumption
to
ricardo
who
had
in
turn
handed
it
down
to
macculloch
in
fact
as
early
as
say
in
his
book
i
chapter
xii
had
coined
the
following
peremptory
statement
are
paid
for
with
other
products
it
follows
that
if
a
nation
has
too
many
goods
of
one
kind
the
means
of
selling
them
would
be
to
create
goods
of
a
different
kind
here
we
meet
again
the
all
too
familiar
conjuring
recipe
which
was
accepted
alike
by
ricardo
school
and
by
the
economists
as
the
of
the
doctrine
of
harmony
essentially
sismondi
principal
work
constitutes
a
sustained
polemic
against
this
thesis
at
this
stage
say
charges
to
the
attack
in
the
with
a
complete
as
follows
may
be
made
that
because
of
man
intelligence
because
of
the
advantage
he
can
draw
from
the
means
provided
by
nature
and
artifice
every
human
society
can
produce
the
things
fit
to
satisfy
its
needs
and
increase
its
enjoyment
in
far
larger
quantities
than
it
can
itself
consume
but
there
i
would
ask
how
it
is
possible
that
we
know
of
no
nation
that
is
supplied
with
everything
even
in
what
rank
as
prospering
nations
of
the
population
are
lacking
in
a
multitude
of
things
considered
necessities
in
i
will
not
say
a
wealthy
family
but
in
a
modest
establishment
the
village
i
live
in
at
present
lies
in
one
of
the
richest
parts
of
france
yet
in
out
of
houses
i
enter
here
i
see
but
the
coarsest
fare
and
nothing
that
makes
for
the
of
the
people
none
of
the
things
the
english
call
comforts
there
is
something
to
admire
about
the
effrontery
of
the
excellent
say
it
was
he
who
had
maintained
that
in
a
capitalist
economy
there
could
be
no
difficulties
no
surplus
no
crises
and
no
misery
since
goods
can
be
bought
one
for
the
other
we
need
only
go
on
producing
more
and
more
and
everything
in
the
garden
will
be
lovely
it
was
in
say
hands
that
this
postulate
had
become
a
tenet
of
the
doctrine
of
harmony
that
doctrine
so
typical
of
vulgar
economics
which
had
evoked
a
sharp
protest
from
sismondi
who
proved
this
view
untenable
the
latter
had
shown
that
goods
can
not
be
sold
in
any
quantity
you
like
but
that
a
limit
is
set
to
the
realisation
of
goods
by
the
income
of
society
in
each
case
by
inasmuch
as
the
wages
of
the
workers
are
depressed
to
a
mere
subsistence
level
and
inasmuch
as
there
is
also
a
natural
limit
to
the
consumptive
capacity
of
the
capitalist
class
an
expansion
of
production
sismondi
says
must
inevitably
lead
to
slumps
crises
and
ever
greater
misery
for
the
great
masses
say
to
this
is
masterly
in
its
ingenuity
if
you
will
insist
that
is
possible
how
can
it
happen
that
there
are
so
many
people
in
our
society
who
are
naked
hungry
and
in
want
pray
explain
this
contradiction
if
you
can
say
whose
own
position
excels
by
contriving
blithely
to
shrug
off
the
circulation
of
money
altogether
by
operating
with
a
system
of
barter
now
censures
his
critic
for
speaking
of
an
of
products
in
relation
not
only
to
purchasing
power
but
to
the
real
needs
of
society
and
that
although
sismondi
had
left
no
doubt
at
all
about
this
very
salient
point
of
his
deductions
if
there
is
a
very
great
number
of
badly
fed
badly
clothed
and
badly
housed
people
in
a
society
the
society
can
only
sell
what
it
buys
and
as
we
have
seen
it
can
only
buy
with
its
income
a
little
further
on
say
concedes
this
point
but
alleges
that
his
opponent
has
made
a
new
mistake
is
not
consumers
then
in
which
the
nation
is
lacking
he
says
purchasing
power
sismondi
believes
that
this
will
be
more
extensive
when
the
products
are
rare
when
consequently
they
are
dearer
and
their
production
procures
ampler
pay
for
the
workers
that
is
how
say
attempts
to
degrade
in
his
own
trite
method
of
thought
or
better
method
of
canting
sismondi
theory
which
attacked
the
very
foundations
of
capitalist
organisation
and
its
mode
of
distribution
he
burlesques
the
turning
them
into
a
plea
for
goods
and
high
prices
and
holds
up
to
them
the
mirror
of
an
artfully
flattered
capitalist
accumulation
at
its
peak
if
production
becomes
more
vigorous
he
argues
labour
grows
in
numbers
and
the
volume
of
production
expands
the
nations
will
be
better
and
more
universally
provided
for
and
he
extols
the
conditions
in
countries
where
industrial
development
is
at
its
highest
as
against
the
misery
of
the
middle
ages
sismondi
maxims
he
declares
subversive
to
capitalist
society
does
he
call
for
an
inquiry
into
the
laws
which
might
oblige
the
entrepreneur
to
guarantee
a
living
for
the

such
an
inquiry

paralyse
the

merely
the
fear
that
the
authorities
might
interfere

is
a
scourge
and
harmful
to

not

from

apologia

the

been
able
to
double
her
population
and
to
quadruple
her
consumption

he
contends
i
have
only
claimed
that
the
increase
of
products
is
a
good
if
it
is
desired
paid
for
and
consumed
that
on
the
other
hand
it
is
an
evil
if
there
being
no
demand
the
only
hope
of
the
producer
is
to
entice
the
consumers
of
a
rival
industry
products
i
have
tried
to
show
that
the
natural
course
of
the
nations
is
progressive
increase
of
their
property
an
increase
consequent
upon
their
demand
for
new
products
and
their
means
to
pay
for
them
but
that
in
consequence
of
our
institutions
of
our
legislation
having
robbed
the
working
class
of
all
property
and
every
security
they
have
also
been
spurred
to
a
disorderly
labour
quite
out
of
touch
with
the
demand
and
with
purchasing
power
which
accordingly
only
aggravates
poverty
and
he
winds
up
the
debate
by
inviting
the
preacher
of
harmony
to
reflect
upon
the
circumstance
that
though
a
nation
may
be
rich
public
misery
no
less
than
material
wealth
is
constantly
on
the
increase
the
class
which
produces
everything
being
daily
brought
nearer
to
a
position
where
it
may
consume
nothing
on
this
shrill
discordant
note
of
capitalist
contradictions
closes
the
first
clash
about
the
problem
of
accumulation
summing
up
the
general
direction
of
this
first
battle
of
wits
we
must
note
two
points
in
spite
of
all
the
confusion
in
sismondi
analysis
his
superiority
to
both
ricardo
and
his
followers
and
to
the
heir
to
the
mantle
of
adam
smith
is
quite
unmistakable
sismondi
in
taking
things
from
the
angle
of
reproduction
looks
for
concepts
of
value
capital
and
income
and
for
factual
elements
producer
and
consumer
goods
as
best
he
can
in
order
to
grasp
how
they
are
interrelated
within
the
total
social
process
in
this
he
is
nearest
to
adam
smith
with
the
difference
only
that
the
contradictions
there
appearing
as
merely
subjective
and
speculative
are
deliberately
stressed
as
the
keynote
of
sismondi
analysis
where
the
problem
of
capital
accumulation
is
treated
as
the
crucial
point
and
principal
difficulty
sismondi
has
therefore
made
obvious
advances
on
adam
smith
while
ricardo
and
his
followers
as
well
as
say
throughout
the
debate
think
solely
in
terms
of
simple
commodity
production
they
only
see
the
formula
c
m
c
even
reducing
everything
to
barter
and
believe
that
such
barren
wisdom
can
cover
all
the
problems
specific
to
the
process
of
reproduction
and
accumulation
this
is
a
regress
even
on
smith
and
over
such
myopic
vision
sismondi
scores
most
decisively
he
the
social
critic
evinces
much
more
understanding
for
the
categories
of
bourgeois
economics
than
their
staunchest
champions
just
as
at
a
later
date
the
socialist
marx
was
to
grasp
infinitely
more
keenly
than
all
bourgeois
economists
together
the
of
the
mechanism
of
capitalist
economy
if
sismondi
exclaims
in
the
face
of
doctrine
is
wealth
to
be
all
and
man
a
mere
nothing
it
is
indicative
not
only
of
the
vulnerable
moral
strain
in
his
approach
compared
to
the
stern
classical
impartiality
of
ricardo
but
also
of
a
critical
perception
sharpened
by
social
sensibilities
for
the
living
social
connections
of
economy
an
eye
that
is
for
intrinsic
contradictions
and
difficulties
as
against
the
rigid
hidebound
and
abstract
views
of
ricardo
and
his
school
the
controversy
had
only
shown
up
the
fact
that
ricardo
just
like
the
followers
of
adam
smith
was
not
even
able
to
grasp
let
alone
solve
the
puzzle
of
accumulation
put
by
sismondi
the
clue
to
the
problem
however
was
already
impossible
of
discovery
because
the
whole
argument
had
been
and
concentrated
upon
the
problem
of
crises
it
is
only
natural
that
the
outbreak
of
the
first
crisis
should
dominate
the
discussion
but
no
less
natural
that
this
effectively
prevented
either
side
from
recognising
that
crises
are
far
from
constituting
problem
of
accumulation
being
no
more
than
its
characteristic
phenomenon
one
element
in
the
cyclical
form
of
capitalist
reproduction
consequently
the
debate
could
only
result
in
a
twofold
pro
one
party
deducing
from
crises
that
accumulation
is
impossible
and
the
other
from
barter
that
crises
are
impossible
subsequent
developments
of
capitalism
were
to
give
the
lie
to
both
conclusions
alike
and
yet
sismondi
criticism
sounds
the
first
alarm
of
economic
theory
at
the
domination
of
capital
and
for
this
reason
its
historical
importance
is
both
great
and
lasting
it
paves
the
way
for
the
disintegration
of
a
classical
economics
unable
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
its
own
making
but
for
all
sismondi
terror
of
the
consequences
attendant
upon
capitalism
triumphant
he
was
certainly
no
reactionary
in
the
sense
of
yearning
for
conditions
even
if
on
occasion
he
delights
in
extolling
the
patriarchal
forms
of
production
in
agriculture
and
handicrafts
in
comparison
with
the
domination
of
capital
he
repeatedly
and
most
vigorously
protests
against
such
an
interpretation
as
in
his
polemic
against
ricardo
in
the
can
already
hear
the
outcry
that
i
jib
at
improvements
in
agriculture
and
craftsmanship
and
at
every
progress
man
could
make
that
i
doubtless
prefer
a
state
of
barbarism
to
a
state
of
civilisation
since
the
plough
is
a
tool
the
spade
an
even
older
one
and
that
according
to
my
system
man
ought
no
doubt
to
work
the
soil
with
his
bare
hands
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
and
i
crave
indulgence
to
protest
once
for
all
against
all
conclusions
imputed
to
my
system
such
as
i
myself
have
never
drawn
neither
those
who
attack
me
nor
those
who
defend
me
have
really
understood
me
and
more
than
once
i
have
been
put
to
shame
by
my
allies
as
much
as
by
my
opponents
beg
you
to
realise
that
it
is
not
the
machine
new
discoveries
and
inventions
not
civilisation
to
which
i
object
but
the
modern
organisation
of
society
an
organisation
which
despoils
the
man
who
works
of
all
property
other
than
his
arms
and
denies
him
the
least
security
in
a
reckless
that
makes
for
his
harm
and
to
which
he
is
bound
to
fall
a
prey
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
interests
of
the
proletariat
were
at
the
core
of
sismondi
criticism
and
he
is
making
no
false
claims
when
he
formulates
his
main
tendency
as
follows
am
only
working
for
means
to
secure
the
fruits
of
labour
to
those
who
do
the
work
to
make
the
machine
benefit
the
man
who
puts
it
in
motion
when
pressed
for
a
closer
definition
of
the
social
organisation
towards
which
he
aspires
it
is
true
he
hedges
and
confesses
himself
unable
to
do
so
what
remains
to
be
done
is
of
infinite
difficulty
and
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
deal
with
it
i
should
like
to
convince
the
economists
as
completely
as
i
am
convinced
myself
that
their
science
is
going
off
on
a
wrong
tack
but
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
be
able
to
show
them
the
true
course
it
is
a
supreme
effort
the
most
my
mind
will
run
to
to
form
a
conception
even
of
the
actual
organisation
of
society
yet
who
would
have
the
power
to
conceive
of
an
organisation
that
does
not
even
exist
so
far
to
see
the
future
since
we
are
already
hard
put
to
it
to
see
the
present
surely
it
was
no
disgrace
to
admit
oneself
frankly
powerless
to
envisage
a
future
beyond
capitalism
in
the
year
at
a
time
when
capitalism
had
only
just
begun
to
establish
its
domination
over
the
big
industries
and
when
the
idea
of
socialism
was
only
possible
in
a
most
utopian
form
but
as
sismondi
could
neither
advance
beyond
capitalism
nor
go
back
to
a
previous
stage
the
only
course
open
to
his
criticism
was
a
compromise
sceptical
of
the
possibility
of
developing
fully
both
capitalism
and
the
productive
forces
he
found
himself
under
necessity
to
clamour
for
some
moderation
of
accumulation
for
some
slowing
down
of
the
triumphant
march
of
capitalism
that
is
the
reactionary
aspect
of
his
criticism

über

later
on
however
in
connection
with
malthus
he
also
deals
with
sismondi
in
a
passage
that
on
the
whole
is
comprehensive
is
profoundly
aware
of
the
of
capitalist
production
he
feels
that
its
forms
its
productive
conditions
spur
on
an
untrammelled
development
of
the
productive
forces
and
of
wealth
on
the
one
hand
yet
that
these
conditions
on
the
other
are
only
relative
that
their
contradictions
of
and
of
commodity
and
money
of
sale
and
purchase
of
production
and
consumption
of
capital
and
and
so
on
take
on
ever
larger
dimensions
along
with
the
forward
strides
of
the
productive
forces
in
particular
he
feels
the
fundamental
conflict
here
the
untrammelled
development
of
productive
power
and
of
a
wealth
which
at
the
same
time
consists
in
commodities
must
be
monetised
and
there
the
basis
restriction
of
the
mass
of
producers
to
the
necessary
means
of
subsistence
he
therefore
does
not
like
ricardo
conceive
of
the
crises
as
merely
incidental
but
as
essential
as
eruptions
of
the
immanent
conflicts
on
ever
grander
scale
and
at
determinate
periods
which
faces
him
with
the
dilemma
is
the
state
to
put
restrictions
on
the
to
adapt
them
to
the
productive
conditions
or
upon
the
to
adapt
them
to
the
frequently
he
has
recourse
to
the
past
becomes
temporis
and
seeks
to
master
the
contradictions
by
a
different
regulation
of
income
relative
to
capital
or
of
distribution
relative
to
production
quite
failing
to
grasp
that
the
relations
of
distribution
are
nothing
but
the
relations
of
production
alia
he
has
a
perfect
picture
of
the
contradictions
immanent
in
bourgeois
production
yet
he
does
not
understand
them
and
therefore
fails
also
to
understand
the
process
of
their
disintegration
and
indeed
how
could
he
seeing
this
production
was
still
in
the
making
and
yet
his
view
is
in
fact
grounded
in
the
premonition
that
forms
of
appropriating
wealth
must
answer
to
the
productive
forces
developed
in
the
womb
of
capitalist
production
to
the
material
and
social
conditions
of
creating
this
wealth
that
the
bourgeois
forms
of
appropriation
are
but
transitory
and
contradictory
wealth
existing
always
with
contrary
aspects
and
presenting
itself
at
once
as
its
opposite

ever
based
on
the
premises
of
poverty

he
is
ranked
as
the
last
classic
of
bourgeois
economics
in
france
with
ricard
in
england
in
another
passage
emphasis
is
laid
on
the
fact
that
sismondi
contrary
to
ricardo
underlined
the
specifically
social
character
of
labour
that
creates
in
the
finally
sismondi
is
mentioned
as
the
head
of
the
school
malthus
at
the
same
time
as
sismondi
malthus
also
waged
war
against
some
of
the
teachings
of
ricardo
sismondi
in
the
second
edition
of
his
work
as
well
as
in
his
polemics
repeatedly
referred
to
malthus
as
an
authority
on
his
side
thus
he
formulated
the
common
aims
of
his
campaign
against
ricardo
in
the
malthus
on
the
other
hand
has
maintained
in
england
as
i
have
tried
to
do
on
the
continent
that
consumption
is
not
the
necessary
consequence
of
production
that
the
needs
and
desires
of
man
though
they
are
truly
without
limits
are
only
satisfied
by
consumption
in
so
far
as
means
of
exchange
go
with
them
we
have
affirmed
that
it
is
not
enough
to
create
these
means
of
exchange
to
make
them
circulate
among
those
who
have
these
desires
and
wants
that
it
can
even
happen
frequently
that
the
means
of
exchange
increase
in
society
together
with
a
decrease
in
the
demand
for
labour
or
wages
so
that
the
desires
and
wants
of
one
part
of
the
population
can
not
be
satisfied
and
consumption
also
decreases
finally
we
have
claimed
that
the
unmistakable
sign
of
prosperity
in
a
society
is
not
an
increasing
production
of
wealth
but
an
increasing
demand
for
labour
or
the
offer
of
more
and
more
wages
in
compensation
for
this
labour
ricardo
and
say
though
not
denying
that
an
increasing
demand
for
labour
is
a
symptom
of
prosperity
maintained
that
it
inevitably
results
from
an
increase
of
production
as
for
malthus
and
myself
we
regard
these
two
increases
as
resulting
from
independent
causes
which
may
at
times
even
be
in
opposition
according
to
our
view
if
the
demand
for
labour
has
not
preceded
and
determined
production
the
market
will
be
flooded
and
then
new
production
becomes
a
cause
of
ruin
not
of
enjoyment
these
remarks
suggest
agreement
a
brotherhood
in
arms
of
sismondi
and
malthus
at
least
in
their
opposition
against
ricardo
and
his
school
marx
considers
the
of
political
which
malthus
published
in
an
outright
plagiarism
of
the
which
had
been
published
the
year
before
yet
sismondi
and
malthus
are
frequently
at
odds
regarding
the
problem
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
sismondi
is
critical
of
capitalist
production
he
attacks
it
sharply
even
denounces
it
while
malthus
stands
for
the
defence
this
does
not
mean
that
he
denies
its
inherent
contradictions
as
say
or
macculloch
had
done
on
the
contrary
he
raises
them
quite
unmercifully
to
the
status
of
a
natural
law
and
asserts
their
absolute
sanctity
guiding
principle
is
the
interests
of
the
workers
he
aspires
though
rather
generally
and
vaguely
towards
a
thoroughgoing
reform
of
distribution
in
favour
of
the
proletariat
malthus
provides
the
ideology
for
those
strata
who
are
the
parasites
of
capitalist
exploitation
who
live
on
ground
rent
and
draw
upon
the
common
wealth
and
advocates
the
allocation
of
the
greatest
possible
portion
of
the
surplus
value
to
these
consumers
sismondi
general
approach
is
predominantly
ethical
it
is
the
approach
of
the
social
reformer
improving
upon
the
classics
he
stresses
in
opposition
to
them
that
is
the
only
end
of
accumulation
and
pleads
for
restricted
accumulation
malthus
on
the
contrary
bluntly
declares
that
production
has
no
other
purpose
than
accumulation
and
advocates
unlimited
accumulation
by
the
capitalists
to
be
supplemented
and
assured
by
the
unlimited
consumption
of
their
parasites
finally
sismondi
starts
off
with
a
critical
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
of
the
relation
between
capital
and
income
from
the
point
of
view
of
society
while
malthus
opposing
ricardo
begins
with
an
absurd
theory
of
value
from
which
he
derives
an
equally
absurd
theory
of
surplus
value
attempting
to
explain
capitalist
profits
as
an
addition
to
the
price
over
and
above
the
value
of
commodities
malthus
opposes
the
postulate
that
supply
and
demand
are
identical
with
a
detailed
critique
in
chapter
vi
of
his
in
political
in
his
of
political
james
mill
had
declared
is
it
that
is
necessarily
meant
when
we
say
that
the
supply
and
the
demand
are
accommodated
to
one
another
it
is
this
that
goods
which
have
been
produced
by
a
certain
quantity
of
labour
exchange
for
goods
which
have
been
produced
by
an
equal
quantity
of
labour
let
this
proposition
be
duly
attended
to
and
all
the
rest
is
thus
if
a
pair
of
shoes
is
produced
with
an
equal
quantity
of
labour
as
a
hat
so
long
as
a
hat
exchanges
for
a
pair
of
shoes
so
long
the
supply
and
demand
are
accommodated
to
one
another
if
it
should
so
happen
that
shoes
fell
in
value
as
compared
with
hats
which
is
the
same
thing
as
hats
rising
in
value
compared
with
shoes
this
would
simply
imply
that
more
shoes
had
been
brought
to
market
as
compared
with
hats
shoes
would
then
be
in
more
than
the
due
abundance
why
because
in
them
the
produce
of
a
certain
quantity
of
labour
would
not
exchange
for
the
produce
of
an
equal
quantity
but
for
the
very
same
reason
hats
would
be
in
less
than
the
due
abundance
because
the
produce
of
a
certain
quantity
of
labour
in
them
would
exchange
for
the
produce
of
more
than
an
equal
quantity
in
shoes
against
such
trite
tautologies
malthus
marshals
a
twofold
argument
he
first
draws
mill
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
is
building
without
solid
foundations
in
fact
he
argues
even
without
an
alteration
in
the
ratio
of
exchange
between
hats
and
shoes
there
may
yet
be
too
great
a
quantity
of
in
relation
to
the
demand
this
will
result
in
both
being
sold
at
less
than
the
cost
of
production
plus
an
appropriate
profit
can
it
be
said
on
this
account
he
asks
the
supply
of
hats
is
suited
to
the
demand
for
hats
or
the
supply
of
shoes
suited
to
the
demand
for
shoes
when
they
are
both
so
abundant
that
neither
of
them
will
exchange
for
what
will
fulfil
the
conditions
of
their
continued
supply
in
other
words
malthus
confronts
mill
with
the
possibility
of
general
when
they
are
compared
with
the
costs
of
production
it
is
evident
that
they
may
all
fall
or
rise
at
the
same
time
secondly
he
protests
against
the
way
in
which
mill
ricardo
and
company
are
wont
to
model
their
postulates
on
a
system
of
barter
hop
planter
who
takes
a
hundred
bags
of
hops
to
weyhill
fair
thinks
little
more
about
the
supply
of
hats
and
shoes
than
he
does
about
the
spots
in
the
sun
what
does
he
think
about
then
and
what
does
he
want
to
exchange
his
hops
for
mill
seems
to
be
of
opinion
that
it
would
show
great
ignorance
of
political
economy
to
say
that
what
he
wants
is
money
yet
notwithstanding
the
probable
imputation
of
this
great
ignorance
i
have
no
hesitation
in
distinctly
asserting
that
it
really
is
money
which
he
wants
for
the
rest
malthus
is
content
to
describe
the
machinery
by
which
an
excessive
supply
can
depress
prices
below
the
cost
of
production
and
so
automatically
bring
about
a
restriction
of
production
and
this
tendency
in
the
natural
course
of
things
to
cure
a
glut
or
a
scarcity
is
no
proof
that
such
evils
have
never
existed
it
is
clear
that
in
spite
of
his
contrary
views
on
the
question
of
crises
malthus
thinks
along
the
same
lines
as
ricardo
mill
say
and
macculloch
for
him
too
everything
can
be
reduced
to
barter
the
social
reproductive
process
with
its
large
categories
and
interrelations
which
claimed
the
whole
of
sismondi
attention
is
here
completely
ignored
in
view
of
so
many
contradictions
within
the
fundamental
approach
the
criticism
of
sismondi
and
malthus
have
only
a
few
points
in
common
contrary
to
say
and
the
followers
of
ricardo
they
both
deny
the
hypothesis
of
a
balance
of
consumption
and
production
they
both
maintain
that
not
only
partial
but
also
universal
crises
are
possible
but
here
their
agreement
ends
if
sismondi
seeks
the
cause
of
crises
in
the
low
level
of
wages
and
the
capitalists
limited
capacity
for
consumption
malthus
on
the
other
hand
transforms
the
fact
of
low
wages
into
a
natural
law
of
population
movements
for
the
limited
capacity
for
consumption
however
he
finds
a
substitute
in
the
consumption
of
the
parasites
on
surplus
value
such
as
the
landed
gentry
and
the
clergy
with
their
unlimited
capacity
for
wealth
and
luxury
church
with
a
capacious
maw
is
blest
both
malthus
and
sismondi
look
for
a
category
of
consumers
who
buy
without
selling
in
order
to
redeem
capitalist
accumulation
and
save
it
from
a
precarious
position
but
sismondi
needs
them
to
get
rid
of
the
surplus
product
of
society
over
and
above
the
consumption
of
the
workers
and
capitalists
that
is
to
say
to
get
rid
of
the
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
malthus
wants
them
as
of
profit
in
general
it
remains
entirely
his
secret
of
course
how
the
and
the
incumbents
of
the
state
can
assist
the
capitalists
in
appropriating
their
profits
by
buying
commodities
at
an
increased
price
since
they
themselves
obtain
their
purchasing
power
mainly
from
these
capitalists
in
view
of
these
profound
contrasts
the
alliance
between
malthus
and
sismondi
does
not
go
very
deep
and
if
malthus
as
marx
has
it
distorts
sismondi
into
a
malthusian
caricature
sismondi
in
turn
stresses
only
what
is
common
to
them
both
and
quotes
malthus
in
support
giving
the
latter
critique
of
ricardo
a
somewhat
sismondian
cast
on
occasion
no
doubt
sismondi
actually
succumbs
to
the
influence
of
malthus
for
instance
he
takes
over
the
latter
theory
of
reckless
state
expenditure
as
an
emergency
measure
in
aid
of
accumulation
and
so
becomes
involved
in
contradictions
with
his
own
initial
assumptions
on
the
whole
malthus
neither
rendered
an
original
contribution
to
the
problem
of
reproduction
nor
even
grasped
it
fully
in
his
controversy
with
the
followers
of
ricardo
he
operated
with
the
concepts
of
simple
commodity
circulation
just
as
they
did
in
their
controversy
with
sismondi
his
quarrel
with
that
school
turns
on
the
consumption
by
the
parasites
of
the
surplus
value
it
is
not
a
quarrel
about
the
social
foundations
of
capitalist
reproduction
edifice
tumbles
to
the
ground
as
soon
as
the
absurd
mistakes
in
his
theory
of
profits
are
uncovered
sismondi
criticism
remains
valid
and
his
problems
remain
unsolved
even
if
we
accept
ricardo
theory
of
value
with
all
its
consequences

had
stimulated

against

it
was
the

movement
arisen
since
which
almost
years
later
provided
the
incentive
for
rodbertus
critique
of
capitalist
production
the
risings
of
the
lyons
silk
weavers
and
the
chartist
movement
in
england
were
vastly
different
from
the
shadowy
spectres
raised
by
the

and
the
ears
of
the
bourgeoisie
were
made
to
ring
with
their
criticism
of
the
most
wonderful
of
all
forms
of
society
the

work

probably
written
for

do

want
will
the
others
be
able
to
keep
it
from
them
will
what
they
want
be
the
grave
of
modern
civilisation
thoughtful
people
have
long
realised
that
a
time
must
come
when
history
would
put
this
question
with
great
urgency
now
the
man
in
the
street
has
learned
it
too
from
the
chartist
meetings
and
the
birmingham
scenes
during
the
forties
the
leaven
of
revolutionary
ideas
was
most
vigorously
at
work
in
france
in
the
formation
of
the
various
secret
societies
and
socialist
schools
of
the
followers
of
proudhon
blanqui
cabet
louis
blanc
etc
the
february
revolution
and
the
june
proclamation
of
the
to
work
led
to
a
first
clash
between
the
two
worlds
of
capitalist
society
an
eruption
of
the
contradictions
latent
in
capitalism
as
regards
the
other
visible
form
of
those
contradictions
the
crises
the
available
data
for
observation
at
the
time
of
the
second
controversy
were
far
more
comprehensive
than
in
the
early
twenties
of
the
century
the
dispute
between
rodbertus
and
kirchmann
took
place
under
the
immediate
impact
of
the
crises
in
and
even
of
the
first
world
crisis
in
rodbertus
writing
his
interesting
pamphlet
commercial
crises
and
the
mortgage
problem
of
the
in
thus
the
inherent
contradictions
of
capitalist
society
meeting
his
eyes
were
in
strident
discord
with
the
doctrine
of
harmony
held
by
the
english
classics
and
their
vulgarisers
both
in
england
and
on
the
continent
quite
unlike
any
critique
in
the
times
when
sismondi
had
raised
his
voice
in
warning
incidentally
a
quotation
from
sismondi
in
rodbertus
first
writing
proves
that
the
former
strictures
immediately
influenced
rodbertus
he
was
thus
familiar
with
contemporary
french
writings
against
the
classical
school
though
perhaps
less
so
with
the
far
more
numerous
english
literature
there
is
no
more
than
this
flimsy
support
for
the
myth
of
the
german
professors
about
the
of
rodbertus
over
marx
in
the
of
socialism
accordingly
professor
diehl
writes
in
his
article
on
rodbertus
in
der
must
be
considered
the
real
founder
of
scientific
socialism
in
germany
since
in
his
writings
between
and
even
before
marx
and
lassalle
he
provided
a
comprehensive
socialist
system
a
critique
of
adam
smith
doctrine
new
theoretical
foundations
and
proposals
for
social
reform
this
piece
of
pious
righteousness
comes
from
the
second
edition
of
after
all
that
had
been
written
by
engels
kautsky
and
mehring
to
destroy
this
learned
legend
and
in
spite
of
it
quite
inevitably
of
course
and
proof
against
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
however
weighty
it
was
only
right
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
learned
german
economists
that
the
palm
of
should
be
wrested
from
marx
the
revolutionary
anarchist
by
rodbertus
the
with
monarchist
prussian
and
nationalist
leanings
the
man
who
believed
in
communism
five
hundred
years
from
now
but
for
the
present
supported
a
steady
exploitation
rate
of
per
cent
however
we
are
interested
in
another
aspect
of
rodbertus
analysis
the
same
professor
diehl
continues
his
eulogy
as
follows
was
not
only
a
pioneer
of
socialism
political
economy
as
a
whole
owes
much
stimulation
and
furtherance
to
him
economic
theory
in
particular
is
indebted
to
him
for
the
critique
of
classical
economics
for
the
new
theory
of
the
distribution
of
income
for
the
distinction
between
the
logical
and
historical
categories
of
capital
and
so
on
here
we
shall
deal
with
these
latter
achievements
of
rodbertus
especially
with
the
so
on
rodbertus
decisive
treatise
the
understanding
of
our
of
set
the
ball
rolling
kirchmann
replied
in
with
two
essays
the
social
aspects
of
ground
and
society
of
and
rodbertus
parried
in
with
his
on
social
thus
the
discussion
entered
the
same
theoretical
arena
where
and
had
fought
out
their
differences
thirty
years
earlier
in
his
earliest
writings
rodbertus
had
already
expressed
the
thought
that
the
wages
of
labour
present
an
ever
diminishing
part
of
the
national
product
in
modern
society
where
the
productivity
of
labour
is
increasing
he
claimed
this
to
be
an
original
idea
and
from
that
moment
until
his
death
thirty
years
later
he
did
nothing
but
reiterate
it
and
formulate
it
in
various
ways
this
wage
rate
is
for
him
the
root
of
all
evils
to
be
found
in
modern
society
in
particular
of
pauperism
and
the
crises
whose
combination
he
calls
social
problem
of
our
times
kirchmann
does
not
agree
with
this
explanation
he
traces
pauperism
back
to
the
effects
of
a
rising
ground
rent
crises
on
the
other
hand
to
a
lack
of
markets
about
the
latter
especially
he
says
greatest
part
of
social
ills
is
caused
not
by
defects
of
production
but
by
a
lack
of
markets
for
the
products
the
more
a
country
can
produce
the
more
means
it
has
for
satisfying
every
need
the
more
it
is
exposed
to
the
danger
of
misery
and
want
the
is
here
included
as
well
for
notorious
right
to
work
ultimately
reduces
to
the
question
of
markets
see
he
concludes
the
social
problem
is
almost
identical
with
the
problem
of
markets
even
the
ills
of
competition
will
vanish
once
markets
are
secure
its
advantages
alone
will
remain
there
will
remain
a
spirit
of
rivalry
to
supply
good
and
cheap
commodities
but
the
struggle
will
disappear
which
is
caused
only
by
insufficient
markets
the
difference
between
the
points
of
view
of
rodbertus
and
kirchmann
is
evident
rodbertus
sees
the
root
of
the
evil
in
a
faulty
distribution
of
the
national
product
and
kirchmann
in
the
limitations
of
the
markets
for
capitalist
production
notwithstanding
all
the
confusion
in
his
expositions
especially
in
his
idealist
vision
of
a
capitalist
competition
content
with
a
laudable
rivalry
for
better
and
cheaper
commodities
and
also
in
his
conception
of
the
right
to
as
a
problem
of
markets
kirchmann
up
to
a
point
still
shows
more
understanding
for
the
sore
spot
of
capitalist
production
the
limitations
of
its
market
than
rodbertus
who
clings
to
distribution
thus
it
is
kirchmann
who
now
takes
up
the
problem
which
sismondi
had
originally
put
on
the
agenda
nevertheless
he
by
no
means
agrees
with
sismondi
elucidation
and
solution
of
the
problem
siding
rather
with
the
opponents
of
the
latter
not
only
does
he
accept
ricardo
theory
of
ground
rent
and
adam
smith
dogma
that
price
of
the
commodity
is
composed
of
two
parts
only
of
the
interests
on
capital
and
the
wages
of
labour
kirchmann
transforms
the
surplus
value
into
on
capital
he
also
subscribes
to
the
thesis
of
say
and
ricardo
that
products
are
only
bought
with
other
products
and
that
production
creates
its
own
demand
so
that
if
one
side
appears
to
have
produced
too
much
it
only
means
there
was
not
enough
production
on
the
other
kirchmann
we
see
faithfully
follows
the
classics
if
in
a
somewhat
edition
he
begins
by
arguing
that
say
law
of
a
natural
balance
between
production
and
demand
does
not
give
a
comprehensive
picture
of
reality
and
adds
involves
yet
further
hidden
laws
which
prevent
this
postulated
order
from
obtaining
in
complete
purity
they
must
be
discovered
if
we
are
to
explain
the
present
flooding
of
the
market
and
their
discovery
might
perhaps
also
show
us
the
way
to
avoid
this
great
evil
we
believe
that
there
are
three
relations
in
the
modern
system
of
society
which
cause
these
conflicts
between
say
indubitable
law
and
reality
these
relations
are
inequitable
a
distribution
of
the
products
here
as
we
see
kirchmann
somewhat
approximates
to
sismondi
point
of
view
the
difficulties
which
nature
puts
in
the
way
of
human
labour
engaged
in
production
and
finally
the
defects
of
commerce
as
a
mediator
between
production
and
consumption
disregarding
the
last
two
obstacles
to
say
law
we
shall
now
consider
kirchmann
reasoning
of
his
first
point
first
relation
he
explains
be
put
more
briefly
as
too
low
a
wage
of
labour
which
is
thus
the
cause
of
a
slump
those
who
know
that
the
price
of
commodities
is
composed
of
two
parts
only
of
the
interest
on
capital
and
the
wage
of
labour
might
consider
this
a
startling
statement
if
the
wage
of
labour
is
low
prices
are
low
as
well
and
if
one
is
high
so
is
the
other
we
see
kirchmann
accepts
smith
dogma
even
in
its
most
misleading
form
the
price
is
not
into
wage
of
labour
and
surplus
value
but
is
of
them
as
a
mere
sum
a
view
in
which
adam
smith
strayed
furthest
from
his
own
theory
of
the
value
of
labour
and
price
thus
are
directly
related
they
balance
each
other
england
only
abolished
her
corn
laws
her
tariffs
on
meat
and
other
victuals
in
order
to
cause
wages
to
fall
and
thus
to
enable
her
manufacturers
to
oust
all
other
competitors
from
the
world
markets
by
means
of
still
cheaper
commodities
this
however
only
holds
good
up
to
a
point
and
does
not
affect
the
ratio
in
which
the
product
is
distributed
among
the
workers
and
the
capitalists
too
inequitable
a
distribution
among
these
two
is
the
primary
and
most
important
cause
why
say
law
is
not
fulfilled
in
real
life
why
the
markets
are
flooded
although
there
is
production
in
all
branches
kirchmann
gives
a
detailed
illustration
of
this
statement
using
the
classical
method
he
takes
us
of
course
to
an
imaginary
isolated
society
which
makes
an
unresisting
if
thankless
object
for
the
experiments
of
political
economy
kirchmann
suggests
we
should
imagine
a
place
which
comprises
inhabitants
no
more
no
less
three
entrepreneurs
with
workers
each
is
to
be
able
to
satisfy
all
needs
by
its
own
production
in
three
establishments
that
is
to
say
one
for
clothing
a
second
for
food
lighting
fuel
and
raw
materials
and
a
third
for
housing
furniture
and
tools
in
each
of
these
three
departments
the
together
with
the
raw
materials
is
to
be
provided
by
the
entrepreneur
and
the
remuneration
of
the
workers
is
to
be
so
arranged
that
the
workers
obtain
as
their
wage
one
half
of
the
annual
produce
the
entrepreneur
retaining
the
other
half
interest
on
capital
and
profits
of
the
enterprise
every
business
is
to
produce
just
enough
to
satisfy
all
the
needs
of
the
inhabitants
accordingly
has
the
conditions
necessary
for
general
and
everybody
can
therefore
tackle
his
work
with
courage
and
vigour
after
a
few
days
however
joy
and
delight
turn
into
a
universal
misery
and
gnashing
of
teeth
something
has
happened
on
kirchmann
island
of
the
blessed
which
was
no
more
to
be
expected
than
for
the
skies
to
fall
an
industrial
and
commercial
crisis
according
to
all
modern
specifications
has
broken
out
only
the
most
essential
clothing
food
and
housing
for
the
workers
has
been
produced
yet
the
warehouses
of
the
three
entrepreneurs
are
full
of
clothes
and
raw
materials
and
their
houses
stand
empty
they
complain
of
a
lack
of
demand
while
the
workers
in
turn
complain
that
their
wants
are
not
fully
satisfied
what
has
gone
wrong
could
it
be
that
there
is
too
much
of
one
kind
of
produce
and
too
little
of
another
as
say
and
ricardo
would
have
it
not
at
all
answers
kirchmann
everything
available
in
in
quantities
just
enough
to
satisfy
all
the
wants
of
the
community
what
then
has
thrown
a
spanner
into
the
works
why
the
crisis
the
obstruction
caused
by
distribution
alone
but
this
must
be
savoured
in
kirchmann
own
words
obstacle
why
nevertheless
no
smooth
exchange
takes
place
lies
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
distribution
of
these
products
they
are
not
distributed
equitably
among
all
but
the
entrepreneurs
retain
half
of
them
for
themselves
as
interest
and
profit
and
only
give
half
to
the
workers
it
is
clear
that
the
worker
in
the
clothing
department
can
exchange
against
half
of
his
product
only
half
of
the
food
lodging
that
has
been
produced
and
it
is
clear
that
the
entrepreneur
can
not
get
rid
of
the
other
half
since
no
worker
has
any
more
products
to
give
in
exchange
the
entrepreneurs
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
their
stocks
the
workers
do
not
know
what
to
do
for
hunger
and
nakedness
nor
does
the
reader
we
might
add
know
what
to
do
with
constructions
his
model
is
so
childish
that
every
advance
leads
deeper
into
the
maze
first
of
all
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
whatever
why
and
to
what
purpose
kirchmann
should
devise
this
of
production
into
three
parts
if
analogous
examples
by
ricardo
and
macculloch
usually
confront
tenant
farmers
and
manufacturers
that
is
presumably
only
inspired
by
the
antiquated
physiocrat
conception
of
social
reproduction
which
ricardo
had
adopted
although
his
own
theory
of
value
as
against
the
physiocrats
deprived
it
of
all
meaning
and
although
adam
smith
had
already
made
a
good
start
in
considering
the
real
material
foundations
of
the
social
reproductive
process
still
we
have
seen
that
the
tradition
of
distinguishing
between
agriculture
and
industry
as
the
foundation
of
reproduction
was
kept
up
in
economic
theory
until
marx
introduced
his
distinction
of
the
two
productive
departments
in
society
for
producer
and
consumer
goods
three
departments
however
have
no
real
significance
at
all
obviously
no
material
consideration
of
reproduction
can
have
been
responsible
for
this
supremely
arbitrary
division
which
jumbles
up
tools
and
furniture
raw
materials
and
food
but
makes
clothing
a
department
in
its
own
right
one
might
as
well
postulate
one
department
for
food
clothing
and
housing
another
for
medicines
and
a
third
for
tooth
brushes
kirchmann
primary
concern
no
doubt
is
with
the
social
division
of
labour
hence
the
assumption
of
as
nearly
equal
quantities
of
products
as
possible
in
the
transactions
of
exchange
yet
this
exchange
on
which
the
argument
turns
plays
no
part
at
all
in
kirchmann
example
since
it
is
not
the
value
which
is
distributed
but
the
quantities
of
products
the
bulk
of
as
such
in
this
intriguing
of
kirchmann
imagining
again
the
products
are
distributed
first
and
only
afterwards
when
the
distribution
is
accomplished
is
there
to
be
universal
exchange
whereas
on
the
solid
ground
of
capitalist
production
it
is
as
we
know
the
exchange
which
inaugurates
the
distribution
of
the
product
and
serves
as
its
agent
besides
the
queerest
things
happen
in
kirchmann
distributive
system
we
all
know
the
prices
of
the
products
the
price
of
the
aggregate
product
of
society
consist
of
of
wage
and
capital
interest
alone
so
that
the
aggregate
product
must
be
distributed
entirely
among
workers
and
entrepreneurs
but
then
unhappily
kirchmann
dimly
remembers
the
fact
that
production
needs
things
like
raw
materials
and
tools
so
is
provided
with
raw
materials
furtively
introduced
among
the
food
and
with
tools
among
the
furniture
but
now
the
question
arises
who
is
to
get
these
indigestible
items
in
the
course
of
general
distribution
the
workers
as
wages
or
the
capitalists
as
profits
of
enterprise
they
could
hardly
expect
a
warm
welcome
from
either
and
on
such
feeble
premises
the
star
turn
of
the
performance
is
to
take
place
the
exchange
between
workers
and
entrepreneurs
the
fundamental
transaction
of
exchange
in
capitalist
production
the
exchange
between
workers
and
capitalists
is
transformed
by
kirchmann
from
an
exchange
between
living
labour
and
capital
into
an
exchange
of
products
not
the
first
act
that
of
exchanging
labour
power
for
variable
capital
but
the
second
the
realisation
of
the
wage
received
from
the
variable
capital
is
put
at
the
centre
of
the
whole
machinery
the
entire
commodity
exchange
of
capitalist
society
being
in
turn
reduced
to
this
realisation
of
the
and
the
crowning
glory
is
that
this
exchange
between
workers
and
entrepreneurs
the
of
all
economic
life
dissolves
into
nothing
on
a
closer
scrutiny
it
does
not
take
place
at
all
for
as
soon
as
all
workers
have
received
their
natural
wages
in
the
form
of
half
their
product
an
exchange
will
be
possible
only
among
the
workers
themselves
every
worker
will
only
keep
of
his
wage
consisting
exclusively
of
either
clothing
food
or
furniture
as
the
case
may
be
and
realise
the
remainder
to
equal
parts
in
the
two
other
the
entrepreneurs
no
longer
come
into
this
at
all
the
three
of
them
are
left
high
and
dry
with
their
surplus
value
half
the
clothing
furniture
and
food
that
has
been
produced
by
the
society
and
they
have
no
idea
what
to
do
with
the
stuff
in
this
calamity
of
kirchmann
creation
even
the
most
generous
distribution
of
the
product
would
be
of
no
use
on
the
contrary
if
larger
quantities
of
the
social
product
were
allotted
to
the
workers
they
would
have
even
less
to
do
with
the
entrepreneurs
in
this
transaction
all
that
would
happen
is
that
the
exchange
of
the
workers
among
themselves
would
increase
in
volume
the
surplus
product
which
the
entrepreneurs
have
on
their
hands
would
then
contract
it
is
true
though
not
indeed
because
the
exchange
of
the
surplus
product
would
be
facilitated
but
merely
because
there
would
be
less
surplus
value
altogether
now
as
before
an
exchange
of
the
social
product
between
workers
and
entrepreneurs
is
out
of
the
question
one
must
confess
that
the
puerile
and
absurd
economics
here
crammed
into
comparatively
little
space
exceed
the
bounds
even
of
what
might
be
put
up
with
from
a
prussian
public
prosecutor
such
having
been
kirchmann
profession
though
he
must
be
credited
with
having
incurred
disciplinary
censure
on
two
occasions
nevertheless
after
these
unpromising
preliminaries
kirchmann
goes
right
to
the
root
of
the
matter
he
admits
that
his
assuming
the
surplus
product
in
a
concrete
is
the
reason
why
the
surplus
value
can
not
be
usefully
employed
as
a
remedy
he
now
allows
the
entrepreneurs
to
devote
half
of
the
social
labour
appropriated
as
surplus
value
to
the
production
not
of
common
goods
but
of
luxuries
the
of
being
that
they
enable
the
consumer
to
use
up
more
capital
and
labour
power
than
in
the
case
of
ordinary
goods
the
three
entrepreneurs
manage
to
consume
by
themselves
in
the
form
of
laces
fashionable
carriages
and
the
like
their
entire
in
all
the
labour
performed
by
the
society
now
nothing
unsaleable
is
left
and
the
crisis
is
happily
avoided
is
made
impossible
once
and
for
all
capitalists
and
workers
alike
are
safe
the
name
of
kirchmann
magic
cure
which
has
brought
all
these
benefits
to
pass
and
which
the
balance
between
production
and
consumption
being
luxury
in
other
words
the
capitalists
who
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
their
surplus
value
which
they
can
not
realise
are
advised
by
the
dear
fellow
to
eat
it
up
as
it
happens
luxury
is
in
fact
an
old
familiar
invention
of
capitalist
society
and
still
there
are
recurrent
crises
why
is
this
kirchmann
enlightens
us
answer
can
only
be
that
in
real
life
sluggish
markets
are
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
there
are
still
luxuries
or
in
other
words
that
the
capitalists
those
who
can
afford
to
consume
still
consume
too
little
this
misguided
abstinence
of
the
capitalists
however
results
from
a
bad
habit
which
political
economists
have
been
to
encourage
the
desire
to
save
for
purposes
of
consumption
in
other
words
crises
are
caused
by
accumulation
this
is
kirchmann
principal
thesis
he
proves
it
again
by
means
of
a
touchingly
simple
example
us
assume
conditions
which
economists
praise
as
more
favourable
he
says
the
entrepreneurs
say
we
do
not
want
to
spend
our
income
to
the
last
penny
in
splendour
and
luxury
but
will
it
productively
what
does
this
mean
nothing
but
the
of
all
sorts
of
productive
enterprises
for
delivering
new
goods
of
such
a
kind
that
their
sale
can
yield
interest
kirchmann
means
profits
on
a
capital
saved
and
invested
by
the
three
entrepreneurs
from
their
unconsumed
revenues
accordingly
the
three
entrepreneurs
decide
to
consume
only
the
produce
of
a
hundred
workers
that
is
to
say
to
restrict
their
luxury
considerably
and
to
employ
the
labour
power
of
the
remaining
workers
together
with
the
capital
they
use
for
setting
up
new
productive
enterprises
the
question
now
arises
in
what
kind
of
productive
enterprises
these
funds
are
to
be
used
since
according
to
kirchmann
assumption
constant
capital
is
not
reproduced
and
the
entire
social
product
consists
entirely
of
consumer
goods
three
entrepreneurs
can
only
choose
again
between
enterprises
for
the
manufacture
of
ordinary
goods
or
for
that
of
luxuries
in
this
way
however
the
three
entrepreneurs
will
be
faced
with
the
already
familiar
dilemma
if
they
turn
out
goods
there
will
be
a
crisis
since
the
workers
lack
means
to
purchase
these
additional
provisions
having
been
bought
off
with
half
the
value
of
their
produce
if
they
go
in
for
luxuries
they
will
have
to
consume
them
alone
there
is
no
other
possibility
the
dilemma
is
not
even
affected
by
foreign
trade
which
would
increase
the
range
of
commodities
on
the
home
market
or
increase
productivity
foreign
commodities
are
therefore
either
common
goods
then
the
capitalist
will
not
and
the
worker
lacking
the
means
can
not
buy
them
or
they
are
luxuries
in
which
case
the
worker
of
course
is
even
less
able
to
buy
them
and
the
capitalist
will
not
want
them
either
because
of
his
efforts
to
save
this
argument
however
primitive
yet
shows
quite
nicely
and
clearly
the
fundamental
conception
of
kirchmann
and
the
nightmare
of
all
economic
theory
in
a
society
consisting
exclusively
of
workers
and
capitalists
accumulation
will
be
impossible
kirchmann
is
therefore
frankly
hostile
to
accumulation
consumption
of
the
surplus
value
and
strongly
attacks
these
errors
advocated
by
classical
economics
his
gospel
is
increasing
luxury
together
with
the
productivity
of
labour
as
the
specific
against
crises
we
see
that
kirchmann
if
he
grotesquely
aped
ricardo
and
say
in
his
theoretical
assumptions
is
a
caricature
of
sismondi
in
his
final
conclusions
yet
it
is
imperative
to
get
kirchmann
approach
to
the
problem
perfectly
clear
if
we
are
to
understand
the
import
of
rodbertus
criticism
and
the
outcome
of
the
whole
controversy

rodbertus
digs
deeper
than
kirchmann
he
looks
for
the
roots

in
the
very
foundations
of
social
organisation
and
declares
bitter
war
on
the
predominant
free
trade
school
not
against
a
system
of
unrestricted
commodity
circulation
or
the
freedom
of
trade
which
he
fully
accepts
but
against
the
manchester
doctrine
of
within
the
internal
social
relations
of
economy
at
that
time
after
the
period
of
storm
and
stress
of
classical
economics
a
system
of
unscrupulous
apologetics
was
already
in
full
sway
which
found
its
most
perfect
expression
in
the
of
harmony
of
frédéric
bastiat
the
famous
vulgarian
and
idol
of

philistines
and
quite
soon
the
various

were
to
flourish
as
commonplace
german
imitations
of

rodbertus
strictures
are
aimed
at
these
unscrupulous
of
free

in
his
first

social
he
exclaims
of
their
paltry
incomes

but
are
in

they
sometimes
succumb
yet
they
are
the
creators
of
all
the
wealth
of
the
society
their
labours
begin
at
dawn
and
end
at
dusk
continuing
even
after
night
has
fallen
but
no
exertion
can
change
this
fate
they
can
not
raise
their
income
and
only
lose
that
little
leisure
which
ought
to
remain
nowadays
for
the
improvement
of
their
minds
hitherto
it
might
have
seemed
as
if
all
this
suffering
were
necessary
to
the
progress
of
civilisation
but
now
that
a
series
of
the
most
wonderful
discoveries
and
inventions
have
increased
human
labour
power
more
than
a
hundredfold
new
prospects
of
changing
these
grim
conditions
are
suddenly
revealed
as
a
result
the
wealth
and
assets
of
a
nation
increase
at
a
growing
rate
as
compared
with
the
population
could
anything
be
more
natural
i
ask
or
more
justly
demanded
than
that
this
increase
should
also
somehow
benefit
the
creators
of
this
old
and
new
wealth
that
their
incomes
should
be
raised
or
their
shortened
or
that
they
might
join
in
increasing
numbers
the
ranks
of
the
lucky
ones
privileged
to
reap
the
fruits
of
labour
yet
state
economy
or
better
national
economy
has
only
achieved
the
opposite
result
increasing
poverty
of
these
classes
goes
together
with
increasing
wealth
of
the
nation
there
is
even
need
of
special
legislation
lest
the
working
day
become
longer
and
finally
the
working
classes
swell
in
number
out
of
proportion
with
the
others
even
that
is
not
enough
the
hundredfold
increase
of
labour
efficiency
which
was
powerless
to
relieve
of
the
population
even
threatens
periodically
the
remaining
sixth
of
the
nation
and
thus
society
as
a
whole
contradictions
in
the
economic
sphere
in
particular
and
what
contradictions
in
the
social
sphere
in
general
the
wealth
of
society
is
growing
and
this
growth
is
accompanied
by
a
growth
of
the
creative
efficiency
of
the
means
of
production
is
increasing
and
the
consequence
is
that
they
are
scrapped
social
conditions
demand
that
the
material
position
of
the
working
classes
should
be
raised
to
the
level
of
their
political
status
and
economic
conditions
by
way
of
answer
depress
them
further
society
needs
the
unrestricted
growth
of
wealth
and
contemporary
leaders
of
production
must
create
restrictions
in
order
to
discourage
poverty
in
a
single
respect
alone
is
there
harmony
just
as
wrong
as
the
conditions
is
the
authoritative
section
of
the
society
with
its
inclination
to
look
for
the
root
of
the
evil
everywhere
except
in
the
right
place
this
egotism
which
only
too
often
dons
the
scholar
gown
also
accuses
the
vices
of
the
workers
of
being
the
cause
of
poverty
the
responsibility
for
the
crimes
committed
against
them
by
facts
is
ascribed
to
their
alleged
discontent
and
shiftlessness
and
where
even
such
egotism
can
not
close
its
eyes
to
their
innocence
it
makes
an
elaborate
dogma
of
the
necessity
of
poverty
unremittingly
it
exhorts
the
workers
only
to
work
and
to
pray
impresses
upon
them
the
duty
of
abstinence
and
economy
and
at
best
infringes
upon
their
rights
by
the
institution
of
compulsory
saving
adding
to
the
misery
of
the
workers
it
does
not
see
that
a
blind
force
of
commerce
has
transformed
the
prayer
for
work
into
the
curse
of
enforced
unemployment
that
abstinence
is
impossible
or
cruel
and
that
lastly
morals
always
remain
ineffective
if
commended
by
those
of
whom
the
poet
says
that
they
drink
wine
in
secret
but
preach
water
in
public
thirty
years
after
sismondi
and
owen
twenty
years
after
the
indictment
made
by
the
english
socialists
the
followers
of
ricardo
and
last
but
not
least
after
the
publication
of
the
communist
manifesto
such
bold
words
alone
can
not
claim
to
break
new
ground
what
matters
above
all
now
is
the
theoretical
foundation
of
this
indictment
rodbertus
here
proposed
a
complete
system
which
can
be
reduced
to
the
following
simple
statements
owing
to
the
laws
of
an
economy
left
to
its
own
devices
the
high
level
of
labour
productivity
achieved
by
history
together
with
the
institutions
of
positive
law
that
is
to
say
the
right
of
private
ownership
a
whole
series
of
wrong
and
unethical
phenomena
had
emerged
in
the
place
of
value
we
have
exchange
value
and
accordingly
coined
money
instead
of
a
proper
or
currency
which
would
genuinely
correspond
to
the
concept
of
money
the
first
principle
is
that
all
economic
goods
are
products
of
labour
or
as
we
might
put
it
that
labour
alone
is
creative
this
statement
however
does
not
imply
that
the
value
of
the
product
must
always
equal
the
cost
of
labour
or
that
in
other
words
value
is
even
now
measured
in
terms
of
labour
the
truth
is
rather
this
still
has
not
become
a
but
is
only
an
of
political
economy
the
value
could
be
constituted
in
accordance
with
the
labour
expended
on
the
product
we
might
imagine
a
kind
of
money
which
would
be
as
it
were
a
leaf
torn
from
the
public
a
receipt
written
on
the
most
rubbishy
material
on
rags
which
everyone
would
receive
for
the
value
he
has
produced
and
which
he
would
realise
as
a
voucher
for
an
equivalent
part
of
the
national
product
subsequently
under
distribution
if
however
for
some
reason
or
another
it
is
or
yet
to
establish
this
value
money
as
such
must
still
retain
the
value
it
is
designed
to
liquidate
made
of
an
intrinsically
valuable
commodity
like
gold
or
silver
it
has
to
represent
a
pledge
or
pawn
of
the
same
value
soon
as
capitalist
commodity
production
has
come
into
existence
everything
is
turned
upside
down
there
can
no
longer
be
a
constituted
value
since
it
can
only
be
exchange
value
and
the
value
can
not
be
constituted
money
can
not
be
money
it
can
not
fully
conform
to
its
concept
in
an
equitable
exchange
the
exchange
value
of
the
products
would
have
to
equal
the
quantity
of
labour
needed
for
producing
them
and
an
exchange
of
products
would
always
mean
an
exchange
of
equal
quantities
of
labour
even
assuming
however
that
everybody
produced
just
those
which
another
person
requires
yet
we
are
here
concerned
with
human
discernment
and
human
volition
there
must
always
be
for
a
start
a
correct
calculation
adjustment
and
allocation
of
the
labour
quantities
contained
in
the
products
for
exchange
there
must
be
a
to
which
the
facts
will
conform
it
is
that
rodbertus
in
his
discovery
of
value
laid
great
stress
on
his
priority
to
proudhon
which
we
shall
gladly
concede
him
marx
in
his
of
and
engels
in
his
preface
to
it
have
comprehensively
shown
that
this
is
a
mere
phantom
still
used
in
theory
but
in
practice
buried
already
in
england
well
before
rodbertus
time
that
it
is
but
a
utopian
distortion
of
ricardo
doctrine
of
value
we
therefore
need
not
deal
further
with
this
of
the
future
performed
on
a
toy
trumpet
the
of
exchange
resulted
in
the
of
labour
to
a
commodity
the
labour
wage
being
determined
as
an
item
of
expenditure
der
instead
of
representing
a
fixed
rate
of
the
national
product
by
a
daring
jump
in
history
rodbertus
derives
his
wages
law
indirectly
from
slavery
and
regards
the
specific
traits
which
a
capitalist
production
of
commodities
imposes
on
exploitation
as
no
more
than
a
lying
deception
against
which
he
fulminates
from
a
moral
point
of
view
long
as
the
producers
themselves
remained
the
property
of
those
who
were
not
producing
so
long
as
slavery
was
in
existence
it
was
the
advantage
of
the
masters
alone
which
unilaterally
determined
the
volume
of
this
share
of
the
workers
with
the
producers
attaining
full
liberty
of
person
if
nothing
more
as
yet
both
parties
agree
on
the
wage
in
advance
the
wage
in
modern
terminology
is
the
object
of
a
free
contract
that
is
to
say
an
object
of
competition
labour
is
therefore
as
a
matter
of
course
subjected
to
the
same
laws
of
exchange
as
its
products
labour
itself
acquires
exchange
value
the
size
of
the
wage
depends
on
the
effects
of
supply
and
demand
rodbertus
after
having
thus
turned
everything
upside
down
after
deriving
the
exchange
value
of
labour
from
competition
now
immediately
derives
its
value
from
its
exchange
value
the
laws
of
exchange
value
labour
like
produced
goods
comes
to
have
a
kind
of
cost
value
which
exercises
some
magnetic
effects
upon
its
exchange
value
the
amount
of
the
labour
wage
it
is
that
particular
amount
of
payment
which
is
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
labour
in
other
words
which
enables
labour
to
continue
if
only
in
the
persons
of
its
progeny
it
is
the
minimum
of
subsistence
for
rodbertus
however
this
is
not
a
statement
of
objective
economic
laws
but
merely
an
object
for
moral
indignation
he
calls
the
thesis
of
the
classical
school
that
labour
is
worth
no
more
than
the
wages
it
can
command
a
statement
and
he
is
determined
to
expose
the
of
lies
leading
to
this
and
unethical
conclusion
was
a
degrading
view
to
estimate
the
wages
of
labour
in
accordance
with
the
necessary
subsistence
like
so
many
machines
to
be
kept
in
repair
now
that
labour
the
fountainhead
of
all
commodities
has
itself
become
a
commodity
of
exchange
it
is
no
less
degrading
to
speak
of
its
natural
price
of
its
costs
just
as
we
speak
of
the
natural
price
and
costs
of
its
product
and
to
include
this
natural
price
these
costs
in
the
amount
of
goods
that
is
necessary
to
call
forth
a
continuous
flow
of
labour
on
the
market
this
commodity
character
of
labour
power
however
and
the
corresponding
determination
of
its
value
are
nothing
but
a
malicious
misrepresentation
of
the
free
trade
school
like
the
good
prussian
he
was
rodbertus
put
capitalist
commodity
production
as
a
whole
in
the
dock
as
offending
against
the
obtaining
constitutional
law
instead
of
pointing
out
its
inherent
contradiction
the
conflict
between
determining
the
value
of
labour
and
determining
the
value
labour
as
the
english
disciples
of
ricardo
had
done
beyond
words
he
exclaims
the
dualist
conception
of
those
economists
who
would
have
the
workers
as
far
as
their
legal
status
is
concerned
join
in
deciding
the
fate
of
society
and
would
for
all
that
have
these
same
workers
from
an
economic
point
of
view
always
treated
as
mere
commodities
now
it
only
remains
to
find
out
why
the
workers
put
up
with
such
stupid
and
blatant
injustice
an
objection
which
hermann
for
instance
raised
against
ricardo
theory
of
value
rodbertus
is
ready
with
this
answer
were
the
workers
to
do
after
their
emancipation
other
than
to
agree
to
these
regulations
imagine
their
position
when
the
workers
were
freed
they
were
naked
or
in
rags
they
had
nothing
but
their
labour
power
the
abolition
of
slavery
or
serfdom
moreover
rescinded
the
master
legal
or
moral
obligation
to
feed
them
and
care
for
their
needs
yet
these
needs
remained
they
still
had
to
live
how
then
could
their
labour
power
provide
them
with
a
living
were
they
simply
to
grab
some
of
the
capital
existing
in
the
society
for
their
maintenance
the
capital
of
society
was
already
in
the
hands
of
other
people
and
the
organs
of
the
law
would
not
have
tolerated
such
a
step
what
then
could
the
workers
have
done
only
these
alternatives
were
before
them
either
to
overthrow
the
law
of
society
or
to
return
under
roughly
the
same
conditions
as
before
to
their
former
masters
the
owners
of
the
land
and
of
capital
and
to
receive
as
wages
what
was
formerly
doled
out
to
them
to
keep
them
fed
it
was
fortunate
for
mankind
and
the
prussian
state
that
the
workers
were
enough
not
to
overthrow
civilisation
and
preferred
to
submit
to
the
demands
of
their
masters
this
then
is
the
origin
of
the
capitalist
wage
system
of
the
wages
law
as
kind
of
slavery
resulting
from
an
abuse
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
capitalists
and
from
the
precarious
position
and
the
meek
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
the
proletariat
if
we
are
to
believe
the
highly
original
explanations
of
that
very
rodbertus
whose
theories
marx
is
reputed
to
have
let
rodbertus
claim
in
this
particular
theory
of
value
without
challenge
seeing
that
english
socialists
and
other
social
critics
had
already
given
far
less
crude
and
primitive
analyses
of
the
the
singular
point
about
it
all
is
that
rodbertus
display
of
moral
indignation
about
the
origin
and
the
economic
laws
of
the
wages
system
does
not
lead
up
to
the
demand
for
doing
away
with
this
abominable
injustice
the
stupid
beyond
words
far
from
it
he
frequently
reassures
his
that
he
does
not
really
mean
anything
very
serious
by
roaring
he
is
no
lion
fell
only
one
snug
the
joiner
indeed
an
ethical
theory
of
the
wages
law
is
necessary
only
to
achieve
a
further
conclusion
since
the
of
exchange
value
determine
the
wage
an
advance
in
labour
productivity
must
bring
about
an
ever
declining
share
in
the
product
for
the
workers
here
we
have
arrived
at
the
archimedean
fulcrum
of
rodbertus
system
this
wage
rate
is
his
most
important
discovery
on
which
he
harps
from
his
first
writings
on
social
problems
probably
in
until
his
death
and
which
he
as
his
very
own
this
conception
for
all
that
was
but
a
simple
corollary
of
ricardo
theory
of
value
and
is
contained
implicit
in
the
wages
fund
theory
which
dominated
bourgeois
economics
up
to
the
publication
of
marx
rodbertus
nevertheless
believed
that
this
made
him
a
kind
of
galileo
in
economics
and
he
refers
to
his
wage
rate
as
explaining
every
evil
and
contradiction
in
capitalist
economy
above
all
he
derives
from
the
declining
wage
rate
the
phenomenon
of
pauperism
which
together
with
the
crises
in
his
opinion
constitutes
the
social
question
it
would
be
as
well
to
draw
the
attention
of
contemporaries
for
marx
blood
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
marx
but
rodbertus
a
man
much
nearer
their
own
heart
who
set
up
a
whole
theory
of
progressive
poverty
in
a
very
crude
form
and
that
he
unlike
marx
made
it
the
very
pivot
not
just
a
symptom
of
the
entire
social
problem
compare
for
instance
his
argument
in
his
first
on
social
to
kirchmann
on
the
absolute
impoverishment
of
the
working
class
the
wage
rate
must
serve
in
addition
to
explain
the
other
fundamental
phenomena
of
the
social
problem
the
crises
in
this
connection
rodbertus
tackles
the
problem
of
balancing
consumption
with
production
touching
upon
the
whole
lot
of
cognate
controversial
issues
which
had
already
been
fought
out
between
the
schools
of
sismondi
and
ricardo
rodbertus
knowledge
of
crises
was
of
course
based
upon
far
more
material
evidence
than
that
of
sismondi
in
his
first
on
social
he
already
gives
a
detailed
description
of
the
four
crises
in
and
since
his
observations
covered
a
much
longer
period
rodbertus
could
by
and
large
gain
a
much
deeper
insight
into
the
essential
character
of
crises
than
his
predecessors
as
early
as
he
formulated
the
periodical
character
of
the
crises
which
recur
at
ever
shorter
intervals
and
at
the
same
time
with
ever
increasing
severity
after
time
these
crises
have
become
more
terrible
in
proportion
with
the
increase
in
wealth
engulfing
an
ever
greater
number
of
victims
the
crisis
of
although
even
this
caused
panic
in
commerce
and
inspired
misgivings
in
economics
was
of
small
importance
compared
to
that
of
the
first
crisis
had
made
such
inroads
on
the
capital
assets
of
england
that
the
most
famous
economists
doubted
whether
complete
recovery
could
ever
be
made
yet
it
was
eclipsed
by
the
crisis
of
the
crises
of
and
wrought
even
greater
havoc
than
previous
ones
to
recent
experiences
however
the
crises
recur
at
ever
shorter
intervals
there
was
a
lapse
of
years
between
the
first
and
the
third
crisis
of
years
between
the
second
and
the
fourth
and
of
only
years
between
the
third
and
the
fifth
already
the
signs
are
multiplying
that
a
new
disaster
is
imminent
though
no
doubt
the
events
of
put
off
the
catastrophe
rodbertus
remarks
that
an
extraordinary
boom
in
production
and
great
progress
in
industrial
technique
always
are
the
heralds
of
a
crisis
one
of
them
of
the
crises
followed
upon
a
period
of
outstanding
industrial
prosperity
from
the
crises
in
history
he
demonstrates
that
occur
only
after
a
considerable
increase
of
productivity
rodbertus
opposes
what
he
terms
the
vulgar
view
which
conceives
of
crises
as
mere
disturbances
in
the
monetary
and
credit
system
and
he
criticises
the
whole
of
currency
legislation
as
an
error
of
judgment
arguing
the
point
in
detail
in
his
essay
commercial
crises
and
the
mortgage
there
he
makes
the
following
comment
among
others
would
therefore
deceive
ourselves
if
we
were
to
regard
commercial
crises
merely
as
crises
of
the
monetary
banking
or
credit
system
this
is
only
their
outer
semblance
when
they
first
emerge
rodbertus
also
shows
a
remarkably
acute
grasp
of
the
part
played
by
foreign
trade
in
the
problem
of
crises
just
like
sismondi
he
states
the
necessity
of
expansion
for
capitalist
production
but
he
simultaneously
emphasises
the
fact
that
the
periodical
crises
are
bound
to
grow
in
volume
trade
he
says
related
to
slumps
only
as
charity
is
related
to
poverty
they
ultimately
only
enhance
one
another
and
further
only
possible
means
of
warding
off
further
outbreaks
of
crises
is
the
application
of
the
knife
of
expanding
foreign
markets
the
violent
urge
towards
such
expansion
is
largely
no
more
but
a
morbid
irritation
caused
by
a
sickly
organ
since
one
factor
on
the
home
market
productivity
is
ever
increasing
and
the
other
factor
purchasing
power
remains
constant
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
population
commerce
must
endeavour
to
conjure
up
a
similarly
unlimited
amount
of
purchasing
power
on
the
foreign
market
in
this
way
the
irritation
may
be
soothed
to
some
extent
so
that
at
least
there
will
not
be
a
new
outbreak
of
the
calamity
right
away
every
foreign
market
opened
defers
the
social
problem
in
a
like
manner
colonisation
of
primitive
countries
would
have
similar
effects
europe
rears
a
market
for
herself
in
places
where
none
had
been
before
yet
such
a
medicine
would
essentially
do
no
more
than
appease
the
as
soon
as
the
new
markets
are
supplied
the
problem
will
revert
to
its
former
state
a
conflict
between
the
two
factors
limited
purchasing
power
versus
unlimited
productivity
the
new
attack
would
be
warded
off
the
small
market
only
to
in
even
wider
dimensions
and
with
even
more
violent
incidents
on
a
larger
one
and
since
the
earth
is
finite
and
the
acquisition
of
new
markets
must
some
time
come
to
an
end
the
time
will
come
when
the
question
can
no
longer
be
simply
adjourned
sooner
or
later
a
definite
solution
will
have
to
be
found
rodbertus
also
recognises
the
anarchical
character
of
capitalist
private
enterprise
to
be
conducive
to
crises
but
only
as
one
factor
among
many
seeing
it
as
the
source
of
a
particular
type
of
crises
not
as
the
real
cause
of
crises
in
general
about
the
crises
at
kirchmann
he
says
maintain
that
a
slump
of
this
kind
does
not
occur
in
real
life
the
market
of
is
large
there
are
countless
wants
and
many
branches
of
production
productivity
is
considerable
and
the
data
of
commerce
are
obscure
and
misleading
the
individual
entrepreneur
does
not
know
how
much
others
are
producing
and
so
it
may
easily
happen
that
he
the
demand
for
a
certain
commodity
with
which
he
will
then
overstock
the
market
rodbertus
says
outright
that
the
only
remedy
for
these
crises
is
the
reversal
of
contemporary
or
a
planned
economy
concentrating
all
means
of
production
the
hands
of
a
single
social
authority
to
set
troubled
minds
at
rest
however
he
is
quick
to
add
that
he
reserves
judgment
as
to
whether
there
can
actually
be
such
a
state
of
affairs
this
would
be
the
only
possible
way
to
prevent
slumps
of
this
kind
thus
he
expressly
regards
anarchy
in
the
modern
mode
of
production
as
responsible
for
only
a
specific
and
partial
manifestation
of
crises
rodbertus
scornfully
rejects
axiom
of
a
natural
equilibrium
between
consumption
and
production
just
like
sismondi
he
emphasises
that
everything
turns
on
the
purchasing
power
of
society
and
also
takes
it
to
be
dependent
upon
the
distribution
of
income
all
the
same
he
does
not
endorse
sismondi
theory
of
crises
and
disagrees
sharply
with
the
conclusions
drawn
from
it
if
sismondi
saw
the
source
of
all
evil
in
the
unlimited
expansion
of
production
without
regard
to
the
limitations
of
incomes
and
advocated
a
restriction
of
production
rodbertus
quite
on
the
contrary
champions
the
most
powerful
and
unrestricted
expansion
of
production
of
wealth
and
of
the
productive
forces
believing
this
to
be
a
social
necessity
whoever
rejects
the
wealth
of
society
rejects
at
the
same
time
its
power
its
progress
and
with
its
progress
its
virtues
whoever
stands
in
the
way
of
growing
wealth
stands
in
the
way
of
all
social
progress
whatever
every
increase
in
knowledge
resolve
and
capacity
is
conceived
as
bound
up
with
an
increase
in
wealth
from
this
point
of
view
rodbertus
is
strongly
in
favour
of
issuing
houses
which
he
regards
as
the
indispensable
foundations
for
a
rapid
and
unrestricted
expansion
of
company
promoting
both
his
essay
of
on
the
mortgage
problem
and
the
treatise
on
the
crisis
in
are
devoted
to
this
plea
he
even
polemises
outright
against
the
sismondian
type
of
as
usual
broaching
the
matter
first
from
his
peculiar
utopian
ethics
entrepreneurs
he
holds
forth
essentially
civil
servants
of
economy
by
the
institution
of
property
they
are
once
and
for
all
entrusted
with
the
nation
means
of
production
if
they
set
them
to
work
and
strain
all
their
energies
in
the
process
they
do
but
their
duty
since
capital
let
me
repeat
exists
entirely
for
the
sake
of
production
and
a
further
factual
argument
would
you
have
them
the
entrepreneurs
turn
acute
attacks
of
suffering
into
a
chronic
state
by
working
persistently
and
from
the
first
with
fewer
forces
than
are
given
by
the
means
of
production
are
they
to
pay
for
a
less
severe
form
of
the
evil
with
its
permanent
duration
even
if
we
were
silly
enough
to
give
them
this
advice
they
would
not
be
able
to
follow
it
how
could
the
entrepreneurs
of
the
world
recognise
the
limits
beyond
which
the
market
would
cease
to
be
healthy
they
engage
in
production
without
knowing
the
one
of
the
other
they
are
producing
in
the
most
distant
corners
of
the
earth
for
a
market
hundreds
of
miles
away
they
produce
with
such
vast
forces
that
a
month
production
may
already
overstep
the
limit
how
could
production
so
divided
and
yet
so
powerful
conceivably
estimate
in
good
time
what
will
be
enough
where
for
instance
are
the
organisations
the
statistical
bureaux
and
the
like
to
help
them
in
this
task
what
is
worse
the
price
alone
its
rise
and
fall
indicates
the
position
of
the
market
and
this
is
not
like
a
barometer
which
predicts
the
temperature
of
the
market
but
more
like
a
thermometer
which
only
registers
it
if
the
price
falls
the
limit
has
been
passed
already
and
the
evil
is
with
us
these
thrusts
obviously
aimed
at
sismondi
exhibit
quite
fundamental
differences
between
the
two
opponents
if
engels
then
says
in
his
that
sismondi
first
explained
the
crises
as
resulting
from
and
that
rodbertus
borrowed
this
view
from
him
he
is
not
strictly
accurate
all
that
rodbertus
and
sismondi
have
in
common
is
their
opposition
against
the
classical
school
and
the
general
explanation
of
crises
as
the
result
of
the
distribution
of
incomes
even
in
this
connection
rodbertus
mounts
his
own
particular
hobby
horse
is
not
caused
by
the
low
level
of
working
class
incomes
nor
yet
as
sismondi
maintains
by
the
capitalists
limited
capacity
for
consumption
but
solely
by
the
fact
that
with
a
growing
productivity
of
labour
the
workers
income
in
terms
of
value
represents
an
ever
smaller
share
of
the
product
rodbertus
takes
pains
to
convince
the
opposition
that
it
is
not
the
small
volume
of
the
workers
share
which
causes
the
crises
imagine
he
goes
on
to
lecture
kirchmann
shares
to
be
so
small
as
to
ensure
only
a
bare
subsistence
for
those
who
are
entitled
to
them
as
long
as
you
establish
them
as
representing
a
proportion
of
the
national
product
you
will
have
a
constant
vessel
for
value
which
can
absorb
ever
increasing
contents
and
an
ever
increasing
prosperity
of
the
working
classes
as
well
and
now
imagine
on
the
contrary
as
large
a
share
for
the
working
classes
as
you
please
and
let
it
become
an
ever
smaller
fraction
of
the
national
product
that
grows
with
increasing
productivity
then
provided
it
is
not
reduced
to
the
present
pittance
this
share
will
still
protect
the
workers
from
undue
privations
since
the
amount
of
products
it
represents
will
still
be
considerably
greater
than
it
is
once
this
share
begins
to
decline
however
there
will
be
spreading
discontent
culminating
in
a
commercial
crisis
for
which
the
capitalists
are
not
to
blame
inasmuch
as
they
did
no
more
than
their
duty
in
laying
down
the
volume
of
production
according
to
the
given
magnitude
of
these
shares
that
is
why
the
wage
rate
is
the
real
cause
of
crises
it
can
only
be
counteracted
by
legal
measures
to
ensure
that
the
share
represents
a
stable
and
unchanging
rate
of
the
national
product
this
grotesque
notion
takes
some
understanding
if
we
are
to
do
justice
to
its
economic
implications

it
can

provide

if
it

it
is

partake

the

drive
for

which
impelled

accomplished

is
to
say
the

committed
by

british
in

of

in

had
expressed
the
conviction
that
if

the
resolution
necessary
to
solve
the
social
question

change
the
distribution
of

to
crack

of

ethics
over
the

it
is
of

what
one
might
expect
of
the

in

that
he
should
also
be

supporter
of

his
phrase
about
the
of

is
but
poetic
licence
in
his
verbal
fireworks

his
essay

understanding
of

explains
that
the
national
tax
burden
is
perpetually
gravitating
towards
the
bottom
sometimes
in
form
of
higher
prices
for
wage
goods
and
sometimes
in

connection

considers
conscription
the

are

of

to
begin
with
what
does
it
mean
that
a
decrease
in
the
workers
share
is
bound
immediately
to
engender
and
commercial
crises
such
a
view
can
only
make
sense
provided
rodbertus
takes
the
product
to
consist
of
two
parts
the
shares
of
the
workers
and
of
the
capitalists
in
short
of
one
share
being
exchangeable
for
the
other
and
that
is
more
or
less
what
he
actually
seems
to
say
on
occasions
in
his
first
on
social
poverty
of
the
working
classes
precludes
their
income
from
giving
scope
to
increasing
production
the
additional
amount
of
products
from
the
entrepreneurs
point
of
view
lowers
the
value
of
the
aggregate
product
so
far
as
to
bar
production
on
the
former
scale
leaving
the
workers
at
best
to
their
accustomed
straits
though
if
it
could
be
made
available
to
the
workers
it
would
not
only
improve
their
lot
but
would
further
act
as
a
counterweight
by
increasing
the
value
of
what
is
retained
by
the
capitalists
and
so
enable
the
latter
to
keep
their
enterprises
at
the
same
level
the
which
in
the
hand
of
the
workers
increases
the
of
is
retained
by
the
entrepreneurs
can
in
this
context
only
be
the
demand
once
again
we
have
landed
happily
at
the
familiar
of
kirchmann
where
workers
and
capitalists
exchange
their
incomes
for
the
surplus
product
and
where
the
crises
arise
because
variable
capital
is
small
and
the
surplus
value
large
this
peculiar
notion
has
already
been
dealt
with
above
there
are
other
occasions
however
when
rodbertus
advances
a
somewhat
different
conception
the
interpretation
of
his
theory
in
the
fourth
on
social
is
that
the
continual
shifts
in
the
relations
of
demand
evident
in
the
share
of
the
working
class
and
caused
by
the
share
of
the
capitalist
class
must
result
in
a
chronic
disproportion
between
production
and
consumption
if
the
entrepreneurs
endeavour
to
keep
always
within
the
limits
of
those
shares
yet
the
shares
themselves
are
all
the
time
on
the
decline
for
the
great
majority
of
the
society
the
workers
decreasing
gradually
unnoticeably
but
with
relentless
force
what
if
the
share
of
these
classes
is
continually
decreasing
to
the
same
extent
as
their
productivity
is
increasing
it
not
really
the
fact
that
the
capitalists
of
necessity
organise
production
in
accordance
with
the
present
volume
of
shares
in
order
to
make
wealth
universal
and
that
yet
they
always
produce
over
and
above
this
volume
of
previous
shares
thereby
perpetuating
dissatisfaction
which
culminates
in
this
stagnation
of
trade
on
this
showing
the
explanation
of
crises
should
be
as
follows
the
national
product
consists
of
a
number
of
goods
as
kirchmann
puts
it
for
the
workers
and
of
superior
goods
for
the
capitalists
the
wages
represent
the
quantity
of
the
former
and
aggregate
surplus
value
that
of
the
latter
if
the
capitalists
organise
their
production
on
this
footing
and
if
at
the
same
time
there
is
progressive
productivity
a
lack
of
proportion
will
immediately
ensue
for
the
share
of
the
workers
is
no
longer
that
of
yesterday
but
less
if
the
demand
for
goods
had
involved
say
of
the
national
product
yesterday
then
it
involves
only
and
the
entrepreneurs
having
provided
for
of
goods
will
find
to
their
painful
surprise
that
they
by
now
wiser
by
this
experience
they
try
to
organise
output
of
goods
to
a
mere
of
the
total
value
of
the
national
product
but
they
have
a
new
disappointment
coming
to
them
since
the
share
of
the
national
product
falling
to
wages
is
bound
to
be
only
and
so
on
in
this
ingenious
theory
there
are
quite
a
few
points
to
make
us
wonder
if
our
commercial
crises
are
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
rate
the
variable
capital
represents
a
constantly
diminishing
portion
of
the
total
value
of
the
national
product
then
this
unfortunate
law
brings
with
it
the
cure
for
the
evil
it
has
caused
since
it
must
be
an
ever
smaller
part
of
the
aggregate
product
for
which
there
is
although
rodbertus
delights
in
such
terms
as
overwhelming
majority
large
popular
masses
of
consumers
it
is
not
the
number
of
heads
that
make
up
the
demand
but
the
value
they
represent
which
is
relevant
this
value
if
rodbertus
is
to
be
believed
forms
a
more
and
more
trifling
part
of
the
aggregate
product
crises
are
thus
made
to
rest
on
an
ever
narrowing
economic
basis
and
all
that
remains
to
discover
is
how
in
spite
of
it
all
it
can
still
happen
that
the
crises
are
universal
and
increasingly
severe
besides
as
rodbertus
is
fully
aware
the
purchasing
power
lost
by
the
working
classes
should
be
gained
by
the
capitalist
class
if
decreases
must
grow
larger
to
make
up
for
it
on
this
crude
scheme
the
purchasing
power
of
society
as
a
whole
can
not
change
as
rodbertus
says
in
so
many
words
know
very
well
that
what
is
taken
from
the
workers
share
goes
ultimately
to
swell
that
of
the
rentiers
rent
and
surplus
value
are
used
as
synonyms
and
that
purchasing
power
remains
constant
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
but
as
far
as
the
product
on
the
market
is
concerned
the
crisis
always
sets
in
before
this
increase
can
make
itself
felt
in
short
the
most
it
can
amount
to
is
that
there
is
much
of
goods
and
little
of
superior
goods
for
the
capitalists
quite
unawares
and
by
devious
ways
rodbertus
here
falls
in
with
the
theory
he
so
ardently
contested
the
theory
that
on
one
side
always
corresponds
to
on
the
other
seeing
that
the
ratio
of
the
two
shares
is
persistently
shifting
to
the
advantage
of
the
capitalists
our
commercial
crises
might
be
expected
on
the
whole
to
take
on
increasingly
the
character
of
periodical
instead
of
enough
of
this
exercise
in
logic
the
upshot
of
it
all
is
that
rodbertus
conceives
the
national
product
in
respect
of
its
value
as
made
up
of
two
parts
only
of
and
thus
wholly
subscribing
to
the
views
and
traditions
of
the
classical
school
he
is
fighting
tooth
and
nail
and
even
adding
his
own
flourish
that
the
capitalists
consume
the
entire
surplus
value
that
is
why
he
repeatedly
says
without
mincing
his
words
as
in
the
fourth
on
social
we
must
abstract
from
the
reasons
which
cause
the
division
of
rent
in
general
into
rent
proper
and
capital
rent
to
find
the
basic
principle
underlying
the
division
of
rent
surplus
value
in
general
the
principle
underlying
division
of
the
labour
product
into
wage
and
and
in
the
third
rent
capital
profit
and
the
wage
of
labour
are
let
me
repeat
revenue
by
this
means
landlords
capitalists
and
workers
must
live
must
satisfy
that
is
to
say
their
immediate
human
necessities
they
must
therefore
draw
their
income
in
the
form
of
goods
suitable
for
this
purpose
the
misrepresentation
of
capitalist
economy
has
never
been
formulated
more
crudely
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
rodbertus
claims
the
palm
of
not
so
much
over
marx
as
over
all
popular
economists
with
full
justification
to
leave
the
reader
in
no
doubt
about
the
utter
muddle
he
has
made
he
goes
on
in
the
same
letter
to
rank
capitalist
surplus
value
as
an
economic
category
on
the
same
level
as
the
revenue
of
the
ancient
first
state
that
of
slavery
goes
with
the
most
primitive
natural
economy
that
portion
of
the
labour
product
which
is
withheld
from
the
income
of
workers
or
slaves
and
forms
the
master
or
owner
property
will
undividedly
accrue
to
the
one
man
who
owns
the
land
the
capital
the
worker
and
the
labour
product
there
is
not
even
a
distinction
of
thought
between
rent
and
capital
the
second
state
entails
the
most
complicated
money
economy
that
portion
of
the
labour
product
withheld
from
the
income
of
the
now
emancipated
workers
and
accruing
to
the
respective
owners
of
land
and
capital
will
be
further
divided
among
the
owners
of
the
raw
material
and
the
manufactured
product
respectively
the
one
rent
of
the
former
state
will
be
split
up
into
ground
rent
and
capital
profits
and
will
have
to
be
differentiated
accordingly
rodbertus
regards
the
of
the
surplus
value
from
the
workers
as
the
most
striking
difference
between
exploitation
by
slavery
and
modern
capitalist
exploitation
it
is
not
the
specific
historical
form
of
sharing
out
newly
created
value
among
labour
and
capital
but
the
distribution
of
the
surplus
value
among
the
various
people
it
benefits
which
irrelevant
to
the
productive
process
is
yet
the
decisive
fact
in
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
in
all
other
respects
capitalist
surplus
value
remains
just
the
same
as
the
old
rent
of
the
a
private
fund
for
the
own
consumption
yet
rodbertus
again
contradicts
himself
in
other
places
remembering
all
of
a
sudden
the
constant
capital
and
the
necessity
for
its
renewal
in
the
reproductive
process
thus
instead
of
bisecting
the
aggregate
product
into
and
he
posits
a
triple
division
and
in
his
third
on
social
he
argues
on
the
forms
of
reproduction
in
a
the
master
will
see
to
it
that
part
of
the
slave
labour
is
employed
in
maintaining
or
even
improving
the
fields
herds
agricultural
and
manufacturing
tools
there
will
be
capital
replacement
to
use
a
modern
term
in
which
part
of
the
national
economic
product
is
immediately
used
for
the
upkeep
of
the
estate
without
any
mediation
by
exchange
or
even
by
exchange
value
and
passing
on
to
capitalist
reproduction
he
continues
in
terms
of
value
one
portion
of
the
labour
product
is
used
or
set
aside
for
the
maintenance
of
the
estate
for
capital
replacement
another
for
the
workers
subsistence
as
their
money
wage
and
the
owners
of
the
land
of
capital
and
of
the
labour
product
retain
the
last
as
their
revenue
or
rent
this
then
is
an
explicit
expression
of
the
triple
division
into
constant
capital
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
again
in
this
third
he
formulates
the
peculiarity
of
his
theory
with
equal
precision
this
theory
then
and
under
conditions
of
adequate
labour
productivity
the
portion
of
the
product
which
remains
for
wages
after
the
replacement
of
capital
will
be
distributed
among
workers
and
owners
as
wages
and
rent
on
the
basis
of
the
ownership
in
land
and
capital
it
does
seem
now
as
if
rodbertus
analysis
of
the
value
of
the
aggregate
product
represents
a
distinct
advance
over
the
classical
school
even
adam
smith
is
openly
criticised
a
little
further
on
and
it
is
really
surprising
that
rodbertus
learned
admirers
wagner
dietzel
diehl
failed
to
claim
their
boy
over
marx
on
such
an
important
point
of
economic
theory
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
respect
no
less
than
in
the
general
theory
of
value
rodbertus
priority
is
of
a
somewhat
dubious
character
if
he
seems
on
occasion
to
gain
true
insight
it
immediately
turns
out
to
be
a
misunderstanding
or
at
best
a
wrong
approach
his
criticism
of
adam
smith
dogma
affords
a
supreme
example
of
his
failure
to
cope
with
the
triple
division
of
the
national
product
towards
which
he
had
groped
his
way
he
says
literally
know
that
all
economists
since
adam
smith
already
divided
the
value
of
the
product
into
wage
of
labour
rent
and
capital
profit
that
it
is
therefore
not
a
new
idea
to
ground
the
incomes
of
the
various
classes
and
especially
the
various
items
of
the
rent
in
a
division
of
the
product
but
the
economists
at
once
go
off
the
track
all
of
them
not
even
excepting
ricardo
school
make
the
mistake
first
not
to
recognise
that
the
aggregate
product
the
finished
good
the
national
product
as
a
whole
is
an
entity
in
which
workers
landowners
and
capitalists
all
share
but
conceiving
the
division
of
the
unfinished
product
to
be
of
one
kind
shared
among
three
partners
and
that
of
the
manufactured
product
as
of
another
kind
again
shared
between
only
two
partners
for
these
theories
both
the
unfinished
product
and
the
manufactured
product
constitute
as
such
separate
items
of
revenue
secondly
though
both
sismondi
and
ricardo
are
free
from
this
particular
error
they
regard
the
natural
fact
that
labour
can
not
produce
goods
without
material
help
without
the
land
as
an
economic
fact
and
take
the
social
fact
for
a
primary
datum
that
capital
as
understood
is
required
by
the
division
of
labour
thus
they
set
up
the
fiction
of
a
fundamental
economic
relationship
on
which
they
base
also
for
the
shares
of
the
various
owners
ground
rent
springing
from
the
contribution
of
the
land
lent
by
the
owner
to
production
capital
profits
from
the
contribution
of
capital
employed
by
the
capitalist
to
this
end
and
the
wages
finally
from
contribution
seeing
that
there
are
separate
owners
of
land
capital
and
labour
in
the
society
say
school
elaborating
on
this
mistake
with
much
ingenuity
even
invented
the
concept
of
productive
service
of
land
capital
and
labour
in
conformity
with
the
shares
in
the
product
of
their
respective
owners
so
as
to
explain
these
shares
as
the
result
of
productive
thirdly
they
are
caught
up
in
the
ultimate
folly
of
deriving
the
wage
of
labour
and
the
items
of
rent
from
the
value
of
the
product
the
value
of
the
product
in
turn
being
derived
from
the
wage
of
labour
and
the
items
of
rent
so
that
the
one
is
made
to
depend
on
the
other
and
this
absurdity
is
quite
unmistakable
when
some
of
these
authors
attempt
to
expound
the
influence
of
rent
upon
production
prices
and
the
influence
of
production
prices
upon
rent
in
two
consecutive
chapters
yet
for
all
these
excellent
critical
comments
the
last
particularly
acute
actually
does
to
some
extent
anticipate
marx
criticism
of
this
point
in
volume
ii
rodbertus
calmly
falls
in
with
the
fundamental
blunder
of
the
classical
school
and
its
vulgar
followers
to
ignore
altogether
that
part
of
the
value
of
the
aggregate
product
which
is
needed
to
replace
the
constant
capital
of
the
society
this
way
it
was
easier
for
him
to
keep
up
the
singular
fight
against
the
wage
rate
under
capitalist
forms
of
production
the
value
of
the
aggregate
social
product
is
divided
into
three
parts
one
corresponding
to
the
value
of
the
constant
capital
the
second
to
the
wage
total
the
variable
capital
and
the
third
to
the
aggregate
surplus
value
of
the
capitalist
class
in
this
composition
the
portion
corresponding
to
the
variable
capital
is
relatively
on
the
decline
and
this
for
two
reasons
to
begin
with
the
relation
of
to
within
v
changes
all
the
time
in
the
direction
of
a
relative
increase
of
and
a
relative
decrease
of
this
is
the
simple
law
for
a
progressive
efficiency
of
human
labour
valid
for
all
societies
of
economic
progress
independently
of
their
historical
forms
a
formula
which
only
states
that
living
labour
is
increasingly
able
to
convert
more
means
of
production
into
objects
for
use
in
an
ever
shorter
time
and
if
decreases
as
a
whole
so
must
as
its
part
decrease
in
relation
to
the
total
value
of
the
product
to
kick
against
this
to
try
and
stop
the
decrease
would
be
tantamount
to
contending
against
the
general
effects
of
a
growing
labour
productivity
further
there
is
within
as
well
a
change
in
the
direction
of
a
relative
decrease
in
and
a
relative
increase
in
that
is
to
say
an
ever
smaller
part
of
the
newly
created
value
is
spent
on
wages
and
an
ever
greater
part
is
appropriated
as
surplus
value
this
is
the
specifically
capitalist
formula
of
progressive
labour
productivity
which
under
capitalist
conditions
of
production
is
no
less
valid
than
the
general
law
to
use
the
power
of
the
state
to
prevent
a
decrease
of
as
against
would
mean
that
the
fundamental
commodity
of
labour
power
is
debarred
from
this
progress
which
decreases
production
costs
for
all
commodities
it
would
mean
the
exemption
of
this
one
commodity
from
the
economic
effects
of
technical
progress
more
than
that
the
wage
rate
is
only
another
expression
of
the
rising
rate
of
surplus
value
which
forms
the
most
powerful
and
effective
means
of
checking
a
decline
of
the
profit
rate
and
which
therefore
represents
the
prime
incentive
for
capitalist
production
in
general
and
for
technical
progress
within
this
system
of
production
in
particular
doing
away
with
the
wage
rate
by
way
of
legislation
would
be
as
much
as
to
do
away
with
the
of
capitalist
society
to
deal
a
crippling
blow
to
its
entire
system
let
us
face
the
facts
the
individual
capitalist
just
like
capitalist
society
as
a
whole
has
no
glimmering
that
the
value
of
the
product
is
made
up
from
the
sum
total
of
labour
necessary
in
the
society
and
this
is
actually
beyond
his
grasp
value
as
the
capitalist
understands
it
is
the
derivative
form
reversed
by
competition
as
production
costs
while
in
truth
the
value
of
the
product
is
broken
down
into
the
values
of
its
component
fragments
and
the
capitalist
mind
conceives
of
it
as
the
summation
of
and
these
in
addition
also
appear
to
him
from
a
distorted
perspective
and
in
a
secondary
form
as
the
wear
and
tear
of
his
fixed
capital
his
advances
on
circulating
capital
including
workers
wages
and
the
current
profits
the
average
rate
of
profit
on
his
entire
capital
how
then
is
the
capitalist
to
be
compelled
by
a
law
say
of
the
kind
envisaged
by
rodbertus
to
maintain
a
wage
rate
in
the
face
of
the
aggregate
value
of
the
product
it
would
be
quite
as
brilliant
to
stipulate
by
law
for
exactly
no
more
no
less
of
the
total
price
of
the
product
to
be
payable
for
the
raw
materials
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
any
commodity
obviously
supreme
notion
of
which
he
was
so
proud
on
which
he
built
as
if
it
were
a
new
archimedean
discovery
which
was
to
be
the
specific
for
all
the
ills
of
capitalist
production
is
arrant
nonsense
from
all
aspects
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
it
could
only
result
from
the
muddle
in
the
theory
of
value
which
is
brought
to
a
head
in
inimitable
phrase
that
in
a
capitalist
society
the
product
must
have
just
as
it
had
to
have
in
ancient
economy
people
in
ancient
society
had
to
eat
bread
and
meat
in
order
to
live
but
we
of
are
already
satisfied
with
knowing
the
price
of
bread
and
of
meat
the
most
obvious
inference
from
monomania
about
a
wage
rate
is
that
he
is
quite
incapable
of
understanding
capitalist
accumulation
previous
quotations
have
already
shown
that
rodbertus
thinks
solely
of
simple
commodity
production
quite
in
keeping
with
his
mistaken
doctrine
that
the
purpose
of
capitalist
production
is
the
manufacture
of
consumer
goods
for
the
satisfaction
of
wants
for
he
always
talks
of
replacements
of
the
need
to
enable
the
capitalists
to
their
enterprise
on
the
previous
scale
his
principal
argument
however
is
directly
opposed
to
the
accumulation
of
capital
to
fix
the
rate
of
the
surplus
value
to
prevent
its
growth
is
tantamount
to
paralysing
the
accumulation
of
capital
both
sismondi
and
kirchmann
had
recognised
the
problem
of
balancing
production
and
consumption
to
be
indeed
a
problem
of
accumulation
that
is
to
say
of
enlarged
capitalist
reproduction
both
traced
the
disturbances
in
the
equilibrium
of
reproduction
to
accumulative
tendencies
denying
the
possibility
of
accumulation
with
the
only
difference
that
the
one
recommended
a
damper
on
the
productive
forces
as
a
remedy
while
the
other
favoured
their
increasing
employment
to
produce
luxuries
the
entire
surplus
value
to
be
consumed
in
this
field
too
rodbertus
follows
his
own
solitary
path
the
others
might
try
with
more
or
less
success
to
comprehend
the
of
capitalist
accumulation
but
rodbertus
prefers
to
fight
the
very
concept
since
adam
smith
have
one
after
the
other
echoed
the
principle
setting
it
up
as
a
universal
and
absolute
truth
that
capital
could
only
come
about
by
saving
and
accumulating
rodbertus
is
up
in
arms
against
this
judgment
over
sixty
pages
of
print
he
sets
out
in
detail
that
it
is
not
saving
which
is
the
source
of
capital
but
labour
that
the
about
hails
from
the
extravagant
view
that
capital
is
itself
productive
and
that
this
delusion
is
ultimately
due
to
another
the
error
that
capital
is
capital
kirchmann
for
his
part
understood
quite
well
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
capitalist
he
had
the
pretty
argument
knows
that
the
accumulation
of
capital
is
not
a
mere
hoarding
of
reserves
an
amassing
of
metal
and
monies
to
remain
idle
in
the
owners
vaults
those
who
want
to
save
do
it
for
the
sake
of
their
savings
either
personally
or
through
the
agency
of
others
as
capital
in
order
to
yield
them
revenue
that
is
only
possible
if
these
capitals
are
used
in
new
enterprises
which
can
produce
so
as
to
provide
the
required
interest
one
may
build
a
ship
another
a
barn
a
third
may
reclaim
a
desolate
swamp
a
fourth
may
order
a
new
spinning
frame
while
a
fifth
in
order
to
enlarge
his
business
would
buy
more
leather
and
employ
more
hands
and
so
on
only
if
the
capital
that
has
been
saved
is
employed
in
this
way
can
it
yield
interest
meaning
profit
and
the
latter
is
the
ultimate
object
of
all
saving
that
is
how
kirchmann
described
somewhat
clumsily
but
on
the
whole
correctly
what
is
in
fact
the
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
the
process
of
capitalist
accumulation
which
constitutes
the
whole
significance
of
saving
advocated
by
classical
economists
adam
smith
with
unerring
instinct
declaring
war
on
saving
and
accumulation
was
quite
in
keeping
with
kirchmann
premises
considering
that
he
like
sismondi
saw
the
immediate
cause
of
the
crises
in
accumulation
here
too
rodbertus
is
more
having
learned
from
theory
of
value
that
labour
is
the
source
of
all
value
and
consequently
of
capital
too
he
is
completely
blinded
by
this
elementary
piece
of
knowledge
to
the
entire
complexity
of
capitalist
production
and
capital
movements
since
capital
is
generated
by
labour
both
the
accumulation
of
capital
and
the
capitalisation
of
the
surplus
value
are
nothing
but
eyewash
in
order
to
untangle
this
intricate
network
of
errors
by
since
adam
smith
he
takes
as
we
might
expect
the
example
of
the
husbandman
and
proves
all
that
he
needs
by
a
vivisection
of
the
unhappy
creature
here
already
he
discovers
that
is
to
say
of
course
that
famous
stick
with
which
since
adam
smith
have
hooked
the
fruits
of
a
theory
of
capital
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
saving
be
able
to
produce
this
stick
is
his
query
and
since
every
normal
person
will
understand
that
can
not
produce
any
stick
that
robinson
crusoe
must
have
made
it
of
wood
we
have
already
proved
that
the
theory
is
quite
mistaken
presently
the
husbandman
hooks
a
fruit
from
the
tree
with
the
stick
and
this
fruit
is
his
capital
were
the
source
of
income
already
this
most
elementary
and
primitive
event
would
have
to
give
evidence
of
this
relation
would
it
be
true
to
say
then
without
doing
violence
to
facts
and
concepts
that
the
stick
is
a
of
income
or
of
part
of
the
income
consisting
in
the
fruit
brought
down
can
we
trace
income
wholly
or
in
part
back
to
the
stick
as
its
may
we
consider
it
wholly
or
in
parts
as
a
of
the
stick
surely
not
and
since
the
fruit
is
the
product
not
of
the
stick
which
brought
it
down
but
of
the
tree
which
grew
it
rodbertus
has
already
proved
that
all
since
adam
smith
are
grossly
mistaken
if
they
maintain
that
income
derives
from
capital
after
a
clear
exposition
of
all
fundamental
concepts
of
economics
on
the
example
of
robinson
crusoe
rodbertus
transfers
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
first
to
a
fictitious
society
ownership
in
capital
or
land
that
is
to
say
to
a
society
with
a
communist
mode
of
possession
and
then
to
a
society
ownership
in
capital
and
land
that
is
to
say
contemporary
society
and
lo
and
behold
all
the
laws
of
robinson
crusoe
economy
apply
point
for
point
to
these
two
forms
of
society
as
well
rodbertus
contrives
here
a
theory
of
capital
and
income
which
is
the
very
crown
of
his
utopian
imagination
since
he
has
discovered
that
robinson
crusoe
is
the
means
of
production
pure
and
simple
he
identifies
capital
with
the
means
of
production
in
capitalist
economy
as
well
thus
reducing
capital
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
constant
capital
he
protests
in
the
name
of
justice
and
morality
against
the
fact
that
the
wages
the
workers
means
of
subsistence
are
also
considered
capital
he
contends
furiously
against
the
of
variable
capital
seeing
in
it
the
cause
of
every
disaster
only
he
grieves
would
pay
attention
to
what
i
say
if
only
they
would
examine
without
prejudice
whether
they
are
right
or
i
this
is
the
focal
point
of
all
errors
about
capital
in
the
ruling
system
this
is
the
ultimate
source
of
injustice
against
the
working
classes
in
theory
and
practice
alike
for
demands
that
the
goods
constituting
the
wages
of
the
workers
be
counted
not
as
part
of
capital
but
as
belonging
to
the
category
of
income
though
rodbertus
knows
very
well
that
the
capitalist
must
regard
the
wages
he
has
as
part
of
his
capital
just
like
the
other
part
laid
out
on
immediate
means
of
production
yet
in
his
opinion
this
applies
only
to
individual
capitals
as
soon
as
it
is
a
question
of
the
social
aggregate
product
of
reproduction
as
a
whole
he
declares
the
capitalist
categories
of
production
an
illusion
a
malicious
lie
and
a
properly
the
items
which
make
up
capital
capital
from
the
nation
point
of
view
is
something
quite
different
from
private
capital
capital
capital
all
that
capital
in
the
modern
use
of
the
term
usually
stands
for
an
individual
capitalist
produces
by
capitalist
methods
but
society
as
a
whole
must
produce
like
robinson
crusoe
as
a
collective
owner
employing
communist
methods
makes
no
difference
from
this
general
and
national
point
of
view
that
greater
or
smaller
parts
of
the
aggregate
national
product
are
now
owned
in
all
the
various
phases
of
production
by
private
persons
who
must
not
be
numbered
among
the
producers
proper
and
that
the
latter
always
manufacture
this
national
aggregate
product
as
servants
without
sharing
in
the
ownership
of
their
own
product
of
these
few
owners
certain
peculiarities
of
the
relations
within
the
society
as
a
whole
no
doubt
result
from
this
namely
the
institution
of
as
an
intermediary
and
the
inequality
in
the
distribution
of
the
product
all
these
consequences
do
not
affect
the
movements
of
national
production
and
the
shaping
of
the
national
product
which
are
always
the
same
now
as
ever
under
the
rule
of
communism
no
more
than
they
alter
in
any
respect
as
far
as
the
point
of
is
concerned
the
contrast
between
capital
and
income
so
far
established
sismondi
had
laboured
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
as
had
smith
and
many
others
to
disentangle
the
concepts
of
capital
and
income
from
the
contradictions
of
capitalist
production
rodbertus
has
a
simpler
method
and
abstracts
from
the
specific
forms
determined
by
capitalist
production
for
society
as
a
whole
he
simply
calls
the
means
of
production
and
the
article
of
consumption
and
leaves
it
at
that
essential
influence
of
ownership
in
land
and
capital
applies
only
to
individuals
having
traffic
with
one
another
if
the
nation
is
taken
as
a
unit
the
effects
of
such
ownership
upon
the
individuals
completely
disappear
we
see
that
as
soon
as
rodbertus
comes
up
against
the
real
problem
the
capitalist
aggregate
product
and
its
movements
he
exhibits
the
utopian
characteristic
obtuseness
in
respect
of
the
historical
peculiarities
of
production
marx
comment
on
proudhon
that
of
society
as
a
whole
he
pretends
that
this
society
is
no
longer
capitalist
therefore
fits
him
like
a
glove
the
case
of
rodbertus
again
exemplifies
how
every
economist
before
marx
had
been
at
a
loss
when
it
came
to
harmonising
the
concrete
aspects
of
the
labour
process
with
the
perspective
of
capitalist
production
which
regards
everything
in
terms
of
value
to
mediating
between
the
forms
of
movement
performed
by
individual
capitals
and
the
movement
of
social
capital
such
efforts
as
a
rule
vacillate
from
one
extreme
to
another
the
shallow
approach
of
say
and
macculloch
recognising
only
the
conceptions
of
individual
capital
and
the
utopian
approach
of
proudhon
and
rodbertus
who
recognise
only
those
of
the
process
of
labour
that
is
the
context
in
which
marx
penetration
appears
in
its
true
light
his
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
illuminates
the
entire
problem
by
gathering
up
all
these
perspectives
in
their
harmony
and
their
contradictions
and
so
resolves
the
hopeless
obscurities
of
innumerable
tomes
into
two
rows
of
figures
of
striking
simplicity
on
the
strength
of
such
views
on
capital
and
income
as
these
capitalist
appropriation
is
clearly
quite
impossible
to
understand
indeed
rodbertus
simply
brands
it
as
and
indicts
it
before
the
forum
of
the
rights
of
property
it
so
blatantly
violates
personal
freedom
of
the
workers
which
ought
legally
to
involve
ownership
in
the
value
of
the
labour
product
leads
in
practice
to
their
renunciation
of
the
proprietary
claims
extorted
under
pressure
of
ownership
in
land
and
capital
but
the
owners
do
not
admit
to
this
great
and
universal
wrong
almost
as
though
they
were
instinctively
afraid
that
history
might
follow
its
own
stern
and
inexorable
logic
rodbertus
in
all
its
details
is
therefore
conclusive
proof
that
those
who
praise
relations
of
ownership
without
being
able
at
the
same
time
to
ground
ownership
in
anything
but
labour
completely
contradict
their
own
principle
it
proves
that
the
property
relations
of
are
in
fact
founded
on
a
universal
violation
of
this
principle
that
the
great
individual
fortunes
being
amassed
in
society
nowadays
are
the
result
of
cumulative
robbery
mounting
up
in
society
with
every
worker
since
time
immemorial
since
surplus
value
is
thus
branded
as
an
increasing
rate
of
surplus
value
must
appear
a
strange
error
of
economic
organisation
brissot
crude
paradox
with
its
revolutionary
ring
is
theft
had
been
the
starting
point
for
first
pamphlet
but
rodbertus
thesis
is
quite
another
matter
arguing
that
capital
is
theft
perpetrated
on
property
it
need
only
be
set
side
by
side
with
marx
chapter
on
the
transformation
of
the
laws
of
ownership
into
the
laws
of
capitalist
appropriation
this
triumph
of
historical
dialectics
in
vol
i
of
marx
in
order
to
show
up
rodbertus
by
ranting
against
capitalist
appropriation
under
the
aspect
of
the
of
property
rodbertus
closed
his
mind
to
capital
as
the
source
of
surplus
value
just
as
effectively
as
he
had
previously
been
prevented
by
his
tirades
against
from
seeing
the
surplus
value
as
a
source
of
capital
he
is
thus
in
an
even
worse
position
than
kirchmann
lacking
all
qualifications
for
understanding
capitalist
accumulation
what
it
amounts
to
is
that
rodbertus
wants
unrestricted
expansion
of
production
without
saving
that
is
to
say
without
capitalist
accumulation
he
wants
an
unlimited
growth
of
the
productive
forces
and
at
the
same
time
a
rate
of
surplus
value
stabilised
by
an
act
of
law
in
short
he
shows
himself
quite
unable
to
grasp
the
real
foundations
of
capitalist
production
he
wishes
to
reform
and
to
understand
the
most
important
results
of
the
classical
economics
he
criticises
so
adversely
it
is
no
more
than
to
be
expected
therefore
that
diehl
should
declare
rodbertus
a
pioneer
of
economic
theory
on
the
strength
of
his
theory
of
income
and
of
the
distinction
between
the
logical
and
the
historical
categories
of
capital
capital
properly
in
contrast
to
individual
capital
that
adolf
wagner
should
call
him
the
of
economic
socialism
proving
himself
ignorant
at
once
of
ricardo
rodbertus
and
socialism
alike
lexis
even
judges
that
rodbertus
is
at
least
the
equal
of
british
rival
in
power
of
abstract
thinking
and
by
far
his
superior
in
to
lay
bare
the
phenomena
in
their
ultimate
connections
in
vitality
and
above
all
in
his
approach
to
economic
life
rodbertus
real
achievements
in
economic
theory
however
other
than
his
critique
of
ricardo
ground
rent
his
at
times
quite
distinction
between
surplus
value
and
profit
his
treatment
of
the
surplus
value
as
a
whole
in
deliberate
contrast
with
its
partial
manifestations
his
critique
of
smith
dogma
concerning
the
analysis
of
commodities
in
terms
of
value
his
precise
formulation
of
the
periodical
character
of
the
crises
and
his
analysis
of
their
manifestations
all
these
attempts
to
carry
the
investigation
beyond
smith
ricardo
and
say
promising
as
such
though
doomed
to
failure
because
of
the
confused
basic
concepts
are
rather
above
the
heads
of
rodbertus
official
admirers
as
franz
mehring
already
pointed
out
it
was
rodbertus
strange
fortune
to
be
lauded
to
heaven
for
his
alleged
prowess
in
economics
by
the
same
people
who
called
him
to
task
for
his
real
merits
in
politics
this
contrast
between
economic
and
political
achievements
however
does
not
concern
us
here
in
the
realm
of
economic
theory
his
admirers
built
him
a
grand
memorial
on
the
barren
field
he
had
dug
with
the
hopeless
zeal
of
the
visionary
while
the
modest
beds
where
he
had
sown
a
few
fertile
seeds
were
allowed
to
be
smothered
with
weeds
and
forgotten
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
problem
of
accumulation
had
on
the
whole
been
much
advanced
beyond
the
first
controversy
by
this
treatment
if
in
the
interim
the
economic
theory
of
harmony
had
dropped
from
the
level
of
ricardo
to
that
of
a
social
criticism
had
correspondingly
declined
from
sismondi
to
rodbertus
sismondi
critique
of
had
been
an
historical
event
but
ideas
of
reform
even
on
their
first
appearance
were
a
miserable
regression
still
more
so
on
their
subsequent
reiteration
in
the
controversy
between
sismondi
on
the
one
hand
and
say
and
ricardo
on
the
other
one
party
proved
that
accumulation
was
impossible
because
of
the
crises
and
therefore
warned
against
full
development
of
the
productive
forces
the
other
party
proved
that
crises
were
impossible
and
advocated
an
unlimited
development
of
accumulation
though
all
argued
from
wrong
premises
each
was
logically
consistent
kirchmann
and
rodbertus
both
started
were
bound
to
start
from
the
fact
of
crises
here
the
problem
of
enlarged
reproduction
of
aggregate
capital
the
problem
of
accumulation
was
completely
identified
with
the
problem
of
crises
and
in
an
attempt
to
find
a
remedy
for
the
crises
although
the
historical
experience
of
fifty
years
had
shown
all
too
clearly
that
crises
as
witnessed
by
their
periodical
recurrence
are
a
necessary
phase
in
capitalist
reproduction
one
side
now
sees
the
remedy
in
the
complete
consumption
of
the
surplus
value
by
the
capitalist
that
is
to
say
in
refraining
from
accumulation
the
other
in
stabilisation
of
the
rate
of
surplus
value
by
legislative
measures
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
renouncing
accumulation
altogether
this
special
fad
of
rodbertus
sprang
from
his
fervent
and
explicit
belief
in
an

rodbertus
reiterates
during
a
lifetime
the
ideas
he
had
evolved
as
early
as
in
his
the
understanding
of
our
present
conditions
we
have
however
gone
so
far
as
to
consider
not
only
the
wage
of
labour
part
of
the
costs
of
the
goods
but
also
rents
and
capital
profits
we
must
therefore
refute
this
opinion
in
detail
it
has
a
twofold
foundation
a
wrong
conception
of
capital
which
counts
the
wage
of
labour
as
part
of
the
capital
just
like
materials
and
tools
while
it
is
on
the
same
level
as
rent
and
profit
a
confusion
of
the
costs
of
the
commodity
and
the
advances
of
the
entrepreneur
or
the
costs
of
the
enterprise
the
understanding
of
our

vol

just
so
already
in
the
understanding
of
our
must
distinguish
between
capital
in
its
narrow
or
proper
sense
and
the
fund
of
enterprise
or
capital
in
a
wider
sense
the
former
comprises
the
actual
reserves
in
tools
and
materials
the
latter
the
fund
necessary
for
running
an
enterprise
under
present
conditions
of
division
of
labour
the
former
is
capital
absolutely
necessary
to
production
and
the
latter
achieves
such
relative
necessity
only
by
force
of
present
conditions
hence
only
the
former
is
capital
in
the
strict
and
proper
meaning
of
the
term
this
alone
is
completely
congruent
with
the
concept
of
national
capital

of

two
earlier
ones
the
time
now
is
the
period
from
the
beginning
of
the
eighties
to
the
middle
of
the
nineties
the
scene
russia
in
western
europe
capitalism
had
already
attained
maturity
the
classical
view
of
smith
and
ricardo
in
a
budding
bourgeois
economy
had
long
since
vanished
the
optimism
of
the
vulgarian
manchester
doctrine
of
harmony
had
been
silenced
by
the
devastating
impact
of
the
world
collapse
in
the
seventies
and
under
the
heavy
blows
of
a
violent
class
struggle
that
blazed
up
in
all
capitalist
countries
after
the
sixties
even
that
harmony
patched
up
with
social
reformism
which
had
its
after
the
early
eighties
especially
in
germany
soon
ended
in
a
hangover
the
trial
of
twelve
years
special
legislation
against
the
social
democratic
party
had
brought
about
bitter
disillusionment
and
ultimately
destroyed
all
the
veils
of
harmony
revealing
the
cruel
capitalist
contradictions
in
their
naked
reality
since
then
optimism
had
only
been
possible
in
the
camp
of
the
rising
working
class
and
its
theorists
this
was
admittedly
not
optimism
about
a
natural
or
artificially
established
equilibrium
of
capitalist
economy
or
about
the
eternal
duration
of
capitalism
but
rather
the
conviction
that
capitalism
by
mightily
furthering
the
development
of
the
productive
forces
and
in
virtue
of
its
inherent
contradictions
would
provide
an
excellent
soil
for
the
historical
progress
of
society
towards
new
economic
and
social
forms
the
negative
depressing
tendency
of
the
first
stage
of
capitalism
at
one
time
realised
by
sismondi
alone
and
still
observed
by
rodbertus
as
late
as
the
forties
and
fifties
is
compensated
by
a
tendency
towards
elation
the
hopeful
and
victorious
striving
of
the
workers
for
ascendancy
in
their
movement
and
by
political
action
such
was
the
setting
in
western
europe
in
the
russia
of
that
time
however
the
picture
was
different
indeed
here
the
seventies
and
eighties
represent
in
every
respect
a
period
of
transition
a
period
of
internal
crises
with
all
its
agonies
big
industry
only
now
staged
its
real
entry
fostered
by
the
period
of
high
protective
tariffs
in
particular
the
introduction
of
a
tariff
on
gold
at
the
western
frontier
in
was
a
special
landmark
in
the
absolutist
government
new
policy
of
forcing
the
growth
of
capitalism
accumulation
of
capital
flourished
splendidly
in
russia
encouraged
by
all
kinds
of
state
subsidies
guarantees
premiums
and
government
orders
it
earned
profits
which
would
already
seem
legendary
to
the
west
yet
the
picture
of
internal
conditions
in
contemporary
russia
was
anything
but
attractive
and
auspicious
on
the
plains
the
decline
and
disintegration
of
rural
economy
under
the
pressure
of
exploitation
by
the
exchequer
and
the
monetary
system
caused
terrible
conditions
periodical
famines
and
peasant
risings
in
the
towns
again
the
factory
proletariat
had
not
yet
been
consolidated
either
socially
or
mentally
into
a
modern
working
class
for
the
greater
part
it
was
still
closely
connected
with
agriculture
and
remained
particularly
in
the
large
industrial
parts
of
the
most
important
centre
of
the
russian
textile
industry
accordingly
primitive
forms
of
exploitation
were
countered
by
primitive
measures
of
defence
not
until
the
early
eighties
did
the
spontaneous
factory
revolts
in
the
moscow
district
with
their
smashing
up
of
machines
provide
the
impetus
for
the
first
rudiments
of
factory
legislation
in
the
czarist
empire
if
the
economic
aspect
of
russian
public
life
showed
at
every
step
the
harsh
discords
of
a
period
of
transition
there
was
a
corresponding
crisis
in
intellectual
life
the
indigenous
brand
of
russian
socialism
theoretically
grounded
in
the
peculiarities
of
the
russian
agrarian
constitution
was
politically
finished
with
the
failure
of
the
terrorist
party
of
volya
its
extreme
revolutionary
exponent
the
first
writings
of
george
plekhanov
on
the
other
hand
which
were
to
pave
the
way
in
russia
for
marxist
trains
of
thought
had
only
been
published
in
and
and
for
about
a
decade
they
seemed
to
have
little
influence
during
the
eighties
and
up
to
the
nineties
the
mental
life
of
the
russian
and
in
particular
of
the
socialist
intelligentsia
with
their
tendency
towards
opposition
was
dominated
by
a
peculiar
mixture
of
remnants
and
random
elements
of
theoretical
marxism
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
this
mixture
was
scepticism
as
to
the
possibility
of
capitalist
development
in
russia
at
an
early
date
the
russian
intelligentsia
had
been
preoccupied
with
the
question
whether
russia
should
follow
the
example
of
western
europe
and
embark
on
capitalist
development
at
first
they
noticed
only
the
bleak
aspects
of
capitalism
in
the
west
its
disintegrating
effects
upon
the
traditional
patriarchal
forms
of
production
and
upon
the
prosperity
and
assured
livelihood
for
the
broad
masses
of
the
population
as
against
that
the
russian
rural
communal
ownership
in
land
the
famous
seemed
to
offer
a
to
the
blessed
land
of
socialism
a
lead
direct
to
a
higher
social
development
of
russia
without
the
capitalist
phase
and
its
attendant
misery
as
experienced
in
western
europe
would
it
be
right
to
fling
away
this
fortunate
and
exceptional
position
this
unique
historical
opportunity
and
forcibly
transplant
capitalist
production
to
russia
with
the
help
of
the
state
would
it
be
right
to
destroy
the
system
of
rural
holdings
and
production
and
open
the
doors
wide
to
proletarisation
to
misery
and
insecurity
of
existence
for
the
toiling
masses
the
russian
intelligentsia
was
preoccupied
with
this
fundamental
problem
ever
since
the
agrarian
reform
and
even
earlier
since
hertzen
and
especially
since
chernishevski
this
was
the
wholly
unique
world
view
of
in
a
nutshell
an
enormous
literature
was
created
in
russia
by
this
intellectual
tendency
ranging
from
the
avowedly
reactionary
doctrines
of
the
slavophiles
to
the
revolutionary
theory
of
the
terrorist
party
on
the
one
hand
it
encouraged
the
collection
of
vast
material
by
separate
inquiries
into
the
economic
forms
of
russian
life
into
production
and
its
singular
aspects
into
agriculture
as
practised
by
the
peasant
communes
into
the
domestic
industries
of
the
peasants
the
and
also
into
the
mental
life
of
the
peasants
the
sects
and
similar
phenomena
on
the
other
hand
a
peculiar
type
of
sprang
up
as
the
artistic
reflection
of
the
contradictory
social
conditions
the
struggle
between
old
and
new
ways
which
beset
the
mind
at
every
step
with
difficult
problems
finally
in
the
seventies
and
eighties
a
peculiarly
stuffy
philosophy
of
history
sprang
up
from
the
same
root
and
found
its
champions
in
peter
lavrov
nicolai
mikhailovski
professor
kareyev
and
vorontsov
it
was
the
method
in
sociology
which
declared
thought
to
be
the
decisive
factor
in
social
development
or
which
more
precisely
sought
to
make
a
intelligentsia
the
agent
of
historical
progress
here
we
are
interested
only
in
one
aspect
of
this
wide
field
with
its
many
ramifications
the
struggle
of
opinions
regarding
the
chances
of
capitalist
development
and
even
then
only
in
so
far
as
these
were
based
upon
general
reflections
on
the
social
conditions
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
since
these
latter
were
also
to
play
a
big
part
in
the
russian
controversial
literature
of
the
eighties
and
nineties
the
point
at
issue
was
to
begin
with
russian
capitalism
and
its
prospects
but
this
of
course
led
further
afield
to
the
whole
problem
of
capitalist
development
the
example
and
the
experiences
of
the
west
were
adduced
as
vital
evidence
in
this
debate
one
fact
was
of
decisive
importance
for
the
theoretical
content
of
the
discussion
that
followed
not
only
was
marx
analysis
of
capitalist
production
as
laid
down
in
the
first
volume
of
already
common
property
of
educated
russia
but
the
second
volume
too
with
its
analysis
of
the
reproduction
of
capital
as
a
whole
had
already
been
published
in
this
gave
a
fundamentally
new
twist
to
the
discussion
no
more
did
the
problem
of
crises
obscure
the
real
crux
of
the
problem
for
the
first
time
the
argument
centred
purely
in
the
reproduction
of
capital
as
a
whole
in
accumulation
nor
was
the
analysis
bogged
any
longer
by
an
aimless
fumbling
for
the
concepts
of
income
and
of
individual
and
aggregate
capital
marx
diagram
of
social
reproduction
had
provided
a
firm
foothold
finally
the
issue
was
no
longer
between
and
social
reform
but
between
two
varieties
of
socialism
the
and
somewhat
muddled
brand
of
russian
socialists
stood
for
scepticism
regarding
the
possibility
of
capitalist
development
much
in
the
spirit
of
sismondi
and
in
part
of
rodbertus
though
they
themselves
frequently
cited
marx
as
their
authority
optimism
on
the
other
hand
was
represented
by
the
marxist
school
in
russia
thus
the
setting
of
the
stage
had
been
shifted
completely
one
of
the
two
champions
of
the
movement
vorontsov
known
in
russia
mainly
under
the
de
his
initials
was
an
odd
customer
his
economics
were
completely
muddled
and
as
an
expert
on
theory
he
can
not
be
taken
seriously
at
all
the
other
nikolayon
danielson
however
was
a
man
of
wide
education
and
thoroughly
conversant
with
marxism
he
had
edited
the
russian
translation
of
the
first
volume
of
and
was
a
personal
friend
of
marx
and
engels
with
both
of
whom
he
kept
up
a
lively
correspondence
published
in
the
russian
language
in
nevertheless
it
was
vorontsov
who
influenced
public
opinion
among
the
russian
intelligentsia
in
the
eighties
and
marxists
in
russia
had
to
fight
him
above
all
as
for
our
problem
the
general
prospects
of
capitalist
development
a
new
generation
of
russian
marxists
who
had
learned
from
the
historical
experience
and
knowledge
of
western
europe
joined
forces
with
george
plekhanov
in
opposition
to
the
two
representatives
of
scepticism
in
the
nineties
they
were
amongst
others
professor
kablukov
professor
manuilov
professor
issayev
professor
skvortsov
vladimir
ilyin
peter
struve
bulgakov
and
professor
tugan
baranovski
in
the
further
course
of
our
investigation
we
shall
however
confine
ourselves
to
the
last
three
of
these
since
every
one
of
them
furnished
a
more
or
less
finished
critique
of
this
theory
on
the
point
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
this
battle
of
wits
brilliant
in
parts
which
kept
the
socialist
intelligentsia
spellbound
in
the
nineties
and
was
only
brought
to
an
end
by
the
walkover
of
the
marxist
school
officially
inaugurated
the
infiltration
into
russian
thought
of
marxism
as
an
theory
marxism
at
that
time
publicly
took
possession
of
the
universities
the
reviews
and
the
economic
book
market
in
russia
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
position
ten
years
later
when
the
revolutionary
risings
of
the
proletariat
demonstrated
in
the
streets
the
darker
side
of
this
optimism
about
capitalist
development
none
of
this
pleïad
of
marxist
optimists
with
but
a
single
exception
was
to
be
found
in
the
camp
of
the
proletariat
vorontsov
and
his
the
representatives
of
russian
were
convinced
that
capitalism
had
no
future
in
russia
and
this
conviction
brought
them
to
the
problem
of
capitalist
reproduction
laid
down
his
theories
on
this
point
in
a
series
of
articles
in
the
review
and
in
other
periodicals
which
were
collected
and
published
in
under
the
title
destiny
of
capitalism
in
he
further
dealt
with
the
problem
in
commodity
surplus
in
the
supply
of
the
market
and
capitalism
and
finally
in
of
economic
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
vorontsov
attitude
towards
capitalist
development
in
russia
he
sided
neither
with
the
purely
slavophil
theory
which
deduced
the
perversity
and
perniciousness
of
capitalism
for
russia
from
the
of
the
russian
economic
structure
and
a
specifically
russian
character
nor
with
the
marxists
who
saw
in
capitalist
development
an
unavoidable
historical
stage
which
is
needed
to
clear
the
way
towards
social
progress
for
russian
society
too
vorontsov
for
his
part
simply
asserts
that
denunciation
and
acclamation
of
capitalism
are
equally
futile
because
having
no
roots
in
russia
capitalism
is
just
impossible
there
and
can
have
no
future
the
essential
conditions
of
capitalist
development
are
lacking
in
russia
and
love
labour
lost
if
the
state
tries
to
promote
it
artificially
one
might
as
well
spare
these
efforts
together
with
the
heavy
sacrifices
they
entail
but
if
we
look
into
the
matter
more
closely
vorontsov
thesis
is
not
nearly
so
uncompromising
for
if
we
pay
attention
to
the
fact
that
capitalism
does
not
mean
only
the
accumulation
of
capital
wealth
but
also
that
the
small
producer
is
reduced
to
the
proletarian
level
that
the
labourer
livelihood
is
not
assured
and
that
there
are
periodical
crises
then
vorontsov
would
by
no
means
deny
that
all
these
phenomena
exist
in
russia
on
the
contrary
he
explicitly
says
in
his
preface
to
destiny
of
capitalism
in
i
dispute
the
possibility
of
capitalism
as
a
form
of
production
in
russia
i
do
not
intend
to
commit
myself
in
any
way
as
to
its
future
as
a
form
or
degree
of
exploiting
the
national
resources
vorontsov
consequently
is
of
the
opinion
that
capitalism
in
russia
merely
can
not
attain
the
same
degree
of
maturity
as
in
the
west
whereas
the
severance
of
the
immediate
producer
from
the
means
of
production
might
well
be
expected
under
russian
conditions
vorontsov
goes
even
further
he
does
not
dispute
at
all
that
a
development
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
is
quite
possible
in
various
branches
of
production
and
even
allows
for
capitalist
exports
from
russia
to
foreign
markets
indeed
he
says
in
his
essay
on
commodity
surplus
in
the
supply
of
the
market
that
several
branches
of
industry
capitalist
production
develops
very
quickly
in
the
russian
meaning
of
the
term
of
course
is
most
probable
that
russia
just
like
any
other
country
enjoys
certain
natural
advantages
which
enable
her
to
act
as
a
supplier
of
certain
kinds
of
commodities
on
foreign
markets
it
is
extremely
possible
that
capital
can
profit
by
this
fact
and
lay
hands
upon
the
branches
of
production
concerned
that
is
to
say
the
inter
national
division
of
labour
will
make
it
easy
for
our
capitalists
to
gain
a
foothold
in
certain
branches
this
however
is
not
the
point
we
do
not
speak
of
a
merely
incidental
participation
of
capital
in
the
industrial
organisation
of
the
country
but
ask
whether
it
is
likely
that
the
entire
production
of
russia
can
be
put
on
a
capitalist
basis
put
in
this
form
vorontsov
scepticism
looks
quite
different
from
what
might
have
been
expected
at
first
he
doubts
whether
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
could
ever
gain
possession
of
the
entire
production
in
russia
but
then
capitalism
has
not
so
far
accomplished
this
feat
in
any
country
of
the
world
not
even
in
england
such
a
brand
of
scepticism
as
to
the
future
of
capitalism
appears
at
a
glance
quite
international
in
outlook
and
indeed
vorontsov
theory
here
amounts
to
a
quite
general
reflection
on
the
nature
and
the
essential
conditions
of
capitalism
it
is
based
upon
a
general
theoretical
approach
to
the
reproductive
process
of
social
capital
as
a
whole
vorontsov
gives
the
following
very
clear
formulation
of
the
specific
relations
between
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
and
the
problem
of
markets
inter
national
division
of
labour
the
distribution
of
all
branches
of
industry
among
the
countries
taking
part
in
international
commerce
is
quite
independent
of
capitalism
market
which
thus
comes
into
being
the
demand
for
the
products
of
different
countries
resulting
from
such
a
division
of
labour
among
the
nations
has
intrinsically
nothing
in
common
with
the
market
required
by
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
the
products
of
capitalist
industry
come
on
the
market
for
another
purpose
the
question
whether
all
the
needs
of
the
country
are
satisfied
is
irrelevant
to
them
and
the
entrepreneur
does
not
necessarily
receive
in
their
stead
another
material
product
which
may
be
consumed
their
main
purpose
is
to
realise
the
surplus
value
they
contain
what
then
is
this
surplus
value
that
it
should
interest
the
capitalist
for
its
own
sake
from
our
point
of
view
it
is
the
surplus
of
production
over
consumption
inside
the
country
every
worker
produces
more
than
he
himself
can
consume
and
all
these
surplus
items
accumulate
in
a
few
hands
their
owners
themselves
consume
them
exchanging
them
for
the
purpose
against
the
most
variegated
kinds
of
necessities
and
luxuries
yet
eat
drink
and
dance
as
much
as
they
like
they
will
not
be
able
to
squander
the
whole
of
the
surplus
value
a
considerable
remnant
will
be
left
over
of
which
they
have
to
dispose
somehow
even
though
they
can
not
exchange
it
for
other
products
they
must
convert
it
into
money
since
it
would
otherwise
just
go
bad
since
there
is
no
one
inside
the
country
on
whom
the
capitalists
could
foist
this
remnant
it
must
be
exported
abroad
and
that
is
why
foreign
markets
are
indispensable
to
countries
embarking
on
the
capitalist
venture
the
above
is
a
literal
translation
showing
all
the
peculiarities
of
vorontsov
diction
so
that
the
reader
may
have
a
taste
of
this
brilliant
russian
theorist
with
whom
one
can
spend
moments
of
sheer
delight
later
in
vorontsov
summarised
the
same
views
in
his
book
of
economic
now
claiming
our
attention
here
he
takes
a
stand
against
the
views
of
say
and
ricardo
and
in
particular
also
against
john
stuart
mill
who
denied
the
possibility
of
general
in
the
course
of
his
argument
he
discovers
something
no
one
had
known
before
he
has
laid
bare
the
source
of
all
errors
the
classical
school
made
about
the
problem
of
crises
this
mistake
lies
in
a
fallacious
theory
of
the
costs
of
production
to
which
bourgeois
economists
are
addicted
no
doubt
from
the
aspect
of
the
costs
of
production
which
according
to
vorontsov
equally
assumption
do
not
comprise
profits
both
profit
and
crises
are
unthinkable
and
inexplicable
but
we
can
only
appreciate
this
original
thought
to
the
full
in
the
author
own
words
to
the
doctrine
of
bourgeois
economists
the
value
of
a
product
is
determined
by
the
labour
employed
in
its
manufacture
yet
bourgeois
economists
once
they
have
given
this
determination
of
value
immediately
forget
it
and
base
their
subsequent
explanation
of
the
exchange
phenomena
upon
a
different
theory
which
substitutes
costs
of
production
for
labour
thus
two
products
are
mutually
exchanged
in
such
quantities
that
the
costs
of
production
are
equal
on
both
sides
such
a
view
of
the
process
of
exchange
indeed
leaves
no
room
for
a
commodity
surplus
inside
the
country
any
product
of
a
worker
annual
labour
must
from
this
point
of
view
represent
a
certain
quantity
of
material
of
which
it
is
made
of
tools
which
have
been
used
in
its
manufacture
and
of
the
products
which
served
to
maintain
the
workers
during
the
period
of
production
it
presumably
the
product
appears
on
the
market
in
order
to
change
its
to
reconvert
itself
into
objects
into
products
for
the
workers
and
the
value
necessary
for
renewing
the
tools
as
soon
as
it
is
split
up
into
its
component
parts
the
process
of
reassembling
the
productive
process
will
begin
in
the
course
of
which
all
the
values
listed
above
will
be
consumed
in
their
stead
a
new
product
will
come
into
being
which
is
the
connecting
link
between
past
and
future
consumption
from
this
perfectly
unique
attempt
to
demonstrate
social
reproduction
as
a
continuous
process
in
the
light
of
the
costs
of
production
the
following
conclusion
is
promptly
drawn
considering
thus
the
aggregate
bulk
of
a
country
products
we
shall
find
no
commodity
surplus
at
all
over
and
above
the
demand
of
society
an
unmarketable
surplus
is
therefore
impossible
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
bourgeois
economic
theory
of
value
yet
after
having
eliminated
capitalist
profit
from
the
costs
of
production
by
an
extremely
autocratic
manhandling
of
the
bourgeois
theory
of
value
vorontsov
immediately
presents
this
deficiency
as
a
great
discovery
above
analysis
however
reveals
yet
another
feature
in
the
theory
of
value
prevalent
of
late
it
becomes
evident
that
this
theory
leaves
no
room
for
capitalist
profits
the
argument
that
follows
is
striking
in
its
brevity
and
simplicity
if
i
exchange
my
own
product
representing
a
cost
of
production
of
roubles
for
another
product
of
equal
value
i
receive
only
so
much
as
will
be
sufficient
to
cover
my
expense
but
for
my
abstinence
literally
so
i
shall
get
nothing
and
now
vorontsov
really
comes
to
grips
with
the
root
of
the
problem
it
is
proved
on
a
strictly
logical
development
of
the
ideas
held
by
bourgeois
economists
that
the
destiny
of
the
commodity
surplus
on
the
market
and
that
of
capitalist
profit
is
identical
this
circumstance
justifies
the
conclusion
that
both
phenomena
are
interdependent
that
the
existence
of
one
is
a
condition
of
the
other
and
indeed
so
long
as
there
is
no
profit
there
is
no
commodity
surplus
it
is
different
if
the
profit
comes
into
being
inside
the
country
such
profit
is
not
originally
related
to
production
it
is
a
phenomenon
which
is
connected
with
the
latter
not
by
technical
and
natural
conditions
but
by
an
extraneous
social
form
production
requires
for
its
continuation
only
material
tools
and
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
therefore
as
such
it
consumes
only
the
corresponding
part
of
the
products
other
consumers
must
be
found
for
the
surplus
which
makes
up
the
profit
and
for
which
there
is
no
room
in
the
permanent
structure
of
industrial
life
in
production
consumers
namely
who
are
not
organically
connected
with
production
who
are
fortuitous
to
a
certain
extent
the
necessary
number
of
such
consumers
may
or
may
not
be
forthcoming
and
in
the
latter
case
there
will
be
a
commodity
surplus
on
the
market
well
content
with
the
enlightenment
by
which
he
has
turned
the
surplus
product
into
an
invention
of
capital
and
the
capitalist
into
a
consumer
who
is
organically
connected
with
capitalist
production
vorontsov
now
turns
to
the
crises
on
the
basis
of
theory
of
the
value
of
labour
which
he
claims
to
in
his
later
works
he
expounds
them
as
an
immediate
result
of
the
surplus
value
as
follows
the
working
part
of
the
population
consumes
what
enters
into
the
costs
of
production
in
form
of
the
wages
for
labour
the
capitalists
themselves
must
destroy
literally
so
the
surplus
value
excepting
that
part
of
it
which
the
market
requires
for
expansion
if
the
capitalists
are
in
a
position
to
do
so
and
act
accordingly
there
can
be
no
commodity
surplus
if
not
industrial
crises
displacement
of
the
workers
from
the
factories
and
other
evils
will
result
according
to
vorontsov
however
it
is
inadequate
elasticity
of
the
human
which
can
not
enlarge
its
capacity
to
consume
as
rapidly
as
the
surplus
value
is
increasing
which
is
in
the
end
responsible
for
these
evils
he
repeatedly
expresses
this
ingenious
thought
as
follows
achilles
heel
of
capitalist
industrial
organisation
thus
lies
in
the
incapacity
of
the
entrepreneurs
to
consume
the
whole
of
their
income
having
thus
marx
version
of
ricardo
theory
of
value
vorontsov
arrives
at
sismondi
theory
of
crises
which
he
adopts
in
as
crude
and
simplified
a
form
as
possible
he
believes
of
course
that
he
is
adopting
the
views
of
rodbertus
in
reproducing
those
of
sismondi
inductive
method
of
research
he
declares
triumphantly
resulted
in
the
very
same
theory
of
crises
and
of
pauperism
which
had
been
objectively
stated
by
rodbertus
it
is
not
quite
clear
what
vorontsov
means
by
an
method
of
research
which
he
contrasts
with
the
objective
method
since
all
things
are
possible
to
vorontsov
he
may
conceivably
mean
marx
theory
yet
rodbertus
too
was
not
to
emerge
unimproved
from
the
hands
of
the
original
russian
thinker
vorontsov
corrects
rodbertus
theory
merely
in
so
far
as
he
eliminates
the
stabilisation
of
the
wage
rate
in
accordance
with
the
value
of
the
aggregate
product
which
to
rodbertus
had
been
the
pivot
of
his
whole
system
according
to
vorontsov
this
measure
against
crises
is
a
mere
palliative
since
immediate
cause
of
the
above
phenomena
unemployment
etc
is
not
that
the
working
classes
receive
too
small
a
share
of
the
national
income
but
that
the
capitalist
class
can
not
possibly
consume
all
the
products
which
every
year
fall
to
their
share
yet
as
soon
as
he
has
refuted
rodbertus
reform
of
the
distribution
of
incomes
vorontsov
with
that
logical
consistency
so
peculiar
to
him
ultimately
arrives
at
the
following
forecast
for
the
future
destiny
of
capitalism
industrial
organisation
which
prevails
in
europe
is
to
prosper
and
flourish
further
still
it
can
only
do
so
provided
that
some
means
will
be
found
to
destroy
that
portion
of
the
national
income
which
falls
to
the
share
over
and
above
their
capacity
to
consume
the
simplest
solution
of
this
problem
will
be
an
appropriate
change
in
the
distribution
of
the
aggregate
income
among
those
who
take
part
in
production
if
the
entrepreneurs
would
retain
for
themselves
only
so
much
of
all
increase
of
the
national
income
as
they
need
to
satisfy
all
their
whims
and
fancies
leaving
the
remainder
to
the
working
class
the
mass
of
the
people
then
the
régime
of
capitalism
would
be
assured
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
hash
of
ricardo
marx
sismondi
and
rodbertus
thus
is
topped
with
the
discovery
that
capitalist
production
could
be
radically
cured
of
that
it
could
and
flourish
in
all
eternity
if
the
capitalists
would
refrain
from
capitalising
their
surplus
value
and
would
make
a
free
gift
to
the
working
class
of
the
corresponding
part
of
the
surplus
value
meanwhile
the
capitalists
until
they
have
become
sensible
enough
to
accept
vorontsov
good
advice
employ
other
means
for
the
annual
destruction
of
a
part
of
their
surplus
value
modern
militarism
amongst
others
is
one
of
these
appropriate
measures
and
this
precisely
to
the
extent
to
which
the
bills
of
militarism
are
footed
by
the
capitalists
income
for
vorontsov
can
be
counted
upon
to
turn
things
upside
down
and
not
by
the
working
masses
a
primary
remedy
for
capitalism
however
is
foreign
trade
which
again
is
a
sore
spot
in
russian
capitalism
as
the
last
to
arrive
at
the
table
of
the
world
market
russian
capitalism
fares
worst
in
the
competition
with
older
capitalist
countries
and
thus
lacks
both
prospects
as
to
foreign
markets
and
the
most
vital
conditions
of
existence
russia
remains
the
of
peasants
a
country
of
production
all
this
is
correct
vorontsov
concludes
his
essay
on
commodity
surplus
in
the
supply
of
the
market
capitalism
can
play
only
a
limited
part
in
russia
it
must
resign
from
the
direction
of
agriculture
and
its
development
in
the
industrial
sphere
must
not
inflict
too
many
injuries
upon
the
domestic
industries
which
under
our
economic
conditions
are
indispensable
to
the
welfare
of
the
majority
of
the
population
if
the
reader
would
comment
that
capitalism
might
not
accept
such
a
compromise
our
answer
will
be
so
much
the
worse
for
capitalism
thus
vorontsov
ultimately
washes
his
hands
of
the
whole
thing
declining
for
his
part
all
responsibility
for
the
further
fortunes
of
economic
development

russia

his
views
about
the
destiny
of
capitalism
in
russia
are
grounded
in
a
definite
theory
about
the
conditions
of
the
development
of
capitalist
production
in
general
and
it
is
this
with
which
we
must
now
deal
since
the
market
is
of
decisive
importance
for
the
capitalist
mode
of
economy
every
capitalist
nation
tries
to
make
sure
of
as
large
a
market
as
possible
in
the
first
place
of
course
it
relies
on
its
home
market
but
at
a
certain
level
of
development
the
home
market
is
no
longer
sufficient
for
a
capitalist
nation
and
this
for
the
following
reasons
all
that
social
labour
newly
produces
in
one
year
can
be
divided
into
two
parts
the
share
received
by
the
workers
in
the
form
of
wages
and
that
which
is
appropriated
by
the
capitalists
of
the
first
part
only
so
many
means
of
subsistence
as
correspond
in
value
to
the
sum
total
of
the
wages
paid
within
the
country
can
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
yet
capitalist
economy
decidedly
tends
to
depress
this
part
more
and
more
its
methods
are
a
longer
working
day
stepping
up
the
intensity
of
labour
and
increasing
output
by
technical
improvements
which
enable
the
substitution
of
female
and
juvenile
for
male
labour
and
in
some
cases
displace
adult
labour
altogether
even
if
the
wages
of
the
workers
still
employed
are
rising
such
increase
can
never
equal
the
savings
of
the
capitalists
resulting
from
these
changes
the
result
of
all
this
is
that
the
working
class
must
play
an
ever
smaller
part
as
buyers
on
the
home
market
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
further
change
capitalist
production
gradually
takes
over
even
the
trades
which
provided
additional
employment
to
an
agricultural
people
thus
it
deprives
the
peasants
of
their
resources
by
degrees
so
that
the
rural
population
can
afford
to
buy
fewer
and
fewer
industrial
products
this
is
a
further
reason
for
the
continual
contraction
of
the
home
market
as
for
the
capitalist
class
we
see
that
this
latter
is
also
unable
to
realise
the
entire
newly
created
product
though
for
the
opposite
reason
however
large
the
requirements
of
this
class
the
capitalists
will
not
be
able
to
consume
the
entire
surplus
product
in
person
first
because
part
of
it
is
needed
to
enlarge
production
for
technical
improvements
which
to
the
individual
entrepreneur
will
be
a
necessary
condition
of
existence
in
a
competitive
society
secondly
because
an
expanding
capitalist
production
implies
an
expansion
in
those
branches
of
industry
which
produce
means
of
production
the
mining
industry
the
machine
industry
and
so
forth
and
whose
products
from
the
very
beginning
take
a
that
is
incapable
of
personal
consumption
and
can
only
function
as
capital
thirdly
and
lastly
the
higher
labour
productivity
and
capital
savings
that
can
be
achieved
by
mass
production
of
cheap
commodities
increasingly
impel
society
towards
mass
production
of
commodities
which
can
not
all
be
consumed
by
a
mere
handful
of
capitalists
although
one
capitalist
can
realise
his
surplus
value
in
the
surplus
product
of
another
capitalist
and
this
is
only
true
for
products
of
a
certain
branch
for
consumer
goods
however
the
incentive
of
capitalist
production
is
not
the
satisfaction
of
personal
wants
and
this
is
further
shown
by
the
progressive
decline
in
the
production
of
consumer
as
compared
to
that
of
producer
goods
we
see
that
the
aggregate
product
of
a
capitalist
nation
must
greatly
exceed
the
requirements
of
the
whole
industrial
population
employed
in
the
same
way
as
each
individual
factory
produces
vastly
in
excess
of
the
requirements
of
both
its
workers
and
the
entrepreneur
and
this
is
entirely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
nation
is
a
capitalist
nation
because
the
distribution
of
resources
within
the
society
does
not
aim
to
satisfy
the
real
wants
of
the
population
but
only
the
effective
demand
just
as
an
individual
could
not
maintain
himself
as
a
capitalist
even
for
a
day
if
his
market
were
confined
to
the
requirements
of
his
workers
and
his
own
so
the
home
market
of
a
developed
capitalist
nation
must
also
be
insufficient
at
a
certain
level
capitalist
development
thus
has
the
tendency
to
impede
its
own
progress
these
obstacles
are
ultimately
due
to
the
fact
that
progressive
labour
productivity
involving
the
severance
of
the
immediate
producer
from
the
means
of
production
does
not
benefit
society
as
a
whole
but
only
the
individual
entrepreneur
and
the
mass
of
labour
power
and
which
has
been
free
by
this
process
becomes
redundant
and
thus
is
not
only
lost
to
society
but
will
become
a
burden
to
it
the
real
wants
of
the
masses
can
only
be
satisfied
more
fully
in
so
far
as
there
can
be
an
ascendancy
of
a
mode
of
production
based
upon
the
union
between
the
producer
and
his
means
of
production
it
is
the
aim
of
capitalism
however
to
gain
possession
of
just
these
spheres
of
production
and
to
destroy
in
the
process
the
main
factor
which
makes
for
its
own
prosperity
the
periodical
famines
in
india
for
instance
recurring
at
intervals
of
ten
or
eleven
years
were
thus
among
the
causes
of
periodical
industrial
crises
in
england
any
nation
that
sets
out
on
capitalist
development
will
sooner
or
later
come
up
against
these
contradictions
inherent
in
this
mode
of
production
and
the
later
a
nation
embarks
on
the
capitalist
venture
the
more
strongly
will
these
contradictions
make
themselves
felt
since
once
the
home
market
has
been
saturated
no
substitute
can
be
found
the
outside
market
having
already
been
conquered
by
the
older
competing
countries
the
upshot
of
it
all
is
that
the
limits
of
capitalism
are
set
by
the
increasing
poverty
born
of
its
own
development
by
the
increasing
number
of
redundant
workers
deficient
in
all
purchasing
power
increasing
labour
productivity
which
can
rapidly
satisfy
every
effective
demand
of
society
corresponds
to
the
increasing
incapacity
of
ever
broader
masses
of
the
population
to
satisfy
their
most
vital
needs
on
the
one
hand
a
glut
of
goods
that
can
not
be
sold
and
on
the
other
large
masses
who
lack
the
bare
necessities
these
are
nikolayon
general
views
he
knows
his
marx
we
see
and
has
turned
the
two
first
volumes
of
to
excellent
use
and
still
the
whole
trend
of
his
argument
is
genuinely
sismondian
it
is
capitalism
itself
which
brings
about
a
shrinking
home
market
since
it
impoverishes
the
masses
every
calamity
of
modern
society
is
due
to
the
destruction
of
the
mode
of
production
that
is
to
say
the
destruction
of
enterprise
that
is
his
main
theme
more
openly
even
than
sismondi
nikolayon
sets
the
tenor
of
his
critique
by
an
apotheosis
of
enterprise
this
sole
approach
to
grace
the
aggregate
capitalist
product
can
not
in
the
end
be
realised
within
the
society
this
can
only
be
done
with
recourse
to
outside
markets
nikolayon
here
comes
to
the
same
conclusion
as
vorontsov
in
spite
of
a
quite
different
theoretical
point
of
departure
applied
to
russia
it
is
the
economic
scientific
ground
for
a
sceptical
attitude
towards
capitalism
capitalist
development
in
russia
has
been
without
access
to
foreign
markets
from
the
first
it
could
only
show
its
worst
aspects
it
has
impoverished
the
masses
of
the
people
in
consequence
it
was
a
mistake
to
promote
capitalism
in
russia
on
this
point
nikolayon
fulminates
like
a
prophet
of
the
old
testament
of
keeping
to
the
tradition
of
centuries
instead
of
developing
our
old
inherited
principle
of
a
close
connection
between
the
immediate
producer
and
his
means
of
production
instead
of
usefully
applying
the
scientific
achievements
of
europe
to
their
forms
of
production
based
on
the
peasants
ownership
of
their
means
of
production
instead
of
increasing
their
productivity
by
concentrating
the
means
of
production
in
their
hands
instead
of
benefiting
not
by
the
forms
of
production
in
europe
but
by
its
organisation
its
powerful
its
division
of
labour
its
machinery
instead
of
developing
the
fundamental
principle
of
a
landowning
peasantry
and
applying
it
to
the
cultivation
of
the
land
by
the
peasants
instead
of
making
science
and
its
application
widely
accessible
to
the
peasants
instead
of
all
this
we
have
taken
the
opposite
turning
we
have
failed
to
prevent
the
development
of
capitalist
forms
of
production
although
they
are
based
on
the
expropriation
of
the
peasants
on
the
contrary
we
have
promoted
with
all
our
might
the
upsetting
of
our
entire
economic
life
which
resulted
in
the
famine
of
though
the
evil
is
much
advanced
it
is
not
too
late
even
now
to
retrace
our
steps
on
the
contrary
a
complete
reform
of
economic
policy
is
just
as
urgently
needed
for
russia
in
view
of
the
threatening
proletarisation
and
collapse
as
alexander
reforms
after
the
crimean
war
were
necessary
in
their
time
now
a
social
reform
as
advocated
by
nikolayon
is
completely
utopian
his
attitude
exhibits
an
even
more
blatant
and
reactionary
bias
than
sismondi
ever
did
considering
that
the
russian
writes
after
a
lapse
of
seventy
years
for
in
his
opinion
the
old
the
rural
community
founded
on
the
communal
ownership
of
the
soil
is
the
raft
to
deliver
russia
from
the
flood
of
capitalism
on
it
the
discoveries
of
modern
big
industry
and
scientific
technique
are
to
be
grafted
by
measures
which
remain
his
own
secret
so
that
it
can
serve
as
the
basis
of
a
higher
form
of
production
russia
can
choose
no
other
alternative
either
she
turns
her
back
upon
capitalist
development
or
she
must
resign
herself
to
death
and
decay
after
a
crushing
criticism
of
capitalism
nikolayon
thus
ends
up
with
the
same
old
panacea
which
had
as
early
as
the
fifties
though
at
that
time
with
greater
justification
been
hailed
as
the
russian
guarantee
of
a
higher
social
development
although
its
reactionary
character
as
a
lifeless
relic
of
ancient
institutions
had
been
exposed
in
engels
in
engels
wrote
at
the
time
further
development
of
russia
on
bourgeois
lines
would
gradually
destroy
communal
property
there
too
quite
apart
from
any
interference
of
the
russian
government
with
the
knout
and
with
bayonets
as
the
revolutionary
populists
imagined
under
the
pressure
of
taxes
and
usury
communal
landownership
is
no
longer
a
privilege
it
becomes
an
irksome
chain
the
peasants
frequently
run
away
from
it
either
with
or
without
their
families
to
seek
their
living
as
itinerant
labourers
and
leave
the
land
behind
we
see
that
communal
ownership
in
russia
has
long
since
passed
its
flower
and
there
is
every
indication
that
its
decay
is
approaching
with
these
words
engels
hits
right
on
the
target
of
the
problem
eighteen
years
before
the
publication
of
nikolayon
principal
work
if
nikolayon
subsequently
with
renewed
courage
again
conjured
up
the
ghost
of
the
it
was
a
bad
historical
anachronism
inasmuch
as
about
a
decade
later
the
was
given
an
official
burial
by
the
state
the
absolutist
government
which
had
for
financial
reasons
tried
during
half
a
century
artificially
to
keep
the
machinery
of
the
rural
community
going
was
compelled
to
give
up
this
thankless
task
on
its
own
accord
the
agrarian
problem
soon
made
it
clear
how
far
the
old
delusion
was
lagging
behind
the
actual
course
of
economic
events
and
conversely
how
powerfully
capitalist
development
in
russia
mourned
and
cursed
as
could
demonstrate
with
lightning
and
thunder
its
capacity
to
live
and
to
multiply
once
again
and
for
the
last
time
this
turn
of
events
demonstrates
in
quite
a
different
historical
setting
how
a
social
critique
of
capitalism
which
begins
by
doubting
its
capacity
for
development
must
by
a
deadly
logic
lead
to
a
reactionary
utopianism
both
in
the
france
of
and
in
the
russia
of
footnotes

vladimir
ilyich
lenin
has
given
detailed
proof
of
the
striking
similarity
between
the
position
of
the
russian
and
the
views
of
sismondi
in
his
essay
the
characteristics
of
economic
of
our
social
friedrich
engels
appraises
the
russian
situation
differently
he
repeatedly
tries
to
convince
nikolayon
that
russia
can
not
avoid
a
high
industrial
development
and
that
her
sufferings
are
nothing
but
the
typical
capitalist
contradictions
thus
he
writes
on
september
therefore
hold
that
at
present
industrial
production
necessarily
implies
big
industry
making
use
of
steam
power
electricity
mechanical
looms
and
frames
and
lastly
the
manufacture
of
the
machines
themselves
by
mechanical
means
from
the
moment
that
railways
are
introduced
in
russia
recourse
to
all
these
extremely
modern
means
of
production
becomes
inevitable
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
be
able
to
mend
and
repair
your
engines
coaches
railways
and
the
like
but
to
do
this
cheaply
you
must
also
be
in
a
position
to
make
at
home
the
things
needing
repair
as
soon
as
the
technique
of
war
has
become
a
branch
of
industry
cruisers
modern
artillery
machine
guns
steel
bullets
smokeless
gun
powder
etc
a
big
industry
that
is
indispensable
for
the
production
of
such
items
has
become
a
political
necessity
for
you
as
well
all
these
items
can
not
be
made
without
a
highly
developed
metal
industry
which
on
its
part
can
not
develop
unless
there
is
a
corresponding
development
of
all
other
branches
of
production
textiles
in
particular
to
nikolayon
petersburg
and
further
in
the
same
letter
long
as
russian
industry
depends
on
the
home
market
alone
it
can
only
satisfy
the
internal
demand
the
latter
however
can
grow
but
slowly
and
it
seems
to
me
that
under
present
conditions
of
life
in
russia
it
is
even
bound
to
decrease
since
it
is
one
of
the
unavoidable
consequences
of
high
industrial
development
that
it
destroys
its
own
home
market
by
the
same
process
which
served
to
create
it
by
destroying
the
bases
of
the
peasants
domestic
industry
yet
peasants
can
not
live
without
such
a
domestic
industry
they
are
ruined
as
peasants
their
purchasing
power
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
and
unless
they
grow
new
roots
in
new
conditions
of
life
unless
they
become
proletarians
they
will
only
represent
a
very
small
market
for
the
newly
arising
plants
and
factories
production
is
a
phase
of
economic
transition
full
of
inherent
contradictions
which
only
develop
and
become
visible
to
the
extent
that
capitalist
production
develops
the
tendency
of
simultaneously
creating
and
destroying
a
market
is
just
one
of
these
contradictions
another
is
the
hopeless
situation
that
will
ensue
all
the
sooner
in
a
country
like
russia
which
lacks
external
markets
than
in
countries
more
or
less
fit
to
compete
in
the
open
world
market
these
latter
can
find
some
means
of
relief
in
this
seemingly
hopeless
situation
by
heroic
measures
of
commercial
policy
that
is
to
say
by
forcibly
opening
up
new
markets
china
is
the
most
recent
market
to
be
opened
up
for
english
commerce
and
it
proved
adequate
for
a
temporary
revival
of
prosperity
that
is
why
english
capital
is
so
insistent
on
railroad
building
in
china
yet
railways
in
china
mean
the
destruction
of
the
entire
foundation
of
china
small
rural
enterprises
and
her
domestic
industry
in
this
case
there
is
not
even
a
native
big
industry
developed
to
compensate
for
this
evil
to
some
extent
and
hundreds
of
millions
will
consequently
find
it
impossible
to
make
a
living
at
all
the
result
will
be
mass
emigration
such
as
the
world
has
never
yet
seen
and
america
asia
and
europe
will
be
flooded
with
the
detested
chinese
this
new
competitor
on
the
labour
market
will
compete
with
american
australian
and
european
labour
at
the
level
of
what
the
chinese
consider
a
satisfactory
standard
of
living
which
is
well
known
to
be
the
lowest
in
the
whole
world
well
then
if
the
whole
system
of
production
in
europe
has
not
been
revolutionised
by
then
that
will
be
the
time
to
start
this
revolution
engels
though
he
followed
russian
developments
with
attention
and
keen
interest
persistently
refused
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
russian
dispute
in
his
letter
of
november
shortly
before
his
death
he
expressed
himself
as

almost
daily
and
weekly
bombard
me
with
requests
to
come
forward
with
my
objections
to
russian

and
reviews
which
not
only
misinterpret
but
even
misquote
the
sayings
of
our

my

assure
me
that
my

would
suffice
to
put
matters
right
yet
i
invariably
and
firmly

such

in
a
tongue
which
i
at
least
can
not
read
as
easily
and
freely
as
the
more
familiar
european
languages
and
in
a
literature
which
is
at
best
accessible

me
only
in
fortuitous

of

which
i
can
not

its

without
neglecting
my
real
and
serious

there
are

who
once
they
have
taken
up
a
certain
stand
are
not
ashamed
to
have
recourse
to
misinterpreting
the
thoughts
of
others
and
to
all
kinds
of
dishonest
manipulations
for
their
own
ends
and
if
that
is
what
has
happened
to
our
author
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
deal
more
kindly
with
me
so
that
in
the
end
i
shall
be
compelled
to
interfere
in
the
dispute
first
to
defend
others
and
then
in
my
own
defence
we
might
mention
that
the
surviving
champions
of
pessimism
and
vorontsov
in
particular
to
the
last
remained
loyal
to
their
views
in
spite
of
all
that
happened
in
russia
a
fact
that
does
more
credit
to
their
character
than
to
their
intelligence
referring
to
the
and
crises
vorontsov
wrote
in
doctrinaire
dogma
of
the
rapidly
loses
its
power
over
people
minds
that
the
newest
successes
of
the
individualists
are
ephemeral
has
obviously
dawned
even
on
their
official
advocates
in
the
first
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
we
come
back
to
the
same
views
about
economic
development
in
russia
that
had
been
the
legacy
of
the
cf
the
review
october
quoted
by
finn
yenotayevski
in
contemporary
economy
of
russia
petersburg
p
even
then
this
last
of
the
mohicans
deduces
the
character
not
of
his
own
theory
but
of
economic
reality
what
of
the
saying
of
barrère
a
que
les
morts
qui
ne
reviennent
pas
struve
persons
and
world
we
now
turn
to
the
criticism
of
the
above
opinions
as
given
by
the
russian
marxists
in
peter
struve
who
had
already
given
a
detailed
appraisal
of
nikolayon
book
in
an
essay
capitalist
development
in
russia
published
a
book
in
russian
criticising
the
theories
of
from
various
aspects
in
respect
of
our
present
problem
however
he
mainly
confines
himself
to
proving
against
both
vorontsov
and
nikolayon
that
capitalism
does
not
cause
a
contraction
of
the
home
market
but
on
the
contrary
an
expansion
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
nikolayon
has
made
a
blunder
the
same
that
sismondi
had
made
they
each
describe
only
a
single
aspect
of
the
destructive
process
performed
by
capitalism
on
the
traditional
forms
of
production
by
small
enterprise
they
saw
only
the
resulting
depression
of
general
welfare
the
impoverishment
of
broad
strata
of
the
population
and
failed
to
notice
that
economic
aspect
of
the
process
which
entails
the
abolition
of
natural
economy
and
the
substitution
of
a
commodity
economy
in
rural
districts
and
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
by
absorbing
further
and
further
sections
of
formerly
independent
and
producers
into
its
own
sphere
capitalism
continuously
transforms
into
commodity
buyers
ever
new
strata
of
people
who
had
not
before
bought
its
commodities
in
fact
the
course
of
capitalist
development
is
just
the
opposite
of
that
pictured
by
the
on
the
model
of
sismondi
capitalism
far
from
ruining
the
home
market
really
sets
about
creating
it
precisely
by
means
of
a
spreading
money
economy
struve
in
particular
refutes
the
theory
that
the
surplus
value
can
not
possibly
be
realised
on
the
home
market
he
argues
as
follows
the
conviction
that
a
mature
capitalist
society
consists
exclusively
of
entrepreneurs
and
workers
forms
the
basis
of
vorontsov
theory
and
nikolayon
himself
operates
with
this
concept
throughout
from
this
point
of
view
of
course
the
realisation
of
the
capitalist
aggregate
product
seems
incomprehensible
and
vorontsov
theory
is
correct
in
so
far
as
it
states
the
fact
that
neither
the
capitalists
nor
the
consumption
can
realise
the
surplus
value
so
that
the
existence
of
persons
must
be
presumed
but
then
is
it
not
beyond
any
doubt
that
some
such
persons
exist
in
every
capitalist
society
the
idea
of
vorontsov
and
nikolayon
is
pure
fiction
can
not
advance
our
understanding
of
any
historical
process
whatever
by
a
breadth
there
is
no
actual
capitalist
society
however
highly
developed
composed
exclusively
of
capitalists
and
workers
in
england
and
wales
out
of
a
thousand
inhabitants
are
engaged
in
industry
in
commerce
in
agriculture
in
casual
wage
labour
and
in
the
civil
service
the
liberal
professions
and
the
like
even
in
england
then
there
are
large
numbers
of
persons
and
it
is
they
who
by
their
consumption
help
to
realise
the
surplus
value
in
so
far
as
it
is
not
consumed
by
the
capitalists
struve
leaves
it
open
whether
these
persons
consume
enough
to
realise
all
surplus
value
however
that
may
be
contrary
would
have
to
be
proved
this
can
not
be
done
he
claims
for
russia
that
vast
country
with
an
immense
population
she
in
fact
is
in
the
fortunate
position
to
be
able
to
dispense
with
foreign
markets
in
this
and
here
struve
dips
into
the
intellectual
treasures
of
professors
wagner
schaeffle
and
schmoller
she
enjoys
the
same
privileges
as
the
united
states
of
america
the
example
of
the
american
union
stands
for
anything
it
is
proof
of
the
fact
that
under
certain
circumstances
capitalist
industry
can
attain
a
very
high
level
of
development
almost
entirely
on
the
basis
of
the
home
market
the
negligible
amount
of
industrial
exports
from
the
in
is
mentioned
in
support
of
this
statement
which
struve
formulates
as
a
general
doctrine
vaster
the
territory
and
the
larger
the
population
of
a
country
the
less
does
that
country
require
foreign
markets
for
its
capitalist
development
he
infers
from
this
in
direct
opposition
to
the
more
brilliant
future
for
russia
than
for
the
other
countries
on
the
basis
of
commodity
production
the
progressive
development
of
agriculture
is
bound
to
create
a
market
wide
enough
to
support
the
development
of
russian
industrial
capitalism
this
market
would
be
capable
of
unlimited
expansion
in
step
with
the
economic
and
cultural
progress
of
the
country
and
together
with
the
substitution
of
a
monetary
for
a
natural
economy
this
respect
capitalism
enjoys
more
favourable
conditions
in
russia
than
in
other
countries
struve
paints
a
detailed
and
highly
coloured
picture
of
the
new
markets
which
thanks
to
the
railway
are
opening
up
in
siberia
central
asia
asia
minor
persia
and
the
balkans
but
his
prophetic
zeal
blinds
him
to
the
fact
that
he
is
no
longer
talking
about
the
expanding
home
market
but
about
specific
foreign
markets
in
later
years
he
was
to
throw
in
his
lot
in
politics
too
with
this
optimistic
russian
capitalism
and
its
liberal
programme
of
imperialist
expansion
for
which
he
had
laid
the
theoretical
foundations
when
still
a
indeed
the
tenor
of
struve
argument
is
a
fervent
belief
in
the
unlimited
capacity
for
expansion
of
capitalist
production
but
the
economic
foundation
of
this
optimism
is
rather
weak
he
is
somewhat
reticent
as
to
what
he
means
by
the
persons
whom
he
considers
the
mainstay
of
accumulation
but
his
references
to
english
occupational
statistics
indicate
that
he
has
in
mind
the
various
private
and
public
servants
the
liberal
professions
in
short
the
notorious
so
dear
to
bourgeois
economists
when
they
are
completely
at
a
loss
it
is
this
public
of
which
marx
said
that
it
serves
as
the
explanation
for
things
which
the
economist
can
not
explain
it
is
obvious
that
if
we
categorically
refer
to
consumption
by
the
capitalists
and
the
workers
we
do
not
speak
of
the
entrepreneur
as
an
individual
but
of
the
capitalist
class
as
a
whole
including
their
employees
civil
servants
liberal
professions
and
the
like
all
such
persons
who
are
certainly
not
lacking
in
any
capitalist
society
are
as
far
as
economics
is
concerned
joint
consumers
of
the
surplus
value
for
the
greater
part
in
so
far
namely
as
they
are
not
also
joint
consumers
of
the
wages
of
labour
these
groups
can
only
derive
their
purchasing
power
either
from
the
wage
of
the
proletariat
or
from
the
surplus
value
if
not
from
both
but
on
the
whole
they
are
to
be
regarded
as
joint
consumers
of
the
surplus
value
it
follows
that
their
consumption
is
already
included
in
the
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
and
if
struve
tries
to
reintroduce
them
to
the
capitalists
by
as
persons
to
save
the
situation
and
help
to
realise
the
surplus
value
the
shrewd
profiteer
will
not
be
taken
in
he
will
see
at
once
that
this
great
public
is
nothing
but
his
old
familiar
retinue
of
parasites
who
buy
his
commodities
with
money
of
his
own
providing
no
no
indeed
struve
persons
will
not
do
at
all
struve
theory
of
foreign
markets
and
their
significance
for
capitalist
production
is
equally
untenable
in
this
he
defers
to
the
mechanist
approach
of
the
who
along
with
the
professors
textbooks
hold
that
a
capitalist
european
country
will
first
exploit
the
home
market
to
the
limit
and
will
only
look
to
foreign
markets
when
this
is
almost
or
completely
exhausted
then
following
in
the
footsteps
of
wagner
schaeffle
and
schmoller
struve
arrives
at
the
absurd
conclusion
that
a
country
with
vast
territories
and
a
large
population
can
make
its
capitalist
production
a
whole
and
rely
indefinitely
on
the
home
market
alone
in
actual
fact
capitalist
production
is
by
nature
production
on
a
universal
scale
quite
contrary
to
the
bookish
decrees
issued
by
german
scholars
it
is
producing
for
a
world
market
already
from
the
word
the
various
pioneering
branches
of
capitalist
production
in
england
such
as
the
textile
iron
and
coal
industries
cast
about
for
markets
in
all
countries
and
continents
long
before
the
process
of
destroying
peasants
property
the
decline
of
handicraft
and
of
the
old
domestic
industries
within
the
country
had
come
to
an
end
and
again
is
it
likely
that
the
german
chemical
or
electrotechnical
industries
would
be
grateful
for
the
sober
advice
not
to
work
for
five
continents
as
they
have
done
from
the
beginning
but
to
confine
themselves
to
the
german
home
market
which
being
largely
supplied
from
abroad
is
evidently
far
from
exhausted
in
respect
of
a
whole
lot
of
other
german
industries
or
that
one
should
explain
to
the
german
machine
industry
it
should
not
venture
yet
upon
foreign
markets
since
german
import
statistics
are
visible
proof
that
a
good
deal
of
the
demand
in
germany
for
products
of
this
branch
is
satisfied
by
foreign
supplies
no
this
schematic
conception
of
trade
does
not
help
us
at
all
to
grasp
the
complexity
of
the
world
market
with
its
uncounted
ramifications
and
different
shades
in
the
division
of
labour
the
industrial
development
of
the
who
have
already
at
the
time
of
writing
become
a
dangerous
rival
to
britain
both
on
the
world
market
and
even
in
england
herself
just
as
they
have
beaten
german
competition
in
the
sphere
of
electrotechnics
both
in
the
world
market
and
in
germany
herself
has
given
the
lie
to
struve
inferences
already
when
they
were
put
on
paper
struve
also
shares
the
crude
view
of
the
russian
who
saw
hardly
more
than
a
merchant
sordid
concern
for
his
market
in
the
international
connections
of
capitalist
economy
and
its
historical
tendency
to
create
a
homogeneous
living
organism
based
on
social
division
of
labour
as
well
as
the
countless
variety
of
natural
wealth
and
productive
conditions
of
the
globe
moreover
he
accepts
the
three
empire
fiction
of
wagner
and
schmoller
the
empires
of
great
britain
russia
and
the
which
completely
ignores
or
artificially
minimises
the
vital
part
played
by
an
unlimited
supply
of
means
of
subsistence
of
raw
and
auxiliary
materials
and
of
labour
power
which
is
just
as
necessary
for
a
capitalist
industry
computed
in
terms
of
a
world
market
as
the
demand
for
finished
products
alone
the

of

cotton
industry
a
reflection
in
miniature
of
the
history
of
capitalism
in
general
spreading
over
five
continents
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
makes
a
mockery
of
the

pretensions
which
have

real
significance
to
provide

justification
for

bulgakov

and
at
once
denies
that
they
form
the

of

surplus
value
whence
does
it
obtain
the
means
to
buy
for
his
part
bulgakov
centres
the
whole
problem
from
the
first
in
the
analysis
of
the
social
aggregate
product
and
its
reproduction
as
given
by
marx
in
the
second
volume
of
he
has
a
thorough
grasp
of
the
fact
that
he
must
start
with
simple
reproduction
and
must
fully
understand
its
working
in
order
to
solve
the
question
of
accumulation
in
this
context
he
says
it
is
of
particular
importance
to
obtain
a
clear
picture
of
the
consumption
of
surplus
value
and
wages
in
such
branches
of
production
as
do
not
turn
out
goods
for
consumption
and
further
to
understand
fully
the
circulation
of
that
portion
of
the
social
aggregate
product
which
represents
constant
capital
this
he
argues
is
a
completely
new
problem
of
which
economists
had
not
even
been
aware
before
marx
brought
it
up
order
to
solve
this
problem
marx
divides
all
capitalistically
produced
commodities
into
two
great
and
fundamentally
different
categories
the
production
of
producer
and
consumer
goods
there
is
more
theoretical
importance
in
this
division
than
in
all
previous
squabbles
on
the
theory
of
markets
bulgakov
we
see
is
an
outspoken
and
enthusiastic
supporter
of
theory
the
object
of
his
study
as
he
puts
it
is
thus
a
critique
of
the
doctrine
that
capitalism
can
not
exist
without
external
markets
this
purpose
the
author
has
made
use
of
the
most
valuable
analysis
of
social
reproduction
given
by
marx
in
volume
ii
of
which
for
reasons
unknown
has
scarcely
been
utilised
in
economic
theory
though
this
analysis
can
not
be
taken
as
fully
completed
we
are
yet
of
opinion
that
even
in
its
present
fragmentary
shape
it
offers
an
adequate
foundation
for
a
solution
of
the
market
problem
that
differs
from
that
adopted
by
nikolayon
and
others
and
which
they
claim
to
have
found
in
marx
bulgakov
gives
the
following
formulation
of
his
solution
which
he
has
deduced
from
marx
himself
certain
conditions
capitalism
may
exist
solely
by
virtue
of
an
internal
market
it
is
not
an
inherent
necessity
peculiar
to
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
that
the
outside
market
be
able
to
absorb
the
surplus
of
capitalist
production
the
author
has
arrived
at
this
conclusion
in
consequence
of
his
study
of
the
analysis
of
social
reproduction
and
now
we
are
eager
to
hear
the
arguments
bulgakov
has
based
on
the
above
thesis
at
first
sight
they
prove
surprisingly
simple
bulgakov
faithfully
reproduces
marx
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
adding
comments
which
do
credit
to
his
insight
he
further
cites
marx
equally
familiar
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
and
this
indeed
is
the
proof
we
have
been
so
anxious
to
find
upon
what
we
have
said
it
will
not
be
difficult
now
to
determine
the
very
essence
of
accumulation
the
department
i
must
produce
additional
means
of
production
necessary
for
enlarging
both
its
own
production
and
that
of
department
ii
ii
in
its
turn
will
have
to
supply
additional
consumption
goods
to
enlarge
the
variable
capital
in
both
departments
disregarding
the
circulation
of
money
the
expansion
of
production
is
reduced
to
an
exchange
of
additional
products
of
i
needed
by
ii
against
additional
products
of
ii
needed
by
i
loyally
following
marx
deductions
bulgakov
does
not
notice
that
so
far
his
entire
thesis
is
nothing
but
words
he
believes
that
these
mathematical
solve
the
problem
of
accumulation
no
doubt
we
can
easily
imagine
proportions
such
as
those
he
has
copied
from
marx
and
there
is
expanding
these
will
apply
yet
bulgakov
overlooks
the
principal
problem
who
exactly
is
to
profit
by
an
expansion
such
as
that
whose
mechanism
he
examines
is
it
explained
just
because
we
can
put
the
mathematical
proportions
of
accumulation
on
paper
hardly
because
just
as
soon
as
bulgakov
has
declared
the
matter
settled
and
goes
on
to
introduce
the
circulation
of
money
into
the
analysis
he
right
away
comes
up
against
the
question
where
are
i
and
ii
to
get
the
money
for
the
purchase
of
additional
products
when
we
dealt
with
marx
time
and
again
the
weak
point
in
his
analysis
the
question
really
of
consumers
in
enlarged
reproduction
cropped
up
in
a
perverted
form
as
the
question
of
additional
money
sources
here
bulgakov
quite
slavishly
follows
marx
approach
accepting
his
misleading
formulation
of
the
problem
without
noticing
that
it
is
not
straightforward
although
he
knows
perfectly
well
that
himself
did
not
answer
this
question
in
the
drafts
which
were
used
to
compile
the
second
volume
of
it
should
be
all
the
more
interesting
to
see
what
answer
marx
russian
pupil
attempted
to
work
out
on
his
own
following
solution
bulgakov
says
to
us
to
correspond
best
to
marx
doctrine
as
a
whole
the
new
variable
capital
in
supplied
by
ii
for
both
departments
has
its
commodity
equivalent
in
surplus
value
ii
with
reference
to
simple
reproduction
we
have
already
seen
that
the
capitalists
themselves
must
throw
money
into
circulation
to
realise
their
surplus
value
money
which
ultimately
reverts
to
the
pocket
of
the
very
capitalist
it
came
from
the
quantity
of
money
required
for
the
circulation
of
the
surplus
value
is
determined
in
accordance
with
the
general
law
of
commodity
circulation
by
the
value
of
the
commodities
that
contained
it
divided
by
the
average
amount
of
money
turnover
this
same
law
must
apply
here
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
must
dispose
of
a
certain
amount
of
money
for
the
circulation
of
their
surplus
value
and
must
consequently
possess
certain
money
reserves
these
reserves
must
be
ample
enough
for
the
circulation
both
of
that
portion
of
the
surplus
value
which
represents
the
consumption
fund
and
of
that
which
is
to
be
accumulated
as
capital
bulgakov
further
argues
that
it
is
immaterial
to
the
question
how
much
money
is
required
to
circulate
a
certain
amount
of
commodities
inside
a
country
whether
or
not
some
of
these
commodities
contain
any
surplus
value
answer
to
the
general
question
as
to
money
sources
inside
the
country
however
our
solution
is
that
the
money
is
supplied
by
the
producer
of
gold
if
a
country
requires
more
money
consequent
upon
an
of
production
the
production
of
gold
will
have
to
be
increased
accordingly
so
here
we
are
again
the
producer
of
gold
is
again
the
ex
just
as
he
had
been
for
marx
in
fact
bulgakov
has
sadly
disappointed
us
in
the
high
hopes
we
had
of
his
new
solution
his
of
the
problem
does
not
go
a
step
beyond
marx
own
analysis
it
can
be
reduced
to
three
extremely
simple
statements
as
follows
question
how
much
money
do
we
need
for
the
realisation
of
capitalised
surplus
value
answer
just
as
much
as
is
required
in
accordance
with
the
general
law
of
commodity
circulation
where
do
the
capitalists
get
the
money
for
the
realisation
of
capitalised
surplus
value
they
are
supposed
to
have
it
how
did
the
money
come
into
the
country
in
the
first
place
it
is
provided
by
the
producer
of
gold
the
extreme
simplicity
of
this
method
of
explanation
is
suspicious
rather
than
attractive
we
need
not
trouble
however
to
refute
this
theory
which
makes
the
gold
producer
the
ex
of
capitalist
accumulation
bulgakov
has
done
it
himself
quite
adequately
eighty
pages
on
he
returns
to
the
gold
producer
in
quite
a
different
context
in
the
course
of
a
lengthy
argument
against
the
theory
of
the
wages
fund
in
which
he
got
involved
for
some
mysterious
reason
here
he
suddenly
displays
a
keen
grasp
of
the
problem
know
already
that
there
is
a
gold
producer
amongst
other
producers
even
under
conditions
of
simple
reproduction
he
increases
on
the
one
hand
the
absolute
quantity
of
money
circulating
inside
the
country
and
on
the
other
he
buys
producer
and
consumer
goods
without
in
his
turn
selling
commodities
paying
with
his
own
product
with
the
general
exchange
equivalent
for
the
goods
he
buys
the
gold
producer
now
might
perhaps
render
the
service
of
buying
the
whole
accumulated
surplus
value
from
ii
and
pay
for
it
in
gold
which
ii
can
then
use
to
buy
means
of
production
from
i
and
to
increase
its
variable
capital
needed
to
pay
for
additional
labour
power
so
that
the
gold
producer
now
appears
as
the
real
external
market
assumption
however
is
quite
absurd
to
accept
it
would
mean
to
make
the
expansion
of
social
production
dependent
upon
the
expansion
of
gold
production
hear
hear
this
in
turn
presupposes
an
increase
in
gold
production
which
is
quite
unreal
if
the
gold
producer
were
obliged
to
buy
all
the
accumulated
surplus
value
from
ii
for
his
own
workers
his
own
variable
capital
would
have
to
grow
by
the
day
and
indeed
by
the
hour
yet
his
constant
capital
as
well
as
his
surplus
value
should
also
grow
in
proportion
and
gold
production
as
a
whole
would
consequently
have
to
take
on
immense
dimensions
hear
hear
instead
of
submitting
this
sophistical
presumption
to
statistical
tests
which
in
any
case
would
hardly
be
possible
a
single
fact
can
be
adduced
which
would
alone
refute
this
presupposition
it
is
the
development
of
the
institution
of
credit
which
accompanies
the
development
of
capitalist
economy
hear
hear
credit
has
the
tendency
to
diminish
the
amount
of
money
in
circulation
this
decrease
being
of
course
only
relative
not
absolute
it
is
the
necessary
complement
of
a
developing
economy
of
exchange
which
would
otherwise
soon
find
itself
hampered
by
a
lack
of
coined
money
i
think
we
need
not
give
figures
in
this
context
to
prove
that
the
rôle
of
money
in
is
now
very
small
the
hypothesis
is
thus
proved
in
immediate
and
evident
disagreement
with
the
facts
and
must
be
confuted
bravo
bravissimo
this
is
really
excellent
bulgakov
however
thus
also
his
former
explanation
of
the
question
in
what
way
and
by
whom
capitalised
surplus
value
is
realised
moreover
in
refuting
his
own
statements
bulgakov
has
only
explained
in
somewhat
greater
detail
what
marx
expressed
in
a
single
word
when
he
called
the
hypothesis
of
a
gold
producer
swallowing
up
the
entire
surplus
value
of
society
admittedly
bulgakov
real
solution
and
that
of
russian
marxists
in
general
who
deal
extensively
with
the
problem
must
be
sought
elsewhere
just
like
tugan
baranovski
and
ilyin
lenin
bulgakov
underlines
the
fact
that
the
opposing
sceptics
made
a
capital
error
with
respect
to
the
possibility
of
accumulation
in
analysing
the
value
of
the
aggregate
product
they
especially
vorontsov
assumed
that
the
aggregate
social
product
consists
in
consumer
goods
and
they
all
started
from
the
false
premise
that
consumption
is
indeed
the
object
of
capitalist
production
this
as
the
marxists
now
explain
is
the
source
of
the
entire
misunderstanding
of
all
the
imaginary
difficulties
connected
with
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
with
which
the
sceptics
racked
their
brains
school
created
difficulties
because
of
this
mistaken
conception
since
the
normal
conditions
of
capitalist
production
presuppose
that
the
capitalists
consumption
fund
is
only
a
part
of
the
surplus
value
and
the
smaller
part
at
that
the
larger
being
set
aside
for
the
expansion
of
production
it
is
obvious
that
the
difficulties
imagined
by
this
the
school
do
not
really
exist
the
unconcern
with
which
bulgakov
here
ignores
the
real
problem
is
striking
apparently
it
has
not
dawned
on
him
that
the
question
as
to
the
ultimate
beneficiaries
quite
irrelevant
so
long
as
personal
consumption
of
the
entire
surplus
value
is
assumed
only
becomes
acute
on
the
assumption
of
enlarged
reproduction
all
these
difficulties
vanish
thanks
to
two
discoveries
of
marx
which
his
russian
pupils
untiringly
quote
against
their
opponents
the
first
is
the
fact
that
in
terms
of
value
the
social
product
is
composed
not
of
but
of
v
secondly
the
ratio
of
to
in
this
sum
continually
increases
with
the
progress
of
capitalist
production
and
at
the
same
time
the
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
as
against
that
part
of
it
that
is
consumed
is
ever
growing
on
this
basis
bulgakov
establishes
a
complete
theory
of
the
relations
between
production
and
consumption
in
a
capitalist
society
as
this
theory
plays
such
an
important
part
for
the
russian
marxists
in
general
and
bulgakov
in
particular
it
will
be
necessary
to
get
better
acquainted
with
it
bulgakov
says
satisfaction
of
social
needs
is
but
an
incidental
moment
in
the
circulation
of
capital
the
volume
of
production
is
determined
by
the
volume
of
capital
and
not
by
the
amount
of
social
requirements
not
alone
that
the
development
of
production
is
unaccompanied
by
a
growth
in
consumption
the
two
are
mutually
antagonistic
capitalist
production
knows
no
other
than
effective
consumption
but
only
such
persons
who
draw
either
surplus
value
or
labour
wages
can
be
effective
consumers
and
their
purchasing
power
strictly
corresponds
to
the
amount
of
those
revenues
yet
we
have
seen
that
the
fundamental
evolutionary
laws
of
capitalist
production
tend
despite
the
absolute
increase
to
diminish
the
relative
size
of
variable
capital
as
well
as
of
the
capitalists
consumption
fund
we
can
say
then
the
development
of
production
diminishes
the
conditions
of
production
and
of
consumption
are
thus
in
conflict
production
can
not
and
does
not
expand
to
further
consumption
expansion
however
is
an
inherent
fundamental
law
of
capitalist
production
and
confronts
every
individual
capitalist
in
the
form
of
a
stern
command
to
compete
this
contradiction
is
negligible
in
view
of
the
fact
that
expanding
production
as
such
represents
a
market
for
additional
products
inherent
contradictions
are
resolved
by
an
extension
of
the
outlying
fields
of
production
bulgakov
here
quotes
a
saying
of
marx
which
he
has
thoroughly
misunderstood
we
shall
later
have
occasion
to
deal
with
it
once
more
has
just
been
shown
how
this
is
possible
a
reference
to
the
analysis
of
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
greater
share
of
the
expansion
is
apportioned
to
department
i
to
the
production
that
is
to
say
of
constant
capital
and
only
a
relatively
smaller
part
to
department
ii
which
produces
commodities
for
immediate
consumption
this
change
in
the
relations
of
the
two
departments
shows
well
enough
what
part
is
played
by
consumption
in
a
capitalist
society
and
it
indicates
where
we
should
expect
to
find
the
most
important
demand
for
capitalist
commodities
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
profit
motive
and
the
crises
even
on
this
strait
and
narrow
path
capitalist
production
is
capable
of
unlimited
expansion
irrespective
of
and
even
despite
a
decrease
in
consumption
the
russian
literature
frequently
points
out
that
in
view
of
diminishing
consumption
a
considerable
increase
of
capitalist
production
is
impossible
without
external
markets
but
this
is
due
to
a
wrong
evaluation
of
the
part
played
by
consumption
in
a
capitalist
society
the
failure
to
appreciate
that
consumption
is
not
the
ultimate
end
of
capitalist
production
capitalist
production
does
not
exist
by
the
grace
of
an
increase
in
consumption
but
because
of
an
extension
of
the
outlying
fields
of
production
which
in
fact
constitute
the
market
for
capitalist
products
a
whole
progression
of
malthusian
investigators
discontented
with
the
superficial
harmony
doctrine
of
the
school
of
say
and
ricardo
have
slaved
away
at
a
solution
of
the
hopeless
undertaking
to
find
means
of
increasing
consumption
which
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
is
bound
to
decrease
marx
was
the
only
one
to
analyse
the
real
connections
he
has
shown
that
the
growth
of
consumption
is
fatally
lagging
behind
that
of
production
and
must
do
so
whatever
third
persons
one
might
invent
consumption
and
its
volume
then
should
by
no
means
be
considered
as
establishing
the
immediate
limits
to
the
expansion
of
production
capitalist
production
atones
by
the
crises
for
deviating
from
the
true
purpose
of
production
but
it
is
independent
of
consumption
the
expansion
of
production
is
alone
limited
by
and
dependent
upon
the
volume
of
capital
the
theory
of
bulgakov
and
tugan
baranovski
is
here
directly
attributed
to
marx
in
the
eyes
of
the
russian
marxists
it
is
on
the
whole
the
direct
consequence
of
marx
doctrine
of
which
it
forms
an
organic
part
on
another
occasion
bulgakov
says
even
more
clearly
that
it
is
a
faithful
interpretation
of
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
once
a
country
has
embraced
capitalist
production
its
internal
movement
develops
along
the
following
lines
production
of
constant
capital
makes
up
the
department
i
of
social
reproduction
thereby
instituting
an
independent
demand

a
closed
circle
is
already
formed
at
the
initial
stage
of
capitalist
production
in
which
it
depends
on
no
external
market
but
is
and
can
grow
of
itself
as
it
were
by
means
of
in
the
hands
of
the
russian
marxists
this
theory
becomes
the
favourite
stick
with
which
to
beat
their
opponents
the
sceptics
in
the
question
of
markets
we
can
only
appreciate
its
daring
to
the
full
when
we
look
at
its
amazing
discrepancy
with
everyday
practice
with
all
the
known
facts
of
capitalist
economy
a
thesis
pronounced
so
triumphantly
as
the
purest
marxist
gospel
is
even
more
deserving
of
our
admiration
when
we
consider
that
it
is
grounded
in
an
extremely
simple
confusion
we
shall
have
further
occasion
to
deal
with
this
confusion
when
we
come
to
the
doctrine
of
tugan
baranovski
bulgakov
further
develops
a
completely
erroneous
theory
of
foreign
commerce
based
upon
his
misapprehension
of
the
relations
between
consumption
and
production
in
capitalist
economy
a
picture
of
reproduction
like
the
above
in
fact
has
no
room
for
foreign
commerce
if
capitalism
forms
a
circle
in
every
country
from
the
very
beginning
if
chasing
its
tail
like
a
puppy
and
in
complete
it
is
able
of
itself
to
create
an
unlimited
market
for
its
products
and
can
spur
itself
on
to
ever
greater
expansion
then
every
capitalist
country
as
such
must
also
be
a
closed
and
economic
whole
in
but
a
single
respect
would
foreign
commerce
appear
reasonable
to
compensate
by
imports
from
abroad
for
certain
deficiencies
due
to
the
soil
and
the
climate
the
import
of
raw
materials
or
foodstuffs
from
sheer
necessity
completely
upsetting
the
thesis
of
the
bulgakov
in
fact
advances
a
theory
of
international
commerce
among
capitalist
states
which
gives
pride
of
place
to
the
import
of
agricultural
products
with
industrial
exports
merely
providing
the
requisite
funds
international
traffic
in
commodities
does
not
here
seem
to
flow
from
the
character
of
the
mode
of
production
but
from
the
natural
conditions
of
the
countries
concerned
this
theory
at
any
rate
has
not
been
borrowed
from
marx
but
from
the
economic
experts
of
the
german
bourgeoisie
just
as
struve
took
over
from
wagner
and
schaeffle
his
three
empire
theory
so
bulgakov
adopts
from
the
late
list
the
division
of
states
on
the
basis
of
and
agriculture
and
manufacture
or
rather
adapts
it
in
deference
to
the
times
to
the
categories
of
and
manufacture
and
agriculture
nature
has
afflicted
the
first
category
with
a
deficiency
in
raw
materials
and
foodstuffs
making
it
thus
dependent
upon
foreign
commerce
the
second
category
has
been
liberally
endowed
with
all
it
needs
here
foreign
trade
is
of
no
account
the
prototype
of
the
first
category
is
england
of
the
second
the
the
stoppage
of
foreign
commerce
would
mean
the
economic
to
england
but
only
a
temporary
crisis
in
the
with
a
guarantee
of
full
recovery
there
is
capable
of
unlimited
expansion
on
the
basis
of
the
internal
market
this
theory
a
hoary
relic
of
german
economics
even
now
has
obviously
not
the
least
grasp
of
the
interrelations
obtaining
in
an
international
capitalist
economy
it
conceives
of
modern
international
trade
in
terms
that
may
have
been
appropriate
to
the
times
of
the
phoenicians
just
listen
to
the
lecture
of
professor
buecher
the
liberalist
era
has
greatly
facilitated
international
traffic
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
infer
from
this
that
the
period
of
a
national
economy
is
nearing
its
end
to
be
replaced
by
a
period
of
international
economy
granted
that
we
see
in
europe
a
number
of
small
countries
that
are
not
independent
nations
in
respect
of
their
commodity
supply
being
compelled
to
import
substantial
amounts
of
their
foodstuffs
and
luxuries
while
their
industrial
productivity
is
in
excess
of
the
national
needs
and
creates
a
permanent
surplus
for
which
employment
must
be
found
in
alien
spheres
of
consumption
yet
although
countries
of
industrial
production
and
those
producing
raw
materials
exist
side
by
side
and
depend
upon
one
another
such
international
division
of
labour
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
sign
that
mankind
is
about
to
attain
to
a
higher
stage
of
development
which
it
would
be
proper
to
contrast
under
the
label
of
world
economy
with
the
previous
stages
no
stage
of
economic
development
has
ever
permanently
guaranteed
full
autonomy
in
the
satisfaction
of
wants
every
one
of
them
has
left
certain
gaps
which
had
to
be
filled
in
by
some
means
or
other
international
economy
on
the
other
hand
has
not
at
any
rate
so
far
engendered
any
phenomena
which
are
essentially
different
from
those
of
national
economy
and
we
very
much
doubt
that
such
phenomena
will
appear
in
the
near
future
as
far
as
bulgakov
is
concerned
this
conception
at
any
rate
results
in
an
unexpected
conclusion
his
theory
of
the
unlimited
capacity
for
development
of
capitalism
is
confined
to
certain
countries
with
favourable
natural
conditions
capitalism
in
england
is
foredoomed
because
the
world
market
will
be
exhausted
before
long
in
the
india
and
russia
it
can
look
forward
to
an
unlimited
development
because
these
countries
are
apart
from
these
obvious
peculiarities
bulgakov
arguments
about
foreign
commerce
again
imply
a
fundamental
misconception
against
the
sceptics
from
sismondi
to
nikolayon
who
believed
that
they
had
to
take
recourse
to
outside
markets
for
the
realisation
of
capitalist
surplus
value
he
chiefly
argues
as
follows
experts
obviously
consider
external
commerce
as
a
bottomless
pit
to
swallow
up
in
all
eternity
the
surplus
value
which
can
not
be
got
rid
of
inside
the
country
bulgakov
for
his
part
triumphantly
points
out
that
foreign
commerce
is
indeed
not
a
pit
and
certainly
not
a
bottomless
one
but
rather
appears
as
a
sword
that
exports
always
belong
with
imports
and
that
the
two
usually
counterbalance
one
another
thus
whatever
is
pushed
out
over
one
border
will
be
brought
back
in
a
changed
over
another
must
find
room
for
the
commodities
that
have
been
imported
as
an
equivalent
of
those
exported
within
the
bounds
of
the
given
market
and
as
this
is
impossible
it
would
only
generate
new
difficulties
to
have
recourse
to
an
external
demand
on
another
occasion
he
says
that
the
way
to
realise
the
surplus
value
found
by
the
russian
viz
external
markets
much
less
favourable
than
that
discovered
by
malthus
kirchmann
and
vorontsov
himself
when
he
wrote
the
essay
militarism
and
although
bulgakov
fervently
copies
marx
diagram
of
reproduction
he
here
exhibits
no
grasp
whatever
of
the
real
problem
towards
which
the
sceptics
from
sismondi
to
nikolayon
were
groping
their
way
he
denies
that
foreign
commerce
solves
the
difficulty
as
pretended
since
it
again
brings
the
surplus
value
that
has
been
disposed
of
into
the
country
although
in
a
form
in
conformity
with
the
crude
picture
of
kirchmann
and
vorontsov
he
thus
believes
the
problem
to
be
that
of
destroying
a
certain
quantity
of
the
surplus
value
of
wiping
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth
it
simply
does
not
occur
to
him
that
the
real
problem
is
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
the
metamorphosis
of
commodities
in
fact
the
form
of
the
surplus
value
bulgakov
thus
finally
arrives
at
the
same
goal
as
struve
though
by
a
different
route
he
preaches
the
of
capitalist
accumulation
which
swallows
up
its
own
product
as
kronos
swallows
up
his
children
and
breeds
ever
more
vigorously
without
help
from
outside
now
only
one
further
step
is
needed
for
marxism
to
revert
to
bourgeois
economics

luck
would
have

professor
sombart
theory
is
the
most
recent
contribution
in
this
field
he
argues
that
we
are
not
moving
towards
an
international
economy
but
rather
farther
and
farther
away
from
it
maintain
on
the
contrary
that
commercial
relations
do
not
form
a
stronger
but
rather
a
weaker
link
between
the
civilised
nations
in
relation
to
their
economy
as
a
whole
individual
economy
takes
not
more
but
rather
less
account
of
the
world
market
than
it
did
a
hundred
or
fifty
years
ago
at
least
it
would
be
wrong
to
assume
that
the
relative
importance
of
international
relations
with
regard
to
modern
political
economy
is
increasing
the
opposite
is
the
case
sombart
scornfully
rejects
the
assumption
of
a
progressive
international
division
of
labour
of
a
growing
need
for
outside
markets
owing
to
an
inelastic
home
demand
he
in
his
turn
is
convinced
that
individual
national
economies
will
develop
into
ever
more
perfect
microcosms
and
that
the
importance
of
the
home
market
will
increasingly
surpass
that

this
devastating
discovery
admittedly
hinges
on
a
full
acceptance
of
the

peculiar
conception
which
for
some
reasons
only
considers
those
as
countries
who
pay
for
their

with
a
surplus
of
agricultural
products
over
and
above
their

russia

the

the

germany
england

sooner

also
claim
the
surplus
of

for
the

is
evident
that

another
of
sombart
discoveries
is
that
great
capitalist
countries
increasingly
obtain

in
form
of
interest

the
capital
exports

as

as
a
matter
of
fact
his
explanation
of
the
part
played
by

in
capitalist
production
is
far
more
correct
than
that
of
struve
and
bulgakov
tugan
baranovski
and
his
of
we
have
left
this
theorist
to
the
end
although
he
already
developed
his
views
in
russian
in
before
struve
and
bulgakov
partly
because
he
only
gave
his
theories
their
mature
form
in
german
at
a
later
date
and
also
because
the
conclusions
he
draws
from
the
premises
of
the
marxist
critics
are
the
most
in
their
implications
like
bulgakov
tugan
baranovski
starts
from
marx
analysis
of
social
reproduction
which
gave
him
the
clue
to
this
bewildering
maze
of
problems
but
while
bulgakov
the
enthusiastic
disciple
of
marx
only
sought
to
follow
him
faithfully
and
simply
attributed
his
own
conclusions
to
the
master
tugan
baranovski
on
the
other
hand
lays
down
the
law
to
marx
who
in
his
opinion
did
not
know
how
to
turn
his
brilliant
exposition
of
the
reproductive
process
to
good
account
tugan
baranovski
most
important
general
conclusion
from
marx
principles
the
pivot
of
his
whole
theory
is
that
contrary
to
the
assumptions
of
the
sceptics
capitalist
accumulation
is
not
only
possible
under
the
capitalist
forms
of
revenue
and
consumption
but
is
in
fact
completely
independent
of
both
it
is
not
consumption
he
says
but
production
itself
which
makes
for
the
best
market
production
and
the
market
are
therefore
the
same
and
since
the
expansion
of
production
is
unlimited
in
itself
the
market
the
capacity
to
absorb
its
products
has
no
limits
either
diagram
quoted
he
says
to
prove
conclusively
a
postulate
which
though
simple
enough
might
easily
give
rise
to
objections
unless
the
process
be
adequately
understood
the
postulate
namely
that
capitalist
production
creates
a
market
for
itself
so
long
as
it
is
possible
to
expand
social
production
if
the
productive
forces
are
adequate
for
this
purpose
the
proportionate
division
of
social
production
must
also
bring
about
a
corresponding
expansion
of
the
demand
inasmuch
as
under
such
conditions
all
newly
produced
goods
represent
a
newly
created
purchasing
power
for
the
acquisition
of
other
goods
comparing
simple
reproduction
of
the
social
capital
with
its
reproduction
on
a
rising
scale
we
arrive
at
the
most
important
conclusion
that
in
capitalist
economy
the
demand
for
commodities
is
in
a
sense
independent
of
the
total
volume
of
social
consumption
absurd
as
it
may
seem
to
it
is
yet
possible
that
the
volume
of
social
consumption
as
a
whole
goes
down
while
at
the
same
time
the
aggregate
social
demand
for
commodities
grows
and
again
further
on
from
the
abstract
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
of
social
capital
we
have
formed
the
conclusion
that
nothing
will
be
left
over
of
the
social
product
in
view
of
the
proportionate
division
of
the
social
capital
accordingly
tugan
baranovski
subjects
marx
theory
of
crises
to
a
revision
which
he
claims
to
have
developed
from
is
in
substantial
agreement
with
the
general
view
that
the
poverty
of
the
workers
of
the
great
majority
of
the
population
makes
it
impossible
to
realise
the
products
of
an
ever
expanding
capitalist
production
since
it
causes
a
decline
in
demand
this
opinion
is
definitely
mistaken
we
have
seen
that
capitalist
production
creates
its
own
market
consumption
being
only
one
of
the
moments
of
capitalist
production
in
a
planned
social
production
if
the
leaders
of
production
were
equipped
with
all
about
the
demand
and
with
the
to
transfer
labour
and
capital
freely
from
one
branch
of
production
to
another
then
however
low
the
level
of
social
consumption
the
supply
of
commodities
would
not
exceed
the
demand
the
only
circumstance
which
periodically
causes
the
market
to
be
flooded
is
a
lack
of
proportion
in
the
enlargement
of
production
on
this
assumption
therefore
tugan
baranovski
describes
the
course
of
capitalist
accumulation
as
follows
would
the
workers
produce
if
production
were
organised
on
proportionate
lines
obviously
their
own
means
of
subsistence
and
production
with
what
object
to
expand
production
in
the
second
year
the
production
of
what
products
again
of
means
of
production
and
subsistence
for
the
workers
and
so
on
this
game
of
question
and
answer
mind
you
is
not
a
form
of
it
is
meant
in
all
seriousness
the
expansion
of
production
has
no
practical
limits
then
we
must
assume
that
the
expansion
of
markets
is
equally
unlimited
for
social
production
is
proportionately
organised
there
is
no
limit
to
the
expansion
of
the
market
other
than
the
productive
forces
since
production
thus
creates
its
own
demand
foreign
commerce
of
capitalist
states
is
also
assigned
that
peculiar
mechanistic
function
we
have
already
met
in
bulgakov
a
foreign
market
for
instance
is
an
absolute
necessity
for
england
not
this
prove
that
capitalist
production
creates
a
surplus
product
for
which
there
is
no
room
on
the
internal
market
why
come
to
that
does
england
require
an
external
market
the
answer
is
not
difficult
because
a
considerable
part
of
england
purchasing
power
is
expended
on
obtaining
foreign
commodities
the
import
of
foreign
commodities
for
the
english
home
market
also
makes
it
essential
to
export
english
commodities
abroad
since
england
can
not
manage
without
importing
from
abroad
exports
are
a
vital
condition
for
that
country
since
without
them
she
would
not
be
able
to
pay
for
her
imports
here
again
agricultural
imports
are
described
as
a
stimulating
and
decisive
factor
quite
in
accordance
with
the
scheme
of
the
german
professors
what
then
is
the
general
line
of
reasoning
on
which
tugan
baranovski
supports
his
daring
solution
of
the
problem
of
accumulation
the
new
revelation
on
the
problem
of
crises
and
a
whole
lot
of
others
hard
to
believe
but
quite
incontrovertible
for
all
that
tugan
proof
consists
exclusively
and
entirely
in
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
no
more
no
less
although
he
repeatedly
refers
rather
pompously
to
his
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
of
social
capital
to
the
logic
of
his
analysis
this
entire
analysis
is
nothing
but
a
copy
of
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
with
a
different
set
of
figures
nowhere
in
the
entire
works
of
tugan
baranovski
shall
we
find
a
trace
of
any
other
argument
in
marx
diagram
admittedly
accumulation
production
realisation
and
exchange
run
smoothly
with
clockwork
precision
and
no
doubt
this
kind
of
can
continue
just
as
long
that
is
to
say
as
ink
and
paper
do
not
run
out
and
it
is
this
harmless
written
exercise
with
mathematical
equations
which
tugan
baranovski
quite
seriously
considers
a
of
such
a
course
in
real
events
diagrams
we
have
adduced
are
bound
to
prove
conclusively
that
on
another
occasion
he
counters
hobson
who
is
convinced
that
accumulation
is
impossible
with
the
following
words
no
of
the
reproduction
of
social
capital
on
a
rising
scale
corresponds
to
the
case
of
capital
accumulation
hobson
has
in
mind
but
does
this
diagram
show
a
surplus
product
to
come
into
being
far
from
it
hobson
is
refuted
and
the
matter
settled
because
the
diagram
no
surplus
product
comes
into
being
admittedly
tugan
baranovski
knows
quite
well
that
in
hard
fact
things
do
not
work
out
so
smoothly
there
are
continual
fluctuations
in
the
exchange
relations
and
periodical
crises
but
these
crises
happen
only
because
in
the
expansion
of
production
the
proper
proportions
are
not
maintained
because
that
is
to
say
the
proportions
of
no
are
not
observed
in
the
first
place
if
they
were
there
would
be
no
crisis
and
capitalist
production
could
get
along
as
nicely
as
it
does
on
paper
in
every
detail
tugan
baranovski
is
committed
to
the
view
that
we
can
ignore
the
crises
if
we
consider
the
reproductive
process
as
a
continuous
process
although
the
may
be
upset
at
any
moment
yet
on
average
it
will
always
be
by
different
deviations
by
from
day
to
day
and
in
the
long
run
by
periodical
crises
that
on
the
whole
this
is
more
or
less
maintained
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
capitalist
economy
is
still
going
strong
otherwise
it
would
long
ago
have
ended
in
chaos
and
collapse
in
the
long
run
then
tugan
baranovski
is
observed
by
and
large
and
we
must
conclude
that
reality
obeys
no
and
since
this
diagram
can
be
indefinitely
extended
it
follows
that
capitalist
accumulation
can
also
proceed
what
is
striking
in
all
this
is
not
tugan
baranovski
conclusion
that
the
diagram
corresponds
to
the
actual
course
of
events
as
we
have
seen
bulgakov
also
shared
this
belief
the
really
startling
fact
is
that
tugan
baranovski
sees
no
necessity
for
as
much
as
whether
the
diagram
is
correct
that
instead
of
proving
the
diagram
he
considers
this
the
arithmetical
exercise
on
paper
as
proof
of
the
actual
state
of
affairs
bulgakov
honestly
tried
to
project
diagram
on
the
real
concrete
relations
of
capitalist
economy
and
of
capitalist
exchange
he
endeavoured
to
overcome
the
difficulties
resulting
from
it
though
without
success
it
is
true
remaining
to
the
last
involved
with
marx
analysis
which
he
himself
recognised
to
be
incomplete
and
fragmentary
but
tugan
baranovski
does
not
need
any
proof
he
does
not
greatly
exercise
his
brains
since
the
arithmetical
sums
come
out
satisfactorily
and
may
be
continued
this
is
to
him
proof
that
capitalist
accumulation
can
also
proceed
without
let
or
hindrance
provided
the
said
obtains
which
it
will
have
to
do
by
hook
or
by
crook
as
he
himself
would
not
dream
of
denying
tugan
baranovski
however
has
one
indirect
proof
that
the
diagram
with
its
strange
results
corresponds
to
and
truly
reflects
reality
this
is
the
fact
that
capitalist
production
quite
in
accordance
with
diagram
puts
human
consumption
second
to
production
that
it
conceives
of
the
former
as
a
means
and
of
the
latter
as
an
end
in
itself
just
as
it
puts
human
labour
the
on
a
par
with
the
machine
progress
is
expressed
by
the
fact
that
the
means
of
labour
the
machine
increases
more
and
more
in
importance
as
compared
to
living
labour
to
the
worker
himself
means
of
production
play
an
ever
growing
part
in
the
productive
process
and
on
the
commodity
market
compared
to
the
machine
the
worker
recedes
further
into
the
background
and
the
demand
resulting
from
the
consumption
of
the
workers
is
also
put
into
the
shade
by
that
which
results
from
productive
consumption
by
the
means
of
production
the
entire
workings
of
capitalist
economy
take
on
the
character
of
a
mechanism
existing
on
its
own
as
it
were
in
which
human
consumption
appears
as
a
simple
moment
of
the
reproductive
process
and
the
circulation
of
capitals
tugan
baranovski
considers
this
discovery
as
a
fundamental
law
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
which
is
confirmed
by
a
quite
tangible
phenomenon
with
the
progress
of
capitalist
development
department
i
goes
on
growing
relatively
to
and
at
the
expense
of
department
ii
it
was
marx
himself
who
as
we
all
know
set
up
this
law
in
which
he
grounded
the
schematic
exposition
of
reproduction
though
in
the
further
development
of
his
diagram
he
ignored
subsequent
alterations
for
simplicity
sake
this
the
automatic
growth
of
the
producer
goods
as
compared
with
the
consumer
goods
department
affords
tugan
baranovski
the
only
objective
proof
of
his
theory
that
in
capitalist
society
human
consumption
becomes
increasingly
unimportant
and
production
more
and
more
an
end
in
itself
this
thesis
forms
the
of
his
entire
theoretical
edifice
all
the
industrial
countries
he
proclaims
are
confronted
with
the
same
type
of
development
the
development
of
national
economy
everywhere
follows
the
same
fundamental
law
the
mining
industry
which
creates
the
means
of
production
for
modern
industry
comes
more
and
more
to
the
fore
the
relative
decrease
in
the
export
of
immediately
consumable
manufactured
goods
from
britain
is
thus
also
an
expression
of
the
fundamental
law
governing
capitalist
development
the
further
technical
progress
advances
the
more
do
consumer
goods
recede
as
compared
with
producer
goods
human
consumption
plays
an
ever
decreasing
part
as
against
the
productive
consumption
of
the
means
of
production
although
this
law
like
all
his
other
laws
in
so
far
as
they
mean
anything
at
all
is
borrowed
from
marx
baranovski
does
not
rest
content
with
this
and
immediately
proceeds
to
preach
the
marxist
gospel
to
marx
himself
scrabbling
about
like
a
blind
hen
marx
has
turned
up
another
pearl
tugan
will
give
him
that
only
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
it
needed
a
tugan
baranovski
to
know
how
to
make
it
useful
to
science
and
in
his
hand
the
newly
discovered
law
suddenly
throws
a
new
light
on
the
whole
workings
of
capitalist
economy
this
law
of
the
expansion
in
the
department
of
producer
goods
at
the
cost
of
that
of
consumer
goods
reveals
clearly
concisely
exactly
and
in
measurable
terms
that
capitalist
society
attaches
progressively
less
importance
to
human
consumption
putting
man
on
the
same
level
as
the
means
of
production
and
that
marx
was
therefore
completely
wrong
both
in
assuming
that
man
alone
not
the
machine
too
can
be
the
creator
of
surplus
value
and
in
saying
further
that
human
consumption
represents
a
limit
for
capitalist
production
which
is
bound
to
cause
periodical
crises
in
the
present
and
the
collapse
and
terrible
end
of
capitalist
economy
in
the
near
future
in
short
the
law
governing
the
increase
of
producer
as
compared
to
consumer
goods
reflects
the
singular
nature
of
capitalist
society
as
a
whole
which
marx
had
not
understood
and
which
to
interpret
happily
fell
to
the
lot
of
tugan
baranovski
we
have
seen
above
the
decisive
part
played
by
the
law
of
capital
in
the
controversy
between
the
russian
marxists
and
the
sceptics
bulgakov
remarks
we
already
know
another
marxist
already
referred
to
vladimir
ilyin
expresses
himself
in
similar
terms
in
his
polemics
against
the
is
well
known
that
the
law
of
capitalist
production
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
constant
capital
grows
more
rapidly
than
the
variable
capital
that
is
to
say
an
ever
increasing
part
of
the
newly
formed
capital
falls
to
the
department
of
social
production
which
creates
producer
goods
in
consequence
this
department
is
absolutely
bound
to
grow
more
rapidly
than
the
department
creating
consumer
goods
that
is
to
say
the
very
thing
happens
which
sismondi
declared
to
be
impossible
dangerous
etc
in
consequence
consumer
goods
make
up
a
smaller
and
smaller
share
of
the
total
bulk
of
capitalist
production
and
this
is
entirely
in
accordance
with
the
historical
mission
of
capitalism
and
its
specific
social
structure
the
former
in
fact
consists
in
the
development
of
the
productive
forces
of
society
production
as
an
end
in
itself
and
the
latter
prevents
that
the
mass
of
the
population
should
turn
them
to
use
in
this
respect
of
course
tugan
baranovski
goes
even
farther
with
his
love
of
paradox
he
actually
permits
himself
the
joke
of
submitting
a
mathematical
proof
that
accumulation
of
capital
and
expansion
of
production
are
possible
even
if
the
absolute
volume
of
production
decreases
in
this
connection
karl
kautsky
has
pointed
out
he
had
recourse
to
a
somewhat
dubious
scientific
subterfuge
namely
that
he
shaped
his
daring
deductions
exclusively
for
a
specific
moment
the
transition
from
simple
to
enlarged
reproduction
a
moment
which
is
exceptional
even
in
theory
but
certainly
of
no
practical
significance
whatever
as
to
tugan
baranovski
law
kautsky
declares
it
to
be
a
mere
illusion
due
to
the
fact
that
tugan
baranovski
considered
the
organisation
of
production
only
in
the
old
countries
of
capitalist
big
industry
is
correct
kautsky
says
with
a
progressive
division
of
labour
there
will
be
comparatively
fewer
and
fewer
factories
etc
for
the
production
of
goods
direct
for
personal
consumption
together
with
a
relative
increase
in
the
number
of
those
which
supply
both
the
former
and
one
another
with
tools
machines
raw
materials
transport
facilities
and
so
on
while
in
original
peasant
economy
an
enterprise
that
cultivated
the
flax
also
made
the
linen
with
its
own
tools
and
got
it
ready
for
human
consumption
nowadays
hundreds
of
enterprises
may
share
in
the
manufacture
of
a
single
shirt
by
producing
raw
cotton
iron
rails
steam
engines
and
railway
trucks
that
bring
it
to
port
and
so
on
with
international
division
of
labour
it
will
happen
that
some
countries
the
old
industrial
countries
can
only
slowly
expand
their
production
for
personal
consumption
while
making
large
strides
in
their
production
of
producer
goods
which
is
much
more
decisive
for
the
heartbeat
of
economic
life
than
the
production
of
consumer
goods
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
nation
concerned
we
might
easily
form
the
opinion
that
producer
goods
can
be
turned
out
on
a
constantly
rising
scale
with
a
more
rapid
rate
of
increase
than
in
the
production
of
consumer
goods
and
that
their
production
is
not
bound
up
with
that
of
the
latter
the
opinion
that
producer
goods
can
be
produced
independent
of
consumption
is
of
course
a
mirage
of
tugan
baranovski
typical
of
vulgar
economics
not
so
the
fact
cited
in
support
of
this
fallacy
the
quicker
growth
of
department
i
as
compared
with
department
ii
is
beyond
dispute
not
only
in
old
industrial
countries
but
wherever
technical
progress
plays
a
decisive
part
in
production
it
is
the
foundation
also
of
marx
fundamental
law
that
the
rate
of
profit
tends
to
fall
yet
in
spite
of
it
all
or
rather
precisely
for
this
reason
it
is
a
howler
if
bulgakov
ilyin
and
tugan
baranovski
imagine
to
have
discovered
in
this
law
the
essential
nature
of
capitalist
economy
as
an
economic
system
in
which
production
is
an
end
in
itself
and
human
consumption
merely
incidental
the
growth
of
the
constant
at
the
expense
of
the
variable
capital
is
only
the
capitalist
expression
of
the
general
effects
of
increasing
labour
productivity
the
formula
greater
than
translated
from
the
language
of
capitalism
into
that
of
the
social
labour
process
means
only
that
the
higher
the
productivity
of
human
labour
the
shorter
the
time
needed
to
change
a
given
quantity
of
means
of
production
into
finished
products
this
is
a
universal
law
of
human
labour
it
has
been
valid
in
all
forms
of
production
and
will
also
be
valid
in
the
future
in
a
socialist
order
of
society
in
terms
of
the
material
of
society
aggregate
product
this
law
must
manifest
itself
by
more
and
more
social
labour
time
being
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
producer
than
of
consumer
goods
in
a
planned
and
controlled
social
economy
organised
on
socialist
lines
this
transformation
would
in
fact
be
more
rapid
even
than
it
is
in
contemporary
capitalist
economy
in
the
first
place
rational
scientific
techniques
can
only
be
applied
on
the
largest
scale
when
the
barriers
of
private
ownership
in
land
are
abolished
this
will
result
in
an
immense
revolution
in
vast
provinces
of
production
which
will
ultimately
amount
to
a
replacement
of
living
labour
by
machine
labour
and
which
will
enable
us
to
tackle
technical
jobs
on
a
scale
quite
impossible
under
present
day
conditions
secondly
the
general
use
of
machinery
in
the
productive
process
will
be
put
on
a
new
economic
basis
at
present
the
machine
does
not
compete
with
living
labour
but
only
with
that
part
of
it
that
is
paid
the
cost
of
the
labour
power
which
is
replaced
by
the
machine
represents
the
lowest
limit
of
the
applicability
of
the
machine
which
means
that
the
capitalist
becomes
interested
in
a
machine
only
when
the
costs
of
its
production
assuming
the
same
level
of
performance
amount
to
less
than
the
wages
of
the
workers
it
replaces
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
social
labour
process
which
is
the
only
one
to
matter
in
a
socialist
society
the
machine
competes
not
with
the
labour
that
is
necessary
to
maintain
the
worker
but
with
the
labour
he
actually
performs
in
other
words
in
a
society
that
is
not
governed
by
the
profit
motive
but
aims
at
saving
human
labour
the
use
of
machinery
is
economically
indicated
just
as
soon
as
it
can
save
more
human
labour
than
is
necessary
for
making
it
not
to
mention
the
many
cases
where
the
use
of
machinery
is
desirable
even
if
it
does
not
answer
this
economic
minimum
for
reasons
of
health
and
similar
considerations
in
the
interest
of
the
workers
themselves
however
that
may
be
the
tension
between
the
respective
economic
usefulness
of
the
machine
in
a
capitalist
and
a
socialist
society
is
at
least
equal
to
the
difference
between
labour
and
that
part
of
it
that
is
paid
it
is
in
other
words
the
precise
equivalent
of
the
whole
capitalist
surplus
value
consequently
if
the
capitalist
profit
motive
is
abolished
and
a
social
organisation
of
labour
introduced
the
marginal
use
of
the
machine
will
suddenly
be
increased
by
the
whole
extent
of
the
capitalist
surplus
value
so
that
an
enormous
field
not
to
be
gauged
as
yet
will
be
open
to
the
triumphal
march
of
the
machine
this
would
be
tangible
proof
that
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
alleged
to
spur
on
to
the
optimum
technical
development
in
fact
sets
large
social
limits
to
technical
progress
in
form
of
the
profit
motive
on
which
it
is
based
it
would
show
that
as
soon
as
these
limits
are
abolished
technical
progress
will
develop
such
a
powerful
drive
that
the
technical
marvels
of
capitalist
production
will
be
child
play
in
comparison
in
terms
of
the
composition
of
the
social
product
this
technical
transformation
can
only
mean
that
compared
to
the
production
of
consumer
goods
the
production
of
producer
goods
measured
in
units
of
labour
time
must
increase
more
rapidly
in
a
socialist
society
than
it
does
even
thus
the
relation
between
the
two
departments
of
social
production
which
the
russian
marxists
took
to
reveal
typical
capitalist
baseness
the
neglect
of
man
need
to
consume
rather
proves
to
be
the
precise
manifestation
of
the
progressive
subjection
of
nature
to
social
labour
which
will
become
even
more
striking
when
production
is
organised
solely
with
a
view
to
human
needs
the
only
objective
proof
for
tugan
baranovski
law
thus
collapses

that
consumption
is
bound
to
grow
and
the
precise
ratio
as
the
bulk
of

calls
for
two
comments
first
like
marx
kautsky
paid
no
attention
to
the
progress
in
the
productivity
of
labour
so
that
consumption
appears
to
have
a
relatively
larger
volume
than
it
would
in
fact
have
secondly
the
increase
in
consumption
to
which
kautsky
here
refers
is
only
a
consequence
a
result
of
enlarged
reproduction
it
is
neither
its
basis
nor
its
aim
it
is
mainly
due
to
the
growth
of
the
variable
capital
the
continual
employment
of
additional
workers
the
upkeep
of
these
workers
however
neither
is
nor
ought
to
be
the
object
of
the
expansion
of
reproduction
no
more
for
that
matter
than
the
increasing
personal
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
kautsky
argument
no
doubt
refutes
tugan
baranovski
pet
notion
the
whimsy
to
construe
enlarged
reproduction
with
an
absolute
decrease
in
consumption
but
for
all
that
he
does
not
get
anywhere
near
the
fundamental
problem
the
relations
between
production
and
consumption
under
the
aspect
of
the
reproductive
process
though
we
are
told
in
another
passage
of
the
same
work
the
capitalists
growing
richer
and
the
workers
they
exploit
increasing
in
numbers
they
constitute
between
them
a
market
for
the
consumer
goods
produced
by
capitalist
big
industry
which
expands
continually
yet
it
does
not
grow
as
rapidly
as
the
accumulation
of
capital
and
the
productivity
of
labour
and
must
therefore
remain
inadequate
an
additional
market
is
required
for
these
consumer
goods
a
market
outside
their
own
province
among
those
occupational
groups
and
nations
whose
mode
of
production
is
not
yet
capitalistic
this
market
is
found
and
also
widens
increasingly
but
the
expansion
is
again
too
slow
since
the
additional
market
is
not
nearly
so
elastic
and
capable
of
expansion
as
the
capitalist
productive
process
as
soon
as
capitalist
production
has
developed
to
the
big
industry
stage
as
in
england
already
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
capable
of
expanding
by
leaps
and
bounds
so
as
soon
to
all
expansions
of
the
market
every
period
of
prosperity
subsequent
to
a
considerable
extension
of
the
market
is
thus
from
the
outset
doomed
to
an
early
end
the
inevitable
crisis
this
in
brief
is
the
theory
of
crises
established
by
marx
and
as
far
as
we
can
see
generally
accepted
by
the
orthodox
marxists
kautsky
however
is
not
interested
in
harmonising
this
conception
of
the
realisation
of
the
aggregate
product
with
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
perhaps
because
as
our
quotation
also
shows
he
deals
with
the
problem
solely
from
the
aspect
of
crises
regarding
in
other
words
the
social
product
as
a
more
or
less
homogeneous
bulk
of
goods
and
ignoring
the
fact
that
it
is
differentiated
in
the
reproductive
process
bouding
seems
to
come
closer
to
the
crucial
point
in
his
brilliant
review
on
tugan
baranovski
he
gives
the
following
formulation
a
single
exception
to
be
considered
below
the
existence
of
a
surplus
product
in
capitalist
countries
does
not
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
of
production
not
because
production
will
be
distributed
more
efficiently
among
the
various
spheres
or
because
the
manufacture
of
machinery
will
replace
that
of
cotton
goods
the
reason
is
rather
that
capitalist
development
having
begun
sooner
in
some
countries
than
in
others
and
because
even
there
are
still
some
countries
that
have
no
developed
capitalism
the
capitalist
countries
in
truth
have
at
their
disposal
an
outside
market
in
which
they
can
get
rid
of
their
products
which
they
can
not
consume
themselves
no
matter
whether
these
are
cotton
or
iron
goods
we
would
by
no
means
deny
that
it
is
significant
if
iron
goods
replace
cotton
goods
as
the
main
products
of
the
principal
capitalist
countries
on
the
contrary
this
change
is
of
paramount
importance
but
its
implications
are
rather
different
from
those
ascribed
to
it
by
tugan
baranovski
it
indicates
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
capitalism
so
long
as
the
capitalist
countries
exported
commodities
for
the
purpose
of
consumption
there
was
still
a
hope
for
capitalism
in
these
countries
and
the
question
did
not
arise
how
much
and
how
long
the
outside
world
would
be
able
to
absorb
capitalist
commodities
the
growing
share
of
machinery
at
the
cost
of
consumer
goods
in
what
is
exported
from
the
main
capitalist
countries
shows
that
areas
which
were
formerly
free
of
capitalism
and
therefore
served
as
a
for
its
surplus
products
are
now
drawn
into
the
whirlpool
of
capitalism
it
shows
that
since
they
are
developing
a
capitalism
of
their
own
they
can
by
themselves
produce
the
consumer
goods
they
need
at
present
they
still
require
machinery
produced
by
capitalist
methods
since
they
are
only
in
the
initial
stages
of
capitalist
development
but
all
too
soon
they
will
need
them
no
longer
just
as
they
now
make
their
own
cotton
and
other
consumer
goods
they
will
in
future
produce
their
own
iron
ware
then
they
will
not
only
cease
to
absorb
the
surplus
produce
of
the
essentially
capitalist
countries
but
they
will
themselves
produce
surplus
products
which
they
can
place
only
with
difficulty

that

that
the

relative

is
a
delusion
of
tugan
baranovski
from
natural
conditions
such
as
fertility
of
the
soil
and
from
the
skill
of
independent
and
isolated
producers
shown
rather
qualitatively
in
the
genus
than
quantitatively
in
the
mass
of
their
products
the
degree
of
productivity
of
labour
in
a
capitalist
society
is
expressed
in
the
relative
extent
of
the
means
of
production
that
one

during
a

tension

he
thus
transforms

those
means
of

play
a
double

in

with
the
use

raw

worked
up
in

therefore
a
greater
mass
of
raw
material
and
auxiliary

enter
into
the
that
is
the
consequence
of
the
increasing
productivity
of

other
hand
the

a
condition

so
also
is
it
with

the
end
of

the
russian
marxists
and
tugan
baranovski
above
all
can
claim
the
credit
in
their
struggle
against
the
doubters
of
capitalist
accumulation
of
having
enriched
economic
theory
by
an
application
of
marx
analysis
of
the
social
reproductive
process
and
its
schematic
representation
in
the
second
volume
of

in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
same
tugan
baranovski
quite
wrongly
regarded
said
diagram
as
the
solution
to
the
problem
instead
of
its
formulation
his
conclusions
were
bound
to
reverse
the
basic
order
of
marx
doctrine
tugan
baranovski
approach
according
to
which
capitalist
production
can
create
unlimited
markets
and
is
independent
of
consumption
leads
him
straight
on
to
the
thesis
of
a
natural
balance
between
production
and
consumption
between
supply
and
demand
the
difference
is
simply
that
those
two
only
thought
in
terms
of
simple
commodity
circulation
whilst
tugan
baranovski
applies
the
same
doctrine
to
the
circulation
of
capital
his
theory
of
crises
being
caused
by
a
of
proportion
is
in
effect
just
a
paraphrase
of
say
old
trite
absurdity
the
of
any
one
commodity
only
goes
to
show
of
another
and
tugan
baranovski
simply
translates
this
nonsense
into
the
terminology
used
in
marx
analysis
of
the
reproductive
process
even
though
he
declares
that
say
notwithstanding
general
is
quite
possible
in
the
light
of
the
circulation
of
money
which
the
former
had
entirely
neglected
yet
it
is
in
fact
this
very

neglect
the
besetting
sin
of

ricardo
in
their
dealings
with
the

in

compound
of
forms
of
thought
borrowed
from

with
contents
derived
from

ricardo
is
what
tugan
baranovski
modestly
calls
his
at
a
synthesis
between
marx
theory
and
classical
economics
after
almost
a
century
the
theory
of
optimism
which
holds
in
the
face
of
doubts
that
capitalist

is
capable

by

its

baranovski
overstated
their
case
the
question
was
whether
capitalism
in
general
and
russian
capitalism
in
particular
is
capable
of
development
these
marxists
however
proved
this
capacity
to
the
extent
of
even
offering
theoretical
proof
that
capitalism
can
go
on
for
ever
assuming
the
accumulation
of
capital
to
be
without
limits
one
has
obviously
proved
the
unlimited
capacity
of
capitalism
to
survive
accumulation
is
the
specifically
capitalist
method
of
expanding
production
of
furthering
labour
productivity
of
developing
the
productive
forces
of

progress
if
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
can
ensure
boundless
expansion
of
the

it
is
invincible
indeed
the
most

of

declining

finally
cut
away
the
ground
from

somewhat
precarious
comfort
forgetting
the
straw
he
had
offered
for
the
salvation
of

turned
on

with
the
teaching
that
in

the
relative
decline
in

is
compensated
by
the
absolute

that
it
would
use
the
capitalised
surplus
value
exclusively
for
its
own
needs
this
impression
is
confirmed
by
marx
analysis
of
the
diagram
where
he
attempts
to
reduce
the
circulation
within
the
diagram
altogether
to
terms
of
money
that
is
to
say
to
the
effective
demand
of
capitalists
and
workers
an
attempt
which
in
the
end
leads
him
to
introduce
the
of
money
as
a
ex
in
addition
there
is
that
most
important
passage
in
volume
i
which
must
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
same
annual
production
must
in
the
first
place
furnish
all
those
objects
from
which
the
material
components
of
capital
used
up
in
the
course
of
the
year
have
to
be
replaced
deducting
these
there
remains
the
net
or
in
which
the
lies
and
of
what
does
this
consist
only
of
things
destined
to
satisfy
the
wants
and
desires
of
the
capitalist
class
things
which
consequently
enter
into
the
consumption
fund
of
the
capitalists
were
that
the
case
the
cup
of
would
be
drained
to
the
very
dregs
and
nothing
but
simple
reproduction
would
ever
take
place
accumulate
it
is
necessary
to
convert
a
portion
of
the
into
capital
but
we
can
not
except
by
a
miracle
convert
into
capital
anything
but
such
articles
as
can
be
employed
in
the
means
of
production
and
such
further
articles
as
are
suitable
for
the
sustenance
of
the
labourer
means
of
subsistence
consequently
a
part
of
the
annual
must
have
been
applied
to
the
production
of
additional
means
of
production
and
subsistence
over
and
above
the
quantity
of
these
things
required
to
replace
the
capital
advanced
in
one
word
is
convertible
into
capital
solely
because
the
whose
value
it
is
already
comprises
the
material
elements
of
new
capital
the
following
conditions
of
accumulation
are
here
laid
down
the
surplus
value
to
be
capitalised
first
comes
into
being
in
the
natural
form
of
capital
as
additional
means
of
production
and
additional
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
the
expansion
of
capitalist
production
is
achieved
exclusively
by
means
of
capitalist
products
its
own
means
of
production
and
subsistence
the
limits
of
this
expansion
are
each
time
determined
in
advance
by
the
amount
of
surplus
value
which
is
to
be
capitalised
in
any
given
case
they
can
not
be
extended
since
they
depend
on
the
amount
of
the
means
of
production
and
subsistence
which
make
up
the
surplus
product
neither
can
they
be
reduced
since
a
part
of
the
surplus
value
could
not
then
be
employed
in
its
natural
form
deviations
in
either
direction
above
and
below
may
give
rise
to
periodical
fluctuations
and
crises
in
this
context
however
these
may
be
ignored
because
in
general
the
surplus
product
to
be
capitalised
must
be
equal
to
actual
accumulation
since
capitalist
production
buys
up
its
entire
surplus
product
there
is
no
limit
to
the
accumulation
of
capital
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
adheres
to
these
conditions
accumulation
here
takes
its
course
but
it
is
not
in
the
least
indicated
who
is
to
benefit
by
it
who
are
the
new
consumers
for
whose
sake
production
is
ever
more
enlarged
the
diagram
assumes
say
the
following
course
of
events
the
coal
industry
is
expanded
in
order
to
expand
the
iron
industry
in
order
to
expand
the
machine
industry
in
order
to
expand
the
production
of
consumer
goods
this
last
in
turn
is
expanded
to
maintain
both
its
own
workers
and
the
growing
army
of
coal
iron
and
machine
operatives
and
so
on
we
are
running
in
circles
quite
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
tugan
baranovski
considered
in
isolation
marx
diagram
does
indeed
permit
of
such
an
interpretation
since
he
himself
explicitly
states
time
and
again
that
he
aims
at
presenting
the
process
of
accumulation
of
the
aggregate
capital
in
a
society
consisting
solely
of
capitalists
and
workers
passages
to
this
effect
can
be
found
in
every
volume
of
in
volume
i
in
the
very
chapter
on
conversion
of
into
capital
he
says
order
to
examine
the
object
of
our
investigation
in
its
integrity
free
from
all
disturbing
subsidiary
circumstances
we
must
treat
the
whole
world
as
one
nation
and
assume
that
capitalist
production
is
everywhere
established
and
has
possessed
itself
of
every
branch
of
industry
in
volume
ii
the
assumption
repeatedly
returns
thus
in
chapter
on
circulation
of
there
are
only
two
points
of
departure
the
capitalist
and
the
labourer
all
third
classes
of
persons
must
either
receive
money
for
their
services
from
these
two
classes
or
to
the
extent
that
they
receive
it
without
any
equivalent
services
they
are
joint
owners
of
the
in
the
form
of
rent
interest
etc
the
capitalist
class
then
remains
the
sole
point
of
departure
of
the
circulation
of
money
further
in
the
same
chapter
the
circulation
of
money
in
particular
under
assumption
of
accumulation
the
difficulty
arises
when
we
assume
not
a
partial
but
a
general
accumulation
of
on
the
part
of
the
capitalist
class
apart
from
this
class
there
is
according
to
our
assumption
the
general
and
exclusive
domination
of
capitalist
production
no
other
class
but
the
working
class
and
again
in
chapter
there
are
only
two
classes
in
this
case
the
working
class
disposing
of
their
and
the
capitalist
class
owning
the
social
means
of
production
and
the
money
in
volume
iii
marx
says
quite
explicitly
when
demonstrating
the
process
of
capitalist
production
as
a
whole
us
suppose
that
the
whole
society
is
composed
only
of
industrial
capitalists
and
wage
workers
let
us
furthermore
make
exceptions
of
fluctuations
of
prices
which
prevent
large
portions
of
the
total
capital
from
reproducing
themselves
under
average
conditions
and
which
owing
to
the
general
interrelations
of
the
entire
process
of
reproduction
such
as
are
developed
particularly
by
credit
must
always
call
forth
general
stoppages
of
a
transient
nature
let
us
also
make
abstraction
of
the
bogus
transactions
and
speculations
which
the
credit
system
favours
in
that
case
a
crisis
could
be
explained
only
by
a
disproportion
of
production
in
various
branches
and
by
a
disproportion
of
the
consumption
of
the
capitalists
and
the
accumulation
of
their
capitals
but
as
matters
stand
the
reproduction
of
the
capitals
invested
in
production
depends
largely
upon
the
consuming
power
of
the
classes
while
the
consuming
power
of
the
labourers
is
handicapped
partly
by
the
laws
of
wages
partly
by
the
fact
that
it
can
be
exerted
only
so
long
as
the
labourers
can
be
employed
at
a
profit
for
the
capitalist
class
this
last
quotation
refers
to
the
question
of
crises
with
which
we
are
not
here
concerned
it
can
leave
no
doubt
however
that
the
movement
of
the
total
capital
matters
stand
depends
in
marx
view
on
three
categories
of
consumers
only
the
capitalists
the
workers
and
the
classes
the
of
the
capitalist
class
king
parson
professor
prostitute
mercenary
of
whom
he
quite
rightly
disposes
in
volume
ii
as
the
mere
representatives
of
a
derivative
purchasing
power
and
thus
the
parasitic
joint
consumers
of
the
surplus
value
or
of
the
wage
of
labour
finally
in
of
surplus
marx
formulates
his
general
presuppositions
with
regard
to
accumulation
as
follows
we
have
only
to
consider
the
forms
through
which
capital
passes
during
the
various
stages
of
its
development
thus
we
do
not
set
out
the
actual
conditions
of
the
real
process
of
production
but
always
assume
that
the
commodity
is
sold
for
what
it
is
worth
we
ignore
the
competition
of
capitalists
and
the
credit
system
we
also
leave
out
of
account
the
actual
constitution
of
society
which
never
consists
exclusively
of
the
classes
of
workers
and
industrial
capitalists
and
where
there
is
accordingly
no
strict
division
between
producers
and
consumers
the
first
category
of
consumers
whose
revenues
are
partly
of
a
secondary
not
a
primitive
nature
derived
from
profits
and
the
wage
of
labour
is
much
wider
than
the
second
category
of
producers
therefore
the
manner
in
which
it
spends
its
income
and
the
extent
of
such
income
effects
very
large
modifications
in
the
economic
household
and
especially
so
in
the
process
of
circulation
and
reproduction
of
capital
speaking
of
the
constitution
of
society
marx
here
also
considers
merely
the
parasitic
joint
consumers
of
surplus
value
and
of
the
wage
of
labour
only
the
of
the
principal
categories
of
capitalist
production
there
can
be
no
doubt
therefore
that
marx
wanted
to
demonstrate
the
process
of
accumulation
in
a
society
consisting
exclusively
of
workers
and
capitalists
under
the
universal
and
exclusive
domination
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
on
this
assumption
however
his
diagram
does
not
permit
of
any
other
interpretation
than
that
of
production
for
production
sake
let
us
recall
the
second
example
of
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
year
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
year
i
means

means

subsistence
year
i
means
of

ii
means

year
i
means

production
ii
means
of
subsistence
here
accumulation
continues
year
after
year
without
interruption
the
capitalists
in
each
case
consuming
half
of
the
surplus
value
they
have
gained
and
capitalising
the
other
half
in
the
process
of
capitalisation
the
same
technical
foundation
that
is
to
say
the
same
organic
composition
or
division
into
constant
and
variable
capital
and
also
the
same
rate
of
exploitation
always
amounting
to
per
cent
is
consecutively
maintained
for
the
additional
capital
as
it
was
for
the
original
capital
in
accordance
with
marx
assumption
in
volume
i
of
the
capitalised
part
of
the
surplus
value
first
comes
into
being
as
additional
means
of
production
and
as
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
both
serving
the
purpose
of
an
ever
expanding
production
in
the
two
departments
it
can
not
be
discovered
from
the
assumptions
of
marx
diagram
for
whose
sake
production
is
progressively
expanded
admittedly
production
and
consumption
increase
simultaneously
in
a
society
the
consumption
of
the
capitalists
increases
in
terms
of
value
in
the
first
year
it
amounts
to
in
the
second
year
to
in
the
third
year
to
and
in
the
fourth
year
to
the
consumption
of
the
workers
increases
as
well
the
variable
capital
increasing
year
after
year
in
both
departments
precisely
indicates
this
growth
in
terms
of
value
and
yet
the
growing
consumption
of
the
capitalists
can
certainly
not
be
regarded
as
the
ultimate
purpose
of
accumulation
on
the
contrary
there
is
no
accumulation
inasmuch
as
this
consumption
takes
place
and
increases
personal
consumption
of
the
capitalists
must
be
regarded
as
simple
reproduction
rather
the
question
is
if
and
in
so
far
as
the
capitalists
do
not
themselves
consume
their
products
but
abstinence
accumulate
for
whose
sake
do
they
produce
even
less
can
the
maintenance
of
an
ever
larger
army
of
workers
be
the
ultimate
purpose
of
continuous
accumulation
of
capital
from
the
point
of
view
the
consumption
of
the
workers
is
a
consequence
of
accumulation
it
is
never
its
object
or
its
condition
unless
the
principles
foundations
of
capitalist
production
are
to
be
turned
upside
down
and
in
any
case
the
workers
can
only
consume
that
part
of
the
product
which
corresponds
to
the
variable
capital
not
a
jot
more
who
then
realises
the
permanently
increasing
surplus
value
the
diagram
answers
the
capitalists
themselves
and
they
and
what
do
they
do
with
this
increasing
surplus
value
the
diagram
replies
they
use
it
for
an
ever
greater
expansion
of
their
production
these
capitalists
are
thus
fanatical
supporters
of
an
expansion
of
production
for
production
sake
they
see
to
it
that
ever
more
machines
are
built
for
the
sake
of
building
with
their
help
ever
more
new
machines
yet
the
upshot
of
all
this
is
not
accumulation
of
capital
but
an
increasing
production
of
producer
goods
to
no
purpose
whatever
indeed
one
must
be
as
reckless
as
tugan
baranovski
and
rejoice
as
much
in
paradoxical
statements
to
assume
that
this
untiring
in
thin
air
could
be
a
faithful
reflection
in
theory
of
capitalist
reality
a
true
deduction
from
marx
doctrine
besides
the
analysis
of
enlarged
reproduction
roughed
out
in
volume
ii
the
whole
of
marx
work
volume
ii
in
particular
contains
a
most
elaborate
and
lucid
exposition
of
his
general
views
regarding
the
typical
course
of
capitalist
accumulation
if
we
once
fully
understand
this
interpretation
the
deficiencies
of
the
diagram
at
the
end
of
volume
ii
are
immediately
evident
if
we
examine
critically
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
in
the
light
of
marx
theory
we
find
various
contradictions
between
the
two
to
begin
with
the
diagram
completely
disregards
the
increasing
productivity
of
labour
for
it
assumes
that
the
composition
of
capital
is
the
same
in
every
year
that
is
to
say
the
technical
basis
of
the
productive
process
is
not
affected
by
accumulation
this
procedure
would
be
quite
permissible
in
itself
in
order
to
simplify
the
analysis
but
when
we
come
to
examine
the
concrete
conditions
for
the
realisation
of
the
aggregate
product
and
for
reproduction
then
at
least
we
must
take
into
account
and
make
allowance
for
changes
in
technique
which
are
bound
up
with
the
process
of
capital
accumulation
yet
if
we
allow
for
improved
productivity
of
labour
the
material
aggregate
of
the
social
product
both
producer
and
consumer
goods
will
in
consequence
show
a
much
more
rapid
increase
in
volume
than
is
set
forth
in
the
diagram
this
increase
in
the
aggregate
of
moreover
indicates
also
a
change
in
the
value
relationships
as
marx
argues
so
convincingly
basing
his
whole
theory
on
this
axiom
the
progressive
development
of
labour
productivity
reacts
on
both
the
composition
of
accumulating
capital
and
the
rate
of
surplus
value
so
that
they
can
not
remain
constant
under
conditions
of
increasing
accumulation
of
capital
as
was
assumed
by
the
diagram
rather
if
accumulation
continues
the
constant
capital
of
both
departments
must
increase
not
only
absolutely
but
also
relatively
to
or
the
total
new
value
the
social
aspect
of
labour
productivity
at
the
same
time
constant
capital
and
similarly
the
surplus
value
must
increase
relatively
to
the
variable
capital
in
short
the
rate
of
surplus
value
the
ratio
between
surplus
value
and
variable
capital
must
similarly
increase
the
capitalist
aspect
of
labour
productivity
these
changes
need
not
of
course
occur
annually
just
as
the
terms
of
first
second
and
third
year
in
marx
diagram
do
not
necessarily
refer
to
calendar
years
but
may
stand
for
any
given
period
finally
we
may
choose
to
assume
that
these
alterations
both
in
the
composition
of
capital
and
in
the
rate
of
surplus
value
take
place
either
in
the
first
third
fifth
seventh
year
or
in
the
second
sixth
and
ninth
year
etc
the
important
thing
is
only
that
they
are
allowed
for
somewhere
and
taken
into
account
as
periodical
phenomena
if
the
diagram
is
amended
accordingly
the
result
of
this
method
of
accumulation
will
be
an
increasing
annual
surplus
in
the
consumer
at
the
expense
of
producer
goods
it
is
true
that
tugan
baranovski
conquers
all
difficulties
on
paper
he
simply
constructs
a
diagram
with
different
proportions
where
year
by
year
the
variable
capital
decreases
by
per
cent
and
since
this
arithmetical
exercise
is
successful
enough
on
paper
tugan
triumphantly
claims
to
have
that
accumulation
runs
smoothly
like
clockwork
even
if
the
absolute
volume
of
consumption
decreases
even
he
must
admit
in
the
end
however
that
his
assumption
of
such
an
absolute
decrease
of
the
variable
capital
is
in
striking
contrast
to
reality
variable
capital
is
in
point
of
fact
a
growing
quantity
in
all
capitalist
countries
only
in
relation
to
the
even
more
rapid
growth
of
constant
capital
can
it
be
said
to
decrease
on
the
basis
of
what
is
actually
happening
namely
a
greater
yearly
increase
of
constant
capital
as
against
that
of
variable
capital
as
well
as
a
growing
rate
of
surplus
value
discrepancies
must
arise
between
the
material
composition
of
the
social
product
and
the
composition
of
capital
in
terms
of
value
if
instead
of
the
unchanging
proportion
of
to
between
constant
and
variable
capital
proposed
by
marx
diagram
we
assume
for
instance
that
this
increase
of
capital
is
accompanied
by
a
progressive
readjustment
of
its
composition
the
proportion
between
constant
and
variable
in
the
second
year
being
to
in
the
third
year
to
and
in
the
fourth
year
to
if
we
further
assume
that
the
rate
of
surplus
value
also
increases
progressively
in
accordance
with
the
higher
productivity
of
labour
so
that
in
each
case
we
have
the
same
amounts
as
those
of
the
diagram
although
because
of
the
relatively
decreasing
variable
capital
the
rate
of
surplus
value
does
not
remain
constant
at
the
original
per
cent
and
if
finally
we
assume
that
of
the
appropriated
surplus
value
is
capitalised
in
each
case
excepting
department
ii
where
capitalisation
exceeds
per
cent
out
of
being
capitalised
during
the
first
year
the
result
will
be
as
follows
year
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
year
i
c
v
means
of
production
ii
c
v
means
of
subsistence
year
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
year
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
if
this
were
a
true
picture
of
the
accumulative
process
the
means
of
production
constant
capital
would
show
a
deficit
of
in
the
second
year
of
in
the
third
year
and
of
in
the
fourth
year
similarly
the
means
of
subsistence
would
show
a
surplus
of
in
the
second
year
of
in
the
third
year
and
of
in
the
fourth
year
this
negative
balance
for
the
means
of
production
may
be
only
imaginary
in
part
the
increasing
productivity
of
labour
ensures
that
the
means
of
production
grow
faster
in
bulk
than
in
value
in
other
words
means
of
production
become
cheaper
as
it
is
use
value
the
material
elements
of
capital
which
is
relevant
for
technical
improvements
of
production
we
may
assume
that
the
quantity
of
means
of
production
in
spite
of
their
lower
value
will
suffice
for
progressive
accumulation
up
to
a
certain
point
this
phenomenon
amongst
others
also
checks
the
actual
decline
of
the
rate
of
profit
and
modifies
it
to
a
mere
tendency
though
our
example
shows
that
the
decline
of
the
profit
rate
would
not
only
be
retarded
but
rather
completely
arrested
on
the
other
hand
the
same
fact
indicates
a
much
larger
surplus
of
unsaleable
means
of
subsistence
than
is
suggested
by
the
amount
of
this
surplus
in
terms
of
value
in
that
case
we
should
have
to
compel
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
to
consume
this
surplus
themselves
which
marx
makes
them
do
on
other
occasions
in
which
case
and
in
so
far
as
those
capitalists
are
concerned
there
would
again
be
no
accumulation
but
rather
simple
reproduction
alternatively
we
should
have
to
pronounce
this
whole
surplus
unsaleable
yet
would
it
not
be
very
easy
to
make
good
this
loss
in
means
of
production
which
results
from
our
example
we
need
only
assume
that
the
capitalists
of
department
i
capitalise
their
surplus
value
to
a
greater
extent
indeed
there
is
no
valid
reason
to
suppose
as
marx
did
that
the
capitalists
in
each
case
add
only
half
their
surplus
value
to
their
capital
advances
in
labour
productivity
may
well
lead
to
progressively
increasing
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
this
assumption
is
the
more
permissible
in
that
the
cheapening
of
consumer
goods
for
the
capitalist
class
too
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
technological
progress
the
relative
decrease
in
the
value
of
consumable
income
as
compared
with
the
capitalised
part
may
then
permit
of
the
same
or
even
a
higher
standard
of
living
for
this
class
we
might
for
instance
make
good
the
deficit
in
producer
goods
by
transferring
a
corresponding
part
of
surplus
value
i
to
the
constant
capital
of
this
department
a
part
which
would
otherwise
be
consumed
since
this
surplus
value
like
all
other
products
of
the
department
originally
takes
the
form
of
producer
goods
would
then
be
transferred
in
the
second
year
in
the
third
year
and
in
the
fourth
year
the
solution
of
one
difficulty
however
only
adds
to
another
it
goes
without
saying
that
if
the
capitalists
of
department
i
relatively
restrict
their
consumption
for
purposes
of
accumulation
there
will
be
a
proportionately
greater
unsaleable
residue
of
consumer
goods
in
department
ii
and
thus
it
becomes
more
and
more
impossible
to
enlarge
the
constant
capital
even
on
its
previous
technological
basis
if
the
capitalists
in
department
i
relatively
restrict
their
consumption
the
capitalists
of
department
ii
must
relatively
expand
their
personal
consumption
in
proportion
the
assumption
of
accelerated
accumulation
in
department
i
would
then
have
to
be
supplemented
by
that
of
retarded
accumulation
in
department
ii
technical
progress
in
one
department
by
regression
in
the
other
these
results
are
not
due
to
mere
chance
the
adjustments
we
have
tried
out
on
marx
diagram
are
merely
meant
to
illustrate
that
technical
progress
as
he
himself
admits
must
be
accompanied
by
a
relative
growth
of
constant
as
against
variable
capital
hence
the
necessity
for
a
continuous
revision
of
the
ratio
in
which
capitalised
surplus
value
should
be
allotted
to
and
respectively
in
marx
diagram
however
the
capitalists
are
in
no
position
to
make
these
allocations
at
will
since
the
material
form
of
their
surplus
value
predetermines
the
forms
of
capitalisation
since
according
to
marx
assumption
all
expansion
of
production
proceeds
exclusively
by
means
of
its
own
capitalistically
produced
means
of
production
and
subsistence
since
there
are
here
no
other
places
and
forms
of
production
and
equally
no
other
consumers
than
the
two
departments
with
their
capitalists
and
workers
and
since
on
the
other
hand
the
smooth
working
of
the
accumulative
process
depends
on
that
circulation
should
wholly
absorb
the
aggregate
product
of
both
departments
the
technological
shape
of
enlarged
reproduction
is
in
consequence
strictly
prescribed
by
the
material
form
of
the
surplus
product
in
other
words
according
to
marx
diagram
the
technical
organisation
of
expanded
production
can
and
must
be
such
as
to
make
use
of
the
aggregate
surplus
value
produced
in
departments
i
and
ii
in
this
connection
we
must
bear
in
mind
also
that
both
departments
can
obtain
their
respective
elements
of
production
only
by
means
of
mutual
exchange
thus
the
allocation
to
constant
or
variable
capital
of
the
surplus
value
earmarked
for
capitalisation
as
well
as
the
allotment
of
the
additional
means
of
production
and
subsistence
for
the
workers
to
departments
i
and
ii
is
given
in
advance
and
determined
by
the
relations
between
the
two
departments
of
the
diagram
both
in
material
and
in
terms
of
value
these
relations
themselves
however
reflect
a
quite
determinate
technical
organisation
of
production
this
implies
that
on
the
assumptions
of
marx
diagram
the
techniques
of
production
given
in
each
case
predetermine
the
techniques
of
the
subsequent
periods
of
enlarged
reproduction
if
accumulation
continues
assuming
that
is
to
say
in
accordance
with
marx
diagram
that
the
expansion
of
capitalist
production
is
always
performed
by
means
of
the
surplus
value
originally
produced
in
form
of
capital
and
further
or
rather
conversely
that
accumulation
in
one
department
is
strictly
dependent
on
accumulation
in
the
other
then
no
change
in
the
technical
organisation
of
production
can
be
possible
in
so
far
as
the
relation
of
to
is
concerned
we
may
put
our
point
in
yet
another
way
it
is
clear
that
a
quicker
growth
of
constant
as
compared
with
variable
capital
the
progressive
metamorphosis
of
the
organic
composition
of
capital
must
take
the
material
form
of
faster
expansion
of
production
in
department
i
as
against
production
in
department
ii
yet
marx
diagram
where
strict
conformity
of
the
two
departments
is
axiomatic
precludes
any
such
fluctuations
in
the
rate
of
accumulation
in
either
department
it
is
quite
legitimate
to
suppose
that
under
the
technical
conditions
of
progressive
accumulation
society
would
invest
ever
increasing
portions
of
the
surplus
value
earmarked
for
accumulation
in
department
i
rather
than
in
department
ii
both
departments
being
only
branches
of
the
same
social
production
supplementary
enterprises
if
you
like
of
the
capitalist
such
a
progressive
transfer
for
technical
reasons
from
one
department
to
the
other
of
a
part
of
the
accumulated
surplus
value
would
be
wholly
feasible
especially
as
it
corresponds
to
the
actual
practice
of
capital
yet
this
assumption
is
possible
only
so
long
as
we
envisage
the
surplus
value
earmarked
for
capitalisation
purely
in
terms
of
value
the
diagram
however
implies
that
this
part
of
the
surplus
value
appears
in
a
definite
material
form
which
prescribes
its
capitalisation
thus
the
surplus
value
of
department
ii
exists
as
means
of
subsistence
and
since
it
is
as
such
to
be
only
realised
by
department
i
this
intended
transfer
of
part
of
the
capitalised
surplus
value
from
department
ii
to
department
i
is
ruled
out
first
because
the
material
form
of
this
surplus
value
is
obviously
useless
to
department
i
and
secondly
because
of
the
relations
of
exchange
between
the
two
departments
which
would
in
turn
necessitate
an
equivalent
transfer
of
the
products
of
department
i
into
department
ii
it
is
therefore
downright
impossible
to
achieve
a
faster
expansion
of
department
i
as
against
department
ii
within
the
limits
of
diagram
however
we
may
regard
the
technological
alterations
of
the
mode
of
production
in
the
course
of
accumulation
they
can
not
be
accomplished
without
upsetting
the
fundamental
relations
of
marx
diagram
and
further
according
to
marx
diagram
the
capitalised
surplus
value
is
in
each
case
immediately
and
completely
absorbed
by
the
productive
process
of
the
following
period
for
apart
from
the
portion
earmarked
for
consumption
it
has
a
natural
form
which
allows
of
only
one
particular
kind
of
employment
the
diagram
precludes
the
cashing
and
hoarding
of
surplus
value
in
monetary
form
as
capital
waiting
to
be
invested
the
free
monetary
forms
of
private
capital
in
marx
view
are
first
the
money
deposited
gradually
against
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
fixed
capital
for
its
eventual
renewal
and
secondly
those
amounts
of
money
which
represent
realised
surplus
value
but
are
still
too
small
for
investment
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
aggregate
capital
both
these
sources
of
free
money
capital
are
negligible
for
if
we
assume
that
even
a
portion
of
the
social
surplus
value
is
realised
in
monetary
form
for
purposes
of
future
investment
then
at
once
the
question
arises
who
has
bought
the
material
items
of
this
surplus
value
and
who
has
provided
the
money
if
the
answer
is
other
capitalists
of
course
then
seeing
that
the
capitalist
class
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
the
two
departments
this
portion
of
the
surplus
value
must
also
be
regarded
as
invested
as
employed
in
the
productive
process
and
so
we
are
back
at
immediate
and
complete
investment
of
the
surplus
value
or
does
the
freezing
of
one
part
of
the
surplus
value
in
monetary
form
in
the
hands
of
certain
capitalists
mean
that
other
capitalists
will
be
left
with
a
corresponding
part
of
that
surplus
product
in
its
material
form
does
the
hoarding
of
realised
surplus
value
by
some
imply
that
others
are
no
longer
able
to
realise
their
surplus
value
since
the
capitalists
are
the
only
buyers
of
surplus
value
this
would
mean
however
that
the
smooth
course
of
reproduction
and
similarly
of
accumulation
as
described
in
the
diagram
would
be
interrupted
the
result
would
be
a
crisis
due
not
to
but
to
a
mere
intention
to
accumulate
the
kind
of
crisis
envisaged
by
sismondi
in
one
passage
of
his
marx
explains
in
so
many
words
that
he
not
at
all
concerned
in
this
connection
with
an
accumulation
of
capital
greater
than
can
be
used
in
the
productive
process
and
might
lie
idle
in
the
banks
in
monetary
form
with
the
consequence
of
lending
abroad
marx
refers
these
phenomena
to
the
section
on
competition
yet
it
is
important
to
establish
that
his
diagram
veritably
precludes
the
formation
of
such
additional
capital
competition
however
wide
we
may
make
the
concept
obviously
can
not
create
values
nor
can
it
create
capitals
which
are
not
themselves
the
result
of
the
reproductive
process
the
diagram
thus
precludes
the
expansion
of
production
by
leaps
and
bounds
it
only
allows
of
a
gradual
expansion
which
keeps
strictly
in
step
with
the
formation
of
the
surplus
value
and
is
based
upon
the
identity
between
realisation
and
capitalisation
of
the
surplus
value
for
the
same
reason
the
diagram
presumes
an
accumulation
which
affects
both
departments
equally
and
therefore
all
branches
of
capitalist
production
it
precludes
expansion
of
the
demand
by
leaps
and
bounds
just
as
much
as
it
prevents
a
or
precocious
development
of
individual
branches
of
capitalist
production
thus
the
diagram
assumes
a
movement
of
the
aggregate
capital
which
flies
in
the
face
of
the
actual
course
of
capitalist
development
at
first
sight
two
facts
are
typical
for
the
history
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
on
the
one
hand
the
periodical
expansion
of
the
whole
field
of
production
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
on
the
other
an
extremely
unequal
development
of
the
different
branches
of
production
the
history
of
the
english
cotton
industry
from
the
first
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
to
the
seventies
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
most
characteristic
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
appears
quite
inexplicable
from
the
point
of
view
of
marx
diagram
finally
the
diagram
contradicts
the
conception
of
the
capitalist
total
process
and
its
course
as
laid
down
by
marx
in
volume
iii
this
conception
is
based
on
the
inherent
contradiction
between
the
unlimited
expansive
capacity
of
the
productive
forces
and
the
limited
expansive
capacity
of
social
consumption
under
conditions
of
capitalist
distribution
let
us
see
how
marx
describes
this
contradiction
in
detail
in
chapter
on
the
internal
contradictions
of
the
of
the
declining
profit
rate
creation
of
assuming
the
necessary
means
of
production
or
sufficient
accumulation
of
capital
to
be
existing
finds
no
other
limit
but
the
labouring
population
when
the
rate
of
that
is
the
intensity
of
exploitation
is
given
and
no
other
limit
but
the
intensity
of
exploitation
when
the
labouring
population
is
given
and
the
capitalist
process
of
production
consists
essentially
of
the
production
of
materialised
in
the
which
is
that
aliquot
portion
of
the
produced
commodities
in
which
unpaid
labour
is
materialised
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
production
of
this
and
the
of
a
portion
of
it
into
capital
or
accumulation
forms
an
indispensable
part
of
this
production
of
is
the
immediate
purpose
and
the
compelling
motive
of
capitalist
production
it
will
not
do
to
represent
capitalist
production
as
something
which
it
is
not
that
is
to
say
as
a
production
having
for
its
immediate
purpose
the
consumption
of
goods
or
the
production
of
means
of
enjoyment
for
the
capitalists
and
of
course
even
less
for
the
worker
this
would
be
overlooking
the
specific
character
of
capitalist
production
which
reveals
itself
in
its
innermost
essence
the
creation
of
this
is
the
object
of
the
direct
process
of
production
and
this
process
has
no
other
limits
than
those
mentioned
above
as
soon
as
the
available
quantity
of
has
been
materialised
in
commodities
has
been
produced
but
this
production
of
is
but
the
first
act
of
the
capitalist
process
of
production
it
merely
terminates
the
act
of
direct
production
capital
has
absorbed
so
much
unpaid
labour
with
the
development
of
the
process
which
expresses
itself
through
a
falling
tendency
of
the
rate
of
profit
the
mass
of
thus
produced
is
swelled
to
immense
dimensions
now
comes
the
second
act
of
the
process
the
entire
mass
of
commodities
the
total
product
which
contains
a
portion
which
is
to
reproduce
the
constant
and
variable
capital
as
well
as
a
portion
representing
must
be
sold
if
this
is
not
done
or
only
partly
accomplished
or
only
at
prices
which
are
below
the
prices
of
production
the
labourer
has
been
none
the
less
exploited
but
his
exploitation
does
not
realise
as
much
for
the
capitalist
it
may
yield
no
at
all
for
him
or
only
realise
a
portion
of
the
produced
or
it
may
even
mean
a
partial
or
complete
loss
of
his
capital
the
conditions
of
direct
exploitation
and
those
of
the
realisation
of
are
not
identical
they
are
separated
logically
as
well
as
by
time
and
space
the
first
are
only
limited
by
the
productive
power
of
society
the
last
by
the
proportional
relations
of
the
various
lines
of
production
and
by
the
consuming
power
of
society
this
power
is
not
determined
either
by
the
absolute
productive
power
or
by
the
absolute
consuming
power
but
by
the
consuming
power
based
on
antagonistic
conditions
of
distribution
which
reduces
the
consumption
of
the
great
mass
of
the
population
to
a
variable
minimum
within
more
or
less
narrow
limits
the
consuming
power
is
furthermore
restricted
by
the
tendency
to
accumulate
the
greed
for
an
expansion
of
capital
and
a
production
of
on
an
enlarged
scale
this
is
a
law
of
capitalist
production
imposed
by
incessant
revolutions
in
the
methods
of
production
themselves
the
resulting
depreciation
of
existing
capital
the
general
competitive
struggle
and
the
necessity
of
improving
the
product
and
expanding
the
scale
of
production
for
the
sake
of
and
on
penalty
of
failure
the
market
must
therefore
be
continually
extended
so
that
its
interrelations
and
the
conditions
regulating
them
assume
more
and
more
the
form
of
a
natural
law
independent
of
the
producers
and
become
ever
more
uncontrollable
this
eternal
contradiction
seeks
to
balance
itself
by
an
expansion
of
the
outlying
fields
of
production
but
to
the
extent
that
the
productive
power
develops
it
finds
itself
at
variance
with
the
narrow
basis
on
which
the
conditions
of
consumption
rest
on
this
basis
it
is
no
contradiction
at
all
that
there
should
be
an
excess
of
capital
simultaneously
with
an
excess
of
population
for
while
a
combination
of
these
two
would
indeed
increase
the
mass
of
the
produced
it
would
at
the
same
time
intensify
the
contradiction
between
the
conditions
under
which
this
is
produced
and
those
under
which
it
is
realised
if
we
compare
this
description
with
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
two
are
by
no
means
in
conformity
according
to
the
diagram
there
is
no
inherent
contradiction
between
the
production
of
the
surplus
value
and
its
realisation
rather
the
two
are
identical
the
surplus
value
here
from
the
very
beginning
comes
into
being
in
a
natural
form
exclusively
designed
for
the
requirements
of
accumulation
in
fact
it
leaves
the
place
of
production
in
the
very
form
of
additional
capital
that
is
to
say
it
is
capable
of
realisation
in
the
capitalist
process
of
accumulation
the
capitalists
as
a
class
see
to
it
in
advance
that
the
surplus
value
they
appropriate
is
produced
entirely
in
that
material
form
which
will
permit
and
ensure
its
employment
for
purposes
of
further
accumulation
realisation
and
accumulation
of
the
surplus
value
here
are
both
aspects
of
the
same
process
they
are
logically
identical
therefore
according
to
the
presentation
of
the
reproductive
process
in
the
diagram
society
capacity
to
consume
does
not
put
a
limit
to
production
here
production
automatically
expands
year
by
year
although
the
capacity
of
society
for
consumption
has
not
gone
beyond
its
conditions
of
distribution
this
automatic
continuation
of
expansion
of
accumulation
truly
is
the
of
capitalist
production
on
penalty
of
failure
yet
according
to
the
analysis
in
volume
iii
market
must
therefore
be
continually
extended
market
obviously
transcending
the
consumption
of
capitalists
and
workers
and
if
tugan
baranovski
interprets
the
following
passage
eternal
contradiction
seeks
to
balance
itself
by
an
expansion
of
the
outlying
fields
of
production
as
if
marx
had
meant
production
itself
by
fields
of
production
he
violates
not
only
the
spirit
of
the
language
but
also
marx
clear
train
of
thought
the
fields
of
production
are
clearly
and
unequivocally
not
production
itself
but
consumption
which
be
continually
extended
the
following
passage
in
über
den
amongst
others
sufficiently
shows
that
marx
had
this
in
mind
and
nothing
else
therefore
consistently
denies
the
necessity
for
an
of
the
to
accompany
the
expansion
of
production
and
the
growth
of
capital
the
entire
capital
existing
within
a
country
can
also
be
profitably
used
in
that
country
he
therefore
argues
against
adam
smith
who
had
set
up
his
ricardo
opinion
on
the
one
hand
but
also
contradicted
it
with
his
usual
sure
instinct
in
yet
another
passage
marx
clearly
shows
that
tugan
notion
of
production
for
production
sake
is
wholly
alien
to
him
we
have
seen
in
volume
ii
part
iii
that
a
continuous
circulation
takes
place
between
constant
capital
and
constant
capital
even
without
considering
any
accelerated
accumulation
which
is
in
so
far
independent
of
individual
consumption
as
it
never
enters
into
such
consumption
but
which
is
nevertheless
definitely
limited
by
it
because
the
production
of
constant
capital
never
takes
place
for
its
own
sake
but
solely
because
more
of
this
capital
is
needed
in
those
spheres
of
production
whose
products
pass
into
individual
consumption
admittedly
in
the
diagram
in
volume
ii
tugan
baranovski
sole
support
market
and
production
coincide
they
are
one
and
the
same
expansion
of
the
market
here
means
extended
production
since
production
is
said
to
be
its
own
exclusive
market
the
consumption
of
the
workers
being
an
element
of
production
the
reproduction
of
variable
capital
therefore
the
limit
for
both
the
expansion
of
production
and
the
extension
of
the
market
is
one
and
the
same
it
is
given
by
the
volume
of
the
social
capital
or
the
stage
of
accumulation
already
attained
the
greater
the
quantity
of
surplus
value
that
has
been
extracted
in
the
natural
form
of
capital
the
more
can
be
accumulated
and
the
greater
the
volume
of
accumulation
the
more
surplus
value
can
be
invested
in
its
material
form
of
capital
the
more
can
be
realised
thus
the
diagram
does
not
admit
the
contradiction
outlined
in
the
analysis
of
volume
iii
in
the
process
described
by
the
diagram
there
is
no
need
for
a
continual
extension
of
the
market
beyond
the
consumption
of
capitalists
and
workers
nor
is
the
limited
social
capacity
for
consumption
an
obstacle
to
the
smooth
course
of
production
and
its
unlimited
capacity
for
expansion
the
diagram
does
indeed
permit
of
crises
but
only
because
of
a
lack
of
proportion
within
production
because
of
a
defective
social
control
over
the
productive
process
it
precludes
however
the
deep
and
fundamental
antagonism
between
the
capacity
to
consume
and
the
capacity
to
produce
in
a
capitalist
society
a
conflict
resulting
from
the
very
accumulation
of
capital
which
periodically
bursts
out
in
crises
and
spurs
capital
on
to
a
continual
extension

the

marx
diagram
of

can
not
explain
the
actual
and
historical
process
of
accumulation
and
why
because
of
the
very
premises
of
the
diagram
the
diagram
sets
out
to
describe
the
accumulative
process
on
the
assumption
that
the
capitalists
and
workers
are
the
sole
agents
of
capitalist
consumption
we
have
seen
that
marx
consistently
and
deliberately
assumes
the
universal
and
exclusive
domination
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
as
a
theoretical
premise
of
his
analysis
in
all
three
volumes
of
under
these
conditions
there
can
admittedly
be
no
other
classes
of
society
than
capitalists
and
workers
as
the
diagram
has
it
all
persons
of
capitalist
society
civil
servants
the
liberal
professions
the
clergy
must
as
consumers
be
counted
in
with
these
two
classes
and
preferably
with
the
capitalist
class
this
axiom
however
is
a
theoretical
contrivance
real
life
has
never
known
a
capitalist
society
under
the
exclusive
domination
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
this
theoretical
device
is
perfectly
admissible
so
long
as
it
merely
helps
to
demonstrate
the
problem
in
its
integrity
and
does
not
interfere
with
its
very
conditions
a
case
in
point
is
the
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
of
the
aggregate
social
capital
where
the
problem
itself
rests
upon
a
fiction
in
a
society
producing
by
capitalist
methods
a
society
which
creates
surplus
value
the
whole
of
the
latter
is
taken
to
be
consumed
by
the
capitalists
who
appropriate
it
the
object
is
to
present
the
forms
of
social
production
and
reproduction
under
these
given
conditions
here
the
very
formulation
of
the
problem
implies
that
production
knows
no
other
consumers
than
capitalists
and
workers
and
thus
strictly
conforms
to
marx
premise
universal
and
exclusive
domination
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
the
implications
of
both
fictions
are
the
same
similarly
it
is
quite
legitimate
to
postulate
absolute
dominance
of
capital
in
an
analysis
of
the
accumulation
of
individual
capitals
such
as
is
given
in
volume
i
the
reproduction
of
individual
capitals
is
an
element
in
total
social
reproduction
but
one
which
follows
an
independent
course
contrary
to
the
movements
of
the
other
elements
in
consequence
it
will
not
do
simply
to
take
together
the
individual
movements
of
the
respective
capitals
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
total
movement
of
social
capital
since
the
latter
is
essentially
different
the
natural
conditions
of
reproducing
individual
capitals
therefore
neither
conform
with
one
another
nor
do
they
conform
to
the
relations
of
the
total
capital
under
normal
conditions
of
circulation
every
individual
capital
engages
in
the
process
of
circulation
and
of
accumulation
entirely
on
its
own
account
depending
upon
others
only
in
so
far
of
course
as
it
is
compelled
to
find
a
market
for
its
product
and
must
find
available
the
means
of
production
it
requires
for
its
specific
activities
whether
the
strata
who
afford
this
market
and
provide
the
necessary
means
of
production
are
themselves
capitalist
producers
or
not
is
completely
immaterial
for
the
individual
capital
although
in
theory
the
most
favourable
premise
for
analysing
the
accumulation
of
individual
capital
is
the
assumption
that
capitalist
production
has
attained
universal
and
exclusive
domination
and
is
the
sole
setting
of
this
process
now
however
the
question
arises
whether
the
assumptions
which
were
decisive
in
the
case
of
individual
capital
are
also
legitimate
for
the
consideration
of
aggregate
capital
must
now
put
the
problem
in
this
form
universal
that
is
to
say
provided
that
in
all
branches
of
production
there
is
greater
or
less
accumulation
of
capital
which
in
fact
is
a
condition
of
capitalist
production
and
which
is
just
as
natural
to
the
capitalist
capitalist
as
it
is
natural
to
the
miser
to
amass
money
but
which
is
also
necessary
for
the
perpetuation
of
capitalist
production
what
are
the
of
this
universal
accumulation
to
what
elements
can
it
be
reduced
and
the
answer
conditions
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
are
precisely
those
which
rule
its
original
production
and
reproduction
in
these
conditions
being
that
one
part
of
the
money
buys
labour
and
the
other
commodities
raw
materials
machinery
etc
accumulation
of
new
capital
can
only
proceed
therefore
under
the
same
conditions
under
which
already
existing
capital
is
reproduced
in
real
life
the
actual
conditions
for
the
accumulation
of
the
aggregate
capital
are
quite
different
from
those
prevailing
for
individual
capitals
and
for
simple
reproduction
the
problem
amounts
to
this
if
an
increasing
part
of
the
surplus
value
is
not
consumed
by
the
capitalists
but
employed
in
the
expansion
of
production
what
then
are
the
forms
of
social
reproduction
what
is
left
of
the
social
product
after
deductions
for
the
replacement
of
the
constant
capital
can
not
be
absorbed
by
the
consumption
of
the
workers
and
capitalists
this
being
the
main
aspect
of
the
problem
nor
can
the
workers
and
capitalists
themselves
realise
the
aggregate
product
they
can
always
only
realise
the
variable
capital
that
part
of
the
constant
capital
which
will
be
used
up
and
the
part
of
the
surplus
value
which
will
be
consumed
but
in
this
way
they
merely
ensure
that
production
can
be
renewed
on
its
previous
scale
the
workers
and
capitalists
themselves
can
not
possibly
realise
that
part
of
the
surplus
value
which
is
to
be
capitalised
therefore
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
for
the
purposes
of
accumulation
is
an
impossible
task
for
a
society
which
consists
solely
of
workers
and
capitalists
strangely
enough
all
theorists
who
analysed
the
problem
of
accumulation
from
ricardo
and
sismondi
to
marx
started
with
the
very
assumption
which
makes
their
problem
insoluble
a
sure
instinct
that
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
requires
persons
that
is
to
say
consumers
other
than
the
immediate
agents
of
capitalist
production
workers
and
capitalists
led
to
all
kinds
of
subterfuges
consumption
as
presented
by
malthus
in
the
person
of
the
feudal
landowner
by
vorontsov
in
militarism
by
struve
in
the
professions
and
other
of
the
capitalist
class
or
else
foreign
trade
is
brought
into
play
which
proved
a
useful
safety
valve
to
all
those
who
regarded
accumulation
with
scepticism
from
sismondi
to
nicolayon
because
of
these
insoluble
difficulties
others
like
kirchmann
and
rodbertus
tried
to
do
without
accumulation
altogether
or
like
sismondi
and
his
russian
followers
stressed
the
need
for
at
least
putting
the
dampers
on
accumulation
as
much
as
possible
the
salient
feature
of
the
problem
of
accumulation
and
the
vulnerable
point
of
earlier
attempts
to
solve
it
has
only
been
shown
up
by
more
profound
analysis
his
precise
diagrammatic
demonstration
of
the
total
reproductive
process
and
especially
his
inspired
exposition
of
the
problem
of
simple
reproduction
yet
he
could
not
supply
immediately
a
finished
solution
either
partly
because
he
broke
off
his
analysis
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
begun
it
and
partly
because
he
was
then
preoccupied
as
we
have
shown
with
denouncing
the
analysis
of
adam
smith
and
thus
rather
lost
sight
of
the
main
problem
in
fact
he
made
the
solution
even
more
difficult
by
assuming
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
to
prevail
universally
nevertheless
a
solution
of
the
problem
of
accumulation
in
harmony
both
with
other
parts
of
doctrine
and
with
the
historical
experience
and
daily
practice
of
capitalism
is
implied
in
marx
complete
analysis
of
simple
reproduction
and
his
characterisation
of
the
capitalist
process
as
a
whole
which
shows
up
its
immanent
contradictions
and
their
development
in
vol
iii
in
the
light
of
this
the
deficiencies
of
the
diagram
can
be
corrected
all
the
relations
being
as
it
were
incomplete
a
closer
study
of
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
will
reveal
that
it
points
to
some
sort
of
organisation
more
advanced
than
purely
capitalist
production
and
accumulation
up
to
now
we
have
only
considered
one
aspect
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
problem
of
realising
the
surplus
value
whose
difficulties
hitherto
had
claimed
the
sceptics
whole
attention
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
is
doubtless
a
vital
question
of
capitalist
accumulation
it
requires
as
its
prime
condition
ignoring
for
simplicity
sake
the
capitalists
fund
of
consumption
altogether
that
there
should
be
strata
of
buyers
outside
capitalist
society
buyers
it
should
be
noted
not
consumers
since
the
material
form
of
the
surplus
value
is
quite
irrelevant
to
its
realisation
the
decisive
fact
is
that
the
surplus
value
can
not
be
realised
by
sale
either
to
workers
or
to
capitalists
but
only
if
it
is
sold
to
such
social
organisations
or
strata
whose
own
mode
of
production
is
not
capitalistic
here
we
can
conceive
of
two
different
cases
capitalist
production
supplies
consumer
goods
over
and
above
its
own
requirements
the
demand
of
its
workers
and
capitalists
which
are
bought
by
strata
and
countries
the
english
cotton
industry
for
instance
during
the
first
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
to
some
extent
even
now
has
been
supplying
cotton
textiles
to
the
peasants
and
townspeople
of
the
european
continent
and
to
the
peasants
of
india
america
africa
and
so
on
the
enormous
expansion
of
the
english
cotton
industry
was
thus
founded
on
consumption
by
strata
and
countries
in
england
herself
this
flourishing
cotton
industry
called
forth
development
in
the
production
of
industrial
machinery
bobbins
and
and
further
in
the
metal
and
coal
industries
and
so
on
in
this
instance
department
ii
realised
its
products
to
an
increasing
extent
by
sale
to
social
strata
and
by
its
own
accumulation
it
created
on
its
part
an
increasing
demand
for
the
home
produce
of
department
i
thus
helping
the
latter
to
realise
its
surplus
value
and
to
increase
its
own
accumulation
conversely
capitalist
production
supplies
means
of
production
in
excess
of
its
own
demand
and
finds
buyers
in
countries
english
industry
for
instance
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
supplied
materials
for
the
construction
of
railroads
in
the
american
and
australian
states
the
building
of
railways
can
not
in
itself
be
taken
as
evidence
for
the
domination
of
capitalist
production
in
a
country
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
railways
in
this
case
provided
only
one
of
the
first
conditions
for
the
inauguration
of
capitalist
production
another
example
would
be
the
german
chemical
industry
which
supplies
means
of
production
such
as
dyes
in
great
quantities
to
asiatic
african
and
other
countries
whose
own
production

not
capitalistic
here
department

realises
its
products
in

the
resulting
progressive
expansion
of

gives
rise
to
a
corresponding
expansion
of

in
the
same
capitalistically
producing

in
order
to

the
means
of
subsistence
for
the
growing
army
of

in

i
each
of
these
cases
differs
from
marx
diagram
in
one
case
the
product
of
department
ii
exceeds
the
needs
of
both
departments
measured
by
the
variable
capital
and
the
consumed
part
of
the
surplus
value
in
the
second
case
the
product
of
department
i
exceeds
the
volume
of
constant
capital
in
both
departments
enlarged
though
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
production
in
both
cases
the
surplus
value
does
not
come
into
being
in
that
natural
form
which
would
make
its
capitalisation
in
either
department
possible
and
necessary
these
two
prototypes
continually
overlap
in
real
life
supplement
each
other
and
merge
in
this
contest
one
point
seems
still
obscure
the
surplus
of
consumer
goods
say
cotton
fabrics
which
is
sold
to
countries
does
not
exclusively
represent
surplus
value
but
as
a
capitalist
commodity
it
embodies
also
constant
and
variable
capital
it
seems
quite
arbitrary
to
assume
that
just
those
commodities
which
are
sold
outside
the
capitalist
strata
of
society
should
represent
nothing
but
surplus
value
on
the
other
hand
department
i
clearly
can
in
this
case
not
only
realise
its
surplus
value
but
also
accumulate
and
that
without
requiring
another
market
for
its
product
than
the
two
departments
of
capitalist
production
yet
both
these
objections
are
only
apparent
all
we
need
remember
is
that
each
component
of
the
aggregate
product
represents
a
proportion
of
the
total
value
that
under
conditions
of
capitalist
production
not
only
the
aggregate
product
but
every
single
commodity
contains
surplus
value
which
consideration
does
not
prevent
the
individual
capitalist
however
from
computing
that
the
sale
of
his
specific
commodities
must
first
reimburse
him
for
his
outlay
on
constant
capital
and
secondly
replace
his
variable
capital
or
rather
loosely
but
in
accordance
with
actual
practice
it
must
first
replace
his
fixed
and
then
his
circulating
capital
what
then
remains
will
go
down
as
profit
similarly
we
can
divide
the
aggregate
social
product
into
three
proportionate
parts
which
in
terms
of
value
correspond
to
the
constant
capital
that
has
been
used
up
in
society
the
variable
capital
and
the
extracted
surplus
value
in
the
case
of
simple
reproduction
these
proportions
are
also
reflected
in
the
material
shape
of
the
aggregate
product
the
constant
capital
materialises
as
means
of
production
the
variable
capital
as
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
and
the
surplus
value
as
means
of
subsistence
for
the
capitalist
yet
as
we
know
the
concept
of
simple
reproduction
with
consumption
of
the
entire
surplus
value
by
the
capitalists
is
a
mere
fiction
as
for
enlarged
reproduction
or
accumulation
in
marx
diagram
the
composition
of
the
social
product
in
terms
of
value
is
also
strictly
in
proportion
to
its
material
form
the
surplus
value
or
rather
that
part
of
it
which
is
earmarked
for
capitalisation
has
from
the
very
beginning
the
form
of
material
means
of
production
and
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
in
a
ratio
appropriate
to
the
expansion
of
production
on
a
given
technical
basis
as
we
have
seen
this
conception
which
is
based
upon
the
and
isolation
of
capitalist
production
falls
down
as
soon
as
we
consider
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
if
we
assume
however
that
the
surplus
value
is
realised
outside
the
sphere
of
capitalist
production
then
its
material
form
is
independent
of
the
requirements
of
capitalist
production
itself
its
material
form
conforms
to
the
requirements
of
those
circles
who
help
to
realise
it
that
is
to
say
capitalist
surplus
value
can
take
the
form
of
consumer
goods
cotton
fabrics
or
of
means
of
production
materials
for
railway
construction
as
the
case
may
be
if
one
department
realises
its
surplus
value
by
exporting
its
products
and
with
the
ensuing
expansion
of
production
helps
the
other
department
to
realise
its
surplus
value
on
the
home
market
then
the
fact
still
remains
that
the
surplus
value
must
yet
be
taken
as
realised
outside
the
two
departments
either
mediately
or
immediately
similar
considerations
enable
the
individual
capitalist
to
realise
his
surplus
value
even
if
the
whole
of
his
commodities
can
only
replace
either
the
variable
or
the
constant
capital
of
another
capitalist
nor
is
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
the
only
vital
aspect
of
reproduction
given
that
department
i
has
disposed
of
its
surplus
value
outside
thereby
starting
the
process
of
accumulation
and
further
that
it
can
expect
a
new
increase
in
the
demand
in
circles
these
two
conditions
add
up
to
only
half
of
what
is
required
for
accumulation
there
is
many
a
slip
the
cup
and
the
lip
the
second
requirement
of
accumulation
is
access
to
material
elements
necessary
for
expanding
reproduction
seeing
that
we
have
just
turned
the
surplus
product
of
department
i
into
money
by
getting
rid
of
the
surplus
means
of
production
to
circles
from
where
are
these
material
elements
then
to
come
the
transaction
which
is
the
portal
for
realising
the
surplus
value
is
also
as
it
were
a
backdoor
out
of
which
flies
all
possibility
of
converting
this
realised
surplus
value
into
productive
capital
one
leads
to
the
nether
regions
and
the
other
to
the
deep
sea
let
us
take
a
closer
look
here
we
use
in
both
departments
i
and
ii
as
if
it
were
the
entire
constant
capital
in
production
yet
this
we
know
is
wrong
only
for
the
sake
of
simplifying
the
diagram
have
we
disregarded
that
the
which
figures
in
departments
i
and
ii
of
the
diagram
is
only
part
of
the
aggregate
constant
capital
of
society
that
is
to
say
that
part
which
circulating
during
one
year
is
used
up
and
embodied
in
the
products
of
one
period
of
production
yet
it
would
be
perfectly
absurd
if
capitalist
production
or
any
other
would
use
up
its
entire
constant
capital
and
create
it
anew
in
every
period
of
production
on
the
contrary
we
assume
that
the
whole
mass
of
means
of
production
for
the
periodical
total
renewal
of
which
the
diagram
provides
in
annual
instalments
renewal
of
the
part
lies
at
the
back
of
production
as
presented
in
the
diagram
with
progressing
labour
productivity
and
an
expanding
volume
of
production
this
mass
increases
not
only
absolutely
but
also
relatively
to
the
part
which
is
consumed
in
production
in
every
case
together
with
a
corresponding
increase
in
the
efficiency
of
the
constant
capital
it
is
the
more
intensive
exploitation
of
this
part
of
the
constant
capital
irrespective
of
its
increase
in
value
which
is
of
paramount
importance
for
the
expansion
of
production
the
extractive
industries
mines
the
raw
materials
form
no
part
of
the
capital
advanced
the
subject
of
labour
is
in
this
case
not
a
product
of
previous
labour
but
is
furnished
by
nature
gratis
as
in
the
case
of
metals
minerals
coal
stone
etc
in
these
cases
the
constant
capital
consists
almost
exclusively
of
instruments
of
labour
which
can
very
well
absorb
an
increased
quantity
of
labour
day
and
night
shifts
of
labourers
all
other
things
being
equal
the
mass
and
value
of
the
product
will
rise
in
direct
proportion
to
the
labour
expended
as
on
the
first
day
of
production
the
original
now
turned
into
the
creators
of
the
material
elements
of
capital
man
and
nature
still
work
together
thanks
to
the
elasticity
of
the
domain
of
accumulation
has
extended
without
any
previous
enlargement
of
constant
in
agriculture
the
land
under
cultivation
can
not
be
increased
without
the
advance
of
more
seed
and
manure
but
this
advance
once
made
the
purely
mechanical
working
of
the
soil
itself
produces
a
marvellous
effect
on
the
amount
of
the
product
a
greater
quantity
of
labour
done
by
the
same
number
of
labourers
as
before
thus
increases
the
fertility
without
requiring
any
new
advance
in
the
instruments
of
labour
it
is
once
again
the
direct
action
of
man
on
nature
which
becomes
an
immediate
source
of
greater
accumulation
without
the
intervention
of
any
new
capital
finally
in
what
is
called
manufacturing
industry
every
additional
expenditure
of
labour
presupposes
a
corresponding
additional
expenditure
of
raw
materials
but
not
necessarily
of
instruments
of
labour
and
as
extractive
industry
and
agriculture
supply
manufacturing
industry
with
its
raw
materials
and
those
of
its
instruments
of
labour
the
additional
product
the
former
have
created
without
additional
advance
of
capital
tells
also
in
favour
of
the
general
result
by
incorporating
with
itself
the
two
primary
creators
of
wealth
and
the
land
capital
acquires
a
power
of
expansion
that
permits
it
to
augment
the
elements
of
its
accumulation
beyond
the
limits
apparently
fixed
by
its
own
magnitude
or
by
the
value
and
the
mass
of
the
means
of
production
already
produced
in
which
it
has
its
being
in
addition
there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
means
of
production
and
consumer
goods
should
be
produced
by
capitalist
methods
alone
this
assumption
for
all
marx
used
it
as
the
of
his
thesis
is
in
conformity
neither
with
the
daily
practice
and
the
history
of
capital
nor
with
the
specific
character
of
this
mode
of
production
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
great
part
of
the
surplus
value
in
england
was
produced
in
form
of
cotton
fabrics
yet
the
material
elements
for
the
capitalisation
of
this
surplus
value
although
they
certainly
represented
a
surplus
product
still
were
by
no
means
all
capitalist
surplus
value
to
mention
only
raw
cotton
from
the
slave
states
of
the
american
union
or
grain
a
means
of
subsistence
for
the
english
workers
from
the
fields
of
russia
how
much
capitalist
accumulation
depends
upon
means
of
production
which
are
not
produced
by
capitalist
methods
is
shown
for
example
by
the
cotton
crisis
in
england
during
the
american
war
of
secession
when
the
cultivation
of
the
plantations
came
to
a
standstill
or
by
the
crisis
of
european
during
the
war
in
the
east
when
flax
could
not
be
imported
from
russia
we
need
only
recall
that
imports
of
corn
raised
by
peasants
not
produced
by
capitalist
methods
played
a
vital
part
in
the
feeding
of
industrial
labour
as
an
element
that
is
to
say
of
variable
capital
for
a
further
illustration
of
the
close
ties
between
strata
and
the
material
elements
necessary
to
the
accumulation
of
capital
moreover
capitalist
production
by
its
very
nature
can
not
be
restricted
to
such
means
of
production
as
are
produced
by
capitalist
methods
cheap
elements
of
constant
capital
are
essential
to
the
individual
capitalist
who
strives
to
increase
his
rate
of
profit
in
addition
the
very
condition
of
continuous
improvements
in
labour
productivity
as
the
most
important
method
of
increasing
the
rate
of
surplus
value
is
unrestricted
utilisation
of
all
substances
and
facilities
afforded
by
nature
and
soil
to
tolerate
any
restriction
in
this
respect
would
be
contrary
to
the
very
essence
of
capital
its
whole
mode
of
existence
after
many
centuries
of
development
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
still
constitutes
only
a
fragment
of
total
world
production
even
in
the
small
continent
of
europe
where
it
now
chiefly
prevails
it
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
dominating
entire
branches
of
production
such
as
peasant
agriculture
and
the
independent
handicrafts
the
same
holds
true
further
for
large
parts
of
north
america
and
for
a
number
of
regions
in
the
other
continents
in
general
capitalist
production
has
hitherto
been
confined
mainly
to
the
countries
in
the
temperate
zone
whilst
it
made
comparatively
little
progress
in
the
east
for
instance
and
the
south
thus
if
it
were
dependent
exclusively
on
elements
of
production
obtainable
within
such
narrow
limits
its
present
level
and
indeed
its
development
in
general
would
have
been
impossible
from
the
very
beginning
the
forms
and
laws
of
capitalist
production
aim
to
comprise
the
entire
globe
as
a
store
of
productive
forces
capital
impelled
to
appropriate
productive
forces
for
purposes
of
exploitation
ransacks
the
whole
world
it
procures
its
means
of
production
from
all
corners
of
the
earth
seizing
them
if
necessary
by
force
from
all
levels
of
civilisation
and
from
all
forms
of
society
the
problem
of
the
material
elements
of
capitalist
accumulation
far
from
being
solved
by
the
material
form
of
the
surplus
value
that
has
been
produced
takes
on
quite
a
different
aspect
it
becomes
necessary
for
capital
progressively
to
dispose
ever
more
fully
of
the
whole
globe
to
acquire
an
unlimited
choice
of
means
of
production
with
regard
to
both
quality
and
quantity
so
as
to
find
productive
employment
for
the
surplus
value
it
has
realised
the
process
of
accumulation
elastic
and
spasmodic
as
it
is
requires
inevitably
free
access
to
ever
new
areas
of
raw
materials
in
case
of
need
both
when
imports
from
old
sources
fail
or
when
social
demand
suddenly
increases
when
the
war
of
secession
interfered
with
the
import
of
american
cotton
causing
the
notorious
famine
in
the
lancashire
district
new
and
immense
cotton
plantations
sprang
up
in
egypt
almost
at
once
as
if
by
magic
here
it
was
oriental
despotism
combined
with
an
ancient
system
of
bondage
which
had
created
a
sphere
of
activity
for
european
capital
only
capital
with
its
technical
resources
can
effect
such
a
miraculous
change
in
so
short
a
time
but
only
on
the
soil
of
more
primitive
social
conditions
can
it
develop
the
ascendancy
necessary
to
achieve
such
miracles
another
example
of
the
same
kind
is
the
enormous
increase
in
the
world
consumption
of
rubber
which
at
present
necessitates
a
supply
of
latex
to
the
value
of
the
economic
basis
for
the
production
of
raw
materials
is
a
primitive
system
of
exploitation
practised
by
european
capital
in
the
african
colonies
and
in
america
where
the
institutions
of
slavery
and
bondage
are
combined
in
various
forms
between
the
production
of
surplus
value
then
and
the
subsequent
period
of
accumulation
two
separate
transactions
take
place
that
of
realising
the
surplus
value
of
converting
it
into
pure
value
and
that
of
transforming
this
pure
value
into
productive
capital
they
are
both
dealings
between
capitalist
production
and
the
surrounding
world
from
the
aspect
both
of
realising
the
surplus
value
and
of
procuring
the
material
elements
of
constant
capital
international
trade
is
a
prime
necessity
for
the
historical
existence
of
capitalism
an
international
trade
which
under
actual
conditions
is
essentially
an
exchange
between
capitalistic
and
modes
of
production
hitherto
we
have
considered
accumulation
solely
with
regard
to
surplus
value
and
constant
capital
the
third
element
of
accumulation
is
variable
capital
which
increases
with
progressive
accumulation
in
marx
diagram
the
social
product
contains
ever
more
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
as
the
material
form
proper
to
this
variable
capital
the
variable
capital
however
is
not
really
the
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
but
is
in
fact
living
labour
for
whose
reproduction
these
means
of
subsistence
are
necessary
one
of
the
fundamental
conditions
of
accumulation
is
therefore
a
supply
of
living
labour
which
can
be
mobilised
by
capital
to
meet
its
demands
this
supply
can
be
increased
under
favourable
conditions
but
only
up
to
a
certain
point
by
longer
hours
and
more
intensive
work
both
these
methods
of
increasing
the
supply
however
do
not
enlarge
the
variable
capital
or
do
so
only
to
a
small
extent
payment
for
overtime
moreover
they
are
confined
to
definite
and
rather
narrow
limits
which
they
can
not
exceed
owing
to
both
natural
and
social
causes
the
increasing
growth
of
variable
capital
which
accompanies
accumulation
must
therefore
become
manifest
in
ever
greater
numbers
of
employed
labour
where
can
this
additional
labour
be
found
in
his
analysis
of
the
accumulation
of
individual
capital
marx
gives
the
following
answer
in
order
to
allow
of
these
elements
actually
functioning
as
capital
the
capitalist
class
requires
additional
labour
if
the
exploitation
of
the
labourers
already
employed
does
not
increase
either
extensively
or
intensively
then
additional
must
be
found
for
this
the
mechanism
of
capitalist
production
provides
beforehand
by
converting
the
working
class
into
a
class
dependent
on
wages
a
class
whose
ordinary
wages
suffice
not
only
for
its
maintenance
but
for
its
increase
it
is
only
necessary
for
capital
to
incorporate
this
additional
annually
supplied
by
the
working
class
in
the
shape
of
labourers
of
all
ages
with
the
surplus
means
of
production
comprised
in
the
annual
produce
and
the
conversion
of
into
capital
is
complete
thus
the
increase
in
the
variable
capital
is
directly
and
exclusively
attributed
to
the
natural
physical
increase
of
a
working
class
already
dominated
by
capital
this
is
in
strict
conformity
with
the
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
which
recognises
only
the
social
classes
of
capitalists
and
workers
and
regards
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
as
exclusive
and
absolute
on
these
assumptions
the
natural
increase
of
the
working
class
is
the
only
source
of
extending
the
labour
supply
commanded
by
capital
this
view
however
is
contrary
to
the
laws
governing
the
process
of
accumulation
the
natural
propagation
of
the
workers
and
the
requirements
of
accumulating
capital
are
not
correlative
in
respect
of
time
or
quantity
marx
himself
has
most
brilliantly
shown
that
natural
propagation
can
not
keep
up
with
the
sudden
expansive
needs
of
capital
if
natural
propagation
were
the
only
foundation
for
the
development
of
capital
accumulation
in
its
periodical
swings
from
overstrain
to
exhaustion
could
not
continue
nor
could
the
productive
sphere
expand
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
accumulation
itself
would
become
impossible
the
latter
requires
an
unlimited
freedom
of
movement
in
respect
of
the
growth
of
variable
capital
equal
to
that
which
it
enjoys
with
regard
to
the
elements
of
constant
capital
that
is
to
say
it
must
needs
dispose
over
the
supply
of
labour
power
without
restriction
marx
considers
that
this
can
be
achieved
by
an
reserve
army
of
workers
his
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
admittedly
does
not
recognise
such
an
army
nor
could
it
have
room
for
it
since
the
natural
propagation
of
the
capitalist
wage
proletariat
can
not
provide
an
industrial
reserve
army
labour
for
this
army
is
recruited
from
social
reservoirs
outside
the
dominion
of
capital
it
is
drawn
into
the
wage
proletariat
only
if
need
arises
only
the
existence
of
groups
and
countries
can
guarantee
such
a
supply
of
additional
labour
power
for
capitalist
production
yet
in
his
analysis
of
the
industrial
reserve
army
marx
only
allows
for
the
displacement
of
older
workers
by
machinery
an
influx
of
rural
workers
into
the
towns
in
consequence
of
the
ascendancy
of
capitalist
production
in
agriculture
occasional
labour
that
has
dropped
out
of
industry
and
finally
the
lowest
residue
of
relative
the
paupers
all
these
categories
are
cast
off
by
the
capitalist
system
of
production
in
some
form
or
other
they
constitute
a
wage
proletariat
that
is
worn
out
and
made
redundant
one
way
or
another
marx
obviously
influenced
by
english
conditions
involving
a
high
level
of
capitalist
development
held
that
the
rural
workers
who
continually
migrate
to
the
towns
belong
to
the
wage
proletariat
since
they
were
formerly
dominated
by
agricultural
capital
and
now
become
subject
to
industrial
capital
he
ignores
however
the
problem
which
is
of
paramount
importance
for
conditions
on
the
continent
of
europe
namely
the
sources
from
which
this
urban
and
rural
proletariat
is
recruited
the
continual
process
by
which
the
rural
and
urban
middle
strata
become
proletarian
with
the
decay
of
peasant
economy
and
of
small
artisan
enterprises
the
very
process
that
is
to
say
of
incessant
transition
from
to
capitalist
conditions
of
a
labour
power
that
is
cast
off
by
not
capitalist
modes
of
production
in
their
progressive
breakdown
and
disintegration
besides
the
decay
of
european
peasants
and
artisans
we
must
here
also
mention
the
disintegration
of
the
most
varied
primitive
forms
of
production
and
of
social
organisation
in
countries
since
capitalist
production
can
develop
fully
only
with
complete
access
to
all
territories
and
climes
it
can
no
more
confine
itself
to
the
natural
resources
and
productive
forces
of
the
temperate
zone
than
it
can
manage
with
white
labour
alone
capital
needs
other
races
to
exploit
territories
where
the
white
man
can
not
work
it
must
be
able
to
mobilise
world
labour
power
without
restriction
in
order
to
utilise
all
productive
forces
of
the
globe
up
to
the
limits
imposed
by
a
system
of
producing
surplus
value
this
labour
power
however
is
in
most
cases
rigidly
bound
by
the
traditional
organisation
of
production
it
must
first
be
free
in
order
to
be
enrolled
in
the
active
army
of
capital
the
emancipation
of
labour
power
from
primitive
social
conditions
and
its
absorption
by
the
capitalist
wage
system
is
one
of
the
indispensable
historical
bases
of
capitalism
for
the
first
genuinely
capitalist
branch
of
production
the
english
cotton
industry
not
only
the
cotton
of
the
southern
states
of
the
american
union
was
essential
but
also
the
millions
of
african
negroes
who
were
shipped
to
america
to
provide
the
labour
power
for
the
plantations
and
who
later
as
a
free
proletariat
were
incorporated
in
the
class
of
wage
labourers
in
a
capitalist
system
obtaining
the
necessary
labour
power
from
societies
the
is
ever
more
important
for
capital
in
the
colonies
all
possible
methods
of
compulsion
are
applied
to
solving
this
problem
to
transfer
labour
from
former
social
systems
to
the
command
of
capital
this
endeavour
leads
to
the
most
peculiar
combinations
between
the
modern
wage
system
and
primitive
authority
in
the
colonial
countries
this
is
a
concrete
example
of
the
fact
that
capitalist
production
can
not
manage
without
labour
power
from
other
social
organisations
admittedly
marx
dealt
in
detail
with
the
process
of
appropriating
means
of
production
as
well
as
with
the
transformation
of
the
peasants
into
a
capitalist
proletariat
chapter
xxiv
of
vol
i
is
devoted
to
describing
the
origin
of
the
english
proletariat
of
the
capitalistic
agricultural
tenant
class
and
of
industrial
capital
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
looting
of
colonial
countries
by
european
capital
yet
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
all
this
is
treated
solely
with
a
view
to
primitive
accumulation
for
marx
these
processes
are
incidental
illustrating
merely
the
genesis
of
capital
its
first
appearance
in
the
world
they
are
as
it
were
travails
by
which
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
emerges
from
a
feudal
society
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
analyse
the
capitalist
process
of
production
and
circulation
he
reaffirms
the
universal
and
exclusive
domination
of
capitalist
production
yet
as
we
have
seen
capitalism
in
its
full
maturity
also
depends
in
all
respects
on
strata
and
social
organisations
existing
side
by
side
with
it
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
a
market
for
the
additional
product
as
sismondi
and
the
later
critics
and
doubters
of
capitalist
accumulation
would
have
it
the
interrelations
of
accumulating
capital
and
forms
of
production
extend
over
values
as
well
as
over
material
conditions
for
constant
capital
variable
capital
and
surplus
value
alike
the
mode
of
production
is
the
given
historical
setting
for
this
process
since
the
accumulation
of
capital
becomes
impossible
in
all
points
without
surroundings
we
can
not
gain
a
true
picture
of
it
by
assuming
the
exclusive
and
absolute
domination
of
the
capitalist
mode
of
production
sismondi
and
his
school
when
they
attributed
their
difficulties
entirely
to
the
problem
of
realising
the
surplus
value
indeed
revealed
a
proper
sense
for
the
conditions
vital
to
accumulation
yet
the
conditions
for
augmenting
the
material
elements
of
constant
and
variable
capital
are
quite
a
different
matter
from
those
which
govern
the
realisation
of
surplus
value
capital
needs
the
means
of
production
and
the
labour
power
of
the
whole
globe
for
untrammelled
accumulation
it
can
not
manage
without
the
natural
resources
and
the
labour
power
of
all
territories
seeing
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
resources
and
labour
power
is
in
fact
still
in
the
orbit
of
production
this
being
the
historical
of
accumulation
capital
must
go
all
out
to
obtain
ascendancy
over
these
territories
and
social
organisations
there
is
no
reason
why
rubber
plantations
say
run
on
capitalist
lines
such
as
have
been
laid
out
in
india
might
not
serve
the
ends
of
capitalist
production
just
as
well
yet
if
the
countries
of
those
branches
of
production
are
predominantly
capital
will
endeavour
to
establish
domination
over
these
countries
and
societies
and
in
fact
primitive
conditions
allow
of
a
greater
drive
and
of
far
more
ruthless
measures
than
could
be
tolerated
under
purely
capitalist
social
conditions
it
is
quite
different
with
the
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
here
outside
consumers
are
really
essential
thus
the
immediate
and
vital
conditions
for
capital
and
its
accumulation
is
the
existence
of
buyers
of
the
surplus
value
which
is
decisive
to
this
extent
for
the
problem
of
capitalist
accumulation
whatever
the
theoretical
aspects
the
accumulation
of
capital
as
an
historical
process
depends
in
every
respect
upon
social
strata
and
forms
of
social
organisation
the
solution
to
this
problem
which
for
almost
a
century
has
been
the
bone
of
contention
in
economic
theory
thus
lies
between
the
two
extremes
of
the
scepticism
preached
by
sismondi
kirchmann
vorontsov
and
nicolayon
who
flatly
denied
accumulation
and
the
crude
optimism
advocated
by
ricardo
say
and
tugan
baranovski
who
believed
in
capital
unlimited
capacity
for
parthenogenesis
with
the
logical
corollary
of
the
solution
envisaged
by
marx
lies
in
the
dialectical
conflict
that
capitalism
needs
social
organisations
as
the
setting
for
its
development
that
it
proceeds
by
assimilating
the
very
conditions
which
alone
can
ensure
its
own
existence
at
this
point
we
should
revise
the
conceptions
of
internal
and
external
markets
which
were
so
important
in
the
controversy
about
accumulation
they
are
both
vital
to
capitalist
development
and
yet
fundamentally
different
though
they
must
be
conceived
in
terms
of
social
economy
rather
than
of
political
geography
in
this
light
the
internal
market
is
the
capitalist
market
production
itself
buying
its
own
products
and
supplying
its
own
elements
of
production
the
external
market
is
the
social
environment
which
absorbs
the
products
of
capitalism
and
supplies
producer
goods
and
labour
power
for
capitalist
production
thus
from
the
point
of
view
of
economics
germany
and
england
traffic
in
commodities
chiefly
on
an
internal
capitalist
market
whilst
the
give
and
take
between
german
industry
and
german
peasants
is
transacted
on
an
external
market
as
far
as
german
capital
is
concerned
these
concepts
are
strict
and
precise
as
can
be
seen
from
the
diagram
of
reproduction
internal
capitalist
trade
can
at
best
realise
only
certain
quantities
of
value
contained
in
the
social
product
the
constant
capital
that
has
been
used
up
the
variable
capital
and
the
consumed
part
of
the
surplus
value
that
part
of
the
surplus
value
however
which
is
earmarked
for
capitalisation
must
be
realised
elsewhere
if
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
is
the
real
motive
force
and
aim
of
production
it
must
yet
proceed
within
the
limits
given
by
the
renewal
of
constant
and
variable
capital
and
also
of
the
consumed
part
of
the
surplus
value
further
with
the
international
development
of
capitalism
the
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
becomes
ever
more
urgent
and
precarious
and
the
substratum
of
constant
and
variable
capital
becomes
an
mass
both
absolutely
and
in
relation
to
the
surplus
value
hence
the
contradictory
phenomena
that
the
old
capitalist
countries
provide
ever
larger
markets
for
and
become
increasingly
dependent
upon
one
another
yet
on
the
other
hand
compete
ever
more
ruthlessly
for
trade
relations
with
countries
the
conditions
for
the
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
clash
increasingly
with
the
conditions
for
the
renewal
of
the
aggregate
capital
a
conflict
which
incidentally
is
merely
a
counterpart
of
the
contradictions
implied
in
the
law
of
a
declining
profit
rate
footnotes
capital
and
the
productivity
of
labour
advance
and
the
standard
of
capitalist
production
in
general
is
on
a
higher
level
of
development
then
there
is
a
correspondingly
greater
mass
of
commodities
passing
through
the
market
from
production
to
individual
and
industrial
consumption
greater
certainty
that
each
particular
capital
will
find
the
conditions
for
its
reproduction

done
if
the

of

grows
or
if
their

time
is

this
however
can
not
be
considered
a
ready
measure
for
accumulation
the
working
population
can
increase
if
formerly
unproductive

ones
or
if

however

lastly
the

increase
through

if

used

are

natal
matabeleland
by
stripping
them
of
all

and

depriving
them
of
their

of

by
making
them
into
proletarians
and
also
demoralising
them
with
alcohol
later
when
they
are
already
within
the
of
capital
spirits
to
which
they
have
just
been
accustomed
are
strictly
prohibited
the
object
of
exploitation
must
be
kept
fit
for
use
finally
they
are
simply
pressed
into
the
wage
system
of
capital
by
force
by
imprisonment
and
flogging
the
relations
between
germany
and
england
provide
a
typical
example
the
struggle
against
natural
economy
capitalism
arises
and
develops
historically
amidst
a
society
in
western
europe
it
is
found
at
first
in
a
feudal
environment
from
which
it
in
fact
sprang
the
system
of
bondage
in
rural
areas
and
the
guild
system
in
the
towns
and
later
after
having
swallowed
up
the
feudal
system
it
exists
mainly
in
an
environment
of
peasants
and
artisans
that
is
to
say
in
a
system
of
simple
commodity
production
both
in
agriculture
and
trade
european
capitalism
is
further
surrounded
by
vast
territories
of
civilisation
ranging
over
all
levels
of
development
from
the
primitive
communist
hordes
of
nomad
herdsmen
hunters
and
gatherers
to
commodity
production
by
peasants
and
artisans
this
is
the
setting
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
we
must
distinguish
three
phases
the
struggle
of
capital
against
natural
economy
the
struggle
against
commodity
economy
and
the
competitive
struggle
of
capital
on
the
international
stage
for
the
remaining
conditions
of
accumulation
the
existence
and
development
of
capitalism
requires
an
environment
of
forms
of
production
but
not
every
one
of
these
forms
will
serve
its
ends
capitalism
needs
social
strata
as
a
market
for
its
surplus
value
as
a
source
of
supply
for
its
means
of
production
and
as
a
reservoir
of
labour
power
for
its
wage
system
for
all
these
purposes
forms
of
production
based
upon
a
natural
economy
are
of
no
use
to
capital
in
all
social
organisations
where
natural
economy
prevails
where
there
are
primitive
peasant
communities
with
common
ownership
of
the
land
a
feudal
system
of
bondage
or
anything
of
this
nature
economic
organisation
is
essentially
in
response
to
the
internal
demand
and
therefore
there
is
no
demand
or
very
little
for
foreign
goods
and
also
as
a
rule
no
surplus
production
or
at
least
no
urgent
need
to
dispose
of
surplus
products
what
is
most
important
however
is
that
in
any
natural
economy
production
only
goes
on
because
both
means
of
production
and
labour
power
are
bound
in
one
form
or
another
the
communist
peasant
community
no
less
than
the
feudal
farm
and
similar
institutions
maintain
their
economic
organisation
by
subjecting
the
labour
power
and
the
most
important
means
of
production
the
land
to
the
rule
of
law
and
custom
a
natural
economy
thus
confronts
the
requirements
of
capitalism
at
every
turn
with
rigid
barriers
capitalism
must
therefore
always
and
everywhere
fight
a
battle
of
annihilation
against
every
historical
form
of
natural
economy
that
it
encounters
whether
this
is
slave
economy
feudalism
primitive
communism
or
patriarchal
peasant
economy
the
principal
methods
in
this
struggle
are
political
force
revolution
war
oppressive
taxation
by
the
state
and
cheap
goods
they
are
partly
applied
simultaneously
and
partly
they
succeed
and
complement
one
another
in
europe
force
assumed
revolutionary
forms
in
the
fight
against
feudalism
this
is
the
ultimate
explanation
of
the
bourgeois
revolutions
in
the
seventeenth
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
in
the
countries
where
it
fights
more
primitive
social
organisations
it
assumes
the
forms
of
colonial
policy
these
methods
together
with
the
systems
of
taxation
applied
in
such
cases
and
commercial
relations
also
particularly
with
primitive
communities
form
an
alliance
in
which
political
power
and
economic
factors
go
hand
in
hand
in
detail
capital
in
its
struggle
against
societies
with
a
natural
economy
pursues
the
following
ends
to
gain
immediate
possession
of
important
sources
of
productive
forces
such
as
land
game
in
primeval
forests
minerals
precious
stones
and
ores
products
of
exotic
flora
such
as
rubber
etc
to
labour
power
and
to
coerce
it
into
service
to
introduce
a
commodity
economy
to
separate
trade
and
agriculture
at
the
time
of
primitive
accumulation
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
when
the
history
of
capitalism
in
europe
began
and
right
into
the
nineteenth
century
dispossessing
the
peasants
in
england
and
on
the
continent
was
the
most
striking
weapon
in
the
transformation
of
means
of
production
and
labour
power
into
capital
yet
capital
in
power
performs
the
same
task
even
and
on
an
even
more
important
scale
by
modern
colonial
policy
it
is
an
illusion
to
hope
that
capitalism
will
ever
be
content
with
the
means
of
production
which
it
can
acquire
by
way
of
commodity
exchange
in
this
respect
already
capital
is
faced
with
difficulties
because
vast
tracts
of
the
surface
are
in
the
possession
of
social
organisations
that
have
no
desire
for
commodity
exchange
or
can
not
because
of
the
entire
social
structure
and
the
forms
of
ownership
offer
for
sale
the
productive
forces
in
which
capital
is
primarily
interested
the
most
important
of
these
productive
forces
is
of
course
the
land
its
hidden
mineral
treasure
and
its
meadows
woods
and
water
and
further
the
flocks
of
the
primitive
shepherd
tribes
if
capital
were
here
to
rely
on
the
process
of
slow
internal
disintegration
it
might
take
centuries
to
wait
patiently
until
the
most
important
means
of
production
could
be
alienated
by
trading
in
consequence
of
this
process
were
tantamount
to
renouncing
the
productive
forces
of
those
territories
altogether
hence
derives
the
vital
necessity
for
capitalism
in
its
relations
with
colonial
countries
to
appropriate
the
most
important
means
of
production
since
the
primitive
associations
of
the
natives
are
the
strongest
protection
for
their
social
organisations
and
for
their
material
bases
of
existence
capital
must
begin
by
planning
for
the
systematic
destruction
and
annihilation
of
all
the
social
units
which
obstruct
its
development
with
that
we
have
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
primitive
accumulation
this
process
is
still
going
on
each
new
colonial
expansion
is
accompanied
as
a
matter
of
course
by
a
relentless
battle
of
capital
against
the
social
and
economic
ties
of
the
natives
who
are
also
forcibly
robbed
of
their
means
of
production
and
labour
power
any
hope
to
restrict
the
accumulation
of
capital
exclusively
to
competition
to
regular
commodity
exchange
such
as
takes
place
between
capitalist
rests
on
the
pious
belief
that
capital
can
accumulate
without
mediation
of
the
productive
forces
and
without
the
demand
of
more
primitive
organisations
and
that
it
can
rely
upon
the
slow
internal
process
of
a
disintegrating
natural
economy
accumulation
with
its
spasmodic
expansion
can
no
more
wait
for
and
be
content
with
a
natural
internal
disintegration
of
formations
and
their
transition
to
commodity
economy
than
it
can
wait
for
and
be
content
with
the
natural
increase
of
the
working
population
force
is
the
only
solution
open
to
capital
the
accumulation
of
capital
seen
as
an
historical
process
employs
force
as
a
permanent
weapon
not
only
at
its
genesis
but
further
on
down
to
the
present
day
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
primitive
societies
involved
it
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
for
them
there
can
be
no
other
attitude
than
opposition
and
fight
to
the
finish
complete
exhaustion
and
extinction
hence
permanent
occupation
of
the
colonies
by
the
military
native
risings
and
punitive
expeditions
are
the
order
of
the
day
for
any
colonial
regime
the
method
of
violence
then
is
the
immediate
consequence
of
the
clash
between
capitalism
and
the
organisations
of
a
natural
economy
which
would
restrict
accumulation
their
means
of
production
and
their
labour
power
no
less
than
their
demand
for
surplus
products
is
necessary
to
capitalism
yet
the
latter
is
fully
determined
to
undermine
their
independence
as
social
units
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
their
means
of
production
and
labour
power
and
to
convert
them
into
commodity
buyers
this
method
is
the
most
profitable
and
gets
the
quickest
results
and
so
it
is
also
the
most
expedient
for
capital
in
fact
it
is
invariably
accompanied
by
a
growing
militarism
whose
importance
for
accumulation
will
be
demonstrated
below
in
another
connection
british
policy
in
india
and
french
policy
in
algeria
are
the
classical
examples
of
the
application
of
these
methods
by
capitalism
the
ancient
economic
organisations
of
the
indians
the
communist
village
community
had
been
preserved
in
their
various
forms
throughout
thousands
of
years
in
spite
of
all
the
political
disturbances
during
their
long
history
in
the
sixth
century
the
persians
invaded
the
indus
basin
and
subjected
part
of
the
country
two
centuries
later
the
greeks
entered
and
left
behind
them
colonies
founded
by
alexander
on
the
pattern
of
a
completely
alien
civilisation
then
the
savage
scythians
invaded
the
country
and
for
centuries
india
remained
under
arab
rule
later
the
afghans
swooped
down
from
the
iran
mountains
until
they
too
were
expelled
by
the
ruthless
onslaught
of
tartar
hordes
the
mongols
path
was
marked
by
terror
and
destruction
by
the
massacre
of
entire
villages
the
peaceful
countryside
with
the
tender
shoots
of
rice
made
crimson
with
blood
and
still
the
indian
village
community
survived
for
none
of
the
successive
mahometan
conquerors
had
ultimately
violated
the
internal
social
life
of
the
peasant
masses
and
its
traditional
structure
they
only
set
up
their
own
governors
in
the
provinces
to
supervise
military
organisation
and
to
collect
taxes
from
the
population
all
conquerors
pursued
the
aim
of
dominating
and
exploiting
the
country
but
none
was
interested
in
robbing
the
people
of
their
productive
forces
and
in
destroying
their
social
organisation
in
the
moghul
empire
the
peasant
had
to
pay
his
annual
tribute
in
kind
to
the
foreign
ruler
but
he
could
live
undisturbed
in
his
village
and
could
cultivate
his
rice
on
his
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
then
came
the
british
and
the
blight
of
capitalist
civilisation
succeeded
in
disrupting
the
entire
social
organisation
of
the
people
it
achieved
in
a
short
time
what
thousands
of
years
what
the
sword
of
the
nogaians
had
failed
to
accomplish
the
ultimate
purpose
of
british
capital
was
to
possess
itself
of
the
very
basis
of
existence
of
the
indian
community
the
land
this
end
was
served
above
all
by
the
fiction
always
popular
with
european
colonisers
that
all
the
land
of
a
colony
belongs
to
the
political
ruler
in
retrospect
the
british
endowed
the
moghul
and
his
governors
with
private
ownership
of
the
whole
of
india
in
order
to
their
succession
economic
experts
of
the
highest
repute
such
as
james
mill
duly
supported
this
fiction
with
arguments
so
in
particular
with
the
famous
conclusion
given
below
as
early
as
the
british
in
bengal
gave
landed
property
to
all
the
mahometan
tax
collectors
or
hereditary
market
superintendents
they
had
found
in
their
district
so
as
to
win
native
support
for
the
campaign
against
the
peasant
masses
later
they
adopted
the
same
policy
for
their
new
conquests
in
the
agram
province
in
oudh
and
in
the
central
provinces
turbulent
peasant
risings
followed
in
their
wake
in
the
course
of
which
tax
collectors
were
frequently
driven
out
in
the
resulting
confusion
and
anarchy
british
capitalists
successfully
appropriated
a
considerable
portion
of
the
land
the
burden
of
taxation
moreover
was
so
ruthlessly
increased
that
it
swallowed
up
nearly
all
the
fruits
of
the
people
labour
this
went
to
such
an
extreme
in
the
delhi
and
allahabad
districts
that
according
to
the
official
evidence
of
the
british
tax
authorities
in
the
peasants
found
it
convenient
to
lease
or
pledge
their
shares
in
land
for
the
bare
amount
of
the
tax
levied
under
the
auspices
of
this
taxation
usury
came
to
the
indian
village
to
stay
and
eat
up
the
social
organisation
from
within
like
a
canker
in
order
to
accelerate
this
process
the
british
passed
a
law
that
flew
in
the
face
of
every
tradition
and
justice
known
to
the
village
community
compulsory
alienation
of
village
land
for
tax
arrears
in
vain
did
the
old
family
associations
try
to
protect
themselves
by
options
on
their
hereditary
land
and
that
of
their
kindred
there
was
no
stopping
the
rot
every
day
another
plot
of
land
fell
under
the
hammer
individual
members
withdrew
from
the
family
unit
and
the
peasants
got
into
debt
and
lost
their
land
the
british
with
their
wonted
colonial
stratagems
tried
to
make
it
appear
as
if
their
power
policy
which
had
in
fact
undermined
the
traditional
forms
of
landownership
and
brought
about
the
collapse
of
the
hindu
peasant
economy
had
been
dictated
by
the
need
to
protect
the
peasants
against
native
oppression
and
exploitation
and
served
to
safeguard
their
own
interests
britain
artificially
created
a
landed
aristocracy
at
the
expense
of
the
ancient
of
the
peasant
communities
and
then
proceeded
to
the
peasants
against
these
alleged
oppressors
and
to
bring
this
illegally
usurped
land
into
the
possession
of
british
capitalists
thus
large
estates
developed
in
india
in
a
short
time
while
over
large
areas
the
peasants
in
their
masses
were
turned
into
impoverished
small
tenants
with
a
lease
lastly
one
more
striking
fact
shows
the
typically
capitalist
method
of
colonisation
the
british
were
the
first
conquerors
of
india
who
showed
gross
indifference
to
public
utilities
arabs
afghans
and
mongols
had
organised
and
maintained
magnificent
works
of
canalisation
in
india
they
had
given
the
country
a
network
of
roads
spanned
the
rivers
with
bridges
and
seen
to
the
sinking
of
wells
timur
or
tamerlane
the
founder
of
the
mongol
dynasty
in
india
had
a
care
for
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
for
irrigation
for
the
safety
of
the
roads
and
the
provision
of
food
for
travellers
the
primitive
indian
rajahs
the
afghan
or
mongol
conquerors
at
any
rate
in
spite
of
occasional
cruelty
against
individuals
made
their
mark
with
the
marvellous
constructions
we
can
find
at
every
step
and
which
seem
to
be
the
work
of
a
giant
race
east
india
company
which
ruled
india
until
did
not
make
one
spring
accessible
did
not
sink
a
single
well
nor
build
a
bridge
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
another
witness
the
englishman
james
wilson
says
the
madras
province
can
help
being
impressed
by
the
magnificent
ancient
irrigation
systems
traces
of
which
have
been
preserved
until
our
time
locks
and
weirs
dam
the
rivers
into
great
lakes
from
which
canals
distribute
the
water
for
an
area
of
or
miles
around
on
the
large
rivers
there
are
to
of
such
weirs
the
rain
water
from
the
mountains
was
collected
in
artificial

many
of
which
still
remain
and
boast
circumferences
of
between
and
miles
nearly
all
these
gigantic
constructions
were
completed
before
the
year
during
the
war
between
the
company
and
the
mongol
rulers
and
be
it
said
the
entire
period
of
our
rule
in
they
have
sadly
decayed
no
wonder
british
capital
had
no
object
in
giving
the
indian
communities
economic
support
or
helping
them
to
survive
quite
the
reverse
it
aimed
to
destroy
them
and
to
deprive
them
of
their
productive
forces
the
unbridled
greed
the
acquisitive
instinct
of
accumulation
must
by
its
very
nature
take
every
advantage
of
the
of
the
market
and
can
have
no
thought
for
the
morrow
it
is
incapable
of
seeing
far
enough
to
recognise
the
value
of
the
economic
monuments
of
an
older
civilisation
recently
british
engineers
in
egypt
feverishly
tried
to
discover
traces
of
an
ancient
irrigation
system
rather
like
the
one
a
stupid
lack
of
vision
had
allowed
to
decay
in
india
when
they
were
charged
with
damming
the
nile
on
a
grand
scale
in
furtherance
of
capitalist
enterprise
not
until
was
england
able
to
appreciate
the
results
of
her
noble
efforts
in
this
respect
in
the
terrible
famine
of
that
year
a
million
people
were
killed
in
the
orissa
district
alone
and
parliament
was
shocked
into
investigating
the
causes
of
the
emergency
the
british
government
has
now
introduced
administrative
measures
in
an
attempt
to
save
the
peasant
from
usury
the
punjab
alienation
act
of
made
it
illegal
to
sell
or
mortgage
peasant
lands
to
persons
other
than
of
the
peasant
caste
though
exceptions
can
be
made
in
individual
cases
subject
to
the
tax
collector
approval
having
deliberately
disrupted
the
protecting
ties
of
the
ancient
hindu
social
associations
after
having
nurtured
a
system
of
usury
where
nothing
is
thought
of
a
per
cent
charge
of
interest
the
british
now
entrust
the
ruined
indian
peasant
to
the
tender
care
of
the
exchequer
and
its
officials
under
the
that
is
to
say
of
those
draining
him
of
his
livelihood
next
to
tormented
british
india
algeria
under
french
rule
claims
pride
of
place
in
the
annals
of
capitalist
colonisation
when
the
french
conquered
algeria
ancient
social
and
economic
institutions
prevailed
among
the
population
these
had
been
preserved
until
the
nineteenth
century
and
in
spite
of
the
long
and
turbulent
history
of
the
country
they
survive
in
part
even
to
the
present
day
private
property
may
have
existed
no
doubt
in
the
towns
among
the
moors
and
jews
among
merchants
artisans
and
usurers
large
rural
areas
may
have
been
seized
by
the
state
under
turkish
suzerainty
yet
nearly
half
of
the
productive
land
is
jointly
held
by
arab
and
kabyle
tribes
who
still
keep
up
the
ancient
patriarchal
customs
many
arab
families
led
the
same
kind
of
nomad
life
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
they
had
done
since
time
immemorial
an
existence
that
appears
restless
and
irregular
only
to
the
superficial
observer
but
one
that
is
in
fact
strictly
regulated
and
extremely
monotonous
in
summer
they
were
wont
man
woman
and
child
to
take
their
herds
and
tents
and
migrate
to
the
shores
of
the
tell
district
and
in
the
winter
they
would
move
back
again
to
the
protective
warmth
of
the
desert
they
travelled
along
definite
routes
and
the
summer
and
winter
stations
were
fixed
for
every
tribe
and
family
the
fields
of
those
arabs
who
had
settled
on
the
land
were
in
most
cases
the
joint
property
of
the
clans
and
the
great
kabyle
family
associations
also
lived
according
to
old
traditional
rules
under
the
patriarchal
guidance
of
their
elected
heads
the
women
would
take
turns
for
household
duties
a
matriarch
again
elected
by
the
family
being
in
complete
charge
of
the
clan
domestic
affairs
or
else
the
women
taking
turns
of
duty
this
organisation
of
the
kabyle
clans
on
the
fringe
of
the
african
desert
bears
a
startling
resemblance
to
that
of
the
famous
southern
slavonic
not
only
the
fields
but
all
the
tools
weapons
and
monies
all
that
the
members
acquire
or
need
for
their
work
are
communal
property
of
the
clan
personal
property
is
confined
to
one
suit
of
clothing
and
in
the
case
of
a
woman
to
the
dresses
and
ornaments
of
her
dowry
more
valuable
attire
and
jewels
however
are
considered
common
property
and
individuals
were
allowed
to
use
them
only
if
the
whole
family
approved
if
the
clan
was
not
too
numerous
meals
were
taken
at
a
common
table
the
women
took
it
in
turns
to
cook
but
the
eldest
were
entrusted
with
the
dishing
out
if
a
family
circle
was
too
large
the
head
of
the
family
would
each
month
ration
out
strictly
proportionate
quantities
of
uncooked
food
to
the
individual
families
who
then
prepared
them
these
communities
were
bound
together
by
close
ties
of
kinship
mutual
assistance
and
equality
and
a
patriarch
would
implore
his
sons
on
his
deathbed
to
remain
faithful
to
the
family
these
social
relations
were
already
seriously
impaired
by
the
rule
of
the
turks
established
in
algeria
in
the
sixteenth
century
yet
the
turkish
exchequer
had
by
no
means
confiscated
all
the
land
that
is
a
legend
invented
by
the
french
at
a
much
later
date
indeed
only
a
european
mind
is
capable
of
such
a
flight
of
fancy
which
is
contrary
to
the
entire
economic
foundation
of
islam
both
in
theory
and
practice
in
truth
the
facts
were
quite
different
the
turks
did
not
touch
the
communal
fields
of
the
village
communities
they
merely
confiscated
a
great
part
of
uncultivated
land
from
the
clans
and
converted
it
into
crownland
under
turkish
local
administrators
the
state
worked
these
lands
in
part
with
native
labour
and
in
part
they
were
leased
out
on
rent
or
against
payment
in
kind
further
the
turks
took
advantage
of
every
revolt
of
the
subjected
families
and
of
every
disturbance
in
the
country
to
add
to
their
possessions
by
confiscation
of
land
either
for
military
establishments
or
for
public
auction
when
most
of
it
went
to
turkish
or
other
usurers
to
escape
from
the
burden
of
taxation
and
confiscation
many
peasants
placed
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
church
just
as
they
had
done
in
medieval
germany
hence
considerable
areas
became
all
these
changes
finally
resulted
in
the
following
distribution
of
algerian
land
at
the
time
of
the
french
conquest
crownlands
occupied
nearly
acres
and
a
further
acres
of
uncultivated
land
as
common
property
of
all
the
faithful
acres
had
been
privately
owned
by
the
berbers
since
roman
times
and
under
turkish
rule
a
further
acres
had
come
into
private
ownership
a
mere
acres
remaining
communal
property
of
individual
arab
clans
in
the
sahara
some
of
the
acres
fertile
land
near
the
sahara
oases
was
communally
owned
by
the
clans
and
some
belonged
to
private
owners
the
remaining
acres
were
mainly
waste
land
with
their
conquest
of
algeria
the
french
made
a
great
ado
about
their
work
of
civilisation
since
the
country
having
shaken
off
the
turkish
yoke
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
harbouring
the
pirates
who
infested
the
mediterranean
and
trafficked
in
christian
slaves
spain
and
the
north
american
union
in
particular
themselves
at
that
time
slave
traders
on
no
mean
scale
declared
relentless
war
on
this
moslem
iniquity
france
in
the
very
throes
of
the
great
revolution
proclaimed
a
crusade
against
algerian
anarchy
her
subjection
of
that
country
was
carried
through
under
the
slogans
of
slavery
and
orderly
and
civilised
conditions
yet
practice
was
soon
to
show
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
it
is
common
knowledge
that
in
the
forty
years
following
the
subjection
of
algeria
no
european
state
suffered
so
many
changes
in
its
political
system
as
france
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
was
followed
by
the
july
revolution
and
the
reign
of
the
king
and
this
was
succeeded
by
the
february
revolution
the
second
republic
the
second
empire
and
finally
after
the
disaster
of
by
the
third
republic
in
turn
the
aristocracy
high
finance
petty
bourgeoisie
and
the
large
middle
classes
in
general
gained
political
ascendancy
yet
french
policy
in
algeria
remained
undeflected
by
this
succession
of
events
it
pursued
a
single
aim
from
beginning
to
end
at
the
fringe
of
the
african
desert
it
demonstrated
plainly
that
all
the
political
revolutions
in
france
centred
in
a
single
basic
interest
the
rule
of
a
capitalist
bourgeoisie
and
its
institutions
of
ownership
bill
submitted
for
your
consideration
said
deputy
humbert
on
june
in
the
session
of
the
french
national
assembly
as
spokesman
for
the
commission
for
regulating
agrarian
conditions
in
algeria
but
the
crowning
touch
to
an
edifice
on
a
whole
series
of
ordinances
edicts
laws
and
decrees
of
the
senate
which
together
and
severally
have
as
the
same
object
the
establishment
of
private
property
among
the
arabs
in
spite
of
the
ups
and
downs
of
internal
french
politics
french
colonial
policy
persevered
for
fifty
years
in
its
systematic
and
deliberate
efforts
to
destroy
and
disrupt
communal
property
it
served
two
distinct
purposes
the
of
communal
property
was
primarily
intended
to
smash
the
social
power
of
the
arab
family
associations
and
to
quell
their
stubborn
resistance
against
the
french
yoke
in
the
course
of
which
there
were
innumerable
risings
so
that
in
spite
of
france
military
superiority
the
country
was
in
a
continual
state
of
war
secondly
communal
property
had
to
be
disrupted
in
order
to
gain
the
economic
assets
of
the
conquered
country
the
arabs
that
is
to
say
had
to
be
deprived
of
the
land
they
had
owned
for
a
thousand
years
so
that
french
capitalists
could
get
it
once
again
the
fiction
we
know
so
well
that
under
moslem
law
all
land
belongs
to
the
ruler
was
brought
into
play
just
as
the
english
had
done
in
british
india
so
louis
philippe
governors
in
algeria
declared
the
existence
of
communal
property
owned
by
the
clan
to
be
this
fiction
served
as
an
excuse
to
claim
for
the
state
most
of
the
uncultivated
areas
and
especially
the
commons
woods
and
meadows
and
to
use
them
for
purposes
of
colonisation
a
complete
system
of
settlement
developed
the
which
settled
french
colonists
on
the
clan
land
and
herded
the
tribes
into
a
small
area
under
the
decrees
of
and
these
thefts
of
arab
family
land
were
legalised
yet
this
system
of
settlement
did
not
actually
further
colonisation
it
only
bred
wild
speculation
and
usury
in
most
instances
the
arabs
managed
to
buy
back
the
land
that
had
been
taken
from
them
although
they
were
thus
incurring
heavy
debts
french
methods
of
oppressive
taxation
had
the
same
tendency
in
particular
the
law
of
june
proclaiming
all
forests
to
be
state
property
which
robbed
the
natives
of
acres
of
pasture
and
brushwood
and
took
away
the
prime
essential
for
animal
husbandry
this
spate
of
laws
ordinances
and
regulations
wrought
havoc
with
the
ownership
of
land
in
the
country
under
the
prevailing
condition
of
feverish
speculation
in
land
many
natives
sold
their
estates
to
the
french
in
the
hope
of
ultimately
recovering
them
quite
often
they
sold
the
same
plot
to
two
or
three
buyers
at
a
time
and
what
is
more
it
was
quite
often
inalienable
family
land
and
did
not
even
belong
to
them
a
company
of
speculators
from
rouen
believed
that
they
had
bought
acres
but
in
fact
they
had
only
acquired
a
disputed
title
to
acres
there
followed
an
infinite
number
of
lawsuits
in
which
the
french
courts
supported
on
principle
all
partitions
and
claims
of
the
buyers
in
these
uncertain
conditions
speculation
usury
and
anarchy
were
rife
but
although
the
introduction
of
french
colonists
in
large
numbers
among
the
arab
population
had
aimed
at
securing
support
for
the
french
government
this
scheme
failed
miserably
thus
under
the
second
empire
french
policy
tried
another
tack
the
government
with
its
european
lack
of
vision
had
stubbornly
denied
the
existence
of
communal
property
for
thirty
years
but
it
had
learned
better
at
last
by
a
single
stroke
of
the
pen
joint
family
property
was
officially
recognised
and
condemned
to
be
broken
up
this
is
the
double
significance
of
the
decree
of
the
senate
dated
april
general
allard
declared
in
the
senate
government
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
general
aim
of
its
policy
is
to
weaken
the
influence
of
the
tribal
chieftains
and
to
dissolve
the
family
associations
by
this
means
it
will
sweep
away
the
last
remnants
of
feudalism
defended
by
the
opponents
of
the
government
bill
the
surest
method
of
accelerating
the
process
of
dissolving
the
family
associations
will
be
to
institute
private
property
and
to
settle
european
colonists
among
the
arab
families
the
law
of
created
special
commissions
for
cutting
up
the
landed
estates
consisting
of
the
chairman
either
a
or
colonel
one
one
representative
of
the
arab
military
authorities
and
an
official
bailiff
these
natural
experts
on
african
economics
and
social
conditions
were
faced
with
the
threefold
task
first
of
determining
the
precise
boundaries
of
the
great
family
estates
secondly
to
distribute
the
estates
of
each
clan
among
its
various
branches
and
finally
to
break
up
this
family
land
into
separate
private
allotments
this
expedition
of
the
brigadiers
into
the
interior
of
africa
duly
took
place
the
commissions
proceeded
to
their
destinations
they
were
to
combine
the
office
of
judge
in
all
land
disputes
with
that
of
surveyor
and
land
distributor
the
final
decision
resting
with
the
of
algeria
ten
years
valiant
efforts
by
the
commissions
yielded
the
following
result
between
and
of
hereditary
estates
were
shared
out
among
the
branches
of
each
clan
and
the
foundations
for
future
inequalities
between
great
landed
estates
and
small
allotments
were
thus
laid
one
family
in
fact
might
receive
between
and
acres
while
another
might
get
as
much
as
or
even
acres
depending
on
the
size
of
the
estate
and
the
number
of
collaterals
within
the
clan
partition
however
stopped
at
that
point
arab
customs
presented
unsurmountable
difficulties
to
a
further
division
of
family
land
in
spite
of
colonels
and
brigadiers
french
policy
had
again
failed
in
its
object
to
create
private
property
for
transfer
to
the
french
but
the
third
republic
an
undisguised
regime
of
the
bourgeoisie
had
the
courage
and
the
cynicism
to
go
straight
for
its
goal
and
to
attack
the
problem
from
the
other
end
disdaining
the
preliminaries
of
the
second
empire
in
the
national
assembly
worked
out
a
law
with
the
avowed
intention
immediately
to
split
up
the
entire
estates
of
all
the
arab
clans
and
forcibly
to
institute
private
property
in
the
shortest
possible
time
desperate
conditions
in
the
colony
were
the
pretext
for
this
measure
it
had
taken
the
great
indian
famine
of
to
awaken
the
british
public
to
the
marvellous
exploits
of
british
colonial
policy
and
to
call
for
a
parliamentary
investigation
and
similarly
europe
was
alarmed
at
the
end
of
the
sixties
by
the
crying
needs
of
algeria
where
more
than
forty
years
of
french
rule
culminated
in
famine
and
a
disastrous
mortality
rate
among
the
arabs
a
commission
of
inquiry
was
set
up
to
recommend
new
legislation
with
which
to
bless
the
arabs
it
was
unanimously
resolved
that
there
was
only
one
for
them
the
institution
of
private
property
that
alone
could
save
the
arab
from
destitution
since
he
would
then
always
be
able
to
sell
or
mortgage
his
land
it
was
decided
therefore
that
the
only
means
of
alleviating
the
distress
of
the
arabs
deeply
involved
in
debts
as
they
were
because
of
the
french
land
robberies
and
oppressive
taxation
was
to
deliver
them
completely
into
the
hands
of
the
usurers
this
farce
was
expounded
in
all
seriousness
before
the
national
assembly
and
was
accepted
with
equal
gravity
by
that
worthy
body
the
of
the
paris
commune
flaunted
their
brazenness
in
the
national
assembly
two
arguments
in
particular
served
to
support
the
new
law
those
in
favour
of
the
bill
emphasised
over
and
over
again
that
the
arabs
themselves
urgently
desired
the
introduction
of
private
property
and
so
they
did
or
rather
the
algerian
land
speculators
and
usurers
did
since
they
were
vitally
interested
in
their
victims
from
the
protection
of
the
family
ties
as
long
as
moslem
law
prevailed
in

hereditary
clan
and
family
lands
were
inalienable
which
laid
insuperable
difficulties
in
the
way
of
anyone
who
wished
to
mortgage
his
land
the
law
of
had
merely
made
a
breach
in
these
obstacles
and
the
issue
now
at
stake
was
their
complete
abolition
so
as
to
give
a
free
hand
to
the
usurers
the
second
argument
was
part
of
the
same
intellectual
equipment
from
which
that
worthy
james
mill
had
drawn
for
his
abstruse
conclusions
regarding
indian
relations
of
ownership
english
classical
economics
thoroughly
versed
in
their
masters
teachings
the
disciples
of
smith
and
ricardo
impressively
declaimed
that
private
property
is
indispensable
for
the
prevention
of
famines
in
algeria
for
more
intensive
and
better
cultivation
of
the
land
since
obviously
no
one
would
be
prepared
to
invest
capital
or
intensive
labour
in
a
piece
of
land
which
does
not
belong
to
him
and
whose
produce
is
not
his
own
to
enjoy
but
the
facts
spoke
a
different
language
they
proved
that
the
french
speculators
employed
the
private
property
they
had
created
in
algeria
for
anything
but
the
more
intensive
and
improved
cultivation
of
the
soil
in
acres
were
french
property
but
the
capitalist
companies
the
algerian
and
setif
company
which
owned
acres
did
not
cultivate
the
land
at
all
but
leased
it
to
the
natives
who
tilled
it
in
the
traditional
manner
nor
were
per
cent
of
the
other
french
owners
engaged
in
agriculture
it
was
simply
impossible
to
conjure
up
capitalist
investments
and
intensive
agriculture
overnight
just
as
capitalist
conditions
in
general
could
not
be
created
out
of
nothing
they
existed
only
in
the
imagination
of
french
speculators
and
in
the
benighted
doctrinaire
visions
of
their
scientific
economists
the
essential
point
shorn
of
all
pretexts
and
flourishes
which
seem
to
justify
the
law
of
was
simply
the
desire
to
deprive
the
arabs
of
their
land
their
livelihood
and
although
these
arguments
had
worn
threadbare
and
were
evidently
insincere
this
law
which
was
to
put
paid
to
the
algerian
population
and
their
material
prosperity
was
passed
unanimously
on
july
but
even
this
soon
proved
a
failure
the
policy
of
the
third
republic
miscarried
because
of
the
difficulties
in
substituting
at
one
stroke
bourgeois
private
property
for
the
ancient
clan
communism
just
as
the
policy
of
the
second
empire
had
come
to
grief
over
the
same
issue
in
when
the
law
of
july
supplemented
by
a
second
law
on
april
had
been
in
force
for
seventeen
years
francs
had
been
spent
on
dealing
with
acres
it
was
estimated
that
the
process
would
not
be
completed
before
and
would
require
a
further
francs
and
still
abolition
of
clan
communism
the
ultimate
purpose
had
not
been
accomplished
what
had
really
been
attained
was
all
too
evident
reckless
speculation
in
land
thriving
usury
and
the
economic
ruin
of
the
natives
since
it
had
been
impossible
to
institute
private
property
by
force
a
new
experiment
was
undertaken
the
laws
of
and
had
been
condemned
by
a
commission
appointed
for
their
revision
by
the
algerian
government
in
it
was
another
seven
years
before
the
legislators
on
the
seine
made
the
effort
to
consider
reforms
for
the
ruined
country
the
new
decree
of
the
senate
refrained
in
principle
from
instituting
private
property
by
compulsion
or
administrative
measures
the
laws
of
february
and
the
edict
of
the
of
algeria
march
both
provided
chiefly
for
the
introduction
of
private
property
following
a
voluntary
application
by
the
prospective
purchaser
or
owner
but
there
were
clauses
to
permit
a
single
owner
without
the
consent
of
the
others
to
claim
private
property
further
such
a
application
can
be
extorted
at
any
convenient
moment
if
the
owner
is
in
debt
and
the
usurer
exerts
pressure
and
so
the
new
law
left
the
doors
wide
open
for
french
and
native
capitalists
further
to
disrupt
and
exploit
the
hereditary
and
clan
lands
of
recent
years
this
mutilation
of
algeria
which
had
been
going
on
for
eight
decades
meets
with
even
less
opposition
since
the
arabs
surrounded
as
they
are
by
french
capital
following
the
subjection
of
tunisia
and
the
recent
conquest
of
morocco
have
been
rendered
more
and
more
helpless
the
latest
result
of
the
french
regime
in
algeria
is
an
arab
exodus

soon
as
they
are
given
the
pipe
they
inhale
a
few
puffs
and
are
cured
immediately
has
therefore
become
a
necessity
for
all
who
smoke
it
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
under
by
the
local
authorities
they
will
submit
to
every
punishment
rather
than
reveal
the
names
of
their
suppliers
local
authorities
are
also
in
some
cases
given
presents
to
tolerate
the
evil
or
to
delay
any
investigation
already
under
way
most
merchants
who
bring
goods
for
sale
into
canton
also
deal
in
smuggled
opium
am
of
the
opinion
that
opium
is
by
far
a
greater
evil
than
gambling
and
that
opium
smokers
should
therefore
be
punished
no
less
than
gamblers
the
censor
suggested
that
every
convicted
opium
smoker
should
be
sentenced
to
eighty
strokes
of
the
bamboo
and
anybody
refusing
to
give
the
name
of
his
supplier
to
a
hundred
strokes
and
three
years
of
exile
the
pigtailed
cato
of
peking
concludes
his
report
with
a
frankness
staggering
to
any
european
official
opium
is
mostly
introduced
from
abroad
by
dishonest
officials
in
connivance
with
merchants
who
transport
it
into
the
interior
of
the
country
then
the
first
to
indulge
are
people
of
good
family
wealthy
private
persons
and
merchants
but
ultimately
the
drug
habit
spreads
among
the
common
people
i
have
learnt
that
in
all
provinces
opium
is
smoked
not
only
in
the
civil
service
but
also
in
the
army
the
officials
of
the
various
districts
indeed
enjoin
the
legal
prohibition
of
sale
by
special
edicts
but
at
the
same
time
their
parents
families
dependants
and
servants
simply
go
on
smoking
opium
and
the
merchants
profit
from
the
ban
by
increased
prices
even
the
police
have
been
won
over
they
buy
the
stuff
instead
of
helping
to
suppress
it
and
this
is
an
additional
reason
for
the
disregard
in
which
all
prohibitions
and
ordinances
are
held
consequently
a
stricter
law
was
passed
in
which
made
every
opium
smoker
liable
to
a
hundred
strokes
and
two
months
in
the
stocks
and
provincial
governors
were
ordered
to
report
annually
on
their
progress
in
the
battle
against
opium
but
there
were
two
sequels
to
this
campaign
on
the
one
hand
poppy
plantations
sprang
up
in
the
interior
particularly
in
the
honan
setchuan
and
kueitchan
provinces
and
on
the
other
england
declared
war
on
china
to
get
her
to
lift
the
embargo
these
were
the
splendid
beginnings
of
china
to
european
civilisation
by
the
opium
pipe
canton
was
the
first
objective
the
fortifications
of
the
town
at
the
main
arm
of
the
perl
estuary
could
not
have
been
more
primitive
every
day
at
sunset
a
barrier
of
iron
chains
was
attached
to
wooden
rafts
anchored
at
various
distances
and
this
was
the
main
defence
moreover
the
chinese
guns
could
only
fire
at
a
certain
angle
and
were
therefore
completely
ineffectual
with
such
primitive
defences
just
adequate
to
prevent
a
few
merchant
ships
from
landing
did
the
chinese
meet
the
british
attack
a
couple
of
british
cruisers
then
sufficed
to
effect
an
entry
on
september
the
sixteen
and
thirteen
which
the
chinese
put
up
for
resistance
were
shot
up
or
dispersed
in
a
matter
of
minutes
after
this
initial
victory
the
british
renewed
the
attack
in
the
beginning
of
with
a
considerably
reinforced
fleet
this
time
the
fleet
consisting
in
a
number
of
and
the
forts
were
attacked
simultaneously
the
first
incendiary
rocket
that
was
fired
penetrated
through
the
armour
casing
of
a
junk
into
the
powder
chamber
and
blew
the
ship
with
the
entire
crew
in
a
short
time
eleven
junks
including
the
were
destroyed
and
the
remainder
precipitately
made
for
safety
the
action
on
land
took
a
little
longer
since
the
chinese
guns
were
quite
useless
the
british
walked
right
through
the
fortifications
climbed
to
a
strategic
position
which
was
not
even
guarded
and
proceeded
to
slaughter
the
helpless
chinese
from
above
the
casualty
list
of
the
battle
was
for
the
chinese
dead
and
for
the
british
dead
and
wounded
more
than
half
of
the
latter
having
been
injured
by
the
accidental
explosion
of
a
powder
magazine
a
few
weeks
later
there
followed
another
british
exploit
the
forts
of
and
north
wantong
were
to
be
taken
no
less
than
twelve
fully
equipped
cruisers
were
available
for
this
task
what
is
more
the
chinese
once
again
forgetful
of
the
most
important
thing
had
omitted
to
fortify
the
island
of
south
wantong
thus
the
british
calmly
landed
a
battery
of
howitzers
to
bombard
the
fort
from
one
side
the
cruisers
shelling
it
from
the
other
after
that
the
chinese
were
driven
from
the
forts
in
a
matter
of
minutes
and
the
landing
met
with
no
resistance
the
ensuing
display
of
inhumanity
an
english
report
says
will
be
for
ever
deeply
deplored
by
the
british
staff
the
chinese
trying
to
escape
from
the
barricades
had
fallen
into
a
moat
which
was
soon
literally
filled
to
the
brim
with
helpless
soldiers
begging
for
mercy
into
this
mass
of
prostrate
human
bodies
the
sepoys
acting
against
orders
it
is
claimed
fired
again
and
again
this
is
the
way
in
which
canton
was
made
receptive
to
commodity
exchange
nor
did
the
other
ports
fare
better
on
july
three
british
cruisers
with
cannon
appeared
off
the
islands
in
the
entrance
to
the
town
of
ningpo
more
cruisers
arrived
the
following
day
in
the
evening
the
british
admiral
sent
a
message
to
the
chinese
governor
demanding
the
capitulation
of
the
island
the
governor
explained
that
he
had
no
power
to
resist
but
could
not
surrender
without
orders
from
peking
he
therefore
asked
for
a
delay
this
was
refused
and
at
two
in
the
morning
the
british
stormed
the
defenceless
island
within
eight
minutes
the
fort
and
the
houses
on
the
shore
were
reduced
to
smouldering
rubble
having
landed
on
the
deserted
coast
littered
with
broken
spears
sabres
shields
rifles
and
a
few
dead
bodies
the
troops
advanced
on
the
walls
of
the
island
town
of
tinghai
with
daybreak
reinforced
by
the
crews
of
other
ships
which
had
meanwhile
arrived
they
proceeded
to
put
to
the
scarcely
defended
ramparts
a
few
more
minutes
gave
them
mastery
of
the
town
this
splendid
victory
was
announced
with
becoming
modesty
in
an
order
of
the
day
has
decreed
that
the
morning
of
july
should
be
the
historic
date
on
which
her
majesty
flag
was
first
raised
over
the
most
beautiful
island
of
the
celestial
empire
the
first
european
flag
to
fly
triumphantly
above
this
lovely
countryside
on
august
the
british
approached
the
town
of
amoy
whose
forts
were
armed
with
a
hundred
of
the
heaviest
chinese
guns
these
guns
being
almost
useless
and
the
commanders
lacking
in
resource
the
capture
of
the
harbour
was
child
play
under
cover
of
a
heavy
barrage
british
ships
drew
near
the
walls
of
kulangau
landed
their
marines
and
after
a
short
stand
the
chinese
troops
were
driven
out
the
with
guns
in
the
harbour
were
also
captured
their
crews
having
fled
one
battery
manned
by
tartars
heroically
held
out
against
the
combined
fire
of
three
british
ships
but
a
british
landing
was
effected
in
their
rear
and
the
post
wiped
out
this
was
the
finale
of
the
notorious
opium
war
by
the
peace
treaty
of
august
the
island
of
hongkong
was
ceded
to
britain
in
addition
the
towns
of
canton
amoy
futchou
ningpo
and
shanghai
were
to
open
their
ports
to
foreign
commerce
but
within
fifteen
years
there
was
a
further
war
against
china
this
time
britain
had
joined
forces
with
the
french
in
the
allied
navies
captured
canton
with
a
heroism
equal
to
that
of
the
first
war
by
the
peace
of
tientsin
the
opium
traffic
european
commerce
and
christian
missions
were
admitted
into
the
interior
already
in
however
the
british
resumed
hostilities
and
attempted
to
destroy
the
chinese
fortifications
on
the
peiho
river
but
were
driven
off
after
a
fierce
battle
in
which
people
were
wounded
or
killed
after
that
britain
and
france
again
joined
forces
at
the
end
of
august
english
and
french
troops
under
general
first
captured
the
taku
forts
without
a
single
shot
having
been
fired
then
they
proceeded
towards
tientsin
and
on
towards
peking
a
bloody
battle
was
joined
at
palikao
and
peking
fell
to
the
european
powers
entering
the
almost
depopulated
and
completely
undefended
city
the
victors
began
by
pillaging
the
imperial
palace
manfully
helped
by
general
cousin
himself
who
was
later
to
become
field
marshal
and
count
of
palikao
then
the
palace
went
up
in
flames
fired
on
lord
elgin
order
as
an
imposed
penance
the
european
powers
now
obtained
concessions
to
set
up
embassies
in
peking
and
to
start
trading
with
tientsin
and
other
towns
the
convention
of
guaranteed
full
facilities
for
importing
opium
into
china
at
a
time
when
the
league
in
england
agitated
against
the
spreading
of
the
drug
habit
in
london
manchester
and
other
industrial
districts
when
a
parliamentary
commission
declared
the
consumption
of
opium
to
be
harmful
in
the
extreme
by
all
treaties
made
at
that
time
between
china
and
the
great
powers
any
european
whether
merchant
or
missionary
was
guaranteed
the
right
to
acquire
land
to
which
end
the
legitimate
arguments
were
ably
supported
by
deliberate
fraud
first
and
foremost
the
ambiguity
of
the
treaty
texts
made
a
convenient
excuse
for
european
capital
to
encroach
beyond
the
treaty
ports
it
used
every
loophole
in
the
wording
of
the
treaties
to
begin
with
and
subsequently
blackmailed
the
chinese
government
into
permitting
the
missions
to
acquire
land
not
alone
in
the
treaty
ports
but
in
all
the
provinces
of
the
realm
their
claim
was
based
upon
the
notorious
distortion
of
the
chinese
original
in
abbé
official
translation
of
the
supplementary
convention
with
france
french
diplomacy
and
the
protestant
missions
in
particular
unanimously
condemned
the
crafty
swindle
of
the
catholic
padre
but
nevertheless
they
were
firm
that
the
rights
of
french
missions
obtained
by
this
fraud
should
be
explicitly
extended
to
the
protestant
missions
as
well
china
entry
into
commodity
exchange
having
begun
with
the
opium
wars
was
finally
accomplished
with
a
series
of
and
the
china
campaign
of
when
the
commercial
interests
of
european
capital
sank
to
a
brazen
international
dogfight
over
chinese
land
the
description
of
the
dowager
empress
who
wrote
to
queen
victoria
after
the
capture
of
the
taku
forts
subtly
underlines
this
contrast
between
the
initial
theory
and
the
ultimate
practice
of
the
of
european
civilisation
your
majesty
greeting
in
all
the
dealings
of
england
with
the
empire
of
china
since
first
relations
were
established
between
us
there
has
never
been
any
idea
of
territorial
aggrandisement
on
the
part
of
great
britain
but
only
a
keen
desire
to
promote
the
interests
of
her
trade
reflecting
upon
the
fact
that
our
country
is
now
plunged
into
a
dreadful
condition
of
warfare
we
bear
in
mind
that
a
large
proportion
of
china
trade
seventy
or
eighty
per
cent
is
done
with
england
moreover
your
customs
duties
are
the
lightest
in
the
world
and
few
restrictions
are
made
at
your
in
the
matter
of
foreign
importations
for
these
reasons
our
amiable
relations
with
british
merchants
at
our
treaty
ports
have
continued
unbroken
for
the
last
half
century
to
our
mutual
but
a
sudden
change
has
now
occurred
and
general
suspicion
has
been
created
against
us
we
would
therefore
ask
you
now
to
consider
that
if
by
any
conceivable
combination
of
circumstances
the
independence
of
our
empire
should
be
lost
and
the
powers
unite
to
carry
out
their
schemes
to
possess
themselves
of
our
territory
in
a
simultaneous
message
to
the
emperor
of
japan
the
impulsive
tzu
hsi
openly
refers
to
powers
of
the
west
whose
tigerish
eyes
of
greed
are
fixed
in
our
direction
results
to
your
country
interests
would
be
disastrous
and
fatal
to
your
trade
at
this
moment
our
empire
is
striving
to
the
utmost
to
raise
an
army
and
funds
sufficient
for
its
protection
in
the
meanwhile
we
rely
on
your
good
services
to
act
as
mediator
and
now
anxiously
await
your
decision
both
during
the
wars
and
in
the
interim
periods
european
civilisation
was
busy
looting
and
thieving
on
a
grand
scale
in
the
chinese
imperial
palaces
in
the
public
buildings
and
in
the
monuments
of
ancient
civilisation
not
only
in
when
the
french
pillaged
the
palace
with
its
legendary
treasures
or
in
all
the
nations
vied
with
each
other
to
steal
public
and
private
property
every
european
advance
was
marked
not
only
with
the
progress
of
commodity
exchange
but
by
the
smouldering
ruins
of
the
largest
and
most
venerable
towns
by
the
decay
of
agriculture
over
large
rural
areas
and
by
intolerably
oppressive
taxation
for

contributions
there
are
more
than

every

has
been
paid

to

for
long

there
has

between
them
and

but
three
years
ago
the
english
for
no
good
cause
invaded
our
city
of
canton
and
carried
off
our
officials
into
captivity
we
refrained
at
that
time
from
taking
any
retaliatory
measures
because
we
were
compelled
to
recognise
that
the
obstinacy
of
the
viceroy
yeh
had
been
in
some
measure
a
cause
of
the
hostilities
two
years
ago
the
barbarian
commander
elgin
came
north
and
we
then
commanded
the
viceroy
of
chihli
to
look
into
matters
preparatory
to
negotiations
but
the
barbarian
took
advantage
of
our
unreadiness
attacking
the
taku
forts
and
pressing
on
to
tientsin
being
anxious
to
spare
our
people
the
horrors
of
war
we
again
refrained
from
retaliation
and
ordered
kuei
liang
to
discuss
terms
of
peace
notwithstanding
the
outrageous
nature
of
the
barbarians
demands
we
subsequently
ordered
kuei
liang
to
proceed
to
shanghai
in
connection
with
the
proposed
treaty
of
commerce
and
even
permitted
its
ratification
as
earnest
of
our
good
faith
spite
of
all
this
the
barbarian
leader
bruce
again
displayed
intractability
of
the
most
unreasonable
kind

once

appeared
off

eighth

seng
ko
lin
thereupon
attacked
him
fiercely
and
compelled
him
to
make
a
rapid
retreat
from
all
these
facts
it
is
clear
that
china
has
committed
no
breach
of
faith
and
that
the
barbarians
have
been
in
the
wrong
during
the
present
year
the
barbarian
leaders
elgin
and
gros
have
again
appeared
off
our
coasts

china
unwilling
to
resort
to
extreme
measures
agreed
to
their
landing

permitted
them
to
come
to
peking
for
the
ratification
of

have
believed
that
all

the
barbarians
have
been
darkly
plotting

that
they
had
brought
with
them
an
army
of

they
attacked

internal

straight
from

the

summer

the
of

went
on

the

the
work
of

while
a
considerable
number
of
europeans
among

a
french
admiral
gave
their
lives
to
preserve
china
for
the
manchu
dynasty
the
representatives

were
eagerly

fights
supplying
arms
both
to
their
own
champions
and
to
the
rebels
who
went
to

the
worthy

was
tempted
by
the
opportunity
for

the
struggle
against
peasant
economy
an
important
final
phase
in
the
campaign
against
natural
economy
is
to
separate
industry
from
agriculture
to
eradicate
rural
industries
altogether
from
peasant
economy
handicraft
in
its
historical
beginnings
was
a
subsidiary
occupation
a
mere
appendage
to
agriculture
in
civilised
and
settled
societies
in
medieval
europe
it
became
gradually
independent
of
the
farm
and
agriculture
it
developed
into
specialised
occupations
production
of
commodities
by
urban
guilds
in
industrial
districts
production
had
progressed
from
home
craft
by
way
of
primitive
manufacture
to
the
capitalist
factory
of
the
staple
industries
but
in
the
rural
areas
under
peasant
economy
home
crafts
persisted
as
an
intrinsic
part
of
agriculture
every
hour
that
could
be
spared
from
cultivating
the
soil
was
devoted
to
handicrafts
which
as
an
auxiliary
domestic
industry
played
an
important
part
in
providing
for
personal
needs
it
is
a
recurrent
phenomenon
in
the
development
of
capitalist
production
that
one
branch
of
industry
after
the
other
is
singled
out
isolated
from
agriculture
and
concentrated
in
factories
for
mass
production
the
textile
industry
provides
the
textbook
example
but
the
same
thing
has
happened
though
less
obviously
in
the
case
of
other
rural
industries
capital
must
get
the
peasants
to
buy
its
commodities
and
will
therefore
begin
by
restricting
peasant
economy
to
a
single
sphere
that
of
agriculture
which
will
not
immediately
and
under
european
conditions
of
ownership
only
with
great
difficulty
submit
to
capitalist
domination
to
all
outward
appearance
this
process
is
quite
peaceful
it
is
scarcely
noticeable
and
seemingly
caused
by
purely
economic
factors
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
mass
production
in
the
factories
is
technically
superior
to
primitive
peasant
industry
owing
to
a
higher
degree
of
specialisation
scientific
analysis
and
management
of
the
productive
process
improved
machinery
and
access
to
international
resources
of
raw
materials
in
reality
however
the
process
of
separating
agriculture
and
industry
is
determined
by
factors
such
as
oppressive
taxation
war
or
squandering
and
monopolisation
of
the
nation
land
and
thus
belongs
to
the
spheres
of
political
power
and
criminal
law
no
less
than
with
economics
nowhere
has
this
process
been
brought
to
such
perfection
as
in
the
united
states
in
the
wake
of
the
railways
financed
by
european
and
in
particular
british
capital
the
american
farmer
crossed
the
union
from
east
to
west
and
in
his
progress
over
vast
areas
killed
off
the
red
indians
with
and
liquor
and
venereal
disease
pushing
the
survivors
to
the
west
in
order
to
appropriate
the
land
they
had
to
clear
it
and
bring
it
under
the
plough
the
american
farmer
the
of
the
good
old
times
before
the
war
of
secession
was
very
different
indeed
from
his
modern
counterpart
there
was
hardly
anything
he
could
not
do
and
he
led
a
practically
life
on
his
isolated
farm
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineties
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
alliance
senator
peffer
wrote
as
follows
american
farmer
of
is
altogether
a
different
sort
of
man
from
his
ancestor
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
ago
a
great
many
men
and
women
now
living
remember
when
farmers
were
largely
manufacturers
that
is
to
say
they
made
a
great
many
implements
for
their
own
use
every
farmer
had
an
assortment
of
tools
with
which
he
made
wooden
implements
as
forks
and
rakes
handles
for
his
hoes
and
ploughs
spokes
for
his
wagon
and
various
other
implements
made
wholly
out
of
wood
then
the
farmer
produced
flax
and
hemp
and
wool
and
cotton
these
fibres
were
prepared
upon
the
farm
they
were
spun
into
yarn
woven
into
cloth
made
into
garments
and
worn
at
home
every
farm
had
upon
it
a
little
shop
for
wood
and
iron
work
and
in
the
dwelling
were
cards
and
looms
carpets
were
woven
of
different
sorts
was
prepared
upon
every
farm
geese
were
kept
their
feathers
used
for
supplying
the
home
demand
with
beds
and
pillows
the
surplus
being
disposed
of
at
the
nearest
market
town
during
the
winter
season
wheat
and
flour
and
corn
meal
were
carried
in
large
wagons
drawn
by
teams
of
six
to
eight
horses
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
miles
to
market
and
traded
for
farm
supplies
for
the
next
year
groceries
and
dry
goods
besides
this
mechanics
were
scattered
among
the
farmers
the
farm
wagon
was
in
process
of
building
a
year
or
two
the
material
was
found
near
the
shop
the
character
of
the
timber
to
be
used
was
stated
in
the
contract
it
had
to
be
procured
in
a
certain
season
and
kept
in
the
drying
process
a
length
of
time
specified
so
that
when
the
material
was
brought
together
in
proper
form
and
the
wagon
made
both
parties
to
the
contract
knew
where
every
stick
of
it
came
from
and
how
long
it
had
been
in
seasoning
during
winter
time
the
neighbourhood
carpenter
prepared
sashes
and
blinds
and
doors
and
moulding
and
cornices
for
the
next
season
building
when
the
frosts
of
autumn
came
the
shoemaker
repaired
to
the
dwellings
of
the
farmers
and
there
in
a
corner
set
apart
to
him
he
made
up
shoes
for
the
family
during
the
winter
all
these
things
were
done
among
the
farmers
and
a
large
part
of
the
expense
was
paid
with
products
of
the
farm
when
winter
approached
the
butchering
season
was
at
hand
meat
for
family
use
during
the
next
year
was
prepared
and
preserved
in
the
smoke
house
the
orchards
supplied
fruit
for
cider
for
apple
butter
and
for
preserves
of
different
kinds
amply
sufficient
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
family
during
the
year
with
some
to
spare
wheat
was
threshed
a
little
at
a
time
just
enough
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
family
for
ready
money
and
not
enough
to
make
it
necessary
to
waste
one
stalk
of
straw
everything
was
saved
and
put
to
use
one
of
the
results
of
that
sort
of
economy
was
that
comparatively
a
very
small
amount
of
money
was
required
to
conduct
the
business
of
farming
a
hundred
dollars
average
probably
was
as
much
as
the
largest
farmers
of
that
day
needed
in
the
way
of
cash
to
meet
the
demands
of
their
farm
work
paying
for
hired
help
repairs
of
tools
and
all
other
incidental
expenses
this
arcadian
life
was
to
come
to
a
sudden
end
after
the
war
of
secession
the
war
had
burdened
the
union
with
an
enormous
national
debt
amounting
to
and
in
consequence
the
taxes
were
considerably
increased
on
the
other
hand
a
feverish
development
of
modern
traffic
and
industry
in
particular
was
encouraged
by
the
imposition
of
higher
protective
tariffs
the
railway
companies
were
endowed
with
public
lands
on
an
imposing
scale
in
order
to
promote
railroad
construction
and
in
alone
they
were
given
more
than
acres
and
so
the
permanent
way
grew
at
an
unprecedented
rate
in
it
amounted
to
less
than
miles
in
it
had
grown
to
more
than
miles
and
in
to
more
than
miles
during
the
same
period
the
permanent
way
in

had
grown
from
miles
to

the
railways
and
speculations
in
land
made
for
mass
emigration
from
europe
to
the
united
states
and
more
than
million
people
immigrated
in
the
years
from
to
in
this
way
the
union
gradually
became
emancipated
from
european
and
in
particular
from
british
industry
factories
were
set
up
in
the
states
and
home
industries
developed
for
the
production
of
textiles
iron
steel
and
machinery
the
process
of
revolutionary
transformation
was
most
rapid
in
agriculture
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
had
compelled
the
southern
planters
to
introduce
the
steam
plough
shortly
after
the
civil
war
and
new
farms
had
sprung
up
in
the
west
in
the
wake
of
the
railways
which
from
the
very
beginning
employed
the
most
modern
machinery
and
technique
improvements
are
rapidly
revolutionising
the
agriculture
of
the
west
and
reducing
to
the
lowest
minimum
ever
attained

proportion
of
manual
labour
employed
in
its
operations
coincident
with
this
application
of
mechanics
to
agriculture
systematic
and
enlarged
business
aptitudes
have
also
sought
alliance
with
this
noble
art
farms
of
thousands
of
acres
have
been
managed
with
greater
skill
a
more
economical
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
and
with
a
larger
margin
of
real
profit
than
many
others
of
acres
during
this
time
direct
and
indirect
taxation
had
increased
enormously
on
june
during
the
civil
war
a
new
finance
bill
was
passed
which
is
the
basis
of
the
present
system
of
taxation
and
which
raised
taxes
on
consumption
and
income
to
a
staggering
degree
this
heavy
war
levy
served
as
a
pretext
for
a
real
orgy
of
protective
tariffs
in
order
to
offset
the
tax
on

production
by
customs
duties
morrill
stevens
and
the
other
gentlemen
who
advanced
the
war
as
a
lever
for
enforcing
their
protectionist
programme
initiated
the
practice
of
wielding
the
implement
of
a
customs
policy
quite
openly
and
cynically
to
further
private
profiteering
interests
of
all
descriptions
any
home
producer
who
appeared
before
the
legislative
assembly
with
a
request
for
any
kind
of
special
tariff
to
fill
his
own
pocket
saw
his
demands
readily
granted
and
the
tariff
rates
were
made
as
high
as

interested
party
might
wish

writes

in
many
ways

and
ennobling
influence
on
our
national
life
but
its
immediate
effect
on
business
affairs
and
on
all
legislation
affecting
moneyed
interests
was
demoralising
the
line
between
public
duty
and
private
interests
was
often
lost
sight
of
by
legislators
great
fortunes
were
made
by
changes
in
legislation
urged
and
brought
about
by
those
who
were
benefited
by
them
and
the
country
has
seen
with
sorrow
that
the
honour
and
honesty
of
public
men
did
not
remain
undefiled
this
customs
bill
which
completely
revolutionised
the
country
economic
life
and
remained
in
force
unchanged
for
twenty
years
was
literally
pushed
through
congress
in
three
days
and
through
the
senate
in
two
without
criticism
without
debate
without
any
opposition
whatever
down
to
the
present
day
it
forms
the
basis
of
customs
legislation
this
shift
in
fiscal
policy
ushered
in
an
era
of
the
most
brazen
parliamentary
and
of
undisguised
and
unrestrained
corruption
of
elections
of
the
legislature
and
the
press
to
satisfy
the
greed
of
big
business
became
the
catchword
of
public
life
after
the
war
to
liberate
mankind
from
the
of
slavery
on

the

his

by

industry
prospered
gone
were
the
times
when
the
small
or
medium
farmer
required
hardly
any
money
when
he
could
thresh
and
turn
into
cash
his
wheat
reserves
as
the
need
arose
now
he
was
chronically
in
need
of
money
a
lot
of
money
to
pay
his
taxes
soon
he
was
forced
to
sell
all
his
produce
and
to
buy
his
requirements
from
the
manufacturers
in
the
form
of
goods
as
peffer
puts
it
from
that
time
to
the
present
we
find
that
everything
nearly
has
been
changed
all
over
the
west
particularly
the
farmer
threshes
his
wheat
all
at
one
time
he
disposes
of
it
all
at
one
time
and
in
a
great
many
instances
the
straw
is
wasted
he
sells
his
hogs
and
buys
bacon
and
pork
he
sells
his
cattle
and
buys
fresh
beef
and
canned
beef
or
corned
beef
as
the
case
may
be
he
sells
his
fruit
and
buys
it
back
in
cans
if
he
raises
flax
at
all
instead
of
putting
it
into
yarn
and
making
gowns
for
his
children
as
he
did
fifty
years
or
more
ago
he
threshes
his
flax
sells
the
seed
and
burns
the
straw
not
more
than
one
farmer
in
fifty
now
keeps
sheep
at
all
he
relies
upon
the
large
sheep
farmer
for
the
wool
which
is
put
into
cloth
or
clothing
ready
for
his
use
instead
of
having
clothing
made
up
on
the
farm
in
his
own
house
or
by
a
neighbour
woman
or
country
tailor
a
mile
away
he
either
purchases
his
clothing
ready
made
at
the
nearest
town
or
he
buys
the
cloth
and
has
a
city
tailor
make
it
up
for
him
instead
of
making
implements
which
he
uses
about
the
farm
forks
rakes
he
goes
to
town
to
purchase
even
a
handle
for
his
axe
or
his
mallet
he
purchases
twine
and
rope
and
all
sorts
of
needed
material
made
of
fibres
he
buys
his
cloth
and
his
clothing
he
buys
his
canned
fruit
and
preserved
fruit
he
buys
hams
and
shoulders
and
mess
pork
and
mess
beef
indeed
he
buys
nearly
everything
now
that
he
produced
at
one
time
himself
and
these
things
all
cost
money
besides
all
this
and
what
seems
stranger
than
anything
else
whereas
in
the
earlier
time
the
american
home
was
a
free
home
unencumbered
not
one
case
in
a
thousand
where
a
home
was
mortgaged
to
secure
the
payment
of
borrowed
money
and
whereas
but
a
small
amount
of
money
was
then
needed
for
actual
use
in
conducting
the
business
of
farming
there
was
always
enough
of
it
among
the
farmers
to
supply
the
demand
now
when
at
least
ten
times
as
much
is
needed
there
is
little
or
none
to
be
obtained
nearly
half
the
farms
are
mortgaged
for
as
much
as
they
are
worth
and
interest
rates
are
exorbitant
as
to
the
cause
of
such
wonderful
changes
the
manufacturer
came
with
his
woollen
mill
his
carding
mill
his
broom
factory
his
rope
factory
his
factory
his
cotton
factory
his
establishment
his
canning
factory
and
fruit
preserving
houses
the
little
shop
on
the
farm
has
given
place
to
the
large
shop
in
town
the
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
has
given
way
to
the
large
establishment
in
the
city
where
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
wagons
are
made
in
a
week
the
shoemaker
shop
has
given
way
to
large
establishments
in
the
cities
where
most
of
the
work
is
done
by
machines
finally
the
agricultural
labour
of
the
farmer
himself
has
become
machine
work
ploughs
and
sows
and
reaps
with

a
machine

his
wheat
and

estimated
in
the
middle
eighties
that
the
necessary
cash
a
very
modest
beginning
of
the
smallest
farm
in
the
north
west
is
to
this
revolution
of
american
agriculture
after
the
war
was
not
the
end
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
whirlpool
in
which
the
farmer
was
caught
his
history
brings
us
automatically
to
the
second
phase
of
the
development
of
capitalist
accumulation
of
which
it
is
an
excellent
natural
economy
the
production
for
personal
needs
and
the
close
connection
between
industry
and
agriculture
must
be
ousted
and
a
simple
commodity
economy
substituted
for
them
capitalism
needs
the
medium
of
commodity
production
for
its
development
as
a
market
for
its
surplus
value
but
as
soon
as
simple
commodity
production
has
superseded
natural
economy
capital
must
turn
against
it
no
sooner
has
capital
called
it
to
life
than
the
two
must
compete
for
means
of
production
labour
power
and
markets
the
first
aim
of
capitalism
is
to
isolate
the
producer
to
sever
the
community
ties
which
protect
him
and
the
next
task
is
to
take
the
means
of
production
away
from
the
small
manufacturer
in
the
american
union
as
we
have
seen
the
war
inaugurated
an
era
of
seizure
of
public
lands
by
monopolist
capitalist
companies
and
individual
speculators
feverish
railroad
building
and
ever
more
speculation
in
railway
shares
led
to
a
mad
gamble
in
land
where
individual
soldiers
of
fortune
and
companies
netted
immense
fortunes
and
even
entire
counties
in
addition
a
veritable
swarm
of
agents
lured
the
vast
flow
of
emigrants
from
europe
to
the
by
blatant
and

who
farmed
them

on

capitalistic

all
around
the

had
been

into

a

we
may
consider
oliver

subdivided
into

since
the
time
of
lafargue
writing
extensive
capitalist
agriculture
in
america
has
made
great
strides
in
technique
and
the
employment
of
machinery
the
american
farmer
could
not
successfully
compete
with
such
capitalist
enterprises
at
a
time
when
the
general
revolution
in
the
conditions
of
finance
production
and
transport
compelled
him
to
give
up
production
for
personal
needs
and
to
produce
exclusively
for
the
market
the
great
spreading
of
agriculture
caused
a
heavy
fall
in
the
prices
of
agricultural
products
and
at
the
precise
moment
when
farming
became
dependent
on
the
market
the
agricultural
market
of
the
union
was
suddenly
turned
from
a
local
one
into
a
world
market
and
became
a
prey
to
the
wild
speculations
of
a
few
capitalist
mammoth
concerns
in
a
notable
year
for
the
history
of
agricultural
conditions
in
europe
as
well
as
in
america
there
began
the
mass
export
of
wheat
from
the
to
europe
big
business
was
of
course
the
only
one
to
profit
from
this
expanding
market
the
small
farmer
was
crushed
by
the
competition
of
an
increasing
number
of
extensive
farms
and
became
the
prey
of
speculators
who
bought
up
his
corn
to
exert
pressure
on
the
world
market
helpless
in
the
face
of
the
immense
capitalist
powers
the
farmer
got
into
debt
a
phenomenon
typical
for
a
declining
peasant
economy
in
secretary
rusk
of
the
department
of
agriculture
sent
out
a
circular
letter
with
reference
to
the
desperate
position
of
the
farmers
saying
burden
of
mortgages
upon
farms
homes
and
land
is
unquestionably
discouraging
in
the
extreme
and
while
in
some
cases
no
doubt
this
load
may
have
been
too
readily
assumed
still
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
mortgage
has
been
the
result
of
necessity
these
mortgages
drawing
high
rates
of
interest
have
in
the
face
of
continued
depression
of
the
prices
of
staple
products
become
very
irksome
and
in
many
cases
threaten
the
farmer
with
loss
of
home
and
land
it
is
a
question
of
grave
difficulty
to
all
those
who
seek
to
remedy
the
ills
from
which
our
farmers
are
suffering
at
present
prices
the
farmer
finds
that
it
takes
more
of
his
products
to
get
a
dollar
wherewith
to
buy
back
the
dollar
which
he
borrowed
than
it
did
when
he
borrowed
it
the
interest
accumulates
while
the
payment
of
the
principal
seems
utterly
hopeless
and
the
very
depression
which
we
are
discussing
makes
the
renewal
of
the
mortgage
most
difficult
according
to
the
census
of
may
million
farms
were
deep
in
debt
of
them
were
managed
by
the
owners
whose
obligations
amounted
to
nearly
situation
is
this
farmers
are
passing
through
the
valley
and
shadow
of
death
farming
as
a
business
is
profitless
values
of
farm
products
have
fallen
per
cent
since
the
great
war
and
farm
values
have
depreciated
to
per

during
the
last
ten
years
farmers
are
overwhelmed
with
debts
secured
by
mortgages
on
their
homes
unable
in
many
instances
to
pay
even
the
interest
as
it
falls
due
and
unable
to
renew
the
loans
because
securities
are
weakening
by
reason
of
the
general
depression
many
farmers
are
losing
their
homes
under
this
dreadful
blight
and
the
mortgage
mill
still
grinds
we
are
in
the
hands
of
a
merciless
power
the
people
homes
are
at
stake
encumbered
with
debts
and
close
to
ruin
the
farmer
had
no
option
but
to
supplement
his
earnings
by
working
for
a
wage
or
else
to
abandon
his
farm
altogether
provided
it
had
not
yet
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
his
creditors
like
so
many
thousands
of
farms
he
could
shake
from
off
his
feet
the
dust
of
the
of
promise
that
had
become
an
inferno
for
him
in
the
middle
eighties
abandoned
and
decaying
farms
could
be
seen
everywhere
in
sering
wrote
the
farmer
can
not
pay
his
debts
to
date
the
interest
he
has
to
pay
is
increased
to
or
even
per
cent
he
is
pressed
by
the
banker
the
machine
salesman
and
the
grocer
who
rob
him
of
the
fruits
of
his
hard
work
he
can
either
remain
on
the
farm
as
a
tenant
or
move
further
west
to
try
his
fortunes
elsewhere
nowhere
in
north
america
have
i
found
so
many
indebted
disappointed
and
depressed
farmers
as
in
the
wheat
regions
of
the
north
western
prairies
i
have
not
spoken
to
a
single
farmer
in
dakota
who
would
not
have
been
prepared
to
sell
his
farm
commissioner
of
agriculture
of
vermont
in
reported
a
desertion
of
of
that
state
he
wrote
there
appears
to
be
no
doubt
about
there
being
in
this
state
large
tracts
of
tillable
unoccupied
lands
which
can
be
bought
at
a
price
approximating
the
price
of
western
lands
situated
near
school
and
church
and
not
far
from
railroad
facilities
the
commissioner
has
not
visited
all
of
the
counties
in
the
state
where
these
lands
are
reported
but
he
has
visited
enough
to
satisfy
him
that
while
much
of
the
unoccupied
and
formerly
cultivated
land
is
now
practically
worthless
for
cultivation
yet
very
much
of
it
can
be
made
to
yield
a
liberal
reward
to
intelligent
labour
the
commissioner
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
issued
a
pamphlet
in
devoting
pages
to
the
description
of
farms
for
sale
at
the
lowest
figures
he
describes
farms
with
tenantable
buildings
abandoned
only
recently
the
same
has
happened
in
other
districts
thousands
of
acres
once
raising
corn
and
wheat
are
left
untilled
and
run
to
brush
and
wood
in
order
to
resettle
the
deserted
land
speculators
engaged
in
advertising
campaigns
and
attracted
crowds
of
new
immigrants
new
victims
who
were
to
suffer
their
predecessors
fate
even
more
speedily
a
private
letter
says
the
neighbourhood
of
railroads
and
markets
there
remains
no
common
land
it
is
all
in
the
hands
of
the
speculators
a
settler
takes
over
vacant
land
and
counts
for
a
farmer
but
the
management
of
his
farm
hardly
assures
his
livelihood
and
he
can
not
possibly
compete
with
the
big
farmer
he
tills
as
much
of
his
land
as
the
law
compels
him
to
do
but
to
make
a
comfortable
living
he
must
look
for
additional
sources
of
income
outside
agriculture
in
oregon
for
instance
i
have
met
a
settler
who
owned
acres
for
five
years
but
every
summer
until
the
end
of
july
he
worked
twelve
hours
a
day
for
a
dollar
a
day
at
this
man
of
course
also
counts
as
one
of
the
five
million
farmers
in
the
census
again
in
the
county
of
eldorado
i
saw
many
farmers
who
cultivated
their
land
only
to
feed
their
cattle
and
themselves
there
would
have
been
no
profit
in
producing
for
the
market
and
their
chief
income
derives
from
the
felling
and
selling
of
timber
etc
these
people
are
prosperous
but
it
is
not
agriculture
which
makes
them
so
two
years
ago
we
worked
in
long
cañon
eldorado
county
living
in
a
cabin
on
an
allotment
the
owner
of
this
allotment
came
home
only
once
a
year
for
a
couple
of
days
and
worked
the
rest
of
the
time
on
the
railway
in
sacramento
some
years
ago
a
small
part
of
the
allotment
was
cultivated
to
comply
with
the
law
but
now
it
is
left
completely
untilled
a
few
acres
are
fenced
off
with
wire
and
there
is
a
log
cabin
and
a
shed
but
during
the
last
years
all
this
stands
empty
a
neighbour
has
the
key
and
he
made
us
free
of
the
hut
in
the
course
of
our
journey
we
saw
many
deserted
allotments
where
attempts
at
farming
had
been
made
three
years
ago
i
was
offered
a
farm
with
dwelling
house
for
a
hundred
dollars
but
in
a
short
time
the
unoccupied
house
collapsed
under
the
snow
in
oregon
we
saw
many
derelict
farms
with
small
dwelling
houses
and
vegetable
gardens
one
we
visited
was
beautifully
made
a
sturdy
block
house
fashioned
by
a
and
some
equipment
but
the
farmer
had
abandoned
it
all
you
were
welcome
to
take
it
all
without
charge
where
could
the
ruined
american
farmer
turn
he
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
to
follow
the
wheat
centre
and
the
railways
the
former
had
shifted
in
the
main
to
canada
the
saskatchewan
and
the
mackenzie
river
where
wheat
can
still
thrive
on
the
parallel
a
number
of
american
farmers
followed
and
after
some
time
in
canada
they
suffered
the
old
fate
during
recent
years
canada
has
entered
the
world
market
as
a
country
but
her
agriculture
is
dominated
to
an
even
greater
extent
by
big
capital
than
elsewhere
in
canada
public
lands
were
lavished
upon
private
capitalist
companies
on
an
even
more
monstrous
scale
than
in
the
united
states
under
the
charter
of
the
canadian
pacific
railway
company
with
its
grant
of
land
private
capital
perpetrated
an
unprecedented
act
of
robbing
the
public
not
only
that
the
company
was
guaranteed
a
twenty
years
monopoly
of
not
only
that
it
got
a
building
site
of
about
miles
free
of
charge
not
only
that
it
got
a
years
state
guarantee
of
the
per
cent
interest
on
the
share
capital
of
to
crown
it
all
the
company
was
given
the
choice
of
million
acres
out
of
the
most
fertile
and
favourably
situated
lands
not
necessarily
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
permanent
way
as
a
free
gift
all
future
settlers
on
this
vast
area
were
thus
at
the
mercy
of
railway
capital
from
the
very
outset
the
railway
company
in
its
turn
immediately
proceeded
to
sell
off
million
acres
for
ready
cash
to
the
land
company
an
association
of
british
capitalists
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
duke
of
manchester
the
second
group
of
capitalists
which
was
liberally
endowed
with
public
lands
was
the
hudson
bay
company
which
was
given
a
title
to
no
less
than
of
all
the
lands
between
lake
winnipeg
the
border
the
rocky
mountains
and
northern
saskatchewan
for
renouncing
their
privileges
in
the
between
them
these
two
capitalist
groups
had
gained
possession
of
of
all
the
land
that
could
be
settled
a
considerable
part
of
the
other
lands
was
assigned
by
the
state
to
capitalist
companies
thus
the
canadian
farmer
was
practically
everywhere
ensnared
by
capital
and
capitalist
speculation
and
still
mass
immigration
continued
not
only
from
europe
but
also
from
the
united
states
these
are
the
characteristics
of
capitalist
domination
on
an
international
scale
having
evicted
the
peasant
from
his
soil
it
drives
him
from
england
to
the
east
of
the
united
states
and
from
there
to
the
west
and
on
the
ruins
of
the
red
indians
economy
it
transforms
him
back
into
a
small
commodity
producer
then
when
he
is
ruined
once
more
he
is
driven
from
the
west
to
the
north
with
the
railways
in
the
van
and
ruin
in
the
rear
capital
leads
the
way
its
passage
is
marked
with
universal
destruction
the
great
fall
of
prices
in
the
nineties
is
again
succeeded
by
higher
prices
for
agricultural
products
but
this
is
of
no
more
avail
to
the
small
american
farmer
than
to
the
european
peasant
yet
the
numbers
of
farmers
are
constantly
swelling
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
had
grown
from
to
and
the
following
ten
years
still
saw
an
absolute
increase
the
aggregate
value
of
farms
had
during
the
same
period
risen
from
to
we
might
have
expected
the
general
increase
in
the
price
of
farm
produce
to
have
helped
the
farmer
to
come
into
his
own
but
that
is
not
so
we
see
that
the
growing
numbers
of
tenant
farmers
outstrip
the
increase
in
the
farming
population
as
a
whole
in
the
proportion
of
tenant
farmers
amounted
to
per
cent
of
the
total
number
of
farmers
in
the
union
in
it
was
per
cent
in
per
cent
and
in
per
cent
though
prices
for
farm
produce
were
rising
the
tenant
farmer
was
more
and
more
rapidly
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
the
independent
farmer
and
although
much
more
than
of
all
farmers
in
the
union
are
now
tenant
farmers
their
social
status
in
the
united
states
is
that
of
the
agricultural
labourer
in
europe
constantly
fluctuating
they
are
indeed
of
capital
they
work
very
hard
to
create
wealth
for
capital
getting
nothing
in
return
but
a
miserable
and
precarious
existence
in
quite
a
different
historical
setting
in
south
africa
the
same
process
shows
up
even
more
clearly
the
methods
by
which
capital
competes
with
the
small
commodity
producer
in
the
cape
colony
and
the
boer
republics
pure
peasant
economy
prevailed
until
the
sixties
of
the
last
century
for
a
long
time
the
boers
had
led
the
life
of
nomads
they
had
killed
off
or
driven
out
the
hottentots
and
kaffirs
with
a
will
in
order
to
deprive
them
of
their
most
valuable
pastures
in
the
eighteenth
century
they
were
given
invaluable
assistance
by
the
plague
imported
by
ships
of
the
east
india
company
which
frequently
did
away
with
entire
hottentot
tribes
whose
lands
then
fell
to
the
dutch
immigrants
when
the
boers
spread
further
east
they
came
in
conflict
with
the
bantu
tribes
and
initiated
the
long
period
of
the
terrible
kaffir
wars
these
dutchmen
regarded
themselves
as
the
chosen
people
and
took
no
small
pride
in
their
puritan
morals
and
their
intimate
knowledge
of
the
old
testament
yet
not
content
with
robbing
the
natives
of
their
land
they
built
their
peasant
economy
like
parasites
on
the
backs
of
the
negroes
compelling
them
to
do
for
them
and
corrupting
and
enervating
them
deliberately
and
systematically
liquor
played
such
an
important
part
in
this
process
that
the
prohibition
of
spirits
in
the
cape
colony
could
not
be
carried
through
by
the
english
government
because
of
puritan
opposition
there
were
no
railways
until
and
boer
economy
in
general
and
on
the
whole
remained
patriarchal
and
based
on
natural
economy
until
the
sixties
but
their
patriarchal
attitude
did
not
deter
the
boers
from
extreme
brutality
and
harshness
it
is
well
known
that
livingstone
complained
much
more
about
the
boers
than
about
the
kaffirs
the
boers
considered
the
negroes
an
object
destined
by
god
and
nature
to
slave
for
them
and
as
such
an
indispensable
foundation
of
their
peasant
economy
so
much
so
that
their
answer
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
english
colonies
in
was
the
trek
although
there
the
owners
had
been
compensated
with
by
way
of
the
orange
river
and
vaal
the
boers
emigrated
from
the
cape
colony
and
in
the
process
they
drove
the
matabele
to
the
north
across
the
limpopo
setting
them
against
the
makalakas
just
as
the
american
farmer
had
driven
the
red
indian
west
before
him
under
the
impact
of
capitalist
economy
so
the
boer
drove
the
negro
to
the
north
the
republics
between
the
orange
river
and
the
limpopo
thus
were
created
as
a
protest
against
the
designs
of
the
english
bourgeoisie
on
the
sacred
right
of
slavery
the
tiny
peasant
republics
were
in
constant
guerilla
warfare
against
the
bantu
negroes
and
it
was
on
the
backs
of
the
negroes
that
the
battle
between
the
boers
and
the
english
government
which
went
on
for
decades
was
fought
the
negro
question
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
ostensibly
aimed
at
by
the
english
bourgeoisie
served
as
a
pretext
for
the
conflict
between
england
and
the
republics
in
fact
peasant
economy
and
great
capitalist
colonial
policy
were
here
competing
for
the
hottentots
and
kaffirs
that
is
to
say
for
their
land
and
their
labour
power
both
competitors
had
precisely
the
same
aim
to
subject
expel
or
destroy
the
coloured
peoples
to
appropriate
their
land
and
press
them
into
service
by
the
abolition
of
their
social
organisations
only
their
methods
of
exploitation
were
fundamentally
different
while
the
boers
stood
for
slavery
on
a
petty
scale
on
which
their
patriarchal
peasant
economy
was
founded
the
british
bourgeoisie
represented
modern
capitalist
exploitation
of
the
land
and
the
natives
the
constitution
of
the
transvaal
south
african
republic
declared
with
crude
prejudice
people
shall
not
permit
any
equality
of
coloured
persons
with
white
inhabitants
neither
in
the
church
nor
in
the
state
in
the
orange
free
state
and
in
the
transvaal
no
negro
was
allowed
to
own
land
to
travel
without
papers
or
to
walk
abroad
after
sunset
bryce
tells
us
of
a
case
where
a
farmer
an
englishman
as
it
happened
in
the
eastern
cape
colony
had
flogged
his
kaffir
slave
to
death
when
he
was
acquitted
in
open
court
his
neighbours
escorted
him
home
to
the
strains
of
music
the
white
man
frequently
maltreated
his
free
native
labourers
after
they
had
done
their
work
to
such
an
extent
that
they
would
take
to
flight
thus
saving
the
master
their
wages
the
british
government
employed
precisely
the
opposite
tactics
for
a
long
time
it
appeared
as
protector
of
the
natives
flattering
the
chieftains
in
particular
it
supported
their
authority
and
tried
to
make
them
claim
a
right
of
disposal
over
their
land
wherever
it
was
possible
it
gave
them
ownership
of
tribal
land
according
to
methods
although
this
flew
in
the
face
of
tradition
and
of
the
actual
social
organisation
of
the
negroes
all
tribes
in
fact
held
their
land
communally
and
even
the
most
cruel
and
despotic
rulers
such
as
the
matabele
chieftain
lobengula
merely
had
the
right
as
well
as
the
duty
to
allot
every
family
a
piece
of
land
which
they
could
only
retain
so
long
as
they
cultivated
it
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
british
government
was
clear
long
in
advance
it
was
preparing
for
land
robbery
on
a
grand
scale
using
the
native
chieftains
themselves
as
tools
but
in
the
beginning
it
was
content
with
the
of
the
negroes
by
extensive
military
actions
up
to
were
fought
bloody
kaffir
wars
to
break
the
resistance
of
the
bantus
british
capital
revealed
its
real
intentions
only
after
two
important
events
had
taken
place
the
discovery
of
the
kimberley
diamond
fields
in
and
the
discovery
of
the
gold
mines
in
the
transvaal
in
which
initiated
a
new
epoch
in
the
history
of
south
africa
then
the
british
south
africa
company
that
is
to
say
cecil
rhodes
went
into
action
public
opinion
in
england
rapidly
swung
over
and
the
greed
for
the
treasures
of
south
africa
urged
the
british
government
on
to
drastic
measures
south
africa
was
suddenly
flooded
with
immigrants
who
had
hitherto
only
appeared
in
small
numbers
immigration
having
been
deflected
to
the
united
states
but
with
the
discovery
of
the
diamond
and
gold
fields
the
numbers
of
white
people
in
the
south
african
colonies
grew
by
leaps
and
bounds
between
and
british
had
immigrated
into
witwatersrand
alone
the
modest
peasant
economy
was
forthwith
pushed
into
the
background
the
mines
and
thus
the
mining
capital
coming
to
the
fore
the
policy
of
the
british
government
veered
round
abruptly
great
britain
had
recognised
the
boer
republics
by
the
sand
river
agreement
and
the
treaty
of
bloemfontein
in
the
fifties
now
her
political
might
advanced
upon
the
tiny
republics
from
every
side
occupying
all
neighbouring
districts
and
cutting
off
all
possibility
of
expansion
at
the
same
time
the
negroes
no
longer
protected
favourites
were
sacrificed
british
capital
was
steadily
forging
ahead
in
britain
took
over
the
rule
of
basutoland
only
of
course
because
the
natives
had
implored
her
to
do
so
in
the
witwatersrand
diamond
fields
or
west
griqualand
were
seized
from
the
orange
free
state
and
turned
into
a
crown
colony
in
zululand
was
subjected
later
to
become
part
of
the
natal
colony
in
followed
the
subjection
of
bechuanaland
to
be
joined
to
the
cape
colony
in
britain
took
over
matabele
and
mashonaland
and
in
the
british
south
africa
company
was
given
a
charter
for
both
these
districts
again
of
course
only
to
oblige
the
natives
and
at
their
request
between
and
britain
annexed
lucia
bay
and
the
entire
east
coast
as
far
as
the
portuguese
possessions
in
she
subjected
tongaland
with
their
last
strength
the
matabele
and
mashona
fought
one
more
desperate
battle
but
the
company
with
rhodes
at
the
head
first
liquidated
the
rising
in
blood
and
at
once
proceeded
to
the
measure
for
civilising
and
pacifying
the
natives
two
large
railways
were
built
in
the
rebellious
district
the
boer
republics
were
feeling
increasingly
uncomfortable
in
this
sudden
stranglehold
and
their
internal
affairs
as
well
were
becoming
completely
disorganised
the
overwhelming
influx
of
immigrants
and
the
rising
tides
of
the
frenzied
new
capitalist
economy
now
threatened
to
burst
the
barriers
of
the
small
peasant
states
there
was
indeed
a
blatant
conflict
between
agricultural
and
political
peasant
economy
on
the
one
hand
and
the
demands
and
requirements
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
on
the
other
in
all
respects
the
republics
were
quite
unable
to
cope
with
these
new
problems
the
constant
danger
from
the
kaffirs
no
doubt
regarded
favourably
by
the
british
the
unwieldy
primitive
administration
the
gradual
corruption
of
the
in
which
the
great
capitalists
got
their
way
by
bribery
lack
of
a
police
force
to
keep
the
undisciplined
crowds
of
adventurers
in
some
semblance
of
order
the
absence
of
labour
legislation
for
regulating
and
securing
the
exploitation
of
the
negroes
in
the
mines
lack
of
water
supplies
and
transport
to
provide
for
the
colony
of
immigrants
that
had
suddenly
sprung
up
high
protective
tariffs
which
increased
the
cost
of
labour
for
the
capitalists
and
high
freights
for
coal
all
these
factors
combined
towards
the
sudden
and
stunning
bankruptcy
of
the
peasant
republics
they
tried
obstinately
and
unimaginatively
to
defend
themselves
against
the
sudden
eruption
of
capitalism
which
engulfed
them
with
an
incredibly
crude
measure
such
as
only
a
stubborn
and
peasant
brain
could
have
devised
they
denied
all
civic
rights
to
the
who
outnumbered
them
by
far
and
who
stood
for
capital
power
and
the
trend
of
the
time
in
those
critical
times
it
was
an
trick
the
mismanagement
of
the
peasant
republics
caused
a
considerable
reduction
of
dividends
on
no
account
to
be
put
up
with
mining
capital
had
come
to
the
end
of
its
tether
the
british
south

company
built
railroads
put
down
the
kaffirs
organised
revolts
of
the
and
finally
provoked
the
boer
war
the
bell
had
tolled
for
peasant
economy
in
the
united
states
the
economic
revolution
had
begun
with
a
war
in
south
africa
war
put
the
period
to
this
chapter
yet
in
both
instances
the
outcome
was
the
same
capital
triumphed
over
the
small
peasant
economy
which
had
in
its
turn
come
into
being
on
the
ruins
of
natural
economy
represented
by
the
primitive
organisations
the
domination
of
capital
was
a
foregone
conclusion
and
it
was
just
as
hopeless
for
the
boer
republics
to
resist
as
it
had
been
for
the
american
farmer
capital
officially
took
over
the
reins
in
the
new
south
african
union
which
replaced
the
small
peasant
republics
by
a
great
modern
state
as
envisaged
by
cecil
imperialist
programme
the
new
conflict
between
capital
and
labour
had
superseded
the
old
one
between
british
and
dutch
one
million
white
exploiters
of
both
nations
sealed
their
touching
fraternal
alliance
within
the
union
with
the
civil
and
political
disfranchisement
of
five
million
coloured
workers
not
only
the
negroes
of
the
boer
republics
came
away
but
the
natives
of
the
cape
colony
whom
the
british
government
had
at
one
time
granted
political
equality
were
also
deprived
of
some
of
their
rights
and
this
noble
work
culminating
under
the
imperialist
policy
of
the
conservatives
in
open
oppression
was
actually
to
be
finished
by
the
liberal
party
itself
amid
frenzied
applause
from
the
cretins
of
europe
who
with
sentimental
pride
took
as
proof
of
the
still
continuing
creative
vigour
and
greatness
of
english
liberalism
the
fact
that
britain
had
granted
complete
and
freedom
to
a
handful
of
whites
in
south
africa
the
ruin
of
independent
craftsmanship
by
capitalist
competition
no
less
painful
for
being
deserves
by
rights
a
chapter
to
itself
the
most
sinister
part
of
such
a
chapter
would
be
under
capitalism
but
we
need
not
dwell
on
these
phenomena
here
the
general
result
of
the
struggle
between
capitalism
and
simple
commodity
production
is
this
after
substituting
commodity
economy
for
natural
economy
capital
takes
the
place
of
simple
commodity
economy
organisations
provide
a
fertile
soil
for
capitalism
more
strictly
capital
feeds
on
the
ruins
of
such
organisations
and
although
this
is
indispensable
for
accumulation
the
latter
proceeds
at
the
cost
of
this
medium
nevertheless
by
eating
it
up
historically
the
accumulation
of
capital
is
a
kind
of
metabolism
between
capitalist
economy
and
those
methods
of
production
without
which
it
can
not
go
on
and
which
in
this
light
it
corrodes
and
assimilates
thus
capital
can
not
accumulate
without
the
aid
of
organisations
nor
on
the
other
hand
can
it
tolerate
their
continued
existence
side
by
side
with
itself
only
the
continuous
and
progressive
disintegration
of
organisations
makes
accumulation
of
capital
possible
the
premises
which
are
postulated
in
marx
diagram
of
accumulation
accordingly
represent
no
more
than
the
historical
tendency
of
the
movement
of
accumulation
and
its
logical
conclusion
the
accumulative
process
endeavours
everywhere
to
substitute
simple
commodity
economy
for
natural
economy
its
ultimate
aim
that
is
to
say
is
to
establish
the
exclusive
and
universal
domination
of
capitalist
production
in
all
countries
and
for
all
branches
of
industry
yet
this
argument
does
not
lead
anywhere
as
soon
as
this
final
result
is
achieved
in
theory
of
course
because
it
can
never
actually
happen
accumulation
must
come
to
a
stop
the
realisation
and
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
become
impossible
to
accomplish
just
as
soon
as
reality
begins
to
correspond
to
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
the
end
of
accumulation
is
in
sight
it
has
reached
its
limits
and
capitalist
production
is
for
capital
the
standstill
of
accumulation
means
that
the
development
of
the
productive
forces
is
arrested
and
the
collapse
of
capitalism
follows
inevitably
as
an
objective
historical
necessity
this
is
the
reason
for
the
contradictory
behaviour
of
capitalism
in
the
final
stage
of
its
historical
career
imperialism
marx
diagram
of
enlarged
reproduction
thus
does
not
conform
to
the
conditions
of
an
accumulation
in
actual
progress
progressive
accumulation
can
not
be
reduced
to
static
interrelations
and
interdependence
between
the
two
great
departments
of
social
production
the
departments
of
producer
and
consumer
goods
as
the
diagram
would
have
it
accumulation
is
more
than
an
internal
relationship
between
the
branches
of
capitalist
economy
it
is
primarily
a
relationship
between
capital
and
a
environment
where
the
two
great
departments
of
production
sometimes
perform
the
accumulative
process
on
their
own
independently
of
each
other
but
even
then
at
every
step
the
movements
overlap
and
intersect
from
this
we
get
most
complicated
relations
divergencies
in
the
speed
and
direction
of
accumulation
for
the
two
departments
different
relations
with
modes
of
production
as
regards
both
material
elements
and
elements
of
value
which
we
can
not
possibly
lay
down
in
rigid
formulæ
marx
diagram
of
accumulation
is
only
the
theoretical
reflection
of
the
precise
moment
when
the
domination
of
capital
has
reached
its
limits
and
thus
it
is
no
less
a
fiction
than
his
diagram
of
simple
reproduction
which
gives
the
theoretical
formulation
for
the
point
of
departure
of
capitalist
accumulation
the
precise
definition
of
capitalist
accumulation
and
its
laws
lies
somewhere
in
between
these
two
fictions
footnotes
until
recently
in
china
the
domestic
industries
were
widely
practised
even
by
the
bourgeoisie
and
in
such
large
and
ancient
towns
as
ningpo
with
its
inhabitants
a
generation
ago
the
family
shoes
hats
shirts
were
made
by
the
women
themselves
at
that
time
it
was
practically
for
a
young
woman
to
buy
from
a
merchant
what
she
could
have
made
with
the
labour
of
her
own
hands
tsur
of
industry
in
the
town
of
gewerblichen
betriebsformen
der
stadt
tuebingen
admittedly
this
relation
is
reversed
in
the
last
stages
of
the
history
of
peasant
economy
when
capitalist
production
has
made
its
full
impact
once
the
small
peasants
are
ruined
the
entire
work
of
farming
frequently
devolves
on
the
women
old
people
and
children
while
the
men
are
made
to
work
for
their
living
for
capitalist
entrepreneurs
in
the
domestic
industries
or
as
in
the
factories

the

they

while
on
the

they
already
embody
new
conflicts
which
run
counter
to
the
domination
of

these
factors
account
for
their
immense
drive
but
at
the
same
time
impede
and
delay
the
ultimate
victory
of
the
revolutionary
forces
a

usually
sever

as
well
as
the

of

has
various
functions
it
serves
to
convert
the
money
of
groups
into
capital
money
both
as
a
commodity
equivalent
lower
savings
and
as
fund
of

for
the
of
the
capitalist
class
it
serves
to
transform
money
capital
into
productive
capital
by
means
of
state
enterprise
railroad
building
and
military
supplies
it
serves
to
divert
accumulated
capital
from
the
old
capitalist
countries
to
young
ones
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
the

at

time
from

to
turkey
from
england
germany
and
france
to
china
and
via
russia
to
persia
in
the
imperialist
era
the
foreign
loan
played
an
outstanding
part
as
a
means
for
young
capitalist
states
to
acquire
independence
the
contradictions
inherent
in
the
modern
system
of
foreign
loans
are
the
concrete
expression
of
those
which
characterise
the
imperialist
phase
though
foreign
loans
are
indispensable
for
the
emancipation
of
the
rising
capitalist
states
they
are
yet
the
surest
ties
by
which
the
old
capitalist
states
maintain
their
influence
exercise
financial
control
and
exert
pressure
on
the
customs
foreign
and
commercial
policy
of
the
young
capitalist
states
channels
for
the
investment
in
new
spheres
of
capital
accumulated
in
the
old
countries
such
loans
widen
the
scope
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
but
at
the
same
time
they
restrict
it
by
creating
new
competition
for
the
investing
countries
these
inherent
conflicts
of
the
international
loan
system
are
a
classic
example
of
divergencies
between
the
conditions
for
the
realisation
of
surplus
value
and
the
capitalisation
thereof
while
realisation
of
the
surplus
value
requires
only
the
general
spreading
of
commodity
production
its
capitalisation
demands
the
progressive
supercession
of
simple
commodity
production
by
capitalist
economy
with
the
corollary
that
the
limits
to
both
the
realisation
and
the
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
keep
contracting
ever
more
employment
of
international
capital
in
the
construction
of
the
international
railway
network
reflects
this
disparity
between
the
thirties
and
the
sixties
of
the
nineteenth
century
railway
building
and
the
loans
necessary
for
it
mainly
served
to
oust
natural
economy
and
to
spread
commodity
economy
as
in
the
case
of
the
russian
railway
loans
in
the
sixties
or
in
that
of
the
american
railways
which
were
built
with
european
capital
railway
construction
in
africa
and
asia
during
the
last
twenty
years
on
the
other
hand
almost
exclusively
served
the
purposes
of
an
imperialist
policy
of
economic
monopolisation
and
economic
subjugation
of
the
backward
communities
as
regards
railroad
construction
in
eastern
asia
for
instance
it
is
common
knowledge
that
russia
had
paved
the
way
for
the
military
occupation
of
manchuria
by
sending
troops
to
protect
her
engineers
working
on
the
manchurian
railway
with
the
same
object
in
view
russia
obtained
railway
concessions
in
persia
germany
in
asia
minor
and
mesopotamia
and
britain
and
germany
in
africa
in
this
connection
we
must
deal
with
a
misunderstanding
concerning
the
capital
investments
in
foreign
countries
and
the
demand
of
these
countries
for
capital
imports
already
in
the
early
twenties
of
the
last
century
the
export
of
british
capital
to
america
played
an
important
part
being
largely
responsible
for
the
first
genuine
industrial
and
commercial
crises
in
england
in
since
the
london
stock
exchange
had
been
flooded
with
south
american
stocks
and
shares
during
the
following
year
the
newly
created
states
of
south
and
central
america
raised
loans
in
london
alone
for
more
than
and
in
addition
enormous
quantities
of
south
american
industrial
shares
and
similar
bonds
were
sold
this
sudden
prosperity
and
the
opening
up
of
the
south
american
markets
in
their
turn
called
forth
greatly
increased
exports
of
british
commodities
to
the
latin
americas
british
commodity
exports
to
these
countries
amounted
to
in
which
had
risen
to
by
cotton
textiles
formed
the
most
important
item
of
these
exports
this
powerful
demand
was
the
impetus
for
a
rapid
expansion
of
british
cotton
production
and
many
new
factories
were
opened
in
raw
cotton
to
the
value
of
was
made
up
in
england
and
in
the
amount
had
risen
to
the
situation
was
thus
fraught
with
the
elements
of
a
crisis
tugan
baranovski
raises
the
question
from
where
did
the
south
american
countries
take
the
means
to
buy
twice
as
many
commodities
in
as
in
the
british
themselves
supplied
these
means
the
loans
floated
on
the
london
stock
exchange
served
as
payment
for
imported
goods
deceived
by
the
demand
they
had
themselves
created
the
british
were
soon
brought
to
realise
by
their
own
experience
that
their
high
expectations
had
been
unfounded
he
thus
characterises
as
as
an
unhealthy
abnormal
economic
phenomenon
the
fact
that
the
south
american
demand
for
english
goods
had
been
brought
about
by
british
capital
thus
uncritically
he
took
over
the
doctrine
of
an
expert
with
whose
other
theories
he
wished
to
have
nothing
in
common
the
opinion
had
been
advanced
already
during
the
english
crisis
of
that
it
could
be
explained
by
the
development
of
the
relations
between
british
capital
and
south
american
demand
none
other
than
sismondi
had
raised
the
same
question
as
tugan
baranovski
and
given
a
most
accurate
description
of
events
in
the
second
edition
of
his
opening
up
of
the
immense
market
afforded
by
spanish
america
to
industrial
producers
seemed
to
offer
a
good
opportunity
to
relieve
british
manufacture
the
british
government
were
of
that
opinion
and
in
the
seven
years
following
the
crisis
of
displayed
activity
to
carry
english
commerce
to
penetrate
the
remotest
districts
of
mexico
columbia
brazil
rio
de
la
plata
chile
and
peru
before
the
government
decided
to
recognise
these
new
states
it
had
to
protect
english
commerce
by
frequent
calls
of
battleships
whose
captains
had
a
diplomatic
rather
than
a
military
mission
in
consequence
it
had
defied
the
clamours
of
the
holy
alliance
and
recognised
the
new
republics
at
a
moment
when
the
whole
of
europe
on
the
contrary
was
plotting
their
ruin
but
however
big
the
demand
afforded
by
free
america
yet
it
would
not
have
been
enough
to
absorb
all
the
goods
england
had
produced
over
and
above
the
needs
of
consumption
had
not
their
means
for
buying
english
merchandise
been
suddenly
increased
beyond
all
bounds
by
the
loans
to
the
new
republics
every
american
state
borrowed
from
england
an
amount
sufficient
to
consolidate
its
government
although
they
were
capital
loans
they
were
immediately
spent
in
the
course
of
the
year
like
income
that
is
to
say
they
were
used
up
entirely
to
buy
english
goods
on
behalf
of
the
treasury
or
to
pay
for
those
which
had
been
dispatched
on
private
orders
at
the
same
time
numerous
companies
with
immense
capitals
were
formed
to
exploit
all
the
american
mines
but
all
the
money
they
spent
found
its
way
back
to
england
either
to
pay
for
the
machinery
which
they
immediately
used
or
else
for
the
goods
sent
to
the
localities
where
they
were
to
work
as
long
as
this
singular
commerce
lasted
in
which
the
english
only
asked
the
americans
to
be
kind
enough
to
buy
english
merchandise
with
english
capital
and
to
consume
them
for
their
sake
the
prosperity
of
english
manufacture
appeared
dazzling
it
was
no
more
income
but
rather
english
capital
which
was
used
to
push
on
consumption
the
english
themselves
bought
and
paid
for
their
own
goods
which
they
sent
to
america
and
thereby
merely
forwent
the
pleasure
of
using
these
goods
from
this
sismondi
drew
the
characteristic
conclusion
that
the
real
limits
to
the
capitalist
market
are
set
by
income
by
personal
consumption
alone
and
he
used
this
example
as
one
more
warning
against
accumulation
down
to
the
present
day
the
events
which
preceded
the
crisis
of
have
remained
typical
for
a
period
of
boom
and
expansion
of
capital
and
such
commerce
is
in
fact
one
of
the
most
important
foundations
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
particularly
in
the
history
of
british
capital
it
occurs
regularly
before
every
crisis
as
tugan
baranovski
himself
showed
by
the
following
facts
and
figures
the
immediate
cause
of
the
crisis
was
the
flooding
of
the
american
market
with
british
goods
again
financed
by
british
money
in
commodity
imports
exceeded
exports
by
but
at
the
same
time
their
imports
of
precious
metal
exceeded
exports
by
nearly
even
in
the
year
of
the
crisis
itself
their
surplus
of
imported
commodities
amounted
to
and
still
the
excess
of
bullion
imported
was
this
influx
of
money
no
less
than
the
stream
of
goods
came
chiefly
from
england
where
railway
shares
were
bought
in
bulk
saw
the
opening
in
the
united
states
of
new
banks
with
a
capital
of
predominantly
british
again
the
english
paid
for
their
exports
themselves
the
unprecedented
industrial
boom
in
the
northern
states
of
the
union
eventually
leading
to
the
civil
war
was
likewise
financed
by
british
capital
which
again
created
an
expanding
market
for
british
industry
in
the
united
states
and
not
only
british
capital
other
european
capitals
also
made
every
possible
effort
to
take
part
in
this
commerce
to
quote
schaeffle
in
the
five
years
between
and
at
least
were
invested
in
american
shares
on
the
various
stock
exchanges
of
europe
the
simultaneous
revival
of
world
industry
attained
such
dimensions
that
it
culminated
in
the
world
crash
of
in
the
sixties
british
capital
lost
no
time
in
creating
similar
conditions
in
asia
as
well
as
the
united
states
an
unending
stream
was
diverted
to
asia
minor
and
east
india
where
it
financed
the
most
magnificent
railroad
projects
the
permanent
way
of
british
india
amounted
in
to
miles
in
to
miles
in
to
miles
and
in
to
miles
this
at
once
increased
the
demand
for
british
commodities
no
sooner
had
the
war
of
secession
come
to
a
close
than
british
capital
again
flowed
into
the
united
states
it
again
paid
for
the

sheer

only

however
european
capital
had
acquired
such
a
taste
for

the

made
a

as

largely
participated
with
british

in
foreign
investments
while

had
been
financed

by
british
capital
from
the
fifties
to

late

german
capital
took
over
and
put
into
execution

tremendous
project
of

a

to
pay
for
german
goods
the
germans
forgoing
to
use
sismondi
term
only
the
pleasure
of
using
their
own
products
let
us
examine
the
position
more
closely
realised
surplus
value
which
can
not
be
capitalised
and
lies
idle
in
england
or
germany
is
invested
in
railway
construction
water
works
etc
in
the
argentine
australia
the
cape
colony
or
mesopotamia
machinery
materials
and
the
like
are
supplied
by
the
country
where
the
capital
has
originated
and
the
same
capital
pays
for
them
actually
this
process
characterises
capitalist
conditions
everywhere
even
at
home
capital
must
purchase
the
elements
of
production
and
thus
become
productive
capital
before
it
can
operate
admittedly
the
products
are
then
used
within
the
country
while
in
the
former
case
they
are
used
by
foreigners
but
then
capitalist
production
does
not
aim
at
its
products
being
enjoyed
but
at
the
accumulation
of
surplus
value
there
had
been
no
demand
for
the
surplus
product
within
the
country
so
capital
had
lain
idle
without
the
possibility
of
accumulating
but
abroad
where
capitalist
production
has
not
yet
developed
there
has
come
about
voluntarily
or
by
force
a
new
demand
of
the
strata
the
consumption
of
the
capitalist
and
working
classes
at
home
is
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
accumulation
and
what
matters
to
capital
is
the
very
fact
that
its
products
are
by
the
new
consumers
must
indeed
realise
the
products
pay
for
their
use
and
for
this
they
need
money
they
can
obtain
some
of
it
by
the
exchange
of
commodities
which
begins
at
this
point
a
brisk
traffic
in
goods
following
hard
on
the
heels
of
railway
construction
and
mining
gold
mines
thus
the
capital
advanced
for
railroad
building
and
mining
together
with
an
additional
surplus
value
is
gradually
realised
it
is
immaterial
to
the
situation
as
a
whole
whether
this
exported
capital
becomes
share
capital
in
new
independent
enterprises
or
whether
as
a
government
loan
it
uses
the
mediation
of
a
foreign
state
to
find
new
scope
for
operation
in
industry
and
traffic
nor
does
it
matter
if
in
the
first
case
some
of
the
companies
are
fraudulent
and
fail
in
due
course
or
if
in
the
second
case
the
borrowing
state
finally
goes
bankrupt
if
the
owners
sometimes
lose
part
of
their
capital
in
one
way
or
another
even
the
country
of
origin
is
not
immune
and
individual
capitals
frequently
get
lost
in
crises
the
important
point
is
that
capital
accumulated
in
the
old
country
should
find
elsewhere
new
opportunities
to
beget
and
realise
surplus
value
so
that
accumulation
can
proceed
in
the
new
countries
large
regions
of
natural
economy
are
open
to
conversion
into
commodity
economy
or
existing
commodity
economy
can
be
ousted
by
capital
railroad
construction
and
mining
gold
mining
in
particular
are
typical
for
the
investment
of
capitals
from
old
capitalist
countries
in
new
ones
they
are
qualified
to
stimulate
a
brisk
traffic
in
goods
under
conditions
hitherto
determined
by
natural
economy
and
both
are
significant
in
economic
history
as
along
the
route
of
rapid
dissolution
of
old
economic
organisations
of
social
crises
and
of
the
development
of
modern
conditions
that
is
to
say
of
the
development
of
commodity
economy
to
begin
with
and
further
of
the
production
of
capital
for
this
reason
the
part
played
by
lending
abroad
as
well
as
by
capital
investments
in
foreign
railway
and
mining
shares
is
a
fine
sample
of
the
deficiencies
in
marx
diagram
of
accumulation
in
these
instances
enlarged
reproduction
of
capital
capitalises
a
surplus
value
that
has
already
been
realised
in
so
far
as
the
loans
or
foreign
investments
are
not
financed
by
the
savings
of
the
petty
bourgeoisie
or
the
it
is
quite
irrelevant
to
the
present
field
of
accumulation
when
where
and
how
the
capital
of
the
old
countries
has
been
realised
so
that
it
may
flow
into
the
new
country
british
capital
which
finds
an
outlet
in
argentine
railway
construction
might
well
in
the
past
have
been
realised
in
china
in
the
form
of
indian
opium
further
the
british
capital
which
builds
railways
in
the
argentine
is
of
english
origin
not
only
in
its
pure
as
money
capital
but
also
in
its
material
form
as
iron
coal
and
machinery
the
of
the
surplus
value
that
is
to
say
has
also
come
into
being
from
the
very
beginning
in
the
suitable
for
the
purposes
of
accumulation
the
actual
of
the
variable
capital
however
labour
power
is
mainly
foreign
it
is
the
native
labour
of
the
new
countries
which
is
made
a
new
object
of
exploitation
by
the
capital
of
the
old
countries
if
we
want
to
keep
our
investigation
all
on
one
plane
we
may
even
assume
that
the
labour
power
too
has
the
same
country
of
origin
as
the
capital
in
point
of
fact
new
discoveries
of
gold
mines
for
instance
tend
to
call
forth
mass
emigration
from
the
old
countries
especially
in
the
first
stages
and
are
largely
worked
by
labour
from
those
countries
it
might
well
be
then
that
in
a
new
country
capital
labour
power
and
means
of
production
all
come
from
the
same
capitalist
country
say
england
so
it
is
really
in
england
that
all
the
material
conditions
for
accumulation
exist
a
realised
surplus
value
as
money
capital
a
surplus
product
in
productive
form
and
lastly
labour
reserves
yet
accumulation
can
not
proceed
here
england
and
her
old
buyers
require
neither
railways
nor
an
expanded
industry
enlarged
reproduction
accumulation
is
possible
only
if
new
districts
with
a
civilisation
extending
over
large
areas
appear
on
the
scene
and
augment
the
number
of
consumers
but
then
who
are
these
new
consumers
actually
who
is
it
that
realises
the
surplus
value
of
capitalist
enterprises
which
are
started
with
foreign
loans
and
who
in
the
final
analysis
pays
for
these
loans
the
international
loans
in
egypt
provide
a
classical
answer
the
internal
history
of
egypt
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
characterised
by
the
interplay
of
three
phenomena
capitalist
enterprise
a
rapidly
growing
public
debt
and
the
collapse
of
peasant
economy
until
quite
recently
prevailed
in
egypt
and
the
wali
and
later
the
khedive
freely
pursued
their
own
power
policy
with
regard
to
the
condition
of
landownership
these
primitive
conditions
precisely
offered
an
incomparably
fertile
soil
for
the
operations
of
european
capital
economically
speaking
the
conditions
for
a
monetary
economy
had
to
be
established
to
begin
with
and
the
state
created
them
by
direct
compulsion
until
the
thirties
mehemet
ali
the
founder
of
modern
egypt
here
applied
a
method
of
patriarchal
simplicity
every
year
he
up
the
entire
harvest
for
the
public
exchequer
and
allowed
them
to
buy
back
at
a
higher
price
a
minimum
for
subsistence
and
seed
in
addition
he
imported
cotton
from
east
india
sugar
cane
from
america
indigo
and
pepper
and
issued
the
fellaheen
with
official
directions
what
to
plant
and
how
much
of
it
the
government
again
claimed
the
monopoly
for
cotton
and
indigo
reserving
to
itself
the
exclusive
right
of
buying
and
selling
these
goods
by
such
methods
was
commodity
exchange
introduced
in
egypt
admittedly
mehemet
ali
also
did
something
towards
raising
labour
productivity
he
arranged
for
dredging
of
the
ancient
canalisation
and
above
all
he
started
the
work
of
the
great
kaliub
nile
dams
which
initiated
the
series
of
great
capitalist
enterprises
in
egypt
these
were
to
comprise
four
great
fields
irrigation
systems
in
which
the
kaliub
works
built
between
and
take
first
place
quite
apart
from
unpaid
forced
labour
they
swallowed
up
and
incidentally
proved
quite
useless
at
first
routes
for
traffic
the
most
important
construction
which
proved
ultimately
detrimental
to
egypt
being
the
suez
canal
the
cultivation
of
cotton
and
the
production
of
sugar
cane
with
the
building
of
the
suez
canal
egypt
became
caught
up
in
the
web
of
european
capitalism
never
again
to
get
free
of
it
french
capital
led
the
way
with
british
capital
hard
on
its
heels
in
the
twenty
years
that
followed
the
internal
disturbances
in
egypt
were
coloured
by
the
competitive
struggle
between
these
two
capitals
french
capital
was
perhaps
the
most
peculiar
exponent
of
the
european
methods
of
capital
accumulation
at
the
expense
of
primitive
conditions
its
operations
were
responsible
for
the
useless
nile
dams
as
well
as
for
the
suez
canal
egypt
first
contracted
to
supply
the
labour
of
serfs
free
of
charge
for
a
number
of
years
and
secondly
to
take
up
shares
in
the
suez
company
to
the
tune
of
per
cent
of
the
company
total
capital
all
this
for
the
sake
of
breaking
through
a
canal
which
would
deflect
the
entire
trade
between
europe
and
asia
from
egypt
and
would
painfully
affect
her
part
in
this
trade
these
formed
the
nucleus
for
egypt
immense
national
debt
which
was
to
bring
about
her
military
occupation
by
britain
twenty
years
later
in
the
irrigation
system
sudden
transformations
were
initiated
the
ancient
of
which
had
been
busy
for
months
in
the
year
in
the
nile
delta
alone
were
partially
replaced
by
steam
pumps
modern
steamers
now
plied
on
the
nile
between
cairo
and
assuan
but
the
most
profound
change
in
the
economic
conditions
of
egypt
was
brought
about
by
the
cultivation
of
cotton
this
became
almost
epidemic
in
egypt
when
owing
to
the
american
war
of
secession
and
the
english
cotton
famine
the
price
per
short
ton
rose
from
something
between
and
to
everybody
was
planting
cotton
and
foremost
among
all
the
viceroy
and
his
family
his
estates
grew
fat
what
with
land
robbery
confiscations
forced
or
plain
theft
he
suddenly
appropriated
villages
by
the
score
though
without
any
legal
excuse
within
an
incredibly
short
time
this
vast
demesne
was
brought
under
cotton
with
the
result
that
the
entire
technique
of
egyptian
traditional
agriculture
was
revolutionised
dams
were
thrown
up
everywhere
to
protect
the
cotton
fields
from
the
seasonal
flooding
of
the
nile
and
a
comprehensive
system
of
artificial
irrigation
was
introduced
these
waterworks
together
with
continuous
deep
ploughing
a
novel
departure
for
the
fellah
who
had
until
then
merely
scratched
his
soil
with
a
plough
dating
back
to
the
pharaohs
and
finally
the
intensive
labours
of
the
harvest
made
between
them
enormous
demands
on
egypt
labour
power
this
was
throughout
the
same
forced
peasant
labour
over
which
the
state
claimed
to
have
an
unrestricted
right
of
disposal
and
thousands
had
already
been
employed
on
the
kaliub
dams
and
the
suez
canal
and
now
the
irrigation
and
plantation
work
to
be
done
on
the
viceregal
estates
clamoured
for
this
forced
labour
the
serfs
who
had
been
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
suez
canal
company
were
now
required
by
the
khedive
himself
and
this
brought
about
the
first
clash
with
french
capital
the
company
was
adjudged
a
compensation
of
by
the
arbitration
of
napoleon
iii
a
settlement
to
which
the
khedive
could
all
the
more
readily
agree
since
the
very
fellaheen
whose
labour
power
was
the
bone
of
contention
were
ultimately
to
be
mulcted
of
this
sum
the
work
of
irrigation
was
immediately
put
in
hand
centrifugal
machines
steam
and
traction
engines
were
therefore
ordered
from
england
and
france
in
their
hundreds
they
were
carried
by
steamers
from
england
to
alexandria
and
then
further
steam
ploughs
were
needed
for
cultivating
the
soil
especially
since
the
rinderpest
of
had
killed
off
all
the
cattle
england
again
being
the
chief
supplier
of
these
machines
the
fowler
works
were
expanded
enormously
of
a
sudden
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
viceroy
for
which
egypt
had
to
pay
but
now
egypt
required
yet
a
third
type
of
machine
cotton
gins
and
presses
for
packing
dozens
of
these
gins
were
set
up
in
the
delta
towns
like
english
industrial
towns
sagasis
tanta
samanud
and
other
towns
were
covered
by
palls
of
smoke
and
great
fortunes
circulated
in
the
banks
of
alexandria
and
cairo
but
already
in
the
year
that
followed
this
cotton
speculation
collapsed
with
the
cotton
prices
which
fell
in
a
couple
of
days
from
per
pound
to
and
finally
after
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
the
american
union
the
following
year
ismail
pasha
ventured
on
a
new
speculation
the
production
of
cane
sugar
the
forced
labour
of
the
fellaheen
was
to
compete
with
the
southern
states
of
the
union
where
slavery
had
been
abolished
for
the
second
time
egyptian
agriculture
was
turned
upside
down
french
and
british
capitalists
found
a
new
field
for
rapid
accumulation
giant
sugar
factories
were
put
on
order
in
with
an
estimated
daily
output
of
short
tons
of
sugar
that
is
to
say
four
times
as
much
as
that
of
the
greatest
then
existing
plant
six
of
them
were
ordered
from
england
and
twelve
from
france
but
england
eventually
delivered
the
lion
share
because
of
the
war
these
factories
were
to
be
built
along
the
nile
at
intervals
of
miles
as
centres
of
cane
plantations
of
an
area
comprising
sq
working
to
full
capacity
each
factory
required
a
daily
supply
of
tons
of
sugar
cane
fellaheen
were
driven
to
forced
labour
on
the
sugar
plantations
in
their
thousands
while
further
thousands
of

funiculars
had
to

as

again
these
enormous

were
placed
with

the

was
opened
in

providing
makeshift
transport
but
it
proved
to
be
simply
impossible
to
supply
cane
in
the
quantities
required
by
the
undertaking
the
working
staff
was
completely
inadequate
since
the

accustomed
to
forced
labour
on

could
not
be
transformed
overnight
into
a
modern
industrial
worker
by
the
lash
of

the

collapsed
even
before

this

the

of

egypt
total

grown
from

was
imminent
these
operations
of
capital
at
first
sight
seem
to
reach
the
height
of
madness
one
loan
followed
hard
on
the
other
the
interest
on
old
loans
was
defrayed
by
new
loans
and
capital
borrowed
from
the
british
and
french
paid
for
the
large
orders
placed
with
british
and
french
industrial
capital
while
the
whole
of
europe
sighed
and
shrugged
its
shoulders
at
crazy
economy
european
capital
was
in
fact
doing
business
in
egypt
on
a
unique
and
fantastic
scale
an
incredible
modern
version
of
the
biblical
legend
about
the
fat
kine
which
remains
unparalleled
in
capitalist
history
in
the
first
place
there
was
an
element
of
usury
in
every
loan
anything
between
and
of
the
money
ostensibly
lent
sticking
to
the
fingers
of
the
european
bankers
ultimately
the
exorbitant
interest
had
to
be
paid
somehow
but
how
where
were
the
means
to
come
from
egypt
herself
was
to
supply
them
their
source
was
the
egyptian
fellah
peasant
economy
providing
in
the
final
analysis
all
the
most
important
elements
for
capitalist
enterprise
he
provided
the
land
since
the
private
estates
of
the
khedive
were
quickly
growing
to
vast
dimensions
by
robbery
and
blackmail
of
innumerable
villages
and
these
estates
were
the
foundations
of
the
irrigation
projects
and
the
speculation
in
cotton
and
sugar
cane
as
forced
labour
the
fellah
also
provided
the
labour
power
and
what
is
more
he
was
exploited
without
payment
and
even
had
to
provide
his
own
means
of
subsistence
while
he
was
at
work
the
marvels
of
technique
which
european
engineers
and
european
machines
performed
in
the
sphere
of
egyptian
irrigation
transport
agriculture
and
industry
were
due
to
this
peasant
economy
with
its
fellaheen
serfs
on
the
kaliub
nile
dams
and
on
the
suez
canal
in
the
cotton
plantations
and
in
the
sugar
plants
untold
masses
of
peasants
were
put
to
work
they
were
switched
over
from
one
job
to
the
next
as
the
need
arose
and
they
were
exploited
to
the
limit
of
endurance
and
beyond
although
it
became
evident
at
every
step
that
there
were
technical
limits
to
the
employment
of
forced
labour
for
the
purposes
of
modern
capital
yet
this
was
amply
compensated
by
capital
unrestricted
power
of
command
over
the
pool
of
labour
power
how
long
and
under
what
conditions
men
were
to
work
live
and
be
exploited
but
not
alone
that
it
supplied
land
and
labour
power
peasant
economy
also
provided
the
money
under
the
influence
of
capitalist
economy
the
screws
were
put
on
the
fellaheen
by
taxation
the
tax
on
peasant
holdings
was
persistently
increased
in
the
late
sixties
it
amounted
to
per
but
not
a
farthing
was
levied
on
the
enormous
private
estates
of
the
royal
family
in
addition
ever
more
special
rates
were
devised
contributions
of
per
had
to
be
paid
for
the
maintenance
of
the
irrigation
system
which
almost
exclusively
benefited
the
royal
estates
and
the
fellah
had
to
pay
for
every
date

every
clay

in
which
he
lived

desperate
the
time
drew

when
the
country
and
all
her

to
become
the
prey
of
european
capital
october
saw
the
representatives
of
the
european
creditors
landing
in

british
and
french
capital
established
dual
control
of

and
devised
new
taxes
the
peasants
were
beaten
and
oppressed
so
that
payment
of

temporarily
suspended
in
could
be
resumed
in
now
the
claims
of
european
capital
became
the
pivot
of
economic
life
and
the
sole
consideration
of
the
financial
system
in
a
new
commission
and
ministry
were
set
up
both
with
a
staff
in
which
europeans
made
up
one
half
in
the
finances
of
egypt
were
brought
under
permanent
control
of
european
capital
exercised
by
the
de
la

publique
in
cairo
in
the
tshifliks
estates
of
the
viceregal
family
which
comprised
acres
were
converted
into
crown
land
and
pledged
to
the
european
capitalists
as
collateral
for
the
public
debt
and
the
same
happened
to
the
daira
lands
the
private
estates
of
the
khedive
comprising
acres
mainly
in
upper
egypt
this
was
at
a
later
date
sold
to
a
syndicate
the
other
estates
for
the
greatest
part
fell
to
capitalist
companies
the
suez
canal
company
in
particular
to
cover
the
cost
of
occupation
england
requisitioned
ecclesiastical
lands
of
the
mosques
and
schools
an
opportune
pretext
for
the
final
blow
was
provided
by
a
mutiny
in
the
egyptian
army
starved
under
european
financial
control
while
european
officials
were
drawing
excellent
salaries
and
by
a
revolt
engineered
among
the
alexandrian
masses
who
had
been
bled
white
the
british
military
occupied
egypt
in
as
a
result
of
twenty
years
operations
of
big
business
never
to
leave
again
this
was
the
ultimate
and
final
step
in
the
process
of
liquidating
peasant
economy
in
egypt
by
and
for
european
capital
it
should
now
be
clear
that
the
transactions
between
european
loan
capital
and
european
industrial
capital
are
based
upon
relations
which
are
extremely
rational
and
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
although
they
appear
absurd
to
the
casual
observer
because
this
loan
capital
pays
for
the
orders
from
egypt
and
the
interest
on
one
loan
is
paid
out
of
a
new
loan
stripped
of
all
obscuring
connecting
links
these
relations
consist
in
the
simple
fact
that
european
capital
has
largely
swallowed
up
the
egyptian
peasant
economy
enormous
tracts
of
land
labour
and
labour
products
without
number
accruing
to
the
state
as
taxes
have
ultimately
been
converted
into
european
capital
and
have
been
accumulated
evidently
only
by
use
of
the
could
the
historical
development
which
would
normally
take
centuries
be
compressed
into
two
or
three
decades
and
it
was
just
the
primitive
nature
of
egyptian
conditions
which
proved
such
fertile
soil
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
as
against
the
fantastic
increase
of
capital
on
the
one
hand
the
other
economic
result
is
the
ruin
of
peasant
economy
together
with
the
growth
of
commodity
exchange
which
is
rooted
in
the
supreme
exertion
of
the
country
productive
forces
under
ismail
rule
the

to
this
development
of

which
expanded
by
leaps

bounds
with

had
fallen
a
prey

as

economy
fast
enough

are
swallowed
up
by
international
capital
since
they
can
not
perform
these
transformations
without
selling
their
souls
to
capital
their
feverish
metamorphoses
are
tantamount
to
their
absorption
by

is
the

made
by

in

it

but
this

must
be
realised
together
with

how

for

the

of

into

these
are
turned
into

in

to
realise

plus

that
is
the
true
object
of
the

run

and
of
the
collateral
in
the
case
of

in
both
instances
tithes
pledged
in
different
ways
are
paid
in
kind
by
the
turkish
peasant
and
these
were
gradually
increased
from
about
to
per
cent
the
peasant
in
the
asiatic
must
pay
up
or
else
his
tithe
would
simply
be
confiscated
by
the
police
and
the
central
and
local
authorities
these
tithes
themselves
a
manifestation
of
ancient
asiatic
despotism
based
on
natural
economy
are
not
collected
by
the
turkish
government
direct
but
by
not
unlike
the
of
the
that
is
to
say
the
expected
returns
from
the
levy
in
each
are
separately
auctioned
by
the
state
to
they
are
bought
by
individual
speculators
or
syndicates
who
sell
the
tithes
of
each
district
to
other
speculators
and
these
resell
their
shares
to
a
whole
number
of
smaller
agents
all
these
middlemen
want
to
cover
their
expenses
and
make
the
greatest
possible
profit
and
thus
by
the
time
they
are
actually
collected
the
peasants
contributions
have
swollen
to
enormous
dimensions
the
will
try
to
recoup
himself
for
any
mistake
in
his
calculations
at
the
expense
of
the
peasant
and
the
latter
nearly
always
in
debt
is
impatient
for
the
moment
when
he
can
sell
his
harvest
but
often
after
cutting
his
corn
he
can
not
start
threshing
for
weeks
until
indeed
the
deigns
to
take
his
due
his
entire
harvest
is
about
to
rot
in
the
fields
and
the
usually
a
grain
merchant
himself
takes
advantage
of
this
fact
and
compels
him
to
sell
at
a
low
price

know
how
to
enlist
the
support
of
the

especially
the
muktars
the
local
headmen
against
complaining
malcontents
along
with
the
taxes
on
salt

excise

are

with
the

the

every
case

reserves
to
itself
the
right
to
vet
the
contracts
and
stipulates
for
the
proceeds
of
the
tithe
to
be
paid
directly
into
the
coffers
of
its
regional
offices
if
no
can
be
found
the
tithes
are
stored
in

by
the
turkish
government
the
warehouse
keys
are
deposited
with
the
which
then
can
sell
the

on
its
own
account
thus
the
economic
metabolism
between

peasants
of

syria
and
mesopotamia
on
the
one
hand
and
german
capital
on
the
other
proceeds
in
the
following
way
in
the
konya
baghdad
bazra
the
grain
comes
into
being
as
a
simple
of
primitive
peasant
economy
it
immediately
falls
to
the
as
a
state
levy
only
then
in
the
hands
of
this
latter
does
it
become
a
commodity
and
as
such
money
which
falls
to
the
state
this
money
is
nothing
but
converted
peasant
grain
it
was
not
even
produced
as
a
commodity
but
now
as
a
state
guarantee
it
serves
towards
paying
for
the
construction
and
operation
of
railways
to
realise
both
the
value
of
the
means
of
production
and
the
surplus
value
extorted
from
the
asiatic
peasants
and
proletariat
in
the
building
and
running
of
the
railway
in
this
process
further
means
of
production
of
german
origin
are
used
and
so
the
peasant
grain
of
asia
converted
into
money
also
serves
to
turn
into
cash
the
surplus
value
that
has
been
extorted
from
the
german
workers
in
the
performance
of
these
functions
the
money
rolls
from
the
hands
of
the
turkish
government
into
the
coffers
of
the
and
here
it
accumulates
as
capitalist
surplus
value
in
the
form
of
promoters
profits
royalties
dividends
and
interests
in
the
accounts
of
gwinner
siemens
stinnes
and
their
fellow
directors
of
the
shareholders
and
clients
of
the
and
the
whole
intricate
system
of
its
subsidiary
companies
if
there
is
no
as
provided
in
the
concessions
then
the
complicated
metamorphoses
are
reduced
to
their
most
simple
and
obvious
terms
the
peasant
grain
passes
immediately
to
the
de
la
dette
publique
to
the
representatives
of
european
capital
and
becomes
already
in
its
natural
form
a
revenue
for
german
and
other
foreign
capital
it
realises
capitalist
surplus
value
even
before
it
has
shed
its
for
the
asiatic
peasant
even
before
it
has
become
a
commodity
and
its
own
value
has
been
realised
this
is
a
coarse
and
straightforward
metabolism
between
european
capital
and
asiatic
peasant
economy
with
the
turkish
state
reduced
to
its
real
rôle
that
of
a
political
machinery
for
exploiting
peasant
economy
for
capitalist
purposes
the
real
function
this
of
all
oriental
states
in

this

it
cuts
the
very
ground
from
under
the
feet
of
capitalist
accumulation
though
imperialism
is
the
historical
method
for
prolonging
the
career
of
capitalism
it
is
also
a
sure
means
of
bringing
it
to
a
swift
conclusion
this
is
not
to
say
that
capitalist
development
must
be
actually
driven
to
this
extreme
the
mere
tendency
towards
imperialism
of
itself
takes
forms
which
make
the
final
phase
of
capitalism
a
period
of
catastrophe
classical
economics
in
its
period
of
storm
and
stress
had
had
high
hopes
of
a
peaceful
development
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
and
of
a
trade
and
industry
which
can
only
prosper
in
times
of
peace
evolving
the
orthodox
manchester
ideology
of
the
harmony
of
interests
among
the
world
commercial
nations
on
the
one
hand
and
between
capital
and
labour
on
the
other
these
hopes
were
apparently
justified
in
europe
by
the
short
period
of
free
trade
in
the
sixties
and
seventies
which
was
based
upon
the
mistaken
doctrine
of
the
english
free
traders
that
the
only
theoretical
and
practical
condition
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
is
commodity
exchange
that
the
two
are
identical
as
we
have
seen
ricardo
and
his
whole
school
identified
accumulation
and
its
reproductive
conditions
with
simple
commodity
production
and
the
conditions
of
simple
commodity
circulation
this
was
soon
to
become
even
more
obvious
in
the
practices
of
the
common
free
trader
the
special
interests
of
the
exporting
lancashire
cotton
manufacturers
in
manchester
determined
the
entire
line
of
argument
of
the
cobden
league
their
principal
object
was
to
get
markets
and
it
became
an
article
of
faith
from
foreign
countries
and
thus
in
turn
sell
our
industrial
product
our
cotton
goods
on
the
new
markets
cobden
and
bright
demanded
free
trade
and
cheaper
foodstuffs
in
particular
in
the
interest
of
consumption
but
the
consumer
was
not
the
worker
who
eats
the
bread
but
the
capitalist
who
consumes
labour
power
this
teaching
never
expressed
the
interests
of
capitalist
accumulation
as
a
whole
in
england
herself
it
was
given
the
lie
already
in
the
forties
when
the
harmony
of
interests
of
the
commercial
nations
in
the
east
were
proclaimed
to
the
sound
of
gunfire
in
the
opium
wars
which
ultimately
by
the
annexation
of
hongkong
brought
about
the
very
opposite
of
such
harmony
a
system
of
of
interest
on
the
european
continent
free
trade
in
the
sixties
did
not
represent
the
interests
of
industrial
capital
because
the
foremost
free
trade
countries
of
the
continent
were
still
predominantly
agrarian
with
a
comparatively
feeble
development
of
industry
rather
the
policy
of
free
trade
was
implemented
as
a
means
for
the
political
reconstruction
of
the
central
european
states
in
germany
under
bismarck
and
manteuffel
it
was
a
peculiarly
prussian
lever
for
ousting
austria
from
the
and
the
and
to
set
up
the
new
german
empire
under
prussian
leadership
economically
speaking
the
mainstays
of
free
trade
were
in
this
case
the
interests
both
of
commercial
capital
especially
in
the
hansa
towns
to
whom
international
trade
was
vital
and
of
agrarian
consumers
among
industry
proper
it
was
otherwise
the
iron
industry
was
won
over
only
with
difficulty
and
in
exchange
for
the
abolition
of
the
rhine
tolls
but
the
cotton
industry
in
southern
germany
remained
irreconcilable
and
clung
to
protective
tariffs
in
france
favoured
nations
clause
agreements
the
basis
of
the
free
trade
system
all
over
europe
were
concluded
by
napoleon
iii
without
the
consent
and
even
against
the
will
of
parliament
industrialists
and
agrarians
who
constituted
an
absolute
majority
being
in
favour
of
protective
tariffs
the
government
of
the
second
empire
only
took
the
course
of
commercial
treaties
as
an
emergency
measure
britain
accepted
it
as
such
in
order
to
get
round
political
opposition
in
france
and
to
establish
free
trade
behind
the
back
of
the
legislature
by
international
action
the
first
principal
treaty
between
england
and
france
simply
rode
over
public
opinion
in
france
two
imperial
decrees
abolished
the
old
system
of
french
protective
tariffs
which
had
been
in
force
from
to
with
scant
observance
of
the
formalities
they
were
in
in
italy
free
trade
was
a
prop
of
cavour
policy
depending
as
it
did
on
french
support
under
pressure
of
public
opinion
an
inquiry
was
made
in
which
revealed
that
those
most
intimately
concerned
were
hostile
to
the
policy
of
free
trade
in
russia
finally
the
tendency
towards
free
trade
in
the
sixties
was
but
the
first
step
towards
creating
a
broad
basis
for
commodity
economy
and
industry
on
a
large
scale
coming
at
the
same
time
as
the
abolition
of
serfdom
and
the
construction
of
a
railway
network
thus
the
very
inception
of
an
international
system
of
free
trade
shows
it
to
be
just
a
passing
phase
in
the
history
of
capitalist
accumulation
and
it
shows
up
the
fallacy
of
attributing
the
general
reversion
to
protective
tariffs
after
the
seventies
simply
to
a
defensive
reaction
against
english
free
trade
such
an
explanation
is
vitiated
by
the
fact
that
both
in
germany
and
france
the
leaders
in
the
reversion
to
protective
tariffs
were
the
agrarian
interests
that
the
measures
were
directed
not
against
british
but
against
american
competition
and
that
not
england
but
germany
constituted
the
chief
danger
to
the
rising
home
industry
in
russia
and
france
to
that
in
italy
nor
was
britain
monopoly
the
cause
for
the
depression
which
prevailed
since
the
seventies
and
induced
the
desire
for
protective
tariffs
we
must
look
deeper
for
the
reasons
responsible
for
the
change
of
front
on
the
question
of
protective
tariffs
the
doctrine
of
free
trade
with
its
delusion
about
the
harmony
of
interests
on
the
world
market
corresponded
with
an
outlook
which
conceived
of
everything
in
terms
of
commodity
exchange
it
was
abandoned
just
as
soon
as
big
industrial
capital
had
become
sufficiently
established
in
the
principal
countries
of
the
european
continent
to
look
to
the
conditions
for
its
accumulation
as
against
the
mutual
interests
of
capitalist
countries
these
latter
bring
to
the
fore
the
antagonism
engendered
by
the
competitive
struggle
for
the
environment
when
the
free
trade
era
opened
eastern
asia
was
only
just
being
made
accessible
by
the
chinese
wars
and
european
capital
had
but
begun
to
make
headway
in
egypt
in
the
eighties
the
policy
of
expansion
became
ever
stronger
together
with
a
policy
of
protective
tariffs
there
was
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
events
during
the
eighties
the
british
occupation
of
egypt
germany
colonial
conquests
in
africa
the
french
occupation
of
tunisia
together
with
the
tonkin
expedition
advances
in
assab
and
massawa
the
abyssinian
war
and
the
creation
of
a
separate
eritrea
and
the
english
conquests
in
south
africa
the
clash
between
italy
and
france
over
the
tunisian
sphere
of
interest
was
the
characteristic
prelude
to
the
tariff
war
seven
years
later
by
which
drastic
epilogue
an
end
was
made
to
the
free
trade
harmony
of
interests
on
the
european
continent
to
monopolise
the
areas
at
home
and
abroad
became
the
of
capital
while
the
policy
of
the
door
specifically
represented
the
peculiar
helplessness
of
countries
in
the
face
of
international
capital
and
the
natural
equilibrium
which
was
aimed
at
by
its
competition
in
the
preliminary
stage
of
the
partial
or
total
occupation
of
these
areas
as
colonies
or
spheres
of
interest
as
the
oldest
capitalist
empire
england
alone
could
so
far
remain
loyal
to
free
trade
primarily
because
she
had
long
had
immense
possessions
of
areas
as
a
basis
for
operations
which
afforded
her
almost
unlimited
opportunities
for
capitalist
accumulation
until
recently
she
had
thus
in
fact
been
beyond
the
competition
of
other
capitalist
countries
these
in
turn
universally
strove
to
become
behind
a
barrier
of
protective
tariffs
yet
they
buy
one
commodities
and
come
to
depend
ever
more
one
upon
another
for
replenishing
their
material
conditions
of
reproduction
indeed
protective
tariffs
have
by
now
completely
lost
their
use
for
technical
development
of
the
productive
forces
all
too
often
being
the
instrument
for
the
artificial
conservation
of
obsolete
productive
methods
the
inherent
contradictions
of
an
international
policy
of
protective
tariffs
exactly
like
the
dual
character
of
the
international
loan
system
are
just
a
reflection
of
the
historical
antagonism
which
has
developed
between
the
dual
interests
of
accumulation
expansion
the
realisation
and
capitalisation
of
surplus
value
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
an
outlook
which
conceives
of
everything
purely
in
terms
of
commodity
exchange
this
fact
is
evidenced
particularly
in
that
the
modern
system
of
high
protective
tariffs
required
by
colonial
expansion
and
the
increasing
inner
tension
of
the
capitalist
medium
was
also
instituted
with
a
view
to
increasing
armaments
the
reversion
to
protective
tariffs
was
carried
through
in
germany
as
well
as
in
france
italy
and
russia
together
with
and
in
the
interests
of
an
expansion
of
the
armed
services
as
the
basis
for
the
european
competition
in
armaments
which
was
developing
at
that
time
first
on
land
and
then
also
at
sea
european
free
trade
with
its
attendant
continental
system
of
infantry
had
been
superseded
by
protective
tariffs
as
the
foundation
and
supplement
of
an
imperialist
system
with
a
strong
bias
towards
naval
power
thus
capitalist
accumulation
as
a
whole
as
an
actual
historical
process
has
two
different
aspects
one
concerns
the
commodity
market
and
the
place
where
surplus
value
is
produced
the
factory
the
mine
the
agricultural
estate
regarded
in
this
light
accumulation
is
a
purely
economic
process
with
its
most
important
phase
a
transaction
between
the
capitalist
and
wage
labourer
in
both
its
phases
however
it
is
confined
to
the
exchange
of
equivalents
and
remains
within
the
limits
of
commodity
exchange
here
in
form
at
any
rate
peace
property
and
equality
prevail
and
the
keen
dialectics
of
scientific
analysis
were
required
to
reveal
how
the
right
of
ownership
changes
in
the
course
of
accumulation
into
appropriation
of
other
people
property
how
commodity
exchange
turns
into
exploitation
and
equality
becomes
the
other
aspect
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
concerns
the
relations
between
capitalism
and
the
modes
of
production
which
start
making
their
appearance
on
the
international
stage
its
predominant
methods
are
colonial
policy
an
international
loan
system
a
policy
of
spheres
of
interest
and
war
force
fraud
oppression
looting
are
openly
displayed
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
and
it
requires
an
effort
to
discover
within
this
tangle
of
political
violence
and
contests
of
power
the
stern
laws
of
the
economic
process
bourgeois
liberal
theory
takes
into
account
only
the
former
aspect
the
realm
of
competition
the
marvels
of
technology
and
pure
commodity
exchange
it
separates
it
strictly
from
the
other
aspect
the
realm
of
capital
blustering
violence
which
is
regarded
as
more
or
less
incidental
to
foreign
policy
and
quite
independent
of
the
economic
sphere
of
capital
in
reality
political
power
is
nothing
but
a
vehicle
for
the
economic
process
the
conditions
for
the
reproduction
of
capital
provide
the
organic
link
between
these
two
aspects
of
the
accumulation
of
capital
the
historical
career
of
capitalism
can
only
be
appreciated
by
taking
them
together
blood
and
filth
with
every
pore
from
head
to
toe
characterises
not
only
the
birth
of
capital
but
also
its
progress
in
the
world
at
every
step
and
thus
capitalism
prepares
its
own
downfall
under
ever
more
violent
contortions
and
convulsions
footnotes
and
not

in

had
to

up
the

was

successful
though
the

better
declaring
whenever

that
it
was

denouncing

this
declaration
came
like
a
bolt
from

after
the
events
of
the
past
year
the
general
belief
was
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
modify
the

before

ran

but
all
the

and
the
ultimate
of

system
of

to
protective

were
a
manifestation
and
corollary
of
the
progressive
reforms
which
the
disastrous
crimean
wars
had
made
inevitable
but
the
reduction
of
customs
duties
reflected
the
concern
of
the
landowning
gentry
who
both
as
consumers
of
foreign
goods
and
as
producers
of

for
export
were
interested
in
unrestricted

brought
to
a
precarious
position
owing
to
four
great
setbacks
these
could
in
every
case
be
directly
attributed
to
excessive
tariffs
on
the
other
hand
the
years
between
and
when
tariffs
were
moderate
went
by
without
any
such
emergency
in
spite
of
three
foreign
wars
and
one
civil
war
meaning
the
polish
insurrection
of
every
one
of
which
proved
a
greater
or
less
strain
on
the
financial
resources
of
the
state
of
the
imperial
free
economic
association
on
revising
russian
petersburg
as
late
as
the
nineties
then
the
scientific
spokesman
of
the
free
trade
movement
the
said
economic
association
had
to
agitate
against
protective
tariffs
as
a
to
capitalist
industry
to
russia
in
a
reactionary
spirit
it
denounced
capitalism
as
a
breeding
ground
for
the
modern
proletariat
masses
of
shiftless
people
without
home
or
property
who
have
nothing
to
lose
and
have
long
been
in
ill
repute
this
is
proof
enough
that
until
most
recent
times
the
russian
champions
of
free
trade
or
at
least
of
moderate
tariffs
did
not
to
any
appreciable
extent
represent
the
interests
of
industrial
capital
cf
also
lodyshenski
history
of
the
russian
petersburg
pp
this
is
also
the
opinion
of
engels
in
one
of
his
letters
to
nikolayon
on
june
he
writes
authors
blinded
by
their
patriotic
interests
completely
fail
to
grasp
why
the
whole
world
so
stubbornly
rejects
england
example
of
free
trade
and
adopts
in
its
place
the
principle
of
protective
tariffs
of
course
they
simply
dare
not
admit
even
to
themselves
that
the
system
of
protective
tariffs
by
now
almost
universal
is
merely
a
defensive
measure
against
english
free
trade
which
was
instrumental
in
perfecting
england
industrial
monopoly
such
a
defence
policy
may
be
more
or
less
reasonable
in
some
cases
it
is
downright
stupid
as
for
instance
in
germany
who
under
the
system
of
free
trade
had
become
a
great
industrial
power
and
now
imposes
protective
tariffs
on
agricultural
products
and
raw
materials
thus
increasing
the
cost
of
her
industrial
production
in
my
view
this
universal
reversion
to
protective
tariffs
is
not
a
mere
accident
but
the
reaction
against
england
intolerable
industrial
monopoly
the
form
which
this
reaction
takes
as
i
said
before
may
be
wrong
inadequate
and
even
worse
but
its
historical
necessity
seems
to
me
quite
clear
and
obvious
of
karl
marx
and
frederick
engels
to
nikolayon
petersburg
militarism
as
a
province
of
accumulation
militarism
fulfils
a
quite
definite
function
in
the
history
of
capital
accompanying
as
it
does
every
historical
phase
of
accumulation
it
plays
a
decisive
part
in
the
first
stages
of
european
capitalism
in
the
period
of
the
accumulation
as
a
means
of
conquering
the
new
world
and
the
countries
of
india
later
it
is
employed
to
subject
the
modern
colonies
to
destroy
the
social
organisations
of
primitive
societies
so
that
their
means
of
production
may
be
appropriated
forcibly
to
introduce
commodity
trade
in
countries
where
the
social
structure
had
been
unfavourable
to
it
and
to
turn
the
natives
into
a
proletariat
by
compelling
them
to
work
for
wages
in
the
colonies
it
is
responsible
for
the
creation
and
expansion
of
spheres
of
interest
for
european
capital
in
regions
for
extorting
railway
concessions
in
backward
countries
and
for
enforcing
the
claims
of
european
capital
as
international
lender
finally
militarism
is
a
weapon
in
the
competitive
struggle
between
capitalist
countries
for
areas
of
civilisation
in
addition
militarism
has
yet
another
important
function
from
the
purely
economic
point
of
view
it
is
a
means
for
the
realisation
of
surplus
value
it
is
in
itself
a
province
of
accumulation
in
examining
the
question
who
should
count
as
a
buyer
for
the
mass
of
products
containing
the
capitalised
surplus
value
we
have
again
and
again
refused
to
consider
the
state
and
its
organs
as
consumers
since
their
income
is
derivative
they
were
all
taken
to
belong
to
the
special
category
of
those
who
live
on
the
surplus
value
or
partly
on
the
wage
of
labour
together
with
the
liberal
professions
and
the
various
parasites
of
society
professor
prostitute
mercenary
but
this
interpretation
will
only
do
on
two
assumptions
first
if
we
take
it
in
accordance
with
marx
diagram
that
the
state
has
no
other
sources
of
taxation
than
capitalist
surplus
value
and
wages
and
secondly
if
we
regard
the
state
and
its
organs
as
consumers
pure
and
simple
if
the
issue
turns
on
the
personal
consumption
of
the
state
organs
as
also
of
the
the
point
is
that
consumption
is
partly
transferred
from
the
working
class
to
the
of
the
capitalist
class
in
so
far
as
the
workers
foot
the
bill
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
indirect
taxes
extorted
from
the
workers
which
mean
a
curtailment
of
their
consumption
are
used
entirely
to
pay
the
salaries
of
the
state
officials
and
to
provision
the
regular
army
there
will
then
be
no
change
in
the
reproduction
of
social
capital
as
a
whole
both
departments
ii
and
i
remain
constant
because
society
as
a
whole
still
demands
the
same
kind
of
products
and
in
the
same
quantities
only
as
the
commodity
of
power
has
changed
in
value
in
relation
to
the
products
of
department
ii
in
relation
to
the
means
of
subsistence
this
the
same
amount
of
money
representing
labour
power
is
now
exchanged
for
a
smaller
amount
of
means
of
subsistence
what
happens
to
the
products
of
department
ii
which
are
then
left
over
instead
of
the
workers
the
state
officials
and
the
regular
army
now
receive
them
the
organs
of
the
capitalist
state
take
over
the
workers
consumption
on
the
same
scale
exactly
although
the
conditions
of
reproduction
have
remained
stable
there
has
been
a
redistribution
of
the
total
product
part
of
the
products
of
department
ii
originally
intended
entirely
for
the
consumption
of
the
workers
as
equivalent
for
is
now
allocated
to
the
of
the
capitalist
class
for
consumption
from
the
point
of
view
of
social
reproduction
it
is
as
if
the
relative
surplus
value
had
in
the
first
place
been
larger
by
a
certain
amount
which
is
added
on
to
the
consumption
of
the
capitalist
class
and
its
so
far
the
crude
exploitation
by
the
mechanism
of
indirect
taxation
of
the
working
class
for
the
support
of
the
capitalist
state
officials
amounts
merely
to
an
increase
of
the
surplus
value
of
that
part
of
it
that
is
to
say
which
is
consumed
the
difference
is
that
this
further
splitting
off
of
surplus
value
from
variable
capital
only
comes
later
after
the
exchange
between
capital
and
labour
has
been
accomplished
but
the
consumption
by
the
organs
of
the
capitalist
state
has
no
bearing
on
the
realisation
of
surplus
value
because
the
additional
surplus
value
for
this
consumption
even
though
it
comes
about
at
the
workers
expense
is
created
afterwards
on
the
other
hand
if
the
workers
did
not
pay
for
the
greater
part
of
the
state
officials
upkeep
the
capitalists
themselves
would
have
to
bear
the
entire
cost
of
it
a
corresponding
portion
of
their
surplus
value
would
have
to
be
assigned
directly
to
keeping
the
organs
of
their
either
at
the
expense
of
production
which
would
have
to
be
curtailed
accordingly
or
which
is
more
probable
it
would
come
from
the
surplus
value
intended
for
their
consumption
the
capitalists
would
have
to
capitalise
on
a
smaller
scale
because
of
having
to
contribute
more
towards
the
immediate
preservation
of
their
own
class
in
so
far
as
they
shift
onto
the
working
class
and
also
the
representatives
of
simple
commodity
production
such
as
peasants
and
artisans
the
principal
charge
of
their
the
capitalists
have
a
larger
portion
of
surplus
value
available
for
capitalisation
but
as
yet
opportunities
for
such
have
come
into
being
no
new
market
that
is
to
say
for
the
surplus
value
that
has
become
available
in
which
it
could
produce
and
realise
new
commodities
but
when
the
monies
concentrated
in
the
exchequer
by
taxation
are
used
for
the
production
of
armaments
the
picture
is
changed
with
indirect
taxation
and
high
protective
tariffs
the
bill
of
militarism
is
footed
mainly
by
the
working
class
and
the
peasants
the
two
kinds
of
taxation
must
be
considered
separately
from
an
economic
point
of
view
it
amounts
to
the
following
as
far
as
the
working
class
is
concerned
provided
that
wages
are
not
raised
to
make
up
for
the
higher
price
of
foodstuffs
which
is
at
present
the
fate
of
the
greatest
part
of
the
working
class
including
even
the
minority
that
is
organised
in
trade
unions
owing
to
the
pressure
of
cartels
and
organisations
indirect
taxation
means
that
part
of
the
purchasing
power
of
the
working
class
is
transferred
to
the
state
now
as
before
the
variable
capital
as
a
fixed
amount
of
money
will
put
in
motion
an
appropriate
quantity
of
living
labour
that
is
to
say
it
serves
to
employ
the
appropriate
quantity
of
constant
capital
in
production
and
to
produce
the
corresponding
amount
of
surplus
value
as
soon
as
capital
has
completed
this
cycle
it
is
divided
between
the
working
class
and
the
state
the
workers
surrender
the
state
part
of
the
money
they
received
as
wages
capital
has
wholly
appropriated
the
former
variable
capital
in
its
material
form
as
labour
power
but
the
working
class
retains
only
part
of
the
variable
capital
in
the
form
of
money
the
state
claiming
the
rest
and
this
invariably
happens
after
capital
has
run
its
cycle
between
capitalist
and
worker
it
takes
place
as
it
were
behind
the
back
of
capital
at
no
point
impinging
direct
on
the
vital
stages
of
the
circulation
of
capital
and
the
production
of
surplus
value
so
that
it
is
no
immediate
concern
of
the
latter
but
all
the
same
it
does
affect
the
conditions
for
the
reproduction
of
capital
as
a
whole
the
transfer
of
some
of
the
purchasing
power
from
the
working
class
to
the
state
entails
a
proportionate
decrease
in
the
consumption
of
means
of
subsistence
by
the
working
class
for
capital
as
a
whole
it
means
producing
a
smaller
quantity
of
consumer
goods
for
the
working
class
provided
that
both
variable
capital
in
the
form
of
money
and
as
labour
power
and
the
mass
of
appropriated
surplus
value
remain
constant
so
that
the
workers
get
a
smaller
share
of
the
aggregate
product
in
the
process
of
reproduction
of
the
entire
capital
then
means
of
subsistence
will
be
produced
in
amounts
smaller
than
the
value
of
the
variable
capital
because
of
the
shift
in
the
ratio
between
the
value
of
the
variable
capital
and
the
quantity
of
means
of
subsistence
in
which
it
is
realised
with
the
money
wages
of
labour
remaining
constant
according
to
our
premise
or
at
any
rate
not
rising
sufficiently
to
offset
the
increase
in
the
price
of
foodstuffs
this
increase
represents
the
level
of
indirect
taxation
how
will
the
material
relations
of
reproduction
be
adjusted
when
fewer
means
of
subsistence
are
needed
for
the
renewal
of
labour
power
a
corresponding
amount
of
constant
capital
and
living
labour
becomes
available
which
can
now
be
used
for
producing
other
commodities
in
response
to
a
new
effective
demand
arising
within
society
it
arises
from
the
side
of
the
state
which
has
appropriated
by
way
of
tax
legislation
the
part
wanting
of
the
workers
purchasing
power
this
time
however
the
state
does
not
demand
means
of
subsistence
after
all
that
has
already
been
said
under
the
heading
of
persons
we
shall
here
ignore
the
demand
for
means
of
subsistence
for
state
officials
which
is
also
satisfied
out
of
taxes
but
it
requires
a
special
kind
of
product
namely
the
militarist
weapons
of
war
on
land
and
at
sea
again
we
take
marx
second
diagram
of
accumulation
as
the
basis
for
investigating
the
ensuing
changes
in
social
reproduction
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
now
let
us
suppose
that
owing
to
indirect
taxation
and
the
consequent
increase
in
the
price
of
means
of
subsistence
the
working
class
as
a
whole
reduces
consumption
by
say
a
value
units
of
the
real
wages
as
before
the
workers
receive
in
money
but
for
this
money
they
only
get
means
of
subsistence
to
the
value
of
the
units
which
represent
the
tax
increase
in
the
price
of
foodstuffs
go
to
the
state
which
receives
in
addition
military
taxes
from
the
peasants
to
the
value
of
units
bringing
the
total
up
to
this
total
constitutes
a
new
demand
the
demand
for
armaments
at
present
however
we
are
only
interested
in
the
units
taken
from
the
workers
wages
this
demand
for
armaments
to
the
value
of
must
be
satisfied
by
the
creation
of
an
appropriate
branch
of
production
which
requires
a
constant
capital
of
and
a
variable
capital
of
assuming
the
average
organic
composition
outlined
in
marx
diagram
weapons
of
war
this
new
branch
of
production
further
requires
that
means
of
production
be
produced
and
about
means
of
subsistence
because
of
course
the
real
wages
of
the
workers
are
also
less
by
about
you
could
counter
by
saying
that
the
profit
accruing
to
capital
from
this
new
expansion
of
demand
is
merely
on
paper
because
the
cut
in
the
actual
consumption
of
the
working
class
will
inevitably
result
in
a
corresponding
curtailment
of
the
means
of
subsistence
produced
it
will
take
the
following
form
for
department
ii
in
addition
department
i
will
also
have
to
contract
accordingly
so
that
owing
to
the
decreasing
consumption
of
the
working
class
the
equations
for
both
departments
will
be
i
ii
if
by
the
mediation
of
the
state
the
same
units
now
call
forth
armament
production
of
an
equal
volume
with
a
corresponding
fillip
to
the
production
of
producer
goods
this
is
at
first
sight
only
an
extraneous
change
in
the
material
forms
of
social
production
instead
of
a
quantity
of
means
of
subsistence
a
quantity
of
armaments
is
now
being
produced
capital
has
won
with
the
left
hand
only
what
it
has
lost
with
the
right
or
we
might
say
that
the
large
number
of
capitalists
producing
means
of
subsistence
have
lost
the
effective
demand
in
favour
of
a
small
group
of
big
armament
manufacturers
but
this
picture
is
only
valid
for
individual
capital
here
it
makes
no
difference
indeed
whether
production
engages
in
one
sphere
of
activity
or
another
as
far
as
the
individual
capitalist
is
concerned
there
are
no
departments
of
total
production
such
as
the
diagram
distinguishes
there
are
only
commodities
and
buyers
and
it
is
completely
immaterial
to
him
whether
he
produces
instruments
of
life
or
instruments
of
death
corned
beef
or
armour
plating
opponents
of
militarism
frequently
appeal
to
this
point
of
view
to
show
that
military
supplies
as
an
economic
investment
for
capital
merely
put
profit
taken
from
one
capitalist
into
the
pocket
of
another
on
the
other
hand
capital
and
its
advocates
try
to
overpersuade
the
working
class
to
this
point
of
view
by
talking
them
into
the
belief
that
indirect
taxes
and
the
demand
of
the
state
would
only
bring
about
a
change
in
the
material
form
of
reproduction
instead
of
other
commodities
cruisers
and
guns
would
be
produced
which
would
give
the
workers
as
good
a
living
if
not
a
better
one
one
glance
at
the
diagram
shows
how
little
truth
there
is
in
this
argument
as
far
as
the
workers
are
concerned
to
make
comparison
easier
we
will
suppose
the
armament
factories
to
employ
just
as
many
workers
as
were
employed
before
in
the
production
of
means
of
subsistence
for
the
working
class
units
will
then
be
paid
out
as
wages
but
now
they
will
only
buy
worth
of
means
of
subsistence
all
this
looks
different
from
the
perspective
of
capital
as
a
whole
for
this
the
at
the
disposal
of
the
state
which
represent
the
demand
for
armaments
constitute
a
new
market
originally
this
money
was
variable
capital
and
as
such
it
has
done
its
job
it
has
been
exchanged
for
living
labour
which
produced
the
surplus
value
but
then
the
circulation
of
the
variable
capital
was
stopped
short
this
money
was
split
off
and
it
now
appears
as
a
new
purchasing
power
in
the
possession
of
the
state
it
has
been
created
by
sleight
of
hand
as
it
were
but
still
it
has
the
same
effects
as
a
newly
opened
market
of
course
for
the
time
being
capital
is
debarred
from
selling
units
of
consumer
goods
for
the
working
class
and
the
individual
capitalist
considers
the
worker
just
as
good
a
consumer
and
buyer
of
commodities
as
anyone
else
another
capitalist
the
state
the
peasant
foreign
countries
etc
but
let
us
not
forget
that
for
capital
as
a
whole
the
upkeep
of
the
working
class
is
only
a
necessary
evil
only
a
means
towards
the
real
end
of
production
the
creation
and
realisation
of
surplus
value
if
it
were
possible
to
extort
surplus
value
without
giving
labour
an
equal
measure
of
means
of
subsistence
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
business
to
begin
with
indirect
taxation
has
the
same
effects
as
if
the
price
of
foodstuffs
remaining
constant
the
capitalists
had
succeeded
in
depressing
wages
by
a
hundred
units
without
detracting
from
the
work
performed
seeing
that
a
lower
output
of
consumer
goods
is
equally
the
inevitable
result
of
continuous
wage
cuts
if
wages
are
cut
heavily
capital
does
not
worry
about
having
to
produce
fewer
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
in
fact
it
delights
in
this
practice
at
every
opportunity
similarly
capital
as
a
whole
does
not
mind
if
the
effective
demand
of
the
working
class
for
means
of
subsistence
is
curtailed
because
of
indirect
taxation
which
is
not
compensated
by
a
rise
in
wages
this
may
seem
strange
because
in
the
latter
case
the
balance
of
the
variable
capital
goes
to
the
exchequer
while
with
a
direct
wage
cut
it
remains
in
the
capitalists
pockets
and
commodity
prices
remaining
equal
increases
the
relative
surplus
value
but
a
continuous
and
universal
reduction
of
money
wages
can
only
be
carried
through
on
rare
occasions
especially
if
trade
union
organisation
is
highly
developed
there
are
strong
social
and
political
barriers
to
this
fond
aspiration
of
capital
depression
of
the
real
wage
by
means
of
indirect
taxation
on
the
other
hand
can
be
carried
through
promptly
smoothly
and
universally
and
it
usually
takes
time
for
protests
to
be
heard
and
besides
the
opposition
is
confined
to
the
political
field
and
has
no
immediate
economic
repercussions
the
subsequent
restriction
in
the
production
of
means
of
subsistence
does
not
represent
a
loss
of
markets
for
capital
as
a
whole
but
rather
a
saving
in
the
costs
of
producing
surplus
value
surplus
value
is
never
realised
by
producing
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
however
necessary
this
may
be
as
the
reproduction
of
living
labour
for
the
production
of
surplus
value
but
to
come
back
to
our
example
i
means
of
production
ii
means
of
subsistence
at
first
it
looks
as
if
department
ii
were
also
creating
and
realising
surplus
value
in
the
process
of
producing
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
and
department
i
by
producing
the
requisite
means
of
production
but
if
we
take
the
social
product
as
a
whole
the
illusion
disappears
the
equation
is
in
that
case
now
if
the
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
are
cut
by
units
the
corresponding
contraction
of
both
departments
will
give
us
the
following
equations
i
ii
and
for
the
social
product
as
a
whole
this
looks
like
a
general
decrease
in
both
the
total
volume
of
production
and
in
the
production
of
surplus
value
but
only
if
we
contemplate
just
the
abstract
quantities
of
value
in
the
composition
of
the
total
product
it
does
not
hold
good
for
the
material
composition
thereof
looking
closer
we
find
that
nothing
but
the
upkeep
of
labour
is
in
effect
decreased
fewer
means
of
subsistence
and
production
are
now
being
made
no
doubt
but
then
they
had
had
no
other
function
save
to
maintain
workers
the
social
product
is
smaller
and
less
capital
is
now
employed
but
then
the
object
of
capitalist
production
is
not
simply
to
employ
as
much
capital
as
possible
but
to
produce
as
much
surplus
value
as
possible
capital
has
only
decreased
because
a
smaller
amount
is
sufficient
for
maintaining
the
workers
if
the
total
cost
of
maintaining
the
workers
employed
in
the
society
came
to
units
in
the
first
instance
the
present
decrease
of
the
social
product
by
the
difference
of
comes
off
this
maintenance
charge
and
there
is
a
consequent
change
in
the
composition
of
the
social
product
constant
capital
and
surplus
value
remain
unchanged
and
only
the
variable
capital
paid
labour
has
diminished
or
in
case
there
are
doubts
about
constant
capital
being
unaffected
we
may
further
allow
for
the
event
that
as
would
happen
in
actual
practice
concomitant
with
the
decrease
in
means
of
subsistence
for
the
workers
there
will
be
a
corresponding
cut
in
the
constant
capital
the
equation
for
the
social
product
as
a
whole
would
then
be
in
spite
of
the
smaller
social
product
there
is
no
change
in
the
surplus
value
in
either
case
and
it
is
only
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
workers
that
has
fallen
put
it
this
way
the
value
of
the
aggregate
social
product
may
be
defined
as
consisting
of
three
parts
the
total
constant
capital
of
the
society
its
total
variable
capital
and
its
total
surplus
value
of
which
the
first
set
of
products
contains
no
additional
labour
and
the
second
and
third
no
means
of
production
as
regards
their
material
form
all
these
products
come
into
being
in
the
given
period
of
production
though
in
point
of
value
the
constant
capital
had
been
produced
in
a
previous
period
and
is
merely
being
transferred
to
new
products
on
this
basis
we
can
also
divide
all
the
workers
employed
into
three
mutually
exclusive
categories
those
who
produce
the
aggregate
constant
capital
of
the
society
those
who
provide
the
upkeep
for
all
the
workers
and
finally
those
who
create
the
entire
surplus
value
for
the
capitalist
class
if
then
the
workers
consumption
is
curtailed
only
workers
in
the
second
category
will
lose
their
jobs
these
workers
had
never
created
surplus
value
for
capital
and
in
consequence
their
dismissal
is
therefore
no
loss
from
the
capitalist
point
of
view
but
a
gain
since
it
decreases
the
cost
of
producing
surplus
value
the
demand
of
the
state
which
arises
at
the
same
time
has
the
lure
of
a
new
and
attractive
sphere
for
realising
the
surplus
value
some
of
the
money
circulating
as
variable
capital
breaks
free
of
this
cycle
and
in
the
state
treasury
it
represents
a
new
demand
for
the
technique
of
taxation
of
course
the
order
of
events
is
rather
different
since
the
amount
of
the
indirect
taxes
is
actually
advanced
to
the
state
by
capital
and
is
merely
being
refunded
to
the
capitalists
by
the
sale
of
their
commodities
as
part
of
their
price
but
economically
speaking
it
makes
no
difference
the
crucial
point
is
that
the
quantity
of
money
with
the
function
of
variable
capital
should
first
mediate
the
exchange
between
capital
and
labour
power
later
when
there
is
an
exchange
between
workers
and
capitalists
as
buyers
and
sellers
of
commodities
respectively
this
money
will
change
hands
and
accrue
to
the
state
as
taxes
this
money
which
capital
has
set
circulating
first
fulfils
its
primary
function
in
the
exchange
with
labour
power
but
subsequently
by
mediation
of
the
state
it
begins
an
entirely
new
career
as
a
new
purchasing
power
belonging
with
neither
labour
nor
capital
it
becomes
interested
in
new
products
in
a
special
branch
of
production
which
does
not
cater
for
either
the
capitalists
or
the
working
class
and
thus
it
offers
capital
new
opportunities
for
creating
and
realising
surplus
value
when
we
were
formerly
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
indirect
taxes
extorted
from
the
workers
are
used
for
paying
the
officials
and
for
provisioning
the
army
we
found
the
in
the
consumption
of
the
working
class
to
mean
that
the
workers
rather
than
the
capitalists
were
made
to
pay
for
the
personal
consumption
of
the
of
the
capitalist
class
and
the
tools
of
their
this
charge
devolved
from
the
surplus
value
to
the
variable
capital
and
a
corresponding
amount
of
the
surplus
value
became
available
for
purposes
of
capitalisation
now
we
see
how
the
taxes
extorted
from
the
workers
afford
capital
a
new
opportunity
for
accumulation
when
they
are
used
for
armament
manufacture
on
the
basis
of
indirect
taxation
militarism
in
practice
works
both
ways
by
lowering
the
normal
standard
of
living
for
the
working
class
it
ensures
both
that
capital
should
be
able
to
maintain
a
regular
army
the
organ
of
capitalist
rule
and
that
it
may
tap
an
impressive
field
for
further
accumulation
we
have
still
to
examine
the
second
source
of
the
state
purchasing
power
referred
to
in
our
example
the
units
out
of
the
total
invested
in
armaments
they
differ
essentially
from
the
hundred
units
considered
above
in
that
they
are
not
supplied
by
the
workers
but
by
the
petty
bourgeoisie
the
artisans
and
peasants
in
this
connection
we
can
ignore
the
comparatively
small
of
the
capitalist
class
itself
the
money
accruing
to
the
state
as
taxes
from
the
peasant
masses
as
our
generic
term
for
all
consumers
was
not
originally
advanced
by
capital
and
has
not
split
off
from
capital
in
circulation
in
the
hand
of
the
peasant
it
is
the
equivalent
of
goods
that
have
been
realised
the
exchange
value
of
simple
commodity
production
the
state
now
gets
part
of
the
purchasing
power
of
the
consumers
purchasing
power
that
is
to
say
which
is
already
free
to
realise
the
surplus
value
for
capitalist
accumulation
now
the
question
arises
whether
economic
changes
will
result
for
capital
and
if
so
of
what
nature
from
diverting
the
purchasing
power
of
such
strata
to
the
state
for
militarist
purposes
it
almost
looks
as
if
we
had
come
up
against
yet
another
shift
in
the
material
form
of
reproduction
capital
will
now
produce
an
equivalent
of
war
materials
for
the
state
instead
of
producing
large
quantities
of
means
of
production
and
subsistence
for
peasant
consumers
but
in
fact
the
changes
go
deeper
first
and
foremost
the
state
can
use
the
mechanism
of
taxation
to
mobilise
much
larger
amounts
of
purchasing
power
from
the
consumers
than
they
would
ordinarily
spend
on
their
own
consumption
indeed
the
modern
system
of
taxation
itself
is
largely
responsible
for
forcing
commodity
economy
on
the
peasants
under
pressure
of
taxes
the
peasant
must
turn
more
and
more
of
his
produce
into
commodities
and
at
the
same
time
he
must
buy
more
and
more
taxation
presses
the
produce
of
peasant
economy
into
circulation
and
compels
the
peasants
to
become
buyers
of
capitalist
products
finally
on
a
basis
of
commodity
production
in
the
peasant
style
the
system
of
taxation
lures
more
purchasing
power
from
peasant
economy
than
would
otherwise
become
active
what
would
normally
have
been
hoarded
by
the
peasants
and
the
lower
middle
classes
until
it
has
grown
big
enough
to
invest
in
savings
banks
and
other
banks
is
now
set
free
to
constitute
an
effective
demand
and
an
opportunity
for
investment
further
the
multitude
of
individual
and
insignificant
demands
for
a
whole
range
of
commodities
which
will
become
effective
at
different
times
and
which
might
often
be
met
just
as
well
by
simple
commodity
production
is
now
replaced
by
a
comprehensive
and
homogeneous
demand
of
the
state
and
the
satisfaction
of
this
demand
presupposes
a
big
industry
of
the
highest
order
it
requires
the
most
favourable
conditions
for
the
production
of
surplus
value
and
for
accumulation
in
the
form
of
government
contracts
for
army
supplies
the
scattered
purchasing
power
of
the
consumers
is
concentrated
in
large
quantities
and
free
of
the
vagaries
and
subjective
fluctuations
of
personal
consumption
it
achieves
an
almost
automatic
regularity
and
rhythmic
growth
capital
itself
ultimately
controls
this
automatic
and
rhythmic
movement
of
militarist
production
through
the
legislature
and
a
press
whose
function
is
to
mould
opinion
that
is
why
this
particular
province
of
capitalist
accumulation
at
first
seems
capable
of
infinite
expansion
all
other
attempts
to
expand
markets
and
set
up
operational
bases
for
capital
largely
depend
on
historical
social
and
political
factors
beyond
the
control
of
capital
whereas
production
for
militarism
represents
a
province
whose
regular
and
progressive
expansion
seems
primarily
determined
by
capital
itself
in
this
way
capital
turns
historical
necessity
into
a
virtue
the
ever
fiercer
competition
in
the
capitalist
world
itself
provides
a
field
for
accumulation
of
the
first
magnitude
capital
increasingly
employs
militarism
for
implementing
a
foreign
and
colonial
policy
to
get
hold
of
the
means
of
production
and
labour
power
of
countries
and
societies
this
same
militarism
works
in
a
like
manner
in
the
capitalist
countries
to
divert
purchasing
power
away
from
the
strata
the
representatives
of
simple
commodity
production
and
the
working
class
are
affected
alike
in
this
way
at
their
expense
the
accumulation
of
capital
is
raised
to
the
highest
power
by
robbing
the
one
of
their
productive
forces
and
by
depressing
the
other
standard
of
living
needless
to
say
after
a
certain
stage
the
conditions
for
the
accumulation
of
capital
both
at
home
and
abroad
turn
into
their
very
opposite
they
become
conditions
for
the
decline
of
capitalism
the
more
ruthlessly
capital
sets
about
the
destruction
of
strata
at
home
and
in
the
outside
world
the
more
it
lowers
the
standard
of
living
for
the
workers
as
a
whole
the
greater
also
is
the
change
in
the
history
of
capital
it
becomes
a
string
of
political
and
social
disasters
and
convulsions
and
under
these
conditions
punctuated
by
periodical
economic
catastrophes
or
crises
accumulation
can
go
on
no
longer
but
even
before
this
natural
economic
impasse
of
capital
own
creating
is
properly
reached
it
becomes
a
necessity
for
the
international
working
class
to
revolt
against
the
rule
of
capital
capitalism
is
the
first
mode
of
economy
with
the
weapon
of
propaganda
a
mode
which
tends
to
engulf
the
entire
globe
and
to
stamp
out
all
other
economies
tolerating
no
rival
at
its
side
yet
at
the
same
time
it
is
also
the
first
mode
of
economy
which
is
unable
to
exist
by
itself
which
needs
other
economic
systems
as
a
medium
and
soil
although
it
strives
to
become
universal
and
indeed
on
account
of
this
its
tendency
it
must
break
down
because
it
is
immanently
incapable
of
becoming
a
universal
form
of
production
in
its
living
history
it
is
a
contradiction
in
itself
and
its
movement
of
accumulation
provides
a
solution
to
the
conflict
and
aggravates
it
at
the
same
time
at
a
certain
stage
of
development
there
will
be
no
other
way
out
than
the
application
of
socialist
principles
the
aim
of
socialism
is
not
accumulation
but
the
satisfaction
of
toiling
humanity
wants
by
developing
the
productive
forces
of
the
entire
globe
and
so
we
find
that
socialism
is
by
its
very
nature
an
harmonious
and
universal
system
of
economy
footnotes
renner
indeed
makes
this
assumption
the
basis
of
his
treatise
on
taxation
particle
of
value
created
in
the
course
of
one
year
is
made
up
of
these
four
parts
profit
interest
rent
and
wages
and
annual
taxation
then
can
only
be
levied
upon
these
arbeitende
volk
und
die
vienna
though
renner
immediately
goes
on
to
mention
peasants
he
cursorily
dismisses
them
in
a
single
sentence
peasant
is
simultaneously
entrepreneur
worker
and
landowner
his
agricultural
proceeds
yield
him
wage
profit
and
rent
in
obviously
it
is
an
empty
abstraction
to
apply
simultaneously
all
the
categories
of
capitalist
production
to
the
peasantry
to
conceive
of
the
peasant
as
entrepreneur
wage
labourer
and
landlord
all
in
one
person
if
like
renner
we
want
to
put
the
peasant
into
a
single
category
his
peculiarity
for
economics
lies
in
the
very
fact
that
he
belongs
neither
to
the
class
of
capitalist
entrepreneurs
nor
to
that
of
the
wage
proletariat
that
he
is
not
a
representative
of
capitalism
at
all
but
of
simple
commodity
production
it
would
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
present
treatise
to
deal
with
cartels
and
trusts
as
specific
phenomena
of
the
imperialist
phase
they
are
due
to
the
internal
competitive
struggle
between
individual
capitalist
groups
for
a
monopoly
of
the
existing
spheres
for
accumulation
and
for
the
distribution
of
profits
in
a
reply
to
vorontsov
professor
manuilov
for
example
wrote
what
was
then
greatly
praised
by
the
russian
marxists
this
context
we
must
distinguish
strictly
between
a
group
of
entrepreneurs
producing
weapons
of
war
and
the
capitalist
class
as
a
whole
for
the
manufacturers
of
guns
rifles
and
other
war
materials
the
existence
of
militarism
is
no
doubt
profitable
and
indispensable
it
is
indeed
quite
possible
that
the
abolition
of
the
system
of
armed
peace
would
spell
ruin
for
krupp
the
point
at
issue
however
is
not
a
special
group
of
entrepreneurs
but
the
capitalists
as
a
class
capitalist
production
as
a
whole
in
this
connection
however
it
should
be
noted
that
the
burden
of
taxation
falls
chiefly
on
the
working
population
every
increase
of
this
burden
diminishes
the
purchasing
power
of
the
population
and
hence
the
demand
for
commodities
this
fact
is
taken
as
proof
that
militarism
under
the
aspect
of
armament
production
does
indeed
one
group
of
capitalists
but
at
the
same
time
it
injures
all
others
spelling
gain
on
the
one
hand
but
loss
on
the
journal
of
the
law
society
petersburg
no
and
capitalism
ultimately
the
deterioration
of
the
normal
conditions
under
which
labour
power
is
renewed
will
bring
about
a
deterioration
of
labour
itself
it
will
diminish
the
average
efficiency
and
productivity
of
labour
and
thus
jeopardise
the
conditions
for
the
production
of
surplus
value
but
capital
will
not
feel
these
results
for
a
long
time
and
so
they
do
not
immediately
enter
into
its
economic
calculations

in
so

they
bring
