my
little
boy
is
beginning
to
live
carefully
stumbling
now
and
then
on
his
little
legs
he
makes
his
way
over
the
looks
at
everything
that
there
is
to
look
at
and
bites
at
every
apple
both
those
which
are
his
due
and
those
which
are
forbidden
him
he
is
not
a
pretty
child
and
is
the
more
likely
to
grow
into
a
fine
lad
but
he
is
charming
his
face
can
light
up
suddenly
and
become
radiant
he
can
look
at
you
with
quite
cold
eyes
he
has
a
strong
intuition
and
he
is
incorruptible
he
has
never
yet
bartered
a
kiss
for
there
are
people
whom
he
likes
and
people
whom
he
dislikes
there
is
one
who
has
long
courted
his
favour
indefatigably
and
in
vain
and
the
other
day
he
formed
a
close
friendship
with
another
who
had
not
so
much
as
said
good
day
to
him
before
he
had
crept
into
her
lap
and
nestled
there
with
glowing
resolution
he
has
a
habit
which
i
love
when
we
are
walking
together
and
there
is
anything
that
impresses
him
he
lets
go
my
hand
for
a
moment
then
when
he
has
investigated
the
phenomenon
and
arrived
at
a
result
i
feel
his
little
fist
in
mine
again
he
has
bad
habits
too
he
is
apt
for
instance
suddenly
and
without
the
slightest
reason
to
go
up
to
people
whom
he
meets
in
the
street
and
hit
them
with
his
little
stick
what
is
in
his
mind
when
he
does
so
i
do
not
know
and
so
long
as
he
does
not
hit
me
it
remains
a
matter
between
himself
and
the
people
concerned
he
has
an
odd
trick
of
seizing
big
words
in
a
conversation
storing
them
up
for
a
while
and
then
asking
me
for
an
explanation
father
he
says
what
is
life
i
give
him
a
tap
in
his
little
stomach
roll
him
over
on
the
carpet
and
conceal
my
emotion
under
a
mighty
romp
then
when
we
sit
breathless
and
tired
i
answer
gravely
life
is
delightful
my
little
boy
do
you
be
afraid
of
it
ii
today
my
little
boy
gave
me
my
first
lesson
it
was
in
the
garden
i
was
writing
in
the
shade
of
the
big
close
to
where
the
brook
flows
past
he
was
sitting
a
little
way
off
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
with
hans
christian
andersen
in
his
lap
of
course
he
does
not
know
how
to
read
but
he
lets
you
read
to
him
likes
to
hear
the
same
tales
over
and
over
again
the
better
he
knows
them
the
better
he
is
pleased
he
follows
the
story
page
by
page
knows
exactly
where
everything
comes
and
catches
you
up
immediately
should
you
skip
a
line
there
are
two
tales
which
he
loves
more
than
anything
in
the
world
these
are
grimm
and
andersen
little
when
anyone
comes
whom
he
likes
he
fetches
the
big
grimm
with
those
heaps
of
pictures
and
asks
for
then
if
the
reader
stops
because
it
is
so
terribly
sad
with
all
those
little
dead
children
a
bright
smile
lights
up
his
small
long
face
and
he
says
reassuringly
and
pleased
at
knowing
better
yes
but
they
come
to
life
again
today
however
it
is
little
is
that
the
sort
of
stories
you
write
he
asks
yes
i
say
but
i
am
afraid
mine
will
not
be
so
pretty
you
must
take
pains
he
says
and
i
promise
for
a
time
he
makes
no
sound
i
go
on
writing
and
forget
about
him
is
there
a
little
mermaid
down
there
in
the
water
he
asks
yes
she
swims
up
to
the
top
in
the
summer
he
nods
and
looks
out
across
the
brook
which
ripples
so
softly
and
smoothly
that
one
can
hardly
see
the
water
flow
on
the
opposite
side
the
rushes
grow
green
and
thick
and
there
is
also
a
bird
hidden
in
the
rushes
which
sings
the
are
whirling
and
humming
i
am
sitting
with
my
head
in
my
hand
absorbed
in
my
work
suddenly
i
hear
a
splash
i
jump
from
my
chair
upset
the
table
dart
forward
and
see
that
my
little
boy
is
gone
the
brook
is
billowing
and
foaming
there
are
wide
circles
on
the
surface
in
a
moment
i
am
in
the
water
and
find
him
and
catch
hold
of
him
he
stands
on
the
grass
dripping
with
wet
spluttering
and
coughing
his
thin
clothes
are
clinging
to
his
thin
body
his
face
is
black
with
mud
but
out
of
the
mud
gleams
a
pair
of
angry
eyes
there
was
no
mermaid
he
says
i
do
not
at
once
know
what
to
reply
and
i
have
no
time
to
think
do
you
write
that
sort
of
stories
he
asks
yes
i
say
shamefaced
i
do
like
any
of
you
he
says
you
make
fun
of
a
little
boy
he
turns
his
back
on
me
and
proud
and
wet
goes
indoors
without
once
looking
round
this
evening
grimm
and
hans
christian
andersen
disappear
in
a
mysterious
manner
which
is
never
explained
he
will
miss
them
greatly
at
first
but
he
will
never
be
fooled
again
not
if
i
were
to
give
him
the
sun
and
moon
in
his
hand
iii
my
little
boy
and
i
have
had
an
exceedingly
interesting
walk
in
the
frederiksberg
park
there
was
a
mouse
which
was
irresistible
there
were
two
chaffinches
husband
and
wife
which
built
their
nest
right
before
our
eyes
and
a
snail
which
had
no
secrets
for
us
and
there
were
flowers
yellow
and
white
and
there
were
green
leaves
which
told
us
the
oddest
adventures
in
fact
as
much
as
we
can
find
room
for
in
our
little
head
now
we
are
sitting
on
a
bench
and
digesting
our
impressions
suddenly
the
air
is
shaken
by
a
tremendous
roar
what
was
that
asks
my
little
boy
that
was
the
lion
in
the
zoological
gardens
i
reply
no
sooner
have
i
said
this
than
i
curse
my
own
stupidity
i
might
have
said
that
it
was
a
gunshot
announcing
the
birth
of
a
prince
or
an
earthquake
or
a
china
dish
falling
from
the
sky
and
breaking
into
pieces
anything
whatever
rather
than
the
truth
for
now
my
little
boy
wants
to
know
what
sort
of
thing
the
zoological
gardens
is
i
tell
him
the
zoological
gardens
is
a
horrid
place
where
they
lock
up
wild
beasts
who
have
done
no
wrong
and
who
are
accustomed
to
walk
about
freely
in
the
distant
foreign
countries
where
they
come
from
the
lion
is
there
whom
we
have
just
heard
roaring
he
is
so
strong
that
he
can
kill
a
policeman
with
one
blow
of
his
paw
he
has
great
haughty
eyes
and
awfully
sharp
teeth
he
lives
in
africa
and
at
night
when
he
roars
all
the
other
beasts
tremble
in
their
holes
for
fear
he
is
called
the
king
of
beasts
they
caught
him
one
day
in
a
cunning
trap
and
bound
him
and
dragged
him
here
and
locked
him
up
in
a
cage
with
iron
bars
to
it
the
cage
is
no
more
than
half
as
big
as
petrine
room
and
there
the
king
walks
up
and
down
up
and
down
and
gnashes
his
teeth
with
sorrow
and
rage
and
roars
so
that
you
can
hear
him
ever
so
far
away
outside
his
cage
stand
cowardly
people
and
laugh
at
him
because
he
ca
get
out
and
eat
them
up
and
poke
their
sticks
through
the
rails
and
tease
him
my
little
boy
stands
in
front
of
me
and
looks
at
me
with
eyes
would
he
eat
them
up
if
he
got
out
he
asks
in
a
moment
but
he
ca
get
out
can
he
no
that
awfully
sad
he
ca
get
out
father
let
us
go
and
look
at
the
lion
i
pretend
not
to
hear
and
go
on
to
tell
him
of
the
strange
birds
there
great
eagles
which
used
to
fly
over
every
and
over
the
highest
trees
and
mountains
and
swoop
down
upon
lambs
and
hares
and
carry
them
up
to
their
young
in
the
nest
now
they
are
sitting
in
cages
on
a
perch
like
canaries
with
clipped
wings
and
blind
eyes
i
tell
him
of
gulls
which
used
to
fly
all
day
long
over
the
stormy
sea
now
they
splash
about
in
a
puddle
of
water
screaming
pitifully
i
tell
him
of
wonderful
blue
and
red
birds
which
in
their
youth
used
to
live
among
wonderful
blue
and
red
flowers
in
balmy
forests
a
thousand
times
bigger
than
the
frederiksberg
park
where
it
was
as
dark
as
night
under
the
trees
with
the
brightest
sun
shining
down
upon
the
now
they
sit
there
in
very
small
cages
and
hang
their
beaks
while
they
stare
at
tiresome
boys
in
suits
and
black
stockings
and
waterproof
boots
and
are
those
birds
really
blue
asks
my
little
boy
i
answer
and
utterly
father
ca
we
go
and
look
at
the
birds
i
take
my
little
boy
hands
in
mine
i
do
think
we
will
i
say
why
should
still
more
silly
boys
do
so
you
ca
imagine
how
it
goes
to
one
heart
to
look
at
those
poor
captive
beasts
father
i
should
so
much
like
to
go
take
my
advice
and
do
the
animals
there
are
not
the
real
animals
you
see
they
are
ill
and
ugly
and
angry
because
of
their
captivity
and
their
longing
and
their
pain
i
should
so
much
like
to
see
them
now
let
me
tell
you
something
to
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
costs
five
cents
for
you
and
ten
cents
for
me
that
makes
fifteen
cents
altogether
which
is
an
awful
lot
of
money
we
wo
go
there
now
but
we
buy
the
biggest
we
can
find
one
of
those
shaped
like
a
pig
then
we
put
fifteen
cents
in
it
and
every
thursday
we
put
fifteen
cents
in
the
pig
that
will
grow
into
quite
a
fortune
it
will
make
such
a
lot
of
money
that
when
you
are
grown
up
you
can
take
a
trip
to
africa
and
go
to
the
desert
and
hear
the
wild
the
real
lion
roaring
and
tremble
just
like
the
people
tremble
down
there
and
you
can
go
to
the
great
dark
forests
and
see
the
real
blue
birds
flying
proud
and
free
among
the
flowers
you
think
how
glad
you
will
be
how
beautiful
they
will
look
and
how
they
will
sing
to
you
father
i
would
rather
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
now
my
little
boy
does
not
understand
a
word
of
what
i
say
and
i
am
at
my
wits
end
shall
we
go
and
have
some
cakes
at
josty
i
ask
i
would
rather
go
to
the
zoological
gardens
i
can
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
thinking
of
the
captive
lion
ugly
human
instincts
are
waking
up
in
his
soul
the
mouse
is
forgotten
and
the
snail
and
the
chaffinches
have
built
their
nest
to
no
purpose
at
last
i
get
up
and
say
bluntly
without
any
further
explanation
you
are
going
to
the
zoological
gardens
now
we
go
home
and
home
we
go
but
we
are
not
in
a
good
temper
of
course
i
get
over
it
and
i
buy
an
enormous
pig
also
we
put
the
money
into
it
and
he
thinks
that
most
interesting
but
later
in
the
afternoon
i
find
him
in
the
engaged
in
a
piteous
game
he
has
built
a
cage
in
which
he
has
imprisoned
the
pig
he
is
teasing
it
and
hitting
it
with
his
whip
while
he
keeps
shouting
to
it
you
ca
get
out
and
bite
me
you
stupid
pig
you
ca
get
out
iv
we
have
and
aunt
anna
to
dinner
now
is
a
nasty
dish
and
aunt
anna
is
not
very
nice
either
she
has
yellow
teeth
and
a
little
hump
and
very
severe
eyes
which
are
not
even
both
equally
severe
she
is
nearly
always
scolding
us
and
when
she
sees
a
chance
she
pinches
us
the
worst
of
all
however
is
that
she
is
constantly
setting
us
a
good
example
which
can
easily
end
by
gradually
and
inevitably
driving
us
to
embrace
wickedness
aunt
anna
does
not
like
any
more
than
we
do
but
of
course
she
eats
it
with
a
voluptuous
expression
on
her
face
and
looks
angrily
at
my
little
boy
who
does
not
even
make
an
attempt
to
behave
nicely
why
does
the
little
boy
eat
his
delicious
she
asks
a
scornful
silence
such
delicious
i
know
a
poor
wretched
boy
who
would
be
awfully
glad
to
have
such
delicious
my
little
boy
looks
with
great
interest
at
auntie
who
is
swallowing
her
soup
with
eyes
full
of
ecstatic
bliss
where
is
he
he
asks
aunt
anna
pretends
not
to
hear
where
is
the
poor
boy
he
asks
again
yes
where
is
he
i
ask
what
his
name
aunt
anna
gives
me
a
furious
glance
what
his
name
aunt
anna
asks
my
little
boy
where
does
he
live
he
can
have
my
with
pleasure
mine
too
i
say
resolutely
and
i
push
my
plate
from
me
my
little
boy
never
takes
his
great
eyes
off
aunt
anna
face
meanwhile
she
has
recovered
herself
there
are
many
poor
boys
who
would
thank
god
if
they
could
get
such
delicious
she
says
very
many
everywhere
yes
but
tell
us
of
one
auntie
i
say
my
little
boy
has
slipped
down
from
his
chair
he
stands
with
his
chin
just
above
the
table
and
both
his
hands
round
his
plate
ready
to
march
off
with
the
to
the
poor
boy
if
only
he
can
get
his
address
but
aunt
anna
does
not
allow
herself
to
be
played
with
heaps
of
poor
boys
she
says
again
and
therefore
another
little
boy
whom
i
will
not
name
but
who
is
in
this
room
ought
to
be
ashamed
that
he
is
not
thankful
for
his
my
little
boy
stares
at
aunt
anna
like
the
bird
fascinated
by
the
snake
such
delicious
she
says
i
must
really
ask
for
another
little
helping
aunt
anna
revels
in
her
martyrdom
my
little
boy
stands
speechless
with
open
mouth
and
round
eyes
i
push
my
chair
back
and
say
with
genuine
exasperation
now
look
here
aunt
anna
this
is
really
too
bad
here
we
are
with
a
whole
lot
of
which
we
do
care
about
in
the
least
and
which
we
would
be
very
glad
to
get
rid
of
if
we
only
knew
someone
who
would
have
it
you
are
the
only
one
that
knows
of
anybody
you
know
a
poor
boy
who
would
dance
for
joy
if
he
got
some
you
know
hundreds
but
you
wo
tell
us
their
names
or
where
they
live
why
what
do
you
mean
and
you
yourself
sit
quite
calmly
eating
two
whole
helpings
though
you
know
quite
well
that
you
going
to
have
an
omelette
to
follow
really
very
naughty
of
you
aunt
anna
aunt
anna
chokes
with
annoyance
my
little
boy
locks
his
teeth
with
a
snap
and
looks
with
every
mark
of
disgust
at
that
wicked
old
woman
and
i
turn
with
calm
earnestness
to
his
mother
and
say
after
this
it
would
be
most
improper
for
us
ever
to
have
here
again
we
do
care
for
it
and
there
are
hundreds
of
little
boys
who
love
it
if
it
must
be
made
then
aunt
anna
must
come
every
saturday
and
fetch
it
she
knows
where
the
boys
live
the
omelette
is
eaten
in
silence
after
which
aunt
anna
shakes
the
dust
from
her
shoes
she
wo
have
any
coffee
today
while
she
is
standing
in
the
hall
and
putting
on
her
endless
wraps
a
last
doubt
arises
in
my
little
boy
soul
he
opens
his
green
eyes
wide
before
her
face
and
whispers
aunt
anna
where
do
the
boys
live
aunt
anna
pinches
him
and
is
shocked
and
goes
off
having
suffered
a
greater
defeat
than
she
can
ever
repair
v
my
little
boy
comes
into
my
room
and
tells
me
with
a
very
long
face
that
jean
is
dead
and
we
put
all
nonsense
on
one
side
and
hurry
away
to
the
klampenborg
train
to
go
where
jean
is
for
jean
is
the
biggest
dog
that
has
lived
for
some
time
he
once
bit
a
boy
so
hard
that
the
boy
still
walks
lame
he
once
bit
his
own
master
he
could
give
such
a
look
out
of
his
eyes
and
open
such
a
mouth
that
there
was
no
more
horrible
sight
in
the
world
and
then
he
would
be
the
mildest
of
the
mild
my
little
boy
could
put
his
hand
in
his
mouth
and
ride
on
his
back
and
pull
his
tail
when
we
get
there
we
hear
that
jean
is
already
buried
we
look
at
each
other
in
dismay
to
think
how
quickly
that
happens
and
we
go
to
the
grave
which
is
in
the
grounds
of
the
factory
where
the
tall
chimneys
stand
we
sit
down
and
ca
understand
it
we
tell
each
other
all
the
stories
that
we
know
of
jean
wonderful
size
and
strength
the
one
remembers
this
the
other
that
and
as
each
story
is
told
the
whole
thing
becomes
only
more
awful
and
obscure
at
last
we
go
home
by
train
besides
ourselves
there
is
a
kind
old
gentleman
in
the
compartment
who
would
like
to
make
friends
with
my
little
boy
but
the
boy
has
nothing
to
talk
about
to
the
kind
old
gentleman
he
stands
at
the
window
which
comes
just
under
his
chin
and
stares
out
his
eyes
light
upon
some
tall
chimneys
that
where
jean
is
buried
he
says
yes
the
landscape
flies
past
he
can
think
only
of
and
see
only
and
when
some
more
chimneys
appear
he
says
again
that
where
jean
is
buried
no
my
little
friend
says
the
kind
old
gentleman
that
was
over
there
the
boy
looks
at
him
with
surprise
i
hasten
to
reassure
him
those
jean
chimneys
i
say
and
while
he
is
looking
out
again
i
take
the
old
gentleman
to
the
further
corner
of
the
compartment
and
tell
him
the
state
of
the
case
i
tell
him
that
if
i
live
i
hope
in
years
to
come
to
explain
to
the
boy
the
difference
between
petersen
and
hansen
factories
and
should
i
die
i
will
confidently
leave
that
part
of
his
education
to
others
yes
even
if
he
should
never
learn
this
difference
i
would
still
be
resigned
today
it
is
a
question
of
other
and
more
important
matters
the
strongest
the
most
living
thing
he
knew
is
dead
really
says
the
old
gentleman
sympathetically
a
relation
perhaps
yes
i
say
jean
is
dead
a
dog
a
dog
it
is
not
because
of
the
do
you
understand
but
of
which
he
sees
for
the
first
time
death
with
all
its
might
its
mystery
father
says
my
little
boy
and
turns
his
head
towards
us
when
do
we
die
when
we
grow
old
says
the
kind
old
gentleman
no
says
the
boy
einar
has
a
brother
at
home
in
the
courtyard
and
he
is
dead
and
he
was
only
a
little
boy
then
einar
brother
was
so
good
and
learnt
such
a
lot
that
he
was
already
fit
to
go
to
heaven
says
the
old
gentleman
mind
you
do
become
too
good
i
say
and
laugh
and
tap
my
little
boy
in
the
stomach
and
my
little
boy
laughs
too
and
goes
back
to
his
window
where
new
chimneys
rise
over
jean
grave
but
i
take
the
old
gentleman
by
the
shoulders
and
forbid
him
most
strictly
to
talk
to
my
little
boy
again
i
give
up
trying
to
make
him
understand
me
i
just
shake
him
he
eyes
the
and
when
we
reach
the
station
hurries
away
i
go
with
my
little
boy
holding
his
hand
through
the
streets
full
of
live
people
in
the
evening
i
sit
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
talk
with
him
about
that
incomprehensible
thing
jean
who
is
dead
jean
who
was
so
much
alive
so
strong
so
big
vi
our
courtyard
is
full
of
children
and
my
little
boy
has
picked
a
out
of
the
band
his
name
is
einar
and
he
can
be
as
good
as
another
my
little
boy
admires
him
and
einar
allows
himself
to
be
admired
so
that
the
friendship
is
established
on
the
only
proper
basis
einar
says
einar
thinks
einar
does
is
the
daily
refrain
and
we
arrange
our
little
life
accordingly
i
ca
see
anything
out
of
the
way
in
einar
says
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
nor
can
i
say
i
but
our
little
boy
can
and
that
is
enough
i
once
had
a
friend
who
could
see
nothing
at
all
charming
in
you
and
you
yourself
if
i
remember
right
had
three
friends
who
thought
taste
inexcusable
luckily
for
our
little
boy
luckily
it
is
the
feeling
that
counts
i
go
on
lecturing
and
not
the
object
thanks
she
says
now
something
big
and
unusual
takes
place
in
our
courtyard
and
makes
an
extraordinary
impression
on
the
children
and
gives
their
small
brains
heaps
to
struggle
with
for
many
a
long
day
the
scarlatina
comes
and
scarlatina
is
not
like
a
pain
in
your
stomach
when
you
have
eaten
too
many
pears
or
like
a
cold
when
you
have
forgotten
to
put
on
your
jacket
scarlatina
is
something
quite
different
something
powerful
and
terrible
it
comes
at
night
and
takes
a
little
boy
who
was
playing
quite
happily
that
same
evening
and
then
the
little
boy
is
gone
perhaps
a
funny
carriage
comes
driving
in
through
the
gate
with
two
horses
and
a
coachman
and
two
men
with
bright
brass
buttons
on
their
coats
the
two
men
take
out
of
the
carriage
a
basket
with
a
red
blanket
and
white
sheets
and
carry
it
up
to
where
the
boy
lives
presently
they
carry
the
basket
down
again
and
then
the
boy
is
inside
but
nobody
can
see
him
because
the
sheet
is
over
his
face
the
basket
is
shoved
into
the
carriage
which
is
shut
with
a
bang
and
away
goes
the
carriage
with
the
boy
while
his
mother
dries
her
eyes
and
goes
up
to
the
others
perhaps
no
carriage
comes
but
then
the
sick
boy
is
shut
up
in
his
room
and
no
one
may
go
to
him
for
a
long
time
because
he
is
infectious
and
anyone
can
understand
that
this
must
be
terribly
sad
the
children
in
the
courtyard
talk
of
nothing
else
they
talk
with
soft
voices
and
faces
full
of
mystery
because
they
know
nothing
for
certain
they
hear
that
one
of
them
who
rode
away
in
the
carriage
is
dead
but
that
makes
no
more
impression
on
them
than
when
one
of
them
falls
ill
and
disappears
day
by
day
the
little
band
is
being
thinned
out
and
not
one
of
them
has
yet
come
back
i
stand
at
my
open
window
and
look
at
my
little
boy
who
is
sitting
on
the
steps
below
with
his
friend
they
have
their
arms
around
each
other
necks
and
see
no
one
except
each
other
that
is
to
say
einar
sees
himself
and
my
little
boy
sees
einar
if
you
fall
ill
i
will
come
and
see
you
says
my
little
boy
no
you
wo
i
will
come
and
see
you
his
eyes
beam
at
this
important
promise
einar
cries
as
though
he
were
already
and
the
next
day
he
is
ill
he
lies
in
a
little
room
all
by
himself
no
one
is
allowed
to
go
to
him
a
red
curtain
hangs
before
the
window
my
little
boy
sits
alone
on
the
steps
outside
and
stares
up
at
the
curtain
his
hands
are
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
he
does
not
care
to
play
and
he
speaks
to
nobody
and
i
walk
up
and
down
the
room
uneasy
as
to
what
will
come
next
you
are
anxious
about
our
little
boy
says
his
mother
and
it
will
be
a
miracle
if
he
escapes
it
not
that
we
all
had
a
touch
of
scarlatina
but
just
as
i
want
to
talk
to
her
about
it
i
hear
a
fumbling
with
the
which
there
is
no
mistaking
and
then
he
stands
before
us
in
the
room
i
know
you
so
well
my
little
boy
when
you
come
in
sideways
like
that
with
a
long
face
and
go
and
sit
in
a
corner
and
look
at
the
two
people
who
owe
so
much
happiness
to
you
look
from
one
to
the
other
your
eyes
are
greener
than
usual
you
ca
find
your
words
and
you
sit
huddled
up
and
you
are
ever
so
good
mother
is
einar
ill
yes
but
he
will
soon
be
better
again
the
doctor
says
that
he
is
not
so
bad
is
he
infectious
mother
yes
he
is
his
little
sister
has
been
sent
to
the
country
so
that
she
may
not
fall
ill
too
no
one
is
allowed
to
go
to
him
except
his
mother
who
gives
him
his
milk
and
his
medicine
and
makes
his
bed
a
silence
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
looks
down
at
her
book
and
suspects
nothing
the
father
of
my
little
boy
looks
in
great
suspense
from
the
window
mother
i
want
to
go
to
einar
you
ca
go
there
my
little
man
you
hear
he
infectious
just
think
if
you
should
fall
ill
yourself
einar
is
bothering
at
all
about
chatting
with
you
he
sleeps
the
whole
day
long
but
when
he
wakes
mother
you
ca
go
up
there
this
tells
upon
him
and
he
is
nearly
crying
i
see
that
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
come
to
his
rescue
have
you
promised
einar
to
go
and
see
him
i
ask
yes
father
he
is
over
his
trouble
his
eyes
beam
he
stands
erect
and
glad
beside
me
and
puts
his
little
hand
in
mine
then
of
course
you
must
do
so
i
say
calmly
so
soon
as
he
wakes
our
mother
closes
her
book
with
a
bang
go
down
to
the
courtyard
and
play
while
father
and
i
have
a
talk
the
boy
runs
away
and
she
comes
up
to
me
and
lays
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
says
earnestly
i
do
that
do
you
hear
and
i
take
her
hand
and
kiss
it
and
say
quite
as
earnestly
and
i
we
look
at
each
other
we
two
who
share
the
empire
the
power
and
the
glory
i
heard
our
little
boy
make
his
promise
i
say
i
saw
him
sir
galahad
himself
was
not
more
in
earnest
when
swearing
his
knightly
oath
you
see
we
have
no
choice
here
he
can
catch
the
scarlatina
in
any
case
and
it
is
not
even
certain
that
he
will
catch
it
if
it
was
diphtheria
you
would
talk
like
that
you
may
be
right
but
am
i
to
become
a
thief
for
the
sake
of
a
nickel
because
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
resist
the
temptation
to
steal
a
kingdom
you
would
not
find
a
living
being
to
agree
with
you
except
yourself
and
that
is
all
i
want
the
infection
is
really
only
a
side
matter
it
can
come
this
way
or
that
way
we
ca
safeguard
him
come
what
may
but
are
we
to
send
him
straight
to
where
it
is
we
not
doing
that
it
not
we
who
are
doing
that
she
is
very
much
excited
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
and
we
walk
up
and
down
the
room
together
darling
today
our
little
boy
may
meet
with
a
great
misfortune
he
may
receive
a
shock
from
which
he
will
never
recover
that
is
true
she
says
if
he
does
keep
his
promise
the
misfortune
has
occurred
it
would
already
be
a
misfortune
if
he
could
ever
think
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
break
it
if
it
appeared
to
him
that
there
was
anything
great
or
remarkable
about
keeping
it
yes
but
darling
the
world
is
full
of
careful
persons
one
step
more
and
they
become
mere
paltry
people
shall
we
turn
that
into
a
likely
thing
into
a
virtue
for
our
little
boy
his
promise
was
stupid
let
that
pass
he
is
so
little
yes
that
he
is
and
god
be
praised
for
it
think
what
good
luck
it
is
that
he
did
not
know
the
danger
when
he
made
his
promise
that
he
does
not
understand
it
now
when
he
is
keeping
it
what
a
lucky
beggar
he
is
learning
to
keep
his
word
just
as
he
has
learnt
to
be
clean
by
the
time
that
he
is
big
enough
to
know
his
danger
it
will
be
an
indispensable
habit
with
him
and
he
gains
all
that
at
the
risk
of
a
little
scarlatina
she
lays
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
says
nothing
more
that
afternoon
she
takes
our
little
boy
by
the
hand
and
goes
up
with
him
to
einar
they
stand
on
the
threshold
of
his
room
bid
him
and
ask
him
how
he
is
einar
is
not
at
all
well
and
does
not
look
up
and
does
not
answer
but
that
does
not
matter
in
the
least
vii
my
little
boy
is
given
a
cent
by
petrine
with
instructions
to
go
to
the
baker
and
buy
some
biscuits
by
that
which
fools
call
an
accident
but
which
is
really
a
divine
miracle
if
miracles
there
be
i
overhear
this
instruction
then
i
stand
at
my
window
and
see
him
cross
the
street
in
his
slow
way
and
with
bent
head
only
he
goes
slower
than
usual
and
with
his
head
bent
more
deeply
between
his
small
shoulders
he
stands
long
outside
the
baker
window
where
there
is
a
confused
heap
of
lollipops
and
chocolates
and
and
other
things
created
for
a
small
boy
delight
then
he
lifts
his
young
hand
opens
the
door
disappears
and
presently
returns
with
a
great
paper
bag
eating
with
all
his
might
and
i
who
heaven
be
praised
have
myself
been
a
thief
in
my
time
run
all
over
the
house
and
give
my
orders
my
little
boy
enters
the
kitchen
put
the
biscuits
on
the
table
says
petrine
he
stands
still
for
a
moment
and
looks
at
her
and
at
the
table
and
at
the
floor
then
he
goes
silently
to
his
mother
you
quite
a
big
boy
now
that
you
can
buy
biscuits
for
petrine
says
she
without
looking
up
from
her
work
his
face
is
very
long
but
he
says
nothing
he
comes
quietly
in
to
me
and
sits
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
you
have
been
over
the
way
at
the
baker
he
comes
up
to
me
where
i
am
sitting
and
reading
and
presses
himself
against
me
i
do
not
look
at
him
but
i
can
perceive
what
is
going
on
inside
him
what
did
you
buy
at
the
baker
lollipops
well
i
never
what
fun
why
you
had
some
lollipops
this
morning
who
gave
you
the
money
this
time
petrine
really
well
petrine
is
certainly
very
fond
of
you
do
you
remember
the
lovely
ball
she
gave
you
on
your
birthday
father
petrine
told
me
to
buy
a
cent
worth
of
biscuits
oh
dear
it
is
very
quiet
in
the
room
my
little
boy
cries
bitterly
and
i
look
anxiously
before
me
stroking
his
hair
the
while
now
you
have
fooled
petrine
badly
she
wants
those
biscuits
of
course
for
her
cooking
she
thinks
they
on
the
and
when
she
goes
to
look
she
wo
find
any
mother
gave
her
a
cent
for
biscuits
petrine
gave
you
a
cent
for
biscuits
and
you
go
and
spend
it
on
lollipops
what
are
we
to
do
he
looks
at
me
in
despair
holds
me
tight
says
a
thousand
things
without
speaking
a
word
if
only
we
had
a
cent
i
say
then
you
could
rush
over
the
way
and
fetch
the
biscuits
father
his
eyes
open
very
wide
and
he
speaks
so
softly
that
i
can
hardly
hear
him
there
is
a
cent
on
mother
is
there
i
cry
with
delight
but
at
the
same
moment
i
shake
my
head
and
my
face
is
overcast
again
that
is
no
use
to
us
my
little
boy
that
cent
belongs
to
mother
the
other
was
petrine
people
are
so
terribly
fond
of
their
money
and
get
so
angry
when
you
take
it
from
them
i
can
understand
that
for
you
can
buy
such
an
awful
lot
of
things
with
money
you
can
get
biscuits
and
lollipops
and
clothes
and
toys
and
half
the
things
in
the
world
and
it
is
not
so
easy
either
to
make
money
most
people
have
to
drudge
all
day
long
to
earn
as
much
as
they
want
so
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
get
angry
when
you
take
it
especially
when
it
is
only
for
lollipops
now
petrine
she
has
to
spend
the
whole
day
cleaning
rooms
and
cooking
dinner
and
washing
up
before
she
gets
her
wages
and
out
of
that
she
has
to
buy
clothes
and
shoes
and
you
know
that
she
has
a
little
girl
whom
she
has
to
pay
for
at
madam
olsen
she
must
certainly
have
saved
very
cleverly
before
she
managed
to
buy
you
that
ball
we
walk
up
and
down
the
room
hand
in
hand
he
keeps
on
falling
over
his
legs
for
he
ca
take
his
eyes
from
my
face
father
have
you
got
a
cent
i
shake
my
head
and
give
him
my
purse
look
for
yourself
i
say
there
not
a
cent
in
it
i
spent
the
last
this
morning
we
walk
up
and
down
we
sit
down
and
get
up
and
walk
about
again
we
are
very
gloomy
we
are
bowed
down
with
sorrow
and
look
at
each
other
in
great
perplexity
there
might
be
one
hidden
away
in
a
drawer
somewhere
i
say
we
fly
to
the
drawers
we
pull
out
thirty
drawers
and
rummage
through
them
we
fling
papers
in
disorder
on
the
floor
what
do
we
care
if
only
if
only
we
find
a
cent
hurrah
we
both
at
last
grasp
at
a
cent
as
though
we
would
fight
for
it
we
have
found
a
beautiful
large
cent
our
eyes
gleam
and
we
laugh
through
our
tears
hurry
now
i
whisper
you
can
go
this
way
through
my
door
then
run
back
quickly
up
the
kitchen
stairs
with
the
biscuits
and
put
them
on
the
table
i
shall
call
petrine
so
that
she
does
see
and
we
wo
tell
anybody
he
is
down
the
stairs
before
i
have
done
speaking
i
run
after
him
and
call
to
him
was
it
a
splendid
thing
that
we
found
that
cent
i
say
yes
he
answers
earnestly
and
he
laughs
for
happiness
and
i
laugh
too
and
his
legs
go
like
drumsticks
across
to
the
baker
from
my
window
i
see
him
come
back
at
the
same
pace
with
red
cheeks
and
glad
eyes
he
has
committed
his
first
crime
he
has
understood
it
and
he
has
not
the
sting
of
remorse
in
his
soul
nor
the
black
cockade
of
forgiveness
in
his
cap
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
and
i
sit
until
late
at
night
talking
about
money
which
seems
to
us
the
most
difficult
matter
of
all
for
our
little
boy
must
learn
to
know
the
power
of
money
and
the
glamour
of
money
and
the
joy
of
money
he
must
earn
much
money
and
spend
much
money
yet
there
were
two
people
yesterday
who
killed
a
man
to
rob
him
of
four
dollars
and
cents
viii
it
has
been
decreed
in
the
privy
council
that
my
little
boy
shall
have
a
weekly
income
of
one
cent
every
sunday
morning
that
sum
shall
be
paid
to
him
free
of
out
of
the
treasury
and
he
has
leave
to
dispose
of
it
entirely
at
his
own
pleasure
he
receives
this
announcement
with
composure
and
sits
apart
for
a
while
and
ponders
on
it
every
sunday
he
asks
every
sunday
all
the
time
till
the
summer
holidays
all
the
time
till
the
summer
holidays
in
the
summer
holidays
he
is
to
go
to
the
country
to
stay
with
his
godmother
in
whose
house
he
was
pleased
to
allow
himself
to
be
born
the
summer
holidays
are
consequently
the
limits
of
his
calculation
of
time
beyond
them
lies
for
the
moment
his
nirvana
and
we
employ
this
restricted
horizon
of
ours
to
further
our
true
happiness
that
is
to
say
we
calculate
with
the
aid
of
the
almanac
that
if
everything
goes
as
heretofore
there
will
be
fifteen
sundays
before
the
summer
holidays
we
arrange
a
drawer
with
fifteen
compartments
and
in
each
compartment
we
put
one
cent
thus
we
know
exactly
what
we
have
and
are
able
at
any
time
to
survey
our
financial
status
and
when
he
sees
that
great
lot
of
cents
lying
there
my
little
breast
is
filled
with
mad
delight
he
feels
endlessly
rich
safe
for
a
long
time
the
courtyard
rings
with
his
bragging
with
all
that
he
is
going
to
do
with
his
money
his
special
favourites
are
invited
to
come
up
and
view
his
treasure
the
first
sunday
passes
in
a
normal
fashion
as
was
to
be
expected
he
takes
his
cent
and
turns
it
straightway
into
a
stick
of
chocolate
of
the
best
sort
with
almonds
on
it
and
sugar
in
short
an
ideal
stick
in
every
way
the
whole
performance
is
over
in
five
minutes
by
that
time
the
stick
of
chocolate
is
gone
with
the
sole
exception
of
a
remnant
in
the
corners
of
our
mouth
which
our
ruthless
mother
wipes
away
and
a
stain
on
our
collar
which
annoys
us
he
sits
by
me
with
a
vacant
little
face
and
swings
his
legs
i
open
the
drawer
and
look
at
the
empty
space
and
at
the
fourteen
others
so
gone
i
say
my
accent
betrays
a
certain
melancholy
which
finds
an
echo
in
his
breast
but
he
does
not
deliver
himself
of
it
at
once
father
is
it
long
till
next
sunday
very
long
my
boy
ever
so
many
days
we
sit
a
little
steeped
in
our
own
thoughts
then
i
say
pensively
now
if
you
had
bought
a
top
you
would
perhaps
have
had
more
pleasure
out
of
it
i
know
a
place
where
there
is
a
lovely
top
red
with
a
green
ring
round
it
it
is
just
over
the
way
in
the
i
saw
it
yesterday
i
should
be
greatly
mistaken
if
the
was
not
willing
to
sell
it
for
a
cent
and
you
got
a
whip
you
know
we
go
over
the
way
and
look
at
the
top
in
the
it
is
really
a
splendid
top
the
shop
shut
says
my
little
boy
despondently
i
look
at
him
with
surprise
yes
but
what
does
that
matter
to
us
anyway
we
ca
buy
the
top
before
next
sunday
you
see
you
spent
your
cent
on
chocolate
give
me
your
handkerchief
there
still
a
bit
on
your
cheek
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
crestfallen
and
pensively
we
go
home
we
sit
a
long
time
at
the
window
from
which
we
can
see
the
window
of
the
shop
during
the
course
of
the
week
we
look
at
the
top
daily
for
it
does
not
do
to
let
one
love
grow
cold
one
might
so
easily
forget
it
and
the
top
shines
always
more
seductively
we
go
in
and
make
sure
that
the
price
is
really
in
keeping
with
our
means
we
make
the
take
a
solemn
oath
to
keep
the
top
for
us
till
sunday
morning
even
if
boys
should
come
and
bid
him
much
higher
sums
for
it
on
sunday
morning
we
are
on
the
spot
before
nine
and
acquire
our
treasure
with
trembling
hands
and
we
play
with
it
all
day
and
sleep
with
it
at
night
until
on
wednesday
morning
it
disappears
without
a
trace
after
the
nasty
manner
which
tops
have
when
the
turn
comes
of
the
next
cent
something
remarkable
happens
there
is
a
boy
in
the
courtyard
who
has
a
and
my
little
boy
therefore
wants
to
have
a
too
but
this
is
a
difficult
matter
careful
enquiries
establish
the
fact
that
a
of
the
sort
used
by
the
upper
classes
is
nowhere
to
be
obtained
for
less
than
five
cents
the
business
is
discussed
as
early
as
saturday
it
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
i
say
you
must
not
spend
your
cent
tomorrow
next
sunday
you
must
do
the
same
and
the
next
and
the
next
on
the
sunday
after
that
you
will
have
saved
your
five
cents
and
can
buy
your
at
once
when
shall
i
get
my
then
in
five
sundays
from
now
he
says
nothing
but
i
can
see
that
he
does
not
think
my
idea
very
brilliant
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
derives
from
sources
unknown
to
me
an
acquaintance
with
financial
circumstances
which
he
serves
up
to
me
on
sunday
morning
in
the
following
words
father
you
must
lend
me
five
cents
for
the
if
you
will
lend
me
five
cents
for
the
i
give
you
cents
back
he
stands
close
to
me
very
red
in
the
face
and
quite
confused
i
perceive
that
he
is
ripe
for
falling
into
the
claws
of
the
usurers
i
do
do
that
sort
of
business
my
boy
i
say
it
would
do
you
any
good
either
and
you
not
even
in
a
position
to
do
it
for
you
have
only
thirteen
cents
as
you
know
he
collapses
like
one
whose
last
hope
is
gone
let
us
just
see
i
say
and
we
go
to
our
drawer
and
stare
at
it
long
and
deeply
we
might
perhaps
manage
it
this
way
that
i
give
you
five
cents
now
and
then
i
should
have
your
cent
and
the
next
four
cents
he
interrupts
me
with
a
loud
shout
i
take
out
my
purse
give
him
five
cents
and
take
one
cent
out
of
the
drawer
that
wo
be
pleasant
next
sunday
i
say
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
but
the
thoughtless
youth
is
gone
of
course
the
instalments
of
his
debt
are
paid
off
with
great
ceremony
he
is
always
on
the
spot
himself
when
the
drawer
is
opened
and
sees
how
the
requisite
cent
is
removed
and
finds
its
way
into
my
pocket
instead
of
his
the
first
time
all
goes
well
it
is
simply
an
amusing
thing
that
i
should
have
the
cent
and
the
is
still
fresh
in
his
memory
because
of
the
pangs
which
he
underwent
before
its
purchase
next
sunday
already
the
thing
is
not
so
pleasant
and
when
the
fourth
instalment
falls
due
my
little
boy
face
looks
very
gloomy
is
anything
the
matter
i
ask
i
should
so
much
like
a
stick
of
chocolate
he
says
without
looking
at
me
is
that
all
you
can
get
one
in
a
fortnight
by
that
time
you
will
have
paid
for
the
and
the
cent
will
be
your
own
again
i
should
so
much
like
to
have
the
stick
of
chocolate
now
of
course
i
am
full
of
the
sincerest
compassion
but
i
ca
help
it
what
gone
is
gone
we
saw
it
with
our
own
eyes
and
we
know
exactly
where
it
has
gone
to
and
that
sunday
morning
we
part
in
a
dejected
mood
later
in
the
day
however
i
find
him
standing
over
the
drawer
with
raised
eyebrows
and
a
mouth
i
sit
down
quietly
and
wait
and
i
do
not
have
to
wait
long
before
i
learn
that
his
development
as
an
economist
is
taking
quite
its
normal
course
father
suppose
we
moved
the
cent
now
from
here
into
this
place
and
i
took
it
and
bought
the
why
then
you
wo
have
your
cent
for
the
other
sunday
i
do
mind
that
father
we
talk
about
it
and
then
we
do
it
and
with
that
as
a
matter
of
course
we
enter
upon
the
most
reckless
peculations
the
very
next
sunday
he
is
clever
enough
to
take
the
furthest
cent
which
lies
just
before
the
summer
holidays
he
pursues
the
path
of
vice
without
a
scruple
until
at
last
the
blow
falls
and
five
long
sundays
come
in
a
row
without
the
least
chance
of
a
cent
where
should
they
come
from
they
were
there
we
know
that
they
are
gone
we
have
spent
them
ourselves
but
during
those
drab
days
of
poverty
we
sit
every
morning
over
the
empty
drawer
and
talk
long
and
profoundly
about
that
painful
phenomenon
which
is
so
simple
and
so
easy
to
understand
and
which
one
must
needs
make
the
best
of
and
we
hope
and
trust
that
our
experience
will
do
us
good
when
after
our
trip
we
start
a
new
set
of
cents
ix
my
little
boy
is
engaged
to
be
married
she
is
a
big
young
woman
three
years
his
senior
and
no
doubt
belongs
to
the
minor
aristocracy
her
name
is
gertie
by
a
misunderstanding
however
which
is
pardonable
at
his
age
and
moreover
quite
explained
by
gertie
appearance
he
calls
her
dirty
little
dirty
and
by
this
name
she
will
be
handed
down
to
history
he
met
her
on
the
boulevard
where
he
was
playing
in
the
fine
spring
weather
with
other
children
his
reason
for
the
engagement
is
good
enough
i
wanted
a
girl
for
myself
he
says
either
i
know
very
little
of
mankind
or
he
has
made
a
fortunate
choice
no
one
is
likely
to
take
dirty
from
him
like
the
gentleman
that
he
is
he
at
once
brings
the
girl
home
to
us
and
introduces
her
in
consequence
of
the
formality
of
the
occasion
he
does
not
go
in
by
the
kitchen
way
as
usual
but
rings
the
bell
i
open
the
door
myself
there
he
stands
on
the
mat
hand
in
hand
with
dirty
his
bride
and
with
radiant
eyes
father
he
says
this
is
little
dirty
she
is
my
sweetheart
we
are
going
to
be
married
that
is
what
people
usually
do
with
their
sweethearts
i
answer
philosophically
pray
dirty
come
in
and
be
welcomed
by
the
family
wipe
your
feet
dirty
says
my
little
boy
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
does
not
think
much
of
the
match
she
has
even
spoken
of
forbidding
dirty
the
house
we
ca
do
that
i
say
i
am
not
in
ecstasies
over
it
either
but
it
is
not
at
all
certain
that
it
will
last
yes
but
do
you
remember
what
little
use
it
was
when
your
mother
forbade
me
the
house
we
used
to
meet
in
the
most
incredible
places
and
kiss
each
other
terribly
i
can
quite
understand
that
you
have
forgotten
but
you
ought
to
bear
it
in
mind
now
that
your
son
beginning
and
you
ought
to
value
the
loyalty
of
his
behaviour
towards
his
aged
parents
my
dear
and
then
i
must
remind
you
that
it
is
spring
the
trees
are
budding
you
ca
see
it
perhaps
from
the
or
from
your
but
i
who
go
about
all
day
have
noticed
it
you
know
what
byron
says
march
has
its
hares
and
may
must
have
its
heroine
and
so
dirty
is
accepted
but
when
she
calls
she
has
first
to
undergo
a
short
quarantine
while
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
washes
her
and
combs
her
hair
thoroughly
dirty
does
not
like
this
but
the
boy
does
he
looks
on
with
extraordinary
interest
and
at
once
complains
if
there
is
a
place
that
has
escaped
the
sponge
i
ca
make
out
what
goes
on
within
him
on
these
occasions
there
is
a
good
deal
of
cruelty
in
love
and
he
himself
hates
to
be
washed
perhaps
he
is
rapt
in
fancies
and
wants
to
see
his
sweetheart
rise
daily
from
the
waves
like
venus
anadyomene
perhaps
it
is
merely
his
sense
of
duty
last
friday
in
cold
blood
he
allowed
dirty
to
wait
outside
on
the
step
for
half
an
hour
until
his
mother
came
home
another
of
his
joys
is
to
see
dirty
eat
i
can
quite
understand
that
here
as
at
her
toilet
there
is
something
worth
looking
at
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
and
i
would
be
glad
too
to
watch
her
if
there
were
any
chance
of
giving
dirty
her
fill
but
there
is
none
at
least
not
with
my
income
when
i
see
all
that
food
disappear
without
as
much
as
a
shade
of
satisfaction
coming
into
her
eyes
i
tremble
for
the
young
future
but
he
is
cheerful
and
unconcerned
of
course
there
are
also
clouds
in
their
sky
a
few
days
ago
they
were
sitting
quietly
together
in
the
and
talking
of
their
wedding
my
little
boy
described
what
the
house
would
be
like
and
the
garden
and
the
horses
dirty
made
no
remarks
and
she
had
no
grounds
for
doing
so
for
everything
was
particularly
nice
but
after
that
things
went
wrong
we
shall
have
fourteen
children
said
the
boy
no
said
dirty
we
shall
only
have
two
a
boy
and
a
girl
i
want
to
have
fourteen
i
wo
have
more
than
two
fourteen
two
there
was
no
coming
to
an
agreement
my
little
boy
was
speechless
at
dirty
meanness
and
dirty
pinched
her
lips
together
and
nodded
her
head
defiantly
then
he
burst
into
tears
i
could
have
explained
to
him
that
dirty
who
sits
down
every
day
as
the
seventh
at
the
children
table
at
home
can
not
look
upon
children
with
his
eyes
as
things
forming
an
essential
part
of
every
family
but
must
regard
them
rather
as
bandits
who
eat
up
other
food
but
i
did
not
feel
entitled
to
discuss
the
young
lady
domestic
circumstances
unasked
one
good
thing
about
dirty
is
that
she
is
not
dependent
upon
her
family
nor
they
upon
her
it
has
not
yet
happened
that
any
inquiries
have
been
made
after
her
however
long
she
remained
with
us
we
know
just
where
she
lives
and
what
her
father
name
is
nothing
more
however
we
notice
in
another
way
that
our
is
not
without
relations
whenever
for
instance
we
give
her
a
pair
of
stockings
or
some
other
article
of
clothing
it
is
always
gone
the
next
day
and
so
on
until
all
the
six
brothers
and
sisters
have
been
supplied
not
till
then
do
we
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
dirty
look
neat
she
has
been
so
long
accustomed
to
going
shares
that
she
does
so
in
every
conceivable
circumstance
and
i
console
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
by
saying
that
should
he
fall
out
with
dirty
he
can
take
one
of
the
sisters
and
that
in
this
way
nothing
would
be
lost
x
my
little
boy
confides
to
me
that
he
would
like
a
pear
now
pears
fall
within
his
mother
province
and
i
am
sure
that
he
has
had
as
many
as
he
is
entitled
to
and
so
we
are
at
once
agreed
that
what
he
wants
is
a
wholly
irrelevant
delightful
extra
pear
unfortunately
it
also
appears
that
the
request
has
already
been
laid
before
mamma
and
met
with
a
positive
refusal
the
situation
is
serious
but
not
hopeless
for
i
am
a
man
who
knows
how
mean
is
the
supply
of
pears
to
us
poor
wretched
children
of
men
and
how
wonderful
an
extra
pear
tastes
and
i
am
glad
that
my
little
boy
did
not
give
up
all
hope
of
the
pear
at
the
first
obstacle
i
can
see
by
the
longing
in
his
green
eyes
how
big
the
pear
is
and
i
reflect
with
lawful
paternal
pride
that
he
will
win
his
girl
and
his
position
in
life
when
their
time
comes
we
now
discuss
the
matter
carefully
first
comes
the
prospect
of
never
mind
about
that
says
he
i
quite
agree
with
his
view
then
perhaps
mother
will
be
angry
no
mother
is
never
angry
she
is
sorry
and
that
is
not
nice
but
then
we
must
see
and
make
it
up
to
her
in
another
way
so
we
slink
in
and
steal
the
pear
i
put
it
to
him
whether
perhaps
when
we
have
eaten
the
pear
we
ought
to
tell
mother
but
that
does
not
appeal
to
him
then
i
sha
get
one
this
evening
he
says
and
when
i
suggest
that
possibly
mother
might
be
impressed
with
such
audacious
candour
he
shakes
his
head
decisively
you
do
know
mother
he
says
so
i
of
course
have
nothing
to
say
shortly
after
this
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
and
i
are
standing
at
the
window
laughing
at
the
story
we
catch
sight
of
him
below
in
the
courtyard
he
is
sitting
on
the
steps
with
his
arm
round
little
dirty
neck
they
have
shared
the
pear
now
they
are
both
singing
marvellously
out
of
tune
and
with
a
disgustingly
sentimental
expression
on
their
faces
a
song
which
dirty
knows
for
riches
are
only
a
from
heaven
and
poverty
is
a
reward
and
we
are
overcome
with
a
great
sense
of
desolation
we
want
to
make
life
green
and
pleasant
for
our
little
boy
to
make
his
eyes
open
wide
to
see
it
his
hands
strong
to
grasp
it
but
we
feel
powerless
in
the
face
of
all
the
contentment
and
patience
and
resignation
that
are
preached
from
cellar
to
garret
in
church
and
in
school
all
those
virtues
which
may
lighten
an
old
last
few
steps
as
he
stumbles
on
towards
the
grave
but
which
are
only
so
many
shabby
lies
for
the
young
xi
dirty
is
paying
us
a
visit
and
my
little
boy
is
sitting
at
her
feet
she
has
buried
her
fingers
in
her
hair
and
is
reading
reading
reading
she
is
learning
the
ten
commandments
by
heart
she
stammers
and
repeats
herself
with
eyes
fixed
in
her
head
and
a
despairing
mouth
thou
shalt
thou
shalt
not
thou
shalt
the
boy
watches
her
with
tender
compassion
he
has
already
learnt
a
couple
of
the
commandments
by
listening
to
her
and
helps
her
now
and
then
with
a
word
then
he
comes
to
me
and
asks
anxiously
father
must
dirty
do
all
that
the
ten
commandments
say
yes
he
sits
down
by
her
again
his
heart
is
overflowing
with
pity
his
eyes
are
moist
she
does
not
look
at
him
but
plods
on
bravely
thou
shalt
thou
shalt
not
father
when
i
grow
big
must
i
also
do
all
that
the
ten
commandments
say
he
looks
at
me
in
utter
despair
then
he
goes
back
to
dirty
and
listens
but
now
he
keeps
his
thoughts
to
himself
suddenly
something
seems
to
flash
across
his
mind
he
comes
to
me
again
puts
his
arms
on
my
knee
and
looks
with
his
green
eyes
firmly
into
mine
father
do
you
do
all
that
the
ten
commandments
say
he
looks
like
a
person
whose
last
hope
has
escaped
him
i
would
so
much
like
to
help
him
but
what
in
heaven
name
can
i
do
then
he
collects
himself
shakes
his
head
a
little
and
says
with
great
tears
in
his
eyes
father
i
do
believe
that
i
can
do
all
those
things
that
the
ten
commandments
say
and
i
draw
him
to
me
and
we
cry
together
because
life
is
so
difficult
while
dirty
plods
away
like
a
good
girl
xii
this
we
all
know
that
sin
came
into
the
world
by
the
law
dirty
ten
commandments
have
brought
it
to
us
when
she
comes
she
now
always
has
luther
terrible
little
catechism
and
balslev
equally
objectionable
work
with
her
her
parents
evidently
look
upon
it
as
most
natural
that
she
should
also
cultivate
her
soul
at
our
house
footnote
lille
the
lutheran
catechism
in
general
use
in
a
de
her
copies
of
these
two
classics
were
not
published
yesterday
they
are
probably
heirlooms
in
dirty
family
they
are
covered
in
thick
brown
paper
which
again
is
protected
by
a
heavy
layer
of
dirt
against
any
touch
of
clean
fingers
they
can
be
smelt
at
a
distance
but
my
little
boy
is
no
snob
when
dirty
has
finished
her
studies
she
always
reads
out
aloud
he
asks
her
permission
to
turn
over
the
pages
of
the
works
in
which
she
finds
those
strange
words
he
stares
respectfully
at
the
letters
which
he
can
not
read
and
then
he
asks
questions
he
asks
dirty
he
asks
the
servant
he
asks
us
before
anyone
suspects
it
he
is
at
home
in
the
whole
field
of
theology
he
knows
that
god
is
in
heaven
where
all
good
people
go
to
him
while
the
wicked
are
put
down
below
in
hell
that
god
created
the
world
in
six
days
and
said
that
we
must
not
do
anything
on
sundays
that
god
can
do
everything
and
knows
everything
and
sees
everything
he
often
prays
creeps
upstairs
as
high
as
he
can
go
so
as
to
be
nearer
heaven
and
shouts
as
loud
as
he
can
the
other
day
i
found
him
at
the
top
of
the
dear
god
you
must
please
give
us
fine
weather
tomorrow
for
we
are
going
to
the
wood
he
says
to
everybody
except
god
and
the
grocer
he
never
compromises
the
servant
is
laying
the
table
we
have
guests
coming
and
we
call
her
attention
to
a
little
hole
in
the
cloth
i
must
lay
it
so
that
no
one
can
see
it
she
says
god
will
see
it
he
is
not
coming
this
evening
says
the
blasphemous
hussy
yes
he
is
everywhere
answers
my
little
boy
severely
he
looks
after
me
in
particular
you
must
say
father
dirty
teacher
says
that
people
who
say
go
to
hell
i
sha
say
it
again
i
reply
humbly
one
sunday
morning
he
finds
me
writing
and
upbraids
me
seriously
my
little
boy
i
say
distressfully
i
must
work
every
day
if
i
do
nothing
on
sunday
i
do
nothing
on
monday
either
if
i
do
nothing
on
monday
i
am
idle
on
tuesday
too
and
so
on
he
ponders
and
i
continue
with
the
courage
of
despair
you
must
have
noticed
that
dirty
wants
a
new
catechism
the
one
she
has
is
dirty
and
old
he
agrees
to
this
she
will
never
have
one
you
see
i
say
emphatically
her
father
rests
so
tremendously
on
sunday
that
he
is
hardly
able
to
do
anything
on
the
other
days
he
never
earns
enough
to
buy
a
new
catechism
i
have
won
this
engagement
but
the
war
is
continued
without
cessation
of
hostilities
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
and
i
are
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
his
bedside
and
softly
talking
about
this
what
are
we
to
do
she
asks
we
can
do
nothing
i
reply
dirty
is
right
god
is
everywhere
we
ca
keep
him
out
and
if
we
could
for
a
time
what
then
a
day
would
come
perhaps
when
our
little
boy
was
ill
or
sad
and
the
priests
would
come
to
him
with
their
god
as
a
new
and
untried
miraculous
remedy
and
bewilder
his
mind
and
his
senses
our
little
boy
too
will
have
to
go
through
luther
and
balslev
and
assens
and
confirmation
and
all
the
rest
of
it
then
this
will
become
a
commonplace
to
him
and
one
day
he
will
form
his
own
views
as
we
have
done
but
when
he
comes
and
asks
how
big
god
is
whether
he
is
bigger
than
the
round
tower
how
far
it
is
to
heaven
why
the
weather
was
not
fine
on
the
day
when
he
prayed
so
hard
for
it
then
we
fly
from
the
face
of
the
lord
and
hide
like
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
we
leave
dirty
to
explain
xiii
my
little
boy
has
got
a
rival
whose
name
is
henrik
a
popinjay
who
not
only
is
six
years
old
but
has
an
unlimited
supply
of
liquorice
at
his
disposal
and
to
fill
the
measure
of
my
little
boy
bitterness
henrik
is
to
go
to
the
and
i
am
therefore
not
surprised
when
my
little
boy
asks
to
be
taught
to
dance
so
that
he
may
not
be
left
quite
behind
in
the
contest
i
do
advise
you
to
do
that
i
say
the
dancing
which
you
learn
at
school
is
not
pretty
and
does
not
play
so
great
a
part
in
love
as
you
imagine
i
do
know
how
to
dance
and
many
charming
ladies
used
to
prefer
me
to
the
most
accomplished
ornaments
of
the
besides
you
know
you
are
and
to
cheer
him
up
i
sing
a
little
song
which
we
composed
when
we
were
small
and
had
a
dog
and
did
not
think
about
women
see
my
son
that
little
basset
running
with
his
legs
his
own
puppy
he
ca
catch
it
he
fall
down
as
sure
as
eggs
billy
is
he
silly
silly
billy
but
poetry
fails
to
comfort
him
dark
is
his
face
and
desperate
his
glance
and
when
i
see
that
the
case
is
serious
i
resolve
to
resort
to
serious
measures
i
take
him
with
me
to
a
ball
a
real
ball
where
people
who
have
learnt
to
dance
go
to
enjoy
themselves
it
is
difficult
to
keep
him
in
a
more
or
less
waking
condition
but
i
succeed
we
sit
quietly
in
a
corner
and
watch
the
merry
throng
i
say
not
a
word
but
look
at
his
eyes
father
why
does
that
man
jump
like
that
when
he
is
so
awfully
hot
yes
can
you
understand
it
why
does
that
lady
with
her
head
on
one
side
look
so
tired
why
does
that
fat
woman
hop
about
so
funnily
father
father
what
queer
legs
that
man
there
has
it
rains
questions
and
observations
we
make
jokes
and
laugh
till
the
tears
come
to
our
eyes
we
whisper
naughty
things
to
each
other
and
go
into
a
and
mimic
a
pair
of
crooked
legs
till
we
ca
hold
ourselves
for
laughter
we
sit
and
wait
till
a
steam
on
its
round
comes
past
us
and
we
are
fit
to
die
when
we
hear
it
puff
and
blow
we
enjoy
ourselves
beyond
measure
and
we
make
a
hit
the
steam
and
the
crooked
legs
and
the
fat
woman
and
the
hot
gentleman
and
others
crowd
round
us
and
admire
the
dear
little
boy
we
accept
their
praises
for
we
have
agreed
not
to
say
what
we
think
to
anybody
except
to
mother
when
we
come
home
and
then
of
course
to
dirty
and
we
wink
our
eyes
and
enjoy
our
delightful
fun
until
we
fall
asleep
and
are
driven
home
and
put
to
bed
and
then
we
have
done
with
the
my
little
boy
paints
in
strong
colours
for
his
dirty
benefit
what
henrik
will
look
like
when
he
dances
it
is
no
use
for
that
young
man
to
deny
all
that
my
little
boy
says
and
to
execute
different
elegant
steps
i
was
prepared
for
this
and
my
little
boy
tells
exultantly
that
this
is
only
something
with
which
they
lure
stupid
people
at
the
start
and
that
it
will
certainly
end
with
henrik
getting
very
hot
and
hopping
round
on
crooked
legs
with
a
fat
woman
and
a
face
of
despair
in
the
meantime
of
course
i
do
not
forget
that
if
we
pull
down
without
building
up
we
shall
end
by
landing
ourselves
in
an
unwholesome
scepticism
we
therefore
invent
various
dances
which
my
little
boy
executes
in
the
courtyard
to
dirty
joy
and
to
henrik
most
jealous
envy
we
point
emphatically
to
the
fact
that
the
dances
are
our
own
that
they
are
composed
only
for
the
woman
we
love
and
performed
only
for
her
there
is
for
instance
a
dance
with
a
stick
which
my
little
boy
wields
while
henrik
draws
back
another
with
a
pair
of
new
mittens
for
dirty
and
lastly
the
liquorice
dance
which
expresses
an
extraordinary
contempt
for
that
foodstuff
that
dirty
should
suck
a
stick
of
liquorice
which
she
has
received
from
henrik
while
enjoying
her
other
admirer
satire
naturally
staggers
my
little
boy
but
i
explain
to
him
that
that
is
because
she
is
a
woman
and
that
is
a
thing
which
ca
be
helped
what
bournonville
would
say
if
he
could
look
down
upon
us
from
his
place
in
heaven
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
believe
that
he
can
if
he
up
there
could
see
how
people
dance
down
here
he
really
would
not
stay
there

the
children
in
the
courtyard
i
hear
them
shouting
jew
and
i
go
to
the
window
and
see
my
little
boy
in
the
front
rank
of
the
bandits
screaming
fighting
with
clenched
fists
and
without
his
cap
i
sit
down
quietly
to
my
work
again
certain
that
he
will
appear
before
long
and
ease
his
heart
and
he
comes
directly
after
he
stands
still
as
is
his
way
by
my
side
and
says
nothing
i
steal
a
glance
at
him
he
is
greatly
excited
and
proud
and
glad
like
one
who
has
fearlessly
done
his
duty
what
fun
you
been
having
down
there
oh
he
says
modestly
it
was
only
a
jew
boy
whom
we
were
licking
i
jump
up
so
quickly
that
i
upset
my
chair
a
jew
boy
were
you
licking
him
what
had
he
done
nothing
his
voice
is
not
very
certain
for
i
look
so
queer
and
that
is
only
the
beginning
for
now
i
snatch
my
hat
and
run
out
of
the
door
as
fast
as
i
can
and
shout
come
come
we
must
find
him
and
beg
his
pardon
my
little
boy
hurries
after
me
he
does
not
understand
a
word
of
it
but
he
is
terribly
in
earnest
we
look
in
the
courtyard
we
shout
and
call
we
rush
into
the
street
and
round
the
corner
so
eager
are
we
to
come
up
with
him
breathlessly
we
ask
three
if
they
have
not
seen
a
poor
jew
boy
all
in
vain
the
jew
boy
and
all
his
persecutors
are
blown
away
into
space
so
we
go
and
sit
up
in
my
room
again
the
laboratory
where
our
soul
is
crystallized
out
of
the
big
events
of
our
little
life
my
forehead
is
wrinkled
and
i
drum
disconsolately
with
my
fingers
on
the
table
the
boy
has
both
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
does
not
take
his
eyes
from
my
face
well
i
say
decidedly
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
i
hope
you
will
meet
that
jew
boy
one
day
so
that
you
can
give
him
your
hand
and
ask
him
to
forgive
you
you
must
tell
him
that
you
did
that
only
because
you
were
stupid
but
if
another
time
anyone
does
him
any
harm
i
hope
you
will
help
him
and
lick
the
other
one
as
long
as
you
can
stir
a
limb
i
can
see
by
my
little
boy
face
that
he
is
ready
to
do
what
i
wish
for
he
is
still
a
mercenary
who
does
not
ask
under
which
flag
so
long
as
there
is
a
battle
and
booty
to
follow
it
is
my
duty
to
train
him
to
be
a
brave
recruit
who
will
defend
his
fair
and
so
i
continue
let
me
tell
you
the
jews
are
by
way
of
being
quite
wonderful
people
you
remember
david
about
whom
dirty
reads
at
school
he
was
a
jew
boy
and
the
child
jesus
whom
everybody
worships
and
loves
although
he
died
two
thousand
years
ago
he
was
a
little
jew
also
my
little
boy
stands
with
his
arms
on
my
knee
and
i
go
on
with
my
story
the
old
hebrews
rise
before
our
eyes
in
all
their
splendour
and
power
quite
different
from
dirty
balslev
they
ride
on
their
camels
in
coats
of
many
colours
and
with
long
beards
moses
and
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
samson
and
david
and
saul
we
hear
wonderful
stories
the
walls
of
jericho
fall
at
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
and
what
next
says
my
little
boy
using
the
expression
which
he
employed
when
he
was
much
smaller
and
which
still
comes
to
his
lips
whenever
he
is
carried
away
we
hear
of
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
how
the
jews
took
their
little
boys
by
the
hand
and
wandered
from
place
to
place
scoffed
at
despised
and
how
they
were
allowed
to
own
neither
house
nor
land
but
could
only
be
merchants
and
how
the
christian
robbers
took
all
the
money
which
they
had
got
together
how
nevertheless
they
remained
true
to
their
god
and
kept
up
their
old
sacred
customs
in
the
midst
of
the
strangers
who
hated
and
persecuted
them
the
whole
day
is
devoted
to
the
jews
we
look
at
old
books
on
the
shelves
which
i
love
best
to
read
and
which
are
written
by
a
jew
with
a
wonderful
name
which
a
little
boy
remember
at
all
we
learn
that
the
most
famous
man
now
living
in
denmark
is
a
jew
and
when
evening
comes
and
mother
sits
down
at
the
piano
and
sings
the
song
which
father
loves
above
all
other
songs
it
appears
that
the
words
were
written
by
one
jew
and
the
melody
composed
by
another
my
little
boy
is
hot
and
red
when
he
falls
to
sleep
that
night
he
turns
restlessly
in
bed
and
talks
in
his
sleep
he
is
a
little
feverish
says
his
mother
and
i
bend
down
and
kiss
his
forehead
and
answer
calmly
that
is
not
surprising
today
i
have
vaccinated
him
against
the
meanest
of
all
mean
and
vulgar
diseases
xv
we
are
staying
in
the
country
a
long
way
out
where
the
real
country
is
cows
and
horses
pigs
and
sheep
a
beautiful
dog
and
hens
and
ducks
form
our
circle
of
acquaintances
in
addition
to
these
there
are
of
course
the
beings
who
own
and
look
after
the
ones
and
who
in
my
little
boy
eyes
belong
to
quite
the
same
kind
the
great
sea
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
ships
float
in
the
distance
and
have
nothing
to
say
to
us
the
sun
burns
us
and
bronzes
us
we
eat
like
thrashers
sleep
like
and
wake
like
larks
the
only
real
sorrow
that
we
have
suffered
is
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
have
our
breeches
made
with
a
flap
at
the
side
like
the
old
presently
it
happens
that
for
better
or
worse
we
get
neighbours
they
are
regular
copenhageners
they
were
prepared
not
to
find
electric
light
in
the
but
if
they
had
known
that
there
was
no
water
in
the
kitchen
god
knows
they
would
not
have
come
they
trudge
through
the
clover
as
though
it
were
mire
and
are
sorry
to
find
so
few
cornflowers
in
the
rye
a
cow
going
loose
along
the
roads
fills
them
with
a
terror
which
might
easily
have
satisfied
a
royal
tiger
the
pearl
of
the
family
is
erna
erna
is
five
years
old
her
very
small
face
is
pale
green
with
watery
blue
eyes
and
yellow
curls
she
is
richly
and
gaily
dressed
in
a
broad
and
slovenly
sash
pantalets
short
socks
and
shoes
she
falls
if
she
but
moves
a
foot
for
she
is
used
only
to
gliding
over
polished
floors
or
asphalt
i
at
once
perceive
that
my
little
boy
eyes
have
seen
a
woman
he
has
seen
the
woman
that
comes
to
us
all
at
one
time
or
another
and
turns
our
heads
with
her
rustling
silks
and
her
glossy
hair
and
wears
her
soul
in
her
skirts
and
our
poor
hearts
under
her
heel
now
comes
the
perilous
moment
for
dirty
i
say
to
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
this
time
it
is
my
little
boy
turn
to
be
superior
he
knows
the
business
thoroughly
and
explains
it
all
to
erna
when
he
worries
the
horse
she
trembles
impressed
with
his
courage
and
manliness
when
she
has
a
fit
of
terror
at
the
sight
of
a
hen
he
is
charmed
with
her
delicacy
he
knows
the
way
to
the
smith
he
dares
to
roll
down
the
high
slope
he
chivalrously
carries
her
ridiculous
little
cape
altogether
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
condition
of
his
heart
and
while
erna
family
apparently
favour
the
position
for
which
may
the
devil
take
them
i
must
needs
wait
with
resignation
like
one
who
knows
that
love
is
every
man
master
one
morning
he
proposes
he
is
sitting
with
his
beloved
on
the
lawn
close
to
them
her
aunt
is
nursing
her
chlorosis
under
a
red
parasol
and
with
a
novel
in
her
bony
lap
up
in
the
balcony
above
sit
i
as
providence
and
see
everything
myself
unseen
you
shall
be
my
sweetheart
says
my
little
boy
yes
says
erna
i
have
a
sweetheart
already
in
copenhagen
he
says
proudly
this
communication
naturally
by
no
means
lowers
erna
suitor
in
her
eyes
but
it
immediately
arouses
all
auntie
moral
instincts
if
you
have
a
sweetheart
you
must
be
true
to
her
erna
shall
be
my
sweetheart
auntie
turns
her
eyes
up
to
heaven
listen
child
she
says
you
a
very
naughty
boy
if
you
have
given
dir
dir
dirty
says
the
boy
well
that
an
extraordinary
name
but
if
you
have
given
her
your
word
you
must
keep
it
till
you
die
else
you
never
never
be
happy
my
little
boy
understands
not
a
word
and
answers
not
a
word
erna
begins
to
cry
at
the
prospect
that
this
good
match
may
not
come
off
but
i
bend
down
over
the
baluster
and
raise
my
hat
i
beg
your
pardon
fröken
was
it
not
you
who
jilted
hr
petersen
good
heavens
she
packs
up
her
chlorosis
and
disappears
with
erna
mumbling
something
about
like
father
like
son
and
goodness
knows
what
presently
my
little
boy
comes
up
to
me
and
stands
and
hangs
about
where
has
erna
gone
to
i
ask
my
little
boy
she
must
go
out
he
says
dejectedly
he
puts
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looks
straight
before
him
father
he
says
ca
you
have
two
sweethearts
the
question
comes
quite
unexpectedly
and
at
the
moment
i
do
know
what
to
answer
well
says
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
amiably
and
looks
up
from
her
newspaper
and
i
pull
my
waistcoat
down
and
my
collar
up
yes
i
say
firmly
you
can
but
it
is
wrong
it
leads
to
more
fuss
and
unpleasantness
than
you
can
possibly
conceive
a
silence
are
you
so
fond
of
erna
asks
our
mother
yes
do
you
want
to
marry
her
yes
i
get
up
and
rub
my
hands
then
the
thing
is
settled
i
say
we
write
to
dirty
and
give
her
notice
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
i
will
write
now
and
you
can
give
the
letter
yourself
to
the
postman
when
he
comes
this
afternoon
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
make
her
a
present
of
your
ball
then
she
will
not
be
so
much
upset
she
can
have
my
too
if
she
likes
says
the
boy
excellent
excellent
we
will
give
her
the
then
she
will
really
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
complain
of
my
little
boy
goes
away
but
presently
he
returns
father
have
you
written
the
letter
to
dirty
not
yet
my
boy
there
is
time
enough
i
forget
it
father
i
am
so
fond
of
dirty
she
was
certainly
a
dear
little
girl
a
silence
father
i
am
also
so
fond
of
erna
we
look
at
each
other
this
is
no
joke
perhaps
we
had
better
wait
with
the
letter
till
tomorrow
i
say
or
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
we
talked
to
dirty
ourselves
when
we
get
back
to
town
we
both
ponder
over
the
matter
and
really
do
know
what
to
do
then
my
eyes
surprise
an
indescribable
smile
on
our
mother
face
all
a
woman
incapacity
to
understand
man
honesty
is
contained
within
that
smile
and
i
resent
it
greatly
come
i
say
and
give
my
hand
to
my
little
boy
let
us
go
and
we
go
to
a
place
we
know
of
far
away
behind
the
hedge
where
we
lie
on
our
backs
and
look
up
at
the
blue
sky
and
talk
together
sensibly
as
two
gentlemen
should
xvi
my
little
boy
is
to
go
to
school
we
ca
keep
him
at
home
any
longer
says
his
mother
he
himself
is
glad
to
go
of
course
because
he
does
not
know
what
school
is
i
know
what
it
is
and
i
know
also
that
there
is
no
escape
for
him
that
he
must
go
but
i
am
sick
at
heart
all
that
is
good
within
me
revolts
against
the
inevitable
so
we
go
for
our
last
morning
walk
along
the
road
where
something
wonderful
has
always
happened
to
us
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
trees
have
crape
wound
round
their
tops
and
the
birds
sing
in
a
minor
key
and
the
people
stare
at
me
with
earnest
and
sympathetic
eyes
but
my
little
boy
sees
nothing
he
is
only
excited
at
the
prospect
he
talks
and
asks
questions
without
stopping
we
sit
down
by
the
edge
of
our
usual
ditch
alas
that
ditch
and
suddenly
my
heart
triumphs
over
my
understanding
the
voice
of
my
clear
conscience
penetrates
through
the
whole
and
harmonious
choir
which
is
to
give
the
concert
and
it
sings
its
solo
in
the
ears
of
my
little
boy
i
just
want
to
tell
you
that
school
is
a
horrid
place
i
say
you
can
have
no
conception
of
what
you
will
have
to
put
up
with
there
they
will
tell
you
that
two
and
two
are
four
mother
has
taught
me
that
already
says
he
blithely
yes
but
that
is
wrong
you
poor
wretch
i
cry
two
and
two
are
never
four
or
only
very
seldom
and
that
not
all
they
will
try
to
make
you
believe
that
teheran
is
the
capital
of
persia
and
that
mont
blanc
is
feet
high
and
you
will
take
them
at
their
word
but
i
tell
you
that
both
teheran
and
persia
are
nothing
at
all
an
empty
sound
a
stupid
joke
and
mont
blanc
is
not
half
as
big
as
the
mound
in
the
and
listen
you
will
never
have
any
more
time
to
play
in
the
courtyard
with
einar
when
he
shouts
to
you
to
come
out
you
have
to
sit
and
read
about
a
lot
of
horrible
old
kings
who
have
been
dead
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
if
they
ever
existed
at
all
which
i
for
my
part
simply
do
believe
my
little
boy
does
not
understand
me
but
he
sees
that
i
am
sad
and
puts
his
hand
in
mine
mother
says
that
you
must
go
to
school
to
become
a
clever
boy
he
says
mother
says
that
einar
is
ever
so
much
too
small
and
stupid
to
go
to
school
i
bow
my
head
and
nod
and
say
nothing
that
is
past
and
i
take
him
to
school
and
see
how
he
storms
up
the
steps
without
so
much
as
turning
his
head
to
look
back
at
me
xvii
here
ends
this
book
about
my
little
boy
what
more
can
there
be
to
tell
he
is
no
longer
mine
i
have
handed
him
over
to
society
hr
petersen
candidate
in
letters
hr
nielsen
student
of
theology
and
fröken
hansen
certificated
teacher
will
now
set
their
distinguished
example
before
him
for
five
hours
daily
he
will
form
himself
in
their
likeness
their
spirit
hovers
over
him
at
school
he
brings
it
home
with
him
it
overshadows
him
when
he
is
learning
the
lessons
which
they
zealously
mete
out
to
him
i
do
know
these
people
but
i
pay
them
i
who
have
had
a
hard
fight
to
keep
my
thoughts
free
and
my
limbs
unrestrained
and
who
have
not
retired
from
the
fight
without
deep
wounds
of
which
i
am
reminded
when
the
weather
changes
i
have
of
my
own
free
will
brought
him
to
the
institution
for
maiming
human
beings
i
who
at
times
have
soared
to
peaks
that
were
my
own
because
the
other
birds
dared
not
follow
me
have
myself
brought
him
to
the
place
where
wings
are
clipped
for
flying
respectably
with
the
flock
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
says
the
mother
of
my
little
boy
really
i
reply
bitterly
was
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
but
suppose
that
i
had
put
by
some
money
so
that
i
could
have
saved
petersen
and
nielsen
and
fröken
hansen
their
trouble
and
employed
my
day
in
myself
opening
out
lands
for
that
little
traveller
whom
i
myself
have
brought
into
the
land
suppose
that
i
had
looked
round
the
world
for
people
with
small
boys
who
think
as
i
do
and
that
we
had
taken
upon
us
to
bring
up
these
young
animals
so
that
they
kept
sight
of
horns
and
tails
and
yes
she
says
small
boys
have
a
bad
time
of
it
you
know
they
had
a
worse
time
of
it
in
the
old
days
that
is
a
poor
comfort
and
it
can
become
worse
again
the
world
is
full
of
parents
and
teachers
who
shake
their
foolish
heads
and
turn
up
their
old
eyes
and
cross
their
flat
chests
with
horror
at
the
depravity
of
youth
children
are
so
disobedient
so
naughty
so
and
talk
so
disrespectfully
to
their
elders
and
what
do
we
do
we
who
know
better
we
do
what
we
can
but
i
walk
about
the
room
more
and
more
indignant
and
ashamed
of
the
pitiful
part
which
i
am
playing
do
you
remember
a
little
while
ago
he
came
to
me
and
said
that
he
longed
so
for
the
country
and
asked
if
we
could
go
there
for
a
little
there
were
horses
and
cows
and
green
fields
to
be
read
in
his
eyes
well
i
could
leave
my
work
and
i
could
afford
it
so
i
treated
him
to
a
shabby
and
sermon
about
the
tailor
to
whom
i
owed
money
do
you
understand
that
i
let
my
little
boy
do
work
that
i
let
him
pay
debt
i
bend
down
over
her
and
say
earnestly
you
must
know
do
please
tell
me
god
help
me
i
do
not
know
if
i
ought
not
rather
to
have
paid
my
debt
to
the
boy
and
cheated
the
other
you
know
quite
well
she
says
she
says
it
in
such
a
way
and
looks
at
me
with
two
such
sensible
eyes
and
is
so
strong
and
so
true
that
i
suddenly
think
things
look
quite
well
for
our
little
boy
and
i
become
restful
and
cheerful
like
herself
let
petersen
and
nielsen
and
hansen
look
out
i
say
my
little
boy
for
what
i
care
may
take
from
them
all
the
english
and
geography
and
history
that
he
can
but
they
shall
throw
no
dust
in
his
eyes
i
shall
keep
him
awake
and
we
shall
have
great
fun
and
find
them
out
and
i
shall
help
him
with
his
english
and
geography
and
history
