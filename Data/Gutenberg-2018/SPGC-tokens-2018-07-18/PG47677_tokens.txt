the
art
of
love
by
ovid
literally
translated
into
english
prose
with
copious
notes
by
henry
riley
book
the
first
any
one
of
the
people
not
know
the
art
of
loving
let
him
read
me
and
taught
by
me
on
reading
my
lines
let
him
love
by
art
the
ships
are
onward
sped
by
sails
and
oars
by
art
are
the
light
chariots
by
art
is
love
to
be
guided
in
the
chariot
and
in
the
flowing
reins
was
automedon
skilled
in
the
hæmonian
ship
tiphys
was
the
pilot
me
too
skilled
in
my
craft
has
venus
made
the
guardian
of
love
of
cupid
the
tiphys
and
the
automedon
shall
i
be
styled
unruly
indeed
he
is
and
one
who
oft
rebels
against
me
but
he
is
a
child
his
age
is
tender
and
easy
to
be
governed
the
son
of
phillyra
made
the
boy
achilles
skilled
at
the
lyre
and
with
his
soothing
art
he
subdued
his
ferocious
disposition
he
who
so
oft
alarmed
his
own
companions
so
oft
the
foe
is
believed
to
have
stood
in
dread
of
an
aged
man
full
of
years
those
hands
which
hector
was
doomed
to
feel
at
the
request
of
his
master
he
held
out
for
stripes
as
commanded
chiron
was
the
preceptor
of
the
grandson
of
æacus
i
of
love
both
of
the
boys
were
wild
both
of
a
goddess
born
but
yet
the
neck
of
even
the
bull
is
laden
with
the
plough
and
the
reins
are
champed
by
the
teeth
of
the
spirited
steed
to
me
too
will
love
yield
though
with
his
bow
he
should
wound
my
breast
and
should
brandish
his
torches
hurled
against
me
the
more
that
love
has
pierced
me
the
more
has
he
relentlessly
inflamed
me
so
much
the
fitter
avenger
shall
i
be
of
the
wounds
so
made
phoebus
i
pretend
not
that
these
arts
were
bestowed
on
me
by
thee
nor
by
the
notes
of
the
birds
of
the
air
am
i
inspired
neither
clio
nor
the
sisters
of
clio
have
been
beheld
by
me
while
watching
ascra
in
thy
vales
my
flocks
to
this
work
experience
gives
rise
listen
to
a
poet
the
truth
will
i
sing
mother
of
love
favour
my
design
be
ye
afar
ye
with
the
thin
fillets
on
your
hair
the
mark
of
chastity
and
thou
long
flounce
which
dost
conceal
the
middle
of
the
foot
we
will
sing
of
guiltless
delights
and
of
thefts
allowed
and
in
my
song
there
shall
be
nought
that
is
criminal
in
the
first
place
endeavour
to
find
out
an
object
which
you
may
desire
to
love
you
who
are
now
coming
for
the
first
time
to
engage
as
a
soldier
in
a
new
service
the
next
task
after
that
is
to
prevail
on
the
fair
by
pleasing
her
the
third
is
for
her
love
to
prove
of
long
duration
this
is
my
plan
this
space
shall
be
marked
out
by
my
chariot
this
the
to
be
grazed
by
my
wheels
in
their
full
career
while
you
may
and
while
you
are
able
to
proceed
with
flowing
reins
choose
one
to
whom
you
may
say
you
alone
are
pleasing
to
me
she
will
not
come
to
you
gliding
through
the
yielding
air
the
fair
one
that
suits
must
be
sought
with
your
eyes
the
hunter
knows
full
well
where
to
extend
the
toils
for
the
deer
full
well
he
knows
in
what
vale
dwells
the
boar
gnashing
with
his
teeth
the
shrubberies
are
known
to
the
fowlers
he
who
holds
out
the
hooks
knows
what
waters
are
swam
in
by
many
a
fish
you
too
who
seek
a
subject
for
enduring
love
first
learn
in
what
spot
the
fair
are
to
be
met
with
in
your
search
i
will
not
bid
you
give
your
sails
to
the
wind
nor
is
a
long
path
to
be
trodden
by
you
that
you
may
find
her
let
perseus
bear
away
his
andromeda
from
the
tawny
indians
and
let
the
grecian
fair
be
ravished
by
paris
the
phrygian
hero
rome
will
present
you
damsels
as
many
and
full
as
fair
so
that
you
will
declare
that
whatever
has
been
on
the
earth
she
possesses
as
many
ears
of
corn
as
gargara
has
as
many
clusters
as
methymna
as
many
fishes
as
are
concealed
in
the
seas
birds
in
the
boughs
as
many
stars
as
heaven
has
so
many
fair
ones
does
your
own
rome
contain
and
in
her
own
city
does
the
mother
of
æneas
hold
her
reign
are
you
charmed
by
early
and
still
dawning
years
the
maiden
in
all
her
genuineness
will
come
before
your
eyes
or
do
you
wish
a
riper
fair
a
thousand
riper
will
please
you
you
will
be
forced
not
to
know
which
is
your
own
choice
or
does
an
age
mature
and
more
staid
delight
you
this
throng
too
believe
me
will
be
even
greater
do
you
only
saunter
at
your
leisure
in
the
shade
of
pompey
portico
when
the
sun
approaches
the
back
of
the
lion
of
hercules
or
where
the
mother
has
added
her
own
gifts
to
those
of
her
son
a
work
rich
in
its
foreign
marble
and
let
not
the
portico
of
livia
be
shunned
by
you
which
here
and
there
adorned
with
ancient
paintings
bears
the
name
of
its
founder
where
too
are
the
of
who
dared
to
plot
death
for
their
wretched
cousins
and
where
their
enraged
father
stands
with
his
drawn
sword
nor
let
adonis
bewailed
by
venus
escape
you
and
the
seventh
observed
by
the
jew
of
syria
nor
fly
from
the
memphian
temples
of
isis
the
heifer
she
has
made
many
a
woman
that
which
she
was
herself
to
jove
even
the
courts
who
would
have
believed
it
are
favourable
to
love
and
oft
in
the
noisy
forum
has
the
flame
been
found
where
the
erection
of
appius
adjoining
the
temple
of
venus
built
of
marble
beats
the
air
with
its
shooting
stream
in
that
spot
full
oft
is
the
pleader
seized
by
love
and
he
that
has
defended
others
the
same
does
not
defend
himself
oft
in
that
spot
are
their
words
found
wanting
to
the
eloquent
man
and
new
cares
arise
and
his
own
cause
has
to
be
pleaded
from
her
temple
which
is
adjoining
venus
laughs
at
him
he
who
so
lately
was
a
patron
now
wishes
to
become
a
client
but
especially
at
the
curving
theatres
do
you
hunt
for
prey
these
places
are
even
yet
more
fruitful
for
your
desires
there
you
will
find
what
you
may
love
what
you
may
trifle
with
both
what
you
may
once
touch
and
what
you
may
wish
to
keep
as
the
numberless
ants
come
and
go
in
lengthened
train
when
they
are
carrying
their
wonted
food
in
the
mouth
that
bears
the
grains
or
as
the
bees
when
they
have
found
both
their
own
pastures
and
the
balmy
meads
hover
around
the
flowers
and
the
tops
of
the
thyme
so
rush
the
women
to
the
thronged
spectacles
a
multitude
that
oft
has
kept
my
judgment
in
suspense
they
come
to
see
they
come
that
they
themselves
may
be
seen
to
modest
chastity
these
spots
are
detrimental
romulus
was
thou
didst
first
institute
the
exciting
games
at
the
time
when
the
ravished
sabine
fair
came
to
the
aid
of
the
solitary
men
then
neither
did
curtains
hang
over
the
marble
theatre
nor
was
the
stage
blushing
with
liquid
saffron
there
the
branches
were
simply
arranged
which
the
woody
palatium
bore
the
scene
was
void
of
art
on
the
steps
made
of
turf
sit
the
people
the
branches
promiscuously
overshadowing
their
shaggy
locks
they
look
about
them
and
they
mark
with
their
eyes
each
for
himself
the
damsel
which
to
choose
and
in
their
silent
minds
they
devise
full
many
a
plan
and
while
as
the
etrurian
piper
sends
forth
his
harsh
notes
the
actor
with
his
foot
thrice
beats
the
levelled
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
applause
in
those
days
applause
was
void
of
guile
the
king
gives
to
his
people
the
signal
to
be
awaited
for
the
spoil
at
once
they
start
up
and
disclosing
their
intentions
with
a
shout
lay
their
greedy
hands
upon
the
maidens
as
the
doves
a
startled
throng
fly
from
the
eagles
and
as
the
young
iamb
flies
from
the
wolves
when
seen
in
such
manner
do
they
dread
the
men
indiscriminately
rushing
on
the
complexion
remains
in
none
which
existed
there
before
for
their
fear
is
the
same
the
symptoms
of
their
fear
not
the
same
some
tear
their
hair
some
sit
without
consciousness
one
is
silent
in
her
grief
another
vainly
calls
upon
her
mother
this
one
laments
this
one
is
astounded
this
one
tarries
that
one
takes
to
flight
the
ravished
fair
ones
are
carried
off
a
matrimonial
spoil
and
shame
itself
may
have
been
becoming
to
many
a
one
if
one
struggled
excessively
and
repelled
her
companion
borne
off
the
man
himself
lifted
her
into
his
eager
bosom
and
thus
he
spoke
why
spoil
your
charming
eyes
with
tears
what
to
your
mother
your
father
was
the
same
will
i
be
to
you
romulus
was
thou
alone
didst
understand
how
to
give
rewards
to
thy
soldiers
give
such
a
reward
to
me
and
i
will
be
a
soldier
in
good
truth
from
that
transaction
the
festive
theatres
even
to
this
day
continue
to
be
treacherous
to
the
handsome
and
let
not
the
contest
of
the
noble
steeds
escape
you
the
roomy
circus
of
the
people
has
many
advantages
there
is
no
need
there
of
fingers
with
which
to
talk
over
your
secrets
nor
must
a
hint
be
taken
by
you
through
nods
be
seated
next
to
your
mistress
there
being
no
one
to
prevent
it
press
your
side
to
her
side
as
close
as
ever
you
can
and
conveniently
enough
because
the
partition
compels
you
to
sit
close
even
if
she
be
unwilling
and
because
by
the
custom
of
the
place
the
fair
one
must
be
touched
by
you
here
let
the
occasion
be
sought
by
you
for
some
friendly
chat
and
let
the
usual
subjects
lead
to
the
first
words
take
care
and
enquire
with
an
air
of
anxiety
whose
horses
those
are
coming
and
without
delay
whoever
it
is
to
whom
she
wishes
well
to
him
do
you
also
wish
well
but
when
the
thronged
procession
shall
walk
with
the
holy
statues
of
ivory
do
you
applaud
your
mistress
venus
with
zealous
hand
and
as
often
happens
if
perchance
a
little
dust
should
fall
on
the
bosom
of
the
fair
it
must
be
brushed
off
with
your
fingers
and
if
there
should
be
no
dust
still
brush
off
that
none
let
any
excuse
be
a
prelude
to
your
attentions
if
her
mantle
hanging
too
low
shall
be
trailing
on
the
earth
gather
it
up
and
carefully
raise
it
from
the
dirty
ground
at
once
as
the
reward
of
your
attention
the
fair
permitting
it
her
ancles
will
chance
to
be
seen
by
your
eyes
look
too
behind
who
shall
be
sitting
behind
you
that
he
may
not
press
her
tender
back
with
his
knee
against
it
trifles
attract
trifling
minds
it
has
proved
to
the
advantage
of
many
a
one
to
make
a
cushion
with
his
ready
hand
it
has
been
of
use
too
to
waft
a
breeze
with
the
graceful
fan
and
to
place
the
hollow
footstool
beneath
her
delicate
feet
both
the
circus
and
the
sand
spread
for
its
sad
duties
in
the
bustling
forum
will
afford
these
overtures
to
a
dawning
passion
on
that
sand
oft
has
the
son
of
venus
fought
and
he
who
has
come
to
be
a
spectator
of
wounds
himself
receives
a
wound
while
he
is
talking
and
is
touching
her
hand
and
is
asking
for
the
racing
list
and
having
deposited
the
stake
is
enquiring
which
has
conquered
wounded
he
sighs
and
feels
the
flying
dart
and
himself
becomes
a
portion
of
the
spectacle
so
viewed
besides
when
of
late
cæsar
on
the
representation
of
a
rival
fight
introduced
the
persian
and
athenian
ships
in
truth
from
both
seas
came
youths
from
both
came
the
fair
and
in
the
city
was
the
whole
of
the
great
world
who
in
that
throng
did
not
find
an
object
for
him
to
love
how
many
alas
did
a
foreign
flame
torment
see
cæsar
prepares
to
add
what
was
wanting
to
the
world
subdued
now
remote
east
our
own
shalt
thou
be
parthian
thou
shalt
give
satisfaction
entombed
crassi
rejoice
ye
standards
too
that
disgracefully
submitted
to
barbarian
hands
your
avenger
is
at
hand
and
proves
himself
a
general
in
his
earliest
years
and
while
a
boy
is
conducting
a
war
not
fitted
to
be
waged
by
a
boy
cease
in
your
fears
to
count
the
of
the
gods
valour
is
the
lot
of
the
cæsars
in
advance
of
their
years
the
divine
genius
rises
more
rapidly
than
its
years
and
brooks
not
the
evils
of
slow
delay
the
tirynthian
hero
was
a
baby
and
he
crushed
two
serpents
in
his
hands
even
in
his
cradle
he
was
already
worthy
of
jove
bacchus
who
even
now
art
a
boy
how
mighty
wast
thou
then
when
conquered
india
dreaded
thy
thyrsi
with
the
auspices
and
the
courage
of
thy
sire
thou
youth
shalt
wield
arms
and
with
the
courage
and
the
auspices
of
thy
sire
shalt
thou
conquer
such
first
lessons
are
thy
due
under
a
name
so
great
now
the
first
of
the
youths
at
a
future
day
to
be
the
first
of
the
men
since
thou
hast
brothers
avenge
thy
brethren
slain
and
since
thou
hast
a
sire
vindicate
the
rights
of
thy
sire
he
the
father
of
thy
country
and
thine
own
hath
put
thee
in
arms
the
enemy
is
tearing
realms
away
from
thy
reluctant
sire
thou
wilt
wield
the
weapons
of
duty
the
foe
arrows
accursed
before
thy
standard
justice
and
duty
will
take
their
post
by
the
badness
of
their
cause
the
parthians
are
conquered
in
arms
too
may
they
be
overcome
may
my
hero
add
to
latium
the
wealth
of
the
east
both
thou
father
mars
and
thou
father
cæsar
grant
your
divine
favour
as
he
sets
out
for
the
one
of
you
is
now
a
deity
thou
the
other
wilt
so
be
what
parthian
dost
thou
leave
to
the
conquered
who
dost
fly
that
thou
mayst
overcome
parthian
even
now
has
thy
mode
of
warfare
an
unhappy
omen
and
will
that
day
then
come
on
which
thou
the
most
graceful
of
all
objects
glittering
with
gold
shalt
go
drawn
by
the
four
steeds
before
thee
shall
walk
the
chiefs
their
necks
laden
with
chains
that
they
may
no
longer
as
formerly
be
secure
in
flight
the
joyous
youths
and
the
mingled
fair
shall
be
looking
on
and
that
day
shall
gladden
the
minds
of
all
and
when
some
one
of
the
fair
shall
enquire
the
names
of
the
monarchs
what
places
what
mountains
or
what
rivers
are
borne
in
the
procession
answer
to
it
all
and
not
only
if
she
shall
make
any
inquiry
even
what
you
know
not
relate
as
though
known
perfectly
well
this
is
the
euphrates
with
his
forehead
encircled
with
reeds
the
one
whose
azure
hair
is
streaming
down
will
be
the
tigris
make
these
to
be
the
armenians
this
is
persia
sprung
from
danaë
that
was
a
city
in
the
vales
of
this
one
or
that
will
be
the
leaders
and
there
will
be
names
for
you
to
call
them
by
correctly
if
you
can
if
not
still
by
such
as
suggest
themselves
banquets
too
with
the
tables
arranged
afford
an
introduction
there
is
something
there
besides
wine
for
you
to
look
for
full
oft
does
blushing
cupid
with
his
delicate
arms
press
the
soothed
horns
of
bacchus
there
present
and
when
the
wine
has
besprinkled
the
soaking
wings
of
cupid
there
he
remains
and
stands
overpowered
on
the
spot
of
his
capture
he
indeed
quickly
flaps
his
moistened
wings
but
still
it
is
fatal

i

teach
you
by
what
arts
she

be
captured
who
has
pleased
you
a
work
of
especial
skill
ye

whoever
you

in

give
attention
eager
to
be
informed
and
give
all
people
a
favourable
ear
to
the
realization
of
my
promises
first
of
all
let
a
confidence
enter
your
mind
that
all
women
may
be
won
you
will
win
them
do
you
only
lay
your

sooner
would
the

be
silent
in

the
grasshoppers
in

sooner
would
the
mænalian
dog
turn
its
back
upon
the
hare
than
the
fair
attentively
courted
would
resist
the
youth
she
however
will
wish
you
to
believe
so
far
as
you
can
that
she
is
reluctant
lo
i
utter
a
prophecy
thou
wilt
conquer
and
i
shall
offer
the
lines
which
i
have
vowed
and
with
a
loud
voice
wilt
thou
have
to
be
celebrated
by
me
thou
wilt
there
he
taking
thy
stand
and
in
my
words
thou
wilt
be
animating
thy
troops
o
that
my
words
may
not
prove
unworthy
of
thy
spirit
i
will
celebrate
both
the
backs
of
the
parthians
as
they
fly
and
the
valour
of
the
romans
and
the
darts
and
the
feelings
and
makes
them
ready
to
be
inflamed
care
flies
and
is
drenched
with
plenteous
wine
then
come
smiles
then
the
poor
man
resumes
his
confidence
then
grief
and
cares
and
the
wrinkles
of
the
forehead
depart
then
candour
most
uncommon
in
our
age
reveals
the
feelings
the
god
expelling
guile
on
such
occasions
full
oft
have
the
fair
captivated
the
hearts
of
the
youths
and
venus
amid
wine
has
proved
flames
in
flame
here
do
not
you
trust
too
much
to
the
deceiving
lamp
both
night
and
wine
are
unsuited
to
a
judgment
upon
beauty
in
daylight
and
under
a
clear
sky
did
paris
view
the
goddesses
when
he
said
to
venus
thou
venus
dost
excel
them
both
by
night
blemishes
are
concealed
and
pardon
is
granted
to
every
imperfection
and
that
hour
renders
every
woman
beauteous
consult
the
daylight
about
jewels
about
wool
steeped
in
purple
consult
the
daylight
about
the
figure
and
the
proportion
why
enumerate
the
resorts
of
fair
ones
suited
for
your
search
the
sands
would
yield
to
my
number
why
mention
baiæ
and
the
shores
covered
with
sails
and
the
waters
which
send
forth
the
smoke
from
the
warm
sulphur
many
a
one
carrying
thence
a
wound
in
his
breast
has
exclaimed
this
water
was
not
so
wholesome
as
it
was
said
to
be
see
too
the
temple
in
the
grove
of
suburban
diana
and
the
realms
acquired
with
the
sword
by
hostile
hand
because
she
is
a
virgin
because
she
hates
the
darts
of
cupid
she
has
given
many
a
wound
to
the
public
will
give
many
thus
far
thalia
borne
upon
unequal
wheels
teaches
where
the
foeman
hurls
from
his
flying
steed
as
stealthy
courtship
is
pleasing
to
the
man
so
too
is
it
to
the
fair
the
man
but
unsuccessfully
conceals
his
passion
with
more
concealment
does
she
desire
were
it
agreed
among
the
males
not
to
be
the
first
to
entreat
any
female
the
conquered
fair
would
soon
act
the
part
of
the
suppliant
in
the
balmy
meads
the
female
lows
after
the
bull
the
female
is
always
neighing
after
the
horse
passion
in
us
is
more
enduring
and
not
so
violent
among
men
the
flame
has
reasonable
bounds
why
mention
byblis
who
burned
with
a
forbidden
passion
for
her
brother
and
who
resolutely
atoned
with
the
halter
for
her
crimes
myrrha
loved
her
father
but
not
as
a
daughter
ought
and
she
now
lies
hid
overwhelmed
by
the
bark
that
grew
over
her
with
her
tears
too
which
she
distils
from
the
odoriferous
tree
are
we
perfumed
and
the
drops
still
retain
the
name
of
their
mistress
by
chance
in
the
shady
vales
of
the
woody
ida
there
was
a
white
hull
the
glory
of
the
herd
marked
with
a
little
black
in
the
middle
between
his
horns
there
was
but
one
spot
the
rest
was
of
the
complexion
of
milk
the
heifers
of
gnossus
and
of
cydon
sighed
to
mate
with
him
pasiphaë
delighted
to
become
the
paramour
of
the
bull
in
her
jealousy
she
hated
the
beauteous
cows
i
sing
of
facts
well
known
crete
which
contains
its
hundred
cities
untruthful
as
it
is
can
not
gainsay
them
she
herself
is
said
to
have
cut
down
fresh
leaves
and
the
tenderest
grass
with
hand
unused
to
such
employment
she
goes
as
the
companion
of
the
herds
so
going
no
regard
for
her
husband
restrains
her
and
by
a
bull
is
minos
conquered
of
what
use
pasiphaë
is
it
to
put
on
those
costly
garments
this
love
of
thine
understands
nothing
about
wealth
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
a
mirror
when
accompanying
the
herds
of
the
mountain
why
foolish
one
art
thou
so
often
arranging
thy
smoothed
locks
still
do
thou
believe
that
mirror
that
denies
that
thou
art
a
heifer
how
much
couldst
thou
wish
for
horns
to
spring
up
upon
thy
forehead
if
minos
still
pleases
thee
let
no
paramour
be
sought
but
if
thou
wouldst
rather
deceive
thy
husband
deceive
him
through
a
being
that
is
human
her
chamber
abandoned
the
queen
is
borne
over
the
groves
and
the
forests
just
as
a
bacchanal
impelled
by
the
aonian
god
alas
how
oft
with
jealous
look
does
she
eye
a
cow
and
say
why
is
she
thus
pleasing
to
my
love
see
how
she
skips
before
him
on
the
tender
grass
i
make
no
doubt
that
the
fool
thinks
that
it
is
becoming
to
her
thus
she
spoke
and
at
once
ordered
her
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
vast
herd
and
in
her
innocence
to
be
dragged
beneath
the
bending
yoke
or
else
she
forced
her
to
fall
before
the
altars
and
rites
feigned
for
the
purpose
and
with
joyous
hand
she
held
the
entrails
of
her
rival
how
often
did
she
propitiate
the
deities
with
her
slain
rivals
and
say
as
she
held
the
entrails
now
go
and
charm
my
love
and
sometimes
she
begged
that
she
might
become
europa
sometimes
io
because
the
one
was
a
cow
the
other
borne
upon
a
bull
still
deceived
by
a
cow
made
of
the
leader
of
the
herd
impregnated
her
and
by
the
offspring
was
the
sire
betrayed
if
the
cretan
dame
had
withheld
from
love
for
thyestes
alas
how
hard
it
is
for
a
woman
possibly
to
be
pleasing
to
one
man
only
phoebus
would
not
have
interrupted
his
career
in
the
midst
and
his
chariot
turned
back
retreated
with
his
returning
steeds
to
the
morn
the
daughter
who
spoiled
nisus
of
his
purple
locks
presses
beneath
her
thigh
and
groin
the
raving
dogs
the
son
of
atreus
who
escaped
from
mars
by
land
and
neptune
on
the
waves
was
the
mournful
victim
of
his
wife
by
whom
have
not
been
lamented
the
flames
of
the
ephyrean
creusa
medea
the
parent
too
stained
with
the
blood
of
her
children
phoenix
the
son
of
amyntor
wept
with
his
blinded
eyes
you
startled
steeds
tore
hippolytus
in
pieces
why
phineus
dost
thou
tear
out
the
eyes
of
thy
guiltless
sons
that
punishment
will
revert
to
thy
own
head
all
these
things
have
been
caused
by
the
passion
of
females
it
is
more
violent
than
ours
and
has
more
frenzy
come
then
and
doubt
not
that
you
can
conquer
all
the
fair
out
of
so
many
there
will
be
hardly
one
to
deny
you
what
they
yield
and
what
they
refuse
still
are
they
glad
to
be
asked
for
even
if
you
are
deceived
your
repulse
is
without
danger
but
why
should
you
be
deceived
since
new
pleasures
are
delightful
and
since
what
is
strange
attracts
the
feelings
more
than
what
is
one
own
the
crop
of
corn
is
always
more
fertile
in
the
fields
of
other
people
and
the
herds
of
our
neighbours
have
their
udders
more
distended
but
first
be
it
your
care
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
handmaid
of
the
fair
one
to
be
courted
she
can
render
your
access
easy
take
care
that
she
is
deep
in
the
secrets
of
her
mistress
and
not
too
little
entrusted
with
her
secret
frolics
her
do
you
bribe
with
promises
her
with
entreaties
you
will
obtain
what
you
ask
with
little
trouble
if
she
shall
be
willing
let
her
choose
the
time
physicians
even
watch
their
time
when
the
feelings
of
her
mistress
are
pliant
and
easy
to
be
influenced
then
will
her
feelings
be
easily
influenced
when
in
the
best
humour
in
the
world
she
shall
be
smiling
just
as
the
corn
on
the
rich
soil
while
hearts
are
joyous
and
not
closed
by
sadness
are
they
assailable
then
with
soothing
arts
does
venus
steal
on
apace
at
the
time
when
troy
was
in
sorrow
she
was
defended
by
arms
when
joyous
she
admitted
the
horse
pregnant
with
its
soldiers
then
too
must
she
be
assailed
when
she
shall
be
fretting
on
being
offended
by
a
rival
then
effect
it
by
your
means
that
she
go
not
unrevenged
let
her
handmaid
as
she
combs
her
hair
in
the
morning
urge
her
on
and
to
the
sail
let
her
add
the
resources
of
the
oar
and
sighing
to
herself
let
her
say
in
gentle
murmurs
in
my
idea
you
yourself
can
not
pay
him
in
return
then
let
her
talk
about
you
then
let
her
add
persuasive
expressions
and
let
her
swear
that
you
are
perishing
with
frantic
passion
but
speed
on
let
not
the
sails
fall
and
the
breezes
lull
like
brittle
ice
anger
disappears
in
lapse
of
time
you
inquire
if
it
is
of
use
to
win
the
handmaid
herself
in
such
attempts
there
is
a
great
risk
this
one
becomes
zealous
after
an
intrigue
that
one
more
tardy
the
one
procures
you
as
a
gift
for
her
mistress
the
other
for
her
own
self
the
result
is
doubtful
although
she
should
favour
your
advances
still
it
is
my
advice
to
refrain
from
so
doing
i
shall
not
go
over
headlong
and
over
sharp
crags
and
under
my
guidance
no
youth
shall
be
deceived
even
if
she
pleases
you
while
she
gives
and
receives
the
letters
by
her
person
and
not
only
by
her
zealousness
alone
take
care
and
gain
her
mistress
first
let
the
other
follow
as
her
companion
your
courtship
must
not
be
commenced
with
a
this
one
thing
i
advise
you
if
you
only
put
some
trust
in
my
skill
and
if
the
boisterous
wind
does
not
bear
my
words
over
the
seas
either
do
not
attempt
or
else
do
you
persist
the
informer
is
removed
when
once
she
herself
has
shared
in
the
criminality
the
bird
does
not
easily
escape
when
its
wings
are
the
boar
does
not
readily
get
away
from
the
loose
nets
the
wounded
fish
can
be
held
by
the
hook
it
has
seized
once
tried
press
her
hard
and
do
not
retreat
but
as
the
conqueror
then
guilty
of
a
fault
that
is
common
to
you
both
she
will
not
betray
you
and
the
sayings
and
doings
of
her
mistress
will
be
well
known
to
you
but
let
this
be
well
concealed
if
your
informant
shall
be
well
concealed
your
mistress
will
ever
be
under
your
eye
he
is
mistaken
who
supposes
that
time
is
the
object
of
those
only
who
till
the
fields
and
is
to
be
observed
by
mariners
alone
neither
must
the
corn
be
always
trusted
to
the
treacherous
soil
nor
the
hollow
ships
at
all
times
to
the
green
waves
nor
is
it
safe
to
be
ever
angling
for
the
charming
fair
the
same
thing
may
often
be
better
done
when
an
opportunity
offers
whether
it
is
her
birthday
that
comes
or
whether
the
calends
which
venus
delights
to
have
as
the
successor
of
the
month
of
mars
or
whether
the
circus
shall
be
adorned
not
with
statues
as
it
was
before
but
shall
be
containing
the
wealth
of
kings
exposed
to
view
delay
your
project
then
the
storm
is
boisterous
then
the
pleiades
prevail
then
the
tender
kid
is
sinking
in
the
ocean
wave
then
is
well
to
desist
then
if
one
trusts
the
deep
with
difficulty
he
grasps
the
shipwrecked
fragments
of
his
dismantled
bark
you
may
make
a
beginning
on
the
day
on
which
tearful
allia
was
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
latian
wounds
on
the
day
too
when
the
festival
recurs
observed
each
seventh
day
by
the
syrian
of
palestine
a
day
not
suited
for
the
transaction
of
business
great
must
be
your
dread
of
the
birthday
of
your
mistress
and
unlucky
be
that
day
on
which
any
present
must
be
made
though
you
should
cleverly
avoid
her
still
she
will
spoil
you
a
woman
finds
contrivances
by
means
of
which
to
plunder
the
riches
of
the
eager
lover
the
pedlar
will
be
coming
to
your
mistress
so
fond
of
buying
and
while
you
are
by
will
be
exposing
his
wares
she
wills
ask
you
to
examine
them
only
that
you
may
appear
to
be
knowing
then
she
will
give
you
a
kiss
and
then
entreat
you
to
purchase
she
will
swear
that
she
will
be
content
with
this
for
many
a
year
she
will
say
that
now
she
has
need
of
it
now
it
may
be
bought
a
bargain
if
you
shall
make
the
excuse
that
you
have
not
the
money
at
home
to
give
a
promissory
note
will
be
asked
for
it
would
then
profit
you
not
to
have
learned
to
write
besides
too
when
she
asks
for
a
present
as
though
for
the
cake
and
is
born
for
her
own
pleasure
as
often
as
she
pleases
and
further
when
full
of
tears
she
laments
her
pretended
loss
and
the
jewel
is
feigned
to
have
fallen
from
her
pierced
ear
they
ask
for
many
a
sum
to
be
lent
them
so
lent
they
have
no
inclination
to
return
them
you
lose
the
whole
and
no
thanks
are
there
for
your
loss
had
i
ten
mouths
with
tongues
as
many
they
would
not
suffice
for
me
to
recount
the
abominable
contrivances
of
courtesans
let
the
wax
that
is
poured
upon
the
polished
tablets
first
try
the
ford
let
the
wax
first
go
as
the
messenger
of
your
feelings
let
it
carry
your
compliments
and
whoever
you
are
add
expressions
that
feign
you
to
be

love

entreaties

in

any
person
whatever
can
be

if
she
is
only
once
cherished
holds
out
for
a
long
time
she
is
indeed
a
deceitful
goddess
but
still
a
convenient
one
should
you
give
her
anything
you
may
for
that
reason
be
abandoned
by
her
she
will
bear
off
the
gift
and
will
have
lost
nothing
in
return
but
that
which
you
have
not
given
you
may
always
seem
as
though
about
to
give
thus
has
the
sterile
field
full
oft
deceived
its
owner
so
the
gambler
in
order
that
he
may
not
lose
does
not
cease
to
lose
and
the
alluring
dice
ever
recall
the
anxious
hand
this
is
the
task
this
the
labour
to
gain
her
without
even
the
first
present
what
she
has
once
given
she
will
always
give
that
she
may
not
have
granted
to
no
purpose
let
the
letter
go
then
and
let
it
be
couched
in
tender
expressions
and
let
it
ascertain
her
feelings
and
be
the
first
to
feel
its
way
a
letter

judge
and
the
silent
senate
as
well
as
the
fair
conquered
by
your
eloquence
shall
extend
their
hands
but
let
your
power
lie
concealed
and
do
not
be
eloquent
at
the
first
let
your
letters
avoid
difficult
words
who
but
one
bereft
of
sense
would
declaim
before
a
charming
mistress
full
oft
has
a
letter
proved
a
powerful
cause
for
hatred
let
your
language
be
intelligible
and
your
words
the
usual
ones
but
pleasing
so
that
you
may
seem
to
be
speaking
in
person
should
she
not
accept
your
letter
and
send
it
back
unread
hope
that
she
will
read
it
and
persist
in
your
design
in
time
the
stubborn
oxen
come
beneath
the
ploughs
in
time
the
steeds
are
taught
to
submit
to
the
flowing
reins
by
continued
use
the
ring
of
iron
is
consumed
by
being
in
the
ground
continually
the
crooked
plough
is
worn
out
what
is
there
harder
than
stone
what
more
yielding
than
water
yet
hard
stones
are
hollowed
out
by
yielding
water
only
persist
and
in
time
you
will
overcome
penelope
herself
you
see
that
pergamus
was
taken
after
a
long
time
still
it
was
taken
if
she
reads
it
and
will
not
write
in
answer
do
not
attempt
to
compel
her
do
you
only
make
her
to
be
continually
reading
your
flattering
lines
what
she
has
been
pleased
to
read
she
will
be
pleased
to
answer
when
read
these
things
will
come
in
their
turn
and
by
degrees
perhaps
even
at
first
a
discouraging
letter
will
come
to
you
and
one
that
entreats
you
not
to
wish
to
molest
her
what
she
entreats
you
she
dreads
what
she
does
not
entreat
you
do
to
persist
she
wishes
you
press
on
and
soon
you
will
be
the
gainer
of
your
desires
in
the
meantime
if
she
shall
be
carried
lying
along
upon
her
couch
do
you
as
though
quite
by
accident
approach
the
litter
of
your
mistress
and
that
no
one
may
give
a
mischievous
ear
to
your
words
cunningly
conceal
them
so
far
as
you
can
in
doubtful
signs
if
with
sauntering
foot
the
spacious
portico
is
paced
by
her
here
too
do
you
bestow
your
leisure
in
her
attendance
and
sometimes
do
you
take
care
to
go
before
sometimes
follow
behind
and
sometimes
be
in
a
hurry
and
sometimes
walk
leisurely
and
be
not
ashamed
to
pass
from
the
throng
under
some
of
the
columns
or
to
walk
with
her
side
by
side
and
let
her
not
be
seated
long
without
you
in
the
curving
theatre
in
her
shoulders
she
will
bring
something
for
you
to
be
spectator
of
her
you
may
gaze
upon
her
you
may
admire
much
may
you
say
by
your
brows
much
by
your
gestures

the
actor
is
dancing
in

of
some
damsel

as
long
as

employ
your

at

of
your

let
it
not

you
to
curl
your
hair
with
the
irons
and
rub
not
your
legs
with
the
rough
pumice
bid
those

this
in

bacchus

flame
with
which
he
burns
himself
the
gnossian
fair
was
wandering
distractedly
on
the
unknown
sands
where
little
dia
is
beaten
by
the
ocean
waves
and
just
as
she
was
from
her
sleep
clothed
in
a
loose
tunic
with
bare
feet
and
having
her
yellow
hair
loose
she
was
exclaiming
to
the
deaf
waves
that
theseus
was
cruel
while
the
piteous
shower
of
tears
was
moistening
her
tender
cheeks
she
exclaimed
and
at
the
same
moment
she
wept
but
both
became
her
nor
was
she
rendered
unsightly
by
her
tears
and
now
again
beating
her
most
beauteous
bosom
with
her
hands
she
cried
that
perfidious
man
has
gone
what
will
become
of
me
what
will
become
of
me
she
said
when
cymbals
resounded
over
all
the
shore
and
tambourines
were
beaten
with
frantic
hand
she
dropped
down
with
alarm
and
stopped
short
in
her
closing
words
and
no
blood
was
there
in
her
lifeless
body
see
the
mimallonian
females
with
their
locks
flowing
on
their
backs
see
the
nimble
satyrs
the
throng
preceding
the
god
sec
silenus
the
drunken
old
man
on
his
bending
ass
sits
there
with
difficulty
and
holds
fast
by
the
mane
that
he
presses
while
he
follows
the
bacchanals
the
bacchanals
both
fly
and
return
while
the
unskilful
rider
is
goading
on
his
animal
with
his
stick
slipping
from
the
ass
he
tumbles
upon
his
head
the
satyrs
cry
aloud
come
rise
up
rise
father
now
the
god
from
his
chariot
the
top
of
which
he
had
wreathed
with
grapes
loosened
the
golden
reins
for
the
tigers
yoked
to
it
both
her
complexion
and
theseus
and
her
voice
forsook
the
fair
one
and
thrice
she
attempted
flight
and
thrice
was
she
detained
by
fear
she
shuddered
just
as
the
barren
ears
of
corn
which
the
wind
shakes
just
as
the
slender
reed
quivers
in
the
swampy
marsh
to
her
the
divinity
said
lo
i
come
to
thee
a
more
constant
lover
damsel
of
gnossus
lay
aside
thy
fear
the
wife
of
bacchus
shalt
thou
be
receive
heaven
as
my
gift
a
conspicuous
constellation
in
the
heavens
full
oft
cretan
diadem
shalt
thou
direct
the
veering
bark
thus
he
said
and
he
leapt
from
the
chariot
that
she
might
not
be
in
dread
of
the
tigers
the
sand
yielded
to
his
foot
placed
upon
it
and
folding
her
in
his
bosom
he
bore
her
off
for
to
struggle
she
was
unable
how
easy
is
for
a
god
to
be
able
to
do
anything
some
sing
hymenæus
some
cry
evie
evoë
thus
are
the
god
and
his
bride
united
in
holy
wedlock
therefore
when
the
gifts
of
bacchus
placed
before
you
fall
to
your
lot
and
the
fair
one
shall
be
a
sharer
in
the
convivial
couch
pray
both
to
father
nyctelius
and
his
nocturnal
rites
that
they
will
bid
the
wine
not
to
take
effect
on
your
head
here
in
secret
discourse
you
may
say
to
her
many
a
free
word
which
she
may
understand
is
addressed
to
her
and
you
may
trace
out
short
compliments
with
a
little
wine
so
that
she
may
read
on
the
table
that
she
is
your
favorite
and
look
on
her
eyes
with
eyes
that
confess
your
flame
the
silent
features
often
have
both
words
and
expression
take
care
to
be
the
next
to
seize
the
cup
that
has
been
touched
by
her
lips
and
drink
from
the
side
that
the
fair
drinks
from
and
whatever
food
she
shall
have
touched
with
her
fingers
do
you
reach
for
it
and
while
you
are
reaching
her
hand
may
be
touched
by
you
let
it
also
be
your
object
to
please
the
husband
of
the
fair
made
a
friend
he
will
be
more
serviceable
for
your
designs
if
you
are
drinking
by
lot
grant
him
the
first
turn
let
the
chaplet
taken
from
your
own
head
be
presented
to
him
whether
he
is
below
you
or
whether
your
neighbour
let
him
help
himself
to
every
thing
first
and
do
not
hesitate
to
speak
only
after
he
has
spoken
secure
and
much
frequented
is
the
path
for
deceiving
through
the
name
of
friendship
secure
and
much
frequented
though
that
path
be
it
is
to
be
condemned
for
this
cause
is
that
the
agent
attends
even
too
much
to
his
agency
and
thinks
that
more
things
ought
to
be
looked
after
by
him
than
those
entrusted
to
him
a
sure
rule
for
drinking
shall
be
given
you
by
me
let
both
your
mind
and
your
feet
ever
observe
their
duty
especially
avoid
quarrels
stimulated
by
wine
and
hands
too
ready
for
savage
warfare
eurytion
met
his
death
from
foolishly
quaffing
the
wine
set
before
him
banquets
and
wine
are
rather
suited
for
pleasant
mirth
if
you
have
a
voice
sing
if
pliant
arms
dance
and
by
whatever
talent
you
can
amuse
amuse
as
real
drunkenness
offends
so
feigned
will
prove
of
service
let
your
deceiving
tongue
stutter
with
lisping
accents
so
that
whatever
you
shall
do
or
say
with
more
freedom
than
usual
it
may
be
supposed
that
excess
of
wine
is
the
cause
and
express
all
good
wishes
for
your
mistress
all
good
wishes
for
him
who
shares
her
couch
but
in
your
silent
thoughts
pray
for
curses
on
her
husband
but
when
the
tables
removed
the
guests
shall
be
going
the
very
crowd
will
afford
you
access
and
room
mix
in
the
throng
and
quietly
stealing
up
to
her
as
she
walks
twitch
her
side
with
your
fingers
and
touch
her
foot
with
your
foot
now
is
the
time
come
for
some
conversation
fly
afar
hence
coy
bashfulness
let
chance
and
venus
befriend
the
daring
let
your
eloquence
not
be
subject
to
any
laws
of
mine
only
make
a
beginning
of
your
own
accord
you
will
prove
fluent
you
must
act
the
lover
and
wounds
must
be
feigned
in
your
words
hence
let
confidence
be
sought
by
you
by
means
of
any
contrivances
whatever
and
is
no
hard
matter
to
be
believed
each
woman
seems
to
herself
worthy
to
be
loved
though
she
be
ugly
in
the
extreme
to
no
one
are
her
own
looks
displeasing
yet
often
he
that
pretends
to
love
begins
in
reality
full
oft
he
becomes
that
which
in
the
beginning
he
feigned
to
be
for
this
cause
the
rather
o
ye
fair
be
propitious
to
those
who
pretend
that
passion
will
become
real
which
so
lately
was
feigned
now
be
it
your
part
stealthily
to
captivate
her
affection
by
attentions
just
as
the
shelving
bank
is
encroached
on
by
the
flowing
stream
be
not
tired
of
praising
either
her
face
or
her
hair
her
taper
fingers
too
and
her
small
foot
the
praise
of
their
beauty
pleases
even
the
chaste
their
charms
are
the
care
and
the
pleasure
of
even
maidens
for
why
even
now
are
juno
and
pallas
ashamed
at
not
having
gained
the
decision
in
the
phrygian
groves
the
bird
of
juno
exposes
her
feathers
when
praised
if
you
look
at
them
in
silence
she
conceals
her
treasures
amid
the
contests
of
the
rapid
course
their
trimmed
manes
and
their
patted
necks
delight
the
steeds
promise
too
without
hesitation
promises
attract
the
fair
make
any
gods
you
please
to
be
witnesses
of
what
you
promise
jupiter
from
on
high
smiles
at
the
perjuries
of
lovers
and
commands
the
æolian
south
winds
to
sweep
them
away
as
worthless
jupiter
was
accustomed
to
swear
falsely
to
juno
by
the
styx
now
is
he
himself
indulgent
to
his
own
precedent
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
gods
and
as
it
is
expedient
let
us
believe
them
to
exist
let
frankincense
and
wine
be
presented
on
their
ancient
altars
no
repose
free
from
care
and
similar
to
sleep
possesses
them
live
in
innocence
for
a
divinity
is
ever
present
restore
the
pledge
let
piety
observe
her
duties
be
there
no
fraud
keep
your
hands
free
from
bloodshed
deceive
if
you
are
wise
the
fair
alone
with
impunity
for
this
one
piece
of
deceit
only
is
good
faith
to
be
disregarded
deceive
the
deceivers
in
a
great
measure
they
are
all
a
guilty
race
let
them
fall
into
the
toils
which
they
have
spread
egypt
is
said
to
have
been
without
showers
that
refresh
the
fields
and
to
have
been
parched
during
nine
years
when
thrasius
went
to
busiris
and
showed
that
jupiter
could
be
propitiated
by
shedding
the
blood
of
strangers
to
him
busiris
said
thou
shalt
become
the
first
sacrifice
to
jove
and
a
stranger
thou
shalt
produce
rain
for
egypt
phalaris
too
burnt
in
the
bull
the
limbs
of
the
cruel
perillus
the
unhappy
inventor
was
the
first
to
make
proof
of
his
work
each
of
them
was
just
and
indeed
no
law
is
there
more
righteous
than
that
the
contrivers
of
death
should
perish
by
their
own
contrivances
therefore
since
perjuries
with
justice
impose
upon
the
perjured
let
woman
grieve
deceived
through
a
precedent
her
own
tears
too
are
of
utility
by
tears
you
will
move
adamant
make
her
if
you
can
to
see
your
moistened
cheeks
if
tears
shall
fail
you
for
indeed
they
do
not
always
come
in
time
touch
your
eyes
with
your
wet
hand
what
discreet
person
would
not
mingle
kisses
with
tender
words
though
she
should
not
grant
them
still
take
them
ungranted
perhaps
she
will
struggle
at
first
and
will
say
you
naughty
man
still
in
her
struggling
she
will
wish
to
be
overcome
only
let
them
not
rudely
snatched
hurt
her
tender
lips
and
take
care
that
she
may
not
be
able
to
complain
that
they
have
proved
a
cause
of
pain
he
who
has
gained
kisses
if
he
can
not
gain
the
rest
as
well
will
deserve
to
lose
even
that
which
has
been
granted
him
how
much
is
there
wanting
for
unlimited
enjoyment
after
a
kiss
oh
shocking
clownishness
and
not
modesty
call
it
violence
if
you
like
such
violence
is
pleasing
to
the
fair
they
often
wish
through
compulsion
to
grant
what
they
are
delighted
whatever
fair
one
has
been
despoiled
by
the
sudden
violence
of
passion
she
is
delighted
at
it
and
the
chief
is
as
good
as
a
godsend
but
she
who
when
she
might
have
been
carried
by
storm
has
escaped
untouched
though
in
her
features
she
should
pretend
gladness
will
be
sorry
phoebe

violence

violence

and
pleasing

the
damsel
of

a
story
indeed

not
unworthy
to
be
related

a

had

to

by

believe
but
still
by
force
was
she
willing
to
be
overcome
many
a
time
did
she
say
stay
when
now
achilles
was
hastening
for
the
distaff
laid
aside
he
had
assumed
valiant
arms
where
now
is
this
violence
why
with
gentle
voice
deidamia
dost
thou
detain
the
perpetrator
of
thy
disgrace
as
forsooth
there
is
shame
in
first
beginning
at
any
time
so
is
pleasing
the
to
submit
when
the
other
takes
the
initiative
alas
too
great
is
the
confidence
of
any
youth
in
his
own
good
looks
if
he
awaits
for
her
to
be
the
first
to
ask
him
let
the
man
make
the
first
approaches
let
the
man
use
words
of
entreaty
she
will
kindly
receive
his
soft
entreaties
to
gain
ask
only
wishes
to
be
tell
her
the
cause
and
the
origin
of
your
desires
jupiter
came
as
a
suppliant
to
the
heroines
of
olden
times
no
fair
one
found
fault
with
great
jove
but
if
you
perceive
vanity
to
be
the
result
of
your
prayers
desist
from
your
design
and
withhold
your
advances
many
desire
that
which
flies
from
them
and
hate
that
which
is
close
at
hand
by
pressing
on
less
eagerly
remove
all
weariness
of
yourself
nor
must
your
hope
of
enjoyment
be
always
confessed
by
you
as
you
entreat
let
love
make
his
entrance
concealed
beneath
the
name
of
friendship
by
this
introduction
i
have
seen
the
prudish
fair
deceived
he
who
was
the
friend
became
the
lover
a
fair
complexion
is
unbecoming
in
a
sailor
he
ought
to
be
swarthy
from
the
spray
of
the
sea
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
it
is
unbecoming
too
to
the
husbandman
who
with
his
crooked
plough
and
his
heavy
harrows
is
always
turning
up
the
ground
in
the
open
air
and
if
your
body
is
fair
you
by
whom
the
glory
of
the
chaplet
of
pallas
is
sought
you
will
be
unsightly
let
every
one
that
is
in
love
be
pale
that
is
the
proper
complexion
for
one
in
love
that
is
becoming
from
your
features
let
the
fair
think
that
you
are
not
in
good
health
pale
with
love
for
lyrice
did
orion
wander
in
the
woods
pale
for
the
naiad
in
her
indifference
was
daphnis
thinness
too
shows
the
feelings
and
think
it
no
disgrace
to
put
a
hood
over
your
shining
looks
let
sleepless
nights
attenuate
the
bodies
of
the
youths
care
too
and
the
grief
that
proceeds
from
violent
love
that
you
may
gain
your
desires
be
wretched
that
he
who
sees
you
may
be
able
to
say
you
are
in
love
shall
i
complain
or
remind
you
how
all
right
and
wrong
is
confused
friendship
is
but
a
name
constancy
an
empty
title
alas
alas
it
is
not
safe
to
praise
the
object
that
you
love
to
your
friend
when
he
has
credited
your
praises
he
supplants
you
but
the
descendant
of
actor
did
not
defile
the
couch
of
achilles
so
far
as
pirithous
was
concerned
phædra
was
chaste
pylades
loved
hermione
with
the
affection
with
which
phoebus
loved
pallas
and
he
was
such
daughter
of
tyndarus
as
thy
twin
brother
castor
was
towards
thee
if
any
one
expects
the
same
let
him
expect
that
the
tamarisks
will
bear
apples
and
let
him
look
for
honey
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
nothing
pleases
but
what
is
base
his
own
gratification
is
the
object
of
each
this
too
becomes
pleasant
from
the
sorrow
of
another
oh
disgraceful
conduct
no
enemy
is
to
be
dreaded
by
the
lover
shun
those
whom
you
think
trustworthy
then
you
will
be
safe
shun
your
kinsman
and
your
brother
and
your
dear
friend
this
class
will
cause
you
real
alarm
i
was
about
to
conclude
but
there
are
various
dispositions
in
the
fair
treat
these
thousand
dispositions
in
a
thousand
ways
the
same
soil
does
not
produce
everything
one
suits
the
vine
another
the
olive
in
this
corn
springs
up
vigorously
there
are
as
many
characters
in
these
various
dispositions
as
there
are
forms
in
the
world
the
man
that
is
wise
will
adapt
himself
to
these
innumerable
characters
and
as
at
one
moment
proteus
will
make
himself
flow
in
running
water
and
now
will
be
a
lion
now
a
tree
now
a
shaggy
goat
these
fish
are
taken
with
a
dart
those
with
hooks
these
the
encircling
nets
draw
up
the
rope
being
extended
and
let
no
one
method
be
adopted
by
you
for
all
years
the
aged
hind
will
espy
from
a
greater
distance
your
contrivances
should
you
seem
learned
to
the
ignorant
or
forward
to
the
bashful
she
will
at
once
distrust
herself
now
apprehensive
thence
it
happens
that
she
who
has
dreaded
to
trust
herself
to
the
man
falls
into
the
embrace
of
some
worthless
inferior
a
part
remains
of
the
task
which
i
have
undertaken
a
part
is
completed
here
let
the
anchor
thrown
out
hold
fast
my
bark
book
the
second
io
pæan
and
io
pæan
twice
sing
the
prey
that
was
sought
has
fallen
into
our
toils
let
the
joyous
lover
present
my
lines
with
the
verdant
palm
to
the
ascræan
and
to
the
mæonian
old
man
shall
i
be
preferred
such
did
the
stranger
son
of
priam
set
his
whitening
sails
from
the
armed
amyclæ
together
with
the
ravished
wife
such
was
he
who
bore
thee
hippodamia
in
his
victorious
chariot
carried
by
the
wheels
of
the
stranger
why
hasten
then
young
man
thy
ship
is
sailing
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
and
far
distant
is
the
harbour
for
which
i
make
it
is
not
enough
me
your
poet
for
the
fair
to
be
gained
by
you
through
my
skill
has
she
been
acquired
through
my
skill
must
she
be
retained
is
no
less
merit
to
keep
what
is
acquired
than
to
gain
it
in
the
former
there
is
some
chance
in
the
latter
will
be
a
work
of
art
now
if
ever
boy
and
cytherea
be
propitious
now
erato
for
thou
hast
a
name
from
love
great
attempts
do
i
contemplate
to
tell
by
what
means
love
can
be
arrested
the
boy
that
wanders
over
the
world
so
wide
he
is
both
inconstant
and
he
has
two
wings
with
which
to
fly
is
an
arduous
task
to
impose
laws
on
these
minos
had
obstructed
all
means
of
escape
to
the
stranger
he
discovered
a
bold
path
with
his
wings
when
dædalus
had
enclosed
the
man
and
the
bull
that
was
conceived
in
the
criminality
of
his
mother
he
said
most
just
minos
let
there
be
a
termination
of
my
exile
and
let
my
paternal
land
receive
my
ashes
and
since
harassed
by
the
cruel
destinies
i
can
not
live
in
my
country
let
me
be
enabled
to
die
if
the
merits
of
an
old
man
are
but
small
grant
a
return
to
this
boy
if
thou
art
unwilling
to
favour
the
boy
then
favour
the
old
man
this
he
said
but
both
this
and
many
more
things
he
might
have
said
the
other
did
not
permit
a
return
to
the
hero
soon
as
he
saw
this
he
said
now
o
now
dædalus
thou
hast
a
subject
upon
which
thou
mayst
prove
ingenious
lo
minos
possesses
the
land
and
he
possesses
the
ocean
neither
earth
nor
water
is
open
for
our
escape
there
remains
a
path
through
the
heavens
through
the
heavens
will
we
attempt
to
go
jupiter
on
high
grant
pardon
to
my
design
i
do
not
aim
to
reach
the
starry
abodes
there
is
no
way
but
this
one
by
which
i
may
escape
the
tyrant
should
a
road
through
styx
be
granted
then
we
will
swim
through
the
stygian
waves
let
the
laws
of
nature
be
changed
by
me
often
sharpen
the
who
could
have
ever
believed
that
a
mortal
could
attempt
the
paths
of
the
air
he
arranges
swift
feathers
in
order
like
oars
and
connects
the
light
work
with
fastenings
of
thread
the
lower
part
too
is
bound
together
with
wax
melted
by
the
fire
and
now
the
work
of
the
new
contrivance
is
finished
the
smiling
boy
handles
both
the
wax
and
the
feathers
not
knowing
that
these
instruments
are
prepared
for
his
own
shoulders
to
him
his
father
says
with
these
ships
must
we
reach
our
native
land
by
these
means
must
we
escape
from
minos
the
air
minos
could
not
all
else
he
has
shut
against
us
cleave
the
air
which
still
thou
mayst
with
these
my
inventions
but
neither
the
virgin
of
tegeæa
nor
the
orion
the
companion
of
bootes
will
have
to
be
beheld
by
thee
follow
me
with
the
wings
given
to
thee
i
will
go
before
on
the
way
be
it
thy
care
to
follow
me
thy
leader
thou
wilt
he
safe
but
if
we
shall
go
through
the
air
of
the
heavens
the
sun
close
to
us
the
wax
will
not
be
able
to
endure
the
heat
if
we
shall
wave
our
wings
below
the
sea
near
to
us
the
fluttering
feathers
will
be
wet
with
the
ocean
spray
fly
between
them
both
dread
too
the
winds
my
son
and
whichever
way
the
breezes
shall
blow
set
thy
prospering
sails
while
he
thus
advises
he
fits
his
work
on
to
the
boy
and
shows
how
it
is
to
be
moved
just
as
their
mother
teaches
the
helpless
birds
then
he
places
upon
his
shoulders
the
wings
made
for
himself
and
with
timidity
he
poises
his
body
along
this
new
track
and
now
about
to
fly
he
gives
kisses
to
his
little
son
and
the
cheeks
of
the
father
do
not
withhold
their
tears
there
is
a
hill
less
than
a
mountain
more
lofty
than
the
level
plain
hence
are
their
two
bodies
entrusted
to
their
mournful
flight
dædalus
both
moves
his
own
wings
himself
and
looks
back
on
those
of
his
son
and
he
ever
keeps
on
his
own
course
and
now
this
unusual
path
delights
him
and
fear
laid
aside
icarus
flies
more
courageously
with
emboldened
skill
a
person
sees
them
while
he
is
angling
for
fish
with
his
quivering
rod
and
his
right
hand
desists
from
the
work
he
has
commenced
now
samos
and
naxos
had
been
left
behind
on
the
left
hand
and
paros
and
delos
beloved
by
the
clarian
god
lebynthos
was
to
the
right
and
calymne
shaded
with
its
woods
and
astypalæa
surrounded
with
its
fishy
shallows
when
the
boy
too
venturesome
in
his
inconsiderate
daring
took
a
higher
flight
and
forsook
his
guide
the
fastenings
give
way
and
the
wax
melts
the
divinity
being
so
near
and
his
arms
when
moved
no
longer
catch
the
light
breeze
alarmed
he
looks
down
upon
the
sea
from
the
lofty
heavens
darkness
arising
from
trembling
apprehension
comes
over
his
eyes
the
wax
has
now
melted
he
waves
his
bare
arms
and
he
trembles
and
has
no
means
whereby
to
be
supported
downward
he
falls
and
as
he
falls
he
cries
father
o
father
i
am
undone
as
he
spoke
the
azure
waves
closed
his
mouth
but
the
unhappy
father
a
father
now
no
longer
cried
aloud
icarus
where
art
thou
or
under
what
part
of
the
sky
dost
thou
fly
icarus
again
he
cried
aloud
his
feathers
he
beheld
in
the
waves
the
dry
land
covers
his
bones
the
sea
retains
his
name
minos
could
not
restrain
the
wings
of
a
mortal
i
myself
am
attempting
to
arrest
a
winged
divinity
if
any
one
has
recourse
to
the
hæmonian
arts
and
gives
that
which
he
has
torn
from
the
forehead
of
the
young
horse
he
is
mistaken
the
herbs
of
medea
will
not
cause
love
to
endure
nor
yet
the
marsian
spells
mingled
with
the
magic
notes
the
phasian
damsel
would
have
retained
the
son
of
æson
circe
ulysses
if
love
could
only
have
been
preserved
through
incantations
philtres
too
causing
paleness
are
of
no
use
when
administered
to
the
fair
philtres
injure
the
intellect
and
have
a
maddening
effect
afar
be
all
criminal
attempts
to
be
loved
be
worthy
to
be
loved
which
comeliness
or
beauty
alone
will
not
confer
upon
you
though
you
should
be
nireus
be
praised
by
ancient
homer
and
the
charming
hylas
carried
off
by
the
criminality
of
the
naiads
that
you
may
retain
your
mistress
and
not
have
to
wonder
that
you
are
deserted
add
the
endowments
of
the
mind
to
the
advantages
of
the
person
beauty
is
a
fleeting
advantage
and
the
more
it
increases
in
years
the
less
it
becomes
and
itself
is
consumed
by
length
of
time
neither
the
violets
nor
the
opening
lilies
bloom
for
ever
and
the
roses
lost
the
thorny
bush
is
prickly
left
behind
and
handsome
man
soon
shall
come
to
you
the
hoary
locks
soon
shall
come
the
wrinkles
to
furrow
your
body
over
now
form
a
disposition
which
may
be
lasting
and
add
it
to
your
beauty
that
alone
endures
to
the
closing
pile
and
be
it
no
light
care
to
cultivate
the
mind
with
the
liberal
arts
and
to
learn
thoroughly
the
two
languages
latin
and
the
ulysses
was
not
handsome
but
he
was
fluent
and
yet
with
love
he
racked
the
ocean
goddesses
ah
how
oft
did
calypso
grieve
at
his
hastening
to
depart
and
declare
that
the
waves
were
not
favorable
to
his
oars
again
and
again
did
she
enquire
into
the
catastrophe
of
troy
often
in
another
manner
was
he
wont
to
repeat
the
same
thing
on
the
shore
they
were
standing
even
there
did
the
beauteous
calypso
enquire
about
the
death
of
the
odrysian
chief
with
a
little
stick
for
by
chance
he
was
holding
a
stick
he
depicted
on
the
firm
shore
the
subject
on
which
she
was
enquiring
this
is
troy
said
he
and
the
walls
he
drew
on
the
shore
this
must
be
simois
for
thee
and
suppose
these
to
be
my
tents
there
was
a
plain
and
here
he
drew
the
plain
which
we
moistened
with
the
blood
of
dolon
while
as
a
spy
he
was
longing
for
the
hæmonian
horses
there
were
the
tents
of
the
sithonian
rhesus
in
this
direction
was
i
borne
back
again
by
the
captured
steeds
and
many
other
things
was
he
depicting
when
the
waves
suddenly
carried
off
both
pergamus
and
the
tents
of
rhesus
together
with
their
chief
then
the
goddess
said
dost
thou
behold
how
famous
names
these
waves
have
swept
away
which
thou
dost
trust
will
be
favorable
to
thee
about
to
depart
come
then
with
hesitation
feel
confidence
in
beauty
so
deceiving
whoever
you
are
or
else
possess
something
of
more
value
than
comeliness
a
beseeming
courtesy
especially
enlists
the
feelings
rudeness
and
harsh
language
promote
hatred
we
dislike
the
hawk
because
it
is
always
living
in
warfare
the
wolves
too
that
are
wont
to
rush
upon
the
startled
flocks
but
the
swallow
because
it
is
gentle
is
exempt
from
the
snares
of
men
and
the
chaonian
bird
has
the
turrets
for
it
to
inhabit
afar
lie
all
strife
and
contentions
of
the
abusive
tongue
with
sweet
words
must
gentle
love
be
cherished
with
strife
let
both
wives
persecute
their
husbands
and
husbands
their
wives
and
each
in
their
turn
let
them
ever
be
thinking
that
they
must
resort
to
law
this
is
the
part
of
wives
strife
is
the
dowry
of
the
wife
let
the
mistress
ever
hear
the
accents
that
she
longs
for
at
the
bidding
of
no
law
have
you
come
to
live
together
in
your
case
is
love
that
performs
the
duties
of
the
law
bring
soft
caresses
and
words
that
delight
the
ear
that
she
may
be
joyous
at
your
approach
i
do
not
come
as
the
instructor
of
the
wealthy
in
love
he
who
makes
presents
has
no
need
of
my
experience
he
who
says
whenever
he
pleases
accept
this
has
a
genius
of
his
own
to
him
do
i
yield
he
has
greater
attractions
than
have
any
discoveries
of
mine
i
am
the
instructor
of
the
poor
because
as
a
poor
man
i
have
been
in
love
when
i
could
not
give
presents
i
gave
verses
let
the
poor
man
love
with
caution
let
the
poor
man
stand
in
fear
of
bad
language
and
let
him
up
with
many
a
thing
not
to
be
endured
by
the
i
remember
that
once
when
in
a
rage
i
disarranged
the
hair
of
my
mistress
of
how
many
a
day
did
that
anger
deprive
me
i
do
not
think
i
did
and
i
did
not
see
that
i
had
torn
her
tunic
but
she
said
so
and
at
my
cost
it
was
replaced
but
you
who
are
wise
avoid
the
errors
of
your
instructor
and
stand
in
awe
of
the
punishment
of
my
transgressions
let
battles
be
with
the
parthians
but
be
there
peace
with
your
refined
mistress
mirth
too
and
whatever
besides
contains
a
reason
for
love
if
she
is
not
sufficiently
kind
or
affable
to
you
her
lover
have
patience
and
bear
it
after
a
time
she
will
be
softened
by
giving
way
the
supple
branch
is
bent
from
the
tree
if
you
make
trial
of
your
strength
you
break
it
by
giving
way
the
waves
are
swam
across
but
you
can
not
overcome
the
stream
if
you
swim
the
which
the
tide
carries
down
is
yielding
that
subdues
the
tigers
and
the
numidian
lions
by
degrees
only
does
the
bull
submit
to
the
rustic
plough
what
was
there
more
coy
than
atalanta
of
nonacris
yet
untamed
as
she
was
she
yielded
to
the
deserving
qualities
of
a
man
they
say
that
many
a
time
beneath
the
trees
milanion
wept
at
his
mishaps
and
the
unkind
conduct
of
the
fair
one
full
oft
on
his
neck
as
ordered
did
he
bear
the
treacherous
toils
full
oft
with
his
cruel
spear
did
he
transfix
the
savage
boars
wounded
too
he
experienced
the
stretched
bow
of
hylæus
but
yet
there
was
another
bow
still
more
felt
than
this
i
do
not
bid
you
in
arms
to
climb
the
woods
of
mænalus
and
i
do
not
bid
you
to
carry
the
toils
upon
your
neck
nor
yet
do
i
bid
you
to
expose
your
breast
to
the
discharged
arrows
the
requirements
of
my
skill
will
be
but
light
to
the
careful
man
yield
to
her
when
opposing
by
yielding
you
will
come
off
victorious
only
take
care
to
perform
the
part
which
she
shall
bid
you
what
she
blames
do
you
blame
whatever
she
approves
do
you
approve
what
she
says
do
you
say
what
she
denies
do
you
deny
does
she
smile
do
you
smile
if
she
weeps
do
you
remember
to
weep
let
her
prescribe
the
law
for
the
regulation
of
your
features
if
she
plays
and
throws
the
ivory
cubes
with
her
hand
do
you
throw
unsuccessfully
do
you
make
bad
moves
to
the
throws
or
if
you
are
throwing
the
dice
let
not
the
penalty
attend
upon
her
losing
take
care
that
losing
throws
often
befall
yourself
if
your
piece
is
moving
at
the
game
that
imitates
the
tactics
of
war
take
care
that
your
man
falls
before
his
enemy
of
glass
do
you
yourself
hold
the
screen
stretched
out
by
its
ribs
do
you
make
room
in
the
crowd
the
way
that
she
is
going
and
do
not
delay
to
place
the
footstool
before
the
tasteful
couch
and
take
off
or
put
on
the
sandals
for
her
delicate
feet
often
too
must
the
hand
of
your
mistress
when
cold
be
made
warm
in
your
bosom
though
you
yourself
should
shiver
in
consequence
and
think
it
no
disgrace
although
it
should
be
a
disgrace
to
you
still
it
will
give
pleasure
to
hold
the
with
the
hand
of
a
man
he
who
by
killing
the
monsters
of
his
wearied
earned
those
heavens
which
before
he
had
supported
is
believed
amid
the
ionian
girls
to
have
held
the
and
to
have
wrought
the
rough
wool
the
tirynthian
hero
was
obedient
to
the
commands
of
his
mistress
go
then
and
hesitate
to
endure
what
he
submitted
to
when
bidden
to
come
to
the
forum
take
care
always
to
be
there
before
the
appointed
time
and
do
not
go
away
until
a
late
hour
does
she
appoint
to
meet
you
at
any
place
put
off
everything
else
run
quickly
and
let
not
the
crowd
stop
your
purposed
route
is
she
returning
home
at
night
after
having
been
at
a
feast
then
too
if
she
calls
come
to
her
as
though
a
servant
if
you
are
in
the
country
and
she
says
come
love
hates
the
tardy
if
a
vehicle
is
not
at
hand
go
your
journey
on
foot
let
neither
bad
weather
nor
the
parching
detain
you
nor
the
road
made
white
with
the
snow
that
lies
there
love
is
a
kind
of
warfare
cowards
avaunt
these
are
not
the
standards
to
be
defended
by
timid
men
in
this
tender
warfare
night
and
wintry
storms
and
long
journies
and
cruel
pain
and
every
kind
of
toil
have
their
part
many
a
time
will
you
have
to
endure
the
rain
pouring
from
the
clouds
of
heaven
cold
and
on
the
bare
ground
full
oft
will
you
lie
cynthius
said
to
have
fed
the
cows
of
admetus
of
pheræ
and
to
have
lived
in
an
humble
cottage
what
was
becoming
to
phoebus
to
whom
is
it
not
becoming
away
with
all
conceit
whoever
you
are
who
have
a
care
for
a
lasting
passion
if
access
is
denied
you
by
a
safe
and
smooth
path
and
if
her
door
shall
be
fastened
by
the
bar
put
up
then
do
you
slip
straight
down
through
the
open
roof
let
the
high
window
too
present
a
secret
passage
she
will
be
pleased
when
she
knows
that
she
has
proved
the
cause
of
risk
to
you
this
will
be
to
your
mistress
a
pledge
of
your
unvarying
love
full
oft
leander
couldst
thou
have
done
without
thy
mistress
that
she
might
know
thy
passion
thou
didst
swim
across
and
be
not
ashamed
to
make
her
handmaids
as
each
one
is
superior
in
rank
nor
yet
her
male
servants
entirely
your
own
salute
them
each
by
name
there
will
be
nothing
thrown
away
press
their
humble
hands
proud
lover
with
your
own
moreover
the
expense
is
but
trifling
give
to
the
servant
who
asks
some
little
present
from
your
means
make
a
present
too
to
the
handmaid
on
the
day
on
which
the
gallic
army
deceived
by
the
garments
of
the
matrons
received
retribution
follow
my
advice
and
make
the
lower
classes
your
own
in
that
number
let
there
always
be
the
porter
and
him
who
lies
before
the
door
of
her
chamber
and
i
do
not
bid
you
present
to
your
mistress
any
costly
gift
give
her
moderate
ones
but
in
your
discrimination
well
selected
from
those
that
are
moderate
while
the
country
is
abundantly
rich
in
produce
while
the
branches
are
bending
beneath
their
load
let
the
boy
bring
your
gifts
from
the
country
in
his
basket
you
may
say
that
they
have
been
sent
by
you
from
your
suburban
retreat
although
they
may
have
been
bought
even
in
the
sacred
street
let
him
carry
either
grapes
or
what
amaryllis
was
so
fond
of
but
at
the
present
day
she
is
fond
of
chesnuts
no
longer
and
besides
both
with
a
thrush
and
a
pigeon
sent
as
a
present
you
may
show
how
attentive
you
are
to
your
mistress
by
these
means
are
the
expectations
of
death
and
solitary
old
age
disgracefully
made
matter
of
purchase
oh
may
they
perish
through
whom
gifts
promote
criminal
objects
why
should
i
recommend
you
to
send
tender
lines
as
well
alas
poetry
does
not
gain
much
honour
verses
are
praised
but
is
costly
gifts
that
are
sought
if
he
is
only
rich
a
very
barbarian
is
pleasing
truly
is
this
the
golden
age
the
greatest
honours
accrue
through
gold
love
is
purchased
with
gold
though
thou
thyself
homer
shouldst
come
attended
by
the
muses
if
thou
shouldst
bring
nothing
with
thee
thou
wouldst
be
turned
out
of
doors
and
yet
there
are
the
learned
fair
a
very
limited
number
another
set
are
not
learned
but
they
wish
to
be
so
both
kinds
may
be
praised
in
verse
the
reader
may
set
off
the
lines
of
whatever
quality
by
a
melodious
voice
indeed
a
poem
carefully
composed
in
their
honour
will
be
to
these
or
to
those
as
good
perhaps
as
a
little
present
but
take
care
that
whatever
you
are
about
to
do
of
your
own
accord
and
consider
convenient
your
mistress
shall
always
first
ask
that
of
you
has
freedom
been
promised
to
any
one
of
your
slaves
still
cause
him
to
make
a
request
for
it
of
your
mistress
if
you
forgive
punishment
and
cruel
fetters
to
your
slave
let
her
be
indebted
to
you
for
what
you
were
about
to
do
let
the
advantage
be
your
own
let
the
credit
be
given
to
your
mistress
suffer
no
loss
yourself
and
let
her
act
the
part
of
the
person
in
power
but
whosoever
you
are
who
have
a
care
to
retain
the
fair
cause
her
to
believe
that
you
are
enchanted
with
her
beauty
if
she
is
in
tyrian
costume
praise
the
dress
of
tyrian
hue
if
she
is
in
that
of
cos
consider
the
coan
habit
as
becoming
is
she
arrayed
in
gold
let
her
be
more
precious
in
your
eyes
than
gold
itself
if
she
wears
a
dress
of
felt
praise
the
felt
dress
that
she
wears
does
she
stand
before
you
in
her
tunic
exclaim
you
are
setting
me
on
fire
but
entreat
her
with
a
voice
of
anxiety
to
beware
of
the
cold
is
the
parting
of
her
hair
nicely
arranged
praise
the
parting
of
it
has
she
curled
her
hair
by
aid
of
the
fire
curled
locks
do
you
prove
the
attraction
as
she
dances
admire
her
arms
her
voice
as
she
sings
and
use
the
words
of
one
complaining
because
she
has
left
off
her
very
embraces
you
may
commend
on
the
points
that
please
yourself
and
with
murmuring
accents
you
may
signify
your
delight
though
she
be
more
fierce
than
the
grim
medusa
to
her
lover
she
will
become
gentle
and
kind
only
take
you
care
that
you
be
not
discovered
to
be
a
deceiver
in
these
expressions
and
by
your
looks
do
not
contradict
your
words
if
devices
are
concealed
they
are
of
use
when
discovered
they
cause
shame
and
deservedly
remove
confidence
for
all
future
time
often
at
the
approach
of
autumn
when
the
year
is
most
beauteous
and
the
filled
grape
is
growing
red
with
its
purple
juice
at
the
time
when
at
one
moment
we
are
chilled
with
cold
at
another
we
are
melted
with
heat
through
the
varying
temperature
a
languor
takes
possession
of
the
body
she
indeed
may
be
in
good
health
but
if
through
illness
she
keeps
her
bed
and
ailing
feels
the
bad
effects
of
the
weather
then
let
your
love
and
affection
be
proved
to
the
fair
then
sow
that
hereafter
with
the
sickle
of
abundance
you
may
reap
let
no
disgust
at
her
malady
that
renders
her
so
cross
come
upon
you
by
your
hands
too
let
whatever
she
will
permit
be
done
and
let
her
see
you
as
you
weep
and
be
not
tired
of
giving
her
kisses
and
with
her
parched
lips
let
her
dry
up
your
tears
make
many
a
vow
for
her
cure
but
all
before
her
and
as
often
as
she
will
permit
be
seeing
pleasant
visions
to
tell
her
of
let
the
old
woman
come
too
to
purify
her
couch
and
chamber
and
in
her
palsied
hand
let
her
carry
before
her
the
sulphur
and
the
eggs
in
all
these
things
there
will
be
traces
of
a
pleasing
attention
for
many
a
one
has
this
road
proved
a
path
to
another
man
will
but
still
let
not
loathing
on
the
part
of
the
sick
fair
be
the
result
of
your
officiousness
let
there
be
certain
limits
shown
in
your
careful
attentiveness
do
not
you
forbid
her
food
nor
administer
the
cups
with
the
bitter
draught
let
your
rival
mingle
those
but
when
you
have
gained
the
open
sea
you
must
not
use
the
breeze
to
which
you
set
your
sails
from
off
the
shore
while
love
is
wandering
in
his
youth
let
him
gain
strength
by
habit
if
you
nurse
him
well
in
time
he
will
be
strong
him
that
you
fear
as
a
bull
as
a
calf
you
were
wont
to
pat
the
tree
under
which
you
are
now
reclining
was
once
a
twig
a
river
at
its
rise
is
small
but
it
acquires
strength
in
its
course
and
where
it
runs
it
now
receives
many
a
stream
make
her
become
used
to
you
there
is
nothing
more
powerful
than
habit
while
you
are
courting
her
avoid
no
amount
of
trouble
let
her
be
always
seeing
you
let
her
be
always
lending
ear
to
you
let
both
night
and
day
show
your
countenance
when
you
have
a
greater
confidence
that
you
may
be
missed
then
destined
to
be
her
care
when
absent
go
away
to
a
distance
give
yourself
some
repose
the
land
that
has
lain
fallow
gives
back
in
abundance
what
has
been
entrusted
to
it
and
the
dry
ground
sucks
up
the
water
of
the
heavens
demophoôn
when

inflamed
phyllis

a
less
degree
when

by
his

far
away
tearful
laodamia
was
thy
hero
of

but
a
short
respite
alone
is
safe
in

cares
become
modified
and
the
absent
love
decays
and
a
new
one
makes
its
entrance
while

was
absent
helen
that
she
might
not

alone
was
received
at
night
into
the
warm
bosom
of
his

what
meant

this
stupidity
of
thine
thou
didst
go
away
alone
under
the
same
roof
were
both
the
stranger
and
thy
wife
and
dost
thou

to

hawk
dost
thou

commits
no
sin
this
paramour
of
hers
does
no

does
what
thou
what
any
one
would
do
thou
dost
persuade
them
to
adultery
by
giving
both
time
and
opportunity
what
advice
but
thine
own
has
the
fair
made
use
of
what
is
she
to
do
her
husband
is
away
and
a
guest
no
repulsive
person
is
present
and
she
is
afraid
to
sleep
alone
in
an
empty
couch
let
the
son
of
atreus
think
better
of
it
i
acquit
helen
of
criminality
she
made
use
of
the
opportunity
given
by
an
easy
husband
but
neither
is
the
tawny
boar
so
fierce
in
the
midst
of
his
rage
when
he
hurls
the
furious
dogs
with
the
lightning
shock
of
his
tusks
nor
the
lioness
when
she
is
giving
the
breast
to
her
sucking
whelps
nor
the
little
viper
when
inhired
by
the
heedless
foot
as
the
woman
who
is
furious
on
detecting
the
rival
of
her
nuptial
couch
and
bears
on
her
features
the
proofs
of
her
feelings
to
the
sword
and
to
flames
does
she
resort
and
shame
laid
aside
onward
she
is
impelled
as
though
struck
by
the
horns
of
the
aonian
god
the
barbarian
fair
one
of
phasis
avenged
the
fault
of
her
husband
and
the
violated
rights
of
a
wife
by
the
death
of
her
sons
see
how
another
cruel
parent
is
the
swallow
that
you
behold
has
her
breast
stained
with
blood
is
this
breaks
those
attachments
that
are
firmly
united
this
those
of
long
duration
these
faults
must
then
be
guarded
against
by
cautious
men
but
still
my
judgment
does
not
condemn
you
to
one
fair
alone
the
gods
forbid
hardly
can
the
married
woman
adhere
to
this
disport
yourself
but
let
your
faultiness
be
concealed
by
a
decent
stealthiness
no
glory
must
be
sought
in
one
own
delinquency
and
do
you
give
no
present
of
which
the
other
may
know
nor
be
there
any
stated
times
for
your
intriguing
and
lest
the
fair
one
should
catch
you
in
the
retreat
so
well
known
to
her
all
must
not
be
met
in
the
same
place
of
rendezvous
and
as
often
as
you
shall
be
writing
do
you
first
examine
the
whole
of
the
tablet
many
a
woman
reads
more
than
what
has
been
sent
to
her
a
slighted
passion
brandishes
the
arms
of
retribution
and
hurls
back
the
weapon
and
causes
yourself
to
complain
of
that
of
which
it
complained
so
lately
so
long
as
the
son
of
atreus
was
content
with
one
woman
she
too
was
chaste
through
the
fault
of
her
husband
did
she
become
culpable
she
had
heard
how
that
chryses
bearing
in
his
hand
the
laurel
and
the
fillets
had
not
prevailed
in
behalf
of
his
daughter
she
had
heard
too
ravished
one
of
lyrnesus
of
thy
sorrows
and
how
the
warfare
had
been
protracted
through
disgraceful
delays
still
these
things
she
had
only
heard
of
the
daughter
of
priam
herself
she
had
seen
thou
the
conqueror
wast
the
disgraced
captive
of
thy
own
captive
then
did
she
receive
the
son
of
thyestes
both
into
her
chamber
and
her
affections
and
the
daughter
of
tyndarus
avenged
herself
on
a
husband
so
deeply
criminal
your
actions
which
you
have
studiously
concealed
if
perchance
any
of
them
are
discovered
although
they
should
be
notorious
still
do
you
always
deny
them
on
such
occasions
do
you
neither
be
subdued
nor
more
kind
than
usual
that
bears
the
marks
of
a
mind
that
has
too
deeply
offended
still
spare
not
any
endearments
on
your
side
peace
is
entirely
centred
in
caresses
alone
by
these
must
the
former
intrigue
be
disavowed
there
are
some
who
would
recommend
you
to
use
injurious
herbs
such
as
savory
in
my
opinion
they
are
so
many
poisons
or
else
they
mingle
pepper
with
the
seed
of
the
stinging
nettle
and
the
yellow
camomile
pounded
in
old
wine
but
the
goddess
whom
the
lofty
eryx
receives
beneath
his
shady
hill
does
not
allow
us
to
be
impelled
in
such
manner
to
her
delights
the
white
onion
which
is
sent
from
the
pelasgian
city
of
alcathoiis
and
the
salacious
herbs
which
come
out
of
the
gardens
and
eggs
may
be
eaten
the
honey
of
hymettus
may
be
eaten
and
the
nuts
which
the
with
its
sharp
leaves
produces
why
learned
erato
art
thou
thus
diverging
into
the
medical
art
the
inner
side
of
the
must
be
grazed
by
my
chariot
you
who
just
now
were
by
my
recommendation
to
conceal
your
delinquencies
change
your
course
and
by
my
advice
disclose
your
intrigues
nor
yet
is
any
inconsistency
of
mine
to
be
censured
the
curving
ship
does
not
always
carry
those
on
board
with
the
same
breezes
for
sometimes
we
run
with
the
thracian
boreas
sometimes
with
the
east
wind
full
aft
does
the
canvass
swell
with
the
zephyrs
with
the
south
wind
full
aft
see
how
in
the
chariot
the
driver
at
one
moment
gives
the
flowing
rein
at
another
skilfully
checks
the
horses
in
full
career
there
are
some
with
whom
an
anxious
obsequiousness
is
ruinous
and
if
there
is
no
rival
existing
then
their
passion
waxes
faint
the
feelings
often
run
riot
amid
prosperity
and
to
bear
good
fortune
with
equanimity
is
no
easy
task
as
the
declining
fire
its
strength
consuming
by
degrees
itself
lies
concealed
and
the
ashes
become
white
over
the
surface
of
the
fire
but
still
when
sulphur
is
applied
it
finds
the
flames
that
were
extinguished
and
the
light
returns
which
existed
before
so
when
the
feelings
sluggish
through
repose
and
free
from
care
become
torpid
by
sharp
stimulants
must
love
be
aroused
make
her
to
be
jealous
on
your
account
and
rekindle
her
deadened
feelings
let
her
turn
pale
at
the
proof
of
your
inconstancy
oh
four
times
blest
and
so
oft
that
it
is
not
possible
to
limit
it
to
numbers
is
that
man
on
whose
account
the
slighted
fair
is
in
grief
who
soon
as
the
charge
has
reached
her
unwilling
ears
faints
away
and
both
her
voice
and
colour
leave
the
sorrowing
fair
would
that
i
were
he
whose
locks
she
tears
in
her
fury
would
that
i
were
he
whose
tender
cheeks
she
tears
with
her
nails
whom
she
looks
upon
bursting
into
tears
whom
she
beholds
with
scowling
eyes
without
whom
she
can
not
exist
wishes
that
she
could
if
you
enquire
as
to
its
duration
let
the
time
be
short
for
her
to
complain
of
her
injuries
lest
her
anger
may
acquire
strength
in
the
slowly
passing
lapse
of
time
and
now
let
her
fair
neck
be
encircled
in
your
arms
and
as
she
weeps
she
must
be
received
in
your
bosom
give
her
kisses
as
she
weeps
bestow
her
caresses
as
she
weeps
peace
will
ensue
by
this
method
alone
is
anger
appeased
when
she
has
been
passionately
raving
when
she
shall
seem
to
be
an
assured
enemy
then
seek
your
treaty
of
peace
in
caresses
she
will
then
be
pacified
for
is
there
that
concord
dwells
all
arms
laid
aside
is
in
that
spot
believe
me
that
the
graces
were
born
the
doves
which
fought
the
moment
before
are
now
billing
their
cooing
has
the
meaning
of
caresses
and
of
words
at
first
there
was
a
confused
mass
of
things
without
arrangement
and
the
stars
the
earth
and
the
ocean
were
but
of
one
appearance
afterwards
the
heavens
were
placed
above
the
earth
the
land
was
surrounded
by
the
sea
and
the
confused
chaos
was
divided
into
its
elements
the
woods
received
the
beasts
the
air
the
birds
as
its
possession
in
the
flowing
waters
you
fishes
were
concealed
at
that
time
the
human
race
wandered
in
the
solitary
woods
and
it
consisted
of
nothing
but
brute
force
and
a
mind
quite
uninformed
the
woods
were
their
houses
grass
their
food
and
leaves
their
beds
and
for
a
long
time
the
one
was
unknown
to
the
other
voluptuous
pleasure
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
soften
their
rude
dispositions
afterwards
the
woman
and
the
man
settled
in
the
same
spot
what
should
they
do
they
had
been
instructed
by
no
preceptor
venus
completed
this
delightful
task
without
any
art
the
bird
has
an
object
to
love
the
female
fish
finds
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
an
object
with
which
to
share
her
joys
the
hind
follows
her
mate
the
serpent
couples
with
the
serpent
the
bitch
too
consorts
with
the
dog
the
delighted
sheep
unites
with
the
ram
the
heifer
also
is
pleased
with
the
bull
the
too
receives
her
unclean
mate
mares
are
driven
to
frenzy
and
follow
the
horses
separated
by
streams
over
places
far
distant
from
each
other
in
situation
come
then
and
give
an
efficacious
remedy
to
the
angered
fair
is
that
alone
that
puts
an
end
to
violent
grief
is
that
remedy
which
excels
the
potions
of
machaon
through
that
when
you
have
offended
you
will
have
to
be
reinstated
while
i
was
thus
singing
apollo
suddenly
appearing
touched
with
his
thumb
the
strings
of
his
lyre
inlaid
with
gold
in
his
hands
there
was
a
laurel
placed
on
his
holy
locks
there
was
a
laurel
visible
as
a
poet
he
came
thou
instructor
in
wanton
love
says
he
come
lead
thy
pupils
to
my
temples
there
is
there
a
sentence
celebrated
in
fame
over
the
universal
world
which
bids
each
one
to
know
himself
he
who
shall
be
known
to
himself
will
alone
love
with
prudence
and
will
proportion
every
task
to
his
strength
he
to
whom
nature
has
given
beauty
for
that
let
him
be
admired
he
who
has
a
fair
complexion
let
him
often
lie
down
with
a
shoulder
exposed
he
who
charms
with
his
discourse
let
him
break
the
quietude
of
silence
he
who
sings
with
skill
let
him
sing
he
who
drinks
with
elegance
let
him
drink
but
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
neither
let
those
who
are
eloquent
declaim
and
let
not
the
insane
poet
be
reciting
his
own
compositions
thus
phoebus
recommended
observe
this
recommendation
of
phoebus
there
is
full
confidence
in
the
hallowed
lips
of
this
divinity
i
am
now
called
to
my
more
immediate
subject
whoever
shall
love
with
prudence
he
will
prove
successful
and
will
obtain
from
my
skill
what
he
shall
require
the
furrows
do
not
always
return
with
interest
that
which
has
been
entrusted
to
them
nor
does
the
breeze
always
aid
the
veering
barks
what
pleases
lovers
is
but
a
little
is
much
more
that
crosses
them
let
them
resolve
to
endure
many
things
with
their
feelings
as
many
as
are
the
hares
on
athos
as
the
bees
that
feed
on
hybla
as
the
berries
which
the
tree
of
pallas
bears
as
the
shells
on
the
so
many
are
the
pangs
of
love
the
shafts
which
we
endure
are
reeking
with
plenteous
gall
she
whom
perchance
you
shall
see
will
be
said
to
have
gone
out
of
doors
believe
that
she
is
gone
out
of
doors
and
that
you
make
a
mistake
in
your
seeing
is
the
door
shut
against
you
on
the
appointed
night
endure
even
to
lay
your
body
on
the
dirty
ground
perhaps
too
the
lying
maid
will
say
with
a
haughty
air
why
is
that
fellow
blocking
up
our
door
suppliantly
entreat
even
the
of
the
obdurate
fair
and
place
at
the
door
the
roses
that
have
been
taken
from
off
your
head
come
when
she
desires
it
when
she
shall
shun
you
you
go
away
it
is
not
becoming
for
men
of
good
breeding
to
cause
weariness
of
their
company
why
should
your
mistress
be
able
to
say
of
you
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
this
man
the
senses
are
not
on
the
alert
at
all
hours
and
deem
it
no
disgrace
to
put
up
with
the
curses
of
the
fair
one
or
her
blows
nor
yet
to
give
kisses
to
her
delicate
feet
but
why
dwell
upon
trifles
let
my
mind
be
occupied
with
greater
subjects
of
great
matters
will
i
sing
people
give
all
attention
i
attempt
an
arduous
task
but
merit
there
is
none
but
what
is
secured
by
arduous
means
by
my
undertaking
are
laborious
attempts
required
endure
a
rival
with
patience
the
victory
will
rest
with
yourself
you
will
be
the
conqueror
on
the
heights
of
mighty
jove
believe
that
not
a
mortal
tells
you
this
but
the
pelasgian
oaks
of
dodona
my
skill
has
nothing
superior
to
this
to
teach
you
does
she
make
a
sign
to
him
do
you
put
up
with
it
does
she
write
do
you
touch
the
tablets
let
her
come
from
whatever
place
she
likes
and
wherever
she
chooses
let
her
go
this
do
husbands
allow
to
their
lawful
wives
even
too
when
thou
gentle
sleep
dost
come
to
thy
duty
i
confess
that
in
this
art
i
myself
am
not
yet
perfect
what
must
i
do
i
am
myself
unequal
to
my
own
precepts
and
is
any
one
in
my
presence
to
be
making
signs
to
my
mistress
and
am
i
to
endure
it
and
is
not
my
anger
to
hurry
me
away
to
any
extreme
her
own
husband
i
remember
it
well
gave
her
a
kiss
i
complained
of
kisses
being
given
my
love
is
brimful
of
fierceness
not
once
alone
has
this
failing
proved
an
injury
to
me
he
is
more
skilful
by
whose
encouragement
other
men
visit
his
mistress
but
still
better
to
know
nothing
of
it
allow
stealthy
intrigues
to
lie
concealed
lest
the
blush
of
confession
should
fly
in
future
from
her
countenance
when
detected
with
greater
reason
then
ye
youths
forbear
to
detect
your
mistresses
let
them
be
guilty
and
guilty
let
them
suppose
that
they
have
deceived
you
when
detected
the
passion
increases
when
the
fortune
of
the
two
is
the
same
each
persists
in
the
cause
of
the
disgrace
there
is
a
story
told
very
well
known
in
all
the
heavens
how
mars
and
venus
were
caught
by
the
contrivance
of
mulciber
father
mars
distracted
by
a
frantic
passion
for
venus
from
a
terrible
warrior
became
a
lover
neither
did
venus
for
indeed
no
goddess
is
there
more
kind
proved
coy
or
stubborn
to
gradivus
o
how
many
a
time
is
she
said
in
her
wantonness
to
have
laughed
at
the
feet
of
her
husband
and
at
his
hands
hardened
with
the
fire
or
his
handicraft
in
the
presence
of
mars
mocking
him
she
imitated
her
husband
and
she
was
beauteous
while
so
and
many
a
grace
was
there
combined
with
her
charms
but
they
were
in
the
habit
of
skilfully
concealing
their
early
intercourse
and
their
frailty
was
replete
with
modest
propriety
through
the
information
of
the
sun
who
is
there
that
can
deceive
the
sun
the
actions
of
his
wife
became
known
to
vulcan
thou
sun
what
a
bad
example
thou
art
setting
ask
a
bribe
of
her
and
shouldst
thou
hold
thy
tongue
she
has
a
favour
which
she
may
grant
to
thee

above
the
bed
muleiber

the
hidden

its
fineness

their
eyes
he
pretends
a
journey
to

the
lovers

according
to
the
appointment
entangled
in
the
toils
they
both
lie
naked
he

gods
together
the
captives

a
spectacle
people
believe
that
venus
could
hardly
restrain
her
tears
they
can
not
conceal
their
faces
they
can
not
in
fact
veil
their
modesty
with
their
hands
upon
this

transfer
to
me
thy
chains
most
valiant
mavors
if
they
are
a

thee
with

neptune
at

their

she
for

this
vulcan
was
done
by
thee
what
before
they
used
to
conceal
they
now
do
more
openly
since
all
modesty
is
gone
yet
often
foolish
one
dost
thou
confess
that
thou
didst
act
unwisely
and
they
say
that
thou
hast
repented
of
thy
wrath
this
i
have
already
forbidden
lo
dione
forbids
you
to
suffer
that
detection
which
she
herself
endured
and
do
you
arrange
no
toils
for
your
rival
and
intercept
no
words
written
by
the
hand
in
secret
let
the
men
seek
for
those
if
indeed
they
think
they
ought
to
be
sought
for
whom
the
fire
and
water
render
lawful
husbands
behold
again
do
i
protest
no
sportive
subject
is
here
treated
of
but
what
is
permitted
by
the
laws
there
is
no
matron
concerned
with
my
sallies
who
would
dare
to
publish
to
the
profane
the
rites
of
ceres
and
the
great
mysteries
that
were
established
in
the
thracian
samos
is
a
small
merit
to
hold
one
silence
upon
matters
but
on
the
other
hand
is
a
grievous
fault
to
speak
of
things
on
which
we
should
be
silent
o
justly
does
it
happen
that
the
blabbing
tantalus
is
thirsting
in
the
midst
of
the
water
the
apples
on
the
tree
being
caught
at
by
him
in
vain
cytherea
especially
bids
her
rites
to
be
concealed
i
recommend
no
talkative
person
to
approach
them
if
the
mysteries
of
venus
are
not
enclosed
in
chests
and
the
hollow
cymbals
do
not
resound
with
frantic
blows
although
among
ourselves
they
are
celebrated
by
universal
custom
yet
it
is
in
such
a
manner
that
among
us
they
demand
concealment
venus
herself
as
oft
as
she
lays
her
garments
aside
conceals
her
groin
with
the
left
hand
a
little
bent
back
the
cattle
couple
in
public
and
promiscuously
even
when
this
is
seen
full
oft
the
fair
one
turns
away
her
face
chambers
and
doors
are
provided
for
our
stealthy
dalliance
and
our
nakedness
lies
concealed
by
garments
placed
over
it
and
if
we
do
not
require
darkness
still
we
do
something
of
a
retired
shade
and
something
less
exposed
than
open
day
in
those
times
even
when
tiles
did
not
as
yet
keep
out
the
sun
and
the
shower
but
the
oak
was
affording
both
shelter
and
food
in
the
groves
and
caves
and
not
in
the
open
air
were
shared
the
delights
of
love
so
great
was
the
regard
for
modesty
even
in
a
savage
race
but
we
give
praises
to
the
exploits
of
the
night
and
nothing
beyond
the
power
of
talking
of
it
is
purchased
at
a
heavy
price
you
will
for
sooth
be
discussing
all
the
damsels
in
every
quarter
that
you
may
say
to
every
person
she
too
has
been
mine
that
none
may
be
wanting
for
you
to
point
at
with
your
fingers
and
as
you
touch
upon
each
there
will
be
a
scandalous
tale
but
i
am
complaining
of
trifles
some
pretend
things
which
if
true
they
would
deny
and
not
declare
that
there
is
not
a
woman
from
whom
they
have
not
received
the
last
favour
if
they
can
not
meddle
with
their
persons
so
far
as
they
can
they
meddle
with
their
names
and
their
persons
untouched
their
reputation
bears
the
blame
go
now
odious
keeper
and
shut
the
doors
of
the
fair
and
add
to
the
solid
a
hundred
bars
what
safety
is
there
while
the
defiler
of
character
exists
and
desires
to
be
thought
that
he
is
that
which
it
has
not
proved
his
lot
to
be
even
my
real
amours
i
confess
but
with
reserve
and
my
secret
intrigues
are
concealed
with
sure
fidelity
especially
forbear
to
censure
the
blemishes
of
the
fair
to
many
it
has
proved
of
advantage
to
conceal
them
her
complexion
was
not
made
an
objection
against
andromeda
by
him
on
whose
two
feet
were
the
waving
wings
to
all
others
andromache
seemed
of
larger
stature
than
was
becoming
hector
was
the
only
one
who
called
her
of
moderate
size
what
you
endure
with
impatience
accustom
yourself
to
and
you
will
endure
it
with
patience
length
of
time
makes
many
things
endurable
but
a
rising
passion
catches
sight
of
everything
while
the
young
branch
is
uniting
within
the
green
bark
whatever
breeze
shakes
it
while
now
tender
it
falls
soon
hardened
in
time
the
same
tree
will
stoutly
resist
the
winds
and
bear
the
adopted
fruit
time
itself
removes
all
blemishes
from
the
person
and
what
was
a
fault
in
lapse
of
time
ceases
so
to
be
the
nostrils
that
are
unaccustomed
to
it
are
not
able
to
endure
the
hides
of
bulls
the
odour
is
not
perceived
by
those
that
have
been
rendered
used
to
it
in
length
of
time
we
may
palliate
faults
by
names
let
her
be
called
swarthy
whose
blood
is
blacker
than
the
pitch
of
illyria
if
she
has
a
cast
in
the
eyes
she
is
like
venus
if
yellow
haired
like
minerva
she
that
is
only
half
alive
through
her
leanness
let
her
be
grace
ful
whatever
woman
is
small
say
that
she
is
active
her
that
is
gross
call
plump
and
let
each
fault
lie
concealed
in
its
proximity
to
some
good
quality
and
do
you
enquire
what
year
she
is
now
passing
nor
under
what
consulship
she
was
born
a
privilege
which
the
rigid
censor
possesses
and
this
especially
if
she
has
passed
the
bloom
of
youth
and
her
best
years
are
fled
and
she
now
pulls
out
the
whitening
hairs
this
age
o
youths
or
even
one
more
advanced
has
its
advantages
this
soil
will
produce
its
crops
this
is
worth
the
sowing
while
strength
and
years
permit
endure
labour
soon
will
bending
old
age
come
with
silent
foot
either
cleave
the
ocean
with
the
oars
or
the
earth
with
the
plough
or
turn
your
warlike
hands
to
cruel
arms
or
devote
your
strength
and
your
attention
to
the
fair
this
too
is
a
kind
of
warfare
this
too
seeks
its
advantages
besides
in
these
there
is
a
greater
acquaintance
with
their
subject
and
there
is
long
practice
which
alone
renders
skilful
by
attention
to
dress
they
repair
the
ravages
of
years
and
by
carefulness
they
cause
themselves
not

both
in

still

jason
the
deceiver
repudiated
the
phasian
when
now
a
mother
and
into
the
bosom
of
the
son
of
æson
there
came
another
bride
ariadne
left
alone
in
an
unknown
spot
had
fed
the
so
far
theseus
as
thou
wast
concerned
enquire
why
she
is
said
to
have
gone
on
her
nine
journies
and
hear
how
the
woods
lamented
phyllis
their
foliage
laid
aside
and
elissa
she
has
the
credit
of
affection
and
still
that
guest
of
thine
elissa
afforded
both
the
sword
and
the
cause
for
thy
destruction
shall
i
tell
what
it
was
that
ruined
thee
thou
didst
not
know
how
to
love
thou
wast
wanting
in
skill
through
skill
love
flourishes
for
ever
even
still
would
they
have
been
ignorant
but
cytherea
commanded
me
to
instruct
them
and
stood
herself
before
my
eyes
then
to
me
she
said
why
have
the
unfortunate
fair
deserved
this
an
unarmed
multitude
is
handed
over
to
the
men
in
arms
two
treatises
have
rendered
them
skilful
this
side
as
well
must
be
instructed
by
thy
advice
he
who
before
had
uttered
reproaches
against
the
wife
from
therapnæ
soon
sang
her
praises
to
a
more
fortunate
lyre
if
well
i
know
thee
injure
not
the
fair
whom
thou
dost
adore
their
favour
must
be
sought
by
thee
so
long
as
thou
shalt
live
thus
she
said
and
from
the
myrtle
for
she
was
standing
with
her
locks
wreathed
with
myrtle
she
gave
me
a
leaf
and
a
few
berries
receiving
them
i
was
sensible
of
the
divine
influence
as
well
the
sky
shone
with
greater
brightness
and
all
care
departed
from
my
breast
while
she
inspires
my
genius
hence
receive
the
precepts
ye
fair
which
propriety
and
the
laws
and
your
own
privileges
allow
you
even
now
be
mindful
of
old
age
that
one
day
will
come
then
will
no
time
be
passed
by
you
in
idleness
disport
yourselves
while
yet
you
may
and
while
even
now
you
confess
to
your
true
years
after
the
manner
of
the
flowing
stream
do
the
years
pass
by
neither
shall
the
water
which
has
past
by
be
ever
recalled
nor
can
the
hour
which
has
past
ever
return
you
must
employ
your
youthful
age
with
swift
step
age
is
gliding
on
and
that
which
follows
is
not
so
pleasing
as
that
which
having
passed
was
charming
those
brakes
which
are
withering
i
have
beheld
as
beds
of
violets
from
amid
those
brambles
has
a
beauteous
chaplet
been
gathered
for
myself
the
time
will
be
when
you
who
are
now
shutting
out
a
lover
will
be
lying
an
old
woman
chilled
in
the
lonely
night
no
door
of
yours
will
be
broken
open
in
the
broils
of
the
night
nor
will
you
find
in
the
morning
your
threshold
bestrewed
with
roses
how
soon
ah
me
are
our
bodies
pursed
with
wrinkles
and
that
colour
which
existed
in
the
beauteous
face
fades
away
the
grey
hairs
too
which
you
might
have
sworn
that
you
had
had
from
childhood
will
suddenly
be
sprinkled
over
all
your
head
old
age
is
thrown
off
by
serpents
together
with
the
light
slough
and
the
shedding
of
their
horns
makes
the
stags
not
to
be
old
our
advantages
fly
irretrievably
pluck
the
flowers
then
if
they
be
not
plucked
they
will
lamentably
fade
themselves
to
your
sorrow
besides
makes
the
hours
of
youth
more
with
continual
crops
the
soil
waxes
old
endymion
of
latmus
o
moon
causes
not
thee
to
blush
nor
was
cephalus
a
prey
for
the
rosy
goddess
to
be
ashamed
of
though
adonis
be
allowed
to
venus
whom
she
yet
laments
whence
had
she
æneas

hermione
for
her
children
follow
o
race
of
mortals
the
example
of
the
goddesses
and
refuse
not
your
endearments
to
the
eager
men
even
should
they
deceive
you
what
do
you
lose
all
remains
the
same
were
a
thousand
to
partake
thereof
nothing
is
wasted
thereby
iron
is
worn
away
stones

your
persons
are
proof
against
all
apprehension
of

who
would
forbid
light
to
be
taken
from
another
light
presented
or
who
on
the
deep
sea
would
hoard
up
the
expanse
of
waters
but
is
not
right
you
say
for
any
woman
to
grant
favours
to
a
man
tell
me
what
are
you
losing
but
the
water
which
you
may
take
up
again
nor
are
my
words
urging
you
to
prostitution
but
they
are
forbidding
you
to
fear
evils
that
do
not
exist
your
favours
are
exempt
from
loss
to
yourselves
but
while
i
am
in

let
a
gentle
breeze
impel
me
destined

of

beauty
is
the
gift
of
the
divinity
how
many
a
one
prides
herself
on
her
beauty
still
a
great
part
of
you
is
wanting
in
such
endowments
care
will
confer
charms
charms
neglected
will
perish
even
though
she
be
like
the
idalian
goddess
if
the
fair
of
olden
times
did
not
pay
such
attention
to
their
persons
neither
had
the
ancients
men
so
if
andromache
was
clad
in
a
coarse
tunic
what
wonder
is
it
she
was
the
wife
of
a
hardy
soldier
and
would
his
companion
forsooth
come
bedecked
to
ajax
him
whose
covering
was
seven
hides
of
oxen
formerly
a
rustic
simplicity
existed
now
gorgeous
rome
possesses
the
wealth
of
the
subdued
earth
see
the
capitol
what
it
now
is
and
what
it
was
you
would
declare
that
they
belonged
to
different
jupiters
the
which
is
now
right
worthy
of
an
assemblage
so
august
when
tatius
held
the
sway
was
made
of
straw
the
fields
of
the
palatine
hill
which
are
now
resplendent
in
honour
of
phoebus
and
our
rulers
what
were
they
but
pastures
for
the
oxen
that
ploughed
let
old
times
delight
others
i
congratulate
myself
that
i
am
born
thus
late
this
is
the
age
that
is
suited
to
my
tastes
not
because
the
pliable
gold
is
now
dug
out
of
the
earth
and
choice
shells
come
here
from
foreign
shores
nor
yet
because
the
marble
cut
out
mountains
diminish
nor
yet
because
the
azure
waves
are
kept
out
by
the
moles
but
because
civilization
prevails
and
because
the
rude
manners
that
flourished
with
our
ancient
forefathers
have
not
come
down
to
our
days
but
do
not
you
as
well
load
your
ears
with
precious
stones
which
the
tawny
indian
seeks
in
the
green
waves
and
do
not
go
forth
heavily
loaded
with
clothes
embroidered
with
gold
by
the
wealth
through
which
you

us
away
by

we
are

let
not
your
hair
be
without
arrangement
the
hands
applied
to
it
both
give
beauty
and
deny
it
the
method
too
of
adorning
is
not
a
single
one
let
each
choose
the
one
that
is
becoming
it
to
her
and
let
her
first
consult
her
mirror
an
oval
face
becomes
a
parting
upon
the
unadorned
head
laodamia
had
her
hair
thus
arranged
round
features
require
a
little
knot
to
be
left
for
them
on
the
top
of
the
head
so
that
the
ears
may
be
exposed
let
the
hair
of
another
he
thrown
over
either
shoulder
in
such
guise
art
thou
tuneful
phoebus
thy
lyre
being
assumed
let
another
lave
her
hair
tied
behind
after
the
manner
of
diana
as
she
is
wont
when
she
hunts
the
scared
wild
beasts
it
becomes
another
to
have
her
floating
locks
to
flow
loosely
another
must
be
bound
by
fillets
over
her
fastened
tresses
another
it
delights
to
be
adorned
with
the
figure
of
the
tortoise
of
the
cyllenian
god
let
another
keep
up
her
curls
that
resemble
the
waves
but
neither
will
you
count
the
acorns
on
the
branching
native
oak
nor
how
many
bees
there
are
in
hybla
nor
how
many
wild
beasts
on
the
alps
nor
am
i
able
to
comprehend
in
numbers
so
many
modes
successive
day
brings
a
new
even
neglected
locks
are
becoming
to
many
often
would
you
suppose
that
they
are
lying
neglected
since
yesterday
the
very
moment
before
they
have
been
combed
afresh
let
art
imitate
chance
was
thus
that
in
the
captured
city
when
hercules
beheld
iole
her
said
he
do
i
love
in
such
guise
deserted
fair
one
of
gnossus
did
bacchus
bear
thee
away
in
his
chariot
while
the
satyrs
shouted
evôe
o
how
indulgent
is
nature
to
your
beauty
whose
blemishes
can
be
atoned
for
in
fashions
so
numerous
we
men
to
our
misfortune
become
bald
and
our
hair
carried
away
by
time
falls
off
like
boreas
shaking
down
the
leaves
the
female
stains
her
grey
hair
with
the
herbs
from
germany
and
by
art
a
colour
is
sought
superior
to
the
genuine
one
the
female
walks
along
thickly
covered
with
purchased
hair
and
for
money
she
makes
that
of
others
here
comes
those
of
fair
complexion
black
became
the
laughter
of
brises
nor
is
she
ashamed
to
buy
it
openly
we
see
it
being
sold
before
the
eyes
of
hercules
and
the
virgin
throng
what
am
i
to
say
on
clothing
gold
flounces
i
have
no
need
of
you
nor
you
the
wool
which
dost
blush
twice
dipt
in
tyrian
purple
since
so
many
colours
can
be
procured
at
a
lower
price
what
folly
it
is
to
be
carrying
a
fortune
on
one
person
lo
there
is
the
colour
of
the
sky
at
the
time
when
the
sky
is
without
clouds
and
the
warm
south
wind
is
not
summoning
the
showers
of
rain
lo
there
is
the
colour
like
to
thee
that
art
said
once
to
have
borne
away
phryxus
and
helle
from
the
treachery
of
ino
that
which
resembles
the
waves
has
its
name
too
from
the
waves
i
could
imagine
that
the
nymphs
are
clad
in
vestments
of
this
colour
another
resembles
saffron
in
garments
is
the
dewy
goddess
dressed
when
she
yokes
her
steeds
that
bear
the
light
of
day
another
resembles
the
paphian
myrtles
another
the
purple
amethysts
or
the
white
roses
or
the
thracian
crane
neither
are
there
wanting
amaryllis
thy
chesnuts
nor
yet
almonds
and
wax
has
given
its
own

to
woollen
textures
as
many
as
the
flowers
which
the
renewed
earth
produces
when
in
warm
spring
the
vine
puts
forth
its
buds
and
sluggish
winter
retreats
so
many
or
still
more
shades
of

them
by
rule
for

colour

not
be
suitable
to
every
complexion
when
she
was
carried
off
then
too
was
she
clothed
in
a
dark
garment
white
befits
the
swarthy
in
white
daughter
of
cepheus
thou
wast
charming
by
thee
thus
clothed
was

nearly

i
recommending
you
that
there
should
be
no
shocking
goat
in
the
armpits
and
that
your
legs
should
not
be
rough
with
harsh
hair
but
i
am
not
instructing
fair
ones
from
the
crags
of
caucasus
and
who
are
drinking
mysian
caïcus
of
thy
waves
besides
need
i
to
recommend
that
idleness
should
not
blacken
your
teeth
and
that
your
mouth
ought
to
be
washed
each
morning
with
water
used
for
the
purpose
you
know
too
how
to
find
whiteness
in
an
application
of
wax
she
who
is
blushing
with
no
real
blood
is
blushing
by
the
aid
of
art
with
skill
do
you
fill
up
the
bared
edges
of
the
and
the
little
patch
covers
your
cheeks
in
all
their
genuineness
is
no
harm
too
to
mark
the
eyes
slightly
with
ashes
or
with
saffron
produced
beauteous
cydnus
near
to
thee
i
have
a
little
treatise
but
through
the
care
bestowed
a
great
work
in
which
i
have
mentioned
the
various
recipes
for
your
beauty
from
that
as
well
do
you
seek
aid
for
your
diminished
charms
my
skill
is
not
idle
in
behalf
of
your
interests
but
let
not
your
lover
discover
the
boxes
exposed
upon
the
table
art
by
its
concealment
only
gives
aid
to
beauty
whom
would
not
the
paint
disgust
besmeared
all
over
your
face
when
through
its
own
weight
it
flows
and
falls
upon
your
heated
bosom
why
is
the
smell
of
the
oesypum
so
powerful
sent
from
athens
though
it
be
an
extract
drawn
from
the
filthy
fleece
of
the
sheep
nor
would
i
recommend
you
in
his
presence
to
apply
the
mixture
of
the
marrow
of
the
deer
nor
before
him
to
clean
your
teeth
these
things
will
give
you
good
looks
but
they
will
be
unbecoming
to
be
seen
there
are
many
things
too
which
disgusting
while
being
done
add
charms
when
done
the
statues
which
now
bear
the
name
of
the
laborious
myron
were
once
a
sluggish
weight
and
a
solid
mass
that
the
ring
may
be
made
the
gold
is
first
beaten
the
clothes
that
you
are
wearing
were
once
dirty
wool
while
it
was
being
wrought
it
was
hard
stone
now
as
a
beautiful
statue
naked
venus
is
wringing
the
moisture
from
her
dripping
locks
you
too
while
you
are
dressing
let
us
suppose
to
be
asleep
after
the
finishing
hand
you
will
be
seen
much
more
àpropos
why
is
the
cause
of
the
fairness
of
your
complexion
known
to
me
shut
the
door
of
your
chamber
why
expose
the
work
half
done
it
is
proper
for
the
men
to
be
in
ignorance
of
many
a
thing
the
greatest
part
of
things
would
cause
disgust
if
you
were
not
to
conceal
what
is
within
examine
the
gilded
statues
which
hang
in
the
decorated
theatre
how
thin
the
tinsel
that
covers
the
wood
but
it
is
not
permitted
the
public
to
approach
them
unless
completed
neither
ought
your
charms
to
be
heightened
unless
the
men
are
at
a
distance
but
i
would
not
forbid
you
to
allow
your
hair
to
be
combed
in
their
presence
so
that
it
may
be
flowing
along
your
back
only
take
care
especially
on
such
occasions
not
to
be
cross
and
do
not
many
times
undo
your
hair
pulled
down
when
fastened
up
let
your
coiffeuse
be
with
a
whole
skin
i
detest
her
who
tears
the
face
of
her
attendant
with
her
nails
and
who
seizing
the
pierces
her
arms
as
she
touches
the
head
of
her
mistress
she
curses
it
and
at
the
same
time
streaming
with
blood
she
is
crying
over
the
odious
locks
the
fair
one
that
has
but
little
hair
let
her
set
a
watch
on
her
threshold
or
let
her
always
make
her
toilet
in
the
temple
of
the
good
goddess
i
was
unexpectedly
announced
as
having
paid
a
visit
to
a
certain
lady
in
her
confusion
she
put
on
her
locks
the
wrong
side
before
may
a
cause
of
shame
so
disgraceful
fall
to
the
lot
of
my
foes
and
may
that
dishonour
happen
to
the
parthian
dames
a
mutilated
animal
is
repulsive
the
fields
without
grass
are
repulsive
and
so
is
a
shrub
without
foliage
and
a
head
without
hair
you
have
not
come
to
be
instructed
by
me
semele
or
leda
thou
too
sidonian
fair
who
wast
borne
across
the
sea
upon
the
fictitious
bull
or
helen
whom
menelaus
not
without
reason
thou
didst
demand
to
be
restored
to
thee
and
whom
not
without
reason
thou
trojan
ravisher
didst
retain
a
multitude
comes
to
be
instructed
both
pretty
and
ugly
damsels
and
the
unsightly
are
ever
more
in
number
than
the
the
beauteous
care
less
for
the
resources
and
the
precepts
of
art
they
have
their
own
endowments
charms
that
are
powerful
without
art
when
the
sea
is
calm
the
sailor
rests
free
from
care
when
it
becomes
boisterous
he
appeals
to
his
own
resources
few
however
are
the
forms
free
from
defect
conceal
your
blemishes
and
so
far
as
you
can
hide
the
imperfections
of
your
person
if
you
are
short
sit
down
that
while
standing
you
may
not
appear
to
be
sitting
and
if
of
a
diminutive
size
throw
yourself
upon
your
couch
here
too
that
your
measure
may
not
be
able
to
be
taken
as
you
lie
take
care
that
your
feet
are
concealed
with
the
clothes
thrown
over
them
she
who
is
too
thin
let
her
wear
clothes
of
thick
texture
and
let
her
vestments
hang
loosely
from
her
shoulders
let
her
who
is
pale
tint
her
complexion
with
purple
stripes
do
you
that
are
more
swarthy
have
recourse
to
the
aid
of
the
pharian
fish
let
an
foot
be
always
concealed
in
a
boot
of
leather
steeped
in
alum
and
do
not
unloose
their
laced
sandals
from
the
spindly
legs
for
high
shoulders
small
pads
are
suitable
and
let
the
girth
encircle
the
bosom
that
is
too
prominent
she
whose
fingers
are
dumpy
and
whose
nails
are
rough
should
mark
with
but
little
gesture
whatever
is
said
she
whose
breath
is
strong
smelling
should
never
talk
with
an
empty
stomach
and
she
should
always
stand
at
a
distance
from
her
lover
face
if
your
teeth
are
black
or
large
or
not
growing
straight
you
will
suffer
very
great
inconvenience
from
laughing
who
could
have
supposed
it
the
fair
take
lessons
even
in
laughing
and
even
in
that
respect
is
gracefulness
studied
by
them
let
your
mouth
be
but
moderately
open
let
the
dimples
on
either
side
he
but
small
and
let
the
extremity
of
the
lips
cover
the
upper
part
of
the
teeth
and
do
not
let
your
sides
be
shaking
with
prolonged
laughter
but
let
them
utter
sounds
gentle
and
feminine
to
i
know
not
what
degree
some
there
are
who
distort
their
face
with
an
unsightly
grin
another
when
she
is
joyous
in
her
laughter
you
would
take
to
be
crying
another
makes
a
harsh
noise
and
screams
in
a
disagreeable
manner
just
as
the
unsightly
brays
by
the
rough
to
what
point
does
not
art
proceed
some
study
how
to
weep
with
grace
and
cry
at
what
time
and
in
what
manner
they
please
nay
further
when
the
letters
are
deprived
of
their
full
sound
and
the
lisping
tongue
becomes
contracted
with
an
affected
pronunciation
then
is
grace
sought
in
an
imperfection
to
pronounce
certain
words
badly
they
learn
to
be
less
able
to
speak
than
they
really
are
to
all
these
points
since
they
are
of
consequence
give
attention
learn
how
to
walk
with
steps
suited
to
a
female
even
in
the
gait
there
are
certain
points
of
gracefulness
not
to
be
disregarded
this
both
attracts
and
repels
men
who
are
strange
to
you
this
fair
one
moves
her
sides
with
skill
and
with
her
flowing
tunics
catches
the
breeze
and
haughtily
moves
her
extended
feet
another
walks
just
like
the
redfaced
spouse
of
some
umbrian
husband
and
straddling
takes
huge
strides
but
as
in
many
other
things
let
there
be
a
medium
here
as
well
one
movement
is
clownish
another
movement
will
be
too
mincing
in
its
gait
but
let
the
lower
part
of
your
shoulders
and
the
upper
part
of
your
arm
be
bare
to
be
beheld
from
your
left
hand
upwards
this
is
especially
becoming
to
you
ye
of
fair
complexion
when
i
see
this
i
have
always
a
longing
to
give
a
kiss
to
the
shoulder
where
it
is
exposed
the
sirens
were
monsters
of
the
deep
which
with
their
tuneful
voices
detained
the
ships
even
though
in
full
career
on
hearing
them
the
son
of
sisyphus
almost
released
his
body
from
the
mast
for
the
wax
was
melted
in
the
ears
of
his
companions
the
voice
is
an
insinuating
quality
let
the
fair
learn
how
to
sing
in
place
of
beauty
her
voice
has
proved
the
recommendation
of
many
a
woman
and
sometimes
let
them
repeat
what
they
have
heard
in
the
marble
theatres
and
sometimes
the
songs
attuned
to
the
measures
of
the
nile
neither
in
my
way
of
thinking
ought
a
clever
woman
to
be
ignorant
how
to
hold
the
plectrum
in
her
right
hand
the
lyre
in
her
left
orpheus
of
rhodope
with
his
lyre
moved
rocks
and
wild
beasts
and
the
lakes
of
tartarus
and
cerberus
the
triple
dog
at
thy
singing
most
righteous
avenger
of
thy
mother
the
attentive
stones
built
up
the
walls
the
fish
the
story
of
the
lyre
of
arion
although
he
was
dumb
is
supposed
to
have
been
moved
by
his
voice
learn
too
to
sweep
the
chords
of
the
festive
psaltery
with
your
two
hands
an
instrument
suited
to
amorous
lays
let
the
songs
of
callimachus
be
known
to
you
let
those
of
the
poet
of
cos
let
the
teian
muse
too
of
the
drunken
old
bard
let
sappho
too
be
well
known
for
what
is
there
more
exciting
than
she
or
than
him
through
whom
the
father
is
deceived
by
the
tricks
of
the
crafty
geta
you
may
too
have
read
the
poems
of
the
tender
propertius
or
something
of
gallus
or
thy
works
tibullus
the
fleece
too
so
bewailed
o
phryxus
of
thy
sister
shining
with
its
yellow
hair
celebrated
by
varro
the
exiled
æneas
as
well
the
first
origin
of
lofty
rome
than
which
no
work
exists
in
latium
of
greater
fame
perhaps
too
my
name
will
be
mingled
among
these
and
my
writings
will
not
be
consigned
to
the
waters
of
lethe
and
people
will
one
day
say
read
the
elegant
lines
of
our
master
in
which
he
instructs
the
two
sides
or
of
his
three
books
which
the
title
designates
as
amours
choose
a
portion
to
read
with
skilful
lips
in
a
languishing
way
or
let
his
epistles
be
repeated
by
you
with
voice
this
kind
of
composition
unknown
to
others
did
he
invent
o
phoebus
mayst
thou
so
will
it
so
too
ye
benignant
divinities
of
the
poets
bacchus
graceful
with
thy
horns
and
you
ye
nine
goddesses
who
can
doubt
that
i
should
wish
the
falr
one
to
know
how
to
dance
that
the
wine
placed
on
table
she
may
move
her
arms
in
cadence
when
requested
masters
of
posture
the
representations
on
the
stage
are
much
valued
so
much
gracefulness
does
that
pliant
art
possess
i
am
ashamed
to
advise
on
trifling
points
to
understand
how
to
throw
a
cast
of
dice
and
thy
value
the
cube
when
thrown
and
now
let
her
throw
the
three
numbers
now
let
her
consider
at
which
number
she
can
cleverly
enter
most
conveniently
and
which
one
she
must
call
for
and
with
her
skill
let
her
play
not
amiss
at
the
hostilities
of
the
pieces
when
the
single
man
perishes
between
his
two
enemies
how
the
warrior
too
wages
the
war
when
caught
without
his
companion
and
how
the
enemy
full
oft
retreats
on
the
path
on
which
he
has
begun
let
the
smooth
balls
too
be
poured
into
the
open
net
and
not
a
ball
must
be
moved
but
the
one
which
you
shall
be
lifting
up
there
is
a
kind
of
game
distributed
into
as
many
lines
on
a
small
scale
as
the
fleeting
year
contains
months
a
little
table
receives
three
pebbles
on
each
side
on
which
to
bring
one
own
into
a
straight
line
is
to
gain
the
victory
devise
a
thousand
amusements
is
shocking
for
the
fair
one
not
to
know
how
to
play
many
a
time
while
playing
is
love
commenced
but
the
least
matter
is
how
to
use
the
throws
to
advantage
is
a
task
of
greater
consequence
to
lay
a
restraint
on
one
manners
while
we
are
not
thinking
and
are
revealed
by
our
very
intentness
and
through
the
game
our
feelings
laid
bare
are
exposed
anger
arises
a
disgraceful
failing
and
the
greed
for
gain
quarrels
too
and
strife
and
then
bitter
regrets
recriminations
are
uttered
the
air
resounds
with
the
brawl
and
every
one
for
himself
invokes
the
angry
divinities
there
is
no
trusting
the
tables
and
amid
vows
new
tables
are
called
for
full
oft
too
have
i
seen
cheeks
wet
with
tears
may
jupiter
avert
from
you
indiscretions
so
unbecoming
you
who
have
a
care
to
be
pleasing
to
any
lover
to
the
fair
has
nature
in
softer
mood
assigned
these
amusements
with
materials
more
abundant
do
the
men
disport
they
have
both
the
flying
ball
and
the
javelin
and
the
hoop
and
arms
and
the
horse
trained
to
go
round
the
ring
no
plain
of
mars
receives
you
nor
does
the
spring
of
the
virgin
so
intensely
cold
nor
does
the
etrurian
river
carry
you
along
with
its
smooth
stream
but
you
are
allowed
and
it
is
to
your
advantage
to
go
in
the
shade
of
portico
at
the
time
when
the
head
is
heated
by
the
steeds
of
the
constellation
of
the
virgin
frequent
the
palatium
consecrated
to
the
phoebus
was
he
that
overwhelmed
in
the
deep
the
ships
of
parsetonium
the
memorials
also
which
the
bister
and
the
wife
of
our
ruler
have
erected
his
too
his
head
encircled
with
naval
honors
frequent
the
altars
of
the
memphian
heifer
that
smoke
with
frankincense
frequent
the
three
theatres
in
conspicuous
positions
let
the
sand
stained
with
the
warm
blood
have
you
for
spectators
the
goal
also
to
be
passed
with
the
glowing
wheels
that
which
lies
hid
is
unknown
for
what
is
not
known
there
is
no
desire
all
advantage
is
lost
when
a
pretty
face
is
without
one
to
see
it
were
you
to
excel
even
thamyras
and
amcebeus
in
your
singing
there
would
be
no
great
regard
for
your
lyre
while
unknown
if
apelles
of
cos
had
never
painted
venus
she
would
have
lain
concealed
beneath
the
ocean
waves
what
but
fame
alone
is
sought
by
the
hallowed
poets
the
sum
of
all
my
labours
has
that
crowning
object
in
former
days
poets
were
the
care
of
rulers
and
of
kings
and
the
choirs
of
old
received
great
rewards
hallowed
was
the
dignity
and
venerable
the
name
of
the
poets
and
upon
them
great
riches
were
often
bestowed
ennius
born
in
the
mountains
of
calabria
was
deemed
worthy
great
scipio
to
be
placed
near
to
thee
at
the
present
day
the
ivy
lies
abandoned
without
any
honor
and
the
laborious
anxiety
that
toils
for
the
learned
muses
receives
the
appellation
of
idleness
but
be
it
our
study
to
lie
on
the
watch
for
fame
who
would
have
known
of
homer
if
the
iliad
a
work
had
lain
concealed
who
would
have
known
of
danâe
if
she
had
been
for
ever
shut
up
and
if
till
an
old
woman
she
had
continued
concealed
in
her
tower
the
throng
ye
beauteous
fair
is
advantageous
to
you
turn
your
wandering
steps
full
oft
beyond
your
thresholds
the
goes
on
her
way
to
the
many
sheep
that
she
may
carry
off
but
one
and
the
bird
of
jove
pounces
down
upon
the
many
birds
let
the
handsome
woman
too
present
herself
to
be
seen
by
the
public
out
of
so
many
perhaps
there
will
be
one
for
her
to
attract
in
all
places
let
her
ever
be
desirous
to
please
and
with
all
attention
let
her
have
a
care
for
her
charms
chance
is
powerful
everywhere
let
your
hook
be
always
hanging
ready
in
waters
where
you
least
think
it
there
will
be
a
fish
many
a
time
do
the
hounds
wander
in
vain
over
the
woody
mountains
and
sometimes
the
stag
falls
in
the
toils
with
no
one
to
pursue
him
what
was
there
for
andromeda
when
bound
less
to
hope
for
than
that
her
tears
could
possibly
charm
any
one
many
a

at
the
funeral
of
a
husband
is
another
husband
found
to
go
with
the
tresses
dishevelled
and
not
to
withhold
your
lamentations
is
becoming
but
avoid
those
men
who
make
dress
and
good
looks
their
study
and
who
arrange
their
locks
each
in
its
own
position
what
they
say
to
you
they
have
repeated
to
a
thousand
damsels
their
love
is
roving
and
remains
firm
in
no
one
spot
what
is
the
woman
to
do
when
the
man
himself
is
still
more
effeminate
and
himself
perchance
may
have
still
more
male
admirers
you
will
hardly
believe
me
but
still
do
believe
me
troy
would
have
been
still
remaining
if
it
had
followed
the
advice
of
its
own
priam
there
are
some
men
who
range
about
under
a
fictitious
appearance
of
love
and
by
means
of
such
introductions
seek
disgraceful
lucre
and
do
not
let
the
locks
deceive
you
shining
much
with
the
liquid
nard
nor
yet
the
narrow
belt
pressed
upon
the
folds
of
their
dress
nor
let
the
robe
of
finest
texture
beguile
you
nor
yet
if
there
shall
be
many
and
many
a
ring
on
their
fingers
perhaps
the
best
dressed
of
the
number
of
these
may
be
some
thief
and
may
be
attracted
by
a
desire
for
your
clothes
give
me
back
my
property
full
oft
do
the
plundered
fair
ones
cry
give
me
back
my
property
the
whole
forum
resounding
with
their
cries
thou
venus
unmoved
and
you
ye
goddesses
hear
the
appian
way
from
your
temples
blazing
with
plenteous
gold
behold
these
disputes
there
are
even
certain
names
notorious
by
a
reputation
that
admits
of
no
doubt
those
females
who
have
been
deceived
by
many
share
the
criminality
of
their
favorites
learn
then
from
the
complaints
of
others
to
have
apprehensions
for
yourselves
and
do
not
let
your
door
be
open
to
the
knavish
man
refrain
cecropian
fair
from
believing
theseus
when
he
swears
the
gods
whom
he
will
make
his
witnesses
he
has
made
so
before
and
no
trust
is
there
left
for
thee
demophoôn
heir
to
the
criminality
of
theseus
since
phyllis
has
been
deceived
if
they
are
lavish
of
their
promises
in
just
as
many
words
do
you
promise
them
if
they
give
do
you
too
give
the
promised
favours
that
woman
could
extinguish
the
watchful
flames
of
vesta
and
could
bear
off
the
sacred
things
daughter
of
inachus
from
thy
temples
and
could
administer
to
her
husband
the
aconite
mixed
with
the
pounded
hemlock
if
on
receiving
a
present
she
could
deny
a
favour
my
feelings
are
prompting
me
to
go
too
close
check
the
rein
my
muse
and
be
not
hurled
headlong
by
the
wheels
in
their
full
career
should
lines
written
on
the
tablets
made
of
fir
try
the
soundings
let
a
maid
suited
for
the
duty
take
in
the
billets
that
are
sent
examine
them
and
collect
from
the
words
themselves
whether
he
only
pretends
what
you
are
reading
or
whether
he
entreats
anxiously
and
with
sincerity
and
after
a
short
delay
write
an
answer
delay
ever
stimulates
those
in
love
if
it
lasts
only
for
a
short
time
but
neither
do
you
make
yourself
too
cheap
to
the
youth
who
entreats
nor
yet
refuse
with
disdainful
lips
what
he
is
pressing
for
cause
him
both
to
fear
and
to
hope
at
the
same
moment
and
oft
as
you
refuse
him
let
hopes
more
assured
and
diminished
apprehensions
arise
write
your
words
ye
fair
in
a
legible
hand
but
of
common
parlance
and
such
as
are
usual
the
recognized
forms
of
language
are
most
ah
how
oft
has
the
wavering
lover
been
inflamed
by
a
letter
and
how
oft
has
uncouth
language
proved
detrimental
to
a
graceful
form
but
since
although
you
are
without
the
honors
of
the
fillet
of
chastity
it
is
still
your
care
to
deceive
your
husbands
let
the
skilled
hand
of
a
maid
or
of
a
boy
carry
the
tablets
and
entrust
your
pledges
to
some
unknown
youth
i
myself
have
seen
the
fair
pale
with
terror
on
that
account
enduring
in
their
misery
servitude
to
all
future
time
perfidious
indeed
is
he
who
retains
such
pledges
but
still
in
them
he
has
power
equal
to
the
lightnings
of
ætna
in
my
opinion
deceit
is
allowable
for
the
purpose
of
repelling
deceit
and
the
laws
permit
us
to
take
up
arms
against
the
armed
one
hand
should
be
accustomed
to
write
in
numerous
styles
perdition
to
those
through
whom
this
advice
must
be
given
by
me
nor
is
it
safe
to
write
except
when
the
wax
is
quite
smoothed
over
so
that
the
same
tablet
may
not
contain
two
hands
let
your
lover
be
always
styled
a
female
when
you
write
in
your
billets
let
that
be
she
which
really
is
he
but
i
wish
to
turn
my
attention
from
trifles
to
things
of
more
consequence
and
with
swelling
canvass
to
expand
my
filling
sails
it
conduces
to
good
looks
to
restrain
habits
of
anger
fair
peace
becomes
human
beings
savage
fury
wild
beasts
with
fury
the
features
swell
with
blood
the
veins
grow
black
the
eyes
flash
more
wildly
than
the
gorgonian
fires
pipe
hence
avaunt
thou
art
not
of
so
much
worth
to
me
said
pallas
when
she
saw
her
features
in
the
stream
you
too
if
you
were
to
look
at
your
mirror
in
the
midst
of
your
anger
hardly
could
any
one
distinctly
recognize
her
own
countenance
and
in
no
less
degree
let
not
a
repulsive
haughtiness
sit
upon
your
features
by
alluring
eyes
love
must
be
enticed
believe
me
ye
fair
who
know
it
by
experience
i
hate
immoderate
conceit
full
oft
do
the
features
in
silence
contain
the
germs
of
hatred
look
at
him
who
looks
on
you
smile
sweetly
in
return
to
him
who
smiles
does
he
nod
at
you
do
you
too
return
the
sign
well
understood
when
the
boy
cupid
has
made
these
preludes
laying
aside
his
foils
he
takes
his
sharp
arrows
from
his
quiver
i
hate
the
melancholy
damsels
too
let
ajax
be
charmed
with
tecmessa
us
a
joyous
throng
the
cheerful
woman
captivates
never
should
i
have
asked
thee
andromache
nor
thee
tecmessa
that
one
of
you
would
be
my
mistress
i
seem
hardly
ably
to
believe
it
though
by
your
fruitfulness
i
am
obliged
to
believe
it
that
you
could
have
granted
your
favours
to
your
husbands
and
could
forsooth
that
most
melancholy
woman
say
to
ajax
my
life
and
words
which
are
wont
to
please
the
men
what
forbids
me
to
apply
illustrations
from
great
matters
to
small
ones
and
not
to
be
standing
in
awe
of
the
name
of
a
general
to
this
person
the
skilful
general
has
entrusted
a
hundred
to
be
ruled
with
the
twig
of
vine
to
this
one
so
many
cavalry
to
that
one
he
has
given
the
standard
to
defend
do
you
too
consider
to
what
use
each
of
us
is
suited
and
class
each
one
in
his
assigned
position
let
the
rich
man
give
his
presents
let
him
that
professes
the
law
defend
the
eloquent
man
may
often
plead
the
cause
of
his
client
we
who
compose
verse
verses
alone
let
us
contribute
this
throng
before
all
others
is
susceptible
of
love
far
and
wide
do
we
herald
the
praises
of
the
beauty
that
pleases
us
nemesis
has
fame
cynthia
too
has
fame
the
west
and
the
lands
of
the
east
know
of
lycoris
and
many
a
one
is
enquiring
who
my
corinna
is
besides
all
deceit
is
wanting
in
the
hallowed
poets
and
even
our
art
contributes
to
forming
our
manners
no
ambition
influences
us
no
love
of
gain
despising
the
courts
the
couch
and
the
shade
are
the
objects
of
our
commendation
but
we
are
easily
attracted
and
are
consumed
by
a
lasting
heat
and
we
know
how
to
love
with
a
constancy
most
enduring
indeed
we
have
our
feelngs
softened
by
the
gentle
art
and
our
manners
are
in
conformity
with
our
pursuits
be
kind
ye
fair
to
the
aonian
bards
in
them
there
is
inspiration
and
the
pierian
maids
show
favour
unto
them
in
us
a
divinity
exists
and
we
have
intercourse
with
the
heavens
from
the
realms
of
the
skies
does
that
inspiration
proceed
is
a
crime
to
look
for
a
present
from
the
learned
poets
ah
wretched
me
of
this
crime
no
fair
one
stands
in
dread
still
do
act
the
dissemblers
and
at
the
very
first
sight
do
not
be
ravenous
on
seeing
your
nets
a
new
lover
will
stop
short
but
neither
can
the
rider
manage
with
the
same
reins
the
horse
which
has
but
lately
felt
the
bridle
and
that
which
is
nor
yet
must
the
same
path
be
trod
by
you
in
order
to
captivate
the
feelings
that
are
steadied
by
years
and
inexperienced
youth
the
latter
is
raw
and
now
for
the
first
time
known
in
the
camp
of
love
who
a
tender
prey
has
reached
your
chamber
with
you
alone
is
he
acquainted
to
you
alone
would
he
ever
prove
constant
shun
a
rival
so
long
as
you
alone
shall
possess
him
you
will
be
the
conqueror
both
sovereignties
and
love
do
not
last
long
with
one
to
share
in
them
the
other
the
veteran
soldier
will
love
you
gradually
and
with
moderation
and
he
will
put
up
with
much
that
will
not
be
endured
by
the
novice
he
will
neither
break
down
your
nor
burn
them
with
raging
flames
nor
will
he
fly
at
the
tender
cheek
of
his
mistress
with
his
nails
he
will
neither
tear
his
own
clothes
nor
yet
the
clothes
of
the
fair
nor
will
her
torn
locks
be
a
cause
for
grieving
these
things
befit
boys
who
are
heated
with
youthful
years
and
with
passion
the
other
with
tranquil
feelings
will
put
up
with
cruel
wounds
with
slowly
consuming
fires
will
he
smoulder
just
like
a
damp
torch
or
like
the
wood
that
has
been
cut
down
upon
the
mountain
ridge
this
passion
is
more
sure
the
former
is
and
more
bounteous
with
speedy
hand
do
you
pluck
the
fruit
that
passes
away
let
all
points
be
surrendered
the
gates
we
have
opened
to
the
enemy
and
let
confidence
be
placed
in
this
perfidious
betrayal
that
which
is
easily
conceded
but
badly
supports
a
lasting
passion
a
repulse
must
now
and
then
be
mingled
with
your
joyous
dalliance
let
him
lie
down
before
your
doors
cruel
door
let
him
exclaim
and
let
him
do
many
a
thing
in
humble
many
in
threatening
mood
the
sweet
we
can
not
endure
with
bitter
potions
we
may
be
refreshed
full
oft
does
the
bark
perish
overwhelmed
by
favouring
gales
this
it
is
that
does
not
permit
wives
to
be
loved
husbands
have
access
to
them
whenever
they
please
shut
your
door
and
let
your
porter
say
to
you
with
surly
lips
you
can
not
come
in
desire
will
seize
you
as
well
thus
shut
out
now
lay
aside
the
blunted
swords
let
the
battle
be
fought
with
sharpened
ones
and
i
doubt
not
but
that
i
myself
shall
be
aimed
at
with
weapons
of
my
own
furnishing
while
the
lover
that
has
been
captured
only
of
late
is
falling
into
your
toils
let
him
hope
that
he
alone
has
admission
to
your
chamber
but
soon
let
him
be
aware
of
a
rival
and
a
division
of
the
privileges
of
your
favours
remove
these
contrivances
and
his
passion
will
grow
effete
then
does
the
courser
run
well
the
being
opened
when
he
has
both
competitors
to
pass
by
and
those
for
him
to
follow
harshness
rekindles
the
flame
even
if
gone
out
myself
to
wit
i
confess
it
i
do
not
love
unless
i
am
still
the
cause
for
grief
should
not
be
too
manifest
and
in
his
anxiety
he
ought
to
suspect
that
there
is
more
than
what
he
actually
knows
the
harsh
supervision
too
of
some
feigned
servant
should
excite
him
and
the
irksome
watchfulness
of
a
husband
too
severe
the
pleasure
that
is
enjoyed
in
safety
is
the
least
valued
of
all
though
you
are
more
at
liberty
than
even
thais
still
feign
apprehensions
whereas
you
could
do
it
far
better
by
the
door
admit
him
through
the
window
and
on
your
countenance
show
the
signs
of
fear
let
the
cunning
maid
rush
in
and
exclaim
we
are
undone
and
then
do
you
hide
the
youth
in
his
fright
in
any
spot
still
an
enjoyment
without
anxiety
must
be
interspersed
with
his
alarms
lest
he
should
not
think
your
favours
to
be
worth
so
much
trouble
but
i
was
about
to
omit
by
what
methods
the
cunning
husband
may
be
eluded
and
how
the
watchful
keeper
let
the
wife
stand
in
awe
of
her
husband
let
the
safe
keeping
of
a
wife
be
allowed
that
is
proper
that
the
laws
and
justice
and
decency
ordain
but
for
you
as
well
to
be
watched
whom
the
lictor
rod
has
but
just
set
at
liberty
who
can
endure
it
come
to
my
sacred
rites
that
you
may
learn
how
to
deceive
even
if
as
many
eyes
shall
be
watching
you
as
argus
had
if
there
is
only
a
fixed
determination
you
will
deceive
them
all
and
shall
a
keeper
forsooth
hinder
you
from
being
able
to
write
when
an
opportunity
is
given
you
for
taking
the
bath
when
a
female
confidant
can
carry
the
note
you
have
penned
which
her
broad
girth
can
conceal
in
her
warm
bosom
when
she
can
conceal
the
paper
fastened
to
her
calf
and
carry
the
tender
note
beneath
her
sandalled
foot
should
the
keeper
be
proof
against
these
in
place
of
paper
let
your
confidant
afford
her
shoulders
and
upon
her
own
person
let
her
carry
your
words
letters
too
written
in
new
milk
are
safe
and
escape
the
eye
touch
them
with
powdered
coals
and
you
will
read
them
the
writing
too
which
is
made
with
the
stalk
of
wetted
flax
will
deceive
and
the
clean
surface
will
bear
the
secret
marks
the
care
of
watching
a
fair
one
fell
to
acrisius
still
through
his
own
fault
did
she
make
him
a
grandsire
what
can
a
keeper
do
when
there
are
so
many
theatres
in
the
city
when
eagerly
she
is
a
spectator
of
the
harnessed
steeds
when
she
is
sitting
in
attendance
upon
the
sistra
of
the
pharian
heifer
and
at
the
place
where
her
male
friends
are
forbidden
to
go
while
too
the
good
goddess
expels
the
gaze
of
males
from
her
temples
except
any
that
perchance
she
bids
to
come
while
as
the
keeper
watches
outside
the
clothes
of
the
fair
the
baths
may
in
safety
conceal
the
lovers
who
are
hiding
there
while
so
often
as
is
requisite
some
pretended
may
be
sick
and
ill
as
she
is
may
give
place
for
her
in
her
couch
while
the
false
key
too
tells
by
its
name
what
we
are
to
do
and
it
is
not
the
door
alone
that
gives
the
access
you
require
the
watchfulness
of
the
keeper
is
eluded
by
plenty
of
wine
even
though
the
grapes
be
gathered
on
the
hills
of
spain
there
are
drugs
too
which
create
deep
sleep
and
let
them
close
the
eyes
overpowered
by
lethæan
night
and
not
amiss
does
the
confidant
occupy
the
troublesome
fellow
with
dalliance
to
create
delay
and
in
his
company
spins
out
the
time
what
need
is
there
to
be
teaching
stratagems
and
trifling
precepts
when
the
keeper
may
be
purchased
by
the
smallest
present
believe
me
presents
influence
both
men
and
gods
on
gifts
being
presented
jupiter
himself
is
appeased
what
is
the
wise
man
to
do
when
even
the
fool
is
gratified
with
a
present
the
husband
himself
on
receiving
a
present
will
be
silent
but
once
only
throughout
the
long
year
must
the
keeper
be
bought
full
oft
will
he
hold
out
the
hand
which
he
has
once
extended
i
complained
i
recollect
that
friends
are
to
be
dreaded
that
complaint
does
not
extend
to
men
alone
if
you
are
too
trusting
other
women
will
interrupt
your
pleasures
and
this
hare
of
yours
will
be
destined
to
be
hunted
down
by
other
persons
even
she
who
so
obligingly
lends
her
couch
and
her
room
believe
me
has
not
once
only
been
in
my
company
and
do
not
let
too
pretty
a
maid
wait
upon
you
many
a
time
has
she
filled
her
mistress
place
for
me
whither
in
my
folly
am
i
led
on
why
with
bared
breast
do
i
strive
against
the
foe
and
why
myself
am
i
betrayed
through
information
that
is
my

not
instruct
the
fowler
in
which
direction
he
may

so
for
us
to
believe
ourselves

belief
arises
readily
in
those
who
are
anxious
for
the
fulfilment
of
their
desires
let
the
fair
one
eye
the
youth
in
a
kindly
manner
let
her
heave
sighs
from
her
very
heart
and
let
her
enquire
why
it
is
he
comes
so
late
let
tears
be
added
too
and
feigned
apprehensions
about
a
rival
and
with
her
fingers
let
her
tear
her
face
soon
will
he
be
thoroughly
persuaded
one
he
will
pity
you
of
his
own
accord
and
will
say
to
himself
this
woman
is
consumed
by
affection
for
me
especially
if
he
shall
be
well
drest
and
shall
please
himself
at
the
he
will
believe
that
the
goddesses
might
be
touched
with
love
for
him
but
whoever
you
are
let
an
injury
disturb
you
only
in
a
moderate
degree
and
do
on
hearing
of
a
rival
go
out
of
your
mind
and
do
at
once
believe
it
how
injurious
it
is
at
once
to
believe
things
procris
will
be
no
slight
proof
to
you
there
is
near
the
empurpled
hills
of
blooming
hymettus
a
sacred
spring
and
the
ground
is
soft
with
the
verdant
turf
the
wood
of
no
great
height
there
forms
a
grove
the
strawberry
tree
overshadows
the
grass
rosemary
and
laurels
and
swarthy
myrtles
give
their
perfume
neither
the
with
their
thick
foliage
and
the
slender
tamarisks
nor
yet
the
tiny
trefoil
and
the
garden
pine
are
wanting
there
moved
by
the
gentle
zephyrs
and
the
balmy
air
the
leaves
of
these
many
kinds
and
the
tops
of
the
grass
quiver
pleasant
was
this
retreat
to
cephalus
his
servants
and
his
hounds
left
behind
the
youth
when
weary
often
sat
down
in
this
spot
and
here
he
was
in
the
habit
of
repeating
come
gentle
aura
breeze
to
be
received
in
my
bosom
that
thou
mayst
moderate
my
heat
some
person
maliciously
officious
with
retentive
lips
carried
the
words
he
had
heard
to
the
timid
ears
of
his
wife
procris
when
she
heard
the
name
of
aura
breeze
as
though
of
a
rival
fainted
away
and
with
this
sudden
apprehension
she
was
mute
she
turned
pale
just
as
the
late
leaves
become
wan
which
the
coming
winter
has
nipped
the
clusters
now
gathered
from
the
vine
and
as
the
quinces
which
in
their
ripeness
are
bending
their
boughs
and
as
the
cornels
not
yet
quite
fit
for
food
for
man
when
her
senses
had
returned
she
tore
her
thin
garments
from
off
her
body
with
her
nails
and
wounded
her
guiltless
cheeks
and
no
delay
was
there
raving
with
dishevelled
locks
she
flew
amid
the
tracks
like
a
bacchanal
aroused
by
the
thyrsus
when
she
had
come
near
the
spot
she
left
her
attendants
in
the
valley
and
with
silent
footsteps
in
her
boldness
she
herself
stealthily
entered
the
grove
what
procris
were
thy
feelings
when
thus
in
thy
frenzy
thou
didst
he
concealed
what
the
impulse
of
thy
disquieted
breast
each
moment
forsooth
wast
thou
expecting
that
she
would
come
whoever
aura
might
be
and
that
their
criminality
would
be
witnessed
with
thine
eyes
now
dost
thou
repent
of
having
come
for
indeed
thou
wouldst
not
wish
to
detect
him
and
now
thou
art
glad
fluctuating
affection
is
tormenting
thy
breast
there
is
the
spot
and
the
name
and
the
informant
to
bid
thee
give
credence
and
the
fact
that
the
lover
always
apprehends
that
to
exist
which
he
dreads
when
she
beheld
the
grass
beaten
down
the
impress
of
his
body
her
trembling
bosom
was
throbbing
with
her
palpitating
heart
and
now
midday
had
made
the
unsubstantial
shadows
small
and
at
an
equal
distance
were
the
evening
and
the
morn
behold
cephalus
the
offspring
of
the
cyilenian
god
returns
from
the
woods
and
sprinkles
his
glowing
face
with
water
of
the
fountain
in
thy
anxiety
procris
art
thou
lying
concealed
along
the
grass
he
lies
as
wont
and
says
ye
gentle
zephyrs
and
thou
aura
breeze
come
hither
when
the
welcome
mistake
of
the
name
was
thus
revealed
to
the
sorrowing
fair
both
her
senses
and
the
real
colour
of
her
face
returned
she
arose
and
the
wife
about
to
rush
into
the
embrace
of
her
husband
by
the
moving
of
her
body
shook
the
leaves
that
were
in
her
way
he
thinking
that
a
wild
beast
had
made
the
noise
with
alacrity
snatched
up
his
bow
his
arrows
were
in
his
right
hand
what
wretched
man
art
thou
about
is
no
wild
beast
keep
still
thy
weapons
ah
wretched
me
by
thy
dart
has
the
fair
been
pierced
ah
me
she
cries
aloud
a
loving
heart
hast
thou
pierced
that
spot
has
ever
retained
the
wound
inflicted
by
cephalus
before
my
time
i
die
but
injured
by
no
rival
this
o
earth
will
make
thee
light
when
i
am
entombed
now
is
my
breath
departing
in
the
breeze
that
i
had
thus
suspected
i
sink
alas
close
my
eyes
with
those
dear
hands
in
his
sorrowing
bosom
he
supports
the
dying
body
of
his
spouse
and
with
his
tears
he
bathes
her
cruel
wounds
her
breath
departs
and
gradually
fleeting
from
her
senseless
breast
her
breath
is
received
into
the
mouth
of
her
wretched
husband
but
let
us
return
to
our
path
i
must
deal
with
my
subject
undisguised
that
my
wearied
bark
may
reach
its
port
you
may
be
waiting
in
fact
for
me
to
escort
you
to
the
banquet
and
may
be
requesting
my
advice
in
this
respect
as
well
come
late
and
enter
when
the
lights
are
brought
in
delay
is
a
friend
to
passion
a
very
great
stimulant
is
delay
even
should
you
be
ugly

the
tipsy
you
will
appear
charming
and
night
itself
will
afford
a
concealment
for
your
imperfections
take
up
your
food
with
your
fingers
the
method
of
eating
is
something
and
do
not
besmear
all
your
face
with
your
dirty
hand
and
do
not
first
take
food
at
home
but
cease
to
eat
a
little
sooner
than
you
could
wish
and
could
have
eaten
had
the
son
of
priam
seen
helen
greedily
devouring
he
would
have
detested
her
and
he
would
have
said
that
prize
of
mine
is
an
oaf
it
is
more
proper
and
is
more
becoming
for
the
fair
to
drink
to
excess

each

a
