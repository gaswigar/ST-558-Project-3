my
dear
le
grand
you
and
i
were
early
drawn
together
by
a
common
love
of
nature
your
researches
into
the
natural
history
of
the
your
observations
upon
the
of
providence
township
your
experiments
with
the
lobster
all
stimulated
my
enthusiasm
in
a
scientific
direction
which
has
crystallized
in
this
helpful
little
book
dedicated
to
you
pray
accept
it
as
an
insignificant
payment
on
account
for
all
i
owe
to
you
the
author
preface
it
appears
to
the
writer
that
there
is
urgent
need
of
more
nature
books
books
that
are
scraped
clear
of
fiction
and
which
display
only
the
carefully
articulated
skeleton
of
fact
hence
this
little
volume
presented
with
some
hesitation
and
more
modesty
various
chapters
have
at
intervals
appeared
in
the
pages
of
various
publications
the
continued
narrative
is
now
published
for
the
first
time
and
the
writer
trusts
that
it
may
inspire
enthusiasm
for
natural
and
scientific
research
and
inculcate
a
passion
for
accurate
observation
among
the
young
the
author
where
the
slanting
forest
eaves
shingled
tight
with
greenest
leaves
sweep
the
scented
let
us
snoop
along
the
edge
let
us
pry
in
hidden
nooks
laden
with
our
nature
books
scaring
birds
with
happy
cries
chloroforming
butterflies
rooting
up
each
woodland
plant
pinning
beetle
fly
and
ant
so
we
may
identify
what
we
ruined
in
search
of
the
unknown
i
because
it
all
seems
so
improbable
so
horribly
impossible
to
me
now
sitting
here
safe
and
sane
in
my
own
library
i
hesitate
to
record
an
episode
which
already
appears
to
me
less
horrible
than
grotesque
yet
unless
this
story
is
written
now
i
know
i
shall
never
have
the
courage
to
tell
the
truth
about
the
matter
not
from
fear
of
ridicule
but
because
i
myself
shall
soon
cease
to
credit
what
i
now
know
to
be
true
yet
scarcely
a
month
has
elapsed
since
i
heard
the
stealthy
purring
of
what
i
believed
to
be
the
shoaling
undertow
scarcely
a
month
ago
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
that
which
even
now
i
am
beginning
to
believe
never
existed
as
for
the
and
the
blow
i
am
now
striking
at
the
old
order
of
things
but
of
that
i
shall
not
speak
now
or
later
i
shall
try
to
tell
the
story
simply
and
truthfully
and
let
my
friends
testify
as
to
my
probity
and
the
publishers
of
this
book
corroborate
them
on
the
of
february
i
resigned
my
position
under
the
government
and
left
washington
to
accept
an
offer
from
professor
farrago
whose
name
he
kindly
permits
me
to
use
and
on
the
first
day
of
april
i
entered
upon
my
new
and
congenial
duties
as
general
superintendent
of
the
department
connected
with
the
zoological
gardens
then
in
course
of
erection
at
bronx
park
new
york
for
a
week
i
followed
the
routine
examining
the
new
foundations
studying
the
architect
plans
following
the
surveyors
through
the
bronx
thickets
suggesting
arrangements
for
and
pools
destined
to
be
included
in
the
enclosures
for
swans
geese
pelicans
herons
and
such
of
the
waders
and
swimmers
as
we
might
expect
to
acclimate
in
bronx
park
it
was
at
that
time
the
policy
of
the
trustees
and
officers
of
the
zoological
gardens
neither
to
employ
collectors
nor
to
send
out
expeditions
in
search
of
specimens
the
society
decided
to
depend
upon
voluntary
contributions
and
i
was
always
busy
part
of
the
day
in
dictating
answers
to
correspondents
who
wrote
offering
their
services
as
hunters
of
big
game
collectors
of
all
sorts
of
fauna
trappers
snarers
and
also
to
those
who
offered
specimens
for
sale
usually
at
exorbitant
rates
to
the
proprietors
of
kittens
mangy
lynxes
coyotes
and
dancing
bears
i
returned
courteous
but
uncompromising
refusals
of
course
first
submitting
all
such
letters
together
with
my
replies
to
professor
farrago
one
day
towards
the
end
of
may
however
just
as
i
was
leaving
bronx
park
to
return
to
town
professor
lesard
of
the
reptilian
department
called
out
to
me
that
professor
farrago
wanted
to
see
me
a
moment
so
i
put
my
pipe
into
my
pocket
again
and
retraced
my
steps
to
the
temporary
wooden
building
occupied
by
professor
farrago
general
superintendent
of
the
zoological
gardens
the
professor
who
was
sitting
at
his
desk
before
a
pile
of
letters
and
replies
submitted
for
approval
by
me
pushed
his
glasses
down
and
looked
over
them
at
me
with
a
whimsical
smile
that
suggested
amusement
impatience
annoyance
and
perhaps
a
faint
trace
of
apology
now
here
a
letter
he
said
with
a
deliberate
gesture
towards
a
sheet
of
paper
impaled
on
a
file
a
letter
that
i
suppose
you
remember
he
disengaged
the
sheet
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
me
oh
yes
i
replied
with
a
shrug
of
course
the
man
is
mistaken
or
or
what
demanded
professor
farrago
tranquilly
wiping
his
or
a
liar
i
replied
after
a
silence
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
bade
me
read
the
letter
to
him
again
and
i
did
so
with
a
contemptuous
tolerance
for
the
writer
who
must
have
been
either
a
very
innocent
victim
or
a
very
stupid
swindler
i
said
as
much
to
professor
farrago
but
to
my
surprise
he
appeared
to
waver
i
suppose
he
said
with
his
embarrassed
smile
that
nine
hundred
and
men
in
a
thousand
would
throw
that
letter
aside
and
condemn
the
writer
as
a
liar
or
a
fool
in
my
opinion
said
i
he
one
or
the
other
he
is
in
mine
said
the
professor
placidly
what
i
exclaimed
here
is
a
man
living
all
alone
on
a
strip
of
rock
and
sand
between
the
wilderness
and
the
sea
who
wants
you
to
send
somebody
to
take
charge
of
a
bird
that
does
exist
how
do
you
know
asked
professor
farrago
that
the
bird
in
question
does
not
exist
it
is
generally
accepted
i
replied
sarcastically
that
the
great
auk
has
been
extinct
for
years
therefore
i
may
be
pardoned
for
doubting
that
our
correspondent
possesses
a
pair
of
them
alive
oh
you
young
fellows
said
the
professor
smiling
wearily
you
embark
on
a
theory
for
destinations
that
do
exist
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
amused
eyes
searching
space
for
the
imagery
that
made
him
smile
like
swimming
squirrels
you
navigate
with
the
help
of
heaven
and
a
stiff
breeze
but
you
never
land
where
you
hope
to
do
you
rather
red
in
the
face
i
said
do
you
believe
the
great
auk
to
be
extinct
audubon
saw
the
great
auk
who
has
seen
a
single
specimen
since
nobody
except
our
correspondent
here
he
replied
laughing
i
laughed
too
considering
the
interview
at
an
end
but
the
professor
went
on
coolly
whatever
it
is
that
our
correspondent
has
and
i
am
daring
to
believe
that
it
the
great
auk
itself
i
want
you
to
secure
it
for
the
society
when
my
astonishment
subsided
my
first
conscious
sentiment
was
one
of
pity
clearly
professor
farrago
was
on
the
verge
of
dotage
ah
what
a
loss
to
the
world
i
believe
now
that
professor
farrago
perfectly
interpreted
my
thoughts
but
he
betrayed
neither
resentment
nor
impatience
i
drew
a
chair
up
beside
his
desk
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
and
this
fool
errand
was
none
of
my
conceiving
together
we
made
out
a
list
of
articles
necessary
for
me
and
itemized
the
expenses
i
might
incur
and
i
set
a
date
for
my
return
allowing
no
margin
for
a
successful
termination
to
the
expedition
never
mind
that
said
the
professor
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
get
those
birds
here
safely
now
how
many
men
will
you
take
none
i
replied
bluntly
it
a
useless
expense
unless
there
is
something
to
bring
back
if
there
is
i
wire
you
you
may
be
sure
very
well
said
professor
farrago
you
shall
have
all
the
assistance
you
may
require
can
you
leave
the
old
gentleman
was
certainly
prompt
i
nodded
aware
of
his
amusement
so
i
said
picking
up
my
hat
i
am
to
start
north
to
find
a
place
called
black
harbor
where
there
is
a
man
named
halyard
who
possesses
among
other
household
utensils
two
extinct
great
auks
we
were
both
laughing
by
this
time
i
asked
him
why
on
earth
he
credited
the
assertion
of
a
man
he
had
never
before
heard
of
i
suppose
he
replied
with
the
same
smile
it
is
instinct
i
feel
somehow
that
this
man
halyard
got
an
auk
perhaps
two
i
ca
get
away
from
the
idea
that
we
are
on
the
eve
of
acquiring
the
rarest
of
living
creatures
it
odd
for
a
scientist
to
talk
as
i
do
doubtless
you
shocked
admit
it
now
but
i
was
not
shocked
on
the
contrary
i
was
conscious
that
the
same
strange
hope
that
professor
farrago
cherished
was
beginning
in
spite
of
me
to
stir
my
pulses
too
if
he
has
i
began
then
stopped
the
professor
and
i
looked
hard
at
each
other
in
silence
go
on
he
said
encouragingly
but
i
had
nothing
more
to
say
for
the
prospect
of
beholding
with
my
own
eyes
a
living
specimen
of
the
great
auk
produced
a
series
of
conflicting
emotions
within
me
which
rendered
speech
profanely
superfluous
as
i
took
my
leave
professor
farrago
came
to
the
door
of
the
temporary
wooden
office
and
handed
me
the
letter
written
by
the
man
halyard
i
folded
it
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
as
halyard
might
require
it
for
my
own
identification
how
much
does
he
want
for
the
pair
i
asked
ten
thousand
dollars
do
demur
if
the
birds
are
really
i
know
i
said
hastily
not
daring
to
hope
too
much
one
thing
more
said
professor
farrago
gravely
you
know
in
that
last
paragraph
of
his
letter
halyard
speaks
of
something
else
in
the
way
of
specimens
an
undiscovered
species
of
amphibious
biped
just
read
that
paragraph
again
will
you
i
drew
the
letter
from
my
pocket
and
read
as
he
directed
when
you
have
seen
the
two
living
specimens
of
the
great
auk
and
have
satisfied
yourself
that
i
tell
the
truth
you
may
be
wise
enough
to
listen
without
prejudice
to
a
statement
i
shall
make
concerning
the
existence
of
the
strangest
creature
ever
fashioned
i
will
merely
say
at
this
time
that
the
creature
referred
to
is
an
amphibious
biped
and
inhabits
the
ocean
near
this
coast
more
i
can
not
say
for
i
personally
have
not
seen
the
animal
but
i
have
a
witness
who
has
and
there
are
many
who
affirm
that
they
have
seen
the
creature
you
will
naturally
say
that
my
statement
amounts
to
nothing
but
when
your
representative
arrives
if
he
be
free
from
prejudice
i
expect
his
reports
to
you
concerning
this
will
confirm
the
solemn
statements
of
a
witness
i
to
be
unimpeachable
yours
truly
burton
halyard
black
harbor
well
i
said
after
a
moment
thought
here
goes
for
the
chase
wild
auk
you
mean
said
professor
farrago
shaking
hands
with
me
you
will
start
wo
you
yes
but
heaven
knows
how
i
ever
going
to
land
in
this
man
halyard
about
that
began
professor
farrago
shyly
oh
do
i
said
i
can
swallow
the
auks
feathers
and
claws
but
if
this
fellow
halyard
is
hinting
he
seen
an
amphibious
creature
resembling
a
man
or
a
woman
said
the
professor
cautiously
i
retired
disgusted
my
faith
shaken
in
the
mental
vigor
of
professor
farrago
ii
the
three
days
voyage
by
boat
and
rail
was
irksome
i
bought
my
kit
at
sainte
croix
on
the
central
pacific
railroad
and
on
june
i
began
the
last
stage
of
my
journey
the
sainte
isole
arriving
in
the
wilderness
by
daylight
a
tedious
forced
march
by
blazed
trail
freshly
spotted
on
the
wrong
side
of
course
brought
me
to
the
northern
terminus
of
the
rusty
lumber
railway
which
runs
from
the
heart
of
the
hushed
pine
wilderness
to
the
sea
already
a
long
train
of
battered
piled
with
and
roughly
hewn
sleepers
was
moving
slowly
off
into
the
brooding
forest
gloom
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
track
but
i
developed
a
gratifying
and
unexpected
burst
of
speed
shouting
all
the
while
the
train
stopped
i
swung
myself
aboard
the
last
car
where
a
pleasant
young
fellow
was
sitting
on
the
rear
brake
chewing
spruce
and
reading
a
letter
come
aboard
sir
he
said
looking
up
with
a
smile
i
guess
the
man
in
a
hurry
i
looking
for
a
man
named
halyard
i
said
dropping
rifle
and
knapsack
on
the
fragrant
pile
of
pine
are
you
halyard
no
i
francis
lee
bossing
the
mica
pit
at
he
replied
but
this
letter
is
from
halyard
asking
me
to
look
out
for
a
man
in
a
hurry
from
bronx
park
new
york
i
that
man
said
i
filling
my
pipe
and
offering
him
a
share
of
the
weed
of
peace
and
we
sat
side
by
side
smoking
very
amiably
until
a
signal
from
the
locomotive
sent
him
forward
and
i
was
left
alone
lounging
at
ease
head
pillowed
on
both
arms
watching
the
blue
sky
flying
through
the
branches
overhead
long
before
we
came
in
sight
of
the
ocean
i
smelled
it
the
fresh
salt
aroma
stole
into
my
senses
drowsy
with
the
heated
odor
of
pine
and
hemlock
and
i
sat
up
peering
ahead
into
the
dusky
sea
of
pines
fresher
and
fresher
came
the
wind
from
the
sea
in
puffs
in
mild
sweet
breezes
in
steady
freshening
currents
blowing
the
feathery
crowns
of
the
pines
setting
the
balsam
blue
tufts
rocking
lee
wandered
back
over
the
long
line
of
flats
balancing
himself
nonchalantly
as
the
cars
swung
around
a
sharp
curve
where
water
dripped
from
a
newly
propped
sluice
that
suddenly
emerged
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
to
run
parallel
to
the
railroad
track
built
it
this
spring
he
said
surveying
his
handiwork
which
seemed
to
undulate
as
the
cars
swept
past
it
runs
to
the
cove
or
ought
to
he
stopped
abruptly
with
a
thoughtful
glance
at
me
so
you
going
over
to
halyard
he
continued
as
though
answering
a
question
asked
by
himself
i
nodded
you
never
been
there
of
course
no
i
said
and
i
not
likely
to
go
again
i
would
have
told
him
why
i
was
going
if
i
had
not
already
begun
to
feel
ashamed
of
my
idiotic
errand
i
guess
you
going
to
look
at
those
birds
of
his
continued
lee
placidly
i
guess
i
am
i
said
sulkily
glancing
askance
to
see
whether
he
was
smiling
but
he
only
asked
me
quite
seriously
whether
a
great
auk
was
really
a
very
rare
bird
and
i
told
him
that
the
last
one
ever
seen
had
been
found
dead
off
labrador
in
january
then
i
asked
him
whether
these
birds
of
halyard
were
really
great
auks
and
he
replied
somewhat
indifferently
that
he
supposed
they
were
at
least
nobody
had
ever
before
seen
such
birds
near
there
something
else
he
said
running
a
through
his
something
that
interests
us
all
here
more
than
auks
big
or
little
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
speak
of
it
as
you
are
bound
to
hear
about
it
sooner
or
later
he
hesitated
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
embarrassed
searching
for
the
exact
words
to
convey
his
meaning
if
said
i
you
have
anything
in
this
region
more
important
to
science
than
the
great
auk
i
should
be
very
glad
to
know
about
it
perhaps
there
was
the
faintest
tinge
of
sarcasm
in
my
voice
for
he
shot
a
sharp
glance
at
me
and
then
turned
slightly
after
a
moment
however
he
put
his
pipe
into
his
pocket
laid
hold
of
the
brake
with
both
hands
vaulted
to
his
perch
aloft
and
glanced
down
at
me
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
he
asked
maliciously
which
i
inquired
you
know
before
long
he
observed
with
a
satisfied
glance
into
perspective
this
rather
extraordinary
observation
puzzled
me
i
waited
for
him
to
resume
and
as
he
did
not
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
if
i
knew
he
said
i
tell
you
but
come
to
think
of
it
i
be
a
fool
to
go
into
details
with
a
scientific
man
you
hear
about
the
perhaps
you
will
see
the
in
that
event
i
should
be
glad
to
converse
with
you
on
the
subject
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
his
prim
and
precise
manner
and
after
a
moment
he
also
laughed
saying
it
hurts
a
man
vanity
to
know
he
knows
a
thing
that
somebody
else
knows
he
does
know
i
damned
if
i
say
another
word
about
the
until
you
been
to
halyard
a
i
persisted
is
an
official
who
superintends
the
mooring
of
ships
is
he
but
he
refused
to
be
tempted
into
conversation
and
we
lounged
silently
on
the
lumber
until
a
long
thin
whistle
from
the
locomotive
and
a
rush
of
stinging
brought
us
to
our
feet
through
the
trees
i
could
see
the
ocean
stretching
out
beyond
black
headlands
to
meet
the
clouds
a
great
wind
was
roaring
among
the
trees
as
the
train
slowly
came
to
a
on
the
edge
of
the
primeval
forest
lee
jumped
to
the
ground
and
aided
me
with
my
rifle
and
pack
and
then
the
train
began
to
back
away
along
a
curved
which
lee
said
led
to
the
and
company
stores
now
what
will
you
do
he
asked
pleasantly
i
can
give
you
a
good
dinner
and
a
decent
bed
if
you
like
and
i
sure
lee
would
be
very
glad
to
have
you
stop
with
us
as
long
as
you
choose
i
thanked
him
but
said
that
i
was
anxious
to
reach
halyard
before
dark
and
he
very
kindly
led
me
along
the
cliffs
and
pointed
out
the
path
this
man
halyard
he
said
is
an
invalid
he
lives
at
a
cove
called
black
harbor
and
all
his
truck
goes
through
to
him
over
the
road
we
receive
it
here
and
send
a
through
once
a
month
i
met
him
he
a
hypochondriac
a
cynic
at
heart
and
a
man
whose
word
is
never
doubted
if
he
says
he
has
a
great
auk
you
may
be
satisfied
he
has
my
heart
was
beating
with
excitement
at
the
prospect
i
looked
out
across
the
wooded
headlands
and
tangled
stretches
of
dune
and
hollow
trying
to
realize
what
it
might
mean
to
me
to
professor
farrago
to
the
world
if
i
should
lead
back
to
new
york
a
live
auk
he
a
crank
said
lee
frankly
i
do
like
him
if
you
find
it
unpleasant
there
come
back
to
us
does
halyard
live
alone
i
asked
yes
except
for
a
professional
trained
nurse
poor
thing
a
man
no
said
lee
disgustedly
presently
he
gave
me
a
peculiar
glance
hesitated
and
finally
said
ask
halyard
to
tell
you
about
his
nurse
and
the
i
due
at
the
quarry
come
and
stay
with
us
whenever
you
care
to
you
will
find
a
welcome
at
we
shook
hands
and
parted
on
the
cliff
he
turning
back
into
the
forest
along
the
railway
i
starting
northward
pack
slung
rifle
over
my
shoulder
once
i
met
a
group
of
quarrymen
faces
burned
scarred
hands
swinging
as
they
walked
and
as
i
passed
them
with
a
nod
turning
i
saw
that
they
also
had
turned
to
look
after
me
and
i
caught
a
word
or
two
of
their
conversation
whirled
back
to
me
on
the
they
were
speaking
of
the
iii
towards
sunset
i
came
out
on
a
sheer
granite
cliff
where
the
were
whirling
and
clamoring
and
the
great
breakers
dashed
rolling
in
reverberations
on
the
crimson
sands
below
the
rock
across
the
of
beach
towered
another
cliff
and
behind
this
i
saw
a
column
of
smoke
rising
in
the
still
air
it
certainly
came
from
halyard
chimney
although
the
opposite
cliff
prevented
me
from
seeing
the
house
itself
i
rested
a
moment
to
refill
my
pipe
then
resumed
rifle
and
pack
and
cautiously
started
to
skirt
the
cliffs
i
had
descended
towards
the
beech
and
was
examining
the
cliff
opposite
when
something
on
the
very
top
of
the
rock
arrested
my
attention
a
man
darkly
outlined
against
the
sky
the
next
moment
however
i
knew
it
could
not
be
a
man
for
the
object
suddenly
glided
over
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
slid
down
the
sheer
smooth
lace
like
a
lizard
before
i
could
get
a
square
look
at
it
the
thing
crawled
into
the
surf
or
at
least
it
seemed
to
but
the
whole
episode
occurred
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
that
i
was
not
sure
i
had
seen
anything
at
all
however
i
was
curious
enough
to
climb
the
cliff
on
the
land
side
and
make
my
way
towards
the
spot
where
i
imagined
i
saw
the
man
of
course
there
was
nothing
there
not
a
trace
of
a
human
being
i
mean
something
been
there
a
possibly
for
the
remains
of
a
freshly
killed
fish
lay
on
the
rock
eaten
to
the
and
tail
the
next
moment
below
me
i
saw
the
house
a
freshly
painted
trim
flimsy
structure
modern
and
very
much
out
of
harmony
with
the
splendid
savagery
surrounding
it
it
struck
a
nasty
cheap
note
in
the
noble
gray
monotony
of
headland
and
sea
the
descent
was
easy
enough
i
crossed
the
crescent
beach
hard
as
pink
marble
and
found
a
little
trodden
path
among
the
rocks
that
led
to
the
front
porch
of
the
house
there
were
two
people
on
the
porch
i
heard
their
voices
before
i
saw
them
and
when
i
set
my
foot
upon
the
wooden
steps
i
saw
one
of
them
a
woman
rise
from
her
chair
and
step
hastily
towards
me
come
back
cried
the
other
a
man
with
a
deeply
lined
face
and
a
pair
of
angry
blue
eyes
and
the
woman
stepped
back
quietly
acknowledging
my
lifted
hat
with
a
silent
inclination
the
man
who
was
reclining
in
an
invalid
clapped
both
large
pale
hands
to
the
wheels
and
pushed
himself
out
along
the
porch
he
had
shawls
pinned
about
him
an
untidy
hat
on
his
head
and
when
he
looked
down
at
me
he
scowled
i
know
who
you
are
he
said
in
his
acid
voice
you
one
of
the
zoological
men
from
bronx
park
you
look
like
it
anyway
it
is
easy
to
recognize
you
from
your
reputation
i
replied
irritated
at
his
discourtesy
really
he
replied
with
something
between
a
sneer
and
a
laugh
obliged
for
your
frankness
you
after
my
great
auks
are
you
not
nothing
else
would
have
tempted
me
into
this
place
i
replied
sincerely
thank
heaven
for
that
he
said
sit
down
a
moment
interrupted
us
then
turning
to
the
young
woman
who
wore
the
neat
gown
and
tiny
cap
of
a
professional
nurse
he
bade
her
resume
what
she
had
been
saying
she
did
so
with
deprecating
glance
at
me
which
made
the
old
man
sneer
again
it
happened
so
suddenly
she
said
in
her
low
voice
that
i
had
no
chance
to
get
back
the
boat
was
drifting
in
the
cove
i
sat
in
the
stern
reading
both
oars
shipped
and
the
tiller
swinging
then
i
heard
a
scratching
under
the
boat
but
thought
it
might
be
and
next
moment
came
those
soft
thumpings
like
the
sound
of
a
big
fish
rubbing
its
nose
against
a
float
halyard
clutched
the
wheels
of
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
girl
in
grim
displeasure
did
you
know
enough
to
be
frightened
he
demanded
no
not
then
she
said
coloring
faintly
but
when
after
a
few
moments
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
running
up
and
down
the
beach
i
was
horribly
frightened
really
said
halyard
sarcastically
it
was
about
time
then
turning
to
me
he
rasped
out
and
that
young
lady
was
obliged
to
row
all
the
way
to
and
call
to
lee
quarrymen
to
take
her
boat
in
completely
mystified
i
looked
from
halyard
to
the
girl
not
in
the
least
comprehending
what
all
this
meant
that
will
do
said
halyard
ungraciously
which
curt
phrase
was
apparently
the
usual
dismissal
for
the
nurse
she
rose
and
i
rose
and
she
passed
me
with
an
inclination
stepping
noiselessly
into
the
house
i
want
bawled
halyard
after
her
then
he
gave
me
an
unamiable
glance
i
was
a
man
he
sneered
i
a
harvard
graduate
too
but
i
live
as
i
like
and
i
do
what
i
like
and
i
say
what
i
like
you
certainly
are
not
reticent
i
said
disgusted
why
should
i
be
he
rasped
i
pay
that
young
woman
for
my
irritability
it
a
bargain
between
us
in
your
domestic
affairs
i
said
there
is
nothing
that
interests
me
i
came
to
see
those
auks
you
probably
believe
them
to
be
auks
he
said
contemptuously
but
they
not
they
great
auks
i
suggested
that
he
permit
me
to
examine
them
and
he
replied
indifferently
that
they
were
in
a
pen
in
his
backyard
and
that
i
was
free
to
step
around
the
house
when
i
cared
to
i
laid
my
rifle
and
pack
on
the
veranda
and
hastened
off
with
mixed
emotions
among
which
hope
no
longer
predominated
no
man
in
his
senses
would
keep
two
such
precious
prizes
in
a
pen
in
his
backyard
i
argued
and
i
was
perfectly
prepared
to
find
anything
from
a
puffin
to
a
penguin
in
that
pen
i
shall
never
forget
as
long
as
i
live
my
stupor
of
amazement
when
i
came
to
the
enclosure
not
only
were
there
two
great
auks
in
the
pen
alive
breathing
squatting
in
bulky
majesty
on
their
bed
but
one
of
them
was
gravely
contemplating
two
newly
hatched
chicks
all
bill
and
feet
which
nestled
sedately
at
the
edge
of
a
puddle
of
where
some
small
fish
were
swimming
for
a
while
excitement
blinded
nay
deafened
me
i
tried
to
realize
that
i
was
gazing
upon
the
last
individuals
of
an
all
but
extinct
race
the
sole
survivors
of
the
gigantic
auk
which
for
thirty
years
has
been
accounted
an
extinct
creature
i
believe
that
i
did
not
move
muscle
nor
limb
until
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
the
crowding
darkness
blurred
my
straining
eyes
and
blotted
the
great
silent
birds
from
sight
even
then
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
the
enclosure
i
listened
to
the
strange
drowsy
note
of
the
male
bird
the
fainter
responses
of
the
female
the
thin
plaints
of
the
chicks
huddling
under
her
breast
i
heard
their
embryotic
wings
beating
sleepily
as
the
birds
stretched
and
yawned
their
beaks
and
clacked
them
preparing
for
slumber
if
you
please
came
a
soft
voice
from
the
door
halyard
awaits
your
company
to
dinner
iv
i
dined
well
or
rather
i
might
have
enjoyed
my
dinner
if
halyard
had
been
eliminated
and
the
feast
consisted
exclusively
of
a
joint
of
beef
the
pretty
nurse
and
myself
she
was
exceedingly
attractive
with
a
disturbing
fashion
of
lowering
her
head
and
raising
her
dark
eyes
when
spoken
to
as
for
halyard
he
was
unspeakable
bundled
up
in
his
snuffy
shawls
and
making
uncouth
noises
over
his
gruel
but
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
his
table
was
worth
sitting
down
to
and
his
wine
was
sound
as
a
bell
yah
he
snapped
i
sick
of
this
cursed
soup
and
i
trouble
you
to
fill
my
glass
it
is
dangerous
for
you
to
touch
claret
said
the
pretty
nurse
i
might
as
well
die
at
dinner
as
anywhere
he
observed
certainly
said
i
cheerfully
passing
the
decanter
but
he
did
not
appear
overpleased
with
the
attention
i
ca
smoke
either
he
snarled
hitching
the
shawls
around
until
he
looked
like
richard
the
third
however
he
was
good
enough
to
shove
a
box
of
cigars
at
me
and
i
took
one
and
stood
up
as
the
pretty
nurse
slipped
past
and
vanished
into
the
little
parlor
beyond
we
sat
there
for
a
while
without
speaking
he
picked
irritably
at
the
on
the
cloth
never
glancing
in
my
direction
and
i
tired
from
my
long
lay
back
in
my
chair
silently
appreciating
one
of
the
best
cigars
i
ever
smoked
well
he
rasped
out
at
length
what
do
you
think
of
my
auks
and
my
veracity
i
told
him
that
both
were
unimpeachable
did
they
call
me
a
swindler
down
there
at
your
museum
he
demanded
i
admitted
that
i
had
heard
the
term
applied
then
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
matter
telling
him
that
it
was
i
who
had
doubted
that
my
chief
professor
farrago
had
sent
me
against
my
will
and
that
i
was
ready
and
glad
to
admit
that
he
halyard
was
a
benefactor
of
the
human
race
bosh
he
said
what
good
does
a
confounded
wobbly
bird
do
to
the
human
race
but
he
was
pleased
nevertheless
and
presently
he
asked
me
not
unamiably
to
punish
his
claret
again
i
done
for
he
said
good
things
to
eat
and
drink
are
no
good
to
me
some
day
i
get
mad
enough
to
have
a
fit
and
then
he
paused
to
yawn
then
he
continued
that
little
nurse
of
mine
will
drink
up
my
claret
and
go
back
to
civilization
where
people
are
polite
somehow
or
other
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
halyard
was
an
old
pig
what
he
said
touched
me
there
was
certainly
not
much
left
in
life
for
him
as
he
regarded
life
i
going
to
leave
her
this
house
he
said
arranging
his
shawls
she
does
know
it
i
going
to
leave
her
my
money
too
she
does
know
that
good
lord
what
kind
of
a
woman
can
she
be
to
stand
my
bad
temper
for
a
few
dollars
a
month
i
think
said
i
that
it
partly
because
she
poor
partly
because
she
sorry
for
you
he
looked
up
with
a
ghastly
smile
you
think
she
really
is
sorry
before
i
could
answer
he
went
on
i
no
mawkish
sentimentalist
and
i
wo
allow
anybody
to
be
sorry
for
me
do
you
hear
oh
i
not
sorry
for
you
i
said
hastily
and
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
seen
him
he
laughed
heartily
without
a
sneer
we
both
seemed
to
feel
better
after
that
i
drank
his
wine
and
smoked
his
cigars
and
he
appeared
to
take
a
certain
grim
pleasure
in
watching
me
there
no
fool
like
a
young
fool
he
observed
presently
as
i
had
no
doubt
he
referred
to
me
i
paid
him
no
attention
after
fidgeting
with
his
shawls
he
gave
me
an
oblique
scowl
and
asked
me
my
age
i
replied
sort
of
a
tadpole
are
you
he
said
as
i
took
no
offence
he
repeated
the
remark
oh
come
said
i
there
no
use
in
trying
to
irritate
me
i
see
through
you
a
row
acts
like
a
cocktail
on
you
but
you
have
to
stick
to
gruel
in
my
company
i
call
that
impudence
he
rasped
out
wrathfully
i
do
care
what
you
call
it
i
replied
undisturbed
i
am
not
going
to
be
worried
by
you
anyway
i
ended
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
could
be
very
good
company
if
you
chose
the
proposition
appeared
to
take
his
breath
away
at
least
he
said
nothing
more
and
i
finished
my
cigar
in
peace
and
tossed
the
stump
into
a
saucer
now
said
i
what
price
do
you
set
upon
your
birds
mr
halyard
ten
thousand
dollars
he
snapped
with
an
evil
smile
you
will
receive
a
certified
check
when
the
birds
are
delivered
i
said
quietly
you
do
mean
to
say
you
agree
to
that
outrageous
bargain
and
i
wo
take
a
cent
less
either
good
lord
have
you
any
spirit
left
he
cried
half
rising
from
his
pile
of
shawls
his
piteous
eagerness
for
a
dispute
sent
me
into
laughter
impossible
to
control
and
he
eyed
me
mouth
open
animosity
rising
visibly
then
he
seized
the
wheels
of
his
invalid
chair
and
trundled
away
too
mad
to
speak
and
i
strolled
out
into
the
parlor
still
laughing
the
pretty
nurse
was
there
sewing
under
a
hanging
lamp
if
i
am
not
indiscreet
i
began
indiscretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
said
she
dropping
her
head
but
raising
her
eyes
so
i
sat
down
with
a
frivolous
smile
peculiar
to
the
appreciated
doubtless
said
i
you
are
hemming
a
doubtless
i
am
not
she
said
this
is
a
for
mr
halyard
a
mental
vision
of
halyard
in
a
very
mad
nearly
set
me
laughing
again
like
the
king
of
yvetot
he
wears
his
crown
in
bed
i
said
flippantly
the
king
of
yvetot
might
have
made
that
remark
she
observed
her
needle
it
is
unpleasant
to
be
reproved
how
large
and
red
and
hot
a
ears
feel
to
cool
them
i
strolled
out
to
the
porch
and
after
a
while
the
pretty
nurse
came
out
too
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
not
far
away
she
probably
regretted
her
lost
opportunity
to
be
flirted
with
i
have
so
little
company
it
is
a
great
relief
to
see
somebody
from
the
world
she
said
if
you
can
be
agreeable
i
wish
you
would
the
idea
that
she
had
come
out
to
see
me
was
so
agreeable
that
i
remained
speechless
until
she
said
do
tell
me
what
people
are
doing
in
new
york
so
i
seated
myself
on
the
steps
and
talked
about
the
portion
of
the
world
inhabited
by
me
while
she
sat
sewing
in
the
dull
light
that
straggled
out
from
the
parlor
windows
she
had
a
certain
coquetry
of
her
own
using
the
usual
methods
with
an
individuality
that
was
certainly
fetching
for
instance
when
she
lost
her
needle
and
another
time
when
we
both
on
hands
and
knees
hunted
for
her
thimble
however
directions
for
these
pastimes
may
be
found
in
contemporary
classics
i
was
as
entertaining
as
i
could
be
perhaps
not
quite
as
entertaining
as
a
young
man
usually
thinks
he
is
however
we
got
on
very
well
together
until
i
asked
her
tenderly
who
the
might
be
whom
they
all
discussed
so
mysteriously
i
do
not
care
to
speak
about
it
she
said
with
a
primness
of
which
i
had
not
suspected
her
capable
of
course
i
could
scarcely
pursue
the
subject
after
that
and
indeed
i
did
not
intend
to
so
i
began
to
tell
her
how
i
fancied
i
had
seen
a
man
on
the
cliff
that
afternoon
and
how
the
creature
slid
over
the
sheer
rock
like
a
snake
to
my
amazement
she
asked
me
to
kindly
discontinue
the
account
of
my
adventures
in
an
icy
tone
which
left
no
room
for
protest
it
was
only
a
i
tried
to
explain
thinking
perhaps
she
did
not
care
for
snake
stories
but
the
explanation
did
not
appear
to
interest
her
and
i
was
mortified
to
observe
that
my
impression
upon
her
was
anything
but
pleasant
she
does
seem
to
like
me
and
my
stories
thought
i
but
she
is
too
young
perhaps
to
appreciate
them
so
i
forgave
her
for
she
was
even
prettier
than
i
had
thought
her
at
first
and
i
took
my
leave
saying
that
halyard
would
doubtless
direct
me
to
my
room
halyard
was
in
his
library
cleaning
a
revolver
when
i
entered
your
room
is
next
to
mine
he
said
pleasant
dreams
and
kindly
refrain
from
snoring
may
i
venture
an
absurd
hope
that
you
will
do
the
same
i
replied
politely
that
maddened
him
so
i
hastily
withdrew
i
had
been
asleep
for
at
least
two
hours
when
a
movement
by
my
bedside
and
a
light
in
my
eyes
awakened
me
i
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
blinking
at
halyard
who
clad
in
a
and
wearing
a
had
wheeled
himself
into
my
room
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
solemnly
waved
a
candle
over
my
head
i
so
cursed
lonely
he
said
come
there
a
good
fellow
talk
to
me
in
your
own
original
impudent
way
i
objected
strenuously
but
he
looked
so
worn
and
thin
so
lonely
and
so
lovelessly
grotesque
that
i
got
out
of
bed
and
passed
a
spongeful
of
cold
water
over
my
head
then
i
returned
to
bed
and
propped
the
pillows
up
for
a
ready
to
quarrel
with
him
if
it
might
bring
some
little
pleasure
into
his
morbid
existence
no
he
said
amiably
i
too
worried
to
quarrel
but
i
much
obliged
for
your
kindly
offer
i
want
to
tell
you
something
what
i
asked
suspiciously
i
want
to
ask
you
if
you
ever
saw
a
man
with
gills
like
a
fish
gills
i
repeated
yes
gills
did
you
no
i
replied
angrily
and
neither
did
you
no
i
never
did
he
said
in
a
curiously
placid
voice
but
a
man
with
gills
like
a
fish
who
lives
in
the
ocean
out
there
oh
you
need
look
that
way
nobody
ever
thinks
of
doubting
my
word
and
i
tell
you
that
there
a
man
or
a
thing
that
looks
like
a
man
as
big
as
you
are
too
all
with
nasty
red
gills
like
a
fish
and
i
a
witness
to
prove
what
i
say
who
i
asked
sarcastically
the
witness
my
nurse
oh
she
saw
a
man
with
gills
yes
she
did
so
did
francis
lee
superintendent
of
the
mica
quarry
company
at
so
have
a
dozen
men
who
work
in
the
quarry
oh
you
need
laugh
young
man
it
an
old
story
here
and
anybody
can
tell
you
about
the
the
i
exclaimed
yes
that
thing
with
gills
that
looks
like
a
man
and
by
heaven
a
man
that
the
ask
any
quarryman
at
what
it
is
that
comes
purring
around
their
boats
at
the
wharf
and
unties
painters
and
changes
the
mooring
of
every
in
the
cove
at
night
ask
francis
lee
what
it
was
he
saw
running
and
leaping
up
and
down
the
shoal
at
sunset
last
friday
ask
anybody
along
the
coast
what
sort
of
a
thing
moves
about
the
cliffs
like
a
man
and
slides
over
them
into
the
sea
like
an
otter
i
saw
it
do
that
i
burst
out
oh
did
you
well
was
it
something
kept
me
silent
although
a
dozen
explanations
flew
to
my
lips
after
a
pause
halyard
said
you
saw
the
that
what
you
saw
i
looked
at
him
without
a
word
do
mistake
me
he
said
pettishly
i
do
think
that
the
is
a
spirit
or
a
sprite
or
a
hobgoblin
or
any
sort
of
damned
rot
neither
do
i
believe
it
to
be
an
optical
illusion
what
do
you
think
it
is
i
asked
i
think
it
a
man
i
think
it
a
branch
of
the
human
race
what
i
think
let
me
tell
you
something
the
deepest
spot
in
the
atlantic
ocean
is
a
trifle
over
five
miles
deep
and
i
suppose
you
know
that
this
place
lies
only
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
this
headland
the
british
exploring
vessel
captain
marotte
discovered
and
sounded
it
i
believe
anyway
it
there
and
it
my
belief
that
the
profound
depths
are
inhabited
by
the
remnants
of
the
last
race
of
amphibious
human
beings
this
was
childish
i
did
not
bother
to
reply
believe
it
or
not
as
you
will
he
said
angrily
one
thing
i
know
and
that
is
this
the
has
taken
to
hanging
around
my
cove
and
he
is
attracted
by
my
nurse
i
wo
have
it
i
blow
his
fishy
gills
out
of
his
head
if
i
ever
get
a
shot
at
him
i
do
care
whether
it
homicide
or
not
anyway
it
a
new
kind
of
murder
and
it
attracts
me
i
gazed
at
him
incredulously
but
he
was
working
himself
into
a
passion
and
i
did
not
choose
to
say
what
i
thought
yes
this
thing
with
gills
goes
purring
and
grinning
and
spitting
about
after
my
nurse
when
she
walks
when
she
rows
when
she
sits
on
the
beach
gad
it
drives
me
nearly
frantic
i
tolerate
it
i
tell
you
no
said
i
i
would
either
and
i
rolled
over
in
bed
convulsed
with
laughter
the
next
moment
i
heard
my
door
slam
i
smothered
my
mirth
and
rose
to
close
the
window
for
the
blew
cold
from
the
forest
and
a
drizzle
was
sweeping
the
carpet
as
far
as
my
bed
that
luminous
glare
which
sometimes
lingers
after
the
stars
go
out
threw
a
trembling
nebulous
radiance
over
sand
and
cove
i
heard
the
seething
currents
under
the
breakers
softened
thunder
louder
than
i
ever
heard
it
then
as
i
closed
my
window
lingering
for
a
last
look
at
the
crawling
tide
i
saw
a
man
standing
in
the
surf
all
alone
there
in
the
night
but
was
it
a
man
for
the
figure
suddenly
began
running
over
the
beach
on
all
fours
like
a
beetle
waving
its
limbs
like
feelers
before
i
could
throw
open
the
window
again
it
darted
into
the
surf
and
when
i
leaned
out
into
the
chilling
drizzle
i
saw
nothing
save
the
flat
ebb
crawling
on
the
coast
i
heard
nothing
save
the
purring
of
bubbles
on
seething
sands
v
it
took
me
a
week
to
perfect
my
arrangements
for
transporting
the
great
auks
by
water
to
where
a
lumber
schooner
was
to
be
sent
from
petite
sainte
isole
chartered
by
me
for
a
voyage
to
new
york
i
had
constructed
a
cage
made
of
osiers
in
which
my
auks
were
to
squat
until
they
arrived
at
bronx
park
my
telegrams
to
professor
farrago
were
brief
one
merely
said
victory
another
explained
that
i
wanted
no
assistance
and
a
third
read
schooner
chartered
arrive
new
york
july
send
to
foot
of
bluff
street
my
week
as
a
guest
of
halyard
proved
interesting
i
wrangled
with
that
invalid
to
his
heart
content
i
worked
all
day
on
my
osier
cage
i
hunted
the
thimble
in
the
moonlight
with
the
pretty
nurse
we
sometimes
found
it
as
for
the
thing
they
called
the
i
saw
it
a
dozen
times
but
always
either
at
night
or
so
far
away
and
so
close
to
the
sea
that
of
course
no
trace
of
it
remained
when
i
reached
the
spot
rifle
in
hand
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
the
was
a
demented
darky
wandered
from
heaven
knows
where
perhaps
shipwrecked
and
gone
mad
from
his
sufferings
still
it
was
far
from
pleasant
to
know
that
the
creature
was
strongly
attracted
by
the
pretty
nurse
she
however
persisted
in
regarding
the
as
a
she
earnestly
affirmed
that
it
had
gills
like
a
gills
that
it
had
a
soft
fleshy
hole
for
a
mouth
and
its
eyes
were
luminous
and
lidless
and
fixed
besides
she
said
with
a
shudder
it
all
slate
color
like
a
porpoise
and
it
looks
as
wet
as
a
sheet
of
in
a
the
day
before
i
was
to
set
sail
with
my
auks
in
a
bound
for
halyard
trundled
up
to
me
in
his
chair
and
announced
his
intention
of
going
with
me
going
where
i
asked
to
and
then
to
new
york
he
replied
tranquilly
i
was
doubtful
and
my
lack
of
cordiality
hurt
his
feelings
oh
of
course
if
you
need
the
i
began
i
do
i
need
you
he
said
savagely
i
need
the
stimulus
of
our
daily
quarrel
i
never
disagreed
so
pleasantly
with
anybody
in
my
life
it
agrees
with
me
i
am
a
hundred
per
cent
better
than
i
was
last
week
i
was
inclined
to
resent
this
but
something
in
the
face
of
the
invalid
softened
me
besides
i
had
taken
a
hearty
liking
to
the
old
pig
i
do
want
any
mawkish
sentiment
about
it
he
said
observing
me
closely
i
wo
permit
anybody
to
feel
sorry
for
me
do
you
understand
i
trouble
you
to
use
a
different
tone
in
addressing
me
i
replied
hotly
i
feel
sorry
for
you
if
i
choose
to
and
our
usual
quarrel
proceeded
to
his
deep
satisfaction
by
six
next
evening
i
had
halyard
luggage
stowed
away
in
the
and
the
pretty
nurse
effects
corded
down
with
the
newly
hatched
in
a
on
top
she
and
i
placed
the
osier
cage
aboard
securing
it
firmly
and
then
throwing
tablecloths
over
the
auks
heads
we
led
those
simple
and
dignified
birds
down
the
path
and
across
the
plank
at
the
little
wooden
pier
together
we
locked
up
the
house
while
halyard
stormed
at
us
both
and
wheeled
himself
furiously
up
and
down
the
beach
below
at
the
last
moment
she
forgot
her
thimble
but
we
found
it
i
forget
where
come
on
shouted
halyard
waving
his
shawls
furiously
what
the
devil
are
you
about
up
there
he
received
our
explanation
with
a
sniff
and
we
trundled
him
aboard
without
further
ceremony
do
run
me
across
the
plank
like
a
steamer
trunk
he
shouted
as
i
shot
him
dexterously
into
the
but
the
wind
was
dying
away
and
i
had
no
time
to
dispute
with
him
then
the
sun
was
setting
above
the
ridge
as
our
sail
flapped
and
partly
filled
and
i
cast
off
and
began
a
long
tack
east
by
south
to
avoid
the
spouting
rocks
on
our
starboard
bow
the
rose
in
clouds
as
we
swung
across
the
shoal
the
black
scuttered
out
to
sea
the
gulls
tossed
their
wings
in
the
ocean
riding
the
rollers
like
bits
of
froth
already
we
were
sailing
slowly
out
across
that
great
hole
in
the
ocean
five
miles
deep
the
most
profound
sounding
ever
taken
in
the
atlantic
the
presence
of
great
heights
or
great
depths
seen
or
unseen
always
impresses
the
human
mind
perhaps
oppresses
it
we
were
very
silent
the
sunlight
stain
on
cliff
and
beach
deepened
to
crimson
then
faded
into
sombre
purple
bloom
that
lingered
long
after
the
died
out
in
the
zenith
our
progress
was
slow
at
times
although
the
sail
filled
with
the
rising
land
breeze
we
scarcely
seemed
to
move
at
all
of
course
said
the
pretty
nurse
we
could
be
aground
in
the
deepest
hole
in
the
atlantic
scarcely
said
halyard
sarcastically
unless
we
grounded
on
a
whale
what
that
soft
thumping
i
asked
have
we
run
afoul
of
a
barrel
or
log
it
was
almost
too
dark
to
see
but
i
leaned
over
the
rail
and
swept
the
water
with
my
hand
instantly
something
smooth
glided
under
it
like
the
back
of
a
great
fish
and
i
jerked
my
hand
back
to
the
tiller
at
the
same
moment
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
seemed
to
begin
to
purr
with
a
sound
like
the
breaking
of
froth
in
a
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
halyard
sharply
a
fish
came
up
under
my
hand
i
said
a
porpoise
or
something
with
a
low
cry
the
pretty
nurse
clasped
my
arm
in
both
her
hands
listen
she
whispered
it
purring
around
the
boat
what
the
devil
purring
shouted
halyard
i
wo
have
anything
purring
around
me
at
that
moment
to
my
amazement
i
saw
that
the
boat
had
stopped
entirely
although
the
sail
was
full
and
the
small
pennant
fluttered
from
the
something
too
was
tugging
at
the
rudder
twisting
and
jerking
it
until
the
tiller
strained
and
creaked
in
my
hand
all
at
once
it
snapped
the
tiller
swung
useless
and
the
boat
whirled
around
heeling
in
the
stiffening
wind
and
drove
shoreward
it
was
then
that
i
ducking
to
escape
the
boom
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
ahead
something
that
a
sudden
wave
seemed
to
toss
on
deck
and
leave
there
wet
and
flapping
a
man
with
round
fixed
fishy
eyes
and
soft
slaty
skin
but
the
horror
of
the
thing
were
the
two
gills
that
swelled
and
relaxed
spasmodically
emitting
a
rasping
purring
sound
two
gasping
gills
all
fluted
and
scolloped
and
distended
frozen
with
amazement
and
repugnance
i
stared
at
the
creature
i
felt
the
hair
stirring
on
my
head
and
the
icy
sweat
on
my
forehead
it
the
screamed
halyard
the
had
gathered
himself
into
a
wet
lump
squatting
motionless
in
the
bows
under
the
mast
his
lidless
eyes
were
phosphorescent
like
the
eyes
of
living
codfish
after
a
while
i
felt
that
either
fright
or
disgust
was
going
to
strangle
me
where
i
sat
but
it
was
only
the
arms
of
the
pretty
nurse
clasped
around
me
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
there
was
not
a
aboard
that
we
could
get
at
halyard
hand
crept
backward
where
a
lay
and
i
also
made
a
clutch
at
it
the
next
moment
i
had
it
in
my
hand
and
staggered
forward
but
the
boat
was
already
tumbling
shoreward
among
the
breakers
and
the
next
i
knew
the
ran
at
me
like
a
colossal
rat
just
as
the
boat
rolled
over
and
over
through
the
surf
spilling
freight
and
passengers
among
the
rocks
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
thrashing
about
in
a
rocky
pool
blinded
by
the
water
and
half
suffocated
while
under
my
feet
like
a
stranded
porpoise
the
made
the
water
boil
in
his
efforts
to
upset
me
but
his
limbs
seemed
soft
and
boneless
he
had
no
nails
no
teeth
and
he
bounced
and
thumped
and
flapped
and
splashed
like
a
fish
while
i
rained
blows
on
him
with
the
that
sounded
like
blows
on
a
football
and
all
the
while
his
gills
were
blowing
out
and
frothing
and
purring
and
his
lidless
eyes
looked
into
mine
until
nauseated
and
trembling
i
dragged
myself
back
to
the
beach
where
already
the
pretty
nurse
alternately
wrung
her
hands
and
her
petticoats
in
ornamental
despair
beyond
the
cove
halyard
was
bobbing
up
and
down
afloat
in
his
invalid
chair
trying
to
steer
shoreward
he
was
the
maddest
man
i
ever
saw
have
you
killed
that
thing
yet
he
roared
i
ca
kill
it
i
shouted
breathlessly
i
might
as
well
try
to
kill
a
football
ca
you
punch
a
hole
in
it
he
bawled
if
i
can
only
get
at
him
his
words
were
drowned
in
a
thunderous
splashing
a
roar
of
great
broad
flippers
beating
the
sea
and
i
saw
the
gigantic
forms
of
my
two
great
auks
followed
by
their
chicks
blundering
past
in
a
shower
of
spray
driving
headlong
out
into
the
ocean
oh
lord
i
said
i
ca
stand
that
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
fainted
peacefully
and
appropriately
at
the
feet
of
the
pretty
nurse
it
is
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
this
story
may
be
doubted
it
does
matter
nothing
can
add
to
the
despair
of
a
man
who
has
lost
two
great
auks
as
for
halyard
nothing
affects
him
except
his
involuntary
and
that
did
him
so
much
good
that
he
writes
me
from
the
south
that
he
going
on
a
through
switzerland
if
i
join
him
i
might
have
joined
him
if
he
had
not
married
the
pretty
nurse
i
wonder
whether
but
of
course
this
is
no
place
for
speculation
in
regard
to
the
you
may
believe
it
or
not
as
you
choose
but
if
you
hear
of
any
great
auks
being
found
kindly
throw
a
over
their
heads
and
notify
the
authorities
at
the
new
zoological
gardens
in
bronx
park
new
york
the
reward
is
ten
thousand
dollars
vi
before
i
proceed
any
further
common
decency
requires
me
to
reassure
my
readers
concerning
my
intentions
which
heaven
knows
are
far
from
flippant
to
separate
fact
from
fancy
has
always
been
difficult
for
me
but
now
that
i
have
had
the
honor
to
be
chosen
secretary
of
the
zoological
gardens
in
bronx
park
i
realize
keenly
that
unless
i
give
up
writing
fiction
nobody
will
believe
what
i
write
about
science
therefore
it
is
to
a
serious
and
unimaginative
public
that
i
shall
hereafter
address
myself
and
i
do
it
in
the
modest
confidence
that
i
shall
neither
be
distrusted
nor
doubted
although
unfortunately
i
still
write
in
that
irrational
style
which
suggests
covert
frivolity
and
for
which
i
am
undergoing
a
course
of
treatment
in
english
literature
at
columbia
college
now
having
promised
to
avoid
originality
and
confine
myself
to
facts
i
shall
tell
what
i
have
to
tell
concerning
the
dingue
the
mammoth
and
something
else
for
some
weeks
it
had
been
rumored
that
professor
farrago
president
of
the
bronx
park
zoological
society
would
resign
to
accept
an
enormous
salary
as
manager
of
barnum
bailey
circus
he
was
now
with
the
circus
in
london
and
had
promised
to
cable
his
decision
before
the
day
was
over
i
hoped
he
would
decide
to
remain
with
us
i
was
his
secretary
and
particular
favorite
and
i
viewed
without
enthusiasm
the
advent
of
a
new
president
who
might
shake
us
all
out
of
our
congenial
and
carefully
excavated
ruts
however
it
was
plain
that
the
trustees
of
the
society
expected
the
resignation
of
professor
farrago
for
they
had
been
in
secret
session
all
day
considering
the
names
of
possible
candidates
to
fill
professor
farrago
large
shoes
these
preparations
worried
me
for
i
could
scarcely
expect
another
chief
as
kind
and
considerate
as
professor
leonidas
farrago
that
afternoon
in
june
i
left
my
office
in
the
administration
building
in
bronx
park
and
strolled
out
under
the
trees
for
a
breath
of
air
but
the
heat
of
the
sun
soon
drove
me
to
seek
shelter
under
a
little
square
arbor
a
shady
retreat
covered
with
purple
wistaria
and
honeysuckle
as
i
entered
the
arbor
i
noticed
that
there
were
three
other
people
seated
there
an
elderly
lady
with
masculine
features
and
short
hair
a
younger
lady
sitting
beside
her
and
farther
away
a
young
man
reading
a
book
for
a
moment
i
had
an
indistinct
impression
of
having
met
the
elder
lady
somewhere
and
under
circumstances
not
entirely
agreeable
but
beyond
a
stony
and
indifferent
glance
she
paid
no
attention
to
me
as
for
the
younger
lady
she
did
not
look
at
me
at
all
she
was
very
young
with
pretty
eyes
a
mass
of
silky
brown
hair
and
a
skin
as
fresh
as
a
rose
which
had
just
been
rained
on
with
that
delicacy
peculiar
to
lonely
scientific
bachelors
i
modestly
sat
down
beside
the
rough
young
man
although
there
was
more
room
beside
the
younger
lady
some
lazy
loafer
reading
a
penny
dreadful
i
thought
glancing
at
him
then
at
the
title
of
his
book
hearing
me
beside
him
he
turned
around
and
blinked
over
his
shabby
shoulder
and
the
movement
uncovered
the
page
he
had
been
silently
conning
the
volume
in
his
hands
was
darwin
famous
monograph
on
the
monodactyl
he
noticed
the
astonishment
on
my
face
and
smiled
uneasily
shifting
the
short
clay
pipe
in
his
mouth
i
guess
he
observed
that
this
here
book
is
too
much
for
me
mister
it
rather
technical
i
replied
smiling
yes
he
said
in
vague
admiration
it
fierce
ai
it
after
a
silence
i
asked
him
if
he
would
tell
me
why
he
had
chosen
darwin
as
a
literary
pastime
well
he
said
placidly
i
was
tryin
to
read
about
annermals
but
i
up
against
a
this
time
all
right
now
here
a
and
he
painfully
spelled
out
breathing
hard
all
the
while
monodactyl
i
said
means
a
creature
he
turned
the
page
with
alacrity
is
that
the
beast
he
about
he
asked
the
illustration
he
pointed
out
was
a
representing
reconstruction
of
the
dingue
from
the
fossil
bones
in
the
british
museum
it
was
a
showing
a
dingue
in
the
foreground
and
to
give
scale
a
mammoth
in
the
middle
distance
yes
i
replied
that
is
the
dingue
i
seen
one
he
observed
calmly
i
smiled
and
explained
that
the
dingue
had
been
extinct
for
some
thousands
of
years
oh
i
guess
not
he
replied
with
cool
optimism
then
he
placed
a
grimy
forefinger
on
the
mammoth
i
seen
them
things
too
he
remarked
again
i
patiently
pointed
out
his
error
and
suggested
that
he
referred
to
the
elephant
elephant
be
blowed
he
replied
scornfully
i
guess
i
know
what
i
seen
an
i
seen
that
there
thing
you
call
a
dingue
too
not
wishing
to
prolong
a
futile
discussion
i
remained
silent
after
a
moment
he
wheeled
around
removing
his
pipe
from
his
hard
mouth
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
graham
glacier
he
demanded
certainly
i
replied
astonished
it
the
southernmost
glacier
in
british
america
right
he
said
and
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
the
hudson
mountings
mister
yes
i
replied
what
behind
he
snapped
out
nobody
knows
i
answered
they
are
considered
impassable
they
ai
though
he
said
doggedly
i
been
behind
really
i
replied
tiring
of
his
yarn
reely
he
repeated
sullenly
then
he
began
to
fumble
and
search
through
the
pages
of
his
book
until
he
found
what
he
wanted
mister
he
said
jest
read
that
out
loud
please
the
passage
he
indicated
was
the
famous
chapter
beginning
is
the
mammoth
extinct
is
the
dingue
extinct
probably
and
yet
the
aborigines
of
british
america
maintain
the
contrary
probably
both
the
mammoth
and
the
dingue
are
extinct
but
until
expeditions
have
penetrated
and
explored
not
only
the
unknown
region
in
alaska
but
also
that
hidden
beyond
the
graham
glacier
and
the
hudson
mountains
it
will
not
be
possible
to
definitely
announce
the
total
extinction
of
either
the
mammoth
or
the
dingue
when
i
had
read
it
slowly
for
his
benefit
he
brought
his
hand
down
smartly
on
one
knee
and
nodded
rapidly
mister
he
said
that
gent
knows
a
thing
or
two
and
do
you
forgit
it
then
he
demanded
abruptly
how
i
knew
he
had
been
behind
the
graham
glacier
i
explained
shucks
he
said
there
a
road
five
miles
wide
inter
that
there
mister
i
ai
been
in
new
york
long
i
come
inter
port
a
week
ago
on
the
whaler
i
was
in
the
hudson
range
when
that
there
graham
glacier
bust
up
what
i
exclaimed
did
you
know
it
he
asked
well
mebbe
it
ai
in
the
papers
but
it
busted
all
right
blowed
up
by
a
earthquake
an
volcano
combine
an
mister
it
was
oreful
my
how
i
did
run
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
some
convulsion
of
the
earth
has
shattered
the
graham
glacier
i
asked
convulsions
an
fits
too
he
said
sulkily
the
hull
blame
thing
dropped
inter
a
hole
an
say
mister
home
an
mother
is
good
enough
fur
me
now
i
stared
at
him
stupidly
once
he
said
i
ketched
pelts
fur
them
sharps
at
hudson
bay
like
any
yaller
husky
but
the
things
i
seen
arter
that
the
i
seen
behind
the
hudson
do
make
me
hanker
arter
no
life
on
the
wild
lem
me
tell
yer
i
may
be
a
mother
carey
chicken
but
this
chicken
has
got
enough
after
a
long
silence
i
picked
up
his
book
again
and
pointed
at
the
picture
of
the
mammoth
what
color
is
it
i
asked
kinder
red
an
brown
he
answered
promptly
it
woolly
too
astounded
i
pointed
to
the
dingue
he
said
quickly
makes
a
noise
like
a
bell
when
scutterin
about
intensely
excited
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
my
society
will
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
i
said
if
you
pilot
me
inside
the
hudson
and
show
me
either
a
mammoth
or
a
dingue
he
looked
me
calmly
in
the
eye
mister
he
said
slowly
have
you
got
a
million
for
to
squander
on
me
no
i
said
suspiciously
because
he
went
on
it
would
be
enough
home
an
mother
suits
me
now
he
picked
up
his
book
and
rose
in
vain
i
asked
his
name
and
address
in
vain
i
begged
him
to
dine
with
me
to
become
my
honored
guest
nit
he
said
shortly
and
shambled
off
down
the
path
but
i
was
not
going
to
lose
him
like
that
i
rose
and
deliberately
started
to
stalk
him
it
was
easy
he
shuffled
along
pulling
on
his
pipe
and
i
after
him
it
was
growing
a
little
dark
although
the
sun
still
reddened
the
tops
of
the
maples
afraid
of
losing
him
in
the
falling
dusk
i
once
more
approached
him
and
laid
my
hand
upon
his
ragged
sleeve
look
here
he
cried
wheeling
about
i
want
you
to
quit
me
do
i
tell
you
money
ca
make
me
go
back
to
them
mountings
and
as
i
attempted
to
speak
he
suddenly
tore
off
his
cap
and
pointed
to
his
head
his
hair
was
white
as
snow
that
what
come
of
monkeyin
inter
your
cursed
mountings
he
shouted
fiercely
there
things
in
there
what
no
christian
oughter
see
lem
me
alone
er
i
bust
yer
he
shambled
on
doubled
fists
swinging
by
his
side
the
next
moment
setting
my
teeth
obstinately
i
followed
him
and
caught
him
by
the
park
gate
at
my
hail
he
whirled
around
with
a
snarl
but
i
grabbed
him
by
the
throat
and
backed
him
violently
against
the
park
wall
you
invaluable
ruffian
i
said
now
you
listen
to
me
i
live
in
that
big
stone
building
and
i
give
you
a
thousand
dollars
to
take
me
behind
the
graham
glacier
think
it
over
and
call
on
me
when
you
are
in
a
pleasanter
frame
of
mind
if
you
do
come
by
noon
i
go
to
the
graham
glacier
without
you
he
was
attempting
to
kick
me
all
the
time
but
i
managed
to
avoid
him
and
when
i
had
finished
i
gave
him
a
shove
which
almost
loosened
his
spinal
column
he
went
reeling
out
across
the
sidewalk
and
when
he
had
recovered
his
breath
and
his
balance
he
danced
with
displeasure
and
displayed
a
vocabulary
that
astonished
me
however
he
kept
his
distance
as
i
turned
back
into
the
park
satisfied
that
he
would
not
follow
the
first
person
i
saw
was
the
elderly
lady
of
the
wistaria
arbor
advancing
on
tiptoe
behind
her
came
the
younger
lady
with
cheeks
like
a
rose
that
had
been
rained
on
instantly
it
occurred
to
me
that
they
had
followed
us
and
at
the
same
moment
i
knew
who
the
lady
was
angry
but
polite
i
lifted
my
hat
and
saluted
her
and
she
probably
furious
at
having
been
caught
after
me
cut
me
dead
the
younger
lady
passed
me
with
face
averted
but
even
in
the
dusk
i
could
see
the
tip
of
one
little
ear
turn
scarlet
walking
on
hurriedly
i
entered
the
administration
building
and
found
professor
lesard
of
the
reptilian
department
preparing
to
leave
do
you
do
it
i
said
sharply
i
got
exciting
news
i
only
going
to
the
theatre
he
replied
it
a
good
show
adam
and
eve
there
a
snake
in
it
you
know
it
in
my
line
i
ca
help
it
i
said
and
i
told
him
briefly
what
had
occurred
in
the
arbor
but
that
not
all
i
continued
savagely
those
women
followed
us
and
who
do
you
think
one
of
them
turned
out
to
be
well
it
was
professor
smawl
of
barnard
college
and
i
bet
every
pair
of
boots
i
own
that
she
starts
for
the
graham
glacier
within
a
week
idiot
that
i
was
i
exclaimed
smiting
my
head
with
both
hands
i
never
recognized
her
until
i
saw
her
and
craning
her
neck
to
listen
now
she
knows
about
the
glacier
she
heard
every
word
that
young
ruffian
said
and
she
go
to
the
glacier
if
it
only
to
forestall
me
professor
lesard
looked
anxious
he
knew
that
miss
smawl
professor
of
natural
history
at
barnard
college
had
long
desired
an
appointment
at
the
bronx
park
gardens
it
was
even
said
she
had
a
chance
of
succeeding
professor
farrago
as
president
but
that
of
course
must
have
been
a
joke
however
she
haunted
the
gardens
annoying
the
keepers
by
persistently
poking
the
animals
with
her
umbrella
on
one
occasion
she
sent
us
word
that
she
desired
to
enter
the
enclosure
for
the
purpose
of
making
experiments
in
hypnotism
professor
farrago
was
absent
but
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
send
back
word
that
i
feared
the
tigers
might
injure
her
the
miserable
small
boy
who
took
my
message
informed
her
that
i
was
afraid
she
might
injure
the
tigers
and
the
unpleasant
incident
almost
cost
me
my
position
i
am
quite
convinced
said
i
to
professor
lesard
that
miss
smawl
is
perfectly
capable
of
abusing
the
information
she
overheard
and
of
starting
herself
to
explore
a
region
that
by
all
the
laws
of
decency
justice
and
prior
claim
belongs
to
me
well
said
lesard
with
a
peculiar
laugh
it
not
certain
whether
you
can
go
at
all
professor
farrago
will
authorize
me
i
said
confidently
professor
farrago
has
resigned
said
lesard
it
was
a
bolt
from
a
clear
sky
good
heavens
i
blurted
out
what
will
become
of
the
rest
of
us
then
i
do
know
he
replied
the
trustees
are
holding
a
meeting
over
in
the
administration
building
to
elect
a
new
president
for
us
it
depends
on
the
new
president
what
becomes
of
us
lesard
i
said
hoarsely
you
do
suppose
that
they
could
possibly
elect
miss
smawl
as
our
president
do
you
he
looked
at
me
askance
and
bit
his
cigar
i
be
in
a
nice
position
would
i
said
i
anxiously
the
lady
would
probably
make
you
walk
the
plank
for
that
tiger
business
he
replied
but
i
did
do
it
i
protested
with
sickly
eagerness
besides
i
explained
to
her
he
said
nothing
and
i
stared
at
him
appalled
by
the
possibility
of
reporting
to
professor
smawl
for
instructions
next
morning
see
here
lesard
i
said
nervously
i
wish
you
would
step
over
to
the
administration
building
and
ask
the
trustees
if
i
may
prepare
for
this
expedition
will
you
he
glanced
at
me
sympathetically
it
was
quite
natural
for
me
to
wish
to
secure
my
position
before
the
new
president
was
elected
especially
as
there
was
a
chance
of
the
new
president
being
miss
smawl
you
are
quite
right
he
said
the
graham
glacier
would
be
the
safest
place
for
you
if
our
next
president
is
to
be
the
lady
of
the
tigers
and
he
started
across
the
park
puffing
his
cigar
i
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
to
wait
for
his
return
not
at
all
charmed
with
the
prospect
it
made
me
furious
too
to
see
my
ambition
nipped
with
the
frost
of
a
possible
veto
from
miss
smawl
if
she
is
elected
thought
i
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
to
resign
to
avoid
the
inconvenience
of
being
shown
the
door
oh
i
wish
i
had
allowed
her
to
hypnotize
the
tigers
thoughts
of
crime
flitted
through
my
mind
miss
smawl
would
not
remain
president
or
anything
else
very
long
if
she
persisted
in
her
desire
for
the
tigers
and
then
when
she
called
for
help
i
would
pretend
not
to
hear
aroused
from
criminal
meditation
by
the
return
of
professor
lesard
i
jumped
up
and
peered
into
his
perplexed
eyes
they
elected
a
president
he
said
but
they
wo
tell
us
who
the
president
is
until
you
do
think
i
stammered
i
do
know
but
i
know
this
the
new
president
sanctions
the
expedition
to
the
graham
glacier
and
directs
you
to
choose
an
assistant
and
begin
preparations
for
four
people
overjoyed
i
seized
his
hand
and
said
hurray
in
a
voice
weak
with
emotion
the
old
dragon
is
elected
this
time
i
added
triumphantly
he
said
who
was
the
other
dragon
with
her
in
the
park
this
evening
i
described
her
in
a
more
modulated
voice
whew
observed
professor
lesard
that
must
be
her
assistant
professor
dorothy
van
twiller
she
the
prettiest
in
town
with
this
curious
remark
my
confrère
followed
me
into
my
room
and
wrote
down
the
list
of
articles
i
dictated
to
him
the
list
included
a
complete
camping
equipment
for
myself
and
three
other
men
am
i
one
of
those
other
men
inquired
lesard
with
an
unhappy
smile
before
i
could
reply
my
door
was
shoved
open
and
a
figure
appeared
at
the
threshold
cap
in
hand
what
do
you
want
i
asked
sternly
but
my
heart
was
beating
high
with
triumph
the
figure
shuffled
then
came
a
subdued
voice
mister
i
guess
i
go
back
to
the
graham
glacier
along
with
you
i
billy
spike
an
it
kinder
scares
me
to
go
back
to
them
hudson
mountains
but
somehow
mister
when
you
choked
me
and
kinder
walked
me
off
on
my
ear
why
mister
i
kinder
took
to
you
like
there
was
absolute
silence
for
a
minute
then
he
said
so
if
you
go
i
guess
i
go
too
mister
for
a
thousand
dollars
fur
nawthin
he
muttered
or
what
you
like
all
right
billy
i
said
briskly
just
look
over
those
rifles
and
ammunition
and
see
that
everything
sound
he
slowly
lifted
his
tough
young
face
and
gave
me
a
doglike
glance
they
were
hard
eyes
but
there
was
gratitude
in
them
you
get
your
throat
slit
whispered
lesard
not
while
billy
with
me
i
replied
cheerfully
late
that
night
as
i
was
preparing
for
pleasant
dreams
a
knock
came
on
my
door
and
a
handed
me
a
note
which
i
read
shivering
in
my
bare
feet
although
the
thermometer
marked
eighty
fahrenheit
you
will
immediately
leave
for
the
hudson
mountains
via
wellman
bay
labrador
there
to
await
further
instructions
equipment
for
yourself
and
one
assistant
will
include
following
articles
here
began
a
list
of
camping
utensils
scientific
paraphernalia
and
provisions
the
steamer
sails
at
five
morning
kindly
find
yourself
on
board
at
that
hour
any
excuse
for
not
complying
with
these
orders
will
be
accepted
as
your
resignation
susan
smawl
president
bronx
zoological
society
lesard
i
shouted
trembling
with
fury
he
appeared
at
his
door
chastely
draped
in
pajamas
and
he
read
the
insolent
letter
with
terrified
alacrity
what
are
you
going
to
do
resign
he
asked
much
frightened
do
i
snarled
grinding
my
teeth
i
going
that
what
i
going
to
do
but
but
you
ca
get
ready
and
catch
that
steamer
too
he
stammered
he
did
not
know
me
vii
and
so
it
came
about
that
one
calm
evening
towards
the
end
of
june
william
spike
and
i
went
into
camp
under
the
southerly
shelter
of
that
vast
granite
wall
called
the
hudson
mountains
there
to
await
the
promised
further
instructions
it
had
been
a
tiresome
trip
by
steamer
to
anticosti
from
there
by
schooner
to
widgeon
bay
then
down
the
coast
and
up
the
cape
clear
river
to
port
porpoise
there
we
bought
three
and
started
due
north
on
the
great
fur
trail
the
second
day
out
we
passed
fort
boisé
the
last
outpost
of
civilization
and
on
the
sixth
day
we
were
travelling
eastward
under
the
granite
mountain
parapets
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
day
out
from
fort
boisé
we
went
into
camp
for
the
last
time
before
entering
the
unknown
land
i
could
see
it
already
through
my
and
while
william
was
building
the
fire
i
climbed
up
among
the
rocks
above
and
sat
down
glasses
levelled
to
study
the
prospect
there
was
nothing
either
extraordinary
or
forbidding
in
the
landscape
which
stretched
out
beyond
to
the
right
the
solid
palisade
of
granite
cut
off
the
view
to
the
left
the
palisade
continued
an
endless
barrier
of
sheer
cliffs
crowned
with
pine
and
hemlock
but
the
interesting
section
of
the
landscape
lay
almost
directly
in
front
of
me
a
rent
in
the
through
which
appeared
to
run
a
level
arid
plain
miles
wide
and
as
smooth
and
even
as
a
highroad
there
could
be
no
doubt
concerning
the
significance
of
that
rent
in
the
solid
and
moreover
it
was
exactly
as
william
spike
had
described
it
however
i
called
to
him
and
he
came
up
from
the
smoky
axe
on
shoulder
yep
he
said
squatting
beside
me
the
graham
glacier
used
to
meander
through
that
there
hole
but
somethin
went
wrong
with
the
earth
an
there
was
a
and
you
saw
it
william
i
said
with
a
sigh
of
envy
hey
seen
it
sure
i
seen
it
i
was
to
spoutin
springs
twenty
mile
west
with
a
bale
o
blue
fox
an
otter
pelt
fust
i
knew
them
geysers
begun
for
to
groan
egregious
like
an
i
seen
the
caribou
south
climate
sez
i
too
bracin
for
me
so
i
struck
a
back
trail
an
landed
onto
a
hill
then
them
geysers
blowed
up
one
arter
the
next
an
i
heard
somethin
kinder
cave
in
between
here
an
china
i
disremember
things
what
happened
somethin
throwed
me
down
but
i
could
stay
there
for
the
blamed
ground
was
like
a
river
all
an
the
sky
hit
me
on
the
back
o
me
head
and
then
i
urged
in
that
new
excitement
which
every
repetition
of
the
story
revived
i
had
heard
it
all
twenty
times
since
we
left
new
york
but
mere
repetition
could
not
apparently
satisfy
me
then
continued
william
the
whole
world
kinder
went
off
like
a
an
i
come
too
an
ran
like
i
know
said
i
cutting
him
short
for
i
had
become
wearied
of
the
invariable
profanity
which
lent
a
lurid
ending
to
his
narrative
after
that
i
continued
you
went
through
the
rent
in
the
mountains
sure
and
you
saw
a
dingue
and
a
creature
that
resembled
a
mammoth
sure
he
repeated
sulkily
and
you
saw
something
else
i
always
asked
this
question
it
fascinated
me
to
see
the
sullen
fright
flicker
in
william
eyes
and
the
mechanical
backward
glance
as
though
what
he
had
seen
might
still
be
behind
him
he
had
never
answered
this
third
question
but
once
and
that
time
he
fairly
snarled
in
my
face
as
he
growled
i
seen
what
no
christian
oughter
see
so
when
i
repeated
and
you
saw
something
else
william
he
gave
me
a
wicked
frightened
leer
and
shuffled
off
to
feed
the
mules
flattery
entreaties
threats
left
him
unmoved
he
never
told
me
what
the
third
thing
was
that
he
had
seen
behind
the
hudson
mountains
william
had
retired
to
mix
up
with
his
mules
i
resumed
my
binoculars
and
my
silent
inspection
of
the
great
smooth
path
left
by
the
graham
glacier
when
something
or
other
exploded
that
vast
mass
of
ice
into
vapor
the
arid
plain
wound
out
from
the
unknown
country
like
a
river
and
i
thought
then
and
think
now
that
when
the
glacier
was
blown
into
vapor
the
vapor
descended
in
the
most
terrific
rain
the
world
has
ever
seen
and
poured
through
the
newly
blasted
sweeping
the
earth
to
to
corroborate
this
theory
miles
to
the
southward
i
could
see
the
débris
winding
out
across
the
land
towards
wellman
bay
but
as
the
terminal
moraine
of
the
vanished
glacier
formerly
ended
there
i
could
not
be
certain
that
my
theory
was
correct
owing
to
the
formation
of
the
mountains
i
could
not
see
more
than
half
a
mile
into
the
unknown
country
what
i
could
see
appeared
to
be
nothing
but
the
continuation
of
the
glacier
path
scored
out
by
the
and
swept
as
smooth
as
a
floor
sitting
there
my
heart
beating
heavily
with
excitement
i
looked
through
the
evening
glow
at
the
endless
with
its
giant
gateway
pierced
for
me
and
i
thought
of
all
the
explorers
and
the
unknown
heroes
trappers
indians
humble
naturalists
perhaps
who
had
attempted
to
scale
that
sheer
barricade
and
had
died
there
or
failed
beaten
back
from
those
eternal
cliffs
eternal
no
for
the
eternal
himself
had
struck
the
rock
and
it
had
sprung
asunder
thundering
obedience
in
the
still
evening
air
the
smoke
from
the
fire
below
mounted
in
a
straight
slender
pillar
like
the
smoke
from
those
ancient
altars
builded
before
the
first
blood
had
been
shed
on
earth
the
evening
wind
stirred
the
pines
a
tiny
spring
brook
made
thin
harmony
among
the
rocks
a
murmur
came
from
the
quiet
camp
it
was
william
adjuring
his
mules
in
the
deepening
twilight
i
descended
the
hillock
stepping
cautiously
among
the
rocks
then
suddenly
as
i
stood
outside
the
reddening
ring
of
firelight
far
in
the
depths
of
the
unknown
country
far
behind
the
a
sound
grew
on
the
quiet
air
william
heard
it
and
turned
his
face
to
the
mountains
the
sound
faded
to
a
vibration
which
was
felt
not
heard
then
once
more
i
began
to
divine
a
vibration
in
the
air
gathering
in
distant
volume
until
it
became
a
sound
lasting
the
space
of
a
spoken
word
fading
to
vibration
then
silence
was
it
a
cry
i
looked
at
william
inquiringly
he
had
quietly
fainted
away
i
got
him
to
the
little
brook
and
poked
his
head
into
the
icy
water
and
after
a
while
he
sat
up
pluckily
to
an
indignant
question
he
replied
naw
i
ai
you
lem
me
be
or
i
have
fits
was
it
that
sound
that
scared
you
i
asked
he
replied
with
a
dauntless
shiver
was
it
the
voice
of
the
mammoth
i
persisted
excitedly
speak
william
or
i
drag
you
about
and
kick
you
he
replied
that
it
was
neither
a
mammoth
nor
a
dingue
and
added
a
strong
request
for
privacy
which
i
was
obliged
to
grant
as
i
could
not
torture
another
word
out
of
him
i
slept
little
that
night
the
exciting
proximity
of
the
unknown
land
was
too
much
for
me
but
although
i
lay
awake
for
hours
i
heard
nothing
except
the
tinkle
of
water
among
the
rocks
and
the
plover
calling
from
some
hidden
marsh
at
daybreak
i
shot
a
ptarmigan
which
had
walked
into
camp
and
the
shot
set
the
echoes
yelling
among
the
mountains
william
sullen
and
dressed
the
bird
and
we
broiled
it
for
breakfast
neither
he
nor
i
alluded
to
the
sound
we
had
heard
the
night
before
he
boiled
water
and
cleaned
up
the
and
i
pottered
about
among
the
rocks
for
another
ptarmigan
wearying
of
this
presently
i
returned
to
the
mules
and
william
and
sat
down
for
a
smoke
it
strikes
me
i
said
that
our
instructions
to
further
orders
are
idiotic
how
are
we
to
receive
orders
here
william
did
not
know
you
do
suppose
said
i
in
sudden
disgust
that
miss
smawl
believes
there
is
a
summer
hotel
and
daily
mail
service
in
the
hudson
mountains
william
thought
perhaps
she
did
suppose
something
of
the
sort
it
irritated
me
beyond
measure
to
find
myself
at
last
on
the
very
border
of
the
unknown
country
and
yet
checked
held
back
by
the
irresponsible
orders
of
a
maiden
lady
named
smawl
however
my
salary
depended
upon
the
whim
of
that
maiden
lady
and
although
i
fussed
and
fumed
and
glared
at
the
mountains
through
my
glasses
i
realized
that
i
could
not
stir
without
the
permission
of
miss
smawl
at
times
this
grotesque
situation
became
almost
unbearable
and
i
often
went
away
by
myself
and
indulged
in
fantasies
firing
my
gun
off
and
pretending
i
had
hit
miss
smawl
by
mistake
at
such
moments
i
would
imagine
i
was
free
at
last
to
plunge
into
the
strange
country
and
i
would
squat
on
a
rock
and
dream
of
bagging
my
first
mammoth
the
time
passed
heavily
the
tension
increased
with
each
new
day
i
shot
ptarmigan
and
kept
our
table
supplied
with
william
chopped
wood
conversed
with
his
mules
and
cooked
very
badly
see
here
i
said
one
morning
we
have
been
in
camp
a
week
and
i
ca
stand
your
cooking
another
minute
william
who
was
washing
a
saucepan
looked
up
and
begged
me
sarcastically
to
accept
the
but
i
know
only
how
to
cook
eggs
and
there
were
no
eggs
within
some
hundred
miles
to
get
the
flavor
of
the
breakfast
out
of
my
mouth
i
walked
up
to
my
favorite
hillock
and
sat
down
for
a
smoke
the
next
moment
however
i
was
on
my
feet
cheering
excitedly
and
shouting
for
william
here
come
instructions
at
last
i
cried
pointing
to
the
southward
where
two
dots
on
the
grassy
plain
were
imperceptibly
moving
in
our
direction
people
on
mules
said
william
without
enthusiasm
they
must
be
messengers
for
us
i
cried
in
chaste
joy
three
cheers
for
the
northward
trail
william
and
the
mischief
take
miss
well
never
mind
now
i
added
on
them
approachin
mules
observed
william
there
is
wimmen
i
stared
at
him
for
a
second
then
attempted
to
strike
him
he
dodged
wearily
and
repeated
his
incredible
remark
there
is
wimmen
two
female
ladies
onto
them
there
mules
bring
me
my
glasses
i
said
hoarsely
bring
me
those
glasses
william
because
i
shall
destroy
you
if
you
do
somewhat
awed
by
my
calm
fury
he
hastened
back
to
camp
and
returned
with
the
binoculars
it
was
a
breathless
moment
i
adjusted
the
lenses
with
a
steady
hand
and
raised
them
now
of
all
unexpected
sights
my
fate
may
reserve
for
me
in
the
future
i
trust
nay
i
know
that
none
can
ever
prove
as
unwelcome
as
the
sight
i
perceived
through
my
binoculars
for
upon
the
backs
of
those
distant
mules
were
two
women
and
the
first
one
was
miss
smawl
upon
her
head
she
wore
a
helmet
from
which
fluttered
a
green
veil
otherwise
she
was
clothed
in
tweeds
and
at
moments
she
beat
upon
her
mule
with
a
thick
umbrella
surfeited
with
the
sickening
spectacle
i
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
tried
to
cry
i
told
yer
so
observed
william
but
i
was
too
tired
to
attack
him
when
the
caravan
rode
into
camp
i
was
myself
again
smilingly
prepared
for
the
worst
and
i
advanced
cap
in
hand
followed
furtively
by
william
welcome
i
said
violently
injecting
joy
into
my
voice
welcome
professor
smawl
to
the
hudson
mountains
kindly
take
my
mule
she
said
climbing
down
to
mother
earth
william
i
said
with
dignity
take
the
lady
mule
miss
smawl
gave
me
a
stolid
glance
then
made
directly
for
the
where
a
kettle
of
simmered
over
the
coals
the
last
i
saw
of
her
she
was
smelling
of
it
and
i
turned
my
back
and
advanced
towards
the
second
lady
pilgrim
prepared
to
be
civil
until
snubbed
now
it
is
quite
certain
that
never
before
had
william
spike
or
i
beheld
so
much
feminine
loveliness
in
one
human
body
on
the
back
of
a
mule
she
was
clad
in
the
daintiest
of
yet
there
was
nothing
mannish
about
her
except
the
way
she
rode
the
mule
and
that
only
accentuated
her
adorable
femininity
i
remembered
what
professor
lesard
had
said
about
blue
stockings
but
miss
dorothy
van
twiller
were
gray
turned
over
at
the
tops
and
disappearing
into
canvas
spats
buckled
across
a
pair
of
slim
welcome
said
i
attempting
to
restrain
a
too
violent
cordiality
welcome
professor
van
twiller
to
the
hudson
mountains
thank
you
she
replied
accepting
my
assistance
very
sweetly
it
is
a
pleasure
to
meet
a
human
being
again
i
glanced
at
miss
smawl
she
was
eating
but
she
resembled
a
human
being
in
a
general
way
i
should
very
much
like
to
wash
my
hands
said
professor
van
twiller
drawing
the
buckskin
gloves
from
her
slim
fingers
i
brought
towels
and
soap
and
conducted
her
to
the
brook
she
called
to
professor
smawl
to
join
her
and
her
voice
was
crystalline
professor
smawl
declined
and
her
voice
was
batrachian
she
is
so
hungry
observed
miss
van
twiller
i
am
very
thankful
we
are
here
at
last
for
we
had
a
horrid
time
you
see
we
neither
of
us
know
how
to
cook
i
wondered
what
they
would
say
to
william
cooking
but
i
held
my
peace
and
retired
leaving
the
little
brook
to
mirror
the
sweetest
face
that
was
ever
bathed
in
water
viii
that
afternoon
our
expedition
in
two
sections
moved
forward
the
first
section
comprised
myself
and
all
the
mules
the
second
section
was
commanded
by
professor
smawl
followed
by
professor
van
twiller
armed
with
a
tiny
william
loaded
down
with
the
toilet
articles
skulked
in
the
rear
i
say
skulked
there
was
no
other
word
for
it
so
you
a
guide
are
you
observed
professor
smawl
when
william
cap
in
hand
had
approached
her
with
advice
the
woods
are
full
of
lazy
guides
pick
up
those
gladstone
bags
i
do
the
guiding
for
this
expedition
made
cautious
by
william
humiliation
i
associated
with
the
mules
exclusively
nevertheless
professor
smawl
had
her
hard
eyes
on
me
and
i
realized
she
meant
mischief
the
encounter
took
place
just
as
i
driving
the
five
mules
entered
the
great
mountain
gateway
thrilled
with
anticipation
which
almost
amounted
to
foreboding
as
i
was
about
to
set
foot
across
the
imaginary
frontier
which
divided
the
world
from
the
unknown
land
professor
smawl
hailed
me
and
i
halted
until
she
came
up
as
commander
of
this
expedition
she
said
somewhat
out
of
breath
i
desire
to
be
the
first
living
creature
who
has
ever
set
foot
behind
the
graham
glacier
kindly
step
aside
young
sir
madam
said
i
rigid
with
disappointment
my
guide
william
spike
entered
that
unknown
land
a
year
ago
he
he
did
sneered
professor
smawl
as
you
like
i
replied
but
it
is
scarcely
generous
to
forestall
the
person
whose
stupidity
gave
you
the
clew
to
this
unexplored
region
you
mean
yourself
she
asked
with
a
stony
stare
i
do
said
i
firmly
her
little
hard
eyes
grew
harder
and
she
clutched
her
umbrella
until
the
steel
ribs
crackled
young
man
she
said
insolently
if
i
could
have
gotten
rid
of
you
i
should
have
done
so
the
day
i
was
appointed
president
but
professor
farrago
refused
to
resign
unless
your
position
was
assured
subject
of
course
to
your
good
behavior
frankly
i
do
like
you
and
i
consider
your
views
on
science
ridiculous
and
if
an
opportunity
presents
itself
i
will
be
most
happy
to
request
your
resignation
kindly
collect
your
mules
and
follow
me
mortified
beyond
measure
i
collected
my
mules
and
followed
my
president
into
the
strange
country
behind
the
hudson
mountains
i
who
had
aspired
to
lead
compelled
to
follow
in
the
rear
driving
mules
the
journey
was
monotonous
at
first
but
we
shortly
ascended
a
ridge
from
which
we
could
see
stretching
out
below
us
the
wilderness
where
save
the
feet
of
william
spike
no
human
feet
had
passed
as
for
me
tingling
with
enthusiasm
i
forgot
my
chagrin
i
forgot
the
gross
injustice
i
forgot
my
mules
excelsior
i
cried
running
up
and
down
the
ridge
in
uncontrollable
excitement
at
the
sublime
spectacle
of
forest
mountain
and
valley
all
set
with
little
lakes
excelsior
repeated
an
excited
voice
at
my
side
and
professor
van
twiller
sprang
to
the
ridge
beside
me
her
eyes
bright
as
stars
exalted
inspired
by
the
mysterious
beauty
of
the
view
we
clasped
hands
and
ran
up
and
down
the
grassy
ridge
that
will
do
said
professor
smawl
coldly
as
we
raced
about
like
a
pair
of
distracted
kittens
the
chilling
voice
broke
the
spell
i
dropped
professor
van
twiller
hand
and
sat
down
on
a
bowlder
aching
with
wrath
late
that
afternoon
we
halted
beside
a
tiny
lake
deep
in
the
unknown
wilderness
where
purple
and
scarlet
bergamot
choked
the
shores
and
the
strutted
fearlessly
under
our
very
feet
here
we
pitched
our
two
tents
the
afternoon
sun
slanted
through
the
pines
the
lake
glittered
acres
of
golden
brake
perfumed
the
forest
silence
broken
only
at
rare
intervals
by
the
distant
thunder
of
a
partridge
drumming
professor
smawl
ate
heavily
and
retired
to
her
tent
to
lie
torpid
until
evening
william
drove
the
unloaded
mules
into
an
intervale
full
of
fragrant
grasses
i
sat
down
beside
professor
van
twiller
the
wilderness
is
electric
once
within
the
influence
of
its
currents
human
beings
become
positively
or
negatively
charged
violently
attracting
or
repelling
each
other
there
is
something
the
matter
with
this
air
said
professor
van
twiller
it
makes
me
feel
as
though
i
were
desperately
enamoured
of
the
entire
human
race
she
leaned
back
against
a
pine
smiling
vaguely
and
crossing
one
knee
over
the
other
now
i
am
not
bold
by
temperament
and
normally
i
fear
ladies
therefore
it
surprised
me
to
hear
myself
begin
a
frivolous
replying
to
her
pretty
epigrams
with
epigrams
of
my
own
advancing
to
the
borderland
of
badinage
fearlessly
conducting
her
and
myself
over
that
delicate
frontier
to
meet
upon
the
terrain
of
undisguised
flirtation
it
was
clear
that
she
was
out
for
a
holiday
the
seriousness
and
restraints
of
years
she
had
left
behind
her
in
the
civilized
world
and
now
with
a
shrug
of
her
young
shoulders
she
unloosened
her
burden
of
reticence
dignity
and
responsibility
and
let
the
whole
load
fall
with
a
discreet
thud
even
hares
go
mad
in
march
she
said
seriously
i
know
you
intend
to
flirt
with
me
and
i
do
care
anyway
there
nothing
else
to
do
is
there
suppose
said
i
solemnly
i
should
take
you
behind
that
big
tree
and
attempt
to
kiss
you
the
prospect
did
not
appear
to
appall
her
so
i
looked
around
with
that
sneaking
yet
conciliatory
caution
peculiar
to
young
men
who
are
novices
in
the
art
before
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
neither
william
nor
the
mules
were
observing
us
professor
van
twiller
rose
to
her
feet
and
took
a
short
step
backward
let
set
traps
for
a
dingue
she
said
will
you
i
looked
at
the
big
tree
undecided
come
on
she
said
i
show
you
how
and
away
we
went
into
the
woods
she
leading
her
kilts
flashing
through
the
golden
now
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
how
to
trap
the
dingue
but
professor
van
twiller
asserted
that
it
formerly
fed
on
the
tender
tips
of
the
spruce
quoting
darwin
as
her
authority
so
we
gathered
a
bushel
of
piled
them
on
the
bank
of
a
little
stream
then
built
a
miniature
stockade
around
the
bait
a
foot
high
i
roofed
this
with
hemlock
then
laboriously
whittled
out
and
adjusted
a
swinging
shutter
for
the
entrance
setting
it
on
springy
twigs
the
dingue
you
know
was
supposed
to
live
in
the
water
she
said
kneeling
beside
me
over
our
trap
i
took
her
little
hand
and
thanked
her
for
the
information
doubtless
she
said
enthusiastically
a
dingue
will
come
out
of
the
lake
to
feed
on
our
then
she
added
got
him
true
i
said
earnestly
and
pressed
her
fingers
very
gently
her
face
was
turned
a
little
away
i
do
remember
what
she
said
i
do
remember
that
she
said
anything
a
faint
stole
over
her
cheek
a
few
moments
later
she
said
you
must
not
do
that
again
it
was
quite
late
when
we
strolled
back
to
camp
long
before
we
came
in
sight
of
the
twin
tents
we
heard
a
deep
voice
bawling
our
names
it
was
professor
smawl
and
she
pounced
upon
dorothy
and
drove
her
ignominiously
into
the
tent
as
for
you
she
said
in
hollow
tones
you
may
explain
your
conduct
at
once
or
place
your
resignation
at
my
disposal
but
somehow
or
other
i
appeared
to
be
temporarily
lost
to
shame
and
i
only
smiled
at
my
infuriated
president
and
entered
my
own
tent
with
a
step
that
was
distinctly
frolicsome
billy
said
i
to
william
spike
who
regarded
me
morosely
from
the
depths
of
the
tent
i
going
out
to
bag
a
mammoth
so
kindly
clean
my
and
bring
an
axe
to
chop
out
the
tusks
that
night
professor
smawl
complained
bitterly
of
the
cooking
but
as
neither
dorothy
nor
i
knew
how
to
improve
it
she
revenged
herself
on
us
by
eating
everything
on
the
table
and
retiring
to
bed
taking
dorothy
with
her
i
could
not
sleep
very
well
the
mosquitoes
were
intrusive
and
professor
smawl
dreamed
she
was
a
pack
of
wolves
and
yelped
in
her
sleep
bird
ai
she
said
william
roused
from
slumber
by
her
weird
noises
dorothy
much
frightened
crawled
out
of
her
tent
where
her
still
dreamed
dyspeptically
and
william
and
i
made
her
comfortable
by
the
it
takes
a
pretty
girl
to
look
pretty
half
asleep
in
a
blanket
are
you
sure
you
are
quite
well
i
asked
her
to
make
sure
i
tested
her
pulse
for
an
hour
it
varied
more
or
less
but
without
alarming
either
of
us
then
she
went
back
to
bed
and
i
sat
alone
by
the
towards
midnight
i
suddenly
began
to
feel
that
strange
distant
vibration
that
i
had
once
before
felt
as
before
the
vibration
grew
on
the
still
air
increasing
in
volume
until
it
became
a
sound
then
died
out
into
silence
i
rose
and
stole
into
my
tent
william
white
as
death
lay
in
his
corner
weeping
in
his
sleep
i
roused
him
remorselessly
and
he
sat
up
scowling
but
refused
to
tell
me
what
he
had
been
dreaming
was
it
about
that
third
thing
you
saw
i
began
but
he
snarled
up
at
me
like
a
startled
animal
and
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
and
toss
about
and
speculate
the
next
morning
it
rained
dorothy
and
i
visited
our
but
found
nothing
in
it
we
were
inclined
however
to
stay
out
in
the
rain
behind
a
big
tree
but
professor
smawl
vetoed
that
proposition
and
sent
me
off
to
supply
the
larder
with
fresh
meat
i
returned
mad
and
wet
with
a
dozen
partridges
and
a
white
hare
brown
at
that
season
and
william
cooked
them
vilely
i
can
taste
the
feathers
said
professor
smawl
indignantly
there
is
no
accounting
for
taste
i
said
with
a
polite
gesture
of
deprecation
personally
i
find
feathers
unpalatable
you
may
hand
in
your
resignation
this
evening
cried
professor
smawl
in
hollow
tones
of
passion
i
passed
her
the
pancakes
with
a
cheerful
smile
and
flippantly
pressed
the
hand
next
me
unexpectedly
it
proved
to
be
sticky
fist
and
dorothy
and
i
laughed
until
her
tears
ran
into
professor
smawl
an
accident
which
kindled
her
wrath
to
red
heat
and
she
requested
my
resignation
five
times
during
the
evening
the
next
day
it
rained
again
more
or
less
professor
smawl
complained
of
the
cooking
demanded
my
resignation
and
finally
marched
out
to
explore
lugging
the
reluctant
william
with
her
dorothy
and
i
sat
down
behind
the
largest
tree
we
could
find
i
do
remember
what
we
were
saying
when
a
peculiar
sound
interrupted
us
and
we
listened
earnestly
it
was
like
a
bell
in
the
woods
a
low
mellow
golden
harmony
coming
nearer
then
stopping
i
clasped
dorothy
in
my
arms
in
my
excitement
it
is
the
note
of
the
dingue
i
whispered
and
that
explains
its
name
handed
down
from
remote
ages
along
with
the
names
of
the
behemoth
and
the
coney
it
was
because
of
its
cry
that
it
was
named
darling
i
cried
forgetting
our
short
acquaintance
we
have
made
a
discovery
that
the
whole
world
will
ring
with
hand
in
hand
we
tiptoed
through
the
forest
to
our
trap
there
was
something
in
it
that
took
fright
at
our
approach
and
rushed
round
and
round
the
interior
of
the
trap
uttering
its
which
sounded
like
the
jangling
of
a
whole
string
of
bells
i
seized
the
strangely
beautiful
creature
it
neither
attempted
to
bite
nor
scratch
but
crouched
in
my
arms
trembling
and
eying
me
delighted
with
the
lovely
tame
animal
we
bore
it
tenderly
back
to
the
camp
and
placed
it
on
my
blanket
hand
in
hand
we
stood
before
it
awed
by
the
sight
of
this
beast
so
long
believed
to
be
extinct
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
sighed
dorothy
clasping
her
white
hands
under
her
chin
and
gazing
at
the
dingue
in
rapture
yes
said
i
solemnly
you
and
i
my
child
are
face
to
face
with
the
fabled
dingue
let
us
continue
to
gaze
at
it
reverently
prayerfully
humbly
dorothy
yawned
probably
with
excitement
we
were
still
mutely
adoring
the
dingue
when
professor
smawl
burst
into
the
tent
at
a
bawling
hoarsely
for
her
kodak
and
dorothy
seized
her
triumphantly
by
the
arm
and
pointed
at
the
dingue
which
appeared
to
be
frightened
to
death
what
cried
professor
smawl
scornfully
a
dingue
rubbish
madam
i
said
firmly
it
is
a
dingue
it
a
monodactyl
see
it
has
but
a
single
toe
bosh
she
retorted
it
got
four
four
i
repeated
blankly
yes
one
on
each
foot
of
course
i
said
you
did
suppose
a
monodactyl
meant
a
beast
with
one
leg
and
one
toe
but
she
laughed
hatefully
and
declared
it
was
a
woodchuck
we
squabbled
for
a
while
until
i
saw
the
significance
of
her
attitude
the
unfortunate
woman
wished
to
find
a
dingue
first
and
be
accredited
with
the
discovery
i
lifted
the
dingue
in
both
hands
and
shook
the
creature
gently
until
the
chiming
of
its
protestations
filled
our
ears
like
sweet
bells
jangled
out
of
tune
pale
with
rage
at
this
final
proof
of
the
dingue
identity
she
seized
her
camera
and
i
have
any
time
to
waste
over
that
musical
woodchuck
she
shouted
and
bounced
out
of
the
tent
what
have
you
discovered
dear
cried
dorothy
running
after
her
a
mammoth
bawled
professor
smawl
triumphantly
and
i
going
to
photograph
him
neither
dorothy
nor
i
believed
her
we
watched
the
flight
of
the
infatuated
woman
in
silence
and
now
at
last
the
tragic
shadow
falls
over
my
paper
as
i
write
i
was
never
passionately
attached
to
professor
smawl
yet
i
would
gladly
refrain
from
chronicling
the
episode
that
must
follow
if
as
i
have
hitherto
attempted
i
succeed
in
sticking
to
the
unornamented
truth
i
have
said
that
neither
dorothy
nor
i
believed
her
i
do
know
why
unless
it
was
that
we
had
not
yet
made
up
our
minds
to
believe
that
the
mammoth
still
existed
on
earth
so
when
professor
smawl
disappeared
in
the
forest
scuttling
through
the
underbrush
like
a
demoralized
hen
we
viewed
her
flight
with
unconcern
there
was
a
large
tree
in
the
neighborhood
a
pleasant
shelter
in
case
of
rain
so
we
sat
down
behind
it
although
the
sun
was
shining
fiercely
it
was
one
of
those
peaceful
afternoons
in
the
wilderness
when
the
whole
forest
dreams
and
the
shadows
are
asleep
and
every
little
leaflet
takes
a
nap
under
the
still
the
dappled
sunlight
motionless
soaked
the
sod
the
no
longer
whirled
in
circles
but
sat
sunning
their
wings
on
slender
the
heat
was
sweet
and
spicy
the
sun
drew
out
the
delicate
essence
of
gum
and
sap
warming
volatile
juices
until
they
exhaled
through
the
aromatic
bark
the
sun
went
down
into
the
wilderness
the
forest
stirred
in
its
sleep
a
fish
splashed
in
the
lake
the
spell
was
broken
presently
the
wind
began
to
rise
somewhere
far
away
in
the
unknown
land
i
heard
it
coming
nearer
nearer
a
brisk
wind
that
grew
heavier
and
blew
harder
as
it
neared
us
a
gale
that
swept
distant
branches
a
furious
gale
that
set
limbs
clashing
and
cracking
nearer
and
nearer
crack
and
the
gale
grew
to
a
hurricane
trampling
trees
like
dead
twigs
crack
crackle
crash
crash
it
the
wind
with
the
roaring
in
my
ears
i
sprang
up
staring
into
the
forest
vista
and
at
the
same
instant
out
of
the
crashing
forest
sped
professor
smawl
skirts
tucked
up
thin
legs
flying
like
i
shouted
but
the
crashing
drowned
my
voice
then
all
at
once
the
solid
earth
began
to
shake
and
with
the
rush
and
roar
of
a
tornado
a
gigantic
living
thing
burst
out
of
the
forest
before
our
eyes
a
vast
shadowy
bulk
that
rocked
and
rolled
along
mowing
down
trees
in
its
course
two
great
crescents
of
ivory
curved
from
its
head
its
back
swept
through
the
tossing
once
it
bellowed
like
a
gun
fired
from
a
high
bastion
the
apparition
passed
with
the
noise
of
thunder
rolling
on
towards
the
ends
of
the
earth
crack
crash
went
the
trees
the
tempest
swept
away
in
a
rolling
volley
of
reports
distant
more
distant
until
long
after
the
tumult
had
deadened
then
ceased
the
stunned
forest
echoed
with
the
fall
of
mangled
branches
slowly
dropping
that
evening
an
agitated
young
couple
sat
close
together
in
the
deserted
camp
calling
timidly
at
intervals
for
professor
smawl
and
william
spike
i
say
timidly
because
it
is
correct
we
did
not
care
to
have
a
mammoth
respond
to
our
calls
the
lurking
echoes
across
the
lake
answered
our
cries
the
full
moon
came
up
over
the
forest
to
look
at
us
we
were
not
much
to
look
at
dorothy
was
moistening
my
shoulder
with
unfeigned
tears
and
i
afraid
to
light
the
fire
sat
hunched
up
under
the
common
blanket
wildly
examining
the
darkness
around
us
chilled
to
the
spinal
marrow
i
watched
the
gray
lights
whiten
in
the
east
a
single
bird
awoke
in
the
wilderness
i
saw
the
nearer
trees
looming
in
the
mist
and
the
silver
fog
rolling
on
the
lake
all
night
long
the
darkness
had
vibrated
with
the
strange
monotone
which
i
had
heard
the
first
night
camping
at
the
gate
of
the
unknown
land
my
brain
seemed
to
echo
that
subtle
harmony
which
rings
in
the
auricular
labyrinth
after
sound
has
ceased
there
are
ghosts
of
sound
which
return
to
haunt
long
after
sound
is
dead
it
was
these
voiceless
spectres
of
a
voice
long
dead
that
stirred
the
transparent
silence
intoning
toneless
tones
i
think
i
make
myself
clear
it
was
an
uncanny
night
morning
whitened
the
east
gray
daylight
stole
into
the
woods
blotting
the
shadows
to
paler
tints
it
was
nearly
before
the
sun
became
visible
through
the
web
of
mist
a
pale
spot
of
gilt
in
the
zenith
by
this
pallid
light
i
labored
to
strike
the
two
empty
tents
gather
up
our
equipments
and
pack
them
on
our
five
mules
dorothy
aided
me
bravely
whimpering
when
i
spoke
of
professor
smawl
and
william
spike
but
abating
nothing
of
her
industry
until
we
had
the
mules
loaded
and
i
was
ready
to
drive
them
heaven
knows
whither
where
shall
we
go
quavered
dorothy
sitting
on
a
log
with
the
dingue
in
her
lap
one
thing
was
certain
this
land
was
no
place
for
women
and
i
told
her
so
we
placed
the
dingue
in
a
basket
and
tied
it
around
the
leading
neck
immediately
the
dingue
alarmed
began
dingling
like
a
it
acted
like
a
charm
on
the
other
mules
and
they
gravely
filed
off
after
their
leader
following
the
bell
dorothy
and
i
hand
in
hand
brought
up
the
rear
i
shall
never
forget
that
scene
in
the
forest
the
gray
arch
of
the
heavens
swimming
in
mist
through
which
the
sun
peered
shiftily
the
tall
pines
wavering
through
the
fog
the
preoccupied
mules
marching
single
file
the
foggy
of
the
gentle
dingue
in
its
swinging
basket
and
dorothy
limp
kilts
dripping
with
dew
plodding
through
the
white
dusk
we
followed
the
terrible
which
the
mammoth
had
left
in
its
wake
but
there
were
no
traces
of
its
human
victims
neither
one
jot
of
professor
smawl
nor
one
solitary
tittle
of
william
spike
and
now
i
would
be
glad
to
end
this
chapter
if
i
could
i
would
gladly
leave
myself
as
i
was
there
in
the
misty
forest
with
an
arm
encircling
the
slender
body
of
my
little
companion
and
the
mules
moving
in
a
monotonous
line
and
the
dingue
discreetly
jingling
but
again
that
menacing
shadow
falls
across
my
page
and
truth
bids
me
tell
all
and
i
the
slave
of
accuracy
must
remember
my
vows
as
the
dauntless
disciple
of
truth
towards
sunset
or
that
pale
parody
of
sunset
which
set
the
forest
swimming
in
a
ghastly
colorless
haze
the
mammoth
trail
of
ruin
brought
us
suddenly
out
of
the
trees
to
the
shore
of
a
great
sheet
of
water
it
was
a
desolate
spot
northward
a
chaos
of
sombre
peaks
rose
piled
up
like
along
the
horizon
east
and
south
the
darkening
wilderness
spread
like
a
pall
westward
crawling
out
into
the
mist
from
our
very
feet
the
gray
waste
of
water
moved
under
the
dull
sky
and
flat
waves
slapped
the
squatting
rocks
heavy
with
slime
and
now
i
understood
why
the
trail
of
the
mammoth
continued
straight
into
the
lake
for
on
either
hand
black
filthy
tamarack
swamps
lay
under
ghostly
sheets
of
mist
i
strove
to
creep
out
into
the
bog
seeking
a
footing
but
the
swamp
quaked
and
the
smooth
surface
trembled
like
jelly
in
a
bowl
a
stick
thrust
into
the
slime
sank
into
unknown
depths
vaguely
alarmed
i
gained
the
firm
land
again
and
looked
around
believing
there
was
no
road
open
but
the
desolate
trail
we
had
traversed
but
i
was
in
error
already
the
leading
mule
was
wading
out
into
the
water
and
the
others
one
by
one
followed
how
wide
the
lake
might
be
we
could
not
tell
because
the
band
of
fog
hung
across
the
water
like
a
curtain
yet
out
into
this
flat
shallow
void
our
mules
went
steadily
slop
slop
slop
in
single
file
already
they
were
growing
indistinct
in
the
fog
so
i
bade
dorothy
hasten
and
take
off
her
shoes
and
stockings
she
was
ready
before
i
was
i
having
to
unlace
my
and
she
stepped
out
into
the
water
kilts
fluttering
moving
her
white
feet
cautiously
in
a
moment
i
was
beside
her
and
we
waded
forward
sounding
the
shallow
water
with
our
poles
when
the
water
had
risen
to
dorothy
knees
i
hesitated
alarmed
but
when
we
attempted
to
retrace
our
steps
we
could
not
find
the
shore
again
for
the
blank
mist
shrouded
everything
and
the
water
deepened
at
every
step
i
halted
and
listened
for
the
mules
far
away
in
the
fog
i
heard
a
dull
splashing
receding
as
i
listened
after
a
while
all
sound
died
away
and
a
slow
horror
stole
over
me
a
horror
that
froze
the
little
of
veins
in
every
limb
a
step
to
the
right
and
the
water
rose
to
my
knees
a
step
to
the
left
and
the
cold
thin
circle
of
the
flood
chilled
my
breast
suddenly
dorothy
screamed
and
the
next
moment
a
far
cry
answered
a
far
sweet
cry
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
sky
like
the
rushing
harmony
of
the
world
swift
winds
then
the
curtain
of
fog
before
us
lighted
up
from
behind
shadows
moved
on
the
misty
screen
outlines
of
trees
and
grassy
shores
and
tiny
birds
flying
thrown
on
the
vapory
curtain
in
silhouette
a
man
and
a
woman
passed
under
the
lovely
trees
arms
about
each
other
necks
near
them
the
shadows
of
five
mules
grazed
peacefully
a
dingue
gambolled
close
by
it
is
a
mirage
i
muttered
but
my
voice
made
no
sound
slowly
the
light
behind
the
fog
died
out
the
vapor
around
us
turned
to
rose
then
dissolved
while
mile
on
mile
of
a
limitless
sea
spread
away
till
like
a
quick
line
pencilled
at
a
stroke
the
horizon
cut
sky
and
sea
in
half
and
before
us
lay
an
ocean
from
which
towered
a
mountain
of
snow
or
a
gigantic
berg
of
milky
ice
for
it
was
moving
good
heavens
i
shrieked
it
is
alive
at
the
sound
of
my
crazed
cry
the
mountain
of
snow
became
a
pillar
towering
to
the
clouds
and
a
wave
of
golden
glory
drenched
the
figure
to
its
knees
figure
yes
for
a
colossal
arm
shot
across
the
sky
then
curved
back
in
exquisite
grace
to
a
head
of
awful
beauty
a
woman
head
with
eyes
like
the
blue
lake
of
heaven
ay
a
splendid
form
upright
from
the
sky
to
the
earth
in
the
sea
the
evening
clouds
drifted
across
her
brow
her
shimmering
hair
lighted
the
world
beneath
with
sunset
then
shading
her
white
brow
with
one
hand
she
bent
and
with
the
other
hand
dipped
in
the
sea
she
sent
a
wave
rolling
at
us
straight
out
of
the
horizon
it
sped
a
ripple
that
grew
to
a
wave
then
to
a
furious
breaker
which
caught
us
up
in
a
whirl
of
foam
bearing
us
onward
faster
faster
swiftly
flying
through
leagues
of
spray
until
consciousness
ceased
and
all
was
blank
yet
ere
my
senses
fled
i
heard
again
that
strange
cry
that
sweet
thrilling
harmony
rushing
out
over
the
foaming
waters
filling
earth
and
sky
with
its
soundless
vibrations
and
i
knew
it
was
the
hail
of
the
spirit
of
the
north
warning
us
back
to
life
again
looking
back
now
over
the
days
that
passed
before
we
staggered
into
the
hudson
bay
outpost
at
gravel
cove
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
neither
dorothy
nor
i
were
clothed
entirely
in
our
proper
minds
or
if
we
were
our
minds
no
doubt
must
have
been
in
the
same
condition
as
our
clothing
i
remember
shooting
ptarmigan
and
that
we
ate
them
flashes
of
memory
recall
the
steady
downpour
of
rain
through
the
endless
twilight
of
shaggy
forests
dim
days
on
the
foggy
tundra
from
which
the
wild
ducks
rose
in
thousands
then
the
stunted
hemlocks
then
the
forest
again
and
i
do
not
even
recall
the
moment
when
at
last
stumbling
into
the
smooth
path
left
by
the
graham
glacier
we
crawled
through
the
out
of
the
unknown
land
and
once
more
into
a
world
protected
by
the
lord
almighty
a
of
elbon
indians
brought
us
in
to
the
post
and
everybody
was
most
kind
that
i
remember
just
before
going
into
several
weeks
of
unpleasant
delirium
mercifully
mitigated
with
unconsciousness
curiously
enough
professor
van
twiller
was
not
very
much
battered
physically
for
i
had
carried
her
for
days
pickaback
but
the
awful
experience
had
produced
a
shock
which
resulted
in
a
nervous
condition
that
lasted
so
long
after
she
returned
to
new
york
that
the
wealthy
and
eminent
specialist
who
attended
her
insisted
upon
taking
her
to
the
riviera
and
marrying
her
i
sometimes
wonder
but
as
i
have
said
such
reflections
have
no
place
in
these
austere
pages
however
anybody
i
fancy
is
at
liberty
to
speculate
upon
the
fate
of
the
late
professor
smawl
and
william
spike
and
upon
the
mules
and
the
gentle
dingue
personally
i
am
convinced
that
the
suggestive
silhouettes
i
saw
on
that
ghastly
curtain
of
fog
were
cast
by
beatified
beings
in
some
earthly
paradise
a
mirage
of
bliss
of
which
we
caught
but
the
colorless
floating
sea
and
sky
at
all
events
neither
professor
smawl
nor
her
william
spike
ever
returned
no
exploring
expedition
has
found
a
trace
of
mule
or
lady
of
william
or
the
dingue
the
new
expedition
to
be
organized
by
barnard
college
may
penetrate
still
farther
i
suppose
that
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
be
expected
to
volunteer
but
professor
van
twiller
is
married
and
william
and
professor
smawl
ought
to
be
and
altogether
considering
the
mammoth
and
that
gigantic
and
splendid
apparition
that
bent
from
the
zenith
to
the
ocean
and
sent
a
rolling
from
the
palm
of
one
white
hand
i
say
taking
all
these
various
matters
under
consideration
i
think
i
shall
decide
to
remain
in
new
york
and
continue
writing
for
the
scientific
periodicals
besides
the
mortifying
experience
at
the
paris
exposition
has
dampened
even
my
perennially
youthful
enthusiasm
and
as
for
the
late
expedition
to
florida
heaven
knows
i
am
ready
to
repeat
it
nay
i
am
already
forming
a
plan
for
the
rescue
but
though
i
am
prepared
to
encounter
any
danger
for
the
sake
of
my
beloved
superior
professor
farrago
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
commit
indiscretions
in
order
to
pry
into
secrets
which
as
i
regard
it
concern
professor
smawl
and
william
spike
alone
but
all
this
is
in
a
measure
premature
what
i
now
have
to
relate
is
the
recital
of
an
to
that
most
astonishing
scandal
which
occurred
during
the
recent
exposition
in
paris
ix
when
the
delegates
were
appointed
to
the
international
scientific
congress
at
the
paris
exposition
of
how
little
did
anybody
imagine
that
the
great
conference
would
end
in
the
most
gigantic
scandal
that
ever
stirred
two
continents
yet
had
it
not
been
for
the
pair
of
american
newspapers
published
in
paris
this
scandal
would
never
have
been
aired
for
the
continental
press
is
so
well
muzzled
that
when
it
bites
its
teeth
merely
meet
in
the
empty
atmosphere
with
a
discreet
snap
but
to
the
yankee
nothing
excepting
the
monroe
doctrine
is
sacred
and
the
unsopped
of
the
press
bite
right
and
left
unmuzzled
the
biter
bites
it
is
his
profession
and
that
ends
the
affair
the
bitee
is
bitten
and
in
the
deplorable
argot
of
the
hour
it
is
up
to
him
so
now
that
the
scandal
has
been
well
aired
and
hung
out
to
dry
in
the
teeth
of
decency
and
the
four
winds
and
as
all
the
details
have
been
cheerfully
and
grossly
exaggerated
it
is
perhaps
the
proper
moment
for
the
truth
to
be
written
by
the
only
person
whose
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
in
the
affair
entitles
him
to
speak
for
himself
as
well
as
for
those
honorable
ladies
and
gentlemen
whose
names
and
titles
have
been
so
mercilessly
criticised
these
then
are
the
simple
facts
the
international
scientific
congress
now
adjourned
met
at
nine
in
the
morning
may
in
the
tasmanian
pavilion
of
the
paris
exposition
there
were
present
the
most
famous
scientists
of
great
britain
france
germany
russia
italy
switzerland
and
the
united
states
his
royal
highness
the
of
monaco
presided
it
is
not
necessary
now
to
repeat
the
details
of
that
preliminary
meeting
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
committees
representing
the
various
known
sciences
were
named
and
appointed
by
the
prince
of
monaco
who
had
been
unanimously
elected
permanent
chairman
of
the
conference
it
is
the
composition
of
a
single
committee
that
concerns
us
now
and
that
committee
representing
the
science
which
treats
of
bird
life
was
made
up
as
follows
chairman
his
royal
highness
the
of
monaco
members
sir
peter
grebe
great
britain
baron
de
becasse
france
his
royal
highness
king
christian
of
finland
the
countess
of
belgium
and
i
from
the
united
states
representing
the
smithsonian
institution
and
the
bronx
park
zoological
society
of
new
york
this
then
was
the
composition
of
that
now
notorious
ornithological
committee
a
modest
earnest
little
band
of
workers
bound
together
in
the
beginning
by
those
ties
of
mutual
respect
and
esteem
which
unite
all
laborers
in
the
vineyard
of
science
from
the
first
meeting
of
our
committee
science
the
great
leveller
left
no
artificial
barriers
of
rank
or
title
standing
between
us
we
were
enthusiasts
in
our
love
for
ornithology
we
found
new
inspiration
in
the
democracy
of
our
common
interests
as
for
me
i
chatted
with
my
fellows
feeling
no
restraint
myself
and
perceiving
none
the
king
of
finland
and
i
discussed
his
latest
monograph
on
the
speckled
titmouse
and
i
was
glad
to
agree
with
the
king
in
all
his
theories
concerning
the
nesting
habits
of
that
important
bird
sir
peter
grebe
a
large
red
gentleman
in
tweeds
read
us
some
notes
he
had
made
on
the
domestic
hen
and
her
reasons
for
running
ahead
of
a
horse
and
wagon
instead
of
stepping
aside
to
let
the
disturbing
vehicle
pass
the
of
monaco
took
issue
with
sir
peter
so
did
the
baron
de
becasse
and
we
were
entertained
by
a
friendly
and
marvellously
interesting
dispute
shared
in
by
three
of
the
most
profound
thinkers
of
the
century
i
shall
never
forget
the
brilliancy
of
that
argument
nor
the
modest
retorts
which
gave
us
all
a
glimpse
into
depths
of
erudition
which
impressed
us
profoundly
and
set
the
seal
on
the
bonds
which
held
us
so
closely
together
alas
that
the
seal
should
ever
have
been
broken
alas
that
the
glittering
apple
of
discord
should
have
been
flung
into
our
midst
no
not
flung
but
gently
rolled
under
our
noses
by
the
gloved
fingers
of
the
lovely
countess
messieurs
said
the
fair
countess
when
all
present
excepting
she
and
i
had
touched
upon
or
indicated
the
subjects
which
they
had
prepared
to
present
to
the
congress
messieurs
mes
confrères
i
have
been
requested
by
our
distinguished
chairman
the
of
monaco
to
submit
to
your
judgment
the
subject
which
by
favor
of
the
king
of
the
belgians
i
have
prepared
to
present
to
the
international
scientific
congress
she
made
a
pretty
courtesy
as
she
named
her
own
sovereign
and
we
all
rose
out
of
respect
to
that
most
austere
and
moral
ruler
the
king
of
belgium
but
she
said
with
a
charming
smile
of
depreciation
i
am
very
very
much
afraid
that
the
subject
which
i
have
chosen
may
not
meet
with
your
approval
gentlemen
she
stood
there
in
her
dainty
parisian
gown
and
bonnet
shaking
her
pretty
head
uncertainly
a
smile
on
her
lips
her
small
gloved
fingers
interlocked
oh
i
know
how
dreadful
it
would
be
if
this
great
congress
should
be
compelled
to
listen
to
any
hoax
like
that
which
monsieur
de
rougemont
imposed
on
the
british
royal
society
she
said
gravely
and
because
the
subject
of
my
paper
is
as
strange
as
the
strangest
phenomenon
alleged
to
have
been
noted
by
monsieur
de
rougemont
i
hesitate
she
glanced
at
the
silent
listeners
around
her
sir
peter
red
face
had
hardened
the
king
of
finland
frowned
slightly
the
of
monaco
and
baron
de
becasse
wore
anxious
smiles
but
when
her
violet
eyes
met
mine
i
gave
her
a
glance
of
encouragement
and
that
glance
i
am
forced
to
confess
was
not
dictated
by
scientific
approval
but
by
something
that
never
entirely
dries
up
in
the
mustiest
and
dustiest
of
savants
the
old
adam
implanted
in
us
all
now
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
her
subject
must
be
so
did
every
man
present
for
it
was
no
secret
that
his
majesty
of
belgium
had
been
swindled
by
some
natives
in
tasmania
and
had
paid
a
very
large
sum
of
money
for
a
skin
of
that
gigantic
bird
the
ux
which
has
been
so
often
reported
to
exist
among
the
inaccessible
peaks
of
the
tasmanian
mountains
needless
perhaps
to
say
that
the
skin
proved
a
fraud
being
nothing
more
than
a
barnum
contrivance
made
up
out
of
the
skins
of
a
dozen
ostriches
and
cassowaries
and
most
cleverly
put
together
by
chinese
workmen
at
least
such
was
the
report
made
on
it
by
sir
peter
grebe
who
had
been
sent
by
the
british
society
to
antwerp
to
examine
the
acquisition
needless
also
perhaps
to
say
that
king
leopold
of
belgium
stoutly
maintained
that
the
skin
of
the
ux
was
genuine
from
beak
to
claw
for
six
months
there
had
been
a
most
serious
difference
of
opinion
among
european
ornithologists
concerning
the
famous
ux
in
the
antwerp
museum
and
this
difference
had
promised
to
result
in
an
open
quarrel
between
a
few
belgian
savants
on
one
side
europe
and
great
britain
on
the
other
scientists
have
a
deep
rooted
horror
of
anything
that
touches
on
charlatanism
the
taint
of
trickery
not
only
alarms
them
but
drives
them
away
from
any
suspicious
subject
and
usually
ruins
scientifically
speaking
the
person
who
has
introduced
the
subject
for
discussion
therefore
it
took
no
little
courage
for
the
countess
to
touch
with
her
dainty
gloves
a
subject
which
every
scientist
in
europe
with
scarcely
an
exception
had
pronounced
fraudulent
and
unworthy
of
investigation
and
to
bring
it
before
the
great
international
congress
required
more
courage
still
for
the
person
who
could
face
in
executive
session
the
most
brilliant
intellects
in
the
world
and
openly
profess
faith
in
a
barnumized
bird
skin
either
had
no
scientific
reputation
to
lose
or
was
possessed
of
a
bravery
far
above
that
of
the
savants
who
composed
the
audience
now
when
the
pretty
countess
caught
a
flash
of
encouragement
in
my
glance
she
turned
rosy
with
gratification
and
surprise
clearly
she
had
not
expected
to
find
a
single
ally
in
the
entire
congress
her
quick
smile
of
gratitude
touched
me
and
made
me
ashamed
too
for
i
had
encouraged
her
out
of
the
pure
love
of
mischief
hoping
to
hear
the
whole
matter
threshed
before
the
congress
and
so
have
it
settled
once
for
all
it
was
a
thoughtless
thing
to
do
on
my
part
i
should
have
remembered
the
consequences
to
the
countess
if
it
were
proven
that
she
had
been
championing
a
fraud
the
ruffled
dignity
of
the
congress
would
never
forgive
her
her
scientific
career
would
practically
be
at
an
end
because
her
theories
and
observations
could
no
longer
command
respect
or
even
the
attention
of
those
who
knew
that
she
herself
had
once
been
deceived
by
a
palpable
fraud
i
looked
at
her
guiltily
already
ashamed
of
myself
for
encouraging
her
to
her
destruction
how
lovely
and
innocent
she
appeared
standing
there
reading
her
notes
in
a
low
clear
voice
fresh
as
a
child
with
now
and
then
a
delicious
upward
sweep
of
her
long
dark
lashes
with
a
start
i
came
to
my
senses
and
bestowed
a
pinch
on
myself
this
was
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
to
sentimentalize
over
a
girlish
beauty
whose
small
parisian
head
was
crammed
full
of
foolish
brave
theories
concerning
an
imposition
which
her
aged
sovereign
had
been
unable
to
detect
i
saw
the
gathering
frown
on
the
king
of
finland
dark
face
i
saw
sir
peter
grebe
grow
redder
and
redder
and
press
his
thick
lips
together
to
control
the
angry
bosh
which
need
not
have
been
uttered
to
have
been
understood
the
baron
de
becasse
wore
a
painfully
neutral
smile
which
froze
his
face
into
a
quaint
gargoyle
the
of
monaco
looked
at
his
polished
fingernails
with
a
startled
yet
abstracted
resignation
clearly
the
young
countess
had
not
a
sympathizer
in
the
committee
something
perhaps
it
was
the
latent
chivalry
which
exists
imbedded
in
us
all
perhaps
it
was
pity
perhaps
a
glimmering
dawn
of
belief
in
the
ux
skin
set
my
thoughts
working
very
quickly
the
countess
finished
her
notes
then
glanced
around
with
a
deprecating
smile
which
died
out
on
her
lips
when
she
perceived
the
silent
and
stony
hostility
of
her
a
quick
expression
of
alarm
came
into
her
lovely
eyes
would
they
vote
against
giving
her
a
hearing
before
the
congress
it
required
a
unanimous
vote
to
reject
a
subject
she
turned
her
eyes
on
me
i
rose
red
as
fire
my
head
humming
with
a
chaos
of
ideas
all
disordered
and
vague
yet
whirling
along
in
a
single
resistless
current
i
had
come
to
the
congress
prepared
to
deliver
a
monograph
on
the
great
auk
but
now
the
subject
went
overboard
as
the
birds
themselves
had
and
i
found
myself
pleading
with
the
committee
to
give
the
countess
a
hearing
on
the
ux
why
not
i
exclaimed
warmly
it
is
established
beyond
question
that
the
ux
does
exist
in
tasmania
wallace
saw
several
uxen
through
his
telescope
walking
about
upon
the
inaccessible
heights
of
the
tasmanian
mountains
darwin
acknowledged
that
the
bird
exists
professor
farrago
has
published
a
pamphlet
containing
an
accumulation
of
all
data
bearing
upon
the
ux
why
should
not
madame
la
comtesse
be
heard
by
the
entire
congress
i
looked
at
sir
peter
grebe
have
seen
this
alleged
bird
skin
in
the
antwerp
museum
he
asked
perspiring
with
indignation
yes
i
have
said
i
it
has
been
patched
up
but
how
are
we
to
know
that
the
skin
did
not
require
patching
i
have
not
found
that
ostrich
skin
has
been
used
it
is
true
that
the
tasmanians
may
have
shot
the
bird
to
pieces
and
mended
the
skin
with
bits
of
cassowary
hide
here
and
there
but
the
greater
part
of
the
skin
and
the
beak
and
claws
are
in
my
estimation
well
worth
the
serious
attention
of
savants
to
pronounce
them
fraudulent
is
in
my
opinion
rash
and
premature
i
mopped
my
brow
i
was
in
for
it
now
i
had
thrown
in
my
reputation
with
the
reputation
of
the
countess
the
displeasure
and
astonishment
of
my
confrères
was
unmistakable
in
the
midst
of
a
strained
silence
i
moved
that
a
vote
be
taken
upon
the
advisability
of
a
hearing
before
the
congress
on
the
subject
of
the
ux
after
a
pause
the
young
countess
pale
and
determined
seconded
my
motion
the
result
of
the
balloting
was
a
foregone
conclusion
the
countess
had
one
vote
she
herself
refraining
from
voting
and
the
subject
was
entered
on
the
as
acceptable
and
a
date
set
for
the
hearing
before
the
international
congress
the
effect
of
this
vote
on
our
little
committee
was
most
marked
constraint
took
the
place
of
cordiality
polite
reserve
replaced
that
guileless
and
courtesy
with
which
our
proceedings
had
begun
with
icy
politeness
the
of
monaco
asked
me
to
state
the
subject
of
the
paper
i
proposed
to
read
before
the
congress
and
i
replied
quietly
that
as
i
was
partly
responsible
for
advocating
the
discussion
of
the
ux
i
proposed
to
associate
myself
with
the
countess
in
that
matter
if
madame
la
comtesse
would
accept
the
offer
of
a
brother
savant
indeed
i
will
she
said
impulsively
her
blue
eyes
soft
with
gratitude
very
well
observed
sir
peter
grebe
swallowing
his
indignation
and
waddling
off
towards
the
door
i
shall
resign
my
position
on
this
committee
yes
i
will
i
tell
you
as
the
king
of
finland
laid
a
fatherly
hand
on
sir
peter
sleeve
i
not
be
made
responsible
for
this
damn
he
choked
sputtered
then
bowed
to
the
horrified
countess
asking
pardon
and
declaring
that
he
yielded
to
nobody
in
respect
for
the
gentler
sex
and
he
retired
with
the
baron
de
becasse
but
out
in
the
hallway
i
heard
him
explode
confound
it
this
is
no
place
for
petticoats
baron
and
as
for
that
yankee
ornithologist
he
hung
himself
with
the
countess
corset
string
yes
he
has
do
tell
me
baron
the
young
idiot
was
all
right
until
the
countess
looked
at
him
i
tell
you
gad
how
she
crumpled
him
up
with
those
blue
eyes
of
hers
what
the
devil
do
women
come
into
such
committees
for
eh
it
an
outrage
i
tell
you
why
the
whole
world
will
jeer
at
us
if
we
sit
and
listen
to
her
monograph
on
that
fraudulent
bird
the
young
countess
who
was
writing
near
the
window
could
not
have
heard
this
outburst
but
i
heard
it
and
so
did
king
christian
and
the
of
monaco
lord
thought
i
the
countess
and
i
are
in
the
this
time
i
do
what
i
can
to
keep
us
both
out
of
the
fire
when
the
king
and
the
had
made
their
adieux
to
the
countess
and
she
had
responded
pale
and
serious
they
came
over
to
where
i
was
standing
looking
out
on
the
seine
though
we
must
differ
from
you
said
the
king
kindly
we
wish
you
all
success
in
this
dangerous
undertaking
i
thanked
him
you
are
a
young
man
to
risk
a
reputation
already
established
remarked
the
then
added
you
are
braver
than
ridicule
is
a
barrier
to
all
knowledge
and
though
we
know
that
we
seekers
after
truth
always
bring
up
short
at
that
barrier
and
dismount
not
daring
to
put
our
hobbies
to
the
fence
one
can
but
come
a
cropper
said
i
and
risk
staking
our
hobbies
no
no
that
would
make
us
ridiculous
and
ridicule
kills
in
europe
it
somewhat
deadly
in
america
too
i
said
smiling
the
more
honor
to
you
said
the
gravely
oh
i
am
not
the
only
one
i
answered
lightly
there
is
my
confrère
professor
hyssop
who
studies
apparitions
and
braves
a
contempt
and
ridicule
which
none
of
us
would
dare
challenge
we
yankees
are
learning
slowly
some
day
we
will
find
the
lost
key
to
the
future
while
europe
is
sneering
at
those
who
are
trying
to
pick
the
lock
when
king
christian
of
finland
and
the
of
monaco
had
taken
their
hats
and
sticks
and
departed
i
glanced
across
the
room
at
the
young
countess
who
was
now
working
rapidly
on
a
apparently
quite
oblivious
of
my
presence
i
looked
out
of
the
window
again
and
my
gaze
wandered
over
the
exposition
grounds
gilt
and
scarlet
and
azure
the
palaces
rose
in
every
direction
under
a
wilderness
of
fluttering
flags
towers
minarets
turrets
golden
spires
cut
the
blue
sky
in
the
west
the
gaunt
eiffel
tower
sprawled
across
the
glittering
esplanade
behind
it
rose
the
solid
golden
dome
of
the
emperor
tomb
gilded
once
more
by
the
almighty
sun
to
amuse
the
living
rabble
while
the
dead
slumbered
in
his
imperial
crypt
himself
now
but
a
relic
for
the
amusement
of
the
people
whom
he
had
despised

down
under
my
window
in
the
asphalted
court
the
king
of
finland
was
entering
his
beautiful
victoria
an
adjutant
wearing
a
cocked
hat
and
brilliant
uniform
mounted
the
box
beside
the
coachman
the
two
postilions
straightened
up
in
their
saddles
the
four
horses
danced
then
when
the
of
monaco
had
taken
a
seat
beside
the
king
the
carriage
rolled
away
and
far
down
the
quay
i
watched
it
until
the
flutter
of
the
plumes
in
the
cocked
hat
was
all
i
could
see
of
vanishing
royalty
i
was
still
musing
there
by
the
window
listening
to
the
click
and
ringing
of
the
when
i
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
clicking
had
ceased
and
turning
i
saw
the
young
countess
standing
beside
me
thank
you
for
your
chivalrous
impulse
to
help
me
she
said
frankly
holding
out
her
bare
hand
i
bent
over
it
i
had
not
realized
how
desperate
my
case
was
she
said
with
a
smile
i
supposed
that
they
would
at
least
give
me
a
hearing
how
can
i
thank
you
for
your
brave
vote
in
my
favor
by
giving
me
your
confidence
in
this
matter
said
i
gravely
if
we
are
to
win
we
must
work
together
and
work
hard
madame
we
are
entering
a
struggle
not
only
to
prove
the
genuineness
of
a
bird
skin
and
the
existence
of
a
bird
which
neither
of
us
has
ever
seen
but
also
a
struggle
which
will
either
make
us
famous
forever
or
render
it
impossible
for
either
of
us
ever
again
to
face
a
scientific
audience
i
know
it
she
said
quietly
and
i
understand
all
the
better
how
gallant
a
gentleman
i
have
had
the
fortune
to
enlist
in
my
cause
believe
me
had
i
not
absolute
confidence
in
my
ability
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
ux
i
should
not
selfish
as
i
am
have
accepted
your
chivalrous
offer
to
stand
or
fall
with
me
the
subtle
emotion
in
her
voice
touched
a
responsive
chord
in
me
i
looked
at
her
earnestly
she
raised
her
beautiful
eyes
to
mine
will
you
help
me
she
asked
would
i
help
her
faith
i
pass
the
balance
of
my
life
turning
to
please
her
i
did
not
attempt
to
undeceive
myself
i
realized
that
the
lightning
had
struck
me
that
i
was
desperately
in
love
with
the
young
countess
from
the
tip
of
her
bonnet
to
the
toe
of
her
small
polished
shoe
i
was
curiously
cool
about
it
too
although
my
heart
gave
a
thump
that
nigh
choked
me
and
i
felt
myself
going
red
from
temple
to
chin
if
the
countess
noticed
it
she
gave
no
sign
unless
the
pink
tint
under
her
eyes
deepening
was
a
subtle
signal
of
understanding
to
the
signal
in
my
eyes
suppose
she
said
that
i
failed
before
the
congress
to
prove
my
theory
suppose
my
investigations
resulted
in
the
exposure
of
a
fraud
and
my
name
was
held
up
to
ridicule
before
all
europe
what
would
become
of
you
monsieur
i
was
silent
you
are
already
celebrated
as
the
discoverer
of
the
mammoth
and
the
great
auk
she
persisted
you
are
young
enthusiastic
renowned
and
you
have
a
future
before
you
that
anybody
in
the
world
might
envy
i
said
nothing
and
yet
she
said
softly
you
risk
all
because
you
will
not
leave
a
young
woman
friendless
among
her
confrères
it
is
not
wise
monsieur
it
is
gallant
and
generous
and
impulsive
but
it
is
not
wisdom
don
quixote
rides
no
more
in
europe
my
friend
he
stays
at
home
seventy
million
of
him
in
america
said
i
after
a
moment
she
said
i
believe
you
monsieur
it
is
true
enough
i
said
with
a
laugh
we
are
the
only
people
who
tilt
at
windmills
these
days
we
and
our
cousins
the
british
who
taught
us
i
bowed
gayly
and
added
with
your
colors
to
wear
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
breaking
a
lance
against
the
biggest
windmill
in
the
world
you
mean
the
citadel
of
science
she
said
smiling
and
its
respectability
i
replied
she
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
rolling
and
unrolling
the
scroll
in
her
hands
then
she
sighed
smiled
and
brightened
handing
me
the
scroll
read
it
carefully
she
said
it
is
an
outline
of
the
policy
i
suggest
that
we
follow
you
will
be
surprised
at
some
of
the
statements
yet
every
word
is
the
truth
and
monsieur
your
reward
for
the
devotion
you
have
offered
will
be
no
greater
than
you
deserve
when
you
find
yourself
doubly
famous
for
our
joint
monograph
on
the
ux
without
your
vote
in
the
committee
i
should
have
been
denied
a
hearing
even
though
i
produced
proofs
to
support
my
theory
i
appreciate
that
i
do
most
truly
appreciate
the
courage
which
prompted
you
to
defend
a
woman
at
the
risk
of
your
own
ruin
come
to
me
this
evening
at
nine
i
hold
for
you
in
store
a
surprise
and
pleasure
which
you
do
not
dream
of
ah
but
i
do
i
said
slowly
under
the
spell
of
her
delicate
beauty
and
enthusiasm
how
can
you
she
said
laughing
you
do
know
what
awaits
you
at
nine
this
evening
you
i
said
fascinated
the
color
swept
her
face
she
dropped
me
a
deep
courtesy
at
nine
then
she
said
no
rue
i
bowed
took
my
hat
gloves
and
stick
and
attended
her
to
her
carriage
below
long
after
the
victoria
had
whirled
away
down
the
crowded
quay
i
stood
looking
after
it
mazed
in
the
web
of
that
ancient
enchantment
whose
spell
fell
over
the
first
man
in
eden
and
whose
sorcery
shall
not
fail
till
the
last
man
returns
his
soul
x
i
lunched
at
my
lodgings
on
the
quai
malthus
and
i
had
but
little
appetite
having
fed
upon
such
an
unexpected
variety
of
emotions
during
the
morning
now
although
i
was
already
heels
over
head
in
love
i
do
not
believe
that
loss
of
appetite
was
the
result
of
that
alone
i
was
slowly
beginning
to
realize
what
my
recent
attitude
might
cost
me
not
only
in
an
utter
collapse
of
my
scientific
career
and
the
consequent
material
ruin
which
was
likely
to
follow
but
in
the
loss
of
all
my
friends
at
home
the
zoological
society
of
bronx
park
and
the
smithsonian
institution
of
washington
had
sent
me
as
their
trusted
delegate
leaving
it
entirely
to
me
to
choose
the
subject
on
which
i
was
to
speak
before
the
international
congress
what
then
would
be
their
attitude
when
they
learned
that
i
had
chosen
to
uphold
the
dangerous
theory
of
the
existence
of
the
ux
would
they
repudiate
me
and
send
another
delegate
to
replace
me
would
they
merely
wash
their
hands
of
me
and
let
me
go
to
my
own
destruction
i
will
know
soon
enough
thought
i
for
this
morning
proceedings
will
have
been
cabled
to
new
york
ere
now
and
read
at
the
of
every
old
naturalist
in
america
before
i
see
the
countess
this
evening
and
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
roll
of
paper
which
she
had
given
me
and
lighting
a
cigar
lay
back
in
my
chair
to
read
it
the
manuscript
had
been
beautifully
and
i
had
no
trouble
in
following
her
brief
clear
account
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
notorious
had
been
obtained
as
for
the
story
itself
it
was
somewhat
fishy
but
i
manfully
swallowed
my
growing
nervousness
and
comforted
myself
with
the
belief
of
darwin
in
the
existence
of
the
ux
and
the
subsequent
testimony
of
wallace
who
simply
stated
what
he
had
seen
through
his
telescope
and
then
left
it
to
others
to
identify
the
enormous
birds
he
described
as
he
had
observed
them
stalking
about
on
the
snowy
peaks
of
the
tasmanian
alps
my
own
knowledge
of
the
ux
was
confined
to
a
single
circumstance
when
in
i
had
gone
to
tasmania
with
professor
farrago
to
make
a
report
on
the
availability
of
the
tasmanian
devil
as
a
substitute
for
the
mongoose
in
the
west
indies
i
of
course
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
among
the
natives
concerning
the
birds
which
they
affirmed
haunted
the
summits
of
the
mountains
our
time
in
tasmania
was
too
limited
to
admit
of
an
exploration
then
but
although
we
were
perfectly
aware
that
the
summits
of
the
tasmanian
alps
are
inaccessible
we
certainly
should
have
attempted
to
gain
them
had
not
the
time
set
for
our
departure
arrived
before
we
had
completed
the
investigation
for
which
we
were
sent
one
relic
however
i
carried
away
with
me
it
was
a
single
greenish
bronzed
feather
found
high
up
in
the
mountains
by
a
native
and
sold
to
me
for
a
somewhat
large
sum
of
money
darwin
believed
the
ux
to
be
covered
with
greenish
plumage
wallace
was
too
far
away
to
observe
the
color
of
the
great
birds
but
all
the
natives
of
tasmania
unite
in
affirming
that
the
plumage
of
the
ux
is
green
it
was
not
only
the
color
of
this
feather
that
made
me
an
eager
purchaser
it
was
the
extraordinary
length
and
size
i
knew
of
no
living
bird
large
enough
to
wear
such
a
feather
as
for
the
color
that
might
have
been
tampered
with
before
i
bought
it
and
indeed
testing
it
later
i
found
on
the
fronds
traces
of
sulphate
of
copper
but
the
same
thing
has
been
found
in
the
feathers
of
certain
birds
whose
color
is
metallic
green
and
it
has
been
proven
that
such
birds
pick
up
and
swallow
shining
bits
of
copper
pyrites
why
should
not
the
ux
do
the
same
thing
still
my
only
reason
for
believing
in
the
existence
of
the
bird
was
this
single
feather
i
had
easily
proved
that
it
belonged
to
no
known
species
of
bird
i
also
proved
it
to
be
similar
to
the
of
the
in
antwerp
but
the
feathers
on
the
antwerp
specimen
were
gray
and
the
longest
of
them
was
but
three
feet
in
length
while
my
huge
feather
measured
eleven
feet
from
tip
to
tip
one
might
account
for
it
supposing
the
antwerp
skin
to
be
that
of
a
young
bird
or
of
a
moulting
bird
or
perhaps
of
a
different
sex
from
the
bird
whose
feather
i
had
secured
still
these
ideas
were
not
proven
nothing
concerning
the
birds
had
been
proven
i
had
but
a
single
fact
to
lean
on
and
that
was
that
the
feather
i
possessed
could
not
have
belonged
to
any
known
species
of
bird
nobody
but
myself
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
feather
and
now
i
meant
to
cable
to
bronx
park
for
it
and
to
place
this
evidence
at
the
disposal
of
the
beautiful
countess
my
cigar
had
gone
out
as
i
sat
musing
and
i
relighted
it
and
resumed
my
reading
of
the
notes
lazily
even
a
trifle
sceptically
for
all
the
evidence
that
she
had
been
able
to
collect
to
substantiate
her
theory
of
the
existence
of
the
ux
was
not
half
as
important
as
the
evidence
i
was
to
produce
in
the
shape
of
that
enormous
green
feather
i
came
to
the
last
paragraph
smoking
serenely
and
leaning
back
comfortably
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
then
suddenly
my
attention
became
riveted
on
the
words
under
my
eyes
could
i
have
read
them
aright
could
i
believe
what
i
read
in
astonishment
which
culminated
in
an
excitement
that
stirred
the
very
hair
on
my
head
the
ux
exists
there
is
no
longer
room
for
doubt
ocular
proof
i
can
now
offer
in
the
shape
of
living
of
this
gigantic
bird
all
measures
have
been
taken
to
hatch
these
eggs
they
are
now
in
the
vast
incubator
it
is
my
plan
to
have
them
hatch
one
by
one
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
international
congress
it
will
be
the
greatest
triumph
that
science
has
witnessed
since
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
signed
susanne
either
i
cried
out
in
uncontrollable
excitement
either
that
girl
is
mad
or
she
is
the
cleverest
woman
on
earth
after
a
moment
i
added
in
either
event
i
am
going
to
marry
her
xi
that
evening
a
few
minutes
before
nine
i
descended
from
a
cab
in
front
of
no
rue
and
was
ushered
into
a
pretty
by
an
irreproachable
servant
who
disappeared
directly
with
my
card
in
a
few
moments
the
young
countess
came
in
exquisite
in
her
silvery
eyes
bright
white
arms
extended
in
a
charming
impulsive
welcome
the
touch
of
her
silky
fingers
thrilled
me
i
was
dumb
under
the
enchantment
of
her
beauty
and
i
think
she
understood
my
silence
for
her
blue
eyes
became
troubled
and
the
happy
parting
of
her
lips
changed
to
a
pensive
curve
presently
i
began
to
tell
her
about
my
feather
at
my
first
word
she
looked
up
brightly
almost
gratefully
i
fancied
and
in
another
moment
we
were
deep
in
eager
discussion
of
the
subject
which
had
first
drawn
us
together
what
evidence
i
possessed
to
sustain
our
theory
concerning
the
existence
of
the
ux
i
hastened
to
reveal
then
heart
beating
excitedly
i
asked
her
about
the
eggs
and
where
they
were
at
present
and
whether
she
believed
it
possible
to
bring
them
to
paris
all
these
questions
in
the
same
breath
which
brought
a
happy
light
into
her
eyes
and
a
delicious
ripple
of
laughter
to
her
lips
why
of
course
it
is
possible
to
bring
the
eggs
here
she
cried
am
i
sure
parbleu
the
eggs
are
already
here
monsieur
here
i
exclaimed
in
paris
in
paris
mais
oui
and
in
my
own
house
very
monsieur
come
you
shall
behold
them
with
your
own
eyes
her
eyes
were
brilliant
with
excitement
impulsively
she
stretched
out
her
rosy
hand
i
took
it
and
she
led
me
quickly
back
through
the
through
the
across
the
butler
pantry
and
into
a
long
dark
hallway
we
were
almost
running
now
i
keeping
tight
hold
of
her
soft
little
hand
she
raising
her
gown
a
trifle
hurrying
down
the
hallway
silken
petticoats
rustling
like
a
silk
banner
in
the
wind
a
turn
to
the
right
brought
us
to
the
down
we
hastened
and
then
across
the
cemented
floor
towards
a
long
shelf
pierced
with
a
match
she
whispered
breathlessly
i
struck
a
wax
match
and
touched
it
to
the
overhead
never
never
can
i
forget
what
that
flood
of
revealed
in
a
row
stood
five
large
incubators
behind
the
glass
doors
lay
in
dormant
majesty
five
enormous
eggs
the
eggs
were
lighter
somewhat
than
robins
eggs
but
not
as
pale
as
herons
eggs
each
egg
appeared
to
be
larger
than
a
large
and
was
partly
embedded
in
bales
of
five
little
silver
thermometers
inside
the
glass
doors
indicated
a
temperature
of
fahrenheit
i
noticed
that
there
was
an
automatic
arrangement
connected
with
the
pipes
which
regulated
the
temperature
i
was
too
deeply
moved
for
words
speech
seemed
superfluous
as
we
stood
there
hand
in
hand
contemplating
those
gigantic
eggs
there
is
something
in
a
silent
egg
which
moves
one
deeper
emotions
something
solemn
in
its
embryotic
inertia
something
awesome
in
its
featureless
immobility
i
know
of
nothing
on
earth
which
is
so
totally
lacking
in
expression
as
an
egg
the
great
desert
sphinx
brooding
through
its
veil
of
sand
has
not
that
tremendous
and
meaningless
dignity
which
wraps
the
colorless
oval
effort
of
a
single
domestic
hen
i
held
the
hand
of
the
young
countess
very
tightly
her
fingers
closed
slightly
then
and
there
in
the
solemn
presence
of
those
emotionless
eggs
i
placed
my
arm
around
her
supple
waist
and
kissed
her
she
said
nothing
presently
she
stooped
to
observe
the
thermometer
naturally
it
registered
fahrenheit
susanne
i
said
softly
oh
we
must
go
she
whispered
breathlessly
and
picking
up
her
silken
skirts
she
fled
up
the
i
turned
out
the
gas
with
that
instinct
of
economy
which
early
wastefulness
has
implanted
in
me
and
followed
the
countess
suzanne
through
the
suite
of
rooms
and
into
the
small
where
she
had
first
received
me
she
was
sitting
on
a
low
divan
head
bent
slowly
turning
a
sapphire
ring
on
her
finger
round
and
round
i
looked
at
her
romantically
and
then
please
do
she
said
the
correct
reply
to
this
is
why
not
very
tenderly
spoken
because
she
replied
which
was
also
the
correct
and
regular
answer
suzanne
i
said
slowly
and
passionately
she
turned
the
sapphire
ring
on
her
finger
presently
she
tired
of
this
so
i
lifted
her
passive
hand
very
gently
and
continued
turning
the
sapphire
ring
on
her
finger
slowly
to
harmonize
with
the
cadence
of
our
unspoken
thoughts
towards
midnight
i
went
home
walking
with
great
care
through
a
new
street
in
paris
paved
exclusively
with
blocks
of
air
xii
at
nine
in
the
evening
july
the
international
congress
was
to
assemble
in
the
great
of
the
belgian
scientific
pavilion
which
adjourned
the
tasmanian
pavilion
to
hear
the
countess
suzanne
read
her
paper
on
the
ux
that
morning
the
countess
and
i
with
five
furniture
vans
had
transported
the
five
great
incubators
to
the
platform
of
the
and
had
engaged
an
army
of
plumbers
and
to
make
the
connections
necessary
to
maintain
in
the
incubators
a
temperature
of
fahrenheit
a
heavy
green
curtain
hid
the
stage
from
the
body
of
the
behind
this
curtain
the
five
enormous
eggs
reposed
each
in
its
incubator
the
countess
suzanne
was
excited
and
calm
by
turns
her
cheeks
were
pink
her
lips
scarlet
her
eyes
bright
as
blue
planets
at
midnight
without
faltering
she
rehearsed
her
discourse
before
me
reading
from
her
manuscript
in
a
clear
voice
in
which
i
could
scarcely
discern
a
tremor
then
we
went
through
the
dumb
show
of
exhibiting
the
uxen
eggs
to
a
frantically
applauding
audience
she
responded
to
countless
supposititious
encores
i
leading
her
out
repeatedly
before
the
green
curtain
to
face
the
great
damp
darkened
auditorium
then
in
response
to
repeated
imaginary
recalls
she
rehearsed
the
extemporaneous
speech
thanking
the
distinguished
audience
for
their
patience
in
listening
to
an
unknown
confrère
and
confessing
her
obligations
to
me
here
i
appeared
and
bowed
in
for
my
faith
in
her
and
my
aid
in
securing
for
her
a
public
hearing
before
the
most
highly
educated
audience
in
the
world
after
that
we
retired
behind
the
curtain
to
sit
on
an
empty
box
and
eat
sandwiches
and
watch
the
last
lingering
plumbers
pasting
up
the
steam
connections
with
a
pot
of
molten
lead
the
plumbers
were
americans
brought
to
paris
to
make
repairs
on
the
american
buildings
during
the
exposition
and
we
conversed
with
them
affably
as
they
pottered
about
poking
under
the
flooring
with
lighted
candles
rubbing
their
thumbs
up
and
down
musty
old
pipes
and
prying
up
planks
in
dark
corners
they
informed
us
that
they
were
union
men
and
that
they
hoped
we
were
too
and
i
replied
that
union
was
certainly
my
ultimate
purpose
at
which
the
young
countess
smiled
dreamily
at
vacancy
we
did
not
dare
leave
the
incubators
the
plumbers
lingered
on
hour
after
hour
while
we
sat
and
watched
the
little
silver
thermometers
and
waited
it
was
time
for
the
countess
suzanne
to
dress
and
still
the
plumbers
had
not
finished
so
i
sent
a
messenger
for
her
maid
to
bring
her
trunk
to
the
and
i
despatched
another
messenger
to
my
lodgings
for
my
evening
clothes
and
fresh
linen
there
were
several
off
the
stage
here
about
six
the
countess
retired
with
her
maid
to
dress
leaving
me
to
watch
the
plumbers
and
the
thermometers
when
the
countess
suzanne
returned
radiant
and
lovely
in
an
evening
gown
of
black
lace
i
gave
her
the
roses
i
had
brought
for
her
and
hurried
off
to
dress
in
my
turn
leaving
her
to
watch
the
thermometers
i
was
not
absent
more
than
half
an
hour
but
when
i
returned
i
found
the
countess
anxiously
conversing
with
the
plumbers
and
pointing
despairingly
at
the
thermometers
which
now
registered
only
you
must
keep
up
the
temperature
i
said
those
eggs
are
due
to
hatch
within
a
few
hours
what
the
trouble
with
the
heat
the
plumber
did
not
know
but
thought
the
connections
were
defective
but
that
why
we
called
you
in
exclaimed
the
countess
ca
you
fix
things
securely
oh
we
fix
things
lady
replied
the
plumber
condescendingly
and
he
ambled
away
to
rub
his
thumb
up
and
down
a
pipe
as
we
alone
were
unable
to
move
and
handle
the
enormous
eggs
the
countess
whose
sweet
character
was
a
stranger
to
vindictiveness
or
petty
resentment
had
written
to
the
members
of
the
ornithological
committee
revealing
the
marvellous
fortune
which
had
crowned
her
efforts
in
the
search
for
evidence
to
sustain
her
theory
concerning
the
ux
and
inviting
these
gentlemen
to
aid
her
in
displaying
the
great
eggs
to
the
assembled
congress
this
she
had
done
the
night
previous
every
one
of
the
gentlemen
invited
had
come
to
her
hotel
to
view
the
eggs
with
their
own
sceptical
and
astonished
eyes
and
the
fair
young
countess
and
i
tasted
our
first
triumph
in
her
cellar
whither
we
conducted
sir
peter
grebe
the
of
monaco
baron
de
becasse
and
his
majesty
king
christian
of
finland
scepticism
and
incredulity
gave
place
to
excitement
and
unbounded
enthusiasm
the
old
king
embraced
the
countess
baron
de
becasse
attempted
to
kiss
me
sir
peter
grebe
made
a
handsome
apology
for
his
folly
and
vowed
that
he
would
do
open
penance
for
his
sins
the
poor
who
was
of
a
nervous
temperament
sat
on
the
and
wept
like
a
child
his
grief
at
his
own
touched
us
all
profoundly
so
it
happened
that
these
gentlemen
were
coming
to
give
their
aid
to
us
in
moving
the
priceless
eggs
and
lend
their
countenance
and
enthusiastic
support
to
the
young
countess
in
her
maiden
effort
sir
peter
grebe
arrived
first
all
covered
with
orders
and
decorations
and
greeted
us
affectionately
calling
the
countess
the
sweetest
lass
in
france
and
me
his
undutiful
yankee
cousin
who
had
landed
feet
foremost
at
the
expense
of
the
british
empire
the
king
of
finland
the
and
baron
de
becasse
arrived
together
a
composite
mass
of
medals
sashes
and
academy
palms
to
see
them
moving
boxes
about
straightening
chairs
and
pulling
out
rugs
reminded
me
of
those
gentlemen
who
run
out
into
the
arena
and
roll
up
carpets
after
the
acrobats
have
finished
their
turn
in
the
nouveau
cirque
i
was
aiding
the
king
of
finland
to
move
a
heavy
keg
of
nails
when
the
countess
called
out
to
me
in
alarm
saying
that
the
thermometers
had
dropped
to
fahrenheit
i
spoke
sharply
to
the
plumbers
who
were
standing
in
a
circle
behind
the
but
they
answered
sullenly
that
they
could
do
no
more
work
that
day
indignant
and
alarmed
i
ordered
them
to
come
out
to
the
stage
and
after
some
hesitation
they
filed
out
a
sulky
silent
lot
of
workmen
with
their
tools
already
gathered
up
and
tied
in
their
kits
at
once
i
noticed
that
a
new
man
had
appeared
among
them
a
stocky
man
wearing
a
and
a
shiny
silk
hat
who
is
the
here
i
asked
i
am
said
a
man
in
blue
overalls
well
said
i
why
do
you
fix
those
there
was
a
silence
the
man
in
the
silk
hat
smirked
well
said
i
come
come
that
all
right
said
the
man
in
the
silk
hat
these
men
know
their
business
without
you
tellin
them
who
are
you
i
demanded
sharply
oh
i
just
a
walkin
delegate
he
replied
with
a
sneer
a
strike
in
new
york
and
i
come
over
here
to
tie
this
here
exposition
up
see
you
mean
to
say
you
wo
let
these
men
finish
their
work
i
asked
thunderstruck
that
about
it
young
man
he
said
coolly
furious
i
glanced
at
my
watch
then
at
the
thermometers
which
now
registered
only
already
i
could
hear
the
of
the
audience
arriving
in
the
body
of
the
hall
already
a
was
turning
up
the
footlights
and
dragging
chairs
and
tables
hither
and
thither
what
will
you
take
to
stay
and
attend
to
those
i
demanded
desperately
it
ca
be
done
nohow
observed
the
man
in
the
silk
hat
that
new
york
strike
is
good
for
a
month
yet
then
turning
to
the
workmen
he
nodded
and
to
my
horror
the
whole
gang
filed
out
after
him
turning
deaf
ears
to
my
entreaties
and
threats
there
was
a
deathly
silence
then
sir
peter
exploded
into
a
vivid
shower
of
words
the
countess
pale
as
a
ghost
gave
me
a
look
the
wept
great
heaven
i
cried
the
thermometers
have
fallen
to
the
king
of
finland
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
pressed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
baron
de
becasse
ran
round
and
round
uttering
subdued
and
plaintive
screams
sir
peter
swore
steadily
gentlemen
i
cried
desperately
we
must
save
those
eggs
they
are
on
the
very
eve
of
hatching
who
will
volunteer
to
do
what
moaned
the
i
show
you
i
exclaimed
running
to
the
incubators
and
beckoning
to
the
baron
to
aid
me
in
a
moment
we
had
rolled
out
the
great
egg
made
a
nest
on
the
stage
floor
with
the
bales
of
and
placed
the
egg
in
it
one
after
another
we
rolled
out
the
remaining
eggs
building
for
each
its
nest
of
cotton
and
at
last
the
five
enormous
eggs
lay
there
in
a
row
behind
the
green
curtain
now
said
i
excitedly
to
the
king
you
must
get
up
on
that
egg
and
try
to
keep
it
warm
the
king
began
to
protest
but
i
would
take
no
denial
and
presently
his
majesty
was
perched
up
on
the
great
egg
gazing
foolishly
about
at
the
others
who
were
now
all
climbing
up
on
their
allotted
eggs
great
heaven
muttered
the
king
as
sir
peter
settled
down
comfortably
on
his
egg
i
am
willing
to
give
life
and
fortune
for
the
sake
of
science
but
i
ca
bear
to
hatch
out
eggs
like
a
bird
the
was
now
sitting
patiently
beside
the
baron
de
becasse
i
feel
in
my
bones
he
murmured
that
i
about
to
hatch
something
ca
you
hear
a
tapping
on
the
shell
of
your
egg
baron
parbleu
replied
the
baron
the
shell
is
moving
under
me
it
certainly
was
for
the
next
moment
the
baron
fell
into
his
egg
with
a
crash
and
a
muffled
shriek
and
floundered
out
dripping
yellow
as
a
canary
he
cried
excitedly
allons
save
the
eggs
hurrah
vive
la
science
and
he
scrambled
up
on
the
fourth
egg
and
sat
there
arms
folded
sublime
courage
transfiguring
him
from
head
to
foot
we
all
gave
him
a
cheer
which
was
hushed
as
the
ran
in
warning
us
that
the
audience
was
already
assembled
and
in
place
you
not
going
to
raise
the
curtain
while
we
sitting
are
you
demanded
the
king
of
finland
anxiously
no
no
i
said
sit
tight
your
majesty
courage
gentlemen
our
vindication
is
at
hand
the
countess
glanced
at
me
with
startled
eyes
i
took
her
hand
saluted
it
respectfully
and
then
quietly
led
her
before
the
curtain
facing
an
ocean
of
upturned
faces
across
the
flaring
footlights
she
stood
a
moment
to
acknowledge
the
somewhat
ragged
applause
a
calm
smile
on
her
lips
all
her
courage
had
returned
i
saw
that
at
once
very
quietly
she
touched
her
lips
to
the
laid
her
manuscript
on
the
table
raised
her
beautiful
head
and
began
that
the
ux
is
a
living
bird
i
am
here
before
you
to
prove
a
sharp
report
behind
the
curtain
drowned
her
voice
she
paled
the
audience
rose
amid
cries
of
excitement
what
was
it
she
asked
faintly
sir
peter
has
hatched
out
his
egg
i
whispered
hark
there
goes
another
egg
and
i
ran
behind
the
curtain
such
a
scene
as
i
beheld
was
never
dreamed
of
on
land
or
sea
two
enormous
young
uxen
all
over
gigantic
were
wandering
stupidly
about
mounted
on
one
was
sir
peter
grebe
eyes
starting
from
his
apoplectic
visage
on
the
other
clinging
to
the
bird
neck
hung
the
baron
de
becasse
before
i
could
move
the
two
remaining
eggs
burst
and
a
pair
of
huge
scrawny
fledglings
rose
among
the
débris
bearing
off
on
their
backs
the
king
and
help
said
the
king
of
finland
faintly
i
falling
off
i
sprang
to
his
aid
but
tripped
on
the
the
next
instant
the
green
curtain
shot
up
and
there
revealed
to
that
vast
and
distinguished
audience
roamed
four
enormous
chicks
bearing
on
their
backs
the
most
respected
and
exclusive
aristocracy
of
europe
the
countess
suzanne
turned
with
a
little
shriek
of
horror
then
sat
down
in
her
chair
laid
her
lovely
head
on
the
table
and
very
quietly
fainted
away
unconscious
of
the
frantic
cheers
which
went
roaring
to
the
roof
this
then
is
the
history
of
the
famous
exposition
scandal
and
as
i
have
said
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
in
that
audience
of
two
american
reporters
nobody
would
have
known
what
all
the
world
now
knows
nobody
would
have
read
of
the
marvellous
feats
of
bareback
riding
indulged
in
by
the
king
of
finland
nobody
would
have
read
how
sir
peter
grebe
steered
his
mount
safely
past
the
footlights
only
to
come
to
grief
over
the
prompter
box
but
this
scandal
and
as
for
the
charming
countess
suzanne
the
public
has
heard
all
that
it
is
entitled
to
hear
and
much
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
hear
however
on
second
thoughts
perhaps
the
public
is
entitled
to
hear
a
little
more
i
will
therefore
say
this
much
the
shock
of
astonishment
which
stunned
me
when
the
curtain
flew
up
revealing
the
uxen
was
nothing
to
the
awful
blow
which
smote
me
when
the
count
leaped
from
the
orchestra
over
the
footlights
and
bore
away
with
him
the
fainting
form
of
his
wife
the
lovely
countess
i
sometimes
wonder
but
as
i
have
repeatedly
observed
this
dull
and
pedantic
narrative
of
fact
is
no
vehicle
for
sentimental
soliloquy
it
is
then
merely
sufficient
to
say
that
i
took
the
earliest
steamer
for
kinder
shores
spurred
on
to
haste
by
a
venomous
from
the
smithsonian
repudiating
me
and
by
another
from
bronx
park
ordering
me
to
spend
the
winter
in
some
inexpensive
poisonous
and
unobtrusive
spot
and
make
a
collection
of
isopods
the
island
of
java
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
poisonously
unobtrusive
and
inexpensive
a
region
as
i
had
ever
heard
of
a
steamer
sailed
from
antwerp
for
batavia
in
hours
therefore
as
i
say
i
took
the
for
brussels
and
the
steamer
from
antwerp
the
following
evening
of
my
uneventful
voyage
of
the
happy
and
successful
quest
there
is
little
to
relate
the
javanese
are
frolicsome
and
hospitable
there
was
a
girl
there
with
features
that
were
as
delicate
as
though
chiselled
out
of
palest
amber
and
i
remember
she
wore
a
most
wonderful
jewelled
and
jingling
bangles
on
her
ankles
and
when
she
danced
she
made
most
graceful
and
poetic
gestures
with
her
supple
wrists
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
isopods
absolutely
nothing
letters
from
home
came
occasionally
professor
farrago
had
returned
to
the
bronx
and
had
been
to
the
high
office
he
had
so
nobly
held
when
i
first
became
associated
with
him
through
his
kindness
and
by
his
advice
i
remained
for
several
years
in
the
far
east
until
a
letter
from
him
arrived
recalling
me
and
also
announcing
his
own
hurried
and
sudden
departure
for
florida
he
also
mentioned
my
promotion
to
the
office
of
subcurator
of
department
so
i
started
on
my
homeward
voyage
very
much
pleased
with
the
world
and
arrived
in
new
york
on
april
ready
for
a
rest
to
which
i
believed
myself
entitled
and
the
first
thing
that
they
handed
me
was
a
letter
from
professor
farrago
summoning
me
south
xiii
the
letter
that
started
me
i
was
going
to
say
startled
me
but
only
imaginative
people
are
startled
the
letter
then
that
started
me
from
bronx
park
to
the
south
i
print
without
the
permission
of
my
superior
professor
farrago
i
have
not
obtained
his
permission
for
the
somewhat
exciting
reason
that
nobody
knows
where
he
is
publicity
being
now
recognized
as
the
annihilator
of
mysteries
a
benevolent
purpose
alone
inspires
me
to
publish
a
letter
so
strange
so
pathetically
remarkable
in
view
of
what
has
recently
occurred
as
i
say
i
had
only
just
returned
from
java
with
a
valuable
collection
of
undescribed
isopods
an
order
of
edriophthalmous
crustaceans
with
seven
free
thoracic
somites
furnished
with
fourteen
legs
and
i
beg
my
reader
pardon
but
my
reader
will
see
the
necessity
for
the
author
absolute
accuracy
in
insisting
on
detail
because
the
story
that
follows
is
a
dangerous
story
for
a
scientist
to
tell
in
view
of
the
vast
amount
of
nonsense
and
fiction
in
circulation
masquerading
as
stories
of
scientific
adventure
i
was
therefore
anticipating
a
delightful
summer
work
with
pen
and
microscope
when
on
april
i
received
the
following
extraordinary
letter
from
professor
farrago
in
camp
little
sprite
lake
everglades
florida
my
dear
gilland
on
receipt
of
this
communication
you
will
immediately
secure
for
me
the
following
articles
one
complete
outfit
of
woman
clothing
one
camera
one
light
steel
cage
large
enough
for
you
to
stand
in
one
stenographer
male
sex
one
steel
tank
with
siphon
and
hose
attachment
one
rifle
and
ammunition
three
ounces
rosium
oxyde
one
ounce
chlorate
strontium
you
will
then
within
hours
set
out
with
the
stenographer
and
the
supplies
mentioned
and
join
me
in
camp
on
little
sprite
lake
this
order
is
formal
and
admits
of
no
delay
you
will
appreciate
the
necessity
of
absolute
and
unquestioning
obedience
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
practically
on
the
brink
of
the
most
astonishing
discovery
recorded
in
natural
history
since
monsieur
zani
discovered
the
zoombok
in
nyanza
and
that
i
depend
upon
you
and
your
zeal
and
fidelity
for
success
i
dare
not
lest
my
letter
fall
into
unscrupulous
hands
convey
to
you
more
than
a
hint
of
what
lies
before
us
in
these
uncharted
solitudes
of
the
everglades
you
must
read
between
the
lines
when
i
say
that
because
one
can
see
through
a
sheet
of
glass
the
glass
is
none
the
less
solid
and
palpable
one
can
see
it
if
that
is
also
seeing
it
but
one
can
nevertheless
hold
it
and
feel
it
and
receive
from
it
sensations
of
cold
or
heat
according
to
its
temperature
certain
jellyfish
are
absolutely
transparent
when
in
the
water
and
one
can
only
know
of
their
presence
by
accidental
contact
not
by
sight
you
ever
thought
that
possibly
there
might
exist
larger
and
more
highly
organized
creatures
transparent
to
eyesight
yet
palpable
to
touch
little
sprite
lake
is
the
place
beyond
lie
the
everglades
the
outskirts
of
which
are
haunted
by
the
seminoles
the
interior
of
which
have
never
been
visited
by
man
as
far
as
we
know
as
you
are
aware
no
general
survey
of
florida
has
yet
been
made
there
exist
no
maps
of
the
everglades
south
of
okeechobee
even
little
sprite
lake
is
but
a
vague
blot
on
our
maps
we
know
of
course
that
south
of
the
eleven
thousand
square
miles
of
fresh
water
which
is
called
lake
okeechobee
the
everglades
form
a
vast
projection
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
square
miles
darkest
africa
is
no
longer
a
mystery
but
the
everglades
remain
the
sombre
secret
of
our
continent
and
this
unknown
expanse
of
swamps
barrens
forests
and
lagoons
is
greater
than
in
the
days
of
de
soto
because
the
entire
region
has
been
slowly
rising
all
this
my
dear
sir
you
already
know
and
i
ask
your
indulgence
for
recalling
the
facts
to
your
memory
i
do
it
for
this
reason
the
search
for
i
am
may
lead
us
to
utter
destruction
and
therefore
my
formal
orders
to
you
should
be
modified
to
this
extent
do
you
volunteer
if
you
volunteer
my
orders
remain
if
not
turn
this
letter
over
to
kingsley
who
will
find
for
me
the
companion
i
require
in
the
event
of
your
coming
you
must
break
your
journey
at
false
cape
and
ask
for
an
old
man
named
slunk
he
will
give
you
a
packet
you
will
give
him
a
dollar
and
drive
on
to
cape
canaveral
and
you
will
do
what
is
to
be
done
there
from
there
to
fort
kissimmee
to
okeechobee
traversing
the
lake
to
the
rita
river
where
i
have
marked
the
trail
to
little
sprite
at
little
sprite
i
shall
await
you
beyond
that
point
a
merciful
providence
alone
can
know
what
awaits
us
yours
fraternally
farrago
i
think
that
you
had
better
make
your
will
and
suggest
the
same
idea
to
the
stenographer
who
is
to
accompany
you
and
that
was
the
letter
i
received
while
seated
comfortably
on
the
floor
of
my
surrounded
by
innocent
isopods
all
patiently
awaiting
scientific
investigation
and
this
is
what
i
did
within
hours
i
had
assembled
the
supplies
required
the
cage
the
woman
clothing
tank
arms
and
ammunition
and
the
chemicals
i
had
secured
accommodations
for
that
evening
on
the
florida
volusia
and
fort
lauderdale
railway
as
far
as
citron
city
and
i
had
been
interviewing
stenographers
all
day
long
the
result
of
an
innocently
worded
advertisement
in
the
daily
newspapers
it
was
now
very
close
to
the
time
when
i
must
summon
a
cab
and
drive
to
the
ferry
and
yet
i
was
still
shy
one
stenographer
i
had
seen
scores
they
simply
would
not
listen
to
the
proposition
why
does
a
gentleman
in
the
backwoods
of
florida
want
a
stenographer
they
demanded
and
as
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
i
could
only
say
so
i
think
the
majority
interviewed
concluded
i
had
escaped
from
a
state
institution
as
the
time
for
departure
approached
i
became
desperate
urging
and
beseeching
applicants
to
accompany
me
but
neither
sympathy
for
my
instant
need
nor
desire
for
salary
moved
them
i
waited
until
the
last
moment
hoping
against
hope
then
with
a
groan
of
despair
i
seized
luggage
and
raincoat
made
for
the
door
and
flung
it
open
only
to
find
myself
face
to
face
with
an
attractive
young
girl
apparently
on
the
point
of
pressing
the
electric
button
i
sorry
i
said
but
i
have
a
train
to
catch
she
was
noticeably
attractive
in
her
and
pretty
hat
and
i
really
was
sorry
so
sorry
that
i
added
i
have
about
seconds
to
place
at
your
service
before
i
go
twenty
will
be
sufficient
she
replied
pleasantly
i
saw
your
advertisement
for
a
stenographer
we
require
a
man
i
interposed
hastily
have
you
engaged
him
we
looked
at
each
other
you
would
accept
anyway
i
began
how
do
you
know
you
would
leave
town
would
you
yes
if
you
required
it
what
go
to
florida
if
i
must
but
think
of
the
alligators
think
of
the
snakes
big
bitey
snakes
gracious
she
exclaimed
eyes
growing
bigger
indians
too
unreconciled
sulky
seminoles
fevers
spiders
and
only
fifty
dollars
a
week
i
i
go
she
stammered
go
i
repeated
grimly
then
you
exactly
two
and
seconds
left
for
preparations
instinctively
she
raised
her
little
gloved
hand
and
patted
her
hair
i
ready
she
said
unsteadily
one
extra
second
to
make
your
will
i
added
stunned
by
her
i
i
have
nothing
to
leave
nobody
to
leave
it
to
she
said
smiling
i
am
ready
i
took
that
extra
second
myself
for
a
lightning
course
in
reflection
upon
effects
and
consequences
it
silly
it
probably
murder
i
said
but
you
engaged
now
we
must
run
for
it
and
that
is
how
i
came
to
engage
the
services
of
miss
helen
barrison
as
stenographer
xiv
at
noon
on
the
second
day
i
disembarked
from
the
train
at
citron
city
with
all
paraphernalia
cage
chemicals
arsenal
and
stenographer
an
accumulation
of
very
dusty
impedimenta
all
but
the
stenographer
by
three
our
hotel
was
speeding
along
the
beach
at
false
cape
towards
the
tall
lighthouse
looming
above
the
dunes
the
abode
of
a
gentleman
named
slunk
was
my
goal
i
sat
brooding
in
the
rickety
carriage
still
dazed
by
the
rapidity
of
my
flight
from
new
york
the
stenographer
sat
beside
me
blue
eyes
bright
with
excitement
fair
hair
blowing
in
the
our
railway
companionship
had
been
of
the
slightest
also
absolutely
formal
for
i
was
too
absorbed
in
conjecturing
the
meaning
of
this
journey
to
be
more
than
civil
and
she
i
fancy
had
had
time
for
repentance
and
perhaps
for
a
little
fright
though
i
could
discover
traces
of
neither
i
remember
she
left
the
train
at
some
city
or
other
where
we
were
held
for
an
hour
and
out
of
the
i
saw
her
returning
with
a
grip
sack
she
must
have
bought
clothes
for
she
continued
to
remain
cool
and
fresh
in
her
summer
and
short
outing
skirt
and
she
looked
immaculate
now
sitting
there
beside
me
the
trace
of
a
smile
curving
her
red
mouth
i
looking
for
a
personage
named
slunk
i
observed
after
a
moment
silent
consideration
of
the
atlantic
ocean
she
said
when
do
my
duties
begin
mr
gilland
the
lord
alone
knows
i
replied
grimly
are
you
repenting
of
your
bargain
i
am
quite
happy
she
said
serenely
remorse
smote
me
that
i
had
consented
to
engage
this
frail
biped
for
an
enterprise
which
lay
outside
the
suburbs
of
manhattan
i
glanced
guiltily
at
my
victim
she
sat
there
the
incarnation
of
new
york
piquancy
a
translated
denizen
of
the
metropolis
a
slender
spirit
of
the
back
offices
of
why
had
i
lured
her
hither
here
where
the
heavy
breakers
thundered
on
a
lost
coast
here
where
above
the
vultures
soared
and
eagles
hulking
along
the
sands
tore
dead
fish
and
yelped
at
us
as
we
passed
strange
waters
strange
skies
a
strange
lost
land
aquiver
under
an
exotic
sun
and
there
she
sat
with
her
wise
eyes
of
a
child
unconcerned
watching
the
world
in
perfect
confidence
may
i
pay
a
little
compliment
to
your
pluck
i
asked
amused
certainly
she
said
smiling
as
the
maid
of
manhattan
alone
knows
how
to
smile
shyly
inquiringly
with
a
lingering
hint
of
laughter
in
the
curled
lips
corners
then
her
sensitive
features
fell
a
trifle
not
pluck
she
said
but
necessity
i
had
no
chance
to
choose
no
time
to
wait
my
last
dollar
gilland
is
in
my
purse
with
a
gay
little
gesture
she
drew
it
from
her
then
smiling
sat
turning
it
over
and
over
in
her
lap
the
sun
fell
on
her
hands
gilding
the
smooth
skin
with
the
first
tint
of
sunburn
under
the
corners
of
her
eyes
above
the
rounded
cheeks
a
pink
stain
lay
like
the
first
ripening
flush
on
a
wild
strawberry
that
too
was
the
mark
left
by
the
caress
of
wind
and
sun
i
had
had
no
idea
she
was
so
pretty
i
think
we
enjoy
this
adventure
i
said
do
you
i
try
to
make
the
best
of
things
she
said
gazing
off
into
the
horizon
haze
look
she
added
is
that
a
man
a
spot
far
away
on
the
beach
caught
my
eye
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
pelican
and
small
wonder
too
for
the
dumpy
waddling
individual
who
loomed
up
resembled
a
heavy
bottomed
bird
more
than
a
human
being
do
you
suppose
that
could
be
mr
slunk
asked
the
stenographer
as
our
vehicle
drew
nearer
he
looked
as
though
his
name
ought
to
be
slunk
he
was
digging
coquina
clams
and
he
dug
with
a
pecking
motion
like
a
mastering
a
mullet
too
big
for
it
his
name
was
slunk
he
admitted
it
when
i
accused
him
our
negro
driver
drew
rein
and
i
descended
to
the
sand
and
gazed
on
slunk
he
was
as
i
have
said
not
impressive
even
with
the
tremendous
background
of
sky
and
ocean
i
come
something
over
a
thousand
miles
to
see
you
i
said
reluctant
to
admit
that
i
had
come
as
far
to
see
such
a
specimen
of
human
architecture
a
grin
stretched
the
skin
that
covered
his
face
and
he
shoved
a
hairy
paw
into
the
pockets
of
his
overalls
digging
deeply
into
profound
depths
first
he
brought
to
light
a
twist
of
south
carolina
tobacco
which
he
leisurely
inserted
in
his
mouth
not
apparently
for
pleasure
but
merely
to
get
rid
of
it
the
second
object
excavated
from
the
overalls
was
a
small
packet
addressed
to
me
this
he
handed
to
me
i
gravely
handed
him
a
silver
dollar
he
went
back
to
his
and
i
entered
the
carriage
and
drove
on
all
had
been
carried
out
according
to
the
letter
of
my
instructions
so
far
and
my
spirits
brightened
if
you
do
mind
i
read
my
instructions
i
said
in
high
pray
do
not
hesitate
she
said
smiling
in
sympathy
so
i
opened
the
little
packet
and
read
drive
to
cape
canaveral
along
the
beach
you
will
find
a
gang
of
men
at
work
on
a
government
breakwater
the
superintendent
is
rowan
show
him
this
letter
farrago
rather
disappointed
for
i
had
been
expecting
to
find
in
the
packet
some
key
to
the
interesting
mystery
which
had
sent
professor
farrago
into
the
everglades
i
thrust
the
missive
into
my
pocket
and
resumed
a
study
of
the
immediate
landscape
it
had
not
changed
as
we
progressed
ocean
sand
low
dunes
crowned
with
impenetrable
tangles
of
wild
bay
sparkleberry
and
with
here
and
there
a
palmetto
sprawling
and
here
and
there
the
battered
blades
of
cactus
and
thrust
menacingly
forward
and
over
all
the
vultures
sailing
sailing
some
mere
circling
motes
lost
in
the
blue
above
some
sheering
the
earth
so
close
that
their
swiftly
sweeping
shadows
slanted
continually
across
our
road
i
detest
a
buzzard
i
said
aloud
i
thought
they
were
crows
she
confessed
yes
sing
caw
caw
only
they
do
i
added
my
song
putting
me
in
once
more
and
i
glanced
askance
at
the
pretty
stenographer
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
employed
by
agreeable
people
she
said
innocently
oh
i
can
be
much
more
agreeable
than
that
i
said
is
professor
farrago
amusing
she
asked
well
oh
certainly
but
not
in
in
the
way
i
am
suddenly
it
flashed
upon
me
that
my
superior
was
a
confirmed
hater
of
unmarried
women
i
had
clean
forgotten
it
and
now
the
full
import
of
what
i
had
done
scared
me
silent
is
anything
the
matter
asked
miss
barrison
no
not
yet
i
said
ominously
how
on
earth
could
i
have
overlooked
that
fact
the
hurry
and
anxiety
the
stress
of
instant
preparation
and
departure
had
clean
driven
it
from
my
head
jogging
on
over
the
sand
i
sat
silent
cudgelling
my
brains
for
a
solution
of
the
disastrous
predicament
i
had
gotten
into
i
pictured
the
astonished
rage
of
my
superior
my
probable
dismissal
from
employment
perhaps
the
general
overturning
and
of
the
entire
expedition
a
distant
dark
object
on
the
beach
concentrated
my
distracted
thoughts
it
must
be
the
breakwater
at
cape
canaveral
and
it
was
the
breakwater
swarming
with
negro
workmen
who
were
swinging
great
blocks
of
coquina
into
cemented
beds
singing
and
whistling
at
their
labor
i
forgot
my
predicament
when
i
saw
a
thin
white
man
in
and
khaki
directing
the
work
from
the
beach
and
as
our
horses
plodded
up
i
stepped
out
and
hailed
him
by
name
yes
my
name
is
rowan
he
said
instantly
turning
to
meet
me
his
sharp
clear
eyes
included
the
vehicle
and
the
stenographer
and
he
lifted
his
helmet
then
looked
squarely
at
me
my
name
is
gilland
i
said
dropping
my
voice
and
stepping
nearer
i
have
just
come
from
bronx
park
new
york
he
bowed
waiting
for
something
more
from
me
so
i
presented
my
credentials
his
formal
manner
changed
at
once
come
over
here
and
let
us
talk
a
bit
he
said
cordially
then
hesitated
glancing
at
miss
barrison
if
your
wife
would
excuse
us
the
pretty
stenographer
colored
and
i
dryly
set
rowan
right
which
appeared
to
disturb
him
more
than
his
mistake
pardon
me
gilland
but
you
do
not
propose
to
take
this
young
girl
into
the
everglades
do
you
that
what
i
had
proposed
to
do
i
said
brusquely
perfectly
aware
that
i
resented
his
inquiry
he
cast
a
perplexed
and
troubled
glance
at
her
then
slowly
led
the
way
to
a
great
block
of
coquina
where
he
sat
down
motioning
me
to
do
the
same
i
see
he
said
that
you
do
know
just
where
you
are
going
or
just
what
you
are
expected
to
do
no
i
do
i
said
well
i
tell
you
then
you
are
going
into
the
devil
own
country
to
look
for
something
that
i
fled
five
hundred
miles
to
avoid
is
that
so
i
said
uneasily
that
is
so
mr
gilland
oh
and
what
is
this
object
that
i
am
to
look
for
and
from
which
you
fled
five
hundred
miles
i
do
know
you
do
know
what
you
ran
away
from
no
sir
perhaps
if
i
had
known
i
should
have
run
a
thousand
miles
we
eyed
one
another
you
think
then
that
i
better
send
miss
barrison
back
to
new
york
i
asked
i
certainly
do
it
may
be
murder
to
take
her
then
i
do
it
i
said
nervously
back
she
goes
from
the
first
railroad
station
in
a
flash
the
thought
came
to
me
that
here
was
a
way
to
avoid
the
wrath
of
professor
farrago
and
a
good
excuse
too
he
might
forgive
my
not
bringing
a
man
as
stenographer
in
view
of
my
limited
time
he
never
would
forgive
my
presenting
him
with
a
woman
she
must
go
back
i
repeated
and
it
rather
surprised
me
to
find
myself
already
anticipating
loneliness
something
that
never
in
all
my
travels
had
i
experienced
before
by
the
first
train
i
added
firmly
disliking
rowan
without
any
reason
except
that
he
had
suddenly
deprived
me
of
my
stenographer
what
i
have
to
tell
you
he
began
lighting
a
cigarette
the
mate
to
which
i
declined
is
this
three
years
ago
before
i
entered
this
contracting
business
i
was
in
the
government
employ
as
officer
in
the
coast
survey
our
duties
took
us
into
florida
waters
we
were
months
at
a
time
working
on
shore
he
pulled
thoughtfully
at
his
cigarette
and
blew
a
light
cloud
into
the
air
i
had
leave
for
a
month
once
and
like
an
ass
i
prepared
to
spend
it
in
a
among
the
everglades
he
crossed
his
lean
legs
and
gazed
meditatively
at
his
cigarette
i
believe
he
went
on
that
we
penetrated
the
everglades
farther
than
any
white
man
who
ever
lived
to
return
there
nothing
very
dismal
about
the
everglades
the
greater
part
i
mean
you
get
high
and
low
hummock
marshes
creeks
lakes
and
all
that
if
you
get
lost
you
a
goner
if
you
acquire
fever
you
as
well
off
as
the
seraphim
and
not
a
whit
better
there
are
the
usual
animals
there
bears
little
black
fellows
lynxes
deer
panthers
alligators
and
a
few
stray
crocodiles
as
for
snakes
of
course
they
there
moccasins
some
rattlers
but
after
all
not
as
many
snakes
as
one
finds
in
alabama
or
even
northern
florida
and
georgia
the
seminoles
wo
help
you
wo
even
talk
to
you
they
a
sullen
pack
but
not
murderous
as
far
as
i
know
beyond
their
inner
limits
lie
the
unknown
regions
he
bit
the
wet
end
from
his
cigarette
i
went
there
he
said
i
came
out
as
soon
as
i
could
why
well
for
one
thing
my
companion
died
of
fright
fright
what
at
well
there
something
in
there
what
he
fixed
a
penetrating
gaze
on
me
i
do
know
mr
gilland
did
you
see
anything
to
frighten
you
i
insisted
no
but
i
felt
something
he
dropped
his
cigarette
and
ground
it
into
the
sand
viciously
to
cut
it
short
he
said
i
am
most
unwillingly
led
to
believe
that
there
are
creatures
of
some
sort
in
the
everglades
living
creatures
quite
as
large
as
you
or
i
and
that
they
are
perfectly
transparent
as
transparent
as
a
colorless
jellyfish
instantly
the
veiled
import
of
professor
farrago
letter
was
made
clear
to
me
he
too
believed
that
it
embarrasses
me
like
the
devil
to
say
such
a
thing
continued
rowan
digging
in
the
sand
with
his
spurred
heels
it
seems
so
so
like
a
whopping
lie
it
seems
so
childish
and
ridiculous
so
cursed
cheap
but
i
fled
and
there
you
are
i
might
add
he
said
indifferently
that
i
have
the
ordinary
portion
of
courage
allotted
to
normal
men
but
what
do
you
believe
these
these
animals
to
be
i
asked
fascinated
i
do
know
an
obstinate
look
came
into
his
eyes
i
do
know
and
i
absolutely
refuse
to
speculate
for
the
benefit
of
anybody
i
would
do
it
for
my
friend
professor
farrago
and
i
not
going
to
do
it
for
you
he
ended
laughing
a
rather
grim
laugh
that
somehow
jarred
me
into
realizing
the
amazing
import
of
his
story
for
i
did
not
doubt
it
strange
as
it
was
fantastic
incredible
though
it
sounded
in
the
ears
of
a
scientist
what
it
was
that
carried
conviction
i
do
not
know
perhaps
the
fact
that
my
superior
credited
it
perhaps
the
manner
of
narration
told
in
quiet
commonplace
phrases
by
an
exceedingly
practical
and
unimaginative
young
man
who
was
plainly
embarrassed
in
the
telling
the
story
rang
out
like
a
shout
in
a
cañon
startling
because
of
the
absolute
lack
of
emphasis
employed
in
the
telling
professor
farrago
asked
me
to
speak
of
this
to
no
one
except
the
man
who
should
come
to
his
assistance
he
desired
the
first
chance
of
clearing
this
this
rather
perplexing
matter
no
doubt
he
did
want
exploring
parties
prowling
about
him
added
rowan
smiling
but
there
no
fear
of
that
i
fancy
i
never
expect
to
tell
that
story
again
to
anybody
i
should
have
told
him
only
somehow
it
worried
me
for
three
years
and
though
i
was
deadly
afraid
of
ridicule
i
finally
made
up
my
mind
that
science
ought
to
have
a
hack
at
it
when
i
was
in
new
york
last
winter
i
summoned
up
courage
and
wrote
professor
farrago
he
came
to
see
me
at
the
holland
house
that
same
evening
i
told
him
as
much
as
i
ever
shall
tell
anybody
that
is
all
mr
gilland
for
a
long
time
i
sat
silent
musing
over
the
strange
words
after
a
while
i
asked
him
whether
professor
farrago
was
supplied
with
provisions
and
he
said
he
was
that
a
great
store
of
staples
and
tins
of
concentrated
rations
had
been
carried
in
as
far
as
little
sprite
lake
that
professor
farrago
was
now
there
alone
having
insisted
upon
dismissing
all
those
he
had
employed
there
was
no
practical
use
for
a
guide
added
rowan
because
no
cracker
no
indian
and
no
guide
knows
the
region
beyond
the
seminole
country
i
rose
thanking
him
and
offering
my
hand
he
took
it
and
shook
it
in
manly
fashion
saying
i
consider
professor
farrago
a
very
brave
man
i
may
say
the
same
of
any
man
who
volunteers
to
accompany
him
gilland
i
most
earnestly
wish
for
your
success
professor
farrago
left
this
letter
for
you
and
that
was
all
i
climbed
back
into
the
rickety
carriage
carrying
my
unopened
letter
the
negro
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
whistled
and
the
horses
trotted
inland
over
a
fine
shell
road
which
was
to
lead
us
across
verbena
junction
to
citron
city
half
an
hour
later
we
crossed
the
tracks
at
verbena
and
turned
into
a
broad
marl
road
this
aroused
me
from
my
deep
and
speculative
reverie
and
after
a
few
moments
i
asked
miss
barrison
indulgence
and
read
the
letter
from
professor
farrago
which
rowan
had
given
me
dear
gilland
you
now
know
all
i
dared
not
write
fearing
to
bring
a
swarm
of
explorers
about
my
ears
in
case
the
letter
was
lost
and
found
by
unscrupulous
meddlers
if
you
still
are
willing
to
volunteer
knowing
all
that
i
know
join
me
as
soon
as
possible
if
family
considerations
deter
you
from
taking
what
perhaps
is
an
insane
risk
i
shall
not
expect
you
to
join
me
in
that
event
return
to
new
york
immediately
and
send
kingsley
yours
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
him
i
exclaimed
irritably
take
any
chances
kingsley
does
miss
barrison
looked
up
in
surprise
miss
barrison
i
said
plunging
into
the
subject
headfirst
extremely
sorry
but
i
have
news
that
forces
me
to
believe
the
journey
too
dangerous
for
you
to
attempt
so
i
think
that
it
would
be
much
better
the
consternation
in
her
pretty
face
checked
me
i
awfully
sorry
i
muttered
appalled
by
her
silence
but
but
you
engaged
me
i
know
it
i
should
not
have
done
it
i
only
but
you
did
engage
me
did
you
i
believe
that
i
did
er
oh
of
course
but
a
verbal
contract
is
binding
between
honorable
people
is
it
mr
gilland
yes
but
and
ours
was
a
verbal
contract
and
in
consideration
you
paid
me
my
first
week
salary
and
i
bought
and
a
short
skirt
and
three
changes
of
and
and
i
know
i
know
i
groaned
but
i
fix
all
that
you
ca
if
you
break
your
contract
why
not
because
she
said
flushing
up
i
should
not
accept
you
do
understand
really
i
do
you
are
going
into
a
dangerous
country
and
you
afraid
i
be
frightened
it
something
like
that
tell
me
what
are
the
dangers
alligators
big
bitey
snakes
oh
you
said
all
that
before
seminoles
and
that
too
what
else
is
there
did
the
young
man
in
the
tell
you
of
something
worse
yes
much
worse
something
so
dreadfully
horrible
that
what
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
miss
barrison
i
said
striving
to
appear
shocked
it
would
not
make
any
difference
anyway
she
observed
calmly
not
afraid
of
anything
in
the
world
yes
you
are
i
said
listen
to
me
i
be
awfully
glad
to
have
you
go
i
i
really
had
no
idea
how
i
miss
you
miss
such
pleasant
companionship
but
it
is
not
possible
the
recollection
of
professor
farrago
aversion
suddenly
returned
no
no
i
said
it
ca
be
done
i
most
unhappy
over
this
mistake
of
mine
please
do
look
as
though
you
were
ready
to
cry
do
discharge
me
gilland
she
said
i
a
brute
to
do
it
but
i
must
i
was
a
bigger
brute
to
engage
you
but
i
did
do
please
do
look
at
me
that
way
miss
barrison
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
and
i
ca
endure
it
if
you
only
knew
what
i
had
been
through
you
would
send
me
away
she
said
in
a
low
voice
it
took
my
last
penny
to
clothe
myself
and
pay
for
the
last
lesson
at
the
college
of
stenography
i
i
lived
on
almost
nothing
for
weeks
every
respectable
place
was
filled
i
walked
and
walked
and
walked
and
nobody
wanted
me
they
all
required
people
with
experience
and
how
can
i
have
experience
until
i
begin
gilland
i
was
perfectly
desperate
when
i
went
to
see
you
knowing
that
you
had
advertised
for
a
man
the
slightest
break
in
her
clear
voice
scared
me
i
not
going
to
cry
she
said
striving
to
smile
if
i
must
go
i
will
go
i
i
did
mean
to
say
all
this
but
but
i
been
so
so
discouraged
and
you
were
not
very
cross
with
me
smitten
with
remorse
i
picked
up
her
hand
and
fell
to
patting
it
violently
trying
to
think
of
something
to
say
the
exercise
did
not
appear
to
stimulate
my
wits
then
then
i
to
go
with
you
she
asked
i
will
see
i
said
weakly
but
i
fear
there
trouble
ahead
for
this
expedition
i
fear
there
is
she
agreed
in
a
cheerful
voice
you
have
a
rifle
and
a
cage
in
your
luggage
are
you
going
to
trap
indians
and
have
me
report
their
language
no
i
not
going
to
trap
indians
i
said
sharply
they
may
trap
us
but
that
a
detail
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
is
this
professor
farrago
detests
unmarried
women
and
i
forgot
it
when
i
engaged
you
oh
is
that
all
she
asked
laughing
not
all
but
enough
to
cost
me
my
position
how
absurd
why
there
are
millions
of
things
we
might
do
millions
what
one
of
them
i
inquired
why
we
might
pretend
to
be
married
her
frank
and
absolutely
innocent
delight
in
this
suggestion
was
refreshing
but
troubling
we
would
have
to
be
demonstrative
to
make
that
story
go
i
said
why
people
are
not
demonstrative
in
public
she
retorted
turning
a
trifle
pink
no
but
in
private
i
think
there
is
no
necessity
for
carrying
a
pleasantry
into
our
private
life
she
said
in
a
perfectly
amiable
voice
anyway
if
professor
farrago
feelings
are
to
be
spared
no
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
a
mere
girl
could
be
too
great
she
added
gayly
i
will
wear
men
clothes
if
you
wish
you
may
have
to
anyhow
in
the
jungle
i
said
and
as
it
not
an
uncommon
thing
these
days
nobody
would
ever
take
you
for
anything
except
what
you
are
a
very
wilful
and
plucky
and
persistent
and
and
what
mr
gilland
and
attractive
i
muttered
thank
you
mr
gilland
you
welcome
i
snapped
the
near
whistle
of
a
locomotive
warned
us
and
i
rose
in
the
carriage
looking
out
across
the
that
is
probably
our
train
observed
the
pretty
stenographer
train
yes
is
it
then
you
insist
ah
no
gilland
i
only
trust
implicitly
in
my
employer
we
wait
till
we
get
to
citron
city
i
said
weakly
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
discuss
the
situation
wo
it
yes
indeed
she
said
smiling
but
she
knew
and
i
already
feared
that
the
situation
no
longer
admitted
of
discussion
in
a
few
moments
more
we
emerged
without
warning
from
the
into
the
single
white
street
of
citron
city
where
hung
heavy
with
bloom
and
magnolias
already
set
with
perfumed
candelabra
spread
soft
checkered
shadows
over
the
marl
the
train
lay
at
the
station
oceans
of
heavy
black
smoke
lazily
flowing
from
the
locomotive
negroes
were
hoisting
empty
aboard
the
through
the
door
of
which
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
steel
cage
and
remaining
paraphernalia
all
securely
crated
telegram
hyah
foh
mistuh
gilland
remarked
the
operator
lounging
at
his
window
as
we
descended
from
our
dusty
vehicle
he
had
not
addressed
himself
to
anybody
in
particular
but
i
said
that
i
was
gilland
and
he
produced
the
envelope
toted
in
from
okeechobee
he
inquired
listlessly
probably
it
signed
is
it
it
foh
yoh
suh
i
reckon
said
the
operator
handing
it
out
with
a
yawn
then
he
removed
his
hat
and
fanned
his
head
which
was
perfectly
bald
i
opened
the
yellow
envelope
get
me
a
good
dog
with
points
was
the
laconic
message
and
it
irritated
me
to
receive
such
idiotic
instructions
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
a
good
dog
where
the
mischief
could
i
find
a
dog
in
a
town
consisting
of
ten
houses
and
a
i
said
as
much
to
the
operator
who
smiled
wearily
and
replaced
his
hat
dawg
they
moh
in
citron
city
than
they
to
keep
them
busy
i
reckon
a
dollah
do
a
heap
foh
you
suh
could
you
get
me
a
dog
for
a
dollar
i
asked
one
with
points
points
i
sholy
can
suh
plenty
of
points
what
kind
of
dawg
do
yoh
requiah
suh
live
dawg
daid
dawg
the
locomotive
emitted
a
long
lazy
softly
modulated
and
thoroughly
southern
toot
i
handed
the
operator
a
silver
dollar
and
he
presently
emerged
from
his
office
and
slouched
off
up
the
street
while
i
walked
with
miss
barrison
to
the
station
platform
where
i
resumed
the
discussion
of
her
future
movements
you
are
very
young
to
take
such
a
risk
i
said
gravely
had
i
not
better
buy
your
ticket
back
to
new
york
the
train
meets
this
one
i
suppose
we
are
waiting
for
it
now
i
stopped
conscious
of
her
impatience
her
face
flushed
brightly
yes
i
think
it
best
i
have
embarrassed
you
too
long
already
do
say
that
i
muttered
i
i
shall
be
deadly
bored
without
you
i
am
not
an
entertainer
only
a
stenographer
she
said
curtly
please
get
me
my
ticket
mr
gilland
she
gazed
at
me
from
the
the
locomotive
tooted
two
drawling
toots
it
is
for
your
sake
i
said
avoiding
her
gaze
as
the
whistle
of
the
express
came
floating
out
of
the
blue
distance
she
did
not
answer
i
fished
out
my
watch
regarding
it
in
silence
listening
to
the
hum
of
the
approaching
train
which
ought
presently
to
bear
her
away
into
the
north
where
nothing
could
menace
her
except
the
brilliant
pitfalls
of
a
christian
civilization
but
i
stood
there
temporizing
unable
to
utter
a
word
as
her
train
shot
by
us
with
a
rush
slower
slower
and
finally
stopped
with
a
sigh
from
the
at
that
instant
the
appeared
carrying
a
dog
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
a
dog
from
the
four
corners
of
which
dangled
enormous
paws
he
yelped
when
he
beheld
me
miss
barrison
leaned
down
from
the
and
took
the
animal
into
her
arms
uttering
a
suppressed
exclamation
of
pity
as
she
lifted
him
you
have
your
hands
full
she
said
to
me
i
take
him
into
the
car
for
you
she
mounted
the
steps
i
followed
with
the
valises
striving
to
get
a
good
view
of
my
acquisition
over
her
shoulder
that
is
the
kind
of
dog
i
wanted
i
repeated
again
and
again
inspecting
the
animal
as
it
sprawled
on
the
floor
of
the
car
at
the
edge
of
miss
barrison
skirt
that
dog
is
all
voice
and
feet
and
emotion
what
makes
it
stick
up
its
paws
like
that
i
do
want
that
dog
and
i
not
going
to
identify
myself
with
it
where
the
operator
i
turned
towards
the
the
operator
bald
head
was
visible
on
a
line
with
the
sill
and
i
made
motions
at
him
he
bowed
with
courtly
grace
as
though
i
were
thanking
him
i
not
i
cried
shaking
my
head
i
wanted
a
dog
with
points
not
the
kind
of
points
that
stick
up
all
over
this
dog
take
him
away
the
operator
head
appeared
to
be
gliding
out
of
my
range
of
vision
then
the
windows
of
the
train
slid
past
faster
and
faster
a
melancholy
from
the
dog
a
jolt
and
i
turned
around
appalled
this
train
is
going
i
stammered
and
you
are
on
it
miss
barrison
sprang
up
and
started
towards
the
door
and
i
sped
after
her
i
can
jump
she
said
breathlessly
edging
out
to
the
platform
please
let
me
there
is
time
yet
if
you
only
would
hold
me
so
tight
a
few
moments
later
we
walked
slowly
back
together
through
the
car
and
took
seats
facing
one
another
between
us
sat
the
a
prey
to
melancholy
unutterable
xv
it
was
on
sunday
when
i
awoke
to
the
realization
that
i
had
quitted
civilization
and
was
afloat
on
an
unfamiliar
body
of
water
in
an
open
boat
containing
one
light
steel
cage
one
rifle
and
ammunition
one
stenographer
three
ounces
rosium
oxide
one
two
valises
a
playful
wave
slopped
over
the
bow
and
i
lost
count
but
the
pretty
stenographer
made
the
inventory
while
i
resumed
the
oars
and
the
dog
punctured
the
primeval
silence
with
staccato
yelps
a
few
minutes
later
everything
and
everybody
was
accounted
for
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
palms
waved
and
several
species
of
tuned
up
as
i
pulled
with
powerful
strokes
out
into
the
sunny
waters
of
little
sprite
lake
now
within
a
few
miles
of
my
journey
end
from
ponds
hidden
in
the
marshes
herons
rose
in
lazily
laborious
flight
flapping
low
across
the
water
high
in
the
cypress
ospreys
bent
crested
heads
to
watch
our
progress
alligators
lying
heavily
in
the
shoreward
sedge
slid
open
glassy
eyes
as
we
passed
even
the
make
eyes
at
you
i
said
resting
on
my
oars
we
were
on
terms
of
badinage
who
was
it
who
shed
crocodile
tears
at
the
prospect
of
shipping
me
north
she
inquired
speaking
of
tears
i
observed
somebody
is
likely
to
shed
a
number
when
professor
farrago
is
picked
up
pooh
she
said
and
snapped
her
pretty
fingers
and
i
resumed
the
oars
in
time
to
avoid
shipwreck
on
a
large
she
reclined
in
the
stern
serenely
occupied
with
the
view
now
and
then
caressing
the
discouraged
dog
now
and
then
patting
her
hair
where
the
wind
had
loosened
a
bright
strand
if
professor
farrago
did
expect
a
woman
stenographer
she
said
abruptly
why
did
he
instruct
you
to
bring
a
complete
outfit
of
woman
clothing
i
do
know
i
said
tartly
but
you
bought
them
are
they
for
a
young
woman
or
an
old
woman
i
do
know
i
sent
a
messenger
to
a
department
store
i
do
know
what
he
bought
did
you
look
them
over
no
why
i
should
have
been
no
wiser
i
fancy
they
all
right
because
the
bill
was
eighteen
hundred
dollars
the
pretty
stenographer
sat
up
abruptly
is
that
much
i
asked
uneasily
i
always
heard
women
clothing
was
expensive
was
it
enough
i
told
the
boy
to
order
the
best
professor
farrago
always
requires
the
very
best
scientific
instruments
and
i
listed
the
clothes
as
scientific
accessories
that
being
the
object
of
this
expedition
are
you
laughing
at
when
it
pleased
her
to
recover
her
gravity
she
announced
her
desire
to
inspect
and
repack
the
clothing
but
i
refused
they
for
professor
farrago
i
said
i
do
know
what
he
wants
of
them
i
do
suppose
he
intends
to
wear
and
caper
about
the
jungle
but
they
his
i
got
them
because
he
told
me
to
i
bought
a
cage
too
to
fit
myself
but
i
do
suppose
he
means
to
put
me
in
it
perhaps
i
added
he
may
invite
you
into
it
let
me
refold
the
gowns
she
pleaded
persuasively
what
does
a
clumsy
man
know
about
packing
such
clothing
as
that
if
you
do
they
be
ruined
it
a
shame
to
drag
those
boxes
about
through
mud
and
water
so
we
made
a
landing
and
lifted
out
and
unlocked
the
boxes
all
i
could
see
inside
were
mounds
of
lace
and
ribbons
and
with
a
vague
idea
that
miss
barrison
needed
no
assistance
i
returned
to
the
boat
and
sat
down
to
smoke
until
she
was
ready
when
she
summoned
me
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
bright
those
are
certainly
the
most
beautiful
things
she
said
softly
why
it
is
like
a
bride
trousseau
absolutely
complete
all
except
the
bridal
gown
is
there
a
dress
there
i
exclaimed
in
alarm
no
not
a
i
shrieked
he
does
want
women
he
a
bachelor
good
heavens
i
done
it
this
time
but
but
who
is
to
wear
them
she
asked
how
do
i
know
i
do
know
anything
i
can
only
presume
that
he
does
intend
to
open
a
department
store
in
the
everglades
and
if
any
lady
is
to
wear
garments
in
his
vicinity
i
assume
that
those
garments
are
to
be
anything
except
diaphanous
please
take
your
seat
in
the
boat
miss
barrison
i
want
to
row
and
think
i
had
had
my
fill
of
exercise
and
thought
when
about
four
in
the
afternoon
miss
barrison
directed
my
attention
to
a
point
of
palms
jutting
out
into
the
water
about
a
mile
to
the
southward
that
farrago
i
exclaimed
catching
sight
of
a
united
states
flag
floating
majestically
from
a
give
me
the
megaphone
if
you
please
she
handed
me
the
instrument
i
hailed
the
shore
and
presently
a
man
appeared
under
the
palms
at
the
water
edge
hello
i
roared
trying
to
inject
cheerfulness
into
the
hollow
bellow
how
are
you
professor
the
answer
came
distinctly
across
the
water
is
that
with
you
my
lips
were
buried
in
the
megaphone
i
strove
to
speak
i
only
produced
a
ghastly
chuckling
sound
of
course
you
expect
to
tell
the
truth
observed
the
pretty
stenographer
quietly
i
removed
my
lips
from
the
megaphone
and
looked
around
at
her
she
returned
my
gaze
with
a
disturbing
smile
i
want
to
mitigate
the
blow
i
said
hoarsely
tell
me
how
i
sure
i
do
know
she
said
sweetly
well
do
i
fairly
barked
and
seizing
the
megaphone
again
i
set
it
to
my
lips
and
roared
my
fiancée
good
gracious
exclaimed
miss
barrison
in
consternation
i
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
the
truth
do
do
that
or
you
upset
us
i
snapped
i
telling
the
truth
i
engaged
myself
to
you
i
did
it
mentally
before
i
bellowed
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
engagements
mean
i
said
picking
up
the
oars
and
digging
them
deep
in
the
blue
water
she
assented
uncertainly
a
few
minutes
more
of
vigorous
rowing
brought
us
to
a
muddy
landing
under
a
cluster
of
tall
palmettos
where
a
gasoline
launch
lay
professor
farrago
came
down
to
the
shore
as
i
landed
and
i
walked
ahead
to
meet
him
he
was
the
maddest
man
i
ever
saw
but
i
was
his
match
for
i
was
desperate
what
the
devil
he
began
under
his
breath
nonsense
i
said
deliberately
an
engaged
woman
is
practically
married
already
because
marriages
are
made
in
heaven
good
lord
he
gasped
are
you
mad
gilland
i
sent
for
a
stenographer
miss
barrison
is
a
stenographer
i
said
calmly
and
before
he
could
recover
i
had
presented
him
and
left
them
face
to
face
washing
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
unloading
the
boat
and
carrying
the
luggage
up
under
the
palms
i
heard
her
saying
no
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
snakes
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
begin
my
duties
and
he
gilland
is
a
young
man
who
er
lacks
practical
experience
and
she
gilland
has
been
most
thoughtful
for
my
comfort
the
journey
has
been
perfectly
heavenly
and
he
clumsily
ahem
the
er
celestial
aspect
of
your
journey
has
er
doubtless
been
colored
by
er
the
prospect
of
your
er
approaching
nuptials
she
hastily
oh
i
do
not
think
so
professor
idiot
i
muttered
dragging
the
dog
to
the
shore
where
his
yelps
brought
the
professor
hurrying
is
the
dog
he
inquired
adjusting
his
spectacles
that
the
dog
i
said
he
full
of
points
you
see
oh
mused
the
professor
i
thought
he
was
full
of
he
hesitated
inspecting
the
animal
who
nose
to
the
ground
stood
investigating
a
smell
of
some
sort
see
i
said
with
enthusiasm
he
found
a
scent
he
trailing
it
already
now
he
rolling
on
it
he
rolling
on
one
of
our
concentrated
food
lozenges
said
the
professor
dryly
tie
him
up
gilland
and
ask
gilland
to
come
up
to
camp
your
room
is
ready
rooms
i
corrected
she
is
gilland
yet
i
added
with
a
forced
smile
but
you
practically
married
observed
the
professor
as
you
pointed
out
to
me
and
if
she
practically
gilland
why
not
say
so
do
all
the
same
i
snarled
but
marriages
are
made
in
i
cast
a
desperate
eye
upon
him
from
that
moment
whenever
we
were
alone
together
he
made
a
target
of
me
i
never
had
supposed
him
humorously
vindictive
he
was
and
his
apparently
innocent
mistakes
almost
turned
my
hair
gray
but
to
miss
barrison
he
was
kind
and
courteous
and
for
a
time
observing
him
i
could
never
detect
the
slightest
symptom
of
dislike
for
her
sex
a
failing
which
common
rumor
had
always
credited
him
with
to
the
verge
of
absolute
rudeness
on
the
contrary
it
was
perfectly
plain
to
anybody
that
he
liked
her
there
was
in
his
manner
towards
her
a
mixture
of
business
formality
and
the
deferential
attitude
of
a
gentleman
we
were
seated
just
before
sunset
outside
of
the
hut
built
of
palmetto
logs
when
professor
farrago
addressing
us
both
began
the
explanation
of
our
future
duties
miss
barrison
it
appeared
was
to
note
everything
said
by
himself
making
several
shorthand
copies
by
evening
in
other
words
she
was
to
report
every
scrap
of
conversation
she
heard
while
in
the
everglades
and
she
nodded
intelligently
as
he
finished
and
drew
pad
and
pencil
from
the
pocket
of
her
jotting
down
his
instructions
as
a
beginning
i
could
see
that
he
was
pleased
the
reason
i
do
this
he
said
is
because
i
do
not
wish
to
hide
anything
that
transpires
while
we
are
on
this
expedition
only
the
most
scrupulously
minute
record
can
satisfy
me
no
details
are
too
small
to
merit
record
i
demand
and
i
court
from
my
and
from
the
public
the
fullest
investigation
he
smiled
slightly
turning
towards
me
you
know
gilland
how
dangerous
to
the
reputation
of
a
scientific
man
is
any
line
of
investigation
into
the
unusual
if
a
man
once
is
even
suspected
of
charlatanism
of
sensationalism
of
turning
his
attention
to
any
phenomena
not
strictly
within
the
proper
pale
of
scientific
investigation
that
man
is
doomed
to
ridicule
his
profession
disowns
him
he
becomes
a
man
without
honor
without
authority
is
it
not
so
yes
i
said
therefore
he
resumed
thoughtfully
as
i
do
most
firmly
believe
in
the
course
i
am
now
pursuing
whether
i
succeed
or
fail
i
desire
a
true
and
minute
record
made
hiding
nothing
of
what
may
be
said
or
done
a
stenographer
alone
can
give
this
to
the
world
while
i
can
only
supplement
it
with
a
description
of
events
if
i
live
to
transcribe
them
sunk
in
profound
reverie
he
sat
there
silent
under
the
great
smooth
a
venerable
figure
in
his
yellow
and
carpet
slippers
seated
side
by
side
we
waited
a
trifle
awed
i
could
hear
the
soft
breathing
of
the
pretty
stenographer
beside
me
first
of
all
said
professor
farrago
looking
up
i
must
be
able
to
trust
those
who
are
here
to
aid
me
i
i
will
be
faithful
said
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
i
do
not
doubt
you
my
child
he
said
nor
you
gilland
and
so
i
am
going
to
tell
you
this
much
now
more
i
hope
later
and
he
sat
up
straight
lifting
an
impressive
forefinger
rowan
lately
an
officer
of
our
coast
survey
wrote
me
a
letter
from
the
holland
house
in
new
york
a
letter
so
strange
that
on
reading
it
i
immediately
repaired
to
his
hotel
where
for
hours
we
talked
together
the
result
of
that
conference
is
this
expedition
i
have
now
been
here
two
months
and
i
am
satisfied
of
certain
facts
first
there
do
exist
in
this
unexplored
wilderness
certain
forms
of
life
which
are
solid
and
palpable
but
transparent
and
practically
invisible
second
these
living
creatures
belong
to
the
animal
kingdom
are
vertebrates
possess
powers
of
locomotion
but
whether
that
of
flight
i
am
not
certain
third
they
appear
to
possess
such
senses
as
we
enjoy
smell
touch
sight
hearing
and
no
doubt
the
sense
of
taste
fourth
their
skin
is
smooth
to
the
touch
and
the
temperature
of
the
epidermis
appears
to
approximate
that
of
a
normal
human
being
fifth
and
last
whether
bipeds
or
quadrupeds
i
do
not
know
though
all
evidence
appears
to
confirm
my
theory
that
they
walk
erect
one
pair
of
their
limbs
appear
to
terminate
in
a
sort
of
foot
like
a
delicately
shaped
human
foot
except
that
there
appear
to
be
no
toes
the
other
pair
of
limbs
terminate
in
something
that
from
the
single
instance
i
experienced
seemed
to
resemble
soft
but
firm
antennæ
or
perhaps
digitated
palpi
feelers
i
blurted
out
i
do
know
but
i
think
so
once
when
i
was
standing
in
the
forest
perfectly
aware
that
creatures
i
could
not
see
had
stealthily
surrounded
me
the
tension
was
brought
to
a
crisis
when
over
my
face
from
cheek
to
chin
stole
a
soft
something
brushing
the
skin
as
delicately
as
a
child
fingers
might
brush
it
good
lord
i
breathed
a
smile
crept
into
his
eyes
a
test
for
nerves
you
think
gilland
i
agree
with
you
nobody
fears
what
anybody
can
see
there
came
the
slightest
movement
beside
me
are
you
trembling
i
asked
turning
i
was
writing
she
replied
steadily
did
my
elbow
touch
you
said
professor
farrago
i
fear
i
forgot
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
choice
of
a
stenographer
mr
gilland
a
rosy
light
stole
over
her
pale
face
am
i
to
record
that
too
she
asked
raising
her
blue
eyes
certainly
he
replied
gravely
but
professor
i
began
a
prey
to
increasing
excitement
do
you
propose
to
attempt
the
capture
of
one
of
these
animals
that
is
what
the
cage
is
for
he
said
i
supposed
you
had
guessed
that
i
had
murmured
the
pretty
stenographer
i
do
not
doubt
it
said
professor
farrago
gravely
what
are
the
chemicals
for
and
the
tank
and
hose
attachment
think
mr
gilland
i
ca
i
almost
stunned
by
what
you
tell
me
he
laughed
the
rosium
oxide
and
salts
of
strontium
are
to
be
dumped
into
the
tank
together
they
effervesce
of
course
of
course
i
muttered
and
i
can
throw
a
spray
over
any
object
by
the
hose
attachment
ca
i
yes
well
i
tried
it
on
a
transparent
and
it
became
perfectly
visible
and
of
a
beautiful
and
i
tried
it
on
and
on
glass
and
on
pure
gelatine
and
all
became
suffused
with
a
delicate
pink
glow
which
lasted
for
hours
or
minutes
according
to
the
substance
now
you
understand
do
you
yes
you
want
to
see
what
sort
of
creature
you
have
to
deal
with
exactly
so
when
i
trapped
it
i
am
going
to
spray
it
he
turned
half
humorously
towards
the
stenographer
i
fancy
you
understood
long
before
gilland
did
i
do
think
so
she
said
with
a
sidelong
lifting
of
the
heavy
lashes
and
i
caught
the
color
of
her
eyes
for
a
second
you
see
how
miss
barrison
spares
your
feelings
observed
professor
farrago
dryly
she
owes
you
little
gratitude
for
bringing
her
here
yet
she
proves
a
generous
victim
oh
i
am
very
grateful
for
this
rarest
of
chances
she
said
shyly
to
be
among
the
first
in
the
world
to
discover
such
wonders
ought
to
make
me
very
grateful
to
the
man
who
gave
me
the
opportunity
do
you
mean
mr
gilland
asked
the
professor
laughing
i
had
never
before
seen
professor
farrago
laugh
such
a
laugh
i
had
never
suspected
him
of
harboring
even
an
embryo
of
the
social
graces
dry
as
dust
sapless
as
steel
precise
as
the
magnetic
needle
he
had
hitherto
been
to
me
the
mummified
embodiment
of
science
militant
now
in
the
guise
of
a
perfectly
human
and
genial
old
gentleman
i
scarcely
recognized
my
superior
of
the
bronx
park
society
and
as
a
he
was
a
miserable
failure
heavens
i
thought
to
myself
am
i
becoming
jealous
of
my
revered
professor
social
success
with
a
stray
stenographer
i
felt
mean
and
i
probably
looked
it
and
i
was
glad
that
telepathy
did
not
permit
miss
barrison
to
record
my
secret
and
unworthy
ruminations
the
professor
was
saying
these
transparent
creatures
break
off
berries
and
fruits
and
branches
i
have
seen
a
flower
too
plucked
from
its
stem
by
invisible
digits
and
borne
swiftly
through
the
forest
only
the
flower
visible
apparently
speeding
through
the
air
and
out
of
sight
among
the
thickets
i
have
found
the
footprints
that
i
described
to
you
usually
on
the
edge
of
a
stream
or
in
the
soft
loam
along
some
forest
lake
or
lost
lagoon
again
and
again
i
have
been
conscious
in
the
forest
that
unseen
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
that
unseen
shapes
were
following
me
never
but
that
one
time
did
these
invisible
creatures
close
in
around
me
and
venture
to
touch
me
they
may
be
weak
their
structure
may
be
frail
and
they
may
be
incapable
of
violence
or
harm
but
the
depth
of
the
footprints
indicates
a
weight
of
at
least
one
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
and
it
certainly
requires
some
muscular
strength
to
break
off
a
branch
of
wild
guavas
he
bent
his
noble
head
thoughtfully
regarding
the
design
on
his
slippers
what
was
the
rifle
for
i
asked
defence
not
aggression
he
said
simply
and
the
camera
a
camera
record
is
necessary
in
these
days
of
bad
artists
i
hesitated
glancing
at
miss
barrison
she
was
still
writing
her
pretty
head
bent
over
the
pad
in
her
lap
and
the
clothing
i
asked
carelessly
did
you
get
it
he
demanded
of
course
i
glanced
at
miss
barrison
there
no
use
writing
down
everything
is
there
everything
must
be
recorded
said
professor
farrago
inflexibly
what
clothing
did
you
buy
i
forgot
the
gown
i
said
getting
red
about
the
ears
forgot
the
gown
he
repeated
yes
one
kind
of
gown
the
day
kind
i
i
got
the
other
kind
he
was
annoyed
so
was
i
after
a
moment
he
got
up
and
crossing
to
the
log
cabin
opened
one
of
the
boxes
of
apparel
is
it
what
you
wanted
i
inquired
i
presume
so
he
replied
visibly
perplexed
it
the
best
to
be
had
said
i
that
quite
right
he
said
musingly
we
use
only
the
best
of
everything
at
bronx
park
it
is
traditional
with
us
you
know
curiosity
pushed
me
well
what
on
earth
is
it
for
i
broke
out
he
looked
at
me
gravely
over
the
tops
of
his
spectacles
a
striking
and
inspiring
figure
in
his
yellow
flannel
and
slippers
i
shall
tell
you
some
day
perhaps
he
said
mildly
miss
barrison
gilland
you
will
find
extra
blankets
on
your
bunk
what
i
cried
bunks
he
said
and
shut
the
door
xvi
there
is
something
weird
about
this
whole
proceeding
i
observed
to
the
pretty
stenographer
next
morning
these
pies
will
be
weird
if
you
do
stop
talking
to
me
she
said
opening
the
doors
of
professor
farrago
portable
and
peeping
in
at
the
fragrant
pastry
the
professor
had
gone
off
somewhere
into
the
woods
early
that
morning
as
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
talking
to
himself
the
services
of
miss
barrison
were
not
required
before
he
started
however
he
came
to
her
with
a
request
for
a
dozen
pies
the
construction
of
which
he
asked
if
she
understood
she
had
been
to
in
more
prosperous
days
and
she
mentioned
it
so
at
his
earnest
solicitation
she
undertook
to
bake
for
him
twelve
and
she
was
now
attempting
it
assisted
by
advice
from
me
are
they
burned
i
asked
sniffing
the
air
no
they
are
not
burned
gilland
but
my
finger
is
she
retorted
stepping
back
to
examine
the
damage
i
offered
sympathy
and
but
she
would
have
none
of
my
offerings
and
presently
returned
to
her
pies
we
ca
eat
all
that
pastry
i
protested
professor
farrago
said
they
were
not
for
us
to
eat
she
said
dusting
each
pie
with
powdered
sugar
well
what
are
they
for
the
dog
or
are
they
simply
objets
to
adorn
the
shanty
you
annoy
me
she
said
the
pies
annoy
me
wo
you
tell
me
what
they
for
i
have
a
pretty
fair
idea
what
they
for
she
observed
tossing
her
head
have
you
no
what
these
pies
are
for
bait
to
bait
hooks
with
i
exclaimed
hooks
no
you
silly
man
they
for
baiting
the
cage
he
means
to
trap
these
transparent
creatures
in
a
cage
baited
with
pie
she
laughed
scornfully
inserted
the
burned
tip
of
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
stood
looking
at
me
defiantly
like
a
flushed
and
you
think
you
teasing
me
she
said
but
you
do
not
realize
what
a
singularly
young
man
you
are
i
stopped
laughing
how
did
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
pies
were
to
be
used
for
such
a
purpose
i
asked
i
deduce
she
observed
with
an
airy
wave
of
her
disengaged
hand
your
deductions
are
weird
like
everything
else
in
this
vicinity
pies
to
catch
invisible
monsters
pooh
you
not
particularly
complimentary
are
you
she
said
not
particularly
but
i
could
be
with
you
for
my
inspiration
i
could
even
be
enthusiastic
about
my
pies
no
about
your
eyes
you
are
very
frivolous
for
a
scientist
she
said
scornfully
please
subdue
your
enthusiasm
and
bring
me
some
wood
this
fire
is
almost
out
when
i
had
brought
the
wood
she
presented
me
with
a
pail
of
hot
water
and
pointed
at
the
dishes
on
the
never
i
cried
revolted
then
i
suppose
i
must
do
them
she
looked
pensively
at
her
scorched
and
pursing
up
her
red
lips
blew
a
gentle
breath
to
cool
it
i
do
the
dishes
i
said
splashing
and
slushing
the
cups
and
saucers
about
in
the
hot
water
i
reflected
upon
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
the
dog
stupefied
by
unwonted
abundance
of
food
lay
in
the
sunshine
sleeping
the
sleep
of
repletion
the
pretty
stenographer
all
rosy
from
her
culinary
exertions
was
removing
the
pies
and
setting
them
in
neat
rows
to
cool
there
she
said
with
a
sigh
now
i
will
dry
the
dishes
for
you
you
did
mention
the
fact
when
you
engaged
me
that
i
was
also
expected
to
do
general
housework
i
did
engage
you
i
said
maliciously
you
engaged
me
you
know
she
regarded
me
disdainfully
nose
uptilted
how
thoroughly
disagreeable
you
can
be
she
said
dry
your
own
dishes
i
going
for
a
stroll
may
i
join
you
may
i
shall
go
so
far
that
you
can
not
possibly
discover
me
i
watched
her
forestward
progress
she
sauntered
for
about
thirty
yards
along
the
lake
and
presently
sat
down
in
plain
sight
under
a
huge
a
few
moments
later
i
had
completed
my
task
as
general
and
i
cast
about
for
something
to
occupy
me
first
i
approached
and
politely
caressed
the
satiated
dog
he
woke
up
regarded
me
with
dully
meditative
eyes
yawned
and
went
to
sleep
again
never
a
flop
of
tail
to
indicate
gratitude
for
blandishments
never
the
faintest
symptom
of
canine
appreciation
chilled
by
my
reception
i
moused
about
for
a
while
poking
into
boxes
and
bundles
then
raised
my
head
and
inspected
the
landscape
through
the
vista
of
trees
the
pink
of
the
pretty
stenographer
glimmered
like
a
rose
blooming
in
the
wilderness
from
whatever
point
i
viewed
the
prospect
that
pink
spot
seemed
to
intrude
i
turned
my
back
and
examined
the
jungle
but
there
it
was
repeated
in
a
hundred
pink
blossoms
among
the
massed
thickets
i
looked
up
into
the
where
pink
mosses
spotted
the
palms
i
looked
out
over
the
lake
and
i
saw
it
in
my
mind
eye
pinker
than
ever
it
was
certainly
a
case
of
i
go
for
a
stroll
too
it
a
free
country
i
muttered
after
i
had
strolled
in
a
complete
circle
i
found
myself
within
three
feet
of
a
pink
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
had
no
inten
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
she
said
amiably
how
is
your
finger
i
asked
she
held
it
up
i
took
it
gingerly
it
was
smooth
and
faintly
rosy
at
the
tip
does
it
hurt
i
inquired
dreadfully
your
hands
feel
so
cool
after
a
silence
she
said
thank
you
that
has
cooled
the
burning
i
am
determined
said
i
to
expel
the
fire
from
your
finger
if
it
takes
hours
and
hours
and
i
seated
myself
with
that
intention
for
a
while
she
talked
making
innocent
observations
concerning
the
tropical
foliage
surrounding
us
then
silence
crept
in
between
us
accentuated
by
the
brooding
stillness
of
the
forest
i
am
afraid
your
hands
are
growing
tired
she
said
considerately
i
denied
it
through
the
vista
of
palms
we
could
see
the
lake
blue
as
a
violet
sparkling
with
silvery
sunshine
in
the
intense
quiet
the
splash
of
leaping
mullet
sounded
distinctly
once
a
tall
crane
stalked
into
view
among
the
sedges
once
an
unseen
alligator
shook
the
silence
with
his
deep
hollow
roaring
then
the
stillness
of
the
wilderness
grew
more
intense
we
had
been
sitting
there
for
a
long
while
without
exchanging
a
word
dreamily
watching
the
ripple
of
the
azure
water
when
all
at
once
there
came
a
scurrying
patter
of
feet
through
the
forest
and
looking
up
i
beheld
the
tail
between
his
legs
bearing
down
on
us
at
lightning
speed
i
rose
instantly
what
is
the
matter
with
the
dog
cried
the
pretty
stenographer
is
he
going
mad
mr
gilland
something
has
scared
him
i
exclaimed
as
the
dog
eyes
like
lighted
candles
rushed
frantically
between
my
legs
and
buried
his
head
in
miss
barrison
lap
poor
doggy
she
said
smoothing
the
collapsed
pup
poor
little
beast
did
anything
scare
him
tell
aunty
all
about
it
when
a
dog
flees
he
a
badly
frightened
creature
i
instinctively
started
back
towards
the
camp
whence
the
beast
had
fled
and
before
i
had
taken
a
dozen
steps
miss
barrison
was
beside
me
carrying
the
dog
in
her
arms
i
an
idea
she
said
under
her
breath
what
i
asked
keeping
my
eyes
on
the
camp
it
this
i
wager
that
we
find
those
pies
gone
pies
gone
i
repeated
perplexed
what
makes
you
think
they
gone
she
exclaimed
look
i
gaped
stupidly
at
the
rough
pine
table
where
the
pies
had
stood
in
three
neat
rows
of
four
each
and
then
in
a
moment
the
purport
of
this
robbery
flashed
upon
my
senses
the
transparent
creatures
i
gasped
hush
she
whispered
clinging
to
the
trembling
dog
in
her
arms
i
listened
i
could
hear
nothing
see
nothing
yet
slowly
i
became
convinced
of
the
presence
of
something
unseen
something
in
the
forest
close
by
watching
us
out
of
invisible
eyes
a
chill
settling
along
my
spine
crept
upward
to
my
scalp
until
every
separate
hair
wiggled
to
the
roots
miss
barrison
was
pale
but
perfectly
calm
and
let
us
go
i
said
as
steadily
as
i
could
very
well
she
replied
i
held
the
door
open
she
entered
with
the
dog
i
followed
closing
and
barring
the
door
and
then
took
my
station
at
the
window
rifle
in
hand
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
forest
miss
barrison
laid
the
dog
on
the
floor
and
quietly
picked
up
her
pad
and
pencil
presently
she
was
deep
in
a
report
of
the
phenomena
her
pencil
flying
leaf
after
leaf
from
the
pad
fluttering
to
the
floor
nor
did
i
at
the
window
change
my
position
of
scared
alertness
until
i
was
aware
of
her
hand
gently
touching
my
elbow
to
attract
my
attention
and
her
soft
voice
at
my
ear
you
do
suppose
by
any
chance
that
the
dog
ate
those
pies
i
collected
my
tumultuous
thoughts
and
turned
to
stare
at
the
dog
twelve
pies
twelve
inches
each
in
diameter
she
reflected
musingly
one
dog
twenty
inches
in
diameter
how
many
times
will
the
pies
go
into
the
dog
let
me
see
she
made
a
few
figures
on
her
pad
thought
awhile
produced
a
from
her
pocket
and
kneeling
down
measured
the
dog
no
she
said
looking
up
at
me
he
could
contain
them
inspired
by
her
coolness
and
perfect
composure
i
set
the
rifle
in
the
corner
and
opened
the
door
sunlight
fell
in
bars
through
the
quiet
woods
nothing
stirred
on
land
or
water
save
the
great
butterflies
that
fluttered
and
soared
and
floated
above
the
flowering
thickets
bordering
the
jungle
the
heat
became
intense
miss
barrison
went
to
her
room
to
change
her
gown
for
a
lighter
one
i
sat
down
under
a
eyes
and
ears
strained
for
any
sign
of
our
invisible
neighbors
when
she
emerged
in
the
lightest
and
filmiest
of
summer
gowns
she
brought
the
camera
with
her
and
for
a
while
we
took
pictures
of
each
other
until
we
had
used
up
all
but
one
film
desiring
to
possess
a
picture
of
miss
barrison
and
myself
seated
together
i
tied
a
string
to
the
and
attached
the
other
end
of
the
string
to
the
dog
who
had
resumed
his
interrupted
slumbers
at
my
whistle
he
jumped
up
nervously
snapping
the
lever
and
the
picture
was
taken
with
such
innocent
and
harmless
pastime
we
whiled
away
the
afternoon
she
made
twelve
more
i
mounted
guard
over
them
and
we
were
just
beginning
to
feel
a
trifle
uneasy
about
professor
farrago
when
he
appeared
tramping
sturdily
through
the
forest
green
umbrella
and
under
one
arm
and
under
the
other
and
his
breast
all
with
straps
from
which
dangled
and
an
inspiring
figure
indeed
the
embodied
symbol
of
science
indomitable
triumphant
we
hailed
him
with
three
guilty
cheers
the
dog
woke
up
with
a
perfunctory
bark
the
first
sound
i
had
heard
from
him
since
he
yelped
his
disapproval
of
me
on
the
lagoon
miss
barrison
produced
three
bowls
full
of
boiling
water
and
dropped
three
pellets
of
concentrated
into
them
while
i
prepared
coffee
and
in
a
few
moments
our
simple
dinner
was
ready
the
red
ants
had
been
dusted
from
the
biscuits
the
spiders
chased
off
the
baked
beans
the
scorpions
shaken
from
the
napkins
and
we
sat
down
at
the
rough
improvised
table
under
the
palms
the
professor
gave
us
a
brief
but
modest
account
of
his
short
tour
of
exploration
he
had
brought
back
a
new
species
of
orchid
several
undescribed
beetles
and
a
pocketful
of
coontie
seed
he
appeared
however
to
be
tired
and
singularly
depressed
and
presently
we
learned
why
it
seemed
that
he
had
gone
straight
to
that
section
of
the
forest
where
he
had
hitherto
always
found
signs
of
the
transparent
and
invisible
creatures
which
he
had
determined
to
capture
and
he
had
not
found
a
single
trace
of
them
it
alarms
me
he
said
gravely
if
they
have
deserted
this
region
it
might
take
a
lifetime
to
locate
them
again
in
this
wilderness
then
very
quietly
sinking
her
voice
instinctively
as
though
the
unseen
might
be
at
our
very
elbows
listening
miss
barrison
recounted
the
curious
adventure
which
had
befallen
the
dog
and
the
first
batch
of
with
visible
and
increasing
excitement
the
professor
listened
until
the
very
end
then
he
struck
the
table
with
clinched
fist
a
resounding
blow
which
set
the
concentrated
soup
dancing
in
the
bowls
and
scattered
the
biscuits
and
the
industrious
red
ants
in
every
direction
eureka
he
whispered
miss
barrison
your
deduction
was
not
only
perfectly
reasonable
but
brilliant
you
are
right
the
pies
are
for
that
very
purpose
i
conceived
the
idea
when
i
first
came
here
again
and
again
the
pies
that
my
guide
made
out
of
dried
apples
disappeared
in
a
most
astonishing
and
mysterious
manner
when
left
to
cool
at
length
i
determined
to
watch
them
every
second
and
did
so
with
the
result
that
late
one
afternoon
i
was
amazed
to
see
a
pie
slowly
rise
from
the
table
and
move
swiftly
away
through
the
air
about
four
feet
above
the
ground
finally
disappearing
into
a
tangle
of
jasmine
and
the
apparently
automatic
flight
of
that
pie
solved
the
problem
these
transparent
creatures
can
not
resist
that
delicacy
therefore
i
decided
to
bait
the
cage
for
them
this
very
night
look
what
the
matter
with
that
dog
the
dog
suddenly
bounded
into
the
air
alighted
on
all
fours
ears
eyes
and
muzzle
concentrated
on
a
point
directly
behind
us
good
gracious
the
pies
faltered
miss
barrison
half
rising
from
her
seat
but
the
dog
rushed
madly
into
her
skirts
scrambling
for
protection
and
she
fell
back
almost
into
my
arms
clasping
her
tightly
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
the
last
pie
was
snatched
from
the
table
before
my
eyes
and
i
saw
it
borne
swiftly
away
by
something
unseen
straight
into
the
deepening
shadows
of
the
forest
the
professor
was
singularly
calm
even
slightly
ironical
as
he
turned
to
me
saying
perhaps
if
you
relinquish
miss
barrison
she
may
be
able
to
free
herself
from
that
dog
i
did
so
immediately
and
she
deposited
the
cowering
dog
in
my
arms
her
face
had
suddenly
become
pink
i
passed
the
dog
on
to
professor
farrago
dumping
it
viciously
into
his
lap
a
proceeding
which
struck
me
as
resembling
a
pastime
of
extreme
youth
known
as
button
button
who
got
the
button
the
professor
examined
the
animal
gravely
feeling
its
pulse
counting
its
respirations
and
finally
inserting
a
tentative
finger
in
an
attempt
to
examine
its
tongue
the
dog
bit
him
ouch
it
a
clear
case
of
fright
he
said
gravely
i
wanted
a
dog
to
aid
me
in
trailing
these
remarkable
creatures
but
i
think
this
dog
of
yours
is
useless
gilland
it
given
us
warning
of
the
creatures
presence
twice
already
i
argued
poor
little
thing
said
miss
barrison
softly
i
do
know
why
but
i
love
that
dog
he
has
eyes
like
yours
gilland
exasperated
i
rose
from
the
table
he
got
eyes
like
holes
burned
in
a
blanket
i
said
and
if
ever
a
flicker
of
intelligence
lighted
them
i
have
failed
to
observe
it
the
professor
regarded
me
dreamily
we
ought
to
have
more
pies
he
observed
perhaps
if
you
carried
the
oven
into
the
shanty
certainly
said
miss
barrison
we
can
lock
the
door
while
i
make
twelve
more
pies
i
carried
the
portable
into
the
cabin
connected
the
patent
asbestos
and
lighted
the
fire
and
in
a
few
minutes
miss
barrison
sleeves
rolled
up
and
pink
apron
pinned
under
her
chin
was
busily
engaged
in
rolling
while
professor
farrago
measured
out
spices
and
set
the
dried
apples
to
soak
the
swift
southern
twilight
had
already
veiled
the
forest
as
i
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
to
smoke
a
cigar
and
promenade
a
bit
and
cogitate
a
last
trace
of
color
lingering
in
the
west
faded
out
as
i
looked
the
gray
glimmer
deepened
into
darkness
through
which
the
white
lake
vapors
floated
in
thin
wavering
strata
across
the
water
for
a
while
the
frog
symphony
dominated
all
other
sounds
then
lagoon
and
forest
and
cypress
branch
awoke
and
through
the
steadily
sustained
tumult
of
woodland
voices
i
could
hear
the
dry
bark
of
the
the
whistle
of
the
raccoon
ducks
softly
quacking
or
whimpering
as
they
prepared
for
sleep
among
the
reeds
the
soft
booming
of
bitterns
the
clattering
gossip
of
the
heronry
the
southern
whippoorwill
incessant
call
at
regular
intervals
the
howling
note
of
a
lone
heron
echoed
the
strident
screech
of
a
crane
the
horned
owl
savage
haunted
the
night
now
near
now
floating
from
infinite
distances
and
after
a
while
i
became
aware
of
a
nearer
sound
but
ceaseless
the
hum
of
thousands
of
lesser
living
creatures
blending
to
a
steady
monotone
then
the
theatrical
moon
came
up
through
filmy
draperies
of
waving
spanish
moss
thin
as
cobwebs
and
far
in
the
wilderness
a
cougar
fell
and
coughing
like
a
little
child
with
a
bad
cold
i
went
in
after
that
miss
barrison
was
sitting
before
the
oven
knees
gathered
in
her
clasped
hands
languidly
studying
the
fire
she
looked
up
as
i
appeared
opened
the
sniffed
the
aroma
and
resumed
her
attitude
of
contented
indifference
where
is
the
professor
i
asked
he
has
retired
he
been
talking
in
his
sleep
at
moments
better
take
it
down
that
what
you
here
for
i
observed
closing
and
holding
the
outside
door
ugh
there
a
chill
in
the
air
the
dew
is
pelting
down
from
the
pines
like
a
steady
fall
of
rain
you
will
get
fever
if
you
roam
about
at
night
she
said
mercy
your
coat
is
soaking
sit
here
by
the
fire
so
i
pulled
up
a
bench
and
sat
down
beside
her
like
the
traditional
spider
miss
muffitt
i
said
do
let
me
frighten
you
away
i
was
going
anyhow
please
do
why
she
demanded
reseating
herself
because
i
like
to
sit
beside
you
i
said
truthfully
your
avowal
is
startling
and
not
to
be
substantiated
by
facts
she
remarked
resting
her
chin
on
one
hand
and
gazing
into
the
fire
you
mean
because
i
went
for
a
stroll
by
moonlight
i
did
that
because
you
always
seem
to
make
fun
of
me
as
soon
as
the
professor
joins
us
make
fun
of
you
you
surely
do
expect
me
to
make
eyes
at
you
there
was
a
silence
i
toasted
my
shins
thoughtfully
how
is
your
burned
finger
i
asked
she
lifted
it
for
my
inspection
and
i
began
a
protracted
examination
what
would
you
prescribe
she
inquired
with
an
glance
at
the
professor
closed
door
i
do
know
perhaps
a
slight
but
firm
pressure
of
the
you
tried
that
this
afternoon
but
the
dog
interrupted
us
interrupted
besides
what
i
do
think
you
ought
to
she
said
sitting
there
before
the
oven
side
by
side
hand
innocently
clasped
in
hand
we
heard
the
drumming
of
the
dew
on
the
roof
the
stirring
the
palms
the
muffled
snoring
of
the
professor
the
faint
whisper
and
crackle
of
the
fire
a
single
candle
burned
brightly
piling
our
shadows
together
on
the
wall
behind
us
moonlight
silvered
the
over
which
crawled
multitudes
of
moths
attracted
by
the
candle
within
see
their
tiny
eyes
glow
she
whispered
how
their
wings
quiver
and
all
for
a
alas
alas
fire
is
the
undoing
of
us
all
she
leaned
forward
resting
as
though
buried
in
reverie
after
a
while
she
extended
one
foot
a
trifle
and
with
the
point
of
her
shoe
carefully
unlatched
the
as
it
swung
outward
a
delicious
fragrance
filled
the
room
they
done
she
said
withdrawing
her
hand
from
mine
help
me
to
lift
them
out
together
we
arranged
the
delicious
pastry
in
rows
on
the
bench
to
cool
i
opened
the
door
for
a
few
minutes
then
closed
and
bolted
it
again
do
you
suppose
those
transparent
creatures
will
smell
the
odor
and
come
around
the
cabin
she
suggested
wiping
her
fingers
on
her
handkerchief
i
walked
to
the
window
uneasily
outside
the
pane
the
moths
crawled
some
brilliant
in
scarlet
and
set
with
black
some
with
black
tracings
on
their
wings
and
bodies
edged
with
orange
the
scientist
in
me
was
aroused
i
called
her
to
the
window
and
she
came
and
leaned
against
the
sill
nose
pressed
to
the
glass
i
do
suppose
you
know
that
the
antennæ
of
that
moth
are
distinctly
pectinate
i
said
of
course
i
do
she
said
i
took
my
degree
as
at
barnard
college
what
i
exclaimed
in
astonishment
you
been
through
barnard
you
are
a
doctor
of
entomology
it
was
my
undoing
she
said
the
department
was
abolished
the
year
i
graduated
there
was
no
similar
vacancy
even
in
the
smithsonian
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
eyes
fixed
on
the
moths
i
had
to
make
my
own
living
i
chose
stenography
as
the
quickest
road
to
she
looked
up
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
i
suppose
you
took
me
for
an
inferior
she
said
but
do
you
suppose
i
flirt
with
you
if
i
was
she
pressed
her
face
to
the
pane
again
murmuring
that
exquisite
poem
of
andrew
lang
spooning
is
innocuous
and
need
have
a
sequel
but
recollect
if
spoon
you
must
spoon
only
with
your
equal
standing
there
watching
the
moths
we
became
rather
silent
i
know
why
the
fire
in
the
range
had
gone
out
the
flaring
above
a
saucer
of
melted
wax
sank
lower
and
lower
suddenly
as
though
disturbed
by
something
inside
the
moths
all
left
the
darting
off
in
the
darkness
that
curious
i
said
what
curious
she
asked
opening
her
eyes
languidly
good
gracious
was
that
a
bat
that
beat
on
the
window
i
saw
nothing
i
said
disturbed
listen
a
soft
sound
against
the
glass
as
though
invisible
fingers
were
feeling
the
pane
a
gentle
rubbing
then
a
all
but
inaudible
is
it
a
bird
can
you
see
she
whispered
the
behind
us
flashed
and
expired
moonlight
flooded
the
pane
the
sounds
continued
but
there
was
nothing
there
we
understood
now
what
it
was
that
so
gently
rubbed
and
patted
the
glass
outside
with
one
accord
we
noiselessly
gathered
up
the
pies
and
carried
them
into
my
room
then
she
walked
to
the
door
of
her
room
turned
held
out
her
hand
and
whispering
a
demain
monsieur
slipped
into
her
room
and
softly
closed
the
door
and
all
night
long
i
lay
in
troubled
slumber
beside
the
pies
a
rifle
resting
on
the
blankets
beside
me
a
revolver
under
my
pillow
and
i
dreamed
of
moths
with
brilliant
eyes
and
vast
silvery
wings
harnessed
to
a
balloon
in
which
miss
barrison
and
i
sat
arms
around
each
other
eating
slice
after
slice
of
xvii
dawn
came
the
dawn
of
a
day
that
i
am
destined
never
to
forget
long
rosy
streamers
of
light
broke
through
the
forest
shaking
quivering
like
unstable
beams
from
celestial
mist
floated
upward
from
marsh
and
lake
and
through
it
the
spectral
palms
loomed
drooping
fronds
embroidered
with
dew
for
a
while
the
ringing
outburst
of
bird
music
dominated
all
but
it
soon
ceased
with
dropping
notes
from
the
crimson
cardinals
repeated
in
lengthening
minor
intervals
and
then
the
spell
of
silence
returned
broken
only
by
the
faint
splash
of
mullet
mocking
the
sun
with
sinuous
silver
flashes
said
a
low
voice
from
the
door
as
i
stood
encouraging
the
with
splinter
wood
and
dead
palmetto
fans
fresh
and
sweet
from
her
toilet
as
a
rose
miss
barrison
stood
there
sniffing
the
morning
air
daintily
thoroughly
too
much
perfume
she
said
too
much
like
in
a
central
park
smells
sweeter
on
an
april
morning
are
you
criticising
the
wild
jasmine
i
asked
i
criticising
an
exotic
smell
am
i
not
permitted
to
comment
on
the
tropics
fishing
out
a
cedar
log
from
the
i
fell
to
chopping
it
vigorously
the
made
a
cheerful
racket
through
the
woods
did
you
hear
anything
last
night
after
you
retired
i
asked
something
was
at
my
window
something
that
thumped
softly
and
seemed
to
be
feeling
all
over
the
glass
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
silly
enough
to
remain
dressed
all
night
you
do
look
it
i
said
oh
when
daylight
came
i
had
a
chance
she
added
laughing
all
the
same
said
i
leaning
on
the
axe
and
watching
her
you
are
about
the
coolest
and
pluckiest
woman
i
ever
knew
we
were
all
in
the
same
fix
she
said
modestly
no
we
were
not
now
i
tell
you
the
truth
my
hair
stood
up
the
greater
part
of
the
night
you
are
looking
upon
a
poltroon
miss
barrison
then
there
was
something
at
your
window
too
something
a
dozen
they
were
monkeying
with
the
sashes
and
panes
all
night
long
and
i
imagined
that
i
could
hear
them
breathing
as
though
from
effort
of
intense
eagerness
ouch
i
came
as
near
losing
my
nerve
as
i
care
to
i
came
within
an
ace
of
hurling
those
cursed
pies
through
the
window
at
them
i
bolt
if
i
was
afraid
to
play
the
coward
most
people
are
brave
for
that
reason
she
said
the
dog
who
had
slept
under
my
bunk
and
who
had
contributed
to
my
entertainment
by
sighing
and
moaning
all
night
now
appeared
ready
for
business
business
in
his
case
being
the
operation
of
feeding
i
presented
him
with
a
concentrated
tablet
which
he
cautiously
investigated
and
then
rolled
on
nice
testimonial
for
the
people
who
concocted
it
i
said
in
disgust
i
wish
i
had
an
egg
there
are
some
concentrated
egg
tablets
in
the
shanty
said
miss
barrison
but
the
idea
was
not
attractive
i
refuse
to
fry
a
pill
for
breakfast
i
said
sullenly
and
set
the
on
the
coals
in
spite
of
the
dewy
beauty
of
the
morning
breakfast
was
not
a
cheerful
function
professor
farrago
appeared
clad
in
and
khaki
i
had
seldom
seen
him
depressed
but
he
was
now
and
his
very
efforts
to
disguise
it
only
emphasized
his
visible
anxiety
his
preparations
for
the
day
too
had
an
ominous
aspect
to
me
he
gave
his
orders
and
we
obeyed
instinctively
suppressing
questions
first
he
and
i
transported
all
personal
luggage
of
the
company
to
the
big
electric
launch
miss
barrison
effects
his
and
my
own
his
private
papers
the
stenographic
reports
and
all
memoranda
were
tied
up
together
and
carried
aboard
then
to
my
surprise
two
weeks
concentrated
rations
for
two
and
mineral
water
sufficient
for
the
same
period
were
stowed
away
aboard
the
launch
several
times
he
asked
me
whether
i
knew
how
to
run
the
boat
and
i
assured
him
that
i
did
in
a
short
time
nothing
was
left
ashore
except
the
bare
furnishings
of
the
cabin
the
female
the
steel
cage
and
chemicals
which
i
had
brought
and
the
twelve
the
latter
under
lock
and
key
in
my
room
as
the
preparations
came
to
an
end
the
professor
gentle
melancholy
seemed
to
deepen
once
i
ventured
to
ask
him
if
he
was
indisposed
and
he
replied
that
he
had
never
felt
in
better
physical
condition
presently
he
bade
me
fetch
the
pies
and
i
brought
them
and
at
a
sign
from
him
placed
them
inside
the
steel
cage
closing
and
locking
the
door
i
believe
he
said
glancing
from
miss
barrison
to
me
and
from
me
to
the
dog
i
believe
that
we
are
ready
to
start
he
went
to
the
cabin
and
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
pocketing
the
key
then
he
backed
up
to
the
steel
cage
stooped
and
lifted
his
end
as
i
lifted
mine
and
together
we
started
off
through
the
forest
bearing
the
cage
between
us
as
porters
carry
a
heavy
piece
of
luggage
miss
barrison
came
next
carrying
the
trousseau
the
tank
hose
and
chemicals
and
the
dog
followed
her
probably
not
from
affection
for
us
but
because
he
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
we
walked
in
silence
the
professor
and
i
keeping
an
instinctive
lookout
for
snakes
but
we
encountered
nothing
of
that
sort
on
every
side
touching
our
shoulders
crowded
the
closely
woven
and
impenetrable
tangle
of
the
jungle
and
we
threaded
it
along
a
narrow
path
which
he
no
doubt
had
cut
for
the
machete
marks
were
still
fresh
and
the
blazes
on
hickory
and
palm
were
all
wet
with
dripping
sap
and
swarming
with
eager
brilliant
butterflies
at
times
across
our
course
flowed
shallow
rapid
streams
of
water
clear
as
crystal
and
most
alluring
to
the
thirsty
there
fever
in
every
drop
said
the
professor
as
i
mentioned
my
thirst
take
the
bottled
water
if
you
mean
to
stay
a
little
longer
stay
where
i
asked
on
earth
he
replied
tersely
and
we
marched
on
the
beauty
of
the
tropics
is
marred
somewhat
for
me
under
all
the
fresh
splendor
of
color
death
lurks
in
brilliant
tints
where
painted
fruit
hangs
temptingly
where
great
silky
blossoms
exhale
alluring
scent
where
the
elaps
coils
inlaid
with
scarlet
black
and
saffron
where
in
the
shadow
of
a
palmetto
frond
a
succession
of
velvety
black
diamonds
mark
the
rattler
swollen
length
there
death
is
and
his
invisible
consort
horror
creeps
where
the
snake
whose
mouth
is
lined
with
white
creeps
where
the
tarantula
squats
hairy
motionless
where
a
bit
of
living
enamel
fringed
with
orange
undulates
along
a
mossy
log
thinking
of
these
things
and
watchful
lest
unawares
terror
unfold
from
some
blossoming
and
leafy
covert
i
scarcely
noticed
the
beauty
of
the
glade
we
had
entered
a
long
oval
with
sunshine
which
fell
on
hedges
of
chin
high
interlaced
with
golden
blossoms
of
the
jasmine
and
all
around
like
pillars
supporting
a
high
green
canopy
above
a
throne
towered
the
silvery
stems
of
palms
fretted
with
pale
lichens
and
hung
with
draperies
of
this
is
the
place
said
professor
farrago
his
quiet
passionless
voice
sounded
strange
to
me
his
words
seemed
strange
too
each
one
heavily
weighted
with
hidden
meaning
we
set
the
cage
on
the
ground
he
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
and
kneeling
carefully
arranged
the
pies
along
the
centre
of
the
cage
i
have
a
curious
presentiment
he
said
that
i
shall
not
come
out
of
this
experiment
unscathed
do
for
heaven
sake
say
that
i
broke
out
my
nerves
on
edge
again
why
not
he
asked
surprised
i
am
not
afraid
not
afraid
to
die
i
demanded
exasperated
who
spoke
of
dying
he
inquired
mildly
what
i
said
was
that
i
do
not
expect
to
come
out
of
this
affair
unscathed
i
did
not
comprehend
his
meaning
but
i
understood
the
reproof
conveyed
he
closed
and
locked
the
cage
door
again
and
came
towards
us
balancing
the
key
across
the
palm
of
his
hand
miss
barrison
had
seated
herself
on
the
leaves
i
stood
back
as
the
professor
sat
down
beside
her
then
at
a
gesture
from
him
took
the
place
he
indicated
on
his
left
before
we
begin
he
said
calmly
there
are
several
things
you
ought
to
know
and
which
i
have
not
yet
told
you
the
first
concerns
the
feminine
wearing
apparel
which
gilland
brought
me
he
turned
to
miss
barrison
and
asked
her
whether
she
had
brought
a
complete
outfit
and
she
opened
the
bundle
on
her
knees
and
handed
it
to
him
i
can
not
he
said
delicately
explain
in
so
many
words
what
use
i
expect
to
make
of
this
apparel
nor
do
i
yet
know
whether
i
shall
have
any
use
at
all
for
it
that
can
only
be
a
theoretical
speculation
until
within
a
few
more
hours
my
theory
is
proven
or
disproven
and
he
said
suddenly
turning
on
me
my
theory
concerning
these
invisible
creatures
is
the
most
extraordinary
and
audacious
theory
ever
entertained
by
man
since
columbus
presumed
that
there
must
lie
somewhere
a
hidden
continent
which
nobody
had
ever
seen
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
protruding
forehead
lost
for
a
moment
in
deepest
reflection
then
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
sphyx
he
asked
it
seems
to
me
that
ponce
de
leon
wrote
of
something
i
began
hesitating
yes
the
famous
lines
in
the
third
volume
which
have
set
so
many
wise
men
guessing
you
recall
them
there
alas
within
sound
of
the
fountain
of
youth
whose
waters
tint
the
skin
till
the
whole
body
glows
softly
like
the
petal
of
a
rose
there
alas
in
the
new
world
already
the
eternal
enigma
beheld
in
the
flesh
living
yet
it
faded
even
as
i
looked
although
i
swear
it
lived
and
breathed
this
is
the
a
silence
then
i
said
those
lines
are
meaningless
to
me
not
to
me
said
miss
barrison
softly
the
professor
looked
at
her
ah
child
ever
subtler
ever
surer
the
eternal
enigma
is
no
enigma
to
you
what
is
the
sphyx
i
asked
have
you
read
de
soto
or
goya
yes
both
i
remember
now
that
de
soto
records
the
syachas
legend
of
the
sphyx
something
about
a
goddess
not
a
goddess
said
miss
barrison
her
lips
touched
with
a
smile
sometimes
said
the
professor
gently
and
goya
said
has
come
to
my
ears
while
in
the
lands
of
the
syachas
that
the
sphyx
surely
lives
as
bolder
and
more
curious
men
than
i
may
god
willing
prove
to
the
world
but
what
is
the
sphyx
i
insisted
for
centuries
wise
men
and
savants
have
asked
each
other
that
question
i
have
answered
it
for
myself
i
am
now
to
prove
it
i
trust
his
face
darkened
and
again
and
again
he
stroked
his
heavy
brow
if
anything
occurs
he
said
taking
my
hand
in
his
left
and
miss
barrison
hand
in
his
right
promise
me
to
obey
my
wishes
will
you
yes
we
said
together
if
i
lose
my
life
or
or
disappear
promise
me
on
your
honor
to
get
to
the
electric
launch
as
soon
as
possible
and
make
all
speed
northward
placing
my
private
papers
the
reports
of
miss
barrison
and
your
own
reports
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
in
bronx
park
do
attempt
to
aid
me
do
delay
to
search
for
me
do
you
promise
yes
we
breathed
together
he
looked
at
us
solemnly
if
you
fail
me
you
betray
me
he
said
we
swore
obedience
then
let
us
begin
he
said
and
he
rose
and
went
to
the
steel
cage
unlocking
the
door
he
flung
it
wide
and
stepped
inside
leaving
the
cage
door
open
the
moment
a
single
pie
is
disturbed
he
said
to
me
i
shall
close
the
steel
door
from
the
inside
and
you
and
miss
barrison
will
then
dump
the
rosium
oxide
and
the
strontium
into
the
tank
clap
on
the
lid
turn
the
nozzle
of
the
hose
on
the
cage
and
spray
it
thoroughly
whatever
is
invisible
in
the
cage
will
become
visible
and
of
a
faint
rose
color
and
when
the
trapped
creature
becomes
visible
hold
yourselves
ready
to
aid
me
as
long
as
i
am
able
to
give
you
orders
after
that
either
all
will
go
well
or
all
will
go
otherwise
and
you
must
run
for
the
launch
he
seated
himself
in
the
cage
near
the
open
door
i
placed
the
steel
tank
near
the
cage
uncoiled
the
hose
attachment
unscrewed
the
top
and
dumped
in
the
salts
of
strontium
miss
barrison
unwrapped
the
bottle
of
rosium
oxide
and
loosened
the
cork
we
examined
this
powder
and
shook
it
up
so
that
it
might
run
out
quickly
then
miss
barrison
sat
down
and
presently
became
absorbed
in
a
stenographic
report
of
the
proceedings
up
to
date
when
miss
barrison
finished
her
report
she
handed
me
the
bundle
of
papers
i
stowed
them
away
in
my
wallet
and
we
sat
down
together
beside
the
tank
inside
the
cage
professor
farrago
was
seated
his
spectacled
eyes
fixed
on
the
row
of
pies
for
a
while
although
realizing
perfectly
that
our
quarry
was
transparent
and
invisible
we
unconsciously
strained
our
eyes
in
quest
of
something
stirring
in
the
forest
i
should
think
said
i
in
a
low
voice
that
the
odor
of
the
pies
might
draw
at
least
one
out
of
the
odd
dozen
that
came
rubbing
up
against
my
window
last
night
hush
listen
she
breathed
but
we
heard
nothing
save
the
snoring
of
the
overfed
dog
at
our
feet
he
give
us
ample
notice
by
butting
into
miss
barrison
skirts
i
observed
no
need
of
our
watching
professor
the
professor
nodded
presently
he
removed
his
spectacles
and
lay
back
against
the
bars
closing
his
eyes
at
first
the
forest
silence
seemed
cheerful
there
in
the
flecked
sunlight
the
spotted
gyrated
merrily
chased
by
the
shy
hopped
from
branch
to
twig
peering
at
us
in
friendly
inquiry
a
lithe
gray
squirrel
plumy
tail
undulating
rambled
serenely
around
the
cage
sniffing
at
the
pastry
within
suddenly
without
apparent
reason
the
squirrel
sprang
to
a
hung
a
moment
on
the
bark
quivering
all
over
then
dashed
away
into
the
jungle
why
did
he
act
like
that
whispered
miss
barrison
and
after
a
moment
how
still
it
is
where
have
the
birds
gone
in
the
ominous
silence
the
dog
began
to
whimper
in
his
sleep
and
his
hind
legs
kicked
convulsively
he
dreaming
i
began
the
words
were
almost
driven
down
my
throat
by
the
dog
who
without
a
yelp
of
warning
hurled
himself
at
miss
barrison
and
alighted
on
my
chest
fore
paws
around
my
neck
i
cast
him
scornfully
from
me
but
he
scrambled
back
digging
like
a
mole
to
get
under
us
the
transparent
creatures
whispered
miss
barrison
look
see
that
pie
move
i
sprang
to
my
feet
just
as
the
professor
jamming
on
his
spectacles
leaned
forward
and
slammed
the
cage
door
i
got
one
he
shouted
frantically
there
one
in
the
cage
turn
on
that
hose
wait
a
second
said
miss
barrison
calmly
uncorking
the
bottle
and
pouring
a
pearly
stream
of
rosium
oxide
into
the
tank
quick
fizzing
screw
on
the
top
in
a
second
i
had
screwed
the
top
fast
seized
the
hose
and
directed
a
hissing
cloud
of
vapor
through
the
cage
bars
for
a
moment
nothing
was
heard
save
the
whistling
rush
of
the
perfumed
spray
escaping
a
delicious
odor
of
roses
filled
the
air
then
slowly
there
in
the
sunshine
a
misty
something
grew
in
the
cage
a
glistening
phantom
imperceptibly
taking
shape
in
space
vague
at
first
as
a
shred
of
lake
vapor
then
lengthening
rounding
into
flowing
form
clearer
clearer
the
sphyx
gasped
the
professor
in
the
name
of
heaven
play
that
hose
as
he
spoke
the
treacherous
hose
burst
a
showery
pillar
of
vapor
enveloped
everything
through
the
thickening
fog
for
one
brief
instant
a
human
form
appeared
like
magic
a
form
flawless
exquisite
as
a
statue
pure
as
marble
then
the
swimming
vapor
buried
it
cage
pies
and
all
we
ran
frantically
around
the
cage
in
the
obscurity
appealing
for
instructions
and
feeling
for
the
bars
once
the
professor
muffled
voice
was
heard
demanding
the
wearing
apparel
and
i
groped
about
and
found
it
and
stuffed
it
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
do
you
need
help
i
shouted
there
was
no
response
staring
around
through
the
thickening
vapor
of
rosium
rolling
in
clouds
from
the
overturned
tank
i
heard
miss
barrison
voice
calling
i
ca
move
a
transparent
lady
is
holding
me
blindly
i
rushed
about
arms
outstretched
and
the
next
moment
struck
the
door
of
the
cage
so
hard
that
the
impact
almost
knocked
me
senseless
clutching
it
to
steady
myself
it
suddenly
flew
open
a
rush
of
partly
visible
creatures
passed
me
like
a
burst
of
pink
flames
and
in
the
midst
borne
swiftly
away
on
the
crest
of
the
outrush
the
professor
passed
like
a
bolt
shot
from
a
catapult
and
his
last
cry
came
wafted
back
to
me
from
the
forest
as
i
swayed
there
drunk
with
the
stupefying
perfume
do
worry
i
all
right
i
staggered
out
into
the
clearer
air
towards
a
figure
seen
dimly
through
swirling
vapor
are
you
hurt
i
stammered
clasping
miss
barrison
in
my
arms
no
oh
no
she
said
wringing
her
hands
but
the
professor
i
saw
him
i
could
not
scream
i
could
not
move
had
him
i
saw
him
too
i
groaned
there
was
not
one
trace
of
terror
on
his
face
he
was
actually
smiling
overcome
at
the
sublime
courage
of
the
man
we
wept
in
each
arms
true
to
our
promise
to
professor
farrago
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
northward
and
it
was
not
a
difficult
journey
by
any
means
the
voyage
in
the
launch
across
okeechobee
being
perfectly
simple
and
the
trail
to
the
nearest
railroad
station
but
a
few
easy
miles
from
the
shocking
as
had
been
our
experience
dreadful
as
was
the
calamity
which
had
not
only
robbed
me
of
a
friend
but
had
also
bereaved
the
entire
scientific
world
i
could
not
seem
to
feel
that
desperate
and
hopeless
grief
which
the
natural
decease
of
a
close
friend
might
warrant
no
there
remained
a
vague
expectancy
which
so
dominated
my
sorrow
that
at
moments
i
became
hopeful
nay
sanguine
that
i
should
one
day
again
behold
my
beloved
superior
in
the
flesh
there
was
something
so
happy
in
his
last
smile
something
so
artlessly
pleased
that
i
was
certain
no
fear
of
impending
dissolution
worried
him
as
he
disappeared
into
the
uncharted
depth
of
the
unknown
everglades
i
think
miss
barrison
agreed
with
me
too
she
appeared
to
be
more
or
less
dazed
which
was
of
course
quite
natural
and
during
our
return
voyage
across
okeechobee
and
through
the
lagoons
and
forests
beyond
she
was
very
silent
when
we
reached
the
railroad
at
portulacca
a
thrifty
ranch
on
the
volusia
and
chinkapin
railway
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
present
my
dog
to
the
but
i
was
obliged
to
give
him
five
dollars
before
he
consented
to
accept
the
dog
however
miss
barrison
interviewed
the
wife
a
kindly
pitiful
soul
who
promised
to
be
a
good
mistress
to
the
creature
we
both
felt
better
after
that
was
off
our
minds
we
felt
better
still
when
the
train
rolled
leisurely
into
the
white
glare
of
portulacca
and
presently
rolled
out
again
quite
as
leisurely
bound
thank
heaven
for
that
abused
aggregation
of
sinful
boroughs
called
new
york
except
for
one
young
man
whom
i
encountered
in
the
smoker
we
had
the
train
to
ourselves
a
circumstance
which
curiously
enough
appeared
to
increase
miss
barrison
depression
and
my
own
as
a
natural
sequence
the
circumstances
of
the
taking
off
of
professor
farrago
appeared
to
engross
her
thoughts
so
completely
that
it
made
me
uneasy
during
our
trip
out
from
little
sprite
in
fact
it
was
growing
plainer
to
me
every
hour
that
in
her
brief
acquaintance
with
that
distinguished
scientist
she
had
become
personally
attached
to
him
to
an
extent
that
began
to
worry
me
her
personal
indignation
at
the
caged
sphyx
flared
out
at
unexpected
intervals
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
her
unhappiness
and
resentment
were
becoming
morbid
i
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
the
smoking
compartment
tenanted
only
by
a
single
passenger
and
myself
he
was
an
agreeable
young
man
although
in
the
natural
acquaintanceship
that
we
struck
up
i
regretted
to
learn
that
he
was
a
writer
of
popular
fiction
returning
from
fort
worth
where
he
had
been
for
the
sole
purpose
of
composing
a
poem
on
florida
i
have
always
in
common
with
other
mentally
balanced
savants
despised
writers
of
fiction
all
scientists
harbor
a
natural
antipathy
to
romance
in
any
form
and
that
antipathy
becomes
a
deep
horror
if
fiction
dares
to
deal
flippantly
with
the
exact
sciences
or
if
some
degraded
intellect
assumes
the
warrantless
liberty
of
using
natural
history
as
the
vehicle
for
silly
tales
never
but
once
had
i
been
tempted
to
romance
in
any
form
never
but
once
had
sentiment
interfered
with
a
passionless
transfer
of
scientific
notes
to
the
sanctuary
of
the
unvarnished
or
the
cloister
of
the
juiceless
monograph
nor
have
i
the
slightest
approach
to
that
superficial
and
doubtful
quality
known
as
literary
skill
once
however
as
i
sat
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
classifying
my
isopods
i
was
not
only
astonished
but
totally
unprepared
to
find
myself
repeating
aloud
a
verse
that
i
myself
had
unconsciously
fashioned
an
isopod
is
a
work
of
god
never
before
in
all
my
life
had
i
made
a
rhyme
and
it
worried
me
for
weeks
ringing
in
my
brain
day
and
night
confusing
me
interfering
with
my
thoughts
i
said
as
much
to
the
young
man
who
only
laughed
and
replied
that
it
was
the
creator
purpose
to
limit
certain
intellects
nobody
knows
why
and
that
it
was
apparent
that
mine
had
not
escaped
there
one
thing
however
he
said
that
might
be
of
some
interest
to
you
and
come
within
the
circumscribed
scope
of
your
intelligence
and
what
is
that
i
asked
tartly
a
scientific
experience
of
mine
he
said
with
a
careless
laugh
it
so
much
stranger
than
fiction
that
even
professor
bruce
stoddard
of
columbia
hesitated
to
credit
it
i
looked
at
the
young
fellow
suspiciously
his
bland
smile
disarmed
me
but
i
did
not
invite
him
to
relate
his
experience
although
he
apparently
needed
only
that
encouragement
to
begin
now
if
i
could
tell
it
exactly
as
it
occurred
he
observed
and
a
stenographer
could
take
it
down
word
for
word
exactly
as
i
relate
it
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
do
so
said
a
quiet
voice
at
the
door
we
rose
at
once
removing
the
cigars
from
our
lips
but
miss
barrison
bade
us
continue
smoking
and
at
a
gesture
from
her
we
resumed
our
seats
after
she
had
installed
herself
by
the
window
really
she
said
looking
coldly
at
me
i
could
endure
the
solitude
any
longer
is
there
anything
to
do
on
this
tiresome
train
if
you
had
your
pad
and
pencil
i
began
maliciously
you
might
take
down
a
matter
of
interest
she
looked
frankly
at
the
young
man
who
laughed
in
that
pleasant
manner
of
his
and
offered
to
tell
us
of
his
alleged
scientific
experience
if
we
thought
it
might
amuse
us
sufficiently
to
vary
the
dull
monotony
of
the
journey
north
is
it
fiction
i
asked
it
is
absolute
truth
he
replied
i
rose
and
went
off
to
find
pad
and
pencil
when
i
returned
miss
barrison
was
laughing
at
a
story
which
the
young
man
had
just
finished
but
he
ended
gravely
i
have
practically
decided
to
renounce
fiction
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
confine
myself
to
simple
uninteresting
statistics
and
facts
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
i
exclaimed
warmly
he
bowed
looked
at
miss
barrison
and
asked
her
when
he
might
begin
his
story
whenever
you
are
ready
replied
miss
barrison
smiling
in
a
manner
which
i
had
not
observed
since
the
disappearance
of
professor
farrago
i
admit
that
the
young
fellow
was
superficially
attractive
well
then
he
began
modestly
having
no
technical
ability
concerning
the
affair
in
question
and
having
no
knowledge
of
either
comparative
anatomy
or
zoology
i
am
perhaps
unfitted
to
tell
this
story
but
the
story
is
true
the
episode
occurred
under
my
own
eyes
within
a
few
hours
sail
of
the
battery
and
as
i
was
one
of
the
first
persons
to
verify
what
has
long
been
a
theory
among
scientists
and
moreover
as
the
result
of
professor
holroyd
discovery
is
to
be
placed
on
exhibition
in
madison
square
garden
on
the
of
next
month
i
have
decided
to
tell
you
as
simply
as
i
am
able
exactly
what
occurred
i
first
told
the
story
on
april
to
the
editors
of
the
american
popular
science
the
and
the
all
these
gentlemen
rejected
it
some
curtly
informing
me
that
fiction
had
no
place
in
their
columns
when
i
attempted
to
explain
that
it
was
not
fiction
the
editors
of
these
periodicals
either
maintained
a
contemptuous
silence
or
bluntly
notified
me
that
my
literary
services
and
opinions
were
not
desired
but
finally
when
several
publishers
offered
to
take
the
story
as
fiction
i
cut
short
all
negotiations
and
decided
to
publish
it
myself
where
i
am
known
at
all
it
is
my
misfortune
to
be
known
as
a
writer
of
fiction
this
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
receive
a
hearing
from
a
scientific
audience
i
regret
it
bitterly
because
now
when
it
is
too
late
i
am
prepared
to
prove
certain
scientific
matters
of
interest
and
to
produce
the
proofs
in
this
case
however
i
am
fortunate
for
nobody
can
dispute
the
existence
of
a
thing
when
the
bodily
proof
is
exhibited
as
evidence
this
is
the
story
and
if
i
tell
it
as
i
write
fiction
it
is
because
i
do
not
know
how
to
tell
it
otherwise
i
was
walking
along
the
beach
below
pine
inlet
on
the
south
shore
of
long
island
the
railroad
and
telegraph
station
is
at
west
oyster
bay
everybody
who
has
travelled
on
the
long
island
railroad
knows
the
station
but
few
perhaps
know
pine
inlet
of
course
are
familiar
with
it
but
as
there
are
no
hotels
there
and
nothing
to
see
except
salt
meadow
salt
creek
and
a
strip
of
dune
and
sand
the
public
may
probably
be
unaware
of
its
existence
the
local
name
for
the
place
is
pine
inlet
the
maps
give
its
name
as
sand
point
i
believe
but
anybody
at
west
oyster
bay
can
direct
you
to
it
captain
mcpeek
who
keeps
the
west
oyster
bay
house
drives
there
in
winter
it
lies
five
miles
southeast
from
west
oyster
bay
i
had
walked
over
that
afternoon
from
captain
mcpeek
there
was
a
reason
for
my
going
to
pine
inlet
it
embarrasses
me
to
explain
it
but
the
truth
is
i
meditated
writing
an
ode
to
the
ocean
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
write
it
in
west
oyster
bay
with
the
whistle
of
locomotives
in
my
ears
i
knew
that
pine
inlet
was
one
of
the
loneliest
places
on
the
atlantic
coast
it
is
out
of
sight
of
everything
except
leagues
of
gray
ocean
rarely
one
might
make
out
drifting
across
the
horizon
summer
squatters
never
visited
it
sportsmen
shunned
it
except
in
winter
therefore
as
i
was
about
to
do
a
bit
of
poetry
i
thought
that
pine
inlet
was
the
spot
for
the
deed
so
i
went
there
as
i
was
strolling
along
the
beach
biting
my
pencil
reflectively
tremendously
impressed
by
the
solitude
and
the
solemn
thunder
of
the
surf
a
thought
occurred
to
me
how
unpleasant
it
would
be
if
i
suddenly
stumbled
on
a
summer
boarder
as
this
joyless
impossibility
flitted
across
my
mind
i
rounded
a
bleak
a
girl
stood
directly
in
my
path
she
stared
at
me
as
though
i
had
just
crawled
up
out
of
the
sea
to
bite
her
i
do
know
what
my
own
expression
resembled
but
i
have
been
given
to
understand
it
was
idiotic
now
i
perceived
after
a
few
moments
that
the
young
lady
was
frightened
and
i
knew
i
ought
to
say
something
civil
so
i
said
there
many
mosquitoes
here
she
replied
with
a
slight
quiver
in
her
voice
have
only
seen
one
and
it
was
biting
somebody
else
the
conversation
seemed
so
futile
and
the
young
lady
appeared
to
be
more
nervous
than
before
i
had
an
impulse
to
say
not
run
i
have
breakfasted
for
she
seemed
to
be
meditating
a
flight
into
the
breakers
what
i
did
say
was
did
not
know
anybody
was
here
i
do
not
intend
to
intrude
i
come
from
captain
mcpeek
and
i
am
writing
an
ode
to
the
ocean
after
i
had
said
this
it
seemed
to
ring
in
my
ears
like
come
from
table
mountain
and
my
name
is
truthful
james
i
glanced
timidly
at
her
thinking
of
the
same
thing
said
i
to
myself
however
the
young
lady
seemed
to
be
a
trifle
reassured
i
noticed
she
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
looked
at
my
shoes
she
looked
so
long
that
it
made
me
suspicious
and
i
also
examined
my
shoes
they
seemed
to
be
in
a
fair
state
of
repair
i
am
sorry
she
said
would
you
mind
not
walking
on
the
beach
this
was
sudden
i
had
intended
to
retire
and
leave
the
beach
to
her
but
i
did
not
fancy
being
driven
away
so
abruptly
me
she
cried
do
understand
i
do
not
i
would
not
think
for
a
moment
of
asking
you
to
leave
pine
inlet
i
merely
ventured
to
request
you
to
walk
on
the
dunes
i
am
so
afraid
that
your
footprints
may
obliterate
the
impressions
that
my
father
is
studying
said
i
looking
about
me
as
though
i
had
been
caught
in
the
middle
of
a
i
did
not
notice
any
impressions
impressions
of
what
do
know
she
said
smiling
a
little
at
my
awkward
pose
you
step
this
way
in
a
straight
line
you
can
do
no
damage
i
did
as
she
bade
me
i
suppose
my
movements
resembled
the
gait
of
a
wet
peacock
possibly
they
recalled
the
delicate
manoeuvres
of
the
kangaroo
anyway
she
laughed
this
seriously
annoyed
me
i
had
been
at
a
disadvantage
i
walk
well
enough
when
let
alone
can
scarcely
expect
said
i
a
man
absorbed
in
his
own
ideas
could
notice
impressions
on
the
sand
i
trust
i
have
obliterated
nothing
as
i
said
this
i
looked
back
at
the
long
line
of
footprints
stretching
away
in
prospective
across
the
sand
they
were
my
own
how
large
they
looked
was
that
what
she
was
laughing
at
wish
to
explain
she
said
gravely
looking
at
the
point
of
her
parasol
am
very
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
warn
you
to
ask
you
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
strolling
on
a
beach
that
does
not
belong
to
me
perhaps
she
continued
in
sudden
alarm
this
beach
belongs
to
you
beach
oh
no
i
said
but
you
were
going
to
write
poems
about
it
one
and
that
does
not
necessitate
owning
the
beach
i
have
observed
said
i
frankly
the
people
who
own
nothing
write
many
poems
about
it
she
looked
at
me
seriously
write
many
poems
i
added
she
laughed
doubtfully
you
rather
i
went
away
i
asked
politely
family
is
respectable
i
added
and
i
told
her
my
name
then
you
wrote
and
and
you
imitate
maeterlinck
and
you
oh
i
know
lots
of
people
that
you
know
she
cried
with
every
symptom
of
relief
you
know
my
brother
am
the
author
said
i
coldly
but
was
an
earlier
work
which
i
no
longer
recognize
and
i
should
be
grateful
to
you
if
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
deny
that
i
ever
imitated
maeterlinck
possibly
i
added
imitates
me
she
was
very
quiet
and
i
saw
she
was
sorry
mind
i
said
magnanimously
probably
are
not
familiar
with
modern
literature
if
i
knew
your
name
i
should
ask
permission
to
present
myself
i
am
daisy
holroyd
she
said
jack
holroyd
little
sister
she
cried
did
mean
that
said
i
know
that
your
brother
and
i
were
great
friends
in
paris
know
she
said
significantly
of
course
i
said
and
i
were
inseparable
when
shut
in
separate
cells
said
miss
holroyd
coldly
this
unfeeling
allusion
to
the
unfortunate
termination
of
a
celebration
hurt
me
police
said
i
too
officious
jack
says
replied
miss
holroyd
demurely
we
had
unconsciously
moved
on
along
the
side
by
side
as
we
spoke
think
i
repeated
i
should
meet
jack
little
she
said
are
only
three
years
my
senior
she
opened
the
sunshade
and
tipped
it
over
one
shoulder
it
was
white
and
had
spots
and
posies
on
it
sends
us
every
new
book
you
write
she
observed
do
not
approve
of
some
things
you
write
school
i
mumbled
is
no
excuse
she
said
severely
trollope
did
do
it
the
foam
spume
from
the
breakers
was
drifting
across
the
dunes
and
the
little
snipe
ran
along
the
beach
and
teetered
and
whistled
and
spread
their
wings
for
a
low
straight
flight
across
the
shingle
only
to
tip
and
run
and
sail
on
again
the
salt
whistled
and
curled
through
the
crested
waves
blowing
in
perfumed
puffs
across
thickets
of
sweet
bay
and
cedar
as
we
passed
through
the
crackling
myriads
of
fiddler
crabs
raised
their
in
warning
and
backed
away
rustling
through
the
reeds
aggressive
protesting
millions
of
pygmy
ajaxes
defying
the
lightning
i
said
miss
holroyd
laughed
i
never
imagined
that
authors
were
clever
except
in
print
she
said
she
was
a
most
extraordinary
girl
suppose
she
observed
after
a
moment
silence
suppose
i
am
taking
you
to
my
father
i
mumbled
i
had
the
honor
of
meeting
professor
holroyd
in
paris
he
bailed
you
and
jack
out
said
miss
holroyd
serenely
the
silence
was
too
painful
to
last
mcpeek
is
an
interesting
man
i
said
i
spoke
more
loudly
than
i
intended
i
may
have
been
nervous
said
daisy
holroyd
he
has
a
most
singular
hotel
clerk
mean
mr
frisby
do
i
admitted
frisby
is
queer
he
was
once
a
know
it
exclaimed
daisy
holroyd
with
some
heat
ruins
landscapes
whenever
he
has
an
opportunity
do
you
know
that
he
has
a
passion
for
he
has
he
posts
bills
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
it
just
as
you
play
golf
or
tennis
or
squash
he
a
hotel
clerk
now
i
said
employs
him
to
post
bills
know
it
he
does
it
all
by
himself
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
it
papa
has
engaged
him
to
come
down
here
for
two
weeks
and
i
dread
it
said
the
girl
what
professor
holroyd
might
want
of
frisby
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
i
suppose
miss
holroyd
noticed
the
bewilderment
in
my
face
for
she
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
twice
only
frisby
but
captain
mcpeek
also
she
said
do
mean
to
say
that
captain
mcpeek
is
going
to
close
his
hotel
i
exclaimed
my
trunk
was
there
it
contained
guarantees
of
my
respectability
no
his
wife
will
keep
it
open
replied
the
girl
you
can
see
papa
now
he
digging
i
blurted
out
i
remembered
professor
holroyd
as
a
prim
spectacled
gentleman
with
snowy
beard
and
a
clerical
allure
the
man
i
saw
digging
wore
green
goggles
a
jersey
a
battered
and
of
rubber
he
was
delving
in
the
muck
of
the
salt
meadow
his
face
streaming
with
perspiration
his
boots
and
jersey
splashed
with
mud
he
glanced
up
as
we
approached
shading
his
eyes
with
a
sunburned
hand
dear
said
miss
holroyd
is
jack
friend
whom
you
bailed
out
of
mazas
the
introduction
was
startling
i
turned
crimson
with
mortification
the
professor
was
very
decent
about
it
he
called
me
by
name
at
once
then
he
looked
at
his
spade
it
was
clear
he
considered
me
a
nuisance
and
wished
to
go
on
with
his
digging
suppose
he
said
are
still
writing
little
i
replied
trying
not
to
speak
sarcastically
my
output
had
rivalled
that
of
duchess
in
quantity
i
mean
seldom
read
fiction
he
said
looking
restlessly
at
the
hole
in
the
ground
miss
holroyd
came
to
my
rescue
was
a
charming
story
you
wrote
last
she
said
should
read
it
you
should
papa
it
all
about
a
fossil
we
both
looked
narrowly
at
miss
holroyd
her
smile
was
guileless
repeated
the
professor
you
care
for
fossils
much
said
i
now
i
am
not
perfectly
sure
what
my
object
was
in
lying
i
looked
at
daisy
holroyd
eyes
they
were
very
grave
said
i
my
hobby
i
think
miss
holroyd
winced
a
little
at
this
i
did
not
care
i
went
on
have
seldom
had
the
opportunity
to
study
the
subject
but
as
a
boy
i
collected
flint
said
the
professor
coldly
they
were
the
nearest
things
to
fossils
obtainable
i
replied
marvelling
at
my
own
mendacity
the
professor
looked
into
the
hole
i
also
looked
i
could
see
nothing
in
it
digging
for
fossils
thought
i
to
myself
said
the
professor
cautiously
might
wish
to
aid
me
in
a
little
research
that
is
to
say
if
you
have
an
inclination
for
fossils
the
was
not
lost
upon
me
have
read
all
your
books
so
eagerly
said
i
to
join
you
to
be
of
service
to
you
in
any
research
however
difficult
and
trying
would
be
an
honor
and
a
privilege
that
i
never
dared
to
hope
for
thought
i
to
myself
do
its
own
work
but
the
professor
was
still
suspicious
how
could
he
help
it
when
he
remembered
jack
escapades
in
which
my
name
was
always
blended
doubtless
he
was
satisfied
that
my
influence
on
jack
was
evil
the
contrary
was
the
case
too
he
said
worrying
the
edge
of
the
excavation
with
his
spade
are
not
things
to
be
lightly
considered
indeed
i
protested
are
the
most
interesting
as
well
as
puzzling
things
in
the
world
said
he
are
i
cried
enthusiastically
i
am
not
looking
for
fossils
observed
the
professor
mildly
this
was
a
facer
i
looked
at
daisy
holroyd
she
bit
her
lip
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
sea
her
eyes
were
wonderful
eyes
you
think
i
was
digging
for
fossils
in
a
salt
meadow
queried
the
professor
can
have
read
very
little
about
the
subject
i
am
digging
for
something
quite
different
i
was
silent
i
knew
that
my
face
was
flushed
i
longed
to
say
what
the
devil
are
you
digging
for
but
i
only
stared
into
the
hole
as
though
hypnotized
mcpeek
and
frisby
ought
to
be
here
he
said
looking
first
at
daisy
and
then
across
the
meadows
i
ached
to
ask
him
why
he
had
subpoenaed
captain
mcpeek
and
frisby
are
coming
said
daisy
shading
her
eyes
you
see
the
speck
on
the
meadows
may
be
a
said
the
professor
holroyd
is
right
i
said
wagon
and
team
and
two
men
are
coming
from
the
north
there
a
dog
beside
the
wagon
it
that
miserable
yellow
dog
of
frisby
gracious
cried
the
professor
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
see
all
that
at
such
a
distance
not
i
said
see
nothing
he
insisted
will
see
that
i
right
presently
i
laughed
the
professor
removed
his
blue
goggles
and
rubbed
them
glancing
obliquely
at
me
you
heard
what
extraordinary
eyesight
have
said
his
daughter
looking
back
at
her
father
says
that
he
can
tell
exactly
what
kind
of
a
duck
is
flying
before
most
people
could
see
anything
at
all
in
the
sky
true
i
said
comes
to
anybody
i
fancy
who
has
had
practice
the
professor
regarded
me
with
a
new
interest
there
was
inspiration
in
his
eyes
he
turned
towards
the
ocean
for
a
long
time
he
stared
at
the
tossing
waves
on
the
beach
then
he
looked
far
out
to
where
the
horizon
met
the
sea
there
any
ducks
out
there
he
asked
at
last
said
i
scanning
the
sea
are
he
produced
a
pair
of
binoculars
from
his
pocket
adjusted
them
and
raised
them
to
his
eyes
what
sort
of
ducks
i
looked
more
carefully
holding
both
hands
over
my
forehead
and
widgeon
there
is
one
bufflehead
among
them
no
two
the
rest
are
coots
i
replied
cried
the
professor
most
astonishing
i
have
good
eyes
but
i
ca
see
a
blessed
thing
without
these
binoculars
not
extraordinary
said
i
and
coots
any
novice
might
recognize
the
widgeon
and
buffleheads
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
name
unless
they
had
risen
from
the
water
it
is
easy
to
tell
any
duck
when
it
is
flying
even
though
it
looks
no
bigger
than
a
black
but
the
professor
insisted
that
it
was
marvellous
and
he
said
that
i
might
render
him
invaluable
service
if
i
would
consent
to
come
and
camp
at
pine
inlet
for
a
few
weeks
i
looked
at
his
daughter
but
she
turned
her
back
her
back
was
beautifully
moulded
her
gown
fitted
also
out
here
i
repeated
pretending
to
be
unpleasantly
surprised
do
not
think
he
would
care
to
said
miss
holroyd
without
turning
i
had
not
expected
that
all
things
said
i
in
a
clear
pleasant
voice
like
to
camp
out
she
said
nothing
is
not
exactly
camping
said
the
professor
you
shall
see
our
conservatory
daisy
come
dear
you
must
put
on
a
heavier
frock
it
is
getting
towards
sundown
at
that
moment
over
a
near
dune
two
horses
heads
appeared
followed
by
two
human
heads
then
a
wagon
then
a
yellow
dog
i
turned
triumphantly
to
the
professor
are
the
very
man
i
want
he
muttered
very
man
the
very
man
i
looked
at
daisy
holroyd
she
returned
my
glance
with
a
defiant
little
smile
said
captain
mcpeek
driving
up
we
be
git
out
frisby
frisby
fat
nervous
and
sentimental
hopped
out
of
the
cart
said
the
professor
impatiently
moving
across
the
dunes
i
walked
with
daisy
holroyd
mcpeek
and
frisby
followed
the
yellow
dog
walked
by
himself
xviii
the
sun
was
dipping
into
the
sea
as
we
trudged
across
the
meadows
towards
a
high
dune
covered
with
cedars
and
thickets
of
sweet
bay
i
saw
no
sign
of
habitation
among
the
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
broke
the
gray
line
of
sea
and
sky
save
the
squat
dunes
crowned
with
stunted
cedars
then
as
we
rounded
the
base
of
the
dune
we
almost
walked
into
the
door
of
a
house
my
amazement
amused
miss
holroyd
and
i
noticed
also
a
touch
of
malice
in
her
pretty
eyes
but
she
said
nothing
following
her
father
into
the
house
with
the
slightest
possible
gesture
to
me
was
it
invitation
or
was
it
menace
the
house
was
merely
a
light
wooden
frame
covered
with
some
waterproof
stuff
that
looked
like
a
mixture
of
rubber
and
tar
over
this
in
fact
over
the
whole
roof
was
pitched
an
awning
of
heavy
i
noticed
that
the
house
was
anchored
to
the
sand
by
chains
already
rusted
red
but
this
house
was
not
the
only
building
nestling
in
the
south
shelter
of
the
big
dune
a
hundred
feet
away
stood
another
structure
long
low
also
built
of
wood
it
had
rows
on
rows
of
round
on
every
side
the
ports
were
fitted
with
heavy
glass
hinged
to
swing
open
if
necessary
a
single
big
double
door
occupied
the
front
behind
this
long
low
building
was
still
another
a
mere
shed
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
there
was
somebody
moving
about
inside
the
open
door
as
i
stood
gaping
at
this
mushroom
hamlet
the
professor
appeared
at
the
door
and
asked
me
to
enter
i
stepped
in
at
once
the
house
was
much
larger
than
i
had
imagined
a
straight
hallway
ran
through
the
centre
from
east
to
west
on
either
side
of
this
hallway
were
rooms
the
doors
swinging
wide
open
i
counted
three
doors
on
each
side
the
three
on
the
south
appeared
to
be
bedrooms
the
professor
ushered
me
into
a
room
on
the
north
side
where
i
found
captain
mcpeek
and
frisby
sitting
at
a
table
upon
which
were
drawings
and
sketches
of
articulated
animals
and
fishes
see
mcpeek
said
the
professor
only
wanted
one
more
man
and
i
think
i
got
him
have
i
turning
eagerly
to
me
yes
i
said
laughing
is
delightful
am
i
invited
to
stay
here
bedroom
is
the
third
on
the
south
side
everything
is
ready
mcpeek
you
can
bring
his
trunk
ca
you
demanded
the
professor
the
captain
nodded
and
shifted
a
quid
it
all
settled
said
the
professor
and
he
drew
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
see
he
said
turning
to
me
was
at
my
end
to
know
whom
to
trust
i
never
thought
of
you
jack
out
in
china
and
i
did
dare
trust
anybody
in
my
own
profession
all
you
care
about
is
writing
verses
and
stories
is
it
like
to
shoot
i
replied
mildly
the
thing
he
cried
beaming
at
us
all
in
turn
i
can
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
progress
rapidly
mcpeek
you
and
frisby
must
get
those
boxes
up
here
before
dark
dinner
will
be
ready
before
you
have
finished
unloading
dick
you
will
wish
to
go
to
your
room
first
my
name
is
dick
but
he
spoke
so
kindly
and
beamed
upon
me
in
such
a
fatherly
manner
that
i
let
it
go
i
had
occasion
to
correct
him
afterwards
several
times
but
he
always
forgot
the
next
minute
he
calls
me
dick
to
this
day
it
was
dark
when
professor
holroyd
his
daughter
and
i
sat
down
to
dinner
the
room
was
the
same
in
which
i
had
noticed
the
drawings
of
beast
and
bird
but
the
round
table
had
been
extended
into
an
oval
and
neatly
spread
with
dainty
linen
and
silver
a
swedish
girl
appeared
from
a
farther
room
bearing
the
soup
the
professor
ladled
it
out
still
beaming
this
is
very
delightful
is
it
daisy
he
said
said
miss
holroyd
with
a
tinge
of
irony
i
repeated
heartily
suppose
said
the
professor
nodding
mysteriously
at
his
daughter
dick
knows
nothing
of
what
we
about
down
here
suppose
said
miss
holroyd
he
thinks
we
are
digging
for
fossils
i
looked
at
my
plate
she
might
have
spared
me
that
well
said
her
father
smiling
to
himself
shall
know
everything
by
morning
you
be
astonished
dick
my
boy
name
is
dick
corrected
daisy
the
professor
said
it
in
an
way
and
relapsed
into
contemplation
of
my
necktie
i
asked
miss
holroyd
a
few
questions
about
jack
and
was
informed
that
he
had
given
up
law
and
entered
the
consular
service
as
what
i
did
not
dare
ask
for
i
know
what
our
consular
service
is
china
said
daisy
choo
is
the
name
of
the
city
added
her
father
proudly
the
terminus
of
the
new
railway
on
the
pong
ping
said
daisy
added
the
professor
triumphantly
make
a
good
one
i
observed
i
knew
jack
i
pitied
his
consul
so
we
chatted
on
about
my
old
playmate
until
freda
the
maid
brought
coffee
and
the
professor
lighted
a
cigar
with
a
little
bow
to
his
daughter
course
you
do
smoke
she
said
to
me
with
a
glimmer
of
malice
in
her
eyes
must
interposed
the
professor
hastily
will
make
his
hand
tremble
it
wo
said
i
laughing
my
hand
will
shake
if
i
smoke
are
you
going
to
employ
me
as
a
draughtsman
know
he
chuckled
with
a
mysterious
smile
at
his
daughter
give
him
my
best
cigars
put
the
box
here
on
the
table
we
ca
afford
to
have
his
hand
tremble
miss
holroyd
rose
and
crossed
the
hallway
to
her
father
room
returning
presently
with
a
box
of
cigars
do
think
he
knows
what
is
good
for
him
she
said
should
smoke
only
one
every
day
it
was
hard
to
bear
i
am
not
vindictive
but
i
decided
to
treasure
up
a
few
of
miss
holroyd
gentle
taunts
my
intimacy
with
her
brother
was
certainly
a
disadvantage
to
me
now
jack
had
apparently
been
talking
too
much
and
his
sister
appeared
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
my
past
it
was
a
disadvantage
i
remembered
her
vaguely
as
a
girl
with
long
braids
who
used
to
come
on
sundays
with
her
father
and
take
tea
with
us
in
our
rooms
then
she
went
to
germany
to
school
and
jack
and
i
employed
our
sunday
evenings
otherwise
it
is
true
that
i
regarded
her
weekly
visits
as
a
species
of
infliction
but
i
did
not
think
i
ever
showed
it
is
strange
said
i
you
did
not
recognize
me
at
once
miss
holroyd
have
i
changed
so
greatly
in
five
years
wore
a
pointed
french
beard
in
paris
she
said
very
downy
one
and
you
never
stayed
to
tea
but
twice
and
then
you
only
spoke
once
said
i
blankly
did
i
say
asked
me
if
i
liked
plums
said
daisy
bursting
into
an
irresistible
ripple
of
laughter
i
saw
that
i
must
have
made
the
same
sort
of
an
ass
of
myself
that
most
boys
of
eighteen
do
it
was
too
bad
i
never
thought
about
the
future
in
those
days
who
could
have
imagined
that
little
daisy
holroyd
would
have
grown
up
into
this
bewildering
young
lady
it
was
really
too
bad
presently
the
professor
retired
to
his
room
carrying
with
him
an
armful
of
drawings
and
bidding
us
not
to
sit
up
late
when
he
closed
his
door
miss
holroyd
turned
to
me
will
work
over
those
drawings
until
midnight
she
said
with
a
despairing
smile
is
good
for
him
i
said
are
the
drawings
may
know
she
answered
leaning
forward
on
the
table
and
shading
her
face
with
one
hand
me
about
yourself
and
jack
in
paris
i
looked
at
her
suspiciously
there
is
much
to
tell
we
studied
jack
went
to
the
law
school
and
i
attended
er
oh
all
sorts
of
schools
you
surely
you
gave
yourself
a
little
recreation
occasionally
i
nodded
am
afraid
you
and
jack
studied
too
hard
may
be
said
i
looking
meek
about
fossils
i
could
stand
that
holroyd
i
said
do
care
for
fossils
you
may
think
that
i
am
a
humbug
but
i
have
a
perfect
mania
for
fossils
now
when
an
hour
ago
i
said
airily
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
that
she
had
flushed
up
it
pleased
me
will
soon
tire
of
the
experiment
she
said
with
a
dangerous
smile
i
may
i
replied
indifferently
she
drew
back
the
movement
was
scarcely
perceptible
but
i
noticed
it
and
she
knew
i
did
the
atmosphere
was
vaguely
hostile
one
feels
such
mental
conditions
and
changes
instantly
i
picked
up
a
opened
it
set
up
the
pieces
with
elaborate
care
and
began
to
move
first
the
white
then
the
black
miss
holroyd
watched
me
coldly
at
first
but
after
a
dozen
moves
she
became
interested
and
leaned
a
shade
nearer
i
moved
a
black
pawn
forward
do
you
do
that
said
daisy
said
i
white
queen
threatens
the
pawn
was
an
aggressive
move
she
insisted
defensive
i
said
her
white
highness
will
let
the
pawn
alone
the
pawn
will
let
the
queen
alone
miss
holroyd
rested
her
chin
on
her
wrist
and
gazed
steadily
at
the
board
she
was
flushing
furiously
but
she
held
her
ground
the
white
queen
does
block
that
pawn
the
pawn
may
become
dangerous
she
said
coldly
i
laughed
and
closed
up
the
board
with
a
snap
i
said
might
even
take
the
queen
after
a
silence
i
asked
would
you
do
in
that
case
miss
holroyd
should
resign
she
said
serenely
then
realizing
what
she
had
said
she
lost
her
for
a
second
and
cried
indeed
i
should
fight
to
the
bitter
end
i
mean
i
asked
lingering
over
my
revenge
mean
she
said
slowly
your
black
pawn
would
never
have
the
chance
never
i
should
take
it
immediately
believe
you
would
said
i
smiling
we
call
the
game
yours
and
the
pawn
captured
do
want
it
she
exclaimed
pawn
is
worthless
when
it
in
the
king
row
is
most
interesting
she
observed
sedately
she
had
completely
recovered
her
still
i
saw
that
she
now
had
a
certain
respect
for
my
defensive
powers
it
was
very
soothing
to
me
know
said
i
gravely
i
am
fonder
of
jack
than
of
anybody
that
the
reason
we
never
write
each
other
except
to
borrow
things
i
am
afraid
that
when
i
was
a
young
cub
in
france
i
was
not
an
attractive
personality
the
contrary
said
daisy
smiling
thought
you
were
very
big
and
very
perfect
i
had
illusions
i
wept
often
when
i
went
home
and
remembered
that
you
never
took
the
trouble
to
speak
to
me
but
once
was
a
cub
i
said
selfish
and
brutal
but
i
understand
i
never
had
any
sisters
and
i
did
know
what
to
say
to
very
young
girls
if
i
had
imagined
that
you
felt
hurt
i
did
five
years
ago
afterwards
i
laughed
at
the
whole
thing
i
repeated
vaguely
disappointed
of
course
i
was
very
easily
hurt
when
i
was
a
child
i
think
i
have
outgrown
it
the
soft
curve
of
her
sensitive
mouth
contradicted
her
you
forgive
me
now
i
asked
i
had
forgotten
the
whole
thing
until
i
met
you
an
hour
or
so
ago
there
was
something
that
had
a
ring
not
entirely
genuine
in
this
speech
i
noticed
it
but
forgot
it
the
next
moment
presently
she
rose
touched
her
hair
with
the
tip
of
one
finger
and
walked
to
the
door
she
said
said
i
opening
the
door
for
her
to
pass
xix
the
sea
was
a
sheet
of
silver
tinged
with
pink
the
tremendous
arch
of
the
sky
was
all
shimmering
and
glimmering
with
the
promise
of
the
sun
already
the
mist
above
flecked
with
clustered
clouds
flushed
with
rose
color
and
dull
gold
i
heard
the
low
splash
of
the
waves
breaking
and
curling
across
the
beach
a
wandering
breeze
fresh
and
fragrant
blew
the
curtains
of
my
window
there
was
the
scent
of
sweet
bay
in
the
room
and
everywhere
the
subtle
nameless
perfume
of
the
sea
when
at
last
i
stood
upon
the
shore
the
air
and
sea
were
all
in
a
rosy
light
deepening
to
crimson
in
the
zenith
along
the
beach
i
saw
a
little
cove
shelving
and
all
where
shallow
waves
washed
with
a
mellow
sound
fine
as
dusted
gold
the
shingle
glowed
and
the
thin
film
of
water
rose
receded
crept
up
again
a
little
higher
and
again
flowed
back
with
the
low
hiss
of
snowy
foam
and
gilded
bubbles
breaking
i
stood
a
little
while
quiet
my
eyes
upon
the
water
the
invitation
of
the
ocean
in
my
ears
vague
and
sweet
as
the
murmur
of
a
shell
then
i
looked
at
my
and
towels
we
go
said
i
aloud
a
second
later
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
i
swam
far
out
to
sea
and
as
i
swam
the
waters
all
around
me
turned
to
gold
the
sun
had
risen
there
is
a
fragrance
in
the
sea
at
dawn
that
none
can
name
whitethorn
in
may
sedges
and
scented
rushes
rustling
in
an
inland
wind
recall
the
sea
to
me
i
ca
say
why
far
out
at
sea
i
raised
myself
swung
around
dived
and
set
out
again
for
shore
striking
strong
strokes
until
the
necked
foam
flew
and
when
at
last
i
shot
through
the
breakers
i
laughed
aloud
and
sprang
upon
the
beach
breathless
and
happy
then
from
the
ocean
came
another
cry
clear
joyous
and
a
white
arm
rose
in
the
air
she
came
drifting
in
with
the
waves
like
a
white
laughing
at
me
and
i
plunged
into
the
breakers
again
to
join
her
side
by
side
we
swam
along
the
coast
just
outside
the
breakers
until
in
the
next
cove
we
saw
the
flutter
of
her
maid
will
beat
you
to
breakfast
she
cried
as
i
rested
watching
her
glide
up
along
the
beach
said
i
a
she
called
across
the
water
i
made
good
speed
along
the
shore
and
i
was
not
long
in
dressing
but
when
i
entered
the
she
was
there
demure
smiling
exquisite
in
her
cool
white
frock
is
yours
said
i
hope
i
can
find
one
with
a
pearl
in
it
the
professor
hurried
in
before
she
could
reply
he
greeted
me
very
cordially
but
there
was
an
abstracted
air
about
him
and
he
called
me
dick
until
i
recognized
that
remonstrance
was
useless
he
was
not
long
over
his
coffee
and
rolls
and
frisby
will
return
with
the
last
load
including
your
trunk
by
early
afternoon
he
said
rising
and
picking
up
his
bundle
of
drawings
have
time
to
explain
to
you
what
we
are
doing
dick
but
daisy
will
take
you
about
and
instruct
you
she
will
give
you
the
rifle
standing
in
my
room
it
a
good
winchester
i
have
sent
for
an
for
you
big
enough
to
knock
over
any
elephant
in
india
daisy
take
him
through
the
sheds
and
tell
him
everything
luncheon
is
at
noon
do
you
usually
take
luncheon
dick
i
am
permitted
i
smiled
said
the
professor
doubtfully
must
come
back
here
for
it
freda
can
take
you
what
you
want
is
your
hand
unsteady
after
eating
papa
said
daisy
you
intend
to
starve
him
we
all
laughed
the
professor
tucked
his
drawings
into
a
capacious
pocket
pulled
his
up
to
his
hips
seized
a
spade
and
left
nodding
to
us
as
though
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
we
went
to
the
door
and
watched
him
across
the
salt
meadows
until
the
distant
hid
him
said
daisy
holroyd
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
shop
she
put
on
a
straw
hat
a
distractingly
pretty
combination
of
filmy
cool
stuffs
and
led
the
way
to
the
long
low
structure
that
i
had
noticed
the
evening
before
the
interior
was
lighted
by
the
numberless
little
and
i
could
see
everything
plainly
i
acknowledge
i
was
nonplussed
by
what
i
did
see
in
the
centre
of
the
shed
which
must
have
been
at
least
a
hundred
feet
long
stood
what
i
thought
at
first
was
the
skeleton
of
an
enormous
whale
after
a
moment
silent
contemplation
of
the
thing
i
saw
that
it
could
not
be
a
whale
for
the
frames
of
two
gigantic
batlike
wings
rose
from
each
shoulder
also
i
noticed
that
the
animal
possessed
legs
four
of
them
with
most
webbed
claws
fully
eight
feet
long
the
bony
framework
of
the
head
too
resembled
something
between
a
crocodile
and
a
monstrous
the
walls
of
the
shanty
were
hung
with
drawings
and
blue
prints
a
man
dressed
in
white
linen
was
tinkering
with
the
vertebrae
of
the
tail
on
earth
did
such
a
reptile
come
from
i
asked
at
length
it
not
real
said
daisy
scornfully
see
said
i
stage
prop
what
asked
daisy
in
hurt
astonishment
a
a
sort
of
siegfried
dragon
a
er
pfafner
or
peffer
or
my
father
heard
you
say
such
things
he
would
dislike
you
said
daisy
she
looked
grieved
and
moved
towards
the
door
i
apologized
for
what
i
knew
not
and
we
became
reconciled
she
ran
into
her
father
room
and
brought
me
the
rifle
a
very
good
winchester
she
also
gave
me
a
full
she
smiled
shall
take
you
to
your
observatory
and
when
we
arrive
you
are
to
begin
your
duty
at
once
that
duty
i
ventured
shouldering
the
rifle
duty
is
to
watch
the
ocean
i
shall
then
explain
the
whole
affair
but
you
must
look
at
me
while
i
speak
you
must
watch
the
sea
said
i
hardship
i
had
rather
go
without
the
luncheon
i
do
not
think
she
was
offended
at
my
speech
still
she
frowned
for
almost
three
seconds
we
passed
through
acres
of
sweet
bay
and
spear
grass
sometimes
skirting
thickets
of
twisted
cedars
sometimes
walking
in
the
full
glare
of
the
morning
sun
sinking
into
shifting
sand
where
shells
crackled
under
our
feet
and
glistened
bronzed
and
iridescent
then
as
we
climbed
a
little
hill
the
freshened
in
our
faces
and
lo
the
ocean
lay
below
us
as
the
eye
could
reach
glittering
magnificent
daisy
sat
down
flat
on
the
sand
it
takes
a
clever
girl
to
do
that
and
retain
the
respectful
deference
due
her
from
men
it
takes
a
graceful
girl
to
accomplish
it
triumphantly
when
a
man
is
looking
must
sit
beside
me
she
said
as
though
it
would
prove
irksome
to
me
she
continued
must
watch
the
water
while
i
am
talking
i
nodded
do
you
do
it
then
she
asked
i
succeeded
in
wrenching
my
head
towards
the
ocean
although
i
felt
sure
it
would
swing
gradually
round
again
in
spite
of
me
begin
with
said
daisy
holroyd
a
thing
in
that
ocean
that
would
astonish
you
if
you
saw
it
turn
your
head
am
i
said
meekly
you
hear
what
i
said
er
a
thing
in
the
ocean
that
going
to
astonish
me
visions
of
mermaids
rose
before
me
thing
said
daisy
a
thermosaurus
i
nodded
vaguely
as
though
anticipating
a
delightful
introduction
to
a
nautical
friend
do
seem
astonished
she
said
reproachfully
should
i
be
i
asked
turn
your
eyes
towards
the
water
suppose
a
thermosaurus
should
look
out
of
the
waves
said
i
that
case
the
pleasure
would
be
mutual
she
frowned
and
bit
her
upper
lip
you
know
what
a
thermosaurus
is
she
asked
i
am
to
guess
said
i
guess
it
a
that
big
ugly
horrible
creature
that
i
showed
you
in
the
shed
cried
daisy
impatiently
i
stammered
either
she
continued
excitedly
a
real
one
this
was
pleasant
news
i
glanced
instinctively
at
my
rifle
and
then
at
the
ocean
said
i
at
last
strikes
me
that
you
and
i
resemble
a
pair
of
andromedas
waiting
to
be
swallowed
this
rifle
wo
stop
a
beast
a
live
beast
like
that
nibelungen
dragon
of
yours
it
will
she
said
not
an
ordinary
rifle
then
for
the
first
time
i
noticed
just
below
the
magazine
a
cylindrical
attachment
that
was
strange
to
me
if
you
will
watch
the
sea
very
carefully
and
will
promise
not
to
look
at
me
said
daisy
will
try
to
explain
she
did
not
wait
for
me
to
promise
but
went
on
eagerly
a
sparkle
of
excitement
in
her
blue
eyes
know
of
all
the
fossil
remains
of
the
great
batlike
and
creatures
that
inhabited
the
earth
ages
and
ages
ago
the
bones
of
the
gigantic
saurians
are
the
most
interesting
i
think
they
used
to
splash
about
the
water
and
fly
over
the
land
during
the
carboniferous
period
anyway
it
does
matter
of
course
you
have
seen
pictures
of
reconstructed
creatures
such
as
the
ichthyosaurus
the
plesiosaurus
the
anthracosaurus
and
the
thermosaurus
i
nodded
trying
to
keep
my
eyes
from
hers
you
know
that
the
remains
of
the
thermosaurus
were
first
discovered
and
reconstructed
by
papa
said
i
there
was
no
use
in
saying
no
am
glad
you
do
now
papa
has
proved
that
this
creature
lived
entirely
in
the
gulf
stream
emerging
for
occasional
flights
across
an
ocean
or
two
can
you
imagine
how
he
proved
it
said
i
resolutely
pointing
my
nose
at
the
ocean
proved
it
by
a
minute
examination
of
the
microscopical
shells
found
among
the
ribs
of
the
thermosaurus
these
shells
contained
little
creatures
that
live
only
in
the
warm
waters
of
the
gulf
stream
they
were
the
food
of
the
thermosaurus
was
rather
slender
rations
for
a
thing
like
that
was
it
did
he
ever
swallow
bigger
food
er
men
yes
tons
of
fossil
bones
from
prehistoric
men
are
also
found
in
the
interior
of
the
thermosaurus
said
i
at
least
had
better
go
back
to
captain
mcpeek
turn
around
do
be
so
foolish
i
did
say
there
was
a
live
thermosaurus
in
the
water
did
i
there
no
my
relief
was
genuine
but
i
thought
of
the
rifle
and
looked
suspiciously
out
to
sea
the
winchester
for
i
asked
and
i
will
explain
papa
has
found
out
how
i
do
not
exactly
understand
that
there
is
in
the
waters
of
the
gulf
stream
the
body
of
a
thermosaurus
the
creature
must
have
been
alive
within
a
year
or
so
the
impenetrable
that
covers
its
body
has
as
far
as
papa
knows
prevented
its
disintegration
we
know
that
it
is
there
still
or
was
there
within
a
few
months
papa
has
reports
and
sworn
depositions
from
steamer
captains
and
seamen
from
a
dozen
different
vessels
all
corroborating
one
another
in
essential
details
these
stories
of
course
get
into
the
newspapers
stories
but
papa
knows
that
they
confirm
his
theory
that
the
huge
body
of
this
reptile
is
swinging
along
somewhere
in
the
gulf
stream
she
opened
her
sunshade
and
held
it
over
her
i
noticed
that
she
deigned
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
about
of
it
duty
with
that
rifle
is
this
if
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
see
the
body
of
the
thermosaurus
come
floating
by
you
are
to
take
good
aim
and
fire
fire
rapidly
every
bullet
in
the
magazine
then
reload
and
fire
again
and
reload
and
fire
as
long
as
you
have
any
cartridges
left
maxim
is
what
i
should
have
i
said
with
gentle
sarcasm
and
suppose
i
make
a
sieve
of
this
big
lizard
you
see
these
rings
in
the
sand
she
asked
sure
enough
somebody
had
driven
heavy
piles
deep
into
the
sand
all
around
us
and
to
the
tops
of
these
piles
were
attached
steel
rings
half
buried
under
the
we
sat
almost
exactly
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
these
rings
reason
is
this
said
daisy
bullet
in
your
cartridges
is
and
to
the
base
of
each
bullet
is
attached
a
thin
wire
of
pallium
pallium
is
that
new
metal
a
thread
of
which
drawn
out
into
finest
wire
will
hold
a
ton
of
iron
suspended
every
bullet
is
fitted
with
minute
coils
of
miles
of
this
wire
when
the
bullet
leaves
the
rifle
it
spins
out
this
wire
as
a
shot
from
a
mortar
spins
out
and
carries
the
to
a
wrecked
ship
the
end
of
each
coil
of
wire
is
attached
to
that
cylinder
under
the
magazine
of
your
rifle
as
soon
as
the
shell
is
automatically
ejected
this
wire
flies
out
also
a
bit
of
scarlet
tape
is
fixed
to
the
end
so
that
it
will
be
easy
to
pick
up
there
is
also
a
on
the
end
and
this
clasp
fits
those
rings
that
you
see
in
the
sand
now
when
you
begin
firing
it
is
my
duty
to
run
and
pick
up
the
wire
ends
and
attach
them
to
the
rings
then
you
see
we
have
the
body
of
the
thermosaurus
full
of
bullets
every
bullet
anchored
to
the
shore
by
tiny
wires
each
of
which
could
easily
hold
a
strain
i
looked
at
her
in
amazement
she
added
calmly
have
captured
the
thermosaurus
father
said
i
at
length
have
spent
years
of
labor
over
this
preparation
is
the
work
of
a
lifetime
she
said
simply
my
face
i
suppose
showed
my
misgivings
must
not
fail
she
added
but
we
are
nowhere
near
the
gulf
stream
i
ventured
her
face
brightened
and
she
frankly
held
the
sunshade
over
us
both
you
do
know
she
said
else
papa
has
discovered
would
you
believe
that
he
has
found
a
loop
in
the
gulf
stream
a
genuine
loop
that
swings
in
here
just
outside
of
the
breakers
below
it
is
true
everybody
on
long
island
knows
that
there
is
a
warm
current
off
the
coast
but
nobody
imagined
it
was
merely
a
sort
of
backwater
from
the
gulf
stream
that
formed
a
great
circular
around
the
cone
of
a
subterranean
volcano
and
rejoined
the
gulf
stream
off
cape
albatross
but
it
is
that
is
why
papa
bought
a
yacht
three
years
ago
and
sailed
about
for
two
years
so
mysteriously
oh
i
did
want
to
go
with
him
so
much
said
i
most
astonishing
she
leaned
enthusiastically
towards
me
her
lovely
face
aglow
it
she
said
to
think
that
you
and
papa
and
i
are
the
only
people
in
the
whole
world
who
know
this
to
be
included
in
such
a
triology
was
very
delightful
is
writing
the
whole
thing
i
mean
about
the
currents
he
also
has
in
preparation
sixteen
volumes
on
the
thermosaurus
he
said
this
morning
that
he
was
going
to
ask
you
to
write
the
story
first
for
some
scientific
magazine
he
is
certain
that
professor
bruce
stoddard
of
columbia
will
write
the
pamphlets
necessary
this
will
give
papa
time
to
attend
to
the
work
which
he
expects
to
finish
in
three
years
us
first
said
i
laughing
our
thermosaurus
must
not
fail
she
said
wistfully
shall
not
fail
i
said
i
promise
to
sit
on
this
as
long
as
i
live
until
a
thermosaurus
appears
if
that
is
your
wish
miss
holroyd
our
eyes
met
for
an
instant
she
did
not
chide
me
either
for
not
looking
at
the
ocean
her
eyes
were
bluer
anyway
suppose
she
said
bending
her
head
and
absently
pouring
sand
between
her
fingers
suppose
you
think
me
a
or
something
odious
exactly
i
said
there
was
an
emphasis
in
my
voice
that
made
her
color
after
a
moment
she
laid
the
sunshade
down
still
open
i
hold
it
i
asked
she
nodded
almost
imperceptibly
the
ocean
had
turned
a
deep
marine
blue
verging
on
purple
that
heralded
a
scorching
afternoon
the
wind
died
away
the
odor
of
cedar
and
hung
heavy
in
the
air
in
the
sand
at
our
feet
an
iridescent
crawled
its
metallic
wings
burning
like
a
spark
great
gnats
with
filmy
glittering
wings
danced
aimlessly
above
the
young
burnished
crickets
inquisitive
timid
ran
from
under
chips
of
driftwood
waved
their
antennæ
at
us
and
ran
back
again
one
by
one
the
marbled
tumbled
at
our
feet
dazed
from
the
exertion
of
an
aërial
flight
then
scrambled
and
ran
a
little
way
or
darted
into
the
wire
grass
where
great
brilliant
spiders
eyed
them
askance
from
their
gossamer
hammocks
far
out
at
sea
the
white
gulls
floated
and
drifted
on
the
water
or
sailed
up
into
the
air
to
flap
lazily
for
a
moment
and
settle
back
among
the
waves
strings
of
black
passed
their
strong
wings
tipping
the
surface
of
the
water
single
wandering
coots
whirled
from
the
breakers
into
lonely
flight
towards
the
horizon
we
lay
and
watched
the
little
running
along
the
edge
now
backing
away
from
the
incoming
tide
now
boldly
wading
after
the
undertow
the
harmony
of
silence
the
deep
perfume
the
mystery
of
waiting
for
that
something
that
all
await
what
is
it
love
death
or
only
the
miracle
of
another
morrow
troubled
me
with
vague
restlessness
as
sunlight
casts
shadows
happiness
too
throws
a
shadow
an
the
shadow
is
sadness
and
so
the
morning
wore
away
until
freda
came
with
a
hamper
then
delicious
cold
fowl
and
lettuce
sandwiches
and
champagne
cup
set
our
tongues
wagging
as
only
very
young
tongues
can
wag
daisy
went
back
with
freda
after
luncheon
leaving
me
a
case
of
cigars
with
a
bantering
smile
i
dozed
half
awake
keeping
a
partly
closed
eye
on
the
ocean
where
a
faint
gray
streak
showed
plainly
amid
the
azure
water
all
around
that
was
the
gulf
stream
loop
about
four
frisby
appeared
with
a
bamboo
for
which
i
was
unaffectedly
grateful
after
he
had
erected
it
over
me
he
stopped
to
chat
a
bit
but
the
conversation
bored
me
for
he
could
talk
of
nothing
but
would
ruin
the
landscape
here
would
you
i
asked
it
repeated
frisby
nervously
ruined
now
there
a
place
to
stick
a
bill
snipe
stick
bills
in
the
sand
i
said
flippantly
there
was
no
humor
about
frisby
they
he
asked
i
moved
with
a
certain
impatience
said
frisby
spice
an
variety
to
nature
they
break
the
monotony
of
the
everlastin
green
and
i
glared
at
him
he
continued
not
easy
to
stick
lem
me
tell
you
sir
a
soft
snap
when
it
comes
to
now
i
guess
i
stuck
more
bills
onto
new
york
state
than
ennybody
you
i
said
angrily
siree
i
always
pick
out
the
purtiest
spots
kinder
filled
chuck
full
of
woods
and
brooks
and
things
then
i
my
onto
a
rock
and
i
slather
that
rock
with
gum
and
whoop
she
goes
what
goes
bill
i
paste
her
onto
the
rock
with
one
swipe
of
the
brush
for
the
edges
and
a
swipe
for
the
finish
except
when
a
bill
is
folded
in
two
halves
what
do
you
do
then
i
asked
disgusted
twice
said
frisby
with
enthusiasm
you
do
think
it
injures
the
landscape
it
he
exclaimed
convinced
that
i
was
attempting
to
joke
i
looked
wearily
out
to
sea
he
also
looked
at
the
water
and
sighed
sentimentally
buoys
with
bills
onto
is
a
idea
of
mine
he
observed
damn
ocean
is
monotonous
ai
it
i
do
know
what
i
might
have
done
to
frisby
the
rifle
was
so
convenient
if
his
mean
yellow
dog
had
not
waddled
up
at
this
juncture
davy
sic
said
frisby
expectorating
upon
a
and
hurling
it
seaward
the
cur
watched
the
flight
of
the
shell
apathetically
then
squatted
in
the
sand
and
looked
at
his
master
lost
his
spirit
said
frisby
he
i
once
stuck
a
bill
onto
davy
an
it
come
off
an
the
paste
sorter
sickened
him
he
was
hell
on
rats
once
after
a
moment
or
two
frisby
took
himself
off
whistling
cheerfully
to
davy
who
followed
him
when
he
was
ready
the
rifle
burned
in
my
fingers
it
was
nearly
six
when
the
professor
appeared
spade
on
shoulder
boots
smeared
with
mud
he
said
to
report
dick
my
boy
professor
he
wiped
his
shining
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
stared
at
the
water
calculations
lead
me
to
believe
he
said
our
prize
may
be
due
any
day
now
this
theory
i
base
upon
the
result
of
the
report
from
the
last
i
saw
i
can
not
understand
why
some
of
these
captains
did
not
take
the
carcass
in
tow
they
all
say
that
they
tried
but
that
the
body
sank
before
they
could
come
within
half
a
mile
the
truth
is
probably
that
they
did
not
stir
a
foot
from
their
course
to
examine
the
thing
you
ever
cruised
about
for
it
i
ventured
two
years
he
said
grimly
no
use
it
accident
when
a
ship
falls
in
with
it
one
captain
reports
it
a
thousand
miles
from
where
the
last
skipper
spoke
it
and
always
in
the
gulf
stream
they
think
it
is
a
different
specimen
every
time
and
the
papers
are
teeming
with
you
sure
i
asked
it
will
swing
into
the
coast
on
this
gulf
stream
loop
think
i
may
say
that
it
is
certain
to
do
so
i
experimented
with
a
dead
you
may
have
heard
of
its
coming
ashore
here
last
summer
think
i
did
said
i
with
a
faint
smile
the
thing
had
poisoned
the
air
for
miles
around
i
continued
it
comes
in
the
night
he
laughed
i
am
lucky
every
night
this
month
and
every
day
too
the
current
of
the
loop
runs
inland
so
far
that
even
a
porpoise
would
strand
for
at
least
twelve
hours
longer
than
that
i
have
not
experimented
with
but
i
know
that
the
shore
trend
of
the
loop
runs
across
a
long
spur
of
the
submerged
volcanic
mountain
and
that
anything
heavier
than
a
porpoise
would
scrape
the
bottom
and
be
carried
so
slowly
that
at
least
twelve
hours
must
elapse
before
the
carcass
could
float
again
into
deep
water
there
are
chances
of
its
stranding
indefinitely
too
but
i
do
care
to
take
those
chances
that
is
why
i
have
stationed
you
here
dick
he
glanced
again
at
the
water
smiling
to
himself
is
another
question
i
want
to
ask
i
said
you
mind
course
not
he
said
warmly
are
you
digging
for
simply
for
exercise
the
doctor
told
me
i
was
killing
myself
with
my
sedentary
habits
so
i
decided
to
dig
i
do
know
a
better
exercise
do
you
suppose
not
i
murmured
rather
red
in
the
face
i
wondered
whether
he
mention
fossils
daisy
tell
you
why
we
are
making
our
thermosaurus
he
asked
i
shook
my
head
constructed
that
from
measurements
i
took
from
the
fossil
remains
of
the
thermosaurus
in
the
metropolitan
museum
professor
bruce
stoddard
made
the
drawings
we
set
it
up
here
all
ready
to
receive
the
skin
of
the
carcass
that
i
am
expecting
we
had
started
towards
home
walking
slowly
across
the
darkening
dunes
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
sand
was
deep
and
walking
was
not
easy
wish
said
i
at
last
i
knew
why
miss
holroyd
asked
me
not
to
walk
on
the
beach
it
much
less
fatiguing
said
the
professor
a
matter
that
i
intend
to
discuss
with
you
he
spoke
gravely
almost
sadly
i
felt
that
something
of
unparalleled
importance
was
soon
to
be
revealed
so
i
kept
very
quiet
watching
the
ocean
out
of
the
corners
of
my
eyes
xx
dinner
was
ended
daisy
holroyd
lighted
her
father
pipe
for
him
and
insisted
on
my
smoking
as
much
as
i
pleased
then
she
sat
down
and
folded
her
hands
like
a
good
little
girl
waiting
for
her
father
to
make
the
revelation
which
i
felt
in
my
bones
must
be
something
out
of
the
ordinary
the
professor
smoked
for
a
while
gazing
meditatively
at
his
daughter
then
fixing
his
gray
eyes
on
me
he
said
you
ever
heard
of
the
kree
that
australian
bird
half
parrot
half
hawk
that
destroys
so
many
sheep
in
new
south
wales
i
nodded
kree
kills
a
sheep
by
alighting
on
its
back
and
tearing
away
the
flesh
with
its
hooked
beak
until
a
vital
part
is
reached
you
know
that
well
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
kree
had
prehistoric
prototypes
these
birds
were
enormous
creatures
who
preyed
upon
mammoths
and
mastodons
and
even
upon
the
great
saurians
it
has
been
conclusively
proved
that
a
few
saurians
have
been
killed
by
the
ancestors
of
the
kree
but
the
favorite
food
of
these
birds
was
undoubtedly
the
thermosaurus
it
is
believed
that
the
birds
attacked
the
eyes
of
the
thermosaurus
and
when
as
was
its
habit
the
mammoth
creature
turned
on
its
back
to
claw
them
they
fell
upon
the
thinner
scales
of
its
stomach
armor
and
finally
killed
it
this
of
course
is
a
theory
but
we
have
almost
absolute
proofs
of
its
correctness
now
these
two
birds
are
known
among
scientists
as
the
and
the
the
names
are
australian
in
which
country
most
of
their
remains
have
been
unearthed
they
lived
during
the
carboniferous
period
now
it
is
not
generally
known
but
the
fact
is
that
in
captain
ransom
of
the
british
exploring
vessel
purchased
from
the
natives
of
tasmania
the
skin
of
an
that
could
not
have
been
killed
more
than
hours
previous
to
its
sale
i
saw
this
skin
in
the
british
museum
it
was
labelled
unknown
bird
probably
extinct
it
took
me
exactly
a
week
to
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
actually
the
skin
of
an
but
that
is
not
all
dick
continued
the
professor
excitedly
admiral
stuart
of
our
own
navy
saw
the
carcass
of
a
strange
gigantic
bird
floating
along
the
southern
coast
of
australia
sharks
were
after
it
and
before
a
boat
could
be
lowered
these
miserable
fish
got
it
but
the
good
old
admiral
secured
a
few
feathers
and
sent
them
to
the
smithsonian
i
saw
them
they
were
not
even
labelled
but
i
knew
that
they
were
feathers
from
the
or
its
near
relative
the
i
had
grown
so
interested
that
i
had
leaned
far
across
the
table
daisy
too
bent
forward
it
was
only
when
the
professor
paused
for
a
moment
that
i
noticed
how
close
together
our
heads
were
daisy
and
mine
i
do
think
she
realized
it
she
did
not
move
comes
the
important
part
of
this
long
discourse
said
the
professor
smiling
at
our
eagerness
since
the
carcass
of
our
derelict
thermosaurus
was
first
noticed
every
captain
who
has
seen
it
has
also
reported
the
presence
of
one
or
more
gigantic
birds
in
the
neighborhood
these
birds
at
a
great
distance
appeared
to
be
hovering
over
the
carcass
but
on
the
approach
of
a
vessel
they
disappeared
even
in
they
were
observed
when
i
heard
about
it
i
was
puzzled
a
month
later
i
was
satisfied
that
neither
the
nor
the
was
extinct
last
monday
i
knew
that
i
was
right
i
found
distinct
impressions
of
the
huge
claw
of
the
on
the
beach
here
at
pine
inlet
you
may
imagine
my
excitement
i
succeeded
in
digging
up
enough
wet
sand
around
one
of
these
impressions
to
preserve
its
form
i
managed
to
get
it
into
a
and
now
it
is
there
in
my
shop
the
tide
rose
too
rapidly
for
me
to
save
the
other
footprints
i
shuddered
at
the
possibility
of
a
clumsy
misstep
on
my
part
obliterating
the
impression
of
an
is
the
reason
that
my
daughter
warned
you
off
the
beach
he
said
mildly
would
have
been
too
good
for
the
vandal
who
destroyed
such
priceless
prizes
i
cried
out
in
daisy
holroyd
turned
a
flushed
face
to
mine
and
impulsively
laid
her
hand
on
my
sleeve
could
you
know
she
said
all
right
now
said
her
father
emphasizing
each
word
with
a
gentle
tap
of
his
on
the
be
hard
on
yourself
dick
you
do
yeoman
service
yet
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
still
we
chatted
on
about
the
thermosaurus
the
and
the
eagerly
discussing
the
probability
of
the
great
reptile
carcass
being
in
the
vicinity
that
alone
seemed
to
explain
the
presence
of
these
prehistoric
birds
at
pine
inlet
they
ever
attack
human
beings
i
asked
the
professor
looked
startled
he
exclaimed
never
thought
of
that
and
daisy
running
about
dear
me
it
takes
a
scientist
to
be
an
unnatural
parent
his
alarm
was
half
real
half
assumed
but
all
the
same
he
glanced
gravely
at
us
both
shaking
his
handsome
head
absorbed
in
thought
daisy
herself
looked
a
little
doubtful
as
for
me
my
sensations
were
distinctly
queer
is
true
said
the
professor
frowning
at
the
wall
human
remains
have
been
found
associated
with
the
bones
of
the
i
do
know
how
intimately
it
is
a
matter
to
be
taken
into
most
serious
consideration
problem
can
be
solved
said
i
several
ways
one
is
to
keep
miss
holroyd
in
the
house
shall
not
stay
in
cried
daisy
indignantly
we
all
laughed
and
her
father
assured
her
that
she
should
not
be
abused
if
i
did
stay
in
she
said
of
these
birds
might
alight
on
master
dick
she
looked
saucily
at
me
as
she
spoke
but
turned
crimson
when
her
father
observed
quietly
do
seem
to
think
of
me
daisy
course
i
do
she
said
getting
up
and
putting
both
arms
around
her
father
neck
dick
as
as
you
call
him
is
so
helpless
and
timid
my
blissful
smile
froze
on
my
lips
i
repeated
she
came
back
to
the
table
making
me
a
mocking
reverence
you
think
i
am
to
be
laughed
at
with
impunity
she
said
are
your
other
plans
dick
asked
the
professor
let
him
alone
you
little
tease
is
to
haul
a
lot
of
boilers
along
the
dunes
i
said
these
birds
come
when
the
carcass
floats
in
and
if
they
seem
disposed
to
trouble
us
we
could
crawl
into
the
boilers
and
be
safe
that
is
really
brilliant
cried
daisy
quiet
my
child
dick
the
plan
is
sound
and
sensible
and
perfectly
practical
mcpeek
and
frisby
shall
go
for
a
dozen
loads
of
boilers
will
spoil
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
said
daisy
with
a
taunting
nod
to
me
frisby
will
probably
attempt
to
cover
them
with
i
added
laughing
said
daisy
shall
prevent
even
at
the
cost
of
his
life
and
she
stood
up
looking
very
determined
children
protested
the
professor
to
bed
you
bother
me
then
i
turned
deliberately
to
miss

daisy
i
said
dick
she
said
very
gently
xxi
the
week
passed
quickly
for
me
leaving
but
few
definite
impressions
as
i
look
back
to
it
now
i
can
see
the
long
stretch
of
beach
burning
in
the
fierce
sunlight
the
endless
meadows
with
the
glimmer
of
water
in
the
distance
the
dunes
the
twisted
cedars
the
leagues
of
scintillating
ocean
rocking
rocking
always
rocking
in
the
starlit
nights
the
curlew
came
in
from
the
by
twos
and
threes
i
could
hear
their
querulous
call
as
i
lay
in
bed
thinking
all
day
long
the
little
whistled
from
the
shore
the
plover
answered
them
from
distant
lonely
inland
pools
the
great
white
gulls
drifted
like
feathers
upon
the
sea
one
morning
towards
the
end
of
the
week
i
strolling
along
the
dunes
came
upon
frisby
he
was
i
caught
him
said
i
stop
do
you
understand
mr
frisby
he
stepped
back
from
his
work
laying
his
head
on
one
side
considering
first
me
then
the
bill
that
he
had
pasted
on
one
of
our
big
boilers
you
like
the
color
he
asked
goes
well
on
them
black
boilers
no
i
do
like
the
color
either
ca
you
understand
that
there
are
some
people
in
the
world
who
object
to
seeing
advertisements
scattered
over
a
landscape
he
said
perplexed
you
kindly
remove
that
advertisement
i
persisted
late
said
frisby
sot
i
was
too
disgusted
to
speak
but
my
disgust
turned
to
anger
when
i
perceived
that
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
our
boilers
lying
from
three
to
four
hundred
feet
apart
were
ablaze
with
posters
extolling
the
liver
pill
company
do
cost
nothin
said
frisby
cheerfully
done
it
fur
the
fun
of
it
purty
ai
it
are
professor
holroyd
boilers
i
said
subduing
a
desire
to
beat
frisby
with
my
telescope
until
miss
holroyd
sees
this
work
she
like
yeller
and
red
he
demanded
anxiously
find
out
said
i
frisby
gaped
at
his
handiwork
and
then
at
his
yellow
dog
after
a
moment
he
mechanically
spat
on
a
and
requested
davy
to
it
you
comprehend
that
you
have
ruined
our
pleasure
in
the
landscape
i
asked
more
mildly
got
some
green
bills
said
frisby
kin
stick
over
the
yeller
ones
it
said
i
is
the
color
observed
frisby
do
like
them
pills
i
got
some
bills
of
the
cropper
automobile
and
a
few
of
bagley
the
tailor
said
i
them
all
paste
the
whole
collection
over
your
dog
and
yourself
then
walk
off
the
cliff
he
sullenly
unfolded
a
green
poster
swabbed
the
boiler
with
paste
laid
the
upper
section
of
the
bill
upon
it
and
plastered
the
whole
bill
down
with
a
thwack
of
his
brush
as
i
walked
away
i
heard
him
muttering
next
day
daisy
was
so
horrified
that
i
promised
to
give
frisby
an
ultimatum
i
found
him
with
freda
gazing
sentimentally
at
his
work
and
i
sent
him
back
to
the
shop
in
a
hurry
telling
freda
at
the
same
time
that
she
could
spend
her
leisure
in
providing
frisby
with
sand
soap
and
a
then
i
walked
on
to
my
post
of
observation
i
watched
until
sunset
daisy
came
with
her
father
to
hear
my
report
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
and
we
three
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
in
the
evenings
the
professor
worked
on
his
volumes
the
click
of
his
sounding
faintly
behind
his
closed
door
daisy
and
i
played
chess
sometimes
sometimes
we
played
hearts
i
do
remember
that
we
ever
finished
a
game
of
either
we
talked
too
much
our
discussions
covered
every
topic
of
interest
we
argued
upon
politics
we
skimmed
over
literature
and
music
we
settled
international
differences
we
spoke
vaguely
of
human
brotherhood
i
say
we
slighted
no
subject
of
interest
i
am
wrong
we
never
spoke
of
love
now
love
is
a
matter
of
interest
to
ten
people
out
of
ten
why
it
was
that
it
did
not
appear
to
interest
us
is
as
interesting
a
question
as
love
itself
we
were
young
alert
enthusiastic
inquiring
we
eagerly
absorbed
theories
concerning
any
curious
phenomena
in
nature
as
intellectual
cocktails
to
stimulate
discussion
and
yet
we
did
not
discuss
love
i
do
not
say
that
we
avoided
it
no
the
subject
was
too
completely
ignored
for
even
that
and
yet
we
found
it
very
difficult
to
pass
an
hour
separated
the
professor
noticed
this
and
laughed
at
us
we
were
not
even
embarrassed
sunday
passed
in
pious
contemplation
of
the
ocean
daisy
read
a
little
in
her
and
the
professor
threw
a
cloth
over
his
and
strolled
up
and
down
the
sands
he
may
have
been
lost
in
devout
abstraction
he
may
have
been
looking
for
footprints
as
for
me
my
mind
was
very
serene
and
i
was
more
than
happy
daisy
read
to
me
a
little
for
my
soul
sake
and
the
professor
came
up
and
said
something
cheerful
he
also
examined
the
magazine
of
my
winchester
that
night
too
daisy
took
her
guitar
to
the
sands
and
sang
one
or
two
basque
hymns
unlike
us
the
basques
do
not
take
their
pleasures
sadly
one
of
their
pleasures
is
evidently
religion
the
big
moon
came
up
over
the
dunes
and
stared
at
the
sea
until
the
surface
of
every
wave
trembled
with
radiance
a
sudden
stillness
fell
across
the
world
the
wind
died
out
the
foam
ran
noiselessly
across
the
beach
the
cricket
rune
was
stilled
i
leaned
back
dropping
one
hand
upon
the
sand
it
touched
another
hand
soft
and
cool
after
a
while
the
other
hand
moved
slightly
and
i
found
that
my
own
had
closed
above
it
presently
one
finger
stirred
a
little
only
a
little
for
our
fingers
were
interlocked
on
the
shore
the
bubbled
and
winked
and
glimmered
in
the
moonlight
a
star
fell
from
the
zenith
showering
the
night
with
incandescent
dust
if
our
fingers
lay
interlaced
beside
us
her
eyes
were
calm
and
serene
as
always
wide
open
fixed
upon
the
depths
of
a
dark
sky
and
when
her
father
rose
and
spoke
to
us
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
it
late
she
asked
dreamily
is
midnight
little
daughter
i
stood
up
still
holding
her
hand
and
aided
her
to
rise
and
when
at
the
door
i
said
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
for
a
little
while
in
silence
then
passed
into
her
room
slowly
with
head
still
turned
towards
me
all
night
long
i
dreamed
of
her
and
when
the
east
whitened
i
sprang
up
the
thunder
of
the
ocean
in
my
ears
the
strong
blowing
into
the
open
window
asleep
i
thought
and
i
leaned
from
the
window
and
peered
out
into
the
east
the
sea
called
to
me
tossing
its
thousand
arms
the
soaring
gulls
dipping
rising
wheeling
above
the
sandbar
screamed
and
clamored
for
a
playmate
i
slipped
into
my
dropped
from
the
window
upon
the
soft
sand
and
in
a
moment
had
plunged
head
foremost
into
the
surf
swimming
beneath
the
waves
towards
the
open
sea
under
the
tossing
ocean
the
voice
of
the
waters
was
in
my
ears
a
low
sweet
voice
intimate
mysterious
through
singing
foam
and
broad
green
glassy
depths
by
whispering
sandy
channels
atrail
with
and
on
on
out
into
the
vague
cool
sea
i
sped
rising
to
the
top
sinking
gliding
then
at
last
i
flung
myself
out
of
water
hands
raised
and
the
clamor
of
the
gulls
filled
my
ears
as
i
lay
breathing
fast
drifting
on
the
sea
far
out
beyond
the
gulls
i
saw
a
flash
of
white
and
an
arm
was
lifted
signalling
me
i
called
a
clear
hail
came
across
the
water
distinct
on
the
and
at
the
same
instant
we
raised
our
hands
and
moved
towards
each
other
how
we
laughed
as
we
met
in
the
sea
the
white
dawn
came
up
out
of
the
depths
the
zenith
turned
to
rose
and
ashes
and
with
the
dawn
came
the
wind
a
great
fresh
aromatic
that
hurled
our
voices
back
into
our
throats
and
lifted
the
sheeted
spray
above
our
heads
every
wave
crowned
with
mist
caught
us
in
a
cool
embrace
cradled
us
and
slipped
away
only
to
leave
us
to
another
wave
higher
stronger
crested
with
opalescent
glory
breathing
incense
we
turned
together
up
the
coast
swimming
lightly
side
by
side
but
our
words
were
caught
up
by
the
winds
and
whirled
into
the
sky
we
looked
up
at
the
driving
clouds
we
looked
out
upon
the
pallid
waste
of
waters
but
it
was
into
each
other
eyes
we
looked
wondering
wistful
questioning
the
reason
of
sky
and
sea
and
there
in
each
other
eyes
we
read
the
mystery
and
we
knew
that
earth
and
sky
and
sea
were
created
for
us
alone
drifting
on
by
distant
sands
and
dunes
her
white
fingers
touching
mine
we
spoke
keying
our
tones
to
the
wind
vast
harmony
and
we
spoke
of
love
gray
and
wide
as
the
limitless
span
of
the
sky
and
the
sea
the
winds
gathered
from
the
world
ends
to
bear
us
on
but
they
were
not
familiar
winds
for
now
along
the
coast
the
breakers
curled
and
showed
a
million
fangs
and
the
ocean
stirred
to
its
depths
uneasy
ominous
and
the
menace
of
its
murmur
drew
us
closer
as
we
moved
where
the
dull
thunder
and
the
tossing
spray
warned
us
from
sunken
reefs
we
heard
the
harsh
challenges
of
gulls
where
the
pallid
surf
twisted
in
yellow
coils
of
spume
above
the
bar
the
singing
sands
murmured
of
treachery
and
secrets
of
lost
souls
agasp
in
the
throes
of
silent
undertows
but
there
was
a
little
stretch
of
beach
glimmering
through
the
mountains
of
water
and
towards
this
we
turned
side
by
side
around
us
the
water
grew
warmer
the
breath
of
the
following
waves
moistened
our
cheeks
the
water
itself
grew
gray
and
strange
about
us
have
come
too
far
i
said
but
she
only
answered
faster
i
am
afraid
the
water
was
almost
hot
now
its
aromatic
odor
filled
our
lungs
gulf
loop
i
muttered
shall
i
help
you
swim
close
by
me
dick
her
startled
cry
was
echoed
by
another
a
shrill
scream
unutterably
horrible
and
a
great
bird
flapped
from
the
beach
splashing
and
beating
its
pinions
across
the
water
with
a
thundering
noise
out
across
the
waves
it
blundered
rising
little
by
little
from
the
water
and
now
to
my
horror
i
saw
another
monstrous
bird
swinging
in
the
air
above
it
squealing
as
it
turned
on
its
vast
wings
before
i
could
speak
we
touched
the
beach
and
i
half
lifted
her
to
the
shore
i
repeated
must
not
wait
her
eyes
were
dark
with
fear
but
she
rested
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
we
crept
up
among
the
and
sank
down
by
the
point
of
sand
where
the
rough
shelter
stood
surrounded
by
the
piles
she
lay
there
breathing
fast
and
deep
dripping
with
spray
i
had
no
power
of
speech
left
but
when
i
rose
wearily
to
my
knees
and
looked
out
upon
the
water
my
blood
ran
cold
above
the
ocean
on
the
breast
of
the
roaring
wind
three
enormous
birds
sailed
turning
and
wheeling
among
one
another
and
below
drifting
with
the
gray
stream
of
the
gulf
loop
a
colossal
bulk
lay
half
submerged
a
gigantic
lizard
floating
belly
upward
then
daisy
crept
kneeling
to
my
side
and
touched
me
trembling
from
head
to
foot
know
i
muttered
must
run
back
for
the
rifle
and
leave
me
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
we
dragged
ourselves
through
the
to
the
open
end
of
a
boiler
lying
in
the
sand
she
crept
in
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
called
to
me
to
follow
are
safe
now
i
cried
must
go
back
for
the
rifle
birds
may
may
attack
you
they
do
i
can
get
into
one
of
the
other
boilers
i
said
you
must
not
venture
out
until
i
come
back
you
wo
will
you
she
whispered
doubtfully
she
answered
but
her
voice
was
very
small
and
still
i
said
again
i
was
kneeling
at
the
mouth
of
the
big
iron
tunnel
it
was
dark
inside
and
i
could
not
see
her
but
before
i
was
conscious
of
it
her
arms
were
around
my
neck
and
we
had
kissed
each
other
i
do
remember
how
i
went
away
when
i
came
to
my
proper
senses
i
was
swimming
along
the
coast
at
full
speed
and
over
my
head
wheeled
one
of
the
birds
screaming
at
every
turn
the
intoxication
of
that
innocent
embrace
the
close
impress
of
her
arms
around
my
neck
gave
me
a
strength
and
recklessness
that
neither
fear
nor
fatigue
could
subdue
the
bird
above
me
did
not
even
frighten
me
i
watched
it
over
my
shoulder
swimming
strongly
with
the
tide
now
aiding
me
now
stemming
my
course
but
i
saw
the
shore
passing
quickly
and
my
strength
increased
and
i
shouted
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
house
and
scrambled
up
on
the
sand
dripping
and
excited
there
was
nobody
in
sight
and
i
gave
a
last
glance
up
into
the
air
where
the
bird
wheeled
still
screeching
and
hastened
into
the
house
freda
stared
at
me
in
amazement
as
i
seized
the
rifle
and
shouted
for
the
professor
has
just
gone
to
town
with
captain
mcpeek
in
his
wagon
stammered
freda
i
cried
he
know
where
his
daughter
is
holroyd
is
asleep
not
gasped
freda
frisby
i
cried
impatiently
quavered
freda
jimmie
is
there
anybody
here
good
heavens
where
that
man
in
the
shop
also
iss
gone
said
freda
shedding
tears
buy
yimmie
he
iss
gone
to
post
bills
i
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
swung
my
rifle
over
my
shoulder
and
hanging
the
across
my
chest
hurried
out
and
up
the
beach
the
bird
was
not
in
sight
i
had
been
running
for
perhaps
a
minute
when
far
up
on
the
dunes
i
saw
a
yellow
dog
rush
madly
through
a
clump
of
and
at
the
same
moment
a
bird
soared
past
rose
and
hung
hovering
just
above
the
thicket
suddenly
the
bird
swooped
there
was
a
shriek
and
a
yelp
from
the
cur
but
the
bird
gripped
it
in
one
claw
and
beat
its
wings
upon
the
sand
striving
to
rise
then
i
saw
frisby
paste
bucket
and
brush
raised
fall
upon
the
bird
yelling
lustily
the
fierce
creature
relaxed
its
talons
and
the
dog
rushed
on
squeaking
with
terror
the
bird
turned
on
frisby
and
sent
him
sprawling
on
his
face
a
sticky
mass
of
paste
and
sand
but
this
did
not
end
the
struggle
the
bird
croaking
horridly
flew
at
the
prostrate
and
the
sand
whirled
into
a
pillar
above
its
terrible
wings
scarcely
knowing
what
i
was
about
i
raised
my
rifle
and
fired
twice
a
scream
echoed
each
shot
and
the
bird
rose
heavily
in
a
shower
of
sand
but
two
bullets
were
embedded
in
that
mass
of
foul
feathers
and
i
saw
the
wires
and
scarlet
tape
uncoiling
on
the
sand
at
my
feet
in
an
instant
i
seized
them
and
passed
the
ends
around
a
hooking
the
clasps
tight
then
i
cast
one
swift
glance
upward
where
the
bird
wheeled
screeching
anchored
like
a
kite
to
the
pallium
wires
and
i
hurried
on
across
the
dunes
the
shells
cutting
my
feet
and
the
bushes
tearing
my
wet
until
i
dripped
with
blood
from
shoulder
to
ankle
out
in
the
ocean
the
carcass
of
the
thermosaurus
floated
claws
outspread
belly
glistening
in
the
gray
light
and
over
him
circled
two
birds
as
i
reached
the
shelter
i
knelt
and
fired
into
the
mass
of
scales
and
at
my
first
shot
a
horrible
thing
occurred
the
head
writhed
the
slitted
yellow
eyes
sliding
open
from
the
film
that
covered
them
a
shudder
passed
across
the
undulating
body
the
great
scaled
belly
heaved
and
one
leg
feebly
clawed
at
the
air
the
thing
was
still
alive
crushing
back
the
horror
that
almost
paralyzed
my
hands
i
planted
shot
after
shot
into
the
quivering
reptile
while
it
writhed
and
clawed
striving
to
turn
over
and
dive
and
at
each
shot
the
black
blood
spurted
in
long
slim
jets
across
the
water
and
now
daisy
was
at
my
side
pale
and
determined
swiftly
clasping
each
wire
to
the
iron
rings
in
the
circle
around
us
twice
i
filled
the
magazine
from
my
belt
and
twice
i
poured
streams
of
bullets
into
the
scaled
mass
twisting
and
shuddering
on
the
sea
suddenly
the
birds
steered
towards
us
i
felt
the
wind
from
their
vast
wings
i
saw
the
feathers
erect
vibrating
i
saw
the
spread
claws
outstretched
and
i
struck
furiously
at
them
crying
to
daisy
to
run
into
the
iron
shelter
backing
swinging
my
clubbed
rifle
i
retreated
but
i
tripped
across
one
of
the
taut
pallium
wires
and
in
an
instant
the
hideous
birds
were
on
me
and
the
bone
in
my
forearm
snapped
like
a
at
a
blow
from
their
wings
twice
i
struggled
to
my
knees
blinded
with
blood
confused
almost
fainting
then
i
fell
again
rolling
into
the
mouth
of
the
iron
boiler
when
i
struggled
back
to
consciousness
daisy
knelt
silently
beside
me
while
captain
mcpeek
and
professor
holroyd
bound
up
my
shattered
arm
talking
excitedly
the
pain
made
me
faint
and
dizzy
i
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
at
last
they
got
me
to
my
feet
and
into
the
wagon
and
daisy
came
too
and
crouched
beside
me
wrapped
in
oilskins
to
her
eyes
fatigue
lack
of
food
and
excitement
had
combined
with
wounds
and
broken
bones
to
extinguish
the
last
atom
of
strength
in
my
body
but
my
mind
was
clear
enough
to
understand
that
the
trouble
was
over
and
the
thermosaurus
safe
i
heard
mcpeek
say
that
one
of
the
birds
that
i
had
anchored
to
a
had
torn
loose
from
the
bullets
and
had
winged
its
way
heavily
out
to
sea
the
professor
answered
the
the
others
were
i
have
given
my
right
arm
to
have
secured
them
then
for
a
time
i
heard
no
more
but
the
jolting
of
the
wagon
over
the
dunes
roused
me
to
keenest
pain
and
i
held
out
my
right
hand
to
daisy
she
clasped
it
in
both
of
hers
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
there
is
little
more
to
add
i
think
professor
bruce
scientific
pamphlet
will
be
published
soon
to
be
followed
by
professor
holroyd
sixteen
volumes
in
a
few
days
the
stuffed
and
mounted
thermosaurus
will
be
placed
on
free
public
exhibition
in
the
arena
of
madison
square
garden
the
only
building
in
the
city
large
enough
to
contain
the
body
of
this
immense
winged
reptile
the
young
man
hesitated
looking
long
and
earnestly
at
miss
barrison
did
you
marry
her
she
asked
softly
you
would
believe
it
said
the
young
man
earnestly
you
would
believe
it
after
all
that
happened
if
i
should
tell
you
that
she
married
professor
bruce
stoddard
of
columbia
would
you
yes
i
would
said
miss
barrison
you
never
can
tell
what
a
girl
will
do
that
story
of
yours
i
said
is
to
me
the
most
wonderful
and
valuable
contribution
to
nature
study
that
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
listen
to
you
are
fitted
to
write
it
is
your
sacred
mission
to
produce
are
you
going
to
i
am
writing
said
the
young
man
quietly
a
nature
book
sir
peter
grebe
magnificent
monograph
on
the
speckled
titmouse
inspired
me
but
nature
study
is
not
what
i
have
chosen
as
my
life
mission
he
looked
dreamily
across
at
miss
barrison
no
not
natural
phenomena
he
repeated
but
unnatural
phenomena
what
professor
hyssop
has
done
for
columbia
i
shall
attempt
to
do
for
harvard
in
fact
i
have
already
accepted
the
chair
of
psychical
phenomena
at
cambridge
i
gazed
upon
him
with
intense
respect
a
personal
experience
revealed
to
me
my
life
work
he
went
on
thoughtfully
stroking
his
blond
mustache
if
miss
barrison
would
care
to
hear
it
please
tell
it
she
said
sweetly
i
shall
have
to
relate
it
clothed
in
that
artificial
garb
known
as
literary
style
he
explained
deprecatingly
it
does
matter
i
said
i
never
noticed
any
style
at
all
in
your
story
of
the
thermosaurus
he
smiled
gratefully
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
a
expression
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
slowly
began
hesitating
as
though
talking
to
himself
xxii
it
was
high
noon
in
the
city
of
antwerp
from
slender
steeples
floated
the
mellow
music
of
the
flemish
bells
and
in
the
spire
of
the
great
cathedral
across
the
square
the
cracked
chimes
clashed
discords
until
my
ears
ached
when
the
fiend
in
the
cathedral
had
jerked
the
last
tuneless
clang
from
the
chimes
i
removed
my
fingers
from
my
ears
and
sat
down
at
one
of
the
iron
tables
in
the
court
a
waiter
with
his
face
shaved
blue
brought
me
a
bottle
of
rhine
wine
a
tumbler
of
cracked
ice
and
a
siphon
monsieur
desire
anything
else
he
inquired
the
head
of
the
cathedral
bring
it
with
vinegar
and
potatoes
i
said
bitterly
then
i
began
to
ponder
on
my
and
the
crimson
diamond
the
white
walls
of
the
hôtel
antoine
rose
in
a
rectangle
around
the
sunny
court
casting
long
shadows
across
the
basin
of
the
fountain
the
strip
of
blue
overhead
was
cloudless
sparrows
twittered
under
the
eaves
the
yellow
awnings
fluttered
the
flowers
swayed
in
the
summer
breeze
and
the
jet
of
the
fountain
splashed
among
the
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
piazza
the
tables
were
vacant
on
the
shady
side
i
was
lazily
aware
that
the
tables
behind
me
were
occupied
but
i
was
indifferent
as
to
their
occupants
partly
because
i
shunned
all
tourists
partly
because
i
was
thinking
of
my
most
old
ladies
are
eccentric
but
there
is
a
limit
and
my
had
overstepped
it
i
had
believed
her
to
be
wealthy
she
died
bankrupt
still
i
knew
there
was
one
thing
she
did
possess
and
that
was
the
famous
crimson
diamond
now
of
course
you
know
who
my
was
excepting
the
and
the
regent
this
enormous
and
unique
stone
was
as
everybody
knows
the
most
valuable
gem
in
existence
any
ordinary
person
would
have
placed
that
diamond
in
a
my
did
nothing
of
the
kind
she
kept
it
in
a
small
velvet
bag
which
she
carried
about
her
neck
she
never
took
it
off
but
wore
it
dangling
openly
on
her
heavy
silk
gown
in
this
same
bag
she
also
carried
dried
of
which
she
was
inordinately
fond
nobody
but
myself
her
only
living
relative
knew
that
the
crimson
diamond
lay
among
the
sprigs
of
catnip
in
the
little
velvet
bag
she
would
say
you
think
i
a
fool
if
i
place
the
crimson
diamond
in
any
vault
in
new
york
somebody
will
steal
it
sooner
or
later
then
she
would
nibble
a
sprig
of
catnip
and
peer
cunningly
at
me
i
loathed
the
odor
of
catnip
and
she
knew
it
i
also
loathed
cats
this
also
she
knew
and
of
course
surrounded
herself
with
a
dozen
poor
old
lady
one
day
she
was
found
dead
in
her
bed
in
her
apartments
at
the
waldorf
the
doctor
said
she
died
from
natural
causes
the
only
other
occupant
of
her
was
a
cat
the
cat
fled
when
we
broke
open
the
door
and
i
heard
that
she
was
received
and
cherished
by
some
eccentric
people
in
a
neighboring
apartment
now
although
my
death
was
due
to
purely
natural
causes
there
was
one
very
startling
and
disagreeable
feature
of
the
case
the
velvet
bag
containing
the
crimson
diamond
had
disappeared
every
inch
of
the
apartment
was
searched
the
floors
torn
up
the
walls
dismantled
but
the
crimson
diamond
had
vanished
chief
of
police
conlon
detailed
four
of
his
best
men
on
the
case
and
as
i
had
nothing
better
to
do
i
enrolled
myself
as
a
volunteer
i
also
offered
reward
for
the
recovery
of
the
gem
all
new
york
was
agog
the
case
seemed
hopeless
enough
although
there
were
five
of
us
after
the
thief
mcfarlane
was
in
london
and
had
been
for
a
month
but
scotland
yard
could
give
him
no
help
and
the
last
i
heard
of
him
he
was
roaming
through
surrey
after
a
man
with
a
white
spot
in
his
hair
harrison
had
gone
to
paris
he
kept
writing
me
that
clews
were
plenty
and
the
scent
hot
but
as
dennet
in
berlin
and
clancy
in
vienna
wrote
me
the
same
thing
i
began
to
doubt
these
gentlemen
ability
say
i
answered
harrison
the
fellow
is
a
frenchman
and
that
he
is
now
concealed
in
paris
but
dennet
writes
me
by
the
same
mail
that
the
thief
is
undoubtedly
a
german
and
was
seen
yesterday
in
berlin
i
received
a
letter
from
clancy
assuring
me
that
vienna
holds
the
culprit
and
that
he
is
an
austrian
from
trieste
now
for
heaven
sake
i
ended
me
alone
and
stop
writing
me
letters
until
you
have
something
to
write
about
the
at
the
waldorf
had
furnished
us
with
our
first
clew
on
the
night
of
my
aunt
death
he
had
seen
a
tall
man
hurriedly
leave
the
hotel
as
the
man
passed
the
desk
he
removed
his
hat
and
mopped
his
forehead
and
the
noticed
that
in
the
middle
of
his
head
there
was
a
patch
of
hair
as
white
as
snow
we
worked
this
clew
for
all
it
was
worth
and
a
month
later
i
received
a
cable
despatch
from
paris
saying
that
a
man
answering
to
the
description
of
the
waldorf
suspect
had
offered
an
enormous
crimson
diamond
for
sale
to
a
jeweller
in
the
palais
royal
unfortunately
the
fellow
took
fright
and
disappeared
before
the
jeweller
could
send
for
the
police
and
since
that
time
mcfarlane
in
london
harrison
in
paris
dennet
in
berlin
and
clancy
in
vienna
had
been
chasing
men
with
white
patches
on
their
hair
until
no
patriarch
in
europe
was
free
from
suspicion
i
myself
had
sleuthed
it
through
england
france
holland
and
belgium
and
now
i
found
myself
in
antwerp
at
the
hôtel
antoine
without
a
clew
that
promised
anything
except
another
outrage
on
some
respectable
citizen
the
case
seemed
hopeless
enough
unless
the
thief
tried
again
to
sell
the
gem
here
was
our
only
hope
for
unless
he
cut
the
stone
into
smaller
ones
he
had
no
more
chance
of
selling
it
than
he
would
have
had
if
he
had
stolen
the
venus
of
milo
and
peddled
her
about
the
rue
de
seine
even
were
he
to
cut
up
the
stone
no
respectable
gem
collector
or
jeweller
would
buy
a
crimson
diamond
without
first
notifying
me
for
although
a
few
red
stones
are
known
to
collectors
the
color
of
the
crimson
diamond
was
absolutely
unique
and
there
was
little
probability
of
an
honest
mistake
thinking
of
all
these
things
i
sat
sipping
my
rhine
wine
in
the
shadow
of
the
yellow
awnings
a
large
white
cat
came
sauntering
by
and
stopped
in
front
of
me
to
perform
her
toilet
until
i
wished
she
would
go
away
after
a
while
she
sat
up
licked
her
whiskers
yawned
once
or
twice
and
was
about
to
stroll
on
when
catching
sight
of
me
she
stopped
short
and
looked
me
squarely
in
the
face
i
returned
the
attention
with
a
scowl
because
i
wished
to
discourage
any
advances
towards
social
intercourse
which
she
might
contemplate
but
after
a
while
her
steady
gaze
disconcerted
me
and
i
turned
to
my
rhine
wine
a
few
minutes
later
i
looked
up
again
the
cat
was
still
eying
me
what
the
devil
is
the
matter
with
the
animal
i
muttered
she
recognize
in
me
a
relative
observed
a
man
at
the
next
table
do
you
mean
by
that
i
demanded
i
say
replied
the
man
at
the
next
table
i
looked
him
full
in
the
face
he
was
old
and
bald
and
appeared
his
age
protected
his
impudence
i
turned
my
back
on
him
then
my
eyes
fell
on
the
cat
again
she
was
still
gazing
earnestly
at
me
disgusted
that
she
should
take
such
pointed
public
notice
of
me
i
wondered
whether
other
people
saw
it
i
wondered
whether
there
was
anything
peculiar
in
my
own
personal
appearance
how
hard
the
creature
stared
it
was
most
embarrassing
has
got
into
that
cat
i
thought
sheer
impudence
an
intrusion
and
i
wo
stand
it
the
cat
did
not
move
i
tried
to
stare
her
out
of
countenance
it
was
useless
there
was
aggressive
inquiry
in
her
yellow
eyes
a
sensation
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
me
a
sensation
of
embarrassment
not
unmixed
with
awe
all
cats
looked
alike
to
me
and
yet
there
was
something
about
this
one
that
bothered
me
something
that
i
could
not
explain
to
myself
but
which
began
to
occupy
me
she
looked
familiar
this
antwerp
cat
an
odd
sense
of
having
seen
her
before
of
having
been
well
acquainted
with
her
in
former
years
slowly
settled
in
my
mind
and
although
i
could
never
remember
the
time
when
i
had
not
detested
cats
i
was
almost
convinced
that
my
relations
with
this
antwerp
tabby
had
once
been
intimate
if
not
cordial
i
looked
more
closely
at
the
animal
then
an
idea
struck
me
an
idea
which
persisted
and
took
definite
shape
in
spite
of
me
i
strove
to
escape
from
it
to
evade
it
to
stifle
and
smother
it
an
inward
struggle
ensued
which
brought
the
perspiration
in
beads
upon
my
cheeks
a
struggle
short
sharp
decisive
it
was
useless
useless
to
try
to
put
it
from
me
this
idea
so
wretchedly
bizarre
so
grotesque
and
fantastic
so
utterly
inane
it
was
useless
to
deny
that
the
cat
bore
a
distinct
resemblance
to
my
i
gazed
at
her
in
horror
what
enormous
eyes
the
creature
had
is
thicker
than
water
said
the
man
at
the
next
table
does
he
mean
by
that
i
muttered
angrily
swallowing
a
tumbler
of
rhine
wine
and
seltzer
but
i
did
not
turn
what
was
the
use
old
imbecile
i
added
to
myself
and
struck
a
match
for
my
cigar
was
out
but
as
i
raised
the
match
to
relight
it
i
encountered
the
cat
eyes
again
i
could
not
enjoy
my
cigar
with
the
animal
staring
at
me
but
i
was
justly
indignant
and
i
did
not
intend
to
be
routed
idea
forced
to
leave
for
a
cat
i
sneered
will
see
who
will
be
the
one
to
go
i
tried
to
give
her
a
jet
of
seltzer
from
the
siphon
but
the
bottle
was
too
nearly
empty
to
carry
far
then
i
attempted
to
lure
her
nearer
calling
her
in
french
german
and
english
but
she
did
not
stir
i
did
not
know
the
flemish
for
got
a
name
and
wo
come
i
thought
what
under
the
sun
can
i
call
her
suggested
the
man
at
the
next
table
i
sat
perfectly
still
could
that
man
have
answered
my
thoughts
for
i
had
not
spoken
aloud
of
course
not
it
was
a
coincidence
but
a
very
disgusting
one
i
repeated
mechanically
aunty
good
gracious
how
horribly
human
that
cat
looks
then
somehow
or
other
words
crept
into
my
head
and
i
found
myself
repeating
soul
of
my
grandam
might
haply
inhabit
a
bird
the
soul
of
nonsense
i
growled
is
printed
correctly
one
might
possibly
say
speaking
in
poetical
metaphor
that
the
soul
of
a
bird
might
haply
inhabit
one
grandam
i
stopped
short
flushing
painfully
awful
rot
i
murmured
and
lighted
another
cigar
the
cat
was
still
staring
the
cigar
went
out
i
grew
more
and
more
nervous
rot
i
repeated
must
have
been
an
ass
but
i
do
believe
there
are
plenty
of
asses
alive
who
swallow
that
sort
of
thing
knows
sighed
the
man
at
the
next
table
and
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
wheeled
about
but
i
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pair
of
frayed
and
a
bald
head
vanishing
into
the
i
sat
down
again
thoroughly
indignant
a
moment
later
the
cat
got
up
and
went
away
xxiii
daylight
was
fading
in
the
city
of
antwerp
down
into
the
sea
sank
the
sun
tinting
the
vast
horizon
with
flakes
of
crimson
and
touching
with
rich
deep
undertones
the
tossing
waters
of
the
scheldt
its
glow
fell
like
a
rosy
mantle
over
roofs
and
meadows
and
through
the
haze
the
spires
of
twenty
churches
pierced
the
air
like
sharp
gilded
flames
to
the
west
and
south
the
green
plains
over
which
the
spanish
armies
tramped
so
long
ago
stretched
away
until
they
met
the
sky
the
enchantment
of
the
had
turned
old
antwerp
into
and
sea
and
sky
and
plain
were
beautiful
and
vague
as
the
floating
in
the
moats
below
along
the
from
the
rubens
gate
all
antwerp
strolled
and
chattered
and
flirted
and
sipped
their
flemish
wines
from
slender
flemish
glasses
or
gossiped
over
krugs
of
foaming
beer
from
the
scheldt
came
the
cries
of
sailors
the
creaking
of
cordage
and
the
puff
puff
of
the
on
the
bastions
of
the
fortress
opposite
a
bugler
was
standing
twice
the
mellow
notes
of
the
bugle
came
faintly
over
the
water
then
a
great
gun
thundered
from
the
ramparts
and
the
belgian
flag
fluttered
along
the
lanyards
to
the
ground
i
leaned
listlessly
on
the
and
looked
down
at
the
scheldt
below
a
battery
of
artillery
was
embarking
for
the
fortress
the
tublike
transport
lay
hissing
and
whistling
in
the
slip
and
the
stamping
of
horses
the
rumbling
of
gun
and
caisson
and
the
sharp
cries
of
the
officers
came
plainly
to
the
ear
when
the
last
caisson
was
aboard
and
stowed
and
the
last
trooper
had
sprung
jingling
to
the
deck
the
transport
puffed
out
into
the
scheldt
and
i
turned
away
through
the
throng
of
promenaders
and
found
a
little
table
on
the
terrace
just
outside
of
the
pretty
café
and
as
i
sat
down
i
became
aware
of
a
girl
at
the
next
table
a
girl
all
in
white
the
most
ravishingly
and
distractingly
pretty
girl
that
i
had
ever
seen
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
i
forgot
my
name
my
fortune
my
aunt
and
the
crimson
diamond
all
these
i
forgot
in
a
purely
human
impulse
to
see
clearly
and
to
that
end
i
removed
my
monocle
from
my
left
eye
some
moments
later
i
came
to
myself
and
feebly
replaced
it
it
was
too
late
the
mischief
was
done
i
was
not
aware
at
first
of
the
exact
state
of
my
feelings
for
i
had
never
been
in
love
more
than
three
or
four
times
in
all
my
life
but
i
did
know
that
at
her
request
i
would
have
been
proud
to
stand
on
my
head
or
turn
a
into
the
scheldt
i
did
not
stare
at
her
but
i
managed
to
see
her
most
of
the
time
when
her
eyes
were
in
another
direction
i
found
myself
drinking
something
which
a
waiter
brought
presumably
upon
an
order
which
i
did
not
remember
having
given
later
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
loathsome
drink
which
the
belgians
call
grog
but
i
swallowed
it
and
lighted
a
cigarette
as
the
fragrant
cloud
rose
in
the
air
a
voice
which
i
recognized
with
a
chill
broke
into
my
dream
of
enchantment
could
have
been
there
all
the
while
there
sitting
beside
that
vision
in
white
his
hat
was
off
and
the
whispered
about
his
bald
head
his
frayed
were
folded
carefully
over
his
knees
and
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
he
balanced
a
bad
cigar
he
looked
at
me
in
a
mildly
cheerful
way
and
said
know
now
what
i
asked
thinking
it
better
to
humor
him
for
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
mad
know
why
cats
bite
this
was
startling
i
had
an
idea
what
to
say
know
why
he
repeated
you
guess
why
there
was
a
covert
tone
of
triumph
in
his
voice
and
he
smiled
encouragement
try
and
guess
he
urged
i
told
him
that
i
was
unequal
to
problems
young
man
he
continued
folding
his
closely
about
his
legs
to
reason
it
out
why
should
cats
bite
do
you
know
i
do
he
looked
at
me
anxiously
take
no
interest
in
this
problem
he
demanded
yes
why
do
you
not
ask
me
why
he
said
looking
vaguely
disappointed
i
said
in
desperation
do
cats
bite
hang
it
all
i
thought
like
a
show
and
i
bones
and
tambo
then
he
smiled
gently
man
he
said
bite
because
they
feed
on
catnip
i
have
reasoned
it
out
i
stared
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
was
this
old
party
poking
fun
at
me
was
he
paying
me
up
for
the
snub
was
he
a
malignant
and
revengeful
old
party
or
was
he
merely
who
might
he
be
what
was
he
doing
here
in
antwerp
what
was
he
doing
now
for
the
bald
one
had
turned
familiarly
to
the
beautiful
girl
in
white
he
said
you
feel
chilly
the
girl
shook
her
head
in
the
least
papa
father
i
thought
father
thank
god
she
did
not
say
have
been
to
the
zoo
announced
the
bald
one
turning
towards
me
indeed
i
observed
i
trust
you
enjoyed
it
have
been
contemplating
the
apes
he
continued
dreamily
contemplating
the
apes
i
tried
to
look
interested
the
apes
he
murmured
fixing
his
mild
eyes
on
me
then
he
leaned
towards
me
confidentially
and
whispered
you
tell
me
what
a
monkey
thinks
can
not
i
replied
sharply
he
sighed
sinking
back
in
his
chair
and
patting
the
slender
hand
of
the
girl
beside
him
who
can
tell
what
a
monkey
thinks
his
gentle
face
lulled
my
suspicions
and
i
replied
very
gravely
can
tell
whether
they
think
at
all
true
who
can
tell
whether
they
think
at
all
and
if
they
do
think
ah
who
can
tell
what
they
think
i
began
you
ca
tell
whether
they
think
at
all
the
use
of
trying
to
conjecture
what
they
think
if
they
think
he
raised
his
hand
in
deprecation
it
is
exactly
that
which
is
of
such
absorbing
interest
exactly
that
it
is
the
abstruseness
of
the
proposition
which
stimulates
research
which
stirs
profoundly
the
brain
of
the
thinking
world
the
question
is
of
vital
and
instant
importance
possibly
you
have
already
formed
an
opinion
i
admitted
that
i
had
thought
but
little
on
the
subject
doubt
he
continued
swathing
his
knees
in
his
doubt
whether
you
have
given
much
attention
to
the
subject
lately
discussed
by
the
boston
dodo
society
of
pythagorean
research
am
not
sure
i
said
politely
i
recall
that
particular
discussion
may
i
ask
what
was
the
question
brought
up
felis
domestica
question
that
must
indeed
be
interesting
and
er
what
may
be
the
felis
do
do
not
dodo
felis
domestica
the
common
or
garden
cat
i
murmured
are
not
listening
he
said
i
only
half
heard
him
i
could
not
turn
my
eyes
from
his
face
shouted
the
bald
one
and
i
almost
leaped
from
my
chair
you
deaf
he
inquired
sympathetically
oh
no
i
replied
coloring
with
confusion
were
pardon
me
you
were
er
speaking
of
the
dodo
extraordinary
bird
that
was
not
discussing
the
dodo
he
sighed
was
speaking
of
cats
course
i
said
question
is
he
continued
twisting
his
frayed
into
a
sort
of
rope
question
is
how
are
we
to
ameliorate
the
present
condition
and
social
status
of
our
domestic
cats
i
suggested
he
raised
both
hands
they
were
eloquent
with
patient
expostulation
mean
their
spiritual
condition
he
said
i
nodded
but
my
eyes
reverted
to
that
exquisite
face
she
sat
silent
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
waning
flecks
of
color
in
the
western
sky
repeated
the
bald
one
spiritual
welfare
of
our
domestic
cats
and
tabbies
i
murmured
he
said
tying
a
large
knot
in
his
will
ruin
your
coat
i
observed
exclaimed
the
girl
turning
in
dismay
as
that
gentleman
gave
a
guilty
start
it
at
once
he
smiled
apologetically
and
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
conceal
his
dear
he
said
with
gentle
deprecation
am
so
i
always
do
it
in
the
heat
of
argument
the
girl
rose
and
bending
over
her
untidy
parent
deftly
untied
the
knot
in
his
flapping
coat
when
he
was
disentangled
she
sat
down
and
said
with
a
ghost
of
a
smile
is
so
very
father
is
evidently
a
great
student
i
ventured
pleasantly
how
i
pitied
her
tied
to
this
old
lunatic
he
is
a
great
student
she
said
quietly
am
he
murmured
what
makes
me
so
i
often
go
to
bed
and
forget
to
sleep
then
looking
at
me
he
asked
me
my
name
adding
with
a
bow
that
his
name
was
royal
wyeth
professor
of
pythagorean
research
and
abstruse
paradox
first
name
is
penny
named
after
professor
penny
of
harvard
he
said
i
seldom
use
my
first
name
in
connection
with
my
second
as
the
combination
suggests
a
household
remedy
of
penetrating
odor
name
is
kensett
i
said
kensett
of
new
york
a
little
of
diamonds
i
smiled
i
see
you
know
who
my
was
i
said
know
her
he
said
perhaps
you
are
unaware
that
my
is
not
now
living
know
her
he
repeated
obstinately
i
bowed
what
a
crank
he
was
do
you
study
you
do
fiddle
away
all
your
time
do
you
he
asked
now
that
was
just
what
i
did
but
i
was
not
pleased
to
have
miss
wyeth
know
it
although
my
time
was
chiefly
spent
in
killing
time
i
had
once
in
a
fit
of
energy
succeeded
in
writing
some
verses
a
tomtit
so
i
evaded
a
humiliating
confession
by
saying
that
i
had
done
a
little
work
in
ornithology
cried
the
professor
beaming
all
over
knew
you
were
a
possibly
you
are
a
of
the
boston
dodo
society
of
pythagorean
research
are
you
a
dodo
i
shook
my
head
i
am
not
a
dodo
a
jay
what
i
said
angrily
jay
we
call
the
members
of
the
junior
ornithological
jay
society
of
new
york
jays
just
as
we
refer
to
ourselves
as
dodos
are
you
not
even
a
jay
am
not
i
said
watching
him
suspiciously
must
convert
you
i
see
said
the
professor
smiling
afraid
i
do
not
approve
of
pythagorean
research
i
began
but
the
beautiful
miss
wyeth
turned
to
me
very
seriously
and
looking
me
frankly
in
the
eyes
said
trust
you
will
be
open
to
conviction
lord
i
thought
she
be
another
lunatic
i
looked
at
her
steadily
what
a
little
beauty
she
was
she
also
then
belonged
to
the
pythagoreans
a
sect
i
despised
everybody
knows
all
about
the
pythagorean
craze
its
rise
in
boston
its
rapid
spread
and
its
subsequent
consolidation
with
mental
and
christian
science
theosophy
hypnotism
the
salvation
army
the
shakers
the
dunkards
and
the
cult
upon
a
business
basis
i
had
hitherto
regarded
all
pythagoreans
with
the
same
scornful
indifference
which
i
accorded
to
the
being
a
member
of
no
particular
church
i
was
scarcely
prepared
to
take
any
of
them
seriously
least
of
all
did
i
approve
of
the
basis
and
i
looked
very
much
askance
indeed
at
the
and
religious
trust
company
duly
incorporated
and
generally
known
as
the
pythagorean
trust
which
consolidating
with
and
other
flourishing
salvation
syndicates
actually
claimed
a
place
among
ordinary
trusts
and
at
the
same
time
pretended
to
a
control
over
man
future
life
no
i
could
never
listen
i
was
ashamed
of
even
entertaining
the
notion
and
i
shook
my
head
miss
wyeth
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
care
to
listen
to
any
reasoning
on
this
subject
you
believe
in
pythagoras
demanded
the
professor
subduing
his
excitement
with
difficulty
and
adding
another
knot
to
his
i
said
do
not
do
you
know
you
do
inquired
the
professor
i
said
firmly
is
nonsense
to
say
that
the
soul
of
a
human
being
can
inhabit
a
hen
it
in
a
more
simplified
form
insisted
the
professor
you
believe
that
the
soul
of
a
hen
can
inhabit
a
human
being
i
do
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
cried
the
professor
his
voice
ending
in
a
shout
i
nodded
intensely
annoyed
you
listen
to
reason
then
he
continued
eagerly
i
began
but
i
caught
miss
wyeth
blue
eyes
fixed
on
mine
with
an
expression
so
sad
so
sweetly
appealing
that
i
faltered
i
will
listen
i
said
faintly
you
become
my
pupil
insisted
the
professor
i
was
shocked
to
find
myself
wavering
but
my
eyes
were
looking
into
hers
and
i
could
not
disobey
what
i
read
there
the
longer
i
looked
the
greater
inclination
i
felt
to
waver
i
saw
that
i
was
going
to
give
in
and
strangest
of
all
my
conscience
did
not
trouble
me
i
felt
it
coming
a
sort
of
mild
exhilaration
took
possession
of
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
became
reckless
i
even
gloried
in
my
recklessness
yes
i
cried
leaning
eagerly
across
the
table
shall
be
glad
delighted
will
you
take
me
as
your
pupil
my
single
fell
from
its
position
unheeded
me
oh
will
you
take
me
i
cried
instead
of
answering
the
professor
blinked
rapidly
at
me
for
a
moment
i
imagined
his
eyes
had
grown
bigger
and
were
assuming
a
greenish
tinge
the
corners
of
his
mouth
began
to
quiver
emitting
queer
caressing
little
noises
and
he
rapidly
added
knot
after
knot
to
his
twitching
suddenly
he
bent
forward
across
the
table
until
his
nose
almost
touched
mine
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
expanded
the
iris
assuming
a
beautiful
changing
tinge
and
his
switched
violently
then
he
began
to
mew
i
strove
to
rouse
myself
from
my
paralysis
i
tried
to
shrink
back
for
i
felt
the
end
of
his
cold
nose
touch
mine
i
could
not
move
the
cry
of
terror
died
in
my
straining
throat
my
hands
tightened
convulsively
i
was
incapable
of
speech
or
motion
at
the
same
time
my
brain
became
wonderfully
clear
i
began
to
remember
everything
that
had
ever
happened
to
me
everything
that
i
had
ever
done
or
said
i
even
remembered
things
that
i
had
neither
done
nor
said
i
recalled
distinctly
much
that
had
never
happened
how
fresh
and
strong
my
memory
the
past
was
like
a
mirror
crystal
clear
and
there
in
glorious
tints
and
hues
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
grew
and
glowed
and
faded
and
gave
place
to
newer
and
more
splendid
scenes
for
a
moment
the
episode
of
the
cat
at
the
hôtel
antoine
flashed
across
my
mind
when
it
vanished
a
chilly
stupor
slowly
clouded
my
brain
the
scenes
the
memories
the
brilliant
colors
faded
leaving
me
enveloped
in
a
gray
vapor
through
which
the
two
great
eyes
of
the
professor
twinkled
with
a
murky
light
a
peculiar
longing
stirred
me
a
strange
yearning
for
something
i
knew
not
what
but
oh
how
i
longed
and
yearned
for
it
slowly
this
indefinite
incomprehensible
longing
became
a
living
pain
ah
how
i
suffered
and
how
the
vapors
seemed
to
crowd
around
me
then
as
at
a
great
distance
i
heard
her
voice
sweet
imperative
she
said
for
a
moment
i
seemed
to
see
the
interior
of
my
own
skull
lighted
as
by
a
flash
of
fire
the
rolling
eyeballs
veined
in
scarlet
the
glistening
muscles
quivering
along
the
jaw
the
humid
masses
of
the
convoluted
brain
then
awful
darkness
a
darkness
almost
tangible
an
utter
blackness
through
which
now
seemed
to
creep
a
thin
silver
thread
like
a
river
crawling
across
a
world
like
a
thought
gliding
to
the
brain
like
a
song
a
thin
sharp
song
which
some
distant
voice
was
singing
which
i
was
singing
and
i
knew
that
i
was
mewing
i
threw
myself
back
in
my
chair
and
mewed
with
all
my
heart
oh
that
heavy
load
which
was
lifted
from
my
breast
how
good
how
satisfying
it
was
to
mew
and
how
i
did
miaul
and
yowl
i
gave
myself
up
to
it
heart
and
soul
my
whole
being
thrilled
with
the
passionate
outpourings
of
a
spirit
freed
my
voice
trembled
in
the
upper
bars
of
a
feline
quavered
descended
swelling
again
into
an
intimation
that
i
brooked
no
rival
and
ended
with
a
magnificent
crescendo
i
finished
somewhat
abashed
and
glanced
askance
at
the
professor
and
his
daughter
but
the
one
sat
nonchalantly
disentangling
his
and
the
other
was
apparently
absorbed
in
the
distant
landscape
evidently
they
did
not
consider
me
ridiculous
flushing
painfully
i
turned
in
my
chair
to
see
how
my
grewsome
solo
had
affected
the
people
on
the
terrace
nobody
even
looked
at
me
this
however
gave
me
little
comfort
for
as
i
began
to
realize
what
i
had
done
my
mortification
and
rage
knew
no
bounds
i
was
ready
to
die
of
shame
what
on
earth
had
induced
me
to
mew
i
looked
wildly
about
for
escape
i
would
leap
up
rush
home
to
bury
my
burning
face
in
my
pillows
and
later
in
the
friendly
cabin
of
a
steamer
i
would
fly
fly
at
once
woe
to
the
man
who
blocked
my
way
i
started
to
my
feet
but
at
that
moment
i
caught
miss
wyeth
eyes
fixed
on
mine
go
she
said
what
in
heaven
name
lay
in
those
blue
eyes
i
slowly
sank
back
into
my
chair
then
the
professor
spoke
i
have
just
received
a
despatch
from
papa
india
i
going
at
once
she
nodded
her
head
without
turning
her
eyes
from
the
sea
it
important
papa
should
say
so
the
cashier
of
the
local
trust
has
compromised
an
astral
body
and
has
squandered
on
her
all
our
funds
including
a
lot
of
first
mortgages
on
nirvana
i
suppose
he
been
dabbling
in
futures
and
is
short
in
his
accounts
i
be
gone
long
papa
she
said
kissing
him
to
be
back
by
eleven
i
sat
stupidly
staring
at
them
it
only
to
bombay
i
go
to
thibet
my
dear
said
the
professor
then
a
singular
thing
occurred
the
professor
had
at
last
succeeded
in
disentangling
his
and
now
jamming
his
hat
over
his
ears
and
waving
his
arms
with
a
batlike
motion
he
climbed
upon
the
seat
of
his
chair
and
ejaculated
the
word
then
i
found
my
voice
him
i
cried
in
terror
presto
shouted
the
professor
balancing
himself
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
waving
his
arms
majestically
as
if
preparing
for
a
sudden
flight
across
the
scheldt
and
firmly
convinced
that
he
not
only
meditated
it
but
was
perfectly
capable
of
attempting
it
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hands
you
ill
mr
kensett
asked
the
girl
quietly
i
raised
my
head
indignantly
at
all
miss
wyeth
only
i
bid
you
for
this
is
the
nineteenth
century
and
i
a
christian
am
i
she
said
is
my
father
devil
he
is
i
thought
her
next
words
made
me
jump
do
not
be
profane
mr
kensett
how
did
she
know
i
was
profane
i
had
not
spoken
a
word
could
it
be
possible
she
was
able
to
read
my
thoughts
this
was
too
much
and
i
rose
have
the
honor
to
bid
you
i
began
and
reluctantly
turned
to
include
the
professor
expecting
to
see
that
gentleman
balancing
himself
on
his
chair
the
professor
chair
was
empty
said
the
girl
smiling
father
has
gone
where
to
india
i
believe
i
sank
helplessly
into
my
own
chair
do
not
think
he
will
stay
very
long
he
promised
to
return
by
eleven
she
said
timidly
i
tried
to
realize
the
purport
of
it
all
to
india
gone
how
on
a
broomstick
good
heavens
i
murmured
i
insane
she
said
i
am
tired
you
may
take
me
back
to
the
hotel
i
scarcely
heard
her
i
was
feebly
attempting
to
gather
up
my
numbed
wits
slowly
i
began
to
comprehend
the
situation
to
review
the
startling
and
humiliating
events
of
the
day
at
noon
in
the
court
of
the
hôtel
antoine
i
had
been
annoyed
by
a
man
and
a
cat
i
had
retired
to
my
own
room
and
had
slept
until
dinner
in
the
evening
i
met
two
tourists
on
the
promenade
i
had
been
beguiled
into
conversation
yes
into
intimacy
with
these
two
tourists
i
had
had
the
intention
of
embracing
the
faith
of
pythagoras
then
i
had
mewed
like
a
cat
with
all
the
strength
of
my
lungs
now
the
male
tourist
vanishes
and
leaves
me
in
charge
of
the
female
tourist
alone
and
at
night
in
a
strange
city
and
now
the
female
tourist
proposes
that
i
take
her
home
with
a
remnant
of
i
groped
for
my
seized
it
screwed
it
firmly
into
my
eye
and
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
girl
as
i
looked
my
eyes
softened
my
monacle
dropped
and
i
forgot
everything
in
the
beauty
and
purity
of
the
face
before
me
my
heart
began
to
beat
against
my
stiff
white
waistcoat
had
i
dared
yes
dared
to
think
of
this
wondrous
little
beauty
as
a
female
tourist
her
pale
sweet
face
turned
towards
the
sea
seemed
to
cast
a
spell
upon
the
night
how
loud
my
heart
was
beating
the
yellow
moon
floated
half
dipping
in
the
sea
flooding
land
and
water
with
enchanted
lights
wind
and
wave
seemed
to
feel
the
spell
of
her
eyes
for
the
breeze
died
away
the
heaving
scheldt
tossed
noiselessly
and
the
dark
dutch
luggers
swung
idly
on
the
tide
with
every
sail
adroop
a
sudden
hush
fell
over
land
and
water
the
voices
on
the
promenade
were
stilled
little
by
little
the
shadowy
throng
the
terrace
the
sea
itself
vanished
and
i
only
saw
her
face
shadowed
against
the
moon
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
drifted
miles
above
the
earth
through
all
space
and
eternity
and
there
was
naught
between
me
and
high
heaven
but
that
white
face
ah
how
i
loved
her
i
knew
it
i
never
doubted
it
could
years
of
passionate
adoration
touch
her
heart
her
little
heart
now
beating
so
calmly
with
no
thought
of
love
to
startle
it
from
its
quiet
and
send
it
fluttering
against
the
gentle
breast
in
her
lap
her
clasped
hands
tightened
her
eyelids
drooped
as
though
some
pleasant
thought
was
passing
i
saw
the
color
dye
her
temples
i
saw
the
blue
eyes
turn
half
frightened
to
my
own
i
saw
and
i
knew
she
had
read
my
thoughts
then
we
both
rose
side
by
side
and
she
was
weeping
softly
yet
for
my
life
i
dared
not
speak
she
turned
away
touching
her
eyes
with
a
bit
of
lace
and
i
sprang
to
her
side
and
offered
her
my
arm
can
not
go
back
alone
i
said
she
did
not
take
my
arm
you
hate
me
miss
wyeth
am
very
tired
she
said
must
go
home
can
not
go
alone
do
not
care
to
accept
your
escort
you
send
me
away
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
can
come
if
you
like
so
i
humbly
attended
her
to
the
hôtel
antoine
xxiv
as
we
reached
the
place
verte
and
turned
into
the
court
of
the
hotel
the
sound
of
the
midnight
bells
swept
over
the
city
and
a
jingled
slowly
by
on
its
last
trip
to
the
railroad
station
we
passed
the
fountain
bubbling
and
splashing
in
the
moonlit
court
and
crossing
the
square
entered
the
southern
wing
of
the
hotel
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
she
leaned
for
an
instant
against
the
banisters
am
afraid
we
have
walked
too
fast
i
said
she
turned
to
me
coldly
conventionalities
must
be
observed
you
were
quite
right
in
escaping
as
soon
as
possible
i
protested
assure
you
she
gave
a
little
movement
of
impatience
she
said
tire
me
conventionalities
tire
me
be
satisfied
nobody
has
seen
you
are
cruel
i
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
think
i
care
for
conventionalities
care
everything
you
care
what
people
think
and
you
try
to
do
what
they
say
is
good
form
you
never
did
such
an
original
thing
in
your
life
as
you
have
just
done
read
my
thoughts
i
exclaimed
bitterly
is
not
fair
or
not
i
know
what
you
consider
me
common
pleased
with
any
sort
of
attention
oh
why
should
i
waste
one
word
one
thought
on
you
wyeth
i
began
but
she
interrupted
me
you
dare
tell
me
what
you
think
of
me
would
you
dare
tell
me
what
you
think
of
my
father
i
was
silent
she
turned
and
mounted
two
steps
of
the
stairway
then
faced
me
again
you
think
it
was
for
my
own
pleasure
that
i
permitted
myself
to
be
left
alone
with
you
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
flattered
by
your
attention
do
you
venture
to
think
i
ever
could
be
how
dared
you
think
what
you
did
think
there
on
the
can
not
help
my
thoughts
i
replied
turned
on
me
like
a
tiger
when
you
awoke
from
your
trance
do
you
really
suppose
that
you
mewed
are
you
not
aware
that
my
father
hypnotized
you
i
did
not
know
it
i
said
the
hot
blood
tingled
in
my
and
i
looked
angrily
at
her
do
you
imagine
that
i
waste
my
time
on
you
she
said
vanity
has
answered
that
question
now
let
your
intelligence
answer
it
i
am
a
pythagorean
i
have
been
chosen
to
bring
in
a
convert
and
you
were
the
convert
selected
for
me
by
the
mahatmas
of
the
consolidated
trust
company
i
have
followed
you
from
new
york
to
antwerp
as
i
was
bidden
but
now
my
courage
fails
and
i
shrink
from
fulfilling
my
mission
knowing
you
to
be
the
type
of
man
you
are
if
i
could
give
it
up
if
i
could
only
go
away
never
never
again
to
see
you
ah
i
fear
they
will
not
permit
it
until
my
mission
is
accomplished
why
was
i
chosen
i
with
a
woman
heart
and
a
pride
i
i
hate
you
love
you
i
said
slowly
she
paled
and
looked
away
me
i
said
her
wide
blue
eyes
turned
back
again
and
i
held
them
with
mine
at
last
she
slowly
drew
a
rose
from
the
bunch
at
her
belt
turned
and
mounted
the
shadowy
staircase
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
saw
her
pause
on
the
landing
above
but
the
moonlight
was
uncertain
after
waiting
for
a
long
time
in
vain
i
moved
away
and
in
going
raised
my
hand
to
my
face
but
i
stopped
short
and
my
heart
stopped
too
for
a
moment
in
my
hand
i
held
a
rose
with
my
brain
in
a
whirl
i
crept
across
the
court
and
mounted
the
stairs
to
my
room
hour
after
hour
i
walked
the
floor
slowly
at
first
then
more
rapidly
but
it
brought
no
calm
to
the
fierce
tumult
of
my
thoughts
and
at
last
i
dropped
into
a
chair
before
the
empty
fireplace
burying
my
head
in
my
hands
uncertain
shocked
and
deadly
weary
i
tried
to
think
i
strove
to
bring
order
out
of
the
chaos
in
my
brain
but
i
only
sat
staring
at
the
rose
slowly
i
began
to
take
a
vague
pleasure
in
its
heavy
perfume
and
once
i
crushed
a
leaf
between
my
palms
and
bending
over
drank
in
the
fragrance
twice
my
lamp
flickered
and
went
out
and
twice
treading
softly
i
crossed
the
room
to
relight
it
twice
i
threw
open
the
door
thinking
that
i
heard
some
sound
without
how
close
the
air
was
how
heavy
and
hot
and
what
was
that
strange
subtle
odor
which
had
insensibly
filled
the
room
it
grew
stronger
and
more
penetrating
and
i
began
to
dislike
it
and
to
escape
it
i
buried
my
nose
in
the
rose
horror
the
odor
came
from
the
rose
and
the
rose
itself
was
no
longer
a
rose
not
even
a
flower
now
it
was
only
a
bunch
of
catnip
and
i
dashed
it
to
the
floor
and
ground
it
under
my
heel
i
cried
in
a
rage
my
anger
grew
cold
and
i
shivered
drawn
perforce
to
the
curtained
window
something
was
there
outside
i
could
not
hear
it
for
it
made
no
sound
but
i
knew
it
was
there
watching
me
what
was
it
the
damp
hair
stirred
on
my
head
i
touched
the
heavy
curtains
whatever
was
outside
them
sprang
up
tore
at
the
window
and
then
rushed
away
feeling
very
shaky
i
crept
to
the
window
opened
it
and
leaned
out
the
night
was
calm
i
heard
the
fountain
splashing
in
the
moonlight
and
the
soughing
through
the
palms
then
i
closed
the
window
and
turned
back
into
the
room
and
as
i
stood
there
a
sudden
breeze
which
could
not
have
come
from
without
blew
sharply
in
my
face
extinguishing
the
candle
and
sending
the
long
curtains
bellying
out
into
the
room
the
lamp
on
the
table
flashed
and
smoked
and
sputtered
the
room
was
littered
with
flying
papers
and
catnip
leaves
then
the
strange
wind
died
away
and
somewhere
in
the
night
a
cat
snarled
i
turned
desperately
to
my
trunk
and
flung
it
open
into
it
i
threw
everything
i
owned
closed
the
lid
locked
it
and
seizing
my
mackintosh
and
ran
down
the
stairs
crossed
the
court
and
entered
the
of
the
hotel
there
i
called
up
the
sleepy
clerk
settled
my
reckoning
and
sent
a
porter
for
a
cab
i
said
time
does
the
next
train
leave
next
train
for
where
the
clerk
locked
the
safe
and
carefully
keeping
the
desk
between
himself
and
me
motioned
the
to
look
at
the
train
brussels
paris
read
the
boy
at
that
moment
the
cab
rattled
up
by
the
curbstone
and
i
sprang
in
while
the
porter
tossed
my
traps
on
top
away
we
bumped
over
the
stony
pavement
past
street
after
street
lighted
dimly
by
tall
and
alley
after
alley
brilliant
with
the
glare
of
villanous
and
then
turning
we
rumbled
past
the
circus
and
the
eldorado
and
at
last
stopped
with
a
jolt
before
the
brussels
station
i
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
i
cried
and
pocketing
the
book
of
coupons
hurried
across
the
platform
to
where
the
brussels
train
lay
a
guard
came
running
up
flung
open
the
door
of
a
carriage
slammed
and
locked
it
after
i
had
jumped
in
and
the
long
train
glided
from
the
arched
station
out
into
the
starlit
morning
i
was
all
alone
in
the
compartment
the
wretched
lamp
in
the
roof
flickered
dimly
scarcely
lighting
the
stuffy
box
i
could
not
see
to
read
my
so
i
wrapped
my
legs
in
the
and
lay
back
staring
out
into
the
misty
morning
trees
walls
flashed
past
and
the
cinders
drove
in
showers
against
the
rattling
windows
i
slept
at
times
fitfully
and
once
springing
up
peered
sharply
at
the
opposite
seat
possessed
with
the
idea
that
somebody
was
there
when
the
train
reached
brussels
i
was
sound
asleep
and
the
guard
awoke
me
with
difficulty
sir
he
asked
i
sighed
and
stepped
out
to
the
platform
rubbing
my
legs
and
shivering
the
other
passengers
were
already
breakfasting
in
the
station
café
and
i
joined
them
and
managed
to
swallow
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
roll
the
morning
broke
gray
and
cloudy
and
i
bundled
myself
into
my
mackintosh
for
a
tramp
along
the
platform
up
and
down
i
stamped
puffing
a
cigar
and
digging
my
hands
deep
in
my
pockets
while
the
other
passengers
huddled
into
the
warmer
compartments
of
the
train
or
stood
watching
the
luggage
being
lifted
into
the
forward
the
wait
was
very
long
the
hands
of
the
great
clock
pointed
to
six
and
still
the
train
lay
motionless
along
the
platform
i
approached
a
guard
and
asked
him
whether
anything
was
wrong
on
the
line
he
replied
had
better
go
to
his
compartment
and
try
to
sleep
for
we
may
be
delayed
until
noon
i
followed
the
guard
advice
and
crawling
into
my
corner
wrapped
myself
in
the
rug
and
lay
back
watching
the
spattering
along
the
at
noon
the
train
had
not
moved
and
i
lunched
in
the
compartment
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
came
hurrying
along
the
platform
crying
montez
messieurs
vous
plaît
and
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
and
whirled
away
through
the
flat
treeless
belgian
plains
at
times
i
dozed
but
the
shaking
of
the
car
always
awoke
me
and
i
would
sit
blinking
out
at
the
endless
stretch
of
plain
until
a
sudden
flurry
of
rain
blotted
the
landscape
from
my
eyes
at
last
a
long
shrill
whistle
from
the
engine
a
jolt
a
series
of
bumps
and
an
apparition
of
red
trousers
and
bayonets
warned
me
that
we
had
arrived
at
the
french
frontier
i
turned
out
with
the
others
and
opened
my
valise
for
inspection
but
the
customs
officials
merely
chalked
it
without
examination
and
i
hurried
back
to
my
compartment
amid
the
shouting
of
guards
and
the
clanging
of
station
bells
again
i
found
that
i
was
alone
in
the
compartment
so
i
smoked
a
cigarette
thanked
heaven
and
fell
into
a
dreamless
sleep
how
long
i
slept
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
awoke
the
train
was
roaring
through
a
tunnel
when
again
it
flashed
out
into
the
open
country
i
peered
through
the
grimy
window
and
saw
that
the
storm
had
ceased
and
stars
were
twinkling
in
the
sky
i
stretched
my
legs
yawned
pushed
my
back
from
my
forehead
and
stumbling
to
my
feet
walked
up
and
down
the
compartment
until
my
cramped
muscles
were
relieved
then
i
sat
down
again
and
lighting
a
cigar
puffed
great
rings
and
clouds
of
fragrant
smoke
across
the
aisle
the
train
was
flying
the
cars
lurched
and
shook
and
the
windows
rattled
accompaniment
to
the
creaking
panels
the
smoke
from
my
cigar
dimmed
the
lamp
in
the
ceiling
and
hid
the
opposite
seat
from
view
how
it
curled
and
writhed
in
the
corners
now
eddying
upward
now
floating
across
the
aisle
like
a
veil
i
lounged
back
in
my
cushioned
seat
watching
it
with
interest
what
queer
shapes
it
took
how
thick
it
was
becoming
how
strangely
luminous
now
it
had
filled
the
whole
compartment
puff
after
puff
crowding
upward
waving
wavering
clouding
the
windows
and
blotting
the
lamp
from
sight
it
was
most
interesting
i
had
never
before
smoked
such
a
cigar
what
an
extraordinary
brand
i
examined
the
end
flicking
the
ashes
away
the
cigar
was
out
fumbling
for
a
match
to
relight
it
my
eyes
fell
on
the
drifting
which
swayed
across
the
corner
opposite
it
seemed
almost
tangible
how
like
a
real
curtain
it
hung
gray
impenetrable
a
man
might
hide
behind
it
then
an
idea
came
into
my
head
and
it
persisted
until
my
uneasiness
amounted
to
a
vague
terror
i
tried
to
fight
it
off
i
strove
to
resist
but
the
conviction
slowly
settled
upon
me
that
something
was
behind
that
something
which
had
entered
the
compartment
while
i
slept
ca
be
i
muttered
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
misty
drapery
train
has
not
stopped
the
car
creaked
and
trembled
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
swept
my
arm
through
the
veil
of
smoke
then
my
hair
rose
on
my
head
for
my
hand
touched
another
hand
and
my
eyes
had
met
two
other
eyes
i
heard
a
voice
in
the
gloom
low
and
sweet
calling
me
by
name
i
saw
the
eyes
again
tender
and
blue
soft
fingers
touched
my
own
you
afraid
she
said
my
heart
began
to
beat
again
and
my
face
warmed
with
returning
blood
is
only
i
she
said
gently
i
seemed
to
hear
my
own
voice
speaking
as
if
at
a
great
distance
here
alone
cruel
of
you
she
faltered
am
not
alone
at
the
same
instant
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
professor
calmly
seated
by
the
farther
window
his
hands
were
thrust
into
the
folds
of
a
corded
and
tasselled
from
beneath
which
peeped
two
enormous
feet
encased
in
carpet
slippers
upon
his
head
towered
a
yellow
he
did
not
pay
the
slightest
attention
to
either
me
or
his
daughter
and
except
for
the
lighted
cigar
which
he
kept
shifting
between
his
lips
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
wax
dummy
then
i
began
to
speak
feebly
hesitating
like
a
child
did
you
come
into
this
compartment
you
you
do
not
possess
wings
i
suppose
you
could
not
have
been
here
all
the
time
will
you
explain
explain
to
me
see
i
ask
you
very
humbly
for
i
do
not
understand
this
is
the
nineteenth
century
and
these
things
do
fit
in
i
wearing
a
dunlap
hat
i
got
a
copy
of
the
new
york
in
my
bag
president
roosevelt
is
alive
and
everything
is
so
very
unromantic
in
the
world
is
this
real
magic
perhaps
i
filled
with
hallucinations
perhaps
i
asleep
and
dreaming
perhaps
you
are
not
really
here
nor
i
nor
anybody
nor
anything
the
train
plunged
into
a
tunnel
and
when
again
it
dashed
out
from
the
other
end
the
cold
wind
blew
furiously
in
my
face
from
the
farther
window
it
was
wide
open
the
professor
was
gone
has
changed
to
another
compartment
she
said
quietly
think
perhaps
you
were
beginning
to
bore
him
her
eyes
met
mine
and
she
smiled
you
very
much
bewildered
i
looked
at
her
in
silence
she
sat
very
quietly
her
hands
clasped
above
her
knee
her
curly
hair
glittering
to
her
girdle
a
long
robe
almost
silvery
in
the
twilight
clung
to
her
young
figure
her
bare
feet
were
thrust
deep
into
a
pair
of
shimmering
eastern
slippers
you
fled
she
sighed
was
asleep
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
i
barely
had
a
moment
to
go
to
bombay
to
find
papa
and
return
in
time
to
join
you
this
is
an
costume
still
i
was
silent
you
shocked
she
asked
simply
i
replied
in
a
dull
voice
past
that
are
very
rude
she
said
with
the
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
do
not
mean
to
be
i
only
wish
to
go
away
away
somewhere
and
find
out
what
my
name
is
name
is
harold
kensett
you
sure
i
asked
eagerly
what
troubles
you
everything
plain
to
you
are
you
a
sort
of
prophet
and
medium
is
nothing
hidden
from
you
i
asked
she
faltered
my
head
ached
and
i
clasped
it
in
my
hand
a
sudden
change
came
over
her
am
human
believe
me
she
said
with
piteous
eagerness
i
do
not
seem
strange
to
those
who
understand
you
wonder
because
you
left
me
at
midnight
in
antwerp
and
you
wake
to
find
me
here
if
because
i
find
myself
reincarnated
endowed
with
senses
and
capabilities
which
few
at
present
possess
if
i
am
so
made
why
should
it
seem
strange
it
is
all
so
natural
to
me
if
i
appear
to
you
i
cried
you
vanish
she
murmured
it
seem
to
you
unmaidenly
heaven
i
groaned
she
cried
with
tears
in
her
voice
please
do
help
me
to
bear
it
if
you
only
knew
how
awful
it
is
to
be
different
from
other
girls
how
mortifying
it
is
to
me
to
be
able
to
vanish
oh
how
i
hate
and
detest
it
all
cry
i
said
looking
at
her
pityingly
dear
me
she
sobbed
shudder
at
the
sight
of
me
because
i
can
vanish
do
i
cried
you
do
you
abhor
me
you
shrink
away
oh
why
did
i
ever
see
you
why
did
you
ever
come
into
my
life
what
have
i
done
in
ages
past
that
now
reborn
i
suffer
cruelly
cruelly
do
you
mean
i
whispered
my
voice
trembled
with
happiness
nothing
but
you
think
me
a
fabled
monster
my
sweet
wilhelmina
i
said
do
think
you
a
fabled
monster
i
love
you
see
see
i
am
at
your
feet
listen
to
me
my
darling
she
turned
her
blue
eyes
to
mine
i
saw
tears
sparkling
on
the
curved
lashes
i
love
you
i
said
again
slowly
she
raised
her
hands
to
my
head
and
held
it
a
moment
looking
at
me
strangely
then
her
face
grew
nearer
to
my
own
her
glittering
hair
fell
over
my
shoulders
her
lips
rested
on
mine
in
that
long
sweet
kiss
the
beating
of
her
heart
answered
mine
and
i
learned
a
thousand
truths
wonderful
mysterious
splendid
but
when
our
lips
fell
apart
the
memory
of
what
i
learned
departed
also
was
so
very
simple
and
beautiful
she
sighed
i
i
never
saw
it
but
the
mahatmas
knew
ah
they
knew
that
my
mission
could
only
be
accomplished
through
love
it
is
i
whispered
you
shall
teach
me
me
your
husband
and
you
will
not
be
impatient
you
will
try
to
believe
will
believe
what
you
tell
me
my
sweetheart
about
cats
before
i
could
reply
the
farther
window
opened
and
a
yellow
followed
by
the
professor
entered
from
somewhere
without
wilhelmina
sank
back
on
her
sofa
but
the
professor
needed
not
to
be
told
and
we
both
knew
he
was
already
busily
reading
our
thoughts
for
a
moment
there
was
dead
silence
long
enough
for
the
professor
to
grasp
the
full
significance
of
what
had
passed
then
he
uttered
a
single
exclamation
after
a
while
however
he
looked
at
me
for
the
first
time
that
evening
saying
you
kensett
i
sure
tied
several
knots
in
the
cord
of
his
lighted
a
cigar
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
either
of
us
some
moments
later
he
opened
the
window
again
and
disappeared
i
looked
across
the
aisle
at
wilhelmina
may
come
over
beside
me
she
said
shyly
xxv
it
was
nearly
ten
and
our
train
was
rapidly
approaching
paris
we
passed
village
after
village
wrapped
in
mist
station
after
station
hung
with
twinkling
red
and
blue
and
yellow
lanterns
then
sped
on
again
with
the
echo
of
the
ringing
in
our
ears
when
at
length
the
train
slowed
up
and
stopped
i
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
a
long
wet
platform
shining
under
the
electric
lights
a
guard
came
running
by
throwing
open
the
doors
of
each
compartment
and
crying
next
tickets
if
you
please
i
handed
him
my
book
of
coupons
from
which
he
tore
several
and
handed
it
back
then
he
lifted
his
lantern
and
peered
into
the
compartment
saying
monsieur
alone
i
turned
to
wilhelmina
wants
your
ticket
give
it
to
me
that
demanded
the
guard
i
looked
anxiously
at
wilhelmina
your
father
has
the
tickets
i
began
but
was
interrupted
by
the
guard
who
snapped
will
give
himself
the
trouble
to
remember
that
i
do
not
understand
english
quiet
i
said
sharply
in
french
am
not
speaking
to
you
the
guard
stared
stupidly
at
me
then
at
my
luggage
and
finally
entering
the
car
knelt
down
and
peered
under
the
seats
presently
he
got
up
very
red
in
the
face
and
went
out
slamming
the
door
he
had
not
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
wilhelmina
but
i
distinctly
heard
him
say
englishmen
and
idiots
talk
to
themselves
i
faltered
you
mean
to
say
that
that
guard
could
not
see
you
she
began
to
look
so
serious
again
that
i
merely
added
mind
i
do
care
whether
you
are
invisible
or
not
dearest
am
not
invisible
to
you
she
said
should
you
care
a
great
noise
of
bells
and
whistles
drowned
our
voices
and
amid
the
whirring
of
the
hissing
of
steam
and
the
cries
of
all
out
our
train
glided
into
the
station
it
was
the
professor
who
opened
the
door
of
our
carriage
there
he
stood
calmly
adjusting
his
yellow
and
drawing
his
closer
with
the
corded
tassels
have
you
been
i
asked
the
engine
the
engine
i
suppose
you
mean
i
said
i
do
i
mean
the
engine
on
the
pilot
it
was
very
refreshing
where
are
we
going
now
you
know
paris
asked
wilhelmina
turning
to
me
i
think
your
father
had
better
take
you
to
the
hôtel
normandie
on
the
rue
de
you
must
stay
there
too
course
if
you
wish
she
laughed
nervously
you
see
that
my
father
and
i
could
not
take
rooms
now
you
must
engage
three
rooms
for
yourself
i
asked
stupidly
dear
why
because
we
are
invisible
i
tried
to
repress
a
shudder
the
professor
gave
wilhelmina
his
arm
and
as
i
studied
his
ensemble
i
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
invisible
at
the
gate
of
the
station
i
hailed
a
cab
and
we
rattled
away
through
the
stony
streets
brilliant
with
and
in
a
few
moments
rolled
smoothly
across
the
avenue
de
turned
into
the
rue
de
and
stopped
a
bright
little
page
all
over
buttons
came
out
took
my
luggage
and
preceded
us
into
the
hallway
i
with
wilhelmina
on
my
arm
and
the
professor
shuffling
along
beside
me
walked
over
to
the
desk
said
the
clerk
have
a
very
desirable
room
on
the
second
fronting
the
rue
honoré
we
that
is
i
want
three
rooms
three
separate
rooms
i
said
the
clerk
scratched
his
chin
is
expecting
friends
yes
whispered
wilhelmina
with
a
suspicion
of
laughter
in
her
voice
i
repeated
feebly
of
course
said
the
clerk
looking
at
me
narrowly
lady
of
course
that
to
you
i
said
sharply
do
you
mean
by
speaking
to
us
mean
to
me
i
said
badly
rattled
me
the
rooms
and
let
me
get
to
bed
will
you
will
remember
said
the
clerk
coldly
this
is
an
old
and
respectable
hotel
know
it
i
said
smothering
my
rage
the
clerk
eyed
me
suspiciously
he
called
with
irritating
deliberation
this
gentleman
to
apartment
ten
many
rooms
are
there
i
demanded
and
a
parlor
will
take
it
i
said
with
composure
probation
muttered
the
clerk
insolently
swallowing
the
insult
i
followed
the
up
the
stairs
keeping
between
him
and
wilhelmina
for
i
dreaded
to
see
him
walk
through
her
as
if
she
were
thin
air
a
trim
maid
rose
to
meet
us
and
conducted
us
through
a
hallway
into
a
large
apartment
she
threw
open
all
the
and
said
monsieur
have
the
goodness
to
choose
will
you
take
i
began
turning
to
wilhelmina
monsieur
cried
the
startled
maid
that
completely
upset
me
i
muttered
slipping
some
silver
into
her
hand
for
the
love
of
heaven
run
away
when
she
had
vanished
with
a
doubtful
monsieur
i
handed
the
professor
the
keys
and
asked
him
to
settle
the
thing
with
wilhelmina
wilhelmina
took
the
corner
room
the
professor
rambled
into
the
next
one
and
i
said
and
crept
wearily
into
my
own
chamber
i
sat
down
and
tried
to
think
a
great
feeling
of
fatigue
weighted
my
spirits
can
think
better
with
my
clothes
off
i
said
and
slipped
the
coat
from
my
shoulders
how
tired
i
was
can
think
better
in
bed
i
muttered
flinging
my
cravat
on
the
dresser
and
tossing
my
after
it
i
was
certainly
very
tired
i
yawned
grasping
the
pillow
and
drawing
it
under
my
head
i
can
think
a
bit
but
before
my
head
fell
on
the
pillow
sleep
closed
my
eyes
i
began
to
dream
at
once
it
seemed
as
though
my
eyes
were
wide
open
and
the
professor
was
standing
beside
my
bed
man
he
said
won
my
daughter
and
you
must
pay
the
piper
piper
i
said
pied
piper
of
hamelin
i
do
think
replied
the
professor
vulgarly
and
before
i
could
realize
what
he
was
doing
he
had
drawn
a
reed
pipe
from
his
and
was
playing
a
strangely
annoying
air
then
an
awful
thing
occurred
cats
began
to
troop
into
the
room
cats
by
the
hundred
toms
and
tabbies
gray
yellow
maltese
persian
manx
all
purring
and
all
marching
round
and
round
rubbing
against
the
furniture
the
professor
and
even
against
me
i
struggled
with
the
nightmare
them
away
i
tried
to
gasp
he
said
is
an
old
friend
i
saw
the
white
tabby
cat
of
the
hôtel
antoine
old
friend
he
repeated
and
played
a
dismal
melody
on
his
reed
i
saw
wilhelmina
enter
the
room
lift
the
white
tabby
in
her
arms
and
bring
her
to
my
side
hands
with
him
she
commanded
to
my
horror
the
tabby
deliberately
extended
a
paw
and
tapped
me
on
the
knuckles
i
cried
in
agony
is
a
horrible
dream
why
oh
why
ca
i
wake
she
said
dropping
the
cat
is
partly
a
dream
but
some
of
it
is
real
remember
what
i
say
my
darling
you
are
to
go
morning
and
meet
the
train
from
antwerp
at
the
gare
du
nord
papa
and
i
are
coming
to
paris
on
that
train
do
you
know
that
we
are
not
really
here
now

silly
boy
then
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
i
saw
her
glide
from
the
room
followed
by
the
professor
playing
a
gay
to
which
the
cats
danced
two
and
two
sir
said
each
cat
as
it
passed
my
bed
and
i
dreamed
no
more
when
i
awoke
the
room
the
bed
had
vanished
i
was
in
the
street
walking
rapidly
the
sun
shone
down
on
the
broad
white
pavements
of
paris
and
the
streams
of
busy
life
flowed
past
me
on
either
side
how
swiftly
i
was
walking
where
the
devil
was
i
going
surely
i
had
business
somewhere
that
needed
immediate
attention
i
tried
to
remember
when
i
had
awakened
but
i
could
not
i
wondered
where
i
had
dressed
myself
i
had
apparently
taken
great
pains
with
my
toilet
for
i
was
immaculate
monocle
and
all
even
down
to
a
rose
nestling
in
my
i
knew
paris
and
recognized
the
streets
through
which
i
was
hurrying
where
could
i
be
going
what
was
my
hurry
i
glanced
at
my
watch
and
found
i
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
then
as
the
bells
of
the
city
rang
out
i
hastened
into
the
railroad
station
on
the
rue
lafayette
and
walked
out
to
the
platform
and
as
i
looked
down
the
glittering
track
around
the
distant
curve
shot
a
locomotive
followed
by
a
long
line
of
cars
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
while
the
sounded
and
the
began
ringing
all
along
the
track
express
cried
the
de
gare
and
as
the
train
slipped
along
the
tiled
platform
i
sprang
upon
the
steps
of
a
carriage
and
threw
open
the
door
do
you
do
mr
kensett
said
wilhelmina
wyeth
springing
lightly
to
the
platform
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
come
to
the
train
at
the
same
moment
a
bald
gentleman
emerged
from
the
depths
of
the
same
compartment
carrying
a
large
covered
basket
are
you
kensett
he
said
to
see
you
again
rather
warm
in
that
compartment
no
i
will
not
trust
this
basket
to
an
expressman
give
wilhelmina
your
arm
and
i
follow
we
go
to
the
normandie
i
believe
all
the
morning
i
had
wilhelmina
to
myself
and
at
dinner
i
sat
beside
her
with
the
professor
opposite
the
latter
was
cheerful
enough
but
he
nearly
ruined
my
appetite
for
he
smelled
strongly
of
catnip
after
dinner
he
became
restless
and
fidgeted
about
in
his
chair
until
coffee
was
brought
and
we
went
up
to
the
parlor
of
our
apartment
here
his
restlessness
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
i
ventured
to
ask
him
if
he
was
in
good
health
that
basket
the
covered
basket
which
i
have
in
the
next
room
he
said
the
trouble
with
the
basket
i
asked
basket
all
right
but
the
contents
worry
me
i
inquire
what
the
contents
are
i
ventured
the
professor
rose
he
said
may
inquire
of
my
daughter
he
left
the
room
but
reappeared
shortly
carrying
a
saucer
of
milk
i
watched
him
enter
the
next
room
which
was
mine
on
earth
is
he
taking
that
into
my
room
for
i
asked
wilhelmina
do
keep
cats
you
will
she
said
never
will
if
i
ask
you
to
but
you
wo
ask
me
i
do
detest
cats
must
not
ca
help
it
will
when
i
ask
it
have
i
not
given
myself
to
you
will
you
not
make
a
little
sacrifice
for
me
do
understand
you
refuse
my
first
request
i
said
miserably
will
keep
dozens
of
cats
do
not
ask
that
i
only
wish
you
to
keep
one
that
what
your
father
had
in
that
basket
i
asked
suspiciously
the
basket
came
from
antwerp
the
white
antwerp
cat
i
cried
you
ask
me
to
keep
that
cat
oh
wilhelmina
she
said
have
a
long
story
to
tell
you
come
nearer
close
to
me
you
say
you
love
me
i
bent
and
kissed
her
i
shall
put
you
to
the
proof
she
murmured
me
that
cat
is
the
same
cat
that
ran
out
of
the
apartment
in
the
waldorf
when
your
ceased
to
exist
in
human
shape
my
father
and
myself
having
received
word
from
the
mahatmas
of
the
trust
company
sheltered
and
cherished
the
cat
we
were
ordered
by
the
mahatmas
to
convert
you
the
task
was
appalling
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
refusing
a
command
and
we
laid
our
plans
that
man
with
a
white
spot
in
his
hair
was
my
father
your
father
is
bald
wore
a
wig
then
the
white
spot
came
from
dropping
chemicals
on
the
wig
while
experimenting
with
a
substance
which
you
could
not
comprehend
then
that
clew
was
useless
but
who
could
have
taken
the
crimson
diamond
and
who
was
the
man
with
the
white
spot
on
his
head
who
tried
to
sell
the
stone
in
paris
was
my
father
he
st
took
the
crimson
diamond
i
cried
aghast
and
no
that
was
only
a
paste
stone
that
he
had
in
paris
it
was
to
draw
you
over
here
he
had
the
real
crimson
diamond
also
father
he
has
it
in
the
next
room
now
can
you
not
see
how
it
disappeared
harold
why
the
cat
swallowed
it
you
mean
to
say
that
the
white
tabby
swallowed
the
crimson
diamond
mistake
she
tried
to
get
it
out
of
the
velvet
bag
and
as
the
bag
was
also
full
of
catnip
she
could
not
resist
a
mouthful
and
unfortunately
just
then
you
broke
in
the
door
and
so
startled
the
cat
that
she
swallowed
the
crimson
diamond
there
was
a
painful
pause
at
last
i
said
as
you
are
able
to
vanish
i
suppose
you
also
are
able
to
converse
with
cats
am
she
replied
trying
to
keep
back
the
tears
of
mortification
that
cat
told
you
this
did
my
crimson
diamond
is
inside
that
cat
is
said
i
firmly
am
going
to
chloroform
the
cat
she
cried
in
terror
cat
is
your
i
do
know
to
this
day
how
i
stood
the
shock
of
that
announcement
or
how
i
managed
to
listen
while
wilhelmina
tried
to
explain
the
transmigration
theory
but
it
was
all
chinese
to
me
i
only
knew
that
i
was
a
blood
relation
of
a
cat
and
the
thought
nearly
drove
me
mad
my
darling
try
to
love
her
whispered
wilhelmina
must
be
very
precious
to
you
with
my
diamond
inside
her
i
replied
faintly
must
not
neglect
her
said
wilhelmina
no
i
always
have
my
eye
on
her
i
mean
i
will
surround
her
with
luxury
er
milk
and
bones
and
catnip
and
books
er
does
she
read
the
books
that
human
beings
read
now
go
and
speak
to
your
aunt
harold
how
the
deuce
for
my
sake
try
to
be
cordial
she
rose
and
led
me
unresistingly
to
the
door
of
my
room
heavens
i
groaned
is
awful
my
darling
she
whispered
brave
for
love
of
me
i
drew
her
to
me
and
kissed
her
beads
of
cold
perspiration
started
in
the
roots
of
my
hair
but
i
clenched
my
teeth
and
entered
the
room
alone
the
room
was
dark
and
i
stood
silent
not
knowing
where
to
turn
fearful
lest
i
step
on
my
aunt
then
through
the
dreary
silence
i
called
a
faint
noise
broke
upon
my
ear
and
my
heart
grew
sick
but
i
strode
into
the
darkness
calling
hoarsely
tabby
it
is
your
nephew
again
the
faint
sound
something
was
stirring
there
among
the
shadows
a
shape
moving
softly
along
the
wall
a
shade
which
glided
by
me
paused
wavered
and
darted
under
the
bed
then
i
threw
myself
on
the
floor
profoundly
moved
begging
imploring
my
aunt
to
come
to
me
aunty
i
murmured
nephew
is
waiting
to
take
you
to
his
heart
at
last
i
saw
my
eyes
shining
in
the
dark
the
young
man
voice
grew
hushed
and
solemn
and
he
lifted
his
hand
in
silence
close
the
door
that
meeting
is
not
for
the
eyes
of
the
world
close
the
door
upon
that
sacred
scene
where
and
nephew
are
united
at
last
a
long
pause
followed
deep
emotion
was
visible
in
miss
sensitive
face
she
said
then
you
are
married
no
replied
kensett
in
a
mortified
voice
why
not
i
asked
amazed
because
he
said
although
my
fiancée
was
prepared
to
accept
a
cat
as
her
she
could
not
endure
the
complications
that
followed
what
complications
inquired
miss
barrison
the
young
man
sighed
profoundly
shaking
his
head
my
had
kittens
he
said
softly
the
tremendous
scientific
importance
of
these
experiences
excited
me
beyond
measure
the
simplicity
of
the
narrative
the
elaborate
attention
to
corroborative
detail
all
bore
irresistible
testimony
to
the
truth
of
these
accounts
of
phenomena
vitally
important
to
the
entire
world
of
science
we
all
dined
together
that
night
a
little
earnest
company
of
in
the
vast
wilderness
of
the
unexplored
and
we
lingered
long
in
the
propounding
questions
advancing
theories
speculating
upon
possibilities
of
most
intense
interest
never
before
had
i
known
a
man
whose
relatives
were
cats
and
kittens
but
he
did
not
appear
to
share
my
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
you
see
he
said
looking
at
miss
barrison
it
may
be
interesting
from
a
purely
scientific
point
of
view
but
it
has
already
proved
a
bar
to
my
marrying
were
the
kittens
black
i
inquired
no
he
said
my
aunt
drew
the
i
am
proud
to
say
i
do
see
said
miss
barrison
why
the
fact
that
your
is
a
cat
should
prevent
you
from
marrying
it
would
prevent
said
the
young
man
quickly
nor
me
mused
miss
barrison
if
i
were
really
in
love
meanwhile
i
had
been
very
busy
thinking
about
professor
farrago
and
coming
to
an
interesting
theory
advanced
it
if
i
began
he
marries
one
of
those
transparent
ladies
what
about
the
children
some
would
be
no
doubt
transparent
said
kensett
they
might
be
only
translucent
suggested
miss
barrison
or
partially
opaque
i
ventured
but
it
a
risky
marriage
not
to
be
able
to
see
what
one
wife
is
about
that
is
a
silly
reflection
on
women
said
miss
barrison
quietly
besides
a
girl
need
not
be
transparent
to
conceal
what
doing
this
observation
seemed
to
end
our
postprandial
and
tripartite
conference
miss
barrison
retired
to
her
stateroom
presently
after
a
last
cigar
smoked
almost
in
silence
the
young
man
and
i
bade
each
other
a
civil
and
retired
to
our
respective
berths
i
think
it
was
at
richmond
virginia
that
i
was
awakened
by
the
negro
porter
shaking
me
very
gently
and
repeating
in
a
pleasant
monotonous
voice
foh
you
suh

gilland
suh

you

i
muttered
sitting
up
in
my
bunk
is
it
as
late
as
that
where
are
we
i
slid
up
the
and
sat
blinking
at
a
flood
of
sunshine
telegram
i
said
yawning
and
rubbing
my
eyes
let
me
have
it
all
right
i
be
out
presently
shut
that
curtain
i
do
want
the
entire
car
to

pink
pajamas

grinned
the
porter
retiring
i
heard
him
but
did
not
comprehend
sitting
there
sleepily
unfolding
the
scrawled
telegram
suddenly
my
eyes
flew
wide
open
i
scanned
the
despatch
with
stunned
incredulity

shouted

help
there
was
no
response
oh
lord
i
groaned
and
rolled
over
burying
my
head
in
the
blankets
for
i
understood
at
last
that
science
the
most
jealous
most
exacting
of
mistresses
could
never
brook
