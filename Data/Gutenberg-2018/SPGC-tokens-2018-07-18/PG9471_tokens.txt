introductory
i
think
that
is
the
way
my
father
would
begin
my
name
is
ethelwyn
percivale
and
used
to
be
ethelwyn
walton
i
always
put
the
walton
in
between
when
i
write
to
my
father
for
i
think
it
is
quite
enough
to
have
to
leave
father
and
mother
behind
for
a
husband
without
leaving
their
name
behind
you
also
i
am
fond
of
and
in
some
houses
consider
them
far
the
most
interesting
spots
but
i
do
choose
that
my
old
name
should
lie
about
in
the
one
at
home
i
am
much
afraid
of
writing
nonsense
but
my
father
tells
me
that
to
see
things
in
print
is
a
great
help
to
recognizing
whether
they
are
nonsense
or
not
and
he
tells
me
too
that
his
friend
the
publisher
who
but
i
will
speak
of
him
presently
his
friend
the
publisher
is
not
like
any
other
publisher
he
ever
met
with
before
for
he
never
grumbles
at
any
alterations
writers
choose
to
make
at
least
he
never
says
any
thing
although
it
costs
a
great
deal
to
shift
the
types
again
after
they
are
once
set
up
the
other
part
of
my
excuse
for
attempting
to
write
lies
simply
in
telling
how
it
came
about
ten
days
ago
my
father
came
up
from
marshmallows
to
pay
us
a
visit
he
is
with
us
now
but
we
do
see
much
of
him
all
day
for
he
is
generally
out
with
a
friend
of
his
in
the
east
end
the
parson
of
one
of
the
poorest
parishes
in
london
who
thanks
god
that
he
was
the
nephew
of
any
bishop
to
be
put
into
a
good
living
for
he
learns
more
about
the
ways
of
god
from
having
to
do
with
plain
yes
vulgar
human
nature
than
the
thickness
of
the
varnish
would
ever
have
permitted
him
to
discover
in
what
are
called
the
higher
orders
of
society
yet
i
must
say
that
amongst
those
i
have
recognized
as
nearest
the
sacred
communism
of
the
early
church
a
phrase
of
my
father
are
two
or
three
people
of
rank
and
wealth
whose
names
are
written
in
heaven
and
need
not
be
set
down
in
my
poor
story
a
few
days
ago
then
my
father
coming
home
to
dinner
brought
with
him
the
publisher
of
the
two
books
called
the
annals
of
a
quiet
neighborhood
and
the
seaboard
parish
the
first
of
these
had
lain
by
him
for
some
years
before
my
father
could
publish
it
and
then
he
remodelled
it
a
little
for
the
magazine
in
which
it
came
out
a
portion
at
a
time
the
second
was
written
at
the
request
of
who
wanted
something
more
of
the
same
sort
and
now
after
some
years
he
had
begun
again
to
represent
to
my
father
at
intervals
the
necessity
for
another
story
to
complete
the
as
he
called
it
insisting
when
my
father
objected
the
difficulties
of
growing
years
and
failing
judgment
that
indeed
he
owed
it
to
him
for
he
had
left
him
in
the
lurch
as
it
were
with
an
incomplete
story
not
to
say
an
uncompleted
series
my
father
still
objected
and
still
urged
until
at
length
my
father
said
this
i
learned
afterwards
of
course
what
would
you
say
if
i
found
you
a
substitute
that
depends
on
who
the
substitute
might
be
walton
said
the
result
of
their
talk
was
that
my
father
brought
him
home
to
dinner
that
day
and
hence
it
comes
that
with
some
real
fear
and
much
metaphorical
trembling
i
am
now
writing
this
i
wonder
if
anybody
will
ever
read
it
this
my
first
chapter
shall
be
composed
of
a
little
of
the
talk
that
passed
at
our
that
day
blackstone
was
the
only
other
stranger
present
and
he
certainly
was
not
much
of
a
stranger
do
you
keep
a
diary
mrs
percivale
asked
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
if
he
expected
an
indignant
repudiation
i
would
rather
keep
a
rag
and
bottle
shop
i
answered
at
which
blackstone
burst
into
one
of
his
splendid
roars
of
laughter
for
if
ever
a
man
could
laugh
like
a
christian
who
believed
the
world
was
in
a
fair
way
after
all
that
man
was
blackstone
and
even
my
husband
who
seldom
laughs
at
any
thing
i
say
with
more
than
his
eyes
was
infected
by
it
and
laughed
heartily
that
rather
a
strong
assertion
my
love
said
my
father
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
it
i
mean
papa
i
answered
that
it
would
be
a
more
profitable
employment
to
keep
the
one
than
the
other
i
suppose
you
think
said
blackstone
that
the
lady
who
keeps
a
diary
is
in
the
same
danger
as
the
old
woman
who
prided
herself
in
keeping
a
strict
account
of
her
personal
expenses
and
it
always
was
correct
for
when
she
could
not
get
it
to
balance
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
brought
it
right
by
putting
down
the
deficit
as
that
just
what
i
mean
i
said
but
resumed
i
did
not
mean
a
diary
of
your
feelings
but
of
the
events
of
the
day
and
hour
which
are
never
in
themselves
worth
putting
down
i
said
all
that
is
worth
remembering
will
find
for
itself
some
convenient
cranny
to
go
to
sleep
in
till
it
is
wanted
without
being
made
a
poor
mummy
of
in
a
diary
if
you
have
such
a
memory
i
grant
that
is
better
even
for
my
purpose
much
better
said
for
your
purpose
i
repeated
in
surprise
i
beg
your
pardon
but
what
designs
can
you
have
upon
my
memory
well
i
suppose
i
had
better
be
as
straightforward
as
i
know
you
would
like
me
to
be
percivale
i
want
you
to
make
up
the
sum
your
father
owes
me
he
owed
me
three
books
he
has
paid
me
two
i
want
the
third
from
you
i
laughed
for
the
very
notion
of
writing
a
book
seemed
preposterous
i
want
you
under
feigned
names
of
course
he
went
on
as
are
all
the
names
in
your
father
two
books
to
give
me
the
further
history
of
the
family
and
in
particular
your
own
experiences
in
london
i
am
confident
the
history
of
your
married
life
must
contain
a
number
of
incidents
which
without
the
least
danger
of
indiscretion
might
be
communicated
to
the
public
to
the
great
advantage
of
all
who
read
them
you
forget
i
said
hardly
believing
him
to
be
in
earnest
that
i
should
be
exposing
my
story
to
you
and
blackstone
at
least
if
i
were
to
make
the
absurd
attempt
i
mean
absurd
as
regards
my
ability
i
should
be
always
thinking
of
you
two
as
my
public
and
whether
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
say
this
and
say
that
which
you
may
see
at
once
would
render
it
impossible
for
me
to
write
at
all
i
think
i
can
suggest
a
way
out
of
that
difficulty
wynnie
said
my
father
you
must
write
freely
all
you
feel
inclined
to
write
and
then
let
your
husband
see
it
you
may
be
content
to
let
all
pass
that
he
passes
you
do
say
you
really
mean
it
papa
the
thing
is
perfectly
impossible
i
never
wrote
a
book
in
my
life
and
no
more
did
i
my
dear
before
i
began
my
first
but
you
grew
up
to
it
by
degrees
papa
i
have
no
doubt
that
will
make
it
the
easier
for
you
when
you
try
i
am
so
far
at
least
a
darwinian
as
to
believe
that
but
really
ought
to
have
more
sense
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
is
perfectly
absurd
to
suppose
me
capable
of
finishing
any
thing
my
father
has
begun
i
assure
you
i
do
feel
flattered
by
your
proposal
i
have
got
a
man
of
more
consequence
for
a
father
than
that
would
imply
all
this
time
my
tall
husband
sat
silent
at
the
foot
of
the
table
as
if
he
had
nothing
on
earth
to
do
with
the
affair
instead
of
coming
to
my
assistance
when
as
i
thought
i
really
needed
it
especially
seeing
my
own
father
was
of
the
combination
against
me
for
what
can
be
more
miserable
than
to
be
taken
for
wiser
or
better
or
cleverer
than
you
know
perfectly
well
you
are
i
looked
down
the
table
straight
and
sharp
at
him
thinking
to
rouse
him
by
the
most
powerful
of
silent
appeals
and
when
he
opened
his
mouth
very
solemnly
staring
at
me
in
return
down
all
the
length
of
the
table
i
thought
i
had
succeeded
but
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
i
heard
him
say
i
think
wynnie
as
your
father
and
appear
to
wish
it
you
might
at
least
try
this
almost
overcame
me
and
i
was
very
near
never
mind
what
i
bit
my
lips
and
tried
to
smile
but
felt
as
if
all
my
friends
had
forsaken
me
and
were
about
to
turn
me
out
to
beg
my
bread
how
on
earth
could
i
write
a
book
without
making
a
fool
of
myself
you
know
percivale
said
you
need
be
afraid
about
the
composition
and
the
spelling
and
all
that
we
can
easily
set
those
to
rights
at
the
office
he
could
have
done
any
thing
better
to
send
the
lump
out
of
my
throat
for
this
made
me
angry
i
am
not
in
the
least
anxious
about
the
spelling
i
answered
and
for
the
rest
pray
what
is
to
become
of
me
if
what
you
print
should
happen
to
be
praised
by
somebody
who
likes
my
husband
or
my
father
and
therefore
wants
to
say
a
good
word
for
me
that
what
a
good
deal
of
reviewing
comes
to
i
understand
am
i
to
receive
in
silence
what
does
belong
to
me
or
am
i
to
send
a
letter
to
the
papers
to
say
that
the
whole
thing
was
patched
and
polished
at
the
and
that
i
have
no
right
to
more
than
perhaps
a
fourth
part
of
the
commendation
how
would
that
do
but
you
forget
it
is
not
to
have
your
name
to
it
he
said
and
so
it
wo
matter
a
bit
there
will
be
nothing
dishonest
about
it
you
forget
that
although
nobody
knows
my
real
name
everybody
will
know
that
i
am
the
daughter
of
that
walton
who
would
have
thrown
his
pen
in
the
fire
if
you
had
meddled
with
any
thing
he
wrote
they
would
be
praising
if
they
praised
at
all
the
name
is
nothing
of
all
things
to
have
praise
you
do
deserve
and
not
to
be
able
to
reject
it
is
the
most
miserable
it
is
as
bad
as
painting
one
face
hardly
a
case
in
point
said
blackstone
for
the
artificial
complexion
would
be
your
own
work
and
the
other
would
not
if
you
come
to
discuss
that
question
said
my
father
we
must
all
confess
we
have
had
in
our
day
to
pocket
a
good
many
more
praises
than
we
had
a
right
to
i
agree
with
you
however
my
child
that
we
must
not
connive
at
any
thing
of
the
sort
so
i
will
propose
this
clause
in
the
bargain
between
you
and
namely
that
if
he
finds
any
fault
with
your
work
he
shall
send
it
back
to
yourself
to
be
set
right
and
if
you
can
not
do
so
to
his
mind
you
shall
be
off
the
bargain
but
papa
percivale
both
of
you
know
well
enough
that
nothing
ever
happened
to
me
worth
telling
i
am
sorry
your
life
has
been
so
very
uninteresting
wife
said
my
husband
grimly
for
his
fun
is
always
so
like
earnest
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
husband
it
does
follow
that
what
has
been
interesting
enough
to
you
and
me
will
be
interesting
to
people
who
know
nothing
at
all
about
us
to
begin
with
it
depends
on
how
it
is
told
said
then
i
beg
leave
to
say
that
i
never
had
an
original
thought
in
my
life
and
that
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
tell
my
history
the
result
would
be
as
silly
a
narrative
as
ever
one
old
woman
told
another
by
the
workhouse
fire
and
i
only
wish
i
could
hear
the
one
old
woman
tell
her
story
to
the
other
said
my
father
ah
but
that
because
you
see
ever
so
much
more
in
it
than
shows
you
always
see
through
the
words
and
the
things
to
something
lying
behind
them
i
said
well
if
you
told
the
story
rightly
other
people
would
see
such
things
behind
it
too
not
enough
of
people
to
make
it
worth
while
for
to
print
it
i
said
he
not
going
to
print
it
except
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while
and
you
may
safely
leave
that
to
him
said
my
husband
and
so
i
to
write
a
book
as
big
as
annals
and
after
i
been
slaving
at
it
for
half
a
century
or
so
i
to
be
told
it
wo
do
and
all
my
labor
must
go
for
nothing
i
must
say
the
proposal
is
rather
a
cool
one
to
make
to
the
mother
of
a
family
not
at
all
that
not
it
i
mean
said
if
you
will
write
a
dozen
pages
or
so
i
shall
be
able
to
judge
by
those
well
enough
at
least
i
will
take
all
the
responsibility
on
myself
after
that
there
a
fair
offer
said
my
husband
it
seems
to
me
wynnie
that
all
that
is
wanted
of
you
is
to
tell
your
tale
so
that
other
people
can
recognize
the
human
heart
in
it
the
heart
that
is
like
their
own
and
be
able
to
feel
as
if
they
were
themselves
going
through
the
things
you
recount
you
describe
the
work
of
a
genius
and
coolly
ask
me
to
do
it
besides
i
do
want
to
be
set
thinking
about
my
heart
and
all
that
i
said
peevishly
now
do
be
raising
objections
where
none
exist
he
returned
if
you
mean
i
am
pretending
to
object
i
have
only
to
say
that
i
feel
all
one
great
objection
to
the
whole
affair
and
that
i
wo
touch
it
they
were
all
silent
and
i
felt
as
if
i
had
behaved
ungraciously
then
first
i
felt
as
if
i
might
to
do
it
after
all
but
i
could
see
my
way
in
the
least
now
what
is
there
i
asked
in
all
my
life
that
is
worth
setting
down
i
mean
as
i
should
be
able
to
set
it
down
what
do
you
ladies
talk
about
now
in
your
morning
calls
suggested
blackstone
with
a
humorous
glance
from
his
deep
black
eyes
nothing
worth
writing
about
as
i
am
sure
will
readily
believe
blackstone
i
answered
how
comes
it
to
be
interesting
then
but
it
is
they
we
only
talk
about
the
weather
and
our
children
and
servants
and
that
sort
of
thing
said
and
i
wish
i
could
get
any
thing
sensible
about
the
weather
and
children
and
servants
and
that
sort
of
thing
for
my
magazine
i
have
a
weakness
in
the
direction
of
the
sensible
but
there
never
is
any
thing
sensible
said
about
any
of
them
not
that
i
know
of
now
wynnie
i
am
sure
you
are
wrong
said
my
father
there
is
your
friend
cromwell
i
am
certain
she
sometimes
at
least
must
say
what
is
worth
hearing
about
such
matters
well
but
she
an
exception
besides
she
has
any
children
then
said
my
husband
there
lady
bernard
ah
but
she
was
like
no
one
else
besides
she
is
almost
a
public
character
and
any
thing
said
about
her
would
betray
my
original
it
would
be
no
matter
she
is
beyond
caring
for
that
now
and
not
one
of
her
friends
could
object
to
any
thing
you
who
loved
her
so
much
would
say
about
her
the
mention
of
this
lady
seemed
to
put
some
strength
into
me
i
felt
as
if
i
did
know
something
worth
telling
and
i
was
silent
in
my
turn
certainly
resumed
whatever
is
worth
talking
about
is
worth
writing
about
though
not
perhaps
in
the
way
it
is
talked
about
besides
percivale
my
clients
want
to
know
more
about
your
sisters
and
little
theodora
or
dorothea
or
what
was
her
name
in
the
book
the
end
of
it
was
that
i
agreed
to
try
to
the
extent
of
a
dozen
pages
or
so
chapter
ii
i
try
i
hope
no
one
will
think
i
try
to
write
like
my
father
for
that
would
be
to
go
against
what
he
always
made
a
great
point
of
that
nobody
whatever
should
imitate
any
other
person
whatever
but
in
modesty
and
humility
allow
the
seed
that
god
had
sown
in
her
to
grow
he
said
all
imitation
tended
to
dwarf
and
distort
the
plant
if
it
even
allowed
the
seed
to
germinate
at
all
so
if
i
do
write
like
him
it
will
be
because
i
can
not
help
it
i
will
just
look
how
the
seaboard
parish
ends
and
perhaps
that
will
put
into
my
head
how
i
ought
to
begin
i
see
my
father
does
mention
that
i
had
then
been
percivale
for
many
years
not
so
very
many
though
five
or
six
if
i
remember
rightly
and
that
is
three
or
four
years
ago
yes
i
nave
been
married
nine
years
i
may
as
well
say
a
word
as
to
how
it
came
about
and
if
percivale
does
like
it
the
remedy
lies
in
his
pen
i
shall
be
far
more
thankful
to
have
any
thing
struck
out
on
suspicion
than
remain
on
sufferance
after
our
return
home
from
kilkhaven
my
father
and
mother
had
a
good
many
talks
about
me
and
percivale
and
sometimes
they
took
different
sides
i
will
give
a
shadow
of
one
of
these
conversations
i
think
ladies
can
write
fully
as
natural
talk
as
gentlemen
can
though
the
bits
between
may
be
so
good
i
am
afraid
my
dear
husband
this
was
my
mother
most
solemn
mode
of
addressing
my
father
they
are
too
like
each
other
to
make
a
suitable
match
i
am
sorry
to
learn
you
consider
me
so
very
unlike
yourself
ethelwyn
i
had
hoped
there
was
a
very
strong
resemblance
indeed
and
that
the
match
had
not
proved
altogether
unsuitable
just
think
though
what
would
have
become
of
me
by
this
time
if
you
had
been
half
as
unbelieving
a
creature
as
i
was
indeed
i
fear
sometimes
i
am
not
much
better
now
i
think
i
am
then
and
i
know
you
done
me
nothing
but
good
with
your
unbelief
it
was
just
because
i
was
of
the
same
sort
precisely
that
i
was
able
to
understand
and
help
you
my
circumstances
and
education
and
superior
years
now
do
plume
yourself
on
that
harry
for
you
know
everybody
says
you
look
much
the
younger
of
the
two
i
had
no
idea
that
everybody
was
so
rude
i
repeat
that
my
more
years
as
well
as
my
severer
education
had
no
doubt
helped
me
a
little
further
on
before
i
came
to
know
you
but
it
was
only
in
virtue
of
the
doubt
in
me
that
i
was
able
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
doubt
in
you
but
then
you
had
at
least
begun
to
leave
it
behind
before
i
knew
you
and
so
had
grown
able
to
help
me
and
percivale
does
not
seem
by
all
i
can
make
out
a
bit
nearer
believing
in
any
thing
than
poor
wynnie
herself
at
least
he
does
fancy
he
believes
when
he
does
not
as
so
many
do
and
consider
themselves
superior
persons
in
consequence
i
know
that
it
would
have
done
you
any
great
harm
miss
ethelwyn
to
have
made
my
acquaintance
when
i
was
in
the
worst
of
my
doubts
concerning
the
truth
of
things
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
was
nearer
making
shipwreck
of
my
faith
at
a
certain
period
than
i
ever
was
before
or
have
been
since
what
period
was
that
just
the
little
while
when
i
had
lost
all
hope
of
ever
marrying
you
unbeliever
as
you
counted
yourself
you
do
mean
to
say
you
would
have
ceased
to
believe
in
god
if
he
had
given
you
your
own
way
no
my
dear
i
firmly
believe
that
had
i
never
married
you
i
should
have
come
in
the
end
to
say
will
be
and
to
believe
that
it
must
be
all
right
however
hard
to
bear
but
oh
what
a
terrible
thing
it
would
have
been
and
what
a
frightful
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
i
should
have
had
to
go
through
first
i
know
my
mother
nothing
more
just
then
but
let
my
father
have
it
all
his
own
way
for
a
while
you
see
this
percivale
is
an
honest
man
i
do
exactly
know
how
he
has
been
brought
up
and
it
is
quite
possible
he
may
have
had
such
evil
instruction
in
christianity
that
he
attributes
to
it
doctrines
which
if
i
supposed
they
actually
belonged
to
it
would
make
me
reject
it
at
once
as
ungodlike
and
bad
i
have
found
this
the
case
sometimes
i
remember
once
being
astonished
to
hear
a
certain
lady
utter
some
indignant
words
against
what
i
considered
a
very
weighty
doctrine
of
christianity
but
listening
i
soon
found
that
what
she
supposed
the
doctrine
to
contain
was
something
considered
vastly
unchristian
this
may
be
the
case
with
percivale
though
i
never
heard
him
say
a
word
of
the
kind
i
think
his
difficulty
comes
mainly
from
seeing
so
much
suffering
in
the
world
that
he
can
not
imagine
the
presence
and
rule
of
a
good
god
and
therefore
lies
with
religion
rather
than
with
christianity
as
yet
i
am
all
but
certain
the
only
thing
that
will
ever
make
him
able
to
believe
in
a
god
at
all
is
meditation
on
the
christian
idea
of
god
i
mean
the
idea
of
god
christ
reconciling
the
world
to
himself
not
that
pagan
corruption
of
christ
in
god
reconciling
him
to
the
world
he
will
then
see
that
suffering
is
not
either
wrath
or
neglect
but
love
and
tenderness
but
we
must
give
him
time
wife
as
god
has
borne
with
us
we
must
believe
that
he
bears
with
others
and
so
learn
to
wait
in
hopeful
patience
until
they
too
see
as
we
see
and
as
to
trusting
our
wynnie
with
percivale
he
seems
to
be
as
good
as
she
is
i
should
for
my
part
have
more
apprehension
in
giving
her
to
one
who
would
be
called
a
thoroughly
religious
man
for
not
only
would
the
unfitness
be
greater
but
such
a
man
would
be
more
likely
to
confirm
her
in
doubt
if
the
phrase
be
permissible
she
wants
what
some
would
call
homoeopathic
treatment
and
how
should
they
be
able
to
love
one
another
if
they
are
not
fit
to
be
married
to
each
other
the
fitness
seems
inherent
to
the
fact
but
many
a
two
love
each
other
who
would
have
loved
each
other
a
good
deal
more
if
they
had
been
married
then
it
was
most
desirable
they
should
find
out
that
what
they
thought
a
grand
affection
was
not
worthy
of
the
name
but
i
do
think
there
is
much
fear
of
that
between
those
two
i
do
however
see
how
that
man
is
to
do
her
any
good
when
have
tried
to
make
her
happy
for
so
long
and
all
in
vain
i
do
know
that
it
has
been
all
in
vain
but
it
is
quite
possible
she
does
not
understand
me
she
fancies
i
dare
say
that
i
believe
every
thing
without
any
trouble
and
therefore
can
not
enter
into
her
difficulties
but
you
have
told
her
many
and
many
a
time
that
you
do
yes
and
i
hope
i
was
right
but
the
same
things
look
so
different
to
different
people
that
the
same
words
wo
describe
them
to
both
and
it
may
seem
to
her
that
i
am
talking
of
something
not
at
all
like
what
she
is
feeling
or
thinking
of
but
when
she
sees
the
troubled
face
of
percivale
she
knows
that
he
is
suffering
and
sympathy
being
thus
established
between
them
the
least
word
of
the
one
will
do
more
to
help
the
other
than
oceans
of
argument
love
is
the
one
great
instructor
and
each
will
try
to
be
good
and
to
find
out
for
the
sake
of
the
other
i
do
like
her
going
from
home
for
the
help
that
lay
at
her
very
door
you
know
my
dear
you
like
the
dean
preaching
much
better
than
mine
now
that
is
unkind
of
you
and
why
my
father
went
on
taking
no
heed
of
my
expostulation
because
in
the
first
place
it
better
because
in
the
second
it
comes
in
a
newer
form
to
you
for
you
have
got
used
to
all
my
modes
in
the
third
place
it
has
more
force
from
the
fact
that
it
is
not
subject
to
the
doubt
of
personal
preference
and
lastly
because
he
has
a
large
comprehensive
way
of
asserting
things
which
pleases
you
better
than
my
more
dubitant
mode
of
submitting
them
all
very
sound
and
good
reasons
but
still
why
be
so
vexed
with
wynnie
my
mother
was
now
however
so
vexed
with
my
father
for
saying
she
preferred
the
dean
preaching
to
his
although
i
doubt
very
much
whether
it
was
true
that
she
actually
walked
out
of
the
octagon
room
where
they
were
and
left
him
to
meditate
on
his
unkindness
vexed
with
herself
the
next
moment
she
returned
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
am
only
telling
what
my
mother
told
me
for
to
her
grown
daughters
she
is
blessedly
trusting
then
if
you
will
have
them
married
husband
will
you
say
how
on
earth
you
expect
them
to
live
he
just
makes
both
ends
meet
now
i
suppose
he
does
make
things
out
worse
than
they
are
and
that
is
his
own
account
of
the
state
of
his
affairs
ah
yes
that
a
secondary
consideration
my
dear
but
i
have
hardly
begun
to
think
about
it
yet
there
will
be
a
difficulty
there
i
can
easily
imagine
for
he
is
far
too
independent
to
let
us
do
any
thing
for
him
and
you
ca
do
much
if
they
would
really
they
ought
to
marry
yet
really
we
must
leave
it
to
themselves
i
do
think
you
and
i
need
trouble
our
heads
about
it
when
percivale
considers
himself
prepared
to
marry
and
wynnie
thinks
he
is
right
you
may
be
sure
they
see
their
way
to
a
livelihood
without
running
in
hopeless
debt
to
their
tradespeople
oh
yes
i
dare
say
in
some
poky
little
lodging
or
other
for
my
part
ethelwyn
i
think
it
better
to
build
castles
in
the
air
than
huts
in
the
smoke
but
seriously
a
little
poverty
and
a
little
struggling
would
be
a
most
healthy
and
healing
thing
for
wynnie
it
done
percivale
much
good
yet
i
confess
for
he
is
far
too
indifferent
to
his
own
comforts
to
mind
it
but
it
will
be
quite
another
thing
when
he
has
a
young
wife
and
perhaps
children
depending
upon
him
then
his
poverty
may
begin
to
hurt
him
and
so
do
him
some
good
it
may
seem
odd
that
my
father
and
mother
should
now
be
taking
such
opposite
sides
to
those
they
took
when
the
question
of
our
engagement
was
first
started
as
represented
by
my
father
in
the
seaboard
parish
but
it
will
seem
inconsistent
to
none
of
the
family
for
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
them
to
take
opposite
sides
to
those
they
had
previously
advocated
each
happening
at
the
time
possibly
enlightened
by
the
foregone
arguments
of
the
other
to
be
impressed
with
the
correlate
truth
as
my
father
calls
the
other
side
of
a
thing
besides
engagement
and
marriage
are
two
different
things
and
although
my
mother
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
good
of
our
being
engaged
when
it
came
to
marriage
she
got
frightened
i
think
any
how
i
have
her
authority
for
saying
that
something
like
this
passed
between
her
and
my
father
on
the
subject
discussion
between
them
differed
in
this
from
what
i
have
generally
heard
between
married
people
that
it
was
always
founded
on
a
tacit
understanding
of
certain
unmentioned
principles
and
no
doubt
sometimes
if
a
stranger
had
been
present
he
would
have
been
bewildered
as
to
the
very
meaning
of
what
they
were
saying
but
we
girls
generally
understood
and
i
fancy
we
learned
more
from
their
differences
than
from
their
agreements
for
of
course
it
was
the
differences
that
brought
out
their
minds
most
and
chiefly
led
us
to
think
that
we
might
understand
in
our
house
there
were
very
few
of
those
mysteries
which
in
some
houses
seem
so
to
abound
and
i
think
the
openness
with
which
every
question
for
whose
concealment
there
was
no
special
reason
was
discussed
did
more
than
even
any
direct
instruction
we
received
to
develop
what
thinking
faculty
might
be
in
us
nor
was
there
much
reason
to
dread
that
my
small
brothers
might
repeat
any
thing
i
remember
hearing
harry
say
to
charley
once
they
being
then
eight
and
nine
years
old
that
is
mamma
opinion
charley
not
yours
and
you
know
we
must
not
repeat
what
we
hear
they
soon
came
to
be
of
one
mind
about
percivale
and
me
for
indeed
the
only
ground
for
doubt
that
had
ever
existed
was
whether
i
was
good
enough
for
him
and
for
my
part
i
knew
then
and
know
now
that
i
was
and
am
dreadfully
inferior
to
him
and
notwithstanding
the
tremendous
work
women
are
now
making
about
their
rights
and
in
as
far
as
they
are
their
rights
i
hope
to
goodness
they
may
get
them
if
it
were
only
that
certain
who
make
me
feel
ashamed
of
myself
because
i
too
am
a
woman
might
perhaps
then
drop
out
of
the
public
regard
notwithstanding
this
i
venture
the
sweeping
assertion
that
every
woman
is
not
as
good
as
every
man
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
dignity
of
a
wife
that
she
should
assert
even
equality
with
her
husband
let
him
assert
her
equality
or
superiority
if
he
will
but
were
it
a
fact
it
would
be
a
poor
one
for
her
to
assert
seeing
her
glory
is
in
her
husband
to
seek
the
chief
place
is
especially
unfitting
the
whether
i
be
a
christian
or
not
and
i
have
good
reason
to
doubt
it
every
day
of
my
life
at
least
i
see
that
in
the
new
jerusalem
one
essential
of
citizenship
consists
in
knowing
how
to
set
the
good
in
others
over
against
the
evil
in
ourselves
there
now
my
father
might
have
said
that
and
no
doubt
has
said
so
twenty
times
in
my
hearing
it
is
however
only
since
i
was
married
that
i
have
come
to
see
it
for
myself
and
now
that
i
do
see
it
i
have
a
right
to
say
it
so
we
were
married
at
last
my
mother
believes
it
was
my
father
good
advice
to
percivale
concerning
the
sort
of
pictures
he
painted
that
brought
it
about
for
certainly
soon
after
we
were
engaged
he
began
to
have
what
his
artist
friends
called
a
run
of
luck
he
sold
one
picture
after
another
in
a
very
extraordinary
and
hopeful
manner
but
percivale
says
it
was
his
love
for
me
indeed
he
does
which
enabled
him
to
see
not
only
much
deeper
into
things
but
also
to
see
much
better
the
bloom
that
hangs
about
every
thing
and
so
to
paint
much
better
pictures
than
before
he
felt
he
said
that
he
had
a
hold
now
where
before
he
had
only
a
sight
however
this
may
be
he
had
got
on
so
well
for
a
while
that
he
wrote
at
last
that
if
i
was
willing
to
share
his
poverty
it
would
not
he
thought
be
absolute
starvation
and
i
was
of
course
perfectly
content
i
ca
put
in
words
indeed
i
dare
not
for
fear
of
writing
what
would
be
if
not
unladylike
at
least
uncharitable
my
contempt
for
those
women
who
loving
a
man
hesitate
to
run
every
risk
with
him
of
course
if
they
can
not
trust
him
it
is
a
different
thing
i
am
not
going
to
say
any
thing
about
that
for
i
should
be
out
of
my
depth
not
in
the
least
understanding
how
a
woman
can
love
a
man
to
whom
she
can
not
look
up
i
believe
there
are
who
can
i
see
some
men
married
whom
i
do
believe
any
woman
ever
did
or
ever
could
respect
all
i
say
is
i
do
understand
it
my
father
and
mother
made
no
objection
and
were
evidently
at
last
quite
agreed
that
it
would
be
the
best
thing
for
both
of
us
and
so
i
say
we
were
married
i
ought
to
just
mention
that
before
the
day
arrived
my
mother
went
up
to
london
at
percivale
request
to
help
him
in
getting
together
the
few
things
absolutely
needful
for
the
barest
commencement
of
housekeeping
for
the
rest
it
had
been
arranged
that
we
should
furnish
by
degrees
buying
as
we
saw
what
we
liked
and
could
afford
it
the
greater
part
of
modern
fashions
in
furniture
having
both
been
accustomed
to
the
stateliness
of
a
more
artistic
period
we
detested
for
their
ugliness
and
chiefly
therefore
we
desired
to
look
about
us
at
our
leisure
my
mother
came
back
more
satisfied
with
the
little
house
he
had
taken
than
i
had
expected
it
was
not
so
easy
to
get
one
to
suit
us
for
of
course
he
required
a
large
room
to
paint
in
with
a
good
north
light
he
had
however
succeeded
better
than
he
had
hoped
you
will
find
things
very
different
from
what
you
have
been
used
to
wynnie
said
my
mother
of
course
mamma
i
know
that
i
answered
i
hope
i
am
prepared
to
meet
it
if
i
do
like
it
i
shall
have
no
one
to
blame
but
myself
and
i
do
see
what
right
people
have
to
expect
what
they
have
been
used
to
there
is
just
this
advantage
said
my
father
in
having
been
used
to
nice
things
that
it
ought
to
be
easier
to
keep
from
sinking
into
the
sordid
however
straitened
the
new
circumstances
may
be
compared
with
the
old
on
the
evening
before
the
wedding
my
father
took
me
into
the
octagon
room
and
there
knelt
down
with
me
and
my
mother
and
prayed
for
me
in
such
a
wonderful
way
that
i
was
perfectly
astonished
and
overcome
i
had
never
known
him
to
do
any
thing
of
the
kind
before
he
was
not
favorable
to
extempore
prayer
in
public
or
even
in
the
family
and
indeed
had
often
seemed
willing
to
omit
prayers
for
what
i
could
not
always
count
sufficient
reason
he
had
a
horror
at
their
getting
to
be
a
matter
of
course
and
a
form
for
then
he
said
they
ceased
to
be
worship
at
all
and
were
a
mere
pagan
rite
better
far
left
alone
i
remember
also
he
said
that
those
however
good
they
might
be
who
urged
attention
to
the
forms
of
religion
such
as
going
to
church
and
saying
prayers
were
however
innocently
just
the
prophets
of
pharisaism
that
what
men
had
to
be
stirred
up
to
was
to
lay
hold
upon
god
and
then
they
would
not
fail
to
find
out
what
religious
forms
they
ought
to
cherish
the
spirit
first
and
then
the
flesh
he
would
say
to
put
the
latter
before
the
former
was
a
falsehood
and
therefore
a
frightful
danger
being
at
the
root
of
all
declensions
in
the
church
and
making
earthquakes
and
persecutions
and
repentances
and
reformations
needful
i
find
what
my
father
used
to
say
coming
back
so
often
now
that
i
hear
so
little
of
it
especially
as
he
talks
much
less
accusing
himself
of
having
always
talked
too
much
and
i
understand
it
so
much
better
now
that
i
shall
be
always
in
danger
of
interrupting
my
narrative
to
say
something
that
he
said
but
when
i
commence
the
next
chapter
i
shall
get
on
faster
i
hope
my
story
is
like
a
vessel
i
saw
once
being
launched
it
would
stick
on
the
stocks
instead
of
sliding
away
into
the
expectant
waters
chapter
iii
my
wedding
i
confess
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
knew
myself
the
next
morning
was
to
have
a
good
cry
to
leave
the
place
where
i
had
been
born
was
like
forsaking
the
laws
and
order
of
the
nature
i
knew
for
some
other
nature
it
might
be
but
not
known
to
me
as
such
how
for
instance
could
one
who
has
been
used
to
our
bright
white
sun
and
our
pale
modest
moon
with
our
soft
twilights
and
far
mysterious
skies
of
night
be
willing
to
fall
in
with
the
order
of
things
in
a
planet
such
as
i
have
read
of
somewhere
with
three
or
four
suns
one
red
and
another
green
and
another
yellow
only
perhaps
i
taken
it
all
up
wrong
and
i
do
like
looking
at
a
landscape
for
a
minute
or
so
through
a
colored
glass
and
if
it
be
so
of
course
it
all
blends
and
all
we
want
is
harmony
what
i
mean
is
that
i
found
it
a
great
wrench
to
leave
the
dear
old
place
and
of
course
loved
it
more
than
i
had
ever
loved
it
but
i
would
get
all
my
crying
about
that
over
beforehand
it
would
be
bad
enough
afterwards
to
have
to
part
with
my
father
and
mother
and
connie
and
the
rest
of
them
only
it
was
like
leaving
them
you
ca
leave
hearts
as
you
do
rooms
you
ca
leave
thoughts
as
you
do
books
those
you
love
only
come
nearer
to
you
when
you
go
away
from
them
the
same
rules
do
hold
with
and
as
my
eldest
boy
distinguished
them
the
other
day
but
somehow
i
could
get
up
and
dress
i
seemed
to
have
got
very
fond
of
my
own
bed
and
the
queer
old
crows
as
i
had
called
them
from
babyhood
on
the
chintz
curtains
and
the
chinese
paper
on
the
walk
with
the
strangest
birds
and
creeping
things
on
it
it
was
a
lovely
spring
morning
and
the
sun
was
shining
gloriously
i
knew
that
the
rain
of
the
last
night
must
be
glittering
on
the
grass
and
the
young
leaves
and
i
heard
the
birds
singing
as
if
they
knew
far
more
than
mere
human
beings
and
believed
a
great
deal
more
than
they
knew
nobody
will
persuade
me
that
the
birds
do
mean
it
that
they
sing
from
any
thing
else
than
gladness
of
heart
and
if
they
do
think
about
cats
and
guns
why
should
they
even
when
they
fall
on
the
ground
it
is
not
without
our
father
how
horridly
dull
and
stupid
it
seems
to
say
that
without
your
father
means
without
knowing
the
father
mere
of
a
thing
if
that
could
be
which
my
father
says
ca
is
not
the
father
the
father
tenderness
and
care
and
love
of
it
all
the
time
that
is
the
not
falling
without
him
when
the
cat
kills
the
bird
as
i
have
seen
happen
so
often
in
our
poor
little
london
garden
god
yet
saves
his
bird
from
his
cat
there
is
nothing
so
bad
as
it
looks
to
our
our
blinding
perceptions
my
father
used
to
say
we
are
all
walking
in
a
spiritual
twilight
and
are
all
more
or
less
affected
with
twilight
blindness
as
some
people
are
physically
percivale
for
one
who
is
as
brave
as
any
wife
could
wish
is
far
more
timid
than
i
am
in
crossing
a
london
street
in
the
twilight
he
ca
see
what
is
coming
and
fancies
he
sees
what
is
not
coming
but
then
he
has
faith
in
me
and
never
starts
when
i
am
leading
him
well
the
birds
were
singing
and
dora
and
the
boys
were
making
a
great
chatter
like
a
whole
colony
of
sparrows
under
my
window
still
i
felt
as
if
i
had
twenty
questions
to
settle
before
i
could
get
up
comfortably
and
so
lay
on
and
on
till
the
rang
and
i
was
not
more
than
half
dressed
when
my
mother
came
to
see
why
i
was
late
for
i
had
not
been
late
forever
so
long
before
she
comforted
me
as
nobody
but
a
mother
can
comfort
oh
i
do
hope
i
shall
be
to
my
children
what
my
mother
has
been
to
me
it
would
be
such
a
blessed
thing
to
be
a
well
of
water
whence
they
may
be
sure
of
drawing
comfort
and
all
she
said
to
me
has
come
true
of
course
my
father
gave
me
away
and
weir
married
us
it
had
been
before
agreed
that
we
should
have
no
wedding
journey
we
all
liked
the
plan
of
the
bride
going
straight
from
her
house
to
her
husband
the
other
way
seemed
a
poor
invention
just
for
the
sake
of
something
different
so
after
the
wedding
we
spent
the
time
as
we
should
have
done
any
other
day
wandering
about
in
groups
or
sitting
and
reading
only
that
we
were
all
more
smartly
dressed
until
it
was
time
for
an
early
dinner
after
which
we
drove
to
the
station
accompanied
only
by
my
father
and
mother
after
they
left
us
or
rather
we
left
them
my
husband
did
not
speak
to
me
for
nearly
an
hour
i
knew
why
and
was
very
grateful
he
would
not
show
his
new
face
in
the
midst
of
my
old
loves
and
their
sorrows
but
would
give
me
time
to
the
grouping
so
as
myself
to
bring
him
in
when
all
was
ready
for
him
i
know
that
was
what
he
was
thinking
or
feeling
rather
and
i
understood
him
perfectly
at
last
when
i
had
got
things
a
little
tidier
inside
me
and
had
got
my
eyes
to
stop
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
and
then
knew
that
i
was
his
wife
this
is
all
i
have
got
to
tell
though
i
have
plenty
more
to
keep
till
we
get
to
london
there
instead
of
my
father
nice
carriage
we
got
into
a
jolting
lumbering
horrid
cab
with
my
five
boxes
and
percivale
little
portmanteau
on
the
top
of
it
and
drove
away
to
camden
town
it
to
a
part
of
it
near
the
regent
park
and
so
our
letters
were
always
according
to
the
divisions
of
the
addressed
to
regent
park
but
for
all
practical
intents
we
were
in
camden
town
it
was
indeed
a
change
from
a
fine
old
house
in
the
country
but
the
street
was
much
uglier
than
belgrave
square
or
any
other
of
those
heaps
of
uglinesses
called
squares
in
the
west
end
and
after
what
i
had
been
told
to
expect
i
was
surprised
at
the
prettiness
of
the
little
house
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
cab
and
looked
about
me
it
was
stuck
on
like
a
swallow
nest
to
the
end
of
a
great
row
of
commonplace
houses
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
but
itself
was
not
the
work
of
one
of
those
wretched
builders
who
care
no
more
for
beauty
in
what
they
build
than
a
scavenger
in
the
heap
of
mud
he
scrapes
from
the
street
it
had
been
built
by
a
painter
for
himself
in
the
tudor
style
and
though
percivale
says
the
idea
is
not
very
well
carried
out
i
like
it
much
i
found
it
a
little
dreary
when
i
entered
though
from
its
emptiness
the
only
at
all
prepared
had
just
a
table
and
two
or
three
chairs
in
it
not
even
a
carpet
on
the
floor
the
bedroom
and
were
also
as
scantily
furnished
as
they
well
could
be
do
be
dismayed
my
darling
said
my
husband
look
here
showing
me
a
bunch
of
notes
we
shall
go
out
and
buy
all
we
want
as
far
as
this
will
go
and
then
wait
for
the
rest
it
will
be
such
a
pleasure
to
buy
the
things
with
you
and
see
them
come
home
and
have
you
appoint
their
places
you
and
sarah
will
make
the
carpets
wo
you
and
i
will
put
them
down
and
we
shall
be
like
birds
building
their
nest
we
have
only
to
line
it
the
nest
is
built
already
well
neither
do
the
birds
build
the
tree
i
wonder
if
they
ever
sit
in
their
old
summer
nests
in
the
winter
nights
i
am
afraid
not
i
answered
but
i
ashamed
to
say
i
ca
tell
it
is
the
only
pretty
house
i
know
in
all
london
he
went
on
with
a
studio
at
the
back
of
it
i
have
had
my
eye
on
it
for
a
long
time
but
there
seemed
no
sign
of
a
migratory
disposition
in
the
bird
who
had
occupied
it
for
three
years
past
all
at
once
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
i
count
myself
very
fortunate
so
do
i
but
now
you
must
let
me
see
your
study
i
said
i
hope
i
may
sit
in
it
when
you
got
nobody
there
as
much
as
ever
you
like
my
love
he
answered
only
i
do
want
to
make
all
my
women
like
you
as
i
been
doing
for
the
last
two
years
you
must
get
me
out
of
that
somehow
easily
i
shall
be
so
cross
and
disagreeable
that
you
will
get
tired
of
me
and
find
no
more
difficulty
in
keeping
me
out
of
your
pictures
but
he
got
me
out
of
his
pictures
without
that
for
when
he
had
me
always
before
him
he
did
want
to
be
always
producing
me
he
led
me
into
the
little
hall
made
lovely
by
a
cast
of
an
unfinished
madonna
of
michael
angelo
let
into
the
wall
and
then
to
the
back
of
it
where
he
opened
a
small
door
when
there
yawned
before
me
below
me
and
above
me
a
great
wide
lofty
room
down
into
it
led
an
almost
perpendicular
stair
so
you
keep
a
little
private
precipice
here
i
said
no
my
dear
he
returned
you
mistake
it
is
a
jacob
ladder
or
will
be
in
one
moment
more
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
led
me
down
this
is
quite
a
percivale
i
cried
looking
round
me
it
shall
be
the
first
time
i
get
a
thousand
pounds
for
a
picture
he
returned
how
grand
you
talk
i
said
looking
up
at
him
with
some
wonder
for
big
words
rarely
came
out
of
his
mouth
well
he
answered
merrily
i
had
two
hundred
and
for
the
last
that
a
long
way
off
a
thousand
i
returned
with
a
silly
sigh
quite
right
and
therefore
this
study
is
a
long
way
off
a
there
was
literally
nothing
inside
the
seventeen
feet
cube
except
one
chair
one
easel
a
horrible
thing
like
a
huge
doll
with
no
end
of
joints
called
a
lay
figure
but
percivale
called
it
his
bishop
a
number
of
pictures
leaning
their
faces
against
the
walls
in
attitudes
of
grief
that
their
beauty
was
despised
and
no
man
would
buy
them
a
few
casts
of
legs
and
arms
and
faces
half
a
dozen
weapons
and
a
couple
of
yards
square
of
the
most
exquisite
tapestry
i
ever
saw
do
you
like
being
read
to
when
you
are
at
work
i
asked
him
sometimes
at
certain
kinds
of
work
but
not
by
any
means
always
he
answered
will
you
shut
your
eyes
for
one
minute
he
went
on
and
whatever
i
do
not
open
them
till
i
tell
you
you
must
hurt
me
then
or
i
may
open
them
without
being
able
to
help
it
you
know
i
said
closing
my
eyes
tight
hurt
you
he
repeated
with
a
tone
i
would
not
put
on
paper
if
i
could
and
the
same
moment
i
found
myself
in
his
arms
carried
like
a
baby
for
percivale
is
one
of
the
strongest
of
men
it
was
only
for
a
few
yards
however
he
laid
me
down
somewhere
and
told
me
to
open
my
eyes
i
could
scarcely
believe
them
when
i
did
i
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
a
room
small
indeed
but
beyond
exception
the
loveliest
i
had
ever
seen
at
first
i
was
only
aware
of
an
exquisite
harmony
of
color
and
could
not
have
told
of
what
it
was
composed
the
place
was
lighted
by
a
soft
lamp
that
hung
in
the
middle
and
when
my
eyes
went
up
to
see
where
it
was
fastened
i
found
the
ceiling
marvellous
in
deep
blue
with
a
suspicion
of
green
just
like
some
of
the
shades
of
a
peacock
feathers
with
a
multitude
of
gold
and
red
stars
upon
it
what
the
walls
were
i
could
not
for
some
time
tell
they
were
so
covered
with
pictures
and
sketches
against
one
was
a
lovely
little
set
of
filled
with
books
and
on
a
little
carved
table
stood
a
vase
of
white
flowers
with
one
red
camellia
one
picture
had
a
curtain
of
green
silk
before
it
and
by
its
side
hung
the
wounded
knight
whom
his
friends
were
carrying
home
to
die
o
my
percivale
i
cried
and
could
say
no
more
do
you
like
it
he
asked
quietly
but
with
shining
eyes
like
it
i
repeated
shall
i
like
paradise
when
i
get
there
but
what
a
lot
of
money
it
must
have
cost
you
not
much
he
answered
not
more
than
thirty
pounds
or
so
every
spot
of
paint
there
is
from
my
own
brush
o
percivale
i
must
make
a
conversation
of
it
to
tell
it
at
all
but
what
i
really
did
say
i
know
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
the
carpet
was
the
only
expensive
thing
that
must
be
as
thick
as
i
could
get
it
for
the
floor
is
of
stone
and
must
not
come
near
your
pretty
feet
guess
what
the
place
was
before
i
should
say
the
flower
of
a
cactus
full
of
sunlight
from
behind
which
a
fairy
took
the
fancy
to
swell
into
a
room
it
was
a
shed
in
which
the
sculptor
who
occupied
the
place
before
me
used
to
keep
his
wet
clay
and
blocks
of
marble
seeing
is
hardly
believing
i
said
is
it
to
be
my
room
i
know
you
mean
it
for
my
room
where
i
can
ask
you
to
come
when
i
please
and
where
i
can
hide
when
any
one
comes
you
do
want
me
to
see
that
is
just
what
i
meant
it
for
my
ethelwyn
and
to
let
you
know
what
i
do
for
you
if
i
could
i
hate
the
place
percivale
i
said
what
right
has
it
to
come
poking
in
between
you
and
me
telling
me
what
i
know
and
have
known
for
well
i
wo
say
how
long
far
better
than
even
you
can
tell
me
he
looked
a
little
troubled
ah
my
dear
i
said
let
my
foolish
words
breathe
and
die
i
wonder
sometimes
to
think
how
seldom
i
am
in
that
room
now
but
there
it
is
and
somehow
i
seem
to
know
it
all
the
time
i
am
busy
elsewhere
he
made
me
shut
my
eyes
again
and
carried
me
into
the
study
now
he
said
find
your
way
to
your
own
room
i
looked
about
me
but
could
see
no
sign
of
door
he
took
up
a
tall
stretcher
with
a
canvas
on
it
and
revealed
the
door
at
the
same
time
showing
a
likeness
of
myself
at
the
top
of
the
jacob
ladder
as
he
called
it
with
me
foot
on
the
first
step
and
the
other
half
way
to
the
second
the
light
came
from
the
window
on
my
left
which
he
had
turned
into
a
western
window
in
order
to
get
certain
effects
from
a
supposed
sunset
i
was
represented
in
a
white
dress
tinged
with
the
rose
of
the
west
and
he
had
managed
attributing
the
phenomenon
to
the
inequalities
of
the
glass
in
the
window
to
suggest
one
rosy
wing
behind
me
with
just
the
of
another
visible
there
he
said
it
is
not
finished
yet
but
that
is
how
i
saw
you
one
evening
as
i
was
sitting
here
all
alone
in
the
twilight
but
you
did
really
see
me
like
that
i
said
i
hardly
know
he
answered
i
had
been
forgetting
every
thing
else
in
dreaming
about
you
and
how
it
was
i
can
not
tell
but
either
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
there
i
saw
you
standing
just
so
at
the
top
of
the
stair
smiling
to
me
as
much
as
to
say
patience
my
foot
is
on
the
first
step
i
coming
i
turned
at
once
to
my
easel
and
before
the
twilight
was
gone
had
sketched
the
vision
you
must
sit
to
me
for
an
hour
or
so
for
i
will
do
nothing
else
till
i
have
finished
it
and
sent
it
off
to
your
father
and
mother
i
may
just
add
that
i
hear
it
is
considered
a
very
fine
painting
it
hangs
in
the
great
at
home
i
wish
i
were
as
good
as
he
has
made
it
look
the
next
morning
after
i
had
given
him
the
sitting
he
wanted
we
set
out
on
our
furniture
hunt
when
having
keen
enough
eyes
i
caught
sight
of
this
and
of
that
and
of
twenty
different
things
in
the
brokers
shops
we
did
not
agree
about
the
merits
of
everything
by
which
one
or
the
other
was
attracted
but
an
objection
by
the
one
always
turned
the
other
a
little
at
least
and
we
bought
nothing
we
were
not
agreed
about
yet
that
evening
the
hall
was
piled
with
things
sent
home
to
line
our
nest
percivale
as
i
have
said
had
saved
up
some
money
for
the
purpose
and
i
had
a
hundred
pounds
my
father
had
given
me
before
we
started
which
never
having
had
more
than
ten
of
my
own
at
a
time
i
was
eager
enough
to
spend
so
we
found
plenty
to
do
for
the
fortnight
during
which
time
my
mother
had
promised
to
say
nothing
to
her
friends
in
london
of
our
arrival
percivale
also
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
his
friends
everybody
thought
we
were
on
the
continent
or
somewhere
else
and
left
us
to
ourselves
and
as
he
had
sent
in
his
pictures
to
the
academy
he
was
able
to
take
a
rest
which
rest
consisted
in
working
hard
at
all
sorts
of
upholstery
not
to
mention
painters
and
carpenters
work
so
that
we
soon
got
the
little
house
made
into
a
very
warm
and
very
pretty
nest
i
may
mention
that
percivale
was
particularly
pleased
with
a
cabinet
i
bought
for
him
on
the
sly
to
stand
in
his
study
and
hold
his
paints
and
brushes
and
sketches
for
there
were
all
sorts
of
drawers
in
it
and
some
that
it
took
us
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
find
out
though
he
was
clever
enough
to
suspect
them
from
the
first
when
i
had
a
thought
of
such
a
thing
and
i
have
often
fancied
since
that
that
cabinet
was
just
like
himself
for
i
have
been
going
on
finding
out
things
in
him
that
i
had
no
idea
were
there
when
i
married
him
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
a
poet
for
instance
i
wonder
to
this
day
why
he
never
showed
me
any
of
his
verses
before
we
were
married
he
writes
better
poetry
than
my
father
at
least
my
father
says
so
indeed
i
soon
came
to
feel
very
ignorant
and
stupid
beside
him
he
could
tell
me
so
many
things
and
especially
in
art
for
he
had
thought
about
all
kinds
of
it
making
me
understand
that
there
is
no
end
to
it
any
more
than
to
the
nature
which
sets
it
going
and
that
the
more
we
see
into
nature
and
try
to
represent
it
the
more
ignorant
and
helpless
we
find
ourselves
until
at
length
i
began
to
wonder
whether
god
might
not
have
made
the
world
so
rich
and
full
just
to
teach
his
children
humility
for
a
while
i
felt
quite
stunned
he
very
much
wanted
me
to
draw
but
i
thought
it
was
no
use
trying
and
indeed
had
no
heart
for
it
i
spoke
to
my
father
about
it
he
said
it
was
indeed
of
no
use
if
my
object
was
to
be
able
to
think
much
of
myself
for
no
one
could
ever
succeed
in
that
in
the
long
run
but
if
my
object
was
to
reap
the
delight
of
the
truth
it
was
worth
while
to
spend
hours
and
hours
on
trying
to
draw
a
single
or
paint
the
wing
of
a
moth
chapter
iv
judy
visit
the
very
first
morning
after
the
expiry
of
the
fortnight
when
i
was
in
the
kitchen
with
sarah
giving
her
instructions
about
a
certain
dish
as
if
i
had
made
it
twenty
times
whereas
i
had
only
just
learned
how
from
a
shilling
there
came
a
double
knock
at
the
door
i
guessed
who
it
must
be
run
sarah
i
said
and
show
morley
into
the
when
i
entered
there
she
was
morley
cousin
judy
well
little
cozzie
she
cried
as
she
kissed
me
three
or
four
times
i
glad
to
see
you
gone
the
way
of
womankind
wooed
and
married
and
a
fate
child
inscrutable
fate
and
she
kissed
me
again
she
always
calls
me
little
coz
though
i
am
a
head
taller
than
herself
she
is
as
good
as
ever
quite
as
brusque
and
at
the
first
word
apparently
more
overbearing
but
she
is
as
ready
to
listen
to
reason
as
ever
was
woman
of
my
acquaintance
and
i
think
the
form
of
her
speech
is
but
a
somewhat
distorted
reflex
of
her
perfect
honesty
after
a
little
trifling
talk
which
is
sure
to
come
first
when
people
are
more
than
ordinarily
glad
to
meet
i
asked
after
her
children
i
forget
how
many
there
were
of
them
but
they
were
then
pretty
far
into
the
plural
number
growing
like
ill
weeds
she
said
as
anxious
as
ever
their
grandfathers
and
mothers
were
to
get
their
heads
up
and
do
mischief
for
my
part
i
wish
i
was
jove
to
start
them
full
grown
at
once
or
why
should
they
be
made
like
eve
out
of
their
father
ribs
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
their
mother
my
father
had
always
been
much
pleased
with
the
results
of
judy
training
as
contrasted
with
those
of
his
sister
the
little
ones
of
my
aunt
martha
family
were
always
wanting
something
and
always
looking
like
their
mother
while
she
was
always
reading
them
lectures
on
their
duty
and
never
making
them
mind
what
she
said
she
would
represent
the
thing
to
them
over
and
over
until
not
merely
all
force
but
all
sense
as
well
seemed
to
have
forsaken
it
her
notion
of
duty
was
to
tell
them
yet
again
the
duty
which
they
had
been
told
at
least
a
thousand
times
already
without
the
slightest
result
they
were
dull
children
wearisome
and
uninteresting
on
the
other
hand
the
little
morleys
were
full
of
life
and
eagerness
the
fault
in
them
was
that
they
would
take
petting
and
what
the
good
of
a
child
that
wo
be
petted
they
lacked
that
something
which
makes
a
woman
feel
motherly
when
did
you
arrive
cozzie
she
asked
a
fortnight
ago
yesterday
ah
you
sly
thing
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
the
time
furnishing
what
you
came
into
an
empty
house
not
quite
that
but
nearly
it
is
very
odd
i
should
never
have
seen
your
husband
we
have
crossed
each
other
twenty
times
not
so
odd
seeing
he
has
been
my
husband
only
a
fortnight
what
is
he
like
like
nothing
but
himself
is
he
tall
yes
is
he
stout
no
an
adonis
no
a
hercules
no
very
clever
i
believe
not
at
all
for
my
father
had
taught
me
to
look
down
on
that
word
why
did
you
marry
him
then
i
did
he
married
me
what
did
you
marry
him
for
then
for
love
what
did
you
love
him
for
because
he
was
a
philosopher
that
the
oddest
reason
i
ever
heard
for
marrying
a
man
i
said
for
loving
him
judy
her
bright
eyes
were
twinkling
with
fun
come
cozzie
she
said
give
me
a
proper
reason
for
falling
in
love
with
this
husband
of
yours
well
i
tell
you
then
i
said
only
you
must
tell
any
other
body
he
got
such
a
big
shaggy
head
just
like
a
lion
and
such
a
huge
big
foot
just
like
a
bear
yes
and
such
great
huge
hands
why
the
two
of
them
go
quite
round
my
waist
and
such
big
eyes
that
they
look
right
through
me
and
such
a
big
heart
that
if
he
saw
me
doing
any
thing
wrong
he
would
kill
me
and
bury
me
in
it
well
i
must
say
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
description
of
a
husband
i
ever
heard
it
sounds
to
me
very
like
an
ogre
yes
i
admit
the
description
is
rather
ogrish
but
then
he
poor
and
that
makes
up
for
a
good
deal
i
was
in
the
humor
for
talking
nonsense
and
of
course
expected
of
all
people
that
judy
would
understand
my
fun
how
does
that
make
up
for
any
thing
because
if
he
is
a
poor
man
he
is
a
rich
man
and
therefore
not
so
likely
to
be
a
stupid
how
do
you
make
that
out
because
first
of
all
the
rich
man
does
know
what
to
do
with
his
money
whereas
my
ogre
knows
what
to
do
without
it
then
the
rich
man
wonders
in
the
morning
which
waistcoat
he
shall
put
on
while
my
ogre
has
but
one
besides
his
sunday
one
then
supposing
the
rich
man
has
slept
well
and
has
done
a
fair
stroke
or
two
of
business
he
wants
nothing
but
a
wife
a
dinner
a
few
glasses
of
his
favorite
wine
and
the
evening
paper
with
a
sleep
in
his
easy
chair
to
be
perfectly
satisfied
that
this
world
is
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
now
my
ogre
on
the
other
hand
i
was
going
on
to
point
out
how
frightfully
different
from
all
this
my
ogre
was
how
he
would
devour
a
chop
and
drink
a
pint
of
ale
from
the
when
she
interrupted
me
saying
with
an
odd
expression
of
voice
you
are
satirical
cozzie
he
not
the
worst
sort
of
man
you
just
described
a
woman
might
be
very
happy
with
him
if
it
were
such
early
days
i
should
doubt
if
you
were
as
comfortable
as
you
would
have
people
think
for
how
else
should
you
be
so
it
flashed
upon
me
that
without
the
least
intention
i
had
been
giving
a
very
fair
portrait
of
morley
i
felt
my
face
grow
as
red
as
fire
i
had
no
intention
of
being
satirical
judy
i
replied
i
was
only
describing
a
man
the
very
opposite
of
my
husband
you
do
know
mine
yet
she
said
you
may
think
she
actually
broke
down
and
cried
i
had
never
in
my
life
seen
her
cry
and
i
was
miserable
at
what
i
had
done
here
was
a
nice
beginning
of
social
relations
in
my
married
life
i
knelt
down
put
my
arms
round
her
and
looked
up
in
her
face
dear
judy
i
said
you
mistake
me
quite
i
never
thought
of
morley
when
i
said
that
how
should
i
have
dared
to
say
such
things
if
i
had
he
is
a
most
kind
good
man
and
papa
and
every
one
is
glad
when
he
comes
to
see
us
i
dare
say
he
does
like
to
sleep
well
i
know
percivale
does
and
i
do
doubt
he
likes
to
get
on
with
what
he
at
percivale
does
for
he
ever
so
much
better
company
when
he
has
got
on
with
his
picture
and
i
know
he
likes
to
see
me
well
dressed
at
least
i
have
tried
him
with
any
thing
else
yet
for
i
have
plenty
of
clothes
for
a
while
and
then
for
the
dinner
which
i
believe
was
one
of
the
points
in
the
description
i
gave
i
wish
percivale
cared
a
little
more
for
his
for
then
it
would
be
easier
to
do
something
for
him
as
to
the
newspaper
there
i
fear
i
must
give
him
up
for
i
have
never
yet
seen
him
with
one
in
his
hand
he
stupid
about
some
things
oh
you
found
that
out
have
you
men
stupid
there
no
doubt
of
that
but
you
do
know
my
walter
yet
i
looked
up
and
behold
percivale
was
in
the
room
his
face
wore
such
a
curious
expression
that
i
could
hardly
help
laughing
and
no
wonder
for
here
was
i
on
my
knees
clasping
my
first
visitor
and
to
all
appearance
pouring
out
the
woes
of
my
wedded
life
in
her
lap
woes
so
deep
that
they
drew
tears
from
her
as
she
listened
all
this
flashed
upon
me
as
i
started
to
my
feet
but
i
could
give
no
explanation
i
could
only
make
haste
to
introduce
my
husband
to
my
cousin
judy
he
behaved
of
course
as
if
he
had
heard
nothing
but
i
fancy
judy
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
awkward
position
for
she
plunged
into
the
affair
at
once
here
is
my
cousin
percivale
has
been
abusing
my
husband
to
my
face
calling
him
rich
and
stupid
and
i
do
know
what
all
i
confess
he
is
so
stupid
as
to
be
very
fond
of
me
but
that
all
i
know
against
him
and
her
handkerchief
went
once
more
to
her
eyes
dear
judy
i
expostulated
you
know
i
did
say
one
word
about
him
of
course
i
do
you
silly
coz
she
cried
and
burst
out
laughing
but
i
wo
forgive
you
except
you
make
amends
by
dining
with
us
thus
for
the
time
she
carried
it
off
but
i
believe
and
have
since
had
good
reason
for
believing
that
she
had
really
mistaken
me
at
first
and
been
much
annoyed
she
and
percivale
got
on
very
well
he
showed
her
the
portrait
he
was
still
working
at
even
accepted
one
or
two
trifling
hints
as
to
the
likeness
and
they
parted
the
best
friends
in
the
world
glad
as
i
had
been
to
see
her
how
i
longed
to
see
the
last
of
her
the
moment
she
was
gone
i
threw
myself
into
his
arms
and
told
him
how
it
came
about
he
laughed
heartily
i
a
little
puzzled
he
said
to
hear
you
informing
a
lady
i
had
never
seen
that
i
was
so
very
stupid
but
i
was
telling
a
story
either
for
you
know
you
are
stupid
percivale
you
do
know
a
leg
from
a
shoulder
of
mutton
and
you
ca
carve
a
bit
how
ever
you
can
draw
as
you
do
is
a
marvel
to
me
when
you
know
nothing
about
the
shapes
of
things
it
was
very
wrong
to
say
it
even
for
the
sake
of
covering
poor
morley
husband
but
it
was
quite
true
you
know
perfectly
true
my
love
he
said
with
something
else
where
i
only
put
commas
and
i
mean
to
remain
so
in
order
that
you
may
always
have
something
to
fall
back
upon
when
you
get
yourself
into
a
scrape
by
forgetting
that
other
people
have
husbands
as
well
as
you
chapter
good
society
we
had
agreed
rather
against
the
inclination
of
both
of
us
to
dine
the
next
evening
with
the
morleys
we
should
have
preferred
our
own
society
but
we
could
not
refuse
they
will
be
talking
to
me
about
my
pictures
said
my
husband
and
that
is
just
what
i
hate
people
that
know
nothing
of
art
that
distinguish
purple
from
black
will
yet
parade
their
ignorance
and
expect
me
to
be
pleased
morley
is
a
man
percivale
i
said
that
the
worst
of
it
they
do
it
for
good
manners
i
know
the
kind
of
people
perfectly
i
hate
to
have
my
pictures
praised
it
is
as
bad
as
talking
to
one
face
about
the
nose
upon
it
i
wonder
if
all
ladies
keep
their
husbands
waiting
i
did
that
night
i
know
and
i
am
afraid
a
good
many
times
after
not
however
since
percivale
told
me
very
seriously
that
being
late
for
dinner
was
the
only
fault
of
mine
the
blame
of
which
he
would
not
take
on
his
own
shoulders
the
fact
on
this
occasion
was
that
i
could
not
get
my
hair
right
it
was
the
first
time
i
missed
what
i
had
been
used
to
and
longed
for
the
deft
fingers
of
my
mother
maid
to
help
me
when
i
told
him
the
cause
he
said
he
would
do
my
hair
for
me
next
time
if
i
would
teach
him
how
but
i
have
managed
very
well
since
without
either
him
or
a
when
we
reached
bolivar
square
we
found
the
company
waiting
and
as
if
for
a
rebuke
to
us
the
butler
announced
dinner
the
moment
we
entered
i
was
seated
between
morley
and
a
friend
of
his
who
took
me
down
baddeley
a
portly
gentleman
with
an
expanse
of
snowy
shirt
from
which
flashed
three
diamond
studs
a
huge
gold
chain
reposed
upon
his
front
and
on
his
finger
shone
a
brilliant
of
great
size
every
thing
about
him
seemed
to
say
look
how
real
i
am
no
shoddy
about
me
his
hands
were
plump
and
white
and
looked
as
if
they
did
not
know
what
dust
was
his
talk
sounded
very
rich
and
yet
there
was
no
pretence
in
it
his
wife
looked
less
of
a
lady
than
he
of
a
gentleman
for
she
betrayed
conscious
importance
i
found
afterwards
that
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
railway
contractor
who
had
himself
handled
the
spade
but
at
last
died
enormously
rich
he
spoke
blandly
but
with
a
certain
quiet
authority
which
i
disliked
are
you
fond
of
the
opera
mrs
percivale
he
asked
me
in
order
to
make
talk
i
have
never
been
to
the
opera
i
answered
never
been
to
the
opera
ai
you
fond
of
music
did
you
ever
know
a
lady
that
was
then
you
must
go
to
the
opera
but
it
is
just
because
i
fancy
myself
fond
of
music
that
i
do
think
i
should
like
the
opera
you
ca
hear
such
music
anywhere
else
but
the
antics
of
the
singers
pretending
to
be
in
such
furies
of
passion
yet
modulating
every
note
with
the
cunning
of
a
carver
in
ivory
seems
to
me
so
preposterous
for
surely
song
springs
from
a
brooding
over
past
feeling
i
do
not
mean
lost
feeling
never
from
present
emotion
ah
you
would
change
your
mind
after
having
once
been
i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
go
if
only
for
once
you
ought
now
really
an
artist
wife
must
do
without
such
expensive
amusements
except
her
husband
pictures
be
very
popular
indeed
i
might
as
well
cry
for
the
moon
the
cost
of
a
box
at
the
opera
for
a
single
night
would
keep
my
little
household
for
a
fortnight
ah
well
but
you
should
see
barber
he
said
perhaps
if
i
could
hear
without
seeing
i
should
like
it
better
i
answered
he
fell
silent
busying
himself
with
his
fish
and
when
he
spoke
again
turned
to
the
lady
on
his
left
i
went
on
with
my
dinner
i
knew
that
our
host
had
heard
what
i
said
for
i
saw
him
turn
rather
hastily
to
his
butler
morley
is
a
man
difficult
to
describe
stiff
in
the
back
and
long
and
loose
in
the
neck
reminding
me
of
those
that
bob
head
and
tail
up
and
down
alternately
when
he
agrees
with
any
thing
you
say
down
comes
his
head
with
a
rectangular
nod
when
he
does
not
agree
with
you
he
is
so
silent
and
motionless
that
he
leaves
you
in
doubt
whether
he
has
heard
a
word
of
what
you
have
been
saying
his
face
is
hard
and
was
to
me
then
inscrutable
while
what
he
said
always
seemed
to
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
what
he
was
thinking
and
i
had
not
then
learned
whether
he
had
a
heart
or
not
his
features
were
well
formed
but
they
and
his
head
and
face
too
small
for
his
body
he
seldom
smiled
except
when
in
doubt
he
had
i
understood
been
very
successful
in
business
and
always
looked
full
of
schemes
have
you
been
to
the
academy
yet
he
asked
no
this
is
only
the
first
day
of
it
are
your
husband
pictures
well
hung
as
high
as
haman
i
answered
skied
in
fact
that
is
the
right
word
i
believe
i
would
advise
you
to
avoid
slang
my
dear
cousin
slang
especially
and
to
remember
that
in
london
there
are
no
professions
after
six
o
clock
indeed
i
returned
as
we
came
along
in
the
carriage
cabbage
i
mean
i
saw
no
end
of
shops
open
i
mean
in
society
at
dinner
amongst
friends
you
know
my
dear
morley
you
have
just
done
asking
me
about
my
pictures
and
if
you
will
listen
a
moment
you
will
hear
that
lady
next
my
husband
talking
to
him
about
leslie
and
turner
and
i
do
know
who
more
all
in
the
trade
hush
hush
i
beg
he
almost
whispered
looking
agonized
that
baddeley
her
husband
next
to
you
is
a
great
that
why
i
asked
him
to
meet
you
i
thought
there
were
no
professions
in
london
after
six
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
made
my
meaning
quite
clear
to
you
not
quite
yet
i
think
i
understand
you
we
have
a
talk
about
it
another
time
with
pleasure
it
irritated
me
rather
that
he
should
talk
to
me
a
married
woman
as
to
a
little
girl
who
did
not
know
how
to
behave
herself
but
his
patronage
of
my
husband
displeased
me
far
more
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
committing
the
terrible
blunder
of
asking
baddeley
if
he
had
any
poor
relations
but
i
checked
myself
in
time
and
prayed
to
know
whether
he
was
a
member
of
parliament
he
answered
that
he
was
not
in
the
house
at
present
and
asked
in
return
why
i
had
wished
to
know
i
answered
that
i
wanted
a
bill
brought
in
for
the
punishment
of
fraudulent
milkmen
for
i
could
get
a
decent
pennyworth
of
milk
in
all
camden
town
he
laughed
and
said
it
would
be
a
very
desirable
measure
only
too
great
an
interference
with
the
liberty
of
the
subject
i
told
him
that
kind
of
liberty
was
just
what
law
in
general
owed
its
existence
to
and
was
there
on
purpose
to
interfere
with
but
he
did
not
seem
to
see
it
the
fact
is
i
was
very
silly
proud
of
being
the
wife
of
an
artist
i
resented
the
social
injustice
which
i
thought
gave
artists
no
place
but
one
of
sufferance
proud
also
of
being
poor
for
percivale
sake
i
made
a
show
of
my
poverty
before
people
whom
i
supposed
rightly
enough
in
many
cases
to
be
proud
of
their
riches
but
i
knew
nothing
of
what
poverty
really
meant
and
was
as
yet
only
playing
at
being
poor
cherishing
a
foolish
though
unacknowledged
notion
of
protecting
my
husband
poverty
with
the
ægis
of
my
position
as
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
consequence
in
his
county
i
was
thus
wronging
the
dignity
of
my
husband
position
and
complimenting
wealth
by
making
so
much
of
its
absence
poverty
or
wealth
ought
to
have
been
in
my
eyes
such
a
trifle
that
i
never
thought
of
publishing
whether
i
was
rich
or
poor
i
ought
to
have
taken
my
position
without
wasting
a
thought
on
what
it
might
appear
in
the
eyes
of
those
about
me
meeting
them
on
the
mere
level
of
humanity
and
leaving
them
to
settle
with
themselves
how
they
were
to
think
of
me
and
where
they
were
to
place
me
i
suspect
also
now
that
i
think
of
it
that
i
looked
down
upon
my
cousin
judy
because
she
had
a
mere
man
of
business
for
her
husband
forgetting
that
our
lord
had
found
a
collector
of
conquered
taxes
a
man
i
presume
with
little
enough
of
the
artistic
about
him
one
of
the
fittest
in
his
nation
to
bear
the
message
of
his
redemption
to
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
it
is
his
loves
and
his
hopes
not
his
visions
and
intentions
by
which
a
man
is
to
be
judged
my
father
had
taught
me
all
this
but
i
did
not
understand
it
then
nor
until
years
after
i
had
left
him
is
percivale
a
lady
of
fortune
asked
baddeley
of
my
cousin
judy
when
we
were
gone
for
we
were
the
first
to
leave
certainly
not
why
do
you
ask
she
returned
because
from
her
talk
i
thought
she
must
be
he
answered
cousin
judy
told
me
this
the
next
day
and
i
could
see
she
thought
i
had
been
bragging
of
my
family
so
i
recounted
all
the
conversation
i
had
had
with
him
as
nearly
as
i
could
recollect
and
set
down
the
question
to
an
impertinent
irony
but
i
have
since
changed
my
mind
i
now
judge
that
he
could
not
believe
any
poor
person
would
joke
about
poverty
i
never
found
one
of
those
people
who
go
about
begging
for
charities
believe
me
when
i
told
him
the
simple
truth
that
i
could
not
afford
to
subscribe
none
but
a
rich
person
they
seem
to
think
would
dare
such
an
excuse
and
that
only
in
the
just
expectation
that
its
very
assertion
must
render
it
incredible
chapter
vi
a
refuge
from
the
heat
there
was
a
little
garden
one
side
enclosed
by
the
house
another
by
the
studio
and
the
remaining
two
by
walls
evidently
built
for
the
nightly
convenience
of
promenading
cats
there
was
one
in
the
which
occupied
the
centre
and
a
few
small
which
i
may
now
safely
say
never
bore
any
thing
upon
the
walls
but
the
last
occupant
had
cared
for
his
garden
and
when
i
came
to
the
cottage
it
was
although
you
would
hardly
believe
it
now
that
my
garden
is
inside
the
house
a
pretty
little
spot
only
if
you
stop
thinking
about
a
garden
it
begins
at
once
to
go
to
the
bad
used
although
i
had
been
to
great
wide
lawns
and
park
and
gardens
and
wilderness
the
tiny
enclosure
soon
became
to
me
the
type
of
the
boundless
universe
the
streets
roared
about
me
with
ugly
omnibuses
and
uglier
cabs
fine
carriages
huge
drays
and
worse
far
with
the
cries
of
all
the
tribe
of
costermongers
one
especially
offensive
which
soon
began
to
haunt
me
i
almost
hated
the
man
who
sent
it
forth
to
fill
the
summer
air
with
disgust
he
always
but
his
hollowed
hand
to
his
jaw
as
if
it
were
loose
and
he
had
to
hold
it
in
its
place
before
he
uttered
his
hideous
howl
which
would
send
me
hurrying
up
the
stairs
to
bury
my
head
under
all
the
pillows
of
my
bed
until
coming
back
across
the
wilderness
of
streets
and
lanes
like
the
cry
of
a
jackal
growing
fainter
and
fainter
upon
the
wind
it
should
pass
and
die
away
in
the
distance
suburban
london
i
say
was
roaring
about
me
and
i
was
confined
to
a
few
square
yards
of
grass
and
and
but
above
was
the
depth
of
the
sky
and
thence
at
night
the
hosts
of
heaven
looked
in
upon
me
with
the
same
calm
assured
glance
with
which
they
shone
upon
southern
forests
swarming
with
great
butterflies
and
creatures
that
go
flaming
through
the
tropic
darkness
and
there
the
moon
would
come
and
cast
her
lovely
shadows
and
there
was
room
enough
to
feel
alone
and
to
try
to
pray
and
what
was
strange
the
room
seemed
greater
though
the
loneliness
was
gone
when
my
husband
walked
up
and
down
in
it
with
me
true
the
greater
part
of
the
walk
seemed
to
be
the
turnings
for
they
always
came
just
when
you
wanted
to
go
on
and
on
but
even
with
the
scope
of
the
world
for
your
walk
you
must
turn
and
come
back
some
time
at
first
when
he
was
smoking
his
great
brown
meerschaum
he
and
i
would
walk
in
opposite
directions
passing
each
other
in
the
middle
and
so
make
the
space
double
the
size
for
he
had
all
the
garden
to
himself
and
i
had
it
all
to
myself
and
so
i
had
his
garden
and
mine
too
that
is
how
by
degrees
i
got
able
to
bear
the
smoke
of
tobacco
for
i
had
never
been
used
to
it
and
found
it
a
small
trial
at
first
but
now
i
have
got
actually
to
like
it
and
greet
a
stray
whiff
from
the
study
like
a
message
from
my
husband
i
fancy
i
could
tell
the
smoke
of
that
old
black
and
red
meerschaum
from
the
smoke
of
any
other
pipe
in
creation
you
cure
him
of
that
bad
habit
said
cousin
judy
to
me
once
it
made
me
angry
what
right
had
she
to
call
any
thing
my
husband
did
a
bad
habit
and
to
expect
me
to
agree
with
her
was
ten
times
worse
i
am
saving
my
money
now
to
buy
him
a
grand
new
pipe
and
i
may
just
mention
here
that
once
i
spent
ninepence
out
of
my
last
shilling
to
get
him
a
packet
of
bristol
for
he
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
smoking
altogether
because
of
well
because
of
what
will
appear
by
and
by
england
is
getting
dreadfully
crowded
with
mean
ugly
houses
if
they
were
those
of
the
poor
and
struggling
and
not
of
the
rich
and
comfortable
one
might
be
consoled
but
rich
barbarism
in
the
shape
of
ugliness
is
again
pushing
us
to
the
sea
there
however
its
control
stops
and
since
i
lived
in
london
the
sea
has
grown
more
precious
to
me
than
it
was
even
in
those
lovely
days
at
kilkhaven
merely
because
no
one
can
build
upon
it
ocean
and
sky
remain
as
god
made
them
he
must
love
space
for
us
though
it
be
needless
for
himself
seeing
that
in
all
the
magnificent
notions
of
creation
afforded
us
by
astronomers
shoal
upon
shoal
of
suns
each
the
centre
of
complicated
and
infinitely
varied
systems
the
spaces
between
are
yet
more
overwhelming
in
their
vast
inconceivableness
i
thank
god
for
the
room
he
thus
gives
us
and
hence
can
endure
to
see
the
fair
face
of
his
england
disfigured
by
the
of
his
children
there
was
in
the
garden
a
little
of
which
i
was
fond
chiefly
because
knowing
my
passion
for
the
flower
percivale
had
surrounded
it
with
a
multitude
of
sweet
peas
which
as
they
grew
he
had
trained
over
the
of
its
sides
through
them
filtered
the
sweet
airs
of
the
summer
as
through
an
æolian
harp
of
unheard
harmonies
to
sit
there
in
a
warm
evening
when
the
just
woke
and
gave
two
or
three
wafts
of
their
wings
and
ceased
was
like
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
small
gospel
the
summer
had
come
on
and
the
days
were
very
hot
so
hot
and
changeless
with
their
unclouded
skies
and
their
glowing
centre
that
they
seemed
to
grow
stupid
with
their
own
heat
it
was
as
if
like
a
hen
brooding
over
her
chickens
the
day
brooding
over
its
coming
harvests
grew
dull
and
sleepy
living
only
in
what
was
to
come
notwithstanding
the
feelings
i
have
just
recorded
i
began
to
long
for
a
wider
horizon
whence
some
wind
might
come
and
blow
upon
me
and
wake
me
up
not
merely
to
live
but
to
know
that
i
lived
one
afternoon
i
left
my
little
where
i
had
been
sitting
at
work
and
went
through
the
house
and
down
the
precipice
into
my
study
it
is
so
hot
i
said
i
will
try
my
little
grotto
it
may
be
cooler
he
opened
the
door
for
me
and
with
his
palette
on
his
thumb
and
a
brush
in
his
hand
sat
down
for
a
moment
beside
me
this
heat
is
too
much
for
you
darling
he
said
i
do
feel
it
i
wish
i
could
get
from
the
garden
into
my
nest
without
going
up
through
the
house
and
down
the
jacob
ladder
i
said
it
is
so
hot
i
never
felt
heat
like
it
before
he
sat
silent
for
a
while
and
then
said
i
been
thinking
i
must
get
you
into
the
country
for
a
few
weeks
it
would
do
you
no
end
of
good
i
suppose
the
wind
does
blow
somewhere
i
returned
but
you
do
want
to
leave
me
he
said
i
do
and
i
know
with
that
ugly
portrait
on
hand
you
ca
go
with
me
he
happened
to
be
painting
the
portrait
of
a
plain
lady
in
a
delicate
lace
cap
a
very
unfit
subject
for
art
much
needing
to
be
made
over
again
first
it
seemed
to
me
only
there
she
was
with
a
right
to
have
her
portrait
painted
if
she
wished
it
and
there
was
percivale
with
time
on
his
hands
and
room
in
his
pockets
and
the
faith
that
whatever
god
had
thought
worth
making
could
not
be
unworthy
of
representation
hence
he
had
willingly
undertaken
a
likeness
of
her
to
be
finished
within
a
certain
time
and
was
now
working
at
it
as
conscientiously
as
if
it
had
been
the
portrait
of
a
lovely
young
duchess
or
i
was
only
afraid
he
would
make
it
too
like
to
please
the
lady
herself
his
time
was
now
getting
short
and
he
could
not
leave
home
before
fulfilling
his
engagement
but
he
returned
why
should
you
go
to
the
hall
for
a
week
or
two
without
me
i
will
take
you
down
and
come
and
fetch
you
i
so
stupid
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
i
said
i
did
not
in
the
least
believe
it
and
yet
was
on
the
edge
of
crying
which
is
not
a
habit
with
me
you
know
better
than
that
my
wynnie
he
answered
gravely
you
want
your
mother
to
comfort
you
and
there
must
be
some
air
in
the
country
so
tell
sarah
to
put
up
your
things
and
i
take
you
down
morning
when
i
get
this
portrait
done
i
will
come
and
stay
a
few
days
if
they
will
have
me
and
then
take
you
home
the
thought
of
seeing
my
mother
and
my
father
and
the
old
place
came
over
me
with
a
rush
i
felt
all
at
once
as
if
i
had
been
absent
for
years
instead
of
weeks
i
cried
in
earnest
now
with
delight
though
and
there
is
no
shame
in
that
so
it
was
all
arranged
and
next
afternoon
i
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
the
yellow
with
my
mother
seated
beside
me
and
connie
in
an
by
the
open
window
through
which
came
every
now
and
then
such
a
sweet
wave
of
air
as
bathed
me
with
hope
and
seemed
to
wash
all
the
noises
even
the
man
hateful
howl
from
my
brain
yet
glad
as
i
was
to
be
once
more
at
home
i
felt
when
percivale
left
me
the
next
morning
to
return
by
a
train
to
his
ugly
portrait
for
the
lady
was
to
sit
to
him
that
same
afternoon
that
the
idea
of
home
was
already
leaving
oldcastle
hall
and
flitting
back
to
the
suburban
cottage
haunted
by
the
bawling
voice
of
the
costermonger
but
i
soon
felt
better
for
here
there
was
plenty
of
shadow
and
in
the
hottest
days
my
father
could
always
tell
where
any
wind
would
be
stirring
for
he
knew
every
out
and
in
of
the
place
like
his
own
pockets
as
dora
said
who
took
a
little
after
cousin
judy
in
her
way
it
will
give
a
notion
of
his
tenderness
if
i
set
down
just
one
tiniest
instance
of
his
attention
to
me
the
forenoon
was
oppressive
i
was
sitting
under
a
tree
trying
to
read
when
he
came
up
to
me
there
was
a
wooden
gate
with
open
bars
near
he
went
and
set
it
wide
saying
there
my
love
you
will
fancy
yourself
cooler
if
i
leave
the
gate
open
will
my
reader
laugh
at
me
for
mentioning
such
a
trifle
i
think
not
for
it
went
deep
to
my
heart
and
i
seemed
to
know
god
better
for
it
ever
after
a
father
is
a
great
and
marvellous
truth
and
one
you
can
never
get
at
the
depth
of
try
how
you
may
then
my
mother
she
was
if
possible
yet
more
to
me
than
my
father
i
could
tell
her
any
thing
and
every
thing
without
fear
while
i
confess
to
a
little
dread
of
my
father
still
he
is
too
like
my
own
conscience
to
allow
of
my
being
quite
confident
with
him
but
connie
is
just
as
comfortable
with
him
as
i
am
with
my
mother
if
in
my
childhood
i
was
ever
tempted
to
conceal
any
thing
from
her
the
very
thought
of
it
made
me
miserable
until
i
had
told
her
and
now
she
would
watch
me
with
her
gentle
eyes
and
seemed
to
know
at
once
without
being
told
what
was
the
matter
with
me
she
never
asked
me
what
i
should
like
but
went
and
brought
something
and
if
she
saw
that
i
did
care
for
it
would
press
me
or
offer
any
thing
instead
but
chat
for
a
minute
or
two
carry
it
away
and
return
with
something
else
my
heart
was
like
to
break
at
times
with
the
swelling
of
the
love
that
was
in
it
my
eldest
child
my
ethelwyn
for
my
husband
would
have
her
called
the
same
name
as
me
only
i
insisted
it
should
be
after
my
mother
and
not
after
me
has
her
very
eyes
and
for
years
has
been
trying
to
mother
me
over
again
to
the
best
of
her
sweet
ability
chapter
vii
connie
it
is
high
time
though
that
i
dropped
writing
about
myself
for
a
while
i
do
find
my
self
so
interesting
as
it
used
to
be
the
worst
of
some
kinds
especially
of
small
illnesses
is
that
they
make
you
think
a
great
deal
too
much
about
yourself
connie
which
was
a
great
and
terrible
one
never
made
her
do
so
she
was
always
forgetting
herself
in
her
interest
about
others
i
think
i
was
made
more
selfish
to
begin
with
and
yet
i
have
a
hope
that
a
about
yourself
may
not
be
pure
selfishness
it
may
be
something
else
wrong
in
you
that
makes
you
uncomfortable
and
keeps
drawing
your
eyes
towards
the
aching
place
i
will
hope
so
till
i
get
rid
of
the
whole
business
and
then
i
shall
not
care
much
how
it
came
or
what
it
was
connie
was
now
a
thin
pale
not
handsome
but
lovely
girl
her
eyes
some
people
said
were
too
big
for
her
face
but
that
seemed
to
me
no
more
to
the
discredit
of
her
beauty
than
it
would
have
been
a
reproach
to
say
that
her
soul
was
too
big
for
her
body
she
had
been
early
ripened
by
the
hot
sun
of
suffering
and
the
which
pain
had
taught
her
patience
had
mossed
her
over
and
made
her
warm
and
soft
and
sweet
she
never
looked
for
attention
but
accepted
all
that
was
offered
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
it
is
more
than
i
need
but
you
are
so
good
i
must
spoil
it
she
was
not
confined
to
her
sofa
now
though
she
needed
to
lie
down
often
but
could
walk
about
pretty
well
only
you
must
give
her
time
you
could
always
make
her
merry
by
saying
she
walked
like
an
old
woman
and
it
was
the
only
way
we
could
get
rid
of
the
sadness
of
seeing
it
we
betook
ourselves
to
her
to
laugh
sadness
away
from
us
once
as
i
lay
on
a
couch
on
the
lawn
she
came
towards
me
carrying
a
bunch
of
grapes
from
the
greenhouse
a
great
bunch
each
individual
grape
ready
to
burst
with
the
sunlight
it
had
bottled
up
in
its
swollen
purple
skin
they
are
too
heavy
for
you
old
lady
i
cried
yes
i
an
old
lady
she
answered
think
what
good
use
of
my
time
i
have
made
compared
with
you
i
have
got
ever
so
far
before
you
i
nearly
forgotten
how
to
walk
the
tears
gathered
in
my
eyes
as
she
left
me
with
the
bunch
for
how
could
one
help
being
sad
to
think
of
the
time
when
she
used
to
bound
like
a
fawn
over
the
grass
her
slender
figure
borne
like
a
feather
on
its
own
slight
yet
firm
muscles
which
used
to
knot
so
much
harder
than
any
of
ours
she
turned
to
say
something
and
perceiving
my
emotion
came
slowly
back
dear
wynnie
she
said
you
would
have
me
back
with
my
old
foolishness
would
you
believe
me
life
is
ten
times
more
precious
than
it
was
before
i
feel
and
enjoy
and
love
so
much
more
i
do
know
how
often
i
thank
god
for
what
befell
me
i
could
only
smile
an
answer
unable
to
speak
not
now
from
pity
but
from
shame
of
my
own
petulant
restlessness
and
impatient
helplessness
i
believe
she
had
a
special
affection
for
poor
sprite
the
pony
which
threw
her
special
i
mean
since
the
accident
regarding
him
as
in
some
sense
the
angel
which
had
driven
her
out
of
paradise
into
a
better
world
if
ever
he
got
loose
and
connie
was
anywhere
about
he
was
sure
to
find
her
he
was
an
omnivorous
animal
and
she
had
always
something
he
would
eat
when
his
favorite
apples
were
unattainable
more
than
once
she
had
been
roused
from
her
sleep
on
the
lawn
by
the
lips
and
the
breath
of
sprite
upon
her
face
but
although
one
painful
sign
of
her
weakness
was
that
she
started
at
the
least
noise
or
sudden
discovery
of
a
presence
she
never
started
at
the
most
unexpected
intrusion
of
sprite
any
more
than
at
the
voice
of
my
father
or
mother
need
i
say
there
was
one
more
whose
voice
or
presence
never
startled
her
the
relation
between
them
was
lovely
to
see
turner
was
a
fine
healthy
fellow
of
bold
carriage
and
frank
manners
above
the
middle
height
with
rather
large
features
keen
black
eyes
and
great
personal
strength
yet
to
such
a
man
poor
little
connie
assumed
imperious
airs
mostly
but
perhaps
not
entirely
for
the
fun
of
it
while
he
looked
only
enchanted
every
time
she
honored
him
with
a
little
tyranny
there
i
tired
she
would
say
holding
out
her
arms
like
a
baby
carry
me
in
and
the
great
strong
man
would
stoop
with
a
worshipping
look
in
his
eyes
and
taking
her
carefully
would
carry
her
in
as
lightly
and
gently
and
steadily
as
if
she
had
been
but
the
baby
whose
manners
she
had
for
the
moment
assumed
this
began
of
course
when
she
was
unable
to
walk
but
it
did
not
stop
then
for
she
would
occasionally
tell
him
to
carry
her
after
she
was
quite
capable
of
crawling
at
least
they
had
now
been
engaged
for
some
months
and
before
me
as
a
woman
they
did
not
mind
talking
a
little
one
day
she
was
lying
on
a
rug
on
the
lawn
with
him
on
the
grass
beside
her
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
looking
down
into
her
eyes
she
lifted
her
hand
and
stroked
his
mustache
with
a
forefinger
while
he
kept
as
still
as
a
statue
or
one
who
fears
to
scare
the
bird
that
is
picking
up
the
crumbs
at
his
feet
poor
poor
man
she
said
and
from
the
tone
i
knew
the
tears
had
begun
to
gather
in
those
eyes
why
do
you
pity
me
connie
he
asked
because
you
will
have
such
a
wretched
little
creature
for
a
wife
some
day
or
perhaps
never
which
would
be
best
after
all
he
answered
cheerily
if
you
will
kindly
allow
me
my
choice
i
prefer
just
a
wretched
little
creature
to
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
why
pray
give
a
good
reason
and
i
will
forgive
your
bad
taste
because
she
wo
be
able
to
hurt
me
much
when
she
beats
me
a
better
reason
or
she
will
because
i
can
punish
her
if
she
is
good
by
taking
her
up
in
my
arms
and
carrying
her
about
until
she
gives
in
a
better
reason
or
i
shall
be
naughty
directly
because
i
shall
always
know
where
to
find
her
ah
yes
she
must
leave
to
find
but
that
a
silly
reason
if
you
do
give
me
a
better
i
get
up
and
walk
into
the
house
because
there
wo
be
any
waste
of
me
will
that
do
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
with
mock
imperiousness
i
mean
that
i
shall
be
able
to
lay
not
only
my
heart
but
my
brute
strength
at
her
feet
i
shall
be
allowed
to
be
her
beast
of
burden
to
carry
her
whither
she
would
and
so
with
my
body
her
to
worship
more
than
most
husbands
have
a
chance
of
worshipping
their
wives
there
take
me
take
me
she
said
stretching
up
her
arms
to
him
how
good
you
are
i
do
deserve
such
a
great
man
one
bit
but
i
love
him
take
me
directly
for
there
wynnie
listening
to
every
word
we
say
to
each
other
and
laughing
at
us
she
can
laugh
without
looking
like
it
the
fact
is
i
was
crying
and
the
creature
knew
it
turner
brought
her
to
me
and
held
her
down
for
me
to
kiss
then
carried
her
in
to
her
mother
i
believe
the
county
people
round
considered
our
family
far
gone
on
the
inclined
plane
of
degeneracy
first
my
mother
the
heiress
had
married
a
clergyman
of
no
high
family
then
they
had
given
their
eldest
daughter
to
a
poor
artist
something
of
the
same
standing
as
well
i
will
be
rude
to
no
order
of
humanity
and
therefore
avoid
comparisons
and
now
it
was
generally
known
that
connie
was
engaged
to
a
country
practitioner
a
man
who
made
up
his
own
prescriptions
we
talked
and
laughed
over
certain
remarks
of
the
kind
that
reached
us
and
compared
our
two
with
the
gentlemen
about
us
in
no
way
to
the
advantage
of
any
of
the
latter
you
may
be
sure
it
was
silly
work
but
we
were
only
two
loving
girls
with
the
best
possible
reasons
for
being
proud
of
the
men
who
had
honored
us
with
their
love
chapter
viii
connie
baby
it
is
time
i
told
my
readers
something
about
the
little
theodora
she
was
now
nearly
four
years
old
i
think
a
wild
little
creature
very
pretty
at
least
most
people
said
so
while
others
insisted
that
she
had
a
common
look
i
admit
she
was
not
like
a
child
only
one
has
seen
ladies
children
look
common
enough
neither
did
she
look
like
the
child
of
working
people
though
amongst
such
again
one
sees
sometimes
a
child
the
oldest
family
in
england
might
be
proud
of
the
fact
is
she
had
a
certain
tinge
of
the
savage
about
her
specially
manifest
in
a
certain
furtive
look
of
her
black
eyes
with
which
she
seemed
now
and
then
to
be
measuring
you
and
her
prospects
in
relation
to
you
i
have
seen
the
child
of
cultivated
parents
sit
and
stare
at
a
stranger
from
her
stool
in
the
most
persistent
manner
never
withdrawing
her
eyes
as
if
she
would
pierce
to
his
soul
and
understand
by
very
force
of
insight
whether
he
was
or
was
not
one
to
be
honored
with
her
confidence
and
i
have
often
seen
the
glance
of
sly
merriment
or
loving
shyness
or
small
coquetry
but
i
have
never
in
any
other
child
seen
look
of
speculation
and
it
used
to
make
me
uneasy
for
of
course
like
every
one
else
in
the
house
i
loved
the
child
she
was
a
wayward
often
unmanageable
creature
but
affectionate
sometimes
after
an
insane
or
at
least
very
fashion
every
now
and
then
she
would
take
an
unaccountable
preference
for
some
one
of
the
family
or
household
at
one
time
for
the
old
housekeeper
at
another
for
the
at
another
for
one
of
us
in
which
fits
of
partiality
she
would
always
turn
a
blind
and
deaf
side
upon
every
one
else
actually
seeming
to
imagine
she
showed
the
strength
of
her
love
to
the
one
by
the
paraded
exclusion
of
the
others
i
can
not
tell
how
much
of
this
was
natural
to
her
and
how
much
the
result
of
the
foolish
and
injurious
jealousy
of
the
servants
i
say
because
i
know
such
an
influencing
was
all
but
impossible
in
the
family
itself
if
my
father
heard
any
one
utter
such
a
phrase
as
you
love
me
best
or
better
than
such
a
one
or
ai
i
your
favorite
well
you
all
know
my
father
and
know
him
really
for
he
never
wrote
a
word
he
did
not
believe
but
you
would
have
been
astonished
i
venture
to
think
and
perhaps
at
first
bewildered
as
well
by
the
look
of
indignation
flashed
from
his
eyes
he
was
not
the
gentle
man
some
readers
i
know
fancy
him
from
his
writings
he
was
gentle
even
to
tenderness
when
he
had
time
to
think
a
moment
and
in
any
quiet
judgment
he
always
took
as
much
the
side
of
the
offender
as
was
possible
with
any
likelihood
of
justice
but
in
the
first
moments
of
contact
with
what
he
thought
bad
in
principle
and
that
in
the
smallest
trifle
he
would
speak
words
that
made
even
those
who
were
not
included
in
the
condemnation
tremble
with
sympathetic
fear
there
harry
you
take
it
quick
or
charley
will
have
it
said
the
nurse
one
day
little
thinking
who
overheard
her
woman
cried
a
voice
of
wrath
from
the
corridor
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
would
you
make
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell
than
yourself
an
hour
after
she
was
sent
for
to
the
study
and
when
she
came
out
her
eyes
were
very
red
my
father
was
unusually
silent
at
dinner
and
after
the
younger
ones
were
gone
he
turned
to
my
mother
and
said
ethel
i
spoke
the
truth
all
is
of
the
devil
horribly
bad
and
yet
i
am
more
to
blame
in
my
condemnation
of
them
than
she
for
the
words
themselves
the
thought
of
so
polluting
the
mind
of
a
child
makes
me
fierce
and
the
wrath
of
man
worketh
not
the
righteousness
of
god
the
old
adam
is
only
too
glad
to
get
a
word
in
if
even
in
behalf
of
his
supplanting
successor
then
he
rose
and
taking
my
mother
by
the
arm
walked
away
with
her
i
confess
i
honored
him
for
his
the
most
i
must
add
that
the
offending
nurse
had
been
ten
years
in
the
family
and
ought
to
have
known
better
but
to
return
to
theodora
she
was
subject
to
attacks
of
the
most
furious
passion
especially
when
any
thing
occurred
to
thwart
the
indulgence
of
the
ephemeral
partiality
i
have
just
described
then
wherever
she
was
she
would
throw
herself
down
at
once
on
the
floor
on
the
walk
or
lawn
or
as
happened
on
one
occasion
in
the
water
and
kick
and
scream
at
such
times
she
cared
nothing
even
for
my
father
of
whom
generally
she
stood
in
considerable
awe
a
feeling
he
rather
encouraged
she
has
plenty
of
people
about
her
to
represent
the
gospel
he
said
once
i
will
keep
the
department
of
the
law
without
which
she
will
never
appreciate
the
gospel
my
part
will
i
trust
vanish
in
due
time
and
the
law
turn
out
to
have
been
after
all
only
the
imperfect
gospel
just
as
the
leaf
is
the
imperfect
flower
but
the
gospel
is
no
gospel
till
it
gets
into
the
heart
and
it
sometimes
wants
a
torpedo
to
blow
the
gates
of
that
open
for
no
torpedo
or
krupp
gun
however
did
theodora
care
at
such
times
and
after
repeated
experience
of
the
inefficacy
of
coaxing
my
father
gave
orders
that
when
a
fit
occurred
every
one
without
exception
should
not
merely
leave
her
alone
but
go
out
of
sight
and
if
possible
out
of
hearing
at
least
out
of
her
hearing
that
she
might
know
she
had
driven
her
friends
far
from
her
and
be
brought
to
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
need
i
am
pretty
sure
that
if
she
had
been
one
of
us
that
is
one
of
his
own
he
would
have
taken
sharper
measures
with
her
but
he
said
we
must
never
attempt
to
treat
other
people
children
as
our
own
for
they
are
not
our
own
we
did
not
love
them
enough
he
said
to
make
severity
safe
either
for
them
or
for
us
the
plan
worked
so
far
well
that
after
a
time
varied
in
length
according
to
causes
inscrutable
she
would
always
smiling
but
as
to
any
conscience
of
wrong
she
seemed
to
have
no
more
than
nature
herself
who
looks
out
with
smiling
face
after
hours
of
thunder
lightning
and
rain
and
although
this
treatment
brought
her
out
of
them
sooner
the
fits
themselves
came
quite
as
frequently
as
before
but
she
had
another
habit
more
alarming
and
more
troublesome
as
well
she
would
not
unfrequently
vanish
and
have
to
be
long
sought
for
in
such
case
she
never
reappeared
of
herself
what
made
it
so
alarming
was
that
there
were
dangerous
places
about
our
house
but
she
would
generally
be
found
seated
perfectly
quiet
in
some
nook
where
she
had
never
been
before
playing
not
with
any
of
her
toys
but
with
something
she
had
picked
up
and
appropriated
finding
in
it
some
shadowy
amusement
which
no
one
understood
but
herself
she
was
very
fond
of
bright
colors
especially
in
dress
and
if
she
found
a
brilliant
or
gorgeous
fragment
of
any
substance
would
be
sure
to
hide
it
away
in
some
hole
or
corner
perhaps
known
only
to
herself
her
love
of
approbation
was
strong
and
her
affection
demonstrative
but
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
speak
the
truth
in
a
word
she
must
we
thought
have
come
of
wild
parentage
so
many
of
her
ways
were
like
those
of
a
forest
animal
in
our
design
of
training
her
for
a
maid
to
connie
we
seemed
already
likely
enough
to
be
frustrated
at
all
events
there
was
nothing
to
encourage
the
attempt
seeing
she
had
some
sort
of
aversion
to
connie
amounting
almost
to
dread
we
could
rarely
persuade
her
to
go
near
her
perhaps
it
was
a
dislike
to
her
helplessness
some
vague
impression
that
her
lying
all
day
on
the
sofa
indicated
an
unnatural
condition
of
being
with
which
she
could
have
no
sympathy
those
of
us
who
had
the
highest
spirits
the
greatest
exuberance
of
animal
life
were
evidently
those
whose
society
was
most
attractive
to
her
connie
tried
all
she
could
to
conquer
her
dislike
and
entice
the
wayward
thing
to
her
heart
but
nothing
would
do
sometimes
she
would
seem
to
soften
for
a
moment
but
all
at
once
with
a
wriggle
and
a
backward
spasm
in
the
arms
of
the
person
who
carried
her
she
would
manifest
such
a
fresh
access
of
repulsion
that
for
fear
of
an
outburst
of
fierce
and
objurgatory
wailing
which
might
upset
poor
connie
altogether
she
would
be
borne
off
hurriedly
sometimes
i
confess
rather
ungently
as
well
i
have
seen
connie
cry
because
of
the
child
treatment
of
her
you
could
not
interest
her
so
much
in
any
story
but
that
if
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
the
flutter
of
a
bird
reached
eye
or
ear
away
she
would
dart
on
the
instant
leaving
the
discomfited
narrator
in
lonely
disgrace
external
nature
and
almost
nothing
else
had
free
access
to
her
mind
at
the
suddenest
sight
or
sound
she
was
alive
on
the
instant
she
was
a
most
amusing
and
sometimes
almost
bewitching
little
companion
but
the
delight
in
her
would
be
not
unfrequently
quenched
by
some
altogether
unforeseen
outbreak
of
heartless
petulance
or
turbulent
rebellion
indeed
her
resistance
to
authority
grew
as
she
grew
older
and
occasioned
my
father
and
mother
and
indeed
all
of
us
no
little
anxiety
even
charley
and
harry
would
stand
with
open
mouths
contemplating
aghast
the
atrocity
of
resistance
to
the
will
of
the
unquestioned
authorities
it
was
what
they
could
not
understand
being
to
them
an
impossibility
such
resistance
was
almost
always
accompanied
by
storm
and
tempest
and
the
treatment
which
carried
away
the
latter
generally
carried
away
the
former
with
it
after
the
passion
had
come
and
gone
she
would
obey
had
it
been
otherwise
had
she
been
sullen
and
obstinate
as
well
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
come
of
it
or
how
we
could
have
got
on
at
all
miss
bowdler
i
am
afraid
would
have
had
a
very
satisfactory
crow
over
papa
i
have
seen
him
sit
for
minutes
in
silent
contemplation
of
the
little
puzzle
trying
no
doubt
to
fit
her
into
his
theories
or
as
my
mother
said
to
find
her
a
stool
and
a
corner
somewhere
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
we
were
certain
something
or
other
would
come
out
of
that
pondering
though
whether
the
same
night
or
a
twelvemonth
after
no
one
could
tell
i
believe
the
main
result
of
his
thinking
was
that
he
did
less
and
less
with
her
why
do
you
take
so
little
notice
of
the
child
my
mother
said
to
him
one
evening
it
is
all
your
doing
that
she
is
here
you
know
you
must
cast
her
off
now
cast
her
off
exclaimed
my
father
what
you
mean
ethel
you
never
speak
to
her
now
oh
yes
i
do
sometimes
why
only
sometimes
because
i
believe
because
i
am
a
little
afraid
of
her
i
do
know
how
to
attack
the
small
enemy
she
seems
to
be
and
generally
impregnable
but
you
must
therefore
make
afraid
of
i
do
know
that
i
suspect
it
is
my
only
chance
with
her
she
wants
a
little
of
mount
sinai
in
order
that
she
may
know
where
the
manna
comes
from
but
indeed
i
am
laying
myself
out
only
to
catch
the
little
soul
i
am
but
watching
and
pondering
how
to
reach
her
i
am
biding
my
time
to
come
in
with
my
small
stone
for
the
building
up
of
this
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
at
that
very
moment
in
the
last
fold
of
the
twilight
with
the
moon
rising
above
the
wooded
brow
of
gorman
slope
the
nurse
came
through
the
darkening
air
her
figure
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
dusk
saying
please
have
you
seen
miss
theodora
i
do
want
you
to
call
her
said
my
father
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
nurse
i
forgot
i
have
not
seen
her
for
an
hour
or
more
said
my
mother
i
declare
said
my
father
i
get
a
retriever
pup
and
train
him
to
find
theodora
he
will
be
capable
in
a
few
months
and
she
will
be
foolish
for
years
upon
this
occasion
the
truant
was
found
in
the
sitting
in
a
corner
upon
a
heap
of
straw
quite
in
the
dark
she
was
discovered
only
by
the
munching
of
her
little
teeth
for
she
had
found
some
wizened
apples
and
was
busy
devouring
them
but
my
father
actually
did
what
he
had
said
a
favorite
spaniel
had
pups
a
few
days
after
and
he
took
one
of
them
in
hand
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
nose
of
wagtail
as
the
children
had
named
him
in
which
doubtless
was
gathered
the
experience
of
many
thoughtful
generations
had
learned
to
track
theodora
to
whatever
retreat
she
might
have
chosen
and
very
amusing
it
was
to
watch
the
course
of
the
proceedings
some
one
would
come
running
to
my
father
with
the
news
that
theo
was
in
hiding
then
my
father
would
give
a
peculiar
whistle
and
wagtail
who
i
must
say
very
seldom
failed
to
respond
would
come
bounding
to
his
side
it
was
necessary
that
my
father
should
him
is
that
the
phrase
for
he
would
heed
no
directions
from
any
one
else
it
was
not
necessary
to
follow
him
however
which
would
have
involved
a
tortuous
and
fatiguing
pursuit
but
in
a
little
while
a
joyous
barking
would
be
heard
always
kept
up
until
the
ready
pursuers
were
guided
by
the
sound
to
the
place
there
theo
was
certain
to
be
found
hugging
the
animal
without
the
least
notion
of
the
traitorous
character
of
his
blandishments
it
was
long
before
she
began
to
discover
that
there
was
danger
in
that
dog
nose
thus
wagtail
became
a
very
important
member
of
the
family
a
bond
of
union
in
fact
between
its
parts
disappearances
however
became
less
and
less
frequent
not
that
she
made
fewer
attempts
to
abscond
but
that
every
one
knowing
how
likely
she
was
to
vanish
whoever
she
was
with
had
come
to
feel
the
necessity
of
keeping
both
eyes
upon
her
chapter
ix
the
foundling
one
evening
during
this
my
first
visit
to
my
home
we
had
gone
to
take
tea
with
the
widow
of
an
old
servant
who
lived
in
a
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
the
home
farm
connie
and
i
in
the
pony
carriage
and
my
father
and
mother
on
foot
it
was
quite
dark
when
we
returned
for
the
moon
was
late
connie
and
i
got
home
first
though
we
had
a
good
round
to
make
and
the
path
across
the
fields
was
but
a
third
of
the
distance
for
my
father
and
mother
were
lovers
and
sure
to
be
late
when
left
out
by
themselves
when
we
arrived
there
was
no
one
to
take
the
pony
and
when
i
rung
the
bell
no
one
answered
i
could
not
leave
connie
in
the
carriage
to
go
and
look
so
we
waited
and
waited
till
we
were
getting
very
tired
and
glad
indeed
we
were
to
hear
the
voices
of
my
father
and
mother
as
they
came
through
the
shrubbery
my
mother
went
to
the
rear
to
make
inquiry
and
came
back
with
the
news
that
theo
was
missing
and
that
they
had
been
searching
for
her
in
vain
for
nearly
an
hour
my
father
instantly
called
wagtail
and
sent
him
after
her
we
then
got
connie
in
and
laid
her
on
the
sofa
where
i
kept
her
company
while
the
rest
went
in
different
directions
listening
from
what
quarter
would
come
the
welcome
voice
of
the
dog
this
was
so
long
delayed
however
that
my
father
began
to
get
alarmed
at
last
he
whistled
very
loud
and
in
a
little
while
wagtail
came
creeping
to
his
feet
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
no
wag
left
in
it
clearly
ashamed
of
himself
my
father
was
now
thoroughly
frightened
and
began
questioning
the
household
as
to
the
latest
knowledge
of
the
child
it
then
occurred
to
one
of
the
servants
to
mention
that
a
woman
had
been
seen
about
the
place
in
the
morning
a
tall
dark
woman
with
a
gypsy
look
she
had
come
begging
but
my
father
orders
were
so
strict
concerning
such
cases
that
nothing
had
been
given
her
and
she
had
gone
away
in
anger
as
soon
as
he
heard
this
my
father
ordered
his
horse
and
told
two
of
the
men
to
get
ready
to
accompany
him
in
the
mean
time
he
came
to
us
in
the
little
trying
to
look
calm
but
evidently
in
much
perturbation
he
said
he
had
little
doubt
the
woman
had
taken
her
could
it
be
her
mother
said
my
mother
who
can
tell
returned
my
father
it
is
the
less
likely
that
the
deed
seems
to
have
been
prompted
by
revenge
if
she
be
a
gypsy
child
said
my
mother
the
gypsies
interrupted
my
father
have
always
been
more
given
to
taking
other
people
children
than
forsaking
their
own
but
one
of
them
might
have
had
reason
for
being
ashamed
of
her
child
and
dreading
the
severity
of
her
family
might
have
abandoned
it
with
the
intention
of
repossessing
herself
of
it
and
passing
it
off
as
the
child
of
gentlefolks
she
had
picked
up
i
do
know
their
habits
and
ways
sufficiently
but
from
what
i
have
heard
that
seems
possible
however
it
is
not
so
easy
as
it
might
have
been
once
to
succeed
in
such
an
attempt
if
we
should
fail
in
finding
her
the
police
all
over
the
country
can
be
apprised
of
the
fact
in
a
few
hours
and
the
thief
can
hardly
escape
but
if
she
be
the
mother
suggested
my
mother
she
will
have
to
that
and
then
what
then
returned
my
father
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
stopping
now
and
then
to
listen
for
the
horses
hoofs
would
you
give
her
up
persisted
my
mother
still
my
father
made
no
reply
he
was
evidently
much
agitated
more
i
fancied
by
my
mother
question
than
by
the
present
trouble
he
left
the
room
and
presently
his
whistle
for
wagtail
pierced
the
still
air
a
moment
more
and
we
heard
them
all
ride
out
of
the
paved
yard
i
had
never
known
him
leave
my
mother
without
an
answer
before
we
who
were
left
behind
were
in
evil
plight
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
amongst
the
women
i
am
certain
while
harry
was
in
floods
of
tears
and
charley
was
bowling
we
could
not
send
them
to
bed
in
such
a
state
so
we
kept
them
with
us
in
the
where
they
soon
fell
fast
asleep
one
in
an
the
other
on
a
sheepskin
mat
connie
lay
quite
still
and
my
mother
talked
so
sweetly
and
gently
that
she
soon
made
me
quiet
too
but
i
was
haunted
with
the
idea
somehow
i
think
i
must
have
been
wandering
a
little
for
i
was
not
well
that
it
was
a
child
of
my
own
that
was
lost
out
in
the
dark
night
and
that
i
could
not
anyhow
reach
her
i
can
not
explain
the
odd
kind
of
feeling
it
was
as
if
a
dream
had
wandered
out
of
the
region
of
sleep
and
my
waking
brain
every
now
and
then
my
mother
voice
would
bring
me
back
to
my
senses
and
i
would
understand
it
all
perfectly
but
in
a
few
moments
i
would
be
involved
once
more
in
a
mazy
search
after
my
child
perhaps
however
as
it
was
by
that
time
late
sleep
had
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
invaded
a
part
of
my
brain
leaving
another
part
able
to
receive
the
impressions
of
the
external
about
me
i
can
recall
some
of
the
things
my
mother
said
one
in
particular
it
is
more
absurd
she
said
to
trust
god
by
halves
than
it
is
not
to
believe
in
him
at
all
your
papa
taught
me
that
before
one
of
you
was
born
when
my
mother
said
any
thing
in
the
way
of
teaching
us
which
was
not
often
she
would
generally
add
your
papa
taught
me
that
as
if
she
would
take
refuge
from
the
assumption
of
teaching
even
her
own
girls
but
we
set
a
good
deal
of
such
assertion
down
to
her
modesty
and
the
evidently
inextricable
blending
of
the
thought
of
my
father
with
every
movement
of
her
mental
life
i
remember
quite
well
she
went
on
how
he
made
that
truth
dawn
upon
me
one
night
as
we
sat
together
beside
the
old
mill
ah
you
do
remember
the
old
mill
it
was
pulled
down
while
wynnie
was
a
mere
baby
no
mamma
i
remember
it
perfectly
i
said
do
you
really
well
we
were
sitting
beside
the
mill
one
sunday
evening
after
service
for
we
always
had
a
walk
before
going
home
from
church
you
would
hardly
think
it
now
but
after
preaching
he
was
then
always
depressed
and
the
more
eloquently
he
had
spoken
the
more
he
felt
as
if
he
had
made
an
utter
failure
at
first
i
thought
it
came
only
from
fatigue
and
wanted
him
to
go
home
and
rest
but
he
would
say
he
liked
nature
to
come
before
supper
for
nature
restored
him
by
telling
him
that
it
was
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
if
he
had
failed
whereas
his
supper
only
made
him
feel
that
he
would
do
better
next
time
well
that
night
you
will
easily
believe
he
startled
me
when
he
said
after
sitting
for
some
time
silent
if
that
were
to
drop
down
dead
now
and
god
not
care
god
would
not
be
god
any
longer
doubtless
i
showed
myself
something
between
puzzled
and
shocked
for
he
proceeded
with
some
haste
to
explain
to
me
how
what
he
had
said
was
true
belongs
to
god
is
essential
to
god
he
said
is
one
pure
clean
essence
of
being
to
use
our
poor
words
to
describe
the
indescribable
nothing
hangs
about
him
that
does
not
belong
to
him
that
he
could
part
with
and
be
nothing
the
worse
still
less
is
there
any
thing
he
could
part
with
and
be
the
worse
whatever
belongs
to
him
is
of
his
own
kind
is
part
of
himself
so
to
speak
therefore
there
is
nothing
indifferent
to
his
character
to
be
found
in
him
and
therefore
when
our
lord
says
not
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
without
our
father
that
being
a
fact
with
regard
to
god
must
be
an
essential
fact
one
namely
without
which
he
could
be
no
god
i
understood
him
i
thought
but
many
a
time
since
when
a
fresh
light
has
broken
in
upon
me
i
have
thought
i
understood
him
then
only
for
the
first
time
i
told
him
so
once
and
he
said
he
thought
that
would
be
the
way
forever
with
all
truth
we
should
never
get
to
the
bottom
of
any
truth
because
it
was
a
vital
portion
of
the
all
of
truth
which
is
god
i
had
never
heard
so
much
philosophy
from
my
mother
before
i
believe
she
was
led
into
it
by
her
fear
of
the
effect
our
anxiety
about
the
child
might
have
upon
us
with
what
had
quieted
her
heart
in
the
old
time
she
sought
now
to
quiet
ours
helping
us
to
trust
in
the
great
love
that
never
ceases
to
watch
and
she
did
make
us
quiet
but
the
time
glided
so
slowly
past
that
it
seemed
immovable
when
twelve
struck
we
heard
in
the
stillness
every
clock
in
the
house
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
have
done
my
mother
left
the
room
and
came
back
with
three
shawls
with
which
having
first
laid
harry
on
the
rug
she
covered
the
boys
and
dora
who
also
was
by
this
time
fast
asleep
curled
up
at
connie
feet
still
the
time
went
on
and
there
was
no
sound
of
horses
or
any
thing
to
break
the
silence
except
the
faint
murmur
which
now
and
then
the
trees
will
make
in
the
quietest
night
as
if
they
were
dreaming
and
talked
in
their
sleep
for
the
motion
does
not
seem
to
pass
beyond
them
but
to
swell
up
and
die
again
in
the
heart
of
them
this
and
the
occasional
cry
of
an
owl
was
all
that
broke
the
silent
flow
of
the
undivided
moments
flowing
none
can
tell
how
we
seldom
spoke
and
at
length
the
house
within
seemed
possessed
by
the
silence
from
without
but
we
were
all
ear
one
hungry
ear
whose
famine
was
silence
listening
intently
we
were
not
so
far
from
the
high
road
but
that
on
a
night
like
this
the
penetrating
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
might
reach
us
hence
when
my
mother
who
was
keener
of
hearing
than
any
of
her
daughters
at
length
started
up
saying
i
hear
them
they
coming
the
doubt
remained
whether
it
might
not
be
the
sound
of
some
hurrying
along
that
high
road
that
she
had
heard
but
when
also
heard
the
sound
of
horses
we
knew
they
must
belong
to
our
company
for
except
the
riders
were
within
the
gates
their
noises
could
not
have
come
nearer
to
the
house
my
mother
hurried
down
to
the
hall
i
would
have
staid
with
connie
but
she
begged
me
to
go
too
and
come
back
as
soon
as
i
knew
the
result
so
i
followed
my
mother
as
i
descended
the
stairs
notwithstanding
my
anxiety
i
could
not
help
seeing
what
a
picture
lay
before
me
for
i
had
learned
already
to
regard
things
from
the
picturesque
point
of
view
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
on
the
heads
of
the
listening
anxious
group
of
women
my
mother
at
the
open
door
with
the
housekeeper
and
her
maid
and
the
visible
through
the
door
in
the
moonlight
beyond
the
first
news
that
reached
me
was
my
father
shout
the
moment
he
rounded
the
sweep
that
brought
him
in
sight
of
the
house
all
right
here
she
is
he
cried
and
ere
i
could
reach
the
stair
to
run
up
to
connie
wagtail
was
jumping
upon
me
and
barking
furiously
he
rushed
up
before
me
with
the
scramble
of
twenty
feet
licked
connie
face
all
over
in
spite
of
her
efforts
at
then
rushed
at
dora
and
the
boys
one
after
the
other
and
woke
them
all
up
he
was
satisfied
enough
with
himself
now
his
tail
was
doing
the
wagging
of
forty
there
was
no
tucking
of
it
away
now
no
drooping
of
the
head
in
mute
confession
of
conscious
worthlessness
he
was
a
dog
because
his
master
was
well
pleased
with
him
but
here
i
am
talking
about
the
dog
and
forgetting
what
was
going
on
below
my
father
cantered
up
to
the
door
followed
by
the
two
men
my
mother
hurried
to
meet
him
and
then
only
saw
the
little
lost
lamb
asleep
in
his
bosom
he
gave
her
up
and
my
mother
ran
in
with
her
while
he
dismounted
and
walked
merrily
but
wearily
up
the
stair
after
her
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
quiet
the
dog
the
next
to
sit
down
beside
connie
the
third
to
say
thank
god
and
the
next
god
bless
wagtail
my
mother
was
already
undressing
the
little
darling
and
her
maid
was
gone
to
fetch
her
night
things
tumbled
hither
and
thither
she
did
not
wake
but
was
carried
off
to
her
crib
then
my
father
for
whom
some
supper
of
which
he
was
in
great
need
had
been
brought
as
soon
as
he
had
had
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
mouthful
or
two
of
cold
chicken
began
to
tell
us
the
whole
story
chapter
wagtail
comes
to
honor
as
they
rode
out
of
the
gate
one
of
the
men
a
trustworthy
man
who
cared
for
his
horses
like
his
children
and
knew
all
their
individualities
as
few
men
know
those
of
their
children
rode
up
along
side
of
my
father
and
told
him
that
there
was
an
encampment
of
gypsies
on
the
moor
about
five
miles
away
just
over
gorman
slope
remarking
that
if
the
woman
had
taken
the
child
and
belonged
to
them
she
would
certainly
carry
her
thither
my
father
thought
in
the
absence
of
other
indication
they
ought
to
follow
the
suggestion
and
told
burton
to
guide
them
to
the
place
as
rapidly
as
possible
after
half
an
hour
sharp
riding
they
came
in
view
of
the
camp
or
rather
of
a
rising
ground
behind
which
it
lay
in
the
hollow
the
other
servant
was
an
old
man
who
had
been
to
a
baronet
in
the
next
county
and
knew
as
much
of
the
ways
of
wild
animals
as
burton
did
of
those
of
his
horses
it
was
his
turn
now
to
address
my
father
who
had
halted
for
a
moment
to
think
what
ought
to
be
done
next
she
ca
well
have
got
here
before
us
sir
with
that
child
to
carry
but
it
wonderful
what
the
likes
of
her
can
do
i
think
i
had
better
have
a
peep
over
the
brow
first
she
may
be
there
already
or
she
may
not
but
if
we
find
out
we
shall
know
better
what
to
do
i
go
with
you
said
my
father
no
sir
excuse
me
that
wo
do
you
ca
creep
like
a
sarpent
i
can
they
never
know
i
a
stalking
of
them
no
more
you
could
show
fight
if
need
was
you
know
sir
how
did
you
find
that
out
sim
asked
my
father
a
little
amused
notwithstanding
the
weight
at
his
heart
why
sir
they
do
say
a
clergyman
must
show
fight
who
told
you
that
sim
he
persisted
well
i
ca
say
sir
only
it
would
be
respectable
would
it
sir
there
nothing
respectable
but
what
right
sim
and
what
right
always
respectable
though
it
may
so
one
bit
suppose
you
was
to
get
a
black
eye
sir
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
martyrs
sim
yes
sir
i
heerd
you
talk
on
in
the
pulpit
sir
well
they
did
get
black
eyes
only
they
got
black
all
over
you
know
burnt
black
and
what
for
do
you
think
now
do
know
sir
except
it
was
for
doing
right
that
just
it
was
it
any
disgrace
to
them
no
sure
sir
well
if
i
were
to
get
a
black
eye
for
the
sake
of
the
child
would
that
be
any
disgrace
to
me
sim
none
that
i
knows
on
sir
only
it
bad
yes
no
doubt
people
might
think
i
had
got
into
a
row
at
the
griffin
and
yet
i
should
be
ashamed
of
it
i
should
count
my
black
eye
the
more
respectable
of
the
two
i
should
also
regard
the
evil
judgment
much
as
another
black
eye
and
wait
till
they
both
came
round
again
lead
on
sim
they
left
their
horses
with
burton
and
went
toward
the
camp
but
when
they
reached
the
slope
behind
which
it
lay
much
to
sim
discomfiture
my
father
instead
of
lying
down
at
the
foot
of
it
as
he
expected
and
creeping
up
the
side
of
it
after
the
doom
of
the
serpent
walked
right
up
over
the
brow
and
straight
into
the
camp
followed
by
wagtail
there
was
nothing
going
on
neither
tinkering
nor
cooking
all
seemed
asleep
but
presently
out
of
two
or
three
of
the
tents
the
dingy
squalor
of
which
no
moonshine
could
silver
over
came
three
or
four
men
half
undressed
who
demanded
of
my
father
in
no
gentle
tones
what
he
wanted
there
i
tell
you
all
about
it
he
answered
i
the
parson
of
this
parish
and
therefore
you
my
own
people
you
see
we
do
go
to
church
parson
said
one
of
them
i
do
care
you
my
own
people
for
all
that
and
i
want
your
help
well
what
the
matter
who
cow
dead
said
the
same
man
this
evening
returned
my
father
one
of
my
children
is
missing
and
a
woman
who
might
be
one
of
your
clan
mind
i
say
i
do
know
and
i
mean
no
offence
but
such
a
woman
was
seen
about
the
place
all
i
want
is
the
child
and
if
i
do
find
her
i
shall
have
to
raise
the
county
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
disturb
you
but
i
am
afraid
in
that
case
whether
the
woman
be
one
of
you
or
not
the
place
will
be
too
hot
for
you
i
no
enemy
to
honest
gypsies
but
you
know
there
is
a
set
of
tramps
that
call
themselves
gypsies
who
are
nothing
of
the
sort
only
thieves
tell
me
what
i
had
better
do
to
find
my
child
you
know
all
about
such
things
the
men
turned
to
each
other
and
began
talking
in
undertones
and
in
a
language
of
which
what
my
father
heard
he
could
not
understand
at
length
the
spokesman
of
the
party
addressed
him
again
we
give
you
our
word
sir
if
that
will
satisfy
you
he
said
more
respectfully
than
he
had
spoken
before
to
send
the
child
home
directly
if
any
one
should
bring
her
to
our
camp
that
all
we
can
say
my
father
saw
that
his
best
chance
lay
in
accepting
the
offer
thank
you
he
said
perhaps
i
may
have
an
opportunity
of
serving
you
some
day
they
in
their
turn
thanked
him
politely
enough
and
my
father
and
sim
left
the
camp
upon
this
side
the
moor
was
skirted
by
a
plantation
which
had
been
gradually
creeping
up
the
hill
from
the
more
sheltered
hollow
it
was
here
bordered
by
a
deep
trench
the
bottom
of
which
was
full
of
young
firs
through
the
plantation
there
was
a
succession
of
green
rides
by
which
the
outskirts
of
my
father
property
could
be
reached
but
the
moon
being
now
up
my
father
resolved
to
cross
the
trench
and
halt
for
a
time
watching
the
moor
from
the
shelter
of
the
firs
on
the
chance
of
the
woman
making
her
appearance
for
if
she
belonged
to
the
camp
she
would
most
probably
approach
it
from
the
plantation
and
might
be
overtaken
before
she
could
cross
the
moor
to
reach
it
they
had
lain
ensconced
in
the
firs
for
about
half
an
hour
when
suddenly
without
any
warning
wagtail
rushed
into
the
underwood
and
vanished
they
listened
with
all
their
ears
and
in
a
few
moments
heard
his
joyous
bark
followed
instantly
however
by
a
howl
of
pain
and
before
they
had
got
many
yards
in
pursuit
he
came
cowering
to
my
father
feet
who
patting
his
side
found
it
bleeding
he
bound
his
handkerchief
round
him
and
fastening
the
lash
of
sim
whip
to
his
collar
that
he
might
not
go
too
fast
for
them
told
him
to
find
theodora
instantly
he
pulled
away
through
the
brushwood
giving
a
little
yelp
now
and
then
as
the
stiff
remnant
of
some
broken
twig
or
stem
hurt
his
wounded
side
before
we
reached
the
spot
for
which
he
was
making
however
my
father
heard
a
rustling
nearer
to
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
and
the
same
moment
wagtail
turned
and
tugged
fiercely
in
that
direction
the
figure
of
a
woman
rose
up
against
the
sky
and
began
to
run
for
the
open
space
beyond
wagtail
and
my
father
pursued
at
speed
my
father
crying
out
that
if
she
did
not
stop
he
would
loose
the
dog
on
her
she
paid
no
heed
but
ran
on
mount
and
head
her
sim
mount
burton
ride
over
every
thing
cried
my
father
as
he
slipped
wagtail
who
shot
through
the
underwood
like
a
bird
just
as
she
reached
the
trench
and
in
an
instant
had
her
by
the
gown
my
father
saw
something
gleam
in
the
moonlight
and
again
a
howl
broke
from
wagtail
who
was
evidently
once
more
wounded
but
he
held
on
and
now
the
horsemen
having
crossed
the
trench
were
approaching
her
in
front
and
my
father
was
hard
upon
her
behind
she
gave
a
peculiar
cry
half
a
shriek
and
half
a
howl
clasped
the
child
to
her
bosom
and
stood
rooted
like
a
tree
evidently
in
the
hope
that
her
friends
hearing
her
signal
would
come
to
her
rescue
but
it
was
too
late
my
father
rushed
upon
her
the
instant
she
cried
out
the
dog
was
holding
her
by
the
poor
ragged
skirt
and
the
horses
were
reined
snorting
on
the
bank
above
her
she
heaved
up
the
child
over
her
head
but
whether
in
appeal
to
heaven
or
about
to
dash
her
to
the
earth
in
the
rage
of
frustration
she
was
not
allowed
time
to
show
for
my
father
caught
both
her
uplifted
arms
with
his
so
that
she
could
not
lower
them
and
burton
having
flung
himself
from
his
horse
and
come
behind
her
easily
took
theodora
from
them
for
from
their
position
they
were
almost
powerless
then
my
father
called
off
wagtail
and
the
poor
creature
sunk
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
trench
amongst
the
young
firs
without
a
sound
and
there
lay
my
father
went
up
to
her
but
she
only
stared
at
him
with
big
blank
black
eyes
and
yet
such
a
lost
look
on
her
young
handsome
yet
gaunt
face
as
almost
convinced
him
she
was
the
mother
of
the
child
but
whatever
might
be
her
rights
she
could
not
be
allowed
to
recover
possession
without
those
who
had
saved
and
tended
the
child
having
a
word
in
the
matter
of
her
fate
as
he
was
thinking
what
he
could
say
to
her
sim
voice
reached
his
ear
they
coming
over
the
brow
sir
five
or
six
from
the
camp
we
better
be
off
the
child
is
safe
he
said
as
he
turned
to
leave
her
from
she
rejoined
in
a
pitiful
tone
and
this
ambiguous
utterance
was
all
that
fell
from
her
my
father
mounted
hurriedly
took
the
child
from
burton
and
rode
away
followed
by
the
two
men
and
wagtail
through
the
green
rides
they
galloped
in
the
moonlight
and
were
soon
beyond
all
danger
of
pursuit
when
they
slackened
pace
my
father
instructed
sim
to
find
out
all
he
could
about
the
gypsies
if
possible
to
learn
their
names
and
to
what
tribe
or
community
they
belonged
sim
promised
to
do
what
was
in
his
power
but
said
he
did
not
expect
much
success
the
children
had
listened
to
the
story
wide
awake
wagtail
was
lying
at
my
father
feet
licking
his
wounds
which
were
not
very
serious
and
had
stopped
bleeding
it
is
all
your
doing
wagtail
said
harry
patting
the
dog
i
think
he
deserves
to
be
called
wagtail
said
charley
and
from
that
day
he
was
no
more
called
bare
wagtail
but
wagtail
much
to
the
amusement
of
visitors
who
hearing
the
name
gravely
uttered
as
it
soon
came
to
be
saw
the
owner
of
it
approach
on
all
fours
with
a
tireless
pendulum
in
his
rear
chapter
xi
a
stupid
chapter
before
proceeding
with
my
own
story
i
must
mention
that
my
father
took
every
means
in
his
power
to
find
out
something
about
the
woman
and
the
gang
of
gypsies
to
which
she
appeared
to
belong
i
believe
he
had
no
definite
end
in
view
further
than
the
desire
to
be
able
at
some
future
time
to
enter
into
such
relations
with
her
for
her
own
and
her
daughter
sake
if
indeed
theodora
were
her
daughter
as
might
be
possible
but
the
very
next
day
he
found
that
they
had
already
vanished
from
the
place
and
all
the
inquiries
he
set
on
foot
by
means
of
friends
and
through
the
country
constabulary
were
of
no
avail
i
believe
he
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
in
what
had
occurred
thinking
he
ought
to
have
laid
himself
out
at
the
time
to
discover
whether
she
was
indeed
the
mother
and
in
that
case
to
do
for
her
what
he
could
probably
had
he
done
so
he
would
only
have
heaped
difficulty
upon
difficulty
but
as
it
was
if
he
was
saved
from
trouble
he
was
not
delivered
from
uneasiness
clearly
however
the
child
must
not
be
exposed
to
the
danger
of
the
repetition
of
the
attempt
and
the
whole
household
was
now
so
fully
alive
to
the
necessity
of
not
losing
sight
of
her
for
a
moment
that
her
danger
was
far
less
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
before
i
continued
at
the
hall
for
six
weeks
during
which
my
husband
came
several
times
to
see
me
and
at
the
close
of
that
period
took
me
back
with
him
to
my
dear
little
home
the
rooms
all
but
the
study
looked
very
small
after
those
i
had
left
but
i
felt
notwithstanding
that
the
place
was
my
home
i
was
at
first
a
little
ashamed
of
the
feeling
for
why
should
i
be
anywhere
more
at
home
than
in
the
house
of
such
parents
as
mine
but
i
presume
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
the
queenly
element
in
every
woman
so
that
she
can
not
feel
perfectly
at
ease
without
something
to
govern
however
small
and
however
troublesome
her
queendom
may
be
at
my
father
i
had
every
ministration
possible
and
all
comforts
in
profusion
but
i
had
no
responsibilities
and
no
rule
so
that
sometimes
i
could
not
help
feeling
as
if
i
was
idle
although
i
knew
i
was
not
to
blame
besides
i
could
not
be
at
all
sure
that
my
big
bear
was
properly
attended
to
and
the
knowledge
that
he
was
the
most
independent
of
comforts
of
all
the
men
i
had
ever
come
into
any
relation
with
made
me
only
feel
the
more
anxious
that
he
should
not
be
left
to
his
own
neglect
for
although
my
father
for
instance
was
ready
to
part
with
any
thing
even
to
a
favorite
volume
if
the
good
reason
of
another
need
showed
itself
he
was
not
at
all
indifferent
in
his
own
person
to
being
comfortable
one
with
his
intense
power
of
enjoying
the
gentleness
of
the
universe
could
not
be
so
hence
it
was
always
easy
to
make
him
a
little
present
whereas
i
have
still
to
rack
my
brains
for
weeks
before
my
bear
birthday
comes
round
to
think
of
something
that
will
in
itself
have
a
chance
of
giving
him
pleasure
of
course
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
if
i
had
plenty
of
money
to
spare
and
had
to
muddle
it
all
away
in
paying
butchers
and
bakers
and
such
like
people
so
home
i
went
to
be
queen
again
friends
came
to
see
me
but
i
returned
few
of
their
calls
i
liked
best
to
sit
in
my
bedroom
i
would
have
preferred
sitting
in
my
wonderful
little
room
off
the
study
and
i
tried
that
first
but
the
same
morning
somebody
called
on
percivale
and
straightway
i
felt
myself
a
prisoner
the
moment
i
heard
the
strange
voice
through
the
door
i
wanted
to
get
out
and
could
not
of
course
such
a
risk
i
would
not
run
again
and
when
percivale
asked
me
the
next
day
if
i
would
not
go
down
with
him
i
told
him
i
could
not
bear
the
feeling
of
confinement
it
gave
me
i
did
mean
he
said
to
have
had
a
door
made
into
the
garden
for
you
and
i
consulted
an
architect
friend
on
the
subject
but
he
soon
satisfied
me
it
would
make
the
room
much
too
cold
for
you
and
so
i
was
compelled
to
give
up
the
thought
you
dear
i
said
that
was
all
but
it
was
enough
for
percivale
who
never
bothered
me
as
i
have
heard
of
husbands
doing
for
demonstrations
either
of
gratitude
or
affection
such
must
be
of
the
sort
who
can
only
read
large
print
so
i
betook
myself
to
my
chamber
and
there
sat
and
worked
for
i
did
a
good
deal
of
now
although
i
had
never
been
fond
of
it
as
a
girl
the
constant
recurrence
of
similar
motions
of
the
fingers
one
stitch
just
the
same
as
another
in
countless
repetition
varied
only
by
the
bother
when
the
thread
grew
short
and
would
slip
out
of
the
eye
of
the
needle
and
yet
not
short
enough
to
be
exchanged
with
still
more
bother
for
one
too
long
had
been
so
wearisome
to
me
in
former
days
that
i
spent
half
my
in
getting
the
done
for
me
which
my
mother
and
sister
did
for
themselves
for
this
my
father
praised
me
and
my
mother
tried
to
scold
me
and
could
but
now
it
was
all
so
different
instead
of
toiling
at
plain
stitching
and
hemming
and
sewing
i
seemed
to
be
working
a
bit
of
lovely
tapestry
all
the
time
so
many
thoughts
and
so
many
pictures
went
weaving
themselves
into
the
work
while
every
little
bit
finished
appeared
so
much
of
the
labor
of
the
universe
actually
done
accomplished
ended
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
began
to
feel
myself
of
consequence
enough
to
be
taken
care
of
i
remember
once
laying
down
the
little
what
i
was
working
at
but
i
am
growing
too
communicative
and
important
my
father
used
often
to
say
that
the
commonest
things
in
the
world
were
the
loveliest
sky
and
water
and
grass
and
such
now
i
found
that
the
commonest
feelings
of
humanity
for
what
feelings
could
be
commoner
than
those
which
now
made
me
blessed
amongst
women
are
those
that
are
fullest
of
the
divine
surely
this
looks
as
if
there
were
a
god
of
the
whole
earth
as
if
the
world
existed
in
the
very
foundations
of
its
history
and
continuance
by
the
immediate
thought
of
a
causing
thought
for
simply
because
the
life
of
the
world
was
moving
on
towards
its
unseen
goal
and
i
knew
it
and
had
a
helpless
share
in
it
i
felt
as
if
god
was
with
me
i
do
not
say
i
always
felt
like
this
far
from
it
there
were
times
when
life
itself
seemed
vanishing
in
an
abyss
of
nothingness
when
all
my
consciousness
consisted
in
this
that
i
knew
i
was
and
when
i
could
not
believe
that
i
should
ever
be
restored
to
the
of
existence
the
worst
of
it
was
that
in
such
moods
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
hitherto
been
deluding
myself
with
rainbow
fancies
as
often
as
i
had
been
aware
of
blessedness
as
there
was
in
fact
no
wine
of
life
apart
from
its
effervescence
but
when
one
day
i
told
percivale
not
while
i
was
thus
oppressed
for
then
i
could
not
speak
but
in
a
happier
moment
whose
happiness
i
mistrusted
something
of
what
i
felt
he
said
one
thing
which
has
comforted
me
ever
since
in
such
circumstances
do
grumble
at
the
poverty
darling
by
which
another
is
made
rich
i
confess
i
did
not
see
all
at
once
what
he
meant
but
i
did
after
thinking
over
it
for
a
while
and
if
i
have
learned
any
valuable
lesson
in
my
life
it
is
this
that
no
one
feelings
are
a
measure
of
eternal
facts
the
winter
passed
slowly
away
fog
rain
frost
snow
thaw
succeeding
one
another
in
all
the
seeming
disorder
of
the
season
a
good
many
things
happened
i
believe
but
i
do
remember
any
of
them
my
mother
wrote
offering
me
dora
for
a
companion
but
somehow
i
preferred
being
without
her
one
great
comfort
was
good
news
about
connie
who
was
getting
on
famously
but
even
this
moved
me
so
little
that
i
began
to
think
i
was
turning
into
a
crab
utterly
incased
in
the
shell
of
my
own
selfishness
the
thought
made
me
cry
the
fact
that
i
could
cry
consoled
me
for
how
could
i
be
heartless
so
long
as
i
could
cry
but
then
came
the
thought
it
was
for
myself
my
own
i
was
crying
not
certainly
for
joy
that
connie
was
getting
better
at
least
however
i
said
to
myself
i
am
not
content
to
be
selfish
i
am
a
little
troubled
that
i
am
not
good
and
then
i
tried
to
look
up
and
get
my
needlework
which
always
did
me
good
by
helping
me
to
reflect
it
is
i
ca
help
thinking
a
great
pity
that
needlework
is
going
so
much
out
of
fashion
for
it
tends
more
to
make
a
woman
one
who
thinks
that
is
acquainted
with
herself
than
all
the
sermons
she
is
ever
likely
to
hear
my
father
came
to
see
me
several
times
and
was
all
himself
to
me
but
i
could
not
feel
quite
comfortable
with
him
i
do
in
the
least
know
why
i
am
afraid
much
afraid
it
indicates
something
very
wrong
in
me
somewhere
but
he
seemed
to
understand
me
and
always
the
moment
he
left
me
the
tide
of
confidence
began
to
flow
afresh
in
the
ocean
that
lay
about
the
little
island
of
my
troubles
then
i
knew
he
was
my
own
father
something
that
even
my
husband
could
not
be
and
would
not
wish
to
be
to
me
in
the
month
of
march
my
mother
came
to
see
me
and
that
was
all
pleasure
my
father
did
not
always
see
when
i
was
not
able
to
listen
to
him
though
he
was
most
considerate
when
he
did
but
my
mother
why
to
be
with
her
was
like
being
with
one
own
i
was
actually
going
to
write
there
is
nothing
better
than
that
when
a
woman
is
in
such
trouble
except
it
be
what
my
father
knows
more
about
than
i
do
i
wish
i
did
know
about
it
she
brought
with
her
a
young
woman
to
take
the
place
of
cook
or
rather
general
servant
in
our
little
household
she
had
been
in
a
small
family
of
my
mother
acquaintance
and
had
a
good
character
for
honesty
and
plain
cooking
percivale
more
experienced
ear
soon
discovered
that
she
was
irish
this
fact
had
not
been
represented
to
my
mother
for
the
girl
had
been
in
england
from
childhood
and
her
mistress
seemed
either
not
to
have
known
it
or
not
to
have
thought
of
mentioning
it
certainly
my
mother
was
far
too
just
to
have
allowed
it
to
influence
her
choice
notwithstanding
the
prejudices
against
irish
women
in
english
families
prejudices
not
without
a
general
foundation
in
reason
for
my
part
i
should
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
mother
choice
even
if
i
had
not
been
so
indifferent
at
the
time
to
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
lower
regions
of
the
house
but
while
my
mother
was
there
i
knew
well
enough
that
nothing
could
go
wrong
and
my
housekeeping
mind
had
never
been
so
much
at
ease
since
we
were
married
it
was
very
delightful
not
to
be
accountable
and
for
the
present
i
felt
exonerated
from
all
responsibilities
chapter
xii
an
introduction
i
woke
one
morning
after
a
sound
sleep
not
so
sound
however
but
that
i
had
been
dreaming
and
that
when
i
awoke
i
could
recall
my
dream
it
was
a
very
odd
one
i
thought
i
was
a
hen
strutting
about
amongst
ricks
of
corn
picking
here
and
scratching
there
followed
by
a
whole
brood
of
chickens
toward
which
i
felt
exceedingly
benevolent
and
attentive
suddenly
i
heard
the
scream
of
a
hawk
in
the
air
above
me
and
instantly
gave
the
proper
cry
to
fetch
the
little
creatures
under
my
wings
they
came
scurrying
to
me
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
all
but
one
which
would
mind
my
cry
although
i
kept
repeating
it
again
and
again
meantime
the
hawk
kept
screaming
and
i
felt
as
if
i
did
care
for
any
of
those
that
were
safe
under
my
wings
but
only
for
the
solitary
creature
that
kept
pecking
away
as
if
nothing
was
the
matter
about
it
i
grew
so
terribly
anxious
that
at
length
i
woke
with
a
cry
of
misery
and
terror
the
moment
i
opened
my
eyes
there
was
my
mother
standing
beside
me
the
room
was
so
dark
that
i
thought
for
a
moment
what
a
fog
there
must
be
but
the
next
i
forgot
every
thing
at
hearing
a
little
cry
which
i
verily
believe
in
my
stupid
dream
i
had
taken
for
the
voice
of
the
hawk
whereas
it
was
the
cry
of
my
first
and
only
chicken
which
i
had
not
yet
seen
but
which
my
mother
now
held
in
her
grandmotherly
arms
ready
to
hand
her
to
me
i
dared
not
speak
for
i
felt
very
weak
and
was
afraid
of
crying
from
delight
i
looked
in
my
mother
face
and
she
folded
back
the
clothes
and
laid
the
baby
down
beside
me
with
its
little
head
resting
on
my
arm
draw
back
the
curtain
a
little
bit
mother
dear
i
whispered
and
let
me
see
what
it
is
like
i
believe
i
said
for
i
was
not
quite
a
mother
yet
my
mother
did
as
i
requested
a
ray
of
clear
spring
light
fell
upon
the
face
of
the
little
white
thing
by
my
side
for
white
she
was
though
most
babies
are
red
and
if
i
dared
not
speak
before
i
could
not
now
my
mother
went
away
again
and
sat
down
by
the
fireside
leaving
me
with
my
baby
never
shall
i
forget
the
unutterable
content
of
that
hour
it
was
not
gladness
nor
was
it
thankfulness
that
filled
my
heart
but
a
certain
absolute
contentment
just
on
the
point
but
for
my
want
of
strength
of
blossoming
into
unspeakable
gladness
and
thankfulness
somehow
too
there
was
mingled
with
it
a
sense
of
dignity
as
if
i
had
vindicated
for
myself
a
right
to
a
part
in
the
creation
for
was
i
not
proved
at
least
a
link
in
the
marvellous
chain
of
existence
in
carrying
on
the
designs
of
the
great
maker
not
that
the
thought
was
there
only
the
feeling
which
afterwards
found
the
thought
in
order
to
account
for
its
own
being
besides
the
state
of
perfect
repose
after
what
had
passed
was
in
itself
bliss
the
very
sense
of
weakness
was
delightful
for
i
had
earned
the
right
to
be
weak
to
rest
as
much
as
i
pleased
to
be
important
and
to
be
congratulated
somehow
i
had
got
through
the
trouble
lay
behind
me
and
here
for
the
sake
of
any
one
who
will
read
my
poor
words
i
record
the
conviction
that
in
one
way
or
other
special
individual
help
is
given
to
every
creature
to
endure
to
the
end
i
think
i
have
heard
my
father
say
and
hitherto
it
has
been
my
own
experience
that
always
when
suffering
whether
mental
or
bodily
approached
the
point
where
further
endurance
appeared
impossible
the
pulse
of
it
began
to
ebb
and
a
lull
ensued
i
do
not
venture
to
found
any
general
assertion
upon
this
i
only
state
it
as
a
fact
of
my
own
experience
he
who
does
not
allow
any
man
to
be
tempted
above
that
he
is
able
to
bear
doubtless
acts
in
the
same
way
in
all
kinds
of
trials
i
was
listening
to
the
gentle
talk
about
me
in
the
darkened
room
not
listening
indeed
only
aware
that
loving
words
were
spoken
whether
i
was
dozing
i
do
not
know
but
something
touched
my
lips
i
did
not
start
i
had
been
dreadfully
given
to
starting
for
a
long
time
so
much
so
that
i
was
quite
ashamed
sometimes
for
i
would
even
cry
out
i
who
had
always
been
so
sharp
on
feminine
affectations
before
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
startle
me
i
only
opened
my
eyes
and
there
was
my
great
big
huge
bear
looking
down
on
me
with
something
in
his
eyes
i
had
never
seen
there
before
but
even
his
presence
could
not
ripple
the
waters
of
my
deep
rest
i
gave
him
half
a
smile
i
knew
it
was
but
half
a
smile
but
i
thought
it
would
do
closed
my
eyes
and
sunk
again
not
into
sleep
but
into
that
same
blessed
repose
i
remember
wondering
if
i
should
feel
any
thing
like
that
for
the
first
hour
or
two
after
i
was
dead
may
there
not
one
day
be
such
a
repose
for
all
only
the
heavenly
counterpart
coming
of
perfect
activity
instead
of
weary
success
this
was
all
but
the
beginning
of
endlessly
varied
pleasures
i
dare
say
the
mothers
would
let
me
go
on
for
a
good
while
in
this
direction
perhaps
even
some
of
the
fathers
could
stand
a
little
more
of
it
but
i
must
remember
that
if
anybody
reads
this
at
all
it
will
have
multitudes
of
readers
in
whom
the
chord
which
could
alone
respond
to
such
experiences
hangs
loose
over
the
of
their
being
by
slow
degrees
the
daylight
the
light
of
work
that
is
began
to
penetrate
me
or
rather
to
rise
in
my
being
from
its
own
hidden
sun
first
i
began
to
wash
and
dress
my
baby
myself
one
who
has
not
tried
that
kind
of
amusement
can
not
know
what
endless
pleasure
it
affords
i
do
not
doubt
that
to
the
paternal
spectator
it
appears
monotonous
unproductive
unprogressive
but
then
he
looking
upon
it
from
the
outside
and
regarding
the
process
with
a
speculative
compassion
and
not
with
sympathy
so
can
not
know
the
communion
into
which
it
brings
you
with
the
baby
i
remember
well
enough
what
my
father
has
written
about
it
in
the
seaboard
parish
but
he
is
all
wrong
i
mean
him
to
confess
that
before
this
is
printed
if
things
were
done
as
he
proposes
the
tenderness
of
mothers
would
be
far
less
developed
and
the
moral
training
of
children
would
be
postponed
to
an
indefinite
period
there
papa
that
something
in
your
own
style
next
i
began
to
order
the
dinners
and
the
very
day
on
which
i
first
ordered
the
dinner
i
took
my
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
a
happier
little
party
well
of
course
i
saw
it
all
through
the
of
my
motherhood
but
i
am
nevertheless
bold
to
assert
that
my
husband
was
happy
and
that
my
mother
was
happy
and
if
there
was
one
more
guest
at
the
table
concerning
whom
i
am
not
prepared
to
assert
that
he
was
happy
i
can
confidently
affirm
that
he
was
merry
and
gracious
and
talkative
originating
three
parts
of
the
laughter
of
the
evening
to
watch
him
with
the
baby
was
a
pleasure
even
to
the
heart
of
a
mother
anxious
as
she
must
be
when
any
one
especially
a
gentleman
more
especially
a
bachelor
and
most
especially
a
young
bachelor
takes
her
precious
little
in
his
arms
and
pretends
to
know
all
about
the
management
of
such
it
was
he
indeed
who
introduced
her
to
the
for
leaving
the
table
during
dessert
he
returned
bearing
her
in
his
arms
to
my
astonishment
and
even
mild
maternal
indignation
at
the
liberty
resuming
his
seat
and
pouring
out
for
his
charge
as
he
pretended
a
glass
of
old
port
he
said
in
the
soberest
voice
charles
percivale
with
all
the
solemnity
suitable
to
the
occasion
i
the
old
moon
with
the
new
moon
in
my
arms
propose
the
health
of
miss
percivale
on
her
first
visit
to
this
boring
bullet
of
a
world
by
the
way
what
a
mercy
it
is
that
she
carries
her
atmosphere
with
her
here
i
stupidly
thinking
he
reflected
on
the
atmosphere
of
baby
rose
to
take
her
from
him
with
suppressed
indignation
for
why
should
a
man
who
assumes
a
baby
unbidden
be
so
very
much
nicer
than
a
woman
who
accepts
her
as
given
and
makes
the
best
of
it
but
he
declined
giving
her
up
i
not
pinching
her
he
said
no
but
i
am
afraid
you
find
her
disagreeable
on
the
contrary
she
is
the
nicest
of
little
ladies
for
she
lets
you
talk
all
the
nonsense
you
like
and
never
takes
the
least
offence
i
sat
down
again
directly
i
propose
her
health
he
repeated
coupled
with
that
of
her
mother
to
whom
i
for
one
am
more
obliged
than
i
can
explain
for
at
length
convincing
me
that
i
belong
no
more
to
the
youth
of
my
country
but
am
an
uncle
with
a
homuncle
in
his
arms
wifie
your
health
baby
yours
too
said
my
husband
and
the
ladies
drank
the
toast
in
silence
it
is
time
i
explained
who
this
fourth
or
should
i
say
fifth
person
in
our
family
party
was
he
was
the
younger
brother
of
my
percivale
by
name
roger
still
more
unsuccessful
than
he
of
similar
trustworthiness
but
less
equanimity
for
he
was
subject
to
sudden
elevations
and
depressions
of
the
inner
barometer
i
shall
have
more
to
tell
about
him
by
and
by
meantime
it
is
enough
to
mention
that
my
daughter
how
grand
i
thought
it
when
i
first
said
now
began
her
acquaintance
with
him
before
long
he
was
her
chief
favorite
next
to
her
mother
and
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
conscientiously
add
for
at
a
certain
early
period
of
her
history
the
child
showed
a
decided
preference
for
her
uncle
over
her
father
but
it
is
time
i
put
a
stop
to
this
ooze
of
maternal
memories
having
thus
introduced
my
baby
and
her
uncle
roger
i
close
the
chapter
chapter
xiii
my
first
a
negatived
proposal
it
may
well
be
believed
that
we
had
not
yet
seen
much
company
in
our
little
house
to
parties
my
husband
had
a
great
dislike
evening
parties
he
eschewed
utterly
and
never
accepted
an
invitation
to
dinner
except
it
were
to
the
house
of
a
friend
or
to
that
of
one
of
my
few
relatives
in
london
whom
for
my
sake
he
would
not
displease
there
were
not
many
even
among
his
whom
he
cared
to
visit
and
altogether
i
fear
he
passed
for
an
unsociable
man
i
am
certain
he
would
have
sold
more
pictures
if
he
had
accepted
what
invitations
came
in
his
way
but
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
would
i
knew
crystallize
his
dislike
into
a
resolve
one
day
after
i
had
got
quite
strong
again
as
i
was
sitting
by
him
in
the
study
with
my
baby
on
my
knee
i
proposed
that
we
should
ask
some
friends
to
dinner
instead
of
objecting
to
the
procedure
upon
general
principles
which
i
confess
i
had
half
anticipated
he
only
asked
me
whom
i
thought
of
inviting
when
i
mentioned
the
morleys
he
made
no
reply
but
went
on
with
his
painting
as
if
he
had
not
heard
me
whence
i
knew
of
course
that
the
proposal
was
disagreeable
to
him
you
see
we
have
been
twice
to
dine
with
them
i
said
well
do
you
think
that
enough
for
a
while
i
talking
of
asking
them
here
now
could
you
go
and
see
your
cousin
some
morning
instead
it
not
that
i
want
to
see
my
cousin
particularly
i
want
to
ask
them
to
dinner
oh
he
said
as
if
he
could
in
the
least
make
out
what
i
was
after
i
thought
people
asked
people
because
they
desired
their
company
but
you
see
we
owe
them
a
dinner
owe
them
a
dinner
did
you
borrow
one
then
percivale
why
will
you
pretend
to
be
so
stupid
perhaps
i
only
pretending
to
be
the
other
thing
do
you
consider
yourself
under
no
obligation
to
people
who
ask
you
to
dinner
none
in
the
least
if
i
accept
the
invitation
that
is
the
natural
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
surely
my
company
is
worth
my
dinner
it
is
far
more
trouble
to
me
to
put
on
black
clothes
and
a
white
choker
and
go
to
their
house
than
it
is
for
them
to
ask
me
or
in
a
house
like
theirs
to
have
the
necessary
preparations
made
for
receiving
me
in
a
manner
befitting
their
dignity
i
do
violence
to
my
own
feelings
in
going
is
not
that
enough
you
know
how
much
i
prefer
a
chop
with
my
wife
alone
to
the
grandest
dinner
the
grandest
of
her
grand
relations
could
give
me
now
do
you
make
game
of
my
grand
relations
i
not
sure
that
you
have
far
grander
relations
yourself
only
you
say
so
little
about
them
they
might
all
have
been
transported
for
housebreaking
tell
me
honestly
do
you
think
it
natural
if
a
friend
asks
you
to
dinner
that
you
should
ask
him
again
yes
if
it
would
give
him
any
pleasure
but
just
imagine
your
cousin
morley
dining
at
our
table
do
you
think
he
would
enjoy
it
of
course
we
must
have
somebody
in
to
help
jemima
and
somebody
to
wait
i
suppose
yes
of
course
percivale
and
what
thackeray
calls
cold
balls
handed
about
well
i
would
have
them
cold
but
they
would
be
i
was
by
this
time
so
nearly
crying
that
i
said
nothing
here
my
love
he
resumed
i
object
to
the
whole
thing
it
all
false
together
i
have
not
the
least
disinclination
to
asking
a
few
friends
who
would
enjoy
being
received
in
the
same
style
as
your
father
or
my
brother
namely
to
one
of
our
better
dinners
and
perhaps
something
better
to
drink
than
i
can
afford
every
day
but
just
think
with
what
uneasy
compassion
morley
would
regard
our
poor
ambitions
even
if
you
had
an
occasional
cook
and
an
undertaker
man
and
what
would
he
do
without
his
glass
of
dry
sherry
after
his
soup
and
his
hock
and
champagne
later
not
to
mention
his
fine
claret
or
tawny
port
afterwards
i
do
know
how
to
get
these
things
good
enough
for
him
without
laying
in
a
stock
and
that
you
know
would
be
as
absurd
as
it
is
impossible
oh
you
gentlemen
always
think
so
much
of
the
wine
believe
me
it
is
as
necessary
to
morley
comfort
as
the
dainties
you
would
provide
him
with
indeed
it
would
be
a
cruelty
to
ask
him
he
would
not
could
not
enjoy
it
if
he
did
like
it
he
need
come
again
i
said
cross
with
the
objections
of
which
i
could
not
but
see
the
justice
well
i
must
say
you
have
an
odd
notion
of
hospitality
said
my
bear
you
may
be
certain
he
resumed
after
a
moment
pause
that
a
man
so
well
aware
of
his
own
importance
will
take
it
far
more
as
a
compliment
that
you
do
not
presume
to
invite
him
to
your
house
but
are
content
to
enjoy
his
society
when
he
asks
you
to
his
i
do
choose
to
take
such
an
inferior
position
i
said
you
ca
help
it
my
dear
he
returned
socially
considered
you
his
inferior
you
can
not
give
dinners
he
would
regard
with
any
thing
better
than
a
friendly
contempt
combined
with
a
certain
mild
indignation
at
your
having
presumed
to
ask
used
to
such
different
ways
it
is
far
more
graceful
to
accept
the
small
fact
and
let
him
have
his
whim
which
is
not
a
subversive
one
or
at
all
dangerous
to
the
community
being
of
a
sort
easy
to
cure
ha
ha
ha
may
i
ask
what
you
are
laughing
at
i
said
with
severity
i
was
only
fancying
how
such
a
man
must
feel
if
what
your
blessed
father
believes
be
true
when
he
is
stripped
all
at
once
of
every
possible
source
of
consequence
stripped
of
position
funds
house
including
cellar
clothes
body
including
stomach
there
there
do
be
vulgar
it
is
not
like
you
percivale
my
love
there
is
far
greater
vulgarity
in
refusing
to
acknowledge
the
inevitable
either
in
society
or
in
physiology
just
ask
my
brother
his
experience
in
regard
of
the
word
to
which
you
object
i
will
leave
that
to
you
do
be
vexed
with
me
my
wife
he
said
i
do
like
not
to
be
allowed
to
pay
my
debts
back
to
the
like
a
hunted
hare
a
woman
way
he
said
merrily
hoping
to
make
me
laugh
for
he
could
not
doubt
i
should
see
the
absurdity
of
my
position
with
a
moment
reflection
but
i
was
out
of
temper
and
chose
to
pounce
upon
the
liberty
taken
with
my
sex
and
regard
it
as
an
insult
without
a
word
i
rose
pressed
my
baby
to
my
bosom
as
if
her
mother
had
been
left
a
widow
and
swept
away
percivale
started
to
his
feet
i
did
not
see
but
i
knew
he
gazed
after
me
for
a
moment
then
i
heard
him
sit
down
to
his
painting
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
i
knew
with
a
sharp
pain
inside
his
great
chest
for
me
i
found
the
precipice
or
jacob
ladder
i
had
to
climb
very
subversive
of
my
dignity
for
when
a
woman
has
to
hold
a
baby
in
one
arm
and
with
the
hand
of
the
other
lift
the
front
of
her
skirt
in
order
to
walk
up
an
almost
perpendicular
staircase
it
is
quite
impossible
for
her
to
any
more
when
i
reached
the
top
i
do
know
how
it
was
but
the
picture
he
had
made
of
me
with
the
coming
through
the
window
flashed
upon
my
memory
all
dignity
forgotten
i
bolted
through
the
door
at
the
top
flung
my
baby
into
the
arms
of
her
nurse
turned
almost
tumbled
headlong
down
the
precipice
and
altogether
tumbled
down
at
my
husband
chair
i
could
speak
i
could
only
lay
my
head
on
his
knees
darling
he
said
you
shall
ask
the
great
pan
jan
with
his
button
atop
if
you
like
i
do
my
best
for
him
between
crying
and
laughing
i
nearly
did
what
i
have
never
really
done
yet
i
nearly
there
i
am
sure
that
phrase
is
quite
as
objectionable
as
the
word
i
wrote
a
little
while
ago
and
there
it
shall
stand
as
a
penance
for
having
called
any
word
my
husband
used
i
was
very
naughty
percivale
i
said
i
will
give
a
and
it
shall
be
such
as
you
shall
enjoy
and
i
wo
ask
mr
morley
thank
you
my
love
he
said
and
the
next
time
morley
asks
us
i
will
go
without
a
grumble
and
make
myself
as
agreeable
as
i
can
it
may
have
seemed
to
some
of
my
readers
occasion
for
surprise
that
the
mistress
of
a
household
should
have
got
so
far
in
the
construction
of
a
book
without
saying
a
word
about
her
own
or
other
people
servants
in
general
such
occasion
shall
no
longer
be
afforded
them
for
now
i
am
going
to
say
several
things
about
one
of
mine
and
thereby
introduce
a
few
results
of
much
experience
and
some
thought
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
made
a
single
discovery
but
only
to
have
achieved
what
i
count
a
certain
measure
of
success
which
however
i
owe
largely
to
my
own
poverty
and
the
stupidity
of
my
cook
i
have
had
a
good
many
servants
since
but
jemima
seems
a
fixture
how
this
has
come
about
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
in
ever
so
many
words
over
and
over
i
have
felt
and
may
feel
again
before
the
day
is
ended
a
profound
sympathy
with
sindbad
the
sailor
when
the
old
man
of
the
sea
was
on
his
back
and
the
hope
of
ever
getting
him
off
it
had
not
yet
begun
to
dawn
she
has
by
turns
every
fault
under
the
sun
i
say
only
will
struggle
with
one
for
a
day
and
succumb
to
it
for
a
month
while
the
smallest
amount
of
praise
is
sufficient
to
render
her
incapable
of
deserving
a
word
of
commendation
for
a
week
she
is
intensely
stupid
with
a
remarkable
genius
yes
genius
for
cooking
my
father
says
that
all
stupidity
is
caused
or
at
least
maintained
by
conceit
i
can
not
quite
accompany
him
to
his
conclusions
but
i
have
seen
plainly
enough
that
the
stupidest
people
are
the
most
conceited
which
in
some
degree
favors
them
it
was
long
an
impossibility
to
make
her
see
or
at
least
own
that
she
was
to
blame
for
any
thing
if
the
dish
she
had
last
time
cooked
to
perfection
made
its
appearance
the
next
time
uneatable
she
would
lay
it
all
to
the
oven
which
was
too
hot
or
too
cold
or
the
silly
the
top
of
which
fell
off
as
she
was
using
it
she
had
no
sense
of
the
value
of
proportion
would
insist
for
instance
that
she
had
made
the
cake
precisely
as
she
had
been
told
but
suddenly
betray
that
she
had
not
weighed
the
flour
which
be
of
no
consequence
seeing
she
had
weighed
every
thing
else
please
could
you
eat
your
dinner
now
for
it
all
ready
she
came
saying
an
hour
before
the
very
first
day
after
my
mother
left
even
now
her
desire
to
be
punctual
is
chiefly
evidenced
by
absurd
precipitancy
to
the
danger
of
doing
every
thing
either
to
a
pulp
or
a
cinder
yet
here
she
is
and
here
she
is
likely
to
remain
so
far
as
i
see
till
death
or
some
other
catastrophe
us
do
part
the
reason
of
it
is
that
with
all
her
faults
and
they
are
innumerable
she
has
some
heart
yes
after
deducting
all
that
can
be
laid
to
the
account
of
a
certain
cunning
perception
that
she
is
well
off
she
has
yet
a
good
deal
of
genuine
attachment
left
and
after
setting
down
the
half
of
her
possessions
to
the
blarney
which
is
the
natural
weapon
of
the
celt
there
seems
yet
left
in
her
of
the
vanishing
clan
instinct
enough
to
render
her
a
jealous
partisan
of
her
master
and
mistress
those
who
care
only
for
being
will
of
course
feel
contemptuous
towards
any
one
who
would
put
up
with
such
a
woman
for
a
single
moment
after
she
could
find
another
but
both
i
and
my
husband
have
a
strong
preference
for
living
in
a
family
rather
than
in
a
hotel
i
know
many
houses
in
which
the
master
and
mistress
are
far
more
like
the
lodgers
on
sufferance
of
their
own
servants
i
have
seen
a
worthy
lady
go
about
wringing
her
hands
because
she
could
not
get
her
orders
attended
to
in
the
emergency
of
a
slight
accident
not
daring
to
go
down
to
her
own
kitchen
as
her
love
prompted
and
expedite
the
ministration
i
am
at
least
mistress
in
my
own
house
my
servants
are
if
not
yet
so
much
members
of
the
family
as
i
could
wish
gradually
becoming
more
so
there
is
a
circulation
of
common
life
through
the
household
rendering
us
an
organization
although
as
yet
perhaps
a
low
one
i
am
sure
of
being
obeyed
and
there
are
no
underhand
connections
when
i
go
to
the
houses
of
my
rich
relations
and
hear
what
they
say
concerning
their
servants
i
feel
as
if
they
were
living
over
a
mine
which
might
any
day
be
sprung
and
blow
them
into
a
state
of
utter
helplessness
and
i
return
to
my
house
blessed
in
the
knowledge
that
my
little
kingdom
is
my
own
and
that
although
it
is
not
free
from
internal
upheavings
and
stormy
commotions
these
are
such
as
to
be
within
the
control
and
restraint
of
the
general
family
influences
while
the
blunders
of
the
cook
seem
such
trifles
beside
the
evil
customs
established
in
most
kitchens
of
which
i
know
any
thing
that
they
are
turned
even
into
sources
of
congratulation
as
securing
her
services
for
ourselves
more
than
once
my
husband
has
insisted
on
raising
her
wages
on
the
ground
of
the
endless
good
he
gets
in
his
painting
from
the
merriment
her
oddities
afford
him
namely
the
clear
insight
which
he
asserts
is
the
invariable
consequence
i
must
in
honesty
say
however
that
i
have
seen
him
something
else
than
merry
with
her
behavior
many
a
time
but
i
find
the
things
i
have
to
say
so
crowd
upon
me
that
i
must
either
proceed
to
arrange
them
under
heads
which
would
immediately
deprive
them
of
any
right
to
a
place
in
my
story
or
keep
them
till
they
are
naturally
swept
from
the
bank
of
my
material
by
the
slow
wearing
of
the
current
of
my
narrative
i
prefer
the
latter
because
i
think
my
readers
will
what
with
one
thing
and
another
this
thing
to
be
done
and
that
thing
to
be
avoided
there
was
nothing
more
said
about
the
until
my
father
came
to
see
us
in
the
month
of
july
i
was
to
have
paid
them
a
visit
before
then
but
things
had
come
in
the
way
of
that
also
and
now
my
father
was
commissioned
by
my
mother
to
arrange
for
my
going
the
next
month
as
soon
as
i
had
shown
my
father
to
his
little
room
i
ran
down
to
percivale
papa
is
come
i
said
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
he
answered
laying
down
his
palette
and
brushes
where
is
he
gone
up
stairs
i
answered
i
would
disturb
you
till
he
came
down
again
he
answered
with
that
english
phrase
so
suggestive
of
a
hopeful
disposition
all
right
and
with
all
its
grumbling
and
the
which
the
french
consider
its
chief
characteristic
i
think
my
father
is
right
who
says
that
more
than
any
other
nation
england
has
been
is
and
will
be
saved
by
hope
resuming
his
implements
my
husband
added
i
have
quite
finished
my
pipe
i
will
go
on
till
he
comes
down
although
he
laid
it
on
his
pipe
i
knew
well
enough
it
was
just
that
little
bit
of
paint
he
wanted
to
finish
and
not
the
residue
of
tobacco
in
the
black
and
red
bowl
and
now
we
have
our
dinner
party
i
said
i
do
believe
that
for
all
the
nonsense
i
had
talked
about
returning
invitations
the
real
thing
at
my
heart
even
then
was
an
impulse
towards
hospitable
entertainment
and
the
desire
to
see
my
husband
merry
with
his
friends
under
shall
i
say
it
the
protecting
wing
of
his
wife
for
as
mother
of
the
family
the
wife
has
to
mother
her
husband
also
to
consider
him
as
her
and
look
out
for
what
will
not
only
give
him
pleasure
but
be
good
for
him
and
i
may
just
add
here
that
for
a
long
time
my
bear
has
fully
given
in
to
this
and
who
are
you
going
to
ask
he
said
and
morley
to
begin
with
and
no
no
i
answered
we
are
going
to
have
a
jolly
evening
of
it
with
nobody
present
who
will
make
you
either
anxious
or
annoyed
blackstone
he
was
married
then
miss
clare
i
think
and
what
do
you
ask
her
for
i
wo
if
you
do
like
her
but
i
have
had
a
chance
of
liking
or
disliking
her
yet
that
is
partly
why
i
want
to
ask
her
i
am
so
sure
you
would
like
her
if
you
knew
her
where
did
you
tell
me
you
had
met
her
at
cousin
judy
i
must
have
one
lady
to
keep
me
in
countenance
with
so
many
gentlemen
you
know
i
have
another
reason
for
asking
her
which
i
would
rather
you
should
find
out
than
i
tell
you
do
you
mind
not
in
the
least
if
you
do
think
she
will
spoil
the
fun
i
am
sure
she
wo
then
there
your
brother
roger
of
course
who
more
i
think
that
will
do
there
will
be
six
of
us
then
quite
a
large
enough
party
for
our
little
why
should
we
dine
here
it
would
be
so
hot
and
we
should
have
more
room
i
liked
the
idea
the
night
before
percivale
arranged
every
thing
so
that
not
only
his
paintings
of
which
he
had
far
too
many
and
which
were
huddled
about
the
room
but
all
his
as
well
should
be
accessory
to
a
picturesque
effect
and
when
the
table
was
covered
with
the
glass
and
plate
of
which
latter
my
mother
had
taken
care
i
should
not
be
destitute
and
adorned
with
the
flowers
which
roger
brought
me
from
covent
garden
assisted
by
a
few
of
our
own
i
thought
the
view
from
the
top
of
jacob
ladder
a
very
pretty
one
indeed
resolved
that
percivale
should
have
no
cause
of
complaint
as
regarded
the
simplicity
of
my
arrangements
i
gave
orders
that
our
little
ethel
who
at
that
time
of
the
evening
was
always
asleep
should
be
laid
on
the
couch
in
my
room
off
the
study
with
the
door
ajar
so
that
sarah
who
was
now
her
nurse
might
wait
with
an
easy
mind
the
dinner
was
brought
in
by
the
outer
door
of
the
study
to
avoid
the
awkwardness
and
possible
disaster
of
the
private
precipice
the
principal
dish
a
small
sirloin
of
beef
was
at
the
foot
of
the
table
and
a
couple
of
boiled
fowls
as
i
thought
before
me
but
when
the
covers
were
removed
to
my
surprise
i
found
they
were
roasted
what
have
you
got
there
percivale
i
asked
is
it
sirloin
i
not
an
adept
in
such
matters
he
replied
i
should
say
it
was
my
father
gave
a
glance
at
the
joint
something
seemed
to
be
wrong
i
rose
and
went
to
my
husband
side
powers
of
cuisine
jemima
had
roasted
the
fowls
and
boiled
the
sirloin
my
exclamation
was
the
signal
for
an
outbreak
of
laughter
led
by
my
father
i
was
trembling
in
the
balance
between
mortification
on
my
own
account
and
sympathy
with
the
evident
amusement
of
my
father
and
blackstone
but
the
thought
that
morley
might
have
been
and
was
not
of
the
party
came
with
such
a
pang
and
such
a
relief
that
it
settled
the
point
and
i
burst
out
laughing
i
dare
say
it
all
right
said
roger
why
should
a
sirloin
be
boiled
as
well
as
roasted
i
venture
to
assert
that
it
is
all
a
whim
and
we
are
on
the
verge
of
a
new
discovery
to
swell
the
number
of
those
which
already
owe
their
being
to
blunders
let
us
all
try
a
slice
then
said
blackstone
and
compare
results
this
was
agreed
to
and
a
solemn
silence
followed
during
which
each
sought
acquaintance
with
the
new
dish
i
am
sorry
to
say
remarked
my
father
speaking
first
that
roger
is
all
wrong
and
we
have
only
made
the
discovery
that
custom
is
right
it
is
plain
enough
why
sirloin
is
always
roasted
i
yield
myself
convinced
said
roger
and
i
am
certain
said
blackstone
that
if
the
loin
set
before
the
king
whoever
he
was
had
been
boiled
he
would
never
have
knighted
it
thanks
to
the
loin
the
last
possible
touch
of
constraint
had
vanished
and
the
party
grew
a
very
merry
one
the
which
followed
was
declared
perfect
and
eaten
up
percivale
produced
some
good
wine
from
somewhere
which
evidently
added
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
gentlemen
my
father
included
who
likes
a
good
glass
of
wine
as
well
as
anybody
but
a
tiny
little
whimper
called
me
away
and
miss
clare
accompanied
me
the
gentlemen
insisting
that
we
should
return
as
soon
as
possible
and
bring
the
homuncle
as
roger
called
the
baby
with
us
when
we
returned
the
two
clergymen
were
in
close
conversation
and
the
other
two
gentlemen
were
chiefly
listening
my
father
was
saying
my
dear
sir
i
do
see
how
any
man
can
do
his
duty
as
a
clergyman
who
does
visit
his
parishioners
in
london
it
is
simply
impossible
returned
blackstone
in
the
country
you
are
welcome
wherever
you
go
any
visit
i
might
pay
would
most
likely
be
regarded
either
as
an
intrusion
or
as
giving
the
right
to
pecuniary
aid
of
which
evils
the
latter
is
the
worse
there
are
portions
of
every
london
parish
which
clergymen
and
their
coadjutors
have
so
degraded
by
the
practical
teaching
of
beggary
that
they
have
blocked
up
every
door
to
a
healthy
spiritual
relation
between
them
and
pastor
possible
would
you
not
give
alms
at
all
then
one
thing
at
least
i
have
made
up
my
mind
upon
that
alms
from
any
but
the
hand
of
personal
friendship
tend
to
evil
and
will
in
the
long
run
increase
misery
what
then
do
you
suppose
the
proper
relation
between
a
london
clergyman
and
his
parishioners
one
i
am
afraid
which
does
not
at
present
exist
one
which
it
is
his
first
business
perhaps
to
bring
about
i
confess
i
regard
with
a
repulsion
amounting
to
horror
the
idea
of
walking
into
a
poor
man
house
except
either
i
have
business
with
him
or
desire
his
personal
acquaintance
but
if
our
office
makes
it
my
business
to
serve
not
to
assume
authority
over
them
especially
to
the
degree
of
forcing
service
upon
them
i
will
not
say
how
far
intimacy
may
not
justify
you
in
immediate
assault
upon
a
conscience
but
i
shrink
from
any
plan
that
seems
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
poor
are
more
wicked
than
the
rich
why
do
we
send
missionaries
to
belgravia
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
may
sometimes
be
dirtier
than
the
inside
your
missionary
could
hardly
force
his
way
through
the
servants
to
the
boudoir
or
and
the
poor
have
no
servants
to
defend
them
i
have
recorded
this
much
of
the
conversation
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
introducing
miss
clare
who
now
spoke
do
you
think
sir
she
asked
addressing
my
father
that
the
help
one
can
give
to
another
must
always
depend
on
the
measure
in
which
one
is
free
one
self
my
father
was
silent
thinking
we
were
all
silent
i
said
to
myself
there
papa
that
is
something
after
your
own
heart
with
marked
deference
and
solemnity
he
answered
at
length
i
have
little
doubt
you
are
right
miss
clare
that
puts
the
question
upon
its
own
eternal
foundation
the
mode
used
must
be
of
infinitely
less
importance
than
the
person
who
uses
it
as
he
spoke
he
looked
at
her
with
a
far
more
attentive
regard
than
hitherto
indeed
the
eyes
of
all
the
company
seemed
to
be
scanning
the
small
woman
but
she
bore
the
scrutiny
well
if
indeed
she
was
not
unconscious
of
it
and
my
husband
began
to
find
out
one
of
my
reasons
for
asking
her
which
was
simply
that
he
might
see
her
face
at
this
moment
it
was
in
one
of
its
higher
phases
it
was
at
its
best
a
grand
face
at
its
worst
a
suffering
face
a
little
too
large
perhaps
for
the
small
body
which
it
crowned
with
a
flame
of
soul
but
while
you
saw
her
face
you
never
thought
of
the
rest
of
her
and
her
attire
seemed
to
court
an
escape
from
all
observation
but
my
father
went
on
looking
at
blackstone
i
am
anxious
from
the
clergyman
point
of
view
to
know
what
my
friend
here
thinks
he
must
try
to
do
in
his
very
difficult
position
i
think
the
best
thing
i
could
do
returned
blackstone
laughing
would
be
to
go
to
school
to
miss
clare
i
should
wonder
my
father
responded
but
in
the
mean
time
i
should
prefer
the
chaplaincy
of
a
suburban
cemetery
certainly
your
charge
would
be
a
less
troublesome
one
your
congregation
would
be
quiet
enough
at
least
said
roger
are
they
glad
because
they
be
quiet
said
my
father
as
if
unconsciously
uttering
his
own
reflections
but
he
was
a
little
cunning
and
would
say
things
like
that
when
fearful
of
irreverence
he
wanted
to
turn
the
current
of
the
conversation
but
surely
said
miss
clare
a
more
active
congregation
would
be
quite
as
desirable
she
had
one
fault
no
defect
she
was
slow
to
enter
into
the
humor
of
a
thing
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
first
aspect
of
any
bit
of
fun
presented
to
her
was
that
of
something
wrong
a
moment
reflection
however
almost
always
ended
in
a
sunny
laugh
partly
at
her
own
stupidity
as
she
called
it
you
mistake
my
meaning
said
blackstone
my
chief
almost
sole
attraction
to
the
regions
of
the
grave
is
the
sexton
and
not
the
placidity
of
the
inhabitants
though
perhaps
miss
clare
might
value
that
more
highly
if
she
had
more
experience
of
how
noisy
human
nature
can
be
miss
clare
gave
a
little
smile
which
enabled
me
to
interpret
as
meaning
perhaps
i
do
know
a
trifle
about
it
but
she
said
nothing
my
first
inquiry
he
went
on
before
accepting
such
an
appointment
would
be
as
to
the
character
and
mental
habits
of
the
sexton
if
i
found
him
a
man
capable
of
regarding
human
nature
from
a
of
his
own
i
should
close
with
the
offer
at
once
if
on
the
contrary
he
was
a
man
who
made
faultless
responses
and
cherished
the
friendship
of
the
undertaker
i
should
decline
in
fact
i
should
regard
the
sexton
as
my
proposed
master
and
whether
i
should
accept
the
place
or
not
would
depend
altogether
on
whether
i
liked
him
or
not
think
what
revelations
of
human
nature
a
real
man
in
such
a
position
could
give
me
me
the
shovel
you
stop
a
bit
you
out
of
breath
sit
down
on
that
stone
there
and
light
your
pipe
here
some
tobacco
now
tell
me
the
rest
of
the
story
how
did
the
old
fellow
get
on
after
he
had
buried
his
termagant
wife
that
how
i
should
treat
him
and
i
should
get
in
return
such
a
succession
of
peeps
into
human
life
and
intent
and
aspirations
as
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
would
send
me
to
the
next
vicarage
that
turned
up
a
sadder
and
wiser
man
mr
walton
i
do
doubt
it
said
my
father
but
whether
in
sympathy
with
blackstone
or
in
latent
disapproval
of
a
tone
judged
unbecoming
to
a
clergyman
i
can
not
tell
sometimes
i
confess
i
could
not
help
suspecting
the
source
of
the
deficiency
in
humor
which
he
often
complained
of
in
me
but
i
always
came
to
the
conclusion
that
what
seemed
such
a
deficiency
in
him
was
only
occasioned
by
the
presence
of
a
deeper
feeling
miss
clare
was
the
first
to
leave
what
a
lovely
countenance
that
is
said
my
husband
the
moment
she
was
out
of
hearing
she
is
a
very
remarkable
woman
said
my
father
i
suspect
she
knows
a
good
deal
more
than
most
of
us
said
blackstone
did
you
see
how
her
face
lighted
up
always
before
she
said
any
thing
you
can
never
come
nearer
to
seeing
a
thought
than
in
her
face
just
before
she
speaks
what
is
she
asked
roger
ca
you
see
what
she
is
returned
his
brother
she
a
saint
saint
clare
if
you
had
been
a
scotchman
now
said
roger
that
fine
name
would
have
sunk
to
in
your
mouth
not
a
more
vulgar
corruption
however
than
is
common
in
the
mouths
of
english
lords
and
ladies
when
they
turn
into
reminding
one
of
nothing
but
the
french
for
an
ape
said
my
father
but
what
does
she
do
persisted
roger
why
should
you
think
she
does
any
thing
i
asked
she
looks
as
if
she
had
to
earn
her
own
living
she
does
she
teaches
music
why
did
you
ask
her
to
play
because
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
been
to
the
house
does
she
go
to
church
do
you
suppose
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
why
do
you
ask
because
she
looks
as
if
she
did
want
it
i
never
saw
such
an
angelic
expression
upon
a
countenance
you
must
take
me
to
call
upon
her
said
my
father
i
will
with
pleasure
i
answered
i
found
however
that
this
was
easier
promised
than
performed
for
i
had
asked
her
by
word
of
mouth
at
cousin
judy
and
had
not
the
slightest
idea
where
she
lived
of
course
i
applied
to
judy
but
she
had
mislaid
her
address
and
promising
to
ask
her
for
it
forgot
more
than
once
my
father
had
to
return
home
without
seeing
her
again
chapter
xiv
a
picture
things
went
on
very
quietly
for
some
time
of
course
i
was
fully
occupied
as
well
i
might
be
with
a
life
to
tend
and
cultivate
which
must
blossom
at
length
into
the
human
flowers
of
love
and
obedience
and
faith
the
smallest
service
i
did
the
wonderful
thing
that
lay
in
my
lap
seemed
a
something
in
itself
so
well
worth
doing
that
it
was
worth
living
to
do
it
as
i
gazed
on
the
new
creation
so
far
beyond
my
understanding
yet
so
dependent
upon
me
while
asserting
an
absolute
and
divine
right
to
all
i
did
for
her
i
marvelled
that
god
should
intrust
me
with
such
a
charge
that
he
did
not
keep
the
lovely
creature
in
his
own
arms
and
refuse
her
to
any
others
then
i
would
bethink
myself
that
in
giving
her
into
mine
he
had
not
sent
her
out
of
his
own
for
i
too
was
a
child
in
his
arms
holding
and
tending
my
live
doll
until
it
should
grow
something
like
me
only
ever
so
much
better
was
she
not
given
to
me
that
she
might
learn
what
i
had
begun
to
learn
namely
that
a
willing
childhood
was
the
flower
of
life
how
can
any
mother
sit
with
her
child
on
her
lap
and
not
know
that
there
is
a
god
over
all
know
it
by
the
rising
of
her
own
heart
in
prayer
to
him
but
so
few
have
had
parents
like
mine
if
my
mother
felt
thus
when
i
lay
in
her
arms
it
was
no
wonder
i
should
feel
thus
when
my
child
lay
in
mine
before
i
had
children
of
my
own
i
did
not
care
about
children
and
therefore
did
not
understand
them
but
i
had
read
somewhere
and
it
clung
to
me
although
i
did
not
understand
it
that
it
was
in
laying
hold
of
the
heart
of
his
mother
that
jesus
laid
his
first
hold
on
the
world
to
redeem
it
and
now
at
length
i
began
to
understand
it
what
a
divine
way
of
saving
us
it
was
to
let
her
bear
him
carry
him
in
her
bosom
wash
him
and
dress
him
and
nurse
him
and
sing
him
to
sleep
offer
him
the
adoration
of
mother
love
misunderstand
him
chide
him
forgive
him
even
for
fancied
wrong
such
a
love
might
well
save
a
world
in
which
were
mothers
enough
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
ye
shall
no
more
offer
vain
sacrifices
to
one
who
needs
them
not
and
can
not
use
them
i
will
need
them
so
require
them
at
your
hands
i
will
hunger
and
thirst
and
be
naked
and
cold
and
ye
shall
minister
to
me
sacrifice
shall
be
no
more
a
symbol
but
a
real
giving
unto
god
and
when
i
return
to
the
father
inasmuch
as
ye
do
it
to
one
of
the
least
of
these
ye
do
it
unto
me
so
all
the
world
is
henceforth
the
temple
of
god
its
worship
is
ministration
the
commonest
service
is
divine
service
i
feared
at
first
that
the
new
strange
love
i
felt
in
my
heart
came
only
of
the
fact
that
the
child
was
percivale
and
mine
but
i
soon
found
it
had
a
far
deeper
source
that
it
sprung
from
the
very
humanity
of
the
infant
woman
yea
from
her
relation
in
virtue
of
that
humanity
to
the
father
of
all
the
fountain
in
my
heart
it
arose
from
an
infinite
store
in
the
unseen
soon
however
came
jealousy
of
my
love
for
my
baby
i
feared
lest
it
should
make
me
nay
was
making
me
neglect
my
husband
the
fear
first
arose
in
me
one
morning
as
i
sat
with
her
half
dressed
on
my
knees
i
was
dawdling
over
her
in
my
fondness
as
i
used
to
dawdle
over
the
dressing
of
my
doll
when
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
never
once
since
her
arrival
had
i
sat
with
my
husband
in
his
study
a
pang
of
dismay
shot
through
me
is
this
to
be
a
wife
i
said
to
myself
to
play
with
a
live
love
like
a
dead
doll
and
forget
her
husband
i
caught
up
a
blanket
from
the
cradle
i
am
not
going
to
throw
away
that
good
old
word
for
the
ugly
outlandish
name
they
give
it
now
reminding
one
only
of
a
helmet
i
caught
up
a
blanket
from
the
cradle
i
say
wrapped
it
round
the
treasure
which
was
shooting
its
arms
and
legs
in
every
direction
like
a
polypus
feeling
after
its
food
and
rushed
down
stairs
and
down
the
precipice
into
the
study
percivale
started
up
in
terror
thinking
something
fearful
had
happened
and
i
was
bringing
him
all
that
was
left
of
the
child
what
what
what
the
matter
he
gasped
i
could
not
while
he
was
thus
frightened
explain
to
him
what
had
driven
me
to
him
in
such
alarming
haste
i
brought
you
the
baby
to
kiss
i
said
unfolding
the
blanket
and
holding
up
the
sprawling
little
goddess
towards
the
face
that
towered
above
me
was
it
dying
for
a
kiss
then
he
said
taking
her
blanket
and
all
from
my
arms
the
end
of
the
blanket
swept
across
his
easel
and
smeared
the
face
of
the
baby
in
a
picture
of
the
at
which
he
was
working
o
percivale
i
cried
you
smeared
your
baby
but
this
is
a
real
live
baby
she
may
smear
any
thing
she
likes
except
her
own
face
and
hands
please
then
percivale
or
her
blessed
frock
said
percivale
she
has
got
one
though
why
has
the
little
angel
got
her
feathers
on
yet
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
bring
her
to
be
kissed
no
not
exactly
it
was
her
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
bring
it
was
myself
ah
you
wanted
to
be
kissed
did
you
no
sir
i
did
want
to
be
kissed
but
i
did
so
want
to
kiss
you
percivale
is
it
all
the
same
though
darling
he
said
it
seems
so
to
me
sometimes
percivale
you
are
so
very
stupid
it
not
the
same
at
all
there
a
world
of
difference
between
the
two
and
you
ought
to
know
it
or
be
told
it
if
you
do
i
shall
think
it
over
as
soon
as
you
leave
me
he
said
but
i
not
going
to
leave
you
for
a
long
time
i
have
seen
you
paint
for
weeks
and
weeks
not
since
this
little
troublesome
thing
came
poking
in
between
us
but
she
not
dressed
yet
that
does
signify
she
well
wrapped
up
and
quite
warm
he
put
me
a
chair
where
i
could
see
his
picture
without
catching
the
shine
of
the
paint
i
took
the
baby
from
him
and
he
went
on
with
his
work
you
do
think
i
am
going
to
sacrifice
all
my
privileges
to
this
little
tyrant
do
you
i
said
it
would
be
rather
hard
for
me
at
least
he
rejoined
you
did
think
i
was
neglecting
you
then
percivale
not
for
a
moment
then
you
did
miss
me
i
did
very
much
and
you
did
grumble
no
do
i
disturb
you
i
asked
after
a
little
pause
can
you
paint
just
as
well
when
i
am
here
as
when
you
are
alone
better
i
feel
warmer
to
my
work
somehow
i
was
satisfied
and
held
my
peace
when
i
am
best
pleased
i
do
want
to
talk
but
percivale
perhaps
not
having
found
this
out
yet
looked
anxiously
in
my
face
and
as
at
the
moment
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
picture
i
thought
he
wanted
to
find
out
whether
i
liked
the
design
i
see
it
now
i
cried
i
could
not
make
out
where
the
magi
were
he
had
taken
for
the
scene
of
his
picture
an
old
farm
kitchen
or
hall
with
its
rich
brown
rafters
its
fire
on
the
hearth
and
its
red
brick
floor
a
tub
half
full
of
bright
water
stood
on
one
side
and
the
mother
was
bending
over
her
baby
which
undressed
for
the
bath
she
was
holding
out
for
the
admiration
of
the
magi
immediately
behind
the
mother
stood
in
the
garb
of
a
shepherd
my
father
leaning
on
the
ordinary
shepherd
crook
my
mother
like
a
in
her
with
a
white
handkerchief
crossed
upon
her
bosom
stood
beside
him
and
both
were
gazing
with
a
chastened
yet
profound
pleasure
on
the
lovely
child
in
front
stood
two
boys
and
a
girl
between
the
ages
of
five
and
nine
gazing
each
with
a
peculiar
wondering
delight
on
the
baby
the
youngest
boy
with
a
great
spotted
wooden
horse
in
his
hand
was
approaching
to
embrace
the
infant
in
such
fashion
as
made
the
toy
look
dangerous
and
the
left
hand
of
the
mother
was
lifted
with
a
motion
of
warning
and
defence
the
little
girl
the
next
youngest
had
in
her
absorption
dropped
her
gaudily
dressed
doll
at
her
feet
and
stood
sucking
her
thumb
her
big
blue
eyes
wide
with
contemplation
the
eldest
boy
had
brought
his
white
rabbit
to
give
the
baby
but
had
forgotten
all
about
it
so
full
was
his
heart
of
his
new
brother
an
expression
of
mingled
love
and
wonder
and
perplexity
had
already
begun
to
dawn
upon
the
face
but
it
was
as
yet
far
from
finished
he
stood
behind
the
other
two
peeping
over
their
heads
were
you
thinking
of
that
titian
in
the
louvre
with
the
white
rabbit
in
it
i
asked
percivale
i
did
not
think
of
it
until
after
i
had
put
in
the
rabbit
he
replied
and
it
shall
remain
for
it
suits
my
purpose
and
titian
would
not
claim
all
the
white
rabbits
because
of
that
one
did
you
think
of
the
black
lamb
in
it
then
when
you
laid
that
black
pussy
on
the
hearth
i
asked
black
lamb
he
returned
yes
i
insisted
a
black
lamb
in
the
dark
background
such
a
very
black
lamb
and
in
such
a
dark
background
that
it
seems
you
never
discovered
it
are
you
sure
he
persisted
absolutely
certain
i
replied
i
pointed
it
out
to
papa
in
the
picture
itself
in
the
louvre
he
had
not
observed
it
before
either
i
am
very
glad
to
know
there
is
such
a
thing
there
i
need
not
answer
your
question
you
see
it
is
odd
enough
i
should
have
put
in
the
black
puss
upon
some
grounds
i
might
argue
that
my
puss
is
better
than
titian
lamb
what
grounds
tell
me
if
the
painter
wanted
a
contrast
a
lamb
be
he
as
black
as
ever
paint
could
make
him
must
still
be
a
more
christian
animal
than
a
cat
as
white
as
snow
under
what
pretence
could
a
cat
be
used
for
a
christian
symbol
what
do
you
make
of
her
playfulness
i
should
count
that
a
virtue
were
it
not
for
the
fatal
objection
that
it
is
always
exercised
at
the
expense
of
other
creatures
a
ball
of
string
or
a
reel
or
a
bit
of
paper
is
enough
for
an
uncorrupted
kitten
but
you
must
not
forget
that
it
serves
only
in
virtue
of
the
imagination
representing
it
as
alive
if
you
do
not
make
it
move
she
will
herself
set
it
in
motion
as
the
initiative
of
the
game
if
she
can
not
do
that
she
will
take
no
notice
of
it
yes
i
see
i
give
in
all
this
time
he
had
been
painting
diligently
he
could
now
combine
talking
and
painting
far
better
than
he
used
but
a
knock
came
to
the
study
door
and
remembering
baby
unpresentable
condition
i
huddled
her
up
climbed
the
stair
again
and
finished
the
fledging
of
my
little
angel
in
a
very
happy
frame
of
mind
chapter
xv
rumors
hardly
was
it
completed
when
cousin
judy
called
and
i
went
down
to
see
her
carrying
my
baby
with
me
as
i
went
something
put
me
in
mind
that
i
must
ask
her
for
miss
clare
address
lest
i
should
again
forget
as
soon
as
she
had
kissed
and
admired
the
baby
i
said
have
you
found
out
yet
where
miss
clare
lives
judy
i
do
choose
to
find
out
she
answered
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
had
to
give
her
up
it
is
a
disappointment
i
confess
what
do
you
mean
i
said
i
thought
you
considered
her
a
very
good
teacher
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
her
on
that
score
she
was
always
punctual
and
i
must
allow
both
played
well
and
taught
the
children
delightfully
but
i
have
heard
such
questionable
things
about
her
very
strange
things
indeed
what
are
they
i
ca
say
i
been
able
to
fix
on
more
than
one
thing
directly
against
her
character
but
against
her
character
i
exclaimed
yes
indeed
she
lives
by
herself
in
lodgings
and
the
house
is
not
at
all
a
respectable
one
but
have
you
made
no
further
inquiry
i
consider
that
quite
enough
i
had
already
met
more
than
one
person
however
who
seemed
to
think
it
very
odd
that
i
should
have
her
to
teach
music
in
my
family
did
they
give
any
reason
for
thinking
her
unfit
i
did
not
choose
to
ask
them
one
was
miss
clarke
you
know
her
she
smiled
in
her
usual
supercilious
manner
but
in
her
case
i
believe
it
was
only
because
miss
clare
looks
so
dowdy
but
nobody
knows
any
thing
about
her
except
what
i
just
told
you
and
who
told
you
that
mrs
jeffreson
but
you
once
told
me
that
she
was
a
great
gossip
else
she
would
have
heard
it
but
that
does
make
it
untrue
in
fact
she
convinced
me
of
its
truth
for
she
knows
the
place
she
lives
in
and
assured
me
it
was
at
great
risk
of
infection
to
the
children
that
i
allowed
her
to
enter
the
house
and
so
of
course
i
felt
compelled
to
let
her
know
that
i
did
require
her
services
any
longer
there
must
be
some
mistake
surely
i
said
oh
no
not
the
least
i
am
sorry
to
say
how
did
she
take
it
very
sweetly
indeed
she
did
even
ask
me
why
which
was
just
as
well
seeing
i
should
have
found
it
awkward
to
tell
her
but
i
suppose
she
knew
too
many
grounds
herself
to
dare
the
question
i
was
dreadfully
sorry
but
i
could
not
say
much
more
then
i
ventured
only
to
express
my
conviction
that
there
could
not
be
any
charge
to
bring
against
miss
clare
herself
for
that
one
who
looked
and
spoke
as
she
did
could
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
judy
however
insisted
that
what
she
had
heard
was
reason
enough
for
at
least
ending
the
engagement
indeed
that
no
one
was
fit
for
such
a
situation
of
whom
such
things
could
be
said
whether
they
were
true
or
not
when
she
left
me
i
gave
baby
to
her
nurse
and
went
straight
to
the
study
peeping
in
to
see
if
percivale
was
alone
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
called
to
me
to
come
down
it
only
roger
he
said
i
was
always
pleased
to
see
roger
he
was
a
strange
creature
one
of
those
gifted
men
who
are
capable
of
any
thing
if
not
of
every
thing
and
yet
carry
nothing
within
sight
of
proficiency
he
whistled
like
a
starling
and
accompanied
his
whistling
on
the
piano
but
never
played
he
could
copy
a
drawing
to
a
but
never
drew
he
could
engrave
well
on
wood
but
although
he
had
often
been
employed
in
that
way
he
had
always
got
tired
of
it
after
a
few
weeks
he
was
forever
wanting
to
do
something
other
than
what
he
was
at
and
the
moment
he
got
tired
of
a
thing
he
would
work
at
it
no
longer
for
he
had
never
learned
to
himself
he
would
come
every
day
to
the
study
for
a
week
to
paint
in
backgrounds
or
make
a
duplicate
and
then
perhaps
we
would
see
him
for
a
fortnight
at
other
times
he
would
work
say
for
a
month
modelling
or
carving
marble
for
a
sculptor
friend
from
whom
he
might
have
had
constant
employment
if
he
had
pleased
he
had
given
lessons
in
various
branches
for
he
was
an
excellent
scholar
and
had
the
finest
ear
for
verse
as
well
as
the
keenest
appreciation
of
the
loveliness
of
poetry
that
i
have
ever
known
he
had
stuck
to
this
longer
than
to
any
thing
else
strange
to
say
for
one
would
have
thought
it
the
least
attractive
of
employments
to
one
of
his
volatile
disposition
for
some
time
indeed
he
had
supported
himself
comfortably
in
this
way
for
through
friends
of
his
family
he
had
had
good
introductions
and
although
he
wasted
a
good
deal
of
money
in
buying
that
promised
to
be
useful
and
seldom
were
he
had
no
objectionable
habits
except
inordinate
smoking
but
it
happened
that
a
pupil
a
girl
of
imaginative
disposition
i
presume
fell
so
much
in
love
with
him
that
she
betrayed
her
feelings
to
her
and
the
lessons
were
of
course
put
an
end
to
i
suspect
he
did
not
escape
himself
for
he
immediately
dropped
all
his
other
lessons
and
took
to
writing
poetry
for
a
new
magazine
which
proved
of
ephemeral
constitution
and
vanished
after
a
few
months
of
hectic
existence
it
was
remarkable
that
with
such
instability
his
moral
nature
should
continue
uncorrupted
but
this
i
believe
he
owed
chiefly
to
his
love
and
admiration
of
his
brother
for
my
part
i
could
not
help
liking
him
much
there
was
a
playfulness
about
him
alternated
with
gloom
and
occasionally
with
wild
merriment
which
made
him
interesting
even
when
one
felt
most
inclined
to
quarrel
with
him
the
worst
of
him
was
that
he
considered
himself
a
generally
misunderstood
if
not
man
who
could
not
only
distinguish
himself
but
render
valuable
service
to
society
if
only
society
would
do
him
the
justice
to
give
him
a
chance
were
it
only
however
for
his
love
to
my
baby
i
could
not
but
be
ready
to
take
up
his
defence
when
i
mentioned
what
i
had
just
heard
about
miss
clare
percivale
looked
both
astonished
and
troubled
but
before
he
could
speak
roger
with
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
world
whom
experience
enabled
to
come
at
once
to
a
decision
said
depend
upon
it
wynnie
there
is
falsehood
there
somewhere
you
will
always
be
nearer
the
truth
if
you
believe
nothing
than
if
you
believe
the
half
of
what
you
hear
that
very
much
what
papa
says
i
answered
he
affirms
that
he
never
searched
into
an
injurious
report
in
his
own
parish
without
finding
it
so
nearly
false
as
to
deprive
it
of
all
right
to
go
about
besides
said
roger
look
at
that
face
how
i
should
like
to
model
it
she
a
good
woman
that
depend
upon
it
i
was
delighted
with
his
enthusiasm
i
wish
you
would
ask
her
again
as
soon
as
you
can
said
percivale
who
always
tended
to
embody
his
conclusions
in
acts
rather
than
in
words
your
cousin
judy
is
a
jolly
good
creature
but
from
your
father
description
of
her
as
a
girl
she
must
have
grown
a
good
deal
more
worldly
since
her
marriage
respectability
is
an
awful
snare
yes
said
roger
one
ought
to
be
very
thankful
to
be
a
bohemian
and
have
nothing
expected
of
him
for
respectability
is
a
most
fruitful
mother
of
stupidity
and
injustice
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
might
however
have
a
little
more
and
be
none
the
worse
i
should
be
very
glad
to
do
as
you
desire
husband
i
said
but
how
can
i
i
have
learned
where
she
lives
it
was
asking
judy
for
her
address
once
more
that
brought
it
all
out
i
certainly
did
insist
as
i
might
have
done
notwithstanding
what
she
told
me
but
if
she
did
remember
it
before
you
may
be
sure
she
could
not
have
given
it
me
then
it
very
odd
said
roger
stroking
his
long
mustache
the
sole
ornament
of
the
kind
he
wore
it
very
odd
he
repeated
thoughtfully
and
then
paused
again
what
so
very
odd
roger
asked
percivale
the
other
evening
answered
roger
after
yet
a
short
pause
happening
to
be
in
tottenham
court
road
i
walked
for
some
distance
behind
a
young
woman
carrying
a
brown
in
her
hand
for
i
sometimes
amuse
myself
in
the
street
by
walking
persistently
behind
some
one
devising
the
unseen
face
in
my
mind
until
the
recognition
of
the
same
step
following
causes
the
person
to
look
round
at
me
and
give
me
the
opportunity
of
comparing
the
two
i
mean
the
one
i
had
devised
and
the
real
one
when
the
young
woman
at
length
turned
her
head
it
was
only
my
astonishment
that
kept
me
from
addressing
her
as
miss
clare
my
surprise
however
gave
me
time
to
see
how
absurd
it
would
have
been
presently
she
turned
down
a
yard
and
disappeared
do
tell
my
cousin
judy
i
said
she
would
believe
it
miss
clare
there
is
much
danger
he
returned
even
if
i
knew
your
cousin
i
should
not
be
likely
to
mention
such
an
incident
in
her
hearing
could
it
have
been
she
said
percivale
thoughtfully
absurd
said
roger
miss
clare
is
a
lady
wherever
she
may
live
i
do
know
said
his
brother
thoughtfully
who
can
tell
it
have
been
beer
she
was
carrying
i
did
say
it
was
beer
returned
roger
i
only
said
it
was
a
one
of
those
brown
squat
stone
jugs
the
best
for
beer
that
i
know
after
all
brown
you
know
with
a
dash
of
gray
brown
jug
or
not
i
wish
i
could
get
a
few
sittings
from
her
she
would
make
a
lovely
cecilia
said
my
husband
brown
jug
and
all
asked
roger
if
only
she
were
a
little
taller
i
objected
and
had
an
aureole
said
my
husband
but
i
might
succeed
in
omitting
the
jug
as
well
as
in
adding
the
aureole
and
another
of
stature
if
only
i
could
get
that
lovely
countenance
on
the
canvas
so
full
of
life
and
yet
of
repose
do
you
think
it
a
little
hard
i
ventured
to
say
i
think
so
said
roger
i
do
said
my
husband
i
know
what
in
it
looks
like
hardness
but
i
think
it
comes
of
the
repression
of
feeling
you
have
studied
her
well
for
your
opportunities
i
said
i
have
and
i
am
sure
whatever
morley
may
say
that
if
there
be
any
truth
at
all
in
those
reports
there
is
some
satisfactory
explanation
of
whatever
has
given
rise
to
them
i
wish
we
knew
anybody
else
that
knew
her
do
try
to
find
some
one
that
does
wynnie
i
do
know
how
to
set
about
it
i
said
i
should
be
only
too
glad
i
will
try
said
roger
does
she
sing
i
have
heard
judy
say
she
sang
divinely
but
the
only
occasion
on
which
i
met
her
at
their
house
that
time
you
could
go
percivale
she
was
never
asked
to
sing
i
suspect
remarked
roger
it
will
turn
out
to
be
only
that
something
of
a
bohemian
like
ourselves
thank
you
roger
but
for
my
part
i
do
consider
myself
a
bohemian
at
all
i
said
i
am
afraid
you
must
rank
with
your
husband
wifie
said
as
the
wives
of
the
working
people
of
london
often
call
their
husbands
then
you
do
count
yourself
a
bohemian
pray
what
significance
do
you
attach
to
the
epithet
i
asked
i
do
know
except
it
signifies
our
resemblance
to
the
gypsies
he
answered
i
do
understand
you
quite
i
believe
the
gypsies
used
to
be
considered
bohemians
interposed
roger
though
they
are
doubtless
of
indian
origin
their
usages
being
quite
different
from
those
amongst
which
they
live
the
name
bohemian
came
to
be
applied
to
painters
musicians
and
such
like
generally
to
whom
save
by
courtesy
no
position
has
yet
been
accorded
by
society
so
called
but
why
have
they
not
yet
vindicated
for
themselves
a
social
position
i
asked
and
that
a
high
one
because
they
are
generally
poor
i
suppose
he
answered
and
society
is
generally
stupid
may
it
not
be
because
they
are
so
often
like
the
gypsies
lawless
in
their
behavior
as
well
as
peculiar
in
their
habits
i
suggested
i
understand
you
perfectly
percivale
rejoined
roger
with
mock
offence
but
how
would
that
apply
to
charlie
not
so
well
as
to
you
i
confess
i
answered
but
there
is
ground
for
it
with
him
too
i
have
thought
it
all
over
many
a
time
said
percivale
and
i
suppose
it
comes
in
part
from
inability
to
understand
the
worth
of
our
calling
and
in
part
from
the
difficulty
of
knowing
where
to
put
us
i
suspect
i
said
one
thing
is
that
so
many
of
them
are
content
to
be
received
as
merely
painters
or
whatever
they
may
be
by
profession
many
you
have
told
me
for
instance
accept
invitations
which
do
not
include
their
wives
they
often
go
to
parties
of
course
where
there
are
no
ladies
said
roger
that
is
not
what
i
mean
i
replied
they
go
to
where
there
are
ladies
and
evening
parties
too
without
their
wives
whoever
does
that
said
percivale
has
at
least
no
right
to
complain
that
he
is
regarded
as
a
bohemian
for
in
accepting
such
invitations
he
accepts
insult
and
himself
insults
his
wife
nothing
irritated
my
bear
so
much
as
to
be
asked
to
dinner
without
me
he
would
not
even
offer
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
declining
the
invitation
for
he
would
say
if
i
give
the
real
reason
namely
that
i
do
not
choose
to
go
where
my
wife
is
excluded
they
will
set
it
down
to
her
jealous
ambition
of
entering
a
sphere
beyond
her
reach
i
will
not
give
a
false
reason
and
indeed
have
no
objection
to
their
seeing
that
i
am
offended
therefore
i
assign
none
if
they
have
any
chivalry
in
them
they
may
find
out
my
reason
readily
enough
i
do
think
i
ever
displeased
him
so
much
as
once
when
i
entreated
him
to
accept
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
earl
of
h
the
fact
was
i
had
been
fancying
it
my
duty
to
persuade
him
to
get
over
his
offence
at
the
omission
of
my
name
for
the
sake
of
the
advantage
it
would
be
to
him
in
his
profession
i
laid
it
before
him
as
gently
and
coaxingly
as
i
could
representing
how
expenses
increased
and
how
the
children
would
be
requiring
education
by
and
by
reminding
him
that
the
reputation
of
more
than
one
of
the
most
popular
painters
had
been
brought
about
in
some
measure
by
their
social
qualities
and
the
friendships
they
made
is
it
likely
your
children
will
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
if
you
prevail
on
their
father
to
play
the
part
of
a
sneaking
parasite
i
was
frightened
he
had
never
spoken
to
me
in
such
a
tone
but
i
saw
too
well
how
deeply
he
was
hurt
to
take
offence
at
his
roughness
i
could
only
beg
him
to
forgive
me
and
promise
never
to
say
such
a
word
again
assuring
him
that
i
believed
as
strongly
as
himself
that
the
best
heritage
of
children
was
their
father
honor
free
from
any
such
clogs
as
the
possession
of
a
wife
encumbers
a
husband
withal
roger
could
of
course
accept
what
invitations
his
connection
with
an
old
and
honorable
family
procured
him
one
evening
he
came
in
late
from
a
dinner
at
lady
bernard
whom
do
you
think
i
took
down
to
dinner
he
asked
almost
before
he
was
seated
lady
bernard
i
said
flying
high
her
dowager
aunt
said
percivale
no
no
miss
clare
miss
clare
we
both
repeated
with
mingled
question
and
exclamation
yes
miss
clare
incredible
as
it
may
appear
he
answered
did
you
ask
her
if
it
was
she
you
saw
carrying
the
jug
of
beer
in
tottenham
court
road
said
percivale
did
you
ask
her
address
i
said
that
is
a
question
more
worthy
of
an
answer
yes
i
did
i
believe
i
did
i
think
i
did
what
is
it
then
upon
my
word
i
have
the
slightest
idea
so
roger
you
have
had
a
perfect
opportunity
and
have
let
it
slip
you
are
a
man
to
be
trusted
indeed
i
do
know
how
it
could
have
been
i
distinctly
remember
approaching
the
subject
more
than
once
or
twice
and
now
first
i
discover
that
i
never
asked
the
question
or
if
i
did
i
am
certain
i
got
no
answer
bewitched
yes
i
suppose
so
or
suggested
percivale
she
did
not
choose
to
tell
you
saw
the
question
coming
and
led
you
away
from
it
never
let
you
ask
it
i
have
heard
that
ladies
can
keep
one
from
saying
what
they
do
want
to
hear
but
she
escape
me
so
a
second
time
indeed
you
do
deserve
another
chance
i
said
you
not
half
so
clever
as
i
took
you
to
be
roger
when
i
think
of
it
though
it
was
a
question
so
easy
to
ask
or
one
you
would
like
to
be
overheard
asking
clearly
bewitched
i
said
but
for
that
i
forgive
you
did
she
sing
no
i
do
suppose
any
one
there
ever
thought
of
asking
such
a
bird
to
sing
you
had
some
music
oh
yes
pretty
good
and
very
bad
miss
clare
forehead
was
crossed
by
no
end
of
flickering
shadows
as
she
listened
it
was
for
want
of
interest
in
her
you
forgot
to
find
out
where
she
lived
you
had
better
take
care
master
roger
take
care
of
what
why
you
do
know
her
address
what
has
that
to
do
with
taking
care
that
you
wo
know
where
to
find
your
heart
if
you
should
happen
to
want
it
oh
i
am
past
that
kind
of
thing
long
ago
you
made
an
uncle
of
me
and
so
on
with
a
good
deal
more
nonsense
but
no
news
of
miss
retreat
i
had
before
this
remarked
to
my
husband
that
it
was
odd
she
had
never
called
since
dining
with
us
but
he
made
little
of
it
saying
that
people
who
gained
their
own
livelihood
ought
to
be
excused
from
attending
to
rules
which
had
their
origin
with
another
class
and
i
had
thought
no
more
about
it
save
in
disappointment
that
she
had
not
given
me
that
opportunity
of
improving
my
acquaintance
with
her
chapter
xvi
a
discovery
one
saturday
night
my
husband
happening
to
be
out
an
event
of
rare
occurrence
roger
called
and
as
there
were
some
things
i
had
not
been
able
to
get
during
the
day
i
asked
him
to
go
with
me
to
tottenham
court
road
it
was
not
far
from
the
region
where
we
lived
and
i
did
a
great
part
of
my
small
shopping
there
the
early
closing
had
if
i
remember
rightly
begun
to
show
itself
anyhow
several
of
the
shops
were
shut
and
we
walked
a
long
way
down
the
street
looking
for
some
place
likely
to
supply
what
i
required
it
was
just
here
i
came
up
with
the
girl
and
the
brown
jug
said
roger
as
we
reached
the
large
dissenting
chapel
that
adventure
seems
to
have
taken
a
great
hold
of
you
roger
i
said
she
so
like
miss
clare
he
returned
i
ca
get
the
one
face
clear
of
the
other
when
i
met
her
at
lady
bernard
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
was
the
brown
jug
were
you
as
much
pleased
with
her
conversation
as
at
our
house
i
asked
even
more
he
answered
i
found
her
ideas
of
art
so
wide
as
well
as
just
and
accurate
that
i
was
puzzled
to
think
where
she
had
had
opportunity
of
developing
them
i
questioned
her
about
it
and
found
she
was
in
the
habit
of
going
as
often
as
she
could
spare
time
to
the
national
gallery
where
her
custom
was
she
said
not
to
pass
from
picture
to
picture
but
keep
to
one
until
it
formed
itself
in
her
mind
that
is
the
expression
she
used
explaining
herself
to
mean
until
she
seemed
to
know
what
the
painter
had
set
himself
to
do
and
why
this
was
and
that
was
which
she
could
not
at
first
understand
clearly
without
ever
having
taken
a
pencil
in
her
hand
she
has
educated
herself
to
a
keen
perception
of
what
is
demanded
of
a
true
picture
of
course
the
root
of
it
lies
in
her
musical
there
he
cried
suddenly
as
we
came
opposite
a
paved
passage
that
is
the
place
i
saw
her
go
down
then
you
do
think
the
girl
with
the
was
miss
clare
after
all
not
in
the
least
i
told
you
i
could
not
separate
them
in
my
mind
well
i
must
say
it
seems
odd
a
girl
like
that
and
miss
clare
why
as
often
as
you
speak
of
the
one
you
seem
to
think
of
the
other
in
fact
he
returned
i
am
as
i
say
unable
to
dissociate
them
but
if
you
had
seen
the
girl
you
would
not
wonder
the
likeness
was
absolutely
complete
i
believe
you
do
consider
them
one
and
the
same
and
i
am
more
than
half
inclined
to
think
so
myself
remembering
what
judy
said
is
it
possible
some
one
who
knows
miss
clare
may
have
seen
this
girl
and
been
misled
by
the
likeness
but
where
then
does
miss
clare
live
nobody
seems
to
know
you
have
never
asked
any
one
but
mrs
morley
you
have
yourself
however
given
me
reason
to
think
she
avoids
the
subject
if
she
did
live
anywhere
hereabout
she
would
have
some
cause
to
avoid
it
i
had
stopped
to
look
down
the
passage
suppose
said
roger
some
one
were
to
come
past
now
and
see
percivale
the
wife
of
the
celebrated
painter
standing
in
tottenham
court
road
beside
the
of
a
corner
talking
to
a
young
man
yes
it
might
have
given
occasion
for
scandal
i
said
to
avoid
it
let
us
go
down
the
court
and
see
what
it
is
like
it
not
a
fit
place
for
you
to
go
into
if
it
were
in
my
father
parish
i
should
have
known
everybody
in
it
you
have
the
slightest
idea
what
you
are
saying
come
anyhow
and
let
us
see
what
the
place
is
like
i
insisted
without
another
word
he
gave
me
his
arm
and
down
the
court
we
went
past
the
flaring
and
into
the
gloom
beyond
it
was
one
of
those
places
of
which
while
the
general
effect
remains
vivid
in
one
mind
the
salient
points
are
so
few
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
much
by
way
of
description
the
houses
had
once
been
occupied
by
people
in
better
circumstances
than
its
present
inhabitants
and
indeed
they
looked
all
decent
enough
until
turning
two
right
angles
we
came
upon
another
sort
they
were
still
as
large
and
had
plenty
of
windows
but
in
the
light
of
a
single
lamp
at
the
corner
they
looked
very
dirty
and
wretched
and
dreary
a
little
shop
with
dried
herrings
and
in
the
window
was
lighted
by
a
tallow
candle
set
in
a
bottle
with
a
card
of
kinahan
ll
whiskey
for
a
reflector
they
ca
have
many
customers
to
the
extent
of
a
bottle
said
roger
but
no
doubt
they
have
some
privileges
from
the
at
the
corner
for
hanging
up
the
card
the
houses
had
sunk
areas
just
wide
enough
for
a
stair
and
the
basements
seemed
full
of
tenants
there
was
a
little
wind
blowing
so
that
the
atmosphere
was
tolerable
notwithstanding
a
few
stray
leaves
of
cabbage
suggestive
of
others
in
a
more
objectionable
condition
not
far
off
a
confused
noise
of
loud
voices
calling
and
scolding
hitherto
drowned
by
the
tumult
of
the
street
now
reached
our
ears
the
place
took
one
turn
more
and
then
the
origin
of
it
became
apparent
at
the
farther
end
of
the
passage
was
another
lamp
the
light
of
which
shone
upon
a
group
of
men
and
women
in
altercation
which
had
not
yet
come
to
blows
it
might
including
children
have
numbered
twenty
of
which
some
seemed
drunk
and
all
more
or
less
excited
roger
turned
to
go
back
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
them
but
i
felt
inclined
i
hardly
knew
why
to
linger
a
little
should
any
danger
offer
it
would
be
easy
to
gain
the
open
thoroughfare
it
not
at
all
a
fit
place
for
a
lady
he
said
certainly
not
i
answered
it
hardly
seems
a
fit
place
for
human
beings
these
are
human
beings
though
let
us
go
through
it
he
still
hesitated
but
as
i
went
on
he
could
but
follow
me
i
wanted
to
see
what
the
attracting
centre
of
the
little
crowd
was
and
that
it
must
be
occupied
with
some
affair
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
i
judged
from
the
fact
that
a
good
many
superterrestrial
spectators
looked
down
from
the
windows
at
various
elevations
upon
the
disputants
whose
voices
now
and
then
lulled
for
a
moment
only
to
break
out
in
fresh
objurgation
and
dispute
drawing
a
little
nearer
a
slight
parting
of
the
crowd
revealed
its
core
to
us
it
was
a
little
woman
without
bonnet
or
shawl
whose
back
was
towards
us
she
turned
from
side
to
side
now
talking
to
one
and
now
to
another
of
the
surrounding
circle
at
first
i
thought
she
was
setting
forth
her
grievances
in
the
hope
of
sympathy
or
perhaps
of
justice
but
i
soon
perceived
that
her
motions
were
too
calm
for
that
sometimes
the
crowd
would
speak
altogether
sometimes
keep
silent
for
a
full
minute
while
she
went
on
talking
when
she
turned
her
face
towards
us
roger
and
i
turned
ours
and
stared
at
each
other
the
face
was
disfigured
by
a
swollen
eye
evidently
from
a
blow
but
clearly
enough
if
it
was
not
miss
clare
it
was
the
young
woman
of
the
neither
of
us
spoke
but
turned
once
more
to
watch
the
result
of
what
seemed
to
have
at
length
settled
down
into
an
almost
amicable
conference
after
a
few
more
grumbles
and
protestations
the
group
began
to
break
up
into
twos
and
threes
these
the
young
woman
seemed
to
set
herself
to
break
up
again
here
however
an
fellow
like
a
costermonger
with
a
broken
nose
came
up
to
us
and
with
a
strong
irish
accent
and
offensive
manner
but
still
with
a
touch
of
irish
breeding
requested
to
know
what
our
business
was
roger
asked
if
the
place
was
a
thoroughfare
not
for
the
likes
o
you
he
answered
as
comes
pryin
after
the
likes
of
us
we
manage
our
own
affairs
down
here
do
you
better
be
off
my
lady
i
have
my
doubts
what
sort
of
reply
roger
might
have
returned
if
he
had
been
alone
but
he
certainly
spoke
in
a
very
conciliatory
manner
which
however
the
man
did
not
seem
to
appreciate
for
he
called
it
blarney
but
the
young
woman
catching
sight
of
our
little
group
and
supposing
i
presume
that
it
also
required
dispersion
approached
us
she
had
come
within
a
yard
of
us
when
suddenly
her
face
brightened
and
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
surprise
percivale
you
here
it
was
indeed
miss
clare
without
the
least
embarrassment
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
but
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
take
it
very
cordially
roger
however
behaved
to
her
as
if
they
stood
in
a
and
this
brought
me
to
a
sense
of
propriety
i
do
look
very
respectable
i
fear
she
said
putting
her
hand
over
her
eye
the
fact
is
i
have
had
a
blow
and
it
will
look
worse
were
you
coming
to
find
me
i
forget
what
lame
answer
either
of
us
gave
will
you
come
in
she
said
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
declined
for
all
my
fine
talk
to
roger
i
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
entering
one
of
those
houses
i
can
only
say
in
excuse
that
my
whole
mind
was
in
a
condition
of
bewilderment
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
then
she
asked
in
a
tone
slightly
marked
with
disappointment
i
thought
thank
you
no
i
answered
hardly
knowing
what
my
words
were
then
she
said
and
nodding
kindly
turned
and
entered
one
of
the
houses
we
also
turned
in
silence
and
walked
out
of
the
court
why
did
you
go
with
her
said
roger
as
soon
as
we
were
in
the
street
i
sorry
i
did
if
you
wanted
to
go
roger
but
i
think
you
might
have
gone
seeing
i
was
with
you
he
said
i
do
think
it
would
have
been
at
all
a
proper
thing
to
do
without
knowing
more
about
her
i
answered
a
little
hurt
you
ca
tell
what
sort
of
a
place
it
may
be
it
a
good
place
wherever
she
is
or
i
am
much
mistaken
he
returned
you
may
be
much
mistaken
roger
true
i
have
been
mistaken
more
than
once
in
my
life
i
am
not
mistaken
this
time
though
i
presume
you
would
have
gone
if
i
had
been
with
you
certainly
if
she
had
asked
me
which
is
not
very
likely
and
you
lay
the
disappointment
of
missing
a
glimpse
into
the
sweet
privacy
of
such
a
home
to
my
charge
it
was
a
spiteful
speech
and
roger
silence
made
me
feel
it
was
which
with
the
rather
patronizing
opinion
i
had
of
roger
i
found
not
a
little
galling
so
i
too
kept
silence
and
nothing
beyond
a
platitude
had
passed
between
us
when
i
found
myself
at
my
own
door
my
shopping
utterly
forgotten
and
something
acid
on
my
mind
do
you
mean
to
come
in
i
said
for
he
held
out
his
hand
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
bid
me
my
husband
will
be
home
soon
if
he
has
not
come
already
you
need
be
bored
with
my
company
you
can
sit
in
the
study
i
think
i
had
better
not
he
answered
i
am
very
sorry
roger
if
i
was
rude
to
you
i
said
but
how
could
you
wish
me
to
be
with
a
woman
who
visits
people
who
she
is
well
aware
would
not
think
of
inviting
her
if
they
had
a
notion
of
her
surroundings
that
ca
be
right
i
am
certain
i
protest
i
feel
just
as
if
i
had
been
reading
an
story
an
unnatural
fiction
i
can
not
get
these
things
together
in
my
mind
at
all
do
what
i
will
there
must
be
some
way
of
accounting
for
it
said
roger
no
doubt
i
returned
but
who
knows
what
that
way
may
be
you
may
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
the
people
at
whose
houses
she
visits
know
nothing
about
her
habits
is
it
at
all
likely
they
do
roger
do
you
think
it
is
i
know
at
least
that
my
cousin
dispensed
with
her
services
as
soon
as
she
came
to
the
knowledge
of
certain
facts
concerning
these
very
points
excuse
me
certain
rumors
very
uncertain
facts
when
you
are
cross
the
slightest
play
upon
words
is
an
offence
i
knocked
at
the
door
in
dudgeon
then
turned
and
said
my
cousin
judy
roger
but
here
i
paused
for
i
had
nothing
ready
anger
makes
some
people
cleverer
for
the
moment
but
when
i
am
angry
i
am
always
stupid
roger
finished
the
sentence
for
me
your
cousin
judy
is
you
must
allow
a
very
conventional
woman
he
said
she
is
very
anyhow
and
what
do
you
say
to
lady
bernard
she
has
repudiated
miss
clare
acquaintance
so
far
as
i
know
but
answer
me
do
you
believe
lady
bernard
would
invite
her
to
meet
her
friends
if
she
knew
all
depend
upon
it
lady
bernard
knows
what
she
is
about
people
of
her
rank
can
afford
to
be
unconventional
this
irritated
me
yet
more
for
it
implied
that
i
was
influenced
by
the
conventionality
which
both
he
and
my
husband
despised
and
sarah
opening
the
door
that
instant
i
stepped
in
without
even
saying
to
him
before
she
closed
it
however
i
heard
my
husband
voice
and
ran
out
again
to
welcome
him
he
and
roger
had
already
met
in
the
little
front
garden
they
did
not
shake
hands
they
never
did
they
always
met
as
if
they
had
parted
only
an
hour
ago
what
were
you
and
my
wife
quarrelling
about
rodge
i
heard
percivale
ask
and
paused
on
the
middle
of
the
stair
to
hear
his
answer
how
do
you
know
we
were
quarrelling
returned
roger
gloomily
i
heard
you
from
the
very
end
of
the
street
said
my
husband
that
not
so
far
said
roger
for
indeed
one
house
with
i
confess
a
good
space
of
garden
on
each
side
of
it
and
the
end
of
another
house
finished
the
street
but
notwithstanding
the
shortness
of
the
distance
it
stung
me
to
the
quick
here
had
i
been
regarding
not
even
with
contempt
only
with
disgust
the
quarrel
in
which
miss
clare
was
mixed
up
and
half
an
hour
after
my
own
voice
was
heard
in
dispute
with
my
husband
brother
from
the
end
of
the
street
in
which
we
lived
i
felt
humiliated
and
did
not
rush
down
the
remaining
half
of
the
steps
to
implore
my
protection
against
roger
crossness
too
far
to
hear
a
wife
and
a
brother
though
returned
percivale
jocosely
go
on
said
roger
pray
go
on
dogs
comes
next
i
beg
percivale
pardon
i
will
amend
the
quotation
dogs
delight
to
worry
cats
i
exclaimed
and
rushing
down
the
steps
i
kissed
roger
before
i
kissed
my
husband
i
meant
i
mean
i
was
going
to
say
now
roger
do
add
to
your
vices
flattery
and
and
fibbing
he
subjoined
i
did
say
so
you
only
meant
it
do
begin
again
interposed
percivale
come
in
and
refer
the
cause
in
dispute
to
me
we
did
go
in
and
we
did
refer
the
matter
to
him
by
the
time
we
had
between
us
told
him
the
facts
of
the
case
however
the
point
in
dispute
between
us
appeared
to
have
grown
hazy
the
fact
being
that
neither
of
us
cared
to
say
any
thing
more
about
it
percivale
insisted
that
there
was
no
question
before
the
court
at
length
roger
turning
from
me
to
his
brother
said
it
not
worth
mentioning
charley
but
what
led
to
our
irreconcilable
quarrel
was
this
i
thought
wynnie
might
have
accepted
miss
invitation
to
walk
in
and
pay
her
a
visit
and
wynnie
thought
me
i
suppose
too
ready
to
sacrifice
her
dignity
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
little
more
of
the
object
of
our
altercation
there
my
husband
turned
to
me
and
said
percivale
do
you
accept
this
as
a
correct
representation
of
your
difference
well
i
answered
hesitating
yes
on
the
whole
all
i
object
to
is
the
word
i
retract
it
cried
roger
and
accept
any
substitute
you
prefer
let
it
stand
i
returned
it
will
do
as
well
as
a
better
i
only
wish
to
say
that
it
was
not
exactly
my
dignity
no
no
your
sense
of
propriety
said
my
husband
and
then
sat
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
pondering
like
a
judge
at
length
he
spoke
wife
he
said
you
might
have
gone
with
your
brother
i
think
but
i
quite
understand
your
disinclination
at
the
same
time
a
more
generous
judgment
of
miss
clare
might
have
prevented
any
difference
of
feeling
in
the
matter
but
i
said
greatly
inclined
to
cry
i
only
postponed
my
judgment
concerning
her
and
i
only
postponed
my
crying
for
i
was
very
much
ashamed
of
myself
chapter
xvii
miss
clare
of
course
my
husband
and
i
talked
a
good
deal
more
about
what
i
ought
to
have
done
and
i
saw
clearly
enough
that
i
ought
to
have
run
any
risk
there
might
be
in
accepting
her
invitation
i
had
been
foolishly
taking
more
care
of
myself
than
was
necessary
i
told
him
i
would
write
to
roger
and
ask
him
when
he
could
take
me
there
again
i
will
tell
you
a
better
plan
he
said
i
will
go
with
you
myself
and
that
will
get
rid
of
half
the
awkwardness
there
would
be
if
you
went
with
roger
after
having
with
him
refused
to
go
in
but
would
that
be
fair
to
roger
she
would
think
i
did
like
going
with
him
and
i
would
go
with
roger
anywhere
it
was
i
who
did
not
want
to
go
he
did
my
plan
however
will
pave
the
way
for
a
full
explanation
or
confession
rather
i
suppose
it
will
turn
out
to
be
i
know
you
are
burning
to
make
it
with
your
mania
for
confessing
your
faults
i
knew
he
did
not
like
me
the
worse
for
that
though
the
next
time
he
added
you
can
go
with
roger
always
supposing
you
should
feel
inclined
to
continue
the
acquaintance
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
set
him
right
in
her
eyes
the
plan
seemed
unobjectionable
but
just
then
percivale
was
very
busy
and
i
being
almost
as
much
occupied
with
my
baby
as
he
was
with
his
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
passed
during
which
our
duty
to
miss
clare
was
i
will
not
say
either
forgotten
or
neglected
but
unfulfilled
one
afternoon
i
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
my
father
he
not
unfrequently
surprised
us
why
did
you
let
us
know
papa
i
said
a
surprise
is
very
nice
but
an
expectation
is
much
nicer
and
lasts
so
much
longer
i
might
have
disappointed
you
even
if
you
had
i
should
have
already
enjoyed
the
expectation
that
would
be
safe
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
excuse
of
surprises
he
rejoined
but
in
the
present
case
i
have
a
special
one
to
offer
i
was
taken
with
a
sudden
desire
to
see
you
it
was
very
foolish
no
doubt
and
you
are
quite
right
in
wishing
i
were
here
only
going
to
come
do
be
so
cruel
papa
scarcely
a
day
passes
in
which
do
not
long
to
see
my
baby
makes
me
think
more
about
my
home
than
ever
then
she
a
very
healthy
baby
if
one
may
judge
by
her
influences
but
you
know
if
i
had
had
to
give
you
warning
i
could
not
have
been
here
before
and
surely
you
will
acknowledge
that
however
nice
expectation
may
be
presence
is
better
yes
papa
we
will
make
a
compromise
if
you
please
every
time
you
think
of
coming
to
me
you
must
either
come
at
once
or
let
me
know
you
are
coming
do
you
agree
to
that
i
agree
he
said
so
i
have
the
pleasure
of
a
constant
expectation
any
day
he
may
walk
in
unheralded
or
by
any
post
i
may
receive
a
letter
with
the
news
that
he
is
coming
at
such
a
time
as
we
sat
at
dinner
that
evening
he
asked
if
we
had
lately
seen
miss
clare
i
seen
her
only
once
and
percivale
not
at
all
since
you
were
here
last
papa
i
answered
how
that
he
asked
again
a
little
surprised
have
you
got
her
address
yet
i
want
very
much
to
know
more
of
her
so
do
we
i
have
got
her
address
but
i
know
where
she
lives
what
do
you
mean
wynnie
has
she
taken
to
dark
sayings
of
late
percivale
i
told
him
the
whole
story
of
my
adventure
with
roger
and
the
reports
judy
had
prejudiced
my
judgment
withal
he
heard
me
through
in
silence
for
it
was
a
rule
with
him
never
to
interrupt
a
narrator
he
used
to
say
you
will
generally
get
at
more
and
in
a
better
fashion
if
you
let
any
narrative
take
its
own
devious
course
without
the
interruption
of
requested
explanations
by
the
time
it
is
over
you
will
find
the
questions
you
wanted
to
ask
mostly
vanished
describe
the
place
to
me
wynnie
he
said
when
i
had
ended
i
must
go
and
see
her
i
have
a
suspicion
amounting
almost
to
a
conviction
that
she
is
one
whose
acquaintance
ought
to
be
cultivated
at
any
cost
there
is
some
grand
explanation
of
all
this
contradictory
strangeness
i
do
think
i
could
describe
the
place
to
you
so
that
you
would
find
it
but
if
percivale
would
mind
my
going
with
you
instead
of
with
him
i
should
be
only
too
happy
to
accompany
you
may
i
percivale
certainly
it
will
do
just
as
well
to
go
with
your
father
as
with
me
i
only
stipulate
that
if
you
are
both
satisfied
you
take
roger
with
you
next
time
of
course
i
will
then
we
go
morning
said
my
father
i
do
think
she
is
likely
to
be
at
home
in
the
morning
i
said
she
goes
out
giving
lessons
you
know
and
the
probability
is
that
at
that
time
we
should
not
find
her
then
why
not
he
rejoined
why
not
if
you
wish
it
i
do
wish
it
then
if
you
knew
the
place
though
i
think
you
would
prefer
going
a
little
earlier
than
we
can
ah
well
we
will
go
evening
we
could
dine
early
could
we
so
it
was
arranged
my
father
went
about
some
business
in
the
morning
we
dined
early
and
set
out
about
six
my
father
was
getting
an
old
man
and
if
any
protection
had
been
required
he
could
not
have
been
half
so
active
as
roger
and
yet
i
felt
twice
as
safe
with
him
i
am
satisfied
that
the
deepest
sense
of
safety
even
in
respect
of
physical
dangers
can
spring
only
from
moral
causes
neither
do
you
half
so
much
fear
evil
happening
to
you
as
fear
evil
happening
which
ought
not
to
happen
to
you
i
believe
what
made
me
so
courageous
was
the
undeveloped
that
if
any
evil
should
overtake
me
in
my
father
company
i
should
not
care
it
would
be
all
right
then
anyhow
the
repose
was
in
my
father
himself
and
neither
in
his
strength
nor
his
wisdom
the
former
might
fail
the
latter
might
mistake
but
so
long
as
i
was
with
him
in
what
i
did
no
harm
worth
counting
harm
could
come
to
me
only
such
as
i
should
neither
lament
nor
feel
scarcely
a
shadow
of
danger
however
showed
itself
it
was
a
cold
evening
in
the
middle
of
november
the
light
which
had
been
scanty
enough
all
day
had
vanished
in
a
thin
penetrating
fog
round
every
lamp
in
the
street
was
a
colored
halo
the
gay
shops
gleamed
like
of
aladdin
hollowed
out
of
the
darkness
and
the
people
that
hurried
or
sauntered
along
looked
inscrutable
where
could
they
live
had
they
anybody
to
love
them
were
their
hearts
quiet
under
their
dingy
cloaks
and
shabby
coats
yes
returned
my
father
to
whom
i
had
said
something
to
this
effect
what
would
not
one
give
for
a
peep
into
the
mysteries
of
all
these
worlds
that
go
crowding
past
us
if
we
could
but
see
through
the
opaque
husk
of
them
some
would
glitter
and
glow
like
diamond
mines
others
perhaps
would
look
mere
earthy
holes
some
of
them
forsaken
quarries
with
a
great
pool
of
stagnant
water
in
the
bottom
some
like
vast
of
gloom
into
which
you
dared
not
carry
a
lighted
lamp
for
fear
of
explosion
some
would
be
mere
others
libraries
without
a
corner
anywhere
but
what
a
wealth
of
creation
they
show
and
what
infinite
room
for
hope
it
affords
but
do
you
think
papa
there
may
be
something
of
worth
lying
even
in
the
or
at
the
bottom
of
the
stagnant
water
in
the
forsaken
quarry
indeed
i
do
though
i
met
more
than
one
in
my
lifetime
concerning
whom
i
felt
compelled
to
say
that
it
wanted
keener
eyes
than
mine
to
discover
the
hidden
jewel
but
then
there
keener
eyes
than
mine
for
there
are
more
loving
eyes
myself
i
have
been
able
to
see
good
very
clearly
where
some
could
see
none
and
shall
i
doubt
that
god
can
see
good
where
my
can
see
none
be
sure
of
this
that
as
he
is
for
the
evil
in
his
creatures
to
destroy
it
he
would
if
it
were
possible
be
yet
for
the
good
to
nourish
and
cherish
it
if
men
would
only
side
with
the
good
that
is
in
them
will
that
the
seed
should
grow
and
bring
forth
fruit
chapter
xviii
miss
clare
home
we
had
now
arrived
at
the
passage
the
was
flaring
through
the
fog
a
man
in
a
fustian
jacket
came
out
of
it
and
walked
slowly
down
before
us
with
the
clay
of
the
clinging
to
him
as
high
as
the
leather
straps
with
which
his
trousers
were
confined
under
the
knee
the
place
was
quiet
we
and
the
brickmaker
seemed
the
only
people
in
it
when
we
turned
the
last
corner
he
was
walking
in
at
the
very
door
where
miss
clare
had
disappeared
when
i
told
my
father
that
was
the
house
he
called
after
the
man
who
came
out
again
and
standing
on
the
pavement
waited
until
we
came
up
does
miss
clare
live
in
this
house
my
father
asked
she
do
answered
the
man
curtly
first
floor
no
nor
yet
the
second
nor
the
third
she
live
nearer
heaven
than
another
in
the
house
myself
i
live
in
the
attic
and
so
do
she
there
is
a
way
of
living
nearer
to
heaven
than
that
said
my
father
laying
his
hand
with
a
right
old
man
grace
on
his
shoulder
i
dunno
you
was
to
go
up
in
a
belloon
said
the
man
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
which
my
father
took
to
mean
that
he
understood
him
better
than
he
chose
to
acknowledge
but
he
did
not
pursue
the
figure
he
was
a
rough
lumpish
young
man
with
good
but
dull
features
only
his
blue
eye
was
clear
he
looked
my
father
full
in
the
face
and
i
thought
i
saw
a
dim
smile
about
his
mouth
you
know
her
then
i
suppose
everybody
in
the
house
knows
there
ai
many
the
likes
o
her
as
lives
wi
the
likes
of
us
you
go
right
up
to
the
top
i
do
know
if
she
in
but
any
one
be
able
to
tell
you
i
ai
been
home
yet
my
father
thanked
him
and
we
entered
the
house
and
began
to
ascend
the
stair
was
very
much
worn
and
rather
dirty
and
some
of
the
banisters
were
broken
away
but
the
walls
were
tolerably
clean
up
we
met
a
little
girl
with
tangled
hair
and
tattered
garments
carrying
a
bottle
do
you
know
my
dear
said
my
father
to
her
whether
miss
clare

she

here
a
lady
an
a
you

about
yer
business
and
be
back
direckly
cried
a
gruff
voice
from
somewhere
above
that
mother
said
the
child
and
ran
down
the
stair
when
we
reached
the
second
floor
there
stood
a
big
fat
woman
on
the
landing
with
her
face
red
and
her
hair
looking
like
that
of
a
doll
ill
stuck
on
she
did
not
speak
but
stood
waiting
to
see
what
we
wanted
i
told
miss
clare
lives
here
said
my
father
can
you
tell
me
my
good
woman
whether

home
i
neither
good
woman
nor
bad
woman
she
returned
in
an
insolent
tone
i
beg
your
pardon
said
my
father
but
you
see
i
did
know
your
name
an
ye
do
know
it
yet

call
to
know

i
ha

to
go
about
that
way
arter
poor
girls
as

mothers
to
help
i
assure
you
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
my
father
i
a
country
clergyman
myself
and
have
no
duty
in
london
well
that
where
they
took
her
down
in
the
country
i
make
no
doubt
but
you
had
your
finger
in
that
pie
you
do
come
here
to
call
upon
us
for
the
pleasure
o
makin
our
acquaintance
ha
ha
ha
you
allus
arter
somethin
troublesome
i
adwise
you
sir
and
miss
to
let
well
alone
sleepin
dogs
wo
bite
but
you
better
let
lie
and
that
i
tell
you
believe
me
said
my
father
quite
quietly
i
have
the
least
knowledge
of
your
daughter
the
country
a
bigger
place
than
you
seem
to
think
far
bigger
than
london
itself
all
i
wanted
to
trouble
you
about
was
to
tell
us
whether
miss
clare
was
at
home
or
not
i
do
know
no
one
o
that
name
if
it
grannie
you
mean
she
at
home
i
know
though
it
not
much
reason
i
got
to
care
whether
she
at
home
or
not
it
a
young
woman
i
mean
said
my
father
a
young
lady
then
well
i
do
care
what
you
call
her
i
dare
say
it
be
all
one
come
judgment
you
better
go
up
till
you
ca
go
no
further
an
knocks
yer
head
agin
the
tiles
and
then
you
may
feel
about
for
a
door
and
knock
at
that
and
see
if
the
party
as
opens
it
is
the
party
you
wants
so
saying
she
turned
in
at
a
door
behind
her
and
shut
it
but
we
could
hear
her
still
growling
and
grumbling
it
very
odd
said
my
father
with
a
bewildered
smile
i
think
better
do
as
she
says
and
go
up
till
we
knock
our
heads
against
the
tiles
we
climbed
two
stairs
more
the
last
very
steep
and
so
dark
that
when
we
reached
the
top
we
found
it
necessary
to
follow
the
woman
directions
literally
and
feel
about
for
a
door
but
we
had
not
to
feel
long
or
far
for
there
was
one
close
to
the
top
of
the
stair
my
father
knocked
there
was
no
reply
but
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
chair
and
presently
some
one
opened
it
the
only
light
being
behind
her
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
the
size
and
shape
were
those
of
miss
clare
she
did
not
leave
us
in
doubt
however
for
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
saying
this
kind
of
you
percivale
then
to
my
father
saying
i
very
glad
to
see
you
walton
will
you
walk
in
we
followed
her
into
the
room
it
was
not
very
small
for
it
occupied
nearly
the
breadth
of
the
house
on
one
side
the
roof
sloped
so
nearly
to
the
floor
that
there
was
not
height
enough
to
stand
erect
in
on
the
other
side
the
sloping
part
was
partitioned
off
evidently
for
a
bedroom
but
what
a
change
it
was
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
by
the
light
of
a
single
mould
candle
i
saw
that
the
floor
was
as
clean
as
old
boards
could
be
made
and
i
wondered
whether
she
scrubbed
them
herself
i
know
now
that
she
did
the
two
dormer
windows
were
hung
with
white
dimity
curtains
back
in
the
angle
of
the
roof
between
the
windows
stood
an
old
bureau
there
was
little
more
than
room
between
the
top
of
it
and
the
ceiling
for
a
little
plaster
statuette
with
bound
hands
and
a
strangely
crowned
head
a
few
books
on
hanging
shelves
were
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
door
to
the
other
room
and
the
walls
which
were
whitewashed
were
a
good
deal
covered
with
whether
engravings
or
etchings
or
lithographs
i
could
not
then
see
none
of
them
framed
only
mounted
on
there
was
a
fire
cheerfully
burning
in
the
gable
and
opposite
to
that
stood
a
tall
cabinet
piano
in
faded
red
silk
it
was
open
and
on
the
lay
handel
verdi
prati
for
i
managed
to
glance
at
it
as
we
left
a
few
wooden
chairs
and
one
very
covered
with
striped
chintz
from
which
not
glaze
only
but
color
almost
had
disappeared
with
an
oblong
table
of
deal
completed
the
furniture
of
the
room
she
made
my
father
sit
down
in
the
placed
me
one
in
front
of
the
fire
and
took
another
at
the
corner
opposite
my
father
a
moment
of
silence
followed
which
i
having
a
guilty
conscience
felt
awkward
but
my
father
never
allowed
awkwardness
to
accumulate
i
had
hoped
to
have
been
able
to
call
upon
you
long
ago
miss
clare
but
there
was
some
difficulty
in
finding
out
where
you
lived
you
are
no
longer
surprised
at
that
difficulty
i
presume
she
returned
with
a
smile
but
said
my
father
if
you
will
allow
an
old
man
to
speak
freely
say
what
you
please
walton
i
promise
to
answer
question
think
proper
to
ask
me
my
dear
miss
clare
i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
catechising
you
though
of
course
i
shall
be
grateful
for
what
confidence
you
please
to
put
in
me
what
i
meant
to
say
might
indeed
have
taken
the
form
of
a
question
but
as
such
could
have
been
intended
only
for
you
to
answer
to
yourself
whether
namely
it
was
wise
to
place
yourself
at
such
a
disadvantage
as
living
in
this
quarter
must
be
to
you
if
you
were
acquainted
with
my
history
you
would
perhaps
hesitate
walton
before
you
said
i
at
such
disadvantage
here
a
thought
struck
me
i
fancy
papa
it
is
not
for
her
own
sake
miss
clare
lives
here
i
hope
not
she
interposed
i
believe
i
went
on
she
has
a
grandmother
who
probably
has
grown
accustomed
to
the
place
and
is
unwilling
to
leave
it
she
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
i
see
she
exclaimed
how
stupid
i
am
you
have
heard
some
of
the
people
in
the
house
talk
about
that
me
i
am
known
in
the
house
as
grannie
and
have
been
for
a
good
many
years
now
i
can
hardly
without
thinking
tell
for
how
many
again
she
laughed
heartily
and
my
father
and
i
shared
her
merriment
how
many
grandchildren
have
you
then
pray
miss
clare
let
me
see
she
thought
for
a
minute
i
could
easily
tell
you
if
it
were
only
the
people
in
this
house
i
had
to
reckon
up
they
are
about
five
and
thirty
but
unfortunately
the
name
has
been
caught
up
in
the
neighboring
houses
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
in
consequence
i
can
not
with
certainty
say
how
many
grandchildren
i
have
i
think
i
know
them
all
however
and
i
fancy
that
is
more
than
many
an
english
grandmother
with
children
in
america
india
and
australia
can
say
for
herself
certainly
she
was
not
older
than
i
was
and
while
hearing
her
merry
laugh
and
seeing
her
young
face
overflowed
with
smiles
which
appeared
to
come
sparkling
out
of
her
eyes
as
out
of
two
one
could
not
help
feeling
puzzled
how
even
in
the
jest
she
could
have
got
the
name
of
grannie
but
i
could
at
the
same
time
recall
expressions
of
her
countenance
which
would
much
better
agree
with
the
name
than
that
which
now
shone
from
it
would
you
like
to
hear
she
said
when
our
merriment
had
a
little
subsided
how
i
have
so
easily
arrived
at
the
honorable
name
of
grannie
at
least
all
i
know
about
it
i
should
be
delighted
said
my
father
you
do
know
what
you
are
pledging
yourself
to
when
you
say
so
she
rejoined
again
laughing
you
will
have
to
hear
the
whole
of
my
story
from
the
beginning
again
i
say
i
shall
be
delighted
returned
my
father
confident
that
her
history
could
be
the
source
of
nothing
but
pleasure
to
him
chapter
xix
her
story
thereupon
miss
clare
began
i
do
not
pretend
to
give
her
very
words
but
i
must
tell
her
story
as
if
she
were
telling
it
herself
i
shall
be
as
true
as
i
can
to
the
facts
and
hope
to
catch
something
of
the
tone
of
the
narrator
as
i
go
on
my
mother
died
when
i
was
very
young
and
i
was
left
alone
with
my
father
for
i
was
his
only
child
he
was
a
studious
and
thoughtful
man
it
be
the
partiality
of
a
daughter
i
know
but
i
am
not
necessarily
wrong
in
believing
that
diffidence
in
his
own
powers
alone
prevented
him
from
distinguishing
himself
as
it
was
he
supported
himself
and
me
by
literary
work
of
i
presume
a
secondary
order
he
would
spend
all
his
mornings
for
many
weeks
in
the
library
of
the
british
museum
reading
and
making
notes
after
which
he
would
sit
writing
at
home
for
as
long
or
longer
i
should
have
found
it
very
dull
during
the
former
of
these
times
had
he
not
early
discovered
that
i
had
some
capacity
for
music
and
provided
for
me
what
i
now
know
to
have
been
the
best
instruction
to
be
had
his
feeling
alone
had
guided
him
right
for
he
was
without
musical
knowledge
i
believe
he
could
not
have
found
me
a
better
teacher
in
all
europe
her
character
was
lovely
and
her
music
the
natural
outcome
of
its
harmony
but
i
must
not
forget
it
is
about
myself
i
have
to
tell
you
i
went
to
her
then
almost
every
day
for
a
time
but
how
long
that
was
i
can
only
guess
it
must
have
been
several
years
i
think
else
i
could
not
have
attained
what
proficiency
i
had
when
my
sorrow
came
upon
me
what
my
father
wrote
i
can
not
tell
how
gladly
would
i
now
read
the
shortest
sentence
i
knew
to
be
his
he
never
told
me
for
what
journals
he
wrote
or
even
for
what
publishers
i
fancy
it
was
work
in
which
his
brain
was
more
interested
than
his
heart
and
which
he
was
always
hoping
to
exchange
for
something
more
to
his
mind
after
his
death
i
could
discover
scarcely
a
scrap
of
his
writings
and
not
a
hint
to
guide
me
to
what
he
had
written
i
believe
we
went
on
living
from
hand
to
mouth
my
father
never
getting
so
far
ahead
of
the
wolf
as
to
be
able
to
pause
and
choose
his
way
but
i
was
very
happy
and
would
have
been
no
whit
less
happy
if
he
had
explained
our
circumstances
for
that
would
have
conveyed
to
me
no
hint
of
danger
neither
has
any
of
the
suffering
i
have
had
at
least
any
keen
enough
to
be
worth
dwelling
upon
sprung
from
personal
privation
although
i
am
not
unacquainted
with
hunger
and
cold
my
happiest
time
was
when
my
father
asked
me
to
play
to
him
while
he
wrote
and
i
sat
down
to
my
old
cabinet
broadwood
the
one
you
see
there
is
as
like
it
as
i
could
find
and
played
any
thing
and
every
thing
i
liked
for
somehow
i
never
forgot
what
i
had
once
learned
while
my
father
sat
as
he
said
like
a
mere
extension
of
the
instrument
operated
upon
rather
than
listening
as
he
wrote
what
i
then
i
can
not
tell
i
do
believe
i
thought
at
all
i
only
as
a
little
pupil
of
mine
once
said
to
me
when
having
found
her
sitting
with
her
hands
on
her
lap
before
the
piano
i
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
am
only
musicating
she
answered
but
the
enjoyment
was
none
the
less
that
there
was
no
conscious
thought
in
it
other
branches
he
taught
me
himself
and
i
believe
i
got
on
very
fairly
for
my
age
we
lived
then
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
museum
where
i
was
well
known
to
all
the
people
of
the
place
for
i
used
often
to
go
there
and
would
linger
about
looking
at
things
sometimes
for
hours
before
my
father
came
to
me
but
he
always
came
at
the
very
minute
he
had
said
and
always
found
me
at
the
appointed
spot
i
gained
a
great
deal
by
thus
haunting
the
museum
a
great
deal
more
than
i
supposed
at
the
time
one
gain
was
that
i
knew
perfectly
where
in
the
place
any
given
sort
of
thing
was
to
be
found
if
it
were
there
at
all
i
had
unconsciously
learned
something
of
classification
one
afternoon
i
was
waiting
as
usual
but
my
father
did
not
come
at
the
time
appointed
i
waited
on
and
on
till
it
grew
dark
and
the
hour
for
closing
arrived
by
which
time
i
was
in
great
uneasiness
but
i
was
forced
to
go
home
without
him
i
must
hasten
over
this
part
of
my
history
for
even
yet
i
can
scarcely
bear
to
speak
of
it
i
found
that
while
i
was
waiting
he
had
been
seized
with
some
kind
of
fit
in
the
and
had
been
carried
home
and
that
i
was
alone
in
the
world
the
landlady
for
we
only
rented
rooms
in
the
house
was
very
kind
to
me
at
least
until
she
found
that
my
father
had
left
no
money
he
had
then
been
only
reading
for
a
long
time
and
when
i
looked
back
i
could
see
that
he
must
have
been
short
of
money
for
some
weeks
at
least
a
few
bills
coming
in
all
our
little
effects
for
the
furniture
was
our
own
were
sold
without
bringing
sufficient
to
pay
them
the
things
went
for
less
than
half
their
value
in
consequence
i
believe
of
that
conspiracy
of
the
brokers
which
they
call
i
was
especially
miserable
at
losing
my
books
which
although
in
ignorance
i
greatly
valued
more
miserable
even
i
honestly
think
than
at
seeing
my
loved
piano
carried
off
when
the
sale
was
over
and
every
thing
removed
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
amidst
the
dust
and
bits
of
paper
and
straw
and
cord
without
a
single
idea
in
my
head
as
to
what
was
to
become
of
me
or
what
i
was
to
do
next
i
did
cry
that
i
am
sure
of
but
i
doubt
if
in
all
london
there
was
a
more
wretched
child
than
myself
just
then
the
twilight
was
darkening
down
the
twilight
of
a
november
afternoon
of
course
there
was
no
fire
in
the
grate
and
i
had
eaten
nothing
that
day
for
although
the
landlady
had
offered
me
some
dinner
and
i
had
tried
to
please
her
by
taking
some
i
found
i
could
not
swallow
and
had
to
leave
it
while
i
sat
thus
on
the
floor
i
heard
her
come
into
the
room
and
some
one
with
her
but
i
did
not
look
round
and
they
not
seeing
me
and
thinking
i
suppose
that
i
was
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
went
on
talking
about
me
all
i
afterwards
remembered
of
their
conversation
was
some
severe
reflections
on
my
father
and
the
announcement
of
the
decree
that
i
must
go
to
the
workhouse
though
i
knew
nothing
definite
as
to
the
import
of
this
doom
it
filled
me
with
horror
the
moment
they
left
me
alone
to
look
for
me
as
i
supposed
i
got
up
and
walking
as
softly
as
i
could
glided
down
the
stairs
and
unbonneted
and
unwrapped
ran
from
the
house
with
terror
i
had
not
gone
farther
i
fancy
than
a
few
yards
when
i
ran
up
against
some
one
who
laid
hold
of
me
and
asked
me
gruffly
what
i
meant
by
it
i
knew
the
voice
it
was
that
of
an
old
irishwoman
who
did
all
the
little
charing
we
wanted
for
i
kept
the
rooms
tidy
and
the
landlady
cooked
for
us
as
soon
as
she
saw
who
it
was
her
tone
changed
and
then
first
i
broke
out
in
sobs
and
told
her
i
was
running
away
because
they
were
going
to
send
me
to
the
workhouse
she
burst
into
a
torrent
of
irish
indignation
and
assured
me
that
such
should
never
be
my
fate
while
she
lived
i
must
go
back
to
the
house
with
her
she
said
and
get
my
things
and
then
i
should
go
home
with
her
until
something
better
should
turn
up
i
told
her
i
would
go
with
her
anywhere
except
into
that
house
again
and
she
did
not
insist
but
afterwards
went
by
herself
and
got
my
little
wardrobe
in
the
mean
time
she
led
me
away
to
a
large
house
in
a
square
of
which
she
took
the
key
from
her
pocket
to
open
the
door
it
looked
to
me
such
a
huge
place
the
largest
house
i
had
ever
been
in
but
it
was
rather
desolate
for
except
in
one
little
room
below
where
she
had
scarcely
more
than
a
bed
and
a
chair
a
slip
of
carpet
and
a
there
was
not
an
article
of
furniture
in
the
whole
place
she
had
been
put
there
when
the
last
tenant
left
to
take
care
of
the
place
until
another
tenant
should
appear
to
turn
her
out
she
had
her
houseroom
and
a
trifle
a
week
besides
for
her
services
beyond
which
she
depended
entirely
on
what
she
could
make
by
charing
when
she
had
no
house
to
live
in
on
the
same
terms
she
took
a
room
somewhere
here
i
lived
for
several
months
and
was
able
to
be
of
use
for
as
conan
was
bound
to
be
there
at
certain
times
to
show
any
one
over
the
house
who
brought
an
order
from
the
agent
and
this
necessarily
took
up
a
good
part
of
her
working
time
and
as
moreover
i
could
open
the
door
and
walk
about
the
place
as
well
as
another
she
willingly
left
me
in
charge
as
often
as
she
had
a
job
elsewhere
on
such
occasions
however
i
found
it
very
dreary
indeed
for
few
people
called
and
she
would
not
unfrequently
be
absent
the
whole
day
if
i
had
had
my
piano
i
should
have
cared
little
but
i
had
not
a
single
book
except
one
and
what
do
you
think
that
was
an
odd
volume
of
the
newgate
calendar
i
need
hardly
say
that
it
had
not
the
effect
on
me
which
it
is
said
to
have
on
some
of
its
students
it
moved
me
indeed
to
the
profoundest
sympathy
not
with
the
crimes
of
the
malefactors
only
with
the
malefactors
themselves
and
their
mental
condition
after
the
deed
was
actually
done
but
it
was
with
the
fascination
of
a
hopeless
horror
making
me
feel
almost
as
if
i
had
committed
every
crime
as
i
perused
its
tale
that
i
regarded
them
they
were
to
me
like
living
crimes
it
was
not
until
long
afterwards
that
i
was
able
to
understand
that
a
man
actions
are
not
the
man
but
may
be
separated
from
him
that
his
character
even
is
not
the
man
but
may
be
changed
while
he
yet
holds
the
same
individuality
is
the
man
who
was
blind
though
he
now
sees
whence
it
comes
that
the
deeds
continuing
his
all
stain
of
them
may
yet
be
washed
out
of
him
i
did
not
i
say
understand
all
this
until
afterwards
but
i
believe
odd
as
it
may
seem
that
volume
of
the
newgate
calendar
threw
down
the
first
deposit
of
soil
from
which
afterwards
sprung
what
grew
to
be
almost
a
passion
in
me
for
getting
the
people
about
me
clean
a
passion
which
might
have
done
as
much
harm
as
good
if
its
companion
patience
had
not
been
sent
me
to
guide
and
restrain
it
in
a
word
i
came
at
length
to
understand
in
some
measure
the
last
prayer
of
our
lord
for
those
that
crucified
him
and
the
ground
on
which
he
begged
from
his
father
their
forgiveness
that
they
knew
not
what
they
did
if
the
newgate
calendar
was
indeed
the
beginning
of
this
course
of
education
i
need
not
regret
having
lost
my
piano
and
having
that
volume
for
a
while
as
my
only
aid
to
reflection
my
father
had
never
talked
much
to
me
about
religion
but
when
he
did
it
was
with
such
evident
awe
in
his
spirit
and
reverence
in
his
demeanor
as
had
more
effect
on
me
i
am
certain
from
the
very
paucity
of
the
words
in
which
his
meaning
found
utterance
another
thing
which
had
still
more
influence
upon
me
was
that
waking
one
night
after
i
had
been
asleep
for
some
time
i
saw
him
on
his
knees
by
my
bedside
i
did
not
move
or
speak
for
fear
of
disturbing
him
and
indeed
such
an
awe
came
over
me
that
it
would
have
required
a
considerable
effort
of
the
will
for
any
bodily
movement
whatever
when
he
lifted
his
head
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pale
tearful
face
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
virtue
of
the
sight
should
never
have
passed
away
on
sundays
we
went
to
church
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
in
fine
weather
went
out
for
a
walk
or
if
it
were
raining
or
cold
i
played
to
him
till
he
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa
then
in
the
evening
after
tea
we
had
more
music
some
poetry
which
we
read
alternately
and
a
chapter
of
the
new
testament
which
he
always
read
to
me
i
mention
this
to
show
you
that
i
did
not
come
all
unprepared
to
the
study
of
the
newgate
calendar
still
i
can
not
think
that
under
any
circumstances
it
could
have
done
an
innocent
child
harm
even
familiarity
with
vice
is
not
necessarily
pollution
there
can
not
be
many
women
of
my
age
as
familiar
with
it
in
every
shape
as
i
am
and
i
do
not
find
that
i
grow
to
regard
it
with
one
atom
less
of
absolute
abhorrence
although
i
neither
shudder
at
the
mention
of
it
nor
turn
with
disgust
from
the
person
in
whom
it
dwells
but
the
consolations
of
religion
were
not
yet
consciously
mine
i
had
not
yet
begun
to
think
of
god
in
any
relation
to
myself
the
house
was
in
an
old
square
built
i
believe
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
which
although
many
of
the
houses
were
occupied
by
people
had
fallen
far
from
its
first
high
estate
no
one
would
believe
to
look
at
it
from
the
outside
what
a
great
place
it
was
the
whole
of
the
space
behind
it
corresponding
to
the
small
gardens
of
the
other
houses
was
occupied
by
a
large
under
which
was
a
room
of
equal
extent
while
all
under
that
were
cellars
connected
with
the
sunk
story
in
front
by
a
long
vaulted
passage
corresponding
to
a
wooden
gallery
above
which
formed
a
communication
between
the
floor
and
the
most
girls
of
my
age
knowing
these
vast
empty
spaces
about
them
would
have
been
terrified
at
being
left
alone
there
even
in
but
i
was
i
suppose
too
miserable
to
be
frightened
even
the
horrible
facts
of
the
newgate
calendar
did
not
thus
affect
me
not
even
when
conan
was
later
than
usual
and
the
night
came
down
and
i
had
to
sit
perhaps
for
hours
in
the
dark
for
she
would
not
allow
me
to
have
a
candle
for
fear
of
fire
but
you
will
not
wonder
that
i
used
to
cry
a
good
deal
although
i
did
my
best
to
hide
the
traces
of
it
because
i
knew
it
would
annoy
my
kind
old
friend
she
showed
me
a
great
deal
of
rough
tenderness
which
would
not
have
been
rough
had
not
the
natural
grace
of
her
irish
nature
been
injured
by
the
contact
of
many
years
with
the
dull
coarseness
of
the
uneducated
saxon
you
may
be
sure
i
learned
to
love
her
dearly
she
shared
every
thing
with
me
in
the
way
of
eating
and
would
have
shared
also
the
tumbler
of
gin
and
water
with
which
she
generally
ended
the
day
but
something
i
do
know
what
i
believe
a
simple
physical
dislike
made
me
refuse
that
altogether
one
evening
i
have
particular
cause
to
remember
both
for
itself
and
because
of
something
that
followed
many
years
after
i
was
in
the
on
the
first
floor
a
double
room
with
folding
doors
and
a
small
cabinet
behind
communicating
with
a
back
stair
for
the
stairs
were
double
all
through
the
house
adding
much
to
the
of
the
place
as
i
look
back
upon
it
in
my
memory
i
fear
in
describing
the
place
so
minutely
i
may
have
been
rousing
false
expectations
of
an
adventure
but
i
have
a
reason
for
being
rather
minute
though
it
will
not
appear
until
afterwards
i
had
been
looking
out
of
the
window
all
the
afternoon
upon
the
silent
square
for
as
it
was
no
thoroughfare
it
was
only
enlivened
by
the
passing
and
returning
now
and
then
of
a
tradesman
cart
and
as
it
was
winter
there
were
no
children
playing
in
the
garden
it
was
a
rainy
afternoon
a
gray
cloud
of
fog
and
soot
hung
from
the
whole
sky
about
a
score
of
yellow
leaves
yet
quivered
on
the
trees
and
the
statue
of
queen
anne
stood
bleak
and
disconsolate
among
the
bare
branches
i
am
afraid
i
am
getting
but
somehow
that
afternoon
seems
burned
into
me
in
enamel
i
gazed
drearily
without
interest
i
brooded
over
the
past
i
never
at
this
time
so
far
as
i
remember
dreamed
of
looking
forward
i
had
no
hope
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
things
might
grow
better
i
was
dull
and
wretched
i
may
just
say
here
in
passing
that
i
think
this
experience
is
in
a
great
measure
what
has
enabled
me
to
understand
the
peculiar
misery
of
the
poor
in
our
large
towns
they
have
no
hope
no
impulse
to
look
forward
nothing
to
expect
they
live
but
in
the
present
and
the
dreariness
of
that
soon
shapes
the
whole
atmosphere
of
their
spirits
to
its
own
likeness
perhaps
the
first
thing
one
who
would
help
them
has
to
do
is
to
aid
the
birth
of
some
small
vital
hope
in
them
that
is
better
than
a
thousand
gifts
especially
those
of
the
ordinary
kind
which
mostly
do
harm
tending
to
keep
them
what
they
are
a
prey
to
present
and
importunate
wants
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
tired
of
standing
i
sat
down
upon
the
floor
for
there
was
nothing
to
sit
upon
besides
there
i
still
sat
long
after
it
was
quite
dark
all
at
once
a
surge
of
arose
in
my
heart
i
burst
out
wailing
and
sobbing
and
cried
aloud
has
forgotten
me
altogether
the
fact
was
i
had
had
no
dinner
that
day
for
conan
had
expected
to
return
long
before
and
the
piece
of
bread
she
had
given
me
which
was
all
that
was
in
the
house
i
had
eaten
many
hours
ago
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
my
dinner
though
the
want
of
it
may
have
had
to
do
with
this
burst
of
misery
what
i
was
really
thinking
of
was
that
i
could
do
nothing
for
anybody
my
little
ambition
had
always
been
to
be
useful
i
knew
i
was
of
some
use
to
my
father
for
i
kept
the
rooms
tidy
for
him
and
dusted
his
pet
books
oh
so
carefully
for
they
were
like
household
gods
to
me
i
had
also
played
to
him
and
i
knew
he
enjoyed
that
he
said
so
many
times
and
i
had
begun
though
not
long
before
he
left
me
to
think
how
i
should
be
able
to
help
him
better
by
and
by
for
i
saw
that
he
worked
very
hard
so
hard
that
it
made
him
silent
and
i
knew
that
my
made
her
livelihood
partly
at
least
by
giving
lessons
and
i
thought
that
i
might
by
and
by
be
able
to
give
lessons
too
and
then
papa
would
not
require
to
work
so
hard
for
i
too
should
bring
home
money
to
pay
for
what
we
wanted
but
now
i
was
of
use
to
nobody
i
said
and
not
likely
to
become
of
any
i
could
not
even
help
poor
conan
except
by
doing
what
a
child
might
do
just
as
well
as
i
for
i
did
not
earn
a
penny
of
our
living
i
only
gave
the
poor
old
thing
time
to
work
harder
that
i
might
eat
up
her
earnings
what
added
to
the
misery
was
that
i
had
always
thought
of
myself
as
a
lady
for
was
not
papa
a
gentleman
let
him
be
ever
so
poor
shillings
and
sovereigns
in
his
pocket
could
not
determine
whether
a
man
was
a
gentleman
or
not
and
if
he
was
a
gentleman
his
daughter
must
be
a
lady
but
how
could
i
be
a
lady
if
i
was
content
to
be
a
burden
to
a
poor
charwoman
instead
of
earning
my
own
living
and
something
besides
with
which
to
help
her
for
i
had
the
notion
it
came
i
can
not
tell
though
i
know
well
enough
it
came
that
position
depended
on
how
much
a
person
was
able
to
help
other
people
and
here
i
was
useless
worse
than
useless
to
anybody
why
did
not
god
remember
me
if
it
was
only
for
my
father
sake
he
was
worth
something
if
i
was
not
and
i
would
be
worth
something
if
only
i
had
a
chance
am
of
no
use
i
cried
god
has
forgotten
me
altogether
and
i
went
on
weeping
and
moaning
in
my
great
misery
until
i
fell
fast
asleep
on
the
floor
i
have
no
theory
about
dreams
and
visions
and
i
do
know
what
you
walton
may
think
as
to
whether
these
ended
with
the
first
ages
of
the
church
but
surely
if
one
falls
fast
asleep
without
an
idea
in
one
head
and
a
whole
dismal
world
of
misery
in
one
heart
and
wakes
up
quiet
and
refreshed
without
the
misery
and
with
an
idea
there
can
be
no
great
fanaticism
in
thinking
that
the
change
may
have
come
from
somewhere
near
where
the
miracles
lie
in
fact
that
god
may
have
had
something
might
i
not
say
every
thing
to
do
with
it
for
my
part
if
i
were
to
learn
that
he
had
no
hand
in
this
experience
of
mine
i
could
help
losing
all
interest
in
it
and
wishing
that
i
had
died
of
the
misery
which
it
dispelled
certainly
if
it
had
a
physical
source
it
was
that
i
was
more
comfortable
for
i
was
hungrier
than
ever
and
you
may
well
fancy
cold
enough
having
slept
on
the
bare
floor
without
any
thing
to
cover
me
on
christmas
eve
for
christmas
eve
it
was
no
doubt
my
sleep
had
done
me
good
but
i
suspect
the
sleep
came
to
quiet
my
mind
for
the
reception
of
the
new
idea
the
way
conan
kept
christmas
day
as
she
told
me
in
the
morning
was
to
comfort
her
old
bones
in
bed
until
the
afternoon
and
then
to
have
a
good
tea
with
a
chop
after
which
she
said
she
would
have
me
read
the
newgate
calendar
to
her
so
as
soon
as
i
had
washed
up
the
few
breakfast
things
i
asked
if
while
she
lay
in
bed
i
might
not
go
out
for
a
little
while
to
look
for
work
she
laughed
at
the
notion
of
my
being
able
to
do
any
thing
but
did
not
object
to
my
trying
so
i
dressed
myself
as
neatly
as
i
could
and
set
out
there
were
two
narrow
streets
full
of
small
shops
in
which
those
of
predominated
leading
from
the
two
lower
corners
of
the
square
down
into
oxford
street
and
in
a
shop
in
one
of
these
i
was
not
sure
which
i
had
seen
an
old
piano
standing
and
a
girl
of
about
my
own
age
watching
i
found
the
shop
at
last
although
it
was
shut
up
for
i
knew
the
name
and
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
opened
by
a
stout
matron
with
a
not
unfriendly
expression
who
asked
me
what
i
wanted
i
told
her
i
wanted
work
she
seemed
amused
at
the
idea
for
i
was
very
small
for
my
age
then
as
well
as
now
but
apparently
willing
to
have
a
chat
with
me
asked
what
i
could
do
i
told
her
i
could
teach
her
daughter
music
she
asked
me
what
made
me
come
to
her
and
i
told
her
then
she
asked
me
how
much
i
should
charge
i
told
her
that
some
ladies
had
a
guinea
a
lesson
at
which
she
laughed
so
heartily
that
i
had
to
wait
until
the
first
transports
of
her
amusement
were
over
before
i
could
finish
by
saying
that
for
my
part
i
should
be
glad
to
give
an
hour
lesson
for
threepence
only
if
she
pleased
i
should
prefer
it
in
silver
but
how
was
she
to
know
she
asked
that
i
could
teach
her
properly
i
told
her
i
would
let
her
hear
me
play
whereupon
she
led
me
into
the
shop
through
a
back
room
in
which
her
husband
sat
smoking
a
long
pipe
with
a
tankard
at
his
elbow
having
taken
down
a
shutter
she
managed
with
some
difficulty
to
clear
me
a
passage
through
a
crowd
of
furniture
to
the
instrument
and
with
a
struggle
i
squeezed
through
and
reached
it
but
at
the
first
chord
i
struck
i
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
in
some
alarm
she
asked
what
was
the
matter
calling
me
very
kindly
i
told
her
it
was
so
dreadfully
out
of
tune
i
play
upon
it
at
all
but
if
she
would
get
it
tuned
i
should
not
be
long
in
showing
her
that
i
could
do
what
i
professed
she
told
me
she
could
not
afford
to
have
it
tuned
and
if
i
could
not
teach
bertha
on
it
as
it
was
she
could
help
it
this
however
i
assured
her
was
utterly
impossible
upon
which
with
some
show
of
offence
she
reached
over
a
chest
of
drawers
and
shut
down
the
cover
i
believe
she
doubted
whether
i
could
play
at
all
and
had
not
been
merely
amusing
myself
at
her
expense
nothing
was
left
but
to
thank
her
bid
her
and
walk
out
of
the
house
dreadfully
disappointed
unwilling
to
go
home
at
once
i
wandered
about
the
neighborhood
through
street
after
street
until
i
found
myself
in
another
square
with
a
number
of
in
it
one
of
them
that
of
a
firm
at
sight
of
which
a
thought
came
into
my
head
the
next
morning
i
went
in
and
requested
to
see
the
master
the
man
to
whom
i
spoke
stared
no
doubt
but
he
went
and
returning
after
a
little
while
during
which
my
heart
beat
very
fast
invited
me
to
walk
into
the
perkins
was
amused
with
the
story
of
my
attempt
to
procure
teaching
and
its
frustration
if
i
had
asked
him
for
money
to
which
i
do
not
believe
hunger
itself
could
have
driven
me
he
would
probably
have
got
rid
of
me
quickly
enough
and
small
blame
to
him
as
conan
would
have
said
but
to
my
request
that
he
would
spare
a
man
to
tune
lampeter
piano
he
replied
at
once
that
he
would
provided
i
could
satisfy
him
as
to
my
efficiency
thereupon
he
asked
me
a
few
questions
about
music
of
which
some
i
could
answer
and
some
i
could
not
next
he
took
me
into
the
shop
set
me
a
stool
in
front
of
a
grand
piano
and
told
me
to
play
i
could
not
help
trembling
a
good
deal
but
i
tried
my
best
in
a
few
moments
however
the
tears
were
dropping
on
the
keys
and
when
he
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
him
it
was
months
since
i
had
touched
a
piano
the
answer
did
not
however
satisfy
him
he
asked
very
kindly
how
that
was
and
i
had
to
tell
him
my
whole
story
then
he
not
only
promised
to
have
the
piano
tuned
for
me
at
once
but
told
me
that
i
might
go
and
practise
there
as
often
as
i
pleased
so
long
as
i
was
a
good
girl
and
did
not
take
up
with
bad
company
imagine
my
delight
then
he
sent
for
a
tuner
and
i
suppose
told
him
a
little
about
me
for
the
man
spoke
very
kindly
to
me
as
we
went
to
the
broker
perkins
has
been
a
good
friend
to
me
ever
since
for
six
months
i
continued
to
give
bertha
lampeter
lessons
they
were
broken
off
only
when
she
went
to
a
dressmaker
to
learn
her
business
but
her
mother
had
by
that
time
introduced
me
to
several
families
of
her
acquaintance
amongst
whom
i
found
five
or
six
pupils
on
the
same
terms
by
this
teaching
if
i
earned
little
i
learned
much
and
every
day
almost
i
practised
at
the
when
the
house
was
let
conan
took
a
room
in
the
neighborhood
that
i
might
keep
up
my
connection
she
said
then
first
i
was
introduced
to
scenes
and
experiences
with
which
i
am
now
familiar
percivale
might
well
recoil
if
i
were
to
tell
her
half
the
wretchedness
wickedness
and
vulgarity
i
have
seen
and
often
had
to
encounter
for
two
years
or
so
we
changed
about
at
one
time
in
an
empty
house
at
another
in
a
hired
room
sometimes
better
sometimes
worse
off
as
regarded
our
neighbors
until
conan
having
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
confine
herself
to
charing
we
at
last
settled
down
here
where
i
have
now
lived
for
many
years
you
may
be
inclined
to
ask
why
i
had
not
kept
up
my
acquaintance
with
my
i
believe
the
shock
of
losing
my
father
and
the
misery
that
followed
made
me
feel
as
if
my
former
world
had
vanished
at
all
events
i
never
thought
of
going
to
her
until
perkins
one
day
after
listening
to
something
i
was
playing
asked
me
who
had
taught
me
and
this
brought
her
back
to
my
mind
so
vividly
that
i
resolved
to
go
and
see
her
she
welcomed
me
with
more
than
kindness
with
tenderness
and
told
me
i
had
caused
her
much
uneasiness
by
not
letting
her
know
what
had
become
of
me
she
looked
quite
aghast
when
she
learned
in
what
sort
of
place
and
with
whom
i
lived
but
i
told
her
conan
had
saved
me
from
the
workhouse
and
was
as
much
of
a
mother
to
me
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
be
that
we
loved
each
other
and
that
it
would
be
very
wrong
of
me
to
leave
her
now
especially
that
she
was
not
so
well
as
she
had
been
and
i
believe
she
then
saw
the
thing
as
i
saw
it
she
made
me
play
to
her
was
pleased
indeed
surprised
until
i
told
her
how
i
had
been
supporting
myself
and
insisted
on
my
resuming
my
studies
with
her
which
i
was
only
too
glad
to
do
i
now
of
course
got
on
much
faster
and
she
expressed
satisfaction
with
my
progress
but
continued
manifestly
uneasy
at
the
kind
of
thing
i
had
to
encounter
and
become
of
necessity
more
and
more
familiar
with
when
conan
fell
ill
i
had
indeed
hard
work
of
it
unlike
most
of
her
class
she
had
laid
by
a
trifle
of
money
but
as
soon
as
she
ceased
to
add
to
it
it
began
to
dwindle
and
was
very
soon
gone
do
what
i
could
for
a
while
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
kindness
of
the
neighbors
i
should
sometimes
have
been
in
want
of
bread
and
when
i
hear
hard
things
said
of
the
poor
i
often
think
that
surely
improvidence
is
not
so
bad
as
selfishness
but
of
course
there
are
all
sorts
amongst
them
just
as
there
are
all
sorts
in
every
class
when
i
went
out
to
teach
now
one
now
another
of
the
women
in
the
house
would
take
charge
of
my
friend
and
when
i
came
home
except
her
guardian
happened
to
have
got
tipsy
i
never
found
she
had
been
neglected
miss
harper
said
i
must
raise
my
terms
but
i
told
her
that
would
be
the
loss
of
my
pupils
then
she
said
she
must
see
what
could
be
done
for
me
only
no
one
she
knew
was
likely
to
employ
a
child
like
me
if
i
were
able
to
teach
ever
so
well
one
morning
however
within
a
week
a
note
came
from
lady
bernard
asking
me
to
go
and
see
her
i
went
and
found
a
mother
you
do
not
know
her
i
think
but
you
must
one
day
good
people
like
you
must
come
together
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
her
she
awed
me
at
first
and
i
could
hardly
speak
to
her
i
was
not
much
more
than
thirteen
then
but
with
the
awe
came
a
certain
confidence
which
was
far
better
than
ease
the
immediate
result
was
that
she
engaged
me
to
go
and
play
for
an
hour
five
days
a
week
at
a
certain
hospital
for
sick
children
in
the
neighborhood
which
she
partly
supported
for
she
had
a
strong
belief
that
there
was
in
music
a
great
healing
power
her
theory
was
that
all
healing
energy
operates
first
on
the
mind
and
from
it
passes
to
the
body
and
that
medicines
render
aid
only
by
removing
certain
physical
obstacles
to
the
healing
force
she
believes
that
when
music
operating
on
the
mind
has
procured
the
peace
of
harmony
the
peace
in
its
turn
operates
outward
reducing
the
vital
powers
also
into
the
harmonious
action
of
health
there
may
be
in
it
i
can
not
tell
but
i
do
think
that
good
has
been
and
is
the
result
of
my
playing
to
those
children
for
i
go
still
though
not
quite
so
often
and
it
is
music
to
me
to
watch
my
music
thrown
back
in
light
from
some
of
those
sweet
pale
suffering
faces
she
was
too
wise
to
pay
me
much
for
it
at
first
she
inquired
before
making
me
the
offer
how
much
i
was
already
earning
asked
me
upon
how
much
i
could
support
conan
and
myself
comfortably
and
then
made
the
sum
of
my
weekly
earnings
up
to
that
amount
at
the
same
time
however
she
sent
many
things
to
warm
and
feed
the
old
woman
so
that
my
mind
was
set
at
ease
about
her
she
got
a
good
deal
better
for
a
while
but
continued
to
suffer
so
much
from
rheumatism
that
she
was
quite
unfit
to
go
out
charing
any
more
and
i
would
not
hear
of
her
again
exposing
herself
to
the
damps
and
draughts
of
empty
houses
so
long
as
i
was
able
to
provide
for
her
of
which
ability
you
may
be
sure
i
was
not
a
little
proud
at
first
i
have
been
talking
for
a
long
time
and
yet
may
seem
to
have
said
nothing
to
account
for
your
finding
me
where
she
left
me
but
i
will
try
to
come
to
the
point
as
quickly
as
possible
before
she
was
entirely
laid
up
we
had
removed
to
this
place
a
rough
shelter
but
far
less
so
than
some
of
the
houses
in
which
we
had
been
i
remember
one
in
which
i
used
to
dart
up
and
down
like
a
hunted
hare
at
one
time
at
another
to
steal
along
from
stair
to
stair
like
a
ghost
afraid
of
frightening
people
my
mode
of
procedure
depending
in
part
on
the
time
of
day
and
which
of
the
inhabitants
i
had
reason
to
dread
meeting
it
was
a
good
while
before
the
inmates
of
this
house
and
i
began
to
know
each
other
the
landlord
had
turned
out
the
former
tenant
of
this
garret
after
she
had
been
long
enough
in
the
house
for
all
the
rest
to
know
her
and
notwithstanding
she
had
been
no
great
favorite
they
all
took
her
part
against
the
landlord
and
fancying
perhaps
because
we
kept
more
to
ourselves
that
we
were
his
and
that
he
had
turned
out
muggy
moll
as
they
called
her
to
make
room
for
us
regarded
us
from
the
first
with
disapprobation
the
little
girls
would
make
grimaces
at
me
and
the
bigger
girls
would
pull
my
hair
slap
my
face
and
even
occasionally
push
me
down
stairs
while
the
boys
made
themselves
far
more
terrible
in
my
eyes
but
some
remark
happening
to
be
dropped
one
day
which
led
the
landlord
to
disclaim
all
previous
knowledge
of
us
things
began
to
grow
better
and
this
is
not
by
any
means
one
of
the
worst
parts
of
london
i
could
take
walton
to
houses
in
the
east
end
where
the
manners
are
indescribable
we
are
all
earning
our
bread
here
some
have
an
occasional
attack
of
drunkenness
and
idle
about
but
they
are
sick
of
it
again
after
a
while
i
remember
asking
a
woman
once
if
her
husband
would
be
present
at
a
little
entertainment
to
which
lady
bernard
had
invited
them
she
answered
that
he
would
be
there
if
he
was
drunk
but
if
he
was
sober
he
spare
the
time
very
soon
they
began
to
ask
me
after
conan
and
one
day
i
invited
one
of
them
who
seemed
a
decent
though
not
very
tidy
woman
to
walk
up
and
see
her
for
i
was
anxious
she
should
have
a
visitor
now
and
then
when
i
was
out
as
she
complained
a
good
deal
of
the
loneliness
the
woman
consented
and
ever
after
was
very
kind
to
her
but
my
main
stay
and
comfort
was
an
old
woman
who
then
occupied
the
room
opposite
to
this
she
was
such
a
good
creature
nearly
blind
she
yet
kept
her
room
the
very
pink
of
neatness
i
never
saw
a
speck
of
dust
on
that
chest
of
drawers
which
was
hers
then
and
which
she
valued
far
more
than
many
a
rich
man
values
the
house
of
his
ancestors
not
only
because
it
had
been
her
mother
but
because
it
bore
testimony
to
the
respectability
of
her
family
her
floor
and
her
little
muslin
her
bed
and
every
thing
about
her
were
as
clean
as
lady
could
desire
she
objected
to
move
into
a
better
room
below
which
the
landlord
kindly
offered
her
for
she
was
a
favorite
from
having
been
his
tenant
a
long
time
and
never
having
given
him
any
trouble
in
collecting
her
rent
on
the
ground
that
there
were
two
windows
in
it
and
therefore
too
much
light
for
her
bits
of
furniture
they
would
she
said
look
nothing
in
that
room
she
was
very
pleased
when
i
asked
her
to
pay
a
visit
to
conan
and
as
she
belonged
to
a
far
higher
intellectual
grade
than
my
protectress
and
as
she
had
a
strong
practical
sense
of
religion
chiefly
manifested
in
a
willing
acceptance
of
the
decrees
of
providence
i
think
she
did
us
both
good
i
wish
i
could
draw
you
a
picture
of
her
coming
in
at
that
door
with
her
all
but
sightless
eyes
the
broad
borders
of
her
white
cap
waving
and
her
hands
stretched
out
before
her
for
she
was
more
apprehensive
than
if
she
had
been
quite
blind
because
she
could
see
things
without
knowing
what
or
even
in
what
position
they
were
the
most
remarkable
thing
to
me
was
the
calmness
with
which
she
looked
forward
to
her
approaching
death
although
without
the
expectation
which
so
many
good
people
seem
to
have
in
connection
with
their
departure
i
talked
to
her
about
it
more
than
once
not
with
any
presumption
of
teaching
her
for
i
felt
she
was
far
before
me
but
just
to
find
out
how
she
felt
and
what
she
believed
her
answer
amounted
to
this
that
she
had
never
known
beforehand
what
lay
round
the
next
corner
or
what
was
going
to
happen
to
her
for
if
providence
had
meant
her
to
know
it
could
not
be
by
going
to
as
some
of
the
neighbors
did
but
that
she
always
found
things
turn
out
right
and
good
for
her
and
she
did
not
doubt
she
would
find
it
so
when
she
came
to
the
last
turn
by
degrees
i
knew
everybody
in
the
house
and
of
course
i
was
ready
to
do
what
i
could
to
help
any
of
them
i
had
much
to
lift
me
into
a
higher
region
of
mental
comfort
than
was
open
to
them
for
i
had
music
and
lady
bernard
lent
me
books
of
course
also
i
kept
my
rooms
as
clean
and
tidy
as
i
could
and
indeed
if
i
had
been
more
carelessly
inclined
in
that
way
the
sight
of
the
blind
woman
would
have
been
a
constant
reminder
to
me
by
degrees
also
i
was
able
to
get
a
few
more
articles
of
furniture
for
it
and
a
bit
of
carpet
to
put
down
before
the
fire
i
whitewashed
the
walls
myself
and
after
a
while
began
to
whitewash
the
walls
of
the
landing
as
well
and
all
down
the
stair
which
was
not
of
much
use
to
the
eye
for
there
is
no
light
before
long
some
of
the
other
tenants
began
to
whitewash
their
rooms
also
and
contrive
to
keep
things
a
little
tidier
others
declared
they
had
no
opinion
of
such
uppish
notions
they
were
for
the
likes
of
them
these
were
generally
such
as
would
rejoice
in
wearing
finery
picked
up
at
the
but
even
some
of
them
began
by
degrees
to
cultivate
a
small
measure
of
order
soon
this
one
and
that
began
to
apply
to
me
for
help
in
various
difficulties
that
arose
but
they
did
begin
to
call
me
grannie
for
a
long
time
after
this
they
used
then
to
call
the
blind
woman
grannie
and
the
name
got
associated
with
the
top
of
the
house
and
i
came
to
be
associated
with
it
because
i
also
lived
there
and
we
were
friends
after
her
death
it
was
used
from
habit
at
first
with
a
feeling
of
mistake
seeing
its
immediate
owner
was
gone
but
by
degrees
it
settled
down
upon
me
and
i
came
to
be
called
grannie
by
everybody
in
the
house
even
conan
would
not
unfrequently
address
me
and
speak
of
me
too
as
grannie
at
first
with
a
laugh
but
soon
as
a
matter
of
course
i
got
by
and
by
a
few
pupils
amongst
tradespeople
of
a
class
rather
superior
to
that
in
which
i
had
begun
to
teach
and
from
whom
i
could
ask
and
obtain
double
my
former
fee
so
that
things
grew
with
fluctuations
gradually
better
lady
bernard
continued
a
true
friend
to
me
but
she
never
was
other
than
that
to
any
some
of
her
friends
ventured
on
the
experiment
whether
i
could
teach
their
children
and
it
is
no
wonder
if
they
were
satisfied
seeing
i
had
myself
such
a
teacher
having
come
once
or
twice
to
see
conan
she
discovered
that
we
were
gaining
a
little
influence
over
the
people
in
the
house
and
it
occurred
to
her
as
she
told
me
afterwards
that
the
virtue
of
music
might
be
tried
there
with
a
end
in
view
hence
it
came
that
i
was
beyond
measure
astonished
and
delighted
one
evening
by
the
arrival
of
a
piano
not
that
one
for
it
got
more
worn
than
i
liked
and
i
was
able
afterwards
to
exchange
it
for
a
better
i
found
it
an
invaluable
aid
in
the
endeavor
to
work
out
my
glowing
desire
of
getting
the
people
about
me
into
a
better
condition
first
i
asked
some
of
the
children
to
come
and
listen
while
i
played
everybody
knows
how
fond
the
least
educated
children
are
of
music
and
i
feel
assured
of
its
elevating
power
whatever
the
may
be
to
poets
and
mathematicians
they
are
certainly
a
godsend
to
the
children
of
our
courts
and
alleys
the
music
takes
possession
of
them
at
once
and
sets
them
moving
to
it
with
rhythmical
grace
i
should
have
been
very
sorry
to
make
it
a
condition
with
those
i
invited
that
they
should
sit
still
to
take
from
them
their
personal
share
in
it
would
have
been
to
destroy
half
the
charm
of
the
thing
a
far
higher
development
is
needful
before
music
can
be
enjoyed
in
silence
and
motionlessness
the
only
condition
i
made
was
that
they
should
come
with
clean
hands
and
faces
and
with
tidy
hair
considerable
indignation
was
at
first
manifested
on
the
part
of
those
parents
whose
children
i
refused
to
admit
because
they
had
neglected
the
condition
this
necessity
however
did
not
often
occur
and
the
anger
passed
away
while
the
condition
gathered
weight
after
a
while
guided
by
what
some
of
the
children
let
fall
i
began
to
invite
the
mothers
to
join
them
and
at
length
it
came
to
be
understood
that
every
saturday
evening
whoever
chose
to
make
herself
tidy
would
be
welcome
to
an
hour
or
two
of
my
music
some
of
the
husbands
next
began
to
come
but
there
were
never
so
many
of
them
present
i
may
just
add
that
although
the
manners
of
some
of
my
audience
would
be
very
shocking
to
cultivated
people
and
i
understand
perfectly
how
they
must
be
so
i
am
very
rarely
annoyed
on
such
occasions
i
must
now
glance
at
another
point
in
my
history
one
on
which
i
can
not
dwell
never
since
my
father
death
had
i
attended
public
worship
nothing
had
drawn
me
thither
and
i
hardly
know
what
induced
me
one
evening
to
step
into
a
chapel
of
which
i
knew
nothing
there
was
not
even
sunday
to
account
for
it
i
believe
however
it
had
to
do
with
this
that
all
day
i
had
been
feeling
tired
i
think
people
are
often
ready
to
suppose
that
their
bodily
condition
is
the
cause
of
their
spiritual
discomfort
when
it
may
be
only
the
occasion
upon
which
some
inward
lack
reveals
itself
that
the
spiritual
nature
should
be
incapable
of
meeting
and
sustaining
the
body
in
its
troubles
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
show
that
it
is
not
in
a
satisfactory
condition
for
a
long
time
the
struggle
for
mere
existence
had
almost
absorbed
my
energies
but
things
had
been
easier
for
some
time
and
a
had
at
length
come
it
was
not
that
i
could
lay
any
thing
definite
to
my
own
charge
i
only
felt
empty
all
through
i
felt
that
something
was
not
right
with
me
that
something
was
required
of
me
which
i
was
not
rendering
i
could
not
however
have
told
you
what
it
was
possibly
the
feeling
had
been
for
some
time
growing
but
that
day
so
far
as
i
can
tell
i
was
first
aware
of
it
and
i
presume
it
was
the
dim
cause
of
my
turning
at
the
sound
of
a
few
singing
voices
and
entering
that
chapel
i
found
about
a
dozen
people
present
something
in
the
air
of
the
place
meagre
and
waste
as
it
looked
yet
induced
me
to
remain
an
address
followed
from
a
man
of
middle
age
who
had
no
gift
of
person
voice
or
utterance
to
recommend
what
he
said
but
there
dwelt
a
more
powerful
enforcement
in
him
than
any
of
those
that
of
earnestness
i
went
again
and
again
and
slowly
i
can
not
well
explain
how
the
sense
of
life
and
its
majesty
grew
upon
me
walton
will
i
trust
understand
me
when
i
say
that
to
one
hungering
for
bread
it
is
of
little
consequence
in
what
sort
of
platter
it
is
handed
him
this
was
a
dissenting
chapel
of
what
order
it
was
long
before
i
knew
and
my
predilection
was
for
the
those
to
which
my
father
had
accustomed
me
but
any
comparison
of
the
two
to
the
prejudice
of
either
i
should
still
although
a
communicant
of
the
church
of
england
regard
with
absolute
indifference
it
will
be
sufficient
for
my
present
purpose
to
allude
to
the
one
practical
thought
which
was
the
main
fruit
i
gathered
from
this
good
man
the
fruit
by
which
i
know
that
he
was
good
footnote
something
like
this
is
the
interpretation
of
the
word
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
given
by
maurice
an
interpretation
which
opens
it
was
this
that
if
all
the
labor
of
god
as
my
teacher
said
was
to
bring
sons
into
glory
lifting
them
out
of
the
abyss
of
evil
bondage
up
to
the
rock
of
his
pure
freedom
the
only
worthy
end
of
life
must
be
to
work
in
the
same
direction
to
be
a
with
god
might
i
not
then
do
something
such
in
my
small
way
and
lose
no
jot
of
my
labor
i
thought
the
urging
the
hope
grew
in
me
but
i
was
not
left
to
feel
blindly
after
some
new
and
unknown
method
of
labor
my
teacher
taught
me
that
the
way
for
to
help
others
was
not
to
tell
them
their
duty
but
myself
to
learn
of
him
who
bore
our
griefs
and
carried
our
sorrows
as
i
learned
of
him
i
should
be
able
to
help
them
i
have
never
had
any
theory
but
just
to
be
their
friend
to
do
for
them
the
best
i
can
when
i
feel
i
may
i
tell
them
what
has
done
me
good
but
i
never
urge
any
belief
of
mine
upon
their
acceptance
it
will
now
seem
no
more
wonderful
to
you
than
to
me
that
i
should
remain
where
i
am
i
simply
have
no
choice
i
was
sixteen
when
conan
died
then
my
friends
amongst
whom
lady
bernard
and
miss
harper
have
ever
been
first
expected
me
to
remove
to
lodgings
in
another
neighborhood
indeed
lady
bernard
came
to
see
me
and
said
she
knew
precisely
the
place
for
me
when
i
told
her
i
should
remain
where
i
was
she
was
silent
and
soon
left
me
i
thought
offended
i
wrote
to
her
at
once
explaining
why
i
chose
my
part
here
saying
that
i
would
not
hastily
alter
any
thing
that
had
been
appointed
me
that
i
loved
the
people
that
they
called
me
grannie
that
they
came
to
me
with
their
troubles
that
there
were
few
changes
in
the
house
now
that
the
sick
looked
to
me
for
help
and
the
children
for
teaching
that
they
seemed
to
be
steadily
rising
in
the
moral
scale
that
i
knew
some
of
them
were
trying
hard
to
be
good
and
i
put
it
to
her
whether
if
i
were
to
leave
them
in
order
merely
as
servants
say
to
better
myself
i
should
not
be
forsaking
my
post
almost
my
family
for
i
knew
it
would
not
be
to
better
either
myself
or
my
friends
if
i
was
at
all
necessary
to
them
i
knew
they
were
yet
more
necessary
to
me
i
have
a
burning
desire
to
help
in
the
making
of
the
world
clean
if
it
be
only
by
sweeping
one
little
room
in
it
i
want
to
lead
some
poor
stray
sheep
home
not
home
to
the
church
walton
i
would
not
be
supposed
to
curry
favor
with
you
i
never
think
of
what
they
call
the
church
i
only
care
to
lead
them
home
to
the
bosom
of
god
where
alone
man
is
true
man
i
could
talk
to
you
till
night
about
what
lady
bernard
has
been
to
me
since
and
what
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
grandchildren
but
i
have
said
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that
i
am
in
such
a
questionable
position
i
fear
i
have
been
guilty
of
much
egotism
and
have
shown
my
personal
feelings
with
too
little
reserve
but
i
cast
myself
on
your
mercy
chapter
xx
a
remarkable
fact
a
silence
followed
i
need
hardly
say
we
had
listened
intently
during
the
story
my
father
had
scarcely
interrupted
the
narrator
i
had
not
spoken
a
word
she
had
throughout
maintained
a
certain
almost
cold
style
no
doubt
because
she
was
herself
the
subject
of
her
story
but
we
could
read
between
the
lines
imagine
much
she
did
not
say
and
supply
color
when
she
gave
only
outline
and
it
moved
us
both
deeply
my
father
sat
perfectly
composed
betraying
his
emotion
in
silence
alone
for
myself
i
had
a
great
lump
in
my
throat
but
in
part
from
the
shame
which
mingled
with
my
admiration
the
silence
had
not
lasted
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
i
yielded
to
a
struggling
impulse
rose
and
kneeling
before
her
put
my
hands
on
her
knees
said
forgive
me
and
could
say
no
more
she
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
whispered
my
dear
mrs
percivale
bent
down
her
face
and
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
how
could
you
help
being
shy
of
me
she
said
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
come
to
you
and
explained
it
all
but
i
shrink
from
at
least
before
a
fit
opportunity
makes
it
comparatively
easy
that
is
the
way
to
give
it
all
its
force
remarked
my
father
i
suppose
it
may
be
she
returned
but
i
hate
talking
about
myself
it
is
an
unpleasant
subject
most
people
do
not
find
it
such
said
my
father
i
could
not
honestly
say
that
i
do
not
enjoy
talking
of
my
own
experiences
of
life
but
there
are
differences
you
see
she
rejoined
my
history
looks
to
me
such
a
matter
of
course
such
a
something
i
could
not
help
or
have
avoided
if
i
would
that
the
telling
of
it
is
unpleasant
because
it
implies
an
importance
which
does
not
belong
to
it
paul
says
something
of
the
same
sort
that
a
necessity
of
preaching
the
gospel
was
laid
upon
him
remarked
my
father
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
on
miss
clare
for
she
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
you
see
walton
it
is
not
in
the
least
as
if
living
in
comfort
i
had
taken
notice
of
the
misery
of
the
poor
for
the
want
of
such
sympathy
and
help
as
i
could
give
them
and
had
therefore
gone
to
live
amongst
them
that
i
might
so
help
them
it
is
quite
different
from
that
if
i
had
done
so
i
might
be
in
danger
of
magnifying
not
merely
my
office
but
myself
on
the
contrary
i
have
been
trained
to
it
in
such
slow
and
necessitous
ways
that
it
would
be
a
far
greater
trial
to
me
to
forsake
my
work
than
it
has
ever
been
to
continue
it
my
father
said
no
more
but
i
knew
he
had
his
own
thoughts
i
remained
kneeling
and
felt
for
the
first
time
as
if
i
understood
what
had
led
to
wo
you
sit
mrs
percivale
she
said
as
if
merely
expostulating
with
me
for
not
making
myself
comfortable
have
you
forgiven
me
i
asked
how
can
i
say
i
have
when
i
never
had
any
thing
to
forgive
well
then
i
must
go
unforgiven
for
i
can
not
forgive
myself
i
said
o
percivale
if
you
think
how
the
world
is
flooded
with
forgiveness
you
will
just
dip
in
your
cup
and
take
what
you
want
i
felt
that
i
was
making
too
much
even
of
my
own
shame
rose
humbled
and
took
my
former
seat
narration
being
over
and
my
father
theory
now
permitting
him
to
ask
questions
he
did
so
plentifully
bringing
out
many
lights
and
elucidating
several
obscurities
the
story
grew
upon
me
until
the
work
to
which
miss
clare
had
given
herself
seemed
more
like
that
of
the
son
of
god
than
any
other
i
knew
for
she
was
not
helping
her
friends
from
afar
but
as
one
of
themselves
nor
with
money
but
with
herself
she
was
not
condescending
to
them
but
finding
her
highest
life
in
companionship
with
them
it
seemed
at
least
more
like
what
his
life
must
have
been
before
he
was
thirty
than
any
thing
else
i
could
think
of
i
held
my
peace
however
for
i
felt
that
to
hint
at
such
a
thought
would
have
greatly
shocked
and
pained
her
no
doubt
the
narrative
i
have
given
is
plainer
and
more
coherent
for
the
questions
my
father
put
but
it
loses
much
from
the
omission
of
one
or
two
parts
which
she
gave
dramatically
with
evident
enjoyment
of
the
fun
that
was
in
them
i
have
also
omitted
all
the
interruptions
which
came
from
her
not
unfrequent
reference
to
my
father
on
points
that
came
up
at
length
i
ventured
to
remind
her
of
something
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
when
you
were
telling
us
miss
clare
i
said
of
the
help
that
came
to
you
that
dreary
afternoon
in
the
empty
house
i
think
you
mentioned
that
something
which
happened
afterwards
made
it
still
more
remarkable
oh
yes
she
answered
i
forgot
about
that
i
did
not
carry
my
history
far
enough
to
be
reminded
of
it
again
somewhere
about
five
years
ago
lady
bernard
having
several
schemes
on
foot
for
helping
such
people
as
i
was
interested
in
asked
me
if
it
would
not
be
nice
to
give
an
entertainment
to
my
friends
and
as
many
of
the
neighbors
as
i
pleased
to
the
number
of
about
a
hundred
she
wanted
to
put
the
thing
entirely
in
my
hands
and
it
should
be
my
entertainment
she
claiming
only
the
privilege
of
defraying
expenses
i
told
her
i
should
be
delighted
to
convey
invitation
but
that
the
entertainment
must
not
pretend
to
be
mine
which
besides
that
it
would
be
a
falsehood
and
therefore
not
to
be
thought
of
would
perplex
my
friends
and
drive
them
to
the
conclusion
either
that
it
was
not
mine
or
that
i
lived
amongst
them
under
false
appearances
she
confessed
the
force
of
my
arguments
and
let
me
have
it
my
own
way
she
had
bought
a
large
house
to
be
a
home
for
young
women
out
of
employment
and
in
it
she
proposed
the
entertainment
should
be
given
there
were
a
good
many
nice
young
women
inmates
at
the
time
who
she
said
would
be
all
willing
to
help
us
to
wait
upon
our
guests
the
idea
was
carried
out
and
the
thing
succeeded
admirably
we
had
music
and
games
the
latter
such
as
the
children
were
mostly
acquainted
with
only
producing
more
merriment
and
conducted
with
more
propriety
than
were
usual
in
the
court
or
the
streets
i
may
just
remark
in
passing
that
had
these
been
children
of
the
poorest
sort
we
should
have
had
to
teach
them
for
one
of
the
saddest
things
is
that
such
in
london
at
least
do
not
know
how
to
play
we
had
tea
and
coffee
and
biscuits
in
the
lower
rooms
for
any
who
pleased
and
they
were
to
have
a
solid
supper
afterwards
with
none
of
the
arrangements
however
had
i
any
thing
to
do
for
my
business
was
to
be
with
them
and
help
them
to
enjoy
themselves
all
went
on
capitally
the
parents
entering
into
the
merriment
of
their
children
and
helping
to
keep
it
up
in
one
of
the
games
i
was
seated
on
the
floor
with
a
handkerchief
tied
over
my
eyes
waiting
i
believe
for
some
gentle
trick
to
be
played
upon
me
that
i
might
guess
at
the
name
of
the
person
who
played
it
there
was
a
delay
of
only
a
few
seconds
long
enough
however
for
a
sudden
return
of
that
dreary
november
afternoon
in
which
i
sat
on
the
floor
too
miserable
even
to
think
that
i
was
cold
and
hungry
strange
to
say
it
was
not
the
picture
of
it
that
came
back
to
me
first
but
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
calling
aloud
in
the
ringing
echo
of
the
desolate
rooms
that
i
was
of
no
use
to
anybody
and
that
god
had
forgotten
me
utterly
with
the
recollection
a
doubtful
expectation
arose
which
moved
me
to
a
scarce
controllable
degree
i
jumped
to
my
feet
and
tore
the
bandage
from
my
eyes
several
times
during
the
evening
i
had
had
the
odd
yet
feeling
of
the
same
thing
having
happened
before
but
i
was
too
busy
entertaining
my
friends
to
try
to
account
for
it
perhaps
what
followed
may
suggest
the
theory
that
in
not
a
few
of
such
cases
the
indistinct
remembrance
of
the
previous
occurrence
of
some
portion
of
the
circumstances
may
cast
the
hue
of
memory
over
the
whole
as
my
eyes
blinded
with
the
light
and
straining
to
recover
themselves
i
stared
about
the
room
the
presentiment
grew
almost
conviction
that
it
was
the
very
room
in
which
i
had
so
sat
in
desolation
and
despair
unable
to
restrain
myself
i
hurried
into
the
back
room
there
was
the
cabinet
beyond
in
a
few
moments
more
i
was
absolutely
satisfied
that
this
was
indeed
the
house
in
which
i
had
first
found
refuge
for
a
time
i
could
take
no
further
share
in
what
was
going
on
but
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
cried
for
joy
some
one
went
for
lady
bernard
who
was
superintending
the
arrangements
for
supper
in
the
behind
she
came
in
alarm
i
told
her
there
was
nothing
the
matter
but
a
little
too
much
happiness
and
if
she
would
come
into
the
cabinet
i
would
tell
her
all
about
it
she
did
so
and
a
few
words
made
her
a
hearty
sharer
in
my
pleasure
she
insisted
that
i
should
tell
the
company
all
about
it
she
said
do
not
know
how
much
it
may
help
some
poor
creature
to
trust
in
god
i
promised
i
would
if
i
found
i
could
command
myself
sufficiently
she
left
me
alone
for
a
little
while
and
after
that
i
was
able
to
join
in
the
games
again
at
supper
i
found
myself
quite
composed
and
at
lady
bernard
request
stood
up
and
gave
them
all
a
little
sketch
of
grannie
history
of
which
sketch
what
had
happened
that
evening
was
made
the
central
point
many
of
the
simpler
hearts
about
me
received
it
without
question
as
a
divine
arrangement
for
my
comfort
and
encouragement
at
least
thus
i
interpreted
their
looks
to
each
other
and
the
remarks
that
reached
my
ear
but
presently
a
man
stood
up
one
who
thought
more
than
the
rest
of
them
perhaps
because
he
was
blind
a
man
at
once
conceited
honest
and
sceptical
and
silence
having
been
made
for
him
and
gentlemen
he
began
as
if
he
had
been
addressing
a
public
meeting
all
heard
what
grannie
has
said
it
very
kind
of
her
to
give
us
so
much
of
her
history
it
a
very
remarkable
one
think
and
she
deserves
to
have
it
as
to
what
upset
her
this
very
night
as
is
and
i
must
say
for
her
i
knowed
her
now
for
six
years
and
i
never
knowed
upset
afore
and
as
to
what
upset
her
all
i
can
say
is
it
may
or
may
not
been
what
phylosophers
call
a
coincydence
but
at
the
same
time
if
it
was
a
coincydence
and
if
the
almighty
had
a
hand
in
it
it
were
no
more
than
you
might
expect
he
would
look
at
it
in
this
light
you
see
that
maybe
she
was
wrong
to
fancy
herself
so
down
on
her
luck
as
all
that
but
she
was
a
good
soul
notwithstandin
and
he
would
let
her
know
he
forgotten
her
and
so
he
set
her
down
in
that
room
there
wi
her
eyes
like
them
here
o
mine
as
never
was
no
manner
o
use
to
me
for
a
minute
jest
to
put
her
in
mind
o
what
had
been
and
what
she
had
said
there
how
it
was
all
so
different
now
in
my
opinion
it
were
no
wonder
as
she
broke
down
god
bless
her
i
beg
leave
to
propose
her
health
so
they
drank
my
health
in
lemonade
and
for
we
were
afraid
to
give
some
of
them
stronger
drink
than
that
and
therefore
had
none
then
we
had
more
music
and
singing
and
a
clergyman
who
knew
how
to
be
neighbor
to
them
that
had
fallen
among
thieves
read
a
short
chapter
and
a
collect
or
two
and
said
a
few
words
to
them
then
grannie
and
her
children
went
home
together
all
happy
but
grannie
the
happiest
of
them
all
strange
and
beautiful
said
my
father
but
he
added
after
a
pause
you
must
have
met
with
many
strange
and
beautiful
things
in
such
a
life
as
yours
for
it
seems
to
me
that
such
a
life
is
open
to
the
entrance
of
all
simple
wonders
conventionality
and
routine
and
arbitrary
law
banish
their
very
approach
i
believe
said
miss
clare
that
every
life
has
its
own
private
experience
of
the
strange
and
beautiful
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
perhaps
god
took
pains
to
bar
out
such
things
of
the
sort
as
we
should
be
no
better
for
the
reason
why
lazarus
was
not
allowed
to
visit
the
brothers
of
dives
was
that
the
repentance
he
would
have
urged
would
not
have
followed
and
they
would
have
been
only
the
worse
in
consequence
admirably
said
remarked
my
father
before
we
took
our
leave
i
had
engaged
miss
clare
to
dine
with
us
while
my
father
was
in
town
chapter
xxi
lady
bernard
when
she
came
we
had
no
other
guest
and
so
had
plenty
of
talk
with
her
before
dinner
i
showed
her
my
husband
pictures
and
she
was
especially
pleased
with
that
which
hung
in
the
little
room
off
the
study
which
i
called
my
boudoir
a
very
ugly
word
by
the
way
which
i
am
trying
to
give
up
with
a
curtain
before
it
my
father
has
described
it
in
the
seaboard
parish
a
pauper
lies
dead
and
they
are
bringing
in
his
coffin
she
said
it
was
no
wonder
it
had
not
been
sold
notwithstanding
its
excellence
and
force
and
asked
if
i
would
allow
her
to
bring
lady
bernard
to
see
it
after
dinner
percivale
had
a
long
talk
with
her
and
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
sit
to
him
not
however
before
i
had
joined
my
entreaties
with
his
and
my
father
had
insisted
that
her
face
was
not
her
own
but
belonged
to
all
her
kind
the
very
next
morning
she
came
with
lady
bernard
the
latter
said
she
knew
my
husband
well
by
reputation
and
had
before
our
marriage
asked
him
to
her
house
but
had
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
possess
sufficient
attraction
percivale
was
much
taken
with
her
notwithstanding
a
certain
coldness
almost
sternness
of
manner
which
was
considerably
repellent
but
only
for
the
first
few
moments
for
when
her
eyes
lighted
up
the
whole
thing
vanished
she
was
much
pleased
with
some
of
his
pictures
criticising
freely
and
with
evident
understanding
the
immediate
result
was
that
she
bought
both
the
pauper
picture
and
that
of
the
dying
knight
but
i
am
sorry
to
deprive
your
lovely
room
of
such
treasures
percivale
she
said
with
a
kind
smile
of
course
i
shall
miss
them
i
returned
but
the
thought
that
you
have
them
will
console
me
besides
it
is
good
to
have
a
change
and
there
are
only
too
many
lying
in
the
study
from
which
he
will
let
me
choose
to
supply
their
place
will
you
let
me
come
and
see
which
you
have
chosen
she
asked
with
the
greatest
pleasure
i
answered
and
will
you
come
and
see
me
do
you
think
you
could
persuade
your
husband
to
bring
you
to
dine
with
me
i
told
her
i
could
promise
the
one
with
more
than
pleasure
and
had
little
doubt
of
being
able
to
do
the
other
now
that
my
husband
had
seen
her
a
reference
to
my
husband
dislike
to
fashionable
society
followed
and
i
had
occasion
to
mention
his
feeling
about
being
asked
without
me
of
the
latter
lady
bernard
expressed
the
warmest
approval
and
of
the
former
said
that
it
would
have
no
force
in
respect
of
her
parties
for
they
were
not
at
all
fashionable
this
was
the
commencement
of
a
friendship
for
which
we
have
much
cause
to
thank
god
nor
did
we
forget
that
it
came
through
miss
clare
i
confess
i
felt
glorious
over
my
cousin
judy
but
i
would
bide
my
time
now
that
i
am
wiser
and
i
hope
a
little
better
i
see
that
i
was
rather
spiteful
but
i
thought
then
i
was
only
jealous
for
my
new
and
beautiful
friend
perhaps
having
wronged
her
myself
i
was
the
more
ready
to
take
vengeance
on
her
wrongs
from
the
hands
of
another
which
was
just
the
opposite
feeling
to
that
i
ought
to
have
had
in
the
mean
time
our
intimacy
with
miss
clare
grew
she
interested
me
in
many
of
her
schemes
for
helping
the
poor
some
of
which
were
for
providing
them
with
work
in
hard
times
but
more
for
giving
them
an
interest
in
life
itself
without
which
she
said
no
one
would
begin
to
inquire
into
its
relations
and
duties
one
of
her
positive
convictions
was
that
you
ought
not
to
give
them
any
thing
they
to
provide
for
themselves
such
as
food
or
clothing
or
shelter
in
such
circumstances
as
rendered
it
impossible
for
them
to
do
so
the
was
in
abeyance
but
she
heartily
approved
of
making
them
an
occasional
present
of
something
they
could
not
be
expected
to
procure
for
themselves
flowers
for
instance
you
would
not
imagine
i
have
heard
her
say
how
they
delight
in
flowers
all
the
finer
instincts
of
their
being
are
drawn
to
the
surface
at
the
sight
of
them
i
am
sure
they
prize
and
enjoy
them
far
more
not
merely
than
most
people
with
gardens
and
greenhouses
do
but
far
more
even
than
they
would
if
they
were
deprived
of
them
a
gift
of
that
sort
can
only
do
them
good
but
i
would
rather
give
a
workman
a
gold
watch
than
a
leg
of
mutton
by
a
present
you
mean
a
compliment
and
none
feel
more
grateful
for
such
an
acknowledgment
of
your
human
relation
to
them
than
those
who
look
up
to
you
as
their
superior
once
when
she
was
talking
thus
i
ventured
to
object
for
the
sake
of
hearing
her
further
but
i
said
sometimes
the
most
precious
thing
you
can
give
a
man
is
just
that
compassion
which
you
seem
to
think
destroys
the
value
of
a
gift
when
compassion
itself
is
precious
to
a
man
she
answered
it
must
be
because
he
loves
you
and
believes
you
love
him
when
that
is
the
case
you
may
give
him
any
thing
you
like
and
it
will
do
neither
you
nor
him
harm
but
the
man
of
independent
feeling
except
he
be
thus
your
friend
will
not
unlikely
resent
your
compassion
while
the
beggar
will
accept
it
chiefly
as
a
pledge
for
something
more
to
be
got
from
you
and
so
it
will
tend
to
keep
him
in
beggary
would
you
never
then
give
money
or
any
of
the
necessaries
of
life
except
in
extreme
and
on
the
part
of
the
receiver
unavoidable
necessity
i
asked
i
would
not
she
answered
but
in
the
case
where
a
man
help
himself
the
very
suffering
makes
a
way
for
the
love
which
is
more
than
compassion
to
manifest
itself
in
every
other
case
the
true
way
is
to
provide
them
with
work
which
is
itself
a
good
thing
besides
what
they
gain
by
it
if
a
man
will
not
work
neither
should
he
eat
it
must
be
work
with
an
object
in
it
however
it
must
not
be
mere
labor
such
as
digging
a
hole
and
filling
it
up
again
of
which
i
have
heard
no
man
could
help
resentment
at
being
set
to
such
work
you
ought
to
let
him
feel
that
he
is
giving
something
of
value
to
you
for
the
money
you
give
to
him
but
i
have
known
a
whole
district
so
corrupted
and
degraded
by
clerical
that
one
of
the
former
recipients
of
it
declared
as
spokesman
for
the
rest
that
threepence
given
was
far
more
acceptable
than
five
shillings
earned
a
good
part
of
the
little
time
i
could
spare
from
my
own
family
was
now
spent
with
miss
clare
in
her
work
through
which
it
was
chiefly
that
we
became
by
degrees
intimate
with
lady
bernard
if
ever
there
was
a
woman
who
lived
this
outer
life
for
the
sake
of
others
it
was
she
her
inner
life
was
as
it
were
sufficient
for
herself
and
found
its
natural
outward
expression
in
blessing
others
she
was
like
a
fountain
of
living
water
that
could
find
no
vent
but
into
the
lives
of
her
fellows
she
had
suffered
more
than
falls
to
the
ordinary
lot
of
women
in
those
who
were
related
to
her
most
nearly
and
for
many
years
had
looked
for
no
personal
blessing
from
without
she
said
to
me
once
that
she
could
not
think
of
any
thing
that
could
happen
to
herself
to
make
her
very
happy
now
except
a
loved
grandson
who
was
leading
a
strange
wild
life
were
to
turn
out
a
harry
the
fifth
a
consummation
which
however
devoutly
wished
was
not
granted
her
for
the
young
man
died
shortly
after
i
believe
no
one
not
even
miss
clare
knew
half
the
munificent
things
she
did
or
what
an
immense
proportion
of
her
large
income
she
spent
upon
other
people
but
as
she
said
herself
no
one
understood
the
worth
of
money
better
and
no
one
liked
better
to
have
the
worth
of
it
therefore
she
always
administered
her
charity
with
some
view
to
the
value
of
the
probable
return
with
some
regard
that
is
to
the
amount
of
good
likely
to
result
to
others
from
the
aid
given
to
one
she
always
took
into
consideration
whether
the
good
was
likely
to
be
propagated
or
to
die
with
the
receiver
she
confessed
to
frequent
mistakes
but
such
she
said
was
the
principle
upon
which
she
sought
to
regulate
that
part
of
her
stewardship
i
wish
i
could
give
a
photograph
of
her
she
was
slight
and
appeared
taller
than
she
was
being
rather
stately
than
graceful
with
a
commanding
forehead
and
still
blue
eyes
she
gave
at
first
the
impression
of
coldness
with
a
touch
of
haughtiness
but
this
was
i
think
chiefly
the
result
of
her
inherited
physique
for
the
moment
her
individuality
appeared
when
her
being
that
is
came
into
contact
with
that
of
another
all
this
impression
vanished
in
the
light
that
flashed
into
her
eyes
and
the
smile
that
illumined
her
face
never
did
woman
of
rank
step
more
triumphantly
over
the
barriers
which
the
cumulated
custom
of
ages
has
built
between
the
classes
of
society
she
laid
great
stress
on
good
manners
little
on
what
is
called
good
birth
although
to
the
latter
in
its
deep
and
true
sense
she
attributed
the
greatest
value
as
the
ground
of
obligation
in
the
possessor
and
of
expectation
on
the
part
of
others
but
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
more
of
what
she
thought
on
this
subject
presently
for
i
bethink
me
that
it
occupied
a
great
part
of
our
conversation
at
a
certain
little
gathering
of
which
i
am
now
going
to
give
an
account
chapter
xxii
my
second
for
i
judged
that
i
might
now
give
another
little
dinner
i
thought
that
as
percivale
had
been
doing
so
well
lately
he
might
afford
with
his
knowing
brother
help
to
provide
for
his
part
of
the
entertainment
what
might
be
good
enough
to
offer
even
to
morley
and
i
now
knew
lady
bernard
sufficiently
well
to
know
also
that
she
would
willingly
accept
an
invitation
from
me
and
would
be
pleased
to
meet
miss
clare
or
indeed
would
more
likely
bring
her
with
her
i
proposed
the
dinner
and
percivale
consented
to
it
my
main
object
being
the
glorification
of
miss
clare
who
had
more
engagements
of
one
kind
and
another
than
anybody
i
knew
i
first
invited
her
asking
her
to
fix
her
own
day
at
some
considerable
remove
next
i
invited
and
morley
and
next
lady
bernard
who
went
out
very
little
then
i
invited
blackstone
and
last
of
all
roger
though
i
was
almost
as
much
interested
in
his
meeting
miss
clare
as
in
any
thing
else
connected
with
the
gathering
for
he
had
been
absent
from
london
for
some
time
on
a
visit
to
an
artist
friend
at
the
hague
and
had
never
seen
miss
clare
since
the
evening
on
which
he
and
i
quarrelled
or
rather
to
be
honest
i
quarrelled
with
him
all
accepted
and
i
looked
forward
to
the
day
with
some
triumph
i
had
better
calm
the
dread
of
my
wifely
reader
by
at
once
assuring
her
that
i
shall
not
harrow
her
feelings
with
any
account
of
culinary
blunders
the
moon
was
in
the
beginning
of
her
second
quarter
and
my
cook
brain
tolerably
undisturbed
lady
bernard
offered
me
her
cook
for
the
occasion
but
i
convinced
her
that
my
wisdom
would
be
to
decline
the
offer
seeing
such
external
influence
would
probably
tend
to
disintegration
i
went
over
with
her
every
item
of
every
dish
and
every
sauce
many
times
without
any
resulting
sense
of
security
i
confess
but
i
had
found
that
odd
as
it
may
seem
she
always
did
better
the
more
she
had
to
do
i
believe
that
her
love
of
approbation
excited
by
the
difficulty
before
her
in
its
turn
excited
her
intellect
which
then
arose
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
case
roger
arrived
first
then
blackstone
lady
bernard
brought
miss
clare
and
and
morley
came
last
there
were
several
introductions
to
be
gone
through
a
ceremony
in
which
percivale
being
awkward
would
give
me
no
assistance
whence
i
failed
to
observe
how
the
presence
of
miss
clare
affected
and
morley
but
my
husband
told
me
that
judy
turned
red
and
that
morley
bowed
to
her
with
studied
politeness
i
took
care
that
blackstone
should
take
her
down
to
dinner
which
was
served
in
the
study
as
before
the
conversation
was
broken
and
desultory
at
first
as
is
generally
the
case
at
a
and
perhaps
ought
to
be
but
one
after
another
began
to
listen
to
what
was
passing
between
lady
bernard
and
my
husband
at
the
foot
of
the
table
until
by
degrees
every
one
became
interested
and
took
a
greater
or
less
part
in
the
discussion
the
first
of
it
i
heard
was
as
next
follows
then
you
do
believe
my
husband
was
saying
in
the
importance
of
what
some
of
the
devonshire
people
call
allow
me
to
ask
what
they
mean
by
the
word
lady
bernard
returned
birth
descent
the
people
you
come
of
he
answered
of
course
i
believe
that
descent
involves
very
important
considerations
no
one
interposed
morley
can
have
a
better
right
than
your
ladyship
to
believe
that
one
can
not
nave
a
better
right
than
another
to
believe
a
fact
morley
she
answered
with
a
smile
it
is
but
a
fact
that
you
start
better
or
worse
according
to
the
position
of
your
undeniably
said
morley
and
for
all
that
is
feared
from
the
growth
of
levelling
notions
in
this
country
it
will
be
many
generations
before
a
profound
respect
for
birth
is
eradicated
from
the
feelings
of
the
english
people
he
drew
in
his
chin
with
a
jerk
and
devoted
himself
again
to
his
plate
with
the
air
of
a
dixi
he
was
not
permitted
to
eat
in
peace
however
if
you
allow
said
blackstone
that
the
feeling
can
wear
out
and
is
wearing
out
it
matters
little
how
long
it
may
take
to
prove
itself
of
a
false
because
corruptible
nature
no
growth
of
notions
will
blot
love
honesty
kindness
out
of
the
human
heart
then
said
lady
bernard
archly
am
i
to
understand
blackstone
that
you
do
believe
it
of
the
least
importance
to
come
of
decent
people
your
ladyship
puts
it
well
said
morley
laughing
mildly
and
with
authority
the
longer
the
descent
the
more
doubtful
interrupted
lady
bernard
laughing
one
can
hardly
have
come
of
decent
people
all
through
you
know
let
us
only
hope
without
inquiring
too
closely
that
their
number
preponderates
in
our
own
individual
cases
morley
stared
for
a
moment
and
then
tried
to
laugh
but
unable
to
determine
whereabout
he
was
in
respect
of
the
question
betook
himself
to
his
glass
of
sherry
blackstone
considered
it
the
best
policy
in
general
not
to
explain
any
remark
he
had
made
but
to
say
the
right
thing
better
next
time
instead
i
suppose
he
believed
with
another
friend
of
mine
that
when
explanations
become
necessary
they
become
impossible
a
paradox
well
worth
the
consideration
of
those
who
write
letters
to
newspapers
but
lady
bernard
understood
him
well
enough
and
was
only
unwinding
the
clew
of
her
idea
on
the
contrary
it
must
be
a
most
serious
fact
he
rejoined
to
any
one
who
like
myself
believes
that
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
visited
on
the
children
blackstone
objected
roger
i
ca
imagine
you
believing
such
a
manifest
injustice
it
has
been
believed
in
all
ages
by
the
best
of
people
he
returned
to
whom
possibly
the
injustice
of
it
never
suggested
itself
for
my
part
i
must
either
disbelieve
that
or
disbelieve
in
a
god
but
my
dear
fellow
do
you
see
it
is
a
fact
do
you
see
children
born
with
the
sins
of
their
parents
nestling
in
their
very
bodies
you
see
on
which
horn
of
your
own
dilemma
you
would
impale
yourself
would
you
rather
not
believe
in
a
god
than
believe
in
an
unjust
one
an
unjust
god
said
blackstone
with
the
honest
evasion
of
one
who
will
not
answer
an
awful
question
hastily
must
be
a
false
god
that
is
no
god
therefore
i
presume
there
is
some
higher
truth
involved
in
every
fact
that
appears
unjust
the
perception
of
which
would
nullify
the
appearance
i
see
none
in
the
present
case
said
roger
i
will
go
farther
than
assert
the
mere
opposite
returned
blackstone
i
will
assert
that
it
is
an
honor
to
us
to
have
the
sins
of
our
fathers
laid
upon
us
for
thus
it
is
given
into
our
power
to
put
a
stop
to
them
so
that
they
shall
descend
no
farther
if
i
thought
my
father
had
committed
any
sins
for
which
i
might
suffer
i
should
be
unspeakably
glad
to
suffer
for
them
and
so
have
the
privilege
of
taking
a
share
in
his
burden
and
some
of
the
weight
of
it
off
his
mind
you
see
the
whole
idea
is
that
of
a
family
in
which
we
are
so
grandly
bound
together
that
we
must
suffer
with
and
for
each
other
destroy
this
consequence
and
you
destroy
the
lovely
idea
itself
with
all
its
thousand
fold
results
of
loveliness
you
anticipate
what
i
was
going
to
say
blackstone
said
lady
bernard
i
would
differ
from
you
only
in
one
thing
the
chain
of
descent
is
linked
after
such
a
complicated
pattern
that
the
condition
of
one
link
or
of
many
links
even
can
not
break
the
transmission
of
qualities
i
may
inherit
from
my
or
mother
or
some
one
ever
so
much
farther
back
that
which
was
active
wrong
in
some
one
or
other
of
my
ancestors
may
appear
in
me
as
an
impulse
to
that
same
wrong
which
of
course
i
have
to
overcome
and
if
i
succeed
then
it
is
so
far
checked
but
it
may
have
passed
or
may
yet
pass
to
others
of
his
descendants
who
have
or
will
have
to
do
the
same
for
who
knows
how
many
generations
to
come
before
it
shall
cease
married
people
you
see
percivale
have
an
awful
responsibility
in
regard
of
the
future
of
the
world
you
can
not
tell
to
how
many
millions
you
may
transmit
your
failures
or
your
victories
if
i
understand
you
right
lady
bernard
said
roger
it
is
the
personal
character
of
your
ancestors
and
not
their
social
position
you
regard
as
of
importance
it
was
of
their
personal
character
alone
i
was
thinking
but
of
course
i
do
not
pretend
to
believe
that
there
are
not
many
valuable
gifts
more
likely
to
show
themselves
in
what
is
called
a
long
descent
for
doubtless
a
continuity
of
education
does
much
to
develop
the
race
but
if
it
is
personal
character
you
chiefly
regard
we
may
say
we
are
all
equally
far
descended
i
remarked
for
we
have
each
had
about
the
same
number
of
ancestors
with
a
character
of
some
sort
or
other
whose
faults
and
virtues
have
to
do
with
ours
and
for
both
of
which
we
are
according
to
blackstone
in
a
most
real
and
important
sense
accountable
certainly
returned
lady
bernard
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
in
whose
descent
the
good
or
the
bad
may
predominate
i
can
not
tell
for
instance
how
much
of
the
property
i
inherit
has
been
honestly
come
by
or
is
the
spoil
of
rapacity
and
injustice
you
are
doing
the
best
you
can
to
atone
for
such
a
possible
fact
then
by
its
redistribution
said
my
husband
i
confess
she
answered
the
doubt
has
had
some
share
in
determining
my
feeling
with
regard
to
the
management
of
my
property
i
have
no
right
to
throw
up
my
stewardship
for
that
was
none
of
my
seeking
and
i
do
not
know
any
one
who
has
a
better
claim
to
it
but
i
count
it
only
a
stewardship
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
throw
my
orchard
open
for
that
would
result
not
only
in
its
destruction
but
in
a
renewal
of
the
fight
of
centuries
ago
for
its
possession
but
i
will
try
to
distribute
my
apples
properly
that
is
i
have
not
the
same
right
to
give
away
foolishly
that
i
have
to
keep
wisely
then
resumed
roger
who
had
evidently
been
pondering
what
lady
bernard
had
previously
said
you
would
consider
what
is
called
kleptomania
as
the
impulse
to
steal
transmitted
by
a
nothing
seems
to
me
more
likely
i
know
a
nobleman
whose
servant
has
to
search
his
pockets
for
spoons
or
forks
every
night
as
soon
as
he
is
in
bed
i
should
find
it
very
hard
to
define
the
difference
between
that
and
stealing
said
miss
clare
now
first
taking
a
part
in
the
conversation
i
have
sometimes
wondered
whether
kleptomania
was
not
merely
the
fashionable
name
for
stealing
the
distinction
is
a
difficult
one
and
no
doubt
the
word
is
occasionally
misapplied
but
i
think
there
is
a
difference
the
nobleman
to
whom
i
referred
makes
no
objection
to
being
thus
deprived
of
his
booty
which
for
one
thing
appears
to
show
that
the
temptation
is
intermittent
and
partakes
at
least
of
the
character
of
a
disease
but
are
there
not
diseases
which
are
only
so
much
the
worse
diseases
that
they
are
not
intermittent
said
miss
clare
is
it
not
hard
that
the
privileges
of
kleptomania
should
be
confined
to
the
rich
you
never
hear
the
word
applied
to
a
poor
child
even
if
his
father
was
habit
and
repute
a
thief
surely
when
hunger
and
cold
aggravate
the
attacks
of
inherited
temptation
they
can
not
at
the
same
time
aggravate
the
culpability
of
yielding
to
them
on
the
contrary
said
roger
one
would
naturally
suppose
they
added
immeasurable
excuse
only
said
blackstone
there
comes
in
our
ignorance
and
consequent
inability
to
judge
the
very
fact
of
the
presence
of
motives
of
a
most
powerful
kind
renders
it
impossible
to
be
certain
of
the
presence
of
the
disease
whereas
other
motives
being
apparently
absent
we
presume
disease
as
the
readiest
way
of
accounting
for
the
propensity
i
do
not
therefore
think
it
is
the
only
way
i
believe
there
are
cases
in
which
it
comes
of
pure
greed
and
is
of
the
same
kind
as
any
other
injustice
the
capability
of
exercising
which
is
more
generally
distributed
why
should
a
thief
be
unknown
in
a
class
a
proportion
of
the
members
of
which
is
capable
of
wrong
chicanery
oppression
indeed
any
form
of
absolute
selfishness
at
all
events
said
lady
bernard
so
long
as
we
do
our
best
to
help
them
to
grow
better
we
can
not
make
too
much
allowance
for
such
as
have
not
only
been
born
with
evil
impulses
but
have
had
every
animal
necessity
to
urge
them
in
the
same
direction
while
on
the
other
hand
they
have
not
had
one
of
those
restraining
influences
which
a
good
home
and
education
would
have
afforded
such
must
so
far
as
development
goes
be
but
a
little
above
the
beasts
you
open
a
very
difficult
question
said
morley
what
are
we
to
do
with
them
supposing
they
wild
beasts
we
ca
shoot
them
though
that
would
no
doubt
be
the
readiest
way
to
put
an
end
to
the
breed
even
that
would
not
suffice
said
lady
bernard
there
would
always
be
a
deposit
from
the
higher
classes
sufficient
to
keep
up
the
breed
but
morley
i
did
not
say
beasts
i
only
said
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
tiger
and
a
there
is
nearly
as
much
between
a
and
a
in
moral
attainment
i
grant
you
said
blackstone
but
in
moral
capacity
no
besides
you
must
remember
both
what
a
descent
the
has
and
what
pains
have
been
taken
with
his
individual
education
as
well
as
that
of
his
ancestors
granted
all
that
said
morley
there
the
fact
remains
for
my
part
i
confess
i
do
see
what
is
to
be
done
the
class
to
which
you
refer
goes
on
increasing
there
this
garrotting
now
i
spent
a
winter
at
algiers
lately
and
found
even
the
suburbs
of
that
city
immeasurably
safer
than
any
part
of
london
is
now
to
judge
from
the
yet
i
am
accused
of
inhumanity
and
selfishness
if
i
decline
to
write
a
check
for
every
shabby
fellow
who
calls
upon
me
pretending
to
be
a
clergyman
and
to
represent
this
or
that
charity
in
the
east
end
things
are
bad
enough
in
the
west
end
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
portland
place
for
instance
murmured
miss
clare
it
seems
to
me
highly
unreasonable
morley
went
on
why
should
i
spend
my
money
to
perpetuate
such
a
condition
of
things
that
would
in
all
likelihood
be
the
tendency
of
your
subscription
said
blackstone
then
why
should
i
repeated
morley
with
a
smile
of
triumph
but
said
miss
clare
in
an
apologetic
tone
it
seems
to
me
you
make
a
mistake
in
regarding
the
poor
as
if
their
poverty
were
the
only
distinction
by
which
they
could
be
classified
the
poor
are
not
thieves
and
garroters
nor
even
all
unthankful
and
unholy
there
are
just
as
strong
and
as
delicate
distinctions
too
in
that
stratum
of
social
existence
as
in
the
upper
strata
i
should
imagine
morley
knows
a
few
belonging
to
the
same
social
grade
with
himself
with
whom
however
he
would
be
sorry
to
be
on
any
terms
of
intimacy
not
a
few
responded
morley
with
a
righteous
frown
then
i
who
know
the
poor
as
well
at
least
as
you
can
know
the
rich
having
lived
amongst
them
almost
from
childhood
assert
that
i
am
acquainted
with
not
a
few
who
in
all
the
essentials
of
human
life
and
character
would
be
an
honor
to
any
circle
i
should
be
sorry
to
seem
to
imply
that
there
may
not
be
very
worthy
people
amongst
them
miss
clare
but
it
is
not
such
who
draw
our
attention
to
the
class
not
such
who
force
themselves
upon
your
attention
certainly
said
miss
clare
but
the
existence
of
such
may
be
an
additional
reason
for
bestowing
some
attention
on
the
class
to
which
they
belong
is
there
not
such
a
mighty
fact
as
the
body
of
christ
is
there
no
connection
between
the
head
and
the
feet
i
had
not
the
slightest
purpose
of
disputing
the
matter
with
you
miss
clare
said
morley
i
thought
rudely
for
who
would
use
the
word
at
a
on
the
contrary
being
a
practical
man
i
want
to
know
what
is
to
be
done
it
is
doubtless
a
great
misfortune
to
the
community
that
there
should
be
such
sinks
in
our
cities
but
who
is
to
blame
for
it
that
is
the
question
every
man
who
says
am
i
my
brother
keeper
why
just
consider
morley
suppose
in
a
family
there
were
one
less
gifted
than
the
others
and
that
in
consequence
they
all
withdrew
from
him
and
took
no
interest
in
his
affairs
what
would
become
of
him
must
he
not
sink
difference
of
rank
is
a
divine
appointment
you
must
allow
that
if
there
were
not
a
variety
of
grades
the
social
machine
would
soon
come
to
a
a
strong
argument
for
taking
care
of
the
smallest
wheel
for
all
the
parts
are
interdependent
that
there
should
be
different
classes
is
undoubtedly
a
divine
intention
and
not
to
be
turned
aside
but
suppose
the
boy
is
fit
for
some
manual
labor
suppose
he
takes
to
carpentering
and
works
well
and
keeps
the
house
tidy
and
every
thing
in
good
repair
while
his
brothers
pursue
their
studies
and
prepare
for
professions
beyond
his
reach
is
the
inferior
boy
degraded
by
doing
the
best
he
can
is
there
any
reason
in
the
nature
of
things
why
he
should
sink
but
he
will
most
likely
sink
sooner
or
later
if
his
brothers
take
no
interest
in
his
work
and
treat
him
as
a
being
of
nature
inferior
to
their
own
i
beg
your
pardon
said
morley
but
is
he
not
on
the
very
supposition
inferior
to
them
intellectually
yes
morally
no
for
he
is
doing
his
work
possibly
better
than
they
and
therefore
taking
a
higher
place
in
the
eternal
scale
but
granting
all
kinds
of
inferiority
his
remains
the
same
with
their
own
and
the
question
is
whether
they
treat
him
as
one
to
be
helped
up
or
one
to
be
kept
down
as
one
unworthy
of
sympathy
or
one
to
be
honored
for
filling
his
part
in
a
word
as
one
belonging
to
them
or
one
whom
they
put
up
with
only
because
his
work
is
necessary
to
them
what
do
you
mean
by
being
up
asked
morley
i
do
not
mean
helped
out
of
his
trade
but
helped
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
of
the
intellect
that
finds
its
development
in
that
way
very
good
but
yet
i
do
see
how
you
apply
your
supposition
for
an
instance
of
application
then
how
many
respectable
people
know
or
care
a
jot
about
their
servants
except
as
creatures
necessary
to
their
comfort
well
miss
clare
said
judy
addressing
her
for
the
first
time
if
you
had
had
the
half
to
do
with
servants
i
have
had
you
would
alter
your
opinion
of
them
i
have
expressed
no
opinion
returned
miss
clare
i
have
only
said
that
masters
and
mistresses
know
and
care
next
to
nothing
about
them
they
are
a
very
ungrateful
class
do
what
you
will
for
them
i
am
afraid
they
are
at
present
growing
more
and
more
corrupt
as
a
class
rejoined
miss
clare
but
gratitude
is
a
high
virtue
therefore
in
any
case
i
do
see
how
you
could
look
for
much
of
it
from
the
common
sort
of
them
and
yet
while
some
mistresses
do
not
get
so
much
of
it
as
they
deserve
i
fear
most
mistresses
expect
far
more
of
it
than
they
have
any
right
to
you
get
them
to
speak
the
truth
that
i
am
afraid
is
a
fact
i
have
never
known
one
on
whose
word
i
could
depend
insisted
judy
my
father
says
he
known
one
i
interjected
a
sad
confirmation
of
morley
said
miss
clare
but
for
my
part
i
know
very
few
persons
in
any
rank
on
whose
representation
of
things
i
could
absolutely
depend
truth
is
the
highest
virtue
and
seldom
grows
wild
it
is
difficult
to
speak
the
truth
and
those
who
have
tried
it
longest
best
know
how
difficult
it
is
servants
need
to
be
taught
that
as
well
as
everybody
else
there
is
nothing
they
resent
so
much
as
being
taught
said
judy
perhaps
they
are
very
far
from
docile
and
i
believe
it
is
of
little
use
to
attempt
giving
them
direct
lessons
how
then
are
you
to
teach
them
by
making
it
very
plain
to
them
but
without
calling
their
attention
to
it
that
speak
the
truth
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
they
may
come
to
tell
a
lie
or
two
the
less
for
that
not
a
very
hopeful
prospect
said
judy
not
a
very
rapid
improvement
said
her
husband
i
look
for
no
rapid
improvement
so
early
in
a
history
as
the
supposition
implies
said
miss
clare
but
would
you
not
tell
them
how
wicked
it
is
i
asked
they
know
already
that
it
is
wicked
to
tell
lies
but
they
do
not
feel
that
are
wicked
in
making
the
assertions
they
do
the
less
said
about
the
abstract
truth
and
the
more
shown
of
practical
truth
the
better
for
those
whom
any
one
would
teach
to
forsake
lying
so
at
least
it
appears
to
me
i
despair
of
teaching
others
except
by
learning
myself
if
you
do
no
more
than
that
you
will
hardly
produce
an
appreciable
effect
in
a
lifetime
why
should
it
be
appreciated
rejoined
miss
clare
i
should
have
said
on
the
contrary
interposed
blackstone
addressing
morley
if
you
do
less
for
more
you
can
not
do
you
will
produce
no
effect
whatever
we
have
no
right
to
make
it
a
condition
of
our
obedience
that
we
shall
see
its
reflex
in
the
obedience
of
others
said
miss
clare
we
have
to
pull
out
the
beam
not
the
mote
are
you
not
then
to
pull
the
mote
out
of
your
brother
eye
said
judy
in
no
case
and
on
no
pretence
you
have
pulled
the
beam
out
of
your
own
eye
said
blackstone
which
i
fancy
will
make
the
duty
of
finding
fault
with
one
neighbor
a
rare
one
for
who
will
venture
to
say
he
has
qualified
himself
for
the
task
it
was
no
wonder
that
a
silence
followed
upon
this
for
the
talk
had
got
to
be
very
serious
for
a
lady
bernard
was
the
first
to
speak
it
was
easier
to
take
up
the
dropped
thread
of
the
conversation
than
to
begin
a
new
reel
it
can
not
be
denied
she
said
whoever
may
be
to
blame
for
it
that
the
separation
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
has
either
been
greatly
widened
of
late
or
which
involves
the
same
practical
necessity
we
have
become
more
aware
of
the
breadth
and
depth
of
a
gulf
which
however
it
may
distinguish
their
circumstances
ought
not
to
divide
them
from
each
other
certainly
the
rich
withdraw
themselves
from
the
poor
instead
for
instance
of
helping
them
to
bear
their
burdens
they
leave
the
still
struggling
poor
of
whole
parishes
to
sink
into
hopeless
want
under
the
weight
of
those
who
have
already
sunk
beyond
recovery
i
am
not
sure
that
to
shoot
them
would
not
involve
less
injustice
at
all
events
he
that
hates
his
brother
is
a
murderer
but
there
is
no
question
of
hating
here
objected
morley
i
am
not
certain
that
absolute
indifference
to
one
neighbor
is
not
as
bad
it
came
pretty
nearly
to
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
the
priest
and
the
levite
who
passed
by
on
the
other
side
said
blackstone
still
said
morley
in
all
the
of
one
who
prided
himself
on
the
practical
i
do
not
see
that
miss
clare
has
proposed
any
remedy
for
the
state
of
things
concerning
the
evil
of
which
we
are
all
agreed
what
is
to
be
what
can
do
now
come
miss
clare
miss
clare
was
silent
marion
my
child
said
lady
bernard
turning
to
her
will
you
answer
mr
morley
not
certainly
as
to
what
can
do
that
question
i
dare
not
undertake
to
answer
i
can
only
speak
of
what
principles
i
may
seem
to
have
discovered
but
until
a
man
begins
to
behave
to
those
with
whom
he
comes
into
personal
contact
as
partakers
of
the
same
nature
to
recognize
for
instance
between
himself
and
his
a
bond
superior
to
that
of
supply
and
demand
i
can
not
imagine
how
he
is
to
do
any
thing
towards
the
drawing
together
of
the
edges
of
the
gaping
wound
in
the
social
body
but
persisted
morley
who
i
began
to
think
showed
some
real
desire
to
come
at
a
practical
conclusion
suppose
a
man
finds
himself
incapable
of
that
sort
of
thing
for
it
seems
to
me
to
want
some
rare
qualification
or
other
to
be
able
to
converse
with
an
uneducated
person
there
are
many
such
especially
amongst
those
who
follow
handicrafts
interposed
blackstone
who
think
a
great
deal
more
than
most
of
the
educated
there
is
a
truer
education
to
be
got
in
the
pursuit
of
a
handicraft
than
in
the
life
of
a
mere
scholar
but
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
morley
suppose
resumed
morley
accepting
the
apology
without
disclaimer
suppose
i
find
i
can
do
nothing
of
that
sort
is
there
nothing
of
any
sort
i
can
do
nothing
of
the
best
sort
i
firmly
believe
answered
miss
clare
for
the
genuine
recognition
of
the
human
relationship
can
alone
give
value
to
whatever
else
you
may
do
and
indeed
can
alone
guide
you
to
what
ought
to
be
done
i
had
a
rather
painful
illustration
of
this
the
other
day
a
gentleman
of
wealth
and
position
offered
me
the
use
of
his
grounds
for
some
of
my
poor
friends
whom
i
wanted
to
take
out
for
a
in
the
neighborhood
of
london
that
is
a
great
boon
but
unfortunately
whether
from
his
mistake
or
mine
i
was
left
with
the
impression
that
he
would
provide
some
little
entertainment
for
them
i
am
certain
that
at
least
milk
was
mentioned
it
was
a
lovely
day
every
thing
looked
beautiful
and
although
they
were
in
no
great
spirits
poor
things
no
doubt
the
shade
and
the
grass
and
the
green
trees
wrought
some
good
in
them
unhappily
two
of
the
men
had
got
drunk
on
the
way
and
fearful
of
giving
offence
i
had
to
take
them
back
to
the
for
their
poor
helpless
wives
could
only
cry
and
send
them
home
by
train
i
should
have
done
better
to
risk
the
offence
and
take
them
into
the
grounds
where
they
might
soon
have
slept
it
off
under
a
tree
i
had
some
distance
to
go
and
some
difficulty
in
getting
them
along
and
when
i
got
back
i
found
things
in
an
unhappy
condition
for
nothing
had
been
given
them
to
eat
or
drink
indeed
no
attention
had
been
paid
them
whatever
there
was
company
at
dinner
in
the
house
and
i
could
not
find
any
one
with
authority
i
hurried
into
the
neighboring
village
and
bought
the
contents
of
two
bakers
shops
with
which
i
returned
in
time
to
give
each
a
piece
of
bread
before
the
company
came
out
to
them
a
group
they
stood
by
themselves
languidly
regarding
the
equally
languid
but
rather
indignant
groups
of
and
hungry
men
and
women
upon
the
lawn
they
made
no
attempt
to
mingle
with
them
or
arrive
at
a
notion
of
what
was
moving
in
any
of
their
minds
the
nearest
approach
to
communion
i
saw
was
a
poke
or
two
given
to
a
child
with
the
point
of
a
parasol
were
my
poor
friends
likely
to
return
to
their
dingy
homes
with
any
great
feeling
of
regard
for
the
givers
of
such
cold
welcome
but
that
was
an
exceptional
case
said
morley
chiefly
in
this
returned
miss
clare
that
it
was
a
case
at
all
that
they
were
thus
presented
with
a
little
more
room
on
the
face
of
the
earth
for
a
few
hours
but
you
think
the
fresh
air
may
have
done
them
good
yes
but
we
were
speaking
i
thought
of
what
might
serve
towards
the
filling
up
of
the
gulf
between
the
classes
well
will
not
all
kindness
shown
to
the
poor
by
persons
in
a
superior
station
tend
in
that
direction
i
maintain
that
you
can
do
nothing
for
them
in
the
way
of
kindness
that
shall
not
result
in
more
harm
than
good
except
you
do
it
from
and
with
genuine
charity
of
soul
with
some
of
that
love
in
short
which
is
the
heart
of
religion
except
what
is
done
for
them
is
so
done
as
to
draw
out
their
trust
and
affection
and
so
raise
them
consciously
in
the
human
scale
it
can
only
tend
either
to
hurt
their
feelings
and
generate
indignation
or
to
encourage
fawning
and
beggary
but
i
am
entirely
of
your
mind
said
blackstone
but
do
go
on
i
was
going
to
add
said
miss
clare
that
while
no
other
charity
than
this
can
touch
the
sore
a
good
deal
might
yet
be
effected
by
bare
justice
it
seems
to
me
high
time
that
we
dropped
talking
about
charity
and
took
up
the
cry
of
justice
there
now
is
a
ground
on
which
a
man
of
your
influence
morley
might
do
much
i
do
know
what
you
mean
miss
clare
so
long
as
i
pay
the
market
value
for
the
labor
i
employ
i
do
not
see
how
more
can
be
demanded
of
me
as
a
right
that
is
we
will
not
enter
on
that
question
marion
if
you
please
said
lady
bernard
miss
clare
nodded
and
went
on
is
it
just
in
the
nation
she
said
to
abandon
those
who
can
do
nothing
to
help
themselves
to
be
preyed
upon
by
bad
landlords
and
dishonest
with
their
false
weights
balances
and
measures
and
adulterations
to
boot
from
all
of
whom
their
more
wealthy
brethren
are
comparatively
safe
does
not
a
nation
exist
for
the
protection
of
its
parts
have
these
no
claims
on
the
nation
would
you
call
it
just
in
a
family
to
abandon
its
less
gifted
to
any
moral
or
physical
spoiler
who
might
be
bred
within
it
to
say
a
citizen
must
take
care
of
himself
be
just
where
he
take
care
of
himself
but
can
not
be
just
where
that
is
impossible
a
thousand
causes
originating
mainly
in
the
neglect
of
their
neighbors
have
combined
to
sink
the
poor
into
a
state
of
moral
paralysis
are
we
to
say
the
paralyzed
may
be
run
over
in
our
streets
with
impunity
they
take
care
of
themselves
have
we
not
to
awake
them
to
the
very
sense
that
life
is
worth
caring
for
i
can
not
but
feel
that
the
bond
between
such
a
neglected
class
and
any
nation
in
which
it
is
to
be
found
is
very
little
stronger
than
if
indeed
as
strong
as
that
between
slaves
and
their
masters
who
could
preach
to
them
their
duty
to
the
nation
except
on
grounds
which
such
a
nation
acknowledges
only
with
the
lips
you
have
to
prove
miss
clare
said
morley
in
a
tone
that
seemed
intended
to
imply
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
affected
by
mistimed
eloquence
that
the
relation
is
that
of
a
family
i
believe
she
returned
that
it
is
closer
than
the
mere
human
relation
of
the
parts
of
any
family
but
at
all
events
until
we
their
friends
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
pretend
to
be
such
and
until
they
feel
that
we
are
their
friends
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
talk
to
them
about
god
and
religion
they
will
none
of
it
from
our
lips
will
they
from
any
lips
are
they
not
already
too
far
sunk
towards
the
brutes
to
be
capable
of
receiving
any
such
rousing
influence
suggested
blackstone
with
a
smile
evidently
wishing
to
draw
miss
clare
out
yet
further
you
turn
me
aside
blackstone
i
wanted
to
urge
morley
to
go
into
parliament
as
spiritual
member
for
the
poor
of
our
large
towns
besides
i
know
you
do
think
as
your
question
would
imply
as
far
as
my
experience
guides
me
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
there
is
a
spot
of
soil
in
every
heart
sufficient
for
the
growth
of
a
gospel
seed
and
i
believe
moreover
that
not
only
is
he
a
with
god
who
sows
that
seed
but
that
he
also
is
one
who
opens
a
way
for
that
seed
to
enter
the
soil
if
such
preparation
were
not
necessary
the
saviour
would
have
come
the
moment
adam
and
eve
fell
and
would
have
required
no
baptist
to
precede
him
a
good
deal
followed
which
i
would
gladly
record
enabled
as
i
now
am
to
assist
my
memory
by
a
more
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
views
of
miss
clare
but
i
fear
i
have
already
given
too
much
conversation
at
once
chapter
xxiii
the
end
of
the
evening
what
specially
delighted
me
during
the
evening
was
the
marked
attention
and
the
serious
look
in
the
eyes
with
which
roger
listened
it
was
not
often
that
he
did
look
serious
he
preferred
if
possible
to
get
a
joke
out
of
a
thing
but
when
he
did
enter
into
an
argument
he
was
always
fair
although
prone
to
take
the
side
of
objection
to
any
religious
remark
he
yet
never
said
any
thing
against
religion
itself
but
his
principles
and
indeed
his
nature
seemed
as
yet
in
a
state
of
solution
uncrystallized
as
my
father
would
say
morley
on
the
other
hand
seemed
an
insoluble
mass
incapable
of
receiving
impressions
from
other
minds
any
suggestion
of
his
own
mind
as
to
a
course
of
action
or
a
mode
of
thinking
had
a
good
chance
of
being
without
question
regarded
as
reasonable
and
right
he
was
more
than
ordinarily
prejudiced
in
his
own
favor
the
day
after
they
thus
met
at
our
house
miss
clare
had
a
letter
from
him
in
which
he
took
the
high
hand
with
her
rebuking
her
solemnly
for
her
presumption
in
saying
as
he
represented
it
that
no
good
could
be
done
except
after
the
fashion
she
laid
down
and
assuring
her
that
she
would
thus
alienate
the
most
valuable
assistance
from
any
scheme
she
might
cherish
for
the
amelioration
of
the
condition
of
the
lower
classes
it
ended
with
the
offer
of
a
yearly
subscription
of
five
pounds
to
any
project
of
the
wisdom
of
which
she
would
take
the
trouble
to
convince
him
she
replied
thanking
him
both
for
his
advice
and
his
offer
but
saying
that
as
she
had
no
scheme
on
foot
requiring
such
assistance
she
could
not
at
present
accept
the
latter
should
however
any
thing
show
itself
for
which
that
sort
of
help
was
desirable
she
would
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
him
of
it
when
the
ladies
rose
judy
took
me
aside
and
said
what
does
it
all
mean
wynnie
just
what
you
hear
i
answered
you
asked
us
to
have
a
triumph
over
me
you
naughty
thing
well
partly
if
i
am
to
be
honest
but
far
more
to
make
you
do
justice
to
miss
clare
you
being
my
cousin
she
had
a
right
to
that
at
my
hands
does
lady
bernard
know
as
much
about
her
as
she
seems
she
knows
every
thing
about
her
and
visits
her
too
in
her
very
questionable
abode
you
see
judy
a
report
may
be
a
fact
and
yet
be
untrue
i
not
going
to
be
lectured
by
a
chit
like
you
but
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
talk
with
miss
clare
i
will
make
you
an
opportunity
i
did
so
and
could
not
help
overhearing
a
very
pretty
apology
to
which
miss
clare
replied
that
she
feared
she
only
was
to
blame
inasmuch
as
she
ought
to
have
explained
the
peculiarity
of
her
circumstances
before
accepting
the
engagement
at
the
time
it
had
not
appeared
to
her
necessary
she
said
but
now
she
would
make
a
point
of
explaining
before
she
accepted
any
fresh
duty
of
the
kind
for
she
saw
it
would
be
fairer
to
both
parties
it
was
no
wonder
such
an
answer
should
entirely
disarm
cousin
judy
who
forthwith
begged
she
would
if
she
had
no
objection
resume
her
lessons
with
the
children
at
the
commencement
of
the
next
quarter
but
i
understand
from
percivale
objected
miss
clare
that
the
office
is
filled
to
your
thorough
satisfaction
yes
the
lady
i
have
is
an
excellent
teacher
but
the
engagement
was
only
for
a
quarter
if
you
have
no
other
reason
for
parting
with
her
i
could
not
think
of
stepping
into
her
place
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
her
and
my
want
of
openness
with
you
would
be
the
cause
of
it
if
you
should
part
with
her
for
any
other
reason
i
should
be
very
glad
to
serve
you
again
judy
tried
to
argue
with
her
but
miss
clare
was
immovable
will
you
let
me
come
and
see
you
then
said
judy
with
all
my
heart
she
answered
you
had
better
come
with
percivale
though
for
it
would
not
be
easy
for
you
to
find
the
place
we
went
up
to
the
to
tea
passing
through
the
study
and
taking
the
gentlemen
with
us
miss
clare
played
to
us
and
sang
several
songs
the
last
a
ballad
of
schiller
the
pilgrim
setting
forth
the
constant
striving
of
the
soul
after
something
of
which
it
never
lays
hold
the
last
verse
of
it
i
managed
to
remember
it
was
this
thither
ah
no
footpath
bendeth
ah
the
heaven
above
so
clear
never
earth
to
touch
descendeth
and
the
there
is
never
here
that
is
a
beautiful
song
and
beautifully
sung
said
blackstone
but
i
am
a
little
surprised
at
your
choosing
to
sing
it
for
you
can
not
call
it
a
christian
song
do
you
find
paul
saying
something
very
like
it
again
and
again
miss
clare
returned
with
a
smile
as
if
she
perfectly
knew
what
he
objected
to
you
find
him
striving
journeying
pressing
on
reaching
out
to
lay
hold
but
never
having
attained
ever
conscious
of
failure
that
is
true
but
there
is
this
huge
difference
that
paul
expects
to
attain
is
confident
of
one
day
attaining
while
schiller
in
that
lyric
at
least
seems
i
only
say
seems
hopeless
of
any
satisfaction
dort
ist
niemals
it
may
have
been
only
a
mood
said
miss
clare
paul
had
his
moods
also
from
which
he
had
to
rouse
himself
to
fresh
faith
and
hope
and
effort
but
paul
writes
only
in
his
hopeful
moods
such
alone
he
counts
worthy
of
sharing
with
his
fellows
if
there
is
no
hope
why
upon
any
theory
take
the
trouble
to
say
so
it
is
pure
weakness
to
desire
sympathy
in
hopelessness
hope
alone
justifies
as
well
as
excites
either
utterance
or
effort
i
admit
all
you
say
blackstone
and
yet
i
think
such
a
poem
invaluable
for
is
not
schiller
therein
the
mouth
of
the
whole
creation
groaning
and
travailling
and
inarticulately
crying
out
for
the
sonship
unconsciously
then
he
does
not
know
what
he
wants
not
neither
does
the
creation
neither
do
we
we
do
know
it
is
oneness
with
god
we
want
but
of
what
that
means
we
have
only
vague
though
glowing
hints
i
saw
morley
scratch
his
left
ear
like
a
young
calf
only
more
impatiently
but
miss
clare
went
on
is
it
not
invaluable
as
the
confession
of
one
of
the
noblest
of
spirits
that
he
had
found
neither
repose
nor
sense
of
attainment
but
said
roger
did
you
ever
know
any
one
of
those
you
call
christians
who
professed
to
have
reached
satisfaction
or
if
so
whose
life
would
justify
you
in
believing
him
i
have
never
known
a
satisfied
christian
i
confess
answered
miss
clare
indeed
i
should
take
satisfaction
as
a
poor
voucher
for
christianity
but
i
have
known
several
contented
christians
i
might
in
respect
of
one
or
two
of
them
use
a
stronger
word
certainly
not
i
believe
there
is
a
grand
essential
unsatisfaction
i
do
not
mean
dissatisfaction
which
adds
the
delight
of
expectation
to
the
peace
of
attainment
and
that
i
presume
is
the
very
consciousness
of
heaven
but
where
faith
may
not
have
produced
even
contentment
it
will
yet
sustain
hope
which
if
we
may
judge
from
the
ballad
no
mere
aspiration
can
we
must
believe
in
a
living
ideal
before
we
can
have
a
tireless
heart
an
ideal
which
draws
our
poor
vague
ideal
to
itself
to
fill
it
full
and
make
it
alive
i
should
have
been
amazed
to
hear
miss
clare
talk
like
this
had
i
not
often
heard
my
father
say
that
aspiration
and
obedience
were
the
two
mightiest
forces
for
development
her
own
needs
and
her
own
deeds
had
been
her
tutors
and
the
light
by
which
she
had
read
their
lessons
was
the
candle
of
the
lord
within
her
when
my
husband
would
have
put
her
into
lady
bernard
carriage
as
they
were
leaving
she
said
she
should
prefer
walking
home
and
as
lady
bernard
did
not
press
her
to
the
contrary
percivale
could
not
remonstrate
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
walk
with
you
miss
clare
he
said
must
not
leave
my
duties
but
there
not
the
slightest
occasion
she
interrupted
i
know
every
yard
of
the
way
the
carriage
drove
off
in
one
direction
and
miss
clare
tripped
lightly
along
in
the
other
percivale
darted
into
the
house
and
told
roger
who
snatched
up
his
hat
and
bounded
after
her
already
she
was
out
of
sight
but
he
following
overtook
her
in
the
crescent
it
was
however
only
after
persistent
entreaty
that
he
prevailed
on
her
to
allow
him
to
accompany
her
you
do
not
know
roger
she
said
pleasantly
what
you
may
be
exposing
yourself
to
in
going
with
me
i
may
have
to
do
something
you
would
like
to
have
a
share
in
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
have
the
humblest
share
in
any
thing
you
draw
me
into
said
roger
as
it
fell
out
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
came
upon
a
little
crowd
chiefly
of
boys
who
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
long
before
gathered
about
a
man
and
woman
the
man
was
forcing
his
company
on
a
woman
who
was
evidently
annoyed
that
she
could
not
get
rid
of
him
is
he
your
husband
asked
miss
clare
making
her
way
through
the
crowd
no
miss
the
woman
answered
i
never
saw
him
afore
i
only
just
come
in
from
the
country
she
looked
more
angry
than
frightened
roger
said
her
black
eyes
flashed
dangerously
and
she
felt
about
the
bosom
of
her
dress
for
a
knife
he
was
certain
you
leave
her
alone
he
said
to
the
man
getting
between
him
and
her
mind
your
own
business
returned
the
man
in
a
voice
that
showed
he
was
drunk
for
a
moment
roger
was
undecided
what
to
do
for
he
feared
involving
miss
clare
in
a
as
he
called
it
but
when
the
fellow
pushing
suddenly
past
him
laid
his
hand
on
miss
clare
and
shoved
her
away
he
gave
him
a
blow
that
sent
him
staggering
into
the
street
whereupon
to
his
astonishment
miss
clare
leaving
the
woman
followed
the
man
and
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
equilibrium
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
spoke
to
him
but
in
a
voice
so
low
and
gentle
that
roger
who
had
followed
her
could
not
hear
a
word
she
said
for
a
moment
or
two
the
man
seemed
to
try
to
listen
but
his
condition
was
too
much
for
him
and
turning
from
her
he
began
again
to
follow
the
woman
who
was
now
walking
wearily
away
roger
again
interposed
do
strike
him
roger
cried
miss
clare
he
too
drunk
for
that
but
keep
him
back
if
you
can
while
i
take
the
woman
away
if
i
see
a
policeman
i
will
send
him
the
man
heard
her
last
words
and
they
roused
him
to
fury
he
rushed
at
roger
who
implicitly
obedient
only
dodged
to
let
him
pass
and
again
confronted
him
engaging
his
attention
until
help
arrived
he
was
however
by
this
time
so
fierce
and
violent
that
roger
felt
bound
to
assist
the
policeman
as
soon
as
the
man
was
locked
up
he
went
to
lime
court
the
moon
was
shining
and
the
narrow
passage
lay
bright
beneath
her
along
the
street
people
were
going
and
coming
though
it
was
past
midnight
but
the
court
was
very
still
he
walked
into
it
as
far
as
the
spot
where
we
had
together
seen
miss
clare
the
door
at
which
she
had
entered
was
open
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
house
or
its
people
and
feared
to
compromise
her
by
making
inquiries
he
walked
several
times
up
and
down
somewhat
anxious
but
gradually
persuading
himself
that
in
all
probability
no
further
annoyance
had
befallen
her
until
at
last
he
felt
able
to
leave
the
place
he
came
back
to
our
house
where
finding
his
brother
at
his
final
pipe
in
the
study
he
told
him
all
about
their
adventure
chapter
xxiv
my
first
terror
one
of
the
main
discomforts
in
writing
a
book
is
that
there
are
so
many
ways
in
which
every
thing
as
it
comes
up
might
be
told
and
you
tell
which
is
the
best
you
believe
there
must
be
a
way
but
you
might
spend
your
life
in
trying
to
satisfy
yourself
which
was
that
best
way
and
when
you
came
to
the
close
of
it
find
you
had
done
nothing
had
even
found
out
the
way
i
have
always
to
remind
myself
that
something
even
if
it
be
far
from
the
best
thing
is
better
than
nothing
perhaps
the
only
way
to
arrive
at
the
best
way
is
to
make
plenty
of
blunders
and
find
them
out
this
morning
i
had
been
sitting
a
long
time
with
my
pen
in
my
hand
thinking
what
this
chapter
ought
to
be
about
that
is
what
part
of
my
own
history
or
of
that
of
my
neighbors
interwoven
therewith
i
ought
to
take
up
next
when
my
third
child
my
little
cecilia
aged
five
came
into
the
room
and
said
mamma
there
a
poor
man
at
the
door
and
jemima
wo
give
him
any
thing
quite
right
my
dear
we
must
give
what
we
can
to
people
we
know
we
are
sure
then
that
it
is
not
wasted
but
he
so
poor
mamma
how
do
you
know
that
poor
man
he
has
three
children
i
heard
him
tell
jemima
he
was
sorry
and
very
sorry
too
but
do
you
know
you
must
go
to
the
door
when
any
one
is
talking
to
jemima
i
said
yes
mamma
i
did
go
to
the
door
i
stood
in
the
hall
and
peeped
but
you
must
even
stand
in
the
hall
i
said
mind
that
this
was
perhaps
rather
an
oppressive
reading
of
a
proper
enough
rule
but
i
had
a
very
special
reason
for
it
involving
an
important
event
in
my
story
which
occurred
about
two
years
after
what
i
have
last
set
down
one
morning
percivale
took
a
holiday
in
order
to
give
me
one
and
we
went
to
spend
it
at
richmond
it
was
the
anniversary
of
our
marriage
and
as
we
wanted
to
enjoy
it
thoroughly
and
precious
as
children
are
pleasure
is
not
enhanced
by
their
company
we
left
ours
at
home
ethel
and
her
brother
roger
named
after
percivale
father
who
was
now
nearly
a
year
old
and
wanted
a
good
deal
of
attention
it
was
a
lovely
day
with
just
a
sufficient
number
of
passing
clouds
to
glorify
that
is
to
do
justice
to
the
sunshine
and
a
gentle
breeze
which
itself
seemed
to
be
taking
a
holiday
for
it
blew
only
just
when
you
wanted
it
and
then
only
enough
to
make
you
think
of
that
wind
which
blowing
where
it
lists
always
blows
where
it
is
wanted
we
took
the
train
to
hammersmith
for
my
husband
having
consulted
the
and
found
that
the
river
would
be
propitious
wished
to
row
me
from
there
to
richmond
how
gay
the
looked
with
its
fine
broad
landing
stage
and
the
numberless
boats
ready
to
push
off
on
the
swift
water
which
kept
growing
and
growing
on
the
shingly
shore
percivale
however
would
hire
his
boat
at
a
certain
builder
shed
that
i
might
see
it
that
shed
alone
would
have
been
worth
coming
to
see
such
a
picture
of
loveliest
gloom
as
if
it
had
been
the
cave
where
the
twilight
abode
its
time
you
could
not
tell
whether
to
call
it
light
or
shade
that
diffused
presence
of
a
soft
elusive
brown
but
is
what
we
call
shade
any
thing
but
subdued
light
all
about
above
and
below
lay
the
graceful
creatures
of
the
water
moveless
and
dead
here
on
the
shore
but
there
launched
into
their
own
elemental
world
and
blown
upon
by
the
living
wind
endowed
at
once
with
life
and
motion
and
quick
response
not
having
been
used
to
boats
i
felt
nervous
as
we
got
into
the
long
hollow
fish
which
percivale
made
them
shoot
out
on
the
rising
tide
but
the
slight
fear
vanished
almost
the
moment
we
were
afloat
when
ignorant
as
i
was
of
the
art
of
rowing
i
could
not
help
seeing
how
perfectly
percivale
was
at
home
in
it
the
oars
in
his
hands
were
like
in
mine
so
deftly
so
swimmingly
so
variously
did
he
wield
them
only
once
my
fear
returned
when
he
stood
up
in
the
swaying
thing
a
mere
length
without
breadth
to
pull
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
but
he
stood
steady
sat
down
gently
took
his
oars
quietly
and
the
same
instant
we
were
shooting
so
fast
through
the
rising
tide
that
it
seemed
as
if
were
pulling
the
water
up
to
richmond
would
you
like
to
steer
said
my
husband
it
would
amuse
you
i
should
like
to
learn
i
said
not
that
i
want
to
be
amused
i
am
too
happy
to
care
for
amusement
take
those
two
cords
behind
you
then
one
in
each
hand
sitting
between
them
that
will
do
now
if
you
want
me
to
go
to
your
right
pull
your
cord
if
you
want
me
to
go
to
your
left
pull
your
one
i
made
an
experiment
or
two
and
found
the
predicted
consequences
follow
i
ran
him
aground
first
on
one
bank
then
on
the
other
but
when
i
did
so
a
third
time
come
come
he
said
this
wo
do
percivale
you
not
trying
your
best
there
is
such
a
thing
as
gradation
in
steering
as
well
as
in
painting
or
music
or
any
thing
else
that
is
worth
doing
i
pull
the
right
line
do
i
i
said
for
i
was
now
in
a
mood
to
tease
him
yes
to
a
wrong
result
he
answered
you
must
feel
your
rudder
as
you
would
the
mouth
of
your
horse
with
the
bit
and
not
do
any
thing
violent
except
in
urgent
necessity
i
answered
by
turning
the
head
of
the
boat
right
towards
the
nearer
bank
i
see
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
i
have
put
a
dangerous
power
into
your
hands
but
never
mind
the
queen
may
decree
as
she
likes
but
the
sinews
of
war
you
know
i
thought
he
meant
that
if
i
went
on
with
my
arbitrary
behavior
he
would
drop
his
oars
and
for
a
little
while
i
behaved
better
soon
however
the
spirit
of
mischief
prompting
me
i
began
my
tricks
again
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
i
had
no
more
command
over
the
boat
than
over
the
huge
barge
which
with
its
great
sail
was
slowly
ascending
in
front
of
us
i
could
turn
its
head
an
inch
in
the
direction
i
wanted
what
does
it
mean
percivale
i
cried
pulling
with
all
my
might
and
leaning
forward
that
i
might
pull
the
harder
what
does
what
mean
he
returned
coolly
that
i
ca
move
the
boat
oh
it
means
that
i
have
resumed
the
reins
of
government
but
how
i
ca
understand
it
and
i
am
wiser
than
to
make
you
too
wise
education
is
a
panacea
for
moral
evils
i
quote
your
father
my
dear
and
he
pulled
away
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
please
i
like
steering
i
said
remonstratingly
and
i
like
rowing
i
do
see
why
the
two
should
go
together
nor
i
they
ought
but
not
only
does
the
steering
depend
on
the
rowing
but
the
rower
can
steer
himself
i
will
be
a
good
girl
and
steer
properly
very
well
steer
away
he
looked
shorewards
as
he
spoke
and
then
first
i
became
aware
that
he
had
been
watching
my
hands
all
the
time
the
boat
now
obeyed
my
lightest
touch
how
merrily
the
water
rippled
in
the
sun
and
the
wind
while
so
responsive
were
our
feelings
to
the
play
of
light
and
shade
around
us
that
more
than
once
when
a
cloud
crossed
us
i
saw
its
shadow
turn
almost
into
sadness
on
the
countenance
of
my
companion
to
vanish
the
next
moment
when
the
one
sun
above
and
the
thousand
mimic
suns
below
shone
out
in
universal
laughter
when
a
steamer
came
in
sight
or
announced
its
approach
by
the
sound
of
its
beating
paddles
it
brought
with
it
a
few
moments
of
almost
awful
responsibility
but
i
found
that
the
presence
of
danger
and
duty
together
instead
of
making
me
feel
flurried
composed
my
nerves
and
enabled
me
to
concentrate
my
whole
attention
on
getting
the
head
of
the
boat
as
nearly
as
possible
at
right
angles
with
the
waves
from
the
paddles
for
percivale
had
told
me
that
if
one
of
any
size
struck
us
on
the
side
it
would
most
probably
capsize
us
but
the
way
to
give
pleasure
to
my
readers
can
hardly
be
to
let
myself
grow
garrulous
in
the
memory
of
an
ancient
pleasure
of
my
own
i
will
say
nothing
more
of
the
delights
of
that
day
they
were
such
a
contrast
to
its
close
that
twelve
months
at
least
elapsed
before
i
was
able
to
look
back
upon
them
without
a
shudder
for
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
foolish
feeling
that
our
enjoyment
had
been
somehow
to
blame
for
what
was
happening
at
home
while
we
were
thus
revelling
in
blessed
carelessness
when
we
reached
our
little
nest
rather
late
in
the
evening
i
found
to
my
annoyance
that
the
front
door
was
open
it
had
been
a
fault
of
which
i
thought
i
had
cured
the
cook
to
leave
it
thus
when
she
ran
out
to
fetch
any
thing
percivale
went
down
to
the
study
and
i
walked
into
the
about
to
ring
the
bell
in
anger
there
to
my
surprise
and
farther
annoyance
i
found
sarah
seated
on
the
sofa
with
her
head
in
her
hands
and
little
roger
wide
awake
on
the
floor
what
this
mean
i
cried
the
front
door
open
master
roger
still
up
and
you
seated
in
the
o
she
almost
shrieked
starting
up
the
moment
i
spoke
and
by
the
time
i
had
put
my
angry
interrogation
just
able
to
gasp
out
have
you
found
her
found
whom
i
returned
in
alarm
both
at
the
question
and
at
the
face
of
the
girl
for
through
the
dusk
i
now
saw
that
it
was
very
pale
and
that
her
eyes
were
red
with
crying
miss
ethel
she
answered
in
a
cry
choked
with
a
sob
and
dropping
again
on
the
sofa
she
hid
her
face
once
more
between
her
hands
i
rushed
to
the
and
called
percivale
then
returned
to
question
the
girl
i
wonder
now
that
i
did
nothing
outrageous
but
fear
kept
down
folly
and
made
me
unnaturally
calm
sarah
i
said
as
quietly
as
i
could
while
i
trembled
all
over
tell
me
what
has
happened
where
is
the
child
indeed
it
not
my
fault
i
was
busy
with
master
roger
and
miss
ethel
was
down
stairs
with
jemima
where
is
she
i
repeated
sternly
i
do
know
no
more
than
the
man
in
the
moon
where
jemima
run
out
to
look
for
her
how
long
have
you
missed
her
an
hour
or
perhaps
two
hours
i
do
know
my
head
in
such
a
whirl
i
ca
remember
when
i
saw
her
last
o
what
i
do
percivale
had
come
up
and
was
standing
beside
me
when
i
looked
round
he
was
as
pale
as
death
and
at
the
sight
of
his
face
i
nearly
dropped
on
the
floor
but
he
caught
hold
of
me
and
said
in
a
voice
so
dreadfully
still
that
it
frightened
me
more
than
any
thing
come
my
love
do
not
give
way
for
we
must
go
to
the
police
at
once
then
turning
to
sarah
have
you
searched
the
house
and
garden
he
asked
yes
sir
every
hole
and
corner
we
looked
under
every
bed
and
into
every
cupboard
and
chest
the
the
boxroom
everywhere
the
bathroom
i
cried
oh
yes
the
bathroom
and
everywhere
have
there
been
any
tramps
about
the
house
since
we
left
percivale
asked
not
that
i
know
of
but
the
nursery
window
looks
into
the
garden
you
know
sir
jemima
did
mention
it
come
then
my
dear
said
my
husband
he
compelled
me
to
swallow
a
glass
of
wine
and
led
me
away
almost
unconscious
of
my
bodily
movements
to
the
nearest
i
wondered
afterwards
when
i
recalled
the
calm
gaze
with
which
he
glanced
along
the
line
and
chose
the
horse
whose
appearance
promised
the
best
speed
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
telling
the
inspector
at
the
in
albany
street
what
had
happened
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
asking
one
question
after
another
about
her
age
appearance
and
dress
wrote
down
our
answers
he
then
called
a
man
to
whom
he
gave
the
paper
with
some
words
of
direction
the
men
are
now
going
on
their
beats
for
the
night
he
said
turning
again
to
us
they
will
all
hear
the
description
of
the
child
and
some
of
them
have
orders
to
search
thank
you
said
my
husband
which
station
had
we
better
go
to
next
the
news
will
be
at
the
farthest
before
you
can
reach
the
nearest
he
answered
we
shall
telegraph
to
the
suburbs
first
then
what
more
is
there
we
can
do
asked
percivale
nothing
said
the
inspector
except
you
find
out
whether
any
of
the
neighbors
saw
her
and
when
and
where
it
would
be
something
to
know
in
what
direction
she
was
going
have
you
any
ground
for
suspicion
have
you
ever
discharged
a
servant
were
any
tramps
seen
about
the
place
i
know
who
it
is
i
cried
it
the
woman
that
took
theodora
theodora
mother
i
know
it
is
percivale
explained
what
i
meant
that
what
people
get
you
see
when
they
take
on
themselves
other
people
business
returned
the
inspector
that
child
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
the
workhouse
he
laid
his
head
on
his
hand
for
a
moment
it
seems
likely
enough
he
added
then
after
another
pause
i
have
your
address
the
child
shall
be
brought
back
to
you
the
moment
she
found
we
ca
mistake
her
after
your
description
where
are
you
going
now
i
said
to
my
husband
as
we
left
the
station
to
the
cab
i
do
know
he
answered
except
we
go
home
and
question
all
the
shops
in
the
neighborhood
let
us
go
to
miss
clare
first
i
said
by
all
means
he
answered
we
were
soon
at
the
entrance
of
lime
court
when
we
turned
the
corner
in
the
middle
of
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
piano
she
at
home
i
cried
with
a
feeble
throb
of
satisfaction
the
fear
that
she
might
be
out
had
for
the
last
few
moments
been
uppermost
we
entered
the
house
and
ascended
the
stairs
in
haste
not
a
creature
did
we
meet
except
a
cat
the
top
of
her
head
was
black
her
forehead
and
face
white
and
the
black
and
white
were
shaped
so
as
to
look
like
hair
parted
over
a
white
forehead
which
gave
her
green
eyes
a
frightfully
human
look
as
she
crouched
in
the
corner
of
a
in
the
light
of
a
outside
but
before
we
reached
the
top
of
the
first
stair
we
heard
the
sounds
of
dancing
as
well
as
of
music
in
a
moment
after
with
our
load
of
gnawing
fear
and
helpless
eagerness
we
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
merry
assembly
of
men
women
and
children
who
filled
miss
clare
room
to
overflowing
it
was
saturday
night
and
they
were
gathered
according
to
custom
for
their
weekly
music
they
made
a
way
for
us
and
miss
clare
left
the
piano
and
came
to
meet
us
with
a
smile
on
her
beautiful
face
but
when
she
saw
our
faces
hers
fell
what
the
matter
mrs
percivale
she
asked
in
alarm
i
sunk
on
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
we
lost
ethel
said
my
husband
quietly
what
do
you
mean
you
do
no
no
she
gone
she
stolen
we
do
know
where
she
is
he
answered
with
faltering
voice
we
just
been
to
the
police
miss
clare
turned
white
but
instead
of
making
any
remark
she
called
out
to
some
of
her
friends
whose
good
manners
were
making
them
leave
the
room
do
go
please
we
want
you
then
turning
to
me
she
asked
may
i
do
as
i
think
best
yes
certainly
answered
my
husband
my
friend
percivale
she
said
addressing
the
whole
assembly
has
lost
her
little
girl
a
murmur
of
dismay
and
sympathy
arose
what
can
we
do
to
find
her
she
went
on
they
fell
to
talking
among
themselves
the
next
instant
two
men
came
up
to
us
making
their
way
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
door
the
one
was
a
elderly
man
with
whiskers
and
chin
the
other
was
my
first
acquaintance
in
the
neighborhood
the
young
bricklayer
the
elder
addressed
my
husband
while
the
other
listened
without
speaking
tell
us
what
she
like
sir
and
how
she
was
dressed
though
that
much
use
she
be
all
different
by
this
time
the
words
shot
a
keener
pang
to
my
heart
than
it
had
yet
felt
my
darling
stripped
of
her
nice
clothes
and
covered
with
dirty
perhaps
infected
garments
but
it
was
no
time
to
give
way
to
feeling
my
husband
repeated
to
the
men
the
description
he
had
given
the
police
loud
enough
for
the
whole
room
to
hear
and
the
women
in
particular
miss
clare
told
me
afterwards
caught
it
up
with
remarkable
accuracy
they
would
not
have
done
so
she
said
but
that
their
feelings
were
touched
tell
them
also
please
percivale
about
the
child
father
and
mother
found
and
brought
up
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
this
my
husband
told
them
all
the
story
adding
that
the
mother
of
the
child
might
have
found
out
who
we
were
and
taken
ours
as
a
pledge
for
the
recovery
of
her
own
here
one
of
the
women
spoke
that
dark
woman
you
took
in
one
night
two
years
ago
miss
she
say
something
i
was
astin
of
her
in
the
mornin
what
her
trouble
was
for
that
trouble
had
on
mind
was
plain
to
see
and
she
come
over
something
like
about
losin
of
a
child
but
whether
it
were
dead
or
strayed
or
stolen
or
what
i
could
tell
and
no
more
i
believe
she
wanted
me
to
here
another
woman
spoke
i
sure
i
saw
her
the
same
woman
two
days
ago
and
no
furrer
off
than
gower
street
she
said
you
too
good
by
half
miss
she
went
on
to
the
likes
of
sich
they
ai
none
of
them
respectable
perhaps
you
see
some
good
come
out
of
it
before
long
said
miss
clare
in
reply
the
words
sounded
like
a
rebuke
for
all
this
time
i
had
hardly
sent
a
thought
upwards
for
help
the
image
of
my
child
had
so
filled
my
heart
that
there
was
no
room
left
for
the
thought
of
duty
or
even
of
god
miss
clare
went
on
still
addressing
the
company
and
her
words
had
a
tone
of
authority
i
will
tell
you
what
you
must
do
she
said
you
must
every
one
of
you
run
and
tell
everybody
you
know
and
tell
every
one
to
tell
everybody
else
you
must
stop
to
talk
it
over
with
each
other
or
let
those
you
tell
it
to
stop
to
talk
to
you
about
it
for
it
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
no
time
should
be
lost
in
making
it
as
quickly
and
as
widely
known
as
possible
go
please
in
a
few
moments
the
room
was
empty
of
all
but
ourselves
the
rush
on
the
stairs
was
tremendous
for
a
single
minute
and
then
all
was
still
even
the
children
had
rushed
out
to
tell
what
other
children
they
could
find
what
must
we
do
next
said
my
husband
miss
clare
thought
for
a
moment
i
would
go
and
tell
blackstone
she
said
it
is
a
long
way
from
here
but
whoever
has
taken
the
child
would
not
be
likely
to
linger
in
the
neighborhood
it
is
best
to
try
every
thing
right
said
my
husband
come
wynnie
would
it
be
better
to
leave
percivale
with
me
said
miss
clare
it
is
dreadfully
fatiguing
to
go
driving
over
the
stones
it
was
very
kind
of
her
but
if
she
had
been
a
mother
she
would
not
have
thought
of
parting
me
from
my
husband
neither
would
she
have
fancied
that
i
could
remain
inactive
so
long
as
it
was
possible
even
to
imagine
i
was
doing
something
but
when
i
told
her
how
i
felt
she
saw
at
once
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
we
set
off
instantly
and
drove
to
blackstone
what
a
long
way
it
was
down
oxford
street
and
holborn
we
rattled
and
jolted
and
then
through
many
narrow
ways
in
which
i
had
never
been
emerging
at
length
in
a
broad
road
with
many
poor
and
a
few
fine
old
houses
in
it
then
again
plunging
into
still
more
shabby
regions
of
small
houses
which
alas
were
new
and
yet
wretched
at
length
near
an
open
space
where
yet
not
a
blade
of
grass
could
grow
for
the
trampling
of
many
feet
and
for
the
smoke
from
tall
chimneys
close
by
a
gasometer
of
awful
size
we
found
the
parsonage
and
blackstone
in
his
study
the
moment
he
heard
our
story
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
his
servant
run
jabez
he
said
and
tell
the
sexton
to
ring
the
i
will
come
to
him
directly
i
hear
it
i
may
just
mention
that
jabez
and
his
wife
who
formed
the
whole
of
blackstone
household
did
not
belong
to
his
congregation
but
were
members
of
a
small
community
in
the
neighborhood
calling
themselves
peculiar
baptists
about
ten
minutes
passed
during
which
little
was
said
blackstone
never
seemed
to
have
any
mode
of
expressing
his
feelings
except
action
and
where
that
was
impossible
they
took
hardly
any
recognizable
shape
when
the
first
boom
of
the
big
bell
filled
the
little
study
in
which
we
sat
i
gave
a
cry
and
jumped
up
from
my
chair
it
sounded
in
my
ears
like
the
knell
of
my
lost
baby
for
at
the
moment
i
was
thinking
of
her
as
once
when
a
baby
she
lay
for
dead
in
my
arms
blackstone
got
up
and
left
the
room
and
my
husband
rose
and
would
have
followed
him
but
saying
he
would
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
he
shut
the
door
and
left
us
it
was
half
an
hour
a
dreadful
before
he
returned
for
to
sit
doing
nothing
not
even
being
carried
somewhere
to
do
something
was
frightful
i
told
them
all
about
it
he
said
i
could
do
better
than
follow
miss
clare
example
but
my
impression
is
that
if
the
woman
you
suspect
be
the
culprit
she
would
make
her
way
out
to
the
open
as
quickly
as
possible
such
people
are
most
at
home
on
the
commons
they
are
of
a
less
gregarious
nature
than
the
wild
animals
of
the
town
what
shall
you
do
next
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
know
answered
my
husband
he
never
asked
advice
except
when
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
never
except
from
one
whose
advice
he
meant
to
follow
well
returned
blackstone
i
should
put
an
advertisement
into
every
one
of
the
morning
papers
but
the
offices
will
all
be
closed
said
percivale
yes
the
publishing
but
not
the
printing
offices
how
am
i
to
find
out
where
they
are
i
know
one
or
two
of
them
and
the
people
there
will
tell
us
the
rest
then
you
mean
to
go
with
us
of
course
i
do
that
is
if
you
will
have
me
you
do
think
i
would
leave
you
to
go
alone
have
you
had
any
supper
no
would
you
like
something
my
dear
said
percivale
turning
to
me
i
could
swallow
a
mouthful
i
said
nor
i
either
said
percivale
then
i
just
take
a
hunch
of
bread
with
me
said
blackstone
for
i
am
hungry
i
had
nothing
since
one
we
neither
asked
him
not
to
go
nor
offered
to
wait
till
he
had
had
his
supper
before
we
reached
square
he
had
eaten
half
a
loaf
are
you
sure
said
my
husband
as
we
were
starting
that
they
will
take
an
advertisement
at
the
i
think
they
will
the
circumstances
are
pressing
they
will
see
that
we
are
honest
people
and
will
make
a
push
to
help
us
but
for
any
thing
i
know
it
may
be
quite
we
must
pay
though
said
percivale
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
taking
out
his
purse
there
just
as
i
feared
no
money
two
three
shillings
and
sixpence
blackstone
stopped
the
cab
i
not
got
as
much
he
said
but
it
of
no
consequence
i
run
and
write
a
check
but
where
can
you
change
it
the
little
shops
about
here
wo
be
able
there
the
blue
posts
let
me
take
it
then
you
wo
be
seen
going
into
a
said
percivale
pooh
pooh
said
blackstone
do
you
think
my
character
wo
stand
that
much
besides
they
would
change
it
for
you
but
when
i
think
of
it
i
used
the
last
check
in
my
book
in
the
beginning
of
the
week
never
mind
they
will
lend
me
five
pounds
we
drove
to
the
blue
posts
he
got
out
and
returned
in
one
minute
with
five
sovereigns
what
will
people
say
to
your
borrowing
five
pounds
at
a
said
percivale
if
they
say
what
is
right
it
wo
hurt
me
but
if
they
say
what
is
wrong
that
they
can
do
any
time
and
that
wo
hurt
me
either
but
what
will
the
landlord
himself
think
i
have
no
doubt
he
feels
grateful
to
me
for
being
so
friendly
you
oblige
a
man
more
than
by
asking
a
favor
of
him
do
you
think
it
well
in
your
position
to
be
obliged
to
a
man
in
his
asked
percivale
i
do
i
am
glad
of
the
chance
it
will
bring
me
into
friendly
relations
with
him
do
you
wish
then
to
be
in
friendly
relations
with
him
indubitably
in
what
other
relations
do
you
suppose
a
clergyman
ought
to
be
with
one
of
his
parishioners
you
did
invite
into
your
parish
i
presume
no
and
he
did
invite
me
the
thing
was
settled
in
higher
quarters
there
we
are
anyhow
and
i
have
done
quite
a
stroke
of
business
in
borrowing
that
money
of
him
blackstone
laughed
and
the
laugh
sounded
frightfully
harsh
in
my
ears
a
man
my
husband
went
on
who
was
surprised
that
a
clergyman
should
be
so
liberal
a
man
who
sells
drink
in
whose
house
so
many
of
your
parishioners
will
night
get
too
drunk
to
be
in
church
the
next
morning
i
wish
having
been
drunk
were
what
keep
them
from
being
in
church
drunk
or
sober
it
would
be
all
the
same
few
of
them
care
to
go
they
are
turning
out
better
however
than
when
first
i
came
as
for
the
publican
who
knows
what
chance
of
doing
him
a
good
turn
it
may
put
in
my
way
you
do
expect
to
persuade
him
to
shut
up
shop
no
he
must
persuade
himself
to
that
what
good
then
can
you
expect
to
do
him
who
knows
i
say
you
ca
tell
what
good
may
or
may
not
come
out
of
it
any
more
than
you
can
tell
which
of
your
efforts
or
which
of
your
helpers
may
this
night
be
the
means
of
restoring
your
child
what
do
you
expect
the
man
to
say
about
it
i
shall
provide
him
with
something
to
say
i
do
want
him
to
attribute
it
to
some
foolish
charity
he
might
in
the
new
testament
publicans
are
acknowledged
to
have
hearts
yes
but
the
word
has
a
very
different
meaning
in
the
new
testament
the
feeling
religious
people
bear
towards
them
however
comes
very
near
to
that
with
which
society
regarded
the
publicans
of
old
they
are
far
more
hurtful
to
society
than
those
they
may
be
i
dare
say
they
are
perhaps
they
are
worse
than
the
sinners
with
whom
their
namesakes
of
the
new
testament
are
always
coupled
i
will
not
follow
the
conversation
further
i
will
only
give
the
close
of
it
percivale
told
me
afterwards
that
he
had
gone
on
talking
in
the
hope
of
diverting
my
thoughts
a
little
what
then
do
you
mean
to
tell
him
asked
percivale
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
said
blackstone
i
shall
go
in
morning
just
at
the
time
when
there
will
probably
be
far
too
many
people
at
the
bar
a
little
after
noon
i
shall
return
him
his
five
sovereigns
ask
for
a
glass
of
ale
and
tell
him
the
whole
story
how
my
friend
the
celebrated
painter
came
with
his
wife
and
the
rest
of
it
adding
i
trust
that
the
child
is
all
right
and
at
the
moment
probably
going
out
for
a
walk
with
her
mother
who
let
her
out
of
her
sight
for
a
moment
he
laughed
again
and
again
i
thought
him
heartless
but
i
understand
him
better
now
i
wondered
too
that
percivale
go
on
talking
and
yet
i
found
that
their
talk
did
make
the
time
go
a
little
quicker
at
length
we
reached
the
of
the
times
near
blackfriars
bridge
i
think
after
some
delay
we
saw
an
overseer
who
curt
enough
at
first
became
friendly
when
he
heard
our
case
if
he
had
not
had
children
of
his
own
we
might
perhaps
have
fared
worse
he
took
down
the
description
and
address
and
promised
that
the
advertisement
should
appear
in
the
morning
paper
in
the
best
place
he
could
now
find
for
it
before
we
left
we
received
minute
directions
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
next
nearest
office
we
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
driving
from
one
to
another
blackstone
declared
he
would
not
leave
us
until
we
had
found
her
you
have
to
preach
twice
said
percivale
it
was
then
three
i
shall
preach
all
the
better
he
returned
yes
i
feel
as
if
i
should
give
them
good
sermon
the
man
talks
as
if
the
child
were
found
already
i
thought
with
indignation
it
a
pity
he
has
a
child
of
his
own
he
would
be
more
sympathetic
at
the
same
time
if
i
had
been
honest
i
should
have
confessed
to
myself
that
his
confidence
and
hope
helped
to
keep
me
up
at
last
having
been
to
the
of
every
daily
paper
in
london
we
were
on
our
dreary
way
home
oh
how
dreary
it
was
and
the
more
dreary
that
the
cool
sweet
light
of
a
spring
dawn
was
growing
in
every
street
no
smoke
having
yet
begun
to
pour
from
the
multitudinous
chimneys
to
sully
its
purity
from
misery
and
want
of
sleep
my
soul
and
body
both
felt
like
a
gray
foggy
night
every
now
and
then
the
thought
of
my
child
came
with
a
fresh
pang
not
that
she
was
one
moment
absent
from
me
but
that
a
new
thought
about
her
would
dart
a
new
sting
into
the
throb
of
the
wound
if
you
had
asked
me
the
one
blessed
thing
in
the
world
i
should
have
said
with
my
husband
and
children
beside
me
but
i
dreaded
sleep
now
both
for
its
visions
and
for
the
frightful
waking
now
and
then
i
would
start
violently
thinking
i
heard
my
ethel
cry
but
from
the
no
child
was
ever
to
be
seen
down
all
the
lonely
street
then
i
would
sink
into
a
succession
of
efforts
to
picture
to
myself
her
little
face
white
with
terror
and
misery
and
smeared
with
the
dirt
of
the
pitiful
hands
that
rubbed
the
streaming
eyes
they
might
have
beaten
her
she
might
have
cried
herself
to
sleep
in
some
wretched
hovel
or
worse
in
some
and
crowded
with
horrible
sights
about
her
and
horrible
voices
in
her
ears
or
she
might
at
that
moment
be
dragged
wearily
along
a
farther
and
farther
from
her
mother
i
could
have
shrieked
and
torn
my
hair
what
if
i
should
never
see
her
again
she
might
be
murdered
and
i
never
know
it
o
my
darling
my
darling
at
the
thought
a
groan
escaped
me
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
arm
that
i
knew
was
my
husband
but
a
voice
was
in
my
ear
and
that
was
blackstone
do
you
think
god
loves
the
child
less
than
you
do
or
do
you
think
he
is
less
able
to
take
care
of
her
than
you
are
when
the
disciples
thought
themselves
sinking
jesus
rebuked
them
for
being
afraid
be
still
and
you
will
see
the
hand
of
god
in
this
good
you
can
not
foresee
will
come
out
of
it
i
could
not
answer
him
but
i
felt
both
rebuked
and
grateful
all
at
once
i
thought
of
roger
what
would
he
say
when
he
found
that
his
pet
was
gone
and
we
had
never
told
him
roger
i
said
to
my
husband
we
never
told
him
let
us
go
now
he
returned
we
were
at
the
moment
close
to
north
crescent
after
a
few
thundering
raps
at
the
door
the
landlady
came
down
percivale
rushed
up
and
in
a
few
minutes
returned
with
roger
they
got
into
the
cab
a
great
talk
followed
but
i
heard
hardly
any
thing
or
rather
i
heeded
nothing
i
only
recollect
that
roger
was
very
indignant
with
his
brother
for
having
been
out
all
night
without
him
to
help
i
never
thought
of
you
roger
said
percivale
so
much
the
worse
said
roger
no
said
blackstone
a
thousand
things
make
us
forget
i
dare
say
your
brother
all
but
forgot
god
in
the
first
misery
of
his
loss
to
have
thought
of
you
and
not
to
have
told
you
would
have
been
another
thing
a
few
minutes
after
we
stopped
at
our
desolate
house
and
the
cabman
was
dismissed
with
one
of
the
sovereigns
from
the
blue
posts
i
wondered
afterwards
what
manner
of
man
or
woman
had
changed
it
there
a
dim
light
was
burning
in
the
percivale
took
his
and
opened
the
door
i
hurried
in
and
went
straight
to
my
own
room
for
i
longed
to
be
alone
that
i
might
weep
nor
weep
only
i
fell
on
my
knees
by
the
bedside
buried
my
face
and
sobbed
and
tried
to
pray
but
i
could
not
collect
my
thoughts
and
overwhelmed
by
a
fresh
access
of
despair
i
started
again
to
my
feet
could
i
believe
my
eyes
what
was
that
in
the
bed
trembling
as
with
an
ague
in
terror
lest
the
vision
should
by
vanishing
prove
itself
a
vision
i
stooped
towards
it
i
heard
a
breathing
it
was
the
fair
hair
and
the
rosy
face
of
my
darling
fast
asleep
without
one
trace
of
suffering
on
her
angelic
loveliness
i
remember
no
more
for
a
while
they
tell
me
i
gave
a
great
cry
and
fell
on
the
floor
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
on
the
bed
my
husband
was
bending
over
me
and
roger
and
blackstone
were
both
in
the
room
i
could
not
speak
but
my
husband
understood
my
questioning
gaze
yes
yes
my
love
he
said
quietly
she
all
right
safe
and
sound
thank
god
and
i
did
thank
god
blackstone
came
to
the
bedside
with
a
look
and
a
smile
that
seemed
to
my
conscience
to
say
i
told
you
so
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
but
could
only
weep
then
i
remembered
how
we
had
vexed
roger
and
called
him
dear
roger
i
said
forgive
me
and
go
and
tell
miss
clare
i
had
some
reason
to
think
this
the
best
amends
i
could
make
him
i
will
go
at
once
he
said
she
will
be
anxious
and
i
will
go
to
my
sermon
said
blackstone
with
the
same
quiet
smile
they
shook
hands
with
me
and
went
away
and
my
husband
and
i
rejoiced
over
our
chapter
xxv
its
sequel
my
darling
was
recovered
neither
through
miss
clare
injunctions
nor
blackstone
a
woman
was
walking
steadily
westward
carrying
the
child
asleep
in
her
arms
when
a
policeman
stopped
her
at
turnham
green
she
betrayed
no
fear
only
annoyance
and
offered
no
resistance
only
begged
he
would
not
wake
the
child
or
take
her
from
her
he
brought
them
in
a
cab
to
the
whence
the
child
was
sent
home
as
soon
as
she
arrived
sarah
gave
her
a
warm
bath
and
put
her
to
bed
but
she
scarcely
opened
her
eyes
jemima
had
run
about
the
streets
till
midnight
and
then
fallen
asleep
on
the
doorstep
where
the
policeman
found
her
when
he
brought
the
child
for
a
week
she
went
about
like
one
dazed
and
the
blunders
she
made
were
marvellous
she
ordered
a
brace
of
cod
from
the
poulterer
and
a
pound
of
anchovies
at
the
crockery
shop
one
day
at
dinner
we
could
not
think
how
the
chops
were
so
pulpy
and
we
got
so
many
bits
of
bone
in
our
mouth
she
had
powerfully
beaten
them
as
if
they
had
been
steaks
she
sent
up
melted
butter
for
and
stuffed
a
hare
with
sausages
after
breakfast
percivale
walked
to
the
to
thank
the
inspector
pay
what
expenses
had
been
incurred
and
see
the
woman
i
was
not
well
enough
to
go
with
him
my
marion
is
a
thing
and
her
eyes
look
much
too
big
for
her
small
face
i
suggested
that
he
should
take
miss
clare
as
it
was
early
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
her
at
home
and
she
accompanied
him
willingly
and
at
once
recognized
the
woman
as
the
one
she
had
befriended
he
told
the
magistrate
he
did
not
wish
to
punish
her
but
that
there
were
certain
circumstances
which
made
him
desirous
of
detaining
her
until
a
gentleman
who
he
believed
could
identify
her
should
arrive
the
magistrate
therefore
remanded
her
the
next
day
but
one
my
father
came
when
he
saw
her
he
had
little
doubt
she
was
the
same
that
had
carried
off
theo
but
he
could
not
be
absolutely
certain
because
he
had
seen
her
only
by
moonlight
he
told
the
magistrate
the
whole
story
saying
that
if
she
should
prove
the
mother
of
the
child
he
was
most
anxious
to
try
what
he
could
do
for
her
the
magistrate
expressed
grave
doubts
whether
he
would
find
it
possible
to
befriend
her
to
any
effectual
degree
my
father
said
he
would
try
if
he
could
but
be
certain
she
was
the
mother
if
she
stole
the
child
merely
to
compel
the
restitution
of
her
own
he
said
i
can
not
regard
her
conduct
with
any
abhorrence
but
if
she
is
not
the
mother
of
the
child
i
must
leave
her
to
the
severity
of
the
law
i
once
discharged
a
woman
said
the
magistrate
who
had
committed
the
same
offence
for
i
was
satisfied
she
had
done
so
purely
from
the
desire
to
possess
the
child
but
might
not
a
thief
say
he
was
influenced
merely
by
the
desire
to
add
another
sovereign
to
his
hoard
the
greed
of
the
one
is
a
natural
affection
that
of
the
other
a
vice
but
the
injury
to
the
loser
is
far
greater
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
to
set
that
off
however
the
child
is
more
easily
discovered
besides
the
false
appetite
grows
with
indulgence
whereas
one
child
would
still
the
natural
one
then
you
would
allow
her
to
go
on
stealing
child
after
child
until
she
succeeded
in
keeping
one
said
my
father
laughing
i
dismissed
her
with
the
warning
that
if
ever
she
did
so
again
this
would
be
brought
up
against
her
and
she
would
have
the
severest
punishment
the
law
could
inflict
it
may
be
right
to
pass
a
first
offence
and
wrong
to
pass
a
second
i
tried
to
make
her
measure
the
injury
done
to
the
mother
by
her
own
sorrow
at
losing
the
child
and
i
think
not
without
effect
at
all
events
it
was
some
years
ago
and
i
have
not
heard
of
her
again
now
came
in
the
benefit
of
the
kindness
miss
clare
had
shown
the
woman
i
doubt
if
any
one
else
could
have
got
the
truth
from
her
even
she
found
it
difficult
for
to
tell
her
that
if
she
was
theo
mother
she
should
not
be
punished
might
be
only
to
tempt
her
to
lie
all
miss
clare
could
do
was
to
assure
her
of
the
kindness
of
every
one
concerned
and
to
urge
her
to
disclose
her
reasons
for
doing
such
a
grievous
wrong
as
steal
another
woman
child
they
stole
my
child
she
blurted
out
at
last
when
the
cruelty
of
the
action
was
pressed
upon
her
oh
no
said
miss
clare
you
left
her
to
die
in
the
cold
no
no
she
cried
i
wanted
somebody
to
hear
her
and
take
her
in
i
was
far
off
and
was
just
going
to
take
her
again
when
i
saw
a
light
and
heard
them
searching
for
her
oh
dear
oh
dear
then
how
can
you
say
they
stole
her
you
would
have
had
no
child
at
all
but
for
them
she
was
nearly
dead
when
they
found
her
and
in
return
you
go
and
steal
their
grandchild
they
took
her
from
me
afterwards
they
would
let
me
have
my
own
flesh
and
blood
i
wanted
to
let
them
know
what
it
was
to
have
child
taken
from
them
how
could
they
tell
she
was
your
child
when
you
stole
her
away
like
a
thief
it
might
for
any
thing
they
knew
be
some
other
woman
stealing
her
as
you
stole
theirs
the
other
day
what
would
have
become
of
you
if
it
had
been
so
to
this
reasoning
she
made
no
answer
i
want
my
child
i
want
my
child
she
moaned
then
breaking
out
i
shall
kill
myself
if
i
do
get
my
child
she
cried
oh
lady
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
child
and
not
have
her
i
shall
kill
myself
if
they
do
give
me
her
back
they
ca
say
i
did
their
child
any
harm
i
was
as
good
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
my
own
they
know
that
quite
well
and
do
want
to
punish
you
would
you
like
to
see
your
child
she
clasped
her
hands
above
her
head
fell
on
her
knees
at
miss
feet
and
looked
up
in
her
face
without
uttering
a
word
i
will
speak
to
walton
said
miss
clare
and
left
her
the
next
morning
she
was
discharged
at
the
request
of
my
husband
who
brought
her
home
with
him
sympathy
with
the
in
her
bosom
had
melted
away
all
my
resentment
she
was
a
fine
young
woman
of
about
five
and
twenty
though
her
complexion
made
her
look
at
first
much
older
with
the
help
of
the
servants
i
persuaded
her
to
have
a
bath
during
which
they
removed
her
clothes
and
substituted
others
she
objected
to
putting
them
on
seemed
at
them
as
if
they
might
involve
some
shape
of
bondage
and
begged
to
have
her
own
again
at
last
jemima
who
although
so
sparingly
provided
with
brains
is
not
without
genius
prevailed
upon
her
insisting
that
her
little
girl
would
turn
away
from
her
if
she
was
well
dressed
for
she
had
been
used
to
see
ladies
about
her
with
a
deep
sigh
she
yielded
begging
however
to
have
her
old
garments
restored
to
her
she
had
brought
with
her
a
small
bundle
tied
up
in
a
cotton
handkerchief
and
from
it
she
now
took
a
scarf
of
red
silk
and
twisted
it
up
with
her
black
hair
in
a
fashion
i
had
never
seen
before
in
this
she
had
almost
a
brilliant
look
while
her
carriage
had
a
certain
dignity
hard
of
association
with
poverty
not
inconsistent
however
with
what
i
have
since
learned
about
the
gypsies
my
husband
admired
her
even
more
than
i
did
and
made
a
very
good
sketch
of
her
her
eyes
were
large
and
dark
unquestionably
fine
and
if
there
was
not
much
of
the
light
of
thought
in
them
they
had
a
certain
wildness
which
in
a
measure
made
up
for
the
want
she
had
rather
a
spanish
than
an
eastern
look
i
thought
with
an
air
of
defiance
that
prevented
me
from
feeling
at
ease
with
her
but
in
the
presence
of
miss
clare
she
seemed
humbler
and
answered
her
questions
more
readily
than
ours
if
ethel
was
in
the
room
her
eyes
would
be
constantly
wandering
after
her
with
a
wistful
troubled
eager
look
surely
the
must
have
infinite
relations
and
destinies
as
i
was
unable
to
leave
home
my
father
persuaded
miss
clare
to
accompany
him
and
help
him
to
take
charge
of
her
i
confess
it
was
a
relief
to
me
when
she
left
the
house
for
though
i
wanted
to
be
as
kind
to
her
as
i
could
i
felt
considerable
discomfort
in
her
presence
when
miss
clare
returned
the
next
day
but
one
i
found
she
had
got
from
her
the
main
points
of
her
history
fully
justifying
previous
conjectures
of
my
father
founded
on
what
he
knew
of
the
character
and
customs
of
the
gypsies
she
belonged
to
one
of
the
principal
gypsy
families
in
this
country
the
fact
that
they
had
no
settled
habitation
but
lived
in
tents
like
abraham
and
isaac
had
nothing
to
do
with
poverty
the
silver
buttons
on
her
father
coat
were
she
said
worth
nearly
twenty
pounds
and
when
a
friend
of
any
distinction
came
to
tea
with
them
they
spread
a
of
fine
linen
on
the
grass
and
set
out
upon
it
the
best
of
china
and
a
of
silver
she
said
her
friends
as
much
as
any
gentleman
in
the
land
scorned
stealing
and
affirmed
that
no
real
gypsy
would
risk
his
neck
for
his
belly
except
he
were
driven
by
hunger
all
her
family
could
read
she
said
and
carried
a
big
bible
about
with
them
one
summer
they
were
encamped
for
several
months
in
the
neighborhood
of
edinburgh
making
and
baskets
and
some
of
them
working
in
tin
there
they
were
visited
by
a
clergyman
who
talked
and
read
the
bible
to
them
and
prayed
with
them
but
all
their
visitors
ware
not
of
the
same
sort
with
him
one
of
them
was
a
young
fellow
of
loose
character
a
clerk
in
the
city
who
attracted
by
her
appearance
prevailed
upon
her
to
meet
him
often
she
was
not
then
eighteen
any
aberration
from
the
paths
of
modesty
is
exceedingly
rare
among
the
gypsies
and
regarded
with
severity
and
her
father
hearing
of
this
gave
her
a
terrible
punishment
with
the
whip
he
used
in
driving
his
horses
in
terror
of
what
would
follow
when
the
worst
came
to
be
known
she
ran
away
and
soon
forsaken
by
her
lover
wandered
about
a
common
vagrant
until
her
baby
was
born
under
the
stars
on
a
summer
night
in
a
field
of
long
grass
for
some
time
she
wandered
up
and
down
longing
to
join
some
tribe
of
her
own
people
but
dreading
unspeakably
the
disgrace
of
her
motherhood
at
length
having
found
a
home
for
her
child
she
associated
herself
with
a
gang
of
gypsies
of
inferior
character
amongst
whom
she
had
many
hardships
to
endure
things
however
bettered
a
little
after
one
of
their
number
was
hanged
for
stabbing
a
cousin
and
her
position
improved
it
was
not
however
any
intention
of
carrying
off
her
child
to
share
her
present
lot
but
the
urgings
of
mere
for
a
sight
of
her
that
drove
her
to
the
hall
when
she
had
succeeded
in
enticing
her
out
of
sight
of
the
house
however
the
longing
to
possess
her
grew
fierce
and
braving
all
consequences
or
rather
i
presume
unable
to
weigh
them
she
did
carry
her
away
foiled
in
this
attempt
and
seeing
that
her
chances
of
future
success
in
any
similar
one
were
diminished
by
it
she
sought
some
other
plan
learning
that
one
of
the
family
was
married
and
had
removed
to
london
she
succeeded
through
gypsy
acquaintances
who
lodged
occasionally
near
tottenham
court
road
in
finding
out
where
we
lived
and
carried
off
ethel
with
the
vague
intent
as
we
had
rightly
conjectured
of
using
her
as
a
means
for
the
recovery
of
her
own
child
theodora
was
now
about
seven
years
of
age
almost
as
wild
as
ever
although
tolerably
obedient
she
was
not
nearly
so
much
so
as
the
other
children
had
been
at
her
age
partly
perhaps
because
my
father
could
not
bring
himself
to
use
that
severity
to
the
child
of
other
people
with
which
he
had
judged
it
proper
to
treat
his
own
miss
clare
was
present
with
my
father
and
the
rest
of
the
family
when
the
mother
and
daughter
met
they
were
all
more
than
curious
to
see
how
the
child
would
behave
and
whether
there
would
be
any
signs
of
an
instinct
that
drew
her
to
her
parent
in
this
however
they
were
disappointed
it
was
a
fine
warm
forenoon
when
she
came
running
on
to
the
lawn
where
they
were
assembled
the
gypsy
mother
with
them
there
she
is
said
my
father
to
the
woman
make
the
best
of
yourself
you
can
miss
clare
said
the
poor
creature
turned
very
pale
but
her
eyes
glowed
with
such
a
fire
with
the
cunning
of
her
race
she
knew
better
than
bound
forward
and
catch
up
the
child
in
her
arms
she
walked
away
from
the
rest
and
stood
watching
the
little
damsel
romping
merrily
with
wagtail
they
thought
she
recognized
the
dog
and
was
afraid
of
him
she
had
put
on
a
few
silver
ornaments
which
she
had
either
kept
or
managed
to
procure
notwithstanding
her
poverty
for
both
the
men
and
women
of
her
race
manifest
in
a
strong
degree
that
love
for
barbaric
adornment
which
as
well
as
their
other
peculiarities
points
to
an
eastern
origin
the
glittering
of
these
in
the
sun
and
the
glow
of
her
red
scarf
in
her
dark
hair
along
with
the
strangeness
of
her
whole
appearance
attracted
the
child
and
she
approached
to
look
at
her
nearer
then
the
mother
took
from
her
pocket
a
large
gilded
ball
which
had
probably
been
one
of
the
ornaments
on
the
top
of
a
clock
and
rolled
it
gleaming
golden
along
the
grass
theo
and
wagtail
bounded
after
it
with
a
shriek
and
a
bark
having
examined
it
for
a
moment
the
child
threw
it
again
along
the
lawn
and
this
time
the
mother
lithe
as
a
leopard
and
fleet
as
a
savage
joined
in
the
chase
caught
it
first
and
again
sent
it
spinning
away
farther
from
the
assembled
group
once
more
all
three
followed
in
swift
pursuit
but
this
time
the
mother
took
care
to
allow
the
child
to
seize
the
treasure
after
the
sport
had
continued
a
little
while
what
seemed
a
general
consultation
of
mother
child
and
dog
took
place
over
the
bauble
and
presently
they
saw
that
theo
was
eating
something
i
trust
said
my
mother
she
wo
hurt
the
child
with
any
nasty
stuff
she
will
not
do
so
wittingly
said
my
father
you
may
be
sure
anyhow
we
must
not
interfere
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
mother
approached
them
with
a
subdued
look
of
triumph
and
her
eyes
overflowing
with
light
carrying
the
child
in
her
arms
theo
was
playing
with
some
foreign
coins
which
adorned
her
hair
and
with
a
string
of
coral
and
silver
beads
round
her
neck
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
were
left
to
do
much
as
they
pleased
only
every
one
kept
good
watch
but
in
the
joy
of
recovering
her
child
the
mother
seemed
herself
to
have
gained
a
new
and
childlike
spirit
the
more
than
willingness
with
which
she
hastened
to
do
what
even
in
respect
of
her
child
was
requested
of
her
as
if
she
fully
acknowledged
the
right
of
authority
in
those
who
had
been
her
best
friends
was
charming
whether
this
would
last
when
the
novelty
of
the
new
experience
had
worn
off
whether
jealousy
would
not
then
come
in
for
its
share
in
the
ordering
of
her
conduct
remained
to
be
shown
but
in
the
mean
time
the
good
in
her
was
uppermost
she
was
allowed
to
spend
a
whole
fortnight
in
making
friends
with
her
daughter
before
a
word
was
spoken
about
the
future
the
design
of
my
father
being
through
the
child
to
win
the
mother
certain
people
considered
him
not
eager
enough
to
convert
the
wicked
whatever
apparent
indifference
he
showed
in
that
direction
arose
from
his
utter
belief
in
the
guiding
of
god
and
his
dread
of
outrunning
his
designs
he
would
the
operations
of
the
spirit
your
forced
fruits
he
would
say
are
often
finer
to
look
at
than
those
which
have
waited
for
god
wind
and
weather
but
what
are
they
worth
in
respect
of
all
for
the
sake
of
which
fruit
exists
until
an
opportunity
then
was
thrown
in
his
way
he
would
hold
back
but
when
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
had
to
minister
then
was
he
thoughtful
watchful
instant
unswerving
you
might
have
seen
him
during
this
time
as
the
letters
of
connie
informed
me
often
standing
for
minutes
together
watching
the
mother
and
daughter
and
pondering
in
his
heart
concerning
them
every
advantage
being
thus
afforded
her
not
without
the
stirring
of
some
natural
pangs
in
those
who
had
hitherto
mothered
the
child
the
fortnight
had
not
passed
before
to
all
appearance
the
unknown
mother
was
with
the
child
the
greatest
favorite
of
all
and
it
was
my
father
expectation
for
he
was
a
profound
believer
in
blood
that
the
natural
and
generic
instincts
of
the
child
would
be
developed
together
in
other
words
that
as
she
grew
in
what
was
common
to
humanity
she
would
grow
likewise
in
what
belonged
to
her
individual
origin
this
was
not
an
altogether
comforting
expectation
to
those
of
us
who
neither
had
so
much
faith
as
he
nor
saw
so
hopefully
the
good
that
lay
in
every
evil
one
twilight
he
overheard
the
following
talk
between
them
when
they
came
near
where
he
sat
theodora
carried
by
her
mother
and
pulling
at
her
neck
with
her
arms
was
saying
tell
me
tell
me
tell
me
in
the
tone
of
one
who
would
compel
an
answer
to
a
question
repeatedly
asked
in
vain
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
said
her
mother
you
know
well
enough
tell
me
your
name
in
reply
she
uttered
a
few
words
my
father
did
not
comprehend
and
took
to
be
zingaree
the
child
shook
her
petulantly
and
with
violence
crying
that
nonsense
i
do
know
what
you
say
and
i
do
know
what
to
call
you
my
father
had
desired
the
household
if
possible
to
give
no
name
to
the
woman
in
the
child
hearing
call
me
mam
if
you
like
but
you
not
a
lady
and
i
wo
say
to
you
said
theo
rude
as
a
child
will
sometimes
be
when
least
she
intends
offence
her
mother
set
her
down
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
was
it
only
that
the
restlessness
and
roughness
tired
her
my
father
thought
otherwise
tell
me
tell
me
the
child
persisted
beating
her
with
her
little
clenched
fist
take
me
up
again
and
tell
me
or
i
will
make
you
my
father
thought
it
time
to
interfere
he
stepped
forward
the
mother
started
with
a
little
cry
and
caught
up
the
child
theo
said
my
father
i
can
not
allow
you
to
be
rude
especially
to
one
who
loves
you
more
than
any
one
else
loves
you
the
woman
set
her
down
again
dropped
on
her
knees
and
caught
and
kissed
his
hand
the
child
stared
but
she
stood
in
awe
of
my
father
perhaps
the
more
that
she
had
none
for
any
one
else
and
when
her
mother
lifted
her
once
more
was
carried
away
in
silence
the
difficulty
was
got
over
by
the
child
being
told
to
call
her
mother
my
father
was
now
sufficiently
satisfied
with
immediate
results
to
carry
out
the
remainder
of
his
contingent
plan
of
which
my
mother
heartily
approved
the
gardener
and
his
wife
being
elderly
people
and
having
no
family
therefore
not
requiring
the
whole
of
their
cottage
which
was
within
a
short
distance
of
the
house
could
spare
a
room
which
my
mother
got
arranged
for
the
gypsy
and
there
she
was
housed
with
free
access
to
her
child
and
the
understanding
that
when
theo
liked
to
sleep
with
her
she
was
at
liberty
to
do
so
she
was
always
ready
to
make
herself
useful
but
it
was
little
she
could
do
for
some
time
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
settled
to
any
occupation
at
all
continuous
before
long
it
became
evident
that
her
old
habits
were
working
in
her
and
making
her
restless
she
was
pining
after
the
liberty
of
her
old
wandering
life
with
sun
and
wind
space
and
change
all
about
her
it
was
spring
and
the
reviving
life
of
nature
was
rousing
in
her
the
longing
for
motion
and
room
and
variety
engendered
by
the
roving
centuries
which
had
passed
since
first
her
ancestors
were
driven
from
their
homes
in
far
hindostan
but
my
father
had
foreseen
the
probability
and
had
already
thought
over
what
could
be
done
for
her
if
the
wandering
passion
should
revive
too
powerfully
he
reasoned
that
there
was
nothing
bad
in
such
an
impulse
one
doubtless
which
would
have
been
felt
in
all
its
force
by
abraham
himself
had
he
quitted
his
tents
and
gone
to
dwell
in
a
city
however
much
its
indulgence
might
place
her
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
midst
of
a
settled
social
order
he
saw
too
that
any
attempt
to
coerce
it
would
probably
result
in
entire
frustration
that
the
passion
for
old
forms
of
freedom
would
gather
tenfold
vigor
in
consequence
it
would
be
far
better
to
favor
its
indulgence
in
the
hope
that
the
love
of
her
child
would
like
an
elastic
but
infrangible
cord
gradually
tame
her
down
to
a
more
settled
life
he
proposed
therefore
that
she
should
as
a
matter
of
duty
go
and
visit
her
parents
and
let
them
know
of
her
welfare
she
looked
alarmed
your
father
will
show
you
no
unkindness
i
am
certain
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
he
added
think
it
over
and
tell
me
how
you
feel
about
it
you
shall
go
by
train
to
edinburgh
and
once
there
you
will
soon
be
able
to
find
them
of
course
you
could
take
the
child
with
you
but
she
will
be
safe
with
us
till
you
come
back
the
result
was
that
she
went
and
having
found
her
people
and
spent
a
fortnight
with
them
returned
in
less
than
a
month
the
rest
of
the
year
she
remained
quietly
at
home
stilling
her
desires
by
frequent
and
long
rambles
with
her
child
in
which
wagtail
always
accompanied
them
my
father
thought
it
better
to
run
the
risk
of
her
escaping
than
force
the
thought
of
it
upon
her
by
appearing
not
to
trust
her
but
it
came
out
that
she
had
a
suspicion
that
the
dog
was
there
to
prevent
or
at
least
expose
any
such
imprudence
the
following
spring
she
went
on
a
second
visit
to
her
friends
but
was
back
within
a
week
and
the
next
year
did
not
go
at
all
meantime
my
father
did
what
he
could
to
teach
her
presenting
every
truth
as
something
it
was
necessary
she
should
teach
her
child
with
this
duty
he
said
he
always
baited
the
hook
with
which
he
fished
for
her
or
to
take
a
figure
from
the
old
hawking
days
her
eyas
is
the
lure
with
which
i
would
reclaim
the
haggard
hawk
what
will
be
the
final
result
who
dares
prophesy
at
my
old
home
she
still
resides
grateful
and
in
some
measure
useful
idolizing
but
not
altogether
spoiling
her
child
who
understands
the
relation
between
them
and
now
calls
her
mother
dora
teaches
theo
and
the
mother
comes
in
for
what
share
she
inclines
to
appropriate
she
does
not
take
much
to
reading
but
she
is
fond
of
listening
and
is
a
regular
and
devout
attendant
at
public
worship
above
all
they
have
sufficing
proof
that
her
conscience
is
awake
and
that
she
gives
some
heed
to
what
it
says
blackstone
was
right
when
he
told
me
that
good
i
was
unable
to
foresee
would
result
from
the
loss
which
then
drowned
me
in
despair
chapter
xxvi
troubles
in
the
beginning
of
the
following
year
the
lady
who
filled
miss
place
was
married
and
miss
clare
resumed
the
teaching
of
judy
children
she
was
now
so
handsomely
paid
for
her
lessons
that
she
had
reduced
the
number
of
her
engagements
very
much
and
had
more
time
to
give
to
the
plans
in
which
she
labored
with
lady
bernard
the
latter
would
willingly
have
settled
such
an
annuity
upon
her
as
would
have
enabled
her
to
devote
all
her
time
to
this
object
but
miss
clare
felt
that
the
earning
of
her
bread
was
one
of
the
natural
ties
that
bound
her
in
the
bundle
of
social
life
and
that
in
what
she
did
of
a
spiritual
kind
she
must
be
untrammelled
by
if
she
could
not
do
both
provide
for
herself
and
assist
others
it
would
be
a
different
thing
she
said
for
then
it
would
be
clear
that
providence
intended
her
to
receive
the
hire
of
the
laborer
for
the
necessity
laid
upon
her
but
what
influenced
her
chiefly
was
the
dread
of
having
anything
she
did
for
her
friends
attributed
to
professional
motives
instead
of
the
recognition
of
eternal
relations
besides
as
she
said
it
would
both
lessen
the
means
at
lady
bernard
disposal
and
cause
herself
to
feel
bound
to
spend
all
her
energies
in
that
one
direction
in
which
case
she
would
be
deprived
of
the
recreative
influences
of
change
and
more
polished
society
in
her
labor
she
would
yet
feel
her
freedom
and
would
not
serve
even
lady
bernard
for
money
except
she
saw
clearly
that
such
was
the
will
of
the
one
master
in
thus
refusing
her
offer
she
but
rose
in
her
friend
estimation
in
the
spring
great
trouble
fell
upon
the
morleys
one
of
the
children
was
taken
with
and
then
another
and
another
was
seized
in
such
rapid
succession
until
five
of
them
were
lying
ill
together
that
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
removing
them
cousin
judy
would
accept
no
assistance
in
nursing
them
beyond
that
of
her
own
maids
until
her
strength
gave
way
and
she
took
the
infection
herself
in
the
form
of
diphtheria
when
she
was
compelled
to
take
to
her
bed
in
such
agony
at
the
thought
of
handing
her
children
over
to
hired
nurses
that
there
was
great
ground
for
fearing
her
strength
would
yield
she
lay
moaning
with
her
eyes
shut
when
a
hand
was
laid
on
hers
and
miss
clare
voice
was
in
her
ear
she
had
come
to
give
her
usual
lesson
to
one
of
the
girls
who
had
as
yet
escaped
the
infection
for
while
she
took
every
precaution
she
never
turned
aside
from
her
work
for
any
dread
of
consequences
and
when
she
heard
that
morley
had
been
taken
ill
she
walked
straight
to
her
room
go
away
said
judy
do
you
want
to
die
too
dear
morley
said
miss
clare
i
will
just
run
home
and
make
a
few
arrangements
and
then
come
back
and
nurse
you
never
mind
me
said
judy
the
children
the
children
what
i
do
i
am
quite
able
to
look
after
you
all
if
you
will
allow
me
to
bring
a
young
woman
to
help
me
you
are
an
angel
said
poor
judy
but
there
is
no
occasion
to
bring
any
one
with
you
my
servants
are
quite
competent
i
must
have
every
thing
in
my
own
hands
said
miss
clare
and
therefore
must
have
some
one
who
will
do
exactly
as
i
tell
her
this
girl
has
been
with
me
now
for
some
time
and
i
can
depend
upon
her
servants
always
look
down
upon
governesses
do
whatever
you
like
you
blessed
creature
said
judy
if
any
one
of
my
servants
behaves
improperly
to
you
or
neglects
your
orders
she
shall
go
as
soon
as
i
am
up
again
i
would
rather
give
them
as
little
opportunity
as
i
can
of
running
the
risk
if
i
may
bring
this
friend
of
my
own
i
shall
soon
have
the
house
under
hospital
regulations
but
i
have
been
talking
too
much
i
might
almost
have
returned
by
this
time
it
is
a
bad
beginning
if
i
have
hurt
you
already
by
saying
more
than
was
necessary
she
had
hardly
left
the
room
before
judy
had
fallen
asleep
so
much
was
she
relieved
by
the
offer
of
her
services
ere
she
awoke
marion
was
in
a
cab
on
her
way
back
to
bolivar
square
with
her
friend
and
two
within
an
hour
she
had
intrenched
herself
in
a
spare
bedroom
had
lighted
a
fire
got
encumbering
finery
out
of
the
way
arranged
all
the
medicines
on
a
chest
of
drawers
and
set
the
clock
on
the
going
made
the
round
of
the
patients
who
were
all
in
adjoining
rooms
and
the
round
of
the
house
to
see
that
the
disinfectants
were
fresh
and
active
added
to
their
number
and
then
gone
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
medical
attendant
in
morley
room
dr
brand
might
have
been
a
little
more
gracious
said
judy
but
i
thought
it
better
not
to
interrupt
him
by
explaining
that
you
were
not
the
professional
nurse
he
took
you
for
indeed
there
was
no
occasion
answered
miss
clare
i
should
have
told
him
so
myself
had
it
not
been
that
i
did
a
nurse
regular
work
in
george
hospital
for
two
months
and
have
been
there
for
a
week
or
so
several
times
since
so
that
i
believe
i
have
earned
the
right
to
be
spoken
to
as
such
anyhow
i
understood
every
word
he
said
meeting
morley
in
the
hall
the
doctor
advised
him
not
to
go
near
his
wife
diphtheria
being
so
infectious
but
comforted
him
with
the
assurance
that
the
nurse
appeared
an
intelligent
young
person
who
would
attend
to
all
his
directions
adding
i
could
have
wished
she
had
been
older
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
illness
about
and
experienced
nurses
are
scarce
miss
clare
was
a
week
in
the
house
before
morley
saw
her
or
knew
she
was
there
one
evening
she
ran
down
to
the
where
he
sat
over
his
lonely
glass
of
madeira
to
get
some
brandy
and
went
straight
to
the
sideboard
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
he
recognized
her
and
said
in
some
astonishment
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
miss
clare
the
nurse
can
get
what
she
wants
from
hawkins
indeed
i
do
see
excuse
me
morley
if
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
i
will
return
in
a
few
minutes
but
i
have
a
good
deal
to
attend
to
just
at
this
moment
she
left
the
room
and
as
he
had
said
nothing
in
reply
did
not
return
two
days
after
about
the
same
hour
whether
suspecting
the
fact
or
for
some
other
reason
he
requested
the
butler
to
send
the
nurse
to
him
the
nurse
from
the
nursery
sir
or
the
young
person
as
teaches
the
young
ladies
the
piano
asked
hawkins
i
mean
the
said
his
master
in
a
few
minutes
miss
clare
entered
the
and
approached
morley
how
do
you
do
miss
clare
he
said
stiffly
for
to
any
one
in
his
employment
he
was
gracious
only
now
and
then
allow
me
to
say
that
i
doubt
the
propriety
of
your
being
here
so
much
you
can
not
fail
to
carry
the
infection
i
think
your
lessons
had
better
be
postponed
until
your
pupils
are
able
to
benefit
by
them
i
have
just
sent
for
the
nurse
and
if
you
please
yes
hawkins
told
me
you
wanted
me
said
miss
clare
i
did
not
want
you
he
must
have
mistaken
i
am
the
nurse
mr
morley
then
i
say
it
is
not
with
my
approval
he
returned
rising
from
his
chair
in
anger
i
was
given
to
understand
that
a
person
was
in
charge
of
my
wife
and
family
this
is
no
ordinary
case
where
a
little
coddling
is
all
that
is
wanted
i
am
perfectly
qualified
mr
morley
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
several
times
i
must
speak
to
morley
about
this
he
said
i
entreat
you
will
not
disturb
her
she
is
not
so
well
this
afternoon
how
this
miss
clare
pray
explain
to
me
how
it
is
that
you
come
to
be
taking
a
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
family
so
very
different
from
that
for
which
morley
which
was
arranged
between
morley
and
yourself
it
is
but
an
illustration
of
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
answered
marion
a
nurse
was
wanted
morley
had
strong
objections
to
a
hired
nurse
and
i
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
set
her
mind
at
rest
it
was
very
obliging
in
you
no
doubt
he
returned
forcing
the
admission
but
but
let
us
leave
it
for
the
present
if
you
please
for
while
i
am
nurse
i
must
mind
my
business
dr
brand
expresses
himself
quite
satisfied
with
me
so
far
as
we
have
gone
and
it
is
better
for
the
children
not
to
mention
morley
to
have
some
one
about
them
they
are
used
to
she
left
the
room
without
waiting
further
parley
dr
brand
however
not
only
set
morley
mind
at
rest
as
to
her
efficiency
but
when
a
terrible
time
of
anxiety
was
at
length
over
during
which
one
after
another
and
especially
judy
herself
had
been
in
great
danger
assured
him
that
but
for
the
vigilance
and
intelligence
of
miss
clare
joined
to
a
certain
soothing
influence
which
she
exercised
over
every
one
of
her
patients
he
did
not
believe
he
could
have
brought
morley
through
then
indeed
he
changed
his
tone
to
her
in
a
measure
still
addressing
her
as
from
a
height
of
superiority
they
had
recovered
so
far
that
they
were
to
set
out
the
next
morning
for
hastings
when
he
thus
addressed
her
having
sent
for
her
once
more
to
the
i
hope
you
will
accompany
them
miss
clare
he
said
by
this
time
you
must
be
in
no
small
need
of
a
change
yourself
the
best
change
for
me
will
be
lime
court
she
answered
laughing
now
pray
do
drive
your
goodness
to
the
verge
of
absurdity
he
said
pleasantly
indeed
i
am
anxious
about
my
friends
there
she
returned
i
fear
they
have
not
been
getting
on
quite
so
well
without
me
a
and
a
roman
catholic
have
been
quarrelling
dreadfully
i
hear
morley
compressed
his
lips
it
annoying
to
be
so
much
indebted
to
one
who
from
whatever
motives
called
such
people
her
friends
oblige
me
then
he
said
loftily
taking
an
envelope
from
the
and
handing
it
to
her
by
opening
that
at
your
leisure
i
will
open
it
now
if
you
please
she
returned
it
contained
a
for
a
hundred
pounds
morley
though
a
hard
man
was
not
by
any
means
stingy
she
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
and
laid
it
again
on
the
you
owe
me
nothing
morley
she
said
owe
you
nothing
i
owe
you
more
than
i
can
ever
repay
then
do
try
it
please
you
are
generous
but
indeed
i
could
not
accept
it
you
must
oblige
me
you
take
it
from
he
added
almost
pathetically
as
if
the
bond
was
so
close
that
money
was
nothing
between
them
you
are
the
last
one
of
the
last
i
take
money
from
mr
morley
why
because
you
think
so
much
of
it
and
yet
would
look
down
on
me
the
more
if
i
accepted
it
he
bit
his
lip
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
hand
threw
back
his
head
and
turned
away
from
her
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
offend
you
she
said
and
believe
me
there
is
hardly
any
thing
i
value
less
than
money
i
have
enough
and
could
have
plenty
more
if
i
liked
i
would
rather
have
your
friendship
than
all
the
money
you
possess
but
that
can
not
be
so
long
as
she
stopped
she
was
on
the
point
of
going
too
far
she
thought
so
long
as
what
he
returned
sternly
so
long
as
you
are
a
worshipper
of
mammon
she
answered
and
left
the
room
she
burst
out
crying
when
she
came
to
this
point
she
had
narrated
the
whole
with
the
air
of
one
making
a
confession
i
am
afraid
it
was
very
wrong
she
said
and
if
so
then
it
was
very
rude
as
well
but
something
seemed
to
force
it
out
of
me
just
think
there
was
a
generous
heart
clogged
up
with
and
wealth
to
me
as
he
stood
there
on
the
he
was
a
most
pitiable
object
with
an
impervious
wall
betwixt
him
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
he
seemed
like
a
man
in
a
terrible
dream
from
which
i
awake
him
by
calling
aloud
in
his
ear
except
that
alas
the
dream
was
not
terrible
to
him
only
to
me
if
he
had
been
one
of
my
poor
friends
guilty
of
some
plain
fault
i
should
have
told
him
so
without
compunction
and
why
not
being
what
he
was
there
he
stood
a
man
of
estimable
qualities
of
beneficence
if
not
bounty
no
miser
nor
consciously
unjust
yet
a
man
whose
heart
the
moth
and
rust
were
eating
into
a
sponge
who
went
to
church
every
sunday
and
had
many
friends
not
one
of
whom
not
even
his
own
wife
would
tell
him
that
he
was
a
and
losing
his
life
it
may
have
been
useless
it
may
have
been
wrong
but
i
felt
driven
to
it
by
bare
human
pity
for
the
misery
i
saw
before
me
it
looks
to
me
as
if
you
had
the
message
given
you
to
give
him
i
said
but
though
i
do
know
it
what
if
i
was
annoyed
with
him
for
offering
me
that
wretched
hundred
pounds
in
doing
which
he
was
acting
up
to
the
light
that
was
in
him
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
light
which
is
darkness
but
i
did
not
say
so
strange
tableau
in
this
our
grand
nineteenth
century
a
young
and
poor
woman
rebuking
a
wealthy
london
merchant
on
his
own
as
a
worshipper
of
mammon
i
think
she
was
right
not
because
he
was
wrong
but
because
as
i
firmly
believe
she
did
it
from
no
personal
motives
whatever
although
in
her
modesty
she
doubted
herself
i
believe
it
was
from
pure
regard
for
the
man
and
for
the
truth
urging
her
to
an
irrepressible
utterance
if
so
should
we
not
say
that
she
spoke
by
the
spirit
only
i
shudder
to
think
what
utterance
might
with
an
equal
outward
show
be
attributed
to
the
same
spirit
well
to
his
own
master
every
one
standeth
or
falleth
whether
an
old
prophet
who
with
a
lie
in
his
right
hand
entraps
an
honorable
guest
or
a
young
prophet
who
with
repentance
in
his
heart
walks
calmly
into
the
jaws
of
the
waiting
lion
footnote
see
the
sermons
of
the
rev
henry
whitehead
vicar
of
john
limehouse
as
remarkable
for
the
profundity
of
their
insight
us
for
the
noble
severity
of
their
literary
and
no
one
can
tell
what
effects
the
words
may
have
had
upon
him
i
do
not
believe
he
ever
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
his
wife
at
all
events
there
was
no
change
in
her
manner
to
miss
clare
indeed
i
could
not
help
fancying
that
a
little
halo
of
quiet
reverence
now
encircled
the
love
in
every
look
she
cast
upon
her
she
firmly
believed
that
marion
had
saved
her
life
and
that
of
more
than
one
of
her
children
nothing
she
said
could
equal
the
quietness
and
tenderness
and
tirelessness
of
her
nursing
she
was
never
flurried
never
impatient
and
never
frightened
even
when
the
tears
would
be
flowing
down
her
face
the
light
never
left
her
eyes
nor
the
music
her
voice
and
when
they
were
all
getting
better
and
she
had
the
nursery
piano
brought
out
on
the
landing
in
the
middle
of
the
and
there
played
and
sung
to
them
it
was
she
said
like
the
voice
of
an
angel
come
fresh
to
the
earth
with
the
same
old
news
of
peace
and
when
the
children
this
i
had
from
the
friend
she
brought
with
her
were
tossing
in
the
fever
and
talking
of
strange
and
frightful
things
they
saw
one
word
from
her
would
quiet
them
and
her
gentle
firm
command
was
always
sufficient
to
make
the
most
fastidious
and
rebellious
take
his
medicine
she
came
out
of
it
very
pale
and
a
good
deal
worn
but
the
day
they
set
off
for
hastings
she
returned
to
lime
court
the
next
day
she
resumed
her
lessons
and
soon
recovered
her
usual
appearance
a
change
of
work
she
always
said
was
the
best
restorative
but
before
a
month
was
over
i
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
accept
my
mother
invitation
to
spend
a
week
at
the
hall
and
from
this
visit
she
returned
quite
invigorated
connie
whom
she
went
to
see
for
by
this
time
she
was
married
to
turner
was
especially
delighted
with
her
delight
in
the
simplicities
of
nature
born
and
bred
in
the
closest
she
had
yet
a
sensitiveness
to
all
that
made
the
country
so
dear
to
us
who
were
born
in
it
which
connie
said
surpassed
ours
and
gave
her
special
satisfaction
as
proving
that
my
oft
recurring
dread
lest
such
feelings
might
but
be
the
result
of
childish
associations
was
groundless
and
that
they
were
essential
to
the
human
nature
and
so
felt
by
god
himself
driving
along
in
the
for
connie
is
not
able
to
walk
much
although
she
is
well
enough
to
enjoy
life
thoroughly
marion
would
remark
upon
ten
things
in
a
morning
that
my
sister
had
never
observed
the
various
effects
of
light
and
shade
and
the
variety
of
feeling
they
caused
especially
interested
her
she
would
spy
out
a
lurking
sunbeam
as
another
would
find
a
hidden
flower
it
seemed
as
if
not
a
glitter
in
its
nest
of
gloom
could
escape
her
she
would
leave
the
carriage
and
make
a
long
round
through
the
fields
or
woods
and
when
they
met
at
the
appointed
spot
would
have
her
hands
full
not
of
flowers
only
but
of
leaves
and
grasses
and
weedy
things
showing
the
deepest
interest
in
such
lowly
forms
as
few
would
notice
except
from
a
scientific
knowledge
of
which
she
had
none
it
was
the
thing
itself
its
look
and
its
home
that
drew
her
attention
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
this
insight
was
profoundly
one
with
her
interest
in
the
corresponding
regions
of
human
life
and
circumstance
chapter
xxvii
miss
clare
amongst
her
friends
i
must
give
an
instance
of
the
way
in
which
marion
i
am
tired
of
calling
her
and
about
this
time
i
began
to
drop
it
exercised
her
influence
over
her
friends
i
trust
the
episode
in
a
story
so
fragmentary
as
mine
made
up
of
pieces
only
of
a
quiet
and
ordinary
life
will
not
seem
unsuitable
how
i
wish
i
could
give
it
you
as
she
told
it
to
me
so
graphic
was
her
narrative
and
so
true
to
the
forms
of
speech
amongst
the
london
poor
i
must
do
what
i
can
well
assured
it
must
come
far
short
of
the
original
representation
one
evening
as
she
was
walking
up
to
her
attic
she
heard
a
noise
in
one
of
the
rooms
followed
by
a
sound
of
weeping
it
was
occupied
by
a
journeyman
and
his
wife
who
had
been
married
several
years
but
whose
only
child
had
died
about
six
months
before
since
which
loss
things
had
not
been
going
on
so
well
between
them
some
natures
can
not
bear
sorrow
it
makes
them
irritable
and
instead
of
drawing
them
closer
to
their
own
tends
to
isolate
them
when
she
entered
she
found
the
woman
crying
and
the
man
in
a
lurid
sulk
what
the
matter
she
asked
no
doubt
in
her
usual
cheerful
tone
i
little
thought
it
would
come
to
this
when
i
married
him
sobbed
the
woman
while
the
man
remained
motionless
and
speechless
on
his
chair
with
his
legs
stretched
out
at
full
length
before
him
would
you
mind
telling
me
about
it
there
may
be
some
mistake
you
know
there
ai
no
mistake
in
said
the
woman
removing
the
apron
she
had
been
holding
to
her
eyes
and
turning
a
cheek
towards
marion
upon
which
the
marks
of
an
blow
were
visible
enough
i
did
marry
him
to
be
knocked
about
like
that
she
calls
that
knocking
about
do
she
growled
the
husband
what
did
she
go
for
to
throw
her
cotton
gownd
in
my
teeth
for
as
if
it
was
my
blame
she
war
in
silks
and
satins
after
a
good
deal
of
questioning
on
her
part
and
confused
and
recriminative
statement
on
theirs
marion
made
out
the
following
as
the
facts
of
the
case
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
married
the
wife
had
had
an
invitation
to
spend
the
evening
with
some
female
friends
the
party
had
taken
place
the
night
before
and
although
she
had
returned
in
it
had
not
broken
out
until
just
as
marion
entered
the
house
the
cause
was
this
none
of
the
guests
were
in
a
station
much
superior
to
her
own
yet
she
found
herself
the
only
one
who
had
not
a
silk
dress
hers
was
a
print
and
shabby
now
when
she
was
married
she
had
a
silk
dress
of
which
she
said
her
husband
had
been
proud
enough
when
they
were
walking
together
but
when
she
saw
the
last
of
it
she
saw
the
last
of
its
sort
for
never
another
had
he
given
her
to
her
back
and
she
did
marry
him
to
come
down
in
the
world
that
she
did
of
course
not
said
marion
you
married
him
because
you
loved
him
and
thought
him
the
finest
fellow
you
knew
and
so
he
was
then
grannie
but
just
look
at
him
now
the
man
moved
uneasily
but
without
bending
his
outstretched
legs
the
fact
was
that
since
the
death
of
the
child
he
had
so
far
taken
to
drink
that
he
was
not
unfrequently
the
worse
for
it
which
had
been
a
rare
occurrence
before
it
ai
my
fault
he
said
when
work
ai
if
i
do
dress
her
like
a
duchess
i
as
proud
to
see
my
wife
rigged
out
as
a
man
on
and
that
know
and
when
she
cast
the
contrairy
up
to
me
blowed
if
i
could
keep
my
hands
off
on
her
she
ai
the
woman
i
took
her
for
miss
she
a
temper
i
do
doubt
it
said
marion
temper
is
a
troublesome
thing
with
all
of
us
and
makes
us
do
things
we
sorry
for
afterwards
sorry
for
striking
her
ai
you
now
there
was
no
response
around
the
sullen
heart
silence
closed
again
doubtless
he
would
have
given
much
to
obliterate
the
fact
but
he
would
not
confess
that
he
had
been
wrong
we
are
so
stupid
that
confession
seems
to
us
to
fix
the
wrong
upon
us
instead
of
throwing
it
as
it
does
into
the
depths
of
the
eternal
sea
i
may
have
my
temper
said
the
woman
a
little
mollified
at
finding
as
she
thought
that
miss
clare
took
her
part
but
here
am
i
slaving
from
morning
to
night
to
make
both
ends
meet
and
goin
out
every
job
i
can
get
or
and
never
a
bit
of
fun
from
year
end
to
year
end
and
him
off
to
his
club
as
he
calls
it
an
it
a
club
like
to
blow
out
my
brains
with
some
night
when
he
comes
home
in
a
drunken
fit
for
it
worse
worse
he
get
miss
like
the
rest
on
till
no
woman
could
be
proud
as
once
i
was
to
call
him
hers
and
when
i
do
go
out
to
tea
for
once
in
a
way
to
be
jeered
at
by
them
as
is
no
better
nor
no
worse
myself
acause
i
ai
got
a
husband
as
cares
enough
for
me
to
dress
me
decent
that
do
stick
i
my
gizzard
i
do
dearly
love
to
have
neighbors
think
my
husband
care
a
bit
about
me
he
do
one
hair
and
when
he
send
me
out
like
that
here
she
broke
down
afresh
why
did
ye
stop
at
home
then
i
did
tell
ye
to
go
he
said
fiercely
calling
her
a
coarse
name
richard
said
marion
such
words
are
not
fit
for
to
hear
still
less
for
your
own
wife
oh
never
mind
me
i
used
to
sich
said
the
woman
spitefully
it
a
lie
roared
the
man
i
never
named
sich
a
word
to
ye
afore
it
do
make
me
mad
to
hear
ye
i
drink
the
clothes
off
your
back
do
i
if
i
bed
the
money
ye
might
go
in
velvet
and
lace
for
aught
i
cared
would
care
little
to
go
in
gold
and
diamonds
if
did
care
to
see
her
in
them
said
marion
at
this
the
woman
burst
into
fresh
tears
and
the
man
put
on
a
face
of
contempt
the
worst
sign
marion
said
she
had
yet
seen
in
him
not
excepting
the
blow
for
to
despise
is
worse
than
to
strike
i
ca
help
stopping
my
story
here
to
put
in
a
reflection
that
forces
itself
upon
me
many
a
man
would
regard
with
disgust
the
idea
of
striking
his
wife
who
will
yet
cherish
against
her
an
aversion
which
is
infinitely
worse
the
who
strikes
his
wife
but
is
sorry
for
it
and
tries
to
make
amends
by
being
more
tender
after
it
a
result
which
many
a
woman
will
consider
cheap
at
the
price
of
a
blow
endured
is
an
immeasurably
superior
husband
to
the
gentleman
who
shows
his
wife
the
most
absolute
politeness
but
uses
that
very
politeness
as
a
breastwork
to
fortify
himself
in
his
disregard
and
contempt
marion
saw
that
while
the
tides
ran
thus
high
nothing
could
be
done
certainly
at
least
in
the
way
of
argument
whether
the
man
had
been
drinking
she
could
not
tell
but
suspected
that
must
have
a
share
in
the
evil
of
his
mood
she
went
up
to
him
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
you
out
of
sorts
richard
come
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
i
will
sing
to
you
i
do
want
no
tea
you
fond
of
the
piano
though
and
you
like
to
hear
me
sing
you
well
i
do
he
muttered
as
if
the
admission
were
forced
from
him
come
with
me
then
he
dragged
himself
up
from
his
chair
and
was
about
to
follow
her
you
ai
going
to
take
him
from
me
grannie
after
he
been
and
struck
me
interposed
his
wife
in
a
tone
half
pathetic
half
injured
come
after
us
in
a
few
minutes
said
marion
in
a
low
voice
and
led
the
way
from
the
room
quiet
as
a
lamb
richard
followed
her
up
stairs
she
made
him
sit
in
the
and
began
with
a
low
plaintive
song
which
she
followed
with
other
songs
and
music
of
a
similar
character
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
his
wife
enter
and
both
sat
for
about
twenty
minutes
without
a
word
spoken
then
marion
made
a
pause
and
the
wife
rose
and
approached
her
husband
he
was
fast
asleep
do
wake
him
said
marion
let
him
have
his
sleep
out
you
go
down
and
get
the
place
tidy
and
a
nice
bit
of
supper
for
him
if
you
can
oh
yes
he
brought
me
home
his
week
wages
this
very
night
the
whole
yes
grannie
then
were
you
too
hard
upon
him
just
think
he
had
been
trying
to
behave
himself
and
had
got
the
better
of
the
for
once
and
come
home
fancying
you
be
so
pleased
to
see
him
and
you
he
been
drinking
interrupted
eliza
only
he
said
as
how
it
was
but
a
pot
of
beer
he
won
in
a
wager
from
a
mate
of
his
well
if
after
that
beginning
he
yet
brought
you
home
his
money
he
ought
to
have
had
another
kind
of
reception
to
think
of
the
wife
of
a
poor
man
making
such
a
fuss
about
a
silk
dress
why
eliza
i
never
had
a
silk
dress
in
my
life
and
i
do
think
i
ever
shall
laws
grannie
who
ha
thought
that
now
you
see
i
have
other
uses
for
my
money
than
buying
things
for
show
that
you
do
grannie
but
you
see
she
added
somewhat
inconsequently
we
ai
got
no
child
and
dick
he
take
it
ill
of
me
and
do
care
to
save
his
money
so
he
never
takes
me
out
nowheres
and
i
do
be
so
tired
stopping
indoors
every
day
and
all
day
long
that
it
turns
me
sour
i
do
believe
i
did
use
to
be
miss
but
laws
i
feels
now
as
if
i
let
him
knock
me
about
ever
so
if
only
he
would
say
as
how
it
was
nothing
to
him
if
i
was
dressed
ever
so
fine
you
run
and
get
his
supper
eliza
went
and
marion
sitting
down
again
to
her
instrument
improvised
for
an
hour
next
to
her
new
testament
this
was
her
greatest
comfort
she
sung
and
prayed
both
in
one
then
and
nobody
but
god
heard
any
thing
but
the
piano
nor
did
it
impede
the
flow
of
her
best
thoughts
that
in
a
chair
beside
her
slumbered
a
weary
man
the
waves
of
whose
evil
passions
she
had
stilled
and
the
sting
of
whose
disappointments
she
had
soothed
with
the
sweet
airs
and
concords
of
her
own
spirit
who
could
say
what
tender
influences
might
not
be
stealing
over
him
borne
on
the
fair
sounds
for
even
the
formless
and
the
void
was
roused
into
life
and
joy
by
the
wind
that
roamed
over
the
face
of
its
deep
no
humanity
jarred
with
hers
in
the
presence
of
the
most
degraded
she
felt
god
there
a
face
even
if
besotted
a
face
only
in
virtue
of
being
in
the
image
of
god
that
a
man
was
a
man
at
all
must
be
because
he
was
god
and
this
man
was
far
indeed
from
being
of
the
worst
with
him
beside
her
she
could
pray
with
most
of
the
good
of
having
the
door
of
her
closet
shut
and
some
of
the
good
of
the
gathering
together
as
well
thus
was
love
as
ever
the
assimilator
of
the
foreign
the
harmonizer
of
the
unlike
the
builder
of
the
temple
in
the
desert
and
of
the
chamber
in
the
as
she
sat
and
discoursed
with
herself
she
perceived
that
the
woman
was
as
certainly
suffering
from
as
any
fine
lady
in
mayfair
have
you
ever
been
to
the
national
gallery
richard
she
asked
without
turning
her
head
the
moment
she
heard
him
move
no
grannie
he
answered
with
a
yawn
most
know
what
sort
of
a
place
it
be
now
waxwork
ai
it
no
it
a
great
place
full
of
pictures
many
of
them
hundreds
of
years
old
they
taken
care
of
by
the
government
just
for
people
to
go
and
look
at

like
to
go
and
see
them
some
day

work
every
day
how
tiresome
it
is
to
be
in
the
house
from
morning
to
night
especially
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
the
sun
shining
and
the
very
sparrows
trying
to
sing
she
may
go
out
when
she
please
grannie
i
ai
no
tyrant
but
she
does
care
to
go
without
you
you
would
have
her
like
one
of
those
slatternly
women
you
see
standing
at
the
corners
with
their
fists
in
their
sides
and
their
elbows
sticking
out
ready
to
talk
to
anybody
that
comes
in
the
way
wife

never
none
o
sich
grannie
i
knows
her
as
well

though

saying

said
marion
and
they
went
down
together
eliza
had
got
the
table
set
out
nicely
with
a
foaming
jug
of
porter
beside
the
ham
and
potatoes
before
they
had
finished
marion
had
persuaded
richard
to
take
his
wife
and
her
to
the
national
gallery
the
next
day
but
one
which
fortunately
for
her
purpose
was
whit
monday
a
day
whereon
richard
who
was
from
the
north
always
took
a
holiday
at
the
national
gallery
the
in
virtue
of
his
craft
claimed
the
exercise
of
criticism
and
his
remarks
were
amusing
enough
he
had
more
than
once
painted
a
for
a
country
inn
which
fact
formed
a
bridge
between
the
covering
of
square
yards
with
color
and
the
painting
of
pictures
and
he
naturally
used
the
thus
gained
to
enhance
his
importance
with
his
wife
and
miss
clare
he
was
rather
a
clever
fellow
too
though
as
little
educated
in
any
other
direction
than
that
of
his
calling
as
might
well
be
all
the
woman
seemed
to
care
about
in
the
pictures
was
this
or
that
something
which
reminded
her
often
remotely
enough
i
dare
say
of
her
former
life
in
the
country
towards
the
close
of
their
visit
they
approached
a
picture
one
of
hobbima
i
think
which
at
once
riveted
her
attention
look
look
dick
she
cried
there
just
such
a
cart
as
my
father
used
to
drive
to
the
town
in
farmer
white
always
sent
when
the
mistress
wanted
any
thing
and
he
did
care
to
go
hisself
and
o
dick
there
the
very
moral
of
the
cottage
we
lived
in
ai
it
a
love
now
nice
enough
dick
replied
but
it
war
there
i
seed
you
liza
it
wur
at
the
big
house
where
you
was
housemaid
you
know
that
be
it
i
suppose
away
there
like
over
the
trees
they
turned
and
looked
at
each
other
and
marion
turned
away
when
she
looked
again
they
were
once
more
gazing
at
the
picture
but
close
together
and
hand
in
hand
like
two
children
as
they
went
home
in
the
omnibus
the
two
averred
they
had
never
spent
a
happier
holiday
in
their
lives
and
from
that
day
to
this
no
sign
of
their
quarrelling
has
come
to
marion
knowledge
they
are
not
only
her
regular
attendants
on
saturday
evenings
but
on
sunday
evenings
as
well
when
she
holds
a
sort
of
with
her
friends
chapter
xxviii
morley
as
soon
as
my
cousin
judy
returned
from
hastings
i
called
to
see
her
and
found
them
all
restored
except
amy
a
child
of
between
eight
and
nine
there
was
nothing
very
definite
the
matter
with
her
but
she
was
white
and
thin
and
looked
wistful
the
blue
of
her
eyes
had
grown
pale
and
her
fair
locks
had
nearly
lost
the
curl
which
had
so
well
suited
her
rosy
cheeks
she
had
been
her
father
pride
for
her
looks
and
her
mother
for
her
sayings
at
once
odd
and
simple
judy
that
morning
reminded
me
how
one
night
when
she
was
about
three
years
old
some
time
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
she
had
called
her
nurse
and
insisted
on
her
mother
coming
judy
went
prepared
to
find
her
feverish
for
there
had
been
that
day
and
she
feared
she
had
been
having
more
than
the
portion
which
on
such
an
occasion
fell
to
her
share
when
she
reached
the
nursery
amy
begged
to
be
taken
up
that
she
might
say
her
prayers
over
again
her
mother
objected
but
the
child
insisting
in
that
pretty
petulant
way
which
so
pleased
her
father
she
yielded
thinking
she
must
have
omitted
some
clause
in
her
prayers
and
be
therefore
troubled
in
her
conscience
amy
accordingly
kneeled
by
the
bedside
in
her
and
having
gone
over
all
her
petitions
from
beginning
to
end
paused
a
moment
before
the
final
word
and
inserted
the
following
special
and
peculiar
request
and
god
give
me
some
more
jam
for
ever
and
ever
amen
i
remember
my
father
being
quite
troubled
when
he
heard
that
the
child
had
been
rebuked
for
offering
what
was
probably
her
very
first
genuine
prayer
the
rebuke
however
had
little
effect
on
the
equanimity
of
the
petitioner
for
she
was
fast
asleep
a
moment
after
it
there
is
one
thing
that
puzzles
and
annoys
me
said
judy
i
ca
think
what
it
means
my
husband
tells
me
that
miss
clare
was
so
rude
to
him
the
day
before
we
left
for
hastings
that
he
would
rather
not
be
aware
of
it
any
time
she
is
in
the
house
those
were
his
very
words
will
not
interfere
with
your
doing
as
you
think
proper
he
said
you
consider
yourself
under
such
obligation
to
her
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
deprive
her
of
the
advantage
of
giving
lessons
in
a
house
like
this
but
i
wish
you
to
be
careful
that
the
girls
do
not
copy
her
manners
she
has
not
by
any
means
escaped
the
influence
of
the
company
she
keeps
i
was
utterly
astonished
you
may
well
think
but
i
could
get
no
further
explanation
from
him
he
only
said
that
when
i
wished
to
have
her
society
of
an
evening
i
must
let
him
know
because
he
would
then
dine
at
his
club
not
knowing
the
grounds
of
his
offence
there
was
little
other
argument
i
could
use
than
the
reiteration
of
my
certainty
that
he
must
have
misunderstood
her
in
the
least
he
said
have
no
doubt
she
is
to
you
every
thing
amiable
but
she
has
taken
some
unaccountable
aversion
to
me
and
loses
no
opportunity
of
showing
it
and
i
think
i
deserve
it
i
told
him
i
was
so
sure
he
did
not
deserve
it
that
i
must
believe
there
was
some
mistake
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
raised
his
newspaper
you
must
help
me
little
coz
how
am
i
to
help
you
judy
dear
i
returned
i
ca
interfere
between
husband
and
wife
you
know
if
i
dared
such
a
thing
he
would
quarrel
with
me
too
and
rightly
no
no
she
returned
laughing
i
do
want
your
intercession
i
only
want
you
to
find
out
from
miss
clare
whether
she
knows
how
she
has
so
mortally
offended
my
husband
i
believe
she
knows
nothing
about
it
she
a
rather
abrupt
manner
sometimes
you
know
but
then
my
husband
is
not
so
silly
as
to
have
taken
such
deep
offence
at
that
help
me
now
there
a
dear
i
promised
i
would
and
hence
came
the
story
i
have
already
given
but
marion
was
so
distressed
at
the
result
of
her
words
and
so
anxious
that
judy
should
not
be
hurt
that
she
begged
me
if
i
could
manage
it
without
a
breach
of
verity
to
avoid
disclosing
the
matter
especially
seeing
morley
himself
judged
it
too
heinous
to
impart
to
his
wife
how
to
manage
it
i
could
not
think
but
at
length
we
arranged
it
between
us
i
told
judy
that
marion
confessed
to
having
said
something
which
had
offended
morley
that
she
was
very
sorry
and
hoped
she
need
not
say
that
such
had
not
been
her
intention
but
that
as
morley
evidently
preferred
what
had
passed
between
them
to
remain
unmentioned
to
disclose
it
would
be
merely
to
swell
the
mischief
it
would
be
better
for
them
all
she
requested
me
to
say
that
she
should
give
up
her
lessons
for
the
present
and
therefore
she
hoped
morley
would
excuse
her
when
i
gave
the
message
judy
cried
and
said
nothing
when
the
children
heard
that
marion
was
not
coming
for
a
while
amy
cried
the
other
girls
looked
very
grave
and
the
boys
protested
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
fault
i
most
disliked
in
those
children
was
their
incapacity
for
being
petted
something
of
it
still
remains
but
of
late
i
have
remarked
a
considerable
improvement
in
this
respect
they
have
not
only
grown
in
kindness
but
in
the
gift
of
receiving
kindness
i
can
not
but
attribute
this
in
chief
measure
to
their
illness
and
the
lovely
nursing
of
marion
they
do
not
yet
go
to
their
mother
for
petting
and
from
myself
will
only
endure
it
but
they
are
eager
after
such
crumbs
as
marion
by
no
means
lavish
of
it
will
vouchsafe
them
judy
insisted
that
i
should
let
morley
hear
marion
message
but
the
message
is
not
to
morley
i
said
marion
would
never
have
thought
of
sending
one
to
him
but
if
i
ask
you
to
repeat
it
in
his
hearing
you
will
not
refuse
to
this
i
consented
but
i
fear
she
was
disappointed
in
the
result
her
husband
only
smiled
sarcastically
drew
in
his
chin
and
showed
himself
a
little
more
cheerful
than
usual
one
morning
about
two
months
after
as
i
was
sitting
in
the
with
my
baby
on
the
floor
beside
me
i
was
surprised
to
see
judy
brougham
pull
up
at
the
little
gate
for
it
was
early
when
she
got
out
i
perceived
at
once
that
something
was
amiss
and
ran
to
open
the
door
her
eyes
were
red
and
her
cheeks
ashy
the
moment
we
reached
the
she
sunk
on
the
couch
and
burst
into
tears
judy
i
cried
what
the
matter
is
amy
worse
no
no
cozzy
dear
but
we
are
ruined
we
have
a
penny
in
the
world
the
children
will
be
beggars
and
there
were
the
gay
little
horses
champing
their
bits
at
the
door
and
the
coachman
sitting
in
all
his
glory
erect
and
impassive
i
did
my
best
to
quiet
her
urging
no
questions
with
difficulty
i
got
her
to
swallow
a
glass
of
wine
after
which
with
many
interruptions
and
fresh
outbursts
of
misery
she
managed
to
let
me
understand
that
her
husband
had
been
speculating
and
had
failed
i
could
hardly
believe
myself
awake
morley
was
the
last
man
i
should
have
thought
capable
either
of
speculating
or
of
failing
in
it
if
he
did
knowing
nothing
about
business
i
shall
not
attempt
to
explain
the
particulars
coincident
failures
amongst
his
correspondents
had
contributed
to
his
fall
judy
said
he
had
not
been
like
himself
for
months
but
it
was
only
the
night
before
that
he
had
told
her
they
must
give
up
their
house
in
bolivar
square
and
take
a
small
one
in
the
suburbs
for
any
thing
he
could
see
he
said
he
must
look
out
for
a
situation
still
you
may
be
happier
than
ever
judy
i
can
tell
you
that
happiness
does
not
depend
on
riches
i
said
though
i
could
not
help
crying
with
her
it
a
different
thing
though
after
you
been
used
to
them
she
answered
but
the
question
is
of
bread
for
my
children
not
of
putting
down
my
carriage
she
rose
hurriedly
where
are
you
going
is
there
any
thing
i
can
do
for
you
i
asked
nothing
she
answered
i
left
my
husband
at
baddeley
he
is
as
rich
as
croesus
and
could
write
him
a
check
that
would
float
him
he
too
rich
to
be
generous
i
afraid
i
said
what
do
you
mean
by
that
she
asked
if
he
be
so
generous
how
does
it
come
that
he
is
so
rich
why
his
father
made
the
money
then
he
most
likely
takes
after
his
father
percivale
says
he
does
not
believe
a
huge
fortune
was
ever
made
of
nothing
without
such
pinching
of
one
self
and
such
scraping
of
others
or
else
such
speculation
as
is
essentially
dishonorable
he
stands
high
murmured
judy
hopelessly
whether
what
is
dishonorable
be
also
disreputable
depends
on
how
many
there
are
of
his
own
sort
in
the
society
in
which
he
moves
now
coz
you
know
nothing
to
his
discredit
and
he
our
last
hope
i
will
say
no
more
i
answered
i
hope
i
may
be
quite
wrong
only
i
should
expect
nothing
of
when
she
reached
baddeley
her
husband
was
gone
having
driven
to
his
and
been
shown
into
his
private
room
she
found
him
there
with
his
head
between
his
hands
the
great
man
had
declined
doing
any
thing
for
him
and
had
even
rebuked
him
for
his
imprudence
without
wasting
a
thought
on
the
fact
that
every
penny
he
himself
possessed
was
the
result
of
the
boldest
speculation
on
the
part
of
his
father
a
very
few
days
only
would
elapse
before
the
falling
due
of
certain
bills
must
at
once
disclose
the
state
of
his
affairs
as
soon
as
she
had
left
me
percivale
not
being
at
home
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
went
to
find
marion
i
must
tell
every
thing
that
caused
me
either
joy
or
sorrow
and
besides
she
had
all
the
right
that
love
could
give
to
know
of
judy
distress
i
knew
all
her
engagements
and
therefore
where
to
find
her
and
sent
in
my
card
with
the
pencilled
intimation
that
i
would
wait
the
close
of
her
lesson
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
out
and
got
into
the
cab
at
once
i
told
her
my
sad
news
could
you
take
me
to
cambridge
square
to
my
next
engagement
she
said
i
was
considerably
surprised
at
the
cool
way
in
which
she
received
the
communication
but
of
course
i
gave
the
necessary
directions
is
there
any
thing
to
be
done
she
asked
after
a
pause
i
know
of
nothing
i
answered
again
she
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
one
ca
move
without
knowing
all
the
circumstances
and
particulars
she
said
at
length
and
how
to
get
at
them
he
would
make
a
confidante
of
she
said
smiling
sadly
ah
you
little
think
what
vast
sums
are
concerned
in
such
a
failure
as
his
i
remarked
astounded
that
one
with
her
knowledge
of
the
world
should
talk
as
she
did
it
will
be
best
she
said
after
still
another
pause
to
go
to
blackstone
he
has
a
wonderful
acquaintance
with
business
for
a
clergyman
and
knows
many
of
the
city
people
what
could
any
clergyman
do
in
such
a
case
i
returned
for
blackstone
morley
would
not
accept
even
consolation
at
his
hands
the
time
for
that
is
not
come
yet
said
marion
we
must
try
to
help
him
some
other
way
first
we
will
if
we
can
make
friends
with
him
by
means
of
the
very
mammon
that
has
all
but
ruined
him
she
spoke
of
the
great
merchant
just
as
she
might
of
richard
or
any
of
the
bricklayers
or
mechanics
whose
spiritual
condition
she
pondered
that
she
might
aid
it
but
what
could
blackstone
do
i
insisted
all
i
should
want
of
him
would
be
to
find
out
for
me
what
liabilities
are
and
how
much
would
serve
to
tide
him
over
the
bar
of
his
present
difficulties
i
suspect
he
has
few
friends
who
would
risk
any
thing
for
him
i
understand
he
is
no
favorite
in
the
city
and
if
friendship
do
not
come
in
he
must
be
stranded
you
believe
him
an
honorable
man
do
you
not
she
asked
abruptly
it
never
entered
my
head
to
doubt
it
i
replied
the
moment
we
reached
cambridge
square
she
jumped
out
ran
up
the
steps
and
knocked
at
the
door
i
waited
wondering
if
she
was
going
to
leave
me
thus
without
a
farewell
when
the
door
was
opened
she
merely
gave
a
message
to
the
man
and
the
same
instant
was
again
in
the
cab
by
my
side
now
i
am
free
she
said
and
told
the
man
to
drive
to
mile
end
i
fear
i
ca
go
with
you
so
far
marion
i
said
i
must
go
home
i
have
so
much
to
see
to
and
you
can
do
quite
as
well
without
me
i
know
what
you
intend
but
do
let
any
thing
come
out
i
can
trust
but
if
you
can
trust
me
i
can
trust
blackstone
he
is
the
most
cautious
man
in
the
world
shall
i
get
out
and
take
another
cab
no
you
can
drop
me
at
tottenham
court
road
and
i
will
go
home
by
omnibus
but
you
must
let
me
pay
the
cab
no
no
i
am
richer
than
you
i
have
no
children
what
fun
it
is
to
spend
money
for
morley
and
lay
him
under
an
obligation
he
will
never
know
she
said
laughing
the
result
of
her
endeavors
was
that
blackstone
by
a
circuitous
succession
of
introductions
reached
morley
confidential
clerk
whom
he
was
able
so
far
to
satisfy
concerning
his
object
in
desiring
the
information
that
he
made
him
a
full
disclosure
of
the
condition
of
affairs
and
stated
what
sum
would
be
sufficient
to
carry
them
over
their
difficulties
though
he
added
the
greatest
care
and
every
possible
reduction
of
expenditure
for
some
years
would
be
indispensable
to
their
complete
restoration
blackstone
carried
his
discoveries
to
miss
clare
and
she
to
lady
bernard
my
dear
marion
said
lady
bernard
this
is
a
serious
matter
you
suggest
the
man
may
be
honest
and
yet
it
may
be
of
no
use
trying
to
help
him
i
do
want
to
bolster
him
up
for
a
few
months
in
order
to
see
my
money
go
after
his
that
not
what
i
got
to
do
with
it
no
doubt
i
could
lose
as
much
as
you
mention
without
being
crippled
by
it
for
i
hope
it
no
disgrace
in
me
to
be
rich
as
it
none
in
you
to
be
poor
but
i
hate
waste
and
i
will
be
guilty
of
it
if
morley
will
convince
me
and
any
friend
or
man
of
business
to
whom
i
may
refer
the
matter
that
there
is
good
probability
of
his
recovering
himself
by
means
of
it
then
and
not
till
then
i
shall
feel
justified
in
risking
the
amount
for
as
you
say
it
would
prevent
much
misery
to
many
besides
that
creature
morley
and
her
children
it
is
worth
doing
if
it
can
be
done
not
worth
trying
if
it
ca
shall
i
write
for
you
and
ask
him
to
come
and
see
you
no
my
dear
if
i
do
a
kindness
i
must
do
it
humbly
it
is
a
great
liberty
to
take
with
a
man
to
offer
him
a
kindness
i
must
go
to
him
i
could
not
use
the
same
freedom
with
a
man
in
misfortune
as
with
one
in
prosperity
i
would
have
such
a
one
feel
that
his
money
or
his
poverty
made
no
difference
to
me
and
morley
wants
that
lesson
if
any
man
does
besides
after
all
i
may
not
be
able
to
do
it
for
him
and
he
would
have
good
reason
to
be
hurt
if
i
had
made
him
dance
attendance
on
me
the
same
evening
lady
bernard
shabby
stopped
at
morley
door
she
asked
to
see
morley
and
through
her
had
an
interview
with
her
husband
without
circumlocution
she
told
him
that
if
he
would
lay
his
affairs
before
her
and
a
certain
accountant
she
named
to
use
their
judgment
regarding
them
in
the
hope
of
finding
it
possible
to
serve
him
they
would
wait
upon
him
for
that
purpose
at
any
time
and
place
he
pleased
morley
expressed
his
obligation
not
very
warmly
she
said
repudiating
however
the
slightest
objection
to
her
knowing
now
what
all
the
world
must
know
the
next
day
but
one
early
the
following
morning
lady
bernard
and
the
accountant
met
morley
at
his
place
in
the
city
and
by
three
in
the
afternoon
fifteen
thousand
pounds
were
handed
in
to
his
account
at
his
banker
the
carriage
was
put
down
the
butler
one
of
the
footmen
and
the
maid
were
dismissed
and
household
arrangements
fitted
to
a
different
scale
one
consequence
of
this
chastisement
as
of
the
preceding
was
that
the
whole
family
drew
yet
more
closely
and
lovingly
together
and
i
must
say
for
judy
that
after
a
few
weeks
of
what
she
called
poverty
her
spirits
seemed
in
no
degree
the
worse
for
the
trial
at
marion
earnest
entreaty
no
one
told
either
or
morley
of
the
share
she
had
had
in
saving
his
credit
and
social
position
for
some
time
she
suffered
from
doubt
as
to
whether
she
had
had
any
right
to
interpose
in
the
matter
and
might
not
have
injured
morley
by
depriving
him
of
the
discipline
of
poverty
but
she
reasoned
with
herself
that
had
it
been
necessary
for
him
her
efforts
would
have
been
frustrated
and
reminded
herself
that
although
his
commercial
credit
had
escaped
it
must
still
be
a
considerable
trial
to
him
to
live
in
reduced
style
but
that
it
was
not
all
the
trial
needful
for
him
was
soon
apparent
for
his
favorite
amy
began
to
pine
more
rapidly
and
judy
saw
that
except
some
change
speedily
took
place
they
could
not
have
her
with
them
long
the
father
however
refused
to
admit
the
idea
that
she
was
in
danger
i
suppose
he
felt
as
if
were
he
once
to
allow
the
possibility
of
losing
her
from
that
moment
there
would
be
no
stay
between
her
and
the
grave
it
would
be
a
giving
of
her
over
to
death
but
whatever
dr
brand
suggested
was
eagerly
followed
when
the
chills
of
autumn
drew
near
her
mother
took
her
to
ventnor
but
little
change
followed
and
before
the
new
year
she
was
gone
it
was
the
first
death
beyond
that
of
an
infant
they
had
had
in
their
family
and
took
place
at
a
time
when
the
pressure
of
business
obligations
rendered
it
impossible
for
her
father
to
be
out
of
london
he
could
only
go
to
lay
her
in
the
earth
and
bring
back
his
wife
judy
had
never
seen
him
weep
before
certainly
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
a
man
he
was
literally
bowed
with
grief
as
if
he
bore
a
material
burden
on
his
back
the
best
feelings
of
his
nature
unimpeded
by
any
jar
to
his
or
his
prejudices
had
been
able
to
spend
themselves
on
the
lovely
little
creature
and
i
do
not
believe
any
other
suffering
than
the
loss
of
such
a
child
could
have
brought
into
play
that
in
him
which
was
purely
human
he
was
at
home
one
morning
ill
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
when
marion
called
on
judy
while
she
waited
in
the
he
entered
he
turned
the
moment
he
saw
her
but
had
not
taken
two
steps
towards
the
door
when
he
turned
again
and
approached
her
she
went
to
meet
him
he
held
out
his
hand
she
was
very
fond
of
you
miss
clare
he
said
she
was
talking
about
you
the
very
last
time
i
saw
her
let
be
between
us
i
was
very
rough
and
rude
to
you
morley
and
i
am
very
sorry
said
marion
but
you
spoke
the
truth
he
rejoined
i
thought
i
was
above
being
spoken
to
like
a
sinner
but
i
do
know
now
why
not
he
sat
down
on
a
couch
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
marion
took
a
chair
near
him
but
could
not
speak
it
is
very
hard
he
murmured
at
length
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
said
marion
that
may
be
true
in
some
cases
but
i
have
no
right
to
believe
it
applies
to
me
he
loved
the
child
i
would
fain
believe
for
i
dare
not
think
of
her
either
as
having
ceased
to
be
or
as
alone
in
the
world
to
which
she
has
gone
you
do
think
miss
clare
do
you
not
that
we
shall
know
our
friends
in
another
world
i
believe
answered
marion
that
god
sent
you
that
child
for
the
express
purpose
of
enticing
you
back
to
himself
and
if
i
believe
any
thing
at
all
i
believe
that
the
gifts
of
god
are
without
repentance
whether
or
not
he
understood
her
she
could
not
tell
for
at
this
point
judy
came
in
seeing
them
together
she
would
have
withdrawn
again
but
her
husband
called
her
with
more
tenderness
in
his
voice
than
marion
could
have
imagined
belonging
to
it
come
my
dear
miss
clare
and
i
were
talking
about
our
little
angel
i
did
think
ever
to
speak
of
her
again
but
i
fear
i
am
growing
foolish
all
the
strength
is
out
of
me
and
i
feel
so
tired
so
weary
of
every
thing
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
marion
crept
away
to
the
children
an
hour
after
judy
found
her
in
the
nursery
with
the
youngest
on
her
knee
and
the
rest
all
about
her
she
was
telling
them
that
we
were
sent
into
this
world
to
learn
to
be
good
and
then
go
back
to
god
from
whom
we
came
like
little
amy
when
i
go
out
said
one
little
fellow
about
four
years
old
i
look
up
into
the
sky
vewy
hard
wight
up
and
then
i
shall
see
amy
and
god
saying
to
her
poo
amy
you
bette
now
amy
i
mawion
she
had
taught
them
to
call
her
marion
no
my
pet
you
might
look
and
look
all
day
long
and
every
day
and
never
see
god
or
amy
then
they
there
he
exclaimed
indignantly
god
is
there
anyhow
she
answered
only
you
ca
see
him
that
way
i
do
care
about
seeing
god
said
the
next
elder
it
amy
i
want
to
see
do
tell
me
marion
how
we
are
to
see
amy
it
too
bad
if
we
never
to
see
her
again
and
i
do
think
it
fair
i
will
tell
you
the
only
way
i
know
when
jesus
was
in
the
world
he
told
us
that
all
who
had
clean
hearts
should
see
god
that
how
jesus
himself
saw
god
it
amy
i
tell
you
marion
it
not
god
i
want
to
see
insisted
the
one
who
had
last
spoken
well
my
dear
but
how
can
you
see
amy
if
you
ca
even
see
god
if
amy
be
in
god
arms
the
first
thing
in
order
to
find
her
is
to
find
god
to
be
good
is
the
only
way
to
get
near
to
anybody
when
you
naughty
willie
you
ca
get
near
your
mamma
can
you
yes
i
can
i
can
get
close
up
to
her
is
that
near
enough
would
you
be
quite
content
with
that
even
when
she
turns
away
her
face
and
wo
look
at
you
the
little
caviller
was
silent
did
you
ever
see
god
marion
asked
one
of
the
girls
she
thought
for
a
moment
before
giving
an
answer
no
she
said
seen
things
just
after
he
had
done
them
and
i
think
i
heard
him
speak
to
me
but
i
never
seen
him
yet
then
you
not
good
marion
said
the
of
the
group
no
that
just
it
but
i
hope
to
be
good
some
day
and
then
i
see
him
how
do
you
grow
good
marion
asked
the
girl
god
is
always
trying
to
make
me
good
she
answered
and
i
try
not
to
interfere
with
him
but
sometimes
you
forget
do
you
yes
i
do
and
what
do
you
do
then
then
i
sorry
and
unhappy
and
begin
to
try
again
and
god
do
mind
much
does
he
he
minds
very
much
until
i
mind
but
after
that
he
forgets
it
all
takes
all
my
naughtiness
and
throws
it
behind
his
back
and
wo
look
at
it
that
very
good
of
god
said
the
reasoner
but
with
such
a
air
in
his
approval
that
marion
thought
it
time
to
stop
she
came
straight
to
me
and
told
me
with
a
face
perfectly
radiant
of
the
alteration
in
morley
behavior
to
her
and
what
was
of
much
more
consequence
the
evident
change
that
had
begun
to
be
wrought
in
him
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
he
has
as
yet
shown
a
very
shining
light
but
that
some
change
has
passed
is
evident
in
the
whole
man
of
him
i
think
the
eternal
wind
must
now
be
able
to
get
in
through
some
chink
or
other
which
the
loss
of
his
child
has
left
behind
and
if
the
change
were
not
going
on
surely
he
would
ere
now
have
returned
to
his
wallowing
in
the
mire
of
mammon
for
his
former
fortune
is
i
understand
all
but
restored
to
him
i
fancy
his
growth
in
goodness
might
be
known
and
measured
by
his
progress
in
appreciating
marion
he
still
regards
her
as
extreme
in
her
notions
but
it
is
curious
to
see
how
as
they
gradually
sink
into
his
understanding
he
comes
to
adopt
them
as
and
even
to
mistake
them
for
his
own
chapter
xxix
a
strange
text
for
some
time
after
the
events
last
related
things
went
on
pretty
smoothly
with
us
for
several
years
indeed
although
i
must
confess
that
what
i
said
in
my
haste
when
wanted
me
to
write
this
book
namely
that
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
me
worth
telling
was
by
no
means
correct
and
that
i
have
found
out
my
mistake
in
the
process
of
writing
it
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
granted
that
my
story
could
never
have
reached
the
mere
bulk
required
if
i
had
not
largely
drawn
upon
the
history
of
my
friends
to
supplement
my
own
and
it
needs
no
prophetic
gift
to
foresee
that
it
will
be
the
same
to
the
end
of
the
book
the
lives
of
these
friends
however
have
had
so
much
to
do
with
all
that
is
most
precious
to
me
in
our
own
life
that
if
i
were
to
leave
out
only
all
that
did
not
immediately
touch
upon
the
latter
the
book
whatever
it
might
appear
to
others
could
not
possibly
then
appear
to
myself
any
thing
like
a
real
representation
of
my
actual
life
and
experiences
the
drawing
might
be
correct
but
the
color
what
with
my
children
and
the
increase
of
social
duty
resulting
from
the
growth
of
acquaintance
occasioned
in
part
by
my
success
in
persuading
percivale
to
mingle
a
little
more
with
his
my
heart
and
mind
and
hands
were
all
pretty
fully
occupied
but
i
still
managed
to
see
marion
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
to
spend
about
so
many
hours
with
her
sometimes
alone
sometimes
with
her
friends
as
well
her
society
did
much
to
keep
my
heart
open
and
to
prevent
it
from
becoming
selfishly
absorbed
in
its
cares
for
husband
and
children
for
love
which
is
concentrating
its
force
that
is
which
is
not
at
the
same
time
widening
its
circle
is
itself
doomed
and
for
its
objects
ruinous
be
those
objects
ever
so
sacred
god
himself
could
never
be
content
that
his
children
should
love
him
only
nor
has
he
allowed
the
few
to
succeed
who
have
tried
after
it
perhaps
their
divinest
success
has
been
their
most
mortifying
failure
indeed
for
exclusive
love
sharp
suffering
is
often
sent
as
the
needful
cure
needful
to
break
the
stony
crust
which
in
the
name
of
love
for
one
own
gathers
about
the
divinely
glowing
core
a
crust
which
promising
to
cherish
by
keeping
in
the
heat
would
yet
gradually
thicken
until
all
was
crust
for
truly
in
things
of
the
heart
and
spirit
as
the
warmth
ceases
to
spread
the
molten
mass
within
ceases
to
glow
until
at
length
but
for
the
divine
care
and
discipline
there
would
be
no
love
left
for
even
spouse
or
child
only
for
self
which
is
eternal
death
for
some
time
i
had
seen
a
considerable
change
in
roger
it
reached
even
to
his
dress
hitherto
when
got
up
for
dinner
he
was
what
i
was
astonished
to
hear
my
eldest
boy
the
other
day
call
a
howling
swell
but
at
other
times
he
did
not
even
escape
remark
not
for
the
oddity
merely
but
the
slovenliness
of
his
attire
he
had
worn
for
more
years
than
i
dare
guess
a
brown
coat
of
some
stuff
whose
long
pile
was
stuck
together
in
many
places
with
spots
and
dabs
of
paint
so
that
he
looked
like
our
bedlington
terrier
fido
towards
the
end
of
the
week
in
muddy
weather
this
was
now
discarded
so
far
at
least
as
to
be
hung
up
in
his
brother
study
to
be
at
hand
when
he
did
any
thing
for
him
there
and
replaced
by
a
more
civilized
garment
of
tweed
of
which
he
actually
showed
himself
a
little
careful
while
if
his
necktie
red
it
was
of
a
very
deep
and
rich
red
and
he
had
seldom
worn
one
at
all
before
and
his
felt
hat
was
exchanged
for
one
of
half
the
altitude
which
he
did
not
crush
on
his
head
with
quite
as
many
indentations
as
its
surface
could
hold
he
also
began
to
go
to
church
with
us
sometimes
but
there
was
a
greater
and
more
significant
change
than
any
of
these
we
found
that
he
was
sticking
more
steadily
to
work
i
can
hardly
say
work
for
he
was
as
i
have
already
indicated
he
had
a
small
income
left
him
by
an
old
maiden
aunt
with
whom
he
had
been
a
favorite
which
had
hitherto
seemed
to
do
him
nothing
but
harm
enabling
him
to
alternate
fits
of
comparative
diligence
with
fits
of
positive
idleness
i
have
said
also
i
believe
that
although
he
could
do
nothing
thoroughly
application
alone
was
wanted
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
himself
in
more
than
one
thing
his
forte
was
engraving
on
wood
and
my
husband
said
that
if
he
could
do
so
well
with
so
little
practice
as
he
had
had
he
must
be
capable
of
becoming
an
admirable
engraver
to
our
delight
then
we
discovered
all
at
once
that
he
had
been
working
steadily
for
three
months
for
the
d
whose
place
was
not
far
from
our
house
he
had
said
nothing
about
it
to
his
brother
probably
from
having
good
reason
to
fear
that
he
would
regard
it
only
as
a
having
now
however
executed
a
block
which
greatly
pleased
himself
he
had
brought
a
proof
impression
to
show
percivale
who
more
pleased
with
it
than
even
roger
himself
gave
him
a
hearty
congratulation
and
told
him
it
would
be
a
shame
if
he
did
not
bring
his
execution
in
that
art
to
perfection
from
which
judging
by
the
present
specimen
he
said
it
could
not
be
far
off
the
words
brought
into
roger
face
an
expression
of
modest
gratification
which
it
rejoiced
me
to
behold
he
accepted
approbation
more
like
a
son
than
a
brother
with
a
humid
glow
in
his
eyes
and
hardly
a
word
on
his
lips
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
child
in
his
heart
had
begun
to
throw
off
the
swaddling
clothes
which
foolish
manhood
had
wrapped
around
it
and
the
germ
of
his
being
was
about
to
assert
itself
i
have
seldom
indeed
seen
percivale
look
so
pleased
do
me
a
dozen
as
good
as
that
he
said
and
i
have
the
proofs
framed
in
silver
gilt
it
been
done
but
the
proofs
had
to
wait
longer
for
the
frame
than
percivale
for
the
proofs
but
he
need
have
held
out
no
such
bribe
of
brotherly
love
for
there
was
another
love
already
at
work
in
himself
more
than
sufficing
to
the
affair
but
i
check
myself
who
shall
say
what
love
is
sufficing
for
this
or
for
that
who
with
the
most
enduring
and
most
passionate
love
his
heart
can
hold
will
venture
to
say
that
he
could
have
done
without
the
love
of
a
brother
who
will
say
that
he
could
have
done
without
the
love
of
the
dog
whose
bones
have
lain
mouldering
in
his
garden
for
twenty
years
it
is
enough
to
say
that
there
was
a
more
engrossing
a
more
marvellous
love
at
work
roger
always
however
took
a
on
saturdays
and
now
generally
came
to
us
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
said
to
him
would
you
like
to
come
and
hear
marion
play
to
her
friends
this
evening
roger
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
he
answered
and
we
went
it
was
delightful
in
my
opinion
marion
is
a
real
artist
i
do
not
claim
for
her
the
higher
art
of
origination
though
i
could
claim
for
her
a
much
higher
faculty
than
the
artistic
itself
i
suspect
for
instance
that
moses
was
a
greater
man
than
the
writer
of
the
book
of
job
notwithstanding
that
the
poet
moves
me
so
much
more
than
the
divine
politician
marion
combined
in
a
wonderful
way
the
critical
faculty
with
the
artistic
which
two
however
much
of
the
one
may
be
found
without
the
other
are
mutually
essential
to
the
perfection
of
each
while
she
uttered
from
herself
she
heard
with
her
audience
while
she
played
and
sung
with
her
own
fingers
and
mouth
she
at
the
same
time
listened
with
their
ears
knowing
what
they
must
feel
as
well
as
what
she
meant
to
utter
and
hence
it
was
i
think
that
she
came
into
such
vital
contact
with
them
even
through
her
piano
as
we
returned
home
roger
said
after
some
remark
of
mine
of
a
cognate
sort
does
she
never
try
to
teach
them
any
thing
ethel
she
is
constantly
teaching
them
whether
she
tries
or
not
i
answered
if
you
can
make
any
one
believe
that
there
is
something
somewhere
to
be
trusted
is
not
that
the
best
lesson
you
can
give
him
that
can
be
taught
only
by
being
such
that
people
can
not
but
trust
you
i
did
need
to
be
told
that
he
answered
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
or
not
she
ever
teaches
them
by
word
of
mouth
an
ordinary
and
inferior
mode
if
you
will
if
you
had
ever
heard
her
you
would
not
call
hers
an
ordinary
or
inferior
mode
i
returned
her
teaching
is
the
outcome
of
her
life
the
blossom
of
her
being
and
therefore
has
the
whole
force
of
her
living
truth
to
back
it
have
i
offended
you
ethel
he
asked
then
i
saw
that
in
my
eagerness
to
glorify
my
friend
i
had
made
myself
unpleasant
to
roger
a
fault
of
which
i
had
been
dimly
conscious
before
now
marion
would
never
have
fallen
into
that
error
she
always
made
her
friends
feel
that
she
was
them
side
by
side
with
them
and
turning
her
face
in
the
same
direction
before
she
attempted
to
lead
them
farther
i
assured
him
that
he
had
not
offended
me
but
that
i
had
been
foolishly
backing
him
from
the
front
as
i
once
heard
an
irishman
say
some
of
whose
bulls
were
very
good
milch
cows
she
teaches
them
every
sunday
evening
i
added
have
you
ever
heard
her
more
than
once
and
i
never
heard
any
thing
like
it
could
you
take
me
with
you
some
time
he
asked
in
an
assumed
tone
of
ordinary
interest
out
of
which
however
he
could
not
keep
a
slight
tremble
i
do
know
i
do
quite
see
why
i
should
and
yet
men
do
go
urged
roger
as
if
it
were
a
mere
suggestion
oh
yes
you
would
have
plenty
to
keep
you
in
countenance
i
returned
men
enough
and
worth
teaching
too
some
of
them
at
least
then
i
do
see
why
she
should
object
to
me
for
another
i
do
know
that
she
would
you
are
not
exactly
of
the
sort
you
know
that
i
do
see
the
difference
i
see
no
essential
difference
at
least
the
main
thing
is
that
i
am
in
want
of
teaching
as
much
as
any
of
them
and
if
she
stands
on
circumstances
i
am
a
as
much
as
any
of
them
perhaps
more
than
most
of
them
few
of
them
work
after
midnight
i
should
think
as
i
do
not
unfrequently
still
all
admitted
i
should
hardly
like
i
did
mean
you
were
to
take
me
without
asking
her
he
said
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
that
and
if
i
were
to
ask
her
i
am
certain
she
would
refuse
but
i
added
thinking
over
the
matter
a
little
i
will
take
you
without
asking
her
come
with
me
night
i
do
think
she
will
have
the
heart
to
send
you
away
i
will
he
answered
with
more
gladness
in
his
voice
than
he
intended
i
think
to
manifest
itself
we
arranged
that
he
should
call
for
me
at
a
certain
hour
i
told
percivale
and
he
pretended
to
grumble
that
i
was
taking
roger
instead
of
him
it
was
roger
and
not
you
that
made
the
request
i
returned
i
say
i
see
why
you
should
go
because
roger
asked
a
woman
logic
is
not
equal
to
that
i
did
mean
he
was
to
go
but
why
should
i
be
done
good
to
as
well
as
he
if
you
really
want
to
go
i
said
i
do
see
why
you
should
ever
so
much
better
than
going
to
any
church
i
know
of
except
one
but
we
must
be
prudent
i
ca
take
more
than
one
the
first
time
we
must
get
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
in
first
and
you
count
roger
the
thin
edge
yes
i
tell
him
so
do
the
thin
edge
mind
without
which
the
thicker
the
rest
is
the
more
useless
tell
him
that
if
you
like
but
seriously
i
quite
expect
to
take
you
there
too
the
sunday
after
roger
and
i
went
intending
to
be
a
little
late
we
found
when
we
readied
the
house
that
as
we
had
wished
the
class
was
already
begun
in
going
up
the
stairs
we
saw
very
few
of
the
grown
inhabitants
but
in
several
of
the
rooms
of
which
the
doors
stood
open
elder
girls
taking
care
of
the
younger
children
in
one
a
boy
nursing
the
baby
with
as
much
interest
as
any
girl
could
have
shown
we
lingered
on
the
way
wishing
to
give
marion
time
to
get
so
thoroughly
into
her
work
that
she
could
take
no
notice
of
our
intrusion
when
we
reached
the
last
stair
we
could
at
length
hear
her
voice
of
which
the
first
words
we
could
distinguish
as
we
still
ascended
were
i
will
now
read
to
you
the
chapter
of
which
i
spoke
the
door
being
open
we
could
hear
well
enough
although
she
was
sitting
where
we
could
not
see
her
we
would
not
show
ourselves
until
the
reading
was
ended
so
much
at
least
we
might
overhear
without
offence
before
she
had
read
many
words
roger
and
i
began
to
cast
strange
looks
on
each
other
for
this
was
the
chapter
she
read
and
joseph
wheresoever
he
went
in
the
city
took
the
lord
jesus
with
him
where
he
was
sent
for
to
work
to
make
gates
or
or
sieves
or
boxes
the
lord
jesus
was
with
him
wheresoever
he
went
and
as
often
as
joseph
had
any
thing
in
his
work
to
make
longer
or
shorter
or
wider
or
narrower
the
lord
jesus
would
stretch
his
hand
towards
it
and
presently
it
became
as
joseph
would
have
it
so
that
he
had
no
need
to
finish
any
thing
with
his
own
hands
for
he
was
not
very
skilful
at
his
trade
on
a
certain
time
the
king
of
jerusalem
sent
for
him
and
said
i
would
have
thee
make
me
a
throne
of
the
same
dimensions
with
that
place
in
which
i
commonly
sit
joseph
obeyed
and
forthwith
began
the
work
and
continued
two
years
in
the
king
palace
before
he
finished
and
when
he
came
to
fix
it
in
its
place
he
found
it
wanted
two
spans
on
each
side
of
the
appointed
measure
which
when
the
king
saw
he
was
very
angry
with
joseph
and
joseph
afraid
of
the
king
anger
went
to
bed
without
his
supper
taking
not
any
thing
to
eat
then
the
lord
jesus
asked
him
what
he
was
afraid
of
joseph
replied
because
i
have
lost
my
labor
in
the
work
which
i
have
been
about
these
two
years
jesus
said
to
him
fear
not
neither
be
cast
down
do
thou
lay
hold
on
one
side
of
the
throne
and
i
will
the
other
and
we
will
bring
it
to
its
just
dimensions
and
when
joseph
had
done
as
the
lord
jesus
said
and
each
of
them
had
with
strength
drawn
his
side
the
throne
obeyed
and
was
brought
to
the
proper
dimensions
of
the
place
which
miracle
when
they
who
stood
by
saw
they
were
astonished
and
praised
god
the
throne
was
made
of
the
same
wood
which
was
in
being
in
solomon
time
namely
wood
adorned
with
various
shapes
and
figures
her
voice
ceased
and
a
pause
followed
we
must
go
in
now
i
whispered
she
be
going
to
say
something
now
just
wait
till
she
started
said
roger
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
marion
in
a
meditative
tone
we
crept
within
the
scope
of
her
vision
and
stood
a
voice
which
i
knew
was
at
the
moment
replying
to
her
question
do
think
it
much
of
a
chapter
that
grannie
the
speaker
was
the
elderly
man
with
whiskers
who
had
come
forward
to
talk
to
percivale
on
that
miserable
evening
when
we
were
out
searching
for
little
ethel
he
sat
near
where
we
stood
by
the
door
between
two
respectable
looking
women
who
had
been
listening
to
the
chapter
as
devoutly
as
if
it
had
been
of
the
true
gospel
sure
grannie
that
ai
out
o
the
bible
said
another
voice
from
somewhere
farther
off
we
talk
about
that
presently
answered
marion
i
want
to
hear
what
jarvis
has
to
say
to
it
he
a
carpenter
himself
you
see
a
joiner
that
is
you
know
all
the
faces
in
the
room
were
now
turned
towards
jarvis
tell
me
why
you
do
think
much
of
it
jarvis
said
marion
a
bit
likely
he
answered
what
is
likely
why
not
one
single
thing
in
the
whole
kit
of
it
and
first
and
foremost
a
bit
likely
the
old
man
ha
been
sich
a
duffer
why
not
there
must
have
been
stupid
people
then
as
well
as
now
not
father
said
jarvis
decidedly
he
was
but
his
like
you
know
jarvis
remarked
the
woman
beside
him
in
a
low
voice
well
he
never
ha
been
then
would
ha
had
a
word
to
say
to
i
have
seen
a
good
and
wise
woman
too
with
a
dull
husband
said
marion
you
know
you
do
believe
a
word
of
it
yourself
grannie
said
still
another
voice
besides
she
went
on
without
heeding
the
interruption
in
those
times
i
suspect
such
things
were
mostly
managed
by
the
parents
and
the
woman
herself
had
little
to
do
with
them
a
murmur
of
subdued
indignation
arose
chiefly
of
female
voices
well
would
then
said
jarvis
he
might
have
been
rich
suggested
marion
i
go
bail
never
made
the
money
then
said
jarvis
an
old
idget
i
do
believe
sich
a
feller
ha
been
marry
a
woman
like
her
i
you
mean
you
do
think
god
would
have
let
him
well
that
what
i
mean
grannie
the
thing
could
ha
been
nohow
i
agree
with
you
quite
and
now
i
want
to
hear
more
of
what
in
the
story
you
do
consider
likely
well
it
ai
likely
sich
a
workman
ha
stood
so
high
i
the
trade
that
the
king
of
jerusalem
would
ha
sent
for
of
all
the
tradesmen
in
the
town
to
make
his
new
throne
for
him
no
more
it
ai
likely
and
let
him
be
as
big
a
duffer
as
ever
was
to
be
a
jiner
at
all
that
he
been
two
year
at
work
on
that
there
throne
an
a
carvin
of
it
in
figures
too
and
never
found
out
it
was
four
spans
too
narrer
for
the
place
it
had
to
stand
in
do
ye
to
know
now
grannie
how
much
is
a
span
i
do
know
do
you
know
mrs
percivale
the
sudden
reference
took
me
very
much
by
surprise
but
i
had
not
forgotten
happily
the
answer
i
received
to
the
same
question
when
anxious
to
realize
the
monstrous
height
of
goliath
i
remember
my
father
telling
me
i
replied
that
it
was
as
much
as
you
could
stretch
between
your
thumb
and
little
finger
there
cried
jarvis
triumphantly
parting
the
extreme
members
of
his
right
hand
against
the
back
of
the
woman
in
front
of
him
that
would
be
seven
or
eight
inches
four
times
that
two
foot
and
a
half
at
least
think
of
that
i
admit
the
force
of
both
your
objections
said
marion
and
now
to
turn
to
a
more
important
part
of
the
story
what
do
you
think
of
the
way
in
which
according
to
it
he
got
his
father
out
of
his
evil
plight
i
saw
plainly
enough
that
she
was
quietly
advancing
towards
some
point
in
her
view
guiding
the
talk
thitherward
steadily
without
haste
or
effort
before
jarvis
had
time
to
make
any
reply
the
blind
man
mentioned
in
a
former
chapter
struck
in
with
the
tone
of
one
who
had
been
watching
his
opportunity
make
more
o
that
pint
than
the
he
said
a
man
as
is
a
duffer
may
well
make
a
mull
of
a
thing
but
a
man
as
knows
what
he
up
to
ca
i
do
make
much
o
them
miracles
you
know
grannie
that
is
i
do
know
and
what
i
do
know
i
wo
say
as
i
knows
but
what
sure
of
is
this
here
one
thing
that
man
or
boy
as
work
a
miracle
you
know
grannie
would
work
no
miracle
as
there
was
no
good
working
of
it
was
to
help
his
father
suggested
marion
here
jarvis
broke
in
almost
with
scorn
to
help
him
to
pass
for
a
clever
fellow
when
he
was
as
great
a
duffer
as
ever
broke
bread
i
quite
o
your
opinion
jarvis
said
the
blind
man
it
been
more
like
him
to
tell
his
father
what
a
duffer
he
was
and
send
him
home
to
learn
his
trade
he
could
do
that
you
know
said
marion
gently
he
use
such
words
to
his
father
if
he
were
ever
so
stupid
his
grannie
suggested
the
woman
who
had
corrected
jarvis
on
the
same
point
she
spoke
very
modestly
but
was
clearly
bent
on
holding
forth
what
light
she
had
certainly
renton
but
you
know
he
could
be
rude
to
any
one
leaving
his
own
mother
husband
out
of
the
question
true
for
you
grannie
returned
the
woman
i
think
though
said
jarvis
for
as
hard
as
he
ha
found
it
it
would
ha
been
more
like
him
to
set
to
work
and
teach
his
father
than
to
scamp
up
his
mulls
certainly
acquiesced
marion
to
hide
any
man
faults
and
leave
him
not
only
stupid
but
in
all
probability
obstinate
and
would
not
be
like
suppose
our
lord
had
had
such
a
father
what
do
you
think
he
would
have
done
he
ha
done
all
he
could
to
make
a
man
of
him
answered
jarvis
would
he
have
set
about
making
him
comfortable
then
in
spite
of
his
blunders
said
marion
a
significant
silence
followed
this
question
well
not
first
thing
i
do
think
returned
jarvis
at
length
he
ha
got
him
o
some
good
first
and
gone
in
to
make
him
comfortable
arter
then
i
suppose
you
would
rather
be
of
some
good
and
uncomfortable
than
of
no
good
and
comfortable
said
marion
i
hope
so
grannie
answered
jarvis
and
would
yes
that
i
would
came
from
several
voices
in
the
little
crowd
showing
what
an
influence
marion
must
have
already
had
upon
them
then
she
said
and
i
saw
by
the
light
which
rose
in
her
eyes
that
she
was
now
coming
to
the
point
then
surely
it
must
be
worth
our
while
to
bear
discomfort
in
order
to
grow
of
some
good
jarvis
has
truly
said
that
if
jesus
had
had
such
a
father
he
would
have
made
him
of
some
good
before
he
made
him
comfortable
that
is
just
the
way
your
father
in
heaven
is
acting
with
you
not
many
of
you
would
say
you
are
of
much
good
yet
but
you
would
like
to
be
better
and
yet
put
it
to
yourselves
do
you
not
grumble
at
every
thing
that
comes
to
you
that
you
do
like
and
call
it
bad
luck
and
worse
yes
even
when
you
know
it
comes
of
your
own
fault
and
nobody
else
you
think
if
you
had
only
this
or
that
to
make
you
comfortable
you
would
be
content
and
you
call
it
very
hard
that
should
be
getting
on
well
and
saving
money
and
you
down
on
your
luck
as
you
say
some
of
you
even
grumble
that
your
neighbors
children
should
be
healthy
when
yours
are
pining
you
would
allow
that
you
are
not
of
much
good
yet
but
you
forget
that
to
make
you
comfortable
as
you
are
would
be
the
same
as
to
pull
out
joseph
misfitted
thrones
and
doors
and
make
his
misshapen
buckets
over
again
for
him
that
you
think
so
absurd
that
you
ca
believe
the
story
a
bit
but
you
would
be
helped
out
of
all
troubles
even
those
you
bring
on
yourselves
not
thinking
what
the
certain
consequence
would
be
namely
that
you
would
grow
of
less
and
less
value
until
you
were
of
no
good
either
to
god
or
man
if
you
think
about
it
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
when
for
instance
are
you
most
willing
to
do
right
when
are
you
most
ready
to
hear
about
good
things
when
are
you
most
inclined
to
pray
to
god
when
you
have
plenty
of
money
in
your
pockets
or
when
you
are
in
want
when
you
have
had
a
good
dinner
or
when
you
have
not
enough
to
get
one
when
you
are
in
jolly
health
or
when
the
life
seems
ebbing
out
of
you
in
misery
and
pain
no
matter
that
you
may
have
brought
it
on
yourselves
it
is
no
less
god
way
of
bringing
you
back
to
him
for
he
decrees
that
suffering
shall
follow
sin
it
is
just
then
you
most
need
it
and
if
it
drives
you
to
god
that
is
its
end
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
the
prodigal
was
himself
to
blame
for
the
want
that
made
him
a
beggar
at
the
swine
trough
yet
that
want
was
the
greatest
blessing
god
could
give
to
him
for
it
drove
him
home
to
his
father
but
some
of
you
will
say
you
are
no
prodigals
nor
is
it
your
fault
that
you
find
yourselves
in
such
difficulties
that
life
seems
hard
to
you
it
would
be
very
wrong
in
me
to
set
myself
up
as
your
judge
and
to
tell
you
that
it
your
fault
if
it
is
god
will
let
you
know
it
but
if
it
be
not
your
fault
it
does
not
follow
that
you
need
the
less
to
be
driven
back
to
god
it
is
not
only
in
punishment
of
our
sins
that
we
are
made
to
suffer
god
runaway
children
must
be
brought
back
to
their
home
and
their
blessedness
back
to
their
father
in
heaven
it
is
not
always
a
sign
that
god
is
displeased
with
us
when
he
makes
us
suffer
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
and
scourgeth
every
son
whom
he
receiveth
if
ye
endure
chastening
god
dealeth
with
you
as
with
sons
but
instead
of
talking
more
about
it
i
must
take
it
to
myself
and
learn
not
to
grumble
when
plans
fail
that
what
never
goes
and
does
grannie
growled
a
voice
from
somewhere
i
learned
afterwards
it
was
that
of
a
young
tailor
who
was
constantly
quarrelling
with
his
mother
i
think
i
have
given
up
grumbling
at
my
circumstances
she
rejoined
but
then
i
have
nothing
to
grumble
at
in
them
i
have
known
hunger
or
cold
for
a
great
many
years
now
but
i
do
feel
discontented
at
times
when
i
see
some
of
you
not
getting
better
so
fast
as
i
should
like
i
ought
to
have
patience
remembering
how
patient
god
is
with
my
conceit
and
stupidity
and
not
expect
too
much
of
you
still
it
ca
be
wrong
to
wish
that
you
tried
a
good
deal
more
to
do
what
he
wants
of
you
why
should
his
children
not
be
his
friends
if
you
would
but
give
yourselves
up
to
him
you
would
find
his
yoke
so
easy
his
burden
so
light
but
you
do
it
half
only
and
some
of
you
not
at
all
now
however
that
we
have
got
a
lesson
from
a
false
gospel
we
may
as
well
get
one
from
the
true
as
she
spoke
she
turned
to
her
new
testament
which
lay
beside
her
but
jarvis
interrupted
her
where
did
you
get
that
stuff
you
was
a
readin
of
to
us
grannie
he
asked
the
chapter
i
read
to
you
she
answered
is
part
of
a
pretended
gospel
called
first
gospel
of
the
infancy
of
jesus
christ
i
ca
tell
you
who
wrote
it
or
how
it
came
to
be
written
all
i
can
say
is
that
very
early
in
the
history
of
the
church
there
were
people
who
indulged
themselves
in
inventing
things
about
jesus
and
seemed
to
have
had
no
idea
of
the
importance
of
keeping
to
facts
or
in
other
words
of
speaking
and
writing
only
the
truth
all
they
seemed
to
have
cared
about
was
the
gratifying
of
their
own
feelings
of
love
and
veneration
and
so
they
made
up
tales
about
him
in
his
honor
as
they
supposed
no
doubt
just
as
if
he
had
been
a
false
god
of
the
greeks
or
romans
it
is
long
before
some
people
learn
to
speak
the
truth
even
after
they
know
it
is
wicked
to
lie
perhaps
however
they
did
not
expect
their
stories
to
be
received
as
facts
intending
them
only
as
a
sort
of
recognized
fiction
about
him
amazing
presumption
at
the
best
did
anybody
then
ever
believe
the
likes
of
that
grannie
asked
jarvis
yes
what
i
read
to
you
seems
to
have
been
believed
within
a
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
the
apostles
there
are
several
such
writings
with
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
in
them
which
were
generally
accepted
by
christian
people
for
many
hundreds
of
years
i
ca
imagine
how
anybody
could
go
inwentuating
such
things
said
the
blind
man
it
is
hard
for
us
to
imagine
they
could
not
have
seen
how
their
inventions
would
in
later
times
be
judged
any
thing
but
honoring
to
him
in
whose
honor
they
wrote
them
nothing
be
it
ever
so
well
invented
can
be
so
good
as
the
bare
truth
perhaps
however
no
one
in
particular
invented
some
of
them
but
the
stories
grew
just
as
a
report
often
does
amongst
yourselves
although
everybody
fancies
he
or
she
is
only
telling
just
what
was
told
to
him
or
her
yet
by
degrees
the
of
a
fact
is
covered
over
with
lies
upon
lies
almost
everybody
adding
something
until
the
report
has
grown
to
be
a
mighty
falsehood
why
you
had
such
a
story
yourselves
not
so
very
long
ago
about
one
of
your
best
friends
one
comfort
is
such
a
story
is
sure
not
to
be
consistent
with
itself
it
is
sure
to
show
its
own
falsehood
to
any
one
who
is
good
enough
to
doubt
it
and
who
will
look
into
it
and
examine
it
well
you
do
for
instance
want
any
other
proof
than
the
things
themselves
to
show
you
that
what
i
have
just
read
to
you
ca
be
true
but
then
it
puzzles
me
to
think
how
anybody
could
believe
them
said
the
blind
man
many
of
the
early
christians
were
so
childishly
simple
that
they
would
believe
almost
any
thing
that
was
told
them
in
a
time
when
such
nonsense
could
be
written
it
is
no
great
wonder
there
should
be
many
who
could
believe
it
then
what
was
their
faith
worth
said
the
blind
man
if
they
believed
false
and
true
all
the
same
worth
no
end
to
them
answered
marion
with
eagerness
for
all
the
false
things
they
might
believe
about
him
could
not
destroy
the
true
ones
or
prevent
them
from
believing
in
jesus
himself
and
bettering
their
ways
for
his
sake
and
as
they
grew
better
and
better
by
doing
what
he
told
them
they
would
gradually
come
to
disbelieve
this
and
that
foolish
or
bad
thing
but
would
that
make
them
stop
believing
in
him
altogether
on
the
contrary
it
would
make
them
hold
the
firmer
to
all
that
they
saw
to
be
true
about
him
there
are
many
people
i
presume
in
other
countries
who
believe
those
stories
still
but
all
the
christians
i
know
have
cast
aside
every
one
of
those
writings
and
keep
only
to
those
we
call
the
gospels
to
throw
away
what
is
not
true
because
it
is
not
true
will
always
help
the
heart
to
be
truer
will
make
it
the
more
anxious
to
cleave
to
what
it
sees
must
be
true
jesus
remonstrated
with
the
jews
that
they
would
not
of
themselves
judge
what
was
right
and
the
man
who
lets
god
teach
him
is
made
abler
to
judge
what
is
right
a
then
do
you
think
it
likely
this
much
is
true
grannie
said
jarvis
probably
interested
in
the
question
in
part
at
least
from
the
fact
that
he
was
himself
a
carpenter
that
he
worked
with
his
father
and
helped
him
in
his
trade
i
do
indeed
answered
marion
i
believe
that
is
the
one
germ
of
truth
in
the
whole
story
it
is
possible
even
that
some
incidents
of
that
part
of
his
life
may
have
been
handed
down
a
little
way
at
length
losing
all
their
shape
however
and
turning
into
the
kind
of
thing
i
read
to
you
not
to
mention
that
they
called
him
the
carpenter
is
it
likely
he
who
came
down
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
a
true
man
would
see
his
father
toiling
to
feed
him
and
his
mother
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
and
go
idling
about
instead
of
putting
to
his
hand
to
help
him
would
that
have
been
like
him
certainly
not
said
jarvis
but
a
doubtful
murmur
came
from
the
blind
man
which
speedily
took
shape
in
the
following
remark
i
ca
help
thinkin
grannie
of
one
time
you
read
it
to
us
not
long
ago
when
he
laid
down
in
the
boat
and
went
fast
asleep
takin
no
more
heed
o
them
a
slavin
o
theirselves
to
death
at
their
oars
than
if
they
been
all
comfortable
like
hisself
that
was
much
like
takin
of
his
share
was
it
now
john
evans
returned
marion
with
severity
it
is
quite
right
to
put
any
number
of
questions
and
express
any
number
of
doubts
you
honestly
feel
but
you
have
no
right
to
make
remarks
you
would
not
make
if
you
were
anxious
to
be
as
fair
to
another
as
you
would
have
another
be
to
you
have
you
considered
that
he
had
been
working
hard
all
day
long
and
was
in
fact
worn
out
you
do
think
what
hard
work
it
is
and
how
exhausting
to
speak
for
hours
to
great
multitudes
and
in
the
open
air
too
where
your
voice
has
no
help
to
make
it
heard
and
that
not
all
for
he
had
most
likely
been
healing
many
as
well
and
i
believe
every
time
the
power
went
out
of
him
to
cure
he
suffered
in
the
relief
he
gave
it
left
him
weakened
with
so
much
the
less
of
strength
to
support
his
labors
so
that
even
in
his
very
body
he
took
our
iniquities
and
bare
our
infirmities
would
you
then
blame
a
weary
man
whose
perfect
faith
in
god
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
fear
any
thing
that
he
lay
down
to
rest
in
god
name
and
left
his
friends
to
do
their
part
for
the
redemption
of
the
world
in
rowing
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
lake
a
thing
they
were
doing
every
other
day
of
their
lives
you
ought
to
consider
before
you
make
such
remarks
evans
and
you
forget
also
that
the
moment
they
called
him
he
rose
to
help
them
and
find
fault
with
them
interposed
evans
rather
viciously
i
thought
yes
for
they
were
to
blame
for
their
own
trouble
and
ought
to
send
it
away
what
to
blame
for
the
storm
how
could
they
send
that
away
was
it
the
storm
that
troubled
them
then
it
was
their
own
fear
of
it
the
storm
could
not
have
troubled
them
if
they
had
had
faith
in
their
father
in
heaven
they
had
good
cause
to
be
afraid
of
it
anyhow
he
judged
they
had
not
for
he
was
not
afraid
himself
you
judge
they
had
because
you
would
have
been
afraid
he
could
help
himself
you
see
and
they
could
trust
either
him
or
his
father
notwithstanding
all
he
had
done
to
manifest
himself
and
his
father
to
them
therefore
he
saw
that
the
storm
about
them
was
not
the
thing
that
most
required
rebuke
i
never
pretended
to
much
o
the
sort
growled
evans
quite
the
contrairy
and
why
because
like
an
honest
man
you
would
pretend
to
what
you
had
got
but
if
you
carried
your
honesty
far
enough
you
would
have
taken
pains
to
understand
our
lord
first
like
his
other
judges
you
condemn
him
beforehand
you
will
not
call
that
honesty
i
do
see
what
right
you
got
to
badger
me
like
this
before
a
congregation
o
people
said
the
blind
man
rising
in
indignation
if
i
ai
got
my
heyesight
i
ha
got
my
feelin
and
do
you
think
has
no
feelings
evans
you
have
spoken
evil
of
i
have
spoken
but
the
truth
of
come
come
grannie
said
the
blind
man
quailing
a
little
do
talk
squash
i
a
livin
man
afore
the
heyes
o
this
here
company
an
he
nowheres
bless
you
do
mind
he
minds
so
much
returned
marion
in
a
subdued
voice
which
seemed
to
tremble
with
coming
tears
that
he
will
never
rest
until
you
think
fairly
of
him
and
he
is
here
now
for
he
said
am
with
you
alway
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
he
has
heard
every
word
you
have
been
saying
against
him
he
is
angry
like
me
but
your
words
may
well
make
him
feel
sad
for
your
sake
john
evans
that
you
should
be
so
unfair
she
leaned
her
forehead
on
her
hand
and
was
silent
a
subdued
murmur
arose
the
blind
man
having
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment
began
to
make
for
the
door
saying
i
think
i
better
go
i
ai
wanted
here
if
you
an
honest
man
evans
returned
marion
rising
you
will
sit
down
and
hear
the
case
out
with
a
waving
motion
of
both
his
hands
evans
sank
into
his
seat
and
spoke
no
word
after
but
a
moment
silence
she
resumed
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
that
he
should
sleep
then
during
the
storm
was
a
very
different
thing
from
declining
to
assist
his
father
in
his
workshop
just
as
the
rebuking
of
the
sea
was
a
very
different
thing
from
hiding
up
his
father
bad
work
in
miracles
had
that
father
been
in
danger
he
might
perhaps
have
aided
him
as
he
did
the
disciples
but
why
do
you
say
grannie
interrupted
a
boy
who
sat
on
the
hob
of
the
empty
grate
would
he
help
his
father
as
soon
as
his
disciples
certainly
if
it
was
good
for
his
father
certainly
not
if
it
was
not
good
for
him
therefore
i
say
but
now
she
went
on
turning
to
the
joiner
jarvis
will
you
tell
me
whether
you
think
the
work
of
the
carpenter
son
would
have
been
in
any
way
distinguishable
from
that
of
another
man
well
i
do
know
grannie
he
would
want
to
be
putting
of
a
private
mark
upon
it
he
would
want
to
be
showing
of
it
off
would
he
he
use
his
tools
like
another
man
anyhow
all
that
we
may
be
certain
of
he
came
to
us
a
man
to
live
a
man
life
and
do
a
man
work
but
just
think
a
moment
i
will
put
the
question
again
do
you
suppose
you
would
have
been
able
to
distinguish
his
work
from
that
of
any
other
man
a
silence
followed
jarvis
was
thinking
he
and
the
blind
man
were
of
the
few
that
can
think
at
last
his
face
brightened
well
grannie
he
said
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
in
any
thing
easy
but
very
easy
in
any
thing
difficult
he
laughed
for
he
had
not
perceived
the
paradox
before
uttering
it
explain
yourself
if
you
please
jarvis
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
said
marion
i
mean
that
in
an
easy
job
which
any
fair
workman
could
do
well
enough
it
would
not
be
easy
to
tell
his
work
but
where
the
job
was
difficult
it
would
be
so
much
better
done
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
see
the
better
hand
in
it
i
understand
you
then
to
indicate
that
the
chief
distinction
would
lie
in
the
quality
of
the
work
that
whatever
he
did
he
would
do
in
such
a
thorough
manner
that
over
the
whole
of
what
he
turned
out
as
you
would
say
the
perfection
of
the
work
would
be
a
striking
characteristic
is
that
it
that
is
what
i
do
mean
grannie
and
that
is
just
the
conclusion
i
had
come
to
myself
should
like
to
say
just
one
word
to
it
grannie
so
be
you
wo
cut
up
crusty
said
the
blind
man
if
you
are
fair
i
be
crusty
evans
at
least
i
hope
not
said
marion
well
it
this
jarvis
he
say
as
how
the
done
by
jesus
christ
would
be
better
done
than
another
man
fashion
and
there
would
lie
the
differ
now
it
do
seem
to
me
as
i
got
no
call
to
come
to
that
conclusion
you
been
tellin
on
us
grannie
i
donno
how
long
now
as
how
jesus
christ
was
the
son
of
god
and
that
he
come
to
do
the
works
of
god
down
here
like
afore
our
faces
that
we
might
see
god
at
work
by
way
of
now
i
ha
nothin
to
say
agin
that
it
may
be
or
it
may
be
i
ca
tell
but
if
that
be
the
way
on
it
then
i
do
see
how
jarvis
can
be
right
the
two
do
curryspond
not
by
no
means
for
the
works
o
god
there
ai
one
as
i
can
see
downright
well
managed
jiner
work
as
i
may
say
leastways
now
stop
a
bit
grannie
do
trip
a
man
up
and
then
say
as
he
fell
over
his
own
dog
leastways
i
do
say
about
the
moon
an
the
stars
an
that
i
dessay
the
sun
he
do
get
up
the
werry
moment
he
called
of
a
mornin
an
the
moon
when
she
ought
to
for
her
i
ai
no
strawnry
and
i
ai
heerd
no
complaints
about
but
i
do
say
as
how
down
here
we
ha
got
most
uncommon
bad
weather
at
times
and
the
walnuts
they
turns
out
every
now
an
then
full
o
mere
dirt
an
the
oranges
awful
there
been
a
good
crop
o
hay
they
tells
me
for
many
the
year
an
i
furren
parts
what
wi
earthquakes
an
wolcanies
an
lions
an
tigers
an
savages
as
eats
their
wisiters
an
blowin
about
an
ships
goin
down
an
fathers
o
families
choked
drownded
an
burnt
i
by
the
hundred
it
do
seem
to
me
that
if
his
jinerin
had
been
it
would
ha
been
but
like
the
rest
on
it
there
grannie
mind
i
mean
no
offence
an
i
do
doubt
you
ha
got
somethink
i
your
weskit
pocket
as
turn
it
all
in
a
moment
anyhow
i
wo
purtend
to
nothink
and
that
how
it
look
to
me
i
admit
said
marion
that
the
objection
is
a
reasonable
one
but
why
do
you
put
it
evans
in
such
a
triumphant
way
as
if
you
were
rejoiced
to
think
it
admitted
of
no
answer
and
believed
the
world
would
be
ever
so
much
better
off
if
the
storms
and
the
tigers
had
it
all
their
own
way
and
there
were
no
god
to
look
after
things
now
you
ai
fair
to
grannie
not
avin
of
my
heyesight
like
the
rest
on
ye
i
may
be
a
bit
fond
of
a
harguyment
but
i
tries
to
hit
fair
and
when
i
hears
what
ai
logic
i
can
no
more
help
comin
down
upon
it
than
i
can
help
breathin
the
air
o
heaven
and
why
should
i
there
ai
no
law
agin
a
harguyment
an
more
an
over
it
do
seem
to
me
as
how
you
and
jarvis
is
wrong
i
harguyment
if
i
was
too
sharp
upon
you
evans
and
i
may
have
been
said
marion
i
beg
your
pardon
it
granted
grannie
i
do
mean
you
know
that
i
give
in
to
what
you
say
not
one
bit
i
did
expect
it
of
you
i
here
for
you
to
knock
me
down
i
do
think
a
mere
victory
is
worth
the
breath
spent
upon
it
said
marion
but
we
should
all
be
glad
to
get
or
give
more
light
upon
any
subject
if
it
be
by
losing
ever
so
many
arguments
allow
me
just
to
put
a
question
or
two
to
jarvis
because
he
a
joiner
himself
and
that
a
great
comfort
to
me
what
would
you
say
jarvis
of
a
master
who
planed
the
timber
he
used
for
scaffolding
and
tied
the
crosspieces
with
ropes
of
silk
i
should
say
he
was
a
fool
grannie
not
only
for
losin
of
his
money
and
his
labor
but
for
weakenin
of
his
scaffoldin
summat
like
the
old
i
that
chapter
i
should
say
what
the
object
of
a
scaffold
mr
jarvis
to
get
at
something
else
by
means
of
say
build
a
house
then
so
long
as
the
house
was
going
up
all
right
the
probability
is
there
would
be
much
amiss
with
the
scaffold
certainly
provided
it
stood
till
it
was
taken
down
and
now
evans
she
said
next
turning
to
the
blind
man
i
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
putting
a
question
or
two
to
you
all
right
grannie
fire
away
will
you
tell
me
then
what
the
object
of
this
world
is
well
most
people
makes
it
their
object
to
get
money
and
make
theirselves
comfortable
but
you
do
think
that
is
what
the
world
was
made
for
oh
as
to
that
how
should
i
know
grannie
and
not
knowin
i
wo
say
if
you
saw
a
scaffold
said
marion
turning
again
to
jarvis
would
you
be
in
danger
of
mistaking
it
for
a
permanent
erection
nobody
would
be
such
a
fool
he
answered
the
look
of
it
would
tell
you
that
you
would
complain
then
if
it
should
be
a
little
out
of
the
square
and
if
there
should
be
no
windows
in
it
jarvis
only
laughed
evans
marion
went
on
turning
again
to
the
blind
man
do
you
think
the
design
of
this
world
was
to
make
men
comfortable
if
it
was
it
do
seem
to
ha
succeeded
answered
evans
and
you
complain
of
that
do
you
well
yes
rather
said
the
blind
man
adding
no
doubt
as
he
recalled
the
former
part
of
the
evening
talk
for
harguyment
ye
know
grannie
you
think
perhaps
that
god
having
gone
so
far
to
make
this
world
a
pleasant
and
comfortable
place
to
live
in
might
have
gone
farther
and
made
it
quite
pleasant
and
comfortable
for
everybody
whoever
could
make
it
at
all
could
ha
done
that
grannie
then
as
he
has
done
it
the
probability
is
he
did
mean
to
do
it
of
course
that
what
i
complain
of
then
he
meant
to
do
something
else
it
looks
like
it
the
whole
affair
has
an
unfinished
look
you
think
i
just
do
what
if
it
were
not
meant
to
stand
then
what
if
it
were
meant
only
for
a
temporary
assistance
in
carrying
out
something
finished
and
lasting
and
of
unspeakably
more
importance
suppose
god
were
building
a
palace
for
you
and
had
set
up
a
scaffold
upon
which
he
wanted
you
to
help
him
would
it
be
reasonable
in
you
to
complain
that
you
did
find
the
scaffold
at
all
a
comfortable
place
to
live
in
that
it
was
draughty
and
cold
this
world
is
that
scaffold
and
if
you
were
busy
carrying
stones
and
mortar
for
the
palace
you
would
be
glad
of
all
the
cold
to
cool
the
glow
of
your
labor
i
sure
i
work
hard
enough
when
i
get
a
job
as
my
heyesight
will
enable
me
to
do
said
evans
missing
the
spirit
of
her
figure
yes
i
believe
you
do
but
what
will
all
the
labor
of
a
workman
who
does
not
fall
in
with
the
design
of
the
builder
come
to
you
may
say
you
understand
the
design
will
you
say
also
that
you
are
under
no
obligation
to
put
so
much
faith
in
the
builder
who
is
said
to
be
your
god
and
father
as
to
do
the
thing
he
tells
you
instead
of
working
away
at
the
palace
like
men
will
you
go
on
tacking
bits
of
matting
and
old
carpet
about
the
corners
of
the
scaffold
to
keep
the
wind
off
while
that
same
wind
keeps
tearing
them
away
and
scattering
them
you
keep
trying
to
live
in
a
scaffold
which
not
all
you
could
do
to
all
eternity
would
make
a
house
of
you
see
what
i
mean
mr
evans
well
not
ezackly
replied
the
blind
man
i
mean
that
god
wants
to
build
you
a
house
whereof
the
walls
shall
be
you
want
a
house
whereof
the
walls
shall
be
but
god
knows
that
such
walls
can
not
be
built
that
that
kind
of
stone
crumbles
away
in
the
foolish
workman
hands
he
would
make
you
comfortable
but
neither
is
that
his
first
object
nor
can
it
be
gained
without
the
first
which
is
to
make
you
good
he
loves
you
so
much
that
he
would
infinitely
rather
have
you
good
and
uncomfortable
for
then
he
could
take
you
to
his
heart
as
his
own
children
than
comfortable
and
not
good
for
then
he
could
not
come
near
you
or
give
you
any
thing
he
counted
worth
having
for
himself
or
worth
giving
to
you
so
said
jarvis
you
just
brought
us
round
grannie
to
the
same
thing
as
before
i
believe
so
returned
marion
it
comes
to
this
that
when
god
would
build
a
palace
for
himself
to
dwell
in
with
his
children
he
does
not
want
his
scaffold
so
constructed
that
they
shall
be
able
to
make
a
house
of
it
for
themselves
and
live
like
apes
instead
of
angels
but
if
god
can
do
any
thing
he
please
said
evans
he
might
as
well
us
good
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
that
is
just
what
he
is
doing
returned
marion
perhaps
by
giving
them
perfect
health
and
every
thing
they
wanted
with
absolute
good
temper
and
making
them
very
fond
of
each
other
besides
god
might
have
provided
himself
a
people
he
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
governing
and
amongst
whom
in
consequence
there
would
have
been
no
crime
and
no
struggle
or
suffering
but
i
have
known
a
dog
with
more
goodness
than
that
would
come
to
we
can
not
be
good
without
having
consented
to
be
made
good
god
shows
us
the
good
and
the
bad
urges
us
to
be
good
wakes
good
thoughts
and
desires
in
us
helps
our
spirit
with
his
spirit
our
thought
with
his
thought
but
we
must
yield
we
must
turn
to
him
we
must
consent
yes
try
to
be
made
good
if
we
could
grow
good
without
trying
it
would
be
a
poor
goodness
should
not
be
good
after
all
at
best
we
should
only
be
not
bad
god
wants
us
to
choose
to
be
good
and
so
be
partakers
of
his
holiness
he
would
have
us
lay
hold
of
him
he
who
has
given
his
son
to
suffer
for
us
will
make
us
suffer
too
bitterly
if
needful
that
we
may
bethink
ourselves
and
turn
to
him
he
would
make
us
as
good
as
good
can
be
that
is
perfectly
good
and
therefore
will
rouse
us
to
take
the
needful
hand
in
the
work
ourselves
rouse
us
by
discomforts
innumerable
you
see
then
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
apparent
imperfections
of
the
creation
around
us
that
jesus
should
have
done
the
best
possible
carpenter
work
for
those
very
imperfections
are
actually
through
their
imperfection
the
means
of
carrying
out
the
higher
creation
god
has
in
view
and
at
which
he
is
working
all
the
time
now
let
me
read
you
what
king
david
thought
upon
this
question
she
read
the
hundred
and
seventh
psalm
then
they
had
some
singing
in
which
the
children
took
a
delightful
part
i
have
seldom
heard
children
sing
pleasantly
in
sunday
schools
i
have
always
found
their
voices
painfully
harsh
but
marion
made
her
children
restrain
their
voices
and
sing
softly
which
had
she
said
an
excellent
moral
effect
on
themselves
all
squalling
and
screeching
whether
in
art
or
morals
being
ruinous
to
either
toward
the
close
of
the
singing
roger
and
i
slipped
out
we
had
all
but
tacitly
agreed
it
would
be
best
to
make
no
apology
but
just
vanish
and
come
again
with
percivale
the
following
sunday
the
greater
part
of
the
way
home
we
walked
in
silence
what
did
you
think
of
that
roger
i
asked
at
length
quite
socratic
as
to
method
he
answered
and
said
no
more
i
sent
a
full
report
of
the
evening
to
my
father
who
was
delighted
with
it
although
of
course
much
was
lost
in
the
reporting
of
the
mere
words
not
to
mention
the
absence
of
her
sweet
face
and
shining
eyes
of
her
quiet
earnest
musical
voice
my
father
kept
the
letter
and
that
is
how
i
am
able
to
give
the
present
report
chapter
xxx
about
servants
i
went
to
call
on
lady
bernard
the
next
day
for
there
was
one
subject
on
which
i
could
better
talk
with
her
than
with
marion
and
that
subject
was
marion
herself
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
i
said
that
i
had
had
more
than
usual
need
of
such
a
lesson
as
she
gave
us
the
night
before
i
had
been
and
indeed
still
was
so
vexed
with
my
nurse
what
is
the
matter
asked
lady
bernard
she
has
given
me
warning
i
answered
she
has
been
with
you
some
time
has
she
not
ever
since
we
were
married
what
reason
does
she
give
oh
she
wants
better
of
course
i
replied
in
such
a
tone
that
lady
bernard
rejoined
and
why
should
she
not
better
herself
but
she
has
such
a
false
notion
of
bettering
herself
i
am
confident
what
she
wants
will
do
any
thing
but
better
her
if
she
gets
it
what
is
her
notion
then
are
you
sure
you
have
got
at
the
real
one
i
believe
i
have
when
i
asked
her
first
she
said
she
was
very
comfortable
and
condescended
to
inform
me
that
she
had
nothing
against
either
me
or
her
master
but
thought
it
was
time
she
was
having
more
wages
for
a
friend
of
hers
who
had
left
home
a
year
after
herself
was
having
two
more
pounds
than
she
had
it
is
very
natural
and
certainly
not
wrong
that
she
should
wish
for
more
wages
i
told
her
she
need
not
have
taken
such
a
way
of
asking
for
an
advance
and
said
i
would
raise
her
wages
with
pleasure
but
instead
of
receiving
the
announcement
with
any
sign
of
satisfaction
she
seemed
put
out
by
it
and
after
some
considerable
amount
of
incoherence
blurted
out
that
the
place
was
dull
and
she
wanted
a
change
at
length
however
i
got
at
her
real
reason
which
was
simply
ambition
she
wanted
to
rise
in
the
world
to
get
a
place
where
were
kept
a
more
fashionable
place
in
fact
a
very
mistaken
ambition
certainly
said
lady
bernard
but
one
which
would
be
counted
natural
enough
in
any
other
line
of
life
had
she
given
you
ground
for
imagining
higher
aims
in
her
she
had
been
so
long
with
us
that
i
thought
she
must
have
some
regard
for
us
she
has
probably
a
good
deal
more
than
she
is
aware
of
but
change
is
as
needful
to
some
minds
for
their
education
as
an
even
tenor
of
life
is
to
others
probably
she
has
got
all
the
good
she
is
capable
of
receiving
from
you
and
there
may
be
some
one
ready
to
take
her
place
for
whom
you
will
be
able
to
do
more
however
inconvenient
it
may
be
for
you
to
change
the
more
young
people
pass
through
your
house
the
better
if
it
were
really
for
her
good
i
hope
i
should
mind
you
can
not
tell
what
may
be
needful
to
cause
the
seed
you
have
sown
to
germinate
it
may
be
necessary
for
her
to
pass
to
another
class
in
the
school
of
life
before
she
can
realize
what
she
learned
in
yours
i
was
silent
for
i
was
beginning
to
feel
ashamed
and
lady
bernard
went
on
when
i
hear
mistresses
lamenting
over
some
favorite
servant
as
marrying
certain
misery
in
exchange
for
a
comfortable
home
with
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
i
always
think
of
the
other
side
to
it
namely
how
through
the
instincts
of
his
own
implanting
god
is
urging
her
to
a
path
in
which
by
passing
through
the
fires
and
waters
of
suffering
she
may
be
stung
to
the
life
of
a
true
humanity
and
such
suffering
is
far
more
ready
to
work
its
perfect
work
on
a
girl
who
has
passed
through
a
family
like
yours
i
would
say
a
word
to
keep
her
if
she
were
going
to
be
married
i
said
but
you
will
allow
there
is
good
reason
to
fear
she
will
be
no
better
for
such
a
change
as
she
desires
you
have
good
reason
to
fear
my
child
said
lady
bernard
smiling
so
as
to
take
all
sting
out
of
the
reproof
that
you
have
too
little
faith
in
the
god
who
cares
for
your
maid
as
for
you
it
is
not
indeed
likely
that
she
will
have
such
help
as
yours
where
she
goes
next
but
the
loss
of
it
may
throw
her
back
on
herself
and
bring
out
her
individuality
which
is
her
conscience
still
i
am
far
from
wondering
at
your
fear
for
her
knowing
well
what
dangers
she
may
fall
into
shall
i
tell
you
what
first
began
to
open
my
eyes
to
the
evils
of
a
large
establishment
wishing
to
get
rid
of
part
of
the
weight
of
my
affairs
and
at
the
same
time
to
assist
a
relative
who
was
in
want
of
employment
i
committed
to
him
along
with
larger
matters
the
oversight
of
my
household
expenses
and
found
that
he
saved
me
the
whole
of
his
salary
this
will
be
easily
understood
from
a
single
fact
soon
after
his
appointment
he
called
on
a
tradesman
to
pay
him
his
bill
the
man
taking
him
for
a
new
butler
offered
him
the
same
discount
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
giving
his
supposed
predecessor
namely
per
cent
a
discount
i
need
not
say
never
intended
to
reach
my
knowledge
any
more
than
my
purse
the
fact
was
patent
i
had
been
living
in
a
hotel
of
which
i
not
only
paid
the
rent
but
paid
the
landlord
for
cheating
me
with
such
a
head
to
an
establishment
you
may
judge
what
the
members
may
become
i
remember
an
amusing
experience
my
roger
percivale
once
had
of
your
household
i
said
i
also
remember
it
perfectly
she
returned
that
was
how
i
came
to
know
him
but
i
knew
something
of
his
family
long
before
i
remember
his
grandfather
a
great
buyer
of
pictures
and
marbles
lady
bernard
here
gave
me
the
story
from
her
point
of
view
but
narrative
being
of
necessity
the
more
complete
i
tell
the
tale
as
he
told
it
me
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
he
was
assisting
the
sculptor
and
had
taken
a
share
in
both
the
modelling
and
the
carving
of
a
bust
of
lady
bernard
father
when
it
was
finished
and
was
about
to
take
it
home
he
asked
roger
to
accompany
him
and
help
him
to
get
it
safe
into
the
house
and
properly
placed
roger
and
the
butler
between
them
carried
it
to
the
where
were
lady
bernard
and
a
company
of
her
friends
whom
she
had
invited
to
meet
f
at
lunch
and
see
the
bust
there
being
no
pedestal
yet
ready
made
choice
of
a
certain
small
table
for
it
to
stand
upon
and
then
accompanied
her
ladyship
and
her
other
guests
to
the
leaving
roger
to
uncover
the
bust
place
it
in
the
proper
light
and
do
whatever
more
might
be
necessary
to
its
proper
effect
on
the
company
when
they
should
return
as
she
left
the
room
lady
bernard
told
roger
to
ring
for
a
servant
to
clear
the
table
for
him
and
render
what
other
assistance
he
might
want
he
did
so
a
lackey
answered
the
bell
and
roger
requested
him
to
remove
the
things
from
the
table
the
man
left
the
room
and
did
not
return
roger
therefore
cleared
and
moved
the
table
himself
and
with
difficulty
got
the
bust
upon
it
finding
then
several
stains
upon
the
pure
half
transparency
of
the
marble
he
rang
the
bell
for
a
basin
of
water
and
a
sponge
another
man
appeared
looked
into
the
room
and
went
away
he
rang
once
more
and
yet
another
servant
came
this
last
condescended
to
hear
him
and
informing
him
that
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
in
the
scullery
vanished
in
his
turn
by
this
time
roger
confesses
to
have
been
rather
in
a
rage
but
what
could
he
do
least
of
all
allow
work
and
the
likeness
of
her
ladyship
father
to
make
its
debut
with
a
spot
on
its
nose
therefore
seeing
he
could
not
otherwise
procure
what
was
necessary
he
set
out
in
quest
of
the
unknown
appurtenances
of
the
kitchen
it
is
unpleasant
to
find
one
self
astray
even
in
a
moderately
sized
house
and
roger
did
not
at
all
relish
wandering
about
the
huge
place
with
no
to
keep
him
in
its
not
to
speak
of
directing
him
to
the
remotest
recesses
of
a
house
full
as
chaucer
says
of
crenkles
at
last
however
he
found
himself
at
the
door
of
the
servants
hall
two
men
were
lying
on
their
backs
on
benches
with
their
knees
above
their
heads
in
the
air
a
third
was
engaged
in
emptying
a
pewter
pot
between
his
draughts
tossing
across
its
mouth
to
a
damsel
who
was
removing
the
remains
of
some
private
luncheon
and
a
fourth
sat
in
one
of
the
windows
reading
bell
life
roger
took
it
all
in
at
a
glance
while
to
one
of
the
giants
supine
or
rather
to
a
perpendicular
pair
of
white
stockings
he
preferred
his
request
for
a
basin
and
a
sponge
once
more
he
was
informed
that
he
would
find
what
he
wanted
in
the
scullery
there
was
no
time
to
waste
on
unavailing
demands
therefore
he
only
begged
further
to
be
directed
how
to
find
it
the
fellow
without
raising
his
head
or
lowering
his
knees
jabbered
out
such
instructions
as
from
the
rapidity
with
which
he
delivered
them
were
if
not
unintelligible
at
all
events
incomprehensible
and
roger
had
to
set
out
again
on
the
quest
only
not
quite
so
bewildered
as
before
he
found
a
certain
long
passage
mentioned
however
and
happily
before
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
it
met
a
maid
who
with
the
utmost
civility
gave
him
full
instructions
to
find
the
place
the
was
equally
civil
and
roger
returned
with
basin
and
sponge
to
the
where
he
speedily
removed
the
too
troublesome
stains
from
the
face
of
the
marble
when
the
company
saw
at
once
from
the
expression
and
bearing
of
roger
that
something
had
happened
to
discompose
him
and
asked
him
what
was
amiss
roger
having
briefly
informed
him
at
once
recounted
the
facts
to
lady
bernard
who
immediately
requested
a
full
statement
from
roger
himself
and
heard
the
whole
story
she
walked
straight
to
the
bell
and
ordered
up
every
one
of
her
domestics
from
the
butler
to
the
without
one
hasty
word
or
one
bodily
sign
of
the
anger
she
was
in
except
the
flashing
of
her
eyes
she
told
them
she
could
not
have
had
a
suspicion
that
such
insolence
was
possible
in
her
house
that
they
had
disgraced
her
in
her
own
eyes
as
having
gathered
such
people
about
her
that
she
would
not
add
to
percivale
annoyance
by
asking
him
to
point
out
the
guilty
persons
but
that
they
might
assure
themselves
she
would
henceforth
keep
both
eyes
and
ears
open
and
if
the
slightest
thing
of
the
sort
happened
again
she
would
most
assuredly
dismiss
every
one
of
them
at
a
warning
she
then
turned
to
roger
and
said
percivale
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
insults
you
have
received
from
my
servants
i
did
think
she
said
as
she
finished
telling
me
the
story
to
dismiss
them
all
on
the
spot
but
was
deterred
by
the
fear
of
injustice
the
next
morning
however
four
or
five
of
them
gave
my
housekeeper
warning
i
gave
orders
that
they
should
leave
the
house
at
once
and
from
that
day
i
set
about
reducing
my
establishment
my
principal
objects
were
two
first
that
my
servants
might
have
more
work
and
second
that
i
might
be
able
to
know
something
of
every
one
of
them
for
one
thing
i
saw
that
until
i
ruled
my
own
house
well
i
had
no
right
to
go
trying
to
do
good
out
of
doors
i
think
i
do
know
a
little
of
the
nature
and
character
of
every
soul
under
my
roof
now
and
i
am
more
and
more
confident
that
nothing
of
real
and
lasting
benefit
can
be
done
for
a
class
except
through
personal
influence
upon
the
individual
persons
who
compose
it
such
influence
i
mean
as
at
the
very
least
sets
for
christianity
chapter
xxxi
about
percivale
i
should
like
much
before
in
my
narrative
approaching
a
certain
hard
season
we
had
to
encounter
to
say
a
few
words
concerning
my
husband
if
i
only
knew
how
i
find
women
differ
much
both
in
the
degree
and
manner
in
which
their
feelings
will
permit
them
to
talk
about
their
husbands
i
have
known
women
set
a
whole
community
against
their
husbands
by
the
way
in
which
they
trumpeted
their
praises
and
i
have
known
one
woman
set
everybody
against
herself
by
the
way
in
which
she
published
her
faults
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
either
sort
to
praise
one
husband
is
so
like
praising
one
self
that
to
me
it
seems
immodest
and
subject
to
the
same
suspicion
as
while
to
blame
one
husband
even
justly
and
openly
seems
to
me
to
border
upon
treachery
itself
how
then
am
i
to
discharge
a
sort
of
half
duty
my
father
has
laid
upon
me
by
what
he
has
said
in
the
seaboard
parish
concerning
my
husband
opinions
my
father
is
one
of
the
few
really
men
i
have
yet
known
but
i
am
not
certain
that
he
has
done
percivale
justice
at
the
same
time
if
he
has
not
percivale
himself
is
partly
to
blame
inasmuch
as
he
never
took
pains
to
show
my
father
what
he
was
for
had
he
done
so
my
father
of
all
men
would
have
understood
him
on
the
other
hand
this
fault
if
such
it
was
could
have
sprung
only
from
my
husband
modesty
and
his
horror
of
possibly
producing
an
impression
on
my
father
mind
more
favorable
than
correct
it
is
all
right
now
however
still
my
difficulty
remains
as
to
how
i
am
to
write
about
him
i
must
encourage
myself
with
the
consideration
that
none
but
our
own
friends
with
whom
whether
they
understood
us
or
not
we
are
safe
will
know
to
whom
the
veiled
narrative
points
but
some
acute
reader
may
say
you
describe
your
husband
picture
he
will
be
known
by
that
in
this
matter
i
have
been
cunning
i
hope
not
deceitful
inasmuch
as
i
now
reveal
my
cunning
instead
of
describing
any
real
picture
of
his
i
have
always
substituted
one
he
has
only
talked
about
the
picture
actually
associated
with
the
facts
related
is
not
the
picture
i
have
described
although
my
husband
left
the
impression
on
my
father
mind
lasting
for
a
long
time
that
he
had
some
definite
repugnance
to
christianity
itself
i
had
been
soon
satisfied
perhaps
from
his
being
more
open
with
me
that
certain
unworthy
representations
of
christianity
coming
to
him
with
authority
had
cast
discredit
upon
the
whole
idea
of
it
in
the
first
year
or
two
of
our
married
life
we
had
many
talks
on
the
subject
and
i
was
astonished
to
find
what
things
he
imagined
to
be
acknowledged
essentials
of
christianity
which
have
no
place
whatever
in
the
new
testament
and
i
think
it
was
in
proportion
as
he
came
to
see
his
own
misconceptions
that
although
there
was
little
or
no
outward
difference
to
be
perceived
in
him
i
could
more
and
more
clearly
distinguish
an
of
thought
and
feeling
setting
towards
the
faith
which
christianity
preaches
he
said
little
or
nothing
even
when
i
attempted
to
draw
him
out
on
the
matter
for
he
was
almost
morbidly
careful
not
to
seem
to
know
any
thing
he
did
not
know
or
to
appear
what
he
was
not
the
most
i
could
get
out
of
him
was
but
i
had
better
give
a
little
talk
i
had
with
him
on
one
occasion
it
was
some
time
before
we
began
to
go
to
marion
on
a
sunday
evening
and
i
had
asked
him
to
go
with
me
to
a
certain
little
chapel
in
the
neighborhood
what
he
said
merrily
the
daughter
of
a
clergyman
be
seen
going
to
a
conventicle
if
i
did
it
i
would
be
seen
doing
it
i
answered
do
you
know
that
the
man
is
no
conciliatory
or
even
mild
dissenter
but
a
decided
enemy
to
church
and
state
and
all
that
pursued
percivale
i
do
care
i
returned
i
know
nothing
about
it
what
i
know
is
that
he
a
poet
and
a
prophet
both
in
one
he
stirs
up
my
heart
within
me
and
makes
me
long
to
be
good
he
is
no
orator
and
yet
breaks
into
bursts
of
eloquence
such
as
none
of
the
studied
orators
to
whom
you
profess
so
great
an
aversion
could
ever
reach
you
may
well
be
right
there
it
is
against
nature
for
a
speaker
to
be
eloquent
throughout
his
discourse
and
the
false
will
of
course
quench
the
true
i
do
mind
going
if
you
wish
it
i
suppose
he
believes
what
he
says
at
least
not
a
doubt
of
it
he
could
not
speak
as
he
does
from
less
than
a
thorough
belief
do
you
mean
to
say
wynnie
that
he
is
of
every
thing
i
want
to
urge
an
unreasonable
question
but
is
he
that
the
story
of
the
new
testament
is
in
the
main
actual
fact
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
trouble
your
faith
but
my
father
says
i
interrupted
that
a
true
faith
is
like
the
pool
of
bethesda
it
is
when
troubled
that
it
shows
its
healing
power
that
depends
on
where
the
trouble
comes
from
perhaps
said
percivale
anyhow
i
answered
it
is
only
that
which
can
not
be
shaken
that
shall
remain
well
i
will
tell
you
what
seems
to
me
a
very
difficulty
how
is
any
one
to
be
of
the
things
recorded
i
can
not
imagine
a
man
of
our
time
absolutely
certain
of
them
if
you
tell
me
i
have
testimony
i
answer
that
the
testimony
itself
requires
testimony
i
never
even
saw
the
people
who
bear
it
have
just
as
good
reason
to
doubt
their
existence
as
that
of
him
concerning
whom
they
bear
it
have
positively
no
means
of
verifying
it
and
indeed
have
so
little
confidence
in
all
that
is
called
evidence
knowing
how
it
can
be
twisted
that
i
should
distrust
any
conclusion
i
might
seem
about
to
come
to
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
it
does
appear
to
me
that
if
the
thing
were
of
god
he
would
have
taken
care
that
it
should
be
possible
for
an
honest
man
to
place
a
hearty
confidence
in
its
record
he
had
never
talked
to
me
so
openly
and
i
took
it
as
a
sign
that
he
had
been
thinking
more
of
these
things
than
hitherto
i
felt
it
a
serious
matter
to
have
to
answer
such
words
for
how
could
i
have
any
better
assurance
of
that
external
kind
than
percivale
himself
that
i
was
in
the
same
intellectual
position
however
enabled
me
the
better
to
understand
him
for
a
short
time
i
was
silent
while
he
regarded
me
with
a
look
of
concern
fearful
i
fancied
lest
he
should
have
involved
me
in
his
own
perplexity
is
it
possible
percivale
i
said
that
god
may
not
care
so
much
for
beginning
at
that
end
i
do
quite
understand
you
wynnie
he
returned
a
man
might
believe
every
fact
recorded
concerning
our
lord
and
yet
not
have
the
faith
in
him
that
god
wishes
him
to
have
yes
certainly
but
will
you
say
the
converse
of
that
is
true
explain
please
will
you
say
a
man
may
have
the
faith
god
cares
for
without
the
faith
you
say
he
does
not
care
for
i
did
say
that
god
does
not
care
about
our
having
assurance
of
the
facts
for
surely
if
every
thing
depends
on
those
facts
much
will
depend
on
the
degree
of
our
assurance
concerning
them
i
only
expressed
a
doubt
whether
in
the
present
age
he
cares
that
we
should
have
that
assurance
first
perhaps
he
means
it
to
be
the
result
of
the
higher
kind
of
faith
which
rests
in
the
will
i
do
at
the
moment
see
how
the
higher
faith
as
you
call
it
can
precede
the
lower
it
seems
to
me
possible
enough
for
what
is
the
test
of
discipleship
the
lord
lays
down
is
it
not
obedience
ye
love
me
keep
my
commandments
a
man
love
me
he
will
keep
my
commandments
never
knew
you
depart
from
me
ye
workers
of
iniquity
suppose
a
man
feels
in
himself
that
he
must
have
some
saviour
or
perish
suppose
he
feels
drawn
by
conscience
by
admiration
by
early
memories
to
the
form
of
jesus
dimly
seen
through
the
mists
of
ages
suppose
he
can
not
be
sure
there
ever
was
such
a
man
but
reads
about
him
and
ponders
over
the
words
attributed
to
him
until
he
feels
they
are
the
right
thing
whether
said
them
or
not
and
that
if
he
could
but
be
sure
there
were
such
a
being
he
would
believe
in
him
with
heart
and
soul
suppose
also
that
he
comes
upon
the
words
any
man
is
willing
to
do
the
will
of
the
father
he
shall
know
whether
i
speak
of
myself
or
he
sent
me
suppose
all
these
things
might
not
the
man
then
say
to
himself
can
not
tell
whether
all
this
is
true
but
i
know
nothing
that
seems
half
so
good
and
i
will
try
to
do
the
will
of
the
father
in
the
hope
of
the
promised
knowledge
do
you
think
god
would
or
would
not
count
that
to
the
man
for
faith
i
had
no
more
to
say
and
a
silence
followed
after
a
pause
of
some
duration
percivale
said
i
will
go
with
you
my
dear
and
that
was
all
his
answer
when
we
came
out
of
the
little
chapel
the
same
into
which
marion
had
stepped
on
that
evening
so
memorable
to
her
we
walked
homeward
in
silence
and
reached
our
own
door
ere
a
word
was
spoken
but
when
i
went
to
take
off
my
things
percivale
followed
me
into
the
room
and
said
whether
that
man
is
of
the
facts
or
not
i
can
not
tell
yet
but
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
he
believes
in
the
manner
of
which
you
were
speaking
that
of
obedience
wynnie
he
must
believe
with
his
heart
and
will
and
life
if
so
he
can
well
afford
to
wait
for
what
light
god
will
give
him
on
things
that
belong
to
the
intellect
and
judgment
i
would
rather
think
he
returned
that
purity
of
life
must
on
the
judgment
so
as
to
make
it
likewise
clear
and
enable
it
to
recognize
the
true
force
of
the
evidence
at
command
that
is
how
my
father
came
to
believe
i
said
he
seems
to
me
to
rest
his
conviction
more
upon
external
proof
that
is
only
because
it
is
easier
to
talk
about
he
told
me
once
that
he
was
never
able
to
estimate
the
force
and
weight
of
the
external
arguments
until
after
he
had
believed
for
the
very
love
of
the
eternal
truth
he
saw
in
the
story
his
heart
he
said
had
been
the
guide
of
his
intellect
that
is
just
what
i
would
fain
believe
but
o
wynnie
the
pity
of
it
if
that
story
should
not
be
true
after
all
ah
my
love
i
cried
that
very
word
makes
me
surer
than
ever
that
it
can
not
but
be
true
let
us
go
on
putting
it
to
the
hardest
test
let
us
try
it
until
it
crumbles
in
our
hands
try
it
by
the
touchstone
of
action
founded
on
its
requirements
there
may
be
no
other
way
said
percivale
after
a
thoughtful
pause
of
becoming
capable
of
recognizing
the
truth
it
may
be
beyond
the
grasp
of
all
but
the
mind
that
has
thus
yielded
to
it
there
may
be
no
contact
for
it
with
any
but
such
a
mind
such
a
conviction
then
could
neither
be
forestalled
nor
communicated
its
very
existence
must
remain
doubtful
until
it
asserts
itself
i
see
that
chapter
xxxii
my
second
terror
please
is
master
fido
to
carry
master
zohrab
about
by
the
back
o
the
neck
said
jemima
in
indignant
appeal
one
afternoon
late
in
november
bursting
into
the
study
where
i
sat
with
my
husband
fido
was
our
bedlington
terrier
which
having
been
reared
by
newcastle
colliers
and
taught
to
draw
a
badger
whatever
that
may
mean
i
am
hazy
about
it
had
a
passion
for
burrowing
after
any
thing
buried
swept
away
by
the
current
of
the
said
passion
he
had
with
his
strong
forepaws
unearthed
poor
zohrab
which
being
a
tortoise
had
ensconced
himself
as
he
thought
for
the
winter
in
the
earth
at
the
foot
of
a
but
now
much
to
his
jeopardy
from
the
cold
and
the
shock
of
the
surprise
more
than
from
the
teeth
of
his
friend
was
being
borne
about
the
garden
in
triumph
though
whether
exactly
as
jemima
described
may
be
questionable
her
indignation
at
the
inroad
of
the
dog
upon
the
personal
rights
of
the
tortoise
had
possibly
not
lessened
her
general
indifference
to
accuracy
alarmed
at
the
danger
to
the
poor
animal
of
a
kind
from
which
his
natural
defences
were
powerless
to
protect
him
percivale
threw
down
his
palette
and
brushes
and
ran
to
the
door
do
put
on
your
coat
and
hat
percivale
i
cried
but
he
was
gone
cold
as
it
was
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
light
blouse
he
had
worn
at
his
work
all
the
summer
the
stove
had
got
and
the
room
was
like
an
oven
while
outside
a
dank
fog
filled
the
air
i
hurried
after
him
with
his
coat
and
found
him
pursuing
fido
about
the
garden
the
brute
declining
to
obey
his
call
or
to
drop
the
tortoise
percivale
was
equally
deaf
to
my
call
and
not
until
he
had
beaten
the
dog
did
he
return
with
the
rescued
tortoise
in
his
hands
the
consequences
were
serious
first
the
death
of
zohrab
and
next
a
terrible
illness
to
my
husband
he
had
caught
cold
it
settled
on
his
lungs
and
passed
into
bronchitis
it
was
a
terrible
time
to
me
for
i
had
no
doubt
for
some
days
that
he
was
dying
the
measures
taken
seemed
thoroughly
futile
it
is
an
awful
moment
when
first
death
looks
in
at
the
door
the
positive
recognition
of
his
presence
is
so
different
from
any
vividest
imagination
of
it
for
the
moment
i
believed
nothing
felt
only
the
coming
blackness
of
absolute
loss
i
cared
neither
for
my
children
nor
for
my
father
or
mother
nothing
appeared
of
any
worth
more
i
had
conscience
enough
left
to
try
to
pray
but
no
prayer
would
rise
from
the
frozen
depths
of
my
spirit
i
could
only
move
about
in
mechanical
and
hopeless
ministration
to
one
whom
it
seemed
of
no
use
to
go
on
loving
any
more
for
what
was
nature
but
a
soulless
machine
the
constant
clank
of
whose
motion
sounded
only
dust
to
dust
dust
to
dust
forevermore
but
i
was
roused
from
this
mood
by
a
look
from
my
husband
who
catching
a
glimpse
of
my
despair
motioned
me
to
him
with
a
smile
as
of
sunshine
upon
snow
and
whispered
in
my
ear
i
afraid
you
have
much
more
faith
than
myself
after
all
wynnie
it
stung
me
into
life
not
for
the
sake
of
my
professions
not
even
for
the
honor
of
our
heavenly
father
but
by
waking
in
me
the
awful
thought
of
my
beloved
passing
through
the
shadow
of
death
with
no
one
beside
him
to
help
or
comfort
him
in
absolute
loneliness
and
uncertainty
the
thought
was
unendurable
for
a
moment
i
wished
he
might
die
suddenly
and
so
escape
the
vacuous
despair
of
a
conscious
lingering
betwixt
life
and
the
something
or
the
nothing
beyond
it
but
i
can
not
go
with
you
i
cried
and
forgetting
all
my
duty
as
a
nurse
i
wept
in
agony
perhaps
another
will
my
wynnie
one
who
knows
the
way
he
whispered
for
he
could
not
speak
aloud
and
closed
his
eyes
it
was
as
if
an
arrow
of
light
had
slain
the
python
coiled
about
my
heart
if
believed
could
believe
also
if
could
encounter
the
vague
dark
could
endure
the
cheerless
light
i
was
myself
again
and
with
one
word
of
endearment
left
the
bedside
to
do
what
had
to
be
done
at
length
a
faint
hope
began
to
glimmer
in
the
depths
of
my
cavernous
fear
it
was
long
ere
it
swelled
into
confidence
but
although
i
was
then
in
somewhat
feeble
health
my
strength
never
gave
way
for
a
whole
week
i
did
not
once
undress
and
for
weeks
i
was
all
the
time
i
slept
the
softest
whisper
would
rouse
me
thoroughly
and
it
was
only
when
marion
took
my
place
that
i
could
sleep
at
all
i
am
afraid
i
neglected
my
poor
children
dreadfully
i
seemed
for
the
time
to
have
no
responsibility
and
even
i
am
ashamed
to
say
little
care
for
them
but
then
i
knew
that
they
were
well
attended
to
friends
were
very
kind
especially
judy
in
taking
them
out
and
marion
daily
visits
were
like
those
of
a
mother
indeed
she
was
able
to
mother
any
thing
human
except
a
baby
to
whom
she
felt
no
attraction
any
more
than
to
the
inferior
animals
for
which
she
had
little
regard
beyond
a
negative
one
she
would
hurt
no
creature
that
was
not
hurtful
but
she
had
scarcely
an
atom
of
kindness
for
dog
or
cat
or
any
thing
that
is
petted
of
woman
it
is
the
only
defect
i
am
aware
of
in
her
character
my
husband
slowly
recovered
but
it
was
months
before
he
was
able
to
do
any
thing
he
would
call
work
but
even
in
labor
success
is
not
only
to
the
strong
working
a
little
at
the
short
best
time
of
the
day
with
him
he
managed
long
before
his
full
recovery
to
paint
a
small
picture
which
better
critics
than
i
have
thought
worthy
of
angelico
i
will
attempt
to
describe
it
through
the
lighted
windows
of
a
great
hall
the
spectator
catches
broken
glimpses
of
a
festive
company
at
the
head
of
the
table
pouring
out
the
red
wine
he
sees
one
like
unto
the
son
of
man
upon
whom
the
eyes
of
all
are
turned
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
seated
high
in
a
gallery
with
rapt
looks
and
quaint
yet
homely
angelican
instruments
he
sees
the
orchestra
pouring
out
their
souls
through
their
strings
and
trumpets
the
hall
is
filled
with
a
jewelly
glow
as
of
light
suppressed
by
color
the
radiating
centre
of
which
is
the
red
wine
on
the
table
while
mingled
wings
of
all
gorgeous
splendors
hovering
in
the
dim
height
are
suffused
and
harmonized
by
the
molten
ruby
tint
that
pervades
the
whole
outside
in
the
drizzly
darkness
stands
a
lonely
man
he
stoops
listening
with
one
ear
laid
almost
against
the
door
his
face
catches
a
ray
of
the
light
reflected
from
a
muddy
pool
in
the
road
it
discloses
features
wan
and
wasted
with
sorrow
and
sickness
but
glorified
with
the
joy
of
the
music
he
is
like
one
who
has
been
four
days
dead
to
whose
body
the
music
has
recalled
the
soul
down
by
his
knee
he
holds
a
violin
fashioned
like
those
of
the
orchestra
within
which
as
he
listens
he
is
tuning
to
their
pitch
to
readers
acquainted
with
a
poem
of
donne
hymn
to
god
my
god
in
my
sickness
this
description
of
mine
will
at
once
suggest
the
origin
of
the
picture
i
had
read
some
verses
of
it
to
him
in
his
convalescence
and
having
heard
them
once
he
requested
them
often
again
the
first
stanza
runs
thus
since
i
am
coming
to
that
holy
room
where
with
the
choir
of
saints
forevermore
i
shall
be
made
thy
musique
as
i
come
i
tune
the
instrument
here
at
the
door
and
what
i
must
do
then
think
here
before
the
painting
is
almost
the
only
one
he
has
yet
refused
to
let
me
see
before
it
was
finished
but
when
it
was
he
hung
it
up
in
my
own
little
room
off
the
study
and
i
became
thoroughly
acquainted
with
it
i
think
i
love
it
more
than
any
thing
else
he
has
done
i
got
him
without
telling
him
why
to
put
a
touch
or
two
to
the
listening
figure
which
made
it
really
like
himself
during
this
period
of
recovery
i
often
came
upon
him
reading
his
greek
new
testament
which
he
would
shove
aside
when
i
entered
at
length
one
morning
i
said
to
him
are
you
ashamed
of
the
new
testament
percivale
one
would
think
it
was
a
bad
book
from
the
way
you
try
to
hide
it
no
my
love
he
said
it
is
only
that
i
am
jealous
of
appearing
to
do
that
from
suffering
and
weakness
only
which
i
did
not
do
when
i
was
strong
and
well
but
sickness
has
opened
my
eyes
a
good
deal
i
think
and
i
am
sure
of
this
much
that
whatever
truth
there
is
here
i
want
it
all
the
same
whether
i
am
feeling
the
want
or
not
i
had
no
idea
what
there
was
in
this
book
would
you
mind
telling
me
i
said
what
made
you
take
to
reading
it
i
will
try
when
i
thought
i
was
dying
a
black
cloud
seemed
to
fall
over
every
thing
it
was
not
so
much
that
i
was
afraid
to
die
although
i
did
dread
the
final
conflict
as
that
i
felt
so
forsaken
and
lonely
it
was
of
little
use
saying
to
myself
that
i
must
be
a
coward
and
that
it
was
the
part
of
a
man
to
meet
his
fate
whatever
it
might
be
with
composure
for
i
saw
nothing
worth
being
brave
about
the
heart
had
melted
out
of
me
there
was
nothing
to
give
me
joy
nothing
for
my
life
to
rest
up
on
no
sense
of
love
at
the
heart
of
things
did
you
feel
something
the
same
that
terrible
day
i
did
i
answered
i
hope
i
never
believed
in
death
all
the
time
and
yet
for
one
fearful
moment
the
skeleton
seemed
to
swell
and
grow
till
he
blotted
out
the
sun
and
the
stars
and
was
himself
all
in
all
while
the
life
beyond
was
too
shadowy
to
show
behind
him
and
so
death
was
victorious
until
the
thought
of
your
loneliness
in
the
dark
valley
broke
the
spell
and
for
your
sake
i
hoped
in
god
again
and
i
thought
with
myself
would
god
set
his
children
down
in
the
dark
and
leave
them
to
cry
aloud
in
anguish
at
the
terrors
of
the
night
would
he
not
make
the
very
darkness
light
about
them
or
if
they
must
pass
through
such
tortures
would
he
not
at
least
let
them
know
that
he
was
with
them
how
then
can
there
be
a
god
then
arose
in
my
mind
all
at
once
the
old
story
how
in
the
person
of
his
son
god
himself
had
passed
through
the
darkness
now
gathering
about
me
had
gone
down
to
the
grave
and
had
conquered
death
by
dying
if
this
was
true
this
was
to
be
a
god
indeed
well
might
he
call
on
us
to
endure
who
had
himself
borne
the
far
heavier
share
if
there
were
an
eternal
life
who
would
perfect
my
life
i
could
be
brave
i
could
endure
what
he
chose
to
lay
upon
me
i
could
go
whither
he
led
and
were
you
able
to
think
all
that
when
you
were
so
ill
my
love
i
said
something
like
it
practically
very
like
it
he
answered
it
kept
growing
in
my
mind
coming
and
going
and
gathering
clearer
shape
i
thought
with
myself
that
if
there
was
a
god
he
certainly
knew
that
i
would
give
myself
to
him
if
i
could
that
if
i
knew
jesus
to
be
verily
and
really
his
son
however
it
might
seem
strange
to
believe
in
him
and
hard
to
obey
him
i
would
try
to
do
so
and
then
a
verse
about
the
smoking
flax
and
the
bruised
reed
came
into
my
head
and
a
great
hope
arose
in
me
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
what
the
good
people
would
call
faith
but
i
had
no
time
and
no
heart
to
think
about
words
i
wanted
god
and
his
christ
a
fresh
spring
of
life
seemed
to
burst
up
in
my
heart
all
the
world
grew
bright
again
i
seemed
to
love
you
and
the
children
twice
as
much
as
before
a
calmness
came
down
upon
my
spirit
which
seemed
to
me
like
nothing
but
the
presence
of
god
and
although
i
dare
say
you
did
not
then
perceive
a
change
i
am
certain
that
the
same
moment
i
began
to
recover
chapter
xxxiii
the
clouds
after
the
rain
but
the
clouds
returned
after
the
rain
it
will
be
easily
understood
how
the
little
money
we
had
in
hand
should
have
rapidly
vanished
during
percivale
illness
while
he
was
making
nothing
the
expenses
of
the
family
went
on
as
usual
and
not
that
only
but
many
little
delicacies
had
to
be
got
for
him
and
the
doctor
was
yet
to
pay
even
up
to
the
time
when
he
had
been
taken
ill
we
had
been
doing
little
better
than
living
from
hand
to
mouth
for
as
often
as
we
thought
income
was
about
to
get
a
few
yards
ahead
in
the
race
with
expense
something
invariably
happened
to
disappoint
us
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
have
no
faculty
for
saving
for
i
have
never
known
any
in
whom
such
was
well
developed
who
would
not
do
things
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
the
savings
of
such
people
seem
to
me
to
come
quite
as
much
off
other
people
as
off
themselves
and
especially
in
regard
of
small
sums
they
are
in
danger
of
being
first
mean
and
then
dishonest
certainly
whoever
makes
saving
end
of
her
life
must
soon
grow
mean
and
will
probably
grow
dishonest
but
i
have
never
succeeded
in
drawing
the
line
betwixt
meanness
and
dishonesty
what
is
mean
so
far
as
i
can
see
slides
by
indistinguishable
gradations
into
what
is
plainly
dishonest
and
what
is
more
the
savings
are
commonly
made
at
the
cost
of
the
defenceless
it
is
better
far
to
live
in
constant
difficulties
than
to
keep
out
of
them
by
such
vile
means
as
must
besides
poison
the
whole
nature
and
make
one
judgments
both
of
god
and
her
neighbors
mean
as
her
own
conduct
it
is
nothing
to
say
that
you
must
be
just
before
you
are
generous
for
that
is
the
very
point
i
am
insisting
on
namely
that
one
must
be
just
to
others
before
she
is
generous
to
herself
it
will
never
do
to
make
your
two
ends
meet
by
pulling
the
other
ends
from
the
hands
of
those
who
are
likewise
puzzled
to
make
them
meet
but
i
must
now
put
myself
at
the
bar
and
cry
for
i
was
often
wrong
on
the
other
side
sometimes
getting
things
for
the
house
before
it
was
quite
clear
i
could
afford
them
and
sometimes
buying
the
best
when
an
inferior
thing
would
have
been
more
suitable
if
not
to
my
ideas
yet
to
my
purse
it
is
however
far
more
difficult
for
one
with
an
uncertain
income
to
learn
to
save
or
even
to
be
prudent
than
for
one
who
knows
how
much
exactly
every
quarter
will
bring
my
husband
while
he
left
the
whole
management
of
money
matters
to
me
would
yet
spend
occasionally
without
consulting
me
in
fact
he
had
no
notion
of
money
and
what
it
would
or
would
not
do
i
never
knew
a
man
spend
less
upon
himself
but
he
would
be
extravagant
for
me
and
i
dared
hardly
utter
a
foolish
liking
lest
he
should
straightway
turn
it
into
a
cause
of
shame
by
attempting
to
gratify
it
he
had
besides
a
weakness
for
people
of
which
neither
marion
nor
i
could
honestly
approve
however
much
we
might
admire
the
disposition
whence
it
proceeded
now
that
i
have
confessed
i
shall
be
more
easy
in
my
mind
for
in
regard
of
the
troubles
that
followed
i
can
not
be
sure
that
i
was
free
of
blame
one
word
more
in
and
i
have
done
however
imperative
it
is
none
the
less
hard
to
cultivate
two
opposing
virtues
at
one
and
the
same
time
while
my
husband
was
ill
not
a
picture
had
been
disposed
of
and
even
after
he
was
able
to
work
a
little
i
could
not
encourage
visitors
he
was
not
able
for
the
fatigue
and
in
fact
shrunk
with
an
irritability
i
had
never
perceived
a
sign
of
before
from
seeing
any
one
to
my
growing
dismay
i
saw
my
little
stock
which
was
bodily
in
my
hand
for
we
had
no
banking
account
rapidly
approaching
its
final
evanishment
some
may
think
that
with
parents
in
the
position
of
mine
a
temporary
difficulty
need
have
caused
me
no
anxiety
i
must
therefore
mention
one
or
two
facts
with
regard
to
both
my
husband
and
my
parents
in
the
first
place
although
he
had
as
complete
a
confidence
in
him
as
i
had
both
in
regard
to
what
he
said
and
what
he
seemed
my
husband
could
not
feel
towards
my
father
as
i
felt
he
had
married
me
as
a
poor
man
who
yet
could
keep
a
wife
and
i
knew
it
would
be
a
bitter
humiliation
to
him
to
ask
my
father
for
money
on
the
ground
that
he
had
given
his
daughter
i
should
have
felt
nothing
of
the
kind
for
i
should
have
known
that
my
father
would
do
him
as
well
as
me
perfect
justice
in
the
matter
and
would
consider
any
money
spent
upon
us
as
used
to
a
divine
purpose
for
he
regarded
the
necessaries
of
life
as
noble
its
comforts
as
honorable
its
luxuries
as
permissible
thus
reversing
altogether
the
usual
judgment
of
rich
men
who
in
general
like
nothing
worse
than
to
leave
their
hoards
to
those
of
their
relatives
who
will
degrade
them
to
the
purchase
of
mere
bread
and
cheese
blankets
and
clothes
and
coals
but
i
had
no
right
to
go
against
my
husband
feeling
so
long
as
the
children
had
their
bread
and
milk
i
would
endure
with
him
i
am
confident
i
could
have
starved
as
well
as
he
and
should
have
enjoyed
letting
him
see
it
but
there
were
reasons
because
of
which
even
i
in
my
fullest
freedom
could
not
have
asked
help
from
my
father
just
at
this
time
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
the
fact
but
i
must
before
the
end
of
his
second
year
at
oxford
just
over
the
elder
of
my
two
brothers
had
without
any
vice
i
firmly
believe
beyond
that
of
thoughtlessness
and
folly
got
himself
so
deeply
mired
in
debt
both
to
tradespeople
and
that
my
father
had
to
pay
two
thousand
pounds
for
him
indeed
as
i
was
well
assured
although
he
never
told
me
so
he
had
to
borrow
part
of
the
money
on
a
fresh
mortgage
in
order
to
clear
him
some
lawyer
i
believe
told
him
that
he
was
not
bound
to
pay
but
my
father
said
that
although
such
creditors
deserved
no
protection
of
the
law
he
was
not
bound
to
give
them
a
lesson
in
honesty
at
the
expense
of
weakening
the
bond
between
himself
and
his
son
for
whose
misdeeds
he
acknowledged
a
large
share
of
responsibility
while
on
the
other
hand
he
was
bound
to
give
his
son
the
lesson
of
the
suffering
brought
on
his
family
by
his
selfishness
and
therefore
would
pay
the
money
if
not
gladly
yet
willingly
how
the
poor
boy
got
through
the
shame
and
misery
of
it
i
can
hardly
imagine
but
this
i
can
say
for
him
that
it
was
purely
of
himself
that
he
accepted
a
situation
in
ceylon
instead
of
returning
to
oxford
thither
he
was
now
on
his
way
with
the
intention
of
saving
all
he
could
in
order
to
repay
his
father
and
if
at
length
he
succeeds
in
doing
so
he
will
doubtless
make
a
fairer
start
the
second
time
because
of
the
discipline
than
if
he
had
gone
out
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
it
was
natural
then
that
in
such
circumstances
a
daughter
should
shrink
from
adding
her
troubles
to
those
caused
by
a
son
i
ought
to
add
that
my
father
had
of
late
been
laying
out
a
good
deal
in
building
cottages
for
the
laborers
on
his
farms
and
that
the
land
was
not
yet
entirely
freed
from
the
mortgages
my
mother
had
inherited
with
it
percivale
continued
so
weak
that
for
some
time
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
say
a
word
to
him
about
money
but
to
keep
them
as
low
as
possible
did
not
prevent
the
household
debts
from
accumulating
and
the
servants
wages
were
on
the
point
of
coming
due
i
had
been
careful
to
keep
the
milkman
paid
and
for
the
rest
of
the
tradesmen
i
consoled
myself
with
the
certainty
that
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
there
was
plenty
of
furniture
in
the
house
to
pay
every
one
of
them
still
of
all
burdens
next
to
sin
that
of
debt
i
think
must
be
heaviest
i
tried
to
keep
cheerful
but
at
length
one
night
during
our
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
which
i
could
not
bear
to
see
my
poor
husband
eating
i
broke
down
what
the
matter
my
darling
asked
percivale
i
took
a
from
my
pocket
and
held
it
out
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
that
all
i
got
percivale
i
said
oh
that
all
is
it
he
returned
lightly
yes
is
that
enough
i
said
with
some
indignation
certainly
for
he
answered
seeing
the
shops
are
shut
but
is
that
all
that
troubling
you
he
went
on
it
seems
to
me
quite
enough
i
said
again
and
if
you
had
the
housekeeping
to
do
and
the
bills
to
pay
you
would
think
a
solitary
quite
enough
to
make
you
miserable
never
mind
so
long
as
it
a
good
one
he
said
i
get
you
more
how
can
you
do
that
i
asked
easily
he
answered
you
see
do
you
trouble
your
dear
heart
about
it
for
a
moment
i
felt
relieved
and
asked
him
no
more
questions
the
next
morning
when
i
went
into
the
study
to
speak
to
him
he
was
not
there
and
i
guessed
that
he
had
gone
to
town
to
get
the
money
for
he
had
not
been
out
before
since
his
illness
at
least
without
me
but
i
hoped
of
all
things
he
was
not
going
to
borrow
it
of
a
of
which
i
had
a
great
and
justifiable
horror
having
heard
from
himself
how
a
friend
of
his
had
in
such
a
case
fared
i
would
have
sold
of
the
things
in
the
house
rather
but
as
i
turned
to
leave
the
study
anxious
both
about
himself
and
his
proceedings
i
thought
something
was
different
and
soon
discovered
that
a
certain
favorite
picture
was
missing
from
the
wall
it
was
clear
he
had
gone
either
to
sell
it
or
raise
money
upon
it
by
our
usual
early
he
returned
and
put
into
my
hands
with
a
look
of
forced
cheerfulness
two
notes
is
that
all
you
got
for
that
picture
i
said
that
is
all
would
advance
me
upon
it
he
answered
i
thought
he
had
made
enough
by
me
to
have
risked
a
little
more
than
that
but
well
never
mind
that
is
enough
to
give
time
for
twenty
things
to
happen
and
no
doubt
twenty
things
did
happen
but
none
of
them
of
the
sort
he
meant
the
ten
pounds
sank
through
my
purse
like
water
through
gravel
i
paid
a
number
of
small
bills
at
once
for
they
pressed
the
more
heavily
upon
me
that
i
knew
the
money
was
wanted
and
by
the
end
of
another
fortnight
we
were
as
badly
off
as
before
with
an
additional
trouble
which
in
the
circumstances
was
any
thing
but
slight
in
conjunction
with
more
than
ordinary
endowments
of
stupidity
and
jemima
was
possessed
of
a
furious
temper
which
showed
itself
occasionally
in
outbursts
of
unendurable
rudeness
she
had
been
again
and
again
on
the
point
of
leaving
me
now
she
now
i
giving
warning
but
ere
the
day
arrived
her
better
nature
had
always
got
the
upper
hand
she
had
broken
down
and
given
in
these
outbursts
had
generally
followed
a
season
of
better
behavior
than
usual
and
were
all
but
certain
if
i
ventured
the
least
commendation
for
she
could
stand
any
thing
better
than
praise
at
the
least
subsequent
rebuke
self
would
break
out
in
rage
vulgarity
and
rudeness
on
this
occasion
however
i
can
not
tell
whence
it
was
that
one
of
these
cyclones
arose
in
our
small
atmosphere
but
it
was
jemima
you
may
well
believe
who
gave
warning
for
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
pay
her
wages
and
there
was
no
sign
of
her
yielding
my
reader
may
be
inclined
to
ask
in
what
stead
the
religion
i
had
learned
of
my
father
now
stood
me
i
will
endeavor
to
be
honest
in
my
answer
every
now
and
then
i
tried
to
pray
to
god
to
deliver
us
but
i
was
far
indeed
from
praying
always
and
still
farther
from
not
fainting
a
whole
day
would
sometimes
pass
under
a
weight
of
care
that
amounted
often
to
misery
and
not
until
its
close
would
i
bethink
me
that
i
had
been
all
the
weary
hours
without
god
even
when
more
hopeful
i
would
keep
looking
and
looking
for
the
impossibility
of
something
to
happen
of
itself
instead
of
looking
for
some
good
and
perfect
gift
to
come
down
from
the
father
of
lights
and
when
i
awoke
to
the
fact
the
fog
would
yet
lie
so
deep
on
my
soul
that
i
could
not
be
sorry
for
my
idolatry
and
want
of
faith
it
was
indeed
a
miserable
time
there
was
besides
one
definite
thought
that
always
choked
my
prayers
i
could
not
say
in
my
conscience
that
i
had
been
sufficiently
careful
either
in
my
management
or
my
expenditure
if
i
thought
i
could
be
certain
that
i
had
done
my
best
i
should
be
able
to
trust
in
god
for
all
that
lies
beyond
my
power
but
now
he
may
mean
to
punish
me
for
my
carelessness
then
why
should
i
not
endure
it
calmly
and
without
complaint
alas
it
was
not
i
alone
that
thus
would
be
punished
but
my
children
and
my
husband
as
well
nor
could
i
avoid
coming
on
my
poor
father
at
last
who
of
course
would
interfere
to
prevent
a
sale
and
the
thought
was
from
the
circumstances
i
have
mentioned
very
bitter
to
me
sometimes
however
in
more
faithful
moods
i
would
reason
with
myself
that
god
would
not
be
hard
upon
me
even
if
i
had
not
been
so
saving
as
i
ought
my
father
had
taken
his
son
debts
on
himself
and
would
not
allow
him
to
be
disgraced
more
than
could
be
helped
and
if
an
earthly
parent
would
act
thus
for
his
child
would
our
father
in
heaven
be
less
tender
with
us
still
for
very
love
sake
it
might
be
necessary
to
lay
some
disgrace
upon
me
for
of
late
i
had
been
thinking
far
too
little
of
the
best
things
the
cares
more
than
the
duties
of
life
had
been
filling
my
mind
if
it
brought
me
nearer
to
god
i
must
then
say
it
had
been
good
for
me
to
be
afflicted
but
while
my
soul
was
thus
oppressed
how
could
my
feelings
have
any
scope
let
come
what
would
however
i
must
try
and
bear
it
even
disgrace
if
it
was
will
better
people
than
i
had
been
thus
disgraced
and
it
might
be
my
turn
next
meantime
it
had
not
come
to
that
and
i
must
not
let
the
cares
of
burden
every
day
almost
as
it
seems
in
looking
back
a
train
of
thought
something
like
this
would
pass
through
my
mind
but
things
went
on
and
grew
no
better
with
gathering
rapidity
we
went
sliding
to
all
appearance
down
the
inclined
plane
of
disgrace
percivale
at
length
asked
roger
if
he
had
any
money
by
him
to
lend
him
a
little
and
he
gave
him
at
once
all
he
had
amounting
to
six
pounds
a
wonderful
amount
for
roger
to
have
accumulated
with
the
help
of
which
we
got
on
to
the
end
of
jemima
month
the
next
step
i
had
in
view
was
to
take
my
little
valuables
to
the
pawnbroker
amongst
them
a
watch
whose
face
was
encircled
with
a
row
of
diamonds
it
had
belonged
to
my
and
my
mother
had
given
it
me
when
i
was
married
we
had
had
a
piece
of
boiled
neck
of
mutton
for
dinner
of
which
we
that
is
my
husband
and
i
had
partaken
sparingly
in
order
that
there
might
be
enough
for
the
servants
percivale
had
gone
out
and
i
was
sitting
in
the
lost
in
any
thing
but
a
blessed
reverie
with
all
the
children
chattering
amongst
themselves
beside
me
when
jemima
entered
looking
subdued
if
you
please
this
is
my
day
she
said
have
you
got
a
place
then
jemima
i
asked
for
i
had
been
so
much
occupied
with
my
own
affairs
that
i
had
thought
little
of
the
future
of
the
poor
girl
to
whom
i
could
have
given
but
a
lukewarm
recommendation
for
any
thing
prized
amongst
housekeepers
no
please
may
i
stop
no
jemima
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
ca
afford
to
keep
you
i
shall
have
to
do
all
the
work
myself
when
you
are
gone
i
thought
to
pay
her
wages
out
of
the
proceeds
of
my
jewels
but
was
willing
to
delay
the
step
as
long
as
possible
rather
i
believe
from
repugnance
to
enter
the
than
from
disinclination
to
part
with
the
trinkets
but
as
soon
as
i
had
spoken
jemima
burst
into
an
irish
wail
mingled
with
sobs
and
tears
crying
between
the
convulsions
of
all
three
i
thought
there
was
something
wrong
you
and
master
looked
so
please
do
send
me
away
i
never
wanted
to
send
you
away
jemima
you
wanted
to
go
yourself
no
i
did
i
only
wanted
you
to
ask
me
to
stop
wirra
wirra
it
myself
is
sorry
i
was
so
rude
it
not
me
it
my
temper
i
do
believe
i
was
born
with
a
devil
inside
me
i
could
not
help
laughing
partly
from
amusement
partly
from
relief
but
you
see
i
ca
ask
you
to
stop
i
said
i
got
no
money
not
even
enough
to
pay
you
so
i
ca
keep
you
i
do
want
no
money
let
me
stop
and
i
cook
for
yez
and
wash
and
scrub
for
yez
to
the
end
o
my
days
an
i
eat
no
more
than
keep
the
life
in
me
i
eat
something
or
the
smell
o
the
meat
would
turn
me
sick
ye
see
and
then
i
should
be
no
good
to
yez
please
i
ha
got
fifteen
pounds
in
the
savings
bank
i
give
ye
all
that
if
ye
let
me
stop
wid
ye
when
i
confess
that
i
burst
out
crying
my
reader
will
be
kind
enough
to
take
into
consideration
that
i
had
had
much
to
eat
for
some
time
that
i
was
therefore
weak
in
body
as
well
as
in
mind
and
that
this
was
the
first
gleam
of
sunshine
i
had
had
for
many
weeks
thank
you
very
much
jemima
i
said
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
i
take
your
money
for
then
you
would
be
as
poor
as
i
am
but
if
you
would
like
to
stop
with
us
you
shall
and
i
wo
pay
you
till
i
able
the
poor
girl
was
profuse
in
her
thanks
and
left
the
room
sobbing
in
her
apron
it
was
a
gloomy
drizzly
dreary
afternoon
the
children
were
hard
to
amuse
and
i
was
glad
when
their
bedtime
arrived
it
was
getting
late
before
percivale
returned
he
looked
pale
and
i
found
afterwards
that
he
had
walked
home
he
had
got
wet
and
had
to
change
some
of
his
clothes
when
we
went
in
to
supper
there
was
the
neck
of
mutton
on
the
table
almost
as
we
had
left
it
this
led
me
before
asking
him
any
questions
to
relate
what
had
passed
with
jemima
at
which
news
he
laughed
merrily
and
was
evidently
a
good
deal
relieved
then
i
asked
him
where
he
had
been
to
the
city
he
answered
have
you
sold
another
picture
i
asked
with
an
inward
tribulation
half
hope
half
fear
for
much
as
we
wanted
the
money
i
could
ill
bear
the
thought
of
his
pictures
going
for
the
price
of
mere
no
he
replied
the
last
is
stopping
the
way
has
been
advertising
it
as
a
bargain
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
but
he
has
sold
it
yet
and
ca
he
says
risk
ten
pounds
on
another
what
to
come
of
it
i
do
know
he
added
but
meantime
it
a
comfort
that
jemima
can
wait
a
bit
for
money
as
we
sat
at
supper
i
thought
i
saw
a
look
on
percivale
face
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
all
at
once
while
i
was
wondering
what
it
might
mean
after
a
long
pause
during
which
we
had
been
both
looking
into
the
fire
he
said
wynnie
i
going
to
paint
a
better
picture
than
i
ever
painted
yet
i
can
and
i
will
but
how
are
we
to
live
in
the
mean
time
i
said
his
face
fell
and
i
saw
with
shame
what
a
job
comforter
i
was
instead
of
sympathizing
with
his
ardor
i
had
quenched
it
what
if
my
foolish
remark
had
ruined
a
great
picture
anyhow
it
had
wounded
a
great
heart
which
had
turned
to
labor
as
its
plainest
duty
and
would
thereby
have
been
strengthened
to
endure
and
to
hope
it
was
too
cruel
of
me
i
knelt
by
his
knee
and
told
him
i
was
both
ashamed
and
sorry
i
had
been
so
faithless
and
unkind
he
made
little
of
it
said
i
might
well
ask
the
question
and
even
tried
to
be
merry
over
it
but
i
could
see
well
enough
that
i
had
let
a
gust
of
the
foggy
night
into
his
soul
and
was
thoroughly
vexed
with
myself
we
went
to
bed
gloomy
but
slept
well
and
awoke
more
cheerful
chapter
xxxiv
the
sunshine
as
we
were
dressing
it
came
into
my
mind
that
i
had
forgotten
to
give
him
a
letter
which
had
arrived
the
night
before
i
commonly
opened
his
letters
but
i
had
not
opened
this
one
for
it
looked
like
a
business
letter
and
i
feared
it
might
be
a
demand
for
the
rent
of
the
house
which
was
over
due
indeed
at
this
time
i
dreaded
opening
any
letter
the
writing
on
which
i
did
not
recognize
here
is
a
letter
percivale
i
said
i
sorry
i
forgot
to
give
it
you
last
night
who
is
it
from
he
asked
talking
through
his
towel
from
his
i
do
know
i
did
open
it
it
looks
like
something
disagreeable
open
it
now
then
and
see
i
ca
just
at
this
moment
i
answered
for
i
had
my
back
hair
half
twisted
in
my
hands
there
it
is
on
the
he
came
in
took
it
and
opened
it
while
i
went
on
with
my
toilet
suddenly
his
arms
were
round
me
and
i
felt
his
cheek
on
mine
read
that
he
said
putting
the
letter
into
my
hand
it
was
from
a
lawyer
in
shrewsbury
informing
him
that
his
with
whom
he
had
been
a
great
favorite
when
a
boy
was
dead
and
had
left
him
three
hundred
pounds
it
was
like
a
reprieve
to
one
about
to
be
executed
i
could
only
weep
and
thank
god
once
more
believing
in
my
father
in
heaven
but
it
was
a
humbling
thought
that
if
he
had
not
thus
helped
me
i
might
have
ceased
to
believe
in
him
i
saw
plainly
that
let
me
talk
to
percivale
as
i
might
my
own
faith
was
but
a
wretched
thing
it
is
all
very
well
to
have
noble
theories
about
god
but
where
is
the
good
of
them
except
we
actually
trust
in
him
as
a
real
present
living
loving
being
who
counts
us
of
more
value
than
many
sparrows
and
will
not
let
one
of
them
fall
to
the
ground
without
him
i
thought
wynnie
if
there
was
such
a
god
as
you
believed
in
and
with
you
to
pray
to
him
we
should
be
long
without
a
hearing
said
my
husband
there
was
more
faith
in
his
heart
all
the
time
though
he
could
not
profess
the
belief
i
thought
i
had
than
there
ever
was
in
mine
but
our
troubles
were
nearly
over
yet
percivale
wrote
acknowledging
the
letter
and
requesting
to
know
when
it
would
be
convenient
to
let
him
have
the
money
as
he
was
in
immediate
want
of
it
the
reply
was
that
the
trustees
were
not
bound
to
pay
the
legacies
for
a
year
but
that
possibly
they
might
stretch
a
point
in
his
favor
if
he
applied
to
them
percivale
did
so
but
received
a
very
curt
answer
with
little
encouragement
to
expect
any
thing
but
the
extreme
of
legal
delay
he
received
the
money
however
about
four
months
after
lightened
to
the
great
disappointment
of
my
ignorance
of
thirty
pounds
in
the
mean
time
although
our
minds
were
much
relieved
and
percivale
was
working
away
at
his
new
picture
with
great
energy
and
courage
the
immediate
pressure
of
circumstances
was
nearly
as
painful
as
ever
it
was
a
comfort
however
to
know
that
we
might
borrow
on
the
security
of
the
legacy
but
greatly
grudging
the
loss
of
the
interest
which
that
would
involve
i
would
have
persuaded
percivale
to
ask
a
loan
of
lady
bernard
he
objected
on
what
ground
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
lady
bernard
to
be
repaid
the
sum
she
had
lent
us
he
would
have
finally
consented
however
i
have
little
doubt
had
the
absolute
necessity
for
borrowing
arrived
about
a
week
or
ten
days
after
the
blessed
news
he
had
a
note
from
whom
he
had
authorized
to
part
with
the
picture
for
thirty
guineas
how
much
this
was
under
its
value
it
is
not
easy
to
say
seeing
the
of
pictures
is
dependent
on
so
many
things
but
if
the
fairy
godmother
executors
had
paid
her
legacy
at
once
that
picture
would
not
have
been
sold
for
less
than
five
times
the
amount
and
i
may
mention
that
the
last
time
it
changed
hands
it
fetched
five
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
wrote
that
he
had
an
offer
of
five
and
twenty
for
it
desiring
to
know
whether
he
might
sell
it
for
that
sum
percivale
at
once
gave
his
consent
and
the
next
day
received
a
check
for
eleven
pounds
odd
shillings
the
difference
being
the
borrowed
amount
upon
it
its
interest
the
commission
charged
on
the
sale
and
the
price
of
a
small
the
next
day
percivale
had
a
visitor
at
the
studio
no
less
a
person
than
baddeley
with
his
in
full
blossom
and
his
diamond
wallowing
in
light
on
his
fifth
finger
i
can
not
call
it
his
little
finger
for
his
hands
were
as
huge
as
they
were
soft
and
white
hands
descended
of
generations
of
laborious
ones
but
which
had
never
themselves
done
any
work
beyond
paddling
in
money
he
greeted
percivale
with
a
jolly
condescension
and
told
him
that
having
seen
and
rather
liked
a
picture
of
his
the
other
day
he
had
come
to
inquire
whether
he
had
one
that
would
do
for
a
pendant
to
it
as
he
should
like
to
have
it
provided
he
did
not
want
a
fancy
price
for
it
percivale
felt
as
if
he
were
setting
out
his
children
for
sale
as
he
invited
him
to
look
about
the
room
and
turned
round
a
few
from
against
the
wall
the
great
man
flitted
hither
and
thither
spying
at
one
after
another
through
the
cylinder
of
his
curved
hand
percivale
going
on
with
his
painting
as
if
no
one
were
there
how
much
do
you
want
for
this
sketch
asked
baddeley
at
length
pointing
to
one
of
the
most
highly
finished
paintings
in
the
room
i
put
three
hundred
on
it
at
the
academy
exhibition
answered
percivale
my
friends
thought
it
too
little
but
as
it
has
been
on
my
hands
a
long
time
now
and
pictures
do
rise
in
price
in
the
keeping
of
the
painter
i
should
mind
taking
two
for
it
two
tens
i
suppose
you
mean
said
baddeley
i
gave
him
a
look
said
percivale
as
he
described
the
interview
to
me
and
i
knew
as
well
as
if
i
had
seen
it
what
kind
of
a
phenomenon
that
look
must
have
been
come
now
baddeley
went
on
perhaps
misinterpreting
the
look
for
it
was
such
as
a
man
of
his
property
was
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
you
must
think
i
made
of
money
or
that
i
a
green
hand
in
the
market
i
know
what
your
pictures
fetch
and
i
a
pretty
sharp
man
of
business
i
believe
what
do
you
really
mean
to
say
and
stick
to
ready
money
you
know
three
hundred
said
percivale
coolly
why
mr
percivale
cried
baddeley
drawing
himself
up
as
my
husband
said
with
the
air
of
one
who
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
i
paid
fifty
pounds
neither
more
nor
less
for
a
picture
of
yours
yesterday
a
picture
allow
me
to
say
worth
he
turned
again
to
the
one
in
question
with
a
critical
air
as
if
about
to
estimate
to
a
fraction
its
value
as
compared
with
the
other
worth
three
of
that
some
people
think
said
percivale
the
price
of
this
then
joking
aside
is
three
hundred
pounds
answered
percivale
i
know
well
how
quietly
i
understood
you
wished
to
sell
it
said
baddeley
beginning
for
all
his
good
nature
to
look
offended
as
well
he
might
i
do
wish
to
sell
it
i
happen
to
be
in
want
of
money
then
i
be
liberal
and
offer
you
the
same
i
paid
for
the
other
send
you
a
check
this
afternoon
for
fifty
with
pleasure
you
can
not
have
that
picture
under
three
hundred
why
said
the
rich
man
puzzled
you
offered
it
for
two
hundred
not
five
minutes
ago
yes
and
you
pretended
to
think
i
meant
two
tens
offended
you
i
fear
at
all
events
betrayed
so
much
ignorance
of
painting
that
i
would
rather
not
have
a
picture
of
mine
in
your
house
you
the
first
man
ever
presumed
to
tell
me
i
was
ignorant
of
painting
said
baddeley
now
thoroughly
indignant
you
have
heard
the
truth
then
for
the
first
time
said
percivale
and
resumed
his
work
baddeley
walked
out
of
the
study
i
am
not
sure
that
he
was
so
very
ignorant
he
had
been
in
the
way
of
buying
popular
pictures
for
some
time
paying
thousands
for
certain
of
them
i
suspect
he
had
eye
enough
to
see
that
my
husband
would
probably
rise
in
value
and
with
the
true
huckster
spirit
was
ambitious
of
boasting
how
little
he
had
given
compared
with
what
they
were
really
worth
percivale
in
this
case
was
doubtless
rude
he
had
an
insuperable
aversion
to
men
of
baddeley
class
men
who
could
have
no
position
but
for
their
money
and
who
yet
presumed
upon
it
as
if
it
were
gifts
and
graces
genius
and
learning
judgment
and
art
all
in
one
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
the
plutocracy
as
he
called
it
ought
to
be
put
down
that
is
negatively
and
honestly
by
showing
them
no
more
respect
than
you
really
entertained
for
them
besides
although
he
had
no
great
favors
for
cousin
judy
husband
he
yet
bore
baddeley
a
grudge
for
the
way
in
which
he
had
treated
one
with
whom
while
things
went
well
with
him
he
had
been
ready
enough
to
exchange
hospitalities
before
long
through
lady
bernard
he
sold
a
picture
at
a
fair
price
and
soon
after
seeing
in
a
the
one
had
sold
to
baddeley
marked
ten
pounds
went
in
and
bought
it
within
the
year
he
sold
it
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
by
working
day
and
night
almost
he
finished
his
new
picture
in
time
for
the
academy
and
as
he
had
himself
predicted
it
proved
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
all
his
artist
friends
the
best
that
he
had
ever
painted
it
was
bought
at
once
for
three
hundred
pounds
and
never
since
then
have
we
been
in
want
of
money
chapter
xxxv
what
lady
bernard
thought
of
it
my
reader
may
wonder
that
in
my
record
of
these
troubles
i
have
never
mentioned
marion
the
fact
is
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
tell
her
of
them
partly
because
she
was
in
some
trouble
herself
from
strangers
who
had
taken
rooms
in
the
house
and
made
mischief
between
her
and
her
grandchildren
and
partly
because
i
knew
she
would
insist
on
going
to
lady
bernard
and
although
i
should
not
have
minded
it
myself
i
knew
that
nothing
but
seeing
the
children
hungry
would
have
driven
my
husband
to
consent
to
it
one
evening
after
it
was
all
over
i
told
lady
bernard
the
story
she
allowed
me
to
finish
it
without
saying
a
word
when
i
had
ended
she
still
sat
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
laying
her
hand
on
my
arm
said
my
dear
child
you
were
very
wrong
as
well
as
very
unkind
why
did
you
not
let
me
know
because
my
husband
would
never
have
allowed
me
i
answered
then
i
must
have
a
talk
with
your
husband
she
said
i
wish
you
would
i
replied
for
i
ca
help
thinking
percivale
too
severe
about
such
things
the
very
next
day
she
called
and
did
have
a
talk
with
him
in
the
study
to
the
following
effect
i
have
come
to
quarrel
with
you
percivale
said
lady
bernard
i
sorry
to
hear
it
he
returned
you
the
last
person
i
should
like
to
quarrel
with
for
it
would
imply
some
unpardonable
fault
in
me
it
does
imply
a
fault
and
a
great
one
she
rejoined
though
i
trust
not
an
unpardonable
one
that
depends
on
whether
you
can
repent
of
it
she
spoke
with
such
a
serious
air
that
percivale
grew
uneasy
and
began
to
wonder
what
he
could
possibly
have
done
to
offend
her
i
had
told
him
nothing
of
our
conversation
wishing
her
to
have
her
own
way
with
him
when
she
saw
him
troubled
she
smiled
is
it
not
a
fault
percivale
to
prevent
one
from
obeying
the
divine
law
of
bearing
another
burden
but
said
percivale
i
read
as
well
that
every
man
shall
bear
his
own
burden
ah
returned
lady
bernard
but
i
learn
from
conybeare
that
two
different
greek
words
are
there
used
which
we
translate
only
by
the
english
i
can
not
tell
you
what
they
are
i
can
only
tell
you
the
practical
result
we
are
to
bear
one
another
burdens
of
pain
or
grief
or
misfortune
or
doubt
whatever
weighs
one
down
is
to
be
borne
by
another
but
the
man
who
is
tempted
to
exalt
himself
over
his
neighbor
is
taught
to
remember
that
he
has
his
own
load
of
disgrace
to
bear
and
answer
for
it
is
just
a
weaker
form
of
the
lesson
of
the
mote
and
the
beam
you
can
not
get
out
at
that
door
percivale
i
beg
you
will
read
the
passage
in
your
greek
testament
and
see
if
you
have
not
misapplied
it
you
to
have
let
me
bear
your
burden
well
you
see
my
dear
lady
bernard
returned
percivale
at
a
loss
to
reply
to
such
a
vigorous
assault
i
knew
how
it
would
be
you
would
have
come
here
and
bought
pictures
you
did
want
and
i
knowing
all
the
time
you
did
it
only
to
give
me
the
money
should
have
had
to
talk
to
you
as
if
i
were
taken
in
by
it
and
i
really
could
stand
it
there
you
are
altogether
wrong
besides
depriving
me
of
the
opportunity
of
fulfilling
a
duty
and
of
the
pleasure
and
the
honor
of
helping
you
to
bear
your
burden
you
have
deprived
me
of
the
opportunity
of
indulging
a
positive
passion
for
pictures
i
am
constantly
compelled
to
restrain
it
lest
i
should
spend
too
much
of
the
money
given
me
for
the
common
good
on
my
own
private
tastes
but
here
was
a
chance
for
me
i
might
have
had
some
of
your
lovely
pictures
in
my
now
with
a
good
conscience
and
a
happy
heart
if
you
had
only
been
friendly
it
was
too
bad
of
you
percivale
i
am
not
pretending
in
the
least
when
i
assert
that
i
am
really
and
thoroughly
disappointed
i
have
a
word
to
say
for
myself
returned
percivale
you
could
have
said
a
better
rejoined
lady
bernard
but
i
hope
you
will
never
have
to
say
it
again
that
i
shall
not
if
ever
i
find
myself
in
any
difficulty
worth
speaking
of
i
will
let
you
know
at
once
thank
you
then
we
are
friends
again
and
now
i
do
think
i
am
entitled
to
a
picture
at
least
i
think
it
will
be
pardonable
if
i
yield
to
the
strong
temptation
i
am
under
at
this
moment
to
buy
one
let
me
see
what
have
you
in
the
as
your
wife
calls
it
she
bought
the
street
musician
as
percivale
had
named
the
picture
taken
from
donne
i
was
more
miserable
than
i
ought
to
have
been
when
i
found
he
had
parted
with
it
but
it
was
a
great
consolation
to
think
it
was
to
lady
bernard
it
had
gone
she
was
the
only
one
except
my
mother
or
miss
clare
i
could
have
borne
to
think
of
as
having
become
its
possessor
he
had
asked
her
what
i
thought
a
very
low
price
for
it
and
i
judge
that
lady
bernard
thought
the
same
but
after
what
had
passed
between
them
would
not
venture
to
expostulate
with
such
a
man
as
my
husband
i
fancy
she
thought
it
best
to
let
well
alone
anyhow
one
day
soon
after
this
her
servant
brought
him
a
little
box
containing
a
fine
brilliant
the
good
lady
kindness
is
said
my
husband
as
he
placed
it
on
his
finger
i
shall
be
hard
up
though
before
i
part
with
this
wynnie
i
actually
got
a
finer
diamond
than
baddeley
it
a
beauty
if
ever
there
was
one
my
husband
with
all
his
carelessness
of
dress
and
adornment
has
almost
a
passion
for
stones
it
is
delightful
to
hear
him
talk
about
them
but
he
had
never
possessed
a
single
gem
before
lady
bernard
made
him
this
present
i
believe
he
is
child
enough
to
be
happier
for
it
all
his
life
chapter
xxxvi
retrospective
suddenly
i
become
aware
that
i
am
drawing
nigh
the
close
of
my
monthly
labors
for
a
long
year
yet
the
year
seems
to
have
passed
more
rapidly
because
of
this
addition
to
my
anxieties
not
that
i
have
enjoyed
the
labor
while
i
have
been
actually
engaged
in
it
but
the
prospect
of
the
next
month
work
would
often
come
in
to
damp
the
pleasure
of
the
present
making
me
fancy
as
the
close
of
each
chapter
drew
near
that
i
should
not
have
material
for
another
left
in
my
head
i
heard
a
friend
once
remark
that
it
is
not
the
cares
of
but
the
cares
of
that
weigh
a
man
down
for
the
day
we
have
the
corresponding
strength
given
for
the
morrow
we
are
told
to
trust
it
is
not
ours
yet
when
i
get
my
money
for
my
work
i
mean
to
give
my
husband
a
long
holiday
i
half
think
of
taking
him
to
italy
for
of
course
i
can
do
what
i
like
with
my
own
whether
husband
or
money
and
so
have
a
hand
in
making
him
a
still
better
painter
incapable
of
imitation
the
sight
of
any
real
work
is
always
of
great
service
to
him
widening
his
sense
of
art
enlarging
his
idea
of
what
can
be
done
rousing
what
part
of
his
being
is
most
in
sympathy
with
it
a
part
possibly
as
yet
only
half
awake
in
a
word
leading
him
another
step
towards
that
simplicity
which
is
at
the
root
of
all
diversity
being
so
simple
that
it
needs
all
diversity
to
set
it
forth
how
impossible
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
should
ever
write
a
book
well
or
ill
done
it
is
almost
finished
for
the
next
month
is
the
twelfth
i
must
look
back
upon
what
i
have
written
to
see
what
loose
ends
i
may
have
left
and
whether
any
allusion
has
not
been
followed
up
with
a
needful
explanation
for
this
way
of
writing
by
portions
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
have
been
persuaded
to
attempt
the
work
however
is
unfavorable
to
artistic
unity
an
unnecessary
remark
seeing
that
to
such
unity
my
work
makes
no
pretensions
it
is
but
a
collection
of
portions
detached
from
an
uneventful
ordinary
and
perhaps
in
part
very
blessed
life
hence
perhaps
it
was
specially
fitted
for
this
mode
of
publication
at
all
events
i
can
cast
upon
it
none
of
the
blame
of
what
failure
i
may
have
to
confess
a
biography
can
not
be
constructed
with
the
art
of
a
novel
for
this
reason
that
a
novel
is
constructed
on
the
artist
scale
with
curves
a
biography
on
the
divine
scale
whose
circles
are
so
large
that
they
shoot
beyond
this
world
sometimes
even
before
we
are
able
to
detect
in
them
the
curve
by
which
they
will
at
length
round
themselves
back
towards
completion
hence
every
life
must
look
more
or
less
fragmentary
and
more
or
less
out
of
drawing
perhaps
not
to
mention
the
questionable
effects
in
color
and
tone
where
the
model
himself
will
insist
on
taking
palette
and
brushes
and
laying
childish
if
not
passionate
conceited
ambitious
or
even
spiteful
hands
to
the
work
i
do
not
find
that
i
have
greatly
blundered
or
omitted
much
that
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
one
odd
thing
is
that
in
the
opening
conversation
in
which
they
urge
me
to
the
attempt
i
have
not
mentioned
marion
i
do
not
mean
that
she
was
present
but
that
surely
some
one
must
have
suggested
her
and
her
history
as
affording
endless
material
for
my
record
a
thing
apparently
but
not
really
strange
is
that
i
have
never
said
a
word
about
the
cromwell
mentioned
in
the
same
conversation
the
fact
is
that
i
have
but
just
arrived
at
the
part
of
my
story
where
she
first
comes
in
she
died
about
three
months
ago
and
i
can
therefore
with
the
more
freedom
narrate
in
the
next
chapter
what
i
have
known
of
her
i
find
also
that
i
have
in
the
fourth
chapter
by
some
odd
freak
substituted
the
name
of
my
aunt
for
that
of
my
aunt
millicent
another
sister
of
my
father
whom
he
has
not
i
believe
had
occasion
to
mention
in
either
of
his
preceding
books
my
aunt
martha
is
weir
and
has
no
children
my
aunt
millicent
is
parsons
married
to
a
attorney
and
has
twelve
children
now
mostly
grown
up
i
find
also
in
the
thirteenth
chapter
an
unexplained
allusion
there
my
husband
says
just
ask
my
brother
his
experience
in
regard
of
the
word
to
which
you
object
the
word
was
at
the
use
of
which
i
had
in
my
taken
umbrage
however
disagreeable
a
word
in
itself
surely
a
husband
might
if
need
be
use
it
without
offence
it
will
be
proof
enough
that
my
objection
arose
from
pure
when
i
state
that
i
have
since
asked
roger
to
what
percivale
referred
his
reply
was
that
having
been
requested
by
a
certain
person
who
had
a
school
for
young
ladies
probably
she
called
it
a
college
to
give
her
pupils
a
few
lectures
on
physiology
he
could
not
go
far
in
the
course
without
finding
it
necessary
to
make
a
not
unfrequent
use
of
the
word
explaining
the
functions
of
the
organ
to
which
the
name
belonged
as
resembling
those
of
a
mill
after
the
lecture
was
over
the
took
him
aside
and
said
she
really
could
not
allow
her
young
ladies
to
be
made
familiar
with
such
words
roger
averred
that
the
word
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
subject
upon
which
she
had
desired
his
lectures
and
that
he
did
not
know
how
any
instruction
in
physiology
could
be
given
without
the
free
use
of
it
no
doubt
she
returned
you
must
recognize
the
existence
of
the
organ
in
question
but
as
the
name
of
it
is
offensive
to
ears
polite
could
you
not
substitute
another
you
have
just
said
that
its
operations
resemble
those
of
a
mill
could
you
not
as
often
as
you
require
to
speak
of
it
refer
to
it
in
the
future
as
roger
with
great
difficulty
repressing
his
laughter
consented
but
in
his
next
lecture
made
far
more
frequent
reference
to
than
was
necessary
using
the
word
every
time
i
know
exactly
how
with
a
certain
absurd
solemnity
that
must
have
been
irresistible
the
girls
went
into
fits
of
laughter
at
the
first
utterance
of
it
and
seemed
he
said
during
the
whole
lecture
intent
only
on
the
new
term
at
every
recurrence
of
which
their
laughter
burst
out
afresh
doubtless
their
had
herself
prepared
them
to
fall
into
roger
trap
the
same
night
he
received
a
note
from
her
enclosing
his
fee
for
the
lectures
given
and
informing
him
that
the
rest
of
the
course
would
not
be
required
roger
sent
back
the
money
saying
that
to
accept
part
payment
would
be
to
renounce
his
claim
for
the
whole
and
that
besides
he
had
already
received
an
amount
of
amusement
quite
sufficient
to
reward
him
for
his
labor
i
told
him
i
thought
he
had
been
rather
cruel
but
he
said
such
a
woman
wanted
a
lesson
he
said
also
that
to
see
the
sort
of
women
who
sometimes
had
the
responsibility
of
training
girls
must
make
the
angels
weep
none
but
a
heartless
mortal
like
himself
could
laugh
where
conventionality
and
insincerity
were
taught
in
every
hint
as
to
posture
and
speech
it
was
bad
enough
he
said
to
shape
yourself
into
your
own
ideal
but
to
have
to
fashion
yourself
after
the
ideal
of
one
whose
sole
object
in
teaching
was
to
make
money
was
something
wretched
indeed
i
find
besides
that
several
intentions
i
had
when
i
started
have
fallen
out
of
the
scheme
somehow
the
subjects
would
not
well
come
in
or
i
felt
that
i
was
in
danger
of
injuring
the
persons
in
the
attempt
to
set
forth
their
opinions
chapter
xxxvii
cromwell
comes
the
moment
the
legacy
was
paid
our
liabilities
being
already
nearly
discharged
my
husband
took
us
all
to
hastings
i
had
never
before
been
to
any
other
seacoast
town
where
the
land
was
worthy
of
the
sea
except
kilkhaven
assuredly
there
is
no
place
within
easy
reach
of
london
to
be
once
mentioned
with
hastings
of
course
we
kept
clear
of
the
more
fashionable
and
commonplace
leonard
end
where
yet
the
sea
is
the
same
a
sea
such
that
not
even
off
cornwall
have
i
seen
so
many
varieties
of
the
immediate
shore
with
its
earthy
cliffs
is
vastly
inferior
to
the
magnificent
rock
about
tintagel
but
there
is
no
outlook
on
the
sea
that
i
know
more
satisfying
than
that
from
the
heights
of
hastings
especially
the
east
hill
from
the
west
side
of
which
also
you
may
when
weary
of
the
ocean
look
straight
down
on
the
ancient
port
with
its
old
houses
and
fine
multiform
red
roofs
through
the
gauze
of
blue
smoke
which
at
eve
of
a
summer
day
fills
the
narrow
valley
softening
the
rough
of
life
into
harmony
with
the
gentleness
of
sea
and
shore
field
and
sky
no
doubt
the
suburbs
are
as
unsightly
as
mere
boxes
of
brick
and
lime
can
be
with
an
ugliness
mean
because
pretentious
an
altogether
modern
ugliness
but
even
this
can
not
touch
the
essential
beauty
of
the
place
on
the
brow
of
this
east
hill
just
where
it
begins
to
sink
towards
ecclesbourne
glen
stands
a
small
old
rickety
house
in
the
midst
of
the
sweet
grass
of
the
downs
this
house
my
husband
was
fortunate
in
finding
to
let
and
took
for
three
months
i
am
not
however
going
to
give
any
history
of
how
we
spent
them
my
sole
reason
for
mentioning
hastings
at
all
being
that
there
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
cromwell
it
was
on
this
wise
one
bright
day
about
noon
almost
all
the
days
of
those
months
were
gorgeous
with
sunlight
a
rather
fashionable
maid
ran
up
our
little
garden
begging
for
some
water
for
her
mistress
sending
her
on
with
the
water
i
followed
myself
with
a
glass
of
sherry
the
door
in
our
opened
immediately
on
a
green
hollow
in
the
hill
sloping
towards
the
glen
as
i
stepped
from
the
little
gate
on
to
the
grass
i
saw
to
my
surprise
that
a
white
fog
was
blowing
in
from
the
sea
the
heights
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
glen
partially
obscured
thereby
looked
more
majestic
than
was
their
wont
and
were
mottled
with
patches
of
duller
and
brighter
color
as
the
drifts
of
the
fog
were
heaped
or
parted
here
and
there
far
down
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
the
waves
of
the
rising
tide
driven
with
the
added
force
of
a
breeze
caught
and
threw
back
what
sunlight
reached
them
and
thinned
with
their
shine
the
fog
between
it
was
all
so
strange
and
fine
and
had
come
on
so
suddenly
for
when
i
had
looked
out
a
few
minutes
before
sea
and
sky
were
purely
resplendent
that
i
stood
a
moment
or
two
and
gazed
almost
forgetting
why
i
was
there
when
i
bethought
myself
and
looked
about
me
i
saw
in
the
sheltered
hollow
before
me
a
lady
seated
in
a
chair
so
constructed
in
fact
as
to
form
upon
occasion
a
kind
of
litter
it
was
plain
she
was
an
invalid
from
her
paleness
and
the
tension
of
the
skin
on
her
face
revealing
the
outline
of
the
bones
beneath
her
features
were
finely
formed
but
rather
small
and
her
forehead
low
a
face
with
large
eyes
that
reminded
me
of
little
amy
morley
she
smiled
very
sweetly
when
she
saw
me
and
shook
her
head
at
the
wine
i
only
wanted
a
little
water
she
said
this
fog
seems
to
stifle
me
it
has
come
on
very
suddenly
i
said
perhaps
it
is
the
cold
of
it
that
affects
your
breathing
you
do
seem
very
strong
and
any
sudden
change
of
temperature
i
am
not
one
of
the
most
vigorous
of
mortals
she
answered
with
a
sad
smile
but
the
day
seemed
of
such
indubitable
character
that
after
my
husband
had
brought
me
here
in
the
carriage
he
sent
it
home
and
left
me
with
my
maid
while
he
went
for
a
long
walk
across
the
downs
when
he
sees
the
change
in
the
weather
though
he
will
turn
directly
it
wo
do
to
wait
him
here
i
said
we
must
get
you
in
at
once
would
it
be
wrong
to
press
you
to
take
a
little
of
this
wine
just
to
counteract
a
chill
i
dare
touch
any
thing
but
water
she
replied
it
would
make
me
feverish
at
once
run
and
tell
the
cook
i
said
to
the
maid
that
i
want
her
here
you
and
she
could
carry
your
mistress
in
could
you
not
i
will
help
you
there
no
occasion
for
that
she
as
light
as
a
feather
was
the
whispered
answer
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
giving
you
so
much
trouble
said
the
lady
either
hearing
or
guessing
at
our
words
my
husband
will
be
very
grateful
to
you
it
is
only
an
act
of
common
humanity
i
said
but
as
i
spoke
i
fancied
her
fair
brow
clouded
a
little
as
if
she
was
not
accustomed
to
common
humanity
and
the
word
sounded
harsh
in
her
ear
the
cloud
however
passed
so
quickly
that
i
doubted
until
i
knew
her
better
whether
it
had
really
been
there
the
two
maids
were
now
ready
and
jemima
instructed
by
the
other
they
lifted
her
with
the
utmost
ease
and
bore
her
gently
towards
the
house
the
was
just
wide
enough
to
let
the
chair
through
and
in
a
minute
more
she
was
upon
the
sofa
then
a
fit
of
coughing
came
on
which
shook
her
dreadfully
when
it
had
passed
she
lay
quiet
with
closed
eyes
and
a
smile
hovering
about
her
sweet
mouth
by
and
by
she
opened
them
and
looked
at
me
with
a
pitiful
expression
i
fear
you
are
far
from
well
i
said
i
dying
she
returned
quietly
i
hope
not
was
all
i
could
answer
why
should
you
hope
not
she
returned
i
am
in
no
strait
betwixt
two
i
desire
to
depart
for
me
to
die
will
be
all
gain
but
your
friends
i
ventured
to
suggest
feeling
my
way
and
not
quite
relishing
either
the
form
or
tone
of
her
utterance
i
have
none
but
my
husband
then
your
husband
i
persisted
ah
she
said
mournfully
he
will
miss
me
no
doubt
for
a
while
but
it
be
a
weight
off
him
for
i
have
been
a
sufferer
so
long
at
this
moment
i
heard
a
heavy
hasty
step
in
the
passage
the
next
the
room
door
opened
and
in
came
in
hot
haste
wiping
his
red
face
a
burly
man
clumsy
and
active
with
an
umbrella
in
his
hand
followed
by
a
great
lumbering
newfoundland
dog
down
polyphemus
he
said
to
the
dog
which
crept
under
a
chair
while
he
taking
no
notice
of
my
presence
hurried
up
to
his
wife
my
love
my
little
dove
he
said
eagerly
did
you
think
i
had
forsaken
you
to
the
cruel
elements
no
alcibiades
she
answered
with
a
sweet
little
drawl
but
you
do
not
observe
that
i
am
not
the
only
lady
in
the
room
then
turning
to
me
this
is
my
husband
cromwell
she
said
i
can
not
tell
him
name
i
am
percivale
i
returned
almost
mechanically
for
the
two
names
had
run
together
and
were
sounding
in
my
head
how
could
such
a
conjunction
have
taken
place
without
the
intervention
of
charles
dickens
i
beg
your
pardon
said
cromwell
bowing
permit
my
anxiety
about
my
poor
wife
to
cover
my
rudeness
i
had
climbed
the
other
side
of
the
glen
before
i
saw
the
fog
and
it
is
no
such
easy
matter
to
get
up
and
down
these
hills
of
yours
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
your
hospitality
you
have
doubtless
saved
her
life
for
she
is
a
frail
flower
shrinking
from
the
least
breath
of
cold
the
lady
closed
her
eyes
again
and
the
gentleman
took
her
hand
and
felt
her
pulse
he
seemed
about
twice
her
age
she
not
thirty
he
well
past
fifty
the
top
of
his
head
bald
and
his
gray
hair
sticking
out
fiercely
over
his
red
cheeks
he
laid
her
hand
gently
down
put
his
hat
on
the
table
and
his
umbrella
in
a
corner
wiped
his
face
again
drew
a
chair
near
the
sofa
and
took
his
place
by
her
side
i
thought
it
better
to
leave
them
when
i
after
a
while
i
saw
from
the
windows
which
looked
that
the
wind
had
risen
and
was
driving
thin
drifts
no
longer
but
great
thick
white
masses
of
landwards
it
was
the
of
that
coast
the
which
dashes
the
pebbles
over
the
parade
and
the
heavy
spray
against
the
houses
alcibiades
cromwell
was
sitting
as
i
had
left
him
silent
by
the
side
of
his
wife
whose
eyelids
had
apparently
never
been
lifted
from
her
large
eyes
is
there
any
thing
i
could
offer
mrs
cromwell
i
said
could
she
not
eat
something
it
is
very
little
she
can
take
he
answered
but
you
are
very
kind
if
you
could
let
her
have
a
little
she
generally
has
a
spoonful
or
two
about
this
time
of
the
day
i
am
sorry
we
have
none
i
said
and
it
would
be
far
too
long
for
her
to
wait
i
have
a
nice
chicken
though
ready
for
cooking
if
she
could
take
a
little
that
would
be
ready
in
a
very
little
while
thank
you
a
thousand
times
he
said
heartily
nothing
could
be
better
she
might
even
be
induced
to
eat
a
mouthful
of
the
chicken
but
i
am
afraid
your
extreme
kindness
prevents
me
from
being
so
thoroughly
ashamed
as
i
ought
to
be
at
putting
you
to
so
much
trouble
for
perfect
strangers
it
is
but
a
pleasure
to
be
of
service
to
any
one
in
want
of
it
i
said
cromwell
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
gratefully
i
left
the
room
to
give
orders
about
the
chicken
indeed
to
superintend
the
preparation
of
it
myself
for
jemima
could
not
be
altogether
trusted
in
such
a
delicate
affair
as
cooking
for
an
invalid
when
i
returned
having
set
the
simple
operation
going
cromwell
had
a
little
of
mine
he
had
found
on
the
table
open
in
his
hand
and
his
wife
was
saying
to
him
that
is
lovely
thank
you
husband
how
can
it
be
i
never
saw
it
before
i
am
quite
astonished
she
little
knows
what
multitudes
of
hymns
there
are
i
thought
with
myself
my
father
having
made
a
collection
whence
i
had
some
idea
of
the
extent
of
that
department
of
religious
literature
this
is
a
we
are
not
acquainted
with
said
cromwell
addressing
me
it
is
not
much
known
i
answered
it
was
compiled
by
a
friend
of
my
father
for
his
own
schools
and
this
he
went
on
is
a
very
beautiful
hymn
you
may
trust
my
judgment
percivale
she
lives
upon
hymns
he
read
the
first
line
to
show
which
he
meant
i
had
long
thought
and
still
think
it
the
most
beautiful
hymn
i
know
it
was
taken
from
the
german
only
much
improved
in
the
taking
and
given
to
my
father
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
and
my
father
had
given
it
to
another
friend
for
his
collection
before
that
however
while
still
in
manuscript
it
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
certain
clergyman
by
whom
it
had
been
published
without
leave
asked
or
apology
made
a
rudeness
of
which
neither
my
father
nor
the
author
would
have
complained
for
it
was
a
pleasure
to
think
it
might
thus
reach
many
to
whom
it
would
be
helpful
but
they
both
felt
aggrieved
and
indignant
that
he
had
taken
the
dishonest
liberty
of
altering
certain
lines
of
it
to
suit
his
own
opinions
as
i
am
anxious
to
give
it
all
the
publicity
i
can
from
pure
delight
in
it
and
love
to
all
who
are
capable
of
the
same
delight
i
shall
here
communicate
it
in
the
full
confidence
of
thus
establishing
a
claim
on
the
gratitude
of
my
readers
o
lord
how
happy
is
the
time
when
in
thy
love
i
rest
when
from
my
weariness
i
climb
even
to
thy
tender
breast
the
night
of
sorrow
endeth
there
thou
art
brighter
than
the
sun
and
in
thy
pardon
and
thy
care
the
heaven
of
heaven
is
won
let
the
world
call
herself
my
foe
or
let
the
world
allure
i
care
not
for
the
world
i
go
to
this
dear
friend
and
sure
and
when
life
fiercest
storms
are
sent
upon
life
wildest
sea
my
little
bark
is
confident
because
it
holds
by
thee
when
the
law
threatens
endless
death
upon
the
awful
hill
straightway
from
her
consuming
breath
my
soul
goes
higher
still
goeth
to
jesus
wounded
slain
and
maketh
him
her
home
whence
she
will
not
go
out
again
and
where
death
can
not
come
i
do
not
fear
the
wilderness
where
thou
hast
been
before
nay
rather
will
i
daily
press
after
thee
near
thee
more
thou
art
my
food
on
thee
i
lean
thou
makest
my
heart
sing
and
to
thy
heavenly
pastures
green
all
thy
dear
flock
dost
bring
and
if
the
gate
that
opens
there
be
dark
to
other
men
it
is
not
dark
to
those
who
share
the
heart
of
jesus
then
that
is
not
losing
much
of
life
which
is
not
losing
thee
who
art
as
present
in
the
strife
as
in
the
victory
therefore
how
happy
is
the
time
when
in
thy
love
i
rest
when
from
my
weariness
i
climb
even
to
thy
tender
breast
the
night
of
sorrow
endeth
there
thou
are
brighter
than
the
sun
and
in
thy
pardon
and
thy
care
the
heaven
of
heaven
is
won
in
telling
them
a
few
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
hymn
i
presume
i
had
manifested
my
admiration
of
it
with
some
degree
of
fervor
ah
said
cromwell
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
and
letting
the
rising
tears
fill
them
ah
percivale
you
are
you
must
be
one
of
us
you
must
tell
me
first
who
you
are
i
said
she
held
out
her
hand
i
gave
her
mine
she
drew
me
towards
her
and
whispered
almost
in
my
ear
though
why
or
whence
the
affectation
of
secrecy
i
can
only
imagine
the
name
of
a
certain
small
and
exclusive
sect
i
will
not
indicate
it
lest
i
should
be
supposed
to
attribute
to
it
either
the
peculiar
faults
or
virtues
of
my
new
acquaintance
no
i
answered
speaking
with
the
calmness
of
for
i
confess
i
felt
repelled
i
am
not
one
of
you
except
in
as
far
as
we
all
belong
to
the
church
of
christ
i
have
thought
since
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
to
say
yes
for
we
all
belong
to
the
church
of
christ
she
gave
a
little
sigh
of
disappointment
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
opened
them
again
with
a
smile
and
said
with
a
pleading
tone
but
you
do
believe
in
personal
religion
i
do
see
i
returned
how
religion
can
be
any
thing
but
personal
again
she
closed
her
eyes
in
a
way
that
made
me
think
how
convenient
bad
health
must
be
conferring
not
only
the
privilege
of
passing
into
retirement
at
any
desirable
moment
but
of
doing
so
in
such
a
ready
and
easy
manner
as
the
mere
dropping
of
the
eyelids
i
rose
to
leave
the
room
once
more
cromwell
who
had
made
way
for
me
to
sit
beside
his
wife
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
against
which
came
sweeping
the
great
volumes
of
mist
i
glanced
out
also
not
only
was
the
sea
invisible
but
even
the
brow
of
the
cliffs
when
he
turned
towards
me
as
i
passed
him
i
saw
that
his
face
had
lost
much
of
its
rubicund
hue
and
looked
troubled
and
anxious
there
is
nothing
for
it
i
said
to
myself
but
keep
them
all
night
and
so
gave
directions
to
have
a
bedroom
prepared
for
them
i
did
not
much
like
it
i
confess
for
i
was
not
much
interested
in
either
of
them
while
of
the
sect
to
which
she
belonged
i
knew
enough
already
to
be
aware
that
it
was
of
the
narrowest
and
most
sectarian
in
christendom
it
was
a
pity
she
had
sought
to
claim
me
by
a
closer
bond
than
that
of
the
body
of
christ
still
i
knew
i
should
be
myself
a
sectary
if
i
therefore
excluded
her
from
my
best
sympathies
at
the
same
time
i
did
feel
some
curiosity
concerning
the
couple
and
wondered
whether
the
lady
was
really
so
ill
as
she
would
appear
i
doubted
whether
she
might
not
be
using
her
illness
both
as
an
excuse
for
and
as
a
means
of
keeping
her
husband
interest
in
her
on
the
stretch
i
did
not
like
the
wearing
of
her
religion
on
her
sleeve
nor
the
mellifluous
drawl
in
which
she
spoke
when
the
was
ready
she
partook
daintily
but
before
she
ended
had
made
a
very
good
meal
including
a
wing
and
a
bit
of
the
breast
after
which
she
fell
asleep
there
seems
little
chance
of
the
weather
clearing
said
cromwell
in
a
whisper
as
i
approached
the
window
where
he
once
more
stood
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
remain
here
for
the
night
i
said
my
dear
madam
i
could
think
of
it
he
returned
i
thought
from
unwillingness
to
incommode
a
strange
household
an
invalid
like
her
sweet
lamb
he
went
on
requires
so
many
little
comforts
and
peculiar
contrivances
to
entice
the
repose
she
so
greatly
needs
that
that
in
short
i
must
get
her
home
where
do
you
live
i
asked
not
sorry
to
find
his
intention
of
going
so
fixed
we
have
a
house
in
warrior
square
he
answered
we
live
in
london
but
have
been
here
all
the
past
winter
i
doubt
if
she
improves
though
i
doubt
i
doubt
he
said
the
last
words
in
a
yet
lower
and
more
mournful
whisper
then
with
a
shake
of
his
head
turned
and
gazed
again
through
the
window
a
peculiar
little
cough
from
the
sofa
made
us
both
look
round
cromwell
was
awake
and
searching
for
her
handkerchief
her
husband
understood
her
movements
and
hurried
to
her
assistance
when
she
took
the
handkerchief
from
her
mouth
there
was
a
red
spot
upon
it
face
turned
the
color
of
lead
but
his
wife
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
a
sweet
consciously
pathetic
smile
he
has
sent
for
me
she
said
the
messenger
has
come
her
husband
made
no
answer
his
eyes
seemed
starting
from
his
head
who
is
your
medical
man
i
asked
him
he
told
me
and
i
sent
off
my
housemaid
to
fetch
him
it
was
a
long
hour
before
he
arrived
during
which
as
often
as
i
peeped
in
i
saw
him
sitting
silent
and
holding
her
hand
until
the
last
time
when
i
found
him
reading
a
hymn
to
her
she
was
apparently
once
more
asleep
nothing
could
be
more
favorable
to
her
recovery
than
such
quietness
of
both
body
and
mind
when
the
doctor
came
and
had
listened
to
cromwell
statement
he
proceeded
to
examine
her
chest
with
much
care
that
over
he
averred
in
her
hearing
that
he
found
nothing
serious
but
told
her
husband
apart
that
there
was
considerable
mischief
and
assured
me
afterwards
that
her
lungs
were
all
but
gone
and
that
she
could
not
live
beyond
a
month
or
two
she
had
better
be
removed
to
her
own
house
he
said
as
speedily
as
possible
but
it
would
be
cruelty
to
send
her
out
a
day
like
this
i
returned
yes
yes
i
did
not
mean
that
he
said
but
perhaps
see
what
the
weather
is
like
is
cromwell
an
old
friend
i
never
saw
her
until
i
replied
ah
he
remarked
and
said
no
more
we
got
her
to
bed
as
soon
as
possible
i
may
just
mention
that
i
never
saw
any
thing
to
equal
the
of
her
underclothing
there
was
not
a
stitch
of
cotton
about
her
using
the
word
in
its
metaphorical
sense
but
indeed
i
doubt
whether
her
garments
were
not
all
made
with
linen
thread
even
her
petticoat
was
quilted
with
silk
inside
surely
she
has
no
children
i
said
to
myself
and
was
right
as
my
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
it
was
a
week
before
she
got
up
again
and
a
month
before
she
was
carried
down
the
hill
during
which
time
her
husband
sat
up
with
her
or
slept
on
a
sofa
in
the
room
beside
her
every
night
during
the
day
i
took
a
share
in
the
nursing
which
was
by
no
means
oppressive
for
she
did
not
suffer
much
and
required
little
her
chief
demand
was
for
hymns
the
only
annoyance
connected
with
which
worth
mentioning
was
that
she
often
wished
me
to
admire
with
her
such
as
i
could
only
half
like
and
occasionally
such
as
were
thoroughly
distasteful
to
me
her
husband
had
brought
her
own
collection
from
warrior
square
volumes
of
hymns
in
manuscript
copied
by
her
own
hand
many
of
them
strange
to
me
none
of
those
i
read
altogether
devoid
of
literary
merit
and
some
of
them
lovely
both
in
feeling
and
form
but
all
even
the
best
which
to
me
were
unobjectionable
belonged
to
one
class
a
class
breathing
a
certain
tone
difficult
to
describe
one
however
which
i
find
characteristic
of
all
the
roman
catholic
hymns
i
have
read
i
will
not
indicate
any
of
her
selection
neither
lest
i
should
be
supposed
to
object
to
this
or
that
one
answering
to
the
general
description
and
yet
worthy
of
all
respect
or
even
sympathy
will
i
go
further
with
a
specification
of
their
sort
than
to
say
that
what
pleased
me
in
them
was
their
full
utterance
of
personal
devotion
to
the
saviour
and
that
what
displeased
me
was
a
sort
of
sentimental
regard
of
self
in
the
matter
an
implied
special
and
thus
partially
exclusive
predilection
or
preference
of
the
saviour
for
the
individual
supposed
to
be
making
use
of
them
a
certain
fundamental
want
of
humility
therefore
although
the
forms
of
speech
in
which
they
were
cast
might
be
laboriously
humble
they
also
not
unfrequently
manifested
a
great
leaning
to
the
forms
of
earthly
show
as
representative
of
the
glories
of
that
kingdom
which
the
lord
says
is
likewise
the
manner
in
which
cromwell
talked
reminded
me
much
of
the
way
in
which
a
nun
would
represent
her
individual
relation
to
christ
i
can
best
show
what
i
mean
by
giving
a
conversation
i
had
with
her
one
day
when
she
was
recovering
which
she
did
with
wonderful
rapidity
up
to
a
certain
point
i
confess
i
shrink
a
little
from
reproducing
it
because
of
the
sacred
name
which
as
it
seemed
to
me
was
far
too
often
upon
her
lips
and
too
easily
uttered
but
then
she
was
made
so
different
from
me
the
fine
weather
had
returned
in
all
its
summer
glory
and
she
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
her
own
room
near
the
window
whence
she
could
gaze
on
the
expanse
of
sea
below
this
morning
streaked
with
the
most
delicate
gradations
of
distance
sweep
beyond
sweep
line
and
band
and
ribbon
of
softly
often
but
slightly
varied
hue
leading
the
eyes
on
and
on
into
the
infinite
there
may
have
been
some
atmospheric
illusion
ending
off
the
show
for
the
last
reaches
mingled
so
with
the
air
that
you
saw
no
horizon
line
only
a
great
breadth
of
border
no
spot
which
could
you
appropriate
with
certainty
either
to
sea
or
sky
while
here
and
there
was
a
vessel
to
all
appearance
pursuing
its
path
in
the
sky
and
not
upon
the
sea
it
was
as
some
of
my
readers
will
not
require
to
be
told
a
still
gray
forenoon
with
a
film
of
cloud
over
all
the
heavens
and
many
horizontal
strata
of
deeper
but
varying
density
near
the
horizon
cromwell
had
lain
for
some
time
with
her
large
eyes
fixed
on
the
farthest
confusion
of
sea
and
sky
i
have
been
sending
out
my
soul
she
said
at
length
to
travel
all
across
those
distances
step
by
step
on
to
the
gates
of
pearl
who
knows
but
that
may
be
the
path
i
must
travel
to
meet
the
bridegroom
the
way
is
wide
i
said
what
if
you
should
miss
him
i
spoke
almost
involuntarily
the
style
of
her
talk
was
very
distasteful
to
me
and
i
had
just
been
thinking
of
what
i
had
once
heard
my
father
say
that
at
no
time
were
people
in
more
danger
of
being
theatrical
than
when
upon
their
no
she
returned
with
a
smile
of
gentle
superiority
no
that
can
not
be
is
he
not
waiting
for
me
has
he
not
chosen
me
and
called
me
for
his
own
is
not
my
jesus
mine
i
shall
miss
him
he
waits
to
give
me
my
new
name
and
clothe
me
in
the
garments
of
righteousness
as
she
spoke
she
clasped
her
thin
hands
and
looked
upwards
with
a
radiant
expression
far
as
it
was
from
me
to
hint
even
in
my
own
soul
that
the
saviour
was
not
hers
tenfold
more
hers
than
she
was
able
to
think
i
could
not
at
the
same
time
but
doubt
whether
her
heart
and
soul
and
mind
were
as
close
to
him
as
her
words
would
indicate
she
thought
they
were
she
could
not
be
wrong
in
trusting
him
but
could
she
be
right
in
her
notion
of
the
measure
to
which
her
union
with
him
had
been
perfected
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
a
little
fear
soon
to
pass
into
reverence
might
be
to
her
a
salutary
thing
the
fear
i
thought
would
heighten
and
deepen
the
love
and
purify
it
from
that
self
which
haunted
her
whole
consciousness
and
of
which
she
had
not
yet
sickened
as
one
day
she
certainly
must
my
lamp
is
burning
she
said
i
feel
it
burning
i
love
my
lord
it
would
be
false
to
say
otherwise
are
you
sure
you
have
oil
enough
in
your
vessel
as
well
as
in
your
lamp
i
said
ah
you
are
one
of
the
doubting
she
returned
kindly
do
you
know
that
sweet
hymn
about
feeding
our
lamps
from
the
of
gethsemane
the
idea
is
taken
from
the
lamp
the
prophet
zechariah
saw
in
his
vision
into
which
two
through
two
golden
pipes
emptied
the
golden
oil
out
of
themselves
if
we
are
thus
one
with
the
the
oil
can
not
fail
us
it
is
not
as
if
we
had
to
fill
our
lamps
from
a
cruse
of
our
own
this
is
the
cruse
that
can
not
fail
true
true
i
said
but
ought
we
not
to
examine
our
own
selves
whether
we
are
in
the
faith
let
those
examine
that
doubt
she
replied
and
i
could
not
but
yield
in
my
heart
that
she
had
had
the
best
of
the
argument
for
i
knew
that
the
confidence
in
christ
which
prevents
us
from
thinking
of
ourselves
and
makes
us
eager
to
obey
his
word
leaving
all
the
care
of
our
feelings
to
him
is
a
true
and
healthy
faith
hence
i
could
not
answer
her
although
i
doubted
whether
her
peace
came
from
such
confidence
doubted
for
several
reasons
one
that
so
far
from
not
thinking
of
herself
she
seemed
full
of
herself
another
that
she
seemed
to
find
no
difficulty
with
herself
in
any
way
and
surely
she
was
too
young
for
all
struggle
to
be
over
i
perceived
no
reference
to
the
will
of
god
in
regard
of
any
thing
she
had
to
do
only
in
regard
of
what
she
had
to
suffer
and
especially
in
regard
of
that
smallest
of
matters
when
she
was
to
go
here
i
checked
myself
for
what
could
she
in
such
a
state
of
health
but
then
she
never
spoke
as
if
she
had
any
anxiety
about
the
welfare
of
other
people
that
however
might
be
from
her
absolute
contentment
in
the
will
of
god
but
why
did
she
always
look
to
the
saviour
through
a
mist
of
hymns
and
never
go
straight
back
to
the
genuine
old
good
news
or
to
the
mighty
thoughts
and
exhortations
with
which
the
first
preachers
of
that
news
followed
them
up
and
unfolded
the
grandeur
of
their
goodness
after
all
was
i
not
judging
her
on
the
other
hand
ought
i
not
to
care
for
her
state
should
i
not
be
inhuman
that
is
unchristian
if
i
did
not
in
the
end
i
saw
clearly
enough
that
except
it
was
revealed
to
me
what
i
ought
to
say
i
had
no
right
to
say
any
thing
and
that
to
be
uneasy
about
her
was
to
distrust
him
whose
it
was
to
teach
her
and
who
would
perfect
that
which
he
had
certainly
begun
in
her
for
her
heart
however
poor
and
faulty
and
flimsy
its
faith
might
be
was
yet
certainly
drawn
towards
the
object
of
faith
i
therefore
said
nothing
more
in
the
direction
of
opening
her
eyes
to
what
i
considered
her
condition
that
view
of
it
might
after
all
be
but
a
phantasm
of
my
own
projection
what
was
plainly
my
duty
was
to
serve
her
as
one
of
those
the
least
of
whom
the
saviour
sets
forth
as
representing
himself
i
would
do
it
to
her
as
unto
him
my
children
were
out
the
greater
part
of
every
day
and
dora
was
with
me
so
that
i
had
more
leisure
than
i
had
had
for
a
long
time
i
therefore
set
myself
to
wait
upon
her
as
a
kind
of
lady
maid
in
things
spiritual
her
own
maid
understanding
her
ways
was
sufficient
for
things
temporal
i
resolved
to
try
to
help
her
after
her
own
fashion
and
not
after
mine
for
however
strange
the
nourishment
she
preferred
might
seem
it
must
at
least
be
of
the
she
could
best
assimilate
my
care
should
be
to
give
her
her
gruel
as
good
as
i
might
and
her
strong
with
instead
of
and
delusive
jelly
but
much
opportunity
of
ministration
was
not
afforded
me
for
her
husband
whose
business
in
life
she
seemed
to
regard
as
the
care
of
her
for
which
in
truth
she
was
gently
and
lovingly
grateful
and
who
not
merely
accepted
her
view
of
the
matter
but
i
was
pretty
sure
had
had
a
large
share
in
originating
it
was
even
more
constant
in
his
attentions
than
she
found
altogether
agreeable
to
judge
by
the
way
in
which
she
would
insist
on
his
going
out
for
a
second
walk
when
it
was
clear
that
besides
his
desire
to
be
with
her
he
was
not
inclined
to
walk
any
more
i
could
set
myself
however
as
i
have
indicated
to
find
fitting
pabulum
for
her
and
that
of
her
chosen
sort
this
was
possible
for
me
in
virtue
of
my
father
collection
of
hymns
and
the
aid
he
could
give
me
i
therefore
sent
him
a
detailed
description
of
what
seemed
to
me
her
condition
and
what
i
thought
i
might
do
for
her
it
was
a
week
before
he
gave
me
an
answer
but
it
arrived
a
thorough
one
in
the
shape
of
a
box
of
books
each
bristling
with
paper
marks
many
of
them
inscribed
with
some
fact
concerning
or
criticism
upon
the
hymn
indicated
he
wrote
that
he
quite
agreed
with
my
notion
of
the
right
mode
of
serving
her
for
any
other
would
be
as
if
a
besieging
party
were
to
batter
a
postern
by
means
of
boats
instead
of
walking
over
a
lowered
drawbridge
and
under
a
raised
portcullis
having
taken
a
survey
of
the
hymns
my
father
thus
pointed
out
to
me
and
arranged
them
according
to
their
degrees
of
approximation
to
the
weakest
of
those
in
cromwell
collection
i
judged
that
in
all
of
them
there
was
something
she
must
appreciate
although
the
main
drift
of
several
would
be
entirely
beyond
her
apprehension
even
these
however
it
would
be
well
to
try
upon
her
accordingly
the
next
time
she
asked
me
to
read
from
her
collection
i
made
the
request
that
she
would
listen
to
some
which
i
believed
she
did
not
know
but
would
i
thought
like
she
consented
with
eagerness
was
astonished
to
find
she
knew
none
of
them
expressed
much
approbation
of
some
and
showed
herself
delighted
with
others
that
she
must
have
had
some
literary
faculty
seems
evident
from
the
genuine
pleasure
she
took
in
simple
quaint
sometimes
even
odd
hymns
of
her
own
peculiar
kind
but
the
very
best
of
another
sort
she
could
not
appreciate
for
instance
the
following
by
john
mason
in
my
father
opinion
one
of
the
best
had
no
attraction
for
her
thou
wast
o
god
and
thou
was
blest
before
the
world
begun
of
thine
eternity
possest
before
time
glass
did
run
thou
needest
none
thy
praise
to
sing
as
if
thy
joy
could
fade
couldst
thou
have
needed
any
thing
thou
couldst
have
nothing
made
great
and
good
god
it
pleaseth
thee
thy
godhead
to
declare
and
what
thy
goodness
did
decree
thy
greatness
did
prepare
thou
and
heaven
and
earth
appeared
and
answered
to
thy
call
as
if
their
maker
voice
they
heard
which
is
the
creature
all
thou
the
word
most
mighty
lord
thy
word
went
forth
with
speed
thy
will
o
lord
it
was
thy
word
thy
word
it
was
thy
deed
thou
forth
adam
from
the
ground
and
eve
out
of
his
side
thy
blessing
made
the
earth
abound
with
these
two
multiplied
those
three
great
leaves
heaven
sea
and
land
thy
name
in
figures
show
brutes
feel
the
bounty
of
thy
hand
but
i
my
maker
know
should
not
i
here
thy
servant
be
whose
creatures
serve
me
here
my
lord
whom
should
i
fear
but
thee
who
am
thy
creatures
fear
to
whom
lord
should
i
sing
but
thee
the
maker
of
my
tongue
lo
other
lords
would
seize
on
me
but
i
to
thee
belong
as
waters
haste
unto
their
sea
and
earth
unto
its
earth
so
let
my
soul
return
to
thee
from
whom
it
had
its
birth
but
ah
i
fallen
in
the
night
and
can
not
come
to
thee
yet
speak
the
word
there
be
it
shall
enlighten
me
and
let
thy
word
most
mighty
lord
thy
fallen
creature
raise
oh
make
me
again
and
i
shall
sing
my
maker
praise
this
and
others
i
say
she
could
not
relish
but
my
endeavors
were
crowned
with
success
in
so
far
that
she
accepted
better
specimens
of
the
sort
she
liked
than
any
she
had
and
i
think
they
must
have
had
a
good
influence
upon
her
she
seemed
to
have
no
fear
of
death
contemplating
the
change
she
believed
at
hand
not
with
equanimity
merely
but
with
expectation
she
even
wrote
hymns
about
it
sweet
pretty
and
weak
always
with
herself
and
the
love
of
her
saviour
for
in
the
foreground
she
had
not
learned
that
the
love
which
lays
hold
of
that
which
is
human
in
the
individual
that
is
which
is
common
to
the
whole
race
must
be
an
infinitely
deeper
tenderer
and
more
precious
thing
to
the
individual
than
any
affection
manifesting
itself
in
the
preference
of
one
over
another
for
the
sake
of
revealing
her
modes
of
thought
i
will
give
one
more
specimen
of
my
conversations
with
her
ere
i
pass
on
it
took
place
the
evening
before
her
departure
for
her
own
house
her
husband
had
gone
to
make
some
final
preparations
of
which
there
had
been
many
for
one
who
expected
to
be
unclothed
that
she
might
be
clothed
upon
she
certainly
made
a
tolerable
about
the
garment
she
was
so
soon
to
lay
aside
especially
seeing
she
often
spoke
of
it
as
an
garment
never
with
peevishness
or
complaint
only
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
far
more
interest
than
it
was
worth
she
had
even
as
afterwards
appeared
given
her
husband
good
honest
man
full
instructions
as
to
the
ceremonial
of
its
interment
perhaps
i
should
have
been
considerably
less
bewildered
with
her
conduct
had
i
suspected
that
she
was
not
half
so
near
death
as
she
chose
to
think
and
that
she
had
as
yet
suffered
little
that
evening
the
stars
just
beginning
to
glimmer
through
the
warm
flush
that
lingered
from
the
sunset
we
sat
together
in
the
looking
out
on
the
sea
my
patient
appearing
from
the
light
in
her
eyes
about
to
go
off
into
one
of
her
ecstatic
moods
i
hastened
to
forestall
it
if
i
might
with
whatever
came
uppermost
for
i
felt
my
inability
to
sympathize
with
her
in
these
more
of
a
pain
than
my
reader
will
perhaps
readily
imagine
it
seems
like
turning
you
out
to
let
you
go
cromwell
i
said
but
you
see
our
three
months
are
up
two
days
after
and
i
can
not
help
it
you
have
been
very
kind
she
said
half
abstractedly
and
you
are
really
much
better
who
would
have
thought
three
weeks
ago
to
see
you
so
well
ah
you
congratulate
me
do
you
she
rejoined
turning
her
big
eyes
full
upon
me
congratulate
me
that
i
am
doomed
to
be
still
a
captive
in
the
prison
of
this
vile
body
is
it
kind
is
it
well
at
least
you
must
remember
if
you
are
who
dooms
you
that
i
had
the
wings
of
a
dove
she
cried
avoiding
my
remark
of
which
i
doubt
if
she
saw
the
drift
think
dear
percivale
the
society
of
saints
and
angels
all
brightness
and
harmony
and
peace
is
it
not
worth
forsaking
this
world
to
inherit
a
kingdom
like
that
like
to
go
do
wish
to
fly
away
and
be
at
rest
she
spoke
as
if
expostulating
and
reasoning
with
one
she
would
persuade
to
some
kind
of
holy
emigration
not
until
i
am
sent
for
i
answered
i
sent
for
she
returned
wave
may
be
cold
and
the
tide
may
be
strong
but
hark
on
the
shore
the
angels
glad
song
do
you
know
that
sweet
hymn
percivale
there
i
shall
be
able
to
love
him
aright
to
serve
him
aright
all
my
labor
is
so
poor
here
all
my
love
so
faint
but
when
i
reach
the
heavenly
door
i
cease
the
weary
plaint
i
could
help
wishing
she
would
cease
it
a
little
sooner
but
suppose
i
ventured
to
say
it
were
the
will
of
god
that
you
should
live
many
years
yet
that
can
not
be
and
why
should
you
wish
it
for
me
is
it
not
better
to
depart
and
be
with
him
what
pleasure
could
it
be
to
a
weak
worn
creature
like
me
to
go
on
living
in
this
isle
of
banishment
but
suppose
you
were
to
recover
your
health
would
it
not
be
delightful
to
something
for
his
sake
if
you
would
think
of
how
much
there
is
to
be
done
in
the
world
perhaps
you
would
wish
less
to
die
and
leave
it
do
not
tempt
me
she
returned
reproachfully
and
then
she
quoted
a
passage
the
application
of
which
to
her
own
case
appeared
to
me
so
irreverent
that
i
confess
i
felt
like
abraham
with
the
idolater
so
far
at
least
as
to
wish
her
out
of
the
house
for
i
could
bear
with
her
i
thought
no
longer
she
did
leave
it
the
next
day
and
i
breathed
more
freely
than
since
she
had
entered
it
my
husband
came
down
to
fetch
me
the
following
day
and
a
walk
with
him
along
the
cliffs
in
the
gathering
twilight
during
which
i
recounted
the
affectations
of
my
late
visitor
completely
wiped
the
cobwebs
from
my
mental
windows
and
enabled
me
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
cromwell
was
but
a
spoiled
child
who
would
somehow
or
other
be
brought
to
her
senses
before
all
was
over
i
was
ashamed
of
my
impatience
with
her
and
believed
if
i
could
have
learned
her
history
of
which
she
had
told
me
nothing
it
would
have
explained
the
rare
phenomenon
of
one
apparently
able
to
look
death
in
the
face
with
so
little
of
the
really
spiritual
to
support
her
for
she
seemed
to
me
to
know
christ
only
after
the
flesh
but
had
she
indeed
ever
looked
death
in
the
face
chapter
xxxviii
cromwell
goes
i
heard
nothing
more
of
her
for
about
a
year
a
note
or
two
passed
between
us
and
then
all
communication
ceased
this
i
am
happy
to
think
was
not
immediately
my
fault
not
that
it
mattered
much
for
we
were
not
then
fitted
for
much
communion
we
had
too
little
in
common
to
commune
did
you
not
both
believe
in
one
lord
i
fancy
a
reader
objecting
how
then
can
you
say
you
had
too
little
in
common
to
be
able
to
commune
i
said
the
same
to
myself
and
tried
the
question
in
many
ways
the
fact
remained
that
we
could
not
commune
that
is
with
any
heartiness
and
although
i
may
have
done
her
wrong
it
was
i
thought
to
be
accounted
for
something
in
this
way
the
saviour
of
whom
she
spoke
so
often
and
evidently
thought
so
much
was
in
a
great
measure
a
being
of
her
own
fancy
so
much
so
that
she
manifested
no
desire
to
find
out
what
the
christ
was
who
had
spent
three
and
thirty
years
in
making
a
revelation
of
himself
to
the
world
the
knowledge
she
had
about
him
was
not
even
at
but
at
many
removes
she
did
not
study
his
words
or
his
actions
to
learn
his
thoughts
or
his
meanings
but
lived
in
a
kind
of
dreamland
of
her
own
which
could
be
interesting
only
to
the
dreamer
now
if
we
are
to
come
to
god
through
christ
it
must
surely
be
by
knowing
christ
it
must
be
through
the
knowledge
of
christ
that
the
spirit
of
the
father
mainly
works
in
the
members
of
his
body
and
it
seemed
to
me
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
know
him
and
the
power
of
his
resurrection
therefore
we
had
scarcely
enough
of
common
ground
as
i
say
to
meet
upon
i
could
not
help
contrasting
her
religion
with
that
of
marion
clare
at
length
i
had
a
note
from
her
begging
me
to
go
and
see
her
at
her
house
at
richmond
and
apologizing
for
her
not
coming
to
me
on
the
score
of
her
health
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
go
but
sadly
grudged
the
loss
of
time
it
seemed
for
i
expected
neither
pleasure
nor
profit
from
the
visit
percivale
went
with
me
and
left
me
at
the
door
to
have
a
row
on
the
river
and
call
for
me
at
a
certain
hour
the
house
and
grounds
were
luxurious
and
lovely
both
two
often
dissociated
qualities
she
could
have
nothing
to
desire
of
this
world
gifts
i
thought
but
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
into
which
i
had
been
shown
i
was
shocked
at
the
change
i
saw
in
her
almost
to
my
horror
she
was
in
a
widow
cap
and
disease
and
coming
death
were
plain
on
every
feature
such
was
the
contrast
that
the
face
in
my
memory
appeared
that
of
health
my
dear
mrs
cromwell
i
gasped
out
you
see
she
said
and
sitting
down
on
a
chair
looked
at
me
with
lustreless
eyes
death
had
been
hovering
about
her
windows
before
but
had
entered
at
last
not
to
take
the
sickly
young
woman
longing
to
die
but
the
hale
man
who
would
have
clung
to
the
last
edge
of
life
he
is
taken
and
i
am
left
she
said
abruptly
after
a
long
pause
her
drawl
had
vanished
pain
and
grief
had
made
her
simple
then
i
thought
with
myself
she
did
love
him
but
i
could
say
nothing
she
took
my
silence
for
the
sympathy
it
was
and
smiled
a
smile
so
different
from
that
little
sad
smile
she
used
to
have
really
pathetic
now
and
with
hardly
a
glimmer
in
it
of
the
old
i
rose
put
my
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
she
laid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
wept
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
i
faltered
out
for
her
sorrow
filled
me
with
a
respect
that
was
new
yes
she
returned
as
gently
as
hopelessly
and
whom
he
does
not
love
as
well
you
have
no
ground
for
saying
so
i
answered
the
apostle
does
not
my
lamp
is
gone
out
she
said
gone
out
in
darkness
utter
darkness
you
warned
me
and
i
did
not
heed
the
warning
i
thought
i
knew
better
but
i
was
full
of
and
now
i
am
wandering
where
there
is
no
way
and
no
light
my
iniquities
have
found
me
out
i
did
not
say
what
i
thought
i
saw
plain
enough
that
her
lamp
was
just
beginning
to
burn
neither
did
i
try
to
persuade
her
that
her
iniquities
were
small
but
the
bridegroom
i
said
is
not
yet
come
there
is
time
to
go
and
get
some
oil
where
am
i
to
get
it
she
returned
in
a
tone
of
despair
from
the
bridegroom
himself
i
said
no
she
answered
i
have
talked
and
talked
and
talked
and
you
know
he
says
he
abhors
talkers
i
am
one
of
those
to
whom
he
will
say
know
you
not
and
you
will
answer
him
that
you
have
eaten
and
drunk
in
his
presence
and
cast
out
devils
and
no
no
i
will
say
he
is
right
that
it
is
all
my
own
fault
that
i
thought
i
was
something
when
i
was
nothing
but
that
i
know
better
now
a
dreadful
fit
of
coughing
interrupted
her
as
soon
as
it
was
over
i
said
and
what
will
the
lord
say
to
you
do
you
think
when
you
have
said
so
to
him
depart
from
me
she
answered
in
a
hollow
forced
voice
no
i
returned
he
will
say
know
you
well
you
have
told
me
the
truth
come
in
you
think
so
she
cried
you
never
used
to
think
well
of
me
those
who
were
turned
away
i
said
avoiding
her
last
words
were
trying
to
make
themselves
out
better
than
they
were
they
trusted
not
in
the
love
of
christ
but
in
what
they
thought
their
worth
and
social
standing
perhaps
if
their
deeds
had
been
as
good
as
they
thought
them
they
would
have
known
better
than
to
trust
in
them
if
they
had
told
him
the
truth
if
they
had
said
we
are
workers
of
iniquity
lord
we
used
to
be
hypocrites
but
we
speak
the
truth
now
forgive
us
do
you
think
he
would
then
have
turned
them
away
no
surely
if
your
lamp
has
gone
out
make
haste
and
tell
him
how
careless
you
have
been
tell
him
all
and
pray
him
for
oil
and
light
and
see
whether
your
lamp
will
not
straightway
glimmer
glimmer
first
and
then
glow
ah
mrs
percivale
she
cried
i
would
something
for
his
sake
now
if
i
might
but
i
can
not
if
i
had
but
resisted
the
disease
in
me
for
the
sake
of
serving
him
i
might
have
been
able
now
but
my
chance
is
over
i
can
not
now
i
have
too
much
pain
and
death
looks
such
a
different
thing
now
i
used
to
think
of
it
only
as
a
kind
of
going
to
sleep
easy
though
sad
sad
i
mean
in
the
eyes
of
mourning
friends
but
alas
i
have
no
friends
now
that
my
husband
is
gone
i
never
dreamed
of
him
going
first
he
loved
me
indeed
he
did
though
you
will
hardly
believe
it
but
i
always
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
i
never
saw
how
beautiful
and
unselfish
he
was
till
he
was
gone
i
have
been
selfish
and
stupid
and
dull
and
my
sins
have
found
me
out
a
great
darkness
has
fallen
upon
me
and
although
weary
of
life
instead
of
longing
for
death
i
shrink
from
it
with
horror
my
cough
will
not
let
me
sleep
there
is
nothing
but
weariness
in
my
body
and
despair
in
my
heart
oh
how
black
and
dreary
the
nights
are
i
think
of
the
time
in
your
house
as
of
an
earthly
paradise
but
where
is
the
heavenly
paradise
i
used
to
dream
of
then
would
it
content
you
i
asked
to
be
able
to
dream
of
it
again
no
no
i
want
something
very
different
now
those
fancies
look
so
uninteresting
and
stupid
now
all
i
want
now
is
to
hear
god
say
forgive
you
and
my
husband
i
must
have
troubled
him
sorely
you
do
know
how
good
he
was
percivale
made
no
pretences
like
silly
me
do
you
know
she
went
on
lowering
her
voice
and
speaking
with
something
like
horror
in
its
tone
do
you
know
i
can
not
hymns
as
she
said
it
she
looked
up
in
my
face
with
the
anticipation
of
the
horror
she
expected
to
see
manifested
there
i
could
not
help
smiling
the
case
was
not
one
for
argument
of
any
kind
i
thought
for
a
moment
then
merely
repeated
the
verse
when
the
law
threatens
endless
death
upon
the
awful
hill
straightway
from
her
consuming
breath
my
soul
goes
higher
still
goeth
to
jesus
wounded
slain
and
maketh
him
her
home
whence
she
will
not
go
out
again
and
where
death
can
not
come
ah
that
is
good
she
said
if
only
i
could
get
to
him
but
i
can
not
get
to
him
he
is
so
far
off
he
seems
to
be
nowhere
i
think
she
was
going
to
say
but
changed
the
word
if
you
felt
for
a
moment
how
helpless
and
wretched
i
feel
especially
in
the
early
morning
she
went
on
how
there
seems
nothing
to
look
for
and
no
help
to
be
had
you
would
pity
rather
than
blame
me
though
i
know
i
deserve
blame
i
feel
as
if
all
the
heart
and
soul
and
strength
and
mind
with
which
we
are
told
to
love
god
had
gone
out
of
me
or
rather
as
if
i
had
never
had
any
i
doubt
if
i
ever
had
i
tried
very
hard
for
a
long
time
to
get
a
sight
of
jesus
to
feel
myself
in
his
presence
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
i
have
quite
given
it
up
now
i
made
her
lie
on
the
sofa
and
sat
down
beside
her
do
you
think
i
said
that
any
one
before
he
came
could
have
imagined
such
a
visitor
to
the
world
as
jesus
christ
i
suppose
not
she
answered
listlessly
then
no
more
can
you
come
near
him
now
by
trying
to
imagine
him
you
can
not
represent
to
yourself
the
reality
the
being
who
can
comfort
you
in
other
words
you
can
not
take
him
into
your
heart
he
only
knows
himself
and
he
only
can
reveal
himself
to
you
and
not
until
he
does
so
can
you
find
any
certainty
or
any
peace
but
he
does
he
wo
reveal
himself
to
me
suppose
you
had
forgotten
what
some
friend
of
your
childhood
was
like
say
if
it
were
possible
your
own
mother
suppose
you
could
not
recall
a
feature
of
her
face
or
the
color
of
her
eyes
and
suppose
that
while
you
were
very
miserable
about
it
you
remembered
all
at
once
that
you
had
a
portrait
of
her
in
an
old
desk
you
had
not
opened
for
years
what
would
you
do
go
and
get
it
she
answered
like
a
child
at
the
sunday
school
then
why
should
you
do
so
now
you
have
such
a
portrait
of
jesus
far
truer
and
more
complete
than
any
other
kind
of
portrait
can
be
the
portrait
his
own
deeds
and
words
give
us
of
him
i
see
what
you
mean
but
that
is
all
about
long
ago
and
i
want
him
now
that
is
in
a
book
and
i
want
him
in
my
heart
how
are
you
to
get
him
into
your
heart
how
could
you
have
him
there
except
by
knowing
him
but
perhaps
you
think
you
do
know
him
i
am
certain
i
do
not
know
him
at
least
as
i
want
to
know
him
she
said
no
doubt
i
went
on
he
can
speak
to
your
heart
without
the
record
and
i
think
is
speaking
to
you
now
in
this
very
want
of
him
you
feel
but
how
could
he
show
himself
to
you
otherwise
than
by
helping
you
to
understand
the
revelation
of
himself
which
it
cost
him
such
labor
to
afford
if
the
story
were
millions
of
years
old
so
long
as
it
was
true
it
would
be
all
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
ended
only
yesterday
for
being
what
he
represented
himself
he
never
can
change
to
know
what
he
was
then
is
to
know
what
he
is
now
but
if
i
knew
him
so
that
would
be
to
have
him
with
me
no
but
in
that
knowledge
he
might
come
to
you
it
is
by
the
door
of
that
knowledge
that
his
spirit
which
is
himself
comes
into
the
soul
you
would
at
least
be
more
able
to
pray
to
him
you
would
know
what
kind
of
a
being
you
had
to
cry
to
would
thus
come
nearer
to
him
and
no
one
ever
drew
nigh
to
him
to
whom
he
did
not
also
draw
nigh
if
you
would
but
read
the
story
as
if
you
had
never
read
it
before
as
if
you
were
reading
the
history
of
a
man
you
heard
of
for
the
first
time
surely
you
not
a
unitarian
mrs
percivale
she
said
half
lifting
her
head
and
looking
at
me
with
a
dim
terror
in
her
pale
eyes
god
forbid
i
answered
but
i
would
that
many
who
think
they
know
better
believed
in
him
half
as
much
as
many
unitarians
do
it
is
only
by
understanding
and
believing
in
that
humanity
of
his
which
in
such
pain
and
labor
manifested
his
godhead
that
we
can
come
to
know
it
know
that
godhead
i
mean
in
virtue
of
which
alone
he
was
a
true
and
perfect
man
that
godhead
which
alone
can
satisfy
with
peace
and
hope
the
poorest
human
soul
for
it
also
is
the
offspring
of
god
i
ceased
and
for
some
moments
she
sat
silent
then
she
said
feebly
there
a
bible
somewhere
in
the
room
i
found
it
and
read
the
story
of
the
woman
who
came
behind
him
in
terror
and
touched
the
hem
of
his
garment
i
could
hardly
read
it
for
the
emotion
it
caused
in
myself
and
when
i
ceased
i
saw
her
weeping
silently
a
servant
entered
with
the
message
that
percivale
had
called
for
me
i
can
not
see
him
she
sobbed
of
course
not
i
replied
i
must
leave
you
now
but
i
will
come
again
come
often
if
you
like
you
are
as
kind
as
ever
she
returned
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
will
you
come
and
be
with
me
when
when
she
could
not
finish
for
sobs
i
will
i
said
knowing
well
what
she
meant
this
is
how
i
imagined
the
change
to
have
come
about
what
had
seemed
her
faith
had
been
in
a
great
measure
but
her
hope
and
imagination
occupying
themselves
with
the
forms
of
the
religion
towards
which
all
that
was
highest
in
her
nature
dimly
urged
the
two
characteristics
of
amicability
and
selfishness
not
unfrequently
combined
rendered
it
easy
for
her
to
deceive
herself
or
rather
conspired
to
prevent
her
from
undeceiving
herself
as
to
the
quality
and
worth
of
her
religion
for
if
she
had
been
other
than
amiable
the
misery
following
the
outbreaks
of
temper
which
would
have
been
of
certain
occurrence
in
the
state
of
her
health
would
have
made
her
aware
in
some
degree
of
her
moral
condition
and
if
her
thoughts
had
not
been
centred
upon
herself
she
would
in
her
care
for
others
have
learned
her
own
helplessness
and
the
devotion
of
her
good
husband
not
then
accepted
merely
as
a
natural
homage
to
her
worth
would
have
shown
itself
as
a
love
beyond
her
deserts
and
would
have
roused
the
longing
to
be
worthy
of
it
she
saw
now
that
he
must
have
imagined
her
far
better
than
she
was
but
she
had
not
meant
to
deceive
him
she
had
but
followed
the
impulses
of
a
bright
shallow
nature
but
that
last
epithet
bids
me
pause
and
remember
that
my
father
has
taught
me
and
that
i
have
found
the
lesson
true
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
shallow
nature
every
nature
is
infinitely
deep
for
the
works
of
god
are
everlasting
also
there
is
no
nature
that
is
not
shallow
to
what
it
must
become
i
suspect
every
nature
must
have
the
subsoil
ploughing
of
sorrow
before
it
can
recognize
either
its
present
poverty
or
its
possible
wealth
when
her
husband
died
suddenly
of
apoplexy
she
was
stunned
for
a
time
gradually
awaking
to
a
miserable
sense
of
unprotected
loneliness
so
much
the
more
painful
for
her
weakly
condition
and
the
overcare
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
she
was
an
only
child
and
had
become
an
orphan
within
a
year
or
two
after
her
early
marriage
left
thus
without
shelter
like
a
delicate
plant
whose
house
of
glass
has
been
shattered
she
speedily
recognized
her
true
condition
with
no
one
to
heed
her
whims
and
no
one
capable
of
sympathizing
with
the
genuine
misery
which
supervened
her
disease
gathered
strength
rapidly
her
lamp
went
out
and
she
saw
no
light
beyond
for
the
smoke
of
that
lamp
had
dimmed
the
windows
at
which
the
stars
would
have
looked
in
when
life
became
dreary
her
fancies
despoiled
of
the
halo
they
had
cast
on
the
fogs
of
selfish
comfort
ceased
to
interest
her
and
the
future
grew
a
vague
darkness
an
uncertainty
teeming
with
questions
to
which
she
had
no
answer
henceforth
she
was
conscious
of
life
only
as
a
weakness
as
the
want
of
a
deeper
life
to
hold
it
up
existence
had
become
a
during
faint
and
self
hateful
she
saw
that
she
was
poor
and
miserable
and
blind
and
naked
that
she
had
never
had
faith
fit
to
support
her
but
out
of
this
darkness
dawned
at
least
a
twilight
so
gradual
so
slow
that
i
can
not
tell
when
or
how
the
darkness
began
to
melt
she
became
aware
of
a
deeper
and
simpler
need
than
hitherto
she
had
known
the
need
of
life
in
herself
the
life
of
the
son
of
god
i
went
to
see
her
often
at
the
time
when
i
began
this
history
i
was
going
every
other
day
sometimes
oftener
for
her
end
seemed
to
be
drawing
nigh
her
weakness
had
greatly
increased
she
could
but
just
walk
across
the
room
and
was
constantly
restless
she
had
no
great
continuous
pain
but
sharp
fits
of
it
she
looked
genuinely
sad
and
her
spirits
never
recovered
themselves
she
seldom
looked
out
of
the
window
the
daylight
seemed
to
distress
her
flowers
were
the
only
links
between
her
and
the
outer
world
wild
ones
for
the
scent
of
and
even
that
of
most
garden
ones
she
could
not
bear
she
had
been
very
fond
of
music
but
could
no
longer
endure
her
piano
every
note
seemed
struck
on
a
nerve
but
she
was
generally
quiet
in
her
mind
and
often
peaceful
the
more
her
body
decayed
about
her
the
more
her
spirit
seemed
to
come
alive
it
was
the
calm
of
a
gray
evening
not
so
lovely
as
a
golden
sunset
or
a
silvery
moonlight
but
more
sweet
than
either
she
talked
little
of
her
feelings
but
evidently
longed
after
the
words
of
our
lord
as
she
listened
to
some
of
them
i
could
see
the
eyes
which
had
now
grown
dim
with
suffering
gleam
with
the
light
of
holy
longing
and
humble
adoration
for
some
time
she
often
referred
to
her
coming
departure
and
confessed
that
she
feared
death
not
so
much
what
might
be
on
the
other
side
as
the
dark
way
itself
the
struggle
the
torture
the
fainting
but
by
degrees
her
allusions
to
it
became
rarer
and
at
length
ceased
almost
entirely
once
i
said
to
her
are
you
afraid
of
death
still
eleanor
no
not
much
she
replied
after
a
brief
pause
he
may
do
with
me
whatever
he
likes
knowing
so
well
what
marion
could
do
to
comfort
and
support
and
therefore
desirous
of
bringing
them
together
i
took
her
one
day
with
me
but
certain
that
the
thought
of
seeing
a
stranger
would
render
my
poor
eleanor
uneasy
and
that
what
discomposure
a
sudden
introduction
might
cause
would
speedily
vanish
in
marion
presence
i
did
not
tell
her
what
i
was
going
to
do
nor
in
this
did
i
mistake
before
we
left
it
was
plain
that
marion
had
a
far
more
soothing
influence
upon
her
than
i
had
myself
she
looked
eagerly
for
her
next
visit
and
my
mind
was
now
more
at
peace
concerning
her
one
evening
after
listening
to
some
stories
from
marion
about
her
friends
cromwell
said
ah
miss
clare
to
think
i
might
have
done
something
for
by
doing
it
for
alas
i
have
led
a
useless
life
and
am
dying
out
of
this
world
without
having
borne
any
fruit
ah
me
me
you
are
doing
a
good
deal
for
him
now
said
marion
and
hard
work
too
she
added
harder
far
than
mine
i
am
only
dying
she
returned
so
sadly
you
are
enduring
chastisement
said
marion
the
lord
gives
one
one
thing
to
do
and
another
another
we
have
no
right
to
wish
for
other
work
than
he
gives
us
it
is
rebellious
and
unchildlike
whatever
it
may
seem
neither
have
we
any
right
to
wish
to
be
better
in
way
we
must
wish
to
be
better
in
but
i
like
to
do
something
for
bearing
is
only
for
myself
surely
i
may
wish
that
no
you
may
not
bearing
is
not
only
for
yourself
you
are
quite
wrong
in
thinking
you
do
nothing
for
him
in
enduring
returned
marion
with
that
abrupt
decision
of
hers
which
seemed
to
some
like
rudeness
what
is
the
will
of
god
is
it
not
your
sanctification
and
why
did
he
make
the
captain
of
our
salvation
perfect
through
suffering
was
it
not
that
he
might
in
like
manner
bring
many
sons
into
glory
then
if
you
are
enduring
you
are
working
with
god
for
the
perfection
through
suffering
of
one
more
you
are
working
for
god
in
yourself
that
the
will
of
god
may
be
done
in
you
that
he
may
have
his
very
own
way
with
you
it
is
the
only
work
he
requires
of
you
now
do
it
not
only
willingly
then
but
contentedly
to
make
people
good
is
all
his
labor
be
good
and
you
are
a
with
god
in
the
highest
region
of
labor
he
does
not
want
you
for
other
people
at
the
emphasis
marion
laid
on
the
last
word
cromwell
glanced
sharply
up
a
light
broke
over
her
face
she
had
understood
and
with
a
smile
was
silent
one
evening
when
we
were
both
with
her
it
had
grown
very
sultry
and
breathless
is
it
very
close
dear
mrs
percivale
she
said
i
rose
to
get
a
fan
and
marion
leaving
the
window
as
if
moved
by
a
sudden
resolve
went
and
opened
the
piano
cromwell
made
a
hasty
motion
as
if
she
must
prevent
her
but
such
was
my
faith
in
my
friend
soul
as
well
as
heart
in
her
divine
taste
as
well
as
her
human
faculty
that
i
ventured
to
lay
my
hand
on
cromwell
it
was
enough
for
sweetness
like
hers
she
yielded
instantly
and
lay
still
evidently
nerving
herself
to
suffer
but
the
first
movement
stole
so
soft
and
soullike
on
her
ear
trembling
as
it
were
on
the
between
sound
and
silence
that
she
missed
the
pain
she
expected
and
found
only
the
pleasure
she
looked
not
for
marion
hands
made
the
instrument
sigh
and
sing
not
merely
as
with
a
human
voice
but
as
with
a
human
soul
her
own
voice
next
evolved
itself
from
the
dim
uncertainty
in
sweet
proportions
and
delicate
modulations
stealing
its
way
into
the
heart
to
set
first
one
chord
then
another
vibrating
until
the
whole
soul
was
filled
with
responses
if
i
add
that
her
articulation
was
as
nearly
perfect
as
the
act
of
singing
will
permit
my
reader
may
well
believe
that
a
song
of
hers
would
do
what
a
song
might
where
she
got
the
song
she
then
sung
she
always
avoids
telling
me
i
had
told
her
all
i
knew
and
understood
concerning
cromwell
and
have
my
suspicions
this
is
the
song
i
fancy
i
hear
a
whisper
as
of
leaves
in
a
gentle
air
is
it
wrong
i
wonder
to
fancy
it
may
be
the
tree
up
there
the
tree
that
heals
the
nations
growing
amidst
the
street
and
dropping
for
who
will
gather
its
apples
at
their
feet
i
fancy
i
hear
a
rushing
as
of
waters
down
a
slope
is
it
wrong
i
wonder
to
fancy
it
may
be
the
river
of
hope
the
river
of
crystal
waters
that
flows
from
the
very
throne
and
runs
through
the
street
of
the
city
with
a
softly
jubilant
tone
i
fancy
a
twilight
round
me
and
a
wandering
of
the
breeze
with
a
hush
in
that
high
city
and
a
going
in
the
trees
but
i
know
there
will
be
no
night
there
no
coming
and
going
day
for
the
holy
face
of
the
father
will
be
perfect
light
alway
i
could
do
without
the
darkness
and
better
without
the
sun
but
oh
i
should
like
a
twilight
after
the
day
was
done
would
he
lay
his
hand
on
his
forehead
on
his
hair
as
white
as
wool
and
shine
one
hour
through
his
fingers
till
the
shadow
had
made
me
cool
but
the
thought
is
very
foolish
if
that
face
i
did
but
see
all
else
would
be
all
forgotten
river
and
twilight
and
tree
i
should
seek
i
should
care
for
nothing
beholding
his
countenance
and
fear
only
to
lose
one
glimmer
by
one
single
sideway
glance
is
but
again
a
foolish
fancy
to
picture
the
countenance
so
which
is
shining
in
all
our
spirits
making
them
white
as
snow
come
to
me
shine
in
me
master
and
i
care
not
for
river
or
tree
care
for
no
sorrow
or
crying
if
only
thou
shine
in
me
i
would
lie
on
my
bed
for
ages
looking
out
on
the
dusty
street
where
whisper
nor
leaves
nor
waters
nor
any
thing
cool
and
sweet
at
my
heart
this
ghastly
fainting
and
this
burning
in
my
blood
if
only
i
knew
thou
wast
with
me
wast
with
me
and
making
me
good
when
she
rose
from
the
piano
cromwell
stretched
out
her
hand
for
hers
and
held
it
some
time
unable
to
speak
then
she
said
that
has
done
me
good
i
hope
i
will
try
to
be
more
patient
for
i
think
he
teaching
me
she
died
at
length
in
my
arms
i
can
not
linger
over
that
last
time
she
suffered
a
good
deal
but
dying
people
are
generally
patient
she
went
without
a
struggle
the
last
words
i
heard
her
utter
were
yes
lord
after
which
she
breathed
but
once
a
came
over
her
face
which
froze
upon
it
and
remained
until
the
covered
it
but
i
shall
see
it
i
trust
a
whole
smile
some
day
chapter
xxxix
ancestral
wisdom
i
did
think
of
having
a
chapter
about
children
before
finishing
my
book
but
this
is
not
going
to
be
the
kind
of
chapter
i
thought
of
like
most
mothers
i
suppose
i
think
myself
an
authority
on
the
subject
and
which
is
to
me
more
assuring
than
any
judgment
of
my
own
my
father
says
that
i
have
been
in
a
measure
successful
in
bringing
mine
up
only
they
not
brought
up
very
far
yet
hence
arose
the
temptation
to
lay
down
a
few
practical
rules
i
had
proved
and
found
answer
but
as
soon
as
i
began
to
contemplate
the
writing
of
them
down
i
began
to
imagine
and
attempting
to
carry
them
out
and
saw
what
a
dreadful
muddle
they
would
make
of
it
and
what
mischief
would
thence
lie
at
my
door
only
one
thing
can
be
worse
than
the
attempt
to
carry
out
rules
whose
principles
are
not
understood
and
that
is
the
neglect
of
those
which
are
understood
and
seen
to
be
right
suppose
for
instance
i
were
to
say
that
corporal
punishment
was
wholesome
involving
less
suffering
than
most
other
punishments
more
effectual
in
the
result
and
leaving
no
sting
or
sense
of
unkindness
whereas
mental
punishment
considered
by
many
to
be
more
refined
and
therefore
less
degrading
was
often
cruel
to
a
sensitive
child
and
deadening
to
a
stubborn
one
suppose
i
said
this
and
a
woman
like
my
aunt
millicent
were
to
take
it
up
whippings
would
have
no
more
effect
than
if
her
rod
were
made
of
butterflies
feathers
they
would
be
a
mockery
to
her
children
and
bring
law
into
contempt
while
if
a
certain
father
i
know
were
to
be
convinced
by
my
arguments
he
would
fill
his
children
with
terror
of
him
now
and
with
hatred
afterwards
of
the
result
of
severity
i
know
at
least
one
instance
at
present
the
father
to
whom
i
refer
disapproves
of
whipping
even
a
man
who
has
been
dancing
on
his
wife
with
shoes
because
it
would
tend
to
brutalize
him
but
he
taunts
and
stings
and
confines
in
solitude
for
lengthened
periods
boys
and
that
for
faults
which
i
should
consider
very
venial
then
again
if
i
were
to
lay
down
the
rule
that
we
must
be
as
tender
of
the
feelings
of
our
children
as
if
they
were
who
had
to
learn
alas
to
understand
our
rough
ways
how
would
that
be
taken
by
a
certain
french
couple
i
know
who
not
appearing
until
after
the
dinner
to
which
they
had
accepted
an
invitation
was
over
gave
as
the
reason
that
it
had
been
quite
out
of
their
power
for
darling
désirée
their
only
child
had
declared
they
should
go
and
that
she
would
cry
if
they
did
nay
went
so
far
as
to
insist
on
their
going
to
bed
which
they
were
however
reluctant
compelled
to
do
they
had
actually
undressed
and
pretended
to
retire
for
the
night
but
as
soon
as
she
was
safely
asleep
rose
and
joined
their
friends
calm
in
the
consciousness
of
abundant
excuse
the
marvel
to
me
is
that
so
many
children
turn
out
so
well
after
all
i
think
there
can
be
no
harm
in
mentioning
a
few
general
principles
laid
down
by
my
father
they
are
such
as
to
commend
themselves
most
to
the
most
practical
and
first
for
a
few
negative
ones
never
to
disobedience
and
never
threaten
what
you
are
not
prepared
to
carry
out
never
lose
your
temper
i
do
not
say
be
anger
is
sometimes
indispensable
especially
where
there
has
been
any
thing
mean
dishonest
or
cruel
but
anger
is
very
different
from
loss
of
temper
footnote
my
aunt
millicent
is
always
saying
i
am
with
you
but
the
announcement
begets
no
sign
of
responsive
grief
on
the
face
of
the
stolid
child
before
her
she
never
whipped
a
child
in
her
life
if
she
had
and
it
had
but
roused
some
positive
anger
in
the
child
instead
of
that
undertone
of
complaint
which
is
always
oozing
out
of
every
one
of
them
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
gain
but
the
poor
lady
is
one
of
the
people
and
must
be
in
preparation
for
a
development
of
which
i
have
no
prevision
the
only
stroke
of
originality
i
thought
i
knew
of
her
was
this
to
the
register
of
her
children
births
baptisms
and
confirmations
entered
on
a
of
the
family
bible
she
has
subjoined
the
record
of
every
disease
each
has
had
with
the
year
month
and
day
and
in
one
case
the
hour
when
each
distemper
made
its
appearance
after
most
of
the
main
entries
you
may
read
or
her
at
such
a
date
but
alas
for
the
originality
she
has
just
told
me
that
her
maternal
grandmother
did
the
same
how
strange
that
she
and
my
father
should
have
had
the
same
father
i
if
they
had
had
the
same
mother
too
i
should
have
been
utterly
bewildered
of
all
things
never
sneer
at
them
and
be
careful
even
how
you
rally
them
do
not
try
to
work
on
their
feelings
feelings
are
far
too
delicate
things
to
be
used
for
tools
it
is
like
taking
the
mainspring
out
of
your
watch
and
notching
it
for
a
saw
it
may
be
a
wonderful
saw
but
how
fares
your
watch
especially
avoid
doing
so
in
connection
with
religious
things
for
so
you
will
assuredly
deaden
them
to
all
that
is
finest
let
your
feelings
not
your
efforts
on
theirs
affect
them
with
a
sympathy
the
more
powerful
that
it
is
not
forced
upon
them
and
in
order
to
do
this
avoid
being
too
english
in
the
hiding
of
your
feelings
a
man
own
family
has
a
right
to
share
in
his
feelings
never
show
that
you
doubt
except
you
are
able
to
convict
to
doubt
an
honest
child
is
to
do
what
you
can
to
make
a
liar
of
him
and
to
believe
a
liar
if
he
is
not
altogether
shameless
is
to
shame
him
the
masters
in
schools
who
unlike
the
ideal
arnold
are
in
the
habit
of
boys
have
a
large
share
in
making
the
liars
they
so
often
are
certainly
the
vileness
of
a
lie
is
not
the
same
in
one
who
knows
that
whatever
he
says
will
be
regarded
with
suspicion
and
the
master
who
does
not
know
an
honest
boy
after
he
has
been
some
time
in
his
class
gives
good
reason
for
doubting
whether
he
be
himself
an
honest
man
and
incapable
of
the
lying
he
is
ready
to
attribute
to
all
alike
this
last
is
my
own
remark
not
my
father
i
have
an
honest
boy
at
school
and
i
know
how
he
fares
i
say
honest
for
though
as
a
mother
i
can
hardly
expect
to
be
believed
i
have
ground
for
believing
that
he
would
rather
die
than
lie
i
know
would
rather
he
died
than
lied
instil
no
religious
doctrine
apart
from
its
duty
if
it
have
no
duty
as
its
necessary
embodiment
the
doctrine
may
well
be
regarded
as
doubtful
do
not
be
hard
on
mere
quarrelling
which
like
a
storm
in
nature
is
often
helpful
in
clearing
the
moral
atmosphere
stop
it
by
a
judgment
between
the
parties
but
be
severe
as
to
the
of
quarrelling
and
the
temper
shown
in
it
especially
give
no
quarter
to
any
unfairness
arising
from
greed
or
spite
use
your
strongest
language
with
regard
to
that
now
for
a
few
of
my
father
positive
rules
always
let
them
come
to
you
and
always
hear
what
they
have
to
say
if
they
bring
a
complaint
always
examine
into
it
and
dispense
pure
justice
and
nothing
but
justice
cultivate
a
love
of
every
one
of
course
likes
to
but
no
one
ought
to
be
left
to
imagine
therefore
that
he
teach
from
the
very
first
from
the
infancy
capable
of
sucking
a
to
share
with
neighbors
never
refuse
the
offering
a
child
brings
you
except
you
have
a
good
reason
and
it
and
never
to
partake
that
involves
hideous
possibilities
in
its
effects
on
the
child
the
necessity
of
giving
a
reason
for
refusing
a
kindness
has
no
relation
to
what
is
supposed
by
some
to
be
the
necessity
of
giving
a
reason
with
every
command
there
is
no
such
necessity
of
course
there
ought
to
be
a
reason
in
every
command
that
it
be
desirable
sometimes
to
explain
it
is
all
my
father
would
allow
allow
a
great
deal
of
noise
as
much
as
is
fairly
endurable
but
the
moment
they
seem
getting
beyond
their
own
control
stop
the
noise
at
once
also
put
a
stop
at
once
to
all
fretting
and
grumbling
favor
the
development
of
each
in
the
direction
of
his
own
bent
help
him
to
develop
himself
but
do
not
development
to
do
so
is
most
dangerous
mind
the
moral
nature
and
it
will
take
care
of
the
intellectual
in
other
words
the
best
thing
for
the
intellect
is
the
cultivation
of
the
conscience
not
in
casuistry
but
in
conduct
it
may
take
longer
to
arrive
but
the
end
will
be
the
highest
possible
health
vigor
and
ratio
of
progress
discourage
emulation
and
insist
on
duty
not
often
but
strongly
having
written
these
out
chiefly
from
notes
i
had
made
of
a
long
talk
with
my
father
i
gave
them
to
percivale
to
read
rather
ponderous
do
you
think
for
weaving
into
a
narrative
was
his
remark
my
narrative
is
full
of
things
far
from
light
i
returned
i
did
say
they
were
heavy
you
know
that
is
quite
another
thing
i
am
afraid
you
mean
generally
uninteresting
but
there
are
parents
who
might
make
them
useful
and
the
rest
of
my
readers
could
skip
them
i
only
mean
that
a
narrative
be
it
ever
so
serious
must
not
intrench
on
the
moral
essay
or
sermon
it
is
much
too
late
i
fear
to
tell
me
that
but
please
remember
i
am
not
giving
the
precepts
as
of
my
own
discovery
though
i
sought
to
verify
them
by
practice
but
as
what
they
are
my
father
he
did
not
seem
to
see
the
bearing
of
the
argument
i
want
my
book
to
be
useful
i
said
as
a
mother
i
want
to
share
the
help
i
have
had
myself
with
other
mothers
i
am
only
speaking
from
the
point
of
art
he
returned
and
that
a
point
i
have
never
thought
of
any
farther
at
least
than
writing
as
good
english
as
i
might
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
never
thought
of
the
shape
of
the
book
your
monthly
papers
would
make
yes
i
do
think
i
have
scarcely
at
all
i
believe
then
you
ought
but
i
know
nothing
about
that
kind
of
thing
i
have
an
idea
in
my
head
concerning
the
art
of
and
it
is
too
late
so
far
at
least
as
this
book
is
concerned
to
begin
to
study
it
now
i
wonder
how
my
pictures
would
get
on
in
that
way
you
can
see
how
my
book
has
got
on
well
or
ill
there
it
all
but
is
i
had
to
do
with
facts
and
not
with
art
but
even
a
biography
in
the
ordering
of
its
parts
in
the
arrangement
of
its
light
and
shade
and
in
the
harmony
of
the
it
too
late
i
tell
you
husband
the
book
is
all
but
done
besides
one
who
would
write
a
biography
after
the
fashion
of
a
picture
would
probably
even
without
attributing
a
single
virtue
that
was
not
present
or
suppressing
a
single
fault
that
was
yet
produce
a
false
book
the
principle
i
have
followed
has
been
to
try
from
the
first
to
put
as
much
value
that
is
as
much
truth
as
i
could
into
my
story
perhaps
instead
of
those
maxims
of
my
father
for
the
education
of
children
you
would
have
preferred
such
specimens
of
your
own
children
sermons
as
you
made
me
read
to
you
for
the
twentieth
time
yesterday
instead
of
smiling
with
his
own
quiet
kind
smile
as
he
worked
on
at
his
picture
of
athanasius
with
no
friend
but
god
and
death
he
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
and
said
a
capital
idea
if
you
give
those
word
for
word
i
shall
yield
the
precepts
are
you
out
of
your
five
wits
husband
i
exclaimed
would
you
have
everybody
take
me
for
the
latest
incarnation
of
the
oldest
insanity
in
the
world
that
of
maternity
but
i
am
really
an
idiot
for
you
could
never
have
meant
it
i
do
most
soberly
and
distinctly
mean
it
they
would
amuse
your
readers
very
much
and
without
offending
those
who
may
prefer
your
maxims
to
your
children
sermons
would
incline
those
who
might
otherwise
vote
the
former
a
bore
to
regard
them
with
the
clemency
resulting
from
amusement
but
i
desire
no
such
exercise
of
clemency
the
precepts
are
admirable
and
those
need
not
take
them
who
do
not
like
them
so
the
others
can
skip
the
sermons
but
i
am
sure
they
will
give
a
few
mothers
at
least
a
little
amusement
they
will
prove
besides
that
you
follow
your
own
rule
of
putting
a
very
small
quantity
of
sage
into
the
stuffing
of
your
goslings
as
also
that
you
have
succeeded
in
making
them
capable
of
manifesting
what
nonsense
is
indigenous
in
them
i
think
them
very
funny
that
may
be
paternal
prejudice
think
them
very
silly
as
well
that
may
be
maternal
solicitude
i
suspect
that
the
more
of
a
philosopher
any
one
of
your
readers
is
the
more
suggestive
will
he
find
these
genuine
utterances
of
an
age
at
which
the
means
of
expression
so
much
exceed
the
matter
to
be
expressed
the
idea
began
to
look
not
altogether
so
absurd
as
at
first
and
a
little
more
argument
sufficed
to
make
me
resolve
to
put
the
absurdities
themselves
to
the
test
of
passing
leisurely
through
my
brain
while
i
copied
them
out
possibly
for
the
press
the
result
is
that
i
am
going
to
risk
printing
them
determined
should
i
find
afterwards
that
i
have
made
a
blunder
to
throw
the
whole
blame
upon
my
husband
what
still
makes
me
shrink
the
most
is
the
recollection
of
how
often
i
have
condemned
as
too
silly
to
repeat
things
which
reporting
mothers
evidently
regarded
as
proofs
of
a
stupendous
intellect
but
the
folly
of
these
constitutes
the
chief
part
of
their
merit
and
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
be
mistaken
for
supposing
them
clever
except
it
be
in
regard
of
a
glimmer
of
purpose
now
and
then
and
the
occasional
manifestation
of
the
cunning
of
the
stump
orator
with
his
subterfuges
to
conceal
his
embarrassment
when
he
finds
his
oil
failing
him
and
his
lamp
burning
low
chapter
xl
child
nonsense
one
word
of
introductory
explanation
during
my
husband
illness
marion
came
often
but
until
he
began
to
recover
would
generally
spend
with
the
children
the
whole
of
the
time
she
had
to
spare
not
even
permitting
me
to
know
that
she
was
in
the
house
it
was
a
great
thing
for
them
for
although
they
were
well
enough
cared
for
they
were
necessarily
left
to
themselves
a
good
deal
more
than
hitherto
hence
perhaps
it
came
that
they
betook
themselves
to
an
amusement
not
uncommon
with
children
of
which
i
had
as
yet
seen
nothing
amongst
them
one
evening
when
my
husband
had
made
a
little
progress
towards
recovery
marion
came
to
sit
with
me
in
his
room
for
an
hour
i
brought
you
something
i
want
to
read
to
you
she
said
if
you
think
percivale
can
bear
it
i
told
her
i
believed
he
could
and
she
proceeded
to
explain
what
it
was
one
morning
when
i
went
into
the
nursery
i
found
the
children
playing
at
church
or
rather
at
preaching
for
except
a
few
minutes
of
singing
the
preaching
occupied
the
whole
time
there
were
two
clergymen
ernest
and
charles
alternately
incumbent
and
curate
the
chief
duty
of
the
curate
for
the
time
being
was
to
lend
his
aid
to
the
rescue
of
his
incumbent
from
any
difficulty
in
which
the
extemporaneous
character
of
his
discourse
might
land
him
i
interrupt
marion
to
mention
that
the
respective
ages
of
ernest
and
charles
were
then
eight
and
six
the
pulpit
she
continued
was
on
the
top
of
the
cupboard
under
the
and
consisted
of
a
chair
and
a
cushion
there
were
in
abundance
of
which
neither
of
them
i
am
happy
to
say
made
other
than
a
pretended
use
for
reference
charles
indeed
who
was
preaching
when
i
entered
read
but
both
have
far
too
much
reverence
to
use
sacred
words
in
their
games
as
the
sermons
themselves
will
instance
i
took
down
almost
every
word
they
said
frequent
embarrassments
and
interruptions
enabling
me
to
do
so
ernest
was
acting
as
clerk
and
occasionally
prompted
the
speaker
when
his
eloquence
failed
him
or
reproved
members
of
the
congregation
which
consisted
of
the
two
nurses
and
the
other
children
who
were
inattentive
charles
spoke
with
a
good
deal
of
and
had
quite
a
professional
air
when
he
looked
down
on
the
big
open
book
referred
to
one
or
other
of
the
smaller
ones
at
his
side
or
directed
looks
of
reprehension
at
this
or
that
hearer
you
would
have
thought
he
had
cultivated
the
imitation
of
popular
preachers
whereas
he
tells
me
he
has
been
to
church
only
three
times
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
give
the
opening
remarks
for
i
lost
them
by
being
late
but
what
i
did
hear
was
this
she
then
read
from
her
paper
as
follows
and
lent
it
me
afterwards
i
merely
copy
it
once
was
proceeding
when
marion
there
lived
an
aged
man
and
another
who
was
a
aged
man
and
the
very
aged
man
was
going
to
die
and
every
one
but
the
aged
man
thought
the
other
the
aged
man
would
die
i
do
this
to
it
to
you
he
the
man
who
was
going
to
die
was
i
will
look
in
the
dictionary
looks
in
the
book
and
gives
out
with
much
was
two
thousand
and
years
old
well
the
other
man
was
well
then
the
other
man
knew
he
was
going
to
die
was
about
four
thousand
and
two
not
nearly
so
old
you
see
charles
whispers
with
ernest
and
then
announces
very
this
is
out
of
james
the
aged
man
had
a
wife
and
no
children
and
the
other
had
no
wife
but
a
children
the
fact
was
was
how
it
was
the
wife
and
so
had
the
children
well
the
man
i
spoke
of
first
well
he
died
in
the
middle
of
the
night
look
as
much
as
to
say
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
an
nobody
but
the
aged
man
knew
he
was
going
to
die
well
in
the
morning
when
his
wife
got
up
she
spoke
to
him
and
he
was
dead
perfectly
sure
enough
with
a
change
of
voice
and
he
was
really
dead
because
you
know
and
shut
the
door
you
know
where
he
went
because
in
the
morning
next
day
pauses
and
looks
round
ernest
out
of
a
book
the
angels
take
him
away
came
the
angels
to
take
him
away
up
to
where
you
know
solemn
he
resumes
quickly
with
a
change
of
they
all
the
rest
died
of
grief
now
you
must
expect
as
they
all
died
of
grief
that
lots
of
angels
must
have
come
to
take
away
freddy
go
when
the
sermon
is
over
that
such
a
bother
at
this
point
marion
paused
in
her
reading
and
resumed
the
narrative
form
freddy
however
was
too
much
for
them
so
ernest
betook
himself
to
the
organ
which
was
a
chest
of
drawers
the
drawers
doing
duty
as
stops
while
freddy
went
up
to
the
pulpit
to
say
and
shake
hands
for
which
he
was
mildly
reproved
by
both
his
brothers
my
husband
and
i
were
so
much
amused
that
marion
said
she
had
another
sermon
also
preached
by
charles
on
the
same
day
after
a
short
interval
and
at
our
request
she
read
it
here
it
is
once
upon
a
time
a
long
while
ago
in
a
little
ready
now
well
there
lived
in
a
rather
big
house
with
clean
windows
it
was
in
winter
so
nobody
noticed
them
but
they
were
quite
they
were
so
clean
there
lived
some
angels
in
the
house
it
was
in
the
air
nobody
knew
why
but
it
did
no
i
do
think
it
did
i
dunno
but
there
lived
in
it
lots
of
children
two
hundred
and
and
they
oh
i
distracted
it
is
too
bad
is
their
mother
and
father
had
died
but
they
were
very
rich
now
you
see
what
a
heap
of
children
two
hundred
and
and
yet
it
seemed
like
to
them
they
were
so
rich
was
it
it
seemed
like
to
them
because
they
were
so
rich
now
the
children
knew
what
to
get
and
explain
to
you
now
they
knew
and
is
how
they
knew
the
angels
came
down
on
the
earth
and
told
them
their
mother
had
sent
messages
to
them
and
their
mother
and
father
talk
i
gettin
extracted
his
hand
to
his
head
in
a
frenzied
now
my
brother
severely
to
a
still
inattentive
i
tell
you
what
the
angels
told
them
what
to
get
what
how
now
i
will
tell
you
how
yes
they
knew
what
they
were
to
eat
well
the
fact
was
that
just
towards
my
face
and
he
laughing
i
going
to
explain
the
mother
and
father
had
the
wings
on
and
so
of
course
ernest
i
want
you
they
were
he
and
she
angels
and
they
told
them
what
to
have
well
one
thing
was
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
was
look
at
two
hundred
and
two
in
another
book
one
thing
was
a
leg
of
mutton
of
course
as
the
mother
and
father
were
angels
they
had
to
fly
up
again
now
i
going
to
explain
how
they
got
it
done
they
had
four
servants
and
one
cook
so
that
would
be
five
well
this
cook
did
them
the
eldest
girl
was
sixteen
and
her
name
was
snowdrop
because
she
had
snowy
arms
and
cheeks
and
was
a
very
nice
girl
the
eldest
boy
was
seventeen
and
his
name
was
john
he
always
told
the
cook
what
they
have
no
the
girl
did
that
and
the
boy
was
now
grown
up
so
they
would
be
mother
and
father
of
dissent
among
the
when
they
were
so
old
they
would
be
mother
and
father
and
master
of
the
servants
and
they
were
very
happy
they
did
quite
like
it
and
and
a
great
would
like
it
if
mother
were
to
die
and
i
end
it
next
sunday
let
us
sing
the
congregation
then
sung
locks
said
marion
and
dispersed
ernest
complaining
that
charley
gave
them
such
large
qualities
of
numbers
and
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
of
his
book
after
a
brief
interval
the
sermon
was
resumed
text
is
no
i
a
good
congregation
i
got
to
where
the
children
did
not
like
it
without
their
mother
and
father
well
you
must
remember
this
was
a
long
while
ago
so
what
i
going
to
speak
about
be
possible
well
their
house
was
on
the
top
of
a
high
and
steep
hill
and
at
the
bottom
a
little
from
the
hill
was
a
knight
house
there
were
three
knights
living
in
it
next
to
it
was
stables
with
three
horses
in
it
sometimes
they
went
up
to
this
house
and
wondered
what
was
in
it
never
knew
but
saw
the
angels
come
the
knights
were
out
all
day
and
only
came
home
for
meals
and
they
wondered
what
the
angels
were
doin
goin
in
the
house
they
found
out
what
and
the
question
was
i
explain
what
it
was
ernest
come
here
remarks
to
the
i
curate
to
well
but
charles
going
to
explain
you
know
charles
the
fact
was
that
this
was
if
you
like
to
explain
it
more
to
yourselves
you
better
look
in
your
books
no
before
the
angels
did
speak
loud
so
the
knights
could
hear
they
spoke
louder
so
that
the
knights
could
visit
them
they
knew
their
names
they
had
many
visitors
but
they
had
the
knights
in
there
and
that
all
i
am
still
very
much
afraid
that
all
this
nonsense
will
hardly
be
interesting
even
to
parents
but
i
may
as
well
suffer
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
and
as
i
had
an
opportunity
of
hearing
two
such
sermons
myself
not
long
after
i
shall
give
them
trusting
they
will
occupy
far
less
space
in
print
than
they
do
in
my
foolish
heart
it
was
ernest
who
was
in
the
pulpit
and
just
commencing
his
discourse
when
i
entered
the
nursery
and
sat
down
with
the
congregation
sheltered
by
a
apparently
set
up
for
a
screen
i
took
out
my
pencil
and
reported
on
a
of
the
book
i
had
been
reading
my
brother
was
goin
to
preach
about
the
wicked
i
will
preach
about
the
good
day
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
there
was
a
very
old
house
it
was
so
old
that
it
was
pulled
down
and
a
quite
new
one
was
built
instead
some
people
who
lived
in
it
did
not
like
it
so
much
now
as
they
did
when
it
was
old
i
take
their
part
you
know
and
think
they
were
quite
right
in
preferring
the
old
one
to
the
ugly
bare
new
one
they
left
it
sold
it
and
got
into
another
old
house
instead
here
i
am
sorry
to
say
his
curate
interjected
the
scornful
remark
he
not
lookin
in
the
book
a
bit
but
the
preacher
went
on
without
heeding
the
attack
on
his
orthodoxy
this
other
old
house
was
still
more
uncomfortable
it
was
very
draughty
the
gutters
were
always
leaking
and
they
wished
themselves
back
in
the
new
house
so
you
see
if
you
wish
for
a
better
thing
you
do
get
it
so
good
after
all
ernest
that
about
the
bad
after
all
cried
charles
well
it
remarked
freddy
severely
but
i
wrote
it
myself
pleaded
the
preacher
from
the
pulpit
and
in
consideration
of
the
fact
he
was
allowed
to
go
on
i
was
reading
about
them
being
always
uncomfortable
at
last
they
decided
to
go
back
to
their
own
house
which
they
had
sold
they
had
to
pay
so
much
to
get
it
back
that
they
had
hardly
any
money
left
and
then
they
got
so
unhappy
and
the
husband
whipped
his
wife
and
took
to
drinking
that
a
lesson
the
preacher
voice
became
very
that
a
lesson
to
show
you
should
try
to
get
the
better
thing
for
it
turns
out
worse
and
then
you
get
sadder
and
every
thing
he
paused
evidently
too
mournful
to
proceed
freddy
again
remarked
that
it
was
but
charles
interposed
a
word
for
the
preacher
it
a
good
i
think
a
good
i
say
he
repeated
as
if
he
would
not
be
supposed
to
consider
it
much
of
a
sermon
but
here
the
preacher
recovered
himself
and
summed
up
see
how
it
comes
wanting
to
get
every
thing
you
come
to
the
bad
and
drinking
and
i
think
i
leave
off
here
let
us
sing
the
song
was
little
robin
redbreast
during
which
charles
remarked
to
freddy
apparently
by
way
of
pressing
home
the
lesson
upon
his
younger
brother
fancy
floggin
his
wife
then
he
got
into
the
pulpit
himself
and
commenced
an
oration
chapter
well
the
time
when
the
story
was
was
about
herod
there
were
some
wicked
people
wanderin
about
there
and
they
not
them
you
know
but
went
to
the
judge
we
shall
see
what
they
did
to
them
i
tell
you
this
to
make
you
understand
now
the
story
begins
but
i
must
think
a
little
ernest
let
sing
first
i
saw
your
face
when
the
wicked
man
was
taken
then
to
the
good
judge
there
were
good
people
when
i
said
i
was
going
to
preach
about
the
wicked
i
did
not
mean
that
there
were
no
good
only
a
good
lot
of
wicked
there
were
pleacemans
about
here
and
they
put
him
in
prison
for
a
few
days
and
then
the
judge
could
see
about
what
he
is
to
do
with
him
at
the
end
of
the
few
days
the
judge
asked
him
if
he
would
stay
in
prison
for
life
or
be
hanged
here
arose
some
inquiries
among
the
congregation
as
to
what
the
wicked
of
whom
the
prisoner
was
one
had
done
that
was
wrong
to
which
charles
replied
oh
they
murdered
and
killed
they
stealed
and
they
were
very
wicked
altogether
well
he
went
on
resuming
his
discourse
the
morning
came
and
the
judge
said
the
ropes
and
my
throne
and
order
the
people
to
come
to
see
the
hangin
for
the
man
was
decided
to
be
hanged
now
the
people
come
they
were
the
wicked
and
they
would
in
comin
they
were
the
wicked
and
if
that
was
the
the
judge
must
do
something
to
them
chapter
we
have
some
singin
while
i
think
yankee
doodle
was
accordingly
sung
with
much
enthusiasm
and
solemnity
then
charles
resumed
well
they
had
to
put
the
other
people
who
persisted
in
coming
in
prison
till
the
man
who
murdered
people
was
hanged
i
think
my
brother
will
go
on
he
descended
and
gave
place
to
ernest
who
began
with
vigor
we
were
reading
about
herod
were
we
then
the
wicked
people
come
and
had
to
be
put
to
death
they
were
on
the
man
side
and
they
all
called
out
that
he
had
had
his
wish
before
he
died
as
they
did
in
those
days
so
of
course
he
wished
for
his
life
and
of
course
the
judge
let
him
have
wish
and
so
he
wished
to
speak
to
his
friends
and
they
let
him
and
the
nasty
wicked
people
took
him
away
and
he
was
never
seen
in
that
country
any
more
and
that
enough
i
think
let
us
sing
lovel
he
stood
at
his
a
combing
his
steed
at
the
conclusion
of
this
mournful
ballad
the
congregation
was
allowed
to
disperse
but
before
they
had
gone
far
they
were
recalled
by
the
offer
of
a
more
secular
entertainment
from
charles
who
the
pulpit
and
delivered
himself
as
follows
well
the
play
is
called
not
a
proverb
or
a
charade
it
is
it
a
play
called
birds
and
the
babies
well
once
there
was
a
little
cottage
and
lots
of
little
babies
in
it
nobody
knew
who
the
babies
were
they
were
so
happy
now
i
ca
explain
it
to
you
how
they
came
together
they
had
no
father
and
mother
but
they
were
brothers
and
sisters
they
never
and
they
did
like
it
now
would
like
to
would
you
they
had
a
little
garden
and
saw
a
great
many
birds
in
the
trees
they
happy
but
happy
that
a
funny
thing
now
the
wicked
fairies
made
them
unhappy
and
the
good
fairies
made
them
happy
they
gave
them
lots
of
toys
but
then
how
they
got
their
living
chapter
second
called
babies
at
play
the
fairies
told
them
what
to
get
was
it
and
so
they
got
their
living
very
nicely
and
now
i
must
explain
what
they
played
with
first
was
a
house
another
dolls
they
were
very
happy
and
felt
as
if
they
had
a
mother
and
father
but
they
had
and
make
it
out
make
it
out
they
had
little
pumps
and
trees
then
they
had
babies
rattles
oh
i
said
hardly
any
thing
about
the
birds
have
i
an
called
birds
and
the
babies
they
had
lots
of
little
pretty
robins
and
canaries
hanging
round
the
ceiling
and
i
say
every
one
listened
expectant
during
the
pause
that
followed
and
lived
happy
ever
the
puzzle
in
it
all
is
chiefly
what
my
husband
hinted
at
why
and
how
both
the
desire
and
the
means
of
utterance
should
so
long
precede
the
possession
of
any
thing
ripe
for
utterance
i
suspect
the
answer
must
lie
pretty
deep
in
some
metaphysical
gulf
or
other
at
the
same
time
the
struggle
to
speak
where
there
is
so
little
to
utter
can
hardly
fail
to
suggest
the
thought
of
some
efforts
of
a
more
pretentious
and
imposing
character
but
more
than
enough
chapter
xli
double
double
toil
and
trouble
i
had
for
a
day
or
two
fancied
that
marion
was
looking
less
bright
than
usual
as
if
some
little
shadow
had
fallen
upon
the
morning
of
her
life
i
say
because
although
marion
must
now
have
been
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
her
life
had
always
seemed
to
me
lighted
by
a
cool
clear
dewy
morning
sun
over
whose
face
it
now
seemed
as
if
some
film
of
noonday
cloud
had
begun
to
gather
unwilling
at
once
to
assert
the
ultimate
privilege
of
friendship
i
asked
her
if
any
thing
was
amiss
with
her
friends
she
answered
that
all
was
going
on
well
at
least
so
far
that
she
had
no
special
anxiety
about
any
of
them
encouraged
by
a
and
more
than
smile
i
ventured
a
little
farther
i
am
afraid
there
is
something
troubling
you
i
said
there
is
she
replied
something
troubling
me
a
good
deal
but
i
hope
it
will
pass
away
soon
the
sigh
which
followed
however
was
deep
though
gentle
and
seemed
to
indicate
a
fear
that
the
trouble
might
not
pass
away
so
very
soon
i
am
not
to
ask
you
any
questions
i
suppose
i
returned
better
not
at
present
she
answered
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
she
paused
several
moments
before
finishing
her
sentence
then
added
that
i
am
at
liberty
to
tell
you
about
it
then
do
say
another
word
i
rejoined
only
when
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
you
let
me
wo
you
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
i
afraid
it
may
be
some
fault
of
mine
she
said
i
do
know
i
tell
i
do
understand
such
things
she
sighed
again
and
held
her
peace
it
was
enigmatical
enough
one
thing
only
was
clear
that
at
present
i
was
not
wanted
so
i
too
held
my
peace
and
in
a
few
minutes
marion
went
with
a
more
affectionate
than
usual
for
her
friendship
was
far
less
demonstrative
than
that
of
most
women
i
pondered
but
it
was
not
of
much
use
of
course
the
first
thing
that
suggested
itself
was
could
my
angel
be
in
love
and
with
some
mortal
mere
the
very
idea
was
a
shock
simply
from
its
strangeness
of
course
being
a
woman
she
be
in
love
but
the
two
ideas
and
refused
to
coalesce
and
again
was
it
likely
that
such
as
she
her
mind
occupied
with
so
many
other
absorbing
interests
would
fall
in
love
unprovoked
unsolicited
that
indeed
was
not
likely
then
if
solicited
she
but
returned
love
for
love
why
was
she
sad
the
new
experience
might
it
is
true
cause
such
commotion
in
a
mind
like
hers
as
to
trouble
her
greatly
she
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
nor
where
to
accommodate
her
new
inmate
so
as
to
keep
him
from
meddling
with
affairs
he
had
no
right
to
meddle
with
it
was
easy
enough
to
fancy
him
troublesome
in
a
house
like
hers
but
surely
of
all
women
might
be
able
to
meet
her
own
liabilities
and
if
this
were
all
why
should
she
have
said
she
hoped
it
would
soon
pass
that
might
however
mean
only
that
she
hoped
soon
to
get
her
guest
brought
amenable
to
her
existing
household
economy
there
was
yet
a
conjecture
however
which
seemed
to
suit
the
case
better
if
marion
knew
little
of
what
is
commonly
called
love
that
is
the
attraction
of
correlative
unlikeness
as
i
once
heard
it
defined
by
a
metaphysical
friend
of
my
father
there
was
no
one
who
knew
more
of
the
tenderness
of
compassion
than
she
and
was
it
not
possible
some
one
might
be
wanting
to
marry
her
to
whom
she
could
not
give
herself
away
this
conjecture
was
at
least
ample
enough
to
cover
the
facts
in
my
possession
which
were
scanty
indeed
in
number
hardly
dual
but
who
was
there
to
dare
offer
love
to
my
saint
roger
pooh
pooh
blackstone
ah
i
had
seen
him
once
lately
looking
at
her
with
an
expression
of
more
than
ordinary
admiration
but
what
man
that
knew
any
thing
of
her
could
help
looking
at
her
with
such
an
admiration
if
it
was
blackstone
why
might
dare
yes
why
should
he
not
dare
to
love
her
especially
if
he
could
help
it
as
of
course
he
could
was
he
not
one
whose
love
simply
because
he
was
a
man
from
the
heart
to
the
hands
would
honor
any
woman
even
saint
clare
as
she
must
be
when
the
church
has
learned
to
do
its
business
without
the
pope
only
he
must
blame
me
if
after
all
i
should
think
he
offered
less
than
he
sought
or
her
if
entertaining
no
question
of
worth
whatever
she
should
yet
refuse
to
listen
to
him
as
truly
there
was
more
than
a
possibility
she
might
if
it
were
blackstone
certainly
i
knew
no
man
who
could
understand
her
better
or
whose
modes
of
thinking
and
working
would
more
thoroughly
fall
in
with
her
own
true
he
was
peculiar
that
is
he
had
kept
the
angles
of
his
individuality
for
all
the
grinding
of
the
social
mill
his
manners
were
too
abrupt
and
drove
at
the
heart
of
things
too
directly
seldom
suggesting
a
to
those
whose
prejudices
he
overturned
true
also
that
his
person
though
dignified
was
somewhat
ungainly
with
an
ungainliness
however
which
i
could
well
imagine
a
wife
learning
absolutely
to
love
but
on
the
whole
the
thing
was
reasonable
only
what
would
become
of
her
friends
there
i
could
hardly
doubt
there
lay
the
difficulty
ay
was
the
rub
let
no
one
think
when
i
say
we
went
to
blackstone
church
the
next
sunday
that
it
had
any
thing
to
do
with
these
speculations
we
often
went
on
the
first
sunday
of
the
month
what
the
matter
with
blackstone
said
my
husband
as
we
came
home
what
do
think
is
the
matter
with
him
i
returned
i
do
know
he
was
himself
i
thought
he
was
more
than
himself
i
rejoined
for
i
never
heard
even
read
the
litany
with
such
fervor
in
some
of
the
petitions
said
percivale
it
amounted
to
a
suppressed
agony
of
supplication
i
am
certain
he
is
in
trouble
i
told
him
my
suspicions
likely
very
likely
he
answered
and
became
thoughtful
but
you
do
think
she
refused
him
he
said
at
length
if
he
ever
asked
her
i
returned
i
fear
she
did
for
she
is
plainly
in
trouble
too
she
never
stick
to
it
he
said
you
must
judge
marion
by
ordinary
standards
i
replied
you
must
remember
she
has
not
only
found
her
vocation
but
for
many
years
proved
it
i
never
knew
her
turned
aside
from
what
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
i
can
hardly
imagine
her
forsaking
her
friends
to
keep
house
for
any
man
even
if
she
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
she
is
dedicated
as
irrevocably
as
any
nun
and
will
with
paul
cling
to
the
right
of
yet
what
great
difficulty
would
there
be
in
combining
the
two
sets
of
duties
especially
with
such
a
man
as
blackstone
of
all
the
men
i
know
he
comes
the
nearest
to
her
in
his
devotion
to
the
of
humanity
especially
of
the
poor
did
you
ever
know
a
man
with
such
a
plentiful
lack
of
condescension
his
feeling
of
human
equality
amounts
almost
to
a
fault
for
surely
he
ought
sometimes
to
speak
as
knowing
better
than
they
to
whom
he
speaks
he
forgets
that
too
many
will
but
use
his
humility
for
mortar
to
build
withal
the
of
their
own
superiority
that
may
be
yet
it
remains
impossible
for
him
to
assume
any
thing
he
is
the
same
all
through
and
i
had
almost
said
worthy
of
saint
clare
well
they
must
settle
it
for
themselves
we
can
do
nothing
we
can
do
nothing
he
assented
and
although
we
repeatedly
reverted
to
the
subject
on
the
long
way
home
we
carried
no
conclusions
to
a
different
result
towards
evening
of
the
same
sunday
roger
came
to
accompany
us
as
i
thought
to
marion
gathering
but
as
it
turned
out
only
to
tell
me
he
could
go
i
expressed
my
regret
and
asked
him
why
he
gave
me
no
answer
and
his
lip
trembled
a
sudden
conviction
seized
me
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
but
could
only
say
dear
roger
he
turned
his
head
aside
and
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
laid
his
forehead
on
his
hand
i
so
sorry
i
said
she
has
told
you
then
he
murmured
no
one
has
told
me
any
thing
he
was
silent
i
sat
down
beside
him
it
was
all
i
could
do
after
a
moment
he
rose
saying
there
no
good
whining
about
it
only
she
might
have
made
a
man
of
me
but
she
quite
right
it
a
comfort
to
think
i
so
unworthy
of
her
that
all
the
consolation
left
me
but
there
more
in
that
than
you
would
think
till
you
try
it
he
attempted
to
laugh
but
made
a
miserable
failure
of
it
then
rose
and
caught
up
his
hat
to
go
i
rose
also
roger
i
said
i
ca
go
and
leave
you
miserable
we
go
somewhere
else
anywhere
you
please
only
you
must
leave
us
i
do
want
to
go
somewhere
else
i
do
know
the
place
he
added
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
his
usual
gayety
stop
at
home
then
and
tell
me
all
about
it
it
will
do
you
good
to
talk
you
shall
have
your
pipe
and
you
shall
tell
me
just
as
much
as
you
like
and
keep
the
rest
to
yourself
if
you
want
to
get
hold
of
a
man
deepest
confidence
tell
him
to
smoke
in
your
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
there
seems
no
trouble
in
which
a
man
ca
smoke
one
who
scorns
extraneous
comfort
of
every
other
sort
will
yet
in
the
profoundest
sorrow
take
kindly
to
his
pipe
this
is
more
wonderful
than
any
thing
i
know
about
our
kind
but
i
fear
the
will
drive
many
women
to
tobacco
i
ran
to
percivale
gave
him
a
hint
of
how
it
was
and
demanded
his
pipe
and
directly
telling
him
he
must
content
himself
with
a
cigar
thus
armed
with
the
calumet
as
paddy
might
say
i
returned
to
roger
who
took
it
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
began
to
fill
it
mechanically
but
not
therefore
the
less
carefully
i
sat
down
laid
my
hands
in
my
lap
and
looked
at
him
without
a
word
when
the
pipe
was
filled
i
rose
and
got
him
a
light
for
which
also
he
made
me
no
acknowledgment
the
revenge
of
putting
it
in
print
is
sweet
having
whiffed
a
good
many
whiffs
in
silence
he
took
at
length
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
as
he
pressed
the
burning
tobacco
with
a
forefinger
said
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
wynnie
not
more
than
a
gentleman
had
a
right
to
do
i
will
pledge
myself
i
returned
she
told
you
then
he
said
once
more
looking
rather
disappointed
than
annoyed
no
one
has
mentioned
your
name
to
me
roger
i
only
guessed
it
from
what
marion
said
when
i
questioned
her
about
her
sad
looks
her
sad
looks
yes
what
did
she
say
he
asked
eagerly
she
only
confessed
she
had
had
something
to
trouble
her
and
said
she
hoped
it
would
be
over
soon
i
dare
say
returned
roger
dryly
looking
gratified
however
for
a
moment
my
reader
may
wonder
that
i
should
compromise
marion
even
so
far
as
to
confess
that
she
was
troubled
but
i
could
not
bear
that
roger
should
think
she
had
been
telling
his
story
to
me
every
generous
woman
feels
that
she
owes
the
man
she
refuses
at
least
silence
and
a
man
may
well
reckon
upon
that
much
favor
of
all
failures
why
should
this
be
known
to
the
world
the
relief
of
finding
she
had
not
betrayed
him
helped
him
i
think
to
open
his
mind
was
under
no
obligation
to
silence
you
see
wynnie
he
said
with
pauses
and
puffs
at
his
pipe
i
mean
i
a
fool
for
falling
in
love
with
marion
not
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
would
have
argued
me
a
beast
being
a
man
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
help
it
after
what
she
been
to
me
but
i
was
worse
than
a
fool
to
open
my
mouth
on
the
subject
to
an
angel
like
her
only
there
again
i
could
that
is
i
had
the
strength
to
help
it
i
beg
however
you
wo
think
me
such
a
downright
idiot
as
to
fancy
myself
worthy
of
her
in
that
case
i
should
have
deserved
as
much
scorn
as
she
gave
me
kindness
if
you
ask
me
how
it
was
then
that
i
dared
to
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
i
can
only
answer
that
i
yielded
to
the
impulse
common
to
all
kinds
of
love
to
make
itself
known
if
you
love
god
you
are
not
content
with
his
knowing
it
even
but
you
must
tell
him
as
if
he
did
know
it
you
may
think
from
this
cool
talk
of
mine
that
i
am
very
philosophical
about
it
but
there
are
lulls
in
every
storm
and
i
am
in
one
of
those
lulls
else
i
should
be
sitting
here
with
you
dear
roger
i
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
your
disappointment
somehow
i
ca
be
sorry
you
should
have
loved
loved
he
murmured
marion
then
i
went
on
that
can
do
you
nothing
but
good
and
in
itself
must
raise
you
above
yourself
and
how
could
i
blame
you
that
loving
her
you
wanted
her
to
know
it
but
come
now
if
you
can
trust
me
tell
me
all
about
it
and
especially
what
she
said
to
you
i
dare
not
give
you
any
hope
for
i
am
not
in
her
confidence
in
this
matter
and
it
is
well
that
i
am
not
for
then
i
might
not
be
able
to
talk
to
you
about
it
with
any
freedom
to
confess
the
real
truth
i
do
not
see
much
likelihood
knowing
her
as
i
do
that
she
will
recall
her
decision
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
decision
said
roger
you
would
not
have
thought
from
the
way
she
took
it
there
was
any
thing
to
decide
about
no
more
there
was
and
i
thought
i
knew
it
only
i
could
be
quiet
to
think
you
know
a
thing
and
to
know
it
are
two
very
different
matters
however
but
i
do
repent
having
spoken
my
mind
if
i
am
humbled
i
am
not
humiliated
if
she
listened
to
me
i
fear
i
should
have
been
ruined
by
pride
i
should
never
have
judged
myself
justly
after
it
i
humble
though
i
thought
i
was
i
a
poor
creature
ethelwyn
not
too
poor
a
creature
to
be
dearly
loved
roger
but
go
on
and
tell
me
all
about
it
as
your
friend
and
sister
i
am
anxious
to
hear
the
whole
notwithstanding
what
i
had
said
i
was
not
moved
by
sympathetic
curiosity
alone
but
also
by
the
vague
desire
of
rendering
some
help
beyond
comfort
what
he
had
now
said
greatly
heightened
my
opinion
of
him
and
thereby
in
my
thoughts
of
the
two
lessened
the
distance
between
him
and
marion
at
all
events
by
hearing
the
whole
i
should
learn
how
better
to
comfort
him
and
he
did
tell
me
the
whole
which
along
with
what
i
learned
afterwards
from
marion
i
will
set
down
as
nearly
as
i
can
throwing
it
into
the
form
of
direct
narration
i
will
not
pledge
myself
for
the
accuracy
of
every
trifling
particular
which
that
form
may
render
it
necessary
to
introduce
neither
i
am
sure
having
thus
explained
will
my
reader
demand
it
of
me
chapter
xlii
roger
and
marion
during
an
all
but
sleepless
night
roger
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
see
marion
not
certainly
for
the
first
time
for
he
had
again
and
again
ventured
to
call
upon
her
but
hitherto
he
had
always
had
some
pretext
sufficient
to
veil
his
deeper
reason
and
happily
or
unhappily
sufficient
also
to
prevent
her
in
her
more
than
ordinary
simplicity
with
regard
to
such
matters
from
suspecting
one
under
it
she
was
at
home
and
received
him
with
her
usual
kindness
feeling
that
he
must
not
let
an
awkward
silence
intervene
lest
she
should
become
suspicious
of
his
object
and
thus
the
chance
be
lost
of
interesting
and
possibly
moving
her
before
she
saw
his
drift
he
spoke
at
once
i
want
to
tell
you
something
miss
clare
he
said
as
lightly
as
he
could
well
she
returned
with
the
sweet
smile
which
graced
her
every
approach
to
communication
did
my
sister
in
law
ever
tell
you
what
an
idle
fellow
i
used
to
be
certainly
not
i
never
heard
her
say
a
word
of
you
that
was
kind
that
i
am
sure
of
but
there
would
have
been
no
unkindness
in
saying
that
for
an
idle
fellow
i
was
and
the
idler
because
i
was
conceited
enough
to
believe
i
could
do
any
thing
i
actually
thought
at
one
time
i
could
play
the
violin
i
actually
made
an
impertinent
attempt
in
your
presence
one
evening
years
and
years
ago
i
wonder
if
you
remember
it
i
do
but
i
do
know
why
you
should
call
it
impertinent
anyhow
i
caught
a
look
on
your
face
that
cured
me
of
that
conceit
i
have
never
touched
the
creature
since
a
cremona
too
i
am
very
sorry
indeed
i
am
i
do
remember
do
you
think
you
could
have
played
a
false
note
nothing
more
likely
then
i
dare
say
i
made
an
ugly
face
one
ca
always
help
it
you
know
when
something
unexpected
happens
do
forgive
me
forgive
you
angel
cried
roger
but
instantly
checked
himself
afraid
of
reaching
his
mark
before
he
had
gathered
sufficient
momentum
to
pierce
it
i
thought
you
would
see
what
a
good
thing
it
was
for
me
i
wanted
to
thank
you
for
it
it
such
a
pity
you
did
go
on
though
progress
is
the
real
cure
for
an
overestimate
of
ourselves
the
fact
is
i
was
beginning
to
see
what
small
praise
there
is
in
doing
many
things
ill
and
nothing
well
i
wish
you
would
take
my
cremona
i
could
teach
you
the
a
b
c
of
it
well
enough
how
you
would
make
it
talk
that
be
something
to
live
for
to
hear
play
the
violin
ladies
do
nowadays
you
know
i
have
no
time
roger
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
be
your
pupil
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
out
of
the
question
of
course
it
is
only
i
wish
well
never
mind
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
was
leading
a
life
then
that
was
worth
leading
for
the
good
of
being
just
what
happens
one
time
full
of
right
feeling
and
impulse
and
the
next
a
prey
to
all
wrong
judgments
and
falsehoods
it
was
you
made
me
see
it
i
been
trying
to
get
put
right
for
a
long
time
now
i
afraid
of
seeming
to
talk
goody
but
you
will
know
what
i
mean
you
and
your
sunday
evenings
have
waked
me
up
to
know
what
i
am
and
what
i
ought
to
be
i
am
a
little
better
i
work
hard
now
i
used
to
work
only
by
fits
and
starts
ask
wynnie
dear
roger
i
do
need
to
ask
wynnie
about
any
thing
you
tell
me
i
can
take
your
word
for
it
just
as
well
as
hers
i
am
very
glad
if
i
have
been
of
any
use
to
you
it
is
a
great
honor
to
me
but
the
worst
of
it
is
i
could
be
content
without
letting
you
know
and
making
myself
miserable
i
do
understand
you
i
think
surely
there
can
be
no
harm
in
letting
me
know
what
makes
me
very
happy
how
it
should
make
you
miserable
i
imagine
because
i
ca
stop
there
i
driven
to
say
what
will
offend
you
if
it
does
make
you
hate
me
no
not
that
for
you
do
know
how
to
hate
but
you
must
think
me
the
most
conceited
and
presumptuous
fellow
you
ever
knew
i
not
that
though
i
not
that
it
not
me
i
ca
help
it
i
help
loving
you
dreadfully
and
it
such
impudence
to
think
of
you
and
me
in
one
thought
and
yet
i
ca
help
it
o
miss
clare
do
drive
me
away
from
you
he
fell
on
his
knees
as
he
spoke
and
laid
his
head
on
her
lap
sobbing
like
a
child
who
had
offended
his
mother
he
almost
cried
again
as
he
told
me
this
marion
half
started
to
her
feet
in
confusion
almost
in
terror
for
she
had
never
seen
such
emotion
in
a
man
but
the
divine
compassion
of
her
nature
conquered
she
sat
down
again
took
his
head
in
her
hands
and
began
stroking
his
hair
as
if
she
were
indeed
a
mother
seeking
to
soothe
and
comfort
her
troubled
child
she
was
the
first
to
speak
again
for
roger
could
not
command
himself
i
very
sorry
roger
she
said
i
must
be
to
blame
somehow
to
blame
he
cried
lifting
up
his
head
to
blame
for
my
folly
but
it
not
folly
he
added
impetuously
it
would
be
downright
stupidity
not
to
love
you
with
all
my
soul
hush
hush
said
marion
in
whose
ears
his
language
sounded
irreverent
you
love
me
with
all
your
soul
if
you
would
god
only
be
loved
with
all
the
power
of
the
human
soul
if
i
love
him
at
all
marion
it
is
you
who
have
taught
me
do
not
drive
me
from
you
lest
lest
i
should
cease
to
love
him
and
fall
back
into
my
old
dreary
ways
it
a
poor
love
to
offer
god
love
for
the
sake
of
another
she
said
very
solemnly
but
if
it
all
one
has
got
then
it
wo
do
roger
i
wish
you
loved
me
for
god
sake
instead
then
all
would
be
right
that
would
be
a
grand
love
for
me
to
have
do
drive
me
from
you
marion
he
pleaded
it
was
all
he
could
say
i
will
not
drive
you
from
me
why
should
i
then
i
may
come
and
see
you
again
yes
when
you
please
you
mean
i
may
come
as
often
as
i
like
yes
when
i
have
time
to
see
you
then
cried
roger
starting
to
his
feet
with
clasped
hands
perhaps
is
it
possible
you
will
you
will
let
me
love
you
o
my
god
roger
said
marion
pale
as
death
and
rising
also
for
alas
the
sunshine
of
her
kindness
had
caused
hopes
to
blossom
whose
buds
she
had
taken
only
for
leaves
i
thought
you
understood
me
you
spoke
as
if
you
understood
perfectly
that
that
could
never
be
which
i
must
suppose
you
to
mean
of
course
it
can
not
i
am
not
my
own
to
keep
or
to
give
away
i
belong
to
this
people
my
friends
to
take
personal
and
private
duties
upon
me
would
be
to
abandon
them
and
how
dare
i
you
do
know
what
it
would
result
in
or
you
would
not
dream
of
it
were
i
to
do
such
a
thing
i
should
hate
and
despise
and
condemn
myself
with
utter
reprobation
and
then
what
a
prize
you
would
have
got
my
poor
roger
but
even
these
were
such
precious
words
to
hear
from
her
lips
he
fell
again
on
his
knees
before
her
as
she
stood
caught
her
hands
and
hiding
his
face
in
them
poured
forth
the
following
words
in
a
torrent
marion
do
not
think
me
so
selfish
as
not
to
have
thought
about
that
it
should
be
only
the
better
for
them
all
i
can
earn
quite
enough
for
you
and
me
too
and
so
you
would
have
the
more
time
to
give
to
them
i
should
never
have
dreamed
of
asking
you
to
leave
them
there
are
things
in
which
a
dog
may
help
a
man
doing
what
the
man
ca
do
there
may
be
things
in
which
a
man
might
help
an
angel
deeply
moved
by
the
unselfishness
of
his
love
marion
could
not
help
a
pressure
of
her
hands
against
the
face
which
had
sought
refuge
within
them
roger
fell
to
kissing
them
wildly
but
marion
was
a
woman
and
women
i
think
though
i
may
be
only
judging
by
myself
and
my
husband
look
forward
and
round
about
more
than
men
do
they
would
need
at
all
events
therefore
marion
saw
other
things
a
may
say
that
if
she
loved
him
she
would
not
have
thus
looked
about
her
and
that
if
she
did
not
love
him
there
was
no
occasion
for
her
thus
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
future
i
can
only
answer
that
it
is
allowed
on
all
hands
women
are
not
amenable
to
logic
look
about
her
marion
did
and
saw
that
as
a
married
woman
she
might
be
compelled
to
forsake
her
friends
more
or
less
for
there
might
arise
other
and
paramount
claims
on
her
in
a
word
if
she
were
to
have
children
she
would
have
no
choice
in
respect
to
whose
welfare
should
constitute
the
main
business
of
her
life
and
it
even
became
a
question
whether
she
would
have
a
right
to
place
them
in
circumstances
so
unfavorable
for
growth
and
education
therefore
to
marry
might
be
tantamount
to
forsaking
her
friends
but
where
was
the
need
of
any
such
mental
parley
of
course
she
marry
roger
how
could
she
marry
a
man
she
could
look
up
to
and
look
up
to
him
she
certainly
did
not
and
could
not
no
roger
she
said
this
last
thought
large
in
her
mind
and
as
she
spoke
she
withdrew
her
hands
it
must
be
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
ca
look
up
to
you
she
added
as
simply
as
a
child
i
should
think
not
he
burst
out
that
be
a
fine
thing
if
you
looked
up
to
a
fellow
like
me
i
think
it
would
almost
cure
me
of
looking
up
to
you
and
what
i
want
is
to
look
up
to
you
every
day
and
all
day
long
only
i
can
do
that
whether
you
let
me
or
not
but
i
do
choose
to
have
a
a
friend
to
whom
i
ca
look
up
then
i
shall
never
be
even
a
friend
he
returned
sadly
but
i
would
have
tried
hard
to
be
less
unworthy
of
you
at
this
precise
moment
marion
caught
sight
of
a
pair
of
great
round
blue
eyes
wide
open
under
a
shock
of
red
hair
about
three
feet
from
the
floor
staring
as
if
they
had
not
winked
for
the
last
ten
minutes
the
child
looked
so
comical
that
marion
reading
perhaps
in
her
looks
the
reflex
of
her
own
position
could
not
help
laughing
roger
started
up
in
dismay
but
beholding
the
apparition
laughed
also
please
grannie
said
the
urchin
mother
took
bad
and
want
ye
run
and
tell
your
mother
i
shall
be
with
her
directly
answered
marion
and
the
child
departed
you
told
me
i
might
come
again
pleaded
roger
better
not
i
did
know
what
it
would
mean
to
you
when
i
said
it
let
it
mean
what
you
meant
by
it
only
let
me
come
but
i
see
now
it
ca
mean
that
no
i
will
write
to
you
at
all
events
you
must
go
now
for
i
ca
stop
with
you
when
foote
do
make
me
wretched
marion
if
you
ca
love
me
do
kill
me
say
i
not
to
come
and
see
you
i
come
on
sundays
anyhow
the
next
day
came
the
following
letter
dear
roger
i
am
very
sorry
both
for
your
sake
and
my
own
that
i
did
not
speak
more
plainly
yesterday
i
was
so
distressed
for
you
and
my
heart
was
so
friendly
towards
you
that
i
could
hardly
think
of
any
thing
at
first
but
how
to
comfort
you
and
i
fear
i
allowed
you
after
all
to
go
away
with
the
idea
that
what
you
wished
was
not
altogether
impossible
but
indeed
it
is
if
even
i
loved
you
in
the
way
you
love
me
i
should
yet
make
every
thing
yield
to
the
duties
i
have
undertaken
in
listening
to
you
i
should
be
undermining
the
whole
of
my
past
labors
and
the
very
idea
of
becoming
less
of
a
friend
to
my
friends
is
horrible
to
me
but
much
as
i
esteem
you
and
much
pleasure
as
your
society
gives
me
the
idea
you
brought
before
me
yesterday
was
absolutely
startling
and
i
think
i
have
only
to
remind
you
as
i
have
just
done
of
the
peculiarities
of
my
position
to
convince
you
that
it
could
never
become
a
familiar
one
to
me
all
that
friendship
can
do
or
yield
you
may
ever
claim
of
me
and
i
thank
god
if
i
have
been
of
the
smallest
service
to
you
but
i
should
be
quite
unworthy
of
that
honor
were
i
for
any
reason
to
admit
even
the
thought
of
abandoning
the
work
which
has
been
growing
up
around
me
for
so
many
years
and
is
so
peculiarly
mine
that
it
could
be
transferred
to
no
one
else
believe
me
yours
most
truly
marion
clare
chapter
xliii
a
little
more
about
roger
and
about
blackstone
after
telling
me
the
greater
part
of
what
i
have
just
written
roger
handed
me
this
letter
to
read
as
we
sat
together
that
same
sunday
evening
it
seems
final
roger
i
said
with
an
interrogation
as
i
returned
it
to
him
of
course
it
is
he
replied
how
could
any
honest
man
urge
his
suit
after
that
after
she
says
that
to
grant
it
would
be
to
destroy
the
whole
of
her
previous
life
and
ruin
her
but
i
not
so
miserable
as
you
may
think
me
wynnie
he
went
on
for
do
you
see
though
i
could
quite
bring
myself
to
go
i
do
feel
cut
off
from
her
she
not
likely
if
i
know
her
to
listen
to
anybody
else
so
long
as
the
same
reasons
hold
for
which
she
would
give
me
a
chance
of
persuading
her
she
ca
help
me
loving
her
and
i
sure
she
let
me
help
her
when
i
the
luck
to
find
a
chance
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
keep
a
sharp
lookout
if
i
can
be
her
servant
that
will
be
something
yes
much
though
she
wo
give
herself
to
me
and
quite
right
too
why
should
she
god
bless
her
she
ca
prevent
me
from
giving
myself
to
her
so
long
as
i
may
love
her
and
see
her
as
often
as
i
do
doubt
i
may
and
things
continue
as
they
are
i
be
i
have
another
pipe
i
think
here
he
and
hurriedly
pulled
out
his
watch
i
declare
there
time
yet
he
cried
and
sprung
to
his
feet
let
go
and
hear
what
she
got
to
say
do
you
think
you
had
better
not
wo
you
put
her
out
i
suggested
if
i
understand
her
at
all
he
said
she
will
be
more
put
out
by
my
absence
for
she
will
fear
i
am
wretched
caring
only
for
herself
and
not
for
what
she
taught
me
you
may
come
or
stay
off
you
done
me
so
much
good
wynnie
he
added
looking
back
in
the
doorway
thank
you
a
thousand
times
there
no
comforter
like
a
sister
and
a
pipe
i
said
at
which
he
laughed
and
was
gone
when
percivale
and
i
reached
lime
court
having
followed
as
quickly
as
we
could
there
was
roger
sitting
in
the
midst
as
intent
on
her
words
as
if
she
had
been
an
old
prophet
and
marion
speaking
with
all
the
composure
which
naturally
belonged
to
her
when
she
shook
hands
with
him
after
the
service
a
slight
flush
washed
the
white
of
her
face
with
a
delicate
warmth
nothing
more
i
said
to
myself
however
as
we
went
home
and
afterwards
to
my
husband
that
his
case
was
not
a
desperate
one
but
what
to
become
of
blackstone
said
percivale
i
will
tell
my
reader
how
afterwards
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
fared
but
i
have
no
information
concerning
his
supposed
connection
with
this
part
of
my
story
i
can
not
even
be
sure
that
he
ever
was
in
love
with
marion
troubled
he
certainly
was
at
this
time
and
marion
continued
so
for
a
while
more
troubled
i
think
than
the
necessity
she
felt
upon
her
with
regard
to
roger
will
quite
account
for
if
however
she
had
to
make
two
men
miserable
in
one
week
that
might
well
cover
the
case
before
the
week
was
over
my
husband
received
a
note
from
blackstone
informing
him
that
he
was
just
about
to
start
for
a
few
weeks
on
the
continent
when
he
returned
i
was
satisfied
from
his
appearance
that
a
notable
change
had
passed
upon
him
a
certain
indescribable
serenity
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
his
whole
being
every
look
and
tone
indicated
a
mind
that
knew
more
than
tongue
could
utter
a
heart
that
had
had
glimpses
into
a
region
of
content
i
thought
of
the
words
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
and
my
heart
was
at
rest
about
him
he
had
fared
i
thought
as
the
child
who
has
had
a
hurt
but
is
taken
up
in
his
mother
arms
and
comforted
what
hurt
would
not
such
comforting
outweigh
to
the
child
and
who
but
he
that
has
had
the
worst
hurt
man
can
receive
and
the
best
comfort
god
can
give
can
tell
what
either
is
i
was
present
the
first
time
he
met
marion
after
his
return
she
was
a
little
embarrassed
he
showed
a
tender
dignity
a
respect
as
if
from
above
like
what
one
might
fancy
the
embodiment
of
the
love
of
a
wise
angel
for
such
a
woman
the
thought
of
comparing
the
two
had
never
before
occurred
to
me
but
now
for
the
moment
i
felt
as
if
blackstone
were
a
step
above
marion
plainly
i
had
no
occasion
to
be
troubled
about
either
of
them
on
the
supposition
that
marion
had
refused
him
i
argued
with
myself
that
it
could
not
have
been
on
the
ground
that
she
was
unable
to
look
up
to
him
and
notwithstanding
what
she
had
said
to
roger
i
was
satisfied
that
any
one
she
felt
she
could
help
to
be
a
nobler
creature
must
have
a
greatly
better
chance
of
rousing
all
the
woman
in
her
than
one
whom
she
must
regard
as
needing
no
aid
from
her
all
her
life
had
been
spent
in
serving
and
sheltering
human
beings
whose
condition
she
regarded
with
hopeful
compassion
could
she
now
help
adding
roger
to
her
number
of
such
and
if
she
once
looked
upon
him
thus
tenderly
was
it
not
at
least
very
possible
that
in
some
softer
mood
a
feeling
hitherto
unknown
to
her
might
surprise
her
consciousness
with
its
presence
floating
to
the
surface
of
her
sea
from
its
strange
depths
and
leaning
towards
him
with
the
outstretched
arms
of
embrace
but
i
dared
not
think
what
might
become
of
roger
should
his
divine
resolves
fail
should
the
frequent
society
of
marion
prove
insufficient
for
the
solace
and
quiet
of
his
heart
i
had
heard
how
men
will
seek
to
drown
sorrow
in
the
ruin
of
the
sorrowing
power
will
slay
themselves
that
they
may
cause
their
hurt
to
cease
and
i
trembled
for
my
husband
brother
but
the
days
went
on
and
i
saw
no
sign
of
failure
or
change
he
was
steady
at
his
work
and
came
to
see
us
as
constantly
as
before
never
missed
a
chance
of
meeting
marion
and
at
every
treat
she
gave
her
friends
whether
at
the
house
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
or
at
lady
bernard
in
the
neighborhood
of
london
whether
she
took
them
on
the
river
or
had
some
one
to
lecture
or
read
to
them
roger
was
always
at
hand
for
service
and
help
still
i
was
uneasy
for
might
there
not
come
a
collapse
especially
if
some
new
event
were
to
destroy
the
hope
which
he
still
cherished
and
which
i
feared
was
his
main
support
would
his
religion
then
prove
of
a
quality
and
power
sufficient
to
keep
him
from
drifting
away
with
the
receding
tide
of
his
hopes
and
imaginations
in
this
anxiety
perhaps
i
regarded
too
exclusively
the
faith
of
roger
and
thought
too
little
about
the
faith
of
god
however
this
may
be
i
could
not
rest
but
thought
and
thought
until
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
tell
lady
bernard
all
about
it
chapter
xliv
the
dea
ex
and
you
think
marion
likes
him
asked
lady
bernard
when
she
had
in
silence
heard
my
story
i
am
sure
she
him
but
you
know
he
is
so
far
inferior
to
her
in
every
way
how
do
you
know
that
questions
are
involved
there
which
no
one
but
god
can
determine
you
must
remember
that
both
are
growing
what
matter
if
any
two
are
unequal
at
a
given
moment
seeing
their
relative
positions
may
be
reversed
twenty
times
in
a
thousand
years
besides
i
doubt
very
much
if
any
one
who
brought
his
favors
with
him
would
have
the
least
chance
with
marion
poverty
to
turn
into
wealth
is
the
one
irresistible
attraction
for
her
and
however
duty
may
compel
her
to
act
my
impression
is
that
she
will
not
escape
roger
i
need
not
say
i
was
gratified
to
find
lady
bernard
conclusion
from
marion
character
run
parallel
with
my
own
but
what
can
come
of
it
i
said
why
marriage
i
hope
but
marion
would
as
soon
think
of
falling
down
and
worshipping
baal
and
ashtoreth
as
of
forsaking
her
grandchildren
doubtless
but
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
that
where
two
things
are
both
of
god
it
is
not
likely
they
will
be
found
mutually
obstructive
roger
does
declare
himself
quite
ready
to
go
and
live
amongst
her
friends
and
do
his
best
to
help
her
that
is
all
as
it
should
be
so
far
as
he
as
both
of
them
are
concerned
but
there
are
contingencies
and
the
question
naturally
arises
how
would
that
do
in
regard
of
their
children
if
i
could
imagine
marion
consenting
i
said
i
know
what
she
would
answer
to
that
question
she
would
say
why
should
her
children
be
better
off
than
the
children
about
them
she
would
say
that
the
children
must
share
the
life
and
work
of
their
parents
and
i
think
she
would
be
right
though
the
obvious
rejoinder
would
be
may
waive
your
own
social
privileges
and
sacrifice
yourselves
to
the
good
of
others
but
have
you
a
right
to
sacrifice
your
children
and
heap
disadvantages
on
their
future
now
give
us
the
answer
on
the
other
side
seeing
you
think
marion
would
be
right
after
all
marion
answer
would
i
think
be
that
their
children
would
be
children
and
he
could
desire
better
for
them
than
to
be
born
in
lowly
conditions
and
trained
from
the
first
to
give
themselves
to
the
service
of
their
fellows
seeing
that
in
so
far
their
history
would
resemble
that
of
his
own
son
our
saviour
in
sacrificing
their
earthly
future
as
men
would
call
it
their
parents
would
but
be
furthering
their
eternal
good
that
would
be
enough
in
regard
of
such
objections
but
there
would
be
a
previous
one
on
marion
own
part
how
would
her
new
position
affect
her
ministrations
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
think
lady
bernard
replied
that
what
her
friends
would
lose
thereby
i
mean
what
amount
of
her
personal
ministrations
would
be
turned
aside
from
them
by
the
necessities
of
her
new
position
would
be
far
more
than
made
up
to
them
by
the
presence
among
them
of
a
whole
and
growing
family
instead
of
a
single
woman
only
but
all
this
jet
leaves
something
for
her
more
personal
friends
to
consider
as
regards
their
duty
in
the
matter
it
naturally
sets
them
on
the
track
of
finding
out
what
could
be
done
to
secure
for
the
children
of
such
parents
the
possession
of
early
advantages
as
little
lower
than
those
their
parents
had
as
may
be
for
the
breed
of
good
people
ought
as
much
as
possible
to
be
kept
up
i
will
turn
the
thing
over
in
my
mind
and
let
you
know
what
comes
of
it
the
result
of
lady
bernard
cogitations
is
in
so
far
to
be
seen
in
the
rapid
rise
of
a
block
of
houses
at
no
great
distance
from
london
on
the
railway
planned
under
the
instructions
of
marion
clare
the
design
of
them
is
to
provide
accommodation
for
all
marion
friends
with
room
to
add
largely
to
their
number
lady
bernard
has
also
secured
ground
sufficient
for
great
extension
of
the
present
building
should
it
prove
desirable
each
family
is
to
have
the
same
amount
of
accommodation
it
has
now
only
far
better
at
the
same
rent
it
pays
now
with
the
privilege
of
taking
an
additional
room
or
rooms
at
a
much
lower
rate
marion
has
undertaken
to
collect
the
rents
and
believes
that
she
will
thus
in
time
gain
an
additional
hold
of
the
people
for
their
good
although
the
plan
may
at
first
expose
her
to
misunderstanding
from
thorough
calculation
she
is
satisfied
she
can
pay
lady
bernard
five
per
cent
for
her
money
lay
out
all
that
is
necessary
for
keeping
the
property
in
thorough
repair
and
accumulate
a
fund
besides
to
be
spent
on
building
more
houses
should
her
expectations
of
these
be
answered
the
removal
of
so
many
will
also
make
a
little
room
for
the
accommodation
of
the
multitudes
constantly
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
wickedness
of
those
who
either
for
the
sake
of
railways
or
fine
streets
pull
down
crowded
houses
and
drive
into
other
courts
and
alleys
their
poor
inhabitants
to
double
the
wretchedness
already
there
from
overcrowding
in
the
centre
of
the
building
is
a
house
for
herself
where
she
will
have
her
own
private
advantage
in
the
inclusion
of
large
space
primarily
for
the
entertainment
of
her
friends
i
believe
lady
bernard
intends
to
give
her
a
hint
that
a
married
couple
would
in
her
opinion
be
far
more
useful
in
such
a
position
than
a
single
woman
but
although
i
rejoice
in
the
prospect
of
greater
happiness
for
two
dear
friends
i
must
in
honesty
say
that
i
doubt
this
if
the
scheme
should
answer
what
a
strange
reversion
it
will
be
to
something
like
a
right
reading
of
the
feudal
system
of
course
it
will
be
objected
that
should
it
succeed
ever
so
well
it
will
all
go
to
pieces
at
marion
death
to
this
the
answer
lies
in
the
hope
that
her
influence
may
extend
laterally
as
well
as
downwards
moving
others
to
be
what
she
has
been
and
in
the
conviction
that
such
a
work
as
hers
can
never
be
lost
for
the
world
can
never
be
the
same
as
if
she
had
not
lived
while
in
any
case
there
will
be
more
room
for
her
brothers
and
sisters
who
are
now
being
crowded
out
of
the
world
by
the
stronger
and
richer
it
would
be
sufficient
answer
however
that
the
work
is
worth
doing
for
its
own
sake
and
its
immediate
result
surely
it
will
receive
a
from
the
judge
of
us
all
and
while
his
idea
of
right
remains
above
hers
high
as
the
heavens
are
above
the
earth
his
approbation
will
be
all
that
either
lady
bernard
or
marion
will
seek
if
but
a
small
proportion
of
those
who
love
the
right
and
have
means
to
spare
would
like
lady
bernard
use
their
wealth
to
make
up
to
the
poor
for
the
wrongs
they
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
rich
let
me
say
to
defend
the
saviour
in
their
persons
from
the
tyranny
of
mammon
how
many
of
the
poor
might
they
not
lead
with
them
into
the
joy
of
their
lord
should
the
plan
succeed
i
say
once
more
i
intend
to
urge
on
marion
the
duty
of
writing
a
history
of
its
rise
and
progress
from
the
first
of
her
own
attempts
then
there
would
at
least
remain
a
book
for
all
future
reformers
and
philanthropists
to
study
and
her
influence
might
renew
itself
in
other
ages
after
she
was
gone
i
have
no
more
to
say
about
myself
or
my
people
we
live
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
god
here
i
was
going
to
write
the
end
but
was
arrested
by
the
following
conversation
between
two
of
my
children
ernest
eight
and
freddy
five
years
of
age
i
do
it
for
mamma
of
course
would
you
do
it
for
harry
no
harry
nobody
yes
he
is
somebody
you
nobody
i
nobody
we
are
all
nobody
compared
to
mamma
yes
i
am
somebody
you
nothing
i
nothing
we
are
all
nothing
in
presence
but
ernest
is
something
so
i
must
be
something
yes
freddy
but
you
so
you
nothing
nothing
to
mamma
i
