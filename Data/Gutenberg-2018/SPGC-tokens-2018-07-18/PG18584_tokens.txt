we
like

not
the
readers
amazing
stories
drop
us
a
line
after
you
read
chalmers
stopped
talking
abruptly
warned
by
the
sudden
attentiveness
of
the
class
in
front
of
him
they
were
all
staring
even
guellick
in
the
fourth
row
was
almost
half
awake
then
one
of
them
taking
his
silence
as
an
invitation
to
questions
found
his
voice
you
say
khalid
hussein
been
assassinated
he
asked
incredulously
when
did
that
happen
illustration
there
was
no
past
no
future
only
a
great
chaotic
now
in
at
basra
there
was
a
touch
of
impatience
in
his
voice
surely
they
ought
to
know
that
much
he
was
shot
while
leaving
the
parliament
building
by
an
egyptian
arab
named
mohammed
noureed
with
an
old
army
noureed
killed
two
of
khalid
guards
and
wounded
another
before
he
was
overpowered
he
was
lynched
on
the
spot
by
the
crowd
stoned
to
death
ostensibly
he
and
his
accomplices
were
religious
fanatics
however
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
murder
was
inspired
at
least
indirectly
by
the
eastern
axis
the
class
stirred
like
a
in
the
wind
some
looked
at
him
in
blank
amazement
some
were
hastily
averting
faces
red
with
poorly
suppressed
laughter
for
a
moment
he
was
puzzled
and
then
realization
hit
him
like
a
blow
in
the
he
forgotten
again
i
did
see
anything
in
the
papers
about
it
one
boy
was
saying
the
newscast
last
evening
said
khalid
was
in
ankara
talking
to
the
president
of
turkey
another
offered
professor
chalmers
would
you
tell
us
just
what
effect
khalid
death
had
upon
the
islamic
caliphate
and
the
middle
eastern
situation
in
general
a
third
voice
asked
with
exaggerated
solemnity
that
was
kendrick
the
class
humorist
the
question
was
pure
baiting
well
kendrick
i
afraid
it
a
little
too
early
to
assess
the
full
results
of
a
thing
like
that
if
they
can
ever
be
fully
assessed
for
instance
who
in
could
have
predicted
all
the
consequences
of
the
at
sarajevo
who
even
today
can
guess
what
the
history
of
the
world
would
have
been
had
zangarra
not
missed
franklin
roosevelt
in
there
always
that
if
he
went
on
talking
safe
generalities
as
he
glanced
covertly
at
his
watch
only
five
minutes
to
the
end
of
the
period
thank
heaven
he
had
made
that
slip
at
the
beginning
of
the
class
for
instance
tomorrow
when
we
take
up
the
events
in
india
from
the
first
world
war
to
the
end
of
british
rule
we
will
be
largely
concerned
with
another
victim
of
the
assassin
bullet
mohandas
gandhi
you
may
ask
yourselves
then
by
how
much
that
bullet
altered
the
history
of
the
indian
a
word
of
warning
however
the
events
we
will
be
discussing
will
be
either
contemporary
with
or
prior
to
what
was
discussed
today
i
hope
that
you
all
keeping
your
notes
properly
dated
it
always
easy
to
become
confused
in
matters
of
chronology
he
wished
too
late
that
he
had
said
that
it
pointed
up
the
very
thing
he
was
trying
to
play
down
and
raised
a
general
laugh
as
soon
as
the
room
was
empty
he
hastened
to
his
desk
snatched
pencil
and
notepad
this
had
been
a
bad
one
the
worst
yet
he
heard
the
end
of
it
by
any
means
he
could
waste
thought
on
that
now
though
this
was
all
new
and
important
it
had
welled
up
suddenly
and
without
warning
into
his
conscious
mind
and
he
must
get
it
down
in
notes
before
the
memory
even
mentally
he
always
put
that
word
into
quotes
was
lost
he
was
still
scribbling
furiously
when
the
instructor
who
would
use
the
room
for
the
next
period
entered
followed
by
a
few
of
his
students
chalmers
finished
crammed
the
notes
into
his
pocket
and
went
out
into
the
hall
most
of
his
own
modern
history
iv
class
had
left
the
building
and
were
on
their
way
across
the
campus
for
science
classes
a
few
however
were
joining
groups
for
other
classes
here
in
prescott
hall
and
in
every
group
they
were
the
center
of
interest
sometimes
when
they
saw
him
they
would
fall
silent
until
he
had
passed
sometimes
they
did
and
he
caught
snatches
of
conversation
oh
brother
did
chalmers
really
blow
his
jets
this
time
one
voice
was
saying
bet
he
wo
be
around
next
year
another
quartet
with
their
heads
together
were
talking
more
seriously
well
i
not
majoring
in
history
myself
but
i
think
it
an
outrage
that
some
people
diplomas
are
going
to
depend
on
grades
given
by
a
lunatic
mine
will
and
i
not
going
to
stand
for
it
my
old
man
president
of
the
alumni
association
and
that
was
something
he
had
not
thought
of
before
it
gave
him
an
ugly
start
he
was
still
thinking
about
it
as
he
turned
into
the
side
hall
to
the
history
department
offices
and
entered
the
cubicle
he
shared
with
a
colleague
the
colleague
old
pottgeiter
medieval
history
was
emerging
in
a
rush
short
rotund
his
arms
full
of
books
and
papers
oblivious
as
usual
to
anything
that
had
happened
since
the
battle
of
bosworth
or
the
fall
of
constantinople
chalmers
stepped
quickly
out
of
his
way
and
entered
behind
him
marjorie
fenner
the
secretary
they
also
shared
was
tidying
up
the
old
desk
good
morning
doctor
chalmers
she
looked
at
him
keenly
for
a
moment
they
give
you
a
bad
time
again
in
modern
four
good
lord
did
he
show
it
that
plainly
in
any
case
it
was
no
use
trying
to
kid
marjorie
she
hear
the
whole
story
before
the
end
of
the
day
gave
myself
a
bad
time
marjorie
still
fussing
with
pottgeiter
desk
was
about
to
say
something
in
reply
instead
she
exclaimed
in
exasperation
ohhh
that
man
he
forgotten
his
notes
again
she
gathered
some
papers
from
pottgeiter
desk
rushing
across
the
room
and
out
the
door
with
them
for
a
while
he
sat
motionless
the
books
and
notes
for
general
european
history
ii
untouched
in
front
of
him
this
was
going
to
raise
hell
it
had
been
the
first
slip
he
made
either
that
thought
kept
recurring
to
him
there
had
been
the
time
when
he
had
alluded
to
the
colonies
on
mars
and
venus
there
had
been
the
time
he
mentioned
the
secession
of
canada
from
the
british
commonwealth
and
the
time
he
called
the
the
terran
federation
and
the
time
he
tried
to
get
a
copy
of
franchard
and
decline
of
the
system
which
would
be
published
until
the
century
out
of
the
college
library
none
of
those
had
drawn
much
comment
beyond
a
few
student
jokes
about
the
history
professor
who
lived
in
the
future
instead
of
the
past
now
however
they
all
be
remembered
raked
up
exaggerated
and
added
to
what
had
happened
this
morning
he
sighed
and
sat
down
at
marjorie
typewriter
and
began
transcribing
his
notes
assassination
of
khalid
hussein
the
leader
of
the
newly
formed
islamic
caliphate
period
of
anarchy
in
the
middle
east
interfactional
turkish
intervention
he
wondered
how
long
that
would
last
khalid
son
tallal
khalid
was
at
school
in
england
when
his
father
was
would
be
killed
he
would
return
and
eventually
take
his
father
place
in
time
to
bring
the
caliphate
into
the
terran
federation
when
the
general
war
came
there
were
some
notes
on
that
already
the
war
would
result
from
an
attempt
by
the
indian
communists
to
seize
east
pakistan
the
trouble
was
that
he
so
seldom
remembered
an
exact
date
his
memory
of
the
year
of
khalid
assassination
was
an
exception
nineteen
why
that
was
this
year
he
looked
at
the
calendar
october
at
very
most
the
arab
statesman
had
two
and
a
half
months
to
live
would
there
be
any
possible
way
in
which
he
could
give
a
credible
warning
he
doubted
it
even
if
there
were
he
questioned
whether
he
should
for
that
matter
whether
he
interfere
he
always
lunched
at
the
faculty
club
today
was
no
time
to
call
attention
to
himself
by
breaking
an
established
routine
as
he
entered
trying
to
avoid
either
a
furtive
slink
or
a
swagger
the
crowd
in
the
lobby
stopped
talking
abruptly
then
began
again
on
an
obviously
changed
subject
the
word
had
gotten
around
apparently
handley
the
head
of
the
latin
department
greeted
him
with
a
distantly
polite
nod
pompous
old
owl
regarded
himself
for
some
reason
as
a
sort
of
unofficial
dean
of
the
faculty
probably
did
want
to
be
seen
fraternizing
with
controversial
characters
one
of
the
younger
men
with
a
thin
face
and
a
mop
of
unruly
hair
advanced
to
meet
him
as
he
came
in
as
cordial
as
handley
was
remote
oh
hello
ed
he
greeted
clapping
a
hand
on
chalmers
shoulder
i
was
hoping
i
run
into
you
can
you
have
dinner
with
us
this
evening
he
was
sincere
well
thanks
leonard
i
like
to
but
i
have
a
lot
of
work
could
you
give
me
a
oh
surely
my
wife
was
wishing
you
come
around
but
i
know
how
it
is
some
other
evening
yes
indeed
he
guided
fitch
toward
the
door
and
nodded
toward
a
table
this
does
look
too
crowded
let
sit
here
after
lunch
he
stopped
in
at
his
office
marjorie
fenner
was
there
taking
dictation
from
pottgeiter
she
nodded
to
him
as
he
entered
but
she
had
no
summons
to
the
president
office
the
summons
was
waiting
for
him
the
next
morning
when
he
entered
the
office
after
modern
history
iv
a
few
minutes
past
ten
doctor
whitburn
just
phoned
marjorie
said
he
like
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
have
a
vacant
period
which
means
right
away
i
sha
keep
him
waiting
she
started
to
say
something
swallowed
it
and
then
asked
if
he
needed
anything
typed
up
for
general
european
ii
no
i
have
everything
ready
he
pocketed
the
pipe
he
had
filled
on
entering
and
went
out
the
president
of
blanley
college
sat
hunched
forward
at
his
desk
he
had
rounded
shoulders
and
round
pudgy
fists
and
a
round
bald
head
he
seemed
to
be
expecting
his
visitor
to
stand
at
attention
in
front
of
him
chalmers
got
the
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
snapped
his
lighter
good
morning
doctor
whitburn
he
said
very
pleasantly
whitburn
scowl
deepened
i
hope
i
do
have
to
tell
you
why
i
wanted
to
see
you
he
began
i
have
an
idea
chalmers
puffed
until
the
pipe
was
drawing
satisfactorily
it
might
help
you
get
started
if
you
did
though
i
do
suppose
at
that
that
you
realize
the
full
effect
of
your
performance
yesterday
morning
in
modern
history
four
whitburn
replied
i
do
suppose
you
know
for
instance
that
i
had
to
intervene
at
the
last
moment
and
suppress
an
editorial
in
the
and
derisively
critical
of
you
and
your
teaching
methods
and
by
implication
of
the
administration
of
this
college
you
did
hear
about
that
did
you
no
living
as
you
do
in
the
future
you
would
if
the
students
who
edit
the
and
are
dissatisfied
with
anything
here
i
imagine
they
ought
to
say
so
chalmers
commented
is
that
what
they
teach
in
the
journalism
classes
that
the
purpose
of
journalism
is
to
speak
for
the
dissatisfied
why
make
exception
i
should
think
you
be
grateful
to
me
for
trying
to
keep
your
behavior
from
being
made
a
subject
of
public
ridicule
among
your
students
why
this
editorial
which
i
suppressed
actually
went
so
far
as
to
question
your
sanity
i
should
suppose
it
might
have
sounded
a
good
deal
like
that
to
them
of
course
i
have
been
preoccupied
lately
with
an
imaginative
projection
of
present
trends
into
the
future
i
quite
freely
admit
that
i
should
have
kept
my
extracurricular
work
separate
from
my
class
and
lecture
work
but
that
no
excuse
even
if
i
were
sure
it
were
true
what
you
did
while
engaged
in
the
serious
teaching
of
history
was
to
indulge
in
a
farrago
of
nonsense
obvious
as
such
to
any
child
and
damage
not
only
your
own
standing
with
your
class
but
the
standing
of
blanley
college
as
well
doctor
chalmers
if
this
were
the
first
incident
of
the
kind
it
would
be
bad
enough
but
it
is
you
done
things
like
this
before
and
i
warned
you
before
i
assumed
then
that
you
were
merely
showing
the
effects
of
overwork
and
i
offered
you
a
vacation
which
you
refused
to
take
well
this
is
the
limit
i
compelled
to
request
your
immediate
resignation
chalmers
laughed
a
moment
ago
you
accused
me
of
living
in
the
future
it
seems
you
living
in
the
past
evidently
you
heard
about
the
higher
education
faculty
tenure
act
of
or
such
things
as
well
for
your
information
i
have
one
you
signed
it
yourself
in
case
you
forgotten
if
you
want
my
resignation
you
have
to
show
cause
in
a
court
of
law
why
my
contract
should
be
voided
and
i
do
think
a
slip
of
the
tongue
is
a
reason
for
voiding
a
contract
that
any
court
would
accept
whitburn
face
reddened
you
do
do
you
well
maybe
it
is
but
insanity
is
it
a
very
good
reason
for
voiding
a
contract
voidable
on
grounds
of
unfitness
or
incapacity
to
teach
he
had
been
expecting
and
mentally
shrinking
from
just
that
now
that
it
was
out
however
he
felt
relieved
he
gave
another
short
laugh
you
willing
to
go
into
open
court
covered
by
reporters
from
papers
you
ca
control
as
you
do
this
student
sheet
here
and
testify
that
for
the
past
twelve
years
you
had
an
insane
professor
on
your
faculty
you
you
trying
to
blackmail
me
whitburn
demanded
half
rising
it
is
blackmail
to
tell
a
man
that
a
bomb
he
going
to
throw
will
blow
up
in
his
hand
chalmers
glanced
quickly
at
his
watch
now
doctor
whitburn
if
you
have
nothing
further
to
discuss
i
have
a
class
in
a
few
minutes
if
you
excuse
me
he
rose
for
a
moment
he
stood
facing
whitburn
when
the
college
president
said
nothing
he
inclined
his
head
politely
and
turned
going
out
whitburn
secretary
gave
the
impression
of
having
seated
herself
hastily
at
her
desk
the
second
before
he
opened
the
door
she
watched
him
as
he
went
out
into
the
hall
he
reached
his
own
office
ten
minutes
before
time
for
the
next
class
marjorie
was
typing
something
for
pottgeiter
he
merely
nodded
to
her
and
picked
up
the
phone
the
call
would
have
to
go
through
the
school
exchange
and
he
had
a
suspicion
that
whitburn
kept
a
check
on
outside
calls
that
might
not
hurt
any
he
thought
dialing
a
number
attorney
weill
office
the
girl
who
answered
said
edward
chalmers
is
weill
in
she
find
out
he
was
he
answered
in
a
few
seconds
hello
stanly
ed
chalmers
i
think
i
going
to
need
a
little
help
i
having
some
trouble
with
president
whitburn
here
at
the
college
a
matter
involving
the
validity
of
my
i
do
want
to
go
into
it
over
this
line
have
you
anything
on
for
lunch
no
i
have
when
and
where
the
lawyer
asked
he
thought
for
a
moment
nowhere
too
close
the
campus
but
not
too
far
away
how
about
the
continental
fontainbleu
room
say
that
be
all
right
be
seeing
you
marjorie
looked
at
him
curiously
as
he
gathered
up
the
things
he
needed
for
the
next
class
stanly
weill
had
a
thin
face
he
was
frowning
as
he
set
down
his
ed
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
try
to
kid
your
lawyer
he
said
you
say
whitburn
trying
to
force
you
to
resign
with
your
contract
he
ca
do
that
not
without
good
and
sufficient
cause
and
under
the
faculty
tenure
law
that
means
something
just
an
inch
short
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
now
what
whitburn
got
on
you
beat
around
the
bush
and
try
to
build
a
background
or
come
out
with
it
at
once
and
fill
in
the
details
afterward
he
debated
mentally
for
a
moment
then
decided
upon
the
latter
course
well
it
happens
that
i
have
the
ability
to
prehend
future
events
i
can
by
concentrating
bring
into
my
mind
the
history
of
the
world
at
least
in
general
outline
for
the
next
five
thousand
years
whitburn
thinks
i
crazy
mainly
because
i
get
confused
at
times
and
forget
that
something
i
know
about
has
happened
yet
weill
snatched
the
cigarette
from
his
mouth
to
keep
from
swallowing
it
as
it
was
he
choked
on
a
mouthful
of
smoke
and
coughed
violently
then
sat
back
in
the
staring
speechlessly
it
started
a
little
over
three
years
ago
chalmers
continued
just
after
new
year
i
was
getting
up
a
series
of
seminars
for
some
of
my
postgraduate
students
on
extrapolation
of
present
social
and
political
trends
to
the
middle
of
the
next
century
and
i
began
to
find
that
i
was
getting
some
very
fixed
and
definite
ideas
of
what
the
world
of
to
would
be
like
completely
unified
world
abolition
of
all
national
states
under
a
single
world
sovereignty
colonies
on
mars
and
venus
that
sort
of
thing
some
of
these
ideas
did
seem
quite
logical
a
number
of
them
were
complete
reversals
of
present
trends
and
a
lot
seemed
to
depend
on
arbitrary
and
unpredictable
factors
mind
this
was
before
the
first
rocket
landed
on
the
moon
when
the
whole
and
project
was
a
secret
but
i
knew
in
the
spring
of
that
the
first
unmanned
rocket
would
be
called
the
and
that
it
would
be
launched
some
time
in
you
remember
when
the
news
was
released
it
was
stated
that
the
rocket
had
been
christened
until
the
day
before
it
was
launched
when
somebody
remembered
that
old
thing
from
the
second
world
war
well
i
knew
about
it
over
a
year
in
advance
weill
had
been
listening
in
silence
he
had
a
naturally
skeptical
face
his
present
expression
might
really
mean
that
he
believe
what
he
was
hearing
how
you
get
all
this
stuff
in
dreams
chalmers
shook
his
head
it
just
came
to
me
i
be
sitting
reading
or
eating
dinner
or
talking
to
one
of
my
classes
and
the
first
thing
i
know
something
out
of
the
future
would
come
bubbling
up
in
me
it
just
kept
pushing
up
into
my
conscious
mind
i
would
have
an
idea
of
something
one
minute
and
the
next
it
would
just
be
part
of
my
general
historical
knowledge
i
know
it
as
positively
as
i
know
that
columbus
discovered
america
in
the
only
difference
is
that
i
can
usually
remember
where
i
read
something
in
past
history
but
my
future
history
i
know
without
knowing
how
i
know
it
ah
that
the
question
weill
pounced
you
do
know
how
you
know
it
look
ed
we
both
studied
psychology
elementary
psychology
at
least
anybody
who
has
to
work
with
people
these
days
has
to
know
some
psychology
what
makes
you
sure
that
these
prophetic
impressions
of
yours
are
manufactured
in
your
own
subconscious
mind
that
what
i
thought
at
first
i
thought
my
subconscious
was
just
building
up
this
stuff
to
fill
the
gaps
in
what
i
produced
from
logical
extrapolation
i
always
been
a
stickler
for
detail
he
added
parenthetically
it
would
be
natural
for
me
to
supply
details
for
the
future
but
as
i
said
a
lot
of
this
stuff
is
based
on
unpredictable
and
arbitrary
factors
that
ca
be
inferred
from
anything
in
the
present
that
left
me
with
the
alternatives
of
delusion
or
precognition
and
if
i
ever
came
near
going
crazy
it
was
before
the
landed
and
the
news
was
released
after
that
i
knew
which
it
was
and
yet
you
ca
explain
how
you
can
have
real
knowledge
of
a
thing
before
it
happens
before
it
exists
weill
said
i
really
do
need
to
i
satisfied
with
knowing
that
i
know
but
if
you
want
me
to
furnish
a
theory
let
say
that
all
these
things
really
do
exist
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
and
that
the
present
is
just
a
moving
that
separates
the
two
you
ca
even
indicate
the
present
by
the
time
you
make
up
your
mind
to
say
and
transmit
the
impulse
to
your
vocal
organs
and
utter
the
word
the
original
present
moment
is
part
of
the
past
the
has
gone
over
it
most
people
think
they
know
only
the
present
what
they
know
is
the
past
which
they
have
already
experienced
or
read
about
the
difference
with
me
is
that
i
can
see
what
on
both
sides
of
the
weill
put
another
cigarette
in
his
mouth
and
bent
his
head
to
the
flame
of
his
lighter
for
a
moment
he
sat
motionless
his
thin
face
rigid
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
i
a
lawyer
not
a
psychiatrist
i
want
a
lawyer
this
is
a
legal
matter
whitburn
talking
about
voiding
my
tenure
contract
you
helped
draw
it
i
have
a
right
to
expect
you
to
help
defend
it
ed
have
you
been
talking
about
this
to
anybody
else
weill
asked
you
the
first
person
i
mentioned
it
to
it
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
bring
up
casually
in
a
conversation
then
how
whitburn
get
hold
of
it
he
did
not
the
way
i
given
it
to
you
but
i
made
a
couple
of
slips
now
and
then
i
made
a
bad
one
yesterday
morning
he
told
weill
about
it
and
about
his
session
with
the
president
of
the
college
that
morning
the
lawyer
nodded
that
was
a
bad
one
but
you
handled
whitburn
the
right
way
weill
said
what
he
most
afraid
of
is
publicity
getting
the
college
mixed
up
in
anything
controversial
and
above
all
the
reactions
of
the
trustees
and
people
like
that
if
dacre
or
anybody
else
makes
any
trouble
he
do
his
best
to
cover
for
you
not
willingly
of
course
but
because
he
know
that
that
the
only
way
he
can
cover
for
himself
i
do
think
you
have
any
more
trouble
with
him
if
you
can
keep
your
own
nose
clean
that
is
can
you
do
that
i
believe
so
yesterday
i
got
careless
i
not
do
that
again
you
better
not
weill
hesitated
for
a
moment
i
said
i
was
a
lawyer
not
a
psychiatrist
i
going
to
give
you
some
advice
though
forget
this
whole
thing
you
say
you
can
bring
these
impressions
into
your
conscious
mind
by
concentrating
he
waited
briefly
chalmers
nodded
and
he
continued
well
stop
it
stop
trying
to
harbor
this
stuff
it
dangerous
ed
stop
playing
around
with
it
you
think
i
crazy
too
weill
shook
his
head
impatiently
i
did
say
that
but
i
say
now
that
you
losing
your
grip
on
reality
you
are
constructing
a
system
of
fantasies
and
the
first
thing
you
know
they
will
become
your
reality
and
the
world
around
you
will
be
unreal
and
illusory
and
that
a
state
of
mental
incompetence
that
i
can
recognize
as
a
lawyer
how
about
the
weill
looked
at
him
intently
ed
are
you
sure
you
did
have
that
experience
he
asked
i
not
trying
to
imply
that
consciously
lying
to
me
about
that
i
am
suggesting
that
you
manufactured
a
memory
of
that
incident
in
your
subconscious
mind
and
are
deluding
yourself
into
thinking
that
you
knew
about
it
in
advance
false
memory
is
a
fairly
common
thing
in
cases
like
this
even
the
little
psychology
i
know
i
heard
about
that
there
been
talk
about
rockets
to
the
moon
for
years
you
included
something
about
that
in
your
fantasy
and
then
after
the
event
you
convinced
yourself
that
you
known
all
about
it
including
the
impromptu
christening
of
the
rocket
all
along
a
hot
retort
rose
to
his
lips
he
swallowed
it
hastily
instead
he
nodded
amicably
that
a
point
worth
thinking
of
but
right
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
will
you
represent
me
in
case
whitburn
does
take
this
to
court
and
does
try
to
void
my
contract
oh
yes
as
you
said
i
have
an
obligation
to
defend
the
contracts
i
draw
up
but
you
have
to
avoid
giving
him
any
further
reason
for
trying
to
void
it
do
make
any
more
of
these
slips
watch
what
you
say
in
class
or
out
of
it
and
above
all
do
talk
about
this
to
anybody
do
tell
anybody
that
you
can
foresee
the
future
or
even
talk
about
future
probabilities
your
business
is
with
the
past
stick
to
it
the
afternoon
passed
quietly
enough
word
of
his
defiance
of
whitburn
had
gotten
around
among
the
faculty
whitburn
might
have
his
secretary
scared
witless
in
his
office
but
not
gossipless
outside
it
though
it
had
seemed
to
have
leaked
down
to
the
students
yet
handley
the
latin
professor
managed
to
waylay
him
in
a
hallway
a
hallway
handley
did
normally
use
the
system
under
which
we
hold
our
positions
here
is
one
of
our
most
valuable
safeguards
he
said
after
exchanging
greetings
it
was
only
won
after
a
struggle
in
a
time
of
public
animosity
toward
all
intellectuals
and
even
now
our
professional
position
would
be
most
insecure
without
it
yes
i
found
that
out
today
if
i
had
known
it
when
i
took
part
in
the
struggle
you
speak
of
it
should
not
be
jeopardized
handley
declared
you
think
i
jeopardizing
it
handley
frowned
he
did
like
being
pushed
out
of
the
safety
of
generalization
into
specific
cases
well
now
that
you
make
that
point
yes
i
do
if
doctor
whitburn
tries
to
make
an
issue
of
of
what
happened
yesterday
and
if
the
court
decides
against
you
you
can
see
the
position
all
of
us
will
be
in
what
do
you
think
i
should
have
done
given
him
my
resignation
when
he
demanded
it
we
have
our
and
the
system
was
instituted
to
prevent
just
the
sort
of
arbitrary
action
whitburn
tried
to
take
with
me
today
if
he
wants
to
go
to
court
he
find
that
out
and
if
he
wins
he
establish
a
precedent
that
will
threaten
the
security
of
every
college
and
university
faculty
member
in
the
state
in
any
state
where
there
a
tenure
law
leonard
fitch
the
psychologist
took
an
opposite
attitude
as
chalmers
was
leaving
the
college
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
fitch
cut
across
the
campus
to
intercept
him
i
heard
about
the
way
you
stood
up
to
whitburn
this
morning
ed
he
said
glad
you
did
it
i
only
wish
i
done
something
like
that
three
years
ago
think
he
going
to
give
you
any
real
trouble
i
doubt
it
well
i
on
your
side
if
he
does
i
wo
be
the
only
one
either
well
thank
you
leonard
it
always
helps
to
know
that
i
do
think
there
be
any
more
trouble
though
he
dined
alone
at
his
apartment
and
sat
over
his
coffee
outlining
his
work
for
the
next
day
when
both
were
finished
he
dallied
indecisively
weill
words
echoing
through
his
mind
and
raising
doubts
it
was
possible
that
he
had
been
manufacturing
the
whole
thing
in
his
subconscious
mind
that
was
at
least
a
more
plausible
theory
than
any
he
had
constructed
to
explain
an
ability
to
produce
real
knowledge
of
the
future
of
course
there
was
that
business
about
the
that
had
been
too
close
on
too
many
points
to
be
dismissed
as
coincidence
then
again
weill
words
came
back
to
disquiet
him
had
he
really
gotten
that
before
the
event
as
he
believed
or
had
he
only
imagined
later
that
he
had
there
was
one
way
to
settle
that
he
rose
quickly
and
went
to
the
where
he
kept
his
notes
and
began
pulling
out
envelopes
there
was
nothing
about
the
in
the
twentieth
century
file
where
it
should
be
although
he
examined
each
sheet
of
notes
carefully
the
possibility
that
his
notes
on
that
might
have
been
filed
out
of
place
by
mistake
occurred
to
him
he
looked
in
every
other
envelope
the
notes
as
far
as
they
went
were
all
filed
in
order
and
each
one
bore
beside
the
future
date
of
occurrence
the
date
on
which
the
knowledge
or
must
he
call
it
delusion
had
come
to
him
but
there
was
no
note
on
the
landing
of
the
first
unmanned
rocket
on
luna
he
put
the
notes
away
and
went
back
to
his
desk
rummaging
through
the
drawers
and
finding
nothing
he
searched
everywhere
in
the
apartment
where
a
sheet
of
paper
could
have
been
mislaid
taking
all
his
books
one
by
one
from
the
shelves
and
leafing
through
them
even
books
he
knew
he
had
not
touched
for
more
than
three
years
in
the
end
he
sat
down
again
at
his
desk
defeated
the
note
on
the
simply
did
not
exist
of
course
that
did
settle
it
as
finding
the
note
would
have
he
remembered
or
believed
he
remembered
having
gotten
that
item
of
knowledge
or
delusion
in
shortly
before
the
end
of
the
school
term
it
had
been
until
after
the
fall
opening
of
school
that
he
had
begun
making
notes
he
could
have
had
the
knowledge
of
the
robot
rocket
in
his
mind
then
and
neglected
putting
it
on
paper
he
undressed
put
on
his
pajamas
poured
himself
a
drink
and
went
to
bed
three
hours
later
still
awake
he
got
up
and
poured
himself
another
bigger
drink
somehow
eventually
he
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
he
searched
his
desk
and
in
the
office
at
school
he
had
never
kept
a
diary
now
he
was
wishing
that
he
had
that
might
have
contained
something
that
would
be
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
all
day
he
vacillated
between
conviction
of
the
reality
of
his
future
knowledge
and
resolution
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
once
he
decided
to
destroy
all
the
notes
he
had
made
and
thought
of
making
a
special
study
of
some
facet
of
history
and
writing
another
book
to
occupy
his
mind
after
lunch
he
found
that
more
data
on
the
period
immediately
before
the
thirty
days
war
was
coming
into
his
consciousness
he
resolutely
suppressed
it
knowing
as
he
did
that
it
might
never
come
to
him
again
that
evening
too
he
cooked
dinner
for
himself
at
his
apartment
and
laid
out
his
for
the
next
day
he
better
not
stay
in
that
evening
too
much
temptation
to
settle
himself
by
the
fire
with
his
pipe
and
his
notepad
and
indulge
in
the
vice
he
had
determined
to
renounce
after
a
little
debate
he
decided
upon
a
movie
he
put
on
again
the
suit
he
had
taken
off
on
coming
home
and
went
out
the
picture
a
random
choice
among
the
three
shows
in
the
neighborhood
was
about
seventeenth
century
buccaneers
exciting
action
and
a
loud
with
shots
and
he
let
himself
be
drawn
into
it
completely
and
until
it
was
finished
he
was
able
to
forget
both
the
college
and
the
history
of
the
future
but
as
he
walked
home
he
was
struck
by
the
parallel
between
the
buccaneers
of
the
west
indies
and
the
in
the
days
of
the
dissolution
of
the
first
galactic
empire
in
the
tenth
century
of
the
interstellar
era
he
had
been
too
clear
on
that
period
and
he
found
new
data
rising
in
his
mind
he
hurried
his
steps
almost
running
upstairs
to
his
room
it
was
long
after
midnight
before
he
had
finished
the
notes
he
had
begun
on
his
return
home
well
that
had
been
a
mistake
but
he
would
make
it
again
he
determined
again
to
destroy
his
notes
and
began
casting
about
for
a
subject
which
would
occupy
his
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
the
future
not
the
spanish
conquistadores
that
was
too
much
like
the
early
period
of
interstellar
expansion
he
thought
for
a
time
of
the
sepoy
mutiny
and
then
rejected
it
he
could
remember
something
much
like
that
on
one
of
the
planets
of
the
beta
hydrae
system
in
the
fourth
century
of
the
atomic
era
there
were
so
few
things
in
the
history
of
the
past
which
did
not
have
their
in
the
future
that
evening
too
he
stayed
at
home
preparing
for
his
various
classes
for
the
rest
of
the
week
and
making
copious
notes
on
what
he
would
talk
about
to
each
he
needed
more
whiskey
to
get
to
sleep
that
night
whitburn
gave
him
no
more
trouble
and
if
any
of
the
trustees
or
influential
alumni
made
any
protest
about
what
had
happened
in
modern
history
iv
he
heard
nothing
about
it
he
managed
to
conduct
his
classes
without
further
incidents
and
spent
his
evenings
trying
not
always
successfully
to
avoid
drifting
into
memories
of
the
future
he
came
into
his
office
that
morning
tired
and
unrefreshed
by
the
few
hours
sleep
he
had
gotten
the
night
before
edgy
from
the
strain
of
trying
to
adjust
his
mind
to
the
world
of
blanley
college
in
of
pottgeiter
had
arrived
yet
but
marjorie
fenner
was
waiting
for
him
a
newspaper
in
her
hand
almost
bursting
with
excitement
here
have
you
seen
it
doctor
chalmers
she
asked
as
he
entered
he
shook
his
head
he
ought
to
read
the
papers
more
to
keep
track
of
the
advancing
that
divided
what
he
might
talk
about
from
what
he
was
supposed
to
know
but
each
morning
he
seemed
to
have
less
and
less
time
to
get
ready
for
work
well
look
look
at
that
she
thrust
the
paper
into
his
hands
still
folded
the
big
black
headline
where
he
could
see
it
khalid
hussein
assassinated
he
glanced
over
the
leading
paragraphs
leader
of
islamic
caliphate
shot
to
death
in
basra
leaving
parliament
building
for
his
palace
outside
the
city
fanatic
identified
as
an
egyptian
named
mohammed
noureed
old
american
two
guards
killed
and
a
third
seriously
wounded
seized
by
infuriated
mob
and
stoned
to
death
on
the
spot
for
a
moment
he
felt
guilt
until
he
realized
that
nothing
he
could
have
done
could
have
altered
the
event
the
death
of
khalid
hussein
and
all
the
millions
of
other
deaths
that
would
follow
it
were
fixed
in
the
matrix
of
the
continuum
including
maybe
the
death
of
an
obscure
professor
of
modern
history
named
edward
chalmers
at
least
this
be
the
end
of
that
silly
flap
about
what
happened
a
month
ago
in
modern
four
this
is
modern
history
now
i
can
talk
about
it
without
a
lot
of
fools
yelling
their
heads
off
she
was
staring
at
him
no
doubt
horrified
at
his
attitude
toward
what
was
really
a
shocking
and
senseless
crime
yes
of
course
the
man
dead
so
julius
caesar
but
we
gotten
over
being
shocked
at
his
murder
he
would
have
to
talk
about
it
in
modern
history
iv
he
supposed
explain
why
khalid
death
was
necessary
to
the
policies
of
the
eastern
axis
and
what
the
consequences
would
be
how
it
would
hasten
the
complete
dissolution
of
the
old
already
weakened
by
the
crisis
over
the
eastern
demands
for
the
demilitarization
and
internationalization
of
the
united
states
lunar
base
and
necessitate
the
formation
of
the
terran
federation
and
how
it
would
lead
eventually
to
the
thirty
days
war
no
he
could
talk
about
that
that
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
have
to
be
careful
about
the
too
easy
to
cut
himself
on
it
nobody
in
modern
history
iv
was
seated
when
he
entered
the
room
they
were
all
crowded
between
the
door
and
his
desk
he
stood
blinking
wondering
why
they
were
giving
him
an
ovation
and
why
kendrick
and
dacre
were
so
abjectly
apologetic
great
heavens
did
it
take
the
murder
of
the
greatest
moslem
since
saladin
to
convince
people
that
he
was
crazy
before
the
period
was
over
whitburn
secretary
entered
with
a
note
in
the
college
president
hand
and
over
his
signature
requesting
chalmers
to
come
to
his
office
immediately
and
without
delay
just
like
that
expected
him
to
walk
right
out
of
his
class
he
was
protesting
as
he
entered
the
president
office
whitburn
cut
him
off
short
doctor
chalmers
whitburn
had
risen
behind
his
desk
as
the
door
opened
i
certainly
hope
that
you
can
realize
that
there
was
nothing
but
the
most
purely
coincidental
connection
between
the
event
featured
in
this
morning
newspapers
and
your
performance
a
month
ago
in
modern
history
four
he
began
i
realize
nothing
of
the
sort
the
death
of
khalid
hussein
is
a
fact
of
history
unalterably
set
in
its
proper
place
in
it
was
a
fact
of
history
a
month
ago
no
less
than
today
so
that
going
to
be
your
attitude
that
your
wild
utterances
of
a
month
ago
have
now
been
vindicated
as
fulfilled
prophesies
and
i
suppose
you
intend
to
exploit
this
this
coincidence
to
the
utmost
the
involvement
of
blanley
college
in
a
mess
of
sensational
publicity
means
nothing
to
you
i
presume
i
have
any
idea
what
you
talking
about
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
did
give
this
story
to
the
local
newspaper
the
whitburn
demanded
i
did
not
i
have
mentioned
the
subject
to
anybody
connected
with
the
or
anybody
else
for
that
matter
except
my
attorney
a
month
ago
when
you
were
threatening
to
repudiate
the
contract
you
signed
with
me
i
suppose
i
expected
to
take
your
word
for
that
yes
you
are
unless
you
care
to
call
me
a
liar
in
so
many
words
he
moved
a
step
closer
lloyd
whitburn
outweighed
him
by
fifty
pounds
but
most
of
the
difference
was
fat
whitburn
must
have
realized
that
too
no
no
if
you
say
you
have
talked
about
it
to
the
that
enough
he
said
hastily
but
somebody
did
a
reporter
was
here
not
twenty
minutes
ago
he
refused
to
say
who
had
given
him
the
story
but
he
wanted
to
question
me
about
it
what
did
you
tell
him
i
refused
to
make
any
statement
whatever
i
also
called
colonel
tighlman
the
owner
of
the
paper
and
asked
him
very
reasonably
to
suppress
the
story
i
thought
that
my
own
position
and
the
importance
of
blanley
college
to
this
town
entitled
me
to
that
much
consideration
whitburn
face
became
almost
purple
he
he
laughed
at
me
newspaper
people
do
like
to
be
told
to
kill
stories
not
even
by
college
presidents
that
only
made
things
worse
personally
i
relish
the
prospect
of
having
this
publicized
any
more
than
you
do
i
can
assure
you
that
i
shall
be
most
guarded
if
any
of
the
reporters
talk
to
me
about
it
and
if
i
have
time
to
get
back
to
my
class
before
the
end
of
the
period
i
shall
ask
them
as
a
personal
favor
not
to
discuss
the
matter
outside
whitburn
did
take
the
hint
instead
he
paced
back
and
forth
storming
about
the
reporter
the
newspaper
owner
whoever
had
given
the
story
to
the
paper
and
finally
chalmers
himself
he
was
livid
with
rage
you
certainly
ca
imagine
that
when
you
made
those
remarks
in
class
you
actually
possessed
any
knowledge
of
a
thing
that
was
still
a
month
in
the
future
he
spluttered
why
it
ridiculous
utterly
preposterous
unusual
i
admit
but
the
fact
remains
that
i
did
i
should
of
course
have
been
more
careful
and
not
confused
future
with
past
events
the
students
did
understand
whitburn
stopping
short
my
god
man
you
crazy
he
cried
horrified
the
was
ringing
as
he
left
whitburn
office
that
meant
that
the
students
were
scattering
over
the
campus
talking
like
mad
he
shrugged
keeping
them
quiet
about
a
thing
like
this
would
have
been
possible
in
any
case
when
he
entered
his
office
stanly
weill
was
waiting
for
him
the
lawyer
drew
him
out
into
the
hallway
quickly
for
god
sake
have
you
been
talking
to
the
papers
he
demanded
after
what
i
told
you
no
but
somebody
has
he
told
about
the
call
to
whitburn
office
and
the
latter
behavior
weill
cursed
the
college
president
bitterly
any
time
you
want
to
get
a
story
in
the
just
order
frank
tighlman
not
to
print
it
well
if
you
have
talked
do
suppose
somebody
asks
me
a
reporter
no
comment
anybody
else
none
of
his
damn
business
and
above
all
do
let
anybody
finagle
you
into
making
any
claims
about
knowing
the
future
i
thought
we
had
this
under
control
now
that
it
out
in
the
open
what
that
fool
whitburn
do
is
guess
leonard
fitch
met
him
as
he
entered
the
faculty
club
sizzling
with
excitement
ed
this
has
done
it
he
began
jubilantly
this
is
one
nobody
can
laugh
off
it
direct
proof
of
precognition
and
because
of
the
prominence
of
the
event
everybody
will
hear
about
it
and
it
simply
ca
be
dismissed
as
coincidence
whitburn
trying
to
do
that
whitburn
a
fool
if
he
is
another
man
said
calmly
turning
he
saw
that
the
speaker
was
tom
smith
one
of
the
math
professors
i
figured
the
odds
against
that
being
chance
there
are
a
lot
of
variables
that
might
affect
it
one
way
or
another
but
ten
to
the
fifteenth
power
is
what
i
get
for
a
sort
of
median
figure
did
you
give
that
story
to
the
times
he
asked
fitch
suspicion
rising
and
dragging
anger
up
after
it
of
course
i
did
fitch
said
i
admit
i
had
to
go
behind
your
back
and
have
some
of
my
postgrads
get
statements
from
the
boys
in
your
history
class
but
you
would
talk
about
it
yourself
tom
smith
was
standing
beside
him
he
was
twenty
years
younger
than
chalmers
he
was
an
amateur
boxer
and
he
had
good
reflexes
he
caught
chalmers
arm
as
it
was
traveling
back
for
an
uppercut
and
held
it
take
it
easy
ed
you
do
want
to
start
a
slugfest
in
here
this
is
the
faculty
club
remember
i
wo
tom
it
would
prove
anything
if
i
did
he
turned
to
fitch
i
wo
talk
about
sending
your
students
to
pump
mine
but
at
least
you
could
have
told
me
before
you
gave
that
story
out
i
do
know
what
you
sore
about
fitch
defended
himself
i
believed
in
you
when
everybody
else
thought
you
were
crazy
and
if
i
had
collected
signed
and
dated
statements
from
your
boys
have
been
no
substantiation
it
happens
that
extrasensory
perception
means
as
much
to
me
as
history
does
to
you
i
believed
in
it
ever
since
i
read
about
rhine
work
when
i
was
a
kid
i
worked
in
esp
for
a
long
time
then
i
had
a
chance
to
get
a
full
professorship
by
coming
here
and
after
i
did
i
found
that
i
could
go
on
with
it
because
whitburn
president
here
and
he
a
stupid
old
bigot
with
an
mind
yes
his
anger
died
down
as
fitch
spoke
i
glad
tom
stopped
me
from
making
an
ass
of
myself
i
can
see
your
side
of
it
maybe
that
was
the
curse
of
the
professional
intellectual
an
ability
to
see
everybody
side
of
everything
he
thought
for
a
moment
what
else
did
you
do
beside
hand
this
story
to
the
times
i
better
hear
all
about
it
i
phoned
the
secretary
of
the
american
institute
of
psionics
and
parapsychology
as
soon
as
i
saw
this
morning
paper
with
the
to
the
east
coast
i
got
him
just
as
he
reached
his
office
he
advised
me
to
give
the
thing
the
widest
possible
publicity
he
thought
that
would
advance
the
recognition
and
study
of
parapsychology
a
case
like
this
ca
be
ignored
it
will
demand
serious
study
well
you
got
your
publicity
all
right
i
up
to
my
neck
in
it
there
was
an
uproar
outside
the
doorman
was
saying
firmly
this
is
the
faculty
club
gentlemen
it
for
members
only
i
care
if
you
gentlemen
are
the
press
you
simply
can
not
come
in
here
we
all
up
to
our
necks
in
it
smith
said
leonard
i
do
care
what
your
motives
were
you
ought
to
have
considered
the
effect
on
the
rest
of
us
first
this
place
will
be
a
madhouse
handley
complained
how
we
going
to
get
any
of
these
students
to
keep
their
minds
on
their
work
i
tell
you
i
do
know
a
confounded
thing
about
it
max
pottgeiter
voice
rose
petulantly
at
the
door
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
professor
chalmers
murdered
some
arab
ridiculous
he
ate
hastily
and
without
enjoyment
and
slipped
through
the
kitchen
and
out
the
back
door
cutting
between
two
and
circling
back
to
prescott
hall
on
the
way
he
paused
momentarily
and
chuckled
the
reporters
unable
to
storm
the
faculty
club
had
gone
off
in
chase
of
other
game
and
had
cornered
lloyd
whitburn
in
front
of
administration
center
they
had
a
jeep
with
a
mounted
on
it
and
were
trying
to
get
something
for
telecast
after
gesticulating
angrily
whitburn
broke
away
from
them
and
dashed
up
the
steps
and
into
the
building
a
campus
policeman
stopped
those
who
tried
to
follow
his
only
afternoon
class
was
american
history
iii
he
got
through
it
somehow
though
the
class
was
able
to
concentrate
on
the
reconstruction
and
the
first
election
of
grover
cleveland
the
halls
were
free
of
reporters
at
least
and
when
it
was
over
he
hurried
to
the
library
going
to
the
faculty
in
the
rear
where
he
could
smoke
there
was
nobody
there
but
old
max
pottgeiter
smoking
a
cigar
his
head
bent
over
a
book
the
medieval
history
professor
looked
up
oh
hello
chalmers
what
the
deuce
is
going
on
around
here
has
everybody
gone
suddenly
crazy
he
asked
well
they
seem
to
think
i
have
he
said
bitterly
they
do
stupid
of
them
what
all
this
about
some
arab
being
shot
i
did
know
there
were
any
arabs
around
here
not
here
at
basra
he
told
pottgeiter
what
had
happened
well
i
sorry
to
hear
about
that
the
old
man
said
i
have
a
friend
at
southern
california
bellingham
who
knew
khalid
very
well
was
in
the
middle
east
doing
some
research
on
the
byzantine
empire
khalid
was
most
helpful
bellingham
was
quite
impressed
by
him
said
he
was
a
wonderful
man
and
a
fine
scholar
why
would
anybody
want
to
kill
a
man
like
that
he
explained
in
general
terms
pottgeiter
nodded
understandingly
assassination
was
a
familiar
feature
of
the
medieval
political
landscape
too
chalmers
went
on
to
elaborate
it
was
a
relief
to
talk
to
somebody
like
pottgeiter
who
was
bothered
by
the
present
moment
but
simply
boycotted
it
eventually
the
rang
pottgeiter
looked
at
his
watch
as
from
conditioned
reflex
and
then
rose
saying
that
he
had
a
class
and
excusing
himself
he
would
have
carried
his
cigar
with
him
if
chalmers
had
taken
it
away
from
him
after
pottgeiter
had
gone
chalmers
opened
a
book
he
did
notice
what
it
was
and
sat
staring
unseeing
at
the
pages
so
the
moving
had
come
down
on
the
end
of
khalid
hussein
life
what
were
the
events
in
the
next
segment
of
time
and
the
segments
to
follow
there
would
be
bloody
fighting
all
over
the
middle
east
with
consternation
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
talking
about
that
to
pottgeiter
the
turkish
army
would
move
in
and
try
to
restore
order
there
would
be
more
trouble
in
northern
iran
the
indian
communists
would
invade
eastern
pakistan
and
then
the
general
war
so
long
dreaded
would
come
how
far
in
the
future
that
was
he
could
not
remember
nor
how
the
stalemate
that
had
so
far
prevented
it
would
be
broken
he
knew
that
today
and
for
years
before
nobody
had
dared
start
an
atomic
war
wars
now
were
marginal
skirmishes
like
the
one
in
indonesia
or
the
steady
underground
conflict
of
subversion
and
sabotage
that
had
come
to
be
called
the
subwar
and
with
the
united
states
already
in
possession
of
a
powerful
lunar
base
he
wished
he
could
remember
how
events
between
the
murder
of
khalid
and
the
thirty
day
war
had
been
spaced
chronologically
something
of
that
had
come
to
him
after
the
incident
in
modern
history
iv
and
he
had
driven
it
from
his
consciousness
he
did
dare
go
home
where
the
reporters
would
be
sure
to
find
him
he
simply
left
the
college
at
the
end
of
the
and
walked
without
conscious
direction
until
darkness
gathered
this
morning
when
he
had
seen
the
paper
he
had
said
and
had
actually
believed
that
the
news
of
the
murder
in
basra
would
put
an
end
to
the
trouble
that
had
started
a
month
ago
in
the
modern
history
class
it
had
the
trouble
it
seemed
was
only
beginning
and
with
the
newspapers
and
whitburn
and
fitch
it
could
go
on
forever
it
was
fully
dark
now
his
shadow
fell
ahead
of
him
on
the
sidewalk
lengthening
as
he
passed
under
and
beyond
a
vanishing
as
he
entered
the
stronger
light
of
the
one
ahead
the
windows
of
a
cheap
cafe
reminded
him
that
he
was
hungry
and
he
entered
going
to
a
table
and
ordering
something
absently
there
was
a
television
screen
over
the
combination
bar
and
some
kind
of
a
comedy
programme
at
which
an
invisible
was
laughing
immoderately
and
without
apparent
cause
the
roughly
dressed
customers
along
the
counter
did
seem
to
see
any
more
humor
in
it
than
he
did
then
his
food
arrived
on
the
table
and
he
began
to
eat
without
really
tasting
it
after
a
while
an
alteration
in
the
noises
from
the
television
penetrated
his
consciousness
a
had
come
on
and
he
raised
his
head
the
screen
showed
a
square
in
an
eastern
city
the
voice
was
saying
basra
where
khalid
hussein
was
assassinated
early
this
morning
early
afternoon
local
time
this
is
the
scene
of
the
crime
the
body
of
the
murderer
has
been
removed
but
you
can
still
see
the
stones
with
which
he
was
pelted
to
death
by
the
mob
a
of
the
square
still
littered
with
a
caliphate
army
officer
displaying
the
weapon
it
was
an
old
all
right
chalmers
had
used
one
of
those
things
himself
thirty
years
before
and
he
and
his
contemporaries
had
called
it
a
there
were
some
recent
pictures
of
khalid
including
one
taken
as
he
left
the
plane
on
his
return
from
ankara
he
watched
absorbed
it
was
all
exactly
as
he
had
remembered
a
month
ago
it
gratified
him
to
see
that
his
future
memories
were
reliable
in
detail
as
well
as
generality
but
the
most
amazing
part
of
the
story
comes
not
from
basra
but
from
blanley
college
in
california
the
commentator
was
saying
where
it
is
revealed
the
murder
of
khalid
was
foretold
with
uncanny
accuracy
a
month
ago
by
a
history
professor
doctor
edward
chalmers
there
was
a
picture
of
himself
in
hat
and
overcoat
perfectly
motionless
as
though
a
brief
moving
glimpse
were
being
prolonged
a
glance
at
the
background
told
him
when
and
where
it
had
been
taken
a
year
and
a
half
ago
at
a
convention
at
harvard
these
telecast
people
must
save
up
every
inch
of
old
they
ever
took
there
were
views
of
blanley
campus
and
interviews
with
some
of
the
modern
history
iv
boys
including
dacre
and
kendrick
that
was
one
of
the
things
they
been
doing
with
that
this
afternoon
then
the
boys
some
brashly
some
embarrassedly
were
substantiating
the
fact
that
he
had
a
month
ago
described
yesterday
event
in
detail
there
was
an
interview
with
leonard
fitch
the
psychology
professor
was
trying
to
explain
the
phenomenon
of
precognition
in
layman
terms
and
making
heavy
going
of
it
and
there
was
the
mobbing
of
whitburn
in
front
of
administration
center
the
college
president
was
shouting
denials
of
every
question
asked
him
and
as
he
turned
and
fled
the
guffaws
of
the
reporters
were
plainly
audible
an
argument
broke
out
along
the
counter
i
do
believe
it
how
could
anybody
know
all
that
about
something
before
it
happened
well
you
heard
professor
what
was
his
name
an
you
heard
all
them
boys
ah
they
do
anything
for
a
joke
after
refusing
to
be
interviewed
for
telecast
the
president
of
blanley
college
finally
consented
to
hold
a
press
conference
in
his
office
from
which
telecast
cameras
were
barred
he
denied
the
whole
story
categorically
and
stated
that
the
boys
in
professor
class
had
concocted
the
whole
thing
as
a
hoax
there
see
what
i
told
you
stating
that
professor
chalmers
is
mentally
unsound
and
that
he
has
been
trying
for
years
to
oust
him
from
his
position
on
the
blanley
faculty
but
has
been
unable
to
do
so
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
faculty
tenure
act
of
most
of
his
remarks
were
in
the
nature
of
a
polemic
against
this
law
generally
regarded
as
the
college
professors
bill
of
rights
it
is
to
be
stated
here
that
other
members
of
the
blanley
faculty
have
unconditionally
confirmed
the
fact
that
doctor
chalmers
did
make
the
statements
attributed
to
him
a
month
ago
long
before
the
death
of
khalid
hussein
yah
how
about
now
gon
na
get
around
beckoning
the
waitress
he
paid
his
check
and
hurried
out
before
he
reached
the
door
he
heard
a
voice
almost
stuttering
with
excitement
hey
look
that
he
began
to
run
he
was
two
blocks
from
the
cafe
before
he
slowed
to
a
walk
again
that
night
he
needed
three
shots
of
whiskey
before
he
could
get
to
sleep
a
delegation
from
the
american
institute
of
psionics
and
parapsychology
reached
blanley
that
morning
having
taken
a
from
the
east
coast
they
had
academic
titles
and
degrees
that
even
lloyd
whitburn
could
ignore
they
talked
with
leonard
fitch
and
with
the
students
from
modern
history
iv
and
took
statements
it
was
until
after
general
european
history
ii
that
they
caught
up
with
chalmers
an
elderly
man
with
white
hair
and
a
ruddy
face
a
young
man
who
looked
like
a
boxer
a
man
in
tweeds
who
smoked
a
pipe
and
looked
as
though
he
ought
to
be
more
interested
in
and
than
in
clairvoyance
and
telepathy
the
names
of
the
first
two
meant
nothing
to
chalmers
they
were
important
names
in
their
own
field
but
it
was
not
his
field
the
name
of
the
third
who
listened
silently
he
did
not
catch
you
understand
gentlemen
that
i
having
some
difficulties
with
the
college
administration
about
this
he
told
them
president
whitburn
has
even
gone
so
far
as
to
challenge
my
fitness
to
hold
a
position
here
we
talked
to
him
the
elderly
man
said
it
was
not
a
very
satisfactory
discussion
president
whitburn
fitness
to
hold
his
own
position
could
very
easily
be
challenged
the
young
man
added
pugnaciously
well
then
you
see
what
my
position
is
i
consulted
my
attorney
weill
and
he
has
advised
me
to
make
absolutely
no
statements
of
any
sort
about
the
matter
i
understand
the
eldest
of
the
trio
said
but
we
not
the
press
or
anything
like
that
we
can
assure
you
that
anything
you
tell
us
will
be
absolutely
confidential
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
man
in
tweeds
who
nodded
silently
we
can
understand
that
the
students
in
your
modern
history
class
are
telling
what
is
substantially
the
truth
if
you
thinking
about
that
hoax
statement
of
whitburn
that
a
lot
of
idiotic
drivel
he
said
angrily
i
heard
some
of
those
boys
on
the
telecast
last
night
except
for
a
few
details
in
which
they
were
confused
they
all
stated
exactly
what
they
heard
me
say
in
class
a
month
ago
and
we
assume
again
he
glanced
at
the
man
in
tweeds
that
you
had
no
opportunity
of
knowing
anything
at
the
time
about
any
actual
plot
against
khalid
life
the
man
in
tweeds
broke
silence
for
the
first
time
you
can
assume
that
i
do
even
think
this
fellow
noureed
knew
anything
about
it
then
well
we
like
to
know
as
nearly
as
you
able
to
tell
us
just
how
you
became
the
percipient
of
this
knowledge
of
the
future
event
of
the
death
of
khalid
hussein
the
young
man
began
was
it
through
a
dream
or
a
waking
experience
did
you
visualize
or
have
an
auditory
impression
or
did
it
simply
come
into
your
mind
i
sorry
gentlemen
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
to
be
going
somewhere
at
once
in
any
case
i
simply
ca
discuss
the
matter
with
you
i
appreciate
your
position
i
know
how
i
feel
if
data
of
historical
importance
were
being
withheld
from
me
however
i
trust
that
you
will
appreciate
my
position
and
spare
me
any
further
questioning
that
was
all
he
allowed
them
to
get
out
of
him
they
spent
another
few
minutes
being
polite
to
one
another
he
invited
them
to
lunch
at
the
faculty
club
and
learned
that
they
were
lunching
there
as
guests
they
went
away
trying
to
hide
their
disappointment
the
psionics
and
parapsychology
people
were
the
only
delegation
to
reach
blanley
that
day
enough
of
the
trustees
of
the
college
lived
in
the
san
francisco
area
to
muster
a
quorum
for
a
meeting
the
evening
before
a
committee
including
james
dacre
the
father
of
the
boy
in
modern
history
iv
was
appointed
to
get
the
facts
at
first
hand
they
arrived
about
noon
they
talked
to
some
of
the
students
spent
some
time
closeted
with
whitburn
and
were
seen
crossing
the
campus
with
the
parapsychology
people
they
did
talk
to
chalmers
or
fitch
in
the
afternoon
marjorie
fenner
told
chalmers
that
his
presence
at
a
meeting
to
be
held
that
evening
in
whitburn
office
was
requested
the
request
she
said
had
come
from
the
trustees
committee
not
from
whitburn
she
also
told
him
that
fitch
would
be
there
chalmers
promptly
phoned
stanly
weill
i
be
there
along
with
you
the
lawyer
said
if
this
committee
is
running
it
they
realize
that
this
is
a
matter
in
which
you
entitled
to
legal
advice
i
stop
by
your
place
and
pick
you
up
you
have
been
doing
any
talking
have
you
he
described
the
interview
with
the
psionics
and
parapsychology
people
that
was
all
right
was
there
a
man
with
a
mustache
in
a
brown
tweed
suit
with
them
yes
i
did
catch
his
name
it
cutler
he
an
army
major
central
intelligence
his
interested
in
whether
you
had
any
real
advance
information
on
this
he
was
in
to
see
me
just
a
while
ago
i
have
the
impression
he
like
to
see
this
whole
thing
played
down
so
he
be
on
our
side
more
or
less
and
for
the
time
being
i
be
around
to
your
place
about
eight
in
the
meantime
do
do
any
more
talking
than
you
have
to
i
hope
we
can
get
this
straightened
out
this
evening
i
have
to
go
to
reno
in
a
day
or
so
to
see
a
client
there
the
meeting
in
whitburn
office
had
been
set
for
weill
saw
to
it
that
they
arrived
exactly
on
time
as
they
got
out
of
his
car
at
administration
center
and
crossed
to
the
steps
chalmers
had
the
feeling
of
going
to
a
duel
accompanied
by
his
second
the
briefcase
weill
was
carrying
may
have
given
him
the
idea
it
was
flat
and
the
size
and
shape
of
an
old
case
of
dueling
pistols
he
commented
on
it
sound
recorder
weill
said
loaded
with
a
spool
no
matter
how
long
this
thing
lasts
i
have
a
record
of
it
if
i
want
to
produce
one
in
court
another
party
was
arriving
at
the
same
time
the
two
psionics
and
parapsychology
people
and
the
intelligence
major
who
seemed
to
have
formed
a
working
partnership
they
all
entered
together
after
a
brief
and
guardedly
polite
exchange
of
greetings
there
were
voices
raised
in
argument
inside
when
they
came
to
whitburn
office
the
college
president
was
trying
to
keep
handley
tom
smith
and
max
pottgeiter
from
entering
his
private
room
in
the
rear
it
certainly
is
handley
was
saying
as
faculty
members
any
controversy
involving
establishment
of
standards
of
fitness
to
teach
under
a
concerns
all
of
us
because
any
action
taken
in
this
case
may
establish
a
precedent
which
could
affect
the
validity
of
our
own
contracts
a
big
man
with
hair
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
private
office
behind
whitburn
james
dacre
these
gentlemen
have
a
substantial
interest
in
this
doctor
whitburn
he
said
if
they
here
as
representatives
of
the
college
faculty
they
have
every
right
to
be
present
whitburn
stood
aside
handley
smith
and
pottgeiter
went
through
the
door
the
others
followed
the
other
three
members
of
the
committee
were
already
in
the
room
a
few
minutes
later
leonard
fitch
arrived
also
carrying
a
briefcase
well
everybody
seems
to
be
here
whitburn
said
starting
toward
his
chair
behind
the
desk
we
might
as
well
get
this
started
yes
if
you
excuse
me
doctor
dacre
stepped
in
front
of
him
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
i
been
selected
as
chairman
of
this
committee
i
believe
i
presiding
here
start
the
recorder
somebody
one
of
the
other
trustees
went
to
the
sound
recorder
beside
the
desk
a
larger
but
probably
not
more
efficient
instrument
than
the
one
weill
had
concealed
in
his
briefcase
and
flipped
a
switch
then
he
and
his
companions
dragged
up
chairs
to
flank
dacre
and
the
rest
seated
themselves
around
the
room
old
pottgeiter
took
a
seat
next
to
chalmers
weill
opened
the
case
on
his
lap
reached
inside
and
closed
it
again
what
are
they
trying
to
do
ed
pottgeiter
asked
in
a
loud
whisper
throw
you
off
the
faculty
they
ca
do
that
can
they
i
do
know
max
we
see
this
is
any
formal
hearing
and
nobody
on
trial
here
dacre
was
saying
any
action
will
have
to
be
taken
by
the
board
of
trustees
as
a
whole
at
a
regularly
scheduled
meeting
all
we
trying
to
do
is
find
out
just
what
happened
here
and
who
if
anybody
is
responsible
well
there
the
man
who
responsible
whitburn
cried
pointing
at
chalmers
this
whole
thing
grew
out
of
his
behavior
in
class
a
month
ago
and
i
remind
you
that
at
the
time
i
demanded
his
resignation
i
thought
it
was
doctor
fitch
here
who
gave
the
story
to
the
newspapers
one
of
the
trustees
a
man
with
red
hair
and
a
thin
eyeglassed
face
objected
doctor
fitch
acted
as
any
scientist
should
in
making
public
what
he
believed
to
be
an
important
scientific
discovery
the
elder
of
the
two
parapsychology
men
said
he
believed
and
so
do
we
that
he
had
discovered
a
significant
instance
of
precognition
a
case
of
real
prior
knowledge
of
a
future
event
he
made
a
careful
and
systematic
record
of
professor
chalmers
statements
at
least
two
weeks
before
the
occurrence
of
the
event
to
which
they
referred
it
is
entirely
due
to
him
that
we
know
exactly
what
professor
chalmers
said
and
when
he
said
it
yes
his
younger
colleague
added
and
in
all
my
experience
never
heard
anything
more
preposterous
than
this
man
attempt
yesterday
to
deny
the
fact
well
we
convinced
that
doctor
chalmers
did
in
fact
say
what
alleged
to
have
said
last
month
dacre
began
jim
i
think
we
ought
to
get
that
established
for
the
record
another
of
the
trustees
put
in
doctor
chalmers
is
it
true
that
you
spoke
in
the
past
tense
about
the
death
of
khalid
hussein
in
one
of
your
classes
on
the
sixteenth
of
last
month
chalmers
rose
yes
it
is
and
the
next
day
i
was
called
into
this
room
by
doctor
whitburn
who
demanded
my
resignation
from
the
faculty
of
this
college
because
of
it
now
what
i
like
to
know
is
why
did
doctor
whitburn
in
this
same
room
deny
yesterday
that
i
said
anything
of
the
sort
and
accuse
my
students
of
concocting
the
story
after
the
event
as
a
hoax
one
of
them
being
my
son
dacre
added
i
like
to
hear
an
answer
to
that
myself
so
would
i
stanly
weill
chimed
in
you
know
my
client
has
a
good
case
against
doctor
whitburn
for
libel
chalmers
looked
around
the
room
of
the
thirteen
men
around
him
only
whitburn
was
an
enemy
some
of
the
others
were
on
his
side
for
one
reason
or
another
but
none
of
them
were
friends
weill
was
his
lawyer
obeying
an
obligation
to
a
client
which
at
bottom
was
an
obligation
to
his
own
conscience
handley
was
afraid
of
the
possibility
that
a
precedent
might
be
established
which
would
impair
his
own
fitch
and
the
two
men
from
the
institute
of
psionics
and
parapsychology
were
interested
in
him
as
a
source
of
dacre
resented
a
slur
upon
his
son
he
and
the
others
were
interested
in
blanley
college
as
an
institution
almost
an
abstraction
and
the
major
in
mufti
was
probably
worrying
about
the
consequences
to
military
security
of
having
a
prophet
at
large
then
a
hand
gripped
his
shoulder
and
a
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
that
good
ed
do
let
them
scare
you
old
max
pottgeiter
at
least
was
a
friend
doctor
whitburn
i
asking
you
and
i
expect
an
answer
why
did
you
make
such
statements
to
the
press
when
you
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
were
false
dacre
demanded
sharply
i
knew
nothing
of
the
kind
whitburn
blustered
showing
under
the
bluster
fear
yes
i
demanded
this
man
resignation
on
the
morning
of
october
seventeenth
the
day
after
this
incident
occurred
it
had
come
to
my
attention
on
several
occasions
that
he
was
making
wild
and
unreasonable
assertions
in
class
and
subjecting
himself
and
with
himself
the
whole
faculty
of
this
college
to
student
ridicule
why
there
was
actually
an
editorial
about
it
written
by
the
student
editor
of
the
campus
paper
the
and
i
managed
to
prevent
its
publication
he
went
on
at
some
length
about
that
if
i
might
be
permitted
access
to
the
drawers
of
my
own
desk
he
added
with
elephantine
sarcasm
i
could
show
you
the
editorial
in
question
you
need
bother
i
have
a
carbon
copy
dacre
told
him
we
all
read
it
if
you
did
at
the
time
you
suppressed
it
you
should
have
known
what
doctor
chalmers
said
in
class
i
knew
he
talked
a
lot
of
poppycock
about
a
man
who
was
still
living
having
been
shot
to
death
whitburn
retorted
and
if
something
of
the
sort
actually
happened
what
of
it
somebody
always
taking
a
shot
at
one
or
another
of
these
foreign
dictators
and
they
ca
miss
all
the
time
you
claim
this
was
pure
coincidence
fitch
demanded
a
coincidence
event
of
assassination
year
of
the
event
place
circumstances
name
of
assassin
nationality
of
assassin
manner
of
killing
exact
type
of
weapon
used
guards
killed
and
wounded
along
with
khalid
and
fate
of
the
assassin
if
that
a
simple
and
plausible
coincidence
so
dealing
ten
royal
flushes
in
succession
in
a
poker
game
tom
you
figured
that
out
what
did
you
say
the
odds
against
it
were
was
all
that
actually
stated
by
doctor
chalmers
a
month
ago
one
of
the
trustees
asked
incredulously
it
absolutely
was
look
here
dacre
gentlemen
fitch
came
forward
unzipping
his
briefcase
and
pulling
out
papers
here
are
the
signed
statements
of
each
of
doctor
chalmers
modern
history
four
students
all
made
and
dated
before
the
assassination
you
can
refer
to
them
as
you
please
they
in
alphabetical
order
and
here
he
unfolded
a
sheet
of
graph
paper
a
yard
long
and
almost
as
wide
here
a
tabulated
summary
of
the
boys
statements
all
agreed
on
the
first
point
the
fact
of
the
assassination
all
agreed
that
the
time
was
sometime
this
year
twenty
out
of
agreed
on
basra
as
the
place
why
seven
of
them
even
remembered
the
name
of
the
assassin
that
in
itself
is
remarkable
doctor
chalmers
has
an
extremely
intelligent
and
attentive
class
they
attentive
because
they
know
he
always
likely
to
do
something
crazy
and
make
a
circus
out
of
himself
whitburn
interjected
and
this
is
the
only
instance
of
doctor
chalmers
precognitive
ability
fitch
continued
there
have
been
a
number
of
other
cases
chalmers
jumped
to
his
feet
stanly
weill
rose
beside
him
shoved
the
cased
into
his
hands
and
pushed
him
back
into
his
seat
gentlemen
the
lawyer
began
quietly
but
firmly
and
clearly
this
is
all
getting
pretty
badly
out
of
hand
after
all
this
is
an
investigation
of
the
actuality
of
precognition
as
a
psychic
phenomenon
what
i
like
to
hear
and
what
i
have
heard
yet
is
doctor
whitburn
explanation
of
his
contradictory
statements
that
he
knew
about
my
client
alleged
remarks
on
the
evening
after
they
were
supposed
to
have
been
made
and
that
at
the
same
time
the
whole
thing
was
a
hoax
concocted
by
his
students
are
you
implying
that
i
a
liar
whitburn
bristled
i
pointing
out
that
you
made
a
pair
of
contradictory
statements
and
i
asking
how
you
could
do
that
knowingly
and
honestly
weill
retorted
what
i
meant
whitburn
began
with
exaggerated
slowness
as
though
speaking
to
an
idiot
was
that
yesterday
when
those
infernal
reporters
were
badgering
me
i
really
thought
that
some
of
professor
chalmers
students
had
gotten
together
and
given
the
an
exaggerated
story
about
his
insane
maunderings
a
month
ago
i
imagined
that
a
member
of
the
faculty
had
been
so
lacking
in
loyalty
to
the
college
you
could
imagine
anybody
with
any
more
intellectual
integrity
than
you
have
fitch
fairly
yelled
at
him
you
as
crazy
as
chalmers
whitburn
yelled
back
he
turned
to
the
trustees
you
see
the
position
i
in
here
with
this
infernal
higher
education
faculty
tenure
act
i
have
a
madman
on
my
faculty
and
can
i
get
rid
of
him
no
i
demand
his
resignation
and
he
laughs
at
me
and
goes
running
for
his
lawyer
and
he
is
a
madman
nobody
but
a
madman
would
talk
the
way
he
does
you
think
this
khalid
hussein
business
is
the
only
time
he
done
anything
like
this
why
i
have
a
list
of
a
dozen
occasions
when
he
done
something
just
as
bad
only
he
did
have
a
lucky
coincidence
to
back
him
up
trying
to
get
books
that
do
exist
out
of
the
library
and
then
insisting
that
they
standard
textbooks
talking
about
the
revolt
of
the
colonies
on
mars
and
venus
talking
about
something
he
calls
the
terran
federation
some
kind
of
a
world
empire
or
something
he
calls
operation
triple
cross
that
saved
the
country
during
some
fantastic
war
he
imagined
did
you
say
the
question
cracked
out
like
a
string
of
pistol
shots
everybody
turned
the
quiet
man
in
the
brown
tweed
suit
had
spoken
now
he
looked
as
though
he
were
very
much
regretting
it
is
there
such
a
thing
as
operation
triple
cross
fitch
was
asking
no
no
i
never
heard
anything
about
that
that
was
what
i
meant
it
was
this
terran
federation
thing
the
major
said
a
trifle
too
quickly
and
too
smoothly
he
turned
to
chalmers
you
never
did
any
work
for
pspb
did
you
ever
talk
to
anybody
who
did
he
asked
i
do
even
know
what
the
letters
mean
chalmers
replied
planning
board
it
all
pretty
but
this
term
terran
federation
is
a
tentative
name
for
a
proposed
organization
to
take
the
place
of
the
if
that
organization
breaks
up
it
nothing
particularly
important
and
it
only
exists
on
paper
it
wo
exist
only
on
paper
very
long
chalmers
thought
he
was
wondering
what
operation
triple
cross
was
he
had
some
notes
on
it
but
he
had
forgotten
what
they
were
maybe
he
did
pick
that
up
from
somebody
who
talked
indiscreetly
whitburn
conceded
but
the
rest
of
this
tommyrot
why
he
was
talking
about
how
the
city
of
reno
had
been
destroyed
by
an
explosion
and
fire
literally
wiped
off
the
map
there
an
example
for
you
he
forgotten
about
that
too
it
had
been
a
relatively
minor
incident
in
the
secret
struggle
of
the
subwar
now
he
remembered
having
made
a
note
about
it
he
was
sure
that
it
followed
closely
after
the
assassination
of
khalid
hussein
he
turned
quickly
to
weill
did
you
say
you
had
to
go
to
reno
in
a
day
or
so
he
asked
weill
hushed
him
urgently
pointing
with
his
free
hand
to
the
recorder
the
exchange
prevented
him
from
noticing
that
max
pottgeiter
had
risen
until
the
old
man
was
speaking
are
you
trying
to
tell
these
people
that
professor
chalmers
is
crazy
he
was
demanding
why
he
has
one
of
the
best
minds
on
the
campus
i
was
talking
to
him
only
yesterday
in
the
back
room
at
the
library
you
know
he
went
on
apologetically
my
subject
is
medieval
history
i
do
pay
much
attention
to
what
going
on
in
the
contemporary
world
and
i
did
understand
really
what
all
this
excitement
was
about
but
he
explained
the
whole
thing
to
me
and
did
it
in
terms
that
i
could
grasp
drawing
some
excellent
parallels
with
the
byzantine
empire
and
the
crusades
all
about
the
revolt
at
damascus
and
the
sack
of
beirut
and
the
war
between
jordan
and
saudi
arabia
and
how
the
turkish
army
intervened
and
the
invasion
of
pakistan
when
did
all
this
happen
one
of
the
trustees
demanded
pottgeiter
started
to
explain
chalmers
realized
sickly
how
much
of
his
future
history
he
had
poured
into
the
trusting
ear
of
the
old
medievalist
the
day
before
good
lord
man
do
you
read
the
papers
at
all
another
of
the
trustees
asked
no
and
i
do
read
magazines
or
science
fiction
i
read
carefully
substantiated
facts
and
i
know
when
i
talking
to
a
sane
and
reasonable
man
it
is
a
common
experience
around
here
dacre
passed
a
hand
over
his
face
doctor
whitburn
he
said
i
must
admit
that
i
came
to
this
meeting
strongly
prejudiced
against
you
and
i
further
admit
that
your
own
behavior
here
has
done
very
little
to
dispel
that
prejudice
but
i
beginning
to
get
some
idea
of
what
you
have
to
contend
with
here
at
blanley
and
i
find
that
i
must
make
a
lot
of
allowances
i
had
no
idea
simply
no
idea
at
all
look
you
getting
a
completely
distorted
picture
of
this
dacre
fitch
broke
in
it
precisely
as
i
believed
doctor
chalmers
is
an
unusually
gifted
precognitive
percipient
you
seen
gentlemen
how
his
complicated
chain
of
precognitions
about
the
death
of
khalid
has
been
proven
veridical
i
stake
my
life
that
every
one
of
these
precognitions
will
be
similarly
verified
and
i
stake
my
professional
reputation
that
the
man
is
perfectly
sane
of
course
abnormal
psychology
and
psychopathology
are
my
subjects
but
they
not
my
subjects
either
whitburn
retorted
but
i
know
a
lunatic
by
his
ravings
doctor
fitch
is
taking
an
entirely
proper
attitude
pottgeiter
said
in
pointing
out
that
abnormal
psychology
is
a
specialized
branch
outside
his
own
field
i
would
dream
myself
of
trying
to
offer
a
decisive
opinion
on
some
point
of
roman
or
babylonian
history
well
if
the
question
of
doctor
chalmers
sanity
is
at
issue
here
consult
somebody
who
specializes
in
insanity
i
do
believe
that
anybody
here
is
qualified
even
to
express
an
opinion
on
that
subject
doctor
whitburn
least
of
all
whitburn
turned
on
him
angrily
oh
shut
up
you
doddering
old
fool
he
shouted
look
there
another
of
them
he
told
the
trustees
another
deadhead
on
the
faculty
that
this
tenure
law
keeps
me
from
getting
rid
of
he
as
bad
as
chalmers
himself
you
just
heard
that
string
of
nonsense
he
was
spouting
why
his
courses
have
been
noted
among
the
students
for
years
as
snap
courses
in
which
nobody
ever
has
to
do
any
work
chalmers
was
on
his
feet
again
thoroughly
angry
abuse
of
himself
he
could
take
talking
that
way
about
gentle
learned
old
pottgeiter
was
something
else
i
think
doctor
pottgeiter
said
the
most
reasonable
thing
i
heard
since
i
came
in
here
he
declared
if
my
sanity
is
to
be
questioned
i
insist
that
it
be
questioned
by
somebody
qualified
to
do
so
illustration
had
the
sane
restrained
the
insane
or
was
it
the
other
way
around
weill
set
his
recorder
on
the
floor
and
jumped
up
beside
him
trying
to
haul
him
back
into
his
seat
for
god
sake
man
sit
down
and
shut
up
he
hissed
chalmers
shook
off
his
hand
no
i
wo
shut
up
this
is
the
only
way
to
settle
this
once
and
for
all
and
when
my
sanity
been
vindicated
i
going
to
sue
this
fellow
whitburn
started
to
make
some
retort
then
stopped
short
after
a
moment
he
smiled
nastily
do
i
understand
doctor
chalmers
that
you
would
be
willing
to
submit
to
psychiatric
examination
he
asked
do
agree
you
putting
your
foot
in
a
trap
weill
told
him
urgently
of
course
i
agree
as
long
as
the
examination
is
conducted
by
a
properly
qualified
psychiatrist
how
about
doctor
hauserman
at
northern
state
mental
hospital
whitburn
asked
quickly
would
you
agree
to
an
examination
by
him
excellent
fitch
exclaimed
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
field
accept
his
opinion
unreservedly
weill
started
to
object
again
chalmers
cut
him
off
doctor
hauserman
will
be
quite
satisfactory
to
me
the
only
question
is
would
he
be
available
i
think
he
would
dacre
said
glancing
at
his
watch
i
wonder
if
he
could
be
reached
now
he
got
to
his
feet
telephone
in
your
outer
office
doctor
whitburn
fine
if
you
gentlemen
will
excuse
me
it
was
a
good
fifteen
minutes
before
he
returned
smiling
well
gentlemen
it
all
arranged
he
said
doctor
hauserman
is
quite
willing
to
examine
doctor
chalmers
with
the
latter
consent
of
course
he
have
it
in
writing
if
he
wishes
yes
i
assured
him
on
that
point
he
be
here
about
noon
tomorrow
it
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
hospital
but
the
doctor
flies
his
own
plane
and
the
examination
can
start
at
two
in
the
afternoon
he
seems
familiar
with
the
facilities
of
the
psychology
department
here
i
assured
him
that
they
were
at
his
disposal
will
that
be
satisfactory
to
you
doctor
chalmers
i
have
a
class
at
that
time
but
one
of
the
instructors
can
take
it
over
if
holding
classes
will
be
possible
around
here
tomorrow
he
said
now
if
you
gentlemen
will
pardon
me
i
think
i
go
home
and
get
some
sleep
weill
came
up
to
the
apartment
with
him
he
mixed
a
couple
of
drinks
and
they
went
into
the
living
room
with
them
just
in
case
you
do
know
what
you
gotten
yourself
into
weill
said
this
hauserman
is
any
ordinary
he
the
state
psychiatrist
if
he
gets
the
idea
you
are
sane
he
can
commit
you
to
a
hospital
and
i
bet
that
exactly
what
whitburn
had
in
mind
when
he
suggested
him
and
i
do
trust
this
man
dacre
i
thought
he
was
on
our
side
at
the
start
but
that
was
before
your
friends
got
into
the
act
he
frowned
into
his
drink
and
i
do
like
the
way
that
intelligence
major
was
acting
toward
the
last
if
he
thinks
you
know
something
you
are
not
supposed
to
a
mental
hospital
may
be
his
idea
of
a
good
place
to
put
you
away
you
do
think
this
man
hauserman
would
allow
himself
to
be
influenced
no
you
just
do
think
i
sane
do
you
i
know
what
hauserman
think
he
think
this
future
history
business
is
a
classical
case
of
systematized
schizoid
delusion
i
wish
i
never
gotten
into
this
case
i
wish
i
never
even
heard
of
you
and
another
thing
in
case
you
get
past
hauserman
all
right
you
can
forget
about
that
bluff
of
mine
you
would
not
stand
a
chance
with
it
in
court
in
spite
of
what
happened
to
khalid
after
tomorrow
i
wo
stay
in
the
same
room
with
anybody
who
even
mentions
that
name
to
me
well
win
or
lose
it
be
over
tomorrow
and
then
i
can
leave
here
did
you
tell
me
you
were
going
to
reno
chalmers
asked
do
do
it
you
remember
whitburn
mentioning
how
i
spoke
about
an
explosion
there
it
happened
just
a
couple
of
days
after
the
murder
of
khalid
there
was
will
be
a
trainload
of
high
explosives
in
the
railroad
yard
it
be
the
biggest
explosion
since
the
blew
up
in
halifax
harbor
in
world
war
one
weill
threw
his
drink
into
the
fire
he
must
have
avoided
throwing
the
glass
in
with
it
by
a
exercise
of
well
he
said
after
a
brief
struggle
to
master
himself
one
thing
about
the
legal
profession
you
do
hear
the
damnedest
things
good
night
professor
and
try
please
try
for
the
sake
of
your
poor
harried
lawyer
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
about
things
like
that
at
least
till
after
you
get
through
with
hauserman
and
when
talking
to
him
do
do
for
heaven
sake
volunteer
anything
the
room
was
a
pleasant
place
there
was
a
desk
much
like
the
ones
in
the
classrooms
and
six
or
seven
wicker
armchairs
a
lot
of
apparatus
had
been
pushed
back
along
the
walls
the
were
gay
cretonne
there
was
a
couch
with
more
apparatus
similarly
covered
beside
it
hauserman
was
seated
at
the
desk
when
chalmers
entered
he
rose
and
they
shook
hands
a
man
of
about
his
own
age
partially
bald
chalmers
tried
to
guess
something
of
the
man
nature
from
his
face
but
could
read
nothing
a
face
well
trained
to
keep
its
owner
secrets
something
to
smoke
professor
he
began
offering
his
cigarette
case
my
pipe
if
you
do
mind
he
got
it
out
and
filled
it
any
of
those
chairs
hauserman
said
gesturing
toward
them
they
were
all
arranged
to
face
the
desk
he
sat
down
lighting
his
pipe
hauserman
nodded
approvingly
he
was
behaving
calmly
and
need
being
put
at
ease
they
talked
at
random
at
least
hauserman
tried
to
make
it
seem
so
for
some
time
about
his
work
his
book
about
the
french
revolution
current
events
he
picked
his
way
carefully
through
the
conversation
alert
for
traps
which
the
psychiatrist
might
be
laying
for
him
finally
hauserman
said
would
you
mind
telling
me
just
why
you
felt
it
advisable
to
request
a
psychiatric
examination
professor
i
did
request
it
but
when
the
suggestion
was
made
by
one
of
my
friends
in
reply
to
some
aspersions
of
my
sanity
i
agreed
to
it
good
distinction
and
why
was
your
sanity
questioned
i
wo
deny
that
i
had
heard
of
this
affair
here
before
dacre
called
me
last
evening
but
i
like
to
hear
your
version
of
it
he
went
into
that
from
the
original
incident
in
modern
history
iv
choosing
every
word
carefully
trying
to
concentrate
on
making
a
good
impression
upon
hauserman
and
at
the
same
time
finding
that
more
memories
of
the
future
were
beginning
to
seep
past
the
barrier
of
his
consciousness
he
tried
to
dam
them
back
when
he
could
not
he
spoke
with
greater
and
greater
care
lest
they
leak
into
his
speech
i
ca
recall
the
exact
manner
in
which
i
blundered
into
it
the
fact
that
i
did
make
such
a
blunder
was
because
i
was
talking
extemporaneously
and
had
wandered
ahead
of
my
text
i
was
trying
to
show
the
results
of
the
collapse
of
the
ottoman
empire
after
the
first
world
war
and
the
partition
of
the
middle
east
into
a
loose
collection
of
arab
states
and
the
passing
of
british
and
other
european
spheres
of
influence
following
the
second
you
know
when
you
consider
it
the
islamic
caliphate
was
inevitable
the
surprising
thing
is
that
it
was
created
by
a
man
like
khalid
he
was
talking
to
gain
time
and
he
suspected
that
hauserman
knew
it
the
memories
were
coming
into
his
mind
more
and
more
strongly
it
was
impossible
to
suppress
them
the
period
of
anarchy
following
khalid
death
would
be
much
briefer
and
much
more
violent
than
he
had
previously
thought
tallal
khalid
would
be
flying
from
england
even
now
perhaps
he
had
already
left
the
plane
to
take
refuge
among
the
black
tents
of
his
father
bedouins
the
revolt
at
damascus
would
break
out
before
the
end
of
the
month
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
whole
of
syria
and
lebanon
would
be
in
bloody
chaos
and
the
turkish
army
would
be
on
the
march
yes
and
you
allowed
yourself
to
be
carried
a
little
beyond
the
present
moment
into
the
future
without
realizing
it
is
that
it
something
like
that
he
replied
wide
awake
to
the
trap
hauserman
had
set
and
fearful
that
it
might
be
a
blind
to
disguise
the
real
trap
history
follows
certain
patterns
i
not
a
toynbean
by
any
manner
of
means
but
any
historian
can
see
that
certain
forces
generally
tend
to
produce
similar
effects
for
instance
space
travel
is
now
a
fact
our
government
has
at
present
a
military
base
on
luna
within
our
lifetimes
certainly
within
the
lifetimes
of
my
students
there
will
be
explorations
and
attempts
at
colonization
on
mars
and
venus
you
believe
that
doctor
oh
unreservedly
i
not
supposed
to
talk
about
it
but
i
did
some
work
on
the
philadelphia
project
myself
i
say
that
every
major
problem
of
interplanetary
flight
had
been
solved
before
the
first
robot
rocket
was
landed
on
luna
yes
and
when
mars
and
venus
are
colonized
there
will
be
the
same
historic
situations
at
least
in
general
shape
as
arose
when
the
european
powers
were
colonizing
the
new
world
or
for
that
matter
when
the
greek
were
throwing
out
colonies
across
the
aegean
that
the
sort
of
thing
we
call
projecting
the
past
into
the
future
through
the
present
hauserman
nodded
but
how
about
the
details
things
like
the
assassination
of
a
specific
personage
how
can
you
extrapolate
to
a
thing
like
that
well
more
memories
were
coming
to
the
surface
he
tried
to
crowd
them
back
i
do
my
projecting
in
what
you
might
call
fictionalized
form
try
to
fill
in
the
details
from
imagination
in
the
case
of
khalid
i
was
trying
to
imagine
what
would
happen
if
his
influence
were
suddenly
removed
from
near
eastern
and
middle
eastern
affairs
i
suppose
i
constructed
an
imaginary
scene
of
his
assassination
he
went
on
at
length
mohammed
and
noureed
were
common
enough
names
the
middle
east
was
full
of
old
weapons
stoning
was
the
traditional
method
of
execution
it
diffused
responsibility
so
that
no
individual
could
be
singled
out
for
vengeance
you
have
no
idea
how
disturbed
i
was
when
the
whole
thing
happened
exactly
as
i
had
described
it
he
continued
and
worst
of
all
to
me
was
this
intelligence
officer
showing
up
i
thought
i
was
really
in
for
it
then
you
never
really
believed
that
you
had
real
knowledge
of
the
future
i
beginning
to
since
i
been
talking
to
these
psionics
and
parapsychology
people
he
laughed
it
sounded
he
hoped
like
a
natural
and
unaffected
laugh
they
seem
to
be
convinced
that
i
have
there
would
be
an
uprising
in
azerbaijan
by
the
middle
of
the
next
year
before
autumn
the
indian
communists
would
make
their
fatal
attempt
to
seize
east
pakistan
the
thirty
days
war
would
be
the
immediate
result
by
that
time
the
lunar
base
would
be
completed
and
ready
the
enemy
missiles
would
be
aimed
primarily
at
the
rocketports
from
which
it
was
supplied
delivered
without
warning
it
should
have
succeeded
except
that
every
rocketport
had
its
secret
duplicate
and
triplicate
that
was
operation
triple
cross
no
wonder
major
cutler
had
been
so
startled
at
the
words
last
evening
the
enemy
would
be
utterly
overwhelmed
under
the
rain
of
missiles
from
across
space
but
until
the
began
to
fall
the
united
states
would
suffer
grievously
honestly
though
i
feel
sorry
for
my
friend
fitch
he
added
going
to
be
frightfully
let
down
when
some
more
of
my
alleged
prophecies
misfire
on
him
but
i
really
have
been
deliberately
deceiving
him
and
blanley
college
was
at
the
center
of
one
of
the
areas
which
would
receive
the
worst
of
the
thermonuclear
hell
to
come
and
it
would
be
a
little
under
a
year
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
hauserman
exclaimed
annoyance
in
his
voice
i
amazed
that
this
man
whitburn
allowed
a
thing
like
this
to
assume
the
proportions
it
did
i
must
say
that
i
seem
to
have
gotten
the
story
about
this
business
in
a
very
garbled
form
indeed
he
laughed
shortly
i
came
here
convinced
that
you
were
mentally
unbalanced
i
hope
you
wo
take
that
the
wrong
way
professor
he
hastened
to
add
in
my
profession
anything
can
be
expected
a
good
psychiatrist
can
never
afford
to
forget
how
sharp
and
fine
is
the
the
the
words
startled
him
he
had
been
thinking
at
that
moment
of
the
slicing
moment
after
moment
relentlessly
away
from
the
future
into
the
past
at
each
slice
coming
closer
and
closer
to
the
moment
when
the
missiles
of
the
eastern
axis
would
fall
i
did
know
they
still
resorted
to
surgery
in
mental
cases
he
added
trying
to
cover
his
break
oh
no
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
as
irrevocably
discarded
as
the
whips
and
shackles
of
bedlam
i
meant
another
kind
of
the
thin
almost
invisible
line
which
separates
sanity
from
from
madness
to
use
a
deplorable
lay
expression
hauserman
lit
another
cigarette
most
minds
are
a
lot
closer
to
it
than
their
owners
suspect
too
in
fact
professor
i
was
so
convinced
that
yours
had
passed
over
it
that
i
brought
with
me
a
commitment
form
made
out
all
but
my
signature
for
you
he
took
it
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
desk
the
modern
equivalent
of
the
i
suppose
the
author
of
a
book
on
the
french
revolution
would
call
it
i
was
all
ready
to
certify
you
as
mentally
unsound
and
commit
you
to
northern
state
mental
hospital
chalmers
sat
erect
in
his
chair
he
knew
where
that
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
in
the
one
part
of
the
state
completely
untouched
by
the
of
the
thirty
days
war
why
the
town
outside
which
the
hospital
stood
had
been
a
military
headquarters
during
the
period
immediately
after
the
bombings
and
the
center
from
which
all
the
rescue
work
in
the
state
had
been
directed
and
you
thought
you
could
commit
me
to
northern
state
he
demanded
laughing
scornfully
and
this
time
he
did
try
to
make
the
laugh
sound
natural
and
unaffected
you
confine
anywhere
confine
a
poor
old
history
professor
body
yes
but
that
is
me
universal
i
exist
in
all
when
this
old
body
i
wearing
now
was
writing
that
book
on
the
french
revolution
i
was
in
paris
watching
it
happen
from
the
fall
of
the
bastile
to
the
ninth
thermidor
i
was
in
basra
and
saw
that
crazed
tool
of
the
axis
shoot
down
khalid
hussein
and
the
professor
talked
about
it
a
month
before
it
happened
i
have
seen
empires
rise
and
stretch
from
star
to
star
across
the
galaxy
and
crumble
and
fall
i
have
seen
doctor
hauserman
had
gotten
his
pen
out
of
his
pocket
and
was
signing
the
commitment
form
with
one
hand
with
the
other
he
pressed
a
button
on
the
desk
a
door
at
the
rear
opened
and
a
large
young
man
in
a
white
jacket
entered
you
have
to
go
away
for
a
while
professor
hauserman
was
telling
him
much
later
after
he
had
allowed
himself
to
become
calm
again
for
how
long
i
do
know
maybe
a
year
or
so
you
mean
to
northern
state
mental
well
yes
professor
you
had
a
bad
i
do
suppose
you
realize
how
bad
you
been
working
too
hard
harder
than
your
nervous
system
could
stand
it
been
too
much
for
you
you
mean
i
nuts
please
professor
i
deplore
that
sort
of
terminology
you
had
a
severe
psychological
breakdown
will
i
be
able
to
have
books
and
papers
and
work
a
little
i
could
bear
the
prospect
of
complete
idleness
that
would
be
all
right
if
you
did
work
too
hard
and
could
i
say
to
some
of
my
friends
hauserman
nodded
and
asked
who
well
professor
pottgeiter
he
outside
now
he
was
inquiring
about
you
and
stanly
weill
my
attorney
not
business
just
to
say
oh
i
sorry
professor
he
not
in
town
now
he
left
almost
immediately
after
after
after
he
found
out
i
was
crazy
for
sure
where
he
go
to
reno
he
took
the
plane
at
five
weill
would
have
believed
anyhow
no
use
trying
to
blame
himself
for
that
but
he
was
as
sure
that
he
would
never
see
stanly
weill
alive
again
as
he
was
that
the
next
morning
the
sun
would
rise
he
nodded
impassively
sorry
he
could
stay
can
i
see
max
pottgeiter
alone
yes
of
course
professor
old
pottgeiter
came
in
his
face
anguished
ed
it
is
true
he
stammered
i
wo
believe
that
it
true
what
max
that
you
crazy
nobody
can
make
me
believe
that
he
put
his
hand
on
the
old
man
shoulder
confidentially
max
neither
do
i
but
do
tell
anybody
i
not
it
a
secret
pottgeiter
looked
troubled
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
wondering
if
he
might
be
wrong
and
hauserman
and
whitburn
and
the
others
right
max
do
you
believe
in
me
he
asked
do
you
believe
that
i
knew
about
khalid
assassination
a
month
before
it
happened
it
a
horribly
hard
thing
to
believe
pottgeiter
admitted
but
dammit
ed
you
did
i
know
medieval
history
is
full
of
stories
about
prophecies
being
fulfilled
i
always
thought
those
stories
were
just
legends
that
grew
up
after
the
event
and
of
course
he
about
a
century
late
for
me
but
there
was
nostradamus
maybe
those
old
prophecies
were
just
post
legends
after
all
yes
after
khalid
i
believe
that
all
right
i
saying
now
that
in
a
few
days
there
be
a
bad
explosion
at
reno
nevada
watch
the
papers
and
the
telecast
for
it
if
it
happens
that
ought
to
prove
it
and
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
turks
annexing
syria
and
lebanon
the
old
man
nodded
when
that
happens
get
away
from
blanley
come
up
to
the
town
where
northern
state
mental
hospital
is
and
get
yourself
a
place
to
live
and
stay
there
and
try
to
bring
marjorie
fenner
along
with
you
will
you
do
that
max
if
you
say
so
his
eyes
widened
something
bad
going
to
happen
here
yes
max
something
very
bad
you
promise
me
you
will
of
course
ed
you
know

only
friend

have
around

the
key
to
my
apartment
he
got
it
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
pottgeiter
with
instructions
everything
in
the
filing
cabinet
on
the
left
of
my
desk
and
do
let
anybody
else
see
any
of
it
keep
it
safe
for
me
the
large
young
man
in
the
white
coat
entered
the
end
