the
natural
history
of
selborne
in
a
series
of
letters
addressed
to
thomas
pennant
esq
and
the
hon
daines
barrington
advertisement
the
author
of
the
following
letters
takes
the
liberty
with
all
proper
deference
of
laying
before
the
public
his
idea
of
parochial
history
which
he
thinks
ought
to
consist
of
natural
productions
and
occurrences
as
well
as
antiquities
he
is
also
of
opinion
that
if
stationary
men
would
pay
some
attention
to
the
districts
on
which
they
reside
and
would
publish
their
thoughts
respecting
the
objects
that
surround
them
from
such
materials
might
be
drawn
the
most
complete
which
are
still
wanting
in
several
parts
of
this
kingdom
and
in
particular
in
the
county
of
southampton
and
here
he
seizes
the
first
opportunity
though
a
late
one
of
returning
his
most
grateful
acknowledgments
to
the
reverend
the
president
and
the
reverend
and
worthy
the
fellows
of
magdalen
college
in
the
university
of
oxford
for
their
liberal
behaviour
in
permitting
their
archives
to
be
searched
by
a
member
of
their
own
society
so
far
as
the
evidences
therein
contained
might
respect
the
parish
and
priory
of
selborne
to
that
gentleman
also
and
his
assistant
whose
labours
and
attention
could
only
be
equalled
by
the
very
kind
manner
in
which
they
were
bestowed
many
and
great
obligations
are
also
due
of
the
authenticity
of
the
documents
there
can
be
no
doubt
since
they
consist
of
the
identical
deeds
and
records
that
were
removed
to
the
college
from
the
priory
at
the
time
of
its
dissolution
and
being
carefully
copied
on
the
spot
may
be
depended
on
as
genuine
and
never
having
been
made
public
before
may
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
antiquary
as
well
as
establish
the
credit
of
the
history
if
the
writer
should
at
all
appear
to
have
induced
any
of
his
readers
to
pay
a
more
ready
attention
to
the
wonders
of
the
creation
too
frequently
overlooked
as
common
occurrences
or
if
he
should
by
any
means
through
his
researches
have
lent
an
helping
hand
towards
the
enlargement
of
the
boundaries
of
historical
and
topographical
knowledge
or
if
he
should
have
thrown
some
small
light
upon
ancient
customs
and
manners
and
especially
on
those
that
were
monastic
his
purpose
will
be
fully
answered
but
if
he
should
not
have
been
successful
in
any
of
these
his
intentions
yet
there
remains
this
consolation
behind
that
these
his
pursuits
by
keeping
the
body
and
mind
employed
have
under
providence
contributed
to
much
health
and
cheerfulness
of
spirits
even
to
old
age
and
what
still
adds
to
his
happiness
have
led
him
to
the
knowledge
of
a
circle
of
gentlemen
whose
intelligent
communications
as
they
have
afforded
him
much
pleasing
information
so
could
he
flatter
himself
with
a
continuation
of
them
would
they
ever
be
deemed
a
matter
of
singular
satisfaction
and
improvement

to

to

stood
within

twenty
years
a

folio
latissimo
scabro
of

which
though
it
had
lost
a

in

equal
to
a
moderate
tree
yet
when
felled
contained
eight
loads
of

and
being
too
bulky
for
a
carriage
was
sawn
off
at
seven
feet
above
the

it
measured
near
eight
feet
in
the

this

i
mention
to
show
to
what
a
bulk
planted
elms
may
attain
as
this
tree
must
certainly
have
been
such
from
its
situation
in
the
centre
of
the
village
and
near
the
church
is
a
square
piece
of
ground
surrounded
by
houses
and
vulgarly
called
the
plestor
in
the
midst
of
this
spot
stood
in
old
times
a
vast
oak
with
a
short
squat
body
and
huge
horizontal
arms
extending
almost
to
the
extremity
of
the
area
this
venerable
tree
surrounded
with
stone
steps
and
seats
above
them
was
the
delight
of
old
and
young

bestowed

in

it
in

could
not

certainly
have

will
appear
from
what
will
be
said
farther
concerning
this
area
when
we
enter
on
the
antiquities
of
selborne
on
the
blackmoor
estate
there
is
a
small
wood
called
losel
of
a
few
acres
that
was
lately
furnished
with
a
set
of
oaks
of
a
peculiar
growth
and
great
value
they
were
tall
and
taper
like
firs
but
standing
near
together
had
very
small
heads
only
a
little
brush
without
any
large
limbs
about
twenty
years
ago
the
bridge
at
the
toy
near
being
much
decayed
some
trees
were
wanted
for
the
repairs
that
were
fifty
feet
long
without
bough
and
would
measure
twelve
inches
diameter
at
the
little
end
twenty
such
trees
did
a
purveyor
find
in
this
little
wood
with
this
advantage
that
many
of
them
answered
the
description
at
sixty
feet
these
trees
were
sold
for
twenty
pounds
apiece
in
the
centre
of
this
grove
there
stood
an
oak
which
though
shapely
and
tall
on
the
whole
bulged
out
into
a
large
excrescence
about
the
middle
of
the
stem
on
this
a
pair
of
ravens
had
fixed
their
residence
for
such
a
series
of
years
that
the
oak
was
distinguished
by
the
title
of
the
many
were
the
attempts
of
the
neighbouring
youths
to
get
at
this
eyry
the
difficulty
whetted
their
inclinations
and
each
was
ambitious
of
surmounting
the
arduous
task
but
when
they
arrived
at
the
swelling
it
jutted
out
so
in
their
way
and
was
so
far
beyond
their
grasp
that
the
most
daring
lads
were
awed
and
acknowledged
the
undertaking
to
be
too
hazardous
so
the
ravens
built
on
nest
upon
nest
in
perfect
security
till
the
fatal
day
arrived
in
which
the
wood
was
to
be
levelled
it
was
in
the
month
of
february
when
those
birds
usually
sit
the
saw
was
applied
to
the
butt
the
wedges
were
inserted
into
the
opening
the
woods
echoed
to
the
heavy
blows
of
the
beetle
or
mallet
the
tree
nodded
to
its
fall
but
still
the
dam
sat
on
at
last
when
it
gave
way
the
bird
was
flung
from
her
nest
and
though
her
parental
affection
deserved
a
better
fate
was
whipped
down
by
the
twigs
which
brought
her
dead
to
the
ground

esquire
the
of
this
district
and
sorts
of
stone
such
as
have
fallen
within
my
observation
must
not
be
passed
over
in
silence
and
first
i
must
mention
as
a
great
curiosity
a
specimen
that
was
ploughed
up
in
the
chalky
fields
near
the
side
of
the
down
and
given
to
me
for
the
singularity
of
its
appearance
which
to
an
incurious
eye
seems
like
a
petrified
fish
of
about
four
inches
long
the
cardo
passing
for
an
head
and

it
is
in
reality
a

and
by
those
who
make

though
i
applied
to
several
such
in
london
i
could
never
meet
with
an
entire
specimen
nor
could
i
ever
find
in
books
any
engraving
from
a
perfect
one
in
the
superb
museum
at
permission
was
given
me
to
examine
for
this
article
and
though
i
was
disappointed
as
to
the
fossil
i
was
highly
gratified
with
the
sight
of
several
of
the
shells
themselves
in
high
preservation
this
bivalve
is
only
known
to
inhabit
the
indian
ocean
where
it
fixes
itself
to
a
zoophyte
known
by
the
name
gorgonia
the
curious
foldings
of
the
suture
the
one
into
the
other
the
alternate
flutings
or
grooves
and
the
curved
form
of
my
specimen
being
much
easier
expressed
by
the
pencil
than
by
words
i
have
caused
it
to
be
drawn
and
engraved
cornua
ammonis
are
very
common
about
this
village
as
we
were
cutting
an
inclining
path
up
the
hanger
the
labourers
found
them
frequently
on
that
steep
just
under
the
soil
in
the
chalk
and
of
a
considerable
size
in
the
lane
above
in
the
way
to
emshot
they
abound
in
the
bank
in
a
darkish
sort
of
marl
and
are
usually
very
small
and
soft
but
in
clay
pond
a
little
farther
on
at
the
end
of
the
pit
where
the
soil
is
dug
out
for
manure
i
have
occasionally
observed
them
of
large
dimensions
perhaps
fourteen
or
sixteen
inches
in
diameter
but
as
these
did
not
consist
of
firm
stone
but
were
formed
of
a
kind
of
terra
lapidosa
or
hardened
clay
as
soon
as
they
were
exposed
to
the
rains
and
frost
they
mouldered
away
these
seemed
as
if
they
were
a
very
recent
production
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
hanger
large
nautili
are
sometimes
observed
in
the
very
thickest
strata
of
our
freestone
and
at
considerable
depths
often
find
large
scallops
or
pectines
having
both
shells
deeply
striated
and
ridged
and
furrowed
alternately
they
are
highly
impregnated
with
if
not
wholly

of
the

letter
iv
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
as
in
a
former
letter
the
freestone
of
this
place
has
been
only
mentioned
incidentally
i
shall
here
become
more
particular
this
stone
is
in
great
request
for
and
the
beds
of
ovens
and
in
lining
of
it
turns
to
good
account
for
the
workmen
use
sandy
loam
instead
of
mortar
the
sand
of
which
and
runs
by
the
intense
heat
and
so
cases
over
the
whole
face
of
the
kiln
with
a
strong
vitrified
coat
like
glass
that
it
is
well
preserved
from
injuries
of
weather
and
endures
thirty
or
forty
years
when
chiseled
smooth
it
makes
elegant
fronts
for
houses
equal
in
colour
and
grain
to
the
bath
stone
and
superior
in
one
respect
that
when
seasoned
it
does
not
scale
decent
pieces
are
worked
from
it
of
much
closer
and
finer
grain
than
portland
and
rooms
are
floored
with
it
but
it
proves
rather
too
soft
for
this
purpose
it
is
a
freestone
cutting
in
all
directions
yet
has
something
of
a
grain
parallel
with
the
horizon
and
therefore
should
not
be
surbedded
but
laid
in
the
same
position
as
it
grows
in
the
quarry
on
the
ground
abroad
this
firestone
will
not
succeed
for
pavements
because
probably
some
degree
of
saltness
prevailing
within
it
the
rain
tears
the
slabs
to
pieces
though
this
stone
is
too
hard
to
be
acted
on
by
vinegar
yet
both
the
white
part
and
even
the
blue
rag
ferments
strongly
in
mineral
acids
though
the
white
stone
will
not
bear
wet
yet
in
every
quarry
at
intervals
there
are
thin
strata
of
blue
rag
which
resist
rain
and
frost
and
are
excellent
for
pitching
of
stables
paths
and
courts
and
for
building
of
dry
walls
against
banks
a
valuable
species
of
fencing
much
in
use
in
this
village
and
for
mending
of
roads
this
rag
is
rugged
and
stubborn
and
will
not
hew
to
a
smooth
face
but
is
very
durable
yet
as
these
strata
are
shallow
and
lie
deep
large
quantities
can
not
be
procured
but
at
considerable
expense
among
the
blue
rags
turn
up
some
blocks
tinged
with
a
stain
of
yellow
or
rust
colour
which
seem
to
be
nearly
as
lasting
as
the
blue
and
every
now
and
then

of
a
friable
substance
like
rust

called

so
pure

to
set
it
edgewise
contrary
to
the
posture
it
had
in

does
not
succeed
in

do

embellishment
carries
an
odd
appearance

has
occasioned

to
ask
us
pleasantly

the

our
attention
these
roads
running
through

are
by
the

of
ages
and
the
fretting
of

worn
down
through
the
first
stratum
of
our
freestone
and
partly
through
the
second
so
that
they
look
more
like

than

and
are
bedded
with

for
furlongs
together
in
many
places
they
are
reduced
sixteen

eighteen

beneath

very
grotesque

from
the
tangled

that
are
twisted
among

letter

to

esquire
should
i
omit
to
describe
with
some
exactness
the
forest
of
wolmer
of
which
perhaps
lie
in
this
parish
my
account
of
selborne
would
be
very
imperfect
as
it
is
a
district
abounding
with
many
curious
productions
both
animal
and
vegetable
and
has
often
afforded
me
much
entertainment
both
as
a
sportsman
and
as
a
naturalist
the
royal
forest
of
wolmer
is
a
tract
of
land
of
about
seven
miles
in
length
by
two
and
a
half
in
breadth
running
nearly
from
north
to
south
and
is
abutted
on
to
begin
to
the
south
and
so
to
proceed
eastward
by
the
parishes
of
greatham
lysse
rogate
and
trotton
in
the
county
of
sussex
by
bramshot
hedleigh
and
kingsley
this
royalty
consists
entirely
of
sand
covered
with
heath
and
fern
but
is
somewhat
diversified
with
hills
and
dales
without
having
one
standing
tree
in
the
whole
extent
in
the
bottoms
where
the
waters
stagnate
are
many
bogs
which
formerly
abounded
with
subterraneous
trees
though
dr
plot
says
positively
that
never
were
any
fallen
trees
hidden
in
the
mosses
of
the
southern
counties
but
he
was
mistaken
for
i
myself
have
seen
cottages
on
the
verge
of
this
wild
district
whose
timbers
consisted
of
a
black
hard
wood
looking
like
oak
which
the
owners
assured
me
they
procured
from
the
bogs
by
probing
the
soil
with
spits
or
some
such
instruments
but
the
peat
is
so
much
cut
out
and
the
moors
have
been
so
well
examined
that
none
has
been
found
of
late
besides
the
oak
i
have
also
been
shown
pieces
of
of
a
paler
colour
and
softer
nature
which
the
inhabitants
called
fir
but
upon
a
nice
examination
and
trial
by
fire
i
could
discover
nothing
resinous
in
them
and
therefore
rather
suppose
that
they
were
parts
of
a
willow
or
alder
or
some
such
aquatic
tree
see
his
hist
of
staffordshire
old
people
have
assured
me
that
on
a
winter
morning
they
have
discovered
these
trees
in
the
bogs
by
the
hoar
frost
which
lay
longer
over
the
space
where
they
were
concealed
than
on
the
surrounding
morass
nor
does
this
seem
to
be
a
fanciful
notion
but
consistent
with
true
philosophy
hales
saith
the
warmth
of
the
earth
at
some
depth
under
ground
has
an
influence
in
promoting
a
thaw
as
well
as
the
change
of
the
weather
from
a
freezing
to
a
thawing
state
is
manifest
from
this
observation
viz
a
little
snow
having
fallen
in
the
night
it
was
by
eleven
the
next
morning
mostly
melted
away
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
except
in
several
places
in
bushy
park
where
there
were
drains
dug
and
covered
with
earth
on
which
the
snow
continued
to
lie
whether
those
drains
were
full
of
water
or
dry
as
also
where
lay
under
ground
a
plain
proof
this
that
those
drains
intercepted
the
warmth
of
the
earth
from
ascending
from
greater
depths
below
them
for
the
snow
lay
where
the
drain
had
more
than
four
feet
depth
of
earth
over
it
it
continued
also
to
lie
on
thatch
tiles
and
the
tops
of

might
not
such
observations
be
reduced

domestic
use

the

obliterated

the
finding
of
pavements

and
graves
and
other
hidden
relics
of
curious
antiquity
this
lonely
domain
is
a
very
agreeable
haunt
for
many
sorts
of
wild
fowls
which
not
only
frequent
it
in
the
winter
but
breed
there
in
the
summer
such
as
lapwings
snipes
and
as
i
have
discovered
within
these
few
years
teals
partridges
in
vast
plenty
are
bred
in
good
seasons
on
the
verge
of
this
forest
into
which
they
love
to
make
excursions
and
in
particular
in
the
dry
summer
of
and
and
some
years
after
they
swarmed
to
such
a
degree
that
parties
of
unreasonable
sportsmen
killed
twenty
and
sometimes
thirty
brace
in
a
day
but
there
was
a
nobler
species
of
game
in
this
forest
now
extinct
which
i
have
heard
old
people
say
abounded
much
before
shooting
flying
became
so
common
and
that
was
the
game
or
grouse
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
recollect
one
coming
now
and
then
to
my
father
table
the
last
pack
remembered
was
killed
about
years
ago
and
within
these
ten
years
one
solitary
greyhen
was
sprung
by
some
beagles
in
beating
for
a
hare
the
sportsmen
cried
out
hen
pheasant
but
a
gentleman
present
who
had
often
seen
grouse
in
the
north
of
england
assured
me
that
it
was
a
greyhen
nor
does
the
loss
of
our
black
game
prove
the
only
gap
in
the
fauna
selborniensis
for
another
beautiful
link
in
the
chain
of
beings
is
wanting
i
mean
the
red
deer
which
toward
the
beginning
of
this
century
amounted
to
about
five
hundred
head
and
made
a
stately
appearance
there
is
an
old
keeper
now
alive
named
adams
whose
mentioned
in
a
perambulation
taken
in
grandfather
father
and
self
enjoyed
the

keepership
of
in
succession
for
more
than
an

years
this
person
assures
me
that
his
father
has
often
told
him
that
queen
anne
as
she
was
journeying
on
the
portsmouth
road
did
not
think
the
forest
of
wolmer
beneath
her
royal
regard
for
she
came
out
of
the
great
road
at
lippock
which
is
just
by
and
reposing
herself
on
a
bank
smoothed
for
that
purpose
lying
about
half
a
mile
to
the
east
of
and
still
called
saw
with
great
complacency
and
satisfaction
the
whole
herd
of
red
deer
brought
by
the
keepers
along
the
vale
before
her
consisting
then
of
about
five
hundred
head
a
sight
this
worthy
the
attention
of
the
greatest
sovereign
but
he
further
adds
that
by
means
of
the
waltham
blacks
or
to
use
his
own
expression
as
soon
as
they
began
blacking
they
were
reduced
to
about
fifty
head
and
so
continued
decreasing
till
the
time
of
the
late
duke
of
cumberland
it
is
now
more
than
thirty
years
ago
that
his
highness
sent
down
an
huntsman
and
six
in
scarlet
jackets
laced
with
gold
attended
by
the
ordering
them
to
take
every
deer
in
this
forest
alive
and
convey
them
in
carts
to
windsor
in
the
course
of
the
summer
they
caught
every
stag
some
of
which
showed
extraordinary
diversion
but
in
the
following
winter
when
the
hinds
were
also
carried
off
such
fine
chases
were
exhibited
as
served
the
country
people
for
matter
of
talk
and
wonder
for
years
afterwards
i
saw
myself
one
of
the
single
out
a
stag
from
the
herd
and
must
confess
that
it
was
the
most
curious
feat
of
activity
i
ever
beheld
superior
to
anything
in
astley
the
exertions
made
by
the
horse
and
deer
much
exceeded
all
my
expectations
though
the
former
greatly
excelled
the
latter
in
speed
when
the
devoted
deer
was
separated
from
his
companions
they
gave
him
by
their
watches
law
as
they
called
it
for
twenty
minutes
when
sounding
their
horns
the
were
permitted
to
pursue
and
a
most
gallant
scene
ensued
letter

to
thomas
pennant
esquire
though
large
herds
of
deer
do
much
harm
to
the
neighbourhood
yet
the
injury
to
the
morals
of
the
people
is
of
more
moment
than
the
loss
of
their
crops
the
temptation
is
irresistible
for
most
men
are
sportsmen
by
constitution
and
there
is
such
an
inherent
spirit
for
hunting
in
human
nature
as
scarce
any
inhibitions
can
restrain
hence
towards
the
beginning
of
this
century
all
this
country
was
wild
about
unless
he
was
a
hunter
as
they
affected
to
call
themselves
no
young
person
was
allowed
to
be
possessed
of
manhood
or
gallantry
the
waltham
blacks
at
length
committed
such
enormities
that
government
was
forced
to
interfere
with
that
severe
and
sanguinary
act
called
the
black
act
which
now
comprehends
more
felonies
than
any
law
that
ever
was
framed
before
and
therefore
a
late
bishop
of
winchester
when
urged
to
refused
from
a
motive
worthy
of
a
prelate
replying
that
had
done
mischief
enough

our
old
race
of
are
hardly
extinct
yet
it
was
but
a
little
while
ago
that
over
their
ale
they
used
to
recount
the
exploits
of
their
youth
such
as
watching
the
pregnant
hind
to
her
lair
and
when
the
calf
was
dropped
paring
its
feet
with
a
penknife
to
the
quick
to
prevent
its
escape
till
it
was
large
and
fat
enough
to
be
killed
the
shooting
at
one
of
their
neighbours
with
a
bullet
in
a

moonshine
mistaking
him
for
a

and

losing

dog
in
the
following
extraordinary
manner
some
fellows
suspecting
that
a
calf
was
deposited
in
a
certain
spot
of
thick
fern
went
with
a
lurcher
to
surprise
it
when
the
parent
hind
rushed
out
of
the
brake
and
taking
a
vast
spring
with
all
her
feet
close
together
pitched
upon
the
neck
of
the
dog
and
broke
it
short
in
two
another
temptation
to
idleness
and
sporting
was
a
number
of
rabbits
which
possessed
all
the
hillocks
and
dry
places
but
these
being
inconvenient
to
the
huntsmen
on
account
of
their
burrows
when
they
came
to
take
away
the
deer
they
permitted
the
country
people
to
destroy
them
all
such
forests
and
wastes
when
their
allurements
to
irregularities
are
removed
are
of
considerable
service
to

that
verge
upon
them
by
furnishing
them
with
peat
and
turf
for
their
firing
with
fuel
for
the
burning
their
lime
and
with
ashes
for
their
grasses
and
by
maintaining
their
geese
and
their
stock
of
young
cattle
at
little
or
no
expense
the
manor
farm
of
the
parish
of
greatham
has
an
admitted
claim
i
see
by
an
old
record
taken
from
the
tower
of
london
of
turning
all
live
stock
on
the
forest
at
proper
seasons
bidentibus
exceptis
the
reason
i
presume
why
are
excluded
is
because
being
such
close
grazers
they
would
pick
out
all
the
finest
grasses
and
hinder
the
deer
from
thriving
for
the
privilege
the
owner
of
that
estate
used
to
pay
to
the
king
annually
seven
bushels
of
oats
in
the
holt
where
a
full
stock
of
has
been
kept
up
till
lately
no
sheep
are
admitted

yet
in
this

about
march

according
to
the
dryness
of
the

such
vast
are
lighted
up
that
they
often
get
to
a
masterless
head
and
catching
the
hedges
have
sometimes
been
communicated
to
the
underwoods
woods
and
coppices
where
great
damage
has
ensued
the
plea
for
these
burnings
is
that
when
the
old
coat
of
heath
is
consumed
young
will
sprout
up
and
afford
much
tender
browse
for
cattle
but
where
there
is
large
old
furze
the
fire
following
the
roots
consumes
the
very
ground
so
that
for
hundreds
of
acres
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
smother
and
desolation
the
whole
circuit
round
looking
like
the
cinders
of

volcano
and
the
soil
being
quite
exhausted
no

are
to
be
found
for
years
these
conflagrations
as
they
take
place
usually
with
a
or
east
wind
much
annoy
this
village
with
their
smoke
and
often
alarm
the
country
and
once
in
particular
i
remember
that
a
gentleman
who
lives
beyond

coming
to
my
house
when
he
got
on
the
downs
between
that
town
and
winchester
at
miles
distance
was
surprised
much
with
smoke
and
a
hot
smell
of
fire
and
concluded
that
alresford
was
in
flames
but
when
he
came
to
that
town
he
then
had
apprehensions
for
the
next
village
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
his
journey
on

of
the
most
conspicuous
eminences

wolmer
and
holt
were
measured
by
persons
set
down
by
government
by
a
perambulation
of
and
the
holt
made
in
and
in
the
eleventh
year
of
charles
the
first
which
now
lies
before
me
it
appears
that
the
limits
of
the
former
are
much
circumscribed
for
to
say
nothing
on
the
farther
side
with
which
i
am
not
so
well
acquainted
the
bounds
on
this
side
in
old
times
came
into
binswood
and
extended
to
the
ditch
of
ward
le
ham
park
in
which
stands
the
curious
mount
called
king
john
hill
and
lodge
hill
and
to
the
verge
of
hartley
mauduit
called
comprehending
also
oakhanger
and
oakwoods
a
large
district
now
private
property
though
once
belonging
to
the
royal
domain
it
is
remarkable
that
the
term
purlieu
is
never
once
mentioned
in
this
long
roll
of
parchment
it
contains
besides
the
perambulation
a
rough
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
timbers
which
were
considerable
growing
at
that
time
in
the
district
of
the
halt
and
enumerates
the
officers
superior
and
inferior
of
those
joint
forests
for
the
time
being
and
their
ostensible
fees
and
perquisites
in
those
days
as
at
present
there
were
hardly
any
trees
in
forest
within
the
present
limits
of
the
forest
are
three
considerable
lakes
hogmer
cranmer
and
wolmer
all
of
which
are
stocked
with
carp
tench
eels
and
perch
but
the
fish
do
not
thrive
well
because
the
water
is
hungry
and
the
bottoms
are
a
naked
sand
a
circumstance
respecting
these
ponds
though
by
no
means
peculiar
to
them
i
can
not
pass
over
in
silence
and
that
is
that
instinct
by
which
in
summer
all
the
kine
whether
oxen
cows
calves
or
heifers
retire
constantly
to
the
water
during
the
hotter
hours
where
being
more
exempt
from
flies
and
inhaling
the
coolness
of
that
element
some
belly
deep
and
some
only
to
leg
they
ruminate
and
solace
themselves
from
about
ten
in
the
morning
till
four
in
the
afternoon
and
then
return
to
their
feeding
during
this
great
proportion
of
the
day
they
drop
much
dung
in
which
insects
nestle
and
so
supply
food
for
the
fish
which
would
be
poorly
subsisted
but
from
this
contingency
thus
nature
who
is
a
great
economist
converts
the
recreation
of
one
animal
to
the
support
of
another
thomson
who
was
a
nice
observer
of
natural
occurrences
did
not
let
this
pleasing
circumstance
escape
him
he
says
in
his
summer
a
various
group
the
herds
and
flocks
compose
on
the
grassy
bank
some
ruminating
lie
while
others
stand
half
in
the
flood
and
often
bending
sip
the
circling
surface
so
called
i
suppose
for
eminence
sake
is
a
vast
lake
for
this
part
of
the
world
containing
in
its
whole
circumference
yards
or
very
near
a
mile
and
a
half
the
length
of
the
and
opposite
side
is
about
yards
and
the
breadth
of
the
end
about
yards
this
measurement
which
i
caused
to
be
made
with
good
exactness
gives
an
area
of
about
acres
exclusive
of
a
large
irregular
arm
at
the
corner
which
we
did
not
take
into
the
reckoning
on
the
face
of
this
expanse
of
waters
and
perfectly
secure
from
fowlers
lie
all
day
long
in
the
winter
season
vast
flocks
of
ducks
teals
and
widgeons
of
various
denominations
where
they
preen
and
solace
and
rest
themselves
till
towards
sunset
when
they
issue
forth
in
little
parties
for
in
their
natural
state
they
are
all
birds
of
the
night
to
feed
in
the
brooks
and
meadows
returning
again
with
the
dawn
of
the
morning
had
this
lake
an
arm
or
two
more
and
were
it
planted
round
with
thick
covert
for
now
it
is
perfectly
naked
it
might
make
a
valuable
decoy
yet
neither
its
extent
nor
the
clearness
of
its
water
nor
the
resort
of
various
and
curious
fowls
nor
its
picturesque
groups
of
cattle
can
render
this
meer
so
remarkable
as
the
great
quantity
of
coins
that
were
found
in
its
bed
about
forty
years
ago
but
as
such
discoveries
more
properly
belong
to
the
antiquities

suppress
all
particulars

is

that
though
the

been
my
misfortune
never

have

neighbours
whose

have
led
them
towards
the
pursuit
of
natural
knowledge
so
that
for
want
of
a
companion
to
quicken
my
industry
and
sharpen
my
attention
i
have
made
but
slender
progress
in
a
kind
of
information
to
which
i
have
been
attached
from
my
childhood
as
to
swallows
hirundines
rusticae
being
found
in
a
torpid
state
during
the
winter
in
the
isle
of
wight
or
any
part
of
this
country
i
never
heard
any
such
account
worth
attending
to
but
a
clergyman
of
an
inquisitive
turn
assures
me
that
when
he
was
a
great
boy
some
workmen
in
pulling
down
the
battlements
of
a
church
tower
early
in
the
spring
found
two
or
three
swifts
hirundines
apodes
among
the
rubbish
which
were
at
first
appearance
dead
but
on
being
carried
toward
the
fire
revived
he
told
me
that
out
of
his
great
care
to
preserve
them
he
put
them
in
a
paper
bag
and
hung
them
by
the
kitchen
fire
where
they
were
suffocated
another
intelligent
person
has
informed
me
that
while
he
was
a
schoolboy
at
brighthelmstone
in
sussex
a
great
fragment
of
the
chalk
cliff
fell
down
one
stormy
winter
on
the
beach
and
that
many
people
found
swallows
among
the
rubbish
but
on
my
questioning
him
whether
he
saw
any
of
those
birds
himself
to
my
no
small
disappointment
he
answered
me
in
the
negative
but
that
others
assured
him
they
did
young
broods
of
swallows
began
to
appear
this
year
on
july
the
eleventh
and
young
martins
hirundines
urbicae
were
then
fledged
in
their
nests
both
species
will
breed
again
once
for
i
see
by
my
fauna
of
last
year
that
young
broods
come
forth
so
late
as
september
the
eighteenth
are
not
these
late
hatchings
more
in
favour
of
hiding
than
migration
nay
some
young
martins
remained
in
their
nests
last
year
so
late
as
september
the
ninth
and
yet
they
totally
disappeared
with
us
by
the
fifth
of
october
how
strange
is
it
that
the
swift
which
seems
to
live
exactly
the
same
life
with
the
swallow
and
should
leave
us
before
the
middle
of
august
invariably
while
the
latter
stay
often
till
the
middle
of
october
and
once
i
saw
numbers
of
martins
on
the
seventh
of
november
the
martins
and
fieldfares
were
flying
in
sight
together
an
uncommon
assemblage
of
summer
and
winter
birds
a
little
bird
it
is
either
a
species
of
the
alauda
trivialis
or
rather
perhaps
of
the
motacilla
trochilus
still
continues
to
make
a
sibilous
shivering
noise
in
the
tops
of
tall
woods
the
stoparola
of
ray
for
which
we
have
as
yet
no
name
in
these
parts
is
called
in
your
zoology
the
there
is
one
circumstance
characteristic
of
this
bird
which
seems
to
have
escaped
observation
and
that
is
that
it
takes
its
stand
on
the
top
of
some
stake
or
post
from
whence
it
springs
forth
on
its
prey
catching
a
fly
in
the
air
and
hardly
ever
touching
the
ground
but
returning
still
to
the
same
stand
for
many
times
together
i
perceive
there
are
more
than
one
species
of
the
motacilla
trochilus
derham
supposes
in
ray
philos
letters
that
he
has
discovered
three
in
these
there
is
again
an
instance
of
some
very
common
birds
that
have
as
yet
no
english
name
stillingfleet
makes
a
question
whether
the
motacilla
atricapilla
be
a
bird
of
passage
or
not
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
for
in
april
in
the
very
first
fine
weather
they
come
trooping
all
at
once
into
these
parts
but
are
never
seen
in
the
winter
they
are
delicate
songsters
numbers
of
snipes
breed
every
summer
in
some
moory
ground
on
the
verge
of
this
parish
it
is
very
amusing
to
see
the
cock
bird
on
wing
at
that
time
and
to
hear
his
piping
and
humming
notes
i
have
had
no
opportunity
yet
of
procuring
any
of
those
mice
which
i
mentioned
to
you
in

the
person
that
brought
me
the
last
says
they
are
plenty
in
harvest
at
which
time
i
will
take
care
to
get
more
and
will
endeavour
to
put
the
matter
out
of
doubt
whether
it
be
a
nondescript
species
or
not
i
suspect
much
there
may
be
two
species
of
ray
says
and
linnaeus
after
him
that
the
is
behind
now
i
have
discovered
a
rat
on
the
banks
of
our
little
stream
that
is
not
and
yet
is
an
excellent
swimmer
and
diver
it
answers
exactly
to
the
mus
amphibius
of
linnaeus
see
syst
nat
which
he
says
in

i
should
be
glad
to
procure
one
palmatis
linnaeus
seems
to
be
in
a
puzzle
about
his
mus
amphibius
and
to
doubt
whether
it
differs
from
his
mus
terrestris
which
if
it
be
as
he
allows
the

is
widely
different
from

both

i
mentioned
in

i
shall
take
the
liberty
to
send
it
down
to
you

on
your
candour

you

excuse

eight

in

weather
frequent
our
lakes
in

having
some
acquaintance
with
a
tame

owl
i
find
that
it
casts
up
the
fur
of
mice
and
the
feathers
of
birds
in
pellets
after
the
manner
of
hawks
when
full
like
a

it
hides

it
can
not
eat
the
young
of
the
are
not
easily
raised
as
they
want
a
constant
supply
of
fresh
mice
whereas
the
young
of
the
brown
owl
will
eat
indiscriminately
all
that
is
brought

any
kind

i
observed
was
about
the
of

i
have

no

i
forgot
to
mention
that
i
once
saw
in
christ
church
college
quadrangle
in
oxford
on
a
very
sunny
warm
morning
a
martin
flying
about
and
settling
on
the
parapet
so
late
as
the
twentieth
of
november
at
present
i
know
only
two
species
of
bats
the
common
vespertilio
murinus
and
the
vespertilio
auritus
i
was
much
entertained
last
summer
with
a
tame
bat
which
would
take
flies
out
of
a
person
hand
if
you
gave
it
anything
to
eat
it
brought
its
wings
round
before
the
mouth
hovering
and
hiding
its
head
in
the
manner
of
birds
of
prey
when
they
feed
the
adroitness
it
showed
in
shearing
off
the
wings
of
the
flies
which
were
always
rejected
was
worthy
of
observation
and
pleased
me
much
insects
seem
to
be
most
acceptable
though
it
did
not
refuse
raw
flesh
when
offered
so
that
the
notion
that
bats
go
down
chimneys
and
gnaw
men
bacon
seems
no
improbable
story
while
i
amused
myself
with
this
wonderful
quadruped
i
saw
it
several
times
confute
the
vulgar
opinion
that
bats
when
down
on
a
flat
surface
can
not
get
on
the
wing
again
by
rising
with
great
ease
from
the
floor
it
ran
i
observed
with
more
dispatch
than
i
was
aware
of
but
in
a
most
ridiculous
and
grotesque
manner
bats
drink
on
the
wing
like
swallows
by
sipping
the
surface
as
they
play
over
pools
and
streams
they
love
to
frequent
waters
not
only
for
the
sake
of
drinking
but
on
account
of
insects
which
are
found
over
them
in
the
greatest
plenty
as
i
was
going
some
years
ago
pretty
late
in
a
boat
from
richmond
to
sunbury
on
a
warm
summer
evening
i
think
i
saw
myriads
of
bats
between
the
two
places
the
air
swarmed
with
them
all
along
the
thames
so
that
hundreds
were
in

letter
xii
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
november
sir
it
gave
me
no
small
satisfaction
to
hear
that
the
turned
out
an
uncommon
one
i
must
confess
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
to
have
heard
that
i
had
sent
you
a
bird
that
you
had
never
seen
before
but
that
i
find
would
be
a
difficult
task
this
hawk
proved
to
be
the
falco
peregrinus
a
variety
i
have
procured
some
of
the
mice
mentioned
in
my
former
letters
a
young
one
and
a
female
with
young
both
of
which
i
have
preserved
in
brandy
from
the
colour
shape
size
and
manner
of
nesting
i
make
no
doubt
but
that
the
species
is
nondescript
they
are
much
smaller
and
more
slender
than
the
mus
domesticus
medius
of
ray
and
have
more
of
the
squirrel
or
dormouse
colour
their
belly
is
white
a
straight
line
along
their
sides
divides
the
shades
of
their
back
and
belly
they
never
enter
into
houses
are
carried
into
ricks
and
barns
with
the
sheaves
abound
in
harvest
and
build
their
nests
amidst
the
straws
of
the
corn
above
the
ground
and
sometimes
in
thistles
they
breed
as
many
as
eight
at
a
litter
in
a
little
round
nest
composed
of
the
blades
of
grass
or
wheat
one
of
these
nests
i
procured
this
autumn
most
artificially
platted
and
composed
of
the
blades
of
wheat
perfectly
round
and
about
the
size
of
a
with
the
aperture
so
ingeniously
closed
that
there
was
no
discovering
to
what
part
it
belonged
it
was
so
compact
and
well
filled
that
it
would
roll
across
the
table
without
being
discomposed
though
it
contained
eight
little
mice
that
were
naked
and
blind
as
this
nest
was
perfectly
full
how
could
the
dam
come
at
her
litter
respectively
so
as
to
administer
a
teat
to
each
perhaps
she
opens
different
places
for
that
purpose
adjusting
them
again
when
the
business
is
over
but
she
could
not
possibly
be
contained
herself
in
the
ball
with
her
young
which
moreover
would
be
daily
increasing
in
bulk
this
wonderful
procreant
cradle
an
elegant
instance
of
the
efforts
of
instinct

found
in

suspended
in

a
gentleman
curious
in
birds
wrote
me
word
that
his
servant
had
shot
one
last
january
in
that
severe
weather
which
he
believed
would
puzzle
me
i
called
to
see
it
this
summer
not
knowing
what
to
expect
but
the
moment
i
took
it
in
hand
i
pronounced
it
the
male
garrulus
bohemicus
or
german
from
the
five
peculiar
crimson
tags
or
points
which
it
carries
at
the
end
of
five
of
the
short
remiges
it
can
not
i
suppose
with
any
propriety
be
called
an
english
bird
and
yet
i
see
by
ray
philosoph
letters
that
great
flocks
of
them
feeding
upon
haws
appeared
in
this
kingdom
in
the
winter
of
the
mention
of
haws
put
me
in
mind
that
there
is
a
total
failure
of
that
wild
fruit
so
conducive
to
the
support
of
many
of
the
winged
nation
for
the
same
severe
weather
late
in
the
spring
which
cut
off
all
the
produce
of
the
more
tender
and
curious
trees
destroyed
also
that
of
the
more
hardy
and
common
some
birds
haunting
with
the
and
feeding
on
the
berries
of
the
which
answered
to
the
description
of
the
merula
torquata
or
were
lately
seen
in
this
neighbourhood
i
employed
some
people
to
procure
me
a
specimen
but
without
success
see

not
canary
birds
be
naturalized
to
this
climate
provided
their
eggs
were
put
in
the
spring
into
the
nests
of
some
of
their
congeners
as
goldfinches
greenfinches
etc
before
winter
perhaps
they
might
be
hardened
and
able
to
shift
for
themselves
about
ten
years
ago
i
used
to
spend
some
weeks
yearly
at
sunbury
which
is
one
of
those
pleasant
villages
lying
on
the
thames
near
in
the
autumn
i
could
not
help
being
much
amused
with
those
myriads
of
the
swallow
kind
which
assemble
in
those
parts
but
what
struck
me
most
was
that
from
the
time
they
began
to
congregate
forsaking
the
chimneys
and
houses
they
roosted
every
night
in
the
of
the
aits
of
that
river
now
this
resorting
towards
that
element
at
that
season
of
the
year
seems
to
give
some
countenance
to
the
northern
opinion
strange
as
it
is
of
their
retiring
under
water
a
swedish
naturalist
is
so
much
persuaded
of
that
fact
that
he
talks
in
his
calendar
of
flora
as
familiarly
of
the
swallows
going
under
water
in
the
beginning
of
september
as
he
would
of
his
poultry
going
to
roost
a
little
before
sunset
an
observing
gentleman
in
london
writes
me
word
that
he
saw
a
on
the
of
last
october
flying
in
and
out
of
its
nest
in
the
borough
and
i
myself
on
the
of
last
october
as
i
was
travelling
through
oxford
saw
four
or
five
swallows
hovering
round
and
settling
on
the
roof
of
the
hospital
now
is
it
likely
that
these
poor
little
birds
which
perhaps
had
not
been
hatched
but
a
few
weeks
should
at
that
late
season
of
the
year
and
from
so
midland
a
county
attempt
a
voyage
to
goree
or
senegal
almost
as
far
as
the
equator
see
adamson
voyage
to
senegal
i
acquiesce
entirely
in
your
opinion
that
though
most
of
the
swallow
kind
may
migrate
yet
that
some
do
stay
behind
and
hide
with
us
during
the
winter
as
to
the
birds
which
come
trooping
in
such
numbers
in
the
spring
i
am
at
a
loss
even
what
to
suspect
about
them
i
watched
them
narrowly
this
year
and
saw
them
abound
till
about
michaelmas
when
they
appeared
no
longer
subsist
they
can
not
openly
among
us
and
yet
elude
the
eyes
of
the
inquisitive
and
as
to
their
hiding
no
man
pretends
to
have
found
any
of
them
in
a
torpid
state
in
the
winter
but
with
regard
to
their
migration
what
difficulties
attend
that
supposition
that
such
feeble
bad
fliers
who
the
summer
long
never
flit
but
from
hedge
to
hedge
should
be
able
to
traverse
vast
seas
and
continents
in
order
to
enjoy
milder
seasons
amidst
the
regions
of
africa
letter
xiii
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
sir
as
in
one
of
your
former
letters
you
expressed
the
more
satisfaction
from
my
correspondence
on
account
of
my
living
in
the
most
southerly
county
so
now
i
may
return
the
compliment
and
expect
to
have
my
curiosity
gratified
by
your
living
much
more
to
the
north
for
many
years
past
i
have
observed
that
towards
christmas
vast
flocks
of
chaffinches
have
appeared
in
the
fields
many
more
i
used
to
think
than
could
be
hatched
in
any
one
neighbourhood
but
when
i
came
to
observe
them
more
narrowly
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
they
seemed
to
be
almost
all
hens
i
communicated
my
suspicions
to
some
intelligent
neighbours
who
after
taking
pains
about
the
matter
declared
that
they
also
thought
them
all
mostly
females
at
least
fifty
to
one
this
extraordinary
occurrence
brought
to
my
mind
the
remark
of
linnaeus
that
winter
all
their
hen
chaffinches
migrate
through
holland
into
italy
now
i
want
to
know
from
some
curious
person
in
the
north
whether
there
are
any
large
flocks
of
these
finches
with
them
in
the
winter
and
of
which
sex
they
mostly
consist
for
from
such
intelligence
one
might
be
able
to
judge
whether
our
female
flocks
migrate
from
the
other
end
of
the
island
or
whether
they
come
over
to
us
from
the
continent
we
have
in
the
winter
vast
flocks
of
the
common
linnets
more
i
think
than
can
be
bred
in
any
one
district
these
i
observe
when
the
spring
advances
assemble
on
some
tree
in
the
sunshine
and
join
all
in
a
gentle
sort
of
chirping
as
if
they
were
about
to
break
up
their
winter
quarters
and
betake
themselves
to
their
proper
summer
homes
it
is
well
known
at
least
that
the
swallows
and
the
fieldfares
do
congregate
with
a
gentle
twittering
before
they
make
their
respective
departure
you
may
depend
on
it
that
the
bunting
emberiza
miliaria
does
not
leave
this
country
in
the
winter
in
january
i
saw
several
dozen
of
them
in
the
midst
of
a
severe
frost
among
the
bushes
on
the
downs
near
andover
in
our
woodland
enclosed
district
it
is
a
rare
bird
wagtails
both
white
and
yellow
are
with
us
all
the
winter
quails
crowd
to
our
southern
coast
and
are
often
killed
in
numbers
by
people
that
go
on
purpose
stillingfleet
in
his
tracts
says
that
the
wheatear
oenanthe
does
not
quit
england
it
certainly
shifts
places
for
about
harvest
they
are
not
to
be
found
where
there
was
before
great
plenty
of
them
this
well
accounts
for
the
vast
quantities
that
are
caught
about
that
time
on
the
south
downs
near
lewes
where
they
are
esteemed
a
delicacy
there
have
been
shepherds
i
have
been
credibly
informed
that
have
made
many
pounds
in
a
season
by
catching
them
in
traps
and
though
such
multitudes
are
taken
i
never
saw
and
i
am
well
acquainted
with
those
parts
above
two
or
three
at
a
time
for
they
are
never
gregarious
they
may
perhaps
migrate
in
general
and
for
that
purpose
draw
towards
the
coast
of
sussex
in
autumn
but
that
they
do
not
all
withdraw
i
am
sure
because
i
see
a
few
stragglers
in
many
counties
at
all
times
of
the
year
especially
about
warrens
and
stone
quarries
i
have
no
acquaintance
at
present
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
navy
but
have
written
to
a
friend
who
was
a
in
the
late
war
desiring
him
to
look
into
his
minutes
with
respect
to
birds
that
settled
on
their
rigging
during
their
voyage
up
or
down
the
channel
what
hasselquist
says
on
that
subject
is
remarkable
there
were
little
birds
frequently
coming
on
board
his
ship
all
the
way
from
our
channel
quite
up
to
the
levant
especially
before
squally
weather
what
you
suggest
with
regard
to
spain
is
highly
probable
the
winters
of
andalusia
are
so
mild
that
in
all
likelihood
the
billed
birds
that
leave
us
at
that
season
may
find
insects
sufficient
to
support
them
there
some
young
man
possessed
of
fortune
health
and
leisure
should
make
an
autumnal
voyage
into
that
kingdom

should
spend
a
year
there

the
natural
history
of
that
vast
country

an
errand

to

though

i
find
that
in

burrow
deep
in
the
earth
and
make
warm
beds
of
grass

their
grand
rendezvous
seems
to
be
in
into
which
they
are
carried
at

a
neighbour
housed
an
lately
under
the
thatch
of
which
were
assembled
near
an
hundred
most
of
which
were
taken
and
some
i
saw
i
measured
them
and
found
that
from
nose
to
tail
they
were
just
two
inches
and
a
quarter
and
their
tails
just
two
inches
long
two
of
them
in
a
scale
weighed
down
just
one
copper
halfpenny
which
is
about
a

my

fourteen
degrees

the

it

providential
that

letter

march
dear
sir
if
some

would
procure
the
head
of
a
deer
and
have
it
dissected
he
would
find
it
furnished
with
two
spiracula
or
beside
the
nostrils
probably
analogous
to
the
puncta
lachrymalia
in
the
human

when
the
deer
are
thirsty
they
plunge
their
noses
like
some
horses
very
deep
under
water
while
in
the
act
of
drinking
and
continue
them
in
that
situation
for
a
considerable
time

to
obviate
any

they
can
open
two
vents
one
at
the
inner
corner
of

having

mouths
and
nostrils
were
stopped
this
curious
formation
of
the
head
may
be
of
singular
service
to
beasts
of
chase
by
affording
them
free
respiration
and
no
doubt
these
additional
nostrils
are
thrown
open
when
they
are
hard
run
ray
observed
that
at
malta
the
owners
slit
up
the
nostrils
of
such
asses
as
were
hard
worked
for
they
being
naturally
strait
or
small
did
not
admit
air
sufficient
serve
them
when
they
travelled
or
laboured
in
that
hot
climate
and
we
know
that
grooms
and
gentlemen
of
the
turf
think
large
nostrils
necessary
and
a
perfection
in
hunters
and
running
horses

answer
to
this
account
pennant
sent
me
the
following
curious
and
pertinent
reply
was
much
surprised
to
find
in
the
antelope
something
analogous
to
what
you
mention
as
so
remarkable
in
deer
this
animal
has
a
long
slit
beneath
each
eye
which
can
be
opened
and
shut
at
pleasure
on
holding
an
orange
to
one
the
creature
made
as
much
use
of
those
orifices
as
of
his
nostrils
applying
them
to
the
fruit
and
seeming
to
smell
it
through
them
oppian
the
greek
poet
by
the

line

to

mark
dear
sir
some
intelligent
country
people
have
a
notion
that
we
have
in
these
parts
a
species
of
the
genus
mustelinum
besides
the
weasel
stoat
ferret
and
polecat
a
little
reddish
beast
not
much
bigger
than
a
field
mouse
but
much
longer
which
they
call
a
cane
this
piece
of
intelligence
can
be
little
depended
on
but
farther
inquiry
may
be
made
a
gentleman
in
this
neighbourhood
had
two
rooks
in
one
nest
a
booby
of
a
carter
finding
them
before
they
were
able
to
fly
threw
them
down
and
destroyed
them
to
the
regret
of
the
owner
who
would
have
been
glad
to
have
preserved
such
a
curiosity
in
his
rookery
i
saw
the
birds
myself
nailed
against
the
end
of
a
barn
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
their
bills
legs
feet
and
claws
were
a
shepherd
saw
as
he
thought
some
white
larks
on
a
down
above
my
house
this
winter
were
not
these
the
emberiza
nivalis
the
of
the
brit
no
doubt
they
were
a
few
years
ago
i
saw
a
cock
bullfinch
in
a
cage
which
had
been
caught
in
the
fields
after
it
had
come
to
its
full
colours
in
about
a
year
it
began
to
look
dingy
and
blackening
every
succeeding
year
it
became
at
the
end
of
four
its
chief
food
was
seed
such
influence
has
food
on
the
colour
of
animals
the
pied
and
mottled
colours
of
domesticated
animals
are
supposed
to
be
owing
to
high
various
and
unusual
food
i
had
remarked
for
years
that
the
root
of
the
arum
was
frequently
scratched
out
of
the
dry
banks
of
hedges
and
eaten
in
severe
snowy
weather
after
observing
with
some
exactness
myself
and
getting
others
to
do
the
same
we
found
it
was
the
thrush
kind
that
searched
it
out
the
root
of
the
arum
is
remarkably
warm
and
pungent
our
flocks
of
female
chaffinches
have
not
yet
forsaken
us
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
are
very
much
thinned
down
by
that
fierce
weather
in
january
in
the
middle
of
february
i
discovered
in
my
tall
hedges
a
little
bird
that
raised
my
curiosity
it
was
of
that
colour
that
belongs
to
the
salicaria
kind
and
i
think
was
it
was
no
parus
and
was
too
long
and
too
big
for
the
wren
appearing
most
like
the
largest
it
hung
sometimes
with
its
back
downwards
but
never
continuing
one
moment
in
the
same
place
i
shot
at
it
but
it
was
so
desultory
that
i
missed
my
aim
i
wonder
that
the
stone
curlew
charadrius
oedicnemus
should
be
mentioned
by
the
writers
as
a
rare
bird
it
abounds
in
all
the
champaign
parts
of
hampshire
and
sussex
and
breeds
i
think
all
the
summer
having
young
ones
i
know
very
late
in
the
autumn
already
they
begin
clamouring
in
the
evening
they
can
not
i
think
with
any
propriety
be
called
as
they
are
by
ray
aquas
versantes
for
with
us
by
day
at
least
they
haunt
only
the
most
dry
open
upland
fields
and
sheep
walks
far
removed
from
water
what
they
may
do
in
the
night
i
can
not
say
worms
are
their
usual
food
but
they
also
eat
toads
and
frogs
i
can
show
you
some
good
specimens
of

letter
xvi
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
april
dear
sir
the
history
of
the
stone
curlew
charadrius
oedicnemus
is
as
follows
it
lays
its
eggs
usually
two
never
more
than
three
on
the
bare
ground
without
any
nest
in
the
field
so
that
the
countryman
in
stirring
his
fallows
often
destroys
them
the
young
run
immediately
from
the
egg
like
partridges
and
are
withdrawn
to
some
flinty
field
by
their
dam
where
they
skulk
among
the
stones
which
are
their
best
security
for
their
feathers
are
so
exactly
of
the
colour
of
our
grey
spotted
flints
that
the
most
exact
observer
unless
he
catches
the
eye
of
the
young
bird
may
be
eluded
the
eggs
are
short
and
round
of
a
dirty
white
spotted
with
dark
bloody
blotches
though
i
might
not
be
able
just
when
i
pleased
to
procure
you
a
bird
yet
i
could
show
you
them
almost
any
day
and
any
evening
you
may
hear
them
round
the
village
for
they
make
a
clamour
which
may
be
heard
a
mile
oedicnemus
is
a
most
apt
and
expressive
name
for
them
since
their
legs
seem
swollen
like
those
of
a
gouty
man
after
harvest
i
have
shot
them
before
the
pointers
in
i
make
no
doubt
but
there
are
three
species
of
the
two
i
know
perfectly
but
have
not
been
able
yet
to
procure
the
third
no
two
birds
can
differ
more
in
their
notes
and
that
constancy
than
those
two
that
i
am
acquainted
with
for
the
one
has
a
joyous
easy
laughing
note
the
other
a
harsh
loud
chirp
the
former
is
every
way
larger
and
of
an
inch
longer
and
weighs
two
drams
and
a
half
while
the
latter
weighs
but
two
so
the
songster
is
heavier
than
the
chirper
the
chirper
being
the
first
of
passage
that
is
heard
the
wryneck
sometimes
excepted
begins
his
two
notes
in
the
middle
of
march
and
continues
them
through
the
spring
and
summer
till
the
end
of
august
as
appears
by
my
journals
the
legs
of
the
larger
of
these
two
are
of
the
less
black
the
began
his
sibilous
note
in
my
fields
last
saturday
nothing
can
be
more
amusing
than
the
whisper
of
this
little
bird
which
seems
to
be
close
by
though
at
an
hundred
yards
distance
and
when
close
at
your
ear
is
scarce
any
louder
than
when
a
great
way
off
had
i
not
been
a
little
acquainted
with
insects
and
known
that
the
grasshopper
kind
is
not
yet
hatched
i
should
have
hardly
believed
but
that
it
had
been
a
locusta
whispering
in
the
bushes
the
country
people
laugh
when
you
tell
them
that
it
is
the
note
of
a
bird
it
is
a
most
artful
creature
skulking
in
the
thickest
part
of
a
bush
and
will
sing
at
a
yard
distance
provided
it
be
concealed
i
was
obliged
to
get
a
person
to
go
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
where
it
haunted
and
then
it
would
run
creeping
like
a
mouse
before
us
for
a
hundred
yards
together
through
the
bottom
of
the
thorns
yet
it
would
not
come
into
fair
sight
but
in
a
morning
early
and
when
undisturbed
it
sings
on
the
top
of
a
twig
gaping
and
shivering
with
its
wings
ray
himself
had
no
knowledge
of
this
bird
but
received
his
account
from
johnson
who
apparently
confounds
it
with
the
reguli
non

from
which
it
is
very
distinct
see

letters
the
stoparola

redstart

to
sing
its
note
is
short
and
imperfect
but
is
continued
till
about
the
middle
of
june
the

are
horrid

letter

june
dear
sir
on
wednesday
last
arrived
your
agreeable
letter
of
june
the
it
gives
me
great
satisfaction
to
find
that
you
pursue
these
studies
still
with
such
vigour
and
are
in
such
forwardness
with
regard
to
reptiles
and
fishes
the
reptiles
few
as
they
are
i
am
not
acquainted
with
so
well
as
i
could
wish
with
regard
to
their
natural
history
there
is
a
degree
of
dubiousness
and
obscurity
attending
the
propagation
of
this
class
of
animals
sometimes
analogous
to
that
of
the
cryptogamia
in
the
sexual
system
of
plants
and
the
case
is
the
same
as
regards
some
of
the
fishes
as
the
eel
etc
the
method
in
which
toads
procreate
and
bring
forth
seems
to
me
very
much
in
the
dark
some
authors
say
that
they
are
viviparous
and
yet
ray
classes
them
among
his
oviparous
animals
and
is
silent
with
regard
to
the
manner
of
their
bringing
forth
perhaps
they
may
be
eso
men
ootokoi
exo
de
dzootokoi
in
greek
as
is
known
to
be
the
case
with
the
viper
the
copulation
of
frogs
or
at
least
the
appearance
of
it
for
swammerdam
proves
that
the
male
has
no
penis
intrans
is
notorious
to
everybody
because
we
see
them
sticking
upon
each
other
backs
for
a
month
together
in
spring
and
yet
i
never
saw
or
read
of
toads
being
observed
in
the
same
situation
it
is
strange
that
the
matter
with
regard
to
the
venom
of
toads
has
not
yet
been
settled
that
they
are
not
noxious
to
some
animals
is
plain
for
ducks
buzzards
owls
stone
curlews
and
snakes
eat
them
to
my
knowledge
with
impunity
and
i
well
remember
the
time
but
was
not
to
the
fact
though
numbers
of
persons
were
when
a
quack
at
this
village
ate
a
toad
to
make
the
country
people
stare
afterwards
he
drank
oil
i
have
been
informed
also
from
undoubted
authority
that
some
ladies
ladies
you
will
say
of
peculiar
taste
took
a
fancy
to
a
toad
which
they
nourished
summer
after
summer
for
many
years
till
he
grew
to
a
monstrous
size
with
the
maggots
which
turn
to
flesh
flies
the
reptile
used
to
come
forth
every
evening
from
an
hole
under
the
and
was
taken
up
after
supper
on
the
table
to
be
fed
but
at
last
a
tame
raven
kenning
him
as
he
put
forth
his
head
gave
him
such
a
severe
stroke
with
his
horny
beak
as
put
out
one
eye
after
this
accident
the
creature
languished
for
some
time
and
died
i
need
not
remind
a
gentleman
of
your
extensive
reading
of
the
excellent
account
there
is
from
derham
in
ray
wisdom
of
god
in
the
creation
concerning
the
migration
of
frogs
from
their
breeding
ponds
in
this
account
he
at
once
subverts
that
foolish
opinion
of
their
dropping
from
the
clouds
in
rain
showing
that
it
is
from
the
grateful
coolness
and
moisture
of
those
showers
that
they
are
tempted
to
set
out
on
their
travels
which
they
defer
till
those
fall
frogs
are
as
yet
in
their
tadpole
state
but
in
a
few
weeks
our
lanes
paths
fields
will
swarm
for
a
few
days
with
myriads
of
these
emigrants
no
larger
than
my
little
finger
nail
swammerdam
gives
a
most
accurate
account
of
the
method
and
situation
in
which
the
male
impregnates
the
spawn
of
the
female
how
wonderful
is
the
oeconomy
of
providence
with
regard
to
the
limbs
of
so
vile
a
reptile
while
it
is
aquatic
it
has
a
tail
and
no
legs
as
soon
as
the
legs
sprout
the
tail
drops
off
as
useless
and
the
animal
betakes
itself
to
the
land
merret
i
trust
is
widely
mistaken
when
he
advances
that
the
rana
arborea
is
an
english
reptile
it
abounds
in
germany
and
switzerland
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
salamandra
aquatica
of
ray
the
or
eft
will
frequently
bite
at
the
angler
bait
and
is
often
caught
on
his
hook
i
used
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
salamandra
aquatica
was
hatched
lived
and
died
in
the
water
but
john
ellis
the
coralline
ellis
asserts
in
a
letter
to
the
royal
society
dated
june
in
his
account
of
the
mud
inguana
an
amphibious
bides
from
south
carolina
that
the
eft
or
newt
is
only
the
larva
of
the
as
tadpoles
are
of
frogs
lest
i
should
be
suspected
to
misunderstand
his
meaning
i
shall
give
it
in
his
own
words
speaking
of
the
opercula
or
covering
to
the
gills
of
the
mud
inguana
he
proceeds
to
say
that
forms
of
these
pennated
coverings
approach
very
near
to
what
i
have
some
time
ago
observed
in
the
larva
or
aquatic
state
of
our
english
lacerta
known
by
the
name
of
eft
or
newt
which
serve
them
for
coverings
to
their
gills
and
for
fins
to
swim
with
while
in
this
state
and
which
they
lose
as
well
as
the
fins
of
their
tails
when
they
change
their
state
and
become
land
animals
as
i
have
observed
by
keeping
them
alive
for
some
time
myself
linnaeus
in
his
systema
naturae
hints
at
what
ellis
advances
more
than
once
providence
has
been
so
indulgent
to
us
as
to
allow
of
but
one
venomous
reptile
of
the
serpent
kind
in
these
kingdoms
and
that
is
the
viper
as
you
propose
the
good
of
mankind
to
be
an
object
of
your
publications
you
will
not
omit
to
mention
common
as
a
sovereign
remedy
against
the
bite
of
the
viper
as
to
the
blind
worm
anguis

so
called
because
it
snaps
in
sunder
with

small
blow

have
found
on
examination
that

perfectly
innocuous

neighbouring
yeoman

her
filled
with
a

of
eleven

about
the

none
of

were
advanced
so
far
towards
a
state
of
maturity
as
to
contain

they

they
are
viviparous

hatching
their

dear
sir
i
received
your
obliging
and
communicative
letter
of
june
the
while
i
was
on
a
visit
at
a
gentleman
house
where
i
had
neither
books
to
turn
to
nor
leisure
to
sit
down
to
return
you
an
answer
to
many
queries
which
i
wanted
to
resolve
in
the
best
manner
that
i
am
able
a
person
by
my
order
has
searched
our
brooks
but
could
find
no
such
fish
as
the
gasterosteus
pungitius
he
found
the
gasterosteus
aculeatus
in
plenty
this
morning
in
a
basket
i
packed
a
little
earthen
pot
full
of
wet
moss
and
in
it
some
sticklebacks
male
and
female
the
females
big
with
spawn
some
lamperns
some
heads
but
i
could
produce
no
minnows
this
basket
will
be
in
by
eight
this
evening
so
i
hope
mazel
will
have
them
fresh
and
fair
morning
i
gave
some
directions
in
a
letter
to
what
particulars
the
engraver
should
be
attentive
finding
while
i
was
on
a
visit
that
i
was
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
ambresbury
i
sent
a
servant
over
to
that
town
and
procured
several
diving
specimens
of
loaches
which
he
brought
safe
and
brisk
in
a
glass
decanter
they
were
taken
in
the
gullies
that
were
cut
for
watering
the
meadows
from
these
fishes
which
measured
from
two
to
four
inches
in
length
i
took
the
following
description
loach
in
its
general
aspect
has
a
pellucid
appearance
its
back
is
mottled
with
irregular
collections
of
small
black
dots
not
reaching
much
below
the
linea

as
are
the
back
and

a
black

runs
from
each

down
to
the

its

is
of
a

the

projects
beyond
the

it

broad

as
to
be
characteristic
of
this

the

of

appears
to
be

active

fish
in
my
visit
i
was
not
very
far
from
hungerford
and
did
not
forget
to
make
some
inquiries
concerning
the
wonderful
method
of
curing
cancers
by
means
of
toads
several
intelligent
persons
both
gentry
and
clergy
do
i
find
give
a
great
deal
of
credit
to
what
was
asserted
in
the
papers
and
i
myself
dined
with
a
clergyman
who
seemed
to
be
persuaded
that
what
is
related
is
matter
of
fact
but
when
i
came
to
attend
to
his
account
i
thought
i
discerned
circumstances
which
did
not
a
little
invalidate
the
woman
story
of
the
manner
in
which
she
came
by
her
skill
she
says
of
herself
labouring
under
a
virulent
cancer
she
went
to
some
church
where
there
was
a
vast
crowd
on
going
into
a
pew
she
was
accosted
by
a
strange
clergyman
who
after
expressing
compassion
for
her
situation
told
her
chat
if
she
would
make
such
an
application
of
living
toads
as
is
mentioned
she
would
be
well
now
is
it
likely
that
this
unknown
gentleman
should
express
so
much
tenderness
for
this
single
sufferer
and
not
feel
any
for
the
many
thousands
that
daily
languish
under
this
terrible
disorder
would
he
not
have
made
use
of
this
invaluable
nostrum
for
his
own
emolument
or
at
least
by
some
means
of
publication
or
other
have
found
a
method
of
making
it
public

the
good
of
mankind

dear
sir
i
have
now
past
dispute
made
out
three
distinct
species
of
the
motacillae
trochili
which
constantly
and
invariably
use
distinct
notes
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
i
know
nothing
of
your
in
my
letter
of
april
the
i
told
you
peremptorily
that
i
knew
your
but
had
not
seen
it
then
but
when
i
came
to
procure
it
it
proved
in
all
respects
a
very
motacilla
trochilus
only
that
it
is
a
size
larger
than
the
two
other
and
the
of
the
whole
upper
part
of
the
body
is
more
vivid
and
the
belly
of
a
clearer
white
i
have
specimens
of
the
three
sorts
now
lying
before
me
and
can
discern
that
there
are
three
gradations
of
sizes
and
that
the
least
has
black
legs
and
the
other
two
ones
the
yellowest
bird
is
considerably
the
largest
and
has
its
and
secondary
feathers
tipped
with
white
which
the
others
have
not
this
last
haunts
only
the
tops
of
trees
in
high
beechen
woods
and
makes
a
sibilous
noise
now
and
then
at
short
intervals
shivering
a
little
with
its
wings

it

make
no
doubt
now
the

this

never
suspected
that
there
were

letter
xx
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
october
it
is
i
find
in
zoology
as
it
is
in
botany
all
nature
is
so
full
that
that
district
produces
the
greatest
variety
which
is
the
most
examined
several
birds
which
are
said
to
belong
to
the
north
only
are
it
seems
often
in
the
south
i
have
discovered
this
summer
three
species
of
birds
with
us
which
writers
mention
as
only
to
be
seen
in
the
northern
counties
the
first
that
was
brought
me
on
the
of
may
was
the
sandpiper
tringa
hypoleucus
it
was
a
cock
bird
and
haunted
the
banks
of
some
ponds
near
the
village
and
as
it
had
a
companion
doubtless
intended
to
have
bred
near
that
water
besides
the
owner
has
told
me
since
that
on
recollection
he
has
seen
some
of
the
same
birds
round
his
ponds
in
former
summers
the
next
bird
that
i
procured
on
the
of
may
was
a
male
backed
butcher
bird
lanius
collurio
my
neighbour
who
shot
it
says
that
it
might
easily
have
escaped
his
notice
had
not
the
outcries
and
chattering
of
the
and
other
small
birds
drawn
his
attention
to
the
bush
where
it
was
its
craw
was
filled
with
the
legs
and
wings
of
beetles
the
next
rare
birds
which
were
procured
for
me
last
week
were
some
turdi
torquati
this
week
twelve
months
a
gentleman
from
london
being
with
us
was
amusing
himself
with
a
gun
and
found
he
told
us
on
an
old
yew
hedge
where
there
were
berries
some
birds
like
blackbirds
with
rings
of
white
round
their
necks
a
neighbouring
farmer
also
at
the
same
time
observed
the
same
but
as
no
specimens
were
procured
little
notice
was
taken
i
mentioned
this
circumstance
to
you
in
my
letter
of
november
the
you
however
paid
but
small
regard
to
what
i
said
as
i
had
not
seen
these
birds
myself
but
last
week
the
aforesaid
farmer
seeing
a
large
flock
twenty
or
thirty
of
these
birds
shot
two
cocks
and
two
hens
and
says
on
recollection
that
he
remembers
to
have
observed
these
birds
again
last
spring
about
as
it
were
on
their
return
to
the
north
now
perhaps
these
ousels
are
not
the
ousels
of
the
north
of
england
but
belong
to
the
more
northern
parts
of
europe
and
may
retire
before
the
excessive
rigour
of
the
frosts
in
those
parts
and
return
to
breed
in
the
spring
when
the
cold
abates
if
this
be
the
case
here
is
discovered
a
new
bird
of
winter
passage
concerning
whose
migrations
the
writers
are
silent
but
if
these
birds
should
prove
the
ousels
of
the
north
of
england
then
here
is
a
migration
disclosed
within
our
own
kingdom
never
before
remarked
it
does
not
yet
appear
whether
they
retire
beyond
the
bounds
of
our
island
to
the
south
but
it
is
most
probable
that
they
usually
do
or
else
one
can
not
suppose
that
they
would
have
continued
so
long
unnoticed
in
the
southern
counties
the
ousel
is
larger
than
a
blackbird
and
feeds
on
haws
but
last
autumn
when
there
were
no
haws
it
fed
on
in
the
spring
it
feeds
on
which
ripen
only
at
that
season
in
march
and
april
i
must
not
omit
to
tell
you
as
you
have
been
so
lately
on
the
study
of
reptiles
that
my
people
every
now
and
then
of
late
draw
up
with
a
bucket
of
water
from
my
well
which
is
feet
deep
a
large
black
warty
lizard
with
a
and
yellow
belly
how
they
first
came
down
at
that
depth
and
how
they
were
ever
to
have
got
out
thence
without
help
is
more
than
i
am
able
to
say
my
thanks
are
due
to
you
for
your
trouble
and
care
in
the
examination
of
a
buck
head
as
far
as
your
discoveries
reach
at
present
they
seem
much
to
corroborate
my
suspicions
and
i
hope
may
find
reason
to
give
his
decision
in
my
favour
and
then
i
think
we
may
advance
this
extraordinary
provision
of
nature
as
a
new
instance
of
the
wisdom
of
god
in
the
creation
as
yet
i
have
not
quite
done
with
my
history
of
the
oedicnemus
or
stone
curlew
for
i
shall
desire
a
gentleman
in
sussex
near
whose
house
these
birds
congregate
in
vast
flocks
in
the
autumn
to
observe
nicely
when
they
leave
him
if
they
do
leave
him
and
when
they
return
again
in
the
spring
i
was
with
this
gentleman
lately
and
saw
several
single
birds
letter
xxi
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
with
regard
to
the
oedicnemus
or
stone
curlew
i
intend
to
write
very
soon
to
my
friend
near
chichester
in
whose
neighbourhood
these
birds
seem
most
to
abound
and
shall
urge
him
to
take
particular
notice
when
they
begin
to
congregate
and
afterwards
to
watch
them
most
narrowly
whether
they
do
not
withdraw
themselves
during
the
dead
of
the
winter
when
i
have
obtained
information
with
respect
to
this
circumstance
i
shall
have
finished
my
history
of
the
stone
curlew
which
i
hope
will
prove
to
your
satisfaction
as
it
will
be
i
trust
very
near
the
truth
this
gentleman
as
he
occupies
a
large
farm
of
his
own
and
is
abroad
early
and
late
will
be
a
very
proper
spy
upon
the
motions
of
these
birds
and
besides
as
i
have
prevailed
on
him
to
buy
the
naturalist
journal
with
which
he
is
much
delighted
i
shall
expect
that
he
will
be
very
exact
in
his
dates
it
is
very
extraordinary
as
you
observe
that
a
bird
so
common
with
us
should
never
straggle
to
you
and
here
will
be
the
properest
place
to
mention
while
i
think
of
it
an
anecdote
which
the
gentleman
told
me
when
i
was
last
at
his
house
which
was
that
in
a
warren
joining
to
his
outlet
many
daws
corvi
monedulae
build
every
year
in
the
rabbit
burrows
under
ground
the
way
he
and
his
brothers
used
to
take
their
nests
while
they
were
boys
was
by
listening
at
the
mouths
of
the
holes
and
if
they
heard
the
young
ones
cry
they
twisted
the
nest
out
with
a
forked
stick
some
the
puffins
breed
i
know
in
that
manner
but
i
should
never
have
suspected
the
daws
of
building
in
holes
on
the
flat
ground
another
very
unlikely
spot
is
made
use
of
by
daws
as
a
place
to
breed
in
and
that
is
stonehenge
these
birds
deposit
their
nests
in
the
interstices
between
the
upright
and
the
impost
stones
of
that
amazing
work
of
antiquity
which
circumstance
alone
speaks
the
prodigious
height
of
the
upright
stones
that
they
should
be
tall
enough
to
secure
those
nests
from
the
annoyance
of
who
are
always
idling
round
that
place
one
of
my
neighbours
last
saturday
november
the
saw
a
martin
in
a
sheltered
bottom
the
sun
shone
warm
and
the
bird
was
hawking
briskly
after
flies
i
am
now
perfectly
satisfied
that
they
do
not
all
leave
this
island
in
the
winter
you
judge
very
right
i
think
in
speaking
with
reserve
and
caution
concerning
the
cures
done
by
toads
for
let
people
advance
what
they
will
on
such
subjects
yet
there
is
such
a
propensity
in
mankind
towards
deceiving
and
being
deceived
that
one
can
not
safely
relate
any
thing
from
common
report
especially
in
print
without
expressing
some
degree
of
doubt
and
suspicion
your
approbation
with
regard
to
my
new
discovery
of
the
migration
of
the
gives
me
satisfaction
and
i
find
you
concur
with
me
in
suspecting
that
they
are
foreign
birds
which
visit
us
you
will
be
sure
i
hope
not
to
omit
to
make
inquiry
whether
your
leave
your
rocks
in
the
autumn
what
puzzles
me
most
is
the
very
short
stay
they
make
with
us
for
in
about
three
weeks
they
are
all
gone
i
shall
be
very
curious
to
remark
whether
they
will
call
on
us
at
their
return
in
the
spring
as
they
did
last
year
i
want
to
be
better
informed
with
regard
to
ichthyology
if
fortune
had
settled
me
near
the
or
near
some
great
river
my
natural
propensity
would
soon
have
urged
me
to
have
made
myself
acquainted
with
their
productions
but
as
i
have
lived
mostly
in
inland

dear
sir
as
to
the
peculiarity
of
jackdaws
building
with
us
under
the
ground
in
you
have
in
part
hit
upon
the
reason
for
in
reality
there
are
hardly
any
towers
or
steeples
in
all
this
country
and
perhaps
norfolk
excepted
hampshire
and
sussex
are
as
meanly
furnished
with
churches
as
almost
any
counties
in
the
kingdom
we
have
many
livings
of
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
whose
houses
of
worship
make
little
better
appearance
than
dovecots
when
i
first
saw
northamptonshire
cambridgeshire
and
huntingdonshire
and
the
fens
of
lincolnshire
i
was
amazed
at
the
number
of
spires
which
presented
themselves
in
every
point
of
view
as
an
admirer
of
prospects
i
have
reason
to
lament
this
want
in
my
own
country
for
such
objects
are
very
necessary
ingredients
in
an
elegant
landscape
what
you
mention
with
respect
to
reclaimed
toads
raises
my
curiosity
an
ancient
author
though
no
naturalist
has
well
remarked
that
kind
of
beasts
and
of
birds
and
of
serpents

of

it
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
find
that
a
green
lizard
has
actually
been
procured
for
you
in
devonshire
because
it
corroborates
my
discovery
which
i
made
many
years
ago
of
the
same
sort
on
a
sunny
sandbank
near
farnham
in
surrey
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
south
hams
of
devonshire
and
can
suppose
that
district
from
its
southerly
situation
to
be
a
proper
habitation
for
such
animals
in
their
best
colours
since
the
of
your
vast
mountains
do
certainly
not
forsake
them
against
winter
our
suspicions
that
those
which
visit
this
neighbourhood
about
michaelmas
are
not
english
birds
but
driven
from
the
more
northern
parts
of
europe
by
the
frosts
are
still
more
reasonable
and
it
will
be
worth
your
pains
to
endeavour
to
trace
from
whence
they
come
and
to
inquire
why
they
make
so
very
short
a
stay
in
your
account
of
your
error
with
regard
to
the
two
species
of
herons
you
incidentally
gave
me
great
entertainment
in
your
description
of
the
heronry
at
which
is
a
curiosity
i
could
never
manage
to
see
fourscore
nests
of
such
a
bird
on
one
tree
is
a
rarity
which
i
would
ride
half
as
many
miles
to
have
a
sight
of
pray
be
sure
to
tell
me
in
your
next
whose
seat
is
and
near
what
town
it
lies
i
have
often
thought
that
those
vast
extents
of
fens
have
never
been
sufficiently
explored
if
half
a
dozen
gentlemen
furnished
with
a
good
strength
of
were
to
beat
them
over
for
a
week
they
would
certainly
find
more
species
is
near
spalding
in
lincolnshire
there
is
no
bird
i
believe
whose
manners
i
have
studied
more
than
that
of
the
caplimulgus
the
as
it
is
a
wonderful
and
curious
creature
but
i
have
always
found
that
though
sometimes
it
may
chatter
as
it
flies
as
i
know
it
does
yet
in
general
it
utters
its
jarring
note
sitting
on
a
bough
and
i
have
for
many
an
half
hour
watched
it
as
it
sat
with
its
under
mandible
quivering
and
particularly
this
summer
it
perches
usually
on
a
bare
twig
with
its
head
lower
than
its
tail
in
an
attitude
well
expressed
by
your
draughtsman
in
the
folio
british
zoology
this
bird
is
most
punctual
in
beginning
its
song
exactly
at
the
close
of
day
so
exactly
that
i
have
known
it
strike
up
more
than
once
or
twice
just
at
the
report
of
the
portsmouth
evening
gun
which
we
can
hear
when
the
weather
is
still
it
appears
to
me
past
all
doubt
that
its
notes
are
formed
by
organic
impulse
by
the
powers
of
the
parts
of
its
windpipe
formed
for
sound
just
as
cats
pur
you
will
credit
me
i
hope
when
i
tell
you
that
as
my
neighbours
were
assembled
in
an
hermitage
on
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
where
we
drink
tea
one
of
these
came
and
settled
on
the
cross
of
that
little
straw
edifice
and
began
to
chatter
and
continued
his
note
for
many
minutes
and
we
were
all
struck
with
wonder
to
find
that
the
organs
of
that
little
animal
when
put
in
motion
gave
a
sensible
vibration
to
the
whole
building
this
bird
also
sometimes
makes
a
small
squeak
repeated
four
or
five
times
and
i
have
observed
that
to
happen
when
the
cock
has
been
pursuing
the
hen
in
a
toying
way
through
the
boughs
of
a
tree
it
would
not
be
at
all
strange
if
your
bat
which
you
have
procured
should
prove
a
new
one
since
five
species
have
been
found
in
a
neighbouring
kingdom
the
great
sort
that
i
mentioned
is
certainly
a
nondescript
i
saw
but
one
this
summer
and
that
i
had
no
opportunity
of
taking
your
account
of
the
was
entertaining
i
am
no
angler
myself
but
inquiring
of
those
that
are
what
they
supposed
that
part
of
their
tackle
to
be
made
of
they
replied
the
intestines
of
a
silkworm
though
i
must
not
pretend
to
great
skill
in
entomology
yet
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
ignorant
of
that
kind
of
knowledge
i
may
now
and
then
perhaps
be
able
to
furnish
you
with
a
little
information
the
vast
rains
ceased
with
us
much
about
the
same
time
as
with
you
and
since
we
have
had
delicate
weather
barker
who
has
measured
the
rain
for
more
than
thirty
years
says
in
a
late
letter
that
more
has
fallen
this
year
than
in
any
he
ever
attended
to
though
from
july
to

more
fell
than
in
any
seven
months
of

letter
xxiii
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
february
dear
sir
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
guernsey
lizard
and
our
green
lizard
may
be
specifically
the
same
all
that
i
know
is
that
when
some
years
ago
many
guernsey
lizards
were
turned
loose
in
pembroke
college
garden
in
the
university
of
oxford
they
lived
a
great
while
and
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
very
well
but
never
bred
whether
this
circumstance
will
prove
anything
either
way
i
shall
not
pretend
to
say
i
return
you
thanks
for
your
account
of
but
recollect
not
without
regret
that
in
june
i
was
visiting
for
a
week
together
at
spalding
without
ever
being
told
that
such
a
curiosity
was
just
at
hand
pray
send
me
word
in
your
next
what
sort
of
tree
it
is
that
contains
such
a
quantity
of
herons
nests
and
whether
the
heronry
consists
of
a
whole
grove
or
wood
or
only
of
a
few
trees
it
gave
me
satisfaction
to
find
that
we
accorded
so
well
about
the
caprimulgus
all
i
contended
for
was
to
prove
that
it
often
chatters
sitting
as
well
as
flying
and
therefore
the
noise
was
voluntary
and
from
organic
impulse
and
not
from
the
resistance
of
the
air
against
the
hollow
of
its
mouth
and
throat
if
ever
i
saw
anything
like
actual
migration
it
was
last
i
was
travelling
and
out
early
in
the
morning
at
first
there
was
a
vast
fog
but
by
the
time
that
i
was
got
seven
or
eight
miles
from
home
towards
the
coast
the
sun
broke
out
into
a
delicate
warm
day
we
were
then
on
a
large
heath
or
common
and
i
could
discern
as
the
mist
began
to
break
away
great
numbers
of
swallows
hirundines
rusticae
clustering
on
the
stinted
shrubs
and
bushes
as
if
they
had
roosted
there
all
night
as
soon
as
the
air
became
clear
and
pleasant
they
all
were
on
the
wing
at
once
and
by
a
placid
and
easy
flight
proceeded
on
southward
towards
the
sea
after
this
i
did
not
see
any
more
flocks
only
now
and
then
a
straggler
i
can
not
agree
with
those
persons
that
assert
that
the
swallow
kind
disappear
some
and
some
gradually
as
they
come
for
the
bulk
of
them
seem
to
withdraw
at
once
only
some
stragglers
stay
behind
a
long
while
and
do
never
there
is
the
greatest
reason
to
believe
leave
this
island
swallows
seem
to
lay
themselves
up
and
to
come
forth
in
a
warm
day
as
bats
do
continually
of
a
warm
evening
after
they
have
disappeared
for
weeks
for
a
very
respectable
gentleman
assured
me
that
as
he
was
walking
with
some
friends
under
on
a
remarkably
hot
noon
either
in
the
last
week
in
december
or
the
first
week
in
january
he
espied
three
or
four
swallows
huddled
together
on
the
moulding
of
one
of
the
windows
of
that
college
i
have
frequently
remarked
that
swallows
are
seen
later
at
oxford
than
elsewhere
is
it
owing
to
the
vast
massy
buildings
of
that
place
to
the
many
waters
round
it
or
to
what
else
when
i
used
to
rise
in
a
morning
last
autumn
and
see
the
swallows
and
martins
clustering
on
the
chimneys
and
thatch
of
the
neighbouring
cottages
i
could
not
help
being
touched
with
a
secret
delight
mixed
with
some
degree
of
mortification
with
delight
to
observe
with
how
much
ardour
and
punctuality
those
poor
little
birds
obeyed
the
strong
impulse
towards
migration
or
hiding
imprinted
on
their
minds
by
their
great
creator
and
with
some
degree
of
mortification
when
i
reflected
that
after
all
our
pains
and
inquiries
we
are
yet
not
quite
certain
to
what
regions
they
do
migrate
and
are
still
farther
embarrassed
to
find
that
some
do
not
actually
migrate
at
all
these
reflections
made
so
strong
an
impression
on
my
imagination
that
they
became
productive
of
a
composition
that
may
perhaps
amuse
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
next
i
have
the
honour
of
writing
to
you
letter

thomas

well

but
have
never

able
to
discover

its
natural
state
banks
told
me
he
thought
it
might
be
found
on
the
on
the
thirteenth
of
april
i
went
to
the
where
the
have
been
observed
to
make
their
appearance
at
spring
and
fall
in
their
way
perhaps
to
the
north
or
south
and
was
much
pleased
to
see
three
birds
about
the
usual
spot
we
shot
a
cock
and
a
hen
they
were
plump
and
in
high
condition
the
hen
had
but
very
small
rudiments
of
eggs
within
her
which
proves
they
are
late
breeders
whereas
those
species
of
the
thrush
kind
that
remain
with
us
the
whole
year
have
fledged
young
before
that
time
in
their
crops
was
nothing
very
distinguishable
but
somewhat
that
seemed
like
blades
of
vegetables
nearly
digested
in
autumn
they
feed
on
haws
and
and
in
the
spring
on
i
dressed
one
of
these
birds
and
found
it
juicy
and
it
is
remarkable
that
they
make
but
a
few
days
stay
in
their
spring
visit
but
rest
near
a
fortnight
at
michaelmas
these
birds
from
the
observations
of
three
springs
and
two
autumns
are
most
punctual
in
their
return
and
exhibit
a
new
migration
unnoticed
by
the
writers
who
supposed
they
never
were
to
be
seen
in
any
of
the
southern
counties
one
of
my
neighbours
lately
brought
me
a
new
salicaria
which
at
first
i
suspected
might
have
proved
your
but
on
a
nicer
examination
it
answered
much
better
to
the
description
of
that
species
which
you
shot
at
revesby
in
lincolnshire
my
bird
i
describe
thus
is
a
size
less
than
the
the
head
back
and
coverts
of
the
wings
of
a
dusky
brown
without
those
dark
spots
of
the
over
each
eye
is
a
stroke
the
chin
and
throat
are
white
and
the
under
parts
of
a
yellowish
white
the
rump
is
tawny
and
the
feathers
of
the
tail
the
bill
is
dusky
and
sharp
and
the
legs
are
dusky
the
hinder
claw
long
and
crooked
the
person
that
shot
it
says
that
it
sung
so
like
a
that
he
took
it
for
one
and
that
it
sings
all
night
but
this
account
merits
further
inquiry
for
my
part
i
suspect
it
is
a
second
sort
of
locustella

at
by

also
procured

you
put
with
regard
to
those
genera
of
animals
that
are
peculiar
to
america
viz
how
they
came
there
and
whence
is
too
puzzling
for
me
to
answer
and
yet
so
obvious
as
often
to
have
struck
me
with
wonder
if
one
looks
into
the
writers
on
that
subject
little
satisfaction
is
to
be
found
ingenious
men
will
readily
advance
plausible
arguments
to
support
whatever
theory
they
shall
choose
to
maintain
but
then
the
misfortune
is
every
one
hypothesis
is
each
as
good
as
another
since
they
are
all
founded
on
conjecture
the
late
writers
of
this
sort
in
whom
may
be
seen
all
the
arguments
of
those
that
have
gone
before

i
remember

america
from
the
western
coast
of
africa
and
the
south
of
europe

then
break
down

dear
sir
it
gives
me
satisfaction
to
find
that
my
account
of
the
ousel
migration
pleases
you
you
put
a
very
shrewd
question
when
you
ask
me
how
i
know
that
their
autumnal
migration
is
southward
was
not
candour
and
openness
the
very
life
of
natural
history
i
should
pass
over
this
query
just
as
the
sly
commentator
does
over
a
crabbed
passage
in
a
classic
but
common
ingenuousness
obliges
me
to
confess
not
without
some
degree
of
shame
that
i
only
reasoned
in
that
case
from
analogy
for
as
all
other
autumnal
birds
migrate
from
the
northward
to
us
to
partake
of
our
milder
winters
and
return
to
the
northward
again
when
the
rigorous
cold
abates
so
i
concluded
that
the
did
the
same
as
well
as
their
congeners
the
fieldfares
and
especially
as
are
known
to
haunt
cold
mountainous
countries
but
i
have
good
reason
to
suspect
since
that
they
may
come
to
us
from
westward
because
i
hear
from
very
good
authority
that
they
breed
on
dartmoor
and
that
they
forsake
that
wild
district
about
the
time
that
our
visitors
appear
and
do
not
return
till
late
in
the
spring
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
about
your
salicaria
and
mine
with
a
white
stroke
over
its
eye
and
a
tawny
rump
i
have
surveyed
it
alive
and
dead
and
have
procured
several
specimens
and
am
perfectly
persuaded
myself
and
trust
you
will
soon
be
convinced
of
the
same
that
it
is
no
more
nor
less
than
the
passer
arundinaceus
minor
of
ray
this
bird
by
some
means
or
other
seems
to
be
entirely
omitted
in
the
british
zoology
and
one
reason
probably
was
because
it
is
so
strangely
classed
in
ray
who
ranges
it
among
his
picis
affines
it
ought
no
doubt
to
have
gone
among
his
aviculae
cauda
unicolore
and
among
your
small
birds
of
the
same
division
linnaeus
might
with
great
propriety
have
put
it
into
his
genus
of
motacilla
and
the
motacilla
salicaria
of
his
fauna
suecica
seems
to
come
the
nearest
to
it
it
is
no
uncommon
bird
haunting
the
sides
of
ponds
and
rivers
where
there
is
covert
and
the
reeds
and
sedges
of
moors
the
country
people
in
some
places
call
it
the
it
sings
incessantly
night
and
day
during
the
imitating
the
note
of
a
sparrow
a
swallow
a
and
has
a
strange
hurrying
manner
in
its
song
my
specimens
correspond
most
minutely
to
the
description
of
your
fen
salicaria
shot
near
revesby
ray
has
given
an
excellent
characteristic
of
it
when
he
says
pedes
in
hac
avicula
multo
majores
sunt
quam
pro
corporis
ratione
see
letter
may
i
have
got
you
the
egg
of
an
oedicnemus
or
stone
curlew
which
was
picked
up
in
a
fallow
on
the
naked
ground
there
were
two
but
the
finder
inadvertently
crushed
one
with
his
foot
before
he
saw
them
when
i
wrote
to
you
last
year
on
reptiles
i
wish
i
had
not
forgot
to
mention
the
faculty
that
snakes
have
of
stinking
se
defendendo
i
knew
a
gentleman
who
kept
a
tame
snake
which
was
in
its
person
as
sweet
as
any
animal
while
in
a
good
humour
and
unalarmed
but
as
soon
as
a
stranger
or
a
dog
or
cat
came
in
it
fell
to
hissing
and
filled
the
room
with
such
nauseous
effluvia
as
rendered
it
hardly
supportable
thus
the
squnck
or
stonck
of
ray
synop
ouadr
is
an
innocuous
and
sweet
animal
but
when
pressed
hard
by
dogs
and
men
it
can
eject
such
a
pestilent
and
fetid
smell
and
excrement
that
nothing
can
be
more
horrible
a
gentleman
sent
me
lately
a
fine
specimen
of
the
lanius
minor
cinerascens
cum
macula
in
scapulis
alba
raii
which
is
a
bird
that
at
the
time
of
your
publishing
your
two
first
volumes
of
british
zoology
i
find
you
had
not
seen
you
have
described
it
well
from
edwards
drawing
letter
xxvi
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
december
dear
sir
i
was
much
gratified
by
your
communicative
letter
on
your
return
from
scotland
where
you
spent
i
find
some
considerable
time
and
gave
yourself
good
room
to
examine
the
natural
curiosities
of
that
extensive
kingdom
both
those
of
the
islands
as
well
as
those
of
the
highlands
the
usual
bane
of
such
expeditions
is
hurry
because
men
seldom
allot
themselves
half
the
time
they
should
do
but
fixing
on
a
day
for
their
return
post
from
place
to
place
rather
as
if
they
were
on
a
journey
that
required
dispatch
than
as
philosophers
investigating
the
works
of
nature
you
must
have
made
no
doubt
many
discoveries
and
laid
up
a
good
fund
of
materials
for
a
future
edition
of
the
british
zoology
and
will
have
no
reason
to
repent
that
you
have
bestowed
so
much
pains
on
a
part
of
great
britain
that
perhaps
was
never
so
well
examined
before
it
has
always
been
matter
of
wonder
to
me
that
which
are
so
congenerous
to
thrushes
and
blackbirds
should
never
choose
to
breed
in
england
but
that
they
should
not
think
even
the
highlands
cold
and
northerly
and
sequestered
enough
is
a
circumstance
still
more
strange
and
wonderful
the
you
find
stays
in
scotland
the
whole
year
round
so
that
we
have
reason
to
conclude
that
those
migrators
that
visit
us
for
a
short
space
every
autumn
do
not
come
from
thence
and
here
i
think
will
be
the
proper
place
to
mention
that
those
birds
were
most
punctual
again
in
their
migration
this
autumn
appearing
as
before
about
the
of
september
but
their
flocks
were
larger
than
common
and
their
stay
protracted
somewhat
beyond
the
usual
time
if
they
came
to
spend
the
whole
winter
with
us
as
some
of
their
congeners
do
and
then
left
us
as
they
do
in
spring
i
should
not
be
so
much
struck
with
the
occurrence
since
it
would
be
similar
to
that
of
the
other
winter
birds
of
passage
but
when
i
see
them
for
a
fortnight
at
michaelmas
and
again
for
about
a
week
in
the
middle
of
april
i
am
seized
with
wonder
and
long
to
be
informed
whence
these
travellers
come
and
whither
they
go
since
they
seem
to
use
our
hills
merely
as
an
inn
or
baiting
place
your
account
of
the
greater
brambling
or
is
very
amusing
and
strange
it
is
that
such
a
bird
should
delight
in
such
perilous
voyages
over
the
northern
ocean
some
country
people
in
the
winter
time
have
every
now
and
then
told
me
that
they
have
seen
two
or
three
white
larks
on
our
downs
but
on
considering
the
matter
i
begin
to
suspect
that
these
are
some
stragglers
of
the
birds
we
are
talking
of
which
sometimes
perhaps
may
rove
so
far
to
the
southward
it
pleases
me
to
find
that
white
hares
are
so
frequent
on
the
scottish
mountains
and
especially
as
you
inform
me
that
it
is
a
distinct
species
for
the
quadrupeds
of
britain
are
so
few
that
every
new
species
is
a
great
acquisition
the
could
it
be
proved
to
belong
to
us
is
so
majestic
a
bird
that
it
would
grace
our
fauna
much
i
never
was
informed
before
where
are
known
to
breed
you
admit
i
find
that
i
have
proved
your
fen
salicaria
to
be
the
lesser
of
ray
and
i
think
that
you
may
be
secure
that
i
am
right
for
i
took
very
particular
pains
to
clear
up
that
matter
and
had
some
fair
specimens
but
as
they
were
not
well
preserved
they
are
decayed
already
you
will
no
doubt
insert
it
in
its
proper
place
in
your
next
edition
your
additional
plates
will
much
improve
your
work
de
buffon
i
know
has
described
the
water
but
still
i
am
pleased
to
find
you
have
discovered
it
in
lincolnshire
for
the
reason
i
have
given
in
the
article
on
the
white
hare
as
a
neighbour
was
lately
ploughing
in
a
dry
chalky
field
far
removed
from
any
water
he
turned
out
a
water
rat
that
was
curiously
laid
up
in
an
hybernaculum
artificially
formed
of
grass
and
leaves
at
one
end
of
the
burrow
lay
above
a
gallon
of
potatoes
regularly
stowed
on
which
it
was
to
have
supported
itself
for
the
winter
but
the
difficulty
with
me
is
how
this
amphibius
mus
came
to
fix
its
winter
station
at
such
a
distance
from
the
water
was
it
determined
in
its
choice
of
that
place
by
the
mere
accident
of
finding
the
potatoes
which
were
planted
there
or
is
it
the
constant
practice
of
the
aquatic
rat
to
forsake
the
neighbourhood
of
the
water
in
the
colder
months
though
i
delight
very
little
in
analogous
reasoning
knowing
how
fallacious
it
is
with
respect
to
natural
history
yet
in
the
following
instance
i
can
not
help
being
inclined
to
think
it
may
conduce
towards
the
explanation
of
a
difficulty
that
i
have
mentioned
before
with
respect
to
the
invariable
early
retreat
of
the
hirundo
apus
or
swift
so
many
weeks
before
its
congeners
and
that
not
only
with
us
but
also
in
andalusia
where
they
also
begin
to
retire
about
the
beginning
of
august
the
great
large
which
by
the
by
is
at
present
a
nondescript
in
england
and
what
i
have
never
been
able
yet
to
procure
retires
and
migrates
very
early
in
the
summer
it
also
ranges
very
high
for
its
food
feeding
in
a
different
region
of
the
air
and
that
is
the
reason
i
never
could
procure
one
now
this
is
exactly
the
case
with
the
swifts
for
they
take
their
food
in
a
more
exalted
region
than
the
other
species
and
are
very
seldom
seen
hawking
for
flies
near
the
ground
or
over
the
surface
of
the
water
from
hence
i
would
conclude
that
these
hirundines
and
the
larger
bats
are
supported
by
some
sorts
of
gnats
scarabs
or
phalaenae
that
are
of
short
continuance
and
that
the
short
stay
of
these
strangers
is
regulated
by
the
defect
of
their
food
the
little
bat
appears
almost
every
month
in
the
year
but
i
have
never
seen
the
large
ones
till
the
end
of
april
nor
after
july
they
are
most
common
in
june
but
never
in
any
plenty
are
a
rare
species
with
us
by
my
journal
it
appears
that
curlews
clamoured
on
to
october
the
since
which
i
have
not
seen
or
heard
any
swallows
were
observed
on
to
november
the
third
letter
xxvii
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
abound
in
my
gardens
and
fields
the
manner
in
which
they
eat
their
roots
of
the
plantain
in
my
is
very
curious
with
their
upper
mandible
which
is
much
longer
than
their
lower
they
bore
under
the
plant
and
so
eat
the
root
off
upwards
leaving
the
tuft
of
leaves
untouched
in
this
respect
they
are
serviceable
as
they
destroy
a
very
troublesome
weed
but
they
deface
the
waffles
in
some
measure
by
digging
little
round
holes
it
appears
by
the
dung
that
they
drop
upon
the
turf
that
beetles
are
no
inconsiderable
part
of
their
food
in
june
last
i
procured
a
litter
of
four
or
five
young
which
appeared
to
be
about
five
or
six
days
old
they
i
find
like
puppies
are
born
blind
and
could
not
see
when
they
came
to
my
hands
no
doubt
their
spines
are
soft
and
flexible
at
the
time
of
their
birth
or
else
the
poor
dam
would
have
but
a
bad
time
of
it
in
the
critical
moment
of
parturition
but
it
is
plain
that
they
soon
harden
for
these
little
pigs
had
such
stiff
prickles
on
their
backs
and
sides
as
would
easily
have
fetched
blood
had
they
not
been
handled
with
caution
their
spines
are
quite
white
at
this
age
and
they
have
little
hanging
ears
which
i
do
not
remember
to
be
discernible
in
the
old
ones
they
can
in
part
at
this
age
draw
their
skin
down
over
their
faces
but
are
not
able
to
contract
themselves
into
a
ball
as
they
do
for
the
sake
of
defence
when
full
grown
the
reason
i
suppose
is
because
the
curious
muscle
that
enables
the
creature
to
roll
itself
up
into
a
ball
was
not
then
arrived
at
its
full
tone
and
firmness
make
a
deep
and
warm
hybernaculum
with
leaves
and
moss
in
which
they
conceal
themselves
for
the
winter
but
i
never
could
find
that
they
stored
in
any
winter
provision
as
some
quadrupeds
certainly
do
i
have
discovered
an
anecdote
with
respect
to
the
turdus
pilaris
which
i
think
is
particular
enough
this
bird
though
it
sits
on
trees
in
the
and
procures
the
greatest
part
of
its
food
from
hedges
yea
moreover
builds
on
very
high
trees
as
may
be
seen
by
the
fauna
suecica
yet
always
appears
with
us
to
roost
on
the
ground
they
are
seen
to
come
in
flocks
just
before
it
is
dark
and
to
settle
and
nestle
among
the
heath
on
our
forest
and
besides
the
larkers
in
dragging
their
nets
by
night
frequently
catch
them
in
the
while
the
who
take
many
in
the
hedges
never
entangle
any
of
this
species
why
these
birds
in
the
matter
of
roosting
should
differ
from
all
their
congeners
and
from
themselves
also
with
respect
to
their
proceedings
by
day
is
a
fact
for
which
i
am
by
no
means
able
to
account
i
have
somewhat
to
inform
you
of
concerning
the
but
in
general
foreign
animals
fall
seldom
in
my
way
my
little
intelligence
is
confined
to
the
narrow
sphere
of
my
own
observations
at
home
letter
xxviii
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
march
on
i
managed
to
get
a
sight
of
the
female
moose
belonging
to
the
duke
of
richmond
at
goodwood
but
was
greatly
disappointed
when
i
arrived
at
the
spot
to
find
that
it
died
after
having
appeared
in
a
languishing
way
for
some
time
on
the
morning
before
however
understanding
that
it
was
not
stripped
i
proceeded
to
examine
this
rare
quadruped
i
found
it
in
an
old
slung
under
the
belly
and
chin
by
ropes
and
in
a
standing
posture
but
though
it
had
been
dead
for
so
short
a
time
it
was
in
so
putrid
a
state
that
the
stench
was
hardly
supportable
the
grand
distinction
between
this
deer
and
any
other
species
that
i
have
ever
met
with
consisted
in
the
strange
length
of
its
legs
on
which
it
was
tilted
up
much
in
the
manner
of
birds
of
the
grallae
order
i
measured
it
as
they
do
an
horse
and
found
that
from
the
ground
to
the
wither
it
was
just
five
feet
four
inches
which
height
answers
exactly
to
sixteen
hands
a
growth
that
few
horses
arrive
at
but
then
with
this
length
of
legs
its
neck
was
remarkably
short
no
more
than
twelve
inches
so
that
by
straddling
with
one
foot
forward
and
the
other
backward
it
grazed
on
the
plain
ground
with
the
greatest
difficulty
between
its
legs
the
ears
were
vast
and
lopping
and
as
long
as
the
neck
the
head
was
about
twenty
inches
long
and
and
had
such
a
redundancy
of
upper
lip
as
i
never
saw
before
with
huge
nostrils
this
lip
travellers
say
is
esteemed
a
dainty
dish
in
north
america
it
is
very
reasonable
to
suppose
that
this
creature
supports
itself
chiefly
by
browsing
of
trees
and
by
wading
after
towards
which
way
of
livelihood
the
length
of
leg
and
great
lip
must
contribute
much
i
have
read
somewhere
that
it
delights
in
eating
the
nymphaea
or
from
the
to
the
belly
behind
the
shoulder
it
measured
three
feet
and
eight
inches
the
length
of
the
legs
before
and
behind
consisted
a
great
deal
in
the
tibia
which
was
strangely
long
but
in
my
haste
to
get
out
of
the
stench
i
forgot
to
measure
that
joint
exactly
its
scut
seemed
to
be
about
an
inch
long
the
colour
was
a
grizzly
black
the
mane
about
four
inches
long
the
were
upright
and
shapely
the
hind
flat
and
splayed
the
spring
before
it
was
only
two
years
old
so
that
most
probably
it
was
not
then
come
to
its
growth
what
a
vast
tall
beast
must
a
grown
stag
be
i
have
been
told
some
arrive
at
ten
feet
and
an
half
this
poor
creature
had
at
first
a
female
companion
of
the
same
species
which
died
the
spring
before
in
the
same
garden
was
a
young
stag
or
red
deer
between
whom
and
this
moose
it
was
hoped
that
there
might
have
been
a
breed
but
their
inequality
of
height
must
have
always
been
a
bar
to
any
commerce
of
the
amorous
kind
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
examined
the
teeth
tongue
lips
hoofs
minutely
but
the
putrefaction
precluded
all
further
curiosity
this
animal
the
keeper
told
me
seemed
to
enjoy
itself
best
in
the
extreme
frost
of
the
former
winter
in
the
house
they
showed
me
the
horn
of
a
male
moose
which
had
no
but
only
a
broad
palm
with
some
snags
on
the
edge
the
noble
owner
of
the
dead
moose
proposed
to
make
a
skeleton
of
her
bones
please
to
let
me
hear
if
my
female
moose
corresponds
with
that
you
saw
and
whether
you
think
still
that
the
american
moose
and
european
elk
are
the
same
creature

am
with
the
greatest
esteem

letter

to
thomas

esquire

may
dear
sir
last
month
we
had
such
a
series
of
cold
turbulent
weather
such
a
constant
succession
of
frost
and
snow
and
hail
and
tempest
that
the
regular
migration
or
appearance
of
the
summer
birds
was
much
interrupted
some
did
not
show
themselves
at
least
were
not
heard
till
weeks
after
their
usual
time
as
the
and
throat
and
some
have
not
been
heard
yet
as
the
and
largest
as
to
the
i
have
not
seen
it
it
is
indeed
one
of
the
latest
but
should
appear
about
this
time
and
yet
amidst
all
this
meteorous
strife
and
war
of
the
elements
two
swallows
discovered
themselves
as
long
ago
as
the
eleventh
of
april
in
frost
and
snow
but
they
withdrew
quickly
and
were
not
visible
again
for
many
days
which
are
always
more
backward
than
swallows
were
not
observed
till
may
came
in
among
the
monogamous
birds
several
are
to
be
found
after
single
and
of
each
sex
but
whether
this
state
of
celibacy
is
matter
of
choice
or
necessity
is
not
so
easily
discoverable
when
the
deprive
my
martins
of
their
nests
as
soon
as
i
cause
one
to
be
shot
the
other
be
it
cock
or
hen
presently
procures
a
mate
and
so
for
several
times
following
i
have
known
a
infested
by
a
pair
of
white
owls
which
made
great
havoc
among
the
young
pigeons
one
of
the
owls
was
shot
as
soon
as
possible
but
the
survivor
readily
found
a
mate
and
the
mischief
went
on
after
some
time
the
new
pair
were
both
destroyed
and
the
annoyance
ceased
another
instance
i
remember
of
a
sportsman
whose
zeal
for
the
increase
of
his
game
being
greater
than
his
humanity
after
time
he
always
shot
the
of
every
couple
of
partridges
upon
his
grounds
supposing
that
the
rivalry
of
many
males
interrupted
the
breed
he
used
to
say
that
though
he
had
widowed
the
same
hen
several
times
yet
he
found
she
was
still
provided
with
a
fresh
paramour
that
did
not
take
her
away
from
her
usual
haunt
again
i
knew
a
lover
of
setting
an
old
sportsman
who
has
often
told
me
that
soon
after
harvest
he
has
frequently
taken
small
coveys
of
partridges
consisting
of
alone
these
he
pleasantly
used
to
call
old
bachelors
there
is
a
propensity
belonging
to
common
that
is
very
remarkable
i
mean
their
violent
fondness
for
fish
which
appears
to
be
their
most
favourite
food
and
yet
nature
in
this
instance
seems
to
have
planted
in
them
an
appetite
that
unassisted
they
know
not
how
to
gratify
for
of
all
quadrupeds
cats
are
the
least
disposed
towards
water
and
will
not
when
they
can
avoid
it
deign
to
wet
a
foot
much
less
to
plunge
into
that
element
quadrupeds
that
prey
on
fish
are
amphibious
such
is
the
otter
which
by
nature
is
so
well
formed
for
diving
that
it
makes
great
havoc
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
waters
not
supposing
that
we
had
any
of
those
beasts
in
our
shadow
brooks
i
was
much
pleased
to
see
a
male
otter
brought
to
me
weighing
pounds
that
had
been
shot
on
the
bank
of
our
stream

the
priory

think
in

strangely
prolix
in

what
linnaeus

how
do
you

long
to
see
it
i
forgot
to
mention
in
my
last
letter
and
had
not
room
to
insert
in
the
former
that
the
male
moose
in
rutting
time
swims
from
island
to
island
in
the
lakes
and
rivers
of
north
america
in
pursuit
of
the
females
my
friend
the
chaplain
saw
one
killed
in
the
water
as
it
was
on
that
errand
in
the
river
lawrence
it
was
a
monstrous
beast
he
told
me
but
he
did
not
take
the
dimensions
when
i
was
last
in
town
our
friend
barrington
most
obligingly
carried
me
to
see
many
curious
sights
as
you
were
then
writing
to
him
about
horns
he
carried
me
to
see
many
strange
and
wonderful
specimens
there
is
i
remember
at
lord
pembroke
at
wilton
an
horn
room
furnished
with
more
than
thirty
different
pairs
but
i
have
not
seen
that
house
lately
barrington
showed
me
many
astonishing
collections
of
stuffed
and
living
birds
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
after
i
had
studied
over
the
latter
for
a
time
i
remarked
that
every
species
almost
that
came
from
distant
regions
such
as
south
america
the
coast
of
guinea
were
birds
of
the
loxia
and
fringilla
genera
and
no
motacillae
or
muscicapae
were
to
be
met
with
when
i
came
to
consider
the
reason
was
obvious
enough
for
the
birds
subsist
on
seeds
which
are
easily
carried
on
board
while
the
birds
which
are
supported
by
worms
and
insects
or
what
is
a
succedaneum
for
them
fresh
raw
meat
can
meet
with
neither
in
long
and
tedious
voyages
it
is
from
this
defect
of
food
that
our
collections
curious
as
they
are
are
defective
and
we
are
deprived
of
some
of
the
most
delicate
and
lively
genera

am

find

their
native

are
farther
assured
that
they
continue
resident
in
those
cold

the

from
whence
then
do
our
migrate
so
regularly
every
september
and
make
their
appearance
again
as
if
in
their
return
every
april
they
are
more
early
this
year
than
common
for
some
were
seen
at
the
usual
hill
on
the
fourth
of
this
month
an
observing
devonshire
gentleman
tells
me
that
they
frequent
some
parts
of
dartmoor
and
breed
there
but
leave
those
haunts
about
the
end
of
september
or
beginning
of
october
and
return
again
about
the
end
of
march
another
intelligent
person
assures
me
that
they
breed
in
great
abundance
all
over
the
peak
of
derby
and
are
called
there
ousels
withdraw
in
october
and
november
and
return
in
spring
this
information
seems
to
throw
some
light
on
my
new
migration
scopoli
new
work
which
i
have
just
procured
has
its
merits
in
ascertaining
many
of
the
birds
of
the
tirol
and
carniola
monographers
come
from
whence
they
may
have
i
think
fair
presence
to
challenge
some
regard
and
approbation
from
the
lovers
of
natural
history
for
as
no
man
can
alone
investigate
all
the
works
of
nature
these
partial
writers
may
each
in
their
department
be
more
accurate
in
their
discoveries
and
freer
from
errors
than
more
general
writers
and
so
by
degrees
may
pave
the
way
to
an
universal
correct
natural
history
not
that
scopoli
is
so
circumstantial
and
attentive
to
the
life
and
conversation
of
his
birds
as
i
could
wish
he
advances
some
false
facts
as
when
he
says
of
the
hirundo
urbica
that
extra
nidum
non
nutrit
this
assertion
i
know
to
be
wrong
from
repeated
observations
this
summer
for
do
feed
their
young
flying
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
not
so
commonly
as
the
and
the
feat
is
done
in
so
quick
a
manner
as
not
to
be
perceptible
to
indifferent
observers
he
also
advances
some
i
was
going
to
say
improbable
facts
as
when
he
says
of
the
woodcock
that
rostra
portat
fugiens
ab
hoste
but
candour
forbids
me
to
say
absolutely
that
any
fact
is
false
because
i
have
never
been
witness
to
such
a
fact
i
have
only
to
remark
that
the
long
unwieldy
bill
of
the
woodcock
is
perhaps
the
worst
adapted
of
any
among
the
winged
creation
for
such
a
feat

to
suspect

very
well
with
the

when
he
comes
to
advance
that
it
is
hirundinis
urbicae
and
that
hirundinis
ripariae
linnaei
huic

he
in
some
measure
invalidates
all
he
has
said
at
least
he
shows
at
once
that
he
compares
them
to
these
species
merely
from
memory
for
i
have
compared
the
birds
themselves
and
find
they
differ
widely
in
every
circumstance
of
shape
size
and
colour
however
as
you
will
have
a
specimen
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
what
your
judgment
is
in
the
matter
whether
my
brother
is
forestalled
in
his
nondescript
or
not
he
will
have
the
credit
of
first
discovering
that
they
spend
their
winters
under
the
warm
and
sheltery
shores
of
gibraltar
and
barbary
scopoli
characters
of
his
ordines
and
genera
are
clear
just
and
expressive
and
much
in
the
spirit
of
linnaeus
these
few
remarks
are
the
result
of
my
first
perusal
of
scopoli
annus
primus
the
bane
of
our
science
is
the
comparing
one
animal
to
the
other
by
memory
for
want
of
caution
in
this
particular
scopoli
falls
into
errors
he
is
not
so
full
with
regard
to
the
manners
of
his
indigenous
birds
as
might
be
wished
as
you
justly
observe

letter
xxxiii
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
i
was
much
pleased
to
see
among
the
collection
of
birds
from
gibraltar
some
of
those
english
summer
birds
of
passage
concerning
whose
departure
we
have
made
so
much
inquiry
now
if
these
birds
are
found
in
andalusia
to
migrate
to
and
from
barbary
it
may
easily
be
supposed
that
those
that
come
to
us
may
migrate
back
to
the
continent
and
spend
their
winters
in
some
of
the
warmer
parts
of
europe
this
is
certain
that
many
birds
that
come
to
gibraltar
appear
there
only
in
spring
and
autumn
seeming
to
advance
in
pairs
towards
the
northward
for
the
sake
of
breeding
during
the
summer
months
and
retiring
in
parties
and
broods
towards
the
south
at
the
decline
of
the
year
so
that
the
rock
of
gibraltar
is
the
great
rendezvous
and
place
of
observation
from
whence
they
take
their
departure
each
way
towards
europe
or
africa
it
is
therefore
no
mean
discovery
i
think
to
find
that
our
small
summer
birds
of
passage
are
to
be
seen
spring
and
autumn
on
the
very
skirts
of
europe
it
is
a
presumptive
proof
of
their
emigrations
scopoli
seems
to
me
to
have
found
the
hirundo
melba
the
great
gibraltar
swift
in
tirol
without
knowing
it
for
what
is
his
hirundo
alpina
but
the
bird
in
other
words
says
he
prioris
meaning
the
swift
pectus
album
paulo
major
priore
i
do
not
suppose
this
to
be
a
new
species
it
is
true
also
of
the
melba
that
in

curlew
oedicnemus
sends
me
the
following
account
looking
over
my
naturalist
journal
for
the
month
of
april
i
find
the
stone
curlews
are
first
mentioned
on
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
which
date
seems
to
me
rather
late
they
live
with
us
all
the
spring
and
summer
and
at
the
beginning
of
autumn
prepare
to
take
leave
by
getting
together
in
flocks
they
seem
to
me
a
bird
of
passage
that
may
travel
into
some
dry
hilly
country
south
of
us
probably
spain
because
of
the
abundance
of
in
that
country
for
they
spend
their
summers
with
us
in
such
districts
this
conjecture
i
hazard
as
i
have
never
met
with
any
one
that
has
seen
them
in
england
in
the
winter
i
believe
they
are
not
fond
of
going
near
the
water
but
feed
on
that
are
common
on
and
downs
they
breed
on
fallows
and
abounding
with
grey
mossy
flints
which
much
resemble
their
young
in
colour
among
which
they
skulk
and
conceal
themselves
they
make
no
nest
but
lay
their
eggs
on
the
bare
ground
producing
in
common
but
two
at
a
time
there
is
reason
to
think
their
young
run
soon
after
they
are
hatched
and
that
the
old
ones
do
not
feed
them
but
only
lead
them
about
at
the
time
of
feeding
which
for
the
most
part
is
in
the
night
thus
far
my
friend
in
the
manners
of
this
bird
you
see
there
is
something
very
analogous
to
the
bustard
whom
it
also
somewhat
resembles
in
aspect
and
make
and
in
the
structure
of
its
feet
for
a
long
time
i
have
desired
my
relation
to
look
out
for
these
birds
in
andalusia
and
now
he
writes
me
word
that
for
the
first
time
he
saw
one
dead
in

of

getting
into

some
have
assured
me
are
much
infested
by
them
on
chalky

where
these

swarm
sometimes

so
infinite

as
to
discolour
their

to
give

this

to

a
variety
of
the

wants
to
be

the
country
people
here
call
it
the

i
know
it
to

as
you
walk
in

field
or
in
a
garden
make
a
pattering
like
rain
by
jumping
on
the
leaves
of
the
turnips
or
cabbages
there
is
an
oestrus
known
in
these
parts
to
every
ploughboy
which
because
it
is
omitted
by
linnaeus
is
also
passed
over
by
late
writers
and
that
is
the
curvicauda
of
old
moufet
mentioned
by
derham

dexterous
a
manner

then
derham
is
mistaken
when
he
advances
that
this
oestrus
is
the
parent
of
that
wonderful
maggot
which
he
mentions
afterwards
for
more

what

more
than
some

should

express
the
generic
distinctions
of
insects
according
to
linnaeus

i
am
well
assured
that

would
study
insects

they
set
out
with
a

letter

pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
happening
to
make
a
visit
to
my
neighbour
peacocks
i
could
not
help
observing
that
the
trains
of
those
magnificent
birds
appear
by
no
means
to
be
their
tails
those
long
feathers
growing
not
from
their
uropygium
but
all
up
their
backs
a
range
of
short
brown
stiff
feathers
about
six
inches
long
fixed
in
the
uropygium
is
the
real
tail
and
serves
as
the
fulcrum
to
prop
the
train
which
is
long
and
when
set
on
end
when
the
train
is
up
nothing
appears
of
the
bird
before
but
its
head
and
neck
but
this
would
not
be
the
case
were
those
long
feathers
fixed
only
in
the
rump
as
may
be
seen
by
the
when
in
a
strutting
attitude
by
a
strong
muscular
vibration
these
birds
can
make
the
shafts
of
their
long
feathers
clatter
like
the
swords
of
a
they
then
trample
very
quick
with
their
feet
and
run
backwards
towards
the
females
i
should
tell
you
that
i
have
got
an
uncommon
calculus
aegogropila
taken
out
of
the
stomach
of
a
fat
ox
it
is
perfectly
round
and
about
the
size
of
a
large
seville
orange
such
are
i
think
usually
flat
letter
xxxvi
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
dear
sir
the
summer
through
i
have
seen
but
two
of
that
large
species
of
bat
which
i
call
vespertilio
altivolans
from
its
manner
of
feeding
high
in
the
air
i
procured
one
of
them
and
found
it
to
be
a
male
and
made
no
doubt
as
they
accompanied
together
that
the
other
was
a
female
but
happening
in
an
evening
or
two
to
procure
the
other
likewise
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
when
it
appeared
to
be
also
of
the
same
sex
this
circumstance
and
the
great
scarcity
of
this
sort
at
least
in
these
parts
occasions
some
suspicions
in
my
mind
whether
it
is
really
a
species
or
whether
it
may
not
be
the
male
part
of
the
more
known
species
one
of
which
may
supply
many
females
as
is
known
to
be
the
case
in
sheep
and
some
other
quadrupeds
but
this
doubt
can
only
be
cleared
by
a
farther
examination
and
some
attention
to
the
sex
of
more
specimens
all
that
i
know
at
present
is
that
my
two
were
amply
furnished
with
the
parts
of
generation
much
resembling
those
of
a
boar
in
the
extent
of
their
wings
they
measured
fourteen
inches
and
an
half
and
four
inches
and
an
half
from
the
nose
to
the
tip
of
the
tail
their
heads
were
large
their
nostrils
bilobated
their
shoulders
broad
and
muscular
and
their
whole
bodies
fleshy
and
plump
nothing
could
be
more
sleek
and
soft
than
their
fur
which
was
of
a
bright
chestnut
colour
their
maws
were
full
of
food
but
so
macerated
that
the
quality
could
not
be
distinguished
their
livers
kidneys
and
hearts
were
large
and
their
bowels
covered
with
fat
they
weighed
each
when
entire
full
one
ounce
and
one
drachm
within
the
ear
there
was
somewhat
of
a
peculiar
structure
that
i
did
not
understand
perfectly
but
refer
it
to
the
observation
of
the
curious
anatomist

letter

to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
on
the
twelfth
of
july
i
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
contemplating
the
motions
of
the
caprimulgus
or
as
it
was
playing
round
a
large
oak
that
swarmed
with
scarabaei
solstitiales
or
the
powers
of
its
wing
were
wonderful
exceeding
if
possible
the
various
evolutions
and
quick
turns
of
the
swallow
genus
but
the
circumstance
that
pleased
me
most
was
that
i
saw
it
distinctly
more
than
once
put
out
its
short
leg
while
on
the
wing
and
by
a
bend
of
the
head
deliver
somewhat
into
its
mouth
if
it
takes
any
part
of
its
prey
with
its
foot
as
i
have
now
the
greatest
reason
to
suppose
it
does
these

i
no
longer
wonder
at
the
use
of
its

taken
up

at

of
the

march
dear
sir
by
my
journal
for
last
autumn
it
appears
that
the
bred
very
late
and
staid
very
late
in
these
parts
for
on
the
first
of
october
i
saw
young
martins
in
their
nests
nearly
fledged
and
again
on
the
of
october
we
had
at
the
next
house
a
nest
full
of
young
martins
just
ready
to
fly
and
the
old
ones
were
hawking
for
insects
with
great
alertness
the
next
morning
the
brood
forsook
their
nest
and
were
flying
round
the
village
from
this
day
i
never
saw
one
of
the
swallow
kind
till
november
the
third
when
twenty
or
perhaps
thirty
were
playing
all
day
long
by
the
side
of
the
hanging
wood
and
over
my
fields
did
these
small
weak
birds
some
of
which
were
nestlings
twelve
days
ago
shift
their
quarters
at
this
late
season
of
the
year
to
the
other
side
of
the
northern
tropic
or
rather
is
it
not
more
probable
that
the
next
church
ruin
steep
covert
or
perhaps
sandbank
lake
or
pool
as
a
more
northern
naturalist
would
say
may
become
their
hybernaculum
and
afford
them
a
ready
and
obvious
retreat
we
now
begin
to
expect
our
vernal
migration
of
every
week
persons
worthy
of
credit
assure
me
that
were
seen
at
christmas
in
the
forest
of
bere
on
the
southern
verge
of
this
county
hence
we
may
conclude
that
their
migrations
are
only
internal
and
not
extended
to
the
continent
southward
if
they
do
at
first
come
at
all
from
the
northern
parts
of
this
island
only
and
not
from
the
north
of
europe
come
from
whence
they
will
it
is
plain
from
the
fearless
disregard
that
they
show
for
men
or
guns
that
they
have
been
little
accustomed
to
places
of
much
resort
navigators
mention
that
in
the
isle
of
ascension
and
other
such
desolate
districts
birds
are
so
little
acquainted
with
the
human
form
that
they
settle
on
men
shoulders
and
have
no
more
dread
of
a
sailor
than
they
would
have
of
a
goat
that
was
grazing
a
young
man
at
lewes

me
that
about
seven
years
ago
abounded
so
about
that
town
in
the
autumn
that
he
killed
sixteen
himself
in
one
afternoon
he
added
farther
that
some
had
appeared
since
in
every
autumn
but
he
could
not
find
that
any
had
been
observed
before
the
season
in
which
he
shot

i
myself
have
found
these

letter

to

pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
as
you
desire
me
to
send
you
such
observations
as
may
occur
i
take
the
liberty
of
making
the
following
remarks
that
you
may
according
as
you
think
me
right
or
wrong
admit
or
reject
what
i
here
advance
in
your
intended
new
edition
of
the
british
zoology
the
osprey
was
shot
about
a
year
ago
at
frinshampond
a
great
lake
at
about
six
miles
from
hence
while
it
was
sitting
on
the
handle
of
a
plough
and
devouring
a
fish
it
used
to
precipitate
itself
into
the
water
and
so
take
its
prey
by
surprise
a
great
was
shot
last
winter
in
park
and
a
at
selborne

cornish
choughs

and

on
all
the
cliffs
of
the
sussex
coast
the
common
or
is
a
bird
of
passage
in
the
south
of
england
seldom
appearing
till
towards
the
end
of
november
is
usually
the
latest
winter
bird
of
passage
before
our
beechen
woods
were
so
much
destroyed
we
had
myriads
of
them
reaching
in
strings
for
a
mile
together
as
they
went
out
in
a
morning
to
feed
they
leave
us
early
in
spring
where
do
they
breed
the
people
of
hampshire
and
sussex
call

it
sings
early
in
the
spring
in
blowing
showery
weather
its
song
often
commences
with
the
year
with
us
it
builds
much
in
orchards
a
gentleman
assures
me
that
he
has
taken
the
nests
of
on
dartmoor
they
build
in
banks
on
the
sides
of
streams
titlarks
not
only
sing
sweetly
as
they
sit
on
trees
but
also
as
they
play
and
toy
about
on
the
wing
and
particularly
while
they
are
descending
and
sometimes
as
they
stand
on
the
ground
adamson
testimony
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
poor
evidence
that
european
swallows
migrate
during
our
winter
to
senegal
he
does
not
talk
at
all
like
an
ornithologist
and
probably
saw
only
the
swallows
of
that
country
which
i
know
build
within
governor
hall
against
the
roof
had
he
known
european
swallows
would
he
not
have
mentioned
the
species
the
washes
by
dropping
into
the
water
as
it
flies
this
species
appears
commonly
about
a
week
before
the
martin
and
about
ten
or
twelve
days
before
the
swift
in
there
were
young
in
their
nest
till
october
the
the
swift
appears
about
ten
or
twelve
days
later
than
the
swallow
about
the
or
of
april
and
stay
with
us
the
whole
year
some
continue
with
us
the
winter
through
wagtails
all
sorts
remain
with
us
all
the
winter
bullfinches
when
fed
on
hempseed
often
become
wholly
black
we
have
vast
flocks
of
female
chaffinches
all
the
winter
with
hardly
any
males
among
them
when
you
say
that
in
the
make
a
bleating
noise
and
i
a
drumming
perhaps
i
should
have
rather
said
an
humming
i
suspect
we
mean
the
same
thing
however
while
they
are
playing
about
on
the
wing
they
certainly
make
a
loud
piping
with
their
mouths
but
whether
that
bleating
or
humming
is
ventriloquous
or
proceeds
from
the
motion
of
their
wings
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
that
when
this
noise
happens
the
bird
is
always
descending
and
his
wings
are
violently
agitated
soon
after
the
lapwings
have
done
breeding
they
congregate
and
leaving
the
moors
and
marshes
betake
themselves
to
downs
and
two
years
ago
last
spring
the
little
auk
was
found
alive
and
unhurt
but
fluttering
and
unable
to
rise
in
a
lane
a
few
miles
from
alresford
where
there
is

it
was
kept
a

this

be
peculiar

to
say
it

most

notes
are
hurrying

not
unpleasing

imitative
of

slumbers
sometimes

soon

is
awakened
it
reassumes
its
song
letter
xl
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
selborne
dear
sir
before
your
letter
arrived
and
of
my
own
accord
i
had
been
remarking
and
comparing
the
tails
of
the
male
and
female
swallow
and
this
ere
any
young
broods
appeared
so
that
there
was
no
danger
of
confounding
the
dams
with
their
pulli
and
besides
as
they
were
then
always
in
pairs
and
busied
in
the
employ
of
nidification
there
could
be
no
room
for
mistaking
the
sexes
nor
the
individuals
of
different
chimneys
the
one
for
the
other
from
all
my
observations
it
constantly
appeared
that
each
sex
has
the
long
feathers
in
its
tail
that
give
it
that
forked
shape
with
this
difference
that
they
are
longer
in
the
tail
of
the
male
than
in
that
of
the
female
nightingales

their
young
first

abroad

a
plaintive
and
a
jarring
noise
and
also
a
snapping

cracking

the
kestrel
in

supposed
to
be
two
sorts
of
eels
in
the
island
of
ely
the
threads
sometimes
discovered
in
eels
are
perhaps
their
young
the
generation
of
eels
is
very
dark
and
mysterious
breed
on
the
ground
and
seem
never
to
settle
on
trees
when
shake
their
tails
they
move
them
horizontally
as
dogs
do
when
they
fawn
the
tail
of
a
wagtail
when
in
motion
bobs
up
and
down
like
that
of
a
jaded
horse
have
a
remarkable
flirt
with
their
wings
in
as
soon
as
frosty
mornings
come
they
make
a
very
piping
plaintive
noise
many
birds
which
become
silent
about
midsummer
reassume
their
notes
again
in
september
as
the
thrush
blackbird
woodlark
etc
hence
august
is
by
much
the
most
mute
month
the
spring
summer
and
autumn
through
are
birds
induced
to
sing
again
because
the
temperament
of
autumn
resembles
that
of
spring
linnaeus
ranges
plants
geographically
palms
inhabit
the
tropics
grasses
the
temperate
zones
and
mosses
and
lichens
the
polar
circles
no
doubt
animals
may
be
classed
in
the
same
manner
with
propriety
build
under
eaves
in
the
spring
as
the
weather
becomes
hotter
they
get
out
for
coolness
and
nest
in
and
these
birds
have
been
known
sometimes
to
build
in
rooks
nests
and
sometimes
in
the
forks
of
boughs
under
nests
as
my
neighbour
was
housing
a
rick
he
observed
that
his
dogs
devoured
all
the
little
red
mice
that
they
could
catch
but
rejected
the
common
mice
and
that
his
cats
ate
the
common
mice
refusing
the
red
sing
all
through
the
spring
summer
and
autumn
the
reason
that
they
are
called
autumn
songsters
is
because
in
the
two
first
seasons
their
voices
are
drowned
and
lost
in
the
general
chorus
in
the
latter
their
song
becomes
distinguishable
many
songsters
of
the
autumn
seem
to
be
the
young
cock
of
that
year
notwithstanding
the
prejudices
in
their
favour
they
do
much
mischief
in
gardens
to
the
they
eat
also
the
berries
of
the
ivy
the
honeysuckle
and
the
euonymus
europaeus
or
the
titmouse
which
early
in
february
begins
to
make
two
quaint
notes
like
the
whetting
of
a
saw
is
the
marsh
titmouse
the
great
titmouse
sings
with
three
cheerful
joyous
notes
and
begins
about
the
same
time
wrens
sing
all
the
winter
through
frost
excepted
came
remarkably
late
this
year
both
in
hampshire
and
devonshire
is
this
circumstance
for
or
against
either
hiding
or
migration
most
birds
drink
sipping
at
intervals
but
pigeons
take
a
long
continued
draught
like
quadrupeds
notwithstanding
what
i
have
said
in
a
former
letter
no
grey
crows
were
ever
known
to
breed
on
dartmoor
it
was
my
mistake
the
appearance
and
flying
of
the
scarabaeus
solstitialis
or
chafer
commence
with
the
month
of
july
and
cease
about
the
end
of
it
these
scarabs
are
the
constant
food
of
caprimulgi
or
owls
through
that
period
they
abound
on
the
chalky
downs
and
in
some
sandy
districts
but
not
in
the
clays
in
the
garden
of
the
inn
in
the
town
of
reading
is
a
stream
or
canal
running
under
the
stables
and
out
into
the
fields
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
in
this
water
are
many
carps
which
lie
rolling
about
in
sight
being
fed
by
travellers
who
amuse
themselves
by
tossing
them
bread
but
as
soon
as
the
weather
grows
at
all
severe
these
fishes
are
no
longer
seen
because
they
retire
under
the
stables
where
they
remain
till
the
return
of
spring
do
they
lie
in
a
torpid
state
if
they
do
not
how
are
they
supported
the
note
of
the
which
is
continually
repeated
and
often
attended
with
odd
gesticulations
on
the
wing
is
harsh
and
displeasing
these
birds
seem
of
a
pugnacious
disposition
for
they
sing
with
an
erected
crest
and
attitudes
of
rivalry
and
defiance
are
shy
and
wild
in
avoiding
neighbourhoods
and
haunting
lonely
lanes
and
commons
nay
even
the
very
tops
of
the
where
there
are
bushes
and
covert
but
in
july
and
august
they
bring
their
broods
into
gardens
and
orchards
and
make
great
havoc
among
the
the
has
in
common
a
full
sweet
deep
loud
and
wild
pipe
yet
that
strain
is
of
short
continuance
and
his
motions
are
desultory
but
when
that
bird
sits
calmly
and
engages
in
song
in
earnest
he
pours
forth
very
sweet
but
inward
melody
and
expresses
great
variety
of
soft
and
gentle
modulations
superior
perhaps
to
those
of
any
of
our
warblers
the
nightingale
excepted
mostly
haunt
orchards
and
gardens
while
they
warble
their
throats
are
wonderfully
distended
the
song
of
the
is
superior
though
somewhat
like
that
of
the
some
birds
have
a
few
more
notes
than
others
sitting
very
placidly
on
the
top
of
a
tree
in
a
village
the
cock
sings
from
morning
to
night
he
affects
neighbourhoods
and
avoids
solitude
and
loves
to
build
in
orchards
and
about
houses
with
us
he
perches
on
the
vane
of
a
tall
maypole
the
is
of
all
our
summer
birds
the
most
mute
and
the
most
familiar
it
also
appears
the
last
of
any
it
builds
in
a
vine
or
a
sweetbriar
against
the
wall
of
an
house
or
in
the
hole
of
a
wall
or
on
the
end
of

or
plate
and
often
close
to
the
post
of
a
door
where
people
are
going
in
and
out
all
day
long
this
bird
does
not
make
the
least
pretension
to
song
but
uses
a
little
inward
wailing
note
when
it
thinks
its
young
in
danger
from
cats
or
other
annoyances

that

on
a
retrospect
i
observe
that
my
long
letter
carries
with
it
a
quaint
and
magisterial
air
and
is
very
sententious
but
when
i
recollect
that
you
requested
stricture
and
anecdote
i
hope
you
will
pardon
the
didactic
manner
for
the
sake
of
the
information
it
may
happen
to
contain
letter
xli
to
thomas
pennant
esquire
it
is
matter
of
curious
inquiry
to
trace
out
how
those
species
of
birds
that
continue
with
us
the
winter
through
subsist
during
the
dead
months
the
imbecility
of
birds
seems
not
to
be
the
only
reason
why
they
shun
the
rigour
of
our
winters
for
the
robust
wryneck
so
much
resembling
the
hardy
race
of
migrates
while
the
feeble
little
wren
that
shadow
of
a
bird
braves
our
severest
frosts
without
availing
himself
of
houses
or
villages
to
which
most
of
our
winter
birds
crowd
in
distressful
seasons
while
this
keeps
aloof
in
fields
and
woods
but
perhaps
this
may
be
the
reason
why
they
may
often
perish
and
why
they
are
almost
as
rare
as
any
bird
we
know
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
but
that
the
birds
which
winter
with
us
subsist
chiefly
on
insects
in
their
aurelia
state
all
the
species
of
wagtails
in
severe
weather
haunt
shallow
streams
near
their
where
they
never
freeze
and
by
wading
pick
out
the
aurelias
of
the
genus
of
phryganeae
etc
see
derham
p
frequent
sinks
and
gutters
in
hard
weather
where
they
pick
up
crumbs
and
other
sweepings
and
in
mild
weather
they
procure
worms
which
are
stirring
every
month
in
the
year
as
any
one
may
see
that
will
only
be
at
the
trouble
of
taking
a
candle
to
a
on
any
mild
winter
night
and
wrens
in
the
winter
haunt
stables
and
barns
where
they
find
spiders
and
flies
that
have
laid
themselves
up
during
the
cold
season
but
the
grand
support
of
the
birds
in
winter
is
that
infinite
profusion
of
aureliae
of
the
lepidoptera
ordo
which
is
fastened
to
the
twigs
of
trees
and
their
trunks
to
the
pales
and
walls
of
gardens
and
buildings
and
is
found
in
every
cranny
and
cleft
of
rock
or
rubbish
and
even
in
the
ground
itself
every
species
of
titmouse
winters
with
us
they
have
what
i
call
a
kind
of
intermediate
bill
between
the
hard
and
the
soft
between
the
linnaean
genera
of
fringilla
and
motacilla
one
species
alone
spends
its
whole
time
in
the
woods
and
fields
never
retreating
for
succour
in
the
severest
seasons
to
houses
and
neighbourhoods
and
that
is
the
delicate
titmouse
which
is
almost
as
minute
as
the
wren

frequents

admiration
draw
straw
lengthwise
from
out
the
eaves

order
to
pull
out
the
flies
that
were
concealed
between
them
and
that
in
such
numbers
that
they
quite
defaced
the
thatch
and
gave
it
a
ragged
appearance
the
blue
titmouse
or
nun
is
a
great
frequenter
of
houses
and
a
general
devourer
beside
insects

very
fond

probably
it
is
that

arises

extend

a
new

a
country
little
known
to
the
naturalist
he
will
not
it
is
to
be
wished
undertake
that
tour
unaccompanied
by
a
botanist
because
the
mountains
have
scarcely
been
sufficiently
examined
and
the
southerly
counties
of
so
mild
an
island
may
possibly
afford
some
plants
little
to
be
expected
within
the
british
dominions
a
person
of
a
thinking
turn
of
mind
will
draw
many
just
remarks
from
the
modern
improvements
of
that
country
both
in
arts
and
agriculture
where
premiums
obtained
long
before
they
were
heard
of
with
us
the
manners
of
the
wild
natives
their
superstitions
their
prejudices
their
sordid
way
of
life
will
extort
from
him
many
useful
reflections
he
should
also
take
with
him

must
by
no

pass
over
the
noble
castles

the
extensive

picturesque

the
lofty
stupendous
mountains

little
known

so
engaging

any

this

defective
the
great
obvious
defect
that
i
have
remarked
in
all

fallen
in

a
want

country

well
distinguished

great

not
be
passed
over

notice

i
am
much
of
your

and
see
no
reason
for
making
it
the

of
the

suppose
those
that
have
advanced
that
opinion
may
have
been
misled
by
another
appellation
often
given
to
the

is
that
of
unless
the

varies
greatly
in

from
itself

seems
more
unlikely
to
be
domesticated

to
make

very
rarely
see

beeches
could
it
be
known
in
what
manner
build
the
doubt
would
be
settled
with
me
at
once
provided
they
construct
their
nests
on
trees
like
the
as
i
much
suspect
they
do
you
received
you
say
last
spring
a
from
sussex
and
are
informed
that
they
sometimes
breed
in
that
county
but
why
did
not
your
correspondent
determine
the
place
of
its
nidification
whether
on
rocks
cliffs
or
trees
if
he
was
not
an
adroit
ornithologist
i
should
doubt
the
fact
because
people
with
us
perpetually
confound
the
with
the
for
my
own
part
i
readily
concur
with
you
in
supposing
that
are
derived
from
the
small
blue
for
many
reasons
in
the
first
place
the
wild
is
manifestly
larger
than
the
common
against
the
usual
rule
of
domestication
which
generally
enlarges
the
breed
again
these
two
remarkable
black
spots
on
the
remiges
of
each
wing
of
the
which
are
so
characteristic
of
the
species
would
not
one
should
think
be
totally
lost
by
its
being
reclaimed
but
would
often
break
out
among
its
descendants
but
what
is
worth
an
hundred
arguments
is
the
instance
you
give
in
sir
roger
in
caernarvonshire
which
though
tempted
by
plenty
of
food
and
gentle
treatment
can
never
be
prevailed
on
to
inhabit
their
cote
for
any
time
but
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
breed
betake
themselves
to
the
fastnesses
of
ormshead
and
deposit
their
young
in
safety
amidst
the
inaccessible
caverns
and
precipices
of
that
stupendous
promontory
naturam
expellas
furca
tamen
usque
recurret
i
have
consulted
a
sportsman
now
in
his
year
who
tells
me
that
fifty
or
sixty
years
back
when
the
beechen
woods
were
much
more
extensive
than
at
present
the
number
of
pigeons
was
astonishing
that
he
has
often
killed
near
twenty
in
a
day
and
that
with
a
long
wildfowl
piece
he
has
shot
seven
or
eight
at
a
time
on
the
wing
as
they
came
wheeling
over
his
head
he
moreover
adds
which
i
was
not
aware
of
that
often
there
were
among
them
little
parties
of
small
blue
doves
which
he
calls
rockiers
the
food
of
these
numberless
emigrants
was
and
some
acorns
and
particularly
barley
which
they
collected
in
the
stubbles
but
of
late
years
since
the
vast
increase
of
turnips
that
vegetable
has
furnished
a
great
part
of
their
support
in
hard
weather
and
the
holes
they
pick
in
these
roots
greatly
damage
the
crop
from
this
food
their
flesh
has
contracted
a
rancidness
which
occasions
them
to
be
rejected
by
nicer
judges
of
eating
who
thought
them
before
a
delicate
dish
they
were
shot
not
only
as
they
were
feeding
in
the
fields
and
especially
in
snowy
weather
but
also
at
the
close
of
the
evening
by
men
who
lay
in
ambush
among
the
woods
and
groves
to
kill
them
as
they
came
in
to
roost
these
are
the
principal
circumstances
relating
to
this
wonderful
internal
migration
which
with
us
takes
place
towards
the
end
of
november
and
ceases
early
in
the
spring
last
winter
we
had
in
selborne
high
wood
about
an
hundred
of
these
doves
but
in
former
times
the
flocks
were
so
vast
not
only
with
us
but
all
the
district
round
that
on
mornings
and
evenings
they
traversed
the
air
like
rooks
in
strings
reaching
for
a
mile
together
when
they
thus
rendezvoused
here
by
thousands
if
they
happened
to
be
suddenly
roused
from
their
on
an
evening
their
rising
all
at
once
was
like
the
sound
of
thunder
heard
remote
some
old
sportsmen
say
that
the
main
part
of
these
flocks
used
to
withdraw
as
soon
as
the
heavy
christmas
frosts
were
over
it
will
by
no
means
be
foreign
to
the
present
purpose
to
add
that
i
had
a
relation
in
this
neighbourhood
who
made
it
a
practice
for
a
time
whenever
he
could
procure
the
eggs
of
a
to
place
them
under
a
pair
of
doves
that
were
sitting
in
his
own
house
hoping
thereby
if
he
could
bring
about
a
coalition
to
enlarge
his
breed
and
teach
his
own
doves
to
beat
out
into
the
woods
and
to
support
themselves
by
mast
the
plan
was
plausible
but
something
always
interrupted
the
success
for
though
the
birds
were
usually
hatched
and
sometimes
grew
to
half
their
size
yet
none
ever
arrived
at
maturity
i
myself
have
seen
these
foundlings
in
their
nest
displaying
a
strange
ferocity
of
nature
so
as
scarcely
to
bear
to
be
looked
at
and
snapping
with
their
bills
by
way
of
menace
in
short
they
always
died
perhaps
for
want
of
proper
sustenance
but
the
owner
thought
that
by
their
fierce
and
wild
demeanour
they
frighted
their
and
so
were
starved
virgil
as
a
familiar
occurrence
by
way
of
simile
describes
a
dove
haunting
the
cavern
of
a
rock
in
such
engaging
numbers
that
i
can
not
refrain
from
quoting
the
passage
and
john
dryden
has
rendered
it
so
happily
in
our
language
that
without
farther
excuse
i
shall
add
his
translation

where

dear
sir
it
was
no

matter
of
satisfaction
to
me
to
find
that
you
were
not
displeased
with
my
little
methodus
of
birds
if
there
was
any
merit
in
the
sketch
it
must
be
owing
to
its
punctually
for
many
months
i
carried
a
list
in
my
pocket
of
the
birds
that
were
to
be
remarked
and
as
i
rode
or
walked
about
my
business
i
noted
each
day
the
continuance
or
omission
of
each
bird
song
so
that
i
am
as
sure
of
the
certainty
of
my
facts
as
a
man
can
be
of
any
transaction
whatsoever
i
shall
now
proceed
to
answer
the
several
queries
which
you
put
in
your
two
obliging
letters
in
the
best
manner
that
i
am
able
perhaps
eastwick
and
its
environs
where
you
heard
so
very
few
birds
is
not
a
woodland
country
and
therefore
not
stocked
with
such
songsters
if
you
will
cast
your
eye
on
my
last
letter
you
will
find
that
many
species
continued
to
warble
after
the
beginning
of
july
the
titlark
and
yellowhammer
breed
late
the
latter
very
late
and
therefore
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
protract
their
song
for
i
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
in
ornithology
that
as
long
as
there
is
any
incubation
going
on
there
is
music
as
to
the
and
wren
it
is
well
known
to
the
most
incurious
observer
that
they
whistle
the
year
round
hard
frost
excepted
especially
the
latter
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
procure
you
a
or
a
less
sparrow
or
alive
as
the
first
is
undoubtedly
and
the
last
as
far
as
i
can
yet
see
a
summer
bird
of
passage
they
would
require
more
nice
and
curious
management
in
a
cage
than
i
should
be
able
to
give
them
they
are
both
distinguished
songsters
the
note
of
the
former
has
such
a
wild
sweetness
that
it
always
brings
to
my
mind
those
lines
in
a
song
in
as
you
like
it
and
tune
his
merry
note
unto
the
wild
bird
the
latter
has
a
surprising
variety
of
notes
resembling
the
song
of
several
other
birds
but
then
it
also
has
an
hurrying
manner
not
at
all
to
its
advantage
it
is
notwithstanding
a
delicate
polyglot
it
is
new
to
me
that
titlarks
in
cages
sing
in
the
night
perhaps
only
caged
birds
do
so
i
once
knew
a
tame
in
a
cage
that
always
sang
as
long
as
candles
were
in
the
room
but
in
their
wild
state
no
one
supposes
they
sing
in
the
night
i
should
be
almost
ready
to
doubt
the
fact
that
there
are
to
be
seen
much
fewer
birds
in
july
than
in
any
former
month
notwithstanding
so
many
young
are
hatched
daily
sure
i
am
that
it
is
far
otherwise
with
respect
to
the
swallow
tribe
which
increases
prodigiously
as
the
summer
advances
and
i
saw
at
the
time
mentioned
many
hundreds
of
young
wagtails
on
the
banks
of
the
cherwell
which
almost
covered
the
meadows
if
the
matter
appears
as
you
say
in
the
other
species
may
it
not
be
owing
to
the
dams
being
engaged
in
incubation
while
the
young
are
concealed
by
the
leaves
many
times
have
i
had
the
curiosity
to
open
the
stomachs
of
woodcocks
and
snipes
but
nothing
ever
occurred
that
helped
to
explain
to
me
what
their
subsistence
might
be
all
that
i
could
ever
find

a
soft
mucus

which
lay
many
pellucid

dear
sir
your
observation
that
cuckoo
does
not
deposit
its
egg
indiscriminately
in
the
nest
of
the
first
bird
that
comes
in
its
way
but
probably
looks
out
a
nurse
in
some
degree
congenerous
with
whom
to
intrust
its
young
is
perfectly
new
to
me
and
struck
me
so
forcibly
that
i
naturally
fell
into
a
train
of
thought
that
led
me
to
consider
whether
the
fact
was
so
and
what
reason
there
was
for
it
when
i
came
to
recollect
and
inquire
i
could
not
find
that
any
cuckoo
had
ever
been
seen
in
these
parts
except
in
the
nest
of
the
wagtail
the
the
titlark

and
the
all
insectivorous

excellent

the
nest
of
the
palumbus
and
of
the
fringilla
chaffinch
birds
that
subsist
on
acorns
and
grains
and
such
hard
food
but
then
he
does
not
mention
them
as
of
his
own
knowledge
but
says
afterwards
that
he
saw
himself
a
wagtail
feeding
a
cuckoo
it
appears
hardly
possible
that
a
bird
should
subsist
on
the
same
food
with
the
for
the
former
have
thin
membranaceous
stomachs
suited
to
their
soft
food
while
the
latter
the
granivorous
tribe
have
strong
muscular
gizzards
which
like
mills
grind
by
the
help
of
small
gravels
and
pebbles
what
is
swallowed
this
proceeding
of
the
cuckoo
of
dropping
its
eggs
as
it
were
by
chance
is
such
a
monstrous
outrage
on
maternal
affection
one
of
the
first
great
dictates
of
nature
and
such
a
violence
on
instinct
that
had
it
only
been
related
of
a
bird
in
the
brazils
or
peru
it
would
never
have
merited
our
belief
but
yet
should
it
farther
appear
that
this
simple
bird
when
divested
of
the
natural
storge
in
greek
that
seems
to
raise
the
kind
in
general
above
themselves
and
inspire
them
with
extraordinary
degrees
of
cunning
and
address
may
be
still
endued
with
a
more
enlarged
faculty
of
discerning
what
species
are
suitable
and
congenerous
for
its
disregarded
eggs
and
young
and
may
deposit
them
only
under
their
care
this
would
be
adding
wonder
to
wonder

instancing
in
a
fresh
manner
that
the
methods
of

not

astonish
us
in

april
dear
sir
i
heard
many
birds
of
several
species
sing
last
year
after
midsummer
enough
to
prove
that
the
summer
solstice
is
not
the
period
that
puts
a
stop
to
the
music
of
the
woods
the
yellowhammer
no
doubt
persists
with
more
steadiness
than
any
other
but
the
woodlark
the
wren
the
the
swallow
the
the
goldfinch
the
common
linnet
are
all
undoubted
instances
of
the
truth
of
what
i
advance
if
this
severe
season
does
not
interrupt
the
regularity
of
the
summer
migrations
the
will
be
here
in
two
or
three
days
i
wish
it
was
in
my
power
to
procure
you
one
of
those
songsters
but
i
am
no
birdcatcher
and
so
little
used
to
birds
in
a
cage
that
i
fear
if
i
had
one
it
would
soon
die
for
want
of
skill
in
feeding

your
which
you
kept
in
a
cage

of
the
zoology
or
was
it
the
less
sparrow
of
ray
the
of
pennant
last
publication
as
to
the
matter
of
birds
growing
fatter
in
moderate
frosts
i
have
no
doubt
within
myself
what
should
be
the
reason
the
thriving
at
those
times
appears
to
me
to
arise
altogether
from
the
gentle
check
which
the
cold
throws
upon
insensible
perspiration
the
case
is
just
the
same
with
blackbirds
etc
and
farmers
and
warreners
observe
the
first
that
their
hogs
fat
more
kindly
at
such
times
and
the
latter
that
the
rabbits
are
never
in
such
good
case
as
in
a
gentle
frost
but
when
frosts
are
severe
and
of
long
continuance
the
case
is
soon
altered
for
then
a
want
of
food
soon
overbalances
the
repletion
occasioned
by
a
checked
perspiration
i
have
observed
moreover
that
some
human
constitutions
are
more
inclined
to
plumpness
in
winter
than
in
summer
when
birds
come
to
suffer
by
severe
frost
i
find
that
the
first
that
fail
and
die
are
the
and
then
the
you
wonder
with
good
reason
that
the
can
be
induced
to
sit
at
all
on
the
egg
of
the
cuckoo
without
being
scandalized
at
the
vast
disproportioned
size
of
the
supposititious
egg
but
the
brute
creation
i
suppose
have
very
little
idea
of
size
colour
or
number
for
the
common
hen
i
know
when
the
fury
of
incubation
is
on
her
will
sit
on
a
single
shapeless
stone
instead
of
a
nest
full
of
eggs
that
have
been
withdrawn
and
moreover
a
turkey
in
the
same
circumstances
would
sit
on
in
the
empty
nest
till
she
perished
with
hunger
i
think
the
matter
might
easily
be
determined
whether
a
cuckoo
lays
one
or
two
eggs
or
more
in
a
season
by
opening
a
female
during
the
if
more
than
one
was
come
down
out
of
the
ovary
and
advanced
to
a
good
size
doubtless
then
she
would
that
spring
lay
more
than
one
i
will
endeavour
to
get
a
hen
and
to
examine
your
supposition
that
there
may
be
some
natural
obstruction
in
singing
birds
while
they
are
mute
and
that
when
this
is
removed
the
song
recommences
is
new
and
bold
i
wish
you
could
discover
some
good
grounds
for
this
suspicion
i
was
glad
you
were
pleased
with
my
specimen
of
the
caprimulgus
or
you
were
i
find
acquainted
with
the
bird
before
when
we
meet
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
concerning
the
proposal
you
make
of
my
drawing
up
an
account
of
the
animals
in
this
neighbourhood
your
partiality
towards
my
small
abilities
persuades
you
i
fear
that
i
am
able
to
do
more
than
is
in
my
power
for
it
is
no
small
undertaking
for
a
man
unsupported
and
alone
to
begin
a
natural
history
from
his
own
autopsia
though
there
is
endless
room
for
observation
in
the
field
of
nature
which
is
boundless
yet
investigation
where
a
man
endeavours
to
be
sure
of
his
facts
can
make
but
slow
progress

all
that
one
could
collect

many
years

go

a
very
narrow
compass

extracts
from
your
ingenious
of
the
difference

gave
me
great
satisfaction
they
have
removed
the
objections
that
always
rose
in
my
mind
whenever
i
came
to
the
passages
which
you
quote
surely
the
judicious
virgil
when
writing
a
didactic
poem
for
the
region
of
italy

never
think
of
describing
freezing

pretty
frequently
occurred

letter
vi
to
the

barrington
selborne
may
dear
sir
the
severity
and
turbulence
of
last
month
so
interrupted
the
regular
progress
of
summer
migration
that
some
of
the
birds
do
but
just
begin
to
show
themselves
and
others
are
apparently
thinner
than
usual
as
the
the
the
the
catcher
i
well
remember
that
after
the
very
severe
spring
in
the
year
summer
birds
of
passage
were
very
scarce
they
come
probably
hither
with
a
wind
or
when
it
blows
between
those
points
but
in
that
unfavourable
year
the
winds
blowed
the
whole
spring
and
summer
through
from
the
opposite
quarters
and
yet
amidst
all
these
disadvantages
two
swallows
as
i
mentioned
in
my
last
appeared
this
year
as
early
as
the
eleventh
of
april
amidst
frost
and
snow
but
they
withdrew
again
for
a
time
i
am
not
pleased
to
find
that
some
people
seem
so
little
satisfied
with
scopoli
new
publication
there
is
room
to
expect
great
things
from
the
hands
of
that
man
who
is
a
good
naturalist
and
one
would
think
that
an
history
of
the
birds
of
so
distant
and
southern
a
region
as
carniola
would
be
new
and
interesting
i
could
wish
to
see
that
work
and
hope
to
get
it
sent
down
scopoli
is
physician
to
the
wretches
that
work
in
the
quicksilver
mines
of
that
district
this
work
he
calls
his
annus
primus
when
you
talked
of
keeping
a
and
giving
it
seeds
i
could
not
help
wondering
because
the
which
i
mentioned
to
you
passer
arundinaceus
minor
raii
is
a
bird
and
most
probably
migrates
hence
before
winter
whereas
the
bird
you
kept
passer
torquatus
raii
abides
all
the
year
and
is
a
bird
i
question
whether
the
latter
be
much
of
a
songster
but
in
this
matter
i
want
to
be
better
informed
the
former
has
a
variety
of
hurrying
notes
and
sings
all
night
some
part
of
the
song
of
the
former
i
suspect
is
attributed
to
the
latter
we
have
plenty
of
the
sort
which
pennant
had
entirely
left
out
of
his
british
zoology
till
i
reminded
him
of
his
omission
see
british
zoology
last
published
p
see
letter
xxv
to
mr
pennant
i
have
somewhat
to
advance
on
the
different
manners
in
which
different
birds
fly
and
walk
but
as
this
is
a
subject
that
i
have
not
enough
considered
and
is
of
such
a
nature
as
not
to
be
contained
in
a
small
space
i
shall
say
nothing
farther
about
it
at
present
see
letter
xliii
to
mr
barrington
no
doubt
the
reason
why
the
sex
of
birds
in
their
first
plumage
is
so
difficult
to
be
distinguished
is
as
you
say
they
are
not
to
pair
and
discharge
their
parental
functions
till
the
ensuing
spring
as
colours
seem
to
be
the
chief
external
sexual
distinction
in
many
birds
these
colours
do
not
take
place
till
sexual
attachments
begin
to
obtain
and
the
case
is
the
same
in
quadrupeds
among
whom
in
their
younger
days
the
sexes
differ
but
little
but
as
they
advance
to
maturity
horns
and
shaggy
manes
beards
and
brawny
necks
strongly
discriminate
the
male
from
the
female
we
may
instance
still
farther
in
our
own
species
where
a
beard
and
stronger
features
are
usually
characteristic
of
the
male
sex
but
this
sexual
diversity
does
not
take
place
in
earlier
life
for
a
beautiful
youth
shall
be
so
like
a
beautiful
girl
that
the
difference
shall
not
be
discernible

have

primus
with
satisfaction
for
though
some
parts
of
this
work
are
exceptionable
and
he
may
advance
some
mistaken
observations
yet
the
ornithology
of
so
distant
a
country
as
carniola
is
very
curious
men
that
undertake
only
one
district
are
much
more
likely
to
advance
natural
knowledge
than
those
that
grasp
at
more
than
they
can
possibly
be
acquainted
with
every
kingdom
every
province
should
have
its
own
monographer
the
reason
perhaps
why
he
mentions
nothing
of
ray
ornithology
may
be
the
extreme
poverty
and
distance
of
his
country
into
which
the
works
of
our
great
naturalist
may
have
never
yet
found
their
way
you
have
doubts
i
know
whether
this
ornithology
is
genuine
and
really
the
work
of
scopoli
as
to
myself
i
think
i
discover
strong
tokens
of
authenticity
the
style
corresponds
with
that
of
his
entomology
and
his
characters
of
his
ordines
and
genera
are
many
of
them
new
expressive
and
masterly
he
has
ventured
to
alter
some
of
the
linnaean
genera
with
sufficient
show
of
reason
it
might
perhaps
be
mere
accident
that
you
saw
so
many
swifts
and
no
swallows
at
staines
because
in
my
long
observations
of
those
birds
i
never
could
discover
the
least
degree
of
rivalry
or
hostility
between
the
species
ray
remarks
that
birds
of
the
gallinae
order
as
cocks
and
hens
partridges
and
pheasants
are
pulveratrices
such
as
dust
themselves
using
that
method
of
cleansing
their
feathers
and
ridding
themselves
of
their
vermin
as
far
as
i
can
observe
many
birds
that
dust
themselves
never
wash
and
i
once
thought
that
those
birds
that
wash
themselves
would
never
dust
but
here
i
find
myself
mistaken
for
common
are
great
pulveratrices
being
frequency
seen
grovelling
and
wallowing
in
dusty
roads
and
yet
they
are
great
washers

purification
from
these
pulveratrices
because
i
find
from
travellers
of
credit
that
if
a
strict
mussulman
is
journeying
in
a
sandy
desert
where
no
water
is
to
be
found
at
stated
hours
he
strips
off
his
clothes
and
most
scrupulously
rubs
his
body
over
with
sand
or
dust
a
countryman
told
me
he
had
found
a
young
in
the
nest
of
a
small
bird
on
the
ground
and
that
it
was
fed
by
the
little
bird
i
went
to
see
this
extraordinary
phenomenon
and
found
that
it
was
a
young
cuckoo
hatched
in
the
nest
of
a
titlark
it
was
become
vastly
too
big
for
its
nest
appearing
in
tenui
re
majores
pennas
nido
extendisse
and
was
very
fierce
and
pugnacious
pursuing
my
finger
as
i
teased
it
for
many
feet
from
the
nest
and
sparring
and
buffeting
with
its
wings
like
a
the
dupe
of
a
dam
appeared
at
a
distance
hovering
about
with
meat
in
its
mouth
and
expressing
the
greatest
solicitude
in
july
i
saw
several
cuckoos
skimming
over
a
large
pond
and
found
after
some
observation
that
they
were
feeding
on
the
libellulae
or
some
of
which
they
caught
as
they
settled
on
the
weeds
and
some
as
they
were
on
the
wing
notwithstanding
what
linnaeus
says
i
can
not
be
induced
to
believe
that
they
are
birds
of
prey
this
district
affords
some
birds
that
are
hardly
ever
heard
of
at
selborne
in
the
first
place
considerable
flocks
of
loxiae
curvirostrae
have
appeared
this
summer
in
the
belonging
to
this
house
the
is
said
to
haunt
the
mouth
of
the
lewes
river
near
newhaven
and
the
cornish
chough
builds
i
know
all
along
the
chalky
cliffs
of
the
sussex
shore
i
was
greatly
pleased
to
see
little
parties
of
my
discovered
migrators
scattered
at
intervals
all
along
the
downs
from
chichester
to
lewes
let
them
come
from
whence
they
will
it
looks
very
auspicious
that
they
are
cantoned
along
the
coast
in
order
to
pass
the
channel
when
severe
weather
advances
they
visit
us
again
in
april
as
it
should
seem
in
their
return
and
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
dead
of
winter
it
is
remarkable
that
they
are
very
tame
and
seem
to
have
no
manner
of
apprehensions
of
danger
from
a
person
with
a
gun
there
are
bustards
on
the
wide
downs
near
brighthelmstone
no
doubt
you
are
acquainted
with
the
the
prospects
and
rides
round
lewes
are
most
lovely
as
i
rode
along
near
the
coast
i
kept
a
very
sharp
lookout
in
the
lanes
and
woods
hoping
i
might
at
this
time
of
the
year
have
discovered
some
of
the
summer
birds
of
passage
crowding
towards
the
coast
in
order
for
their
departure
but
it
was
very
extraordinary
that
i
never
saw
a
cap
uncrested
wren
etc
and
i
remember
to
have
made
the
same
remark
in
former
years
as
i
usually
come
to
this
place
annually
about
this
time
the
birds
most
common
along
the
coast
at
present
are
the
buntings
linnets
some
few
wheatears
titlarks
etc
swallows
and
martins
abound
yet
induced
to
prolong
their
stay
by
this
soft
still
dry
season
a
which
has
been
kept
for
thirty
years
in
a
little
walled
court
belonging
to
the
house
where
i
now
am
visiting
retires
under
ground
about
the
middle
of
november
and
comes
forth
again
about
the
middle
of
april
when
it
first
appears
in
the
spring
it
discovers
very
little
inclination
towards
food
but
in
the
height
of
summer
grows
voracious
and
then
as
the
summer
declines
its
appetite
declines
so
that
for
the
last
six
weeks
in
autumn
it
hardly
eats
at
all
milky
plants
such
as
lettuces
dandelions
are
its
favourite
dish
in
a
neighbouring
village
one
was
kept
till
by
tradition
it
was
supposed
to
be
an
hundred
years
old
an
instance
of
vast
longevity
in
such
a
poor

letter
viii
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
dear
sir
the
birds
that
i
took
for
aberdavines
were
passeres
torquati
there
are
doubtless
many
home
internal
migrations
within
this
kingdom
that
want
to
be
better
understood
witness
those
vast
flocks
of
hen
chaffinches
that
appear
with
us
in
the
winter
without
hardly
any
cocks
among
them
now
was
there
a
due
proportion
of
each
sex
it
should
seem
very
improbable
that
any
one
district
should
produce
such
numbers
of
these
little
birds
and
much
more
when
only
half
of
the
species
appears
therefore
we
may
conclude
that
the
fringillae
caelebes
for
some
good
purposes
have
a
peculiar
migration
of
their
own
in
which
the
sexes
part
nor
should
it
seem
so
wonderful
that
the
intercourse
of
sexes
in
this
species
of
birds
should
be
interrupted
in
winter
since
in
many
animals
and
particularly
in
bucks
and
does
the
sexes
herd
separately
except
at
the
season
when
commerce
is
necessary
for
the
continuance
of
the
breed
for
this
matter
of
the
chaffinches
see
fauna
suecica
and
systema
naturae
i
see
every
winter
vast
flights
of
hen
chaffinches
but
none
of
cocks
your
method
of
accounting
for
the
periodical
motions
of
the
british
singing
birds
or
birds
of
flight
is
a
very
probable
one
since
the
matter
of
food
is
a
great
regulator
of
the
actions
and
proceedings
of
the
brute
creation
there
is
but
one
that
can
be
set
in
competition
with
it
and
that
is
love
but
i
can
not
quite
acquiesce
with
you
in
one
circumstance
when
you
advance
that
they
have
thus
feasted
they
again
separate
into
small
parties
of
five
or
six
and
get
the
best
fare
they
can
within
a
certain
district
having
no
inducement
to
go
in
quest
of
earth
now
if
you
mean
that
the
business
of
congregating
is
quite
at
an
end
from
the
conclusion
of
to
the
season
of
barley
and
oats
it
is
not
the
case
with
us
for
larks
and
chaffinches
and
particularly
linnets
flock
and
congregate
as
much
in
the
very
dead
of
winter
as
when
the
husbandman
is
busy
with
his
ploughs
and
harrows
sure
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
woodcocks
and
fieldfares
leave
us
in
the
spring
in
order
to
cross
the
seas
and
to
retire
to
some
districts
more
suitable
to
the
purpose
of
breeding
that
the
former
pair
before
they
retire
and
that
the
hens
are
forward
with
egg
i
myself
when
i
was
a
sportsman
have
often
experienced
it
can
not
indeed
be
denied
but
that
now
and
then
we
hear
of
a
nest
or
young
birds
discovered
in
some
part
or
other
of
this
island
but
then
they
are
always
mentioned
as
rarities
and
somewhat
out
of
the
common
course
of
things
but
as
to
redwings
and
fieldfares
no
sportsman
or
naturalist
has
ever
yet
that
i
could
hear
pretended
to
have
found
the
nest
or
young
of
those
species
in
any
part
of
these
kingdoms
and
i
the
more
admire
at
this
instance
as
extraordinary
since
to
all
appearance
the
same
food
in
summer
as
well
as
in
winter
might
support
them
here
which
maintains
their
congeners
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
did
they
choose
to
stay
the
summer
through
from
hence
it
appears
that
it
is
not
food
alone
which
determines
some
species
of
birds
with
regard
to
their
stay
or
departure
fieldfares
and
redwings
disappear
sooner
or
later
according
as
the
warm
weather
comes
on
earlier
or
later
for
i
well
remember
after
that
dreadful
winter
of
that
cold
east
winds
continued
to
blow
on
through
april
and
may
and
that
these
kinds
of
birds
what
few
remained
of
them
did
not
depart
as
usual
but
were
seen
lingering
about
till
the
beginning
of
june
the
best
authority
that
we
can
have
for
the
nidification
of
the
birds
in
any
district
is
the
testimony
of
faunists
that
have
written
professedly
the
natural
history
of
particular
countries
now
as
to
the
fieldfare
linnaeus
in
his
fauna
suecica
says
of
it
that
in
arboribus
nidificat
and
of
the
redwing
he
says
in
the
same
place
that
in
mediis
arbusculis
sive
sepibus
ova
sex
maculis
nigris
variis
hence
we
may
be
assured
that
fieldfares
and
redwings
breed
in
sweden
scopoli
says
in
his
annus
primus
of
the
woodcock
that
ad
nos
venit
circa
aequinoctium
vernale
meaning
in
tirol
of
which
he
is
a
native
and
afterwards
he
adds
in
paludibus
alpinis
ova
ponit
it
does
not
appear
from
kramer
that
woodcocks
breed
at
all
in
austria
but
he
says
haec
septentrionalium
provinciarum
aestivo

plerumque

appropinquante
hyeme

redit
for
the
whole
passage
which
i
have
abridged
see
elenchus
this
seems
to
be
a
full
proof
of
the
migration
of
woodcocks
though
little
is
proved
concerning
the
place
of
breeding
there
fell
in
the
county
of
rutland
in
three
weeks
of
this
present
very
wet
weather
seven
inches
and
an
half
of
rain
which
is
more
than
has
fallen
in
any
three
weeks
for
these
thirty
years
past
in
that
part
of
the
world
a
mean
quantity
in
that
county

twenty
inches
and
an
half
letter
ix
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
fyfield
near
andover
dear
sir
you
are
i
know
no
great
friend
to
migration
and
the
well
attested
accounts
from
various
parts
of
the
kingdom
seem
to
justify
you
in
your
suspicions
that
at
least
many
of
the
swallow
kind
do
not
leave
us
in
the
winter
but
lay
themselves
up
like
insects
and
bats
in
a
torpid
state
to
slumber
away
the
more
uncomfortable
months
till
the
return
of
the
sun
and
fine
weather
awakens
them
but
then
we
must
not
i
think
deny
migration
in
general
because
migration
certainly
does
subsist
in
some
places
as
my
brother
in
andalusia
has
fully
informed
me
of
the
motions
of
these
birds
he
has
ocular
demonstration
for
many
weeks
together
both
spring
and
fall
during
which
periods
myriads
of
the
swallow
kind
traverse
the
straits
from
north
to
south
and
from
south
to
north
according
to
the
season
and
these
vast
migrations
consist
not
only
of
hirundines
but
of
hoopoes
oro
pendolos
or
golden
thrushes
and
also
many
of
our
of
passage
and
moreover
of
birds
which
never
leave
us
such
as
all
the
various
sorts
of
hawks
and
kites
old
belon
two
hundred
years
ago
gives
a
curious
account
of
the
incredible
armies
of
hawks
and
kites
which
he
saw
in
the
traversing
the
thracian
bosphorus
from
asia
to
europe
besides
the
he
remarks
that
the
procession
is
swelled
by
whole
troops
of
eagles
and
vultures
now
it
is
no
wonder
that
birds
residing
in
africa
should
retreat
before
the
sun
as
it
advances
and
retire
to
milder
regions
and
especially
birds
of
prey
whose
blood
being
heated
with
hot
animal
food
are
more
impatient
of
a
sultry
climate
but
then
i
can
not
help
wondering
why
kites
and
hawks
and
such
hardy
birds
as
are
known
to
defy
all
the
severity
of
england
and
even
of
sweden
and
all
north
europe
should
want
to
migrate
from
the
south
of
europe
and
be
dissatisfied
with
the
winters
of
andalusia
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
much
stress
may
be
laid
on
the
difficulty
and
hazard
that
birds
must
run
in
their
migrations
by
reason
of
vast
oceans
cross
winds
etc
because
if
we
reflect
a
bird
may
travel
from
england
to
the
equator
without
launching
out
and
exposing
itself
to
boundless
seas
and
that
by
crossing
the
water
at
dover
and
again
at
gibraltar
and
i
with
the
more
confidence
advance
this
obvious
remark
because
my
brother
has
always
found
that
some
of
his
birds
and
particularly
the
swallow
kind
are
very
sparing
of
their
pains
in
crossing
the
mediterranean
for
when
arrived
at
gibraltar
they
do
not
rang
in
figure
wedge
their
way
and
set
forth
their
airy
caravan
high
over
seas
flying
and
over
lands
with
mutual
wing
easing
their
flight
milton
but
scout
and
hurry
along
in
little
detached
parties
of
six
or
seven
in
a
company
and
sweeping
low
just
over
the
surface
of
the
land
and
water
direct
their
course
to
the
opposite
continent
at
the
narrowest
passage
they
can
find
they
usually
slope
across
the
bay
to
the
and
so
pass
over
opposite
to
tangier
which
it
seems
is
the
narrowest
space
in
former
letters
we
have
considered
whether
it
was
probable
that
woodcocks
in
nights
cross
the
german
ocean
from
scandinavia
as
a
proof
that
birds
of
less
speed
may
pass
that
sea
considerable
as
it
is
i
shall
relate
the
following
incident
which
though
mentioned
to
have
happened
so
many
years
ago
was
strictly
matter
of
fact
as
some
people
were
shooting
in
the
parish
of
trotton
in
the
county
of
sussex
they
killed
a
duck
in
that
dreadful
winter
with
a
silver
collar
about
its
neck
on
which
were
engraven
the
arms
of
the
king
of
denmark
this
anecdote
the
rector
of
trotton
at
that
time
has
often
told
to
a
near
relation
of
mine
and
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
the
collar
was
in
the
possession
of
the
rector
i
have
read
a
like
anecdote
of
a
swan
at
present
i
do
not
know
anybody
near
the
that
will
take
the
trouble
to
remark
at
what
time
of
the
moon
woodcocks
first
come
if
i
lived
near
the
sea
myself
i
would
soon
tell
you
more
of
the
matter
one
thing
i
used
to
observe
when
i
was
a
sportsman
that
there
were
times
in
which
woodcocks
were
so
sluggish
and
sleepy
that
they
would
drop
again
when
flushed
just
before
the
spaniels
nay
just
at
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
that
had
been
fired
at
them
whether
this
strange
laziness
was
the
effect
of
a
recent
fatiguing
journey
i
shall
not
presume
to
say
nightingales
not
only
never
reach
northumberland
and
scotland
but
also
as
i
have
been
always
told
devonshire
and
cornwall
in
those
two
last
counties
we
can
not
attribute
the
failure
of
them
to
the
want
of
warmth
the
defect
in
the
west
is
rather
a
presumptive
argument
that
these
birds
come
over
to
us
from
the
continent
at
the
narrowest
passage
and
do
not
stroll
so
far
westward
let
me
hear
from
your
own
observation
whether
skylarks
do
not
dust
i
think
they
do
and
if
they
do
whether
they
wash
also
the
alauda
pratensis
of
ray
was
the
poor
dupe
that
was
educating
the
booby
of
a
cuckoo
mentioned
in
my
letter
of
october
last
your
letter
came
too
late
for
me
to
procure
a
for
tunstal
during
their
autumnal
visit
but
i
will
endeavour
to
get
him
one
when
they
call
on
us
again
in
april
i
am
glad
that
you
and
that
gentleman
saw
my
andalusian
birds
i
hope
they
answered
your
expectation
royston
or
grey
crows
are
winter
birds
that
come
much
about
the
same
time
with
the
woodcock
they
like
the
fieldfare
and
redwing
have
no
apparent
reason
for
migration
for
as
they
fare
in
the
winter
like
their
congeners
so
might
they
in
all
appearance
in
the
summer
was
not
tenant
when
a
boy
mistaken
did
he
not
find
a
nest
and
take
it
for
the
nest
of
a
fieldfare
the
or
oenas
raii
is
the
last
winter
bird
of
passage
which
appears
with
us
and
is
not
seen
till
towards
the
end
of
november
about
twenty
years
ago
they
abounded
in
the
district
of
selborne
and
strings
of
them
were
seen
morning
and
evening
that
reached
a
mile
or
more
but
since
the
beechen
woods
have
been
greatly
thinned
they
are
much
decreased
in
number
the
palumbus
raii
stays
with
us
the
whole
year
and
breeds
several
times
through
the
summer
before
i
received
your
letter
of
october
last
i
had
just
remarked
in
my
journal
that
the
trees
were
unusually
green
this
uncommon
verdure
lasted
on
late
into
november
and
may
be
accounted
for
from
a
late
spring
a
cool
and
moist
summer
but
more
particularly
from
vast
armies
of
chafers
or
tree
beetles
which
in
many
places
reduced
whole
woods
to
a
leafless
naked
state
these
trees
shot
again
at
midsummer
and
then
retained
their
foliage
till
very
late
in
the
year
my
musical
friend
at
whose
house
i
am
now
visiting
has
tried
all
the
owls
that
are
his
near
neighbours
with
a
set

and
finds
they
all
hoot

will

letter

the

selborne
dear
sir
from
what
follows
it
will
appear
that
neither
owls
nor
cuckoos
keep
to
one
note
a
friend
remarks
that
many
most
of
his
owls
hoot
in
b
flat
but
that
one
went
almost
half
a
note
below
a
the
pipe
he
tried
their
notes
by
was
a
common
such
as
masters
use
for
tuning
of
harpsichords
it
was
the
common
london
pitch
a
neighbour
of
mine
who
is
said
to
have
a
nice
ear
remarks
that
the
owls
about
this
village
hoot
in
three
different
keys
in
g
flat
or
f
sharp
in
b
flat
and
a
flat
he
heard
two
hooting
to
each
other
the
one
in
a
flat
and
the
other
in
b
flat
query
do
these
different
notes
proceed
from
different
species
or
only
from
various
individuals
the
same
person
finds
upon
trial
that
the
note
of
the
cuckoo
of
which
we
have
but
one
species
varies
in
different
individuals
for
about
selborne
wood
he
found
they
were
mostly
in
d
he
heard
two
sing
together
the
one
in
d
the
other
in
d
sharp
who
made
a
disagreeable
concert
he
afterwards
heard
one
in
d
sharp
and
about
some
in
as
to
nightingales
he
says
that
their
notes
are
so
short
and
their
transitions
so
rapid
that
he
can
not
well
ascertain
their
key
perhaps
in
a
cage
and
in
a
room
their
notes
may
be
more
distinguishable
this
person
has
tried
to
settle
the
notes
of
a
swift
and
of
several
other
small
birds
but
can
not
bring
them
to
any
criterion
as
i
have
often
remarked
that
redwings
are
some
of
the
first
birds
that
suffer
with
us
in
severe
weather
it
is
no
wonder
at
all
they
retreat
from

winters

much
more

am
glad
you
are
making
inquiries
from
linnaeus
concerning
the
woodcock
it
is
expected
of
him
that
he
should
be
able
to
account
for
the
motions
and
manner
of
life
of
the
animals
of
his
own
fauna
faunists
as
you
observe
are
too
apt
to
acquiesce
in
bare
descriptions
and
a
few
synonyms
the
reason
is
plain
because
all
that
may
be
done
at
home
in
a
man
study
but
the
investigation
of
the
life
and
conversation
of
animals
is
a
concern
of
much
more
trouble
and
difficulty
and
is
not
to
be
attained
but
by
the
active
and
inquisitive
and
by
those
that
reside
much
in
the
country
foreign
systematics
are
i
observe
much
too
vague
in
their
specific
differences
which
are
almost
universally
constituted
by
one
or
two
particular
marks
the
rest
of
the
description
running
in
general
terms
but
our
countryman
the
excellent
ray
is
the
only
describer
that
conveys
some
precise
idea
in
every
term
or
word
maintaining
his
superiority
over
his
followers
and
imitators
in
spite
of
the
advantage
of
fresh
discoveries
and
modern
information
at
this
distance
of
years
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
recollect
at
what
periods
woodcocks
used
to
be
sluggish
or
alert
when
i
was
a
sportsman
but
upon
my
mentioning
this
circumstance
to
a
friend
he
thinks
he
has
observed
them
to
be
remarkably
listless
against
snowy
foul
weather
if
this
should
be
the
case
then
the
inaptitude
for
flying
arises
only
from
an
eagerness
for
food
as
sheep
are
observed
to
be
very
intent
on
grazing
against
stormy
wet
evenings

letter
xi
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
dear
sir
when
i
ride
about
in
the
winter
and
see
such
prodigious
flocks
of
various
kinds
of
birds
i
can
not
help
admiring
at
these
congregations
and
wishing
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
account
for
those
appearances
almost
peculiar
to
the
season
the
two
great
motives
which
regulate
the
proceedings
of
the
brute
creation
are
love
and
hunger
the
former
incites
animals
to
perpetuate
their
kind
the
latter
induces
them
to
preserve
individuals
whether
either
of
these
should
seem
to
be
the
ruling
passion
in
the
matter
of
congregating
is
to
be
considered
as
to
love
that
is
out
of
the
question
at
a
time
of
the
year
when
that
soft
passion
is
not
indulged
besides
during
the
amorous
season
such
a
jealousy
prevails
between
the
male
birds
that
they
can
hardly
bear
to
be
together
in
the
same
hedge
or
field
most
of
the
singing
and
elation
of
spirits
of
that
time
seem
to
me
to
be
the
effect
of
rivalry
and
emulation
and
it
is
to
this
spirit
of
jealousy
that
i
chiefly
attribute
the
equal
dispersion
of
birds
in
the
spring
over
the
face
of
the
country
now
as
to
the
business
of
food
as
these
animals
are
actuated
by
instinct
to
hunt
for
necessary
food
they
should
not
one
would
suppose
crowd
together
in
pursuit
of
sustenance
at
a
time
when
it
is
most
likely
to
fail
yet
such
associations
do
take
place
in
hard
weather
chiefly
and
thicken
as
the
severity
increases
as
some
kind
of
and
is
no
doubt
the
motive
for
the
proceeding
may
it
not
arise
from
the
helplessness
of
their
state
in
such
rigorous
seasons
as
men
crowd
together
when
under
great
calamities
though
they
know
not
why
perhaps
approximation
may
dispel
some
degree
of
cold
and
a
crowd
may
make
each
individual
appear
safer
from
the
ravages
of
birds
of
prey
and
other
dangers
if
i
admire
when
i
see
how
much
congenerous
birds
love
to
congregate
i
am
the
more
struck
when
i
see
incongruous
ones
in
such
strict
amity
if
we
do
not
much
wonder
to
see
a
flock
of
rooks
usually
attended
by
a
train
of
dews
yet
it
is
strange
that
the
former
should
so
frequently
have
a
flight
of
starlings
for
their
satellites
is
it
because
rooks
have
a
more
discerning
scent
than
their
attendants
and
can
lead
them
to
spots
more
productive
of
food
anatomists
say
that
rooks
by
reason
of
two
large
nerves
which
run
down
between
the
eyes
into
the
upper
mandible
have
a
more
delicate
feeling
in
their
beaks
than
other
birds
and
can
grope
for
their
meat
when
out
of
sight
perhaps
then
their
associates
attend
them
on
the
motive
of
interest
as
greyhounds
wait
on
the
motions
of
their
finders
and
as
lions
are
said
to
do
on
the
yelpings
of
jackals
lapwings
and
starlings
sometimes

letter

to

march
dear
sir
as
a
gentleman
and
myself
were
walking
on
the
fourth
of
last
november
round
the
at
newhaven
near
the
mouth
of
the
lewes
river
in
pursuit
of
natural
knowledge
we
were
surprised
to
see
three
gliding
very
swiftly
by
us
that
morning
was
rather
chilly
with
the
wind
at
but
the
tenor
of
the
weather
for
some
time
before
had
been
delicate
and
the
noons
remarkably
warm
from
this
incident
and
from
repeated
accounts
which
i
meet
with
i
am
more
and
more
induced
to
believe
that
many
of
the
swallow
kind
do
not
depart
from
this
island
but
lay
themselves
up
in
holes
and
caverns
and
do
and
like
come
forth
at
mild
times
and
than
retire
again
to
their
latebrae
nor
make
i
the
least
doubt
but
that
if
i
lived
at
newhaven
seaford
brighthelmstone
or
any
of
those
towns
near
the
of
the
sussex
coast
by
proper
observations
i
should
see
swallows
stirring
at
periods
of
the
winter
when
the
noons
were
soft
and
inviting
and
the
sun
warm
and
invigorating
and
i
am
the
more
of
this
opinion
from
what
i
have
remarked
during
some
of
our
late
springs
that
though
some
swallows
did
make
their
appearance
about
the
usual
time
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
of
april
yet
meeting
with
an
harsh
reception
and
blustering
cold
winds
they
immediately
withdrew
absconding
for
several
days
till
the
weather
gave
them
better
encouragement
letter
xiii
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
april
dear
sir
while
i
was
in
sussex
last
autumn
my
residence
was
at
the
village
near
lewes
from
whence
i
had
formerly
the
pleasure
of
writing
to
you
on
the
first
of
november
i
remarked
that
the
old
tortoise
formerly
mentioned
began
first
to
dig
the
ground
in
order
to
the
forming
its
hybernaculum
which
it
had
fixed
on
just
beside
a
great
tuft
of
hepaticas
it
scrapes
out
the
ground
with
its
and
throws
it
up
over
its
back
with
its
hind
but
the
motion
of
its
legs
is
ridiculously
slow
little
exceeding
the
of
a
clock
and
suitable
to
the
composure
of
an
animal
said
to
be
a
whole
month
in
performing
one
feat
of
copulation
nothing
can
be
more
assiduous
than
this
creature
night
and
day
in
scooping
the
earth
and
forcing
its
great
body
into
the
cavity
but
as
the
noons
of
that
season
proved
unusually
warm
and
sunny
it
was
continually
interrupted
and
called
forth
by
the
heat
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
though
i
continued
there
till
the
thirteenth
of
november
yet
the
work
remained
unfinished
harsher
weather
and
frosty
mornings
would
have
quickened
its
operations
no
part
of
its
behaviour
ever
struck
me
more
than
the
extreme
timidity
it
always
expresses
with
regard
to
rain
for
though
it
has
a
shell
that
would
secure
it
against
the
wheel
of
a
loaded
cart
yet
does
it
discover
as
much
solicitude
about
rain
as
a
lady
dressed
in
all
her
best
attire
shuffling
away
on
the
first
sprinklings
and
running
its
head
up
in
a
corner
if
attended
to
it
becomes
an
excellent
for
as
sure
as
it
walks
elate
and
as
it
were
on
tiptoe
feeding
with
great
earnestness
in
a
morning
so
sure
will
it
rain
before
night
it
is
totally
a
diurnal
animal
and
never
pretends
to
stir
after
it
becomes
dark
the
tortoise
like
other
reptiles
has
an
arbitrary
stomach
as
well
as
lungs
and
can
refrain
from
eating
as
well
as
breathing
for
a
great
part
of
the
year
when
first
awakened
it
eats
nothing
nor
again
in
the
autumn
before
it
retires
through
the
height
of
the
summer
it
feeds
voraciously
devouring
all
the
food
that
comes
in
its
way
i
was
much
taken
with
its
sagacity
in
discerning
those
that
do
it
kind
offices
for
as
soon
as
the
good
old
lady
comes
in
sight
who
has
waited
on
it
for
more
than
thirty
years
it
hobbles
towards
its
benefactress
with
awkward
alacrity
but
remains
inattentive
to
strangers
thus
not
only
ox
knoweth
his
owner
and
the
ass
has
master
crib
but
the
most
abject
reptile
and
torpid
of
beings
distinguishes
the
hand
that
feeds
it
and
is
touched
with
the
feelings
of
gratitude

dear
sir
the
more
i
reflect
on
the
storge
in
greek
of
animals
the
more
i
am
astonished
at
its
effects
nor
is
the
violence
of
this
affection
more
wonderful
than
the
shortness
of
its
duration
thus
every
hen
is
in
her
turn
the
virago
of
the
yard
in
proportion
to
the
helplessness
of
her
brood
and
will
fly
in
the
face
of
a
dog
or
a
sow
in
defence
of
those
chickens
which
in
a
few
weeks
she
will
drive
before
her
with
relentless
cruelty
this
affection
sublimes
the
passions
quickens
the
invention
and
sharpens
the
sagacity
of
the
brute
creation
thus
an
hen
just
become
a
mother
is
no
longer
that
placid
bird
she
used
to
be
but
with
feathers
standing
on
end
wings
hovering
and
clocking
note
she
runs
about
like
one
possessed
dams
will
throw
themselves
in
the
way
of
the
greatest
danger
in
order
to
avert
it
from
their
progeny
thus
a
partridge
will
tumble
along
before
a
sportsman
in
order
to
draw
away
the
dogs
from
her
helpless
covey
in
the
time
of

the

are
up
in

at
the
sight
of
an
hawk
whom
they
will
persecute
till
he
leaves
that
district
a
very
exact
observer
has
often
remarked
that
a
pair
of
ravens
nesting
in
the
rock
of
gibraltar
would
suffer
no
vulture
or
eagle
to
rest
near
their
station
but
would
drive
them
from
the
hill
with
an
amazing
fury
even
the
blue
thrush
at
the
season
of
breeding
would
dart
out
from
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
to
chase
away
the
kestril
or
the
if
you
stand
near
the
nest
of
a
bird
that
has
young
she
will
not
be
induced
to
betray
them
by
an
inadvertent
fondness
but
will
wait
about
at
a
distance
with
meat
in
her
mouth
for
an
hour
together
should
i
farther
corroborate
what
i
have
advanced
above
by
some
anecdotes
which
i
probably
may
have
mentioned
before
in
conversation
yet
you
will
i
trust
pardon
the
repetition
for
the
sake
of
illustration
the
of
the
zoology
the
stoparola
of
ray
builds
every
year
in
the
vines
that
grow
on
the
walls
of
my
house
a
pair
of
these
little
birds
had
one
year
inadvertently
placed
their
nest
on
a
naked
bough
perhaps
in
a
shady
time
not
being
aware
of
the
inconvenience
that
followed
but
an
hot
sunny
season
coming
on
before
the
brood
was
half
fledged
the
reflection
of
the
wall
became
insupportable
and
must
inevitably
have
destroyed
the
tender
young
had
not
affection
suggested
an
expedient
and
prompted
the
to
hover
over
the
nest
all
the
hotter
hours
while
with
wings
expanded
and
mouths
gaping
for
breath
they
screened
off
the
heat
from
their
suffering
offspring
a
farther
instance
i
once
saw
of
notable
sagacity
in
a
which
had
built
in
a
bank
in
my
fields
this
bird
a
friend
and
myself
had
observed
as
she
sat
in
her
nest
but
were
particularly
careful
not
to
disturb
her
though
we
saw
she
eyed
us
with
some
degree
of
jealousy
some
days
after
as
we
passed
that
way
we
were
desirous
of
remarking
how
this
brood
went
on
but
no
nest
could
be
found
till
i
happened
to
take
up
a
large
bundle
of
long
green
moss
as
it
were
carelessly
thrown
over
the
nest
in
order
to
dodge
the
eye
of
any
impertinent
intruder
a
still
more
remarkable
mixture
of
sagacity
and
instinct
occurred
to
me
one
day
as
my
people
were
pulling
off
the
lining
of
an
hotbed
in
order
to
add
some
fresh
dung
from
out
of
the

of

an
animal
with
great
agility
that
made
a
most
grotesque
figure
nor
was
it
without
great
difficulty
that
it
could
be
taken
when
it
proved
to
be
a
large
with
three
or
four
young
clinging
to
her
teats
by
their
mouths
and
feet
it
was
amazing
that
the
desultory
and
rapid
motions
of
this
dam
should
not
oblige
her
litter
to
quit
their
hold
especially
when
it
appeared
that
they
were
so
young
as
to
be
both
naked
and
blind

these
instances
of
tender
attachment
many
more
of
which
might
be
daily
discovered
by
those
that
are
studious

be

rage
of
affection
that
monstrous
perversion
of
the
otorge
in
greek
which
induces
some
females
of
the
brute
creation
to
devour
their
young
because
their
owners
have
handled
them
too
freely
or
removed
them
from

swine
and
sometimes
the
more
gentle
race
of
dogs
and

are
guilty
of
this
horrid
and
preposterous
murder
when
i
hear
now
and
then
of
an
abandoned
mother
that
destroys
her
offspring
i
am
not
so
much
amazed
since
reason
perverted
and
the
bad
passions
let
loose
are
capable
of
any
enormity
but
why
the
parental
feelings
of
brutes
that
usually
flow
in

sometimes

letter
xv
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
july
dear
sir
some
young
men
went
down
lately
to
a
pond
on
the
verge
of
to
hunt
flappers
or
young
many
of
which
they
caught
and
among
the
rest
some
very
minute
yet
fledged
alive
which
upon
examination
i
found
to
be
teals
i
did
not
know
till
then
that
teals
ever
bred
in
the
south
of
england
and
was
much
pleased
with
the
discovery
this
i
look
upon
as
a
great
stroke
in
natural
history
we
have
had
ever
since
i
can
remember
a
pair
of
white
owls
that
constantly
breed
under
the
eaves
of
this
church
as
i
have
paid
good
attention
to
the
manner
of
life
of
these
birds
during
their
season
of
breeding
which
lasts
the
summer
through
the
following
remarks
may
not
perhaps
be
unacceptable
about
an
hour
before
sunset
for
then
the
mice
begin
to
run
they
sally
forth
in
quest
of
prey
and
hunt
all
round
the
hedges
of
meadows
and
small
enclosures
for
them
which
seem
to
be
their
only
food
in
this
irregular
country
we
can
stand
on
an
eminence
and
see
them
beat
the
fields
over
like
a
and
often
drop
down
in
the
grass
or
corn
i
have
minuted
these
birds
with
my
watch
for
an
hour
together
and
have
found
that
they
return
to
their
nests
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
about
once
in
five
minutes
reflecting
at
the
same
time
on
the
adroitness
that
every
animal
is
possessed
of
as
regards
the
of
itself
and
offspring
but
a
piece
of
address
which
they
show
when
they
return
loaded
should
not
i
think
be
passed
over
in
silence
as
they
take
their
prey
with
their
claws
so
they
carry
it
in
their
claws
to
their
nest
but
as
the
feet
are
necessary
in
their
ascent
under
the
tiles
they
constantly
perch
first
on
the
roof
of
the
chancel
and
shift
the
mouse
from
their
claws
to
their
bill
that
the
feet
may
be
at
liberty
to
take
hold
of
the
plate
on
the
wall
as
they
are
rising
under
the
eaves
white
owls
seem
not
but
in
this
i
am
not
positive
to
hoot
at
all
all
that
clamorous
hooting
appears
to
me
to
come
from
the
wood
kinds
the
white
owl
does
indeed
snore
and
hiss
in
a
tremendous
manner
and
these
menaces
well
answer
the
intention
of
intimidating
for
i
have
known
a
whole
village
up
in
arms
on
such
an
occasion
imagining
the
to
be
full
of
goblins
and
spectres
white
owls
also
often
scream
horribly
as
they
fly
along
from
this
screaming
probably
arose
the
common
imaginary
species
of
which
they
superstitiously
think
attends
the
windows
of
dying
persons
the
plumage
of
the
remiges
of
the
wings
of
every
species
of
owl
that
i
have
yet
examined
is
remarkably
soft
and
pliant
perhaps
it
may
be
necessary
that
the
wings
of
these
birds
should
not
make
much
resistance
or
rushing
that
they
may
be
enabled
to
steal
through
the
air
unheard
upon
a
nimble
and
watchful
quarry
while
i
am
talking
of
owls
it
may
not
be
improper
to
mention
what
i
was
told
by
a
gentleman
of
the
county
of
wilts
as
they
were
grubbing
a
vast
hollow
that
had
been
the
mansion
of
owls
for
centuries
he
discovered
at
the
bottom
a
mass
of
matter
that
at
first
he
could
not
account
for
after
examination
he
found
it
was
a
congeries
of
the
bones
of
mice
and
perhaps
of
birds
and
bats
that
had
been
heaping
together
for
ages
being
cast
up
in
pellets
out
of
the
crops
of
many
generations
of
inhabitants
for
owls
cast
up
the
bones
fur
and
feathers
of
what
they
devour
after
the
manner
of
hawks
he
believes
he
told
me
that
there
were
bushels
of
this
kind
of
substance
when
brown
owls
hoot
their
throats
swell
as
big
as
an
hen
egg
i
have
known
an
owl
of
this
species
live
a
full
year
without
any
water
perhaps
the
case
may
be
the
same
with
all
birds
of
prey
when
owls
fly
they
stretch
out
their
legs
behind
them
as
a
balance
to
their
large
heavy
heads
for
as
most
nocturnal
birds
have
large
eyes
and
ears
they
must
have
large
heads
to
contain
them
large
eyes
i
presume
are
necessary
to
collect
every
ray
of
light
and
large
concave
ears
to
command
the
smallest
degree
of
sound
or
noise
i
am
etc
the
hirundines
are
a
most
inoffensive
harmless
entertaining
social
and
useful
tribe
of
birds
they
touch
no
fruit
in
our
gardens
delight
all
except
one
species
in
attaching
themselves
to
our
houses
amuse
us
with
their
migrations
songs
and
marvellous
agility
and
clear
our
outlets
from
the
annoyances
of
gnats
and
other
troublesome
insects
some
districts
in
the
south
seas
near
guiaquil
are
desolated
it
seems
by
the
infinite
swarms
of
venomous
mosquitoes
which
fill
the
air
and
render
those
coasts
insupportable
it
would
be
worth
inquiring
whether
any
species
of
hirundines
is
found
in
those
regions
whoever
contemplates
the
myriads
of
insects
that
sport
in
the
sunbeams
of
a
summer
evening
in
this
country
will
soon
be
convinced
to
what
a
degree
our
atmosphere
would
be
choked
with
them
was
it
not
for
the
friendly
interposition
of
the
swallow
tribe
many
species
of
birds
have
their
particular
lice
but
the
hirundines
alone
seem
to
be
annoyed
with
dipterous
insects
which
infest
every
species
and
are
so
large
in
proportion
to
themselves
that
they
must
be
truly
irksome
and
injurious
to
them
these
are
the
hippoboscae
hirundinis
with
narrow
subulated
wings
abounding
in
every
nest
and
are
hatched
by
the
warmth
of
the
bird
own
body
during
incubation
and
crawl
about
under
its
feathers
a
species
of
them
is
familiar
to
horsemen
in
the
south
of
england
under
the
name
of
and
to
some
of
from
its
running
sideways
like
a
crab
it
creeps
under
the
tails
and
about
the
groins
of
horses
which
at
their
first
coming
out
of
the
north
are
rendered
half
frantic
by
the
tickling
sensation
while
our
own
breed
little
regards
them
the
curious
reaumur
discovered
the
large
eggs
or
rather
pupae
of
these
flies
as
big
as
the
flies
themselves
which
he
hatched
in
his
own
bosom
any
person
that
will
take
the
troupe
to
examine
the
old
nests
of
either
species
of
swallows
may
find
in
them
the
black
shining
cases
of
the
pupae
of
these
insects
but
for
other
particulars
too
long
for
this
place
we
refer
the
reader
to
of
that
admirable
entomologist
tom
iv
pi
ii
letter
xvi
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
dear
sir
in
obedience
to
your
injunctions
i
sit
down
to
give
you
some
account
of
the
or
martlet
and
if
my
monography
of
this
little
domestic
and
familiar
bird
should
happen
to
meet
with
your
approbation
i
may
probably
soon
extend
my
inquiries
to
the
rest
of
the
british
hirundines
the
swallow
the
swift
and
the
a
few
begin
to
appear
about
the
sixteenth
of
april
usually
some
few
days
later
than
the
swallow
for
some
time
after
they
appear
the
hirundines
in
general
pay
no
attention
to
the
business
of
nidification
but
play
and
sport
about
either
to
recruit
from
the
fatigue
of
their
journey
if
they
do
migrate
at
all
or
else
that
their
blood
may
recover
its
true
tone
and
texture
after
it
has
been
so
long
benumbed
by
the
severities
of
winter
about
the
middle
of
may
if
the
weather
be
fine
the
martin
begins
to
think
in
earnest
of
providing
a
mansion
for
its
family
the
crust
or
shell
of
this
nest
seems
to
be
formed
of
such
dirt
or
loam
as
comes
most
readily
to
hand
and
is
tempered
and
wrought
together
with
little
bits
of
broken
straws
to
render
it
tough
and
tenacious
as
this
bird
often
builds
against
a
perpendicular
wall
without
any
projecting
ledge
under
it
requires
its
utmost
efforts
to
get
the
first
foundation
firmly
fixed
so
that
it
may
safely
carry
the
superstructure
on
this
occasion
the
bird
not
only
clings
with
its
claws
but
partly
supports
itself
by
strongly
inclining
its
tail
against
the
wall
making
that
a
fulcrum
and
thus
steadied
it
works
and
plasters
the
materials
into
the
face
of
the
brick
or
stone
but
then
that
this
work
may
not
while
it
is
soft
and
green
pull
itself
down
by
its
own
weight
the
provident
architect
has
prudence
and
forbearance
enough
not
to
advance
her
work
too
fast
but
by
building
only
in
the
morning
and
by
dedicating
the
rest
of
the
day
to
food
and
amusement
gives
it
sufficient
time
to
dry
and
harden
about
half
an
inch
seems
to
be
a
sufficient
layer
for
a
day
thus
careful
workmen
when
they
build
informed
at
first
perhaps
by
this
lithe
bird
raise
but
a
moderate
layer
at
a
time
and
then
desist
lest
the
work
should
become
and
so
be
ruined
by
is
own
weight
by
this
method
in
about
ten
or
twelve
days
is
formed
an
hemispheric
nest
with
a
small
aperture
towards
the
top
strong
compact
and
warm
and
perfectly
fitted
for
all
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended
but
then
nothing
is
more
common
than
for
the
as
soon
as
the
shell
is
finished
to
seize
on
it
as
is
own
to
eject
the
owner
and
to
line
it
after
is
own
manner
after
so
much
labour
is
bestowed
in
erecting
a
mansion
as
nature
seldom
works
in
vain
martins
win
breed
on
for
several
years
together
in
the
same
nest
where
it
happens
to
be
well
sheltered
and
secure
from
the
injuries
of
weather
the
shed
or
crust
of
the
nest
is
a
sort
of
rustic
work
full
of
knobs
and
protuberances
on
the
outside
nor
is
the
inside
of
those
that
i
have
examined
smoothed
with
any
exactness
at
all
but
is
rendered
soft
and
warm
and
fit
for
incubation
by
a
lining
of
small
straws
grasses
and
feathers
and
sometimes
by
a
bed
of
moss
interwoven
with
wool
in
this
nest
they
tread
or
engender
frequently
during
the
time
of
building
and
the
hen
lays
from
three
to
five
white
eggs
at
first
when
the
young
are
hatched
and
are
in
a
naked
and
helpless
condition
the
parent
birds
with
tender
assiduity
carry
out
what
comes
away
from
their
young
was
it
not
for
this
affectionate
cleanliness
the
nestlings
would
soon
be
burnt
up
and
destroyed
in
so
deep
and
hollow
a
nest
by
their
own
caustic
excrement
in
the
quadruped
creation
the
same
neat
precaution
is
made
use
of
particularly
among
dogs
and
cats
where
the
dams
lick
away
what
proceeds
from
their
young
but
in
birds
there
seems
to
be
a
particular
provision
that
the
dung
of
nestlings
is
enveloped
into
a
tough
kind
of
jelly
and
therefore
is
the
easier
conveyed
off
without
soiling
or
daubing
yet
as
nature
is
cleanly
in
all
her
ways
the
young
perform
this
office
for
themselves
in
a
little
time
by
thrusting
their
tails
out
at
the
aperture
of
their
nest
as
the
young
of
small
birds
presently
arrive
at
their
elikia
in
greek
or
full
growth
they
soon
become
impatient
of
confinement
and
sit
all
day
with
their
heads
out
at
the
orifice
where
the
dams
by
clinging
to
the
nest
supply
them
with
food
from
morning
to
night
for
a
time
the
young
are
fed
on
the
wing
by
their
parents
but
the
feat
is
done
by
so
quick
and
almost
imperceptible
a
sleight
that
a
person
must
have
attended
very
exactly
to
their
motions
before
he
would
be
able
to
perceive
it
as
soon
as
the
young
are
able
to
shift
for
themselves
the
dams
immediately
turn
their
thoughts
to
the
business
of
a
second
brood
while
the
first
flight
shaken
off
and
rejected
by
their
nurses
congregate
in
great
flocks
and
are
the
birds
that
are
seen
clustering
and
hovering
on
sunny
mornings
and
evenings
round
towers
and
steeples
and
on
the
mobs
of
churches
and
houses
these
congregations
usually
begin
to
take
place
about
the
first
week
in
august
and
therefore
we
may
conclude
that
by
that
time
the
first
flight
is
pretty
well
over
the
young
of
this
species
do
not
quit
their
abodes
all
together
but
the
more
forward
birds
get
abroad
some
days
before
the
rest
these
approaching
the
eaves
of
buildings
and
playing
about
before
them
make
people
think
that
several
old
ones
attend
one
nest
they
are
often
capricious
in
fixing
on
a
nesting
place
beginning
many
edifices
and
leaving
them
unfinished
but
when
once
a
nest
is
completed
in
a
sheltered
place
it
serves
for
several
seasons
those
which
breed
in
a
ready
finished
house
get
the
start
in
hatching
of
those
that
build
new
by
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
these
industrious
artificers
are
at
their
labours
in
the
long
days
before
four
in
the
morning
when
they
fix
than
materials
they
plaster
them
on
with
their
chins
moving
their
heads
with
a
quick
vibratory
motion
they
dip
and
wash
as
they
fly
sometimes
in
very
hot
weather
but
not
so
frequency
as
swallows
it
has
been
observed
that
martins
usually
build
to
a
or
aspect
that
the
heat
of
the
sun
may
not
crack
and
destroy
their
nests
but
instances
are
also
remembered
where
they
bred
for
many
years
in
vast
abundance
in
an
hot
stifled
against
a
wall
facing
to
the
south
birds
in
general
are
wise
in
their
choice
of
situation
but
in
this
neighbourhood
every
summer
is
seen
a
strong
proof
to
the
contrary
at
an
house
without
eaves
in
an
exposed
district
where
some
martins
build
year
by
year
in
the
corners
of
the
windows
but
as
the
corners
of
these
windows
which
face
to
the
and
are
too
shallow
the
nests
are
washed
down
every
hard
rain
and
yet
these
birds
drudge
on
to
no
purpose
from
summer
to
summer
without
changing
their
aspect
or
house
it
is
a
piteous
sight
to
see
them
labouring
when
half
their
nest
is
washed
away
and
bringing
dirt
lapsi
sarcire
ruinas
thus
is
instinct
a
most
wonderful
unequal
faculty
in
some
instances
so
much
above
reason
in
other
respects
so
far
below
it
martins
love
to
frequent
towns
especially
if
there
are
great
lakes
and
rivers
at
hand
nay
they
even
affect
the
close
air
of
london
and
i
have
not
only
seen
them
nesting
in
the
borough
but
even
in
the
strand
and
street
but
then
it
was
obvious
from
the
dinginess
of
their
aspect
that
their
feathers
partook
of
the
filth
of
that
sooty
atmosphere
martins
are
by
far
the
least
agile
of
the
four
species
their
wings

tails
are
short
and
therefore
they
are
not
capable
of
such
surprising
turns
and
quick
and
glancing
evolutions
as
the
swallow
accordingly
they
make
use
of
a
placid
easy
motion
in
a
middle
region
of
the
air
seldom
mounting
to
any
great
height
and
never
sweeping
long
together
over
the
surface
of
the

or
water
they
do
not
wander
far
for

but
affect
sheltered
districts
over
some
lake
or
under
some
hanging
wood
or
in
some
hollow
vale
especially
in
windy
weather
they
breed
the
latest
of
all
the
swallow
kind
in
they
had
nestlings
on
to
october
the
first

are
never
without
unfledged

as
late
as
michaelmas
as
the
summer
declines
the
congregating
docks
increase
in
numbers
daily
by
the
constant
accession
of
the

at
last
they
swarm
in
myriads
upon
myriads
round
the
villages
on
the
thames
darkening
the
face
of
the
sky
as
they
frequent
the
aits
of
that
river
where
they
roost
they
retire
the
bulk
of
them
i
mean
in
vast
flocks
together
about
the
beginning
of
october
but
have
appeared
of
late
years
in
a
considerable
eight
in
this
neighbourhood
for
one
day

two
as
late
as
november
the
third
and
sixth
after
they
were
supposed
to
have
been
gone
for
more
than
a
fortnight
they
therefore
withdraw
with
us
the
latest
of
any
species
unless
these
birds
ate
very
indeed
or
unless
they
do
not
return
to
the
district
where
they
are
bred
they
must
undergo
vast
devastations
somehow
sad
somewhere
for
the
birds
that
return
yearly
bear
no
manner
of
proportion
to
the
birds
that
retire
ate

from

congeners
by
having
that
legs
coveted
with
soft

they

twitter

near

dear
sir
i
received
your
last
favour
just
as
i
was
setting
out
for
this
place
and
am
pleased
to
find
that
my
monography
met
with
your
approbation
my
remarks
are
the
result
of
many
years
observation
and
are
i
trust
true
on
the
whole
though
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
they
are
perfectly
void
of
mistake
or
that
a
more
nice
observer
ought
not
make
many
additions
since
subjects
of
this
kind
are
inexhaustible
if
you
think
my
letter
worthy
the
notice
of
your
respectable
society
you
are
at
liberty
to
lay
it
before
them
and
they
win
consider
it
i
hope
as
it
was
intended
as
an
humble
attempt
to
promote
a
more
minute
inquiry
into
natural
history
into
the
life
and
conversation
of
animals
perhaps
hereafter
i
may
be
induced
to
take
the
swallow
under
consideration
and
from
that
proceed
to
the
rest
of
the
british
hirundines
though
i
have
now
travelled
the
upwards
of
thirty
years
yet
i
still
investigate
that
chain
of
majestic
mountains
with
fresh
admiration
year
by
year
and
think
i
see
new
beauties
every
time
i
traverse
it
this
range
which
runs
from
chichester
eastward
as
far
as
is
about
sixty
miles
in
length
and
is
called
the
south
downs
properly
speaking
only
round
lewes
as
you
pass
along
you
command
a
noble
view
of
the
wild
or
weald
on
one
hand
and
the
broad
downs
and
sea
on
the
other
ray
used
to
visit
a
just
at
the
foot
of
these
hips
and
was
so
ravished
with
the
prospect
from
near
lewes
that
he
mentions
those
scopes
in
his
wisdom
of
god
in
the
works
of
the
creation
with
the
utmost
satisfaction
and
thinks
them
equal
to
anything
he
had
seen
in
the
finest
parts
of
europe
courthope
of
danny
for
my
own
part
i
think
there
is
somewhat
peculiarly
sweet
and
amusing
in
the
shapely
figured
aspect
of
in
preference
to
those
of
stone
which
are
rugged
broken
abrupt
and
shapeless
perhaps
i
may
be
singular
in
my
opinion
and
not
so
happy
as
to
convey
to
you
the
same
idea
but
i
never
contemplate
these
mountains
without
thinking
i
perceive
somewhat
analogous
to
growth
in
their
gentle
swellings
and
smooch
protuberances
their
fluted
sides
and
regular
hollows
and
slopes
that
carry
at
once
the
air
of
vegetative
dilation
and
expansion
or
was
there
ever
a
time
when
these
immense
masses
of
calcareous
matter
were
drown
into
fermentation
by
some
adventitious
moisture
were
raised
and
leavened
into
such
shapes
by
some
plastic
power
and
so
made
to
swell
and
heave
their
broad
backs
into
the
sky
so
much
above
the
less
animated
clay
of
the
wild
below
by
what
i
can
guess
from
the
admeasurements
of
the
hills
that
have
been
taken
round
my
house
i
should
suppose
that
these
hills
surmount
the
wild
at
au
average
at
about
the
rate
of
five
hundred
feet
one
thing
is
very
remarkable
as
to
the
sheep
from
the
westward
till
you
get
to
the
river
adur
all
the
flocks
have
horns
and
smooth
white
faces
and
white
legs
and
a
hornless
sheep
is
rarely
to
be
seen
but
as
soon
as
you
pass
the
river
eastward
and
mount
all
the
flocks
at
once
become
hornless
or
as
they
call
them
and
have
moreover
black
faces
with
a
white
tuft
of
wool
on
their
foreheads
and
speckled
and
spotted
legs
so
that
you
would
think
that
the
flocks
of
laban
were
pasturing
on
one
side
of
the
stream
and
the
variegated
breed
of
his
jacob
were
cantoned
along
on
the
other
and
this
diversity
holds
good
respectively
on
each
side
from
the
valley
of
bramber
and
beeding
to
the
eastward
and
westward
all
the
whole
length
of
the
downs
if
you
talk
with
the
shepherds
on
this
subject
they
tell
you
that
the
case
has
been
so
from
time
immemorial
and
smile
at
your
simplicity
if
you
ask
them
whether
the
situation
of
these
two
different
breeds
might
not
be
reversed
however
an
intelligent
friend
of
mine
near
chichester
is
determined
to
try
the
experiment
and
has
this
autumn
at
the
hazard
of
being
laughed
at
introduced
a
parcel
of
hornless
rams
among
his
horned
western
ewes
the
have
the
shortest
legs
and
the
finest
wool
as
i
had
hardly
ever
before
travelled
these
downs
at
so
late
a
season
of
the
year
i
was
determined
to
keep
as
sharp
a
as
possible
so
near
the
southern
coast
with
respect
to
the
summer
birds
of
passage
we
make
great
inquiries
concerning
the
withdrawing
of
the
swallow
kind
without
examining
enough
into
the
causes
why
this
tribe
is
never
to
be
seen
in
winter
for
entre
nous
the
disappearing
of
the
latter
is
more
marvellous
than
that
of
the
former
and
much
more
unaccountable
the
hirundines
if
they
please
are
certainly
capable
of
migration
and
yet
no
doubt
are
often
found
in
a
torpid
state
but
redstarts
nightingales
throats
are
very
ill
provided
for
long
flights
have
never
been
once
found
as
i
ever
heard
of
in
a
torpid
state
and
yet
can
never
be
supposed
in
such
troops
from
year
to
year
to
dodge
and
elude
the
eyes
of
the
curious
and
inquisitive
which
from
day
to
day
discern
the
other
small
birds
that
are
known
to
abide
our
winters
but
notwithstanding
all
my
care
i
saw
nothing
like
a
summer
bird
of
passage
and
what
is
more
strange
not
one
though
they
abound
so
in
the
autumn
as
to
be
a
considerable
perquisite
to
the
shepherds
that
take
them
and
though
many
are
to
be
seen
to
my
knowledge
all
the
winter
through
in
many
parts
of
the
south
of
england
the
most
intelligent
shepherds
tell
me
that
some
few
of
these
birds
appear
on
the
downs
in
march
and
then
withdraw
to
breed
probably
in
warrens
and
now
and
then
a
nest
is
plowed
up
in
a
fallow
on
the
downs
under
a
furrow
but
it
is
thought
a
rarity
at
the
time
of
they
begin
to
be
taken
in
great
numbers
are
sent
for
sale
in
vast
quantities
to
brighthelmstone
and
tunbridge
and
appear
at
the
tables
of
all
the
gentry
that
entertain
with
any
degree
of
elegance
about
michaelmas
they
retire
and
are
seen
no
more
till
march
though
these
birds
are
when
in
season
in
great
plenty
on
the
south
downs
round
lewes
yet
at
which
is
the
eastern
extremity
of
those
downs
they
abound
much
more
one
thing
is
very
remarkable
that
though
in
the
height
of
the
season
so
many
hundreds
of
dozens
are
taken
yet
they
never
are
seen
to
flock
and
it
is
a
rare
thing
to
see
more
than
three
or
four
at
a
time
so
that
there
must
be
a
perpetual
flitting
and
constant
progressive
succession
it
does
not
appear
that
any
are
taken
to
the
westward
of
which
stands
on
the
river
arun
i
did
not
fail
to
look
particularly
after
my
new
migration
of
ousels
and
to
take
notice
whether
they
continued
on
the
downs
to
this
season
of
the
year
as
i
had
formerly
remarked
them
in
the
month
of
october
all
the
way
from
chichester
to
lewes
wherever
there
were
any
shrubs
and
covert
but
not
one
bird
of
this
sort
came
within
my
observation
i
only
saw
a
few
larks
and
some
rooks
and
several
kites
and
buzzards
about
midsummer
a
flight
of
comes
to
the
about
this
house
but
never
makes
any
long
stay
the
old
tortoise
that
i
have
mentioned
in
a
former
letter
still
continues
in
this
garden
and
retired
under
ground
about
the
twentieth
of
november
and
came
out
again
for
one
day
on
the
thirtieth
it
lies
now
buried
in
a
wet
swampy
border
under
a
wall
facing
to
the
south
and
is
enveloped
at
present
in
mud
and
mire
here
is
a
large
rookery
round
this
house
the
inhabitants
of
which
seem
to
get
their
livelihood
very
easily
for
they
spend
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
on
their
when
the
weather
is
mild
these
rooks
retire
every
evening
all
the
winter
from
this
rookery
where
they
only
call
by
the
way
as
they
are
going
to
roost
in
deep
woods
at
the
dawn
of
day
they
always
revisit
their
and
are
preceded
a
few
minutes
by
a
flight
of
daws
that
act
as
it
were
as
their
harbingers

letter
xviii
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
dear
sir
the
or
is
undoubtedly
the
first
comer
of
all
the
british
hirundines
and
appears
in
general
on
or
about
the
thirteenth
of
april
as
i
have
remarked
from
many
observation
not
but
now
and
then
a
straggler
is
seen
much
earlier
and
in
particular
when
i
was
a
boy
i
observed
a
swallow
for
a
whole
day
together
on
a
sunny
warm
shrove
tuesday
which
day
could
not
fall
out
later
than
the
middle
of
march
and
often
happened
early
in
february
it
is
worth
remarking
that
these
birds
are
seen
first
about
lakes
and
and
it
is
also
very
particular
that
if
these
early
visitors
happen
to
find
frost
and
snow
as
was
the
case
of
the
two
dreadful
springs
of
and
they
immediately
withdraw
for
a
time
a
circumstance
this
much
more
in
favour
of
hiding
than
migration
since
it
is
much
more
probable
that
a
bird
should
retire
to
its
hybernaculum
just
at
hand
than
return
for
a
week
or
two
only
to
warmer
latitudes
the
swallow
though
called
the
by
no
means
builds
altogether
in
chimneys
but
often
within
barns
and
houses
against
the
rafters
and
so
she
did
in
virgil
time
ante
garrulla
quam
tignis

she
builds

and

the
swallow
besides
in
the
warmer
parts
of
europe
there
are
no
chimneys
to
houses
except
they
are
in
these
countries
she
constructs
her
nest
in
porches
and
gateways
and
galleries
and
open
halls
here
and
there
a
bird
may
affect
some
odd
peculiar
place
as
we
have
known
a
swallow
build
down
the
shaft
of
an
old
well
through
which
chalk
had
been
formerly
drawn
up
for
the
purpose
of
manure
but
in
general
with
us
this
hirundo
breeds
in
chimneys
and
loves
to
haunt
those
stacks
where
there
is
a
constant
fire
no
doubt
for
the
sake
of
warmth
not
that
it
can
subsist
in
the
immediate
shaft
where
there
is
a
fire
but
prefers
one
adjoining
to
that
of
the
kitchen
and
disregards
the
perpetual
smoke
of
that
funnel
as
i
have
often
observed
with
some
degree
of
wonder
five
or
six
or
more
feet
down
the
chimney
does
this
little
bird
begin
to
form
her
nest
about
the
middle
of
may
which
consists
like
that
of
the
of
a
crust
or
shell
composed
of
dirt
or
mud
mixed
with
short
pieces
of
straw
to
render
it
tough
and
permanent
with
this
difference
that
whereas
the
shell
of
the
martin
is
nearly
hemispheric
that
of
the
swallow
is
open
at
the
top
and
like
half
a
deep
dish
this
nest
is
lined
with
fine
grasses
and
feathers
which
are
often
collected
as
they
float
in
the
air
wonderful
is
the
address
which
this
adroit
bird
shows
all
day
long
in
ascending
and
descending
with
security
through
so
narrow
a
pass
when
hovering
over
the
mouth
of
the
funnel
the
vibrations
of
her
wings
acting
on
the
confined
air
occasion
a
rumbling
like
thunder
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
dam
submits
to
this
inconvenient
situation
so
low
in
the
shaft
in
order
to
secure
her
broods
from
rapacious
birds
and
particularly
from
owls
which
frequently
fall
down
chimneys
perhaps
in
attempting
to
get
at
these
nestlings
the
swallow
lays
from
four
to
six
white
eggs
dotted
with
red
specks
and
brings
out
her
first
brood
about
the
last
week
in
june
or
the
first
week
in
july
the
progressive
method
by
which
the
young
are
introduced
into
life
is
very
amusing
first
they
emerge
from
the
shaft
with
difficulty
enough
and
often
fall
down
into
the
rooms
below
for
a
day
or
so
they
are
fed
on
the
and
then
are
conducted
to
the
dead
leafless
bough
of
some
tree
where
sitting
in
a
row
they
are
attended
with
great
assiduity
and
may
then
be
called
perchers
in
a
day
or
two
more
they
become
flyers
but
are
still
unable
to
take
their
own
food
therefore
they
play
about
near
the
place
where
the
dams
are
hawking
for
flies
and
when
a
mouthful
is
collected
at
a
certain
signal
given
the
dam
and
the
nestling
advance
rising
towards
each
other
and
meeting
at
an
angle
the
young
one
all
the
while
uttering
such
a
little
quick
note
of
gratitude
and
complacency
that
a
person
must
have
paid
very
little
regard
to
the
wonders
of
nature
that
has
not
often
remarked
this
feat
the
dam
betakes
herself
immediately
to
the
business
of
a
second
brood
as
soon
as
she
is
disengaged
from
her
first
which
at
once
associates
with
the
first
broods
of
and
with
them
congregates
clustering
on
sunny
roofs
towers
and
trees
this
hirundo
brings
out
her
second
brood
towards
the
middle
and
end
of
august
all
the
summer
long
is
the
swallow
a
most
instructive
pattern
of
unwearied
industry
and
affection
for
from
morning
to
night
while
there
is
a
family
to
be
supported
she
spends
the
whole
day
in
skimming
close
to
the
ground
and
exerting
the
most
sudden
turns
and
quick
evolutions
avenues
and
long
walks
under
hedges
and
and
mown
meadows
where
cattle
graze
are
her
delight
especially
if
there
are
trees
interspersed
because
in
such
spots
insects
most
abound
when
a
fly
is
taken
a
smart
snap
from
her
bill
is
heard
resembling
the
noise
at
the
shutting
of
a
case
but
the
motion
of
the
mandibles
are
too
quick
for
the
eye
the
swallow
probably
the
male
bird
is
the
excubitor
to
martins
and
other
little
birds
announcing
the
approach
of
birds
of
prey
for

both

excursions
over

horsemen
on
wide
downs

often
closely
attended
by
a
little
party
of
swallows
for
miles
together
which
plays
before
and
behind
them
sweeping
around
and
collecting
all
the
skulking
insects

are
roused
by
the
trampling
of

feet
when
the
wind
blows
hard
without
this
expedient
they
are
often
forced
to

to
pick
up
their
lurking
prey
this
species
feeds
much
on
little
coleoptera
as
well
as
on
gnats
and
flies
and
often
settles
on
dug
ground
or
paths
for
gravels

food
before
they
depart

some

forsake

and
chimneys

roost
in
trees

usually
withdraw
about
the
beginning
of
october

some
few
stragglers
may
appear
on
at
times
till
the
first
week
in
november
some
few
pairs
haunt
the
new
and
open
streets
of
london
next
the
fields
but
do
not
enter
like
the
the
close
and
crowded
parts
of
the
city
both
male
and
female
are
distinguished
from
their
congeners
by
the
length
and
forkedness
of
their
tails
they
are
undoubtedly
the
most
nimble
of
all
the
species
and
when
the
male
pursues
the
female
in
amorous
chase
they
then
go
beyond
their
usual
speed
and
exert
a
rapidity
almost
too
quick

the
eye
to
follow
after
this
circumstantial
detail
of
the
life
and
discerning
otorge
in
greek
of
the
swallow
i
shall
add
for
your
farther
amusement
an
anecdote
or
two
not
much
in
favour
of
her
sagacity
a
certain
swallow
built
for
two
years
together
on
the
handles
of
a
pair
of
that
were
stuck
up
against
the
boards
in
an
and
therefore
must
have
her
nest
spoiled
whenever
that
implement
was
wanted
and
what
is
stranger
still
another
bird
of
the
same
species
built
its
nest
on
the
wings
and
body
of
an
owl
that
happened
by
accident
to
hang
dead
and
dry
from
the
rafter
of
a
barn
this
owl
with
the
nest
on
its
wings
and
with
eggs
in
the
nest
was
brought
as
a
curiosity
worthy
the
most
elegant
private
museum
in
great
britain
the
owner
struck
with
the
oddity
of
the
sight
furnished
the
bringer
with
a
large
shell
or
conch
desiring
him
to
fix
it
just
where
the
owl
hung
the
person
did
as
he
was
ordered
and
the
following
year
a
pair
probably
the
same
pair
built
their
nest
in
the
conch
and
laid
their
eggs
the
owl
and
the
conch
make
a
strange
grotesque
appearance
and
are
not
the
least
curious
specimens
in
that
wonderful
collection
of
art
and
nature
sir

thus
is
instinct
in

taken
the
least
out
of

an
undistinguishing
limited

and
blind
to
every
circumstance
that
does

letter
xix
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
dear
sir
i
received
your
favour
of
the
eighth
and
am
pleased
to
find
that
you
read
my
little
history
of
the
swallow
with
your
usual
candour
nor
was
i
less
pleased
to
find
that
you
made
objections
where
you
saw
reason
as
to
the
quotations
it
is
difficult
to
say
precisely
which
species
of
hirundo
virgil
might
intend
in
the
lines
in
question
since
the
ancients
did
not
attend
to
specific
differences
like
modern
naturalists
yet
somewhat
may
be
gathered
enough
to
incline
me
to
suppose
that
in
the
two
passages
quoted
the
poet
had
his
eye
on
the
swallow
in
the
first
place
the
epithet
garrula
suits
the
swallow
well
who
is
a
great
songster
but
not
the
martin
which
is
rather
a
mute
bird
and
when
it
sings
is
so
inward
as
scarce
to
be
heard
besides
if
tignum
in
that
place
signifies
a
rafter
rather
than
a
beam
as
it
seems
to
me
to
do
then
i
think
it
must
be
the
swallow
that
is
alluded
to
and
not
the
martin
since
the
former
does
frequently
build
within
the
roof
against
the
rafters
while
the
latter
always
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
builds
without
the
roof
against
eaves
and
cornices
as
to
the
simile
too
much
stress
must
not
be
laid
on
it
yet
the
epithet
nigra
speaks
plainly
in
favour
of
the
swallow
whose
back
and
wings
are
very
black
while
the
rump
of
the
martin
is
white
its
back
and
wings
blue
and
all
its
under
part
white
as
snow
nor
can
the
clumsy
motions
comparatively
clumsy
of
the
martin
well
represent
the
sudden
and
artful
evolutions
and
quick
turns
which
juturna
gave
to
her
brother
chariot
so
as
to
elude
the
eager
pursuit
of
the
enraged
aeneas
the
verb
sonat
also
seems
to
imply
a
bird
that
is

loquacious

to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
dear
sir
the
or
is
by
much
the
least
of
any
of
the
british
hirundines
and
as
far
as
we
have
ever
seen
the
smallest
known
hirundo
though
brisson
asserts
that
there
is
one
much
smaller
and
that
is
the
hirundo
esculenta
but
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
it
is
scarce
possible
for
any
observer
to
be
so
full
and
exact
as
he
could
wish
in
reciting
the
circumstances
attending
the
life
and
conversation
of
this
little
bird
since
it
is
fera
natura
at
least
in
this
part
of
the
kingdom
disclaiming
all
domestic
attachments
and
haunting
wild
heaths
and
commons
where
there
are
large
lakes
while
the
other
species
especially
the
swallow
and
are
remarkably
gentle
and
domesticated
and
never
seem
to
think
themselves
safe
but
under
the
protection
of
man
here
are
in
this
parish
in
the
and
banks
of
the
lakes
of
several
colonies
of
these
birds
and
yet
they
are
never
seen
in
the
village
nor
do
they
at
all
frequent
the
cottages
that
are
scattered
about
in
that
wild
district
the
only
instance
i
ever
remember
where
this
species
haunts
any
building
is
at
the
town
of
bishop
waltham
in
this
county
where
many
martins
nestle
and
breed
in
the
of
the
of
william
of
wykeham
stables
but
then
this
wall
stands
in
a
very
sequestered
and
retired
enclosure
and
faces
upon
a
large
and
beautiful
lake
and
indeed
this
species
seems
so
to
delight
in
large
waters
that
no
instance
occurs
of
their
abounding
but
near
vast
pools
or
rivers
and
in
particular
it
has
been
remarked
that
they
swarm
in
the
banks
of
the
thames
in
some
places
below
bridge
it
is
curious
to
observe
with
what
different
degrees
of
architectonic
skill
providence
has
endowed
birds
of
the
same
genus
and
so
nearly
correspondent
in
their
general
mode
of
life
for
while
the
swallow
and
the
discover
the
greatest
address
in
raising
and
securely
fixing
crusts
or
shells
of
loam

for
their
young
the
terebrates
a
round
and
regular

in
the
sand
or
earth
which
is
serpentine
horizontal
and
about
two
feet
deep
at
the
inner
end
of
this
burrow
does
this
bird
deposit
in
a
good
degree
of
safety
her
rude
nest
consisting
of
fine
grasses
and
feathers
usually
very
inartificially
laid
together
perseverance
will
accomplish
anything
though
at
first
one
would
be
disinclined
to
believe
that
this
weak
bird
with
her
soft
and
tender
bill
and
claws
should
ever
be
able
to
bore
the
stubborn
without
entirely
disabling
herself
yet
with
these
feeble
instruments
have
i
seen
a
pair
of
them
make
great
dispatch
and
could
remark
how
much
they
had
scooped
that
day
by
the
fresh
sand
which
ran
down
the
bank
and
was
of
a
different
colour
from
that
which
lay
loose
and
bleached
in
the
sun
in
what
space
of
time
these
little
artists
are
able
to
mine
and
finish
these
cavities
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
for
reasons
given
above
but
it
would
be
a
matter
worthy
of
observation
where
it
falls
in
the
way
of
any
naturalist
to
make
his
remarks
this
i
have
often
taken
notice
of
that
several
holes
of
different
depths
are
left
unfinished
at
the
end
of
summer
to
imagine
that
these
beginnings
were
intentionally
made
in
order
to
be
in
the
greater
forwardness
for
next
spring
is
allowing
perhaps
too
much
foresight
and
rerum
prudentia
to
a
simple
bird
may
not
the
cause
of
these
latebrae
being
left
unfinished
arise
from
their
meeting
in
those
places
with
strata
too
harsh
hard
and
solid
for
their
purpose
which
they
relinquish
and
go
to
a
fresh
spot
that
works
more
freely
or
may
they
not
in
other
places
fall
in
with
a
soil
as
much
too
loose
and
mouldering
liable
to
flounder
and
threatening
to
overwhelm
them
and
their
labours
one
thing
is
remarkable
that
after
some
years
the
old
holes
are
forsaken
and
new
ones
bored
perhaps
because
the
old
habitations
grow
foul
and
fetid
from
long
use
or
because
they
may
so
abound
with
fleas
as
to
become
untenable
this
species
of
swallow
moreover
is
strangely
annoyed
with
fleas
and
we
have
seen
fleas
pulex
irritans
swarming
at
the
mouths
of
these
holes
like
bees
upon
the
stools
of
their
hives
the
following
circumstance
should
by
no
means
be
omitted
that
these
birds
do
not
make
use
of
their
caverns
by
way
of
hybernacula
as
might
be
expected
since
banks
so
perforated
have
been
dug
out
with
care
in
the
winter
when
nothing
was
found
but
empty
nests
the
arrives
much
about
the
same
time
with
the
swallow
and
lays
as
she
does
from
four
to
six
white
eggs
but
as
the
species
is
cryptogame
carrying
on
the
business
of
nidification
incubation
and
the
support
of
its
young
in
the
dark
it
would
not
be
so
easy
to
ascertain
the
time
of
breeding
were
it
not
for
the
coming
forth
of
the
broods
which
appear
much
about
the
time
or
rather
somewhat
earlier
than
those
of
the
swallow
the
nestlings
are
supported
in
common
like
those
of
their
congeners
with
gnats
and
other
small
insects
and
sometimes
they
are
fed
with
libellulae
almost
as
long
as
themselves
in
the
last
week
in
june
we
have
seen
a
row
of
these
sitting
on
a
rail
near
a
great
pool
as
perchers
and
so
young
and
helpless
as
easily
to
be
taken
by
hand
but
whether
the
dams
ever
feed
them
on
the
wing
as
swallows
and
do
we
have
never
yet
been
able
to
determine
nor
do
we
know
whether
they
pursue
and
attack
birds
of
prey
when
they
happen
to
breed
near
hedges
and
enclosures
they
are
dispossessed
of
their
breeding
holes
by
the
which
is
on
the
same
account
a
fell
adversary
to
these
hirundines
are
no
songsters
but
rather
mute
making
only
a
little
harsh
noise
when
a
person
approaches
their
nests
they
seem
not
to
be
of
a
sociable
turn
never
with
us
congregating
with
their
congeners
in
the
autumn
undoubtedly
they
breed
a
second
time
like
the
and
swallow
and
withdraw
about
michaelmas
though
in
some
particular
districts
they
may
happen
to
abound
yet
in
the
whole
in
the
south
of
england
at
least
is
this
much
the
rarest
species
for
there
are
few
towns
or
large
villages
but
what
abound
with
few
churches
towers
or
steeples
but
what
are
haunted
by
some
swifts
scarce
a
hamlet
or
single
chimney
that
has
not
its
swallow
while
the
scattered
here
and
there
live
a
sequestered
life
among
some
abrupt
hills
and
in
the
banks
of
some
few
rivers
these
birds
have
a
peculiar
manner
of
flying
flitting
about
with
odd
jerks
and
vacillations
not
unlike
the
motions
of
a
butterfly
doubtless
the
flight
of
all
hirundines
is
influenced
by
and
adapted
to
the
peculiar
sort
of
insects
which
furnish
their
food
hence
it
would
be
worth
inquiry
to
examine
what
particular
group
of
insects
affords
the
principal
food
of
each
respective
species
of
swallow
notwithstanding
what
has
been
advanced
above
some
few
martins
i
see
haunt
the
skirts
of
london
frequenting
the
dirty
pools
in
saint
and
about
the
question
is
where
these
build
since
there
are
no
banks
or
bold
shores
in
that
neighbourhood
perhaps
they
nestle
in
the
holes
of
some
old
or
new
deserted
building
they
dip
and
wash
as
they
fly
sometimes
like
the
and
swallow
differ
from
their
congeners
in
the
diminutiveness
of
their
size
and
in
their
colour
which
is
what
is
usually
called

sometimes
usurp
upon
the
and
expel
them
as
sparrows
do
the
house
and
well
remembering
that
i
have
seen
them
squabbling
together
at
the
entrance
of
their
holes
and
the
sparrows
up
in
arms
and
much
disconcerted
at
these
intruders
and
yet
i
am
assured
by
a
nice
observer
in
such
matters
that
they
do
collect
feathers
for
their
nests
in
andalusia
and
that
he
has
shot
them
with
such
materials
in
their
mouths
swifts
like
carry
on
the
business
of
nidification
quite
in
the
dark
in
crannies
of
castles
and
towers
and
steeples
and
upon
the
tops
of
the
walls
of
churches
under
the
roof
and
therefore
can
not
be
so
narrowly
watched
as
those
species
that
build
more
openly
but
from
what
i
could
ever
observe
they
begin
nesting
about
the
middle
of
may
and
i
have
remarked
from
eggs
taken
that
they
have
sat
hard
by
the
ninth
of
june
in
general
they
haunt
tall
buildings
churches
and
steeples
and
breed
only
in
such
yet
in
this
village
some
pairs
frequent
the
lowest
and
meanest
cottages
and
educate
their
young
under
those
thatched
roofs
we
remember
but
one
instance
where
they
breed
out
of
buildings
and
that
is
in
the
sides
of
a
deep
near
the
town
of
odiham
in
this
county
where
we
have
seen
many
pairs
entering
the
crevices
and
skimming
and
squeaking
round
the
precipices
as
i
have
regarded
these
amusive
birds
with
no
small
attention
if
i
should
advance
something
new
and
peculiar
with
respect
to
them
and
different
from
all
other
birds
i
might
perhaps
be
credited
especially
as
my
assertion
is
the
result
of
many
years
exact
observation
the
fact
that
i
would
advance
is
that
swifts
tread
or
copulate
on
the
wing
and
i
would
wish
any
nice
observer
that
is
startled
at
this
supposition
to
use
his
own
eyes
and
i
think
he
will
soon
be
convinced
in
another
class
of
animals
the
insect
nothing
is
so
common
as
to
see
the
different
species
of
many
genera
in
conjunction
as
they
fly
the
swift
is
almost
continually
on
the
wing
and
as
it
never
settles
on
the
ground
on
trees
or
roofs
would
seldom
find
opportunity
for
amorous
rites
was
it
not
enabled
to
indulge
them
in
the
air
if
any
person
would
watch
these
birds
of
a
fine
morning
in
may
as
they
are
sailing
round
at
a
great
height
from
the
ground
he
would
see
every
now
and
then
one
drop
on
the
back
of
another
and
both
of
them
sink
down
together
for
many
fathoms
with
a
loud
piercing
shriek
this
i
take
to
be
the
juncture
when
the
business
of
generation
is
carrying
on
as
the
swift
eats
drinks
collects
materials
for
its
nest
and
at
it
seems
propagates
on
the
wing
it
appears
to
live
more
in
the
air
than
any
other
bird
and
to
perform
all
functions
there
save
those
of
sleeping
and
incubation
this
hirundo
differs
widely
from
its
congeners
in
laying
invariably
but
two
eggs
at
a
time
which
are
long
and
peaked
at
the
small
end
whereas
the
other
species
lay
at
each
brood
from
four
to
six
it
is
a
most
alert
bird
rising
very
early
and
retiring
to
roost
very
late
and
is
on
the
wing
in
the
height
of
summer
at
least
sixteen
hours
in
the
longest
days
it
does
not
withdraw
to
rest
till
a
quarter
before
nine
in
the
evening
being
the
latest
of
all
day
birds
just
before
they
retire
whole
groups
of
them
assemble
high
in
the
air
and
squeak
and
shoot
about
with
wonderful
rapidity
but
this
bird
is
never
so
much
alive
as
in
sultry
thundry
weather
when
it
expresses
great
alacrity
and
calls
forth
all
its
powers
in
hot
mornings
several
getting
together
in
little
parties
dash
round
the
steeples
and
churches
squeaking
as
they
go
in
a
very
clamorous
manner
these
by
nice
observers
are
supposed
to
be
males
serenading
their
sitting
hens
and
not
without
reason
since
they
seldom
squeak
till
they
come
close
to
the
walls
or
eaves
and
since
those
within
utter
at
the
same
time
a
little
inward
note
of
complacency
when
the
hen
has
sat
hard
all
day
she
rushes
forth
just
as
it
is
almost
dark
and
stretches
and
relieves
her
weary
limbs
and
snatches
a
scanty
meal
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
returns
to
her
duty
of
incubation
swifts
when
wantonly
and
cruelly
shot
while
they
have
young
discover
a
little
lump
of
insects
in
their
mouths
which
they
pouch
and
hold
under
their
tongue
in
general
they
feed
in
a
much
higher
district
than
the
other
species
a
proof
that
gnats
and
other
insects
do
also
abound
to
a
considerable
height
in
the
air
they
also
range
to
vast
distances
since
locomotion
is
no
labour
to
them
who
are
endowed
with
such
wonderful
powers
of
wing
their
powers
seem
to
be
in
proportion
to
their
levers
and
their
wings
are
longer
in
proportion
than
those
of
almost
any
other
bird
when
they
mute
or
ease
themselves
in
flight
they
raise
their
wings
and
make
them
meet
over
their
backs
at
some
certain
times
in
the
summer
i
had
remarked
that
swifts
were
hawking
very
low
for
hours
together
over
pools
and
streams
and
could
not
help
inquiring
into
the
object
of
their
pursuit
that
induced
them
to
descend
so
much
below
their
usual
range
after
some
trouble
i
found
that
they
were
taking
phryganeae
ephemerae
and
libellulae
and
flies
that
were
just
emerged
out
of
their
aurelia
state
i
then
no
longer
wondered
that
they
should
be
so
willing
to
stoop
for
a
prey
that
afforded
them
such
plentiful
and
succulent
nourishment
they
bring
out
their
young
about
the
middle
or
latter
end
of
july
but
as
these
never
become
perchers
nor
that
ever
i
could
discern
are
fed
on
the
wing
by
their
dams
the
coming
forth
of
the
young
is
not
so
notorious
as
in
the
other
species
on
the
thirtieth
of
last
june
i
untiled
the
eaves
of
an
house
where
many
pairs
build
and
found
in
each
nest
only
two
squab
naked
pulli
on
the
eighth
of
july
i
repeated
the
same
inquiry
and
found
they
had
made
very
little
progress
towards
a
fledged
state
but
were
still
naked
and
helpless
from
whence
we
may
conclude
that
birds
whose
way
of
life
keeps
them
perpetually
on
the
wing
would
not
be
able
to
quit
their
nest
till
the
end
of
the
month
swallows
and
martins
that
have
numerous
families
are
continually
feeding
them
every
two
or
three
minutes
while
swifts
that
have
but
two
young
to
maintain
are
much
at
their
leisure
and
do
not
attend
on
their
nests
for
hours
together
sometimes
they
pursue
and
strike
at
hawks
that
come
in
their
way
but
not
with
that
vehemence
and
fury
that
swallows
express
on
the
same
occasion
they
are
out
all
day
long
in
wet
days
feeding
about
and
disregarding
still
rain
from
whence
two
things
may
be
gathered
first
that
many
insects
abide
high
in
the
air
even
in
rain
and
next
that
the
feathers
of
these
birds
must
be
well
preened
to
resist
so
much
wet
windy
and
particularly
windy
weather
with
heavy
showers
they
dislike
and
on
such
days
withdraw
and
are
scarce
ever
seen
there
is
a
circumstance
respecting
the
colour
of
swifts
which
seems
not
to
be
unworthy
our
attention
when
they
arrive
in
the
spring
they
are
all
over
of
a
glossy
dark
except
their
chins
which
are
white
but
by
being
all
day
long
in
the
sun
and
air
they
become
quite
and
bleached
before
they
depart
and
yet
they
return
glossy
again
in
the
spring
now
if
they
pursue
the
sun
into
lower
latitudes
as
some
suppose
in
order
to
enjoy
a
perpetual
summer
why
do
they
not
return
bleached
do
they
not
rather
perhaps
retire
to
rest
for
a
season
and
at
that
juncture
moult
and
change
their
feathers
since
all
other
birds
are
known
to
moult
soon
after
the
season
of
breeding
swifts
are
very
anomalous
in
many
particulars
dissenting
from
all
their
congeners
not
only
in
the
number
of
their
young
but
in
breeding
but
once
in
a
summer
whereas
all
the
other
british
hirundines
breed
invariably
twice
it
is
past
all
doubt
that
swifts
can
breed
but
once
since
they
withdraw
in
a
short
time
after
the
flight
of
their
young
and
some
time
before
their
congeners
bring
out
their
second
brood
we
may
here
remark
that
as
swifts
breed
but
once
in
a
summer
and
only
two
at
a
time
and
the
other
hirundines
twice
the
latter
who
lay
from
four
to
six
eggs
increase
at
an
average
five
times
as
fast
as
the
former
but
in
nothing
are
swifts
more
singular
than
in
their
early
retreat
they
retire
as
to
the
main
body
of
them
by
the
tenth
of
august
and
sometimes
a
few
days
sooner
and
every
straggler
invariably
withdraws
by
the
twentieth
while
their
congeners
all
of
them
stay
till
the
beginning
of
october
many
of
them
all
through
that
month
and
some
occasionally
to
the
beginning
of
november
this
early
retreat
is
mysterious
and
wonderful
since
that
time
is
often
the
sweetest
season
in
the
year
but
what
is
more
extraordinary
they
begin
to
retire
still
earlier
in
the
most
southerly
parts
of
andalusia
where
they
can
be
no
ways
influenced
by
any
defect
of
heat
or
as
one
might
suppose
defect
of
food
are
they
regulated
in
their
motions
with
us
by
a
failure
of
food
or
by
a
propensity
to
moulting
or
by
a
disposition
to
rest
after
so
rapid
a
life
or
by
what
this
is
one
of
those
incidents
in
natural
history
that
not
only
baffles
our
searches
but
almost
eludes
our
guesses
these
hirundines
never
perch
on
trees
or
roofs
and
so
never
congregate
with
their
congeners
they
are
fearless
while
haunting
their
nesting
places
and
are
not
to
be
scared
with
a
gun
and
are
often
beaten
down
with
poles
and
cudgels
as
they
stoop
to
go
under
the
eaves
swifts
are
much
infested
with
those
pests
to
the
genus
called
hippoboscae
hirundinis
and
often
wriggle
and
scratch
themselves
in
their
flight
to
get
rid
of
that
clinging
annoyance
swifts
are
no
songsters
and
have
only
one
harsh
screaming
note
yet
there
are
ears
to
which
it
is
not
displeasing
from
an
agreeable
association
of
ideas
since
that
note
never
occurs
but
in
the
most
lovely
summer
weather
they
never
settle
on
the
ground
but
through
accident
and
when
down
can
hardly
rise
on
account
of
the
shortness
of
their
legs
and
the
length
of
their
wings
neither
can
they
walk
but
only
crawl
but
they
have
a
strong
grasp
with
their
feet
by
which
they
cling
to
walls
their
bodies
being
flat
they
can
enter
a
very
narrow
crevice
and
where
they
can
not
pass
on
their
bellies
they
will
turn
up
edgewise
the
particular
formation
of
the
foot
discriminates
the
swift
from
all
british
hirundines
and
indeed
from
all
other
known
birds
the
hirundo
melba

disposed

a
construction
most
rare
and
peculiar
but
nicely
adapted
to
the
purposes
in
which
their
feet
are
employed
this
and
some
peculiarities
attending
the
nostrils
and
under

have
induced
a

to

that

june
dear
sir
on
september
the
being
then
on
a
visit
and
intent
on
i
rose
before
daybreak
when
i
came
into
the
enclosures
i
found
the
stubbles
and
matted
all
over
with
a
thick
coat
of
cobweb
in
the
meshes
of
which
a
copious
and
heavy
dew
hung
so
plentifully
that
the
whole
face
of
the
country
seemed
as
it
were
covered
with
two
or
three
drawn
one
over
another
when
the
dogs
attempted
to
hunt
their
eyes
were
so
blinded
and
hoodwinked
that
they
could
not
proceed
but
were
obliged
to
lie
down
and
scrape
the
incumbrances
from
their
faces
with
their
so
that
finding
my
sport
interrupted
i
returned
home
musing
in
my
mind
on
the
oddness
of
the
occurrence
as
the
morning
advanced
the
sun
became
bright
and
warm
and
the
day
turned
out
one
of
those
most
lovely
ones
which
no
season
but
the
autumn
produces
cloudless
calm
serene
and
worthy
of
the
south
of
france
itself
about
nine
an
appearance
very
unusual
began
to
demand
our
attention
a
shower
of
cobwebs
falling
from
very
elevated
regions
and
continuing
without
any
interruption
till
the
close
of
the
day
these
webs
were
not
single
filmy
threads
floating
in
the
air
in
all
directions
but
perfect
flakes
or
rags
some
near
an
inch
broad
and
five
or
six
long
which
fell
with
a
degree
of
velocity
which
showed
they
were
considerably
heavier
than
the
atmosphere
on
every
side
as
the
observer
turned
his
eyes
might
he
behold
a
continual
succession
of
fresh
flakes
falling
into
his
sight
and
twinkling
like
stars
as
they
turned
their
sides
towards
the
sun
how
far
this
wonderful
shower
extended
would
be
difficult
to
say
but
we
know
that
it
reached
bradley
selborne
and
alresford
three
places
which
lie
in
a
sort
of
a
triangle
the
shortest
of
whose
sides
is
about
eight
miles
in
extent
at
the
second
of
those
places
there
was
a
gentleman
for
whose
veracity
and
intelligent
turn
we
have
the
greatest
veneration
who
observed
it
the
moment
he
got
abroad
but
concluded
that
as
soon
as
he
came
upon
the
hill
above
his
house
where
he
took
his
morning
rides
he
should
be
higher
than
this
meteor
which
he
imagined
might
have
been
blown
like
from
the
common
above
but
to
his
great
astonishment
when
he
rode
to
the
most
elevated
part
of
the
down
feet
above
his
fields
he
found
the
webs
in
appearance
still
as
much
above
him
as
before
still
descending
into
sight
in
a
constant
succession
and
twinkling
in
the
sun
so
as
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
most
incurious
neither
before
nor
after
was
any
such
fall
observed
but
on
this
day
the
flakes
hung
in
the
trees
and
hedges
so
thick
that
a
diligent
person
sent
out
might
have
gathered
baskets
full
the
remark
that
i
shall
make
on
these
appearances
called
gossamer
is
that
strange
and
superstitious
as
the
notions
about
them
were
formerly
nobody
in
these
days
doubts
but
that
they
are
the
real
production
of
small
spiders
which
swarm
in
the
fields
in
fine
weather
in
autumn
and
have
a
power
of
shooting
out
webs
from
their
tails
so
as
to
render
themselves
buoyant
and
lighter
than
air
but
why
these
rapturous
insects
should
that
day
take
such
a
wonderful
aerial
excursion
and
why
their
webs
should
at
once
become
so
gross
and
material
as
to
be
considerably
more
weighty
than
air
and
to
descend
with
precipitation
is
a
matter
beyond
my
skill
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
hazard
a
supposition
i
should
imagine
that
those
filmy
threads
when
first
shot
might
be
entangled
in
the
rising
dew
and
so
drawn
up
spiders
and
all
by
a
brisk
evaporation
into
the
region
where
clouds
are
formed
and
if
the
spiders
have
a
power
of
coiling
and
thickening
their
webs
in
the
air
as
lister
says
they
have
see
his
letters
to
ray
then
when
they
were
become
heavier
than
the
air
they
must
fall
every
day
in
fine
weather
in
autumn
chiefly
do
i
see
those
spiders
shooting
out
their
webs
and
mounting
aloft
they
will
go
off
from
your
finger

you
will
take
them
into

book
as
i
was
reading
in
the
parlour
and
running
to
the
top
of
the
page
and
shooting
out
a
web
took
its
departure
from
thence
but
what
i
most
wondered
at
was
that
it
went
off
with
considerable
velocity
in
a
place
where
no
air
was
stirring
and
i
am
sure
that
i
did
not
assist
it
with
my
breath
so
that
these
little
crawlers
seem
to
have

mounting
some
power
without

wings

dear
sir
there
is
a
wonderful
spirit
of
sociality
in
the
brute
creation
independent
of
sexual
attachment
the
congregating
of
gregarious
birds
in
the
winter
is
a
remarkable
instance
many
horses
though
quiet
with
company
will
not
stay
one
minute
in
a
field
by
themselves
the
strongest
fences
can
not
restrain
them
my
neighbour
horse
will
not
only
not
stay
by
himself
abroad
but
he
will
not
bear
to
be
left
alone
in
a
strange
stable
without
discovering
the
utmost
impatience
and
endeavouring
to
break
the
rack
and
manger
with
his
fore
feet
he
has
been
known
to
leap
out
at
a
through
which
dung
was
thrown
after
company
and
yet
in
other
respects
is
remarkably
quiet
oxen
and
cows
will
not
fatten
by
themselves
but
will
neglect
the
finest
pasture
that
is
not
recommended
by
society
it
would
be
needless
to
instance
in
sheep
which
constantly
flock
together
but
this
propensity
seems
not
to
be
confined
to
animals
of
the
same
species
for
we
know
a
doe
still
alive
that
was
brought
up
from
a
little
fawn
with
a
dairy
of
cows
with
them
it
goes
afield
and
with
them
it
returns
to
the
yard
the
dogs
of
the
house
take
no
notice
of
this
deer
being
used
to
her
but
if
strange
dogs
come
by
a
chase
ensues
while
the
master
smiles
to
see
his
favourite
securely
leading
her
pursuers
over
hedge
or
gate
or
stile
till
she
returns
to
the
cows
who
with
fierce
longings
and
menacing
horns
drive
the
assailants
quite
out
of
the
pasture
even
great
disparity
of
kind
and
size
does
not
always
prevent
social
advances
and
mutual
fellowship
for
a
very
intelligent
and
observant
person
has
assured
me
that
in
the
former
part
of
his
life
keeping
but
one
horse
he
happened
also
on
a
time
to
have
but
one
solitary
hen
these
two
incongruous
animals
spent
much
of
their
time
together
in
a
lonely
orchard
where
they
saw
no
creature
but
each
other
by
degrees
an
apparent
regard
began
to
take
place
between
these
two
sequestered
individuals
the
fowl
would
approach
the
quadruped
with
notes
of
complacency
rubbing
herself
gently
against
his
legs
while
the
horse
would
look
down
with
satisfaction
and
move
with
the
greatest
caution
and
circumspection
lest
he
should
trample
on
his
diminutive
companion
thus
by
mutual
good
offices
each
seemed
to
console
the
vacant
hours
of
the
other

that
milton
when
he
puts

sentiment
in

letter
xxv
to
the

barrington
selborne
dear
sir
we
have
two
gangs
or
hordes
of
gypsies
which
infest
the
south
and
west
of
england
and
come
round
in
their
circuit
two
or
three
times
in
the
year
one
of
these
tribes
calls
itself
by
the
noble
name
of
stanley
of
which
i
have
nothing
particular
to
say
but
the
other
is
distinguished
by
an
appellative
somewhat
remarkable
as
far
as
their
harsh
gibberish
can
be
understood
they
seem
to
say
that
the
name
of
their
clan
is
curleople
now
the
termination
of
this
word
is
apparently
grecian
and
as
mezeray
and
the
gravest
historians
all
agree
that
these
vagrants
did
certainly
migrate
from
egypt
and
the
east
two
or
three
centuries
ago
and
so
spread
by
degrees
over
europe
may
not
this
name
a
little
corrupted
be
the
very
name
they
brought
with
them
from
the
levant
it
would
be
matter
of
some
curiosity
could
one
meet
with
an
intelligent
person
among
them
to
inquire
whether
in
their
jargon
they
still
retain
any
greek
words
the
greek
radicals

appear

it
is

that

many
mutilated
remains
of

might
still
be
discovered
with
regard
to
those
peculiar
people
the
gypsies
one
thing
is
very
remarkable
and
especially
as
they
came
from
warmer
climates
and
that
is
that
while
other
beggars
lodge
in
barns
stables
and
these
sturdy
savages
seem
to
pride
themselves

the

i
shall
make
no
apology
for
troubling
you
with
the
detail
of
a
very
simple
piece
of
domestic
economy
being
satisfied
that
you
think
nothing
beneath
your
attention
that
tends
to
utility
the
matter
alluded
to
is
the
use
of
rushes
instead
of
candles
which
i
am
well
aware
prevails
in
many
districts
besides
this
but
as
i
know
there
are
countries
also
where
it
does
not
obtain
and
as
i
have
considered
the
subject
with
some
degree
of
exactness
i
shall
proceed
in
my
humble
story
and
leave
you
to
judge
of
the
expediency
the
proper
species
of
rush
for
this
purpose
seems
to
be
the
juncus
effusus
or
common
soft
rush
which
is
to
be
found
in
most
moist
pastures
by
the
sides
of
streams
and
under
hedges
these
rushes
are
in
best
condition
in
the
height
of
summer
but
may
be
gathered
so
as
to
serve
the
purpose
well
quite
on
to
autumn
it
would
be
needless
to
add
that
the
largest
and
longest
are
best
decayed
labourers
women
and
children
make
it
their
business
to
procure
and
prepare
them
as
soon
as
they
are
cut
they
must
be
flung
into
water
and
kept
there
for
otherwise
they
will
dry
and
shrink
and
the
peel
will
not
run
at
first
a
person
would
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
divest
a
rush
of
its
peel
or
rind
so
as
to
leave
one
regular
narrow
even
rib
from
top
to
bottom
that
may
support
the
pith
but
this
like
other
feats
soon
becomes
familiar
even
to
children
and
we
have
seen
an
old
woman
performing
this
business
with
great
dispatch
and
seldom
failing
to
strip
them
with
the
nicest
regularity
when
these
junci
are
thus
far
prepared
they
must
lie
out
on
the
grass
to
be
bleached
and
take
the
dew
for
some
nights
and
afterwards
be
dried
in
the
sun
some
address
is
required
in
dipping
these
rushes
in
the
scalding
fat
or
grease
but
this
knack
also
is
to
be
attained
by
practice
the
careful
wife
of
an
industrious
hampshire
labourer
obtains
all
her
fat
for
nothing
for
she
saves
the
scumrnings
of
her
for
this
use
and
if
the
grease
abounds
with
salt
she
causes
the
salt
to
precipitate
to
the
bottom
by
setting
the
scummings
in
a
warm
oven
where
hogs
are
not
much
in
use
and
especially
by
the
side
the
coarser
animal
oils
will
come
very
cheap
a
pound
of
common
grease
may
be
procured
for
four
pence
and
about
six
pounds
of
grease
will
dip
a
pound
of
rushes
and
one
pound
of
rushes
may
be
bought
for
one
shilling
so
that
a
pound
of
rushes
medicated
and
ready
for
use
will
cost
three
shillings
if
men
that
keep
bees
will
mix
a
little
wax
with
the
grease
it
will
give
it
a
consistency
and
render
it
more
cleanly
and
make
the
rushes
burn
longer
would
have
the
same
effect
a
good
rush
which
measured
in
length
two
feet
four
inches
and
an
half
being
minuted
burnt
only
three
minutes
short
of
an
hour
and
a
rush
still
of
greater
length
has
been
known
to
burn
one
hour
and
a
quarter
these
rushes
give
a
good
clear
light
coated
with
tallow
it
is
true
shed
a
dismal
one
visible
but
then
the
wicks
of
those
have
two
ribs
of
the
rind
or
peel
to
support
the
pith
while
the
wick
of
the
dipped
rush
has
but
one
the
two
ribs
are
intended
to
impede
the
progress
of
the
flame
and
make
the
candle
last
in
a
pound
of
dry
rushes
avoirdupois
which
i
caused
to
be
weighed
and
numbered
we
found
upwards
of
one
thousand
six
hundred
individuals
now
suppose
each
of
these
burns
one
with
another
only
half
an
hour
then
a
poor
man
will
purchase
eight
hundred
hours
of
light
a
time
exceeding
entire
days
for
three
shillings
according
to
this
account
each
rush
before
dipping
costs
of
a
farthing
and
afterwards
thus
a
poor
family
will
enjoy
hours
of
comfortable
light
for
a
farthing
an
experienced
old
housekeeper
assures
me
that
one

and
a
half
of
rushes
completely
supplies
his

dear
sir
we
had
in
this
village
more
than
twenty
years
ago
an
whom
i
well
remember
who
from
a
child
showed
a
strong
propensity
to
bees
they
were
his
food
his
amusement
his
sole
object
and
as
people
of
this
cast
have
seldom
more
than
one
point
in
view
so
this
lad
exerted
all
his
few
faculties
on
this
one
pursuit
in
the
winter
he
dosed
away
his
time
within
his
father
house
by
the
fireside
in
a
kind
of
torpid
state
seldom
departing
from
the
but
in
the
summer
he
was
all
alert
and
in
quest
of
his
game
in
the
fields
and
on
sunny
banks
honeybees
bees
and
wasps
were
his
prey
wherever
he
found
them
he
had
no
apprehensions
from
their
stings
but
would
seize
them
nudis
manibus
and
at
once
disarm
them
of
their
weapons
and
suck
their
bodies
for
the
sake
of
their
sometimes
he
would
fill
his
bosom
between
his
shirt
and
his
skin
with
a
number
of
these
captives
and
sometimes
would
confine
them
in
bottles
he
was
a
very
merops
apiaster
or
and
very
injurious
to
men
that
kept
bees
for
he
would
slide
into
their
and
sitting
down
before
the
stools
would
rap
with
his
finger
on
the
hives
and
so
take
the
bees
as
they
came
out
he
has
been
known
to
overturn
hives
for
the
sake
of
honey
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
where
metheglin
was
making
he
would
linger
round
the
tubs
and
vessels
begging
a
draught
of
what
he
called
as
he
ran
about
he
used
to
make
a
humming
noise
with
his
lips
resembling
the
buzzing
of
bees
this
lad
was
lean
and
sallow
and
of
a
cadaverous
complexion
and
except
in
his
favourite
pursuit
in
which
he
was
wonderfully
adroit
discovered
no
manner
of
understanding
had
his
capacity
been
better
and
directed
to
the
same
object
he
had
perhaps
abated
much
of
our
wonder
at
the
feats
of
a
more
modern
exhibitor
of
bees
and
we
may
justly
say
of
him
now
thou
had

off

at
a
time
when
they
take

so
interwoven
into
our
very
constitutions
that
the
strongest
good
sense
is
required
to
disengage
ourselves
from
them
no
wonder
therefore
that
the
lower
people
retain
them
their
whole
lives
through
since
their
minds
are
not
invigorated
by
a
liberal
education
and
therefore
not
enabled
to
make
any
efforts
adequate
to
the
occasion
such
a
preamble
seems
to
be
necessary
before
we
enter
on
the
superstitions
of
this
district
lest
we
should
be
suspected
of
exaggeration
in
a
recital
of
practices
too
gross
for
this
enlightened
age

the
people
of
tring
in
hertfordshire
would
do
well
to
remember
that
no
longer
ago
than
the
year
and
within
twenty
miles
of
the
capital
they
seized
on
two
superannuated
wretches
crazed
with
age
and
overwhelmed
with
infirmities
on
a
suspicion
of
witchcraft
and
by
trying
experiments
drowned
them
in

the

at

row

by
the

long
cicatrices
down
their
sides
manifestly
show
that
in

times
they
have
been
cleft
asunder

trees
when
young
and
flexible
were
severed
and
held
open
by
wedges
while
ruptured
children
stripped
naked
were
pushed
through
the
apertures
under
a
persuasion
that
by
such
a
process
the
poor
babes
would
be
cured
of
their
infirmity
as
soon
as
the
operation
was
over

with

in

derived
down
perhaps
from

practiced
it
before
their

stood
about

perfect

no

that
has
not

can
imagine
how
much
water
one
tree
will
distil
in

condensing

down

so
as
to
make
the

in

dropped
so
fast
that

not
there
are
no

the
people
are
supplied
with
that
necessary
element
water
merely
by
the
dripping
of
some
large
tall
trees
which
standing
in
the
bosom
of
a
mountain
keep
their
heads
constantly
enveloped
with
fogs
and
clouds
from
which
they
dispense
their
kindly
moisture
and
so
render
those
districts
habitable
by

alone
trees
in

have
such
a
vast
proportion
more
of
surface
than
those
that
are
naked
that
in
theory
their
condensations
should
greatly
exceed
those
that
are
stripped
of
their

but
as
the
former
imbibe
also
a
great
quantity

it
is
difficult

deciduous

to

therefore
that
they
contribute

and

that

are
great
promoters
of
lakes
and

appears
from
a
fact
in

america
for
since
the

forests
have
been
grubbed
and
cleared
all
bodies
of
water
are
much
diminished

that
some

not
now
drive
a

few
phenomena
are

the

on
the
summits
of
many
of
which
are
never
dry
in
the
most
trying
droughts
of

i
say
because
in
many
rocky
and
gravelly
soils
springs
usually
break
out
pretty
high
on
the
sides
of
elevated
grounds
and
mountains
but
no
person
acquainted
with
chalky
districts
will
allow
that
they
ever
saw
springs
in
such
a
soil
but
in
valleys
and
bottoms
since
the
waters
of
so
pervious
a
stratum
as
chalk
all
lie
on
one
dead
level
as
have
assured
me
again
and
again
now
we
have
many
such
little
round
ponds
in
this
district
and
one
in
particular
on
our
three
hundred
feet
above
my
house
which
though
never
above
three
feet
deep
in
the
middle
and
not
more
than
thirty
feet
in
diameter
and
containing
perhaps
not
more
than
two
or
three
hundred
hogsheads
of
water
yet
never
is
known
to
fail
though
it
affords
drink
for
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
sheep
and
for
at
least
twenty
head
of
large
cattle
beside
this
pond
it
is
true

with
two
moderate
beeches
that
doubtless
at
times
afford
it
much
supply
but
then
we
have
others
as
small

without
the
aid
of
trees
and
in
spite
of
evaporation
from
sun
and
wind
and
perpetual
consumption
by
cattle
yet
constantly
maintain
a
moderate
share
of
water
without
overflowing
in
the
wettest
seasons
as
they
would
do
if
supplied
by
springs
by
my
journal
of
may
it
appears
that
small
and
even
considerable
ponds
in
the
vales
are
now
dried
up
while
the
small
ponds
on
the
very
tops
of
hills
are
but
little
affected
can
this
difference
be
accounted
for
from
evaporation
alone
which
certainly
is
more
prevalent
in
bottoms
or
rather
have
not
those
elevated
pools
some
unnoticed
recruits
which
in
the
night
time
counterbalance
the
waste
of
the
day
without
which
the
cattle
alone
must
soon
exhaust
them

here
it
will
be
necessary

enter
more
minutely

the
cause

from

that
moister
the

the

a
double
quantity
of
dew
falls
on

of

there
does
on
an
equal

we
see
that
water
by
its
coolness
is
enabled
to
assimilate
to
itself
a
large
quantity
of
moisture
nightly
by
condensation

a

seems
persuaded
that
he
has
discovered
the
reason
why
cuckoos
do
not
hatch
their
own
eggs
the
impediment
he
supposes
arises
from
the
internal
structure
of
their
parts
which
incapacitates
them
for
incubation
according
to
this
gentleman
the
crop
or
craw
of
a
cuckoo
does
not
lie
before
the
sternum
at
the
bottom
of
the
neck
as
in
the
gallinae

immediately
behind
it
on
and
over
the
bowels

as
to
make

histoire

induced
by
this
assertion
we
procured
a
cuckoo
and
cutting
open
the

exposing
the
intestines
to
sight
found
the
crop
lying
as
mentioned
above
this
stomach
was
large
and
round
and
stuffed
hard
like
a
with
food
which
upon
nice
examination
we
found
to
consist
of
various
insects
such
as
small
scarabs
spiders
and
the
last
of
which
we
have
seen
cuckoos
catching
on
the
wing
as
they
were
just
emerging
out
of
the
aurelia
state
among
this
farrago
also
were
to
be
seen
maggots
and
many
seeds
which
belonged
either
to
gooseberries
currants
cranberries
or
some
such
fruit
so
that
these
birds
apparently
subsist
on
insects
and
fruits
nor
was
there
the
least
appearance
of
bones
feathers
or
fur
to
support
the
idle
notion
of
their
being
birds
of
prey
the
sternum
in
this
bird
seemed
to
us
to
be
remarkably
short
between
which
and
the
anus
lay
the
crop
or
craw
and
immediately
behind
that
the
bowels
against
the
backbone
it
must
be
allowed
as
this
anatomist
observes
that
the
crop
placed
just
upon
the
bowels
must
especially
when
full
be
in
a
very
uneasy
situation
during
the
business
of
incubation
yet
the
test
will
be
to
examine
whether
birds
that
are
actually
known
to
sit
for
certain
are
not
formed
in
a
similar
manner
this
inquiry
i
proposed
to
myself
to
make
with
a
or
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
because
if
their
information
proves
the
same
the
reason
for
incapacity
in
the
cuckoo
will
be
allowed
to
have
been
taken
up
somewhat
hastily
not
long
after
a
was
procured
which
from
its
habit
and
shape
we
suspected
might
resemble
the
cuckoo
in
its
internal
construction
nor
were
our
suspicions
for
upon
the
dissection
the
crop
or
craw
also
lay
behind
the
sternum
immediately
on
the
viscera
between
them
and
the
skin
of
the
belly
it
was
bulky
and
stuffed
hard
with
large
phalaenae
moths
of
several
sorts
and
their
eggs
which
no
doubt
had
been
forced
out
of
those
insects
by
the
action
of
swallowing
now
as
it
appears
that
this
bird
which
is
so
well
known
to
practice
incubation
is
formed
in
a
similar
manner

cuckoos
monsieur

conjecture
that
cuckoos
are
incapable
of
incubation
from
the
disposition
of
their

seems
to
fall

very
heavy
and
bloated
as
it
lay
in
the

in
the

we
came
to
cut
it
up
we
found
that
the
abdomen
was
crowded
with
young
fifteen
in
number
the
shortest
of
which
measured
full
seven
inches
and
were
about
the
size
of
earthworms
this
little
fry
issued
into
the
world
with
the
true
spirit
about
them
showing
great
alertness
as
soon
as
disengaged
from
the
belly
of
the
dam
they
twisted
and
wriggled
about
and
set
themselves
up
and
gaped
very
wide
when
touched
with
a
stick
showing
manifest
tokens
of
menace
and
defiance
though
as
yet
they
had
no
manner
of
fangs

we
could
find
even
with
the
help
of
our
glasses
to
a
thinking
mind
nothing
is
more
wonderful
than
that
early
instinct
which
impresses
young
animals
with
the
notion
of
the
situation
of
their
natural
weapons
and
of
using
them
properly
in
their
own
defence
even
before
those
weapons
subsist
or
are
formed
thus
a
young
cock
will
spar
at
his
adversary
before
his
spurs
are
grown
and
a
calf
or
a
lamb
will
push
with
their
heads
before
their
horns
are
sprouted

the

manner
did
these
young
adders
attempt
to
bite
before
their
fangs

the
dam
however
was
furnished
with
very
formidable
ones
which
we
lifted
up
for
they
fold
down
when
not
used
and
cut
them
off
with
the
point
of
our
scissors
there
was
little
room
to
suppose
that
this
brood
had
ever
been
in
the
open
air
before
and
that
they
were
taken
in
for
refuge
at
the
mouth
of
the
dam
when
she
perceived
that
danger
was
approaching
because
then
probably
we
should
have
found
them
somewhere
in
the
neck
and
not
in
the
abdomen

a
strange
effect
it
emasculates
both
man
beast

brings
them
to
a

they

the

it

the
natural
term
of
an
hog
life
is
little
known
and
the
reason
is
plain
because
it
is
neither
profitable
nor
convenient
to
keep
that
turbulent
animal
to
the
full
extent
of
its
time
however
my
neighbour
a
man
of
substance
who
had
no
occasion
to
study
every
little
advantage
to
a
nicety
kept
an
bantam
sow
who
was
as
thick
as
she
was
long
and
whose
belly
swept
on
the
ground
till
she
was
advanced
to
her
seventeenth
year
at
which
period
she
showed
some
tokens
of
age
by
the
decay
of
her
teeth
and
the
decline
of
her
fertility
for
about
ten
years
this
prolific
mother
produced
two
litters
in
the
year
of
about
ten
at
a
time
and
once
above
twenty
at
a
litter

as
there

double

experience
in

this
female
was
grown
very
sagacious
and
artful
she
found
occasion
to
converse
with
a
boar
she
used
to
open
all
the
intervening
gates
and
march
by
herself
up
to
a
distant
farm
where
one
was
kept
and
when
her
purpose
was
served
would
return
by
the
same
means
at
the
age
of
about
fifteen
her
litters
began
to
be
reduced
to

we
have
remarked
in
a
former

how
much
incongruous
animals
in
a
lonely
state
may
be
attached
to
each
other
from
a
spirit
of
sociality
in
this
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
recount
a
different
motive
which
has
been
known
to
create
as
strange
a
fondness
my
friend
had
a
little
helpless
leveret
brought
to
him
which
the
servants
fed
with
milk
in
a
spoon
and
about
the
same
time
his
cat
kittened
and
the
young
were
dispatched
and
buried
the
hare
was
soon
lost
and
supposed
to
be
gone
the
way
of
most
foundlings
to
be
killed
by
some
dog
or
cat
however
in
about
a
fortnight
as
the
master
was
sitting
in
his
garden
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
he
observed
his
cat
with
tail
erect
trotting
towards
him
and
calling
with
little
short
inward
notes
of
complacency
such
as
they
use
towards
their
kittens
and
something
gamboling
after
which
proved
to
be
the
leveret
that
the
cat
had
supported
with
her
milk
and
continued
to
support
with
great
affection
thus
was
a
graminivorous
animal
nurtured
by
a
carnivorous
and
predaceous
one
why
so
cruel
and
sanguinary
a
beast
as
a
cat
of
the
ferocious
genus
of
feles
the
murium
leo
as
linnaeus
calls
it
should
be
affected
with
any
tenderness
towards
an
animal
which
is
its
natural
prey
is
not
so
easy
to
determine
this
strange
affection
probably
was
occasioned
by
that
desiderium
those
tender
maternal
feelings
which
the
loss
of
her
kittens
had
awakened
in
her
breast
and
by
the
complacency
and
ease
she
derived
to
herself
from
the
procuring
her
teats
to
be
drawn
which
were
too
much
distended
with
milk
till
from
habit
she
became
as
much
delighted
with
this
foundling
as
if
it
had
been
her
real
offspring
this
incident
is
no
bad
solution
of
that
strange
circumstance
which
grave
historians
as
well
as
the
poets
assert
of
exposed
children
being
sometimes
nurtured
by
female
wild
beasts
that
probably
had
lost
their

it
is
not
one
whit
more
marvellous
that
romulus

should
be
nursed

that

always
poor
and
probably
the
reason
may
be
because
the
worms
are
drowned

most
insignificant

are
of
much
more
consequence

much
more
influence
in

than
the
incurious

mighty
in

from
their
minuteness
which
renders
them
less
an
object
of
attention

from
their

fecundity
though
in
appearance
a
small

despicable

chasm
for

the

seem
to
be
the
great
promoters
of
vegetation
which
would
proceed

lamely
without
them
by
boring
perforating

loosening
the
soil

rendering
it
pervious
to
rains
and
the

by
drawing
straws

most
of
all
by
throwing
up
such
infinite
numbers
of

being
their
excrement
is
a
fine
manure

probably
provide
new

for

slopes
where
the

washes
the

away
and
they
affect

to
avoid

express
their
detestation
of

the
former
because
they
render
their

unsightly

make
them

the
latter
because
as
they
think
worms
eat
their
green
corn

these
men
would
find
that
the
earth
without
worms
would
soon
become
cold
and
void
of
fermentation

consequently
sterile
and
besides
in
favour
of
worms
it
should
be
hinted
that

are
not

much
injured

dear

you
can
not
but
remember
that
the
and
of
last
march
were
very
hot
days
so
sultry
that
everybody
complained
and
were
restless
under
those
sensations
to
which
they
had
not
been
reconciled
by
gradual
approaches
this
sudden
heat
was
attended
by
many
summer
coincidences
for
on
those
two
days
the
thermometer
rose
to
six
in
the
shade
many
species
of
insects
revived
and
came
forth
some
bees
swarmed
in
this
neighbourhood
the
old
tortoise
near
lewes
in
sussex
awakened
and
came
forth
out
of
its
dormitory
and
what
is
most
to
my
present
purpose
many
appeared
and
were
very
alert
in
many
places
and
particularly
at
cobham
in
surrey
but
as
that
short
warm
period
was
succeeded
as
well
as
preceded
by
harsh
severe
weather
with
frequent
frosts
and
ice
and
cutting
winds
the
insects
withdrew
the
tortoise
retired
again
into
the
ground
and
the
swallows
were
seen
no
more
until
the
tenth
of
april
when
the
rigour
of
the
spring
abating
a
softer
season
began
to
prevail
again
it
appears
by
my
journals
for
many
years
past
that
martins
retire
to
a
bird
about
the
beginning
of
october
so
that
a
person
not
very
observant
of
such
matters
would
conclude
that
they
had
taken
their
last
farewell
but
then
it
may
be
seen
in
my
diaries
also
that
considerable
flocks
have
discovered
themselves
again
in
the
first
week
of
november
and
often
on
the
fourth
day
of
that
month
only
for
one
day
and
that
not
as
if
they
were
in
actual
migration
but
playing
about
at
their
leisure
and
feeding
calmly
as
if
no
enterprise
of
moment
at
all
agitated
their
spirits
and
this
was
the
case
in
the
beginning
of
this
very
month
for
on
the
fourth
of
november
more
than
twenty
which
in
appearance
had
all
departed
about
the
seventh
of
october
were
seen
again
for
that
one
morning
only
sporting
between
my
fields
and
the
hanger
and
feasting
on
insects
which
swarmed
in
that
sheltered
district
the
preceding
day
was
wet
and
blustering
but
the
fourth
was
dark
and
mild
and
soft
the
wind
at
and
the
thermometer
at
a
pitch
not
common
at
that
season
of
the
year
moreover
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
add
in
this
place
that
whenever
the
thermometer
is
above
the
bat
comes
flitting
out
in
every
autumnal
and
winter
month
from
all
these
circumstances
laid
together
it
is
obvious
that
torpid
insects
reptiles
and
quadrupeds
are
awakened
from
their
profoundest
slumbers
by
a
little
untimely
warmth
and
therefore
that
nothing
so
much
promotes
this
stupor
as
a
defect
of
heat
and
farther
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
two
whole
species
or
at

many
individuals
of
those
two
species
of
british
hirundines
do
never
leave
this
island
at
all

partake
of
the

benumbed

we
can
not
suppose
that
after
a
absence
can
return
from

in

there
was
in
this
village
several
years
ago
a
miserable
pauper
who
from
his
birth
was
addicted
with
a
leprosy
as
far
as
we
are
aware
of
a
singular
kind
since
it
affected
only
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
the
soles
of
his
feet
this
scaly
eruption
usually
broke
out
twice
in
the
year
at
the
spring
and
fall
and
by
peeling
away
left
the
skin
so
thin
and
tender
that
neither
his
hands
or
feet
were
able
to
perform
their
functions
so
that
the
poor
object
was
half
his
time
on
crutches
incapable
of
employ
and
languishing
in
a
tiresome
state
of
indolence
and
inactivity
his
habit
was
lean
lank
and
cadaverous
in
this
sad
plight
he
dragged
on
a
miserable
existence
a
burden
to
himself
and
his
parish
which
was
obliged
to
support
him
till
he
was
relieved
by
death
at
more
than
thirty
years
of
age
the
good
women
who
love
to
account
for
every
defect
in
children
by
the
doctrine
of
longing
said
that
his
mother
felt
a
violent
propensity
for
oysters
which
she
was
unable
to
gratify
and
that
the
black
rough
scurf
on
his
hands
and
feet
were
the
shells
of
that
fish
we
knew
his
parents
neither
of
which
were
lepers

father
in
particular
lived
to
be
far
advanced
in
years

all
ages
the
leprosy
has
made
dreadful
havoc
among
mankind
the
israelites
seem
to
have
been
greatly
afflicted
with
it
from
the
most
remote
times
as
appears
from
the
peculiar
and
repeated
injunctions
given
them
in
the
levitical
law

was
the
rancour
of
this
foul
disorder
much
abated

period
of

commonwealth

may
be
seen
in
many
passages
of
the
new
testament
see
leviticus
chap
xiii
and
xiv
some
centuries
ago
this
horrible
distemper
prevailed
all
europe
over
and
our
forefathers
were
by
no
means
exempt
as
appears
by
the
large
provision
made
for
objects
labouring
under
this
calamity
there
was
an
hospital
for
female
lepers
in
the
diocese
of
lincoln
a
noble
one
near
durham
three
in
london
and
southwark
and
perhaps
many
more
in
or
near
our
great
towns
and
cities
moreover
some
crowned
heads
and
other
wealthy
and
charitable
personages
bequeathed
large
legacies
to
such
poor
people
as
languished
under
this
hopeless
infirmity
it
must
therefore
in
these
days
be
to
an
humane
and
thinking
person
a
matter
of
equal
wonder
and
satisfaction
when
he
contemplates
how
nearly
this
pest
is
eradicated
and
observes
that
a
leper
now
is
a
rare
sight
he
will
moreover
when
engaged
in
such
a
train
of
thought
naturally
inquire
for
the
reason
this
happy
change
perhaps
may
have
originated
and
been
continued
from
the
much
smaller
quantity
of
salted
meat
and
fish
now
eaten
in
these
kingdoms
from
the
use
of
linen
next
the
skin
from
the
plenty
of
better
bread
and
from
the
profusion
of
fruits
roots
legumes
and
greens
so
common
in
every
family
three
or
four
centuries
ago
before
there
were
any
enclosures
or
or
hay
all
the
cattle
which
had
grown
fat
in
summer
and
were
not
killed
for
were
turned
out
soon
after
michaelmas
to
shift
as
they
could
through
the
dead
months
so
that
no
fresh
meat
could
be
had
in
winter
or
spring
hence
the
marvellous
account
of
the
vast
stores
of
salted
flesh
found
in
the
larder
of
the
eldest
t
in
the
days
of
edward
the
second
even
so
late
in
the
spring
as
the
third
of
may
it
was
from
magazines
like
these
that
the
turbulent
barons
supported
in
idleness
their
riotous
swarms
of
retainers
ready
for
any
disorder
or
mischief
but
agriculture
is
now
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
perfection
that
our
best
and
fattest
meats
are
killed
in
the
winter
and
no
man
need
eat
salted
flesh
unless
he
prefers
it
that
has
money
to
buy
fresh
viz
six
hundred
bacons
eighty
carcasses
of
beef
and
six
hundred
muttons
one
cause
of
this
distemper
might
be
no
doubt
the
quantity
of
wretched
fresh
and
salt
fish
consumed
by
the
commonalty
at
all
seasons
as
well
as
in
lent
which
our
poor
now
would
hardly
be
persuaded
to
touch
the
use
of
linen
changes
shirts
or
shifts
in
the
room
of
sordid
and
filthy
woollen
long
worn
next
the
skin
is
a
matter
of
neatness
comparatively
modern
but
must
prove
a
great
means
of
preventing
cutaneous
ails
at
this
very
time
woollen
instead
of
linen
prevails
among
the
poorer
welch
who
are
subject
to
foul
eruptions
the
plenty
of
good
wheaten
bread
that
now
is
found
among
all
ranks
of
people
in
the
south
instead
of
that
miserable
sort
which
used
in
old
days
to
be
made
of
barley
or
beans
may
contribute
not
a
little
to
the
sweetening
their
blood
and
correcting
their
juices
for
the
inhabitants
of
mountainous
districts
to
this
day
are
still
liable
to
the
itch
and
other
cutaneous
disorders
from
a
wretchedness
and
poverty
of
diet
as
to
the
produce
of
a
garden
every
person
of
observation
may
perceive
within
his
own
memory
both
in
town
and
country
how
vastly
the
consumption
of
vegetables
is
increased
in
cities
now
support
multitudes
in
a
comfortable
state
while
gardeners
get
fortunes
every
decent
labourer
also
has
his
garden
which
is
half
his
support
as
well
as
his
delight
and
common
farmers
provide
plenty
of
beans
peas
and
greens
for
their
hinds
to
eat
with
their
bacon
and
those
few
that
do
not
are
despised
for
their
sordid
parsimony
and
looked
upon
as
regardless
of
the
welfare
of
their
dependents
potatoes
have
prevailed
in
this
little
district
by

of

within
these
twenty
years

and
are
much
esteemed
here
now
by
the
poor
who
would
scarce
have
ventured
to
taste
them
in
the
last

our
saxon
ancestors
certainly
had
some
sort
of
cabbage

they
call

but
long
after
their
days
the
cultivation
of
gardens
was
little
attended

the
religious

men
of
leisure
and
keeping
up
a
constant

were
the
first
people
among
us
that
had
gardens
and
in
any
perfection
within
the
walls
of
their
and

the
barons
neglected
every
pursuit

did
not

were

it
was
not
till
gentlemen
took
up

made

hasty
advances

us

corroborates
what
has

we
find

observing

dear
sir
in
a
district
so
diversified
as
this
so
full
of
hollow
vales
and
hanging
woods
it
is
no
wonder
that
echoes
should
abound
many
we
have
discovered
that
return
the
cry
of
a
pack
of
dogs
the
notes
of
a
a
tunable
ring
of
bells
or
the
melody
of
birds
very
agreeably
but
we
were
still
at
a
loss
for
a
polysyllabical
articulate
echo
till
a
young
gentleman
who
had
parted
from
his
company
in
a
summer
evening
walk
and
was
calling
after
them
stumbled
upon
a
very
curious
one
in
a
spot
where
it
might
least
be
expected
at
first
he
was
much
surprised
and
could
not
be
persuaded
but
that
he
was
mocked
by
some
boy
but
repeating
his
trials
in
several
languages
and
finding
his
respondent
to
be
a
very
adroit
polyglot
he
then
discerned
the
deception
this
echo
in
an
evening
before
rural
noises
cease
would
repeat
ten
syllables
most
articulately
and
distinctly
especially
if
quick
dactyls
were
chosen
the
last
syllables
of
tityre
tu
patulae
recubans
were
as
audibly
and
intelligibly
returned
as
the
first
and
there
is
no
doubt
could
trial
have
been
made
but
that
at
midnight
when
the
air
is
very
elastic
and
a
dead
stillness
prevails
one
or
two
syllables
more
might
have
been
obtained
but
the
distance
rendered
so
late
an
experiment
very
inconvenient
quick
dactyls
we
observed
succeeded
best
for
when
we
came
to
try
its
powers
in
slow
heavy
embarrassed
spondees
of
the
same
number
of
syllables
monstrum
horrendum
informe
ingens
we
could
perceive
a
return
but
of
four
or
five
all
echoes
have
some
one
place
to
which
they
are
returned
stronger
and
more
distinct
than
to
any
other
and
that
is
always
the
place
that
lies
at
right
angles
with
the
object
of
repercussion
and
is
not
too
near
nor
too
far
off
buildings
or
naked
rocks
much
more
articulately
than
hanging
wood
or
vales
because
in
the
latter
the
voice
is
as
it
were
entangled
and
embarrassed
in
the
covert
and
weakened
in
the
rebound
the
true
object
of
this
echo
as
we
found
by
various
experiments
is
the
tiled
in
galleylane
which
measures
in
front
feet
and
from
the
ground
to
the
eaves
feet
the
true
centrum
phonicum
or
just
distance
is
one
particular
spot
in
the
in
the
path
to
on
the
very
brink
of
the
steep
balk
above
the
hollow
cart
way
in
this
case
there
is
no
choice
of
distance
but
the
path
by
mere
contingency
happens
to
be
the
lucky
the
identical
spot
because
the
ground
rises
or
falls
so
immediately
if
the
speaker
either
retires
or
advances
that
his
mouth
would
at
once
be
above
or
below
the
object
we
measured
this
polysyllabical
echo
with
great
exactness
and
found
the
distance
to
fall
very
short
of
dr
plot
rule
for
distinct
articulation
for
the
doctor
in
his
history
of
oxfordshire
allows
feet
for
the
return
of
each
syllable
distinctly
hence
this
echo
which
gives
ten
distinct
syllables
ought
to
measure
yards
or
feet
to
each
syllable
whereas
our
distance
is
only
yards
or
near
feet
to
each
syllable
thus
our
measure
falls
short
of
the
doctor
as
five
to
eight
but
then
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
this
candid
philosopher
was
convinced
afterwards
that
some
latitude
must
be
admitted
of
in
the
distance
of
echoes
according
to
time
and
place
when
experiments
of
this
sort
are
making
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
weather
and
the
time
of
day
have
a
vast
influence
on
an
echo
for
a
dull
heavy
moist
air
deadens
and
clogs
the
sound
and
hot
sunshine
renders
the
air
thin
and
weak
and
deprives
it
of
all
its
springiness
and
a
ruffling
wind
quite
defeats
the
whole
in
a
still
clear
dewy
evening
the
air
is
most
elastic
and
perhaps
the
later
the
hour
the
more
so
echo
has
always
been
so
amusing
to
the
imagination
that
the
poets
have
personified
her
and
in
their
hands
she
has
been
the
occasion
of
many
a
beautiful
fiction
nor
need
the
gravest
man
be
ashamed
to
appear
taken
with
such
a
phenomenon
since
it
may
become
the
subject
of
philosophical
or
mathematical
inquiries
one
should
have
imagined
that
echoes
if
not
entertaining
must
at
least
have
been
harmless
and
inoffensive
yet
virgil
advances
a
strange
notion
that
they
are
injurious
to
bees
after
enumerating
some
probable
and
reasonable
annoyances
such
as
prudent
owners
would
wish
far
removed
from
their

image
this
wild
and
fanciful
assertion
will
hardly
be
admitted
by
the
philosophers
of
these
days
especially
as
they
all
now
seem
agreed
that
insects
are
not
furnished
with
any
organs
of
hearing
at
all
but
if
it
should
be
urged
that
though
they
can
not
hear
yet
perhaps
they
may
feel
the
repercussion
of
sounds
i
grant
it
is
possible
they
may
yet
that
these
impressions
are
distasteful
or
hurtful
i
deny
because
bees
in
good
summers
thrive
well
in
my
outlet
where
the
echoes
are
very
strong
for
this
village

another
anathoth
a
place
of
responses
or
echoes
besides
it
does
not
appear
from
experiment
that
bees
are
in
any
way
capable
of
being
affected
by
sounds
for
i
have
often
tried
my
own
with
a
large
trumpet
held
close
to
their
hives
and
with
such
an
exertion
of
voice
as
would
have
hailed
a
ship
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
still
these
insects
pursued
their
various
employments
undisturbed
and
without
showing
the
least
sensibility
or
resentment
some
time
since
its
discovery
this
echo
is
become
totally
silent
though
the
object
or
remains
nor
is
there
any
mystery
in
this
defect
for
the
field
between

planted
as
an
and
the
voice
of
the
speaker
is
totally
absorbed
and
lost
among
the
poles
and
entangled
foliage
of
the
hops
and
when
the
poles
are
removed
in
autumn
the
disappointment
is
the
same
because
a
tall
hedge
nurtured
up
for
the
purpose
of
shelter
to
the
hop
ground
entirely
interrupts
the
impulse
and
repercussion
of
the
voice
so
that
till
those
obstructions
are
removed
no
more
of
its
garrulity
can
be
expected
should
any
gentleman
of
fortune
think
an
echo
in
his
park
or
outlet
a
pleasing
incident
he
might
build
one
at
little
or
no
expense
for
whenever
he
had
occasion
for
a
new
barn
stable
or
the
like
structure
it
would
be
only
needful
to
erect
this
building
on
the
gentle
declivity
of
an
hill
with
a
like
rising
opposite
to
it
at
a
few
hundred
yards
distance

perhaps
success
might
be
the
easier
ensured
could
some
canal

stream
intervene

in
the

every

the
result
of
my

been
exactly
the

for

long
time
past
the
swallows
and

are
so
numerous
and
so
widely
distributed
over
the

that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
recount
them
while
the

though
they
do
not
all
build
in

yet
so
frequently
haunt
it
and
play
and
rendezvous
round
it
that
they
are
easily
enumerated
the
number
that
i
constantly
find
are
eight

about
half
of
which
reside
in

and
the
rest
build
in
some
of

eight

and
what
determines

which

visit
us

reoccupy

since
i
have
attended

that

birds
seem
to
maintain

superiority

to
oblige
the

seek
for

the

prevents
their
crowding
the
one
on

whether
the

not
easy
to
say

it

june
dear
sir
the
standing
objection
to
botany
has
always
been
that
it
is
a
pursuit
that
amuses
the
fancy
and
exercises
the
memory
without
improving
the
mind
or
advancing
any
real
knowledge
and
where
the
science
is
carried
no
farther
than
a
mere
systematic
classification
the
charge
is
but
too
true
but
the
botanist
that
is
desirous
of
wiping
off
this
aspersion
should
be
by
no
means
content
with
a
list
of
names
he
should
study
plants
philosophically
should
investigate
the
laws
of
vegetation
should
examine
the
powers
and
virtues
of
efficacious
herbs
should
promote
their
cultivation
and
graft
the
gardener
the
planter
and
the
husbandman
on
the
phytologist
not
that
system
is
by
any

the

to

not

the
vernal
crocus
expands
its
flowers
by
the
beginning

often
in

can

by

dear

from
the
motion
of
birds
the
transition
is
natural
enough
to
their
notes
and
language
of
which
i
shall
say
something
not
that
i
would
pretend
to
understand
their
language
like
the
vizier
who
by
the
recital
of
a
conversation
which
passed
between
two
owls
reclaimed
a
sultan
before
delighting
in
conquest
and
devastation
but
i
would
be
thought
only
to
mean
that
many
of
the
winged
tribes
have
various
sounds
and
voices
adapted
to
express
their
various
passions
wants
and
feelings
such
as
anger
fear
love
hatred
hunger
and
the
like
all
species
are
not
equally
eloquent
some
are
copious
and
fluent
as
it
were
in
their
utterance
while
others
are
confined
to
a
few
important
sounds
no
bird
like
the
fish
kind
is
quite
mute
though
some
are
rather
silent
the
language
of
birds
is
very
ancient

ancient
modes
of

very
elliptical

is

is

shrill

diversified

have
been
often
assured
by
a
curious
observer
of
nature
who
long
resided
at
gibraltar
where
eagles
abound
the
notes
of
our
hawks
much
resemble
those
of
the

have
very
expressive
notes
they
hoot
in
a
fine
vocal
sound
much
resembling
the
vox
humana
and
reducible
by
a
to
a
musical
key
this
note
seems
to
express
complacency
and
rivalry
among
the
males
they
use
also
a
quick
call
and
an
horrible
scream
and
can
snore
and
hiss
when
they
mean
to
menace
ravens
beside
their
loud
croak
can
exert
a
deep
and
solemn
note
that
makes
the

to
echo
the

sound
of

of

the

as
has
been
observed
in
a
former
letter
by
a
shrill
alarm
bespeaks
the
attention
of
the
other

them
be
aware
that

is
at

aquatic
and
gregarious
birds
especially
the
nocturnal

their
quarters
in

very
noisy
and
loquacious
as

and

their
perpetual
clamour
prevents
them
from
dispersing
and
losing
their
companions

so
extensive

therefore
confine

to

attention
but
like
most
of
the
gaudy
birds
his
notes
are
grating
and
shocking
to
the
ear
the
yelling
of
cats
and
the
braying
of
an
ass
are
not
more
disgustful
the
voice
of
the
goose
is
and
clanking
and
once
saved
the
capitol
at

as
grave
historians
assert
the
hiss
also
of
the
gander
is
formidable
and
full
of
menace
and
protective
of
his
young
among
ducks
the
sexual
distinction
of
voice
is
remarkable
for
while
the
quack
of
the
female
is
loud
and
sonorous
the
voice
of
the

is
inward
and
harsh
and
feeble
and
scarce
discernible
the
cock
turkey
struts
and
gobbles
to
his
mistress
in
a
most
uncouth
manner
he
hath
also
a
pert
and
petulant
note
when
he
attacks
his
adversary
when
a
hen
turkey
leads
forth
her
young
brood
she
keeps
a
watchful
eye
and
if
a
bird
of
prey
appear
though
ever
so
high
in
the
air
the
careful
mother
announces
the
enemy
with
a
little
inward
moan
and
watches
him
with
a
steady
and
attentive
look
but
if
he
approach
her
note
becomes
earnest
and
alarming
and
her
outcries
are
redoubled
no
inhabitants
of
a
yard
seem
possessed
of
such
a
variety
of
expression
and
so
copious
a
language
as
common
poultry
take
a
chicken
of
four
or
five
days
old
and
hold
it
up
to
a
window
where
there
are
flies
and
it
will
immediately
seize
its
prey
with
little
twitterings
of
complacency
but
if
you
tender
it
a
wasp
or
a
bee
at
once
its
note
becomes
harsh
and
expressive
of
disapprobation
and
a
sense
of
danger
when
a
pullet
is
ready
to
lay
she
intimates
the
event
by
a
joyous
and
easy
soft
note
of
all
the
occurrences
of
their
life
that
of
laying
seems
to
be
the
most
important
for
no
sooner
has
a
hen
disburdened
herself
than
she
rushes
forth
with
a
clamorous
kind
of
joy
which
the
cock
and
the
rest
of
his
mistresses
immediately
adopt
the
tumult
is
not
confined
to
the
family
concerned
but
catches
from
yard
to
yard
and
spreads
to
every
homestead
within
hearing
till
at
last
the
whole
village
is
in
an
uproar
as
soon
as
a
hen
becomes
a
mother
her
new
relation
demands
a
new
language
she
then
runs
clocking
and
screaming
about
and
seems
agitated
as
if
possessed
the
father
of
the
flock
has
also
a
considerable
vocabulary
if
he
finds
food
he
calls
a
favourite
concubine
to
partake
and
if
a
bird
of
prey
passes
over
with
a
warning
voice
he
bids
his
family
beware
the
gallant
chanticleer
has
at
command
his
amorous
phrases
and
his
terms
of
defiance
but
the
sound
by
which
he
is
best
known
is
his

an

any
person
that
is
curious

might
with
little
trouble
make
two
heliotropes
the

the

these

that
the

makes
to
the

at
the
season
of

now
nothing
would
be
necessary

to
place
these
two
objects
with
so
much
exactness
that
the
westerly

at
setting
might
but
just
clear
the

might
exactly
at
setting
also
clear
the
summer
heliotrope
to
the
north
of
it
by
this
simple
expedient
it
would
soon
appear
that
there
is
no
such
thing
strictly
speaking
as
a
solstice
for
from
the
shortest
day
the
owner
would
every
clear
evening
see
the
disc
advancing
at
its
setting
to
the
westward
of
the
object
and
from
the
longest
day
observe
the

retiring
backwards
every
evening
at
its

in

it

so

of
it
for
when
the

comes

the
whole

a
time
the

would
first
appear

so
every

more

the

yet
the

of

have
slipped

have

with

can

be
accounted

that
happened

justifies
our

which
though
it
befell
not
within
the
limits
of
this
parish
yet
as
it
was
within
the
hundred
of
selborne
and
as
the
circumstances
were
singular
may
fairly
claim
a
place
in
a
work
of
this
nature
the
months
of
january
and
february
in
the
year
were
remarkable
for
great
melting
snows
and
vast
gluts
of
rain
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
latter
month
the
or
lavants
began
to
prevail
and
to
be
near
as
high
as
in
the
memorable
winter
of
the
beginning
of
march
also
went
on
in
the
same
tenor
when
in
the
night
between
the
and
of
that
month
a
considerable
part
of
the
great
woody
hanger
at
hawkley
was
torn
from
its
place
and
fell
down
leaving
a
high
freestone
cliff
naked
and
bare
and
resembling
the
steep
side
of
a
it
appears
that
this
huge
fragment
being
perhaps
sapped
and
undermined
by
waters
foundered
and
was
engulfed
going
down
in
a
perpendicular
direction
for
a

which
stood
in
the
field
on
the
top
of
the

after
sinking
with
its

for
thirty
or
forty
feet
remained
in

side

hundred
yards
lower
on
the

side
of
the

was
a
house
in
which
lived
a
labourer
and
his
family
and
just
by
a
stout
new
barn
the
cottage
was
inhabited
by
an
old
woman
and
her
son
and
his
wife
these
people
in
the
evening
which
was
very
dark
and
tempestuous
observed
that
the
brick
floors
of
their
kitchens
began
to
heave
and
part
and
that
the
walls
seemed
to
open
and
the
roofs
to
crack
but
they
all
agree
that
no
tremor
of
the
ground
indicating
an
earthquake
was
ever
felt
only
that
the
wind
continued
to
make
a
most
tremendous
roaring
in
the
woods
and
hangers
the
miserable
inhabitants
not
daring
to
go
to
bed
remained
in
the
utmost
solicitude
and
confusion
expecting
every
moment
to
be
buried
under
the
ruins
of
their
shattered
edifices
when
came
they
were
at
leisure
to
contemplate
the
devastations
of
the
night
they
then
found
that
a
deep
rift
or
chasm
had
opened
under
their
houses
and
torn
them
as
it
were
in
two
and
that
one
end
of
the
barn
had
suffered
in
a
similar
manner
that
a
pond
near
the
cottage
had
undergone
a
strange
reverse
becoming
deep
at
the
shallow
end
and
so
vice
versa
that
many
large
oaks
were
removed
out
of
their
perpendicular
some
thrown
down
and
some
fallen
into
the
heads
of
neighbouring
trees
and
that
a
gate
was
thrust
forward
with
its
hedge
full
six
feet
so
as
to
require
a
new
track
to
be
made
to
it

the
foot
of

cliff

general
course
of
the
ground
which
is

in
a
moderate
descent
for
half
a
mile
and
is
interspersed
with
some
hillocks
which
were
rifted
in
every
direction
as
well
towards
the
great
woody
hanger
as
from
it
in
the
first
pasture
the
deep
clefts
began
and
running
across
the
lane
and
under
the
buildings
made
such
vast
shelves
that
the
road
was
impassable
for
some
time
and
so
over
to
an
arable
field
on
the
other
side
which
was
strangely
torn
and
disordered
the
second
pasture

being
more
soft
and
springy
was
protruded
forward
without
many
fissures
in
the
turf
which
was
raised
in
long
ridges
resembling
graves
lying
at
right
angles
to
the
motion
at
the
bottom
of
this
enclosure
the
soil
and

rose
many
feet
against
the

there
is
a

field
interspersed
with
furze
close
to
the
back
of
this
village
well
known
by
the
name
of
the
short
lithe
consisting
of
a
rocky
dry
soil
and
inclining
to
the
afternoon
sun
this
spot
abounds
with
the
gryllus
campestris
or
which
though
frequent
in
these
parts
is
by
no
means
a
common
insect
in
many
other
counties
as
their
cheerful
summer
cry
can
not
but
draw
the
attention
of
a
naturalist
i
have
often
gone
down
to
examine
the
oeconomy
of
these
grylli
and
study
their
mode
of
life
but
they
are
so
shy
and
cautious
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
get
a
sight
of
them
for
feeling
a
person
footsteps
as
he
advances
they
stop
short
in
the
midst
of
their
song
and
retire
backward
nimbly
into
their
burrows
where
they
lurk
till
all
suspicion
of
danger
is
over
at
first
we
attempted
to
dig
them
out
with
a
spade
but
without
any
great
success
for
either
we
could
not
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
hole
which
often
terminated
under
a
great
stone
or
else
in
breaking
up
the
ground
we
inadvertently
squeezed
the
poor
insect
to
death
out
of
one
so
bruised
we
took
a
multitude
of
eggs
which
were
long
and
narrow
of
a
yellow
colour
and
covered
with
a
very
tough
skin
by
this
accident
we
learned
to
distinguish
the
male
from
the
female
the
former
of
which
is
shining
black
with
a
golden
stripe
across
his
shoulders
the
latter
is
more
dusky
more
capacious
about
the
abdomen
and
carries
a
long
weapon
at
her
tail
which
probably
is
the
instrument
with
which
she
deposits
her
eggs
in
crannies
and
safe
receptacles
where
violent
methods
will
not
avail
more
gentle
means
will
often
succeed
and
so
it
proved
in
the
present
case
for
though
a
spade
be
too
boisterous
and
rough
an
implement
a
pliant
stalk
of
grass
gently
insinuated
into
the
caverns
will
probe
their
windings
to
the
bottom
and
quickly
bring
out
the
inhabitant
and
thus
the
humane
inquirer
may
gratify
his
curiosity
without
injuring
the
object
of
it
it
is
remarkable
that
though
these
insects
are
furnished
with
long
legs
behind
and
brawny
thighs
for
leaping
like
grasshoppers
yet
when
driven
from
their
holes
they
show
no
activity
but
crawl
along
in
a
shiftless
manner
so
as
easily
to
be
taken
and
again
though
provided
with
a
curious
apparatus
of
wings
yet
they
never
exert
them
when
there
seems
to
be
the
greatest
occasion
the
males
only
make
that
shrilling
noise
perhaps
out
of
rivalry
and
emulation
as
is
the
case
with
many
animals
which
exert
some
sprightly
note
during
their
breeding
time
it
is
raised
by
a
brisk
friction
of
one
wing
against
the
other
they
are

beings

or

as
it
may
happen

there
must
be
a
time
when
the
sexes

then
the

may
be
useful

during

hours
of

when

meet
they
will
fight
fiercely

i
found
by

which
i
put
into
the

of
a
dry

wall
where
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
made
them
settle
for
though
they
seemed
distressed
by
being
taken
out
of
their
knowledge
yet
the
first
that
got
possession
of
the
chinks
would
seize
upon
any
that
were
obtruded
upon
them
with
a
vast
row
of
serrated
fangs
with
their
strong
jaws
toothed
like
the
shears
of
a
lobster
claws
they
perforate
and
round
their
curious
regular
cells
having
no
to
dig
like
the
cricket
when
taken
in
hand
i
could
not
but
wonder
that
they
never
offered
to
defend
themselves
though
armed
with
such
formidable
weapons
of
such
herbs
as
grow
before
the
mouths
of
their
burrows
they
eat
indiscriminately
and
on
a
little
platform
which
they
make
just
by
they
drop
their
dung
and
never
in
the
seem
to
stir
more
than
two
or
three

in

when
they
are

vigorous
they
make
the

echo
and
in
the
stiller
hours
of
darkness
may
be
heard
to
a
considerable
distance
in
the
beginning
of
the

supposed

had
been

impose
on

we

measured

more

feet

never

should

disparity
would
still
increase

must
be

see

furnished

our

record
it
to
have
been
found

it
plainly
appears
that
these

dear
sir
the
old
sussex
tortoise
that
i
have
mentioned
to
you
so
often
is
become
my
property
i
dug
it
out
of
its
winter
dormitory
in
march
last
when
it
was
enough
awakened
to
express
its
resentments
by
hissing
and
packing
it
in
a
box
with
earth
carried
it
eighty
miles
in
the
rattle
and
hurry
of
the
journey
so
perfectly
roused
it
that
when
i
turned
it
out
on
a
border
it
walked
twice
down
to
the
bottom
of
my
garden
however
in
the
evening
the
weather
being
cold
it
buried
itself
in
the
loose
mould
and
continues
still
concealed
as
it
will
be
under
my
eye
i
shall
now
have
an
opportunity
of
enlarging
my
observations
on
its
mode
of
life
and
propensities
and
perceive
already
that
towards
the
time
of
coming
forth
it
opens
a
breathing
place
in
the
ground
near
its
head
requiring
i
conclude
a
freer
respiration
as
it
becomes
more
alive
this
creature
not
only
goes
under
the
earth
from
the
middle
of
november
to
the
middle
of
april
but
sleeps
great
part
of
the
summer
for
it
goes
to
bed
in
the
longest
days
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
often
does
not
stir
in
the
morning
till
late
besides
it
retires
to
rest
for
every
shower
and
does
not
move
at
all
in
wet
days
when
one
reflects
on
the
state
of
this
strange
being
it
is
a
matter
of
wonder
to
find
that
providence
should
bestow
such
a
profusion
of
days
such
a
seeming
waste
of
longevity
on
a
reptile
that
appears
to
relish
it
so
little
as
to
squander
more
than
of
its
existence
in
a
joyless
stupor
and
be
lost
to
all
sensation
for
months
together
in
the
profoundest
of
slumbers
while
i
was
writing
this
letter
a
moist
and
warm
afternoon
with
the
thermometer
at
brought
forth
troupe
of
and
at
the
same
juncture
the
tortoise
heaved
up
the
mould
and
put
out
its
head
and
the
next
morning
came
forth
as
it
were
raised
from
the
dead
and
walked
about
till
four
in
the
afternoon
this
was
a
curious
coincidence
a
very
amusing
occurrence
to
see
such
a
similarity
of
feelings
between
the
two
phereoikoi
in
greek
for
so
the
greeks
call
both
the
and
the
tortoise
summer
birds
are
this
cold
and
backward
spring
unusually
late
i
have
seen
but
one
swallow
yet
this
conformity
with
the
weather
convinces
me
more
and
more
that
they
sleep
in
the
winter
letter
li
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
i
have
now
read
your
miscellanies
through
with
much
care
and
satisfaction
and
am
to
return
you
my
best
thanks
for
the
honourable
mention
made
in
them
of
me
as
a
naturalist
which
i
wish
i
may
deserve
in
some
former
letters
i
expressed
my
suspicions
that
many
of
the
do
not
depart
in
the
winter
far
from
this
village
i
therefore
determined
to
make
some
search
about
the
end
of
the
hill
where
i
imagined
they
might
slumber
out
the
uncomfortable
months
of
winter
but
supposing
that
the
examination
would
be
made
to
the
best
advantage
in
the
spring
and
observing
that
no
martins
had
appeared
by
the
of
april
last
on
that
day
i
employed
some
men
to
explore
the
shrubs
and
cavities
of
the
suspected
spot
the
persons
took
pains
but
without
any
success
however
a
remarkable
incident
occurred
in
the
midst
of
our
the
labourers
were
at
work
a
the
first
that
had
been
seen
this
year
came
down
the
village
in
the
sight
of
several
people
and
went
at
once
into
a
nest
where
it
stayed
a
short
time
and
then
flew
over
the
houses
for
some
days
after
no
martins
were
observed
not
till
the
of
april
and
then
only
a
pair
martins
in
general
were
remarkably
late
this
year
letter
lii
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
selborne
i
have
just
met
with
a
circumstance
respecting
swifts
which
furnishes
an
exception
to
the
whole
tenor
of
my
observations
ever
since
i
have
bestowed
any
attention
on
that
species
of
hirundines
our
swifts
in
general
withdrew
this
year
about
the
first
day
of
august
all
save
one
pair
which
in
two
or
three
days
was
reduced
to
a
single
bird
the
perseverance
of
this
individual
made
me
suspect
that
the
strongest
of
motives
that
of
an
attachment
to
her
young
could
alone
occasion
so
late
a
stay
i
watched
therefore
till
the
of
august
and
then
discovered
that
under
the
eaves
of
the
church
she
attended
upon
two
young
which
were
fledged
and
now
put
out
their
white
chins
from
a
crevice
these
remained
till
the
looking
more
alert
every
day
and
seeming
to
long
to
be
on
the
wing
after
this
day
they
were
missing
at
once
nor
could
i
ever
observe
them
with
their
dam
coursing
round
the
church
in
the
act
of
learning
to
fly
as
the
first
broods
evidently
do
on
the
i
caused
the
eaves
to
be
searched
but
we
found
in
the
nest
only
two
callow
dead
stinking
swifts
on
which
a
second
nest
had
been
formed
this
double
nest
was
full
of
the
black
shining
cases
of
the
hippoboscae
hirundinis
the
following
remarks
on
this
unusual
incident
are
obvious
the
first
is
that
though
it
may
be
disagreeable
to
swifts
to
remain
beyond
the
beginning
of
august
yet
that
they
can
subsist
longer
is
undeniable
the
second
is
that
this
uncommon
event
as
it
was
owing
to
the
loss
of
the
first
brood
so
it
corroborates
my
former
remark
that
swifts
breed
regularly
but
once
since
was
the
contrary
the
case
the
occurrence
above
could
neither
be
new
nor
rare
one
swift
was
seen
at
lyndon
in
the
county
of
rutland
in
so
late
as
the
third
of
september
letter
liii
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
as
i
have
sometimes
known
you
make
inquiries
about
several
kinds
of
insects
i
shall
here
send
you
an
account
of
one
sort
which
i
little
expected
to
have
found
in
this
kingdom
i
had
often
observed
that
one
particular
part
of
a
vine
growing
on
the
walls
of
my
house
was
covered
in
the
autumn
with
a
black
appearance
on
which
the
flies
fed
eagerly
and
that
the
shoots
and
leaves
thus
affected
did
not
thrive
nor
did
the
fruit
ripen
to
this
substance
i
applied
my
glasses
but
could
not
discover
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
animal
life
as
i
at
first
expected
but
upon
a
closer
examination
behind
the
larger
boughs
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
they
were
coated
over
with
husky
shells
from
whose
sides
proceeded
a
substance
surrounding
a
multitude
of
eggs
this
curious
and
uncommon
production
put
me
upon
recollecting
what
i
have
heard
and
read
concerning
the
coccus
vitis
viniferae
of
linnaeus
which
in
the
south
of
europe
infests
many
vines
and
is
an
horrid
and
loathsome
pest
as
soon
as
i
had
turned
to
the
accounts
given
of
this
insect
i
saw
at
once
that
it
swarmed
on
my
vine
and
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
checked
by
the
preceding
winter
which
had
been
uncommonly
severe
not
being
then
at
all
aware
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
england
i
was
much
inclined
to
think
that
it
came
from
gibraltar
among
the
many
boxes
and
packages
of
plants
and
birds
which
i
had
formerly
received
from
thence
and
especially
as
the
vine
infested
grew
immediately
under
my
where
i
usually
kept
my
specimens
true
it
is
that
i
had
received
nothing
from
thence
for
some
years
but
as
insects
we
know
are
conveyed
from
one
country
to
another
in
a
very
unexpected
manner
and
have
a
wonderful
power
of
maintaining
their
existence
till
they
fall
into
a
nidus
proper
for
their
support
and
increase
i
can
not
but
suspect
still
that
these
cocci
came
to
me
originally
from
andalusia
yet
all
the
while
candour
obliges
me
to
confess
that
lightfoot
has
written
me
word
that
he
once
and
but
once
saw
these
insects
on
a
vine
at
weymouth
in
dorsetshire
which
it
is
here
to
be
observed
is
a
seaport
town
to
which
the
coccus
might
be
conveyed
by
shipping
as
many
of
my
readers
may
possibly
never
have
heard
of
this
strange
and
unusual
insect
i
shall
here
transcribe
a
passage
from
a
natural
history
of
gibraltar
written
by
the
reverend
john
white
late
vicar
of
blackburn
in
lancashire
but
not
yet
published
the
year
a
vine
which
grew
on
the
east
side
of
my
house
and
which
had
produced
the
finest
crops
of
grapes
for
years
past
was
suddenly
overspread
on
all
the
woody
branches
with
large
lumps
of
a
white
fibrous
substance
resembling
spiders
webs
or
rather
raw
cotton
it
was
of
a
very
clammy
quality
sticking
fast
to
everything
that
touched
it
and
capable
of
being
spun
into
long
threads
at
first
i
suspected
it
to
be
the
product
of
spiders
but
could
find
none
nothing
was
to
be
seen
connected
with
it
but
many
brown
oval
husky
shells
which
by
no
means
looked
like
insects
but
rather
resembled
bits
of
the
dry
bark
of
the
vine
the
tree
had
a
plentiful
crop
of
grapes
set
when
this
pest
appeared
upon
it
but
the
fruit
was
manifestly
injured
by
this
foul
incumbrance
it
remained
all
the
summer
still
increasing
and
loaded
the
woody
and
bearing
branches
to
a
vast
degree
i
often
pulled
off
great
quantities
by
handfuls
but
it
was
so
slimy
and
tenacious
that
it
could
by
no
means
be
cleared
the
grapes
never
filled
to
their
natural
perfection
but
turned
watery
and
vapid
upon
perusing
the
works
afterwards
of
de
reaumur
i
found
this
matter
perfectly
described
and
accounted
for
those
husky
shells
which
i
had
observed
were
no
other
than
the
female
coccus
from
whose
sides
this
substance
exudes
and
serves
as
a
covering
and
security
for
their
eggs
to
this
account
i
think
proper
to
add
that
though
the
female
cocci
are
stationary
and
seldom
remove
from
the
place
to
which
they
stick
yet
the
male
is
a
winged
insect
and
that
the
black
dust
which
i
saw
was
undoubtedly
the
excrement
of
the
females
which
is
eaten
by
ants
as
well
as
flies
though
the
utmost
severity
of
our
winter
did
not
destroy
these
insects
yet
the
attention
of
the
gardener
in
a
summer
or
two
has
entirely
relieved
my
vine
from
this
filthy
annoyance
as
we
have
remarked
above
that
insects
are
often
conveyed
from
one
country
to
another
in
a
very
unaccountable
manner
i
shall
here
mention
an
emigration
of
small
aphides
which
was
observed
in
the
village
of
selborne
no
longer
ago
than
august
the
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
which
was
very
hot
the
people
of
this
village
were
surprised
by
a
shower
of
aphides
or
which
fell
in
these
parts
those
that
were
walking
in
the
street
at
that
juncture
found
themselves
covered
with
these
insects
which
settled
also
on
the
hedges
and
gardens
blackening
all
the
vegetables
where
they
alighted
my
annuals
were
discoloured
with
them
and
the
stalks
of
a
bed
of
onions
were
quite
coated
over
for
six
days
after
these
armies
were
then
no
doubt
in
a
state
of
emigration
and
shifting
their
quarters
and
might
have
come
as
far
as
we
know
from
the
great
of
kent
or
sussex
the
wind
being
all
that
day
in
the
easterly
quarter
they
were
observed
at
the
same
time
in
great
clouds
about
farnham
and
all
along
the
vale
from
farnham
to
alton
for
various
methods
by
which
several
insects
shift
their
quarters

barrington
dear
sir
when
i
happen
to
visit
a
family
where
gold
and
silver
fishes
are
kept
in
a
glass
bowl
i
am
always
pleased
with
the
occurrence
because
it
offers
me
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
actions
and
propensities
of
those
beings
with
whom
we
can
be
little
acquainted
in
their
natural
state
not
long
since
i
spent
a
fortnight
at
the
house
of
a
friend
where
there
was
such
a
vivary
to
which
i
paid
no
small
attention
taking
every
occasion
to
remark
what
passed
within
its
narrow
limits
it
was
here
that
i
first
observed
the
manner
in
which
fishes
die
as
soon
as
the
creature
sickens
the
head
sinks
lower
and
lower
and
it
stands
as
it
were
on
its
head
till
getting
weaker
and
losing
all
poise
the
tail
turns
over
and
at
last
it
floats
on
the
surface
of
the
water
with
its
belly
uppermost
the
reason
why
fishes
when
dead
swim
in
that
manner
is
very
obvious
because
when
the
body
is
no
longer
balanced
by
the
fins
of
the
belly
the
broad
muscular
back
preponderates
by
its
own
gravity
and
turns
the
belly
uppermost
as
lighter
from
its
being
a
cavity
and
because
it
contains
the
which
contribute
to
render
it
buoyant
some
that
delight
in
gold
and
silver
fishes
have
adopted
a
notion
that
they
need
no
aliment
true
it
is
that
they
will
subsist
for
a
long
time
without
any
apparent
food
but
what
they
can
collect
from
pure
water
frequently
changed
yet
they
must
draw
some
support
from
animalcula
and
other
nourishment
supplied
by
the
water
because
though
they
seem
to
eat
nothing
yet
the
consequences
of
eating
often
drop
from
them
that
they
are
best
pleased
with
such
jejune
diet
may
easily
be
confuted
since
if
you
toss
them
crumbs
they
will
seize
them
with
great
readiness
not
to
say
greediness
however
bread
should
be
given
sparingly
lest
turning
sour
it
corrupt
the
water
they
will
also
feed
on
the
plant
called
lemna
duck
meat
and
also
on
small
fry
when
they
want
to
move
a
little
they
gently
protrude
themselves
with
their
pinnae
pectorales
but
it
is
with
their
strong
muscular
tails
only
that
they
and
all
fishes
shoot
along
with
such
inconceivable
rapidity
it
has
been
said
that
the
eyes
of
fishes
are
immoveable
but
these
apparently
turn
them
forward
or
backward
in
their
sockets
as
their
occasions
require
they
take
little
notice
of
a
lighted
candle
though
applied
close
to
their
heads
but
flounce
and
seem
much
frightened
by
a
sudden
stroke
of
the
hand
against
the
support
whereon
the
bowl
is
hung
especially
when
they
have
been
motionless
and
are
perhaps
asleep
as
fishes
have
no
eyelids
it
is
not
easy
to
discern
when
they
are
sleeping
or
not
because
their
eyes
are
always
open
nothing
can
be
more
amusing
than
a
glass
bowl
containing
such
fishes
the
double
refractions
of
the
glass
and
water
represent
them
when
moving
in
a
shifting
and
changeable
variety
of
dimensions
shades
and
colours
while
the
two
mediums
assisted
by
the
shape
of
the
vessel
magnify
and
distort
them
vastly
not
to
mention
that
the
introduction
of
another
element
and
its
inhabitants
into
our
parlours
engages
the
fancy
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
gold
and
silver
fishes
though
originally
natives
of
china
and
japan
yet
are
become
so
well
reconciled
to
our
climate
as
to
thrive
and
multiply
very
fast
in
our
ponds
and
stews
linnaeus
ranks
this
species
of
fish
under
the
genus
of
cyprinus
or
carp
and
calls
it
cyprinus
auratus
some
people
exhibit
this
sort
of
fish
in
a
very
fanciful
way
for
they
cause
a
glass
bowl
to
be
blown
with
a
large
hollow
space
within
that
does
not
communicate
with
it
in
this
cavity
they
put
a
bird
occasionally
so
that
you
may
see
a
goldfinch
or
a
linnet
hopping
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
the
water
and
the
fishes
swimming
in
a
circle
round
it
the
simple
exhibition
of
the
fishes
is
agreeable
and
pleasant
but
in
so
complicated
a
way
becomes
whimsical
and
unnatural
and
liable
to
the
objection
due
to
him

letter

to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
october
dear
sir
i
think
i
have
observed
before
that
much
the
most
considerable
part
of
the
withdraw
from
hence
about
the
first
week
in
october
but
that
some
the
latter
broods
i
am
now
convinced
linger
on
till
towards
the
middle
of
that
month
and
that
at
times
once
perhaps
in
two
or
three
years
a
flight
for
one
day
only
has
shown
itself
in
the
first
week
of
november
having
taken
notice
in
october
that
the
last
flight
was
numerous
amounting
perhaps
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
that
the
season
was
soft
and
still
i
was
resolved
to
pay
uncommon
attention
to
these
late
birds
to
find
if
possible
where
they
roosted
and
to
determine
the
precise
time
of
their
retreat
the
mode
of
life
of
these
latter
hirundines
is
very
favourable
to
such
a
design
for
they
spend
the
whole
day
in
the
sheltered
district
between
me
and
the
hanger
sailing
about
in
a
placid
easy
manner
and
feasting
on
those
insects
which
love
to
haunt
a
spot
so
secure
from
ruffling
winds
as
my
principal
object
was
to
discover
the
place
of
their
roosting
i
took
care
to
wait
on
them
before
they
retired
to
rest
and
was
much
pleased
to
find
that
for
several
evenings
together
just
at
a
quarter
past
five
in
the
afternoon
they
all
scudded
away
in
great
haste
towards
the
and
darted
down
among
the
low
shrubs
above
the
cottages
at
the
end
of
the
hill
this
spot
in
many
respects
seems
to
be
well
calculated
for
their
winter
residence
for
in
many
parts
it
is
as
steep
as
the
roof
of
any
house
and
therefore
secure
from
the
annoyances
of
water
and
it
is
moreover
clothed
with
beechen
shrubs
which
being
stunted
and
bitten
by
sheep
make
the
thickest
covert
imaginable
and
are
so
entangled
as
to
be
impervious
to
the
smallest
spaniel
besides
it
is
the
nature
of
underwood
beech
never
to
cast
its
leaf
all
the
winter
so
that
with
the
leaves
on
the
ground
and
those
on
the
twigs
no
shelter
can
be
more
complete
i
watched
them
on
to
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
of
october
and
found
their
evening
retreat
was
exact
and
uniform
but
after
this
they
made
no
regular
appearance
now
and
then
a
straggler
was
seen
and
on
the
of
october
i
observed
two
in
the
morning
over
the
village
and
with
them
my
remarks
for
the
season
ended
from
all
these
circumstances
put
together
it
is
more
than
probable
that
this
lingering
flight
at
so
late
a
season
of
the
year
never
departed
from
the
island
had
they
indulged
me
that
autumn
with
a
november
visit
as
i
much
desired
i
presume
that
with
proper
assistants
i
should
have
settled
the
matter
past
all
doubt
but
though
the
third
of
november
was
a
sweet
day
and
in
appearance
exactly
suited
to
my
wishes
yet
not
a
martin
was
to
be
seen
and
so
i
was
forced
reluctantly
to
give
up
the
pursuit
i
have
only
to
add
that
were
the
bushes
which
cover
some
acres
and
are
not
my
own
property
to
be
grubbed
and
carefully
examined
probably
those
late
broods
and
perhaps
the
whole
aggregate
body
of
the
of
this
district
might
be
found
there
in
different
secret
dormitories
and
that
so
far
from
withdrawing
into
warmer
climes
it
would
appear
that
they
never
depart
three
hundred
yards
from
the
village

they
who
write
on
natural
history
can
not
too
frequently
advert
to
instinct
that
wonderful
limited
faculty
which
in
some
instances
raises
the
brute
creation
as
it
were
above
reason
and
in
others
leaves
them
so
far
below
it
philosophers
have
defined
instinct
to
be
chat
secret
influence
by
which
every
species
is
impelled
naturally
to
pursue
at
all
times
the
same
way
or
track
without
any
teaching
or
example
whereas
reason
without
instruction
would
often
vary
and
do
chat
by
many
methods
which
instinct
effects
by
one
alone
now
this
maxim
must
be
taken
in
a
qualified
sense
for
there
are
instances
in
which
instinct
does
vary
and
conform
to
the
circumstances
of
place
and
convenience
it
has
been
remarked
chat
every
species
of
bird
has
a
mode
of
nidification
peculiar
to
itself
so
that
a
schoolboy
would
at
once
pronounce
on
the
sort
of
nest
before
him
this
is
the
case
among
fields
and
woods
and
wilds
but
in
the
villages
round
london
where
mosses
and
gossamer
and
cotton
from
vegetables
are
hardly
to
be
found
the
nest
of
the
chaffinch
has
not
that
elegant
finished
appearance
nor
is
it
so
beautifully
studded
with
lichens
as
in
a
more
rural
district
and
the
wren
is
obliged
to
construct
its
house
with
straws
and
dry
grasses
which
do
not
give
it
that
rotundity
and
compactness
so
remarkable

where
a
rafter

may
happen

stand
in
the
way
the
nest
is
so
contrived
as
to
conform
to
the
obstruction
and
becomes
flat
or
oval
or
compressed
in

following
instances

is
perfectly
uniform
and
consistent
there
are
three
creatures
the
squirrel
the
and
the
bird
called
the
sitta
europaea
which
live
much
on
hazel
nuts
and
yet
they
open
them

in
a
different
way
the
first

rasping
off
the
small
end
splits
the

with
his
long
as

man
does

the
second
nibbles
a

with
his
teeth

regular
as

drilled

wimble

so
small
that
one
would
wonder
how
the
kernel
can
be
extracted
through
it

the
last
picks
an
irregular
ragged
hole
with
its
bill

as
this
artist
has
no
paws
to
hold
the
nut
firm
while
he
pierces
it
like

adroit
workman
he
fixes
it
as
it
were
in

some
cleft
of
a
tree

in
some
crevice
when
standing
over
it

that

the
theory

this
curious
quotation
strikes
me
much
by
so
well
representing
my

by

what
i

by

bird
frequents
my

which
i
have
great
reason
to
think
is
the
pettichaps
it
is
common
in
some
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
i
have
received
formerly
several
dead
specimens
from

this
bird
much
resembles
the

has
a

silvery
breast
and

active
like

one
of
my
neighbours
an
intelligent
and
observing
man
informs
me
that
in
the
beginning
of
may
and
about
ten
minutes
before
eight
in
the
evening
he
discovered
a
great
cluster
of
swallows
thirty
at
least
he
supposes
perching
on
a
willow
that
hung
over
the
verge
of
james
knight
his
attention
was
first
drawn
by
the
twittering
of
these
birds
which
sat
motionless
in
a
row
on
the
bough
with
their
heads
all
one
way
and
by
their
weight
pressing
down
the
twig
so
that
it
nearly
touched
the
water
in
this
situation
he
watched
them
till
he
could
see
no
longer
repeated
accounts
of
this
sort
spring
and
fall
induce
us
greatly
to
suspect
that
have
some
strong
attachment
to
water
independent
of
the
matter
of
food
and
though
they
may
not
retire
into
that
element
yet
they
may
conceal
themselves
in
the
banks
of
pools
and
rivers

uncomfortable
months
of

of

was
killed
in
the
neighbouring
parish
of

and
sent
by
me
to
pennant
into
north
wales
since
that
time
i
have
met
with
none
till
now
the
specimen
measured
above
was
in
fine
preservation
and
not
injured
by
the
shot
it
measured
inches
from
wing
to
wing
and
from
beak
to
tail
and
weighed
two
pounds
and
an
half
standing
weight
this
species
is
very
robust
and
wonderfully
formed
for
rapine
its
breast
was
plump
and
muscular
its
thighs
long
thick
and
brawny
and
its
legs
remarkably
short
and
well
set
the
feet
were
armed
with
most
formidable
sharp
long
talons
the
eyelids
and
cere
of
the
bill
were
yellow
but
the
irides
of
the
eyes
dusky
the
beak
was
thick

hooked
and
of
a
dark
colour
and
had
a
jagged
process
near
the
end
of
the
upper
mandible
on
each
side
its
tail

train
was
short
in
proportion
to
the
bulk
of
its
body
yet
the
wings
when
closed
did
not
extend
to
the
end
of
the
train
from
its
large
and
fair
proportions
it
might
be
supposed
to
have
been
a
female
but
i
was
not
permitted
to
cut
open
the
specimen

one
of
the
birds
of
prey
which
are
usually
lean
this
was
in
high

in
its

probably
came
from

on
which

but
when

was
probably
driven
from

my
near
neighbour
a
young
gentleman
in
the
service
of
the
india
company
has
brought
home
a
dog
and
a
bitch
of
the
chinese
breed
from
canton
such
as
are
fattened
in
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
being
eaten
they
are
about
the
size
of
a
moderate
spaniel
of
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
coarse
bristling
hairs
on
their
backs
sharp
upright
ears
and
peaked
heads
which
give
them
a
very
appearance
their
hind
legs
are
unusually
straight
without
any
bend
at
the
hock
or
ham
to
such
a
degree
as
to
give
them
an
awkward
gait
when
they
trot
when
they
are
in
motion
their
tails
are
curved
high
over
their
backs
like
those
of
some
hounds
and
have
a
bare
place
each
on
the
outside
from
the
tip
midway
that
does
not
seem
to
be
matter
of
accident
but
somewhat
singular
their
eyes
are
jet
black
small
and
piercing
the
insides
of
their
lips
and
mouths
of
the
same
colour
and
their
tongues
blue
the
bitch
has
a
on
each
hind
leg
the
dog
has
none
when
taken
out
into
a
field
the
bitch
showed
some
disposition
for
hunting
and
dwelt
on
the
scent
of
a
covey
of
partridges
till
she
sprung
them
giving
her
tongue
all
the
time
the
dogs
in
south
america
are
dumb
but
these
bark
much
in
a
short
thick
manner
like
foxes
and
have
a
surly
savage
demeanour
like
their
ancestors
which
are
not
domesticated
but
bred
up
in
sties
where
they
are
fed
for
the
table
with
and
other
farinaceous
food
these
dogs
having
been
taken
on
board
as
soon
as
weaned
could
not
learn
much
from
their
dam
yet
they
did
not
relish
flesh
when
they
came
to
england
in
the
islands
of
the
pacific
ocean
the
dogs
are
bred
up
on
vegetables
and
would
not
eat
flesh
when
offered
them
by
our
circumnavigators
we
believe
that
all
dogs
in
a
state
of
nature
have
sharp
upright
ears
and
that
hanging
ears
which
are
esteemed
so
graceful
are
the
effect
of
choice
breeding
and
cultivation
thus
in

dogs
which

now
we
are
upon
the
subject
of
dogs
it
may
not
be
impertinent
to
add
that
spaniels
as
all
sportsmen
know
though
they
hunt
partridges
and
pheasants
as
it
were
by
instinct
and
with
much
delight
and
alacrity
yet
will
hardly
touch
their
bones
when
offered
as
food
nor
will
a
mongrel
dog
of
my
own
though
he
is
remarkable
for
ending
that
sort
of
game
but
when
we
came
to
offer
the
bones
of
partridges
to
the
two
chinese
dogs
they
devoured
them
with
much
greediness
and
licked
the
platter
clean
no
sporting
dogs
will
flush
woodcocks
till
inured
to
the
scent
and
trained
to
the
sport
which
they
then
pursue
with
vehemence
and
transport
but
then
they
will
not
touch
their
bones
but
turn
from
them
with
abhorrence
even
when
they
are
hungry
now
that
dogs
should
not
be
fond
of
the
bones
of
such
birds
as
they
are
not
disposed
to
hunt
is
no
wonder
but
why
they
reject
and
do
not
care
to
eat
their
natural
game
is
not
so
easily
accounted
for
since
the
end
of
hunting
seems
to
be
that
the
chase
pursued
should
be
eaten
dogs
again
will
not
devour
the
more
rancid
nor
indeed
the
bones
of
any
nor
will
they
touch
the
foetid
bodies
of
birds
that
feed
on
offal
and
garbage
and
indeed
there
may
be
somewhat
of
providential
instinct
in
this
circumstance
of
dislike
for
vultures
and
kites
and
ravens
and
crows
were
intended
to
be
messmates

stumble
upon
a
log
i
have
just
seen
a
piece
which
was
sent
by
a
labourer
of
oakhanger
to
a
carpenter
of
this
village
this
was
the
of
a
small
oak
about
five
feet
long
and
about
five
inches
in
diameter
it
had
apparently
been
severed
from
the
ground
by
an
axe
was
very
ponderous
and
as
black
as
ebony
upon
asking
the
carpenter
for
what
purpose
he
had
procured
it
he
told
me
that
it
was
to
be
sent
to
his
brother
a
joiner
at
farnham
who
was
to
make
use
of
it
in
cabinet
work
by
inlaying
it
along
with
whiter
woods
those
that
are
much
abroad
on
evenings
after
it
is
dark

spring
and
summer
frequently
hear
a
nocturnal
bird
passing
by
on
the
wing
and
repeating
often
a
short
quick
note
this
bird
i
have
remarked
myself
but
never
could
make
out
till
lately
i
am
assured
now
that
it
is
the
stone
curlew
charadrius

some
of
them
pass
over

be

strings
from
the
foraging
of
the

and
rendezvous
by
thousands

where
they
wheel
round
in
the
air
and
sport
and
dive
in
a
playful
manner
all
the
while
exerting
their
voices
and
making
a
loud
cawing
which
being
blended
and
softened
by
the
distance
that
we
at
the
village
are
below
them
becomes
a
confused
noise
or
chiding
or
rather
a
pleasing
murmur
very
engaging
to
the
imagination

the

in

i
find
by
those
curious
and
accurate
remarks
which
contain
an
account
of
the
weather
from
the
year
to
the
year
inclusive
that
though
there
is
frequent
rain
in
that
district
of
devonshire
yet
the
quantity
falling
is
not
great
and
that
some
years
it
has
been
very
small
for
in
the
rain
measured
only
in
and
in
in
and
again
in
only
in
places
near
the
sea
have
frequent
scuds
that
keep
the
atmosphere
moist
yet
do
not
reach
far
up
into
the
country
making
thus
the
maritime
situations
appear
wet
when
the
rain
is
not
considerable
in
the
wettest
years
at
plymouth
the
doctor
measured
only
once
in
and
again
once
in
a
quantity
of
rain
that
has
twice
been
exceeded
at
selborne
in
the
short
period
of
my
observations
huxham
remarks
that
frequent
small
rains
keep
the
air
moist
while
heavy
ones
render
it
more
dry
by
beating
down
the
vapours
he
is
also
of
opinion
that
the
dingy
smoky
appearance
of
the
sky
in
very
dry
seasons
arises
from
the
want
of
moisture
sufficient
to
let
the
light
through
and
render
the
atmosphere
transparent
because
he
had
observed
several
bodies
more
diaphanous
when
wet
than
dry
and
did
never
recollect
that
the
air
had
that
look
in
rainy
seasons
my
friend
who
lives
just
beyond
the
top
of
the
down
brought
his
three
swivel
guns
to
try
them
in
my
outlet
with
their
muzzles
towards
the
hanger
supposing
that
the
report
would
have
had
a
great
effect
but
the
experiment
did
not
answer
his
expectation
he
then
removed
them
to
the
alcove
on
the
hanger
when
the
sound
rushing
along
the
lythe
and
combwood
was
very
grand
but
it
was
at
the
hermitage
that
the
echoes
and
repercussions
delighted
the
hearers
not
only
filling
the
lythe
with
the
roar
as
if
all
the
beeches
were
tearing
up
by
the
roots
but
turning
to
the
left
they
pervaded
the
vale
above
and
after
a
pause
seemed
to
take
up
the
crash
again
and
to
extend
round
hangers
and
to
die
away
at
last
among
the
coppices
and
coverts
of
ward
le
ham
it
has
been
remarked
before
that
this
district
is
an
anathoth
a
place
of
responses
or
echoes
and
therefore
proper
for
such
experiments
we
may
further
add
that
the
pauses
in
echoes
when
they
cease
and
yet
are
taken
up
again
like
the
pauses
in
music
surprise
the
hearers
and
have
a
fine
effect
on
the
imagination
the
gentleman
above
mentioned
has
just
fixed
a
barometer
in
his
parlour
at
newton
valence
the
tube
was
first
filled
here
at
selborne
twice
with
care
when
the
mercury
agreed
and
stood
exactly
with
my
own
but
being
filled
again
twice
at
newton
the
mercury
stood
on
account
of
the
great
elevation
of
that
house
of
an
inch
lower
than
the
barometers
at
this
village
and
so
continues
to
do
be
the
weight
of
the
atmosphere
what
it
may
the
plate
of
the
barometer
at
newton
is
figured
as
low
as
because
in
stormy
weather
the
mercury
there
will
sometimes
descend
below
we
have
supposed
to
stand
two
hundred
feet
higher
than
this
house
but
if
the
rule
holds
good
which
says
that
mercury
in
a
barometer
sinks
of
an
inch
for
every
hundred
feet
elevation
then
the
newton
barometer
by
standing
lower
than
that
of
selborne
proves
that
must
be
three
hundred
feet
higher
than
that
in
which
i
am
writing
instead
of
two
hundred
it
may
not
be
impertinent
to
add
that
the
barometers
at
selborne
stand
of
an
inch
lower
than
the
barometers
at
south
lambeth
whence
we
may
conclude
that
the
former
place
is
about
three
hundred
feet
higher
than
the
latter
and
with
good
reason
because
the
streams
that
rise
with
us
run
into
the
thames
at
weybridge
and
so
to
london
of
course
therefore
there
must
be
lower
ground
all
the
way
from
selborne
to
sough
lambeth
the
distance
between
which
all
the
windings
and
indentings
of
the
streams
considered
can
not
be
less
than
an
hundred

letter
lxi
to
the
honourable
daines
barrington
since
the
weather
of
a
district
is
undoubtedly
part
of
its
natural
history
i
shall
make
no
further
apology
for
the
four
following
letters
which
will
contain
many
particulars
concerning
some
of
the
great
frosts
and
a
few
respecting
some
very
hot
summers
that
have
distinguished
themselves
from
the
rest
during
the
course
of
my
observations
as
the
frost
in
january
was
for
the
small
it
lasted
the
most
severe
that
we
had
then
known
for
many
years
and
was
remarkably
injurious
to
evergreens
some
account
of
its
rigour
and
reason
of
its
ravages
may
be
useful
and
not
unacceptable
to
persons
that
delight
in
planting
and
ornamenting
and
may
particularly
become
a
work
that
professes
never
to
lose
sight
of
utility
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
of
the
former
year
there
were
considerable
falls
of
snow
which
lay
deep
and
uniform
on
the
ground
without
any
drifting
wrapping
up
the
more
humble
vegetation
in
perfect
security
from
the
first
day
to
the
fifth
of
the
new
year
more
snow
succeeded
but
from
that
day
the
air
became
entirely
clear
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
about
noon
had
a
considerable
influence
in
sheltered
situations
it
was
in
such
an
aspect
that
the
snow
on
the
author
evergreens
was
melted
every
day
and
frozen
intensely
every
night
so
that
the
laurustines
bays
laurels
and
arbutuses
looked
in
three
or
four
days
as
if
they
had
been
burnt
in
the
fire
while
a
plantation
of
the
same
kind
in
a
high
cold
situation
where
the
snow
was
never
melted
at
all
remained
uninjured
from
hence
i
would
infer
that
it
is
the
repeated
melting
and
freezing
of
the
snow
that
is
so
fatal
to
vegetation
rather
than
the
severity
of
the
cold
therefore
it
highly
behaves
every
planter
who
wishes
to
escape
the
cruel
mortification
of
losing
in
a
few
days
the
labour
and
hopes
of
years
to
bestir
himself
on
such
emergencies
and
if
his
plantations
are
small
to
avail
himself
of
mats
cloths
straw
reeds
or
any
such
covering
for
a
short
time
or
if
his
shrubberies
are
extensive
to
see
that
his
people
go
about
with
prongs
and
forks
and
carefully
dislodge
the
snow
from
the
boughs
since
the
naked
foliage
will
shift
much
better
for
itself
than
where
the
snow
is
partly
melted
and
frozen
again
it
may
perhaps
appear
at
first
like
a
paradox
but
doubtless
the
more
tender
trees
and
shrubs
should
never
be
planted
in
hot
aspects
not
only
for
the
reason
assigned
above
but
also
because
thus
circumstanced
they
are
disposed
to
shoot
earlier
in
the
spring
and
grow
on
later
in
the
autumn
than
they
would
otherwise
do
and
so
are
sufferers
by
lagging
or
early
frosts
for
this
reason
also
plants
from
siberia
will
hardly
endure
our
climate
because
on
the
very
first
advances
of
spring
they
shoot
away
and
so
are
cut
off
by
the
severe
nights
of
march
or
april
fothergill
and
others
have
experienced
the
same
inconvenience
with
respect
to
the
more
tender
shrubs
from
north
america
which
they
therefore
plant
under
north
walls
there
should
also
perhaps
be
a
wall
to
the
east
to
defend
them
from
the
piercing
blasts
from
that
quarter
this
observation
might
without
any
impropriety
be
carried
into
animal
life
for
discerning
now
find
that
their
hives
should
not
in
the
winter
be
exposed
to
the
hot
sun
because
such
unseasonable
warmth
awakens
the
inhabitants
too
early
from
their
slumbers
and
by
putting
their
juices
into
motion
too
soon
subjects
them
afterwards
to
inconveniences
when
rigorous
weather

coincidents

this
short
but
intense

it

said

though

to

by
somewhat
of
a
regular
gradation
yet
thaws
do
not
usually
come
on
by
as
regular
a
declension
of
cold

often
take
place

intense
freezing

there
were
some
circumstances
attending
the
remarkable
frost
in
january
so
singular
and
striking
that
a
short
detail
of
them
may
not
be
unacceptable
the
most
certain
way
to
be
exact
will
be
to
copy
the
passages
from
my
journal
which
were
taken
from
time
to
time
as
things
occurred
but
it
may
be
proper
previously
to
remark
that
the
first
week
in
january
was
uncommonly
wet
and
drowned
with
vast
rains
from
every
quarter
from
whence
may
be
inferred
as
there
is
great
reason
to
believe
is
the
case
that
intense
frosts
seldom
take
place
till
the
earth
is
perfectly
glutted
and
chilled
with
water
and
hence
dry
autumns
are
seldom
followed
by
rigorous
winters
the
autumn
preceding
january
was
very
wet
and
particularly
the
month
of
september
during
which
there
fell
at
lyndon
in
the
county
of
rutland
six
inches
and
an
half
of
rain

the
terrible
long

of

were

high

was
followed
by

the
when

overwhelmed

over

narrow
roads
were
now
filled
above
the
tops
of
the
hedges
through
which
the
snow
was
driven
into
most
romantic
and
grotesque
shapes
so
striking
to
the
imagination
as
not
to
be
seen
without
wonder
and
pleasure

poultry
dared
not
to
stir

their

so
dazzled
and
confounded
by
the
glare
of
snow
that
they
would
soon
perish
without
assistance
the
hares
also
lay
sullenly
in
their
seats
and
would
not
move
until

hunger

that
the
drifts
and
heaps
treacherously
betray
their
footsteps

prove
fatal

them

the
snow
continued
to
increase
and
began
to
stop
the
road

and
coaches

could
no
longer
keep
on
their
regular
stages

western

to
have
been

fell

on
the
january
just
before
sunrise
with
rime
on
the
trees
and
on
the
tube
of

the
quicksilver
sunk
exactly
to

being
degrees
below

point
but
by
eleven
in
the
morning
though
in
the
shade
it
sprung
up
to
a
most
unusual
degree
of
cold
this
for
the
south
of
england
during
these
four
nights
the
cold
was
so
penetrating
that
it
occasioned
ice
in
warm
chambers
and
under
beds
and
in
the
day
the
wind
was
so
keen
that
persons
of
robust
constitutions
could
scarcely
endure
to
face
it
the
thames
was
at
once
so
frozen
over
both
above
and
below
bridge
that
crowds
ran
about
on
the
ice
the
streets
were
now
strangely
incumbered
with
snow
which
crumbled
and
trod
dusty
and
turning
grey
resembled
what
had
fallen
on
the
roofs
was
so
perfectly
dry
that
from
first
to
last
it
lay
days
on
the
houses
in
the
city
a
longer
time
than
had
been
remembered
by
the
oldest
housekeepers
living
according
to
all
appearances
we
might
now
have
expected
the
continuance
of
this
rigorous
weather
for
weeks
to
come
since
every
night
increased
in
severity
but
behold
without
any
apparent
cause
on
the
of
february
a
thaw
took
place
and
some
rain
followed
before
night
making
good
the
observation
above
that
frosts
often
go
off
as
it
were
at
once
without
any
gradual
declension
of
cold
on
the
second
of

the
thaw
persisted
and
on
the
swarms
of
little
insects
were
frisking
and
sporting
in
a

lambeth
as
if
they
had
felt
no
frost
why
the
juices
in
the
small
bodies
and
smaller
limbs
of
such
minute
beings
are
not
frozen
is
a
matter
of
curious
inquiry
at
selborne
the
cold
was
greater
than
at
any
other
place
that
the
author
could
hear
of
with
certainty
though
some
reported
at
the
time
that
at
a
village
in
kent
the
thermometer
fell
two
degrees
below
zero

severe
frosts
seem
to
be
partial
or
to
run
in
currents
for
at
the
same
juncture
as
the
author
was
informed
by
accurate
correspondents
at
lyndon
in
the
county
of
rutland
the
thermometer
stood
at
at
blackburn
in
lancashire
at
and
at
manchester
at
and
thus
does
some
unknown
circumstance
strangely
overbalance
latitude
and
render
the
cold
sometimes
much
greater
in
the
southern
than
in
the
northern

of

the

letter

to
the

as
the
frost
in

was
very
extraordinary
you
i

not
be
displeased
to
hear
the
particulars
and
especially
when
i
promise
to
say
no
more
about
the
severities
of
winter
after
i
have
finished
this
letter
the
first
week
in

was
very
wet
with
the
barometer
very
low
on
the

the

at
came
on
a
vast
snow
which
continued
all
that
day
and
the
next
and
most
part
of
the
following
night
so
that
by
the
morning
of
the
the

of

were
quite
overwhelmed
the
lanes
filled
so
as
to
be
impassable
and
the
ground
covered
twelve
or
fifteen
inches
without
any
drifting
in
the
evening
of
the
the
air
began
to
be
so
very
sharp
that
we
thought
it
would
be
curious
to
attend
to
the
motions
of
a
thermometer
we
therefore
hung
out
two
one
made
by
martin
and
one
by
dollond
which
soon
began
to
show
us
what
we
were
to
expect
for
by
ten
they
fell
to
and
at
eleven
to
when
we
went
to
bed
on
the
in
the
morning
the
quicksilver
of
dollond
glass
was
down
to
half
a
degree
below

that

which
was
absurdly
graduated
only
to
four
degrees
above
zero
sunk
quite
into
the

that
when
the

became

this
was
useless
on
the

eleven

though
the

was
perfectly
still
dollond
glass
went
down
to
one
degree
below

this
strange
severity
of
the
weather
made
me
very
desirous
to
know
what
degree
of
cold
there
might
be
in
such
an
exalted
and
near
situation
as
newton
we
had
therefore
on
the
morning
of
the
written
to
and
entreated
him
to
hang
out
his
thermometer
made
by
adams
and
to
pay
some
attention
to
it
morning
and
evening
expecting
wonderful
phaenomena
in
so
elevated
a
region
at
two
hundred
feet
or
more
above
my
house
but
behold
on
the
at
eleven
at
night
it
was
down
only
to
and
the
next
morning
at
when
mine
was
at
we
were
so
disturbed
at
this
unexpected
reverse
of
comparative
local
cold
that
we
sent
one
of
my
glasses
up
thinking
that
of
must
somehow
be
wrongly
constructed
but
when
the
instruments
came
to
be
confronted
they
went
exactly
together
so
that
for
one
night
at
least
the
cold
at
newton
was
degrees
less
than
at
selborne
and
through
the
whole
frost
or
degrees
and
indeed
when
we
came
to
observe
consequences
we
could
readily
credit
this
for
all
my
laurustines
bays
ilexes
arbutuses
cypresses
and
even
my
portugal
laurels
and
which
occasions
more
regret
my
fine
sloping
laurel

were
scorched
up

at

the

not
lost

miller
in
his
gardener

says
positively
that
the
portugal
laurels
remained
untouched

the
remarkable

of
so
that
either
that
accurate
observer
was
much
mistaken
or
else
the
frost
of
december
was
much
more
severe
and
destructive
than
that
in
the
year
above
mentioned
we
had
steady
frost
on
to
the
when
the
thermometer
in
the
morning
was
down
to
with
us

when
some
tendency
to
thaw
was
observed

thaw
was
confirmed

a
circumstance
that
i
must
not
omit
because
it
was
new
to
us
is
that
on
friday
december
the

the
air
was
full
of
icy
spiculae
floating
in
all
directions
like
atoms
in
a
let
into
a
dark
room
we
thought
them
at
first
particles
of
the
rime
falling
from
my
tall
hedges
but
were
soon
convinced
to
the
contrary
by
making
our
observations
in
open
places
where
no
rime
could
reach
us
were
they
watery
particles
of
the
air
frozen

they
floated

were
they

the
snow
frozen

they
mounted
we
were
much
obliged
to
the
thermometers
for
the
early
information
they
gave
us
and
hurried
our
apples
pears
onions
potatoes
into
the
cellar
and
warm
closets
while
those
who
had
not
or
neglected
such
warnings
lost
all
their
stores
of
roots
and
fruits
and
had
their
very
bread
and
cheese
frozen
i
must
not
omit
to
tell
you
that
during
those
two
siberian
days
my
was
so
electric
that
had
a
person
stroked
her
and
been
properly
insulated
the
shock
might
have
been
given
to
a
whole
circle
of
people
i
forgot
to
mention
before
that
during
the
two
severe
days
two
men
who
were
tracing
hares
in
the
snow
had
their
feet
frozen
and
two
men
who
were
much
better
employed
had
their
fingers
so
affected
by
the
frost
while
they
were
thrashing
in
a
barn
that
a
mortification
followed
from
which
they
did
not
recover
for
many
weeks
this
frost
killed
all
the
furze
and
most
of
the
ivy

in
many
places
stripped

a
very
early
time

have

letter

to

as
the
effects
of
heat
are
seldom
very
remarkable
in
the
northerly
climate
of
england
where
the
summers
are
often
so
defective
in
warmth
and
sunshine
as
not
to
ripen
the
fruits
of
the
earth
so
well
as
might
be
wished
i
shall
be
more
concise
in
my
account
of
the
severity
of
a
summer
season
and
so
make
a
little
amends
for
the
prolix
account
of
the
degrees
of
cold
and
the
inconveniences
that
we
suffered
from
late
rigorous
winters
the
summers
of
and
were
unusually
hot
and
dry
to
them

i
shall
turn
back
in
my
journals

recurring
to
any
more
distant

former

these
years
my
peach

suffered
so
much
from
the
heat
that
the
rind
on
the
bodies
was
scalded
and
came
off
since
which
the
trees
have
been
in
a
decaying
state
this
may
prove
a
hint
to
assiduous
gardeners
to
fence
and
shelter
their
with
mats
or
boards
as
they
may
easily
do
because
such
annoyance
is
seldom
of
long
continuance
during
that
summer
also
i
observed
that
my
apples
were
coddled
as
it
were
on
the
trees
so
that
they
had
no
quickness
of
flavour
and
would
not
keep
in
the
winter
this
circumstance
put
me
in
mind
of
what
i
have
heard
travellers
assert
that
they
never
ate
a
good
apple
or
apricot

south
of

where
the

were

great

destroy
all
the

as

the
occasion
of

seems
to
be
this
that
in
hot

the
effluvia
of
flowers
in
fields
and
meadows

drawn
up
in

have
hardly
ever
seen

that

a
most
extraordinary
appearance
unlike
anything
known
within
the
memory
of
man
by
my
journal

find
that
i
had
noticed
this
strange
occurrence
from
june
to
july
inclusive
during
which
period
the
wind
varied
to
every
quarter
without
making
any
alteration
in

the

looked
as
blank
as
a
clouded

and
shed
a
coloured
ferruginous
light
on
the
ground
and
floors
of
rooms
but
was
particularly
lurid
and
at
rising

time
the

was
so
intense
that
butchers
meat
could
hardly
be
eaten
on
the
day
after
it
was
killed

the

swarmed
so
in
the

that
they
rendered

frantic

to
look
with

for
the

applicable

it
alludes
to
a
superstitious
kind
of
dread
with
which

to

we
are
very
seldom
annoyed
with
and
it
is
no
less
remarkable
than
true
that
those
which
arise
in
the
south
have
hardly
been
known
to
reach
this
village
for
before
they
get
over
us
they
take
a
direction
to
the
east
or
to
the
west
or
sometimes
divide
into
two
and
go
in
part
to
one
of
those
quarters
and
in
part
to
the
other
as
was
truly
the
case
in
summer
when
though
the
country
round
was
continually
harassed
with
tempests
and
often
from
the
south
yet
we
escaped
them
all
as
appears
by
my
journal
of
that
summer
the
only
way
that
i
can
at
all
account
for
this
fact
for
such
it
is
is
that
on
that
quarter
between
us
and
the
sea
there
are
continual
mountains
hill
behind
hill
such
as
the
barnet
and
which
somehow
divert
the
storms
and
give
them
a
different
direction
high
promontories
and
elevated
grounds
have
always
been
observed
to
attract
clouds
and
disarm
them
of
their
mischievous
contents
which
are
discharged
into
the
trees
and
summits
as
soon
as
they
come
in
contact
with
those
turbulent
meteors
while
the
humble
vales
escape
because
they
are
so
far
beneath
them
but
when
i
say
i
do
not
remember
a
from
the
south
i
do
not
mean
that
we
never
have
suffered
from
at
all
for
on

the
thermometer
in
the
morning
being
at
and
at
noon
at
the
barometer
at
and
the

i
observed
a
blue
mist
smelling
strongly
of
sulphur
hanging
along
our
sloping
woods
and
seeming
to
indicate
that
thunder
was
at
hand
i
was
called
in
about
two
in
the
afternoon
and
so
missed
seeing
the
gathering
of
the
clouds
in
the
north
which
they
who
were
abroad
assured
me
had
something
uncommon
in
its
appearance
at
about
a
quarter
after
two
the
storm
began
in
the
parish
of
hartley
moving
slowly
from
north
to
south
and
from
thence
it
came
over
and
so
to
both
in
this
parish
it
began
with
vast
drops
of
rain
which
were
soon
succeeded
by
round
hail
and
then
by
convex
pieces
of
ice
which
measured
three
inches
in
girth
had
it
been
as
extensive
as
it
was
violent
and
of
any
continuance
for
it
was
very
short
it
must
have
ravaged
all
the
neighbourhood
in
the
parish
of
hartley
it
did
some
damage
to
one
farm
but
norton
which
lay
in
the
centre
of
the
storm
was
greatly
injured
as
was
grange
which
lay
next
to
it
it
did
but
just
reach
to
the
middle
of
the
village
where
the
hail
broke
my
north
windows
and
all
my
and
and
many
of
my
neighbours
windows
the
extent
of
the
storm
was
about
two
miles
in
length
and
one
in
breadth
we
were
just
sitting
down
to
dinner
but
were
soon
diverted
from
our
repast
by
the
clattering
of
tiles
and
the
jingling
of
glass
there
fell
at
the
same
time
prodigious
torrents
of
rain
on
the
farms
which
occasioned
a
flood
as
violent
as
it
was
sudden
doing
great
damage
to
the
meadows
and
fallows
by
deluging
the
one
and
washing
away
the
soil
of
the
other
the
hollow
lane
towards
alton
was
so
torn
and
disordered
as
not
to
be
passable
till
mended
rocks
being
removed
that
weighed
weight
those
that
saw
the
effect
which
the
great
hail
had
on
ponds
and
pools
say
that
the
dashing
of
the
water
made
an
extraordinary
appearance
the
froth
and
spray
standing
up
in
the
air
three
feet
above
the
surface
the
rushing
and
roaring
of
the
hail
as
it
approached
was
truly
tremendous
though
the
clouds
at
south
lambeth
near
london
were
at
that
juncture
thin
and
light
and
no
storm
was
in
sight
nor
within
hearing
yet
the
air
was
strongly
electric
for
the
bells
of
an
electric
machine
at
that
place
rang
repeatedly
and
fierce
sparks
were
discharged
when
i
first
took
the
present
work
in
hand
i
proposed
to
have
added
an
annus
or
the
natural
history
of
the
twelve
months
of
the
year
which
would
have
comprised
many
incidents
and
occurrences
that
have
not
fallen
in
my
way
to
be
mentioned
in
my
series
of
letters
but
as
aikin
of
warrington
has
lately
published
somewhat
of
this
sort
and
as
the
length
of
my
correspondence
has
sufficiently
put
your
patience
to
the
test
i
shall
here
take
a
respectful
leave
of
you
and
natural
history
together
and
am
with
all
due
deference
and
regard
your
most
obliged
and
most
humble
servant
