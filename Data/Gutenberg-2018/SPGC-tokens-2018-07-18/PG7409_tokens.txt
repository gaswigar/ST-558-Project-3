an
essay
on
criticism
by
alexander
pope
introductory
and
explanatory
alexander
pope
this
eminent
english
poet
was
born
in
london
may
his
parents
were
roman
catholics
and
to
this
faith
the
poet
adhered
thus
debarring
himself
from
public
office
and
employment
his
father
a
linen
merchant
having
saved
a
moderate
competency
withdrew
from
business
and
settled
on
a
small
estate
he
had
purchased
in
windsor
forest
he
died
at
chiswick
in
his
son
shortly
afterwards
took
a
long
lease
of
a
house
and
five
acres
of
land
at
twickenham
on
the
banks
of
the
thames
whither
he
retired
with
his
widowed
mother
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
and
where
he
resided
till
death
cultivating
his
little
domain
with
exquisite
taste
and
skill
and
embellishing
it
with
a
grotto
temple
wilderness
and
other
adjuncts
poetical
and
picturesque
in
this
famous
villa
pope
was
visited
by
the
most
celebrated
wits
statesmen
and
beauties
of
the
day
himself
being
the
most
popular
and
successful
poet
of
his
age
his
early
years
were
spent
at
binfield
within
the
range
of
the
royal
forest
he
received
some
education
at
little
catholic
schools
but
was
his
own
instructor
after
his
twelfth
year
he
never
was
a
profound
or
accurate
scholar
but
he
read
latin
poets
with
ease
and
delight
and
acquired
some
greek
french
and
italian
he
was
a
poet
almost
from
infancy
he
lisped
in
numbers
and
when
a
mere
youth
surpassed
all
his
contemporaries
in
metrical
harmony
and
correctness
his
pastorals
and
some
translations
appeared
in
but
were
written
three
or
four
years
earlier
these
were
followed
by
the
on
of
the
when
completed
the
most
graceful
airy
and
imaginative
of
his
works
of
in
a
collection
of
his
works
printed
in
he
included
the
of
and
on
an
unfortunate
two
poems
inimitable
for
pathetic
beauty
and
finished
melodious
versification
from
till
pope
was
chiefly
engaged
on
his
translations
of
the
and
which
though
wanting
in
time
homeric
simplicity
naturalness
and
grandeur
are
splendid
poems
in
he
published
his
greatest
satire
the
an
attack
on
all
poetasters
and
pretended
wits
and
on
all
other
persons
against
whom
the
sensitive
poet
had
conceived
any
enmity
in
he
gave
to
the
world
a
volume
of
his
containing
some
pleasant
gossip
and
observations
with
choice
passages
of
description
but
it
appears
that
the
correspondence
was
manufactured
for
publication
not
composed
of
actual
letters
addressed
to
the
parties
whose
names
are
given
and
the
collection
was
introduced
to
the
public
by
means
of
an
elaborate
stratagem
on
the
part
of
the
scheming
poet
between
the
years
and
he
issued
a
series
of
poetical
essays
moral
and
philosophical
with
satires
and
imitations
of
horace
all
admirable
for
sense
wit
spirit
and
brilliancy
of
these
delightful
productions
the
most
celebrated
is
the
on
to
which
bolingbroke
is
believed
to
have
contributed
the
spurious
philosophy
and
false
sentiment
but
its
merit
consists
in
detached
passages
descriptions
and
pictures
a
fourth
book
to
the
containing
many
beautiful
and
striking
lines
and
a
general
revision
of
his
works
closed
the
poet
literary
cares
and
toils
he
died
on
the
of
may
and
was
buried
in
the
church
at
twickenham
pope
was
of
very
diminutive
stature
and
deformed
from
his
birth
his
physical
infirmity
susceptible
temperament
and
incessant
study
rendered
his
life
one
long
disease
he
was
as
his
friend
lord
chesterfield
said
the
most
irritable
of
all
the
irritabile
offended
with
trifles
and
never
forgetting
or
forgiving
them
his
literary
stratagems
disguises
assertions
denials
and
we
must
add
misrepresentations
would
fill
volumes
yet
when
no
disturbing
jealousy
vanity
or
rivalry
intervened
was
generous
and
affectionate
and
he
had
a
manly
independent
spirit
as
a
poet
he
was
deficient
in
originality
and
creative
power
and
thus
was
inferior
to
his
prototype
dryden
but
as
a
literary
artist
and
brilliant
declaimer
satirist
and
moralizer
in
verse
he
is
still
unrivaled
he
is
the
english
horace
and
will
as
surely
descend
with
honors
to
the
latest
posterity
an
essay
on
criticism
written
in
the
year
the
title
essay
on
hardly
indicates
all
that
is
included
in
the
poem
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
give
a
full
and
exact
idea
of
the
art
of
poetical
criticism
without
entering
into
the
consideration
of
the
art
of
poetry
accordingly
pope
has
interwoven
the
precepts
of
both
throughout
the
poem
which
might
more
properly
have
been
styled
an
essay
on
the
art
of
criticism
and
of
poetry
part
i
is
hard
to
say
if
greater
want
of
skill
appear
in
writing
or
in
judging
ill
but
of
the
two
less
dangerous
is
the
offense
to
tire
our
patience
than
mislead
our
sense
some
few
in
that
but
numbers
err
in
this
ten
censure
wrong
for
one
who
writes
amiss
a
fool
might
once
himself
alone
expose
now
one
in
verse
makes
many
more
in
prose
is
with
our
judgments
as
our
watches
none
go
just
alike
yet
each
believes
his
own
in
poets
as
true
genius
is
but
rare
true
taste
as
seldom
is
the
critic
share
both
must
alike
from
heaven
derive
their
light
these
born
to
judge
as
well
as
those
to
write
let
such
teach
others
who
themselves
excel
and
censure
freely
who
have
written
well
authors
are
partial
to
their
wit
is
true
but
are
not
critics
to
their
judgment
too
yet
if
we
look
more
closely
we
shall
find
most
have
the
seeds
of
judgment
in
their
mind
nature
affords
at
least
a
glimmering
light
the
lines
though
touched
but
faintly
are
drawn
right
but
as
the
slightest
sketch
if
justly
traced
is
by
ill
coloring
but
the
more
disgraced
so
by
false
learning
is
good
sense
defaced
some
are
bewildered
in
the
maze
of
schools
and
some
made
coxcombs
nature
meant
but
fools
in
search
of
wit
these
lose
their
common
sense
and
then
turn
critics
in
their
own
defense
each
burns
alike
who
can
or
can
not
write
or
with
a
rival
or
an
eunuch
spite
all
fools
have
still
an
itching
to
deride
and
fain
would
be
upon
the
laughing
side
if
maevius
scribble
in
apollo
spite
there
are
who
judge
still
worse
than
he
can
write
some
have
at
first
for
wits
then
poets
passed
turned
critics
next
and
proved
plain
fools
at
last
some
neither
can
for
wits
nor
critics
pass
as
heavy
mules
are
neither
horse
nor
ass
those
witlings
numerous
in
our
isle
as
insects
on
the
banks
of
nile
unfinished
things
one
knows
not
what
to
call
their
generation
is
so
equivocal
to
tell
them
would
a
hundred
tongues
require
or
one
vain
wits
that
might
a
hundred
tire
but
you
who
seek
to
give
and
merit
fame
and
justly
bear
a
critic
noble
name
be
sure
yourself
and
your
own
reach
to
know
how
far
your
genius
taste
and
learning
go
launch
not
beyond
your
depth
but
be
discreet
and
mark
that
point
where
sense
and
dullness
meet
nature
to
all
things
fixed
the
limits
fit
and
wisely
curbed
proud
man
pretending
wit
as
on
the
land
while
here
the
ocean
gains
in
other
parts
it
leaves
wide
sandy
plains
thus
in
the
soul
while
memory
prevails
the
solid
power
of
understanding
fails
where
beams
of
warm
imagination
play
the
memory
soft
figures
melt
away
one
science
only
will
one
genius
fit
so
vast
is
art
so
narrow
human
wit
not
only
bounded
to
peculiar
arts
but
oft
in
those
confined
to
single
parts
like
kings
we
lose
the
conquests
gained
before
by
vain
ambition
still
to
make
them
more
each
might
his
several
province
well
command
would
all
but
stoop
to
what
they
understand
first
follow
nature
and
your
judgment
frame
by
her
just
standard
which
is
still
the
same
unerring
nature
still
divinely
bright
one
clear
unchanged
and
universal
light
life
force
and
beauty
must
to
all
impart
at
once
the
source
and
end
and
test
of
art
art
from
that
fund
each
just
supply
provides
works
without
show
and
without
pomp
presides
in
some
fair
body
thus
the
informing
soul
with
spirits
feeds
with
vigor
fills
the
whole
each
motion
guides
and
every
nerve
sustains
itself
unseen
but
in
the
effects
remains
some
to
whom
heaven
in
wit
has
been
profuse
want
as
much
more
to
turn
it
to
its
use
for
wit
and
judgment
often
are
at
strife
though
meant
each
other
aid
like
man
and
wife
is
more
to
guide
than
spur
the
muse
steed
restrain
his
fury
than
provoke
his
speed
the
winged
courser
like
a
generous
horse
shows
most
true
mettle
when
you
check
his
course
those
rules
of
old
discovered
not
devised
are
nature
still
but
nature
methodized
nature
like
liberty
is
but
restrained
by
the
same
laws
which
first
herself
ordained
hear
how
learned
greece
her
useful
rules
indites
when
to
repress
and
when
indulge
our
flights
high
on
parnassus
top
her
sons
she
showed
and
pointed
out
those
arduous
paths
they
trod
held
from
afar
aloft
the
immortal
prize
and
urged
the
rest
by
equal
steps
to
rise
just
precepts
thus
from
great
examples
given
she
drew
from
them
what
they
derived
from
heaven
the
generous
critic
fanned
the
poet
fire
and
taught
the
world
with
reason
to
admire
then
criticism
the
muse
handmaid
proved
to
dress
her
charms
and
make
her
more
beloved
but
following
wits
from
that
intention
strayed
who
could
not
win
the
mistress
wooed
the
maid
against
the
poets
their
own
arms
they
turned
sure
to
hate
most
the
men
from
whom
they
learned
so
modern
pothecaries
taught
the
art
by
doctors
bills
to
play
the
doctor
part
bold
in
the
practice
of

and
call

ancient
authors
prey
nor
time
nor
moths
spoil
so
much
as
they
some
dryly
plain
without
invention
aid
write
dull
receipts
how
poems
may
be
made
these
leave
the
sense
their
learning
to
display
and
those
explain
the
meaning
quite
away
you
then
whose
judgment
the
right
course
would
steer
know
well
each
ancient
proper
character
his
fable
subject
scope
in
every
page
religion
country
genius
of
his
age
without
all
these
at
once
before
your
eyes
cavil
you
may
but
never
criticise
be
homers
works
your
study
and
delight
read
them
by
day
and
meditate
by
night
thence
form
your
judgment
thence
your
maxims
bring
and
trace
the
muses
upward
to
their
spring
still
with
itself
compared
his
text
peruse
and
let
your
comment
be
the
mantuan
muse
when
first
young
maro
in
his
boundless
mind
a
work
to
outlast
immortal
rome
designed
perhaps
he
seemed
above
the
critic
law
and
but
from
nature
fountain
scorned
to
draw
but
when
to
examine
every
part
he
came
nature
and
homer
were
he
found
the
same
convinced
amazed
he
checks
the
bold
design
and
rules
as
strict
his
labored
work
confine
as
if
the
stagirite
each
line
learn
hence
for
ancient
rules
a
just
esteem
to
copy
nature
is
to
copy
them
some
beauties
yet
no
precepts
can
declare
for
there
a
happiness
as
well
as
care
music
resembles
poetry
in
each
are
nameless
graces
which
no
methods
teach
and
which
a
master
hand
alone
can
reach
if
where
the
rules
not
far
enough
extend
since
rules
were
made
but
to
promote
their
end
some
lucky
license
answer
to
the
full
the
intent
proposed
that
license
is
a
rule
thus
pegasus
a
nearer
way
to
take
may
boldly
deviate
from
the
common
track
great
wits
sometimes
may
gloriously
offend
and
rise
to
faults
true
critics
dare
not
mend
from
vulgar
bounds
with
brave
disorder
part
and
snatch
a
grace
beyond
the
reach
of
art
which
without
passing
through
the
judgment
gains
the
heart
and
all
its
end
at
once
attains
in
prospects
thus
some
objects
please
our
eyes
which
out
of
nature
common
order
rise
the
shapeless
rock
or
hanging
precipice
but
though
the
ancients
thus
their
rules
invade
as
kings
dispense
with
laws
themselves
have
made
moderns
beware
or
if
you
must
offend
against
the
precept
transgress
its
end
let
it
be
seldom
and
compelled
by
need
and
have
at
least
their
precedent
to
plead
the
critic
else
proceeds
without
remorse
seizes
your
fame
and
puts
his
laws
in
force
i
know
there
are
to
whose
presumptuous
thoughts
those
freer
beauties
even
in
them
seem
faults
some
figures
monstrous
and
misshaped
appear
considered
singly
or
beheld
too
near
which
but
proportioned
to
their
light
or
place
due
distance
reconciles
to
form
and
grace
a
prudent
chief
not
always
must
display
his
powers
in
equal
ranks
and
fair
array
but
with
the
occasion
and
the
place
comply
conceal
his
force
nay
seem
sometimes
to
fly
those
oft
are
stratagems
which
errors
seem
nor
is
it
homer
nods
but
we
that
dream
still
green
with
bays
each
ancient
altar
stands
above
the
reach
of
sacrilegious
hands
secure
from
flames
from
envy
fiercer
rage
destructive
war
and
age
see
from
each
clime
the
learned
their
incense
bring
hear
in
all
tongues
consenting
paeans
ring
in
praise
so
just
let
every
voice
be
joined
and
fill
the
general
chorus
of
mankind
hail
bards
triumphant
born
in
happier
days
immortal
heirs
of
universal
praise
whose
honors
with
increase
of
ages
grow
as
streams
roll
down
enlarging
as
they
flow
nations
unborn
your
mighty
names
shall
sound
and
worlds
applaud
that
must
not
yet
be
found
oh
may
some
spark
of
your
celestial
fire
the
last
the
meanest
of
your
sons
inspire
that
on
weak
wings
from
far
pursues
your
flights
glows
while
he
reads
but
trembles
as
he
writes
to
teach
vain
wits
a
science
little
known

admire

and
doubt
their
own
part
ii
of
all
the
causes
which
conspire
to
blind
man
erring
judgment
and
misguide
the
mind
what
the

is
pride
the
vice
of
fools
whatever
nature
has
in
worth
denied
she
gives
in
large
recruits
of
needful
pride
for
as
in

thus
in
souls
we
find
what
wants
in
blood
and
spirits
swelled
with
wind
pride
where
wit
fails
steps
in
to
our
defense
and
fills
up
all
the
mighty
void
of
sense
if

right

drives

upon
us
with

trust

a
little

is
a
dangerous
thing
drink
deep
or
taste
not
the
pierian
spring
there
shallow
draughts
intoxicate
the
brain
and
drinking
largely
sobers
us
again
fired
at
first
sight
with
what
the
muse
imparts
in
fearless
youth
we
tempt
the
heights
of
arts
while
from
the
bounded
level
of
our
mind
short
views
we
take
nor
see
the
lengths
behind
but
more
advanced
behold
with
strange
surprise
new
distant
scenes
of
endless
science
rise
so
pleased
at
first
the
towering
alps
we
try
mount
the
vales
and
seem
to
tread
the
sky
the
eternal
snows
appear
already
passed
and
the
first
clouds
and
mountains
seem
the
last
but
those
attained
we
tremble
to
survey
the
growing
labors
of
the
lengthened
way
the
increasing
prospect
tires
our
wandering
eyes
hills
peep
hills
and
alps
on
alps
arise
a
perfect
judge
will
read
each
work
of
wit
with
the
same
spirit
that
its
author
writ
survey
the
whole
nor
seek
slight
faults
to
find
where
nature
moves
and
rapture
warms
the
mind
nor
lose
for
that
malignant
dull
delight
the
generous
pleasure
to
be
charmed
with
wit
but
in
such
lays
as
neither
ebb
nor
flow
correctly
cold
and
regularly
low
that
shunning
faults
one
quiet
tenor
keep
we
can
not
blame
indeed
but
we
may
sleep
in
wit
as
nature
what
affects
our
hearts
is
not
the
exactness
of
peculiar
parts
is
not
a
lip
or
eye
we
beauty
call
but
the
joint
force
and
full
result
of
all
thus
when
we
view
some
well
proportioned
dome
the
worlds
just
wonder
and
even
thine
o
rome
no
single
parts
unequally
surprise
all
comes
united
to
the
admiring
eyes
no
monstrous
height
or
breadth
or
length
appear
the
whole
at
once
is
bold
and
regular
whoever
thinks
a
faultless

we

modest

sets
off
sprightly
wit
for

may
have

through

books

their

still
the

the

they

take
upon

words
are
like

and
where
they
most
abound
much
fruit
of

beneath
is
rarely
found
false
eloquence
like
the

the

we
no

without

it

none
expression
is
the

still

a

conceit
in

in

mere
moderns
in

such
labored
nothings
in
so
strange
a

amaze
the
unlearned
and
make
the

smile
unlucky
as
fungoso
in
the

these
sparks
with
awkward
vanity
display
what
the
fine

wore

so
mimic
ancient
wits
at
best
as
apes
our
grandsires
in

doublets
dressed
in

as

the

will
hold
alike
fantastic

old
be
not
the
first
by
whom
the
new
are
tried
nor
yet
the
last
to
lay

aside
but
most
by
numbers
judge
a
poet
song
and
smooth
or
rough
with
them
is
right
or
wrong
in
the
bright
muse
though
thousand
charms
conspire
her
voice
is
all
these
tuneful
fools
admire
who
haunt
parnassus
but
to
please
their
ear
not
mend
their
minds
as
some
to
church
repair
not
for
the
doctrine
but
the
music
there
these
equal
syllables
alone
require
though
oft
the
ear
the
open
vowels
tire
while
expletives
their
feeble
aid
do
join
and
ten
low
words
oft
creep
in
one
dull
line
while
they
ring
round
the
same
unvaried
chimes
with
sure
returns
of
still
expected
rhymes
you
find
the
cooling
western
breeze
in
the
next
line
it
whispers
through
the
trees
if
crystal
streams
with
pleasing
murmurs
creep
the
reader
threatened
not
in
vain
with
sleep
then
at
the
last
and
only
couplet
fraught
with
some
unmeaning
thing
they
call
a
thought
a
needless
alexandrine
ends
the
song
that
like
a
wounded
snake
drags
its
slow
length
along
leave
such
to
tune
their
own
dull
rhymes
and
know
what
roundly
smooth
or
languishingly
slow
and
praise
the
easy
vigor
of
a
line
where
denham
strength
and
waller
sweetness
join
true
ease
in
writing
comes
from
art
not
chance
as
those
move
easiest
who
have
learned
to
dance
is
not
enough
no
harshness
gives
offense
the
sound
must
seem
an
echo
to
the
sense
soft
is
the
strain
when
zephyr
gently
blows
and
the
smooth
stream
in
smoother
numbers
flows
but
when
loud
surges
lash
the
sounding
shore
the
hoarse
rough
verse
should
like
the
torrent
roar
when
ajax
strives
some
rock
vast
weight
to
throw
the
line
too
labors
and
the
words
move
slow
not
so
when
swift
camilla
scours
the

flies
the
unbending
corn
and
skims
along
the
main
hear
how
timotheus
varied
lays
surprise
and
bid
alternate
passions
fall
and
rise
while
at
each
change
the
son
of
libyan
jove
now
burns
with
glory
and
then
melts
with
love
now
his
fierce
eyes
with
sparkling
fury
glow
now
sighs
steal
out
and
tears
begin
to
flow
persians
and
greeks
like
turns
of
nature
found
and
the
world
victor
stood
subdued
by
sound
the
power
of
music
all
our
hearts
allow
and
what
timotheus
was
is
dryden
now
avoid
extremes
and
shun
the
fault
of
such
who
still
are
pleased
too
little
or
too
much
at
every
trifle
scorn
to
take
offense
that
always
shows
great
pride
or
little
sense
those
heads
as
stomachs
are
not
sure
the
best
which
nauseate
all
and
nothing
can
digest
yet
let
not
each
gay
turn
thy
rapture
move
for
fools
admire
but
men
of
sense
approve
as
things
seem
large
which
we
through
mist
descry
dullness
is
ever
apt
to
magnify
some
foreign
writers
some
our
own
despise
the
ancients
only
or
the
moderns
prize
thus
wit
like
faith
by
each
man
is
applied
to
one
small
sect
and
all
are
damned
beside
meanly
they
seek
the
blessing
to
confine
and
force
that
sun
but
on
a
part
to
shine
which
not
alone
the
southern
wit
sublimes
but
ripens
spirits
in
cold
northern
climes
which
from
the
first
has
shone
on
ages
past
enlights
the
present
and
shall
warm
the
last
though
each
may
feel
increases
and
decays
and
see
now
clearer
and
now
darker
days
regard
not
then
if
wit
be
old
or
new
but
blame
the
false
and
value
still
the
true
some
advance
a
judgment
of
their
own
but
catch
the
spreading
notion
of
the
town
they
reason
and
conclude
by
precedent
and
own
stale
nonsense
which
they
invent
some
judge
of
authors
names
not
works
and
then
nor
praise
nor
blame
the
writing
but
the
men
of
all
this
servile
herd
the
worst
is
he
that
in
proud
dullness
joins
with
quality
a
constant
critic
at
the
great
man
board
to
fetch
and
carry
nonsense
for
my
lord
what
woful
stuff
this
madrigal
would
be
in
some
starved
hackney
sonnetteer
or
me
but
let
a
lord
once
own
the
happy
lines
how
the
wit
brightens
how
the
style
refines
before
his
sacred
name
flies
every
fault
and
each
exalted
stanza
teems
with
thought
the
vulgar
thus
through
imitation
err
as
oft
the
learned
by
being
singular
so
much
they
scorn
the
crowd
that
if
the
throng
by
chance
go
right
they
purposely
go
wrong
so
schismatics
the
plain
believers
quit
and
are
but
damned
for
having
too
much
wit
some
praise
at
morning
what
they
blame
at
night
but
always
think
the
last
opinion
right
a
muse
by
these
is
like
a
mistress
used
this
hour
she
idolized
the
next
abused
while
their
weak
heads
like
towns
unfortified
sense
and
nonsense
daily
change
their
side
ask
them
the
cause
they
wiser
still
they
say
and
still
wiser
than
we
think
our
fathers
fools
so
wise
we
grow
our
wiser
sons
no
doubt
will
think
us
so
once
this
zealous
isle
who
knew
most
sentences
was
deepest
read
faith
gospel
all
seemed
made
to
be
disputed
and
none
had
sense
enough
to
be
confuted
scotists
and
thomists
now
in
peace
remain
amidst
their
kindred
cobwebs
in
duck
lane
if
faith
itself
has
different
dresses
worn
what
wonder
modes
in
wit
should
take
their
turn
oft
leaving
what
is
natural
and
fit
the
current
folly
proves
the
ready
wit
and
authors
think
their
reputation
safe
which
lives
as
long
as
fools
are
pleased
to
laugh
some
valuing

of
their

still
make
themselves
the

merit

like

the

true
for

like

the

grossness
not

is
but
just
to
let
them
live
betimes
no
longer
now
that
golden
age
appears
when
patriarch
wits
survived
a
thousand
years
now
length
of
fame
our
second

is
lost
and
bare
threescore
is
all
even

failing

and
such
as
chaucer
is
shall
dryden
be
so
when
the
faithful
pencil
has
designed
some
bright
idea
of
the
master
mind
where
a
new
world
leaps
out
at
his
command
and
ready
nature
waits
upon
his
hand
when
the
ripe
colors
soften
and
unite
and
sweetly
melt
into
just
shade
and
light
when
mellowing
years
their
full
perfection
give
and
each
bold
figure
just
begins
to
live
the
treacherous
colors
the
fair
art
betray
and
all
the
bright
creation
fades
away
unhappy
wit
like
most
mistaken
things
atones
not
for
that
envy
which
it
brings
in
youth
alone
its
empty
praise
we
boast
but
soon
the
short
lived
vanity
is
lost
like
some
fair
flower
the
early
spring
supplies
that
gayly
blooms
but
even
in
blooming
dies
what
is
this
wit
which
must
our
cares
employ
the
owner

that

then
most
our
trouble
still
when

still
the

we
give
the
more
required
whose
fame
with
pains
we
guard
but
lose
with

sure
some
to
vex
but
never
all
to
please
is
what
the
vicious
fear
the
virtuous
shun
by

is
hated
and
by
knaves
undone
if

its
foe
of
