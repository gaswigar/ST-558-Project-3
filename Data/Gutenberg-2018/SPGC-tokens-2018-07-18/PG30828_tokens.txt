was
repeating
itself
there
were
moats
and
nobles
in
pennsylvania
and
vassals
in
manhattan
and
the
barbarian
hordes
were
overrunning
the
the
barbarians
by
john
sentry
it
was
just
as
he
saw
the
barbarian
squat
black
tankette
lurch
hurriedly
into
a
nest
of
boulders
that
young
giulion
geoffrey
realized
he
had
been
betrayed
with
the
muzzle
of
his
own
cannon
still
hot
from
the
shell
that
had
jammed
the
barbarian
turret
he
had
yanked
the
starboard
track
lever
to
wheel
into
position
for
the
finishing
shot
all
around
him
the
remnants
of
the
barbarian
invading
army
were
being
cut
to
flaming
ribbons
by
the
armored
vehicles
of
the
seaboard
league
the
night
was
shot
through
by
billows
of
cannon
fire
and
the
din
of
laboring
engines
guns
and
rent
metal
was
a
cacophonic
climax
to
the
seaboard
league
first
decisive
victory
over
the
inland
invaders
young
geoffrey
could
justifiably
feel
that
he
would
cap
that
climax
by
personally
accounting
for
the
greatest
of
the
inland
barbarians
the
barbarian
general
himself
he
trained
his
sights
on
the
scarlet
bearpaw
painted
on
the
skewed
turret
flank
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
firing
lever
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
another
tankette
rushing
up
on
his
port
side
he
glanced
at
it
saw
its
graceful
handcrafting
and
knew
it
for
one
of
the
league
own
he
could
even
see
the
insigne
the
mailed
heel
trampling
a
stand
of
wheat
harolde
dugald
of
the
neighboring
fief
geoffrey
was
on
coldly
polite
terms
with
dugald
he
had
no
use
for
the
other
man
way
of
treating
his
serfs
and
now
he
felt
a
prickle
of
indignant
rage
at
this
attempt
to
usurp
a
share
of
his
glory
he
saw
dugald
turret
begin
to
traverse
and
hastily
tried
to
get
the
finishing
shot
into
the
barbarian
tankette
before
the
other
leaguesman
could
fire
but
dugald
was
not
aiming
for
the
barbarian
first
he
had
to
eliminate
geoffrey
from
the
scene
entirely
when
he
fired
at
almost
range
the
world
seemed
to
explode
in
giulion
eyes
illustration
by
ed
somehow
no
whistling
shard
of
metal
actually
hit
him
but
the
tankette
sturdy
as
it
was
could
not
hope
to
protect
him
entirely
he
was
thrown
viciously
into
the
air
his
ribs
first
smashing
into
the
side
of
the
hatch
and
then
he
was
thrown
clear
onto
the
rocky
ground
of
the
foothills
agonized
stunned
to
he
lay
feebly
beating
at
his
smoldering
tunic
while
dugald
spun
viciously
by
him
almost
crushing
him
under
one
tread
he
saw
dugald
tankette
plunge
into
the
rocks
after
the
barbarian
and
then
suddenly
the
battle
was
beyond
him
dugald
the
barbarian
all
the
thundering
might
that
had
clashed
here
on
the
eastern
seaboard
of
what
had
long
ago
been
the
united
states
of
america
all
of
this
had
suddenly
as
battles
will
whirled
off
in
a
new
direction
and
left
giulion
geoffrey
to
lie
hurt
and
unconscious
in
the
night
he
awoke
to
the
trickle
of
cold
water
between
his
teeth
his
lips
bit
into
the
threaded
metal
of
a
canteen
top
and
a
huge
arm
supported
his
shoulders
broad
shoulders
and
a
massive
head
loomed
over
him
against
the
stars
a
rumbling
gentle
voice
said
all
right
lad
now
swallow
some
before
it
all
wasted
he
peered
around
him
in
the
night
it
was
as
still
as
the
bottom
of
a
grave
nothing
moved
he
drew
a
ragged
breath
that
ended
in
a
sharp
gasp
and
the
rumbling
voice
said
ribs
he
nodded
and
managed
a
strangled
yes
should
wonder
the
stranger
grunted
i
saw
you
pop
out
of
your
tank
like
a
cork
coming
out
of
a
wine
bottle
that
was
a
fair
shot
he
hit
you
you
lucky
a
broad
hand
pressed
him
down
as
the
memory
of
dugald
treachery
started
him
struggling
to
his
feet
hold
still
lad
we
give
you
a
chance
to
catch
your
breath
and
wrap
some
bandages
around
you
you
live
to
give
him
his
due
but
not
tonight
have
to
wait
for
another
day
there
was
something
in
the
stranger
voice
that
geoffrey
recognized
for
the
quality
that
made
men
obey
other
men
it
was
competence
and
even
more
the
calm
expression
of
good
sense
tonight
geoffrey
needed
someone
with
that
quality
he
sank
back
grateful
for
the
stranger
help
i
giulion
geoffrey
of
geoffrion
he
said
and
indebted
to
you
who
are
you
stranger
the
darkness
rumbled
to
a
deep
rueful
laugh
in
these
parts
lad
not
called
by
my
proper
name
i
hodd
savage
the
barbarian
and
that
was
a
fair
knock
gave
young
geoffrey
silence
lasted
for
a
long
while
then
he
said
in
a
flat
distant
voice
why
did
you
give
me
water
if
you
going
to
kill
me
anyway
the
barbarian
laughed
again
this
time
in
pure
amusement
because
not
going
to
kill
you
obviously
you
too
good
a
cannoneer
to
be
despatched
by
a
belt
knife
no
no
lad
i
not
planning
to
kill
anyone
for
some
time
all
i
want
right
now
is
to
get
out
of
here
and
get
home
i
got
another
army
to
raise
to
make
up
for
this
pasting
you
leaguesmen
have
just
given
me
next
time
you
wo
be
so
lucky
geoffrey
muttered
we
see
your
hide
flapping
in
the
rain
if
you
ever
foolish
enough
to
raid
our
lands
again
the
barbarian
slapped
his
thigh
by
god
he
chuckled
i
knew
it
was
some
ordinary
princeling
that
outmaneuvered
he
shook
his
head
that
other
pup
had
better
watch
out
for
you
if
you
ever
cross
his
path
again
i
lost
him
in
the
rocks
with
ease
to
spare
bad
luck
your
shot
smashed
my
fuel
tanks
or
i
be
halfway
home
by
now
the
rolling
voice
grew
low
and
bitter
no
sense
waiting
to
pick
up
my
men
not
enough
of
left
to
make
a
corporal
guard
what
do
you
mean
i
ever
cross
dugald
path
again
i
have
him
called
out
to
trial
by
combat
the
day
i
can
ride
a
tankette
once
more
i
would
be
too
sure
lad
the
barbarian
said
gently
what
does
that
look
like
over
there
geoffrey
turned
his
head
to
follow
the
shadowy
pointing
arm
and
saw
a
flicker
of
light
in
the
distance
he
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
a
huge
campfire
with
the
leaguesmen
tankettes
drawn
up
around
it
they
dividing
the
spoils
what
prisoners
there
are
to
work
the
mills
whatever
of
your
equipment
is
still
usable
your
baggage
train
and
so
forth
what
of
it
ah
yes
my
baggage
train
the
barbarian
muttered
well
we
come
back
to
that
what
else
do
you
suppose
they
dividing
geoffrey
frowned
why
nothing
else
wait
he
sat
up
sharply
ignoring
his
ribs
the
fiefs
of
the
dead
nobles
exactly
your
ramshackle
little
league
held
together
long
enough
to
whip
us
for
the
first
time
but
now
the
princelings
are
dividing
up
and
returning
to
their
separate
holdings
once
there
they
go
back
to
peering
covetously
at
each
other
lands
and
maybe
raid
amongst
themselves
a
little
until
i
come
back
again
and
you
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
at
this
moment
lad
no
fief
no
lands
no
title
unless
there
an
heir
geoffrey
shook
his
head
distractedly
no
i
not
wed
it
as
you
say
and
just
try
to
get
your
property
back
no
no
it
wo
be
so
easy
to
return
unless
you
care
to
be
a
serf
on
your
own
former
holding
dugald
would
have
me
killed
geoffrey
said
bitterly
so
there
you
are
lad
the
only
advantage
you
have
is
that
dugald
thinks
you
dead
already
you
can
be
sure
of
that
or
it
would
have
been
an
assassin
and
not
me
that
woke
you
that
something
at
least
it
a
beginning
but
you
have
to
lay
your
plans
carefully
and
take
your
time
i
certainly
would
plan
on
doing
anything
until
your
healed
and
your
brain
had
time
to
work
young
geoffrey
blinked
back
the
tears
of
rage
the
thought
of
losing
the
town
and
lands
his
father
had
left
him
was
almost
more
than
his
hot
blood
could
stand
the
memory
of
the
great
old
keep
that
dominated
the
town
with
its
tapestried
halls
and
torchlit
chambers
was
suddenly
very
precious
to
him
he
felt
a
sharp
pang
at
the
thought
that
he
must
sleep
in
a
field
tonight
like
some
skulking
outlaw
while
dugald
quite
possibly
got
himself
drunk
on
geoffrion
wine
and
snored
his
headache
away
on
the
thick
furs
of
geoffrey
bed
but
the
barbarian
was
right
time
was
needed
and
this
meant
that
to
a
certain
extent
at
least
his
lot
and
savage
were
thrown
in
together
the
thought
came
to
geoffrey
that
he
might
have
chosen
a
worse
partner
now
lad
the
barbarian
said
as
long
as
you
not
doing
anything
else
you
might
as
well
help
me
with
my
problem
the
realization
of
just
exactly
who
this
man
was
came
sharply
back
to
young
geoffrey
i
wo
help
you
escape
to
your
own
lands
if
what
you
mean
he
said
quickly
i
take
good
care
of
that
myself
when
the
time
comes
the
man
answered
drily
right
now
i
got
something
else
in
mind
dividing
my
baggage
train
as
you
said
now
i
do
mind
that
seeing
as
most
of
it
belonged
to
them
in
the
first
place
i
do
mind
it
for
this
year
that
is
but
there
something
else
one
of
you
cockerels
will
be
wanting
to
take
home
with
him
and
i
a
mind
not
to
let
him
there
a
perfectly
good
woman
in
my
personal
trailer
and
i
going
to
get
her
but
if
we
going
to
do
that
and
get
clear
of
this
country
by
morning
we
better
get
to
it
like
every
other
young
man
of
his
time
and
place
geoffrey
had
a
sense
of
duty
regarding
the
safety
and
of
ladies
he
had
an
entirely
different
set
of
attitudes
toward
women
who
were
not
ladies
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
which
to
apply
to
this
case
what
sort
of
woman
would
the
barbarian
take
to
battle
with
him
what
sort
of
women
would
the
inland
barbarians
have
generally
he
had
very
little
knowledge
to
go
on
the
inlanders
had
been
appearing
from
over
the
westward
mountains
for
generations
looting
and
pillaging
almost
at
will
sometimes
staying
through
a
winter
but
usually
disappearing
in
the
early
fall
carrying
their
spoils
back
to
their
mysterious
homelands
on
the
great
mississippi
plain
the
seaboard
civilization
had
somehow
kept
from
going
to
its
knees
in
spite
of
them
in
this
last
generation
even
though
the
barbarians
had
the
barbarian
to
lead
them
the
seaboard
league
had
managed
to
cobble
itself
together
but
no
one
in
all
this
time
had
ever
actually
learned
or
cared
much
about
these
vicious
compactly
organized
raiders
certainly
no
one
had
learned
anything
beyond
those
facts
which
worked
to
best
advantage
on
a
battlefield
so
young
giulion
geoffrey
faced
his
problem
this
good
woman
of
the
barbarian
was
she
in
fact
a
good
woman
a
lady
and
therefore
entitled
to
aid
in
extremity
from
any
and
all
gentlemen
or
was
she
some
camp
follower
entirely
worthy
of
being
considered
a
spoil
of
combat
well
come
on
lad
the
barbarian
rumbled
impatiently
at
this
point
do
you
want
that
dugald
enjoying
tonight
along
with
everything
else
and
that
decided
geoffrey
he
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
not
liking
the
daggers
in
his
chest
but
not
liking
the
thought
of
dugald
pleasures
even
more
let
go
then
good
enough
lad
the
barbarian
chuckled
now
let
see
how
quietly
we
can
get
across
to
the
edge
of
that
fire
they
set
out
none
too
quietly
with
the
barbarian
heavy
bulk
lurching
against
geoffrey
lean
shoulder
on
occasion
and
both
of
them
uncertain
of
their
footing
in
the
darkness
but
they
made
it
across
without
being
noticed
just
two
more
figures
in
a
field
where
many
such
might
be
expected
and
that
was
what
counted
the
noise
and
confusion
attendant
on
the
dividing
of
the
spoils
was
an
added
help
they
reached
the
fringes
of
the
campfire
easily
it
was
very
interesting
the
way
history
had
doubled
back
on
itself
like
a
worm
part
of
its
body
but
it
in
the
wrong
place
at
one
end
of
the
kink
of
the
fresh
pink
scar
was
a
purulent
hell
of
fire
and
smoke
that
no
one
might
have
expected
to
live
through
yet
people
had
as
they
have
a
habit
of
doing
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
kink
in
time
giulion
geoffrey
end
harolde
dugald
time
the
barbarian
day
there
were
keeps
and
moats
in
erie
pennsylvania
vassals
in
new
brunswick
and
a
great
stinking
warren
of
low
houses
on
the
island
of
manhattan
if
it
had
taken
a
few
centuries
longer
to
recover
from
the
cauterizing
sun
bombs
these
things
might
still
have
been
but
they
might
have
had
different
names
and
human
history
might
have
been
considered
to
begin
only
a
few
hundred
years
before
even
this
had
not
happened
the
link
with
the
past
remained
there
was
a
narrow
cobbled
path
on
manhattan
with
sewage
oozing
down
the
ditch
in
its
center
which
was
still
fifth
avenue
it
ran
roughly
along
the
same
directions
as
old
broadway
not
because
there
was
no
one
who
could
read
the
yellowed
old
maps
but
because
surveying
was
in
its
second
childhood
there
was
a
barge
running
between
two
ropes
stretched
across
the
hudson
and
this
was
the
george
washington
bridge
ferry
so
it
was
only
a
kink
in
history
not
a
break
but
rome
was
not
in
a
day
hodd
savage
the
barbarian
the
man
who
had
come
out
of
the
hinterlands
to
batter
on
civilization
badly
mortared
walls
clamped
his
hand
on
giulion
geoffrey
arm
grunted
jerked
his
head
toward
the
cluster
of
nobles
standing
beside
the
campfire
and
muttered
listen
geoffrey
listened
the
nobles
were
between
him
and
the
fire
and
almost
none
of
them
were
more
than
silhouettes
here
and
there
a
man
faced
toward
the
fire
at
such
an
angle
that
geoffrey
could
make
out
the
thick
arch
of
an
eyebrow
the
jut
of
a
cheek
or
the
crook
of
a
nose
but
it
was
not
enough
for
recognition
all
the
nobles
were
dressed
in
battle
accoutrements
that
had
become
stained
or
torn
their
harness
had
shifted
their
tunics
were
askew
and
they
were
bunched
so
closely
that
the
outline
of
one
man
blended
into
the
shadow
of
the
next
the
voices
were
hoarse
from
an
afternoon
bellowing
some
were
still
drunk
with
the
acid
fire
of
exhausted
nerves
and
were
loud
others
drained
mumbled
in
the
background
like
a
chorus
of
the
stupid
gesticulating
mumbling
shouting
shadowed
lumped
into
one
knot
of
blackness
lighted
by
a
ruddy
cheekbone
here
a
gleaming
brow
there
above
an
eye
socket
as
inky
and
blank
as
a
bottomless
pit
they
were
like
something
out
of
the
wan
and
misty
ages
before
the
earth
had
had
time
to
form
completely
two
arguing
voices
rose
out
of
the
mass
those
three
barbarian
tankettes
are
i
say
yours
when
i
lie
dead
they
surrendered
to
me
because
i
pounded
them
into
submission
into
submission
indeed
you
skulked
around
their
flanks
like
a
lame
dog
and
now
that
i
taken
them
you
want
your
bone
you
were
glad
enough
to
see
me
there
when
the
battle
was
hot
call
me
a
dog
again
and
i
spit
you
like
a
rat
on
a
pitchfork
no
one
else
in
the
group
of
nobles
paid
the
two
of
them
any
attention
no
one
had
time
to
spare
for
any
quarrel
but
his
own
and
the
whole
squabbling
pile
of
them
looked
ready
to
fly
apart
at
any
moment
to
draw
sidearms
and
knives
and
flare
into
spiteful
combat
the
barbarian
spat
quietly
there
your
seaboard
league
lad
your
convocation
of
free
men
step
out
there
and
ask
for
your
lands
back
care
to
try
we
already
decided
that
would
be
wise
geoffrey
said
irritably
he
had
never
cared
much
for
these
inevitable
aftermaths
to
battle
but
it
made
him
angry
to
have
an
inland
barbarian
make
pointed
comments
i
suppose
it
different
when
win
eh
not
very
but
then
we
not
civilized
let
get
moving
lad
silently
they
skirted
the
fire
and
made
their
way
toward
the
parked
vehicles
of
the
barbarian
captured
supply
train
the
ground
was
rough
and
covered
by
underbrush
more
than
once
the
barbarian
stumbled
into
geoffrey
making
him
clench
his
jaw
against
the
pain
in
his
chest
but
he
saw
no
point
in
saying
anything
about
it
there
she
is
the
barbarian
said
in
a
husky
growl
geoffrey
peered
through
the
brush
at
an
armored
trailer
whose
flat
sides
were
completely
undecorated
except
for
a
scarlet
bearpaw
painted
on
the
door
a
lantern
gleamed
behind
the
slit
windows
and
the
barbarian
grunted
with
satisfaction
she
still
in
there
fine
we
have
this
done
in
a
couple
of
seconds
in
spite
of
the
incongruity
geoffrey
asked
curiously
what
a
second
a
division
of
time
lad
one
sixtieth
of
a
minute
oh
what
on
earth
would
you
want
to
measure
that
accurately
for
for
getting
women
out
of
trailers
in
a
hurry
lad
now
let
look
for
sentries
there
were
two
guarding
the
trailer
from
dugald
holding
geoffrey
noticed
carrying
shotguns
and
lounging
in
the
shadows
one
of
them
had
a
wineskin
geoffrey
heard
the
gurgle
plainly
and
the
other
was
constantly
turning
away
from
the
trailer
to
listen
to
the
shrieks
and
shouting
coming
from
among
the
other
vehicles
of
the
train
where
other
guards
were
not
being
quite
as
careful
of
their
masters
new
property
i
see
they
found
the
quartermaster
waggons
the
barbarian
said
drily
now
then
lad
you
work
away
toward
the
right
there
and
take
the
left
here
take
my
knife
i
wo
need
it
the
barbarian
passed
over
a
length
of
steel
as
big
as
a
but
oddly
curved
and
sharpened
down
one
side
of
the
blade
stab
if
you
can
but
if
you
have
to
cut
that
blade
go
through
a
man
forearm
remember
not
holding
one
of
those
overgrown
daggers
of
yours
and
just
why
should
i
kill
a
man
for
you
do
you
think
that
man
wo
try
to
kill
you
geoffrey
had
no
satisfactory
answer
to
that
he
moved
abruptly
off
into
the
brush
holding
the
barbarian
knife
and
wondering
just
how
far
he
was
obligated
for
a
bandaged
chest
and
half
a
pint
of
water
but
a
duty
to
his
rescuer
was
plain
enough
and
besides
just
what
else
was
there
to
do
the
blame
for
it
all
went
squarely
back
to
dugald
and
geoffrey
did
not
love
him
for
it
he
slipped
through
the
bushes
until
he
was
only
a
few
yards
from
the
man
who
had
the
wineskin
and
waited
for
the
barbarian
to
appear
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
trailer
when
it
happened
it
happened
quite
suddenly
as
these
things
will
one
moment
the
other
sentry
was
craning
his
neck
for
another
look
at
what
was
going
on
elsewhere
the
next
he
was
down
on
his
knees
croaking
through
a
compressed
throat
with
the
barbarian
arm
under
his
chin
and
a
driving
knee
ready
to
smash
at
the
back
of
his
neck
again
geoffrey
jumped
forward
toward
his
own
man
the
had
dropped
his
wineskin
in
surprise
and
was
staring
at
what
was
happening
to
his
comrade
when
he
heard
geoffrey
come
out
of
the
underbrush
the
face
he
turned
was
white
and
oddly
distended
with
shock
as
though
all
the
bones
had
drained
out
of
it
he
might
have
appeared
fierce
enough
ordinarily
but
things
were
happening
too
fast
for
him
geoffrey
had
never
killed
anyone
but
a
noble
in
his
life
not
intentionally
and
at
close
range
in
any
case
the
completely
baffled
and
helpless
look
of
this
one
somehow
found
time
to
remind
him
that
this
was
not
after
all
one
of
his
peers
that
the
man
was
hopelessly
outclassed
in
fair
combat
or
in
anything
else
for
that
matter
geoffrey
did
stop
to
weigh
the
probity
of
this
idea
it
was
the
central
tenet
of
his
education
and
environment
furthermore
there
was
some
truth
in
it
he
could
kill
the
man
he
swept
up
his
arm
and
struck
the
flat
of
the
barbarian
broad
knife
against
the
side
of
the
guard
head
and
bowled
the
man
over
with
his
rush
but
the
guard
had
a
hard
skull
he
stared
up
with
glazed
but
conscious
eyes
and
squalled
lord
geoffrey
geoffrey
hit
him
again
and
this
time
the
guard
stayed
down
but
the
damage
was
done
scrambling
to
his
feet
geoffrey
ran
over
to
the
barbarian
who
was
letting
the
other
guard
ooze
to
the
ground
we
have
to
hurry
geoffrey
panted
before
that
man
comes
back
to
his
senses
the
barbarian
gave
him
a
disgusted
look
but
nodded
hurry
we
shall
he
lurched
to
the
trailer
door
and
slapped
it
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
let
go
myka
there
was
a
scrambling
sound
inside
the
trailer
and
the
light
went
out
the
door
slid
open
and
geoffrey
found
himself
staring
at
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
seen
she
was
lithe
almost
to
the
point
of
boyishness
even
though
she
was
clearly
some
years
older
than
geoffrey
she
had
short
hair
the
color
of
hammered
copper
high
cheekbones
and
tawny
eyes
she
was
wearing
a
tunic
and
short
trousers
and
there
was
an
empty
pistol
holster
strapped
around
her
waist
obviously
she
was
not
a
lady
but
it
was
much
too
late
for
geoffrey
to
care
about
that
she
stopped
in
the
doorway
shaking
her
head
slowly
at
the
barbarian
i
swear
hodd
she
said
in
a
low
laughing
voice
one
of
these
days
you
come
back
from
the
dead
and
i
be
surprised
it
was
close
enough
this
time
the
barbarian
growled
he
jerked
his
head
toward
geoffrey
that
young
buck
over
there
knows
how
to
handle
his
enemies
once
he
learns
what
to
do
about
his
friends
i
may
have
to
retire
myka
arched
her
burning
eyebrows
oh
what
the
story
behind
that
like
to
know
we
can
always
talk
geoffrey
said
a
little
edgily
but
we
always
find
an
empty
tankette
quite
right
lad
the
barbarian
said
i
saw
some
vehicles
parked
over
that
way
those
belong
to
the
nobles
there
ought
to
be
some
captured
ones
of
yours
somewhere
around
here
with
plenty
of
guards
on
them
no
thanks
that
did
trouble
you
earlier
myka
as
you
may
have
noticed
is
more
than
a
tank
this
time
the
prize
is
worth
it
i
rather
just
slip
over
to
where
i
can
get
transportation
for
the
choosing
not
with
my
help
the
barbarian
looked
at
him
and
grunted
he
seemed
oddly
disappointed
i
would
have
bet
the
other
way
he
muttered
then
the
shaggy
head
rose
and
he
circled
myka
waist
with
one
arm
all
right
i
do
it
without
your
help
is
myka
trained
to
drive
a
tankette
and
fight
at
the
same
time
no
then
you
better
do
it
my
way
you
make
a
poor
showing
kicking
drive
levers
with
a
broken
leg
geoffrey
nodded
toward
the
right
shin
it
been
that
way
since
before
you
picked
me
up
it
i
saw
it
wobble
when
you
kneed
that
myka
looked
at
the
barbarian
sharply
worry
on
her
face
but
the
man
was
chuckling
all
right
bucko
we
do
it
your
way
fine
geoffrey
was
so
sure
it
was
suddenly
he
was
committed
not
only
to
helping
the
barbarian
escape
but
also
to
escape
with
him
he
was
faintly
surprised
at
himself
but
there
was
something
about
the
man
something
worth
saving
no
matter
what
and
there
was
the
business
now
of
having
been
recognized
once
dugald
learned
he
was
still
alive
there
would
be
a
considerable
amount
of
danger
in
staying
in
the
vicinity
of
course
he
had
only
to
stoop
over
the
unconscious
guard
with
the
barbarian
knife
with
a
quick
motion
he
tossed
the
weapon
back
to
its
owner
one
was
an
easy
choice
geoffrey
thought
simply
stealing
or
was
it
recapturing
a
tankette
and
using
it
to
drive
away
with
myka
and
the
barbarian
did
mean
he
had
to
go
all
the
way
to
the
barbarian
lands
with
them
let
the
guard
revive
and
run
to
dugald
with
the
news
all
geoffrey
had
to
do
was
to
remove
himself
a
few
miles
find
shelter
and
bide
his
time
one
recaptured
barbarian
tankette
might
not
even
be
missed
and
the
guard
might
not
be
believed
well
that
was
a
thin
hope
but
in
any
case
no
one
had
any
reason
to
suspect
the
barbarian
was
still
alive
there
be
no
general
pursuit
well
maybe
not
there
was
a
choked
to
death
by
a
stronger
arm
than
geoffrey
and
it
was
the
barbarian
woman
who
would
be
missing
there
might
be
quite
a
buzz
about
that
geoffrey
shook
his
head
in
impatient
annoyance
this
kind
of
life
demanded
a
great
deal
more
thinking
than
he
was
accustomed
to
all
these
unpredictable
factors
made
a
man
head
spin
and
then
again
maybe
they
did
the
thing
to
do
was
to
act
to
do
what
would
get
him
out
of
here
now
and
leave
him
free
tomorrow
to
do
whatever
thinking
tomorrow
demanded
with
a
little
practice
too
thinking
would
undoubtedly
come
more
easily
all
right
he
said
decisively
let
get
moving
over
in
that
direction
and
see
if
the
guards
have
gotten
a
little
careless
he
motioned
to
myka
and
the
barbarian
and
began
to
lead
the
way
into
the
underbrush
he
thrust
out
a
hand
to
pull
a
sapling
aside
and
almost
ran
into
harolde
dugald
dugald
was
almost
exactly
geoffrey
age
and
size
but
he
had
something
geoffrey
lacked
a
look
of
wolfish
wisdom
his
dark
eyes
were
habitually
slitted
and
his
mouth
oddly
always
poised
between
a
mirthless
grin
and
a
snarl
his
long
black
hair
curled
under
at
the
base
of
his
skull
and
his
hands
were
covered
with
heavy
gold
and
silver
rings
there
was
one
for
each
finger
and
thumb
and
all
of
them
were
set
with
knobby
precious
stones
his
lips
parted
now
and
his
long
white
teeth
showed
plainly
in
the
i
was
coming
back
to
inspect
my
prizes
he
said
in
a
voice
like
a
saw
chuckling
through
soft
metal
and
look
what
i
found
the
open
mouth
of
his
heavy
handmade
side
pistol
pointed
steadily
between
geoffrey
eyes
i
find
my
erstwhile
neighbor
risen
from
the
dead
and
in
the
company
of
a
crippled
enemy
and
his
leman
indeed
my
day
is
complete
the
one
thing
geoffrey
was
not
feeling
was
fear
the
strand
of
his
accumulated
rage
was
stretched
to
breaking
somewhere
far
from
the
forefront
of
his
mind
he
was
feeling
surprise
and
disappointment
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
dugald
weapon
and
of
what
it
would
do
to
his
head
at
this
range
but
geoffrey
was
not
stopping
to
think
and
dugald
was
a
bit
closer
to
him
than
he
ought
to
have
been
geoffrey
hands
seemed
to
leap
out
one
tore
the
pistol
out
of
hand
and
knocked
it
spinning
the
other
cracked
against
the
other
man
face
hard
enough
to
split
flesh
and
start
the
blood
trickling
down
dugald
cheek
the
force
of
the
combined
blows
sent
dugald
staggering
he
fell
back
crashing
into
a
bush
and
hung
against
it
stark
fear
shone
in
his
eyes
he
screamed
dugald
to
me
to
me
for
a
second
everything
went
silent
nobles
quarreling
guards
roistering
among
the
captures
suddenly
the
battlefield
was
still
then
the
reaction
to
the
rallying
cry
set
off
an
entirely
different
kind
of
hubbub
the
sound
now
was
that
of
an
alerted
pack
of
dogs
once
more
geoffrey
swept
his
hand
across
dugald
face
feeling
his
own
skin
break
over
the
knuckles
but
there
was
no
time
for
anything
else
now
they
had
to
run
and
not
in
silence
now
everything
went
by
the
board
and
the
nearest
safety
was
the
best
behind
them
as
they
tore
through
the
brush
they
could
hear
dugald
shouting
that
way
the
barbarian
with
him
the
barbarian
was
grunting
with
every
step
myka
was
panting
geoffrey
was
in
the
lead
his
throat
burning
with
every
breath
not
knowing
where
he
was
leading
them
but
trying
to
skirt
around
the
pack
of
nobles
that
would
be
running
toward
them
in
the
darkness
he
crashed
against
plated
metal
he
peered
at
it
in
the
absolute
darkness
this
far
from
the
fires
and
torches
tankette
he
said
hoarsely
empty
they
scrambled
onto
it
geoffrey
pulling
at
the
barbarian
arm
down
myka
inside
ought
to
be
room
between
steering
posts
and
motor
he
pushed
the
woman
down
through
the
hatch
and
dropped
back
to
the
ground
he
ran
to
the
crank
clipped
to
one
track
housing
and
thrust
it
into
place
you
you
have
to
hang
onto
turret
he
panted
to
the
barbarian
help
me
start
he
wound
furiously
at
the
starting
crank
until
he
felt
the
flywheel
spin
free
of
the
ratchet
and
then
engaged
the
driveshaft
the
tankette
shuddered
to
the
sudden
torque
the
motor
resisted
turned
its
shaft
reluctantly
spun
the
magneto
ignited
stuttered
coughed
and
began
to
roar
the
headlights
flickered
yellowly
glowed
up
to
brightness
as
the
engine
built
up
revolutions
the
barbarian
clinging
to
the
turret
with
one
arm
pushed
the
choke
control
back
to
halfway
and
advanced
the
spark
geoffrey
scrambled
up
the
sharply
pitched
rear
deck
clawing
for
handholds
on
the
radiator
tubing
and
dropped
into
the
turret
seat
he
took
the
controls
kicked
at
the
left
side
track
control
without
caring
for
the
moment
whether
myka
was
in
the
way
or
not
spun
the
tankette
halfway
round
and
pulled
the
throttle
out
as
far
as
it
would
go
its
engine
clamoring
its
rigid
tracks
transmitting
every
shock
and
battering
them
the
tankette
flogged
forward
through
the
brush
there
was
gunfire
booming
behind
them
and
there
were
other
motors
sputtering
into
life
there
was
no
one
among
the
nobles
to
drive
as
well
as
geoffrey
could
certainly
no
one
who
could
keep
up
with
him
at
night
in
country
he
knew
he
could
probably
depend
on
that
much
he
lit
the
carbide
lamp
over
the
panel
geoffrey
looked
at
the
crest
worked
into
the
metal
and
laughed
he
had
even
managed
to
steal
dugald
tankette
by
morning
they
were
a
good
fifty
miles
away
from
where
the
battle
had
been
fought
they
were
almost
as
far
as
the
delaware
river
and
the
ground
was
broken
into
low
hills
each
a
little
higher
than
the
last
geoffrey
had
only
been
this
far
away
from
his
home
a
few
times
before
his
father
death
and
then
never
in
this
direction
civilization
was
not
considered
to
extend
this
far
inland
when
a
young
man
went
on
his
travels
preparatory
for
the
day
when
he
inherited
his
father
holdings
and
settled
down
to
maintain
them
he
went
along
the
coast
perhaps
as
far
as
philadelphia
or
hartford
geoffrey
had
always
had
a
lively
interest
in
strange
surroundings
he
had
regretted
the
day
his
journeyings
came
to
an
end
not
that
he
had
regretted
his
father
passing
even
more
now
as
dawn
came
up
behind
them
he
could
not
help
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
looking
at
the
strangely
humped
land
seeing
for
the
first
time
a
horizon
which
was
not
flat
he
found
himself
intrigued
by
the
thought
that
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
lay
beyond
the
next
hill
that
he
would
have
to
travel
and
keep
traveling
to
satisfy
a
perpetually
renewed
curiosity
all
this
occupied
one
part
of
his
mind
simultaneously
he
wondered
how
much
farther
they
travel
in
this
vehicle
the
huge
engine
was
by
now
delivering
about
of
its
rated
fifty
horsepower
with
a
good
half
of
its
spark
plugs
hopelessly
fouled
and
the
carburetor
choked
by
the
dust
of
yesterday
battle
they
were
very
low
on
shot
and
powder
charges
for
the
turret
cannon
as
well
the
tankette
had
of
course
never
been
serviced
after
the
battle
there
was
one
good
thing
neither
had
their
pursuers
looking
back
geoffrey
could
see
no
sign
of
them
but
he
could
also
see
the
plain
imprint
of
the
tankette
steel
cleats
stretched
out
behind
them
in
a
betraying
line
the
rigid
unsprung
track
left
its
mark
on
hard
stone
as
easily
as
it
did
in
soft
earth
the
wonder
was
that
the
tracks
had
not
quite
worn
themselves
out
as
yet
though
all
the
rivets
were
badly
strained
and
the
tankette
sounded
like
a
barrel
of
stones
tumbling
downhill
the
barbarian
had
spent
the
night
with
one
arm
thrown
over
the
cannon
barrel
and
the
fingers
of
his
other
hand
hooked
over
the
edge
of
the
turret
hatch
in
spite
of
the
tankette
vicious
jouncing
he
had
not
moved
or
changed
his
position
now
he
raised
one
hand
to
comb
the
shaggy
hair
away
from
his
forehead
and
there
were
faint
bloody
marks
on
the
hatch
how
much
farther
until
we
over
the
mountains
geoffrey
asked
him
over
the
lad
we
have
even
come
to
the
beginning
of
them
yet
geoffrey
grimaced
then
we
never
make
it
not
in
this
vehicle
i
did
expect
to
we
walk
until
we
reach
the
pass
i
got
a
support
camp
set
up
there
walk
this
is
impossible
country
for
people
on
foot
there
are
intransigent
tribesmen
all
through
this
territory
how
do
you
know
how
do
i
why
everybody
knows
about
them
the
barbarian
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
and
with
just
the
faintest
trace
of
amusement
well
if
knows
they
intransigent
i
guess
they
are
i
guess
we
just
have
to
hope
they
do
spot
us
geoffrey
was
a
little
nettled
by
the
barbarian
manner
it
was
after
all
as
if
anybody
claimed
there
were
dragons
or
monsters
or
any
other
such
oceanic
thing
living
here
this
was
good
solid
fact
people
had
actually
come
up
here
tried
to
bring
civilization
to
the
tribes
and
failed
completely
they
were
by
all
reports
hairy
dirty
people
equipped
with
accurate
rifles
no
one
had
bothered
to
press
the
issue
because
obviously
it
was
hardly
worth
it
geoffrey
had
expected
to
have
trouble
with
them
but
he
had
expected
to
meet
it
in
an
armored
vehicle
but
now
that
the
mountains
had
turned
out
to
be
so
far
away
the
situation
might
grow
quite
serious
and
the
barbarian
did
seem
to
care
very
much
well
now
lad
he
was
saying
if
the
tribesmen
that
bad
maybe
your
friends
the
nobles
wo
dare
follow
us
up
here
they
follow
us
geoffrey
answered
flatly
i
slapped
face
oh
oh
i
did
understand
that
code
of
honor
that
sort
of
thing
all
the
civilized
appurtenances
it
hardly
funny
no
i
suppose
not
i
do
suppose
it
occurred
to
you
to
kill
him
on
the
spot
kill
a
in
hot
blood
sorry
code
of
honor
again
forget
i
mentioned
it
geoffrey
rankled
under
the
barbarian
barely
concealed
amusement
to
avoid
any
more
of
this
kind
of
thing
he
pointedly
turned
and
looked
at
the
terrain
behind
them
something
he
ought
to
have
done
a
little
earlier
three
tankettes
were
in
sight
only
a
few
miles
behind
them
laboring
down
the
slope
of
a
hill
and
at
that
moment
as
though
rivetted
iron
had
a
dramatic
sense
of
its
own
their
tankette
coughed
spun
lazily
on
one
track
as
the
crankshaft
paused
with
a
cam
squarely
between
positions
and
burned
up
the
last
drops
of
oil
and
alcohol
in
its
fuel
tank
geoffrey
and
myka
crouched
down
in
a
brushy
hollow
the
barbarian
had
crawled
up
to
the
lip
of
the
depression
and
was
peering
through
a
clump
of
weeds
at
the
oncoming
trio
that
seems
to
be
all
of
them
he
said
with
a
turn
of
his
head
it
possible
they
kept
their
speed
down
and
nursed
themselves
along
to
save
fuel
they
might
even
have
a
fuel
waggon
coming
up
behind
them
that
the
way
i
do
it
it
would
mean
these
three
are
all
we
can
expect
for
a
few
hours
anyway
but
that
they
be
heavily
reinforced
some
time
later
that
will
hardly
matter
geoffrey
muttered
myka
had
found
personal
rifle
inside
the
tankette
geoffrey
was
rolling
cartridges
quickly
and
expertly
using
torn
up
charges
from
the
turret
cannon
he
had
made
the
choice
between
a
round
or
two
for
the
now
immobile
heavy
weapon
and
a
plentiful
supply
for
the
rifle
and
would
have
been
greatly
surprised
at
anyone
choosing
differently
the
barbarian
had
not
even
questioned
it
and
myka
was
skillfully
casting
bullets
with
the
help
of
the
hissing
alcohol
stove
and
the
bullet
mold
included
in
the
rifle
kit
there
was
plenty
of
finely
ground
priming
powder
and
even
though
geoffrey
was
neither
weighing
the
charges
of
cannon
powder
nor
measuring
the
diameter
of
the
cartridges
he
was
rolling
no
young
noble
of
any
pretensions
whatsoever
could
not
have
done
the
same
the
rub
lay
in
the
fact
that
none
of
this
was
liable
to
do
them
much
good
if
they
were
to
flee
through
the
woods
there
would
certainly
be
time
for
only
a
shot
or
two
when
the
tribesmen
found
them
if
the
rifle
was
to
be
used
against
the
three
nobles
then
it
was
necessary
in
all
decency
to
wait
until
the
nobles
had
stopped
climbed
out
of
their
tankettes
equipped
themselves
equally
and
a
mutual
ground
of
battle
had
been
agreed
upon
in
that
case
three
against
one
would
make
short
work
of
it
the
better
chance
lay
with
the
woods
and
the
tribesmen
it
was
the
better
chance
but
geoffrey
did
not
relish
it
he
scowled
as
he
dropped
a
primer
charge
down
the
rifle
barrel
followed
it
with
a
cartridge
took
a
cooled
bullet
from
myka
and
tamped
it
down
with
the
ramrod
until
it
was
firmly
gripped
by
the
collar
on
the
cartridge
he
took
a
square
of
clean
flannel
from
its
compartment
in
the
butt
and
carefully
wiped
the
lenses
of
the
telescopic
sight
can
i
stop
now
myka
asked
geoffrey
looked
at
her
sharply
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
woman
might
simply
be
humoring
him
and
yet
that
was
the
tone
her
voice
had
taken
truth
to
tell
he
had
simply
handed
her
the
stove
pig
lead
and
mold
and
told
her
to
go
to
work
he
looked
at
her
now
remembering
that
he
been
hurried
and
possibly
brusque
it
ought
not
to
matter
though
it
did
since
she
was
hardly
a
lady
entitled
to
courtesy
she
hardly
looked
like
anything
after
hours
crouched
inside
the
tankette
her
copper
hair
was
smeared
with
grease
disarranged
and
even
singed
where
she
had
presumably
leaned
against
a
hot
fitting
her
clothes
were
indescribably
dirty
and
limp
with
perspiration
she
was
quite
pale
and
seemed
to
be
fighting
nausea
hardly
surprising
with
the
exhaust
fumes
that
must
have
been
present
in
the
compartment
nevertheless
her
hair
glinted
where
the
sun
struck
it
and
her
litheness
was
only
accented
by
the
wrinkled
clothing
geoffrey
thought
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
the
length
of
limb
revealed
by
her
short
trousers
he
flushed
of
course
thank
you
he
looked
at
the
pile
of
finished
bullets
there
were
enough
of
them
to
stand
off
an
army
provided
only
the
army
did
not
shift
about
behind
rocks
and
trees
as
the
tribesmen
did
or
was
not
equally
armed
as
the
nobles
would
be
yet
a
man
had
to
try
to
the
end
you
do
expect
this
to
do
much
good
he
said
to
the
woman
myka
grinned
at
him
do
you
no
frankly
but
why
did
you
help
me
to
keep
you
busy
i
see
he
did
he
scooped
the
bullets
up
put
them
in
one
pocket
and
dropped
the
cartridges
in
another
he
stood
up
there
was
any
point
in
letting
you
get
nervous
myka
explained
you
can
be
quite
a
deadly
boy
in
action
if
what
i
seen
and
heard
about
you
is
any
indication
i
did
want
you
killing
any
of
our
friends
she
was
smiling
at
him
without
any
malice
whatsoever
rather
with
a
definite
degree
of
fondness
geoffrey
did
not
even
feel
resentful
at
this
business
of
being
casually
managed
as
though
he
were
liable
to
do
something
foolish
but
he
scrambled
up
to
a
place
beside
the
barbarian
in
a
burst
of
tense
movement
and
looked
out
toward
the
approaching
tankettes
what
myka
had
just
said
to
him
and
the
cryptic
smile
on
the
barbarian
face
and
a
thought
of
geoffrey
own
had
all
fitted
themselves
together
in
his
mind
there
was
no
reason
really
to
believe
that
barbarians
would
be
hostile
to
barbarians
and
certainly
the
inland
raiders
could
not
have
returned
year
after
year
without
means
of
handling
the
mountain
tribes
friendship
or
at
least
an
alliance
would
be
the
easiest
way
and
out
on
the
slope
of
the
nearest
hill
bearded
men
in
homespun
clothing
were
rolling
boulders
down
on
the
advancing
tankettes
the
slope
of
the
hill
was
quite
steep
and
the
boulders
were
massive
they
tumbled
and
bounded
with
a
speed
that
must
have
seemed
terrifying
from
below
tearing
great
chunks
out
of
the
earth
they
rumbled
down
on
the
tankettes
while
the
tribesmen
yelled
with
bloodcurdling
ferocity
and
fired
on
the
tankettes
with
impossible
rapidity
with
respectable
marksmanship
too
the
nobles
were
swerving
their
vehicles
frantically
from
side
to
side
trying
to
avoid
the
boulders
but
their
ability
to
do
so
was
being
destroyed
by
bullets
that
ricocheted
viciously
off
the
canted
forepeak
plating
all
three
of
them
were
blundering
about
like
cattle
attacked
by
stinging
insects
only
the
lead
tankette
was
still
under
anything
like
intelligent
control
it
lurched
away
from
three
boulders
in
succession
swinging
on
its
treads
and
continuing
to
churn
its
way
up
the
hillside
geoffrey
saw
the
other
two
tankettes
struck
almost
simultaneously
one
took
a
boulder
squarely
between
its
tracks
and
stopped
in
a
shower
of
rock
fragments
the
track
cleats
bit
futilely
at
the
ground
the
vehicle
stalled
the
boulder
jammed
against
it
the
impact
did
not
seem
to
have
been
particularly
severe
but
the
entire
body
of
the
tankette
had
been
buckled
and
accordioned
possibly
only
the
boulder
own
bulk
between
the
tracks
had
kept
them
from
coming
together
like
the
knees
of
a
gored
ox
it
was
impossible
to
tell
where
in
that
crushed
bulk
the
turret
and
its
occupant
might
be
the
other
tankette
took
its
boulder
squarely
in
the
flank
it
began
to
roll
over
immediately
hurtling
back
down
the
hill
its
driver
half
in
and
half
out
of
its
turret
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
roll
tankette
and
boulder
came
to
rest
together
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
the
stone
nosing
up
against
the
metal
geoffrey
looked
at
the
scene
with
cold
fury
that
no
fitting
way
for
a
noble
to
die
the
barbarian
who
was
sprawled
out
and
watching
calmly
nodded
his
head
probably
not
he
said
dispassionately
but
that
other
giving
a
good
account
of
himself
the
remaining
tankette
was
almost
in
among
the
tribesmen
it
had
passed
the
point
where
a
rolling
boulder
momentum
would
be
great
enough
to
do
much
damage
as
geoffrey
watched
the
man
in
the
turret
yanked
his
lanyard
and
a
solid
shot
boomed
through
the
straggled
line
of
bearded
men
if
it
had
been
grape
or
canister
it
might
have
done
a
good
deal
of
damage
but
the
cannon
had
been
loaded
with
geoffrey
tankette
in
mind
and
the
tribesmen
only
jeered
one
of
them
dashed
forward
under
the
cannon
smoking
muzzle
and
jammed
a
stone
between
the
left
side
track
and
the
massive
forward
track
roller
the
track
jammed
broke
and
whipped
back
in
whistling
fragments
the
tankette
slewed
around
while
the
unharmed
tribesman
danced
out
of
the
way
the
noble
in
the
turret
could
only
watch
helplessly
apparently
he
had
no
sidearm
geoffrey
peered
at
him
as
the
tribesmen
swarmed
over
the
tankette
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
turret
it
was
dugald
and
geoffrey
arm
still
tingled
from
the
slap
that
had
knocked
the
pistol
irretrievably
into
the
brush
at
the
battlefield
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
him
he
asked
the
barbarian
make
him
meet
the
test
of
fitness
i
suppose
fitness
geoffrey
did
not
get
the
answer
to
his
question
immediately
the
woods
all
around
him
were
stirring
and
bearded
men
in
homespun
carrying
fantastic
rifles
were
casually
walking
toward
him
the
barbarian
pushed
himself
up
to
his
feet
without
any
show
of
surprise
howdy
he
said
figured
you
were
right
around
one
of
the
tribesmen
a
gaunt
incredibly
tall
man
with
a
grizzled
beard
nodded
i
seen
you
makin
signs
while
you
was
hangin
off
that
tank
before
got
a
mark
the
barbarian
extended
his
right
arm
and
turned
his
wrist
over
a
faint
double
scar
crossed
at
right
angles
showed
in
the
skin
the
tribesman
peered
at
it
and
grunted
old
one
i
got
it
twenty
years
ago
when
i
first
came
through
here
the
barbarian
answered
double
too
ai
many
of
those
my
name
hodd
savage
oh
the
tribesman
said
his
entire
manner
changed
without
becoming
servile
it
was
respectful
he
extended
his
hand
sime
weatherby
he
and
the
barbarian
clasped
hands
that
your
woman
down
there
the
tribesman
asked
nodding
toward
myka
that
right
good
enough
for
the
first
time
weatherby
looked
directly
at
geoffrey
what
about
him
the
barbarian
shook
his
head
no
mark
the
tribesman
nodded
i
figured
from
the
way
he
was
actin
he
seemed
to
make
no
particular
signal
perhaps
none
was
needed
but
arms
were
suddenly
taken
from
behind
and
his
wrists
were
tied
we
see
if
he
can
get
him
a
mark
today
weatherby
said
he
looked
to
his
left
where
other
men
were
just
pushing
dugald
into
the
ring
they
had
formed
around
the
group
seein
as
there
two
of
them
one
of
ought
to
make
it
geoffrey
and
dugald
stared
expressionlessly
at
each
other
the
barbarian
kept
his
eyes
on
geoffrey
face
that
right
he
said
ca
have
two
men
fight
to
the
death
without
one
of
them
coming
out
alive
usually
the
tribesmen
lived
in
wooden
cabins
tucked
away
among
trees
and
hidden
in
narrow
little
valleys
geoffrey
was
surprised
to
see
windmills
and
wire
fencing
for
the
cattle
pastures
that
adjoined
their
homes
he
was
even
more
interested
in
their
rifles
which
the
tribesmen
told
him
were
repeaters
he
was
puzzled
by
the
absence
of
a
cylinder
such
as
could
be
found
on
the
generally
unreliable
revolvers
one
saw
occasionally
the
tribesmen
were
treating
both
him
and
dugald
with
a
complete
absence
of
the
savagery
he
expected
they
were
being
perfectly
if
his
hands
had
not
been
tied
geoffrey
might
not
have
been
a
prisoner
at
all
this
puzzled
him
as
well
a
prisoner
after
all
could
not
expect
to
be
treated
very
well
true
he
and
dugald
were
nobles
but
this
could
not
possibly
mean
anything
to
persons
as
uncivilized
as
mountain
tribesmen
yet
somehow
the
only
thing
that
was
done
was
that
all
of
them
the
tribesmen
the
barbarian
myka
dugald
and
he
made
their
way
to
weatherby
home
a
number
of
the
tribesmen
continued
on
their
way
from
there
going
to
their
own
homes
to
bring
their
families
to
watch
the
test
the
remainder
stayed
behind
to
post
guard
dugald
was
put
in
one
room
and
geoffrey
in
another
the
barbarian
and
myka
went
off
somewhere
with
weatherby
presumably
to
have
breakfast
geoffrey
could
smell
food
cooking
somewhere
toward
the
back
of
the
house
the
smell
sat
intolerably
on
his
empty
stomach
he
sat
for
perhaps
a
half
hour
in
the
room
which
was
almost
bare
of
furniture
there
was
a
chair
in
which
he
sat
a
narrow
bed
and
a
bureau
even
though
his
hands
were
still
tied
behind
his
back
he
did
his
best
to
search
the
room
for
something
to
help
him
though
he
had
no
idea
of
what
he
would
do
next
after
he
managed
to
escape
from
the
room
itself
the
problem
did
not
arise
because
the
room
had
been
stripped
of
anything
with
a
sharp
edge
on
which
to
cut
his
lashings
and
of
anything
else
he
might
put
to
use
these
people
had
obviously
held
prisoners
here
before
he
sat
back
down
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
wall
eventually
someone
opened
the
door
geoffrey
looked
over
and
saw
that
it
was
the
barbarian
he
looked
at
the
inlander
coldly
but
the
barbarian
did
not
seem
to
notice
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
on
top
of
everything
else
he
began
without
preamble
i
just
finished
a
hearty
breakfast
that
ought
to
really
make
you
mad
at
me
i
not
concerned
with
you
or
your
meals
geoffrey
pointed
out
the
barbarian
eyes
twinkled
it
does
bother
you
my
getting
your
help
and
then
not
protecting
you
from
these
intransigent
tribesmen
hardly
i
be
a
fool
to
expect
it
would
you
now
look
bucko
these
people
live
a
hard
way
of
life
living
on
a
mountain
is
a
good
way
not
to
live
comfortably
but
it
a
good
way
of
living
your
own
way
you
can
stand
the
gaff
these
people
can
every
one
of
them
they
got
their
marks
to
prove
it
every
last
one
of
them
has
fought
it
out
face
to
face
with
another
man
and
proved
his
fitness
to
take
up
space
in
this
territory
see
it
a
social
code
and
they
extend
it
to
cover
any
stranger
who
does
get
killed
on
his
way
here
if
you
can
get
your
mark
you
welcome
here
for
the
rest
of
your
life
they
keep
their
clan
stock
fresh
and
vigorous
that
way
and
it
all
has
the
virtue
of
being
a
uniform
just
rigid
code
that
covers
every
man
in
the
group
these
barbarian
cultures
are
ever
happy
without
a
good
code
to
their
name
you
know
yours
seems
to
lack
one
the
barbarian
chuckled
oh
no
we
got
one
all
right
or
never
have
had
me
to
worry
you
nothing
we
like
better
than
a
good
talented
enemy
you
know
these
people
here
in
the
mountains
used
to
be
our
favorite
enemies
but
so
many
of
us
wound
up
getting
our
marks
it
just
got
to
be
futile
once
you
in
you
know
you
a
clan
member
that
sort
of
divided
our
loyalties
the
problem
just
seemed
to
solve
itself
though
we
understand
them
they
understand
us
we
trade
back
and
forth
hell
it
all
one
family
geoffrey
frowned
you
mean
they
got
those
rifles
from
you
sure
we
full
of
ingenuity
for
barbarians
that
is
not
in
the
same
class
with
you
seaboard
nobles
of
course
but
we
poke
along
the
barbarian
stood
up
and
his
expression
turned
serious
look
son
you
remember
that
knife
of
mine
you
borrowed
for
a
while
i
have
to
lend
it
to
you
again
in
about
twenty
minutes
your
friend
dugald
going
to
have
one
just
like
it
and
your
left
arms
are
going
to
be
tied
together
at
the
wrists
i
hope
you
remember
what
i
happened
to
tell
you
about
how
to
use
it
because
under
the
rules
of
the
code
i
not
allowed
to
instruct
you
and
geoffrey
was
left
alone
there
was
a
area
of
dirt
in
front
of
weatherby
home
and
now
its
edges
were
crowded
with
tribesmen
many
of
whom
had
brought
their
women
and
children
weatherby
together
with
a
spare
woman
and
with
the
barbarian
and
myka
sat
on
his
porch
one
of
the
tribesmen
was
wrapping
geoffrey
and
forearms
together
geoffrey
watched
him
with
complete
detachment
he
stole
a
glance
over
toward
weatherby
porch
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
myka
was
tense
and
anxious
he
could
be
sure
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
gripped
the
haft
of
the
barbarian
knife
he
held
it
with
his
thumb
along
the
blade
knowing
that
if
he
drew
his
arm
up
to
stab
downward
or
back
to
slash
dugald
would
have
a
perfect
opening
it
was
his
thought
remembering
that
blade
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
do
plenty
of
damage
with
a
simple
underhand
twist
of
his
arm
he
did
not
look
down
to
see
how
dugald
was
holding
the
knife
he
been
given
that
would
have
been
unfair
the
crowd
of
watching
tribesmen
was
completely
silent
this
was
a
serious
business
with
them
geoffrey
reflected
the
tribesman
tying
their
wrists
had
finished
the
job
he
stepped
back
anytime
after
i
say
you
boys
set
to
it
anything
goes
and
dead
man
loses
if
you
do
fight
we
kill
you
both
for
the
first
time
since
their
capture
geoffrey
looked
squarely
into
dugald
slit
eyes
i
sorry
we
have
to
do
this
to
each
other
in
this
way
dugald
he
said
go
the
tribesman
shouted
and
jumped
back
dugald
spat
at
geoffrey
face
geoffrey
twitched
his
head
involuntarily
realized
what
he
done
and
threw
himself
off
his
feet
pulling
dugald
with
him
and
just
escaping
the
downward
arc
of
plunging
knife
the
momentum
of
dugald
swing
combined
with
weight
pulled
him
completely
over
geoffrey
shoulder
the
two
of
them
jerked
abruptly
flat
on
the
ground
their
shoulders
wrenched
sprawled
out
facing
each
other
and
tied
together
like
two
cats
on
a
string
the
crowd
shouted
geoffrey
had
landed
full
on
his
ribs
and
for
a
moment
he
saw
nothing
but
a
red
mist
then
his
eyes
cleared
and
he
was
staring
into
face
dugald
snarled
at
him
and
pawed
out
with
his
knife
at
the
advantage
now
because
he
could
stab
downward
geoffrey
rolled
and
dugald
perforce
rolled
with
him
the
stab
missed
again
and
geoffrey
on
his
back
jabbed
blindly
over
his
head
and
reached
nothing
then
they
were
on
their
stomachs
again
dugald
was
panting
his
face
running
wet
the
long
black
hair
was
full
of
dust
and
his
face
was
smeared
if
ever
geoffrey
had
seen
a
man
in
an
animal
state
that
was
what
dugald
resembled
geoffrey
thought
wildly
is
this
what
a
is
i
kill
you
dugald
bayed
at
him
and
geoffrey
hackles
rose
this
is
not
a
man
he
thought
this
is
nothing
that
deserves
to
live
dugald
arm
snapped
back
knife
poised
and
drove
downward
again
geoffrey
suddenly
coiled
his
back
muscles
and
heaved
on
his
left
arm
yanking
himself
up
against
dugald
chest
he
snapped
his
hips
sideward
and
dugald
knife
missed
him
completely
for
the
third
and
fatal
time
the
barbarian
knife
slipped
upward
into
dugald
rib
cage
and
suddenly
geoffrey
was
drenched
with
blood
dugald
teeth
bit
into
his
neck
but
the
other
man
jaws
were
already
slackening
geoffrey
let
himself
slump
and
hoped
they
would
cut
this
carrion
away
from
him
as
soon
as
possible
he
heard
the
crowd
yelping
and
felt
the
barbarian
plucking
the
knife
out
of
his
hand
his
arm
was
freed
and
he
rolled
away
by
god
i
you
had
the
stuff
the
barbarian
was
booming
i
knew
they
had
to
start
breeding
men
out
on
the
coast
sooner
or
later
here
give
me
your
other
wrist
the
blade
burned
his
skin
twice
each
way
once
for
victory
and
once
for
special
aptitude
and
then
myka
pressed
a
cloth
to
the
wound
she
was
shaking
her
head
i
never
seen
it
done
better
you
a
natural
born
fighter
lad
i
got
one
of
my
sisters
all
picked
out
for
you
geoffrey
smiled
up
at
the
barbarian
a
little
ruefully
it
seems
you
and
i
be
going
back
to
the
coast
together
next
year
had
it
in
mind
all
along
lad
the
barbarian
said
if
i
ca
lick
i
be
damned
if
i
wo
make
join
me
it
an
effective
system
geoffrey
said
that
it
is
lad
that
it
is
and
now
if
you
climb
up
to
your
feet
let
go
get
you
some
breakfast
