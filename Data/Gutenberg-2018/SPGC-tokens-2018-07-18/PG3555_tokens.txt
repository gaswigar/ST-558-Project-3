savary
and
rapp
it
can
not
be
denied
that
if
from
the
brumaire
to
the
epoch
when
bonaparte
began
the
campaign
innumerable
improvements
had
been
made
in
the
internal
affairs
of
france
foreign
affairs
could
not
be
seen
with
the
same
satisfaction
italy
had
been
lost
and
from
the
frontiers
of
provence
the
austrian
camp
fires
were
seen
bonaparte
was
not
ignorant
of
the
difficulties
of
his
position
and
it
was
even
on
account
of
these
very
difficulties
that
whatever
might
be
the
result
of
his
hardy
enterprise
he
wished
to
escape
from
it
as
quickly
as
possible
he
cherished
no
illusions
and
often
said
all
must
be
staked
to
gain
all
the
army
which
the
first
consul
was
preparing
to
attack
was
numerous
well
disciplined
and
victorious
his
with
the
exception
of
a
very
small
number
of
troops
was
composed
of
conscripts
but
these
conscripts
were
commanded
by
officers
whose
ardour
was
unparalleled
bonaparte
fortune
was
now
to
depend
on
the
winning
or
losing
of
a
battle
a
battle
lost
would
have
dispelled
all
the
dreams
of
his
imagination
and
with
them
would
have
vanished
all
his
immense
schemes
for
the
future
of
france
he
saw
the
danger
but
was
not
intimidated
by
it
and
trusting
to
his
accustomed
good
fortune
and
to
the
courage
and
fidelity
of
his
troops
he
said
i
have
it
is
true
many
conscripts
in
my
army
but
they
are
frenchmen
four
years
ago
did
i
not
with
a
feeble
army
drive
before
me
hordes
of
sardinians
and
austrians
and
scour
the
face
of
italy
we
shall
do
so
again
the
sun
which
now
shines
on
us
is
the
same
that
shone
at
arcola
and
lodi
i
rely
on
massena
i
hope
he
will
hold
out
in
genoa
but
should
famine
oblige
him
to
surrender
i
will
retake
genoa
in
the
plains
of
the
scrivia
with
what
pleasure
shall
i
then
return
to
my
dear
france
ma
belle
france
at
this
moment
when
a
possible
nay
a
probable
chance
might
for
ever
have
blasted
his
ambitious
hopes
he
for
the
first
time
spoke
of
france
as
his
considering
the
circumstances
in
which
we
then
stood
this
use
of
the
possessive
pronoun
my
describes
more
forcibly
than
anything
that
can
be
said
the
flashes
of
divination
which
crossed
bonaparte
brain
when
he
was
wrapped
up
in
his
chimerical
ideas
of
glory
and
fortune
in
this
favourable
disposition
of
mind
the
first
consul
arrived
at
martigny
on
the
of
may
martigny
is
a
convent
of
bernardins
situated
in
a
valley
where
the
rays
of
the
sun
scarcely
ever
penetrate
the
army
was
in
full
march
to
the
great
bernard
in
this
gloomy
solitude
did
bonaparte
wait
three
days
expecting
the
fort
of
bard
situated
beyond
the
mountain
and
covering
the
road
to
yvree
to
surrender
the
town
was
carried
on
the
of
may
and
on
the
third
day
he
learned
that
the
fort
still
held
out
and
that
there
were
no
indications
of
its
surrender
he
launched
into
complaints
against
the
commander
of
the
siege
and
said
i
am
weary
of
staying
in
this
convent
those
fools
will
never
take
bard
i
must
go
myself
and
see
what
can
be
done
they
can
not
even
settle
so
contemptible
an
affair
without
me
he
immediately
gave
orders
for
our
departure
the
grand
idea
of
the
invasion
of
italy
by
crossing
mont
bernard
emanated
exclusively
from
the
first
consul
this
miraculous
achievement
justly
excited
the
admiration
of
the
world
the
incredible
difficulties
it
presented
did
not
daunt
the
courage
of
bonaparte
troops
his
generals
accustomed
as
they
had
been
to
brave
fatigue
and
danger
regarded
without
concern
the
gigantic
enterprise
of
the
modern
hannibal
a
convent
or
hospice
which
had
been
established
on
the
mountain
for
the
purpose
of
affording
assistance
to
solitary
travellers
sufficiently
bespeaks
the
dangers
of
these
stormy
regions
but
the
bernard
was
now
to
be
crossed
not
by
solitary
travellers
but
by
an
army
cavalry
baggage
limbers
and
artillery
were
now
to
wend
their
way
along
those
narrow
paths
where
the
cautiously
picks
his
footsteps
on
the
one
hand
masses
of
snow
suspended
above
our
heads
every
moment
threatened
to
break
in
avalanches
and
sweep
us
away
in
their
descent
on
the
other
a
false
step
was
death
we
all
passed
men
and
horse
one
by
one
along
the
goat
paths
the
artillery
was
dismounted
and
the
guns
put
into
excavated
trunks
of
trees
were
drawn
by
ropes
i
have
already
mentioned
that
the
first
consul
had
transmitted
funds
to
the
hospice
of
the
great
bernard
the
good
fathers
had
procured
from
the
two
valleys
a
considerable
supply
of
cheese
bread
and
wine
tables
were
laid
out
in
front
of
the
hospice
and
each
soldier
as
he
defiled
past
took
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
and
then
resigned
his
place
to
the
next
the
fathers
served
and
renewed
the
portions
with
admirable
order
and
activity
the
first
consul
ascended
the
bernard
with
that
calm
and
that
air
of
indifference
for
which
he
was
always
remarkable
when
he
felt
the
necessity
of
setting
an
example
and
exposing
himself
to
danger
he
asked
his
guide
many
questions
about
the
two
valleys
inquired
what
were
the
resources
of
the
inhabitants
and
whether
accidents
were
as
frequent
as
they
were
said
to
be
the
guide
informed
him
that
the
experience
of
ages
enabled
the
inhabitants
to
foresee
good
or
bad
weather
and
that
they
were
seldom
deceived
bonaparte
who
wore
his
gray
greatcoat
and
had
his
whip
in
his
hand
appeared
somewhat
disappointed
at
not
seeing
any
one
come
from
the
valley
of
aorta
to
inform
him
of
the
taking
of
the
fort
of
bard
i
never
left
him
for
a
moment
during
the
ascent
we
encountered
no
personal
danger
and
escaped
with
no
other
inconvenience
than
excessive
fatigue
on
his
arrival
at
the
convent
the
first
consul
visited
the
chapel
and
the
three
little
libraries
he
had
time
to
read
a
few
pages
of
an
old
book
of
which
i
have
forgotten
the
title
our
was
very
frugal
the
little
garden
was
still
covered
with
snow
and
i
said
to
one
of
the
fathers
you
can
have
but
few
vegetables
here
we
get
our
vegetables
from
the
valleys
he
replied
but
in
the
month
of
august
in
warm
seasons
we
have
a
few
lettuces
of
our
own
growing
when
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
mountain
we
seated
ourselves
on
the
snow
and
slid
down
those
who
went
first
smoothed
the
way
for
those
who
came
behind
them
this
rapid
descent
greatly
amused
us
and
we
were
only
stopped
by
the
mud
which
succeeded
the
snow
at
the
distance
of
five
or
six
hundred
toises
down
the
declivity
we
crossed
or
rather
climbed
up
mont
albaredo
to
avoid
passing
under
the
fort
of
bard
which
closes
the
valley
of
aorta
as
it
was
impossible
to
get
the
artillery
up
this
mountain
it
was
resolved
to
convey
it
through
the
town
of
bard
which
was
not
fortified
for
this
operation
we
made
choice
of
night
and
the
wheels
of
the
cannon
and
caissons
and
even
the
horses
feet
being
wrapped
in
straw
the
whole
passed
quietly
through
the
little
town
they
were
indeed
under
the
fire
of
the
fort
however
it
did
not
so
completely
command
the
street
but
that
the
houses
would
have
protected
them
against
any
very
fatal
consequences
a
great
part
of
the
army
had
passed
before
the
surrender
of
the
fort
which
so
completely
commands
the
narrow
valley
leading
to
aorta
that
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
the
negligence
of
the
austrians
in
not
throwing
up
more
efficient
works
by
very
simple
precautions
they
might
have
rendered
the
passage
of
bernard
unavailing
on
the
we
came
within
sight
of
the
fort
of
bard
which
commands
the
road
bounded
by
the
doria
baltea
on
the
right
and
mont
albaredo
on
the
left
the
doria
baltea
is
a
small
torrent
which
separates
the
town
of
bard
from
the
fort
bonaparte
whose
retinue
was
not
very
numerous
crossed
the
torrent
on
arriving
within
gunshot
of
the
fort
he
ordered
us
to
quicken
our
pace
to
gain
a
little
on
the
left
leading
to
the
summit
of
mont
albaredo
and
turning
the
town
and
fort
of
bard
we
ascended
this
path
on
foot
with
some
difficulty
on
reaching
the
summit
of
the
mountain
which
commands
the
fort
bonaparte
levelled
his
telescope
on
the
grass
and
stationing
himself
behind
some
bushes
which
served
at
once
to
shelter
and
conceal
him
he
attentively
reconnoitered
the
fort
after
addressing
several
questions
to
the
persons
who
had
come
to
give
him
information
he
mentioned
in
a
tone
of
dissatisfaction
the
faults
that
had
been
committed
and
ordered
the
erection
of
a
new
battery
to
attack
a
point
which
he
marked
out
and
from
whence
he
guaranteed
the
firing
of
a
few
shots
would
oblige
the
fort
to
surrender
having
given
these
orders
he
descended
the
mountain
and
went
to
sleep
that
night
at
yvree
on
the
of
june
he
learned
that
the
fort
had
surrendered
the
day
before
the
passage
of
mont
bernard
must
occupy
a
great
place
in
the
annals
of
successful
temerity
the
boldness
of
the
first
consul
seemed
as
it
were
to
have
fascinated
the
enemy
and
his
enterprise
was
so
unexpected
that
not
a
single
austrian
corps
defended
the
approaches
of
the
fort
of
bard
the
country
was
entirely
exposed
and
we
only
encountered
here
and
there
a
few
feeble
parties
who
were
incapable
of
checking
our
march
upon
milan
bonaparte
advance
astonished
and
confounded
the
enemy
who
thought
of
nothing
but
marching
back
the
way
he
came
and
renouncing
the
invasion
of
france
the
bold
genius
which
actuated
bonaparte
did
not
inspire
general
melas
the
of
the
austrian
forces
if
melas
had
had
the
firmness
which
ought
to
belong
to
the
leader
of
an
army
if
he
had
compared
the
respective
positions
of
the
two
parties
if
he
had
considered
that
there
was
no
longer
time
to
regain
his
line
of
operations
and
recover
his
communication
with
the
hereditary
states
that
he
was
master
of
all
the
strong
places
in
italy
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
massena
that
suchet
could
not
resist
him
if
then
following
bonaparte
example
he
had
marched
upon
lyons
what
would
have
become
of
the
first
consul
melas
would
have
found
few
obstacles
and
almost
everywhere
open
towns
while
the
french
army
would
have
been
exhausted
without
having
an
enemy
to
fight
this
is
doubtless
what
bonaparte
would
have
done
had
he
been
melas
but
fortunately
for
us
melas
was
not
bonaparte
we
arrived
at
milan
on
the
of
june
the
day
on
which
the
first
consul
heard
that
the
fort
of
bard
was
taken
but
little
resistance
was
opposed
to
our
entrance
to
the
capital
of
lombardy
and
the
term
engagements
can
scarcely
be
applied
to
a
few
affairs
of
advance
posts
in
which
success
could
not
be
for
a
moment
doubtful
the
fort
of
milan
was
immediately
blockaded
murat
was
sent
to
piacenza
of
which
he
took
possession
without
difficulty
and
lannes
beat
general
ott
at
montebello
he
was
far
from
imagining
that
by
that
exploit
he
conquered
for
himself
a
future
duchy
the
first
consul
passed
six
days
at
milan
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
there
a
spy
who
had
served
us
very
well
in
the
first
campaign
in
italy
was
announced
the
first
consul
recollected
him
and
ordered
him
to
be
shown
into
his
cabinet
what
are
you
here
he
exclaimed
so
you
are
not
shot
yet
general
replied
the
spy
when
the
war
recommenced
i
determined
to
serve
the
austrians
because
you
were
far
from
europe
i
always
follow
the
fortunate
but
the
truth
is
i
am
tired
of
the
trade
i
wish
to
have
done
with
it
and
to
get
enough
to
enable
me
to
retire
i
have
been
sent
to
your
lines
by
general
melas
and
i
can
render
you
an
important
service
i
will
give
an
exact
account
of
the
force
and
the
position
of
all
the
enemy
corps
and
the
names
of
their
commanders
i
can
tell
you
the
situation
in
which
alessandria
now
is
you
know
me
i
will
not
deceive
you
but
i
must
carry
back
some
report
to
my
general
you
need
not
care
for
giving
me
some
true
particulars
which
i
can
communicate
to
oh
as
to
that
resumed
the
first
consul
the
enemy
is
welcome
to
know
my
forces
and
my
positions
provided
i
know
his
and
he
be
ignorant
of
my
plans
you
shall
be
satisfied
but
do
not
deceive
me
you
ask
for
louis
you
shall
have
them
if
you
serve
me
well
i
then
wrote
down
from
the
dictation
of
the
spy
the
and
the
names
of
the
corps
their
amount
their
positions
names
of
the
generals
commanding
them
the
consul
stuck
pins
in
the
map
to
mark
his
plans
on
places
respecting
which
he
received
information
from
the
spy
we
also
learned
that
alexandria
was
without
provisions
that
melas
was
far
from
expecting
a
siege
that
many
of
his
troops
were
sick
and
that
be
wanted
medicines
berthier
was
ordered
to
draw
up
for
the
spy
a
nearly
accurate
statement
of
our
positions
the
information
given
by
this
man
proved
so
accurate
and
useful
that
on
his
return
from
marengo
bonaparte
ordered
me
to
pay
him
the
louis
the
spy
afterwards
informed
him
that
melas
was
delighted
with
the
way
in
which
he
had
served
him
in
this
affair
and
had
rewarded
him
handsomely
he
assured
us
that
he
had
bidden
farewell
to
his
odious
profession
the
first
consul
regarded
this
little
event
as
one
of
the
favours
of
fortune
in
passing
through
geneva
the
first
consul
had
an
interview
with
necker
madame
de
stael
briefly
mention
this
interview
in
her
sur
la
revolution
francaise
necker
she
says
had
an
interview
with
bonaparte
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
italy
by
the
passage
of
mont
bernard
a
few
days
before
the
battle
of
marengo
during
this
conversation
which
lasted
two
hours
the
first
consul
made
a
very
favourable
impression
on
my
father
by
the
confident
way
he
spoke
of
his
future
bourrienne
i
know
not
how
it
happened
but
at
the
time
he
did
not
speak
to
me
of
this
interview
however
i
was
curious
to
know
what
be
thought
of
a
man
who
had
acquired
much
celebrity
in
france
one
evening
when
we
were
talking
of
one
thing
and
another
i
managed
to
turn
the
conversation
on
that
subject
necker
said
he
appears
to
me
very
far
below
his
reputation
he
did
not
equal
the
idea
i
had
formed
of
him
i
tried
all
i
could
to
get
him
to
talk
but
he
said
nothing
remarkable
he
is
an
ideologist
this
was
a
constant
term
of
reproach
with
bonaparte
he
set
all
the
metaphysicians
of
the
continent
against
him
by
exclaiming
je
ne
veux
point
a
banker
it
is
impossible
that
such
a
man
can
have
any
but
narrow
views
and
besides
most
celebrated
people
lose
on
a
close
view
not
always
general
observed
i
ah
said
he
smiling
that
is
not
bad
bourrienne
you
are
improving
i
see
i
shall
make
something
of
you
in
time
the
day
was
approaching
when
all
was
to
be
lost
or
won
the
first
consul
made
all
his
arrangements
and
sent
off
the
different
corps
to
occupy
the
points
be
had
marked
out
i
have
already
mentioned
that
murat
task
was
the
occupation
of
piacenza
as
soon
as
he
was
in
possession
of
that
town
he
intercepted
a
courier
of
general
melas
the
despatch
which
was
addressed
to
the
aulic
council
of
vienna
was
delivered
to
us
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
it
announced
the
capitulation
of
genoa
which
took
place
on
the
after
the
long
and
memorable
defence
which
reflected
so
much
honour
on
massena
melas
in
his
despatch
spoke
of
what
he
called
our
pretended
army
of
reserve
with
inconceivable
contempt
and
alluded
to
the
presence
of
bonaparte
in
italy
as
a
mere
fabrication
he
declared
he
was
still
in
paris
it
was
past
three
in
the
morning
when
murat
courier
arrived
i
immediately
translated
the
despatch
which
was
in
german
about
four
i
entered
the
chamber
of
the
first
consul
whom
i
was
obliged
to
shake
by
the
arm
in
order
to
wake
him
he
had
desired
me
as
i
have
already
mentioned
never
to
respect
his
repose
an
the
arrival
of
bad
news
but
on
the
receipt
of
good
news
to
let
him
sleep
i
read
to
him
the
despatch
and
so
much
was
he
confounded
by
this
unexpected
event
that
his
first
exclamation
was
bah
you
do
not
understand
german
but
hardly
had
be
uttered
these
words
when
he
arose
and
by
eight
in
the
morning
orders
were
despatched
for
repairing
the
possible
consequences
of
this
disaster
and
countermanding
the
march
of
the
troops
on
the
scrivia
he
himself
proceeded
the
same
day
to
stradella
i
have
seen
it
mentioned
in
some
accounts
that
the
first
consul
in
person
gained
the
battle
of
montebello
this
is
a
mistake
he
did
not
leave
milan
until
the
of
june
and
that
very
day
lannes
was
engaged
with
the
enemy
the
conflict
was
so
terrible
that
lannes
a
few
days
after
describing
it
in
my
presence
to
collot
used
these
remarkable
words
which
i
well
remember
bones
were
cracking
in
my
division
like
a
shower
of
hail
falling
on
a
skylight
by
a
singular
chance
desaix
who
was
to
contribute
to
the
victory
and
stop
the
rout
of
marengo
arrived
from
egypt
at
toulon
on
the
very
day
on
which
we
departed
from
paris
he
was
enabled
to
leave
egypt
in
consequence
of
the
capitulation
of
which
happened
on
the
of
january
he
wrote
me
a
letter
dated
floreal
year
viii
of
may
announcing
his
arrival
this
letter
i
did
not
receive
until
we
reached
martigny
i
showed
it
to
the
first
consul
ah
exclaimed
he
desaix
in
paris
and
he
immediately
despatched
an
order
for
him
to
repair
to
the
headquarters
of
the
army
of
italy
wherever
they
might
be
desaix
arrived
at
stradella
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
the
first
consul
received
him
with
the
warmest
cordiality
as
a
man
for
whom
he
had
a
high
esteem
and
whose
talents
and
character
afforded
the
fairest
promise
of
what
might
one
day
be
expected
of
him
bonaparte
was
jealous
of
some
generals
the
rivalry
of
whose
ambition
he
feared
but
on
this
subject
desaix
gave
him
no
uneasiness
equally
remarkable
for
his
unassuming
disposition
his
talent
and
information
he
proved
by
his
conduct
that
he
loved
glory
for
her
own
sake
and
that
every
wish
for
the
possession
of
political
power
was
foreign
to
his
mind
bonaparte
friendship
for
him
was
enthusiastic
at
this
interview
at
stradella
desaix
was
closeted
with
the
first
consul
for
upwards
of
three
hours
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
an
order
of
the
day
communicated
to
the
army
that
desaix
was
appointed
to
the
command
of
boudet
division
boudet
was
on
terms
of
great
intimacy
with
bonaparte
who
no
doubt
was
much
affected
at
his
death
however
the
only
remark
he
made
on
receiving
the
intelligence
was
who
the
devil
shall
i
get
to
supply
boudet
place
bourrienne
the
command
given
to
desaix
was
a
corps
especially
formed
of
the
two
divisions
of
boudet
and
monnier
savary
tome
boudet
was
not
killed
at
marengo
still
less
before
see
erreurs
tome
p
i
expressed
to
bonaparte
my
surprise
at
his
long
interview
with
desaix
yes
replied
he
he
has
been
a
long
time
with
me
but
you
know
what
a
favourite
he
is
as
soon
as
i
return
to
paris
i
will
make
him
war
minister
i
would
make
him
a
prince
if
i
could
he
is
quite
an
antique
character
desaix
died
two
days
after
he
had
completed
his
year
and
in
less
than
a
week
after
the
above
observations
about
this
time
collot
came
to
italy
and
saw
bonaparte
at
milan
the
latter
received
him
coldly
though
he
had
not
yet
gained
the
battle
of
marengo
collot
hed
been
on
the
most
intimate
footing
with
bonaparte
and
had
rendered
him
many
valuable
services
these
circumstances
sufficiently
accounted
for
bonaparte
coolness
for
he
would
never
acknowledge
himself
under
obligations
to
any
one
and
he
did
not
like
those
who
were
initiated
into
certain
family
secrets
which
he
had
resolved
to
conceal
the
day
after
the
interview
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
collot
while
bonaparte
was
gone
to
review
some
corps
stationed
at
milan
collot
perfectly
understood
the
cause
of
the
unkind
treatment
he
had
experienced
and
of
which
he
gave
me
the
following
explanation
some
days
before
the
consulate
that
is
to
say
two
or
three
days
after
our
return
from
egypt
bonaparte
during
his
jealous
fit
spoke
to
collot
about
his
wife
her
levities
and
their
publicity
henceforth
said
bonaparte
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
what
would
you
part
from
her
does
not
her
conduct
justify
me
in
so
doing
i
do
not
know
but
is
this
the
time
to
think
of
such
a
thing
when
the
eyes
of
all
france
are
fixed
upon
you
these
domestic
squabbles
will
degrade
you
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
expect
you
to
be
wholly
devoted
to
their
interests
and
you
will
be
laughed
at
like
one
of
moliere
husbands
if
you
are
displeased
with
your
wife
conduct
you
can
call
her
to
account
when
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
begin
by
raising
up
the
state
after
that
you
may
find
a
thousand
reasons
for
your
resentment
when
now
you
would
not
find
one
you
know
the
french
people
well
enough
to
see
how
important
it
is
that
you
should
not
commence
with
this
absurdity
by
these
and
other
similar
remarks
collot
thought
he
had
produced
some
impression
when
bonaparte
suddenly
exclaimed
no
my
determination
is
fixed
she
shall
never
again
enter
my
house
i
care
not
what
people
say
they
will
gossip
about
the
affair
for
two
days
and
on
the
third
it
will
be
forgotten
she
shall
go
to
malmaison
and
i
will
live
here
the
public
know
enough
not
to
be
mistaken
as
to
the
reasons
of
her
removal
collot
vainly
endeavoured
to
calm
his
irritation
bonaparte
vented
a
torrent
of
reproaches
upon
josephine
all
this
violence
observed
collot
proves
that
you
still
love
her
do
but
see
her
she
will
explain
the
business
to
your
satisfaction
and
you
will
forgive
i
forgive
her
never
collot
you
know
me
if
i
were
not
sure
of
my
own
resolution
i
would
tear
out
this
heart
and
cast
it
into
the
fire
here
anger
almost
choked
his
utterance
and
he
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
as
if
tearing
his
breast
when
this
violent
paroxysm
had
somewhat
subsided
collot
withdrew
but
before
he
went
away
bonaparte
invited
him
to
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
at
ten
collot
was
there
and
as
he
was
passing
through
the
courtyard
he
was
informed
that
madame
bonaparte
who
as
i
have
already
mentioned
had
gone
to
lyons
without
meeting
the
general
had
returned
during
the
night
on
collot
entrance
bonaparte
appeared
considerably
embarrassed
he
led
him
into
a
side
room
not
wishing
to
bring
him
into
the
room
where
i
was
writing
well
said
bonaparte
to
collot
she
is
here
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
you
have
done
well
for
yourself
as
well
as
for
us
but
do
not
imagine
i
have
forgiven
her
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
suspect
the
fact
is
that
on
her
arrival
i
desired
her
to
be
gone
but
that
fool
joseph
was
there
what
could
i
do
collot
i
saw
her
descend
the
staircase
followed
by
eugine
and
hortense
they
were
all
weeping
and
i
have
not
a
heart
to
resist
tears
eugene
was
with
me
in
egypt
i
have
been
accustomed
to
look
upon
him
as
my
adopted
son
he
is
a
fine
brave
lad
hortense
is
just
about
to
be
introduced
into
society
and
she
is
admired
by
all
who
know
her
i
confess
collot
i
was
deeply
moved
i
could
not
endure
the
distress
of
the
two
poor
children
they
thought
i
for
their
mother
faults
i
called
back
eugene
and
hortense
and
their
mother
followed
them
what
could
i
say
what
could
i
do
i
should
not
be
a
man
without
some
weakness
be
assured
they
will
reward
you
for
this
they
ought
collot
they
ought
for
it
has
cost
me
a
hard
struggle
after
this
dialogue
bonaparte
and
collot
entered
the
where
i
was
then
sitting
eugene
breakfasted
with
us
but
neither
josephine
nor
hortense
i
have
already
related
how
i
acted
the
part
of
mediator
in
this
affair
next
day
nothing
was
wanting
to
complete
the
reconciliation
between
the
conqueror
of
egypt
and
the
charming
woman
who
conquered
bourrienne
on
the
the
first
consul
slept
at
torre
di
galifolo
during
the
evening
he
ordered
a
to
ascertain
whether
the
austrians
had
a
bridge
across
the
bormida
a
report
arrived
very
late
that
there
was
none
this
information
set
bonaparte
mind
at
rest
and
he
went
to
bed
very
well
satisfied
but
early
next
morning
when
a
firing
was
heard
and
he
learned
that
the
austrians
had
debouched
on
the
plain
where
the
troops
were
engaged
he
flew
into
a
furious
passion
called
the
officer
a
coward
and
said
he
had
not
advanced
far
enough
he
even
spoke
of
bringing
the
matter
to
an
investigation
from
motives
of
delicacy
i
refrain
from
mentioning
the
dame
of
the
officer
here
alluded
to
bonaparte
mounted
his
horse
and
proceeded
immediately
to
the
scene
of
action
i
did
not
see
him
again
until
six
in
tine
evening
in
obedience
to
his
instructions
i
repaired
to
san
giuliano
which
is
not
above
two
leagues
from
the
place
where
the
engagement
commenced
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
i
saw
a
great
many
wounded
passing
through
the
village
and
shortly
afterwards
a
multitude
of
fugitives
at
san
giuliano
nothing
was
talked
of
but
a
retreat
which
it
was
said
bonaparte
alone
firmly
opposed
i
was
then
advised
to
leave
san
giuliano
where
i
had
just
received
a
courier
for
the
on
the
morning
of
the
general
desaix
was
sent
towards
novi
to
observe
the
road
to
genoa
which
city
had
fallen
several
days
before
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
its
illustrious
defender
massena
i
returned
with
this
division
to
san
giuliano
i
was
struck
with
the
numerical
weakness
of
the
corps
which
was
marching
to
aid
an
army
already
much
reduced
and
dispersed
the
battle
was
looked
upon
as
lost
and
so
indeed
it
was
the
first
consul
having
asked
desaix
what
he
thought
of
it
that
brave
general
bluntly
replied
the
battle
is
completely
lost
but
it
is
only
two
we
have
time
to
gain
another
i
heard
this
from
bonaparte
himself
the
same
evening
who
could
have
imagined
that
desaix
little
corps
together
with
the
few
heavy
cavalry
commanded
by
general
kellerman
would
about
five
have
changed
the
fortune
of
the
day
it
can
not
be
denied
that
it
was
the
instantaneous
inspiration
of
kellerman
that
converted
a
defeat
into
a
victory
and
decided
the
battle
of
marengo
that
memorable
battle
of
which
the
results
were
incalculable
has
been
described
in
various
ways
bonaparte
had
an
account
of
it
commenced
no
less
than
three
times
and
i
must
confess
that
none
of
the
narratives
are
more
correct
than
that
contained
in
the
of
the
duke
of
rovigo
the
emperor
napoleon
became
dissatisfied
with
what
had
been
said
by
the
first
consul
bonaparte
for
my
part
not
having
had
the
honour
to
bear
a
sword
i
can
not
say
that
i
saw
any
particular
movement
executed
this
or
that
way
but
i
may
mention
here
what
i
heard
on
the
evening
of
the
battle
of
marengo
respecting
the
probable
chances
of
that
event
as
to
the
part
which
the
first
consul
took
in
it
the
reader
perhaps
is
sufficiently
acquainted
with
his
character
to
account
for
it
he
did
not
choose
that
a
result
so
decisive
should
be
attributed
to
any
other
cause
than
the
combinations
of
his
genius
and
if
i
had
not
known
his
insatiable
thirst
for
glory
i
should
have
been
surprised
at
the
sort
of
half
satisfaction
evinced
at
the
cause
of
the
success
amidst
the
joy
manifested
for
the
success
itself
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
this
he
was
very
unlike
jourdan
hoche
kleber
and
moreau
who
were
ever
ready
to
acknowledge
the
services
of
those
who
had
fought
under
their
orders
within
two
hours
of
the
time
when
the
divisions
commanded
by
desaix
left
san
giuliano
i
was
joyfully
surprised
by
the
triumphant
return
of
the
army
whose
fate
since
the
morning
had
caused
me
so
much
anxiety
never
did
fortune
within
so
short
a
time
show
herself
under
two
such
various
faces
at
two
all
denoted
the
desolation
of
a
defeat
with
all
its
fatal
consequences
at
five
victory
was
again
faithful
to
the
flag
of
arcola
italy
was
reconquered
by
a
single
blow
and
the
crown
of
france
appeared
in
the
perspective
at
seven
in
the
evening
when
i
returned
with
the
first
consul
to
headquarters
he
expressed
to
me
his
sincere
regret
for
the
loss
of
desaix
and
then
he
added
little
kellerman
made
a
lucky
charge
he
did
it
at
just
the
right
moment
we
are
much
indebted
to
him
you
see
what
trifling
circumstances
decide
these
affairs
these
few
words
show
that
bonaparte
sufficiently
appreciated
the
services
of
kellerman
however
when
that
officer
approached
the
table
at
which
were
seated
the
first
consul
and
a
number
of
his
generals
bonaparte
merely
said
you
made
a
pretty
good
charge
by
way
of
balancing
this
cool
compliment
he
turned
towards
bessieres
who
commanded
the
horse
grenadiers
of
the
guard
and
said
bessieres
the
guard
has
covered
itself
with
glory
yet
the
fact
is
that
the
guard
took
no
part
in
the
charge
of
kellerman
who
could
assemble
only
heavy
cavalry
and
with
this
handful
of
brave
men
he
cut
in
two
the
austrian
column
which
had
overwhelmed
desaix
division
and
had
made
prisoners
the
guard
did
not
charge
at
marengo
until
nightfall
next
day
it
was
reported
that
kellerman
in
his
first
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
at
the
dry
congratulation
he
had
received
said
to
the
first
consul
i
have
just
placed
the
crown
on
your
head
i
did
not
hear
this
and
i
can
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
its
having
been
said
i
could
only
have
ascertained
that
fart
through
bonaparte
and
of
course
i
could
not
with
propriety
remind
him
of
a
thing
which
must
have
been
very
offensive
to
him
however
whether
true
or
not
the
observation
was
circulated
about
verbally
and
in
writing
and
bonaparte
knew
it
hence
the
small
degree
of
favour
shown
to
kellerman
who
was
not
made
a
general
of
division
on
the
field
of
battle
as
a
reward
for
his
charge
at
marengo
if
savary
story
be
correct
and
he
was
then
aide
de
camp
to
desaix
and
bourrienne
acknowledges
his
account
to
be
the
best
the
inspiration
of
the
charge
did
not
come
from
the
young
kellerman
savary
says
that
desaix
sent
him
to
tell
napoleon
that
he
could
not
delay
his
attack
and
that
he
must
be
supported
by
some
cavalry
savary
was
then
sent
by
napoleon
to
a
spot
where
he
was
told
he
would
find
kellerman
to
order
him
to
charge
in
support
of
desaix
desaix
and
kellerman
were
so
placed
as
to
be
out
of
sight
of
each
other
savary
tome
pp
thiers
tome
i
follows
savary
it
may
here
be
mentioned
that
savary
in
his
account
of
the
battle
expressly
states
that
he
carried
the
order
from
bonaparte
to
kellerman
to
make
this
charge
he
also
makes
the
following
observations
on
the
subject
after
the
fall
of
the
imperial
government
some
pretended
friends
of
general
kellerman
have
presumed
to
claim
for
him
the
merit
of
originating
the
charge
of
cavalry
that
general
whose
share
of
glory
is
sufficiently
brilliant
to
gratify
his
most
sanguine
wishes
can
have
no
knowledge
of
so
presumptuous
a
pretension
i
the
more
readily
acquit
him
from
the
circumstance
that
as
we
were
conversing
one
day
respecting
that
battle
i
called
to
his
mind
my
having
brought
to
him
the
first
consul
orders
and
he
appeared
not
to
have
forgotten
that
fact
i
am
far
from
suspecting
his
friends
of
the
design
of
lessening
the
glory
of
either
general
bonaparte
or
general
desaix
they
know
as
well
as
myself
that
theirs
are
names
so
respected
that
they
can
never
be
affected
by
such
detractions
and
that
it
would
be
as
vain
to
dispute
the
praise
due
to
the
chief
who
planned
the
battle
was
to
attempt
to
depreciate
the
brilliant
share
which
general
kellerman
had
in
its
successful
result
i
will
add
to
the
above
a
few
observations
from
the
position
which
he
occupied
general
desaix
could
not
see
general
kellerman
he
had
even
desired
me
to
request
the
first
consul
to
afford
him
the
support
of
some
cavalry
neither
could
general
kellerman
from
the
point
where
he
was
stationed
perceive
general
desaix
division
it
is
even
probable
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
arrival
of
that
general
who
had
only
joined
the
army
two
days
before
both
were
ignorant
of
each
other
position
which
the
first
consul
was
alone
acquainted
with
he
alone
could
introduce
harmony
into
their
movements
he
alone
could
make
their
efforts
respectively
conduce
to
the
same
object
the
fate
of
the
battle
was
decided
by
kellerman
bold
charge
had
it
however
been
made
previously
to
general
desaix
attack
in
all
probability
it
would
have
had
a
quite
different
result
kellerman
appears
to
have
been
convinced
of
it
since
he
allowed
the
austrian
column
to
cross
our
field
of
battle
and
extend
its
front
beyond
that
of
the
troops
we
had
still
in
line
without
making
the
least
attempt
to
impede
its
progress
the
reason
of
kellerman
not
charging
it
sooner
was
that
it
was
too
serious
a
movement
and
the
consequences
of
failure
would
have
been
irretrievable
that
charge
therefore
could
only
enter
into
a
general
combination
of
plans
to
which
he
was
necessarily
a
stranger
memoirs

pp
delaforet
the
sometimes
transacted
business
with
the
first
consul
the
nature
of
this
secret
business
may
easily
be
guessed
at
when
delaforet
was
replaced
soon
after
this
by
lavalette
napoleon
ordered
the
discontinuance
of
the
practice
followed
until
then
of
allowing
letters
to
be
opened
by
subordinate
officials
this
right
was
restricted
as
in
england
to
the
minister
however
bad
this
practice
it
was
limited
not
extended
in
his
reign
see

and

p
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
their
interviews
the
first
consul
saw
a
letter
from
kellerman
to
lasalle
which
contained
the
following
passage
would
you
believe
my
friend
that
bonaparte
has
not
made
me
a
general
of
division
though
i
have
just
placed
the
crown
on
his
head
the
letter
was
sealed
again
and
sent
to
its
address
but
bonaparte
never
forgot
its
contents
whether
kellerman
did
or
did
not
give
the
crown
of
france
to
the
first
consul
it
is
very
certain
that
on
the
evening
of
the
battle
of
marengo
he
gave
him
a
supper
of
which
his
famishing
staff
and
the
rest
of
us
partook
this
was
no
inconsiderable
service
in
the
destitute
condition
in
which
we
were
we
thought
ourselves
exceeding
fortunate
in
profiting
by
the
precaution
of
kellerman
who
had
procured
provisions
from
one
of
those
pious
retreats
which
are
always
well
supplied
and
which
soldiers
are
very
glad
to
fall
in
with
when
campaigning
it
was
the
convent
del
bosco
which
on
this
occasion
was
laid
under
contribution
and
in
return
for
the
abundance
of
good
provisions
and
wine
with
which
they
supplied
the
commander
of
the
heavy
cavalry
the
holy
fathers
were
allowed
a
guard
to
protect
them
against
pillage
and
the
other
disastrous
concomitants
of
war
after
supper
was
over
the
first
consul
dictated
to
me
the
bulletin
of
the
battle
when
we
were
alone
i
said
to
him
general
here
is
a
fine
victory
you
recollect
what
you
said
the
other
day
about
the
pleasure
with
which
you
would
return
to
france
after
striking
a
grand
blow
in
italy
surely
you
must
be
satisfied
now
yes
bourrienne
i
am
satisfied
but
desaix
ah
what
a
triumph
would
this
have
been
if
i
could
have
embraced
him
on
the
field
of
battle
as
he
uttered
these
words
i
saw
that
bonaparte
was
on
the
point
of
shedding
tears
so
sincere
and
profound
was
his
grief
for
the
death
of
desaix
he
certainly
never
loved
esteemed
or
regretted
any
man
so
much
the
death
of
desaix
has
been
variously
related
and
i
need
not
now
state
that
the
words
attributed
to
him
in
the
bulletin
were
imaginary
neither
did
he
die
in
the
arms
of
his
aide
de
camp
lebrun
as
i
wrote
from
the
dictation
of
the
first
consul
the
following
facts
are
more
correct
or
at
all
events
more
probable
the
death
of
desaix
was
not
perceived
at
the
moment
it
took
place
he
fell
without
saying
a
word
at
a
little
distance
from
a
sergeant
of
battalion
of
the
brigade
light
infantry
commanded
by
barrois
seeing
him
extended
on
the
ground
asked
permission
to
pick
up
his
cloak
it
was
found
to
be
perforated
behind
and
this
circumstance
leaves
it
doubtful
whether
desaix
was
killed
by
some
unlucky
inadvertency
while
advancing
at
the
head
of
his
troops
or
by
the
enemy
when
turning
towards
his
men
to
encourage
them
however
the
event
was
so
instantaneous
the
disorder
so
complete
and
the
change
of
fortune
so
sudden
that
it
is
not
surprising
there
should
be
no
positive
account
of
the
circumstances
which
attended
his
death
early
next
morning
the
prince
of
liechtenstein
came
from
general
melas
with
negotiations
to
the
first
consul
the
propositions
of
the
general
did
not
suit
bonaparte
and
he
declared
to
the
prince
that
the
army
shut
up
in
alessandria
should
evacuate
freely
and
with
the
honours
of
war
but
on
those
conditions
which
are
well
known
and
by
which
italy
was
to
be
fully
restored
to
the
french
domination
that
day
were
repaired
the
faults
of
scherer
whose
inertness
and
imbecility
had
paralysed
everything
and
who
had
fled
and
been
constantly
beaten
from
the
adriatic
to
mont
cenis
the
prince
of
liechtenstein
begged
to
return
to
render
an
account
of
his
mission
to
general
melas
he
came
back
in
the
evening
and
made
many
observations
on
the
hard
nature
of
the
conditions
sir
replied
the
first
consul
in
a
tone
of
marked
impatience
carry
my
final
determination
to
your
general
and
return
quickly
it
is
irrevocable
know
that
i
am
as
well
acquainted
with
your
position
as
you
are
yourselves
i
did
not
begin
to
learn
the
art
of
war
yesterday
you
are
blocked
up
in
alessandria
you
have
many
sick
and
wounded
you
are
in
want
of
provisions
and
medicines
i
occupy
the
whole
of
your
rear
your
finest
troops
are
among
the
killed
and
wounded
i
might
insist
on
harder
conditions
my
position
would
warrant
me
in
so
doing
but
i
moderate
my
demands
in
consideration
of
the
gray
hairs
of
your
general
whom
i
respect
this
reply
was
delivered
with
considerable
dignity
and
energy
i
showed
the
prince
out
and
he
said
to
me
these
conditions
are
very
hard
especially
that
of
giving
up
genoa
which
surrendered
to
us
only
a
fortnight
ago
after
so
long
a
siege
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
emperor
of
austria
received
intelligence
of
the
capitulation
and
restitution
of
genoa
at
the
same
time
when
the
first
consul
returned
to
milan
he
made
savary
and
rapp
his
aides
de
camp
they
had
previously
served
in
the
same
rank
under
desaix
the
first
consul
was
at
first
not
much
disposed
to
take
them
alleging
that
he
had
aides
de
camp
enough
but
his
respect
for
the
choice
of
desaix
added
to
a
little
solicitation
on
my
part
soon
removed
every
obstacle
these
two
officers
served
him
to
the
last
hour
of
his
political
career
with
unfailing
zeal
and
fidelity
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
memoirs
of
the
due
de
rovigo
savary
about
my
having
had
anything
to
do
with
his
admission
to
the
honour
i
can
probably
tell
the
reason
why
one
of
the
two
aides
de
camp
has
risen
higher
than
the
other
rapp
had
an
alsatian
frankness
which
always
injured

the

only
thing
worthy
of
remark
in

letter
would
be
the
concluding
sentence
in
which
the
first
consul
still
affected
to
acknowledge
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
were
it
not
that
the
words
citizens
consuls
were
evidently
foisted
in
with
a
particular
design
the
battle
was
gained
and
even
in
a
trifling
matter
like
this
it
was
necessary
that
the
two
other
consuls
should
feel
that
they
were
not
so
much
the
colleagues
as
the
subordinates
of
the
first
consul
we
returned
to
milan
and
our
second
occupation
of
that
city
was
marked
by
continued
acclamations
wherever
the
first
consul
showed
himself
at
milan
the
first
consul
now
saw
massena
for
the
first
time
since
our
departure
for
egypt
bonaparte
lavished
upon
him
the
highest
praises
but
not
higher
than
he
deserved
for
his
admirable
defence
of
genoa
he
named
him
his
successor
in
the
command
of
the
army
of
italy
moreau
was
on
the
rhine
and
therefore
none
but
the
conqueror
of
zurich
could
properly
have
succeeded
the
first
consul
in
that
command
the
great
blow
was
struck
but
there
might
still
occur
an
emergency
requiring
the
presence
of
a
skillful
experienced
general
well
acquainted
with
the
country
and
besides
we
could
not
be
perfectly
at
ease
until
it
was
ascertained
what
conditions
would
be
adhered
to
by
the
cabinet
of
vienna
which
was
then
entirely
under
the
influence
of
the
cabinet
of
london
after
our
return
from
the
battle
the
popular
joy
was
general
and
heartfelt
not
only
among
the
higher
and
middle
ranks
of
society
but
in
all
classes
and
the
affection
evinced
from
all
quarters
to
the
first
consul
was
unfeigned
in
what
a
tone
of
sincerity
did
he
say
to
me
one
day
when
returning
from
the
parade
bourrienne
do
you
hear
the
acclamations
still
resounding
that
noise
is
as
sweet
to
me
as
the
sound
of
josephine
voice
how
happy
and
proud
i
am
to
be
loved
by
such
a
people
during
our
stay
at
milan
bonaparte
had
arranged
a
new
government
for
piedmont
he
had
ever
since
cherished
the
wish
to
unite
that
rich
and
fertile
country
to
the
french
territory
because
some
piedmontese
provinces
had
been
possessed
by
louis
xiv
that
monarch
was
the
only
king
whom
the
first
consul
really
admired
if
said
he
one
day
louis
xiv
had
not
been
born
a
king
he
would
have
been
a
great
man
but
he
did
not
know
mankind
he
could
not
know
them
for
he
never
knew
misfortune
he
admired
the
resolution
of
the
old
king
who
would
rather
bury
himself
under
the
ruins
of
the
monarchy
than
submit
to
degrading
conditions
after
having
commanded
the
sovereigns
of
europe
i
recollect
that
bonaparte
was
extremely
pleased
to
see
in
the
reports
which
he
ordered
to
be
made
that
in
casal
and
in
the
valleys
of
pignerol
latour
and
luzerne
there
still
existed
many
traces
of
the
period
when
those
countries
belonged
to
france
and
that
the
french
language
was
yet
preserved
there
he
already
began
to
identify
himself
with
the
past
and
abusing
the
old
kings
of
france
was
not
the
way
to
conciliate
his
favour
the
first
consul
appointed
for
the
government
of
piedmont
a
council
which
as
may
naturally
be
imagined
he
composed
of
those
piedmontese
who
were
the
declared
partisans
of
france
he
stated
as
the
grounds
of
this
arrangement
that
it
was
to
give
to
piedmont
a
new
proof
of
the
affection
and
attachment
of
the
french
people
he
afterwards
appointed
general
dupont
president
of
the
council
with
the
title
of
of
the
french
government
i
will
here
mention
a
secret
step
taken
by
bonaparte
towards
the
overthrowing
of
the
republic
in
making
the
first
draught
of
general
dupont
appointment
i
had
mechanically
written
of
the
french
no
no
said
bonaparte
not
of
the
republic
say
of
the
government
on
his
return
to
paris
the
first
consul
gave
almost
incredible
proofs
of
his
activity
the
day
after
his
arrival
he
promulgated
a
great
number
of
decrees
and
afterwards
allotted
the
rewards
to
his
soldiers
he
appointed
kellerman
general
of
division
which
on
every
principle
of
justice
he
ought
to
have
done
on
the
field
of
battle
he
distributed
sabres
of
honour
with
the
following
inscription
highly
complimentary
to
himself

or
in
the
army
of
the
rhine
for
bonaparte
took
care
that
the
officers
and
men
who
had
fought
under
moreau
should
be
included
among
those
to
whom
the
national
rewards
were
presented
he
even
had
a
medal
struck
to
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
entry
of
the
french
army
into
munich
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
while
official
fabrications
and
exaggerated
details
of
facts
were
published
respecting
marengo
and
the
short
campaign
of
italy
by
a
feigned
modesty
the
victorious
army
of
marengo
received
the
unambitious
title
of
of
reserve
by
this
artifice
the
honour
of
the
constitution
was
saved
the
first
consul
had
not
violated
it
if
he
had
marched
to
the
field
and
staked
everything
on
a
chance
it
was
merely
accidentally
for
he
commanded
only
an
army
of
reserve
which
nevertheless
he
had
greeted
with
the
title
of
grand
army
before
he
entered
upon
the
campaign
it
is
scarcely
conceivable
that
bonaparte
possessing
as
he
did
an
extraordinary
mind
should
have
descended
to
such
pitiful
artifices
thiers
tome
says
the
title
grande
armee
was
first
given
by
napoleon
to
the
force
prepared
in
for
the
campaign
against
austria
the
constitution
forbad
the
first
consul
to
command
the
armies
in
person
hence
the
title
army
of
reserve
gives
to
the
force
which
fought
marengo
even
foreigners
and
prisoners
were
objects
of
bonaparte
designing
intentions
i
recollect
one
evening
his
saying
to
me
bourrienne
write
to
the
minister
of
war
and
tell
him
to
select
a
fine
brace
of
pistols
of
the
versailles
manufacture
and
send
them
in
my
name
to
general
zach
he
dined
with
me
and
highly
praised
our
manufacture
of
arms
i
should
like
to
give
him
a
token
of
remembrance
besides
the
matter
will
be
talked
of
at
vienna
and
may
perhaps
do
good
as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
battle
of
marengo
reached
paris
lucien
bonaparte
minister
of
the
interior
ordered
preparations
for
the
festival
fixed
for
the
of
july
in
commemoration
of
the
first
federation
this
festival
and
that
of
the
vendemiaire
were
the
only
ones
preserved
by
the
consular
government
indeed
in
those
memorable
days
when
the
revolution
appeared
in
its
fairest
point
of
view
france
had
never
known
such
joy
as
that
to
which
the
battle
of
marengo
gave
rise
still
amidst
all
this
popular
transport
there
was
a
feeling
of
regret
the
fame
of
desaix
his
heroic
character
his
death
the
words
attributed
to
him
and
believed
to
be
true
caused
mourning
to
be
mingled
with
joy
it
was
agreed
to
open
a
subscription
for
erecting
a
national
monument
to
his
memory
a
reflection
naturally
arises
here
upon
the
difference
between
the
period
referred
to
and
the
present
time
france
has
endowed
with
nearly
a
million
the
children
of
one
of
her
greatest
orators
and
most
eloquent
defenders
of
public
liberty
yet
for
the
monument
to
the
memory
of
desaix
scarcely
francs
were
subscribed
does
not
this
form
a
singular
contrast
with
the
patriotic
munificence
displayed
at
the
death
of
general
foy
the
pitiful
monument
to
desaix
on
the
place
dauphins
sufficiently
attests
the
want
of
spirit
on
the
part
of
the
subscribers
bonaparte
who
was
much
dissatisfied
with
it
gave
the
name
of
desaix
to
a
new
quay
the
first
stone
of
which
was
laid
with
great
solemnity
on
the
of
july
on
that
day
the
crowd
was
immense
in
the
and
in
the
temple
of
mars
the
name
which
at
that
the
church
of
the
invalides
still
preserved
lucien
delivered
a
speech
on
the
encouraging
prospects
of
france
and
lannes
made
an
appropriate
address
on
presenting
to
the
government
the
flags
taken
at
marengo
two
more
followed
one
from
an
aide
de
cramp
of
massena
and
the
other
from
an
aide
de
camp
of
lecourbe
and
after
the
distribution
of
some
medals
the
first
consul
then
delivered
the
following
address
citizens
soldiers
the
flags
presented
to
the
government
in
the
presence
of
the
people
of
this
immense
capital
attest
at
once
the
genius
of
the
moreau
massena
and
berthier
the
military
talents
of
the
generals
their
lieutenants
and
bravery
of
the
french
soldiers
on
your
return
to
the
camp
tell
your
comrades
that
for
the
vendemiaire
when
we
shall
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
the
republic
the
french
people
expect
either
peace
or
if
the
enemy
obstinately
refuse
it
other
flags
the
fruit
of
fresh
victories
after
this
harangue
of
the
first
consul
in
which
he
addressed
to
the
military
in
the
name
of
the
people
and
ascribed
to
berthier
the
glory
of
marengo
a
hymn
was
chanted
the
words
of
which
were
written
by
de
fontanes
and
the
music
composed
by
mehul
but
what
was
most
remarkable
in
this
fete
was
neither
the
poetry
music
nor
even
the
panegyrical
eloquence
of
lucien
it
was
the
arrival
at
the
after
the
ceremony
at
the
invalides
of
the
consular
guard
returning
from
marengo
i
was
at
a
window
of
the
and
i
can
never
forget
the
commotion
almost
electrical
which
made
the
air
resound
with
cries
of
enthusiasm
at
their
appearance
these
soldiers
did
not
defile
before
the
first
consul
in
fine
uniforms
as
at
a
review
leaving
the
field
of
battle
when
the
firing
ceased
they
had
crossed
lombardy
piedmont
mont
cenis
savoy
and
france
in
the
space
of
days
they
appeared
worn
by
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
with
faces
browned
by
the
summer
sun
of
italy
and
with
their
arms
and
clothing
showing
the
effects
of
desperate
struggles
do
you
wish
to
have
an
idea
of
their
appearance
you
will
find
a
perfect
type
in
the
first
grenadier
put
by
gerard
at
one
side
of
his
picture
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
at
the
time
of
this
fete
that
is
to
say
in
the
middle
of
the
month
of
july
the
first
consul
could
not
have
imagined
that
the
moderate
conditions
he
had
proposed
after
the
victory
would
not
be
accepted
by
austria
in
the
hope
therefore
of
a
peace
which
could
not
but
be
considered
probable
he
for
the
first
time
since
the
establishment
of
the
consular
government
convoked
the
deputies
of
the
departments
and
appointed
their
time
of
assembling
in
paris
for
the
vendemiaire
a
day
which
formed
the
close
of
one
remarkable
century
and
marked
the
commencement
of
another
the
remains
of
marshal
turenne
to
which
louis
xiv
had
awarded
the
honours
of
annihilation
by
giving
them
a
place
among
the
royal
tombs
in
the
vaults
of
denis
had
been
torn
from
their
grave
at
the
time
of
the
sacrilegious
violation
of
the
tombs
his
bones
mingled
indiscriminately
with
others
had
long
lain
in
obscurity
in
a
garret
of
the
college
of
medicine
when
lenoir
collected
and
restored
them
to
the
ancient
tomb
of
turenne
in
the
mussee
des
petits
augustins
resolved
to
enshrine
these
relics
in
that
sculptured
marble
with
which
the
glory
of
turenne
could
so
well
dispense
this
was
however
intended
as
a
connecting
link
between
the
past
days
of
france
and
the
future
to
which
he
looked
forward
he
thought
that
the
sentiments
inspired
by
the
solemn
honours
rendered
to
the
memory
of
turenne
would
dispose
the
deputies
of
the
departments
to
receive
with
greater
enthusiasm
the
pacific
communications
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
make
however
the
negotiations
did
not
take
the
favourable
turn
which
the
first
consul
had
expected
and
notwithstanding
all
the
address
of
lucien
the
communication
was
not
heard
without
much
uneasiness
but
lucien
had
prepared
a
speech
quite
to
the
taste
of
the
first
consul
after
dilating
for
some
time
on
the
efforts
of
the
government
to
obtain
peace
he
deplored
the
tergiversations
of
austria
accused
the
fatal
influence
of
england
and
added
in
a
more
elevated
and
solemn
tone
at
the
very
moment
when
the
consuls
were
leaving
the
palace
of
the
government
a
courier
arrived
bearing
despatches
which
the
first
consul
has
directed
me
to
communicate
to
you
he
then
read
a
note
declaring
that
the
austrian
government
consented
to
surrender
to
france
the
three
fortresses
of
ulm
philipsburg
and
ingolstadt
this
was
considered
as
a
security
for
the
preliminaries
of
peace
being
speedily
signed
the
news
was
received
with
enthusiasm
and
that
anxious
day
closed
in
a
way
highly
gratifying
to
the
first
consul
whilst
victory
confirmed
in
italy
the
destinies
of
the
first
consul
his
brothers
were
more
concerned
about
their
own
interests
than
the
affairs
of
france
they
loved
money
as
much
as
bonaparte
loved
glory
a
letter
from
lucien
to
his
brother
joseph
which
i
shall
subjoin
shows
how
ready
they
always
were
to
turn
to
their
own
advantage
the
glory
and
fortune
of
him
to
whom
they
were
indebted
for
all
their
importance
i
found
this
letter
among
my
papers
but
i
can
not
tell
why
and
how
i
preserved
it
it
is
interesting
inasmuch
as
it
shows
the
opinion
that
family
of
future
kings
entertained
of
their
own
situation
and
of
what
their
fate
would
have
been
had
bonaparte
like
desaix
fallen
on
the
field
of
marengo
it
is
besides
curious
to
observe
the
philosopher
lucien
causing
te
deum
to
be
chanted
with
the
view
of
influencing
the
public
funds
at
all
events
i
copy
lucien
letter
as
he
wrote
it
giving
the
words
marked
in
italics
caps
and
the
numerous
notes
of
exclamation
which
distinguish
the
original
my
brother
i
send
you
a
courier
i
particularly
wish
that
the
first
consul
would
give
me
notice
of
his
arrival
hours
beforehand
and
that
he
would
inform
me
alone
of
the
barrier
by
which
he
will
enter

city

to
prepare
triumphal
arches
for
him

it
deserves
not
to
be
disappointed

my
request
a

this
intrigue
so
called

one

its

the

many
of
the
most
influential
men
to
be
prepared
in
case
of
the
death
of
napoleon
in
any
action
in
italy
it
was
simply
a
continuation
of
the
same
combinations
which
had
been
attempted
or
planned
in
till
the
arrival
of
bonaparte
from
egypt
made
the
party
choose
him
as
the
instrument
for
the
overthrow
of
the
directors

was
little

he

expenses
to

we
departed
amidst
the
acclamations
of
the
inhabitants
and
took
the
road
to
turin
the
first
consul
stopped
at
turin
for
some
hours
and
inspected
the
citadel
which
had
bean
surrendered
to
us
in
pursuance
of
the
capitulation
of
alessandria
in
passing
over
mont
cenis
we
observed
the
carriage
of
madame
kellerman
who
was
going
to
meet
her
husband
bonaparte
on
recognizing
the
lady
stopped
his
carriage
and
congratulated
her
on
the
gallant
conduct
of
her
husband
at
the
battle
of

on
our
arrival
at
lyons
we
alighted
at
the
hotel
des
celestins
and
the
loud
acclamations
of
a
numerous
multitude
assembled
round
the
hotel
obliged
bonaparte
to
show
himself
on
the
balcony
next
day
he
proceeded
to
the
square
of
bellecour
where
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
people
he
laid
the
first
stone
of
some
new
buildings
destined
to
efface
one
of
the
disasters
of
the
revolution
we
left
lyons
that
evening
and
continued
our
journey
by
way
of
dijon
on
our
arrival
in
that
town
the
joy
of
the
inhabitants
was
very
great
i
never
saw
a
more
graceful
and
captivating
sight
than
that
which
was
presented
by
a
group
of
beautiful
young
females
crowned
with
flowers
who
accompanied
bonaparte
carriage
and
which
at
that
period
when
the
revolution
had
renewed
all
the
republican
recollections
of
greece
and
rome
looked
like
the
chorus
of
females
dancing
around
the
victor
at
the
olympic
games
but
all
our
journey
was
not
so
agreeable
some
accidents
awaited
us
the
first
consul
carriage
broke
down
between
and
sens
he
sent
a
courier
to
inform
my
mother
that
he
would
stop
at
her
house
till
his
carriage
was
repaired
he
dined
there
and
we
started
again
at
seven
in
the
evening
but
we
had
other
disasters
to
encounter
one
of
our
came
off
and
as
we
were
driving
at
a
very
rapid
pace
the
carriage
was
overturned
on
the
bridge
at
a
short
distance
from
the
first
consul
who
sat
on
my
left
fell
upon
me
and
sustained
no
injury
my
head
was
slightly
hurt
by
striking
against
some
things
which
were
in
the
pocket
of
the
carriage
but
this
accident
was
not
worth
stopping
for
and
we
arrived
at
paris
on
the
same
night
the
of
july
duroc
who
was
the
third
in
the
carriage
was
not
hurt
i
have
already
mentioned
that
bonaparte
was
rather
talkative
when
travelling
and
as
we
were
passing
through
burgundy
on
our
return
to
paris
from
marengo
he
said
exultingly
well
a
few
more
events
like
this
campaign
and
i
may
go
down
to
posterity
i
think
replied
i
that
you

already

enough
to
secure
great

years

for
all
that
my
dear

were
i
to
die
i
should
not
at
the
end
of
ten
centuries
occupy
half
a
page
of
general
history
on
the
very
day
when
desaix
fell
on

field
of

kleber
was
assassinated
by
a
fanatical
mussulman
named

blow

was
at
most
eighteen
or
twenty
years
of
age
he
was
a
native
of
damascus
and
declared
that
he
had
quitted
his
native
city
by
command
of
the
grand
vizier
who
had
entrusted
him
with
the
commission
of
repairing
to
egypt
and
killing
the
grand
sultan
of
the
french
bonaparte
being
probably
intended
that
for
this
purpose
alone
he
had
left
his
family
and
performed
the
whole
journey
on
foot
and
had
received
from
the
grand
vizier
no
other
money
than
what
was
absolutely
requisite
for
the
exigencies
of
the
journey
on
arriving
at
cairo
he
had
gone
forthwith
to
perform
his
devotions
in
the
great
mosque
and
it
was
only
on
the
eve
of
executing
his
project
that
he
confided
it
to
one
of
the
scherifs
of
the
mosque
duc
de
rovigo
memoirs
tome
thus
was
france
on
the
same
day
and
almost
at
the
same
hour
deprived
of
two
of
her
most
distinguished
generals
menou
as
senior
in
command
succeeded
kleber
and
the
first
consul
confirmed
the
appointment
from
that
moment
the
loss
of
egypt
was
inevitable
i
have
a
few
details
to
give
respecting
the
tragical
death
of
kleber
the
house
of
elfy
bey
which
bonaparte
occupied
at
cairo
and
in
which
kleber
lived
after
his
departure
had
a
terrace
leading
from
a
salon
to
an
old
ruined
cistern
from
which
down
a
few
steps
there
was
an
entrance
into
the
garden
the
terrace
commanded
a
view
of
the
grand
square
of
el
beguyeh
which
was
to
the
right
on
coming
out
of
the
salon
while
the
garden
was
on
the
left
this
terrace
was
bonaparte
favourite
promenade
especially
in
the
evenings
when
he
used
to
walk
up
and
down
and
converse
with
the
persons
about
him
i
often
advised
him
to
fill
up
the
reservoir
and
to
make
it
level
with
the
terrace
i
even
showed
him
by
concealing
myself
in
it
and
coming
suddenly
behind
him
how
easy
it
would
be
for
any
person
to
attempt
his
life
and
then
escape
either
by
jumping
into
the
square
or
passing
through
the
garden
he
told
me
i
was
a
coward
and
was
always
in
fear
of
death
and
he
determined
not
to
make
the
alteration
i
suggested
which
however
he
acknowledged
to
be
advisable
kleber
assassin
availed
himself
of
the
facility
which
i
so
often
apprehended
might
be
fatal
to
bonaparte
i
shall
not
atop
to
refute
all
the
infamous
rumours
which
were
circulated
respecting
kleber
death
when
the
first
consul
received
the
unexpected
intelligence
he
could
scarcely
believe
it
he
was
deeply
affected
and
on
reading
the
particulars
of
the
assassination
he
instantly
called
to
mind
how
often
he
had
been
in
the
same
situation
as
that
in
which
kleber
was
killed
and
all
i
had
said
respecting
the
danger
of
the
reservoir
a
danger
from
which
it
is
inconceivable
he
should
have
escaped
especially
after
his
syrian
expedition
had
excited
the
fury
of
the
natives
bonaparte
knowledge
of
kleber
talents
the
fact
of
his
having
confided
to
him
the
command
of
the
army
and
the
aid
which
he
constantly
endeavoured
to
transmit
to
him
repelled
at
once
the
horrible
suspicion
of
his
having
had
the
least
participation
in
the
crime
and
the
thought
that
he
was
gratified
to
hear
of
it
it
is
very
certain
that
bonaparte
dislike
of
kleber
was
as
decided
as
the
friendship
he
cherished
for
desaix
kleber
fame
annoyed
him
for
he
was
weak
enough
to
be
annoyed
at
it
he
knew
the
manner
in
which
kleber
spoke
of
him
which
was
certainly
not
the
most
respectful
during
the
long
and
sanguinary
siege
of
jean
kleber
said
to
me
that
little
scoundrel
bonaparte
who
is
no
higher
than
my
boot
will
enslave
france
see
what
a
villainous
expedition
he
has
succeeded
in
involving
us
in
kleber
often
made
the
same
remark
to
others
as
well
as
to
me
i
am
not
certain
that
it
was
ever
reported
to
bonaparte
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
those
who
found
it
their
interest
to
accuse
others
did
not
spare
kleber
kleber
who
was
a
sincere
republican
saw
and
dreaded
for
his
sake
the
secret
views
and
inordinate
ambition
of
bonaparte
he
was
a
grumbler
by
nature
yet
he
never
evinced
discontent
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
as
a
soldier
he
swore
and
stormed
but
marched
bravely
to
the
cannon
mouth
he
was
indeed
courage
personified
one
day
when
he
was
in
the
trench
at
jean
standing
up
and
by
his
tall
stature
exposed
to
every
shot
bonaparte
called
to
him
stoop
down
kleber
stoop
down
why
replied
he
your
confounded
trench
does
not
reach
to
my
knees
he
never
regarded
the
egyptian
expedition
with
a
favourable
eye
he
thought
it
too
expensive
and
utterly
useless
to
france
he
was
convinced
that
in
the
situation
in
which
we
stood
without
a
navy
or
a
powerful
government
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
confined
our
attention
to
europe
than
to
have
wasted
french
blood
and
money
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
among
the
ruined
cities
of
syria
kleber
who
was
a
cool
reflecting
man
judged
bonaparte
without
enthusiasm
a
thing
somewhat
rare
at
that
time
and
he
was
not
blind
to
any
of
his
faults
bonaparte
alleged
that
kleber
said
to
him
general
you
are
as
great
as
the
world
such
a
remark
is
in
direct
opposition
to
kleber
character
he
was
too
sincere
to
say
anything
against
his
conviction
bonaparte
always
anxious
to
keep
egypt
of
which
the
preservation
alone
could
justify
the
conquest
allowed
kleber
to
speak
because
he
acted
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
kleber
sense
of
military
duty
would
always
triumph
over
any
opposition
he
might
cherish
to
his
views
and
plans
thus
the
death
of
his
lieutenant
far
from
causing
bonaparte
any
feeling
of
satisfaction
afflicted
him
the
more
because
it
almost
totally
deprived
him
if
the
hope
of
preserving
a
conquest
which
had
cost
france
so
dear
and
which
was
his
work
the
news
of
the
death
of
kleber
arrived
shortly
after
our
return
to
paris
bonaparte
was
anxiously
expecting
accounts
from
egypt
none
having
been
received
for
a
considerable
time
the
arrival
of
the
courier
who
brought
the
fatal
intelligence
gave
rise
to
a
scene
which
i
may
relate
here
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
the
courier
arrived
at
the
tuileries
in
his
hurry
the
first
consul
could
not
wait
to
rouse
any
one
to
call
me
up
i
had
informed
him
some
days
before
that
if
he
should
want
me
during
the
night
he
should
send
for
me
to
the
corridor
as
i
had
changed
my
bedchamber
on
account
of
my
wife
accouchement
he
came
up
himself
and
instead
of
knocking
at
my
door
knocked
at
that
of
my
secretary
the
latter
immediately
rose
and
opening
the
door
to
his
surprise
saw
the
first
consul
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
a
madras
handkerchief
on
his
head
and
having
on
his
gray
greatcoat
bonaparte
not
knowing
of
the
little
step
down
into
the
room
slipped
and
nearly
fell
where
is
bourrienne
asked
he
the
surprise
of
my
secretary
at
the
apparition
of
the
first
consul
can
be
imagined
what
general
is
it
you
where
is
bourrienne
then
my
secretary
in
his
shirt
showed
the
first
consul
my
door
after
having
told
him
that
he
was
sorry
at
having
called
him
up
napoleon
came
to
me
i
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
we
went
downstairs
to
my
usual
room
we
rang
several
times
before
they
opened
the
door
for
us
the
guards
were
not
asleep
but
having
heard
so
much
running
to
and
fro
feared
we
were
thieves
at
last
they
opened
the
door
and
the
first
consul
threw
on
the
table
the
immense
packet
of
despatches
which
he
had
just
received
they
had
been
fumigated
and
steeped
in
vinegar
when
he
read
the
announcement
of
the
death
of
kleber
the
expression
of
his
countenance
sufficiently
denoted
the
painful
feelings
which
arose
in
his
mind
i
read
in
his
face

this
armistice
was
broken
on
the
of
september
and
renewed
after
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
on
his
return
from
marengo
bonaparte
was
received
with
more
enthusiasm
than
ever
the
rapidity
with
which
in
a
campaign
of
less
than
two
months
he
had
restored
the
triumph
of
the
french
standard
excited
universal
astonishment
he
then
actively
endeavoured
to
open
negotiations
with
england
and
austria
but
difficulties
opposed
him
in
every
direction
he
frequently
visited
the
theatre
where
his
presence
attracted
prodigious
throngs
of
persons
all
eager
to
see
and
applaud
him
the
immense
number
of
letters
which
were
at
this
time
addressed
to
the
first
consul
is
scarcely
conceivable
they
contained
requests
for
places
protestations
of
fidelity
and
in
short
they
were
those
petitionary
circulars
that
are
addressed
to
all
persons
in
power
these
letters
were
often
exceedingly
curious
and
i
have
preserved
many
of
them
among
the
rest
was
one
from
durosel
beaumanoir
an
emigrant
who
had
fled
to
jersey
this
letter
contains
some
interesting
particulars
relative
to
bonaparte
family
it
is
dated
jersey
july
and
the
following
are
the
moat
remarkable
passages
it
contains
i
trust
general
that
i
may
without
indiscretion
intrude
upon
your
notice
to
remind
you
of
what
i
flatter
myself
you
have
not
totally
forgotten
after
having
lived
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
at
ajaccio
but
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
that
so
trifling
an
item
should
be
the
subject
of
the
letter
which
i
have
the
honour
to
address
to
you
you
can
not
have
forgotten
general
that
when
your
late
father
was
obliged
to
take
your
brothers
from
the
college
of
autun
from
whence
he
went
to
see
you
at
brienne
he
was
unprovided
with
mousy
and
he
asked
me
for
louis
which
i
lent
him
with
pleasure
after
his
return
he
had
no
opportunity
of
paying
me
and
when
i
left
ajaccio
your
mother
offered
to
dispose
of
some
plate
in
order
to
pay
the
debt
to
this
i
objected
and
told
her
that
i
would
wait
until
she
could
pay
me
at
her
convenience
and
previous
to
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolution
i
believe
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
fulfil
her
wish
of
discharging
the
debt
i
am
sorry
general
to
be
obliged
to
trouble
yon
about
such
a
trifle
but
such
is
my
unfortunate
situation
that
even
this
trifle
is
of
some
importance
to
me
driven
from
my
country
and
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
this
island
where
everything
is
exceedingly
expensive
the
little
sum
i
have
mentioned
which
was
formerly
a
matter
of
indifference
would
now
be
of
great
service
to
me
you
will
understand
general
that
at
the
age
of
after
serving
served
my
country
well
for
sixty
years
without
the
least
interruption
not
counting
the
time
of
emigration
chased
from
every
place
i
have
been
obliged
to
take
refuge
here
to
subsist
on
the
scanty
succour
given
by
the
english
government
to
the
french
emigrant
i
say
emigrant
because
i
have
been
forced
to
be
one
i
had
no
intention
of
being
one
but
a
horde
of
brigands
who
came
from
caen
to
my
house
to
assassinate
me
considered
i
had
committed
the
great
crime
in
being
the
senior
general
of
the
canton
and
in
having
the
grand
cross
of
louis
this
was
too
much
for
them
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cries
of
my
neighbours
my
door
would
have
been
broken
open
and
i
should
have
been
assassinated
and
i
had
but
time
to
fly
by
a
door
at
the
back
only
carrying
away
what
i
had
on
me
at
first
i
retired
to
paris
but
there
they
told
me
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
go
into
a
foreign
country
so
great
was
the
hate
entertained
for
me
by
my
although
i
lived
in
retirement
never
having
any
discussion
with
any
one
thus
general
i
have
abandoned
all
i
possessed
money
and
goods
leaving
them
at
the
mercy
of
what
they
call
the
nation
which
has
profited
a
good
deal
by
this
as
i
have
nothing
left
in
the
world
not
even
a
spot
to
put
my
foot
on
if
even
a
horse
had
been
reserved
for
me
general
i
could
ask
for
what
depends
on
you
for
i
have
heard
it
said
that
some
emigrants
have
been
allowed
to
return
home
i
do
not
even
ask
this
favour
not
having
a
place
to
rest
my
foot
and
besides
i
have
with
me
here
an
exiled
brother
older
than
i
am
very
ill
and
in
perfect
second
childhood
whom
i
could
not
abandon
i
am
resigned
to
my
own
unhappy
fate
but
my
sole
and
great
grief
is
that
not
only
i
myself
have
been
but
that
my
fate
has
contrary
to
the
law
injured
relations
whom
i
love
and
respect
i
have
a
eighty
years
old
who
has
been
refused
the
dower
i
had
given
her
from
my
property
and
this
will
make
me
die
a
bankrupt
if
nothing
is
changed
which
makes
me
miserable
i
acknowledge
general
that
i
know
little
of
the
new
style
but
according
to
the
old
form
i
am
your
humble
servant
durosel
beaumanoir
i
read
this
letter
to
the
first
consul
who
immediately
said
bourrienne
this
is
sacred
do
not
lose
a
minute
send
the
old
man
ten
times
the
sum
write
to
general
durosel
that
he
shall
be
immediately
erased
from
the
list
of
emigrants
what
mischief
those
brigands
of
the
convention
have
done
i
can
never
repair
it
all
bonaparte
uttered
these
words
with
a
degree
of
emotion
which
i
rarely
saw
him
evince
in
the
evening
he
asked
me
whether
i
had
executed
his
orders
which
i
had
done
without
losing
a
moment
the
death
of
froth
had
given
me
a
lesson
as
to
the
value
of
time
availing
myself
of
the
privilege
i
have
already
frequently
taken
of
making
abrupt
transitions
from
one
subject
to
another
according
as
the
recollection
of
past
circumstances
occurs
to
my
mind
i
shall
here
note
down
a
few
details
which
may
not
improperly
be
called
domestic
and
afterwards
describe
a
conspiracy
which
was
protected
by
the
very
man
against
whom
it
was
hatched
at
the
tuileries
where
the
first
consul
always
resided
during
the
winter
and
sometimes
a
part
of
the
summer
the
grand
salon
was
situated
between
his
cabinet
and
the
room
in
which
he
received
the
persons
with
whom
he
had
appointed
audiences
when
in
this
if
he
wanted
anything
or
had
occasion
to
speak
to
anybody
he
pulled
a
bell
which
was
answered
by
a
confidential
servant
named
landoire
who
was
the
messenger
of
the
first
consul
cabinet
when
bonaparte
bell
rung
it
was
usually
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
inquiry
of
me
respecting
a
paper
a
name
a
date
or
some
matter
of
that
sort
and
then
landoire
had
to
pass
through
the
cabinet
and
salon
to
answer
the
bell
and
afterwards
to
return
and
to
tell
me
i
was
wanted
impatient
at
the
delay
occasioned
by
this
running
about
bonaparte
without
saying
anything
to
me
ordered
the
bell
to
be
altered
so
that
it
should
ring
within
the
cabinet
and
exactly
above
my
table
next
morning
when
i
entered
the
cabinet
i
saw
a
man
a
ladder
what
are
you
doing
here
said
i
i
am
hanging
a
bell
sir
i
called
landoire
and
asked
him
who
had
given
the
order
the
first
consul
he
replied
i
immediately
ordered
the
man
to
come
down
and
remove
the
ladder
which
he
accordingly
did
when
i
went
according
to
custom
to
awaken
the
first
consul
and
read
the
newspapers
to
him
i
said
general
i
found
a
man
this
morning
hanging
a
bell
in
your
cabinet
i
was
told
it
was
by
your
orders
but
being
convinced
there
must
be
some
mistake
i
sent
him
away
surely
the
bell
was
not
intended
for
you
and
i
can
not
imagine
it
was
intended
for
me
who
then
could
it
be
for
what
a
stupid
fellow
that
landoire
is
said
bonaparte
yesterday
when
cambaceres
was
with
me
i
wanted
you
landoire
did
not
come
when
i
touched
the
bell
i
thought
it
was
broken
and
ordered
him
to
get
it
repaired
i
suppose
the
was
doing
it
when
you
saw
him
for
you
know
the
wire
passes
through
the
cabinet
i
was
satisfied
with
this
explanation
though
i
was
not
deceived
by
it
for
the
sake
of
appearance
he
reproved
landoire
who
however
had
done
nothing
more
than
execute
the
order
he
had
received
how
could
he
imagine
i
would
submit
to
such
treatment
considering
that
we
had
been
friends
since
our
boyhood
and
that
i
was
now
living
on
full
terms
of
confidence
and
familiarity
with
him
before
i
speak
of
the
conspiracy
of
ceracchi
arena
and
others
i
must
notice
a
remark
made
by
napoleon
at
helena
he
said
or
is
alleged
to
have
said
the
two
attempts
which
placed
me
in
the
greatest
danger
were
those
of
the
sculptor
ceracchi
and
of
the
fanatic
of
schoenbrun
i
was
not
at
schoenbrun
at
the
time
but
i
am
convinced
that
bonaparte
was
in
the
most
imminent
danger
i
have
been
informed
on
unquestionable
authority
that
staps
set
out
from
erfurth
with
the
intention
of
assassinating
the
emperor
but
he
wanted
the
necessary
courage
for
executing
the
design
he
was
armed
with
a
large
dagger
and
was
twice
sufficiently
near
napoleon
to
have
struck
him
i
heard
this
from
rapp
who
seized
stags
and
felt
the
hilt
of
the
dagger
under
his
coat
on
that
occasion
bonaparte
owed
his
life
only
to
the
irresolution
of
the
young
who
wished
to
sacrifice
him
to
his
fanatical
fury
it
is
equally
certain
that
on
another
occasion
respecting
which
the
author
of
the
helena
narrative
observes
complete
silence
another
fanatic
more
dangerous
than
steps
attempted
the
life
of
napoleon
at
the
time
of
this
attempt
i
was
not
with
napoleon
but
he
directed
me
to
see
the
madmen
who
had
formed
the
design
of
assassinating
him
it
will
be
seen
in
the
coarse
of
these
memoirs
what
were
has
plans
and
what
was
the
result
of
them
bourrienne
the
following
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
facts
relative
to
conspiracy
the
plot
itself
was
a
mere
shadow
but
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
give
it
substance
to
exaggerate
at
least
in
appearance
the
danger
to
which
the
first
consul
had
been
exposed
there
was
at
that
time
in
paris
an
idle
fellow
called
harrel
he
had
been
a
de
battalion
but
he
had
been
dismissed
the
service
and
was
consequently
dissatisfied
he
became
connected
with
cerracchi
arena
and
demerville
from
different
motives
all
these
individuals
were
violently
hostile
to
the
first
consul
who
on
his
part
was
no
friend
to
cerracchi
and
arena
but
scarcely
knew
the
two
others
these
four
individuals
formed
in
conjunction
with
harrel
the
design
of
assassinating
the
first
consul
and
the
time
fixed
for
the
perpetration
of
the
deed
was
one
evening
when
bonaparte
intended
to
visit
the
opera
on
the
of
september
harrel
came
to
me
at
the
tuileries
he
revealed
to
me
the
plot
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
promised
that
his
accomplices
should
be
apprehended
in
the
very
act
if
i
would
supply
him
with
money
to
bring
the
plot
to
maturity
i
knew
not
how
to
act
upon
this
disclosure
which
i
however
could
not
reject
without
incurring
too
great
a
responsibility
i
immediately
communicated
the
business
to
the
first
consul
who
ordered
me
to
supply
harrel
with
money
but
not
to
mention
the
affair
to
fouche
to
whom
he
wished
to
prove
that
he
knew
better
how
to
manage
the
police
than
he
did
harrel
came
nearly
every
evening
at
eleven
to
inform
me
of
the
progress
of
the
conspiracy
which
i
immediately
communicated
to
the
first
consul
who
was
not
sorry
to
find
arena
and
ceracchi
deeply
committed
but
the
time
passed
on
and
nothing
was
done
the
first
consul
began
to
grow
impatient
at
length
harrel
came
to
say
that
they
had
no
money
to
purchase
arms
money
was
given
him
he
however
returned
next
day
to
say
that
the
gunsmith
refused
to
sell
them
arms
without
authority
it
was
now
found
necessary
to
communicate
the
business
to
fouche
in
order
that
he
might
grant
the
necessary
permission
to
the
gunsmith
which
i
was
not
empowered
to
do
on
the
of
october
the
consuls
after
the
breaking
up
of
the
council
assembled
in
the
cabinet
of
their
colleague
bonaparte
asked
them
in
my
presence
whether
they
thought
he
ought
to
go
to
the
opera
they
observed
that
as
every
precaution
was
taken
no
danger
could
be
apprehended
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
show
the
futility
of
attempts
against
the
first
consul
life
after
dinner
bonaparte
put
on
a
greatcoat
over
his
green
uniform
and
got
into
his
carriage
accompanied
by
me
and
duroc
he
seated
himself
in
front
of
his
box
which
at
that
time
was
on
the
left
of
the
theatre
between
the
two
columns
which
separated
the
front
and
side
boxes
when
we
had
been
in
the
theatre
about
half
an
hour
the
first
consul
directed
me
to
go
and
see
what
was
doing
in
the
corridor
scarcely
had
i
left
the
box
than
i
heard
a
great
uproar
and
soon
discovered
that
a
number
of
persons
whose
names
i
could
not
learn
had
been
arrested
i
informed
the
first
consul
of
what
i
had
heard
and
we
immediately
returned
to
the
tuileries
it
is
certain
that
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
take
the
first
consul
life
and
that
the
conspirators
neglected
nothing
which
could
further
the
accomplishment
of
their
atrocious
design
the
plot
however
was
known
through
the
disclosures
of
harrel
and
it
would
have
been
easy
to
avert
instead
of
conjuring
up
the
storm
such
was
and
such
still
is
my
opinion
harrel
name
was
again
restored
to
the
army
list
and
he
was
appointed
commandant
of
vincennes
this
post
he
held
at
the
time
of
the
duc
assassination
i
was
afterwards
told
that
his
wife
was
to
the
unfortunate
prince
and
that
she
recognised
him
when
he
entered
the
prison
which
in
a
few
short
hours
was
to
prove
his
grave
carbonneau
one
of
the
individuals
condemned
candidly
confessed
the
part
he
had
taken
in
the
plot
which
he
said
was
brought
to
maturity
solely
by
the
agents
of
the
police
who
were
always
eager
to
prove
their
zeal
to
their
employers
by
some
new
discovery
although
three
months
intervened
between
the
machinations
of
ceracchi
and
arena
and
the
horrible
attempt
of
the
nivose
i
shall
relate
these
two
events
in
immediate
succession
for
if
they
had
no
other
points
of
resemblance
they
were
at
least
alike
in
their
object
the
conspirators
in
the
first
affair
were
of
the
revolutionary
faction
they
sought
bonaparte
life
as
if
with
the
view
of
rendering
his
resemblance
to
caesar
so
complete
that
not
even
a
brutus
should
be
wanting
the
latter
it
must
with
regret
be
confessed
were
of
the
royalist
party
and
in
their
wish
to
destroy
the
first
consul
they
were
not
deterred
by
the
fear
of
sacrificing
a
great
number
of
citizens
the
police
knew
nothing
of
the
plot
of
the
nivose
for
two
reasons
first
because
they
were
no
parties
to
it
and
secondly
because
two
conspirators
do
not
betray
and
sell
each
other
when
they
are
resolute
in
their
purpose
in
such
cases
the
giving
of
information
can
arise
only
from
two
causes
the
one
excusable
the
other
infamous
viz
the
dread
of
punishment
and
the
hope
of
reward
but
neither
of
these
causes
influenced
the
conspirators
of
the
nivose
the
inventors
and
constructors
of
that
machine
which
has
so
justly
been
denominated
infernal
on
the
nivose
december
the
first
performance
of
magnificent
oratorio
of
the
creation
took
place
at
the
opera
and
the
first
consul
had
expressed
his
intention
of
being
present
i
did
not
dine
with
him
that
day
but
as
he
left
me
he
said
bourrienne
you
know
i
am
going
to
the
opera
and
you
may
go
too
but
i
can
not
take
you
in
the
carriage
as
lannes
berthier
and
lauriston
are
going
with
me
i
was
very
glad
of
this
for
i
much
wished
to
hear
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
the
german
school
of
composition
i
got
to
the
opera
before
bonaparte
who
on
his
entrance
seated
himself
according
to
custom
in
front
of
the
box
the
eye
of
all
present
were
fixed
upon
him
and
he
appeared
to
be
perfectly
calm
and
lauriston
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
came
to
my
box
and
told
me
that
the
first
consul
on
his
way
to
the
opera
had
narrowly
escaped
being
assassinated
in
the
rue
nicaise
by
the
explosion
of
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
the
concussion
of
which
had
shattered
the
windows
of
his
carriage
within
ten
seconds
after
our
escape
added
lauriston
the
coachman
having
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
st
honore
stopped
to
take
the
first
consul
orders
and
he
coolly
said
the
opera
the
following
particulars
respecting
the
affair
of
the
infernal
machine
are
related
by
rapp
who
attended
madame
bonaparte
to
the
opera
he
differs
from
bourrienne
as
to
the
total
ignorance
of
the
police
the
affair
of
the
infernal
machine
has
never
been
property
understood
by
the
public
the
police
had
intimated
to
napoleon
that
an
attempt
would
be
made
against
his
life
and
cautioned
him
not
to
go
out
madame
bonaparte
mademoiselle
beauharnais
madame
murat
lannes
bessieres
the
aide
de
camp
on
duty
lieutenant
lebrun
now
duke
of
placenza
were
all
assembled
in
the
salon
while
the
first
consul
was
writing
in
his
cabinet
haydn
oratorio
was
to
be
performed
that
evening
the
ladies
were
anxious
to
hear
the
music
and
we
also
expressed
a
wish
to
that
effect
the
escort
piquet
was
ordered
out
and
lannes
requested
that
napoleon
would
join
the
party
he
consented
his
carriage
was
ready
and
he
took
along
with
him
bessieres
and
the
aide
de
camp
on
duty
i
was
directed
to
attend
the
ladies
josephine
had
received
a
magnificent
shawl
from
constantinople
and
she
that
evening
wore
it
for
the
first
time
me
to
observe
said
i
your
shawl
is
not
thrown
on
with
your
usual
elegance
she
begged
that
i
would
fold
it
after
the
fashion
of
the
egyptian
ladies
while
i
was
engaged
in
this
operation
we
heard
napoleon
depart
sister
said
madame
murat
who
was
impatient
to
get
to
the
theatre
is
going
we
stopped
into
the
carriage
the
first
consul
equipage
had
already
reached
the
middle
of
the
place
du
carrousel
we
drove
after
it
but
we
had
scarcely
entered
the
place
when
the
machine
exploded
napoleon
escaped
by
a
singular
chance
regent
or
his
servant
francois
had
stationed
himself
in
the
middle
of
tho
rue
nicaise
a
grenadier
of
the
escort
supposing
he
was
really
what
he
appeared
to
be
a
gave
him
a
few
blows
with
the
flat
of
his
sabre
and
drove
him
off
the
cart
was
turned
round
and
the
machine
exploded
between
the
carriages
of
napoleon
and
josephine
the
ladies
shrieked
on
hearing
the
report
the
carriage
windows
were
broken
and
mademoiselle
beauharnais
received
a
slight
hurt
on
her
hand
i
alighted
and
crossed
the
rue
nicaise
which
was
strewed
with
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
been
thrown
down
and
the
fragments
of
the
walls
that
had
been
shattered
with
the
explosion
neither
the
consul
nor
any
individual
of
his
suite
sustained
any
serious
injury
when
i
entered
the
theatre
napoleon
was
seated
in
his
box
calm
and
composed
and
looking
at
the
audience
through
his
fouche
was
beside
him
said
he
as
soon
as
he
observed
me
she
entered
at
that
instant
and
he
did
not
finish
his
question
rascals
said
he
very
cooly
wanted
to
blow
me
up
bring
me
a
book
of
the
oratorio
memoirs
of
general
count
rape
on
hearing
this
i
left
the
theatre
and
returned
to
the
palace
under
the
expectation
that
i
should
speedily
be
wanted
bonaparte
soon
returned
home
and
as
intelligence
of
the
affair
had
spread
through
paris
the
grand
salon
on
the
was
filled
with
a
crowd
of
functionaries
eager
to
read
in
the
eye
of
their
master
what
they
were
to
think
and
say
on
the
occasion
he
did
not
keep
them
long
in
suspense
this
exclaimed
he
vehemently
is
the
work
of
the
jacobins
they
have
attempted
my
life
there
are
neither
nobles
priests
nor
chouans
in
this
affair
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
they
need
not
think
to
impose
on
me
these
are
the
septembrizers
who
have
been
in
open
revolt
and
conspiracy
and
arrayed
against
every
succeeding
government
it
is
scarce
three
months
since
my
life
was
attempted
by
uracchi
arena
and
demerville
they
all
belong
to
one
gang
the
cutthroats
of
september
the
assassins
of
versailles
the
brigands
of
the
of
may
the
conspirators
of
prairial
are
the
authors
of
all
the
crimes
committed
against
established
governments
if
they
can
not
be
checked
they
must
be
crashed
france
must
be
purged
of
these
ruffians
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
idea
of
the
bitterness
with
which
bonaparte
pronounced
these
words
in
vain
did
some
of
the
councillors
of
state
and
fouche
in
particular
endeavour
to
point
out
to
him
that
there
was
no
evidence
against
any
one
and
that
before
he
pronounced
people
to
be
guilty
it
would
be
right
to
ascertain
the
fact
bonaparte
repeated
with
increased
violence
what
he
had
before
said
of
the
jacobins
thus
adding
not
without
some
ground
of
suspicion
one
crime
more
to
the
long
catalogue
for
which
they
had
already
to
answer
fouche
had
many
enemies
and
i
was
not
therefore
surprised
to
find
some
of
the
ministers
endeavouring
to
take
advantage
of
the
difference
between
his
opinion
and
that
of
the
first
consul
and
it
must
be
owned
that
the
utter
ignorance
of
the
police
respecting
this
event
was
a
circumstance
not
very
favourable
to
fouche
he
however
was
like
the
reed
in
the
fable
he
bent
with
the
wind
but
was
soon
erect
again
the
most
skilful
actor
could
scarcely
imitate
the
inflexible
calmness
he
maintained
during
bonaparte
paroxysm
of
rage
and
the
patience
with
which
he
allowed
himself
to
be
accused
fouche
when
afterwards
conversing
with
me
gave
me
clearly
to
understand
that
he
did
not
think
the
jacobins
guilty
i
mentioned
this
to
the
first
consul
but
nothing
could
make
him
retract
his
opinion
fouche
said
he
has
good
reason
for
his
silence
he
is
serving
his
own
party
it
is
very
natural
that
he
should
seek
to
screen
a
set
of
men
who
are
polluted
with
blood
and
crimes
he
was
one
of
their
leaders
do
not
i
know
what
he
did
at
lyons
and
the
loire
that
explains
fouche
conduct
now
this
is
the
exact
truth
and
now
let
me
contradict
one
of
the
thousand
fictions
about
this
event
it
has
been
said
and
printed
that
the
dignitaries
and
the
ministers
were
assembled
at
the
tuileries
said
the
first
consul
advancing
angrily
towards
fouche
you
still
say
that
this
is
the
royalist
party
fouche
better
informed
than
was
believed
answered
coolly
certainly
i
shall
say
so
and
what
is
more
i
shall
prove
it
this
speech
caused
general
astonishment
but
was
afterwards
fully
borne
out
this
is
pure
invention
the
first
consul
only
said
to
fouche
i
do
not
trust
to
your
police
i
guard
myself
and
i
watch
till
two
in
the
morning
this
however
was
very
rarely
the
case
on
the
day
after
the
explosion
of
the
infernal
machine
a
considerable
concourse
assembled
at
the
tuileries
there
was
absolutely
a
torrent
of
congratulations
the
prefect
of
the
seine
convoked
the
twelve
mayors
of
paris
and
came
at
their
head
to
wait
on
the
first
consul
in
his
reply
to
their
address
bonaparte
said
as
long
as
this
gang
of
assassins
confined
their
attacks
to
me
personally
i
left
the
law
to
take
its
course
but
since
by
an
unparalleled
crime
they
have
endangered
the
lives
of
a
portion
of
the
population
of
paris
their
punishment
must
be
as
prompt
as
exemplary
a
hundred
of
these
wretches
who
have
libeled
liberty
by
perpetrating
crimes
in
her
name
must
be
effectually
prevented
from
renewing
their
atrocities
he
then
conversed
with
the
ministers
the
councillors
of
state
on
the
event
of
the
preceding
day
and
as
all
knew
the
first
consul
opinion
of
the
authors
of
the
crime
each
was
eager
to
confirm
it
the
council
was
several
times
assembled
when
the
senate
was
consulted
and
the
adroit
fouche
whose
conscience
yielded
to
the
delicacy
of
his
situation
addressed
to
the
first
consul
a
report
worthy
of
a
mazarin
at
the
same
time
the
journals
were
filled
with
recollections
of
the
revolution
raked
up
for
the
purpose
of
connecting
with
past
crimes
the
individuals
on
whom
it
was
now
wished
to
cast
odium
it
was
decreed
that
a
hundred
persons
should
be
banished
and
the
senate
established
its
character
for
complaisance
by
passing
a
consulte
conformable
to
the
wishes
of
the
first
consul
a
list
was
drawn
up
of
the
persons
styled
jacobins
who
were
condemned
to
transportation
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
the
erasure
of
the
names
of
several
whose
opinions
had
perhaps
been
violent
but
whose
education
and
private
character
presented
claims
to
recommendation
some
of
my
readers
may
probably
recollect
them
without
my
naming
them
and
i
shall
only
mention
tissot
for
the
purpose
of
recording
not
the
service
i
rendered
him
but
an
instance
of
grateful
acknowledgment
when
in
napoleon
was
on
the
point
of
entering
paris
tissot
came
to
the
prefecture
of
police
where
i
then
was
and
offered
me
his
house
as
a
safe
asylum
assuring
me
i
should
there
run
no
risk
of
being
discovered
though
i
did
not
accept
the
offer
yet
i
gladly
seize
on
this
opportunity
of
making
it
known
it
is
gratifying
to
find
that
difference
of
political
opinion
does
not
always
exclude
sentiments
of
generosity
and
honour
i
shall
never
forget
the
way
in
which
the
author
of
the
essays
on
virgil
uttered
the
words
mea
but
to
return
to
the
fatal
list
even
while
i
write
this
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
way
in
which
men
utterly
innocent
were
accused
of
a
revolting
crime
without
even
the
shadow
of
a
proof
the
name
of
an
individual
his
opinions
perhaps
only
assumed
were
sufficient
grounds
for
his
banishment
a
decree
of
the
consuls
dated
of
january
confirmed
by
a
on
the
next
day
banished
from
the
territory
of
the
republic
and
placed
under
special
inspectors
individuals
nine
of
whom
were
merely
designated
in
the
report
as
septembrizers
the
exiles
who
in
the
reports
and
in
the
public
acts
were
so
unjustly
accused
of
being
the
authors
of
the
infernal
machine
were
received
at
nantes
with
so
much
indignation
that
the
military
were
compelled
to
interfere
to
save
them
from
being
massacred
in
the
discussions
which
preceded
the
decree
of
the
consuls
few
persons
had
the
courage
to
express
a
doubt
respecting
the
guilt
of
the
accused
truguet
was
the
first
to
mount
the
breach
he
observed
that
without
denying
the
government
the
extraordinary
means
for
getting
rid
of
its
enemies
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
the
emigrants
threatened
the
purchasers
of
national
domains
that
the
public
mind
was
corrupted
by
pamphlets
and
that
here
the
first
consul
interrupting
him
exclaimed
to
what
pamphlets
do
you
allude
to
pamphlets
which
are
publicly
circulated
name
them
you
know
them
as
well
as
i
do
the
parallel
between
caesar
cromwell
and
bonaparte
of
which
i
shall
speak
a
little
farther
on
is
here
alluded
bourrienne
after
a
long
and
angry
ebullition
the
first
consul
abruptly
dismissed
the
council
he
observed
that
he
would
not
be
duped
that
the
villains
were
known
that
they
were
septembrizers
the
hatchers
of
every
mischief
he
had
said
at
a
sitting
three
days
before
if
proof
should
fail
we
must
take
advantage
of
the
public
excitement
the
event
is
to
me
merely
the
opportunity
they
shall
be
banished
for
the
september
for
the
may
for
baboeuf
conspiracy
or
anything
else
on
leaving
one
of
the
sittings
of
the
council
at
which
the
question
of
a
special
tribunal
had
been
discussed
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
a
little
ruffled
that
he
had
said
a
violent
blow
must
be
struck
that
blood
must
be
spilt
and
that
as
many
of
the
guilty
should
be
shot
as
there
had
been
victims
of
the
explosion
from
fifteen
to
twenty
that
should
be
banished
and
the
republic
purged
of
these
scoundrels
the
arbitrariness
and
illegality
of
the
proceeding
were
so
evident
that
the
contained
no
mention
of
the
transactions
of
the
nivose
which
was
very
remarkable
it
was
however
declared
that
the
measure
of
the
previous
day
had
been
adopted
with
a
view
to
the
preservation
of
the
constitution
this
was
promising
the
first
consul
manifested
the
most
violent
hatred
of
the
jacobins
for
this
he
could
not
have
been
blamed
if
under
the
title
of
jacobins
he
had
not
comprised
every
devoted
advocate
of
public
liberty
their
opposition
annoyed
him
and
he
could
never
pardon
them
for
having
presumed
to
condemn
his
tyrannical
acts
and
to
resist
the
destruction
of
the
freedom
which
he
had
himself
sworn
to
defend
but
which
he
was
incessantly
labouring
to
overturn
these
were
the
true
motives
of
his
conduct
and
conscious
of
his
own
faults
he
regarded
with
dislike
those
who
saw
and
disapproved
of
them
for
this
reason
he
was
more
afraid
of
those
whom
he
called
jacobins
than
of
the
royalists
i
am
here
recording
the
faults
of
bonaparte
but
i
excuse
him
situated
as
he
was
any
other
person
would
have
acted
in
the
same
way
truth
now
reached
him
with
difficulty
and
when
it
was
not
agreeable
he
had
no
disposition
to
hear
it
he
was
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
the
greater
number
of
those
who
approached
him
far
from
telling
him
what
they
really
thought
only
repeated
what
he
had
himself
been
thinking
hence
he
admired
the
wisdom
of
his
counsellors
thus
fouche
to
maintain
himself
in
favour
was
obliged
to
deliver
up
to
his
master
names
chosen
from
among
his
own
most
intimate
friends
as
objects
of
proscription
meanwhile
fouche
still
believing
that
he
was
not
deceived
as
to
the
real
authors
of
the
attempt
of
the
nivose
set
in
motion
with
his
usual
dexterity
all
the
springs
of
the
police
his
efforts
however
were
for
sometime
unsuccessful
but
at
length
on
saturday
the
january
about
two
hours
after
our
arrival
at
malmaison
fouche
presented
himself
and
produced
authentic
proofs
of
the
accuracy
of
his
conjectures
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
on
the
subject
and
bonaparte
saw
clearly
that
the
attempt
of
the
nivose
was
the
result
of
a
plot
hatched
by
the
partisans
of
royalty
but
as
the
act
of
proscription
against
those
who
were
jumbled
together
under
the
title
of
the
jacobins
had
been
executed
it
was
not
to
be
revoked
thus
the
consequence
of
the
nivose
was
that
both
the
innocent
and
guilty
were
punished
with
this
difference
however
that
the
guilty
at
least
had
the
benefit
of
a
trial
when
the
jacobins
as
they
were
called
were
accused
with
such
precipitation
fouche
had
no
positive
proofs
of
their
innocence
and
therefore
their
illegal
condemnation
ought
not
to
be
attributed
to
him
sufficient
odium
is
attached
to
his
memory
without
his
being
charged
with
a
crime
he
never
committed
still
i
must
say
that
had
he
boldly
opposed
the
opinion
of
bonaparte
in
the
first
burst
of
his
fury
he
might
have
averted
the
blow
every
time
he
came
to
the
tuileries
even
before
he
had
acquired
any
traces
of
the
truth
fouche
always
declared
to
me
his
conviction
of
the
innocence
of
the
persons
first
accused
but
he
was
afraid
to
make
the
same
observation
to
bonaparte
i
often
mentioned
to
him
the
opinion
of
the
minister
of
police
but
as
proof
was
wanting
he
replied
to
me
with
a
triumphant
air
bah
bah
this
is
always
the
way
with
fouche
besides
it
is
of
little
consequence
at
any
rate
we
shall
get
rid
of
them
should
the
guilty
be
discovered
among
the
royalists
they
also
shall
be
punished
the
real
criminals
being
at
length
discovered
through
the
researches
of
fouche
regent
and
carbon
expiated
their
crimes
by
the
forfeit
of
their
heads
thus
the
first
consul
gained
his
point
and
justice
gained
hers
it
was
regent
or
rejeant
who
fired
the
infernal
machine
the
violence
of
the
shock
flung
him
against
a
post
and
part
of
his
breast
bone
was
driven
in
he
was
obliged
to
resort
to
a
surgeon
and
it
would
seem
that
this
man
denounced
him
memoirs
of
miot
de
melito
tome
the
discussions
which
took
place
in
the
council
of
state
on
this
affair
are
remarkable
both
for
the
violence
of
napoleon
and
for
the
resistance
made
in
the
council
to
a
great
extent
successfully
to
his
views
as
to
the
plot
being
one
of
the
jacobin
party
i
have
often
had
occasion
to
notice
the
multifarious
means
employed
by
bonaparte
to
arrive
at
the
possession
of
supreme
power
and
to
prepare
men
minds
for
so
great
change
those
who
have
observed
his
life
must
have
so
remarked
how
entirely
he
was
convinced
of
the
truth
that
public
opinion
wastes
itself
on
the
rumour
of
a
project
and
possesses
no
energy
at
the
moment
of
its
execution
in
order
therefore
to
direct
public
attention
to
the
question
of
hereditary
power
a
pamphlet
was
circulated
about
paris
and
the
following
is
the
history
of
it
in
the
month
of
december
while
fouche
was
searching
after
the
real
authors
of
the
attempt
of
the
nivose
a
small
pamphlet
entitled
parallel
between
caesar
cromwell
anal
bonaparte
was
sent
to
the
first
consul
he
was
absent
when
it
came
i
read
it
and
perceived
that
it
openly
advocated
hereditary
monarchy
i
then
knew
nothing
about
the
origin
of
this
pamphlet
but
i
soon
learned
that
it
issued
from
the
office
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
lucien
bonaparte
and
that
it
had
been
largely
circulated
after
reading
it
i
laid
it
on
the
table
in
a
few
minutes
bonaparte
entered
and
taking
up
the
pamphlet
pretended
to
look
through
it
have
you
read
this
said
yes
general
well
what
is
your
opinion
of
it
i
think
it
is
calculated
to
produce
an
unfavourable
effect
on
the
public
mind
it
is
for
it
prematurely
reveals
your
views
the
first
consul
took
the
pamphlet
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
as
he
did
all
the
stupid
publications
of
the
day
after
having
slightly
glanced
over
them
i
was
not
singular
in
my
opinion
of
the
pamphlet
for
next
day
the
prefects
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
paris
sent
a
copy
of
it
to
the
first
consul
complaining
of
its
mischievous
effect
and
i
recollect
that
in
one
of
their
letters
it
was
stated
that
such
a
work
was
calculated
to
direct
against
him
the
poniards
of
new
assassins
after
reading
this
correspondence
he
said
to
me
bourrienne
sent
for
fouche
he
must
come
directly
and
give
an
account
of
this
matter
in
half
an
hour
fouche
was
in
the
first
consul
cabinet
no
sooner
had
he
entered
than
the
following
dialogue
took
place
in
which
the
impetuous
warmth
of
the
one
party
was
strangely
contrasted
with
the
phlegmatic
and
rather
sardonic
composure
of
the
other
what
pamphlet
is
this
what
is
said
about
it
in
paris
general
there
is
but
one
opinion
of
its
dangerous
tendency
well
then
why
did
you
allow
it
to
appear
general
i
was
obliged
to
show
some
consideration
for
the
author
consideration
for
the
author
what
do
you
mean
you
should
have
sent
him
to
the
temple
but
general
your
brother
lucien
patronises
this
pamphlet
it
has
been
printed
and
published
by
his
order
in
short
it
comes
from
the
office
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
no
matter
for
that
your
duty
as
minister
of
police
was
to
have
arrested
lucien
and
sent
him
to
the
temple
the
fool
does
nothing
but
contrive
how
he
can
commit
me
with
these
words
the
first
consul
left
the
cabinet
shutting
the
door
violently
behind
him
being
now
alone
with
fouche
i
was
eager
to
get
an
explanation
of
the
suppressed
smile
which
had
more
than
once
curled
his
lips
during
bonaparte
angry
expostulation
i
easily
perceived
that
there
was
something
in
reserve
send
the
author
to
the
temple
said
fouche
that
would
be
no
easy
matter
alarmed
at
the
effect
which
this
parallel
between
caesar
cromwell
and
bonaparte
was
likely
to
produce
i
went
to
lucien
to
point
out
to
him
his
imprudence
he
made
me
no
answer
but
went
and
got
a
manuscript
which
he
showed
me
and
which
contained
corrections
and
annotations
in
the
first
consul
handwriting
when
lucien
heard
how
bonaparte
had
expressed
his
displeasure
at
the
pamphlet
he
also
came
to
the
tuileries
to
reproach
his
brother
with
having
thrust
him
forward
and
then
abandoned
him
is
your
own
fault
said
the
first
consul
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
be
caught
so
much
the
worse
for
you
fouche
is
too
cunning
for
you
you
are
a
mere
fool
compared
with
him
lucien
tendered
his
resignation
which
was
accepted
and
he
departed
for
spain
this
diplomatic
mission
turned
to
his
advantage
it
was
necessary
that
one
should
veil
the
machiavellian
invention
of
the
the
has
been
attributed
to
different
writers
some
phrases
seemed
the
work
of
lucien
but
says
thiers
tome
ii
its
rare
elegance
of
language
and
its
classical
knowledge
of
history
should
attribute
it
to
its
real
anchor
fontanel
joseph
bonaparte
erreurs
tome
says
that
fontanel
wrote
it
and
lucien
bonaparte
corrected
it
see
meneval
tome
iii
whoever
wrote
it
napoleon
certainly
planned
its
it
was
said
he
to
roederer
a
work
of
which
he
himself
had
given
the
idea
but
the
last
pages
were
by
a
fool
miot
tome
i
see
also
lanfrey
tome
ii
and
compare
the
story
in
iung
lucien
tome
ii
miot
then
in
the
confidence
of
joseph
says
that
lucien
removal
from
office
was
the
result
of
an
angry
quarrel
between
him
and
fouche
in
the
presence
of
napoleon
when
fouche
attacked
lucien
not
only
for
the
pamphlet
but
also
for
the
disorder
of
his
public
and
his
private
life
but
miot
tome
i
p
places
the
date
of
this
as
the
november
while
bourrienne
dates
the
disapproval
of
the
pamphlet
in
december
lucien
among
other
instructions
was
directed
to
use
all
his
endeavours
to
induce
spain
to
declare
against
portugal
in
order
to
compel
that
power
to
separate
herself
from
england
the
first
consul
had
always
regarded
portugal
as
an
english
colony
and
he
conceived
that
to
attack
it
was
to
assail
england
he
wished
that
portugal
should
no
longer
favour
england
in
her
commercial
relations
but
that
like
spain
she
should
become
dependent
on
him
lucien
was
therefore
sent
as
ambassador
to
madrid
to
second
the
ministers
of
charles
iv
in
prevailing
on
the
king
to
invade
portugal
the
king
declared
war
but
it
was
not
of
long
duration
and
terminated
almost
without
a
blow
being
struck
by
the
taking
of
olivenza
on
the
of
june
portugal
signed
the
treaty
of
badajoz
by
which
she
promised
to
cede
olivenza
almeida
and
some
other
fortresses
to
spain
and
to
close
her
ports
against
england
the
first
consul
who
was
dissatisfied
with
the
treaty
at
first
refused
to
ratify
it
he
still
kept
his
army
in
spain
and
this
proceeding
determined
portugal
to
accede
to
some
slight
alterations
in
the
first
treaty
this
business
proved
very
advantageous
to
lucien
and
godoy
the
cabinet
of
the
tuileries
was
not
the
only
place
in
which
the
question
of
hereditary
succession
was
discussed
it
was
the
constant
subject
of
conversation
in
the
salons
of
paris
where
a
new
dynasty
was
already
spoken
of
this
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
the
first
consul
but
he
saw
clearly
that
he
had
committed
a
mistake
in
agitating
the
question
prematurely
for
this
reason
he
waged
war
against
the
parallel
as
he
would
not
be
suspected
of
having
had
any
share
in
a
design
that
had
failed
one
day
he
said
to
me
i
believe
i
have
been
a
little
too
precipitate
the
pear
is
not
quite
ripe
the
consulate
for
life
was
accordingly
postponed
till
and
the
hereditary
empire
till
after
the
failure
of
the
artful
publication
of
the
pamphlet
fouche
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
as
the
first
consul
wished
me
to
dine
out
as
seldom
as
possible
i
informed
him
of
the
invitation
i
had
received
he
was
however
aware
of
it
before
and
he
very
readily
gave
me
leave
to
go
at
dinner
joseph
was
placed
on
the
right
of
fouche
and
i
next
to
joseph
who
talked
of
nothing
but
his
brother
his
designs
the
pamphlet
and
the
bad
effect
produced
by
it
in
all
that
fell
from
him
there
was
a
tone
of
blame
and
disapproval
i
told
him
my
opinion
but
with
greater
reserve
than
i
had
used
towards
his
brother
he
seemed
to
approve
of
what
i
said
his
confidence
encouraged
me
and
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
he
entertained
sentiments
entirely
similar
to
my
own
his
unreserved
manner
so
imposed
upon
me
that
notwithstanding
the
experience
i
had
acquired
i
was
far
from
suspecting
myself
to
be
in
the
company
of
a
spy
next
day
the
first
consul
said
to
me
very
coldly
leave
my
letters
in
the
basket
i
will
open
them
myself
this
unexpected
direction
surprised
me
exceedingly
and
i
determined
to
play
him
a
trick
in
revenge
for
his
unfounded
distrust
for
three
mornings
i
laid
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
all
the
letters
which
i
knew
came
from
the
ministers
and
all
the
reports
which
were
addressed
to
me
for
the
first
consul
i
then
covered
them
over
with
those
which
judging
from
their
envelopes
and
seals
appeared
to
be
of
that
trifling
kind
with
which
the
first
consul
was
daily
overwhelmed
these
usually
consisted
of
requests
that
he
would
name
the
number
of
a
lottery
ticket
so
that
the
writer
might
have
the
benefit
of
his
good
luck
solicitations
that
he
would
stand
godfather
to
a
child
petitions
for
places
announcements
of
marriages
and
births
absurd
eulogies
etc
unaccustomed
to
open
the
letters
he
became
impatient
at
their
number
and
he
opened
very
few
often
on
the
same
day
but
always
on
the
morrow
came
a
fresh
letter
from
a
minister
who
asked
for
an
answer
to
his
former
one
and
who
complained
of
not
having
received
one
the
first
consul
unsealed
some
twenty
letters
and
left
the
rest
the
opening
of
all
these
letters
which
he
was
not
at
other
times
in
the
habit
of
looking
at
annoyed
him
extremely
but
as
i
neither
wished
to
carry
the
joke
too
far
nor
to
remain
in
the
disagreeable
position
in
which
joseph
treachery
had
placed
me
i
determined
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
conclusion
after
the
third
day
when
the
business
of
the
night
which
had
been
interrupted
by
little
fits
of
was
concluded
bonaparte
retired
to
bed
half
an
hour
after
i
went
to
his
chamber
to
which
i
was
admitted
at
all
hours
i
had
a
candle
in
my
hand
and
taking
a
chair
i
sat
down
on
the
right
side
of
the
bed
and
placed
the
candle
on
the
table
both
he
and
josephine
awoke
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
with
surprise
general
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
can
no
longer
remain
here
since
i
have
lost
your
confidence
you
know
how
sincerely
i
am
devoted
to
you
if
you
have
then
anything
to
reproach
me
with
let
me
at
least
know
it
for
my
situation
during
the
last
three
days
lies
been
very
painful
what
has
bourrienne
done
inquired
josephine
earnestly
that
does
not
concern
you
he
replied
then
turning
to
me
he
said
tis
true
i
have
cause
to
complain
of
you
i
have
been
informed
that
you
have
spoken
of
important
affairs
in
a
very
indiscreet
manner
i
can
assure
you
that
i
spoke
to
none
but
your
brother
it
was
he
who
led
me
into
the
conversation
and
he
was
too
well
versed
in
the
business
for
me
to
tell
him
any
secret
he
may
have
reported
to
you
what
he
pleased
but
could
not
i
do
the
same
by
him
i
could
accuse
and
betray
him
as
he
has
accused
and
betrayed
me
when
i
spoke
in
confidence
to
your
brother
could
i
regard
him
as
an
inquisitor
i
must
confess
replied
bonaparte
that
after
what
i
heard
from
joseph
i
thought
it
right
to
put
my
confidence
in
quarantine
the
quarantine
has
lasted
three
days
general
surely
that
is
long
enough
well
bourrienne
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
open
my
letters
as
usual
you
will
find
the
answers
a
good
deal
in
arrear
which
has
much
vexed
me
and
besides
i
was
always
stumbling
on
some
stupid
nonsense
or
other
i
fancy
i
still
see
and
hear
the
amiable
josephine
sitting
up
in
bed
and
saying
in
her
gentle
way
what
bonaparte
is
it
possible
you
could
suspect
bourrienne
who
is
so
attached
to
you
and
who
is
your
only
friend
how
could
you
suffer
such
a
snare
to
be
laid
for
him
what
a
dinner
got
up
on
purpose
how
i
hate
these
odious
police
manoeuvres
go
to
sleep
said
bonaparte
let
women
mind
their
gewgaws
and
not
interfere
with
politics
it
was
near
two
in
the
morning
before
i
retired
when
after
a
few
hours
sleep
i
again
saw
the
first
consul
he
was
more
kind
to
me
than
ever
and
i
perceived
that
for
the
present
every
cloud
had
dispersed
joseph
bonaparte
erreurs
tome
says
what
he
reported
to
his
brother
was
bourrienne
conversation
to
him
in
the
first
consul
cabinet
during
napoleon
absence
it
is
curious
that
at
the
only
time
when
napoleon
became
dissatisfied
with
meneval
bourrienne
successor
and
ordered
him
not
to
open
the
letters
he
used
the
same
expression
when
returning
to
the
usual
order
of
business
which
in
this
case
was
to
a
few
hours
my
dear
meneval
said
he
there
are
circumstances
in
which
i
am
forced
to
put
my
confidence
in
quarantine
meneval
tome
for
any
one
who
has
had
to
manage
an
office
it
is
pleasant
to
find
that
even
napoleon
was
much
dependent
on
a
good
secretary
in
an
illness
of
his
secretary
he
said

poets
this
unexpected
proceeding
the
result
of

justly
incensed
the
first
consul
who
had
given
decided
proofs
of
moderation
and
a
wish
for
peace
i
want
peace
said
he
to
me
to
enable
me
to
organise
the
interior
the
people
also
want
it
you
see
the
conditions
i
offer
austria
though
beaten
obtains
all
she
got
at
what
can
she
want
more
i
could
make
further
exactions
but
without
fearing
the
reverses
of
i
must
think
of
the
future
besides
i
want
tranquillity
to
enable
me
to
settle
the
affairs
of
the
interior
and
to
send
aid
to
malta
and
egypt
but
i
will
not
be
trifled
with
i
will
force
an
immediate
decision
in
his
irritation
the
first
consul
despatched
orders
to
moreau
directing
him
to
break
the
armistice
and
resume
hostilities
unless
he
regained
possession
of
the
bridges
of
the
rhine
and
the
danube
by
the
surrender
of
philipsburg
ulm
and
ingolstadt
the
austrians
then
offered
to
treat
with
france
on
new
bases
england
wished
to
take
part
in
the
congress
but
to
this
the
first
consul
would
not
consent
until
she
should
sign
a
separate
armistice
and
cease
to
make
common
cause
with
austria
the
first
consul
received
intelligence
of
the
occupation
of
the
three
garrisons
on
the
of
september
the
day
he
had
fixed
in
his
ultimatum
to
england
for
the
renewal
of
hostilities
but
for
the
meanwhile
he
was
satisfied
with
the
concessions
of
austria
that
power
in
the
expectation
of
being
supported
by
england
asked
her
on
what
terms
she
was
to
treat
during
these
communications
with
austria
otto
was
in
london
negotiating
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
england
would
not
hear
of
an
armistice
by
sea
like
that
which
france
had
concluded
with
austria
by
land
she
alleged
that
in
case
of
a
rupture
france
would
derive
from
that
armistice
greater
advantage
than
austria
would
gain
by
that
already
concluded
the
difficulty
and
delay
attending
the
necessary
communications
rendered
these
reasons
plausible
the
first
consul
consented
to
accept
other
propositions
from
england
and
to
allow
her
to
take
part
in
the
discussions
of
luneville
but
on
condition
that
she
should
sign
a
treaty
with
him
without
the
intervention
of
austria
this
england
refused
to
do
weary
of
this
uncertainty
and
the
tergiversation
of
austria
which
was
still
under
the
influence
of
england
and
feeling
that
the
prolongation
of
such
a
state
of
things
could
only
turn
to
his
disadvantage
bonaparte
broke
the
armistice
he
had
already
consented
to
sacrifices
which
his
successes
in
italy
did
not
justify
the
hope
of
an
immediate
peace
had
alone
made
him
lose
sight
of
the
immense
advantages
which
victory
had
given
him
far
from
appearing
sensible
to
the
many
proofs
of
moderation
which
the
first
consul
evinced
the
combined
insolence
of
england
and
austria
seemed
only
to
increase
orders
were
immediately
given
for
resuming
the
offensive
in
germany
and
italy
and
hostilities
then
recommenced
the
chances
of
fortune
were
long
doubtful
after
a
reverse
austria
made
promises
and
after
an
advantage
she
evaded
them
but
finally
fortune
proved
favourable
to
france
the
french
armies
in
italy
and
germany
crossed
the
mincio
and
the
danube
and
the
celebrated
battle
of
hohenlinden
brought
the
french
advanced
posts
within
ten
leagues
of
vienna
this
victory
secured
peace
for
profiting
by
past
experience
the
first
consul
would
not
hear
of
any
suspension
of
arms
until
austria
should
consent
to
a
separate
treaty
driven
into
her
last
intrenchments
austria
was
obliged
to
yield
she
abandoned
england
and
the
english
cabinet
in
spite
of
the
subsidy
of
sterling
consented
to
the
separation
great
britain
was
forced
to
come
to
this
arrangement
in
consequence
of
the
situation
to
which
the
successes
of
the
army
of
moreau
had
reduced
austria
which
it
was
certain
would
be
ruined
by
longer
resistance
england
wished
to
enter
into
negotiations
at
luneville
to
this
the
first
consul
acceded
but
as
he
saw
that
england
was
seeking
to
deceive
him
he
required
that
she
should
suspend
hostilities
with
france
as
austria
had
done
bonaparte
very
reasonably
alleged
that
an
indefinite
armistice
on
the
continent
would
be
more
to
the
disadvantage
of
france
than
a
long
armistice
by
sea
would
be
unfavourable
to
england
all
this
adjourned
the
preliminaries
to
and
the
peace
to
the
impatience
and
indignation
of
the
first
consul
had
been
highly
excited
by
the
evasions
of
austria
and
the
plots
of
england
for
he
knew
all
the
intrigues
that
were
carrying
on
for
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
his
joy
may
be
therefore
conceived
when
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
balanced
the
scale
of
fortune
in
his
favour
on
the
of
december
moreau
gained
that
memorable
victory
which
at
length
put
an
end
to
the
hesitations
of
the
cabinet
of
vienna
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
moreau
was
at
supper
with
his
aides
de
camp
and
several
general
officers
when
a
despatch
was
delivered
to
him
after
he
had
read
it
be
said
to
his
guests
though
he
was
far
from
being
in
the
habit
of
boasting
i
am
here
made
acquainted
with
baron
kray
movements
they
are
all
i
could
wish
we
will
take
from
him
prisoners
moreau
took
besides
a
great
many
bourrienne
on
the
of
december
the
first
consul
received
intelligence
of
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
it
was
on
a
saturday
and
he
had
just
returned
from
the
theatre
when
i
delivered
the
despatches
to
him
he
literally
danced
for
joy
i
must
say
that
he
did
not
expect
so
important
a
result
from
the
movements
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
this
victory
gave
a
new
face
to
his
negotiations
for
peace
and
determined
the
opening
of
the
congress
of
luneville
which
took
place
on
the
of
january
following
on
receiving
information
of
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
madame
moreau
came
to
the
tuileries
to
call
on
the
first
consul
and
madame
bonaparte
she
did
not
see
them
and
repeated
her
calls
several
times
with
no
better
success
the
last
time
she
came
she
was
accompanied
by
her
mother
madame
hulot
she
waited
for
a
considerable
time
in
vain
and
when
she
was
going
away
her
mother
who
could
no
longer
restrain
her
feelings
said
aloud
before
me
and
several
persons
of
the
household
that
it
ill
became
the
wife
of
the
conqueror
of
hohenlinden
to
dance
attendance
in
this
way
this
remark
reached
the
ears
of
those
to
whom
it
was
directed
madame
moreau
shortly
after
rejoined
her
husband
in
germany
and
some
time
after
her
departure
madame
hulot
came
to
malmaison
to
solicit
promotion
for
her
eldest
son
who
was
in
the
navy
josephine
received
madame
hulot
very
kindly
and
requested
her
to
stay
to
dinner
she
accepted
the
invitation
the
first
consul
who
did
not
see
her
until
the
hour
of
dinner
treated
her
very
coolly
he
said
little
to
her
and
retired
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
his
rudeness
was
so
marked
and
offensive
that
josephine
who
was
always
kind
and
amiable
thought
it
necessary
to
apologise
by
observing
that
his
mind
was
disturbed
by
the
of
a
courier
whom
he
expected
bonaparte
entertained
no
dislike
of
moreau
because
he
did
not
fear
him
and
after
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
he
spoke
of
him
in
the
highest
terms
and
frankly
acknowledged
the
services
he
had
rendered
on
that
important
occasion
but
he
could
not
endure
his
wife
family
who
he
said
were
a
set
of
intriguers
napoleon
had
good
reason
for
his
opinion
moreau
had
a
and
a
wife
lively
and
given
to
intrigue
bonaparte
could
not
bear
intriguing
women
besides
on
one
occasion
madame
mother
when
at
malmaison
had
indulged
in
sharp
remarks
on
a
suspected
scandalous
intimacy
between
bonaparte
and
his
young
sister
caroline
then
just
married
the
consul
had
not
forgiven
such
conversation

as
to
the
mischief
done
by
madame
hulot
luneville
having
been
fixed
upon
for
the
congress
the
first
consul
sent
his
brother
joseph
to
treat
with
count
louis
de
cobentzel
on
his
way
joseph
met
de
cobentzel
who
had
passed
luneville
and
was
coming
to
paris
to
sound
the
sentiments
of
the
french
government
joseph
returned
to
paris
with
him
after
some
conversation
with
the
first
consul
they
set
out
next
day
for
luneville
of
which
place
bonaparte
appointed
general
clarke
governor
this
appeared
to
satisfy
clarke
who
was
very
anxious
to
be
something
and
had
long
been
importuning
bonaparte
for
an
appointment
a
day
or
two
after
the
news
of
the
battle
of
hohenlinden
maret
came
to
present
for
bonaparte
signature
some
decrees
made
in
council
while
affixing
the
signatures
and
without
looking
up
the
first
consul
said
to
maret
who
was
a
favourite
with
him
and
who
was
standing
at
his
right
hand
are
you
rich
maret
no
general
so
much
the
worse
a
man
should
be
independent
general
i
will
never
be
dependent
on
any
one
but
you
the
first
consul
then
raised
his
eyes
to
maret
and
said
hem
that
is
not
bad
and
when
the
was
gone
he
said
to
me
maret
is
not
deficient
in
cleverness
he
made
me
a
very
good
answer
on
the
of
february
six
weeks
after
the
opening
of
the
congress
of
luneville
peace
was
signed
between
austria
and
france
this
peace
the
fruit
of
marengo
and
hohenlinden
restored
france
to
that
honourable
position
which
had
been
put
in
jeopardy
by
the
feeble
and
incapable
government
of
the
pentarchy
and
the
reverses
of
this
peace
which
in
the
treaty
according
to
custom
was
called
perpetual
lasted
four
years
joseph
bonaparte
while
treating
for
france
at
luneville
was
speculating
on
the
rise
of
the
funds
which
he
thought
the
peace
would
produce
persons
more
wise
who
were
like
him
in
the
secret
sold
out
their
stock
at
the
moment
when
the
certainty
of
the
peace
became
known
but
joseph
purchased
to
a
great
extent
in
the
hope
of
selling
to
advantage
on
the
signature
of
peace
however
the
news
had
been
discounted
and
a
fall
took
place
joseph
loss
was
considerable
and
he
could
not
satisfy
the
engagements
in
which
his
greedy
and
silly
speculations
had
involved
him
he
applied
to
his
brother
who
neither
wished
nor
was
able
to
advance
him
the
necessary
sum
bonaparte
was
however
exceedingly
sorry
to
see
his
elder
brother
in
this
embarrassment
he
asked
me
what
was
to
be
done
i
told
him
i
did
not
know
but
i
advised
him
to
consult
de
talleyrand
from
whom
he
had
often
received
good
advice
he
did
so
and
de
talleyrand
replied
with
that
air
of
coolness
which
is
so
peculiar
to
him
what
is
that
all
oh
that
is
nothing
it
is
easily
settled
you
have
only
to
raise
the
price
of
the
funds
but
the
money
oh
the
money
may
be
easily
obtained
make
some
deposits
in
the
or
the
sinking
fund
that
will
give
you
the
necessary
money
to
raise
the
funds
and
then
joseph
may
sell
out
and
recover
his
losses
de
talleyrand
advice
was
adopted
and
all
succeeded
as
he
had
foretold
none
but
those
who
have
heard
de
talleyrand
converse
can
form
an
accurate
idea
of
his
easy
manner
of
expressing
himself
his
imperturbable
coolness
the
fixed
unvarying
expression
of
his
countenance
and
his
vast
fund
of
wit
talleyrand
had
a
large
experience
in
all
sorts
of
speculation
when
old
he
gave
this
counsel
to
one
of
his
proteges
do
not
speculate
i
have
always
speculated
on
assured
information
and
that
has
cost
me
so
many
millions
and
he
named
his
losses
we
may
believe
that
in
this
reckoning
he
rather
forgot
the
amount
of
his
gains
talleyrand
during
the
sitting
of
the
congress
the
first
consul
learnt
that
the
government
couriers
conveyed
to
favoured
individuals
in
paris
various
things
but
especially
the
delicacies
of
the
table
and
he
ordered
that
this
practice
should
be
discontinued
on
the
very
evening
on
which
this
order
was
issued
cambaceres
entered
the
salon
where
i
was
alone
with
the
first
consul
who
had
already
been
laughing
at
the
mortification
which
he
knew
this
regulation
would
occasion
to
his
colleague
well
cambaceres
what
brings
you
here
at
this
time
of
night
i
come
to
solicit
an
exception
to
the
order
which
you
have
just
given
to
the
director
of
the
posts
how
do
you
think
a
man
can
make
friends
unless
he
keeps
a
good
table
you
know
very
well
how
much
good
dinners
assist
the
business
of
government
the
first
consul
laughed
called
him
a
gourmand
and
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
said
do
not
distress
yourself
my
dear
cambaceres
the
couriers
shall
continue
to
bring
you
your
aux
truffes
your
strasburg
your
mayence
hams
and
your
other
titbits
those
who
recollect
the
magnificent
dinners
given
by
cambaceres
and
others
which
were
a
general
topic
of
conversation
at
the
time
and
who
knew
the
ingenious
calculation
which
was
observed
in
the
invitation
of
the
guests
must
be
convinced
of
the
vast
influence
of
a
good
dinner
in
political
affairs
as
to
cambaceres
he
did
not
believe
that
a
good
government
could
exist
without
good
dinners
and
his
glory
for
every
man
has
his
own
particular
glory
was
to
know
that
the
luxuries
of
his
table
were
the
subject
of
eulogy
throughout
paris
and
even
europe
a
banquet
which
commanded
general
suffrage
was
to
him
a
marengo
or
a
friedland
bourrienne
does
not
exaggerate
this
excellent
quality
of
the
worthy
cambaceres
when
beugnot
was
sent
to
administer
the
grand
duchy
of
berg
cambaceres
said
to
him
my
dear
beugnot
the
emperor
arranges
crowns
as
he
chooses
here
is
the
grand
duke
of
berg
murat
going
to
naples
he
is
welcome
i
have
no
objection
but
every
year
the
grand
duke
sent
me
a
couple
of
dozen
hams
from
his
grand
duchy
and
i
warn
you
i
do
not
intend
to
lose
them
so
you
must
make
your
preparations
i
never
once
omitted
to
acquit
myself
of
the
obligation
and
if
there
were
any
delay
his
highness
never
failed
to
cause
one
of
his
secretaries
to
write
a
good
scolding
to
my
house
steward
but
when
the
hams
arrived
exactly
his
highness
never
failed
to
write
to
my
wife
himself
to
thank
her
this
was
not
all
the
hams
were
to
come
carriage
free
this
petty
jobbery
occasioned
discontent
and
it
would
not
have
cost
me
more
to
pay
the
carriage
the
prince
would
not
allow
it
there
was
an
agreement
between
him
and
lavalette
the
head
of
the
posts
and
my
lord
appeared
to
lay
as
much
stress
on
the
performance
of
this
treaty
as
on
the
procuring
of
the
ham
beugnot
tome
cambaceres
never
suffered
the
cares
of
government
to
distract
his
attention
from
the
great
object
of
life
on
one
occasion
for
example
being
detained
in
consultation
with
napoleon
beyond
the
appointed
hour
of
dinner
it
is
said
that
the
fate
of
the
duc
was
the
topic
under
discussion
he
was
observed
when
the
hour
became
very
late
to
show
great
symptoms
of
impatience
sod
restlessness
he
at
last
wrote
a
note
which
he
called
a
gentleman
usher
in
waiting
to
carry
napoleon
suspecting
the
contents
nodded
to
an
aide
de
camp
to
intercept
the
despatch
as
he
took
it
into
his
hands
cambaceres
begged
earnestly
that
he
would
not
read
a
trifling
note
upon
domestic
matters
napoleon
persisted
and
found
it
to
be
a
note
to
the
cook
containing
only
the
following
words
gardez
les
entremetes
les
rotis
sont
perdue
when
napoleon
was
in
good
humor
at
the
result
of
a
diplomatic
conference
he
was
accustomed
to
take
leave
of
the
plenipotentiaries
with
go
and
dine
cambaceres
his
table
was
in
fact
an
important
state
engine
as
appears
from
the
anecdote
of
the
trout
sent
to
him
by
the
municipality
of
geneva
and
charged
francs
in
their
accounts
the
imperial
des
comptes
having
disallowed
the
item
was
interdicted
from
meddling
with
similar
municipal
affairs
in
future
hayward
art
of
dining
p
at
the
commencement
of
fulton
presented
to
bonaparte
his
memorial
on
steamboats
i
urged
a
serious
examination
of
the
subject
bah
said
he
these
projectors
are
all
either
intriguers
or
visionaries
trouble
me
about
the
business
i
observed
that
the
man
whom
he
called
an
intriguer
was
only
reviving
an
invention
already
known
and
that
it
was
wrong
to
reject
the
scheme
without
examination
he
would
not
listen
to
me
and
thus
was
adjourned
for
some
time
the
practical
application
of
a
discovery
which
has
given
such
an
important
impulse
to
trade
and
navigation
paul
fell
by
the
hands
of
assassins
on
the
night
of
the
of
march
the
first
consul
was
much
shocked
on
receiving
the
intelligence
in
the
excitement
caused
by
this
unexpected
event
which
had
so
important
an
influence
on
his
policy
he
directed
me
to
send
the
following
note
to
the
moniteur
paul
died
on
the
night
of
the
of
march
and
the
english
squadron
passed
the
sound
on
the
history
will
reveal
the
connection
which
probably
exists
between
these
two
events
thus
were
announced
the
crime
of
the
of
march
and
the
not
founded
suspicions
of
its
authors
we
do
not
attempt
to
rescue
the
fair
name
of
out
country
this
is
one
among
many
instances
in
which
bourrienne
was
editor
of
edition
the
amicable
relations
of
paul
and
bonaparte
had
been
daily
strengthened
in
concert
with
the
czar
said
bonaparte
i
was
sure
of
striking
a
mortal
blow
at
the
english
power
in
india
a
palace
revolution
has
overthrown
all
my
projects
this
resolution
and
the
admiration
of
the
autocrat
of
russia
for
the
head
of
the
french
republic
may
certainly
be
numbered
among
the
causes
of
paul
death
the
individuals
generally
accused
at
the
time
were
those
who
were
violently
and
perseveringly
threatened
and
who
had
the
strongest
interest
in
the
succession
of
a
new
emperor
i
have
seen
a
letter
from
a
northern
sovereign
which
in
my
mind
leaves
no
doubt
on
this
subject
and
which
specified
the
reward
of
the
crime
and
the
part
to
be
performed
by
each
actor
but
it
must
also
be
confessed
that
the
conduct
and
character
of
paul
his
tyrannical
acts
his
violent
caprices
and
his
frequent
excesses
of
despotism
had
rendered
him
the
object
of
accumulated
hatred
for
patience
has
its
limit
these
circumstances
did
not
probably
create
the
conspiracy
but
they
considerably
facilitated
the
execution
of
the
plot
which
deprived
the
czar
of
his
throne
and
his
life
as
soon
as
alexander
ascended
the
throne
the
ideas
of
the
first
consul
respecting
the
dismemberment
of
poland
were
revived
and
almost
wholly
engrossed
his
mind
during
his
first
campaign
in
italy
and
several
times
when
in
egypt
he
told
sulkowsky
that
it
was
his
ardent
wish
to
reestablish
poland
to
avenge
the
iniquity
of
her
dismemberment
and
by
that
grand
repertory
act
to
restore
the
former
equilibrium
of
europe
he
often
dictated
to
me
for
the
articles
tending
to
prove
by
various
arguments
that
europe
would
never
enjoy
repose
until
those
great
spoilations
were
avenged
and
repaired
but
he
frequently
destroyed
these
articles
instead
of
sending
them
to
press
his
system
of
policy
towards
russia
changed
shortly
after
the
death
of
paul
the
thought
of
a
war
against
that
empire
unceasingly
occupied
his
mind
and
gave
birth
to
the
idea
of
that
fatal
campaign
which
took
place
eleven
years
afterwards
and
which
had
other
causes
than
the
of
poland
that
object
was
merely
set
forward
as
a
pretext
duroc
was
sent
to
petersburg
to
congratulate
the
emperor
alexander
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
he
arrived
in
the
russian
capital
on
the
of
may
duroc
who
was
at
this
time
very
young
was
a
great
favourite
of
the
first
consul
he
never
importuned
bonaparte
by
his
solicitations
and
was
never
troublesome
in
recommending
any
one
or
busying
himself
as
an
agent
for
favour
yet
he
warmly
advocated
the
cause
of
those
whom
he
thought
injured
and
honestly
repelled
accusations
which
he
knew
to
be
false
these
moral
qualities
joined
to
an
agreeable
person
and
elegant
manners
rendered
him
a
very
superior
man
the
year
was
moreover
marked
by
the
fatal
creation
of
special
tribunals
which
were
in
no
way
justified
by
the
urgency
of
circumstances
this
year
also
saw
the
of
the
african
company
the
treaty
of
luneville
which
augmented
the
advantages
france
had
obtained
by
the
treaty
of
and
the
peace
concluded
between
spain
and
portugal
by
means
of
lucien
on
the
subject
of
this
peace
i
may
mention
that
portugal
to
obtain
the
cession
of
olivenza
secretly
offered
bonaparte
through
me
of
francs
if
he
would
contribute
his
influence
towards
the
acquisition
of
that
town
by
portugal
he
rejected
this
offer
indignantly
declaring
that
he
would
never
sell
honour
for
money
he
has
been
accused
of
having
listened
to
a
similar
proposition
at
passeriano
though
in
fact
no
such
proposition
was
ever
made
to
him
those
who
bring
forward
such
accusations
little
know
the
inflexibility
of
his
principles
on
this
point
one
evening
in
april
an
english
paper
the
london
gazette
arrived
at
malmaison
it
announced
the
landing
in
egypt
of
the
army
commanded
by
abercromby
the
battle
given
by
the
english
and
the
death
of
their
general
i
immediately
translated
the
article
and
presented
it
to
the
first
consul
with
the
conviction
that
the
news
would
be
very
painful
to
him
he
doubted
its
truth
or
at
least
pretended
to
do
so
several
officers
and
aides
de
camp
who
were
in
the
salon
coincided
in
his
opinion
especially
lannes
bessieres
and
duroc
they
thought
by
so
doing
to
please
the
first
consul
who
then
said
to
me
in
a
jeering
tone
bah
you
do
not
understand
english
this
is
the
way
with
you
you
are
always
inclined
to
believe
bad
news
rather
than
good
these
words
and
the
approving
smiles
of
the
gentlemen
present
ruffled
me
and
i
said
with
some
warmth
how
general
can
you
believe
that
the
english
government
would
publish
officially
so
important
an
event
if
it
were
not
true
do
you
think
that
a
government
that
has
any
would
in
the
face
of
europe
state
a
falsehood
respecting
an
affair
the
truth
of
which
can
not
long
remain
unknown
did
you
ever
know
an
instance
of
so
important
an
announcement
proving
untrue
after
it
had
been
published
in
the
london
gazette
i
believe
it
to
be
true
and
the
smiles
of
these
gentlemen
will
not
alter
my
opinion
on
these
observations
the
first
consul
rose
and
said
come
bourrienne
i
want
you
in
the
library
after
we
had
left
the
salon
he
added
this
is
always
the
way
with
you
why
are
you
vexed
at
such
trifles
i
assure
you
i
believe
the
news
but
too
confidently
and
i
feared
it
before
it
came
but
they
think
they
please
me
by
thus
appearing
to
doubt
it
never
mind
them
i
ask
your
pardon
said
i
but
i
conceive
the
best
way
of
proving
my
attachment
to
you
is
to
tell
you
what
i
believe
to
be
true
you
desire
me
not
to
delay

thought
it

his
policy
to
place
one
on
the

of
a

and
even

wished
to
accustom

to
the
sight
of
a

it
will
hereafter
be
seen
that
he
gave
sceptres
like
his
confidence

and
that
he
was
always
ready

undo

louis
and
his

they
left
madrid
and
travelled
through
france
the
prince
took
the
title
of
count
of
leghorn
all
accounts
are
unanimous
as
to
the
attentions
which
the
prince
and
princess
received
on
their
journey
among
the
fetes
in
honour
of
the
illustrious
couple
that
given
by
de
talleyrand
at
neuilly
was
remarkable
for
magnificence
when
the
count
of
leghorn
was
coming
to
pay
his
first
visit
to
malmaison
bonaparte
went
into
the
to
see
that
everything
was
suitably
prepared
for
his
reception
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
to
his
cabinet
and
said
to
me
somewhat
out
of
humour
bourrienne
only
think
of
their
stupidity
they
had
not
taken
down
the
picture
representing
me
on
the
summit
of
the
alps
pointing
to
lombardy
and
commanding
the
conquest
of
it
i
have
ordered
its
removal
how
mortifying
it
would
have
been
if
the
prince
had
seen
it
another
picture
in
the
at
malmaison
represented
the
first
consul
sleeping
on
the
snow
on
the
summit
of
the
alps
before
the
battle
of
marengo
the
count
of
leghorn
visit
to
paris
imparted
brilliancy
to
the
first
years
of
the
reign
of
bonaparte
of
whom
it
was
at
that
time
said
he
made
kings
but
would
not
be
one
at
the
representation
of
aedipus
the
following
expression
of
philactetes
was
received
with
transport
fait
des

et
pas
voulu
monarchs
i
made
but
one
i
would
not
be
the
first
consul
on
leaving
the
theatre
did
not
conceal
his
satisfaction
he
judged
from
the
applause
with
which
that
verse
had
been
received
that
his
pamphlet
was
forgotten
the
manner
moreover
in
which
a
king
crowned
by
his
hands
had
been
received
by
the
public
was
no
indifferent
matter
to
him
as
he
expected
that
the
people
would
thus
again
become
familiar
with
what
had
been
so
long
proscribed
this
king
who
though
well
received
and
well
entertained
was
in
all
respects
a
very
ordinary
man
departed
for
italy
i
say
very
ordinary
not
that
i
had
an
opportunity
of
judging
of
his
character
myself
but
the
first
consul
told
me
that
his
capabilities
were
extremely
limited
that
he
even
felt
repugnance
to
take
a
pen
in
his
hand
that
he
never
cast
a
thought
on
anything
but
his
pleasures
in
a
word
that
he
was
a
fool
one
day
after
the
first
consul
had
spent
several
hours
in
company
with
him
and
his
consort
he
said
to
me
i
am
quite
tired
he
is
a
mere
automaton
i
put
a
number
of
questions
to
him
but
he
can
answer
none
he
is
obliged
to
consult
his
wife
who
makes
him
understand
as
well
as
she
is
able
what
he
ought
to
say
the
first
consul
added
the
poor
prince
will
set
off
without
knowing
what
he
is
going
to
do
i
observed
that
it
was
a
pity
to
see
the
happiness
of
the
people
of
tuscany
entrusted
to
such
a
prince
bonaparte
replied
policy
requires
it
besides
the
young
man
is
not
worse
than
the
usual
run
of
kings
the
prince
fully
justified
in
tuscany
the
opinion
which
the
first
consul
formed
of
him
this
unfortunate
prince
was
very
to
recommend
by
his
personal
character
the
institutions
to
which
the
nobility
clung
with
so
much
fondness
nature
had
endowed
him
with
an
excellent
heart
but
with
very
limited
talents
and
his
mind
had
imbibed
the
false
impress
consequent
upon
his
monastic
education
he
resided
at
malmaison
nearly
the
whole
time
of
his
visit
to
paris
madame
bonaparte
used
to
lead
the
queen
to
her
own
apartments
and
as
the
first
consul
never
left
his
closet
except
to
sit
down
to
meals
the
aides
de
camp
were
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
king
company
and
of
endeavoring
to
entertain
him
so
wholly
was
he
devoid
of
intellectual
resources
it
required
indeed
a
great
share
of
patience
to
listen
to
the
frivolities
which
engrossed
his
attention
his
turn
of
mind
being
thus
laid
open
to
view
care
was
taken
to
supply
him
with
the
playthings
usually
placed
in
the
hands
of
children
he
was
therefore
never
at
a
loss
for
occupation
his
nonentity
was
a
source
of
regret
to
us
we
lamented
to
see
s
tall
handsome
youth
destined
to
rule
over
his
trembling
at
the
eight
of
a
horse
and
wasting
his
time
in
the
game
of
seek
or
at
and
whose
whole
information
consisted
in
knowing
his
prayers
and
in
saying
grace
before
and
after
meals
such
nevertheless
was
the
man
to
whom
the
destinies
of
a
nation
were
about
to
be
committed
when
he
left
france
to
repair
to
his
kingdom
rome
need
not
be
uneasy
said
the
first
consul
to
us
after
the
farewell
audience
there
is
no
danger
of
his
crossing
the
rubicon
memoirs
of
the
duke
of
rovigo
vol
in
order
to
show
still
further
attention
to
the
king
of
etruria
after
his
three
weeks
visit
to
paris
the
first
consul
directed
him
to
be
escorted
to
italy
by
a
french
guard
and
selected
his
murat
for
that
purpose
the
new
king
of
a
new
kingdom
entered
florence
on
the
of
april
but
the
reception
given
him
by
the
tuscans
was
not
at
all
similar
to
what
he
had
experienced
at
paris
the
people
received
the
royal
pair
as
sovereigns
imposed
on
them
by
france
the
ephemeral
kingdom
of
etruria
lasted
scarcely
six
years
the
king
died
in
in
the
flower
of
his
age
and
in
the
queen
was
expelled
from
her
throne
by
him
who
had
constructed
it
for
her
at
this
period
a
powerful
party
urged
bonaparte
to
break
with
the
pope
and
to
establish
a
gallican
church
the
head
of
which
should
reside
in
france
they
thought
to
flatter
his
ambition
by
indicating
to
him
a
new
source
of
power
which
might
establish
a
point
of
comparison
between
him
and
the
first
roman
emperors
but
his
ideas
did
not
coincide
with
theirs
on
this
subject
i
am
convinced
said
he
that
a
part
of
france
would
become
protestant
especially
if
i
were
to
favour
that
disposition
i
am
also
certain
that
the
much
greater
portion
would
remain
catholic
and
would
oppose
with
the
greatest
zeal
and
fervour
the
schism
of
a
part
of
their
i
dread
the
religious
quarrels
the
family
dissensions
and
the
public
distractions
which
such
a
state
of
things
would
inevitably
occasion
in
reviving
a
religion
which
has
always
prevailed
in
the
country
and
which
still
prevails
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
in
giving
the
liberty
of
exercising
their
worship
to
the
minority
i
shall
satisfy
every
one
the
first
consul
taking
a
superior
view
of
the
state
of
france
considered
that
the
of
religious
worship
would
prove
a
powerful
support
to
his
government
and
he
had
been
occupied
ever
since
the
commencement
of
in
preparing
a
concordat
with
the
pope
it
was
signed
in
the
month
of
july
in
the
same
year
it
required
some
time
to
enable
the
parties
to
come
to
an
understanding
on
the
subject
cardinal
consalvi
arrived
in
the
month
of
june
at
paris
to
arrange
matters
on
the
part
of
the
pope
cardinal
caprara
and
de
spina
also
formed
part
of
the
embassy
sent
by
the
holy
father
there
were
besides
several
able
theologians
among

the
details
of
the
surprise
attempted
at
the
last
moment
by
putting
before
cardinal
consalvi
for
his
signature
an
altered
copy
of
the
concordat
should
be
read
in
his
memoirs
tome
or
in
lanfrey
tome
ii
as
for
belief
that
part
of
the
nation
might
become
protestant
narbonne
probably
put
the
matter
truly
when
he
said
there
was
not
religion
enough
in
france
to
stand
a
division
it
should
be
noted
that
the
concordat
did
not
so
much
restore
the
catholic
church
as
destroy
the
old
gallican
church
with
all
its
liberties
which
might
annoy
either
pope
or
emperor
but
on
this
point
see
the
gallican
church
and
the
revolution
by
jervis
london
began
paul
trench
and
the
clergy
may
it
is
true
have
shown
wisdom
in
acceding
to
any
terms
of
restoration
he
was
a
member
of
the
pope
chancery
his
knowledge
gave
him
so
much
influence
over
his
colleagues
that
affairs
advanced
only
as
much
as
he
pleased
however
he
was
gained
over
by
honours
conferred
on
him
and
promises
of
money
business
then
went
on
a
little
quicker
the
concordat
was
signed
on
the
of
july
and
made
a
law
of
the
state
in
the
following
april
the
plenipotentiaries
on
the
part
of
bonaparte
were
joseph
bonaparte
cretet
and
the
abby
bernier
afterwards
bishop
of
versailles
orleans
not
versailles
a
solemn
te
deum
was
chanted
at
the
cathedral
of
notre
dame
on
sunday
the
of
april
the
crowd
was
immense
and
the
greater
part
of
those
present
stood
during
the
ceremony
which
was
splendid
in
the
extreme
but
who
would
presume
to
say
that
the
general
feeling
was
in
harmony
with
all
this
pomp
was
then
the
time
for
this
innovation
not
yet
arrived
was
it
too
abrupt
a
transition
from
the
habits
of
the
twelve
preceding
years
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
a
great
number
of
the
persons
present
at
the
ceremony
expressed
in
their
countenances
and
gestures
rather
a
feeling
of
impatience
and
displeasure
than
of
satisfaction
or
of
reverence
for
the
place
in
which
they
were
here
and
there
murmurs
arose
expressive
of
discontent
the
whispering
which
i
might
more
properly
call
open
conversation
often
interrupted
the
divine
service
and
sometimes
observations
were
made
which
were
far
from
being
moderate
some
would
turn
their
heads
aside
on
purpose
to
take
a
bit
of
cake
and
biscuits
were
openly
eaten
by
many
who
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
what
was
passing
the
consular
court
was
in
general
extremely
irreligious
nor
could
it
be
expected
to
be
otherwise
being
composed
chiefly
of
those
who
had
assisted
in
the
annihilation
of
all
religious
worship
in
france
and
of
men
who
having
passed
their
lives
in
camps
had
oftener
entered
a
church
in
italy
to
carry
off
a
painting
than
to
hear
the
mass
those
who
without
being
imbued
with
any
religious
ideas
possessed
that
good
sense
which
induces
men
to
pay
respect
to
the
belief
of
others
though
it
be
one
in
which
they
do
not
participate
did
not
blame
the
first
consul
for
his
conduct
and
conducted
themselves
with
some
regard
to
decency
but
on
the
road
from
the
tuileries
to
notre
dame
lannes
and
augereau
wanted
to
alight
from
the
carriage
as
soon
as
they
saw
that
they
ware
being
driven
to
mass
and
it
required
an
order
from
the
first
consul
to
prevent
their
doing
so
they
went
therefore
to
notre
dame
and
the
next
day
bonaparte
asked
augereau
what
he
thought
of
the
ceremony
oh
it
was
all
very
fine
replied
the
general
there
was
nothing
wanting
except
the
million
of
men
who
have
perished
in
the
pulling
down
of
what
you
are
setting
up
bonaparte
was
much
displeased
at
this
remark
this
remark
has
been
attributed
elsewhere
to
general
delmas
according
to
a
gentleman
who
played
a
part
in
this
empty
pageantry
lannes
at
one
moment
did
get
out
of
the
carriage
and
augerean
kept
swearing
in
no
low
whisper
during
the
whole
of
the
chanted
mass
most
of
the
military
chiefs
who
sprang
out
of
the
revolution
had
no
religion
at
all
but
there
were
some
who
were
protestants
and
who
were
irritated
by
the
restoration
of
catholicism
as
the
national
editor
of
edition
during
the
negotiations
with
the
holy
father
bonaparte
one
day
said
to
me
in
every
country
religion
is
useful
to
the
government
and
those
who
govern
ought
to
avail
themselves
of
it
to
influence
mankind
i
was
a
mahometan
in
egypt
i
am
a
catholic
in
france
with
relation
to
the
police
of
the
religion
of
a
state
it
should
be
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
sovereign
many
persons
have
urged
me
to
found
a
gallican
church
and
make
myself
its
head
but
they
do
not
know
france
if
they
did
they
would
know
that
the
majority
of
the
people
would
not
like
a
rupture
with
rome
before
i
can
resolve
on
such
a
measure
the
pope
must
push
matters
to
an
extremity
but
i
believe
he
will
not
do
so
you
are
right
general
and
you
recall
to
my
memory
what
cardinal
consalvi
said
pope
will
do
all
the
first
consul
desires
that
is
the
best
course
for
him
let
him
not
suppose
that
he
has
to
do
with
an
idiot
what
do
you
think
is
the
point
his
negotiations
put
most
forward
the
salvation
of
my
soul
but
with
me
immortality
is
the
recollection
one
leaves
in
the
memory
of
man
that
idea
prompts
to
great
actions
it
would
be
better
for
a
man
never
to
have
lived
than
to
leave
behind
him
no
traces
of
his
existence
many
endeavours
were
made
to
persuade
the
first
consul
to
perform
in
public
the
duties
imposed
by
the
catholic
religion
an
influential
example
it
was
urged
was
required
he
told
me
once
that
he
had
put
an
end
to
that
request
by
the
following
declaration
enough
of
this
ask
me
no
more
you
will
not
obtain
your
object
you
shall
never
make
a
hypocrite
of
me
let
us
remain
where
we
are
i
have
read
in
a
work
remarkable
on
many
accounts
that
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
concordat
of
the
july
that
the
first
consul
abolished
the
republican
calendar
and
reestablished
the
gregorian
this
is
an
error
he
did
not
make
the
calendar
a
religious
affair
the
which
restored
the
use
of
the
gregorian
calendar
to
commence
in
the
french
empire
from
the
nivose
year
xiv
january
was
adopted
on
the
fructidor
year
xiii
september
more
than
four
years
after
the
concordat
the
establishment
of
the
ancient
calendar
had
no
other
object
than
to
bring
us
into
harmony
with
the
rest
of
europe
on
a
point
so
closely
connected
with
daily
transactions
which
were
much
embarrassed
by
the
decadary
calendar
bonaparte
at
length
however
consented
to
hear
mass
and
st
cloud
was
the
place
where
this
ancient
usage
was
first
he
directed
the
ceremony
to
commence
sooner
than
the
hour
announced
in
order
that
those
who
would
only
make
a
scoff
at
it
might
not
arrive
until
the
service
was
ended
whenever
the
first
consul
determined
to
hear
mass
publicly
on
sundays
in
the
chapel
of
the
palace
a
small
altar
was
prepared
in
a
room
near
his
cabinet
of
business
this
room
had
been
anne
of
austria
oratory
a
small
portable
altar
placed
on
a
platform
one
step
high
restored
it
to
its
original
destination
during
the
rest
of
the
week
this
chapel
was
used
as
a
on
sunday
the
door
of
communication
was
opened
and
we
heard
mass
sitting
in
our
cabinet
of
business
the
number
of
persons
there
never
exceeded
three
or
four
and
the
first
consul
seldom
failed
to
transact
some
business
during
the
ceremony
which
never
lasted
longer
than
twelve
minutes
next
day
all
the
papers
had
the
news
that
the
first
consul
had
heard
mass
in
his
apartments
in
the
same
way
louis
xviii
has
often
heard
it
in
his
on
the
of
july
a
papal
bull
absolved
talleyrand
from
his
vows
he
immediately
married
madame
grandt
and
the
affair
obtained
little
notice
at
the
time
this
statement
sufficiently
proves
how
report
has
perverted
the
fact
it
has
been
said
that
bonaparte
on
becoming
emperor
wished
to
restore
that
decorum
which
the
revolution
had
destroyed
and
therefore
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
the
improper
intimacy
which
subsisted
between
talleyrand
and
madame
grandt
it
is
alleged
that
the
minister
at
first
refused
to
marry
the
lady
but
that
he
at
last
found
it
necessary
to
obey
the
peremptory
order
of
his
master
this
pretended
resurrection
of
morality
by
bonaparte
is
excessively
ridiculous
the
bull
was
not
registered
in
the
council
of
state
until
the
of
august
the
first
consul
had
on
several
occasions
urged
de
talleyrand
to
return
to
holy
orders
he
pointed
out
to
him
that
that
course
world
be
most
becoming
his
age
and
high
birth
and
premised
that
he
should
be
made
a
cardinal
thus
raising
him
to
a
par
with
richelieu

giving
additional
lustre

foreign

myself
on

the

of

extraordinary
madame

condescended
to
have
an
elegant
but
somewhat
ideal
costume
made
for
me
it
pleased
the
first
consul
however
and
he
had
a
similar
one
made
for
himself
he
wore
it
a
short
time
and
then
left
it
off
never
had
bonaparte
since
his
elevation
shown
himself
so
amiable
as
on
this
occasion

i
shall
return
to
the
affairs
of
egypt
to
that
episode
which
embraces
so
short
a
space
of
time
and
holds
so
high
a
place
in
the
life
of
bonaparte
of
all
his
conquests
he
set
the
highest
value
on
egypt
because
it
spread
the
glory
of
his
name
throughout
the
east
accordingly
he
left
nothing
unattempted
for
the
preservation
of
that
colony
in
a
letter
to
general
kleber
he
said
you
are
as
able
as
i
am
to
understand
how
important
is
the
possession
of
egypt
to
france
the
turkish
empire
in
which
the
symptoms
of
decay
are
everywhere
discernible
is
at
present
falling
to
pieces
and
the
evil
of
the
evacuation
of
egypt
by
france
would
now
be
the
greater
as
we
should
soon
see
that
fine
province
pass
into
the
possession
of
some
other
european
power
the
selection
of
gantheaume
however
to
carry
assistance
to
kleber
was
not
judicious
gantheaume
had
brought
the
first
consul
back
from
egypt
and
though
the
success
of
the
passage
could
only
be
attributed
to
bonaparte
own
plan
his
determined
character
and
superior
judgment
yet
he
preserved
towards
gantheaume
that
favourable
disposition
which
is
naturally
felt
for
one
who
has
shared
a
great
danger
with
us
and
upon
whom
the
responsibility
may
be
said
to
have
been
imposed
this
confidence
in
mediocrity
dictated
by
an
honourable
feeling
did
not
obtain
a
suitable
return
gantheaume
by
his
indecision
and
creeping
about
in
the
mediterranean
had
already
failed
to
execute
a
commission
entrusted
to
him
the
first
consul
upon
finding
he
did
not
leave
brest
after
he
had
been
ordered
to
the
mediterranean
repeatedly
said
to
me
what
the
devil
is
gantheaume
about
with
one
of
the
daily
reports
sent
to
the

he
received

hesitation
his
frequent
tergiversations
his
arrival
at
toulon
his
tardy
departure
and
his
return
to
that
port
on
the
of
february
only
ten
days
prior
to
admiral
keith
appearance
with
sir
ralph
abercromby
off
alexandria
completely
foiled
all
the
plans
which
bonaparte
had
conceived
of
conveying
succour
and
reinforcements
to
a
colony
on
the
brink
of
destruction
bonaparte
was
then
dreaming
that
many
french
families
would
carry
back
civilisation
science
and
art
to
that
country
which
was
their
cradle
but
it
could
not
be
concealed
that
his
departure
from
egypt
in
had
prepared
the
way
for
the
loss
of
that
country
which
was
hastened
by
kleber
death
and
the
choice
of
menou
as
his
successor
a
sure
way
of
paying
court
to
the
first
consul
and
gaining
his
favour
was
to
eulogise
his
views
about
egypt
and
to
appear
zealous
for
maintaining
the
possession
of
that
country
by
these
means
it
was
that
menou
gained
his
confidence
in
the
first
year
of
the
occupation
of
that
country
he
laid
before
him
his
dreams
respecting
africa
he
spoke
of
the
negroes
of
senegal
mozambique
mehedie
marabout
and
other
barbarous
countries
which
were
all
at
once
to
assume
a
new
aspect
and
become
civilised
in
consequence
of
the
french
possession
of
egypt
to
menou
adulation
is
to
be
attributed
the
favourable
reception
given
him
by
the
first
consul
even
after
his
return
from
egypt
of
which
his
foolish
conduct
had
allowed
the
english
to
get
possession
the
first
consul
appointed
him
governor
of
piedmont
and
at
my
request
gave
my
elder
brother
the
situation
of
of
police
in
that
country
but
i
am
in
candour
obliged
to
confess
that
the
first
consul
was
obliged
to
retract
this
mark
of
his
favour
in
consequence
of
my
brother
making
an
abuse
of
it
it
was
also
by
flattering
the
first
consul
on
the
question
of
the
east
that
davoust
on
his
return
from
egypt
in
in
consequence
of
the
convention
of
insinuated
himself
into
bonaparte
good
graces
and
if
he
did
not
deserve
obtained
his
favour
at
that
time
davoust
certainly
had
no
title
whatever
to
the
good
fortune
which
he
suddenly
experienced
he
obtained
without
first
serving
in
a
subordinate
rank
the
of
the
grenadiers
of
the
consular
guard
and
from
that
time
commenced
the
deadly
hatred
which
davoust
bore
towards
me
astonished
at
the
great
length
of
time
that
bonaparte
had
been
one
day
conversing
with
him
i
said
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
how
could
you
talk
so
long
with
a
man
whom
you
have
always
called
a
stupid
fellow
ah
but
i
did
not
know
him
well
enough
before
he
is
a
better
man
i
assure
you
than
he
is
thought
and
you
will
come
over
to
my
opinion
i
hope
so
the
first
consul
who
was
often
extremely
indiscreet
told
davoust
my
opinion
of
him
and
his
hostility
against
me
ceased
but
with
his
life
the
first
consul
could
not
forget
his
cherished
conquest
in
the
east
it
was
constantly
the
object
of
his
thoughts
he
endeavoured
to
send
reinforcements
to
his
army
from
brest
and
toulon
but
without
success
he
soon
had
cause
to
repent
having
entrusted
to
the
hands
of
menou
the
to
which
he
became
entitled
only
by
seniority
after
the
assassination
of
kleber
by
soleiman
heleby
but
indignation
was
excited
when
he
became
acquainted
with
menou
neglect
and
mismanagement
when
he
saw
him
giving
reins
to
his
passion
for
reform
altering
and
destroying
everything
creating
nothing
good
in
its
stead
and
dreaming
about
forming
a
land
communication
with
the
hottentots
and
congo
instead
of
studying
how
to
preserve
the
country
his
pitiful
plans
of
defence
which
were
useless
from
their
want
of
combination
appeared
to
the
first
consul
the
height
of
ignorance
forgetful
of
all
the
principles
of
strategy
of
which
bonaparte
conduct
afforded
so
many
examples
he
opposed
to
the
landing
of
abercromby
a
few
isolated
corps
which
were
unable
to
withstand
the
enemy
attack
while
the
english
army
might
have
been
entirely
annihilated
had
all
the
disposable
troops
been
sent
against
it
the
great
admiration
which
menou
expressed
at
the
expedition
to
egypt
his
excessive
fondness
for
that
country
the
religion
of
which
he
had
ridiculously
enough
embraced
under
the
name
of
abdallah
the
efforts
he
made
in
his
sphere
to
preserve
the
colony
his
enthusiasm
and
blind
attachment
to
bonaparte
the
flattering
and
encouraging
accounts
he
gave
of
the
situation
of
the
army
at
first
had
the
effect
of
entirely
covering
menou
incapacity
for
a
ludicrous
description
of
menou
see
the
memoirs
of
marmont
clever
and
gay
ho
was
an
agreeable
talker
but
a
great
liar
he
was
not
destitute
of
some
education
his
character
one
of
the
oddest
in
the
world
came
very
near
to
lunacy
constantly
writing
always
in
motion
in
his
room
riding
for
exercise
every
day
he
was
never
able
to
start
on
any
necessary
of
useful
journey
when
later
bonaparte
then
first
consul
gave
him
by
special
favour
the
administration
of
piedmont
he
put
off
his
departure
from
day
to
day
for
six
months
and
then
he
only
did
start
because
his
friend
maret
himself
put
him
into
his
carriage
with
already
harnessed
to
it
when
he
left
this
post
they
found
in
his
cabinet
letters
which
he
had
not
opened
he
was
an
eccentric
lunatic
amusing
enough
sometimes
but
a
curse
to
everything
which
depended
on
him
memoirs
of
the
duc
de
raguse
tome
p
this
alone
can
account
for
the
first
consul
preference
of
him
but
i
am
far
from
concurring
in
what
has
been
asserted
by
many
persons
that
france
lost
egypt
at
the
very
moment
when
it
seemed
most
easy
of
preservation
egypt
was
conquered
by
a
genius
of
vast
intelligence
great
capacity
and
profound
military
science
fatuity
stupidity
and
incapacity
lost
it
what
was
the
result
of
that
memorable
expedition
the
destruction
of
one
of
our
finest
armies
the
loss
of
some
of
our
best
generals
the
annihilation
of
our
navy
the
surrender
of
malta
and
the
sovereignty
of
england
in
the
mediterranean
what
is
the
result
at
present
a
scientific
work
the
gossiping
stories
and
mystifications
of
herodotus
and
the
reveries
of
the
good
rollin
are
worth
as
much
and
have
not
cost
so
dear
the
first
consul
had
long
been
apprehensive
that
the
evacuation
of
egypt
was
unavoidable
the
last
news
he
had
received
from
that
country
was
not
very
encouraging
and
created
a
presentiment
of
the
approach
of
the
dreaded
catastrophe
he
however
published
the
contrary
but
it
was
then
of
great
importance
that
an
account
of
the
evacuation
should
not
reach
england
until
the
preliminaries
of
peace
were
signed
for
which
purpose
otto
was
exerting
all
his
industry
and
talent
we
made
a
great
merit
of
abandoning
our
conquests
in
egypt
but
the
sacrifice
would
not
have
been
considered
great
if
the
events
which
took
place
at
the
end
of
august
had
been
known
in
london
before
the
signing
of
the
preliminaries
on
the
of
october
the
first
consul
himself
answered
otto
last
despatch
containing
a
copy
of
the
preliminaries
ready
to
be
adopted
by
the
english
ministry
neither
this
despatch
nor
the
answer
was
communicated
to
de
talleyrand
then
minister
for
foreign
affairs
the
first
consul
who
highly
appreciated
the
great
talents
and
knowledge
of
that
minister
never
closed
any
diplomatic
arrangement
without
first
consulting
him
and
he
was
right
in
so
doing
on
this
occasion
however
i
told
him
that
as
de
talleyrand
was
for
his
health
taking
the
waters
of
four
days
must
elapse
before
his
reply
could
be
received
and
that
the
delay
might
cause
the
face
of
affairs
to
change
i
reminded
him
that
egypt
was
on
the
point
of
yielding
he
took
my
advice
and
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
did
for
the
news
of
the
compulsory
evacuation
of
egypt
arrived
in
london
the
day
after
the
signing
of
the
preliminaries
otto
informed
the
first
consul
by
letter
that
lord
hawkesbury
ill
communicating
to
him
the
news
of
the
evacuation
told
him
he
was
very
glad
everything
was
settled
for
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
treated
on
the
same
basis
after
the
arrival
of
such
news
in
reality
we
consented
at
paris
to
the
voluntary
evacuation
of
egypt
and
that
was
something
for
england
while
egypt
was
at
that
very
time
evacuated
by
a
convention
made
on
the
spot
the
definitive
evacuation
of
egypt
took
place
on
the
of
august
and
thus
the
conquest
of
that
country
which
had
cost
so
dear
was
rendered
useless
or
rather
injurious

the

was

pure
and

was
full
of

who
were

little
accustomed
to
look
closely

could

lurking

laurels
of

the
proposals
which
the

made
in

to
obtain

sufficiently
prove
his
sincere
desire
for

he
felt
that
if
in

he
could

his
name
with
so
hoped
for
an
act
he
should
ever
experience
the
affection
and
gratitude
of
the
french
i
want
no

his
sentiments
than
the
offer
he
made

ceylon

was
retained
by

required

and
all

places
taken
by
the
english
in
the
west
indies
england
had
firmly
resolved
to
keep
malta
the
gibraltar
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
caravanserai
of
the
indies
she
was
therefore
unwilling
to
close
with
the
proposition
respecting
malta
and
she
said
that
an
arrangement
might
be
made
by
which
it
would
be
rendered
independent
both
of
great
britain
and
france
we
clearly
saw
that
this
was
only
a
lure
and
that
whatever
arrangements
might
be
entered
into
england
would
keep
malta
because
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
maritime
power
would
willingly
surrender
an
island
which
commands
the
mediterranean
i
do
not
notice
the
discussions
respecting
the
american
islands
for
they
were
in
my
opinion
of
little
consequence
to
us
it
is
strange
that
bourrienne
does
not
allude
to
one
of
the
first
arbitrary
acts
of
napoleon
the
discussions
on
which
formed
part
of
those
conversations
between
napoleon
and
his
brother
lucien
of
which
bourrienne
complained
to
josephine
he
knew
nothing
in
france
had
ceded
to
england
the
part
of
louisiana
on
the
east
of
the
mississippi
and
the
part
on
the
west
of
that
river
with
new
orleans
to
spain
by
the
treaty
negotiated
with
spain
by
lucien
bonaparte
in
her
share
was
given
back
to
france
on
the
april
napoleon
sold
the
whole
to
the
united
states
for
francs
l
to
the
intense
anger
of
his
brothers
joseph
and
lucien
lucien
was
especially
proud
of
having
obtained
the
cession
for
which
napoleon
was
at
that
time
very
anxious
but
both
brothers
were
horrified
when
napoleon
disclosed
how
little
he
cared
for
constitutional
forms
by
telling
them
that
if
the
legislature
as
his
brothers
threatened
would
not
ratify
the
treaty
he
would
do
without
the
ratification
see
iung
letter
tome
ii
napoleon
most
obvious
motives
were
want
of
money
and
the
certainty
of
the
seizure
of
the
province
by
england
as
the
rupture
with
her
was
now
certain
but
there
was
perhaps
another
cause
the
states
had
already
been
on
the
point
of
seizing
the
province
from
spain
which
had
interfered
with
their
trade
hinton
united
states
and
thiers
tome
iv
of
the
sum
to
be
paid
were
to
go
to
the
states
to
cover
the
illegal
seizures
of
american
ships
by
the
french
navy
a
matter
which
was
not
settled
for
many
years
later
the
remaining
were
employed
in
the
preparations
for
the
invasion
of
england
see
thiers
tome
iv
pp
and
and
lanfrey
tome
iii
the
transaction
is
a
remarkable
one
as
forming
the
final
withdrawal
of
france
from
north
america
with
the
exception
of
some
islands
on
the
newfoundland
coast
where
she
had
once
held
such
a
proud
position
it
also
eventually
made
an
addition
to
the
number
of
slave
states
they
cost
more
than
they
produce
and
they
will
escape
from
us
some
time
or
other
as
all
colonies
ultimately
do
from
the
parent
country
our
whole
colonial
system
is
absurd
it
forces
us
to
pay
for
colonial
produce
at
a
rate
nearly
double
that
for
which
it
may
be
purchased
from
our
neighbours
when
lord
hawkesbury
consented
to
evacuate
malta
on
condition
that
it
should
be
independent
of
france
and
great
britain
he
must
have
been
aware
that
such
a
condition
would
never
be
fulfilled
he
cared
little
for
the
order
of
john
and
he
should
have
put
by
way
of
postscript
at
the
bottom
of
his
note
we
will
keep
malta
in
spite
of
you
i
always
told
the
first
consul
that
if
he
were
in
the
situation
of
the
english
he
would
act
the
same
part
and
it
did
not
require
much
sagacity
to
foretell
that
malta
would
be
the
principal
cause
of
the
rupture
of
peace
he
was
of
my
opinion
but
at
that
moment
he
thought
everything
depended
on
concluding
the
negotiations
and
i
entirely
agreed
with
him
it
happened
as
was
foreseen
that
malta
caused
the
renewal
of
war
the
english
on
being
called
upon
to
surrender
the
island
eluded
the
demand
shifted
about
and
at
last
ended
by
demanding
that
malta
should
be
placed
under
the
protection
of
the
king
of
naples
that
is
to
say
under
the
protection
of
a
power
entirely
at
their
command
and
to
which
they
might
dictate
what
they
pleased
this
was
really
too
cool
a
piece
of
irony
i
will
here
notice
the
quarrel
between
the
first
consul
and
the
english
newspapers
and
give
a
new
proof
of
his
views
concerning
the
freedom
of
the
press
however
liberty
of
the
press
did
once
contribute
to
give
him
infinite
gratification
namely
when
all
the
london
journals
mentioned
the
transports
of
joy
manifested
in
london
on
the
arrival
of
general
lauriston
the
bearer
of
the
ratification
of
the
preliminaries
of
peace
the
first
consul
was
at
all
times
the
declared
enemy
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
therefore
he
ruled
the
journals
with
a
hand
of
iron
an
incident
illustrative
of
the
great
irritation
which
bonaparte
felt
at
the
plain
speaking
of
the
english
press
also
shows
the
important
character
of
coleridge
writings
in
the
post
in
the
course
of
a
debate
in
the
house
of
commons
fox
asserted
that
the
rupture
of
the
trace
of
amiens
had
its
origin
in
certain
essays
which
had
appeared
in
the
morning
post
and
which
were
known
to
have
proceeded
from
the
pen
of
coleridge
but
fox
added
an
ungenerous
and
malicious
hint
that
the
writer
was
at
rome
within
the
reach
of
bonaparte
the
information
reached
the
ears
for
which
it
was
uttered
and
an
order
was
sent
from
paris
to
compass
the
arrest
of
coleridge
it
was
in
the
year
when
the
poet
was
making
a
tour
in
italy
the
news
reached
him
at
naples
through
a
brother
of
the
illustrious
humboldt
as
gillman
says
or
in
a
friendly
warning
from
prince
jerome
bonaparte
as
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
cottle
and
the
pope
appears
to
have
been
reluctant
to
have
a
hand
in
the
business
and
in
fact
to
have
furnished
him
with
a
passport
if
not
with
a
carriage
for
flight
coleridge
eventually
got
to
leghorn
where
he
got
a
passage
by
an
american
ship
bound
for
england
but
his
escape
coming
to
the
ears
of
bonaparte
a
was
kept
for
the
ship
and
she
was
chased
by
a
french
cruiser
which
threw
the
captain
into
such
a
state
of
terror
that
he
made
coleridge
throw
all
his
journals
and
papers
overboard
andrews
history
of

vol
ii
p
i
have
often
heard
him
say
were
i
to
slacken
the
reins
i
should
not
continue
three
months
in
power
he
unfortunately
held
the
same
opinion
respecting
every
other
prerogative
of
public
freedom
the
silence
he
had
imposed
in
france
he
wished
if
he
could
to
impose
in
england
he
was
irritated
by
the
calumnies
and
libels
so
liberally
cast
upon
him
by
the
english
journals
and
especially
by
one
written
in
french
called
conducted
by
peltier
who
had
been
the
editor
of
the
des
apotres
in
paris
the
was
constantly
teeming
with
the
moat
violent
attacks
on
the
first
consul
and
the
french
nation
bonaparte
could
never
like
the
english
bring
himself
to
despise
newspaper
libels
and
he
revenged
himself
by
violent
articles
which
he
caused
to
be
inserted
in
the
he
directed
otto
to
remonstrate
in
an
official
note
against
a
system
of
calumny
which
he
believed
to
be
authorised
by
the
english
government
besides
this
official
proceeding
he
applied
personally
to
addington
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
requesting
him
to
procure
the
adoption
of
legislative
measures
against
the
licentious
writings
complained
of
and
to
take
the
earliest
opportunity
of
satisfying
his
hatred
against
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
first
consul
seized
the
moment
of
signing
the
preliminaries
to
make
this
request
addington
wrote
a
long
answer
to
the
first
consul
which
i
translated
for
him
the
english
minister
refuted
with
great
force
all
the
arguments
which
bonaparte
had
employed
against
the
press
he
also
informed
the
first
consul
that
though
a
foreigner
it
was
competent
in
him
to
institute
a
complaint
in
the
courts
of
law
but
that
in
such
case
he
must
be
content
to
see
all
the
scandalous
statements
of
which
he
complained
republished
in
the
report
of
the
trial
he
advised
him
to
treat
the
libels
with
profound
contempt
and
do
as
he
and
others
did
who
attached
not
the
slightest
importance
to
them
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
in
some
degree
prevented
a
trial
taking
place
at
that
time
things
remained
in
this
state
for
the
moment
but
after
the
peace
of
amiens
the
first
consul
prosecuted
pettier
whose
journal
was
always
full
of
violence
and
bitterness
against
him
pettier
was
defended
by
the
celebrated
mackintosh
who
according
to
the
accounts
of
the
time
displayed
great
eloquence
on
this
occasion
yet
in
spite
of
the
ability
of
his
counsel
he
was
convicted
the
verdict
which
public
opinion
considered
in
the
light
of
a
triumph
for
the
defendant
was
not
followed
up
by
any
judgment
in
consequence
of
the
rupture
of
the
peace
occurring
soon
after
it
is
melancholy
to
reflect
that
this
nervous
susceptibility
to
the
libels
of
the
english
papers
contributed
certainly
as
much
as
and
perhaps
more
than
the
consideration
of
great
political
interests
to
the
renewal
of
hostilities
the
public
would
be
astonished
at
a
great
many
things
if
they
could
only
look
under
the
cards
i
have
anticipated
the
rupture
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
that
i
might
not
interrupt
what
i
had
to
mention
respecting
bonaparte
hatred
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
i
now
return
to
the
end
of
the
year
the
period
of
the
expedition
against
domingo
the
first
consul
after
dictating
to
me
during
nearly
the
whole
of
one
night
instructions
for
that
expedition
sent
for
general
leclerc
and
said
to
him
in
my
presence
here
take
your
instructions
you
have
a
fine
opportunity
for
filling
your
purse
go
and
no
longer
tease
me
with
your
eternal
requests
for
money
the
friendship
which
bonaparte
felt
for
his
sister
pauline
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
in
inducing
him
to
take
this
liberal
way
of
enriching
her
husband
the
expedition
left
the
ports
of
france
on
the
of
december
and
arrived
off
cape
domingo
on
the
of
february
the
fatal
result
of
the
enterprise
is
well
known
but
we
are
never
to
be
cured
of
the
folly
of
such
absurd
expeditions
in
the
instructions
given
to
leclerc
everything
was
foreseen
but
it
was
painful
to
know
that
the
choice
of
one
of
the
youngest
and
least
capable
of
all
the
generals
of
the
army
left
no
hope
of
a
successful
result
the
expedition
to
domingo
was
one
of
bonaparte
great
errors
almost
every
person
whom
he
consulted
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
it
he
attempted
a
justification
through
the
medium
of
his
historians
of
helena
but
does
he
succeed
when
he
says
that
he
was
obliged
to
yield
to
the
advice
of
his
council
of
state
he
truly
was
a
likely
man
to
submit
a
question
of
war
to
the
discussion
of
the
council
of
state
or
to
be
guided
in
such
an
affair
by
any
council
we
must
believe
that
no
other
motive
influenced
the
first
consul
but
the
wish
by
giving
him
the
means
of
enriching
himself
to
get
rid
of
a
who
had
the
gift
of
specially
annoying
him
the
first
consul
who
did
not
really
much
like
this
expedition
should
have
perhaps
reflected
longer
on
the
difficulties
of
attempting
to
subdue
the
colony
by
force
he
was
shaken
by
this
argument
which
i
often
repeated
to
him
and
he
agreed
with
it
but
the
inconceivable
influence
which
the
members
of
his
family
exercised
on
him
always
overcame
him
bonaparte
dictated
to
me
a
letter
for
toussaint
full
of
sounding
words
and
fine
promises
informing
him
that
his
two
children
who
had
been
educated
in
paris
were
sent
back
to
him
offering
him
the
title
of
governor
and
stating
that
he
ought
readily
to
assist
in
an
arrangement
which
would
contribute
to
reconnect
the
colony
with
the
toussaint
who
had
at
first
shown
a
disposition
to
close
with
the
bargain
yet
feeling
afraid
of
being
deceived
by
the
french
and
probably
induced
by
ambitious
motives
resolved
on
war
he
displayed
a
great
deal
of
talent
but
being
attacked
before
the
climate
had
thinned
the
french
ranks
he
was
unable
to
oppose
a
fresh
army
numerous
and
inured
to
war
he
capitulated
and
retired
to
a
plantation
which
he
was
not
to
leave
without
leclerc
permission
a
feigned
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
blacks
formed
a
pretence
for
accusing
toussaint
and
he
was
seized
and
sent
to
france
toussaint
was
brought
to
pains
in
the
beginning
of
august
he
was
sent
in
the
first
instance
to
the
temple
whence
he
was
removed
to
the
chateau
de
joux
his
imprisonment
was
rigorous
few
comforts
were
allowed
him
this
treatment
his
recollection
of
the
past
his
separation
from
the
world
and
the
effects
of
a
strange
climate
accelerated
his
death
which
took
place
a
few
months
after
his
arrival
in
france
the
reports
which
spread
concerning
his
death
the
assertion
that
it
was
not
a
natural
one
and
that
it
had
been
caused
by
poison
obtained
no
credit
i
should
add
that
toussaint
wrote
a
letter
to
bonaparte
but
i
never
saw
in
it
the
expression
attributed
to
him
the
first
man
of
the
blacks
to
the
first
man
of
the
whites
bonaparte
acknowledged
that
the
black
leader
possessed
energy
courage
and
great
skill
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
rejoiced
if
the
result
of
his
relations
with
domingo
had
been
something
else
than
the
kidnaping
and
transportation
of
toussaint
leclerc
after
fruitless
efforts
to
conquer
the
colony
was
himself
carried
off
by
the
yellow
fever
rochambeau
succeeded
him
by
right
of
seniority
and
was
as
unsuccessful
as
menou
had
been
in
egypt
the
submission
of
the
blacks
which
could
only
have
been
obtained
by
conciliation
he
endeavoured
to
compel
by
violence
at
last
in
december
he
surrendered
to
an
english
squadron
and
abandoned
the
island
to
dessalines
bonaparte
often
experienced
severe
bodily
pain
and
i
have
now
little
doubt
from
the
nature
of
his
sufferings
that
they
were
occasioned
by
the
commencement
of
that
malady
which
terminated
his
life
at
helena
these
pains
of
which
he
frequently
complained
affected
him
most
acutely
on
the
night
when
he
dictated
to
me
the
instructions
for
general
leclerc
it
was
very
late
when
i
conducted
him
to
his
apartment
we
had
just
been
taking
a
cup
of
chocolate
a
beverage
of
which
we
always
partook
when
our
business
lasted
longer
than
one
in
the
morning
he
never
took
a
light
with
him
when
he
went
up
to
his
bedroom
i
gave
him
my
arm
and
we
had
scarcely
got
beyond
the
little
staircase
which
leads
to
the
corridor
when
he
was
rudely
run
against
by
a
man
who
was
endeavouring
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
by
the
staircase
the
first
consul
did
not
fall
because
i
supported
him
we
soon
gained
his
chamber
where
we
found
josephine
who
having
heard
the
noise
awoke
greatly
alarmed
from
the
investigations
which
were
immediately
made
it
appeared
that
the
uproar
was
occasioned
by
a
fellow
who
had
been
keeping
an
assignation
and
had
exceeded
the
usual
hour
for
his
departure
on
the
of
january
mademoiselle
hortense
was
married
to
louis
bonaparte
as
the
custom
was
not
yet
resumed
of
adding
the
religious
ceremony
to
the
civil
contract
the
nuptial
benediction
was
on
this
occasion
privately
given
by
a
priest
at
the
house
rue
de
la
victoire
bonaparte
also
caused
the
marriage
of
his
sister
caroline
the
wife
of
murat
and
the
cleverest
of
bonaparte
sisters
which
had
taken
place
two
years
earlier
before
a
mayor
to
be
consecrated
in
the
same
manner
but
he
and
his
wife
did
not
follow
the
example
had
he
already
then
an
idea
of
separating
from
josephine
and
therefore
an
unwillingness
to
render
a
divorce
more
difficult
by
giving
his
marriage
a
religious
sanction
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
from
what
he
said
to
me
that
his
neglecting
to
take
a
part
in
the
religious
ceremony
arose
from
indifference
bonaparte
said
at
helena
speaking
of
louis
and
hortense
that
they
loved
each
other
when
they
married
they
desired
to
be
united
the
marriage
was
also
the
result
of
josephine
intrigues
who
found
her
account
in
it
i
will
state
the
real
facts
louis
and
hortense
did
not
love
one
another
at
all
that
is
certain
the
first
consul
knew
it
just
as
he
well
knew
that
hortense
had
a
great
inclination
for
duroc
who
did
not
fully
return
it
the
first
consul
agreed
to
their
union
but
josephine
was
troubled
by
such
a
marriage
and
did
all
she
could
to
prevent
it
she
often
spoke
to
me
about
it
but
rather
late
in
the
day
she
told
me
that
her
law
were
her
declared
enemies
that
i
well
knew
their
intrigues
and
that
i
well
knew
there
was
no
end
to
the
annoyances
they
made
her
undergo
in
fact
i
did
know
all
this
perfectly
she
kept
on
repeating
to
me
that
with
this
projected
marriage
she
would
not
have
any
support
that
duroc
was
nothing
except
by
the
favour
of
bonaparte
that
he
had
neither
fortune
fame
nor
reputation
and
that
he
could
be
no
help
to
her
against
the
of
the
brothers
of
bonaparte
she
wanted
some
assurance
for
the
future
she
added
that
her
husband
was
very
fond
of
louis
and
that
if
she
had
the
good
fortune
to
unite
him
to
her
daughter
this
would
be
a
counterpoise
to
the
calumnies
and
persecutions
of
her
other
law
i
answered
her
that
she
had
concealed
her
intentions
too
long
from
me
and
that
i
had
promised
my
services
to
the
young
people
and
the
more
willingly
as
i
knew
the
favourable
opinion
of
the
first
consul
who
had
often
said
to
me
my
wife
has
done
well
they
suit
one
another
they
shall
marry
one
another
i
like
duroc
he
is
of
good
family
i
have
rightly
given
caroline
to
murat
and
pauline
to
leclerc
and
i
can
well
give
hortense
to
duroc
who
is
a
fine
fellow
he
is
worth
more
than
the
others
he
is
now
general
of
a
division
there
is
nothing
against
this
marriage
besides
i
have
other
plans
for
louis
in
speaking
to
madame
bonaparte
i
added
that
her
daughter
burst
into
tears
when
spoken
to
about
her
marriage
with
louis
the
first
consul
had
sent
a
brevet
of
general
of
division
to
duroc
by
a
special
courier
who
went
to
holland
through
which
the
general
had
to
pass
on
his
return
from
petersburg
where
as
i
have
already
said
he
had
been
sent
to
compliment
the
emperor
alexander
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
the
first
consul
probably
paid
this
compliment
to
duroc
in
the
belief
that
the
marriage
would
take
place
during
duroc
absence
the
correspondence
of
the
lovers
passed
by
their
consent
through
my
hands
every
night
i
used
to
make
one
in
a
party
at
billiards
at
which
hortense
played
very
well
when
i
told
her
in
a
whisper
that
i
had
got
a
letter
for
her
she
would
immediately
leave
off
playing
and
run
to
her
chamber
where
i
followed
and
gave
her
epistle
when
she
opened
it
her
eyes
would
fill
with
tears
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
return
to
the
salon
all
was
useless
for
her
josephine
required
a
support
in
the
family
against
the
family
seeing
her
firm
resolution
i
promised
to
no
longer
oppose
her
wishes
which
i
could
not
disapprove
but
i
told
her
i
could
only
maintain
silence
and
neutrality
in
these
little
debates
and
she
seemed
satisfied
when
we
were
at
malmaison
those
intrigues
continued
at
the
tuileries
the
same
conduct
was
pursued
but
then
the
probability
of
success
was
on
duroc
side
i
even
congratulated
him
on
his
prospects
but
he
received
my
compliments
in
a
very
cold
manner
in
a
few
days
after
josephine
succeeded
in
changing
the
whole
face
of
affairs
her
heart
was
entirely
set
on
the
marriage
of
louis
with
her
daughter
and
prayers
entreaties
caresses
and
all
those
little
arts
which
she
so
well
knew
how
to
use
were
employed
to
win
the
first
consul
to
her
purpose
on
the
of
january
the
first
consul
after
dinner
entered
our
cabinet
where
i
was
employed
where
is
duroc
he
he
has
gone
to
the
opera
i
believe
tell
him
as
soon
as
he
returns
that
i
have
promised
hortense
to
him
and
he
shall
have
her
but
i
wish
the
marriage
to
take
place
in
two
days
at
the
latest
i
will
give
him
francs
and
name
him
commandant
of
the
eighth
military
division
but
he
must
set
out
the
day
after
his
marriage
with
his
wife
for
toulon
we
must
live
apart
i
want
no
at
home
as
i
wish
to
come
to
some
conclusion
let
me
know
whether
this
plan
will
satisfy
him
i
think
it
will
not
very
well
then
she
shall
marry
louis
will
she
like
that
she
must
like
it
bonaparte
gave
me
these
directions
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
which
made
me
think
that
some
little
domestic
warfare
had
been
raging
and
that
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
had
come
to
propose
his
ultimatum
at
ten
in
the
evening
duroc
returned
i
reported
to
him
word
for
word
the
proposition
of
the
first
consul
since
it
has
come
to
that
my
good
friend
said
he
tell
him
he
may
keep
his
daughter
for
me
i
am
going
to
see
the
and
with
an
indifference
for
which
i
can
not
account
he
took
his
hat
and
went
off
duroc
eventually
married
a
mademoiselle
hervae
the
daughter
of
a
spanish
banker
who
was
later
minister
of
joseph
and
was
created
marquis
of
abruenara
the
lady
was
neither
handsome
nor
amiable
but
she
possessed
a
vast
fortune
and
bonaparte
himself
solicited
her
hand
for
his
aide
de
camp
after
the
death
of
duroc
his
widow
married
a
fabvier
and
napoleon
gave
his
duchy
of
frioul
to
his
daughter
the
first
consul
before
going
to
bed
was
informed
of
duroc
reply
and
josephine
received
from
him
the
promise
that
louis
and
hortense
should
be
married
the
marriage
took
place
a
few
days
after
to
the
great
regret
of
hortense
and
probably
to
the
satisfaction
of
duroc
louis
submitted
to
have
forced
on
him
as
a
wife
a
woman
who
had
hitherto
avoided
him
as
much
as
possible
she
always
manifested
as
much
indifference
for
him
as
he
displayed
repugnance
for
her
and
those
sentiments
have
not
been
effaced
the
marriage
of
louis
bonaparte
took
place
on
the
january
the
bride
and
bridegroom
were
exceedingly
dull
and
mademoiselle
hortense
wept
daring
the
whole
of
the
ceremony
josephine
knowing
that
this
union
which
commenced
so
inauspiciously
was
her
own
work
anxiously
endeavoured
to
establish
a
more
cordial
feeling
between
her
daughter
and
but
all
her
efforts
were
vain
and
the
marriage
proved
a
very
unhappy
one
memoirs
de
constant
napoleon
iii
was
the
son
of
the
queen
of
holland
hortense
beauharnais
napoleon
said
at
helena
that
he
wished
to
unite
louis
with
a
niece
of
talleyrand
i
can
only
say
that
i
never
heard
a
word
of
this
niece
either
from
himself
his
wife
or
his
daughter
and
i
rather
think
that
at
that
time
the
first
consul
was
looking
after
a
royal
alliance
for
louis
he
often
expressed
regret
at
the
precipitate
marriages
of
his
sisters
it
should
be
recollected
that
we
were
now
in
the
year
which
saw
the
consulship
for
life
established
and
which
consequently
gave
presage
of
the
empire
napoleon
said
truly
to
the
companions
of
his
exile
that
louis
marriage
was
the
result
of
josephine
intrigues
but
i
can
not
understand
how
he
never
mentioned
the
intention
he
once
had
of
uniting
hortense
to
duroc
it
has
been
erroneously
stated
that
the
first
consul
believed
that
he
reconciled
the
happiness
of
his
daughter
with
his
policy
hortense
did
not
love
louis
and
dreaded
this
marriage
there
was
no
hope
of
happiness
for
her
and
the
event
has
proved
this
as
for
the
policy
of
the
first
consul
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
it
was
concerned
with
the
marriage
of
louis
to
hortense
and
in
any
case
the
grand
policy
which
professed
so
loudly
to
be
free
from
all
feminine
influences
would
have
been
powerless
against
the
intrigues
of
josephine
for
at
this
time
at
the
tuileries
the
boudoir
was
often
stronger
than
the
cabinet
here
i
am
happy
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
contradict
most
formally
and
most
positively
certain
infamous
insinuations
which
have
prevailed
respecting
bonaparte
and
hortense
those
who
have
asserted
that
bonaparte
ever
entertained
towards
hortense
any
other
sentiments
than
those
of
a
for
a
have
as
the
ancient
knights
used
to
say
lied
in
their
throats
we
shall
see
farther
on
what
he
said
to
me
on
this
subject
but
it
is
never
too
soon
to
destroy
such
a
base
calumny
authors
unworthy
of
belief
have
stated
without
any
proof
that
not
only
was
there
this
criminal
liaison
but
they
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
bonaparte
was
the
father
of
the
eldest
son
of
hortense
it
is
a
lie
a
vile
lie
and
yet
the
rumour
has
spread
through
all
france
and
all
europe
alas
has
calumny
such
powerful
charms
that
once
they
are
submitted
to
their
yoke
can
not
be
broken
bourrienne
account
of
this
marriage
and
his
denial
of
the
vile
calumny
about
napoleon
is
corroborated
by
madame
remusat
after
saying
that
hortense
had
refused
to
marry
the
son
of
rewbell
and
also
the
comte
de
nun
she
goes
on
a
short
time
afterwards
duroc
then
aide
de
camp
to
the
consul
and
already
noted
by
him
fell
in
love
with
hortense
she
returned
the
feeling
and
believed
she
had
found
that
other
half
of
herself
which
she
sought
bonaparte
looked
favourably
on
their
union
but
madame
bonaparte
in
her
turn
was
inflexible
daughter
said
she
marry
s
gentleman
or
a
bonaparte
louis
was
then
thought
of
he
had
no
fancy
for
hortense
defeated
the
beauharnais
family
and
had
a
supreme
contempt
for
his
but
as
he
was
silent
he
was
believed
to
be
gentle
and
as
he
was
severe
by
character
he
was
believed
to
be
upright
madame
louis
told
me
afterwards
that
at
the
news
of
this
arrangement
she
experienced
violent
grief
not
only
was
she
forbidden
to
think
of
the
man
she
loved
but
she
was
about
to
be
given
to
another
of
whom
she
had
a
secret
distrust

for
the
cruel
treatment
of
hortense
by
louis
see
the
succeeding
pages
of
remusat
as
for
the
vile
scandal
about
hortense
and
napoleon
there
is
little
doubt
that
it
was
spread
by
the
bonapartist
family
for
interested
motives
madame
louis
became
enceinte
soon
after
her
marriage
the
bonapartists
and
especially
madame
murat
caroline
had
disliked
this
marriage
because
joseph
having
only
daughters
it
was
forseen
that
the
first
son
of
louis
and
the
grandson
of
madame
bonaparte
would
be
the
object
of
great
interest
they
therefore
spread
the
revolting
story
that
this
was
the
result
of
a
connection
of
the
first
consul
with
his
law
encouraged
by
the
mother
herself
public
willingly
believed
this
suspicion
madame
murat
told
louis
etc
remusat
tome
i
this
last
sentence
is
corroborated
by
miot
de
melito
tome
ii
who
speaking
of
the
later
proposal
of
napoleon
to
adopt
this
child
says
that
louis
remembered
the
damaging
stories
which
had
tried
to
spread
among
the
public
concerning
hortense
beauharnais
before
be
married
her
and
although
a
comparison
of
the
date
of
his
marriage
with
that
of
the
birth
of
his
son
must
have
shown
him
that
these
tales
were
unfounded
he
felt
that
they
world
be
revived
by
the
adoption
of
this
child
by
the
first
consul
thus
this
wretched
story
did
harm
in
every
way
the
conduct
of
josephine

be
judged
with
leniency
engaged
as
she
was
in
a
desperate
straggle
to
maintain
her
own
marriage
a
struggle
she
kept
up
with
great
skill
see

she
baffled
all
the
calculations
all
the
manoeuvres
of

adversaries
but
she
was
foolish
enough
to
talk
in
her
anger

bonaparte
was
anxious

republic
on
a
footing
of
harmony
with
the
government
of
france
it
was
necessary
to
select
a
president
who
should
perfectly
agree
with
bonaparte
views
and
in
this
respect
no
one
could
be
so
suitable
as
bonaparte
himself
the
two
presidencies
united
would
serve
as
a
transition
to
the
throne
not
wishing
to
be
long
absent
from
paris
and
anxious
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
the
journey
to
milan
he
arranged
to
meet
the
deputation
at
lyons
before
our
departure
i
said
to
him
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
wish
to
revisit
italy
the
first
scene
of
your
glory
and
the
beautiful
capital
of
lombardy
where
you
were
the
object
of
so
much
homage
i
certainly
should
replied
the
first
consul
but
the
journey
to
milan
would
occupy
too
much
precious
time
i
prefer
that
the
meeting
should
take
place
in
france
my
influence
over
the
deputies
will
be
more
prompt
and
certain
at
lyons
than
at
milan
and
then
i
should
be
glad
to
see
the
noble
wreck
of
the
army
of
egypt
which
is
collected
at
lyons
on
the
of
january
we
set
out
bonaparte
who
was
now
ready
to
ascend
the
throne
of
france
wished
to
prepare
the
italians
for
one
day
crowning
him
king
of
italy
in
imitation
of
charlemagne
of
whom
in
anticipation
he
considered
himself
the
successor
he
saw
that
the
title
of
president
of
the
cisalpine
republic
was
a
great
advance
towards
the
sovereignty
of
lombardy
as
he
afterwards
found
that
the
consulate
for
life
was
a
decisive
step
towards
the
throne
of
france
he
obtained
the
title
of
president
without
much
difficulty
on
the
of
january
the
journey
to
lyons
and
the
conferences
were
only
matters
of
form
but
high
sounding
words
and
solemn
proceedings
were
required
for
the
public
mind
the
attempts
which
had
been
made
on
the
life
of
the
first
consul
gave
rise
to
a
report
that
be
took
extraordinary
precautions
for
his
safety
during
this
journey
to
lyons
i
never
saw
those
precautions
and
bonaparte
was
at
all
times
averse
to
adopt
any
he
often
repeated
that
whoever
would
risk
his
own
life
might
take
his
it
is
not
true
that
guards
preceded
his
carriage
and
watched
the
roads
the
consul
travelled
like
a
private
person
and
very
rarely
had
arms
in
his
carriage
bonaparte
may
have
been
careless
of
his
own
safety
but
that
he
took
great
pains
in
regard
to
his
brother
may
be
inferred
from
the
following
letter
written
a
few
years
later
take
care
that
your
valets
de
chambre
your
cooks
the
guards
that
sleep
in
your
apartments
and
those
who
come
during
the
night
to
awaken
you
with
despatches
are
all
frenchmen
no
one
should
enter
your
room
during
the
night
except
your
aides
de
camp
who
should
sleep
in
the
chamber
that
precedes
your
bedroom
your
door
should
be
fastened
inside
and
you
ought
not
to
open
it
even
to
your
aide
de
camp
until
you
have
recognised
his
voice
he
himself
should
not
knock
at
your
door
until
he
has
locked
that
of
the
room
which
he
is
in
to
make
sure
of
being
alone
and
of
being
followed
by
no
one
these
precautions
are
important
they
give
no
trouble
and
they
inspire
confidence
besides
they
may
really
save
your
life
you
should
establish
these
habits
immediately
end
permanently
you
ought
not
to
be
obliged
to
have
resource
to
them
on
some
emergency
which
would
hurt
the
feelings
of
those
around
you
do
not
trust
only
to
your
own
experience
the
neapolitan
character
has
been
violent
in
every
age
and
you
have
to
do
with
a
woman
queen
of
naples
who
is
the
impersonation
of
crime
napoleon
to
joseph
may
du
casse
tome
ii
p
at
this
time
when
the
ambition
of
bonaparte
every
day
took
a
farther
flight
general
clarke
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
into
the
box
of
the
first
consul
at
the
francais
and
to
place
himself
in
the
front
seat
by
chance
the
first
consul
came
to
the
theatre
but
clarke
hardly
rising
did
not
give
up
his
place
the
first
consul
only
stayed
a
short
time
and
when
he
came
back
he
showed
great
discontent
at
this
affectation
of
pride
and
of
vanity
wishing
to
get
rid
of
a
man
whom
he
looked
on
as
a
blundering
flatterer
and
a
clumsy
critic
he
sent
him
away
as
charge
to
the
young
extemporized
king
of
etruria
where
clarke
expiated
his
folly
in
a
sort
of
exile
this
is
all
the
great
disfavour
which
has
been
so
much
spoken
about
in
the
end
general
clarke
returned
to
favour
berlin
knows
and
regrets
it
on
the
of
march
of
the
same
year
england
signed
at
amiens
a
suspension
of
arms
for
fourteen
months
which
was
called
a
treaty
of
peace
the
clauses
of
this
treaty
were
not
calculated
to
inspire
the
hope
of
a
very
long
peace
it
was
evident
as
i
have
already
said
that
england
would
not
evacuate
malta
and
that
island
ultimately
proved
the
chief
cause
of
the
rupture
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
but
england
heretofore
so
haughty
in
her
bearing
to
the
first
consul
had
at
length
treated
with
him
as
the
head
of
the
french
government
this
as
bonaparte
was
aware
boded
well
for
the
consolidation
of
his
power
at
that
time
when
he
saw
his
glory
and
power
augmenting
he
said
to
me
in
one
of
our
walks
at
malmaison
in
a
moment
of
hilarity
and
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
well
bourrienne
you
also
will
be
immortal
why
general
are
you
not
my
secretary
tell
me
the
name
of
alexander
said
i
bonaparte
did
not
know
the
name
of
alexander
secretary
and
i
forgot
at
the
moment
to
tell
him
it
was
clallisthenes
he
wrote
alexander
memoirs
as
i
am
writing
bonaparte
but
notwithstanding
this
coincidence
i
neither
expect
nor
desire
the
immortality
of
my
bourrienne
bonaparte
then
turned
to
me
and
laughing
said
hem
that
is
not
bad
there
was
to
be
sure
a
little
flattery
conveyed
in
my
question
but
that
never
displeased
him
and
i
certainly
did
not
in
that
instance
deserve
the
censure
he
often
bestowed
on
me
for
not
being
enough
of
a
courtier
and
flatterer
madame
murat
gave
a
grand
fete
in
honour
of
bonaparte
at
her
residence
at
neuilly
at
dinner
bonaparte
sat
opposite
madame
murat
at
the
principal
table
which
was
appropriated
to
the
ladies
he
ate
fast
and
talked
but
little
however
when
the
dessert
was
served
he
put
a
question
to
each
lady
this
question
was
to
inquire
their
respective
ages
when
madame
bourrienne
turn
came
he
said
to
her
oh
i
know
yours
this
was
a
great
deal
for
his
gallantry
and
the
other
ladies
were
far
from
being
pleased
at
it
next
day
while
walking
with
me
in
his
favourite
alley
at
malmaison
he
received
one
of
those
stupid
reports
of
the
police
which
were
so
frequently
addressed
to
him
it
mentioned
the
observations
which
had
been
made
in
paris
about
a
green
livery
he
had
lately
adopted
some
said
that
green
had
been
chosen
because
it
was
the
colour
of
the
house
of
artois
on
reading
that
a
slight
sneer
was
observable
in
his
countenance
and
he
said
what
are
these
idiots
dreaming
of
they
must
be
joking
surely
am
i
no
better
than
they
shall
soon
see
the
difference
until
the
middle
of
the
year
the
erasures
from
the
emigrant
list
had
always
been
proposed
by
the
minister
of
police
the
first
consul
having
been
informed
that
intrigue
and
even
bribery
had
been
employed
to
obtain
them
determined
that
in
future
erasures
should
be
part
of
the
business
of
his
cabinet
but
other
affairs
took
up
his
attention
and
a
dozen
or
fifteen
erasures
a
week
were
the
most
that
were
made
after
te
deum
had
been
chanted
at
malmaison
for
the
concordat
and
the
peace
i
took
advantage
of
that
moment
of
general
joy
to
propose
to
bonaparte
the
return
of
the
whole
body
of
emigrants
you
have
said
i
in
a
joking
way
reconciled
frenchmen
to
god
now
reconcile
them
to
each
other
there
have
never
been
any
real
emigrants
only
absentees
and
the
proof
of
this
is
that
erasures
from
the
list
have
always
been
and
will
always
be
made
daily
he
immediately
seized
the
idea
we
shall
see
said
he
but
i
must
except
a
thousand
persons
belonging
to
high
families
especially
those
who
are
or
have
been
connected
with
royalty
or
the
court
i
said
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
i
feel
pleasure
in
repeating
here
that
the
plan
of
the
which
bonaparte
dictated
to
me
excepted
from
restitution
only
such
mansions
as
were
used
for
public
establishments
these
he
would
neither
surrender
nor
pay
rent
for
with
those
exceptions
he
was
willing
to
restore
almost
all
that
was
possessed
by
the
state
and
had
not
been
sold
the
first
consul
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
this
plan
of
a
decree
convoked
a
grand
council
to
submit
it
to
their
consideration
i
was
in
an
adjoining
room
to
that
in
which
they
met
and
as
the
deliberations
were
carried
on
with
great
warmth
the
members
talking
very
loudly
sometimes
even
vociferating
i
heard
all
that
passed
the
revolutionary
party
rejected
all
propositions
of
restitution
they
were
willing
to
call
back
their
victims
but
they
would
not
part
with
the
spoil
when
the
first
consul
returned
to
his
cabinet
dissatisfied
with
the
ill
success
of
his
project
i
took
the
liberty
of
saying
to
him
you
can
not
but
perceive
general
that
your
object
has
been
defeated
and
your
project
unsuccessful
the
refusal
to
restore
to
the
emigrants
all
that
the
state
possesses
takes
from
the
recall
all
its
generosity
and
dignity
of
character
i
wonder
how
you
could
yield
to
such
an
unreasonable
and
selfish
opposition
the
revolutionary
party
replied
he
had
the
majority
in
the
council
what
could
i
do
am
i
strong
enough
to
overcome
all
those
obstacles
general
you
can
revive
the
question
again
and
oppose
the
party
you
speak
of
that
would
be
difficult
he
said
they
still
have
a
high
hand
in
these
matters
time
is
required
however
nothing
is
definitively
arranged
we
shall
see
what
can
be
done
the
published
on
the
floreal
year
x
of
april
a
fortnight
after
the
above
conversation
took
place
is
well
known
bonaparte
was
then
obliged
to
yield
to
the
revolutionary
party
or
he
would
have
adhered
to
his
first
proposition
the
retained
the
woods
and
forests
of
the
emigrants
and
made
their
recall
an
amnesty
in
the
end
this
retention
of
the
forests
was
used
by
napoleon
with
great
dexterity
as
a
means
of
placing
them
under
personal
obligation
to
him
for
restoring
this
species
of
property
see
thiers
tome
iii
livre
xiv
napoleon
referred
to
this
matter
at
helena
he
himself
says
that
he
would
have
been
able
he
should
have
said
that
he
wished
to
grant
everything
that
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
doing
so
and
that
it
was
a
mistake
not
to
do
so
this
limitation
on
my
part
he
adds
destroyed
all
the
good
effect
of
the
return
of
the
emigrants
the
mistake
was
the
greater
since
i
thought
of
doing
it
but
i
was
alone
surrounded
by
oppositions
and
by
spies
all
were
against
your
party
you
can
not
easily
picture
the
matter
to
yourself
but
important
affairs
hurried
me
time
pressed
and
i
was
obliged
to
act
differently
afterwards
he
speaks
of
a
syndicate
he
wished
to
form
but
i
have
never
heard
a
word
of
that
i
have
said
how
things
really
happened
and
what
has
been
just
read
confirms
this
this
was
by
no
means
the
only
time
that
napoleon
wishes
were
opposed
successfully
in
his
council
of
state
on
such
occasions
he
used
to
describe
himself
as
repulsed
with
losses
see
the
interesting
work
of
hilaire
napoleon
au
conseil
the
royalists
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
political
affairs
were
not
better
pleased
with
the
illiberal
conditions
of
the
recall
of
the
emigrants
the
friends
of
public
liberty
on
the
other
hand
were
far
from
being
satisfied
with
the
other
acts
of
the
first
consul
or
with
the
conduct
of
the
different
public
authorities
who
were
always
ready
to
make
concessions
to
him
thus
all
parties
were
dissatisfied
bonaparte
was
much
pleased
with
general
sebastiani
conduct
when
he
was
sent
to
constantinople
after
the
peace
of
amiens
to
induce
the
grand
seignior
to
renew
amicable
relations
with
france
at
the
period
here
alluded
to
namely
before
the
news
of
the
evacuation
of
egypt
that
country
greatly
occupied
bonaparte
attention
he
thought
that
to
send
a
man
like
sebastiani
travelling
through
northern
africa
egypt
and
syria
might
inspire
the
sovereigns
of
those
countries
with
a
more
favourable
idea
of
france
than
they
now
entertained
and
might
remove
the
ill
impressions
which
england
was
endeavouring
to
produce
on
this
mission
sebastiani
was
accordingly
despatched
he
visited
all
the
barbary
states
egypt
palestine
and
the
ionian
isles
everywhere
he
drew
a
picture
of
the
power
of
bonaparte
and
depreciated
the
glory
of
england
this
general
or
count
sebastian
was
afterwards
ambassador
for
louis
philippe
at
our
court
he
strengthened
old
connections
and
contracted
new
ones
with
the
chiefs
of
each
country
he
declared
to
the
authorities
of
the
ionian
isles
that
they
might
rely
on
the
powerful
protection
of
france
bonaparte
in
my
opinion
expected
too
much
from
the
labours
of
a
single
individual
furnished
with
but
vague
instructions
still
sebastiani
did
all
that
could
be
done
the
interesting
details
of
his
proceedings
were
published
in
the
the
secret
information
respecting
the
means
of
successfully
attacking
the
english
establishments
in
india
was
very
curious
though
not
affording
the
hope
of
speedy
success
the
published
abstract
of
general
sebastiani
report
was
full
of
expressions
hostile
to
england
among
other
things
it
was
stated
that
egypt
might
be
conquered
with
men
and
that
the
ionian
isles
where
disposed
to
throw
off
the
yoke
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
this
publication
hastened
the
rupture
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
england
suspended
all
discussions
respecting
malta
and
declared
that
she
would
not
resume
them
till
the
king
of
great
britain
should
receive
satisfaction
for
what
was
called
an
act
of
hostility
this
was
always
put
forward
as
a
justification
good
or
bad
for
breaking
the
treaty
of
amiens
which
england
had
never
shown
herself
very
ready
to
execute
bonaparte
waiving
the
usual
forma
of
etiquette
expressed
his
wish
to
have
a
private
conference
with
lord
whitworth
the
ambassador
from
london
to
paris
and
who
had
been
the
english
ambassador
at
petersburg
previous
to
the
rupture
which
preceded
the
death
of
paul
bonaparte
counted
much
on
the
effect
he
might
produce
by
that
captivating
manner
which
he
so
well
knew
how
to
assume
in
conversation
but
all
was
in
vain
in
signing
the
treaty
of
amiens
the
british
minister
was
well
aware
that
he
would
be
the
first
to
break
it
about
the
commencement
of
the
year
napoleon
began
to
feel
acute
pains
in
his
right
side
i
have
often
seen
him
at
malmaison
when
sitting
up
at
night
lean
against
the
right
arm
of
his
chair
and
unbuttoning
his
coat
and
waistcoat
exclaim
what
pain
i
feel
i
would
then
accompany
him
to
his
bedchamber
and
have
often
been
obliged
to
support
him
on
the
little
staircase
which
led
from
his
cabinet
to
the
corridor
he
frequently
used
to
say
at
this
time
i
fear
that
when
i
am
forty
i
shall
become
a
great
eater
i
have
a
foreboding
that
i
shall
grow
very
corpulent
this
fear
of
obesity
though
it
annoyed
him
very
much
did
not
appear
to
have
the
least
foundation
judging
from
his
habitual
temperance
and
spare
habit
of
body
he
asked
me
who
was
my
physician
i
told
him
corvisart
whom
his
brother
louis
had
recommended
to
me
a
few
days
after
he
called
in
corvisart
who
three
years
later
was
appointed
first
physician
to
the
emperor
he
appeared
to
derive
much
benefit
from
the
prescriptions
of
corvisart
whose
open
and
countenance
at
once
made
a
favourable
impression
on
him
the
pain
which
the
first
consul
felt
at
this
time
increased
his
irritability
perhaps
many
of
the
sets
of
this
epoch
of
his
life
should
be
attributed
to
this
illness
at
the
time
in
question
his
ideas
were
not
the
same
in
the
evening
as
they
had
been
in
the
morning
and
often
in
the
morning
he
would
tear
up
even
without
the
least
remark
notes
he
had
dictated
to
me
at
night
and
which
he
had
considered
excellent
at
other
times
i
took
on
myself
not
to
send
to
the
moniteur
as
he
wished
me
to
do
notes
which
dictated
by
annoyance
and
irascibility
might
have
produced
a
bad
effect
in
europe
when
the
next
day
he
did
not
see
the
article
i
attributed
this
to
the
note
being
too
late
or
to
the
late
arrival
of
the
courier
but
i
told
him
it
was
no
loss
for
it
would
be
inserted
the
next
day
he
did
not
answer
at
once
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
he
said
to
me
do
not
send
my
note
to
the
without
showing
it
to
me
he
took
it
and
reread
it
sometimes
he
was
astonished
at
what
he
had
dictated
to
me
and
amused
himself
by
saying
that
i
had
not
understood
him
properly
that
is
not
much
good
is
it
my
word
i
do
quite
know
oh
no
it
is
worthless
what
say
you
then
he
bowed
his
head
a
little
and
tore
up
the
paper
once
when
we
were
at
the
tuileries
he
sent
me
at
two
in
the
morning
a
small
note
in
his
own
writing
in
which
was
to
bourrienne
write
to
maret
to
make
him
erase
from
the
note
which
fleurieu
has
read
to
the
tribunate
the
phrase
spelt
frase
concerning
costaz
and
to
soften
as
much
as
possible
what
concerns
the
reporter
of
the
tribunate
this
change
after
time
for
reflection
arose
as
often
happened
with
him
from
observations
i
had
made
to
him
and
which
he
had
at
first
angrily
repulsed
after
the
peace
of
amiens
the
first
consul
wishing
to
send
an
ambassador
to
england
cast
his
eyes
for
what
reason
i
know
not
on
general
andreossi
i
took
the
liberty
of
making
some
observation
on
a
choice
which
did
not
appear
to
me
to
correspond
with
the
importance
of
the
mission
bonaparte
replied
i
have
not
determined
on
it
i
will
talk
to
talleyrand
on
the
subject
when
we
were
at
malmaison
in
the
evening
de
talleyrand
came
to
transact
business
with
the
first
consul
the
proposed
appointment
of
an
ambassador
to
england
was
mentioned
after
several
persons
had
been
named
the
first
consul
said
i
believe
i
must
send
andreossi
de
talleyrand
who
was
not
much
pleased
with
the
choice
observed
in
a
dry
sarcastic
tone
you
must
send
andre
i
pray
who
is
this
andre
i
did
not
mention
any
andre
i
said
andreossi
you
know
andreossi
the
general
of
artillery
ah
true
andreossi
i
did
not
think
of
him
i
was
thinking
only
of
the
diplomatic
men
and
did
not
recollect
any
of
that
name
yes
yes
andreossi
is
in
the
artillery
the
general
was
appointed
ambassador
and
went
to
london
after
the
treaty
of
amiens
but
he
returned
again
in
a
few
months
he
had
nothing
of
consequence
to
do
which
was
very
lucky
for
him
in
jerome
was
at
brest
in
the
rank
of
de
vaisseau
a
rank
in
the
navy
equivalent
to
that
of
our
lieutenant
he
launched
into
expenses
far
beyond
what
his
fortune
or
his
pay
could
maintain
he
often
drew
upon
me
for
sums
of
money
which
the
first
consul
paid
with
much
unwillingness
one
of
his
letters
in
particular
excited
anger
the
epistle
was
filled
with
accounts
of
the
entertainments
jerome
was
giving
and
receiving
and
ended
by
stating
that
he
should
draw
on
me
for
francs
to
this
bonaparte
wrote
the
following
reply
i
have
read
your
letter
monsieur
de
vaisseau
and
i
am
waiting
to
hear
that
you
are
studying
on
board
your
corvette
a
profession
which
you
ought
to
consider
as
your
road
to
glory
die
young
and
i
shall
have
some
consolatory
reflection
but
if
you
live
to
sixty
without
having
served
your
country
and
without
leaving
behind
you
any
honourable
recollections
you
had
better
not
have
lived
at
all
jerome
never
fulfilled
the
wishes
of
his
brother
who
always
called
him
a
little
profligate
from
his
earliest
years
his
conduct
was
often
a
source
of
vexation
to
his
brother
and
his
family
westphalia
will
not
soon
forget
that
he
was
her
king
and
his
subjects
did
not
without
reason
surname
him
heliogabalus
in
miniature
the
first
consul
was
harassed
by
the
continual
demands
for
money
made
on
him
by
his
brothers
to
get
rid
of
joseph
who
expended
large
sums
at
mortfontaine
as
lucien
did
at
neuilly
he
gave
collot
the
contract
for
victualling
the
navy
on
the
condition
of
his
paying
joseph
francs
a
year
out
of
his
profits
i
believe
this
arrangement
answered
joseph
purpose
very
well
but
it
was
anything
but
advantageous
to
collot
i
think
a
whole
year
elapsed
without
his
pocketing
a
single
farthing
he
obtained
an
audience
of
the
first
consul
to
whom
he
stated
his
grievances
his
outlays
he
showed
were
enormous
and
he
could
get
no
payment
from
the
navy
office
upon
which
the
consul
angrily
interrupted
him
saying
do
you
think
i
am
a
mere
capuchin
decres
must
have
crowns
duroc
bourrienne
you
must
make
the
payments
and
do
come
here
troubling
me
with
your
long
stories
it
is
the
business
of
my
ministers
to
give
me
accounts
of
such
matters
i
will
hear
decres
and
that
enough
let
me
be
teased
no
longer
with
these
complaints
i
can
not
attend
to
them
bonaparte
then
very
unceremoniously
dismissed
collot
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
did
not
get
a
settlement
of
the
business
until
after
a
great
deal
of
trouble
collot
once
said
to
me
if
he
had
asked
me
for
as
much
money
as
would
have
built
a
frigate
he
should
have
had
it
all
i
want
now
is
to
be
paid
and
to
get
rid
of
the
business
collot
had
reason
and
honour
on
his
side
but
there
was
nothing
but
shuffling
on
