granthan
mission
was
the
most
vital
of
the
war
it
would
mean
instant
victory
but
for
whom
i
in
the
dream
i
was
swimming
in
a
river
of
white
fire
and
the
dream
went
on
and
on
and
then
i
was
awake
and
the
fire
was
still
there
fiercely
burning
at
me
i
tried
to
move
to
get
away
from
the
flames
and
then
the
real
pain
hit
me
i
tried
to
go
back
to
sleep
and
the
relative
comfort
of
the
river
of
fire
but
it
was
no
go
for
better
or
worse
i
was
alive
and
conscious
i
opened
my
eyes
and
took
a
look
around
i
was
on
the
floor
next
to
an
unpadded
acceleration
couch
the
kind
the
terrestrial
space
arm
installs
in
lifeboats
there
were
three
more
couches
but
no
one
in
them
i
tried
to
sit
up
it
was
easy
but
by
applying
a
lot
more
than
should
be
required
of
a
sick
man
i
made
it
i
took
a
look
at
my
left
arm
baked
the
hand
was
only
medium
rare
but
the
forearm
was
black
with
deep
red
showing
at
the
bottom
of
the
cracks
where
the
crisped
upper
layers
had
burst
there
was
a
cabinet
across
the
compartment
from
me
i
tried
my
right
leg
felt
broken
grate
with
a
sensation
that
transcended
pain
i
heaved
with
the
other
leg
scrabbled
with
the
charred
arm
the
crawl
to
the
cabinet
dwarfed
hillary
trek
up
everest
but
i
reached
it
after
a
couple
of
years
and
found
the
microswitch
on
the
floor
that
activated
the
thing
and
then
i
was
fading
out
again
i
came
out
of
it
but
weak
my
right
leg
was
numb
but
reasonably
comfortable
clamped
tight
in
a
walking
brace
i
put
up
a
hand
and
felt
a
shaved
skull
with
sutures
it
must
have
been
a
fracture
the
left
arm
well
it
was
still
there
wrapped
to
the
shoulder
and
held
out
stiffly
by
a
power
truss
that
would
keep
the
scar
tissue
from
pulling
up
and
crippling
me
the
steady
pressure
as
the
truss
contracted
was
anything
to
do
a
on
for
replaying
at
leisure
moments
but
at
least
the
cabinet
had
amputated
i
complaining
as
far
as
i
knew
i
was
the
first
recorded
survivor
of
contact
with
the
gool
if
i
survived
i
was
still
a
long
way
from
home
and
i
had
yet
checked
on
the
condition
of
the
lifeboat
i
glanced
toward
the
entry
port
it
was
dogged
shut
i
could
see
black
marks
where
my
burned
hand
had
been
at
work
i
fumbled
my
way
into
a
couch
and
tried
to
think
in
my
condition
with
a
broken
leg
and
burns
plus
a
fractured
skull
i
should
have
been
able
to
fall
out
of
bed
much
less
make
the
trip
from
ccc
to
the
boat
and
how
had
i
managed
to
dog
that
port
shut
in
an
emergency
a
man
was
capable
of
great
exertions
but
running
on
a
broken
femur
handling
heavy
levers
with
charred
fingers
and
thinking
with
a
cracked
head
were
overdoing
it
still
i
was
here
and
it
was
time
to
get
a
call
through
to
tsa
headquarters
i
flipped
the
switch
and
gave
the
emergency
ausar
kayle
of
aerospace
intelligence
had
assigned
to
me
a
few
weeks
before
it
was
almost
five
minutes
before
the
acknowledge
came
through
from
the
ganymede
relay
station
another
ten
minutes
before
kayle
face
swam
into
view
even
through
the
blur
of
the
screen
i
could
see
the
haggard
look
granthan
he
burst
out
where
are
the
others
what
happened
out
there
i
turned
him
down
to
a
mutter
hold
on
i
said
i
tell
you
recorders
going
i
did
wait
for
an
answer
not
with
a
transmission
lag
i
plowed
on
was
sabotaged
so
was
i
think
i
got
out
i
lost
a
little
skin
but
the
aid
cabinet
has
the
case
in
hand
tell
the
med
people
the
drinks
are
on
me
i
finished
talking
and
flopped
back
waiting
for
kayle
reply
on
the
screen
his
flickering
image
gazed
back
impatiently
looking
as
hostile
as
a
ward
nurse
it
would
be
half
an
hour
before
i
would
get
his
reaction
to
my
report
i
dozed
off
and
awoke
with
a
start
kayle
was
your
report
i
wo
mince
words
they
wondering
at
your
role
in
the
disaster
how
does
it
happen
that
you
alone
survived
how
the
hell
do
i
know
i
yelled
or
croaked
but
kayle
voice
was
droning
on
you
psychodynamics
people
have
been
telling
me
the
gool
may
have
some
kind
of
telehypnotic
ability
that
might
make
it
possible
for
them
to
subvert
a
loyal
man
without
his
knowledge
told
me
yourself
that
you
blacked
out
during
the
attack
and
came
to
on
the
lifeboat
with
no
recollection
of
how
you
got
there
this
is
war
granthan
war
against
a
vicious
enemy
who
strike
without
warning
and
without
mercy
you
were
sent
out
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
what
that
term
you
use
invasion
you
know
better
than
most
the
risk
i
be
running
if
you
were
allowed
to
pass
the
patrol
line
i
sorry
granthan
i
ca
let
you
land
on
earth
i
ca
accept
the
risk
what
do
i
do
now
i
stormed
go
into
orbit
and
eat
pills
and
hope
you
think
of
something
i
need
a
doctor
presently
kayle
replied
yes
he
said
you
have
to
enter
a
parking
orbit
perhaps
there
will
be
developments
soon
which
will
make
it
possible
to
ah
restudy
the
situation
he
did
meet
my
eye
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
he
spare
me
the
mental
anguish
of
knowing
what
was
coming
i
could
really
blame
him
he
was
doing
what
he
thought
was
the
right
thing
and
i
have
to
go
along
and
pretend
right
up
until
the
warheads
struck
that
i
did
know
been
condemned
to
death
ii
i
tried
to
gather
my
wits
and
think
my
way
through
the
situation
i
was
alone
and
injured
aboard
a
lifeboat
that
would
be
the
focus
of
a
converging
flight
of
missiles
as
soon
as
i
approached
within
battery
range
of
earth
i
had
gotten
clear
of
the
gool
but
i
would
survive
my
next
meeting
with
my
own
kind
they
could
take
the
chance
that
i
was
acting
under
gool
orders
i
was
of
course
i
was
still
the
same
peter
granthan
psychodynamicist
who
had
started
out
with
dayan
fleet
six
weeks
earlier
the
thoughts
i
was
having
were
brilliant
but
they
were
mine
all
mine
but
how
could
i
be
sure
of
that
maybe
there
was
something
in
kayle
suspicion
if
the
gool
were
as
skillful
as
we
thought
they
would
have
left
no
overt
indications
of
their
tampering
not
at
a
conscious
level
but
this
was
where
psychodynamics
training
came
in
i
had
been
reacting
like
any
scared
casualty
aching
to
get
home
and
lick
his
wounds
but
i
was
just
any
casualty
i
had
been
trained
in
the
subtleties
of
the
mind
and
i
had
been
prepared
for
just
such
an
attack
now
was
the
time
to
make
use
of
that
training
it
had
given
me
one
resource
i
could
unlock
the
memories
of
my
subconscious
and
see
again
what
had
happened
i
lay
back
cleared
my
mind
of
extraneous
thoughts
and
concentrated
on
the
trigger
word
that
would
key
an
sequence
sense
impressions
faded
i
was
alone
in
the
nebulous
emptiness
of
a
trance
i
keyed
a
second
word
slipped
below
the
misty
surface
into
a
dreamworld
of
vague
phantasmagoric
figures
milling
in
their
limbo
of
i
penetrated
deeper
broke
through
into
the
vividly
hallucinatory
third
level
where
images
of
immediacy
clamored
for
attention
and
deeper
the
immense
orderly
confusion
of
the
basic
memory
level
lay
before
me
abstracted
from
it
aloof
and
observant
the
monitoring
scanned
the
pattern
searching
the
polydimensional
continuum
for
evidence
of
an
alien
intrusion
and
found
it
as
the
eye
instantaneously
detects
a
flicker
of
motion
amid
an
infinity
of
static
detail
so
my
inner
eye
perceived
the
subtle
traces
of
the
probing
gool
mind
like
a
whispered
touch
deftly
rearranging
my
buried
motivations
i
focused
selectively
tuned
to
the
recorded
gestalt
is
a
contact
effulgent
one
now
nurture
the
spark
well
it
but
trembles
at
the
threshold
is
elusive
master
it
wriggles
like
a
in
the
eating
trough
a
part
of
my
mind
watched
as
the
memory
unreeled
i
listened
to
the
voices
yet
not
voices
merely
the
shape
of
concepts
indescribably
intricate
i
saw
how
the
decoy
which
i
had
concretized
for
the
purpose
in
a
hundred
training
sessions
had
fought
against
the
intruding
stimuli
then
yielded
under
the
relentless
thrust
of
the
alien
probe
i
watched
as
the
gool
operator
took
over
the
motor
centers
caused
me
to
crawl
through
the
choking
smoke
of
the
devastated
control
compartment
toward
the
escape
hatch
fire
leaped
up
blocking
the
way
i
went
on
felt
ghostly
flames
whipping
at
me
and
then
the
hatch
was
open
and
i
pulled
myself
through
forcing
the
broken
leg
my
blackened
hand
fumbled
at
the
locking
wheel
then
the
blast
as
the
lifeboat
leaped
clear
of
the
disintegrating
dreadnought
and
the
impact
as
i
fell
at
a
level
far
below
the
conscious
the
embattled
lashed
out
again
fighting
the
invader
it
eluded
me
then
effulgent
lord
link
with
this
lowly
one
do
you
forget
all
my
teachings
cling
though
you
expend
the
last
filament
of
your
free
from
all
distraction
at
a
level
where
comprehension
and
retention
are
instantaneous
and
total
my
monitoring
basic
personality
fraction
followed
the
skillful
gool
mind
as
it
engraved
its
commands
deep
in
my
subconscious
then
the
touch
withdrew
erasing
the
scars
of
its
passage
to
leave
me
unaware
of
its
tampering
at
a
conscious
level
watching
the
gool
mind
i
learned
the
insinuating
probe
a
concept
regarding
which
psychodynamicists
had
theorized
was
no
more
than
a
pattern
in
emptiness
but
a
pattern
which
i
could
duplicate
now
that
i
had
seen
what
had
been
done
to
me
hesitantly
i
felt
for
the
immaterial
fabric
of
the
continuum
warping
and
manipulating
it
copying
the
gool
probe
like
planes
of
crystal
the
polyfinite
aspects
of
reality
shifted
into
focus
aligning
themselves
abruptly
a
channel
lay
open
as
easily
as
i
would
stretch
out
my
hand
to
pluck
a
moth
from
a
i
reached
across
the
unimaginable
void
and
sensed
a
pit
blacker
than
the
bottom
floor
of
hell
and
a
glistening
dark
shape
there
was
a
soundless
shriek
it
reached
out
touched
me
using
the
technique
i
had
grasped
from
the
gool
itself
i
struck
stifling
the
outcry
invaded
the
fetid
blackness
and
grappled
the
obscene
gelatinous
immensity
of
the
gool
spy
as
it
spasmed
in
a
frenzy
of
xenophobia
a
ton
of
liver
writhing
at
the
bottom
of
a
dark
well
i
clamped
down
control
the
gool
mind
folded
in
on
itself
gibbering
not
pausing
to
rest
i
followed
up
probed
along
my
channel
of
contact
tracing
patterns
scanning
the
flaccid
gool
mind
i
saw
a
world
of
yellow
seas
lapping
at
endless
shores
of
mud
there
was
a
fuming
pit
where
liquid
sulphur
bubbled
up
from
some
inner
source
filling
an
immense
natural
basin
the
gool
clustered
at
its
rim
feeding
each
monstrous
shape
heaving
against
its
neighbors
for
a
more
favorable
position
i
probed
farther
saw
the
great
cables
of
living
nervous
tissue
that
linked
each
eating
organ
with
the
far
underground
i
traced
the
passages
through
which
tendrils
ran
out
to
immense
caverns
where
smaller
creatures
labored
over
strange
devices
these
my
host
memory
told
me
were
the
young
of
the
gool
here
they
built
the
fleets
that
would
transport
the
spawn
to
the
new
worlds
the
prime
overlord
had
discovered
worlds
where
food
was
free
for
the
taking
not
sulphur
alone
but
potassium
calcium
iron
and
all
the
metals
riches
beyond
belief
in
endless
profusion
no
longer
would
the
gool
tribe
cluster
those
who
remained
of
a
race
at
a
single
feeding
trough
they
would
spread
out
across
a
galaxy
and
beyond
but
not
if
i
could
help
it
the
gool
had
evolved
a
plan
but
they
had
a
stroke
of
bad
luck
in
the
past
they
had
managed
to
control
a
man
here
and
there
among
the
fleets
far
from
home
but
only
at
a
superficial
level
enough
perhaps
to
wreck
a
ship
but
not
the
complete
control
needed
to
send
a
man
back
to
earth
under
gool
compulsion
to
carry
out
complex
sabotage
then
they
had
found
me
alone
a
sole
survivor
free
from
the
clutter
of
the
other
it
had
been
their
misfortune
to
pick
a
psychodynamicist
instead
of
gaining
a
patient
slave
they
had
opened
the
fortress
door
to
an
unseen
spy
now
that
i
was
there
i
would
see
what
i
could
steal
a
timeless
time
passed
i
wandered
among
patterns
of
white
light
and
white
sound
plumbed
the
deepest
recesses
of
hidden
gool
thoughts
fared
along
strange
ways
examining
the
shapes
and
colors
of
the
concepts
of
an
alien
mind
i
paused
at
last
scanning
a
structure
of
pattern
within
pattern
the
diagrammed
circuits
of
a
strange
machine
i
followed
through
its
and
like
a
its
meaning
exploded
in
my
mind
from
the
vile
nest
deep
under
the
dark
surface
of
the
gool
world
in
its
lonely
orbit
i
had
plucked
the
ultimate
secret
of
their
kind
matter
across
space
you
got
to
listen
to
me
kayle
i
shouted
i
know
you
think
a
gool
robot
but
what
i
have
is
too
big
to
let
you
blow
it
up
without
a
fight
matter
transmission
you
know
what
that
can
mean
to
us
the
concept
is
too
complex
to
try
to
describe
in
words
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
i
can
build
it
though
using
standard
components
plus
an
antenna
and
a
coil
and
a
few
other
things
i
harangued
kayle
for
a
while
and
then
sweated
out
his
answer
i
was
getting
close
now
if
he
could
see
the
beauty
of
my
proposal
my
screens
would
start
to
register
the
radiation
of
warheads
any
time
now
kayle
came
back
and
his
answer
boiled
down
to
no
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
i
reminded
him
how
i
had
readied
myself
for
the
trip
with
sessions
on
the
encephaloscope
setting
up
the
of
conditioned
defensive
responses
the
shunt
circuits
to
the
decoy
leaving
my
volitional
ego
free
i
talked
about
subliminal
hypnotics
and
the
resilience
quotient
of
the
i
might
have
saved
my
breath
i
do
understand
that
psychodynamics
jargon
granthan
he
snapped
it
smacks
of
mysticism
but
i
understand
what
the
gool
have
done
to
you
well
enough
i
sorry
i
leaned
back
and
chewed
the
inside
of
my
lip
and
thought
unkind
thoughts
about
colonel
ausar
kayle
then
i
settled
down
to
solve
the
problem
at
hand
i
keyed
the
chart
file
flashed
pages
from
the
standard
index
on
the
reference
screen
checking
radar
coverages
beacon
ranges
monitor
stations
controller
fields
it
looked
as
though
a
boat
the
size
of
mine
might
possibly
get
through
the
defensive
net
with
a
daring
pilot
and
as
a
condemned
spy
i
could
afford
to
be
daring
and
i
had
a
few
ideas
iii
the
shrilling
of
the
proximity
alarm
blasted
through
the
silence
for
a
wild
moment
i
thought
kayle
had
beaten
me
to
the
punch
then
i
realized
it
was
the
routine
dew
line
patrol
contact
z
i
am
reading
your
iff
decelerate
at
gee
preparatory
to
picking
up
approach
orbit
the
screen
went
on
droning
out
instructions
i
fed
them
into
the
autopilot
at
the
same
time
running
over
my
approach
plan
the
scout
was
moving
in
closer
i
licked
dry
lips
it
was
time
to
try
i
closed
my
eyes
reached
out
as
the
gool
mind
had
reached
out
to
me
and
felt
the
touch
of
a
signals
officer
mind
forty
thousand
miles
distant
aboard
the
patrol
vessel
there
was
a
brief
flurry
of
struggle
then
i
dictated
my
instructions
the
signals
officer
punched
keys
spoke
into
his
microphone
as
you
were
z
continue
on
present
course
at
seconds
pick
up
planetary
for
and
i
blanked
out
the
man
recollection
of
what
had
happened
caught
his
belated
puzzlement
as
i
broke
contact
but
i
was
clear
of
the
dew
line
now
rapidly
approaching
atmosphere
z
the
speaker
crackled
this
is
planetary
control
i
am
picking
you
up
on
channel
for
and
there
was
a
long
pause
then
z
countermand
dew
line
clearance
repeat
clearance
countermanded
emergency
course
change
to
standard
hyperbolic
code
do
not
attempt
repeat
do
not
attempt
it
had
taken
kayle
long
to
see
that
i
gotten
past
the
outer
line
of
defense
a
few
more
minutes
grace
would
have
helped
i
play
it
dumb
and
hope
for
a
little
luck
planetary
z
here
say
i
afraid
i
missed
part
of
that
fellows
i
a
little
banged
up
i
guess
i
switched
frequencies
on
you
what
was
that
after
up
channel
sheer
off
there
you
not
cleared
for
hey
you
birds
are
mixed
up
i
protested
i
cleared
all
the
way
i
checked
in
with
dew
it
was
time
to
disappear
i
blanked
off
all
transmission
hit
the
controls
following
my
evasive
pattern
and
again
i
reached
out
a
radar
man
at
a
site
in
the
pacific
fifteen
thousand
miles
away
rose
from
his
chair
crossed
the
darkened
room
and
threw
a
switch
the
radar
screens
blanked
off
for
an
hour
i
rode
the
long
orbit
down
fending
off
attack
after
attack
then
i
was
clear
skimming
the
surface
of
the
ocean
a
few
miles
southeast
of
key
west
the
boat
hit
hard
i
felt
the
floor
rise
up
over
buffeting
me
against
the
restraining
harness
i
hauled
at
the
release
lever
felt
a
long
moment
of
giddy
disorientation
as
the
escape
capsule
separated
from
the
sinking
lifeboat
deep
under
the
surface
then
my
escape
capsule
was
bobbing
on
the
water
i
would
have
to
risk
calling
kayle
now
but
by
voluntarily
giving
my
position
away
i
should
convince
him
i
was
still
on
our
side
and
i
was
badly
in
need
of
a
i
flipped
the
sending
key
this
is
z
i
said
i
have
an
urgent
report
for
colonel
kayle
of
aerospace
intelligence
kayle
face
appeared
do
fight
it
granthan
he
croaked
you
penetrated
the
planetary
defenses
god
knows
how
i
later
i
snapped
how
about
calling
off
your
dogs
now
and
send
somebody
out
here
to
pick
me
up
before
i
add
to
my
other
complaints
we
have
you
pinpointed
kayle
cut
in
it
no
use
fighting
it
granthan
i
felt
cold
sweat
pop
out
on
my
forehead
you
got
to
listen
kayle
i
shouted
i
suppose
you
got
missiles
on
the
way
already
call
them
back
i
have
information
that
can
win
the
war
i
sorry
granthan
kayle
said
it
too
late
even
if
i
could
take
the
chance
you
were
right
a
different
face
appeared
on
the
screen
granthan
i
am
general
titus
on
behalf
of
your
country
and
in
the
name
of
the
president
who
has
been
apprised
of
this
tragic
situation
it
is
my
privilege
to
inform
you
that
you
will
be
awarded
the
congressional
medal
of
honor
posthumously
for
your
heroic
effort
although
you
failed
and
have
in
fact
been
forced
against
your
will
to
carry
out
the
schemes
of
the
inhuman
enemy
this
in
no
way
detracts
from
your
gallant
attempt
granthan
i
salute
you
the
general
arm
went
up
in
a
rigid
gesture
stow
that
you
pompous
idiot
i
barked
i
no
spy
kayle
was
back
blanking
out
the
startled
face
of
the
general
goodbye
granthan
try
to
understand
i
flipped
the
switch
sat
gripping
the
couch
my
stomach
rising
with
each
heave
of
the
floating
escape
capsule
i
had
perhaps
five
minutes
the
missiles
would
be
from
canaveral
i
closed
my
eyes
forced
myself
to
relax
reached
out
i
sensed
the
distant
shore
the
hot
buzz
of
human
minds
at
work
in
the
cities
i
followed
the
coastline
found
the
missile
base
flicked
through
the
cluster
of
on
course
do
right
baby
that
it
right
in
the
i
fingered
my
way
through
the
man
mind
and
found
the
control
centers
he
turned
stiffly
from
the
plotting
board
tottered
to
a
panel
to
slam
his
hand
against
the
destruct
button
men
fell
on
him
dragged
him
why
did
you
blow
it
i
dropped
the
contact
found
another
who
leaped
to
the
panel
detonated
the
remainder
of
the
flight
of
six
missiles
then
i
withdrew
i
would
have
a
few
minutes
stay
of
execution
now
i
was
ten
miles
from
shore
the
capsule
had
its
own
power
plant
i
started
it
up
switched
on
the
external
viewer
i
saw
dark
sea
the
glint
of
on
the
choppy
surface
in
the
distance
a
glow
on
the
horizon
that
would
be
key
west
i
plugged
the
course
into
the
pilot
then
leaned
back
and
felt
outward
with
my
mind
for
the
next
attacker
iv
it
was
dark
in
the
trainyard
i
moved
along
the
tracks
in
a
stumbling
walk
just
a
few
more
minutes
i
was
telling
myself
few
more
minutes
and
you
can
lie
down
rest
the
shadowed
bulk
of
a
box
car
loomed
up
its
open
door
a
blacker
square
i
leaned
against
the
sill
breathing
hard
then
reached
inside
for
a
grip
with
my
good
hand
gravel
scrunched
nearby
the
beam
of
a
flashlight
lanced
out
slipped
along
the
weathered
car
caught
me
there
was
a
startled
exclamation
i
ducked
back
closed
my
eyes
felt
out
for
his
mind
there
was
a
confused
murmur
of
thought
a
random
intrusion
of
impressions
from
the
city
all
around
it
was
hard
too
hard
i
had
to
sleep
i
heard
the
snick
of
a
revolver
being
cocked
and
dropped
flat
as
a
gout
of
flame
stabbed
toward
me
the
imperative
bam
echoing
between
the
cars
i
caught
the
clear
thought
looking
shaved
head
arm
stuck
out
him
all
right
i
reached
out
to
his
mind
and
struck
at
random
the
light
fell
went
out
and
i
heard
the
unconscious
body
slam
to
the
ground
like
a
poled
steer
it
was
easy
if
i
could
only
stay
awake
i
gritted
my
teeth
pulled
myself
into
the
car
crawled
to
a
dark
corner
behind
a
crate
and
slumped
down
i
tried
to
evoke
a
personality
fraction
to
set
as
a
guard
a
part
of
my
mind
to
stay
awake
and
warn
me
of
danger
it
was
too
much
trouble
i
relaxed
and
let
it
all
slide
down
into
darkness
the
car
swayed
i
opened
my
eyes
saw
yellow
sunlight
in
a
bar
across
the
litter
on
the
floor
the
power
truss
creaked
pulling
at
my
arm
my
broken
leg
was
throbbing
its
indignation
at
the
treatment
it
had
received
walking
brace
and
all
and
the
burned
arm
was
yelling
aloud
for
more
of
that
nice
dope
that
had
been
keeping
it
from
realizing
how
bad
it
was
all
things
considered
i
felt
like
a
badly
embalmed
mummy
except
that
i
was
hungry
i
had
been
a
fool
not
to
fill
my
pockets
when
i
left
the
escape
capsule
in
the
shallows
off
key
largo
but
things
had
been
happening
too
fast
i
had
barely
made
it
to
the
fishing
boat
whose
owner
i
had
coerced
into
rendezvousing
with
me
before
shells
started
dropping
around
us
if
the
gunners
on
the
cruiser
ten
miles
away
had
had
any
luck
they
would
have
finished
me
and
the
hapless
fisherman
right
then
we
rode
out
a
couple
of
near
misses
before
i
put
the
cruiser
gunnery
crew
off
the
air
at
a
fishing
camp
on
the
beach
i
found
a
car
with
driver
he
dropped
me
at
the
railyard
and
drove
off
under
the
impression
he
was
in
town
for
groceries
he
never
believe
he
seen
me
now
i
had
my
sleep
i
had
to
start
getting
ready
for
the
next
act
of
the
farce
i
pressed
the
release
on
the
power
truss
gingerly
unclamped
it
then
rigged
a
sling
from
a
strip
of
shirt
tail
i
tied
the
arm
to
my
side
as
inconspicuously
as
possible
i
did
disturb
the
bandages
i
needed
new
clothes
or
at
least
different
ones
and
something
to
cover
my
shaved
skull
i
could
stay
hidden
forever
the
yard
cop
had
recognized
me
at
a
glance
i
lay
back
waiting
for
the
train
to
slow
for
a
town
i
was
unduly
worried
at
the
moment
the
watchman
probably
had
convinced
anyone
he
actually
seen
me
maybe
he
had
been
too
sure
himself
the
slowed
and
the
train
shuddered
to
a
stop
i
crept
to
the
door
peered
through
the
crack
there
were
sunny
fields
a
few
low
buildings
in
the
distance
the
corner
of
a
platform
i
closed
my
eyes
and
let
my
awareness
stretch
job
what
the
use
little
witch
in
the
lunch
room
up
in
the
hills
squirrel
hunting
bottle
of
whiskey
i
settled
into
control
gently
trying
not
to
alarm
the
man
i
saw
through
his
eyes
the
dusty
box
car
the
rust
on
the
tracks
the
listless
weeds
growing
among
cinders
and
the
weathered
boards
of
the
platform
i
turned
him
and
saw
the
dingy
glass
of
the
telegraph
window
a
sagging
screen
door
with
a
chipped
enameled
cola
sign
i
walked
the
man
to
the
door
and
through
it
behind
a
counter
a
girl
with
heavy
breasts
and
wet
patches
under
her
arms
looked
up
without
interest
as
the
door
banged
my
host
went
on
to
the
counter
gestured
toward
the
sandwiches
under
a
glass
cover
i
take
all
and
candy
bars
and
cigarettes
and
give
me
a
big
glass
of
water
better
git
out
there
and
look
after
yer
train
the
girl
said
carelessly
when
you
git
so
hungry
all
of
a
sudden
put
it
in
a
bag
quick
look
who
getting
bossy
my
host
rounded
the
counter
picked
up
a
used
paper
bag
began
stuffing
food
in
it
the
girl
stared
at
him
then
pushed
him
back
you
git
back
around
that
counter
she
filled
the
bag
took
a
pencil
from
behind
her
ear
that
be
one
cash
my
host
took
two
bills
from
his
shirt
pocket
dropped
them
on
the
counter
and
waited
while
the
girl
filled
a
glass
he
picked
it
up
and
started
out
hey
where
you
goin
with
my
glass
the
trainman
crossed
the
platform
headed
for
the
boxcar
he
slid
the
loose
door
back
a
few
inches
against
the
slack
latch
pushed
the
bag
inside
placed
the
glass
of
water
beside
it
then
pulled
off
his
grimy
railroader
cap
and
pushed
it
through
the
opening
he
turned
the
girl
watched
from
the
platform
a
rattle
passed
down
the
line
and
the
train
started
up
with
a
lurch
the
man
walked
back
toward
the
girl
i
heard
him
say
friend
o
mine
in
there
just
passin
through
i
was
discovering
that
it
was
necessary
to
hold
tight
control
over
every
move
of
a
subject
once
given
the
impulse
to
act
he
would
rationalize
his
behavior
fill
in
the
details
and
never
know
that
the
original
idea
had
been
his
own
i
drank
the
water
first
ate
a
sandwich
then
lit
a
cigarette
and
lay
back
so
far
so
good
the
crates
in
the
car
were
marked
naval
aerospace
station
bayou
le
cochon
with
any
luck
i
reach
new
orleans
in
another
twelve
hours
the
first
step
of
my
plan
included
a
raid
on
the
delta
national
labs
but
that
was
tomorrow
that
could
wait
it
was
a
little
before
dawn
when
i
crawled
out
of
the
car
at
a
siding
in
the
swampy
country
a
few
miles
out
of
new
orleans
i
was
feeling
good
but
i
had
a
stake
in
staying
on
my
feet
i
still
had
a
few
miles
in
me
i
had
my
supplies
a
few
candy
bars
and
some
cigarettes
stuffed
in
the
pockets
of
the
tattered
issue
coverall
otherwise
i
was
unencumbered
unless
you
wanted
to
count
the
walking
brace
on
my
right
leg
and
the
sling
binding
my
arm
i
picked
my
way
across
mushy
ground
to
a
road
started
limping
toward
a
few
car
lights
visible
half
a
mile
away
it
was
already
hot
the
swamp
air
was
like
subway
fumes
through
the
drugs
i
could
feel
my
pulse
throbbing
in
my
various
wounds
i
reached
out
and
touched
the
driver
mind
he
was
thinking
about
shrimps
a
wound
on
his
left
thumb
and
a
girl
with
black
hair
want
a
lift
he
called
i
thanked
him
and
got
in
he
gave
me
a
glance
and
i
pinched
off
his
budding
twinge
of
curiosity
it
was
almost
an
effort
now
not
to
follow
his
thoughts
it
was
as
though
my
mind
having
learned
the
trick
of
communications
with
others
instinctively
reached
out
toward
them
an
hour
later
he
dropped
me
on
a
street
corner
in
a
shabby
marketing
district
of
the
city
and
drove
off
i
hoped
he
made
out
all
right
with
the
girl
i
spotted
a
store
and
headed
for
it
twenty
minutes
later
i
was
back
on
the
sidewalk
dressed
in
a
suit
that
had
been
cut
a
long
time
ago
by
a
latin
tailor
maybe
to
settle
a
grudge
the
shirt
that
went
with
it
was
an
unsuccessful
violet
the
black
string
tie
lent
a
dubious
air
of
distinction
i
swapped
the
railroader
cap
for
a
tarnished
beret
the
man
who
had
supplied
the
outfit
was
still
asleep
i
figured
i
done
him
a
favor
by
taking
it
i
could
hope
to
pass
for
a
fisherman
i
was
the
type
maybe
i
get
by
as
a
derelict
i
walked
past
fish
stalls
racks
of
faded
garments
grimy
vegetables
in
bins
enough
wrought
iron
to
cage
a
herd
of
brontosauri
and
fetched
up
at
a
cab
stand
i
picked
a
fat
driver
with
a
wart
how
much
to
the
delta
national
laboratories
he
rolled
an
eye
toward
me
shifted
his
toothpick
what
ya
wan
na
go
out
there
for
nothing
out
there
i
a
tourist
i
said
they
told
me
before
i
left
home
not
to
miss
it
he
grunted
reached
back
and
opened
the
door
i
got
in
he
flipped
his
flag
down
started
up
with
a
clash
of
gears
and
pulled
out
without
looking
how
far
is
it
i
asked
him
it
ai
far
mile
mile
and
a
quarter
pretty
big
place
i
guess
he
did
answer
we
went
through
a
warehousing
district
swung
left
along
the
waterfront
bumped
over
railroad
tracks
and
pulled
up
at
a
cyclone
fence
with
a
locked
gate
a
buck
ten
my
driver
said
i
looked
out
at
the
fence
a
barren
field
a
distant
group
of
low
buildings
what
this
this
is
the
place
you
ast
for
that
be
a
buck
ten
mister
i
touched
his
mind
planted
a
couple
of
false
impressions
and
withdrew
he
blinked
then
started
up
drove
around
the
field
pulled
up
at
an
open
gate
with
a
guard
he
looked
back
at
me
you
want
i
should
drive
in
sir
i
get
out
here
he
jumped
out
opened
my
door
helped
me
out
with
a
hand
under
my
good
elbow
i
get
your
change
sir
he
said
reaching
for
his
hip
keep
it
thank
you
he
hesitated
maybe
i
oughta
stick
around
you
know
i
be
all
right
i
hope
so
he
said
a
man
like
you
you
and
me
he
winked
after
all
we
ai
both
wearing
berets
fer
nothing
true
i
said
consider
your
tip
doubled
now
drive
away
into
the
sunrise
and
forget
you
ever
saw
me
he
got
into
the
car
beaming
and
left
i
turned
and
sized
up
the
delta
labs
there
was
nothing
fancy
about
the
place
it
consisted
of
low
brick
and
steel
buildings
mud
a
fence
and
a
guard
who
was
looking
at
me
i
sauntered
over
i
from
iowa
city
i
said
now
the
rest
of
the
group
did
come
said
they
rather
rest
one
day
but
i
like
to
see
it
all
after
all
i
paid
just
a
minute
the
guard
said
holding
up
a
palm
you
must
be
lost
fella
this
here
ai
no
tourist
attraction
you
ca
come
in
here
this
is
the
cameo
works
i
said
anxiously
he
shook
his
head
too
bad
you
let
your
cab
go
it
an
hour
yet
till
the
bus
comes
a
staff
car
came
into
view
slowed
and
swung
wide
to
turn
in
i
fingered
the
driver
mind
the
car
swerved
braked
to
a
halt
a
portly
man
in
the
back
seat
leaned
forward
frowning
i
touched
him
he
relaxed
the
driver
leaned
across
and
opened
the
door
i
went
around
and
got
in
the
guard
was
watching
i
gave
him
a
salute
and
the
car
pulled
through
the
gate
stop
in
front
of
the
electronics
section
i
said
the
car
pulled
up
i
got
out
went
up
the
steps
and
pushed
through
the
double
glass
doors
the
car
sat
for
a
moment
then
moved
slowly
off
the
passenger
would
be
wondering
why
the
driver
had
stopped
but
the
driver
would
remember
i
was
inside
the
building
now
that
was
a
start
i
did
like
robbery
in
broad
daylight
but
it
was
a
lot
easier
this
way
i
was
equal
to
climbing
any
walls
or
breaking
down
any
locked
doors
not
until
i
had
a
transfusion
a
skin
graft
and
about
three
months
vacation
on
a
warm
beach
somewhere
a
man
in
a
white
smock
emerged
from
a
door
he
started
past
me
spun
i
here
about
the
garbage
i
said
damn
fools
put
the
cans
in
with
the
edible
are
you
the
one
called
how
that
i
ai
got
all
the
morning
i
shrilled
you
scientist
fellers
are
all
alike
which
way
is
the
watchamacallit
equipment
lab
right
along
there
he
pointed
i
did
bother
to
thank
him
it
would
have
been
in
character
a
thin
man
with
a
brush
mustache
eyed
me
sharply
as
i
pushed
through
the
door
i
looked
at
him
nodding
absently
carry
on
with
your
work
i
said
the
audit
will
be
carried
out
in
such
a
way
as
to
disturb
you
as
little
as
possible
just
show
me
your
voucher
file
if
you
please
he
sighed
and
waved
toward
a
filing
cabinet
i
went
to
it
and
pulled
a
drawer
open
glancing
about
the
room
full
shelves
were
visible
through
an
inner
door
twenty
minutes
later
i
left
the
building
carrying
a
sheet
metal
carton
containing
the
electronic
components
i
needed
to
build
a
matter
transmitter
except
for
the
parts
i
have
to
fabricate
myself
from
raw
materials
the
load
was
heavy
too
heavy
for
me
to
carry
very
far
i
parked
it
at
the
door
and
waited
until
a
truck
came
along
it
pulled
over
the
driver
climbed
out
and
came
up
the
walk
to
me
are
you
uh
he
scratched
his
head
right
i
waved
at
my
loot
put
it
in
the
back
he
obliged
together
we
rolled
toward
the
gate
the
guard
held
up
his
hand
came
forward
to
check
the
truck
he
looked
surprised
when
he
saw
me
just
who
are
you
fella
he
said
i
did
like
tampering
with
people
any
more
than
i
had
to
it
was
a
lot
like
stealing
from
a
blind
man
easy
but
nothing
to
feel
proud
of
i
gave
him
a
light
touch
just
the
suggestion
that
what
i
would
say
would
be
full
of
deep
meaning
you
know
the
regular
wednesday
shipment
i
said
darkly
keep
it
quiet
we
all
relying
on
you
sure
thing
he
said
stepping
back
we
gunned
through
the
gate
i
glanced
back
to
see
him
looking
after
the
truck
thinking
about
the
wednesday
shipment
on
a
friday
he
decided
it
was
logical
nodded
his
head
and
forgot
the
whole
thing
v
i
been
riding
high
for
a
couple
of
hours
enjoying
the
success
of
the
tricks
i
stolen
from
the
gool
now
i
suddenly
felt
like
something
the
student
morticians
had
been
practicing
on
i
guided
my
driver
through
a
residential
section
looking
for
an
shingle
on
a
front
lawn
the
one
i
found
did
inspire
much
confidence
you
could
hardly
see
it
for
the
weeds
but
i
did
want
to
make
a
big
splash
i
had
to
have
an
assist
from
my
driver
to
make
it
to
the
front
door
he
got
me
inside
parked
my
box
beside
me
and
went
off
to
finish
his
rounds
under
the
impression
that
it
had
been
a
dull
morning
the
doctor
was
a
seedy
seventyish
with
a
gross
tremor
of
the
hands
that
a
good
belt
of
scotch
would
have
helped
he
looked
at
me
as
though
i
interrupted
something
that
was
either
more
fun
or
paid
better
than
anything
i
was
likely
to
come
up
with
i
need
my
dressing
changed
doc
i
said
and
maybe
a
shot
to
keep
me
going
i
not
a
dope
peddler
he
snapped
you
got
the
wrong
place
just
a
little
medication
whatever
usual
it
a
burn
who
told
you
to
come
here
i
looked
at
him
meaningfully
the
word
gets
around
he
glared
at
me
gnashed
his
plates
then
gestured
toward
a
door
go
right
in
there
he
gaped
at
my
arm
when
the
bandages
were
off
i
took
a
quick
glance
and
wished
i
had
how
did
you
do
this
smoking
in
bed
i
said
have
you
got
something
that
he
caught
me
before
i
hit
the
floor
got
me
into
a
chair
then
he
had
that
scotch
he
been
wanting
gave
me
a
shot
as
an
and
looked
at
me
narrowly
i
suppose
you
fell
out
of
that
same
bed
and
broke
your
leg
he
said
right
hell
of
a
dangerous
bed
i
be
right
back
he
turned
to
the
door
do
go
away
just
get
some
gauze
better
stay
here
doc
there
plenty
of
gauze
right
on
that
table
see
here
skip
it
doc
i
know
all
about
you
what
i
said
about
you
he
set
to
work
then
a
guilty
conscience
is
a
tough
argument
to
answer
he
plastered
my
arm
with
something
and
rewrapped
it
then
looked
the
leg
over
and
made
a
couple
of
adjustments
to
the
brace
he
clucked
over
the
stitches
in
my
scalp
dabbed
something
on
them
that
hurt
like
hell
then
shoved
an
stickpin
needle
into
my
good
arm
that
all
i
can
do
for
you
he
said
he
handed
me
a
bottle
of
pills
here
are
some
tablets
to
take
in
an
emergency
now
get
out
call
me
a
cab
doc
i
listened
while
he
called
then
lit
a
cigarette
and
watched
through
the
curtains
the
doc
stood
by
worrying
his
upper
plate
and
eyeing
me
so
far
i
had
had
to
tinker
with
his
mind
but
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
check
i
felt
my
way
delicately
god
why
did
i
long
time
ago
mary
ever
knew
go
to
arizona
start
again
too
old
i
saw
the
nest
of
fears
that
gnawed
at
him
the
frustration
and
the
faint
flicker
of
hope
but
not
quite
dead
i
touched
his
mind
wiped
away
scars
here
your
car
he
said
he
opened
the
door
looking
at
me
i
started
past
him
are
you
sure
you
all
right
he
said
sure
pop
and
do
worry
everything
going
to
be
okay
the
driver
put
my
boxes
on
the
back
seat
i
got
in
beside
him
and
told
him
to
take
me
to
a
men
clothing
store
he
waited
while
i
changed
my
for
an
suit
new
shirt
and
underwear
and
a
replacement
beret
it
was
the
only
kind
of
hat
that
did
hurt
my
issue
shoes
were
still
good
but
i
traded
them
in
on
a
new
pair
added
a
light
raincoat
and
threw
in
a
sturdy
suitcase
for
good
measure
the
clerk
said
something
about
money
and
i
dropped
an
idea
into
his
mind
paused
long
enough
to
add
a
memory
of
a
fabulous
night
with
a
redhead
he
hardly
noticed
me
leaving
i
tried
not
to
feel
like
a
after
all
it
not
every
day
a
man
gets
a
chance
to
swap
drygoods
for
dreams
in
the
cab
i
transferred
my
belongings
to
the
new
suitcase
then
told
the
driver
to
pull
up
at
an
hotel
a
admiral
with
frayed
cuffs
helped
me
inside
with
my
luggage
the
hackie
headed
for
the
bay
to
get
rid
of
the
box
under
the
impression
i
was
a
heavy
tipper
i
had
a
meal
in
my
room
a
hot
bath
and
treated
myself
to
a
three
hour
nap
i
woke
up
feeling
as
though
those
student
embalmers
might
graduate
after
all
i
thumbed
through
the
phone
book
and
dialed
a
number
i
want
a
cadillac
or
lincoln
i
said
a
new
one
not
the
one
you
rent
for
funerals
and
a
driver
who
wo
mind
missing
a
couple
sleep
and
put
a
bed
pillow
and
a
blanket
in
the
car
i
went
down
to
the
coffee
room
then
for
a
light
meal
i
had
just
finished
a
cigarette
when
the
car
arrived
a
dark
blue
heavyweight
with
a
high
polish
and
a
low
silhouette
we
going
to
denver
i
told
the
driver
we
make
one
stop
tomorrow
i
have
a
little
shopping
to
do
i
figure
about
twenty
hours
take
a
break
every
hundred
miles
and
hold
it
under
seventy
he
nodded
i
got
in
the
back
and
sank
down
in
the
smell
of
expensive
upholstery
i
cross
town
and
pick
up
at
i
leave
the
details
to
you
i
said
he
pulled
out
into
the
traffic
and
i
got
the
pillow
settled
under
me
and
closed
my
eyes
i
need
all
the
rest
i
could
get
on
this
trip
i
heard
that
compared
with
the
denver
records
center
fort
knox
was
a
cinch
i
find
out
for
sure
when
i
got
there
the
plan
i
had
in
mind
was
the
best
i
could
have
concocted
under
more
leisurely
circumstances
but
with
every
cop
in
the
country
under
orders
to
shoot
me
on
sight
i
had
to
move
fast
my
scheme
had
the
virtue
of
unlikeliness
once
i
was
safe
in
the
central
vault
supposed
to
be
the
only
structure
ever
built
i
put
through
a
phone
call
to
the
outside
telling
them
to
watch
a
certain
spot
say
the
big
desk
in
the
president
office
then
i
assemble
my
matter
transmitter
and
drop
some
little
item
right
in
front
of
the
assembled
big
shots
they
have
to
admit
i
had
something
and
this
time
have
to
start
considering
the
possibility
that
i
was
working
for
the
enemy
it
had
been
a
smooth
trip
and
i
caught
up
on
my
sleep
now
it
was
five
and
we
were
into
the
foothills
half
an
hour
out
of
denver
i
ran
over
my
lines
planning
the
trickiest
part
of
the
job
ahead
the
initial
approach
i
listened
to
a
couple
of
news
broadcasts
the
fbi
was
still
promising
an
arrest
within
hours
i
learned
that
i
was
lying
up
or
maybe
dead
in
the
vicinity
of
key
west
and
that
the
situation
was
under
control
that
was
fine
with
me
nobody
would
expect
me
to
pop
up
in
denver
still
operating
under
my
own
power
and
wearing
a
new
suit
at
that
the
records
center
was
north
of
the
city
dug
into
mountainside
i
steered
my
chauffeur
around
the
downtown
section
out
a
street
lined
with
dark
hamburger
joints
and
unlit
gas
stations
to
where
a
side
road
branched
off
we
pulled
up
from
here
on
things
might
get
dangerous
if
i
was
wrong
about
how
easy
it
was
all
going
to
be
i
brushed
across
the
driver
mind
he
set
the
brake
and
got
out
do
know
how
i
came
to
run
out
of
gas
brown
he
said
apologetically
we
just
passed
a
station
but
it
was
closed
i
guess
i
just
have
to
hike
back
into
town
i
sure
am
sorry
i
never
did
that
before
i
told
him
it
was
okay
watched
as
he
strode
off
into
the
gloom
then
got
into
the
front
seat
and
started
up
the
gate
of
the
reservation
surrounding
the
record
center
was
only
a
mile
away
now
i
drove
slowly
feeling
ahead
for
opposition
there
did
seem
to
be
any
things
were
quiet
as
a
poker
player
with
a
pat
hand
my
timing
was
good
i
stopped
in
front
of
the
gate
under
a
floodlight
and
the
watchful
eye
of
an
with
a
shiny
black
tommygun
held
at
the
ready
he
seem
surprised
to
see
me
i
rolled
down
the
window
as
he
came
over
to
the
car
i
have
an
appointment
inside
corporal
i
said
i
touched
his
mind
the
password
is
he
nodded
stepped
back
and
motioned
me
in
i
hesitated
this
was
almost
too
easy
i
reached
out
again
middle
of
the
night
password
nice
car
i
wish
i
pulled
through
the
gate
and
headed
for
the
big
parking
lot
picking
a
spot
in
front
of
a
ramp
that
led
down
to
a
tall
steel
door
there
was
no
one
in
sight
i
got
out
dragging
my
suitcase
it
was
heavier
now
with
the
wire
and
magnets
i
added
i
crossed
the
drive
went
up
to
the
doors
the
silence
was
eerie
i
swept
the
area
searching
for
minds
found
nothing
the
shielding
i
decided
blanked
out
everything
there
was
a
personnel
door
set
in
the
big
panel
with
a
massive
combination
lock
i
leaned
my
head
against
the
door
and
felt
for
the
mechanism
turning
the
dial
right
left
right
the
lock
opened
i
stepped
inside
alert
silence
darkness
i
reached
out
sensed
walls
slabs
of
steel
concrete
intricate
mechanisms
tunnels
deep
in
the
ground
but
no
personnel
that
was
surprising
but
i
would
waste
time
questioning
my
good
luck
i
followed
a
corridor
opened
another
door
massive
as
a
vault
passed
more
halls
more
doors
my
footsteps
made
muffled
echoes
i
passed
a
final
door
and
came
into
the
heart
of
the
records
center
there
were
lights
in
the
chamber
around
the
grim
featureless
periphery
of
the
central
vault
i
set
the
valise
on
the
floor
sat
on
it
and
lit
a
cigarette
so
far
so
good
the
records
center
i
saw
had
been
even
without
my
special
knowledge
a
clever
locksmith
could
have
come
this
far
or
almost
but
the
big
vault
was
another
matter
the
great
integrating
lock
that
secured
it
would
yield
only
to
a
complex
command
from
the
computer
set
in
the
wall
opposite
the
vault
door
i
smoked
my
cigarette
and
with
eyes
closed
studied
the
vault
i
finished
the
cigarette
stepped
on
it
went
to
the
console
began
pressing
keys
tapping
out
the
necessary
formulations
half
an
hour
later
i
finished
there
was
a
whine
from
a
servo
motor
a
crimson
light
flashed
i
turned
and
saw
the
valve
cycle
open
showing
a
tunnel
within
i
dragged
my
bag
inside
threw
the
lever
that
closed
the
entry
behind
me
a
green
light
went
on
i
walked
along
the
narrow
passage
lined
with
gray
metal
shelves
stacked
with
gray
steel
tape
drums
descended
steps
came
into
a
larger
chamber
fitted
out
with
bunks
a
tiny
galley
toilet
facilities
shelves
stocked
with
food
there
was
a
radio
a
telephone
and
a
second
telephone
bright
red
that
would
be
the
to
washington
this
was
the
sanctum
sanctorum
where
the
last
survivors
could
wait
out
the
final
holocaust
indefinitely
i
opened
the
door
of
a
steel
cabinet
radiation
suits
tools
instruments
another
held
bedding
i
found
a
tapes
even
a
shelf
of
books
i
found
a
first
aid
kit
and
gratefully
gave
myself
a
jolt
of
neurite
my
pains
receded
i
went
on
to
the
next
room
there
were
wash
tubs
a
garbage
disposal
unit
a
drier
there
was
everything
here
i
needed
to
keep
me
alive
and
even
comfortable
until
i
could
convince
someone
up
above
that
i
should
be
shot
on
sight
a
heavy
door
barred
the
way
to
the
room
beyond
i
turned
a
wheel
swung
the
door
back
saw
more
walls
lined
with
filing
cabinets
a
blank
facade
of
gray
steel
and
in
the
center
of
the
room
alone
on
a
squat
table
a
yellow
plastic
case
that
any
sunday
supplement
reader
would
have
recognized
it
was
a
master
tape
the
utter
top
secret
programming
document
that
would
direct
the
terrestrial
defense
in
case
of
a
gool
invasion
it
was
almost
shocking
to
see
it
lying
there
unprotected
except
for
the
flimsy
case
the
information
it
contained
in
dot
form
could
put
my
world
in
the
palm
of
the
enemy
hand
the
room
with
the
tool
kit
would
be
the
best
place
to
work
i
decided
i
brought
the
suitcase
containing
the
electronic
gear
back
from
the
outer
door
where
i
left
it
opened
it
and
arranged
its
contents
on
the
table
according
to
the
gool
these
simple
components
were
all
i
needed
the
trick
was
in
knowing
how
to
put
them
together
there
was
work
ahead
of
me
now
there
were
the
coils
to
wind
the
intricate
antenna
arrays
to
lay
out
but
before
i
started
i
take
time
to
call
kayle
or
whoever
i
could
get
at
the
other
end
of
the
they
be
a
little
startled
when
i
turned
up
at
the
heart
of
the
defenses
they
were
trying
to
shield
i
picked
up
the
receiver
and
a
voice
spoke
well
granthan
so
you
finally
made
it
vi
here
are
your
instructions
kayle
was
saying
open
the
vault
door
come
out
stripped
and
go
to
the
center
of
the
parking
lot
stand
there
with
your
hands
over
your
head
a
single
helicopter
manned
by
a
volunteer
will
approach
and
drop
a
gas
canister
it
wo
be
lethal
i
promise
you
that
once
you
unconscious
i
personally
see
to
it
that
you
transported
to
the
institute
in
safety
every
effort
will
then
be
made
to
overcome
the
gool
conditioning
if
we
successful
you
be
awakened
if
not
he
let
the
sentence
hang
it
did
need
to
be
finished
i
understood
what
he
meant
i
was
listening
i
was
still
not
too
worried
here
i
was
safe
against
anything
until
the
food
ran
out
and
that
would
be
for
months
you
bluffing
kayle
i
said
you
trying
to
put
the
best
face
on
something
that
you
ca
control
if
you
you
were
careless
at
delta
labs
granthan
there
were
too
many
people
with
odd
blanks
in
their
memories
and
too
many
unusual
occurrences
all
on
the
same
day
you
tipped
your
hand
once
we
knew
what
we
were
up
against
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
following
you
at
an
adequate
distance
we
have
certain
shielding
materials
as
you
know
we
tried
them
all
there
a
new
one
that
quite
effective
but
as
i
was
saying
we
kept
you
under
constant
surveillance
when
we
saw
which
way
you
were
heading
we
just
stayed
out
of
sight
and
let
you
trap
yourself
you
lying
why
would
you
want
me
here
that
very
simple
kayle
said
harshly
it
the
finest
trap
ever
built
by
man
and
you
safely
in
it
safely
is
right
i
have
everything
i
need
here
and
that
brings
me
to
my
reason
for
being
here
in
case
you
curious
i
going
to
build
a
matter
transmitter
and
to
prove
my
good
faith
i
transmit
the
master
tape
to
you
i
show
you
that
i
could
have
stolen
the
damned
thing
if
i
wanted
to
indeed
tell
me
granthan
do
you
really
think
we
be
fools
enough
to
leave
the
master
tape
behind
when
we
evacuated
the
area
i
do
know
about
that
but
it
here
sorry
kayle
said
you
deluding
yourself
his
voice
was
suddenly
softer
some
of
the
triumph
gone
from
it
do
bother
struggling
granthan
the
finest
brains
in
the
country
have
combined
to
place
you
where
you
are
you
have
a
chance
except
to
do
as
i
say
make
it
easy
on
yourself
i
have
no
wish
to
extend
your
ordeal
you
ca
touch
me
kayle
this
vault
is
proof
against
a
and
it
stocked
for
a
siege
that
right
kayle
said
his
voice
sounded
tired
it
proof
against
a
but
what
if
the
in
the
vault
with
you
i
felt
like
a
demolition
man
working
to
defuse
a
suddenly
heard
a
loud
click
from
the
detonator
i
dropped
the
phone
stared
around
the
room
i
saw
nothing
that
could
be
a
bomb
i
ran
to
the
next
room
the
one
beyond
nothing
i
went
back
to
the
phone
grabbed
it
up
you
ought
to
know
better
than
to
bluff
now
kayle
i
yelled
i
would
leave
this
spot
now
for
half
a
dozen
hypothetical
in
the
center
room
kayle
said
lift
the
cover
over
the
floor
drain
you
find
it
there
you
know
what
they
look
like
do
tamper
with
its
mechanism
it
internally
trapped
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
we
did
bother
installing
a
dummy
i
dropped
the
phone
hurried
to
the
spot
kayle
had
described
the
bomb
casing
was
there
a
dull
gray
ovoid
with
a
lifting
eye
set
in
the
top
it
did
look
dangerous
it
just
lay
quietly
waiting
back
at
the
telephone
i
had
trouble
finding
my
voice
how
long
i
croaked
it
was
triggered
when
you
entered
the
vault
kayle
said
there
a
time
mechanism
it
irreversible
you
ca
force
anyone
to
cancel
it
and
it
no
use
your
hiding
in
the
outer
passages
the
whole
center
will
be
destroyed
in
the
blast
even
it
ca
stand
against
a
bomb
buried
in
its
heart
but
we
gladly
sacrifice
the
center
to
eliminate
you
how
long
i
suggest
you
come
out
quickly
so
that
a
crew
can
enter
the
vault
to
disarm
the
bomb
long
when
you
ready
to
emerge
call
me
the
line
went
dead
i
put
the
phone
back
in
its
cradle
carefully
like
a
rare
and
valuable
egg
i
tried
to
think
i
been
charging
full
speed
ahead
ever
since
i
had
decided
on
my
scheme
of
action
while
i
was
still
riding
the
surf
off
the
florida
coast
and
i
stuck
to
it
now
it
had
hatched
in
my
face
and
the
thing
that
had
crawled
out
was
the
downy
little
chick
of
success
it
had
teeth
and
claws
and
was
eyeing
me
like
a
basilisk
but
i
still
had
unplayed
aces
if
there
was
time
i
had
meant
to
use
the
matter
transmitter
to
stage
a
dramatic
proof
that
i
was
the
tool
of
the
enemy
the
demonstration
would
be
more
dramatic
than
i
planned
the
bomb
would
fit
the
machine
as
easily
as
the
tape
the
wheels
would
be
surprised
when
their
firecracker
went
off
right
on
schedule
in
the
middle
of
the
mojave
desert
i
set
to
work
my
heart
pounding
if
i
could
bring
this
off
if
i
had
time
if
the
transmitter
worked
as
advertised
the
stolen
knowledge
flowed
smoothly
effortlessly
it
was
as
though
i
had
been
assembling
matter
transmitters
for
years
knew
every
step
by
heart
first
the
moebius
windings
yard
after
yard
of
heavy
copper
around
a
core
of
carbon
then
the
power
supply
the
first
and
second
stage
amplimitters
how
long
in
the
sump
in
the
next
room
the
bomb
lay
quietly
ticking
how
long
the
main
assembly
was
ready
now
i
laid
out
cables
tying
my
apparatus
in
to
the
atomic
buried
under
the
vault
the
demand
for
one
short
instant
would
tax
even
those
mighty
engines
i
fixed
hooks
at
the
proper
points
in
the
room
wove
soft
aluminum
wire
in
the
correct
pattern
i
was
almost
finished
now
how
long
i
made
the
last
connections
cleared
away
the
litter
the
matter
transmitter
stood
on
the
table
complete
at
any
instant
the
bomb
would
reduce
it
and
the
secret
of
its
construction
to
incandescent
gas
unless
i
transmitted
the
bomb
out
of
range
first
i
turned
toward
the
laundry
room
and
the
telephone
rang
i
hesitated
then
crossed
the
room
and
snatched
it
up
listen
to
me
kayle
said
grimly
give
me
straight
fast
answers
you
said
the
master
tape
was
there
in
the
vault
with
you
now
tell
me
what
does
it
look
like
what
the
ah
dummy
tape
what
is
its
appearance
it
a
roughly
square
plastic
container
bright
yellow
about
a
foot
thick
what
about
it
kayle
voice
sounded
strained
i
made
inquiries
no
one
here
seems
to
know
the
exact
present
location
of
the
master
tape
each
department
says
that
they
were
under
the
impression
that
another
handled
the
matter
i
unable
to
learn
who
precisely
removed
the
tape
from
the
vault
now
you
say
there
is
a
yellow
plastic
container
i
know
what
the
master
tape
looks
like
i
said
this
is
either
it
or
a
hell
of
a
good
copy
granthan
kayle
said
there
was
a
note
of
desperation
in
his
voice
now
there
have
been
some
blunders
made
i
knew
you
were
under
the
influence
of
the
gool
it
did
occur
to
me
that
i
might
be
too
why
did
i
make
it
possible
for
you
to
successfully
penetrate
to
the
central
vault
there
were
a
hundred
simpler
ways
in
which
i
could
have
dealt
with
the
problem
we
in
trouble
granthan
serious
trouble
the
tape
you
have
there
is
genuine
we
all
played
into
the
hands
you
wasting
valuable
time
kayle
i
snapped
when
does
the
bomb
go
up
granthan
there
little
time
left
bring
the
master
tape
and
leave
the
vault
no
dice
kayle
i
staying
until
i
finish
the
transmitter
then
granthan
if
there
anything
to
your
mad
idea
of
such
a
machine
destroy
it
quickly
do
you
see
the
gool
would
only
have
given
you
the
secret
in
order
to
enable
you
to
steal
the
tape
i
cut
him
off
in
the
sudden
silence
i
heard
a
distant
sound
or
had
i
sensed
a
thought
i
strained
outward
volunteered
damn
fool
thing
on
my
head
is
heavy
better
work
now
okay
valve
gas
kills
in
a
split
second
then
get
out
i
stabbed
out
pushed
through
the
obscuring
veil
of
masonry
sensed
a
man
in
the
computer
room
dressed
in
gray
coveralls
a
grotesque
shield
over
his
head
and
shoulders
he
reached
for
a
valve
i
struck
at
his
mind
felt
him
stagger
back
fall
i
fumbled
in
his
brain
stimulated
the
sleep
center
he
sank
deep
into
unconsciousness
i
leaned
against
the
table
weak
with
the
reaction
kayle
had
almost
tricked
me
that
time
i
reached
out
again
swept
the
area
with
desperate
urgency
far
away
i
sensed
the
hazy
clutter
of
many
minds
out
of
range
there
was
nothing
more
the
poisonous
gas
had
been
the
only
threat
except
the
bomb
itself
but
i
had
to
move
fast
before
my
time
ran
out
to
transmit
the
bomb
to
a
desert
area
i
paused
stood
frozen
in
a
desert
what
desert
the
transmitter
operated
in
accordance
with
as
rigid
a
set
of
laws
as
did
the
planets
swinging
in
their
orbits
strange
laws
but
laws
of
nature
none
the
less
no
receiver
was
required
the
destination
of
the
mass
under
transmission
was
determined
by
the
operator
holding
in
his
mind
the
conceptualization
of
the
target
guiding
the
action
of
the
machine
and
i
had
no
target
i
could
no
more
direct
the
bomb
to
a
desert
without
a
grasp
of
its
spatial
temporal
and
entropic
than
i
could
fire
a
rifle
at
a
target
in
the
dark
i
was
like
a
man
with
a
grenade
in
his
hand
pin
pulled
and
locked
in
a
cell
i
swept
the
exocosm
again
desperately
and
caught
a
thin
live
line
i
traced
it
it
cut
through
the
mountain
dived
deep
underground
crossed
the
boundless
plain
never
branching
it
bored
on
turning
upward
now
and
ending
i
rested
gathering
strength
then
probed
straining
there
was
a
room
men
i
recognized
kayle
haggard
a
tall
man
in
braided
blue
stood
near
him
others
stood
silently
by
tension
on
every
face
maps
covered
the
wall
behind
them
i
was
looking
into
the
war
room
at
the
pentagon
in
washington
the
line
i
had
traced
was
the
telephonic
the
link
between
the
record
center
and
the
command
level
it
was
a
heavy
cable
well
protected
and
always
open
it
would
free
me
from
the
trap
with
skill
i
scanned
the
room
memorized
its
then
i
withdrew
like
a
swimmer
coming
up
from
a
long
dive
i
fought
my
way
back
to
the
level
of
immediate
awareness
i
sagged
into
a
chair
blinking
at
the
drab
walls
the
complexity
of
the
transmitter
i
must
move
fast
now
place
the
bomb
in
the
transmitter
field
direct
it
at
the
target
with
an
effort
i
got
to
my
feet
went
to
the
sump
lifted
the
cover
i
grasped
the
lifting
eye
strained
and
the
bomb
came
up
out
onto
the
floor
i
dragged
it
to
the
transmitter
and
only
then
realized
what
i
been
about
to
do
my
target
the
war
room
the
of
earth
defenses
and
i
had
been
ready
to
dump
the
hell
bomb
there
in
my
frenzy
to
be
rid
of
it
i
would
have
played
into
the
hands
of
the
gool
vii
i
went
to
the
phone
kayle
i
guess
you
got
a
recorder
on
the
line
i
give
you
the
details
of
the
transmitter
circuits
it
complicated
but
fifteen
minutes
ought
to
no
time
kayle
cut
in
i
sorry
about
everything
granthan
if
you
finished
the
machine
it
a
tragedy
for
humanity
if
it
works
i
can
only
ask
you
to
try
when
the
gool
command
comes
not
to
give
them
what
they
want
i
tell
you
now
granthan
the
bomb
blows
in
there
was
a
pause
two
minutes
and
seconds
try
to
hold
them
off
if
you
can
stand
against
them
for
that
long
at
least
i
slammed
the
phone
down
cold
sweat
popping
out
across
my
face
two
minutes
too
late
for
anything
the
men
in
the
war
room
would
never
know
how
close
i
had
come
to
beating
the
gool
and
them
but
i
could
still
save
the
master
tape
i
wrestled
the
yellow
plastic
case
that
housed
the
tape
onto
the
table
into
the
machine
and
the
world
vanished
in
a
blaze
of
darkness
a
clamor
of
silence
masters
now
link
up
link
up
like
a
bad
dream
coming
back
in
daylight
i
felt
the
obscene
presence
of
massed
gool
minds
attenuated
by
distance
but
terrible
in
their
power
probing
thrusting
i
fought
back
struggling
against
paralysis
trying
to
gather
my
strength
use
what
i
had
learned
masters
how
it
would
elude
us
blank
it
off
together
now
the
paths
closed
before
me
my
mind
writhed
twisted
darted
here
and
there
and
met
only
the
impenetrable
shield
of
the
gool
defenses
tires
masters
work
swiftly
now
let
us
impress
on
the
subject
the
of
the
brain
the
conceptualization
drifted
into
my
mind
man
transmit
the
tape
here
as
from
a
distance
the
monitor
personality
fraction
watched
the
struggle
kayle
had
been
right
the
gool
had
waited
and
now
their
moment
had
come
even
my
last
impulse
of
defiance
to
place
the
tape
in
the
machine
had
been
at
the
gool
command
they
had
looked
into
my
mind
they
understand
psychology
as
no
human
analyst
ever
could
and
they
had
led
me
in
the
most
effective
way
possible
by
letting
me
believe
i
was
the
master
they
had
made
use
of
my
human
ingenuity
to
carry
out
their
wishes
and
kayle
had
made
it
easy
for
them
by
evacuating
a
radius
around
me
leaving
the
field
clear
for
the
gool
the
gool
voice
rang
like
a
bell
in
my
mind
the
tape
here
even
as
i
fought
against
the
impulse
to
comply
i
felt
my
arm
twitch
toward
the
machine
the
switch
the
voice
thundered
i
struggled
willed
my
arm
to
stay
at
my
side
only
a
minute
longer
i
thought
only
a
minute
more
and
the
bomb
would
save
me
up
masters
will
not
link
you
plot
to
feed
at
my
by
the
mother
worm
i
pledge
my
groove
at
the
eating
trough
for
us
the
man
will
gut
the
great
vault
of
his
nest
world
you
bloat
at
our
expense
would
you
bicker
now
link
up
the
gool
raged
and
i
grasped
for
an
elusive
thought
and
held
it
the
bomb
only
a
few
feet
away
the
waiting
machine
and
the
gool
had
given
me
the
of
their
cavern
with
infinite
sluggishness
i
moved
up
masters
then
all
will
feed
is
a
trick
i
will
not
i
found
the
bomb
fumbled
for
a
grip
masters
now
is
the
prize
lost
to
us
unless
you
join
with
me
my
breath
choked
off
in
my
throat
a
hideous
pain
coiled
outward
from
my
chest
but
it
was
unimportant
only
the
bomb
mattered
i
tottered
groping
there
was
the
table
the
transmitter
i
lifted
the
bomb
felt
the
skin
of
my
burned
arm
crackle
as
i
strained
i
thrust
the
case
containing
the
master
tape
out
of
the
field
of
the
transmitter
then
pushed
the
bomb
into
position
i
groped
for
the
switch
found
it
i
tried
to
draw
breath
felt
only
a
surge
of
agony
blackness
was
closing
in
the
from
the
whirling
fog
of
pain
and
darkness
i
brought
the
target
concept
of
the
gool
cavern
into
view
clarified
it
held
it
hold
the
man
disaster
then
i
felt
the
gool
their
suspicions
yielding
to
the
panic
in
the
mind
of
the
prime
overlord
link
their
power
against
me
i
stood
paralyzed
felt
my
identity
dissolving
like
water
pouring
from
a
smashed
pot
i
tried
to
remember
but
it
was
too
faint
too
far
away
then
from
somewhere
a
voice
seemed
to
cut
in
the
calm
voice
of
an
emergency
reserve
personality
fraction
you
are
under
attack
activate
the
reserve
plan
level
five
use
level
five
act
now
use
level
five
through
the
miasma
of
gool
pressure
i
felt
the
hairs
stiffen
on
the
back
of
my
neck
all
around
me
the
gool
voices
raged
a
swelling
symphony
of
discord
but
they
were
nothing
level
five
there
was
no
turning
back
the
compulsions
were
there
acting
even
as
i
drew
in
a
breath
to
howl
my
terror
level
five
down
past
the
shapes
of
dreams
the
intense
faces
of
hallucination
level
three
level
four
and
the
silent
ranked
memories
and
deeper
still
into
a
region
of
looming
gibbering
horror
of
shadowy
moving
shapes
of
evil
of
dreaded
presences
that
lurked
at
the
edge
of
vision
down
amid
the
clamor
of
voiceless
fears
the
mounting
hungers
the
reaching
claws
of
all
that
man
had
feared
since
the
first
tailless
primate
screamed
out
his
terror
in
a
the
fear
of
falling
the
fear
of
heights
down
to
level
five
nightmare
level
i
groped
outward
found
the
plane
of
contact
and
hurled
the
weight
of
man
ancient
fears
at
the
waiting
gool
and
in
their
black
confining
caves
deep
in
the
rock
of
a
far
world
they
felt
the
roaring
tide
of
fear
fear
of
the
dark
and
of
living
burial
the
horrors
in
secret
mind
confronted
the
horrors
of
the
gool
brain
pit
and
i
felt
them
break
retreat
in
blind
panic
from
me
all
but
one
the
prime
overlord
reeled
back
with
the
rest
but
his
was
a
mind
of
terrible
power
i
sensed
for
a
moment
his
bloated
immense
form
the
seething
gnawing
hungers
insatiable
never
to
be
appeased
then
he
rallied
but
he
was
alone
now
up
masters
the
prize
is
lost
kill
the
man
kill
the
man
i
felt
a
knife
at
my
heart
it
fluttered
and
stopped
and
in
that
instant
i
broke
past
his
control
threw
the
switch
there
was
the
sharp
crack
of
imploding
air
then
i
was
floating
down
ever
down
and
all
sensation
was
far
away
kill
the
pain
cut
off
in
an
instant
of
profound
silence
and
utter
dark
then
sound
roared
in
my
ears
and
i
felt
the
harsh
grate
of
the
floor
against
my
face
as
i
fell
and
then
i
knew
nothing
more
i
hope
general
titus
was
saying
that
you
accept
the
decoration
now
granthan
it
will
be
the
first
time
in
history
that
a
civilian
has
been
accorded
this
honor
and
you
deserve
it
i
was
lying
in
a
clean
white
bed
propped
up
by
big
soft
pillows
with
a
couple
of
nurses
hovering
a
few
feet
away
i
was
in
a
mood
to
tolerate
even
titus
thanks
general
i
said
i
suggest
you
give
the
medal
to
the
volunteer
who
came
in
to
gas
me
he
knew
what
he
was
going
up
against
i
did
it
over
now
granthan
kayle
said
he
attempted
to
beam
settled
for
a
frosty
smile
you
surely
understand
understanding
i
said
that
all
we
need
to
turn
this
planet
and
a
lot
of
other
ones
into
the
kind
of
worlds
the
human
mind
needs
to
expand
into
you
tired
granthan
kayle
said
you
get
some
rest
in
a
few
weeks
you
be
back
on
the
job
as
good
as
new
that
where
the
key
is
i
said
in
our
minds
there
so
much
there
and
we
have
even
scratched
the
surface
to
the
mind
nothing
is
impossible
matter
is
an
illusion
space
and
time
are
just
convenient
fictions
i
leave
the
medal
here
granthan
when
you
feel
equal
to
it
we
make
the
official
presentation
television
he
faded
off
as
i
closed
my
eyes
and
thought
about
things
that
had
been
clamoring
for
attention
ever
since
i
met
the
gool
but
had
had
time
to
explore
my
arm
i
felt
my
way
along
it
from
inside
tracing
the
area
of
damage
watching
as
the
bodily
defenses
worked
away
toiling
to
renew
replace
it
was
a
slow
mindless
process
but
if
i
helped
a
little
it
was
easy
the
pattern
was
there
i
felt
the
tissues
renew
themselves
the
skin
regenerate
the
bone
was
more
difficult
i
searched
out
the
necessary
minerals
diverted
blood
the
broken
ends
knit
the
nurse
was
bending
over
me
a
bowl
of
soup
in
her
hand
you
been
asleep
for
a
long
time
sir
she
said
smiling
how
about
some
nice
chicken
broth
now
i
ate
the
soup
and
asked
for
more
a
doctor
came
and
peeled
back
my
bandages
did
a
and
rushed
away
i
looked
the
skin
was
new
and
pink
like
a
baby
but
it
was
all
there
i
flexed
my
right
leg
there
was
no
twinge
of
pain
i
listened
for
a
while
as
the
doctors
gabbled
clucked
probed
and
made
pronouncements
then
i
closed
my
eyes
again
i
thought
about
the
matter
transmitter
the
government
was
sitting
on
it
of
course
a
military
secret
of
the
greatest
importance
titus
called
it
maybe
someday
the
public
would
hear
about
it
in
the
meantime
how
about
letting
me
out
of
here
i
said
suddenly
a
doctor
with
a
fringe
of
gray
hair
blinked
at
me
went
back
to
fingering
my
arm
kayle
hove
into
view
i
want
out
i
said
i
recovered
right
so
now
just
give
me
my
clothes
now
now
just
relax
granthan
you
know
it
not
as
simple
as
that
there
are
a
lot
of
matters
we
must
go
over
the
war
over
i
said
you
admitted
that
i
want
out
sorry
kayle
shook
his
head
that
out
of
the
question
doc
i
said
am
i
well
yes
he
said
amazing
case
you
as
fit
as
you
ever
be
never
i
afraid
you
have
to
resign
yourself
to
being
here
for
a
while
longer
granthan
kayle
said
after
all
we
ca
ca
let
the
secret
of
matter
transmission
run
around
loose
hey
so
until
you
figure
out
the
angles
i
a
prisoner
right
i
hardly
call
it
that
granthan
still
i
closed
my
eyes
the
matter
transmitter
a
strange
device
a
field
not
distorting
space
but
accentuating
certain
characteristics
of
a
matter
field
in
subtly
shifting
relationships
just
as
the
mind
could
compare
unrelated
data
draw
from
them
new
concepts
new
parallels
the
circuits
of
the
matter
transmitter
and
the
patterns
of
the
mind
the
exocosm
and
the
endocosm
like
the
skin
and
the
orange
everywhere
in
contact
somewhere
there
was
a
beach
of
white
sand
and
dunes
with
graceful
that
leaned
in
a
gentle
wind
there
was
blue
water
to
the
far
horizon
and
a
blue
sky
and
nowhere
were
there
any
generals
with
medals
and
television
cameras
or
bureaucrats
with
long
schemes
and
with
this
gentle
folding
thus
and
a
pressure
here
so
i
opened
my
eyes
raised
myself
on
one
elbow
and
saw
the
sea
the
sun
was
hot
on
my
body
but
not
too
hot
and
the
sand
was
white
as
sugar
far
away
a
seagull
tilted
circling
a
wave
rolled
in
washed
my
foot
in
cool
water
i
lay
on
my
back
and
looked
up
at
white
clouds
in
a
blue
sky
and
smiled
then
laughed
aloud
distantly
the
seagull
cry
echoed
my
laughter
