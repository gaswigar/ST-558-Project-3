who
art
ignorant
of
what
thou
art
nought
knowing
of
whence
i

prospero
master
of
a
full
poor
cell
and
thy
no
greater
father
miranda
more
to
know
did
never
meddle
with

prospero
is
time
i
should
inform

my
magic
garment
from
me
so
lays
down
his
mantle
lie
there

comfort
the
direful
spectacle

the
wreck
which
the
very
virtue
of
compassion
in
thee
i
have
with
such
provision
in
mine
art
so
safely
ordered
that
there
is
no
no
not
so
much
perdition
as
an
hair
betid
to
any
creature
in
the
vessel
which
thou
cry
which
thou
sink
sit
down
for
thou
must
now
know
farther
miranda
you
have
often
begun
to
tell
me
what
i
am
but
stopp
and
left
me
to
a
bootless
inquisition
concluding
not
yet
prospero
the
hour
now
come
the
very
minute
bids
thee
ope
thine
ear
obey
and
be
attentive
canst
thou
remember
a
time
before
we
came
unto
this
cell
i
do
not
think
thou
canst
for
then
thou
wast
not
out
three
years
old
miranda
certainly
sir
i
can
prospero
by
what
by
any
other
house
or
person
of
any
thing
the
image
tell
me
that
hath
kept
with
thy
remembrance
miranda
is
far
off
and
rather
like
a
dream
than
an
assurance
that
my
remembrance
warrants
had
i
not
four
or
five
women
once
that
tended
me
prospero
thou
hadst
and
more
miranda
but
how
is
it
that
this
lives
in
thy
mind
what
seest
thou
else
in
the
dark
backward
and
abysm
of
time
if
thou
aught
ere
thou
here
how
thou
here
thou
mayst
miranda
but
that
i
do
not
prospero
twelve
year
since
miranda
twelve
year
since
thy
father
was
the
duke
of
milan
and
a
prince
of
power
miranda
sir
are
not
you
my
father
prospero
thy
mother
was
a
piece
of
virtue
and
she
said
thou
wast
my
daughter
and
thy
father
was
duke
of
milan
and
his
only
heir
and
princess
no
worse
issued
miranda
o
the
heavens
what
foul
play
had
we
that
we
came
from
thence
or
blessed
we
did
prospero
both
both
my
girl
by
foul
play
as
thou
were
we
heav
thence
but
blessedly
holp
hither
miranda
o
my
heart
bleeds
to
think
o
th
teen

i
have
turn
you
to
which
is
from
my
remembrance
please
you
farther
prospero
my
brother
and
thy
uncle

i
pray
thee
mark
me
that
a
brother
should
be
so
perfidious
he
whom
next
thyself
of
all
the
world
i
lov
and
to
him
put
the
manage
of
my
state
as
at
that
time
through
all
the
signories
it
was
the
first
and
prospero
the
prime
duke
being
so
reputed
in
dignity
and
for
the
liberal
arts
without
a
parallel
those
being
all
my
the
government
i
cast
upon
my
brother
and
to
my
state
grew
stranger
being
transported
and
rapt
in
secret
studies
thy
false
dost
thou
attend
me
miranda
sir
most
heedfully
prospero
being
once
perfected
how
to
grant
suits
how
to
deny
them
who
t
advance
and
who
to
trash
for
new
created
the
creatures
that
were
mine
i
say
or
chang
or
else
new
form
having
both
the
key
of
officer
and
office
set
all
hearts
i
th
state
to
what
tune
pleas
his
ear
that
now
he
was
the
ivy
which
had
hid
my
princely
trunk
and
suck
my
verdure
out
o
thou
not
miranda
o
good
sir
i
do
prospero
i
pray
thee
mark
me
i
thus
neglecting
worldly
ends
all
dedicated
to
closeness
and
the
bettering
of
my
mind
with
that
which
but
by
being
so
retir
all
popular
rate
in
my
false
brother
awak
an
evil
nature
and
my
trust
like
a
good
parent
did
beget
of
him
a
falsehood
in
its
contrary
as
great
as
my
trust
was
which
had
indeed
no
limit
a
confidence
sans
bound
he
being
thus
lorded
not
only
with
what
my
revenue
yielded
but
what
my
power
might
else
exact
like
one
who
having
into
truth
by
telling
of
it
made
such
a
sinner
of
his
memory
to
credit
his
own
did
believe
he
was
indeed
the
duke
out
o
th
substitution
and
executing
th
outward
face
of
royalty
with
all
prerogative
hence
his
ambition
dost
thou

miranda
your
tale
sir
would
cure
deafness
prospero
to
have
no

now
incapable
confederates
so
dry

was
for
sway
wi
th
king
of
naples
to
give
him
annual
tribute
do
him
homage
subject
his
coronet
to
his
crown
and
bend
the
dukedom
yet
poor
milan
to
most
ignoble
stooping
miranda
o
the
heavens
prospero
mark
his
condition
and
th
event
then
tell
me
if
this
might
be
a
brother
miranda
i
should
sin
to
think
but
nobly
of
my
grandmother
good
wombs

borne
bad
sons

now
the
condition

king
of
naples
being
an
enemy
to
me
inveterate
hearkens
my
brother
suit
which
was
that
he
in
lieu
o
th
premises
of
homage
and
i
know
not
how
much
tribute
should
presently
extirpate
me
and
mine
out
of
the
dukedom
and
confer
fair
milan
with
all
the
honours
on
my
brother
whereon
a
treacherous
army
levied
one
midnight
fated
to
th
purpose
did
antonio
open
the
gates
of
milan
and
i
th
dead
of
darkness
the
ministers
for
th
purpose
hurried
thence
me
and
thy
crying
self
miranda
alack
for

a
mark
so
bloody
on
the
business

with
colours
fairer
painted
their
foul
ends
in

hurried
us
aboard

us
some
leagues
to

where
they
prepared
a
rotten
carcass
of
a
butt
not

the
very
rats
instinctively
have
quit
it
there

some
sailor

the
masters
of
some

the

have
just
our
theme
of
woe
but
for
the
miracle
i

then
wisely
good
sir
weigh
our
sorrow

antonio
the

taken

therefore

a
match
adrian
though
this

seem
to
be
antonio
ha
ha
ha
sebastian
so
you
paid
adrian
uninhabitable
and
almost
sebastian
adrian
antonio
he
could
not
adrian
it
must
needs
be
of
subtle
tender
and
delicate
temperance
antonio
temperance
was
a
delicate
wench
sebastian
ay
and
a
subtle
as
he
most
learnedly
deliver
adrian
the
air
breathes
upon
us
here
most
sweetly
sebastian
as
if
it
had
lungs
and
rotten
ones
antonio
or
as
perfum
by
a
fen
gonzalo
here
is
everything
advantageous
to
life
antonio
true
save
means
to
live
sebastian
of
that
there
none
or
little
gonzalo
how
lush
and
lusty
the
grass
looks
how
green
antonio
the
ground
indeed
is
tawny
sebastian
with
an
eye
of
green
i
antonio
he
misses
not
much
sebastian
no
he
doth
but
mistake
the
truth
totally
gonzalo
but
the
rarity
of
it
is
which
is
indeed
almost
beyond
sebastian
as
many
vouch
rarities
are
gonzalo
that
our
garments
being
as
they
were
in
the
sea
hold
notwithstanding
their
freshness
and
glosses
being
rather
than
stain
with
salt
water
antonio
if
but
one
of
his
pockets
could
speak
would
it
not
say
he
lies
sebastian
ay
or
very
falsely
pocket
up
his
report
gonzalo
methinks
our
garments
are
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
put
them
on
first
in
afric
at
the
marriage
of
the
king
fair
daughter
claribel
to
the
king
of
tunis
sebastian
was
a
sweet
marriage
and
we
prosper

and
ride
upon

water
whose
enmity
he
flung
aside
and
breasted
the
surge
most
swoln
that
met
him
his
bold
head
the
contentious
waves
he
kept
and
oared
himself
with
his
good
arms
in
lusty
stroke
to
th
shore
that
his
basis
bowed
as
stooping
to
relieve
him
i
not

thank

for
this
great
loss

fooling

antonio
what
a
blow

gonzalo
you
are
gentlemen
of
brave

lift
the
moon
out
of

five
weeks
without
changing
enter
ariel
invisible
playing

all
sleep
but
alonso
sebastian
and
antonio
alonso
what
all
so
soon
asleep
i
wish
mine
eyes
would
with
themselves
shut
up
my
thoughts
i
find
they
are
inclin
to
do
so
sebastian
please
you
sir
do
not
omit
the
heavy
offer
of
it
it
seldom
visits
sorrow
when
it
doth
it
is
a
comforter
antonio

my

will
guard
your

while
you
take
your
rest
and
watch
your
safety
alonso
thank
heavy
alonso
sleeps
exit
ariel
sebastian
what
a
strange
drowsiness
possesses
them
antonio
it
is
the
quality
o
th
climate
sebastian
why
doth
it
not
then
our
eyelids
sink
i
find
not
myself
dispos
to
sleep
antonio
nor
i
my
spirits
are
nimble
they
fell
together
all
as
by
consent
they
dropp
as
by
a
what
might
worthy
sebastian
o
what
might
no
more
and
yet
methinks
i
see
it
in
thy
face
what
thou
shouldst
be
th
occasion
speaks
thee
and
my
strong
imagination
sees
a
crown
dropping
upon
thy
head
sebastian
what
art
thou
waking
antonio
do
you
not
hear
me
speak
sebastian
i
do
and
surely
it
is
a
sleepy
language
and
thou
out
of
thy
sleep
what
is
it
thou
didst
say
this
is
a
strange
repose
to
be
asleep
with
eyes
wide
open
standing
speaking
moving
and
yet
so
fast
asleep
antonio
noble
sebastian
thou
thy
fortune
rather
whiles
thou
art
waking
sebastian
thou
dost
snore
distinctly
there
meaning
in
thy
snores
antonio
i
am
more
serious
than
my
custom
you
must
be
so
too
if
heed
me
which
to
do
trebles
thee
sebastian
well
i
am
standing
water
antonio
i
teach
you
how
to
flow
sebastian
do
so
to
ebb
hereditary
sloth
instructs
me
antonio
o
if
you
but
knew
how
you
the
purpose
cherish
whiles
thus
you
mock
it
how
in
stripping
it
you
more
invest
it
ebbing
men
indeed
most
often
do
so
near
the
bottom
run
by
their
own
fear
or
sloth
sebastian
prithee
say
on
the
setting
of
thine
eye
and
cheek
proclaim
a
matter
from
thee
and
a
birth
indeed
which
throes
thee
much
to
yield
antonio
thus
sir
although
this
lord
of
weak
remembrance
this
who
shall
be
of
as
little
memory
when
he
is
earth
hath
here
almost
for
he
a
spirit
of
persuasion
only
professes
to
king
his
son
alive
is
as
impossible
that
he
as
he
that
sleeps
here
swims
sebastian
i
have
no
hope
that
he
undrown
antonio
o
out
of
that
what
great
hope
have
you
no
hope
that
way
is
another
way
so
high
a
hope
that
even
ambition
can
not
pierce
a
wink
beyond
but
doubt
discovery
there
will
you
grant
with
me
that
ferdinand
is
drown

me
who

slow
till

be
rough
and
razorable
she
that
from
whom
we
all
were
though
some
cast
again
and
by
that
destiny
to
perform
an
act
whereof

obedient
steel
three
inches
of

clock
to
any
business
that
we
say
befits
the
hour

hollow
burst
of

rather
lions

you
it
struck
mine
ear
most
terribly
alonso
i
heard
nothing

a
din
to
fright
a
monster

to
make
an
earthquake

the
roar
of
a
whole
herd
of
lions
alonso

mine
honour

humming

strange
one
too
which

awake
me
i
shak
you
sir
and
cried
as
mine
eyes
open
i
saw
their
weapons

a
noise

upon
our
guard
or
that
we
quit
this
place

draw
our
weapons

noise
of
thunder

the
infections
that
the
sun
sucks
up
from
bogs
fens
flats
on
prosper
fall
and
make
him
by
a
disease
his
spirits
hear
me
and
yet
i
needs
must
curse
but
they
nor
pinch
fright
me
with
pitch
me
i
th
mire
nor
lead
me
like
a
firebrand
in
the
dark
out
of
my
way
unless
he
bid
but
for
every
trifle
are
they
set
upon
me
sometime
like
apes
that
mow
and
chatter
at
me
and
after
bite
me
then
like
hedgehogs
which
lie
tumbling
in
my
barefoot
way
and
mount
their
pricks
at
my
footfall
sometime
am
i
all
wound
with
adders
who
with
cloven
tongues
do
hiss
me
into
madness
enter
trinculo
lo
now
lo
here
comes
a
spirit
of
his
and
to
torment
me
for
bringing
wood
in
slowly
i
fall
flat
perchance
he
will
not
mind
me
trinculo
here
neither
bush
nor
shrub
to
bear
off
any
weather
at
all
and
another
storm
brewing
i
hear
it
sing
i
th
wind
yond
same
black
cloud
yond
huge
one
looks
like
a
foul
bombard
that
would
shed
his
liquor
if
it
should
thunder
as
it
did
before
i
know
not
where
to
hide
my
head
yond
same
cloud
can
not
choose
but
fall
by
pailfuls
what
have
we
here
a
man
or
a
fish
dead
or
alive
a
fish
he
smells
like
a
fish
a
very
ancient
and
smell
kind
of
a
strange
fish
were
i
in
england
now
as
once
i
was
and
had
but
this
fish
painted
not
a
holiday
fool
there
but
would
give
a
piece
of
silver
there
would
this
monster
make
a
man
any
strange
beast
there
makes
a
man
when
they
will
not
give
a
doit
to
relieve
a
lame
beggar
they
will
lay
out
ten
to
see
a
dead
indian
legg
like
a
man
and
his
fins
like
arms
warm
o
my
troth
i
do
now
let
loose
my
opinion
hold
it
no
longer
this
is
no
fish
but
an
islander
that
hath
lately
suffered
by
thunderbolt
thunder
alas
the
storm
is
come
again
my
best
way
is
to
creep
under
his
gaberdine
there
is
no
other
shelter
hereabout
misery
acquaints
a
man
with
strange
i
will
here
shroud

a
scurvy
tune
too
but

this

more
gentle
than

has
brave
so
he
calls
which
when
he
has
a
house

deck
withal

that
most
deeply
to
consider
is
the
beauty
of
his
daughter

himself
calls
her
a
nonpareil
i
never
saw
a
woman

only
sycorax
my

i
say
no
more
solemn
and
strange
music
and
prospero
on
the
top
invisible
enter
several
strange
shapes
bringing
in
a
banquet
and
dance
about
it
with
gentle
actions
of
salutations
and
inviting
the

to

true
travellers

though
fools
at

condemn
gonzalo
if
in
naples
i
should
report
this
now
would
they
believe
me
if
i
should
say
i
saw
such
islanders
for
certes
these
are
people
of
the
island
who
though
they
are
of
monstrous
shape
yet
note
their
manners
are
more
than
of
our
human
generation
you
shall
find
many
nay
almost
any
prospero
aside
honest
lord
thou
hast
said
well
for
some
of
you
there

are
worse
than
devils
alonso
i
can
not
too
much
muse
such
shapes
such
gesture
and
such
sound
expressing
although
they
want
the
use
of
tongue
a
kind
of
excellent
dumb
discourse
prospero
aside
praise
in
departing
francisco
they
vanish
strangely
sebastian
no
matter
since
they
have
left
their
viands
behind
for
we
have
stomachs
please
you
taste
of
what
is
here
alonso
not
gonzalo
faith
sir
you
need
not
fear
when
we
were
boys
who
would
believe
that
there
were
mountaineers
dewlapp
like
bulls
whose
throats
had
hanging
at
wallets
of
flesh
or
that
there
were
such
men
whose
heads
stood
in
their
breasts
which
now
we
find
each
of
five
for
one
will
bring
us
good
warrant
of
alonso
i
will
stand

as
we
thunder
and

enter
ariel
like
a
harpy
claps
his
wings
upon
the
table
and
with
a
quaint
device
the
banquet
vanishes
ariel
you
are
three
men
of
sin
whom
destiny
that
hath
to
instrument
this
lower
world
and
what
is
i
the

hath
caus
to
belch
up
you

doth
not
men
being

have
made
you
mad
and
even
with

men
hang
and
drown
their

selves
alonso

draw
their

you
fools
i
and
my

are
ministers
of
fate
the
elements
of

your
swords

may
as
well
wound
the
loud

or
with
stabs
kill
the
waters
as
diminish
one
dowle
that
in
my
plume
my
are
like
invulnerable
if
you
could
hurt
your
swords
are
now
too
massy
for
your
strengths
and
will
not
be
uplifted
but
for
that
my
business
to
you
three
from
milan
did
supplant
good
prospero
expos
unto
the

hath
requit
it

foul
deed
the

have
incens
the

yea
all
the
creatures
against
your
peace
thee
of
thy
son
alonso
they
have
bereft
and
do
pronounce
by
me
perdition
worse
than
any
death
can
be
at
once
shall
step
by
step
attend
you
and
your
ways
whose
wraths
to
guard
you
which
here
in
this
most
desolate
isle
else
falls
upon
your
nothing
but
heart
sorrow
and
a
clear
life
ensuing
he
vanishes
in
thunder
then
to
soft
music
enter
the
shapes
again
and
dance
with
mocks
and
mows
and
carrying
out
the
table
prospero
bravely
the
figure
of
this
harpy
hast
thou
perform
my
ariel
a
grace
it
had
devouring
of
my
instruction
hast
thou
nothing
bated
in
what
thou
hadst
to
say
so
with
good
life
and
observation
strange
my
meaner
ministers
their
several
kinds
have
done
my
high
charms
work
and
these
mine
enemies
are
all
knit
up
in
their
distractions
they
now
are
in
my
and
in
these
fits
i
leave
them
while
i
visit
young
ferdinand
whom
they
suppose
is
drown
and
his
and
mine
lov
darling
exit
above
gonzalo
i
th
name
of
something
holy
sir
why
stand
you
in
this
strange
stare
alonso
o
it
is
monstrous
monstrous
methought
the
billows
spoke
and
told
me
of
it
the
winds
did
sing
it
to
me
and
the
thunder
that
deep
and
dreadful
the
name
of
prosper
it
did
bass
my
trespass
therefore
my
son
i
th
ooze
is
bedded
and
i
seek
him
deeper
than
plummet
sounded
and
with
him
there
lie
mudded
exit
sebastian
but
one
fiend
at
a
time
i
fight
their
legions
antonio
i
be
thy
second
exeunt
sebastian
and
antonio
gonzalo
all
three
of
them
are
desperate
their
great
guilt
like
poison
given
to
work
a
great
time
after
now
gins
to
bite
the
spirits
i
do
beseech
you
that
are
of
suppler
joints
follow
them
swiftly
and
hinder
them
from
what
this
ecstasy
may
now
provoke
them
to
adrian
follow
i
pray
you
exeunt
act
iv
scene
before
prospero
cell
enter
prospero
ferdinand
and
miranda
prospero
if
i
have
too
austerely
punish
you
your
compensation
makes
amends
for
have
given
you
here
a
third
of
mine
own
life
or
that
for
which
i
live
who
once
again
i
tender
to
thy
hand
all
thy
vexations
were
but
my
trials
of
thy
love
and
thou
hast
strangely
stood
the
test
here
afore
heaven
i
ratify
this
my
rich
gift
o
ferdinand
do
not
smile
at
me
that
i
boast
her
off
for
thou
shalt
find
she
will
outstrip
all
praise
and
make
it
halt
behind
her
ferdinand
i
do
believe
it
against
an
oracle
prospero
then
as
my
gift
and
thine
own
acquisition
purchas
take
my
daughter
but
if
thou
dost
break
her
before
all
sanctimonious
ceremonies
may
with
full
and
holy
rite
be
no
sweet
aspersion
shall
the
heavens
let
fall
to
make
this
contract
grow
but
barren
hate
disdain
and
discord
shall
bestrew
the
union
of
your
bed
with
weeds
so
loathly
that
you
shall
hate
it
both
therefore
take
heed
as
hymen
lamps
shall
light
you
ferdinand
as
i
hope
for
quiet
days
fair
issue
and
long
life
with
such
love
as
is
now
the
murkiest
den
the
most
opportune
place
the
suggestion
our
worser
genius
can
shall
never
melt
mine
honour
into
lust
to
take
away
the
edge
of
that
day

this
vision
the
towers
the
gorgeous
palaces
the
solemn
temples
the
great
globe
itself
yea
all
which
it
inherit
shall
dissolve

this
insubstantial
pageant
faded
leave
not
a
rack
behind
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep

how
sharp
the
point
of
this
remembrance
is
my

i
am
woe
sir
alonso
irreparable
is
the
loss
and
patience
says
it
is
past
her
cure
prospero
i
rather
think
you

not
sought

soft
grace
for
the
like
loss
i
have
her
sovereign
aid
and
rest
myself
content
alonso

as
great
to
me
as

much
weaker

when
did
you
lose
your
daughter
prospero
in
this
last
tempest
i
perceive
these
lords
at
this
encounter

so
much
admire
that
they
devour
their
reason
and
scarce
think
their
eyes
do
offices
of
truth
their
words
are
natural
breath
but
you
have
been
justled
from
your
senses

for
certain
that
i
am
prospero
and
that
very
duke
which
was
thrust
forth
of
milan
who
most
strangely
upon
this
shore
where
you
were
wrecked
was
landed
to
be
the
lord
o
no
more
yet
