how
can
i
make
mention
of
thee
assured
as
i
am
that
no
tongue
however
deep
its
wisdom
can
befittingly
magnify
thy
name
nor
can
the
bird
of
the
human
heart
however
great
its
longing
ever
hope
to
ascend
into
the
heaven
of
thy
majesty
and
knowledge
if
i
describe
thee
o
my
god
as
him
who
is
the
i
find
myself
compelled
to
admit
that
they
who
are
the
highest
embodiments
of
perception
have
been
created
by
virtue
of
thy
behest
and
if
i
extol
thee
as
him
who
is
the
i
likewise
am
forced
to
recognize
that
the
well
springs
of
wisdom
have
themselves
been
generated
through
the
operation
of
thy
will
and
if
i
proclaim
thee
as
the
incomparable
one
i
soon
discover
that
they
who
are
the
inmost
essence
of
oneness
have
been
sent
down
by
thee
and
are
but
the
evidences
of
thine
handiwork
and
if
i
acclaim
thee
as
the
knower
of
all
things
i
must
confess
that
they
who
are
the
quintessence
of
knowledge
are
but
the
creation
and
instruments
of
thy
purpose
exalted
immeasurably
exalted
art
thou
above
the
strivings
of
mortal
man
to
unravel
thy
mystery
to
describe
thy
glory
or
even
to
hint
at
the
nature
of
thine
essence
for
whatever
such
strivings
may
accomplish
they
never
can
hope
to
transcend
the
limitations
imposed
upon
thy
creatures
inasmuch
as
these
efforts
are
actuated
by
thy
decree
and
are
begotten
of
thine
invention
the
loftiest
sentiments
which
the
holiest
of
saints
can
express
in
praise
of
thee
and
the
deepest
wisdom
which
the
most
learned
of
men
can
utter
in
their
attempts
to
comprehend
thy
nature
all
revolve
around
that
center
which
is
wholly
subjected
to
thy
sovereignty
which
adoreth
thy
beauty
and
is
propelled
through
the
movement
of
thy
pen
nay
forbid
it
o
my
god
that
i
should
have
uttered
such
words
as
must
of
necessity
imply
the
existence
of
any
direct
relationship
between
the
pen
of
thy
revelation
and
the
essence
of
all
created
things
far
far
are
they
who
are
related
to
thee
above
the
conception
of
such
relationship
all
comparisons
and
likenesses
fail
to
do
justice
to
the
tree
of
thy
revelation
and
every
way
is
barred
to
the
comprehension
of
the
manifestation
of
thy
self
and
the
day
spring
of
thy
beauty
far
far
from
thy
glory
be
what
mortal
man
can
affirm
of
thee
or
attribute
unto
thee
or
the
praise
with
which
he
can
glorify
thee
whatever
duty
thou
hast
prescribed
unto
thy
servants
of
extolling
to
the
utmost
thy
majesty
and
glory
is
but
a
token
of
thy
grace
unto
them
that
they
may
be
enabled
to
ascend
unto
the
station
conferred
upon
their
own
inmost
being
the
station
of
the
knowledge
of
their
own
selves
no
one
else
besides
thee
hath
at
any
time
been
able
to
fathom
thy
mystery
or
befittingly
to
extol
thy
greatness
unsearchable
and
high
above
the
praise
of
men
wilt
thou
remain
for
ever
there
is
none
other
god
but
thee
the
inaccessible
the
omnipotent
the
omniscient
the
holy
of
holies
ii
the
beginning
of
all
things
is
the
knowledge
the
beginning
of
all
things
is
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
end
of
all
things
is
strict
observance
of
whatsoever
hath
been
sent
down
from
the
empyrean
of
the
divine
will
that
pervadeth
all
that
is

the
revelation
which
from
time
immemorial
the
revelation
which
from
time
immemorial
hath
been
acclaimed
as
the
purpose
and
promise
of
all
the
prophets
of
god
and
the
most
cherished
desire
of
his
messengers
hath
now
by
virtue
of
the
pervasive
will
of
the
almighty
and
at
his
irresistible
bidding
been
revealed
unto
men
the
advent
of
such
a
revelation
hath
been
heralded
in
all
the
sacred
scriptures
behold
how
notwithstanding
such
an
announcement
mankind
hath
strayed
from
its
path
and
shut
out
itself
from
its
glory
say
o
ye
lovers
of
the
one
true
god
strive
that
ye
may
truly
recognize
and
know
him
and
observe
befittingly
his
precepts
this
is
a
revelation
under
which
if
a
man
shed
for
its
sake
one
drop
of
blood
myriads
of
oceans
will
be
his
recompense
take
heed
o
friends
that
ye
forfeit
not
so
inestimable
a
benefit
or
disregard
its
transcendent
station
consider
the
multitude
of
lives
that
have
been
and
are
still
being
sacrificed
in
a
world
deluded
by
a
mere
phantom
which
the
vain
imaginations
of
its
peoples
have
conceived
render
thanks
unto
god
inasmuch
as
ye
have
attained
unto
your
heart
s
desire
and
been
united
to
him
who
is
the
promise
of
all
nations
guard
ye
with
the
aid
of
the
one
true
be
his
integrity
of
the
station
which
ye
have
attained
and
cleave
to
that
which
shall
promote
his
cause
he
verily
enjoineth
on
you
what
is
right
and
conducive
to
the
exaltation
of
man

this
wondrous
tablet
iv
this

most
excellent
this
is
the
day
in

god

most
excellent

have
been
poured
out
upon
men
the
day
in
which
his
most
mighty
grace
hath
been
infused
into
all

things
it
is
incumbent
upon
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
to
reconcile
their
differences
and
with
perfect
unity

peace
abide
beneath
the
shadow

it
behoveth

whatsoever

in

be
conducive

the

happy
are
those
whom
the

was
moved
to
remember
and
blessed
are
those
men
whose
names
by
virtue
of
our
inscrutable
decree
we
have
preferred
to
conceal
beseech
ye
the
one
true
god
to
grant
that
all
men
may
be
graciously
assisted
to

which

spread
out

searched
the

hid
within

fathomed
their
import
can
be
said
to
have
discovered
a
glimmer

the
unspeakable
glory

this

richer

turned
away
from
his
face
of
god
himself
reflect
what
could
have
been
the
motive
for
such
deeds
what
could
have
prompted
such
behavior
towards
the
revealers
of
the
beauty
of
the
whatever
in
days
gone
by
hath
been
the
cause
of
the
denial
and
opposition
of
those
people
hath
now
led
to
the
perversity
of
the
people
of
this
age
to
maintain
that
the
testimony
of
providence
was
incomplete
that
it
hath
therefore
been
the
cause
of
the
denial
of
the
people
is
but
open
blasphemy
how
far
from
the
grace
of
the
and
from
his
loving
providence
and
tender
mercies
it
is
to
single
out
a
soul
from
amongst
all
men
for
the
guidance
of
his
creatures
and
on
one
hand
to
withhold
from
him
the
full
measure
of
his
divine
testimony
and
on
the
other
inflict
severe
retribution
on
his
people
for
having
turned
away
from
his
chosen
one
nay
the
manifold
bounties
of
the
lord
of
all
beings
have
at
all
times
through
the
manifestations
of
his
divine
essence
encompassed
the
earth
and
all
that
dwell
therein
not
for
a
moment
hath
his
grace
been
withheld
nor
have
the
showers
of
his
ceased
to
rain
upon
mankind
consequently
such
behavior
can
be
attributed
to
naught
save
the
of
such
souls
as
tread
the
valley
of
arrogance
and
pride
are
lost
in
the
wilds
of
remoteness
walk
in
the
ways
of
their
idle
fancy
and
follow
the
dictates
of
the
leaders
of
their
faith
their
chief
concern
is
mere
opposition
their
sole
desire
is
to
ignore
the
truth
unto
every
discerning
observer
it
is
evident
and
manifest
that
had
these
people
in
the
days
of
each
of
the
manifestations
of
the
sun
of
truth
sanctified
their
eyes
their
ears
and
their
hearts
from
whatever
they
had
seen
heard
and
felt
they
surely
would
not
have
been
deprived
of
beholding
the
beauty
of
god
nor
strayed
far
from
the
habitations
of
glory
but
having
weighed
the
testimony
of
god
by
the
standard
of
their
own
knowledge
gleaned
from
the
teachings
of
the
leaders
of
their
faith
and
found
it
at
variance
with
their
limited
understanding
they
arose
to
perpetrate
such
unseemly
acts
consider
moses
armed
with
the
rod
of
celestial
dominion
adorned
with
the
white
hand
of
divine
knowledge
and
proceeding
from
the
párán
of
the
love
of
god
and
wielding
the
serpent
of
power
and
everlasting
majesty
he
shone
forth
from
the
sinai
of
light
upon
the
world
he
summoned
all
the
peoples
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
to
the
kingdom
of
eternity
and
invited
them
to
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
faithfulness
surely
you
are
aware
of
the
fierce
opposition
of
pharaoh
and
his
people
and
of
the
stones
of
idle
fancy
which
the
hands
of
infidels
cast
upon
that
blessed
tree
so
much
so
that
pharaoh
and
his
people
finally
arose
and
exerted
their
utmost
endeavor
to
extinguish
with
the
waters
of
falsehood
and
denial
the
fire
of
that
sacred
tree
oblivious
of
the
truth
that
no
earthly
water
can
quench
the
flames
of
divine
wisdom
nor
mortal
blasts
extinguish
the
lamp
of
everlasting
dominion
nay
rather
such
water
can
not
but
intensify
the
burning
of
the
flame
and
such
blasts
can
not
but
ensure
the
preservation
of
the
lamp
were
ye
to
observe
with
the
eye
of
discernment
and
walk
in
the
way
of
god
s
holy
will
and
pleasure
and
when
the
days
of
moses
were
ended
and
the
light
of
jesus
shining
forth
from
the
day
spring
of
the
spirit
encompassed
the
world
all
the
people
of
israel
arose
in
protest
against
him
they
clamored
that
he
whose
advent
the
bible
had
foretold
must
needs
promulgate
and
fulfil
the
laws
of
moses
whereas
this
youthful
nazarene
who
laid
claim
to
the
station
of
the
divine
messiah
had
annulled
the
laws
of
divorce
and
of
the
sabbath
most
weighty
of
all
the
laws
of
moses
moreover
what
of
the
signs
of
the
manifestation
yet
to
come
these
people
of
israel
are
even
unto
the
present
day
still
expecting
that
manifestation
which
the
bible
hath
foretold
how
many
manifestations
of
holiness
how
many
revealers
of
the
light
everlasting
have
appeared
since
the
time
of
moses
and
yet
israel
wrapt
in
the
densest
veils
of
satanic
fancy
and
false
imaginings
is
still
expectant
that
the
idol
of
her
own
handiwork
will
appear
with
such
signs
as
she
herself
hath
conceived
thus
hath
god
laid
hold
of
them
for
their
sins
hath
extinguished
in
them
the
spirit
of
faith
and
tormented
them
with
the
flames
of
the
nethermost
fire
and
this
for
no
other
reason
except
that
israel
refused
to
apprehend
the
meaning
of
such
words
as
have
been
revealed
in
the
bible
concerning
the
signs
of
the
coming
revelation
as
she
never
grasped
their
true
significance
and
to
outward
seeming
such
events
never
came
to
pass
she
therefore
remained
deprived
of
recognizing
the
beauty
of
jesus
and
of
beholding
the
face
of
god
and
they
still
await
his
coming
from
time
immemorial
even
unto
this
day
all
the
kindreds
and
peoples
of
the
earth
have
clung
to
such
fanciful
and
unseemly
thoughts
and
thus
have
deprived
themselves
of
the
clear
waters
streaming
from
the
springs
of
purity
and
holiness
to
them
that
are
endowed
with
understanding
it
is
clear
and
manifest
that
when
the
fire
of
the
love
of
jesus
consumed
the
veils
of
jewish
limitations
and
his
authority
was
made
apparent
and
partially
enforced
he
the
revealer
of
the
unseen
beauty
addressing
one
day
his
disciples
referred
unto
his
passing
and
kindling
in
their
hearts
the
fire
of
bereavement
said
unto
them
i
go
away
and
come
again
unto
and
in
another
place
he
said
i
go
and
another
will
come
who
will
tell
you
all
that
i
have
not
told
you
and
will
fulfil
all
that
i
have
both
these
sayings
have
but
one
meaning
were
ye
to
ponder
upon
the
manifestations
of
the
unity
of
god
with
divine
insight
every
discerning
observer
will
recognize
that
in
the
dispensation
of
the
qur
án
both
the
book
and
the
cause
of
jesus
were
confirmed
as
to
the
matter
of
names
muḥammad
himself
declared
i
am
he
recognized
the
truth
of
the
signs
prophecies
and
words
of
jesus
and
testified
that
they
were
all
of
god
in
this
sense
neither
the
person
of
jesus
nor
his
writings
hath
differed
from
that
of
muḥammad
and
of
his
holy
book
inasmuch
as
both
have
championed
the
cause
of
god
uttered
his
praise
and
revealed
his
commandments
thus
it
is
that
jesus
himself
declared
i
go
away
and
come
again
unto
consider
the
sun
were
it
to
say
now
i
am
the
sun
of
yesterday
it
would
speak
the
truth
and
should
it
bearing
the
sequence
of
time
in
mind
claim
to
be
other
than
that
sun
it
still
would
speak
the
truth
in
like
manner
if
it
be
said
that
all
the
days
are
but
one
and
the
same
it
is
correct
and
true
and
if
it
be
said
with
respect
to
their
particular
names
and
designations
that
they
differ
that
again
is
true
for
though
they
are
the
same
yet
one
doth
recognize
in
each
a
separate
designation
a
specific
attribute
a
particular
character
conceive
accordingly
the
distinction
variation
and
unity
characteristic
of
the
various
manifestations
of
holiness
that
thou
mayest
comprehend
the
allusions
made
by
the
creator
of
all
names
and
attributes
to
the
mysteries
of
distinction
and
unity
and
discover
the
answer
to
thy
question
as
to
why
that
everlasting
beauty
should
have
at
sundry
times
called
himself
by
different
names
and
titles
when
the
unseen
the
eternal
the
divine
essence
caused
the
day
star
of
muḥammad
to
rise
above
the
horizon
of
knowledge
among
the
cavils
which
the
jewish
divines
raised
against
him
was
that
after
moses
no
prophet
should
be
sent
of
god
yea
mention
hath
been
made
in
the
scriptures
of
a
soul
who
must
needs
be
made
manifest
and
who
will
advance
the
faith
and
promote
the
interests
of
the
people
of
moses
so
that
the
law
of
the
mosaic
dispensation
may
encompass
the
whole
earth
thus
hath
the
king
of
eternal
glory
referred
in
his
book
to
the
words
uttered
by
those
wanderers
in
the
vale
of
remoteness
and
error
the
hand
of
god
say
the
jews
is
chained
chained
up
be
their
own
hands
and
for
that
which
they
have
said
they
were
accursed
nay
outstretched
are
both
his
hands
the
hand
of
god
is
above
their
although
the
commentators
of
the
qur
án
have
related
in
divers
manners
the
circumstances
attending
the
revelation
of
this
verse
yet
thou
shouldst
endeavor
to
apprehend
the
purpose
thereof
he
saith
how
false
is
that
which
the
jews
have
imagined
how
can
the
hand
of
him
who
is
the
king
in
truth
who
caused
the
countenance
of
moses
to
be
made
manifest
and
conferred
upon
him
the
robe
of
can
the
hand
of
such
a
one
be
chained
and
fettered
how
can
he
be
conceived
as
powerless
to
raise
up
yet
another
messenger
after
moses
behold
the
absurdity
of
their
saying
how
far
it
hath
strayed
from
the
path
of
knowledge
and
understanding
observe
how
in
this
day
also
all
these
people
have
occupied
themselves
with
such
foolish
absurdities
for
over
a
thousand
years
they
have
been
reciting
this
verse
and
unwittingly
pronouncing
their
censure
against
the
jews
utterly
unaware
that
they
themselves
openly
and
privily
are
voicing
the
sentiments
and
belief
of
the
jewish
people
thou
art
surely
aware
of
their
idle
contention
that
all
revelation
is
ended
that
the
portals
of
divine
mercy
are
closed
that
from
the
day
springs
of
eternal
holiness
no
sun
shall
rise
again
that
the
ocean
of
everlasting
bounty
is
forever
stilled
and
that
out
of
the
tabernacle
of
ancient
glory
the
messengers
of
god
have
ceased
to
be
made
manifest
such
is
the
measure
of
the
understanding
of
these
contemptible
people
these
people
have
imagined
that
the
flow
of
god
s
grace
and
plenteous
mercies
the
cessation
of
which
no
mind
can
contemplate
has
been
halted
from
every
side
they
have
risen
and
girded
up
the
loins
of
tyranny
and
exerted
the
utmost
endeavor
to
quench
with
the
bitter
waters
of
their
vain
fancy
the
flame
of
god
s
burning
bush
oblivious
that
the
globe
of
power
shall
within
its
own
mighty
stronghold
protect
the
lamp
of
god
behold
how
the
sovereignty
of
muḥammad
the
messenger
of
god
is
today
apparent
and
manifest
amongst
the
people
you
are
well
aware
of
what
befell
his
faith
in
the
early
days
of
his
dispensation
what
woeful
sufferings
did
the
hand
of
the
infidel
and
erring
the
divines
of
that
age
and
their
associates
inflict
upon
that
spiritual
essence
that
most
pure
and
holy
being
how
abundant
the
thorns
and
briars
which
they
have
strewn
over
his
path
it
is
evident
that
that
wretched
generation
in
their
wicked
and
satanic
fancy
regarded
every
injury
to
that
immortal
being
as
a
means
to
the
attainment
of
an
abiding
felicity
inasmuch
as
the
recognized
divines
of
that
age
such
as
abdu
abú
amír
the
hermit
ka
and
all
treated
him
as
an
impostor
and
pronounced
him
a
lunatic
and
a
calumniator
such
sore
accusations
they
brought
against
him
that
in
recounting
them
god
forbiddeth
the
ink
to
flow
our
pen
to
move
or
the
page
to
bear
them
these
malicious
imputations
provoked
the
people
to
arise
and
torment
him
and
how
fierce
that
torment
if
the
divines
of
the
age
be
its
chief
instigators
if
they
denounce
him
to
their
followers
cast
him
out
from
their
midst
and
declare
him
a
miscreant
hath
not
the
same
befallen
this
servant
and
been
witnessed
by
all
for
this
reason
did
muḥammad
cry
out
no
prophet
of
god
hath
suffered
such
harm
as
i
have
and
in
the
qur
án
are
recorded
all
the
calumnies
and
reproaches
uttered
against
him
as
well
as
all
the
afflictions
which
he
suffered
refer
ye
thereunto
that
haply
ye
may
be
informed
of
that
which
hath
befallen
his
revelation
so
grievous
was
his
plight
that
for
a
time
all
ceased
to
hold
intercourse
with
him
and
his
companions
whoever
associated
with
him
fell
a
victim
to
the
relentless
cruelty
of
his
enemies
consider
how
great
is
the
change
today
behold
how
many
are
the
sovereigns
who
bow
the
knee
before
his
name
how
numerous
the
nations
and
kingdoms
who
have
sought
the
shelter
of
his
shadow
who
bear
allegiance
to
his
faith
and
pride
themselves
therein
from
the
there
ascendeth
today
the
words
of
praise
which
in
utter
lowliness
glorify
his
blessed
name
and
from
the
heights
of
minarets
there
resoundeth
the
call
that
summoneth
the
concourse
of
his
people
to
adore
him
even
those
kings
of
the
earth
who
have
refused
to
embrace
his
faith
and
to
put
off
the
garment
of
unbelief
confess
and
acknowledge
the
greatness
and
overpowering
majesty
of
that
day
star
of
such
is
his
earthly
sovereignty
the
evidences
of
which
thou
dost
on
every
side
behold
this
sovereignty
must
needs
be
revealed
and
established
either
in
the
lifetime
of
every
manifestation
of
god
or
after
his
ascension
unto
his
true
habitation
in
the
realms
above
it
is
evident
that
the
changes
brought
about
in
every
dispensation
constitute
the
dark
clouds
that
intervene
between
the
eye
of
man
s
understanding
and
the
divine
luminary
which
shineth
forth
from
the
day
spring
of
the
divine
essence
consider
how
men
for
generations
have
been
blindly
imitating
their
fathers
and
have
been
trained
according
to
such
ways
and
manners
as
have
been
laid
down
by
the
dictates
of
their
faith
were
these
men
therefore
to
discover
suddenly
that
a
man
who
hath
been
living
in
their
midst
who
with
respect
to
every
human
limitation
hath
been
their
equal
had
risen
to
abolish
every
established
principle
imposed
by
their
by
which
for
centuries
they
have
been
disciplined
and
every
opposer
and
denier
of
which
they
have
come
to
regard
as
infidel
profligate
and
wicked
would
of
a
certainty
be
veiled
and
hindered
from
acknowledging
his
truth
such
things
are
as
clouds
that
veil
the
eyes
of
those
whose
inner
being
hath
not
tasted
the
salsabíl
of
detachment
nor
drunk
from
the
of
the
knowledge
of
god
such
men
when
acquainted
with
those
circumstances
become
so
veiled
that
without
the
least
question
they
pronounce
the
manifestation
of
god
as
infidel
and
sentence
him
to
death
you
must
have
heard
of
such
things
taking
place
all
down
the
ages
and
are
now
observing
them
in
these
days
it
behoveth
us
therefore
to
make
the
utmost
endeavor
that
by
god
s
invisible
assistance
these
dark
veils
these
clouds
of
trials
may
not
hinder
us
from
beholding
the
beauty
of
his
shining
countenance
and
that
we
may
recognize
him
only
by
his
own
self

affairs
of
the
world
have
failed
to
deter
from
recognizing
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
things
so
blind
hath
become
the
human
heart
that
neither
the
disruption
of
the
city
nor
the
reduction
of
the
mountain
in
dust
nor
even
the
cleaving
of
the
earth
can
shake
off
its
torpor
the
allusions
made
in
the
scriptures
have
been
unfolded
and
the
signs
recorded
therein
have
been
revealed
and
the
prophetic
cry
is
continually
being
raised
and
yet
all
except
such
as
god
was
pleased
to
guide
are
bewildered
in
the
drunkenness
of
their
heedlessness
witness
how
the
world
is
being
afflicted
with
a
fresh
calamity
every
day
its
tribulation
is
continually
deepening

the
moment
the

day
neither
hath
the

been
tranquillized
nor
have
the
hearts
of
its
peoples
been
at
rest
at
one
time
it
hath
been
agitated
by
contentions
and
disputes
at
another
it
hath
been
convulsed
by
wars
and
fallen
a
victim
to
inveterate
diseases
its
sickness
is
approaching
the
stage
of
utter
hopelessness
inasmuch
as
the
true
physician
is
debarred
from
administering
the
remedy
whilst
unskilled
practitioners
are
regarded
with
favor
and
are
accorded
full
freedom
to
act
the
dust
of
sedition
hath
clouded
the
hearts
of
men
and
blinded
their
eyes
erelong
they
will
perceive
the
consequences
of
what
their
hands
have
wrought
in
the
day
of

warneth
you

the

hath
been

and
all
them
that
dwell
on
earth
have
been
gathered
together
the
trumpet
hath
been
blown
and
lo
all
eyes
have
stared
up
with
terror
and
the
hearts
of
all
who
are
in
the

and
on
the

have
trembled
except
them
whom
the
breath
of
the
verses

hath
quickened
and
who
have
detached
themselves
from
all

this
is
the
day
whereon
the
earth
shall
tell
out
her
tidings
the
workers
of
iniquity
are
her
burdens
could
ye
but
perceive
it
the
moon
of
idle
fancy
hath
been
cleft
and
the
heaven
hath
given
out
a
palpable
smoke
we
see
the
people
laid
low
awed
with
the
dread
of
thy
lord
the
almighty
the
most
powerful
the
crier
hath
cried
out
and
men
have
been
torn
away
so
great
hath
been
the
fury
of
his
wrath
the
people
of
the
left
hand
sigh
and
bemoan
the
people
of
the
right
abide
in
noble
habitations
they
quaff
the
wine
that
is
life
indeed
from
the
hands
of

are
verily
the
blissful
the
earth
hath
been
shaken
and
the
mountains
have
passed
away
and
the
angels
have
appeared
rank
on
rank
before
us
most
of
the
people
are
bewildered
in
their
drunkenness
and
wear
on
their
faces
the
evidences
of
anger
thus
have
we
gathered
together
the
workers
of
iniquity
we
see
them
rushing
on
towards
their
idol
say
none
shall
be
secure
this
day
from
the
decree
of
god
this
indeed
is
a
grievous
day
we
point
out
to
them
those
that
led
them
astray
they
see
them
and
yet
recognize
them
not
their
eyes
are
drunken
they
are
indeed
a
blind
people
their
proofs
are
the
calumnies
they
uttered
condemned
are
their
calumnies
by
god
the
help
in
peril
the
the
evil
one
hath
stirred
up
mischief
in
their
hearts
and
they
are
afflicted
with
a
torment
that
none
can
avert
they
hasten
to
the
wicked
bearing
the
register
of
the
workers
of
iniquity
such
are
their
doings

the
heavens
have
been
folded
together
and
the
earth
is
held
within
his
grasp
and
the
corrupt
doers
have
been
held
by
their
forelock
and
still
they
understand
not
they
drink
of
the
tainted
water
and
know
it
not
say
the
shout
hath
been
raised
and
the
people
have
come
forth
from
their
graves
and
arising
are
gazing
around
them
some
have
made
haste
to
attain
the
court
of
the
god
of
mercy
others
have
fallen
down
on
their
faces
in
the
fire
of
hell
while
still
others
are
lost
in
bewilderment
the
verses
of
god
have
been
revealed
and
yet
they
have
turned
away
from
them
his
proof
hath
been
manifested
and
yet
they
are
unaware
of
it
and
when
they
behold
the
face
of
the
their
own
faces
are
saddened
while
they
are
disporting
themselves
they
hasten
forward
to
hell
fire
and
mistake
it
for
light
far
from
god
be
what
they
fondly
imagine
say
whether
ye
rejoice
or
whether
ye
burst
for
fury
the
heavens
are
cleft
asunder
and
god
hath
come
down
invested
with
radiant
sovereignty
all
created
things
are
heard
exclaiming
the
kingdom
is
god

thou
moreover
that
we
have
been
cast
into
an
afflictive
prison
and
are
encompassed
with
the
hosts
of
tyranny
as
a
result
of
what
the
hands
of
the
infidels
have
wrought
such
is
the
gladness
however
which
the
youth
hath
tasted
that
no
earthly
joy
can
compare
unto
it
by
god
the
harm
he
suffereth
at
the
hands

the
oppressor

never
grieve
his
heart
nor
can
he
be
saddened

it

to
every

it

that
god
the

the
divine
being
is
immensely
exalted
beyond
every
human
attribute
such
as
corporeal
existence
ascent
and
descent
egress
and
regress
far
be
it
from
his
glory
that
human
tongue
should
adequately
recount
his
praise
or
that
human
heart
comprehend
his
fathomless
mystery
he
is
and
hath
ever
been
veiled
in
the
ancient
eternity
of
his
essence
and
will
remain
in
his
reality
everlastingly
hidden
from
the
sight
of
men
no
vision
taketh

him
but
he
taketh
in
all
vision
he

the
subtile
the

door
of
the
knowledge
of
the
ancient
of
days
being
thus
closed
in
the
face
of
all
beings
the
source
of
infinite
grace
according
to
his
saying
his
grace
hath
transcended
all
things
my
grace
hath
encompassed
them
all
hath
caused
those
luminous
gems
of
holiness
to
appear
out
of

realm
of

form
of
the

unto
all
men
that
they
may
impart
unto
the
world
the
mysteries
of
the
unchangeable
being
and
tell
of
the
subtleties
of
his
imperishable
essence
these
sanctified
mirrors
these

springs
of
ancient
glory
are
one

all
the
exponents
on
earth
of
him
who

central

ultimate
purpose
from
him

their
knowledge
and
power
from
him

derived
their
sovereignty
the
beauty
of
their
countenance

a
reflection
of

image

of
his
deathless
glory
they
are
the
treasuries

wisdom
through

transmitted

infinite

that

never
fade
these
tabernacles
of

these
primal
mirrors
which

the

of
unfading

of

of

all
the

of

such
as
knowledge
and
power
sovereignty
and
dominion
mercy
and
wisdom
glory
bounty
and
grace
are
made
manifest
these
attributes
of
god
are
not
and
have
never
been
vouchsafed
specially
unto
certain
prophets
and
withheld
from
others
nay
all
the
prophets
of
god
his
his
holy
and
chosen
messengers
are
without
exception
the
bearers
of
his
names
and
the
embodiments
of
his
attributes
they
only
differ
in
the
intensity
of
their
revelation
and
the
comparative
potency
of
their
light
even
as
he
hath
revealed
some
of
the
apostles
we
have
caused
to
excel
the
it
hath
therefore
become
manifest
and
evident
that
within
the
tabernacles
of
these
prophets
and
chosen
ones
of
god
the
light
of
his
infinite
names
and
exalted
attributes
hath
been
reflected
even
though
the
light
of
some
of
these
attributes
may
or
may
not
be
outwardly
revealed
from
these
luminous
temples
to
the
eyes
of
men
that
a
certain
attribute
of
god
hath
not
been
outwardly
manifested
by
these
essences
of

doth
in
no

imply
that
they
who
are
the
day
springs
of
god
s
attributes
and
the
treasuries
of
his
holy
names
did
not
actually
possess

therefore
these

souls
these
beauteous
countenances
have
each

every
one
of

been
endowed
with
all
the
attributes
of

the

the
bearers
of
the
trust

are
made
manifest
unto
the
peoples
of
the
earth
as
the
exponents
of
a
new
cause
and
the
revealers
of
a
new
message
inasmuch
as
these
birds
of
the
celestial
throne
are
all
sent
down
from
the
heaven
of
the
will
of
god
and
as
they
all
arise
to
proclaim
his
irresistible
faith
they
therefore
are
regarded
as
one
soul
and
the
same
person
for
they
all
drink
from
the
one
cup
of
the
love
of
god
and
all
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
same
tree
of
oneness
these
manifestations
of
god
have
each
a
twofold
station
one
is
the
station
of
pure
abstraction
and
essential
unity
in
this
respect
if
thou
callest
them
all
by
one
name
and
dost
ascribe
to
them
the
same
attributes
thou
hast
not
erred
from
the
truth
even
as
he
hath
revealed
no
distinction
do
we
make
between
any
of
his
for
they
one
and
all
summon
the
people
of
the
earth
to
acknowledge
the
unity
of
god
and
herald
unto
them
the
of
an
infinite
grace
and
bounty
they
are
all
invested
with
the
robe
of
prophethood
and
are
honored
with
the
mantle
of
glory
thus
hath
muḥammad
the
point
of
the
qur
án
revealed
i
am
all
the
likewise
he
saith
i
am
the
first
adam
noah
moses
and
similar
statements
have
been
made
by
imám
alí
sayings
such
as
these
which
indicate
the
essential
unity
of
those
exponents
of
oneness
have
also
emanated
from
the
channels
of
god
s
immortal
utterance
and
the
treasuries
of
the
gems
of
divine
knowledge
and
have
been
recorded
in
the
scriptures
these
countenances
are
the
recipients
of
the
divine
command
and
the
day
springs
of
his
revelation
this
revelation
is
exalted
above
the
veils
of
plurality
and
the
exigencies
of
number
thus
he
saith
our
cause
is
but
inasmuch
as
the
cause
is
one
and
the
same
the
exponents
thereof
also
must
needs
be
one
and
the
same
likewise
the
imáms
of
the
muḥammadan
faith
those
lamps
of
certitude
have
said
muḥammad
is
our
first
muḥammad
is
our
last
muḥammad
our
it
is
clear
and
evident
to
thee
that
all
the
prophets
are
the
temples
of
the
cause
of
god
who
have
appeared
clothed
in
divers
attire
if
thou
wilt
observe
with
discriminating
eyes
thou
wilt
behold
them
all
abiding
in
the
same
tabernacle
soaring
in
the
same
heaven
seated
upon
the
same
throne
uttering
the
same
speech
and
proclaiming
the
same
faith
such
is
the
unity
of
those
essences
of
being
those
luminaries
of
infinite
and
immeasurable
splendor
wherefore
should
one
of
these
manifestations
of
holiness
proclaim
saying
i
am
the
return
of
all
the
prophets
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
in
like
manner
in
every
subsequent
revelation
the
return
of
the
former
revelation
is
a
fact
the
truth
of
which
is
firmly
established
the
other
station
is
the
station
of
distinction
and
pertaineth
to
the
world
of
creation
and
to
the
limitations
thereof
in
this
respect
each
manifestation
of
god
hath
a
distinct
individuality
a
definitely
prescribed
mission
a
predestined
revelation
and
specially
designated
limitations
each
one
of
them
is
known
by
a
different
name
is
characterized
by
a
special
attribute
fulfils
a
definite
mission
and
is
entrusted
with
a
particular
revelation
even
as
he
saith
some
of
the
apostles
we
have
caused
to
excel
the
others
to
some
god
hath
spoken
some
he
hath
raised
and
exalted
and
to
jesus
son
of
mary
we
gave
manifest
signs
and
we
strengthened
him
with
the
holy
it
is
because
of
this
difference
in
their
station
and
mission
that
the
words
and
utterances
flowing
from
these
well
springs
of
divine
knowledge
appear
to
diverge
and
differ
otherwise
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
are
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
all
their
utterances
are
in
reality
but
the
expressions
of
one
truth
as
most
of
the
people
have
failed
to
appreciate
those
stations
to
which
we
have
referred
they
therefore
feel
perplexed
and
dismayed
at
the
varying
utterances
pronounced
by
manifestations
that
are
essentially
one
and
the
same
it
hath
ever
been
evident
that
all
these
divergencies
of
utterance
are
attributable
to
differences
of
station
thus
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
their
oneness
and
sublime
detachment
the
attributes
of
godhead
divinity
supreme
singleness
and
inmost
essence
have
been
and
are
applicable
to
those
essences
of
being
inasmuch
as
they
all
abide
on
the
throne
of
divine
revelation
and
are
established
upon
the
seat
of
divine
concealment
through
their
appearance
the
revelation
of
god
is
made
manifest
and
by
their
countenance
the
beauty
of
god
is
revealed
thus
it
is
that
the
accents
of
god
himself
have
been
heard
uttered
by
these
manifestations
of
the
divine
being
viewed
in
the
light
of
their
second
station
of
distinction
differentiation
temporal
limitations
characteristics
and
manifest
absolute
servitude
utter
destitution
and
complete
even
as
he
saith
i
am
the
servant
of
god
i
am
but
a
man
like
were
any
of
the
manifestations
of
god
to
declare
i
am
god
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
and
no
doubt
attacheth
thereto
for
it
hath
been
repeatedly
demonstrated
that
through
their
revelation
their
attributes
and
names
the
revelation
of
god
his
names
and
his
attributes
are
made
manifest
in
the
world
thus
he
hath
revealed
those
shafts
were
god
s
not
and
also
he
saith
in
truth
they
who
plighted
fealty
unto
thee
really
plighted
that
fealty
unto
and
were
any
of
them
to
voice
the
utterance
i
am
the
messenger
of
god
he
also
speaketh
the
truth
the
indubitable
truth
even
as
he
saith
muḥammad
is
not
the
father
of
any
man
among
you
but
he
is
the
messenger
of
viewed
in
this
light
they
are
all
but
messengers
of
that
ideal
king
that
unchangeable
essence
and
were
they
all
to
proclaim
i
am
the
seal
of
the
prophets
they
verily
utter
but
the
truth
beyond
the
faintest
shadow
of
doubt
for
they
are
all
but
one
person
one
soul
one
spirit
one
being
one
revelation
they
are
all
the
manifestation
of
the
beginning
and
the
end
the
first
and
the
last
the
seen
and
the
hidden
of
which
pertain
to
him
who
is
the
innermost
spirit
of
spirits
and
eternal
essence
of
essences
and
were
they
to
say
we
are
the
servants
of
god
this
also
is
a
manifest
and
indisputable
fact
for
they
have
been
made
manifest
in
the
uttermost
state
of
servitude
a
servitude
the
like
of
which
no
man
can
possibly
attain
thus
in
moments
in
which
these
essences
of
being
were
deep
immersed
beneath
the
oceans
of
ancient
and
everlasting
holiness
or
when
they
soared
to
the
loftiest
summits
of
divine
mysteries
they
claimed
their
utterances
to
be
the
voice
of
divinity
the
call
of
god
himself
were
the
eye
of
discernment
to
be
opened
it
would
recognize
that
in
this
very
state
they
have
considered
themselves
utterly
effaced
and
in
the
face
of
him
who
is
the
the
incorruptible
methinks
they
have
regarded
themselves
as
utter
nothingness
and
deemed
their
mention
in
that
court
an
act
of
blasphemy
for
the
slightest
whispering
of
self
within
such
a
court
is
an
evidence
of
and
independent
existence
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
have
attained
unto
that
court
such
a
suggestion
is
itself
a
grievous
transgression
how
much
more
grievous
would
it
be
were
aught
else
to
be
mentioned
in
that
presence
were
man
s
heart
his
tongue
his
mind
or
his
soul
to
be
busied
with
any
one
but
the
were
his
eyes
to
behold
any
countenance
other
than
his
beauty
were
his
ear
to
be
inclined
to
any
melody
but
his
voice
and
were
his
feet
to
tread
any
way
but
his
way
by
virtue
of
this
station
they
have
claimed
for
themselves
the
voice
of
divinity
and
the
like
whilst
by
virtue
of
their
station
of
messengership
they
have
declared
themselves
the
messengers
of
god
in
every
instance
they
have
voiced
an
utterance
that
would
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
occasion
and
have
ascribed
all
these
declarations
to
themselves
declarations
ranging
from
the
realm
of
divine
revelation
to
the
realm
of
creation
and
from
the
domain
of
divinity
even
unto
the
domain
of
earthly
existence
thus
it
is
that
whatsoever
be
their
utterance
whether
it
pertain
to
the
realm
of
divinity
lordship
prophethood
messengership
guardianship
apostleship
or
servitude
all
is
true
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
therefore
these
sayings
which
we
have
quoted
in
support
of
our
argument
must
be
attentively
considered
that
the
divergent
utterances
of
the
manifestations
of
the
unseen
and
day
springs
of
holiness
may
cease
to
agitate
the
soul
and
perplex
the
mind
xxiii
consider

generations
witness
consider
the
former
generations
witness
how
every
time
the
day
star
of
divine
bounty
hath
shed
the
light
of
his
revelation
upon
the
world
the
people
of
his
day
have
arisen
against
him
and
repudiated
his
truth
they
who
were
regarded
as
the
leaders

men
have
invariably
striven
to
hinder
their
followers
from
turning
unto
him
who
is
the
ocean

s
limitless
bounty
behold
how
the
people
as
a
result
of
the
verdict
pronounced
by
the
divines
of
his
age
have
cast
abraham
the
friend
of
god
into
fire
how
moses
he
who
held
converse
with
the
almighty
was
denounced
as
liar
and
slanderer
reflect
how
jesus
the
spirit
of
god
was
notwithstanding
his
extreme
meekness
and
perfect
treated
by
his
enemies
so
fierce
was
the
opposition
which
he
the
essence
of
being
and
lord
of
the
visible
and
invisible
had
to
face
that
he
had
nowhere
to
lay
his
head
he
wandered
continually
from
place
to
place
deprived
of
a
permanent
abode
ponder
that
which
befell
muḥammad
the
seal
of
the
prophets
may
the
life
of
all
else
be
a
sacrifice
unto
him
how
severe
the
afflictions
which
the
leaders
of
the
jewish
people
and
of
the
caused
to
rain
upon
him
who
is
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
in
consequence
of
his
proclamation
of
the
unity
of
god
and
of
the
truth
of
his
message
by
the
righteousness
of
my
cause
my
pen
groaneth
and
all
created
things
weep
with
a
great
weeping
as
a
result
of
the
woes
he
suffered
at
the
hands
of
them
that
have
broken
the
covenant
of
god
violated
his
testament
rejected
his
proofs
and
disputed
his
signs
thus
recount
we
unto
thee
the
tale
of
that
which
happened
in
days
past
haply
thou
mayest
comprehend
thou
hast
known
how
grievously
the
prophets
of
god
his
messengers
and
chosen
ones
have
been
afflicted

a
while
on
the
motive
and
reason
which
have
been
responsible
for
such
a
persecution
at
no
time
in
no
dispensation
have
the
prophets
of
god
escaped
the
blasphemy
of
their
enemies
the
cruelty
of
their
oppressors
the
denunciation
of
the
learned
of
their
age
who
appeared
in
the
guise
of
uprightness
and
piety
day
and
night
they
passed
through
such
agonies
as
none
can
ever
measure
except
the
knowledge
of
the
one
true
god
exalted

his
glory
consider
this
wronged
one
though
the
clearest
proofs
attest
the
truth
of
his
cause
though
the
prophecies
he
in
an
unmistakable
language
hath
made
have
been
fulfilled

in

of
his
not
being
accounted
among

being
unschooled

inexperienced
in

current
among

hath
rained
upon

the
showers

manifold
and

behold
how

hath
rejected
his
authority
and
rebelled
against

hath
during
the
greater
part

so
unjustly
thrown

thou
mayest
observe
the
things

have
come

pondering
them
in

a

wafted

invested

a

hath
through

are
potentially
present
in

the
radiance

may
be

desires
even
as
the

can
be
concealed
beneath

which
cover

neither

can
be
lighted
through
their
own
unaided
efforts
nor
can
it
ever
be
possible
for
the
mirror
to
free
itself
from
its
dross
it
is
clear
and
evident
that
until

is

the

will
never
be

unless

from

it

glory
and
since
there
can
be
no
tie
of
direct
intercourse
to
bind
the
one
true
god
with
his
creation
and
no
resemblance
whatever
can
exist
between
the
transient
and
the
eternal
the
contingent

the
absolute
he
hath
ordained
that
in

a
pure
and
stainless
soul
be
made
manifest
in
the
kingdoms
of
earth
and
heaven
unto
this
subtle
this
mysterious
and
ethereal
being
he
hath
assigned
a
twofold
nature
the
physical
pertaining
to
the
world
of
matter
and
the
spiritual
which
is
born
of
the
substance
of
god
himself
he
hath
moreover
conferred
upon
him
a
double
station
the
first
station
which
is
related
to
his
innermost
reality
representeth
him
as
one
whose
voice
is
the
voice
of
god
himself
to
this
testifieth

station

verses
i

a

praise
be
to
my
lord
am
i
more
than
a

these
essences
of
detachment
these
resplendent
realities
are
the
channels
of
god
s
grace
led
by
the
light
of
unfailing
guidance
and
invested
with
supreme
sovereignty
they
are
commissioned
to
use
the
inspiration
of
their
words
the
effusions
of
their
infallible
grace
and
the
sanctifying
breeze
of
their
revelation
for
the
cleansing
of
every
longing
heart
and
receptive
spirit
from
the
dross
and
dust
of
earthly
cares
and
limitations
then
and
only
then
will
the
trust
of
god
latent
in
the
reality
of
man
emerge
as
resplendent
as
the
rising
orb
of
divine
revelation
from
behind
the
veil
of
concealment
and
implant
the
ensign
of
its
revealed
glory
upon
the
summits
of
men
s
hearts
from
the
foregoing
passages
and
allusions
it
hath
been
made
indubitably
clear
that
in
the
kingdoms
of
earth
and
heaven
there
must
needs
be
manifested
a
being
an
essence
who
shall
act
as
a
manifestation
and
vehicle
for
the
transmission
of
the
grace
of
the
divinity
itself
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
through
the
teachings
of
this
day
star
of
truth
every
man
will
advance
and
develop
until
he
attaineth
the
station
at
which
he
can
manifest
all
the
potential
forces
with
which
his
inmost
true
self
hath
been
endowed
it
is
for
this
very
purpose
that
in
every
age
and
dispensation
the
prophets
of
god
and
his
chosen
ones
have
appeared
amongst
men
and
have
evinced
such
power
as
is
born
of
god
and
such
might
as
only
the
eternal
can
reveal
can
one
of
sane
mind
ever
seriously
imagine
that
in
view
of
certain
words
the
meaning
of
which
he
can
not
comprehend
the
portal
of

infinite
guidance

ever

he
ever
conceive
for
these

luminaries
these
resplendent
lights
either
a

an

what
outpouring
flood
can
compare
with
the
stream
of
his
grace
and
what
blessing
can
excel
the
evidences
of
so
great
and
pervasive
a
mercy
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
if
for
one
moment
the
tide
of
his
mercy
and
grace
were
to
be
withheld
from
the
world
it
would
completely
perish
for
this
reason
from
the
beginning

all
created
things
would
be
so
dazzled
and
thunderstruck
by
the
evidences
of
his
light
as
to
be
reduced
to
utter
nothingness
how
then
can
the
godly
be
differentiated
under
such
circumstances
from
the
froward
this
principle
hath
operated
in
each
of
the
previous
dispensations

been
abundantly
demonstrated
it

for
this
reason
that
in
every
age
when
a
new
manifestation
hath
appeared
and
a
fresh
revelation
of
god

transcendent
power
was
vouchsafed
unto

that
misbelieved
in

deluded
by
the
appearance

the
peerless

everlasting
beauty
in
the
garb
of
mortal
men
have
failed
to
recognize
him
they
have
erred
from
his
path
and
eschewed
his
company
of
him
who
is
the
symbol
of
nearness
to
god
they
have
even
arisen
to
decimate
the
ranks
of
the
faithful
and
to
exterminate
such
as
believed
in
him
behold
how
in
this
dispensation
the
worthless
and
foolish
have
fondly
imagined
that
by
such
instruments
as
massacre
plunder
and
banishment
they
can
extinguish
the

the

of

power
hath
lit

under

be
dissociated
from

in
thine
esteemed
letter
thou
hadst
inquired
which
of
the

should
be
regarded
as
superior
to
others
know
thou
assuredly
that
the
essence
of
all
the
prophets
of
god
is
one
and
the
same
their
unity
is
absolute
god
the
creator
saith
there
is
no
distinction
whatsoever
among
the
bearers
of
my
message
they
all
have
but
one
purpose
their
secret
is
the
same
secret
to
prefer
one
in
honor
to
another
to
exalt
certain
ones
above
the
rest
is
in
no
wise
to
be
permitted
every
true
prophet
hath
regarded
his
message
as
fundamentally
the
same
as
the
revelation
of
every
other
prophet
gone
before
him
if
any
man
therefore
should
fail
to
comprehend
this
truth
and
should
consequently
indulge
in
vain
and
unseemly
language
no
one
whose
sight
is
keen
and
whose
understanding
is
enlightened
would
ever
allow
such
idle
talk
to
cause
him
to
waver
in
his
belief
the
measure
of
the
revelation
of
the
prophets
of
god
in
this
world
however
must
differ
each
and
every
one
of
them
hath
been
the
bearer
of
a
distinct
message
and
hath
been
commissioned
to
reveal
himself
through
specific
acts
it
is
for
this
reason
that
they
appear
to
vary
in
their
greatness
their
revelation
may
be
likened
unto
the
light
of
the
moon
that
sheddeth
its
radiance
upon
the
earth
though
every
time
it
appeareth
it
revealeth
a
fresh
measure
of
its
brightness
yet
its
inherent
splendor
can
never
diminish
nor
can
its
light
suffer
extinction
it
is
clear
and
evident
therefore
that
any
apparent
variation
in
the
intensity
of
their
light
is
not
inherent
in
the
light
itself
but
should
rather
be
attributed
to
the
varying
receptivity
of
an
world
every
prophet
whom
the
almighty
and
peerless
creator
hath
purposed
to
send
to
the
peoples
of
the
earth
hath
been
entrusted
with
a
message
and
charged
to
act
in
a
manner
that
would
best
meet
the
requirements
of
the
age
in
which
he
appeared
god
s
purpose
in
sending
his
prophets
unto
men
is
twofold
the
first
is
to
liberate
the
children
of
men
from
the
darkness
of
ignorance
and
guide
them
to
the
light
of
true
understanding
the
second
is
to
ensure
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
mankind
and
provide
all
the
means
by
which
they
can
be
established
the
prophets
of
god
should
be
regarded
as
physicians
whose
task
is
to
foster
the
of
the
world
and
its
peoples
that
through
the
spirit
of
oneness
they
may
heal
the
sickness
of
a
divided
humanity
to
none
is
given
the
right
to
question
their
words
or
disparage
their
conduct
for
they
are
the
only
ones
who
can
claim
to
have
understood
the
patient
and
to
have
correctly
diagnosed
its
ailments
no
man
however
acute
his
perception
can
ever
hope
to
reach
the
heights
which
the
wisdom
and
understanding
of
the
divine
physician
have
attained
little
wonder
then
if
the
treatment
prescribed
by
the
physician
in
this
day
should
not
be
found
to
be
identical
with
that
which
he
prescribed
before
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
the
ills
affecting
the
sufferer
necessitate
at
every
stage
of
his
sickness
a
special
remedy
in
like
manner
every
time
the
prophets
of
god
have
illumined
the
world
with
the
resplendent
radiance
of
the
day
star
of
divine
knowledge
they
have
invariably
summoned
its
peoples
to
embrace
the
light
of
god
through
such
means
as
best
befitted
the
exigencies
of
the
age
in
which
they
appeared
they
were
thus
able
to
scatter
the
darkness
of
ignorance
and
to
shed
upon
the
world
the
glory
of
their
own
knowledge
it
is
towards
the
inmost
essence
of
these
prophets
therefore
that
the
eye
of
every
man
of
discernment
must
be
directed
inasmuch
as
their
one
and
only
purpose
hath
always
been
to
guide
the
erring
and
give
peace
to
the
afflicted
these
are
not
days
of
prosperity
and
triumph
the
whole
of
mankind
is
in
the
grip
of
manifold
ills
strive
therefore
to
save
its
life
through
the
wholesome
medicine
which
the
almighty
hand
of
the
unerring
physician
hath
prepared
and
now
concerning
thy
question
regarding
the
nature
of
religion
know
thou
that
they
who
are
truly
wise
have
likened
the
world
unto
the
human
temple
as
the
body
of
man
needeth
a
garment
to
clothe
it
so
the
body
of
mankind
must
needs
be
adorned
with
the
mantle
of
justice
and
wisdom
its
robe
is
the
revelation
vouchsafed
unto
it
by
god
whenever
this
robe
hath
fulfilled
its
purpose
the
almighty
will
assuredly
renew
it
for
every
age
requireth
a
fresh
measure
of
the
light
of
god
every
divine
revelation
hath
been
sent
down
in
a
manner
that
befitted
the
circumstances
of
the
age
in
which
it
hath
appeared
as
to
thy
question
regarding
the
sayings
of
the
leaders
of
past
religions
every
wise
and
praiseworthy
man
will
no
doubt
eschew
such
vain
and
profitless
talk
the
incomparable
creator
hath
created
all
men
from
one
same
substance
and
hath
exalted
their
reality
above
the
rest
of
his
creatures
success
or
failure
gain
or
loss
must
therefore
depend
upon
man
s
own
exertions
the
more
he
striveth
the
greater
will
be
his
progress
we
fain
would
hope
that
the
vernal
showers
of
the
bounty
of
god
may
cause
the
flowers
of
true
understanding
to
spring
from
the
soil
of
men
s
hearts
and
may
wash
them
from
all
earthly
defilements

in
those
days
he
who
is
the
eternal
truth
manifesteth
himself
in
conformity
with
that
which
he
himself
hath
purposed
and
not
according
to
the
desires
and
expectations
of
men
even
as
he
hath
revealed
so
oft
then
as
an
apostle
cometh
to
you
with
that
which
your
souls
desire
not
do
ye
swell
with
pride
and
treat
some
as
impostors
and

can
be
no

whatever
that
had
these
apostles
appeared
in
bygone
ages
and
cycles
in

with
the
vain
imaginations
which
the
hearts
of
men
had
devised
no
one
would
have
repudiated
the
truth
of
these
sanctified
beings
though
such
men
have
been
night
and
day
remembering
the
one
true
god
and
have
been
devoutly
engaged
in
the
exercise
of
their
devotions
yet
they
failed
in
the
end
to
recognize
and
partake
of
the
grace
of
the
day
springs
of
the
signs
of
god
and
the
manifestations
of
his
irrefutable
evidences
to
this
the
scriptures
bear
witness
thou
hast
no
doubt
heard
about
it
consider
the
dispensation
of
jesus
christ
behold
how
all
the
learned
men
of
that
generation
though
eagerly
anticipating
the
coming
of
the
promised
one
have
nevertheless
denied
him
both
annas
the
most
learned
among
the
divines
of
his
day
and
caiaphas
the
high
priest
denounced
him
and
pronounced
the
sentence
of
his
death
in
like
manner
when
muḥammad
the
prophet
of
all
men
be
a
sacrifice
unto
the
learned
men
of
mecca
and
medina
arose
in
the
early
days
of
his
revelation
against
him
and
rejected
his
message
while
they
who
were
destitute
of
all
learning
recognized
and
embraced
his
faith
ponder
a
while
consider
how
balál
the
ethiopian
unlettered
though
he
was
ascended
into
the
heaven
of
faith
and
certitude
whilst
abdu
lláh
ubayy
a
leader
among
the
learned
maliciously
strove
to
oppose
him
behold
how
a
mere
shepherd
was
so
carried
away
by
the
ecstasy
of
the
words
of
god
that
he
was
able
to
gain
admittance
into
the
habitation
of
his
and
was
united
to
him
who
is
the
lord
of
mankind
whilst
they
who
prided
themselves
on
their
knowledge
and
wisdom
strayed
far
from
his
path
and
remained
deprived
of
his
grace
for
this
reason
he
hath
written
he
that
is
exalted
among
you
shall
be
abased
and
he
that
is
abased
shall

references
to
this
theme
are
to
be

in
most
of
the
heavenly
books
as
well
as
in
the
sayings
of
the
prophets

i

such
is
the

springtime
of

in

who
is
the
object
of
all

with
absolute
detachment
from

learning
of

lift
up
your

by
the

revelation
the
very
moment
ye

ye
will
witness
how
a

the

him
an
exile
a

of
tyranny
in
this
most
great
prison
his
enemies
have
assailed
him
on
every
side
and
will
continue
to
do
so
till
the

the
incalculable
afflictions

thou
didst
cast

of

ungodly
for
no
reason

that
i
was
moved
to
whisper
into
the
ears
of
the
denizens
of
thy
kingdom
an
intimation
of
the
vision
with
which
thou
hadst
through
thy
knowledge
inspired
me
and
revealed
to
me
its
meaning
through
the
potency
of
thy
might
and
again
thou
didst
decree
that
i
be
beheaded
by

infidel
again
i
was
crucified
for
having
unveiled
to
men

the
hidden
gems

how
bitter
the

heaped
upon

in

on
the

how
lonely
did
i
feel
amidst
thy
people
to
what
a
state
of
helplessness
i
was
reduced
in
that
land
unsatisfied
with
such
indignities
my
persecutors
decapitated
me
and
carrying
aloft
my
head
from
land
to
land
paraded
it
before
the
gaze
of
the
unbelieving
multitude
and
deposited
it
on
the
seats
of

perverse

faithless
in

was
made

riddled
with

in
this

my
treacherous
enemies
have
leagued
themselves
against

are
continually
plotting
to
instill
the
venom
of
hate

malice
into
the
souls
of
thy
servants

all
their

are
scheming
to

is
my
plight

render
thanks
unto
thee
and
my
spirit
is
grateful
for
whatsoever
hath
befallen
me
in
the
path
of
thy
i
am
well
pleased
with
that
which
thou
didst
ordain
for

calamitous
the

hast
breathed
thy

divorced
me
from

than
a
faint
reflection
a

this

hath
invited
all

to

your

why

those
which
accord

your
rejection

on

in
your
judgment
o
ye
ministers
of

what
is
it
that
we
have
committed
that
could
justify
our
banishment
what
is
the
offense
that
hath
warranted
our
expulsion
it
is
we
who
have
sought
you
and
yet
behold
how
ye
refused
to
receive
us
by

this

a
sore
injustice

thou
didst
behold
at
the
time
of
thine
arrival
in
the
city
that
thy
testimony
may
endure
amongst
men
and
serve
as
a
warning
unto
them
that
believe
we
found
upon
our
arrival
in
the
city
its
governors
and
elders
as
children
gathered
about
and
disporting
themselves
with
clay
we
perceived
no
one
sufficiently
mature
to
acquire
from
us
the
truths
which
god
hath
taught
us
nor
ripe
for
our
wondrous
words
of
wisdom
our
inner
eye
wept
sore
over
them
and
over
their
transgressions
and
their
total
disregard
of
the
thing
for
which
they
were
created
this
is
what
we
observed
in
that
city
and
which
we
have
chosen
to
note
down
in
our
book
that
it
may
serve
as
a
warning
unto
them
and
unto
the
rest
of
mankind
say
if
ye
be
seekers
after
this
life
and
the
vanities
thereof
ye
should
have
sought
them
while
ye
were
still
enclosed
in
your
mothers
wombs
for
at
that
time
ye
were
continually
approaching
them
could
ye
but
perceive
it
ye
have
on
the
other
hand
ever
since
ye
were
born
and
attained
maturity
been
all
the
while
receding
from
the
world
and
drawing
closer
to
dust
why
then
exhibit
such
greed
in
amassing
the
treasures
of
the
earth
when
your
days
are
numbered
and
your
chance
is
lost
will
ye
not
then
o
heedless
ones
shake
off
your
slumber
incline
your
ears
to
the
counsels
which
this
servant
giveth
you
for
the
sake
of
god
he
verily
asketh
no
recompense
from
you
and
is
resigned
to
what
god
hath
ordained
for
him
and
is
entirely
submissive
to
god
s
will
the
days
of
your
life
are
far
spent
o
people
and
your
end
is
fast
approaching
put
away
therefore
the
things
ye
have
devised
and
to
which
ye
cleave
and
take
firm
hold
on
the
precepts
of
god
that
haply
ye
may
attain
that
which
he
hath
purposed
for
you
and
be
of
them
that
pursue
a
right
course
delight
not
yourselves
in
the
things
of
the
world
and
its
vain
ornaments
neither
set
your
hopes
on
them
let
your
reliance
be
on
the
remembrance
of
god
the
most
exalted
the
most
great
he
will
erelong
bring
to
naught
all
the
things
ye
possess
let
him
be
your
fear
and
forget
not
his
covenant
with
you
and
be
not
of
them
that
are
shut
out
as
by
a
veil
from
him
beware
that
ye
swell
not
with
pride
before
god
and
disdainfully
reject
his
loved
ones
defer
ye
humbly
to
the
faithful
they
that
have
believed
in
god
and
in
his
signs
whose
hearts
witness
to
his
unity
whose
tongues
proclaim
his
oneness
and
who
speak
not
except
by
his
leave
thus
do
we
exhort
you
with
justice
and
warn
you
with
truth
that
perchance
ye
may
be
awakened
lay
not
on
any
soul
a
load
which
ye
would
not
wish
to
be
laid
upon
you
and
desire
not
for
any
one
the
things
ye
would
not
desire
for
yourselves
this
is
my
best
counsel
unto
you
did
ye
but
observe
it
respect
ye
the
divines
and
learned
amongst
you
they
whose
conduct
accords
with
their
professions
who
transgress
not
the
bounds
which
god
hath
fixed
whose
judgments
are
in
conformity
with
his
behests
as
revealed
in
his
book
know
ye
that
they
are
the
lamps
of
guidance
unto
them
that
are
in
the
heavens
and
on
the
earth
they
who
disregard
and
neglect
the
divines
and
learned
that
live
amongst
have
truly
changed
the
favor
with
which
god
hath
favored
them
say
await
ye
till
god
will
have
changed
his
favor
unto
you
nothing
whatsoever
escapeth
him
he
knoweth
the
secrets
both
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
his
knowledge
embraceth
all
things
rejoice
not
in
what
ye
have
done
or
will
do
in
the
future
nor
delight
in
the
tribulation
with
which
ye
have
afflicted
us
for
ye
are
unable
by
such
means
as
these
to
exalt
your
stations
were
ye
to
examine
your
works
with
acute
discernment
neither
will
ye
be
capable
of
detracting
from
the
loftiness
of
our
state
nay
god
will
add
unto
the
recompense
with
which
he
shall
reward
us
for
having
sustained
with
persevering
patience
the
tribulations
we
have
suffered
he
verily
shall
increase
the
reward
of
them
that
endure
with
patience
know
ye
that
trials
and
tribulations
have
from
time
immemorial
been
the
lot
of
the
chosen
ones
of
god
and
his
beloved
and
such
of
his
servants
as
are
detached
from
all
else
but
him
they
whom
neither
merchandise
nor
traffic
beguile
from
the
remembrance
of
the
almighty
they
that
speak
not
till
he
hath
spoken
and
act
according
to
his
commandment
such
is
god
s
method
carried
into
effect
of
old
and
such
will
it
remain
in
the
future
blessed
are
the
steadfastly
enduring
they
that
are
patient
under
ills
and
hardships
who
lament
not
over
anything
that
befalleth
them
and
who
tread
the
path
of
resignation
the
day
is
approaching
when
god
will
have
raised
up
a
people
who
will
call
to
remembrance
our
days
who
will
tell
the
tale
of
our
trials
who
will
demand
the
restitution
of
our
rights
from
them
that
without
a
tittle
of
evidence
have
treated
us
with
manifest
injustice
god
assuredly
dominateth
the
lives
of
them
that
wronged
us
and
is
well
aware
of
their
doings
he
will
most
certainly
lay
hold
on
them
for
their
sins
he
verily
is
the
fiercest
of
avengers
thus
have
we
recounted
unto
you
the
tales
of
the
one
true
god
and
sent
down
unto
you
the
things
he
had
preordained
that
haply
ye
may
ask
forgiveness
of
him
may
return
unto
him
may
truly
repent
may
realize
your
misdeeds
may
shake
off
your
slumber
may
be
roused
from
your
heedlessness
may
atone
for
the
things
that
have
escaped
you
and
be
of
them
that
do
good
let
him
who
will
acknowledge
the
truth
of
my
words
and
as
to
him
that
willeth
not
let
him
turn
aside
my
sole
duty
is
to
remind
you
of
your
failure
in
duty
towards
the
cause
of
god
if
perchance
ye
may
be
of
them
that
heed
my
warning
wherefore
hearken
ye
unto
my
speech
and
return
ye
to
god
and
repent
that
he
through
his
grace
may
have
mercy
upon
you
may
wash
away
your
sins
and
forgive
your
trespasses
the
greatness
of
his
mercy
surpasseth
the
fury
of
his
wrath
and
his
grace
encompasseth
all
who
have
been
called
into
being
and

the
congregation
of
the

of
that
land
had
delegated
to

who
when
attaining
our

questioned
us
concerning
certain
sciences
and
whom
we
answered
by
virtue
of
the
knowledge
we
inherently
possess
thy
lord
is
verily
the
knower
of
things
unseen
we
testify
said
he
that
the
knowledge
thou
dost
possess
is
such
as
none
can
rival
such
a
knowledge
however
is
insufficient
to
vindicate
the
exalted
station
which
the
people
ascribe
to
thee
produce
if
thou
speakest
the
truth
what
the
combined
forces
of
the
peoples
of
the

are
powerless

was
it
irrevocably
decreed
in
the
court
of
the

of
thy
lord

the
loving

is

thou
seest
he
was
dumbfounded

when

he
said

o

of

any

ye

and
ask
your

the
god
of
mercy
to
reveal
it
unto
you
if
he

your
wish
by

of
his
sovereignty

then
in
him
and
be

those
that

dawn
of

broken

he
and
the
testimony

arose
and
returned
unto
them
that
sent
him
at
the
bidding
of
god
the
the
days
passed
and
he
failed
to
come
back
to
us
eventually
there
came
another
messenger
who
informed
us
that
the
people
had
given
up
what
they
originally
had
purposed
they
are
indeed
a
contemptible
people
this
is
what
happened
in
iráq
and
to
what
i
reveal
i
myself
am
witness
this
happening
was
noised
abroad
yet
none
was
found
to
comprehend
its
meaning
thus
did
we
ordain
it
would
that
ye
knew
this
by
my
self
whoso
hath
in
bygone
ages
asked
us
to
produce

no

we
revealed

repudiated

the
people
however
have
for
the
most

if

of
the
true

whose
existence

are
to

as
the

is
hidden
at

it
is
evident
that
the
loftiest
mansions
in
the
realm
of
immortality
have
been
ordained
as
the
habitation
of
them
that

truly
believed

inflexible
purpose
through
the
mere
revelation
of
the
word
fashioner
issuing
forth
from
his
lips

to
mankind
such

released
as

generate
through

ages
all
the
manifold
arts
which
the
hands
of

can
produce
this

a
certain
truth
no

is
this
resplendent
word
uttered

its
animating
energies
stirring
within
all
created
things
give
birth
to
the
means

instruments
whereby
such
arts
can
be
produced

wondrous
achievements

the
direct
consequences
of
the
revelation
of
this
name
in
the
days
to
come
ye
will
verily
behold
things
of
which
ye
have
never
heard
before
thus
hath
it
been
decreed
in
the
tablets
of
god
and
none
can
comprehend
it
except
them
whose
sight
is
sharp
in
like
manner
the
moment
the
word
expressing
my
attribute
the
omniscient
issueth
forth
from
my
mouth
every
created
thing
will
according
to
its
capacity
and
limitations
be
invested
with
the
power
to
unfold
the
knowledge
of
the
most
marvelous
sciences
and
will
be
empowered
to
manifest
them
in
the
course
of
time
at
the
bidding
of
him
who
is
the
almighty

know
thou
of
a
certainty
that
the
revelation
of
every
other
name
is
accompanied
by
a
similar
manifestation
of
divine
power
every
single
letter
proceeding
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
is
indeed
a
mother
letter
and
every
word
uttered
by
him
who
is
the
well
spring
of
divine
revelation
is
a
mother
word
and
his
tablet
a
mother
tablet
well
is
it
with
them
that
apprehend
this
truth
lxxv
tear
asunder
in
my
name
the
veils
that
tear
asunder
in
my
name
the
veils
that
have
grievously
blinded
your
vision
and
through
the
power
born
of
your
belief
in
the
unity
of
god
scatter
the
idols
of
vain
imitation
enter
then
the
holy
paradise
of
the
of
the
sanctify
your
souls
from
whatsoever
is
not
of
god
and
taste
ye
the
sweetness
of
rest
within
the
pale
of
his
vast
and
mighty
revelation
and
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
supreme
and
infallible
authority
suffer
not
yourselves
to
be
wrapt
in
the
dense
veils
of
your
selfish
desires
inasmuch
as
i
have
perfected
in
every
one
of
you
my
creation
so
that
the
excellence
of
my
handiwork
may
be
fully
revealed
unto
men
it
follows
therefore
that
every
man
hath
been
and
will
continue
to
be
able
of
himself
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
god
the
glorified
had
he
not
been
endowed
with
such
a
capacity
how
could
he
be
called
to
account
for
his
failure
if
in
the
day
when
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
will
be
gathered
together
any
man
should
whilst
standing
in
the
presence
of
god
be
asked
wherefore
hast
thou
disbelieved
in
my
beauty
and
turned
away
from
my
self
and
if
such
a
man
should
reply
and
say
inasmuch
as
all
men
have
erred
and
none
hath
been
found
willing
to
turn
his
face
to
the
truth
i
too
following
their
example
have
grievously
failed
to
recognize
the
beauty
of
the
eternal
such
a
plea
will
assuredly
be
rejected
for
the
faith
of
no
man
can
be
conditioned
by
any
one
except
himself
this
is
one
of
the
verities
that
lie
enshrined
in
my
verity
which
i
have
revealed
in
all
the
heavenly
books
which
i
have
caused
the
tongue
of
grandeur
to
utter
and
the
pen
of
power
to
inscribe
ponder
a
while
thereon
that
with
both
your
inner
and
outer
eye
ye
may
perceive
the
subtleties
of
divine
wisdom
and
discover
the
gems
of
heavenly
knowledge
which
in
clear
and
weighty
language
i
have
revealed
in
this
exalted
and
incorruptible
tablet
and
that
ye
may
not
stray
far
from
the
throne
from
the
tree
beyond
which
there
is
no
passing
from
the
habitation
of
everlasting
might
and
glory
the
signs
of
god

as
manifest
and
resplendent
as
the
sun
amidst
the
works
of
his
creatures
whatsoever
proceedeth
from
him
is
apart
and
will
always
remain
distinguished
from
the
inventions
of
men
from
the
source
of
his
knowledge
countless
luminaries
of
learning
and
wisdom
have
risen
and
out
of
the
paradise
of
his
pen
the
breath
of
the
hath
continually
been
wafted
to
the
hearts
and
souls
of
men
happy
are
they
that
have
recognized
this
truth

my
servant
unto
that
which
give

o
my
servant
unto
that
which
is
being
sent
down
unto
thee
from
the
throne
of
thy
lord
the
inaccessible
the
most
great
there
is
none
other
god
but
him
he
hath
called
into
being
his
creatures
that
they
may
know
him
who
is
the
compassionate
the
unto
the
cities
of
all
nations
he
hath
sent
his
messengers
whom
he
hath
commissioned
to
announce
unto
men
tidings
of
the
paradise
of
his
good
pleasure
and
to
draw
them
nigh
unto
the
haven
of
abiding
security
the
seat
of
eternal
holiness
and
transcendent
glory
some
were
guided
by
the
light
of
god
gained
admittance
into
the
court
of
his
presence
and
quaffed
from
the
hand
of
resignation
the
waters
of
everlasting
life
and
were
accounted
of
them
that
have
truly
recognized
and
believed
in
him
others
rebelled
against
him
and
rejected
the
signs
of
god
the
most
powerful
the
almighty
the
ages
rolled
away
until
they
attained
their
consummation
in
this
the
lord
of
days
the
day
whereon
the
day
star
of
the
bayán
manifested
itself
above
the
horizon
of

the
day
in

the
beauty

shone
forth
in
the
exalted
person
of
the
báb
no
sooner
did
he
reveal
himself
than
all
the
people
rose
up
against
him
by
some
he
was
denounced
as
one
that
hath
uttered
slanders
against
god
the
almighty
the
ancient
of
days
others
regarded
him
as
a
man
smitten
with
madness
an
allegation
which
i
myself
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
one
of
the
divines
still
others
disputed
his
claim
to
be
the
mouthpiece
of
god
and
stigmatized
him
as
one
who
had
stolen
and
used
as
his
the
words
of
the
almighty
who
had
perverted
their
meaning
and
mingled
them
with
his
own
the
eye
of
grandeur
weepeth
sore
for
the
things
which
their
mouths
have
uttered
while
they
continue
to
rejoice
upon
their
seats

rather
at

hath
sent
down
unto
you

will
be
better
for
you
than
the
whole
of

repeat
the
gaze
o

and
consider
the
testimony
of
god
and
his
proof
which
are
in
your
possession
and
compare
them
unto
the
revelation
sent
down
unto
you
in
this
day
that
the
truth
the
infallible
truth
may
be
indubitably
manifested

what
would
it
profit
man
if
he
were
to
fail
to
recognize
the
revelation
of
god
nothing
whatever
to
this
mine
own
self
the
omnipotent
the
omniscient
the

the
more
he
exhorted
them
the
fiercer
grew
their
enmity
till
at
the
last
they
put
him
to
death
with
shameful
cruelty
the
curse
of
god
be
upon
the
oppressors
a
few
believed
in
him
few
of
our
servants
are
the
thankful
these
he
admonished
in
all
his
in
every
passage
of
his
wondrous
to
give
themselves
up
in
the
day
of
the
promised
revelation
to
anything
whatever
be
it
in
the
heaven
or
in
the
earth
o
people
said
he
i
have
revealed
myself
for
his
manifestation
and
have
caused
my
book
the
bayán
to
descend
upon
you
for
no
other
purpose
except
to
establish
the
truth
of
his
cause
fear
ye
god
and
contend
not
with
him
as
the
people
of
the
qur
án
have
contended
with
me
at
whatever
time
ye
hear
of
him
hasten
ye
towards
him
and
cleave
ye
to
whatsoever
he
may
reveal
unto
you
naught
else
besides
him
can
ever
profit
you
no
not
though
ye
produce
from
first
to
last
the
testimonies
of
all
those
who
were
before
and
when
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
the
heaven
of
divine
decree
was
cleft
asunder
and
the
beauty
of
the
báb
appeared
in
the
clouds
of
the
names
of
god
arrayed
in
a
new
raiment
these
same
people
maliciously
rose
up
against
him
whose
light
embraceth
all
created
things
they
broke
his
covenant
rejected
his
truth
contended
with
him
caviled
at
his
signs
treated
his
testimony
as
falsehood
and
joined
the
company
of
the
infidels
eventually
they
determined
to
take
away
his
life
such
is
the
state
of
them
who
are
in
a
error
and
when
they
realized
their
powerlessness
to
achieve
their
purpose
they
arose
to
plot
against
him
witness
how
every
moment
they
devise
a
fresh
device
to
harm
him
that
they
may
injure
and
dishonor
the
cause
of
god
say
woe
be
to
you
by
god
your
schemings
cover
you
with
shame
your
lord
the
god
of
mercy
can
well
dispense
with
all
creatures
nothing
whatever
can
either
increase
or
diminish
the
things
he
doth
possess
if
ye
believe
to
your
own
behoof
will
ye
believe
and
if
ye
believe
not
ye
yourselves
will
suffer
at
no
time
can
the
hand
of
the
infidel
profane
the
hem
of
his
robe
o
my
servant
that
believest
in
god
by
the
righteousness
of
the
almighty
were
i
to
recount
to
thee
the
tale
of
the
things
that
have
befallen
me
the
souls
and
minds
of
men
would
be
incapable
of
sustaining
its
weight
god
himself
beareth
me
witness
watch
over
thyself
and
follow
not
the
footsteps
of
these
people
meditate
diligently
upon
the
cause
of
thy
lord
strive
to
know
him
through
his
own
self
and
not
through
others
for
no
one
else
besides
him
can
ever
profit
thee
to
this
all
created
things
will
testify
couldst
thou
but
perceive
it
emerge
from
behind
the
veil
by
the
leave
of
thy
lord
the
the
most
powerful
and
seize
before
the
eyes
of
those
who
are
in
the
heavens
and
those
who
are
on
the
earth
the
chalice
of
immortality
in
the
name
of
thy
lord
the
inaccessible
the
most
high
and
quaff
thy
fill
and
be
not
of
them
that
tarry
i
swear
by
god
the
moment
thou
touchest
the
cup
with
thy
lips
the
concourse
on
high
will
acclaim
thee
saying
drink
with
healthy
relish
o
man
that
hast
truly
believed
in
god
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
cities
of
immortality
will
cry
out
joy
be
to
thee
o
thou
that
hast
drained
the
cup
of
his
love
and
the
tongue
of
grandeur
will
hail
thee
great
is
the
blessedness
that
awaiteth
thee
o
my
servant
for
thou
hast
attained
unto
that
which
none
hath
attained
except
such
as
have
detached
themselves
from
all
that
is
in
the
heavens
and
all
that
is
on
the
earth
and
who
are
the
emblems
of
true
lxxvii
and
now
concerning
thy
question
regarding
and
now
concerning
thy
question
regarding
the
creation
of
man
know
thou
that
all
men
have
been
created
in
the
nature
made
by
god
the
guardian
the
unto
each
one
hath
been
prescribed
a
measure
as
decreed
in
god
s
mighty
and
guarded
tablets
all
that
which
ye
potentially
possess
can
however
be
manifested
only
as
a
result
of
your
own
volition
your
own
acts
testify
to
this
truth
consider
for
instance
that
which
hath
been
forbidden
in
the
bayán
unto
men
god
hath
in
that
book
and
by
his
behest
decreed
as
lawful
whatsoever
he
hath
pleased
to
decree
and
hath
through
the
power
of
his
sovereign
might
forbidden
whatsoever
he
elected
to
forbid
to
this
testifieth
the
text
of
that
book
will
ye
not
bear
witness
men
however
have
wittingly
broken
his
law
is
such
a
behavior
to
be
attributed
to
god
or
to
their
proper
selves
be
fair
in
your
judgment
every
good
thing
is
of
god
and
every
evil
thing
is
from
yourselves
will
ye
not
comprehend
this
same
truth
hath
been
revealed
in
all
the
scriptures
if
ye
be
of
them
that
understand
every
act
ye
meditate
is
as
clear
to
him
as
is
that
act
when
already
accomplished
there
is
none
other
god
besides
him
his
is
all
creation
and
its
empire
all
stands
revealed
before
him
all
is
recorded
in
his
holy
and
hidden
tablets
this
of
god
however
should
not
be
regarded
as
having
caused
the
actions
of
men
just
as
your
own
previous
knowledge
that
a
certain
event
is
to
occur
or
your
desire
that
it
should
happen
is
not
and
can
never
be
the
reason
for
its
occurrence
lxxviii
as
to
thy
question
concerning
the
origin
as
to
thy
question
concerning
the
origin
of
creation
know
assuredly
that
god
s
creation
hath
existed
from
eternity
and
will
continue
to
exist
forever
its
beginning
hath
had
no
beginning
and
its
end
knoweth
no
end
his
name
the
creator
presupposeth
a
creation
even
as
his
title
the
lord
of
men
must
involve
the
existence
of
a
servant
as
to
those
sayings
attributed
to
the
prophets
of
old
such
as
in
the
beginning
was
god
there
was
no
creature
to
know
him
and
the
lord
was
alone
with
no
one
to
adore
him
the
meaning
of
these
and
similar
sayings
is
clear
and
evident
and
should
at
no
time
be
misapprehended
to
this
same
truth
bear
witness
these
words
which
he
hath
revealed
god
was
alone
there
was
none
else
besides
him
he
will
always
remain
what
he
hath
ever
every
discerning
eye
will
readily
perceive
that
the
lord
is
now
manifest
yet
there
is
none
to
recognize
his
glory
by
this
is
meant
that
the
habitation
wherein
the
divine
being
dwelleth
is
far
above
the
reach
and
ken
of
any
one
besides
him
whatsoever
in
the
contingent
world
can
either
be
expressed
or
apprehended
can
never
transgress
the
limits
which
by
its
inherent
nature
have
been
imposed
upon
it
god
alone
transcendeth
such
limitations
he
verily
is
from
everlasting
no
peer
or
partner
has
been
or
can
ever
be
joined
with
him
no
name
can
be
compared
with
his
name
no
pen
can
portray
his
nature
neither
can
any
tongue
depict
his
glory
he
will
for
ever
remain
immeasurably
exalted
above
any
one
except
himself
consider
the
hour
at
which
the
supreme
manifestation
of
god
revealeth
himself
unto
men
ere
that
hour
cometh
the
ancient
being
who
is
still
unknown
of
men
and
hath
not
as
yet
given
utterance
to
the
word
of
god
is
himself
the
in
a
world
devoid
of
any
man
that
hath
known
him
he
is
indeed
the
creator
without
a
creation
for
at
the
very
moment
preceding
his
revelation
each
and
every
created
thing
shall
be
made
to
yield
up
its
soul
to
god
this
is
indeed
the
day
of
which
it
hath
been
written
whose
shall
be
the
kingdom
this
day
and
none
can
be
found
ready
to
answer
lxxix
as
to
thy
question
concerning
the
worlds
as
to
thy
question
concerning
the
worlds
of
god
know
thou
of
a
truth
that
the
worlds
of
god
are
countless
in
their
number
and
infinite
in
their
range
none
can
reckon
or
comprehend
them
except
god
the
the
consider
thy
state
when
asleep
verily
i
say
this
phenomenon
is
the
most
mysterious
of
the
signs
of
god
amongst
men
were
they
to
ponder
it
in
their
hearts
behold
how
the
thing
which
thou
hast
seen
in
thy
dream
is
after
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
fully
realized
had
the
world
in
which
thou
didst
find
thyself
in
thy
dream
been
identical
with
the
world
in
which
thou
livest
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
event
occurring
in
that
dream
to
have
transpired
in
this
world
at
the
very
moment
of
its
occurrence
were
it
so
you
yourself
would
have
borne
witness
unto
it
this
being
not
the
case
however
it
must
necessarily
follow
that
the
world
in
which
thou
livest
is
different
and
apart
from
that
which
thou
hast
experienced
in
thy
dream
this
latter
world
hath
neither
beginning
nor
end
it
would
be
true
if
thou
wert
to
contend
that
this
same
world
is
as
decreed
by
the
and
almighty
god
within
thy
proper
self
and
is
wrapped
up
within
thee
it
would
equally
be
true
to
maintain
that
thy
spirit
having
transcended
the
limitations
of
sleep
and
having
stripped
itself
of
all
earthly
attachment
hath
by
the
act
of
god
been
made
to
traverse
a
realm
which
lieth
hidden
in
the
innermost
reality
of
this
world
verily
i
say
the
creation
of
god
embraceth
worlds
besides
this
world
and
creatures
apart
from
these
creatures
in
each
of
these
worlds
he
hath
ordained
things
which
none
can
search
except
himself
the
the
do
thou
meditate
on
that
which
we
have
revealed
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
discover
the
purpose
of
god
thy
lord
and
the
lord
of
all
worlds
in
these
words
the
mysteries
of
divine
wisdom
have
been
treasured
we
have
refrained
from
dwelling
upon
this
theme
owing
to
the
sorrow
that
hath
encompassed
us
from
the
actions
of
them
that
have
been
created
through
our
words
if
ye
be
of
them
that
will
hearken
unto
our
voice
lxxx
thou
hast
asked
me
whether
man
as
apart
thou
hast
asked
me
whether
man
as
apart
from
the
prophets
of
god
and
his
chosen
ones
will
retain
after
his
physical
death
the
individuality
personality
consciousness
and
understanding
that
characterize
his
life
in
this
world
if
this
should
be
the
case
how
is
it
thou
hast
observed
that
whereas
such
slight
injuries
to
his
mental
faculties
as
fainting
and
severe
illness
deprive
him
of
his
understanding
and
consciousness
his
death
which
must
involve
the
decomposition
of
his
body
and
the
dissolution
of
its
elements
is
powerless
to
destroy
that
understanding
and
extinguish
that
consciousness
how
can
any
one
imagine
that
man
s
consciousness
and
personality
will
be
maintained
when
the
very
instruments
necessary
to
their
existence
and
function
will
have
completely
disintegrated
know
thou
that
the
soul
of
man
is
exalted
above
and
is
independent
of
all
infirmities
of
body
or
mind
that
a
sick
person
showeth
signs
of
weakness
is
due
to
the
hindrances
that
interpose
themselves
between
his
soul
and
his
body
for
the
soul
itself
remaineth
unaffected
by
any
bodily
ailments
consider
the
light
of
the
lamp
though
an
external
object
may
interfere
with
its
radiance
the
light
itself
continueth
to
shine
with
undiminished
power
in
like
manner
every
malady
afflicting
the
body
of
man
is
an
impediment
that
preventeth
the
soul
from
manifesting
its
inherent
might
and
power
when
it
leaveth
the
body
however
it
will
evince
such
ascendancy
and
reveal
such
influence
as
no
force
on
earth
can
equal
every
pure
every
refined
and
sanctified
soul
will
be
endowed
with
tremendous
power
and
shall
rejoice
with
exceeding
gladness
consider
the
lamp
which
is
hidden
under
a
bushel
though
its
light
be
shining
yet
its
radiance
is
concealed
from
men
likewise
consider
the
sun
which
hath
been
obscured
by
the
clouds
observe
how
its
splendor
appeareth
to
have
diminished
when
in
reality
the
source
of
that
light
hath
remained
unchanged
the
soul
of
man
should
be
likened
unto
this
sun
and
all
things
on
earth
should
be
regarded
as
his
body
so
long
as
no
external
impediment
interveneth
between
them
the
body
will
in
its
entirety
continue
to
reflect
the
light
of
the
soul
and
to
be
sustained
by
its
power
as
soon
as
however
a
veil
interposeth
itself
between
them
the
brightness
of
that
light
seemeth
to
lessen
consider
again
the
sun
when
it
is
completely
hidden
behind
the
clouds
though
the
earth
is
still
illumined
with
its
light
yet
the
measure
of
light
which
it
receiveth
is
considerably
reduced
not
until
the
clouds
have
dispersed
can
the
sun
shine
again
in
the
plenitude
of
its
glory
neither
the
presence
of
the
cloud
nor
its
absence
can
in
any
way
affect
the
inherent
splendor
of
the
sun
the
soul
of
man
is
the
sun
by
which
his
body
is
illumined
and
from
which
it
draweth
its
sustenance
and
should
be
so
regarded
consider
moreover
how
the
fruit
ere
it
is
formed
lieth
potentially
within
the
tree
were
the
tree
to
be
cut
into
pieces
no
sign
nor
any
part
of
the
fruit
however
small
could
be
detected
when
it
appeareth
however
it
manifesteth
itself
as
thou
hast
observed
in
its
wondrous
beauty
and
glorious
perfection
certain
fruits
indeed
attain
their
fullest
development
only
after
being
severed
from
the
tree
lxxxi
and
now
concerning
thy
question
regarding
and
now
concerning
thy
question
regarding
the
soul
of
man
and
its
survival
after
death
know
thou
of
a
truth
that
the
soul
after
its
separation
from
the
body
will
continue
to
progress
until
it
attaineth
the
presence
of
god
in
a
state
and
condition
which
neither
the
revolution
of
ages
and
centuries
nor
the
changes
and
chances
of
this
world
can
alter
it
will
endure
as
long
as
the
kingdom
of
god
his
sovereignty
his
dominion
and
power
will
endure
it
will
manifest
the
signs
of
god
and
his
attributes
and
will
reveal
his
loving
kindness
and
bounty
the
movement
of
my
pen
is
stilled
when
it
attempteth
to
befittingly
describe
the
loftiness
and
glory
of
so
exalted
a
station
the
honor
with
which
the
hand
of
mercy
will
invest
the
soul
is
such
as
no
tongue
can
adequately
reveal
nor
any
other
earthly
agency
describe
blessed
is
the
soul
which
at
the
hour
of
its
separation
from
the
body
is
sanctified
from
the
vain
imaginings
of
the
peoples
of
the
world
such
a
soul
liveth
and
moveth
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
its
creator
and
entereth
the
paradise
the
maids
of
heaven
inmates
of
the
loftiest
mansions
will
circle
around
it
and
the
prophets
of
god
and
his
chosen
ones
will
seek
its
companionship
with
them
that
soul
will
freely
converse
and
will
recount
unto
them
that
which
it
hath
been
made
to
endure
in
the
path
of
god
the
lord
of
all
worlds
if
any
man
be
told
that
which
hath
been
ordained
for
such
a
soul
in
the
worlds
of
god
the
lord
of
the
throne
on
high
and
of
earth
below
his
whole
being
will
instantly
blaze
out
in
his
great
longing
to
attain
that
most
exalted
that
sanctified
and
resplendent
station
the
nature
of
the
soul
after
death
can
never
be
described
nor
is
it
meet
and
permissible
to
reveal
its
whole
character
to
the
eyes
of
men
the
prophets
and
messengers
of
god
have
been
sent
down
for
the
sole
purpose
of
guiding
mankind
to
the
straight
path
of
truth
the
purpose
underlying
their
revelation
hath
been
to
educate
all
men
that
they
may
at
the
hour
of
death
ascend
in
the
utmost
purity
and
sanctity
and
with
absolute
detachment
to
the
throne
of
the
most
high
the
light
which
these
souls
radiate
is
responsible
for

are
like

leaveneth
the

of

constitute
the
animating
force
through
which
the
arts

have
provided

continue

supreme
moving
impulse

the

beyond
is
as
different
from
this
world
as
this
world
is
different
from
that
of
the
child
while
still
in
the
womb
of
its
mother
when
the
soul
attaineth
the
presence
of
god
it
will
assume
the
form
that
best
befitteth
its
immortality
and
is
worthy
of
its
celestial
habitation
such
an
existence
is
a
contingent
and
not
an
absolute
existence
inasmuch
as
the
former
is
preceded
by
a
cause
whilst
the
latter
is
independent
thereof
absolute
existence
is
strictly
confined
to
god
exalted
be
his
glory
well
is
it
with
them
that
apprehend
this
truth
wert
thou
to
ponder
in
thine
heart
the
behavior
of
the
prophets
of
god
thou
wouldst
assuredly
and
readily
testify
that
there
must
needs
be
other
worlds
besides
this
world
the
majority
of
the
truly
wise
and
learned
have
throughout
the
ages
as
it
hath
been
recorded
by
the
pen
of
glory
in
the
tablet
of
wisdom
borne
witness
to
the
truth
of
that
which
the
holy
writ
of
god
hath
revealed
even
the
materialists
have
testified
in
their
writings
to
the
wisdom
of
these
messengers
and
have
regarded
the
references
made
by
the
prophets
to
paradise
to
hell
fire
to
future
reward
and
punishment
to
have
been
actuated
by
a
desire
to
educate
and
uplift
the
souls
of
men
consider
therefore
how
the
generality
of
mankind
whatever
their
beliefs
or
theories
have
recognized
the
excellence
and
admitted
the
superiority
of
these
prophets
of
god
these
gems
of
detachment
are
acclaimed
by
some
as
the
embodiments
of
wisdom
while
others
believe
them
to
be
the
mouthpiece
of
god
himself
how
could
such
souls
have
consented
to
surrender
themselves
unto
their
enemies
if
they
believed
all
the
worlds
of
god
to
have
been
reduced
to
this
earthly
life
would
they
have
willingly
suffered
such
afflictions
and
torments
as
no
man
hath
ever
experienced
or
witnessed
lxxxii
thou
hast
asked
me
concerning
the
thou
hast
asked
me
concerning
the
nature
of
the
soul
know
verily
that
the
soul
is
a
sign
of
god
a
heavenly
gem
whose
reality
the
most
learned
of
men
hath
failed
to
grasp
and
whose
mystery
no
mind
however
acute
can
ever
hope
to
unravel
it
is
the
first
among
all
created
things
to
declare
the
excellence
of
its
creator
the
first
to
recognize
his
glory
to
cleave
to
his
truth
and
to
bow
down
in
adoration
before
him
if
it
be
faithful
to
god
it
will
reflect
his
light
and
will
eventually
return
unto
him
if
it
fail
however
in
its
allegiance
to
its
creator
it
will
become
a
victim
to
self
and
passion
and
will
in
the
end
sink
in
their
depths
whoso
hath
in
this
day
refused
to
allow
the
doubts
and
fancies
of
men
to
turn
him
away
from
him
who
is
the
eternal
truth
and
hath
not
suffered
the
tumult
provoked
by
the
ecclesiastical
and
secular
authorities
to
deter
him
from
recognizing
his
message
such
a
man
will
be
regarded
by
god
the
lord
of
all
men
as
one
of
his
mighty
signs
and
will
be
numbered
among
them
whose
names
have
been
inscribed
by
the
pen
of
the
most
high
in
his
book
blessed
is
he
that
hath
recognized
the
true
stature
of
such
a
soul
that
hath
acknowledged
its
station
and
discovered
its
virtues
much
hath
been
written
in
the
books
of
old
concerning
the
various
stages
in
the
development
of
the
soul
such
as
concupiscence
irascibility
inspiration
benevolence
contentment
divine
and
the
like
the
pen
of
the
most

however
is
disinclined
to
dwell
upon
them
every
soul
that
walketh
humbly
with
its
god
in
this
day
and
cleaveth
unto
him
shall
find
itself
invested
with
the
honor
and
glory
of
all
goodly
names
and
stations
when
man
is
asleep
his
soul
can
in
no
wise
be
said
to
have
been
inherently
affected
by
any
external
object
it
is
not
susceptible
of
any
change
in
its
original
state
or
character
any
variation
in
its
functions
is
to
be
ascribed
to
external
causes
it
is
to
these
external
influences
that
any
variations
in
its
environment
its
understanding
and
perception
should
be
attributed
consider
the
human
eye
though
it
hath
the
faculty
of
perceiving
all
created
things
yet
the
slightest
impediment
may
so
obstruct
its
vision
as
to
deprive
it
of
the
power
of
discerning
any
object
whatsoever
magnified

the
name
of
him
who
hath
created

of
these
causes
who
hath
ordained
that
every
change
and
variation
in
the
world
of
being
be
made
dependent
upon
them
every
created
thing
in
the
whole
universe
is
but
a
door
leading
into
his
knowledge
a
sign
of
his
sovereignty
a
revelation
of
his
names
a
symbol
of
his
majesty
a
token
of
his
power
a
means
of
admittance
into
his
straight
path
verily
i
say
the
human
soul
is
in
its
essence
one
of
the
signs
of
god
a
mystery
among
his
mysteries
it
is
one
of
the
mighty
signs
of
the
almighty
the
harbinger
that
proclaimeth
the
reality
of
all
the
worlds
of
god
within
it
lieth
concealed
that
which
the
world
is
now
utterly
incapable
of
apprehending
ponder
in
thine
heart
the
revelation
of
the
soul
of
god
that
pervadeth
all
his
laws
and
contrast
it
with
that
base
and
appetitive
nature
that
hath
rebelled
against
him
that
forbiddeth
men
to
turn
unto
the
lord
of
names
and
impelleth
them
to
walk
after
their
lusts
and
wickedness
such
a
soul
hath
in
truth
wandered
far
in
the
path
of
error
thou
hast
moreover
asked
me
concerning
the
state
of
the
soul
after
its
separation
from
the
body
know
thou
of
a
truth
that
if
the
soul
of
man
hath
walked
in
the
ways
of
god
it
will
assuredly
return
and
be
gathered
to
the
glory
of
the
beloved
by
the
righteousness
of
god
it
shall
attain
a
station
such
as
no
pen
can
depict
or
tongue
describe
the
soul
that
hath
remained
faithful
to
the
cause
of
god
and
stood
unwaveringly
firm
in
his
path
shall
after
his
ascension
be
possessed
of
such
power
that
all
the
worlds
which
the
almighty
hath
created
can
benefit
through
him
such
a
soul
provideth
at
the
bidding
of
the
ideal
king
and
divine
educator
the
pure
leaven
that
leaveneth
the
world
of
being
and
furnisheth
the
power
through
which
the
arts
and
wonders
of
the
world
are
made
manifest
consider
how
meal
needeth
leaven
to
be
leavened
with
those
souls
that
are
the
symbols
of
detachment
are
the
leaven
of
the
world
meditate
on
this
and
be
of
the
thankful
in
several
of
our
tablets
we
have
referred
to
this
theme
and
have
set
forth
the
various
stages
in
the
development
of
the
soul
verily
i
say
the
human
soul
is
exalted
above
all
egress
and
regress
it
is
still
and
yet
it
soareth
it
moveth
and
yet
it
is
still
it
is
in
itself
a
testimony
that
beareth
witness
to
the
existence
of
a
world
that
is
contingent
as
well
as
to
the
reality
of
a
world
that
hath
neither
beginning
nor

behold
how
the
dream
thou
hast
dreamed
is
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
before
thine
eyes
consider
how
strange
is
the
mystery
of
the
world
that
appeareth
to
thee
in
thy
dream
ponder
in
thine
heart
upon
the
unsearchable
wisdom
of
god
and
meditate
on
its
manifold
revelations
witness
the
wondrous
evidences
of
god
s
handiwork
and
reflect
upon
its
range
and
character
he
who
is
the
seal
of
the
prophets
hath
said
increase
my
wonder
and
amazement
at
thee
o
god
as
to
thy
question
whether
the
physical
world
is
subject
to
any
limitations
know
thou
that
the
comprehension
of
this
matter
dependeth
upon
the
observer
himself
in
one
sense
it
is
limited
in
another
it
is
exalted
beyond
all
limitations
the
one
true
god
hath
everlastingly
existed
and
will
everlastingly
continue
to
exist
his
creation
likewise
hath
had
no
beginning
and
will
have
no
end
all
that
is
created
however
is
preceded
by
a
cause
this
fact
in
itself
establisheth
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
unity
of
the
creator
thou
hast
moreover
asked
me
concerning
the
nature
of
the
celestial
spheres
to
comprehend
their
nature
it
would
be
necessary
to
inquire
into
the
meaning
of
the
allusions
that
have
been
made
in
the
books
of
old
to
the
celestial
spheres
and
the
heavens
and
to
discover
the
character
of
their
relationship
to
this
physical
world
and
the
influence
which
they
exert
upon
it
every
heart
is
filled
with
wonder
at
so
bewildering
a
theme
and
every
mind
is
perplexed
by
its
mystery
god
alone
can
fathom
its
import
the
learned
men
that
have
fixed
at
several
thousand
years
the
life
of
this
earth
have
failed
throughout
the
long
period
of
their
observation
to
consider
either
the
number
or
the
age
of
the
other
planets
consider
moreover
the
manifold
divergencies
that
have
resulted
from
the
theories
propounded
by
these
men
know
thou
that
every
fixed
star
hath
its
own
planets
and
every
planet
its
own
creatures
whose
number
no
man
can
compute

fixed
thine
eyes

my
countenance

than

its

be

indubitably
clear

evident
that

of
these
instruments
has
depended

ever
continue

its

would
be
wholly
untrue

that
this

is
the

as
the
power
of

inasmuch

the
power
of
vision
is
derived
from
it

acteth
in
dependence
upon
it

would
likewise
be
idle
to
contend
that
this
faculty
can
be
identified
with
the
sense
of
hearing
as
the
sense
of
hearing
receiveth
from
the
rational
faculty
the
requisite
energy
for
performing

of

the

the

messenger
who
speaketh
naught
but
the
truth
hath
announced
unto
you
the

wherefore
are
ye

dejected
why

he
who

he
who

stillness

is
now
manifest
before
your

behold
how
in
this
day
the
beginning
is
reflected
in
the
end
how
out
of
stillness
motion
hath
been
engendered
this
motion
hath
been
generated
by
the
potent
energies
which
the
words
of
the
almighty
have
released
throughout
the
entire
creation
whoso
hath
been
quickened
by
its
vitalizing
power
will
find
himself
impelled
to
attain
the
court
of
the
beloved
and
whoso
hath
deprived
himself
therefrom
will
sink
into
irretrievable
despondency
he
is
truly
wise
whom
the
world
and
all
that
is
therein
have
not
deterred
from
recognizing
the
light
of
this
day
who
will
not
allow
men
s
idle
talk
to
cause
him
to
swerve
from
the
way
of
righteousness
he
is
indeed
as
one
dead
who
at
the
wondrous
dawn
of
this
revelation
hath
failed
to
be
quickened
by
its
breeze
he
is
indeed
a
captive
who
hath
not
recognized
the
supreme
redeemer
but
hath
suffered
his
soul
to
be
bound
distressed
and
helpless
in
the
fetters
of
his
desires
o
my
servants
whoso
hath
tasted
of
this
fountain
hath
attained
unto
everlasting
life
and
whoso
hath
refused
to
drink
therefrom
is
even
as
the
dead
say
o
ye
workers
of
iniquity
covetousness
hath
hindered
you
from
giving
a
hearing
ear
unto
the
sweet
voice
of
him
who
is
the
wash

away
from
your

that
his
divine
secret
may
be
made

him
manifest
and
resplendent
as
the
sun
in
all
its
glory
say
o
ye
that
are
bereft
of

a
severe
trial
pursueth
you
and
will
suddenly

haply
it
may

inflict
no

of

lxxxvi
and
now
concerning
thy
question
and
now
concerning
thy
question
whether
human
souls
continue
to
be
conscious
one
of
another
after
their
separation
from
the
body
know
thou
that
the
souls
of
the
people
of
bahá
who
have
entered
and
been
established
within
the
crimson
ark
shall
associate
and
commune
intimately
one
with
another
and
shall
be
so
closely
associated
in
their
lives
their
aspirations
their
aims
and
strivings
as
to
be
even
as
one
soul
they
are
indeed
the
ones
who
are
who
are
and
who
are
endued
with
understanding
thus
hath
it
been
decreed
by
him
who
is
the
the
the
people
of
bahá
who
are
the
inmates
of
the
ark
of
god
are
one
and
all
well
aware
of
one
another
s
state
and
condition
and
are
united
in
the
bonds
of
intimacy
and
fellowship
such
a
state
however
must
depend
upon
their
faith
and
their
conduct
they
that
are
of
the
same
grade
and
station
are
fully
aware
of
one
another
s
capacity
character
accomplishments
and
merits
they
that
are
of
a
lower
grade
however
are
incapable
of
comprehending
adequately
the
station
or
of
estimating
the
merits
of
those
that
rank
above
them
each
shall
receive
his
share
from
thy
lord
blessed
is
the
man
that
hath
turned
his
face
towards
god
and
walked
steadfastly
in
his
love
until
his
soul
hath
winged
its
flight
unto
god
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
the
most
powerful
the
the
the
souls
of
the
infidels
however
to
this
i
bear
breathing
their
last

made
aware
of
the
good
things
that
have
escaped
them
and
shall
bemoan
their
plight
and
shall
humble
themselves
before
god
they
shall
continue
doing
so
after
the
separation
of
their
souls
from
their
bodies
it
is
clear
and
evident
that
all
men
shall
after
their
physical
death
estimate
the
worth
of
their
deeds
and
realize
all
that
their
hands
have
wrought
i
swear
by
the
day
star
that
shineth
above
the
horizon
of
divine
power
they
that
are
the
followers
of
the
one
true
god
shall
the
moment
they
depart
out
of
this
life
experience
such
joy
and
gladness
as
would
be
impossible
to
describe
while
they
that
live
in
error
shall
be
seized
with
such
fear
and
trembling
and
shall
be
filled
with
such
consternation
as
nothing
can
exceed
well
is
it
with
him
that
hath
quaffed
the
choice
and
incorruptible
wine
of
faith
through
the
gracious
favor
and
the
manifold
bounties
of
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
faiths
this
is
the
day
when
the
loved
ones
of
god
should
keep
their
eyes
directed
towards
his
manifestation
and
fasten
them
upon
whatsoever
that
manifestation
may
be
pleased
to
reveal
certain
traditions
of
bygone
ages
rest
on
no
foundations
whatever
while
the
notions
entertained
by
past
generations
and
which
they
have
recorded
in
their
books
have
for
the
most
part
been
influenced
by
the
desires
of
a
corrupt
inclination
thou
dost
witness
how
most
of
the
commentaries
and
interpretations
of
the
words
of
god
now
current
amongst
men
are
devoid
of
truth
their
falsity
hath
in
some
cases
been
exposed
when
the
intervening
veils
were
rent
asunder
they
themselves
have
acknowledged
their
failure
in
apprehending
the
meaning
of
any
of
the
words
of
god
our
purpose
is
to
show
that
should
the
loved
ones
of
god
sanctify
their
hearts
and
their
ears
from
the
vain
sayings
that
were
uttered
aforetime
and
turn
with
their
inmost
souls
to
him
who
is
the
day
spring
of
his
revelation
and
to
whatsoever
things
he
hath
manifested
such
behavior
would
be
regarded
as
highly
meritorious
in
the
sight
of
god
magnify
his
name
and
be
thou
of
the
thankful
convey
my
greetings
to
my
loved
ones
whom
god
hath
singled
out
for
his
love
and
caused
them
to
achieve
their
objects
all
glory
be
to
god
the
lord
of
all
worlds
lxxxvii
and
now
regarding
thy
question
how
and
now
regarding
thy
question
how
is
it
that
no
records
are
to
be
found
concerning
the
prophets
that
have
preceded
adam
the
father
of
mankind
or
of
the
kings
that
lived
in
the
days
of
those
prophets
know
thou
that
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
them
is
no
proof
that
they
did
not
actually
exist
that
no
records
concerning
them
are
now
available
should
be
attributed
to
their
extreme
remoteness
as
well
as
to
the
vast
changes
which
the
earth
hath
undergone
since
their
time
moreover
such
forms
and
modes
of
writing
as
are
now
current
amongst
men
were
unknown
to
the
generations
that
were
before
adam
there
was
even
a
time
when
men
were
wholly
ignorant
of
the
art
of
writing
and
had
adopted
a
system
entirely
different
from
the
one
which
they
now
use
for
a
proper
exposition
of
this
an
elaborate
explanation
would
be
required
consider
the
differences
that
have
arisen
since
the
days
of
adam
the
divers
and
languages
now
spoken
by
the
peoples
of
the
earth
were
originally
unknown
as
were
the
varied
rules
and
customs
now
prevailing
amongst
them
the
people
of
those
times
spoke
a
language
different
from
those
now
known
diversities
of
language
arose
in
a
later
age
in
a
land
known
as
babel
it
was
given
the
name
babel
because
the
term
signifieth
the
place
where
the
confusion
of
tongues
subsequently
syriac
became
prominent
among
the
existing
languages
the
sacred
scriptures
of
former
times
were
revealed
in
that
tongue
later
abraham
the
friend
of
god
appeared
and
shed
upon
the
world
the
light
of
divine
revelation
the
language
he
spoke
while
he
crossed
the
jordan
became
known
as
hebrew
ibrání
which
meaneth
the
language
of
the
the
books
of
god
and
the
sacred
scriptures
were
then
revealed
in
that
tongue
and
not
until
after
a
considerable
lapse
of
time
did
arabic
become
the
language
of
revelation
witness
therefore
how
numerous
and
have
been
the
changes
in
language
speech
and
writing
since
the
days
of
adam
how
much
greater
must
have
been
the
changes
before
him
our
purpose
in
revealing
these
words
is
to
show
that
the
one
true
god
hath
in
his
and
transcendent
station
ever
been
and
will
everlastingly
continue
to
be
exalted
above
the
praise
and
conception
of
all
else
but
him
his
creation
hath
ever
existed
and
the
manifestations
of
his
divine
glory
and
the
day
springs
of
eternal
holiness
have
been
sent
down
from
time
immemorial
and
been
commissioned
to
summon
mankind
to
the
one
true
god
that
the
names
of
some
of
them
are
forgotten
and
the
records
of
their
lives
lost
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
disturbances
and
changes
that
have
overtaken
the
world
mention
hath
been
made
in
certain
books
of
a
deluge
which
caused
all
that
existed
on
earth
historical
records
as
well
as
other
things
to
be
destroyed
moreover
many
cataclysms
have
occurred
which
have
effaced
the
traces
of
many
events
furthermore
among
existing
historical
records
differences
are
to
be
found
and
each
of
the
various
peoples
of
the
world
hath
its
own
account
of
the
age
of
the
earth
and
of
its
history
some
trace
their
history
as
far
back
as
eight
thousand
years
others
as
far
as
twelve
thousand
years
to
any
one
that
hath
read
the
book
of
jük
it
is
clear
and
evident
how
much
the
accounts
given
by
the
various
books
have
differed
please
god
thou
wilt
turn
thine
eyes
towards
the
most
great
revelation
and
entirely
disregard
these
conflicting
tales
and
traditions
lxxxviii
know
verily
that
the
essence
of
justice
know
verily
that
the
essence
of
justice
and
the
source
thereof
are
both
embodied
in
the
ordinances
prescribed
by
him
who
is
the
manifestation
of
the
self
of
god
amongst
men
if
ye
be
of
them
that
recognize
this
truth
he
doth
verily
incarnate
the
highest
the
infallible
standard
of
justice
unto
all
creation
were
his
law
to
be
such
as
to
strike
terror
into
the
hearts
of
all
that
are
in
heaven
and
on
earth
that
law
is
naught
but
manifest
justice
the
fears
and
agitation
which
the
revelation
of
this
law
provokes
in
men
s
hearts
should
indeed
be
likened
to
the
cries
of
the
suckling
babe
weaned
from
his
mother
s
milk
if
ye
be
of
them
that
perceive
were
men
to
discover
the
motivating
purpose
of
god
s
revelation
they
would
assuredly
cast
away
their
fears
and
with
hearts
filled
with
gratitude
rejoice
with
exceeding
gladness
lxxxix
know
assuredly
that
just

firmly
know
assuredly
that
just
as
thou
firmly
believest
that
the
word
of
god
exalted
be
his
glory
endureth
for
ever
thou
must
likewise
believe
with
undoubting
faith
that
its
meaning
can
never
be
exhausted
they
who
are
its
appointed
interpreters
they
whose

are
the
repositories
of
its
secrets
are
however
the
only
ones
who
can
comprehend
its
manifold
wisdom
whoso
while
reading
the
sacred
scriptures
is
tempted
to
choose
therefrom
whatever
may
suit
him
with
which
to
challenge
the
authority
of
the
representative
of
god
among
men
is
indeed
as
one
dead
though
to
outward
seeming
he
may
walk
and
converse
with
his
neighbors
and
share
with
them
their
food
and
their
drink
oh
would
that
the
world
could
believe
me
were
all
the
things
that
lie
enshrined
within
the
heart
of
bahá
and
which
the
lord
his
god
the
lord
of
all
names
hath
taught
him
to
be
unveiled
to
mankind
every
man
on
earth
would
be
dumbfounded
how
great
the
multitude
of
truths
which
the
garment
of
words
can
never
contain
how
vast
the
number
of
such
verities
as
no
expression
can
adequately
describe
whose
significance
can
never
be
unfolded
and
to
which
not
even
the
remotest
allusions
can
be
made
how
manifold
are
the
truths
which
must
remain
unuttered
until
the
appointed
time
is
come
even
as
it
hath
been
said
not
everything
that
a
man
knoweth
can
be
disclosed
nor
can
everything
that
he
can
disclose
be
regarded
as
timely
nor
can
every
timely
utterance
be
considered
as
suited
to
the
capacity
of
those
who
hear
of
these
truths
some
can
be
disclosed
only
to
the
extent
of
the
capacity
of
the
repositories
of
the
light
of
our
knowledge
and
the
recipients
of
our
hidden
grace
we
beseech
god
to
strengthen
thee
with
his
power
and
enable
thee
to
recognize
him
who
is
the
source
of
all
knowledge
that
thou
mayest
detach
thyself
from
all
human
learning
for
what
would
it
profit
any
man
to
strive
after
learning
when
he
hath
already
found
and
recognized
him
who
is
the
object
of
all
knowledge
cleave
to
the
root
of
knowledge
and
to
him
who
is
the
fountain
thereof
that
thou
mayest
find
thyself
independent
of
all
who
claim
to
be
well
versed
in
human
learning
and
whose
claim
no
clear
proof
nor
the
testimony
of
any
enlightening
book
can
support
xc
whatever
is
in
the
heavens
and
whatever
is
on
whatever
is
in
the
heavens
and
whatever
is
on
the
earth
is
a
direct
evidence
of
the
revelation
within
it
of
the
attributes
and
names
of
god
inasmuch
as
within
every
atom
are
enshrined
the
signs
that
bear
eloquent
testimony
to
the
revelation
of
that
most
great
light
methinks
but
for
the
potency
of
that
revelation
no
being
could
ever
exist
how
resplendent
the
luminaries
of
knowledge
that
shine
in
an
atom
and
how
vast
the
oceans
of
wisdom
that
surge
within
a
drop
to
a
supreme
degree
is
this
true
of
man
who
among
all
created
things
hath
been
invested
with
the
robe
of
such
gifts
and
hath
been
singled
out
for
the
glory
of
such
distinction
for
in
him
are
potentially
revealed
all
the
attributes
and
names
of
god
to
a
degree
that
no
other
created
being
hath
excelled
or
surpassed
all
these
names
and
attributes
are
applicable
to
him
even
as
he
hath
said
man
is
my
mystery
and
i
am
his
manifold
are
the
verses
that
have
been
repeatedly
revealed
in
all
the
heavenly
books
and
the
holy
scriptures
expressive
of
this
most
subtle
and
lofty
theme
even
as
he
hath
revealed
we
will
surely
show
them
our
signs
in
the
world
and
within
again
he
saith
and
also
in
your
own
selves
will
ye
not
then
behold
the
signs
of
god
and
yet
again
he
revealeth
and
be
ye
not
like
those
who
forget
god
and
whom
he
hath
therefore
caused
to
forget
their
own
in
this
connection
he
who
is

from

to
the
revelation

names
and
attributes
of

within
them

and
is
expressive
of
the
knowledge
of

so
potent
and
universal
is
this
revelation
that
it
hath
encompassed
all

visible
and
invisible

amongst

demonstrating

of
this
revelation
is
this
that
in
every
age
and
dispensation
whenever
the
invisible
essence
was
revealed
in
the
person
of
his
manifestation
certain
souls
obscure
and
detached
from
all
worldly
entanglements
would
seek
illumination
from
the
sun
of
prophethood
and
moon
of
divine
guidance
and
would
attain
unto
the
divine
presence
for
this
reason
the
divines
of
the
age
and
those
possessed
of
wealth
would
scorn
and
scoff
at
these
people
even
as
he
hath
revealed
concerning
them
that
erred
then
said
the
chiefs
of
his
people
who
believed
not
we

in
thee
but
a
man
like
ourselves

we
see
not
any
who
have
followed
thee

our

ones
of
hasty
judgment
nor

we
any
excellence

ourselves

we

caviled
at
those

protested
saying
none
hath
followed
you

the
abject
amongst
us
those
who
are
worthy
of

their
aim
was
to
show
that
no
one
amongst
the
learned
the
wealthy
and
the
renowned
believed
in
them
by
this
and
similar

they
sought
to
demonstrate
the
falsity
of
him
that
speaketh
naught

the

in
this
most
resplendent
dispensation
however
this
most
mighty
sovereignty
a
number
of
illumined
divines
of
men
of
consummate
learning
of
doctors
of
mature
wisdom
have
attained
unto
his
court
drunk
the
cup
of
his
divine
presence
and
been
invested
with
the
honor
of
his
most
excellent
favor
they
have
renounced
for
the

of
the
beloved

that

therein
all
these
were
guided
by
the
light
of
the
sun
of
divine
revelation
confessed
and
acknowledged
his

such
was
their
faith
that
most
of

renounced
their

cleaved
to
the
good
pleasure
of
the
they
laid
down
their

for
their
and
surrendered
their
all

infidel
no

embodiments
of
detachment

no

that

bartered
away
immortality
for
that
which
perisheth
who
gave
up
the
of

for
salty
springs

whose
one
aim
in
life
is
to
usurp
the
property
of

as
thou
dost
witness
how
all
of
them
have
busied
themselves
with
the
vanities
of
the
world

have
strayed
far
from
him
who
is
the
lord
the
most
high
be
fair
is
the
testimony
of
those
acceptable
and
worthy
of
attention
whose
deeds
agree
with
their
words
whose
outward
behavior
conforms
with
their
inner
life
the
mind
is
bewildered
at
their
deeds
and
the
soul
marveleth
at
their
fortitude
and
bodily
endurance
or
is
the
testimony
of
these
faithless
souls
who
breathe
naught
but
the
breath
of
selfish
desire
and
who
lie
imprisoned
in
the
cage
of
their
idle
fancies
acceptable
like
the
bats
of
darkness
they
lift
not
their
heads
from
their
couch
except
to
pursue
the
transient
things
of
the
world
and
find
no
rest
by
night
except
as
they
labor
to
advance
the
aims
of
their
sordid
life
immersed
in
their
selfish
schemes
they
are
oblivious
of
the
divine
decree
in
the
daytime
they
strive
with
all
their
soul
after
worldly
benefits
and
in
the
night
season
their
sole
occupation
is
to
gratify
their
carnal
desires
by
what
law
or
standard
could
men
be
justified
in
cleaving
to
the
denials
of
such
souls
and
in
ignoring
the
faith
of
them
that
have
renounced
for
the
sake
of
the
good
pleasure
of
god
their
life
and
substance
their
fame
and
renown
their
reputation
and
honor
with
what
love
what
devotion
what
exultation
and
holy
rapture
they
sacrificed
their
lives
in
the
path
of
the
to
the
truth
of
this
all
witness
and
yet
how
can
they
belittle
this
revelation
hath
any
age
witnessed
such
momentous
happenings
if
these
companions
be
not
the
true
strivers
after
god
who
else
could
be
called
by
this
name
have
these
companions
been
seekers
after
power
or
glory
have
they
ever
yearned
for
riches
have
they
cherished
any
desire
except
the
good
pleasure
of
god
if
these
companions
with
all
their
marvelous
testimonies
and
wondrous
works
be
false
who
then
is
worthy
to
claim
for
himself
the
truth
i
swear
by
god
their
very
deeds
are
a
sufficient
testimony
and
an
irrefutable
proof
unto
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
were
men
to
ponder
in
their
hearts
the
mysteries
of
divine
revelation
and
they
who
act
unjustly
shall
soon
know
what
lot
awaiteth
them
consider
these
martyrs
of
unquestionable
sincerity
to
whose
truthfulness
testifieth
the
explicit
text
of
the
book
and
all
of
whom
as
thou
hast
witnessed
have
sacrificed
their
life
their
substance
their
wives
their
children
their
all
and
ascended
unto
the
loftiest
chambers
of
paradise
is
it
fair
to
reject
the
testimony
of
these
detached
and
exalted
beings
to
the
truth
of
this
and
glorious
revelation
and
to
regard
as
acceptable
the
denunciations
which
have
been
uttered
against
this
resplendent
light
by
this
faithless
people
who
for
gold
have
forsaken
their
faith
and
who
for
the
sake
of
leadership
have
repudiated
him
who
is
the
first
leader
of
all
mankind
this
although
their
character
is
now
revealed
unto
all
people
who
have
recognized
them
as
those
who
will
in
no
wise
relinquish
one

or
one
tittle
of
their

sign
of
the
revelation
of
god
each
according
to
its
capacity
is
and
will
ever
remain
a
token
of
the
almighty
inasmuch
as
he
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
hath
willed
to
reveal
his
sovereignty
in
the
kingdom
of
names
and
attributes
each
and
every
created
thing
hath
through
the
act
of
the
divine
will
been
made
a
sign
of
his
glory
so
pervasive
and
general
is
this
revelation
that
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
whole
universe
can
be
discovered
that
doth
not
reflect
his
splendor
under
such
conditions
every
consideration
of
proximity
and
remoteness
is
obliterated
were
the
hand
of
divine
power
to
divest
of
this
high
endowment
all
created
things
the
entire
universe
would
become
desolate
and
void
behold
how
immeasurably
exalted
is
the
lord
your
god
above
all
created
things
witness
the
majesty
of
his
sovereignty
his
ascendancy
and
supreme
power
if
the
things
which
have
been
created
by
be
his
ordained
to
be
the
manifestations
of
his
names
and
attributes
stand
by
virtue
of
the
grace
with
which
they
have
been
endowed
exalted
beyond
all
proximity
and
remoteness
how
much
loftier
must
be
that
divine
essence
that
hath
called
them
into
being
meditate
on
what
the
poet
hath
written
wonder
not
if
my
be
closer
to
me
than
mine
own
self
wonder
at
this
that
i
despite
such
nearness
should
still
be
so
far
from
considering
what
god
hath
revealed
that
we
are
closer
to
man
than
his
the
poet
hath
in
allusion
to
this
verse
stated
that
though
the
revelation
of
my
hath
so
permeated
my
being
that
he
is
closer
to
me
than
my
yet
notwithstanding
my
certitude
of
its
reality
and
my
recognition
of
my
station
i
am
still
so
far
removed
from
him
by
this
he
meaneth
that
his
heart
which
is
the
seat
of
the
and
the
throne
wherein
abideth
the
splendor
of
his
revelation
is
forgetful
of
its
creator
hath
strayed
from
his
path
hath
shut
out
itself
from
his
glory
and
is
stained
with
the
defilement
of
earthly
desires
it
should
be
remembered
in
this
connection
that
the
one
true
god
is
in
himself
exalted
beyond
and
above
proximity
and
remoteness
his
reality
transcendeth
such
limitations
his
relationship
to
his
creatures
knoweth
no
degrees
that
some
are
near
and
others
are
far
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
manifestations
themselves
that
the
heart
is
the
throne
in
which
the
revelation
of
god
the
is
centered
is
attested
by
the
holy
utterances
which
we
have
formerly
revealed
among
them
is
this
saying
earth
and
heaven
can
not
contain
me
what
can
alone
contain
me
is
the
heart
of
him
that
believeth
in
me
and
is
faithful
to
my
how
often
hath
the
human
heart
which
is
the
recipient
of
the
light
of
god
and
the
seat
of
the
revelation
of
the
erred
from
him
who
is
the
source
of
that
light
and
the
well
spring
of
that
revelation
it
is
the
waywardness
of
the
heart
that
removeth
it
far
from
god
and
condemneth
it
to
remoteness
from
him
those
hearts
however
that
are
aware
of
his
presence
are
close
to
him
and
are
to
be
regarded
as
having
drawn
nigh
unto
his
throne
consider
moreover
how
frequently
doth
man
become
forgetful
of
his
own
self
whilst
god
remaineth
through
his
knowledge
aware
of
his
creature
and
continueth
to
shed
upon
him
the
manifest
radiance
of
his
glory
it
is
evident
therefore
that
in
such
circumstances
he
is
closer
to
him
than
his
own
self
he
will
indeed
so
remain
for
ever
for
whereas
the
one
true
god
knoweth
all
things
perceiveth
all
things
and
comprehendeth
all
things
mortal
man
is
prone
to
err
and
is
ignorant
of
the
mysteries
that
lie
enfolded
within
him
let
no
one
imagine
that
by
our
assertion
that
all
created
things
are
the
signs
of
the
revelation
of
god
is
meant
men
be
they
good
or
evil
pious
or
infidel
are
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
nor
doth
it
imply
that
the
divine
be
his
name
and
exalted
be
his
under
any
circumstances
comparable
unto
men
or
can
in
any
way
be
associated
with
his
creatures
such
an
error
hath
been
committed
by
certain
foolish
ones
who
after
having
ascended
into
the
heavens
of
their
idle
fancies
have
interpreted
divine
unity
to
mean
that
all
created
things
are
the
signs
of
god
and
that
consequently
there
is
no
distinction
whatsoever
between
them
some
have
even
outstripped
them
by
maintaining
that
these
signs
are
peers
and
partners
of
god
himself
gracious
god
he
verily
is
one
and
indivisible
one
in
his
essence
one
in
his
attributes
everything
besides
him
is
as
nothing
when
brought
face
to
face
with
the
resplendent
revelation
of
but
one
of
his
names
with
no
more
than
the
faintest
intimation
of
his
much
less
when
confronted
with
his
own
self
by
the
righteousness
of
my
name
the
the
pen
of
the
most
high
trembleth
with
a
great
trembling
and
is
sore
shaken
at
the
revelation
of
these
words
how
puny
and
insignificant
is
the
evanescent
drop
when
compared
with
the
waves
and
billows
of
god
s
limitless
and
everlasting
ocean
and
how
utterly
contemptible
must
every
contingent
and
perishable
thing
appear
when
brought
face
to
face
with
the
uncreated
the
unspeakable
glory
of
the
eternal
we
implore
pardon
of
god
the
for
them
that
entertain
such
beliefs
and
give
utterance
to
such
words
say
o
people
how
can
a
fleeting
fancy
compare
with
the
and
how
can
the
creator
be
likened
unto
his
creatures
who
are
but
as
the
script
of
his
pen
nay
his
script
excelleth
all
things
and
is
sanctified
from
and
immeasurably
exalted
above
all
creatures
furthermore
consider
the
signs
of
the
revelation
of
god
in
their
relation
one
to
another
can
the
sun
which
is
but
one
of
these
signs
be
regarded
as
equal
in
rank
to
darkness
the
one
true
god
beareth
me
witness
no
man
can
believe
it
unless
he
be
of
those
whose
hearts
are
straitened
and
whose
eyes
have
become
deluded
say
consider
your
own
selves
your
nails
and
eyes
are
both
parts
of
your
bodies
do
ye
regard
them
of
equal
rank
and
value
if
ye
say
yea
say
then
ye
have
indeed
charged
with
imposture
the
lord
my
god
the
inasmuch
as
ye
pare
the
one
and
cherish
the
other
as
dearly
as
your
own
life
to
transgress
the
limits
of
one
s
own
rank
and
station
is
in
no
wise
permissible
the
integrity
of
every
rank
and
station
must
needs
be
preserved
by
this
is
meant
that
every
created
thing
should
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
station
it
hath
been
ordained
to
occupy
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
when
the
light
of
my
name
the
hath
shed
its
radiance
upon
the
universe
each
and
every
created
thing
hath
according
to
a
fixed
decree
been
endowed
with
the
capacity
to
exercise
a
particular
influence
and
been
made
to
possess
a
distinct
virtue
consider
the
effect
of
poison
deadly
though
it
is
it
possesseth
the
power
of
exerting
under
certain
conditions
a
beneficial
influence
the
potency
infused
into
all
created
things
is
the
direct
consequence
of
the
revelation
of
this
most
blessed
name
glorified
be
he
who
is
the
creator
of
all
names
and
attributes
cast
into
the
fire
the
tree
that
hath
rot
and
dried
up
and
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
green
and
goodly
tree
and
partake
of
the
fruit
thereof
the
people
living
in
the
days
of
the
manifestations
of
god
have
for
the
most
part
uttered
such
unseemly
sayings
these
have
been
set
down
circumstantially
in
the
revealed
books
and
holy
scriptures
he
is
really
a
believer
in
the
unity
of
god
who
recognizeth
in
each
and
every
created
thing
the
sign
of
the
revelation
of
him
who
is
the
eternal
truth
and
not
he
who
maintaineth
that
the
creature
is
indistinguishable
from
the
creator
consider
for
instance
the
revelation
of
the
light
of
the
name
of
god
the
educator
behold
how
in
all
things
the
evidences
of
such
a
revelation
are
manifest
how
the
betterment
of
all
beings
dependeth
upon
it
this
education
is
of
two
kinds
the
one
is
universal
its
influence
pervadeth
all
things
and
sustaineth
them
it
is
for
this
reason

bear
witness

have
never
acknowledged
the

consider
how

they
have
erred

they
whose

are

towards
him
who
is
the
object
of
the
adoration
of
the

creation
must
needs
in
this
day
pass

be
sanctified
from
all
created
things
visible
and
invisible
if
they
arise
to

of
him
who
is
the
unconstrained
stir
them
and
must
spread
it
abroad
on

how

how

the

that
separateth
us
from

who
in

are
occupied
with

many

the

all

to
none
is
given
the
right
to

it
would
be
impossible
to
conceive
any
act
more
contemptible
than
soliciting
in
the
name
of
the
one
true
god
the
riches
which
men
possess
it
is
incumbent
upon
thee
and
upon
the
followers
of
him
who
is
the
eternal
truth
to
summon
all
men
to
whatsoever
shall
sanctify
them
from
all
attachment
to
the
things
of
the
earth
and
purge
them
from
its
defilements
that
the
sweet
smell
of
the
raiment
of
the
may
be
smelled
from
all
them
that
love
him
they
who
are
possessed
of
riches
however
must
have
the
utmost
regard
for
the
poor
for
great
is
the
honor
destined
by
god
for
those
poor
who
are
steadfast
in
patience
by
my
life
there
is
no
honor
except
what
god
may
please
to
bestow
that
can
compare
to
this
honor
great
is
the
blessedness
awaiting
the
poor
that
endure
patiently
and
conceal
their
sufferings
and
well
is
it
with
the
rich
who
bestow
their
riches
on
the
needy
and
prefer
them
before
themselves
please
god
the
poor
may
exert
themselves
and
strive
to
earn
the
means
of
livelihood
this
is
a
duty
which
in
this
most
great
revelation
hath
been
prescribed
unto
every
one
and
is
accounted
in
the
sight
of
god
as
a
goodly
deed
whoso
observeth
this
duty
the
help
of
the
invisible
one
shall
most
certainly
aid
him
he
can
enrich
through
his
grace
whomsoever
he
pleaseth
he
verily
hath
power
over
all
things
tell
o
alí
the
loved
ones
of
god
that
equity
is
the
most
fundamental
among
human
virtues
the
evaluation
of
all
things
must
needs
depend
upon
it
ponder
a
while
on
the
woes
and
afflictions
which
this
prisoner
hath
sustained
i
have
all
the
days
of
my
life
been
at
the
mercy
of
mine
enemies
and
have
suffered
each
day
in
the
path
of
the
love
of
god
a
fresh
tribulation
i
have
patiently
endured
until
the
fame
of
the
cause
of
god
was
spread
abroad
on
the
earth
if
any
one
should
now
arise
and
prompted
by
the
vain
imaginations

heart
hath
devised

openly
or
in
secret
to
sow
the
seeds

such

said
to
have
acted
with
equity
no
by
him
whose
might
extendeth
over
all
things
by
my
life
mine
heart
groaneth
and
mine
eyes
weep
sore
for
the
cause
of
god
and
for
them
that
understand
not
what
they
say
and
imagine
what
they
can
not
comprehend
it
beseemeth
all
men
in
this
day
to
take
firm
hold
on
the
most
great
name
and
to
establish
the
unity
of
all
mankind
there
is
no
place
to
flee
to
no
refuge
that
any
one
can
seek
except
him
should
any
man
be
led
to
utter
such
words
as
will
turn
away
the
people
from
the
shores
of
god
s
limitless
ocean
and
cause
them
to
fix
their
hearts
on
anything
except
this
glorious
and
manifest
being
that
hath
assumed
a
form
subject
to
human
a
man
however
lofty
the
station
he
may
occupy
shall
be
denounced
by
the
entire
creation

hath
deprived
himself

sweet
savors
of
the

in
your
judgment

men
of
understanding

he
that
is
unjust
in
his
judgment
is
destitute

characteristics
that

who
is
the
eternal
truth
knoweth
well
what
the
breasts
of
men

long
forbearance

emboldened
his
creatures

appointed
time

any

asunder
his
surpassing
mercy

restrained
the
fury
of
his
wrath
and
caused
most
people
to
imagine
that
the
one
true
god
is
unaware

have
privily
committed
by
him
who

thy

o
thou
that
forgivest
the
heedless
ones
that
trespass
against
thee
we
have
forbidden
men
to
walk
after
the
imaginations
of
their
hearts
that
they
may
be
enabled
to
recognize
him
who
is
the
sovereign

of
all
knowledge

may
acknowledge
whatsoever
he
may
be
pleased
to
reveal

how
they
have
entangled
themselves
with
their
idle
fancies
and
vain
imaginations
by
my
life
they
are
themselves
the
victims
of
what
their
own
hearts
have
devised
and
yet
they
perceive
it
not

and
profitless
is
the
talk
of
their
lips
and
yet
they
understand
not

beseech
god
that
he
may
graciously
vouchsafe
his
grace
unto
all
men
and
enable
them
to
attain
the
knowledge
of
him
and
of
themselves
by
my
life
whoso
hath
known
him
shall
soar
in
the
immensity
of
his
love
and
shall
be
detached
from
the
world

all
that
is
therein
nothing
on
earth
shall
deflect
him
from
his
course

much
less

who
prompted
by
their
vain
imaginations

things

god
hath
forbidden

god
cried
out
for
his
affliction
was
he
not
a
scion
of
your
prophet
s
ancient
house
had
not
his
fame
as
a
direct
descendant
of
the
apostle
been
spread
abroad
amongst
you
why
then
did
ye
inflict
upon
him
what
no
man
however
far
ye
may
look
back
hath
inflicted
upon
another
by
god
the
eye
of
creation
hath
never
beheld
your
like
ye
slay
him
who
is
a
scion
of
your
prophet
s
house
and
rejoice
and
make
merry
while
seated
on
your
seats
of
honor
ye
utter
your
imprecations
against
them
who
were
before
you
and
who
have
perpetrated
what
ye
have
perpetrated
and
remain
yourselves
all
the
time
unaware
of
your
enormities
be
fair
in
your
judgment
did
they
whom
you
curse
upon
whom
ye
invoke
evil
act
differently
from
yourselves
have
they
not
slain
the
descendant
of
their
prophet
as
ye
have
slain
the
descendant
of
your
own
is
not
your
conduct
similar
to
their
conduct
wherefore
then
claim
ye
to
be
different
from
them
o
ye
sowers
of
dissension
amongst
men
and
when
ye
took
away
his
life
one
of
his
followers
arose
to
avenge
his
death
he
was
unknown
of
men
and
the
design
he
had
conceived
was
unnoticed
by
any
one
eventually
he
committed
what
had
been
preordained
it
behoveth
you
therefore
to
attach
blame
to
no
one
except
to
yourselves
for
the
things
ye
have
committed
if
ye
but
judge
fairly
who
is
there
on
the
whole
earth
who
hath
done
what
ye
have
done
none
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
worlds
all
the
rulers
and
kings
of
the
earth
honor
and
revere
the
descendants
of
their
prophets
and
holy
men
could
ye
but
perceive
it
ye
on
the
other
hand
are
responsible
for
such
acts
as
no
man
hath
at
any
time
performed
your
misdeeds
have
caused
every
understanding
heart
to
be
consumed
with
grief
and
yet
ye
have
remained
sunk
in
your
heedlessness
and
failed
to
realize
the
wickedness
of
your
actions
ye
have
persisted
in
your
waywardness
until
ye
rose
up
against
us
though
we
had
committed
nothing
to
justify
your
enmity
fear
ye
not
god
who
hath
created
you
and
fashioned
you
and
caused
you
to
attain
your
strength
and
joined
you
with
them
that
have
resigned
themselves
to
him
muslims
how
long
will
ye
persist
in
your
waywardness
how
long
will
ye
refuse
to
reflect
how
long
ere
ye
shake
off
your
slumber
and
are
roused
from
your
heedlessness
how
long
will
ye
remain
unaware
of
the
truth
ponder
in
thine
heart
did
ye
notwithstanding
your
behavior
and
the
things
your
hands
have
wrought
succeed
in
quenching
the
fire
of
god
or
in
putting
out
the
light
of
his
light
that
hath
enveloped
with
its
brightness
them
that
are
immersed
in
the
billowing
oceans
of
immortality
and
hath
attracted
the
souls
of
such
as
truly
believe
in
and
uphold
his
unity
know
ye
not
that
the
hand
of
god
is
over
your
hands
that
his
irrevocable
decree
transcendeth
all
your
devices
that
he
is
supreme
over
his
servants
that
he
is
equal
to
his
purpose
that
he
doth
what
he
wisheth
that
he
shall
not
be
asked
of
whatever
he
willeth
that
he
ordaineth
what
he
pleaseth
that
he
is
the
most
powerful
the
almighty
if
ye
believe
this
to
be
the
truth
wherefore
then
will
ye
not
cease
from
troubling
and
be
at
peace
with
yourselves
ye
perpetrate
every
day
a
fresh
injustice
and
treat
me
as
ye
treated
me
in
times
past
though
i
never
attempted
to
meddle
with
your
affairs
at
no
time
have
i
opposed
you
neither
have
i
rebelled
against
your
laws
behold
how
ye
have
at
the
last
made
me
a
prisoner
in
this
land
know
for
a
certainty
however
that
whatever
your
hands
or
the
hands
of
the
infidels
have
wrought
will
never
as
they
never
did
of
old
change
the
cause
of
god
or
alter
his
ways
give
heed
to
my
warning
ye
people
of
persia
if
i
be
slain
at
your
hands
god
will
assuredly
raise
up
one
who
will
fill
the
seat
made
vacant
through
my
death
for
such
is
god
s
method
carried
into
effect
of
old
and
no
change
can
ye
find
in
god
s
method
of
dealing
seek
ye
to
put
out
god
s
light
that
shineth
upon
his
earth
averse
is
god
from
what
ye
desire
he
shall
perfect
his
light
albeit
ye
abhor
it
in
the
secret
of
your
hearts
pause
for
but
a
little
while
and
reflect
o
minister
and
be
fair
in
thy
judgment
what
is
it
that
we
have
committed
that
could
justify
thee
in
having
slandered
us
unto
the
king
s
ministers
in
following
thy
desires
in
perverting
the
truth
and
in
uttering
thy
calumnies
against
us
we
have
never
met
each
other
except
when
we
met
thee
in
thy
father
s
house
in
the
days
when
the
martyrdom
of
imám
ḥusayn
was
being
commemorated
on
those
occasions
no
one
could
have
the
chance
of
making
known
to
others
his
views
and
beliefs
in
conversation
or
in
discourse
thou
wilt
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
words
if
thou
be
of
the
truthful
i
have
frequented
no
other
gatherings
in
which
thou
couldst
have
learned
my
mind
or
in
which
any
other
could
have
done
so
how
then
didst
thou
pronounce
thy
verdict
against
me
when
thou
hadst
not
heard
my
testimony
from
mine
own
lips
hast
thou
not
heard
what
god
exalted
be
his
glory
hath
said
say
not
to
every
one
who
meeteth
you
with
a
greeting
thou
art
not
a
believer
thrust
not
away
those
who
cry
to
their
lord
at
morn
and
even
craving
to
behold
his
thou
hast
indeed
forsaken
what
the
book
of
god
hath
prescribed
and
yet
thou
deemest
thyself
to
be
a
believer
despite
what
thou
hast
done
i
to
this
god
is
my
against
thee
nor
against
any
one
though
from
thee
and
others
we
receive
such
hurt
as
no
believer
in
the
unity
of
god
can
sustain
my
cause
is
in
the
hand
of
none
except
god
and
my
trust
is
in
no
one
else
but
him
erelong
shall
your
days
pass
away
as
shall
pass
away
the
days
of
those
who
now
with
flagrant
pride
vaunt
themselves
over
their
neighbor
soon
shall
ye
be
gathered
together
in
the
presence
of
god
and
shall
be
asked
of
your
doings
and
shall
be
repaid
for
what
your
hands
have
wrought
and
wretched
the
abode
of
the
wicked
doers
by
god
wert
thou
to
realize
what
thou
hast
done
thou
wouldst
surely
weep
sore
over
thyself
and
wouldst
flee
for
refuge
to
god
and
wouldst
pine
away
and
mourn
all
the
days
of
thy
life
till
god
will
have
forgiven
thee
for
he
verily
is
the
most
generous
the
thou
wilt
however
persist
till
the
hour
of
thy
death
in
thy
heedlessness
inasmuch
as
thou
hast
with
all
thine
heart
thy
soul
and
inmost
being
busied
thyself
with
the
vanities
of
the
world
thou
shalt
after
thy
departure
discover
what
we
have
revealed
unto
thee
and
shalt
find
all
thy
doings
recorded
in
the
book
wherein
the
works
of
all
them
that
dwell
on
earth
be
they
greater
or
less
than
the
weight
of
an
atom
are
noted
down
heed
therefore
my
counsel
and
hearken
thou
with
the
hearing
of
thine
heart
unto
my
speech
and
be
not
careless
of
my
words
nor
be
of
them
that
reject
my
truth
glory
not
in
the
things
that
have
been
given
thee
set
before
thine
eyes
what
hath
been
revealed
in
the
book
of
god
the
help
in
peril
the
and
when
they
had
forgotten
their
warnings
we
set
open
to
them
the
gates
of
all
things
even
as
we
did
set
open
to
thee
and
to
thy
like
the
gates
of
this
earth
and
the
ornaments
thereof
wait
thou
therefore
for
what
hath
been
promised
in
the
latter
part
of
this
holy
verse
for
this
is
a
promise
from
him
who
is
the
almighty
the
promise
that
will
not
prove
untrue
i
know
not
the
path
ye
have
chosen
and
which
ye
tread
o
congregation
of
my
we
summon
you
to
god
we
remind
you
of
his
day
we
announce
unto
you
tidings
of
your
reunion
with
him
we
draw
you
nigh
unto
his
court
and
send
down
upon
you
tokens
of
his
wondrous
wisdom
and
yet
lo
behold
how
ye
reject
us
how
ye
condemn
us
through
the
things
which
your
lying
mouths
have
uttered
as
an
infidel
how
ye
devise
your
devices
against
us
and
when
we
manifest
unto
you
what
god
hath
through
his
bountiful
favor
bestowed
upon
us
ye
say
it
is
but
plain
the
same
words
were
spoken
by
the
generations
that
were
before
you
and
were
what
you
are
did
ye
but
perceive
it
ye
have
thereby
deprived
yourselves
of
the
bounty
of
god
and
of
his
grace
and
shall
never
obtain
them
till
the
day
when
god
will
have
judged
between
us
and
you
and
he
verily
is
the
best
of
judges
certain
ones
among
you
have
said
he
it
is
who
hath
laid
claim
to
be
by
god
this
is
a
gross
calumny
i
am
but
a
servant
of
god
who
hath
believed
in
him
and
in
his
signs
and
in
his
prophets
and
in
his
angels
my
tongue
and
my
heart
and
my
inner
and
my
outer
being
testify
that
there
is
no
god
but
him
that
all
others
have
been
created
by
his
behest
and
been
fashioned
through
the
operation
of
his
will
there
is
none
other
god
but
him
the
creator
the
raiser
from
the
dead
the
quickener
the
slayer
i
am
he
that
telleth
abroad
the
favors
with
which
god
hath
through
his
bounty
favored
me
if
this
be
my
transgression
then
i
am
truly
the
first
of
the
transgressors
i
and
my
kindred
are
at
your
mercy
do
ye
as
ye
please
and
be
not
of
them
that
hesitate
that
i
might
return
to
god
my
lord
and
reach
the
place
where
i
can
no
longer
behold
your
faces
this
indeed
is
my
dearest
wish
my
most
ardent
desire
of
my
state
god
is
verily
sufficiently
informed
observant
imagine
thyself
to
be
under
the
eye
of
god
o
minister
if
thou
seest
him
not
he
in
truth
clearly
seeth
thee
observe
and
judge
fairly
our
cause
what
is
it
that
we
have
committed
that
could
have
induced
thee
to
rise
up
against
us
and
to
slander
us
to
the
people
if
thou
be
of
them
who
are
just
we
departed
out
of
ṭihrán
at
the
bidding
of
the
king
and
by
his
leave
transferred
our
residence
to
iráq
if
i
had
transgressed
against
him
why
then
did
he
release
me
and
if
i
were
innocent
of
guilt
wherefore
did
ye
afflict
us
with
such
tribulation
as
none
among
them
that
profess
your
faith
hath
suffered
hath
any
of
mine
acts
after
mine
arrival
in
iráq
been
such
as
to
subvert
the
authority
of
the
government
who
is
it
that
can
be
said
to
have
detected
any
thing
reprehensible
in
our
behavior
enquire
for
thyself
of
its
people
that
thou
mayest
be
of
them
who
have
discerned
the
truth
for
eleven
years
we
dwelt
in
that
land
until
the
minister
representing
thy
government
arrived
whose
name
our
pen
is
loth
to
mention
who
was
given
to
wine
who
followed
his
lusts
and
committed
wickedness
and
was
corrupt
and
corrupted
iráq
to
this
will
bear
witness
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
wert
thou
to
inquire
of
them
and
be
of
such
as
seek
the
truth
he
it
was
who
wrongfully
seized
the
substance
of
his
who
forsook
all
the
commandments
of
god
and
perpetrated
whatever
god
had
forbidden
eventually
he
following
his
desires
rose
up
against
us
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
the
unjust
he
accused
us
in
his
letter
to
thee
and
thou
didst
believe
him
and
followed
in
his
way
without
seeking
any
proof
or
trustworthy
evidence
from
him
thou
didst
ask
for
no
explanation
nor
didst
thou
attempt
either
to
investigate
or
ascertain
the
matter
that
the
truth
might
be
distinguished
from
falsehood
in
thy
sight
and
that
thou
mightest
be
clear
in
thy
discernment
find
out
for
thyself
the
sort
of
man
he
was
by
asking
those
ministers
who
were
at
that
time
in
iráq
as
well
as
the
governor
of
the
city
and
its
high
counsellor
that
the
truth
may
be
revealed
to
thee
and
that
thou
mayest
be
of
the
god
is
our
witness
we
have
under
no
circumstances
opposed
either
him
or
others
we
observed
under
all
conditions
the
precepts
of
god
and
were
never
one
of
those
that
wrought
disorders
to
this
he
himself
doth
testify
his
intention
was
to
lay
hold
on
us
and
send
us
back
to
persia
that
he
might
thereby
exalt
his
fame
and
reputation
thou
hast
committed
the
same
crime
and
for
the
purpose
ye
both
are
of
equal
grade
in
the
sight
of
god
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
the
it
is
not
our
purpose
in
addressing
to
thee
these
words
to
lighten
the
burden
of
our
woe
or
to
induce
thee
to
intercede
for
us
with
any
one
no
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
worlds
we
have
set
forth
the
whole
matter
before
thee
that
perchance
thou
might
realize
what
thou
hast
done
might
desist
from
inflicting
on
others
the
hurt
thou
hast
inflicted
on
us
and
might
be
of
them
that
have
truly
repented
to
god
who
created
thee
and
created
all
things
and
might
act
with
discernment
in
the
future
better
is
this
for
thee
than
all
thou
dost
possess
than
thy
ministry
whose
days
are
numbered
beware
lest
thou
be
led
to
connive
at
injustice
set
thy
heart
firmly
upon
justice
and
alter
not
the
cause
of
god
and
be
of
them
whose
eyes
are
directed
towards
the
things
that
have
been
revealed
in
his
book
follow
not
under
any
condition
the
promptings
of
thine
evil
desires
keep
thou
the
law
of
god
thy
lord
the
beneficent
the
ancient
of
days
thou
shalt
most
certainly
return
to
dust
and
shalt
perish
like
all
the
things
in
which
thou
takest
delight
this
is
what
the
tongue
of
truth
and
glory
hath
spoken
rememberest
thou
not
god
s
warning
uttered
in
times
past
that
thou
mayest
be
of
them
that
heed
his
warning
he
said
and
he
verily
speaketh
the
truth
from
it
earth
have
we
created
you
and
unto
it
will
we
return
you
and
out
of
it
will
we
bring
you
forth
a
second
this
is
what
god
ordained
unto
all
them
that
dwell
on
earth
be
they
high
or
low
it
behoveth
not
therefore
him
who
was
created
from
dust
who
will
return
unto
it
and
will
again
be
brought
forth
out
of
it
to
swell
with
pride
before
god
and
before
his
loved
ones
to
proudly
scorn
them
and
be
filled
with
disdainful
arrogance
nay
rather
it
behoveth
thee
and
those
like
thee
to
submit
yourselves
to
them
who
are
the
manifestations
of
the
unity
of
god
and
to
defer
humbly
to
the
faithful
who
have
forsaken
their
all
for
the
sake
of
god
and
have
detached
themselves
from
the
things
which
engross
men
s
attention
and
lead
them
astray
from
the
path
of
god
the
the
thus
do
we
send
down
upon
you

shall

beware
o
king
that
thou
gather
not
around
thee
such
ministers
as
follow
the
desires
of
a
corrupt
inclination
as
have
cast
behind
their
backs
that
which
hath
been
committed
into
their
hands
and
manifestly
betrayed
their
trust
be
bounteous
to
others
as
god
hath
been
bounteous
to
thee
and
abandon
not
the
interests
of
thy
people
to
the
mercy
of
such
ministers
as
these
lay
not
aside
the
fear
of
god
and
be
thou
of
them
that
act
uprightly
gather
around
thee
those
ministers
from
whom
thou
canst
perceive
the
fragrance
of
faith
and
of
justice
and
take
thou
counsel
with
them
and
choose
whatever
is
best
in
thy
sight
and
be
of
them
that
act
generously
know
thou
for
a
certainty
that
whoso
disbelieveth
in
god
is
neither
trustworthy
nor
truthful
this
indeed
is
the
truth
the
undoubted
truth
he
that
acteth
treacherously
towards
god
will
also
act
treacherously
towards
his
king
nothing
whatever
can
deter
such
a
man
from
evil
nothing
can
hinder
him
from
betraying
his
neighbor
nothing
can
induce
him
to
walk
uprightly
take
heed
that
thou
resign
not
the
reins
of
the
affairs
of
thy
state
into
the
hands
of
others
and
repose
not
thy
confidence
in
ministers
unworthy
of
thy
trust
and
be
not
of
them
that
live
in
heedlessness
shun
them
whose
hearts
are
turned
away
from
thee
and
place
not
thy
confidence
in
them
and
entrust
them
not
with
thine
affairs
and
the
affairs
of
such
as
profess
thy
faith
beware
that
thou
allow
not
the
wolf
to
become
the
shepherd
of
god
s
flock
and
surrender
not
the
fate
of
his
loved
ones
to
the
mercy
of
the
malicious
expect
not
that
they
who
violate
the
ordinances
of
god
will
be
trustworthy
or
sincere
in
the
faith
they
profess
avoid
them
and
preserve
strict
guard
over
thyself
lest
their
devices
and
mischief
hurt
thee
turn
away
from
them
and
fix
thy
gaze
upon
god
thy
lord
the
the
most
bountiful
he
that
giveth
up
himself
wholly
to
god
god
shall
assuredly
be
with
him
and
he
that
placeth
his
complete
trust
in
god
god
shall
verily
protect
him
from
whatsoever
may
harm
him
and
shield
him
from
the
wickedness
of
every
evil
plotter
wert
thou
to
incline
thine
ear
unto
my
speech
and
observe
my
counsel
god
would
exalt
thee
to
so
eminent
a
position
that
the
designs
of
no
man
on
the
whole
earth
can
ever
touch
or
hurt
thee
observe
o
king
with
thine
inmost
heart
and
with
thy
whole
being
the
precepts
of
god
and
walk
not
in
the
paths
of
the
oppressor
seize
thou
and
hold
firmly
within
the
grasp
of
thy
might
the
reins
of
the
affairs
of
thy
people
and
examine
in
person
whatever
pertaineth
unto
them
let
nothing
escape
thee
for
therein
lieth
the
highest
good
render
thanks
unto
god
for
having
chosen
thee
out
of
the
whole
world
and
made
thee
king
over
them
that
profess
thy
faith
it
well
beseemeth
thee
to
appreciate
the
wondrous
favors
with
which
god
hath
favored
thee
and
to
magnify
continually
his
name
thou
canst
best
praise
him
if
thou
lovest
his
loved
ones
and
dost
safeguard
and
protect
his
servants
from
the
mischief
of
the
treacherous
that
none
may
any
longer
oppress
them
thou
shouldst
moreover
arise
to
enforce
the
law
of
god
amongst
them
that
thou
mayest
be
of
those
who
are
firmly
established
in
his
law
shouldst
thou
cause
rivers
of
justice
to
spread
their
waters
amongst
thy
subjects
god
would
surely
aid
thee
with
the
hosts
of
the
unseen
and
of
the
seen
and
would
strengthen
thee
in
thine
affairs
no
god
is
there
but
him
all
creation
and
its
empire
are
his
unto
him
return
the
works
of
the
faithful
place
not
thy
reliance
on
thy
treasures
put
thy
whole
confidence
in
the
grace
of
god
thy
lord
let
him
be
thy
trust
in
whatever
thou
doest
and
be
of
them
that
have
submitted
themselves
to
his
will
let
him
be
thy
helper
and
enrich
thyself
with
his
treasures
for
with
him
are
the
treasuries
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
he
bestoweth
them
upon
whom
he
will
and
from
whom
he
will
he
withholdeth
them
there
is
none
other
god
but
him
the
the
all
are
but
paupers
at
the
door
of
his
mercy
all
are
helpless
before
the
revelation
of
his
sovereignty
and
beseech
his
favors
overstep
not
the
bounds
of
moderation
and
deal
justly
with
them
that
serve
thee
bestow
upon
them
according
to
their
needs
and
not
to
the
extent
that
will
enable
them
to
lay
up
riches
for
themselves
to
deck
their
persons
to
embellish
their
homes
to
acquire
the
things
that
are
of
no
benefit
unto
them
and
to
be
numbered
with
the
extravagant
deal
with
them
with
undeviating
justice
so
that
none
among
them
may
either
suffer
want
or
be
pampered
with
luxuries
this
is
but
manifest
justice
allow
not
the
abject
to
rule
over
and
dominate
them
who
are
noble
and
worthy
of
honor
and
suffer
not
the
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
contemptible
and
worthless
for
this
is
what
we
observed
upon
our
arrival
in
the
city
constantinople
and
to
it
we
bear
witness
we
found
among
its
inhabitants
some
who
were
possessed
of
an
affluent
fortune
and
lived
in
the
midst
of
excessive
riches
while
others
were
in
dire
want
and
abject
poverty
this
ill
beseemeth
thy
sovereignty
and
is
unworthy
of
thy
rank
let
my
counsel
be
acceptable
to
thee
and
strive
thou
to
rule
with
equity
among
men
that
god
may
exalt
thy
name
and
spread
abroad
the
fame
of
thy
justice
in
all
the
world
beware
lest
thou
aggrandize
thy
ministers
at
the
expense
of
thy
subjects
fear
the
sighs
of
the
poor
and
of
the
upright
in
heart
who
at
every
break
of
day
bewail
their
plight
and
be
unto
them
a
benignant
sovereign
they
verily
are
thy
treasures
on
earth
it
behoveth
thee
therefore
to
safeguard
thy
treasures
from
the
assaults
of
them
who
wish
to
rob
thee
inquire
into
their
affairs
and
ascertain
every
year
nay
every
month
their
condition
and
be
not
of
them
that
are
careless
of
their
duty
set
before
thine
eyes
god
s
unerring
balance
and
as
one
standing
in
his
presence
weigh
in
that
balance
thine
actions
every
day
every
moment
of
thy
life
bring
thyself
to
account
ere
thou
art
summoned
to
a
reckoning
on
the
day
when
no
man
shall
have
strength
to
stand
for
fear
of
god
the
day
when
the
hearts
of
the
heedless
ones
shall
be
made
to
tremble
it
behoveth
every
king
to
be
as
bountiful
as
the
sun
which
fostereth
the
growth
of
all
beings
and
giveth
to
each
its
due
whose
benefits
are
not
inherent
in
itself
but
are
ordained
by
him
who
is
the
most
powerful
the
almighty
the
king
should
be
as
generous
as
liberal
in
his
mercy
as
the
clouds
the
outpourings
of
whose
bounty
are
showered
upon
every
land
by
the
behest
of
him
who
is
the
supreme
ordainer
the
have
a
care
not
to
entrust
thine
affairs
of
state
entirely
into
another
s
hands
none
can
discharge
thy
functions
better
than
thine
own
self
thus
do
we
make
clear
unto
thee
our
words
of
wisdom
and
send
down
upon
thee
that
which
can
enable
thee
to
pass
over
from
the
left
hand
of
oppression
to
the
right
hand
of
justice
and
approach
the
resplendent
ocean
of
his
favors
such
is
the
path
which
the
kings
that
were
before
thee
have
trodden
they
that
acted
equitably
towards
their
subjects
and
walked
in
the
ways
of
undeviating
justice
thou
art
god
s
shadow
on
earth
strive
therefore
to
act
in
such
a
manner
as
befitteth
so
eminent
so
august
a
station
if
thou
dost
depart
from
following
the
things
we
have
caused
to
descend
upon
thee
and
taught
thee
thou
wilt
assuredly
be
derogating
from
that
great
and
priceless
honor
return
then
and
cleave
wholly
unto
god
and
cleanse
thine
heart
from
the
world
and
all
its
vanities
and
suffer
not
the
love
of
any
stranger
to
enter
and
dwell
therein
not
until
thou
dost
purify
thine
heart
from
every
trace
of
such
love
can
the
brightness
of
the
light
of
god
shed
its
radiance
upon
it
for
to
none
hath
god
given
more
than
one
heart
this
verily
hath
been
decreed
and
written
down
in
his
ancient
book
and
as
the
human
heart
as
fashioned
by
god
is
one
and
undivided
it
behoveth
thee
to
take
heed
that
its
affections
be
also
one
and
undivided
cleave
thou
therefore
with
the
whole
affection
of
thine
heart
unto
his
love
and
withdraw
it
from
the
love
of
any
one
besides
him
that
he
may
aid
thee
to
immerse
thyself
in
the
ocean
of
his
unity
and
enable
thee
to
become
a
true
upholder
of
his
oneness
god
is
my
witness
my
sole
purpose
in
revealing
to
thee
these
words
is
to
sanctify
thee
from
the
transitory
things
of
the
earth
and
aid
thee
to
enter
the
realm
of
everlasting
glory
that
thou
mayest
by
the
leave
of
god
be
of
them
that
abide
and
rule
therein
i
swear
by
god
o
king
it
is
not
my
wish
to
make
my
plaint
to
thee
against
them
that
persecute
me
i
only
plead
my
grief
and
my
sorrow
to
god
who
hath
created
me
and
them
who
well
knoweth
our
state
and
who
watcheth
over
all
things
my
wish
is
to
warn
them
of
the
consequences
of
their
actions
if
perchance
they
might
desist
from
treating
others
as
they
have
treated
me
and
be
of
them
that
heed
my
warning
the
tribulations
that
have
touched
us
the
destitution
from
which
we
suffer
the
various
troubles
with
which
we
are
encompassed
shall
all
pass
away
as
shall
pass
away
the
pleasures
in
which
they
delight
and
the
affluence
they
enjoy
this
is
the
truth
which
no
man
on
earth
can
reject
the
days
in
which
we
have
been
compelled
to
dwell
in
the
dust
will
soon
be
ended
as
will
the
days
in
which
they
occupied
the
seats
of
honor
god
shall
assuredly
judge
with
truth
between
us
and
them
and
he
verily
is
the
best
of
judges
we
render
thanks
unto
god
for
whatsoever
hath
befallen
us
and
we
patiently
endure
the
things
he
hath
ordained
in
the
past
or
will
ordain
in
the
future
in
him
have
i
placed
my
trust
and
into
his
hands
have
i
committed
my
cause
he
will
certainly
repay
all
them
that
endure
with
patience
and
put
their
confidence
in
him
his
is
the
creation
and
its
empire
he
exalteth
whom
he
will
and
whom
he
will
he
doth
abase
he
shall
not
be
asked
of
his
doings
he
verily
is
the
the
almighty
let
thine
ear
be
attentive
o
king
to
the
words
we
have
addressed
to
thee
let
the
oppressor
desist
from
his
tyranny
and
cut
off
the
perpetrators
of
injustice
from
among
them
that
profess
thy
faith
by
the
righteousness
of
god
the
tribulations
we
have
sustained
are
such
that
any
pen
that
recounteth
them
can
not
but
be
overwhelmed
with
anguish
no
one
of
them
that
truly
believe
and
uphold
the
unity
of
god
can
bear
the
burden
of
their
recital
so
great
have
been
our
sufferings
that
even
the
eyes
of
our
enemies
have
wept
over
us
and
beyond
them
those
of
every
discerning
person
and
to
all
these
trials
have
we
been
subjected
in
spite
of
our
action
in
approaching
thee
and
in
bidding
the
people
to
enter
beneath
thy
shadow
that
thou
mightest
be
a
stronghold
unto
them
that
believe
in
and
uphold
the
unity
of
god
have
i
o
king
ever
disobeyed
thee
have
i
at
any
time
transgressed
any
of
thy
laws
can
any
of
thy
ministers
that
represented
thee
in
iráq
produce
any
proof
that
can
establish
my
disloyalty
to
thee
no
by
him
who
is
the
lord
of
all
worlds
not
for
one
short
moment
did
we
rebel
against
thee
or
against
any
of
thy
ministers
never
god
willing
shall
we
revolt
against
thee
though
we
be
exposed
to
trials
more
severe
than
any
we
suffered
in
the
past
in
the
day
time
and
in
the
night
season
at
even
and
at
morn
we
pray
to
god
on
thy
behalf
that
he
may
graciously
aid
thee
to
be
obedient
unto
him
and
to
observe
his
commandment
that
he
may
shield
thee
from
the
hosts
of
the
evil
ones
do
therefore
as
it
pleaseth
thee
and
treat
us
as
befitteth
thy
station
and
beseemeth
thy
sovereignty
be
not
forgetful
of
the
law
of
god
in
whatever
thou
desirest
to
achieve
now
or
in
the
days
to
come

praise

to

the
lord
of
all

of
revelation
o
hath
in
the
pen
of
revelation
o
hath
in
most
of
the
tablets
recorded
these
words
we
have
admonished
all
the
loved
ones
of
god
to
take
heed
lest
the
hem
of
our
sacred
vesture
be
smirched
with
the
mire
of
unlawful
deeds
or
be
stained
with
the
dust
of
reprehensible
conduct
we
have
moreover
exhorted
them
to
fix
their
gaze
upon
whatsoever
hath
been
revealed
in
our
tablets
had
their
inner
ears
been
attentive
to
the
divine
counsels
which
have
shone
forth
from
the
day
spring
of
the
pen
of
the

hearkened
unto
his
voice
most
of
the
peoples
of
the
earth
would
have
by
now
been
adorned
with
the
ornament
of
his
guidance
what
had
been
however
hath
come
to
pass
once
again
doth
the
tongue
of
the
ancient
of
days
reveal
while
in
this
most
great
prison
these
words
which
are
recorded
in
this
scroll
o
ye
the
beloved
of
the
one
true
god
pass
beyond
the
narrow
retreats
of
your
evil
and
corrupt
desires
and
advance
into
the
vast
immensity
of
the
realm
of
god
and
abide
ye
in
the
meads
of
sanctity
and
of
detachment
that
the
fragrance
of
your
deeds
may
lead
the
whole
of
mankind
to
the
ocean
of
god

unfading
glory

affairs
of
this
world
and
all
that
pertaineth
unto
it
or
from
meddling
with
the
activities
of
those
who
are

leaders
the

bestowed

be
enabled
to
unlock
through
the
power
of
the
most
great
name
the
gates
of
these
cities
this
is
what
is
meant
by
aiding
the
one
true
theme
to
which
the
pen
of
him
who
causeth
the
dawn
to
break
hath
referred
in
all
his
books
and
tablets
it
behoveth
likewise
the

ones
of

to
be
forbearing
towards
their
and
to
be
so
sanctified
and
detached
from
all
things
and
to
evince
such
sincerity
and
fairness
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
may
recognize
them
as
the

to
what
lofty
heights
the
injunctions
of
the
almighty
have
soared
and
how
abject
is
the
habitation
wherein
these
feeble
souls
are
now
abiding
blessed

they
who
on
the
wings
of
certitude
have
flown
in

hath
spread

o
the
works
which
god
the
sovereign
truth
hath
wrought
say
thou
how
great
how
very
great
is
the
power
of
his
might
that
encompasseth
all
worlds
exalted
immeasurably
exalted
is
his
detachment
above
the
reach
and

of
the
entire
creation

glorified

his
meekness
that
hath
melted
the
hearts
of

afflicted
with
countless
tribulations
which
we
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
our
enemies
we
have
proclaimed
unto
all
the
rulers
of
the
earth
what
god
hath
willed
to
proclaim
that
all
nations
may
know
that
no
manner
of
affliction
can
deter
the
pen
of
the
ancient
of
days
from
achieving
its
purpose
his
pen
moveth
by
the
leave
of
god
who
fashioneth
the
crumbling
and
rotten
bones
considering
this
most
mighty
enterprise
it
beseemeth
them
that
love
him
to
gird
up
the
loins
of
their
endeavor
and
to
fix
their
thoughts
on
whatever
will
ensure
the
victory
of
the
cause
of
god
rather
than
commit
vile
and
contemptible
deeds
wert
thou
to
consider
for
but
a
little
while
the
outward
works
and
doings
of
him
who
is
the
eternal
truth
thou
wouldst
fall
down
upon
the
ground
and
exclaim
o
thou
who
art
the
lord
of
lords
i
testify
that
thou
art
the
lord
of
all
creation
and
the
educator
of
all
beings
visible
and
invisible
i
bear
witness
that
thy
power
hath
encompassed
the
entire
universe
and
that
the
hosts
of
the
earth
can
never
dismay
thee
nor
can
the
dominion
of
all
peoples
and
nations
deter
thee
from
executing
thy
purpose
i
confess
that
thou
hast
no
desire
except
the
regeneration
of
the
whole
world
and
the
establishment
of
the
unity
of
its
peoples
and
the
salvation
of
all
them
that
dwell
therein

a
while
and
consider
how
they
who
are
the
loved
ones
of
god
must
conduct
themselves
and
to
what
heights
they
must
soar
beseech
thou
at
all
times
thy
lord
the
god
of
mercy
to
aid
them
to
do
what
he
willeth
he
verily
is
the
most
powerful
the
the
the
imprisonment
inflicted
on
this
wronged
one
o
did
to
him
no
harm
nor
can
it
ever
do
so
nor
can
the
loss
of
all
his
earthly
goods
his
exile
or
even
his
martyrdom
and
outward
humiliation
do
him
any
hurt
that
which
can
hurt
him
are
the
evil
deeds
which
the
beloved
of
god
commit
and
which
they
impute
to
him
who
is
the
sovereign
truth
this
is
the
affliction
from
which
i
suffer
and
to
this
he
himself
who
is
potent
over
all
things
beareth
me
witness
that
which
hath
sorely
hurt
me
are
the
claims
which
the
people
of
the
bayán
are
advancing
every
day
some
have
proclaimed
their
allegiance
to
one
of
my
branches
sons
while
others
have
asserted
independently
their
claims
and
acted
after
their
own
desires
o
the
tongue
of
grandeur
saith
by
myself
that
speaketh
the
truth
in
this
most
mighty
revelation
all
the
dispensations
of
the
past
have
attained
their
highest
and
final
consummation
whoso
layeth
claim
to
a
revelation
after
him
such
a
man
is
assuredly
a
lying
impostor
we
pray
god
that
he
may
graciously
assist
him
to
retract
and
repudiate
such
claim
should
he
repent
god
will
no
doubt
forgive
him
if
however
he
persisteth
in
his
error
god
will
assuredly
send
down
one
who
will
deal
mercilessly
with
him
he
verily
is
the
almighty
the
most

how
the
people
of
the

have
utterly
failed
to

that
the
sole

of

my

wherefore
have
ye
clouded

by

o

o

take
ye

together
and
let
your

be
only
for
that
which
profiteth
mankind
and
bettereth
the
condition
thereof
if
ye
be
of

that
scan
heedfully
regard
the
world
as
the
human
body
which
though
at
its
creation
whole
and
perfect
hath
been
afflicted
through
various
causes
with
grave
disorders
and
maladies
not
for
one
day
did
it
gain
ease
nay
its
sickness
waxed
more
severe
as
it
fell
under
the
treatment
of
ignorant
physicians
who
gave
full
rein
to
their
personal
desires
and
have
erred
grievously
and
if
at
one
time
through
the
care
of
an
able
physician
a
member
of
that
body
was
healed
the

remained
afflicted

you
the
the
we
behold
it
in

day
at
the
mercy
of
rulers
so
drunk
with
pride
that
they
can
not
discern
clearly
their
own
best
advantage
much
less
recognize
a
revelation
so
bewildering
and
challenging
as
this
and
whenever
any
one
of
them
hath
striven
to
improve
its
condition
his
motive
hath
been
his
own
gain
whether
confessedly
so
or
not
and
the
unworthiness
of
this
motive
hath
limited
his
power
to
heal
or
cure
that
which
the
lord
hath
ordained
as
the
sovereign
remedy
and
mightiest
instrument
for
the
healing
of
all
the
world
is
the
union
of
all
its
peoples
in
one
universal
cause
one
common
faith
this
can
in
no
wise
be
achieved
except
through
the
power
of
a
skilled
an
and

physician
this

how

have
shut
out

if
ye

all
the

will
laugh
you

you

you
that
have
produced

the

the

no

was
his

revelation
clothed
with
the

sent
down
unto

ye
cast
it
behind

all
that

walk
ye
in

ye
can
discover

me

whereunto
the
tongue

ancient
of

how
wondrous

the
unity

how

is
the
unity
of

the
unity
which
is
exalted
above
all
limitations
that
transcendeth
the
comprehension
of
all

he
hath
from

dwelt
in
his
inaccessible
habitation
of
holiness
and
glory
and
will
unto
everlasting
continue
to
be
enthroned
upon
the
heights
of
his
independent
sovereignty
and
grandeur
how
lofty
hath
been
his
incorruptible
essence
how
completely
independent
of
the
knowledge
of
all
created
things
and
how
immensely
exalted
will
it
remain
above
the
praise
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the

and
the
earth
from
the
exalted
source
and
out

the

may
be
deprived
of
its

in
expressing

according

effort
exerted
for
the
refinement
of

noble
mirror

it
be
made
to
reflect
the
glory

of
god

every

thing
will
be
enabled
so
great
is
this
reflecting
power
to
reveal
the
potentialities
of
its
station

recognize
its
capacity

will
testify
to
the
truth
that
he
verily
is
god
there
is
none
other
god

there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
in

of
the
efforts
which
every
man
may
consciously
exert
and
as
a
result
of
the
exertion
of
his
own
spiritual
faculties
this
mirror
can
be
so
cleansed
from
the
dross
of
earthly
defilements
and
purged
from
satanic
fancies
as
to
be
able
to
draw
nigh
unto
the
meads
of
eternal
holiness
and
attain
the
courts
of
everlasting
fellowship
in
pursuance
however
of
the
principle
that
for
every
thing
a
time
hath
been
fixed
and
for
every
fruit
a
season
hath
been
ordained
the
latent
energies
of
such
a
bounty
can
best
be
released
and
the
vernal
glory
of
such
a
gift
can
only
be
manifested
in
the
days
of
god
invested
though
each
day
may
be
with
its
share
of
god
s
wondrous
grace
the
days
immediately
associated
with
the
manifestation
of
god
possess
a
unique
distinction
and
occupy
a
station
which
no
mind
can
ever
comprehend
such
is
the
virtue
infused
into
them
that
if
the
hearts
of
all
that
dwell
in
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
in
those
days
of
everlasting
delight
to
be
brought
face
to
face
with
that
day
star
of
unfading
glory
and
attuned
to
his
will
each
would
find
itself
exalted
above
all
earthly
things
radiant
with
his
light
and
sanctified
through
his
grace
all
hail
to
this
grace
which
no
blessing
however
great
can
excel
and
all
honor
to
such
a
the
like
of
which
the
eye
of
creation
hath
not
seen
exalted
is
he
above
that
which
they
attribute
unto
him
or
recount
about
him
it
is
for
this
reason
that
in
those
days
no
man
shall
ever
stand
in
need
of
his
neighbor
it
hath
already
been
abundantly
demonstrated
that
in
that
day
the
majority
of
them
that
have
sought
and
attained
his
holy
court
have
revealed
such
knowledge
and
wisdom
a
drop
of
which
none
else
besides
these
holy
and
sanctified
souls
however
long
he
may
have
taught
or
studied
hath
grasped
or
will
ever
comprehend
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
power
that
the
beloved
of
god
have
in
the
days
of
the
manifestation
of
the
day
star
of
truth
been
exalted
above
and
made
independent

o
my
brother
when
a
true
seeker
determineth
to
take
the
step
of
search
in
the
path
leading
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
ancient
of
days
he
must
before
all
else
cleanse
his
heart
which
is
the
seat
of
the
revelation
of
the
inner
mysteries
of
god
from
the
obscuring
dust
of
all
acquired
knowledge
and
the
allusions
of
the
embodiments
of
satanic
fancy
he
must
purge
his
breast
which
is
the
sanctuary
of
the
abiding
love
of
the
beloved
of
every
defilement
and
sanctify
his
soul
from
all
that
pertaineth
to
water
and
clay
from
all
shadowy
and
ephemeral
attachments
he
must
so
cleanse
his
heart
that
no
remnant
of
either
love
or
hate
may
linger
therein
lest
that
love
blindly
incline
him
to
error
or
that
hate
repel
him
away
from
the
truth
even
as
thou
dost
witness
in
this
day
how
most
of
the
people
because
of
such
love
and
hate
are
bereft
of
the
immortal
face
have
strayed
far
from
the
embodiments
of
the
divine
mysteries
and
shepherdless
are
roaming
through
the
wilderness
of
oblivion
and
error
that
seeker
must
at
all
times
put
his
trust
in
god
must
renounce
the
peoples
of
the
earth
must
detach
himself
from
the
world
of
dust
and
cleave
unto
him
who
is
the
lord
of
lords
he
must
never
seek
to
exalt
himself
above
any
one
must
wash
away
from
the
tablet
of
his
heart
every
trace
of
pride
and
must
cling
unto
patience
and
resignation
observe
silence
and
refrain
from
idle
talk
for
the
tongue
is
a
smoldering
fire
and
excess
of
speech
a
deadly
poison
material
fire
consumeth
the
body
whereas
the
fire
of
the
tongue
devoureth
both
heart
and
soul
the
force
of
the
former
lasteth
but
for
a
time
whilst
the
effects
of
the
latter
endureth
a
century
that
seeker
should
also
regard
backbiting
as
grievous
error
and
keep
himself
aloof
from
its
dominion
inasmuch
as
backbiting
quencheth
the
light
of
the
heart
and
extinguisheth
the
life
of
the
soul
he
should
be
content
with
little
and
be
freed
from
all
inordinate
desire
he
should
treasure
the
companionship
of
them
that
have
renounced
the
world
and
regard
avoidance
of
boastful
and
worldly
people
a
precious
benefit
at
the
dawn
of
every
day
he
should
commune
with
god
and
with
all
his
soul
persevere
in
the
quest
of
his
beloved
he
should
consume
every
wayward
thought
with
the
flame
of
his
loving
mention
and
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
pass
by
all
else
save
him
he
should
succor
the
dispossessed
and
never
withhold
his
favor
from
the
destitute
he
should
show
kindness
to
animals
how
much
more
unto
his
to
him
who
is
endowed
with
the
power
of
utterance
he
should
not
hesitate
to
offer
up
his
life
for
his
beloved
nor
allow
the
censure
of
the
people
to
turn
him
away
from
the
truth
he
should
not
wish
for
others
that
which
he
doth
not
wish
for
himself
nor
promise
that
which
he
doth
not
fulfil
with
all
his
heart
he
should
avoid
fellowship
with
and
pray
for
the
remission
of
their
sins
he
should
forgive
the
sinful
and
never
despise
his
low
estate
for
none
knoweth
what
his
own
end
shall
be
how
often
hath
a
sinner
attained
at
the
hour
of
death
to
the
essence
of
faith
and
quaffing
the
immortal
draught
hath
taken
his
flight
unto
the
concourse
on
high
and
how
often
hath
a
devout
believer
at
the
hour
of
his
soul
s
ascension
been
so
changed
as
to
fall
into
the
nethermost
fire
our
purpose
in
revealing
these
convincing
and
weighty
utterances
is
to
impress
upon
the
seeker
that
he
should
regard
all
else
beside
god
as
transient
and
count
all
things
save
him
who
is
the
object
of
all
adoration
as
utter
nothingness
these
are
among
the
attributes
of
the
exalted
and
constitute
the
of
the
they
have
already
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
requirements
of
the
wayfarers
that
tread
the
path
of
positive
knowledge
when
the
detached
wayfarer
and
sincere
seeker
hath
fulfilled
these
essential
conditions
then
and
only
then
can
he
be
called
a
true
seeker
whensoever
he
hath
fulfilled
the
conditions
implied
in
the
verse
whoso
maketh
efforts
for
us
he
shall
enjoy
the
blessings
conferred
by
the
words
in
our
ways
shall
we
assuredly
guide
only
when
the
lamp
of
search
of
earnest
striving
of
longing
desire
of
passionate
devotion
of
fervid
love
of
rapture
and
ecstasy
is
kindled
within
the
seeker
s
heart
and
the
breeze
of
his
is
wafted
upon
his
soul
will
the
darkness
of
error
be
dispelled
the
mists
of
doubts
and
misgivings
be
dissipated
and
the
lights
of
knowledge
and
certitude
envelop
his
being
at
that
hour
will
the
mystic
herald
bearing
the
joyful
tidings
of
the
spirit
shine
forth
from
the
city
of
god
resplendent
as
the
morn
and
through
the
of
knowledge
will
awaken
the
heart
the
soul
and
the
spirit
from
the
slumber
of
heedlessness
then
will
the
manifold
favors
and
outpouring
grace
of
the
holy
and
everlasting
spirit
confer
such
new
life
upon
the
seeker
that
he
will
find
himself
endowed
with
a
new
eye
a
new
ear
a
new
heart
and
a
new
mind
he
will
contemplate
the
manifest
signs
of
the
universe
and
will
penetrate
the
hidden
mysteries
of
the
soul
gazing
with
the
eye
of
god
he
will
perceive
within
every
atom
a
door
that
leadeth
him
to
the
stations
of
absolute
certitude
he
will
discover
in
all
things
the
mysteries
of
divine
revelation
and
the
evidences
of
an
everlasting
manifestation
i
swear
by
god
were
he
that
treadeth
the
path
of
guidance
and
seeketh
to
scale
the
heights
of
righteousness
to
attain
unto
this
glorious
and
exalted
station
he
would
inhale
at
a
distance
of
a
thousand
leagues
the
fragrance
of
god
and
would
perceive
the
resplendent
morn
of
a
divine
guidance
rising
above
the
day
spring
of
all
things
each
and
every
thing
however
small
would
be
to
him
a
revelation
leading
him
to
his
beloved
the
object
of
his
quest
so
great
shall
be
the
discernment
of
this
seeker
that
he
will
discriminate
between
truth
and
falsehood
even
as
he
doth
distinguish
the
sun
from
shadow
if
in
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
east
the
sweet
savors
of
god
be
wafted
he
will
assuredly
recognize
and
inhale
their
fragrance
even
though
he
be
dwelling
in
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
west
he
will
likewise
clearly
distinguish
all
the
signs
of
wondrous
utterances
his
great
works
and
mighty
the
doings
the
words
and
ways
of
men
even
as
the
jeweler
who
knoweth
the
gem
from
the
stone
or
the
man
who
distinguisheth
the
spring
from
autumn
and
heat
from
cold
when
the
channel
of
the
human
soul
is
cleansed
of
all
worldly
and
impeding
attachments
it
will
unfailingly
perceive
the
breath
of
the
beloved
across
immeasurable
distances
and
will
led
by
its
perfume
attain
and
enter
the
city
of
certitude
therein
he
will
discern
the
wonders
of
his
ancient
wisdom
and
will
perceive
all
the
hidden
teachings
from
the
rustling
leaves
of
the
tree
that
flourisheth
in
that
city
with
both
his
inner
and
outer
ear
he
will
hear
from
its
dust
the
hymns
of
glory
and
praise
ascending
unto
the
lord
of
lords
and
with
his
inner
eye
will
he
discover
the
mysteries
of
return
and
how
unspeakably
glorious
are
the
signs
the
tokens
the
revelations
and
splendors
which
he
who
is
the
king
of
names
and
attributes
hath
destined
for
that
city
the
attainment
unto
this
city
quencheth
thirst
without
water
and
kindleth
the
love
of
god
without
fire
within
every
blade
of
grass
are
enshrined
the
mysteries
of
an
inscrutable
wisdom
and
upon
every
a
myriad
nightingales

out
in
blissful
rapture

melody
its
wondrous
tulips
unfold
the
mystery
of
the
undying
fire
in
the
burning
bush
and
its
sweet
savors
of
holiness
breathe
the
perfume
of
the
messianic
spirit
it
bestoweth
wealth
without
gold
and
conferreth
immortality
without
death
in
each
one
of
its
leaves
ineffable
delights
are
treasured
and
within
every
chamber
unnumbered
mysteries
lie
hidden
they
that
valiantly
labor
in
quest
of
god
will
when
once
they
have
renounced
all
else
but
him
be
so
attached
and
wedded
unto
that
city
that
a
moment
s
separation
from
it
would
to
them
be
unthinkable
they
will
hearken
unto
infallible
proofs
from
the
hyacinth
of
that
assembly
and
will
receive
the
surest
testimonies
from
the
beauty
of
its
rose
and
the
melody
of
its
nightingale
once
in
about
a
thousand
years
shall
this
city
be
renewed
and
readorned

none
other
than
the
word

enemies
have
compassed
me
about

of
men
feared
and
trembled
the
days
when
they
hid
themselves
from
the
eyes
of
the
loved
ones
of
god
and
of
his
enemies
and
were
busied
in
ensuring
their
own
security
and
peace
we
eventually
succeeded
in
manifesting
the
cause
of
god
and
exalted
it
to
so
eminent
a
position
that
all
the
people
except
those
who
cherished
in
their
hearts
against
this
youth
and
joined
partners
with

acknowledged
the

of

his
mighty
dominion

yet
notwithstanding
this

whose

hath
pervaded
all

despite
the
brightness
of
this
light
the
like
of
which
none
of

hath
ever
beheld
witness
how
the
people
of
the
bayán
have
denied
and
contended
with
me
some
have
turned
away
from
the
path
of
god
rejected
the
authority
of
him
in
whom
they
had
believed
and
acted
insolently
towards
god
the
most
powerful
the
supreme
protector
the
most
exalted
the
most
great
others
hesitated
and
halted
in
his
path
and
regarded
the
cause
of
the
creator
in
its
inmost
truth
as
invalid
unless
substantiated
by
the
approval
of
him
who
was
created
through
the
operation
of
my
will
thus
have
their
works
come
to
naught
and
yet
they
failed
to
perceive
it
among
them
is
he
who
sought
to
measure
god
with
the
measure
of
his
own
self
and
was
so
misled
by
the
names
of
god
as
to
rise
up
against
me
who
condemned
me
as
one
that
deserved
to
be
put
to
death
and
who
imputed
to
me
the
very
offenses
of
which
he
himself
was
guilty
wherefore
do
i
plead
my
grief
and
my
sorrow
to
him
who
created
me
and
entrusted
me
with
his
message
unto
him
do
i
render
thanks
and
praise
for
the
things
he
hath
ordained
for
my
loneliness
and
the
anguish
i
suffer
at
the
hands
of
these
men
who
have
strayed
so
far
from
him
i
have
patiently
sustained
and
will
continue
to
sustain

of
our
power
hath
overshadowed
all
that

and
all
that
are
on
the
earth
we
have
through
the
power
of
truth
the
very
truth
manifested
an
infinitesimal
glimmer
of
our
impenetrable
mystery

increasingly
in

with
the
incorruptible
vestures
of
thy
god

its
power
into

from
any

the
smell
of

no

of

would
deign

it
much
less
to

we
have
formerly
referred
to
this
subject
in
passages
revealed
in
the
arabic
tongue
in
a
language
of
exquisite
beauty
god
is
our
witness
whoever
hath
tasted
the
sweetness
of
those
words
will
never
consent
to
transgress
the
bounds
which
god
hath
fixed
neither
will
he
turn
his
gaze
towards
any
one
except
his
such
a
man
will
with
his
inner
eye
readily
recognize
how
altogether
vain
and
fleeting
are
the
things
of
this
world
and
will
set
his
affections
on
things
above
say
be
ashamed
o
ye
that
call
yourselves
the
lovers
of
the
ancient
beauty

ye
admonished
by
the
tribulation
he
hath
suffered
by
the
burden
of
anguish
he
hath
carried
for
the
sake
of
god
let
your
eyes
be
opened
to
what
purpose
hath
he
labored
if
the
manifold
trials
he
hath
endured
are
in
the
end
to
result
in
such
contemptible
professions
and
such
wretched
conduct
every
robber
every
worker
of
iniquity
hath
in
the
days
prior
to
my
revelation
uttered
these

words
and
performed
these

deeds
verily
i
say
incline
your
ears
to
my
sweet
voice
and
sanctify
yourselves
from
the
defilement
of
your
evil
passions
and
corrupt
desires
they
who
dwell
within
the
tabernacle
of
god

are
established
upon
the

of
everlasting

refuse
though
they
be
dying
of
hunger
to
stretch
their
hands
and
seize
unlawfully
the
property
of
their
neighbor
however
vile
and
worthless
he
may
be
the
purpose
of
the
one
true
god
in
manifesting
himself
is
to
summon
all
mankind
to
truthfulness
and
sincerity
to
piety
and
trustworthiness
to
resignation
and
submissiveness
to
the
will
of
god
to
forbearance

to

his

is
to
array
every
man
with
the
mantle

a
saintly
character

him
with
the

of
holy

cleanse

the

as
soon
as
the

of

shed
its
radiance
upon

my

ordained
revelation
may
be
likened
unto
an
ocean
in
whose
depths
are
concealed
innumerable
pearls
of

price
of
surpassing
luster
it
is
the
duty
of
every
seeker
to
bestir
himself
and
strive
to
attain
the
shores
of
this
ocean
so
that
he
may
in
proportion
to
the
eagerness
of
his
search
and
the
efforts
he
hath
exerted
partake
of
such
benefits
as
have
been
in
god
s
irrevocable
and
hidden
tablets
if
no
one
be
willing
to
direct
his
steps
towards
its
shores
if
every
one
should
fail
to
arise
and
find
him
can
such
a
failure
be
said
to
have
robbed
this
ocean
of
its
power
or
to
have
lessened
to
any
degree
its
treasures

vain
how
contemptible

its
flight

the

whence
it

shake
off
the
burden
weighing
on
its
sullied
wings

concealed
in

summoned
the

to
emerge
from

those

however
who
in

have
been
led
to
assail
in

the

according

to
refute
the

of

that
have

there
is
none

were
to
arise
to
defend
in

the

against

assailants
such

however
inconsiderable
his
share
shall
be
so
honored
in

clv
the
first
duty
prescribed

for

the

is
the

of

whoso
achieveth
this

hath
attained
unto
all

and
whoso
is
deprived
thereof
hath
gone
astray

of

in

the
security
of
its

he
that
turneth
away
from

accounted
among

verily
have
commanded
you
to
refuse
the

thee
to
consecrate
thyself
to
the

whatsoever
hath
been

tablets
is
but
a
reflection
of
his
will
so
complete
must
be
thy
consecration
that
every
trace
of
worldly
desire
will
be
washed
from
thine

this

the

unity
do
thou
beseech
god
to
enable
thee
to
remain
steadfast
in
this
path
and
to
aid
thee
to
guide
the
peoples
of
the

to
him
who

manifest
and
sovereign
ruler
who
hath
revealed
himself
in

distinct

who
giveth
utterance
to
a
divine
and

message
this
is
the

certitude
they

the
worshipers
of
the
idol
which
their
imaginations
have
carved

who
call

such
men

accounted
among
the

to
this

he
verily

guide
thy

such
an
act
verily
excelleth
all
other
acts
in
the
sight
of
god
the
the
most
high
such
must
be
thy
steadfastness
in
the
cause
of
god
that
no

whatsoever
will
have
the

to
deter
thee
from
thy
duty
though
the
powers

though

with
thee
thou
must
remain
unshaken
be
unrestrained
as
the
wind
while
carrying
the
message
of
him
who
hath
caused
the
dawn
of
divine
guidance
to
break
consider
how

faithful
to
that
which
god
hath
ordained
bloweth
upon

as
bidden
by
its
creator
so
should
be
every
one
that
claimeth
to
be
a
lover
of
the
one
true
god
it
behoveth
him
to
fix
his
gaze
upon
the
fundamentals
of
his
faith
and
to
labor
diligently
for
its
propagation
wholly
for
the
sake
of
god
he
should
proclaim
his
message
and
with
that

spirit
accept
whatever
response
his
words
may
evoke
in
his
hearer
he
who
shall
accept
and

receive
his
reward

he
who
shall
turn
away
shall
receive
none
other
than
his
own
punishment
on
the
eve
of
our
departure
from

we
have
warned
the
faithful
to
anticipate
the
appearance
of
the
birds
of
darkness
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
croaking
of
the
raven
shall
be
raised
in
certain
lands
as
it
hath
been
heard
in
recent
years
whatever
may
betide
seek
refuge
in
the
one
true
god
that
he
may
shield
you
from
the
wiles
of
the
impostor
verily
i
say
in
this
most
mighty
revelation
all
the
dispensations
of
the
past
have
attained
their

their
final
consummation
thus
counselleth
you

when
in

he

the

neither
