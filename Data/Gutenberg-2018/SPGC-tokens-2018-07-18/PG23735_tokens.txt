my

sherrod
in
whose
joyous
company
i
journeyed
through
the
wonderland
of
introduction
it
was
a
glad
day
in
the
olden
time
when
the
came
to
cottage
or
hall
at
christmas
or
new
year
when
the
stood
on
the
village
green
or
the
chestnuts
were
roasting
in
the
coals
on
eve
come
when
he
would
he
was
always
welcome
and
if
when
he
was
least
expected
he
knocked
at
the
door
what
joy
there
was
many
were
the
miles
that
the
had
traveled
and
many
were
the
places
where
he
had
been
and
many
were
the
tales
he
had
to
tell
of
what
he
had
seen
and
what
he
had
heard
in
the
wide
world
sometimes
his
voice
was
deep
and
sweet
as
the
organ
in
church
on
sunday
and
sometimes
it
rang
out
clear
as
a
bugle
and
sometimes
as
the
tale
went
on
he
would
take
the
harp
which
was
ever
by
his
side
and
touching
it
with
skilful
fingers
would
weave
a
gay
little
song
or
a
tender
strain
of
music
into
his
story
like
a
jeweled
thread
in
a
golden
web
all
the
children
gathered
around
him
sturdy
gilbert
and
rosy
jocelyn
roguish
giles
and
slender
rosalind
eager
for
a
story
mother
and
father
drew
near
and
in
the
background
stood
the
servants
smiling
but
silent
oh
everything
was
still
as
the
house
at
midnight
as
the
began
his
magic
words
once
upon
a
time
perhaps
the
story
brought
with
it
laughter
or
perhaps
a
tear
but
life
said
the
is
made
up
of
smiles
and
tears
and
the
little
ones
listening
to
him
learned
to
rejoice
with
those
whose
joy
was
great
and
to
mourn
with
the
sorrowful
and
were
the
better
and
not
the
worse
for
it
and
so
in
due
time
grew
into
noble
men
and
good
women
it
is
many
and
many
a
year
since
they
lived
and
died
but
still
knock
knock
knock
the
comes
with
his
harp
and
his
story
to
every
child
heart
open
the
door
and
let
him
come
in
give
him
a
seat
by
the
fire
and
gather
close
about
him
and
then
you

each
saw
that
the
other
was
his
brother
she
took
the
little
prince
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
the
harper
was
happier
than
a
king
as
he
sat
by
his
own
fireside
something
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
stop
karl
and
eat
yes
there
they
came
she
saw
an
as
full
of
apples
as
her
was
full
of
plums
one
of
them
took
it
in
his
mouth
and
so
brought
it
safely
to
hans
a
bear
cried
the
tailor
she
leaned
on
the
fence
that
divided
the
two
straight
to
the
enchanted
wood
they
went
while
she
was
watching
and
waiting
the
flower
burst
into
bloom
when
he
had
come
to
the
lions
he
found
that
they
were
chained
the
the
two
brothers
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
two
brothers
who
when
they
were
children
were
so
seldom
apart
that
those
who
saw
one
always
looked
for
the
other
at
his
heels
but
when
they
had
grown
to
manhood
and
the
time
had
come
when
they
must
make
their
own
fortunes
the
elder
brother
said
to
the
younger
choose
as
you
will
what
you
shall
do
and
god
bless
your
choice
but
as
for
me
i
shall
make
haste
to
the
court
of
the
king
for
nothing
will
satisfy
me
but
to
serve
him
and
my
country
good
fortune
and
a
blessing
go
with
you
said
the
younger
brother
i
too
should
like
to
serve
my
country
and
the
king
but
i
have
neither
words
nor
wit
for
a
king
court
to
hammer
a
shoe
from
the
glowing
iron
while
the
red
fire
roars
and
the
anvil
rings
this
is
the
work
that
i
do
best
and
i
shall
be
a
blacksmith
even
as
my
father
was
before
me
so
when
he
had
spoken
the
two
brothers
embraced
and
bade
each
other
and
went
on
their
ways
nor
did
they
meet
again
till
many
a
year
had
come
and
gone
the
elder
brother
rode
to
the
king
court
just
as
he
had
said
he
would
and
as
time
went
on
he
won
great
honor
there
and
was
made
one
of
the
king
counselors
and
the
younger
brother
built
himself
a
blacksmith
shop
by
the
side
of
a
road
and
worked
there
merrily
from
early
morn
till
the
stars
shone
at
night
he
was
called
the
mighty
blacksmith
because
of
his
strength
and
the
honest
blacksmith
because
he
charged
no
more
than
his
work
was
worth
and
the
master
blacksmith
because
no
other
smith
in
the
countryside
could
shoe
a
horse
so
well
and
speedily
as
he
and
he
was
envious
of
nobody
for
always
as
he
worked
his
hammer
seemed
to
sing
to
him
cling
clang
cling
cling
clang
cling
he
who
does
his
very
best
is
fit
to
serve
the
king
now
in
those
days
news
came
to
the
king
of
the
country
where
the
two
brothers
lived
that
the
duke
of
the
next
kingdom
had
made
threats
against
him
and
against
his
people
and
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
land
some
of
the
king
counselors
wanted
him
to
gather
his
armies
and
march
at
once
into
the
duke
kingdom
if
we
do
not
make
war
upon
him
he
will
make
war
upon
us
they
said
but
some
of
the
king
counselors
loved
peace
and
among
these
was
the
elder
brother
in
whom
the
king
had
great
trust
let
me
i
pray
you
ride
to
the
duke
castle
he
said
to
the
king
that
we
may
learn
from
his
own
lips
if
he
is
friend
or
foe
for
much
is
told
that
is
not
true
and
it
is
easier
to
begin
a
fight
than
it
is
to
end
one
the
king
was
well
pleased
with
all
the
elder
brother
said
and
bade
him
go
but
if
by
the
peal
of
the
noon
bells
on
the
day
before
christmas
you
have
neither
brought
nor
sent
a
message
of
good
will
from
the
duke
to
me
then
shall
those
who
want
war
have
their
way
he
said
and
with
this
the
elder
brother
had
to
be
content
day
and
night
he
rode
to
the
duke
castle
and
day
and
night
when
his
errand
was
done
he
hastened
home
again
but
the
way
was
long
and
a
strong
wind
had
blown
away
the
which
guided
travelers
so
though
he
stopped
neither
to
sleep
in
a
bed
or
eat
at
a
table
the
whole
journey
through
the
early
hours
of
the
day
before
christmas
found
him
still
far
from
the
king
palace
and
to
make
matters
worse
in
the
loneliest
part
of
the
road
the
good
horse
that
had
carried
him
so
well
lost
a
shoe
alack
and
alas
for
the
want
of
a
nail
the
horseshoe
is
lost
and
my
good
horse
will
fail
for
the
want
of
the
shoe
and
i
shall
be
late
for
want
of
a
steed
and
my
message
must
wait
for
want
of
a
bearer
and
woe
is
our
plight
for
want
of
the
message
the
king
needs
must
fight
cried
the
elder
brother
then
and
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
saddle
and
wept
for
where
to
turn
for
help
he
did
not
know
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
and
no
other
traveler
was
on
the
road
nor
could
he
see
through
the
dim
light
of
dawn
a
house
or
where
he
might
ask
aid
but
as
he
wept
he
heard
a
distant
sound
that
was
sweeter
than
music
to
his
ears
cling
clang
cling
cling
clang
cling
footnote
adapted
from
the
old
proverb
for
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
was
lost
etc
only
a
blacksmith
plays
that
tune
he
cried
and
he
urged
his
horse
on
joyfully
calling
as
he
went
smith
smith
if
you
love
country
and
king
shoe
my
horse
and
shoe
him
speedily
it
was
not
long
before
he
spied
the
fire
of
a
roadside
smithy
glaring
out
upon
him
like
a
great
red
eye
and
when
he
reached
the
door
of
the
shop
he
found
the
smith
ready
and
waiting
for
his
task
cling
clang
cling
how
the
iron
rang
beneath
his
mighty
stroke
and
cling
clang
cling
how
the
hammer
sang
as
the
shoe
was
pounded
into
shape
by
the
time
the
sun
was
over
the
hill
the
horse
was
shod
and
the
rider
was
in
his
saddle
again
but
the
blacksmith
would
take
no
money
for
his
work
to
serve
my
country
and
the
king
is
pay
enough
for
me
he
said
and
he
stood
up
straight
and
tall
and
looked
the
king
counselor
in
the
eyes
and
lo
and
behold
as
the
morning
light
fell
on
their
faces
each
saw
that
the
other
was
his
brother
god
bless
you
brother
and
god
speed
you
brother
was
all
that
they
had
time
to
say
but
that
was
enough
to
show
that
love
was
still
warm
in
their
hearts
then
away
and
away
and
away
through
the
sun
and
the
dew
rode
the
elder
brother
away
and
away
over
hill
and
dale
toward
the
palace
the
king
and
his
counselors
were
watching
and
waiting
there
and
as
the
sun
climbed
high
and
the
message
did
not
come
those
who
wanted
war
said
shall
we
not
saddle
our
horses
and
call
up
our
men
the
bells
in
the
steeple
have
yet
to
ring
for
noon
said
the
and
we
see
a
dust
on
the
king
highway
dust
flies
before
wind
said
the
warriors
and
it
is
likelier
that
our
messenger
lies
in
the
duke
prison
than
rides
on
the
highway
but
with
the
dust
came
the
sound
of
flying
hoofs
faster
faster
faster
they
came
when
the
first
stroke
of
the
noon
hour
pealed
from
the
church
steeple
the
king
messenger
was
in
sight
and
the
last
bell
had
not
rung
when
he
stood
before
the
palace
gate
to
deliver
the
duke
message
peace
and
good
will
to
you
and
yours
and
to
all
a
merry
christmas
then
the
king
sent
for
fine
robes
and
a
golden
chain
to
be
brought
for
the
elder
brother
and
put
a
purse
of
gold
in
his
hand
for
he
was
well
pleased
with
what
he
had
done
but
the
elder
brother
would
have
none
of
these
things
for
himself
alone
try
as
i
would
i
must
have
failed
had
it
not
been
for
my
brother
the
blacksmith
who
shod
my
horse
on
the
road
he
said
and
if
it
please
your
majesty
half
of
all
you
give
to
me
i
will
give
to
him
two
good
servants
are
better
than
one
said
the
king
and
he
sent
for
the
younger
brother
that
he
might
thank
him
also
then
the
two
brothers
were
clothed
alike
and
feasted
alike
and
each
had
a
purse
of
gold
and
whenever
one
was
praised
so
was
the
other
and
they
lived
happily
each
in
his
own
work
all
the
days
of
their
lives
the
jar
of
rosemary
there
was
once
a
little
prince
whose
mother
the
queen
was
sick
all
summer
she
lay
in
bed
and
everything
was
kept
quiet
in
the
palace
but
when
the
autumn
came
she
grew
better
every
day
brought
color
to
her
cheeks
and
strength
to
her
limbs
and
by
and
by
the
little
prince
was
allowed
to
go
into
her
room
and
stand
beside
her
bed
to
talk
to
her
he
was
very
glad
of
this
for
he
wanted
to
ask
her
what
she
would
like
for
a
christmas
present
and
as
soon
as
he
had
kissed
her
and
laid
his
cheek
against
hers
he
whispered
his
question
in
her
ear
what
should
i
like
for
a
christmas
present
said
the
queen
a
smile
and
a
kiss
and
a
hug
around
the
neck
these
are
the
dearest
gifts
i
know
but
the
prince
was
not
satisfied
with
this
answer
smiles
and
kisses
and
hugs
you
can
have
every
day
he
said
but
think
mother
think
if
you
could
choose
the
thing
you
wanted
most
in
all
the
world
what
would
you
take
so
the
queen
thought
and
thought
and
at
last
she
said
if
i
might
take
my
choice
of
all
the
world
i
believe
a
little
jar
of
rosemary
like
that
which
bloomed
in
my
mother
window
when
i
was
a
little
girl
would
please
me
better
than
anything
else
the
little
prince
was
delighted
to
hear
this
and
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
out
of
the
queen
room
he
sent
a
servant
to
his
greenhouses
to
inquire
for
a
rosemary
plant
but
the
servant
came
back
with
disappointing
news
there
were
carnation
pinks
in
the
king
greenhouses
and
roses
with
golden
hearts
and
lovely
lilies
but
there
was
no
rosemary
rosemary
was
a
common
herb
and
grew
mostly
in
country
gardens
so
the
gardeners
said
then
go
into
the
country
for
it
said
the
little
prince
no
matter
where
it
grows
my
mother
must
have
it
for
a
christmas
present
so
messengers
went
into
the
country
here
there
and
everywhere
to
seek
the
plant
but
each
one
came
back
with
the
same
story
to
tell
there
was
rosemary
enough
and
to
spare
in
the
spring
but
the
frost
had
been
in
the
country
and
there
was
not
a
green
sprig
left
to
bring
to
the
little
prince
for
his
mother
christmas
present
two
days
before
christmas
however
news
was
brought
that
rosemary
had
been
found
a
lovely
green
plant
growing
in
a
jar
right
in
the
very
city
where
the
prince
himself
lived
but
where
is
it
said
he
why
have
you
not
brought
it
with
you
go
and
get
it
at
once
well
as
for
that
said
the
servant
who
had
found
the
plant
there
is
a
little
difficulty
the
old
woman
to
whom
the
rosemary
belongs
did
not
want
to
sell
it
even
though
i
offered
her
a
handful
of
silver
for
it
then
give
her
a
purse
of
gold
said
the
little
prince
so
a
purse
filled
so
full
of
gold
that
it
could
not
hold
another
piece
was
taken
to
the
old
woman
but
presently
it
was
brought
back
she
would
not
sell
her
rosemary
no
not
even
for
a
purse
of
gold
perhaps
if
your
little
highness
would
go
yourself
and
ask
her
she
might
change
her
mind
said
the
prince
nurse
so
the
royal
carriage
drawn
by
six
white
horses
was
brought
and
the
little
prince
and
his
servants
rode
away
to
the
old
woman
house
and
when
they
got
there
the
first
thing
they
spied
was
the
little
green
plant
in
a
jar
standing
in
the
old
woman
window
the
old
woman
herself
came
to
the
door
and
she
was
glad
to
see
the
little
prince
she
invited
him
in
and
bade
him
warm
his
hands
by
the
fire
and
gave
him
a
cooky
from
her
cupboard
to
eat
she
had
a
little
grandson
no
older
than
the
prince
but
he
was
sick
and
could
not
run
about
and
play
like
other
children
he
lay
in
a
little
white
bed
in
the
old
woman
room
and
the
little
prince
after
he
had
eaten
the
cooky
spoke
to
him
and
took
out
his
favorite
plaything
which
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
him
the
prince
favorite
plaything
was
a
ball
which
was
like
no
other
ball
that
had
ever
been
made
it
was
woven
of
magic
stuff
as
bright
as
the
sunlight
as
sparkling
as
the
starlight
and
as
golden
as
the
moon
at
harvest
time
and
when
the
little
prince
threw
it
into
the
air
or
bounced
it
on
the
floor
or
turned
it
in
his
hands
it
rang
like
a
chime
of
silver
bells
the
sick
child
laughed
to
hear
it
and
held
out
his
hands
for
it
and
the
prince
let
him
hold
it
which
pleased
the
grandmother
as
much
as
the
child
but
pleased
though
she
was
she
would
not
sell
the
rosemary
she
had
brought
it
from
the
home
where
she
had
lived
when
her
little
grandson
father
was
a
boy
she
said
and
she
hoped
to
keep
it
till
she
died
so
the
prince
and
his
servants
had
to
go
home
without
it
no
sooner
had
they
gone
than
the
sick
child
began
to
talk
of
the
wonderfull
ball
if
i
had
such
a
ball
to
hold
in
my
hand
he
said
i
should
be
contented
all
the
day
you
may
as
well
wish
for
the
moon
in
the
sky
said
his
grandmother
but
she
thought
of
what
he
said
and
in
the
evening
when
he
was
asleep
she
put
her
shawl
around
her
and
taking
the
jar
of
rosemary
with
her
she
hastened
to
the
king
palace
when
she
got
there
the
servants
asked
her
errand
but
she
would
answer
nothing
till
they
had
taken
her
to
the
little
prince
silver
and
gold
would
not
buy
the
rosemary
she
said
when
she
saw
him
but
if
you
will
give
me
your
golden
ball
for
my
little
grandchild
you
may
have
the
plant
but
my
ball
is
the
most
wonderful
ball
that
was
ever
made
cried
the
little
prince
and
it
is
my
favorite
plaything
i
would
not
give
it
away
for
anything
and
so
the
old
woman
had
to
go
home
with
her
jar
of
rosemary
under
her
shawl
the
next
day
was
the
day
before
christmas
and
there
was
a
great
stir
and
bustle
in
the
palace
the
queen
physician
had
said
that
she
might
sit
up
to
see
the
christmas
tree
that
night
and
have
her
presents
with
the
rest
of
the
family
and
every
one
was
running
to
and
fro
to
get
things
in
readiness
for
her
the
queen
had
so
many
presents
and
very
fine
they
were
too
that
the
christmas
tree
could
not
hold
them
all
so
they
were
put
on
a
table
before
the
throne
and
wreathed
around
with
holly
and
with
pine
the
little
prince
went
in
with
his
nurse
to
see
them
and
to
put
his
gift
which
was
a
jewel
among
them
she
wanted
a
jar
of
rosemary
he
said
as
he
looked
at
the
glittering
heap
she
will
never
think
of
it
again
when
she
sees
these
things
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
the
nurse
but
the
little
prince
was
not
sure
he
thought
of
it
himself
many
times
that
day
and
once
when
he
was
playing
with
his
ball
he
said
to
the
nurse
if
i
had
a
rosemary
plant
i
be
willing
to
sell
it
for
a
purse
full
of
gold
would
you
indeed
yes
said
the
nurse
and
so
would
any
one
else
in
his
right
senses
you
may
be
sure
of
that
the
little
boy
was
not
satisfied
though
and
presently
when
he
had
put
his
ball
up
and
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
snow
which
had
come
to
whiten
the
earth
for
christ
birthday
he
said
to
the
nurse
i
wish
it
were
spring
it
is
easy
to
get
rosemary
then
is
it
not
your
little
highness
is
like
the
king
parrot
that
knows
but
one
word
with
your
rosemary
rosemary
rosemary
said
the
nurse
who
was
a
little
out
of
patience
by
that
time
her
majesty
the
queen
only
asked
for
it
to
please
you
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
the
little
prince
was
not
sure
and
when
the
nurse
had
gone
to
her
supper
and
he
was
left
by
chance
for
a
moment
alone
he
put
on
his
coat
of
fur
and
taking
the
ball
with
him
he
slipped
away
from
the
palace
and
hastened
toward
the
old
woman
house
he
had
never
been
out
at
night
by
himself
before
and
he
might
have
felt
a
little
afraid
had
it
not
been
for
the
friendly
stars
that
twinkled
in
the
sky
above
him
we
will
show
you
the
way
they
seemed
to
say
and
he
trudged
on
bravely
in
their
light
till
by
and
by
he
came
to
the
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
illustration
she
took
the
little
prince
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
now
the
little
sick
child
had
been
talking
of
the
wonderful
ball
all
the
evening
did
you
see
how
it
shone
grandmother
and
did
you
hear
how
the
little
bells
rang
he
said
and
it
was
just
then
that
the
little
prince
knocked
at
the
door
the
old
woman
made
haste
to
answer
the
knock
and
when
she
saw
the
prince
she
was
too
astonished
to
speak
here
is
the
ball
he
cried
putting
it
into
her
hands
please
give
me
the
rosemary
for
my
mother
and
so
it
happened
that
when
the
queen
sat
down
before
her
great
table
of
gifts
the
first
thing
she
spied
was
a
jar
of
sweet
rosemary
like
that
which
had
bloomed
in
her
mother
window
when
she
was
a
little
girl
i
should
rather
have
it
than
all
the
other
gifts
in
the
world
she
said
and
she
took
the
little
prince
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
the
promise
a
christmas
wonder
story
for
older
children
there
was
once
a
harper
who
played
such
beautiful
music
and
sang
such
beautiful
songs
that
his
fame
spread
throughout
the
whole
land
and
at
last
the
king
heard
of
him
and
sent
messengers
to
bring
him
to
the
palace
footnote
this
story
was
suggested
by
an
old
poem
told
to
me
by
miss
harriette
mills
which
recounted
the
adventures
of
a
father
who
braved
the
snows
of
an
alpine
pass
to
reach
his
home
on
christmas
day
i
will
neither
eat
nor
sleep
till
i
have
seen
your
face
and
heard
the
sound
of
your
harp
this
was
the
message
the
king
sent
to
the
harper
the
messengers
said
it
over
and
over
until
they
knew
it
by
heart
and
when
they
reached
the
harper
house
they
called
hail
harper
come
out
and
listen
for
we
have
something
to
tell
you
that
will
make
you
glad
but
when
the
harper
heard
the
king
message
he
was
sad
for
he
had
a
wife
and
a
child
and
a
little
brown
dog
and
he
was
sorry
to
leave
them
and
they
were
sorry
to
have
him
go
stay
with
us
they
begged
but
the
harper
said
i
go
for
it
would
be
discourtesy
to
disappoint
the
king
but
as
sure
as
holly
berries
are
red
and
pine
is
green
i
will
come
back
by
christmas
day
to
eat
my
share
of
the
christmas
pudding
and
sing
the
christmas
songs
by
my
own
fireside
and
when
he
had
promised
this
he
hung
his
harp
upon
his
back
and
went
away
with
the
messengers
to
the
king
palace
when
he
got
there
the
king
welcomed
him
with
joy
and
many
things
were
done
in
his
honor
he
slept
on
a
bed
of
softest
down
and
ate
from
a
plate
of
gold
at
the
king
own
table
and
when
he
sang
everybody
and
everything
from
the
king
himself
to
the
mouse
in
the
palace
pantry
stood
still
to
listen
no
matter
what
he
was
doing
however
feasting
or
resting
singing
or
listening
to
praises
he
never
forgot
the
promise
that
he
had
made
to
his
wife
and
his
child
and
his
little
brown
dog
and
when
the
day
before
christmas
came
he
took
his
harp
in
his
hand
and
went
to
bid
the
king
now
the
king
was
loath
to
have
the
harper
leave
him
and
he
said
to
him
i
will
give
you
a
horse
that
is
white
as
milk
as
glossy
as
satin
and
fleet
as
a
deer
if
you
will
stay
to
play
and
sing
before
my
throne
on
christmas
day
but
the
harper
answered
i
can
not
stay
for
i
have
a
wife
and
a
child
and
a
little
brown
dog
and
i
have
promised
them
to
be
at
home
by
christmas
day
to
eat
my
share
of
the
christmas
pudding
and
sing
the
christmas
songs
by
my
own
fireside
then
the
king
said
if
you
will
stay
to
play
and
sing
before
my
throne
on
christmas
day
i
will
give
to
you
a
wonderful
tree
that
summer
or
winter
is
never
bare
and
silver
and
gold
will
fall
for
you
whenever
you
shake
this
little
tree
but
the
harper
said
i
must
not
stay
for
my
wife
and
my
child
and
my
little
brown
dog
are
waiting
for
me
and
i
have
promised
them
to
be
at
home
by
christmas
day
to
eat
my
share
of
the
christmas
pudding
and
sing
the
christmas
songs
by
my
own
fireside
then
the
king
said
if
you
will
stay
on
christmas
day
one
tune
to
play
and
one
song
to
sing
i
will
give
you
a
velvet
robe
to
wear
and
you
may
sit
beside
me
here
with
a
ring
on
your
finger
and
a
crown
on
your
head
but
the
harper
answered
i
not
stay
for
my
wife
and
my
child
and
my
little
brown
dog
are
watching
for
me
and
i
have
promised
them
to
be

by
christmas
day
to
eat
my
share
of
the
christmas
pudding
and
sing
the
christmas
songs
by
my
own
fireside
and
he
wrapped
his
old
cloak
about
him
and
hung
his
harp
upon
his
back
and
went
out
from
the
king
palace
without
another
word
he
had
not
gone
far
when
the
little
white
came
fluttering
down
from
the
skies
harper
stay
they
seemed
to
say
do
not
venture
out
but
the
harper
said
the
snow
may
fall
but
i
must
go
for
i
have
a
wife
and
a
child
and
a
little
brown
dog
and
i
have
promised
them
to
be
at

by
christmas
day
to
eat
my
share
of
the
christmas
pudding
and
sing
the
christmas
songs
by
my
own
fireside
then
the
snow
fell
thick
and
the
snow
fell
fast
the
hills
and
the
valleys
the
hedges
and
hollows
were
white
the
paths
were
all
hidden
and
there
were
drifts
like
mountains
on
the
king
highway
the
harper
stumbled
and
the
harper
fell
but
he
would
not
turn
back
and
as
he
traveled
he
met
the
wind
brother
harper
turn
i
pray
do
not
journey
on
sang
the
wind
but
the
harper
would
not
heed
snows
may
fall
and
winds
may
blow
but
i
must
go
on
he
said
for
i
have
a

and
a

and
a

and

by
my
own
fireside
then
the
wind
blew
an
icy
blast
the
snow
froze
on
the
ground
and
the
water
froze
in
the
rivers
the
harper
breath
froze
in
the
air
and
icicles
as
long
as
the
king
sword
hung
from
the
rocks
on
the
highway
the
harper
shivered
and
the
harper
shook
but
he
would
not
turn
back
and
by
and
by
he
came
to
the
forest
that
lay
between
him
and
his
home
the
trees
of
the
forest
were
creaking
and
bending
in
the
wind
and
every
one
of
them
seemed
to
say
darkness
gathers
night
is
near
harper
stop
do
venture
here
but
the
harper
would
not
stop
snows
may
fall
winds
may
blow
and
night
may
come

i
have
promised
to
be
at

of
the
christmas
pudding
and
sing
the

by
my
own

i
must
go
on
and
on
he
went
till
the
last
glimmer
of
daylight
faded
and
there
was
darkness
everywhere
but
the
harper
was
not
afraid
of
the
dark
if
i
can
not
see
i
can
sing
said
he
and
he
sang
in
the
forest
joyously
sing
glory

bless

on

the
harper
was
happier
than

by

the

ceased
its
falling
the

ceased
its

the

bowed
down
to
listen
and
lo
dear
children
as
he
sang
the
darkness
turned
to
wondrous
light
and
close
at
hand
the
harper
saw
the
open
doorway
of
his
home
the
wife
and
the
child
and
the
little
brown
dog
were
watching
and
waiting
and
they
welcomed
the
harper
with
great
joy
the
holly
berries
were
red
in
the
christmas
wreaths
their
christmas
tree
was
a
young
green
pine
the
christmas
pudding
was
full
of
plums

the
plate
of
pancakes
once
upon
a
time
a
woman
was
frying
some
pancakes
and
as
she
turned
the
last
cake
in
the
pan
she
said
to
her
little
boy
if
you
were
a
little
older
i
should
send
you
with
some
of
these
fine
cakes
for
your
father
dinner
but
as
it
is
he
must
wait
till
supper
for
them
oh
do
let
me
take
them
said
the
little
boy
whose
name
was
karl
just
see
how
tall
i
am
and
only
yesterday
my
grandmother
said
i
was
old
enough
to
learn
my
letters
do
let
me
go
and
he
begged
and
begged
till
at
last
she
selected
the
brownest
and
crispest
cakes
and
putting
them
in
a
plate
with
a
white
napkin
over
them
she
bade
him
take
them
now
the
path
that
led
from
karl
home
to
the
where
his
father
worked
was
straight
enough
and
plain
enough
but
it
ran
through
the
wood
that
was
called
enchanted
fairies
lived
there
so
some
people
thought
and
goblins
that
liked
to
work
mischief
and
never
before
had
the
little
boy
been
allowed
to
go
there
alone
as
he
hurried
along
with
the
plate
of
pancakes
in
his
hand
he
glanced
into
every
green
thicket
that
he
passed
half
hopeful
and
half
fearful
that
he
might
find
a
tiny
creature
hidden
in
the
leaves
not
a
glimpse
of
fairy
or
goblin
did
he
see
but
when
he
came
to
the
blackberry
bushes
where
the
sweetest
berries
grow
something
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
stop
karl
and
eat
but
i
am
taking
a
plate
of
pancakes
for
my
father
dinner
said
karl
speaking
aloud
a
moment
or
two
will
make
no
difference
you
can
run
fast
came
the
whisper
again
illustration
something
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
stop
karl
and
eat
oh
yes
i
can
run
fast
said
karl
and
he
put
the
plate
down
under
the
bushes
and
began
to
pick
the
berries
they
were
as
ripe
and
sweet
as
they
had
looked
and
every
one
that
the
little
boy
put
into
his
mouth
made
him
wish
for
another
and
if
he
turned
away
from
the
bushes
the
whisper
was
sure
to
come
one
more
and
then
go
the
pancakes
grew
cold
in
the
plate
and
the
sun
which
had
been
high
in
the
sky
when
karl
started
from
home
slipped
farther
and
farther
into
the
west
but
still
he
lingered
till
suddenly
the
evening
whistle
of
the
mill
sounded
sharp
and
shrill
in
his
ears
why
it
is
time
for
my
father
to
come
home
he
cried
dear
me
dear
me
what
shall
i
do
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
go
home
so
home
he
went
with
the
plate
of
cold
pancakes
in
his
hand
and
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
when
he
told
his
mother
and
grandmother
what
had
happened
they
looked
at
each
other
wisely
as
if
they
thought
more
about
it
than
they
would
say
but
they
bade
him
dry
his
tears
you
will
be
more
careful
another
time
they
said
and
so
the
matter
ended
but
karl
did
not
forget
it
it
was
many
a
month
before
his
mother
fried
pancakes
again
but
no
sooner
did
he
see
her
turning
the
cakes
in
the
pan
than
he
said
i
wish
my
father
had
some
of
these
fine
cakes
for
his
dinner
you
mother
indeed
i
do
said
she
smiling
at
his
grandmother
as
she
spoke
and
as
soon
as
the
cakes
were
done
she
selected
the
brownest
and
crispest
and
putting
them
in
a
plate
with
a
white
napkin
over
them
she
bade
him
take
them
i
get
there
in
time
for
my
father
dinner
he
said
as
he
started
out
but
in
a
very
short
while
he
was
back
with
an
empty
plate
in
his
hand
and
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
i
only
put
the
plate
down
for
a
minute
while
i
chased
a
rabbit
that
said
you
catch
me
you
may
have
me
and
when
i
came
back
every
pancake
was
gone
he
sobbed
his
mother
and
grandmother
looked
at
each
other
wisely
when
they
heard
this
it
is
just
as
i
thought
the
first
time
said
his
mother
the
goblins
are
at
work
in
the
wood
he
must
never
go
there
again
but
to
this
the
grandmother
would
not
agree
leave
it
to
me
she
said
and
the
very
next
day
she
fried
pancakes
and
selecting
the
brownest
and
crispest
she
put
them
in
a
plate
with
a
white
napkin
over
them
and
bade
karl
take
them
to
his
father
and
if
any
bid
you
stop
or
stay
or
turn
your
feet
from
out
your
way
say
but
the
word
that
is
spelled
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
letters
of
the
alphabet
three
times
in
a
loud
voice
and
all
will
go
well
with
you
she
said
all
right
said
karl
nodding
his
head
proudly
for
he
knew
all
his
letters
by
this
time
and
could
spell
hard
words
like
cat
mat
all
right
but
he
did
not
stop
to
count
the
letters
then
for
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
be
off
i
guess
my
father
will
be
glad
to
get
such
fine
pancakes
for
his
dinner
he
said
and
he
ran
so
fast
that
he
was
to
the
mill
before
he
knew
it
there
was
no
whispering
voice
in
the
wood
that
day
and
no
talking
rabbit
to
tempt
him
to
a
chase
but
as
he
came
to
a
place
where
another
path
crossed
his
own
a
bird
called
out
from
the
heart
of
the
wood
quick
quick
come
here
here
here
where
where
cried
karl
and
he
was
just
about
to
start
in
search
of
the
bird
when
he
remembered
what
his
grandmother
had
said
if
any
bid
you
stop
or
stay
or
turn
your
feet
from
out
your
way
say
but
the
word
that
is
spelled
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
letters
of
the
alphabet
three
times
in
a
loud
voice
and
all
will
go
well
with
you
a
b

he
chanted
counting
the
letters
on
his
fingers
as
he
said
them
h
i
j
k
l
m
n
o
n
was
the
fourteenth
letter
and
o
was
the
fifteenth
that
was
easy
no
no
no
he
shouted
and
do
you
believe
it
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
he
was
at
the
mill
door
with
every
pancake
safe
and
hot
and
the
story
goes
that
though
he
came
and
went
through
the
enchanted
wood
all
the
days
of
his
life
he
was
never
hindered
by
anything
there
again
and
he
never
saw
a
goblin
though
he
lived
to
be
as
old
as
his
grandmother
had
been
when
he
was
a
little
boy
little
maid
hildegarde
one
evening
little
maid
hildegarde
father
came
home
with
wonderful
news
the
knights
were
coming
to
town
he
had
heard
it
as
he
came
from
the
forest
where
he
cut
wood
all
day
and
he
hurried
every
step
of
the
way
home
to
tell
hildegarde
and
her
mother
they
are
on
the
king
business
and
will
be
at
the
church
square
morning
at
the
hour
of
ten
everybody
in
town
will
be
there
to
see
them
old
grandmother
grey
is
going
to
ask
them
to
ride
in
search
of
her
little
lamb
that
has
gone
astray
and
the
mayor
will
tell
them
of
the
wolves
that
come
in
the
winter
the
good
knights
are
always
glad
to
help
he
said
little
maid
hildegarde
knew
all
about
the
knights
her
father
was
never
tired
of
telling
or
she
of
hearing
how
they
fought
and
killed
the
fierce
dragon
that
had
troubled
the
people
of
the
border
and
put
out
the
forest
fires
in
the
time
of
the
great
drought
and
fed
the
hungry
when
the
famine
was
in
the
land
and
yet
with
all
of
their
great
deeds
they
were
merry
men
not
too
proud
to
sing
at
a
feast
or
play
with
a
child
and
many
an
evening
though
hildegarde
was
growing
to
be
a
great
girl
her
mother
sat
by
her
bed
to
sing
a
song
that
she
had
sung
to
her
when
she
was
a
babe
in
the
cradle
hush
my
baby
do
not
cry
five
brave
knights
go
riding
by
one
is
dressed
in
bonny
blue
he
the
leader
strong
and
true
one
is
clad
from
head
to
toe
in
an
armor
white
as
snow
one
in
crimson
bright
is
drest
with
a
star
upon
his
breast
one
in
gold
and
one
in
green
cloth
of
gold
and
satin
sheen
hush
my
baby
do
not
cry
five
brave
knights
go
riding
by
oh
how
hildegarde
had
longed
to
see
those
splendid
riders
and
now
at
last
she
was
to
have
her
heart
desire
it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
shall
we
start
to
town
as
soon
as
the
new
day
comes
she
asked
just
as
soon
as
the
cows
are
taken
to
the
pasture
and
the
little
chicks
are
fed
said
her
mother
and
the
little
maid
went
to
bed
well
satisfied
but
alas
for
hildegarde
and
her
hopes
the
morning
sun
had
scarcely
shone
when
her
mother
awoke
with
a
terrible
pain
in
her
head
and
her
father
slipped
on
his
way
to
the
barn
and
sprained
his
foot
so
he
could
not
walk
and
there
was
no
one
to
take
the
child
to
the
church
square
no
not
even
a
neighbor
for
hildegarde
and
her
mother
and
father
lived
apart
from
every
one
else
and
the
wood
that
is
called
enchanted
lay
between
them
and
the
town
there
was
no
help
for
it
hildegarde
knew
herself
without
a
word
from
any
one
that
she
could
not
go
but
as
she
ran
about
the
house
to
wait
on
them
she
heard
her
mother
and
father
talking
it
is
not
for
the
pain
in
my
face
that
i
grieve
said
the
good
mother
but
for
the
disappointment
of
our
little
maid
aye
said
the
father
i
would
bear
my
hurt
and
more
too
willingly
if
only
she
might
see
the
gallant
knights
and
when
hildegarde
heard
what
they
said
she
made
haste
to
wipe
away
the
tears
that
threatened
to
roll
down
her
cheeks
and
went
about
her
work
with
a
pleasant
face
all
day
long
she
was
busy
for
there
were
the
cows
to
take
to
the
pasture
and
the
little
chicks
to
feed
and
the
eggs
to
gather
but
at
sunset
her
tasks
were
done
and
with
her
doll
in
her
arms
she
sat
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
looked
away
toward
the
town
the
towers
of
which
just
showed
above
the
enchanted
wood
highest
of
all
was
the
spire
of
the
church
that
stood
in
the
square
where
the
knights
had
been
and
as
hildegarde
watched
it
change
from
grey
to
gold
in
the
sunset
glow
she
thought
of
them
and
wondered
where
they
had
gone
when
their
business
was
done
some
day
they
would
come
again
and
then
she
should
surely
see
them
her
father
said
and
already
she
had
begun
to
look
forward
to
that
time
perhaps
they
will
come
when
the
wolves
do
in
the
winter
she
said
to
herself
but
scarcely
had
she
spoken
when
through
an
opening
in
the
wood
she
spied
a
horseman
riding
at
a
stately
pace
behind
him
came
another
and
another
till
she
had
counted
five
five
brave
knights
yes
there
they
came
with
prancing
steeds
and
shining
shields
and
splendid
clothes
one
bore
a
banner
blue
as
the
sky
on
a
summer
day
and
the
next
held
a
wee
lamb
close
within
his
arms
a
dragon
head
hung
from
saddle
and
two
had
bugles
by
their
sides
not
a
word
was
spoken
as
silently
as
the
stars
shine
out
at
evening
they
passed
the
door
where
the
child
sat
and
as
quietly
as
the
sun
goes
down
at
the
day
end
they
vanished
into
the
wood
again
before
she
could
move
or
call
but
just
as
the
green
of
the
last
one
coat
faded
away
into
the
green
of
the
trees
hildegarde
thought
she
heard
a
strain
of
sweetest
music
now
there
were
those
and
hildegarde
mother
and
father
were
among
them
who
believed
that
the
little
maid
tired
from
her
long
busy
day
had
fallen
asleep
and
dreamed
a
beautiful
dream
but
as
for
hildegarde
she
kept
the
vision
in
her
heart
alway
and
when
as
the
years
went
by
she
had
little
ones
of
her
own
to
rock
to
sleep
she
told
them
of
it
and
sang
to
them
as
her
mother
had
sung
to
her
illustration
music
five
brave
knights
words
maud
lindsay
air
old
song
hush
my
do
not
cry
five
brave
knights
go
by
one
is
dressed
in
blue
he
the
strong
and
true
one
is
clad
from
head
to
toe
in
an
white
as
snow
one
in
bright
is
drest
with
a
star
his
breast
one
in
gold
and
one
in
green
cloth
of
gold
and
sheen
hush
my
do
not
cry
five
brave
knights
go
by
illustration
yes
there
they
came
the
apple
dumpling
there
was
once
upon
a
time
an
old
woman
who
wanted
an
apple
dumpling
for
supper
she
had
plenty
of
flour
and
plenty
of
butter
plenty
of
sugar
and
plenty
of
spice
for
a
dozen
dumplings
but
there
was
one
thing
she
did
not
have
and
that
was
an
apple
she
had
plums
a
tree
full
of
them
the
roundest
and
reddest
that
you
can
imagine
but
though
you
can
make
butter
from
cream
and
raisins
of
grapes
you
can
not
make
an
apple
dumpling
with
plums
and
there
is
no
use
trying
the
more
the
old
woman
thought
of
the
dumpling
the
more
she
wanted
it
and
at
last
she
dressed
herself
in
her
sunday
best
and
started
out
to
seek
an
apple
before
she
left
home
however
she
filled
a
basket
with
plums
from
her
and
covering
it
over
with
a
white
cloth
hung
it
on
her
arm
for
she
said
to
herself
there
may
be
those
in
the
world
who
have
apples
and
need
plums
she
had
not
gone
very
far
when
she
came
to
a
poultry
yard
filled
with
fine
hens
and
geese
and
guineas
quawk
quawk
poterack
what
a
noise
they
made
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
a
young
woman
who
was
feeding
them
with
yellow
corn
she
nodded
pleasantly
to
the
old
woman
and
the
old
woman
nodded
to
her
and
soon
the
two
were
talking
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
always
the
young
woman
told
the
old
woman
about
her
fowls
and
the
old
woman
told
the
young
woman
about
the
dumpling
and
the
basket
of
plums
for
which
she
hoped
to
get
apples
dear
me
said
the
young
woman
when
she
heard
this
there
is
nothing
my
husband
likes
better
than
plum
jelly
with
goose
for
his
sunday
dinner
but
unless
you
will
take
a
bag
of
feathers
for
your
plums
he
must
do
without
for
that
is
the
best
i
can
offer
you
one
pleased
is
better
than
two
disappointed
said
the
old
woman
then
and
she
emptied
the
plums
into
the
young
woman
apron
and
putting
the
bag
of
feathers
into
her
basket
trudged
on
as
merrily
as
before
for
she
said
to
herself
if
i
am
no
nearer
the
dumpling
than
when
i
left
home
i
am
at
least
no
farther
from
it
and
that
feathers
are
lighter
to
carry
than
plums
nobody
can
deny
trudge
trudge
up
hill
and
down
she
went
and
presently
she
came
to
a
garden
of
sweet
flowers
lilies
lilacs
violets
roses
oh
never
was
there
a
lovelier
garden
the
old
woman
stopped
at
the
gate
to
look
at
the
flowers
and
as
she
looked
she
heard
a
man
and
a
woman
who
sat
on
the
of
a
house
that
stood
in
the
garden
quarreling
cotton
said
the
woman
straw
said
the
man
is
not
it
is
they
cried
and
so
it
went
between
them
till
they
spied
the
old
woman
at
the
gate
here
is
one
who
will
settle
the
matter
said
the
woman
then
and
she
called
to
the
old
woman
good
mother
answer
me
this
if
you
were
making
a
cushion
for
your
grandfather
chair
would
you
not
stuff
it
with
cotton
no
said
the
old
woman
i
told
you
so
cried
the
man
straw
is
the
thing
and
no
need
to
go
farther
than
the
barn
for
it
but
the
old
woman
shook
her
head
i
would
not
stuff
the
cushion
with
straw
said
she
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
which
one
was
the
more
cast
down
by
her
answers
the
man
or
the
woman
but
the
old
woman
made
haste
to
take
the
bag
of
feathers
out
of
her
basket
and
give
it
to
them
a
feather
cushion
is
fit
for
a
king
she
said
and
as
for
me
an
apple
for
a
dumpling
or
a
nosegay
from
your
garden
will
serve
me
as
well
as
what
i
give
the
man
and
the
woman
had
no
apples
but
they
were
glad
to
exchange
a
nosegay
from
their
garden
for
a
bag
of
fine
feathers
you
may
be
sure
there
is
nothing
nicer
for
a
cushion
than
feathers
said
the
woman
my
mother
had
one
made
of
them
said
the
man
and
they
laughed
like
children
as
they
hurried
into
the
garden
to
fill
the
old
basket
with
the
loveliest
posies
lilies
lilacs
violets
roses
oh
never
was
there
a
sweeter
nosegay
a
good
bargain
and
not
all
of
it
in
the
basket
said
the
old
woman
for
she
was
pleased
to
have
stopped
the
quarrel
and
when
she
had
wished
the
two
good
fortune
and
a
long
life
she
went
upon
her
way
again
now
her
way
was
the
king
highway
and
as
she
walked
there
she
met
a
young
lord
who
was
dressed
in
his
finest
clothes
for
he
was
going
to
see
his
lady
love
he
would
have
been
as
handsome
a
young
man
as
ever
the
sun
shone
on
had
it
not
been
that
his
forehead
was
wrinkled
into
a
terrible
frown
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drawn
down
as
if
he
had
not
a
friend
left
in
the
whole
world
a
fair
day
and
a
good
road
said
the
old
woman
stopping
to
drop
him
a
courtesy
fair
or
foul
good
or
bad
is
all
one
to
me
said
he
when
the
court
jeweler
has
forgotten
to
send
the
ring
he
promised
and
i
must
go
to
my
lady
with
empty
hands
empty
hands
are
better
than
an
empty
heart
said
the
old
woman
but
then
we
are
young
only
once
so
you
shall
have
a
gift
for
your
lady
though
i
may
never
have
an
apple
dumpling
and
she
took
the
nosegay
from
her
basket
and
gave
it
to
the
young
lord
which
pleased
him
so
much
that
the
frown
smoothed
away
from
his
forehead
and
his
mouth
spread
itself
in
a
smile
and
he
was
as
handsome
a
young
man
as
ever
the
sun
shone
on
fair
exchange
is
no
robbery
said
he
and
he
unfastened
a
golden
chain
from
round
his
neck
and
gave
it
to
the
old
woman
and
went
away
holding
his
nosegay
with
great
care
footnote
an
old
saying
the
old
woman
was
delighted
with
this
golden
chain
i
might
buy
all
the
apples
in
the
market
and
then
have
something
to
spare
she
said
to
herself
as
she
hurried
away
toward
town
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
but
she
had
gone
no
farther
than
the
turn
of
the
road
when
she
came
upon
a
mother
and
children
standing
in
a
doorway
whose
faces
were
as
sorrowful
as
her
own
was
happy
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
as
soon
as
she
reached
them
matter
enough
answered
the
mother
when
the
last
crust
of
bread
is
eaten
and
not
a
farthing
in
the
house
to
buy
more
cried
the
old
woman
when
this
was
told
her
never
shall
it
be
said
of
me
that
i
eat
apple
dumpling
for
supper
while
my
neighbors
lack
bread
and
she
put
the
golden
chain
into
the
hands
and
hurried
on
without
waiting
for
thanks
she
was
not
out
of
sight
of
the
house
though
when
the
mother
and
children
every
one
of
them
laughing
and
talking
as
if
it
were
christmas
or
candlemas
day
overtook
her
little
have
we
to
give
you
said
the
mother
who
was
the
happiest
of
all
for
that
you
have
done
for
us
but
here
is
a
little
dog
whose
barking
will
keep
loneliness
from
your
house
and
a
blessing
goes
with
it
the
old
woman
did
not
have
the
heart
to
say
them
nay
so
into
the
basket
went
the
little
dog
and
very
snugly
he
lay
there
illustration
she
saw
an
as
full
of
apples
as
her
was
full
of
plums
a
bag
of
feathers
for
a
basket
of
plums
a
nosegay
of
flowers
for
a
bag

a
golden
chain
for
a
nosegay
of

a

a
blessing
for
a
golden
chain
all
the
world
is
give
and
take
and
who
knows
but
that
i
may
have
my
apple
yet
said
the
old
woman
as
she
hurried
on
and
sure
enough
she
had
not
gone
a
half
dozen
yards
when
right
before
her
she
saw
an
as
full
of
apples
as
her
was
full
of
plums
it
grew
in
front
of
a
house
as
much
like
her
own
as
if
the
two
were
peas
in
the
same
pod
and
on
the
porch
of
the
house
sat
a
little
old
man
a
fine
tree
of
apples
called
the
old
woman
as
soon
as
she
was
in
speaking
distance
of
him
aye
but
and
apples
are
poor
company
when
a
man
is
growing
old
said
the
old
man
and
i
would
give
them
all
if
i
had
even
so
much
as
a
little
dog
to
bark
on
my
called
the
dog
in
the
old
woman
basket
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
read
this
story
he
was
barking
on
the
old
and
the
old
woman
was
on
her
way
home
with
a
basket
of
apples
on
her
arm
she
got
there
in
plenty
of
time
to
make
the
dumpling
for
supper
and
it
was
as
sweet
and
brown
a
dumpling
as
heart
could
desire
if
you
try
long
enough
and
hard
enough
you
can
always
have
an
apple
dumpling
for
supper
said
the
old
woman
and
she
ate
the
dumpling
to
the
very
last
crumb
and
enjoyed
it
too
the
king
servant
there
was
once
upon
a
time
a
faithful
servant
whose
name
was
hans
he
served
the
king
his
master
so
long
and
so
well
that
one
day
the
king
said
to
him
speak
hans
and
tell
me
what
three
things
do
you
most
desire
that
i
may
give
them
to
you
as
a
reward
for
your
faithfulness
footnote
adapted
with
a
free
hand
from
grimm
white
snake
it
did
not
take
hans
long
to
answer
the
king
if
you
please
your
majesty
he
said
i
should
like
best
in
all
the
world
to
go
to
see
my
mother
to
have
a
horse
on
which
to
ride
upon
my
journey
and
to
taste
the
food
that
lies
hidden
in
the
silver
dish
that
comes
each
day
to
your
majesty
table
and
when
the
king
heard
this
he
made
haste
to
send
for
the
silver
dish
and
lifting
the
lid
with
his
own
hand
he
bade
hans
taste
of
the
food
inside
what
this
food
was
neither
i
nor
anybody
else
can
tell
you
but
no
sooner
had
hans
tasted
it
than
he
understood
what
everything
in
the
world
was
saying
from
the
birds
in
the
to
the
hens
in
the
king
poultry
yard
hans
they
called
as
hans
mounted
the
horse
which
the
king
gave
him
and
rode
away
through
the
gate
said
hans
and
he
cantered
off
in
fine
style
down
the
king
highway
before
he
had
ridden
far
however
he
heard
such
a
moaning
and
complaining
by
the
roadside
that
he
stopped
his
horse
to
see
what
the
matter
was
and
do
you
believe
it
it
was
the
ant
people
whose
stood
in
the
way
right
where
hans
was
about
to
ride
see
see
they
cried
running
to
and
fro
in
great
alarm
this
giant
of
a
man
on
his
terrible
horse
will
ride
over
our
new
house
and
crush
us
to
death
not
i
said
hans
if
so
much
as
one
of
you
gets
under
my
hoofs
it
will
be
your
fault
and
not
mine
and
getting
down
from
his
horse
he
led
him
around
the
and
into
the
road
on
the
other
side
one
good
turn
deserves
another
cried
the
ant
people
running
to
and
fro
in
great
joy
you
have
helped
us
and
we
will
help
you
some
day
and
they
were
still
saying
this
when
hans
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
now
before
long
hans
came
to
a
great
forest
and
as
he
rode
under
the
spreading
branches
of
the
trees
he
heard
a
cry
for
help
in
the
woods
what
can
this
be
said
hans
but
the
very
next
minute
he
saw
two
young
birds
lying
beneath
a
tree
beating
their
wings
upon
the
ground
and
crying
aloud
alas
alas
who
will
put
us
into
the
nest
again
i
the
king
servant
and
my
mother
son
i
will
put
you
into
the
nest
again
said
hans
and
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
one
good
turn
deserves
another
called
the
birds
when
they
were
safe
in
their
nest
once
more
you
have
helped
us
and
we
will
help
you
some
day
hans
laughed
to
hear
them
for
though
it
was
easy
for
him
to
help
them
he
could
not
think
what
they
might
do
for
him
trot
trot
and
gallop
gallop
he
rode
through
the
forest
till
he
came
to
a
stream
of
water
beside
which
lay
three
panting
fishes
we
shall
surely
die
unless
we
can
get
into
the
water
they
cried
their
breath
was
almost
gone
and
their
voices
were
no
louder
than
the
faintest
whisper
but
hans
understood
every
word
that
they
said
and
he
jumped
from
his
horse
and
threw
them
into
the
stream
one
good
turn
deserves
another
they
cried
as
they
swam
merrily
away
you
have
helped
us
and
we
will
help
you
some
day
now
it
so
happened
that
hans
came
by
and
by
to
the
land
of
a
very
wicked
king
who
broke
his
promises
as
easily
as
if
they
were
made
of
spun
glass
and
who
never
thought
of
anybody
but
himself
no
sooner
had
hans
come
into
the
land
than
the
king
stopped
him
and
would
not
let
him
go
on
no
one
shall
pass
through
my
kingdom
he
said
till
he
has
done
one
piece
of
work
for
me
hans
was
not
afraid
of
work
show
it
to
me
that
i
may
do
it
at
once
he
said
for
i
am
hastening
to
see
my
mother
then
the
king
took
hans
into
a
room
as
large
as
a
meadow
where
some
of
all
the
seeds
in
the
world
was
stored
there
were
and
and
grains
of
rice
fine
seeds
of
flowers
and
small
seeds
of
grass
all
mixed
and
mingled
till
no
two
alike
lay
together
hans
had
never
seen
so
many
seeds
in
all
his
life
before
and
when
he
had
looked
at
them
the
king
bade
him
sort
them
each
kind
to
itself
the
must
be
here
and
the
there
the
in
this
corner
and
the
grains
of
rice
in
another
the
fine
seeds
of
flowers
must
be
in
their
place
and
the
small
seeds
of
grass
all
ready
for
planting
before
you
can
pass
through
my
kingdom
and
go
on
your
way
he
said
and
when
he
had
spoken
he
went
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
poor
hans
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
cried
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
i
do
assure
you
for
he
said
to
himself
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
i
can
never
do
this
thing
that
the
king
requires
i
shall
never
see
my
mother
or
the
good
king
my
master
again
how
long
he
sat
there
neither
i
nor
anybody
else
can
tell
you
but
by
and
by
he
saw
a
little
black
ant
creeping
in
through
a
crack
in
the
floor
behind
it
came
another
and
another
like
soldiers
marching
one
by
one
they
came
till
the
whole
floor
was
black
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
the
ant
people
you
helped
us
and
we
have
come
to
help
you
they
said
and
they
set
to
work
at
once
to
sort
the
seed
as
the
king
required
by
the
next
day
when
the
king
came
in
to
inquire
how
hans
was
getting
on
the
work
was
done
the
was
here
and
the
was
there
the
in
one
corner
and
the
grains
of
rice
in
another
the
fine
seeds
of
flowers
were
in
their
place
and
the
small
seeds
of
grass
were
all
ready
for
planting
the
king
was
astonished
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
but
he
would
not
let
hans
go
such
a
fine
workman
must
do
one
other
piece
of
work
before
he
passes
through
my
kingdom
he
said
and
he
took
hans
out
in
the
open
country
and
pointed
to
an
orchard
far
away
bring
me
one
golden
apple
that
grows
in
that
orchard
and
you
shall
go
free
he
said
ah
what
an
easy
task
is
this
said
hans
and
he
set
off
at
once
to
the
orchard
but
alack
when
he
had
come
to
the
orchard
gate
it
was
guarded
by
a
fiery
dragon
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
in
all
his
life
come
and
be
devoured
it
cried
as
hans
came
into
sight
poor
hans
he
sat
down
by
the
roadside
and
held
his
head
between
his
hands
and
cried
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
i
do
assure
you
for
he
said
to
himself
if
i
go
into
the
orchard
i
shall
be
eaten
alive
by
the
dragon
and
if
i
do
not
go
i
shall
never
see
my
mother
or
the
good
king
my
master
again
how
long
he
sat
there
neither
i
nor
anybody
else
can
tell
you
but
by
and
by
he
saw
two
birds
flying
through
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
till
at
last
they
reached
the
spot
where
hans
sat
and
lighted
at
his
feet
and
they
were
the
very
birds
that
hans
had
helped
their
wings
had
grown
strong
enough
by
this
time
to
carry
them
wherever
they
wanted
to
go
and
they
flapped
them
joyfully
as
they
cried
one
good
turn
deserves
another
you
helped
us
and
we
have
come
to
help
you
it
was
no
trouble
for
them
to
fly
into
the
orchard
high
above
the
dragon
head
and
almost
before
hans
knew
they
were
gone
they
were
back
again
bringing
with
them
the
golden
apple
that
the
king
desired
he
was
astonished
when
hans
took
it
to
him
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
but
he
would
not
let
hans
go
instead
he
took
a
ring
from
his
finger
and
threw
it
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
sea
go
and
fetch
me
that
ring
he
said
and
you
shall
be
free
as
the
birds
and
the
bees
but
until
it
is
upon
my
finger
again
you
shall
not
pass
through
my
kingdom
poor
hans
he
sat
down
on
the
seashore
and
cried
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
i
do
assure
you
for
he
said
to
himself
who
can
do
a
task
like
this
i
must
either
drown
or
stay
here
all
the
days
of
my
life
i
shall
never
see
my
mother
or
the
good
king
my
master
again
how
long
he
sat
there
neither
i
nor
anybody
else
can
tell
you
but
by
and
by
three
little
fishes
came
swimming
to
the
shore
one
good
turn
deserves
another
they
called
for
they
were
the
very
fish
that
hans
had
thrown
into
the
stream
you
helped
us
and
we
have
come
to
help
you
then
down
they
went
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
sea
where
the
ring
lay
one
of
them
took
it
in
his
mouth
and
so
brought
it
safely
to
hans
who
ran
with
it
to
the
king
illustration
one
of
them
took
it
in
his
mouth
and
so
brought
it
safely
to
hans
and
when
the
king
saw
the
ring
he
knew
that
he
must
let
hans
go
he
did
not
dare
to
keep
him
any
longer
so
hans
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
joyfully
to
his
mother
home
where
he
stayed
till
the
time
came
when
he
must
return
to
the
good
king
his
master
which
he
did
by
another
road
he
worked
well
and
was
happy
serving
his
master
faithfully
and
making
friends
with
birds
and
beasts
all
the
days
of
his
life
but
never
again
did
he
go
to
the
wicked
king
country
and
i
for
one
think
he
showed
his
good
sense
by
that
the
great
white
bear
once
upon
a
time
the
tailor
of
wraye
and
the
tinker
of
wraye
went
to
the
king
fair
together
and
when
they
had
seen
all
the
sights
that
were
there
they
started
home
together
well
pleased
with
their
outing
the
sun
was
going
down
when
they
left
the
fair
and
when
they
came
to
the
enchanted
wood
through
which
they
had
to
pass
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
hill
and
a
fine
full
moon
it
was
so
bright
that
the
night
was
almost
as
light
as
day
there
are
some
people
who
would
not
venture
in
this
wood
at
night
even
when
the
moon
is
shining
said
the
tinker
but
as
for
me
i
do
not
know
what
fear
is
nor
i
said
the
tailor
i
would
that
every
one
had
as
stout
a
heart
as
mine
and
it
was
just
then
that
grandmother
grey
old
white
sheep
that
had
wandered
into
the
wood
that
eve
came
plodding
through
the
bushes
goodness
me
what
is
that
said
the
tinker
clutching
his
arm
a
bear
cried
the
tailor
casting
one
frightened
glance
toward
the
bushes
a
great
white
bear
run
run
for
your
life
and
run
they
did
the
tailor
was
small
and
the
tinker
was
tall
but
it
was
a
close
race
between
them
up
hill
and
down
hill
and
into
the
town
a
bear
a
great
white
bear
they
called
as
they
ran
and
everybody
they
met
took
up
the
cry
a
bear
a
bear
till
the
whole
town
was
roused
the
mayor
and
his
wife
the
shoemaker
and
his
daughter
the
butcher
the
baker
the
the
blacksmith
and
the
son
indeed
to
make
a
long
story
short
everybody
who
was
awake
in
the
town
of
wraye
came
hurrying
out
of
their
houses
to
hear
what
the
matter
was
there
was
soon
as
large
a
crowd
as
went
to
church
on
sunday
gathered
about
the
two
friends
and
the
tailor
and
the
tinker
talked
as
fast
as
they
had
run
to
tell
their
thrilling
tale
we
were
just
coming
through
the
wood
said
the
tailor
when
there
as
close
to
us
as
the
shoemaker
is
to
the
blacksmith
we
saw
a
terrible
creature
interrupted
the
tinker
is
as
large
as
a
calf
i
assure
you
and
white
as
the
mayor
shirt
cried
the
tailor
it
is
a
marvel
that
we
escaped
and
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
i
saw
it
first
said
the
tinker
but
i
stood
my
ground
i
did
not
run
till
the
tailor
did
the
two
would
have
been
willing
to
talk
till
morning
had
not
all
the
others
determined
to
go
to
the
wood
at
once
and
kill
the
bear

a
bear
cried
the
tailor
i
can
not
answer
for
the
safety
of
the
town
till
it
is
done
said
the
mayor
so
every
one
ran
for
a
weapon
as
fast
as
his
feet
could
carry
him
the
mayor
brought
his
long
sword
that
the
king
had
given
him
and
the
carpenter
a
hatchet
the
blacksmith
took
his
hammer
and
the
son
a
gun
and
the
rest
of
the
men
whatever
they
could
put
their
hands
on
the
women
went
too
with
mops
and
brooms
to
drive
the
bear
away
should
he
run
toward
the
town
and
one
little
boy
who
had
waked
up
in
the
stir
followed
after
them
with
stones
in
his
hands
they
very
soon
came
to
the
wood
and
then
the
question
was
who
should
go
first
let
the
tinker
and
the
tailor
lead
the
way
said
the
mayor
and
we
will
come
close
after
oh
no
if
you
please
your
honor
said
the
tinker
and
the
tailor
speaking
at
the
very
same
time
that
will
never
do
we
can
not
think
of
going
before
you
i
will
go
first
if
the
mayor
will
lend
me
his
sword
said
the
shoemaker
aye

let
the
shoemaker
go
cried
some
no

the
king
gave
the
sword
to
him
said
others
i
could
kill
the
bear
while
you
are
talking
about
it
said
the
miller
son
every
one
had
something
to
say
but
at
last
it
was
all
settled
and
the
miller
son
with
the
mayor
sword
by
his
side
and
his
own
gun
in
his
hand
was
just
slipping
into
the
wood
when
out
walked
the
old
white
sheep
baa

she
cried
as
if
to
ask
pray
tell
me
what
the
about
baa

a
sheep

great
white
sheep
cried
the
miller
son
and
then
how
the
people
of
wraye
did
laugh
they
laughed
and
they
laughed
and
they
laughed
so
loud
and
so
long
that
their
laughter
was
heard
all
the
way
to
the
king
fair
and
set
the
people
to
laughing
there
but
whether
the
tailor
and
the
tinker
laughed
or
not
i
do
not
know
the
song
that
traveled
one
day
when
all
the
world
was
gay
with
spring
a
king
stood
at
a
window
of
his
palace
and
looked
far
out
over
his
kingdom
and
because
his
land
was
fair
to
see
and
he
was
a
young
king
and
his
heart
was
happy
he
made
a
song
for
himself
and
sang
it
loud
and
merrily
the
hawthorn
white
the
sun
is
bright
and
blue
the
cloudless
sky
and
not
a
bird
that
sings
in
spring
is
happier
than
i
than
i
is
happier
than
i
now
it
chanced
that
a
ploughboy
at
work
in
a
field
hard
by
the
palace
heard
the
king
song
and
caught
the
words
and
the
air
of
it
he
was
young
and
happy
and
as
he
followed
his
plough
across
the
dewy
field
and
thought
of
the
corn
that
would
grow
by
and
by
in
the
furrows
it
made
and
of
his
little
black
and
white
pig
that
would
feed
and
grow
fat
on
the
corn
he
sang
the
hawthorn
white
the
sun
is
bright
and
blue
the
cloudless
sky
and
not
a
bird
that
sings
in
spring
is
happier
than
i
than
i
is
happier
than
i
a
right
merry
song
robin
ploughboy
called
the
who
tended
the
farmer
geese
in
the
next
field
and
she
leaned
on
the
fence
that
divided
the
two
and
sang
with
him
for
she
was
as
happy
a
lass
as
ever
lived
in
the
king
country
the
farmer
wife
had
given
her
a
goose
for
her
very
own
that
day
and
the
goose
had
made
a
nest
in
the
alder
bushes
there
was
already
one
egg
in
it
and
soon
there
would
be
more
then
she
would
send
them
to
market
and
when
they
were
sold
she
would
buy
a
ribbon
for
her
hair
it
was
no
wonder
that
she
felt
like
singing
the
hawthorn
white
the
sun
is
bright
and
blue
the
cloudless
sky
and
not
a
bird
that
sings
in

happier
than

the
chapman
from
whom
she
bought
her
ribbon
in
all
good
time
learned
the
king
song
from
her
and
as
he
trudged
along
the
highway
with
his
pack
upon
his
back
he
too
sang
it
for
there
is
no
better
weather
for
peddling
or
singing
either
than
that
which
comes
in
the
spring
footnote
a
peddler
a
soldier
just
home
from
the
wars
and
glad
enough
to
be
there
had
the
song
from
the
chapman
and
in
turn
he
taught
it
to
a
sailor
who
took
it
to
sea
with
him
the
sailor
was
going
to
the
far
countries
but
if
all
went
well
with
his
ship
and
with
him
he
would
be
at
home
in
time
to
see
the
hawthorn
bloom
in
his
mother
yard
another
year
and
another
spring
illustration
she
leaned
on
the
fence
that
divided
the
two
he
kept
the
song
in
his
heart
for
a
year
and
a
day
and
then
because
nothing
had
gone
amiss
and
he
was
homeward
bound
he
sang
it
too
the
hawthorn
white
the
sun
is
bright
and

on
the
sailor
ship
there
was
a
minstrel
bound
for
the
king
court
to
sing
on
may
day
and
the
minstrel
learned
the
song
from
the
sailor
he
was
a
young
minstrel
and
very
proud
to
sing
at
the
king
festival
so
when
it
was
his
turn
and
he
stood
before
the
throne
he
could
think
of
no
better
song
to
sing
than
the
hawthorn

bright

the
king
had
been
so
busy
about
the
affairs
of
his
kingdom
deciding
this
question
and
that
sending
messengers
here
and
there
and
listening
to
one
and
another
as
all
kings
must
do
that
he
had
forgotten
the
song
which
he
had
made
but
when
he
heard
the
minstrel
it
all
came
back
to
him
and
then
he
was
puzzled
good
minstrel
said
he
ten
golden
guineas
i
will
give
you
for
your
song
and
to
the
ten
will
add
ten
more
if
you
will
tell
me

you
learned
it

matter

rides
in

ship
in

harbor

it
to
me
the
soldier

even
now

when
he
was

i
had
it
from

travels

him
about
it

king
sang
it
first
and
i
next
said
the
ploughboy
then
the
king
knew
that
he
had
made
a
good
song
that
everybody
with
a
happy
heart
might
sing
and
because
he
was
glad
of
this

at

i
am
indebted
to
one
william
shakespeare
whose
intimate
acquaintance
with
fairyland
none
can
dispute
for
the
name
to
joseph
rodman
drake
for
the
idea
of
my
story
and
to
some
of
the
folk
tales
which
suggested
to
me
one
or
two
of
adventures
in
the
deepest
dell
of
the
enchanted
wood
where
the
moss
grew
the
greenest
and
the
violets
bloomed
the
sweetest
the
fairies
lived
it
was
they
who
kept
the
brooks
and
the
springs
free
from
dirt
or
clog
and
tended
the
wild
flowers
and
watched
over
the
young
trees
and
they
were
friends
with
all
the
harmless
birds
and
beasts
from
wood
end
to
wood
end
but
for
those
creatures
that
work
harm
to
others
and
for
the
goblins
who
delight
in
mischief
they
had
no
love
and
every
day
and
every
night
a
watch
was
set
to
drive
them
from
the
fairy
dell
each
fay
in
turn
kept
guard
and
all
went
well
till
one
evening
when
the
fairy
in
the
dell
fell
asleep
at
his
post
and
the
goblins
stole
away
the
nightingale
that
sang
each
night
at
the
queen
court
great
was
the
sorrow
in
fairyland
when
this
was
known
i
will
fly
to
catch
them
before
they
have
had
time
to
hide
her
away
cried
a
fay
whose
name
was
i
will
go
too
said
little
and
i
three
said
and
my
good
thorn
sword
with
me
which
will
make
four
against
them
but
the
fairy
queen
would
not
consent
to
this
in
his
trust
did
fail
and
he
must
seek
the
nightingale
she
said
and
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
than
the
little
fay
bade
his
companions
and
hastened
out
upon
his
quest
alone
the
goblins
had
left
no
trace
behind
them
and
wandered
hither
and
thither
over
dewy
fells
and
fields
asking
of
every
piping
cricket
and
brown
winged
bat
he
met
passed
the
goblins
this
way
no
one
could
aid
him
and
he
was
ready
to
drop
from
weariness
and
sorrow
when
the
moon
came
over
the
hill
and
called
whither
away
whither
away
in
quest
of
the
nightingale
that
the
goblins
have
stolen
but
where
they
have
taken
her
i
can
not
find
answered
the
little
fay
sadly
then
said
the
moon
many
a
nightingale
there
is
in
the
wide
world
both
free
and
caged
and
how
may
i
know
yours
from
any
other
but
this
i
can
tell
you
through
a
window
in
the
castle
of
the
great
giant
which
stands
upon
a
high
hill
beside
the
silver
sea
i
spy
a
nightingale
in
a
golden
cage
which
was
not
there
when
i
shone
through
that
same
window
yester
eve
and
moreover
at
the
world
end
which
is
beyond
the
giant
castle
i
see
a
band
of
goblins
counting
money
a
thousand
thanks
to
you
oh
moon
cried
joyfully
when
he
heard
this
for
he
could
put
two
and
two
together
as
well
as
any
fay
in
fairyland
and
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
goblins
had
sold
the
nightingale
to
the
great
giant
i
shall
be
at
the
castle
before
you
shine
in
the
dell
he
called
to
the
moon
as
he
flew
swift
as
a
humming
bird
through
the
air
but
when
he
reached
the
hedge
of
thorns
that
guarded
the
palace
of
a
lovely
princess
who
was
next
neighbor
to
the
giant
he
tripped
against
a
that
was
hurrying
to
an
illumination
in
the
palace
and
tumbled
headlong
into
the
thorns
help
help
he
cried
as
he
struggled
to
get
free
and
a
that
was
out
in
a
search
of
a
supper
flew
down
to
see
what
the
matter
was
oh
ho
said
he
when
he
saw
who
it
was
fairy
folk
like
to
have
all
things
their
way
but
is
my
turn
now
to
have
a
little
fun
and
he
plucked
from
out
the
thorns
and
flew
away
with
him
in
his
bill
up
and
down
so
high
that
the
trees
below
looked
no
taller
than
corn
stalks
and
so
low
that
their
branches
brushed
his
wings
he
flew
till
was
faint
from
dizziness
see
what
a
great
moth
the
hawk
has
in
his
bill
cried
an
owl
that
they
passed
is
no
moth
but
a
bug
said
a
such
an
enormous
gnat
should
make
a
meal
for
two
whispered
a
brother
hawk
flying
close
simpleton
do
you
not
know
a
fairy
when
you
see
one
said
the
who
could
keep
quiet
no
longer
but
no
sooner
had
he
opened
his
bill
to
speak
his
very
first
word
than
out
tumbled
the
other
hawk
made
haste
to
catch
the
fay
but
before
he
could
reach
him
a
fine
breeze
came
blowing
by
is
this
not
my
little
playmate
who
likes
so
well
to
ride
on
the
grasses
and
rock
in
the
flowers
asked
the
breeze
and
it
whisked
the
little
fairy
away
and
bore
him
along
so
fast
that
no
bird
could
keep
up
with
him
they
were
at
the
silver
sea
in
the
twinkling
of
a
star
and
was
just
beginning
to
think
that
his
troubles
were
ended
when
the
breeze
died
away
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
and
the
little
fay
found
himself
in
the
sea
before
he
knew
what
was
happening
fortunately
for
him
a
great
tarpon
fish
came
swimming
by
just
then
catch
fast
hold
of
my
tail
and
i
will
take
you
safely
to
shore
said
he
and
lost
no
time
in
doing
as
he
was
bid
ugh
how
salty
the
water
was
and
how
the
billows
roared
as
the
fish
plunged
through
them
sending
the
white
spray
far
above
his
head
poor
was
more
dead
than
alive
when
they
reached
the
shore
but
as
soon
as
he
had
gotten
his
breath
again
he
said
to
his
new
friend
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
fairyland
you
may
swim
in
a
stream
as
clear
as
glass
there
is
no
salt
in
it
and
no
rough
waves
and
every
fairy
in
the
dell
will
guard
you
from
harm
water
without
salt
i
can
not
imagine
it
said
the
great
tarpon
and
no
waves
why
i
should
die
of
homesickness
there
so
when
saw
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
for
him
he
thanked
him
kindly
and
turned
his
steps
to
the
giant
castle
which
stood
on
a
high
hill
close
beside
the
sea
just
as
the
moon
had
said
but
wings
were
so
wet
and
so
weary
that
though
he
tried
once
twice
and
thrice
he
could
not
fly
to
the
lowest
window
ledge
of
the
castle
and
what
he
would
have
done
nobody
knows
had
not
a
who
was
out
late
from
home
flown
by
just
then
she
lived
in
the
castle
chimney
and
when
she
heard
what
the
little
fay
wanted
she
offered
to
carry
him
to
her
nest
once
there
all
will
be
easy
she
said
for
there
is
no
better
way
to
get
into
the
castle
than
through
the
chimney
so
seated
himself
between
the
swift
wings
and
up
they
went
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
and
then
down
through
the
opening
to
the
swift
home
which
looked
as
if
it
were
only
half
of
a
nest
fastened
against
the
wall
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
fairyland
said
when
he
saw
this
you
shall
have
the
greenest
tree
in
the
wood
for
your
home
and
the
fairies
will
help
you
to
build
a
whole
nest
there
but
the
swift
only
laughed
at
him
there
is
no
better
place
than
a
chimney
to
raise
young
birds
i
should
be
uneasy
about
them
every
minute
in
a
tree
and
as
for
a
whole
nest
i
do
know
what
you
mean
said
she
and
when
saw
that
she
was
well
content
with
her
home
he
thanked
her
and
bade
her
and
began
his
climb
down
the
chimney
there
was
no
light
to
show
him
the
way
except
the
little
that
the
moon
sent
through
the
opening
high
above
the
swift
nest
and
on
all
sides
of
the
little
fay
were
the
straight
narrow
walls
of
the
chimney
covered
with
black
soot
he
clung
to
them
as
closely
as
a
lichen
to
a
rock
putting
his
little
toes
into
every
crack
and
holding
fast
to
the
bits
of
cement
that
jutted
out
here
and
there
from
the
bricks
if
he
rustled
a
wing
he
brought
down
a
shower
of
soot
upon
himself
and
when
at
last
he
stood
in
the
giant
room
he
was
as
black
as
any
goblin
he
had
no
time
to
think
of
himself
though
for
there
asleep
in
the
golden
cage
which
the
moon
had
seen
was
the
queen
nightingale
there
was
no
mistaking
her
for
there
was
a
tiny
feather
missing
from
the
tip
of
her
right
wing
and
that
missing
feather
was
in
sunday
cap
hanging
in
an
alder
bush
in
the
fairy
dell
that
very
minute
the
giant
was
asleep
too
but
the
golden
cage
was
on
a
table
close
beside
him
so
close
that
poor
whose
wings
were
not
improved
by
the
soot
from
the
chimney
could
not
reach
it
without
climbing
upon
the
giant
bed
he
was
as
careful
as
he
could
be
but
no
sooner
had
he
stepped
upon
the
bed
than
he
touched
one
of
the
giant
toes
and
the
giant
gave
a
great
start
what
is
the
matter
called
his
wife
oh
nothing
said
he
i
only
dreamed
that
a
little
mouse
was
tickling
my
toes
and
he
fell
asleep
again
did
not
dare
to
move
till
he
heard
him
breathing
heavily
then
tiptoe
across
the
counterpane
he
went
taking
care
at
every
step
but
in
spite
of
his
care
his
wings
brushed
against
one
of
the
giant
hands
and
the
giant
gave
a
great
start
what
is
the
matter
called
his
wife
oh
nothing
said
he
i
only
dreamed
that
a
little
leaf
fell
on
my
hand
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
over
on
his
side
and
was
soon
asleep
was
close
under
the
cage
by
this
time
but
so
tall
was
the
table
on
which
it
was
and
so
small
was
he
that
to
reach
the
door
he
was
forced
to
stand
on
the
giant
head
light
as
were
his
feet
but
no
sooner
had
the
giant
felt
their
tread
than
he
gave
a
great
start
and
lifting
his
hand
struck
himself
a
tremendous
blow
upon
his
forehead
would
have
been
crushed
to
death
had
he
not
managed
to
spring
just
at
that
instant
to
the
edge
of
the
cage
where
he
stood
trembling
what
is
the
matter
called
the
giant
wife
oh
nothing
said
he
i
only
dreamed
that
a
fly
lighted
on
my
forehead
and
he
was
soon
breathing
heavily
again
the
nightingale
who
was
not
used
to
sleeping
at
night
anyway
was
wide
awake
by
this
time
but
when
she
saw
she
did
not
know
him
so
black
was
he
do
you
not
remember
the
fairy
dell
and
the
little
fay
to
whom
you
gave
a
feather
for
his
cap
said
then
and
when
the
nightingale
heard
that
she
was
so
overjoyed
that
she
could
scarcely
keep
from
bursting
into
song
to
open
the
cage
door
was
only
a
minute
work
and
the
nightingale
was
soon
as
free
as
air
seated
himself
upon
her
back
and
she
was
just
ready
to
fly
through
an
open
window
near
by
when
the
giant
waked
up
in
real
earnest
and
saw
the
open
cage
thieves
robbers
he
called
in
such
a
terrible
voice
that
the
shook
in
her
nest
and
the
big
fish
in
the
silver
sea
jumped
out
of
the
water
if
the
giant
had
spied
and
the
nightingale
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
them
but
luckily
for
them
his
wife
who
was
a
woman
saw
them
before
he
did
and
upset
the
golden
cage
right
in
his
way
illustration
straight
to
the
enchanted
wood
they
went
the
whole
place
is
bewitched
thundered
he
stumbling
over
the
cage
and
in
the
stir
which
followed
the
nightingale
slipped
away
unseen
over
the
silver
sea
where
the
fish
swam
over
the
hedge
of
thorns
which
guarded
the
palace
of
the
lovely
princess
over
the
fields
and
the
fells
where
the
dew
sparkled
straight
to
the
enchanted
wood
they
went
who
comes
here
called
the
fairy
warder
of
the
dell
and
the
nightingale
answered
the
fay
and
great
was
the
joy
in
fairyland
at
their
return
how
long
you
have
been
said
how
fast
you
have
come
said
little
but
as
for
he
could
not
speak
at
all
for
laughing
at
sooty
then
made
haste
to
bathe
himself
in
the
brook
and
put
on
his
finest
court
suit
of
pink
satin
trimmed
with
lace
from
a
spider
web
for
the
fairy
queen
had
ordered
a
grand
court
ball
in
his
honor
and
there
was
no
time
to
lose
a
cricket
band
played
merrily
the
nightingale
sang
from
a
thicket
close
at
hand
and
tripping
and
twirling
the
little
folks
went
till
the
cock
crowed
and
the
sun
came
up
and
it
was
fairy
bedtime
in
light
of
sun
and
light
of
moon
how
different
all
things
seem
oh
wake
up
wake
up
dear
sleepy
head
was
nothing
but
a
dream
oh
but
who
can
tell
some
other
night
when
mellow
shines
the
moon
oh
perhaps
we
dream
the
dream
again
and
may
that
night
come
soon
oh
the
magic
flower
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
wee
woman
whose
bit
of
a
garden
was
a
delight
to
all
eyes
such
flowers
as
she
had
and
in
the
midst
of
them
green
as
an
emerald
and
smooth
as
velvet
was
a
grass
plot
with
never
a
weed
upon
it
and
through
the
grass
ran
a
garden
walk
as
white
as
snow
every
one
who
saw
it
declared
there
was
no
prettier
garden
in
the
king
country
and
what
they
said
was
no
more
than
what
was
true
early
and
late
the
wee
woman
worked
to
keep
her
garden
fair
and
lovely
but
in
spite
of
all
her
care
whenever
the
east
wind
blew
it
brought
with
it
a
whirl
of
trash
from
her
neighbor
dooryard
and
scattered
it
among
her
flowers
alack
and
alas
what
a
dooryard
was
that
except
for
the
trash
that
was
always
upon
it
it
was
as
bare
as
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
there
was
a
heap
of
dirt
and
ashes
as
high
as
a
hillock
in
front
of
the
door
everybody
who
passed
it
turned
their
eyes
away
from
it
for
there
was
no
uglier
spot
in
the
king
country
and
that
is
nothing
but
the
truth
of
it
whenever
the
wee
woman
looked
from
her
windows
or
walked
in
her
garden
she
saw
the
dooryard
and
many
was
the
day
when
she
said
to
herself
i
wish
i
were
a
thousand
miles
away
from
it
and
if
she
made
up
her
mind
as
sometimes
she
did
that
she
would
trouble
no
more
about
it
the
east
wind
was
sure
to
come
with
a
whirl
of
its
trash
oh
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
always
cleaning
because
of
that
dooryard
and
what
to
do
about
it
she
did
not
know
she
puzzled
and
planned
she
wished
and
she
worked
but
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
wits
when
one
day
her
fairy
godmother
came
to
see
her
never
fret
said
the
godmother
when
she
had
heard
the
trouble
in
your
own
garden
grows
a
magic
flower
that
can
set
things
right
and
if
you
will
only
tend
it
and
watch
it
and
wait
long
enough
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
and
when
she
had
pointed
out
the
flower
she
went
on
her
way
leaving
the
wee
woman
much
comforted
she
tended
the
flower
and
watched
it
and
waited
to
see
what
she
should
see
and
while
she
was
watching
and
waiting
the
flower
burst
into
bloom
the
loveliest
bloom
every
blossom
was
as
rosy
as
the
little
clouds
at
sunrise
and
the
wee
woman
garden
was
more
beautiful
than
before
because
of
them
is
the
prettiest
garden
in
the
king
country
said
every
one
who
passed
and
what
they
said
was
no
more
than
what
was
true
but
as
for
the
neighbor
dooryard
it
was
as
bare
and
ugly
as
ever
the
heap
of
dirt
and
ashes
grew
larger
every
day
and
whenever
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
it
brought
a
whirl
of
its
trash
into
the
wee
woman
garden
just
as
it
had
always
done
the
wee
woman
looked
each
morning
to
see
if
the
magic
of
the
flower
had
begun
to
work
but
morning
after
morning
nothing
changed
it
is
long
waiting
and
weary
watching
for
magic
things
to
work
said
she
to
herself
but
because
of
what
her
fairy
godmother
had
told
her
she
tended
the
flower
from
day
to
day
and
hoped
in
her
heart
that
something
might
come
of
it
yet
by
and
by
the
blossoms
of
the
flower
faded
and
fell
and
after
them
came
the
seed
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
feathery
seed
there
were
and
one
day
the
wind
from
the
west
came
by
and
blew
them
away
in
a
whirl
over
the
fence
and
into
the
neighbor
dooryard
no
one
saw
them
go
not
even
the
wee
woman
knew
what
had
become
of
them
and
as
for
the
dooryard
it
was
as
ugly
as
ever
with
its
ash
heap
and
its
trash
everybody
who
passed
it
turned
their
eyes
away
from
it
illustration
while
she
was
watching
and
waiting
the
flower
burst
into
bloom
the
wee
woman
herself
would
look
at
it
no
longer
i
will
look
at
the
magic
flower
instead
she
said
to
herself
and
so
she
did
early
and
late
she
tended
the
plant
and
worked
to
make
her
garden
fair
and
lovely
but
she
kept
her
eyes
from
the
dooryard
and
if
the
wind
from
the
east
blew
trash
among
her
flowers
she
raked
it
away
and
burned
it
up
and
troubled
no
more
about
it
summer
slipped
into
autumn
and
autumn
to
winter
and
the
flowers
slept
but
at
the
first
peep
of
spring
the
wee
woman
garden
budded
and
bloomed
once
more
and
one
day
as
she
worked
there
with
her
back
to
the
dooryard
she
heard
call
out
in
delight
of
all
the
gardens
in
the
king
country
there
are
none
so
pretty
as
these
two
and
when
she
looked
around
in
surprise
to
see
what
they
meant
she
saw
that
the
neighbor
dooryard
was
full
of
flowers
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
lovely
blossoms
every
one
as
rosy
as
the
little
clouds
at
sunrise
they
covered
the
heap
of
dirt
and
ashes
they
clustered
about
the
door
stone
they
filled
the
corners
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
the
neighbor
raking
and
cleaning
as
busily
as
if
she
were
the
wee
woman
herself
is
fine
weather
for
flowers
said
she
nodding
and
smiling
at
the
wee
woman
the
finest
in
the
world
said
the
wee
woman
and
she
nodded
and
smiled
too
for
she
knew
that
the
magic
flower
had
done
its
work
the
lions
in
the
way
once
upon
a
time
three
friends
set
out
to
go
to
the
palace
of
the
king
which
was
known
as
the
house
beautiful
footnote
founded
upon
the
incident
of
the
lions
in
the
way
in
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
the
king
himself
had
invited
them
there
and
that
they
might
have
no
trouble
in
finding
the
way
he
sent
to
them
a
scroll
upon
which
the
path
was
marked
so
plainly
that
it
would
have
been
a
hard
matter
to
have
missed
it
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
he
wrote
upon
the
scroll
with
his
own
hand
bidding
them
to
keep
to
the
path
turn
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
his
message
said
but
follow
the
path
and
it
will
lead
you
safely
to
the
house
beautiful
where
i
have
prepared
a
place
for
you
all
their
lives
the
three
friends
had
heard
of
the
wonders
of
the
king
house
some
people
said
that
it
was
built
of
gold
bright
as
the
sun
itself
and
others
that
it
was
made
of
gleaming
pearl
its
windows
were
said
to
overlook
the
whole
world
and
its
towers
to
reach
higher
than
the
sky
and
every
one
agreed
that
there
was
naught
within
its
gates
but
peace
and
joy
so
eager
were
the
friends
to
see
it
that
they
could
not
journey
fast
enough
to
satisfy
themselves
and
from
morning
until
night
they
urged
each
other
on
the
path
by
which
they
were
to
go
was
a
narrow
path
with
a
rough
place
now
and
then
and
now
and
then
a
briar
or
sharp
stone
upon
it
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
pleasant
way
the
travelers
hastened
joyfully
along
it
and
all
went
well
with
them
until
one
day
they
met
a
man
whose
face
was
turned
toward
the
land
from
which
they
had
just
come
good
neighbors
he
cried
why
travel
you
so
fast
is
a
house
afire
or
a
friend
ill
or
does
a
feast
wait
till
you
come
tell
me
i
pray
you
that
i
may
sorrow
with
you
or
rejoice
as
your
need
may
be
rejoice
rejoice
cried
the
three
for
we
journey
to
the
house
beautiful
where
a
place
is
prepared
for
us
but
when
the
man
heard
this
he
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
as
if
what
they
told
him
was
grievous
news
indeed
i
too
had
thought
of
going
there
he
said
but
that
was
before
i
knew
of
the
lions
in
the
way
lions
in
the
way
cried
the
travelers
looking
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
aye
lions
repeated
the
man
solemnly
the
fiercest
and
largest
that
ever
man
saw
their
very
roaring
shakes
the
ground
and
many
a
traveler
has
been
devoured
by
them
so
people
say
as
for
myself
i
have
not
seen
them
to
hear
of
them
is
enough
for
me
and
for
me
said
one
of
the
travelers
and
in
spite
of
all
his
companions
might
do
or
say
to
persuade
him
he
would
go
no
farther
the
king
house
may
be
beautiful
as
the
morning
and
as
full
of
wonders
as
the
sky
is
full
of
stars
but
what
good
will
it
be
to
me
if
i
am
eaten
by
the
lions
said
he
and
his
friends
were
forced
to
journey
on
without
him
as
they
went
they
talked
of
the
lions
in
the
way
and
the
one
said
to
the
other
think
you
it
is
true
or
but
an
idle
tale
true
or
not
we
shall
pass
in
safety
have
we
not
the
king
own
word
for
it
said
the
other
and
he
led
the
way
with
such
great
strides
that
his
friend
could
scarcely
keep
pace
with
him
on
and
on
they
traveled
without
stop
or
hindrance
till
all
at
once
the
air
was
filled
with
a
great
noise
that
shook
the
earth
beneath
their
feet
and
set
their
knees
to
trembling
there
was
no
mistaking
what
it
was
even
though
they
had
never
heard
the
sound
before
they
knew
it
was
the
roaring
of
the
lions
and
the
second
traveler
began
to
grow
afraid
let
us
go
around
by
another
way
he
said
surely
there
are
more
paths
than
one
to
the
king
house
and
though
the
other
spread
out
before
him
the
scroll
on
which
the
path
was
marked
and
read
once
more
the
message
of
the
king
turn
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
follow
the
path
and
it
will
lead
you
safely
to
the
house
beautiful
where
a
place
is
prepared
for
you
he
would
pay
no
heed
to
it
but
turned
away
into
a
and
followed
it
out
of
sight
the
other
traveler
was
forced
to
journey
on
the
path
alone
with
the
roaring
of
the
lions
in
his
ears
and
the
shaking
of
the
earth
beneath
his
feet
nor
had
he
gone
a
furlong
more
when
just
ahead
he
spied
the
lions
themselves
one
on
each
side
of
the
path
they
stood
with
flaming
eyes
and
yawning
mouths
and
at
the
very
sight
of
them
the
heart
beat
quick
and
sharp
and
his
feet
faltered
upon
the
way
but
his
faith
in
the
king
word
was
greater
than
his
fear
falter
not
oh
feet
fear
not
oh
heart
there
is
safety
in
the
path
the
king
himself
has
said
it
he
cried
as
he
pressed
on
and
lo
and
behold
when
he
had
come
to
the
lions
he
found
that
they
were
chained
roar
as
they
might
and
strive
as
they
would
they
could
not
touch
those
who
walked
in
the
path
that
the
king
had
marked
and
the
traveler
passed
in
safety
illustration
when
he
had
come
to
the
lions
he
found
that
they
were
chained
beyond
the
lions
stood
the
house
beautiful
with
walls
of
gold
bright
as
the
sun
itself
and
gates
of
gleaming
pearl
its
windows
overlooked
the
world
its
towers
reached
above
the
sky
and
of
its
wonders
not
the
half
had
ever
been
told
him
the
traveler
place
was
prepared
for
him
and
the
king
was
waiting
to
welcome
him
to
his
house
and
he
lived
there
in
peace
and
joy
forever
after
the
end
