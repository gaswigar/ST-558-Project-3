this
book
does
not
demand
continuous
reading
but
at
whatever
place
one
opens
it
one
will
find
matter
for
reflection
the
most
useful
books
are
those
of
which
readers
themselves
compose
half
they
extend
the
thoughts
of
which
the
germ
is
presented
to
them
they
correct
what
seems
defective
to
them
and
they
fortify
by
their
reflections
what
seems
to
them
weak
it
is
only
really
by
enlightened
people
that
this
book
can
be
read
the
ordinary
man
is
not
made
for
such
knowledge
philosophy
will
never
be
his
lot
those
who
say
that
there
are
truths
which
must
be
hidden
from
the
people
need
not
be
alarmed
the
people
do
not
read
they
work
six
days
of
the
week

on
the
seventh
go

inn
in
a
word
philosophical
works
are
made
only
for
philosophers
and
every
honest
man
must
try
to
be
a
philosopher
without
pluming
himself
on
being
one
this
alphabet
is
extracted
from
the
most
estimable
works
which
are
not
commonly
within
the
reach
of
the
many
and
if
the
author
does
not
always
mention
the
sources
of
his
information
as
being
well
enough
known
to
the
learned
he
must
not
be
suspected
of
wishing
to
take
the
credit
for
other
people
work
because
he
himself
preserves
anonymity

note
on
a
magistrate
written
about
a
senior
magistrate
of
a
french
town
had
the
misfortune
to
have
a
wife
who
was
debauched
by
a
priest
before
her
marriage
and
who
since
covered
herself
with
disgrace
by
public
scandals
he
was
so
moderate
as
to
leave
her
without
noise
this
man
about
forty
years
old
vigorous
and
of
agreeable
appearance
needs
a
woman
he
is
too
scrupulous
to
seek
to
seduce
another
man
wife
he
fears
intercourse
with
a
public
woman
or
with
a
widow
who
would
serve
him
as
concubine
in
this
disquieting
and
sad
state
he
addresses
to
his
church
a
plea
of
which
the
following
is
a
précis
my
wife
is
criminal
and
it
is
i
who
am
punished
another
woman
is
necessary
as
a
comfort
to
my
life
to
my
virtue
even
and
the
sect
of
which
i
am
a
member
refuses
her
to
me
it
forbids
me
to
marry
an
honest
girl
the
civil
laws
of
unfortunately
founded
on
canon
law
deprive
me
of
the
rights
of
humanity
the
church
reduces
me
to
seeking
either
the
pleasures
it
reproves
or
the
shameful
compensations
it
condemns
it
tries
to
force
me
to
be
criminal
i
cast
my
eyes
over
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
there
is
not
a
single
one
except
the
roman
catholic
people
among
whom
divorce
and
a
new
marriage
are
not
natural
rights
what
upheaval
of
the
rule
has
therefore
made
among
the
catholics
a
virtue
of
undergoing
adultery
and
a
duty
of
lacking
a
wife
when
one
has
been
infamously
outraged
by
one
own
why
is
a
bond
that
has
rotted
indissoluble
in
spite
of
the
great
law
adopted
by
the
code
ligatur
dissolubile
i
am
allowed
a
separation
mensa
et
and
i
am
not
allowed
divorce
the
law
can
deprive
me
of
my
wife
and
it
leaves
me
a
name
called
sacrament
what
a
contradiction
what
slavery
and
under
what
laws
did
we
receive
birth
what
is
still
more
strange
is
that
this
law
of
my
church
is
directly
contrary
to
the
words
which
this
church
itself
believes
to
have
been
uttered
by
jesus
christ
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
except
it
be
for
fornication
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
adultery
matt
xix
i
do
not
examine
whether
the
pontiffs
of
rome
are
in
the
right
to
violate
at
their
pleasure
the
law
of
him
they
regard
as
their
master
whether
when
a
state
has
need
of
an
heir
it
is
permissible
to
repudiate
her
who
can
give
it
one
i
do
not
inquire
if
a
turbulent
woman
demented
homicidal
a
poisoner
should
not
be
repudiated
equally
with
an
adulteress
i
limit
myself
to
the
sad
state
which
concerns
me
god
permits
me
to
remarry
and
the
bishop
of
rome
does
not
permit
me
divorce
was
a
practice
among
catholics
under
all
the
emperors
it
was
also
in
all
the
dismembered
states
of
the
roman
empire
the
kings
of
france
those
called
of
the
first
line
almost
all
repudiated
their
wives
in
order
to
take
new
ones
at
last
came
gregory
enemy
of
the
emperors
and
kings
who
by
a
decree
made
marriage
an
unshakeable
yoke
his
decretal
became
the
law
of
europe
when
the
kings
wanted
to
repudiate
a
wife
who
was
an
adulteress
according
to
jesus
christ
law
they
could
not
succeed
it
was
necessary
to
find
ridiculous
pretexts
louis
the
younger
was
obliged
to
accomplish
his
unfortunate
divorce
from
eleanor
of
guienne
to
allege
a
relationship
which
did
not
exist
henry
to
repudiate
marguerite
de
valois
pretexted
a
still
more
false
cause
a
refusal
of
consent
one
had
to
lie
to
obtain
a
divorce
legitimately
what
a
king
can
abdicate
his
crown
and
without
the
pope
permission
he
can
not
abdicate
his
wife
is
it
possible
that
otherwise
enlightened
men
have
wallowed
so
long
in
this
absurd
servitude
that
our
priests
that
our
monks
renounce
wives
to
that
i
consent
it
is
an
outrage
against
population
it
is
a
misfortune
for
them
but
they
merit
this
misfortune
which
they
have
made
for
themselves
they
have
been
the
victims
of
the
popes
who
wanted
to
have
in
them
slaves
soldiers
without
families
and
without
fatherland
living
solely
for
the
church
but
i
magistrate
who
serve
the
state
all
day
i
need
a
wife
in
the
evening
and
the
church
has
not
the
right
to
deprive
me
of
a
benefit
which
god
accords
me
the
apostles
were
married
joseph
was
married
and
i
want
to
be
if
i
alsacian
am
dependent
on
a
priest
who
dwells
at
rome
if
this
priest
has
the
barbarous
power
to
rob
me
of
a
wife
let
him
make
a
eunuch
of
me
for
the
singing
of
in
his
chapel
note
for
women
equity
demands
that
having
recorded
this
note
in
favour
of
husbands
we
should
also
put
before
the
public
the
case
in
favour
of
wives
presented
to
the
junta
of
portugal
by
a
countess
of
arcira
this
is
the
substance
of
it
the
gospel
has
forbidden
adultery
for
my
husband
just
as
for
me
he
will
be
damned
as
i
shall
nothing
is
better
established
when
he
committed
twenty
infidelities
when
he
gave
my
necklace
to
one
of
my
rivals
and
my
to
another
i
did
not
ask
the
judges
to
have
him
shaved
to
shut
him
up
among
monks
and
to
give
me
his
property
and
i
for
having
imitated
him
once
for
having
done
with
the
most
handsome
young
man
in
lisbon
what
he
did
every
day
with
impunity
with
the
most
idiotic
strumpets
of
the
court
and
the
town
have
to
answer
at
the
bar
before
licentiates
each
of
whom
would
be
at
my
feet
if
we
were
alone
together
in
my
closet
have
to
endure
at
the
court
the
usher
cutting
off
my
hair
which
is
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
and
being
shut
up
among
nuns
who
have
no
common
sense
deprived
of
my
dowry
and
my
marriage
covenants
with
all
my
property
given
to
my
coxcomb
of
a
husband
to
help
him
seduce
other
women
and
to
commit
fresh
adulteries
i
ask
if
it
is
just
and
if
it
is
not
evident
that
the
laws
were
made
by
cuckolds
in
answer
to
my
plea
i
am
told
that
i
should
be
happy
not
to
be
stoned
at
the
city
gate
by
the
canons
the
priests
of
the
parish
and
the
whole
populace
this
was
the
practice
among
the
first
nation
of
the
earth
the
chosen
nation
the
cherished
nation
the
only
one
which
was
right
when
all
the
others
were
wrong
to
these
barbarities
i
reply
that
when
the
poor
adulteress
was
presented
by
her
accusers
to
the
master
of
the
old
and
new
law
he
did
not
have
her
stoned
that
on
the
contrary
he
reproached
them
with
their
injustice
that
he
laughed
at
them
by
writing
on
the
ground
with
his
finger
that
he
quoted
the
old
hebraic
proverb
he
that
is
without
sin
among
you
let
him
first
cast
a
stone
at
her
that
then
they
all
retired
the
oldest
fleeing
first
because
the
older
they
were
the
more
adulteries
had
they
committed
the
doctors
of
canon
law
answer
me
that
this
history
of
the
adulteress
is
related
only
in
the
gospel
of
john
that
it
was
not
inserted
there
until
later
leontius
maldonat
affirm
that
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
a
single
ancient
greek
copy
that
none
of
the
early
commentators
mentions
it
origen
jerome
john
chrysostom
theophilact
nonnus
do
not
recognize
it
at
all
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
syriac
bible
it
is
not
in
ulphilas
version
that
is
what
my
husband
advocates
say
they
who
would
have
me
not
only
shaved
but
also
stoned
but
the
advocates
who
pleaded
for
me
say
that
ammonius
author
of
the
third
century
recognized
this
story
as
true
and
that
if
jerome
rejects
it
in
some
places
he
adopts
it
in
others
that
in
a
word
it
is
authentic
i
leave
there
and
i
say
to
my
husband
if
you
are
without
sin
shave
me
imprison
me
take
my
property
but
if
you
have
committed
more
sins
than
i
have
it
is
for
me
to
shave
you
to
have
you
imprisoned
and
to
seize
your
fortune
in
justice
these
things
should
be
equal
my
husband
answers
that
he
is
my
superior
and
my
chief
that
he
is
more
than
an
inch
taller
that
he
is
shaggy
as
a
bear
that
consequently
i
owe
him
everything
and
that
he
owes
me
nothing
but
i
ask
if
queen
anne
of
england
is
not
her
husband
chief
if
her
husband
the
prince
of
denmark
who
is
her
high
admiral
does
not
owe
her
entire
obedience
and
if
she
would
not
have
him
condemned
by
the
court
of
peers
if
the
little
man
infidelity
were
in
question
it
is
therefore
clear
that
if
the
women
do
not
have
the
men
punished
it
is
when
they
are
not
the
stronger
an
advocate
is
a
man
who
not
having
a
sufficient
fortune
to
buy
one
of
those
resplendent
offices
on
which
the
universe
has
its
eyes
studies
the
laws
of
theodosius
and
justinian
for
three
years
so
that
he
may
learn
the
usages
of
paris
and
who
finally
being
registered
has
the
right
to
plead
causes
for
money
if
he
have
a
strong
voice
and
the
great
dispute
between
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
is
not
yet
settled
it
has
been
on
the
table
since
the
silver
age
succeeded
the
golden
age
mankind
has
always
maintained
that
the
good
old
times
were
much
better
than

present

he
has

prejudice
with

much

as

in

liv
must

then
he
says
be
like
our

of
which
the
oldest
are
always

the
learned
and
ingenious
fontenelle
expresses
himself
on
this
subject
as
follows
the
whole
question
of
the
between
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
once
it
is
well
understood
is
reduced
to
knowing
whether
the
trees
which
formerly
were
in
our
countryside
were
bigger
than
those
of
in
the
event
that
they
were
homer
plato
demosthenes
can
not
be
equalled
in
these
latter
centuries
let
us
throw
light
on
this
paradox
if
the
ancients
had
more
intellect
than
us
it
is
that
the
brains
of
those
times
were
better
ordered
formed
of
firmer
or
more
delicate
fibres
filled
with
more
animal
spirits
but
in
virtue
of
what
were
the
brains
of
those
times
better
ordered
the
trees
also
would
have
been
bigger
and
more
beautiful
for
if
nature
was
then
younger
and
more
vigorous
the
trees
as
well
as
men
brains
would
have
been
conscious
of
this
vigour
and
this
youth
digression
on
the
ancients
and
the
moderns
vol
edition
with
the
illustrious
academician
permission
that
is
not
at
all
the
state
of
the
question
it
is
not
a
matter
of
knowing
whether
nature
has
been
able
to
produce
in
our
day
as
great
geniuses
and
as
good
works
as
those
of
greek
and
latin
antiquity
but
to
know
whether
we
have
them
in
fact
without
a
doubt
it
is
not
impossible
for
there
to
be
as
big
oaks
in
the
forest
of
chantilli
as
in
the
forest
of
dodona
but
supposing
that
the
oaks
of
dodona
had
spoken
it
would
be
quite
clear
that
they
had
a
great
advantage
over
ours
which
in
all
probability
will
never
speak
nature
is
not
bizarre
but
it
is
possible
that
she
gave
the
athenians
a
country
and
a
sky
more
suitable
than
westphalia
and
the
limousin
for
forming
certain
geniuses
further
it
is
possible
that
the
government
of
athens
by
seconding
the
climate
put
into
demosthenes
head
something
that
the
air
of
climart
and
la
grenouillère
and
the
government
of
cardinal
de
richelieu
did
not
put
into
the
heads
of
omer
talon
and
jérome
bignon
this
dispute
is
therefore
a
question
of
fact
was
antiquity
more
fecund
in
great
monuments
of
all
kinds
up
to
the
time
of
plutarch
than
modern
centuries
have
been
from
the
century
of
the
medicis
up
to
louis
xiv
inclusive
the
chinese
more
than
two
hundred
years
before
our
era
constructed
that
great
wall
which
was
not
able
to
save
them
from
the
invasion
of
the
tartars
the
egyptians
three
thousand
years
before
had
overloaded
the
earth
with
their
astonishing
pyramids
which
had
a
base
of
about
ninety
thousand
square
feet
nobody
doubts
that
if
one
wished
to
undertake
these
useless
works
one
could
easily
succeed
by
a
lavish
expenditure
of
money
the
great
wall
of
china
is
a
monument
to
fear
the
pyramids
are
monuments
to
vanity
and
superstition
both
bear
witness
to
a
great
patience
in
the
peoples
but
to
no
superior
genius
neither
the
chinese
nor
the
egyptians
would
have
been
able
to
make
even
a
statue
such
as
those
which
our
sculptors
form
the
chevalier
temple
who
has
made
it
his
business
to
disparage
all
the
moderns
claims
that
in
architecture
they
have
nothing
comparable
to
the
temples
of
greece
and
rome
but
for
all
that
he
is
english
he
must
agree
that
the
church
of
peter
is
incomparably
more
beautiful
than
the
capitol
was
it
is
curious
with
what
assurance
he
maintains
that
there
is
nothing
new
in
our
astronomy
nothing
in
the
knowledge
of
the
human
body
unless
perhaps
he
says
the
circulation
of
the
blood
love
of
his
own
opinion
founded
on
his
vast
makes
him
forget
the
discovery
of
the
satellites
of
jupiter
of
the
five
moons
and
the
ring
of
saturn
of
the
rotation
of
the
sun
on
its
axis
of
the
calculated
position
of
three
thousand
stars
of
the
laws
given
by
kepler
and
newton
for
the
heavenly
orbs
of
the
causes
of
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
and
of
a
hundred
other
pieces
of
knowledge
of
which
the
ancients
did
not
suspect
even
the
possibility
the
discoveries
in
anatomy
are
as
great
in
number
a
new
universe
in
little
discovered
by
the
microscope
was
counted
for
nothing
by
the
chevalier
temple
he
closed
his
eyes
to
the
marvels
of
his
contemporaries
and
opened
them
only
to
admire
ancient
ignorance
he
goes
so
far
as
to
pity
us
for
having
nothing
left
of
the
magic
of
the
indians
the
chaldeans
the
egyptians
and
by
this
magic
he
understands
a
profound
knowledge
of
nature
whereby
they
produced
miracles
but
he
does
not
cite
one
miracle
because
in
fact
there
never
were
any
what
has
become
he
asks
of
the
charms
of
that
music
which
so
often
enchanted
man
and
beast
the
fishes
the
birds
the
snakes
and
changed
their
nature
this
enemy
of
his
century
really
believes
the
fable
of
orpheus
and
has
not
apparently
heard
either
the
beautiful
music
of
italy
or
even
that
of
france
which
in
truth
does
not
charm
snakes
but
does
charm
the
ears
of
connoisseurs
what
is
still
more
strange
is
that
having
all
his
life
cultivated
he
does
not
reason
better
about
our
good
authors
than
about
our
philosophers
he
looks
on
rabelais
as
a
great
man
he
cites
the
amours
des
gaules
as
one
of
our
best
works
he
was
however
a
scholar
a
courtier
a
man
of
much
wit
an
ambassador
a
man
who
had
reflected
profoundly
on
all
he
had
seen
he
possessed
great
knowledge
a
prejudice
sufficed
to
spoil
all
this
merit
there
are
beauties
in
euripides
and
in
sophocles
still
more
but
they
have
many
more
defects
one
dares
say
that
the
beautiful
scenes
of
corneille
and
the
touching
tragedies
of
racine
surpass
the
tragedies
of
sophocles
and
euripides
as
much
as
these
two
greeks
surpass
thespis
racine
was
quite
conscious
of
his
great
superiority
over
euripides
but
he
praised
the
greek
poet
in
order
to
humiliate
perrault
molière
in
his
good
pieces
is
as
superior
to
the
pure
but
cold
terence
and
to
the
droll
aristophanes
as
to
dancourt
the
buffoon
there
are
therefore
spheres
in
which
the
moderns
are
far
superior
to
the
ancients
and
others
very
few
in
number
in
which
we
are
their
inferiors
it
is
to
this
that
the
whole
dispute
is
reduced
what
a
pitiful
what
a
sorry
thing
to
have
said
that
animals
are
machines
bereft
of
understanding
and
feeling
which
perform
their
operations
always
in
the
same
way
which
learn
nothing
perfect
nothing
what
that
bird
which
makes
its
nest
in
a
when
it
is
attaching
it
to
a
wall
which
builds
it
in
a
quarter
circle
when
it
is
in
an
angle
and
in
a
circle
upon
a
tree
that
bird
acts
always
in
the
same
way
that
which
you
have
disciplined
for
three
months
does
it
not
know
more
at
the
end
of
this
time
than
it
knew
before
your
lessons
does
the
canary
to
which
you
teach
a
tune
repeat
it
at
once
do
you
not
spend
a
considerable
time
in
teaching
it
have
you
not
seen
that
it
has
made
a
mistake
and
that
it
corrects
itself
is
it
because
i
speak
to
you
that
you
judge
that
i
have
feeling
memory
ideas
well
i
do
not
speak
to
you
you
see
me
going
home
looking
disconsolate
seeking
a
paper
anxiously
opening
the
desk
where
i
remember
having
shut
it
finding
it
reading
it
joyfully
you
judge
that
i
have
experienced
the
feeling
of
distress
and
that
of
pleasure
that
i
have
memory
and
understanding
bring
the
same
judgment
to
bear
on
this
dog
which
has
lost
its
master
which
has
sought
him
on
every
road
with
sorrowful
cries
which
enters
the
house
agitated
uneasy
which
goes
down
the
stairs
up
the
stairs
from
room
to
room
which
at
last
finds
in
his
study
the
master
it
loves
and
which
shows
him
its
joy
by
its
cries
of
delight
by
its
leaps
by
its
caresses
barbarians
seize
this
dog
which
in
friendship
surpasses
man
so
prodigiously
they
nail
it
on
a
table
and
they
dissect
it
alive
in
order
to
show
the
mesenteric
veins
you
discover
in
it
all
the
same
organs
of
feeling
that
are
in
yourself
answer
me
machinist
has
nature
arranged
all
the
means
of
feeling
in
this
animal
so
that
it
may
not
feel
has
it
nerves
in
order
to
be
impassible
do
not
suppose
this
impertinent
contradiction
in
nature
but
the
schoolmasters
ask
what
the
soul
of
animals
is
i
do
not
understand
this
question
a
tree
has
the
faculty
of
receiving
in
its
fibres
its
sap
which
circulates
of
unfolding
the
buds
of
its
leaves
and
its
fruit
will
you
ask
what
the
soul
of
this
tree
is
it
has
received
these
gifts
the
animal
has
received
those
of
feeling
of
memory
of
a
certain
number
of
ideas
who
has
bestowed
these
gifts
who
has
given
these
faculties
he
who
has
made
the
grass
of
the
fields
to
grow
and
who
makes
the
earth
gravitate
toward
the
sun
animals
souls
are
substantial
forms
said
aristotle
and
after
aristotle
the
arab
school
and
after
the
arab
school
the
angelical
school
and
after
the
angelical
school
the
sorbonne
and
after
the
sorbonne
nobody
at
all
animals
souls
are
material
cry
other
philosophers
these
have
not
been
in
any
better
fortune
than
the
others
in
vain
have
they
been
asked
what
a
material
soul
is
they
have
to
admit
that
it
is
matter
which
has
sensation
but
what
has
given
it
this
sensation
it
is
a
material
soul
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
matter
which
gives
sensation
to
matter
they
can
not
issue
from
this
circle
listen
to
other
brutes
reasoning
about
the
brutes
their
soul
is
a
spiritual
soul
which
dies
with
the
body
but
what
proof
have
you
of
it
what
idea
have
you
of
this
spiritual
soul
which
in
truth
has
feeling
memory
and
its
measure
of
ideas
and
ingenuity
but
which
will
never
be
able
to
know
what
a
child
of
six
knows
on
what
ground
do
you
imagine
that
this
being
which
is
not
body
dies
with
the
body
the
greatest
fools
are
those
who
have
advanced
that
this
soul
is
neither
body
nor
spirit
there
is
a
fine
system
by
spirit
we
can
understand
only
some
unknown
thing
which
is
not
body
thus
these
gentlemen
system
comes
back
to
this
that
the
animals
soul
is
a
substance
which
is
neither
body
nor
something
which
is
not
body
whence
can
come
so
many
contradictory
errors
from
the
habit
men
have
always
had
of
examining
what
a
thing
is
before
knowing
if
it
exists
the
clapper
the
valve
of
a
bellows
is
called
in
french
the
soul
of
a
bellows
what
is
this
soul
it
is
a
name
that
i
have
given
to
this
valve
which
falls
lets
air
enter
rises
again
and
thrusts
it
through
a
pipe
when
i
make
the
bellows
move
there
is
not
there
a
distinct
soul
in
the
machine
but
what
makes
animals
bellows
move
i
have
already
told
you
what
makes
the
stars
move
the
philosopher
who
said
est
anima
was
right
but
he
should
go
further
have
you
sometimes
seen
in
a
village
pierre
aoudri
and
his
wife
peronelle
wishing
to
go
before
their
neighbours
in
the
procession
our
grandfathers
they
say
were
tolling
the
bells
before
those
who
jostle
us
owned
even
a
the
vanity
of
pierre
aoudri
his
wife
and
his
neighbours
knows
nothing
more
about
it
their
minds
kindle
the
quarrel
is
important
honour
is
in
question
proofs
are
necessary
a
scholar
who
sings
in
the
choir
discovers
an
old
rusty
iron
pot
marked
with
an
a
first
letter
of
the
name
of
the
potter
who
made
the
pot
pierre
aoudri
persuades
himself
that
it
was
his
ancestors
helmet
in
this
way
was
cæsar
descended
from
a
hero
and
from
the
goddess
venus
such
is
the
history
of
nations
such
is
within
very
small
margins
the
knowledge
of
early
antiquity
the
scholars
of
armenia
that
the
terrestrial
paradise
was
in
their
land
some
profound
swedes
that
it
was
near
lake
vener
which
is
visibly
a
remnant
of
it
some
spaniards
also
that
it
was
in
castille
while
the
japanese
the
chinese
the
indians
the
africans
the
americans
are
not
sufficiently
unfortunate
to
know
even
that
there
was
formerly
a
terrestrial
paradise
at
the
source
of
the
phison
the
gehon
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
or
if
you
prefer
it
at
the
source
of
the
guadalquivir
the
guadiana
the
douro
and
the
ebro
for
from
phison
one
easily
makes
phaetis
and
from
phaetis
one
makes
the
baetis
which
is
the
guadalquivir
the
gehon
is
obviously
the
guadiana
which
begins
with
a
the
ebro
which
is
in
catalonia
is
incontestably
the
euphrates
of
which
the
initial
letter
is
but
a
scotsman
appears
who
in
his
turn
that
the
garden
of
eden
was
at
edinburgh
which
has
retained
its
name
and
it
is
to
be
believed
that
in
a
few
centuries
this
opinion
will
make
its
fortune
the
whole
globe
was
burned
once
upon
a
time
says
a
man
versed
in
ancient
and
modern
history
for
i
read
in
a
newspaper
that
some
absolutely
black
charcoal
has
been
found
in
germany
at
a
depth
of
a
hundred
feet
between
mountains
covered
with
wood
and
it
is
suspected
even
that
there
were
charcoal
burners
in
this
place
phaeton
adventure
makes
it
clear
that
everything
has
boiled
right
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
sulphur
of
mount
vesuvius
proves
invincibly
that
the
banks
of
the
rhine
danube
ganges
nile
and
the
great
yellow
river
are
merely
sulphur
nitre
and
guiac
oil
which
only
await
the
moment
of
the
explosion
to
reduce
the
earth
to
ashes
as
it
has
already
been
the
sand
on
which
we
walk
is
evident
proof
that
the
earth
has
been
vitrified
and
that
our
globe
is
really
only
a
glass
ball
just
as
are
our
ideas
but
if
fire
has
changed
our
globe
water
has
produced
still
finer
revolutions
for
you
see
clearly
that
the
sea
the
tides
of
which
mount
as
high
as
eight
feet
in
our
climate
has
produced
mountains
of
a
height
of
sixteen
to
seventeen
thousand
feet
this
is
so
true
that
some
learned
men
who
have
never
been
in
switzerland
have
found
a
big
ship
with
all
its
rigging
petrified
on
mount
gothard
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
one
knows
not
where
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
it
was
there
therefore
men
were
originally
fish
erat
to
descend
to
a
less
antique
antiquity
let
us
speak
of
the
times
when
the
greater
part
of
the
barbarous
nations
left
their
countries
to
go
to
seek
others
which
were
hardly
any
better
it
is
true
if
there
be
anything
true
in
ancient
history
that
there
were
some
gaulish
brigands
who
went
to
pillage
rome
in
the
time
of
camillus
other
gaulish
brigands
had
passed
it
is
said
through
illyria
on
the
way
to
hire
their
services
as
murderers
to
other
murderers
in
the
direction
of
thrace
they
exchanged
their
blood
for
bread
and
later
established
themselves
in
galatia
but
who
were
these
gauls
were
they
berichons
and
angevins
they
were
without
a
doubt
gauls
whom
the
romans
called
cisalpines
and
whom
we
call
transalpines
famished
neighbours
of
the
alps
and
the
apennines
the
gauls
of
the
seine
and
the
marne
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
rome
existed
and
could
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
pass
mount
cenis
as
hannibal
did
later
to
go
to
steal
the
wardrobes
of
roman
senators
who
at
that
time
for
all
furniture
had
a
robe
of
poor
grey
stuff
ornamented
with
a
band
the
colour
of
ox
blood
two
little
pummels
of
ivory
or
rather
dog
bone
on
the
arms
of
a
wooden
chair
and
in
their
kitchens
a
piece
of
rancid
bacon
the
gauls
who
were
dying
of
hunger
not
finding
anything
to
eat
in
rome
went
off
therefore
to
seek
their
fortune
farther
away
as
was
the
practice
of
the
romans
later
when
they
ravaged
so
many
countries
one
after
the
other
as
did
the
peoples
of
the
north
when
they
destroyed
the
roman
empire
and
further
what
is
it
which
instructs
very
feebly
about
these
emigrations
it
is
a
few
lines
that
the
romans
wrote
at
hazard
because
for
the
celts
the
velches
or
the
gauls
these
men
who
it
is
desired
to
make
pass
for
eloquent
at
that
time
did
not
know
they
and
their
bards
how
either
to
read
or
write
but
to
infer
from
that
that
the
gauls
or
celts
conquered
after
by
a
few
of
cæsar
legions
and
by
a
horde
of
bourguignons
and
lastly
by
a
horde
of
sicamores
under
one
clodovic
had
previously
subjugated
the
whole
world
and
given
their
names
and
laws
to
asia
seems
to
me
to
be
very
strange
the
thing
is
not
mathematically
impossible
and
if
it
be
i
give
way
it
would
be
very
uncivil
to
refuse
to
the
velches
what
one
accords
to
the
tartars
that
the
newness
of
the
arts
in
no
wise
proves
the
newness
of
the
globe
all
the
philosophers
thought
matter
eternal
but
the
arts
appear
new
there
is
not
one
even
to
the
art
of
making
bread
which
is
not
recent
the
first
romans
ate
pap
and
these
conquerors
of
so
many
nations
never
thought
of
either
windmills
or
watermills
this
truth
seems
at
first
to
contradict
the
antiquity
of
the
globe
such
as
it
is
or
supposes
terrible
revolutions
in
this
globe
the
inundations
of
barbarians
can
hardly
annihilate
arts
which
have
become
necessary
i
suppose
that
an
army
of
negroes
come
among
us
like
locusts
from
the
mountains
of
cobonas
through
the
monomotapa
the
monoemugi
the
nosseguais
the
maracates
that
they
have
traversed
abyssinia
nubia
egypt
syria
asia
minor
the
whole
of
our
europe
that
they
have
overthrown
everything
ransacked
everything
there
will
still
remain
a
few
bakers
a
few
cobblers
a
few
tailors
a
few
carpenters
the
necessary
arts
will
survive
only
luxury
will
be
annihilated
it
is
what
was
seen
at
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
art
of
writing
even
became
very
rare
almost
all
those
which
contributed
to
the
comfort
of
life
were
reborn
only
long
after
we
invent
new
ones
every
day
from
all
this
one
can
at
bottom
conclude
nothing
against
the
antiquity
of
the
globe
for
supposing
even
that
an
influx
of
barbarians
had
made
us
lose
entirely
all
the
arts
even
to
the
arts
of
writing
and
making
bread
supposing
further
that
for
ten
years
past
we
had
no
bread
pens
ink
and
paper
the
land
which
has
been
able
to
subsist
for
ten
years
without
eating
bread
and
without
writing
its
thoughts
would
be
able
to
pass
a
century
and
a
hundred
thousand
centuries
without
these
aids
it
is
quite
clear
that
man
and
the
other
animals
can
exist
very
well
without
bakers
without
novelists
and
without
theologians
witness
the
whole
of
america
witness
three
quarters
of
our
continent
the
newness
of
the
arts
among
us
does
not
therefore
prove
the
newness
of
the
globe
as
was
claimed
by
epicurus
one
of
our
predecessors
in
reverie
who
supposed
that
by
chance
the
eternal
atoms
in
declining
had
one
day
formed
our
earth
pomponace

astrology
may
rest
on
better
foundations
than
magic
for
if
no
one
has
seen
either
goblins
or
lemures
or
dives
or
peris
or
demons
or
cacodemons
the
predictions
of
astrologers
have
often
been
seen
to
succeed
if
of
two
astrologers
consulted
on
the
life
of
a
child
and
on
the
weather
one
says
that
the
child
will
live
to
manhood
the
other
not
if
one
announces
rain
and
the
other
fine
weather
it
is
clear
that
one
of
them
will
be
a
prophet
the
great
misfortune
of
the
astrologers
is
that
the
sky
has
changed
since
the
rules
of
the
art
were
established
the
sun
which
at
the
equinox
was
in
aries
in
the
time
of
the
argonauts
is
in
taurus
and
the
astrologers
to
the
great
of
their
art
attribute
to
one
house
of
the
sun
what
belongs
visibly
to
another
however
that
is
not
a
demonstrative
reason
against
astrology
the
masters
of
the
art
deceive
themselves
but
it
is
not
demonstrated
that
the
art
can
not
exist
there
is
no
absurdity
in
saying
such
and
such
a
child
is
born
in
the
waxing
of
the
moon
during
stormy
weather
at
the
rising
of
such
and
such
star
his
constitution
has
been
feeble
and
his
life
unhappy
and
short
which
is
the
ordinary
lot
of
poor
constitutions
this
child
on
the
contrary
was
born
when
the
moon
was
full
the
sun
strong
the
weather
calm
at
the
rising
of
such
and
such
star
his
constitution
has
been
good
his
life
long
and
happy
if
these
observations
had
been
repeated
if
they
had
been
found
accurate
experience
would
have
been
able
after
some
thousands
of
years
to
form
an
art
which
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
doubt
one
would
have
thought
with
some
likelihood
that
men
are
like
trees
and
vegetables
which
must
be
planted
and
sown
only
in
certain
seasons
it
would
have
been
of
no
avail
against
the
astrologers
to
say
my
son
was
born
at
a
fortunate
time
and
nevertheless
died
in
his
cradle
the
astrologer
would
have
answered
it
often
happens
that
trees
planted
in
the
proper
season
perish
i
answered
to
you
for
the
stars
but
i
did
not
answer
for
the
flaw
of
conformation
you
communicated
to
your
child
astrology
operates
only
when
no
cause
opposes
itself
to
the
good
the
stars
can
do
one
would
not
have
succeeded
better
in
discrediting
the
astrologer
by
saying
of
two
children
who
were
born
in
the
same
minute
one
has
been
king
the
other
has
been
only
churchwarden
of
his
parish
for
the
astrologer
could
very
well
have
defended
himself
by
pointing
out
that
the
peasant
made
his
fortune
when
he
became
churchwarden
as
the
prince
when
he
became
king
and
if
one
alleged
that
a
bandit
whom
sixtus
had
hanged
was
born
at
the
same
time
as
sixtus
who
from
a
became
pope
the
astrologers
would
say
one
had
made
a
mistake
of
a
few
seconds
and
that
it
is
impossible
according
to
the
rules
for
the
same
star
to
give
the
triple
crown
and
the
gibbet
it
is
then
only
because
a
host
of
experiences
belied
the
predictions
that
men
perceived
at
last
that
the
art
was
illusory
but
before
being
undeceived
they
were
long
credulous
one
of
the
most
famous
mathematicians
in
europe
named
stoffler
who
flourished
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
and
who
long
worked
at
the
reform
of
the
calendar
proposed
at
the
council
of
constance
foretold
a
universal
flood
for
the
year
this
flood
was
to
arrive
in
the
month
of
february
and
nothing
is
more
plausible
for
saturn
jupiter
and
mars
were
then
in
conjunction
in
the
sign
of
pisces
all
the
peoples
of
europe
asia
and
africa
who
heard
speak
of
the
prediction
were
dismayed
everyone
expected
the
flood
despite
the
rainbow
several
contemporary
authors
record
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
maritime
provinces
of
germany
hastened
to
sell
their
lands
dirt
cheap
to
those
who
had
most
money
and
who
were
not
so
credulous
as
they
everyone
armed
himself
with
a
boat
as
with
an
ark
a
toulouse
doctor
named
auriol
had
a
great
ark
made
for
himself
his
family
and
his
friends
the
same
precautions
were
taken
over
a
large
part
of
italy
at
last
the
month
of
february
arrived
and
not
a
drop
of
water
fell
never
was
month
more
dry
and
never
were
the
astrologers
more
embarrassed
nevertheless
they
were
not
discouraged
nor
neglected
among
us
almost
all
princes
continued
to
consult
them
i
have
not
the
honour
of
being
a
prince
but
the
celebrated
count
of
boulainvilliers
and
an
italian
named
colonne
who
had
much
prestige
in
paris
both
foretold
that
i
should
die
infallibly
at
the
age
of
i
have
been
so
malicious
as
to
deceive
them
already
by
nearly
thirty
years
wherefore
i
humbly
beg
their
pardon
section
i
of
the
comparison
so
often
made
between
atheism
and
idolatry
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
encyclopedic
dictionary
the
opinion
of
the
jesuit
richeome
on
atheists
and
idolaters
has
not
been
refuted
as
strongly
as
it
might
have
been
opinion
held
formerly
by
thomas
gregory
of
nazianze
cyprian
and
tertullian
opinion
that
arnobius
set
forth
with
much
force
when
he
said
to
the
pagans
do
you
not
blush
to
reproach
us
with
despising
your
gods
and
is
it
not
much
more
proper
to
believe
in
no
god
at
all
than
to
impute
to
them
infamous
actions
opinion
established
long
before
by
plutarch
who
says
that
he
much
prefers
people
to
say
there
is
no
plutarch
than
to
say
is
an
inconstant
choleric
vindictive
plutarch
opinion
strengthened
finally
by
all
the
effort
of
bayle
dialectic
here
is
the
ground
of
dispute
brought
to
fairly
dazzling
light
by
the
jesuit
richeome
and
rendered
still
more
plausible
by
the
way
bayle
has
turned
it
to
account
there
are
two
porters
at
the
door
of
a
house
they
are
asked
one
speak
to
your
master
is
not
there
answers
one
is
there
answers
the
other
he
is
busy
making
counterfeit
money
forged
contracts
daggers
and
poisons
to
undo
those
who
have
but
accomplished
his
purposes
the
atheist
resembles
the
first
of
these
porters
the
pagan
the
other
it
is
clear
therefore
that
the
pagan
offends
the
deity
more
gravely
than
does
the
atheist
with
father
richeome
and
even
bayle
permission
that
is
not
at
all
the
position
of
the
matter
for
the
first
porter
to
resemble
the
atheists
he
must
not
say
my
master
is
not
here
he
should
say
i
have
no
master
him
whom
you
claim
to
be
my
master
does
not
exist
my
comrade
is
a
fool
to
tell
you
that
he
is
busy
compounding
poisons
and
sharpening
daggers
to
assassinate
those
who
have
executed
his
caprices
no
such
being
exists
in
the
world
richeome
has
reasoned
therefore
very
badly
and
bayle
in
his
somewhat
diffuse
discourses
has
forgotten
himself
so
far
as
to
do
richeome
the
honour
of
annotating
him
very
malapropos
plutarch
seems
to
express
himself
much
better
in
preferring
people
who
affirm
there
is
no
plutarch
to
those
who
claim
plutarch
to
be
an
unsociable
man
in
truth
what
does
it
matter
to
him
that
people
say
he
is
not
in
the
world
but
it
matters
much
to
him
that
his
reputation
be
not
tarnished
it
is
not
thus
with
the
supreme
being
plutarch
even
does
not
broach
the
real
object
under
discussion
it
is
not
a
question
of
knowing
who
offends
more
the
supreme
being
whether
it
be
he
who
denies
him
or
he
who
distorts
him
it
is
impossible
to
know
otherwise
than
by
revelation
if
god
is
offended
by
the
empty
things
men
say
of
him
without
a
thought
philosophers
fall
almost
always
into
the
ideas
of
the
common
herd
in
supposing
god
to
be
jealous
of
his
glory
to
be
choleric
to
love
vengeance
and
in
taking
rhetorical
figures
for
real
ideas
the
interesting
subject
for
the
whole
universe
is
to
know
if
it
be
not
better
for
the
good
of
all
mankind
to
admit
a
rewarding
and
revengeful
god
who
recompenses
good
actions
hidden
and
who
punishes
secret
crimes
than
to
admit
none
at
all
bayle
exhausts
himself
in
recounting
all
the
infamies
imputed
by
fable
to
the
gods
of
antiquity
his
adversaries
answer
him
with
commonplaces
that
signify
nothing
the
partisans
of
bayle
and
his
enemies
have
almost
always
fought
without
making
contact
they
all
agree
that
jupiter
was
an
adulterer
venus
a
wanton
mercury
a
rogue
but
as
i
see
it
that
is
not
what
needs
consideration
one
must
distinguish
between
ovid
metamorphoses
and
the
religion
of
the
ancient
romans
it
is
quite
certain
that
never
among
the
romans
or
even
among
the
greeks
was
there
a
temple
dedicated
to
mercury
the
rogue
venus
the
wanton
jupiter
the
adulterer
the
god
whom
the
romans
called
very
good
very
great
was
not
reputed
to
encourage
clodius
to
sleep
with
cæsar
wife
or
cæsar
to
be
king
nicomedes
sodomite
cicero
does
not
say
that
mercury
incited
verres
to
steal
sicily
although
mercury
in
the
fable
had
stolen
apollo
cows
the
real
religion
of
the
ancients
was
that
jupiter
good
and
very
and
the
secondary
gods
punished
the
perjurer
in
the
infernal
regions
likewise
the
romans
were
long
the
most
religious
observers
of
oaths
religion
was
very
useful
therefore
to
the
romans
there
was
no
command
to
believe
in
leda
two
eggs
in
the
changing
of
inachus
daughter
into
a
cow
in
the
love
of
apollo
for
hyacinthus
one
must
not
say
therefore
that
the
religion
of
numa
dishonoured
the
deity
for
a
long
time
therefore
people
have
been
disputing
over
a
chimera
which
happens
only
too
often
the
question
is
then
asked
whether
a
nation
of
atheists
can
exist
it
seems
to
me
that
one
must
distinguish
between
the
nation
properly
so
called
and
a
society
of
philosophers
above
the
nation
it
is
very
true
that
in
every
country
the
populace
has
need
of
the
greatest
curb
and
that
if
bayle
had
had
only
five
or
six
hundred
peasants
to
govern
he
would
not
have
failed
to
announce
to
them
the
existence
of
a
god
rewarder
and
revenger
but
bayle
would
not
have
spoken
of
him
to
the
epicureans
who
were
rich
people
fond
of
rest
cultivating
all
the
social
virtues
and
above
all
friendship
fleeing
the
embarrassment
and
danger
of
public
affairs
in
fine
leading
a
comfortable
and
innocent
life
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
way
the
dispute
is
finished
as
regards
society
and
politics
for
entirely
savage
races
it
has
been
said
already
that
one
can
not
count
them
among
either
the
atheists
or
the
theists
asking
them
their
belief
would
be
like
asking
them
if
they
are
for
aristotle
or
democritus
they
know
nothing
they
are
not
atheists
any
more
than
they
are
peripatetics
in
this
case
i
shall
answer
that
the
wolves
live
like
this
and
that
an
assembly
of
cannibal
barbarians
such
as
you
suppose
them
is
not
a
society
and
i
shall
always
ask
you
if
when
you
have
lent
your
money
to
someone
in
your
society
you
want
neither
your
debtor
nor
your
attorney
nor
your
judge
to
believe
in
god
of
modern
atheists
reasons
of
the
worshippers
of
god
we
are
intelligent
beings
intelligent
beings
can
not
have
been
formed
by
a
crude
blind
insensible
being
there
is
certainly
some
difference
between
the
ideas
of
newton
and
the
dung
of
a
mule
intelligence
therefore
came
from
another
intelligence
when
we
see
a
beautiful
machine
we
say
that
there
is
a
good
engineer
and
that
this
engineer
has
excellent
judgment
the
world
is
assuredly
an
admirable
machine
therefore
there
is
in
the
world
an
admirable
intelligence
wherever
it
may
be
this
argument
is
old
and
none
the
worse
for
that
all
living
bodies
are
composed
of
levers
of
pulleys
which
function
according
to
the
laws
of
mechanics
of
liquids
which
the
laws
of
hydrostatics
cause
to
circulate
perpetually
and
when
one
thinks
that
all
these
beings
have
a
perception
quite
unrelated
to
their
organization
one
is
overwhelmed
with
surprise
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
that
of
our
little
earth
round
the
sun
all
operate
by
virtue
of
the
most
profound
mathematical
law
how
plato
who
was
not
aware
of
one
of
these
laws
eloquent
but
visionary
plato
who
said
that
the
earth
was
erected
on
an
equilateral
triangle
and
the
water
on
a
triangle
strange
plato
who
says
there
can
be
only
five
worlds
because
there
are
only
five
regular
bodies
how
i
say
did
plato
who
did
not
know
even
spherical
trigonometry
have
nevertheless
a
genius
sufficiently
fine
an
instinct
sufficiently
happy
to
call
god
the
eternal
geometer
to
feel
the
existence
of
a
creative
intelligence
spinoza
himself
admits
it
it
is
impossible
to
strive
against
this
truth
which
surrounds
us
and
which
presses
on
us
from
all
sides
reasons
of
the
atheists
notwithstanding
i
have
known
refractory
persons
who
say
that
there
is
no
creative
intelligence
at
all
and
that
movement
alone
has
by
itself
formed
all
that
we
see
and
all
that
we
are
they
tell
you
brazenly
the
combination
of
this
universe
was
possible
seeing
that
the
combination
exists
therefore
it
was
possible
that
movement
alone
arranged
it
take
four
of
the
heavenly
bodies
only
mars
venus
mercury
and
the
earth
let
us
think
first
only
of
the
place
where
they
are
setting
aside
all
the
rest
and
let
us
see
how
many
probabilities
we
have
that
movement
alone
put
them
in
their
respective
places
we
have
only
chances
in
this
combination
that
is
there
are
only
chances
against
one
to
bet
that
these
bodies
will
not
be
where
they
are
with
reference
to
each
other
let
us
add
to
these
four
globes
that
of
jupiter
there
will
be
only
a
hundred
and
twenty
against
one
to
bet
that
jupiter
mars
venus
mercury
and
our
globe
will
not
be
placed
where
we
see
them
add
finally
saturn
there
will
be
only
seven
hundred
and
twenty
chances
against
one
for
putting
these
six
big
planets
in
the
arrangement
they
preserve
among
themselves
according
to
their
given
distances
it
is
therefore
demonstrated
that
in
seven
hundred
and
twenty
throws
movement
alone
has
been
able
to
put
these
six
principal
planets
in
their
order
take
then
all
the
secondary
bodies
all
their
combinations
all
their
movements
all
the
beings
that
vegetate
that
live
that
feel
that
think
that
function
in
all
the
globes
you
will
have
but
to
increase
the
number
of
chances
multiply
this
number
in
all
eternity
up
to
the
number
which
our
feebleness
calls
there
will
always
be
a
unity
in
favour
of
the
formation
of
the
world
such
as
it
is
by
movement
alone
therefore
it
is
possible
that
in
all
eternity
the
movement
of
matter
alone
has
produced
the
entire
universe
such
as
it
exists
it
is
even
inevitable
that
in
eternity
this
combination
should
occur
thus
they
say
not
only
is
it
possible
for
the
world
to
be
what
it
is
by
movement
alone
but
it
was
impossible
for
it
not
to
be
likewise
after
an
infinity
of
combinations
answer
all
this
supposition
seems
to
me
prodigiously
fantastic
for
two
reasons
first
that
in
this
universe
there
are
intelligent
beings
and
that
you
would
not
know
how
to
prove
it
possible
for
movement
alone
to
produce
understanding
second
that
from
your
own
avowal
there
is
infinity
against
one
to
bet
that
an
intelligent
creative
cause
animates

when

face

small
again
spinoza
himself
admits
this
intelligence
it
is
the
basis
of
his
system
you
have
not
read
it
and
it
must
be
read
why
do
you
want
to
go
further
than
him
and
in
foolish
arrogance
plunge
your
feeble
reason
in
an
abyss
into
which
spinoza
dared
not
descend
do
you
realize
thoroughly
the
extreme
folly
of
saying
that
it
is
a
blind
cause
that
arranges
that
the
square
of
a
planet
revolution
is
always
to
the
square
of
the
revolutions
of
other
planets
as
the
cube
of
its
distance
is
to
the
cube
of
the
distances
of
the
others
to
the
common
centre
either
the
heavenly
bodies
are
great
geometers
or
the
eternal
geometer
has
arranged
the
heavenly
bodies
but
where
is
the
eternal
geometer
is
he
in
one
place
or
in
all
places
without
occupying
space
i
have
no
idea
is
it
of
his
own
substance
that
he
has
arranged
all
things
i
have
no
idea
is
he
immense
without
quantity
and
without
quality
i
have
no
idea
all
that
i
know
is
that
one
must
worship
him
and
be
just
new
objection
of
a
modern
atheist
can
one
say
that
the
parts
of
animals
conform
to
their
needs
what
are
these
needs
preservation
and
propagation
is
it
astonishing
then
that
of
the
infinite
combinations
which
chance
has
produced
there
has
been
able
to
subsist
only
those
that
have
organs
adapted
to
the
nourishment
and
continuation
of
their
species
have
not
all
the
others
perished
of
necessity
answer
this
objection
since
lucretius
is
sufficiently
refuted
by
the
gift
of
sensation
in
animals
and
by
the
gift
of
intelligence
in
man
how
should
combinations
which
chance
has
produced
produce
this
sensation
and
this
intelligence
as
has
just
been
said
in
the
preceding
paragraph
without
any
doubt
the
limbs
of
animals
are
made
for
their
needs
with
incomprehensible
art
and
you
are
not
so
bold
as
to
deny
it
you
say
no
more
about
it
you
feel
that
you
have
nothing
to
answer
to
this
great
argument
which
nature
brings
against
you
the
disposition
of
a
fly
wing
a
snail
organs
suffices
to
bring
you
to
the
ground
maupertuis
objection
modern
natural
philosophers
have
but
expanded
these
arguments
often
they
have
pushed
them
to
trifling
and
indecency
they
have
found
god
in
the
folds
of
the
skin
of
the
rhinoceros
one
could
with
equal
reason
deny
his
existence
because
of
the
tortoise
shell
answer
what
reasoning
the
tortoise
and
the
rhinoceros
and
all
the
different
species
are
proof
equally
in
their
infinite
variety
of
the
same
cause
the
same
design
the
same
aim
which
are
preservation
generation
and
death
there
is
unity
in
this
infinite
variety
the
shell
and
the
skin
bear
witness
equally
what
deny
god
because
shell
does
not
resemble
leather
and
journalists
have
been
prodigal
of
eulogies
about
these
ineptitudes
eulogies
they
have
not
given
to
newton
and
locke
both
worshippers
of
the
deity
who
spoke
with
full
knowledge
maupertuis
objection
of
what
use
are
beauty
and
proportion
in
the
construction
of
the
snake
they
may
have
uses
some
say
of
which
we
are
ignorant
at
least
let
us
be
silent
then
let
us
not
admire
an
animal
which
we
know
only
by
the
harm
it
does
answer
and
be
you
silent
too
seeing
that
you
can
not
conceive
its
utility
any
more
than
i
can
or
avow
that
in
reptiles
everything
is
admirably
proportioned
some
are
venomous
you
have
been
so
yourself
here
there
is
question
only
of
the
prodigious
art
which
has
formed
snakes
quadrupeds
birds
fish
and
bipeds
this
art
is
sufficiently
evident
you
ask
why
the
snake
does
harm
and
you
why
have
you
done
harm
so
many
times
why
have
you
been
a
persecutor
which
is
the
greatest
of
all
crimes
for
a
philosopher
that
is
another
question
a
question
of
moral
and
physical
for
long
has
one
asked
why
there
are
so
many
snakes
and
so
many
wicked
men
worse
than
snakes
if
flies
could
reason
they
would
complain
to
god
of
the
existence
of
spiders
but
they
would
admit
what
minerva
admitted
about
arachne
in
the
fable
that
she
arranges
her
web
marvellously
one
is
bound
therefore
to
recognize
an
ineffable
intelligence
which
even
spinoza
admitted
one
must
agree
that
this
intelligence
shines
in
the
vilest
insect
as
in
the
stars
and
as
regards
moral
and
physical
ill
what
can
one
say
what
do
console
oneself
by
enjoying
physical
and
moral
good
in
worshipping
the
eternal
being
who
has
made
one
and
permitted
the
other
one
more
word
on
this
subject
atheism
is
the
vice
of
a
few
intelligent
persons
and
superstition
is
the
vice
of
fools
but
rogues
what
are
they
rogues
section
ii
let
us
say
a
word
on
the
moral
question
set
in
action
by
bayle
to
know
if
a
society
of
atheists
could
exist
let
us
mark
first
of
all
in
this
matter
what
is
the
enormous
contradiction
of
men
in
this
dispute
those
who
have
risen
against
bayle
opinion
with
the
greatest
ardour
those
who
have
denied
with
the
greatest
insults
the
possibility
of
a
society
of
atheists
have
since
maintained
with
the
same
intrepidity
that
atheism
is
the
religion
of
the
government
of
china
assuredly
they
are
quite
mistaken
about
the
chinese
government
they
had
but
to
read
the
edicts
of
the
emperors
of
this
vast
country
to
have
seen
that
these
edicts
are
sermons
and
that
everywhere
there
is
mention
of
the
supreme
being
ruler
revenger
rewarder
but
at
the
same
time
they
are
not
less
mistaken
on
the
impossibility
of
a
society
of
atheists
and
i
do
not
know
how
bayle
can
have
forgotten
one
striking
example
which
was
capable
of
making
his
cause
victorious
in
what
does
a
society
of
atheists
appear
impossible
it
is
that
one
judges
that
men
who
had
no
check
could
never
live
together
that
laws
can
do
nothing
against
secret
crimes
that
a
revengeful
god
who
punishes
in
this
world
or
the
other
the
wicked
who
have
escaped
human
justice
is
necessary
the
laws
of
moses
it
is
true
did
not
teach
a
life
to
come
did
not
threaten
punishments
after
death
did
not
teach
the
first
jews
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
the
jews
far
from
being
atheists
far
from
believing
in
avoiding
divine
vengeance
were
the
most
religious
of
all
men
not
only
did
they
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
eternal
god
but
they
believed
him
always
present
among
them
they
trembled
lest
they
be
punished
in
themselves
in
their
wives
in
their
children
in
their
posterity
even
unto
the
fourth
generation
this
curb
was
very
potent
but
among
the
gentiles
many
sects
had
no
curb
the
sceptics
doubted
everything
the
academicians
suspended
judgment
on
everything
the
epicureans
were
persuaded
that
the
deity
could
not
mix
himself
in
the
affairs
of
men
and
at
bottom
they
admitted
no
deity
they
were
convinced
that
the
soul
is
not
a
substance
but
a
faculty
which
is
born
and
which
perishes
with
the
body
consequently
they
had
no
yoke
other
than
morality
and
honour
the
roman
senators
and
knights
were
veritable
atheists
for
the
gods
did
not
exist
for
men
who
neither
feared
nor
hoped
anything
from
them
the
roman
senate
in
the
time
of
cæsar
and
cicero
was
therefore
really
an
assembly
of
atheists
that
great
orator
in
his
harangue
for
cluentius
says
to
the
whole
senate
in
assembly
what
ill
does
death
do
him
we
reject
all
the
inept
fables
of
the
nether
regions
of
what
then
has
death
deprived
him
of
nothing
but
the
consciousness
of
suffering
does
not
cæsar
the
friend
of
cataline
wishing
to
save
his
life
against
this
same
cicero
object
to
him
that
to
make
a
criminal
die
is
not
to
punish
him
at
all
that
death
that
it
is
merely
the
end
of
our
ills
that
it
is
a
moment
more
happy
than
calamitous
and
do
not
cicero
and
the
whole
senate
surrender
to
these
reasons
the
conquerors
and
the
legislators
of
the
known
universe
formed
visibly
therefore
a
society
of
men
who
feared
nothing
from
the
gods
who
were
real
atheists
further
on
bayle
examines
whether
idolatry
is
more
dangerous
than
atheism
if
it
is
a
greater
crime
not
to
believe
in
the
deity
than
to
have
unworthy
opinions
thereof
in
that
he
is
of
plutarch
opinion
he
believes
it
is
better
to
have
no
opinion
than
to
have
a
bad
opinion
but
with
all
deference
to
plutarch
it
was
clearly
infinitely
better
for
the
greeks
to
fear
ceres
neptune
and
jupiter
than
to
fear
nothing
at
all
the
sanctity
of
oaths
is
clearly
necessary
and
one
should
have
more
confidence
in
those
who
believe
that
a
false
oath
will
be
punished
than
in
those
who
think
they
can
make
a
false
oath
with
impunity
it
is
indubitable
that
in
a
civilized
town
it
is
infinitely
more
useful
to
have
a
religion
even
a
bad
one
than
to
have
none
at
all
it
looks
therefore
that
bayle
should
have
examined
rather
which
is
the
more
dangerous
fanaticism
or
atheism
fanaticism
is
certainly
a
thousand
times
more
deadly
for
atheism
inspires
no
bloody
passion
whereas
fanaticism
does
atheism
is
not
opposed
to
crime
but
fanaticism
causes
crimes
to
be
committed
fanatics
committed
the
massacres
of
bartholomew
hobbes
passed
for
an
atheist
he
led
a
tranquil
and
innocent
life
the
fanatics
of
his
time
deluged
england
scotland
and
ireland
with
blood
spinoza
was
not
only
atheist
but
he
taught
atheism
it
was
not
he
assuredly
who
took
part
in
the
judicial
assassination
of
barneveldt
it
was
not
he
who
tore
the
brothers
de
witt
in
pieces
and
who
ate
them
grilled
the
atheists
are
for
the
most
part
impudent
and
misguided
scholars
who
reason
badly
and
who
not
being
able
to
understand
the
creation
the
origin
of
evil
and
other
difficulties
have
recourse
to
the
hypothesis
of
the
eternity
of
things
and
of
inevitability
the
ambitious
the
sensual
have
hardly
time
for
reasoning
and
for
embracing
a
bad
system
they
have
other
things
to
do
than
comparing
lucretius
with
socrates
that
is
how
things
go
among
us
that
was
not
how
things
went
with
the
roman
senate
which
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
atheists
in
theory
and
in
practice
that
is
to
say
who
believed
in
neither
a
providence
nor
a
future
life
this
senate
was
an
assembly
of
philosophers
of
sensualists
and
ambitious
men
all
very
dangerous
who
ruined
the
republic
epicureanism
existed
under
the
emperors
the
atheists
of
the
senate
had
been
rebels
in
the
time
of
sylla
and
cæsar
under
augustus
and
tiberius
they
were
atheist
slaves
i
would
not
wish
to
have
to
deal
with
an
atheist
prince
who
would
find
it
to
his
interest
to
have
me
ground
to
powder
in
a
mortar
i
should
be
quite
sure
of
being
ground
to
powder
if
i
were
a
sovereign
i
would
not
wish
to
have
to
deal
with
atheist
courtiers
whose
interest
it
would
be
to
poison
me
i
should
have
to
be
taking
antidotes
every
day
it
is
therefore
absolutely
necessary
for
princes
and
for
peoples
that
the
idea
of
a
supreme
being
creator
ruler
rewarder
revenger
shall
be
deeply
engraved
in
people
minds
bayle
says
in
his
thoughts
on
the
comets
that
there
are
atheist
peoples
the
caffres
the
hottentots
the
topinambous
and
many
other
small
nations
have
no
god
they
neither
deny
nor
affirm
they
have
never
heard
speak
of
him
tell
them
that
there
is
a
god
they
will
believe
it
easily
tell
them
that
everything
happens
through
the
nature
of
things
they
will
believe
you
equally
to
claim
that
they
are
atheists
is
to
make
the
same
imputation
as
if
one
said
they
are
they
are
neither
for
nor
against
descartes
they
are
real
children
a
child
is
neither
atheist
nor
deist
he
is
nothing
what
conclusion
shall
we
draw
from
all
this
that
atheism
is
a
very
pernicious
monster
in
those
who
govern
that
it
is
also
pernicious
in
the
persons
around
statesmen
although
their
lives
may
be
innocent
because
from
their
cabinets
it
may
pierce
right
to
the
statesmen
themselves
that
if
it
is
not
so
deadly
as
fanaticism
it
is
nearly
always
fatal
to
virtue
let
us
add
especially
that
there
are
less
atheists
than
ever
since
philosophers
have
recognized
that
there
is
no
being
vegetating
without
germ
no
germ
without
a
plan
and
that
wheat
comes
in
no
wise
from
putrefaction
some
geometers
who
are
not
philosophers
have
rejected
final
causes
but
real
philosophers
admit
them
a
catechist

god
to
the
children
and
newton
demonstrates
him
to
the

there
are

not
the
mercenary
tyrants

most
barbarous
of

therefore
there
is
no

but
they
should
say
therefore
our
masters
attribute
to
god
their
absurdities

therefore
god

denounces
them

speak
as
little
of
yourself
as
possible

you
must
know

is

as
yours
he
will
never

you
for
wanting

an

a

to

you

they

when
voltaire
was

it
was
the
police
lieutenant
of
paris
who
had
under
the
chancellor
the
inspection
of
books
since
then
a
part
of
his
department
has
been
taken
from
him
he
has
kept
only
the
inspection
of
theatrical
plays
and
works
below
those
on

the
detail
of
this
part
is
immense
in
paris
one
is
not
permitted
to
print
that
one
has
lost
one

unless
the

are
assured
that
in

one
condemns
delinquents
or
those
one
wishes
to
appear
as
such
not
long
ago
one
banished
outside
the
sphere
of
jurisdiction
a
petty
thief
a
petty
forger
a
man
guilty
of
an
act
of
violence
the
result
was
that
he
became
a
big
robber
a
forger
on
a
big
scale
and
murderer
within
the
sphere
of
another
jurisdiction
it
is
as
if
we
threw
into
our
neighbours
fields
the
stones
which
incommode
us
in
our
own
those
who
have
written
on
the
rights
of
men
have
been
much
tormented
to
know
for
certain
if
a
man
who
has
been
banished
from
his
fatherland
still
belongs
to
his
fatherland
it
is
nearly
the
same
thing
as
asking
if
a
gambler
who
has
been
driven
away
from
the
is
still
one
of
the
gamblers
if
to
every
man
it
is
permitted
by
natural
right
to
choose
his
fatherland
he
who
has
lost
the
right
of
citizen
can
with
all
the
more
reason
choose
for
himself
a
new
fatherland
but
can
he
bear
arms
against
his
former
there
are
a
thousand
examples
of
it
how
many
french
protestants
naturalized
in
holland
england
and
germany
have
served
against
france
and
against
armies
containing
their
own
kindred
and
their
own
brothers
the
greeks
who
were
in
the
king
of
persia
armies
made
war
on
the
greeks
their
former
compatriots
one
has
seen
the
swiss
in
the
dutch
service
fire
on
the
swiss
in
the
french
service
it
is
still
worse
than
to
fight
against
those
who
have
banished
you
for
after
all
it
seems
less
dishonest
to
draw
the
sword
for
vengeance
than
to
draw
it
for
money
few
bankruptcies
were
known
in
france
before
the
sixteenth
century
the
great
reason
is
that
there
were
no
bankers
lombards
jews
lent
on
security
at
ten
per
cent
trade
was
conducted
in
cash
exchange
remittances
to
foreign
countries
were
a
secret
unknown
to
all
judges
it
is
not
that
many
people
were
not
ruined
but
that
was
not
called
one
said
this
word
is
sweeter
to
the
ear
one
used
the
word
as
did
the
boulonnais
but
rupture
does
not
sound
so
well
the
bankruptcies
came
to
us
from
italy
bancarotta
gambarotta
e
la
giustizia
non
every
merchant
had
his
bench
in
the
place
of
exchange
and
when
he
had
conducted
his
business
badly
declared
himself
and
abandoned
his
property
to
his
creditors
with
the
proviso
that
he
retain
a
good
part
of
it
for
himself
be
free
and
reputed
a
very
upright
man
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
to
him
his
bench
was
broken
rotto
banca
he
could
even
in
certain
towns
keep
all
his
property
and
baulk
his
creditors
provided
he
seated
himself
on
a
stone
in
the
presence
of
all
the
merchants
this
was
a
mild
derivation
of
the
old
roman
proverb
aut
in
aere
aut
in
to
pay
either
with
money
or
one
skin
but
this
custom
no
longer
exists
creditors
have
preferred
their
money
to
a
bankrupt
hinder
parts
in
england
and
in
some
other
countries
one
declares
oneself
bankrupt
in
the
gazettes
the
partners
and
creditors
gather
together
by
virtue
of
this
announcement
which
is
read
in
the
and
they
come
to
an
arrangement
as
best
they
can
as
among
the
bankruptcies
there
are
frequently
fraudulent
cases
it
has
been
necessary
to
punish
them
if
they
are
taken
to
court
they
are
everywhere
regarded
as
theft
and
the
guilty
are
condemned
to
ignominious
penalties
it
is
not
true
that
in
france
the
death
penalty
was
decreed
against
bankrupts
without
distinction
simple
failures
involved
no
penalty
fraudulent
bankrupts
suffered
the
penalty
of
death
in
the
states
of
orleans
under
charles
and
in
the
states
of
blois
in
but
these
edicts
renewed
by
henry
were
merely
comminatory
it
is
too
difficult
to
prove
that
a
man
has
dishonoured
himself
on
purpose
and
has
voluntarily
ceded
all
his
goods
to
his
creditors
in
order
to
cheat
them
when
there
has
been
a
doubt
one
has
been
content
with
putting
the
unfortunate
man
in
the
pillory
or
with
sending
him
to
the
galleys
although
ordinarily
a
banker
makes
a
poor
convict
bankrupts
were
very
favourably
treated
in
the
last
year
of
louis
xiv
reign
and
during
the
regency
the
sad
state
to
which
the
interior
of
the
kingdom
was
reduced
the
multitude
of
merchants
who
could
not
or
would
not
pay
the
quantity
of
unsold
or
unsellable
effects
the
fear
of
interrupting
all
commerce
obliged
the
government
in
and
to
suspend
all
proceedings
against
all
those
who
were
in
a
state
of
insolvency
the
discussions
of
these
actions
were
referred
to
the
this
is
a
jurisdiction
of
merchants
very
expert
in
these
cases
and
better
constituted
for
going
into
these
commercial
details
than
the
parliaments
which
have
always
been
more
occupied
with
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
than
with
finance
as
the
state
was
at
that
time
going
bankrupt
it
would
have
been
too
hard
to
punish
the
poor
bankrupts
since
then
we
have
had
eminent
men
fraudulent
bankrupts
but
they
have
not
been
punished
ask
a
toad
what
beauty
is
the
he
will
answer
you
that
it
is
his
toad
wife
with
two
great
round
eyes
issuing
from
her
little
head
a
wide
flat
mouth
a
yellow
belly
a
brown
back
interrogate
a
guinea
negro
for
him
beauty
is
a
black
oily
skin
eyes
a
flat
nose
interrogate
the
devil
he
will
tell
you
that
beauty
is
a
pair
of
horns
four
claws
and
a
tail
consult
lastly
the
philosophers
they
will
answer
you
with
gibberish
they
have
to
have
something
conforming
to
the
of
beauty
in
essence
to
the
one
day
i
was
at
a
tragedy
near
by
a
philosopher
how
beautiful
that
is
he
said
what
do
you
find
beautiful
there
i
asked
it
is
beautiful
he
answered
because
the
author
has
reached
his
goal
the
following
day
he
took
some
medicine
which
did
him
good
the
medicine
has
reached
its
goal
i
said
to
him
what
a
beautiful
medicine
he
grasped
that
one
can
not
say
a
medicine
is
beautiful
and
that
to
give
the
name
of
beauty
to
something
the
thing
must
cause
you
to
admire
it
and
give
you
pleasure
he
agreed
that
the
tragedy
had
inspired
these
sentiments
in
him
and
that
there
was
the
beauty
we
journeyed
to
england
the
same
piece
perfectly
translated
was
played
there
it
made
everybody
in
the
audience
yawn
ho
ho
he
said
the
is
not
the
same
for
the
english
and
the
french
after
much
reflection
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
beauty
is
often
very
relative
just
as
what
is
decent
in
japan
is
indecent
in
rome
and
what
is
fashionable
in
paris
is
not
fashionable
in
pekin
and
he
saved
himself
the
trouble
of
composing
a
long
treatise
on
beauty
there
are
actions
which
the
whole
world
finds
beautiful
two
of
officers
mortal
enemies
send
each
other
a
challenge
not
as
to
who
shall
shed
the
other
blood
with
tierce
and
quarte
behind
a
thicket
as
with
us
but
as
to
who
shall
best
defend
the
roman
camp
which
the
barbarians
are
about
to
attack
one
of
them
having
repulsed
the
enemy
is
near
succumbing
the
other
rushes
to
his
aid
saves
his
life
and
completes
the
victory
a
friend
sacrifices
his
life
for
his
friend
a
son
for
his
father
the
algonquin
the
frenchman
the
chinaman
will
all
say
that
that
is
very
that
these
actions
give
them
pleasure
that
they
admire
them
they
will
say
as
much
of
the
great
moral
maxims
of
zarathustra
in
doubt
if
an
action
be
just
abstain
of
confucius
forget
injuries
never
forget
kindnesses
the
negro
with
the
round
eyes
and
flat
nose
who
will
not
give
the
name
of
beauties
to
the
ladies
of
our
courts
will
without
hesitation
give
it
to
these
actions
and
these
maxims
the
wicked
man
even
will
recognize
the
beauty
of
these
virtues
which
he
dare
not
imitate
the
beauty
which
strikes
the
senses
merely
the
imagination
and
that
which
is
called
intelligence
is
often
uncertain
therefore
the
beauty
which
speaks
to
the
heart
is
not
that
you
will
find
a
host
of
people
who
will
tell
you
that
they
have
found
nothing
beautiful
in
of
the
iliad
but
nobody
will
deny
that
codrus
devotion
to
his
people
was
very
beautiful
supposing
it
to
be
true
there
are
many
other
reasons
which
determine
me
not
to
write
a
treatise
on
beauty
samuel
ornik
native
of
basle
was
as
you
know
a
very
amiable
young
man
who
besides
knew
his
new
testament
by
heart
in
greek
and
german
when
he
was
twenty
his
parents
sent
him
on
a
journey
he
was
charged
to
carry
some
books
to
the
coadjutor
of
paris
at
the
time
of
the
fronde
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
archbishop
residence
the
swiss
told
him
that
monseigneur
saw
nobody
comrade
said
ornik
to
him
you
are
very
rude
to
your
compatriots
the
apostles
let
everyone
approach
and
jesus
christ
desired
that
people
should
suffer
all
the
little
children
to
come
to
him
i
have
nothing
to
ask
of
your
master
on
the
contrary
i
have
brought
him
something
come
inside
then
said
the
swiss
he
waits
an
hour
in
a
first
antechamber
as
he
was
very
naïve
he
began
a
conversation
with
a
servant
who
was
very
fond
of
telling
all
he
knew
of
his
master
he
must
be
mightily
rich
said
ornik
to
have
this
crowd
of
pages
and
flunkeys
whom
i
see
running
about
the
house
i
do
know
what
his
income
is
answered
the
other
but
i
heard
it
said
to
joly
and
the
abbé
charier
that
he
already
had
two
millions
of
debts
but
who
is
that
lady
coming
out
of
the
room
that
is
madame
de
pomereu
one
of
his
mistresses
she
is
really
very
pretty
but
i
have
not
read
that
the
apostles
had
such
company
in
their
bedrooms
in
the
mornings
ah
i
think
the
archbishop
is
going
to
give
audience
say
highness
monseigneur
willingly
ornik
salutes
his
highness
presents
his
books
and
is
received
with
a
very
gracious
smile
the
archbishop
says
four
words
to
him
then
climbs
into
his
coach
escorted
by
fifty
horsemen
in
climbing
monseigneur
lets
a
sheath
fall
ornik
is
quite
astonished
that
monseigneur
carries
so
large
an
in
his
pocket
do
you
see
that
his
dagger
says
the
chatterbox
everyone
carries
a
dagger
when
he
goes
to
parliament
that
a
pleasant
way
of
officiating
says
ornik
and
he
goes
away
very
astonished
he
traverses
france
and
enlightens
himself
from
town
to
town
thence
he
passes
into
italy
when
he
is
in
the
pope
territory
he
meets
one
of
those
bishops
with
a
thousand
crowns
income
walking
on
foot
ornik
was
very
polite
he
offers
him
a
place
in
his
cambiature
you
are
doubtless
on
your
way
to
comfort
some
sick
man
monseigneur
sir
i
am
on
my
way
to
my
master
your
master
that
is
jesus
christ
doubtless
sir
it
is
cardinal
azolin
i
am
his
almoner
he
pays
me
very
poorly
but
he
has
promised
to
place
me
in
the
service
of
donna
olimpia
the
favourite
nostro
what
you
are
in
the
pay
of
a
cardinal
but
do
you
not
know
that
there
were
no
cardinals
in
the
time
of
jesus
christ
and
st
john
is
it
possible
cried
the
italian
prelate
nothing
is
more
true
you
have
read
it
in
the
gospel
i
have
never
read
it
answered
the
bishop
all
i
know
is
our
office
i
tell
you
there
were
neither
cardinals
nor
bishops
and
when
there
were
bishops
the
priests
were
their
equals
almost
according
to
jerome
assertions
in
several
places
holy
virgin
said
the
italian
i
knew
nothing
about
it
and
the
popes
there
were
not
any
popes
any
more
than
cardinals
the
good
bishop
crossed
himself
he
thought
he
was
with
an
evil
spirit
and
jumped
out
of
the
cambiature
you
despise
them
books
you
whose
whole
life
is
plunged
in
the
vanities
of
ambition
and
in
the
search
for
pleasure
or
in
idleness
but
think
that
the
whole
of
the
known
universe
with
the
exception
of
the
savage
races
is
governed
by
books
alone
the
whole
of
africa
right
to
ethiopia
and
nigritia
obeys
the
book
of
the
alcoran
after
having
staggered
under
the
book
of
the
gospel
china
is
ruled
by
the
moral
book
of
confucius
a
greater
part
of
india
by
the
book

if
you
have
a
your
goods
your
honour
your
life
even
depends
on
the
interpretation
of
a
book
which
you
never
read
the
the
sons
of
the
of
are
books
also
but
it
is
with
books
as
with
men
the
very
small
number
play
a
great
part
the
rest
are
mingled
in
the
crowd
who
leads
the
human
race
in
civilized
countries
those
who
know
how
to
read
and
write
you
do
not
know
either
hippocrates
boerhaave
or
sydenham
but
you
put
your
body
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
read
them
you
abandon
your
soul
to
those
who
are
paid
to
read
the
bible
although
there
are
not
fifty
among
them
who
have
read
it
in
its
entirety
with
care
to
such
an
extent
do
books
govern
the
world
that
those
who
command
in
the
city
of
the
scipios
and
the
catos
have
desired
that
the
books
of
their
law
should
be
only
for
them
it
is
their
sceptre
they
have
made
it
a
crime
of
for
their
subjects
to
look
there
without
express
permission
in
other
countries
it
has
been
forbidden
to
think
in
writing
without
letters
patent
there
are
nations
among
whom
thought
is
regarded
purely
as
an
object
of
commerce
the
operations
of
the
human
mind
are
valued
there
only
at
two
sous
the
sheet
in
another
country
the
liberty
of
explaining
oneself
by
books
is
one
of
the
most
inviolable
prerogatives
print
all
that
you
like
under
pain
of
boring
or
of
being
punished
if
you
abuse
too
considerably
your
natural
right
before
the
admirable
invention
of
printing
books
were
rarer
and
more
expensive
than
precious
stones
almost
no
books
among
the
barbarian
nations
until
charlemagne
and
from
him
to
the
french
king
charles
surnamed
the
wise
and
from
this
charles
right
to
françois
ier
there
is
an
extreme
dearth
the
arabs
alone
had
books
from
the
eighth
century
of
our
era
to
the
thirteenth
china
was
filled
with
them
when
we
did
not
know
how
to
read
or
write
copyists
were
much
employed
in
the
roman
empire
from
the
time
of
the
scipios
up
to
the
inundation
of
the
barbarians
the
greeks
occupied
themselves
much
in
transcribing
towards
the
time
of
amyntas
philip
and
alexander
they
continued
this
craft
especially
in
alexandria
this
craft
is
somewhat
ungrateful
the
merchants
always
paid
the
authors
and
the
copyists
very
badly
it
took
two
years
of
assiduous
labour
for
a
copyist
to
transcribe
the
bible
well
on
vellum
what
time
and
what
trouble
for
copying
correctly
in
greek
and
latin
the
works
of
origen
of
clement
of
alexandria
and
of
all
those
other
authors
called
fathers
the
poems
of
homer
were
long
so
little
known
that
pisistratus
was
the
first
who
put
them
in
order
and
who
had
them
transcribed
in
athens
about
five
hundred
years
before
the
era
of
which
we
are
making
use
there
are
not
perhaps
a
dozen
copies
of
the
veidam
and
the
in
the
whole
of
the
east
you
would
not
have
found
a
single
book
in
the
whole
of
russia
in
with
the
exception
of
missals
and
a
few
bibles
in
the
homes
of
aged
men
drunk
on
brandy
people
complain
of
a
surfeit
but
it
is
not
for
readers
to
complain
the
remedy
is
easy
nothing
forces
them
to
read
it
is
not
any
the
more
for
authors
to
complain
those
who
make
the
crowd
must
not
cry
that
they
are
being
crushed
despite
the
enormous
quantity
of
books
how
few
people
read
and
if
one
read
profitably
one
would
see
the
deplorable
follies
to
which
the
common
people
offer
themselves
as
prey
every
day
what
multiplies
books
despite
the
law
of
not
multiplying
beings
unnecessarily
is
that
with
books
one
makes
others
it
is
with
several
volumes
already
printed
that
a
new
history
of
france
or
spain
is
fabricated
without
adding
anything
new
all
dictionaries
are
made
with
dictionaries
almost
all
new
geography
books
are
repetitions
of
geography
books
the
summation
of
thomas
has
produced
two
thousand
fat
volumes
of
theology

empire
on

hungarian
side
who
would
believe
that
this
word
originally
signified
only
a
game
of
bowls
the
people
of
paris
played
bowls
on
the
grass
of
the
rampart
this
grass
was
called
the
like
the
grass
market
boulait
sur
le
from
there
it
comes
that
the
english
whose
language
is
a
copy
of
ours
in
almost
all
the
words
which
are
not
saxon
have
called
the
game
of
bowls
the
green
of
the
game
of
bowls
we
have
taken
back
from
them
what
we
had
lent
them
following
their
example
we
gave
the
name
of
without
knowing
the
strength
of
the
word
to
the
we
introduced
into
our
gardens
i
once
heard
two
good
dames
who
were
going
for
a
walk
on
the
and
not
on
the
people
laughed
at
them
and
wrongly
but
in
all
matters
custom
carries
the
day
and
everyone
who
is
right
against
custom
is
hissed
or
condemned
our
questions
barely
turn
on
geography
but
let
us
be
permitted
to
mark
in
two
words
our
astonishment
about
the
town
of
bourges
the
dictionnaire
de
trévoux
claims
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
towns
of
europe
that
it
was
the
seat
of
the
empire
of
the
gauls
and
gave
kings
to
the
celts
i
do
not
wish
to
combat
the
ancientness
of
any
town
or
any
family
but
was
there
ever
an
empire
of
the
gauls
did
the
celts
have
kings
this
mania
for
antiquity
is
a
malady
from
which
one
will
not
be
healed
so
soon
the
gauls
germany
scandinavia
have
nothing
that
is
antique
save
the
land
the
trees
and
the
animals
if
you
want
antiquities
go
toward
asia
and
even
then
it
is
very
small
beer
man
is
ancient
and
monuments
new
that
is
what
we
have
in
view
in
more
than
one
article
if
it
were
a
real
benefit
to
be
born
in
a
stone
or
wooden
enclosure
more
ancient
than
another
it
would
be
very
reasonable
to
make
the
foundation
of
one
town
date
back
to
the
time
of
the
war
of
the
giants
but
since
there
is
not
the
least
advantage
in
this
vanity
one
must
break
away
from
it
that
is
all
i
had
to
say
about
bourges
is
it
not
probable
that
the
brahmins
were
the
first
legislators
of
the
earth
the
first
philosophers
the
first
theologians
do
not
the
few
monuments
of
ancient
history
which
remain
to
us
form
a
great
presumption
in
their
favour
since
the
first
greek
philosophers
went
to
them
to
learn
mathematics
and
since
the
most
ancient
curiosities
collected
by
the
emperors
of
china
are
all
indian
we
will
speak
elsewhere
of
the
shasta
it
is
the
first
book
of
theology
of
the
brahmins
written
about
fifteen
hundred
years
before
their
veidam
and
anterior
to
all
the
other
books
their
annals
make
no
mention
of
any
war
undertaken
by
them
at
any
time
the
words
for
to
to
are
not
to
be
found
either
in
the
fragments
of
the
shasta
which
we
have
or
in
the
ezourveidam
or
in
the
cormoveidam
i
can
at
least
give
the
assurance
that
i
did
not
see
them
in
these
last
two
collections
and
what
is
still
more
singular
is
that
the
shasta
which
speaks
of
a
conspiracy
in
heaven
makes
no
mention
of
any
war
in
the
great
peninsula
enclosed
between
the
indus
and
the
ganges
the
hebrews
who
were
known
so
late
never
name
the
brahmins
they
had
no
knowledge
of
india
until
after
the
conquests
of
alexander
and
their
settling
in
egypt
of
which
they
had
said
so
much
evil
the
name
of
india
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
book
of
esther
and
in
that
of
job
which
was
not
hebrew
one
remarks
a
singular
contrast
between
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
and
those
of
the
indians
the
indian
books
announce
only
peace
and
gentleness
they
forbid
the
killing
of
animals
the
hebrew
books
speak
only
of
killing
of
the
massacre
of
men
and
beasts
everything
is
slaughtered
in
the
name
of
the
lord
it
is
quite
another
order
of
things
it
is
incontestably
from
the
brahmins
that
we
hold
the
idea
of
the
fall
of
the
celestial
beings
in
revolt
against
the
sovereign
of
nature
and
it
is
from
there
probably
that
the
greeks
drew
the
fable
of
the
titans
it
is
there
also
that
the
jews
at
last
took
the
idea
of
the
revolt
of
lucifer
in
the
first
century
of
our
era
how
could
these
indians
suppose
a
revolt
in
heaven
without
having
seen
one
on
earth
such
a
jump
from
human
nature
to
divine
nature
is
barely
conceivable
usually
one
goes
from
known
to
unknown
one
does
not
imagine
a
war
of
giants
until
one
has
seen
some
men
more
robust
than
the
others
tyrannize
over
their
fellows
the
first
brahmins
must
either
have
experienced
violent
discords
or
at
least
have
seen
them
in
heaven
it
is
a
very
astonishing
phenomenon
for
a
society
of
men
who
have
never
made
war
to
have
invented
a
species
of
war
made
in
the
imaginary
spaces
or
in
a
globe
distant
from
ours
or
in
what
is
called
the
firmament
the
empyrean
but
it
must
be
carefully
observed
that
in
this
revolt
of
celestial
beings
against
their
sovereign
no
blows
were
struck
no
celestial
blood
flowed
no
mountains
hurled
at
the
head
no
angels
cut
in
two
as
in
milton
sublime
and
grotesque
poem
according
to
the
shasta
it
is
only
a
formal
disobedience
to
the
orders
of
the
most
high
a
cabal
which
god
punishes
by
relegating
the
rebellious
angels
to
a
vast
place
of
shadows
called
ondera
during
the
period
of
an
entire
mononthour
a
mononthour
is
four
hundred
and
millions
of
our
years
but
god
deigned
to
pardon
the
guilty
after
five
thousand
years
and
their
ondera
was
only
a
purgatory
he
made
mhurd
of
them
men
and
placed
them
in
our
globe
on
condition
that
they
should
not
eat
animals
and
that
they
should
not
copulate
with
the
males
of
their
new
species
under
pain
of
returning
to
ondera
those
are
the
principal
articles
of
the
brahmins
faith
which
have
lasted
without
interruption
from
immemorial
times
right
to
our
day
it
seems
strange
to
us
that
among
them
it
should
be
as
grave
a
sin
to
eat
a
chicken
as
to
commit
sodomy
this
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
ancient
cosmogony
of
the
brahmins
their
rites
their
pagodas
prove
that
among
them
everything
was
allegorical
they
still
represent
virtue
beneath
the
emblem
of
a
woman
who
has
ten
arms
and
who
combats
ten
mortal
sins
represented
by
monsters
our
missionaries
have
not
failed
to
take
this
image
of
virtue
for
that
of
the
devil
and
to
assure
us
that
the
devil
is
worshipped
in
india
we
have
never
been
among
these
people
but
to
enrich
ourselves
and
to
calumniate
them
really
we
have
forgotten
a
very
essential
thing
in
this
little
article
on
the
brahmins
it
is
that
their
sacred
books
are
filled
with
contradictions
but
the
people
do
not
know
of
them
and
the
doctors
have
solutions
ready
figurative
meanings
allegories
symbols
express
declarations
of
birma
brahma
and
vitsnou
which
should
close
the
mouths
of
all
who
reason
from
the
greek
word
it
is
what
nature
has
graved
in
us
can
one
change
one
character
yes
if
one
changes
one
body
it
is
possible
for
a
man
born
blunderer
unbending
and
violent
being
stricken
with
apoplexy
in
his
old
age
to
become
a
foolish
tearful
child
timid
and
peaceable
his
body
is
no
longer
the
same
but
as
long
as
his
nerves
his
blood
and
his
marrow
are
in
the
same
state
his
nature
will
not
change
any
more
than
a
wolf
and
a
marten
instinct
the
character
is
composed
of
our
ideas
and
our
feelings
well
it
is
substantiated
that
we
give
ourselves
neither
feelings
nor
ideas
therefore
our
character
does
not
depend
on
us
if
it
depended
on
us
there
is
nobody
who
would
not
be
perfect
we
can
not
give
ourselves
tastes
talents
why
should
we
give
ourselves
qualities
if
one
does
not
reflect
one
thinks
oneself
master
of
everything
when
one
reflects
thereon
one
sees
that
one
is
master
of
nothing
should
you
wish
to
change
a
man
character
completely
purge
him
with
diluents
every
day
until
you
have
killed
him
charles
in
his
suppurative
fever
on
the
road
to
bender
was
no
longer
the
same
man
one
prevailed
upon
him
as
upon
a
child

i
have
a
crooked
nose
and
two
cat
eyes
i
can
hide
them
with

can
i
do
more
with
the
character
which
nature
has
given
me
a
man
born
violent
hasty
presented
himself
before
françois

of

to
complain
of
an
injustice
the
prince
countenance
the
respectful
bearing
of
the
courtiers

very
place
where
he
is
make
a
powerful
impression
on
this
man
mechanically
he
lowers
his
eyes
his
rough
voice
softens
he
presents
his
petition
humbly
one
would
believe
him
born
as
gentle
as
are
at
that
moment
at
least
the
courtiers
amongst
whom
he
is
even
disconcerted
but
françois
understands
physiognomy
he
easily
discovers
in
the
lowered
eyes
burning
nevertheless
with
sombre
fire
in
the
strained
facial
muscles
in
the
compressed
lips
that
this
man
is
not
so
gentle
as
he
is
forced
to
appear
this
man
follows
him
to
pavia
is
taken
with
him
led
to
the
same
prison
in
madrid
françois
i
majesty
no
longer
makes
the
same
impression
on
him
he
grows
familiar
with
the
object
of
his
respect
one
day
when
pulling
off
the
king
boots
and
pulling
them
off
badly
the
king
embittered
by
his
misfortune
gets
angry
my
man
sends
the
king
about
his
business
and
throws
his
boots
out
of
the
window
sixtus
was
born
petulant
stubborn
haughty
impetuous
vindictive
arrogant
this
character
seemed
softened
during
the
trials
of
his
novitiate
he
begins
to
enjoy
a
certain
credit
in
his
order
he
flies
into
a
passion
with
a
guard
and
batters
him
with
his
fist
he
is
inquisitor
at
venice
he
performs
his
duties
with
insolence
behold
him
cardinal
he
is
possessed
rabbia
this
fury
triumphs
over
his
nature
he
buries
his
person
and
his
character
in
obscurity
he
apes
the
humble
and
the
dying
man
he
is
elected
pope
this
moment
gives
back
to
the
spring
which
politics
have
bent
all
its
long
curbed

in

they
will
not

there
are
too
many
cattle
in
your

they
will

it
happens
after
this
exhortation
that
the
pikes
eat
half
my

the
wolves
the
half
of
his

on

this
countryman
it
is
you
one
of
your
passions
has
devoured
the
others
and
you
think
you
have
triumphed
over
yourself
do
not
nearly
all
of
us
resemble
that
old
general
of
ninety
who
having
met
some
young
officers
who
were
debauching
themselves
with
some
girls
says
to
them
angrily
gentlemen
is
that
the
example
i
give
you
the
article
entitled
charlatan
in
the
encyclopedic
dictionary
is
filled
with
useful
truths
agreeably
presented
the
chevalier
de
jaucourt
has
there
presented
the
charlatanry
of
medicine
we
will
take
the
liberty
of
adding
here
a
few
reflections
the
abode
of
the
doctors
is
in
the
large
towns
there
are
barely
any
doctors
in
the
country
it
is
in
the
great
towns
that
the
rich
invalids
are
debauchery
the
excesses
of
the
table
the
passions
are
the
cause
of
their
maladies
dumoulin
not
the
lawyer
the
doctor
who
was
as
good
a
practician
as
the
other
said
as
he
was
dying
that
he
left
two
great
doctors
behind
him
diet
and
river
water
in
in
the
time
of
law
the
most
famous
charlatan
of
the
first
species
another
villars
by
name
confided
to
some
friends
that
his
uncle
who
had
lived
nearly
a
hundred
years
and
who
died
only
by
accident
had
left
him
the
secret
of
a
water
which
could
easily
prolong
life
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
provided
a
man
was
temperate
when
he
saw
a
funeral
pass
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
pity
if
the
defunct
he
observed
had
drunk
my
water
he
would
not
be
where
he
is
his
friends
to
whom
he
gave
generously
of
the
water
and
who
observed
the
prescribed
regime
in
some
degree
thrived
on
it
and
praised
it
he
then
sold
the
bottle
for
six
francs
the
sale
was
prodigious
it
was
water
from
the
seine
with
a
little
nitre
those
who
took
it
and
who
subjected
themselves
to
a
certain
amount
of
regime
above
all
those
who
were
born
with
a
good
constitution
recovered
perfect
health
in
a
few
days
he
said
to
the
others
it
is
your
fault
if
you
are
not
entirely
cured
correct
these
two
vices
and
you
will
live
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
some
of
them
reformed
this
good
charlatan
fortune
increased
like
his
reputation
the
abbé
de
pons
the
enthusiast
put
him
far
above
the
maréchal
de
villars
the
maréchal
kills
men
he
said
to
him
but
you
make
them
live
people
learned
at
last
that
villars
water
was
only
river
water
they
would
have
no
more
of
it
and
went
to
other
charlatans
it
is
certain
that
he
had
done
good
and
that
the
only
reproach
one
could
make
against
him
was
that
he
had
sold
seine
water
a
little
too
dear
he
led
men
to
temperance
by
which
fact
he
was
superior
to
the
apothecary
arnoult
who
stuffed
europe
with
his
sachets
against
apoplexy
without
recommending
any
virtue
i
knew
in
london
a
doctor
named
brown
who
practised
in
barbados
he
had
a
sugar
refinery
and
negroes
he
was
robbed
of
a
considerable
sum
he
assembled
his
negroes
my
lads
he
said
to
them
the
great
serpent
appeared
to
me
during
the
night
he
told
me
that
the
thief
would
at
this
moment
have
a
parrot
feather
on
the
end
of
his
nose
the
guilty
man
promptly
put
his
hand
to
his
nose
it
is
you
who
robbed
me
said
the
master
the
great
serpent
has
just
told
me
so
and
he
regained
his
money
one
can
hardly
condemn
such
a
charlatanry
but
one
must
be
dealing
with
negroes
scipio
africanus
this
great
scipio
very
different
otherwise
from
brown
willingly
made
his
soldiers
believe
that
he
was
inspired
by
the
gods
this
great
charlatanry
was
long
the
custom
can
one
blame
scipio
to
have
availed
himself
of
it
he
was
the
man
who
perhaps
did
most
honour
to
the
roman
republic
but
why
did
the
gods
inspire
him
not
to
render
his
accounts
numa
did
better
it
was
necessary
to
police
some
brigands
and
a
senate
which
was
the
most
difficult
section
of
these
brigands
to
govern
if
he
had
proposed
his
laws
to
the
assembled
tribes
the
assassins
of
his
predecessor
would
have
made
a
thousand
difficulties
he
addressed
himself
to
the
goddess
egeria
who
gave
him
some
pandects
from
jupiter
he
was
obeyed
without
contradiction
and
he
reigned
happily
his
instructions
were
good
his
charlatanry
did
good
but
if
some
secret
enemy
had
discovered
the
imposture
if
he
had
said
exterminate
an
impostor
who
prostitutes
the
name
of
the
gods
in
order
to
deceive
men
numa
ran
the
risk
of
being
sent
to
heaven
with
romulus
it
is
probable
that
numa
took
his
measures
very
carefully
and
that
he
deceived
the
romans
for
their
benefit
with
a
dexterity
suitable
to
the
time
the
place
the
intelligence
of
the
early
romans
mahomet
was
twenty
times
on
the
point
of
failing
but
he
succeeded
at
last
with
the
arabs
of
medina
and
people
believed
that
he
was
the
intimate
friend
of
the
archangel
gabriel
if
someone
came
to
constantinople
to
announce
that
he
was
the
favourite
of
the
archangel
raphael
far
superior
to
gabriel
in
dignity
and
that
it
was
in
him
alone
people
should
believe
he
would
be
impaled
in
the
public
place
it
is
for
charlatans
to
choose
their
time
well
was
there
not
a
little
charlatanry
in
socrates
with
his
familiar
demon
and
apollo
precise
declaration
which
proclaimed
him
the
wisest
of
all
men
how
can
rollin
in
his
history
reason
from
this
oracle
how
is
it
that
he
does
not
let
the
young
idea
know
that
it
was
pure
charlatanry
socrates
chose
his
time
badly
a
hundred
years
earlier
maybe
he
would
have
governed
athens
all
leaders
of
sects
in
philosophy
have
been
somewhat
charlatans
but
the
greatest
of
all
have
been
those
who
have
aspired
to
domination
cromwell
was
the
most
terrible
of
all
our
charlatans
he
appeared
at
precisely
the
only
time
he
could
succeed
under
elizabeth
he
would
have
been
hanged
under
charles
ii
he
would
have
been
merely
ridiculous
he
came
happily
at
a
time
when
people
were
disgusted
with
kings
and
his
son
at
a
time
when
people
were
weary
of
a
protector
of
charlatanry
in
science
and
literature
the
sciences
can
barely
be
without
charlatanry
people
wish
to
have
their
opinions
accepted
the
quibbling
doctor
wishes
to
eclipse
the
angelic
doctor
the
recondite
doctor
wishes
to
reign
alone
each
builds
his
system
of
physics
metaphysics
scholastic
theology
it
is
a
competition
in
turning
one
merchandise
to
account
you
have
agents
who
extol
it
fools
who
believe
you
protectors
who
support
you
is
there
a
greater
charlatanry
than
that
of
substituting
words
for
things
and
of
wanting
others
to
believe
what
you
do
not
believe
yourself
one
establishes
whirlwinds
of
subtle
matter
ramous
globulous
striated
channelled
the
other
elements
of
matter
which
are
not
matter
at
all
and
a
harmony
which
makes
the
clock
of
the
body
sound
the
hour
when
the
clock
of
the
soul
shows
it
with
its
hand
these
chimeras
find
partisans
for
a
few
years
when
this
rubbish
has
passed
out
of
fashion
new
fanatics
appear
on
the
itinerant
theatre
they
banish
germs
from
the
world
they
say
that
the
sea
produced
the
mountains
and
that
men
were
once
fish
how
much
charlatanry
has
been
put
into
history
either
by
astonishing
the
reader
with
prodigies
by
titillating
human
malignity
with
satire
or
by
flattering
the
families
of
tyrants
with
infamous
eulogy
the
wretched
species
that
writes
for
a
living
is
charlatan
in
another
way
a
poor
man
who
has
no
trade
who
has
had
the
misfortune
to
go
to
college
and
who
thinks
he
knows
how
to
write
goes
to
pay
his
court
to
a
bookseller
and
asks
him
for
work
the
bookseller
knows
that
the
majority
of
most
people
who
live
in
houses
want
to
have
little
libraries
that
they
need
abridgments
and
new
titles
he
orders
from
the
writer
an
abridgment
of
the
history
by
an
abridgment
of
the
history
of
the
church
a
collection
of
witty
sayings
drawn
from
the
menagiana
a
dictionary
of
great
men
where
an
unknown
pedant
is
placed
beside
cicero
and
a
of
italy
near
virgil
another
bookseller
orders
novels
or
translations
of
novels
if
you
have
no
imagination
he
says
to
the
workman
you
will
take
a
few
of
the
adventures
in
in
in
the
memoirs
of
a
gentleman
of
quality
or
a
lady
of
quality
and
from
the
total
you
will
prepare
a
volume
of
four
hundred
pages
at
twenty
sous
the
sheet
another
bookseller
gives
the
gazettes
and
almanacs
for
ten
years
past
to
a
man
of
genius
you
will
make
me
an
extract
of
all
that
and
you
will
bring
it
me
back
in
three
months
under
the
name
of
history
of
the
times
by
the
chevalier
de
trois
etoiles
lieutenant
of
the
navy
employed
in
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
of
this
kind
of
book
there
are
about
fifty
thousand
in
europe
and
it
all
passes
just
like
the
secret
of
whitening
the
skin
of
darkening
the
hair
and
the
universal
panacea
extract
from
some
notes
found
among
a
lawyer
papers
which
maybe
merit
examination
let
the
punishments
of
criminals
be
useful
a
hanged
man
is
good
for
nothing
and
a
man
condemned
to
public
works
still
serves
the
country
and
is
a
living
lesson
let
all
laws
be
clear
uniform
and
precise
to
interpret
laws
is
almost
always
to
corrupt
them
let
nothing
be
infamous
save
vice
let
taxes
be
always
proportional
let
the
law
never
be
contradictory
to
custom
for
if
the
custom
be
good
the
law
is
worthless
climate
influences
religion
as
regards
customs
and
ceremonies
a
legislator
will
not
have
had
difficulty
in
making
the
indians
bathe
in
the
ganges
at
certain
seasons
of
the
moon
it
is
a
great
pleasure
for
them
he
would
have
been
stoned
if
he
had
proposed
the
same
bath
to
the
peoples
who
dwell
on
the
banks
of
the
dwina
near
archangel
forbid
pig
to
an
arab
who
would
have
leprosy
if
he
ate
of
this
flesh
which
is
very
bad
and
disgusting
in
his
country
he
will
obey
you
joyfully
issue
the
same
veto
to
a
westphalian
and
he
will
be
tempted
to
fight
you
abstinence
from
wine
is
a
good
religious
precept
in
arabia
where
orange
water
lemon
water
lime
water
are
necessary
to
health
mohammed
would
not
have
forbidden
wine
in
switzerland
perhaps
especially
before
going
to
battle
there
are
customs
of
pure
fantasy
why
did
the
priests
of
egypt
imagine
circumcision
it
is
not
for
health
cambyses
who
treated
them
as
they
deserved
they
and
their
bull
apis
cambyses
courtiers
soldiers
had
not
had
their
prepuces
lopped
and
were
very
well
climate
does
nothing
to
a
priest
genitals
one
offered
one
prepuce
to
isis
probably
as
one
presented
everywhere
the
first
fruits
of
the
earth
it
was
offering
the
first
fruits
of
life
religions
have
always
rolled
on
two
pivots
observance
and
creed
observance
depends
largely
on
climate
creed
not
at
all
one
could
as
easily
make
a
dogma
accepted
on
the
equator
as
the
polar
circle
it
would
later
be
rejected
equally
at
batavia
and
in
the
orkneys
while
it
would
be
maintained
et
at
salamanca
that
depends
in
no
way
on
the
soil
and
the
atmosphere
but
solely
on
opinion
that
fickle
queen
of
the
world
certain
libations
of
wine
will
be
precept
in
a
country
and
it
will
not
occur
to
a
legislator
mind
to
institute
in
norway
sacred
mysteries
which
can
not
be
performed
without
wine
it
will
be
expressly
ordered
to
burn
incense
in
the
parvis
of
a
temple
where
beasts
are
slaughtered
in
the
deity
honour
and
for
the
supper
this
butcher
shop
called
temple
would
be
a
place
of
abominable
infection
if
it
were
not
continually
purified
and
without
the
assistance
of
aromatics
the
religion
of
the
ancients
would
have
caused
the
plague
even
the
interior
of
the
temple
was
decked
with
festoons
of
flowers
in
order
to
make
the
air
sweeter
no
cow
will
be
sacrificed
in
the
burning
land
of
the
indian
peninsula
because
this
animal
which
furnishes
necessary
milk
is
very
rare
in
an
arid
country
its
flesh
is
dry
tough
contains
very
little
nourishment
and
the
brahmins
would
live
very
badly
on
the
contrary
the
cow
will
become
sacred
in
view
of
its
rarity
and
utility
one
will
only
enter
barefoot
the
temple
of
jupiter
ammon
where
the
heat
is
excessive
one
must
be
well
shod
to
perform
one
devotions
in
copenhagen
it
is
not
so
with
dogma
people
have
believed
in
polytheism
in
all
climates
and
it
is
as
easy
for
a
crimean
tartar
as
for
an
inhabitant
of
mecca
to
recognize
a
single
god
incommunicable
it
is
through
its
dogma
still
more
than
through
its
rites
that
a
religion
is
spread
from
one
climate
to
another
the
dogma
of
the
unity
of
god
soon
passed
from
medina
to
the
caucasus
then
the
climate
cedes
to
opinion
the
arabs
said
to
the
turks
we
had
ourselves
circumcised
in
arabia
without
really
knowing
why
it
was
an
old
fashion
of
the
priests
of
egypt
to
offer
to
oshireth
or
osiris
a
little
part
of
what
they
held
most
precious
we
had
adopted
this
custom
three
thousand
years
before
we
became
mohammedans
you
will
be
circumcised
like
us
like
us
you
will
be
obliged
to
sleep
with
one
of
your
wives
every
friday
and
to
give
each
year
two
and
a
half
per
cent
of
your
income
to
the
poor
we
drink
only
water
and
sherbet
all
intoxicating
liquor
is
forbidden
us
in
arabia
it
is
pernicious
you
will
embrace
this
regime
although
you
love
wine
passionately
and
although
it
may
even
be
often
necessary
for
you
to
go
on
the
banks
of
the
phasis
and
araxes
lastly
if
you
want
to
go
to
heaven
and
be
well
placed
there
you
will
take
the
road
to
mecca
the
inhabitants
of
the
north
of
the
caucasus
submit
to
these
laws
and
embrace
throughout
the
country
a
religion
which
was
not
made
for
them
in
egypt
the
symbolic
worship
of
animals
succeeded
the
dogmas
of
thaut
the
gods
of
the
romans
later
shared
egypt
with
the
dogs
the
cats
and
the
crocodiles
to
the
roman
religion
succeeded
christianity
it
was
entirely
driven
out
by
mohammedanism
which
perhaps
will
cede
its
place
to
a
new
religion
in
all
these
vicissitudes
climate
has
counted
for
nothing
government
has
done
everything
we
are
considering
here
second
causes
only
without
raising
profane
eyes
to
the
providence
which
directs
them
the
christian
religion
born
in
syria
having
received
its
principal
development
in
alexandria
inhabits
the
lands
where
teutate
irminsul
frida
odin
were
worshipped
there
are
peoples
whose
religion
has
been
made
by
neither
climate
nor
government
what
cause
detached
the
north
of
germany
denmark
of
switzerland
holland
england
scotland
ireland
from
the
roman
communion
poverty
indulgences
and
deliverance
from
purgatory
were
sold
too
dear
to
souls
whose
bodies
had
at
that
time
very
little
money
the
prelates
the
monks
devoured
a
province
whole
revenue
people
took
a
cheaper
religion
at
last
after
twenty
civil
wars
people
believed
that
the
pope
religion
was
very
good
for
great
lords
and
the
reformed
religion
for
citizens
time
will
show
whether
the
greek
religion
or
the
turkish
religion
will
prevail
by
the
ægean
sea
and
the
there
are
sometimes
in
common
expressions
an
image
of
what
passes
in
the
depths
of
all
men
hearts
among
the
romans
signified
not
only
common
sense
but
humanity
sensibility
as
we
are
not
as
good
as
the
romans
this
word
signifies
among
us
only
half
of
what
it
signified
among
them
it
means
only
good
sense
plain
reason
reason
set
in
operation
a
first
notion
of
ordinary
things
a
state
midway
between
stupidity
and
intelligence
this
man
has
no
common
sense
is
a
great
insult
a
man
is
an
insult
likewise
it
means
that
he
is
not
entirely
stupid
and
that
he
lacks
what
is
called
wit
and
understanding
but
whence
comes
this
expression
unless
it
be
from
the
senses
men
when
they
invented
this
word
avowed
that
nothing
entered
the
soul
save
through
the
senses
otherwise
would
they
have
used
the
word
to
signify
common
reasoning
people
say
sometimes
common
sense
is
very
rare
what
does
this
phrase
signify
that
in
many
men
reason
set
in
operation
is
stopped
in
its
progress
by
prejudices
that
such
and
such
man
who
judges
very
sanely
in
one
matter
will
always
be
vastly
deceived
in
another
this
arab
who
will
be
a
good
calculator
a
learned
chemist
an
exact
astronomer
will
believe
nevertheless
that
mohammed
put
half
the
moon
in
his
sleeve
why
will
he
go
beyond
common
sense
in
the
three
sciences
of
which
i
speak
and
why
will
he
be
beneath
common
sense
when
there
is
question
of
this
half
moon
because
in
the
first
cases
he
has
seen
with
his
eyes
he
has
perfected
his
intelligence
and
in
the
second
he
has
seen
with
other
people
eyes
he
has
closed
his
own
he
has
perverted
the
common
sense
which
is
in
him
how
has
this
strange
mental
alienation
been
able
to
operate
how
can
the
ideas
which
move
with
so
regular
and
so
firm
a
step
in
the
brain
on
a
great
number
of
subjects
limp
so
wretchedly
on
another
a
thousand
times
more
palpable
and
easy
to
comprehend
this
man
always
has
inside
him
the
same
principles
of
intelligence
he
must
have
some
organ
vitiated
then
just
as
it
happens
sometimes
that
the
finest
may
have
a
depraved
taste
as
regards
a
particular
kind
of
food
how
is
the
organ
of
this
arab
who
sees
half
the
moon
in
sleeve
vitiated
it
is
through
fear
he
has
been
told
that
if
he
did
not
believe
in
this
sleeve
his
soul
immediately
after
his
death
when
passing
over
the
pointed
bridge
would
fall
for
ever
into
the
abyss
he
has
been
told
even
worse
things
if
ever
you
have
doubts
about
this
sleeve
one
dervish
will
treat
you
as
impious
another
will
prove
to
you
that
you
are
an
insensate
fool
who
having
all
possible
motives
for
believing
have
not
wished
to
subordinate
your
superb
reason
to
the
evidence
a
third
will
report
you
to
the
little
divan
of
a
little
province
and
you
will
be
legally
impaled
all
this
terrifies
the
good
arab
his
wife
his
sister
all
his
little
family
into
a
state
of
panic
they
have
good
sense
about
everything
else
but
on
this
article
their
imagination
is
wounded
as
was
the
imagination
of
pascal
who
continually
saw
a
precipice
beside
his
armchair
but
does
our
arab
believe
in
fact
in
mohammed
sleeve
no
he
makes
efforts
to
believe
he
says
it
is
impossible
but
that
it
is
true
he
believes
what
he
does
not
believe
on
the
subject
of
this
sleeve
he
forms
in
his
head
a
chaos
of
ideas
which
he
is
afraid
to
disentangle
and
this
veritably
is
not
to
have
common
sense
of
the
present
is
delivered
it
is
said
of
the
future
events
are
linked
to
each
other
by
an
invincible
fatality
it
is
destiny
which
in
homer
is
above
even
jupiter
this
master
of
gods
and
men
declares
roundly
that
he
can
not
stop
his
son
sarpedon
dying
in
his
appointed
time
sarpedon
was
born
at
the
moment
when
he
had
to
be
born
and
could
not
be
born
at
another
moment
he
could
not
die
otherwise
than
before
troy
he
could
not
be
buried
elsewhere
than
in
lycia
had
at
the
appointed
time
to
produce
vegetables
which
had
to
be
changed
into
the
substance
of
a
few
lycians
his
heirs
had
to
establish
a
new
order
in
his
states
this
new
order
had
to
exert
an
influence
over
the
neighbouring
kingdoms
from
it
resulted
a
new
arrangement
of
war
and
peace
with
the
neighbours
of
the
neighbours
of
lycia
thus
step
by
step
the
destiny
of
the
whole
world
has
been
dependent
on
sarpedon
death
which
depended
on
helen
being
carried
off
and
this
carrying
off
was
necessarily
linked
to
marriage
which
by
tracing
back
to
other
events
was
linked
to
the
origin
of
things
if
only
one
of
these
facts
had
been
arranged
differently
another
universe
would
have
resulted
but
it
was
not
possible
for
the
present
universe
not
to
exist
therefore
it
was
not
possible
for
jupiter
to
save
his
son
life
for
all
that
he
was
jupiter
this
system
of
necessity
and
fatality
has
been
invented
in
our
time
by
leibnitz
according
to
what
people
say
under
the
name
of
it
is
however
very
ancient
that
there
is
no
effect
without
a
cause
and
that
often
the
smallest
cause
produces
the
greatest
effects
does
not
date
from
lord
bolingbroke
avows
that
the
little
quarrels
of
madame
marlborough
and
madame
masham
gave
birth
to
his
chance
of
making
queen
private
treaty
with
louis
xiv
this
treaty
led
to
the
peace
of
utrecht
this
peace
of
utrecht
established
philip
on
the
throne
of
spain
philip
took
naples
and
sicily
from
the
house
of
austria
the
spanish
prince
who
is
king
of
naples
clearly
owes
his
kingdom
to
my
lady
masham
and
he
would
not
have
had
it
he
would
not
perhaps
even
have
been
born
if
the
duchess
of
marlborough
had
been
more
complaisant
towards
the
queen
of
england
his
existence
at
naples
depended
on
one
foolishness
more
or
less
at
the
court
of
london
examine
the
position
of
all
the
peoples
of
the
universe
they
are
established
like
this
on
a
sequence
of
facts
which
appear
to
be
connected
with
nothing
and
which
are
connected
with
everything
everything
is
cog
pulley
cord
spring
in
this
vast
machine
it
is
likewise
in
the
physical
sphere
a
wind
which
blows
from
the
depths
of
africa
and
the
austral
seas
brings
a
portion
of
the
african
atmosphere
which
falls
in
rain
in
the
valleys
of
the
alps
these
rains
fertilize
our
lands
our
north
wind
in
its
turn
sends
our
vapours
among
the
negroes
we
do
good
to
guinea
and
guinea
does
good
to
us
the
chain
stretches
from
one
end
of
the
universe
to
the
other
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
strange
abuse
is
made
of
the
truth
of
this
principle
from
it
some
people
conclude
that
there
is
not
a
sole
minute
atom
whose
movement
has
not
exerted
its
influence
in
the
present
arrangement
of
the
world
that
there
is
not
a
single
minute
accident
among
either
men
or
animals
which
is
not
an
essential
link
in
the
great
chain
of
fate
let
us
understand
each
other
every
effect
clearly
has
its
cause
going
back
from
cause
to
cause
in
the
abyss
of
eternity
but
every
cause
has
not
its
effect
going
forward
to
the
end
of
the
centuries
all
events
are
produced
by
each
other
i
admit
if
the
past
is
delivered
of
the
present
the
present
is
delivered
of
the
future
everything
has
father
but
everything
has
not
always
children
here
it
is
precisely
as
with
a
genealogical
tree
each
house
goes
back
as
we
say
to
adam
but
in
the
family
there
are
many
persons
who
have
died
without
leaving
issue
there
is
a
genealogical
tree
of
the
events
of
this
world
it
is
incontestable
that
the
inhabitants
of
gaul
and
spain
are
descended
from
gomer
and
the
russians
from
magog
his
younger
brother
one
finds
this
genealogy
in
so
many
fat
books
on
this
basis
one
can
not
deny
that
the
great
turk
who
is
also
descended
from
magog
was
not
bound
to
be
well
beaten
in
by
catherine
empress
of
russia
this
adventure
is
clearly
connected
with
other
great
adventures
but
that
magog
spat
to
right
or
left
near
mount
caucasus
and
that
he
made
two
circles
in
a
well
or
three
that
he
slept
on
the
left
side
or
on
the
right
i
do
not
see
that
that
has
had
much
influence
on
present
affairs
one
must
think
that
everything
is
not
complete
in
nature
as
newton
has
demonstrated
and
that
every
movement
is
not
communicated
step
by
step
until
it
makes
a
circuit
of
the
world
as
he
has
demonstrated
still
further
throw
into
water
a
body
of
like
density
you
calculate
easily
that
after
a
short
time
the
movement
of
this
body
and
the
movement
it
has
communicated
to
the
water
are
destroyed
the
movement
disappears
and
is
effaced
therefore
the
movement
that
magog
might
produce
by
spitting
in
a
well
can
not
influence
what
is
passing
in
moldavia
and
wallachia
therefore
present
events
are
not
the
children
of
all
past
events
they
have
their
direct
lines
but
a
thousand
little
collateral
lines
do
not
serve
them
at
all
once
more
every
being
has
a
father
but
every
being
has
not
children
if
some
literary
society
wishes
to
undertake
the
dictionary
of
contradictions
i
subscribe
for
twenty
folio
volumes
the
world
can
exist
only
by
contradictions
what
is
needed
to
abolish
them
to
assemble
the
states
of
the
human
race
but
from
the
manner
in
which
men
are
made
it
would
be
a
fresh
contradiction
if
they
were
to
agree
assemble
all
the
rabbits
of
the
universe
there
will
not
be
two
different
opinions
among
them
i
know
only
two
kinds
of
immutable
beings
on
the
earth
mathematicians
and
animals
they
are
led
by
two
invariable
rules
demonstration
and
instinct
and
even
the
mathematicians
have
had
some
disputes
but
the
animals
have
never
varied
the
contrasts
the
light
and
shade
in
which
public
men
are
represented
in
history
are
not
contradictions
they
are
faithful
portraits
of
human
nature
every
day
people
condemn
and
admire
alexander
the
murderer
of
clitus
but
the
avenger
of
greece
the
conqueror
of
the
persians
and
the
founder
of
alexandria
cæsar
the
debauchee
who
robs
the
public
treasury
of
rome
to
reduce
his
country
to
dependence
but
whose
clemency
equals
his
valour
and
whose
intelligence
equals
his
courage
mohammed
impostor
brigand
but
the
sole
religious
legislator
who
had
courage
and
who
founded
a
great
empire
cromwell
the
enthusiast
a
rogue
in
his
fanaticism
even
judicial
assassin
of
his
king
but
as
profound
politician
as
brave
warrior
a
thousand
contrasts
frequently
crowd
together
and
these
contrasts
are
in
nature
they
are
no
more
astonishing
than
a
fine
day
followed
by
storm
men
are
equally
mad
everywhere
they
have
made
the
laws
little
by
little
as
gaps
are
repaired
in
a
wall
here
eldest
sons
have
taken
all
they
could
from
younger
sons
there
younger
sons
share
equally
sometimes
the
church
has
commanded
the
duel
sometimes
she
has
anathematized
it
the
partisans
and
the
enemies
of
aristotle
have
each
been
excommunicated
in
their
turn
as
have
those
who
wore
long
hair
and
those
who
wore
short
in
this
world
we
have
perfect
law
only
to
rule
a
species
of
madness
called
gaming
the
rules
of
gaming
are
the
only
ones
which
admit
neither
exception
relaxation
variety
nor
tyranny
a
man
who
has
been
a
lackey
if
he
play
at
lansquenet
with
kings
is
paid
without
difficulty
if
he
win
everywhere
else
the
law
is
a
sword
with
which
the
stronger
cut
the
weaker
in
pieces
nevertheless
this
world
exists
as
if
everything
were
well
ordered
the
irregularity
is
of
our
nature
our
political
world
is
like
our
globe
a
misshapen
thing
which
always
preserves
itself
it
would
be
mad
to
wish
that
the
mountains
the
seas
the
rivers
were
traced
in
beautiful
regular
forms
it
would
be
still
more
mad
to
ask
perfect
wisdom
of
men
it
would
be
wishing
to
give
wings
to
dogs
or
horns
to
eagles
the
gauls
had
corn
in
cæsar
time
one
is
curious
to
know
where
they
and
the
teutons
found
it
to
sow
people
answer
you
that
the
tyrians
had
brought
it
into
spain
the
spaniards
into
gaul
the
gauls
into
germany
and
where
did
the
tyrians
get
this
corn
among
the
greeks
probably
from
whom
they
received
it
in
exchange
for
their
alphabet
who
had
made
this
present
to
the
greeks
it
was
formerly
ceres
without
a
doubt
and
when
one
has
gone
back
to
ceres
one
can
hardly
go
farther
ceres
must
have
come
down
on
purpose
from
the
sky
to
give
us
wheat
rye
barley
etc
but
as
the
credit
of
ceres
who
gave
the
corn
to
the
greeks
and
that
of
isheth
or
isis
who
bestowed
it
on
the
egyptians
is
very
much
fallen
in
these
days
we
remain
in
uncertainty
as
to
the
origin
of
corn
sanchoniathon
affirms
that
dagon
or
dagan
one
of
the
grandsons
of
thaut
had
the
control
of
corn
in
phoenicia
well
his
thaut
is
of
about
the
same
time
as
our
jared
from
this
it
results
that
corn
is
very
old
and
that
it
is
of
the
same
antiquity
as
grass
perhaps
this
dagon
was
the
first
man
to
make
bread
but
that
is
not
demonstrated
strange
thing
we
know
positively
that
it
is
to
noah
that
we
are
under
an
obligation
for
wine
and
we
do
not
know
to
whom
we
owe
bread
and
still
more
strange
thing
we
are
so
ungrateful
to
noah
that
we
have
more
than
two
thousand
songs
in
honour
of
bacchus
and
we
chant
barely
one
in
honour
of
noah
our
benefactor
a
jew
has
assured
me
that
corn
came
by
itself
in
mesopotamia
like
the
apples
wild
pears
chestnuts
medlars
in
the
west
i
want
to
believe
it
until
i
am
sure
of
the
contrary
for
corn
must
certainly
grow
somewhere
it
has
become
the
ordinary
and
indispensable
food
in
the
good
climates
and
throughout
the
north
some
great
philosophers
whose
talents
we
esteem
and
whose
systems
we
do
not
follow
buffon
have
claimed
on
page
of
the
natural
history
of
the
dog
that
mankind
has
made
corn
that
our
fathers
by
virtue
of
sowing
lolium
and
gramina
changed
them
into
wheat
as
these
philosophers
are
not
of
our
opinion
about
shells
they
will
permit
us
not
to
be
of
theirs
about
corn
we
do
not
believe
that
one
has
ever
made
tulips
grow
from
jasmin
we
find
that
the
germ
of
corn
is
quite
different
from
that
of
lolium
and
we
do
not
believe
in
any
transmutation
when
somebody
shows
it
to
us
we
will
retract
corn
assuredly
is
not
the
food
of
the
greater
part
of
the
world
maize
tapioca
feed
the
whole
of
america
we
have
entire
provinces
where
the
peasants
eat
nothing
but
chestnut
bread
more
nourishing
and
of
better
flavour
than
that
of
rye
and
barley
which
so
many
people
eat
and
which
is
much
better
than
the
ration
bread
which
is
given
to
the
soldier
the
whole
of
southern
africa
does
not
know
of
bread
the
immense
archipelago
of
the
indies
siam
laos
pegu
cochin
china
tonkin
a
part
of
china
japan
the
coast
of
malabar
and
coromandel
the
banks
of
the
ganges
furnish
a
rice
the
cultivation
of
which
is
much
easier
than
that
of
wheat
and
which
causes
it
to
be
neglected
corn
is
absolutely
unknown
for
the
space
of
fifteen
hundred
leagues
on
the
coasts
of
the
glacial
sea
this
food
to
which
we
are
accustomed
is
among
us
so
precious
that
the
fear
of
seeing
a
dearth
of
it
alone
causes
riots
among
the
most
subjugated
peoples
the
corn
trade
is
everywhere
one
of
the
great
objects
of
government
it
is
a
part
of
our
being
and
yet
this
essential
commodity
is
sometimes
squandered
ridiculously
the
powder
merchants
use
the
best
flour
for
covering
the
heads
of
our
young
men
and
women
but
over
of
the
earth
bread
is
not
eaten
at
all
people
maintain
that
the
ethiopians
mocked
at
the
egyptians
who
lived
on
bread
but
since
it
is
our
chief
food
corn
has
become
one
of
the
great
objects
of
trade
and
politics
so
much
has
been
written
on
this
subject
that
if
a
husbandman
sowed
as
much
corn
as
the
weight
of
the
volumes
we
have
about
this
commodity
he
might
hope
for
the
amplest
harvest
and
become
richer
than
those
who
in
their
gilded
and
lacquered
ignore
his
exceeding
labour
and
wretchedness
section
i
cromwell
is
painted
as
a
man
who
was
an
impostor
all
his
life
i
have
difficulty
in
believing
it
i
think
that
first
of
all
he
was
an
enthusiast
and
that
later
he
made
even
his
fanaticism
serve
his
greatness
a
novice
who
is
fervent
at
the
age
of
twenty
often
becomes
a
skilful
rogue
at
forty
in
the
great
game
of
human
life
one
begins
by
being
a
dupe
and
one
finishes
by
being
a
rogue
a
statesman
takes
as
almoner
a
monk
steeped
in
the
pettinesses
of
his
monastery
devout
credulous
clumsy
quite
new
to
the
world
the
monk
learns
forms
himself
intrigues
and
supplants
his
master
cromwell
did
not
know
at
first
whether
he
would
be
an
ecclesiastic
or
a
soldier
he
was
both
in
he
served
a
campaign
in
the
army
of
frederick
henry
prince
of
orange
a
great
man
brother
of
two
great
men
and
when
he
returned
to
england
he
went
into
the
service
of
bishop
williams
and
was
his
grace
theologian
while
his
grace
passed
as
his
wife
lover
his
principles
were
those
of
the
puritans
thus
he
had
to
hate
a
bishop
with
all
his
heart
and
not
have
a
liking
for
kings
he
was
driven
from
bishop
williams
house
because
he
was
a
puritan
and
there
is
the
origin
of
his
fortune
the
english
parliament
declared
itself
against
the
throne
and
against
the
episcopacy
some
of
his
friends
in
this
parliament
procured
the
nomination
of
a
village
for
him
only
at
this
time
did
he
begin
to
exist
and
he
was
more
than
forty
before
he
had
ever
made
himself
talked
of
in
vain
was
he
conversant
with
holy
writ
in
vain
did
he
argue
about
the
rights
of
priests
and
deacons
and
preach
a
few
poor
sermons
and
libels
he
was
ignored
i
have
seen
one
of
his
sermons
which
is
very
insipid
and
which
bears
sufficient
resemblance
to
the
predications
of
the
quakers
assuredly
there
is
to
be
found
there
no
trace
of
that
persuasive
eloquence
with
which
later
he
carried
the
parliaments
away
the
reason
is
that
in
fact
he
was
much
more
suited
to
public
affairs
than
to
the
church
it
was
above
all
in
his
tone
and
in
his
air
that
his
eloquence
consisted
a
gesture
of
that
hand
that
had
won
so
many
battles
and
killed
so
many
royalists
was
more
persuasive
than
the
periods
of
cicero
it
must
be
avowed
that
it
was
his
incomparable
bravery
which
made
him
known
and
which
led
him
by
degrees
to
the
pinnacle
of
greatness
he
began
by
launching
out
as
a
volunteer
who
wished
to
make
his
fortune
in
the
town
of
hull
besieged
by
the
king
there
he
did
many
fine
and
happy
actions
for
which
he
received
a
gratification
of
about
six
thousand
francs
from
the
parliament
this
present
made
by
the
parliament
to
an
adventurer
made
it
clear
that
the
rebel
party
must
prevail
the
king
was
not
in
a
position
to
give
to
his
general
officers
what
the
parliament
gave
to
volunteers
with
money
and
fanaticism
one
is
bound
in
the
long
run
to
be
master
of
everything
cromwell
was
made
colonel
then
his
great
talents
for
war
developed
to
the
point
that
when
the
parliament
created
the
count
of
manchester
general
of
its
armies
it
made
cromwell
without
his
having
passed
through
the
other
ranks
never
did
man
appear
more
worthy
of
commanding
never
were
more
activity
and
prudence
more
boldness
and
more
resource
seen
than
in
cromwell
he
is
wounded
at
the
battle
of
york
and
while
the
first
dressing
is
being
put
on
his
wound
he
learns
that
his
general
manchester
is
retiring
and
that
the
battle
is
lost
he
hastens
to
manchester
side
he
finds
him
fleeing
with
some
officers
he
takes
him
by
the
arm
and
says
to
him
with
an
air
of
confidence
and
grandeur
you
are
mistaken
my
lord
it
is
not
on
this
side
that
the
enemy
is
he
leads
him
back
near
the
battlefield
rallies
during
the
night
more
than
twelve
thousand
men
speaks
to
them
in
the
name
of
god
quotes
moses
gideon
and
joshua
at
daybreak
recommences
the
battle
against
the
victorious
royal
army
and
defeats
it
completely
such
a
man
had
to
perish
or
be
master
nearly
all
the
officers
of
his
army
were
enthusiasts
who
carried
the
new
testament
at
their
in
the
army
as
in
the
parliament
men
spoke
only
of
making
babylon
fall
of
establishing
the
religion
in
jerusalem
of
shattering
the
colossus
among
so
many
madmen
cromwell
ceased
to
be
mad
and
thought
that
it
was
better
to
govern
them
than
to
be
governed
by
them
the
habit
of
preaching
as
though
he
were
inspired
remained
to
him
picture
a
fakir
who
has
put
an
iron
belt
round
his
waist
as
a
penitence
and
who
then
takes
off
his
belt
to
beat
the
other
fakirs
ears
there
you
have
cromwell
he
becomes
as
intriguing
as
he
was
intrepid
he
associates
himself
with
all
the
colonels
of
the
army
and
thus
forms
among
the
troops
a
republic
which
forces
the
to
resign
another
is
nominated
he
disgusts
him
he
governs
the
army
and
by
it
he
governs
the
parliament
he
puts
this
parliament
in
the
necessity
of
making
him
at
last
all
this
was
a
great
deal
but
what
is
essential
is
that
he
wins
all
the
battles
he
engages
in
in
england
scotland
and
ireland
and
he
wins
them
not
in
watching
the
fighting
and
in
taking
care
of
himself
but
always
by
charging
the
enemy
rallying
his
troops
rushing
everywhere
often
wounded
killing
many
royalist
officers
with
his
own
hand
like
a
desperate
and
infuriated
grenadier
amid
this
frightful
war
cromwell
made
love
he
went
his
bible
under
his
arm
to
sleep
with
the
wife
of
his
lambert
she
loved
the
count
of
holland
who
was
serving
in
the
king
army
cromwell
took
him
prisoner
in
a
battle
and
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
having
his
head
cut
off
his
maxim
was
to
shed
the
blood
of
every
important
enemy
either
on
the
field
of
battle
or
by
the
executioner
hand
he
always
increased
his
power
by
always
daring
to
abuse
it
the
profundity
of
his
plans
took
away
nothing
from
his
ferocious
impetuosity
he
goes
into
the
house
of
parliament
and
taking
his
watch
which
he
threw
on
the
ground
and
which
he
shattered
to
atoms
i
will
break
you
he
said
like
this
watch
he
returns
there
some
time
after
drives
all
the
members
out
one
after
the
other
making
them
defile
before
him
each
is
obliged
as
he
passes
to
make
him
a
deep
bow
one
of
them
passes
with
his
hat
on
his
head
cromwell
takes
his
hat
from
him
and
throws
it
on
the
ground
learn
to
respect
me
he
says
when
he
had
outraged
all
kings
by
having
his
own
legitimate
king
head
cut
off
and
when
he
started
to
reign
himself
he
sent
his
portrait
to
a
crowned
head
it
was
to
christine
queen
of
sweden
marvell
a
famous
english
poet
who
wrote
very
good
latin
verse
accompanied
this
portrait
with
six
verses
where
he
made
cromwell
himself
speak
cromwell
corrected
the
last
two
as
follows
tibi
submittit
frontem
reverentior
umbra
non
sunt
hi
vultus
regibus
usque
this
queen
was
the
first
to
recognize
him
as
soon
as
he
was
protector
of
the
three
kingdoms
almost
all
the
sovereigns
of
europe
sent
their
ambassadors
their
cromwell
to
this
bishop
servant
who
had
just
caused
a
sovereign
their
own
kin
to
perish
at
the
hand
of
the
executioner

vied
with
each
in
soliciting
his
alliance
cardinal
mazarin
to
please
him
drove
out
of
france
the
two
sons
of
charles
the
two
grandsons
of
henry
the
two
first
cousins
of
louis
xiv
france
conquered
dunkirk
for
him
and
sent
him
the
keys
after
his
death
louis
xiv
and
all
his
court
wore
mourning
excepting
mademoiselle
who
had
the
courage
to
come
to
the
company
in
a
coloured
habit
and
alone
maintained
the
honour
of
her
race
never
was
a
king
more
absolute
than
he
was
he
said
that
he
had
preferred
governing
under
the
name
of
rather
than
under
that
of
because
the
english
knew
the
point
to
which
a
king
of
england
prerogative
extended
and
did
not
know
to
what
point
a
protector
might
go
that
was
to
understand
men
who
are
governed
by
opinion
and
whose
opinion
depends
on
a
name
he
had
conceived
a
profound
scorn
for
the
religion
which
had
served
to
his
fortune
there
is
a
certain
anecdote
preserved
in
the
house
of
john
which
proves
sufficiently
the
little
account
which
cromwell
made
of
the
instrument
which
had
produced
such
great
effects
in
his
hands
he
was
drinking
one
day
with
ireton
fleetwood
and
john
of
the
celebrated
lord
bolingbroke
they
wished
to
uncork
a
bottle
and
the
corkscrew
fell
under
the
table
they
all
looked
for
it
and
did
not
find
it
meanwhile
a
deputation
from
the
presbyterian
churches
was
waiting
in
the
antechamber
and
an
usher
came
to
announce
them
tell
them
said
cromwell
that
i
have
retired
that
i
am
seeking
the
it
was
the
expression
which
the
fanatics
used
when
they
were
saying
their
prayers
when
he
had
thus
dismissed
the
band
of
ministers
he
said
these
very
words
to
his
confidants
those
puppies
think
that
we
are
seeking
the
lord
and
we
are
only
seeking
the
corkscrew
there
is
barely
an
example
in
europe
of
any
man
who
come
from
so
low
raised
himself
so
high
but
what
was
absolutely
essential
to
him
with
all
his
talents
fortune
he
had
this
fortune
but
was
he
happy
he
lived
poorly
and
anxiously
until
he
was
from
that
time
he
bathed
himself
in
blood
passed
his
life
in
turmoil
and
died
before
his
time
at
the
age
of
let
us
compare
this
life
with
that
of
newton
who
lived
years
always
tranquil
always
honoured
always
the
light
of
all
thinking
beings
seeing
increase
each
day
his
renown
his
reputation
his
fortune
without
ever
having
either
care
or
remorse
and
let
us
judge
which
of
the
two
had
the
better
part
section
ii
oliver
cromwell
was
regarded
with
admiration
by
the
puritans
and
independents
of
england
he
is
still
their
hero
but
richard
cromwell
his
son
is
my
man
the
first
is
a
fanatic
who
would
be
hissed
in
the
house
of
commons
if
he
uttered
there
one
single
one
of
the
unintelligible
absurdities
which
he
gave
out
with
so
much
confidence
before
other
fanatics
who
listened
to
him
and
in
the
name
of
the
lord
if
he
said
that
one
must
seek
the
lord
and
fight
the
battles
if
he
introduced
the
jewish
jargon
into
the
parliament
of
england
to
the
eternal
shame
of
the
human
intelligence
he
would
be
nearer
to
being
led
to
bedlam
than
to
being
chosen
to
command
armies
he
was
brave
without
a
doubt
so
are
wolves
there
are
even
monkeys
as
fierce
as
tigers
from
being
a
fanatic
he
became
an
adroit
politician
that
is
to
say
that
from
a
wolf
he
became
fox
climbed
by
imposture
from
the
first
steps
where
the
infuriated
enthusiasm
of
the
times
had
placed
him
right
to
the
pinnacle
of
greatness
and
the
impostor
walked
on
the
heads
of
the
prostrated
fanatics
he
reigned
but
he
lived
in
the
horrors
of
anxiety
he
knew
neither
serene
days
nor
tranquil
nights
the
consolations
of
friendship
and
society
never
approached
him
he
died
before
his
time
more
worthy
without
a
doubt
of
execution
than
the
king
whom
he
had
conducted
from
a
window
of
his
own
palace
to
the
scaffold
richard
cromwell
on
the
contrary
born
with
a
gentle
wise
spirit
refused
to
keep
his
father
crown
at
the
price
of
the
blood
of
two
or
three
rebels
whom
he
could
sacrifice
to
his
ambition
he
preferred
to
be
reduced
to
private
life
rather
than
be
an
omnipotent
assassin
he
left
the
protectorate
without
regret
to
live
as
a
citizen
free
and
tranquil
in
the
country
he
enjoyed
health
there
and
there
did
he
possess
his
soul
in
peace
for
years
loved
by
his
neighbours
to
whom
he
was
arbiter
and
father
readers
give
your
verdict
if
you
had
to
choose
between
the
destiny
of
the
father
and
that
of
the
son
which
would
you
take
contemptible
customs
do
not
always
suppose
a
contemptible
nation
there
are
cases
where
one
must
not
judge
a
nation
by
its
customs
and
popular
superstitions
i
suppose
that
cæsar
having
conquered
egypt
wanting
to
make
trade
flourish
in
the
roman
empire
has
sent
an
embassy
to
china
by
the
port
of
arsinoë
the
red
sea
and
the
indian
ocean
the
emperor
yventi
first
of
his
name
was
then
reigning
the
annals
of
china
represent
him
as
a
very
wise
and
learned
prince
after
receiving
cæsar
ambassadors
with
all
the
chinese
politeness
he
informs
himself
secretly
through
his
interpreters
of
the
customs
science
and
religion
of
this
roman
people
as
celebrated
in
the
west
as
the
chinese
people
is
in
the
east
he
learns
first
of
all
that
this
people
pontiffs
have
arranged
their
year
in
so
absurd
a
fashion
that
the
sun
has
already
the
heavenly
signs
of
spring
when
the
romans
are
celebrating
the
first
festivals
of
winter
he
learns
that
this
nation
supports
at
great
cost
a
college
of
priests
who
know
exactly
the
time
when
one
should
set
sail
and
when
one
should
give
battle
by
inspecting
an
ox
liver
or
by
the
way
in
which
the
chickens
eat
barley
this
sacred
science
was
brought
formerly
to
the
romans
by
a
little
god
named
tages
who
emerged
from
the
earth
in
tuscany
these
peoples
worship
one
supreme
god
whom
they
always
call
the
very
great
and
very
good
god
nevertheless
they
have
built
a
temple
to
a
courtesan
named
flora
and
almost
all
the
good
women
of
rome
have
in
their
homes
little
household
gods
four
or
five
inches
high
one
of
these
little
divinities
is
the
goddess
of
the
breasts
the
other
the
goddess
of
the
buttocks
there
is
a
household
god
who
is
called
the
god
pet
the
emperor
yventi
starts
laughing
the
tribunals
of
nankin
think
first
of
all
with
him
that
the
roman
ambassadors
are
madmen
or
impostors
who
have
taken
the
title
of
envoys
of
the
roman
republic
but
as
the
emperor
is
as
just
as
he
is
polite
he
has
private
talks
with
the
ambassadors
he
learns
that
the
roman
pontiffs
have
been
very
ignorant
but
that
cæsar
is
now
reforming
the
calendar
they
admit
to
him
that
the
college
of
augurs
was
established
in
early
barbarous
times
that
this
ridiculous
institution
become
dear
to
a
people
long
uncivilized
has
been
allowed
to
subsist
that
all
honest
people
laugh
at
the
augurs
that
cæsar
has
never
consulted
them
that
according
to
a
very
great
man
named
cato
never
has
an
augur
been
able
to
speak
to
his
comrade
without
laughter
and
that
finally
cicero
the
greatest
orator
and
the
best
philosopher
in
rome
has
just
written
against
the
augurs
a
little
work
entitled
of
divination
in
which
he
commits
to
eternal
ridicule
all
the
soothsayers
all
the
predictions
and
all
the
sorcery
of
which
the
world
is
infatuated
the
emperor
of
china
is
curious
to
read
book
the
interpreters
translate
it
he
admires
the
book
and
the
roman
republic
ordinarily
there
is
no
comparison
between
the
crimes
of
the
great
who
are
always
ambitious
and
the
crimes
of
the
people
who
always
want
and
can
want
only
liberty
and
equality
these
two
sentiments
liberty
and
equality
do
not
lead
direct
to
calumny
rapine
assassination
poisoning
the
devastation
of
one
neighbours
lands
etc
but
ambitious
might
and
the
mania
for
power
plunge
into
all
these
crimes
whatever
be
the
time
whatever
be
the
place
popular
government
is
in
itself
therefore
less
iniquitous
less
abominable
than
despotic
power
the
great
vice
of
democracy
is
certainly
not
tyranny
and
cruelty
there
have
been
republicans
savage
ferocious
but
it
is
not
the
republican
spirit
that
made
them
so
it
is
nature
the
real
vice
of
a
civilized
republic
is
in
the
turkish
fable
of
the
dragon
with
many
heads
and
the
dragon
with
many
tails
the
many
heads
hurt
each
other
and
the
many
tails
obey
a
single
head
which
wants
to
devour
everything
democracy
seems
suitable
only
to
a
very
little
country
and
further
it
must
be
happily
situated
small
though
it
be
it
will
make
many
mistakes
because
it
will
be
composed
of
men
discord
will
reign
there
as
in
a
monastery
but
there
will
be
no
bartholomew
no
irish
massacres
no
sicilian
vespers
no
inquisition
no
condemnation
to
the
galleys
for
having
taken
some
water
from
the
sea
without
paying
for
it
unless
one
supposes
this
republic
composed
of
devils
in
a
corner
of
hell
one
questions
every
day
whether
a
republican
government
is
preferable
to
a
king
government
the
dispute
ends
always
by
agreeing
that
to
govern
men
is
very
difficult
the
jews
had
god
himself
for
master
see
what
has
happened
to
them
on
that
account
nearly
always
have
they
been
beaten
and
slaves
and
do
you
not
find
that
they
cut
a
pretty
figure
of
all
the
books
of
the
occident
which
have
come
down
to
us
the
most
ancient
is
homer
it
is
there
that
one
finds
the
customs
of
profane
antiquity
of
the
gross
heroes
of
the
gross
gods
made
in
the
image
of
men
but
it
is
there
that
among
the
reveries
and
inconsequences
one
finds
too
the
seeds
of
philosophy
and
above
all
the
idea
of
the
destiny
which
is
master
of
the
gods
as
the
gods
are
masters
of
the
world
when
the
magnanimous
hector
wishes
absolutely
to
fight
the
magnanimous
achilles
and
with
this
object
starts
fleeing
with
all
his
might
and
three
times
makes
the
circuit
of
the
city
before
fighting
in
order
to
have
more
vigour
when
homer
compares
achilles
who
pursues
him
to
a
man
who
sleeps
when
madame
dacier
goes
into
ecstasies
of
admiration
over
the
art
and
mighty
sense
of
this
passage
then
jupiter
wants
to
save
great
hector
who
has
made
so
many
sacrifices
to
him
and
he
consults
the
fates
he
weighs
the
destinies
of
hector
and
achilles
in
the
balance
iliad
liv
xxii
he
finds
that
the
trojan
must
absolutely
be
killed
by
the
greek
he
can
not
oppose
it
and
from
this
moment
apollo
hector
guardian
genius
is
forced
to
abandon
him
it
is
not
that
homer
is
not
often
prodigal
and
particularly
in
this
place
of
quite
contrary
ideas
following
the
privilege
of
antiquity
but
he
is
the
first
in
whom
one
finds
the
notion
of
destiny
this
notion
therefore
was
very
much
in
vogue
in
his
time
the
pharisees
among
the
little
jewish
people
did
not
adopt
destiny
until
several
centuries
later
for
these
pharisees
themselves
who
were
the
first
literates
among
the
jews
were
very
new
fangled
in
alexandria
they
mixed
a
part
of
the
dogmas
of
the
stoics
with
the
old
jewish
ideas
jerome
claims
even
that
their
sect
is
not
much
anterior
to
the
christian
era
the
philosophers
never
had
need
either
of
homer
or
the
pharisees
to
persuade
themselves
that
everything
happens
through
immutable
laws
that
everything
is
arranged
that
everything
is
a
necessary
effect
this
is
how
they
argued
either
the
world
exists
by
its
own
nature
by
its
physical
laws
or
a
supreme
being
has
formed
it
according
to
his
supreme
laws
in
both
cases
these
laws
are
immutable
in
both
cases
everything
is
necessary
heavy
bodies
tend
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
without
being
able
to
tend
to
pause
in
the
air
can
never
bear
pineapples
a
spaniel
instinct
can
not
be
an
ostrich
instinct
everything
is
arranged
in
gear
limited
man
can
have
only
a
certain
number
of
teeth
hair
and
ideas
there
comes
a
time
when
he
necessarily
loses
his
teeth
hair
and
ideas
it
would
be
a
contradiction
that
what
was
yesterday
was
not
that
what
is
is
not
it
is
also
a
contradiction
that
what
must
be
can
not
be
if
you
could
disturb
the
destiny
of
a
fly
there
would
be
no
reason
that
could
stop
your
making
the
destiny
of
all
the
other
flies
of
all
the
other
animals
of
all
men
of
all
nature
you
would
find
yourself
in
the
end
more
powerful
than
god
imbeciles
say
my
doctor
has
extricated
my
aunt
from
a
mortal
malady
he
has
made
my
aunt
live
ten
years
longer
than
she
ought
to
have
lived
others
who
affect
knowledge
say
the
prudent
man
makes
his
own
destiny
but
often
the
prudent
far
from
making
their
destinies
succumb
to
them
it
is
destiny
which
makes
them
prudent
profound
students
of
politics
affirm
that
if
cromwell
ludlow
ireton
and
a
dozen
other
parliamentarians
had
been
assassinated
a
week
before
charles
i
head
was
cut
off
this
king
might
have
lived
longer
and
died
in
his
bed
they
are
right
they
can
add
further
that
if
the
whole
of
england
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
sea
this
monarch
would
not
have
perished
on
a
scaffold
near
whitehall
but
things
were
arranged
so
that
charles
had
to
have
his
neck
severed
cardinal
was
doubtless
more
prudent
than
a
madman
in
bedlam
but
is
it
not
clear
that
the
organs
of
the
sage
were
made
otherwise
than
those
of
the
just
as
a
fox
organs
are
different
from
a
stork
and
a
lark
your
doctor
saved
your
aunt
but
assuredly
he
did
not
in
that
contradict
nature
order
he
followed
it
it
is
clear
that
your
aunt
could
not
stop
herself
being
born
in
such
and
such
town
that
she
could
not
stop
herself
having
a
certain
malady
at
a
particular
time
that
the
doctor
could
not
be
elsewhere
than
in
the
town
where
he
was
that
your
aunt
had
to
call
him
that
he
had
to
prescribe
for
her
the
drugs
which
cured
her
or
which
one
thinks
cured
her
when
nature
was
the
only
doctor
a
peasant
thinks
that
it
has
hailed
on
his
field
by
chance
but
the
philosopher
knows
that
there
is
no
chance
and
that
it
was
impossible
in
the
constitution
of
this
world
for
it
not
to
hail
on
that
day
in
that
place
there
are
persons
who
frightened
by
this
truth
admit
half
of
it
as
debtors
who
offer
half
to
their
creditors
and
ask
respite
for
the
rest
there
are
they
say
some
events
which
are
necessary
and
others
which
are
not
it
would
be
very
comic
that
one
part
of
the
world
was
arranged
and
that
the
other
were
not
that
a
part
of
what
happens
had
to
happen
and
that
another
part
of
what
happens
did
not
have
to
happen
if
one
looks
closely
at
it
one
sees
that
the
doctrine
contrary
to
that
of
destiny
is
absurd
but
there
are
many
people
destined
to
reason
badly
others
not
to
reason
at
all
others
to
persecute
those
who
reason
some
say
to
you
do
not
believe
in
fatalism
for
then
everything
appearing
inevitable
you
will
work
at
nothing
you
will
wallow
in
indifference
you
will
love
neither
riches
nor
honours
nor
glory
you
will
not
want
to
acquire
anything
you
will
believe
yourself
without
merit
as
without
power
no
talent
will
be
cultivated
everything
will
perish
through
apathy
be
not
afraid
gentlemen
we
shall
ever
have
passions
and
prejudices
since
it
is
our
destiny
to
be
subjected
to
prejudices
and
passions
we
shall
know
that
it
no
more
depends
on
us
to
have
much
merit
and
great
talent
than
to
have
a
good
head
of
hair
and
beautiful
hands
we
shall
be
convinced
that
we
must
not
be
vain
about
anything
and
yet
we
shall
always
have
vanity
i
necessarily
have
the
passion
for
writing
this
and
you
have
the
passion
for
condemning
me
both
of
us
are
equally
fools
equally
the
toys
of
destiny
your
nature
is
to
do
harm
mine
is
to
love
truth
and
to
make
it
public
in
spite
of
you
the
owl
which
feeds
on
mice
in

to
the
nightingale
finish
singing

beautiful
shady
trees
come
into
my
hole
that
i
may
eat
you
and
the
nightingale
answered
i
was
born
to
sing
here
and
to
laugh
at
you
you
ask
me
what
will
become
of
liberty
i
do
not
understand
you
i
do
not
know
what
this
liberty
is
of
which
you
speak
so
long
have
you
been
disputing
about
its
nature
that
assuredly
you
are
not
acquainted
with
it
if
you
wish
or
rather
if
you
are
able
to
examine
peaceably
with
me
what
it
is
pass
to
the
letter
the
word
devout
signifies
devoted
and
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
this
qualification
should
belong
only
to
monks
and
nuns
who
make
vows
but
as
in
the
gospel
there
is
no
more
mention
of
vows
than
of
devout
persons
this
title
does
not
in
fact
belong
to
anyone
everyone
should
be
equally
righteous
a
man
who
styles
himself
devout
resembles
a
commoner
who
styles
himself
a
marquis
he
arrogates
to
himself
a
quality
he
does
not
possess
he
thinks
himself
more
worthy
than
his
neighbour
one
can
forgive
such
foolishness
in
women
their
frailty
and
their
frivolity
render
them
excusable
the
poor
creatures
pass
from
a
lover
to
a
director
in
good
faith
but
one
can
not
pardon
the
rogues
who
direct
them
who
abuse
their
ignorance
who
establish
the
throne
of
their
pride
on
the
credulity
of
the
sex
they
resolve
themselves
into
a
little
mystic
seraglio
composed
of
seven
or
eight
aged
beauties
subdued
by
the
weight
of
their
lack
of
occupation
and
almost
always
do
these
persons
pay
tribute
to
their
new
masters
no
young
woman
without
a
lover
no
aged
devout
woman
without
a
director
oh
the
orientals
are
wiser
than
we
are
never
does
a
pasha
say
we
supped
yesterday
with
the
aga
of
the
janissaries
who
is
my
sister
lover
and
the
vicar
of
the
mosque
who
is
my
wife
director
ecclesiastical
the
institution
of
religion
exists
only
to
keep
mankind
in
order
and
to
make
men
merit
the
goodness
of
god
by
their
virtue
everything
in
a
religion
which
does
not
tend
towards
this
goal
must
be
considered
foreign
or
dangerous
instruction
exhortation
menaces
of
pains
to
come
promises
of
immortal
beatitude
prayers
counsels
spiritual
help
are
the
only
means
ecclesiastics
may
use
to
try
to
make
men
virtuous
here
below
and
happy
for
eternity
all
other
means
are
repugnant
to
the
liberty
of
the
reason
to
the
nature
of
the
soul
to
the
inalterable
rights
of
the
conscience
to
the
essence
of
religion
and
of
the
ecclesiastical
ministry
to
all
the
rights
of
the
sovereign
virtue
supposes
liberty
as
the
carrying
of
a
burden
supposes
active
force
under
coercion
no
virtue
and
without
virtue
no
religion
make
a
slave
of
me
i
shall
be
no
better
for
it
the
sovereign
even
has
no
right
to
use
coercion
to
lead
men
to
religion
which
supposes
essentially
choice
and
liberty
my
thought
is
subordinate
to
authority
no
more
than
is
sickness
or
health
in
order
to
disentangle
all
the
contradictions
with
which
books
on
canon
law
have
been
filled
and
to
fix
our
ideas
on
the
ecclesiastical
ministry
let
us
investigate
amid
a
thousand
equivocations
what
the
church
is
the
church
is
the
assembly
of
all
the
faithful
summoned
on
certain
days
to
pray
in
common
and
at
all
times
to
do
good
actions
the
priests
are
persons
established
under
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
to
direct
these
prayers
and
all
religious
worship
a
numerous
church
could
not
exist
without
ecclesiastics
but
these
ecclesiastics
are
not
the
church
it
is
no
less
evident
that
if
the
ecclesiastics
who
are
part
of
civil
society
had
acquired
rights
which
might
trouble
or
destroy
society
these
rights
ought
to
be
suppressed
it
is
still
more
evident
that
if
god
has
attached
to
the
church
prerogatives
or
rights
neither
these
rights
nor
these
prerogatives
should
belong
exclusively
either
to
the
chief
of
the
church
or
to
the
ecclesiastics
because
they
are
not
the
church
just
as
the
magistrates
are
not
the
sovereign
in
either
a
democratic
state
or
in
a
monarchy
finally
it
is
quite
evident
that
it
is
our
souls
which
are
under
the
clergy
care
solely
for
spiritual
things
our
soul
acts
internally
internal
acts
are
thought
volition
inclinations
acquiescence
in
certain
truths
all
these
acts
are
above
all
coercion
and
are
within
the
ecclesiastical
minister
sphere
only
in
so
far
as
he
must
instruct
and
never
command
this
soul
acts
also
externally
external
actions
are
under
the
civil
law
here
coercion
may
have
a
place
temporal
or
corporal
pains
maintain
the
law
by
punishing
those
who
infringe
it
obedience
to
ecclesiastical
order
must
consequently
always
be
free
and
voluntary
no
other
should
be
possible
submission
on
the
other
hand
to
civil
order
may
be
coerced
and
compulsory
for
the
same
reason
ecclesiastical
punishments
always
spiritual
do
not
reach
here
below
any
but
those
who
are
convinced
inwardly
of
their
fault
civil
pains
on
the
contrary
accompanied
by
a
physical
ill
have
their
physical
effects
whether
or
no
the
guilty
recognize
their
justice
from
this
it
results
obviously
that
the
authority
of
the
clergy
is
and
can
be
spiritual
only
that
it
should
not
have
any
temporal
power
that
no
coercive
force
is
proper
to
its
ministry
which
would
be
destroyed
by
it
it
follows
from
this
further
that
the
sovereign
careful
not
to
suffer
any
partition
of
his
authority
must
permit
no
enterprise
which
puts
the
members
of
society
in
external
and
civil
dependence
on
an
ecclesiastical
body
such
are
the
incontestable
principles
of
real
canon
law
of
which
the
rules
and
decisions
should
be
judged
at
all
times
by
the
eternal
and
immutable
truths
which
are
founded
on
natural
law
and
the
necessary
order
of
society
in
antiquity
everything
is
symbol
or
emblem
in
chaldea
it
starts
by
putting
a
ram
two
kids
a
bull
in
the
sky
to
mark
the
productions
of
the
earth
in
the
spring
fire
is
the
symbol
of
the
deity
in
persia
the
celestial
dog
warns
the
egyptians
of
the
nile
floods
the
serpent
which
hides
its
tail
in
its
head
becomes
the
image
of
eternity
the
whole
of
nature
is
represented
and
disguised
in
india
again
you
find
many
of
those
old
statues
uncouth
and
frightful
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
representing
virtue
provided
with
ten
great
arms
with
which
to
combat
vice
and
which
our
poor
missionaries
have
taken
for
the
picture
of
the
devil
put
all
these
symbols
of
antiquity
before
the
eyes
of
a
man
of
the
soundest
sense
who
has
never
heard
speak
of
them
he
will
not
understand
anything
it
is
a
language
to
be
learned
the
old
theological
poets
were
in
the
necessity
of
giving
god
eyes
hands
feet
of
announcing
him
in
the
form
of
a
man
clement
of
alexandria
records
some
verses
of
xenophanes
the
colophonian
stromates
liv
from
which
one
sees
that
it
is
not
merely
from
that
men
have
made
god
in
their
own
image
orpheus
of
thrace
the
first
theologian
of
the
greeks
long
before
homer
expresses
himself
similarly
according
to
the
same
clement
of
alexandria
everything
being
symbol
and
emblem
the
philosophers
and
especially
those
who
had
travelled
in
india
employed
this
method
their
precepts
were
emblems
and
enigmas
not
stir
the
fire
with
a
that
is

not
irritate
angry
men
not

light
under

not

etc
such
are
the
maxims
of
pythagoras
the
sense
of
which
is
not
hard
to
understand
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
emblems
is
that
of
god
whom
timæus
of
locres
represents
by
this
idea
circle
the
centre
of
which
is
everywhere
and
the
circumference
plato
adopted
this
emblem
pascal
had
inserted
it
among
the
material
which
he
intended
using
and
which
has
been
called
his
thoughts
in
metaphysics
in
moral
philosophy
the
ancients
have
said
everything
we
coincide
with
them
or
we
repeat
them
all
modern
books
of
this
kind
are
only
repetitions
it
is
above
all
among
the
indians
the
egyptians
the
syrians
that
these
emblems
which
to
us
appear
most
strange
were
consecrated
it
is
there
that
the
two
organs
of
generation
the
two
symbols
of
life
were
carried
in
procession
with
the
greatest
respect
we
laugh
at
it
we
dare
treat
these
peoples
as
barbarous
idiots
because
they
innocently
thanked
god
for
having
given
them
existence
what
would
they
have
said
if
they
had
seen
us
enter
our
temples
with
the
instrument
of
destruction
at
our
side
at
thebes
the
sins
of
the
people
were
represented
by
a
goat
on
the
coast
of
phoenicia
a
naked
woman
with
a
fish
tail
was
the
emblem
of
nature
one
must
not
be
astonished
therefore
if
this
use
of
symbols
reached
the
hebrews
when
they
had
formed
a
body
of
people
near
the
syrian
desert
one
of
the
most
beautiful
emblems
of
the
judaic
books
is
this
passage
of
ecclesiastes
when
the
grinders
cease
because
they
are
few
and
those
that
look
out
of
the
windows
be
darkened
when
the
shall
flourish
and
the
grasshopper
shall
be
a
burden
or
ever
the
silver
cord
be
loosed
or
the
golden
bowl
be
broken
or
the
pitcher
be
broken
at
the
fountain
that
signifies
that
the
old
men
lose
their
teeth
that
their
sight
is
dim
that
their
hair
whitens
like
the
flower
of
the
that
their
feet
swell
like
the
grasshopper
that
they
are
no
more
fit
for
engendering
children
and
that
then
they
must
prepare
for
the
great
journey
the
song
of
songs
is
as
one
knows
a
continual
emblem
of
the
marriage
of
jesus
christ
with
the
church
it
is
an
emblem
from
beginning
to
end
especially
does
the
ingenious
dom
calmet
demonstrate
that
the
to
which
the
goes
is
the
cross
to
which
our
lord
jesus
christ
was
condemned
but
it
must
be
avowed
that
a
pure
and
healthy
moral
philosophy
is
still
preferable
to
these
allegories
one
sees
in
this
people
books
a
crowd
of
typical
emblems
which
revolt
us
and
which
exercise
our
incredulity
and
our
mockery
but
which
appeared
ordinary
and
simple
to
the
asiatic
peoples
in
ezekiel
are
images
which
appear
to
us
as
licentious
and
revolting
in
those
times
they
were
merely
natural
there
are
thirty
examples
in
the
song
of
songs
model
of
the
most
chaste
union
remark
carefully
that
these
expressions
these
images
are
always
quite
serious
and
that
in
no
book
of
this
distant
antiquity
will
you
find
the
least
mockery
on
the
great
subject
of
generation
when
lust
is
condemned
it
is
in
definite
terms
but
never
to
excite
to
passion
nor
to
make
the
smallest
pleasantry
this
antiquity
did
not
have
its
martial
its
catullus
or
its
petronius
it
results
from
all
the
jewish
prophets
and
from
all
the
jewish
books
as
from
all
the
books
which
instruct
us
in
the
usages
of
the
chaldeans
the
persians
the
phoenicians
the
syrians
the
indians
the
egyptians
it
results
i
say
that
their
customs
were
not
ours
that
this
ancient
world
in
no
way
resembled
our
world
go
from
gibraltar
to
mequinez
merely
the
manners
are
no
longer
the
same
no
longer
does
one
find
the
same
ideas
two
leagues
of
sea
have
changed
everything
the
english
i
have
cast
my
eyes
on
an
edition
of
shakespeare
issued
by
master
samuel
johnson
i
saw
there
that
foreigners
who
are
astonished
that
in
the
plays
of
the
great
shakespeare
a
roman
senator
plays
the
buffoon
and
that
a
king
appears
on
the
stage
drunk
are
treated
as
i
do
not
desire
to
suspect
master
johnson
of
being
a
sorry
jester
and
of
being
too
fond
of
wine
but
i
find
it
somewhat
extraordinary
that
he
counts
buffoonery
and
drunkenness
among
the
beauties
of
the
tragic
stage
and
no
less
singular
is
the
reason
he
gives
that
the
poet
disdains
accidental
distinctions
of
circumstance
and
country
like
a
painter
who
content
with
having
painted
the
figure
neglects
the
drapery
the
comparison
would
be
more
just
if
he
were
speaking
of
a
painter
who
in
a
noble
subject
should
introduce
ridiculous
grotesques
should
paint
alexander
the
great
mounted
on
an
ass
in
the
battle
of
arbela
and
darius
wife
drinking
at
an
inn
with
rapscallions
but
there
is
one
thing
more
extraordinary
than
all
that
is
that
shakespeare
is
a
genius
the
italians
the
french
the
men
of
letters
of
all
other
countries
who
have
not
spent
some
time
in
england
take
him
only
for
a
clown
for
a
joker
far
inferior
to
harlequin
for
the
most
contemptible
buffoon
who
has
ever
amused
the
populace
nevertheless
it
is
in
this
same
man
that
one
finds
pieces
which
exalt
the
imagination
and
which
stir
the
heart
to
its
depths
it
is
truth
it
is
nature
herself
who
speaks
her
own
language
with
no
admixture
of
artifice
it
is
of
the
sublime
and
the
author
has
in
no
wise
sought
it
what
can
one
conclude
from
this
contrast
of
grandeur
and
sordidness
of
sublime
reason
and
uncouth
folly
in
short
from
all
the
contrasts
that
we
see
in
shakespeare
that
he
would
have
been
a
perfect
poet
had
he
lived
in
the
time
of
addison
the
famous
addison
who
flourished
under
queen
anne
is
perhaps
of
all
english
writers
the
one
who
best
knew
how
to
guide
genius
with
taste
he
had
a
correct
style
an
imagination
discreet
in
expression
elegance
strength
and
simplicity
in
his
verse
and
in
his
prose
a
friend
of
propriety
and
orderliness
he
wanted
tragedy
to
be
written
with
dignity
and
it
is
thus
that
his
cato
is
composed
from
the
very
first
act
the
verses
are
worthy
of
virgil
and
the
sentiments
worthy
of
cato
there
is
no
theatre
in
europe
where
the
scene
of
juba
and
syphax
was
not
applauded
as
a
masterpiece
of
skill
of
characters
of
fine
contrasts
and
of
pure
and
noble
diction
literary
europe
which
knows
the
translations
of
this
piece
applauded
even
to
the
philosophic
traits
with
which
the
rôle
of
cato
is
filled
the
piece
had
the
great
success
which
its
beauty
of
detail
merited
and
which
was
assured
to
it
by
the
troubles
in
england
to
which
this
tragedy
was
in
more
than
one
place
a
striking
allusion
but
the
appositeness
of
these
allusions
having
passed
the
verse
being
only
beautiful
the
maxims
being
only
noble
and
just
and
the
piece
being
cold
people
no
longer
felt
anything
more
than
the
coldness
nothing
is
more
beautiful
than
virgil
second

people
soon
returned
to
shakespeare
uncouth
but
captivating
aberrations
one
knows
well
enough
what
antiquity
has
said
of
this
shameful
passion
and
what
the
moderns
have
repeated
hesiod
is
the
first
classic
author
who
speaks
of
it
the
potter

envious
of
the

the

of

the
poor

even
of
the
poor

if
one
would
give
another
sense

the
word
the
poet

poet
long
before
hesiod
job
had
said
envy

silly

chap
verse
i
think
that
mandeville
author
of
the
fable
of
the
bees
was
the
first
to
try
to
prove
that
envy
is
a
very
good
thing
a
very
useful
passion
his
first
reason
is
that
envy
is
as
natural
to
man
as
hunger
and
thirst
that
it
can
be
found
in
children
as
well
as
in
horses
and
dogs
do
you
want
your
children
to
hate
each
other
kiss
one
more
than
the
other
the
secret
is
infallible
he
maintains
that
the
first
thing
that
two
young
women
meeting
each
other
do
is
to
cast
about
for
what
is
ridiculous
in
each
other
and
the
second
to
flatter
each
other
he
believes
that
without
envy
the
arts
would
be
indifferently
cultivated
and
that
raphael
would
not
have
been
a
great
painter
if
he
had
not
been
jealous
of
michael
angelo
mandeville
has
taken
emulation
for
envy
maybe
maybe
also
emulation
is
only
envy
kept
within
the
bounds
of
decency
michael
angelo
might
say
to
raphael
your
envy
has
only
led
you
to
work
still
better
than
me
you
have
not
decried
me
you
have
not
intrigued
against
me
with
the
pope
you
have
not
tried
to
have
me
excommunicated
for
having
put
cripples
and
men
in
paradise
and
succulent
cardinals
with
beautiful
women
naked
as
your
hand
in
hell
in
my
picture
of
the
last
judgment
your
envy
is
very
praiseworthy
you
are
a
fine
envious
fellow
let
us
be
good
friends
but
if
the
envious
man
is
a
wretch
without
talent
jealous
of
merit
as
beggars
are
of
the
rich
if
pressed
by
the
indigence
as
by
the
turpitude
of
his
character
he
writes
you
some
news
from
parnassus
some
letters
of
madame
la
comtesse
some
années
littéraires
this
animal
displays
an
envy
that
is
good
for
nothing
and
for
which
mandeville
could
never
make
an
apology
one
asks
why
the
ancients
thought
that
the
eye
of
the
envious
man
bewitched
those
who
looked
at
it
it
is
the
envious
rather
who
are
bewitched
descartes
says
that
envy
impels
the
yellow
bile
which
comes
from
the
lower
part
of
the
liver
and
the
black
bile
which
comes
from
the
spleen
which
is
diffused
from
the
heart
through
the
arteries
etc
but
as
no
kind
of
bile
is
formed
in
the
spleen
descartes
by
speaking
thus
does
not
seem
to
merit
too
much
that
his
natural
philosophy
should
be
envied
a
certain
voët
or
voëtius
a
theological
scamp
who
accused
descartes
of
atheism
was
very
ill
with
the
black
bile
but
he
knew
still
less
than
descartes
how
his
detestable
bile
was
diffused
in
his
blood
madame
pernelle
is
right
the
envious
will
die
but
envy
never
tartufe
act

but
it
is
good
proverb
which
says
that
it
is
better
to
be
envious
than
to
have
pity

us
be
envious
therefore
as
hard
as

faculties

be
if
man
could
find
everywhere
in

an

that

if
the

would
then
be

chimera
an
absurdity
of
which
no
one
would
think
for
why
seek
servants
when
you
have
no
need
of
their
service
if
it
came
into
the
head
of
some
individual
of
tyrannous
mind
and
brawny
arm
to
enslave
a
neighbour
less
strong

the
thing
would
be
impossible
the
oppressed
would
be
on

the
oppressor
had
taken
his
measures
on

all

would
then
be
necessarily
equal
if
they
were
without
needs
the
poverty
connected
with
our
species
subordinates
one
man
to
another
it
is
not
the
inequality
which
is
the
real
misfortune
it
is
the
dependence
it
matters
very
little
that
calls
himself
his
highness
and
his
holiness
but
to
serve
the
one
or
the
other
is
hard

thankless
and
rebellious

two
poor
families

to
serve
the
opulent
family

slaughter

is
no
difficulty
in
that
one
of
the
two
indigent
families
offers
its
arms
to
the
rich
family
in
order
to
have
bread
the
other
goes
to
attack
it
and
is
beaten
the
serving
family
is
the
origin
of
the
servants

the
workmen
the
beaten
family
is
the
origin
of
the
slaves
in
our
unhappy
world

is
impossible
for
men
living
in
society
not
to
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
one
the
rich
that
commands
the
other
the
poor
that
serves

the
peasants
in
germany
england
and
france
all
these
wars
finish
sooner
or
later
with
the
subjection
of
the
people
because
the
powerful
have
money
and
money
is
master
of
everything
in
a
state
i
say
in
a
state
for
it
is
not
the
same
between
nations
the
nation
which
makes
the
best
use
of
the
sword
will
always
subjugate
the
nation
which
has
more
gold
and
less
courage
all
men
are
born
with
a
sufficiently
violent
liking
for
domination
wealth
and
pleasure
and
with
much
taste
for
idleness
consequently
all
men
want
their
money
and
the
wives
or
daughters
of
others
to
be
their
master
to
subject
them
to
all
their
caprices
and
to
do
nothing
or
at
least
to
do
only
very
agreeable
things
you
see
clearly
that
with
these
fine
inclinations
it
is
as
impossible
for
men
to
be
equal
as
it
is
impossible
for
two
predicants
or
two
professors
of
theology
not
to
be
jealous
of
each
other
the
human
race
such
as
it
is
can
not
subsist
unless
there
is
an
infinity
of
useful
men
who
possess
nothing
at
all
for
it
is
certain
that
a
man
who
is
well
off
will
not
leave
his
own
land
to
come
to
till
yours
and
if
you
have
need
of
a
pair
of
shoes
it
is
not
the
secretary
to
the
privy
council
who
will
make
them
for
you
equality
therefore
is
at
once
the
most
natural
thing
and
the
most
fantastic
as
men
go
to
excess
in
everything
when
they
can
this
inequality
has
been
exaggerated
it
has
been
maintained
in
many
countries
that
it
was
not
permissible
for
a
citizen
to
leave
the
country
where
chance
has
caused
him
to
be
born
the
sense
of
this
law
is
visibly
this
land
is
so
bad
and
so
badly
governed
that
we
forbid
any
individual
to
leave
it
for
fear
that
everyone
will
leave
it
do
better
make
all
your
subjects
want
to
live
in
your
country
and
foreigners
to
come
to
it
all
men
have
the
right
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
to
think
themselves
entirely
equal
to
other
men
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
the
cardinal
cook
should
order
his
master
to
prepare
him
his
dinner
but
the
cook
can
say
i
am
a
man
like
my
master
like
him
i
was
born
crying
like
me
he
will
die
with
the
same
pangs
and
the
same
ceremonies
both
of
us
perform
the
same
animal
functions
if
the
turks
take
possession
of
rome
and
if
then
i
am
cardinal
and
my
master
cook
i
shall
take
him
into
my
service
this
discourse
is
reasonable
and
just
but
while
waiting
for
the
great
turk
to
take
possession
of
rome
the
cook
must
do
his
duty
or
else
all
human
society
is
perverted
as
regards
a
man
who
is
neither
a
cardinal
cook
nor
endowed
with
any
other
employment
in
the
state
as
regards
a
private
person
who
is
connected
with
nothing
but
who
is
vexed
at
being
received
everywhere
with
an
air
of
being
patronized
or
scorned
who
sees
quite
clearly
that
many
have
no
more
knowledge
wit
or
virtue
than
he
and
who
at
times
is
bored
at
waiting
in
their
antechambers
what
should
he
decide
to
do
why
to
take
himself
off
maybe
the
most
beautiful
institution
of
antiquity
is
that
solemn
ceremony
which
repressed
crimes
by
warning
that
they
must
be
punished
and
which
calmed
the
despair
of
the
guilty
by
making
them
atone
for
their
transgressions
by
penitences
remorse
must
necessarily
have
preceded
the
expiations
for
the
maladies
are
older
than
the
medicine
and
all
needs
have
existed
before
relief
it
was
therefore
before
all
the
creeds
a
natural
religion
which
troubled
man
heart
when
in
his
ignorance
or
in
his
hastiness
he
had
committed
an
inhuman
action
a
friend
killed
his
friend
in
a
quarrel
a
brother
killed
his
brother
a
jealous
and
frantic
lover
even
killed
her
without
whom
he
could
not
live
the
head
of
a
nation
condemned
a
virtuous
man
a
useful
citizen
these
are
men
in
despair
if
they
have
sensibility
their
conscience
harries
them
nothing
is
more
true
and
it
is
the
height
of
unhappiness
only
two
choices
remain
either
reparation
or
a
settling
in
crime
all
sensitive
souls
choose
the
first
monsters
choose
the
second
as
soon
as
religions
were
established
there
were
expiations
the
ceremonies
accompanying
them
were
ridiculous
for
what
connection
between
the
water
of
the
ganges
and
a
murder
how
could
a
man
repair
a
homicide
by
bathing
himself
we
have
already
remarked
this
excess
of
aberration
and
absurdity
of
imagining
that
he
who
washes
his
body
washes
his
soul
and
wipes
away
the
stains
of
bad
actions
the
water
of
the
nile
had
later
the
same
virtue
as
the
water
of
the
ganges
to
these
purifications
other
ceremonies
were
added
i
avow
that
they
were
still
more
impertinent
the
egyptians
took
two
goats
and
drew
lots
for
which
of
the
two
should
be
thrown
below
charged
with
the
sins
of
the
guilty
the
name
of
hazazel
the
expiator
was
given
to
this
goat
what
connection
i
ask
you
between
a
goat
and
a
man
crime
it
is
true
that
since
god
permitted
this
ceremony
to
be
sanctified
among
the
jews
our
fathers
who
took
so
many
egyptian
rites
but
doubtless
it
was
the
repentance
and
not
the
goat
which
purified
the
jewish
souls
jason

killed
absyrthe
his
comes
it
is
said
with
medea
more
guilty
than
he
to
have
himself
absolved
by
circe
queen
and
priestess
of
aea
who
ever
after
passed
for
a
great
magician
circe
absolves
them
with
a

salt
cakes
that
may
make
a
fairly
good
dish
but
can
barely
either
pay
for
absyrthe
blood
or
render
jason

more
honourable
people
unless
they
avow
a
sincere
repentance
while
eating
their
orestes
expiation
he
had
avenged
his
father
by
murdering
his
mother
was
to
go
to
steal
a
statue
from
the
tartars
of
crimea
the
statue
must
have
been
very
badly
made
and
there
was
nothing
to
gain
on
such
an
effect
since
then
we
have
done
better
we
have
invented
the
mysteries
the
guilty
might
there
receive
their
absolution
by
undergoing
painful
ordeals
and
by
swearing
that
they
would
lead
a
new
life
it
is
from
this
oath
that
the
new
members
were
called
among
all
nations
by
a
name
which
corresponds
to
initiates
ineunt
vitam
who
began
a
new
career
who
entered
into
the
path
of
virtue
the
christian
catechumens
were
called
only
when
they
were
baptised
it
is
undoubted
that
in
these
mysteries
one
was
washed
of
one
faults
only
by
the
oath
to
be
virtuous
that
is
so
true
that
the
hierophant
in
all
the
greek
mysteries
in
sending
away
the
assembly
pronounced
these
two
egyptian
words
watch
be
pure
which
is
a
proof
at
once
that
the
mysteries
came
originally
from
egypt
and
that
they
were
invented
only
to
make
men
better
the
sages
in
all
times
did
what
they
could
therefore
to
inspire
virtue
and
not
to
reduce
human
frailty
to
despair
but
also
there
are
crimes
so
horrible
that
no
mystery
accorded
expiation
for
them
nero
for
all
that
he
was
emperor
could
not
get
himself
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
ceres
constantine
on
the
report
of
zosimus
could
not
obtain
pardon
for
his
crimes
he
was
stained
with
the
blood
of
his
wife
his
son
and
all
his
kindred
it
was
in
the
interest
of
the
human
race
that
such
great
transgressions
should
remain
without
expiation
in
order
that
absolution
should
not
invite
their
committal
and
that
universal
horror
might
sometimes
stop
the
villains
the
roman
catholics
have
expiations
which
are
called
penitences
by
the
laws
of
the
barbarians
who
destroyed
the
roman
empire
crimes
were
expiated
with
money
that
was
called
cum
decem
viginti
triginta
it
cost
two
hundred
sous
of
that
time
to
kill
a
priest
and
four
hundred
for
killing
a
bishop
so
that
a
bishop
was
worth
precisely
two
priests
having
thus
compounded
with
men
one
compounded
with
god
when
confession
was
generally
established
finally
pope
john
who
made
money
out
of
everything
prepared
a
tariff
of
sins
the
absolution
of
an
incest
four
turonenses
for
a
layman
incestu
pro
laico
in
foro
conscientiæ
turonenses
for
the
man
and
the
woman
who
have
committed
incest
eighteen
turonenses
four
ducats
and
nine
carlins
that
is
not
just
if
one
person
pays
only
four
turonenses
the
two
owed
only
eight
turonenses
sodomy
and
bestiality
are
put
at
the
same
rate
with
the
inhibitory
clause
to
title
xliii
that
amounts
to
ninety
turonenses
twelve
ducats
and
six
carlins
inhibitione
turonenses
ducatos
carlinos
it
is
very
difficult
to
believe
that
leo
was
so
imprudent
as
to
have
this
impost
printed
in
as
is
asserted
but
it
must
be
considered
that
no
spark
appeared
at
that
time
of
the
conflagration
which
reformers
kindled
later
that
the
court
of
rome
slumbered
on
the
credulity
and
neglected
to
cover
its
exactions
with
the
lightest
veil
the
public
sale
of
indulgences
which
followed
soon
after
makes
it
clear
that
this
court
took
no
precaution
to
hide
the
turpitudes
to
which
so
many
nations
were
accustomed
as
soon
as
complaints
against
the
church
abuses
burst
forth
the
court
did
what
it
could
to
suppress
the
book
but
it
could
not
succeed
if
i
dare
give
my
opinion
of
this
impost
i
think
that
the
various
editions
are
not
reliable
the
prices
are
not
at
all
proportionate
these
prices
do
not
agree
with
those
which
are
alleged
by
grandfather
of
madame
de
maintenon
in
the
confession
de
sanci
he
rates
virginity
at
six
and
incest
with
his
mother
and
sister
at
five
this
account
is
ridiculous
i
think
that
there
was
in
fact
a
tariff
established
in
the
datary
office
for
those
who
came
to
rome
to
be
absolved
or
to
bargain
for
dispensations
but
that
the
enemies
of
rome
added
much
to
it
in
order
to
render
it
more
odious
what
is
quite
certain
is
that
these
imposts
were
never
authorized
by
any
council
that
it
was
an
enormous
abuse
invented
by
avarice
and
respected
by
those
whose
interest
it
was
not
to
abolish
it
the
buyers
and
the
sellers
were
equally
satisfied
thus
barely
anybody
protested
until
the
troubles
of
the
reformation
it
must
be
admitted
that
an
exact
note
of
all
these
imposts
would
be
of
great
service
to
the
history
of
the
human
mind
we
shall
try
to
extract
from
this
word
a
notion
which
may
be
useful
one
disputes
every
day
if
in
war
luck
or
leadership
produces
successes
if
in
disease
nature
acts
more
than
medicine
for
curing
or
killing
if
in
jurisprudence
it
is
not
very
advantageous
to
come
to
terms
when
one
is
in
the
right
and
to
plead
when
one
is
in
the
wrong
if
literature
contributes
to
the
glory
of
a
nation
or
to
its
decadence
if
one
should
or
should
not
make
the
people
superstitious
if
there
is
anything
true
in
metaphysics
history
and
moral
philosophy
if
taste
is
arbitrary
and
if
there
is
in
fact
good
taste
and
bad
taste
etc
to
decide
all
these
questions
right
away
take
an
example
of
what
is
the
most
extreme
in
each
compare
the
two
opposed
extremes
and
you
will
at
once
discover
which
is
true
you
wish
to
know
if
leadership
can
infallibly
determine
the
success
of
the
war
look
at
the
most
extreme
case
the
most
opposed
situations
in
which
leadership
alone
will
infallibly
triumph
the
enemy
army
is
forced
to
pass
through
a
deep
mountain
gorge
your
general
knows
it
he
makes
a
forced
march
he
takes
possession
of
the
heights
he
holds
the
enemy
shut
in
a
pass
they
must
either
die
or
surrender
in
this
extreme
case
luck
can
not
have
any
part
in
the
victory
it
is
therefore
demonstrated
that
skill
can
determine
the
success
of
a
campaign
from
that
alone
is
it
proved
that
war
is
an
art
now
imagine
an
advantageous
but
less
decisive
position
success
is
not
so
certain
but
it
is
always
very
probable
you
arrive
thus
step
by
step
to
a
perfect
equality
between
the
two
armies
what
will
decide
then
luck
that
is
to
say
an
unforeseen
event
a
general
officer
killed
when
he
is
on
his
way
to
execute
an
important
order
a
corps
which
is
shaken
by
a
false
rumour
a
panic
and
a
thousand
other
cases
which
can
not
be
remedied
by
prudence
but
it
still
remains
certain
that
there
is
an
art
a
generalship
as
much
must
be
said
of
medicine
of
this
art
of
operating
on
the
head
and
the
hand
to
restore
life
to
a
man
who
is
about
to
lose
it
the
first
man
who
at
the
right
moment
bled
and
purged
a
sufferer
from
an
apoplectic
fit
the
first
man
who
thought
of
plunging
a
knife
into
the
bladder
in
order
to
extract
a
stone
and
of
closing
the
wound
again
the
first
man
who
knew
how
to
stop
gangrene
in
a
part
of
the
body
were
without
a
doubt
almost
divine
persons
and
did
not
resemble
doctors
descend
from
this
obvious
example
to
experiments
that
are
less
striking
and
more
equivocal
you
see
fevers
ills
of
all
kinds
which
are
cured
without
it
being
well
proved
if
it
be
nature
or
the
doctor
who
has
cured
them
you
see
diseases
of
which
the
result
can
not
be
guessed
twenty
doctors
are
deceived
the
one
that
has
the
most
intelligence
the
surest
eye
guesses
the
character
of
the
malady
there
is
therefore
an
art
and
the
superior
man
knows
the
finenesses
of
it
thus
did
la
peyronie
guess
that
a
man
of
the
court
had
swallowed
a
pointed
bone
which
had
caused
an
ulcer
and
put
him
in
danger
of
death
thus
did
boerhaave
guess
the
cause
of
the
malady
as
unknown
as
cruel
of
a
count
of
vassenaar
there
is
therefore
really
an
art
of
medicine
but
in
all
arts
there
are
men
like
virgil
and
mævius
in
jurisprudence
take
a
clear
case
in
which
the
law
speaks
clearly
a
bill
of
exchange
properly
prepared
and
accepted
the
acceptor
must
be
condemned
to
pay
it
in
every
country
there
is
therefore
a
useful
jurisprudence
although
in
a
thousand
cases
judgments
are
arbitrary
to
the
misfortune
of
the
human
race
because
the
laws
are
badly
made
do
you
desire
to
know
if
literature
does
good
to
a
nation
compare
the
two
extremes
cicero
and
an
uncouth
ignoramus
see
if
it
is
pliny
or
attila
who
caused
the
fall
of
rome
one
asks
if
one
should
encourage
superstition
in
the
people
see
above
all
what
is
most
extreme
in
this
disastrous
matter
bartholomew
the
massacres
in
ireland
the
crusades
the
question
is
soon
answered
is
there
any
truth
in
metaphysics
seize
first
of
all
the
points
that
are
most
astonishing
and
the
most
true
something
exists
for
all
eternity
an
eternal
being
exists
by
himself
this
being
can
not
be
either
wicked
or
inconsequent
one
must
surrender
to
these
truths
almost
all
the
rest
is
given
over
to
dispute
and
the
justest
mind
unravels
the
truth
while
the
others
are
seeking
in
the
shadows
it
is
with
all
things
as
with
colours
the
weakest
eyes
distinguish
black
from
white
the
better
more
practised
eyes
discern
shades
that
resemble
each
other
what
is
this
ezourveidam
which
is
in
the
king
of
france
library
it
is
an
ancient
commentary
which
an
ancient
brahmin
composed
once
upon
a
time
before
the
epoch
of
alexander
on
the
ancient
veidam
which
was
itself
much
less
ancient
than
the
book
of
the
shasta
let
us
respect
i
tell
you
all
these
ancient
indians
they
invented
the
game
of
chess
and
the
greeks
went
among
them
to
learn
geometry
this
ezourveidam
was
lastly
translated
by
a
brahmin
correspondent
of
the
unfortunate
french
india
company
it
was
brought
to
me
on
mount
krapack
where
i
have
long
been
observing
the
snows
and
i
sent
it
to
the
great
library
of
paris
where
it
is
better
placed
than
in
my
home
those
who
wish
to
consult
it
will
see
that
after
many
revolutions
produced
by
the
eternal
it
pleased
the
eternal
to
form
a
man
who
was
called
and
a
woman
whose
name
corresponds
to
that
of
life
is
this
indian
anecdote
taken
from
the
jewish
books
have
the
jews
copied
it
from
the
indians
or
can
one
say
that
both
wrote
it
originally
and
that
fine
minds
meet
the
jews
were
not
permitted
to
think
that
their
writers
had
drawn
anything
from
the
brahmins
for
they
had
never
heard
tell
of
them
we
are
not
permitted
to
think
about
adam
otherwise
than
the
jews
consequently
i
hold
my
tongue
and
i
do
not
think
at
all
have
long
pondered
whether
or
no
we
should
print
this
article
which
we
found
in
an
old
book
our
respect
for
peter
see
restrained
us
but
some
pious
men
having
convinced
us
that
pope
alexander
vi
had
nothing
in
common
with
peter
we
at
last
decided
to
bring
this
little
piece
into
the
light
without
one
day
prince
pico
della
mirandola
met
pope
alexander
vi
at
the
house
of
the
courtesan
emilia
while
lucretia
the
holy
father
daughter
was
in
and
one
did
not
know
in
rome
if
the
child
was
the
pope
or
his
son
the
duke
of
valentinois
or
lucretia
husband
alphonse
of
aragon
who
passed
for
impotent
the
conversation
was
at
first
very
sprightly
cardinal
bembo
records
a
part
of
it
little
pic
said
the
pope
who
do
you
think
is
my
grandson
father
your
i
think
answered
pic
eh
how
can
you
believe
such
folly
i
believe
it
through
faith
but
do
you
not
know
quite
well
that
a
man
who
is
impotent
does
not
make
children
faith
consists
returned
pic
in
believing
things
because
they
are
impossible
and
further
the
honour
of
your
house
demands
that
lucretia
son
shall
not
pass
as
the
fruit
of
an
incest
you
make
me
believe
more
incomprehensible
mysteries
have
i
not
to
be
convinced
that
a
serpent
spoke
that
since
then
all
men
have
been
damned
that
also
spoke
very
eloquently
and
that
the
walls
of
jericho
fell
at
the
sound
of
trumpets
pic
forthwith
ran
through
a
litany
of
all
the
admirable
things
he
believed
alexander
fell
on
his
sofa
by
dint
of
laughing
i
believe
all
that
like
you
he
said
for
i
know
well
that
only
by
faith
can
i
be
saved
and
that
i
shall
not
be
saved
by
my
works
ah
holy
father
said
pic
you
have
need
of
neither
works
nor
faith
that
is
good
for
poor
profane
people
like
us
but
you
who
are
can
believe
and
do
all
you
want
to
you
have
the
keys
of
heaven
and
without
a
doubt
peter
will
not
close
the
door
in
your
face
but
for
myself
i
avow
i
should
need
potent
protection
if
being
only
a
poor
prince
i
had
slept
with
my
daughter
and
if
i
had
used
the
stiletto
and
the
cantarella
as
often
as
your
holiness
alexander
could
take
a
jest
let
us
talk
seriously
he
said
to
prince
della
mirandola
tell
me
what
merit
one
can
have
in
telling
god
that
one
is
persuaded
of
things
of
which
in
fact
one
can
not
be
persuaded
what
pleasure
can
that
give
god
between
ourselves
saying
that
one
believes
what
is
impossible
to
believe
is
lying
pico
della
mirandola
made
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
eh
paternal
god
he
cried
may
your
holiness
pardon
me
you
are
not
a
christian
no
by
my
faith
said
the
pope
i
thought
as
much
said
pico
della
mirandola
we
have
blind
men
men
men
men
with
long
sight
short
sight
clear
sight
dim
sight
weak
sight
all
that
is
a
faithful
enough
image
of
our
understanding
but
we
are
barely
acquainted
with
false
sight
there
are
hardly
men
who
always
take
a
cock
for
a
horse
or
a
for
a
house
why
do
we
often
come
across
minds
otherwise
just
enough
which
are
absolutely
false
on
important
things
why
does
this
same
siamese
who
will
never
let
himself
be
cheated
when
there
is
question
of
counting
him
three
rupees
firmly
believe
in
the
metamorphoses
of
sammonocodom
by
what
strange
singularity
do
sensible
men
resemble
don
quixote
who
thought
he
saw
giants
where
other
men
saw
only
windmills
still
don
quixote
was
more
excusable
than
the
siamese
who
believes
that
sammonocodom
came
several
times
on
earth
and
than
the
turk
who
is
persuaded
that
mahomet
put
half
the
moon
in
his
sleeve
for
don
quixote
struck
with
the
idea
that
he
must
fight
giants
can
figure
to
himself
that
a
giant
must
have
a
body
as
big
as
a
mill
but
from
what
supposition
can
a
sensible
man
set
off
to
persuade
himself
that
the
half
of
the
moon
has
gone
into
a
sleeve
and
that
a
sammonocodom
has
come
down
from
heaven
to
play
at
shuttlecock
cut
down
a
forest
and
perform
feats
of
legerdemain
the
greatest
geniuses
can
have
false
judgment
about
a
principle
they
have
accepted
without
examination
newton
had
very
false
judgment
when
he
commentated
the
apocalypse
all
that
certain
tyrants
of
the
souls
desire
is
that
the
men
they
teach
shall
have
false
judgment
a
fakir
rears
a
child
who
gives
much
promise
he
spends
five
or
six
years
in
driving
into
his
head
that
the
god
fo
appeared
to
men
as
a
white
elephant
and
he
persuades
the
child
that
he
will
be
whipped
after
his
death
for
five
hundred
thousand
years
if
he
does
not
believe
these
metamorphoses
he
adds
that
at
the
end
of
the
world
the
enemy
of
the
god
fo
will
come
to
fight
against
this
divinity
the
child
studies
and
becomes
a
prodigy
he
argues
on
his
lessons
he
finds
that
fo
has
only
been
able
to
change
himself
into
a
white
elephant
because
that
is
the
most
beautiful
of
animals
the
kings
of
siam
and
pegu
he
says
have
made
war
for
a
white
elephant
certainly
if
fo
had
not
been
hidden
in
that
elephant
these
kings
would
not
have
been
so
senseless
as
to
fight
simply
for
the
possession
of
an
animal
the
enemy
of
fo
will
come
to
defy
him
at
the
end
of
the
world
certainly
this
enemy
will
be
a
rhinoceros
for
the
rhinoceros
fights
the
elephant
it
is
thus
that
in
mature
age
the
fakir
learned
pupil
reasons
and
he
becomes
one
of
the
lights
of
india
the
more
subtle
his
mind
the
more
false
is
it
and
he
forms
later
minds
as
false
as
his
one
shows
all
these
fanatics
a
little
geometry
and
they
learn
it
easily
enough
but
strange
to
relate
their
minds
are
not
straightened
for
that
they
perceive
the
truths
of
geometry
but
they
do
not
learn
to
weigh
probabilities
they
have
got
into
a
habit
they
will
reason
crookedly
all
their
lives
and
i
am
sorry
for
them
there
are
unfortunately
many
ways
of
having
a
false
mind
by
not
examining
if
the
principle
is
true
even
when
one
deduces
accurate
consequences
therefrom
and
this
way
is
common
by
drawing
false
consequences
from
a
principle
recognized
as
true
for
example
a
servant
is
asked
if
his
master
is
in
his
room
by
persons
he
suspects
of
wanting
his
life
if
he
were
foolish
enough
to
tell
them
the
truth
on
the
pretext
that
one
must
not
lie
it
is
clear
he
would
be
drawing
an
absurd
consequence
from
a
very
true
principle
a
judge
who
would
condemn
a
man
who
has
killed
his
assassin
because
homicide
is
forbidden
would
be
as
iniquitous
as
he
was
poor
reasoner
similar
cases
are
subdivided
in
a
thousand
different
gradations
the
good
mind
the
just
mind
is
that
which
distinguishes
them
whence
comes
that
one
has
seen
so
many
iniquitous
judgments
not
because
the
hearts
were
bad
but
because
they
were
not
sufficiently
enlightened
a
young
journeyman
pastrycook
who
had
been
to
college
and
who
still
knew
a
few
of
cicero
phrases
boasted
one
day
of
loving
his
fatherland
what
do
you
mean
by
your
fatherland
a
neighbour
asked
him
is
it
your
oven
is
it
the
village
where
you
were
born
and
which
you
have
never
seen
since
is
it
the
street
where
dwelled
your
father
and
mother
who
have
been
ruined
and
have
reduced
you
to
baking
little
pies
for
a
living
is
it
the
where
you
will
never
be
police
superintendent
clerk
is
it
the
church
of
our
lady
where
you
have
not
been
able
to
become
a
while
an
absurd
man
is
archbishop
and
duke
with
an
income
of
twenty
thousand
golden
louis
the
journeyman
pastrycook
did
not
know
what
to
answer
a
thinker
who
was
listening
to
this
conversation
concluded
that
in
a
fatherland
of
some
extent
there
were
often
many
thousand
men
who
had
no
fatherland
you
pleasure
loving
parisian
who
have
never
made
any
great
journey
save
that
to
dieppe
to
eat
fresh
fish
who
know
nothing
but
your
varnished
town
house
your
pretty
country
house
and
your
box
at
that
opera
where
the
rest
of
europe
persists
in
feeling
bored
who
speak
your
own
language
agreeably
enough
because
you
know
no
other
you
love
all
that
and
you
love
further
the
girls
you
keep
the
champagne
which
comes
to
you
from
rheims
the
dividends
which
the
pays
you
every
six
months
and
you
say
you
love
your
fatherland
in
all
conscience
does
a
financier
cordially
love
his
fatherland
the
officer
and
the
soldier
who
will
pillage
their
winter
quarters
if
one
lets
them
have
they
a
very
warm
love
for
the
peasants
they
ruin
where
was
the
fatherland
of
the
scarred
duc
de
guise
was
it
in
nancy
paris
madrid
rome
what
fatherland
have
you
cardinals
de
la
balue
duprat
lorraine
mazarin
where
was
the
fatherland
of
attila
and
of
a
hundred
heroes
of
this
type
i
would
like
someone
to
tell
me
which
was
abraham
fatherland
the
first
man
to
write
that
the
fatherland
is
wherever
one
feels
comfortable
was
i
believe
euripides
in
his
phaeton
but
the
first
man
who
left
his
birthplace
to
seek
his
comfort
elsewhere
had
said
it
before
him
where
then
is
the
fatherland
is
it
not
a
good
field
whose
owner
lodged
in
a
house
can
say
this
field
that
i
till
this
house
that
i
have
built
are
mine
i
live
there
protected
by
laws
which
no
tyrant
can
infringe
when
those
who
like
me
possess
fields
and
houses
meet
in
their
common
interest
i
have
my
voice
in
the
assembly
i
am
a
part
of
everything
a
part
of
the
community
a
part
of
the
dominion
there
is
my
well
now
is
it
better
for
your
fatherland
to
be
a
monarchy
or
a
republic
for
four
thousand
years
has
this
question
been
debated
ask
the
rich
for
an
answer
they
all
prefer
aristocracy
question
the
people
they
want
democracy
only
kings
prefer
royalty
how
then
is
it
that
nearly
the
whole
world
is
governed
by
monarchs
ask
the
rats
who
proposed
to
hang
a
bell
round
the
cat
neck
but
in
truth
the
real
reason
is
as
has
been
said
that
men
are
very
rarely
worthy
of
governing
themselves
it
is
sad
that
often
in
order
to
be
a
good
patriot
one
is
the
enemy
of
the
rest
of
mankind
to
be
a
good
patriot
is
to
wish
that
one
city
may
be
enriched
by
trade
and
be
powerful
by
arms
it
is
clear
that
one
country
can
not
gain
without
another
loses
and
that
it
can
not
conquer
without
making
misery
such
then
is
the
human
state
that
to
wish
for
one
country
greatness
is
to
wish
harm
to
one
neighbours
he
who
should
wish
that
his
fatherland
might
never
be
greater
smaller
richer
poorer
would
be
the
citizen
of
the
world
if
a
clock
is
not
made
to
tell
the
hour
i
will
then
admit
that
final
causes
are
chimeras
and
i
shall
consider
it
quite
right
for
people
to
call
me
that
is
an
imbecile
all
the
pieces
of
the
machine
of
this
world
seem
however
made
for
each
other
a
few
philosophers
affect
to
mock
at
the
final
causes
rejected
by
epicurus
and
lucretius
it
is
it
seems
to
me
at
epicurus
and
lucretius
rather
that
they
should
mock
they
tell
you
that
the
eye
is
not
made
for
seeing
but
that
man
has
availed
himself
of
it
for
this
purpose
when
he
perceived
that
eyes
could
be
so
used
according
to
them
the
mouth
is
not
made
for
speaking
for
eating
the
stomach
for
digesting
the
heart
for
receiving
the
blood
from
the
veins
and
for
dispatching
it
through
the
arteries
the
feet
for
walking
the
ears
for
hearing
these
persons
avow
nevertheless
that
tailors
make
them
coats
to
clothe
them
and
masons
houses
to
lodge
them
and
they
dare
deny
to
nature
to
the
great
being
to
the
universal
intelligence
what
they
accord
to
the
least
of
their
workmen
of
course
one
must
not
make
an
abuse
of
final
causes
we
have
remarked
that
in
vain
prieur
in
the
spectacle
of
nature
maintains
that
the
tides
are
given
to
the
ocean
so
that
vessels
may
enter
port
more
easily
and
to
stop
the
water
of
the
sea
from
putrefying
in
vain
would
he
say
that
legs
are
made
to
be
booted
and
the
nose
to
wear
spectacles
in
order
that
one
may
be
certain
of
the
true
end
for
which
a
cause
functions
it
is
essential
that
that
effect
shall
exist
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
there
were
not
ships
at
all
times
and
on
all
the
seas
hence
one
can
not
say
that
the
ocean
was
made
for
the
ships
one
feels
how
ridiculous
it
would
be
to
maintain
that
nature
had
worked
from
all
time
in
order
to
adjust
herself
to
the
inventions
of
our
arbitrary
arts
which
appeared
so
late
but
it
is
quite
evident
that
if
noses
were
not
made
for
spectacles
they
were
for
smelling
and
that
there
have
been
noses
ever
since
there
have
been
men
similarly
hands
not
having
been
given
on
behalf
of
they
are
visibly
destined
for
all
the
purposes
which
the
metacarpal
bones
and
the
phalanges
and
the
circular
muscle
of
the
wrist
may
procure
for
us
cicero
who
doubted
everything
did
not
however
doubt
final
causes
it
seems
especially
difficult
for
the
organs
of
generation
not
to
be
destined
to
perpetuate
the
species
this
mechanism
is
very
admirable
but
the
sensation
which
nature
has
joined
to
this
mechanism
is
still
more
admirable
epicurus
had
to
avow
that
pleasure
is
divine
and
that
this
pleasure
is
a
final
cause
by
which
are
ceaselessly
produced
sentient
beings
who
have
not
been
able
to
give
themselves
sensation
this
epicurus
was
a
great
man
for
his
time
he
saw
what
descartes
denied
what
gassendi
affirmed
what
newton
demonstrated
that
there
is
no
movement
without
space
he
conceived
the
necessity
of
atoms
to
serve
as
constituent
parts
of
invariable
species
those
are
exceedingly
philosophical
ideas
nothing
was
especially
more
worthy
of
respect
than
the
moral
system
of
the
true
epicureans
it
consisted
in
the
removal
to
a
distance
of
public
matters
incompatible
with
wisdom
and
in
friendship
without
which
life
is
a
burden
but
as
regards
the
rest
of
epicurus
physics
they
do
not
appear
any
more
admissible
than
descartes
channelled
matter
it
is
it
seems
to
me
to
stop
one
eyes
and
understanding
to
maintain
that
there
is
no
design
in
nature
and
if
there
is
design
there
is
an
intelligent
cause
there
exists
a
god
people
present
to
us
as
objections
the
irregularities
of
the
globe
the
volcanoes
the
plains
of
shifting
sands
a
few
small
mountains
destroyed
and
others
formed
by
earthquakes
etc
but
from
the
fact
that
the
naves
of
the
wheels
of
your
coach
have
caught
fire
does
it
ensue
that
your
coach
was
not
made
expressly
to
carry
you
from
one
place
to
another
the
chains
of
mountains
which
crown
the
two
hemispheres
and
more
than
six
hundred
rivers
which
flow
right
to
the
sea
from
the
feet
of
these
rocks
all
the
streams
which
come
down
from
these
same
reservoirs
and
which
swell
the
rivers
after
fertilizing
the
country
the
thousands
of
fountains
which
start
from
the
same
source
and
which
water
animal
and
vegetable
kind
all
these
things
seem
no
more
the
effect
of
a
fortuitous
cause
and
of
a
declension
of
atoms
than
the
retina
which
receives
the
rays
of
light
the
crystalline
lens
which
refracts
them
the
incus
the
malleus
the
stapes
the
tympanic
membrane

which
receives

sounds
the
paths
of

in
our
veins
the
systole
and
diastole
of
the
heart
this
pendulum
of
the
machine
which
makes
life
bambabef
the
fakir
one
day
met
one
of
the
disciples
of
confutzee
whom
we
call
confucius
and
this
disciple
was
named
ouang
and
bambabef
maintained
that
the
people
had
need
of
being
deceived
and
ouang
claimed
that
one
should
never
deceive
anybody
and
here
is
the
summary
of
their
dispute
bambabef
we
must
imitate
the
supreme
being
who
does
not
show
us
things
as
they
are
he
makes
us
see
the
sun
in
a
diameter
of
two
or
three
feet
although
this
star
is
a
million
times
bigger
than
the
earth
he
makes
us
see
the
moon
and
the
stars
set
on
the
same
blue
background
whereas
they
are
at
different
depths
he
requires
that
a
square
tower
shall
appear
round
to
us
from
a
distance
he
requires
that
fire
shall
seem
hot
to
us
although
it
is
neither
hot
nor
cold
in
fine
he
surrounds
us
with
errors
suited
to
our
nature
ouang
what
you
name
error
is
not
one
at
all
the
sun
placed
as
it
is
at
millions
of
millions
of
lis
beyond
our
globe
is
not
the
sun
we
see
we
perceive
in
reality
and
we
can
perceive
only
the
sun
which
is
depicted
in
our
retina
at
a
determined
angle
our
eyes
have
not
been
given
us
for
appreciating
sizes
and
distances
we
need
other
aids
and
other
operations
to
appreciate
them
bambabef
seemed
very
astonished
at
this
proposition
ouang
who
was
very
patient
explained
to
him
the
theory
of
optics
and
bambabef
who
had
a
quick
understanding
surrendered
to
the
demonstrations
of
disciple
then
he
resumed
the
argument
bambabef
if
god
does
not
deceive
us
through
the
medium
of
our
senses
as
i
believed
avow
at
least
that
doctors
always
deceive
children
for
their
good
they
tell
them
that
they
are
giving
them
sugar
and
in
fact
they
are
giving
them
rhubarb
i
a
fakir
may
then
deceive
the
people
who
are
as
ignorant
as
the
children
ouang
i
have
two
sons
i
have
never
deceived
them
when
they
have
been
ill
i
have
told
them
that
there
was
a
very
bitter
medicine
and
that
they
must
have
the
courage
to
take
it
it
would
harm
you
if
it
were
sweet
i
have
never
allowed
their
masters
and
teachers
to
make
them
afraid
of
spirits
ghosts
goblins
sorcerers
by
this
means
i
have
made
brave
wise
young
citizens
of
them
bambabef
the
people
are
not
born
so
happily
as
your
family
ouang
all
men
are
alike
or
nearly
so
they
are
born
with
the
same
dispositions
one
must
not
corrupt
men
natures
bambabef
we
teach
them
errors
i
admit
but
it
is
for
their
good
we
make
them
believe
that
if
they
do
not
buy
the
nails
we
have
blessed
if
they
do
not
expiate
their
sins
by
giving
us
money
they
will
become
in
another
life
dogs
or
lizards
that
intimidates
them
and
they
become
honest
people
ouang
do
you
not
see
that
you
are
perverting
these
poor
people
there
are
among
them
many
more
than
you
think
who
reason
who
laugh
at
your
miracles
at
your
superstitions
who
see
quite
well
that
they
will
not
be
changed
into
either
lizards
or
what
is
the
consequence
they
have
enough
sense
to
see
that
you
are
telling
them
impertinences
and
they
have
not
enough
to
raise
themselves
toward
a
religion
that
is
pure
and
free
from
superstition
such
as
ours
their
passions
make
them
believe
that
there
is
no
religion
at
all
because
the
only
one
that
is
taught
them
is
ridiculous
you
become
guilty
of
all
the
vices
in
which
they
are
plunged
bambabef
not
at
all
for
we
do
not
teach
them
anything
but
good
morality
ouang
you
would
have
yourselves
stoned
by
the
people
if
you
taught
them
impure
morality
men
are
so
made
that
they
want
to
do
evil
but
that
they
do
not
want
it
preached
to
them
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
you
should
not
mix
a
wise
moral
system
with
absurd
fables
because
you
weaken
through
your
impostures
which
you
can
do
without
the
morality
that
you
are
forced
to
teach
bambabef
what
you
believe
that
one
can
teach
the
people
truth
without
strengthening
it
with
fables
ouang
i
firmly
believe
it
our
literati
are
of
the
same
stuff
as
our
tailors
our
weavers
and
our
husbandmen
they
worship
a
god
creator
rewarder
avenger
they
do
not
sully
their
worship
either
by
absurd
systems
or
by
extravagant
ceremonies
and
there
are
far
less
crimes
among
the
literati
than
among
the
people
why
not
deign
to
instruct
our
workmen
as
we
instruct
our
literati
bambabef
you
would
be
very
foolish
it
is
as
if
you
wanted
them
to
have
the
same
courtesy
to
be
lawyers
that
is
neither
possible
nor
proper
there
must
be
white
bread
for
the
masters
and
brown
bread
for
the
servants
ouang
i
admit
that
all
men
should
not
have
the
same
learning
but
there
are
some
things
necessary
to
all
it
is
necessary
that
all
men
should
be
just
and
the
surest
way
of
inspiring
all
men
with
justice
is
to
inspire
in
them
religion
without
superstition
bambabef
it
is
a
fine
project
but
it
is
impracticable
do
you
think
that
men
will
be
satisfied
to
believe
in
a
god
who
punishes
and
rewards
you
have
told
me
that
it
often
happens
that
the
most
shrewd
among
the
people
revolt
against
my
fables
they
will
revolt
in
the
same
way
against
truth
they
will
say
who
will
assure
me
that
god
punishes
and
rewards
where
is
the
proof
of
it
what
is
your
mission
what
miracle
have
you
performed
that
i
may
believe
you
they
will
laugh
at
you
much
more
than
at
me
ouang
that
is
where
you
are
mistaken
you
imagine
that
people
will
shake
off
the
yoke
of
an
honest
probable
idea
that
is
useful
to
everyone
of
an
idea
in
accordance
with
human
reason
because
people
reject
things
that
are
dishonest
absurd
useless
dangerous
that
make
good
sense
shudder
the
people
are
very
disposed
to
believe
their
magistrates
when
their
magistrates
propose
to
them
only
a
reasonable
belief
they
embrace
it
willingly
there
is
no
need
of
prodigies
for
believing
in
a
just
god
who
reads
in
man
heart
this
idea
is
too
natural
too
necessary
to
be
combated
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
precisely
how
god
will
punish
and
reward
it
suffices
that
people
believe
in
his
justice
i
assure
you
i
have
seen
entire
towns
which
have
had
barely
any
other
dogma
and
that
it
is
in
those
towns
that
i
have
seen
most
virtue
bambabef
take
care
in
those
towns
you
will
find
philosophers
who
will
deny
you
both
your
pains
and
your
recompenses
ouang
you
will
admit
to
me
that
these
philosophers
will
deny
your
inventions
still
more
strongly
so
you
gain
nothing
from
that
though
there
are
philosophers
who
do
not
agree
with
my
principles
there
are
honest
people
none
the
less
none
the
less
do
they
cultivate
the
virtue
of
them
which
must
be
embraced
by
love
and
not
by
fear
but
further
i
maintain
that
no
philosopher
would
ever
be
assured
that
providence
did
not
reserve
pains
for
the
wicked
and
rewards
for
the
good
for
if
they
ask
me
who
told
me
that
god
punishes
i
shall
ask
them
who
has
told
them
that
god
does
not
punish
in
fine
i
maintain
that
these
philosophers
far
from
contradicting
me
will
help
me
would
you
like
to
be
a
philosopher
bambabef
willingly
but
do
not
tell
the
fakirs
ouang
let
us
think
above
all
that
if
a
philosopher
wishes
to
be
useful
to
human
society
he
must
announce
a
god
footnotes
a
li
is
paces
ever
since
men
have
reasoned
the
philosophers
have
obscured
this
matter
but
the
theologians
have
rendered
it
unintelligible
by
absurd
subtleties
about
grace
locke
is
perhaps
the
first
man
to
find
a
thread
in
this
labyrinth
for
he
is
the
first
who
without
having
the
arrogance
of
trusting
in
setting
out
from
a
general
principle
examined
human
nature
by
analysis
for
three
thousand
years
people
have
disputed
whether
or
no
the
will
is
free
in
the
essay
on
the
human
understanding
chapter
on
power
locke
shows
first
of
all
that
the
question
is
absurd
and
that
liberty
can
no
more
belong
to
the
will
than
can
colour
and
movement
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
to
be
free
it
means
to
be
able
or
assuredly
it
has
no
sense
for
the
will
to
be
able
is
as
ridiculous
at
bottom
as
to
say
that
the
will
is
yellow
or
blue
round
or
square
to
will
is
to
wish
and
to
be
free
is
to
be
able
let
us
note
step
by
step
the
chain
of
what
passes
in
us
without
obfuscating
our
minds
by
any
terms
of
the
schools
or
any
antecedent
principle
it
is
proposed
to
you
that
you
mount
a
horse
you
must
absolutely
make
a
choice
for
it
is
quite
clear
that
you
either
will
go
or
that
you
will
not
go
there
is
no
middle
way
it
is
therefore
of
absolute
necessity
that
you
wish
yes
or
no
up
to
there
it
is
demonstrated
that
the
will
is
not
free
you
wish
to
mount
the
horse
why
the
reason
an
ignoramus
will
say
is
because
i
wish
it
this
answer
is
idiotic
nothing
happens
or
can
happen
without
a
reason
a
cause
there
is
one
therefore
for
your
wish
what
is
it
the
agreeable
idea
of
going
on
horseback
which
presents
itself
in
your
brain
the
dominant
idea
the
determinant
idea
but
you
will
say
can
i
not
resist
an
idea
which
dominates
me
no
for
what
would
be
the
cause
of
your
resistance
none
by
your
will
you
can
obey
only
an
idea
which
will
dominate
you
more
now
you
receive
all
your
ideas
therefore
you
receive
your
wish
you
wish
therefore
necessarily
the
word
liberty
does
not
therefore
belong
in
any
way
to
your
will
you
ask
me
how
thought
and
wish
are
formed
in
us
i
answer
you
that
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
i
do
not
know
how
ideas
are
made
any
more
than
how
the
world
was
made
all
that
is
given
to
us
is
to
grope
for
what
passes
in
our
incomprehensible
machine
the
will
therefore
is
not
a
faculty
that
one
can
call
free
a
free
will
is
an
expression
absolutely
void
of
sense
and
what
the
scholastics
have
called
will
of
indifference
that
is
to
say
willing
without
cause
is
a
chimera
unworthy
of
being
combated
where
will
be
liberty
then
in
the
power
to
do
what
one
wills
i
wish
to
leave
my
study
the
door
is
open
i
am
free
to
leave
it
but
say
you
if
the
door
is
closed
and
i
wish
to
stay
at
home
i
stay
there
freely
let
us
be
explicit
you
exercise
then
the
power
that
you
have
of
staying
you
have
this
power
but
you
have
not
that
of
going
out
the
liberty
about
which
so
many
volumes
have
been
written
is
therefore
reduced
to
its
accurate
terms
only
the
power
of
acting
in
what
sense
then
must
one
utter
the
phrase
man
is
free
in
the
same
sense
that
one
utters
the
words
health
strength
happiness
man
is
not
always
strong
always
healthy
always
happy
a
great
passion
a
great
obstacle
deprive
him
of
his
liberty
his
power
of
action
the
word
liberty
is
therefore
an
abstract
word
a
general
word
like
beauty
goodness
justice
these
terms
do
not
state
that
all
men
are
always
beautiful
good
and
just
similarly
they
are
not
always
free
let
us
go
further
this
liberty
being
only
the
power
of
acting
what
is
this
power
it
is
the
effect
of
the
constitution
and
present
state
of
our
organs
leibnitz
wishes
to
resolve
a
geometrical
problem
he
has
an
apoplectic
fit
he
certainly
has
not
liberty
to
resolve
his
problem
is
a
vigorous
young
man
madly
in
love
who
holds
his
willing
mistress
in
his
arms
free
to
tame
his
passion
undoubtedly
not
he
has
the
power
of
enjoying
and
has
not
the
power
of
refraining
locke
was
therefore
very
right
to
call
liberty
power
when
is
it
that
this
young
man
can
refrain
despite
the
violence
of
his
passion
when
a
stronger
idea
determines
in
a
contrary
sense
the
activity
of
his
body
and
his
soul
but
what
the
other
animals
will
have
the
same
liberty
then
the
same
power
why
not
they
have
senses
memory
feeling
perceptions
as
we
have
they
act
with
spontaneity
as
we
act
they
must
have
also
as
we
have
the
power
of
acting
by
virtue
of
their
perceptions
by
virtue
of
the
play
of
their
organs
someone
cries
if
it
be
so
everything
is
only
machine
everything
in
the
universe
is
subjected
to
eternal
laws
well
would
you
have
everything
at
the
pleasure
of
a
million
blind
caprices
either
everything
is
the
sequence
of
the
necessity
of
the
nature
of
things
or
everything
is
the
effect
of
the
eternal
order
of
an
absolute
master
in
both
cases
we
are
only
wheels
in
the
machine
of
the
world
it
is
a
vain
witticism
a
commonplace
to
say
that
without
the
pretended
liberty
of
the
will
all
pains
and
rewards
are
useless
reason
and
you
will
come
to
a
quite
contrary
conclusion
if
a
brigand
is
executed
his
accomplice
who
sees
him
expire
has
the
liberty
of
not
being
frightened
at
the
punishment
if
his
will
is
determined
by
itself
he
will
go
from
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
to
assassinate
on
the
broad
highway
if
his
organs
stricken
with
horror
make
him
experience
an
unconquerable
terror
he
will
stop
robbing
his
companion
punishment
becomes
useful
to
him
and
an
insurance
for
society
only
so
long
as
his
will
is
not
free
liberty
then
is
only
and
can
be
only
the
power
to
do
what
one
will
that
is
what
philosophy
teaches
us
but
if
one
considers
liberty
in
the
theological
sense
it
is
a
matter
so
sublime
that
profane
eyes
dare
not
raise
themselves
to
it
footnotes
see
liberty
the
french
language
did
not
begin
to
have
any
form
until
towards
the
tenth
century
it
was
born
from
the
ruins
of
latin
and
celtic
mixed
with
a
few
germanic
words
this
language
was
first
of
all
the
rustic
roman
and
the
germanic
language
was
the
court
language
up
to
the
time
of
charles
the
bald
germanic
remained
the
sole
language
of
germany
after
the
great
epoch
of
the
partition
of
rustic
roman
the
romance
language
prevailed
in
western
france
the
people
of
the
country
of
vaud
of
the
valais
of
the
engadine
valley
and
of
a
few
other
cantons
still
retain
manifest
vestiges
of
this
idiom
at

end
of
the
tenth
century
french
was
formed
people
wrote
in
french
at
the
beginning
of
the
eleventh

this
french
still
retained
more
of
rustic
roman
than
the
french
of
the
romance
of
philomena
written
in
the
tenth
century
in
rustic
roman
is
not
in
a
tongue
very
different

the

have
nothing

are
in
old
gaulish
or
celtic
such
as
and
many
others
of
this
kind
most
of
the
terms
of
war
were
frank
or
german
all
the
rest
is
latin
and
all
the
latin
words
were
abridged
according
to
the
custom
and
genius
of
the
nations
of
the
north
thus
from
palais
from
loup
from
août
from
juin
from
oint
from
pourpre
from
prix
etc
hardly
were
there
left
any
vestiges
of
the
greek
tongue
which
had
been
so
long
spoken
at
marseilles
in
the
twelfth
century
there
began
to
be
introduced
into
the
language
some
of
the
terms
of
aristotle
philosophy
and
towards
the
sixteenth
century
one
expressed
by
greek
terms
all
the
parts
of
the
human
body
their
diseases
their
remedies
whence
the
words
and
so
many
others
although
the
language
then
enriched
itself
from
the
greek
and
although
since
charles
viii
it
had
drawn
much
aid
from
italian
already
perfected
the
french
language
had
not
yet
taken
regular
consistence
françois
ier
abolished
the
ancient
custom
of
pleading
judging
contracting
in
latin
custom
which
bore
witness
to
the
barbarism
of
a
language
which
one
did
not
dare
use
in
public
documents
a
pernicious
custom
for
citizens
whose
lot
was
regulated
in
a
language
they
did
not
understand
one
was
obliged
then
to
cultivate
french
but
the
language
was
neither
noble
nor
regular
the
syntax
was
left
to
caprice
the
genius
for
conversation
being
turned
to
pleasantries
the
language
became
very
fertile
in
burlesque
and
naïve
expressions
and
very
sterile
in
noble
and
harmonious
terms
from
this
it
comes
that
in
rhyming
dictionaries
one
finds
twenty
terms
suitable
for
comic
poetry
for
one
for
more
exalted
use
and
it
is
further
a
reason
why
marot
never
succeeded
in
a
serious
style
and
why
amyot
could
render
plutarch
elegance
only
with
naïveté
french
acquired
vigour
beneath
the
pen
of
montaigne
but
it
still
had
neither
nobility
nor
harmony
ronsard
spoiled
the
language
by
bringing
into
french
poetry
the
greek
compounds
which
the
doctors
and
philosophers
used
malherbe
repaired
ronsard
mischief
somewhat
the
language
became
more
noble
and
more
harmonious
with
the
establishment
of
the
académie
française
and
acquired
finally
in
the
reign
of
louis
the
perfection
whereby
it
might
be
carried
into
all
forms
of
composition
the
genius
of
this
language
is
order
and
clarity
for
each
language
has
its
genius
and
this
genius
consists
in
the
facility
which
the
language
gives
for
expressing
oneself
more
or
less
happily
for
using
or
rejecting
the
familiar
twists
of
other
languages
french
having
no
declensions
and
being
always
subject
to
the
article
can
not
adopt
greek
and
latin
inversions
it
obliges
words
to
arrange
themselves
in
the
natural
order
of
ideas
only
in
one
way
can
one
say
a
pris
soin
des
affaires
de
that
is
the
only
arrangement
one
can
give
to
these
words
express
this
phrase
in
latin
cæsaris
plancus
diligenter
one
can
arrange
these
words
in
a
hundred
and
twenty
ways
without
injuring
the
sense
and
without
troubling
the
language
the
auxiliary
verbs
which
eke
out
and
enervate
the
phrases
in
modern
languages
still
render
the
french
tongue
little
suited
to
the
concise
lapidary
style
the
auxiliary
verbs
its
pronouns
its
articles
its
lack
of
declinable
participles
and
finally
its
uniform
gait
are
injurious
to
the
great
enthusiasm
of
poetry
in
which
it
has
less
resources
than
italian
and
english
but
this
constraint
and
this
bondage
render
it
more
suitable
for
tragedy
and
comedy
than
any
language
in
europe
the
natural
order
in
which
one
is
obliged
to
express
thoughts
and
construct
one
phrases
diffuses
in
this
language
a
sweetness
and
easiness
that
is
pleasing
to
all
peoples
and
the
genius
of
the
nation
mingling
with
the
genius
of
the
language
has
produced
more
agreeably
written
books
than
can
be
seen
among
any
other
people
the
pleasure
and
liberty
of
society
having
been
long
known
only
in
france
the
language
has
received
therefrom
a
delicacy
of
expression
and
a
finesse
full
of
simplicity
barely
to
be
found
elsewhere
this
finesse
has
sometimes
been
exaggerated
but
people
of
taste
have
always
known
how
to
reduce
it
within
just
limits
many
persons
have
thought
that
the
french
language
has
become
impoverished
since
the
time
of
amyot
and
montaigne
one
does
indeed
find
in
many
authors
expressions
which
are
no
longer
admissible
but
they
are
for
the
most
part
familiar
expressions
for
which
equivalents
have
been
substituted
the
language
has
been
enriched
with
a
quantity
of
noble
and
energetic
expressions
and
without
speaking
here
of
the
eloquence
of
things
it
has
acquired
the
eloquence
of
words
it
is
in
the
reign
of
louis
as
has
been
said
that
this
eloquence
had
its
greatest
splendour
and
that
the
language
was
fixed
whatever
changes
time
and
caprice
prepare
for
it
the
good
authors
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
will
always
serve
as
models
friendship
is
the
marriage
of
the
soul
and
this
marriage
is
subject
to
divorce
it
is
a
tacit
contract
between
two
sensitive
and
virtuous
persons
i
say
sensitive
because
a
monk
a
recluse
can
be
not
wicked
and
live
without
knowing
what
friendship
is
i
say
virtuous
because
the
wicked
have
only
accomplices
voluptuaries
have
companions
in
debauch
have
partners
politicians
get
partisans
the
generality
of
idle
men
have
attachments
princes
have
courtiers
virtuous
men
alone
have
friends
cethegus
was
the
accomplice
of
catilina
and
maecenas
the
courtier
of
octavius
but
cicero
was
the
friend
of
atticus
during
the
reign
of
arcadius
logomacos
lecturer
in
theology
of
constantinople
went
to
scythia
and
halted
at
the
foot
of
the
caucasus
in
the
fertile
plains
of
zephirim
on
the
frontier
of
colchis
that
good
old
man
dondindac
was
in
his
great
lower
hall
between
his
sheepfold
and
his
vast
barn
he
was
kneeling
with
his
wife
his
five
sons
and
five
daughters
his
kindred
and
his
servants
and
after
a
light
meal
they
were
all
singing
god
praises
what
do
you
there
idolator
said
logomacos
to
him
i
am
not
an
idolator
answered
dondindac
you
must
be
an
idolator
said
logomacos
seeing
that
you
are
not
greek
tell
me
what
was
that
you
were
singing
in
your
barbarous
scythian
jargon
all
tongues
are
equal
in
the
ears
of
god
answered
the
scythian
we
were
singing
his
praises
that
very
extraordinary
returned
the
theologian
a
scythian
family
who
pray
god
without
having
been
taught
by
us
he
soon
engaged
dondindac
the
scythian
in
conversation
for
he
knew
a
little
scythian
and
the
other
a
little
greek
the
following
conversation
was
found
in
a
manuscript
preserved
in
the
library
of
constantinople
logomacos
let
us
see
if
you
know
your
catechism
why
do
you
pray
god
dondindac
because
it
is
right
to
worship
the
supreme
being
from
whom
we
hold
everything
logomacos
not
bad
for
a
barbarian
and
what
do
you
ask
of
him
dondindac
i
thank
him
for
the
benefits
i
enjoy
and
even
for
the
ills
with
which
he
tries
me
but
i
take
good
care
not
to
ask
him
for
anything
he
knows
better
than
us
what
we
need
and
besides
i
am
afraid
to
ask
him
for
good
weather
when
my
neighbour
is
asking
for
rain
logomacos
ah
i
thought
he
was
going
to
say
something
silly
let
us
start
again
farther
back
barbarian
who
has
told
you
there
is
a
god
dondindac
the
whole
of
nature
logomacos
that
does
not
suffice
what
idea
have
you
of
god
dondindac
the
idea
of
my
creator
of
my
master
who
will
reward
me
if
i
do
good
and
who
will
punish
me
if
i
do
logomacos
trash
nonsense
all
that
let
us
come
to
essentials
is
god
infinite
or
in
essence
dondindac
i
do
understand
you
logomacos
brutish
fool
is
god
in
one
place
beyond
all
places
or
in
all
places
dondindac
i
have
no
idea
just
as
you
please
logomacos
dolt
is
it
possible
for
what
has
been
not
to
have
been
and
can
a
stick
not
have
two
ends
does
he
see
the
future
as
future
or
as
present
how
does
he
draw
the
being
out
of
and
how
annihilate
the
being
dondindac
i
have
never
examined
these
things
logomacos
what
a
blockhead
come
one
must
humble
oneself
see
things
in
proportion
tell
me
my
friend
do
you
think
that
matter
can
be
eternal
dondindac
what
does
it
matter
to
me
whether
it
exists
from
all
eternity
or
not
i
do
not
exist
from
all
eternity
god
is
always
my
master
he
has
given
me
the
notion
of
justice
i
must
follow
it
i
do
not
want
to
be
a
philosopher
i
want
to
be
a
man
logomacos
these
blockheads
are
troublesome
let
us
go
step
by
step
what
is
god
dondindac
my
sovereign
my
judge
my
father
logomacos
that
not
what
i
asking
you
what
is
his
nature
dondindac
to
be
potent
and
good
logomacos
but
is
he
corporeal
or
spiritual
dondindac
how
should
i
know
logomacos
what
you
do
know
what
a
spirit
is
dondindac
not
in
the
least
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
me
should
i
be
more
just
should
i
be
a
better
husband
a
better
father
a
better
master
a
better
citizen
logomacos
it
is
absolutely
essential
you
should
learn
what
a
spirit
is
it
is
it
is
it
is
i
will
tell
you
another
time
dondindac
i
very
much
afraid
that
you
may
tell
me
less
what
it
is
than
what
it
is
not
allow
me
to
put
a
question
to
you
in
my
turn
i
once
saw
one
of
your
temples
why
do
you
depict
god
with
a
long
beard
logomacos
that
a
very
difficult
question
which
needs
preliminary
instruction
dondindac
before
receiving
your
instruction
i
must
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
one
day
i
had
just
built
a
closet
at
the
end
of
my
garden
i
heard
a
mole
arguing
with
a
cockchafer
that
a
very
fine
building
said
the
mole
it
must
have
been
a
very
powerful
mole
who
did
that
piece
of
work
you
joking
said
the
cockchafer
it
was
a
cockchafer
bubbling
over
with
genius
who
is
the
architect
of
this
building
from
that
time
i
resolved
never
to
argue
happy
helvetia
to
what
charter
do
you
owe
your
liberty
to
your
courage
to
your
resolution
to
your
mountains
but
i
am
your
emperor
but
i
do
not
want
you
any
longer
but
your
fathers
were
my
father
slaves
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
their
children
do
not
wish
to
serve
you
but
i
had
the
right
belonging
to
my
rank
and
we
have
the
right
of
nature
why
is
liberty
so
rare
because
it
is
the
chiefest
good
definition
history
is
the
recital
of
facts
given
as
true
in
contradistinction
to
the
fable
which
is
the
recital
of
facts
given
as
false
there
is
the
history
of
opinions
which
is
hardly
anything
but
a
collection
of
human
errors
the
history
of
the
arts
can
be
the
most
useful
of
all
when
it
joins
to
the
knowledge
of
the
invention
and
the
progress
of
the
arts
the
description
of
their
mechanism
natural
history
improperly
called
is
an
essential
part
of
natural
philosophy
the
history
of
events
has
been
divided
into
sacred
history
and
profane
history
sacred
history
is
a
series
of
divine
and
miraculous
operations
whereby
it
pleased
god
once
on
a
time
to
lead
the
jewish
nation
and
to
exercise
our
faith
first
foundations
of
history
the
first
foundations
of
all
history
are
the
recitals
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
transmitted
afterward
from
one
generation
to
another
at
their
origin
they
are
at
the
very
most
probable
when
they
do
not
shock
common
sense
and
they
lose
one
degree
of
probability
in
each
generation
with
time
the
fable
grows
and
the
truth
grows
less
from
this
it
comes
that
all
the
origins
of
peoples
are
absurd
thus
the
egyptians
had
been
governed
by
the
gods
for
many
centuries
then
they
had
been
governed
by
finally
they
had
had
kings
for
eleven
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
years
and
in
that
space
of
time
the
sun
had
changed
four
times
from
east
to
west
the
phoenicians
of
alexander
time
claimed
to
have
been
established
in
their
country
for
thirty
thousand
years
and
these
thirty
thousand
years
were
filled
with
as
many
prodigies
as
the
egyptian
chronology
i
avow
that
physically
it
is
very
possible
that
phoenicia
has
existed
not
merely
thirty
thousand
years
but
thirty
thousand
milliards
of
centuries
and
that
it
experienced
like
the
rest
of
the
world
thirty
million
revolutions
but
we
have
no
knowledge
of
it
one
knows
what
a
ridiculously
marvellous
state
of
affairs
ruled
in
the
ancient
history
of
the
greeks
the
romans
for
all
that
they
were
serious
did
not
any
the
less
envelop
the
history
of
their
early
centuries
in
fables
this
nation
so
recent
compared
with
the
asiatic
peoples
was
five
hundred
years
without
historians
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
romulus
was
the
son
of
mars
that
a
was
his
foster
mother
that
he
marched
with
a
thousand
men
of
his
village
of
rome
against
thousand
combatants
of
the
village
of
the
sabines
that
later
he
became
a
god
that
tarquin
the
ancient
cut
a
stone
with
a
razor
and
that
a
vestal
drew
a
ship
to
land
with
her
girdle
etc
the
early
annals
of
all
our
modern
nations
are
no
less
fabulous
the
prodigious
and
improbable
things
must
sometimes
be
reported
but
as
proofs
of
human
credulity
they
enter
the
history
of
opinions
and
foolishnesses
but
the
field
is
too
vast
of
records
in
order
to
know
with
a
little
certainty
something
of
ancient
history
there
is
only
one
means
it
is
to
see
if
any
incontestable
records
remain
we
have
only
three
in
writing
the
first
is
the
collection
of
astronomical
observations
made
for
nineteen
hundred
consecutive
years
at
babylon
sent
by
alexander
to
greece
this
series
of
observations
which
goes
back
to
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
years
before
our
era
proves
invincibly
that
the
babylonians
existed
as
a
body
of
people
several
centuries
before
for
the
arts
are
only
the
work
of
time
and
men
natural
laziness
leaves
them
for
some
thousands
of
years
without
other
knowledge
and
without
other
talents
than
those
of
feeding
themselves
of
defending
themselves
against
the
injuries
of
the
air
and
of
slaughtering
each
other
let
us
judge
by
the
germans
and
by
the
english
in
cæsar
time
by
the
tartars
by
the
of
africa
and
by
all
the
peoples
we
have
found
in
america
excepting
in
some
respects
the
kingdoms
of
peru
and
of
mexico
and
the
republic
of
tlascala
let
us
remember
that
in
the
whole
of
this
new
world
nobody
knew
how
to
read
or
write
the
second
record
is
the
central
eclipse
of
the
sun
calculated
in
china
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
years
before
our
era
and
recognized
true
by
our
astronomers
of
the
chinese
the
same
thing
must
be
said
as
of
the
peoples
of
babylon
they
already
comprised
a
vast
civilized
empire
without
a
doubt
but
what
puts
the
chinese
above
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
is
that
neither
their
laws
nor
their
customs
nor
the
language
spoken
among
them
by
their
lettered
mandarins
has
changed
for
about
four
thousand
years
nevertheless
this
nation
and
the
nation
of
india
the
most
ancient
of
all
those
that
exist
which
possess
the
vastest
and
the
most
beautiful
country
which
invented
almost
all
the
arts
before
we
had
learned
any
of
them
have
always
been
omitted
right
to
our
days
in
all
universal
histories
and
when
a
spaniard
and
a
frenchman
took
a
census
of
the
nations
neither
one
nor
the
other
failed
to
call
his
country
the
first
monarchy
in
the
world
and
his
king
the
greatest
king
in
the
world
flattering
himself
that
his
king
would
give
him
a
pension
as
soon
as
he
had
read
his
book
the
third
record
very
inferior
to
the
two
others
exists
in
the
arundel
marbles
the
chronicle
of
athens
is
graved
there
two
hundred
and
years
before
our
era
but
it
goes
back
only
to
cecrops
thirteen
hundred
and
nineteen
years
beyond
the
time
when
it
was
engraved
in
the
history
of
antiquity
those
are
the
sole
incontestable
epochs
that
we
have
let
us
give
serious
attention
to
these
marbles
brought
back
from
greece
by
lord
arundel
their
chronicle
begins
fifteen
hundred
and
years
before
our
era
that
is
an
antiquity
of
years
and
you
do
not
see
there
a
single
fact
touching
on
the
miraculous
on
the
prodigious
it
is
the
same
with
the
olympiads
it
is
not
there
that
one
should
say
lying
greece
the
greeks
knew
very
well
how
to
distinguish
between
history
and
fable
between
real
facts
and
the
tales
of
herodotus
just
as
in
their
serious
affairs
their
orators
borrowed
nothing
from
the
speeches
of
the
sophists
or
from
the
images
of
the
poets
the
date
of
the
taking
of
troy
is
specified
in
these
marbles
but
no
mention
is
made
of
apollo
arrows
or
of
the
sacrifice
of
iphigenia
or
of
the
ridiculous
combats
of
the
gods
the
date
of
the
inventions
of
triptolemy
and
ceres
is
found
there
but
ceres
is
not
called
mention
is
made
of
a
poem
on
the
abduction
of
prosperine
it
is
not
said
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
jupiter
and
a
goddess
and
that
she
is
wife
of
the
god
of
the
infernal
regions
hercules
is
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
eleusis
but
not
a
word
on
his
twelve
labours
nor
on
his
passage
into
africa
in
his
cup
nor
on
his
divinity
nor
on
the
big
fish
by
which
he
was
swallowed
and
which
kept
him
in
its
belly
three
days
and
three
nights
according
to
lycophron
among
us
on
the
contrary
a
standard
is
brought
from
heaven
by
an
angel
to
the
monks
of
a
pigeon
brings
a
bottle
of
oil
to
a
church
in
rheims
two
armies
of
snakes
give
themselves
over
to
a
pitched
battle
in
germany
an
archbishop
of
mayence
is
besieged
and
eaten
by
rats
and
to
crown
everything
great
care
has
been
taken
to
mark
the
year
of
these
adventures
all
history
is
recent
it
is
not
astonishing
that
we
have
no
ancient
profane
history
beyond
about
four
thousand
years
the
revolutions
of
this
globe
the
long
and
universal
ignorance
of
that
art
which
transmits
facts
by
writing
are
the
cause
of
it
this
art
was
common
only
among
a
very
small
number
of
civilized
nations
and
was
in
very
few
hands
even
nothing
rarer
among
the
french
and
the
germans
than
to
know
how
to
write
up
to
the
fourteenth
century
of
our
era
nearly
all
deeds
were
only
attested
by
witnesses
it
was
in
france
only
under
charles
in
that
one
started
to
draft
in
writing
some
of
the
customs
of
france
the
art
of
writing
was
still
rarer
among
the
spanish
and
from
that
it
results
that
their
history
is
so
dry
and
so
uncertain
up
to
the
time
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
one
sees
by
that
to
what
extent
the
very
small
number
of
men
who
knew
how
to
write
could
deceive
and
how
easy
it
was
to
make
us
believe
the
most
enormous
absurdities
there
are
nations
which
have
subjugated
a
part
of
the
world
without
having
the
usage
of
characters
we
know
that
conquered
a
part
of
asia
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
it
is
not
through
either
him
or
the
tartars
that
we
know
it
their
history
written
by
the
chinese
and
translated
by
father
gaubil
states
that
these
tartars
had
not
at
that
time
the
art
of
writing
this
art
can
not
have
been
less
unknown
to
the
scythian
oguskan
named
madies
by
the
persians
and
the
greeks
who
conquered
a
part
of
europe
and
asia
so
long
before
the
reign
of
cyrus
it
is
almost
certain
that
at
that
time
of
a
hundred
nations
there
were
hardly
two
or
three
who
used
characters
it
is
possible
that
in
an
ancient
world
destroyed
men
knew
writing
and
the
other
arts
but
in
ours
they
are
all
very
recent
there
remain
records
of
another
kind
which
serve
to
establish
merely
the
remote
antiquity
of
certain
peoples
and
which
precede
all
the
known
epochs
and
all
the
books
these
are
the
prodigies
of
architecture
like
the
pyramids
and
the
palaces
of
egypt
which
have
resisted
time
herodotus
who
lived
two
thousand
two
hundred
years
ago
and
who
had
seen
them
was
not
able
to
learn
from
the
egyptian
priests
at
what
time
they
had
been
erected
it
is
difficult
to
give
to
the
most
ancient
of
the
pyramids
less
than
four
thousand
years
of
antiquity
but
one
must
consider
that
these
efforts
of
the
ostentation
of
the
kings
could
only
have
been
commenced
long
after
the
establishment
of
the
towns
but
to
build
towns
in
a
land
inundated
every
year
let
us
always
remark
that
it
was
first
necessary
to
raise
the
land
of
the
towns
on
piles
in
this
land
of
mud
and
to
render
them
inaccessible
to
the
flood
it
was
essential
before
taking
this
necessary
course
and
before
being
in
a
state
to
attempt
these
great
works
for
the
people
to
have
practised
retreating
during
the
rising
of
the
nile
amid
the
rocks
which
form
two
chains
right
and
left
of
this
river
it
was
necessary
for
these
mustered
peoples
to
have
the
instruments
for
tilling
those
of
architecture
a
knowledge
of
surveying
with
laws
and
a
police
all
this
necessarily
requires
a
prodigious
space
of
time
we
see
by
the
long
details
which
face
every
day
the
most
necessary
and
the
smallest
of
our
undertakings
how
difficult
it
is
to
do
great
things
and
it
needs
not
only
indefatigable
stubbornness
but
several
generations
animated
with
this
stubbornness
however
whether
it
be
menes
thaut
or
cheops
or
rameses
who
erected
one
or
two
of
these
prodigious
masses
we
shall
not
be
the
more
instructed
of
the
history
of
ancient
egypt
the
language
of
this
people
is
lost
we
therefore
know
nothing
but
that
before
the
most
ancient
historians
there
was
matter
for
making
an
ancient
history
i
am
ignorant
of
how
i
was
formed
and
of
how
i
was
born
for
a
quarter
of
my
life
i
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
reasons
for
all
that
i
saw
heard
and
felt
and
i
was
nothing
but
a
parrot
at
whom
other
parrots
chattered
when
i
looked
round
me
and
within
me
i
conceived
that
something
exists
for
all
eternity
since
there
are
beings
who
exist
i
concluded
that
there
is
a
being
who
is
necessary
and
necessarily
eternal
thus
the
first
step
i
took
to
emerge
from
my
ignorance
crossed
the
boundaries
of
all
the
centuries
but
when
i
tried
to
walk
in
this
infinite
quarry
open
before
me
i
could
neither
find
a
single
path
nor
discern
plainly
a
single
object
and
from
the
leap
i
made
to
contemplate
eternity
i
fell
back
again
into
the
abyss
of
my
ignorance
i
saw
what
was
called
matter
from
the
star
sirius
and
the
stars
of
the
milky
way
as
distant
from
sirius
as
sirius
is
from
us
right
to
the
last
atom
that
can
be
perceived
with
the
microscope
and
i
am
ignorant
as
to
what
matter
is
the
light
which
let
me
see
all
these
beings
is
unknown
to
me
i
can
with
the
help
of
a
prism
dissect
this
light
and
divide
it
into
seven
pencils
of
rays
but
i
can
not
divide
these
pencils
i
am
ignorant
of
what
they
are
composed
light
is
of
the
nature
of
matter
since
it
has
movement
and
makes
an
impression
on
objects
but
it
does
not
tend
toward
a
centre
like
all
bodies
on
the
contrary
it
escapes
invincibly
from
the
centre
whereas
all
matter
bears
towards
its
centre
light
seems
penetrable
and
matter
is
impenetrable
is
this
light
matter
is
it
not
matter
with
what
innumerable
properties
can
it
be
endowed
i
am
ignorant
thereof
is
this
substance
which
is
so
brilliant
so
swift
and
so
unknown
are
these
other
substances
which
roll
in
the
immensity
of
space
eternal
as
they
seem
infinite
i
have
no
idea
has
a
necessary
being
of
sovereign
intelligence
created
them
out
of
nothing
or
has
he
arranged
them
did
he
produce
this
order
in
time
or
before
time
what
even
is
this
time
of
which
i
speak
i
can
not
define
it
o
god
teach
me
for
i
am
enlightened
neither
by
other
men
darkness
nor
by
my
own
what
is
sensation
how
have
i
received
it
what
connection
is
there
between
the
air
which
strikes
my
ear
and
the
sensation
of
sound
between
this
body
and
the
sensation
of
colour
i
am
profoundly
ignorant
thereof
and
i
shall
always
be
ignorant
thereof
what
is
thought
where
does
it
dwell
how
is
it
formed
who
gives
me
thought
during
my
sleep
is
it
by
virtue
of
my
will
that
i
think
but
always
during
my
sleep
and
often
while
i
am
awake
i
have
ideas
in
spite
of
myself
these
ideas
long
forgotten
long
relegated
to
the
back
shop
of
my
brain
issue
from
it
without
my
interfering
and
present
themselves
to
my
memory
which
makes
vain
efforts
to
recall
them
external
objects
have
not
the
power
to
form
ideas
in
me
for
one
does
not
give
oneself
what
one
has
not
i
am
too
sensible
that
it
is
not
i
who
give
them
to
me
for
they
are
born
without
my
orders
who
produces
them
in
me
whence
do
they
come
whither
do
they
go
fugitive
phantoms
what
invisible
hand
produces
you
and
causes
you
to
disappear
why
alone
of
all
animals
has
man
the
mania
for
dominating
his
why
and
how
has
it
been
possible
that
of
a
hundred
thousand
million
men
more
than
have
been
immolated
to
this
mania
how
is
reason
so
precious
a
gift
that
we
would
not
lose
it
for
anything
in
the
world
and
how
has
this
reason
served
only
to
make
us
the
most
unhappy
of
all
beings
whence
comes
it
that
loving
truth
passionately
we
are
always
betrayed
to
the
most
gross
impostures
why
is
life
still
loved
by
this
crowd
of
indians
deceived
and
enslaved
by
the
bonzes
crushed
by
a
tartar
descendants
overburdened
with
work
groaning
in
want
assailed
by
disease
exposed
to
every
scourge
whence
comes
evil
and
why
does
evil
exist
o
atoms
of
a
day
o
my
companions
in
infinite
littleness
born
like
me
to
suffer
everything
and
to
be
ignorant
of
everything
are
there
enough
madmen
among
you
to
believe
that
they
know
all
these
things
no
there
are
not
no
at
the
bottom
of
your
hearts
you
feel
your
nonentity
as
i
render
justice
to
mine
but
you
are
arrogant
enough
to
want
people
to
embrace
your
vain
systems
unable
to
be
tyrants
over
our
bodies
you
claim
to
be
tyrants
over
our
souls
who
are
the
impious
those
who
give
a
white
beard
feet
and
hands
to
the
being
of
beings
to
the
great
demiourgos
to
the
eternal
intelligence
by
which
nature
is
governed
but
they
are
only
excusably
impious
poor
impious
people
against
whom
one
must
not
grow
wroth
if
even
they
paint
the
great
incomprehensible
being
born
on
a
cloud
which
can
bear
nothing
if
they
are
foolish
enough
to
put
god
in
a
mist
in
the
rain
or
on
a
mountain
and
to
surround
him
with
little
chubby
flushed
faces
accompanied
by
two
wings
i
laugh
and
i
pardon
them
with
all
my
heart
the
impious
persons
who
attribute
to
the
being
of
beings
preposterous
predictions
and
injustices
would
anger
me
if
this
great
being
had
not
given
me
a
reason
which
quells
my
wrath
the
silly
fanatic
repeats
to
me
after
others
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
what
is
reasonable
and
just
in
the
great
being
that
his
reason
is
not
like
our
reason
that
his
justice
is
not
like
our
justice
eh
how
you
mad
demoniac
do
you
want
me
to
judge
justice
and
reason
otherwise
than
by
the
notions
i
have
of
them
do
you
want
me
to
walk
otherwise
than
with
my
feet
and
to
speak
otherwise
than
with
my
mouth
the
impious
man
who
supposes
the
great
being
jealous
arrogant
malignant
vindictive
is
more
dangerous
i
would
not
want
to
sleep
under
the
same
roof
as
this
man
but
how
would
you
treat
the
impious
man
who
says
to
you
see
only
through
my
eyes
do
not
think
i
announce
to
you
a
tyrannical
god
who
has
made
me
to
be
your
tyrant
i
am
his
during
all
eternity
he
will
torture
millions
of
his
creatures
whom
he
detests
in
order
to
gladden
me
i
shall
be
your
master
in
this
world
and
i
shall
laugh
at
your
torments
in
the
other
do
you
not
feel
an
itching
to
thrash
this
cruel
impious
fellow
if
you
are
born
gentle
will
you
not
run
with
all
your
might
to
the
west
when
this
barbarian
utters
his
atrocious
reveries
in
the
east
of
it
is
meet
that
the
reader
should
be
acquainted
with
the
true
history
of
joan
of
arc
surnamed
the
maid
the
details
of
her
adventure
are
very
little
known
and
may
give
readers
pleasure
here
they
are
paul
jove
says
that
the
courage
of
the
french
was
stimulated
by
this
girl
and
takes
good
care
not
to
believe
her
inspired
neither
robert
gaguin
paul
emile
polydore
vergile
genebrard
philip
of
bergamo
papyre
masson
nor
even
mariana
say
that
she
was
sent
by
god
and
even
though
mariana
the
jesuit
had
said
it
that
would
not
deceive
me
mézerai
relates
that
the
prince
of
the
celestial
militia
appeared
to
her
i
am
sorry
for
mézerai
and
i
ask
pardon
of
the
prince
of
the
celestial
militia
most
of
our
historians
who
copy
each
other
suppose
that
the
maid
uttered
prophecies
and
that
her
prophecies
were
accomplished
she
is
made
to
say
that
she
will
drive
the
english
out
of
the
kingdom
and
they
were
still
there
five
years
after
her
death
she
is
said
to
have
written
a
long
letter
to
the
king
of
england
and
assuredly
she
could
neither
read
nor
write
such
an
education
was
not
given
to
an
inn
servant
in
the
barois
and
the
information
laid
against
her
states
that
she
could
not
sign
her
name
but
it
is
said
she
found
a
rusted
sword
the
blade
of
which
was
engraved
with
five
golden
and
this
sword
was
hidden
in
the
church
of
sainte
catherine
de
fierbois
at
tours
there
certainly
is
a
great
miracle
poor
joan
of
arc
having
been
captured
by
the
english
despite
her
prophecies
and
her
miracles
maintained
first
of
all
in
her
that
catherine
and
marguerite
had
honoured
her
with
many
revelations
i
am
astonished
that
she
never
said
anything
of
her
talks
with
the
prince
of
the
celestial
militia
these
two
saints
apparently
liked
talking
better
than
michael
her
judges
thought
her
a
sorceress
she
thought
herself
inspired
one
great
proof
that
charles
vii
captains
made
use
of
the
marvellous
in
order
to
encourage
the
soldiers
in
the
deplorable
state
to
which
france
was
reduced
is
that
saintrailles
had
his
shepherd
as
the
comte
de
dunois
had
his
shepherdess
the
shepherd
made
prophecies
on
one
side
while
the
shepherdess
made
them
on
the
other
but
unfortunately
the
comte
de
dunois
prophetess
was
captured
at
the
siege
of
compiègne
by
a
bastard
of
vendôme
and
saintrailles
prophet
was
captured
by
talbot
the
gallant
talbot
was
far
from
having
the
shepherd
burned
this
talbot
was
one
of
those
true
englishmen
who
scorn
superstition
and
who
have
not
the
fanaticism
for
punishing
fanatics
this
it
seems
to
me
is
what
the
historians
should
have
observed
and
what
they
have
neglected
the
maid
was
taken
to
jean
de
luxembourg
comte
de
ligny
she
was
shut
up
in
the
fortress
of
beaulieu
then
in
that

he
claimed
by
a
downright
lie
joan
had
been
captured
on
the
territory
of
the
bishopric
of
noyon
and
neither
the
bishop
of
beauvais
nor
the
bishop
of
noyon
assuredly
had
the
right
of
condemning
anybody
and
still
less
of
committing
to
death
a
subject
of
the
duke

lorraine
and
a
warrior
in
the
pay
of
the

there
was
at
that
time
who
would
believe
it
a
of
the
inquisition
in
france
by
name
brother
martin
it
was
one
of
the
most
horrible
effects
of
the
total
subversion
of
that
unfortunate
country
brother
martin
claimed
the
prisoner
as
smelling
of
heresy
he
called
upon

the

of
his

and
of
the
authority
given

hastened
to
support

and
wrote
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
to
jean
de
luxembourg
you
have
used
your
noble
power
to
apprehend
this
woman
who
calls
herself
the
maid
by
means
of
whom
the
honour
of
god
has
been
immeasurably
offended
the
faith
exceedingly
hurt
and
the
church
too
greatly
dishonoured
for
by
reason
of
her
idolatry
errors
bad
doctrine
and
other
inestimable
evils
have
ensued
in
this
kingdom
but
what
this
woman
has
done
would
be
of
small
account
if
did
not
ensue
what
is
meet
for
satisfying
the
offence
perpetrated
by
her
against
our
gentle
creator
and
his
faith
and
the
holy
church
with
her
other
innumerable
misdeeds
and
it
would
be
intolerable
offence
against
the
divine
majesty
if
it
happened
that
this
woman
were
freed
finally
the
maid
was
awarded
to
jean
cauchon
whom
people
called
the
unworthy
bishop
the
unworthy
frenchman
and
the
unworthy
man
jean
de
luxembourg
sold
the
maid
to
cauchon
and
the
english
for
ten
thousand
livres
and
the
duke
of
bedford
paid
them
the
sorbonne
the
bishop
and
brother
martin
then
presented
a
new
petition
to
this
duke
of
bedford
regent
of
france
in
honour
of
our
lord
and
saviour
jesus
christ
for
that
the
said
joan
may
be
briefly
put
into
the
hands
of
the
church
joan
was
led
to
rouen
the
archbishopric
was
vacant
at
that
time
and
the
chapter
permitted
the
bishop
of
beauvais
to
in
the
town
is
the
term
which
was
used
he
chose
as
assessors
nine
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
with
other
assistants
abbots
or
monks
the
vicar
of
the
inquisition
martin
presided
with
cauchon
and
as
he
was
only
a
vicar
he
had
but
second
place
joan
underwent
fourteen
examinations
they
are
singular
she
said
that
she
saw
catherine
and
marguerite
at
poitiers
doctor
beaupère
asks
her
how
she
recognized
the
saints
she
answers
that
it
was
by
their
way
of
bowing
beaupère
asks
her
if
they
are
great
chatterboxes
go
look
on
the
register
she
says
beaupère
asks
her
if
when
she
saw
michael
he
was
naked
she
answers
do
you
think
our
lord
had
nothing
to
clothe
him
with
the
curious
will
carefully
observe
here
that
joan
had
long
been
directed
with
other
religious
women
of
the
populace
by
a
rogue
named
richard
who
performed
miracles
and
who
taught
these
girls
to
perform
them
one
day
he
gave
communion
three
times
in
succession
to
joan
in
honour
of
the
trinity
it
was
then
the
custom
in
matters
of
importance
and
in
times
of
great
peril
the
knights
had
three
masses
said
and
communicated
three
times
when
they
went
to
seek
fortune
or
to
fight
in
a
duel
it
is
what
has
been
observed
on
the
part
of
the
chevalier
bayard
the
workers
of
miracles
joan
companions
who
were
submissive
to
richard
were
named
pierrone
and
catherine
pierrone
affirmed
that
she
had
seen
that
god
appeared
to
her
in
human
form
as
a
friend
to
a
friend
god
was
clad
in
a
long
white
robe
etc
up
to
the
present
the
ridiculous
here
now
is
the
horrible
one
of
joan
judges
doctor
of
theology
and
priest
by
name
nicholas
comes
to
confess
her
in
prison
he
abuses
the
sacrament
to
the
point
of
hiding
behind
a
piece
of
serge
two
priests
who
transcribed
joan
of
arc
confession
thus
did
the
judges
use
sacrilege
in
order
to
be
murderers
and
an
unfortunate
idiot
who
had
had
enough
courage
to
render
very
great
services
to
the
king
and
the
country
was
condemned
to
be
burned
by
french
priests
who
immolated
her
for
the
english
faction
it
is
sufficiently
how
someone
had
the
cunning
and
meanness
to
put
a
man
suit
beside
her
to
tempt
her
to
wear
this
suit
again
and
with
what
absurd
barbarism
this
transgression
was
claimed
as
a
pretext
for
condemning
her
to
the
flames
as
if
in
a
warrior
girl
it
was
a
crime
worthy
of
the
fire
to
put
on
breeches
instead
of
a
skirt
all
this
wrings
the
heart
and
makes
common
sense
shudder
one
can
not
conceive
how
we
dare
after
the
countless
horrors
of
which
we
have
been
guilty
call
any
nation
by
the
name
of
barbarian
most
of
our
historians
lovers
of
the
embellishments
of
history
rather
than
of
truth
say
that
joan
went
fearlessly
to
the
torture
but
as
the
chronicles
of
the
times
bear
witness
and
as
the
historian
villaret
admits
she
received
her
sentence
with
cries
and
tears
a
weakness
pardonable
in
her
sex
and
perhaps
in
ours
and
very
compatible
with
the
courage
which
this
girl
had
displayed
amid
the
dangers
of
war
for
one
can
be
fearless
in
battle
and
sensitive
on
the
scaffold
i
must
add
that
many
persons
have
believed
without
any
examination
that
the
maid
of
orleans
was
not
burned
at
rouen
at
all
although
we
have
the
official
report
of
her
execution
they
have
been
deceived
by
the
account
we
still
have
of
an
adventuress
who
took
the
name
of
the
maid
deceived
joan
of
arc
brothers
and
under
cover
of
this
imposture
married
in
lorraine
a
nobleman
of
the
house
of
armoise
there
were
two
other
rogues
who
also
passed
themselves
off
as
the
maid
of
orleans
all
three
claimed
that
joan
was
not
burned
at
all
and
that
another
woman
had
been
substituted
for
her
such
stories
can
be
admitted
only
by
those
who
want
to
be
deceived

beuchot

that
he

it

by
quinault

really

what
you
keep

of
your

act
sc
the
valets
always
used
to
ask
kisses
of
the
soubrettes
people
kissed
each
other
on
the
stage
usually
it
was
very
dull
and
very
intolerable
particularly
in
the
case
of
ugly
actors
who
were
nauseating
if
the
reader
wants
kisses
let
him
look
for
them
in
the
pastor
fido
there
is
one
entire
chorus
where
nothing
but
kisses
is
mentioned
and
the
piece
is
founded
solely
on
a
kiss
that
mirtillo
gave
one
day
to
amarilli
in
a
game
of
blind
man
buff
bacio
molto
everyone
knows
the
chapter
on
kisses
in
which
jean
de
la
casa
archbishop
of
benevento
says
that
people
can
kiss
each
other
from
head
to
foot
he
pities
the
people
with
big
noses
who
can
only
approach
each
other
with
difficulty
and
he
counsels
ladies
with
long
noses
to
have
lovers
the
kiss
was
a
very
ordinary
form
of
salutation
throughout
ancient
times
plutarch
recalls
that
the
conspirators
before
killing
cæsar
kissed
his
face
hand
and
breast
tacitus
says
that
when
agricola
his
returned
from
rome
domitian
received
him
with
a
cold
kiss
said
nothing
to
him
and
left
him
confounded
in
the
crowd
the
inferior
who
could
not
succeed
in
greeting
his
superior
by
kissing
him
put
his
mouth
to
his
own
hand
and
sent
him
a
kiss
that
the
other
returned
in
the
same
way
if
he
so
wished
this
sign
was
used
even
for
worshipping
the
gods
job
in
his
parable
chap
xxxi
which
is
perhaps
the
oldest
of
known
books
says
that
he
has
not
worshipped
the
sun
and
the
moon
like
the
other
arabs
that
he
has
not
carried
his
hand
to
his
mouth
as
he
looked
at
the
stars
in
our
occident
nothing
remains
of
this
ancient
custom
but
the
puerile
and
genteel
civility
that
is
still
taught
to
children
in
some
small
towns
of
kissing
their
right
hands
when
someone
has
given
them
some
sweets
it
was
a
horrible
thing
to
betray
with
a
kiss
it
was
that
that
made
cæsar
assassination
still
more
hateful
we
know
all
about
kisses
they
have
become
proverbial
joab
one
of
david
captains
being
very
jealous
of
amasa
another
captain
says
to
him
sam
xx
art
thou
in
health
my
brother
and
he
took
amasa
by
the
beard
with
the
right
hand
to
kiss
him
and
with
his
other
hand
drew
his
sword
and
smote
him
therewith
in
the
fifth
rib
and
shed
out
his
bowels
on
the
ground
no
other
kiss
is
to
be
found
in
the
other
fairly
frequent
assassinations
which
were
committed
among
the
jews
unless
it
be
perhaps
the
kisses
which
judith
gave
to
the
captain
holophernes
before
cutting
off
his
head
while
he
was
in
bed
asleep
but
no
mention
is
made
of
them
and
the
thing
is
merely
probable
in
one
of
shakespeare
tragedies
called
othello
this
othello
who
is
a
black
gives
two
kisses
to
his
wife
before
strangling
her
that
seems
abominable
to
honourable
people
but
shakespeare
partisans
say
it
is
beautifully
natural
particularly
in
a
black
when
giovanni
galeas
sforza
was
assassinated
in
milan
cathedral
on
stephen
day
the
two
medici
in
the
reparata
church
admiral
coligny
the
prince
of
orange
the
maréchal
the
brothers
witt
and
so
many
others
at
least
they
were
not
kissed
there
was
among
the
ancients
i
know
not
what
of
symbolic
and
sacred
attached
to
the
kiss
since
one
kissed
the
statues
of
the
gods
and
their
beards
when
the
sculptors
had
shown
them
with
a
beard
initiates
kissed
each
other
at
the
mysteries
of
ceres
as
a
sign
of
concord
the
early
christians
men
and
women
kissed
each
other
on
the
mouth
at
their
this
word
signified
they
gave
each
other
the
holy
kiss
the
kiss
of
peace
the
kiss
of
brother
and
sister
this
custom
lasted
for
more
than
four
centuries
and
was
abolished
at
last
on
account
of
its
consequences
it
was
these
kisses
of
peace
these
agapæ
of
love
these
names
of
brother
and
sister
that
long
drew
to
the
christians
those
imputations
of
debauchery
with
which
the
priests
of
jupiter
and
the
priestesses
of
vesta
charged
them
you
see
in
petronius
and
in
other
profane
authors
that
the
libertines
called
themselves
brother
and
sister
it
was
thought
that
among
the
christians
the
same
names
signified
the
same
infamies
they
were
innocent
accomplices
in
spreading
these
accusations
over
the
roman
empire
there
were
in
the
beginning
seventeen
different
christian
societies
just
as
there
were
nine
among
the
jews
including
the
two
kinds
of
samaritans
the
societies
which
flattered
themselves
at
being
the
most
orthodox
accused
the
others
of
the
most
inconceivable
obscenities
the
term
of
gnostic
which
was
at
first
so
honourable
signifying
learned
enlightened
pure
became
a
term
of
horror
and
scorn
a
reproach
of
heresy
saint
epiphanius
in
the
third
century
claimed
that
they
used
first
to
tickle
each
other
the
men
and
the
women
that
then
they
gave
each
other
very
immodest
kisses
and
that
they
judged
the
degree
of
their
faith
by
the
voluptuousness
of
these
kisses
that
the
husband
said
to
his
wife
in
presenting
a
young
initiate
to
her
have
an
agape
with
my
brother
and
that
they
had
an
agape
we
do
not
dare
repeat
here
in
the
chaste
french
tongue
what
saint
epiphanius
adds
in
greek
epiphanius
lib
vol
ii
we
will
say
merely
that
perhaps
this
saint
was
somewhat
imposed
upon
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
too
carried
away
by
zeal
and
that
all
heretics
are
not
hideous
debauchees
the
sect
of
pietists
wishing
to
imitate
the
early
christians
give
each
other
kisses
of
peace
on
leaving
the
assembly
calling
each
other
my
brother
my
sister
it
is
what
twenty
years
ago
a
very
pretty
and
very
human
pietist
lady
avowed
to
me
the
ancient
custom
was
to
kiss
on
the
mouth
the
pietists
have
carefully
preserved
it
there
was
no
other
manner
of
greeting
dames
in
france
germany
italy
england
it
was
the
right
of
cardinals
to
kiss
queens
on
the
mouth
and
in
spain
even
what
is
singular
is
that
they
had
not
the
same
prerogative
in
france
where
ladies
always
had
more
liberty
than
anywhere
else
but
every
country
has
its
ceremonies
and
there
is
no
usage
so
general
that
chance
and
custom
have
not
provided
exceptions
it
would
have
been
an
incivility
an
affront
for
an
honourable
woman
when
she
received
a
lord
first
visit
not
to
have
kissed
him
despite
his
moustaches
it
is
a
displeasing
custom
says
montaigne
book
chap
and
offensive
to
ladies
to
have
to
lend
their
lips
to
whoever
has
three
in
his
suite
disagreeable
though
he
be
this
custom
was
nevertheless
the
oldest
in
the
world
if
it
is
disagreeable
for
a
young
and
pretty
mouth
to
stick
itself
out
of
courtesy
to
an
old
and
ugly
mouth
there
was
a
great
danger
between
fresh
red
mouths
of
twenty
to
years
old
and
that
is
what
finally
brought
about
the
abolition
of
the
ceremony
of
kissing
in
the
mysteries
and
the
agapæ
it
is
what
caused
women
to
be
confined
among
the
orientals
so
that
they
might
kiss
only
their
fathers
and
their
brothers
custom
long
since
introduced
into
spain
by
the
arabs
behold
the
danger
there
is
one
nerve
of
the
fifth
pair
which
goes
from
the
mouth
to
the
heart
and
thence
lower
down
with
such
delicate
industry
has
nature
prepared
everything
the
little
glands
of
the
lips
their
spongy
tissue
their
velvety
paps
the
fine
skin
ticklish
gives
them
an
exquisite
and
voluptuous
sensation
which
is
not
without
analogy
with
a
still
more
hidden
and
still
more
sensitive
part
modesty
may
suffer
from
a
lengthily
savoured
kiss
between
two
pietists
of
eighteen
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
human
species
the
turtledoves
and
the
pigeons
alone
are
acquainted
with
kisses
thence
came
among
the
latins
the
word
which
our
language
has
not
been
able
to
render
there
is
nothing
of
which
abuse
has
not
been
made
the
kiss
designed
by
nature
for
the
mouth
has
often
been
prostituted
to
membranes
which
do
not
seem
made
for
this
usage
one
knows
of
what
the
templars
were
accused
we
can
not
honestly
treat
this
interesting
subject
at
greater
length
although
montaigne
says
one
should
speak
thereof
shamelessly
brazenly
do
we
utter
but
of
that
we
dare
not
speak
but
with
bated
breath
footnotes
or
the
english
there
is
no
complete
language
no
language
which
can
express
all
our
ideas
and
all
our
sensations
their
shades
are
too
numerous
too
imperceptible
nobody
can
make
known
the
precise
degree
of
sensation
he
experiences
one
is
obliged
for
example
to
designate
by
the
general
names
of
love
and
hate
a
thousand
loves
and
a
thousand
hates
all
different
from
each
other
it
is
the
same
with
our
pleasures
and
our
pains
thus
all
languages
are
like
us
imperfect
they
have
all
been
made
successively
and
by
degrees
according
to
our
needs
it
is
the
instinct
common
to
all
men
which
made
the
first
grammars
without
perceiving
it
the
lapps
the
negroes
as
well
as
the
greeks
needed
to
express
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
and
they
did
it
but
as
there
has
never
been
an
assembly
of
logicians
who
formed
a
language
no
language
has
been
able
to
attain
a
perfectly
regular
plan
all
words
in
all
possible
languages
are
necessarily
the
images
of
sensations
men
have
never
been
able
to
express
anything
but
what
they
felt
thus
everything
has
become
metaphor
everywhere
the
soul
is
enlightened
the
heart
burns
the
mind
wanders
among
all
peoples
the
infinite
has
been
the
negation
of
the
finite
immensity
the
negation
of
measure
it
is
evident
that
our
five
senses
have
produced
all
languages
as
well
as
all
our
ideas
the
least
imperfect
are
like
the
laws
those
in
which
there
is
the
least
that
is
arbitrary
are
the
best
the
most
complete
are
necessarily
those
of
the
peoples
who
have
cultivated
the
arts
and
society
thus
the
hebraic
language
should
be
one
of
the
poorest
languages
like
the
people
who
used
to
speak
it
how
should
the
hebrews
have
had
maritime
terms
they
who
before
solomon
had
not
a
boat
how
the
terms
of
philosophy
they
who
were
plunged
in
such
profound
ignorance
up
to
the
time
when
they
started
to
learn
something
in
their
migration
to
babylon
the
language
of
the
phoenicians
from
which
the
hebrews
drew
their
jargon
should
be
very
superior
because
it
was
the
idiom
of
an
industrious
commercial
rich
people
distributed
all
over
the
earth
the
most
ancient
known
language
should
be
that
of
the
nation
most
anciently
gathered
together
as
a
body
of
people
it
should
be
further
that
of
the
people
which
has
been
least
subjugated
or
which
having
been
subjugated
has
civilized
its
conquerors
and
in
this
respect
it
is
constant
that
chinese
and
arabic
are
the
most
ancient
of
all
those
that
are
spoken
there
is
no
all
neighbouring
nations
have
borrowed
from
each
other
but
one
has
given
the
name
of
to
those
from
which
some
known
idioms
are
derived
for
example
latin
is
the
in
respect
of
italian
spanish
and
french
but
it
was
itself
derived
from
tuscan
and
tuscan
was
derived
from
celtic
and
greek
the
most
beautiful
of
all
languages
must
be
that
which
is
at
once
the
most
complete
the
most
sonorous
the
most
varied
in
its
twists
and
the
most
regular
in
its
progress
that
which
has
most
compound
words
that
which
by
its
prosody
best
expresses
the
soul
slow
or
impetuous
movements
that
which
most
resembles
music
greek
has
all
these
advantages
it
has
not
the
roughness
of
latin
in
which
so
many
words
end
in
it
has
all
the
pomp
of
spanish
and
all
the
sweetness
of
italian
it
has
above
all
the
living
languages
of
the
world
the
expression
of
music
by
long
and
short
syllables
and
by
the
number
and
variety
of
its
accents
thus
all
disfigured
as
it
is
in
greece
it
can
still
be
regarded
as
the
most
beautiful
language
in
the
universe
the
most
beautiful
language
can
not
be
the
most
widely
distributed
when
the
people
which
speaks
it
is
oppressed
not
numerous
without
commerce
with
other
nations
and
when
these
other
nations
have
cultivated
their
own
languages
thus
greek
should
be
less
diffused
than
arabic
and
even
turkish
of
all
european
languages
french
should
be
the
most
general
because
it
is
the
most
suited
to
conversation
it
has
taken
its
character
from
that
of
the
people
which
speaks
it
the
french
have
been
for
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
people
which
has
best
known
society
which
the
first
discarded
all
embarrassment
and
the
first
among
whom
women
were
free
and
even
sovereign
when
elsewhere
they
were
only
slaves
the
always
uniform
syntax
of
this
language
which
admits
no
inversions
is
a
further
facility
barely
possessed
by
other
tongues
it
is
more
current
coin
than
others
even
though
it
lacks
weight
the
prodigious
quantity
of
agreeably
frivolous
books
which
this
nation
has
produced
is
a
further
reason
for
the
favour
which
its
language
has
obtained
among
all
nations
profound
books
will
not
give
vogue
to
a
language
they
will
be
translated
people
will
learn
newton
philosophy
but
they
will
not
learn
english
in
order
to
understand
it
what
makes
french
still
more
common
is
the
perfection
to
which
the
drama
has
been
carried
in
this
tongue
it
is
to
cinna
phèdre
the
misanthrope
that
it
owes
its
vogue
and
not
to
the
conquests
of
louis
xiv
it
is
not
so
copious
and
so
flexible
as
italian
or
so
majestic
as
spanish
or
so
energetic
as
english
and
yet
it
has
had
more
success
than
these
three
languages
from
the
sole
fact
that
it
is
more
suited
to
intercourse
and
that
there
are
more
agreeable
books
in
it
than
elsewhere
it
has
succeeded
like
the
cooks
of
france
because
it
has
more
flattered
general
taste
the
same
spirit
which
has
led
the
nations
to
imitate
the
french
in
their
furniture
in
the
arrangement
of
rooms
in
gardens
in
dancing
in
all
that
gives
charm
has
led
them
also
to
speak
their
language
the
great
art
of
good
french
writers
is
precisely
that
of
the
women
of
this
nation
who
dress
better
than
the
other
women
of
europe
and
who
without
being
more
beautiful
appear
to
be
so
by
the
art
with
which
they
adorn
themselves
by
the
noble
and
simple
charm
they
give
themselves
so
naturally
it
is
by
dint
of
good
breeding
that
this
language
has
managed
to
make
the
traces
of
its
former
barbarism
disappear
everything
would
bear
witness
to
this
barbarism
to
whosoever
should
look
closely
one
would
see
that
the
number
comes
from
and
that
formerly
this
and
this
were
pronounced
with
a
roughness
characteristic
of
all
the
northern
nations
of
the
month
of
has
been
made
the
month
of
not
so
long
ago
a
german
prince
thinking
that
in
france
one
never
pronounced
the
term
otherwise
called
king
auguste
of
poland
king
août
all
the
letters
which
have
been
suppressed
in
pronunciation
but
retained
in
writing
are
our
former
barbarous
clothes
it
was
when
manners
were
softened
that
the
language
also
was
softened
before
françois
ier
summoned
women
to
his
court
it
was
as
clownish
as
we
were
it
would
have
been
as
good
to
speak
old
celtic
as
the
french
of
the
time
of
charles
viii
and
louis
xii
german
was
not
more
harsh
it
has
taken
centuries
to
remove
this
rust
the
imperfections
which
remain
would
still
be
intolerable
were
it
not
for
the
continual
care
one
takes
to
avoid
them
as
a
skilful
horseman
avoids
stones
in
the
road
good
writers
are
careful
to
combat
the
faulty
expressions
which
popular
ignorance
first
brings
into
vogue
and
which
adopted
by
bad
authors
then
pass
into
the
gazettes
and
the
pamphlets
signifies
in
english
and
our
waiters
talk
to
us
nowadays
of
a
roastbeef
of
mutton
means
coat
for
going
on
of
it
people
have
made
and
the
populace
thinks
it
an
ancient
word
of
the
language
it
has
been
necessary
to
adopt
this
expression
with
the
people
because
it
signifies
an
article
of
common
use
in
matters
of
arts
and
crafts
and
necessary
things
the
common
people
subjugated
the
court
if
one
dare
say
so
just
as
in
matters
of
religion
those
who
most
despise
the
common
run
of
people
are
obliged
to
speak
and
to
appear
to
think
like
them
to
call
things
by
the
names
which
the
common
people
has
imposed
on
them
is
not
to
speak
badly
but
one
recognizes
a
people
naturally
more
ingenious
than
another
by
the
proper
names
which
it
gives
to
each
thing
it
is
only
through
lack
of
imagination
that
a
people
adapts
the
same
expression
to
a
hundred
different
ideas
it
is
a
ridiculous
sterility
not
to
have
known
how
to
express
otherwise
arm
of
the
scale
arm
of
a
there
is
poverty
of
thought
in
saying
equally
the
of
a
the
of
an
ignorance
has
introduced
another
custom
into
all
modern
languages
a
thousand
terms
no
longer
signify
what
they
should
signify
meant
it
means
signified
it
is
the
festival
of
three
kings
is
to
dip
in
water
we
say
with
the
of
john
or
james
to
these
defects
in
almost
all
languages
are
added
barbarous
irregularities
venus
is
a
charming
name
is
abominable
another
result
of
the
irregularity
of
these
languages
composed
at
hazard
in
uncouth
times
is
the
quantity
of
compound
words
of
which
the
simple
form
does
not
exist
any
more
they
are
children
who
have
lost
their
father
we
have
and
no
there
are
things
which
are
and
none
which
are
one
is
one
is
not
there
are
fellows
fellows
but
neither
fellows
nor
fellows
all
languages
more
or
less
retain
some
of
these
defects
they
are
all
irregular
lands
from
which
the
hand
of
the
adroit
artist
knows
how
to
derive
advantage
other
defects
which
make
a
nation
character
evident
always
slip
into
languages
in
france
there
are
fashions
in
expressions
as
in
ways
of
doing
the
hair
a
fashionable
invalid
or
doctor
will
take
it
into
his
head
to
say
that
he
has
had
a
of
fever
to
signify
that
he
has
had
a
slight
attack
soon
the
whole
nation
has
of
colics
of
hatred
love
ridicule
preachers
in
the
pulpit
tell
you
that
you
must
have
at
least
a
of
god
love
after
a
few
months
this
fashion
gives
place
to
another
what
does
most
harm
to
the
nobility
of
the
language
is
not
this
passing
fashion
with
which
people
are
soon
disgusted
not
the
solecisms
of
fashionable
people
into
which
good
authors
do
not
fall
but
the
affectation
of
mediocre
authors
in
speaking
of
serious
things
in
a
conversational
style
everything
conspires
to
corrupt
a
language
that
is
rather
widely
diffused
authors
who
spoil
the
style
by
affectation
those
who
write
to
foreign
countries
and
who
almost
always
mingle
foreign
expressions
with
their
natural
tongue
merchants
who
introduce
into
conversation
their
business
terms
all
languages
being
imperfect
it
does
not
follow
that
one
should
change
them
one
must
adhere
absolutely
to
the
manner
in
which
the
good
authors
have
spoken
them
and
when
one
has
a
sufficient
number
of
approved
authors
a
language
is
fixed
thus
one
can
no
longer
change
anything
in
italian
spanish
english
french
without
corrupting
them
the
reason
is
clear
it
is
that
one
would
soon
render
unintelligible
the
books
which
provide
the
instruction
and
the
pleasure
of
the
nations
sheep
live
very
placidly
in
community
they
are
considered
very
because
we
do
not
see
the
prodigious
quantity
of
animals
they
devour
it
is
even
to
be
believed
that
they
eat
them
innocently
and
without
knowing
it
like
us
when
we
eat
a
sassenage
cheese
the
republic
of
the
sheep
is
a
faithful
representation
of
the
golden
age
a
is
visibly
the
most
perfect
monarchic
state
there
is
no
king
comparable
to
a
cock
if
he
marches
proudly
in
the
midst
of
his
people
it
is
not
out
of
vanity
if
the
enemy
approaches
he
does
not
give
orders
to
his
subjects
to
go
to
kill
themselves
for
him
by
virtue
of
his
certain
knowledge
and
plenary
power
he
goes
to
battle
himself
ranges
his
chickens
behind
him
and
fights
to
the
death
if
he
is
the
victor
he
himself
sings
the
in
civil
life
there
is
no
one
so
gallant
so
honest
so
disinterested
he
has
all
the
virtues
has
he
in
his
royal
beak
a
grain
of
corn
a
grub
he
gives
it
to
the
first
lady
among
his
subjects
who
presents
herself
solomon
in
his
harem
did
not
come
near
a
cock
if
it
be
true
that
the
bees
are
governed
by
a
queen
to
whom
all
her
subjects
make
love
that
is
a
still
more
perfect
government
the
ants
are
considered
to
be
an
excellent
democracy
democracy
is
above
all
the
other
states
because
there
everyone
is
equal
and
each
individual
works
for
the
good
of
all
the
republic
of
the
beavers
is
still
superior
to
that
of
the
ants
at
least
if
we
judge
by
their
masonry
work
the
monkeys
resemble
strolling
players
rather
than
a
civilized
people
and
they
do
not
appear
to
be
gathered
together
under
fixed
fundamental
laws
like
the
preceding
species
we
resemble
the
monkeys
more
than
any
other
animal
by
the
gift
of
imitation
the
frivolity
of
our
ideas
and
by
our
inconstancy
which
has
never
allowed
us
to
have
uniform
and
durable
laws
when
nature
formed
our
species
and
gave
us
instincts
for
our
preservation
benevolence
for
the
preservation
of
others
love
which
is
common
to
all
the
species
and
the
inexplicable
gift
of
combining
more
ideas
than
all
the
animals
together
when
she
had
thus
given
us
our
portion
she
said
to
us
do
as
you
can
there
is
no
good
code
in
any
country
the
reason
for
this
is
evident
the
laws
have
been
made
according
to
the
times
the
place
and
the
need
etc
when
the
needs
have
changed
the
laws
which
have
remained
have
become
ridiculous
thus
the
law
which
forbade
the
eating
of
pig
and
the
drinking
of
wine
was
very
reasonable
in
arabia
where
pig
and
wine
are
injurious
it
is
absurd
at
constantinople
the
law
which
gives
the
whole
fee
to
the
eldest
son
is
very
good
in
times
of
anarchy
and
pillage
then
the
eldest
son
is
the
captain
of
the
castle
which
the
brigands
will
attack
sooner
or
later
the
younger
sons
will
be
his
chief
officers
the
husbandmen
his
soldiers
all
that
is
to
be
feared
is
that
the
younger
son
may
assassinate
or
poison
the
salian
lord
his
elder
brother
in
order
to
become
in
his
turn
the
master
of
the
hovel
but
these
cases
are
rare
because
nature
has
so
combined
our
instincts
and
our
passions
that
we
have
more
horror
of
assassinating
our
elder
brother
than
we
have
of
being
envious
of
his
position
but
this
law
suitable
for
the
owners
of
dungeons
in
chilperic
time
is
detestable
when
there
is
question
of
sharing
stocks
in
a
city
to
the
shame
of
mankind
one
knows
that
the
laws
of
games
are
the
only
ones
which
everywhere
are
just
clear
inviolable
and
executed
why
is
the
indian
who
gave
us
the
rules
of
the
game
of
chess
willingly
obeyed
all
over
the
world
and
why
are
the
popes
decretals
for
example
an
object
of
horror
and
scorn
the
reason
is
that
the
inventor
of
chess
combined
everything
with
precision
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
players
and
that
the
popes
in
their
decretals
had
nothing
in
view
but
their
own
interest
the
indian
wished
to
exercise
men
minds
equally
and
give
them
pleasure
the
popes
wished
to
besot
men
minds
also
the
essence
of
the
game
of
chess
has
remained
the
same
for
five
thousand
years
it
is
common
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
the
decretals
are
known
only
at
spoletto
orvieto
loretto
where
the
shallowest
lawyer
secretly
hates
and
despises
them
but
i
delight
in
thinking
that
there
is
a
natural
law
independent
of
all
human
conventions
the
fruit
of
my
work
must
belong
to
me
i
must
honour
my
father
and
my
mother
i
have
no
right
over
my
fellow
life
and
my
fellow
has
none
over
mine
etc
but
when
i
think
that
from
chedorlaomer
to
mentzel
colonel
of
hussars
everyone
loyally
kills
and
pillages
his
fellow
with

in
his
pocket
i
am
very
afflicted
i
am
told
that
there
are
laws
among
thieves
and
also
laws
of
war
i
ask
what
are
these
laws
of
war
i
learn
that
they
mean
hanging
a
brave
officer
who
has
held
fast
in
a
bad
post
without
cannon
against
a
royal
army
that
they
mean
having
a
prisoner
hanged
if
the
enemy
has
hanged
one
of
yours
that
they
mean
putting
to
the
fire
and
the
sword
villages
which
have
not
brought
their
sustenance
on
the
appointed
day
according
to
the
orders
of
the
gracious
sovereign
of
the
district
good
say
i
that
is
the
of
the
laws
it
seems
to
me
that
most
men
have
received
from
nature
enough
common
sense
to
make
laws
but
that
everyone
is
not
just
enough
to
make
good
laws

either
i

very
much
mistaken
or
locke
the
definer
has
very
well
defined
liberty
as
power
i
am
mistaken
again
or

celebrated

magistrate
is
the
only
philosopher
who
has
really
sifted
this
idea
and
clark
answer
to
him
was
merely
that
of
a
theologian
but
of
all
that
has
been
written
in
france
on
liberty
the
following
little
dialogue
seems
to
me
the
most
clear
a
there
is
a
battery
of
guns
firing
in
your
ears
have
you
the
liberty
to
hear
them
or
not
to
hear
them
b
without
doubt
i
can
not
stop
myself
hearing
them
a
do
you
want
this
gun
to
carry
off
your
head
and
the
heads
of
your
wife
and
daughter
who
are
walking
with
you
b
what
are
you
talking
about
as
long
as
i
am
of
sound
mind
i
can
not
want
such
a
thing
it
is
impossible
a
good
you
hear
this
gun
necessarily
and
you
wish
necessarily
that
neither
you
nor
your
family
shall
die
from
a
cannon
shot
while
you
are
out
for
a
walk
you
have
not
the
power
either
of
not
hearing
or
of
wishing
to
remain
here
b
clearly
a
you
have
consequently
taken
some
thirty
steps
in
order
to
be
sheltered
from
the
gun
you
have
had
the
power
to
walk
these
few
steps
with
me
b
again
very
clearly
a
and
if
you
had
been
a
paralytic
you
could
not
have
avoided
being
exposed
to
this
battery
you
would
necessarily
have
heard
and
received
a
gun
shot
and
you
would
be
dead
necessarily
b
nothing
is
more
true
a
in
what
then
does
your
liberty
consist
unless
it
be
in
the
power
that
your
self
has
exercised
in
performing
what
your
will
required
of
absolute
necessity
b
you
embarrass
me
liberty
then
is
nothing
but
the
power
of
doing
what
i
want
to
do
a
think
about
it
and
see
if
liberty
can
be
understood
otherwise
b
in
that
case
my
hunting
dog
is
as
free
as
i
am
he
has
necessarily
the
will
to
run
when
he
sees
a
hare
and
the
power
of
running
if
he
has
not
a
pain
in
his
legs
i
have
then
nothing
above
my
dog
you
reduce
me
to
the
state
of
the
beasts
a
what
poor
sophistry
from
the
poor
sophists
who
have
taught
you
indeed
you
are
in
a
bad
way
to
be
free
like
your
dog
do
you
not
eat
sleep
propagate
like
him
even
almost
to
the
attitude
do
you
want
the
sense
of
smell
other
than
through
your
nose
why
do
you
want
to
have
liberty
otherwise
than
your
dog
has
b
but
i
have
a
soul
which
reasons
much
and
my
dog
reasons
hardly
at
all
he
has
almost
only
simple
ideas
and
i
have
a
thousand
metaphysical
ideas
a
well
you
are
a
thousand
times
freer
than
he
is
that
is
you
have
a
thousand
times
more
power
of
thinking
than
he
has
but
you
do
not
think
otherwise
than
he
does
b
what
i
am
not
free
to
wish
what
i
wish
a
what
do
you
mean
by
that
b
i
mean
what
everyone
means
does
one
say
every
day
wishes
are
free
a
a
proverb
is
not
a
reason
explain
yourself
more
clearly
b
i
mean
that
i
am
free
to
wish
as
i
please
a
with
your
permission
that
has
no
sense
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
say
i
wish
to
wish
you
wish
necessarily
as
a
result
of
the
ideas
that
have
offered
themselves
to
you
do
you
wish
to
be
married
yes
or
no
b
but
if
i
tell
you
that
i
want
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
a
you
will
be
answering
like
someone
who
says
some
believe
cardinal
mazarin
to
be
dead
others
believe
him
to
be
alive
and
as
for
me
i
believe
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
b
well
i
want
to
be
married
a
ah
that
is
an
answer
why
do
you
want
to
be
married
b
because
i
am
in
love
with
a
beautiful
sweet
young
girl
who
is
fairly
rich
and
sings
very
well
whose
parents
are
very
honest
people
and
because
i
flatter
myself
i
am
loved
by
her
and
very
welcome
to
her
family
a
that
is
a
reason
you
see
that
you
can
not
wish
without
reason
i
declare
to
you
that
you
are
free
to
marry
that
is
that
you
have
the
power
to
sign
the
contract
have
your
nuptials
and
sleep
with
your
wife
b
how
now
i
can
not
wish
without
reason
and
what
will
become
of
that
other
proverb
pro
ratione
my
will
is
my
reason
i
wish
because
i
wish
a
that
is
absurd
my
dear
fellow
there
would
be
in
you
an
effect
without
a
cause
b
what
when
i
play
at
odds
and
evens
i
have
a
reason
for
choosing
evens
rather
than
odds
a
yes
undoubtedly
b
and
what
is
that
reason
if
you
please
a
the
reason
is
that
the
idea
of
even
rather
than
the
opposite
idea
presents
itself
to
your
mind
it
would
be
comic
that
there
were
cases
where
you
wished
because
there
was
a
cause
of
wishing
and
that
there
were
cases
where
you
wished
without
any
cause
when
you
wish
to
be
married
you
evidently
feel
the
dominating
reason
you
do
not
feel
it
when
you
are
playing
at
odds
and
evens
and
yet
there
certainly
must
be
one
b
but
i
repeat
i
am
not
free
then
a
your
will
is
not
free
but
your
actions
are
you
are
free
to
act
when
you
have
the
power
to
act
b
but
all
the
books
i
have
read
on
the
liberty
of
indifference
a
what
do
you
mean
by
the
liberty
of
indifference
b
i
mean
the
liberty
of
spitting
on
the
right
or
on
the
left
of
sleeping
on
my
right
side
or
on
my
left
of
taking
a
walk
of
four
turns
or
five
a
really
the
liberty
you
would
have
there
would
be
a
comic
liberty
god
would
have
given
you
a
fine
gift
it
would
really
be
something
to
boast
of
of
what
use
to
you
would
be
a
power
which
was
exercised
only
on
such
futile
occasions
but
the
fact
is
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
suppose
the
will
to
wish
to
spit
on
the
right
not
only
is
this
will
to
wish
absurd
but
it
is
certain
that
several
trifling
circumstances
determine
you
in
these
acts
that
you
call
indifferent
you
are
no
more
free
in
these
acts
than
in
the
others
but
i
repeat
you
are
free
at
all
times
in
all
places
as
soon
as
you
do
what
you
wish
to
do
b
i
suspect
you
are
right
i
will
think
about
it
footnotes
see
a
big
library
has
this
in
it
of
good
that
it
dismays
those
who
look
at
it
two
hundred
thousand
volumes
discourage
a
man
tempted
to
print
but
unfortunately
he
at
once
says
to
himself
people
do
not
read
all
those
books
and
they
may
read
mine
he
compares
himself
to
a
drop
of
water
who
complains
of
being
lost
in
the
ocean
and
ignored
a
genius
had
pity
on
it
he
caused
it
to
be
swallowed
by
an
oyster
it
became
the
most
beautiful
pearl
in
the
orient
and
was
the
chief
ornament
in
the
throne
of
the
great
mogul
those
who
are
only
compilers
imitators
commentators
splitters
of
phrases
usurious
critics
in
short
those
on
whom
a
genius
has
no
pity
will
always
remain
drops
of
water
our
man
works
in
his
garret
therefore
in
the
hope
of
becoming
a
pearl
it
is
true
that
in
this
immense
collection
of
books
there
are
about
a
hundred
and
thousand
which
will
never
be
read
from
cover
to
cover
at
least
but
one
may
need
to
consult
some
of
them
once
in
a
lifetime
it
is
a
great
advantage
for
whoever
wishes
to
learn
to
find
at
his
hand
in
the
king
palace
the
volume
and
page
he
seeks
without
being
kept
waiting
a
moment
it
is
one
of
the
most
noble
institutions
no
expense
is
more
magnificent
and
more
useful
the
public
library
of
the
king
of
france
is
the
finest
in
the
whole
world
less
on
account
of
the
number
and
rarity
of
the
volumes
than
of
the
ease
and
courtesy
with
which
the
librarians
lend
them
to
all
scholars
this
library
is
incontestably
the
most
precious
monument
there
is
in
france
this
astounding
multitude
of
books
should
not
scare
we
have
already
remarked
that
paris
contains
about
seven
hundred
thousand
men
that
one
can
not
live
with
them
all
and
that
one
chooses
three
or
four
friends
thus
must
one
no
more
complain
of
the
multitude
of
books
than
of
the
multitude
of
citizens
a
man
who
wishes
to
learn
a
little
about
his
existence
and
who
has
no
time
to
waste
is
quite
embarrassed
he
wishes
to
read
simultaneously
hobbes
spinoza
bayle
who
wrote
against
them
leibnitz
who
disputed
with
bayle
clarke

who
passed
as
having
confounded
malebranche
stillingfleet
who
thought
he
had
vanquished
locke
cudworth
who
thinks
himself
above
them
because
he
is
understood
by
no
one
one
would
die
of
old
age
before
having
thumbed
the
hundredth
part
of
the
metaphysical
romances
one
is
very
content
to
have
the
most
ancient
books
as
one
inquires
into
the
most
ancient
medals
it
is
that
which
makes
the
honour
of
a
library
the
oldest
books
in
the
world
are
the
kings
of
the
chinese
the
shastabad
of
the
brahmins
of
which
holwell
has
brought
to
our
knowledge
admirable
passages
what
remains
of
the
ancient
zarathustra
the
fragments
of
sanchoniathon
which
eusebius
has
preserved
for
us
and
which
bears
the
characteristics
of
the
most
remote
antiquity
i
do
not
speak
of
the
pentateuch
which
is
above
all
one
could
say
of
it
we
still
have
the
prayer
of
the
real
orpheus
which
the
hierophant
recited
in
the
old
greek
mysteries
walk
in
the
path
of
justice
worship
the
sole
master
of
the
universe
he
is
one
he
is
sole
by
himself
all
beings
owe
him
their
existence
he
acts
in
them
and
by
them
he
sees
everything
and
never
has
been
seen
by
mortal
eyes
clement
of
alexandria
the
most
learned
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
or
rather
the
only
scholar
in
profane
antiquity
gives
him
almost
always
the
name
of
orpheus
of
thrace
of
orpheus
the
theologian
to
distinguish
him
from
those
who
wrote
later
under
his
name
we
have
no
longer
anything
either
of
museus
or
of
linus
a
few
passages
from
these
predecessors
of
homer
would
well
be
an
adornment
to
a
library

formed
the
library
called

palatine
the
statue
of
apollo
presided
over
it
the
emperor
embellished
it
with

best
authors

in

great
public
libraries
there
are
now
more
than
four
thousand
important
libraries
in
europe
choose
which
suits
you
and
try
not
to
be
bored
of
the
human
someone
asked
newton
one
day
why
he
walked
when
he
wanted
to
and
how
his
arm
and
his
hand
moved
at
his
will
he
answered
manfully
that
he
had
no
idea
but
at
least
his
interlocutor
said
to
him
you
who
understand
so
well
the
gravitation
of
the
planets
will
tell
me
why
they
turn
in
one
direction
rather
than
in
another
and
he
again
confessed
that
he
had
no
idea
those
who
taught
that
the
ocean
was
salt
for
fear
that
it
might
become
putrid
and
that
the
tides
were
made
to
bring
our
ships
into
port
the
abbé

somewhat
ashamed

them

no
ebb
musschenbroeck
himself
fell
into
this
inadvertence
has
anyone
ever
been
able
to
say
precisely
how
a

is
changed
on

hearth
into
burning
carbon
and
by
what

accomplished
has
one
guessed
what
gives
us
sensations
ideas
memory
we
do
not
understand
the
essence
of
matter
any
more
than
the
children
who
touch
its
surface
who
will
teach
us
by
what
mechanism
this
grain
of
wheat
that
we
throw
into
the
ground
rises
again
to
produce
a
pipe
laden
with
an
ear
of
corn

how
the

produces
an
apple
at
the

of

you

find

calumny

in
flanders
in
the
last
century
they
were
carried
to
a
point
of
indecency
which
might
revolt
eyes
unaccustomed
to
these
spectacles
this
is
how
christmas
was
celebrated
in
some
towns
first
there
appeared
a
young
man
half
naked
with
wings
on
his
back
he
recited
the
to
a
young
girl
who
answered
him
and
the
angel
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
then
a
child
enclosed
in

cock
cried
imitating
the
cock
cry
natus

a
big
ox
bellowed

it
pronounced
a

bleated
an
ass
cried
to
signify
a
long
procession
preceded
by
four
fools
with
baubles
and
rattles
closed
the
performance
there
remain
traces
of
these
popular
devotions
which
among
more
educated
peoples
would
be
taken
for
profanations
a
swiss
more
drunk
maybe
than
those
who
played
the
rôles
of
ox
and
ass
came
to
words
with
them
in
louvain
blows
were
given
the
people
wanted
to
hang
the
swiss
who
escaped
with
difficulty
the

had
a
violent
quarrel
at
the
hague
in
holland
for
having
stoutly
taken

part
against

extravagant

he
was
put
into
prison
in

for
having
said
that
priests
are
the
scourge
of
humanity
and
the
source
of
all
our
misfortunes

said

that
good
works
make

one
laughs
at
a
cock
and
an
ass
one
risks
being
hanged
this
adventure
burlesque
though
it
is
makes
it
quite
clear
that
one
can
be
reprehensible
on
one
or
two
points
in
our
hemisphere
and
be
absolutely
innocent
in
the
rest
of
the
world
there
are
so
many
sorts
of
love
that
one
does
not
know
to
whom
to
address
oneself
for
a
definition
of
it
the
name
of
love
is
given
boldly
to
a
caprice
lasting
a
few
days
a
sentiment
without
esteem
gallants
affectations
a
frigid
habit
a
romantic
fantasy
relish
followed
by
prompt
disrelish
people
give
this
name
to
a
thousand
chimeras
if
philosophers
want
to
probe
to
the
bottom
this
barely
philosophical
matter
let
them
meditate
on
the
banquet
of
plato
in
which
socrates
honourable
lover
of
alcibiades
and
agathon
converses
with
them
on
the
metaphysics
of
love
lucretius
speaks
of
it
more
as
a
natural
philosopher
virgil
follows
in
the
steps
of
lucretius
omnibus
it
is
the
stuff
of
nature
broidered
by
nature
do
you
want
an
idea
of
love
look
at
the
sparrows
in
your
garden
look
at
your
pigeons
look
at
the
bull
which
is
brought
to
the
heifer
look
at
this
proud
horse
which
two
of
your
grooms
lead
to
the
quiet
mare
awaiting
him
she
draws
aside
her
tail
to
welcome
him
see
how
her
eyes
sparkle
hark
to
the
neighing
watch
the
prancing
the
curvetting
the
ears
pricked
the
mouth
opening
with
little
convulsions
the
swelling
nostrils
the
flaring
breath
the
manes
rising
and
floating
the
impetuous
movement
with
which
he
hurls
himself
on
the
object
which
nature
has
destined
for
him
but
be
not
jealous
of
him
and
think
of
the
advantages
of
the
human
species
in
love
they
compensate
for
all
those
that
nature
has
given
to
the
animals
strength
beauty
nimbleness
speed
there
are
animals
even
who
have
no
enjoyment
in
possession
scale
fish
are
deprived
of
this
delight
the
female
throws
millions
of
eggs
on
the
mud
the
male
coming
across
them
passes
over
them
and
fertilizes
them
with
his
seed
without
troubling
about
the
female
to
whom
they
belong
most
animals
that
pair
taste
pleasure
only
by
a
single
sense
and
as
soon
as
the
appetite
is
satisfied
everything
is
extinguished
no
animal
apart
from
you
knows
what
kissing
is
the
whole
of
your
body
is
sensitive
your
lips
especially
enjoy
a
voluptuousness
that
nothing
can
tire
and
this
pleasure
belongs
to
no
species
but
yours
you
can
give
yourself
up
to
love
at
any
time
and
the
animals
have
but
a
fixed
time
if
you
reflect
on
these
superiorities
you
will
say
with
the
count
of
rochester
in
a
country
of
atheists
love
would
cause
the
deity
to
be
worshipped
as
men
have
received
the
gift
of
perfecting
all
that
nature
accords
them
they
have
perfected
love
cleanliness
the
care
of
oneself
by
rendering
the
skin
more
delicate
increase
the
pleasure
of
contact
and
attention
to
one
health
renders
the
organs
of
voluptuousness
more
sensitive
all
the
other
sentiments
that
enter
into
that
of
love
just
like
metals
which
amalgamate
with
gold
friendship
regard
come
to
help
the
faculties
of
mind
and
body
are
still
further
chains
above
all
tightens
all
these
bonds
one
applauds
oneself
for
one
choice
and
a
crowd
of
illusions
form
the
decoration
of
the
building
of
which
nature
has
laid
the
foundations
that
is
what
you
have
above
the
animals
but
if
you
taste
so
many
pleasures
unknown
to
them
how
many
sorrows
too
of
which
the
beasts
have
no
idea
what
is
frightful
for
you
is
that
over
of
the
earth
nature
has
poisoned
the
pleasures
of
love
and
the
sources
of
life
with
an
appalling
disease
to
which
man
alone
is
subject
and
which
infects
in
him
the
organs
of
generation
alone
it
is
in
no
wise
with
this
plague
as
with
so
many
other
maladies
that
are
the
result
of
our
excesses
it
was
not
debauch
that
introduced
it
into
the
world
phryne
lais
flora
messalina
and
those
like
them
were
not
attacked
by
it
it
was
born
in
some
islands
where
men
lived
in
innocence
and
thence
spread
itself
over
the
ancient
world
if
ever
one
could
accuse
nature
of
despising
her
work
of
contradicting
her
plans
of
acting
against
her
designs
it
is
in
this
detestable
scourge
which
has
soiled
the
earth
with
horror
and
filth
is
that
the
best
of
all
possible
worlds
what
if
cæsar
antony
octavius
never
had
this
disease
was
it
not
possible
for
it
not
to
cause
the
death
of
françois
no
people
say
things
were
ordered
thus
for
the
best
i
want
to
believe
it
but
it
is
sad
for
those
to
whom
rabelais
dedicated
his
book
erotic
philosophers
have
often
debated
the
question
of
whether
heloïse
could
still
really
love
abelard
when
he
was
a
monk
and
emasculate
one
of
these
qualities
did
very
great
harm
to
the
other
but
console
yourself
abelard
you
were
loved
the
root
of
the
hewn
tree
still
retains
a
remnant
of
sap
the
imagination
aids
the
heart
one
can
still
be
happy
at
table
even
though
one
eats
no
longer
is
it
love
is
it
simply
a
memory
is
it
friendship
all
that
is
composed
of
something
indescribable
it
is
an
obscure
feeling
resembling
the
fantastic
passions
retained
by
the
dead
in
the
elysian
fields
the
heroes
who
during
their
lifetime
shone
in
the
chariot
races
drove
imaginary
chariots
when
they
were
dead
heloïse
lived
with
you
on
illusions
and
supplements
she
kissed
you
sometimes
and
with
all
the
more
pleasure
that
having
taken
a
vow
at
the
paraclet
monastery
to
love
you
no
longer
her
kisses
thereby
became
more
precious
as
more
guilty
a
woman
can
barely
be
seized
with
a
passion
for
a
eunuch
but
she
can
keep
her
passion
for
her
lover
become
eunuch
provided
that
he
remains
lovable
it
is
not
the
same
ladies
for
a
lover
who
has
grown
old
in
service
the
externals
subsist
no
longer
the
wrinkles
horrify
the
white
eyebrows
shock
the
lost
teeth
disgust
the
infirmities
estrange
all
that
one
can
do
is
to
have
the
virtue
of
being
nurse
and
of
tolerating
what
one
has
loved
it
is
burying
a
dead
man
people
have
declaimed
against
luxury
for
two
thousand
years
in
verse
and
in
prose
and
people
have
always
delighted
in
it
what
has
not
been
said
of
the
early
romans
when
these
brigands
ravaged
and
pillaged
the
harvests
when
to
enlarge
their
poor
village
they
destroyed
the
poor
villages
of
the
volscians
and
the
samnites
they
were
disinterested
virtuous
men
they
had
not
yet
been
able
to
steal
either
gold
silver
or
precious
stones
because
there
were
not
any
in
the
little
towns
they
plundered
their
woods
and
their
marshes
produced
neither
pheasants
nor
partridges
and
people
praise
their
temperance
when
gradually
they
had
pillaged
everything
stolen
everything
from
the
far
end
of
the
adriatic
gulf
to
the
euphrates
and
when
they
had
enough
intelligence
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
their
plundering
when
they
cultivated
the
arts
when
they
tasted
of
all
pleasures
and
when
they
even
made
the
vanquished
taste
of
them
they
ceased
then
people
say
to
be
wise
and
honest
men
all
these
declamations
reduce
themselves
to
proving
that
a
robber
must
never
either
eat
the
dinner
he
has
taken
or
wear
the
coat
he
has
pilfered
or
adorn
himself
with
the
ring
he
has
filched
he
should
throw
all
that
people
say
in
the
river
so
as
to
live
like
an
honest
man
say
rather
that
he
should
not
have
stolen
condemn
brigands
when
they
pillage
but
do
not
treat
them
as
senseless
when
they
enjoy
honestly
when
a
large
number
of
english
sailors
enriched
themselves
at
the
taking
of
pondicherry
and
havana
were
they
wrong
to
enjoy
themselves
later
in
london
as
the
price
of
the
trouble
they
had
had
in
the
depths
of
asia
and
america
the
declaimers
want
one
to
bury
in
the
ground
the
wealth
one
has
amassed
by
the
fortune
of
arms
by
agriculture
by
commerce
and
by
industry
they
cite
lacedæmon
why
do
they
not
cite
also
the
republic
of
san
marino
what
good
did
sparto
to
greece
did
she
ever
have
demosthenes
sophocles
apelles
phidias
the
luxury
of
athens
produced
great
men
in
every
sphere
sparta
had
a
few
captains
and
in
less
number
even
than
other
towns
but
how
fine
it
is
that
as
small
a
republic
as
lacedæmon
retains
its
poverty
one
arrives
at
death
as
well
by
lacking
everything
as
by
enjoying
what
can
make
life
pleasant
the
canadian
savage
subsists
and
comes
to
old
age
like
the
english
citizen
who
has
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
guineas
but
who
will
ever
compare
the
land
of
the
iroquois
to
england
let
the
republic
of
ragusa
and
the
canton
of
zug
make
sumptuary
laws
they
are
right
the
poor
man
must
not
spend
beyond
his
powers
but
i
have
read
somewhere
learn
that
luxury
enriches
a
great
state
even
if
it
ruins
a
small
if
by
luxury
you
understand
excess
everyone
knows
that
excess
in
any
form
is
pernicious
in
abstinence
as
in
gluttony
in
economy
as
in
generosity
i
do
not
know
how
it
has
happened
that
in
my
village
where
the
land
is
ungrateful
the
taxes
heavy
the
prohibition
against
exporting
the
corn
one
has
sown
intolerable
there
is
nevertheless
barely
a
cultivator
who
has
not
a
good
cloth
coat
and
who
is
not
well
shod
and
well
fed
if
this
cultivator
toiled
in
his
fields
in
his
fine
coat
with
white
linen
his
hair
curled
and
powdered
there
certainly
would
be
the
greatest
luxury
and
the
most
impertinent
but
that
a
bourgeois
of
paris
or
london
should
appear
at
the
theatre
clad
like
a
peasant
there
would
be
the
most
vulgar
and
ridiculous
niggardliness
when
scissors
which
are
certainly
not
of
the
remotest
antiquity
were
invented
what
did
people
not
say
against
the
first
men
who
pared
their
nails
and
who
cut
part
of
the
hair
which
fell
on
their
noses
they
were
treated
without
a
doubt
as
fops
and
prodigals
who
bought
an
instrument
of
vanity
at
a
high
price
in
order
to
spoil
the
handiwork
what
an
enormous
sin
to
cut
short
the
horn
which
god
made
to
grow
at
the
end
of
our
fingers
it
was
an
outrage
against
the
deity
it
was
much
worse
when
shirts
and
socks
were
invented
one
knows
with
what
fury
the
aged
counsellors
who
had
never
worn
them
cried
out
against
the
young
magistrates
who
were
addicted
to
this
disastrous
luxury
footnotes
lacedæmon
avoided
luxury
only
by
preserving
the
community
or
equality
of
property
but
she
did
not
preserve
either
the
one
or
the
other
save
by
having
the
land
cultivated
by
an
enslaved
people
the
existence
of
the
equality
or
community
of
property
supposes
the
existence
of
an
enslaved
people
the
spartans
had
virtue
just
like
highwaymen
inquisitors
and
all
classes
of
men
whom
habit
has
familiarized
with
a
species
of
crime
to
the
point
of
committing
them
without
remorse
the
sumptuary
laws
are
by
their
nature
a
violation
of
the
right
of
property
if
in
a
little
state
there
is
not
a
great
inequality
of
fortune
there
will
be
no
luxury
if
this
inequality
exists
luxury
is
the
remedy
for
it
it
is
her
sumptuary
laws
that
have
lost
geneva
her
liberty
if
by
luxury
one
understands
everything
that
is
beyond
the
necessary
luxury
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
progress
of
the
human
species
and
to
reason
consequently
every
enemy
of
luxury
should
believe
with
rousseau
that
the
state
of
happiness
and
virtue
for
man
is
that
not
of
the
savage
but
of
the
one
feels
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
regard
as
an
evil
the
comforts
which
all
men
would
enjoy
also
does
one
not
generally
give
the
name
of
luxury
to
the
superfluities
which
only
a
small
number
of
individuals
can
enjoy
in
this
sense
luxury
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
property
without
which
no
society
can
subsist
and
of
a
great
inequality
between
fortunes
which
is
the
consequence
not
of
the
right
of
property
but
of
bad
laws
moralists
should
address
their
sermons
to
the
legislators
and
not
to
individuals
because
it
is
in
the
order
of
possible
things
that
a
virtuous
and
enlightened
man
may
have
the
power
to
make
reasonable
laws
and
it
is
not
in
human
nature
for
all
the
rich
men
of
a
country
to
renounce
through
virtue
procuring
for
themselves
for
money
the
enjoyments
of
pleasure
or
vanity
reflection
on
it
needs
twenty
years
to
lead
man
from
the
plant
state
in
which
he
is
within
his
mother
womb
and
the
pure
animal
state
which
is
the
lot
of
his
early
childhood
to
the
state
when
the
maturity
of
the
reason
begins
to
appear
it
has
needed
thirty
centuries
to
learn
a
little
about
his
structure
it
would
need
eternity
to
learn
something
about
his
soul
it
takes
an
instant
to
kill
him
in
the
iron
the
author
of
the
siècle
de
louis
xiv
is
the
first
to
speak
of
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
in
an
authenticated
history
the
reason
is
that
he
was
very
well
informed
about
the
anecdote
which
astonishes
the
present
century
which
will
astonish
posterity
and
which
is
only
too
true
he
was
deceived
about
the
date
of
the
death
of
this
singularly
unfortunate
unknown
the
date
of
his
burial
at
paul
was
march
and
not
according
to
a
certificate
reported
by
the
date
was
november
he
was
imprisoned
first
of
all
at
pignerol
before
being
so
on
margaret
islands
and
later
in
the
bastille
always
under
the
same
man
guard
who
saw
him
die
father
griffet
jesuit
has
communicated
to
the
public
the
diary
of
the
bastille
which
testifies
to
the
dates
he
had
this
diary
without
difficulty
for
he
held
the
delicate
position
of
confessor
of
prisoners
imprisoned
in
the
bastille
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
is
a
riddle
to
which
everyone
wishes
to
guess
the
answer
some
say
that
he
was
the
duc
de
beaufort
but
the
duc
de
beaufort
was
killed
by
the
turks
at
the
defence
of
candia
in
and
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
was
at
pignerol
in
besides
how
would
one
have
arrested
the
duc
de
beaufort
surrounded
by
his
army
how
would
one
have
transferred
him
to
france
without
anybody
knowing
anything
about
it
and
why
should
he
have
been
put
in
prison
and
why
this
mask
others
have
considered
the
comte
de
vermandois
natural
son
of
louis
who
died
publicly
of
the
in
with
the
army
and
was
buried
in
the
town
of
arras
later
it
was
thought
that
the
duke
of
monmouth
whose
head
king
james
ii
had
cut
off
publicly
in
london
in
was
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
him
to
be
resuscitated
and
then
for
him
to
change
the
order
of
the
times
for
him
to
put
the
year
in
place
of
for
king
james
who
never
pardoned
anyone
and
who
on
that
account
deserved
all
his
misfortunes
to
have
pardoned
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
to
have
caused
the
death
in
his
place
of
a
man
exactly
like
him
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
find
this
double
who
would
have
been
so
kind
as
to
have
his
neck
cut
off
in
public
in
order
to
save
the
duke
of
monmouth
it
would
have
been
necessary
for
the
whole
of
england
to
have
been
under
a
misapprehension
for
james
then
to
have
sent
his
earnest
entreaties
to
louis
xiv
to
be
so
good
as
to
serve
as
his
constable
and
gaoler
then
louis
xiv
having
done
king
james
this
little
favour
would
not
have
failed
to
have
the
same
consideration
for
king
william
and
for
queen
anne
with
whom
he
was
at
war
and
he
would
carefully
have
preserved
in
these
two
monarchs
consideration
his
dignity
of
gaoler
with
which
king
james
had
honoured
him
all
these
illusions
being
dissipated
it
remains
to
be
learned
who
was
this
prisoner
who
was
always
masked
the
age
at
which
he
died
and
under
what
name
he
was
buried
it
is
clear
that
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
pass
into
the
courtyard
of
the
bastille
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
speak
to
his
doctor
unless
covered
by
a
mask
it
was
for
fear
that
in
his
features
might
be
recognized
some
too
striking
resemblance
he
might
show
his
tongue
and
never
his
face
as
regards
his
age
he
himself
said
to
the
bastille
apothecary
a
few
days
before
his
death
that
he
thought
he
was
about
sixty
and
master
marsolan
surgeon
to
the
maréchal
de
richelieu
and
later
to
the
duc
regent
of
this
apothecary
has
repeated
it
to
me
more
than
once
finally
why
give
him
an
italian
name
he
was
always
called
marchiali
he
who
writes
this
article
knows
more
about
it
maybe
than
father
griffet
and
will
not
say
more
publishers
note
it
is
surprising
to
see
so
many
scholars
and
so
many
intelligent
and
sagacious
writers
torment
themselves
with
guessing
who
can
have
been
the
famous
man
in
the
iron
mask
without
the
simplest
most
natural
most
probable
idea
ever
presenting
itself
to
them
once
the
fact
as
de
voltaire
reports
it
is
admitted
with
its
circumstances
the
existence
of
a
prisoner
of
so
singular
a
species
put
in
the
rank
of
the
best
authenticated
historical
truths
it
seems
that
not
only
is
nothing
easier
than
to
imagine
who
this
prisoner
was
but
that
it
is
even
difficult
for
there
to
be
two
opinions
on
the
subject
the
author
of
this
article
would
have
communicated
his
opinion
earlier
if
he
had
not
believed
that
this
idea
must
already
have
come
to
many
others
and
if
he
were
not
persuaded
that
it
was
not
worth
while
giving
as
a
discovery
what
according
to
him
jumps
to
the
eyes
of
all
who
read
this
anecdote
however
as
for
some
time
past
this
event
has
divided
men
minds
and
as
quite
recently
the
public
has
again
been
given
a
letter
in
which
it
is
claimed
as
proved
that
this
celebrated
prisoner
was
a
secretary
of
the
duke
of
mantua
which
can
not
be
reconciled
with
the
great
marks
of
respect
shown
by
de
to
his
prisoner
the
author
has
thought
it
his
duty
to
tell
at
last
what
has
been
his
opinion
for
many
years
maybe
this
conjecture
will
put
an
end
to
all
other
researches
unless
the
secret
be
revealed
by
those
who
can
be
its
guardians
in
such
a
way
as
to
remove
all
doubts
he
will
not
amuse
himself
with
refuting
those
who
have
imagined
that
this
prisoner
could
be
the
comte
de
vermandois
the
duc
de
beaufort
or
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
scholarly
and
very
wise
author
of
this
last
opinion
has
well
refuted
the
others
but
he
had
based
his
own
opinion
essentially
merely
on
the
impossibility
of
finding
in
europe
some
other
prince
whose
detention
it
would
have
been
of
the
very
highest
importance
should
not
be
known
de
is
right
if
he
means
to
speak
only
of
princes
whose
existence
was
known
but
why
has
nobody
yet
thought
of
supposing
that
the
iron
mask
might
have
been
an
unknown
prince
brought
up
in
secret
and
whose
existence
it
was
important
should
remain
unknown
the
duke
of
monmouth
was
not
for
france
a
prince
of
such
great
importance
and
one
does
not
see
even
what
could
have
engaged
this
power
at
least
after
the
death
of
this
duke
and
of
james
to
make
so
great
a
secret
of
his
detention
if
indeed
he
was
the
iron
mask
it
is
hardly
probable
either
that
de
louvois
and
de
would
have
shown
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
profound
respect
which
de
voltaire
assures
they
showed
the
iron
mask
the
author
conjectures
from
the
way
that
de
voltaire
has
told
the
facts
that
this
celebrated
historian
is
as
persuaded
as
he
is
of
the
suspicion
which
he
is
going
he
says
to
bring
to
light
but
that
de
voltaire
as
a
frenchman
did
not
wish
he
adds
to
publish
particularly
as
he
had
said
enough
for
the
answer
to
the
riddle
not
to
be
difficult
to
guess
here
it
is
he
continues
as
i
see
it
the
iron
mask
was
undoubtedly
a
brother
and
an
elder
brother
of
louis
whose
mother
had
that
taste
for
fine
linen
on
which
de
voltaire
lays
stress
it
was
in
reading
the
memoirs
of
that
time
which
report
this
anecdote
about
the
queen
that
recalling
this
same
taste
in
the
iron
mask
i
doubted
no
longer
that
he
was
her
son
a
fact
of
which
all
the
other
circumstances
had
persuaded
me
already
it
is
known
that
louis
xiii
had
not
lived
with
the
queen
for
a
long
time
that
the
birth
of
louis
xiv
was
due
only
to
a
happy
chance
skilfully
induced
a
chance
which
absolutely
obliged
the
king
to
sleep
in
the
same
bed
with
the
queen
this
is
how
i
think
the
thing
came
to
pass
the
queen
may
have
thought
that
it
was
her
fault
that
no
heir
was
born
to
louis
xiii
the
birth
of
the
iron
mask
will
have
undeceived
her
the
cardinal
to
whom
she
will
have
confided
the
fact
will
have
known
for
more
than
one
reason
how
to
turn
the
secret
to
account
he
will
have
thought
of
making
use
of
this
event
for
his
own
benefit
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
state
persuaded
by
this
example
that
the
queen
could
give
the
king
children
the
plan
which
produced
the
chance
of
one
bed
for
the
king
and
the
queen
was
arranged
in
consequence
but
the
queen
and
the
cardinal
equally
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
hiding
from
louis
xiii
the
iron
mask
existence
will
have
had
him
brought
up
in
secret
this
secret
will
have
been
a
secret
for
louis
xiv
until
cardinal
mazarin
death
but
this
monarch
learning
then
that
he
had
a
brother
and
an
elder
brother
whom
his
mother
could
not
disacknowledge
who
further
bore
maybe
the
marked
features
which
betrayed
his
origin
reflecting
that
this
child
born
during
marriage
could
not
without
great
inconvenience
and
a
horrible
scandal
be
declared
illegitimate
after
louis
xiii
death
louis
xiv
will
have
judged
that
he
could
not
use
a
wiser
or
juster
means
than
the
one
he
employed
in
order
to
assure
his
own
tranquillity
and
the
peace
of
the
state
means
which
relieved
him
of
committing
a
cruelty
which
policy
would
have
represented
as
necessary
to
a
monarch
less
conscientious
and
less
magnanimous
than
louis
xiv
it
seems
to
me
our
author
continues
that
the
more
one
knows
of
the
history
of
those
times
the
more
one
must
be
struck
by
these
assembled
circumstances
which
are
in
favour
of
such
a
supposition
footnotes
voltaire
this
note
given
as
a
publisher
note
in
the
edition
passes
among
many
men
of
letters
as
being
by
voltaire
himself
he
knew
of
this
edition
and
he
never
contradicted
the
opinion
there
advanced
on
the
subject
of
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
he
was
the
first
to
speak
of
this
man
he
always
combated
all
the
conjectures
made
about
the
mask
he
always
spoke
as
though
better
informed
than
others
on
the
subject
and
as
though
unwilling
to
tell
all
he
knew
there
is
a
letter
in
circulation
from

written
to
the
duke
afterward
maréchal

where
she
boasts
of
having
learned
from

her
father
under
strange
conditions
who
the
man
in
the
iron

was
this
man
she
says
was
a
twin
brother
of
louis
born
a
few
hours
after
him
either
this
letter
which
it
was
so
useless
so
indecent
so
dangerous
to
read
is
a
supposititious
letter
or
the
regent
in
giving
his
daughter
the
reward
she
had
so
nobly
acquired
thought
to
weaken
the
danger
there
was
in
revealing
a

secret

altering
the

so
as
to
make
of
this
prince
a
younger
son
without
right

but
louis
who
had
a
brother
louis
whose
soul
was
magnanimous
louis
who
prided
himself
even
on
a
scrupulous
probity
whom
history
has
reproached
with
no
crime
who
indeed
committed
no
crime
apart
from
letting
himself
be
too
swayed
by
the
counsels
of
louvois
and
the
jesuits
louis
xiv
would
never
have
detained
one
of
his
brothers
in
perpetual
prison
in
order
to
forestall
the
evils
announced
by
an
astrologer
in
whom
he
did
not
believe
he
needed
more
important
motives
eldest
son
of
louis
acknowledged
by
this
prince
the
throne
belonged
to
him
but
a
son
born
of
anne
of
austria
unknown
to
her
husband
had
no
rights
and
could
nevertheless
try
to
make
himself
acknowledged
rend
france

a
long
civil

win
maybe
over

son
by
alleging
the
right

and
substitute

for
the
old
race
of
the
bourbons
these
motives
if
they
did
not
entirely
justify
louis
xiv
rigour
serve
at
least
to
excuse
him
and
the
prisoner
too
of
his
fate
could
be
grateful
to
him
for
not
having
listened
to
more
rigorous
counsels
counsels
which
politics
have
often
employed
against
those
who
had
pretensions
to
thrones
occupied
by
their
competitors
from
his
youth
voltaire
was
connected
with
the
duc
de
richelieu
who
was
not
discreet
if
mlle
de
valois

is
authentic
he
knew
of
it
but
possessed
of
a
just
mind
he
felt
the
error
and
sought
other
information
he
was
in
a
position
to
obtain
it
he
rectified
the
truth
altered
in
the

he
rectified

other
errors

her
gentler

the

on
this
phenomenon
a
great
number
of
good
volumes
have
been
written
but
i
give
the
preference
to
an
indian
fable
because
it
is
short
and
because
the
fables
have
said
everything
adimo
the
father
of
all
the
indians
had
two
sons
and
two
daughters
by
his
wife
procriti
the
elder
son
was
a
giant
the
younger
was
a
little
hunchback
the
two
daughters
were
pretty
as
soon
as
the
giant
was
conscious
of
his
strength
he
lay
with
his
two
sisters
and
made
the
little
hunchback
serve
him
of
his
two
sisters
one
was
his
cook
the
other
his
gardener
when
the
giant
wanted
to
sleep
he
started
by
chaining
his
little
hunchback
brother
to
a
tree
and
when
the
brother
escaped
he
caught
him
in
four
strides
and
gave
him
twenty
strokes
with
a
length
of
ox
sinew
the
hunchback
became
submissive
and
the
best
subject
in
the
world
the
giant
satisfied
to
see
him
fulfilling
his
duties
as
subject
permitted
him
to
lie
with
one
of
his
sisters
for
whom
he
himself
had
taken
a
distaste
the
children
who
came
of
this
marriage
were
not
entirely
hunchbacked
but
they
had
sufficiently
misshapen
forms
they
were
reared
in
fear
of
god
and
the
giant
they
received
an
excellent
education
they
were
taught
that
their
great
uncle
was
giant
by
divine
right
that
he
could
do
with
his
family
as
pleased
him
that
if
he
had
a
pretty
niece
or
she
was
for
him
alone
without
a
doubt
and
that
no
one
could
lie
with
her
until
he
wanted
her
no
longer
the
giant
having
died
his
son
who
was
not
by
a
long
way
as
strong
and
as
big
as
he
thought
nevertheless
that
he
like
his
father
was
giant
by
divine
right
he
claimed
to
make
all
the
men
work
for
him
and
to
lie
with
all
the
women
the
family
leagued
itself
against
him
he
was
beaten
to
death
and
the
others
turned
themselves
into
a
republic
the
siamese
on
the
contrary
maintain
that
the
family
had
started
by
being
republican
and
that
the
giant
did
not
come
until
after
a
great
number
of
years
and
dissensions
but
all
the
authors
of
benares
and
siam
agree
that
mankind
lived
an
infinity
of
centuries
before
having
the
intelligence
to
make
laws
and
they
prove
it
by
an
unanswerable
reason
which
is
that
even
when
everyone
plumes
himself
on
his
intelligence
no
way
has
been
found
of
making
a
score
of
passably
good
laws
it
is
indeed
still
an
insoluble
question
in
india
whether
republics
were
established
before
or
after
monarchies
whether
confusion
appeared
more
horrible
to
mankind
than
despotism
i
do
not
know
what
happened
in
order
of
time
but
in
that
of
nature
it
must
be
agreed
that
all
men
being
born
equal
violence
and
adroitness
made
the
first
masters
the
laws
made
the
last
of
in
our
barbarous
times
when
the
franks
the
germans
the
bretons
the
lombards
the
spanish
muzarabs
knew
not
how
either
to
read
or
write
there
were
instituted
schools
universities
composed
almost
entirely
of
ecclesiastics
who
knowing
nothing
but
their
own
jargon
taught
this
jargon
to
those
who
wished
to
learn
it
the
academies
came
only
a
long
time
afterwards
they
despised
the
foolishness
of
the
schools
but
did
not
always
dare
to
rise
against
them
because
there
are
foolishnesses
that
are
respected
provided
that
they
concern
respectable
things
the
men
of
letters
who
have
rendered
the
greatest
services
to
the
small
number
of
thinking
beings
spread
over
the
world
are
the
isolated
writers
the
true
scholars
shut
in
their
studies
who
have
neither
argued
on
the
benches
of
the
universities
nor
told
in
the
academies
and
almost
all
of
them
have
been
persecuted
our
wretched
species
is
so
made
that
those
who
walk
on
the
path
always
throw
stones
at
those
who
are
showing
a
new
road
montesquieu

that
the
scythians

so
that
they
might
be
less
distracted
while
they
were
churning
their

that
is
just
how
the
inquisition
functions
and
in
the
land
where
this
monster
reigns
almost
everybody
is
blind
in
england
people
have
had
two
eyes
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
the
french
are
starting
to
open
one
eye
but
sometimes
there
are
men
in
power
who
do
not
want
the
people
to
have
even
this
one
eye
open
these
poor
persons
in

are
like

in

a

of

for
having

soon
the

is
so
insolent
as
to
say
that

therefore
i
denounce
you
as
impious
the
greatest
misfortune
of
a
man
of
letters
is
not
perhaps
being
the
object
of
his
confrères
jealousy
the
victim
of
the
cabal
the
despised
of
the
men
of
power
but
of
being
judged
by
fools
fools
go
far
sometimes
particularly
when
bigotry
is
added
to
ineptitude
and
to
ineptitude
the
spirit
of
vengeance
the
further
great
misfortune
of
a
man
of
letters
is
that
ordinarily
he
is
unattached
a
bourgeois
buys
himself
a
small
position
and
there
he
is
backed
by
his
colleagues
if
he
suffers
an
injustice
he
finds
defenders
at
once
the
man
of
letters
is
unsuccoured
he
resembles
a
if
he
rises
a
little
the
birds
devour
him
if
he
dives
the
fish
eat
him
every
public
man
pays
tribute
to
malignity
but
he
is
paid
in
honours
and
gold
is
it
not
very
natural
that
all
the
metamorphoses
with
which
the
world
is
covered
should
have
made
people
imagine
in
the
orient
where
everything
has
been
imagined
that
our
souls
passed
from
one
body
to
another
an
almost
imperceptible
speck
becomes
a
worm
this
worm
becomes
a
butterfly
an
acorn
transforms
itself
into
an
oak
an
egg
into
a
bird
water
becomes
cloud
and
thunder
wood
is
changed
into
fire
and
ash
everything
in
nature
appears
in
fine
metamorphosed
soon
people
attributed
to
souls
which
were
regarded
as
light
figures
what
they
saw
in
more
gross
bodies
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
is
perhaps
the
most
ancient
dogma
of
the
known
universe
and
it
still
reigns
in
a
large
part
of
india
and
china
on
the
reproach
of
plagiarism
some
people
have
accused
milton
of
having
taken
his
poem
from
the
tragedy
of
the
banishment
of
adam
by
grotius
and
from
the
sarcotis
of
the
jesuit
masenius
printed
at
cologne
in
and
in
long
before
milton
gave
his
paradise
lost
as
regards
grotius
it
was
well
enough
known
in
england
that
milton
had
carried
into
his
epic
english
poem
a
few
latin
verses
from
the
tragedy
of
adam
it
is
in
no
wise
to
be
a
plagiarist
to
enrich
one
language
with
the
beauties
of
a
foreign
language
no
one
accused
euripides
of
plagiarism
for
having
imitated
in
one
of
the
choruses
of
iphigenia
the
second
book
of
the
iliad
on
the
contrary
people
were
very
grateful
to
him
for
this
imitation
which
they
regarded
as
a
homage
rendered
to
homer
on
the
athenian
stage
virgil
never
suffered
a
reproach
for
having
happily
imitated
in
the
æneid
a
hundred
verses
by
the
first
of
greek
poets
against
milton
the
accusation
was
pushed
a
little
further
a
scot
will
lauder
by
name
very
attached
to
the
memory
of
charles
whom
milton
had
insulted
with
the
most
uncouth
animosity
thought
himself
entitled
to
dishonour
the
memory
of
this
monarch
accuser
it
was
claimed
that
milton
was
guilty
of
an
infamous
imposture
in
robbing
charles
of
the
sad
glory
of
being
the
author
of
the
eikon
basilika
a
book
long
dear
to
the
royalists
and
which
charles
it
was
said
had
composed
in
his
prison
to
serve
as
consolation
for
his
deplorable
adversity
lauder
therefore
about
the
year
of
wanted
to
begin
by
proving
that
milton
was
only
a
plagiarist
before
proving
that
he
had
acted
as
a
forger
against
the
memory
of
the
most
unfortunate
of
kings
he
procured
some
editions
of
the
poem
of
the
sarcotis
it
seemed
evident
that
milton
had
imitated
some
passages
of
it
as
he
had
imitated
grotius
and
tasso
but
lauder
did
not
rest
content
there
he
unearthed
a
bad
translation
in
latin
verse
of
the
paradise
lost
of
the
english
poet
and
joining
several
verses
of
this
translation
to
those
by
masenius
he
thought
thereby
to
render
the
accusation
more
grave
and
milton
shame
more
complete
it
was
in
that
that
he
was
badly
deceived
his
fraud
was
discovered
he
wanted
to
make
milton
pass
for
a
forger
and
he
was
himself
convicted
of
forging
no
one
examined
masenius
poem
of
which
at
that
time
there
were
only
a
few
copies
in
europe
all
england
convinced
of
the
scot
poor
trick
asked
no
more
about
it
the
accuser
confounded
was
obliged
to
disavow
his
manoeuvre
and
ask
pardon
for
it
since
then
a
new
edition
of
masenius
was
printed
in
the
literary
public
was
surprised
at
the
large
number
of
very
beautiful
verses
with
which
the
sarcotis
was
sprinkled
it
is
in
truth
nothing
but
a
long
declamation
of
the
schools
on
the
fall
of
man
but
the
exordium
the
invocation
the
description
of
the
garden
of
eden
the
portrait
of
eve
that
of
the
devil
are
precisely
the
same
as
in
milton
further
it
is
the
same
subject
the
same
plot
the
same
catastrophe
if
the
devil
wishes
in
milton
to
be
revenged
on
man
for
the
harm
which
god
has
done
him
he
has
precisely
the
same
plan
in
the
work
of
the
jesuit
masenius
and
he
manifests
it
in
verses
worthy
maybe
of
the
century
of
augustus
sarcotis
one
finds
in
both
masenius
and
milton
little
episodes
trifling
digressions
which
are
absolutely
alike
both
speak
of
xerxes
who
covered
the
sea
with
his
ships
both
speak
in
the
same
tone
of
the
tower
of
babel
both
give
the
same
description
of
luxury
of
pride
of
avarice
of
gluttony
what
most
persuaded
the
generality
of
readers
of
milton
plagiarism
was
the
perfect
resemblance
of
the
beginning
of
the
two
poems
many
foreigners
after
reading
the
exordium
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
rest
of
milton
poem
was
taken
from
masenius
it
is
a
very
great
error
and
easy
to
recognize
i
do
not
think
that
the
english
poet
imitated
in
all
more
than
two
hundred
of
the
jesuit
of
cologne
verses
and
i
dare
say
that
he
imitated
only
what
was
worthy
of
being
imitated
these
two
hundred
verses
are
very
beautiful
so
are
milton
and
the
total
of
poem
despite
these
two
hundred
beautiful
verses
is
not
worth
anything
at
all
molière
took
two
whole
scenes
from
the
ridiculous
comedy
of
the
pédant
joué
by
cyrano
de
bergerac
these
two
scenes
are
good
he
said
as
he
was
jesting
with
his
friends
they
belong
to
me
by
right
i
recover
my
property
after
that
anyone
who
treated
the
author
of
tartufe
and
le
misanthrope
as
a
plagiarist
would
have
been
very
badly
received
it
is
certain
that
generally
milton
in
his
paradise
has
in
imitating
flown
on
his
own
wings
and
it
must
be
agreed
that
if
he
borrowed
so
many
traits
from
grotius
and
from
the
jesuit
of
cologne
they
are
blended
in
the
crowd
of
original
things
which
are
his
in
england
he
is
always
regarded
as
a
very
great
poet
it
is
true
that
he
should
have
avowed
having
translated
two
hundred
of
a
jesuit
verses
but
in
his
time
at
the
court
of
charles
people
did
not
worry
themselves
with
either
the
jesuits
or
milton
or
paradise
lost
or
paradise
regained
all
those
things
were
either
scoffed
at
or
unknown
i
tell
you
again
ignorant
imbeciles
whom
other
ignoramuses
have
made
believe
that
the
mohammedan
religion
is
voluptuous
and
sensual
there
is
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
you
have
been
deceived
on
this
point
as
on
so
many
others
canons
monks
vicars
even
if
a
law
were
imposed
on
you
not
to
eat
or
drink
from
four
in
the
morning
till
ten
at
night
during
the
month
of
july
when
lent
came
at
this
period
if
you
were
forbidden
to
play
at
any
game
of
chance
under
pain
of
damnation
if
wine
were
forbidden
you
under
the
same
pain
if
you
had
to
make
a
pilgrimage
into
the
burning
desert
if
it
were
enjoined
on
you
to
give
at
least
two
and
a
half
per
cent
of
your
income
to
the
poor
if
accustomed
to
enjoy
possession
of
eighteen
women
the
number
were
cut
down
suddenly
by
fourteen
honestly
would
you
dare
call
that
religion
sensual
the
latin
christians
have
so
many
advantages
over
the
mussulmans
i
do
not
say
in
the
matter
of
war
but
in
the
matter
of
doctrines
the
greek
christians
have
so
beaten
them
latterly
from
to
that
it
is
not
worth
the
trouble
to
indulge
in
unjust
reproaches
against
islam
try
to
retake
from
the
mohammedans
all
that
they
usurped
but
it
is
easier
to
calumniate
them
i
hate
calumny
so
much
that
i
do
not
want
even
to
impute
foolishness
to
the
turks
although
i
detest
them
as
tyrants
over
women
and
enemies
of
the
arts
i
do
not
know
why
the
historian
of
the
lower
empire
maintains
that
mohammed
speaks
in
his
koran
of
his
journey
into
the
sky
mohammed
does
not
say
a
word
about
it
we
have
proved
it
one
must
combat
ceaselessly
when
one
has
destroyed
an
error
there
is
always
someone
who
resuscitates
it
it
is
a
very
old
very
universal
fable
that
tells
of
the
mountain
which
having
frightened
all
the
countryside
by
its
outcry
that
it
was
in
labour
was
hissed
by
all
present
when
it
brought
into
the
world
a
mere
mouse
the
people
in
the
pit
were
not
philosophers
those
who
hissed
should
have
admired
it
was
as
fine
for
the
mountain
to
give
birth
to
a
mouse
as
for
the
mouse
to
give
birth
to
a
mountain
a
rock
which
produces
a
rat
is
a
very
prodigious
thing
and
never
has
the
world
seen
anything
approaching
this
miracle
all
the
globes
of
the
universe
could
not
call
a
fly
into
existence
where
the
vulgar
laugh
the
philosopher
admires
and
he
laughs
where
the
vulgar
open
their
big
stupid
eyes
in
astonishment
why
should
one
lock
up
a
man
or
a
woman
who
walked
stark
naked
in
the
street
and
why
is
no
one
shocked
by
absolutely
nude
statues
by
pictures
of
the
madonna
and
of
jesus
that
may
be
seen
in
some
churches
it
is
probably
that
the
human
species
lived
long
without
being
clothed
people
unacquainted
with
clothing
have
been
found
in
more
than
one
island
and
in
the
american
continent
the
most
civilized
hide
the
organs
of
generation
with
leaves
woven
rushes
feathers
whence
comes
this
form
of
modesty
is
it
the
instinct
for
lighting
desires
by
hiding
what
it
gives
pleasure
to
discover
is
it
really
true
that
among
slightly
more
civilized
nations
such
as
the
jews
and
there
have
been
entire
sects
who
would
not
worship
god
save
by
stripping
themselves
of
all
their
clothes
such
were
it
is
said
the
adamites
and
the
abelians
they
gathered
quite
naked
to
sing
the
praises
of
god
epiphanius
and
augustine
say
so
it
is
true
that
they
were
not
contemporary
and
that
they
were
very
far
from
these
people
country
but
at
all
events
this
madness
is
possible
it
is
not
even
more
extraordinary
more
mad
than
a
hundred
other
madnesses
which
have
been
round
the
world
one
after
the
other
we
have
said
elsewhere
that
even
the
mohammedans
still
have
saints
who
are
madmen
and
who
go
naked
like
monkeys
it
is
very
possible
that
some
fanatics
thought
it
was
better
to
present
themselves
to
the
deity
in
the
state
in
which
he
formed
them
than
in
the
disguise
invented
by
man
it
is
possible
that
they
showed
everything
out
of
piety
there
are
so
few
persons
of
both
sexes
that
nakedness
might
have
inspired
chastity
or
rather
disgust
instead
of
increasing
desire
it
is
said
particularly
that
the
abelians
renounced
marriage
if
there
were
any
fine
lads
and
pretty
lasses
among
them
they
were
at
least
comparable
to
adhelme
and
to
blessed
robert
who
slept
with
the
prettiest
persons
that
their
continence
might
triumph
all
the
more
but
i
avow
that
it
would
have
been
very
comic
to
see
a
hundred
helens
and
parises
singing
anthems
giving
each
other
the
kiss
of
peace
and
making
agapæ
all
of
which
shows
that
there
is
no
singularity
no
extravagance
no
superstition
which
has
not
passed
through
the
heads
of
mankind
happy
the
day
when
these
superstitions
do
not
trouble
society
and
make
of
it
a
scene
of
disorder
hatred
and
fury
it
is
better
without
doubt
to
pray
god
stark
naked
than
to
stain
his
altars
and
the
public
places
with
human
blood
b
what
is
natural
law
a
the
instinct
which
makes
us
feel
justice
b
what
do
you
call
just
and
unjust
a
what
appears
such
to
the
entire
universe
b
the
universe
is
composed
of
many
heads
it
is
said
that
in
lacedæmon
were

committed
at

when
everything
was

what
you
call
theft
was
the
punishment
for
avarice
b
it
was
forbidden
to
marry
one

it
was
allowed
among
the
egyptians
the

even
among
the
jews
to
marry
sister
on

side
it
is

with
regret
that
i
cite
that
wretched
little
jewish
people
who
should
assuredly
not
serve
as
a
rule
for
anyone

who
putting

was
never
anything

have
you
forgotten
that
one
of

has
said
that
the
first
man
who
dared
enclose
and
cultivate
a
piece
of
land
was
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
that
he
should
have
been
exterminated
and
that
the
fruits
of
the
earth
are
for
all
and
that
the
land
belongs
to
none
have
we
not
already
examined
together
this
lovely
proposition
which
is
so
useful
to
society
discourse
on

who
is
this
he
is
certainly
not
either
john
the
baptist
nor
john
the
evangelist
nor
james
the
greater
nor
james
the
less
it
must
be
some
hunnish
wit
who
wrote
that
abominable
impertinence
or
some
poor
joker
who
wanted
to
laugh
at
what
the
entire
world
regards
as
most
serious
for
instead
of
going
to
spoil
the
land
of
a
wise
and
industrious
neighbour
he
had
only
to
imitate
him
and
every
father
of
a
family
having
followed
this
example
behold
soon
a
very
pretty
village
formed
the
author
of
this
passage
seems
to
me
a
very
unsociable
animal
b
you
think
then
that
by
outraging
and
robbing
the
good
man
who
has
surrounded
his
garden
and
with
a
live
hedge
he
has
been
wanting
in
respect
towards
the
duties
of
natural
law
a
yes
yes
once
again
there
is
a
natural
law
and
it
does
not
consist
either
in
doing
harm
to
others
or
in
rejoicing
thereat
b
i
imagine
that
man
likes
and
does
harm
only
for
his
own
advantage
but
so
many
people
are
led
to
look
for
their
own
interest
in
the
misfortune
of
others
vengeance
is
so
violent
a
passion
there
are
such
disastrous
examples
of
it
ambition
still
more
fatal
has
inundated
the
world
with
so
much
blood
that
when
i
retrace
for
myself
the
horrible
picture
i
am
tempted
to
avow
that
man
is
a
very
devil
in
vain
have
i
in
my
heart
the
notion
of
justice
and
injustice
an
attila
courted
by
leo
a
phocas
flattered
by
gregory
with
the
most
cowardly
baseness
an
alexander
vi
sullied
with
so
many
incests
so
many
murders
so
many
poisonings
with
whom
the
weak
louis
who
is
called
the
good
makes
the
most
infamous
and
intimate
alliance
a
cromwell
whose
protection
cardinal
mazarin
seeks
and
for
whom
he
drives
out
of
france
the
heirs
of
charles
louis
xiv
first
cousins
etc
a
hundred
like
examples
set
my
ideas
in
disorder
and
i
know
no
longer
where
i
am
a
well
do
storms
stop
our
enjoyment
of
beautiful
sun
did
the
earthquake
which
destroyed
half
the
city
of
lisbon
stop
your
making
the
voyage
to
madrid
very
comfortably
if
attila
was
a
brigand
and
cardinal
mazarin
a
rogue
are
there
not
princes
and
ministers
who
are
honest
people
has
it
not
been
remarked
that
in
the
war
of
louis
xiv
council
was
composed
of
the
most
virtuous
men
the
duc
de
beauvilliers
the
marquis
de
torci
the
maréchal
de
villars
chamillart
lastly
who
passed
for
being
incapable
but
never
for
dishonest
does
not
the
idea
of
justice
subsist
always
it
is
upon
that
idea
that
all
laws
are
founded
the
greeks
called
them
daughters
of
heaven
which
only
means
daughters
of
nature
have
you
no
laws
in
your
country
b
yes
some
good
some
bad
a
where
if
it
was
not
in
the
notions
of
natural
law
did
you
get
the
idea
that
every
man
has
within
himself
when
his
mind
is
properly
made
you
must
have
obtained
it
there
or
nowhere
b
you
are
right
there
is
a
natural
law
but
it
is
still
more
natural
to
many
people
to
forget
it
a
it
is
natural
also
to
be
lame
deformed
unhealthy
but
one
prefers
people
who
are
well
made
and
healthy
b
why
are
there
so
many
and
deformed
minds
a
peace
but

dialogue
between
the
philosopher
and
nature
the
philosopher
who
are
you
nature
i
live
in
you
for
fifty
years
have
i
been
seeking
you
and
i
have
not
found
you
yet
nature
the
ancient
egyptians
who
lived
it
is
said
some
twelve
hundred
years
made
me
the
same
reproach
they
called
me
isis
they
put
a
great
veil
on
my
head
and
they
said
that
nobody
could
lift
it
the
philosopher
that
is
what
makes
me
address
myself
to
you
i
have
been
able
to
measure
some
of
your
globes
know
their
paths
assign
the
laws
of
motion
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
learn
who
you
are
are
you
always
active
are
you
always
passive
did
your
elements
arrange
themselves
as
water
deposits
itself
on
sand
oil
on
water
air
on
oil
have
you
a
mind
which
directs
all
your
operations
as
councils
are
inspired
as
soon
as
they
are
assembled
although
their
members
are
sometimes
ignoramuses
i
pray
you
tell
me
the
answer
to
your
riddle
nature
i
am
the
great
everything
i
know
no
more
about
it
i
am
not
a
mathematician
and
everything
is
arranged
in
my
world
according
to
mathematical
laws
guess
if
you
can
how
it
is
all
done
the
philosopher
certainly
since
your
great
everything
does
not
know
mathematics
and
since
all
your
laws
are
most
profoundly
geometrical
there
must
be
an
eternal
geometer
who
directs
you
a
supreme
intelligence
who
presides
over
your
operations
nature
you
are
right
i
am
water
earth
fire
atmosphere
metal
mineral
stone
vegetable
animal
i
feel
indeed
that
there
is
in
me
an
intelligence
you
have
an
intelligence
you
do
not
see
it
i
do
not
see
mine
either
i
feel
this
invisible
power
i
can
not
know
it
why
should
you
who
are
but
a
small
part
of
me
want
to
know
what
i
do
not
know
the
philosopher
we
are
curious
i
want
to
know
how
being
so
crude
in
your
mountains
in
your
deserts
in
your
seas
you
appear
nevertheless
so
industrious
in
your
animals
in
your
vegetables
nature
my
poor
child
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
that
i
have
been
given
a
name
which
does
not
suit
me
my
name
is
nature
and
i
am
all
art
the
philosopher
that
word
upsets
all
my
ideas
what
nature
is
only
art
nature
yes
without
any
doubt
do
you
not
know
that
there
is
an
infinite
art
in
those
seas
and
those
mountains
that
you
find
so
crude
do
you
not
know
that
all
those
waters
gravitate
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
mount
only
by
immutable
laws
that
those
mountains
which
crown
the
earth
are
the
immense
reservoirs
of
the
eternal
snows
which
produce
unceasingly
those
fountains
lakes
and
rivers
without
which
my
animal
species
and
my
vegetable
species
would
perish
and
as
for
what
are
called
my
animal
kingdom
my
vegetable
kingdom
and
my
mineral
kingdom
you
see
here
only
three
learn
that
i
have
millions
of
kingdoms
but
if
you
consider
only
the
formation
of
an
insect
of
an
ear
of
corn
of
gold
of
copper
everything
will
appear
as
marvels
of
art
the
philosopher
it
is
true
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
see
that
you
are
only
the
art
of
i
know
not
what
most
potent
and
industrious
great
being
who
hides
himself
and
who
makes
you
appear
all
reasoners
since
thales
and
probably
long
before
him
have
played
at
blind
man
buff
with
you
they
have
said
i
have
you
and
they
had
nothing
we
all
resemble
ixion
he
thought
he
was
kissing
juno
and
all
that
he
possessed
was
a
cloud
nature
since
i
am
all
that
is
how
can
a
being
such
as
you
so
small
a
part
of
myself
seize
me
be
content
atoms
my
children
with
seeing
a
few
atoms
that
surround
you
with
drinking
a
few
drops
of
my
milk
with
vegetating
for
a
few
moments
on
my
breast
and
with
dying
without
having
known
your
mother
and
your
nurse
the
philosopher
my
dear
mother
tell
me
something
of
why
you
exist
of
why
there
is
anything
nature
i
will
answer
you
as
i
have
answered
for
so
many
centuries
all
those
who
have
interrogated
me
about
first
principles
i
know
nothing
about
them
the
philosopher
would
not
be
better
than
this
multitude
of
existences
made
in
order
to
be
continually
dissolved
this
crowd
of
animals
born
and
reproduced
in
order
to
devour
others
and
to
be
devoured
this
crowd
of
sentient
beings
formed
for
so
many
painful
sensations
that
other
crowd
of
intelligences
which
so
rarely
hear
reason
what
is
the
good
of
all
that
nature
nature
oh
go
and
ask
him
who
made
me
osmin
do
you
not
say
that
everything
is
necessary
selim
if
everything
were
not
necessary
it
would
follow
that
god
had
made
useless
things
osmin
that
is
to
say
that
it
was
necessary
to
the
divine
nature
to
make
all
that
it
has
made
selim
i
think
so
or
at
least
i
suspect
it
there
are
people
who
think
otherwise
i
do
not
understand
them
maybe
they
are
right
i
am
afraid
of
disputes
on
this
subject
osmin
it
is
also
of
another
necessary
that
i
want
to
talk
to
you
selim
what
of
what
is
necessary
to
an
honest
man
that
he
may
live
of
the
misfortune
to
which
one
is
reduced
when
one
lacks
the
necessary
osmin
no
for
what
is
necessary
to
one
is
not
always
necessary
to
the
other
it
is
necessary
for
an
indian
to
have
rice
for
an
englishman
to
have
meat
a
fur
is
necessary
to
a
russian
and
a
gauzy
stuff
to
an
african
this
man
thinks
that
twelve
are
necessary
to
him
that
man
limits
himself
to
a
pair
of
shoes
a
third
walks
gaily
barefoot
i
want
to
talk
to
you
of
what
is
necessary
to
all
men
selim
it
seems
to
me
that
god
has
given
all
that
is
necessary
to
this
species
eyes
to
see
with
feet
for
walking
a
mouth
for
eating
an
oesophagus
for
swallowing
a
stomach
for
digesting
a
brain
for
reasoning
organs
for
producing
one
fellow
creature
osmin
how
does
it
happen
then
that
men
are
born
lacking
a
part
of
these
necessary
things
selim
it
is
because
the
general
laws
of
nature
have
brought
about
some
accidents
which
have
made
monsters
to
be
born
but
generally
man
is
provided
with
everything
that
is
necessary
to
him
in
order
to
live
in
society
osmin
are
there
notions
common
to
all
men
which
serve
to
make
them
live
in
society
selim
yes
i
have
travelled
with
paul
lucas
and
wherever
i
went
i
saw
that
people
respected
their
father
and
their
mother
that
people
believed
themselves
to
be
obliged
to
keep
their
promises
that
people
pitied
oppressed
innocents
that
they
hated
persecution
that
they
regarded
liberty
of
thought
as
a
rule
of
nature
and
the
enemies
of
this
liberty
as
enemies
of
the
human
race
those
who
think
differently
seemed
to
me
badly
organized
creatures
monsters
like
those
who
are
born
without
eyes
and
hands
osmin
are
these
necessary
things
in
all
time
and
in
all
places
selim
yes
if
they
were
not
they
would
not
be
necessary
to
the
human
species
osmin
so
a
belief
which
is
new
is
not
necessary
to
this
species
men
could
very
well
live
in
society
and
accomplish
their
duty
to
god
before
believing
that
mahomet
had
frequent
interviews
with
the
angel
gabriel
selim
nothing
is
clearer
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
think
that
man
could
not
accomplish
his
duty
to
god
before
mahomet
came
into
the
world
it
was
not
at
all
necessary
for
the
human
species
to
believe
in
the
alcoran
the
world
went
along
before
mahomet
just
as
it
goes
along
if
mahometanism
had
been
necessary
to
the
world
it
would
have
existed
in
all
places
god
who
has
given
us
all
two
eyes
to
see
the
sun
would
have
given
us
all
an
intelligence
to
see
the
truth
of
the
mussulman
religion
this
sect
is
therefore
only
like
the
positive
laws
that
change
according
to
time
and
place
like
the
fashions
like
the
opinions
of
the
natural
philosophers
which
follow
one
after
the
other
the
mussulman
sect
could
not
be
essentially
necessary
to
mankind
osmin
but
since
it
exists
god
has
permitted
it
selim
yes
as
he
permits
the
world
to
be
filled
with
foolishness
error
and
calamity
that
is
not
to
say
that
men
are
all
essentially
made
to
be
fools
and
miscreants
he
permits
that
some
men
be
eaten
by
snakes
but
one
can
not
say
god
made
man
to
be
eaten
by
snakes
osmin
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
god
permits
can
nothing
happen
without
his
order
permit
will
and
do
are
they
not
the
same
thing
for
him
selim
he
permits
crime
but
he
does
not
commit
it
osmin
committing
a
crime
is
acting
against
divine
justice
it
is
disobeying
god
well
god
can
not
disobey
himself
he
can
not
commit
crime
but
he
has
made
man
in
such
a
way
that
man
may
commit
many
crimes
where
does
that
come
from
selim
there
are
people
who
know
but
i
do
not
all
that
i
know
is
that
the
alcoran
is
ridiculous
although
from
time
to
time
it
has
some
tolerably
good
things
certainly
the
alcoran
was
not
at
all
necessary
to
man
i
stick
by
that
i
see
clearly
what
is
false
and
i
know
very
little
that
is
true
osmin
i
thought
you
would
instruct
me
and
you
teach
me
nothing
selim
is
it
not
a
great
deal
to
recognize
people
who
deceive
you
and
the
gross
and
dangerous
errors
which
they
retail
to
you
osmin
i
should
have
ground
for
complaint
against
a
doctor
who
showed
me
all
the
harmful
plants
and
who
did
not
show
me
one
salutary
plant
selim
i
am
not
a
doctor
and
you
are
not
ill
but
it
seems
to
me
i
should
be
giving
you
a
very
good
prescription
if
i
said
to
you
put
not
your
trust
in
all
the
inventions
of
charlatans
worship
god
be
an
honest
man
and
believe
that
two
and
two
make
four
it
seems
that
the
first
words
of
ovid
metamorphoses
nova
fert
are
the
motto
of
the
human
race
nobody
is
touched
by
the
admirable
spectacle
of
the
sun
which
rises
or
rather
seems
to
rise
every
day
everybody
runs
to
see
the
smallest
little
meteor
which
appears
for
an
instant
in
that
accumulation
of
vapours
called
the
sky
that
surround
the
earth
an

not

with

new

it
be
detestable
he
draws
you
aside

says
to

do
you
want
some

from

from

the
fickleness
that
is
imputed
to
them
in
favour
of
the
first
new
object
which
presents
itself
and
whose
novelty
is
often
its
only
merit
many
ladies
it
must
be
confessed
despite
the
infinite
respect
we
have
for
them
have
treated
men
as
they
complain
they
have
themselves
been
treated
and
the
story
of
gioconda
is
much
older
than
ariosto
perhaps
this
universal
taste
for
novelty
is
one
of
nature
favours
people
cry
to
us
be
content
with
what
you
have
desire
nothing
that
is
beyond
your
estate
restrain
your
curiosity
tame
your
intellectual
disquiet
these
are
very
good
maxims
but
if
we
had
always
followed
them
we
should
still
be
eating
acorns
we
should
be
sleeping
in
the
open
air
and
we
should
not
have
had
corneille
racine
molière
poussin
lebrun
lemoine
or
pigalle
philosopher
of
that
is
to
say
all
philosophers
have
had
this
dual
character
there
is
not
one
in
antiquity
who
has
not
given
mankind
examples
of
virtue
and
lessons
in
moral
truths
they
have
all
contrived
to
be
deceived
about
natural
philosophy
but
natural
philosophy
is
so
little
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
life
that
the
philosophers
had
no
need
of
it
it
has
taken
centuries
to
learn
a
part
of
nature
laws
one
day
was
sufficient
for
a
wise
man
to
learn
the
duties
of
man
the
philosopher
is
not
enthusiastic
he
does
not
set
himself
up
as
a
prophet
he
does
not
say
that
he
is
inspired
by
the
gods
thus
i
shall
not
put
in
the
rank
of
philosophers
either
the
ancient
zarathustra
or
hermes
or
the
ancient
orpheus
or
any
of
those
legislators
of
whom
the
nations
of
chaldea
persia
syria
egypt
and
greece
boasted
those
who
styled
themselves
children
of
the
gods
were
the
fathers
of
imposture
and
if
they
used
lies
for
the
teaching
of
truths
they
were
unworthy
of
teaching
them
they
were
not
philosophers
they
were
at
best
very
prudent
liars
by
what
fatality
shameful
maybe
for
the
western
peoples
is
it
necessary
to
go
to
the
far
orient
to
find
a
wise
man
who
is
simple
unostentatious
free
from
imposture
who
taught
men
to
live
happily
six
hundred
years
before
our
vulgar
era
at
a
time
when
the
whole
of
the
north
was
ignorant
of
the
usage
of
letters
and
when
the
greeks
were
barely
beginning
to
distinguish
themselves
by
their
wisdom
this
wise
man
is
confucius
who
being
legislator
never
wanted
to
deceive
men
what
more
beautiful
rule
of
conduct
has
ever
been
given
since
him
in
the
whole
world
rule
a
state
as
you
rule
a
family
one
can
only
govern
one
family
well
by
setting
the
example
virtue
should
be
common
to
both
husbandman
and
monarch
apply
thyself
to
the
trouble
of
preventing
crimes
in
order
to
lessen
the
trouble
of
punishing
them
under
the
good
kings
yao
and
xu
the
chinese
were
good
under
the
bad
kings
kie
and
chu
they
were
wicked
do
to
others
as
to
thyself
love
all
men
but
cherish
honest
people
forget
injuries
and
never
kindnesses
i
have
seen
men
incapable
of
study
i
have
never
seen
them
incapable
of
virtue
let
us
admit
that
there
is
no
legislator
who
has
proclaimed
truths
more
useful
to
the
human
race
a
host
of
greek
philosophers
have
since
taught
an
equally
pure
moral
philosophy
if
they
had
limited
themselves
to
their
empty
systems
of
natural
philosophy
their
names
would
be
pronounced
in
mockery
only
if
they
are
still
respected
it
is
because
they
were
just
and
that
they
taught
men
to
be
so
one
can
not
read
certain
passages
of
plato
and
notably
the
admirable
exordium
of
the
laws
of
zaleucus
without
feeling
in
one
heart
the
love
of
honourable
and
generous
actions
the
romans
have
their
cicero
who
alone
is
worth
perhaps
all
the
philosophers
of
greece
after
him
come
men
still
more
worthy
of
respect
but
whom
one
almost
despairs
of
imitating
epictetus
in
bondage
the
antonines
and
the
julians
on
the
throne
which
is
the
citizen
among
us
who
would
deprive
himself
like
julian
antoninus
and
marcus
aurelius
of
all
the
delicacies
of
our
flabby
and
effeminate
lives
who
would
sleep
as
they
did
on
the
ground
who
would
impose
on
himself
their
frugality
who
as
they
did
would
march
barefoot
and
bareheaded
at
the
head
of
the
armies
exposed
now
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
now
to
the
who
would
command
all
their
passions
as
they
did
there
are
pious
men
among
us
but
where
are
the
wise
men
where
are
the
resolute
just
and
tolerant
souls
there
have
been
philosophers
of
the
study
in
france
and
all
except
montaigne
have
been
persecuted
it
is
i
think
the
last
degree
of
the
malignity
of
our
nature
to
wish
to
oppress
these
very
philosophers
who
would
correct
it
i
quite
understand
that
the
fanatics
of
one
sect
slaughter
the
enthusiasts
of
another
sect
that
the
franciscans
hate
the
dominicans
and
that
a
bad
artist
intrigues
to
ruin
one
who
surpasses
him
but
that
the
wise
charron
should
have
been
threatened
with
the
loss
of
his
life
that
the
learned
and
generous
ramus
should
have
been
assassinated
that
descartes
should
have
been
forced
to
flee
to
holland
to
escape
the
fury
of
the
ignorant
that
gassendi
should
have
been
obliged
to
withdraw
several
times
to
digne
far
from
the
calumnies
of
paris
these
things
are
a
nation
eternal
shame
i
suppose
that
the
man
who
reads
this
article
is
convinced
that
this
world
is
formed
with
intelligence
and
that
a
little
astronomy
and
anatomy
suffices
to
make
this
universal
and
supreme
intelligence
admired
can
he
know
by
himself
if
this
intelligence
is
omnipotent
that
is
to
say
infinitely
powerful
has
he
the
least
notion
of
the
infinite
to
understand
what
is
an
infinite
power
the
celebrated
historian
philosopher
david
hume
says
in
particular
providence
a
weight
of
ten
ounces
is
lifted
in
a
balance
by
another
weight
therefore
this
other
weight
is
of
more
than
ten
ounces
but
one
can
adduce
no
reason
why
it
should
weigh
a
hundred
ounces
one
can
say
likewise
you
recognize
a
supreme
intelligence
strong
enough
to
form
you
to
preserve
you
for
a
limited
time
to
reward
you
to
punish
you
do
you
know
enough
of
this
power
to
demonstrate
that
it
can
do
still
more
how
can
you
prove
by
your
reason
that
this
being
can
do
more
than
he
has
done
the
life
of
all
animals
is
short
could
he
make
it
longer
all
animals
are
the
prey
of
each
other
everything
is
born
to
be
devoured
could
he
form
without
destroying
you
do
not
know
what
nature
is
you
can
not
therefore
know
if
nature
has
not
forced
him
to
do
only
the
things
he
has
done
this
globe
is
only
a
vast
field
of
destruction
and
carnage
either
the
great
being
has
been
able
to
make
of
it
an
eternal
abode
of
delight
for
all
sentient
beings
or
he
has
not
been
able
if
he
has
been
able
and
if
he
has
not
done
so
fear
to
regard
him
as
malevolent
but
if
he
has
not
been
able
fear
not
to
look
on
him
as
a
very
great
power
circumscribed
by
nature
in
his
limits
whether
or
no
his
power
is
infinite
does
not
regard
you
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
a
subject
whether
his
master
possesses
five
hundred
leagues
of
land
or
five
thousand
he
is
subject
neither
more
nor
less
which
would
be
the
greater
insult
to
this
ineffable
being
to
say
he
has
made
miserable
men
without
being
able
to
dispense
with
them
or
he
has
made
them
for
his
pleasure
many
sects
represent
him
as
cruel
others
for
fear
of
admitting
a
wicked
god
have
the
audacity
to
deny
his
existence
is
it
not
better
to
say
that
probably
the
necessity
of
his
nature
and
the
necessity
of
things
have
determined
everything
the
world
is
the
theatre
of
moral
ill
and
physical
ill
one
is
only
too
aware
of
it
and
the
all
is
good
of
shaftesbury
bolingbroke
and
pope
is
only
a
witty
paradox
a
poor
joke
the
two
principles
of
zarathustra
and
manes
so
carefully
scrutinized
by
bayle
are
a
still
poorer
joke
they
are
as
has
been
observed
already
molière
two
doctors
one
of
whom
says
to
the
other
grant
me
the
emetic
and
i
will
grant
you
the
bleeding
manichæism
is
absurd
and
that
is
why
it
has
had
so
many
supporters
i
admit
that
i
have
not
been
enlightened
by
all
that
bayle
says
about
the
manichæans
and
the
paulicians
that
is
controversy
i
would
have
preferred
pure
philosophy
why
discuss
our
mysteries
beside
zarathustra
as
soon
as
you
dare
to
treat
of
our
mysteries
which
need
only
faith
and
no
reasoning
you
open
precipices
for
yourself
the
trash
in
our
scholastic
theology
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
trash
in
zarathustra
reveries
why
debate
original
sin
with
zarathustra
there
was
never
any
question
of
it
save
in
augustine
time
neither
zarathustra
nor
any
legislator
of
antiquity
had
ever
heard
speak
of
it
if
you
dispute
with
zarathustra
put
under
lock
and
key
the
old
and
the
new
testaments
which
he
did
not
know
and
which
one
must
revere
without
desiring
to
explain
them
what
then
should
i
have
said
to
zarathustra
my
reason
can
not
admit
two
gods
who
fight
that
is
good
only
in
a
poem
where
minerva
quarrels
with
mars
my
feeble
reason
is
much
more
content
with
a
single
great
being
whose
essence
was
to
make
and
who
has
made
all
that
nature
has
permitted
him
than
it
is
satisfied
with
two
great
beings
one
of
whom
spoils
the
works
of
the
other
your
bad
principle
ahriman
has
not
been
able
to
upset
a
single
one
of
the
astronomical
and
physical
laws
of
the
good
principle
ormuzd
everything
progresses
in
the
heavens
with
the
greatest
regularity
why
should
the
wicked
ahriman
have
had
power
over
this
little
globe
of
the
world
if
i
had
been
ahriman
i
should
have
attacked
ormuzd
in
his
fine
grand
provinces
of
so
many
suns
and
stars
i
should
not
have
limited
myself
to
making
war
on
him
in
a
little
village
there
is
much
evil
in
this
village
but
whence
have
you
the
knowledge
that
this
evil
is
not
inevitable
you
are
forced
to
admit
an
intelligence
diffused
over
the
universe
but
do
you
know
for
instance
if
this
power
reaches
right
to
foreseeing
the
future
you
have
asserted
it
a
thousand
times
but
you
have
never
been
able
either
to
prove
it
or
to
understand
it
you
can
not
know
how
any
being
whatever
sees
what
is
not
well
the
future
is
not
therefore
no
being
can
see
it
you
are
reduced
to
saying
that
he
foresees
it
but
foreseeing
is
conjecturing
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
socinians
well
a
god
who
according
to
you
conjectures
can
be
mistaken
in
your
system
he
is
really
mistaken
for
if
he
had
foreseen
that
his
enemy
would
poison
all
his
works
here
below
he
would
not
have
produced
them
he
would
not
have
prepared
for
himself
the
shame
of
being
continually
vanquished
do
i
not
do
him
much
more
honour
by
saying
that
he
has
made
everything
by
the
necessity
of
his
nature
than
you
do
him
by
raising
an
enemy
who
disfigures
who
soils
who
destroys
all
his
works
here
below
it
is
not
to
have
an
unworthy
idea
of
god
to
say
that
having
formed
thousands
of
millions
of
worlds
where
death
and
evil
do
not
dwell
it
was
necessary
that
evil
and
death
should
dwell
in
this
world
it
is
not
to
disparage
god
to
say
that
he
could
not
form
man
without
giving
him
that
this
could
not
lead
him
without
misguiding
him
almost
always
that
his
passions
are
necessary
but
that
they
are
disastrous
that
propagation
can
not
be
executed
without
desire
that
desire
can
not
animate
man
without
quarrels
that
these
quarrels
necessarily
bring
wars
in
their
train
etc
when
he
sees
part
of
the
combinations
of
the
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
kingdoms
and
this
globe
pierced
everywhere
like
a
sieve
from
which
escape
in
crowds
so
many
exhalations
what
philosopher
will
be
bold
enough
what
scholastic
foolish
enough
to
see
clearly
that
nature
could
stop
the
effects
of
volcanoes
the
inclemencies
of
the
atmosphere
the
violence
of
the
winds
the
plagues
and
all
the
destructive
scourges
one
must
be
very
powerful
very
strong
very
industrious
to
have
formed
lions
which
devour
bulls
and
to
have
produced
men
who
invent
arms
to
kill
at
one
blow
not
only
bulls
and
lions
but
even
each
other
one
must
be
very
powerful
to
have
caused
to
be
born
spiders
which
spin
webs
to
catch
flies
but
that
is
not
to
be
omnipotent
infinitely
powerful
if
the
great
being
had
been
infinitely
powerful
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
not
have
made
sentient
animals
infinitely
happy
he
has
not
done
so
therefore
he
was
not
able
all
the
sects
of
the
philosophers
have
stranded
on
the
reef
of
moral
and
physical
ill
it
only
remains
to
avow
that
god
having
acted
for
the
best
has
not
been
able
to
act
better
this
necessity
settles
all
the
difficulties
and
finishes
all
the
disputes
we
have
not
the
impudence
to
say
all
is
good
we
say
all
is
the
least
bad
that
is
possible
why
does
a
child
often
die
in
its
mother
womb
why
is
another
who
has
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
reserved
for
torments
as
long
as
his
life
terminated
by
a
frightful
death
why
has
the
source
of
life
been
poisoned
all
over
the
world
since
the
discovery
of
america
why
since
the
seventh
century
of
our
era
does
smallpox
carry
off
the
eighth
part
of
the
human
race
why
since
all
time
have
bladders
been
subject
to
being
stone
quarries
why
the
plague
war
famine
the
inquisition
turn
in
every
direction
you
will
find
no
other
solution
than
that
everything
has
been
necessary
i
speak
here
to
philosophers
only
and
not
to
theologians
we
know
well
that
faith
is
the
thread
in
the
labyrinth
we
know
that
the
fall
of
adam
and
eve
original
sin
the
immense
power
given
to
the
devil
the
predilection
accorded
by
the
great
being
to
the
jewish
people
and
the
baptism
substituted
for
the
amputation
of
the
prepuce
are
the
answers
which
explain
everything
we
have
argued
only
against
zarathustra
and
not
against
the
university
of
conimbre
or
coïmbre
to
which
we
submit
in
our
articles
we
do
not
know
any
religion
without
prayers
even
the
jews
had
some
although
there
was
not
among
them
any
public
form
until
the
time
when
they
sang
canticles
in
their
synagogues
which
happened
very
late
all
men
in
their
desires
and
their
fears
invoked
the
aid
of
a
deity
some
philosophers
more
respectful
to
the
supreme
being
and
less
condescending
to
human
frailty
for
all
prayer
desired
only
resignation
it
is
indeed
what
seems
proper
as
between
creature
and
creator
but
philosophy
is
not
made
to
govern
the
world
she
rises
above
the
common
herd
she
speaks
a
language
that
the
crowd
can
not
understand
it
would
be
suggesting
to
fishwives
that
they
should
study
conic
sections
even
among
the
philosophers
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
apart
from
maximus
of
tyre
has
treated
of
this
matter
this
is
the
substance
of
maximus
ideas
the
eternal
has
his
intentions
from
all
eternity
if
prayer
accords
with
his
immutable
wishes
it
is
quite
useless
to
ask
of
him
what
he
has
resolved
to
do
if
one
prays
him
to
do
the
contrary
of
what
he
has
resolved
it
is
praying
him
to
be
weak
frivolous
inconstant
it
is
believing
that
he
is
thus
it
is
to
mock
him
either
you
ask
him
a
just
thing
in
this
case
he
must
do
it
and
the
thing
will
be
done
without
your
praying
him
for
it
entreating
him
is
even
to
distrust
him
or
the
thing
is
unjust
and
then
you
outrage
him
you
are
worthy
or
unworthy
of
the
grace
you
implore
if
worthy
he
knows
it
better
than
you
if
unworthy
you
commit
a
crime
the
more
in
asking
for
what
you
do
not
deserve
in
a
word
we
pray
to
god
only
because
we
have
made
him
in
our
own
image
we
treat
him
like
a
pasha
like
a
sultan
whom
one
may
provoke
and
appease
in
short
all
nations
pray
to
god
wise
men
resign
themselves
and
obey
him
let
us
pray
with
the
people
and
resign
ourselves
with
the
wise
men
of
ancient
i
have
spent
nearly
forty
years
of
my
pilgrimage
in
two
or
three
corners
of
this
world
seeking
the
philosopher
stone
that
is
called
truth
i
have
consulted
all
the
adepts
of
antiquity
epicurus
and
augustine
plato
and
malebranche
and
i
have
remained
in
my
poverty
maybe
in
all
these
philosophers
crucibles
there
are
one
or
two
ounces
of
gold
but
all
the
rest
is
residue
dull
mud
from
which
nothing
can
be
born
it
seems
to
me
that
the
greeks
our
masters
wrote
much
more
to
show
their
intelligence
than
that
they
used
their
intelligence
in
order
to
learn
i
do
not
see
a
single
author
of
antiquity
who
had
a
coherent
system
a
clear
methodical
system
progressing
from
consequence
to
consequence
when
i
wanted
to
compare
and
combine
the
systems
of
plato
of
the
preceptor
of
alexander
of
pythagoras
and
of
the
orientals
here
more
or
less
is
what
i
was
able
to
gather
chance
is
a
word
empty
of
sense
nothing
can
exist
without
a
cause
the
world
is
arranged
according
to
mathematical
laws
it
is
therefore
arranged
by
an
intelligence
it
is
not
an
intelligent
being
such
as
i
am
who
directed
the
formation
of
this
world
for
i
can
not
form
a
mite
therefore
this
world
is
the
work
of
a
prodigiously
superior
intelligence
does
this
being
who
possesses
intelligence
and
power
in
so
high
a
degree
exist
necessarily
it
must
be
so
for
either
the
being
received
existence
from
another
or
from
its
own
nature
if
the
being
received
existence
from
another
which
is
very
difficult
to
imagine
i
must
have
recourse
to
this
other
and
this
other
will
be
the
prime
author
to
whichever
side
i
turn
i
have
to
admit
a
prime
author
potent
and
intelligent
who
is
such
necessarily
by
his
own
nature
did
this
prime
author
produce
things
out
of
nothing
that
is
not
imaginable
to
create
out
of
nothing
is
to
change
nothing
into
something
i
must
not
admit
such
a
production
unless
i
find
invincible
reasons
which
force
me
to
admit
what
my
intelligence
can
never
comprehend
all
that
exists
appears
to
exist
necessarily
since
it
exists
for
if
there
is
a
reason
for
the
existence
of
things
there
was
one
yesterday
there
was
one
in
all
time
and
this
cause
must
always
have
had
its
effect
without
which
it
would
have
been
during
eternity
a
useless
cause
but
how
shall
things
have
always
existed
being
visibly
under
the
hand
of
the
prime
author
this
power
therefore
must
always
have
acted
in
the
same
way
nearly
that
there
is
no
sun
without
light
so
there
is
no
movement
without
a
being
that
passes
from
one
point
of
space
to
another
point
there
is
therefore
a
potent
and
intelligent
being
who
has
always
acted
and
if
this
being
had
never
acted
of
what
use
would
his
existence
have
been
to
him
all
things
are
therefore
eternal
emanations
of
this
prime
author
but
how
imagine
that
stone
and
mud
are
emanations
of
the
eternal
being
potent
and
intelligent
of
two
things
one
either
the
matter
of
this
stone
and
this
mud
exist
necessarily
by
themselves
or
they
exist
necessarily
through
this
prime
author
there
is
no
middle
course
thus
therefore
there
are
only
two
choices
to
make
admit
either
matter
eternal
by
itself
or
matter
issuing
eternally
from
the
potent
intelligent
eternal
being
but
either
subsisting
by
its
own
nature
or
emanated
from
the
producing
being
it
exists
from
all
eternity
because
it
exists
and
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
existed
before
if
matter
is
eternally
necessary
it
is
therefore
impossible
it
is
therefore
contradictory
that
it
does
not
exist
but
what
man
can
affirm
that
it
is
impossible
that
it
is
contradictory
that
this
pebble
and
this
fly
have
not
existence
one
is
nevertheless
forced
to
suppress
this
difficulty
which
astonishes
the
imagination
more
than
it
contradicts
the
principles
of
reasoning
in
fact
as
soon
as
you
have
imagined
that
everything
has
emanated
from
the
supreme
and
intelligent
being
that
nothing
has
emanated
from
the
being
without
reason
that
this
being
existing
always
must
always
have
acted
that
consequently
all
things
must
have
eternally
issued
from
the
womb
of
his
existence
you
should
no
more
refuse
to
believe
in
the
matter
of
which
this
pebble
and
this
fly
an
eternal
production
are
formed
than
you
refuse
to
imagine
light
as
an
eternal
emanation
from
the
omnipotent
being
since
i
am
a
being
with
extension
and
thought
my
extension
and
my
thought
are
therefore
necessary
productions
of
this
being
it
is
evident
to
me
that
i
can
not
give
myself
either
extension
or
thought
i
have
therefore
received
both
from
this
necessary
being
can
he
give
me
what
he
has
not
i
have
intelligence
and
i
am
in
space
therefore
he
is
intelligent
and
he
is
in
space
to
say
that
this
eternal
being
this
omnipotent
god
has
from
all
time
necessarily
filled
the
universe
with
his
productions
is
not
to
deprive
him
of
his
liberty
on
the
contrary
for
liberty
is
only
the
power
of
acting
god
has
always
acted
to
the
full
therefore
god
has
always
made
use
of
the
fullness
of
his
liberty
the
liberty
that
is
called
of
is
a
phrase
without
idea
an
absurdity
for
it
would
be
determination
without
reason
it
would
be
an
effect
without
a
cause
therefore
god
can
not
have
this
liberty
which
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
he
has
therefore
always
acted
through
this
same
necessity
which
makes
his
existence
it
is
therefore
impossible
for
the
world
to
be
without
god
it
is
impossible
for
god
to
be
without
the
world
this
world
is
filled
with
beings
who
succeed
each
other
therefore
god
has
always
produced
beings
who
succeed
each
other
these
preliminary
assertions
are
the
basis
of
the
ancient
oriental
philosophy
and
of
that
of
the
greeks
one
must
except
democritus
and
epicurus
whose
corpuscular
philosophy
combated
these
dogmas
but
let
us
remark
that
the
epicureans
relied
on
an
entirely
erroneous
natural
philosophy
and
that
the
metaphysical
system
of
all
the
other
philosophers
holds
good
with
all
the
systems
of
natural
philosophy
the
whole
of
nature
excepting
the
vacuum
contradicts
epicurus
and
no
phenomenon
contradicts
the
philosophy
which
i
have
just
explained
well
is
not
a
philosophy
which
is
in
accord
with
all
that
passes
in
nature
and
which
contents
the
most
careful
minds
superior
to
all
other
systems
after
the
assertions
of
the
ancient
philosophers
which
i
have
reconciled
as
far
as
has
been
possible
for
me
what
is
left
to
us
a
chaos
of
doubts
and
chimeras
i
do
not
think
that
there
has
ever
been
a
philosopher
with
a
system
who
did
not
at
the
end
of
his
life
avow
that
he
had
wasted
his
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
inventors
of
the
mechanical
arts
have
been
much
more
useful
to
mankind
than
the
inventors
of
syllogisms
the
man
who
invented
the
shuttle
surpasses
with
a
vengeance
the
man
who
imagined
innate
ideas
prejudice
is
an
opinion
without
judgment
thus
all
over
the
world
do
people
inspire
children
with
all
the
opinions
they
desire
before
the
children
can
judge
there
are
some
universal
necessary
prejudices
which
even
make
virtue
in
all
countries
children
are
taught
to
recognize
a
rewarding
and
revenging
god
to
respect
and
love
their
father
and
their
mother
to
look
on
theft
as
a
crime
selfish
lying
as
a
vice
before
they
can
guess
what
is
a
vice
and
what
a
virtue
there
are
then
some
very
good
prejudices
they
are
those
which
are
ratified
by
judgment
when
one
reasons
sentiment
is
not
a
simple
prejudice
it
is
something
much
stronger
a
mother
does
not
love
her
son
because
she
has
been
told
she
must
love
him
she
cherishes
him
happily
in
spite
of
herself
it
is
not
through
prejudice
that
you
run
to
the
help
of
an
unknown
child
about
to
fall
into
a
precipice
or
be
eaten
by
a
beast
but
it
is
through
prejudice
that
you
will
respect
a
man
clad
in
certain
clothes
walking
gravely
speaking
likewise
your
parents
have
told
you
that
you
should
bow
before
this
man
you
respect
him
before
knowing
whether
he
merits
your
respect
you
grow
in
years
and
in
knowledge
you
perceive
that
this
man
is
a
charlatan
steeped
in
arrogance
and
artifice
you
despise
what
you
revered
and
the
prejudice
cedes
to
judgment
through
prejudice
you
have
believed
the
fables
with
which
your
childhood
was
cradled
you
have
been
told
that
the
titans
made
war
on
the
gods
and
venus
was
amorous
of
adonis
when
you
are
twelve
you
accept
these
fables
as
truths
when
you
are
twenty
you
look
on
them
as
ingenious
allegories
let
us
examine
briefly
the
different
sorts
of
prejudices
so
as
to
set
our
affairs
in
order
we
shall
be
perhaps
like
those
who
at
the
time
of
law
system
perceived
that
they
had
calculated
imaginary
riches
prejudices
of
the
senses
is
it
not
strange
that
our
eyes
always
deceive
us
even
when
we
have
very
good
sight
and
that
on
the
contrary
our
ears
do
not
deceive
us
let
your
ear
hear
you
are
beautiful
i
love
you
it
is
quite
certain
that
someone
has
not
said
i
hate
you
you
are
ugly
but
you
see
a
smooth
mirror
it
is
demonstrated
that
you
are
mistaken
it
has
a
very
uneven
surface
you
see
the
sun
as
about
two
feet
in
diameter
it
is
demonstrated
that
it
is
a
million
times
bigger
than
the
earth
it
seems
that
god
has
put
truth
in
your
ears
and
error
in
your
eyes
but
study
optics
and
you
will
see
that
god
has
not
deceived
you
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
objects
to
appear
to
you
otherwise
than
you
see
them
in
the
present
state
of
things
physical
prejudices
the
sun
rises
the
moon
also
the
earth
is
motionless
these
are
natural
physical
prejudices
but
that
lobsters
are
good
for
the
blood
because
when
cooked
they
are
red
that
eels
cure
paralysis
because
they
wriggle
that
the
moon
affects
our
maladies
because
one
day
someone
observed
that
a
sick
man
had
an
increase
of
fever
during
the
waning
of
the
moon
these
ideas
and
a
thousand
others
are
the
errors
of
ancient
charlatans
who
judged
without
reasoning
and
who
being
deceived
deceived
others
historical
prejudices
most
historical
stories
have
been
believed
without
examination
and
this
belief
is
a
prejudice
fabius
pictor
relates
that
many
centuries
before
him
a
vestal
of
the
town
of
alba
going
to
draw
water
in
her
pitcher
was
ravished
that
she
gave
birth
to
romulus
and
remus
that
they
were
fed
by
a
etc
the
roman
people
believed
this
fable
they
did
not
examine
whether
at
that
time
there
were
vestals
in
latium
whether
it
were
probable
that
a
king
daughter
would
leave
her
convent
with
her
pitcher
whether
it
were
likely
that
a
would
suckle
two
children
instead
of
eating
them
the
prejudice
established
itself
a
monk
writes
that
clovis
being
in
great
danger
at
the
battle
of
tolbiac
made
a
vow
to
turn
christian
if
he
escaped
but
is
it
natural
to
address
oneself
to
a
foreign
god
on
such
an
occasion
is
it
not
then
that
the
religion
in
which
one
was
born
acts
most
potently
which
is
the
christian
who
in
a
battle
against
the
turks
will
not
address
himself
to
the
holy
virgin
rather
than
to
mohammed
it
is
added
that
a
pigeon
brought
the
holy
phial
in
its
beak
to
anoint
clovis
and
that
an
angel
brought
the
oriflamme
to
lead
him
prejudice
believed
all
the
little
stories
of
this
kind
those
who
understand
human
nature
know
well
that
clovis
the
usurper
and
rolon
or
rol
the
usurper
turned
christian
in
order
to
govern
the
christians
more
surely
just
as
the
turkish
usurpers
turned
mussulman
in
order
to
govern
the
mussulmans
more
surely
religious
prejudices
if
your
nurse
has
told
you
that
ceres
rules
over
the
crops
or
that
vistnou
and
xaca
made
themselves
men
several
times
or
that
sammonocodom
came
to
cut
down
a
forest
or
that
odin
awaits
you
in
his
hall
near
jutland
or
that
mohammed
or
somebody
else
made
a
journey
into
the
sky
if
lastly
your
tutor
comes
to
drive
into
your
brain
what
your
nurse
has
imprinted
on
it
you
keep
it
for
life
if
your
judgment
wishes
to
rise
against
these
prejudices
your
neighbours
and
above
all
your
neighbours
wives
cry
out
impious
reprobate
and
dismay
you
your
dervish
fearing
to
see
his
income
diminish
accuses
you
to
the
cadi
and
this
cadi
has
you
impaled
if
he
can
because
he
likes
ruling
over
fools
and
thinks
that
fools
obey
better
than
others
and
that
will
last
until
your
neighbours
and
the
dervish
and
the
cadi
begin
to
understand
that
foolishness
is
good
for
nothing
and
that
persecution
is
abominable
rare
in
natural
philosophy
is
the
opposite
of
dense
in
moral
philosophy
it
is
the
opposite
of
common
this
last
variety
of
rare
is
what
excites
admiration
one
never
admires
what
is
common
one
enjoys
it
an
eccentric
thinks
himself
above
the
rest
of
wretched
mortals
when
he
has
in
his
study
a
rare
medal
that
is
good
for
nothing
a
rare
book
that
nobody
has
the
courage
to
read
an
old
engraving
by
albrecht
durer
badly
designed
and
badly
printed
he
triumphs
if
he
has
in
his
garden
a
stunted
tree
from
america
this
eccentric
has
no
taste
he
has
only
vanity
he
has
heard
say
that
the
beautiful
is
rare
but
he
should
know
that
all
that
is
rare
is
not
beautiful
beauty
is
rare
in
all
nature
works
and
in
all
works
of
art
whatever
ill
things
have
been
said
of
women
i
maintain
that
it
is
rarer
to
find
women
perfectly
beautiful
than
passibly
good
you
will
meet
in
the
country
ten
thousand
women
attached
to
their
homes
laborious
sober
feeding
rearing
teaching
their
children
and
you
will
find
barely
one
whom
you
could
show
at
the
theatres
of
paris
london
naples
or
in
the
public
gardens
and
who
would
be
looked
on
as
a
beauty
likewise
in
works
of
art
you
have
ten
thousand
daubs
and
scrawls
to
one
masterpiece
if
everything
were
beautiful
and
good
it
is
clear
that
one
would
no
longer
admire
anything
one
would
enjoy
but
would
one
have
pleasure
in
enjoying
that
is
a
big
question
why
have
the
beautiful
passages
in
the
cid
the
horaces
cinna
had
such
a
prodigious
success
because
in
the
profound
night
in
which
people
were
plunged
they
suddenly
saw
shine
a
new
light
that
they
did
not
expect
it
was
because
this
beauty
was
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
the
groves
of
versailles
were
a
beauty
unique
in
the
world
as
were
then
certain
passages
of
corneille
peter
rome
is
unique
but
let
us
suppose
that
all
the
churches
of
europe
were
equal
to
peter
rome
that
all
statues
were
venus
dei
medici
that
all
tragedies
were
as
beautiful
as
racine
iphigénie
all
works
of
poetry
as
well
written
as
boileau
art
poétique
all
comedies
as
good
as
tartufe
and
thus
in
every
sphere
would
you
then
have
as
much
pleasure
in
enjoying
masterpieces
become
common
as
they
made
you
taste
when
they
were
rare
i
say
boldly
no
and
i
believe
that
the
ancient
school
which
so
rarely
was
right
was
right
when
it
said
assuetis
non
fit
habit
does
not
make
passion
but
my
dear

will
it
be
the
same
with
the
works
of
nature
will
you
be
disgusted
if
all
the
maids
are
so
beautiful
as
helen
and
you
ladies
if
all
the
lads
are
like
paris
let
us
suppose
that
all
wines
are
excellent
will
you
have
less
desire
to
drink
if
the
partridges
pheasants
pullets
are
common
at
all
times
will
you
have
less
appetite
i
say
boldly
again
no
despite
the
axiom
of
the
schools
habit
does
not
make
passion
and
the
reason
you
know
it
is
that
all
the
pleasures
which
nature
gives
us
are
always
recurring
needs
necessary
enjoyments
and
that
the
pleasures
of
the
arts
are
not
necessary
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
man
to
have
groves
where
water
gushes
to
a
height
of
a
hundred
feet
from
the
mouth
of
a
marble
face
and
on
leaving
these
groves
to
go
to
see
a
fine
tragedy
but
the
two
sexes
are
always
necessary
to
each
other
the
table
and
the
bed
are
necessities
the
habit
of
being
alternately
on
these
two
thrones
will
never
disgust
you
in
paris
a
few
years
ago
people
admired
a
rhinoceros
if
there
were
in
one
province
ten
thousand
rhinoceroses
men
would
run
after
them
only
to
kill
them
but
let
there
be
a
hundred
thousand
beautiful
women
men
will
always
run
after
them
to
honour
them
at
the
time
when
all
france
was
mad
about
law
system
and
law
was
there
came
to
him
in
the
presence
of
a
great
assembly
a
man
who
was
always
right
who
always
had
reason
on
his
side
said
he
to
law
sir
you
are
the
biggest
madman
the
biggest
fool
or
the
biggest
rogue
who
has
yet
appeared
among
us
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
this
is
how
i
prove
it
you
have
imagined
that
a
state
wealth
can
be
increased
tenfold
with
paper
but
as
this
paper
can
represent
only
the
money
that
is
representative
of
true
wealth
the
products
of
the
land
and
industry
you
should
have
begun
by
giving
us
ten
times
more
corn
wine
cloth
canvas
etc
that
is
not
enough
you
must
be
sure
of
your
market
but
you
make
ten
times
as
many
notes
as
we
have
of
silver
and
commodities
therefore
you
are
ten
times
more
extravagant
or
more
inept
or
more
of
a
rogue
than
all
the
comptrollers
who
have
preceded
you
this
is
how
i
prove
my
major
hardly
had
he
started
his
major
than
he
was
conducted
to
when
he
came
out
of
where
he
studied
much
and
strengthened
his
reason
he
went
to
rome
he
asked
for
a
public
audience
of
the
pope
on
condition
that
he
was
not
interrupted
in
his
harangue
and
he
spoke
to
the
pope
in
these
terms
holy
father
you
are
an
antichrist
and
this
is
how
i
prove
it
to
your
holiness
i
call
antichrist
the
man
who
does
the
contrary
to
what
christ
did
and
commanded
now
christ
was
poor
and
you
are
very
rich
he
paid
tribute
and
you
exact
tribute
he
submitted
to
the
powers
that
were
and
you
have
become
a
power
he
walked
on
foot
and
you
go
to
in
a
sumptuous
equipage
he
ate
all
that
one
was
so
good
as
to
give
him
and
you
want
us
to
eat
fish
on
friday
and
saturday
when
we
live
far
from
sea
and
river
he
forbade
simon
barjona
to
use
a
sword
and
you
have
swords
in
your
service
etc
therefore
in
this
sense
your
holiness
is
antichrist
in
every
other
sense
i
hold
you
in
great
veneration
and
i
ask
you
for
an
indulgence
articulo
my
man
was
put
in
the
castello
angelo
when
he
came
out
of
the
castello
angelo
he
rushed
to
venice
and
asked
to
speak
to
the
doge
your
serenity
he
said
must
be
a
to
marry
the
sea
every
year
for
firstly
one
only
marries
the
same
person
once
secondly
your
marriage
resembles
harlequin
which
was
half
made
seeing
that
it
lacked
but
the
consent
of
the
bride
thirdly
who
has
told
you
that
one
day
other
maritime
powers
will
not
declare
you
incapable
of
consummating
the
marriage
he
spoke
and
was
shut
up
in
the
tower
of
mark
when
he
came
out
of
the
tower
of
mark
he
went
to
constantinople
he
had
audience
of
the
mufti
and
spoke
to
him
in
these
terms
your
religion
although
it
has
some
good
points
such
as
worship
of
the
great
being
and
the
necessity
of
being
just
and
charitable
is
otherwise
nothing
but
a
rehash
of
judaism
and
a
tedious
collection
of
fairy
tales
if
the
archangel
gabriel
had
brought
the
leaves
of
the
koran
to
mahomet
from
some
planet
all
arabia
would
have
seen
gabriel
come
down
nobody
saw
him
therefore
mahomet
was
a
brazen
impostor
who
deceived
imbeciles
hardly
had
he
pronounced
these
words
than
he
was
impaled
nevertheless
he
had
always
been
right
and
had
always
had
reason
on
his
side
i
meditated
last
night
i
was
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
nature
i
admired
the
immensity
the
course
the
harmony
of
these
infinite
globes
which
the
vulgar
do
not
know
how
to
admire
i
admired
still
more
the
intelligence
which
directs
these
vast
forces
i
said
to
myself
one
must
be
blind
not
to
be
dazzled
by
this
spectacle
one
must
be
stupid
not
to
recognize
the
author
of
it
one
must
be
mad
not
to
worship
him
what
tribute
of
worship
should
i
render
him
should
not
this
tribute
be
the
same
in
the
whole
of
space
since
it
is
the
same
supreme
power
which
reigns
equally
in
all
space
should
not
a
thinking
being
who
dwells
in
a
star
in
the
milky
way
offer
him
the
same
homage
as
the
thinking
being
on
this
little
globe
where
we
are
light
is
uniform
for
the
star
sirius
and
for
us
moral
philosophy
must
be
uniform
if
a
sentient
thinking
animal
in
sirius
is
born
of
a
tender
father
and
mother
who
have
been
occupied
with
his
happiness
he
owes
them
as
much
love
and
care
as
we
owe
to
our
parents
if
someone
in
the
milky
way
sees
a
needy
cripple
if
he
can
relieve
him
and
if
he
does
not
do
it
he
is
guilty
toward
all
globes
everywhere
the
heart
has
the
same
duties
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
of
god
if
he
has
a
throne
and
in
the
depth
of
the
abyss
if
he
is
an
abyss
i
was
plunged
in
these
ideas
when
one
of
those
genii
who
fill
the
intermundane
spaces
came
down
to
me
i
recognized
this
same
aerial
creature
who
had
appeared
to
me
on
another
occasion
to
teach
me
how
different
god
judgments
were
from
our
own
and
how
a
good
action
is
preferable
to
a
controversy
he
transported
me
into
a
desert
all
covered
with
piled
up
bones
and
between
these
heaps
of
dead
men
there
were
walks
of
trees
and
at
the
end
of
each
walk
a
tall
man
of
august
mien
who
regarded
these
sad
remains
with
pity
alas
my
archangel
said
i
where
have
you
brought
me
to
desolation
he
answered
and
who
are
these
fine
patriarchs
whom
i
see
sad
and
motionless
at
the
end
of
these
green
walks
they
seem
to
be
weeping
over
this
countless
crowd
of
dead
you
shall
know
poor
human
creature
answered
the
genius
from
the
intermundane
spaces
but
first
of
all
you
must
weep
he
began
with
the
first
pile
these
he
said
are
the
thousand
jews
who
danced
before
a
calf
with
the
thousand
who
were
killed
while
lying
with
midianitish
women
the
number
of
those
massacred
for
such
errors
and
offences
amounts
to
nearly
three
hundred
thousand
in
the
other
walks
are
the
bones
of
the
christians
slaughtered
by
each
other
for
metaphysical
disputes
they
are
divided
into
several
heaps
of
four
centuries
each
one
heap
would
have
mounted
right
to
the
sky
they
had
to
be
divided
what
i
cried
brothers
have
treated
their
brothers
like
this
and
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
of
this
brotherhood
here
said
the
spirit
are
the
twelve
million
americans
killed
in
their
fatherland
because
they
had
not
been
baptized
my
god
why
did
you
not
leave
these
frightful
bones
to
dry
in
the
hemisphere
where
their
bodies
were
born
and
where
they
were
consigned
to
so
many
different
deaths
why
assemble
here
all
these
abominable
monuments
to
barbarism
and
fanaticism
to
instruct
you
since
you
wish
to
instruct
me
i
said
to
the
genius
tell
me
if
there
have
been
peoples
other
than
the
christians
and
the
jews
in
whom
zeal
and
religion
wretchedly
transformed
into
fanaticism
have
inspired
so
many
horrible
cruelties
yes
he
said
the
mohammedans
were
sullied
with
the
same
inhumanities
but
rarely
and
when
one
asked
pity
of
them
and
offered
them
tribute
they
pardoned
as
for
the
other
nations
there
has
not
been
one
right
from
the
existence
of
the
world
which
has
ever
made
a
purely
religious
war
follow
me
now
i
followed
him
a
little
beyond
these
piles
of
dead
men
we
found
other
piles
they
were
composed
of
sacks
of
gold
and
silver
and
each
had
its
label
of
the
heretics
massacred
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
seventeenth
and
the
and
so
on
in
going
back
and
silver
of
americans
etc
and
all
these
piles
were
surmounted
with
crosses
mitres
croziers
triple
crowns
studded
with
precious
stones
what
my
genius
it
was
then
to
have
these
riches
that
these
dead
were
piled
up
yes
my
son
i
wept
and
when
by
my
grief
i
had
merited
to
be
led
to
the
end
of
the
green
walks
he
led
me
there
contemplate
he
said
the
heroes
of
humanity
who
were
the
benefactors
and
who
were
all
united
in
banishing
from
the
world
as
far
as
they
were
able
violence
and
rapine
question
them
i
ran
to
the
first
of
the
band
he
had
a
crown
on
his
head
and
a
little
censer
in
his
hand
i
humbly
asked
him
his
name
i
am
numa
pompilius
he
said
to
me
i
succeeded
a
brigand
and
i
had
brigands
to
govern
i
taught
them
virtue
and
the
worship
of
god
after
me
they
forgot
both
more
than
once
i
forbade
that
in
the
temples
there
should
be
any
image
because
the
deity
which
animates
nature
can
not
be
represented
during
my
reign
the
romans
had
neither
wars
nor
seditions
and
my
religion
did
nothing
but
good
all
the
neighbouring
peoples
came
to
honour
me
at
my
funeral
that
happened
to
no
one
but
me
i
kissed
his
hand
and
i
went
to
the
second
he
was
a
fine
old
man
about
a
hundred
years
old
clad
in
a
white
robe
he
put
his
on
his
mouth
and
with
the
other
hand
he
cast
some
beans
behind
him
i
recognized
pythagoras
he
assured
me
he
had
never
had
a
golden
thigh
and
that
he
had
never
been
a
cock
but
that
he
had
governed
the
crotoniates
with
as
much
justice
as
numa
governed
the
romans
almost
at
the
same
time
and
that
this
justice
was
the
rarest
and
most
necessary
thing
in
the
world
i
learned
that
the
pythagoreans
examined
their
consciences
twice
a
day
the
honest
people
how
far
we
are
from
them
but
we
who
have
been
nothing
but
assassins
for
thirteen
hundred
years
we
say
that
these
wise
men
were
arrogant
in
order
to
please
pythagoras
i
did
not
say
a
word
to
him
and
i
passed
to
zarathustra
who
was
occupied
in
concentrating
the
celestial
fire
in
the
focus
of
a
concave
mirror
in
the
middle
of
a
hall
with
a
hundred
doors
which
all
led
to
wisdom
zarathustra
precepts
are
called
and
are
a
hundred
in
number
over
the
principal
door
i
read
these
words
which
are
the
précis
of
all
moral
philosophy
and
which
cut
short
all
the
disputes
of
the
casuists
when
in
doubt
if
an
action
is
good
or
bad
refrain
certainly
i
said
to
my
genius
the
barbarians
who
immolated
all
these
victims
had
never
read
these
beautiful
words
we
then
saw
the
zaleucus
the
thales
the
aniximanders
and
all
the
sages
who
had
sought
truth
and
practised
virtue
when
we
came
to
socrates
i
recognized
him
very
quickly
by
his
flat
nose
well
i
said
to
him
here
you
are
then
among
the
number
of
the
almighty
confidants
all
the
inhabitants
of
europe
except
the
turks
and
the
tartars
of
the
crimea
who
know
nothing
pronounce
your
name
with
respect
it
is
revered
loved
this
great
name
to
the
point
that
people
have
wanted
to
know
those
of
your
persecutors
melitus
and
anitus
are
known
because
of
you
just
as
ravaillac
is
known
because
of
henry
iv
but
i
know
only
this
name
of
anitus
i
do
not
know
precisely
who
was
the
scoundrel
who
calumniated
you
and
who
succeeded
in
having
you
condemned
to
take
hemlock
since
my
adventure
replied
socrates
i
have
never
thought
about
that
man
but
seeing
that
you
make
me
remember
it
i
have
much
pity
for
him
he
was
a
wicked
priest
who
secretly
conducted
a
business
in
hides
a
trade
reputed
shameful
among
us
he
sent
his
two
children
to
my
school
the
other
disciples
taunted
them
with
having
a
father
who
was
a
currier
they
were
obliged
to
leave
the
irritated
father
had
no
rest
until
he
had
stirred
up
all
the
priests
and
all
the
sophists
against
me
they
persuaded
the
counsel
of
the
five
hundred
that
i
was
an
impious
fellow
who
did
not
believe
that
the
moon
mercury
and
mars
were
gods
indeed
i
used
to
think
as
i
think
now
that
there
is
only
one
god
master
of
all
nature
the
judges
handed
me
over
to
the
poisoner
of
the
republic
he
cut
short
my
life
by
a
few
days
i
died
peacefully
at
the
age
of
seventy
and
since
that
time
i
pass
a
happy
life
with
all
these
great
men
whom
you
see
and
of
whom
i
am
the
least
after
enjoying
some
time
in
conversation
with
socrates
i
went
forward
with
my
guide
into
a
grove
situated
above
the
thickets
where
all
the
sages
of
antiquity
seemed
to
be
tasting
sweet
repose
i
saw
a
man
of
gentle
simple
countenance
who
seemed
to
me
to
be
about
years
old
from
afar
he
cast
compassionate
glances
on
these
piles
of
whitened
bones
across
which
i
had
had
to
pass
to
reach
the
sages
abode
i
was
astonished
to
find
his
feet
swollen
and
bleeding
his
hands
likewise
his
side
pierced
and
his
ribs
flayed
with
whip
cuts
good
heavens
i
said
to
him
is
it
possible
for
a
just
man
a
sage
to
be
in
this
state
i
have
just
seen
one
who
was
treated
in
a
very
hateful
way
but
there
is
no
comparison
between
his
torture
and
yours
wicked
priests
and
wicked
judges
poisoned
him
is
it
by
priests
and
judges
that
you
have
been
so
cruelly
assassinated
he
answered
with
much
courtesy
and
who
were
these
monsters
were
ah
that
says
everything
i
understand
by
this
single
word
that
they
must
have
condemned
you
to
death
had
you
then
proved
to
them
as
socrates
did
that
the
moon
was
not
a
goddess
and
that
mercury
was
not
a
god
these
planets
were
not
in
question
my
compatriots
did
not
know
at
all
what
a
planet
is
they
were
all
arrant
ignoramuses
their
superstitions
were
quite
different
from
those
of
the
you
wanted
to
teach
them
a
new
religion
then
at
all
i
said
to
them
simply
god
with
all
your
heart
and
your
as
yourself
for
that
is
man
whole
duty
judge
if
this
precept
is
not
as
old
as
the
universe
judge
if
i
brought
them
a
new
religion
i
did
not
stop
telling
them
that
i
had
come
not
to
destroy
the
law
but
to
fulfil
it
i
had
observed
all
their
rites
circumcised
as
they
all
were
baptized
as
were
the
most
zealous
among
them
like
them
i
paid
the
corban
i
observed
the
passover
as
they
did
eating
standing
up
a
lamb
cooked
with
lettuces
i
and
my
friends
went
to
pray
in
the
temple
my
friends
even
frequented
this
temple
after
my
death
in
a
word
i
fulfilled
all
their
laws
without
a
single
what
these
wretches
could
not
even
reproach
you
with
swerving
from
their
laws
without
a
why
then
did
they
put
you
in
the
condition
in
which
i
now
see
you
do
you
expect
me
to
say
they
were
very
arrogant
and
selfish
they
saw
that
i
knew
them
they
knew
that
i
was
making
the
citizens
acquainted
with
them
they
were
the
stronger
they
took
away
my
life
and
people
like
them
will
always
do
as
much
if
they
can
to
whoever
does
them
too
much
but
did
you
say
nothing
do
nothing
that
could
serve
them
as
a
pretext
the
wicked
everything
serves
as
did
you
not
say
once
that
you
were
come
not
to
send
peace
but
a
sword
is
a
copyist
error
i
told
them
that
i
sent
peace
and
not
a
sword
i
have
never
written
anything
what
i
said
can
have
been
changed
without
evil
you
therefore
contributed
in
no
way
by
your
speeches
badly
reported
badly
interpreted
to
these
frightful
piles
of
bones
which
i
saw
on
my
road
in
coming
to
consult
you
is
with
horror
only
that
i
have
seen
those
who
have
made
themselves
guilty
of
these
and
these
monuments
of
power
and
wealth
of
pride
and
avarice
these
treasures
these
ornaments
these
signs
of
grandeur
which
i
have
seen
piled
up
on
the
road
while
i
was
seeking
wisdom
do
they
come
from
you
is
impossible
i
and
my
people
lived
in
poverty
and
meanness
my
grandeur
was
in
virtue
i
was
about
to
beg
him
to
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
just
who
he
was
my
guide
warned
me
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
he
told
me
that
i
was
not
made
to
understand
these
sublime
mysteries
only
did
i
conjure
him
to
tell
me
in
what
true
religion
consisted
i
not
already
told
you
love
god
and
your
as
what
if
one
loves
god
one
can
eat
meat
on
friday
always
ate
what
was
given
me
for
i
was
too
poor
to
give
anyone
in
loving
god
in
being
just
should
one
not
be
rather
cautious
not
to
confide
all
the
adventures
of
one
life
to
an
unknown
man
was
always
my
can
i
not
by
doing
good
dispense
with
making
a
pilgrimage
to
james
of
compostella
have
never
been
in
that
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
imprison
myself
in
a
retreat
with
fools
for
me
i
always
made
little
journeys
from
town
to
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
take
sides
either
for
the
greek
church
or
the
latin
i
was
in
the
world
i
never
made
any
difference
between
the
jew
and
the
well
if
that
is
so
i
take
you
for
my
only
master
then
he
made
me
a
sign
with
his
head
which
filled
me
with
consolation
the
vision
disappeared
and
a
clear
conscience
stayed
with
me
section
i
every
sect
in
whatever
sphere
is
the
of
doubt
and
error
scotist
thomist
realist
nominalist
papist
calvinist
molinist
jansenist
are
only
pseudonyms
there
are
no
sects
in
geometry
one
does
not
speak
of
a
euclidian
an
archimedean
when
the
truth
is
evident
it
is
impossible
for
parties
and
factions
to
arise
never
has
there
been
a
dispute
as
to
whether
there
is
daylight
at
noon
the
branch
of
astronomy
which
determines
the
course
of
the
stars
and
the
return
of
eclipses
being
once
known
there
is
no
more
dispute
among
astronomers
in
england
one
does
not
say
i
am
a
newtonian
a
lockian
a
halleyan
why
those
who
have
read
can
not
refuse
their
assent
to
the
truths
taught
by
these
three
great
men
the
more
newton
is
revered
the
less
do
people
style
themselves
newtonians
this
word
supposes
that
there
are
in
england
maybe
we
still
have
a
few
cartesians
in
france
that
is
solely
because
descartes
system
is
a
tissue
of
erroneous
and
ridiculous
imaginings
it
is
likewise
with
the
small
number
of
truths
of
fact
which
are
well
established
the
records
of
the
tower
of
london
having
been
authentically
gathered
by
rymer
there
are
no
rymerians
because
it
occurs
to
no
one
to
combat
this
collection
in
it
one
finds
neither
contradictions
absurdities
nor
prodigies
nothing
which
revolts
the
reason
nothing
consequently
which
sectarians
strive
to
maintain
or
upset
by
absurd
arguments
everyone
agrees
therefore
that
records
are
worthy
of
belief
you
are
mohammedan
therefore
there
are
people
who
are
not
therefore
you
might
well
be
wrong
what
would
be
the
true
religion
if
christianity
did
not
exist
the
religion
in
which
there
were
no
sects
the
religion
in
which
all
minds
were
necessarily
in
agreement
well
to
what
dogma
do
all
minds
agree
to
the
worship
of
a
god
and
to
integrity
all
the
philosophers
of
the
world
who
have
had
a
religion
have
said
in
all
time
there
is
a
god
and
one
must
be
just
there
then
is
the
universal
religion
established
in
all
time
and
throughout
mankind
the
point
in
which
they
all
agree
is
therefore
true
and
the
systems
through
which
they
differ
are
therefore
false
my
sect
is
the
best
says
a
brahmin
to
me
but
my
friend
if
your
sect
is
good
it
is
necessary
for
if
it
were
not
absolutely
necessary
you
would
admit
to
me
that
it
was
useless
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
it
is
for
all
men
how
then
can
it
be
that
all
men
have
not
what
is
absolutely
necessary
to
them
how
is
it
possible
for
the
rest
of
the
world
to
laugh
at
you
and
your
brahma
when
zarathustra
hermes
orpheus
minos
and
all
the
great
men
say
let
us
worship
god
and
let
us
be
just
nobody
laughs
but
everyone
hisses
the
man
who
claims
that
one
can
not
please
god
unless
when
one
dies
one
is
holding
a
cow
tail
and
the
man
who
wants
one
to
have
the
end
of
one
prepuce
cut
off
and
the
man
who
consecrates
crocodiles
and
onions
and
the
man
who
attaches
eternal
salvation
to
the
dead
bones
one
carries
under
one
shirt
or
to
a
plenary
indulgence
which
one
buys
at
rome
for
two
and
a
half
sous
whence
comes
this
universal
competition
in
hisses
and
derision
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
it
is
clear
that
the
things
at
which
everyone
sneers
are
not
of
a
very
evident
truth
what
shall
we
say
of
one
of
sejan
secretaries
who
dedicated
to
petronius
a
bombastic
book
entitled
the
truths
of
the
sibylline
oracles
proved
by
the
facts
this
secretary
proves
to
you
first
that
it
was
necessary
for
god
to
send
on
earth
several
sibyls
one
after
the
other
for
he
had
no
other
means
of
teaching
mankind
it
is
demonstrated
that
god
spoke
to
these
sibyls
for
the
word
signifies
they
had
to
live
a
long
time
for
it
is
the
very
least
that
persons
to
whom
god
speaks
should
have
this
privilege
they
were
twelve
in
number
for
this
number
is
sacred
they
had
certainly
predicted
all
the
events
in
the
world
for
tarquinius
superbus
bought
three
of
their
books
from
an
old
woman
for
a
hundred
crowns
what
incredulous
fellow
adds
the
secretary
will
dare
deny
all
these
evident
facts
which
happened
in
a
corner
before
the
whole
world
who
can
deny
the
fulfilment
of
their
prophecies
has
not
virgil
himself
quoted
the
predictions
of
the
sibyls
if
we
have
not
the
first
examples
of
the
sibylline
books
written
at
a
time
when
people
did
not
know
how
to
read
or
write
have
we
not
authentic
copies
impiety
must
be
silent
before
such
proofs
thus
did
houttevillus
speak
to
sejan
he
hoped
to
have
a
position
as
augur
which
would
be
worth
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
francs
and
he
had
nothing
what
my
sect
teaches
is
obscure
i
admit
it
says
a
fanatic
and
it
is
because
of
this
obscurity
that
it
must
be
believed
for
the
sect
itself
says
it
is
full
of
obscurities
my
sect
is
extravagant
therefore
it
is
divine
for
how
should
what
appears
so
mad
have
been
embraced
by
so
many
peoples
if
it
were
not
divine
it
is
precisely
like
the
alcoran
which
the
sonnites
say
has
an
angel
face
and
an
snout
be
not
scandalized
by
the
animal
snout
and
worship
the
face
thus
speaks
this
insensate
fellow
but
a
fanatic
of
another
sect
answers
it
is
you
who
are
the
animal
and
i
who
am
the
angel
well
who
shall
judge
the
suit
who
shall
decide
between
these
two
fanatics
the
reasonable
impartial
man
learned
in
a
knowledge
that
is
not
that
of
words
the
man
free
from
prejudice
and
lover
of
truth
and
justice
in
short
the
man
who
is
not
the
foolish
animal
and
who
does
not
think
he
is
the
angel
section
ii
and
are
synonymous
you
are
peripatetic
and
i
platonician
we
are
therefore
both
wrong
for
you
combat
plato
only
because
his
fantasies
have
revolted
you
and
i
am
alienated
from
aristotle
only
because
it
seems
to
me
that
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
if
one
or
the
other
had
demonstrated
the
truth
there
would
be
a
sect
no
longer
to
declare
oneself
for
the
opinion
of
the
one
or
the
other
is
to
take
sides
in
a
civil
war
there
are
no
sects
in
mathematics
in
experimental
physics
a
man
who
examines
the
relations
between
a
cone
and
a
sphere
is
not
of
the
sect
of
archimedes
he
who
sees
that
the
square
of
the
hypotenuse
of
a
triangle
is
equal
to
the
square
of
the
two
other
sides
is
not
of
the
sect
of
pythagoras
when
you
say
that
the
blood
circulates
that
the
air
is
heavy
that
the
sun
rays
are
pencils
of
seven
refrangible
rays
you
are
not
either
of
the
sect
of
harvey
or
the
sect
of
torricelli
or
the
sect
of
newton
you
agree
merely
with
the
truth
demonstrated
by
them
and
the
entire
universe
will
ever
be
of
your
opinion
this
is
the
character
of
truth
it
is
of
all
time
it
is
for
all
men
it
has
only
to
show
itself
to
be
recognized
one
can
not
argue
against
it
a
long
dispute
signifies
both
parties
are
wrong
footnotes
reference
to
the
abbé
houtteville
author
of
a
book
entitled
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
proved
by
the
facts
nicole
in
his
essais
de
morale
written
after
two
or
three
thousand
volumes
of
ethics
treatise
on
charity
chap
ii
says
that
by
means
of
the
wheels
and
gibbets
which
people
establish
in
common
are
repressed
the
tyrannous
thoughts
and
designs
of
each
individual
i
shall
not
examine
whether
people
have
gibbets
in
common
as
they
have
meadows
and
woods
in
common
and
a
common
purse
and
if
one
represses
ideas
with
wheels
but
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
nicole
should
take
highway
robbery
and
assassination
for
one
should
distinguish
shades
of
difference
a
little
better
the
man
who
said
that
nero
had
his
mother
assassinated
through
that
cartouche
had
much
would
not
be
expressing
himself
very
correctly
is
not
wickedness
it
is
a
sentiment
that
is
natural
to
all
men
it
is
much
nearer
vanity
than
crime
a
beggar
in
the
suburbs
of
madrid
nobly
begged
charity
a
says
to
him
are
you
not
ashamed
to
practise
this
infamous
calling
when
you
are
able
to
work
sir
answered
the
beggar
i
ask
for
money
not
advice
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
with
full
castillian
dignity
this
gentleman
was
a
proud
beggar
his
vanity
was
wounded
by
a
trifle
he
asked
charity
out
of
love
for
himself
and
could
not
tolerate
the
reprimand
out
of
further
love
for
himself
a
missionary
travelling
in
india
met
a
fakir
laden
with
chains
naked
as
a
monkey
lying
on
his
stomach
and
having
himself
whipped
for
the
sins
of
his
compatriots
the
indians
who
gave
him
a
few
farthings
what
said
one
of
the
answered

fakir

that
i
have
myself
flogged
in
this
world
in
order
to
return
it
in
another
when
you
will
be
horses
and
i
horseman
those
who
have
said
that
love
of
ourselves
is
the
basis
of
all
our
opinions
and
all
our
actions
have
therefore
been
quite
right
in
india
spain
and
all
the
habitable
world
and
as
one
does
not
write
to
prove
to
men
that
they
have
faces
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
to
them
that
they
have
is
the
instrument
of
our
conservation
it
resembles
the
instrument
of
the
perpetuity
of
the
species
it
is
necessary
it
is
dear
to
us
it
gives
us
pleasure
and
it
has
to
be
hidden
section
i
this
is
a
vague
indeterminate
term
which
expresses
an
unknown
principle
of
known
effects
that
we
feel
in
us
the
word
corresponds
to
the
latin
to
the
greek
to
the
term
of
which
all
nations
have
made
use
to
express
what
they
did
not
understand
any
better
than
we
do
in
the
proper
and
literal
sense
of
the
latin
and
the
languages
derived
from
latin
it
signifies
which
thus
people
have
spoken
of
the
soul
of
men
of
animals
sometimes
of
plants
to
signify
their
principal
of
vegetation
and
life
in
pronouncing
this
word
people
have
never
had
other
than
a
confused
idea
as
when
it
is
said
in
genesis
and
the
lord
god
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a
living
soul
and
the
soul
of
animals
is
in
the
blood
and
kill
not
my
soul
etc
thus
the
soul
was
generally
taken
for
the
origin
and
the
cause
of
life
for
life
itself
that
is
why
all
known
nations
long
imagined
that
everything
died
with
the
body
if
one
can
disentangle
anything
in
the
chaos
of
ancient
histories
it
seems
that
the
egyptians
at
least
were
the
first
to
distinguish
between
the
intelligence
and
the
soul
and
the
greeks
learned
from
them
to
distinguish
their
their
their
the
latins
following
their
example
distinguish
and
and
we
finally
have
also
had
our
and
our
but
is
that
which
is
the
principle
of
our
life
different
from
that
which
is
the
principle
of
our
thoughts
is
it
the
same
being
does
that
which
directs
us
and
gives
us
sensation
and
memory
resemble
that
which
is
in
animals
the
cause
of
digestion
and
the
cause
of
their
sensations
and
of
their
memory
there
is
the
eternal
object
of
the
disputes
of
mankind
i
say
eternal
object
for
not
having
any
first
notion
from
which
we
can
descend
in
this
examination
we
can
only
rest
for
ever
in
a
labyrinth
of
doubt
and
feeble
conjecture
we
have
not
the
smallest
step
where
we
may
place
a
foot
in
order
to
reach
the
most
superficial
knowledge
of
what
makes
us
live
and
of
what
makes
us
think
how
should
we
have
we
should
have
had
to
see
life
and
thought
enter
a
body
does
a
father
know
how
he
has
produced
his
son
does
a
mother
how
she
conceived
him
has
anyone
ever
been
able
to
divine
how
he
acts
how
he
wakes
how
he
sleeps
does
anyone
know
how
his
limbs
obey
his
will
has
anyone
discovered
by
what
art
ideas
are
marked
out
in
his
brain
and
issue
from
it
at
his
command
frail
automatons
moved
by
the
invisible
hand
which
directs
us
on
this
stage
of
the
world
which
of
us
has
been
able
to
detect
the
wire
which
guides
us
we
dare
question
whether
the
soul
is
spirit
or
matter
if
it
is
created
before
us
if
it
issues
from
at
our
birth
if
after
animating
us
for
one
day
on
earth
it
lives
after
us
into
eternity
these
questions
appear
sublime
what
are
they
questions
of
blind
men
saying
to

no

to

what
spirit

not
not

able
to
say
what
it

the
soul
is
matter
says
another

what
is
matter
we
know
merely
some
of
its
appearances
and
some
of
its
properties
and
not
one
of
these

not
one
of

seems
to
have

connection
with

thought
is
something
distinct

say
you
but
what
proof
of
it
have
you
is
it
because
matter
is
divisible

figurable
and

is
not

who
has
told
you
that
the

of

are

it

whether
this

whether

to

never
does

hear
them
dispute
about
this
word
such
is
not
the
case
with
philosophers
for
us
the
word
soul
signifies
generally
that
which
animates
our
ancestors
the
celts
gave
to
their
soul
the
name
of
from
which
the
english
and
the
german
and
probably
the
ancient
teutons
and
the
ancient
britons
had
no
quarrels
in
their
universities
over
this
expression
the
greeks
distinguished
three
sorts
of
souls
which
signified
the
sensitive
soul
the
soul
of
the
senses
and
that
is
why

child
of
aphrodite
had
so
much
passion

why
psyche
loved

tenderly

which
we
have
translated

finally
the

possessed
therefore
three
souls
without
having
the
least
notion
of
any
of
them
thomas
aquinas
summation
of
thomas
lyons
edition
admits
these
three
souls
as
a
peripatetic
and
distinguishes
each
of
these
three
souls
in
three
parts
was
in
the
breast
was
distributed
throughout
the
body
and
was
in
the
head
there
has
been
no
other
philosophy
in
our
schools
up
to
our
day
and
woe
betide
any
man
who
took
one
of
these
souls
for
the
other
in
this
chaos
of
ideas
there
was
nevertheless
a
foundation
men
had
noticed
that
in
their
passions
of
love
hate
anger
fear
their
internal
organs
were
stimulated
to
movement
the
liver
and
the
heart
were
the
seat
of
the
passions
if
one
thought
deeply
one
felt
a
strife
in
the
organs
of
the
head
therefore
the
intellectual
soul
was
in
the
head
without
respiration
no
vegetation
no
life
therefore
the
vegetative
soul
was
in
the
breast
which
receives
the
breath
of
air
when
men
saw
in
dreams
their
dead
relatives
or
friends
they
had
to
seek
what
had
appeared
to
them
it
was
not
the
body
which
had
been
consumed
on
a
funeral
pyre
or
swallowed
up
in
the
sea
and
eaten
by
the
fishes
it
was
however
something
so
they
maintained
for
they
had
seen
it
the
dead
man
had
spoken
the
dreamer
had
questioned
him
was
it
was
it
was
it
with
whom
one
had
conversed
in
the
dream
one
imagined
a
phantom
an
airy
figure
it
was
it
was
a
ghost
from
the
shades
a
little
soul
of
air
and
fire
very
unrestricted
which
wandered
i
know
not
where
eventually
when
one
wanted
to
sift
the
matter
it
became
a
constant
that
this
soul
was
corporeal
and
the
whole
of
antiquity
never
had
any
other
idea
at
last
came
plato
who
so
subtilized
this
soul
that
it
was
doubtful
if
he
did
not
separate
it
entirely
from
matter
but
that
was
a
problem
that
was
never
solved
until
faith
came
to
enlighten
us
in
vain
do
the
materialists
quote
some
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
who
did
not
express
themselves
with
precision
irenæus
says
liv
chaps
vi
and
vii
that
the
soul
is
only
the
breath
of
life
that
it
is
incorporeal
only
by
comparison
with
the
mortal
body
and
that
it
preserves
the
form
of
man
so
that
it
may
be
recognized
in
vain
does
tertullian
express
himself
like
this
the
corporeality
of
the
soul
shines
bright
in
the
gospel
animæ
in
ipso
evangelio
de
anima
cap
vii
for
if
the
soul
did
not
have
a
body
the
image
of
the
soul
would
not
have
the
image
of
the
body
in
vain
does
he
record
the
vision
of
a
holy
woman
who
had
seen
a
very
shining
soul
of
the
colour
of
air
in
vain
does
tatien
say
expressly
ad
c
xxiii
the
soul
of
man
is
composed
of
many
parts
in
vain
is
hilarius
quoted
as
saying
in
later
times
hilarius
on
matthew
there
is
nothing
created
which
is
not
corporeal
either
in
heaven
or
on
earth
or
among
the
visible
or
among
the
invisible
everything
is
formed
of
elements
and
souls
whether
they
inhabit
a
body
or
issue
from
it
have
always
a
corporeal
substance
in
vain
does
ambrose
in
the
sixth
century
say
on
abraham
liv
ch
viii
we
recognize
nothing
but
the
material
except
the
venerable
trinity
alone
the
body
of
the
entire
church
has
decided
that
the
soul
is
immaterial
these
saints
fell
into
an
error
at
that
time
universal
they
were
men
but
they
were
not
mistaken
over
immortality
because
that
is
clearly
announced
in
the
gospels
we
have
so
evident
a
need
of
the
decision
of
the
infallible
church
on
these
points
of
philosophy
that
we
have
not
indeed
by
ourselves
any
sufficient
notion
of
what
is
called
pure
spirit
and
of
what
is
named
matter
pure
spirit
is
an
expression
which
gives
us
no
idea
and
we
know
matter
only
by
a
few
phenomena
we
know
it
so
little
that
we
call
it
substance
well
the
word
substance
means
that
which
is
under
but
what
is
under
will
be
eternally
hidden
from
us
what
is
is
the
creator
secret
and
this
secret
of
the
creator
is
everywhere
we
do
not
know
either
how
we
receive
life
or
how
we
give
it
or
how
we
grow
or
how
we
digest
or
how
we
sleep
or
how
we
think
or
how
we
feel
the
great
difficulty
is
to
understand
how
a
being
whoever
he
be
has
thoughts

followed

scrupulously

jaquelot
teaches

nothing
he
sets
himself
also
against

because
the
modest
locke
said
liv
iv
ch
iii
para
vi
we
possibly
shall
never
be
able
to
know
whether
any
mere
material
being
thinks
or
no
it
being
impossible
for
us
by
the
contemplation
of
our
own
ideas
without
revelation
to
discover
whether
omnipotency
has
not
given
to
some
systems
of
matter
fitly
disposed
a
power
to
perceive
and
think
or
else
joined
and
fixed
to

so
disposed
a
thinking
immaterial
substance
it
being
in
respect
of
our
notions
not
much
more
remote
from
our
comprehension
to
conceive
that
god
can
if
he
pleases
superadd
to
matter
a
faculty
of
thinking
than
that
he
should
superadd
to
it
another
substance
with
a
faculty
of
thinking
since
we
know
not
wherein
thinking
consists
nor
to
what
sort
of
substances
the
almighty
has
been
pleased
to
give
that
power
which
can
not
be
in
any
created
being
but
merely
by
the
good
pleasure
and
bounty
of
the
creator
for
i
see
no
contradiction
in
it
that
the
first
eternal
thinking
being
should
if
he
pleased
give
to
certain
systems
of
created
senseless
matter
put
together
as
he
thinks
fit
some
degrees
of
sense
perception
and
thought
those
are
the
words
of
a
profound
religious
and
modest
man
we
know
what
quarrels
he
had
to
undergo
on
account
of
this
opinion
which
appeared
bold
but
which
was
in
fact
in
him
only
a
consequence
of
his
conviction
of
the
omnipotence
of
god
and
the
weakness
of
man
he
did
not
say
that
matter
thought
but
he
said
that
we
have
not
enough
knowledge
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
impossible
for
god
to
add
the
gift
of
thought
to
the
unknown
being
called
matter
after
according
it
the
gift
of
gravitation
and
the
gift
of
movement
both
of
which
are
equally
incomprehensible
locke
was
not
assuredly
the
only
one
who
had
advanced
this
opinion
it
was
the
opinion
of
all
antiquity
who
regarding
the
soul
as
very
unrestricted
matter
affirmed
consequently
that
matter
could
feel
and
think
it
was
gassendi
opinion
as
may
be
seen
in
his
objections
to
descartes
it
is
true
says
gassendi
that
you
know
what
you
think
but
you
are
ignorant
of
what
species
of
substance
you
are
you
who
think
thus
although
the
operation
of
thought
is
known
to
you
the
principle
of
your
essence
is
hidden
from
you
and
you
do
not
know
what
is
the
nature
of
this
substance
one
of
the
operations
of
which
is
to
think
you
are
like
a
blind
man
who
feeling
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
being
informed
that
it
is
caused
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
thinks
he
has
a
clear
and
distinct
idea
of
this
luminary
because
if
he
were
asked
what
the
sun
was
he
could
reply
that
it
is
a
thing
which
heats
etc
the
same
gassendi
in
his
epicurean
philosophy
repeats
several
times
that
there
is
no
mathematical
evidence
of
the
pure
spirituality
of
the
soul
descartes
in
one
of
his
letters
to
the
palatine
princess
elisabeth
says
to
her
i
confess
that
by
the
natural
reason
alone
we
can
make
many
conjectures
on
the
soul
and
have
gratifying
hopes
but
no
certainty
and
in
that
sentence
descartes
combats
in
his
letters
what
he
puts
forward
in
his
works
a
too
ordinary
contradiction
in
fine
we
have
seen
that
all
the
fathers
of
the
first
centuries
of
the
church
while
believing
the
soul
immortal
believed
it
at
the
same
time
material
they
thought
that
it
is
as
easy
for
god
to
conserve
as
to
create
they
said
god
made
the
soul
thinking
he
will
preserve
it
thinking
malebranche
has
proved
very
well
that
we
have
no
idea
by
ourselves
and
that
objects
are
incapable
of
giving
us
ideas
from
that
he
concludes
that
we
see
everything
in
god
that
is
at
the
bottom
the
same
thing
as
making
god
the
author
of
all
our
ideas
for
with
what
should
we
see
in
him
if
we
had
not
instruments
for
seeing
and
these
instruments
it
is
he
alone
who
holds
them
and
guides
them
this
system
is
a
labyrinth
one
lane
of
which
would
lead
you
to
spinozism
another
to
stoicism
another
to
chaos
when
one
has
had
a
good
argument
about
spirit
and
matter
one
always
finishes
by
not
understanding
each
other
no
philosopher
has
been
able
with
his
own
strength
to
lift
this
veil
stretched
by
nature
over
all
the

of
the
soul
of
animals
and
of
some
empty
ideas
before
the
strange
system
which
supposes
animals
to
be
pure
machines
without
any
sensation
men
had
never
thought
that
the
beasts
possessed
an
immaterial
soul
and
nobody
had
pushed
recklessness
to
the
point
of
saying
that
an
oyster
has
a
spiritual
soul
everyone
concurred
peaceably
in
agreeing
that
the
beasts
had
received
from
god
feeling
memory
ideas
and
no
pure
spirit
nobody
had
abused
the
gift
of
reason
to
the
point
of
saying
that
nature
had
given
the
beasts
all
the
organs
of
feeling
so
that
they
might
not
feel
anything
nobody
had
said
that
they
cry
when
they
are
wounded
and
that
they
fly
when
pursued
without
experiencing
pain
or
fear
at
that
time
people
did
not
deny
the
omnipotence
of
god
he
had
been
able
to
communicate
to
the
organized
matter
of
animals
pleasure
pain
remembrance
the
combination
of
a
few
ideas
he
had
been
able
to
give
to
several
of
them
such
as
the
monkey
the
elephant
the
the
talent
of
perfecting
themselves
in
the
arts
which
were
taught
to
them
not
only
had
he
been
able
to
endow
nearly
all
carnivorous
animals
with
the
talent
of
warring
better
in
their
experienced
old
age
than
in
their
too
trustful
youth
not
only
i
say
had
he
been
able
to
do
these
things
but
he
had
done
them
the
universe
bore
witness
thereto
pereira
and
descartes
maintained
that
the
universe
was
mistaken
that
god
was
a
juggler
that
he
had
given
animals
all
the
instruments
of
life
and
sensation
so
that
they
might
have
neither
life
nor
sensation
properly
speaking
but
i
do
not
know
what
philosophers
in
order
to
answer
descartes
chimera
leaped
into
the

they
gave

the
other
lodging
a
pure
spirit
in
a
bug
somebody
thought
of
a
middle
path
it
was
instinct
and
what
is
instinct
oh
oh
it
is
a
substantial
form
it
is
a
plastic
form
it
is
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
instinct
i
shall
be
of
your
opinion
so
long
as
you
will
call
the
majority
of
things
i
do
not
know
what
so
long
as
your
philosophy
begins
and
ends
with
i
do
not
know
what
i
shall
quote
prior
to
you
in
his
poem
on
the
vanity
of
the
world
the
author
of
the
article
soul
in
the
encyclopedia
explains
himself
like
this
i
picture
the
animals
soul
as
an
immaterial
and
intelligent
substance
but
of
what
species
it
must
it
seems
to
me
be
an
active
principle
which
has
sensations
and
which
has
only
that
if
we
reflect
on
the
nature
of
the
soul
of
animals
it
supplies
us
with
groundwork
which
might
lead
us
to
think
that
its
spirituality
will
save
it
from
annihilation
i
do
not
know
how
one
pictures
an
immaterial
substance
to
picture
something
is
to
make
an
image
of
it
and
up
till
now
nobody
has
been
able
to
paint
the
spirit
for
the
word
picture
i
want
the
author
to
understand
i
conceive
speaking
for
myself
i
confess
i
do
not
conceive
it
i
confess
still
less
that
a
spiritual
soul
may
be
annihilated
because
i
do
not
conceive
either
creation
or
because
i
have
never
been
present
at
god
council
because
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
the
principle
of
things
if
i
wish
to
prove
that
the
soul
is
a
real
being
someone
stops
me
by
telling
me
that
it
is
a
faculty
if
i
assert
that
it
is
a
faculty
and
that
i
have
the
faculty
of
thinking
i
am
told
that
i
am
mistaken
that
god
the
eternal
master
of
all
nature
does
everything
in
me
and
directs
all
my
actions
and
all
my
thoughts
that
if
i
produced
my
thoughts
i
should
know
the
thought
i
will
have
in
a
minute
that
i
never
know
it
that
i
am
only
an
automaton
with
sensations
and
ideas
necessarily
dependent
and
in
the
hands
of
the
supreme
being
infinitely
more
compliant
to
him
than
clay
is
to
the
potter
i
confess
my
ignorance
therefore
i
avow
that
four
thousand
tomes
of
metaphysics
will
not
teach
us
what
our
soul
is
an
orthodox
philosopher
said
to
a
heterodox
philosopher
how
have
you
been
able
to
come
to
the
point
of
imagining
that
the
soul
is
mortal
by
nature
and
eternal
only
by
the
pure
wish
of
god
by
my
own
experience
said
the
other
how
are
you
dead
yes
very
often
i
suffered
from
epilepsy
in
my
youth
and
i
assure
you
that
i
was
completely
dead
for
several
hours
no
sensation
no
remembrance
even
of
the
moment
that
i
fell
ill
the
same
thing
happens
to
me
now
nearly
every
night
i
never
feel
the
precise
moment
that
i
go
to
sleep
my
sleep
is
absolutely
dreamless
i
can
not
imagine
by
conjecture
how
long
i
have
slept
i
am
dead
regularly
six
hours
out
of
the
that
is
a
quarter
of
my
life
the
orthodox
then
asserted
that
he
always
thought
during
his
sleep
without
knowing
anything
about
it
the
heterodox
answered
him
i
believe
through
revelation
that
i
shall
always
think
in
the
other
life
but
i
assure
you
i
think
rarely
in
this
one
the
orthodox
was
not
mistaken
in
asserting
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
faith
and
reason
demonstrate
this
truth
but
he
might
be
mistaken
in
asserting
that
a
sleeping
man
always
thinks
locke
admitted
frankly
that
he
did
not
always
think
while
he
was
asleep
another
philosopher
has
said
thought
is
characteristic
of
man
but
it
is
not
his
essence
let
us
leave
to
each
man
the
liberty
and
consolation
of
seeking
himself
and
of
losing
himself
in
his
ideas
it
is
good
however
to
know
that
in
a
philosopher
suffered
a
severe
enough
persecution
for
having
confessed
with
locke
that
his
understanding
was
not
exercised
at
every
moment
of
the
day
and
night
just
as
he
did
not
use
his
arms
and
his
legs
at
all
moments
not
only
did
court
ignorance
persecute
him
but
the
malignant
influence
of
a
few
men
of
letters
was
let
loose
against
him
what
in
england
had
produced
merely
a
few
philosophical
disputes
produced
in
france
the
most
cowardly
atrocities
a
frenchman
suffered
by
locke
there
have
always
been
in
the
mud
of
our
literature
more
than
one
of
these
miscreants
who
have
sold
their
pens
and
intrigued
against
their
benefactors
even
this
remark
is
rather
foreign
to
the
article
soul
but
should
one
miss
an
opportunity
of
dismaying
those
who
make
themselves
unworthy
of
the
name
of
men
of
letters
who
prostitute
the
little
mind
and
conscience
they
have
to
a
vile
to
a
fantastic
policy
who
betray
their
friends
to
flatter
fools
who
in
secret
powder
the
hemlock
which
the
powerful
and
malicious
ignoramus
wants
to
make
useful
citizens
drink
in
short
while
we
worship
god
with
all
our
soul
let
us
confess
always
our
profound
ignorance
of
this
soul
of
this
faculty
of
feeling
and
thinking
which
we
possess
from
his
infinite
goodness
let
us
avow
that
our
feeble
reasonings
can
take
nothing
away
from
or
add
anything
to
revelation
and
faith
let
us
conclude
in
fine
that
we
should
use
this
intelligence
the
nature
of
which
is
unknown
for
perfecting
the
sciences
which
are
the
object
of
the
encyclopedia
just
as
watchmakers
use
springs
in
their
watches
without
knowing
what
a
spring
is
section
iv
about
the
soul
and
about
our
little
knowledge
on
the
testimony
of
our
acquired
knowledge
we
have
dared
question
whether
the
soul
is
created
before
us
whether
it
comes
from
into
our
body
at
what
age
it
came
to
settle
between
a
bladder
and
the
intestines
and
if
it
brought
ideas
with
it
or
received
them
there
and
what
are
these
ideas
if
after
animating
us
for
a
few
moments
its
essence
is
to
live
after
us
into
eternity
without
the
intervention
of
god
himself
if
being
spirit
and
god
being
spirit
they
are
both
of
like
nature
these
questions
seem
sublime
what
are
they
questions
about
light
by
men
born
blind
what
have
all
the
philosophers
ancient
and
modern
taught
us
a
child
is
wiser
than
they
are
he
does
not
think
about
things
of
which
he
can
form
no
conception
you
will
say
that
it
is
sad
for
our
insatiable
curiosity
for
our
inexhaustible
thirst
for
happiness
to
be
thus
ignorant
of
ourselves
i
agree
and
there
are
still
sadder
things
but
i
shall
answer
you
tua
mortalis
non
est
mortale
quod
ovid
met
ii
you
have
a
man
fate
and
a
god
desires
once
again
it
seems
that
the
nature
of
every
principle
of
things
is
the
creator
secret
how
does
the
air
carry
sound
how
are
animals
formed
how
do
some
of
our
limbs
constantly
obey
our
wills
what
hand
puts
ideas
in
our
memory
keeps
them
there
as
in
a
register
and
pulls
them
out
sometimes
when
we
want
them
and
sometimes
in
spite
of
ourselves
our
nature
the
nature
of
the
universe
the
nature
of
the
least
plant
everything
for
us
is
sunk
in
a
shadowy
pit
man
is
an
acting
feeling
thinking
being
that
is
all
we
know
of
him
it
is
not
given
to
us
to
know
what
makes
us
feel
and
think
or
what
makes
us
act
or
what
makes
us
exist
the
acting
faculty
is
as
incomprehensible
for
us
as
the
thinking
faculty
the
difficulty
is
less
to
conceive
how
a
body
of
mud
has
feelings
and
ideas
than
to
conceive
how
a
being
whatever
it
be
has
ideas
and
feelings
here
on
one
side
the
soul
of
archimedes
on
the
other
the
soul
of
an
idiot
are
they
of
the
same
nature
if
their
essence
is
to
think
they
think
always
and
independently
of
the
body
which
can
not
act
without
them
if
they
think
by
their
own
nature
can
the
species
of
a
soul
which
can
not
do
a
sum
in
arithmetic
be
the
same
as
that
which
measured
the
heavens
if
it
is
the
organs
of
the
body
which
made
archimedes
think
why
is
it
that
my
idiot
who
has
a
stronger
constitution
than
archimedes
who
is
more
vigorous
digests
better
and
performs
all
his
functions
better
does
not
think
at
all
it
is
you
say
because
his
brain
is
not
so
good
but
you
are
making
a
supposition
you
do
not
know
at
all
no
difference
has
ever
been
found
between
healthy
brains
that
have
been
dissected
it
is
even
very
probable
that
a
fool
cerebellum
will
be
in
better
condition
than
archimedes
which
has
worked
prodigiously
and
which
might
be
worn
out
and
shrivelled
let
us
conclude
therefore
what
we
have
already
concluded
that
we
are
ignoramuses
about
all
first
principles
as
regards
ignoramuses
who
pride
themselves
on
their

they
are

section
v
of
warburton
paradox
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
warburton
editor
and
commentator
of
shakespeare
and
bishop
of
gloucester
making
use
of
english
freedom
and
abuse
of
the
custom
of
hurling
insults
at
one
adversaries
has
composed
four
volumes
to
prove
that
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
never
announced
in
the
pentateuch
and
to
conclude
from
this
same
proof
that
moses
mission
is
divine
here
is
the
précis
of
his
book
which
he
himself
gives
pages
and
of
the
first
volume
the
doctrine
of
a
life
to
come
of
rewards
and
punishments
after
death
is
necessary
to
all
civil
society
the
whole
human
race
this
is
where
he
is
and
especially
the
wisest
and
most
learned
nations
of
antiquity
concurred
in
believing
and
teaching
this
doctrine
it
can
not
be
found
in
any
passage
of
the
law
of
moses
therefore
the
law
of
moses
is
of
divine
origin
which
i
am
going
to
prove
by
the
two
following
syllogisms
every
religion
every
society
that
has
not
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
its
basis
can
be
maintained
only
by
an
extraordinary
providence
the
jewish
religion
had
not
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
basis
therefore
the
jewish
religion
was
maintained
by
an
extraordinary
providence
all
the
ancient
legislators
have
said
that
a
religion
which
did
not
teach
the
immortality
of
the
soul
could
not
be
maintained
but
by
an
extraordinary
providence
moses
founded
a
religion
which
is
not
founded
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
therefore
moses
believed
his
religion
maintained
by
an
extraordinary
providence
what
is
much
more
extraordinary
is
this
assertion
of
warburton
which
he
has
put
in
big
letters
at
the
beginning
of
his
book
he
has
often
been
reproached
with
the
extreme
rashness
and
bad
faith
with
which
he
dares
to
say
that
all
the
ancient
legislators
believed
that
a
religion
which
is
not
founded
on
pains
and
recompenses
after
death
can
be
maintained
only
by
an
extraordinary
providence
not
one
of
them
ever
said
it
he
does
not
undertake
even
to
give
any
example
in
his
huge
book
stuffed
with
a
vast
number
of
quotations
all
of
which
are
foreign
to
his
subject
he
has
buried
himself
beneath
a
pile
of
greek
and
latin
authors
ancient
and
modern
for
fear
one
might
see
through
him
on
the
other
side
of
a
horrible
multitude
of
envelopes
when
criticism
finally
probed
to
the
bottom
he
was
resurrected
from
among
all
these
dead
men
in
order
to
load
all
his
adversaries
with
insults
it
is
true
that
towards
the
end
of
his
fourth
volume
after
having
walked
through
a
hundred
labyrinths
and
having
fought
with
everybody
he
met
on
the
road
he
comes
at
last
to
his
great
question
which
he
had
left
there
he
lays
all
the
blame
on
the
book
of
job
which
passes
among
scholars
for
an
arab
work
and
he
tries
to
prove
that
job
did
not
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
later
he
explains
in
his
own
way
all
the
texts
of
holy
writ
by
which
people
have
tried
to
combat
this
opinion
all
one
can
say
about
it
is
that
if
he
was
right
it
was
not
for
a
bishop
to
be
right
in
such
a
way
he
should
have
felt
that
one
might
draw
dangerous
inferences
but
everything
in
this
world
is
a
mass
of
contradiction
this
man
who
became
accuser
and
persecutor
was
not
made
bishop
by
a
minister
of
state
patronage
until
immediately
after
he
had
written
his
book
at
salamanca
coimbre
or
rome
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
recant
and
to
ask
pardon
in
england
he
became
a
peer
of
the
realm
with
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
it
was
enough
to
modify
his
methods
section
vi
of
the
need
of
revelation
the
greatest
benefit
we
owe
to
the
new
testament
is
that
it
has
revealed
to
us
the
immortality
of
the
soul
it
is
in
vain
therefore
that
this
fellow
warburton
tried
to
cloud
over
this
important
truth
by
continually
representing
in
his
legation
of
moses
that
the
ancient
jews
knew
nothing
of
this
necessary
dogma
and
that
the
sadducees
did
not
admit
it
in
the
time
of
our
lord
jesus
he
interprets
in
his
own
way
the
very
words
that
have
been
put
into
jesus
christ
mouth
have
ye
not
read
that
which
was
spoken
unto
you
by
god
saying
i
am
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
matt
xxii
he
gives
to
the
parable
of
the
wicked
rich
man
a
sense
contrary
to
that
of
all
the
churches
sherlock
bishop
of
london
and
twenty
other
scholars
refuted
him
english
philosophers
even
reproached
him
with
the
scandal
of
an
anglican
bishop
manifesting
an
opinion
so
contrary
to
the
anglican
church
and
after
that
this
man
takes
it
into
his
head
to
treat
these
persons
as
impious
like
the
character
of
in
the
comedy
of
the
de
who
after
throwing
the
furniture
out
of
the
window
sees
a
man
carrying
some
of
it
off
and
cries
with
all
his
might
stop
thief
one
should
bless
the
revelation
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
of
rewards
and
punishments
after
death
all
the
more
that
mankind
vain
philosophy
has
always
been
sceptical
of
it
the
great
cæsar
did
not
believe
in
it
at
all
he
made
himself
quite
clear
in
full
senate
when
in
order
to
stop
catalina
being
put
to
death
he
represented
that
death
left
man
without
sensation
that
everything
died
with
him
and
nobody
refuted
this
view
the
roman
empire
was
divided
between
two
principal
sects
that
of
epicurus
which
asserted
that
deity
was
useless
to
the
world
and
that
the
soul
perished
with
the
body
and
that
of
the
stoics
who
regarded
the
soul
as
part
of
the
deity
which
after
death
was
joined
again
to
its
origin
to
the
great
everything
from
which
it
emanated
thus
whether
one
believed
the
soul
mortal
or
whether
one
believed
it
immortal
all
the
sects
were
agreed
in
laughing
at
pains
and
punishments
after
death
we
still
have
a
hundred
monuments
of
this
belief
of
the
romans
it
is
by
virtue
of
this
opinion
graved
profoundly
in
their
hearts
that
so
many
simple
roman
citizens
killed
themselves
without
the
least
scruple
they
did
not
wait
for
a
tyrant
to
hand
them
over
to
the
executioners
the
most
virtuous
men
even
and
those
most
persuaded
of
the
existence
of
a
god
hoped
for
no
reward
and
feared
no
punishment
clement
who
later
was
pope
and
saint
began
by
himself
doubting
what
the
early
christians
said
of
another
life
and
consulted
peter
at
cæsarea
we
are
far
from
believing
that
clement
wrote
the
history
that
is
attributed
to
him
but
this
history
makes
evident
the
need
the
human
race
had
of
a
precise
revelation
all
that
can
surprise
us
is
that
so
repressive
and
salutary
a
doctrine
has
left
a
prey
to
so
many
horrible
crimes
men
who
have
so
little
time
to
live
and
who
see
themselves
squeezed
between
two
eternities
section
vii
souls
of
fools
and
monsters
a
deformed
child
is
born
absolutely
imbecile
it
has
no
ideas
and
lives
without
ideas
we
have
seen
examples
of
this
how
shall
this
animal
be
defined
doctors
have
said
that
it
is
something
between
man
and
beast
others
have
said
that
it
had
a
sensitive
soul
but
not
an
intellectual
soul
it
eats
drinks
sleeps
wakes
has
sensations
but
it
does
not
think
is
there
another
life
for
this
creature
or
is
there
none
the
question
has
been
posed
and
has
not
yet
been
completely
answered
some
say
that
this
creature
must
have
a
soul
because
its
father
and
mother
had
one
but
by
this
reasoning
one
would
prove
that
if
it
came
into
the
world
without
a
nose
it
would
be
deemed
to
have
one
because
its
father
and
its
mother
had
noses
a
woman
gives
birth
to
child
with
no
chin
its
forehead
is
receding
and
rather
black
its
nose
is
slim
and
pointed
its
eyes
are
round
it
bears
not
a
bad
resemblance
to
a
swallow
the
rest
of
its
body
nevertheless
is
made
like
ours
the
parents
have
it
baptised
by
a
plurality
of
votes
it
is
considered
a
man
and
possessor
of
an
immortal
soul
but
if
this
ridiculous
little
figure
has
pointed
nails
and
mouth
it
is
declared
a
monster
it
has
no
soul
and
is
not
baptised
it
is
well
known
that
in
london
in
there
was
a
woman
who
gave
birth
every
week
to
a
rabbit
no
difficulty
was
made
about
refusing
baptism
to
this
child
despite
the
epidemic
mania
there
was
for
three
weeks
in
london
for
believing
that
this
poor
rogue
was
making
wild
rabbits
the
surgeon
who
attended
her
andré
by
name
swore
that
nothing
was
more
true
and
people
believed
him
but
what
reason
did
the
credulous
have
for
refusing
a
soul
to
this
woman
children
she
had
a
soul
her
children
should
be
provided
with
souls
also
whether
they
had
hands
whether
they
had
paws
whether
they
were
born
with
a
little
snout
or
with
a
face
can
not
the
supreme
being
bestow
the
gift
of
thought
and
sensation
on
a
little
i
know
not
what
born
of
a
woman
shaped
like
a
rabbit
as
well
as
to
a
little
i
know
not
what
shaped
like
a
man
shall
the
soul
that
was
ready
to
lodge
in
this
woman
foetus

into

locke
makes
the
sound
observation
about
monsters
that
one
must
not
attribute
immortality
to
the
exterior
of
a
body
that
the
form
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
immortality
he
says
is
no
more
attached
to
the
form
of
his
face
or
his
chest
than
to
the
way
his
beard
is
dressed
or
his
coat
cut
he
asks
what
is
the
exact
measure
of
deformity
by
which
you
can
recognize
whether
or
no
a
child
has
a
soul
what
is
the
precise
degree
at
which
it
must
be
declared
a
monster
and
deprived
of
a
soul
one
asks
still
further
what
would
be
a
soul
which
never
has
any
but
fantastic
ideas
there
are
some
which
never
escape
from
them
are
they
worthy
or
unworthy
what
is
to
be
done
with
their
pure
spirit
what
is
one
to
think
of
a
child
with
two
heads
without
deformity
apart
from
this
some
say
that
it
has
two
souls
because
it
is
provided
with
two
pineal
glands
with
two
with
two
others
reply
that
one
can
not
have
two
souls
when
one
has
only
one
chest
and
one
navel
in
fine
so
many
questions
have
been
asked
about
this
poor
human
soul
that
if
it
were
necessary
to
answer
them
all
this
examination
of
its
own
person
would
cause
it
the
most
intolerable
boredom
there
would
happen
to
it
what
happened
to
cardinal
de
polignac
at
a
conclave
his
steward
tired
of
never
being
able
to
make
him
settle
his
accounts
made
the
journey
from
rome
and
came
to
the
little
window
of
his
cell
burdened
with
an
immense
bundle
of
papers
he
read
for
nearly
two
hours
at
last
seeing
that
no
reply
was
forthcoming
he
put
his
head
forward
the
cardinal
had
departed
nearly
two
hours
before
our
souls
will
depart
before
their
stewards
have
acquainted
them
with
the
facts
but
let
us
be
exact
before
god
whatever
sort
of
ignoramuses
we
are

voltaire
himself
the
chevalier
learned
astronomer
has
carefully
observed
a
lizard
for
several
days
and
he
has
assured
himself
that
the
lizard
had
two
independent
wills
each
of
which
had
an
almost
equal
power
over
the
body
when
the
lizard
was
given
a
piece
of
bread
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
see
it
with
only
one
head
this
head
wanted
to
go
after
the
bread
and
the
other
wanted
the
body
to
remain
at
rest
the
ins
and
outs
of
all
governments
have
been
closely
examined
recently
tell
me
then
you
who
have
travelled
in
what
state
under
what
sort
of
government
you
would
choose
to
be
born
i
imagine
that
a
great
lord
in
france
would
not
be
vexed
to
be
born
in
germany
he
would
be
sovereign
instead
of
subject
a
peer
of
france
would
be
very
glad
to
have
the
privileges
of
the
english
peerage
he
would
be
legislator
the
lawyer
and
the
financier
would
be
better
off
in
france
than
elsewhere
but
what
country
would
a
wise
free
man
a
man
with
a
moderate
fortune
and
without
prejudices
choose
a
member
of
the
government
of
pondicherry
a
learned
man
enough
returned
to
europe
by
land
with
a
brahmin
better
educated
than
the
ordinary
brahmin
what
do
you
think
of
the
government
of
the
great
mogul
asked
the
councillor
i
think
it
abominable
answered
the
brahmin
how
can
you
expect
a
state
to
be
happily
governed
by
the
tartars
our
rajahs
our
omrahs
our
nabobs
are
very
content
but
the
citizens
are
hardly
so
and
millions
of
citizens
are
something
reasoning
the
councillor
and
the
brahmin
traversed
the
whole
of
upper
asia
i
make
the
observation
said
the
brahmin
that
there
is
not
one
republic
in
all
this
vast
part
of
the
world
formerly
there
was
the
republic
of
tyre
said
the
councillor
but
it
did
not
last
long
there
was
still
another
one
in
the
direction
of
arabia
petrea
in
a
little
corner
called
palestine
if
one
can
honour
with
the
name
of
republic
a
horde
of
thieves
and
usurers
sometimes
governed
by
judges
sometimes
by
a
species
of
kings
sometimes
by
become
slave
seven
or
eight
times
and
finally
driven
out
of
the
country
which
it
had
usurped
i
imagine
said
the
brahmin
that
one
ought
to
find
very
few
republics
on
the
earth
men
are
rarely
worthy
of
governing
themselves
this
happiness
should
belong
only
to
little
peoples
who
hide
themselves
in
islands
or
among
the
mountains
like
rabbits
who
shun
carnivorous
beasts
but
in
the
long
run
they
are
discovered
and
devoured
when
the
two
travellers
reached
asia
minor
the
councillor
said
to
the
brahmin
would
you
believe
that
a
republic
was
formed
in
a
corner
of
italy
which
lasted
more
than
five
hundred
years
and
which
owned
asia
minor
asia
africa
greece
gaul
spain
and
the
whole
of
italy
she
soon
became
a
monarchy
then
said
the
brahmin
you
have
guessed
right
said
the
other
but
this
monarchy
fell
and
every
day
we
compose
beautiful
dissertations
in
order
to
find
the
cause
of
its
decadence
and
downfall
you
take
a
deal
of
trouble
said
the
indian
this
empire
fell
because
it
existed
everything
has
to
fall
i
hope
as
much
will
happen
to
the
grand
mogul
empire
by
the
way
said
the
european
do
you
consider
that
there
should
be
more
honour
in
a
despotic
state
and
more
virtue
in
a
republic
the
indian
having
had
explained
to
him
what
we
mean
by
honour
answered
that
honour
was
more
necessary
in
a
republic
and
that
one
had
more
need
of
virtue
in
a
monarchical
state
for
said
he
a
man
who
claims
to
be
elected
by
the
people
will
not
be
if
he
is
dishonoured
whereas
at
the
court
he
could
easily
obtain
a
place
in
accordance
with
a
great
prince
maxim
that
in
order
to
succeed
a
courtier
should
have
neither
honour
nor
character
as
regards
virtue
one
must
be
prodigiously
virtuous
to
dare
to
say
the
truth
the
virtuous
man
is
much
more
at
his
ease
in
a
republic
he
has
no
one
to
flatter
do
you
think
said
the
man
from
europe
that
laws
and
religions
are
made
for
climates
just
as
one
has
to
have
furs
in
moscow
and
gauzy
stuffs
in
delhi
without
a
doubt
answered
the
brahmin
all
the
laws
which
concern
material
things
are
calculated
for
the
meridian
one
lives
in
a
german
needs
only
one
wife
and
a
persian
three
or
four
the
rites
of
religion
are
of
the
same
nature
how
if
i
were
christian
should
i
say
mass
in
my
province
where
there
is
neither
bread
nor
wine
as
regards
dogmas
that
is
another
matter
the
climate
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
did
not
your
religion
begin
in
asia
whence
it
was
driven
out
does
it
not
exist
near
the
baltic
sea
where
it
was
unknown
in
what
state
under
what
domination
would
you
like
best
to
live
asked
the
councillor
anywhere
but
where
i
do
live
answered
his
companion
and
i
have
met
many
siamese
tonkinese
persians
and
turks
who
said
as
much
but
once
again
persisted
the
european
what
state
would
you
choose
the
brahmin
answered
the
state
where
only
the
laws
are
obeyed
that
is
an
old
answer
said
the
councillor
it
is
none
the
worse
for
that
said
the
brahmin
where
is
that
country
asked
the
councillor
we
must
look
for
it
answered
the
brahmin
the
superstitious
man
is
to
the
rogue
what
the
slave
is
to
the
tyrant
further
the
superstitious
man
is
governed
by
the
fanatic
and
becomes
fanatic
superstition
born
in
paganism
adopted
by
judaism
infested
the
christian
church
from
the
earliest
times
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
without
exception
believed
in
the
power
of
magic
the
church
always
condemned
magic
but
she
always
believed
in
it
she
did
not
excommunicate
sorcerers
as
madmen
who
were
mistaken
but
as
men
who
were
really
in
communication
with
the
devil
one
half
of
europe
thinks
that
the
other
half
has
long
been
and
still
is
superstitious
the
protestants
regard
the
relics
the
indulgences
the
mortifications
the
prayers
for
the
dead
the
holy
water
and
almost
all
the
rites
of
the
roman
church
as
a
superstitious
dementia
superstition
according
to
them
consists
in
taking
useless
practices
for
necessary
practices
among
the
roman
catholics
there
are
some
more
enlightened
than
their
ancestors
who
have
renounced
many
of
these
usages
formerly
considered
sacred
and
they
defend
themselves
against
the
others
who
have
retained
them
by
saying
they
are
indifferent
and
what
is
merely
indifferent
can
not
be
an
evil
it
is
difficult
to
mark
the
limits
of
superstition
a
frenchman
travelling
in
italy
finds
almost
everything
superstitious
and
is
hardly
mistaken
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
maintains
that
the
archbishop
of
paris
is
superstitious
the
presbyterians
make
the
same
reproach
against
his
grace
of
canterbury
and
are
in
their
turn
treated
as
superstitious
by
the
quakers
who
are
the
most
superstitious
of
all
in
the
eyes
of
other
christians
in
christian
societies
therefore
no
one
agrees
as
to
what
superstition
is
the
sect
which
seems
to
be
the
least
attacked
by
this
malady
of
the
intelligence
is
that
which
has
the
fewest
rites
but
if
with
few
ceremonies
it
is
still
strongly
attached
to
an
absurd
belief
this
absurd
belief
is
equivalent
alone
to
all
the
superstitious
practices
observed
from
the
time
of
simon
the
magician
to
that
of
father
gauffridi
it
is
therefore
clear
that
it
is
the
fundamentals
of
the
religion
of
one
sect
which
is
considered
as
superstition
by
another
sect
the
moslems
accuse
all
christian
societies
of
it
and
are
themselves
accused
who
will
judge
this
great
matter
will
it
be
reason
but
each
sect
claims
to
have
reason
on
its
side
it
will
therefore
be
force
which
will
judge
while
awaiting
the
time
when
reason
will
penetrate
a
sufficient
number
of
heads
to
disarm
force
up
to
what
point
does
statecraft
permit
superstition
to
be
destroyed
this
is
a
very
thorny
question
it
is
like
asking
up
to
what
point
one
should
make
an
incision
in
a
dropsical
person
who
may
die
under
the
operation
it
is
a
matter
for
the
doctor
discretion
can
there
exist
a
people
free
from
all
superstitious
prejudices
that
is
to
ask
can
there
exist
a
nation
of
philosophers
it
is
said
that
there
is
no
superstition
in
the
magistrature
of
china
it
is
probable
that
none
will
remain
in
the
magistrature
of
a
few
towns
of
europe
then
the
magistrates
will
stop
the
superstition
of
the
people
from
being
dangerous
these
magistrates
example
will
not
enlighten
the
mob
but
the
principal
persons
of
the
will
hold
the
mob
in
check
there
is
not
perhaps
a
single
riot
a
single
religious
outrage
in
which
the
were
not
formerly
imbrued
because
these
middle
classes
were
then
the
mob
but
reason
and
time
will
have
changed
them
their
softened
manners
will
soften
those
of
the
lowest
and
most
savage
populace
it
is
a
thing
of
which
we
have
striking
examples
in
more
than
one
country
in
a
word
less
superstition
less
fanaticism
and
less
fanaticism
less
misery
tears
are
the
mute
language
of
sorrow
but
why
what
connection
is
there
between
a
sad
idea
and
this
limpid
salt
liquid
filtered
through
a
little
gland
at
the
external
corner
of
the
eye
which
moistens
the
conjunctiva
and
the
small
lachrymal
points
whence
it
descends
into
the
nose
and
mouth
through
the
reservoir
called
the
lachrymal
sack
and
its
ducts
why
in
women
and
children
whose
organs
are
part
of
a
frail
and
delicate
network
are
tears
more
easily
excited
by
sorrow
than
in
grown
men
whose
tissue
is
firmer
did
nature
wish
compassion
to
be
born
in
us
at
sight
of
these
tears
which
soften
us
and
lead
us
to
help
those
who
shed
them
the
woman
of
a
savage
race
is
as
firmly
determined
to
help
the
child
that
cries
as
would
be
a
woman
of
the
court
and
maybe
more
because
she
has
fewer
distractions
and
passions
in
the
animal
body
everything
has
an
object
without
a
doubt
the
eyes
especially
bear
such
evident
such
proven
such
admirable
relation
to
the
rays
of
light
this
mechanism
is
so
divine
that
i
should
be
tempted
to
take
for
a
delirium
of
burning
fever
the
audacity
which
denies
the
final
causes
of
the
structure
of
our
eyes
the
use
of
tears
does
not
seem
to
have
so
well
determined
and
striking
an
object
but
it
would
be
beautiful
that
nature
made
them
flow
in
order
to
stir
us
to
pity
there
are
women
who
are
accused
of
weeping
when
they
wish
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
at
their
talent
a
live
sensitive
tender
imagination
can
fix
itself
on
some
object
on
some
sorrowful
memory
and
picture
it
in
such
dominating
colours
that
they
wring
tears
from
it
it
is
what
happens
to
many
actors
and
principally
to
actresses
on
the
stage
the
women
who
imitate
them
in
their
own
homes
add
to
this
talent
the
petty
fraud
of
appearing
to
weep
for
their
husbands
whereas
in
fact
they
are
weeping
for
their
lovers
their
tears
are
true
but
the
object
of
them
is
false
one
asks
why
the
same
man
who
has
watched
the
most
atrocious
events
who
even
has
committed
crimes
will
weep
at
the
theatre
at
the
representation
of
these
events
and
crimes
it
is
that
he
does
not
see
them
with
the
same
eyes
he
sees
them
with
the
eyes
of
the
author
and
the
actor
he
is
no
longer
the
same
man
he
was
a
barbarian
he
was
agitated
by
furious
passions
when
he
saw
an
innocent
woman
killed
when
he
stained
himself
with
his
friend
blood
his
soul
was
filled
with
stormy
tumult
it
is
tranquil
it
is
empty
nature
returns
to
it
he
sheds
virtuous
tears
that
is
the
true
merit
the
great
good
of
the
theatres
there
is
achieved
what
can
never
be
achieved
by
the
frigid
declamations
of
an
orator
paid
to
bore
the
whole
of
an
audience
for
an
hour
david
the
capitoul
who
without
emotion
caused
and
saw
the
death
of
innocent
calas
on
the
wheel
would
have
shed
tears
at
the
sight
of
his
own
crime
in
a
and
tragedy
it
is
thus
that
pope
has
said
in
the
prologue
to
addison
cato
tyrants
no
more
their
savage
nature
kept
and
foes
to
virtue
wondered
how
they
wept
the
theist
is
a
man
firmly
persuaded
of
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
as
good
as
he
is
powerful
who
has
formed
all
beings
with
extension
vegetating
sentient
and
reflecting
who
perpetuates
their
species
who
punishes
crimes
without
cruelty
and
rewards
virtuous
actions
with
kindness
the
theist
does
not
know
how
god
punishes
how
he
protects
how
he
pardons
for
he
is
not
reckless
enough
to
flatter
himself
that
he
knows
how
god
acts
but
he
knows
that
god
acts
and
that
he
is
just
difficulties
against
providence
do
not
shake
him
in
his
faith
because
they
are
merely
great
difficulties
and
not
proofs
he
submits
to
this
providence
although
he
perceives
but
a
few
effects
and
a
few
signs
of
this
providence
and
judging
of
the
things
he
does
not
see
by
the
things
he
sees
he
considers
that
this
providence
reaches
all
places
and
all
centuries
reconciled
in
this
principle
with
the
rest
of
the
universe
he
does
not
embrace
any
of
the
sects
all
of
which
contradict
each
other
his
religion
is
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
widespread
for
the
simple
worship
of
a
god
has
preceded
all
the
systems
of
the
world
he
speaks
a
language
that
all
peoples
understand
while
they
do
not
understand
one
another
he
has
brothers
from
pekin
to
cayenne
and
he
counts
all
wise
men
as
his
brethren
he
believes
that
religion
does
not
consist
either
in
the
opinions
of
an
unintelligible
metaphysic
or
in
vain
display
but
in
worship
and
justice
the
doing
of
good
there
is
his
service
being
submissive
to
god
there
is
his
doctrine
the
mahometan
cries
to
him
have
a
care
if
you
do
not
make
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
woe
unto
you
says
a
recollet
if
you
do
not
make
a
journey
to
de
lorette
he
laughs
at
lorette
and
at
mecca
but
he
succours
the
needy
and
defends
the
oppressed
what
is
tolerance
it
is
the
consequence
of
humanity
we
are
all
formed
of
frailty
and
error
let
us
pardon
reciprocally
each
folly
that
is
the
first
law
of
nature
it
is
clear
that
the
individual
who
persecutes
a
man
his
brother
because
he
is
not
of
the
same
opinion
is
a
monster
that
admits
of
no
difficulty
but
the
government
but
the
magistrates
but
the
princes
how
do
they
treat
those
who
have
another
worship
than
theirs
if
they
are
powerful
strangers
it
is
certain
that
a
prince
will
make
an
alliance
with
them
françois
very
christian
will
unite
with
mussulmans
against
charles
very
catholic
françois
will
give
money
to
the
lutherans
of
germany
to
support
them
in
their
revolt
against
the
emperor
but
in
accordance
with
custom
he
will
start
by
having
lutherans
burned
at
home
for
political
reasons
he
pays
them
in
saxony
for
political
reasons
he
burns
them
in
paris
but
what
will
happen
persecutions
make
proselytes
soon
france
will
be
full
of
new
protestants
at
first
they
will
let
themselves
be
hanged
later
they
in
their
turn
will
hang
there
will
be
civil
wars
then
will
come
the
bartholomew
and
this
corner
of
the
world
will
be
worse
than
all
that
the
ancients
and
moderns
have
ever
told
of
hell
madmen
who
have
never
been
able
to
give
worship
to
the
god
who
made
you
miscreants
whom
the
example
of
the
noachides
the
learned
chinese
the
parsees
and
all
the
sages
has
never
been
able
to
lead
monsters
who
need
superstitions
as
crows
gizzards
need
carrion
you
have
been
told
it
already
and
there
is
nothing
else
to
tell
you
if
you
have
two
religions
in
your
countries
they
will
cut
each
other
throat
if
you
have
thirty
religions
they
will
dwell
in
peace
look
at
the
great
turk
he
governs
guebres
banians
greek
christians
nestorians
romans
the
first
who
tried
to
stir
up
tumult
would
be
impaled
and
everyone
is
tranquil
of
all
religions
the
christian
is
without
doubt
the
one
which
should
inspire
tolerance
most
although
up
to
now
the
christians
have
been
the
most
intolerant
of
all
men
the
christian
church
was
divided
in
its
cradle
and
was
divided
even
in
the
persecutions
which
under
the
first
emperors
it
sometimes
endured
often
the
martyr
was
regarded
as
an
apostate
by
his
brethren
and
the
carpocratian
christian
expired
beneath
the
sword
of
the
roman
executioners
excommunicated
by
the
ebionite
christian
the
which
ebionite
was
anathema
to
the
sabellian
this
horrible
discord
which
has
lasted
for
so
many
centuries
is
a
very
striking
lesson
that
we
should
pardon
each
other
errors
discord
is
the
great
ill
of
mankind
and
tolerance
is
the
only
remedy
for
it
there
is
nobody
who
is
not
in
agreement
with
this
truth
whether
he
meditates
soberly
in
his
study
or
peaceably
examines
the
truth
with
his
friends
why
then
do
the
same
men
who
admit
in
private
indulgence
kindness
justice
rise
in
public
with
so
much
fury
against
these
virtues
why
it
is
that
their
own
interest
is
their
god
and
that
they
sacrifice
everything
to
this
monster
that
they
worship
i
possess
a
dignity
and
a
power
founded
on
ignorance
and
credulity
i
walk
on
the
heads
of
the
men
who
lie
prostrate
at
my
feet
if
they
should
rise
and
look
me
in
the
face
i
am
lost
i
must
bind
them
to
the
ground
therefore
with
iron
chains
thus
have
reasoned
the
men
whom
centuries
of
bigotry
have
made
powerful
they
have
other
powerful
men
beneath
them
and
these
have
still
others
who
all
enrich
themselves
with
the
spoils
of
the
poor
grow
fat
on
their
blood
and
laugh
at
their
stupidity
they
all
detest
tolerance
as
partisans
grown
rich
at
the
public
expense
fear
to
render
their
accounts
and
as
tyrants
dread
the
word
liberty
and
then
to
crown
everything
they
hire
fanatics
to
cry
at
the
top
of
their
voices
respect
my
master
absurdities
tremble
pay
and
keep
your
mouths
shut
it
is
thus
that
a
great
part
of
the
world
long
was
treated
but
when
so
many
sects
make
a
balance
of
power
what
course
to
take
with
them
every
sect
as
one
knows
is
a
ground
of
error
there
are
no
sects
of
geometers
algebraists
arithmeticians
because
all
the
propositions
of
geometry
algebra
and
arithmetic
are
true
in
every
other
science
one
may
be
deceived
what
thomist
or
scotist
theologian
would
dare
say
seriously
that
he
is
sure
of
his
case
if
it
were
permitted
to
reason
consistently
in
religious
matters
it
is
clear
that
we
all
ought
to
become
jews
because
jesus
christ
our
saviour
was
born
a
jew
lived
a
jew
died
a
jew
and
that
he
said
expressly
that
he
was
accomplishing
that
he
was
fulfilling
the
jewish
religion
but
it
is
clearer
still
that
we
ought
to
be
tolerant
of
one
another
because
we
are
all
weak
inconsistent
liable
to
fickleness
and
error
shall
a
reed
laid
low
in
the
mud
by
the
wind
say
to
a
fellow
reed
fallen
in
the
opposite
direction
crawl
as
i
crawl
wretch
or
i
shall
petition
that
you
be
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
burned
pilate
therefore
said
unto
him
art
thou
a
king
then
jesus
answered
thou
sayest
that
i
am
a
king
to
this
end
was
i
born
and
for
this
cause
came
i
into
the
world
that
i
should
bear
witness
unto
the
truth
everyone
that
is
of
the
truth
heareth
my
voice
pilate
saith
unto
him
what
is
truth
and
when
he
had
said
this
he
went
out
etc
john
xviii
it
is
a
sad
thing
for
the
human
race
that
pilate
went
out
without
waiting
for
the
answer
we
should
know
what
truth
is
pilate
had
very
little
curiosity
the
accused
led
before
him
says
he
is
king
that
he
was
to
be
king
and
pilate
does
not
inquire
how
that
can
be
he
is
supreme
judge
in
cæsar
name
he
has
power
of
life
and
death
his
duty
was
to
probe
the
sense
of
these
words
he
ought
to
say
tell
me
what
you
understand
by
being
king
how
were
you
born
to
be
king
and
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
it
is
maintained
that
truth
reaches
but
with
difficulty
to
the
ear
of
kings
i
am
judge
i
have
always
had
great
trouble
in
finding
it
while
your
enemies
are
howling
against
you
without
give
me
some
information
on
the
point
you
will
be
doing
me
the
greatest
service
that
has
ever
been
done
a
judge
and
i
much
prefer
to
learn
to
recognize
truth
than
to
accede
to
the
jews
clamorous
demand
to
have
you
hanged
we
shall
not
dare
to
be
sure
seek
what
the
author
of
all
truth
would
have
been
able
to
reply
to
pilate
would
he
have
said
truth
is
an
abstract
word
which
most
men
use
indifferently
in
their
books
and
judgments
for
error
and
falsehood
this
definition
would
have
been
marvellously
appropriate
to
all
makers
of
systems
similarly
is
the
word
wisdom
taken
often
for
folly
and
wit
for
nonsense
humanly
speaking
let
us
define
truth
while
waiting
for
a
better
definition
as
a
statement
of
the
facts
as
they
are
i
suppose
that
if
one
had
given
only
six
months
to
teaching
pilate
the
truths
of
logic
he
would
assuredly
have
made
this
conclusive
syllogism
one
must
not
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
who
has
only
preached
good
morality
well
the
man
who
has
been
impeached
has
on
the
showing
of
his
enemies
even
often
preached
excellent
morality
therefore
he
should
not
be
punished
with
death
he
might
have
drawn
this
further
argument
my
duty
is
to
disperse
the
riotous
assemblage
of
a
seditious
people
who
demand
a
man
death
unreasonably
and
without
legal
form
well
that
is
the
position
of
the
jews
in
this
instance
therefore
i
must
drive
them
away
and
break
up
their
meeting
we
suppose
that
pilate
knew
arithmetic
hence
we
will
not
speak
of
those
forms
of
truth
as
regards
mathematical
truths
i
think
it
would
have
taken
at
least
three
years
before
he
could
have
learned
higher
geometry
the
truths
of
physics
combined
with
those
of
geometry
would
have
demanded
more
than
four
years
we
spend
six
ordinarily
in
studying
theology
i
ask
twelve
for
pilate
seeing
that
he
was
pagan
and
that
six
years
would
not
have
been
too
much
for
eradicating
all
his
old
errors
and
six
years
more
for
making
him
fit
to
receive
a
doctor
hood
if
pilate
had
had
a
mind
i
should
have
asked
only
two
years
to
teach
him
metaphysical
truth
and
as
metaphysical
truth
is
necessarily
allied
to
moral
truth
i
flatter
myself
that
in
less
than
nine
years
he
would
have
become
a
real
scholar
and
a
perfectly
honest
man
i
should
then
have
said
to
pilate
historical
truths
are
merely
probabilities
if
you
had
fought
at
the
battle
of
philippi
that
is
for
you
a
truth
which
you
know
by
intuition
by
perception
but
for
us
who
dwell
near
the
syrian
desert
it
is
merely
a
very
probable
thing
which
we
know
by
hearsay
how
much
hearsay
is
necessary
to
form
a
conviction
equal
to
that
of
a
man
who
having
seen
the
thing
can
flatter
himself
that
he
has
a
sort
of
certainty
he
who
has
heard
the
thing
told
by
twelve
thousand
eyewitnesses
has
only
twelve
thousand
probabilities
equal
to
one
strong
probability
which
is
not
equal
to
certainty
if
you
have
the
thing
from
only
one
of
these
witnesses
you
know
nothing
you
should
be
sceptical
if
the
witness
is
dead
you
should
be
still
more
sceptical
for
you
can
not
enlighten
yourself
if
from
several
witnesses
who
are
dead
you
are
in
the
same
plight
if
from
those
to
whom
the
witnesses
have
spoken
your
scepticism
should
increase
still
more
from
generation
to
generation
scepticism
increases
and
probability
diminishes
and
soon
probability
is
reduced
to
zero
one
gives
the
name
of
tyrant
to
the
sovereign
who
knows
no
laws
but
those
of
his
caprice
who
takes
his
subjects
property
and
who
afterwards
enrols
them
to
go
to
take
the
property
of
his
neighbours
there
are
none
of
these
tyrants
in
europe
one
distinguishes
between
the
tyranny
of
one
man
and
that
of
many
the
tyranny
of
many
would
be
that
of
a
body
which
invaded
the
rights
of
other
bodies
and
which
exercised
despotism
in
favour
of
the
laws
corrupted
by
it
nor
are
there
any
tyrants
of
this
sort
in
europe
under
which
tyranny
would
you
like
to
live
under
neither
but
if
i
had
to
choose
i
should
detest
the
tyranny
of
one
man
less
than
that
of
many
a
despot
always
has
his
good
moments
an
assembly
of
despots
never
if
a
tyrant
does
me
an
injustice
i
can
disarm
him
through
his
mistress
his
confessor
or
his
page
but
a
company
of
grave
tyrants
is
inaccessible
to
all
seductions
when
it
is
not
unjust
it
is
at
the
least
hard
and
never
does
it
bestow
favours
if
i
have
only
one
despot
i
am
quit
of
him
by
drawing
myself
up
against
a
wall
when
i
see
him
pass
or
by
bowing
low
or
by
striking
the
ground
with
my
forehead
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
but
if
there
is
a
company
of
a
hundred
despots
i
am
exposed
to
repeating
this
ceremony
a
hundred
times
a
day
which
in
the
long
run
is
very
annoying
if
one
hocks
are
not
supple
if
i
have
a
farm
in
the
neighbourhood
of
one
of
our
lords
i
am
crushed
if
i
plead
against
a
relation
of
the
relations
of
one
of
our
lords
i
am
ruined
what
is
to
be
done
i
fear
that
in
this
world
one
is
reduced
to
being
either
hammer
or
anvil
lucky
the
man
who
escapes
these
alternatives
section
i
it
is
said
of
marcus
brutus
that
before
killing
himself
he
uttered
these
words
o
virtue
i
thought
you
were
something
but
you
are
only
an
empty
phantom
you
were
right
brutus
if
you
considered
virtue
as
being
head
of
a
faction
and
assassin
of
your
benefactor
but
if
you
had
considered
virtue
as
consisting
only
of
doing
good
to
those
dependent
on
you
you
would
not
have
called
it
a
phantom
and
you
would
not
have
killed
yourself
in
despair
i
am
very
virtuous
says
this
excrement
of
theology
for
i
have
the
four
cardinal
virtues
and
the
three
divine
an
honest
man
asks
him
what
is
the
cardinal
virtue
the
other
answers
strength
prudence
temperance
and
justice
the
honest
man
if
you
are
just
you
have
said
everything
your
strength
your
prudence
your
temperance
are
useful
qualities
if
you
have
them
so
much
the
better
for
you
but
if
you
are
just
so
much
the
better
for
the
others
but
it
is
not
enough
to
be
just
you
must
do
good
that
is
what
is
really
cardinal
and
your
divine
virtues
which
are
they
the
excrement
faith
hope
charity
the
honest
man
is
it
a
virtue
to
believe
either
what
you
believe
seems
true
to
you
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
merit
in
believing
or
it
seems
false
to
you
and
then
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
believe
hope
can
not
be
a
virtue
any
more
than
fear
one
fears
and
one
hopes
according
as
one
receives
a
promise
or
a
threat
as
for
charity
is
it
not
what
the
greeks
and
the
romans
understood
by
humanity
love
of
neighbour
this
love
is
nothing
if
it
be
not
active
doing
good
therefore
is
the
sole
true
virtue
the
excrement
one
would
be
a
fool
really
i
am
to
give
myself
a
deal
of
torment
in
order
to
serve
mankind
and
i
shall
get
no
return
all
work
deserves
payment
i
do
not
mean
to
do
the
least
honest
action
unless
i
am
certain
of
paradise
the
honest
man
ah
master
that
is
to
say
that
if
you
did
not
hope
for
paradise
and
if
you
did
not
fear
hell
you
would
never
do
any
good
action
believe
me
master
there
are
two
things
worthy
of
being
loved
for
themselves
god
and
virtue
the
excrement
i
see
sir
you
are
a
disciple
of
fénélon
the
honest
man
yes
master
the
excrement
i
shall
denounce
you
to
the
judge
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
at
meaux
the
honest
man
go
along
denounce
section
ii
what
is
virtue
beneficence
towards
the
can
i
call
virtue
things
other
than
those
which
do
me
good
i
am
needy
you
are
generous
i
am
in
danger
you
help
me
i
am
deceived
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
am
neglected
you
console
me
i
am
ignorant
you
teach
me
without
difficulty
i
shall
call
you
virtuous
but
what
will
become
of
the
cardinal
and
divine
virtues
some
of
them
will
remain
in
the
schools
what
does
it
matter
to
me
that
you
are
temperate
you
observe
a
precept
of
health
you
will
have
better
health
and
i
am
happy
to
hear
it
you
have
faith
and
hope
and
i
am
happy
still
they
will
procure
you
eternal
life
your
divine
virtues
are
celestial
gifts
your
cardinal
virtues
are
excellent
qualities
which
serve
to
guide
you
but
they
are
not
virtues
as
regards
your
the
prudent
man
does
good
to
himself
the
virtuous
man
does
good
to
mankind
paul
was
right
to
tell
you
that
charity
prevails
over
faith
and
hope
but
shall
only
those
that
are
useful
to
one
be
admitted
as
virtues
how
can
i
admit
any
others
we
live
in
society
really
therefore
the
only
things
that
are
good
for
us
are
those
that
are
good
for
society
a
recluse
will
be
sober
pious
he
will
be
clad
in
he
will
be
a
saint
but
i
shall
not
call
him
virtuous
until
he
has
done
some
act
of
virtue
by
which
other
men
have
profited
so
long
as
he
is
alone
he
is
doing
neither
good
nor
evil
for
us
he
is
nothing
if
bruno
brought
peace
to
families
if
he
succoured
want
he
was
virtuous
if
he
fasted
prayed
in
solitude
he
was
a
saint
virtue
among
men
is
an
interchange
of
kindness
he
who
has
no
part
in
this
interchange
should
not
be
counted
if
this
saint
were
in
the
world
he
would
doubtless
do
good
but
so
long
as
he
is
not
in
the
world
the
world
will
be
right
in
refusing
him
the
title
of
virtuous
he
will
be
good
for
himself
and
not
for
us
but
you
say
to
me
if
a
recluse
is
a
glutton
a
drunkard
given
to
secret
debauches
with
himself
he
is
vicious
he
is
virtuous
therefore
if
he
has
the
opposite
qualities
that
is
what
i
can
not
agree
he
is
a
very
disagreeable
fellow
if
he
has
the
faults
you
mention
but
he
is
not
vicious
wicked
punishable
as
regards
society
to
whom
these
infamies
do
no
harm
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
were
he
to
return
to
society
he
would
do
harm
there
that
he
would
be
very
vicious
and
it
is
even
more
probable
that
he
would
be
a
wicked
man
than
it
is
sure
that
the
other
temperate
and
chaste
recluse
would
be
a
virtuous
man
for
in
society
faults
increase
and
good
qualities
diminish
a
much
stronger
objection
is
made
nero
pope
alexander
and
other
monsters
of
this
species
have
bestowed
kindnesses
i
answer
hardily
that
on
that
day
they
were
virtuous
a
few
theologians
say
that
the
divine
emperor
antonine
was
not
virtuous
that
he
was
a
stubborn
stoic
who
not
content
with
commanding
men
wished
further
to
be
esteemed
by
them
that
he
attributed
to
himself
the
good
he
did
to
the
human
race
that
all
his
life
he
was
just
laborious
beneficent
through
vanity
and
that
he
only
deceived
men
through
his
virtues
my
god
i
exclaim
give
us
often
rogues
like
him
why
does
one
hardly
ever
do
the
tenth
part
of
the
good
one
might
do
why
in
half
europe
do
girls
pray
to
god
in
latin
which
they
do
not
understand
why
in
antiquity
was
there
never
a
theological
quarrel
and
why
were
no
people
ever
distinguished
by
the
name
of
a
sect
the
egyptians
were
not
called
isiacs
or
osiriacs
the
peoples
of
syria
did
not
have
the
name
of
cybelians
the
cretans
had
a
particular
devotion
to
jupiter
and
were
never
entitled
jupiterians
the
ancient
latins
were
very
attached
to
saturn
there
was
not
a
village
in
latium
called
saturnian
on
the
contrary
the
disciples
of
the
god
of
truth
taking
their
master
title
and
calling
themselves
anointed
like
him
declared
as
soon
as
they
could
an
eternal
war
on
all
the
peoples
who
were
not
anointed
and
made
war
among
themselves
for
fourteen
hundred
years
taking
the
names
of
arians
manicheans
donatists
hussites
papists
lutherans
calvinists
and
lastly
the
jansenists
and
the
molinists
have
had
no
more
poignant
mortification
than
that
of
not
having
been
able
to
slaughter
each
other
in
pitched
battle
whence
does
this
come
why
is
the
great
number
of
innocent
men
who
till
the
land
every
day
of
the
year
that
you
may
eat
all
its
fruits
scorned
vilified
oppressed
robbed
and
why
is
it
that
the
useless
and
often
very
wicked
man
who
lives
only
by
their
work
and
who
is
rich
only
through
their
poverty
is
on
the
contrary
respected
courted
considered
why
is
it
that
the
fruits
of
the
earth
being
so
necessary
for
the
conservation
of
men
and
animals
one
yet
sees
so
many
years
and
so
many
countries
where
there
is
entire
lack
of
these
fruits
why
is
the
half
of
africa
and
america
covered
with
poisons
why
is
there
no
land
where
insects
are
not
far
in
excess
of
men
why
does
a
little
whitish
secretion
form
a
being
which
has
hard
bones
desires
and
thoughts
and
why
do
these
beings
always
persecute
each
other
why
does
so
much
evil
exist
seeing
that
everything
is
formed
by
a
god
whom
all
theists
are
agreed
in
naming
good
why
since
we
complain
ceaselessly
of
our
ills
do
we
spend
all
our
time
in
increasing
them
why
as
we
are
so
miserable
have
we
imagined
that
not
to
be
is
a
great
ill
when
it
is
clear
that
it
was
not
an
ill
not
to
be
before
we
were
born
why
and
how
does
one
have
dreams
during
sleep
if
one
has
no
soul
and
how
is
it
that
these
dreams
are
always
so
incoherent
so
extravagant
if
one
has
a
soul
why
do
the
stars
move
from
west
to
east
rather
than
from
east
to
west
why
do
we
exist
why
is
there
anything
of
the
admirers
questioners
and
doubters
who
have
amused
themselves
by
propounding
to
the
scholars
the
above
questions
in
nine
we
declare
to
the
scholars
that
being
like
them
prodigiously
ignorant
about
the
first
principles
of
all
things
and
about
the
natural
typical
mystic
allegorical
sense
of
many
things
we
refer
these
things
to
the
infallible
judgment
of
the
holy
inquisition
of
rome
florence
madrid
lisbon
and
to
the
decrees
of
the
sorbonne
of
paris
perpetual
council
of
the
gauls
our
errors
springing
in
no
wise
from
malice
but
being
the
natural
consequence
of
human
frailty
we
hope
that
they
will
be
pardoned
to
us
in
this
world
and
the
other
we
beseech
the
small
number
of
heavenly
spirits
who
are
still
shut
up
in
france
in
mortal
bodies
and
who
from
there
enlighten
the
universe
at
the
sheet
to
communicate
their
luminousness
to
us
for
the
tenth
volume
which
we
reckon
on
publishing
at
the
end
of
lent

in
advent

for
their
luminousness
we
will

curious

favours
