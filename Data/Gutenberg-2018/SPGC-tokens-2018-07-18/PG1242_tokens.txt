unconscious

leon
de
lora
our
celebrated
landscape
painter
belongs
to
one
of
the
noblest
families
of
the
roussillon
spanish
originally
which
although
distinguished
for
the
antiquity
of
its
race
has
been
doomed
for
a
century
to
the
proverbial
poverty
of
hidalgos
coming
to
paris
from
the
department
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
with
the
sum
of
eleven
francs
in
his
pocket
for
all
viaticum
he
had
in
some
degree
forgotten
the
miseries
and
privations
of
his
childhood
and
his
family
amid
the
other
privations
and
miseries
which
are
never
lacking
to
rapins
whose
whole
fortune
consists
of
intrepid
vocation
later
the
cares
of
fame
and
those
of
success
were
other
causes
of
forgetfulness
if
you
have
followed
the
capricious
and
meandering
course
of
these
studies
perhaps
you
will
remember
mistigris
schinner
s
pupil
one
of
the
heroes
of
a
start
in
life
scenes
from
private
life
and
his
brief
apparitions
in
other
scenes
in
this
landscape
painter
emulator
of
the
hobbemas
ruysdaels
and
lorraines
resembles
no
more
the
shabby
frisky
rapin
whom
we
then
knew
now
an
illustrious
man
he
owns
a
charming
house
in
the
rue
de
berlin
not
far
from
the
hotel
de
brambourg
where
his
friend
brideau
lives
and
quite
close
to
the
house
of
schinner
his
early
master
he
is
a
member
of
the
institute
and
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
is
years
old
has
an
income
of
twenty
thousand
francs
from
the
funds
his
pictures
sell
for
their
weight
in
gold
and
what
seems
to
him
more
extraordinary
than
the
invitations
he
receives
occasionally
to
court
balls
his
name
and
fame
mentioned
so
often
for
the
last
sixteen
years
by
the
press
of
europe
has
at
last
penetrated
to
the
valley
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
where
vegetate
three
veritable
loras
his
father
his
eldest
brother
and
an
old
paternal
aunt
mademoiselle
urraca
y
lora
in
the
maternal
line
the
painter
has
no
relation
left
except
a
cousin
the
nephew
of
his
mother
residing
in
a
small
manufacturing
town
in
the
department
this
cousin
was
the
first
to
bethink
himself
of
leon
but
it
was
not
until
that
leon
de
lora
received
a
letter
from
monsieur
sylvestre
called
simply
gazonal
to
which
he
replied
that
he
was
assuredly
himself
that
is
to
say
the
son
of
the
late
leonie
gazonal
wife
of
comte
fernand
didas
y
lora
during
the
summer
of
cousin
sylvestre
gazonal
went
to
inform
the
illustrious
unknown
family
of
lora
that
their
little
leon
had
not
gone
to
the
rio
de
la
plata
as
they
supposed
but
was
now
one
of
the
greatest
geniuses
of
the
french
school
of
painting
a
fact
the
family
did
not
believe
the
eldest
son
don
juan
de
lora
assured
his
cousin
gazonal
that
he
was
certainly
the
dupe
of
some
parisian
wag
now
the
said
gazonal
was
intending
to
go
to
paris
to
prosecute
a
lawsuit
which
the
prefect
of
the
eastern
pyrenees
had
arbitrarily
removed
from
the
usual
jurisdiction
transferring
it
to
that
of
the
council
of
state
the
worthy
provincial
determined
to
investigate
this
act
and
to
ask
his
parisian
cousin
the
reason
of
such
measures
it
thus
happened
that
monsieur
gazonal
came
to
paris
took
shabby
lodgings
in
the
rue
and
was
amazed
to
see
the
palace
of
his
cousin
in
the
rue
de
berlin
being
told
that
the
painter
was
then
travelling
in
italy
he
renounced
for
the
time
being
the
intention
of
asking
his
advice
and
doubted
if
he
should
ever
find
his
maternal
relationship
acknowledged
by
so
great
a
man
during
the
years
and
gazonal
attended
to
his
lawsuit
this
suit
concerned
a
question
as
to
the
current
and
level
of
a
stream
of
water
and
the
necessity
of
removing
a
dam
in
which
dispute
the
administration
instigated
by
the
abutters
on
the
river
banks
had
meddled
the
removal
of
the
dam
threatened
the
existence
of
gazonal
s
manufactory
in
gazonal
considered
his
cause
as
wholly
lost
the
secretary
of
the
master
of
petitions
charged
with
the
duty
of
drawing
up
the
report
had
confided
to
him
that
the
said
report
would
assuredly
be
against
him
and
his
own
lawyer
confirmed
the
statement
gazonal
though
commander
of
the
national
guard
in
his
own
town
and
one
of
the
most
capable
manufacturers
of
the
department
found
himself
of
so
little
account
in
paris
and
he
was
moreover
so
frightened
by
the
costs
of
living
and
the
dearness
of
even
the
most
trifling
things
that
he
kept
himself
all
this
time
secluded
in
his
shabby
lodgings
the
southerner
deprived
of
his
sun
execrated
paris
which
he
called
a
manufactory
of
rheumatism
as
he
added
up
the
costs
of
his
suit
and
his
living
he
vowed
within
himself
to
poison
the
prefect
on
his
return
or
to
minotaurize
him
in
his
moments
of
deepest
sadness
he
killed
the
prefect
outright
in
gayer
mood
he
contented
himself
with
minotaurizing
him
one
morning
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
and
cursed
his
fate
he
picked
up
a
newspaper
savagely
the
following
lines
ending
an
article
struck
gazonal
as
if
the
mysterious
voice
which
speaks
to
gamblers
before
they
win
had
sounded
in
his
ear
our
celebrated
landscape
painter
leon
de
lora
lately
returned
from
italy
will
exhibit
several
pictures
at
the
salon
thus
the
exhibition
promises
as
we
see
to
be
most
with
the
suddenness
of
action
that
distinguishes
the
sons
of
the
sunny
south
gazonal

from
his
lodgings
to

street
from

drove
to
the
rue

to
find
his
cousin
leon
de

sent
word
by
a
servant
to
his
cousin
gazonal
that
he
invited
him
to
breakfast
the
next
day
at
the
cafe
de
paris
but
he
was
now
engaged
in
a
matter
which
did
not
allow
him
to
receive
his
cousin
at
the
present
moment
gazonal
like
a
true
southerner
recounted
all
his
troubles
to
the
valet
the
next
day
at
ten
o
clock
gazonal
much
too
for
the
occasion
he
had
put
on
his
coat
with
brass
buttons
a
frilled
shirt
a
white
waistcoat
and
yellow
gloves
awaited
his
amphitryon
a
full
hour
stamping
his
feet
on
the
boulevard
after
hearing
from
the
master
of
the
cafe
that
these
gentlemen
breakfasted
habitually
between
eleven
and
twelve
o
clock
between
eleven
and
he
said
when
he
related
his
adventures
to
his
cronies
in
the
provinces
two
parisians
dressed
in
simple
looking
like

called
out
when
they
saw
me
on
the
boulevard
there

our
gazonal
the
speaker
was
bixiou

leon
de

had
armed
himself
to
bring
out

words
to

at
your
service

out
that
little
leon

me
in
his
arms
related
gazonal
on
his
return
home
the
breakfast
was
splendid
i
thought
i
was
going
blind
when
i
saw
the
number
of
bits
of
gold
it
took
to
pay
that
bill
those
fellows
must
earn
their
weight
in
gold
for
i
saw
my
cousin
give
the
waiter
the
price
of
a
whole
day

work
during
this
monstrous
breakfast

to

nothing
of

gazonal
was
magnificent
in
his
diatribes
against
paris
the
worthy
manufacturer
complained
of
the
length
of
the
the
height
of
the
houses
the
indifference
of
the
passengers
in
the
streets
to
one
another
the
cold
the
rain
the
cost
of
all
of
which
and
much
else
he
bemoaned
in
so
witty
a
manner
that
the
two
artists
took
a
mighty
fancy
to
cousin
gazonal
and
made
him
relate
his
lawsuit
from
beginning
to
end
my
lawsuit
he
said
in
his
southern
accent
and
rolling
his
r

is
a
very
simple
thing
they

manufactory
i

employed
here
in

s
a
slug
who
drives
in
his

while

go
afoot
and
he

yes

replied
gazonal
massol
and
vignon
there
you
have
social
reason
in
which
there
s
no
reason
at
there
must
be
some
way
out
of
it
said
leon
de

you
see
cousin
all
things
are
possible
in
paris
for
good
as
well
as
for
evil
for
the
just
as
well
as
the
unjust
there
s
nothing
that
can
t
be
done
undone
and
the
devil
take
me
if
i
stay
ten
days
more
in
this
hole
of
a
place
the
dullest
in
all
france
the
two
cousins
and
bixiou
were
at
this
moment
walking
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
that
sheet
of
asphalt
on
which
between
the
hours
of
one
and
three
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
seeing
some
of
the
personages
in
honor
of
whom
fame
puts
one
or
the
other
of
her
trumpets
to
her
lips
formerly
that
locality
was
the
place
royale
next
it
was
the
pont
neuf
in
these
days
this
privilege
had
been
acquired
by
the
boulevard
des
italiens
paris
said
the
painter
to
his
cousin
is
an
instrument
on
which
we
must
know
how
to
play
if
we
stand
here
ten
minutes
i
ll
give
you
your
first
lesson
there
look
he
said
raising
his
cane
and
pointing
to
a
couple
who
were
just
then
coming
out
from
the
passage
de
l
opera
goodness
who
s
that
asked
gazonal
was
an
old
woman
in
a
bonnet
which
had
spent
six
months
in
a
a
very
pretentious
gown
and
a
faded
tartan
shawl
whose
face
had
been
buried
twenty
years
of
her
life
in
a
damp
lodge
and
whose
swollen
betokened
no
better
social
position
than
that
of
an
with
her
was
a
slim
little
girl
whose
eyes
fringed
with
black
lashes
had
lost
their
innocence
and
showed
great
weariness
her
face
of
a
pretty
shape
was
fresh
and
her
hair
abundant
her
forehead
charming
but
audacious
her
bust
thin
in
other
words
an
unripe
fruit
that
replied
bixiou

a
rat

to
its
a
rat
what

that
particular
rat
said
leon
with
a
friendly
nod
to
mademoiselle
ninette
may
perhaps
win
your
suit
for
gazonal
bounded
but
bixiou
had
held
him
by
the
arm
ever
since
they
left
the
cafe
thinking
perhaps
that
the
flush
on
his
face
was
rather
vivid
that
rat
who
is
just
leaving
a
rehearsal
at
the
is
going
home
to
eat
a
miserable
dinner
and
will
return
about
three
o
clock
to
dress
if
she
dances
in
the
ballet
this
evening
as
she
will
being
monday
this
rat
is
already
an
old
rat
for
she
is
thirteen
years
of
age
two
years
from
now
that
creature
may
be
worth
sixty
thousand
francs
she
will
be
all
or
nothing
a
great
danseuse
or
a
marcheuse
a
celebrated
person
or
a
vulgar
courtesan
she
has
worked
hard
since
she
was
eight
years
old
such
as
you
see
her
she
is
worn
out
with
fatigue
she
exhausted
her
body
this
morning
in
the
she
is
just
leaving
a
rehearsal
where
the
evolutions
are
as
complicated
as
a
chinese
puzzle
and
she
ll
go
through
them
again
the
rat
is
one
of
the
primary
elements
of
the
opera
she
is
to
the
leading
danseuse
what
a
junior
clerk
is
to
a
notary
the
rat
is
who
produces
the
rat
asked
gazonal
porters
paupers
actors
dancers
replied
bixiou
only
the
lowest
depths
of
poverty
could
force
a
child
to
subject
her
feet
and
joints
to
positive
torture
to
keep
herself
virtuous
out
of
mere
speculation
until
she
is
eighteen
years
of
age
and
to
live
with
some
horrible
old
crone
like
a
beautiful
plant
in
a
dressing
of
manure
you
shall
see
now
a
procession
defiling
before
you
one
after
the
other
of
men
of
talent
little
and
great
artists
in
seed
or
flower
who
are
raising
to
the
glory
of
france
that
monument
called
the
opera
an
assemblage
of
forces
wills
and
forms
of
genius
nowhere
collected
as
in
paris
i
have
already
seen
the
opera
said
gazonal
with
a
air
yes
from
a
seat
among
the
gods
replied
the
landscape
painter
just
as
you
have
seen
paris
in
the
rue
without
knowing
anything
about
it
what
did
they
give
at
the
opera
when
you
were
there
guillaume
well
said
leon
matilde
s
grand
duo
must
have
delighted
you
what
do
you
suppose
that
charming
singer
did
when
she
left
the
stage
she
well
what
she
ate
two
bloody
which
her
servant
had
ready
for
pooh
nonsense
malibran
kept
up
on
brandy
but
it
killed
her
in
the
end
another
thing
you
have
seen
the
ballet
and
you
ll
now
see
it
defiling
past
you
in
its
clothes
without
knowing
that
the
face
of
your
lawsuit
depends
on
a
pair
of
those
my
lawsuit
see
cousin
here
comes
what
is
called
a
leon
pointed
to
one
of
those
handsome
creatures
who
at
years
of
age
have
lived
sixty
and
whose
beauty
is
so
real
and
so
sure
of
being
cultivated
that
they
make
no
display
of
it
she
was
tall
and
walked
well
with
the
arrogant
look
of
a
dandy
her
toilet
was
remarkable
for
its
ruinous
simplicity
that
is
carabine
said
bixiou
who
gave
her
as
did
leon
a
slight
nod
to
which
she
responded
by
a
smile
there
s
another
who
may
possibly
get
your
prefect
turned
a
marcheuse
but
what
is
that
a
marcheuse
is
a
rat
of
great
beauty
whom
her
mother
real
or
fictitious
has
sold
as
soon
as
it
was
clear
she
would
become
neither
first
second
nor
third
danseuse
but
who
prefers
the
occupation
of
coryphee
to
any
other
for
the
main
reason
that
having
spent
her
youth
in
that
employment
she
is
unfitted
for
any
other
she
has
been
rejected
at
the
minor
theatres
where
they
want
danseuses
she
has
not
succeeded
in
the
three
towns
where
ballets
are
given
she
has
not
had
the
money
or
perhaps
the
desire
to
go
to
foreign
countries
for
perhaps
you
don
t
know
that
the
great
school
of
dancing
in
paris
supplies
the
whole
world
with
male
and
female
dancers
thus
a
rat
who
becomes
a
marcheuse
that
is
to
say
an
ordinary
figurante
in
a
ballet
must
have
some
solid
attachment
which
keeps
her
in
paris
either
a
rich
man
she
does
not
love
or
a
poor
man
she
loves
too
well
the
one
you
have
just
seen
pass
will
probably
dress
and
redress
three
times
this
evening
as
a
princess
a
a
tyrolese
by
which
she
will
earn

if
you
should
go
to
her
house
said
bixiou
you
would
find
there
a
a
cook
and
a
she
occupies
a
fine
apartment
in
the
rue
in
short
she
is
in
proportion
to
french
fortunes
of
the
present
day
compared
with
those
of
former
times
a
relic
of
the
eighteenth
century
carabine
is
a
power
at
this
moment
she
governs
du

a
banker
who
is
very
influential
in
the
chamber
of

above
these
two
rounds
in
the
ballet
ladder
what
comes
next
asked
gazonal
look
said
his
cousin
pointing
to
an
elegant
caleche
which
was
turning
at
that
moment
from
the
boulevard
into
the
rue
there
s
one
of
the
leading
danseuses
whose
name
on
the
posters
attracts
all
paris
that
woman
earns
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
lives
like
a
princess
the
price
of
your
manufactory
all
told
wouldn
t
suffice
to
buy
you
the
privilege
of
bidding
her
a
dozen
do
you
see
said
bixiou
that
young
man
who
is
sitting
on
the
front
seat
of
her
carriage
well
he
s
a
viscount
who
bears
a
fine
old
name
he
s
her
first
gentleman
of
the
does
all
her
business
with
the
newspapers
carries
messages
of
peace
or
war
in
the
morning
to
the
director
of
the
opera
and
takes
charge
of
the
applause
which
salutes
her
as
she
enters
or
leaves
the
well
well
my
good
friends
that
s
the
finishing
touch
i
see
now
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
ways
of
at
any
rate
you
are
learning
what
you
can
see
in
ten
minutes
in
the
passage
de
l
opera
said
bixiou
look
two
persons
a
man
and
a
woman
came
out
of
the
passage
at
that
moment
the
woman
was
neither
plain
nor
pretty
but
her
dress
had
that
distinction
of
style
and
cut
and
color
which
reveals
an
artist
the
man
had
the
air
of
a
singer
there
said
bixiou
is
a
baritone
and
a
second
danseuse
the
baritone
is
a
man
of
immense
talent
but
a
baritone
voice
being
only
an
accessory
to
the
other
parts
he
scarcely
earns
what
the
second
danseuse
earns
the
danseuse
who
was
celebrated
before
taglioni
and
ellsler
appeared
has
preserved
to
our
day
some
of
the
old
traditions
of
the
character
dance
and
pantomime
if
the
two
others
had
not
revealed
in
the
art
of
dancing
a
poetry
hitherto
unperceived
she
would
have
been
the
leading
talent
as
it
is
she
is
reduced
to
the
second
line
but
for
all
that
she
fingers
her
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
her
faithful
friend
is
a
peer
of
france
very
influential
in
the
chamber
and
see
there
s
a
danseuse
of
the
third
order
who
as
a
dancer
exists
only
through
the
omnipotence
of
a
newspaper
if
her
engagement
were
not
renewed
the
ministry
would
have
one
more
journalistic
enemy
on
its
back
the
corps
de
ballet
is
a
great
power
consequently
it
is
considered
better
form
in
the
upper
ranks
of
dandyism
and
politics
to
have
relations
with
dance
than
with
song
in
the
stalls
where
the
habitues
of
the
opera
congregate
the
saying
monsieur
is
all
for
singing
is
a
form
of
a
short
man
with
a
common
face
quite
simply
dressed
passed
them
at
this
moment
there
s
the
other
half
of
the
opera
receipts
that
man
who
just
went
by
the
tenor
there
is
no
longer
any
play
poem
music
or
representation
of
any
kind
possible
unless
some
celebrated
tenor
can
reach
a
certain
note
the
tenor
is
love
he
is
the
voice
that
touches
the
heart
that
vibrates
in
the
soul
and
his
value
is
reckoned
at
a
much
higher
salary
than
that
of
a
minister
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
a
throat
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
a
couple
of
those
are
the
two
financial
scourges
of
the
i
am
amazed
said
gazonal
at
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
walking
about
we
ll
amaze
you
a
good
deal
more
my
dear
cousin
said
leon
de
lora
we
ll
take
paris
as
an
artist
takes
his
violoncello
and
show
you
how
it
is
played
in
short
how
people
amuse
themselves
in
it
is
a
kaleidoscope
with
a
circumference
of
twenty
miles
cried
gazonal
before
piloting
monsieur
about
i
have
to
see
gaillard
said
bixiou
but
we
can
use
gaillard
for
the
cousin
replied
leon
what
sort
of
machine
is
that
asked
gazonal
he
isn
t
a
machine
he
is
a
machinist
gaillard
is
a
friend
of
ours
who
has
ended
a
miscellaneous
career
by
becoming
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
and
whose
character
and
finances
are
governed
by
movements
comparable
to
those
of
the
tides
gaillard
can
contribute
to
make
you
win
your
lawsuit
it
is
that
s
the
very
moment
to
win
it
replied
bixiou
when
they
reached
theodore
gaillard
s
abode
which
was
now
in
the
rue
de
menars
the
valet
ushered
the
three
friends
into
a
boudoir
and
asked
them
to
wait
as
monsieur
was
in
secret
conference
with
whom
asked
bixiou
with
a
man
who
is
selling
him
the
incarceration
of
an
debtor
replied
a
handsome
woman
who
now
appeared
in
a
charming
morning
toilet
in
that
case
my
dear
suzanne
said
bixiou
i
am
certain
we
may
go
oh
what
a
beautiful
creature
said
gazonal
that
is
madame
gaillard
replied
leon
de
lora
speaking
low
into
his
cousin
s
ear
she
is
the
most
woman
in
paris
for
she
had
the
public
and
has
contented
herself
with
a
what
is
your
will
messeigneurs
said
the
facetious
editor
seeing
his
two
friends
and
imitating
frederic
lemaitre
theodore
gaillard
formerly
a
wit
had
ended
by
becoming
a
stupid
man
in
consequence
of
remaining
constantly
in
one
centre
a
moral
phenomenon
frequently
to
be
observed
in
paris
his
principal
method
of
conversation
consisted
in
sowing
his
speeches
with
sayings
taken
from
plays
then
in
vogue
and
pronounced
in
imitation
of
actors
we
have
come
to
blague
said
leon
again
young
men
odry
in
the
saltimbauques
well
this
time
we
ve
got
him
sure
said
gaillard
s
other
visitor
apparently
by
way
of
conclusion
you
sure
of
it
pere
fromenteau
asked
gaillard
this
it
the
eleventh
time
you
ve
caught
him
at
night
and
missed
him
in
the
how
could
i
help
it
i
never
saw
such
a
debtor
he
s
a
locomotive
goes
to
sleep
in
paris
and
wakes
up
in
the
a
safety
lock
i
call
seeing
a
smile
on
gaillard
s
face
he
added
that
s
a
saying
in
our
business
pinch
a
man
means
arrest
him
lock
him
up
the
criminal
police
have
another
term
vidoeq
said
to
his
man
you
are
served
that
s
funnier
for
it
means
the
a
nudge
from
bixiou
made
gazonal
all
eyes
and
ears
does
monsieur
grease
my
paws
asked
fromenteau
of
gaillard
in
a
threatening
but
cool
tone
a
question
that
of
fifty
centimes
les
saltimbauques
replied
the
editor
taking
out
five
francs
and
offering
them
to
fromenteau
and
the
rapscallions
said
the
man
what
rapscallions
asked
gaillard
those
i
employ
replied
fromenteau
calmly
is
there
a
lower
depth
still
asked
bixiou
yes
monsieur
said
the
spy
some
people
give
us
information
without
knowing
they
do
so
and
without
getting
paid
for
it
i
put
fools
and
ninnies
below
they
are
often
original
and
witty
your
rapscallions
said
leon
do
you
belong
to
the
police
asked
gazonal
eying
with
uneasy
curiosity
the
hard
impassible
little
man
who
was
dressed
like
the
third
clerk
in
a
sheriff
s
office
which
police
do
you
mean
asked
fromenteau
there
are
several
as
many
as
five
replied
the
man
criminal
the
head
of
which
was
vidoeq
secret
police
which
keeps
an
eye
on
the
other
police
the
head
of
it
being
always
unknown
political
police
that
s
fouche
s
then
there
s
the
police
of
foreign
affairs
and
finally
the
palace
police
of
the
emperor
louis
etc
always
squabbling
with
that
of
the
quai
malaquais
it
came
to
an
end
under
monsieur
decazes
i
belonged
to
the
police
of
louis
xviii
i
d
been
in
it
since
with
that
poor
the
four
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
with
one
thought
how
many
heads
he
must
have
brought
to
the
scaffold
they
are
trying
to
get
on
without
us
folly
continued
the
little
man
who
began
to
seem
terrible
since
they
want
honest
men
at
the
prefecture
i
resigned
and
i
ve
made
myself
a
small
vocation
by
arresting
for
he
is
the
right
arm
of
the
commercial
police
said
gaillard
in
bixiou
s
ear
but
you
can
never
find
out
who
pays
him
most
the
debtor
or
the
the
more
rascally
a
business
is
the
more
honor
it
needs
i
m
for
him
who
pays
me
best
continued
fromenteau
addressing
gaillard
you
want
to
recover
fifty
thousand
francs
and
you
talk
farthings
to
your
means
of
action
give
me
five
hundred
francs
and
your
man
is
pinched
for
we
spotted
him
yesterday
five
hundred
francs
for
you
alone
cried
theodore
gaillard
lizette
wants
a
shawl
said
the
spy
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moving
i
call
her
lizette
because
of
you
have
a
lizette
and
you
stay
in
such
a
business
cried
the
virtuous
gazonal
it
is
amusing
people
may
cry
up
the
pleasures
of
hunting
and
fishing
as
much
as
they
like
but
to
stalk
a
man
in
paris
is
far
better
certainly
said
gazonal
reflectively
speaking
to
himself
they
must
have
great
if
i
were
to
enumerate
the
qualities
which
make
a
man
remarkable
in
our
vocation
said
fromenteau
whose
rapid
glance
had
enabled
him
to
fathom
gazonal
completely
you
d
think
i
was
talking
of
a
man
of
genius
first
we
must
have
the
eyes
of
a
lynx
next
audacity
to
tear
into
houses
like
bombs
accost
the
servants
as
if
we
knew
them
and
propose
treachery
always
agreed
to
next
memory
sagacity
invention
to
make
schemes
conceived
rapidly
never
the
same
for
spying
must
be
guided
by
the
characters
and
habits
of
the
persons
spied
upon
it
is
a
gift
of
heaven
and
finally
agility
vigor
all
these
facilities
and
qualities
monsieur
are
depicted
on
the
door
of
the
as
virtue
well
we
must
have
them
all
under
pain
of
losing
the
salaries
given
us
by
the
state
the
rue
de
jerusalem
or
the
minister
of
you
certainly
seem
to
me
a
remarkable
man
said
gazonal
fromenteau
looked
at
the
provincial
without
replying
without
betraying
the
smallest
sign
of
feeling
and
departed
bowing
to
no
one
a
trait
of
real
genius
well
cousin
you
have
now
seen
the
police
incarnate
said
leon
to
gazonal
it
has
something
the
effect
of
a
said
the
worthy
provincial
while
gaillard
and
bixiou
were
talking
together
in
a
low
voice
i
ll
give
you
an
answer
at
carabine
s
said
gaillard
aloud
himself
at
his
desk
without
seeing
or
bowing
to
gazonal
he
is
a
rude
fellow
cried
the
southerner
as
they
left
the
room
his
paper
has
thousand
subscribers
said
leon
de
lora
he
is
one
of
the
five
great
powers
of
the
day
and
he
hasn
t
in
the
morning
the
time
to
be
polite
now
continued
leon
speaking
to
bixiou
if
we
are
going
to
the
chamber
to
help
him
with
his
lawsuit
let
us
take
the
longest
way
words
said
by
great
men
are
like
spoons
with
the
gilt
washed
off
by
dint
of
repetition
they
lose
their
brilliancy
said
bixiou
where
shall
we
go
here
close
by
to
our
hatter
replied
leon
bravo
cried
bixiou
if
we
keep
on
in
this
way
we
shall
have
an
amusing
day
of
gazonal
said
leon
i
shall
make
the
man
pose
for
you
but
mind
that
you
keep
a
serious
face
like
the
king
on
a
piece
for
you
are
going
to
see
a
choice
original
a
man
whose
importance
has
turned
his
head
in
these
days
my
dear
fellow
under
our
new
political
dispensation
every
human
being
tries
to
cover
himself
with
glory
and
most
of
them
cover
themselves
with
ridicule
hence
a
lot
of
living
caricatures
quite
new
to
the
if
everybody
gets
glory
who
can
be
famous
said
gazonal
fame
none
but
fools
want
that
replied
bixiou
your
cousin
wears
the
cross
but
i
m
the
better
dressed
of
the
two
and
it
is
i
whom
people
are
looking
after
this
remark
which
may
explain
why
orators
and
other
great
statesmen
no
longer
put
the
ribbon
in
their
buttonholes
when
in
paris
leon
showed
gazonal
a
sign
bearing
in
golden
letters
the
illustrious
name
of
vital
successor
to
finot
manufacturer
of
hats
no
longer
hatter
as
formerly
whose
advertisements
brought
in
more
money
to
the
newspapers
than
those
of
any
vendors
of
pills
or
sugarplums
the
author
moreover
of
an
essay
on
hats
my
dear
fellow
said
bixiou
to
gazonal
pointing
to
the
splendors
of
the
vital
has
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
from
invested
and
he
stays
a
hatter
cried
the
southerner
with
a
bound
that
almost
broke
the
arm
which
bixiou
had
linked
in
his
you
shall
see
the
man
said
leon
you
need
a
hat
and
you
shall
have
one
is
monsieur
vital
absent
asked
bixiou
seeing
no
one
behind
the
desk
monsieur
is
correcting
proof
in
his
study
replied
the
head
clerk
hein
what
style
said
leon
to
his
cousin
then
he
added
addressing
the
clerk
could
we
speak
to
him
without
injury
to
his
inspiration
let
those
gentlemen
enter
said
a
voice
it
was
a
bourgeois
voice
the
voice
of
one
eligible
to
the
chamber
a
powerful
voice
a
wealthy
voice
vital
deigned
to
show
himself
dressed
entirely
in
black
cloth
with
a
splendid
frilled
shirt
adorned
with
one
diamond
the
three
friends
observed
a
young
and
pretty
woman
sitting
near
the
desk
working
at
some
embroidery
vital
is
a
man
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
with
a
natural
joviality
now
repressed
by
ambitious
ideas
he
is
blessed
with
that
medium
height
which
is
the
privilege
of
sound
organizations
he
is
rather
plump
and
takes
great
pains
with
his
person
his
forehead
is
getting
bald
but
he
uses
that
circumstance
to
give
himself
the
air
of
a
man
consumed
by
thought
it
is
easy
to
see
by
the
way
his
wife
looks
at
him
and
listens
to
him
that
she
believes
in
the
genius
and
glory
of
her
husband
vital
loves
artists
not
that
he
has
any
taste
for
art
but
from
fellowship
for
he
feels
himself
an
artist
and
makes
this
felt
by
disclaiming
that
title
of
nobility
and
placing
himself
with
constant
premeditation
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
arts
that
persons
may
be
forced
to
say
to
him
you
have
raised
the
construction
of
hats
to
the
height
of
a
have
you
at
last
discovered
a
hat
to
suit
me
asked
leon
de
lora
why
monsieur
in
fifteen
days
replied
vital
and
for
you
two
months
would
hardly
suffice
to
invent
a
shape
in
keeping
with
your
countenance
see
here
is
your
lithographic
portrait
i
have
studied
it
most
carefully
i
would
not
give
myself
that
trouble
for
a
prince
but
you
are
more
you
are
an
artist
and
you
understand
this
is
one
of
our
greatest
inventors
said
bixiou
presenting
gazonal
he
might
be
as
great
as
jacquart
if
he
would
only
let
himself
die
our
friend
a
manufacturer
of
cloth
has
discovered
a
method
of
replacing
the
indigo
in
old
blue
coats
and
he
wants
to
see
you
as
another
great
phenomenon
because
he
has
heard
of
your
saying
the
hat
is
the
that
speech
of
yours
enraptured
him
ah
vital
you
have
faith
you
believe
in
something
you
have
enthusiasm
for
your
vital
scarcely
listened
he
grew
pale
with
pleasure
rise
my
wife
monsieur
is
a
man
of
madame
vital
rose
at
her
husband
s
gesture
gazonal
bowed
to
her
shall
i
have
the
honor
to
cover
your
head
said
vital
with
joyful
obsequiousness
at
the
same
price
as
mine
interposed
bixiou
of
course
of
course
i
ask
no
other
fee
than
to
be
quoted
by
you
messieurs
monsieur
needs
a
picturesque
hat
something
in
the
style
of
monsieur
lousteau
s
he
continued
looking
at
gazonal
with
the
eye
of
a
master
i
will
consider
you
give
yourself
a
great
deal
of
trouble
said
gazonal
oh
for
a
few
persons
only
for
those
who
know
how
to
appreciate
the
value
of
the
pains
i
bestow
upon
them
now
take
the
aristocracy
there
is
but
one
man
there
who
has
truly
comprehended
the
hat
and
that
is
the
prince
de
bethune
how
is
it
that
men
do
not
consider
as
women
do
that
the
hat
is
the
first
thing
that
strikes
the
eye
and
why
have
they
never
thought
of
changing
the
present
system
which
is
let
us
say
it
frankly
ignoble
yes
ignoble
and
yet
a
frenchman
is
of
all
nationalities
the
one
most
persistent
in
this
folly
i
know
the
difficulties
of
a
change
messieurs
i
don
t
speak
of
my
own
writings
on
the
matter
which
as
i
think
approach
it
philosophically
but
simply
as
a
hatter
i
have
myself
studied
means
to
accentuate
the
infamous
to
which
france
is
now
enslaved
until
i
succeed
in
overthrowing
so
saying
he
pointed
to
the
hideous
hat
in
vogue
at
the
present
day
behold
the
enemy
messieurs
he
continued
how
is
it
that
the
wittiest
and
most
satirical
people
on
earth
will
consent
to
wear
upon
their
heads
a
bit
of
as
one
of
our
great
writers
has
called
it
here
are
some
of
the
infections
i
have
been
able
to
give
to
those
atrocious
lines
he
added
pointing
to
a
number
of
his
creations
but
although
i
am
able
to
conform
them
to
the
character
of
each
wearer
for
as
you
see
there
are
the
hats
of
a
doctor
a
grocer
a
dandy
an
artist
a
fat
man
a
thin
man
and
so
forth
the
style
itself
remains
horrible
seize
i
beg
of
you
my
whole
thought
he
took
up
a
hat
and
this
he
continued
is
the
old
hat
of
claude
vignon
a
great
critic
in
the
days
when
he
was
a
free
man
and
a
he
has
lately
come
round
to
the
ministry
they
ve
made
him
a
professor
a
librarian
he
writes
now
for
the
debats
only
they
ve
appointed
him
master
of
petitions
with
a
salary
of
sixteen
thousand
francs
he
earns
four
thousand
more
out
of
his
paper
and
he
is
decorated
well
now
see
his
new
and
vital
showed
them
a
hat
of
a
form
and
design
which
was
truly
expressive
of
the
you
ought
to
have
made
him
a
punch
and
judy
hat
cried
gazonal
you
are
a
man
of
genius
monsieur
vital
said
leon
vital
bowed
would
you
kindly
tell
me
why
the
shops
of
your
trade
in
paris
remain
open
late
at
night
later
than
the
cafes
and
the
wineshops
that
fact
puzzles
me
very
much
said
gazonal
in
the
first
place
our
shops
are
much
finer
when
lighted
up
than
they
are
in
the
daytime
next
where
we
sell
ten
hats
in
the
daytime
we
sell
fifty
at
everything
is
queer
in
paris
said
leon
thanks
to
my
efforts
and
my
successes
said
vital
returning
to
the
course
of
his
we
are
coming
to
hats
with
round
headpieces
it
is
to
that
i
tend
what
obstacle
is
there
asked
gazonal
cheapness
monsieur
in
the
first
place
very
handsome
silk
hats
can
be
built
for
fifteen
francs
which
kills
our
business
for
in
paris
no
one
ever
has
fifteen
francs
in
his
pocket
to
spend
on
a
hat
if
a
beaver
hat
costs
thirty
it
is
still
the
same
thing
when
i
say
beaver
i
ought
to
state
that
there
are
not
ten
pounds
of
beaver
skins
left
in
france
that
article
is
worth
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
pound
and
it
takes
an
ounce
for
a
hat
besides
a
beaver
hat
isn
t
really
worth
anything
the
skin
takes
a
wretched
dye
gets
rusty
in
ten
minutes
under
the
sun
and
heat
puts
it
out
of
shape
as
well
what
we
call
beaver
in
the
trade
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
hare
the
best
qualities
are
made
from
the
back
of
the
animal
the
second
from
the
sides
the
third
from
the
belly
i
confide
to
you
these
trade
secrets
because
you
are
men
of
honor
but
whether
a
man
has
hare
or
silk
on
his
head
fifteen
or
thirty
francs
in
short
the
problem
is
always
insoluble
hats
must
be
paid
for
in
cash
and
that
is
why
the
hat
remains
what
it
is
the
honor
of
vestural
france
will
be
saved
on
the
day
that
gray
hats
with
round
crowns
can
be
made
to
cost
a
hundred
francs
we
could
then
like
the
tailors
give
credit
to
reach
that
result
men
must
resolve
to
wear
buckles
gold
lace
plumes
and
the
brims
lined
with
satin
as
in
the
days
of
louis
xiii
and
louis
xiv
our
business
which
would
then
enter
the
domain
of
fancy
would
increase
tenfold
the
markets
of
the
world
should
belong
to
france
paris
will
forever
give
the
tone
to
women
s
fashions
and
yet
the
hats
which
all
frenchmen
wear
are
made
in
every
country
on
earth
there
are
ten
millions
of
foreign
money
to
be
gained
annually
for
france
in
that
question
a
revolution
cried
bixiou
pretending
enthusiasm
yes
and
a
radical
one
for
the
form
must
be
you
are
happy
after
the
manner
of
luther
in
dreaming
of
reform
said
leon
yes
monsieur
ah
if
a
dozen
or
fifteen
artists
capitalists
or
dandies
who
set
the
tone
would
only
have
courage
for
hours
france
would
gain
a
splendid
commercial
battle
to
succeed
in
this
reform
i
would
give
my
whole
fortune
yes
my
sole
ambition
is
to
regenerate
the
hat
and
the
man
is
colossal
said
gazonal
as
they
left
the
shop
but
i
assure
you
that
all
your
originals
so
far
have
a
touch
of
the
southerner
about
let
us
go
this
way
said
bixiou
pointing
to
the
rue
do
you
want
to
show
me
something
else
yes
you
shall
see
the
usuress
of
rats
marcheuses
and
great
ladies
a
woman
who
possesses
more
terrible
secrets
than
there
are
gowns
hanging
in
her
window
said
bixiou
and
he
showed
gazonal
one
of
those
untidy
shops
which
made
an
ugly
stain
in
the
midst
of
the
dazzling
of
modern
retail
commerce
this
shop
had
a
front
painted
in
which
some
bankrupt
had
doubtless
left
in
a
dilapidated
condition
the
color
had
disappeared
beneath
a
double
coating
of
dirt
the
result
of
usage
and
a
thick
layer
of
dust
the
were
filthy
the
turned
of
itself
as
do
in
all
places
where
people
go
out
more
quickly
than
they
enter
what
do
you
say
of
first
cousin
to
death
isn
t
she
said
leon
in
gazonal
s
ear
showing
him
at
the
desk
a
terrible
individual
well
she
calls
herself
madame
madame
how
much
is
this
guipure
asked
the
manufacturer
intending
to
compete
in
liveliness
with
the
two
artists
to
you
monsieur
who
come
from
the
country
it
will
be
only
three
hundred
francs
she
replied
then
remarking
in
his
manner
a
sort
of
eagerness
peculiar
to
southerners
she
added
in
a
grieved
tone
it
formerly
belonged
to
that
poor
princess
de
what
do
you
dare
exhibit
it
so
near
the
palace
cried
bixiou
monsieur
don
t
believe
in
it
she
replied
madame
we
have
not
come
to
make
purchases
said
bixiou
with
a
show
of
frankness
so
i
see
monsieur
returned
madame
nourrisson
we
have
several
things
to
sell
said
the
illustrious
caricaturist
i
live
close
by
rue
de
richelieu
sixth
floor
if
you
will
come
round
there
for
a
moment
you
may
perhaps
make
some
good
ten
minutes
later
madame
nourrisson
did
in
fact
present
herself
at
bixiou
s
lodgings
where
by
that
time
he
had
taken
leon
and
gazonal
madame
nourrisson
found
them
all
three
as
serious
as
authors
whose
collaboration
does
not
meet
with
the
success
it
deserves
madame
said
the
intrepid
hoaxer
showing
her
a
pair
of
women
s
slippers
these
belonged
formerly
to
the
empress
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
return
change
for
the
prince
de
lamballe
those
she
exclaimed
they
were
made
this
year
look
at
the
don
t
you
perceive
that
the
slippers
are
only
by
way
of
preface
said
leon
though
to
be
sure
they
are
usually
the
conclusion
of
a
my
friend
here
said
bixiou
motioning
to
gazonal
has
an
immense
family
interest
in
ascertaining
whether
a
young
lady
of
a
good
and
wealthy
house
whom
he
wishes
to
marry
has
ever
gone
how
much
will
monsieur
give
for
the
information
she
asked
looking
at
gazonal
who
was
no
longer
surprised
by
anything
one
hundred
francs
he
said
no
thank
you
she
said
with
a
grimace
of
refusal
worthy
of
a
macaw
then
say
how
much
you
want
my
little
madame
nourrisson
cried
bixiou
catching
her
round
the
waist
in
the
first
place
my
dear
gentlemen
i
have
never
since
i
ve
been
in
the
business
found
man
or
woman
to
haggle
over
happiness
besides
she
said
letting
a
cold
smile
flicker
on
her
lips
and
enforcing
it
by
an
icy
glance
full
of
catlike
distrust
if
it
doesn
t
concern
your
happiness
it
concerns
your
fortune
and
at
the
height
where
i
find
you
lodging
no
man
haggles
over
a
dot
come
she
said
out
with
it
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
my
lambs
about
the
beunier
family
replied
bixiou
very
glad
to
find
out
something
in
this
indirect
manner
about
persons
in
whom
he
was
interested
oh
as
for
that
she
said
one
louis
is
quite
why
because
i
hold
all
the
mother
s
jewels
and
she
s
on
every
three
months
i
can
tell
you
it
is
hard
work
for
her
to
pay
the
interest
on
what
i
ve
lent
her
do
you
want
to
marry
there
simpleton
she
added
addressing
gazonal
then
pay
me
forty
francs
and
i
ll
talk
four
hundred
gazonal
produced
a
and
madame
nourrisson
gave
him
startling
details
as
to
the
secret
penury
of
certain
fashionable
women
this
dealer
in
clothes
getting
lively
as
she
talked
pictured
herself
unconsciously
while
telling
of
others
without
betraying
a
single
name
or
any
secret
she
made
the
three
men
shudder
by
proving
to
them
how
little
happiness
existed
in
paris
that
did
not
rest
on
the
vacillating
foundation
of
borrowed
money
she
possessed
laid
away
in
her
drawers
the
secrets
of
departed
grandmothers
living
children
deceased
husbands
dead
granddaughters
memories
set
in
gold
and
diamonds
she
learned
appalling
stories
by
making
her
clients
talk
of
one
another
tearing
their
secrets
from
them
in
moments
of
passion
of
quarrels
of
anger
and
during
those
cooler
negotiations
which
need
a
loan
to
settle
difficulties
why
were
you
ever
induced
to
take
up
such
a
business
asked
gazonal
for
my
son
s
sake
she
said
naively
such
women
almost
invariably
justify
their
trade
by
alleging
noble
motives
madame
nourrisson
posed
as
having
lost
several
opportunities
for
marriage
also
three
daughters
who
had
gone
to
the
bad
and
all
her
illusions
she
showed
the
of
the
to
prove
the
risks
her
business
ran
declared
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
meet
the
end
of
the
month
she
was
robbed
she
said
the
two
artists
looked
at
each
other
on
hearing
that
expression
which
seemed
exaggerated
look
here
my
sons
i
ll
show
you
how
we
are
it
is
not
about
myself
but
about
my
opposite
neighbour
madame
mahuchet
a
ladies
shoemaker
i
had
loaned
money
to
a
countess
a
woman
who
has
too
many
passions
for
her
means
lives
in
a
fine
apartment
filled
with
splendid
furniture
and
makes
as
we
say
a
devil
of
a
show
with
her
high
and
mighty
airs
she
owed
three
hundred
francs
to
her
shoemaker
and
was
giving
a
dinner
no
later
than
yesterday
the
shoemaker
who
heard
of
the
dinner
from
the
cook
came
to
see
me
we
got
excited
and
she
wanted
to
make
a
row
but
i
said
my
dear
madame
mahuchet
what
good
will
that
do
you
ll
only
get
yourself
hated
it
is
much
better
to
obtain
some
security
and
you
save
your
she
wouldn
t
listen
but
go
she
would
and
asked
me
to
support
her
so
i
went
madame
is
not
at
up
to
that
we
ll
wait
said
madame
mahuchet
if
we
have
to
stay
all
night
and
down
we
camped
in
the
antechamber
presently
the
doors
began
to
open
and
shut
and
feet
and
voices
came
along
i
felt
badly
the
guests
were
arriving
for
dinner
you
can
see
the
appearance
it
had
the
countess
sent
her
maid
to
coax
madame
mahuchet
pay
you
in
short
all
the
snares
nothing
took
the
countess
dressed
to
the
nines
went
to
the
mahuchet
heard
her
and
opened
the
door
gracious
when
she
saw
that
table
sparkling
with
silver
the
covers
to
the
dishes
and
the
chandeliers
all
glittering
like
a
didn
t
she
go
off
like
and
fire
her
shot
when
people
spend
the
money
of
others
they
should
be
sober
and
not
give
think
of
your
being
a
countess
and
owing
three
hundred
francs
to
a
poor
shoemaker
with
seven
children
you
can
guess
how
she
railed
for
the
mahuchet
hasn
t
any
education
when
the
countess
tried
to
make
an
excuse
no
money
mahuchet
screamed
out
look
at
all
your
fine
silver
madame
pawn
it
and
pay
me
take
some
yourself
said
the
countess
quickly
gathering
up
a
quantity
of
forks
and
spoons
and
putting
them
into
her
hands
downstairs
we
rattled
heavens
like
success
itself
no
before
we
got
to
the
street
mahuchet
began
to
cry
she
s
a
kind
woman
she
turned
back
and
restored
the
silver
for
she
now
understood
that
countess
poverty
it
was
plated
ware
and
she
forked
it
over
said
leon
in
whom
the
former
mistigris
occasionally
reappeared
ah
my
dear
monsieur
said
madame
nourrisson
enlightened
by
the
slang
you
are
an
artist
you
write
plays
you
live
in
the
rue
du
helder
and
are
friends
with
madame
anatolia
you
have
habits
that
i
know
all
about
come
do
you
want
some
rarity
in
the
grand
style
carabine
or
mousqueton
malaga
or
jenny
cadine
malaga
carabine
nonsense
cried
leon
de
lora
it
was
we
who
invented
i
assure
you
my
good
madame
nourrisson
said
bixiou
that
we
only
wanted
the
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
and
we
should
like
very
much
to
be
informed
as
to
how
you
ever
came
to
slip
into
this
i
was
confidential
maid
in
the
family
of
a
marshal
of
france
prince
d
ysembourg
she
said
assuming
the
airs
of
a
dorine
one
morning
one
of
the
most
beplumed
countesses
of
the
imperial
court
came
to
the
house
and
wanted
to
speak
to
the
marshal
privately
i
put
myself
in
the
way
of
hearing
what
she
said
she
burst
into
tears
and
confided
to
that
booby
of
a
marshal
yes
the
conde
of
the
republic
is
a
booby
that
her
husband
who
served
under
him
in
spain
had
left
her
without
means
and
if
she
didn
t
get
a
thousand
francs
or
two
thousand
that
day
her
children
must
go
without
food
she
hadn
t
any
for
the
morrow
the
marshal
who
was
always
ready
to
give
in
those
days
took
two
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
out
of
his
desk
and
gave
them
to
her
i
saw
that
fine
countess
going
down
the
staircase
where
she
couldn
t
see
me
she
was
laughing
with
a
satisfaction
that
certainly
wasn
t
motherly
so
i
slipped
after
her
to
the
peristyle
where
i
heard
her
say
to
the
coachman
to
leroy
i
ran
round
quickly
to
leroy
s
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
poor
mother
i
got
there
in
time
to
see
her
order
and
pay
for
a
dress
you
understand
that
in
those
days
people
were
made
to
pay
when
they
bought
the
next
day
but
one
she
appeared
at
an
ambassador
s
ball
dressed
to
please
all
the
world
and
some
one
in
particular
that
day
i
said
to
myself
i
ve
got
a
career
when
i
m
no
longer
young
i
ll
lend
money
to
great
ladies
on
their
finery
for
passion
never
calculates
it
pays
if
you
want
subjects
for
a
vaudeville
i
can
sell
you
she
departed
after
delivering
this
tirade
in
which
all
the
phases
of
her
past
life
were
outlined
leaving
gazonal
as
much
horrified
by
her
revelations
as
by
the
five
yellow
teeth
she
showed
when
she
tried
to
smile
what
shall
we
do
now
he
asked
presently
make
notes
replied
bixiou
whistling
for
his
porter
for
i
want
some
money
and
i
ll
show
you
the
use
of
porters
you
think
they
only
pull
the
whereas
they
really
pull
poor
devils
like
me
and
artists
whom
they
take
under
their
protection
out
of
difficulties
mine
will
get
the
montyon

one
of
these

his
eyes
to
their
utmost
roundness
a
man
between
two
ages
partly
a
graybeard
partly
an

more
oily

and
without
hair
greasy
stomach
puffy
skin
dull
and
moist
like
that
of
the
prior
of
a
convent
always
wearing
list
shoes
a
blue
coat
and
grayish
trousers
made
his
appearance
what
is
it
monsieur
he
said
with
an
air
which
combined
that
of
a
protector
and
a
subordinate
ravenouillet
his
name
is
ravenouillet
said
bixiou
turning
to
gazonal
have
you
our
notebook
of
bills
due
with
you
ravenouillet
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
the
greasiest
and
stickiest
book
that
gazonal
s
eyes
had
ever
beheld
write
down
at
three
months
sight
two
notes
of
five
hundred
francs
each
which
you
will
proceed
to
and
bixiou
handed
over
two
notes
already
drawn
to
his
order
by
ravenouillet
which
ravenouillet
immediately
signed
and
inscribed
on
the
greasy
book
in
which
his
wife
also
kept
account
of
the
debts
of
the
other
lodgers
thanks
ravenouillet
said
bixiou
and
here
s
a
box
at
the
vaudeville
for
oh
my
daughter
will
enjoy

said
ravenouillet
departing
there
are
tenants
in
this
house
said
bixiou
and
the
average
of
what
they
owe
ravenouillet
is
six
thousand
francs
a
month
eighteen
thousand

for
money

not
counting
the

at

we
all
pay

though
he
never
asks
for

paris
cried
gazonal
i
m
going
to
take
you
now
cousin
gazonal
said
bixiou
after
indorsing
the
notes
to
see
another
comedian
who
will
play
you
a
charming
scene
who
is
it
said
gazonal
a
usurer
as
we
go
along
i
ll
tell
you
the
debut
of
friend
ravenouillet
in
passing
in
front
of
the
porter
s
lodge
gazonal
saw
mademoiselle
lucienne
ravenouillet
holding
in
her
hand
a
music
score
she
was
a
pupil
of
the
conservatoire
her
father
reading
a
newspaper
and
madame
ravenouillet
with
a
package
of
letters
to
be
carried
up
to
the
lodgers
thanks
monsieur
bixiou
said
the
girl
she
s
not
a
rat
explained
leon
to
his
cousin
she
is
the
larva
of
the
here
s
the
history
of
ravenouillet
continued
bixiou
when
the
three
friends
reached
the
boulevard
in
massol
the
councillor
of
state
who
is
dealing
with
your
case
was
a
who
at
that
time
never
thought
of
being
more
than
keeper
of
the
seals
and
deigned
to
have
king
on
his
throne
forgive
his
ambition
he
s
from
carcassonne
one
morning
there
entered
to
him
a
young
rustic
of
his
parts
who
said
you
know
me
very
well
mossoo
massol
i
m
your
neighbour
the
grocer
s
little
boy
i
ve
come
from
down
there
for
they
tell
me
a
fellow
is
certain
to
get
a
place
if
he
comes
to
hearing
these
words
massol
shuddered
and
said
to
himself
that
if
he
were
weak
enough
to
help
this
compatriot
to
him
utterly
unknown
he
should
have
the
whole
department
prone
upon
him
his
would
break
his
valet
leave
him
he
should
have
difficulties
with
his
landlord
about
the
stairway
and
the
other
lodgers
would
assuredly
complain
of
the
smell
of
garlic
pervading
the
house
consequently
he
looked
at
his
visitor
as
a
butcher
looks
at
a
sheep
whose
throat
he
intends
to
cut
but
whether
the
rustic
comprehended
the
stab
of
that
glance
or
not
he
went
on
to
say
so
massol
told
me
i
ve
as
much
ambition
as
other
men
i
will
never
go
back
to
my
native
place
if
i
ever
do
go
back
unless
i
am
a
rich
man
paris
is
the
antechamber
of
paradise
they
tell
me
that
you
who
write
the
newspapers
can
make
as
they
say
fine
weather
and
foul
that
is
you
have
things
all
your
own
way
and
it
s
enough
to
ask
your
help
to
get
any
place
no
matter
what
under
government
now
though
i
have
faculties
like
others
i
know
myself
i
have
no
education
i
don
t
know
how
to
write
and
that
s
a
misfortune
for
i
have
ideas
i
am
not
seeking
therefore
to
be
your
rival
i
judge
myself
and
i
know
i
couldn
t
succeed
there
but
as
you
are
so
powerful
and
as
we
are
almost
brothers
having
played
together
in
childhood
i
count
upon
you
to
launch
me
in
a
career
and
to
protect
me
oh
you
i
want
a
place
a
place
suitable
to
my
capacity
to
such
as
i
am
a
place
were
i
can
make
my
massol
was
just
about
to
put
his
compatriot
neck
and
crop
out
of
the
door
with
some
brutal
speech
when
the
rustic
ended
his
appeal
thus
i
don
t
ask
to
enter
the
administration
where
people
advance
like
tortoises
there
s
your
cousin
who
has
stuck
in
one
post
for
twenty
years
no
i
only
want
to
make
my
on
the
stage
asked
massol
only
too
happy
at
that
no
though
i
have
gesture
enough
and
figure
and
memory
but
there
s
too
much
wear
and
tear
i
prefer
the
career
of
massol
kept
his
countenance
and
replied
i
think
there
s
more
wear
and
tear
in
that
but
as
your
choice
is
made
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
and
he
got
him
as
ravenouillet
says
his
first
i
was
the
first
master
said
leon
to
consider
the
race
of
porter
you
ll
find
knaves
of
morality
mountebanks
of
vanity
modern
sycophants
septembriseurs
disguised
in
philanthropy
inventors
of
palpitating
questions
preaching
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
improvement
of
little
thieves
benevolence
to
liberated
convicts
and
who
nevertheless
leave
their
porters
in
a
condition
worse
than
that
of
the
irish
in
holes
more
dreadful
than
a
mud
cabin
and
pay
them
less
money
to
live
on
than
the
state
pays
to
support
a
convict
i
have
done
but
one
good
action
in
my
life
and
that
was
to
build
my
porter
a
decent
yes
said
bixiou
if
a
man
having
built
a
great
cage
divided
into
thousands
of
compartments
like
the
cells
of
a
beehive
or
the
dens
of
a
menagerie
constructed
to
receive
human
beings
of
all
trades
and
all
kinds
if
that
animal
calling
itself
the
proprietor
should
go
to
a
man
of
science
and
say
i
want
an
individual
of
the
bimanous
species
able
to
live
in
holes
full
of
old
boots
pestiferous
with
rags
and
ten
feet
square
i
want
him
such
that
he
can
live
there
all
his
life
sleep
there
eat
there
be
happy
get
children
as
pretty
as
little
cupids
work
toil
cultivate
flowers
sing
there
stay
there
and
live
in
darkness
but
see
and
know
everything
most
assuredly
the
man
of
science
could
never
have
invented
the
porter
to
oblige
the
proprietor
paris
and
paris
only
could
create
him
or
if
you
choose
the
parisian
creative
powers
have
gone
farther
than
that
said
gazonal
look
at
the
workmen
you
don
t
know
all
the
products
of
industry
though
you
exhibit
them
our
toilers
fight
against
the
toilers
of
the
continent
by
force
of
misery
as
napoleon
fought
europe
by
force
of
here
we
are
at
my
friend
the
usurer
s
said
bixiou
his
name
is
vauvinet
one
of
the
greatest
mistakes
made
by
writers
who
describe
our
manners
and
morals
is
to
harp
on
old
portraits
in
these
days
all
trades
change
the
grocer
becomes
a
peer
of
france
artists
capitalize
their
money
vaudevillists
have
incomes
a
few
rare
beings
may
remain
what
they
originally
were
but
professions
in
general
have
no
longer
either
their
special
costume
or
their
formerly
fixed
habits
and
ways
in
the
past
we
had
gobseck
gigounet
samonon
the
last
of
the
romans
we
rejoice
in
vauvinet
the
usurer
the
dandy
who
frequents
the
greenroom
and
the
lorettes
and
drives
about
in
a
little
coupe
with
one
horse
take
special
note
of
my
man
friend
gazonal
and
you
ll
see
the
comedy
of
money
the
cold
man
who
won
t
give
a
penny
the
hot
man
who
snuffs
a
profit
listen
to
him
attentively
all
three
went
up
to
the
second
floor
of
a
house
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
where
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
the
elegances
then
in
fashion
a
young
man
about
years
of
age
advanced
to
meet
them
with
a
smiling
face
for
he
saw
leon
de
lora
first
vauvinet
held
out
his
hand
with
apparent
friendliness
to
bixiou
and
bowed
coldly
to
gazonal
as
he
motioned
them
to
enter
his
office
where
bourgeois
taste
was
visible
beneath
the
artistic
appearance
of
the
furniture
and
in
spite
of
the
statuettes
and
the
thousand
other
little
trifles
applied
to
our
little
apartments
by
modern
art
which
has
made
itself
as
small
as
its
patrons
vauvinet
was
dressed
like
other
young
men
of
our
day
who
go
into
business
with
extreme
elegance
which
many
of
them
regard
as
a
species
of
prospectus
i
ve
come
for
some
money
said
bixiou
laughing
and
presenting
his
notes
vauvinet
assumed
a
serious
air
which
made
gazonal
smile
such
difference
was
there
between
the
smiling
visage
that
received
them
and
the
countenance
of
the
recalled
to
business
my
dear
fellow
said
vauvinet
looking
at
bixiou
i
should
certainly
oblige
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
i
haven
t
any
money
to
loan
at
the
present
ah
bah
no
i
have
given
all
i
had
to
you
know
who
that
poor
lousteau
went
into
partnership
for
the
management
of
a
theatre
with
an
old
vaudevillist
who
has
great
influence
with
the
ministry
ridal
and
they
came
to
me
yesterday
for
thirty
thousand
francs
i
m
cleaned
out
and
so
completely
that
i
was
just
in
the
act
of
sending
to
cerizet
for
a
hundred
louis
when
i
lost
at
lansquenet
this
morning
at
jenny
cadine
you
must
indeed
me
if
you
can
t
oblige
this
poor
bixiou
said
leon
de
lora
for
he
can
be
very
when
he
hasn
t
a
well
said
bixiou
i
could
never
say
anything
but
good
of
vauvinet
he
s
full
of
my
dear
friend
said
vauvinet
if
i
had
the
money
i
couldn
t
possibly
discount
even
at
fifty
per
cent
notes
which
are
drawn
by
your
porter
ravenouillet
s
paper
isn
t
in
demand
he
s
not
a
rothschild
i
warn
you
that
his
notes
are
worn
thin
you
had
better
invent
another
firm
find
an
uncle
as
for
a
friend
who
ll
sign
notes
for
us
there
s
no
such
being
to
be
found
the
of
the
present
age
is
making
awful
i
have
a
friend
said
bixiou
motioning
to
leon
s
cousin
monsieur
here
one
of
the
most
distinguished
manufacturers
of
cloth
in
the
south
named
gazonal
his
hair
is
not
very
well
dressed
added
bixiou
looking
at
the
touzled
and
luxuriant
crop
on
the
provincial
s
head
but
i
am
going
to
take
him
to
marius
who
will
make
him
look
less
like
a
an
appearance
so
injurious
to
his
credit
and
to
i
don
t
believe
in
southern
securities
be
it
said
without
offence
to
monsieur
replied
vauvinet
with
whom
gazonal
was
so
entertained
that
he
did
not
resent
his
insolence
gazonal
that
extremely
penetrating
intellect
thought
that
the
painter
and
bixiou
intended
by
way
of
teaching
him
to
know
paris
to
make
him
pay
the
thousand
francs
for
his
breakfast
at
the
cafe
de
paris
for
this
son
of
the
pyrenees
had
never
got
out
of
that
armor
of
distrust
which
incloses
the
provincial
in
paris
how
can
you
expect
me
to
have
outstanding
business
at
seven
hundred
miles
from
paris
added
vauvinet
then
you
refuse
me
positively
asked
bixiou
i
have
twenty
francs
and
no
more
said
the
young
usurer
i
m
sorry
for
you
said
the
joker
i
thought
i
was
worth
a
thousand
you
are
worth
two
hundred
thousand
francs
replied
vauvinet
and
sometimes
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
gold
or
at
least
your
tongue
is
but
i
tell
you
i
haven
t
a
very
good
replied
bixiou
then
we
won
t
say
anything
more
about
it
i
had
arranged
for
this
evening
at
carabine
s
the
thing
you
most
wanted
you
know
vauvinet
winked
an
eye
at
bixiou
the
wink
that
two
jockeys
give
each
other
when
they
want
to
say
don
t
try
don
t
you
remember
catching
me
round
the
waist
as
if
i
were
a
pretty
woman
said
bixiou
and
coaxing
me
with
look
and
speech
and
saying
i
ll
do
anything
for
you
if
you
ll
only
get
me
shares
at
par
in
that
railroad
du
tillet
and
nucingen
have
made
an
offer
for
well
old
fellow
du
tillet
and
nucingen
are
coming
to
carabine
s
where
they
will
meet
a
number
of
political
characters
you
ve
lost
a
fine
opportunity
to
you
old
bixiou
rose
leaving
vauvinet
apparently
indifferent
but
inwardly
annoyed
by
the
sense
that
he
had
committed
a
folly
one
moment
my
dear
fellow
said
the
though
i
haven
t
the
money
i
have
credit
if
your
notes
are
worth
nothing
i
can
keep
them
and
give
you
notes
in
exchange
if
we
can
come
to
an
agreement
about
that
railway
stock
we
could
share
the
profits
of
course
in
due
proportion
and
i
ll
allow
you
that
on
no
no
said
bixiou
i
want
money
in
hand
and
i
must
get
those
notes
of
ravenouillet
s
ravenouillet
is
sound
said
vauvinet
he
puts
money
into
the
he
is
good
better
than
you
interposed
leon
for
he
doesn
t
stipend
lorettes
he
hasn
t
any
rent
to
pay
and
he
never
rushes
into
speculations
which
keep
him
dreading
either
a
rise
or
you
think
you
can
laugh
at
me
great
man
returned
vauvinet
once
more
jovial
and
caressing
you
ve
turned
la
fontaine
s
fable
of
le
chene
et
le
roseau
into
an
elixir
come
gubetta
my
old
accomplice
he
continued
seizing
bixiou
round
the
waist
you
want
money
well
i
can
borrow
three
thousand
francs
from
my
friend
cerizet
instead
of
two
let
us
be
friends
cinna
hand
over
your
colossal
cabbages
made
to
trick
the
public
like
a
gardener
s
catalogue
if
i
refused
you
it
was
because
it
is
pretty
hard
on
a
man
who
can
only
do
his
poor
little
business
by
turning
over
his
money
to
have
to
keep
your
ravenouillet
notes
in
the
drawer
of
his
desk
hard
hard
very
hard
what
discount
do
you
want
asked
bixiou
next
to
nothing
returned
vauvinet
it
will
cost
you
a
miserable
fifty
francs
at
the
end
of
the
as
emile
blondet
used
to
say
you
shall
be
my
benefactor
replied
bixiou
twenty
per
cent
whispered
gazonal
to
bixiou
who
replied
by
a
punch
of
his

i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
you
shall

and
many
other
men
who
want
to
make
their
way
their
railway
at
carabine
vauvinet
conducted
the
three
friends
to
the
landing
of
the
staircase
cajoling
bixiou
on
the
way
bixiou
kept
a
grave
face
till
he
reached
the
outer
door
listening
to
gazonal
who
tried
to
enlighten
him
on
his
late
operation
and
to
prove
to
him
that
if
vauvinet
s
follower
cerizet
took
another
twenty
francs
out
of
his
four
hundred
and
fifty
he
was
getting
money
at
forty
per
cent
when
they
reached
the
asphalt
bixiou
frightened
gazonal
by
the
laugh
of
a
parisian
hoaxer
that
cold
mute
laugh
a
sort
of
labial
north
wind
the
assignment
of
the
contract
for
that
railway
is
adjourned
positively
by
the
chamber
i
heard
this
yesterday
from
that
marcheuse
whom
we
smiled
at
just
now
if
i
win
five
or
six
thousand
francs
at
lansquenet
why
should
i
grudge
francs
for
the
power
to
stake
hey
lansquenet
is
another
of
the
thousand
facets
of
paris
as
it
is
said
leon
and
therefore
cousin
i
intend
to
present
you
in
the
salon
of
a
duchess
a
duchess
of
the
rue
where
you
will
see
the
aristocracy
of
the
lorettes
and
probably
be
able
to
win
your
lawsuit
but
it
is
quite
impossible
to
present
you
anywhere
with
that
mop
of
pyrenean
hair
you
look
like
a
porcupine
and
therefore
we
ll
take
you
close
by
place
de
la
bourse
to
marius
another
of
our
comedians
who
is
he
i
ll
tell
you
his
tale
said
bixiou
in
the
year
a
toulousian
named
cabot
a
young
devoured
by
ambition
came
to
paris
and
set
up
a
shop
i
use
your
slang
this
man
of
genius
he
now
has
an
income
of
thousand
francs
a
year
and
lives
retired
from
business
at
libourne
well
he
saw
that
so
vulgar
and
ignoble
a
name
as
cabot
could
never
attain
celebrity
monsieur
de
parny
whose
hair
he
cut
gave
him
the
name
of
marius
infinitely
superior
you
perceive
to
the
christian
names
of
armand
and
hippolyte
behind
which
patronymics
attacked
by
the
cabot
evil
are
wont
to
hide
all
the
successors
of
cabot
have
called
themselves
marius
the
present
marius
is
marius
his
real
name
is
mongin
this
occurs
in
various
other
trades
for
botot
water
and
for
ink
names
become
commercial
property
in
paris
and
have
ended
by
constituting
a
sort
of
ensign
of
nobility
the
present
marius
who
takes
pupils
has
created
he
says
the
leading
school
of
in
the
world
i
ve
seen
in
coming
through
france
said
gazonal
a
great
many
signs
bearing
the
words
such
a
one
pupil
of
his
pupils
have
to
wash
their
hands
after
every
head
said
bixiou
but
marius
does
not
take
them
indifferently
they
must
have
nice
hands
and
not
be
the
most
remarkable
for
manners
appearance
and
elocution
are
sent
out
to
dress
heads
and
they
come
back
tired
to
death
marius
himself
never
turns
out
except
for
titled
women
he
drives
his
cabriolet
and
has
a
but
after
all
he
is
nothing
but
a
barber
cried
gazonal
somewhat
shocked
barber
exclaimed
bixiou
please
remember
that
he
is
captain
in
the
national
guard
and
is
decorated
for
being
the
first
to
spring
into
a
barricade
in
and
take
care
what
you
say
to
him
he
is
neither
barber
nor
he
is
a
director
of
salons
for
said
leon
as
they
went
up
a
staircase
with
crystal
balusters
and
mahogany
rail
the
steps
of
which
were
covered
with
a
sumptuous
carpet
ah
ca
mind
you
don
t
compromise
us
said
bixiou
in
the
antechamber
you
ll
see
lacqueys
who
will
take
off
your
coat
and
seize
your
hat
to
brush
them
and
they
ll
accompany
you
to
the
door
of
the
salons
to
open
and
shut
it
i
mention
this
friend
gazonal
added
bixiou
slyly
lest
you
might
think
they
were
after
your
property
and
cry
stop
thief
these
salons
said
leon
are
three
boudoirs
where
the
director
has
collected
all
the
inventions
of
modern
luxury
lambrequins
to
the
windows
jardinieres
everywhere
downy
divans
where
each
customer
can
wait
his
turn
and
read
the
newspapers
you
might
suppose
when
you
first
go
in
that
five
francs
would
be
the
least
they
d
get
out
of
your
waistcoat
pocket
but
nothing
is
ever
extracted
beyond
ten
sous
for
combing
and
frizzing
your
hair
or
twenty
sous
for
cutting
and
frizzing
elegant
stand
about
among
the
jardinieres
water
is
laid
on
to
the
washstands
enormous
mirrors
reproduce
the
whole
figure
therefore
don
t
look
astonished
when
the
client
that
s
the
elegant
word
substituted
by
marius
for
the
ignoble
word
customer
when
the
client
appears
at
the
door
marius
gives
him
a
glance
which
appraises
him
to
marius
you
are
a
more
or
less
susceptible
of
occupying
his
mind
to
him
there
s
no
mankind
there
are
only
we
let
you
hear
marius
on
all
the
notes
of
his
scale
said
bixiou
and
you
know
how
to
follow
our
as
soon
as
gazonal
showed
himself
the
glance
was
given
and
was
evidently
favourable
for
marius
exclaimed
regulus
yours
this
head
prepare
it
first
with
the
little
excuse
me
said
gazonal
to
the
pupil
at
a
sign
from
bixiou
i
prefer
to
have
my
head
dressed
by
monsieur
marius
marius
much
flattered
by
this
demand
advanced
leaving
the
head
on
which
he
was
engaged
i
am
with
you
in
a
moment
i
am
just
finishing
pray
have
no
uneasiness
my
pupil
will
prepare
you
i
alone
will
decide
the
marius
a
slim
little
man
his
hair
frizzed
like
that
of
rubini
and
jet
black
dressed
also
in
black
with
long
white
cuffs
and
the
frill
of
his
shirt
adorned
with
a
diamond
now
saw
bixiou
to
whom
he
bowed
as
to
a
power
the
equal
of
his
own
that
is
only
an
ordinary
head
he
said
to
leon
pointing
to
the
person
on
whom
he
was
operating
a
grocer
or
something
of
that
kind
but
if
we
devoted
ourselves
to
art
only
we
should
lie
in
bicetre
mad
and
he
turned
back
with
an
inimitable
gesture
to
his
client
after
saying
to
regulus
prepare
monsieur
he
is
evidently
an
a
journalist
said
bixiou
hearing
that
word
marius
gave
two
or
three
strokes
of
the
comb
to
the
ordinary
head
and
flung
himself
upon
gazonal
taking
regulus
by
the
arm
at
the
instant
that
the
pupil
was
about
to
begin
the
operation
of
the
little
scissors
i
will
take
charge
of
monsieur
look
monsieur
he
said
to
the
grocer
reflect
yourself
in
the
great
mirror
if
the
mirror
permits
ossian
a
lacquey
entered
and
took
hold
of
the
client
to
dress
him
you
pay
at
the
desk
monsieur
said
marius
to
the
stupefied
grocer
who
was
pulling
out
his
purse
is
there
any
use
my
dear
fellow
said
bixiou
in
going
through
this
operation
of
the
little
scissors
no
head
ever
comes
to
me
uncleansed
replied
the
illustrious
but
for
your
sake
i
will
do
that
of
monsieur
myself
wholly
my
pupils
sketch
out
the
scheme
or
my
strength
would
not
hold
out
every
one
says
as
you
do
dressed
by
marius
therefore
i
can
give
only
the
finishing
strokes
what
journal
is
monsieur
on
if
i
were
you
i
should
keep
three
or
four
mariuses
said
gazonal
ah
monsieur
i
see
is
a
feuilletonist
said
marius
alas
in
dressing
heads
which
expose
us
to
notice
it
is
impossible
excuse
me
he
left
gazonal
to
overlook
regulus
who
was
preparing
a
newly
arrived
head
tapping
his
tongue
against
his
palate
he
made
a
disapproving
noise
which
may
perhaps
be
written
down
as
titt
titt
there
there
good
heavens
that
cut
is
not
square
your
scissors
are
hacking
it
here
see
there
regulus
you
are
not
clipping
poodles
these
are
men
who
have
a
character
if
you
continue
to
look
at
the
ceiling
instead
of
looking
only
between
the
glass
and
the
head
you
will
dishonor
my
you
are
stern
monsieur
i
owe
them
the
secrets
of
my
then
it
is
an
art
said
gazonal
marius
affronted
looked
at
gazonal
in
the
glass
and
stopped
short
the
scissors
in
one
hand
the
comb
in
the
other
monsieur
you
speak
like
a
child
and
yet
from
your
accent
i
judge
you
are
from
the
south
the
birthplace
of
men
of
yes
i
know
that
requires
some
taste
replied
gazonal
hush
monsieur
hush
i
expected
better
things
of
you
let
me
tell
you
that
a
i
don
t
say
a
good
for
a
man
is
or
he
is
not
a
a
i
repeat
is
more
difficult
to
find
than
what
shall
i
say
than
i
don
t
know
what
a
minister
sit
still
no
for
you
can
t
judge
by
ministers
the
streets
are
full
of
them
a
paganini
no
he
s
not
great
enough
a
monsieur
a
man
who
divines
your
soul
and
your
habits
in
order
to
dress
your
hair
conformably
with
your
being
that
man
has
all
that
constitutes
a
philosopher
and
such
he
is
see
the
women
women
appreciate
us
they
know
our
value
our
value
to
them
is
the
conquest
they
make
when
they
have
placed
their
heads
in
our
hands
to
attain
a
triumph
i
say
to
you
that
a
the
world
does
not
know
what
he
is
i
who
speak
to
you
i
am
very
nearly
all
that
there
is
of
without
boasting
i
may
say
i
am
known
still
i
think
more
might
be
done
the
execution
that
is
everything
ah
if
women
would
only
give
me
carte
blanche
if
i
might
only
execute
the
ideas
that
come
to
me
i
have
you
see
a
hell
of
imagination
but
the
women
don
t
fall
in
with
it
they
have
their
own
plans
they
ll
stick
their
fingers
or
combs
as
soon
as
my
back
is
turned
through
the
most
delicious
edifices
which
ought
to
be
engraved
and
perpetuated
for
our
works
monsieur
last
unfortunately
but
a
few
hours
a
great
hey
he
s
like
careme
and
vestris
in
their
careers
head
a
little
this
way
if
you
please
so
i
attend
particularly
to
front
faces
our
profession
is
ruined
by
bunglers
who
understand
neither
the
epoch
nor
their
art
there
are
dealers
in
wigs
and
essences
who
are
enough
to
make
one
s
hair
stand
on
end
they
care
only
to
sell
you
bottles
it
is
pitiable
but
that
s
business
such
poor
wretches
cut
hair
and
dress
it
as
they
can
i
when
i
arrived
in
paris
from
toulouse
my
ambition
was
to
succeed
the
great
marius
to
be
a
true
marius
to
make
that
name
illustrious
i
alone
more
than
all
the
four
others
i
said
to
myself
i
will
conquer
or
there
now
sit
straight
i
am
going
to
finish
you
i
was
the
first
to
introduce
i
made
my
salons
the
object
of
curiosity
i
disdain
advertisements
what
advertisements
would
have
cost
monsieur
i
put
into
elegance
charm
comfort
next
year
i
shall
have
a
quartette
in
one
of
the
salons
to
discourse
music
and
of
the
best
yes
we
ought
to
charm
away
the
ennui
of
those
whose
heads
we
dress
i
do
not
conceal
from
myself
the
annoyances
to
a
client
look
at
yourself
to
have
one
s
hair
dressed
is
fatiguing
perhaps
as
much
so
as
posing
for
one
s
portrait
monsieur
knows
perhaps
that
the
famous
monsieur
humbolt
i
did
the
best
i
could
with
the
few
hairs
america
left
him
science
has
this
in
common
with
savages
that
she
scalps
her
men
clean
that
illustrious
savant
said
that
next
to
the
suffering
of
going
to
be
hanged
was
that
of
going
to
be
painted
but
i
place
the
trial
of
having
your
head
dressed
before
that
of
being
painted
and
so
do
certain
women
well
monsieur
my
object
is
to
make
those
who
come
here
to
have
their
hair
cut
or
frizzed
enjoy
themselves
hold
still
you
have
a
tuft
which
be
conquered
a
jew
proposed
to
supply
me
with
italian
cantatrices
who
during
the
interludes
were
to
depilate
the
young
men
of
forty
but
they
proved
to
be
girls
from
the
conservatoire
and
from
the
rue
montmartre
there
you
are
monsieur
your
head
is
dressed
as
that
of
a
man
of
talent
ought
to
be
ossian
he
said
to
the
lacquey
in
livery
dress
monsieur
and
show
him
out
whose
turn
next
he
added
proudly
gazing
round
upon
the
persons
who
awaited
him
don
t
laugh
gazonal
said
leon
as
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
whence
his
eye
could
take
in
the
whole
of
the
place
de
la
bourse
i
see
over
there
one
of
our
great
men
and
you
shall
compare
his
language
with
that
of
the
barber
and
tell
me
which
of
the
two
you
think
the
most
don
t
laugh
gazonal
said
bixiou
mimicking
leon
s
intonation
what
do
you
suppose
is
marius
s
business
he
has
obtained
a
monopoly
of
the
sale
of
hair
in
bulk
as
a
certain
dealer
in
comestibles
who
is
going
to
sell
us
a
pate
for
three
francs
has
acquired
a
monopoly
of
the
sale
of
truffles
he
discounts
the
paper
of
that
business
he
loans
money
on
pawn
to
clients
when
embarrassed
he
gives
annuities
on
lives
he
gambles
at
the
bourse
he
is
a
stockholder
in
all
the
fashion
papers
and
he
sells
under
the
name
of
a
certain
chemist
an
infamous
drug
which
for
his
share
alone
gives
him
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
and
costs
in
advertisements
a
hundred
thousand
is
it
possible
cried
gazonal
remember
this
said
bixiou
gravely
in
paris
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
small
business
all
things
swell
to
large
proportions
down
to
the
sale
of
rags
and
matches
the
who
with
his
napkin
under
his
arm
meets
you
as
you
enter
his
shop
may
be
worth
his
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
the
waiter
in
a
restaurant
is
eligible
for
the
chamber
the
man
you
take
for
a
beggar
in
the
street
carries
a
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
unset
diamonds
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
didn
t
steal
them
the
three
inseparables
for
one
day
at
any
rate
now
crossed
the
place
de
la
bourse
in
a
way
to
intercept
a
man
about
forty
years
of
age
wearing
the
legion
of
honor
who
was
coming
from
the
boulevard
by
way
of
the
rue
hey
said
leon
what
are
you
pondering
over
my
dear
dubourdieu
some
fine
symbolic
composition
my
dear
cousin
i
have
the
pleasure
to
present
to
you
our
illustrious
painter
dubourdieu
not
less
celebrated
for
his
humanitarian
convictions
than
for
his
talents
in
art
dubourdieu
my
cousin
dubourdieu
a
small
pale
man
with
melancholy
blue
eyes
bowed
slightly
to
gazonal
who
bent
low
as
before
a
man
of
genius
so
you
have
elected
stidmann
in
place
of
he
began
how
could
i
help
it
i
wasn
t
there
replied
lora
you
bring
the
academy
into
disrepute
continued
the
painter
to
choose
such
a
man
as
that
i
don
t
wish
to
say
ill
of
him
but
he
works
at
a
trade
where
are
you
dragging
the
first
of
arts
the
art
those
works
are
the
most
lasting
bringing
nations
to
light
of
which
the
world
has
long
lost
even
the
memory
an
art
which
crowns
and
consecrates
great
men
yes
sculpture
is
priesthood
it
preserves
the
ideas
of
an
epoch
and
you
give
its
chair
to
a
maker
of
toys
and
mantelpieces
an
ornamentationist
a
seller
of
ah
as
chamfort
said
one
has
to
swallow
a
viper
every
morning
to
endure
the
life
of
paris
well
at
any
rate
art
remains
to
a
few
of
us
they
can
t
prevent
us
from
cultivating
it
and
besides
my
dear
fellow
you
have
a
consolation
which
few
artists
possess
the
future
is
yours
said
bixiou
when
the
world
is
converted
to
our
doctrine
you
will
be
at
the
head
of
your
art
for
you
are
putting
into
it
ideas
which
people
will
understand
they
are
generalized
in
fifty
years
from
now
you
ll
be
to
all
the
world
what
you
are
to
a
few
of
us
at
this
moment
a
great
man
the
only
question
is
how
to
get
along
till
i
have
just
finished
resumed
the
great
artist
his
face
expanding
like
that
of
a
man
whose
hobby
is
stroked
an
allegorical
figure
of
harmony
and
if
you
will
come
and
see
it
you
will
understand
why
it
should
have
taken
me
two
years
to
paint
it
everything
is
in
it
at
the
first
glance
one
divines
the
destiny
of
the
globe
a
queen
holds
a
shepherd
s
crook
in
her
hand
symbolical
of
the
advancement
of
the
races
useful
to
mankind
she
wears
on
her
head
the
cap
of
liberty
her
breasts
are
sixfold
as
the
egyptians
carved
them
for
the
egyptians
foresaw
fourier
her
feet
are
resting
on
two
clasped
hands
which
embrace
a
globe
symbol
of
the
brotherhood
of
all
human
races
she
tramples
cannon
under
foot
to
signify
the
abolition
of
war
and
i
have
tried
to
make
her
face
express
the
serenity
of
triumphant
agriculture
i
have
also
placed
beside
her
an
enormous
curled
cabbage
which
according
to
our
master
is
an
image
of
harmony
ah
it
is
not
the
least
among
fourier
s
titles
to
veneration
that
he
has
restored
the
gift
of
thought
to
plants
he
has
bound
all
creation
in
one
by
the
signification
of
things
to
one
another
and
by
their
special
language
a
hundred
years
hence
this
earth
will
be
much
larger
than
it
is
and
how
will
that
monsieur
come
to
pass
said
gazonal
stupefied
at
hearing
a
man
outside
of
a
lunatic
asylum
talk
in
this
way
through
the
extending
of
production
if
men
will
apply
the
system
it
will
not
be
impossible
to
act
upon
the
what
would
become
of
painting
in
that
case
asked
gazonal
it
would
be
would
our
eyes
be
magnified
too
said
gazonal
looking
at
his
two
friends
significantly
man
will
return
to
what
he
was
before
he
became
degenerate
our
men
will
then
be
is
your
picture
finished
asked
leon
entirely
finished
replied
dubourdieu
i
have
tried
to
see
hiclar
and
get
him
to
compose
a
symphony
for
it
i
wish
that
while
viewing
my
picture
the
public
should
hear
music
a
la
beethoven
to
develop
its
ideas
and
bring
them
within
range
of
the
intellect
by
two
arts
ah
if
the
government
would
only
lend
me
one
of
the
galleries
of
the
louvre
i
ll
mention
it
if
you
want
me
to
do
so
you
should
never
neglect
an
opportunity
to
strike
ah
my
friends
are
preparing
articles
but
i
am
afraid
they
ll
go
too
pooh
said
bixiou
they
can
t
go
as
far
as
the
dubourdieu
looked
askance
at
bixiou
and
continued
his
way
why
he
s
mad
said
gazonal
he
is
following
the
moon
in
her
his
skill
is
masterly
said
leon
and
he
knows
his
art
but
fourierism
has
killed
him
you
have
just
seen
cousin
one
of
the
effects
of
ambition
upon
artists
too
often
in
paris
from
a
desire
to
reach
more
rapidly
than
by
natural
ways
the
celebrity
which
to
them
is
fortune
artists
borrow
the
wings
of
circumstance
they
think
they
make
themselves
of
more
importance
as
men
of
a
specialty
the
supporters
of
some
system
and
they
fancy
they
can
transform
a
clique
into
the
public
one
is
a
republican
another
this
one
aristocrat
that
one
catholic
others
middle
ages
or
german
as
they
choose
for
their
purpose
now
though
opinions
do
not
give
talent
they
always
spoil
what
talent
there
is
and
the
poor
fellow
whom
you
have
just
seen
is
a
proof
thereof
an
artist
s
opinion
ought
to
be
faith
in
his
art
in
his
work
and
his
only
way
of
success
is
toil
when
nature
has
given
him
the
sacred
let
us
get
away
said
bixiou
leon
is
beginning
to
but
that
man
was
sincere
said
gazonal
still
stupefied
perfectly
sincere
replied
bixiou
as
sincere
as
the
king
of
barbers
just
he
is
mad
repeated
gazonal
and
he
is
not
the
first
man
driven
man
by
fourier
s
ideas
said
bixiou
you
don
t
know
anything
about
paris
ask
it
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
realize
an
idea
that
will
be
useful
to
humanity
the
for
instance
and
you
ll
die
like
salomon
de
caux
at
bicetre
but
if
the
money
is
wanted
for
some
paradoxical
absurdity
parisians
will
annihilate
themselves
and
their
fortune
for
it
it
is
the
same
with
systems
as
it
is
with
material
things
utterly
impracticable
newspapers
have
consumed
millions
within
the
last
fifteen
years
what
makes
your
lawsuit
so
hard
to
win
is
that
you
have
right
on
your
side
and
on
that
of
the
prefect
there
are
so
you
suppose
secret
do
you
think
that
a
man
of
intellect
having
once
understood
the
nature
of
paris
could
live
elsewhere
said
leon
to
his
cousin
suppose
we
take
gazonal
to
old
mere
fontaine
said
bixiou
making
a
sign
to
the
driver
of
a
citadine
to
draw
up
it
will
be
a
step
from
the
real
to
the
fantastic
driver
vieille
rue
du
and
all
three
were
presently
rolling
in
the
direction
of
the
marais
what
are
you
taking
me
to
see
now
asked
gazonal
the
proof
of
what
bixiou
told
you
replied
leon
we
shall
show
you
a
woman
who
makes
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
by
working
a
fantastic
a
said
bixiou
interpreting
the
look
of
the
southerner
as
a
question
madame
fontaine
is
thought
by
those
who
seek
to
pry
into
the
future
to
be
wiser
in
her
wisdom
than
mademoiselle
she
must
be
very
rich
remarked
gazonal
she
was
the
victim
of
her
own
idea
as
long
as
lotteries
existed
said
bixiou
for
in
paris
there
are
no
great
gains
without
corresponding
outlays
the
strongest
heads
are
liable
to
crack
there
as
if
to
give
vent
to
their
steam
those
who
make
much
money
have
vices
or
fancies
no
doubt
to
establish
an
and
now
that
the
lottery
is
abolished
asked
gazonal
oh
now
she
has
a
nephew
for
whom
she
is
when
they
reached
the
vieille
rue
du
temple
the
three
friends
entered
one
of
the
oldest
houses
in
that
street
and
passed
up
a
shaking
staircase
the
steps
of
which
caked
with
mud
led
them
in
and
through
a
stench
peculiar
to
houses
on
an
alley
to
the
third
story
where
they
beheld
a
door
which
painting
alone
could
render
literature
would
have
to
spend
too
many
nights
in
suitably
describing
it
an
old
woman
in
keeping
with
that
door
and
who
might
have
been
that
door
in
human
guise
ushered
the
three
friends
into
a
room
which
served
as
an
where
in
spite
of
the
warm
atmosphere
which
fills
the
streets
of
paris
they
felt
the
icy
chill
of
crypts
about
them
a
damp
air
came
from
an
inner
courtyard
which
resembled
a
huge
the
light
that
entered
was
gray
and
the
sill
of
the
window
was
filled
with
pots
of
sickly
plants
in
this
room
which
had
a
coating
of
some
greasy
fuliginous
substance
the
furniture
the
chairs
the
table
were
all
most
abject
the
floor
tiles
oozed
like
a
in
short
every
accessory
was
in
keeping
with
the
fearful
old
woman
of
the
hooked
nose
ghastly
face
and
decent
rags
who
directed
the
consulters
to
sit
down
informing
them
that
only
one
at
a
time
could
be
admitted
to
madame
gazonal
who
played
the
intrepid
entered
bravely
and
found
himself
in
presence
of
one
of
those
women
forgotten
by
death
who
no
doubt
forgets
them
intentionally
in
order
to
leave
some
samples
of
itself
among
the
living
he
saw
before
him
a
withered
face
in
which
shone
fixed
gray
eyes
of
wearying
immobility
a
flattened
nose
smeared
with
snuff
well
set
up
by
muscles
that
under
pretence
of
being
hands
played
nonchalantly
with
a
pack
of
cards
like
some
machine
the
movement
of
which
is
about
to
run
down
the
body
a
species
of
decently
covered
with
clothes
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
death
and
did
not
stir
above
the
forehead
rose
a
coif
of
black
velvet
madame
fontaine
for
it
was
really
a
woman
had
a
black
hen
on
her
right
hand
and
a
huge
toad
named
astaroth
on
her
left
gazonal
did
not
at
first
perceive
them
the
toad
of
surprising
dimensions
was
less
alarming
in
himself
than
through
the
effect
of
two
topaz
eyes
large
as
a
piece
which
cast
forth
vivid
gleams
it
was
impossible
to
endure
that
look
the
toad
is
a
creature
as
yet
unexplained
perhaps
the
whole
animal
creation
including
man
is
comprised
in
it
for
as
lassailly
said
the
toad
exists
indefinitely
and
as
we
know
it
is
of
all
created
animals
the
one
whose
marriage
lasts
the
longest
the
black
hen
had
a
cage
about
two
feet
distant
from
the
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
to
which
she
came
along
a
plank
which
formed
a
sort
of
drawbridge
between
the
cage
and
the
table
when
the
woman
the
least
real
of
the
creatures
in
this
hoffmanesque
den
said
to
gazonal
cut
the
worthy
provincial
shuddered
involuntarily
that
which
renders
these
beings
so
formidable
is
the
importance
of
what
we
want
to
know
people
go
to
them
as
they
know
very
well
to
buy
hope
the
den
of
the
sibyl
was
much
darker
than
the
antechamber
the
color
of
the
walls
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
the
ceiling
blackened
by
smoke
far
from
reflecting
the
little
light
that
came
from
a
window
obstructed
by
pale
and
sickly
vegetations
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
it
but
the
table
where
the
sorceress
sat
received
what
there
was
of
this
fully
the
table
the
chair
of
the
woman
and
that
on
which
gazonal
was
seated
formed
the
entire
furniture
of
the
little
room
which
was
divided
at
one
end
by
a
sort
of
loft
where
madame
fontaine
probably
slept
gazonal
heard
through
a
door
the
bubbling
murmur
of
a
that
kitchen
sound
accompanied
by
a
composite
odor
in
which
the
effluvia
of
a
sink
predominated
mingled
incongruous
ideas
of
the
necessities
of
actual
life
with
those
of
supernatural
power
disgust
entered
into
curiosity
gazonal
observed
one
stair
of
pine
wood
the
lowest
no
doubt
of
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
loft
he
took
in
these
minor
details
at
a
glance
with
a
sense
of
nausea
it
was
all
quite
otherwise
alarming
than
the
romantic
tales
and
scenes
of
german
drama
lead
one
to
expect
here
was
suffocating
actuality
the
air
diffused
a
sort
of
dizzy
heaviness
the
dim
light
rasped
the
nerves
when
the
southerner
impelled
by
a
species
of
gazed
firmly
at
the
toad
he
felt
a
sort
of
emetic
heat
at
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
was
conscious
of
a
terror
like
that
a
criminal
might
feel
in
presence
of
a
gendarme
he
endeavoured
to
brace
himself
by
looking
at
madame
fontaine
but
there
he
encountered
two
almost
white
eyes
the
motionless
and
icy
pupils
of
which
were
absolutely
intolerable
to
him
the
silence
became
terrifying
which
do
you
wish
monsieur
the
fortune
the
fortune
or
the
grand
game
the
fortune
is
dear
enough
replied
the
southerner
making
powerful
efforts
not
to
yield
to
the
influence
of
the
surroundings
in
which
he
found
himself
at
the
moment
when
gazonal
was
thus
endeavouring
to
collect
himself
a
voice
an
infernal
voice
made
him
bound
in
his
chair
the
black
hen
clucked
go
back
my
daughter

back
monsieur
chooses
to
spend
only

the
hen
seemed
to
understand
her
mistress
for
after
coming
within
a
foot
of
the
cards
she
turned
and
resumed
her
former
place
what
flower
to
you
like
best
asked
the
old
woman
in
a
voice
hoarsened
by
the
phlegm
which
seemed
to
rise
and
fall
incessantly
in
her
bronchial
tubes
the
what
color
are
you
fond
of
what
animal
do
you
prefer
the
horse
why
these
questions
he
asked
man
derives
his
form
from
his
anterior
states
she
said
sententiously
hence
his
instincts
and
his
instincts
rule
his
destiny

madame

looked
attentively
at
the
lines
of
the
hand
that
was
shown
to
her
it
was
all
done
seriously
with
no
pretence
of
sorcery
on
the
contrary
with
the
simplicity
a
notary
might
have
shown
when
asking
the
intentions
of
a
client
about
a
deed
presently
she
shuffled
the
cards
and
asked
gazonal
to
cut
them
and
then
to
make
three
packs
of
them
himself
after
which
she
took
the
packs
spread
them
out
before
her
and
examined
them
as
a
gambler
examines
the
numbers
at
roulette
before
he
risks
his
stake
gazonal
s
bones
were
freezing
he
seemed
not
to
know
where
he
was
but
his
amazement
grew
greater
and
greater
when
this
hideous
old
woman
in
a
green
bonnet
stout
and
squat
whose
false
front
was
frizzed
into
points
of
interrogation
proceeded
in
a
thick
voice
to
relate
to
him
all
the
particular
circumstances
even
the
most
secret
of
his
past
life
she
told
him
his
tastes
his
habits
his
character
the
thoughts
of
his
childhood
everything
that
had
influenced
his
life
a
marriage
broken
off
why
with
whom
the
exact
description
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
finally
the
place
he
came
from
his
lawsuit
etc
gazonal
at
first
thought
it
was
a
hoax
prepared
by
his
companions
but
the
absolute
impossibility
of
such
a
conspiracy
appeared
to
him
almost
as
soon
as
the
idea
itself
and
he
sat
speechless
before
that
truly
infernal
power
the
incarnation
of
which
borrowed
from
humanity
a
form
which
the
imagination
of
painters
and
poets
has
throughout
all
ages
regarded
as
the
most
awful
of
created
things
namely
a
toothless
hideous
wheezing
hag
with
cold
lips
flattened
nose
and
whitish
eyes
the
pupils
of
those
eyes
had
brightened
through
them
rushed
a
ray
was
it
from
the
depths
of
the
future
or
from
hell

the
old
creature
of
what

toad
and
the
hen
were
to
her

over
the

to
get
the

for

two
wonderful
intelligences

never

horrified
by
the
gaze

into
the
antechamber
after
bowing
to
the
terrible

woman

was
moist
from

to

the
incubation

evil
spirit

us
get
away

the
statesmen
and
of
all
artists
consult
madame
fontaine
and
i
know
a
minister
to
whom
she
is
an
did
she
tell
you
about
your
future
asked
leon
no
i
had
enough
of
her
about
my
past
but
added
gazonal
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
if
she
can
by
the
help
of
those
dreadful
collaborators
predict
the
future
how
came
she
to
lose
in
the
lottery
ah
you
put
your
finger
on
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
occult
science
replied
leon
the
moment
that
the
species
of
inward
mirror
on
which
the
past
or
the
future
is
reflected
to
their
minds
become
clouded
by
the
breath
of
a
personal
feeling
by
an
idea
foreign
to
the
purpose
of
the
power
they
are
exerting
sorcerers
and
sorceresses
can
see
nothing
just
as
an
artist
who
blurs
art
with
political
combinations
and
systems
loses
his
genius
not
long
ago
a
man
endowed
with
the
gift
of
divining
by
cards
a
rival
to
madame
fontaine
became
addicted
to
vicious
practices
and
being
unable
to
tell
his
own
fate
from
the
cards
was
arrested
tried
and
condemned
at
the
court
of
assizes
madame
fontaine
who
predicts
the
future
eight
times
out
of
ten
was
never
able
to
know
if
she
would
win
or
lose
in
a
it
is
the
same
thing
in
magnetism
remarked
bixiou
a
man
can
t
magnetize
heavens
now
we
come
to
magnetism
cried
gazonal
ah
ca
do
you
know
everything
friend
gazonal
replied
bixiou
gravely
to
be
able
to
laugh
at
everything
one
must
know
everything
as
for
me
i
ve
been
in
paris
since
my
childhood
i
ve
lived
by
means
of
my
pencil
on
its
follies
and
absurdities
at
the
rate
of
five
caricatures
a
month
consequently
i
often
laugh
at
ideas
in
which
i
have
come
let
us
get
to
something
else
said
leon
we
ll
go
to
the
chamber
and
settle
the
cousin
s
this
said
bixiou
imitating
odry
in
les
funambules
is
high
comedy
for
we
will
make
the
first
orator
we
meet
pose
for
us
and
you
shall
see
that
in
those
halls
of
legislation
as
elsewhere
the
parisian
language
has
but
two
tones
as
they
got
into
their
citadine
leon
saw
in
a
rapidly
driven
cabriolet
a
man
to
whom
he
made
a
sign
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
him
there
s
publicola
masson
said
leon
to
bixiou
i
m
going
to
ask
for
a
sitting
this
evening
at
five
o
clock
after
the
chamber
the
cousin
shall
then
see
the
most
curious
of
all
the
who
is
he
asked
gazonal
while
leon
went
to
speak
to
publicola
masson
an
replied
bixiou
author
of
a
treatise
on
corporistics
who
cuts
your
corns
by
subscription
and
who
if
the
republications
triumph
for
six
months
will
assuredly
become
drives
his
carriage
ejaculated
gazonal
but
my
good
gazonal
it
is
only
millionaires
who
have
time
to
go
afoot
in
to
the
chamber
cried
leon
to
the
coachman
getting
back
into
the
carriage
which
monsieur
deputies
replied
leon
exchanging
a
smile
with
bixiou
paris
begins
to
confound
me
said
gazonal
to
make
you
see
its
immensity
moral
political
and
literary
we
are
now
proceeding
like
the
roman
cicerone
who
shows
you
in
saint
peter
s
the
thumb
of
the
statue
you
took
to
be
and
the
thumb
proves
to
be
a
foot
long
you
haven
t
yet
measured
so
much
as
a
great
toe
of
and
remark
cousin
gazonal
that
we
take
things
as
they
come
we
haven
t
this
evening
you
shall
sup
as
they
feasted
at
belshazzar
s
and
there
you
shall
see
our
paris
our
own
particular
paris
playing
lansquenet
and
risking
a
hundred
thousand
francs
at
a
throw
without
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
citadine
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
going
up
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
at
that
end
of
the
pont
de
la
concorde
which
leads
to
discord
i
thought
the
chamber
unapproachable
said
the
provincial
surprised
to
find
himself
in
the
great
lobby
that
depends
replied
bixiou
materially
speaking
it
costs
thirty
sous
for
a
citadine
to
approach
it
politically
you
have
to
spend
rather
more
the
swallows
thought
so
a
poet
says
that
the
arc
de
triomphe
was
erected
for
them
we
artists
think
that
this
public
building
was
built
for
us
to
compensate
for
the
stupidities
of
the
and
make
us
laugh
but
the
comedians
on
this
stage
are
much
more
expensive
and
they
don
t
give
us
every
day
the
value
of
our
so
this
is
the
chamber
cried
gazonal
as
he
paced
the
great
hall
in
which
there
were
then
about
a
dozen
persons
and
looked
around
him
with
an
air
which
bixiou
noted
down
in
his
memory
and
reproduced
in
one
of
the
famous
caricatures
with
which
he
rivalled
gavarni
leon
went
to
speak
to
one
of
the
ushers
who
go
and
come
continually
between
this
hall
and
the
hall
of
sessions
with
which
it
communicates
by
a
passage
in
which
are
stationed
the
stenographers
of
the
moniteur
and
persons
attached
to
the
chamber
as
for
the
minister
replied
the
usher
to
leon
as
gazonal
approached
them
he
is
there
but
i
don
t
know
if
monsieur
giraud
has
come
i
ll
as
the
usher
opened
one
side
of
the
double
door
through
which
none
but
deputies
ministers
or
messengers
from
the
king
are
allowed
to
pass
gazonal
saw
a
man
come
out
who
seemed
still
young
although
he
was
really
years
old
and
to
whom
the
usher
evidently
indicated
leon
de
lora
ha
you
here
he
exclaimed
shaking
hands
with
both
bixiou
and
lora
scamps
what
are
you
doing
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
laws
parbleu
we
ve
come
to
learn
how
to
blague
said
bixiou
we
might
get
rusty
if
we
didn
let
us
go
into
the
garden
said
the
young
man
not
observing
that
gazonal
belonged
to
the
party
seeing
that
this
was
in
black
the
provincial
did
not
know
in
which
political
category
to
place
him
but
he
followed
the
others
into
the
garden
contiguous
to
the
hall
which
follows
the
line
of
the
quai
napoleon
once
in
the
garden
the
young
man
gave
way
to
a
peal
of
laughter
which
he
seemed
to
have
been
repressing
since
he
entered
the
lobby
what
is
it
asked
leon
de
lora
my
dear
friend
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
the
constitutional
government
we
are
forced
to
tell
the
most
frightful
lies
with
incredible
but
as
for
me
i
m
freakish
some
days
i
can
lie
like
a
prospectus
other
days
i
can
t
be
serious
this
is
one
of
my
hilarious
days
now
at
this
moment
the
prime
minister
being
summoned
by
the
opposition
to
make
known
a
certain
diplomatic
secret
is
going
through
his
paces
in
the
tribune
being
an
honest
man
who
never
lies
on
his
own
account
he
whispered
to
me
as
he
mounted
the
breach
heaven
knows
what
i
shall
say
to
a
mad
desire
to
laugh
overcame
me
and
as
one
mustn
t
laugh
on
the
ministerial
bench
i
rushed
out
for
my
youth
does
come
back
to
me
most
unseasonably
at
at
last
cried
gazonal
i
ve
found
an
honest
man
in
paris
you
must
be
a
very
superior
man
he
added
looking
at
the
stranger
ah
ca
who
is
this
gentleman
said
the
young
man
examining
gazonal
my
cousin
said
leon
hastily
i
ll
answer
for
his
silence
and
his
honor
as
for
my
own
it
is
on
his
account
we
have
come
here
now
he
has
a
case
before
the
administration
which
depends
on
your
ministry
his
prefect
evidently
wants
to
ruin
him
and
we
have
come
to
see
you
in
order
to
prevent
the
council
of
state
from
ratifying
a
great
who
brings
up
the
case
and
our
friends
giraud
and
claude
vignon
are
on
the
committee
said
bixiou
say
just
a
word
to
them
urged
leon
tell
them
to
come
to
carabine
s
where
du
tillet
gives
a
fete
apropos
of
railways
they
are
plundering
more
than
ever
on
the
ah
ca
but
isn
t
your
cousin
from
the
pyrenees
asked
the
young
man
now
become
serious
yes
replied
gazonal
and
you
did
not
vote
for
us
in
the
last
elections
said
the
statesman
looking
hard
at
gazonal
no
but
what
you
have
just
said
in
my
hearing
has
bribed
me
on
the
word
of
a
commandant
of
the
national
guard
i
ll
have
your
candidate
elected
very
good
will
you
guarantee
your
cousin
asked
the
young
man
turning
to
leon
we
are
forming
him
said
bixiou
in
a
tone
irresistibly
comic
well
i
ll
see
about
it
said
the
young
man
leaving
his
friends
and
rushing
precipitately
back
to
the
chamber
who
is
that
asked
gazonal
the
comte
de
rastignac
the
minister
of
the
department
in
which
your
affair
is
brought
a
minister
isn
t
a
minister
anything
more
than
that
he
is
an
old
friend
of
ours
he
now
has
three
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
he
s
a
peer
of
france
the
king
has
made
him
a
count
he
married
nucingen
s
daughter
and
he
is
one
of
the
two
or
three
statesmen
produced
by
the
revolution
of
july
but
his
fame
and
his
power
bore
him
sometimes
and
he
comes
down
to
laugh
with
ah
ca
cousin
why
didn
t
you
tell
us
you
belonged
to
the
opposition
asked
leon
seizing
gazonal
by
the
arm
how
stupid
of
you
one
deputy
more
or
less
to
right
or
left
and
your
bed
is
we
are
all
for
the
others
down
my
let
em
go
said
bixiou
with
a
facetious
look
they
have
providence
on
their
side
and
providence
will
bring
them
back
without
you
and
in
spite
of
themselves
a
manufacturer
ought
to
be
a
what
luck
there
s
maxime
with
canalis
and
giraud
said
leon
come
along
friend
gazonal
the
promised
actors
are
mustering
on
the
stage
said
bixiou
and
all
three
advanced
to
the
personages
who
seemed
to
be
sauntering
along
with
nothing
to
do
have
they
turned
you
out
or
why
are
you
idling
about
in
this
way
said
bixiou
to
giraud
no
while
they
are
voting
by
secret
ballot
we
have
come
out
for
a
little
air
replied
giraud
how
did
the
prime
minister
pull
through
he
was
magnificent
said
canalis
magnificent
repeated
maxime
magnificent
cried
giraud
so
so
right
left
and
centre
are
unanimous
all
with
a
different
meaning
observed
maxime
de
trailles
maxime
was
the
ministerial
deputy
yes
said
canalis
laughing
though
canalis
had
already
been
a
minister
he
was
at
this
moment
tending
toward
the
right
ah
but
you
had
a
fine
triumph
just
now
said
maxime
to
canalis
it
was
you
who
forced
the
minister
into
the
and
made
him
lie
like
a
charlatan
returned
canalis
a
worthy
victory
said
the
honest
giraud
in
his
place
what
would
you
have
done
i
should
have
it
isn
t
called
lying
said
maxime
de
trailles
it
is
called
protecting
the
so
saying
he
led
canalis
away
to
a
little
distance
that
s
a
great
orator
said
leon
to
giraud
pointing
to
canalis
yes
and
no
replied
the
councillor
of
state
a
fine
bass
voice
and
sonorous
but
more
of
an
artist
in
words
than
an
orator
in
short
he
s
a
fine
instrument
but
he
isn
t
music
consequently
he
has
not
and
he
never
will
have
the
ear
of
the
chamber
in
no
case
will
he
ever
be
master
of
the
canalis
and
maxime
were
returning
toward
the
little
group
as
giraud
deputy
of
the
left
centre
pronounced
this
verdict
maxime
took
giraud
by
the
arm
and
led
him
off
probably
to
make
the
same
confidence
he
had
just
made
canalis
what
an
honest
upright
fellow
that
is
said
leon
to
canalis
nodding
towards
giraud
one
of
those
upright
fellows
who
kill
administrators
replied
canalis
do
you
think
him
a
good
orator
yes
and
no
replied
canalis
he
is
wordy
he
s
a
plodder
in
argument
and
a
good
logician
but
he
doesn
t
understand
the
higher
logic
that
of
events
and
circumstances
consequently
he
has
never
had
and
never
will
have
the
ear
of
the
at
the
moment
when
canalis
uttered
this
judgment
on
giraud
the
latter
was
returning
with
maxime
to
the
group
and
forgetting
the
presence
of
a
stranger
whose
discretion
was
not
known
to
them
like
that
of
leon
and
bixiou
he
took
canalis
by
the
hand
in
a
very
significant
manner
well
he
said
i
consent
to
what
monsieur
de
trailles
proposes
i
ll
put
the
question
to
you
in
the
chamber
but
i
shall
do
it
with
great
then
we
shall
have
the
house
with
us
for
a
man
of
your
weight
and
your
eloquence
is
certain
to
have
the
ear
of
the
chamber
said
canalis
i
ll
reply
to
you
but
i
shall
do
it
sharply
to
crush
you
could
bring
about
a
change
of
the
cabinet
for
on
such
ground
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
the
chamber
and
be
master
of
the
maxime
has
trapped
them
both
said
leon
to
his
cousin
that
fellow
is
like
a
fish
in
water
among
the
intrigues
of
the
who
is
he
asked
gazonal
an
who
is
now
in
a
fair
way
to
become
an
ambassador
replied
bixiou
giraud
said
leon
to
the
councillor
of
state
don
t
leave
the
chamber
without
asking
rastignac
what
he
promised
to
tell
you
about
a
suit
you
are
to
render
a
decision
on
two
days
hence
it
concerns
my
cousin
here
i
ll
go
and
see
you
morning
early
about
the
three
friends
followed
the
three
deputies
at
a
distance
into
the
lobby
cousin
look
at
those
two
men
said
leon
pointing
out
to
him
a
former
minister
and
the
leader
of
the
left
centre
those
are
two
men
who
really
have
the
ear
of
the
chamber
and
who
are
called
in
jest
ministers
of
the
department
of
the
opposition
they
have
the
ear
of
the
chamber
so
completely
that
they
are
always
pulling
it
is
four
o
clock
said
bixiou
let
us
go
back
to
the
rue
de
yes
you
ve
now
seen
the
heart
of
the
government
cousin
and
you
must
next
be
shown
the
ascarides
the
taenia
the
intestinal
worm
the
republican
since
i
must
needs
name
him
said
leon
when
the
three
friends
were
once
more
packed
into
their
gazonal
looked
at
his
cousin
and
bixiou
like
a
man
who
had
a
mind
to
launch
a
flood
of
oratorical
and
southern
bile
upon
the
elements
i
distrusted
with
all
my
might
this
great
hussy
of
a
town
he
rolled
out
in
southern
accents
but
since
this
morning
i
despise
her
the
poor
little
province
you
think
so
petty
is
an
honest
girl
but
paris
is
a
prostitute
a
greedy
lying
comedian
and
i
am
very
thankful
not
to
be
robbed
of
my
skin
in
the
day
is
not
over
yet
said
bixiou
sententiously
winking
at
leon
and
why
do
you
complain
in
that
stupid
way
said
leon
of
a
prostitution
to
which
you
will
owe
the
winning
of
your
lawsuit
do
you
think
you
are
more
virtuous
than
we
less
of
a
comedian
less
greedy
less
liable
to
fall
under
some
temptation
less
conceited
than
those
we
have
been
making
dance
for
you
like
puppets
try
me
poor
lad
said
leon
shrugging
his
shoulders
haven
t
you
already
promised
rastignac
your
electoral
influence
yes
because
he
was
the
only
one
who
ridiculed
poor
lad
repeated
bixiou
why
slight
me
who
am
always
ridiculing
myself
you
are
like
a
barking
at
a
tiger
ha
if
you
saw
us
really
ridiculing
a
man
you
d
see
that
we
can
drive
a
sane
man
this
conversation
brought
gazonal
back
to
his
cousin
s
house
where
the
sight
of
luxury
silenced
him
and
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
too
late
he
perceived
that
bixiou
had
been
making
him
pose
at
five
o
clock
the
moment
when
leon
de
lora
was
making
his
evening
toilet
to
the
great
wonderment
of
gazonal
who
counted
the
thousand
and
one
superfluities
of
his
cousin
and
admired
the
solemnity
of
the
valet
as
he
performed
his
functions
the
pedicure
of
monsieur
was
announced
and
publicola
masson
a
little
man
fifty
years
of
age
made
his
appearance
laid
a
small
box
of
instruments
on
the
floor
and
sat
down
on
a
small
chair
opposite
to
leon
after
bowing
to
gazonal
and
bixiou
how
are
matters
going
with
you
asked
leon
delivering
to
publicola
one
of
his
feet
already
washed
and
prepared
by
the
valet
i
am
forced
to
take
two
pupils
two
young
fellows
who
despairing
of
fortune
have
quitted
surgery
for
corporistics
they
were
actually
dying
of
hunger
and
yet
they
are
full
of
i
m
not
asking
you
about
pedestrial
affairs
i
want
to
know
how
you
are
getting
on
masson
gave
a
glance
at
gazonal
more
eloquent
than
any
species
of
question
oh
you
can
speak
out
that
s
my
cousin
in
a
way
he
belongs
to
you
he
thinks
himself
well
we
are
coming
along
we
are
advancing
in
five
years
from
now
europe
will
be
with
us
switzerland
and
italy
are
fermenting
finely
and
when
the
occasion
comes
we
are
all
ready
here
in
paris
we
have
fifty
thousand
armed
men
without
counting
two
hundred
thousand
citizens
who
haven
t
a
penny
to
live
pooh
said
leon
how
about
the
fortifications
we
can
swallow
them
replied
masson
in
the
first
place
we
sha
n
t
let
the
cannon
in
and
in
the
second
we
ve
got
a
little
machine
more
powerful
than
all
the
forts
in
the
world
a
machine
due
to
a
doctor
which
cured
more
people
during
the
short
time
we
worked
it
than
the
doctors
ever
how
you
talk
exclaimed
gazonal
whose
flesh
began
to
creep
at
publicola
s
air
and
manner
ha
that
s
the
thing
we
rely
on
we
follow
and
robespierre
but
we
ll
do
better
than
they
they
were
timid
and
you
see
what
came
of
it
an
emperor
the
elder
branch
the
younger
branch
the
montagnards
didn
t
lop
the
social
tree
ah
ca
you
who
will
be
they
tell
me
consul
or
something
of
that
kind
tribune
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
remember
said
bixiou
that
i
have
asked
your
protection
for
the
last
dozen
no
harm
shall
happen
to
you
we
shall
need
wags
and
you
can
take
the
place
of
barere
replied
the
and
i
said
leon
ah
you
you
are
my
client
and
that
will
save
you
for
genius
is
an
odious
privilege
to
which
too
much
is
accorded
in
france
we
shall
be
forced
to
annihilate
some
of
our
greatest
men
in
order
to
teach
others
to
be
simple
the
spoke
with
a
air
that
made
gazonal
shudder
so
he
said
there
s
to
be
no
more
religion
no
more
religion
the
replied
the
pedicure
emphasizing
the
last
words
every
man
will
have
his
own
it
is
very
fortunate
that
the
government
is
just
now
endowing
convents
they
ll
provide
our
funds
everything
you
see
conspires
in
our
favour
those
who
pity
the
peoples
who
clamor
on
behalf
of
proletaries
who
write
works
against
the
jesuits
who
busy
themselves
about
the
amelioration
of
no
matter
what
the
communists
the
humanitarians
the
philanthropists
you
understand
all
these
people
are
our
advanced
guard
while
we
are
storing
gunpowder
they
are
making
the
tinder
which
the
spark
of
a
single
circumstance
will
but
what
do
you
expect
will
make
the
happiness
of
france
cried
gazonal
equality
of
citizens
and
cheapness
of
provisions
we
mean
that
there
will
be
no
persons
lacking
anything
no
millionaires
no
suckers
of
blood
and
that
s
it
maximum
and
minimum
said
gazonal
you
ve
said
it
replied
the
decisively
no
more
manufacturers
asked
gazonal
the
state
will
manufacture
we
shall
all
be
the
usufructuaries
of
france
each
will
have
his
ration
as
on
board
ship
and
all
the
world
will
work
according
to
their
ah
said
gazonal
and
while
awaiting
the
time
when
you
can
cut
off
the
heads
of
aristocrats
i
cut
their
nails
said
the
radical
republican
putting
up
his
tools
and
finishing
the
jest
himself
then
he
bowed
very
politely
and
went
away
can
this
be
possible
in
cried
gazonal
if
there
were
time
we
could
show
you
said
his
cousin
all
the
personages
of
and
you
could
talk
with
them
you
have
just
seen
marat
well
we
know
collot
d
herbois
robespierre
chabot
fouche
barras
there
is
even
a
magnificent
madame
well
the
tragic
is
not
lacking
in
your
play
said
gazonal
it
is
six
o
clock
before
we
take
you
to
see
odry
in
les
saltimbauques
said
leon
to
gazonal
we
must
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
madame
cadine
an
actress
whom
your
massol
cultivates
and
to
whom
you
must
therefore
pay
the
most
assiduous
and
as
it
is
all
important
that
you
conciliate
that
power
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
few
instructions
said
bixiou
do
you
employ
workwomen
in
your
manufactory
of
course
i
do
replied
gazonal
that
s
all
i
want
to
know
resumed
bixiou
you
are
not
married
and
you
are
a
great
yes
cried
gazonal
you
ve
guessed
my
strong
point
i
m
a
great
lover
of
well
then
if
you
will
execute
the
little
manoeuvre
which
i
am
about
to
prescribe
for
you
you
will
taste
without
spending
a
farthing
the
sweets
to
be
found
in
the
good
graces
of
an
when
they
reached
the
rue
de
la
victoire
where
the
celebrated
actress
lived
bixiou
who
meditated
a
trick
upon
the
distrustful
provincial
had
scarcely
finished
teaching
him
his
role
but
gazonal
was
quick
as
we
shall
see
to
take
a
hint
the
three
friends
went
up
to
the
second
floor
of
a
rather
handsome
house
and
found
madame
jenny
cadine
just
finishing
dinner
for
she
played
that
night
in
an
afterpiece
at
the
gymnase
having
presented
gazonal
to
this
great
power
leon
and
bixiou
in
order
to
leave
them
alone
together
made
the
excuse
of
looking
at
a
piece
of
furniture
in
another
room
but
before
leaving
bixiou
had
whispered
in
the
actress
s
ear
he
is
leon
s
cousin
a
manufacturer
enormously
rich
he
wants
to
win
a
suit
before
the
council
of
state
against
his
prefect
and
he
thinks
it
wise
to
fascinate
you
in
order
to
get
massol
on
his
all
paris
knows
the
beauty
of
that
young
actress
and
will
therefore
understand
the
stupefaction
of
the
southerner
on
seeing
her
though
she
had
received
him
at
first
rather
coldly
he
became
the
object
of
her
good
graces
before
they
had
been
many
minutes
alone
together
how
strange
said
gazonal
looking
round
him
disdainfully
on
the
furniture
of
the
salon
the
door
of
which
his
accomplices
had
left
half
open
that
a
woman
like
you
should
be
allowed
to
live
in
such
an
ah
yes
indeed
but
how
can
i
help
it
massol
is
not
rich
i
am
hoping
he
will
be
made
a
what
a
happy
man
cried
gazonal
heaving
the
sigh
of
a
provincial
good
thought
she
i
shall
have
new
furniture
and
get
the
better
of
well
my
dear
said
leon
returning
you
ll
be
sure
to
come
to
carabine
s
won
t
you
supper
and
will
monsieur
be
there
said
jenny
cadine
looking
artlessly
and
graciously
at
gazonal
yes
madame
replied
the
countryman
dazzled
by
such
rapid
success
but
massol
will
be
there
said
bixiou
well
what
of
that
returned
jenny
come
we
must
part
my
treasures
i
must
go
to
the
gazonal
gave
his
hand
to
the
actress
and
led
her
to
the
citadine
which
was
waiting
for
her
as
he
did
so
he
pressed
hers
with
such
ardor
that
jenny
cadine
exclaimed
shaking
her
fingers
take
care
i
haven
t
any
when
the
three
friends
got
back
into
their
own
vehicle
gazonal
endeavoured
to
seize
bixiou
round
the
waist
crying
out
she
bites
you
re
a
fine
rascal
so
women
say
replied
bixiou
at
eleven
o
clock
after
the
play
another
citadine
took
the
trio
to
the
house
of
mademoiselle
seraphine
sinet
better
known
under
the
name
of
carabine
one
of
those
pseudonyms
which
famous
lorettes
take
or
which
are
given
to
them
a
name
which
in
this
instance
may
have
referred
to
the
pigeons
she
had
killed
carabine
now
become
almost
a
necessity
for
the
banker
du
tillet
deputy
of
the
left
lived
in
a
charming
house
in
the
rue
in
paris
there
are
many
houses
the
destination
of
which
never
varies
and
the
one
we
now
speak
of
had
already
seen
seven
careers
of
courtesans
a
broker
had
brought
there
about
the
year
suzanne
du
afterwards
madame
gaillard
in
that
house
the
famous
esther
caused
the
baron
de
nucingen
to
commit
the
only
follies
of
his
life
florine
and
subsequently
a
person
now
called
in
jest
the
late
madame
schontz
had
scintillated
there
in
turn
bored
by
his
wife
du
tillet
bought
this
modern
little
house
and
there
installed
the
celebrated
carabine
whose
lively
wit
and
cavalier
manners
and
shameless
brilliancy
were
a
counterpoise
to
the
dulness
of
domestic
life
and
the
toils
of
finance
and
politics
whether
du
tillet
or
carabine
were
at
home
or
not
at
home
supper
was
served
and
splendidly
served
for
ten
persons
every
day
artists
men
of
letters
journalists
and
the
habitues
of
the
house
supped
there
when
they
pleased
after
supper
they
gambled
more
than
one
member
of
both
chambers
came
there
to
buy
what
paris
pays
for
by
its
weight
in
gold
namely
the
amusement
of
intercourse
with
anomalous
untrammelled
women
those
meteors
of
the
parisian
firmament
who
are
so
difficult
to
class
there
wit
reigns
for
all
can
be
said
and
all
is
said
carabine
a
rival
of
the
no
less
celebrated
malaga
had
finally
inherited
the
salon
of
florine
now
madame
raoul
nathan
and
of
madame
schontz
now
wife
of
du
ronceret
as
he
entered
gazonal
made
one
remark
only
but
that
remark
was
both
legitimate
and
legitimist
it
is
finer
than
the
tuileries
the
satins
velvets
brocades
the
gold
the
objects
of
art
that
swarmed
there
so
filled
the
eyes
of
the
wary
provincial
that
at
first
he
did
not
see
madame
jenny
cadine
in
a
toilet
intended
to
inspire
respect
who
concealed
behind
carabine
watched
his
entrance
observingly
while
conversing
with
others
my
dear
child
said
leon
to
carabine
this
is
my
cousin
a
manufacturer
who
descended
upon
me
from
the
pyrenees
this
morning
he
knows
nothing
of
paris
and
he
wants
massol
to
help
him
in
a
suit
he
has
before
the
council
of
state
we
have
therefore
taken
the
liberty
to
bring
him
his
name
is
gazonal
to
supper
entreating
you
to
leave
him
his
full
that
s
as
monsieur
pleases
wine
is
dear
said
carabine
looking
gazonal
over
from
head
to
foot
and
thinking
him
in
no
way
remarkable
gazonal
bewildered
by
the
toilets
the
lights
the
gilding
the
chatter
of
the
various
groups
whom
he
thought
to
be
discussing
him
could
only
manage
to
stammer
out
the
words
madame
madame
is
very
what
do
you
manufacture
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
laughing
say
laces
and
offer
her
some
guipure
whispered
bixiou
in
gazonal
s
ear
said
gazonal
perceiving
that
he
would
have
to
pay
for
his
supper
it
will
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
offer
you
a
dress
a
scarf
a
mantilla
of
my
ah
three
things
well
you
are
nicer
than
you
look
to
be
returned
carabine
paris
has
caught
me
thought
gazonal
now
perceiving
jenny
cadine
and
going
up
to
her
and
i
said
the
actress
what
am
i
to
have
all
i
possess
replied
gazonal
thinking
that
to
offer
all
was
to
give
nothing
massol
claude
vignon
du
tillet
maxime
de
trailles
nucingen
du
bruel
malaga
monsieur
and
madame
gaillard
vauvinet
and
a
crowd
of
other
personages
now
entered
after
a
conversation
with
the
manufacturer
on
the
subject
of
his
suit
massol
without
making
any
promises
told
him
that
the
report
was
not
yet
written
and
that
citizens
could
always
rely
on
the
knowledge
and
the
independence
of
the
council
of
state
receiving
that
cold
and
dignified
response
gazonal
in
despair
thought
it
necessary
to
set
about
seducing
the
charming
jenny
with
whom
he
was
by
this
time
in
love
leon
de
lora
and
bixiou
left
their
victim
in
the
hands
of
that
most
roguish
and
frolicsome
member
of
the
anomalous
society
for
jenny
cadine
is
the
sole
rival
in
that
respect
of
the
famous
dejazet
at
the
where
gazonal
was
fascinated
by
a
silver
service
made
by
the
modern
benvenuto
cellini
the
contents
of
which
were
worthy
of
the
container
his
mischievous
friends
were
careful
to
sit
at
some
distance
from
him
but
they
followed
with
cautious
eye
the
manoeuvres
of
the
clever
actress
who
being
attracted
by
the
insidious
hope
of
getting
her
furniture
renewed
was
playing
her
cards
to
take
the
provincial
home
with
her
no
sheep
upon
the
day
of
the
ever
more
meekly
allowed
his
little
saint
john
to
lead
him
along
than
gazonal
as
he
followed
his
siren
three
days
later
leon
and
bixiou
who
had
not
seen
gazonal
since
that
evening
went
to
his
lodgings
about
two
in
the
afternoon
well
cousin
said
leon
the
council
of
state
has
decided
in
favour
of
your
maybe
but
it
is
useless
now
cousin
said
gazonal
lifting
a
melancholy
eye
to
his
two
friends
i
ve
become
a
what
does
that
mean
asked
leon
i
haven
t
anything
left
not
even
enough
to
pay
my
lawyer
replied
gazonal
madame
jenny
cadine
has
got
notes
of
hand
out
of
me
to
the
amount
of
more
money
than
all
the
property
i
own
the
fact
is
cadine
is
rather
dear
but
oh
but
i
didn
t
get
anything
for
my
money
said
gazonal
what
a
woman
well
i
ll
own
the
provinces

not
a
match
for

i
shall
retire

said
bixiou
now

are
reasonable
come

the
majesty
of
the

added
leon
holding
out
to
gazonal
his
notes
of
hand
gazonal
gazed
at
the
papers
with
a
stupefied
air
you
can
t
say
now
that

understand
