important
note
on
this
text
this
biography
though
historically
based
should
not
be
considered
factual
it
is
not
that
there
was
no
such
man
indeed
there
was
and
other
accounts
indicate
that
francis
marion
is
as
deserving
of
praise
as
this
account
would
indicate
or
moreso
it
is
not
that
the
events
described
did
not
take
place
most
of
them
at
least
did
it
is
simply
that
parson
weems
mason
locke
weems
in
an
honest
effort
to
teach
a
high
patriotism
nobility
and
morality
sometimes
embellished
or
exaggerated
his
stories
to
the
point
of
falsehood
as
with
his
invention
of
the
cherry
tree
anecdote
in
his
life
of
washington
it
seems
strange
that
such
a
devotion
to
moral
teaching
should
use
falsehoods
to
reach
its
audience
but
he
apparently
felt
the
means
justified
by
the
end
not
everyone
agreed
with
his
methods
and
peter
horry
wrote
to
him
i
requested
you
would
if
necessary
so
far
alter
the
work
as
to
make
it
read
grammatically
and
i
gave
you
leave
to
embellish
the
work
but
entertained
not
the
least
idea
of
what
has
happened
you
have
carved
and
mutilated
it
with
so
many
erroneous
statements
your
embellishments
observation
and
remarks
must
necessarily
be
erroneous
as
proceeding
from
false
grounds
can
you
suppose
i
can
be
pleased
with
reading
particulars
though
so
elevated
by
you
of
marion
and
myself
when
i
know
such
never
existed
though
horry
did
not
want
to
be
known
as
the
of
this
work
i
have
suffered
to
let
his
name
remain
with
this
notice
as
it
has
traditionally
been
connected
with
it
for
all
this
the
basic
ideas
gleaned
largely
from
facts
provided
by
peter
horry
and
robert
marion
the
nephew
of
francis
remain
largely
unchanged
even
in
this
decadent
state
weems
biography
brought
the
nation
attention
to
francis
marion
and
inspired
numerous
other
writers
to
touch
on
the
subject
two
of
these
works
biographies
by
james
and
simms
are
especially
noteworthy
therefore
for
the
literary
rather
than
strictly
historical
value

preface
o
that
mine
enemy
would
write
a
book
this
in
former
times
passed
for
as
sore
an
evil
as
a
good
man
could
think
of
wishing
to
his
worst
enemy
whether
any
of
my
enemies
ever
wished
me
so
great
an
evil
i
know
not
but
certain
it
is
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
as
writing
a
book
and
least
of
all
a
book
what
i
a
man
here
under
the
frozen
zone
and
grand
climacteric
of
my
days
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
and
the
other
hard
by
to
quit
my
prayer
book
and
crutches
an
old
man
best
companion
and
drawing
my
sword
flourish
and
fight
over
again
the
battles
of
my
youth
the
lord
forbid
me
such
madness
but
what
can
one
do
when
one
friends
are
eternally
teasing
him
as
they
are
me
and
calling
out
at
every
whipstitch
and
corner
of
the
streets
well
but
sir
where
marion
where
the
history
of
marion
that
we
have
so
long
been
looking
for
was
in
vain
that
i
told
them
i
was
no
scholar
no
historian
god
said
i
gentlemen
has
made
men
of
many
minds
one
for
this
thing
and
another
for
that
but
i
am
morally
certain
he
never
made
me
for
a
writer
i
did
indeed
once
understand
something
about
the
use
of
a
broadsword
but
as
to
a
pen
gentlemen
that
quite
another
part
of
speech
the
difference
between
a
broadsword
and
a
pen
gentlemen
is
prodigious
and
it
is
not
every
officer
let
me
tell
you
gentlemen
who
can
like
caesar
fight
you
a
great
battle
with
his
sword
and
fight
it
over
again
with
his
pen
burn
caesar
replied
they
and
his
book
too
if
it
were
written
in
letters
of
gold
we
would
not
read
it
what
have
honest
republicans
like
us
to
do
with
such
an
ambitious
and
robber
besides
sir
your
reasoning
about
scholarship
and
fine
style
and
all
that
does
not
begging
your
pardon
apply
at
all
to
the
case
in
hand
small
subjects
indeed
require
great
writers
to
set
them
off
but
great
subjects
require
no
such
artificial
helps
like
true
beauties
they
shine
most
in
the
simplest
dress
marion
is
one
of
this
sort
great
in
his
simplicity
then
give
us
marion
plain
brave
honest
marion
that
all
we
want
sir
and
you
can
do
this
better
than
any
other
man
you
have
known
him
longest
have
fought
closest
by
his
side
and
can
best
tell
us
of
his
noble
deeds
and
surely
now
after
all
you
ca
bear
to
let
him
die
and
all
his
great
actions
and
be
forgotten
forever
this
i
confess
went
to
the
quick
and
roused
me
completely
what
marion
forgotten
i
exclaimed
marion
forgotten
and
by
me
no
never
never
while
memory
looks
back
on
the
dreadful
days
of
the
revolution
when
a
british
despot
not
the
nation
for
i
esteem
them
most
generous
but
a
proud
stupid
obstinate
despot
trampling
the
holy
charter
and
constitution
of
england
realm
issued
against
us
sons
of
britons
that
most
unrighteous
edict
taxation
without
representation
and
then
because
in
the
spirit
of
our
gallant
fathers
we
bravely
opposed
him
he
broke
up
the
very
fountains
of
his
malice
and
let
loose
upon
us
every
indescribable
unimaginable
curse
of
civil
war
when
british
armies
with
their
hessian
and
indian
and
tory
allies
overran
my
afflicted
country
swallowing
up
its
fruits
and
filling
every
part
with
consternation
when
no
thing
was
to
be
seen
but
flying
crowds
burning
houses
and
young
men
alas
too
often
hanging
upon
the
trees
like
dogs
and
old
men
wringing
their
withered
hands
over
their
murdered
boys
and
women
and
children
weeping
and
flying
from
their
ruined
plantations
into
the
starving
woods
when
i
think
i
say
of
these
things
oh
my
god
how
can
i
ever
forget
marion
that
vigilant
undaunted
soldier
whom
thy
own
mercy
raised
up
to
scourge
such
monsters
and
avenge
his
country
wrongs
the
washington
of
the
south
he
steadily
pursued
the
warfare
most
safe
for
us
and
most
fatal
to
our
enemies
he
taught
us
to
sleep
in
the
swamps
to
feed
on
roots
to
drink
the
turbid
waters
of
the
ditch
to
prowl
nightly
round
the
encampments
of
the
foe
like
lions
round
the
habitations
of
the
shepherds
who
had
slaughtered
their
cubs
sometimes
he
taught
us
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
by
surprise
distracting
the
midnight
hour
with
the
horrors
of
our
battle
at
other
times
when
our
forces
were
increased
he
led
us
on
boldly
to
the
charge
hewing
the
enemy
to
pieces
under
the
approving
light
of
day
oh
marion
my
friend
my
friend
never
can
i
forget
thee
although
thy
wars
are
all
ended
and
thyself
at
rest
in
the
grave
yet
i
see
thee
still
i
see
thee
as
thou
wert
wont
to
ride
most
terrible
in
battle
to
the
enemies
of
thy
country
thine
eyes
like
balls
of
fire
flamed
beneath
thy
lowering
brows
but
lovely
still
wert
thou
in
mercy
thou
bravest
among
the
sons
of
men
for
soon
as
the
enemy
sinking
under
our
swords
cried
for
quarter
thy
heart
swelled
with
commiseration
and
thy
countenance
was
changed
even
as
the
countenance
of
a
man
who
beheld
the
slaughter
of
his
brothers
the
basest
tory
who
could
but
touch
the
hem
of
thy
garment
was
safe
the
avengers
of
blood
stopped
short
in
thy
presence
and
turned
away
abashed
from
the
lightning
of
thine
eyes
o
that
my
pen
were
of
the
quill
of
the
swan
that
sings
for
future
days
then
shouldst
thou
my
friend
receive
the
fulness
of
thy
fame
the
fathers
of
the
years
to
come
should
talk
of
thy
noble
deeds
and
the
youth
yet
unborn
should
rise
up
and
call
thee
blessed
fired
at
the
charm
of
thy
virtues
they
should
follow
thee
in
the
path
of
thy
glory
and
make
themselves

future

their

francis
immortal
may
their
memory
be
who
fought
and
bled
for
liberty
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
was
a
glorious
year
for
america
it
gave
birth
to
two
of
the
noblest
thunderbolts
of
her
wars
george
washington
and
francis
marion
the
latter
was
born
in
john
parish
south
carolina
his
father
also
was
a
carolinian
but
his
grandfather
was
a
huguenot
or
french
protestant
who
lived
near
rochelle
in
the
blind
and
bigoted
days
of
louis
xiv
the
priests
who
are
the
persecutors
in
all
countries
except
america
could
not
bear
that
he
should
worship
god
in
his
own
way
or
dream
of
going
to
heaven
but
in
their
leading
strings
and
therefore
soon
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
must
either
recant
or
trot
that
is
quit
his
heresy
or
his
country
too
brave
to
play
the
hypocrite
and
too
wise
to
hope
for
happiness
with
a
wounded
spirit
he
quickly
made
up
his
mind
and
like
faithful
abraham
forsook
his
country
to
wander
an
exile
in
lands
unknown
the
angel
who
guides
the
footsteps
of
the
virtuous
directed
his
course
to
south
carolina
and
as
a
reward
for
his
piety
placed
him
in
a
land
where
mighty
deeds
and
honors
were
ripening
for
his
grandson
nor
did
he
wander
alone
a
cherub
in
the
form
of
a
lovely
wife
followed
his
fortunes
and
gave
him
to
know
from
happy
experience
that
where
love
is
there
is
no
exile
previous
to
his
expulsion
the
priests
had
for
some
time
suspected
young
marion
of
what
they
called
heresy
but
learning
that
he
was
enamoured
of
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
mademoiselle
louisa
and
like
to
win
her
affections
they
withheld
for
a
while
their
sacred
thunders
hoping
that
through
fear
of
them
and
love
of
her
he
might
yet
return
to
the
bosom
of
the
catholic
church
to
which
she
belonged
young
marion
suit
to
his
fair
mistress
was
fortunate
to
the
full
extent
of
an
ardent
lover
wishes
the
charming
girl
repaid
his
passion
with
such
liberal
interest
that
in
a
short
time
after
the
commencement
of
their
delicious
friendship
she
received
him
for
her
husband
in
spite
of
all
that
wealthier
wooers
could
promise
or
frowning
friends
could
threaten
the
neighboring
clergy
now
marked
the
conduct
of
marion
with
a
keener
eye
and
discovering
in
him
no
symptoms
that
pointed
to
recantation
they
furiously
pressed
the
bishop
to
enforce
against
him
the
edict
of
banishment
at
this
time
marion
with
his
lovely
louisa
were
living
on
a
small
farm
in
the
vicinity
of
rochelle
as
he
walked
one
afternoon
in
the
main
street
of
that
city
he
was
very
rudely
accosted
by
a
couple
of
officers
of
the
holy
inquisition
whose
looks
and
dress
were
as
dark
and
diabolical
as
their
employment
vous
etes
nommes
marion
said
they
that
is
your
name
is
marion
yes
gentlemen
that
is
my
name
upon
this
they
rudely
thrust
a
letter
into
his
hand
and
turned
away
but
with
such
looks
as
tigers
throw
at
a
tender
lambkin
whose
fold
forbids
their
access
on
opening
the
letter
he
found
as
follows
your
damnable
heresy
well
deserves
even
in
this
life
that
purgation
by
fire
which
awfully
awaits
it
in
the
next
but
in
consideration
of
your
youth
and
worthy
connexions
our
mercy
has
condescended
to
commute
your
punishment
to
perpetual
exile
you
will
therefore
instantly
prepare
to
quit
your
country
for
ever
for
if
after
ten
days
from
the
date
hereof
you
should
be
found
in
any
part
of
the
kingdom
your
miserable
body
shall
be
consumed
by
fire
and
your
impious
ashes
scattered
on
the
winds
of
heaven
pere
rochelle
i
forewarn
all
my
friends
from
thinking
me
capable
of
charging
this
vile
persecuting
spirit
on
the
old
w
of
rome
exclusively
no
thank
god
i
have
not
so
learned
human
nature
and
they
who
are
yet
to
learn
may
by
reading
the
catholic
layman
soon
get
satisfied
that
the
priests
are
as
apt
to
abuse
power
as
the
people
and
that
when
clad
with
a
little
brief
authority
protestants
as
well
as
papists
have
committed
those
cruelties
which
make
milder
devils
blush
by
way
of
a
note
on
a
note
i
would
observe
that
the
catholic
layman
is
a
very
sensible
and
spirited
pamphlet
the
production
it
is
said
of
mathew
carey
of
philadelphia
who
though
a
roman
catholic
has
printed
more
protestant
bibles
and
testaments
than
half
the
preachers
and
printers
in
america
put
together
mathew
carey
was
also
weems
publisher
had
this
dreadful
letter
been
presented
to
marion
even
while
a
bachelor
it
would
have
filled
him
with
horror
for
the
heart
naturally
cleaves
to
the
spot
where
it
awoke
into
being
and
quits
with
tearful
eyes
the
scenes
among
which
were
spent
the
first
and
happiest
days
of
life
but
ties
stronger
than
those
of
nature
bound
marion
to
his
country
his
country
was
the
country
of
his
louisa
how
could
he
live
without
her
and
how
could
he
hope
that
she
would
ever
consent
to
leave
her
parents
and
friends
to
wander
and
die
with
him
in
hopeless
exile
but
though
greatly
dejected
yet
he
did
not
despair
he
still
trusted
in
that
who
smiles
even
under
frowns
and
often
pours
his
richest
showers
from
the
blackest
clouds
cheered
with
this
hope
he
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
and
set
out
to
seek
his
louisa
with
arms
fondly
interlocked
she
had
accompanied
him
that
morning
to
the
gate
on
the
back
of
the
garden
through
which
he
generally
passed
when
he
went
to
rochelle
soon
as
his
horse
was
led
up
and
he
about
to
mount
she
snatched
the
bridle
and
laughing
vowed
he
should
not
go
until
he
had
promised
her
one
thing
well
charmer
what
that
why
that
you
will
return
very
soon
well
indeed
i
will
so
now
let
me
go
oh
no
i
am
afraid
that
when
you
get
out
of
sight
you
will
play
truant
you
must
give
me
security
well
louisa
what
security
shall
i
give
you
why
you
must
give
me
that
thing
whatever
it
be
that
you
hold
most
dear
in
all
the
world
well
done
and
now
louisa
i
give
you
yourself
the
dearest
thing
god
ever
gave
me
in
all
this
world
at
this
her
fine
face
was
reddened
all
over
with
blushing
joy
while
her
eyes
beaming
on
his
awakened
that
transport
which
those
who
have
felt
it
would
not
exchange
for
worlds
then
after
the
fond
lengthened
kiss
and
tender
sigh
of
happy
lovers
parting
he
rode
off
soon
as
he
was
out
of
her
sight
she
turned
to
go
to
the
house
as
she
passed
along
the
garden
the
sudden
fancy
struck
her
to
adorn
the
summer
house
with
evergreens
and
flowers
of
the
liveliest
tints
and
there
amidst
a
wilderness
of
sweets
to
receive
her
returning
lover
animated
with
this
fond
suggestion
of
conjugal
affection
woman
true
life
which
at
every
quickened
pulse
diffused
an
answering
rapture
through
the
virtuous
breast
she
commenced
her
pleasing
task
and
with
her
task
she
mingled
the
music
of
her
voice
clear
and
strong
as
the
morning
lark
and
sweet
as
from
a
heart
full
of
innocence
and
love
the
pleasant
sounds
reached
the
ear
of
marion
as
he
drew
near
the
garden
then
entering
the
gate
without
noise
he
walked
up
unperceived
close
to
her
as
she
sat
all
alone
in
the
arbour
binding
her
fragrant
flowers
and
singing
the
happy
hours
away
she
was
singing
her
favorite
hymn
by
madam
guyon
that
love
i
sing
that
wondrous
love
which
wak
my
sleeping
clay
that
spread
the
sky
in
azure
bright
and
pour
the
golden
day
to
see
youth
and
beauty
though
in
a
stranger
thus
pointing
to
heaven
is
delightful
to
a
pious
heart
then
what
rapture
to
an
enlightened
soul
to
see
a
beloved
wife
thus
communing
with
god
and
becoming
every
day
more
and
more
angelic
soon
as
her
song
was
finished
he
called
out
louisa
startled
at
the
sudden
call
she
turned
around
to
the
voice
presenting
a
face
on
which
love
and
sweet
surprise
had
spread
those
rosy
charms
which
in
a
moment
banished
all
his
sorrows
my
dearest
gabriel
she
exclaimed
dropping
her
flowers
and
running
and
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
here
take
back
your
security
take
back
your
security
and
also
my
thanks
for
being
such
a
man
of
honor
but
what
brought
you
back
love
so
much
earlier
than
you
expected
here
the
memory
of
that
fatal
letter
went
like
a
dagger
to
his
heart
bleaching
his
manly
cheeks
he
would
have
evaded
the
question
but
in
vain
for
louisa
startled
at
the
sudden
paleness
of
his
looks
insisted
the
more
earnestly
to
know
the
cause
he
delayed
a
moment
but
conscious
that
the
secret
must
soon
come
out
he
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
with
a
reluctant
hand
put
it
into
hers
scarcely
had
she
run
through
it
which
she
did
with
the
most
devouring
haste
when
she
let
it
drop
from
her
hands
and
faintly
articulating
ah
cruel
priest
she
fell
upon
his
bosom
which
she
bathed
with
her
tears
after
some
moments
of
distress
too
big
for
utterance
marion
deeply
sighing
at
length
broke
silence
ah
louisa
and
must
we
part
so
soon
at
this
starting
up
with
eyes
suffused
with
tears
but
beaming
immortal
love
she
hastily
replied
part
yes
continued
he
part
for
ever
part
no
marion
no
never
never
ah
can
you
louisa
leave
father
and
mother
and
follow
a
poor
banished
husband
like
me
yes
yes
father
mother
and
all
the
world
will
i
leave
to
follow
thee
marion
o
blessed
priest
i
thank
you
good
bishop
rochelle
holy
father
in
god
i
thank
you
your
persecution
has
enriched
me
above
princes
it
has
discovered
to
me
a
mine
of
love
in
louisa
soul
that
i
never
dreamed
of
before
my
dearest
gabriel
did
you
ever
doubt
my
love
pardon
me
my
love
i
never
doubted
your
love
oh
no
i
knew
you
loved
me
the
circumstances
under
which
you
married
me
gave
me
delicious
proof
of
that
to
have
preferred
me
to
so
many
wealthier
wooers
to
have
taken
me
as
a
husband
to
the
paradise
of
your
arms
when
so
many
others
would
have
sent
me
as
a
heretic
to
the
purgatory
of
the
inquisition
was
evidence
of
love
never
to
be
forgotten
but
that
in
addition
to
all
this
you
should
now
be
so
ready
to
leave
father
and
mother
country
and
kin
to
follow
me
a
poor
wanderer
in
the
earth
without
even
a
place
where
to
lay
my
head
yes
yes
replied
she
eagerly
interrupting
him
that
the
very
reason
i
would
leave
all
to
follow
you
for
oh
my
love
how
could
i
enjoy
father
or
mother
country
or
kin
and
you
a
wanderer
in
the
earth
without
a
place
whereon
to
lay
your
head
that
single
thought
would
cover
my
days
with
darkness
and
drive
me
to
distraction
but
give
me
your
company
my
gabriel
and
then
welcome
that
foreign
land
with
all
its
shady
forests
welcome
the
thatched
cottage
and
the
little
garden
filled
with
the
fruits
of
our
own
fondly
mingled
toils
methinks
my
love
i
already
see
that
distant
sun
rising
with
gladsome
beams
on
our
flowers
i
hear
the
wild
pouring
their
sprightly
carols
on
the
morning
my
heart
leaps
with
joy
to
their
songs
then
o
my
husband
if
we
must
go
let
us
go
without
a
sigh
god
can
order
it
for
our
good
and
on
my
account
you
shall
cast
no
lingering
look
behind
i
am
ready
to
follow
you
wherever
you
go
your
god
shall
be
my
god
where
you
live
i
will
live
and
where
you
die
there
will
i
die
and
will
be
buried
by
your
side
nothing
my
beloved
but
death
shall
ever
part
me
from
you
angelic
louisa
cried
marion
snatching
her
to
his
bosom
in
transports
wondrous
woman
what
do
i
not
owe
to
god
ever
blessed
for
such
a
comforter
i
came
just
now
from
rochelle
with
the
load
of
a
mountain
on
my
heart
you
have
taken
off
that
mountain
and
substituted
a
joy
most
lightsome
and
heavenly
like
a
ministering
angel
you
have
confirmed
me
in
duty
you
have
ended
my
struggles
and
by
so
cheerfully
offering
to
forsake
all
and
follow
me
you
have
displayed
a
love
dear
louisa
which
will
i
trust
render
you
next
to
my
god
the
eternal
complacency
and
delight
of
my
soul
in
the
midst
of
this
tender
scene
a
servant
came
running
to
inform
louisa
that
her
mother
madame
had
just
arrived
and
was
coming
to
her
in
the
garden
this
startled
our
lovers
into
a
painful
expectation
of
another
trial
for
as
louisa
was
an
only
daughter
and
her
parents
dotingly
fond
of
her
it
was
not
to
be
imagined
that
they
would
give
her
up
without
a
hard
struggle
seeing
the
old
lady
coming
down
the
walk
towards
them
they
endeavored
to
adjust
their
looks
and
to
meet
her
with
the
wonted
smile
but
in
vain
the
tumult
in
their
bosoms
was
still
too
visible
in
their
looks
to
escape
her
discernment
she
eagerly
asked
the
cause
their
changing
countenances
served
but
to
increase
her
fears
and
the
vehemence
of
her
curiosity
the
bishop
letter
was
put
into
her
hands
its
effects
on
the
good
old
lady
were
truly
distressing
not
having
like
her
daughter
the
vigor
of
youth
nor
the
fervors
of
love
to
support
her
she
was
almost
overcome
soon
as
her
spirits
were
a
little
recovered
she
insisted
that
her
daughter
and
should
instantly
step
into
her
coach
and
go
home
with
her
your
father
my
dear
said
she
to
louisa
your
father
monsieur
will
i
am
certain
do
something
for
us
but
in
this
she
was
woefully
mistaken
for
monsieur
was
one
of
that
blind
sort
who
place
all
their
religion
in
forms
and
notions
he
could
smile
and
look
very
fond
upon
a
man
though
not
over
moral
provided
that
man
went
to
his
church
praised
his
preacher
and
opinions
and
abused
everybody
else
but
would
look
very
sour
on
the
best
man
on
earth
who
differed
from
him
in
those
things
in
short
he
was
destitute
of
love
the
sole
life
of
religion
and
though
on
account
of
his
wife
importunities
and
his
daughter
repose
he
had
consented
to
her
marriage
with
marion
yet
he
never
liked
the
young
and
therefore
he
read
the
order
of
his
banishment
without
any
burst
of
grief
and
made
no
effort
to
revoke
the
decrees
of
the
church
against
him
but
abandoned
him
to
his
fate
such
insensibility
to
her
husband
interest
distressed
poor
louisa
exceedingly
however
it
had
this
good
effect
it
contributed
greatly
to
lessen
her
regret
at
parting
with
her
parents
o
had
they
but
loved
me
as
you
do
my
marion
said
she
could
they
have
been
so
indifferent
when
my
all
was
at
stake
no
indeed
continued
she
they
could
not
and
burst
into
tears
dearest
louisa
replied
he
tenderly
embracing
her
would
not
i
leave
father
and
mother
and
all
for
you
well
returned
she
with
eyes
of
love
outshining
all
diamonds
and
am
i
not
going
to
leave
all
for
you
yet
a
few
days
and
i
shall
have
no
father
no
mother
no
country
cut
off
from
all
the
world
but
you
marion
alas
what
will
become
of
me
if
you
should
prove
cruel
to
me
cruel
cruel
to
you
louisa
o
my
god
can
that
ever
be
ah
marion
but
some
excellent
women
have
left
father
and
mother
and
followed
their
husbands
and
yet
after
all
have
been
cruelly
neglected
by
them
yes
louisa
and
god
forgive
them
for
that
horrid
crime
but
to
me
such
a
deed
were
utterly
impossible
i
live
for
happiness
louisa
i
live
for
happiness
my
angel
and
i
find
so
much
happiness
in
loving
that
i
would
as
soon
cease
to
live
as
cease
to
love
some
indeed
celebutes
for
example
seem
to
exist
without
love
but
it
is
only
a
seeming
existence
most
joyless
and
imperfect
and
they
bear
the
dullness
of
apathy
the
better
because
they
have
never
known
the
transports
of
affection
but
with
me
my
charmer
the
case
is
happily
different
for
at
the
moment
i
first
saw
those
angel
eyes
they
infused
a
sweetness
into
my
heart
unknown
before
and
those
delicious
sparks
fanned
by
your
loves
and
graces
have
now
risen
to
such
a
flame
of
bliss
that
methinks
were
it
to
go
out
my
life
would
go
out
with
it
then
my
first
and
last
and
only
sweetheart
i
pray
you
do
not
fear
that
i
shall
ever
cease
to
love
you
for
indeed
that
can
never
be
while
you
continue
even
half
as
lovely
as
you
are
at
present
well
then
marion
replied
she
fondly
pressing
his
ruddy
cheeks
to
her
heaving
bosom
if
it
depends
on
me
on
my
constant
affection
and
studiousness
to
please
you
shall
never
love
me
less
but
more
and
more
every
day
of
your
life
the
next
morning
accompanied
by
madame
marion
and
louisa
returned
home
in
order
to
make
the
best
preparations
which
the
shortness
of
the
time
would
allow
to
quit
their
country
for
ever
in
choosing
his
place
of
exile
it
has
been
said
that
marion
thoughts
were
at
first
turned
towards
the
west
indies
but
it
would
appear
that
heaven
had
decreed
for
him
a
different
direction
for
scarcely
had
he
reached
his
home
much
agitated
about
the
means
of
getting
off
in
time
before
a
letter
was
brought
him
from
an
intimate
friend
in
rochelle
informing
him
that
a
large
ship
chartered
for
the
carolinas
by
several
wealthy
huguenot
families
was
then
lying
at
anchor
under
the
isle
de
rhee
gratefully
regarding
this
as
a
beckoning
from
heaven
they
at
once
commenced
their
work
and
prosecuted
it
with
such
spirit
that
on
the
evening
of
the
ninth
day
they
embraced
their
weeping
friends
and
went
on
board
the
ship
it
is
said
that
many
of
the
most
respectable
families
of
carolina
the
gourdines
hugers
trapiers
postells
horrys
came
over
in
the
same
ship
the
next
day
the
clouds
began
to
bank
the
eastern
sky
and
the
winds
to
whistle
from
the
hills
pleased
with
the
darkly
rippling
waters
the
ready
ship
got
home
her
anchors
and
loosed
her
sails
then
wheeling
before
the
freshening
gale
she
bid
adieu
to
her
native
shores
and
on
wings
of
canvas
commenced
her
foaming
course
for
the
western
world
but
though
mutual
love
and
confidence
in
heaven
were
strong
in
the
bosoms
of
young
marion
and
his
louisa
yet
could
they
not
suppress
the
workings
of
nature
which
would
indulge
her
sorrows
when
looking
back
on
the
lessening
shores
they
beheld
dwindled
to
a
point
and
trembling
in
the
misty
sky
that
glorious
land
at
once
their
own
cradle
and
the
sepulchre
of
their
fathers
some
natural
tears
they
shed
but
wiped
them
soon
for
the
earth
was
all
before
them
where
to
choose
their
place
of
rest
and
providence
their
guide
but
marion
and
louisa
did
not
leave
their
country
empty
handed
her
parents
is
supposed
gave
louisa
money
but
what
sum
after
this
long
lapse
of
time
is
uncertain
nor
does
tradition
say
for
how
much
marion
sold
his
little
farm
but
it
is
well
known
that
on
their
arrival
in
carolina
they
went
up
into
the
country
and
bought
a
plantation
on
goose
creek
near
charleston
where
their
dust
now
sleeps
after
a
long
life
endeared
by
mutual
love
and
surrounded
by
every
comfort
that
industry
and
prudence
can
bestow
we
have
said
that
marion
left
his
country
for
the
sake
of
his
religion
which
appears
to
have
been
of
that
cheerful
sort
for
which
a
wise
man
would
make
any
sacrifice
it
was
the
religion
of
the
gospel
that
blessed
philosophy
which
asks
not
a
face
of
gloom
but
a
heart
of
joy
and
thereunto
enjoin
a
supreme
love
of
god
and
a
close
walk
with
him
in
a
pure
and
benevolent
life
from
this
the
genuine
spring
of
all
the
sweetest
charities
and
joys
of
life
marion
derived
that
cheerfulness
which
appears
never
to
have
failed
him
even
in
his
last
will
where
most
men
fancy
they
ought
to
be
gloomy
as
the
grave
whither
they
are
going
his
cheerfulness
continued
to
shine
with
undiminished
lustre
it
was
like
the
setting
of
a
cloudless
sun
which
after
pouring
its
fattening
beams
on
the
fields
of
a
summer
day
goes
down
in
smiles
to
rise
a
brighter
beauty
on
another
day
this
will
is
certainly
an
amiable
curiosity
and
as
it
may
be
of
service
to
the
reader
by
showing
him
how
free
and
easy
a
good
life
makes
a
man
with
death
i
will
record
it
at
least
the
principal
features
of
it
as
i
got
them
from
the
family
after
having
in
the
good
old
way
bequeathed
his
soul
to
god
who
gave
it
and
his
body
to
the
earth
out
of
which
it
was
taken
he
proceeds
in
the
manner
following
in
the
first
place
as
to
debts
thank
god
i
owe
none
and
therefore
shall
give
my
executors
but
little
trouble
on
that
score
secondly
as
to
the
poor
i
have
always
treated
them
as
my
brethren
my
dear
family
will
i
know
follow
my
example
thirdly
as
to
the
wealth
with
which
god
has
been
pleased
to
bless
me
and
my
dear
louisa
and
children
lovingly
we
have
labored
together
for
it
lovingly
we
have
enjoyed
it
and
now
with
a
glad
and
grateful
heart
do
i
leave
it
among
them
he
then
proceeds
to
the
distribution
liberally
to
his
children
but
far
more
so
to
his
wife
and
at
the
end
of
each
bequest
assigns
his
reasons
i
give
my
ever
beloved
louisa
all
my
ready
money
that
she
may
never
be
alarmed
at
a
sudden
call
i
give
her
all
my
fat
calves
and
lambs
my
pigs
and
poultry
that
she
may
always
keep
a
good
table
i
give
her
my
new
carriage
and
horses
that
she
may
visit
her
friends
in
comfort
i
give
her
my
family
bible
that
she
may
live
above
the
ill
tempers
and
sorrows
of
life
i
give
my
son
peter
a
hornbook
for
i
am
afraid
he
will
always
be
a
dunce
but
peter
was
so
stung
with
this
little
squib
that
he
instantly
quit
his
raccoon
hunting
by
nights
and
betook
himself
to
reading
and
soon
became
a
very
sensible
and
charming
young
man
his
eldest
son
who
after
his
father
was
named
gabriel
married
a
miss
charlotte
corde
by
whom
he
had
six
children
esther
gabriel
isaac
benjamin
job
and
our
hero
francis
the
least
as
well
as
the
last
of
the
family
as
to
his
sister
esther
i
have
never
heard
what
became
of
her
but
for
his
four
brothers
i
am
happy
to
state
that
though
not
formidable
as
soldiers
they
were
very
amiable
as
citizens
they
bought
farms
proved
their
oxen
married
wives
multiplied
good
children
and
thus
very
unlike
our
niggardly
bachelors
contributed
a
liberal
and
laudable
part
to
the
population
strength
and
glory
of
their
country
god
i
pray
heartily
take

marion
retires
among

mohawks
of
sparta
it
was
a
constant
practice
on
the
birth
of
a
male
infant
to
set
a
military
granny
to
examine
him
as
a
butcher
would
a
veal
for
the
market
and
if
he
were
found
any
ways
puny
he
was
presently
thrown
into
a
horse
pond
with
as
little
ceremony
as
a
blind
puppy
had
such
been
the
order
of
the
day
in
carolina
would
never
have
boasted
a
marion
for
i
have
it
from
good
authority
that
this
great
soldier
at
his
birth
was
not
larger
than
a
new
england
lobster
and
might
easily
enough
have
been
put
into
a
quart
pot
this
puny
appearance
continued
with
him
till
the
age
of
twelve
when
it
was
removed
by
the
following
extraordinary
providence
on
a
trip
to
the
west
indies
which
his
friends
put
him
upon
for
his
health
sake
the
little
schooner
in
which
he
was
embarked
was
suddenly
attacked
by
some
monstrous
fish
probably
a
whale
who
gave
it
such
a
terrible
stroke
with
his
tail
as
started
a
plank
the
frightened
crew
flew
to
their
pumps
but
in
vain
for
the
briny
flood
rushed
with
such
fury
into
their
vessel
that
they
were
glad
to
quit
her
and
tumble
as
fast
as
they
could
into
their
little
jolly
boat
the
event
showed
that
this
was
as
but
a
leap
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
for
their
schooner
went
down
so
suddenly
as
not
to
give
them
time
to
take
a
mouthful
of
food
with
them
not
even
so
much
as
a
brown
biscuit
or
a
pint
of
water
after
three
wretched
days
of
feverish
hunger
and
thirst
they
agreed
to
kill
a
little
cabin
dog
who
had
swam
to
them
from
the
schooner
just
before
she
sunk
on
his
raw
flesh
they
feasted
without
restraint
but
the
blood
they
preserved
with
more
economy
to
cool
their
parched
lips
in
a
few
days
however
their
own
blood
for
lack
of
cooling
food
became
so
fiery
hot
as
to
scald
their
brain
to
frenzy
about
the
tenth
day
the
captain
and
mate
leaped
overboard
raving
mad
and
the
day
following
the
two
remaining
seamen
expired
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
piteously
crying
to
the
last
for
water
water
god
of
his
mercy
forgive
me
who
have
so
often
drank
of
that
sweet
beverage
without
grateful
acknowledgments
scarcely
was
this
melancholy
scene
concluded
before
a
vessel
hove
in
sight
standing
directly
for
the
boat
as
if
purposely
sent
to
save
the
child
that
was
tossing
in
it
on
the
gloomy
waves
little
marion
was
so
weak
that
he
could
not
stir
hand
or
foot
to
climb
up
the
side
of
the
vessel
the
captain
however
soon
had
him
on
board
and
by
means
of
chocolate
and
turtle
broth
sparingly
given
him
at
first
recruited
him
so
fast
that
by
the
time
he
reached
his
native
shores
he
was
in
much
better
health
than
ever
so
that
on
his
return
to
his
friends
it
was
found
as
is
often
the
case
that
what
was
at
first
looked
on
as
a
great
misfortune
had
proved
a
very
noble
blessing
his
constitution
seemed
renewed
his
frame
commenced
a
second
and
rapid
growth
while
his
cheeks
quitting
their
pale
cast
assumed
a
bright
and
healthy
olive
according
to
the
best
accounts
that
i
have
been
able
to
procure
marion
never
thought
of
another
trip
to
sea
but
continued
in
his
native
parish
in
that
most
independent
and
happy
of
all
callings
a
cultivator
of
the
earth
till
his
year
a
report
then
prevailing
that
the
cherokee
indians
were
murdering
the
frontier
settlers
marion
turned
out
with
his
rifle
as
a
volunteer
under
governor
lyttleton
the
affair
however
proved
to
be
a
mere
flash
in
the
pan
for
the
cherokees
finding
that
things
were
not
exactly
in
the
train
they
wished
sent
on
a
deputation
with
their
wampum
belts
and
to
bury
the
hatchet
and
brighten
the
old
chain
of
friendship
with
the
whites
and
the
governor
thinking
them
sincere
concluded
a
treaty
with
them
the
troops
of
course
were
dismissed
and
marion
returned
to
his
plantation
scarcely
however
had
two
years
elapsed
before
the
perfidious
cherokees
broke
out
again
in
a
fresh
place
killing
and
driving
the
defenceless
inhabitants
at
a
most
barbarous
rate
marion
instantly
flew
again
to
the
governor
with
the
tender
of
his
services
to
fight
for
his
afflicted
countrymen
his
excellency
was
so
pleased
with
this
second
instance
of
marion
patriotism
that
he
gave
him
a
first
lieutenancy
in
the
provincial
line
under
the
brave
captain
william
moultrie
the
reported
force
and
fury
of
the
indians
struck
such
a
terror
through
the
colony
that
colonel
grant
of
the
british
with
twelve
hundred
regulars
was
ordered
out
on
a
forced
march
to
succor
the
bleeding
frontiers
on
their
way
they
were
joined
at
may
by
twelve
hundred
provincials
all
men
of
surest
aim
with
the
deadly
rifle
to
draw
off
the
enemy
from
their
murderous
excursions
grant
wisely
determined
to
push
the
war
at
once
into
their
own
country
which
was
no
sooner
discovered
by
them
than
they
instantly
collected
their
whole
force
to
oppose
him
the
only
passage
into
their
country
was
through
a
dark
defile
or
gap
in
the
mountain
which
it
was
resolved
should
be
forced
as
rapidly
as
possible
a
forlorn
hope
of
thirty
brave
fellows
were
ordered
to
explore
the
dangerous
pass
and
marion
though
but
a
young
lieutenant
had
the
honor
to
be
appointed
their
leader
at
the
head
of
his
command
he
advanced
with
rapidity
while
the
army
moved
on
to
support
him
but
scarcely
had
they
entered
the
gloomy
defile
when
from
behind
the
rocks
and
trees
a
sheet
of
fire
suddenly
blazed
forth
which
killed
of
his
men
with
the
remainder
he
faced
about
and
pushed
back
with
all
speed
whereupon
great
numbers
of
tall
savages
frightfully
painted
rushed
from
their
lurking
places
and
with
hideous
yells
and
uplifted
tomahawks
pursued
and
gained
upon
them
so
fast
that
nothing
but
the
nearness
of
the
advanced
guard
saved
them
from
destruction
the
army
then
prepared
themselves
for
a
serious
and
bloody
conflict
an
enemy
in
such
force
so
well
posted
and
defending
the
only
pass
into
their
country
would
they
well
knew
fight
desperately
and
well
aware
also
what
slaughter
would
follow
upon
their
own
defeat
they
determined
to
yield
the
victory
only
with
their
lives
a
long
summer
day
was
before
them
for
the
sun
had
just
risen
above
the
hills
a
bright
spectator
of
the
coming
fight
then
in
high
spirits
with
justice
on
their
side
and
an
approving
conscience
they
cheerfully
left
the
event
to
heaven
the
british
were
formed
in
small
corps
the
more
promptly
to
support
the
riflemen
who
led
the
van
and
now
with
wide
extended
wings
began
to
move
in
a
little
time
they
came
in
sight
of
the
enemy
who
appeared
flying
backwards
and
forwards
as
if
not
well
satisfied
with
their
ground
the
provincial
marksmen
then
rapidly
advancing
flew
each
to
his
tree
and
the
action
began
from
wing
to
wing
quite
across
the
defile
the
woods
appeared
as
if
all
on
fire
while
the
incessant
crash
of
small
arms
tortured
the
ear
like
claps
of
sharpest
thunder
the
muskets
of
the
british
like
their
native
kept
up
a
dreadful
roar
but
scarcely
did
more
than
bark
the
trees
or
cut
off
the
branches
above
the
heads
of
the
indians
while
with
far
less
noise
the
fatal
rifles
continued
to
lessen
the
numbers
of
the
enemy
the
action
was
kept
up
with
great
spirit
for
nearly
two
hours
during
which
the
superiority
of
the
american
riflemen
was
very
remarkably
displayed
for
in
that
time
they
lost
only
whereas
of
the
indians
there
fell
one
hundred
and
three
which
so
disheartened
them
that
they
fled
and
gave
up
their
country
to
the
conquerors
who
prepared
immediately
to
enter
it
colonel
grant
had
hoped
to
surprise
their
towns
but
concluding
that
their
runners
had
given
the
alarm
he
moved
on
in
slow
marches
through
the
wilderness
towards
the
settlements
thinking
that
by
the
destruction
of
their
towns
and
he
should
drive
them
into
a
disposition
for
peace
marion
often
spoke
of
this
part
of
the
war
as
of
a
transaction
which
he
remembered
with
sorrow
we
arrived
said
he
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
at
the
indian
towns
in
the
month
of
july
as
the
lands
were
rich
and
the
season
had
been
favorable
the
corn
was
bending
under
the
double
weight
of
lusty
roasting
ears
and
pods
of
clustering
beans
the
furrows
seemed
to
rejoice
under
their
precious
loads
the
fields
stood
thick
with
bread
we
encamped
the
first
night
in
the
woods
near
the
fields
where
the
whole
army
feasted
on
the
young
corn
which
with
fat
venison
made
a
most
delicious
treat
the
next
morning
we
proceeded
by
order
of
colonel
grant
to
burn
down
the
indians
cabins
some
of
our
men
seemed
to
enjoy
this
cruel
work
laughing
very
heartily
at
the
curling
flames
as
they
mounted
loud
crackling
over
the
tops
of
the
huts
but
to
me
it
appeared
a
shocking
sight
poor
creatures
thought
i
we
surely
need
not
grudge
you
such
miserable
habitations
but
when
we
came
according
to
orders
to
cut
down
the
fields
of
corn
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
tears
for
who
could
see
the
stalks
that
stood
so
stately
with
broad
green
leaves
and
gaily
tasseled
shocks
filled
with
sweet
milky
fluid
and
flour
the
staff
of
life
who
i
say
without
grief
could
see
these
sacred
plants
sinking
under
our
swords
with
all
their
precious
load
to
wither
and
rot
untasted
in
their
mourning
fields
i
saw
every
where
around
the
footsteps
of
the
little
indian
children
where
they
had
lately
played
under
the
shade
of
their
rustling
corn
no
doubt
they
had
often
looked
up
with
joy
to
the
swelling
shocks
and
gladdened
when
they
thought
of
their
abundant
cakes
for
the
coming
winter
when
we
are
gone
thought
i
they
will
return
and
peeping
through
the
weeds
with
tearful
eyes
will
mark
the
ghastly
ruin
poured
over
their
homes
and
happy
fields
where
they
had
so
often
played
did
this
they
will
ask
their
mothers
white
people
did
it
the
mothers
reply
christians
did
it
thus
for
cursed
mammon
sake
the
followers
of
christ
have
sown
the
hellish
tares
of
hatred
in
the
bosoms
even
of
pagan
children
the
reader
will
however
with
pleasure
remember
that
these
were
the
dark
deeds
chiefly
of
a
kingly
government
a
gloomy
monarch
three
thousand
miles
distant
and
rolling
in
all
the
pomps
and
pleasures
of
three
millions
of
dollars
per
annum
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
know
what
was
passing
in
the
american
wilds
but
washington
had
known
with
bleeding
heart
he
had
often
beheld
the
red
and
white
men
mingling
in
bloody
fight
the
horrors
of
the
cruel
strife
dwelt
upon
his
troubled
thoughts
and
soon
as
god
gave
him
power
as
president
of
independent
america
he
immediately
adopted
that
better
system
which
he
had
learnt
from
the
gospel
his
successors
adams
jefferson
and
madison
have
piously
pursued
his
plan
in
place
of
the
tomahawk
the
is
sent
to
the
poor
indians
goods
are
furnished
them
at
first
cost
letters
and
morals
are
taught
among
their
tribes
and
the
soul
of
humanity
is
rejoiced
to
see
the
red
and
white
men
meet
together
like
brothers
this
generalization
is
doubtful
for
the
time
of
which
weems
speaks
and
is
certainly
false
for
some
subsequent
periods
in
which
great
britain
had
far
better
relations
with
native
peoples
as
in
canada
than
did
the
united
states
by
this
policy
the
united
states
have
not
only
saved
an
immensity
of
blood
and
treasure
but
are
rapidly
adding
to
the
population
and
strength
of

now

to

where
the
carpenter
a
cherokee
chief
met
colonel

and
concluded
a
peace
the

were
then
disbanded
and
marion
returned
to
his
plantation
in
john

where
with
a
few
slaves
he
continued
to
till
his
parental
acres
occasionally
amusing
himself
with
his
gun
and

of
which
he
was
always
very
fond

curious
anecdote
of

some
melancholy
and
memorable
relations
marion
continued
to
tread
the
peaceful
and
pleasant
walks
of
life
as
above
till
the
beginning
of
may
when
by
a
vessel
direct
from
boston
news
was
brought
of
the
gallant
battle
of
lexington
instantly
the
whole
town
and
country
were
in
a
flame
for
war
and
the
legislature
being
purposely
convened
hastened
to
meet
the
wishes
of
the
people
who
were
clamorous
for
raising
two
regiments
for
the
service
on
balloting
for
officers
marion
ticket
came
out
for
a
captaincy
in
the
second
regiment
under
command
of
the
brave
william
moultrie
in
a
little
time
my
name
was
called
out
as
a
captain
also
in
the
same
regiment
with
marion
this
to
me
was
matter
of
great
joy
as
i
had
long
courted
the
friendship
of
marion
for
though
he
was
neither
handsome
nor
witty
nor
wealthy
yet
he
was
universally
beloved
the
fairness
of
his
character
his
fondness
for
his
relations
his
humanity
to
his
slaves
and
his
bravery
in
the
indian
war
had
made
him
the
darling
of
the
country
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
that
i
should
have
taken
such
a
liking
to
marion
but
why
he
should
have
conceived
such
a
partiality
for
me
that
the
question
but
it
is
no
business
of
mine
to
solve
it
however
very
certain
it
is
that
on
the
first
moment
of
our
acquaintance
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
and
looks
towards
me
which
led
me
to
think
there
must
be
truth
in
the
old
saying
of
people
falling
in
love
at
first
sight
and
when
it
is
considered
that
strong
attachments
generally
spring
from
congenialities
i
must
confess
that
the
warm
and
constant
friendship
of
marion
has
ever
appeared
to
me
exceedingly
flattering
but
to
return
to
my
narrative
our
commissions
as
captains
were
soon
made
out
and
signed
by
the
council
of
safety
the
of
june
as
we
were
a
couple
of
flaming
patriots
we
could
not
bear
to
be
idle
a
single
moment
marching
fighting
killing
and
taking
prisoners
was
all
that
we
could
think
or
talk
of
but
as
all
this
fine
sport
could
not
be
carried
on
without
men
nor
men
to
be
had
without
recruiting
recruiting
of
course
appeared
to
be
the
first
act
and
prologue
of
our
play
but
what
shall
we
do
for
money
captain
marion
said
i
why
replied
he
we
must
get
it
from
the
assembly
the
assembly
was
accordingly
applied
to
but
alas
could
not
help
us
to
a
single
dollar
i
wonder
whether
posterity
will
ever
muster
faith
to
believe
that
the
grey
heads
of
south
carolina
without
a
penny
in
pocket
ventured
to
war
with
great
britain
the
nation
of
the
longest
purse
in
europe
surely
it
was
of
him
who
pitted
young
david
with
his
maiden
sling
and
pebbles
against
the
giant
goliath
but
though
the
poverty
of
the
legislature
was
enough
to
have
thrown
a
damp
on
spirits
of
ordinary
heat
yet
to
a
flaming
zeal
like
ours
it
only
served
as
water
on
a
fiery
furnace
to
make
it
blaze
the
fiercer
why
truly
horry
said
marion
this
looks
unpromising
but
we
must
not
mind
it
my
hero
i
tell
you
what
if
the
assembly
ca
help
us
we
must
help
ourselves
so
come
let
us
try
what
we
can
do
on
our
own
credit
with
all
my
heart
i
replied
so
away
went
we
to
borrow
money
of
our
friends
in
charleston
i
mean
hard
money
and
hard
money
it
was
indeed
the
gold
and
silver
all
appeared
as
if
it
had
caught
the
instinct
of
diving
at
the
first
flash
of
the
war
to
the
bottom
of
misers
trunks
and
strong
boxes
for
two
whole
days
and
with
every
effort
we
could
make
we
collected
but
the
pitiful
sum
of
one
hundred
dollars
however
fully
resolved
that
nothing
should
stop
us
we
got
our
regimentals
the
next
morning
from
the
tailor
and
having
crammed
our
saddlebags
with
some
clean
shirts
a
stout
luncheon
of
bread
and
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
we
mounted
and
with
hearts
light
as
young
lovers
on
a
courting
scheme
we
dashed
off
to
recruit
our
companies
our
course
was
towards
georgetown
black
river
and
great
pedee
fortune
seemed
to
smile
on
our
enterprise
for
by
the
time
we
reached
pedee
we
had
enlisted
men
proper
tall
fellows
to
whom
we
gave
furloughs
of
two
days
to
settle
their
affairs
and
meet
us
at
the
house
of
a
bass
with
whom
we
lodged
i
should
have
told
the
reader
that
we
had
with
us
a
very
spirited
young
fellow
by
the
name
of
charnock
who
was
my
lieutenant
on
the
second
day
a
captain
johnson
of
the
militia
came
to
bass
and
took
lieutenant
charnock
aside
and
after
prattling
a
great
deal
to
him
about
the
cursed
hardship
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
it
of
kidnapping
poor
clodhoppers
at
this
rate
he
very
cavalierly
offered
him
a
guinea
for
himself
and
a
half
joe
for
marion
and
me
to
let
the
recruits
go
never
did
a
poor
silly
puppy
more
completely
take
the
wrong
sow
by
the
ear
than
did
captain
johnson
in
thus
tampering
with
lieutenant
charnock
for
charnock
though
remarkably
good
natured
and
polite
among
men
of
honor
could
not
bear
the
least
approach
of
any
thing
that
looked
like
rascality
immediately
therefore
on
hearing
this
infamous
proposition
he
brought
johnson
into
the
dining
room
where
marion
and
myself
were
sitting
and
in
his
presence
told
us
the
whole
affair
oh
that
my
young
countrymen
could
all
have
been
there
that
they
might
have
seen
what
a
pale
trembling
pitiful
figure
a
detected
rascal
makes
i
am
sure
they
could
never
have
lost
that
blessed
moment
impression
in
favor
of
truth
and
honor
after
much
swallowing
johnson
however
at
last
got
the
better
of
his
conscience
and
came
on
with
a
stout
denial
of
the
fact
whereupon
charnock
snatching
a
pair
of
pistols
ordered
him
to
take
one
and
fight
him
on
the
spot
this
being
refused
the
furious
lieutenant
instantly
fell
upon
him
with
a
cane
sensible
that
johnson
had
very
richly
deserved
this
ignominious
chastisement
we
gave
him
up
to
charnock
who
thrashed
him
very
soundly
until
falling
on
his
knees
he
roared
out
for
quarter
charnock
then
ordered
him
to
be
gone
but
with
the
severest
threats
in
case
the
recruits
were
not
forthcoming
at
the
appointed
time
on
the
morrow
they
came
and
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
it
appeared
then
that
that
most
worthless
fellow
johnson
had
told
the
poor
simple
recruits
such
dreadful
stories
about
the
war
that
in
their
fright
they
had
offered
him
all
their
cows
and
calves
to
get
them
off
our
success
in
the
recruiting
business
far
exceeded
our
expectations
for
in
a
very
short
time
we
made
up
our
full
complement
of
sixty
men
each
i
have
often
lamented
it
as
a
most
serious
misfortune
that
we
did
not
enlist
for
the
war
i
am
certain
we
could
as
easily
have
enlisted
for
the
war
as
for
six
months
we
should
then
have
had
a
host
of
veterans
masters
of
their
dreadful
art
inured
to
hardships
scornful
of
danger
and
completely
able
to
purge
our
country
of
her
cruel
invaders
as
a
place
of
greater
security
from
the
enemy
vessels
dorchester
had
been
pitched
on
as
a
deposite
for
ammunition
and
military
stores
and
put
under
a
guard
of
militia
but
fearing
that
the
tories
might
rise
upon
this
slender
force
and
take
away
our
powder
an
article
at
that
time
of
incalculable
value
the
council
of
safety
advised
to
add
a
company
of
regulars
under
some
brave
and
vigilant
officer
marion
had
the
honor
to
be
nominated
to
the
command
and
on
the
of
november
marched
to
the
post
where
he
continued
undisturbed
by
the
tories
until
christmas
when
he
was
ordered
down
to
charleston
to
put
fort
johnson
in
a
state
of
defence
about
this
time
an
affair
happened
in
charleston
which
filled
with
horror
all
who
witnessed
it
captain
fuller
of
the
second
regiment
a
gentleman
in
other
respects
very
amiable
and
exemplary
gave
himself
up
to
hard
drinking
and
to
such
an
excess
as
brought
on
an
inflammation
in
the
brain
in
this
frantic
state
with
wild
rolling
eyes
and
a
face
shockingly
bloated
and
red
he
would
behave
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
leading
his
men
into
action
come
on
my
brave
fellows
he
would
cry
now
be
cool
and
steady
reserve
your
fire
till
i
say
the
word
now
give
it
to
them
my
heroes
hurra
they
run
they
run
i
thank
you
my
lads
for
your
gallantry
in
your
country
cause
all
this
time
the
sweat
would
roll
in
torrents
down
his
cheeks
then
quite
exhausted
he
would
fall
on
his
knees
and
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
lifted
to
heaven
would
pronounce
the
lord
prayer
and
the
creed
in
the
most
moving
manner
for
several
days
the
soldiers
gathered
around
him
while
thus
employed
and
often
with
tears
in
their
eyes
would
observe
the
total
ruin
which
intemperance
had
brought
upon
this
once
elegant
young
gentleman
his
friends
in
the
country
hearing
of
his
deplorable
condition
came
and
took
him
home
where
death
soon
put
an
end
to
all
his
miseries
in
a
short
time
after
this
our
regiment
was
deprived
of
another
very
genteel
young
officer
lieutenant
perrineau
who
also
fell
an
early
sacrifice
to
that
most
shameful
and
detestable
practice
of
morning
slings
and
draughts
of
strong
grog
after
these
two
tragedies
the
reader
will
not
i
hope
be
displeased
with
the
following
farce
which
was
acted
in
fort
johnson
while
marion
was
repairing
it
in
january
the
principal
actors
in
it
were
captain
marion
and
a
young
lieutenant
whose
name
delicacy
yet
a
while
bids
me
suppress
this
officer
though
in
his
person
as
handsome
as
absalom
or
the
blooming
adonis
was
as
destitute
of
soul
as
a
monkey
he
appeared
to
have
no
idea
above
that
of
dress
and
diversion
and
provided
he
could
but
compass
his
own
little
pitiful
ends
which
were
always
of
the
sensual
sort
he
cared
not
how
shamefully
he
prevaricated
and
lied
but
would
wink
and
grin
and
chuckle
as
if
he
had
done
some
great
thing
he
had
served
under
a
score
of
captains
who
had
all
spoken
of
him
as
a
slippery
worthless
fellow
whom
they
knew
not
what
to
do
with
but
though
most
heartily
despised
the
fool
had
the
vanity
to
think
himself
amazingly
clever
and
actually
boasted
to
me
one
day
that
he
would
soon
let
me
see
how
far
he
was
over
my
famous
captain
marion
speed
presently
he
hears
that
there
is
to
be
next
week
a
great
at
dorchester
instantly
his
childish
spirits
are
all
on
a
fever
to
see
the
oh
heavens
he
would
not
miss
the
for
the
world
but
how
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
from
the
fort
at
this
busy
time
was
the
rub
however
for
such
means
as
he
was
capable
of
using
an
invention
like
his
could
not
long
be
at
a
loss
in
short
he
went
to
marion
with
a
doleful
face
and
in
piteous
accents
stated
that
his
father
an
excellent
old
man
as
ever
son
was
blessed
with
was
at
his
last
gasp
and
only
wanted
to
see
him
before
he
died
the
generous
marion
not
suspecting
that
so
goodly
an
outside
could
cover
such
falsehood
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
coming
petition
but
instantly
granted
his
wish
unheard
to
be
sure
lieutenant
go
by
all
means
go
and
wait
upon
your
father
but
return
as
soon
as
possible
for
you
see
how
much
we
have
to
do
the
lieutenant
affected
to
be
quite
overcome
with
marion
generosity
and
swore
he
would
be
back
in
two
days
or
at
farthest
in
three
as
he
stepped
along
by
me
he
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
and
looked
prodigiously
arch
as
if
he
had
achieved
a
grand
exploit
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
told
marion
i
suspected
it
was
all
a
trick
and
so
it
turned
out
for
instead
of
hurrying
off
as
he
had
pretended
to
see
his
dying
father
he
slipt
over
to
charleston
where
for
fear
of
being
seen
by
any
of
our
officers
he
skulked
about
in
the
lower
lanes
and
alleys
until
it
was
time
to
go
up
to
the
at
dorchester
at
length
after
a
fortnight
absence
he
came
over
to
the
fort
and
entering
the
marquee
where
marion
was
sitting
with
his
officers
he
began
to
bow
and
scrape
as
if
not
perceiving
him
marion
turned
his
head
another
way
the
lieutenant
then
exceedingly
embarrassed
came
out
with
his
apology
i
am
sorry
sir
to
have
outstayed
my
time
so
long
but
but
i
could
not
help
it
but
now
i
am
returned
to
do
my
duty
marion
turned
very
quickly
upon
him
and
with
a
most
mortifying
neglect
said
aye
lieutenant
is
that
you
well
never
mind
it
there
is
no
harm
done
i
never
missed
you
the
poor
lieutenant
was
so
completely
cut
up
that
he
could
not
say
a
word
but
sneaked
off
hanging
down
his
head
and
looked
much
more
like
a
detected
swindler
than
a
gentleman
soldier
the
officers
who
were
all
prodigiously
pleased
with
his
confusion
presently
went
out
and
began
to
rally
him
ah
ha
lieutenant
and
so
the
captain
has
given
you
a
set
down
a
set
down
replied
he
very
angrily
a
set
down
do
you
call
it
i
had
rather
a
thousand
times
he
had
knocked
me
down
an
ugly
cross
son
of
a
the
officers
almost
split
their
sides
with
laughing
the
story
soon
took
wind
and
the
poor
lieutenant
did
not
hear
the
last
of
it
for
many
a
day
i
have
often
heard
him
say
that
nothing
ever
so
completely
confounded
him
as
did
that
dry
cutting
speech
of
marion
i
was
never
at
a
loss
before
said
he
to
manage
all
other
officers
that
were
ever
set
over
me
as
for
our
colonel
meaning
moultrie
he
is
a
fine
honest
old
buck
but
i
can
wind
him
round
my
finger
like
a
pack
thread
but
as
for
the
stern
marion
i
dread
him
the
truth
is
marion
wished
his
officers
to
be
gentlemen
and
whenever
he
saw
one
of
them
acting
below
that
character
he
would
generously
attempt
his
reformation
and
few
men
perhaps
ever
knew
better
how
to
manage
truants
from
duty
to
a
coarse
conceited
chap
like
our
lieutenant
marion
gave
no
quarter
but
checked
him
at
once
but
still
in
a
way
that
was
quite
gentlemanly
and
calculated
to
overawe
he
kept
him
at
arms
length
took
no
freedoms
with
him
nor
allowed
any
and
when
visited
on
business
he
would
receive
and
treat
him
with
a
formality
sufficient
to
let
him
see
that
all
was
not
right
the
effect
of
such
management
evinced
the
correctness
of
marion
judgment
the
young
lieutenant
became
remarkably
polite
and
also
attentive
to
duty
in
short
no
subaltern
behaved
better
and
this
very
happy
change
in
his
manners
was
soon
succeeded
by
as
pleasing
a
change
in
the
sentiments
of
all
around
him
the
officers
of
the
regiment
grew
fond
of
him
marion
spoke
of
him
with
pleasure
as
an
excellent
soldier
and
he
of
marion
as
his
best
friend
this
is
sufficient
to
show
the
truth
of
the
remark
made
by
aristotle
that
there
is
no
art
so
difficult
and
godlike
as
that
of
managing
men
to
their
own
happiness

glory

the

determined
to
raise
a
regiment
of
artillery
and
another
of
infantry
in
consequence
of
this
several
of
the
officers
of
the
former
regiments
were
promoted
among
these
was
my
friend
marion
who
from
the
rank
of
captain
was
raised
to
a
majority
his
field
of
duties
became
of
course
much
more
wide
and
difficult
but
he
seemed
to
come
forward
to
the
discharge
of
them
with
the
familiarity
and
alertness
of
one
who
as
general
moultrie
used
to
say
was
born
a
soldier
in
fact
he
appeared
never
so
happy
never
so
completely
in
his
element
as
when
he
had
his
officers
and
men
out
on
parade
at
close
training
and
for
cleanliness
of
person
neatness
of
dress
and
gentlemanly
manners
with
celerity
and
exactness
in
performing
their
evolutions
they
soon
became
the
admiration
and
praise
both
of
citizens
and
soldiers
and
indeed
i
am
not
afraid
to
say
that
marion
was
the
of
the
second
regiment
and
laid
the
foundation
of
that
excellent
discipline
and
confidence
in
themselves
which
gained
them
such
reputation
whenever
they
were
brought
to
face
their
enemies
in
march
i
was
sent
over
with
my
company
to
sullivan
island
to
prevent
the
landing
of
the
british
from
the
the
cherokee
and
tamar
then
lying
in
rebellion
road
i
had
not
been
long
on
that
station
before
moultrie
came
over
with
his
whole
regiment
to
erect
a
fort
on
the
island
the
truth
is
the
governor
had
of
late
become
confoundedly
afraid
of
a
visit
from
the
british
the
great
wealth
in
charleston
must
he
thought
by
this
time
have
set
their
honest
fingers
to
itching
and
we
also
suspected
that
they
could
hardly
be
ignorant
what
a
number
of
poor
deluded
gentlemen
called
tories
we
had
among
us
the
arrival
of
colonel
moultrie
with
the
second
regiment
afforded
me
infinite
satisfaction
it
brought
me
once
more
to
act
in
concert
with
marion
is
true
he
had
got
one
grade
above
me
in
the
line
of
preferment
but
thank
god
i
never
minded
that
i
loved
marion
and
love
as
every
body
knows
envieth
not
we
met
like
brothers
i
read
in
his
looks
the
smiling
evidence
of
his
love
towards
me
and
i
felt
the
strongest
wish
to
perpetuate
his
partiality
friendship
was
gay
within
my
heart
and
thenceforth
all
nature
without
put
on
her
loveliest
aspects
the
island
of
sand
no
longer
seemed
a
dreary
waste
brighter
rolled
the
blue
waves
of
ocean
beneath
the
golden
beam
and
sweeter
murmured
the
billows
on
their
sandy
beach
my
heart
rejoiced
with
the
playful
fishes
as
they
leaped
high
wantoning
in
the
air
or
with
sudden
flounce
returned
again
wild
darting
through
their
lucid
element
our
work
went
on
in
joy
the
palmetto
trees
were
brought
to
us
by
the
blacks
in
large
rafts
of
which
we
constructed
for
our
fort
an
immense
pen
two
hundred
feet
long
and
sixteen
feet
wide
filled
with
sand
to
stop
the
shot
for
our
platforms
we
had
oak
planks
nailed
down
with
iron
spikes
with
glad
hearts
we
then
got
up
our
carriages
and
mounted
our
guns
of
which

were
pounders
twelve
and
twelve
french
equal
to
english
a
general
joy
was
spread
over
the
faces
of
our
regiment
as
we
looked
along
our
battery
of
thunderers
but
our
glorifying
under
god
was
chiefly
in
our
two
and
forty
pounders
and
indeed
their
appearance
was
terrible
where
they
lay
with
wide
cerberean
mouths
hideously
gaping
over
the
roaring
waves
and
threatening
destruction
to
the
foes
of
liberty
they
were
soon
called
to
a
trial
of
their
metal
for
on
the
of
may
while
we
were
all
busily
driving
on
with
our
fort
suddenly
a
cry
was
heard
a
fleet
a
fleet
ho
looking
out
to
sea
we
all
at
once
beheld
as
it
were
a
wilderness
of
ships
hanging
like
clouds
from
the
sky
it
was
the
sirs
parker
and
clinton
hastening
on
with
nine
ships
of
war
and
thirty
transports
bearing
three
thousand
land
forces
to
attack
charleston
such
an
armament
was
an
awful
novelty
that
produced
on
us
all
a
momentary
flutter
but
thank
god
no
serious
fear
on
the
contrary
it
was
very
visible
in
every
glowing
cheek
and
sparkling
eye
as
we
looked
laughing
on
one
another
that
we
considered
the
approaching
conflict
as
a
grand
trial
of
courage
which
we
rather
desired
than
dreaded
and
to
their
equal
praise
our
gallant
countrymen
in
charleston
as
we
learned
daily
by
the
boats
were
all
in
fine
spirits
and
constantly
making
their
best
preparations
to
receive
the
enemy
and
still
my
pen
trembles
in
my
hand
even
after
this
long
lapse
of
time
it
trembles
with
wonder
and
delight
to
tell
of
that
immortal
fire
which
in
those
perilous
days
glowed
in
the
bosoms
of
the
charleston
fair
instead
of
gloomy
sadness
and
tears
for
the
dark
cloud
that
threatened
their
city
they
wore
the
most
enlivening
looks
constantly
talked
the
boldest
language
of
patriotism
animated
their
husbands
brothers
and
lovers
to
fight
bravely
and
for
themselves
they
vowed
they
would
never
live
the
slaves
of
britain
some
people
in
our
days
may
not
believe
me
when
i
add
of
these
noble
ladies
that
they
actually
begged
leave
of
their
commandant
to
let
them
fight
by
the
sides
of
their
relatives
and
friends
this
though
a
glorious
request
was
absolutely
refused
them
for
who
could
bear
to
see
the
sweet
face
of
beauty
roughened
over
with
the
hard
frowns
of
war
or
the
warrior
musket
on
those
tender
bosoms
formed
of
heaven
only
to
pillow
up
the
cheeks
of
happy
husbands
and
of
smiling
babes
but
though
the
spirits
of
the
ladies
were
willing
their
nerves
were
weak
for
when
the
british
ships
of
war
hove
in
sight
opposite
to
the
town
they
all
went
down
to
the
shore
to
view
them
and
then
strong
fear
like
the
cold
wind
of
autumn
struck
their
tender
frames
with
trembling
and
bleached
their
rosy
cheeks
some
indeed
of
the
younger
sort
affected
to
laugh
and
boast
but
the
generality
returned
silent
and
pensive
as
from
a
funeral
hanging
their
lovely
heads
like
rows
of
sickly
jonquils
when
the
sun
has
forsaken
the
garden
and
faded
nature
mourns
his
departed
beams
sisters
were
often
seen
to
turn
pale
and
sigh
when
they
looked
on
their
youthful
brothers
while
tender
mothers
looking
down
on
their
infant
cherubs
at
the
breast
let
drop
their
pearly
sorrows
and
exclaimed
happy
the
wombs
that
bear
not
and
the
paps
that
give
no
suck
in
consequence
of
a
most
extraordinary
continuation
of
calms
baffling
winds
and
neap
tides
the
enemy
ships
never
got
within
our
bar
till
the
of
june
and
on
the
following
morn
the
memorable
they
weighed
anchor
on
the
young
flood
and
before
a
fine
breeze
with
top
gallant
sails
royals
and
sky
scrapers
all
drawing
came
bearing
up
for
the
fort
like
floating
mountains
the
anxious
reader
must
not
suppose
that
we
were
standing
all
this
while
with
finger
in
mouth
idly
gaping
like
children
on
a
raree
show
no
by
the
living
but
fast
as
they
neared
us
we
still
kept
our
thunders
close
bearing
upon
them
like
infernal
pointers
at
a
dead
set
and
as
soon
as
they
were
come
within
point
blank
shot
we
clapped
our
matches
and
gave
them
a
tornado
of
round
and
bullets
which
made
many
a
poor
englishman
head
ache
nor
were
they
long
in
our
debt
but
letting
go
their
anchors
and
clewing
up
their
sails
which
they
did
in
a
trice
they
opened
all
their
batteries
and
broke
loose
upon
us
with
a
roar
as
if
heaven
and
earth
had
been
coming
together
such
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
and
thunder
could
not
but
make
us
feel
very
queer
at
first
especially
as
we
were
young
hands
and
had
never
been
engaged
in
such
an
awful
scene
before
but
a
few
rounds
presently
brought
us
all
to
rights
again
and
then
with
heads
bound
up
and
stripped
to
the
buff
we
plied
our
like
heroes
the
british
outnumbered
us
in
men
and
guns
at
least
three
to
one
but
then
our
guns
some
of
them
at
least
were
much
the
heaviest
carrying
balls
of
two
and
forty
pounds
weight
and
when
the
monsters
crammed
to
the
throat
with
chained
shot
and
infernal
fire
let
out
it
was
with
such
hideous
peals
as
made
both
earth
and
ocean
tremble
at
one
time
it
appeared
as
though
by
a
strange
kind
of
accident
all
their
had
struck
us
at
once
which
made
the
fort
tremble
again
but
our
palmettoes
stood
the
fire
to
a
miracle
closed
up
without
sign
of
splinter
on
their
shot
which
was
stopped
by
the
intermediate
sand
while
on
the
other
hand
every
bullet
that
we
fired
went
through
and
through
their
ships
smashing
alike
sailors
timber
heads
and
iron
anchors
in
their
furious
course
and
thus
was
the
order
of
our
battle
there
a
line
of
seven
tall
ships
and
here
one
little
solitary
fort
there
british
discipline
and
here
american
enthusiasm
there
brave
men
fighting
for
a
tyrant
and
here
heroes
contending
for
liberty
i
am
old
now
and
have
forgotten
many
things
but
never
shall
i
forget
the
of
that
day
when
i
heard
the
blast
of
those
rude
cannon
that
bade
me
be
a
slave
and
still
my
aged
bosom
swells
with
the
big
joy
when
i
hear
which
i
often
do
in
fancy
ear
the
answer
of
our
faithful
as
with
deafening
roar
lurid
flame
and
smoke
they
hurled
back
their
iron
curses
on
the
wicked
claim
but
alas
for
lack
of
ammunition
our
opening
victory
was
soon
nipped
like
a
luckless
flower
in
the
bud
for
the
contest
had
hardly
lasted
an
hour
before
our
powder
was
so
expended
that
we
were
obliged
in
a
great
measure
to
silence
our
guns
which
was
matter
of
infinite
mortification
to
us
both
because
of
the
grief
it
gave
our
friends
and
the
high
triumph
it
afforded
our
enemies
powder
powder
millions
for
powder
was
our
constant
cry
oh
had
we
but
had
plenty
of
that
as
the
scotchmen
call
it
not
one
of
those
tall
ships
would
ever
have
revisited
green
dominion
they
must
inevitably
have
struck
or
laid
their
vast
hulks
the
fort
as
hurdles
for
the
heads
indeed
small
as
our
stock
of
ammunition
was
we
made
several
of
their
ships
look
like
sieves
and
smell
like
slaughter
pens
the
commodore
ship
the
bristol
had
fifty
men
killed
and
upwards
of
one
hundred
wounded
the
laurels
of
the
second
regiment
can
never
fade
the
destructive
effect
of
their
fire
gave
glorious
proof
that
they
loaded
and
levelled
their
pieces
like
men
who
wished
every
shot
to
tell
they
all
fought
like
veterans
but
the
behavior
of
some
was
gallant
beyond
compare
and
the
humble
names
of
jasper
and
shall
be
remembered
when
those
of
proud
kings
shall
be
forgotten
a
ball
from
the
enemy
ships
carried
away
our
scarcely
had
the
stars
of
liberty
touched
the
sand
before
jasper
flew
and
snatched
them
up
and
kissed
them
with
great
enthusiasm
then
having
fixed
them
to
the
point
of
his
spontoon
he
leaped
up
on
the
amidst
the
storm
and
fury
of
the
battle
and
restored
them
to
their
daring
station
waving
his
hat
at
the
same
time
and
huzzaing
god
save
liberty
and
my
country
for
ever
as
to
sergeant
while
fighting
like
a
hero
at
his
gun
a
cannon
ball
came
in
at
the
port
hole
and
mangled
him
miserably
as
he
was
borne
off
he
lifted
his
dying
eyes
and
said
to
his
comrades
huzza
my
brave
fellows
i
die
but
do
let
the
cause
of
liberty
die
with
me
the
effect
of
our
last
gun
and
which
happened
to
be
fired
by
marion
is
too
remarkable
to
be
lost
it
was
his
lot
that
day
to
command
the
left
wing
of
the
fort
where
many
of
our
heaviest
cannon
were
planted
as
from
lack
of
powder
we
were
obliged
to
fire
very
slow
marion
would
often
level
the
guns
himself
and
now
comes
my
story
just
after
sunset
the
enemy
ships
ceased
firing
and
slipping
their
cables
began
to
move
off
pleased
with
the
event
an
officer
on
the
quarter
deck
of
the
bristol
called
out
to
his
comrade
well
d
n
my
eyes
frank
the
play
is
over
so
let
go
below
and
hob
nob
to
a
glass
of
wine
for
i
am
devilish
dry
with
all
my
heart
jack
replied
the
other
so
down
they
whipped
into
the
cabin
where
the
wine
and
glasses
had
been
standing
all
day
on
the
table
at
that
moment
one
of
our
two
and
forty
pounders
being
just
loaded
marion
called
to
colonel
moultrie
and
asked
him
if
it
would
not
be
well
enough
to
give
them
the
last
blow
yes
replied
moultrie
give
them
the
parting
kick
marion
clapped
the
match
and
away
in
thunder
and
lightning
went
the
ball
which
entering
the
cabin
windows
shattered
the
two
young
friends
thence
raging
through
the
and
steerage
it
shivered
three
sailors
on
the
main
deck
and
after
all
bursting
through
the
forecastle
into
the
sea
sunk
with
sullen
joy
to
the
bottom
we
got
this
story
from
five
british
seamen
who
ran
off
with
the
bristol
long
boat
and
came
and
joined
us
that
very
night
the
next
day
that
noble
whig
william
logan
sent
us
a
couple
of
fat
beeves
and
a
hogshead
of
rum
to
refresh
us
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
after
our
hard
day
work
and
on
the
second
day
after
the
action
the
governor
and
council
with
numbers
of
the
great
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
charleston
came
over
to
the
fort
to
visit
us
we
all
put
on
our
best
bibs
and
tuckers
and
paraded
at
the
water
edge
to
receive
them
which
we
did
with
a
spanking
de
and
were
not
a
little
gratified
with
their
attentions
and
handsome
compliments
paid
us
for
what
they
politely
termed
our
gallant
defence
of
our
country
bonfire
and
indeed
to
see
the
looks
of
our
poor
soldiers
when
those
great
ladies
all
glittering
in
silks
and
jewels
and
powdered
and
perfumed
so
nice
would
come
up
to
them
with
faces
like
angels
sparkling
and
smiling
so
sweet
as
if
they
would
kiss
them
i
say
to
see
the
looks
of
our
poor
fellows
their
awkward
bows
and
broad
grins
and
other
droll
capers
they
cut
no
human
being
could
have
refrained
from
laughing
presently
that
excellent
lady
mrs
colonel
elliot
of
the
artillery
came
forward
and
presented
us
with
a
most
superb
pair
of
colors
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
by
her
own
hands
they
were
delivered
if
i
mistake
not
to
the
brave
sergeant
jasper
who
smiled
when
he
took
them
and
vowed
he
would
never
give
them
up
but
with
his
life
poor
fellow
he
too
soon
made
good
his
promise
near
the
fatal
walls
of
savannah
but
it
was
not
the
ladies
alone
that
were
attentive
to
us
for
that
great
man
governor
rutledge
in
presence
of
the
regiment
took
the
sword
from
his
side
and
with
his
own
noble
hand
presented
it
to
sergeant
jasper
he
also
offered
him
a
commission
on
the
spot
but
this
jasper
absolutely
refused
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
governor
said
he
but
i
had
rather
not
have
a
commission
as
i
am
i
pass
very
well
with
such
company
as
a
poor
sergeant
has
any
right
to
keep
if
i
were
to
get
a
commission
i
should
be
forced
to
keep
higher
company
and
then
as
i
do
know
how
to
read
i
should
only
be
throwing
myself
in
a
way
to
be
laughed
at
parents
who
can
waste
on
grog
and
tobacco
that
precious
money
you
ought
to
educate
your
children
with
think
of
this
chapter
governor
rutledge
harangues
the
troops
shows
britain
injustice
to
have
been
the
cause
of
the
american
war
independence
declared
great
joy
on
that
account
on
the
of
september
all
the
troops
in
charleston
were
ordered
to
rendezvous
without
the
gates
of
the
city
to
hear
as
we
were
told
some
great
news
soon
as
we
were
paraded
governor
rutledge
ascended
a
stage
and
in
the
forcible
manner
of
a
demosthenes
informed
that
congress
had
dissolved
all
relation
with
england
by
an
open
declaration
of
independence
you
are
no
doubt
gentlemen
said
he
surprised
and
perhaps
shocked
at
this
intelligence
but
however
painful
this
measure
may
be
to
our
feelings
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
our
safety
under
the
sacred
name
of
country
england
has
long
been
working
our
ruin
i
need
not
tell
you
that
our
fathers
were
britons
who
for
liberty
sake
came
and
settled
in
this
country
then
a
howling
wilderness
for
a
long
time
they
ate
their
bread
not
only
embittered
with
sweat
but
often
stained
with
blood
their
own
and
the
blood
of
their
children
fighting
the
savages
for
a
dwelling
place
at
length
they
prevailed
and
found
a
rest
but
still
their
hearts
were
towards
the
place
of
their
nativity
and
often
with
tears
did
they
think
and
talk
of
the
island
where
their
fathers
dwelt
dying
they
bequeathed
to
us
the
same
tender
sentiments
which
we
cherished
with
a
pious
care
the
name
of
england
was
a
pleasant
sound
in
our
ears
the
sight
of
their
ships
was
always
wont
to
fill
our
hearts
with
joy
we
hasted
to
greet
the
beloved
strangers
and
hurrying
them
to
our
habitations
spread
for
them
our
feast
and
rejoiced
as
men
do
in
the
society
of
their
dearest
friends
oh
had
our
mother
country
but
treated
us
with
equal
affection
as
a
tender
parent
had
she
but
smiled
on
our
valor
encouraged
our
industry
and
thus
exalted
the
horn
of
our
glory
our
union
and
brotherly
love
would
have
been
eternal
and
the
impious
name
of
independence
had
never
been
heard
but
alas
instead
of
treating
us
in
this
endearing
spirit
she
cruelly
limited
our
commerce
compelled
us
to
buy
and
sell
to
her
alone
and
at
her
own
prices
and
not
content
with
the
enormous
profits
of
such
a
shameful
traffic
she
has
come
at
length
to
claim
a
right
to
tax
us
at
pleasure
but
my
countrymen
will
you
suffer
thus
rudely
to
be
wrested
from
you
that
goodly
inheritance
of
liberty
which
was
bequeathed
to
you
by
your
gallant
fathers
will
you
thus
tamely
suffer
to
be
frustrated
all
the
glorious
designs
of
god
towards
you
and
your
children
for
look
but
around
on
this
great
land
which
he
has
given
you
and
yon
bright
heavens
which
he
has
spread
over
your
favored
heads
and
say
whether
he
ever
intended
those
mighty
scenes
to
be
the
of
slaves
the
trembling
slaves
of
a
small
island
beyond
the
sea
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
planters
of
rice
and
pickers
of
cotton
for
a
foreign
tyrant
and
his
minions
no
my
friends
god
never
intended
you
for
such
dishonor
and
can
you
be
so
wicked
as
to
bring
it
on
yourselves
i
trust
you
will
not
nay
the
voices
of
your
brave
countrymen
in
congress
have
said
you
will
not
and
anticipating
your
heroic
sentiments
have
already
declared
you
a
free
and
independent
people
and
now
my
gallant
friends
are
you
willing
to
confirm
their
glorious
deed
are
you
willing
this
day
in
the
sight
of
heaven
to
swear
allegiance
to
the
sovereignty
of
your
country
and
to
place
her
in
the
highest
rank
of
nations
by
proclaiming
her
independent
in
a
moment
the
air
resounded
with
yes
yes
independence
independence
for
ever
god
save
the
independent
states
of
america
the
oath
of
allegiance
was
then
tendered
to
the
troops
the
officers
with
great
alacrity
took
it
first
which
highly
pleased
the
common
soldiers
who
readily
followed
their
patriotic
example
soon
as
the
solemn
rite
was
performed
the
governor
ordered
a
de
joie
instantly
at
the
welcome
word
handle
arms
the
eager
warriors
struck
their
loud
ringing
through
all
their
ranks
and
presenting
their
pieces
rent
the
air
with
fierce
platoons
while
the
cannon
like
surly
rolled
their
louder
thunders
along
the
field
then
madly
bounding
back
on
their
rattling
wheels
they
told
to
fancy
ear
freedom
sons
are
we
and
d
n
the
villains
that
would
make
us
slaves
chapter
times
growing
squally
the
author
sets
out
a
vagrant
hunting
gets
into
hot
water
narrowly
escapes
with
his
life
catches
a
host
of
vagabonds
but
learns
from
experience
that
though
a
rascal
may
do
to
stop
a
bullet
is
only
the
man
of
honor
that
can
make
a
good
soldier
the
devil
said
george
whitefield
is
fond
of
fishing
in
muddy
waters
hence
it
is
i
suppose
that
that
grand
demagogue
has
always
been
so
fond
of
war
that
sunshine
and
basking
time
of
rogues
which
calls
them
out
thick
as
sun
calls
out
the
from
their
stony
crannies
in
times
of
peace
the
waters
are
clear
so
that
if
the
smallest
jack
villain
but
makes
his
appearance
justice
with
her
iron
talons
is
down
upon
him
in
a
moment
but
let
war
but
stir
up
the
mud
of
confusion
and
straightway
the
eyes
of
justice
are
blinded
thieves
turn
out
in
shoals
and
devils
like
hungry
are
seen
by
the
eye
of
faith
hovering
over
the
wretched
fry
screaming
for
their
prey
this
was
exactly
the
case
in
south
carolina
the
war
had
hardly
raged
there
above
a
twelvemonth
and
a
day
before
the
state
of
society
seemed
turned
upside
down
the
sacred
plough
was
every
where
seen
rusting
in
the
weedy
furrows
grog
shops
and
nanny
houses
were
springing
up
as
thick
as
hops
at
the
house
of
god
you
saw
nobody
but
if
there
was
a
devil
house
a
dram
shop
hard
by
you
might
be
sure
to
see
that
crowded
with
poor
lazarites
with
red
noses
and
black
eyes
and
the
fences
all
strung
along
with
starved
tackies
in
bridles
and
saddles
in
short
the
whole
country
was
fast
overrunning
with
vagabonds
like
ravening
locusts
seeking
where
they
might
light
and
whom
they
should
devour
good
heavens
said
marion
to
me
one
day
and
with
great
alarm
in
his
looks
what
to
be
done
with
these
wretches
these
vagrants
i
am
actually
afraid
we
shall
be
ruined
by
them
presently
for
you
know
sir
that
a
vagrant
is
but
the
chrysalis
or
fly
state
of
the
gambler
the
the
and
indeed
of
every
other
worthless
creature
that
disturbs
and
endangers
society
why
colonel
replied
i
there
a
conceit
in
my
head
which
if
it
could
but
be
brought
to
bear
would
i
think
soon
settle
the
hash
with
these
rascals
aye
replied
he
well
pray
give
it
to
us
for
i
should
be
very
fond
to
hear
it
why
sir
said
i
give
me
but
a
lieutenant
sergeant
and
corporal
with
a
dozen
privates
all
of
my
own
choosing
do
you
see
and
if
i
do
soon
give
you
a
good
account
of
those
villains
you
may
with
all
my
heart
give
me
a
good
suit
of
tar
and
feathers
my
demand
was
instantly
complied
with
then
taking
with
me
such
men
as
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
among
whom
was
the
brave
lieutenant
jossilin
i
set
out
from
the
long
bluff
towards
sandhills
the
reader
will
please
to
take
notice
that
in
our
hurry
we
had
not
forgot
to
take
with
us
a
constable
with
a
proper
warrant
we
had
gone
but
a
few
miles
before
we
fell
in
with
a
squad
of
as
choice
game
as
heart
could
have
wished
three
proper
tall
young
vagabonds
profoundly
engaged
at
all
fours
in
a
log
tippling
shop
with
cards
as
black
as
their
own
dirty
hands
and
a
tickler
of
brandy
before
them
and
so
intent
were
the
thieves
on
fleecing
each
other
that
they
took
no
manner
of
notice
of
us
but
continued
their
scoundrel
work
eagerly
stretched
over
the
table
thwacking
down
their
cards
with
filthy
knuckles
and
at
every
stroke
bawling
out
there
a
good
trick
that
as
good
as
he
and
there
the
best
of
the
three
huzza
d
n
me
at
him
again
my
hearties
lieutenant
jossilin
said
i
grab
them
fellows
you
never
saw
poor
devils
in
such
a
fright
but
soon
as
they
had
recovered
the
use
of
their
tongues
they
swore
like
troopers
that
they
were
the
most
honestest
gentlemen
in
all
carolina
aye
well
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
gentlemen
said
i
for
i
love
honest
men
prodigiously
and
hope
the
magistrate
will
confirm
the
handsome
report
you
have
made
of
yourselves
so
off
we
set
all
together
for
the
magistrate
about
dinner
time
i
ordered
a
halt
at
the
house
of
one
johnson
a
militia
captain
who
appeared
quite
overwhelmed
with
joy
to
see
me
heaven
bless
us
said
he
and
now
who
could
have
believed
all
this
and
have
i
at
last
to
my
heart
desire
the
great
honor
of
seeing
under
my
humble
roof
the
noble
major
horry
i
told
him
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
politeness
but
for
the
present
was
rather
too
hungry
to
relish
compliments
like
sweetmeats
captain
said
i
a
little
of
them
may
do
pretty
well
after
a
good
dinner
oh
my
dear
major
quoth
he
and
how
sorry
i
am
now
that
i
have
nothing
fit
for
dinner
for
you
my
noble
son
of
thunder
a
saddle
of
fat
venison
major
or
a
brace
of
young
ducks
or
a
green
goose
with
currant
jelly
and
a
bottle
of
old
madeira
to
wash
it
down
do
you
see
major
something
nice
for
you
do
you
see
major
nice
said
i
captain
johnson
we
soldiers
of
liberty
do
stand
upon
the
nice
the
substantial
is
that
we
care
for
a
rasher
of
fat
bacon
from
the
coals
with
a
good
stout
lump
of
an
ash
cake
is
nice
enough
for
us
oh
my
dear
sir
replied
he
now
do
do
be
angry
with
me
for
i
was
only
sorry
that
i
have
nothing
half
so
good
for
you
as
i
could
wish
but
such
as
it
is
thank
god
we
have
plenty
and
you
shall
have
a
bite
in
a
trice
so
off
he
went
as
he
pretended
to
hurry
dinner
now
can
any
honest
man
believe
that
this
same
man
captain
johnson
who
had
been
as
paddy
says
sticking
the
blarney
into
me
at
that
rate
could
have
been
such
a
scoundrel
as
to
turn
about
the
very
next
minute
and
try
all
in
his
power
to
trick
me
out
of
my
vagrants
it
is
however
too
true
to
be
doubted
for
having
purposely
delayed
dinner
till
it
was
late
he
then
insisted
that
i
must
not
deny
him
the
very
great
honor
of
my
company
that
night
soon
as
my
consent
was
obtained
he
despatched
a
parcel
of
riders
to
order
in
with
their
guns
as
many
of
his
gang
as
he
thought
would
do
in
the
course
of
the
night
snug
as
master
johnson
thought
himself
i
got
a
hint
of
his
capers
and
told
my
men
to
see
that
their
guns
were
in
prime
order
while
breakfast
was
getting
ready
for
johnson
swore
i
should
not
leave
him
on
an
empty
stomach
lieutenant
jossilin
came
and
told
me
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
so
many
fellows
coming
about
the
house
with
their
guns
in
their
hands
i
replied
that
we
should
see
presently
breakfast
then
making
its
appearance
we
sat
down
and
while
we
were
eating
our
men
all
on
parade
at
the
door
johnson
men
kept
dropping
in
one
after
another
till
there
were
i
dare
say
as
many
as
thirty
of
them
in
the
room
all
armed
when
breakfast
was
over
i
turned
to
the
constable
and
desired
him
to
look
to
his
charge
meaning
the
three
vagrants
for
that
we
would
start
as
soon
as
our
men
were
all
refreshed
upon
this
captain
johnson
said
he
believed
he
should
not
let
the
prisoners
go
not
let
them
go
sir
said
i
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
i
mean
sir
replied
he
that
the
law
is
an
oppressive
one
i
asked
him
still
keeping
myself
perfectly
cool
if
he
was
not
an
american
soldier
yes
sir
he
answered
i
am
an
american
soldier
and
as
good
a
one
perhaps
as
yourself
or
any
other
man
well
sir
and
is
this
the
way
you
show
your
soldiership
by
insulting
the
law
i
am
not
bound
continued
he
to
obey
a
bad
law
but
sir
who
gave
you
a
right
to
judge
the
law
i
do
mind
that
quoth
he
but
d
n
me
sir
if
i
let
the
prisoners
go
very
well
captain
johnson
said
i
we
shall
soon
try
that
and
if
you
and
your
people
here
choose
to
go
to
the
devil
for
resisting
the
law
on
your
own
heads
be
the
bloody
consequences
with
this
i
gave
the
floor
a
thundering
stamp
and
in
a
moment
as
by
magic
in
bursted
my
brave
sergeant
and
men
with
fixed
bayonets
ready
for
slaughter
while
jossilin
and
myself
whipping
out
our
swords
rushed
on
as
to
the
charge
a
troop
of
red
foxes
dashing
into
a
poultry
yard
never
produced
such
squalling
and
flying
as
now
took
place
among
these
poor
guilty
wretches
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
they
cried
down
fell
their
guns
smack
went
the
doors
and
windows
and
out
of
both
heels
over
head
they
tumbled
as
expecting
every
moment
the
points
of
our
bayonets
the
house
was
quickly
cleared
of
every
soul
except
johnson
and
his
lieutenant
one
lunda
who
both
trembled
like
aspen
leaves
expecting
a
severe
drubbing
captain
johnson
said
i
do
tremble
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
a
man
who
can
act
as
you
have
done
is
not
an
object
of
anger
but
contempt
go
and
learn
the
spirit
that
becomes
a
gentleman
and
an
american
soldier
i
should
have
observed
that
as
we
advanced
to
charge
johnson
poltroons
one
of
the
party
a
resolute
fellow
presented
his
gun
to
my
breast
and
drew
the
trigger
happily
in
the
very
instant
of
its
firing
lieutenant
jossilin
knocked
it
up
with
his
sword
and
the
ball
grazing
my
shoulder
bursted
through
the
side
of
the
house
as
we
rode
off
some
of
johnson
fugitives
had
the
audacity
to
bawl
out
though
from
a
very
prudent
distance
threatening
us
that
they
would
yet
rescue
the
prisoners
before
we
got
to
the
bluff
but
they
wisely
took
care
not
to
make
good
their
word
for
they
were
only
a
pack
of
poor
ignorant
tories
who
did
nothing
on
principle
and
were
therefore
ready
to
quit
their
purpose
the
moment
they
saw
danger
in
the
way
our
success
at
vagrant
hunting
was
marvellous
i
hardly
think
we
could
in
the
same
time
have
caught
as
many
raccoons
in
any
swamp
on
pedee
on
counting
noses
we
found
that
in
our
three
week
course
we
had
seized
and
sent
off
to
charleston
upwards
of
fifty
with
the
last
haul
i
returned
myself
to
the
city
where
i
received
the
thanks
of
general
howe
for
the
handsome
addition
as
he
was
pleased
to
term
it
which
i
had
made
to
the
regiment
but
on
trial
it
was
found
that
such
vermin
were
not
worthy
of
thanks
nor
were
any
addition
to
the
regiment
except
as
disgust
to
the
men
and
vexation
to
the
officers
destitute
of
honor
they
performed
their
duty
not
like
soldiers
but
slaves
and
on
every
opportunity
would
run
off
into
the
woods
like
wild
beasts
chapter
the
brave
sergeant
jasper
again
on
the
carpet
in
disguise
visits
a
british
post
at
ebenezer
in
company
of
sergeant
newton
makes
a
second
trip
thither
affecting

lady
and

child
with
other

at

desperate
resolve
of
jasper
and
newton
to
rescue
them
their
bloody
conflict
and
glorious
triumph
in
the
spring
of
marion
and
myself
were
sent
with
our
commands
to
purysburgh
to
reinforce
general
lincoln
who
was
there
on
his
way
to
attack
the
british
in
savannah
which
a
few
months
before
had
fallen
into
their
hands
as
the
count
who
was
expected
to
cooperate
in
this
affair
had
not
yet
arrived
general
lincoln
thought
it
advisable
to
entrench
and
wait
for
him
while
we
were
lying
at
purysburgh
a
couple
of
young
men
of
our
regiment
achieved
an
act
of
generosity
and
courage
which
in
former
days
would
have
laid
the
of
a
heroic
romance
one
of
the
actors
in
this
extraordinary
play
was
the
brave
sergeant
jasper
whose
name
will
for
ever
be
dear
to
the
friends
of
american
liberty
jasper
had
a
brother
who
had
joined
the
british
and
held
the
rank
of
sergeant
in
their
garrison
at
ebenezer
never
man
was
truer
to
his
country
than
jasper
yet
was
his
heart
so
warm
that
he
loved
his
brother
though
a
tory
and
actually
went
over
to
see
him
his
brother
was
exceedingly
alarmed
at
sight
of
him
lest
he
should
be
seized
and
hung
up
at
once
as
a
spy
for
his
name
was
well
known
to
many
of
the
british
officers
but
jasper
begged
him
not
to
give
himself
much
trouble
on
that
head
for
said
he
i
am
no
longer
an
american
soldier
well
thank
god
for
that
william
replied
his
brother
giving
him
a
hearty
shake
by
the
hand
and
now
only
say
the
word
my
boy
and
here
is
a
commission
for
you
with
regimentals
and
gold
to
boot
to
fight
for
his
majesty
jasper
shook
his
head
and
observed
that
though
there
was
but
little
encouragement
to
fight
for
his
country
yet
he
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
fight
against
her
and
there
the
conversation
ended
after
staying
with
his
brother
some
two
or
three
days
inspecting
and
hearing
all
that
he
could
he
took
his
leave
and
by
a
round
about
returned
to
camp
and
told
general
lincoln
all
that
he
had
seen
having
wasted
several
weeks
longer
of
tiresome
idleness
and
no
news
of
the
french
fleet
jasper
took
it
into
his
head
to
make
another
trip
to
ebenezer
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
as
before
go
alone
but
took
with
him
his
particular
friend
sergeant
newton
son
of
an
old
baptist
preacher
and
a
young
fellow
for
strength
and
courage
just
about
a
good
match
for
jasper
himself
he
was
received
as
usual
with
great
cordiality
by
his
brother
to
whom
he
introduced
his
friend
newton
and
spent
several
days
in
the
british
fort
without
giving
the
least
alarm
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
his
brother
had
some
bad
news
to
tell
him
aye
what
is
it
he
asked
what
is
it
why
replied
his
brother
here
are
some
ten
or
a
dozen
american
prisoners
brought
in
this
morning
as
deserters
from
savannah
whither
they
are
to
be
sent
immediately
and
from
what
i
can
learn
it
will
be
apt
to
go
hard
with
them
for
it
seems
they
have
all
taken
the
king
bounty
let
see
said
jasper
let
see
so
his
brother
took
him
and
newton
to
see
them
and
indeed
it
was
a
mournful
sight
to
behold
them
where
they
sat
poor
fellows
all
on
the
ground
but
all
pity
of
them
was
forgot
soon
as
the
eye
was
turned
to
a
far
more
doleful
sight
hard
by
which
was
a
young
woman
wife
of
one
of
the
prisoners
with
her
child
a
sweet
little
boy
of
about
five
years
old
the
name
of
this
lady
was
jones
her
humble
garb
showed
her
to
be
poor
but
her
deep
distress
and
sympathy
with
her
unfortunate
husband
showed
that
she
was
rich
in
that
pure
conjugal
love
that
is
more
precious
than
all
gold
she
generally
sat
on
the
ground
opposite
to
her
husband
with
her
little
boy
leaning
on
her
lap
and
her
coal
black
hair
spreading
in
long
neglected
tresses
on
her
neck
and
bosom
and
thus
in
silence
she
sat
a
statue
of
grief
sometimes
with
her
eyes
hard
fixed
upon
the
earth
like
one
lost
in
thought
sighing
and
groaning
the
while
as
if
her
heart
would
burst
then
starting
as
from
a
reverie
she
would
dart
her
eager
eyes
red
with
weeping
on
her
husband
face
and
there
would
gaze
with
looks
so
piercing
sad
as
though
she
saw
him
struggling
in
the
halter
herself
a
widow
and
her
son
an
orphan
straight
her
frame
would
begin
to
shake
with
the
rising
agony
and
her
face
to
change
and
swell
then
with
eyes
swimming
in
tears
she
would
look
around
upon
us
all
for
pity
and
for
help
with
cries
sufficient
to
melt
the
heart
of
a
demon
while
the
child
seeing
his
father
hands
fast
bound
and
his
mother
weeping
added
to
the
distressing
scene
by
his
artless
cries
and
tears
the
brave
are
always
it
was
so
with
jasper
and
newton
two
of
the
most
undaunted
spirits
that
ever
lived
they
walked
out
in
the
neighboring
wood
the
tear
was
in
the
eye
of
both
jasper
first
broke
silence
newton
said
he
my
days
have
been
but
few
but
i
believe
their
course
is
nearly
done
why
so
jasper
why
i
feel
said
he
that
i
must
rescue
these
poor
prisoners
or
die
with
them
otherwise
that
woman
and
her
child
will
haunt
me
to
my
grave
well
that
is
exactly
what
i
feel
too
replied
newton
and
here
is
my
hand
and
heart
to
stand
by
you
my
brave
friend
to
the
last
drop
thank
god
a
man
can
die
but
once
and
there
is
not
so
much
in
this
life
that
a
man
need
be
afraid
to
leave
it
especially
when
he
is
in
the
way
of
his
duty
the
two
friends
then
embraced
with
great
cordiality
while
each
read
in
the
other
countenance
that
immortal
fire
which
beams
from
the
eyes
of
the
brave
when
resolved
to
die
or
conquer
in
some
glorious
cause
immediately
after
breakfast
the
prisoners
were
sent
on
for
savannah
under
a
guard
of
a
sergeant
and
corporal
with
eight
men
they
had
not
been
gone
long
before
jasper
accompanied
by
his
friend
newton
took
leave
of
his
brother
and
set
out
on
some
errand
to
the
upper
country
they
had
scarcely
however
got
out
of
sight
of
ebenezer
before
they
struck
into
the
piny
woods
and
pushed
hard
after
the
prisoners
and
their
guard
whom
they
closely
dogged
for
several
miles
anxiously
watching
an
opportunity
to
make
a
blow
but
alas
all
hopes
of
that
sort
seemed
utterly
extravagant
for
what
could
give
two
men
a
chance
to
contend
against
ten
especially
when
there
was
found
no
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
two
while
the
ten
each
man
was
armed
with
his
loaded
musket
and
bayonet
but
unable
to
give
up
their
countrymen
our
heroes
still
followed
on
about
two
miles
from
savannah
there
is
a
famous
spring
generally
called
the
well
known
to
travellers
who
often
turn
in
hither
to
quench
their
thirst
perhaps
said
jasper
the
guard
may
stop
there
then
hastening
on
by
a
near
cut
through
the
woods
they
gained
the
spa
as
their
last
hope
and
there
concealed
themselves
among
the
bushes
that
grew
abundantly
around
the
spring
presently
the
mournful
procession
came
in
sight
headed
by
the
sergeant
who
on
coming
opposite
to
the
spring
ordered
a
halt
hope
sprung
afresh
in
our
heroes
bosoms
strong
throbbing
too
no
doubt
with
great
alarms
for
it
was
a
fearful
odds
the
corporal
with
his
guard
of
four
men
conducted
the
prisoners
to
the
spring
while
the
sergeant
with
the
other
four
having
grounded
their
arms
near
the
road
brought
up
the
rear
the
prisoners
wearied
with
their
long
walk
were
permitted
to
rest
themselves
on
the
earth
poor
jones
as
usual
took
her
seat
opposite
to
her
husband
and
her
little
boy
overcome
with
fatigue
fell
asleep
in
her
lap
two
of
the
corporal
men
were
ordered
to
keep
guard
and
the
other
two
to
give
the
prisoners
drink
out
of
their
canteens
these
last
approached
the
spring
where
our
heroes
lay
concealed
and
resting
their
muskets
against
a
pine
tree
dipped
up
water
and
having
drank
themselves
turned
away
with
replenished
canteens
to
give
the
prisoners
also
now
newton
is
our
time
said
jasper
then
bursting
like
two
lions
from
their
concealment
they
snatched
up
the
two
muskets
that
were
rested
against
the
pine
and
in
an
instant
shot
down
the
two
soldiers
that
kept
guard
and
now
the
question
was
who
should
first
get
the
two
loaded
muskets
that
had
just
fallen
from
the
hands
of
the
slain
for
by
this
time
the
sergeant
and
corporal
a
couple
of
brave
englishmen
recovering
from
their
momentary
panic
had
sprung
and
seized
upon
the
muskets
but
before
they
could
use
them
the
strong
americans
with
clubbed
guns
levelled
each
at
the
head
of
his
brave
antagonist
the
final
blow
the
tender
bones
of
the
skull
gave
way
beneath
the
furious
strokes
and
with
wide
scattered
blood
and
brains
down
they
sunk
pale
and
quivering
to
the
earth
without
a
groan
then
snatching
up
the
guns
which
had
thus
a
second
time
fallen
from
the
hands
of
the
slain
they
flew
between
the
surviving
enemy
and
ordered
them
to
surrender
which
they
instantly
did
having
called
the
prisoners
to
them
they
quickly
with
the
point
of
their
bayonets
broke
off
their
handcuffs
and
gave
each
of
them
a
musket
at
the
commencement
of
the
fray
poor
jones
half
frightened
to
death
had
fallen
to
the
ground
in
a
swoon
with
her
little
son
piteously
screaming
over
her
but
when
she
came
to
herself
and
saw
her
husband
and
friends
around
her
all
freed
from
their
fetters
and
well
armed
she
looked
and
behaved
like
one
frantic
with
joy
she
sprung
to
her
husband
bosom
and
with
her
arms
around
his
neck
sobbed
out
oh
bless
god
bless
god
my
husband
is
safe
my
husband
is
not
hung
yet
then
snatching
up
her
child
and
straining
him
to
her
soul
as
if
she
would
have
pressed
him
to
death
she
cried
out
o
praise
praise
praise
god
for
ever
my
son
has
a
father
yet
then
wildly
darting
round
her
eyes
in
quest
of
her
deliverers
she
exclaimed
where
where
are
those
blessed
angels
that
god
sent
to
save
my
husband
directing
her
eyes
to
jasper
and
newton
where
they
stood
like
two
youthful
samsons
in
the
full
flowing
of
their
locks
she
ran
and
fell
on
her
knees
before
them
and
seizing
their
hands
kissed
and
pressed
them
to
her
bosom
crying
out
vehemently
dear
angels
dear
angels
god
bless
you
god
almighty
bless
you
for
ever
then
instantly
for
fear
of
being
overtaken
by
the
enemy
our
heroes
snatched
the
arms
and
regimentals
of
the
slain
and
with
their
friends
and
captive
foes
recrossed
the
savannah
and
in
safety
rejoined
our
army
at
purysburgh
to
the
inexpressible
astonishment
and
joy
of
us

like
a

could
the
wishes
of

have
availed
those
gallant
soldiers
jasper
and
newton
would
long
have
lived
to
enjoy
their
past
and
to
win
fresh
laurels
but
alas
the
former
of
them
the
heroic
jasper
was
soon
led
like
a
young
lion
to
an
evil
net
the
mournful
story
of
his
death
with
heavy
heart
i
now
relate
scarcely
had
he
returned
from
georgia
laden
as
aforesaid
with
glory
when
an
express
came
into
camp
and
informed
that
the
count
was
arrived
off
tybee
instantly
we
struck
our
tents
and
marched
for
the
siege
of
savannah
on
arriving
near
that
fatal
place
we
found
that
the
french
troops
with
their
cannon
and
mortars
had
just
come
up
oh
had
we
but
advanced
at
once
to
the
attack
as
became
skilful
soldiers
we
should
have
carried
every
thing
before
us
the
frighted
garrison
would
have
hauled
down
their
colors
without
firing
a
shot
this
i
am
warranted
to
say
by
the
declaration
of
numbers
of
their
officers
who
afterwards
fell
into
our
hands
but
in
place
of
an
immediate
de
main
the
courtly
sent
a
flag
very
politely
inviting
the
town
to
do
him
the
extreme
honor
of
receiving
their
surrender
the
british
commander
was
not
much
behindhand
with
the
count
in
the
article
of
politeness
for
he
also
returned
a
flag
with
his
compliments
and
requested
to
be
permitted
four
and
twenty
hours
to
think
of
the
matter
if
the
asking
such
a
favor
was
extraordinary
what
must
the
granting
of
it
have
been
but
the
accomplished
was
fully
equal
to
such
douceurs
for
he
actually
allowed
the
enemy
four
and
twenty
hours
to
think
of
surrendering
but
instead
of
thinking
like
simpletons
they
fell
to
entrenching
like
brave
soldiers
and
being
joined
that
very
day
by
colonel
maitland
from
beaufort
with
a
regiment
of
highlanders
and
assisted
by
swarms
of
negroes
decoyed
from
their
masters
under
promise
of
freedom
they
pushed
on
their
works
with
great
rapidity
according
to
the
report
of
our
troops
who
were
encamped
nearest
to
them
nothing
was
heard
all
that
night
but
the
huzzas
of
the
soldiers
the
lashes
of
and
the
cries
of
negroes
i
never
beheld
marion
in
so
great
a
passion
i
was
actually
afraid
he
would
have
broke
out
on
general
lincoln
my
god
he
exclaimed
who
ever
heard
of
any
thing
like
this
before
first
allow
an
enemy
to
entrench
and
then
fight
him
see
the
destruction
brought
upon
the
british
at
bunker
hill
and
yet
our
troops
there
were
only
militia
raw
clodhoppers
and
not
a
mortar
nor
carronade
nor
even
a
swivel
but
only
their
ducking
guns
what
then
are
we
to
expect
from
regulars
completely
armed
with
a
choice
train
of
artillery
and
covered
by
a
for
my
own
part
when
i
look
upon
my
brave
fellows
around
me
it
wrings
me
to
the
heart
to
think
how
near
most
of
them
are
to
their
bloody
graves
in
fact
marion
was
so
outrageous
as
indeed
were
all
of
us
that
we
at
length
begged
colonel
laurens
to
speak
to
the
count
and
here
i
must
beg
the
reader
pardon
a
moment
while
i
inform
him
that
this
colonel
laurens
son
of
president
laurens
was
a
very
extraordinary
young
carolinian
on
a
trip
to
london
he
fell
in
love
with
and
married
a
celebrated
belle
of
that
city
it
would
seem
that
he
was
very
much
taken
with
his
english
relations
and
they
with
him
for
after
his
marriage
they
would
not
suffer
him
to
revisit
his
parents
who
doted
on
him
being
their
only
son
but
detained
him
with
them
in
london
as
gay
as
a
young
man
well
could
be
in
the
gayest
city
in
the
world
moving
every
day
in
the
highest
circles
of
society
and
every
night
encircled
in
the
fond
arms
of
a
beauteous
wife
but
soon
as
the
war
against
america
broke
out
his
gaiety
all
forsook
him
the
idea
of
a
ruffian
soldiery
overrunning
his
native
land
preyed
incessantly
on
his
spirits
and
threw
him
into
those
brown
studies
which
cost
his
lady
full
many
a
tear
unable
to
bear
his
disquietude
he
fled
at
length
from
his
wife
and
infant
family
to
fight
for
his
country
he
presented
himself
before
the
great
washington
who
was
so
struck
with
the
fire
that
beamed
from
his
eyes
that
he
made
him
handsome
offers
of
rank
in
the
army
but
his
favorite
service
was
to
lead
hopes
and
the
daring
bands
that
are
destined
to
carry
the
enemy
works
by
storm
washington
often
gave
him
letters
to
this
effect
to
his
generals
and
this
was
his
object
at
savannah
where
a
regiment
of
choice
infantry
was
immediately
put
under
his
command
but
instead
of
being
permitted
his
favorite
pleasure
of
seeing
his
ardent
warriors
mounting
the
enemy
works
and
rushing
down
streams
of
fire
followed
by
the
bayonet
he
was
doomed
to
fret
and
pine
in
the
humble
office
of
interpreter
between
count
and
general
lincoln
but
monsieur
le
count
said
laurens
to
the
american
officers
say
they
are
afraid
you
have
given
the
english
too
long
time
to
think
at
this
as
laurens
told
us
afterwards
the
count
put
on
a
most
comic
stare
and
breaking
into
a
hearty
laugh
replied
de
engleesh

thus
ended
the
dialogue
between
colonel
laurens
and
the
count
the
next
day
the
memorable
hours
being
expired
a
flag
was
sent
into
town
to
know
the
determination
of
the
british
officer
who
very
politely
replied
that
having
consulted
his
pillow
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
defend
the
place
a
regular
siege
was
then
commenced
and
continued
for
three
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
an
attack
was
made
and
with
the
success
which
marion
had
all
along
predicted
after
a
full
hour
exposure
to
the
destructive
rage
of
grape
shot
and
musketry
we
were
obliged
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
leaving
the
ground
covered
with
the
mingled
carcasses
of
americans
and
frenchmen
marion
corps
fighting
with
their
usual
confidence
suffered
great
loss
himself
did
not
receive
a
scratch
colonel
laurens
raged
like
a
wounded
lion
soon
as
the
retreat
was
ordered
he
paused
and
looking
round
on
his
fallen
men
cried
out
poor
fellows
i
envy
you
then
hurling
his
sword
in
wrath
against
the
ground
he
retired
presently
after
we
had
reached
our
encampment
he
came
to
my
marquee
and
like
one
greatly
disordered
said
horry
my
life
is
a
burden
to
me
i
would
to
god
i
was
lying
on
yonder
field
at
rest
with
my
poor
men
no
no
none
of
that
colonel
said
i
none
of
that
i
trust
we
shall
live
to
pay
them
yet
for
all
this
and
so
it
turned
out
and
though
for
humanity
sake
i
ought
not
to
boast
of
it
yet
we
did
live
to
pay
them
for
it
and
often
too
and
in
the
same
bloody
coin
which
they
gave
us
that
day
and
although
in
that
fiery
season
of
my
days
and
when
my
dear
country
was
in
danger
it
was
but
natural
for
me
to
rejoice
in
the
downfall
of
my
enemies
yet
i
was
often
witness
to
scenes
which
to
this
day
i
can
never
think
of
but
with
sorrow
as
when
for
example
after
dashing
upon
an
enemy
by
surprise
and
cutting
one
half
of
them
to
pieces
and
chasing
the
rest
we
returned
to
collect
the
horses
and
arms
of
the
slain
who
i
say
without
grief
could
behold
those
sad
sights
which
then
offered
themselves
of
human
beings
lying
mangled
over
the
crimson
ground
some
stone
dead
some
still
alive
and
struggling
with
brains
oozing
from
their
cloven
skulls
and
others
sitting
up
or
leaning
on
their
elbows
but
pale
with
loss
of
blood
running
in
streams
from
their
mortal
wounds
and
they
themselves
looking
down
the
while
sadly
thinking
of
home
and
of
distant
wives
and
children
whom
they
shall
never
see
again
such
thoughts
if
often
cherished
would
much
abate
the
rancor
of
malice
in
the
hearts
of
those
whose
sad
destiny
it
is
to
kill
one
another
especially
if
it
were
known
how
short
sometimes
are
the
triumphs
of
the
victor
it
was
remarkably
so
in
the
present
case
for
colonel
maitland
of
the
highlanders
who
had
contributed
a
large
part
to
this
very
unexpected
victory
was
so
elated
by
it
that
he
took
to
hard
drinking
and
killed
himself
in
a
single
week
and
the
sickly
season
coming
on
the
greater
part
of
the
garrison
perished
of
the
yellow
or
bilious
fever
thus
friends
and
foes
the
same
sad
fortune
shar
and
sickness
swallowed
whom
the
sword
had
spar
many
gallant
men
were
the
victims
of
count
folly
in
this
affair
among
the
number
was
that
impetuous
polander
the
count
polaski
but
none
fell
more
universally
lamented
than
the
heroic
jasper
every
reader
must
wish
to
hear
the
last
of
this
brave
and
generous
soldier
and
they
shall
have
it
faithfully
for
i
happened
to
be
close
by
him
when
he
received
his
death
wound
and
i
was
with
him
when
he
breathed
his
last
early
in
the
action
the
elegant
colors
presented
by
elliot
had
been
planted
on
the
enemy
works
and
the
fury
of
the
battle
raged
near
the
spot
where
they
waved
during
the
whole
of
the
bloody
fray
jasper
had
remained
unhurt
but
on
hearing
the
retreat
sounded
he
rushed
up
to
bear
off
his
colors
and
in
that
desperate
act
was
mortally
wounded
as
he
passed
by
me
with
the
colors
in
his
hands
i
observed
he
had
a
bad
limp
in
his
walk
you
are
not
much
hurt
i
hope
jasper
said
i
yes
major
he
replied
i
believe
i
have
got
my
furlough
pshaw
quoth
i
furlough
indeed
for
what
why
to
go
home
he
answered
to
go
to
heaven
i
hope
pooh
said
i
and
having
as
the
reader
must
suppose
a
good
deal
to
attend
to
i
turned
off
and
left
him
however
his
words
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
soon
as
duty
permitted
i
went
to
see
him
and
found
too
true
what
he
had
predicted
the
ball
had
opened
a
blood
vessel
in
the
lungs
which
no
art
could
stop
and
he
was
bleeding
to
slow
but
certain
death
as
i
entered
the
tent
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
me
but
their
fire
was
almost
quenched
and
stretching
his
feeble
hand
he
said
with
perfect
tranquillity
well
major
i
told
you
i
had
got
my
furlough
i
hope
not
i
replied
o
yes
said
he
i
am
going
and
very
fast
too
but
thank
god
i
am
not
afraid
to
go
i
told
him
i
knew
he
was
too
brave
to
fear
death
and
too
honest
to
be
alarmed
about
its
consequences
why
as
to
that
matter
sir
said
he
i
wo
brag
but
i
have
my
hopes
notwithstanding
i
may
be
wrong
for
i
know
i
am
but
a
poor
ignorant
body
but
somehow
or
other
i
have
always
built
my
hopes
of
what
god
may
do
for
me
hereafter
on
what
he
has
done
for
me
here
i
told
him
i
thought
he
was
very
correct
in
that
do
you
indeed
said
he
well
i
am
mighty
glad
of
that
and
now
major
here
the
way
i
always
comfort
myself
fifty
years
ago
i
say
to
myself
i
was
nothing
and
had
no
thought
that
there
was
any
such
grand
and
beautiful
world
as
this
but
still
there
was
such
a
world
notwithstanding
and
here
god
has
brought
me
into
it
now
ca
he
in
fifty
years
more
or
indeed
in
fifty
minutes
more
bring
me
into
another
world
as
much
above
this
as
this
is
above
that
state
of
nothing
wherein
i
was
fifty
years
ago
i
told
him
that
this
was
to
my
mind
a
very
happy
way
of
reasoning
and
such
no
doubt
as
suited
the
greatness
and
goodness
of
god
i
think
so
major
said
he
and
i
trust
i
shall
find
it
so
for
though
i
been
a
man
of
blood
yet
thank
god
i
always
lived
with
an
eye
to
that
great
hope
my
mother
major
was
a
good
woman
when
i
was
but
a
child
and
sat
on
her
lap
she
used
to
talk
to
me
of
god
and
tell
how
it
was
he
who
built
this
great
world
with
all
its
riches
and
good
things
and
not
for
himself
but
for
me
and
also
that
if
i
would
but
do
his
will
in
that
only
acceptable
way
a
good
life
he
would
do
still
greater
and
better
things
for
me
hereafter
well
major
from
the
mouth
of
a
dear
mother
like
her
these
things
went
so
deep
into
my
heart
that
they
could
never
be
taken
away
from
me
i
have
hardly
ever
gone
to
bed
or
got
up
again
without
saying
my
prayers
i
have
honored
my
father
and
mother
and
thank
god
been
strictly
honest
and
since
you
have
known
me
major
i
believe
you
can
bear
witness
that
though
a
strong
man
i
never
was
quarrelsome
i
told
him
nothing
afforded
me
more
satisfaction
than
to
remember
that
since
he
was
now
going
to
die
he
had
always
led
so
good
a
life
he
answered
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
he
had
a
good
hope
he
was
going
where
he
should
not
do
what
he
had
been
obliged
to
do
in
this
world
i
killed
men
in
my
time
major
but
not
in
malice
but
in
what
i
thought
a
just
war
in
defence
of
my
country
and
as
i
bore
no
malice
against
those
i
killed
neither
do
i
bear
any
against
those
who
have
killed
me
and
i
heartily
trust
in
god
for
christ
sake
that
we
shall
yet
one
day
meet
together
where
we
shall
forgive
and
love
one
another
like
brothers
i
own
indeed
major
that
had
it
so
pleased
god
i
should
have
been
glad
to
stay
a
little
longer
with
you
to
fight
for
my
country
but
however
i
humbly
hope
that
my
death
is
of
god
which
makes
it
welcome
to
me
and
so
i
bow
me
to
his
blessed
will
and
now
my
good
friend
as
i
feel
i
have
but
a
little
time
to
live
i
beg
you
will
do
a
few
things
for
me
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
i
could
not
speak
but
gathering
my
answer
from
my
tears
and
the
close
press
i
gave
his
hand
he
thus
went
on
but
it
was
in
a
low
voice
and
laborious
you
see
that
sword
it
is
the
one
which
governor
rutledge
presented
to
me
for
my
services
at
fort
moultrie
give
that
sword
to
my
father
and
tell
him
i
never
dishonored
it
if
he
should
weep
for
me
tell
him
his
son
died
in
hope
of
a
better
life
if
you
should
see
that
great
gentlewoman
elliot
tell
her
i
lost
my
life
in
saving
the
colors
she
gave
to
our
regiment
and
if
ever
you
should
come
across
poor
jones
and
his
wife
and
little
boy
tell
them
jasper
is
gone
but
that
the
remembrance
of
the
hard
battle
which
he
once
fought
for
their
sakes
brought
a
secret
joy
to
his
heart
just
as
it
was
about
to
stop
its
motion
for
ever
he
spoke
these
last
words
in
a
livelier
tone
than
usual
but
it
was
like
the
last
kindling
of
the
taper
in
its
socket
for
instantly
the
paleness
of
death
overspread
his
face
and
after
a
feeble
effort
to
vomit
with
convulsions
the
natural
effect
of
great
loss
of
blood
he
sunk
back
and
expired
from
this
victim
of
madness
i
went
with
a
heavy
heart
on
parade
to
take
a
review
of
the
sad
remains
of
the
battle
the
call
of
the
roll
completed
the
depression
of
my
spirits
to
every
fourth
or
fifth
name
there
was
no
answer
the
gloomy
silence
which
ensued
told
us
where
they
were
about
twelve
we
sent
in
a
flag
to
the
garrison
for
permission
to
bury
our
dead
curiosity
led
me
to
accompany
the
party
destined
to
this
mournful
duty
i
had
prepared
myself
for
a
sorrowful
sight
but
ah
what
words
can
express
what
i
then
saw
and
suffered
a
scattered
few
lay
here
and
there
on
the
utmost
verge
of
the
field
killed
by
cannon
shot
and
so
mangled
that
in
some
instances
it
was
hard
to
tell
who
they
were
as
we
advanced
they
lay
thicker
and
thicker
some
not
quite
dead
were
constantly
crying
water
water
oh
for
god
sake
a
little
water
others
lay
quite
dead
but
still
their
lifeless
visages
retained
the
dark
frowns
of
war
there
on
the
side
of
the
enemy
lay
the
brave
ensign
boushe
covering
with
his
dead
body
the
very
spot
where
he
had
fixed
the
american
standard
his
face
was
pale
and
cold
as
the
earth
he
pressed
but
still
it
spoke
the
fierce
determined
air
of
one
whose
last
sentiment
towards
those
degenerate
britons
was
there
d
n
you
look
at
the
stripes
of
liberty
close
by
ensign
boushe
lay
that
elegant
young
man
alexander
hume
esq
with
his
sword
still
grasped
in
his
stiffened
fingers
my
heart
bled
within
me
when
i
looked
on
young
hume
where
he
lay
in
all
the
pale
beauties
of
death
he
was
to
have
been
married
the
week
following
to
a
charming
woman
but
such
was
his
zeal
to
serve
his
country
that
he
came
a
volunteer
to
our
camp
and
met
his
death
the
next
morning
after
he
joined
us
gifted
with
a
pretty
taste
for
painting
he
had
tried
his
skill
and
very
successfully
too
in
sketching
the
likeness
of
his
lovely
mistress
for
on
opening
his
bosom
was
found
suspended
by
a
blue
ribband
the
happy
lover
color
a
fine
likeness
of
the
beautiful
miss
the
back
of
the
portrait
was
stained
with
his
blood
but
unconscious
of
her
lover
fate
she
still
wore
the
enchanting
smile
with
which
yielding
beauty
views
the
youth
she
loves
we
then
proceeded
to
bury
our
dead
which
was
done
by
digging
large
pits
sufficient
to
contain
about
a
hundred
corpses
then
taking
off
their
clothes
with
heavy
hearts
we
threw
them
into
the
pits
with
very
little
regard
to
order
and
covered
them
over
with
earth
poor
brothers
farewell
the
storm
of
your
last
battle
has
long
ago
ceased
on
the
field
and
no
trace
now
remains
on
earth
that
you
ever
lived
the
worms
have
devoured
your
flesh
and
the
mounds
raised
over
your
dust
are
sunk
back
to
the
common
level
with
the
plain
but
ah
could
your
mournful
story
be
read
the
youth
of
america
would
listen
to
the
last
words
of
washington
and
the
art
of
war
that
their
countrymen
might
no
more
be
murdered
by
military
quacks
as
a
hint
to
american
officers
i
think
it
my
duty
to
state
the
following
fact
our
fatal
attack
on
savannah
was
made
very
early
in
the
morning
a
few
hours
previous
thereto
a
council
of
war
was
held
and
while
it
was
deliberating
a
deserter
and
spy
had
the
address
to
bear
a
musket
as
sentinel
at
the
door
of
the
marquee
on
hearing
where
the
attack
was
to
be
made
he
ran
off
in
the
dark
and
gave
such
intelligence
to
the
enemy
as
enabled
them
very
completely
to
defeat
us
the
fellow
was
afterwards
taken
at
the
battle
of
hobkirk
hill
near
camden
and
hung
scarcely
had
we
finished
burying
the
dead
before
the
count
hurried
on
board
his
ships
with
his
troops
and
artillery
while
we
passing
on
in
silence
by
the
way
of
zubley
ferry
returned
to
carolina
and
pitched
our
tents
at
sheldon
the
country
seat
of
general
bull
the
theatre
of
war
being
from
this
period
and
for
some
time
at
least
removed
to
the
northern
states
the
governor
and
council
were
pleased
to
reduce
the
regiments
and
dismiss
the
supernumerary
officers
to
some
of
my
brethren
in
arms
this
was
matter
of
serious
alarm
but
for
myself
possessing
thank
god
a
liberal
fortune
in
the
country
and
feeling
no
attraction
to
the
camp
except
when
drawn
thither
by
public
danger
i
was
quite
happy
to
hear
of
this
new
arrangement
and
waited
on
his
excellency
to
return
my
commission
perhaps
some
may
say
it
was
pride
in
me
and
that
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
being
why
as
to
that
matter
it
is
not
for
me
to
boast
of
my
standing
among
my
superiors
in
those
days
but
this
i
must
needs
say
that
it
is
joy
enough
and
glory
enough
too
for
me
to
know
that
i
was
always
the
favorite
of
the
great
marion
and
that
he
seldom
ever
asked
the
lightning
of
any
other
sword
than
mine
to
lead
his
squadron
to
the
charge
however
the
moment
i
heard
as
above
that
it
was
in
agitation
to
reduce
the
regiments
i
waited
on
the
governor
and
begged
that
as
there
was
nothing
doing
he
would
allow
me
to
return
to
my
plantation
to
my
plantation
i
did
return
and
there
continued
till
spring
when
charleston
was
taken
by
the
british
at
which
time
and
for
some
weeks
before
i
was
grievously
afflicted
with
the
rheumatism
thus
by
a
providence
which
i
confess
i
did
not
at
that
time
altogether
like
i
was
kindly
saved
from
being
kidnapped
by
the
enemy
and
also
introduced
into
a
field
of
some
little
service
i
hope
to
my
country
and
of
no
great
dishonor
to
myself
however
be
this
as
it
may
the
reader
shall
soon
see
and
then
let
him
judge
for
himself
chapter
providential
escape
of
marion
out
of
charleston
the
british
fleet
and
army
invest
and
take
that
place
tarleton
and
the
british
officers
begin
to
let
out
young
scotch
macdonald
comes
upon
the
turf
extraordinary
anecdote
of
him
plays
a
very
curious
trick
on
a
rich
old
tory
how
happy
it
is
for
man
that
the
author
of
his
being
loves
him
so
much
better
than
he
loves
himself
and
has
established
so
close
a
connexion
between
his
duty
and
his
advantage
this
delightful
truth
was
remarkably
exemplified
in
an
event
that
befell
marion
about
this
time
march
dining
with
a
squad
of
choice
whigs
in
charleston
in
the
house
of
alexander
tradd
street
he
was
so
frequently
pressed
to
bumpers
of
old
wine
that
he
found
himself
in
a
fair
way
to
get
drunk
was
in
vain
he
attempted
to
beat
a
retreat
the
company
swore
that
that
would
never
do
for
general
marion
finding
at
last
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
escaping
a
debauch
but
by
leaping
out
of
one
of
the
windows
of
the
which
was
on
the
second
story
he
bravely
undertook
it
it
cost
him
however
a
broken
ankle
when
the
story
got
about
in
charleston
most
people
said
he
was
a
great
fool
for
his
pains
but
the
event
soon
proved
that
marion
was
in
the
right
and
that
there
is
no
policy
like
sticking
to
a
man
duty
for
behold
presently
charleston
was
invested
by
a
large
british
army
and
the
american
general
lincoln
finding
marion
was
utterly
unfit
for
duty
advised
him
to
push
off
in
a
litter
to
his
seat
in
john
parish
thus
providentially
was
marion
preserved
to
his
country
when
charleston
fell
as
it
soon
did
with
all
our
troops
the
spirits
of
the
british
were
so
raised
by
the
capture
of
our
metropolis
with
all
the
southern
army
that
they
presently
began
to
scour
the
neighboring
country
and
never
victors
perhaps
had
a
country
more
completely
in
their
power
their
troops
were
of
the
choicest
kind
excellently
equipped
and
commanded
by
active
ambitious
young
fellows
who
looked
on
themselves
as
on
the
high
road
to
fortune
among
the
conquered
rebels
they
all
carried
with
them
pocket
maps
of
south
carolina
on
which
they
were
constantly
poring
like
young
spendthrifts
on
their
fathers
last
testaments
they
would
also
ask
a
world
of
questions
such
as
where
lay
the
richest
lands
and
the
finest
situations
and
who
were
the
warmest
old
fellows
and
had
the
finest
girls
and
when
answered
to
their
humor
they
would
break
out
into
hearty
laughs
and
flourish
their
swords
and
and
it
away
like
young
fox
hunters
just
striking
on
a
fresh
trail
some
of
them
had
madan
famous
book
called
thylipthora
or
a
defence
of
polygamy
with
which
they
were
prodigiously
taken
and
talked
very
freely
of
reducing
the
system
to
practice
cornwallis
it
seems
was
to
be
a
bashaw
of
three
tails
rawdon
and
tarleton
of
two
each
and
as
a
natural
appendage
of
such
high
rank
they
were
to
have
their
seraglios
and
harems
filled
with
the
greatest
beauties
of
the
country
huzza
my
brave
fellows
they
would
say
to
each
other
one
more
campaign
and
the
will
be
settled
with
the
d
d
rebels
and
then
stand
by
the
girls
stand
by
the
miss
pinckneys
and
elliots
and
rutledges
and
all
your
soft
bosomed
lovely
dames
look
sharp
egad
your
charms
shall
reward
our
valor
like
the
grand
turk
we
have
regiments
of
our
own
raising
charleston
shall
be
our
constantinople
and
our
circassia
this
sweet
carolina
famed
for
beauties
prepare
the
baths
the
perfumes
and
spices
bring
forth
the
violins
and
the
rose
buds
and
tap
the
old
madeira
that
our
souls
may
all
be
joy
was
in
this
way
they
would
rant
and
then
brightened
up
to
the
pitch
they
would
look
and
grin
on
each
other
as
sweetly
as
young
foxes
who
prowling
round
a
farm
yard
had
suddenly
heard
the
cackling
of
the
rooster
pullets
the
reader
shall
presently
see
the
violent
and
bloody
course
of
these
ruffians
who
did
such
dishonor
to
the
glorious
island
they
came
from
but
before
i
begin
my
tragedy
i
beg
leave
by
way
of
prologue
to
entertain
him
a
moment
with
a
very
curious
farce
that
was
acted
on
a
wealthy
old
tory
near
monk
corner
while
colonel
tarleton
with
the
british
advance
lay
there
the
hero
of
the
play
was
a
remarkably
stout
young
scotsman
named
macdonald
son
of
the
macdonald
of
famous
defeat
at
morris
creek
bridge
north
carolina
soon
after
the
defeat
of
his
father
he
came
and
joined
our
troops
led
by
curiosity
i
could
not
help
one
day
asking
him
the
reason
to
which
he
made
in
substance
the
following
reply
immediately
on
the
misfortune
of
my
father
and
his
friends
at
the
great
bridge
i
fell
to
thinking
what
could
be
the
cause
and
then
it
struck
me
that
it
must
have
been
owing
to
their
own
monstrous
ingratitude
here
now
said
i
to
myself
is
a
parcel
of
people
meaning
my
poor
father
and
his
friends
who
fled
from
the
murderous
swords
of
the
english
after
the
massacre
at
culloden
well
they
came
to
america
with
hardly
any
thing
but
their
poverty
and
mournful
looks
but
among
this
friendly
people
that
was
enough
every
eye
that
saw
us
had
pity
and
every
hand
was
reached
out
to
assist
they
received
us
in
their
houses
as
though
we
had
been
their
own
unfortunate
brothers
they
kindled
high
their
hospitable
fires
for
us
and
spread
their
feasts
and
bid
us
eat
and
drink
and
banish
our
sorrows
for
that
we
were
in
a
land
of
friends
and
so
indeed
we
found
it
for
whenever
we
told
of
the
woeful
battle
of
culloden
and
how
the
english
gave
no
quarter
to
our
unfortunate
countrymen
but
butchered
all
they
could
overtake
these
generous
people
often
gave
us
their
tears
and
said
o
that
we
had
been
there
to
aid
with
our
rifles
then
should
many
of
these
monsters
have
bit
the
ground
they
received
us
into
the
bosoms
of
their
peaceful
forests
and
gave
us
their
lands
and
their
beauteous
daughters
in
marriage
and
we
became
rich
and
yet
after
all
soon
as
the
english
came
to
america
to
murder
this
innocent
people
merely
for
refusing
to
be
their
slaves
then
my
father
and
friends
forgetting
all
that
the
americans
had
done
for
them
went
and
joined
the
british
to
assist
them
to
cut
the
throats
of
their
friends
now
said
i
to
myself
if
ever
there
was
a
time
for
god
to
stand
up
to
punish
ingratitude
this
was
the
time
and
god
did
stand
up
for
he
enabled
the
americans
to
defeat
my
father
and
his
friends
most
completely
but
instead
of
murdering
the
prisoners
as
the
english
had
done
at
culloden
they
treated
us
with
their
usual
generosity
and
now
these
are
the
people
i
love
and
will
fight
for
as
long
as
i
live
and
so
he
did
fight
for
us
and
as
undauntedly
too
as
george
washington
ever
did
this
was
young
scotch
macdonald
now
the
curious
trick
which
he
played
is
as
follows
soon
as
he
heard
that
colonel
tarleton
was
encamped
at
monk
corner
he
went
the
next
morning
to
a
wealthy
old
tory
of
that
neighborhood
and
passing
himself
for
a
sergeant
of
colonel
tarleton
corps
presented
that
officer
compliments
adding
that
colonel
tarleton
was
just
come
to
drive
the
rebels
out
of
the
country
and
knowing
him
to
be
a
good
friend
of
the
king
begged
he
would
send
him
one
of
his
best
horses
for
a
charger
and
that
he
should
be
no
loser
by
it
send
him
one
of
my
finest
horses
cried
the
old
traitor
with
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
yes
mr
sergeant
that
i
will
by
gad
and
would
send
him
one
of
my
finest
daughters
too
had
he
but
said
the
word
a
good
friend
of
the
king
did
he
call
me
mr
sergeant
yes

save
his
sacred
majesty

good
friend
i
am
indeed
and
a
true
and

turning
to
macdonald

went
on
well

morning

may
depend
and
now

ague
mr
sergeant
and
clears
a
man
throat
of
the
cobwebs
sir
god
bless
your
honor
said
macdonald
as
he
turned
off
a
bumper
of
the
cordial
but
scarcely
had
he
smacked
his
lips
before
dick
paraded
selim
a
proud
stately
steed
that
stepped
as
though
he
disdained
the
earth
he
walked
upon
here
the
old
fellow
brightening
up
broke
out
again
aye

mr
sergeant

a
horse

my
boy

mr
sergeant
i

sir
no
damme
sir
if
there
any
work
in
all
this
country
that
good
enough
for
him
but
just
that
which
he
is
now
going
on
the
driving
the
d
d
rebels
out
of
the
land
and
in
order
to
send
selim
off
in
high
style
he
ordered
dick
to
bring
down
his
elegant
new
saddle
and
holsters
with
his
pistols
then
giving
macdonald
a
hot
breakfast
and
lending
him
his
great
coat
as
it
was
raining
he
let
him
go
with
a
promise
that
he
would
come
next
morning
and
see
how
colonel
tarleton
liked
young
selim
accordingly
next
morning
he
waited
on
colonel
tarleton
and
told
his
name
with
the
smiling
countenance
of
one
who
expected
to
be
eaten
up
with
fondness
but
alas
to
his
infinite
mortification
tarleton
heard
his
name
without
the
least
change
of
feature
after
recovering
a
little
from
his
embarrassment
he
asked
colonel
tarleton
how
he
liked
his
charger
charger
sir
replied
tarleton
yes
sir
the
elegant
horse
i
sent
you
yesterday
the
elegant
horse
you
sent
me
sir
yes
sir
and
by
your
sergeant
sir
as
he
called
himself
an
elegant
horse
and
by
my
sergeant
why
really
sir
do
understand
all
this
the
looks
and
voice
of
colonel
tarleton
too
sadly
convinced
the
old
traitor
that
he
had
been
and
that
young
selim
was
gone
then
trembling
and
pale
cried
out
why
my
dear
good
sir
did
you
not
send
a
sergeant
yesterday
with
your
compliments
to
me
and
a
request
that
i
would
send
you
my
very
best
horse
for
a
charger
which
i
did
no
sir
never
replied
tarleton
i
never
sent
a
sergeant
on
any
such
errand
nor
till
this
moment
did
i
ever
know
that
there
existed
on
earth
such
a
being
as
you
to
have
been
outwitted
in
this
manner
by
a
rebel
sergeant
to
have
lost
his
peach
brandy
his
hot
breakfast
his
great
coat
his
new
saddle
his
silver
mounted
pistols
and
worse
than
all
his
darling
horse
his
young
bounding
selim
all
these
keen
reflections
like
so
many
forked
lightnings
falling
at
once
on
the
train
and
tinder
of
his
passions
blew
them
up
to
such
a
diabolical
rage
that
the
old
sinner
had
like
to
have
been
suffocated
on
the
spot
he
turned
black
in
the
face
he
shook
throughout
and
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
breath
and
power
of
speech
he
broke
out
into
a
torrent
of
curses
enough
to
raise
the
hair
on
any
christian
man
head
nor
was
colonel
tarleton
much
behind
him
when
he
came
to
learn
what
a
noble
horse
had
slipped
through
his
hands
and
a
noble
horse
he
was
indeed
full
sixteen
hands
high
the
eye
of
a
hawk
the
spirit
of
the
king
eagle
a
chest
like
a
lion
swifter
than
a
roebuck
and
strong
as
a
buffalo
i
asked
macdonald
how
he
could
reconcile
it
to
himself
to
take
the
old
poltroon
horse
in
that
way
why
sir
replied
he
as
to
that
matter
people
will
think
differently
but
for
my
part
i
hold
that
all
is
fair
in
war
and
besides
sir
if
i
had
not
taken
him
colonel
tarleton
no
doubt
would
have
got
him
and
then
with
such
a
swift
strong
charger
as
this
he
might
do
us
as
much
harm
as
i
hope
to
do
to
them
and
he
did
do
them
harm
with
a
vengeance
for
he
had
no
more
sense
of
fear
than
a
hungry
tiger
and
as
to
his
strength
it
was
such
that
with
one
of
potter
blades
he
would
make
no
more
to
drive
through
cap
and
skull
of
a
british
dragoon
than
a
boy
would
with
a
to
chip
off
the
head
of
a
carrot
and
then
he
always
kept
selim
up
so
lustily
to
the
top
of
his
metal
he
was
so
fond
of
him
that
i
verily
believe
he
would
at
any
time
have
sold
the
shirt
off
his
back
to
get
corn
for
him
and
truly
selim
was
not
much
his
debtor
for
at
the
first
flash
and
glimpse
of
a
red
coat
he
would
paw
and
champ
his
iron
bit
with
rage
and
the
moment
he
heard
the
word
go
off
he
was
among
them
like
a
thunderbolt
and
to
see
how
macdonald
would
charge
you
would
swear
the
fear
of
death
was
never
before
his
eyes
whether
it
was
one
or
ten
against
him
it
made
no
odds
to
this
gallant
scotsman
he
never
stopped
to
count
noses
but
would
dash
in
upon
the
thickest
of
them
and
fall
to
hewing
and
cutting
down
like
a
very
fury
incarnate
poor
macdonald
the
arm
of
his
strength
is
now
in
dust
and
his
large
red
cheeks
have
long
ago
been
food
for
worms
but
never
shall
i
forget
when
first
i
saw
him
fight
was
in
the
days
when
the
british
held
georgetown
and
marion
had
said
to
me
go
and
reconnoitre
i
took
only
macdonald
with
me
before
day
we
reached
our
place
of
concealment
a
thick
clump
of
pines
near
the
road
and
in
full
view
of
the
enemy
lines
soon
as
the
bonny
morning
began
to
peep
we
heard
the
town
all
alive
as
it
were
with
drums
and
fifes
and
about
sunrise
beheld
five
dragoons
turn
out
and
with
prancing
steeds
dash
up
the
road
towards
us
i
turned
my
eye
on
macdonald
and
saw
his
face
all
kindled
up
with
the
joy
of
battle
it
was
like
that
terrible
joy
which
flashes
from
the
eyes
of
an
ambushed
lion
when
he
beholds
the
coming
forth
of
the
buffaloes
towards
his
gloomy
cave
zounds
macdonald
said
i
here
an
odds
against
us
five
to
two
by
my
soul
now
captain
he
replied
and
let
come
on
three
are
welcome
to
the
sword
of
macdonald
soon
as
they
were
come
fairly
opposite
to
us
we
gave
them
a
blast
from
our
bugles
and
with
drawn
sabres
broke
in
upon
them
like
a
tornado
their
panic
was
complete
two
we
stopped
overthrown
and
weltering
in
the
road
the
remaining
three
wheeled
about
and
taking
to
their
heels
went
off
as
if
old
nick
had
been
bringing
up
the
rear
then
you
might
have
heard
the
roar
and
seen
the
dust
which
dragoons
can
raise
when
with
whip
and
spur
and
wildly
rolling
eyes
they
bend
forward
from
the
pursuit
of
death
my
charger
being
but
a
heavy
brute
was
soon
distanced
but
they
could
not
distance
the
selim
rapid
as
the
deadly
blast
of
the
desert
he
pursued
their
dusty
course
still
gathering
upon
them
at
every
jump
and
before
they
could
reach
the
town
though
so
near
he
brought
his
furious
rider
alongside
of
two
of
them
whom
he
cut
down
one
hundred
yards
further
and
the
third
also
would
have
been
slain
for
macdonald
with
his
crimson
claymore
was
within
a
few
steps
of
him
when
the
guns
of
the
fort
compelled
him
to
retire
however
though
quickly
pursued
by
the
enemy
he
had
the
address
to
bring
off
an
elegant
horse
of
one
of
the
dragoons
whom
he
had
killed
chapter
the
abomination
and
desolation
set
up
in
south
carolina
the
author
with
sorrowful
heart

his
native
land
and
flies
to
the
north

of
warlike
friends
fortunate

with
his
gallant
friend
colonel
marion
curious
adventures
after
the
capture
of
charleston
with
all
our
troops
the
british
as
aforesaid
began
to
spread
themselves
over
the
country
then
was
exhibited
a
spectacle
which
for
sadness
and
alarm
ought
never
to
be
forgotten
by
the
people
of
america
i
mean
how
easy
a
thing
it
is
for
a
small
body
of
soldiers
to
overrun
a
populous
and
powerful
country
the
british
did
not
after
sir
henry
clinton
return
to
new
york
exceed
three
thousand
men
and
south
carolina
alone
at
the
lowest
computation
must
have
contained
fifty
thousand
and
yet
this
host
of
poor
honest
men
were
made
to
tremble
before
that
handful
of
ruffians
as
a
flock
of
sheep
before
the
wolf
or
a
household
of
little
children
before
a
dark
frowning
pedagogue
the
reason
is
immensely
plain
the
british
were
all
embodied
and
firm
as
a
rock
of
granite
the
carolinians
were
scattered
over
the
country
loose
as
a
rope
of
sand
the
british
all
well
armed
and
disciplined
moved
in
dreadful
harmony
giving
their
fire
like
a
volcano
the
carolinians
with
no
other
than
birding
pieces
and
strangers
to
the
art
of
war
were
comparatively
feeble
as
a
forest
of
the
british
though
but
units
in
number
were
so
artfully
arranged
that
they
told
for
myriads
while
for
lack
of
unity
the
carolinians
though
numerous
as
myriads
passed
only
for
ciphers
in
short
the
british
were
a
handful
of
hawks
the
poor
carolinians
a
swarm
of
and
rather
than
be
plucked
to
the
pin
feather
or
picked
to
the
bone
they
and
their
little
ones
they
were
fain
to
flatter
those
furious
falcons
and
oft
times
to
chirp
and
sing
when
they
were
much
in
the
humor
to
hate
and
curse
oh
blind
indeed
and
doubly
blind
is
that
people
and
well
worthy
of
iron
yokes
who
enjoying
all
the
sweets
of
liberty
in
a
land
of
milk
and
honey
can
expose
to
foreign
philistines
that
blessed
canaan
unguarded
by
military
science
surely
those
who
thus
throw
their
pearl
before
swine
richly
deserve
that
the
beast
should
turn
again
and
trample
them
and
their
treasures
too
into
the
mire
yes
and
had
it
not
been
for
a
better
watch
than
our
own
at
this
day
like
the
wretched
irish
we
should
have
been
trampled
into
the
mire
of
slavery
groaning
under
heavy
burdens
to
enrich
our
and
doomed
on
every
fruitless
attempt
at
freedom
to
fatten
the
buzzards
with
our
gibbeted
carcasses
for
lack
of
this
habitual
military
preparation
on
our
part
in
a
few
days
after
the
fall
of
charleston
tarleton
with
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
horse
galloped
up
to
georgetown
through
the
most
populous
part
of
the
state
with
as
much
hauteur
as
an
overseer
and
his
boys
would
gallop
through
a
negro
plantation
to
me
this
was
the
signal
for
clearing
out
accordingly
though
still
in
much
pain
from
the
rheumatism
i
mounted
my
horse
and
with
sword
and
pistol
by
my
side
set
out
for
the
northward
in
quest
of
friendly
powers
to
aid
our
fallen
cause
in
passing
through
georgetown
i
saw
a
distant
group
of
people
to
whom
i
rode
up
and
with
great
civility
as
i
thought
asked
the
news
to
which
a
young
fellow
very
scornfully
replied
that
colonel
tarleton
was
coming
and
that
the
country
thank
god
would
soon
be
cleared
of
the
continental
colonels
i
was
within
an
ace
of
drawing
a
pistol
and
shooting
the
young
slave
dead
upon
the
spot
but
god
was
pleased
to
give
me
patience
to
bear
up
under
that
heavy
cross
for
which
i
have
since
very
heartily
thanked
him
a
thousand
times
and
more
and
indeed
on
thinking
over
the
matter
it
has
often
struck
me
that
the
man
who
could
speak
in
that
way
to
one
who
had
on
as
he
saw
the
american
uniform
must
be
a
savage
and
therefore
not
an
object
of
anger
but
of
pity
but
though
my
anger
was
soon
over
nothing
could
cure
the
melancholy
into
which
this
affair
threw
me
to
see
my
native
country
thus
prostrate
under
foreign
usurpers
the
generality
quite
disheartened
and
the
few
who
dared
to
take
her
part
thus
publicly
insulted
was
a
shock
i
was
not
prepared
for
and
which
therefore
sunk
my
spirits
to
the
lowest
ebb
of
despondence
such
was
the
frame
of
mind
wherein
i
left
my
native
state
and
set
out
sick
and
alone
for
the
northward
with
scarce
a
hope
of
ever
seeing
better
days
about
the
middle
of
the
second
day
as
i
beat
my
solitary
road
slowly
winding
through
the
silent
gloomy
woods
of
north
carolina
i
discovered
just
before
me
a
stranger
and
his
servant
instantly
my
heart
sprang
afresh
for
the
pleasures
of
society
and
quickening
my
pace
i
soon
overtook
the
gentleman
when
lo
who
should
it
be
but
the
man
first
of
all
in
my
wishes
though
the
last
in
my
expectations
who
i
say
should
it
be
but
marion
our
mutual
surprise
was
great
good
heavens
we
both
exclaimed
in
the
same
moment
is
that
colonel
marion
is
that
horry
after
the
first
transports
of
that
joy
which
those
who
have
been
long
absent
from
dear
friends
can
better
conceive
than
i
describe
we
began
to
inquire
into
each
other
destinations
which
was
found
to
be
the
same
both
flying
to
the
north
for
troops
to
fight
the
british
we
had
not
rode
far
when
marion
after
looking
up
to
the
sun
who
was
now
past
his
house
came
suddenly
to
a
halt
and
said
well
come
horry
i
feel
both
peckish
and
weary
and
here
is
a
fine
shade
so
let
us
go
down
and
rest
and
refresh
ourselves
a
while
whereupon
i
dismounted
and
with
the
help
of
his
servant
for
his
ankle
was
yet
very
crazy
got
him
down
too
then
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
pine
we
talked
over
the
mournful
state
of
our
country
and
came
at
last
as
we
had
always
done
to
this
solemn
conclusion
that
we
would
stand
by
her
like
true
children
and
either
conquer
or
die
with
her
after
this
a
piece
of
dried
beef
was
paraded
from
marion
with
a
loaf
of
indian
bread
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
the
wealthy
reader
may
smile
at
this
bill
of
fare
but
to
me
it
was
a
feast
indeed
for
joy
like
a
cordial
had
so
raised
my
spirits
and
reinvigorated
my
system
that
i
fed
like
a
thresher
i
shall
never
forget
an
expression
which
marion
let
fall
during
our
repast
and
which
as
things
have
turned
out
clearly
shows
what
an
intimate
acquaintance
he
had
with
human
nature
i
happened
to
say
that
i
was
afraid
our
happy
days
were
all
gone
pshaw
horry
he
replied
do
give
way
to
such
idle
fears
our
happy
days
are
not
all
gone
on
the
contrary
the
victory
is
still
sure
the
enemy
it
is
true
have
all
the
trumps
in
their
hands
and
if
they
had
but
the
spirit
to
play
a
generous
game
would
certainly
ruin
us
but
they
have
no
idea
of
that
game
but
will
treat
the
people
cruelly
and
that
one
thing
will
ruin
them
and
save
america
i
pray
god
said
i
it
may
be
so
well
do
be
afraid
replied
he
you
will
assuredly
see
it
having
despatched
our
simple
dinner
we
mounted
again
and
pursued
our
journey
but
with
feelings
so
different
from
what
i
had
before
this
meeting
as
made
me
more
sensible
than
ever
what
a
divine
thing
friendship
is
and
well
indeed
it
was
for
us
that
our
hearts
were
so
rich
in
friendship
for
our
pockets
were
as
bare
of
gold
and
silver
as
if
there
were
no
such
metals
on
earth
and
but
for
carrying
a
knife
or
a
or
a
we
had
no
more
use
for
a
pocket
than
a
highlander
has
for
a
as
to
hard
money
we
had
not
seen
a
dollar
for
years
and
of
old
continental
bad
as
it
was
we
had
received
but
little
and
that
little
was
gone
away
like
a
flash
as
the
reader
may
well
suppose
when
he
comes
to
learn
that
a
bottle
of
rum
would
sweep
fifty
dollars
and
so
here
were
two
continental
colonels
of
us
just
started
on
a
journey
of
several
hundred
miles
without
a
cent
in
pocket
but
though
poor
in
gold
we
were
rich
in
faith
burning
patriots
ourselves
we
had
counted
on
it
as
a
certainty
that
every
body
we
met
out
of
reach
of
the
british
were
as
fiery
as
we
and
that
the
first
sight
of
our
uniforms
would
command
smiling
countenances
and
hot
suppers
and
downy
beds
and
mint
slings
and
in
short
everything
that
our
hearts
could
wish
but
alas
and
alack
the
mistake
for
instead
of
being
smiled
on
every
where
along
the
road
as
the
champions
of
liberty
we
were
often
grinned
at
as
if
we
had
been
horse
thieves
in
place
of
being
hailed
with
benedictions
we
were
frequently
in
danger
from
the
brick
bats
and
in
lieu
of
hot
dinners
and
suppers
we
were
actually
on
the
point
of
starving
both
we
and
our
horses
for
in
consequence
of
candidly
telling
the
publicans
that
we
had
nothing
to
pay
they
as
candidly
declared
they
had
nothing
to
give
and
that
those
that
had
no
money
had
no
business
to
travel
at
length
we
came
to
the
resolution
to
say
nothing
about
our
poverty
but
after
getting
such
things
as
we
wanted
to
give
our
bills
in
this
we
felt
ourselves
perfectly
warranted
for
we
had
both
of
us
thank
god
very
sufficient
estates
and
besides
turning
out
as
we
did
to
fight
for
our
country
we
thought
we
had
even
by
sacred
precept
a
very
fair
claim
on
that
country
for
a
little
food
i
remember
one
evening
after
dark
we
reached
a
tavern
the
owner
of
which
at
first
seemed
very
fond
of
accommodating
us
but
as
soon
as
a
lighted
wood
torch
had
given
him
a
glimpse
of
our
regimentals
the
rogue
began
to
hem
and
ha
to
tell
us
of
a
fine
about
five
miles
further
on
we
begged
him
to
recollect
that
it
was
night
and
also
very
rainy
and
as
dark
as
pitch
oh
quoth
he
the
road
is
mighty
plain
you
ca
miss
your
way
but
consider
sir
we
are
strangers
oh
i
never
liked
strangers
in
all
my
life
but
sir
we
are
your
countrymen
american
officers
going
to
the
north
for
men
to
fight
your
battles
oh
i
wants
nobody
to
fight
my
battles
king
george
is
good
enough
for
me
but
sir
we
have
travelled
all
day
long
without
a
mouthful
for
ourselves
or
horses
to
this
also
the
brute
was
preparing
some
fit
answer
when
his
wife
who
appeared
to
be
a
very
genteel
woman
with
a
couple
of
charming
girls
her
daughters
ran
out
and
declared
that
take
us
in
he
could
and
should
that
he
should
and
that
he
might
as
well
consent
at
first
for
they
would
not
be
said
nay
even
against
all
this
he
stood
out
for
some
time
till
at
length
his
wife
reminded
him
that
though
the
british
were
carrying
every
thing
before
them
in
south
carolina
yet
that
washington
was
still
in
the
field
and
the
issue
of
the
war
unknown
and
that
at
any
rate
it
was
good
to
have
a
friend
at
court
on
this
he
came
to
a
pause
and
at
length
reluctantly
drawled
out
well
i
suppose
you
must
come
in
i
have
related
this
story
partly
to
show
what
a
savage
man
would
be
without
that
softening
polishing
friend
a
good
wife
observing
that
we
were
wet
and
cold
this
amiable
woman
and
her
daughters
soon
had
kindled
up
for
us
a
fine
sparkling
fire
to
which
their
own
sweetly
smiling
looks
gave
tenfold
cheerfulness
and
comfort
and
while
the
husband
went
poking
about
the
house
silent
and
surly
as
an
slave
the
ladies
displayed
towards
us
the
most
endearing
attentions
the
mother
brought
out
from
her
closet
a
bottle
of
nice
family
cordial
to
warm
and
cheer
us
while
the
girls
presented
basins
of
water
and
towels
that
we
might
wash
and
refresh
ourselves
after
our
fatigue
and
all
these
seasonable
hospitalities
they
did
not
with
that
ungracious
silence
and
reserve
which
so
often
depress
the
traveller
spirits
but
with
the
charming
alacrity
of
daughters
or
sisters
so
sweetening
every
thing
with
smiles
and
sprightly
chat
as
almost
made
us
feel
ourselves
at
home
as
with
deep
struck
thought
i
compared
our
present
happy
condition
with
that
a
few
minutes
before
benighted
wet
and
weary
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
o
my
god
what
pity
it
is
that
among
so
many
labors
which
poor
mortals
take
under
the
sun
they
do
not
labor
more
for
that
which
alone
deserves
their
care
i
mean
that
love
which
at
once
diffuses
and
enjoys
all
the
happiness
both
of
earth
and
heaven
at
supper
the
poor
creature
of
a
husband
strove
very
hard
to
draw
marion
into
a
dispute
about
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
our
rebellion
i
expected
to
have
heard
him
lashed
very
severely
for
such
brutality
for
few
men
ever
excelled
marion
in
the
abrupt
but
every
time
the
subject
was
introduced
he
contrived
very
handsomely
to
waive
it
by
some
pretty
turn
to
the
ladies
which
happily
relieved
their
terrors
and
gave
a
fresh
spring
to
general
and
sprightly
conversation
as
our
excellent
hostess
and
her
fair
daughters
were
about
to
retire
we
bade
them
good
night
and
also
adieu
telling
them
that
we
meant
to
ride
very
early
in
the
morning
to
this
they
stoutly
objected
urging
that
from
our
fatigue
and
fasting
we
ought
to
pass
a
day
or
two
with
them
and
refresh
ourselves
but
if
we
could
not
do
this
we
must
at
any
rate
stay
and
give
them
the
pleasure
of
our
company
at
breakfast
when
we
retired
to
our
chamber
i
asked
marion
why
he
had
not
given
that
brute
our
landlord
a
proper
set
down
i
am
surprised
at
you
horry
he
replied
when
you
see
that
your
fellow
man
is
wretched
ca
you
give
him
quarter
you
must
have
observed
ever
since
we
darkened
his
door
that
with
spleen
and
toryism
this
poor
gentleman
is
in
the
condition
of
him
in
the
parable
who
was
possessed
of
seven
devils
since
we
have
not
the
power
to
cast
them
out
let
us
not
torment
him
before
his
time
besides
this
excellent
woman
his
wife
these
charming
girls
his
daughters
they
love
him
no
doubt
and
therefore
to
us
at
least
he
ought
to
be
sacred
because
surrounded
by
their
affections
the
next
morning
while
breakfast
was
preparing
the
churl
renewed
his
hostilities
by
telling
us
with
a
malignant
pleasure
in
his
face
that
he
and
his
neighbors
were
making
ready
to
go
to
south
carolina
for
negroes
for
negroes
replied
marion
pray
sir
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
sir
returned
he
south
carolina
is
now
all
one
as
conquered
by
the
british
and
why
may
we
not
go
and
pick
up
what
negroes
we
can
they
would
help
me
in
my
yonder
marion
asked
him
whether
if
he
were
to
find
his
negroes
he
would
think
it
right
to
take
them
to
be
sure
i
would
answered
he
you
great
men
who
choose
to
fight
against
your
king
are
all
now
running
away
and
why
may
i
not
go
and
catch
your
negroes
as
well
as
any
body
else
my
god
replied
marion
with
a
deep
sigh
what
will
this
world
come
to
and
turned
the
conversation
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
we
took
leave
of
this
most
unequally
yoked
couple
and
their
lovely
daughters
and
continued
our
journey
we
had
not
got
far
from
the
house
when
marion
servant
rode
up
and
with
a
very
smirking
face
told
his
master
that
he
believed
the
gentlewoman
where
we
stayed
last
night
must
be
a
monstrous
fine
lady
marion
asked
him
why
he
thought
so
why
sir
replied
he
she
not
only
made
me
almost
burst
myself
with
eating
and
drinking
and
all
of
the
very
best
but
she
has
gone
and
filled
my
portmanteau
too
filled
it
up
chock
full
sir
a
fine
ham
of
bacon
sir
and
a
pair
of
roasted
fowls
with
two
bottles
of
brandy
and
a
matter
of
a
peck
of
biscuit
god
bless
the
dear
lady
we
both
exclaimed
at
the
same
moment
and
i
trust
god
did
bless
her
for
indeed
to
us
she
was
a
kind
angel
who
not
only
refreshed
our
bodies
but
still
more
feasted
our
souls
and
though
eight
and
twenty
long
years
have
rolled
away
since
that
time
i
can
still
see
that
angel
smile
which
brightened
on
her
face
towards
us
and
the
memory
of
which
springs
a
joy
in
my
heart
beyond
what
the
memory
of
his
money
bags
ever
gave
to
the
miser
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
that
we
left
this
charming
family
i
mean
the
fairer
part
of
it
we
reached
the
house
of
colonel
thatcher
one
of
the
noblest
whigs
in
north
carolina
his
eyes
seemed
as
though
they
would
never
tire
in
gazing
on
our
regimentals
we
soon
gave
him
the
history
of
our
travels
through
his
native
state
and
of
the
very
uncivil
manner
in
which
his
countrymen
had
treated
us
he
smiled
and
bid
us
be
thankful
for
that
it
was
entirely
of
god
mercy
that
we
had
come
off
so
well
those
people
continued
he
are
mere
hottentots
a
set
of
unenlightened
miserable
tories
who
know
nothing
of
the
grounds
of
the
war
nothing
of
the
rights
and
blessings
we
are
contending
for
nor
of
the
corruptions
and
cruelties
of
the
british
ministry
and
are
therefore
just
as
ready
to
fall
into
their
destructive
jaws
as
young
are
to
run
into
the
mouth
of
a
chapter
glorious
news
a
brave
army
of
continentals
coming
up
marion
and
the
author
hasten
to
meet
them
at
roanoke
fortunately
get
introduced
to
the
baron
de
kalb
polite
reception
by
that
amiable
officer
curious
and
interesting
conversation
after
spending
two
days
of
very
welcome
repose
with
the
elegant
colonel
thatcher
we
took
leave
and
set
out
for
hillsborough
where
we
met
general
huger
and
colonel
white
of
the
horse
who
told
us
the
glorious
news
that
washington
had
sent
on
a
gallant
detachment
of
continentals
who
were
now
in
full
march
to
aid
south
carolina
our
hearts
leaped
for
joy
at
the
news
so
great
was
our
impatience
to
see
what
our
hearts
had
so
long
and
so
fondly
dwelt
on
an
army
of
friends
that
we
could
not
wait
until
they
came
up
but
hurried
off
instantly
to
meet
them
at
roanoke
where
it
was
said
they
were
crossing
on
reaching
the
river
we
found
that
they
had
all
got
over
and
had
just
formed
their
line
of
march
oh
how
lovely
is
the
sight
of
friends
in
the
day
of
our
danger
we
have
had
many
military
corps
but
none
had
ever
interested
us
like
this
in
shining
regimentals
and
glittering
arms
they
moved
before
the
eye
of
the
glowing
fancy
like
a
host
of
heroes
thrice
happy
for
man
that
a
veil
dark
as
the
grave
is
thrown
over
future
events
for
how
could
we
who
had
seen
one
fine
army
butchered
at
savannah
and
another
captured
at
charleston
have
borne
up
under
the
dreadful
prospect
of
having
this
gallant
armament
also
destroyed
in
a
few
days
soon
as
our
first
paroxysm
of
joy
had
a
little
subsided
we
moved
toward
head
quarters
where
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
fall
in
with
our
old
friend
semp
who
appeared
overjoyed
to
see
us
and
immediately
offered
to
introduce
us
to
the
general
his
excellency
horatio
gates
was
the
commander
in
chief
but
as
he
had
not
yet
arrived
the
command
rested
on
that
brave
old
german
general
the
baron
de
kalb
it
was
to
this
officer
that
colonel
semp
introduced
us
and
as
was
usual
with
him
in
very
flattering
terms
styling
us
continental
colonels
and
two
of
the
wealthiest
and
most
distinguished
patriots
of
south
carolina
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
felt
when
introduced
to
this
gentleman
he
appeared
to
be
rather
elderly
but
though
the
snow
of
winter
was
on
his
locks
his
cheeks
were
still
reddened
over
with
the
bloom
of
spring
his
person
was
large
and
manly
above
the
common
size
with
great
nerve
and
activity
while
his
fine
blue
eyes
expressed
the
mild
radiance
of
intelligence
and
goodness
he
received
us
very
politely
saying
he
was
glad
to
see
us
especially
as
we
were
the
first
carolinians
that
he
had
seen
which
had
not
a
little
surprised
him
observing
i
suppose
that
we
labored
under
rather
too
much
of
our
national
weakness
i
mean
modesty
he
kindly
redoubled
his
attentions
to
us
and
soon
succeeded
in
curing
us
of
our
reserve
i
thought
said
he
that
british
tyranny
would
have
sent
great
numbers
of
the
south
carolinians
to
join
our
arms
but
so
far
from
it
they
are
all
as
we
have
been
told
running
to
take
british
protections
surely
they
are
not
tired
already
of
fighting
for
liberty
we
told
him
the
reason
was
very
plain
to
us
who
were
inhabitants
of
that
country
and
knew
very
well
the
state
of
things
there
aye
replied
he
well
what
can
the
reason
be
why
sir
answered
marion
the
people
of
carolina
form
but
two
classes
the
rich
and
the
poor
the
poor
are
generally
very
poor
because
not
being
necessary
to
the
rich
who
have
slaves
to
do
all
their
work
they
get
no
employment
from
them
being
thus
unsupported
by
the
rich
they
continue
poor
and
low
spirited
they
seldom
get
money
and
indeed
what
little
they
do
get
is
laid
out
in
brandy
to
raise
their
spirits
and
not
on
books
and
newspapers
to
get
information
hence
they
know
nothing
of
the
comparative
blessings
of
their
own
country
nor
of
the
great
dangers
which
threaten
it
and
therefore
care
nothing
about
it
as
to
the
other
class
the
rich
they
are
generally
very
rich
and
consequently
afraid
to
stir
unless
a
fair
chance
offer
lest
the
british
should
burn
their
houses
and
furniture
and
carry
off
their
negroes
and
stock
but
permit
me
to
assure
you
sir
that
though
thus
kept
under
by
fear
they
still
mortally
hate
the
british
and
will
i
am
confident
the
moment
they
see
an
army
of
friends
at
their
door
fly
to
their
standard
like
a
generous
pack
to
the
sound
of
the
horn
that
calls
them
to
the
chase
of
a
hated
wolf
the
baron
de
kalb
smiled
and
said
he
hoped
it
would
be
found
so
no
doubt
of
it
at
all
sir
replied
marion
the
baron
then
invited
us
to
dine
with
him
but
added
smiling
that
he
hoped
we
had
good
military
stomachs
that
could
relish
and
digest
plain
fare
which
was
all
he
could
promise
us
and
perhaps
hardly
enough
of
that
on
sitting
down
to
table
we
found
that
his
prediction
about
the
bill
of
fare
was
most
unwelcomely
true
our
dinner
was
just
half
a
side
of
a
miserably
poor
hog
as
miserably
cooked
and
in
such
small
quantity
that
before
we
were
done
there
was
nothing
of
it
left
but
a
rasher
for
good
manners
sake
and
as
to
bread
there
was
not
even
a
it
is
true
that
by
way
of
substitute
we
had
a
trencher
or
two
of
sweet
potatoes
paraded
our
drink
was
admirably
suited
to
the
dinner
apple
brandy
with
river
water
god
forbid
that
i
should
be
unmindful
of
his
favors
for
well
do
i
know
that
the
least
of
them
is
much
better
than
the
best
of
us
deserve
on
the
contrary
i
mention
it
rather
as
a
compliment
to
his
heavenly
bounty
which
is
wont
to
spread
our
tables
with
so
many
dainties
as
to
cause
even
roast
pigs
and
sweet
potatoes
to
pass
for
a
sorry
meal
soon
as
dinner
was
over
all
of
us
who
could
parade
a
cigar
or
a
pipe
began
to
comfort
our
olfactories
with
a
puff
not
forgetting
our
brandy
the
while
so
that
by
the
time
we
had
got
well
entrenched
in
clouds
of
fragrant
we
were
in
admirable
cue
for
a
dish
of
chat
de
kalb
led
the
way
and
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
in
the
following
words
colonel
marion
said
he
pressing
the
tobacco
in
his
pipe
at
the
same
time
can
you
answer
me
one
question
most
gladly
general
and
a
thousand
if
i
can
thank
you
colonel
but
one
will
do
be
pleased
then
sir
to
say
on
well
colonel
can
you
tell
me
how
old
i
am
that
a
tough
question
general
tough
colonel
pray
how
do
you
make
that
out
why
sir
there
is
a
strange
january
and
may
sort
of
contrast
between
your
locks
and
your
looks
that
quite
confuses
me
by
your
locks
you
seem
to
be
in
the
winter
by
your
looks
in
the
summer
of
your
days
well
but
colonel
striking
the
balance
between
the
two
whereabouts
do
you
take
me
to
be
why
sir
in
the
spring
and
prime
of
life
about
forty
good
heavens
forty
yes
sir
that
the
mark
there
or
thereabouts
what
no
more
no
sir
not
a
day
more
not
an
hour
upon
honor
yes
sir
upon
honor
upon
a
soldier
honor
ha
ha
ha
well
colonel
i
would
not
for
a
thousand
guineas
that
your
riflemen
shot
as
wide
off
the
mark
as
you
guess
the
british
would
not
dread
them
as
they
do
forty
years
old
indeed
why
what
will
you
say
colonel
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
been
two
and
forty
years
a
soldier
here
we
all
exclaimed
impossible
general
impossible
i
ask
your
pardon
gentlemen
replied
he
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
but
very
certain
very
certain
that
i
have
been
two
and
forty
years
a
soldier
in
the
service
of
the
king
of
france
o
wonderful
two
and
forty
years
well
then
at
that
rate
and
pray
how
old
general
may
you
take
yourself
to
be
why
gentlemen
replied
he
man
and
boy
i
am
now
about
good
heaven
and
yet
such
bloom
such
flesh
and
blood
if
you
are
so
surprised
gentlemen
at
my
looks
at
what
would
you
have
thought
had
you
seen
my
father
at
your
father
general
he
can
not
be
alive
yet
sure
alive
yes
thank
god
and
alive
like
to
be
i
hope
for
many
a
good
year
to
come
yet
now
gentlemen
let
me
tell
you
a
little
story
of
my
father
the
very
christmas
before
i
sailed
for
america
i
went
to
see
him
it
was
three
hundred
miles
at
least
from
paris
on
arriving
at
the
house
i
found
my
dear
old
mother
at
her
wheel
in
her
year
mind
gentlemen
spinning
very
gaily
while
one
of
her
carded
the
wool
and
sung
a
hymn
for
her
soon
as
the
first
transport
of
meeting
was
over
i
eagerly
asked
for
my
father
not
be
uneasy
my
son
said
she
father
is
only
gone
to
the
woods
with
his
three
little
to
cut
some
fuel
for
the
fire
and
they
will
all
be
here
presently
i
be
bound
and
so
it
proved
for
in
a
very
short
time
i
heard
them
coming
along
my
father
was
the
foremost
with
his
axe
under
his
arm
and
a
stout
billet
on
his
shoulder
and
the
children
each
with
his
little
load
staggering
along
and
prattling
to
my
father
with
all
their
might
be
assured
gentlemen
that
this
was
a
most
delicious
moment
to
me
thus
after
a
long
absence
to
meet
a
beloved
father
not
only
alive
but
in
health
and
dear
domestic
happiness
above
the
lot
of
kings
also
to
see
the
two
extremes
of
human
life
youth
and
age
thus
sweetly
meeting
and
mingling
in
that
cordial
love
which
turns
the
cottage
into
a
paradise
in
telling
this
little
story
of
his
aged
father
and
his
young
relatives
the
general
fine
countenance
caught
an
animation
which
perfectly
charmed
us
all
the
eyes
of
marion
sparkled
with
pleasure
general
said
he
the
picture
which
you
have
given
us
of
your
father
and
his
little
though
short
is
extremely
interesting
and
delightful
it
confirms
me
in
an
opinion
which
i
have
long
entertained
which
is
that
there
is
more
happiness
in
low
life
than
in
high
life
in
a
cottage
than
in
a
castle
pray
give
us
general
your
opinion
of
that
matter
why
replied
de
kalb
this
opinion
of
yours
colonel
is
not
a
novel
one
by
any
means
it
was
the
opinion
of
rousseau
fenelon
and
of
many
other
great
men
and
elegant
writers
but
notwithstanding
such
high
authority
i
must
still
beg
leave
to
be
a
dissenter
i
have
seen
so
many
people
happy
and
also
unhappy
both
in
cottages
and
castles
that
i
can
not
but
conclude
that
happiness
does
not
belong
peculiarly
to
either
condition
but
depends
on
something
very
different
from
and
infinitely
superior
to
both
we
eagerly
asked
what
he
alluded
to
why
gentlemen
replied
he
since
you
have
been
so
polite
as
to
ask
my
opinion
i
will
as
frankly
give
it
though
i
am
afraid
it
will
seem
very
odd
especially
coming
from
a
soldier
however
be
that
as
it
may
my
opinion
you
have
asked
and
my
opinion
you
shall
have
which
is
that
religion
is
the
only
thing
to
make
a
man
happy
in
cottages
or
courts
the
young
officers
began
to
stare
gathering
from
their
looks
that
some
of
the
company
did
not
relish
this
kind
of
philosophy
he
quickly
thus
resumed
his
speech
pardon
gentlemen
i
beg
pardon
i
must
not
be
misunderstood
by
i
do
mean
i
do
mean
that
superstitious
grimace
that
rolling
up
of
white
eyes
and
spreading
of
sanctified
palms
with
faces
and
long
prayers
and
all
the
rest
of
that
holy
trumpery
which
so
far
from
making
people
cheerful
tends
but
to
throw
them
into
the
dumps
but
i
mean
by
that
divine
effort
of
the
soul
which
rises
and
embraces
the
great
author
of
its
being
with
filial
ardor
and
walks
and
converses
with
him
as
a
dutiful
child
with
his
revered
father
now
gentlemen
i
would
ask
all
prejudice
apart
what
is
there
can
so
exalt
the
mind
and
gladden
the
heart
as
this
high
friendship
with
heaven
and
those
immortal
hopes
that
spring
from
religion
here
one
of
the
company
half
blushing
as
palpably
convicted
by
the
truth
of
the
general
argument
smartly
called
out
well
but
general
do
you
think
we
can
do
pretty
well
here
in
camp
without
religion
what
replied
de
kalb
would
you
give
it
all
up
to
the
priests
yes
to
be
sure
i
would
said
the
young
officer
for
i
am
for
every
following
his
own
trade
general
they
are
priests
and
we
are
soldiers
so
let
them
do
all
the
praying
and
we
will
do
all
the
fighting
why
as
to
the
fighting
part
rejoined
de
kalb
i
have
no
objection
to
doing
all
that
for
the
priests
especially
as
their
profession
does
not
allow
them
to
fight
for
themselves
but
as
to
giving
them
up
all
the
devotion
i
confess
i
am
not
so
liberal
no
no
gentlemen
charity
begins
at
home
and
i
am
not
for
parting
with
pleasure
so
easily
pleasure
replied
the
young
officer
with
a
sneer
yes
sir
pleasure
returned
de
kalb
according
to
my
creed
sir
piety
and
pleasure
are
synonymous
terms
and
i
should
just
as
soon
think
of
living
physically
without
bread
as
of
living
pleasantly
without
religion
for
what
is
religion
as
i
said
before
but
habitual
friendship
with
god
and
what
can
the
heart
conceive
so
delightful
or
what
can
so
gratify
it
in
all
its
best
and
strongest
desires
for
example
gentlemen
we
are
all
fond
of
honor
i
for
my
part
am
fond
of
the
friendship
of
the
king
of
france
you
glory
in
the
friendship
of
the
great
washington
then
what
must
be
the
glory
of
him
who
is
in
friendship
with
god
again
gentlemen
we
are
all
born
to
love
to
admire
to
adore
if
a
man
have
no
love
he
is
gloomy
if
he
love
a
worthless
object
he
is
mortified
but
if
he
love
a
truly
worthy
object
his
face
shines
his
eyes
sparkle
his
voice
becomes
sweet
and
his
whole
air
expressive
of
cheerfulness
and
as
this
happy
feeling
must
in
the
nature
of
things
keep
pace
with
the
excellence
of
the
object
that
is
beloved
then
what
must
be
the
cheerfulness
of
him
who
loves
the
greatest
best
and
loveliest
of
all
beings
whose
eternal
perfections
and
goodness
can
for
ever
make
him
happier
than
heart
can
ask
or
think
in
a
word
gentlemen
though
i
am
a
soldier
and
soldiers
you
know
are
seldom
enthusiasts
in
this
way
yet
i
verily
believe
as
i
said
before
that
a
man
of
enlightened
and
fervent
piety
must
be
infinitely
happier
in
a
cottage
than
an
irreligious
emperor
in
his
palace
in
the
height
of
this
extraordinary
conversation
an
officer
stepped
in
and
announced
the
arrival
of
general
gates
and
here
as
i
have
in
this
chapter
given
the
reader
what
the
jockies
call
a
long
heat
i
beg
leave
to
order
a
halt
and
allow
him
a
little
time
to
breathe
chapter
gates
bon
mot
of
british
general
lee
how
an
army
ought
not
to
march
de
kalb
prophecies
chickens
counted
before
they
are
hatched
alias
marion
and
the
author
sent
by
gates
to
prevent
the
escape
of
cornwallis
before
he
had
run
the
british
and
american
armies
meet
gates
and
his
leave
de
kalb
in
the
lurch
his
gallant
behavior
and
glorious
death
when
a
poor
fellow
is
going
down
hill
it
is
but
too
common
they
say
for
every
body
to
give
him
a
kick
let
dogs
delight
to
bark
and
bite
for
heaven
hath
made
them
so
but
if
i
know
myself
aright
i
can
truly
say
that
nothing
of
this
vile
spirit
suggests
a
syllable
of
what
i
now
write
of
the
unfortunate
general
gates
on
the
contrary
i
feel
an
ardent
wish
to
speak
handsomely
of
him
and
in
one
view
of
him
i
can
so
speak
as
a
gentleman
few
camps
or
courts
ever
produced
his
superior
but
though
a
perfect
chesterfield
at
court
in
camp
he
was
certainly
but
a
paris
is
true
at
saratoga
he
got
his
temples
stuck
round
with
laurels
as
thick
as
a
queen
with
gaudy
flowers
and
though
the
greater
part
of
this
was
certainly
the
gallant
workmanship
of
arnold
and
morgan
yet
did
it
so
hoist
general
gates
in
the
opinion
of
the
nation
that
many
of
his
dear
friends
with
a
prudent
regard
no
doubt
to
their
own
dearer
selves
had
the
courage
to
bring
him
forward
on
the
military
turf
and
run
him
for
the
generalissimoship
against
the
great
washington
but
though
they
were
not
able
to
prosper
him
in
this
mad
attempt
yet
they
so
far
succeeded
as
to
get
him
the
command
of
the
army
of
carolina
where
his
short
and
calamitous
career
soon
caused
every
good
patriot
to
thank
god
for
continuing
to
his
servant
washington
the
command
of
the
american
armies
on
his
way
from
the
northern
states
general
gates
passed
through
fredericksburg
where
he
fell
in
with
general
charles
lee
who
in
his
frank
manner
asked
him
where
he
was
going
why
to
take
cornwallis
i
am
afraid
quoth
lee
you
will
find
him
a
tough
piece
of
english
beef
tough
sir
replied
gates
tough
then
begad
i
tender
him
i
make
of
him
sir
in
three
hours
after
i
set
eyes
upon
him
aye
will
you
indeed
returned
lee
well
then
send
for
me
and
i
will
go
and
help
you
to
eat
him
gates
smiled
and
bidding
him
adieu
rode
off
lee
bawled
after
him
take
care
gates
take
care
or
your
northern
laurels
will
degenerate
into
southern
willows
the
truth
is
though
general
lee
was
extremely
splenetic
other
than
which
such
a
miserable
old
bachelor
and
infidel
could
hardly
be
yet
he
certainly
had
a
knack
of
telling
people
fortunes
by
virtue
of
this
faculty
he
presently
discovered
that
general
gates
was
no
fabius
but
on
the
contrary
too
much
inclined
to
the
fatal
rashness
of
his
unfortunate
colleague
and
so
it
turned
out
for
from
the
moment
he
joined
the
army
he
appeared
to
act
like
one
who
thought
of
nothing
but
to
have
it
proclaimed
of
him
in
all
the
newspapers
on
the
continent
that
in
so
many
days
hours
minutes
and
seconds
he
flew
from
philadelphia
to
south
carolina
fought
and
conquered
cornwallis
and
flew
back
again
with
the
trophies
of
a
second
british
army
vanquished
instead
of
moving
on
as
old
de
kalb
had
done
with
a
prudent
regard
to
the
health
and
refreshment
of
the
troops
he
jehu
like
drove
them
on
without
regard
to
either
he
would
not
take
the
lower
road
as
de
kalb
earnestly
advised
through
a
rich
and
plentiful
country
oh
no
that
was
too
round
about
would
too
long
have
delayed
his
promised
glory
like
an
eagle
shaking
his
bold
pinions
in
the
clouds
of
his
pride
he
must
dash
down
at
once
upon
his
prey
and
so
for
a
near
cut
take
us
through
a
pine
barren
sufficient
to
have
starved
a
forlorn
hope
of
caterpillars
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
describe
the
sufferings
of
the
army
for
admitting
that
i
should
not
lack
words
my
reader
would
i
am
sure
lack
faith
indeed
at
this
season
when
the
old
crop
was
gone
and
the
new
not
quite
come
in
what
had
we
to
expect
especially
in
such
a
miserable
country
where
many
a
family
goes
without
dinner
unless
the
father
can
knock
down
a
squirrel
in
the
woods
or
his
pale
sickly
boy
pick
up
a
terrapin
in
the
swamps
we
did
indeed
sometimes
fall
in
with
a
little
corn
but
then
the
poor
skinny
women
with
long
uncombed
tresses
and
shrivelled
breasts
hanging
down
would
run
screaming
to
us
with
tears
in
their
eyes
declaring
that
if
we
took
away
their
corn
they
and
their
children
must
perish
such
times
i
never
saw
and
i
pray
god
i
may
never
see
nor
hear
of
again
for
to
this
day
the
bare
thought
of
it
depresses
my
spirits
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
think
of
it
and
often
too
that
i
may
be
the
more
thankful
to
him
who
never
but
in
that
one
instance
permitted
me
to
suffer
except
in
thinking
of
it
there
was
one
case
in
particular
which
i
shall
never
forget
almost
spent
with
fatigue
and
fasting
we
halted
one
evening
near
the
house
of
a
man
whose
plantation
bespoke
him
a
tolerably
good
liver
he
met
us
with
a
countenance
strongly
marked
with
terror
and
begged
for
god
sake
we
would
not
ruin
him
for
that
he
had
a
large
family
of
children
to
maintain
we
told
him
that
we
were
soldiers
fighting
for
the
country
and
that
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
starve
understanding
from
this
that
we
meant
to
forage
upon
him
that
night
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
turning
about
went
off
without
saying
another
word
i
must
confess
i
could
not
help
feeling
very
sensibly
for
him
especially
when
we
saw
his
little
children
in
melancholy
groups
peeping
at
us
around
the
corners
of
the
house
his
young
corn
which
seemed
to
cover
about
fifty
acres
was
just
in
the
prime
roasting
ear
state
and
he
had
also
a
couple
of
beautiful
orchards
of
peach
and
apple
trees
loaded
with
young
fruit
scarcely
were
our
tents
pitched
before
the
whole
army
foot
and
horse
turned
in
to
destroy
the
trees
were
all
threshed
in
a
trice
after
which
the
soldiers
fell
like
a
herd
of
wild
boars
upon
the
roasting
ears
and
the
horses
upon
the
blades
and
stalks
so
that
by
morning
light
there
was
no
sign
or
symptom
left
that
corn
had
ever
grown
there
since
the
creation
of
the
world
what
became
of
the
poor
man
and
his
children
god
only
knows
for
by
sunrise
we
were
all
under
marching
orders
again
bending
for
the
south
i
said
all
but
i
only
meant
all
that
were
able
for
numbers
were
knocked
up
every
night
by
agues
fluxes
and
other
maladies
brought
on
by
excessive
fatigue
and
lack
of
food
i
once
before
observed
how
highly
the
baron
de
kalb
had
been
pleased
to
think
of
marion
and
myself
travelling
so
far
to
meet
him
his
liking
for
us
grew
so
fast
that
we
had
not
been
with
him
more
than
two
days
before
he
appointed
us
his
supernumerary
aids
we
were
of
course
much
in
his
company
and
entrusted
i
believe
with
every
thought
of
his
bosom
that
related
to
the
good
of
the
army
he
made
no
scruple
to
tell
us
how
utterly
unmilitary
those
proceedings
were
and
frequently
foretold
the
ruin
that
would
ensue
here
said
he
we
are
hurrying
to
attack
an
enemy
who
if
they
but
knew
our
condition
would
long
for
nothing
so
much
as
our
arrival
we
at
least
raw
militia
they
all
regulars
we
fatigued
they
fresh
we
feeble
and
faint
through
long
fasting
they
from
high
keeping
as
strong
and
fierce
as
game
cocks
or
bull
dogs
it
does
not
signify
gentlemen
it
is
all
over
with
us
our
army
is
lost
as
sure
as
ever
it
comes
into
contact
with
the
british
i
have
hinted
these
things
more
than
once
to
general
gates
but
he
is
an
officer
who
will
take
no
counsel
but
his
own
the
truth
is
general
gates
was
one
of
that
quality
to
whom
it
is
a
misfortune
to
be
fortunate
the
least
dram
of
success
would
intoxicate
and
make
him
fool
hardy
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
believe
as
he
used
to
say
that
lord
cornwallis
would
dare
to
look
him
in
the
face
so
confident
indeed
was
he
of
victory
that
on
the
morning
before
the
fatal
action
he
ordered
marion
and
myself
to
hasten
on
to
santee
river
and
destroy
every
scow
boat
or
canoe
that
could
assist
an
englishman
in
his
flight
to
charleston
immediately
on
receiving
orders
we
waited
on
the
good
old
de
kalb
to
take
leave
and
also
to
assure
him
of
our
deep
regret
at
parting
with
him
it
is
with
equal
regret
my
dear
sirs
said
he
that
i
part
with
you
because
i
feel
a
presentiment
that
we
part
to
meet
no
more
we
told
him
we
hoped
better
things
oh
no
replied
he
it
is
impossible
war
is
a
kind
of
game
and
has
its
fixed
rules
whereby
when
we
are
well
acquainted
with
them
we
can
pretty
correctly
tell
how
the
trial
will
go
it
seems
the
die
is
to
be
cast
and
in
my
judgment
without
the
least
chance
on
our
side
the
militia
will
i
suppose
as
usual
play
the
that
is
get
out
of
the
scrape
as
fast
as
their
legs
can
carry
them
but
that
you
know
wo
do
for
me
i
am
an
old
soldier
and
can
not
run
and
i
believe
i
have
with
me
some
brave
fellows
that
will
stand
by
me
to
the
last
so
that
when
you
hear
of
our
battle
you
will
probably
hear
that
your
old
friend
de
kalb
is
at
rest
i
do
not
know
that
i
was
ever
more
affected
in
my
life
i
looked
at
marion
and
saw
that
his
eyes
were
watery
de
kalb
saw
it
too
and
taking
us
by
the
hand
with
a
firm
tone
and
animated
look
said
no
no
gentlemen
no
emotions
for
me
but
those
of
congratulation
i
am
happy
to
die
is
the
irreversible
decree
of
him
who
made
us
then
what
joy
to
be
able
to
meet
his
decree
without
dismay
this
thank
god
is
my
case
the
happiness
of
man
is
my
wish
that
happiness
i
deem
inconsistent
with
slavery
and
to
avert
so
great
an
evil
from
an
innocent
people
i
will
gladly
meet
the
british
at
any
odds
whatever
as
he
spoke
this
i
saw
a
something
in
his
eyes
which
at
once
demonstrated
the
divinity
of
virtue
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
with
sorrowful
hearts
we
then
left
him
and
with
feelings
which
i
shall
never
forget
while
memory
maintains
her
place
in
this
my
aged
brain
oh
my
god
said
marion
as
we
rode
off
what
a
difference
does
education
make
between
man
and
man
enlightened
by
her
sacred
ray
see
here
is
the
native
of
a
distant
country
come
to
fight
for
our
liberty
and
happiness
while
many
of
our
own
people
for
lack
of
education
are
actually
aiding
the
british
to
heap
chains
and
curses
upon
themselves
and
children
it
was
on
the
morning
of
august
the
that
we
left
the
army
in
a
good
position
near
rugeley
mills
twelve
miles
from
camden
where
the
enemy
lay
about
ten
that
night
orders
were
given
to
march
to
surprise
the
enemy
who
had
at
the
same
time
commenced
their
march
to
surprise
the
americans
to
their
mutual
astonishment
the
advance
of
the
two
armies
met
about
two
and
began
to
fire
on
each
other
the
firing
however
was
soon
discontinued
by
both
parties
who
appeared
very
willing
to
leave
the
matter
to
be
decided
by
daylight
a
council
of
war
was
called
in
which
de
kalb
advised
that
the
army
should
fall
back
to
rugeley
mills
and
there
in
a
good
position
wait
to
be
attacked
but
gates
not
only
rejected
this
excellent
counsel
but
threw
out
suspicions
that
it
originated
from
fear
upon
this
the
brave
old
de
kalb
called
to
his
servant
to
take
his
horse
and
leaping
on
the
ground
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
his
command
on
foot
to
this
indecent
expression
of
general
gates
he
also
retorted
with
considerable
warmth
well
sir
a
few
hours
perhaps
will
let
us
see
who
are
the
brave
it
should
be
recorded
for
the
benefit
of
our
officers
many
of
whose
laurels
have
been
blasted
by
the
fumes
of
brandy
that
general
gates
was
rather
too
fond
of
his
nocturnal
glass
i
wonder
where
we
shall
dine
said
one
of
his
officers
as
in
the
dark
they
sat
on
their
sleepy
horses
waiting
for
the
day
dine
sir
replied
the
confident
gates
why
at
camden
sir
to
be
sure
begad
i
would
not
give
a
pinch
of
snuff
sir
to
be
insured
a
in
camden
and
lord
cornwallis
at
my
table
presently
day
appeared
and
as
the
dawning
light
increased
the
frighted
militia
began
to
discover
the
woods
reddening
over
like
crimson
with
the
long
extended
lines
of
the
british
army
which
soon
with
rattling
drums
and
thundering
cannon
came
rushing
on
to
the
charge
the
militia
scarcely
waiting
to
give
them
a
distant
fire
broke
and
fled
in
the
utmost
precipitation
whereupon
gates
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
pushed
hard
after
them
as
he
said
to
bring
the
rascals
back
but
he
took
care
never
to
bring
himself
back
nor
indeed
to
stop
until
he
had
fairly
reached
charlotte
eighty
miles
from
the
field
of
battle
i
remember
it
was
common
to
talk
in
those
days
that
he
killed
three
horses
in
his
flight
gates
and
the
militia
composing
of
the
army
having
thus
shamefully
taken
themselves
off
the
brave
old
de
kalb
and
his
handful
of
continentals
were
left
alone
to
try
the
fortune
of
the
day
and
never
did
men
display
a
more
determined
valor
for
though
outnumbered
more
than
two
to
one
they
sustained
the
shock
of
the
enemy
whole
force
for
upwards
of
an
hour
with
equal
fury
the
cannon
and
muskets
were
employed
by
both
sides
until
the
contending
legions
were
nearly
mixed
then
quitting
this
slower
mode
of
slaughter
with
faces
and
fiery
eyeballs
they
plunge
forward
on
each
other
to
the
swifter
vengeance
of
the
bayonet
far
and
wide
the
woods
resound
with
the
clang
of
steel
while
the
red
reeking
weapons
like
stings
of
infernal
serpents
are
seen
piercing
the
bodies
of
the
combatants
some
on
receiving
the
fatal
stab
let
drop
their
useless
arms
and
with
dying
fingers
clasped
the
hostile
steel
that
cold
in
their
bowels
others
faintly
crying
out
o
god
i
am
slain
sank
pale
quivering
to
the
ground
while
the
vital
current
gushed
in
hissing
streams
from
their
bursted
bosoms
officers
as
well
as
men
now
mingle
in
the
uproaring
strife
and
snatching
the
weapons
of
the
slain
swell
the
horrid
carnage
glorying
in
his
continentals
the
brave
de
kalb
towers
before
them
like
a
pillar
of
fire
his
burning
face
is
like
a
red
star
guiding
their
destructive
course
his
voice
as
the
horn
that
kindles
the
young
pack
in
the
chase
of
blood
a
british
grenadier
of
giant
size
rushes
on
him
with
a
fixed
bayonet
de
kalb
parries
the
furious
blow
and
plunges
his
sword
in
the
briton
breast
then
seizing
his
falling
arms
he
deals
death
around
him
on
the
crowding
foe
loud
rise
the
shouts
of
the
americans
but
louder
still
the
shouts
of
the
more
numerous
enemy
the
battle
burns
anew
along
all
the
fierce
conflicting
line
there
the
distant
cornwallis
pushes
on
his
fresh
regiments
like
red
clouds
bursting
in
thunder
on
the
americans
and
here
condensing
his
diminished
legions
the
brave
de
kalb
still
maintains
the
unequal
contest
but
alas
what
can
valor
do
against
equal
valor
aided
by
such
fearful
odds
the
sons
of
freedom
bleed
on
every
side
with
grief
their
gallant
leader
marks
the
fall
of
his
heroes
soon
himself
to
fall
for
as
with
a
face
all
inflamed
in
the
fight
he
bends
forward
animating
his
men
he
receives
eleven
wounds
fainting
with
loss
of
blood
he
falls
to
the
ground
several
brave
men
britons
and
americans
were
killed
over
him
as
they
furiously
strove
to
destroy
or
to
defend
in
the
midst
of
the
clashing
bayonets
his
only
surviving
aid
monsieur
du
buyson
ran
to
him
and
stretching
his
arms
over
the
fallen
hero
called
out
save
the
baron
de
kalb
save
the
baron
de
kalb
the
british
officers
interposed
and
prevented
his
immediate
destruction
it
has
been
said
that
lord
cornwallis
was
so
struck
with
the
bravery
of
de
kalb
that
he
generously
superintended
while
his
wounds
were
dressed
by
his
own
surgeons
it
has
also
been
said
that
he
appointed
him
to
be
buried
with
the
honors
of
war
british
officers
have
been
often
known
to
do
such
noble
deeds
but
that
lord
cornwallis
was
capable
of
acting
so
honorably
is
doubtful
de
kalb
died
as
he
had
lived
the
unconquered
friend
of
liberty
for
being
kindly
condoled
with
by
a
british
officer
for
his
misfortune
he
replied
i
thank
you
sir
for
your
generous
sympathy
but
i
die
the
death
i
always
prayed
for
the
death
of
a
soldier
fighting
for
the
rights
of
man
his
last
moments
were
spent
in
dictating
a
letter
to
a
friend
concerning
his
continentals
of
whom
he
said
he
had
no
words
that
could
sufficiently
express
his
love
and
his
admiration
of
their
valor
he
survived
the
action
but
a
few
hours
and
was
buried
in
the
plains
of
camden
near
which
his
last
battle
was
fought
when
the
great
washington
many
years
afterwards
came
on
a
visit
to
camden
he
eagerly
inquired
for
the
grave
of
de
kalb
it
was
shown
to
him
after
looking
on
it
a
while
with
a
countenance
marked
with
thought
he
breathed
a
deep
sigh
and
exclaimed
so
there
lies
the
brave
de
kalb
the
generous
stranger
who
came
from
a
distant
land
to
fight
our
battles
and
to
water
with
his
blood
the
tree
of
our
liberty
would
to
god
he
had
lived
to
share
with
us
its
fruits
congress
ordered
him
a
monument
but
the
friend
of
tammany
still
sleeps
without
his
fame
i
have
seen
the
place
of
his
rest
it
was
the
lowest
spot
of
the
plain
no
sculptured
warrior
mourned
at
his
head
no
cypress
decked
his
heel
but
the
tall
corn
stood
in
darkening
ranks
around
him
and
seemed
to
shake
their
green
leaves
with
joy
over
his
narrow
dwelling
but
the
roar
of
his
battle
is
not
yet
quite
passed
away
nor
his
ghastly
wounds
forgotten
the
citizens
of
camden
have
lately
enclosed
his
grave
and
placed
on
it
handsome
marble
with
an
epitaph
gratefully
descriptive
of
his
virtues
and
services
that
the
people
of
future
days
may
like
washington
heave
the
sigh
when
they
read
of
the
generous
stranger
who
came
from
a
distant
land
to
fight
their
battles
and
to
water
with
his
blood

got
the
news
of
the
defeat
of
our
army
and
death
of
the
brave

marion
addresses
his
followers
their
gallant
reply
marion
and
myself
as
yet
ignorant
of
the
fate
of
the
army
were
on
the
waters
of
the
santee
very
busily
executing
our
orders
not
content
with
destroying
the
common
scows
and
flats
of
the
ferries
we
went
on
to
sweep
the
river
of
every
skiff
and
canoe
that
we
could
lay
hands
on
nay
had
the
harmless
wonkopkins
been
able
to
ferry
an
englishman
over
the
river
we
should
certainly
have
declared
war
and
hurled
our
firebrands
among
them
the
reader
may
be
sure
we
gained
no
good
will
by
our
zeal
in
this
affair
for
it
was
a
serious
thing
to
the
planters
and
their
wrath
waxed
exceedingly
hot
against
us
among
that
fleet
of
boats
and
flats
that
perished
by
our
firebrands
or
hatchets
there
were
two
that
belonged
to
my
excellent
old
uncle
colonel
horry
the
old
gentleman
could
hardly
believe
his
negroes
when
they
told
him
that
we
were
destroying
his
boats
however
to
be
satisfied
of
the
matter
he
mounted
his
horse
and
galloped
down
to
the
river
to
see
we
had
completely
done
for
his
scow
and
were
just
giving
the
finishing
blows
to
his
boat
as
he
hove
in
sight
whereupon
clapping
whip
and
spur
to
his
horse
he
came
on
as
hard
as
he
could
drive
soon
as
he
was
within
hailing
distance
of
an
ordinary
speaking
trumpet
he
began
to
bawl
hold
hold
for
god
sake
hold
then
dashing
up
with
cheeks
red
as
fire
coals
and
his
mouth
all
in
a
lather
he
roared
out
why
what
what
what
are
you
about
here
we
are
only
trying
to
kidnap
the
british
uncle
said
i
kidnap
the
d
he
replied
then
looking
around
and
seeing
how
completely
we
had
shivered
his
fine
new
boat
and
scow
he
ripped
out
again
well
here
is
a
pretty
spot
of
work
a
pretty
spot
of
work
a
brand
new
scow
and
boat
that
cost
me
only
last
spring
three
hundred
dollars
every
farthing
of
it
and
here
now
all
cut
to
smash
ruined
not
worth
a
chew
of
tobacco
why
did
mortal
flesh
ever
see
the
like
of
this
breaking
up
our
boats
why
how
are
we
to
harvest
our
rice
uncle
said
i
you
had
better
think
less
of
harvesting
your
rice
and
more
of
catching
the
muskrats
meaning
the
british
here
darting
at
me
an
eye
of
inexpressible
astonishment
and
rage
he
exclaimed
why
certainly
the
d
is
in
the
young
man
catch
the
british
why
have
you
not
heard
that
the
british
are
carrying
every
thing
before
them
have
broke
up
our
army
cut
the
regulars
to
pieces
scattered
the
militia
and
chased
general
gates
to
jericho
and
to
the
d
for
what
i
care
god
forbid
said
marion
nay
that
is
past
praying
for
replied
my
uncle
and
if
you
had
any
interest
in
heaven
you
ought
to
have
made
it
sooner
it
is
too
late
now
great
god
returned
marion
and
so
our
army
is
lost
yes
continued
my
uncle
lost
as
sure
as
a
gun
and
that
is
not
all
for
de
kalb
is
killed
sumter
surprised
and
cut
to
pieces
and
charleston
illuminated
every
night
for
joy
we
could
neither
of
us
utter
a
word
presently
my
uncle
casting
a
searching
eye
around
on
our
men
about
thirty
in
number
asked
where
our
troops
were
i
told
him
those
were
all
the
troops
we
had
i
thought
the
good
old
gentleman
would
have
gone
into
fits
he
rolled
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
smacked
his
hands
together
and
bringing
them
by
a
sudden
jerk
to
his
breast
with
a
shrill
whistle
exclaimed
mad
mad
the
young
fellow
is
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
well
i
tell
you
what
nephew
of
mine
you
may
go
about
on
the
river
chopping
the
planters
boats
at
this
rate
but
i
would
not
be
in
your
coat
my
lad
for
your
jacket
though
it
was
stiff
with
gold
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
that
why
i
mean
replied
he
that
if
you
are
not
all
of
you
knocked
on
the
head
in
three
hours
it
will
be
a
wonder
aye
what
makes
you
think
so
uncle
said
i
he
answered
you
know
my
old
waiting
man
tom
do
you
to
be
sure
i
do
said
i
i
have
known
tom
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
and
should
be
confounded
sorry
to
hear
tom
prophesy
any
harm
of
me
for
i
have
always
taken
him
to
be
a
very
true
man
of
his
word
yes
i
warrant
him
said
my
uncle
for
though
tom
is
a
negro
and
as
black
as
old
nick
yet
i
would
as
soon
take
tom
word
as
that
of
any
white
man
in
carolina
well
tom
you
know
has
a
wife
at
as
rank
a
tory
as
we
have
hereabouts
on
coming
home
this
morning
he
shook
his
head
and
said
he
was
mighty
you
and
marion
were
in
a
bad
box
for
that
he
got
it
from
one
of
the
black
waiters
in
the
house
who
overheard
the
talk
that
there
are
three
companies
of
tories
now
moulding
their
bullets
and
making
ready
to
cut
you
off
i
looked
at
marion
and
saw
battle
in
his
face
my
uncle
was
about
to
invite
us
to
the
house
but
marion
interrupted
him
by
saying
this
is
no
time
to
think
of
visiting
and
turning
to
his
trumpeter
ordered
him
to
wind
his
horn
which
was
instantly
done
then
placing
himself
at
our
head
he
dashed
off
at
a
charging
lope
with
equal
speed
we
followed
and
soon
lost
sight
of
my
uncle
horry
on
reaching
the
woods
marion
ordered
the
troop
to
halt
and
form
when
with
his
usual
modesty
he
thus
addressed
us
well
gentlemen
you
see
our
situation
widely
different
from
what
it
once
was
yes
once
we
were
a
happy
people
liberty
shone
upon
our
land
bright
as
the
sun
that
gilds
yon
fields
while
we
and
our
fathers
rejoiced
in
its
lovely
beams
gay
as
the
birds
that
enliven
our
forests
but
alas
those
golden
days
are
gone
and
the
cloud
of
war
now
hangs
dark
and
lowering
over
our
heads
our
once
peaceful
land
is
now
filled
with
uproar
and
death
foreign
ruffians
braving
us
up
to
our
very
firesides
and
altars
leave
us
no
alternative
but
slavery
or
death
two
gallant
armies
have
been
marched
to
our
assistance
but
for
lack
of
competent
commanders
both
have
been
lost
that
under
general
lincoln
after
having
been
duped
and
butchered
at
savannah
was
at
last
completely
trapped
at
charleston
and
that
under
general
gates
after
having
been
imprudently
overmarched
is
now
cut
up
at
camden
thus
are
all
our
hopes
from
the
north
entirely
at
an
end
and
poor
carolina
is
left
to
shift
for
herself
a
sad
shift
indeed
when
not
one
in
a
thousand
of
her
own
children
will
rise
to
take
her
part
but
on
the
contrary
are
madly
taking
part
with
the
enemy
against
her
and
now
my
countrymen
i
want
to
know
your
minds
as
to
my
own
that
has
long
been
made
up
i
consider
my
life
as
but
a
moment
but
i
also
consider
that
to
fill
that
moment
with
duty
is
my
all
to
guard
my
innocent
country
against
the
evils
of
slavery
seems
now
my
greatest
duty
and
therefore
i
am
determined
that
while
i
live
she
shall
never
be
enslaved
she
may
come
to
that
wretched
state
for
what
i
know
but
my
eyes
shall
never
behold
it
never
shall
she
clank
her
chains
in
my
ears
and
pointing
to
the
ignominious
badge
exclaim
it
was
your
cowardice
that
brought
me
to
this
in
answer
to
this
we
unanimously
assured
him
that
those
sentiments
and
resolutions
were
exactly
our
own
and
that
we
were
steadfastly
determined
to
die
with
him
or
conquer
for
our
country
well
then
my
brave
friends
said
he
draw
your
swords
now
for
a
circle
emblematical
of
our
eternal
union
and
pointing
your
blades
to
heaven
the
bright
throne
of
him
who
made
us
free
swear
you
will
never
be
slaves
of
britain
which
was
all
most
devoutly
done
soon
as
this
patriotic
rite
was
performed
we
all
dismounted
and
taking
our
seats
on
the
trunks
of
two
fallen
pines
that
lay
conveniently
parallel
we
made
our
simple
dinner
of
cold
roots
and
for
our
beverage
drank
of
the
lucid
stream
that
softly
murmured
by
the
reader
will
please
to
keep
in
mind
that
our
troops
consisted
of
but
thirty
mounted
militia
chiefly
gentlemen
volunteers
armed
with
muskets
and
swords
but
almost
without
powder
and
ball
how
marion
came
to
be
at
the
head
of
this
little
party
it
may
be
amusing
to
the
reader
to
hear
some
short
time
before
this
date
when
the
war
began
to
rage
in
south
carolina
a
british
captain
by
the
name
of
ardeisoff
came
up
to
georgetown
in
an
armed
vessel
and
filled
the
country
with
printed
proclamations
from
lord
cornwallis
calling
on
the
good
people
of
south
carolina
to
submit
and
take
royal
protections
numbers
of
the
ignorant
and
pusillanimous
sort
closed
with
the
offer
but
the
nobler
ones
of
the
district
williamsburgh
having
no
notion
of
selling
their
liberties
for
a
in
a
poke
called
a
caucus
of
their
own
from
whom
they
selected
captain
john
james
and
sent
him
down
to
master
captain
ardeisoff
to
know
what
he
would
be
at
this
captain
james
by
birth
an
irishman
had
rendered
himself
so
popular
in
the
district
that
he
was
made
a
militia
captain
under
the
royal
government
but
in
soon
as
he
found
that
the
ministry
were
determined
to
tax
the
americans
without
allowing
them
the
common
british
right
of
representation
he
bravely
threw
up
his
commission
declaring
that
he
would
never
serve
a
tyrant
such
was
the
gentleman
chosen
by
the
aforesaid
liberty
caucus
to
go
on
the
embassy
before
mentioned
in
the
garb
of
a
plain
planter
james
presented
himself
before
the
haughty
captain
ardeisoff
and
politely
asked
on
what
terms
himself
and
friends
must
submit
what
terms
sir
replied
the
angry
briton
what
terms
why
no
other
terms
you
may
be
sure
than
unconditional
submission
well
but
sir
answered
james
very
calmly
are
we
not
to
be
allowed
to
stay
at
home
in
peace
and
quiet
in
peace
and
quiet
indeed
replied
ardeisoff
with
a
sarcastic
grin
a
pretty
story
truly
stay
at
home
in
peace
and
quiet
heh
no
no
sir
you
have
all
rebelled
against
your
king
and
if
treated
as
you
deserve
would
now
be
dancing
like
dogs
at
the
arms
of
the
gallows
but
his
majesty
is
merciful
sir
and
now
that
he
has
graciously
pardoned
you
he
expects
you
will
immediately
take
up
arms
and
turn
out
in
support
of
his
cause
you
are
very
candid
sir
said
james
and
now
i
hope
you
will
not
be
displeased
with
me
for
being
equally
plain
permit
me
then
sir
to
tell
you
that
such
terms
will
never
go
down
with
the
gentlemen
whom
i
have
the
honor
to
represent
the
gentlemen
you
have
the
honor
to
represent
you
d
rebel
vesuvius
aetna
and
strumbolo
what
are
your
fires
and
flames
compared
with
those
that
raged
in
the
bosom
of
james
when
he
heard
himself
called
a
d
rebel
instantly
springing
up
with
eyes
of
lightning
he
snatched
up
his
chair
and
regardless
of
consequences
laid
the
audacious
ardeisoff
sprawling
on
the
floor
then
flying
to
his
horse
he
mounted
and
made
his
escape
learning
from
him
at
his
return
what
they
had
to
understand
by
protections
his
gallant
constituents
came
at
once
to
the
resolution
to
arm
and
fight
till
death
rather
than
hold
life
on
such
ignominious
terms
immediately
the
whole
force
of
the
district
about
two
hundred
able
to
bear
arms
were
mustered
and
placed
under
captains
william
john
henry
mowizon
and
our
brave
captain
james
who
was
appointed
major
and
captain
general
of
the
whole
feeling
that
distrust
in
themselves
which
is
common
with
raw
troops
and
learning
that
the
northern
army
was
just
entering
south
carolina
they
despatched
a
messenger
to
general
gates
to
request
that
he
would
send
them
an
officer
who
had
seen
service
governor
rutledge
who
happened
at
that
time
to
be
in
camp
advised
general
gates
by
all
means
to
send
marion
marion
was
accordingly
sent
but
with
orders
as
we
have
seen
to
destroy
on
his
route
all
the
boats
on
the
santee
river
lest
lord
cornwallis
should
make
his
escape
at
the
time
of
leaving
general
gates
marion
had
but
ten
men
with
him
but
on
reaching
santee
we
were
joined
by
major
john
james
with
about
twenty
gallant
gentlemen
volunteers
making
his
whole
force
about
thirty
a
slender
force
to
be
sure
to
oppose
to
the
tremendous
powers
which
marion
had
to
encounter
but
the
lord
is
king
the
victory
is
his
and
when
he
pleases
to
give
it
to
an
oppressed
people
he
can
make
the
few
and
feeble
overcome
the
many
and
mighty
as
the
brave
major
james
may
perhaps
be
mentioned
no
more
in
this
history
i
must
gratify
the
reader
by
informing
him
that
the
noble
major
lost
nothing
by
his
attachment
to
duty
and
the
rights
of
man
he
lived
to
see
cornwallis
tarleton
and
rawdon
laid
as
low
as
the
insolent
ardeisoff
and
after
enjoying
many
years
of
sweet
repose
under
the
pleasant
shade
of
peace
and
plenty
he
sunk
gently
to
rest
but
though
now
fallen
asleep
he
still
lives
in
his
country
gratitude
and
in
the
virtues
of
his
son
who
fills
one
of
the
highest
places
in
the
judiciary
of
his
native
state
chapter
carolina
apparently
lost
marion
almost
alone
keeps
the

mingo
again
smites
them
hip

on

the
history
of
the
american
revolution
is
a
history
of
miracles
all
bearing
like
sunbeams
on
this
heavenly
fiat
america
shall
be
free
some
of
our
philosophers
can
hardly
believe
when
they
read
of
samson
making
such
a
smash
among
the
philistines
with
the
jawbone
of
an
ass
then
how
will
they
believe
what
i
am
going
to
tell
them
of
marion
how
will
they
believe
that
at
a
time
when
the
british
had
completely
overrun
south
carolina
their
headquarters
at
charleston
a
victorious
army
at
camden
strong
garrisons
at
georgetown
and
jacksonborough
with
swarms
of
thievish
and
bloody
minded
tories
filling
up
all
between
and
the
spirits
of
the
poor
whigs
so
completely
cowed
that
they
were
fairly
knocked
under
to
the
civil
and
military
yoke
of
the
british
who
i
ask
again
will
believe
that
in
this
desperate
state
of
things
one
little
swarthy
carolinian
with
only
thirty
of
his
ragged
countrymen
issuing
out
of
the
swamps
should
have
dared
to
turn
his
horse
head
towards
this
all
conquering
foe
well
marion
was
that
man
he
it
was
who
with
his
feeble
force
dared
to
dash
up
at
once
to
nelson
ferry
on
the
great
war
path
between
the
british
armies
at
charleston
and
camden
now
my
gallant
friends
said
he
at
sight
of
the
road
and
with
a
face
burning
for
battle
now
look
sharp
here
are
the
british
wagon
tracks
with
the
sand
still
falling
in
and
here
are
the
steps
of
their
troops
passing
and
repassing
we
shall
not
long
be
idle
here
and
so
it
turned
out
for
scarcely
had
we
reached
our
hiding
place
in
the
swamp
before
in
came
our
scouts
at
half
speed
stating
that
a
british
guard
with
a
world
of
american
prisoners
were
on
their
march
for
charleston
how
many
prisoners
do
you
suppose
there
were
said
marion
near
two
hundred
replied
the
scouts
and
what
do
you
imagine
was
the
number
of
the
british
guard
why
sir
we
counted
about
ninety
ninety
said
marion
with
a
smile
ninety
well
that
will
do
and
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
only
stand
by
me
i
a
good
hope
that
we
thirty
will
have
those
ninety
by
sunrise
we
told
him
to
lead
on
for
that
we
were
resolved
to
die
by
his
side
soon
as
the
dusky
night
came
on
we
went
down
to
the
ferry
and
passing
for
a
party
of
good
loyalists
we
easily
got
set
over
the
enemy
with
their
prisoners
having
just
effected
the
passage
of
the
river
as
the
sun
went
down
halted
at
the
first
tavern
generally
called
the
blue
house
where
the
officers
ordered
supper
in
front
of
the
building
was
a
large
arbor
wherein
the
topers
were
wont
to
sit
and
spend
the
jocund
night
away
in
songs
and
gleeful
draughts
of
apple
brandy
grog
in
this
arbor
flushed
with
their
late
success
sat
the
british
guard
and
tickler
after
tickler
swilling
roared
it
away
to
the
tune
of
britannia
strike
home
till
overcome
with
fatigue
and
the
opiate
juice
down
they
sunk
deliciously
beastified
to
the
ground
just
as
the
cock
had
winded
his
last
horn
for
day
we
approached
the
house
in
perfect
concealment
behind
a
string
of
fence
within
a
few
yards
of
it
but
in
spite
of
all
our
address
we
could
not
effect
a
complete
surprisal
of
them
their
sentinels
took
the
alarm
and
firing
their
pieces
fled
into
the
yard
swift
as
lightning
we
entered
with
them
and
seizing
their
muskets
which
were
all
stacked
near
the
gate
we
made
prisoners
of
the
whole
party
without
having
been
obliged
to
kill
more
than
three
of
them
had
washington
and
his
whole
army
been
upon
the
survivors
they
could
hardly
have
roared
out
louder
for
quarter
after
securing
their
arms
marion
called
for
their
captain
but
he
was
not
to
be
found
high
nor
low
among
the
living
or
dead
however
after
a
hot
search
he
was
found
up
the
chimney
he
begged
very
hard
that
we
would
not
let
his
men
know
where
he
had
concealed
himself
nothing
could
equal
the
mortification
of
the
british
when
they
came
to
see
what
a
handful
of
had
taken
them
and
recovered
all
their
prisoners
marion
was
at
first
in
high
hopes
that
the
american
regulars
whom
he
had
so
gallantly
rescued
would
to
a
man
have
joined
his
arms
and
fought
hard
to
avenge
their
late
defeat
but
equally
to
his
surprise
and
their
own
disgrace
not
one
of
them
could
be
prevailed
on
to
shoulder
a
musket
where
is
the
use
said
they
of
fighting
now
when
all
is
lost
this
was
the
general
impression
and
indeed
except
these
unconquerable
spirits
marion
and
sumter
with
a
few
others
of
the
same
heroic
stamp
who
kept
the
field
carolina
was
no
better
than
a
british
province
in
our
late
attack
on
the
enemy
we
had
but
four
rounds
of
powder
and
ball
and
not
a
single
sword
that
deserved
the
name
but
marion
soon
remedied
that
defect
he
bought
up
all
the
old
saw
blades
from
the
mills
and
gave
them
to
the
smiths
who
presently
manufactured
for
us
a
parcel
of
substantial
broadswords
sufficient
as
i
have
often
seen
to
kill
a
man
at
a
single
blow
from
our
prisoners
in
the
late
action
we
got
completely
armed
a
couple
of
english
muskets
with
bayonets
and
to
each
of
us
with
which
we
retreated
into
britton
neck
we
had
not
been
there
above
hours
before
news
was
brought
us
by
a
trusty
friend
that
the
tories
on
pedee
were
mustering
in
force
under
a
captain
barfield
this
as
we
learnt
afterwards
was
one
of
the
companies
that
my
uncle
old
coachman
had
been
so
troubled
about
we
were
quickly
on
horseback
and
after
a
brisk
ride
of
forty
miles
came
upon
their
encampment
at
three
in
the
morning
their
surprise
was
so
complete
that
they
did
not
fire
a
single
shot
of
men
who
composed
their
company
we
killed
and
took
about
thirty
the
arms
ammunition
and
horses
of
the
whole
party
fell
into
our
hands
with
which
we
returned
to
britton
neck
without
the
loss
of
a
man
the
rumor
of
these
two
exploits
soon
reached
the
british
and
their
friends
the
tories
who
presently
despatched
three
stout
companies
to
attack
us
two
of
the
parties
were
british
one
of
them
commanded
by
major
weymies
of
memory
the
third
party
were
altogether
tories
we
fled
before
them
towards
north
carolina
supposing
they
had
entirely
scouted
us
they
gave
over
the
chase
and
retreated
for
their
respective
stations
the
british
to
georgetown
and
the
tories
to
black
mingo
learning
this
from
the
swift
mounted
scouts
whom
he
always
kept
close
hanging
upon
their
march
marion
ordered
us
to
face
about
and
dog
them
to
their
encampment
which
we
attacked
with
great
fury
our
fire
commenced
on
them
at
but
a
short
distance
and
with
great
effect
but
outnumbering
us
at
least
two
to
one
they
stood
their
ground
and
fought
desperately
but
losing
their
commander
and
being
hard
pressed
they
at
length
gave
way
and
fled
in
the
utmost
precipitation
leaving
upwards
of
of
their
number
killed
and
wounded
on
the
ground
the
surprise
and
destruction
of
the
tories
would
have
been
complete
had
it
not
been
for
the
alarm
given
by
our
horses
feet
in
passing
black
mingo
bridge
near
which
they
were
encamped
marion
never
afterwards
suffered
us
to
cross
a
bridge
in
the
night
until
we
had
first
spread
our
blankets
on
it
to
prevent
noise
this
third
exploit
of
marion
rendered
his
name
very
dear
to
the
poor
whigs
but
utterly
abominable
to
the
enemy
particularly
the
tories
who
were
so
terrified
at
this
last
handling
that
on
their
retreat
they
would
not
halt
a
moment
at
georgetown
though
twenty
miles
from
the
field
of
battle
but
continued
their
flight
not
thinking
themselves
safe
until
they
had
got
santee
river
between
him
and
them
these
three
spirited
charges
having
cost
us
a
great
deal
of
rapid
marching
and
fatigue
marion
said
he
would
give
us
a
little
rest
so
he
led
us
down
into
waccamaw
where
he
knew
we
had
some
excellent
friends
among
whom
were
the
hugers
and
trapiers
and
alstons
fine
fellows
rich
as
jews
and
hearty
as
we
could
wish
indeed
the
wealthy
captain
now
colonel
william
alston
was
one
of
marion
aids
these
great
people
all
received
us
as
though
we
had
been
their
brothers
threw
open
the
gates
of
their
elegant
yards
for
our
cavalry
hurried
us
up
their
princely
steps
and
notwithstanding
our
dirt
and
rags
ushered
us
into
their
grand
saloons
and
dining
rooms
where
the
famous
mahogany
sideboards
were
quickly
covered
with
pitchers
of
old
amber
colored
brandy
and
sugar
dishes
of
double
refined
with
honey
for
drams
and
juleps
our
horses
were
up
to
the
eyes
in
corn
and
fodder
while
as
to
ourselves
nothing
that
air
land
or
water
could
furnish
was
good
enough
for
us
fish
flesh
and
fowl
all
of
the
fattest
and
finest
and
sweetly
graced
with
the
smiles
of
the
great
ladies
were
spread
before
us
as
though
we
had
been
kings
while
congress
and
washington
went
round
in
sparkling
bumpers
from
old
demijohns
that
had
not
left
the
garret
for
many
a
year
this
was
feasting
indeed
it
was
a
feasting
of
the
soul
as
well
as
of
the
sense
to
have
drawn
the
sword
for
liberty
and
dear
country
sake
was
of
itself
no
mean
reward
to
honest
republicans
but
beside
that
to
be
so
honored
and
caressed
by
the
great
ones
of
the
land
was
like
throwing
the
zone
of
venus
over
the
waist
of
minerva
or
like
crowning
profit
with
pleasure
and
duty
with
delight
in
consequence
of
the
three
fortunate
blows
which
he
had
lately
struck
marion
as
before
observed
was
getting
the
enviable
honor
to
be
looked
up
to
as
the
rallying
point
of
the
poor
whigs
insomuch
that
although
afraid
as
mice
to
stir
themselves
yet
if
they
found
out
that
the
tories
and
british
were
any
where
forming
encampments
about
the
country
they
would
mount
their
boys
and
push
them
off
to
marion
to
let
him
know
here
i
must
give
the
reader
an
instance

spot

had
just
got
ourselves
well
braced
up
again
by
rest
and
high
feeding
among
the
noble
whigs
of
waccamaw

two
wagon
loads
of
guns
great
big
english
muskets

tarnal

mighty
small
man
to
fight
them
great
big
tories
there
on
pedee
but
daddy
says
as
how
the
heart
is
all
and
he
says
too
that
though
you
are
but
a
little
man
you
have
a
monstrous
great
heart
marion
smiled
and
went
out
among
his
men
to
whom
he
related
the
boy
errand
and
desired
them
to
question
him
so
that
there
might
be
no
trick
in
the
matter
but
every
scruple
of
that
sort
was
quickly
removed
for
several
of
our
party
were
well
acquainted
with
the
lad
father
and
knew
him
to
be
an
excellent
whig
having
put
our
firearms
in
prime
order
for
an
attack
we
mounted
and
giving
our
friends
three
cheers
dashed
off
just
as
the
moon
arose
and
by
daybreak
next
morning
had
gained
a
very
convenient
swamp
within
ten
miles
of
the
grand
tory
rendezvous
to
avoid
giving
alarm
we
struck
into
the
swamp
and
there
man
and
horse
lay
snug
all
day
about
eleven
marion
sent
out
a
couple
of
young
men
to
conceal
themselves
near
the
main
road
and
take
good
heed
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
evening
they
returned
and
brought
word
that
the
road
had
been
constantly
alive
with
horsemen
tories
they
supposed
armed
with
new
guns
and
all
moving
on
very
gaily
towards
the
place
the
lad
had
told
us
of
soon
as
it
was
dark
we
mounted
and
took
the
track
at
a
sweeping
gallop
which
by
early
supper
time
brought
us
in
sight
of
their
fires
then
leaving
our
horses
under
a
small
guard
we
advanced
quite
near
them
in
the
dark
without
being
discovered
for
so
little
thought
had
they
of
marion
that
they
had
not
placed
a
single
sentinel
but
were
all
hands
gathered
about
the
fire
some
cooking
some
fiddling
and
dancing
and
some
playing
cards
as
we
could
hear
them
every
now
and
then
bawling
out
huzza
at
him
again
damme
aye
that
the
dandy
my
trick
begad
poor
wretches
little
did
they
think
how
near
the
fates
were
grinning
around
them
observing
that
they
had
three
large
fires
marion
divided
our
little
party
of
sixty
men
into
three
companies
each
opposite
to
a
fire
then
bidding
us
to
take
aim
with
his
pistol
he
gave
the
signal
for
a
general
discharge
in
a
moment
the
woods
were
all
in
a
blaze
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
accompanied
by
a
tremendous
clap
of
thunder
down
tumbled
the
dead
off
bolted
the
living
loud
screamed
the
wounded
while
far
and
wide
all
over
the
woods
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
running
of
tories
and
the
snorting
of
wild
bounding
horses
snapping
the
saplings
such
a
was
hardly
ever
seen
on
running
up
to
their
fires
we
found
we
had
killed
and
badly
wounded
as
many
more
thirteen
we
made
prisoners
poor
fellows
who
had
not
been
grazed
by
a
bullet
but
were
so
frightened
that
they
could
not
budge
a
peg
we
got
stand
of
arms
chiefly
english
muskets
and
bayonets
one
hundred
horses
with
new
saddles
and
bridles
all
english
too
with
a
good
deal
of
ammunition
and
baggage
the
consternation
of
the
tories
was
so
great
that
they
never
dreamt
of
carrying
off
anything
even
their
fiddles
and
fiddle
bows
and
playing
cards
were
all
left
strewed
around
their
fires
one
of
the
gamblers
it
is
a
serious
truth
though
shot
dead
still
held
the
cards
hard
gripped
in
his
hands
led
by
curiosity
to
inspect
this
strange
sight
a
dead
gambler
we
found
that
the
cards
which
he
held
were
ace
deuce
and
jack
clubs
were
trumps
holding
high
low
jack
and
the
game
in
his
own
hand
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
fair
way
to
do
well
but
marion
came
down
upon
him
with
a
trump
that
spoiled
his
sport
and
him
for
ever
but
the
most
comfortable
sight
of
all
was
the
fine
supper
which
the
tories
had
cooked
three
fat
roasted
pigs
and
six
turkeys
with
piles
of
nice
journey
cakes
is
true
the
dead
bodies
lay
very
thick
round
the
fires
but
having
rode
seventy
miles
and
eating
nothing
since
the
night
before
we
were
too
keen
set
to
think
of
standing
on
trifles
so
fell
upon
the
poor
tories
provisions
and
made
the
heartiest
supper
in
the
world
and
to
crown
all
we
found
among
the
spoil
upwards
of
half
a
barrel
of
fine
old
peach
brandy
ah
this
brandy
said
marion
was
the
worst
foe
these
poor
rogues
ever
had
but
i
take
care
it
shall
be
no
foe
to
us
so
after
ordering
half
a
pint
to
each
man
he
had
the
balance
put
under
guard
and
i
must
observe
by
way
of
justice
to
my
honored
friend
that
success
never
seemed
to
elate
him
nor
did
ever
he
lose
sight
of
safety
in
the
blaze
of
victory
for
instantly
after
the
defeat
our
guns
were
all
loaded
and
our
sentinels
set
as
if
an
enemy
had
been
in
force
in
the
neighborhood
chapter
the
whigs
in
high
spirits
on
account
of
our
success
an
express
from
governor
rutledge
promotions
british
and
tories
in
great
wrath
sketch
of
their
treatment
of
the
patriots
the
news
of
this
fourth
overthrow
of
the
enemy
was
soon
spread
far
and
wide
among
both
our
friends
and
foes
producing
everywhere
the
liveliest
emotions
of
joy
or
sorrow
according
as
the
hearers
happened
to
be
well
or
ill
affected
towards
us
the
impression
which
it
made
on
our
honored
executive
was
sweeter
to
our
thoughts
than
honey
or
the
honeycomb
for
on
the
fifth
day
after
our
last
flaggellation
of
the
tories
in
came
an
express
from
governor
rutledge
with
a
commission
of
brigadier
general
for
marion
and
a
full
colonel
commission
for
me
having
always
looked
up
to
my
country
as
to
a
beloved
mother
whose
liberty
and
prosperity
were
inseparably
connected
with
my
own
it
is
no
wonder
that
i
should
have
been
so
delighted
at
hearing
her
say
by
her
favorite
son
governor
rutledge
that
especial
trust
in
my
courage
conduct
and
attention
to
her
interests
she
had
appointed
me
a
colonel
in
her
armies
scarcely
had
i
perused
my
commission
before
marion
reached
me
his
and
with
a
smile
desired
me
to
read
it
soon
as
i
came
to
his
new
title
brigadier
general
i
snatched
his
hand
and
exclaimed
huzza
god
save
my
friend
my
noble
general
marion
general
general
aye
that
will
do
that
will
do
that
sounds
somewhat
in
unison
with
your
deserts
well
but
what
do
you
think
of
the
style
replied
he
and
of
the
prerogative
is
it
not
prodigiously
in
the
pompous
not
at
all
said
i
no
continued
he
why
now
to
my
notion
it
is
very
much
in
the
turgid
in
the
asiatic
it
gives
me
dominions
from
river
to
river
and
from
the
mountains
to
the
great
sea
like
tamerlane
or
ghengis
khan
or
like
george
iii
the
grace
of
god
king
of
great
britain
france
whereas
poor
george
dares
not
set
a
foot
there
even
to
pick
up
a
periwinkle
well
but
general
said
i
as
the
english
gave
france
to
george
because
they
wish
him
to
have
it
so
i
suppose
the
good
governor
gives
you
this
vast
district
for
the
same
reason
perhaps
so
replied
marion
the
truth
is
governor
rutledge
was
a
most
ardent
lover
of
his
country
and
therefore
almost
adored
such
an
unconquerable
patriot
as
marion
hence
when
he
found
that
notwithstanding
the
many
follies
and
failures
of
northern
generals
and
armies
notwithstanding
the
victories
and
proclamations
and
threats
of
cornwallis
and
tarleton
marion
still
stood
his
ground
and
fought
and
conquered
for
carolina
his
whole
soul
was
so
filled
with
love
of
him
that
i
verily
believe
he
would
have
given
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
the
glory
thereof
had
they
been
in
his
gift
indeed
what
he
did
give
him
was
sketched
out
with
a
prodigiously
bold
hand
he
gave
him
all
that
territory
comprehended
within
a
line
drawn
from
charleston
along
the
sea
to
georgetown
thence
westerly
to
camden
and
thence
to
charleston
again
making
a
domain
of
extent
population
and
wealth
immense
but
over
which
the
excellent
governor
had
no
more
power
to
grant
military
jurisdiction
than
to
give
kingdoms
in
the
moon
for
the
whole
of
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
british
and
their
friends
the
tories
so
that
the
governor
had
not
a
foot
to
give
marion
nor
did
marion
hold
a
foot
of
it
but
by
his
own
vigilance
and
valor
which
were
so
extraordinary
that
his
enemies
with
all
their
men
money
and
malice
could
never
drive
him
out
of
it
but
while
governor
rutledge
with
all
the
good
whigs
of
the
state
were
thus
heartily
rejoicing
with
marion
for
his
victories
the
british
and
tories
were
as
madly
gnashing
their
teeth
upon
him
for
the
same
to
be
struck
four
such
severe
blows
in
so
short
a
time
and
all
rising
one
over
another
in
such
cursed
climax
of
bad
to
worse
to
be
losing
in
this
manner
their
dear
allies
with
all
their
subsidies
of
arms
ammunition
and
money
to
have
their
best
friends
thus
cooled
their
worst
enemies
thus
heated
and
rank
rebellion
again
breaking
up
out
of
a
soil
where
they
had
promised
themselves
nothing
but
the
richest
fruits
of
passive
obedience
and
all
this
by
a
little
ugly
spawn
of
a
frenchman
it
was
too
much
they
could
not
stand
it
revenge
they
must
and
would
have
that
was
certain
and
since
with
all
their
efforts
they
could
not
get
at
marion
the
hated
trunk
and
root
of
all
they
were
determined
to
burn
and
sweat
his
branches
the
poor
whigs
to
carry
the
curses
of
fire
and
sword
through
all
their
families
and
habitations
now
had
this
savage
spirit
appeared
among
a
few
poor
british
cadets
or
piney
wood
tories
it
would
not
have
been
so
lamentable
their
ignorance
of
those
divine
truths
which
exalt
the
soul
above
such
hellish
passions
would
have
furnished
some
plea
for
them
but
that
a
british
general
and
that
general
a
nobleman
a
lord
with
an
archbishop
for
his
brother
and
bibles
and
morocco
prayer
books
and
all
such
excellent
helps
to
teach
him
that
god
is
love
and
mercy
his
delight
that
such
a
one
i
say
should
have
originated
the
infernal
warfare
of
plundering
burning
and
hanging
the
american
patriots
is
most
horrible
and
yet
if
possible
more
true
than
horrible
yes
sure
as
the
day
of
doom
when
that
fearful
day
shall
come
and
lord
cornwallis
stript
of
his
brief
authority
shall
stand
a
trembling
ghost
before
that
equal
bar
then
shall
the
evil
spirit
from
the
black
budget
of
his
crimes
snatch
the
following
bloody
order
and
grinning
an
insulting
smile
flash
it
before
his
terrified
optics
august
to
lieutenant
colonel
cruger
commandant
at
the
british
garrison
at
sir
i
have
given
orders
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
province
who
had
submitted
and
who
have
taken
a
part
in
this
revolt
shall
be
punished
with
the
greatest
rigour
that
they
shall
be
imprisoned
and
their
whole
property
taken
from
them
or
destroyed
i
have
likewise
directed
that
compensation
should
be
made
out
of
their
effects
to
persons
who
have
been
plundered
and
oppressed
by
them
i
have
ordered
in
the
most
positive
manner
that
every
who
had
borne
arms
with
us
and
had
afterwards
joined
the
enemy
should
be
immediately
hanged
i
have
now
sir
only
to
desire
that
you
will
take
the
most
vigorous
measures
to
extinguish
the
rebellion
in
the
district
which
you
command
and
that
you
will
obey
in
the
strictest
manner
the
directions
i
have
given
in
this
letter
relative
to
the
treatment
of
this
country
this
order
of
lord
cornwallis
proved
to
south
carolina
like
the
opening
of
pandora
box
instantly
there
broke
forth
a
torrent
of
cruelties
and
crimes
never
before
heard
of
in
our
simple
forests
lord
rawdon
acted
as
we
shall
see
a
shameful
part
in
these
bloody
tragedies
and
so
did
colonel
tarleton
but
the
officer
who
figured
most
in
executing
the
detestable
orders
of
cornwallis
was
a
major
weymies
this
man
was
by
birth
a
scotsman
but
in
principle
and
practice
a
mohawk
so
totally
destitute
was
he
of
that
amiable
sympathy
which
belongs
to
his
nation
that
in
sailing
up
winyaw
bay
and
waccamaw
and
pedee
rivers
he
landed
and
pillaged
and
burnt
every
house
he
durst
approach
such
was
the
style
of
his
entry
upon
our
afflicted
state
and
such
the
spirit
of
his
doings
throughout
for
wherever
he
went
an
unsparing
destruction
awaited
upon
his
footsteps
unhappily
our
country
had
but
too
many
pupils
that
fitted
exactly
such
a
preceptor
the
lazy
tories
all
gloried
in
major
weymies
and
were
ever
ready
at
the
winding
of
his
horn
to
rush
forth
with
him
like
hungry
bloodhounds
on
his
predatory
excursions
the
dogs
of
hell
were
all
now
completely
uncoupled
and
every
devilish
passion
in
man
had
its
proper
game
to
fly
at
here
was
a
fine
time
for
malice
to
feed
her
ancient
grudges
for
avarice
to
cram
her
maw
with
plunder
and
revenge
to
pay
off
her
old
scores
with
bloody
interest
a
thievish
tory
who
had
been
publicly
whipped
by
a
whig
magistrate
or
had
long
coveted
his
silver
tankard
or
his
handsome
rifle
or
his
elegant
horse
had
but
to
point
out
his
house
to
major
weymies
and
say
there
lives
a
d
d
rebel
the
amiable
major
and
his
myrmidons
would
surround
the
noble
building
in
a
trice
and
after
gutting
it
of
all
its
rich
furniture
would
reduce
it
to
ashes
it
was
in
vain
that
the
poor
delicate
mother
and
her
children
on
bended
knees
with
wringing
hands
and
eyes
implored
him
to
pity
and
not
to
burn
their
house
over
their
heads
such
eloquence
which
has
often
moved
the
breasts
of
savages
was
all
lost
on
major
weymies
and
his
banditti
they
no
more
regarded
the
sacred
cries
of
children
than
the
indians
do
the
cries
of
the
young
beavers
whose
houses
they
are
breaking
up
but
oh
joy
eternal
the
lord
is
king
his
law
is
love
and
they
who
sin
against
this
law
soon
or
late
shall
find
that
they
have
sinned
against
their
own
souls
a
planter
in
his
fields
accidentally
turning
towards
his
house
suddenly
discovers
a
vast
column
of
smoke
bursting
forth
and
ascending
in
black
curling
volumes
to
heaven
oh
my
god
my
house
he
exclaims
my
poor
wife
and
children
then
half
bereft
of
his
senses
he
sets
off
and
runs
towards
his
house
still
as
he
cuts
the
air
he
groans
out
oh
my
poor
wife
and
children
presently
he
hears
their
cries
he
sees
them
at
a
distance
with
outstretched
arms
flying
towards
him
oh
pa
pa
pa
his
children
tremblingly
exclaim
while
his
wife
all
pale
and
out
of
breath
falls
on
his
bosom
and
feebly
crying
out
the
british
oh
the
british
sinks
into
a
swoon
who
can
tell
the
feelings
of
the
father
and
the
husband
his
wife
convulsed
in
his
arms
his
little
beggared
children
screaming
around
him
and
his
property
all
sinking
to
ruin
by
merciless
enemies
presently
his
wife
after
a
strong
fit
with
a
deep
sigh
comes
to
herself
he
wipes
her
tears
he
embraces
and
hushes
his
children
by
and
bye
supposing
the
british
to
be
gone
arm
in
arm
the
mournful
group
return
but
ah
shocking
sight
their
once
stately
mansion
which
shone
so
beauteous
on
the
plain
the
pride
and
pleasure
of
their
eyes
is
now
the
prey
of
devouring
flames
their
slaves
have
all
disappeared
their
stock
part
is
taken
away
part
lies
bleeding
in
the
yard
stabbed
by
bayonets
their
elegant
furniture
tables
glasses
clocks
beds
all
is
swallowed
up
an
army
of
passing
demons
could
have
done
no
worse
but
while
with
tearful
eye
they
are
looking
round
on
the
ruin
undermined
by
the
fire
down
comes
the
tall
building
with
thundering
crash
to
the
ground
the
frightened
mourners
start
aghast
from
the
hideous
squelch
and
weep
afresh
to
see
all
the
hopes
and
glories
of
their
state
thus
suddenly
ended
in
smoke
and
ashes
it
was
in
this
way
exactly
that
the
british
treated
my
brother
major
hugh
horry
as
brave
a
soldier
as
ever
fought
in
america
they
laid
in
ashes
all
his
dwelling
houses
his
barns
of
clean
rice
and
even
his
rice
stacks
destroyed
his
cattle
carried
off
eighty
negroes
which
were
all
he
had
not
leaving
him
one
to
bake
him
a
cake
thus
in
one
hour
as
the
wild
arabs
served
job
did
the
british
serve
my
poor
brother
breaking
him
up
root
and
branch
and
from
a
state
of
affluence
reduced
him
to
a
dunghill
these
savage
examples
first
set
by
the
british
and
followed
by
the
tories
soon
produced
the
effect
which
marion
had
all
along
predicted
they
filled
the
hearts
of
the
sufferers
with
the
deadliest
hate
of
the
british
and
brought
them
in
crowds
to
join
his
standard
with
muskets
in
their
hands
and
vows
of
revenge
eternal
in
their
mouths
hence
it
was
that
nothing
so
pleased
marion
as
to
hear
of
british
cruelty
to
his
countrymen
is
a
harsh
medicine
he
used
to
say
but
it
is
necessary
for
there
is
nothing
else
that
will
work
them
and
unless
they
are
well
worked
and
scoured
of
their
mother
milk
or
beastling
partiality
to
the
english
they
are
lost
our
country
is
like
a
man
who
has
swallowed
a
mortal
poison
give
him
an
anodyne
to
keep
him
easy
and
he
a
dead
man
but
if
you
can
only
knock
him
about
and
so
put
the
poison
in
motion
as
to
make
him
deadly
sick
at
the
stomach
and
heave
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
in
his
throat
he
is
safe
cornwallis
has
all
this
time
been
lulling
them
by
his
proclamations
and
protections
and
lies
but
thank
god
that
time
is
pretty
well
over
now
for
these
unfeeling
monsters
these
children
of
the
devil
have
let
out
the
cloven
foot
and
the
thing
is
now
beginning
to
work
as
i
expected
our
long
deluded
people
are
opening
their
eyes
and
beginning
to
see
and
smell
the
blood
and
burnings
of
that
that
political
hell
of
slavery
and
ruin
to
which
the
british
army
is
now
endeavoring
by
murder
and
rapine
to
reduce
them
this
was
truly
the
case
for
every
day
the
whigs
were
coming
into
marion
camp
those
who
were
too
old
to
fight
themselves
would
call
upon
their
sturdy
boys
to
turn
out
and
join
general
marion
it
was
diverting
to
see
how
they
would
come
staving
upon
their
tackies
belted
round
with
their
powderhorns
and
shotbags
with
rifles
in
hand
and
their
humble
homespun
streaming
in
the
air
the
finely
curling
smile
brightened
in
the
face
of
marion
and
his
eye
beamed
that
laughing
joy
with
which
a
father
meets
his
thoughtless
boy
returning
dirty
and
beaten
by
blackguards
from
whose
dangerous
company
he
had
sought
in
vain
a
thousand
times
to
wean
him

anecdote
of
an

lad
soon
after
this
last
victory
on
pedee
marion
moved
down
into
the
neighborhood
of
black
river
where
he
instantly
got
notice
that
a
large
body
of
tories
under
the
celebrated
tynes
were
making
great
preparations
to
attack
him
this
tynes
was
a
man
of
valor
and
address
worthy
of
a
better
cause
in
several
contests
with
the
whigs
he
had
handled
them
very
roughly
and
was
become
such
a
terror
to
the
friends
of
liberty
in
that
part
of
the
world
that
they
were
greatly
alarmed
on
finding
that
he
was
mustering
all
his
forces
to
attack
marion
we
were
scarcely
encamped
before
three
expresses
arrived
from
the
whig
settlements
on
black
river
stating
colonel
tynes
movements
and
advising
to
keep
a
good
look
out
for
that
he
was
a
very
artful
and
dangerous
fellow
according
to
their
conjectures
colonel
tynes
must
have
had
no
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
our
number
did
not
quite
reach
ninety
but
they
were
all
volunteers
and
exceedingly
chafed
and
desperate
in
their
minds
by
the
barbarous
usage
of
the
british
and
tories
having
by
this
day
march
of
fifty
miles
got
within
twenty
miles
of
the
enemy
who
supposed
that
we
were
still
on
pedee
marion
instantly
resolved
to
attack
him
that
night
no
sooner
was
this
made
known
to
the
troops
than
the
fatigues
of
the
day
appeared
to
be
entirely
forgotten
all
hands
fell
to
work
currying
rubbing
and
feeding
their
horses
like
young
men
preparing
for
a
ball
or
barbecue
then
after
a
hearty
supper
and
a
few
hours
sleep
we
all
sprung
upon
our
chargers
again
and
dashed
off
about
one
to
try
our
fortune
with
colonel
tynes
just
before
day
we
came
upon
the
enemy
whom
we
found
buried
in
sleep
the
roar
of
our
guns
first
broke
their
slumbers
and
by
the
time
the
frightened
wretches
had
got
upon
their
legs
man
and
horse
we
were
among
them
hewing
down

and
thirty
fell
under
our
swords

about
sixty
made
their
escape
colonel
tynes
himself
with
upwards
of
one
hundred
horses
and
all
the
baggage
fell
into
our
hands
a
day
or
two
after
this
victory
the
general
ordered
me
to
take
captain
baxter
lieutenant
postell
and
sergeant
macdonald
with
thirty
privates
and
see
if
i
could
not
gain
some
advantage
over
the
enemy
near
the
lines
of
georgetown
about
midnight
we
crossed
black
river
and
pushing
on
in
great
silence
through
the
dark
woods
arrived
at
dawn
of
day
near
the
enemy
sentries
where
we
lay
in
ambush
close
on
the
road
just
after
the
usual
hour
of
breakfast
a
chair
with
a
couple
of
young
ladies
by
a
brace
of
british
officers
elegantly
mounted
came
along
at
a
sweeping
rate
from
georgetown
they
had
not
passed
us
more
than
fifty
steps
before
they
stopped
short
i
was
confoundedly
afraid
at
first
that
they
had
somehow
or
other
smelt
a
rat
but
it
turned
out
as
we
afterwards
learned
that
this
was
only
a
little
courting
party
going
into
the
country
to
dine
on
getting
into
the
gloomy
woods
the
girls
were
taken
with
a
quaking
fit
for
their
sweethearts
lest
that
vile
swamp
fox
as
they
called
marion
should
come
across
them
whereupon
the
halt
aforesaid
was
ordered
and
a
consultation
held
the
result
of
which
was
that
the
girls
should
go
on
to
their
friend
house
and
the
officers
back
to
town
for
a
party
of
dragoons
accordingly
the
chair
proceeded
and
the
officers
galloped
back
by
us
undisturbed
for
we
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
risk
an
alarm
for
the
sake
of
a
couple
of
officers
presently
beginning
to
feel
very
hungry
for
we
had
travelled
all
night
and
eaten
nothing
we
agreed
to
retire
to
the
house
of
a
neighboring
planter
who
was
known
to
be
a
good
whig
as
we
entered
the
yard
what
should
we
see
but
the
identical
chair
that
had
passed
us
a
little
before
and
on
stepping
into
the
house
behold
the
very
same
young
ladies
they
were
richly
dressed
and
well
formed
and
would
no
doubt
have
appeared
handsome
but
for
the
hostile
passions
which
glared
from
their
eyes
and
gave
their
whole
physiognomy
a
expression
they
asked
us
with
great
pertness
what
business
we
had
there
the
gentleman
of
the
house
continued
they
is
not
at
home
and
there
are
no
provisions
here
for
you
and
to
be
sure
you
are
too
much
of
gentlemen
to
think
of
frightening
a
family
of
poor
helpless
women
happily
i
made
no
reply
for
while
these
young
viragoes
were
catechising
us
at
this
rate
i
discovered
with
much
pleasure
that
the
lady
of
the
house
did
not
utter
a
word
but
walked
the
room
backward
and
forward
with
a
smiling
countenance
presently
she
went
out
and
showing
herself
at
an
opposite
window
beckoned
me
to
come
to
her
when
she
said
in
a
low
voice
go
back
into
the
house
i
be
there
directly
on
my
stepping
in
you
must
demand
provisions
i
will
deny
that
i
have
any
you
must
then
get
into
a
violent
passion
and
swear
you
will
have
them
or
set
the
house
on
fire
i
will
then
throw
down
the
keys
and
you
can
take
just
what
you
want
for
thank
god
there
is
enough
both
for
you
and
your
horses
such
was
the
farce
which
the
whigs
in
those
days
both
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
obliged
to
play
when
they
had
any
of
their
tory
acquaintance
about
them
we
now
played
it
and
with
the
desired
success
for
the
troughs
in
the
yard
were
all
presently
filled
with
corn
and
fodder
for
our
cavalry
while
for
ourselves
the
cook
wenches
soon
served
up
a
most
welcome
repast
of
fried
bacon
and
eggs
with
nice
hearth
cakes
and
butter
and
milk
god
be
praised
said
we
and
down
we
sat
and
made
a
breakfast
of
which
even
kings
without
exercise
and
keen
appetites
can
form
no
idea
just
as
we
had
got
completely
refreshed
and
braced
up
again
what
should
we
hear
but
the
firing
of
our
sentinels
to
horse
to
horse
my
brave
fellows
was
the
cry
of
one
and
all
quick
as
thought
we
were
all
mounted
and
formed
when
in
came
our
sentinels
with
the
british
dragoons
hard
after
them
smack
up
to
the
fence
charge
boys
charge
was
the
word
in
a
moment
the
yard
was
bright
with
the
shining
of
our
swords
the
tory
girls
shrieked
out
for
their
sweethearts
oh
the
british
the
british
murder
murder
oh
then
off
we
went
all
at
once
in
solid
column
the
enemy
took
to
their
heels
and
we
pursued
over
the
fence
we
bounded
like
stags
down
the
hill
went
the
british
down
the
hill
went
we
man
and
horse
we
flew
roaring
through
the
woods
like
the
sound
of
distant
thunder
we
were
all
excellently
mounted
but
there
was
no
horse
that
could
hold
the
way
with
selim
he
was
the
hindmost
of
all
when
the
chase
began
and
i
wondered
at
first
what
had
become
of
selim
but
presently
i
saw
him
and
macdonald
coming
up
on
my
right
like
a
thundergust
indeed
with
his
nostrils
and
long
extended
neck
and
glaring
eyeballs
he
seemed
as
a
flying
dragon
in
chase
of
his
prey
he
soon
had
his
master
up
with
the
enemy
i
saw
when
macdonald
drew
his
claymore
the
shining
of
his
steel
was
terrible
as
rising
on
his
stirrups
with
arm
he
waved
it
three
times
in
fiery
circles
over
his
head
as
if
to
call
up
all
his
strength
then
with
a
voice
of
thunder
he
poured
his
charging
shout
dreadful
as
the
roar
of
the
lion
when
close
up
to
his
game
with
hideous
paws
unclenched
he
makes
his
last
spring
on
the
fat
buffaloes
of
his
chase
though
their
mortal
enemy
i
could
not
but
pity
the
poor
fugitives
for
i
saw
that
their
death
was
at
hand
one
of
the
british
officers
fired
a
pistol
at
him
but
without
effect
before
he
could
try
another
he
was
cut
down
by
macdonald
after
this
at
a
blow
a
piece
he
sealed
the
eyes
of
three
dragoons
in
lasting
sleep
two
fell
beneath
the
steel
of
the
snipes
nor
did
my
sword
return
bloodless
to
its
scabbard
in
short
of
the
whole
party
consisting
of
not
a
man
escaped
except
one
officer
who
in
the
heat
of
the
chase
and
carnage
cunningly
shot
off
at
right
angles
for
a
swamp
which
he
luckily
gained
and
so
cleared
himself
the
name
of
this
officer
was
meriot
and
as
finished
a
gentleman
he
was
too
as
i
ever
saw
i
got
acquainted
with
him
after
the
war
at
new
york
soon
as
the
ceremony
of
introduction
was
over
he
smiled
and
asked
if
i
were
not
in
the
skirmish
just
related
on
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
again
inquired
if
i
did
not
recollect
how
handsomely
one
of
the
british
officers
gave
me
the
slip
that
day
i
told
him
i
did
well
continued
he
i
was
that
officer
and
of
all
the
frights
i
ever
had
in
my
life
that
was
the
most
complete
will
you
believe
me
sir
when
i
assure
you
that
i
went
out
that
morning
with
my
locks
of
as
bright
an
auburn
as
ever
curled
upon
the
forehead
of
youth
and
by
the
time
i
had
crawled
out
of
the
swamp
into
georgetown
that
night
they
were
as
gray
as
a
badger
i
was
well
nigh
taking
an
oath
never
to
forgive
you
during
breath
for
frightening
me
so
confoundedly
but
away
with
all
malice
let
it
go
to
the
devil
where
it
belongs
so
come
you
must
go
dine
with
me
and
i
show
you
a
lovelier
woman
than
either
of
those
that
rode
in
the
chair
that
day
i
went
with
him
and
was
introduced
to
his
wife
a
lovely
woman
indeed
to
whom
with
great
glee
he
related
the
whole
history
of
the
chase
and
his
own
narrow
escape
and
then
laughed
very
heartily
but
not
so
his
gentle
partner
for
as
he
told
of
the
shrill
whizzing
of
our
swords
close
behind
him
and
of
the
groans
of
his
dragoons
as
they
fell
cut
down
from
their
horses
her
face
turned
pale
and
pensive
then
looking
at
him
with
great
tenderness
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
to
think
how
near
her
husband
had
been
to
death
meriot
looked
with
pleasure
on
the
troubled
countenance
of
his
lovely
wife
because
he
well
knew
the
fond
source
of
her
troubles
then
snatching
up
a
goblet
of
sangree
richly
mantled
over
with
nutmeg
he
presented
it
to
her
ruby
lips
saying
come
my
dear
drink
and
forget
the
past
then
taking
my
hand
with
great
cordiality
he
exclaimed
well
colonel
horry
we
have
been
foes
but
thank
god
we
are
good
friends
again
and
now
let
me
drink
to
you
a
sentiment
of
my
heart
friendship
in
marble
enmity
in
dust
the
behavior
of
this
noble
englishman
has
often
served
to
deepen
my
abhorrence
of
war
which
too
frequently
sets
those
to
cutting
each
other
throats
who
were
born
to
be
brothers
but
to
return
to
our
story
meriot
you
say
and
his
brother
officer
brought
pigs
to
a
bad
market
yes
indeed
but
not
a
jot
worse
than
some
of
their
friends
came
to
the
very
day
afterwards
on
the
morning
of
that
day
marion
now
concealed
in
the
swamps
near
georgetown
was
pleased
to
order
me
out
on
a
second
excursion
take
captain
snipes
said
he
with
thirty
men
and
proceed
down
the
sandpit
road
in
quest
of
the
enemy
the
moment
you
discover
them
whether
british
or
tories
charge
with
spirit
and
i
warrant
your
success
as
we
approached
the
bridge
still
moving
on
very
circumspectly
in
the
woods
we
discovered
at
a
short
distance
a
body
of
horsemen
perhaps
a
hundred
apparently
in
great
confusion
and
very
anxious
to
form
instantly
we
took
the
road
and
clapping
spurs
to
our
horses
dashed
upon
them
at
full
speed
at
the
same
time
shouting
as
we
rushed
on
the
enemy
broke
and
fled
in
all
directions
we
pursued
then
you
might
have
seen
the
woods
all
covered
with
armed
men
some
flying
others
pursuing
and
with
muskets
and
pistols
and
swords
shooting
and
cutting
down
as
fast
as
they
could
from
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
and
rapidity
of
the
charge
my
men
were
all
soon
out
of
sight
leaving
with
me
but
a
lad
of
fourteen
named
gwinn
who
carried
a
musket
at
that
instant
a
party
of
nine
or
ten
men
were
seen
advancing
whom
i
took
for
whigs
and
challenged
as
such
asking
if
they
were
not
friends
friends
o
yes
replied
their
captain
one
lewis
friends
to
be
sure
friends
to
king
george
quick
as
thought
off
went
gwinn
musket
close
by
my
side
and
down
tumbled
captain
lewis
from
his
horse
with
a
heavy
squelch
to
the
ground
but
in
the
very
instant
of
receiving
his
death
his
musket
which
was
raised
to
kill
me
took
fire
and
shot
my
horse
dead
on
the
spot
seeing
my
horse
drop
gwinn
dismounted
and
led
his
horse
up
to
me
in
a
moment
happily
for
us
both
captain
snipes
heard
the
report
of
our
pieces
and
thinking
that
we
might
be
in
danger
dashed
on
to
our
aid
with
several
of
my
troops
whooping
and
huzzaing
as
they
came
on
the
tory
party
then
fired
at
us
but
without
effect
and
fled
leaving
four
of
marion
men
whom
they
had
just
taken
and
beaten
very
barbarously
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
this
was
a
fatal
day
to
the
tories
who
must
have
lost
more
than
half
their
number
for
i
had
with
me
not
only
macdonald
and
snipes
but
several
other
very
strong
and
brave
men
whose
families
had
suffered
very
severely
by
british
and
tory
cruelty
and
i
am
afraid
they
did
not
forget
this
when
their
swords
were
hanging
over
the
heads
of
the
fugitives
at
any
rate
they
took
but
few
prisoners
in
the
course
of
this
day
fighting
there
happened
an
affair
which
served
to
amuse
us
not
a
little
on
our
return
to
our
camp
that
night
the
tories
who
from
time
to
time
had
fallen
into
our
hands
were
often
easing
their
vexation
by
saying
that
it
was
true
marion
had
proved
too
cunning
for
colonel
tynes
and
captain
barfield
and
other
british
and
loyal
officers
whom
he
had
attacked
but
that
there
was
still
one
left
behind
who
they
were
sure
if
he
could
come
forward
would
soon
show
us
quite
a
different
sort
of
play
and
that
was
colonel
gainey
from
the
head
waters
of
pedee
we
answered
that
it
was
all
very
well
and
that
we
should
be
glad
to
see
colonel
gainey
now
as
god
was
pleased
to
have
it
who
should
it
be
that
with
of
his
number
we
had
been
chasing
so
but
colonel
gainey
a
stout
fellow
he
was
too
and
most
nobly
mounted
macdonald
made
a
dash
at
him
in
full
confidence
of
getting
a
gallant
charger
but
the
good
book
tells
us
that
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
and
owing
partly
to
the
fleetness
of
his
horse
and
partly
to
a
most
extraordinary
sort
of
accident
colonel
gainey
made
his
escape
from
our
scotsman
the
chase
was
towards
georgetown
distant
little
more
than
two
miles
never
on
earth
did
two
horses
or
horsemen
make
greater
exertions
fear
impelling
the
one
fury
urging
the
other
macdonald
declared
that
in
the
chase
he
had
passed
several
tories
whom
he
could
easily
have
cut
down
but
like
the
lion
in
pursuit
of
a
favorite
buffalo
he
took
no
notice
of
them
his
eye
was
fixed
on
colonel
gainey
just
as
they
turned
richmond
corner
selim
had
brought
his
master
near
enough
to
his
prey
to
make
a
stroke
at
him
with
his
bayonet
by
a
sudden
jerk
it
is
supposed
the
weapon
turned
so
that
when
macdonald
drew
back
the
carbine
he
left
the
bayonet
up
to
the
hilt
in
his
back
in
this
way
colonel
gainey
rode
into
town

his
own

it

and
here
i
must
relate
a
tragical
affair
that
befell
us
that
day
and
which
filled
us
all
with
grief
because
of
our
beloved
general
i
mean
the
barbarous
murder
of
his
nephew
of
all
men
who
ever
drew
the
sword
marion
was
one
of
the
most
humane
he
not
only
prevented
all
cruelty
in
his
own
presence
but
strictly
forbade
it
in
his
absence
i
have
known
him
to
talk
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
together
with
one
of
his
men
for
striking
over
the
head
a
horse
that
had
started
and
to
punish
another
for
taking
away
from
a
negro
his
ragged
chicken
to
reason
then
like
men
one
would
suppose
that
he
was
the
last
person
on
whom
such
a
cruel
blow
as
the
murder
of
a
favorite
nephew
should
have
fallen
but
thanks
to
god
for
that
most
comfortable
doctrine
that
not
even
a
sparrow
can
die
until
his
has
been
signed
in
heaven
and
since
this
young
man
did
die
at
that
time
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
was
the
right
time
the
manner
of
his
death
was
this
we
have
told
the
reader
that
in
the
course
of
this
day
fighting
we
retook
from
the
tories
four
of
marion
men
whom
they
had
very
barbarously
beaten
with
the
butts
of
their
guns
on
being
asked
how
they
came
to
fall
into
such
bad
company
they
said
that
immediately
after
sending
me
off
in
the
morning
marion
got
information
that
a
party
of
tories
were
encamped
not
far
distant
on
a
plantation
of
colonel
alston
called
the
penns
captain
m
was
despatched
to
surprise
them
but
he
played
his
cards
so
badly
that
instead
of
surprising
them
they
surprised
him
killed
several
of
his
men
and
took
the
others
among
the
prisoners
was
the
general
nephew
lieutenant
gabriel
marion
of
the
continentals
who
happening
at
that
time
on
a
visit
to
his
uncle
turned
out
a
volunteer
and
was
taken
the
tories
murdered
several
of
their
unfortunate
prisoners
in
cold
blood
by
first
beating
them
over
the
head
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
and
then
shooting
them
they
said
that
lieutenant
marion
at
sight
of
such
horrid
scenes
appeared
much
shocked
and
seeing
among
them
a
man
who
had
often
been
entertained
at
his
uncle
table
he
flew
to
him
for
protection
and
threw
himself
into
his
arms
the
man
seemed
greatly
distressed
and
tried
hard
to
save
him
but
the
others
roared
out
that
he
was
one
of
the
breed
of
that
d
d
old
rebel
and
that
they
would
have
his
heart
blood
they
moreover
swore
with
the
most
horrid
oaths
that
if
the
man
did
not
instantly
push
young
marion
from
him
they
would
blow
him
through
also
the
unfortunate
youth
being
then
thrust
from
the
side
of
his
friend
was
immediately
destroyed
i
hope
the
tender
mercies
of
god
are
so
great
as
not
to
let
our
unworthiness
prevent
him
from
always
doing
what
is
exactly
right
and
good
for
us
we
ought
not
therefore
to
breathe
a
wish
different
from
the
will
and
order
of
providence
but
still
to
us
it
seems
a
great
pity
we
did
not
get
notice
of
captain
m
advancing
we
could
have
made
a
handsome
joint
attack
of
it
and
thereby
not
only
have
prevented
the
horrid
murders
above
related
but
have
scourged
those
barbarians
as
they
deserved
for
we
heard
the
firing
but
thought
it
was
colonel
alston
people
killing
beeves
among
the
very
few
prisoners
that
we
made
in
our
last
action
was
a
mulatto
fellow
who
was
suspected
to
be
one
of
those
who
had
murdered
the
general
nephew
whether
the
suspicion
was
well
or
ill
founded
i
can
not
say
but
certain
it
is
that
the
indignation
excited
against
him
on
that
account
soon
proved
his
destruction
for
as
we
were
crossing
the
swamps
of
black
river
that
night
an
officer
rode
up
to
him
while
marching
in
the
line
of
prisoners
under
guard
and
with
a
pistol
shot
him
dead
on
the
spot
the
captain
of
the
guard
was
instantly
sent
for
and
severely
reprimanded
by
the
general
for
not
having
killed
the
author
of
that
savage
deed
it
was
said
the
officer
had
offered
a
bottle
of
rum
to
have
the
mulatto
shot
but
finding
none
that
would
do
it
he
did
it
himself
i
do
not
give
this
as
a
fact
but
i
know
it
was
the
talk
in
camp
though
carefully
kept
from
the
general
as
everybody
knew
it
would
have
given
him
great
pain
he
often
said
he
truly
lamented
the
untimely
death
of
his
nephew
and
that
he
had
been
told
that
this
poor
man
was
his
murderer
but
that
as
a
prisoner
his
life
ought
to
have
been
held
most
sacred
especially
as
the
charge
against
him
was
without
evidence
and
perhaps
no
better
than
conjecture
as
to
my
nephew
continued
he
i
believe
he
was
cruelly
murdered
but
living
virtuously
as
he
did
and
then
dying
fighting
for
the
rights
of
man
he
is
no
doubt
happy
and
this
is
my
comfort
the
next
day
marion
ordered
the
troops
under
arms
and
formed
them
into
a
large
circle
all
fronting
the
centre
while
we
were
wondering
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
strange
manoeuvre
a
sergeant
was
seen
leading
into
the
circle
an
elegant
horse
under
saddle
and
bridle
with
portmanteau
sword
pistols
and
musket
this
was
the
horse
furniture
and
arms
of
captain
lewis
whom
the
lad
gwinn
so
fortunately
for
me
had
killed
in
the
action
three
days
before
marion
then
called
gwinn
from
the
ranks
the
boy
approached
him
with
his
hat
off
the
general
placing
his
hand
upon
his
head
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
squadron
pronounced
him
a
brave
little
man
and
there
pointing
to
the
horse
and
furniture
there
is
the
reward
of
your
gallantry
gwinn
sir
said
i
is
not
a
good
soldier
he
fired
without
orders
that
very
true
replied
he
but
i
am
sure
colonel
you
are
the
last
that
ought
to
blame
me
on
that
account
for
if
i
had
not
fired
and
killed
captain
lewis
exactly
as
i
did
he
would
have
killed
you
and
besides
his
saying
he
was
the
friend
of
george
the
third
was
enough
for
me
i
did
not
think
i
could
fire
too
quick
on
such
a
man
as
that
but
when
the
sergeant
at
the
order
of
marion
led
up
to
him
the
horse
richly
furnitured
as
aforesaid
the
confusion
and
grimace
of
the
lad
were
truly
diverting
he
blushed
he
chuckled
he
looked
around
and
around
upon
his
comrades
as
if
at
a
loss
how
to
contain
himself
or
what
to
do
at
length
he
made
shift
to
reach
out
his
hand
to
the
bridle
though
deeply
blushing
and
said
dear
me
now
well
la
what
will
mammy
think
and
the
children
when
they
come
to
see
me
riding
up
here
on
this
famous
horse
and
all
these
fine
things
i
know
well
enough
how
mammy
will
have
a
hearty
cry
that
what
she
will
for
she
will
think
i
stoled
him
but
if
any
of
the
folks
up
our
way
should
go
to
jaw
about
me
at
that
rate
i
trust
as
how
general
you
will
take
my
part
and
set
straight
marion
smiled
and
commended
him
for
a
good
boy
and
told
him
to
give
his
compliments
to
his
mother
and
also
his
thanks
to
her
for
being
such
a
true
mother
to
her
children
in
bringing
them
up
so
honestly
but
the
general
was
told
the
next
day
that
gwinn
had
said
he
always
hated
the
tories
because
they
would
not
fight
for
their
country
and
since
the
general
had
paid
him
so
well
for
killing
one
of
them
he
was
determined
to
try
if
he
could
not
kill
more
and
he
did
kill
more
too
i
warrant
him
for
he
was
with
us
to
the
end
of
the
war
in
many
a
hard
brush
and
then
he
was
such
a
dead
shot
with
a
rifle
standing
running
or
flying
it
was
all
one
to
gwinn
he
would
make
nothing
at
a
hundred
yards
to
stop
you
a
buck
at
full
tilt
through
the
woods
as
hard
as
he
could
crack
it
and
at
every
clip
to
bring
down
the
squirrels
from
the
tops
of
the
tallest
trees
of
the
forest
chapter
mutiny
in
our
camp
marion
suppresses
it
his
address
to
the
officers
this
war
though
on
our
part
a
war
of
virtue
was
not
always
so
pleasant
as
might
have
been
expected
instances
of
human
weakness
often
occurred
to
disturb
our
harmony
and
fill
good
men
hearts
with
sorrow
for
how
without
grief
could
we
behold
a
man
fighting
by
our
side
like
a
hero
for
the
rights
of
bleeding
humanity
like
a
headstrong
child
or
a
headlong
beast
trampling
them
under
foot
and
oh
how
sad
to
see
nature
goodliest
gifts
of
manly
size
and
strength
and
courage
set
off
too
in
the
proudest
ornaments
of
war
the
fierce
cocked
hat
the
flaming
regimentals
and
golden
all
defeated
of
their
power
to
charm
nay
all
turned
into
pity
and
contempt
in
consequence
of
our
knowing
the
owners
to
be
gamblers
swindlers
and
villains
such
was
the
truly
pitiable
case
of
some
in
this
our
glorious
war
of
liberty
for
want
of
a
good
education
i
mean
the
early
precepts
of
virtue
from
a
parent
lips
with
a
few
excellent
books
to
lift
the
noble
kindlings
of
the
soul
the
flame
could
not
ascend
to
what
was
heavenly
and
just
but
with
inverted
point
struck
downward
to
selfishness
and
vice
men
of
this
character
though
enlisted
in
the
war
of
liberty
were
not
her
soldiers
felt
not
her
enthusiasm
nor
her
consolations
they
did
not
walk
the
camp
glorying
in
themselves
as
men
called
to
the
honor
of
humbling
the
tyrant
and
of
establishing
the
golden
reign
of
equal
laws
in
their
own
dear
country
and
thence
perhaps
over
all
the
earth
alas
no
strangers
to
these
divine
views
and
wishes
they
look
no
higher
than
sordid
gain
and
as
there
was
but
little
of
that
reward
to
be
had
they
were
often
gloomy
and
low
spirited
their
life
they
were
wont
murmuringly
to
say
was
wearing
away
their
country
gave
them
nothing
and
they
must
try
to
do
something
for
themselves
in
truth
plunder
plunder
was
what
they
were
spelling
for
they
were
continually
darting
their
greedy
eyes
upon
every
piece
of
merchandise
that
came
in
their
way
they
had
the
heart
not
only
to
plunder
the
tories
and
to
bring
their
unoffending
children
to
want
but
also
to
rob
and
ruin
their
own
friends
the
whigs
if
they
could
but
do
it
with
impunity
i
am
led
to
these
reflections
by
a
most
shameful
affair
which
happened
in
our
camp
about
this
time
and
which
threatened
consequences
as
serious
as
their
source
was
shameful
we
were
encamped
near
the
house
of
a
rich
man
by
the
name
of
cross
his
wife
in
sense
and
domestic
virtues
was
an
abigail
while
as
to
her
husband
his
riches
though
great
were
his
least
recommendation
for
he
possessed
all
the
generosity
and
honor
of
the
noblest
patriot
his
soul
delighted
in
marion
whom
he
called
the
of
our
cause
oft
as
he
took
leave
of
us
for
battle
his
bosom
would
heave
his
visage
swell
and
the
tear
would
start
into
his
eye
and
when
he
saw
us
return
again
loaded
with
the
spoils
of
victory
he
would
rush
to
meet
us
with
all
a
brother
transports
on
his
face
his
flocks
and
herds
his
and
were
all
our
own
while
his
generous
looks
would
tell
us
that
he
still
wished
for
more
to
give
indeed
often
at
the
most
imminent
risk
of
his
life
he
used
to
send
us
intelligence
and
also
furnish
us
with
powder
and
ball
but
this
most
amiable
of
men
was
not
permitted
to
see
our
cause
triumphant
for
in
the
midst
of
his
sighs
and
tears
for
his
struggling
country
god
took
him
to
his
own
rest
the
messenger
of
death
came
to
him
in
the
character
of
a
nervous
fever
as
the
physicians
did
not
like
to
visit
him
on
his
plantation
he
was
carried
into
georgetown
to
be
near
them
marion
went
to
see
him
the
morning
he
set
out
and
immediately
after
his
departure
fixed
a
guard
at
his
house
that
nothing
might
be
disturbed
one
would
indeed
have
supposed
it
unnecessary
to
place
a
guard
over
such
a
house
as
his
but
alas
what
will
not
a
base
avarice
do
and
i
blush
while
i
relate
that
the
very
day
after
our
generous
friend
was
carried
off
pale
and
to
georgetown
whence
he
never
more
returned
two
of
our
officers
one
of
them
a
major
went
to
his
house
to
pillage
it
the
guard
of
course
opposed
but
they
damned
him
for
an
impertinent
rascal
and
swore
that
if
he
opened
his
mouth
again
they
would
spit
him
on
the
spot
then
bursting
the
door
they
went
in
and
after
forcing
the
desks
drawers
and
trunks
they
rifled
them
of
whatever
they
wanted
this
most
unsoldierly
and
detestable
transaction
was
communicated
to
me
by
cross
herself
whose
servant
came
to
me
next
morning
with
her
compliments
and
requested
that
i
would
go
down
to
her
where
she
was
sitting
in
her
carriage
at
the
road
i
waited
on
her
at
once
and
greatly
to
my
grief
found
her
in
tears
i
entreated
to
know
the
cause
oh
sir
replied
she
we
are
ruined
we
are
ruined
poor
cross
is
i
fear
on
his
deathbed
and
then
what
will
become
of
me
and
my
poor
children
when
he
is
gone
and
every
thing
is
taken
from
us
she
then
reminded
me
of
her
husband
love
to
general
marion
and
his
people
from
whom
he
withheld
nothing
but
gladly
imparted
of
all
he
had
though
often
at
the
risk
of
his
utter
destruction
from
the
british
and
tories
and
yet
after
all
said
she
soon
as
my
poor
sick
husband
back
is
turned
your
people
can
go
and
break
him
up
madam
i
replied
i
hope
is
no
offence
to
ask
your
pardon
for
i
really
can
not
admit
a
suspicion
so
disgraceful
to
our
troop
and
to
my
certain
knowledge
general
marion
placed
a
guard
over
your
house
the
moment
cross
left
it
yes
sir
said
she
that
very
true
and
it
was
like
general
marion
but
some
of
our
officers
have
forced
the
guard
and
broken
open
the
house
and
this
instant
i
saw
one
of
them
with
cross
sword
by
his
side
i
never
felt
more
mortified
in
my
life
then
after
entreating
her
to
be
perfectly
easy
about
her
house
and
furniture
in
future
i
took
leave
of
this
excellent
lady
and
flew
to
the
guard
to
see
if
what
i
had
heard
were
true
he
told
me
it
was
too
true
mentioned
the
names
of
the
officers
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
show
me
one
of
them
strutting
about
with
the
sword
by
his
side
it
was
well
for
the
wretch
that
i
did
not
possess
the
eyes
of
a
basilisk
for
i
should
certainly
have
blasted
him
on
the
spot
pausing
however
one
salutary
moment
to
confirm
myself
in
the
love
of
virtue
by
noting
how
abominable
a
villain
looks
i
hasted
to
the
general
with
the
hateful
tale
which
excited
in
his
honest
bosom
the
indignation
which
i
had
expected
then
calling
one
of
his
aids
he
said
go
to
major
and
desire
him
to
send
me
cross
sword
immediately
the
aid
was
presently
back
but
without
the
sword
on
being
asked
by
the
general
why
he
had
not
brought
it
he
replied
the
major
says
sir
that
the
sword
does
not
belong
to
cross
he
says
moreover
that
if
you
want
the
sword
you
must
go
for
it
yourself
well
go
back
said
the
general
and
desire
those
two
officers
to
come
to
me
it
was
not
for
such
an
affair
as
this
to
be
kept
secret
it
took
wind
in
a
moment
and
by
the
time
the
two
officers
were
arrived
almost
all
the
field
officers
had
come
together
to
the
general
quarters
to
see
how
he
would
act
on
this
extraordinary
occasion
inferring
from
the
looks
of
the
two
culprits
that
they
meant
to
test
his
firmness
and
willing
that
the
company
should
fully
understand
the
merits
of
the
case
he
thus
addressed
us
you
well
know
gentlemen
said
he
how
like
a
brother
the
proprietor
of
this
plantation
has
always
treated
us
we
never
gained
a
victory
but
it
caused
him
tears
of
joy
and
however
starved
by
others
by
him
we
have
ever
been
feasted
you
also
know
that
he
is
now
gone
sick
to
georgetown
there
perhaps
to
die
soon
as
he
left
us
i
placed
a
guard
over
his
house
but
at
the
same
time
blushed
for
the
reflection
cast
on
my
men
all
of
whom
as
i
thought
would
instead
of
robbing
have
defended
it
with
their
lives
but
equally
to
my
astonishment
and
grief
i
find
i
was
mistaken
yes
gentlemen
our
friend
has
been
robbed
not
by
the
poor
untutored
privates
in
the
ranks
but
by
my
officers
by
those
who
ought
to
have
abhorred
such
an
act
yes
gentlemen
two
of
our
brethren
in
arms
two
of
our
officers
forgetting
what
they
owed
to
you
what
they
owed
to
me
and
most
of
all
to
their
country
and
to
themselves
have
done
this
odious
deed
and
one
of
them
here
he
pointed
to
the
major
now
wears
by
his
side
the
sword
of
our
sick
and
injured
friend
well
knowing
that
all
men
even
the
best
have
too
often
those
things
which
they
ought
not
to
have
done
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
be
as
tender
with
this
gentleman
as
possible
and
therefore
sent
him
a
polite
request
that
he
would
return
the
sword
to
which
he
was
pleased
to
reply
that
i
wanted
it
i
must
come
and
take
it
myself
still
wishing
to
settle
the
affair
in
a
way
as
much
to
his
credit
as
possible
i
sent
for
him
to
come
to
me
and
now
sir
addressing
the
major
i
entreat
of
you
for
the
last
time
to
give
me
up
that
sword
with
great
rudeness
he
swore
he
would
not
instantly
every
face
was
dark
and
biting
his
lip
with
rage
each
officer
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
and
looked
to
the
general
one
word
nay
one
assenting
look
and
the
brute
would
have
been
hewed
into
mincemeat
in
a
moment
for
my
own
part
whether
i
felt
more
or
governed
myself
less
than
the
rest
i
can
not
say
but
looking
to
the
general
i
broke
out
with
an
oath
that
if
i
commanded
as
he
did
i
would
have
that
fellow
hung
in
five
minutes
this
is
no
business
of
yours
sir
replied
he
rather
sternly
they
are
now
before
me
then
looking
at
the
major
still
with
great
benignity
he
said
and
do
you
really
mean
sir
not
to
give
me
up
that
sword
sir
i
will
not
replied
the
major
sergeant
of
the
guard
said
the
general
bring
me
instantly
a
file
of
soldiers
upon
this
the
major
colleague
who
stood
by
was
seen
to
touch
him
seeing
the
guard
coming
up
with
their
naked
weapons
and
much
anger
in
their
looks
the
major
lost
his
courage
turned
pale
and
in
a
sadly
altered
tone
whined
out
general
you
needed
not
to
have
called
in
the
guard
i
will
deliver
up
the
sword
here
it
is
no
sir
i
will
not
accept
it
at
your
hands
give
it
to
the
sergeant
to
this
humiliating
order
with
much
shame
and
blushing
the
poor
major
was
constrained
to
comply
thus
happily
were
extinguished
the
first
sparks
of
a
mutiny
which
it
was
once
thought
would
have
broken
out
into
a
dangerous
flame
the
cool
dispassionate
address
which
effected
this
did
not
fail
to
produce
a
proper
impression
on
us
all
this
the
general
easily
perceived
in
our
looks
and
thereupon
as
was
common
with
him
when
any
such
occasion
served
he
arose
and
addressed
us
in
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
the
following
words
when
gentlemen
shall
we
catch
the
spirit
of
our
profession
the
spirit
of
men
fighting
for
a
republic
a
commonwealth
of
brothers
that
government
most
glorious
where
god
alone
is
king
that
government
most
pleasant
where
men
make
and
obey
their
own
laws
and
that
government
most
prosperous
where
men
reaping
as
they
sow
feel
the
utmost
stimulus
to
every
virtue
that
can
exalt
the
human
character
and
condition
this
government
the
glory
of
the
earth
has
ever
been
the
desire
of
the
wise
and
good
of
all
nations
for
this
the
platos
of
greece
the
catos
of
rome
the
tells
of
switzerland
the
sidneys
of
england
and
the
washingtons
of
america
have
sighed
and
reasoned
have
fought
and
died
in
this
grand
army
gentlemen
we
are
now
enlisted
and
are
combatting
under
the
same
banners
with
those
excellent
men
of
the
earth
then
let
gladden
our
every
heart
and
swell
each
nerve
with
such
worthies
by
our
sides
with
such
a
cause
before
our
eyes
let
us
move
on
with
joy
to
the
battle
and
charge
like
the
honored
champions
of
god
and
of
human
rights
but
in
the
moment
of
victory
let
the
supplicating
enemy
find
us
as
lovely
in
mercy
as
we
are
terrible
in
valor
our
enemies
are
blind
they
neither
understand
nor
desire
the
happiness
of
mankind
ignorant
therefore
as
children
they
claim
our
pity
for
themselves
and
as
to
their
widows
and
little
ones
the
very
thought
of
them
should
fill
our
souls
with
tenderness
the
crib
that
contains
their
corn
the
cow
that
gives
them
milk
the
cabin
that
shelters
their
feeble
heads
from
the
storm
should
be
sacred
in
our
eyes
weak
and
helpless
as
they
are
still
they
are
the
nurslings
of
heaven
our
best
intercessors
with
the
almighty
let
them
but
give
us
their
blessings
and
i
care
not
how
much
the
british
curse
let
their
prayers
ascend
up
before
god
in
our
behalf
and
cornwallis
and
tarleton
shall
yet
flee
before
us
like
frightened
wolves
before
the
well
armed
shepherds
such
were
the
words
of
marion
in
the
day
when
he
saw
in
our
looks
that
our
hearts
were
prepared
for
instruction
and
such
was
the
epilogue
to
the
mutiny
the
satisfaction
which
it
gave
to
the
officers
was
so
general
and
sincere
that
i
often
heard
them
say
afterwards
that
since
the
mutiny
was
suppressed
they
were
glad
it
happened
for
it
had
given
them
an
opportunity
to
hear
a
lecture
which
they
hoped
would
make
them
better
men
and
braver
soldiers
too
as
long
as
they
lived
about
this
time
we
received
a
flag
from
the
enemy
in
georgetown
the
object
of
which
was
to
make
some
arrangements
about
the
exchange
of
prisoners
the
flag
after
the
usual
ceremony
of
blindfolding
was
conducted
into
marion
encampment
having
heard
great
talk
about
general
marion
his
fancy
had
naturally
enough
sketched
out
for
him
some
stout
figure
of
a
warrior
such
as
or
cornwallis
himself
of
martial
aspect
and
flaming
regimentals
but
what
was
his
surprise
when
led
into
marion
presence
and
the
bandage
taken
from
his
eyes
he
beheld
in
our
hero
a
swarthy
little
man
with
scarce
enough
of
threadbare
homespun
to
cover
his
nakedness
and
in
place
of
tall
ranks
of
gaily
dressed
soldiers
a
handful
of
sunburnt
some
roasting
potatoes
and
some
asleep
with
their
black
firelocks
and
lying
by
them
on
the
logs
having
recovered
a
little
from
his
surprise
he
presented
his
letter
to
general
marion
who
perused
it
and
soon
settled
everything
to
his
satisfaction
the
officer
took
up
his
hat
to
retire
oh
no
said
marion
it
is
now
about
our
time
of
dining
and
i
hope
sir
you
will
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
to
dinner
at
mention
of
the
word
the
british
officer
looked
around
him
but
to
his
great
mortification
could
see
no
sign
of
a
pot
pan
or
any
other
cooking
utensil
that
could
raise
the
spirits
of
a
hungry
man
well
tom
said
the
general
to
one
of
his
men
come
give
us
our
dinner
the
dinner
to
which
he
alluded
was
no
other
than
a
heap
of
sweet
potatoes
that
were
very
snugly
roasting
under
the
embers
and
which
tom
with
his
pine
stick
poker
soon
liberated
from
their
ashy
confinement
pinching
them
every
now
and
then
with
his
fingers
especially
the
big
ones
to
see
whether
they
were
well
done
or
not
then
having
cleansed
them
of
the
ashes
partly
by
blowing
them
with
his
breath
and
partly
by
brushing
them
with
the
sleeve
of
his
old
cotton
shirt
he
piled
some
of
the
best
on
a
large
piece
of
bark
and
placed
them
between
the
british
officer
and
marion
on
the
trunk
of
the
fallen
pine
on
which
they
sat
i
fear
sir
said
the
general
our
dinner
will
not
prove
so
palatable
to
you
as
i
could
wish
but
it
is
the
best
we
have
the
officer
who
was
a
well
bred
man
took
up
one
of
the
potatoes
and
affected
to
feed
as
if
he
had
found
a
great
dainty
but
it
was
very
plain
that
he
ate
more
from
good
manners
than
good
appetite
presently
he
broke
out
into
a
hearty
laugh
marion
looked
surprised
i
beg
pardon
general
said
he
but
one
can
not
you
know
always
command
his
conceits
i
was
thinking
how
drolly
some
of
my
brother
officers
would
look
if
our
government
were
to
give
them
such
a
bill
of
fare
as
this
i
suppose
replied
marion
it
is
not
equal
to
their
style
of
dining
no
indeed
quoth
the
officer
and
this
i
imagine
is
one
of
your
accidental
lent
dinners
a
sort
of
a
yan
in
general
no
doubt
you
live
a
great
deal
better
rather
worse
answered
the
general
for
often
we
do
get
enough
of
this
heavens
rejoined
the
officer
but
probably
what
you
lose
in
meal
you
make
up
in
malt
though
stinted
in
provisions
you
draw
noble
pay
not
a
cent
sir
said
marion
not
a
cent
heavens
and
earth
then
you
must
be
in
a
bad
box
i
do
see
general
how
you
can
stand
it
why
sir
replied
marion
with
a
smile
of
these
things
depend
on
feeling
the
englishman
said
he
did
not
believe
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
reconcile
his
feelings
to
a
soldier
life
on
general
marion
terms
all
fighting
and
no
pay
and
no
provisions
but
potatoes
why
sir
answered
the
general
the
heart
is
all
and
when
that
is
much
interested
a
man
can
do
any
thing
many
a
youth
would
think
it
hard
to
indent
himself
a
slave
for
fourteen
years
but
let
him
be
over
head
and
ears
in
love
and
with
such
a
beauteous
sweetheart
as
rachael
and
he
will
think
no
more
of
fourteen
years
servitude
than
young
jacob
did
well
now
this
is
exactly
my
case
i
am
in
love
and
my
sweetheart
is
liberty
be
that
heavenly
nymph
my
companion
and
these
wilds
and
woods
shall
have
charms
beyond
london
and
paris
in
slavery
to
have
no
proud
monarch
driving
over
me
with
his
gilt
coaches
nor
his
host
of
and
insulting
and
robbing
me
but
to
be
my
own
master
my
own
prince
and
sovereign
gloriously
preserving
my
national
dignity
and
pursuing
my
true
happiness
planting
my
vineyards
and
eating
their
luscious
fruits
and
sowing
my
fields
and
reaping
the
golden
grain
and
seeing
millions
of
brothers
all
around
me
equally
free
and
happy
as
myself
this
sir
is
what
i
long
for
the
officer
replied
that
both
as
a
man
and
a
briton
he
must
certainly
subscribe
to
this
as
a
happy
state
of
things
happy
quoth
marion
yes
happy
indeed
and
i
had
rather
fight
for
such
blessings
for
my
country
and
feed
on
roots
than
keep
aloof
though
wallowing
in
all
the
luxuries
of
solomon
for
now
sir
i
walk
the
soil
that
gave
me
birth
and
exult
in
the
thought
that
i
am
not
unworthy
of
it
i
look
upon
these
venerable
trees
around
me
and
feel
that
i
do
not
dishonor
them
i
think
of
my
own
sacred
rights
and
rejoice
that
i
have
not
basely
deserted
them
and
when
i
look
forward
to
the
long
ages
of
posterity
i
glory
in
the
thought
that
i
am
fighting
their
battles
the
children
of
distant
generations
may
never
hear
my
name
but
still
it
gladdens
my
heart
to
think
that
i
am
now
contending
for
their
freedom
and
all
its
countless
blessings
i
looked
at
marion
as
he
uttered
these
sentiments
and
fancied
i
felt
as
when
i
heard
the
last
words
of
the
brave
de
kalb
the
englishman
hung
his
honest
head
and
looked
i
thought
as
if
he
had
seen
the
upbraiding
ghosts
of
his
illustrious
countrymen
sidney
and
hampden
on
his
return
to
georgetown
he
was
asked
by
colonel
watson
why
he
looked
so
serious
i
have
cause
sir
said
he
to
look
serious
what
has
general
marion
refused
to
treat
no
sir
well
then
has
old
washington
defeated
sir
henry
clinton
and
broke
up
our
army
no
sir
not
that
neither
but
worse
ah
what
can
be
worse
why
sir
i
have
seen
an
american
general
and
his
officers
without
pay
and
almost
without
clothes
living
on
roots
and
drinking
water
and
all
for
liberty
what
chance
have
we
against
such
men
it
is
said
colonel
watson
was
not
much
obliged
to
him
for
this
speech
but
the
young
officer
was
so
struck
with
marion
sentiments
that
he
never
rested
until
he
threw
up
his
commission
and
retired
from
the
service
chapter
ah
brandy
brandy
bane
of
life
spring
of
tumult
source
of
strife
could
i
but
half
thy
curses
tell
the
wise
would
wish
thee
safe
at
hell
curious
and
instructive
anecdotes
that
great
poet
john
milton
who
seems
to
have
known
him
well
assures
us
that
the
devil
was
the
inventor
of
gunpowder
but
for
my
own
part
were
i
in
the
humor
to
ascribe
any
particular
invention
to
the
author
of
all
evil
it
should
be
that
of
distilling
we
have
scripture
for
it
that
he
began
his
capers
with
the
apple
then
why
not
go
on
with
the
brandy
which
is
but
the
fiery
juice
of
the
apple
at
any
rate
i
am
pretty
sure
i
shall
hardly
ever
be
able
to
think
of
it
again
with
tolerable
patience
as
long
as
i
live
for
it
was
that
vile
filthy
poison
that
cut
me
out
of
one
of
the
finest
plumes
that
i
ever
expected
to
feather
my
cap
with
the
case
stands
briefly
thus
i
have
told
the
reader
that
marion
surprised
and
captured
the
celebrated
tory
partisan
colonel
tynes
after
killing
the
major
part
of
his
men
for
safe
keeping
he
was
sent
into
north
carolina
whence
he
made
his
escape
got
back
into
the
forests
of
black
river
and
collected
a
stout
force
to
try
his
fortune
a
second
time
with
marion
but
getting
knowledge
of
the
thing
marion
made
one
of
his
forced
marches
fell
upon
him
unawares
and
broke
him
up
worse
than
before
killing
and
taking
his
whole
party
tynes
was
sent
again
to
north
carolina
whence
he
contrived
again
to
make
his
escape
and
returning
to
his
old
haunts
soon
rallied
a
formidable
force
for
a
third
trial
this
news
was
soon
brought
to
general
marion
who
thereupon
desired
me
to
take
forty
of
our
best
cavaliers
and
see
if
we
could
not
scourge
colonel
tynes
once
more
about
sunset
we
mounted
and
travelled
hard
all
that
night
and
until
the
middle
of
next
day
when
we
halted
for
refreshment
at
the
house
of
one
who
was
truly
a
publican
and
sinner
for
he
was
a
great
tory
not
knowing
what
secret
intelligence
the
man
might
convey
to
the
enemy
who
were
but
fifteen
miles
off
i
had
him
taken
up
and
put
under
guard
we
then
got
dinner
for
which
we
honorably
paid
the
poor
woman
his
wife
and
now
comes
my
woeful
story
while
after
dinner
i
was
busily
employed
in
catechising
my
prisoner
how
should
the
devil
be
employed
but
in
tempting
my
men
with
the
distilled
juice
of
the
apple
having
by
some
ill
luck
found
out
that
there
was
a
barrel
of
it
in
the
house
they
hastened
to
the
poor
landlady
who
not
only
gave
them
a
full
dose
for
the
present
but
filled
their
bottles
and
canteens
as
we
pushed
on
after
dinner
in
high
spirits
for
the
enemy
i
could
not
but
remark
how
constantly
the
men
were
turning
up
their
canteens
what
the
plague
have
you
got
there
boys
said
i
that
you
are
so
eternally
drinking
water
sir
water
nothing
but
water
the
rogues
were
drinking
brandy
all
the
time
but
by
way
of
whipping
the
devil
round
the
stump
they
called
it
that
is
water
presently
finding
from
their
gaiety
and
frolicksomeness
what
they
had
been
after
i
ordered
a
halt
and
set
myself
to
harangue
them
for
such
unsoldierly
conduct
but
i
might
as
well
have
talked
to
a
troop
of
drunken
yahoos
for
some
of
them
grinned
in
my
face
like
monkeys
others
looked
as
stupid
as
asses
while
the
greater
part
chattered
like
magpies
each
boasted
what
a
clever
fellow
he
was
and
what
mighty
things
he
could
do
yet
reeling
all
the
time
and
scarcely
able
to
sit
his
horse
indeed
our
guide
a
fat
fellow
fetching
one
of
his
heavy
lee
lurches
got
so
far
beyond
his
perpendicular
that
he
could
not
right
again
but
fell
off
and
came
to
the
ground
as
helpless
as
a
miller
bag
in
short
among
my
whole
corps
there
was
but
one
sober
man
and
that
was
captain
neilson
it
is
not
for
language
to
express
one
thousandth
part
of
my
mortification
and
rage
to
have
made
such
an
extraordinary
march
and
at
the
head
of
such
choice
fellows
too
to
have
come
almost
within
sight
of
the
enemy
an
enemy
that
i
was
eager
to
humble
and
which
would
have
yielded
me
so
complete
and
glorious
a
victory
and
yet
to
have
lost
all
so
shamefully
and
thus
like
a
fool
to
be
sent
back
to
my
general
with
my
finger
in
my
mouth
was
indeed
almost
beyond
endurance
but
i
was
obliged
to
endure
it
for
to
have
led
my
men
into
action
in
that
condition
would
have
been
no
better
than
murdering
them
and
to
have
kept
them
there
until
they
could
have
cooled
off
was
utterly
out
of
the
question
for
there
was
not
a
family
in
that
whole
district
that
would
with
their
good
will
have
given
us
an
hour
repose
or
a
morsel
of
bread
i
therefore
instantly
ordered
a
retreat
which
was
made
with
all
the
noise
and
irregularity
that
might
have
been
expected
from
a
troop
of
drunkards
each
of
whom
mistaking
himself
for
commander
in
chief
gave
orders
according
to
his
own
mad
humor
and
whooped
and
halloed
at
such
a
rate
that
i
verily
believed
no
ever
made
half
the
racket
that
we
should
have
obtained
a
most
complete
victory
is
very
certain
for
in
a
few
days
after
this
we
laid
hands
upon
some
of
those
very
same
tories
who
stated
that
in
consequence
of
the
noise
which
we
made
that
night
colonel
tynes
despatched
some
of
his
cavalry
up
the
road
next
morning
to
see
what
was
the
matter
on
coming
to
the
spot
where
i
had
vainly
endeavored
to
form
my
drunken
dogs
they
found
on
the
ground
some
of
our
plumes
which
colonel
tynes
no
sooner
saw
than
he
bawled
out
marion
marion
then
leaping
on
their
horses
off
they
went
whip
and
spur
well
where
is
colonel
tynes
said
the
general
as
i
entered
his
presence
this
was
the
question
which
i
had
expected
and
indeed
blushed
for
the
answer
but
after
hearing
my
doleful
story
he
replied
with
his
usual
philosophy
well
you
did
right
to
retreat
but
pray
keep
a
careful
eye
on
the
apple
water
next
time
but
to
give
the
devil
his
due
i
must
confess
there
was
one
instance
in
which
i
thought
some
good
was
done
by
brandy
this
was
in
the
case
of
captain
snipes
and
his
command
which
by
way
of
farce
to
my
own
tragedy
i
beg
leave
to
relate
hearing
of
a
tory
not
far
distant
marion
despatched
the
brave
captain
snipes
with
a
party
to
chastise
them
they
had
scarcely
got
upon
the
tory
before
at
a
short
turn
in
the
road
they
came
full
butt
upon
a
large
body
of
horsemen
supposing
them
to
be
tories
snipes
instantly
gave
the
word
to
charge
himself
leading
the
way
with
his
usual
impetuosity
the
supposed
tories
wheeling
about
took
to
the
sands
and
went
off
as
hard
as
their
horses
could
stave
and
thus
crack
and
crack
they
had
it
for
about
two
miles
finding
that
snipes
was
gaining
upon
them
the
runagates
began
to
lighten
themselves
of
every
thing
they
could
spare
and
the
road
was
presently
strewed
with
blankets
and
knapsacks
one
of
them
it
seems
carried
a
five
gallon
keg
of
brandy
which
he
could
not
think
of
parting
with
and
being
well
mounted
he
stood
a
good
pull
for
the
two
first
miles
but
finding
he
was
dropping
astern
very
fast
he
slyly
cut
the
straps
of
his
mail
pillion
and
so
let
his
keg
brandy
and
all
go
by
the
run
over
his
horse
rump
captain
snipes
who
led
the
chase
found
no
difficulty
in
passing
the
keg
but
his
men
coming
up
instantly
broached
to
all
standing
for
they
could
no
more
pass
by
a
keg
of
brandy
than
young
monkeys
could
pass
a
basket
of
apples
snipes
cursed
and
raved
like
a
madman
but
all
in
vain
for
they
swore
they
must
have
a
dram
while
they
were
devising
ways
and
means
how
to
get
into
the
keg
the
supposed
tories
now
a
good
distance
ahead
came
to
a
halt
and
their
captain
fortunately
reflecting
that
their
pursuers
might
not
be
enemies
sent
back
a
flag
the
result
was
the
very
joyful
discovery
that
the
owners
of
the
keg
were
good
whigs
coming
to
join
general
marion
thus
to
a
moral
certainty
this
keg
of
brandy
was
made
of
kind
heaven
the
happy
means
of
preventing
much
bloodshed
that
day
having
given
two
cases
of
brandy
the
one
good
the
other
bad
i
will
now
give
a
third
which
the
reader
if
he
pleases
may
call
indifferent
and
which
runs
as
follows
general
marion
still
encamped
in
the
neighborhood
of
georgetown
ordered
captain
withers
to
take
sergeant
macdonald
with
four
volunteers
and
go
on
the
enemy
lines
to
see
what
they
were
doing
on
approaching
the
town
they
met
an
old
tory
one
of
your
fellows
whom
neither
side
regarded
any
more
than
a
jew
does
a
pig
and
therefore
suffered
him
to
stroll
when
and
where
he
pleased
the
old
man
knew
captain
withers
very
well
and
as
soon
as
he
had
got
near
enough
to
recollect
him
he
bawled
out
god
mercy
master
withers
why
where
are
you
going
this
course
going
old
daddy
why
to
the
devil
perhaps
replied
withers
well
faith
that
like
enough
captain
said
the
old
man
especially
if
you
keep
on
this
tack
much
longer
but
before
you
go
any
further
suppose
you
take
a
pull
with
me
of
this
holding
up
a
stout
tickler
of
brandy
mayhap
you
may
not
get
such
good
liquor
where
you
are
going
with
all
my
heart
daddy
answered
withers
and
twigg
the
tickler
to
the
tune
of
a
deep
dram
and
passed
it
on
to
macdonald
who
also
twigg
it
and
tom
twigg
it
and
dick
twigg
it
and
harry
twigg
it
and
so
they
all
twigg
it
in
the
mean
time
the
chat
went
round
very
briskly
and
dram
after
dram
the
brandy
until
the
tickler
was
drained
to
the
bottom
and
then
the
subtle
spirit
of
the
brandy
ascending
into
their
noddles
worked
such
wonders
that
they
all
began
to
feel
themselves
as
big
as
field
officers
macdonald
for
his
part
with
a
face
as
red
as
a
comet
reined
up
selim
and
drawing
his
claymore
began
to
pitch
and
prance
about
cutting
and
slashing
the
empty
air
as
if
he
had
a
score
of
enemies
before
him
and
ever
and
anon
roaring
out
huzza
boys
damme
let
charge
charge
boys
charge
cried
all
the
rest
reining
up
their
horses
and
flourishing
their
swords
where
the
plague
are
you
going
to
charge
asked
the
old
tory
why
into
georgetown
right
off
replied
they
well
you
had
better
have
a
care
boys
how
you
charge
there
for
i
be
blamed
if
you
do
not
get
yourselves
into
business
pretty
quick
for
the
town
is
chock
full
of
red
coats
red
coats
one
and
all
they
roared
out
red
coats
egad
that
just
what
we
want
charge
boys
charge
huzza
for
the
red
coats
damme
then
clapping
spurs
to
their
steeds
off
went
these
six
young
huzzaing
and
flourishing
their
swords
and
charging
at
full
tilt
into
a
british
garrison
town
of
three
hundred
men
the
enemy
supposing
that
this
was
only
our
advance
and
that
general
marion
with
his
whole
force
would
presently
be
upon
them
flew
with
all
speed
to
their
redoubt
and
there
lay
as
snug
as
fleas
in
a
but
all
of
them
were
not
quite
so
lucky
for
several
were
overtaken
and
cut
down
in
the
streets
among
whom
was
a
sergeant
major
a
stout
greasy
fellow
who
strove
hard
to
waddle
away
with
his
bacon
but
selim
was
too
quick
for
him
and
macdonald
with
a
stroke
of
his
claymore
sent
his
frightened
ghost
to
join
the
majority
having
thus
cleared
the
streets
our
young
troopers
then
called
at
the
houses
of
their
friends
asked
the
news
and
drank
their
grog
with
great
unconcern
the
british
after
having
for
some
time
vainly
looked
for
marion
began
to
smell
the
trick
and
in
great
wrath
sallied
forth
for
vengeance
our
adventurers
then
in
turn
were
fain
to
scamper
off
as
fast
as
they
had
made
the
others
before
but
with
better
success
for
though
hundreds
of
muskets
were
fired
after
them
they
got
clear
without
receiving
a
scratch
but
nothing
ever
so
mortified
the
british
as
did
this
mad
frolic
that
half
a
dozen
d
young
rebels
they
said
should
thus
dash
in
among
us
in
open
daylight
and
fall
to
cutting
and
slashing
the
king
troops
at
this
rate
and
after
all
to
gallop
away
without
the
least
harm
in
hair
or
hide
is
high
time
to
turn
our
bayonets
into
pitch
forks
and
go
to
foddering
the
cows
chapter
history
of
captain
snipes
wanton
destruction
of
his
property
by
the
tories
his
own
miraculous
escape
admirable
fidelity
of
his
negro
driver
cudjo
captain
snipes
who
made
such
a
figure
in
the
wars
of
marion
was
a
carolinian
of
uncommon
strength
and
courage
both
of
which
he
exerted
with
great
good
will
against
the
british
and
tories
from
principle
partly
and
partly
from
revenge
but
though
a
choice
soldier
he
was
no
philosopher
he
did
not
consider
that
to
fight
for
duty
people
must
love
it
that
to
love
it
they
must
understand
it
that
to
understand
it
they
must
possess
letters
and
religion
that
the
british
and
tories
poor
fellows
possessing
neither
of
these
were
not
to
have
been
expected
to
act
any
other
than
the
savage
and
thievish
part
they
did
act
and
therefore
no
more
to
be
hated
for
it
than
the
cats
are
for
teasing
the
canary
birds
but
captain
snipes
had
no
turn
for
investigations
of
this
sort
knowledge
by
intuition
was
all
that
he
cared
for
and
having
it
by
instinct
that
an
englishman
ought
never
to
fight
against
liberty
nor
an
american
against
his
own
country
he
looked
on
them
to
use
his
own
phrase
as
a
pack
of
d
rascals
whom
it
was
doing
god
service
to
kill
wherever
he
could
find
them
but
snipes
was
not
the
aggressor
he
kept
in
very
decently
till
the
enemy
began
to
let
out
as
they
did
in
plundering
burning
and
hanging
the
poor
whigs
and
then
indeed
like
a
consuming
fire
his
smothered
hate
broke
forth
that
hate
which
hurled
to
pluto
gloomy
reign
the
souls
of
royal
slaves
untimely
slain
afraid
in
fair
fight
to
meet
that
sword
which
had
so
often
shivered
their
friends
they
determined
to
take
him
as
the
philistines
did
samson
by
surprise
and
having
learned
from
their
spies
that
he
was
at
home
they
came
upon
him
in
force
about
midnight
his
complete
destruction
both
of
life
and
property
was
their
horrid
aim
happily
his
driver
or

within

of

a
clump
of

so
thick
set
that
one
would
have
thought
a
frightened
cat
would
scarcely
have
squeezed
herself
into
it
from
the
hot
pursuing
dogs
but
what
will
not
fear
enable
a
man
to
do
captain
snipes
big
as
he
was
slipped
into
it
with
the
facility
of
a
weasel
through
the
chinks
of
a
but
lost
every
thread
and
thrumb
of
his
shirt
and
moreover
got
his
hide
so
scratched
and
torn
by
the
briers
that
the
blood
trickled
from
him
fast
as
gravy
from
a
fat
green
goose
scarcely
had
he
gained
his
before
the
tories
with
horrid
oaths
burst
into
his
house
with
their
guns
cocked
ready
to
shoot
him
but
oh
death
to
their
hopes
he
was
gone
the
nest
was
there
and
warm
but
the
bird
was
flown
then
seizing
poor
cudjo
by
the
throat
they
bawled
out
you
d
d
rascal
where
your
master
he
told
them
he
did
not
know
you
lie
you
black
son
of
a
you
lie
but
he
still
asserted
he
knew
nothing
of
his
master
suspecting
that
he
must
be
in
some
one
or
other
of
his
buildings
they
set
fire
to
them
all
to
his
dwelling
house
his
kitchen
his
stables
and
even
his
negro
cabins
watching
all
the
while
with
their
muskets
ready
to
shoot
him
as
he
ran
out
from
their
nearness
to
his
lurking
place
the
heat
of
his
burning
houses
was
so
intense
as
to
parch
his
skin
into
blisters
but
it
was
death
to
stir
for
he
would
certainly
have
been
seen
not
having
made
the
discovery
they
so
much
wished
they
again
seized
cudjo
and
with
their
cocked
pieces
at
his
breast
swore
if
he
did
not
instantly
tell
them
where
his
master
was
they
would
put
him
to
death
he
still
declared
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
then
they
clapped
a
halter
round
his
neck
and
told
him
to
down
on
his
knees
and
say
his
prayers
at
once
for
he
had
but
two
minutes
to
live
he
replied
that
he
did
not
want
to
say
his
prayers
now
for
that
he
was
no
thief
and
had
always
been
a
true
slave
to
his
master
this
fine
sentiment
of
the
poor
black
was
entirely
lost
on
our
malignant
whites
who
throwing
the
end
of
the
halter
over
the
limb
of
an
oak
tucked
him
up
as
though
he
had
been
a
mad
dog
he
hung
till
he
was
nearly
dead
when
one
of
them
called
out
d
n
him
cut
him
down
i
be
bound
he
tell
us
now
cudjo
was
accordingly
cut
down
and
as
soon
as
a
little
recovered
questioned
again
about
his
master
but
he
still
declared
he
knew
nothing
of
him
he
was
then
hoisted
a
second
time
and
a
second
time
when
nearly
dead
cut
down
and
questioned
as
before
but
still
asserted
his
ignorance
the
same
inhuman
part
was
acted
on
him
a
third
time
but
with
no
better
success
for
the
brave
fellow
still
continued
faithful
to
his
master
who
squatted
and
trembled
in
his
place
of
torment
his
brier
bush
and
saw
and
heard
all
that
was
passing
persuaded
now
that
cudjo
really
knew
nothing
of
his
master
they
gave
up
the
shameful
contest
and
went
off
leaving
him
half
dead
on
the
ground
but
covered
with
glory
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive
a
situation
more
severely
torturing
than
this
of
captain
snipes
his
house
with
all
his
furniture
his
kitchen
his
barn
and
his
stables
with
several
fine
horses
and
his
negro
houses
all
wrapped
in
flames
himself
scorched
and
blistered
with
the
furious
heat
yet
not
daring
to
stir
his
retreat
well
known
to
a
poor
slave
and
that
slave
alone
in
the
hands
of
an
enraged
banditti
with
their
muskets
at
his
breast
imprecating
the
most
horrid
curses
on
themselves
if
they
did
not
instantly
murder
him
unless
he
disclosed
the
secret
what
had
he
to
expect
of
this
poor
slave
but
that
he
would
sink
under
the
dreadful
trial
and
to
save
himself
would
sacrifice
his
master
but
snipes
was
safe
to
discover
his
death
stared
his
slave
in
the
face
but
happily
his
slave
possessed
for
him
that
love
which
is
stronger
than
death
captain
snipes
and
his
man
cudjo
had
been
brought
up
from
childhood
together
and
the
father
of
our
hero
being
a
professor
of
christianity
a
baptist
preacher
whose
main
excellence
is
to
teach
little
children
to
love
one
another
had
taken
great
pains
to
inspire
his
son
with
love
towards
his
little
slave
nor
did
that
love
pass
unrequited
for
cudjo
used
every
day
to
follow
his
young
master
to
school
carrying
his
basket
for
him
prattling
as
he
went
and
smiling
would
remind
him
of
the
coming
saturday
and
what
fine
fishing
and
hunting
they
would
have
that
day
many
a
time
had
they
wrestled
and
slept
side
by
side
on
the
green
and
thence
springing
up
again
with
renovated
strength
set
out
in
full
march
for
some
favorite
fruit
tree
or
some
cooling
pond
there
to
swim
and
gambol
in
the
refreshing
flood
and
when
the
time
of
dinner
came
cudjo
was
not
scornfully
left
to
sigh
and
to
gnaw
his
nails
alone
but
would
play
and
sing
about
the
door
till
his
young
master
was
done
and
then
he
was
sure
to
receive
a
good
plate
full
for
himself
love
thus
early
ingrafted
on
his
heart
grew
up
with
daily
increasing
strength
to
manhood
when
snipes
by
the
death
of
his
father
became
master
of
the
estate
made
cudjo
his
driver
or
overseer
and
thus
rivetted
on
his
honest
bosom
that
sacred
friendship
which
as
we
have
seen
enabled
him
to
triumph
in
one
of
the
severest
trials
that
human
nature
was
ever
put
to
the
above
is
a
solemn
fact
and
the
wise
will
lay
it
to
heart
chapter
marion
pursues
major
muckleworth
fine
anecdote
of
the
major
marion
generosity
to
him
learning
that
a
detachment
of
the
british
were
marching
up
black
river
towards
statesburgh
and
camden
general
marion
gave
orders
to
chase
which
was
conducted
as
usual
with
such
rapidity
that
about
sunset
of
the
second
day
we
came
up
with
them
our
advance
composed
of
choice
fellows
instantly
began
to
skirmish
with
the
enemy
of
whom
they
killed
eight
or
nine
a
few
on
both
sides
rather
badly
wounded
were
made
prisoners
marion
coming
up
gave
orders
to
call
off
the
troops
meaning
to
give
the
enemy
a
serious
brush
in
the
morning
but
of
this
gratification
they
entirely
disappointed
us
by
striking
their
tents
and
pushing
off
in
silence
before
day
soon
as
light
returned
and
the
retreat
of
the
british
was
announced
we
renewed
the
pursuit
and
by
late
reached
the
house
at
which
the
enemy
had
refreshed
themselves
this
house
belonged
to
a
poor
but
excellent
old
lady
well
known
to
marion
the
general
was
hardly
alighted
from
his
horse
before
the
old
lady
had
him
by
the
hand
declaring
how
happy
she
had
always
been
to
see
him
but
now
continued
she
if
i
a
right
down
sorry
to
see
you
then
i
be
hanged
marion
with
a
look
of
surprise
asked
her
why
she
was
sorry
to
see
him
now
oh
do
i
know
you
too
well
general
do
i
know
that
old
scratch
himself
ca
keep
you
from
fighting
and
now
you
are
hurrying
along
here
with
all
your
men
only
to
fight
the
british
a
it
so
now
general
marion
told
her
that
that
was
indeed
his
business
well
dear
me
now
and
did
i
not
tell
you
so
but
pray
now
my
dear
general
marion
let
me
beg
of
you
do
you
do
any
harm
to
that
dear
good
man
that
major
muckleworth
who
went
from
here
a
little
while
ago
for
o
he
the
englishman
i
ever
saw
in
all
my
born
days
as
to
that
rawdon
and
tarleton
god
curse
upon
the
thieves
and
blackguards
i
would
not
care
if
you
could
kill
a
thousand
of
them
but
that
good
major
muckleworth
indeed
indeed
now
general
you
must
not
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
for
it
would
be
such
a
crying
sin
simms
gives
this
name
as
mcilraith
and
james
as
but
in
this
one
case
weems
corruption
of
the
name
which
colloquially
means
much
worth
is
more
satisfying
marion
asked
her
in
what
respects
was
he
better
than
other
british
officers
better
than
other
british
officers
replied
the
old
lady
lord
bless
your
dear
soul
general
marion
well
come
along
come
along
with
me
and
i
let
you
see
we
followed
the
old
lady
who
tripping
along
nimble
as
a
girl
conducted
us
into
a
clean
looking
cabin
wherein
sat
a
man
very
genteelly
dressed
and
several
wounded
persons
lying
before
him
on
pallets
on
the
floor
marion
saluted
the
stranger
who
informed
us
that
he
was
a
surgeon
in
the
service
of
his
britannic
majesty
and
left
by
major
muckleworth
to
take
care
of
the
wounded
of
whom
sir
i
believe
that
nearly
one
half
are
your
own
men
here
the
old
lady
face
brightened
up
towards
marion
and
giving
him
a
very
significant
look
she
said
ah
ha
general
did
i
tell
you
so
then
diving
her
withered
hand
in
her
pocket
she
scooped
up
a
shining
parcel
of
english
guineas
and
exultingly
cried
out
see
there
general
see
there
a
sight
for
you
and
every
penny
of
it
given
me
by
that
dear
good
gentleman
major
muckleworth
every
penny
of
it
sir
yes
and
if
you
will
but
believe
me
general
when
i
and
my
daughters
were
getting
breakfast
for
him
and
his
people
if
he
did
come
here
himself
with
his
sergeants
and
had
this
place
swept
out
all
so
sweet
and
clean
for
them
poor
sick
people
and
with
his
own
dear
hands
too
helped
that
gentleman
there
to
dress
and
doctor
the
poor
things
that
he
did
and
then
besides
all
that
general
he
was
such
a
sweet
spoken
gentleman
for
when
i
asked
him
how
his
men
came
to
be
hurt
so
he
did
not
like
that
beast
tarleton
turn
black
and
blue
in
the
face
and
fall
to
cursing
the
d
d
rebels
oh
no
not
he
indeed
but
he
said
with
a
smile
we
got
them
wounded
last
night
madam
in
a
little
brush
with
your
brave
countryman
general
marion
now
only
think
of
that
general
and
besides
when
he
was
going
away
what
do
you
think
he
did
why
sir
he
sent
for
me
and
said
well
my
good
madam
and
what
shall
i
pay
you
for
all
the
trouble
we
have
given
you
and
also
for
taking
care
of
the
doctor
i
am
going
to
leave
with
you
and
the
sick
people
who
may
be
on
your
hands
for
a
fortnight
yet
i
told
him
it
was
no
business
of
mine
to
fix
a
price
he
seemed
surprised
and
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
that
i
answered
that
i
was
now
all
one
as
his
prisoner
and
prisoners
had
nothing
they
could
call
their
own
my
king
madam
said
he
does
not
make
war
against
widows
i
told
him
i
wished
to
god
all
his
countrymen
had
remembered
that
it
would
have
saved
the
hunger
and
nakedness
and
cries
and
tears
of
many
a
poor
widow
and
orphan
at
this
he
seemed
mightily
hurt
i
then
told
him
that
many
of
the
british
officers
after
eating
and
drinking
all
that
they
wanted
for
themselves
and
people
and
horses
instead
of
turning
round
to
pay
as
he
had
done
had
turned
in
to
plunder
and
then
set
fire
to
the
houses
not
leaving
the
widows
and
children
a
cover
over
their
heads
nor
a
bit
of
bread
for
their
mouths
nor
a
stitch
of
clothes
for
their
backs
my
god
said
he
and
is
this
the
way
that
my
countrymen
have
come
here
to
carry
on
war
well
madam
so
he
went
on
my
king
does
not
know
any
thing
of
this
nor
does
the
english
nation
i
am
sure
if
they
did
they
would
certainly
call
those
officers
to
account
such
men
will
ruin
our
cause
for
the
word
of
god
assures
us
that
his
ear
is
always
open
to
the
cry
of
the
widow
and
orphan
and
believe
me
madam
i
dread
their
cry
more
than
i
do
the
shouts
of
an
enemy
army
however
madam
continued
he
i
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
for
i
am
sure
general
marion
is
pursuing
me
as
hard
as
he
can
so
let
me
know
what
i
owe
you
i
told
him
again
i
made
no
charge
but
since
he
was
so
good
as
to
insist
on
giving
me
something
i
begged
to
leave
the
matter
entirely
to
himself
upon
which
after
a
moment
study
he
looked
at
me
and
said
well
madam
suppose
we
say
sixpence
sterling
man
and
horse
all
around
will
that
do
i
replied
that
was
too
much
a
great
deal
too
much
for
such
a
poor
breakfast
as
i
had
given
him
and
his
men
not
a
penny
too
much
madam
said
he
live
and
let
live
is
the
royal
law
madam
and
here
your
money
with
that
he
put
all
these
guineas
here
into
my
hand
and
said
moreover
that
if
the
doctor
and
sick
people
should
be
longer
with
me
and
give
me
more
trouble
and
cost
than
we
had
counted
on
then
i
must
send
a
note
to
him
at
such
a
house
in
charleston
and
he
would
send
me
the
money
and
now
general
would
it
not
be
a
burning
shame
to
go
kill
such
a
dear
good
gentleman
as
that
marion
listened
with
delight
to
the
old
lady
history
of
this
amiable
officer
but
on
her
leaving
him
to
hasten
our
breakfast
he
looked
very
pensive
and
at
a
loss
what
to
do
however
as
soon
as
the
troops
were
refreshed
he
ordered
my
brother
colonel
horry
who
led
the
advance
to
remount
and
push
after
the
enemy
with
all
speed
we
followed
close
in
the
rear
for
an
hour
the
general
did
not
open
his
mouth
but
rode
on
like
one
absorbed
in
thought
at
length
heaving
a
deep
sigh
he
said
well
i
suppose
i
feel
now
very
much
as
i
should
feel
were
i
in
pursuit
of
a
brother
to
kill
him
about
three
our
advance
came
up
with
the
enemy
near
the
wealthy
and
hospitable
captain
john
singleton
mills
where
the
firing
instantly
commenced
and
was
as
spiritedly
returned
by
the
british
still
retreating
our
marksmen
presently
stopped
one
of
muckleworth
captains
and
several
of
his
men
who
lay
dead
on
the
ground
at
the
very
spot
where
we
happened
to
join
the
advance
the
sight
of
these
poor
fellows
lying
in
their
blood
gave
the
general
wavering
mind
the
casting
vote
in
favor
of
generosity
for
he
immediately
cried
out
call
off
the
troops
call
off
the
troops
then
turning
to
his
aid
he
said
i
can
not
stand
it
any
longer
we
owe
yon
englishmen
to
our
injured
country
but
there
is
an
angel
that
guards
them
ten
righteous
lots
would
have
saved
sodom
one
generous
muckleworth
shall
save
this
handful
let
us
turn
and
fight
other
enemies
the
general
orders
were
quickly
passed
on
to
the
troops
to
cease
firing
and
to
their
credit
be
it
spoken
they
never
i
believe
obeyed
his
orders
with
more
alacrity
than
on
this
occasion
indeed
i
heard
many
of
them
say
afterwards
that
major
muckleworth
generosity
to
their
wounded
comrades
and
to
the
poor
widow
had
so
won
their
hearts
to
him
that
they
had
none
left
wherewith
to
fight
against
him
and
they
said
also
that
for
their
parts
they
had
rather
kill
a
thousand
such
savages
as
rawdon
and
tarleton
than
hurt
a
hair
of
major
muckleworth
head
from
the
effect
produced
on
our
troops
by
this
amiable
officer
conduct
i
have
often
been
led
to
think
favorably
of
a
saying
common
with
marion
had
the
british
officers
but
acted
as
became
a
wise
and
magnanimous
enemy
they
might
easily
have
recovered
the
revolted
colonies
never
did
the
pulse
of
love
towards
a
parent
state
beat
stronger
in
human
bosoms
than
in
those
of
the
carolinians
towards
britain
we
looked
on
her
as
indeed
our
mother
and
on
her
children
as
our
brothers
and
ah
had
their
government
but
treated
us
with
correspondent
kindness
carolina
would
have
been
with
them
to
a
man
had
they
said
to
the
people
as
they
might
easily
have
done
for
there
was
a
time
and
a
long
time
too
when
the
whole
state
was
entirely
at
their
feet
had
they
then
said
to
us
we
are
far
richer
far
stronger
than
you
we
can
easily
burn
your
houses
take
your
provisions
carry
off
your
cattle
and
sweep
your
country
with
the
besom
of
destruction
but
we
abhor
the
idea
your
houses
your
women
your
children
are
all
sacred
in
our
eyes
and
even
of
your
goods
we
will
touch
nothing
without
giving
you
a
reasonable
price
had
they
but
said
this
carolina
would
to
a
certainty
have
been
divorced
from
congress
and
to
britain
we
may
lay
what
emphasis
we
please
on
the
term
countrymen
countrymen
but
after
all
as
christ
says
he
is
our
countryman
who
showeth
mercy
unto
us
a
british
officer
a
major
muckleworth
for
example
calls
at
my
plantation
and
takes
my
fine
horses
and
fat
beeves
my
pigs
my
poultry
and
grain
but
at
parting
launches
out
for
me
a
fist
full
of
yellow
boys
on
the
other
hand
an
american
officer
calls
and
sweeps
me
of
everything
and
then
lugs
out
a
bundle
of
continental
proc
such
trash
that
hardly
a
cow
would
give
a
corn
shock
for
a
horse
load
of
it
the
englishman
leaves
me
richer
than
he
found
me
and
abler
to
educate
and
provide
for
my
children
the
american
leaves
me
and
my
family
half
ruined
now
i
wish
to
know
where
in
such
a
selfish
world
as
this
where
is
there
a
man
in
a
million
but
would
take
part
with
the
generous
englishman
and
fight
for
him
this
was
the
theory
of
marion
and
it
was
the
practice
of
muckleworth
whom
it
certainly
saved
to
the
british
and
would
if
universal
have
saved
carolina
and
georgia
to
them
too
and
perhaps
all
america
but
so
little
idea
had
they
of
this
mode
of
conciliating
to
conquer
that
when
the
good
major
muckleworth
returned
to
charleston
he
was
hooted
at
by
the
british
officers
who
said
he
might
do
well
enough
for
a
chaplain
or
a
methodist
preacher
for
what
they
knew
but
they
be
d
if
he
were
fit
to
be
a
british
major
the
truth
is
such
divine
philosophy
was
too
refined
for
such
coarse
and
vulgar
characters
as
cornwallis
rawdon
tarleton
balfour
and
weymies
monsters
who
disgraced
the
brave
and
generous
nation
they
represented
and
completely
damned
the
cause
they
were
sent
to
save
but
what
better
was
to
have
been
expected
of
those
who
from
early
life
if
tradition
say
true
discovered
a
total
dislike
to
the
ennobling
pleasures
of
literature
and
devotion
but
a
boundless
passion
for
the
brutalizing
sports
of
the
and
and
dog
worriers
turned
officers
had
no
idea
of
conquering
the
americans
but
by
cutting
their
throats
or
knocking
out
their
brains
or
as
the
cornwallis
commanded
by
hanging
them
and
taking
away
or
destroying
their
goods
now
satan
himself
could
have
counselled
my
lord
better
than
that
as
any
man
may
see
who
will
but
open
his
bible
and
turn
to
the
book
of
job
chap
the
verse
and
so
on
there
moses
informs
that
when
satan
whose
effrontery
is
up
to
any
thing
presented
himself
at
the
grand
levee
the
almighty
very
civilly
asked
him
now
mind
that
in
your
speech
to
poor
sinners
the
almighty
i
say
very
civilly
asked
him
where
he
had
been
of
late
to
this
his
royal
highness
the
brimstone
king
replied
that
he
had
been
only
taking
a
turn
or
two
up
and
down
the
earth
the
divine
voice
again
interrogated
hast
thou
considered
my
servant
job
an
excellent
man
is
he
not
one
who
feareth
god
and
escheweth
evil
job
well
enough
replied
satan
rather
pertly
but
the
wonder
of
all
that
you
have
done
great
things
for
the
fellow
you
have
planted
a
hedge
around
him
and
around
all
that
he
hath
on
every
side
you
have
blessed
the
works
of
his
hands
and
his
substance
is
increased
in
the
land
and
if
after
all
this
he
can
not
afford
you
a
little
gratitude
he
must
be
a
poor
devil
indeed
but
put
forth
thy
hand
now
and
touch
all
that
he
hath
and
he
curse
thee
to
thy
face
this
was
the
devil
logic
as
to
job
but
the
british
general
had
not
the
wit
to
reason
in
that
style
towards
the
americans
for
my
lord
cornwallis
said
unto
my
lord
rawdon
and
my
lord
rawdon
said
unto
my
lord
colonel
tarleton
and
colonel
tarleton
said
unto
major
weymies
and
major
weymies
said
unto
will
cunningham
and
unto
the
british
soldiers
with
their
tory
negro
allies
put
forth
your
hands
boys
and
burn
and
plunder
the
d
rebels
and
instead
of
cursing
you
to
your
face
they
will
fall
down
and
kiss
your
feet
experience
says
doctor
franklin
is
a
dear
school
but
fools
will
learn
in
no
other
and
hardly
in
that
and
what
right
had
lord
north
to
expect
success
in
america
when
for
officers
he
sent
such
fools
as
would
take
no
lesson
either
from
god
or
devil
chapter
colonel
watson
attempts
to
surprise
marion
is
and
after
much
loss
driven
back
to
georgetown
in
consequence
of
his
incessant
attacks
on
the
british
and
tories
marion
was
i
believe
heartily
hated
by
them
as
ever
samson
was
by
the
philistines
or
george
whitefield
by
the
devil
numerous
were
the
attempts
made
by
their
best
officers
to
surprise
him
but
such
was
his
own
vigilance
and
the
fidelity
of
his
whig
friends
that
he
seldom
failed
to
get
the
first
blow
at
them
and
to
take
their
unwary
feet
in
the
same
evil
net
which
they
had
spread
for
him
his
method
to
anticipate
the
meditated
malice
of
his
enemies
is
well
worthy
of
notice
he
always
had
in
his
service
a
parcel
of
active
young
men
generally
selected
from
the
best
whig
families
and
of
tried
courage
and
fidelity
these
mounted
on
the
swiftest
horses
he
would
station
in
the
neighborhood
of
those
places
where
the
british
and
tories
were
embodied
in
force
as
camden
georgetown
with
instructions
to
leave
no
stratagem
untried
to
find
out
the
intended
movements
of
the
enemy
instantly
as
this
information
was
obtained
whether
by
climbing
tall
trees
that
overlooked
the
garrisons
or
from
friends
acting
as
market
people
they
were
to
mount
and
push
off
at
full
speed
to
the
nearest
of
a
chain
of
posts
established
at
short
and
convenient
distances
with
fleet
horses
ready
saddled
and
bridled
to
bear
the
intelligence
with
equal
speed
the
first
to
the
second
the
second
to
the
third
and
so
on
in
this
expeditious
method
as
by
a
telegraph
marion
was
presently
notified
of
the
designs
of
the
enemy
of
the
exceeding
importance
of
such
a
plan
we
had
a
very
striking
proof
at
this
time
exasperated
against
marion
for
the
infinite
harm
he
did
the
royal
cause
in
carolina
the
british
general
in
camden
determined
to
surprise
him
at
his
old
place
of
retreat
snow
island
and
thus
destroy
or
break
him
up
completely
to
this
end
he
despatched
a
couple
of
favorite
officers
colonels
watson
and
doyle
with
a
heavy
force
both
cavalry
and
infantry
to
seize
the
lower
bridge
on
black
river
and
thereby
effectually
prevent
our
escape
but
the
vigilance
and
activity
of
his
scouts
frustrated
this
plan
entirely
getting
early
notice
of
this
manoeuvre
by
captain
now
general
canty
marion
instantly
started
his
troops
composed
chiefly
of
mounted
riflemen
and
light
dragoons
and
pushed
hard
for
the
same
point
by
taking
a
nearer
cut
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
gain
the
bridge
before
the
enemy
and
having
destroyed
it
as
soon
as
we
crossed
we
concealed
ourselves
in
the
dark
swamp
anxiously
waiting
their
arrival
in
a
short
time
they
came
in
full
view
on
the
opposite
hill
and
there
encamped
presently
unapprehensive
of
danger
for
they
saw
nothing
of
us
two
of
their
men
came
down
for
water
to
the
river
unable
to
resist
such
a
temptation
two
of
our
noted
marksmen
instantly
drew
their
sights
and
let
fly
the
two
englishmen
fell
one
of
them
was
killed
dead
the
other
badly
wounded
and
so
frightened
that
he
bellowed
like
a
for
help
several
of
his
gallant
countrymen
ran
to
his
assistance
but
they
were
shot
down
as
fast
as
they
got
to
him
the
old
meaning
of
telegraph
is
used
here
as
any
system
of
communication
over
distance
such
as
signal
fires
semaphore
etc
the
next
morning
colonel
watson
sent
a
flag
over
to
marion
whom
he
charged
with
carrying
on
war
in
a
manner
entirely
different
from
all
civilized
nations
why
sir
said
he
to
marion
you
must
certainly
command
a
horde
of
savages
who
delight
in
nothing
but
murder
i
ca
cross
a
swamp
or
a
bridge
but
i
am
waylaid
and
shot
at
as
if
i
were
a
mad
dog
even
my
sentries
are
fired
at
and
killed
on
their
posts
why
my
god
sir
this
is
not
the
way
that
christians
ought
to
fight
to
this
marion
replied
that
he
was
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
say
that
from
what
he
had
known
of
them
the
british
officers
were
the
last
men
on
earth
who
had
any
right
to
preach
about
honor
and
humanity
that
for
men
to
come
three
thousand
miles
to
plunder
and
hang
an
innocent
people
and
then
to
tell
that
people
how
they
ought
to
fight
betrayed
an
ignorance
and
impudence
which
he
fain
would
hope
had
no
parallel
in
the
history
of
man
that
for
his
part
he
always
believed
and
still
did
believe
that
he
should
be
doing
god
and
his
country
good
service
to
surprise
and
kill
such
men
while
they
continued
this
diabolical
warfare
as
he
would
the
wolves
and
panthers
of
the
forest
thus
ended
the
correspondence
for
that
time
while
things
remained
in
this
state
between
the
hostile
parties
macdonald
as
usual
was
employing
himself
in
a
close
and
bold
reconnoitre
of
the
enemy
camp
having
found
out
the
situation
of
their
sentries
and
the
times
of
relieving
them
he
climbed
up
into
a
bushy
tree
and
thence
with
a
musket
loaded
with
pistol
bullets
cracked
away
at
their
guard
as
they
passed
by
of
whom
he
killed
one
man
and
badly
wounded
the
lieutenant
whose
name
was
torquano
then
sliding
down
the
tree
he
mounted
his
selim
and
made
his
escape
the
next
morning
colonel
watson
sent
another
flag
to
marion
requesting
that
he
would
grant
a
passport
to
his
lieutenant
torquano
who
was
badly
wounded
and
wished
to
be
carried
to
charleston
on
receiving
the
flag
which
happened
while
i
was
by
him
marion
turned
to
me
and
with
a
smile
said
well
this
note
of
colonel
watson
looks
a
little
as
if
he
were
coming
to
his
senses
but
who
is
lieutenant
torquano
i
replied
that
he
was
a
young
englishman
who
had
been
quartered
in
charleston
at
the
house
of
that
good
whig
lady
brainford
and
her
daughters
whom
he
had
treated
very
politely
and
often
protected
from
insults
well
said
he
if
that
be
lieutenant
torquano
he
must
be
a
very
clever
fellow
and
shall
certainly
have
a
passport
to
charleston
or
even
to
paradise
if
i
had
the
keys
of
st
peter
on
repassing
black
river
in
haste
macdonald
had
left
his
clothes
behind
him
at
a
poor
woman
house
where
the
enemy
seized
them
by
the
return
of
the
flag
just
mentioned
he
sent
word
to
colonel
watson
that
if
he
did
not
immediately
send
back
his
clothes
he
would
kill
eight
of
his
men
to
pay
for
them
several
of
watson
officers
who
were
present
when
the
message
was
delivered
advised
him
by
all
means
to
return
his
clothes
for
that
they
knew
him
to
be
a
most
desperate
fellow
one
who
would
stop
at
nothing
he
set
his
head
upon
witness
his
late
daring
act
of
climbing
like
a
cougar
into
a
tree
to
kill
his
passing
enemies
watson
sent
him
back
his
wallet
of
clothes
soon
after
this
the
enemy
decamped
silently
in
the
night
and
took
the
road
towards
santee
on
the
return
of
day
announcing
their
flight
marion
ordered
me
to
take
the
mounted
riflemen
thirty
in
number
with
fifty
horse
and
pursue
and
harass
the
enemy
as
much
as
possible
till
he
could
come
up
with
the
infantry
about
night
i
approached
their
encampment
and
halted
in
a
neighboring
swamp
whence
i
continued
to
send
out
small
parties
frequently
relieved
with
orders
to
pop
away
at
their
sentinels
and
keep
them
alarmed
and
under
arms
all
night
at
daybreak
they
pushed
hard
for
the
sandpit
bridge
we
followed
close
in
the
rear
constantly
firing
on
them
from
every
thicket
and
swamp
and
often
in
spite
of
their
field
pieces
making
false
charges
never
did
i
see
a
body
of
infantry
ply
their
legs
so
briskly
the
rogues
were
constantly
in
a
dog
trot
except
when
they
occasionally
halted
to
give
us
a
blast
which
they
did
from
their
whole
line
but
though
their
bullets
made
a
confounded
whizzing
and
clatter
among
the
branches
over
our
heads
yet
thank
god
they
did
no
harm
save
that
of
scratching
some
three
or
four
of
us
on
coming
within
a
few
miles
of
it
we
made
a
rapid
push
for
the
bridge
which
we
quickly
rendered
impassable
by
throwing
off
the
plank
and
sleepers
then
having
posted
my
riflemen
in
the
thick
woods
within
fifty
yards
of
the
ford
under
command
of
lieutenant
scott
i
drew
up
my
cavalry
close
in
the
rear
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
enemy
hoping
to
give
a
handsome
bunker
hill
account
of
them
the
enemy
were
presently
in
sight
and
formed
in
close
column
began
to
push
through
the
fording
place
though
full
waist
deep
my
heart
now
throbbed
with
anxiety
looking
every
moment
for
a
stream
of
fire
to
burst
upon
the
british
spreading
destruction
through
their
ranks
but
to
my
infinite
mortification
no
lightnings
bursted
forth
no
thunders
roared
no
enemy
fell
as
half
choked
with
grief
and
rage
i
looked
around
for
the
cause
behold
my
brave
lieutenant
scott
at
the
head
of
his
riflemen
came
stooping
along
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
the
black
marks
of
shame
and
cowardice
on
his
sheepish
face
infamous
poltroon
said
i
shaking
my
sword
over
his
head
where
is
that
hetacomb
of
robbers
and
murderers
due
to
the
vengeance
of
your
injured
country
he
began
to
stammer
out
some
apology
which
i
quickly
suppressed
by
ordering
him
out
of
my
sight
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
his
men
instead
of
apologising
for
him
called
him
a
coward
to
his
face
and
declared
that
it
was
he
who
had
restrained
them
by
telling
them
they
were
flanked
by
the
enemy
who
would
assuredly
cut
them
to
pieces
if
they
fired
a
shot
as
the
advance
of
the
british
were
thus
undisturbedly
passing
on
a
heavy
firing
was
suddenly
heard
in
the
rear
it
was
marion
who
having
come
up
with
the
enemy
had
attacked
him
with
great
fury
the
british
did
not
halt
but
continued
a
running
fight
through
the
woods
till
they
gained
the
open
fields
where
by
means
of
their
artillery
they
kept
us
at
a
distance
in
this
rencontre
watson
had
his
horse
killed
under
him
and
left
about
twenty
of
his
men
dead
on
the
ground
his
wounded
filled
several
wagons
he
did
not
halt
a
moment
but
pushed
hard
for
georgetown
and
late
at
night
encamped
on
the
plantation
of
trapier
to
whom
he
told
a
dreadful
story
about
marion
and
his
damned
rebels
who
would
not
as
he
said
sleep
and
fight
like
gentlemen
but
like
savages
were
eternally
firing
and
whooping
around
him
by
night
and
by
day
waylaying
and
popping
at
him
from
behind
every
tree
he
went
by
as
it
was
too
late
to
pursue
the
enemy
marion
encamped
for
the
night
near
the
field
of
battle
and
next
morning
marched
for
his
old
post
snow
island
where
he
allowed
us
a
few
days
of
welcome
repose
chapter

he
dashes
out
again
upon
the
enemy
prospects
brighten
and
the
good
old
cause
begins
to
look
up
again
it
was
not
for
the
british
and
marion
to
lie
long
at
rest
in
the
same
neighborhood
after
a
short
repose
colonel
watson
with
a
stout
force
of
regulars
and
tories
made
an
inroad
upon
pedee
which
was
no
sooner
known
in
our
camp
than
marion
pushed
after
him
we
presently
struck
their
trail
and
after
a
handsome
day
run
pitched
our
tents
near
the
house
of
the
excellent
widow
jenkins
and
on
the
very
spot
which
the
british
had
left
in
the
morning
colonel
watson
it
seems
had
taken
his
quarters
that
night
in
her
house
and
learning
that
she
had
three
sons
with
marion
all
active
young
men
he
sent
for
her
after
supper
and
desired
her
to
sit
down
and
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
to
this
request
a
good
old
lady
of
taste
and
manners
could
have
no
objection
so
waiting
upon
the
colonel
and
taking
a
chair
which
he
handed
her
she
sat
down
and
emptied
her
glass
to
his
health
he
then
commenced
the
following
conversation
with
her
so
madam
they
tell
me
you
have
several
sons
in
general
marion
camp
i
hope
it
is
not
true
she
said
it
was
very
true
and
was
only
sorry
that
it
was
not
a
thousand
times
truer
a
thousand
times
truer
madam
replied
he
with
great
surprise
pray
what
can
be
your
meaning
in
that
why
sir
i
am
only
sorry
that
in
place
of
three
i
have
not
three
thousand
sons
with
general
marion
aye
indeed
well
then
madam
begging
your
pardon
you
had
better
send
for
them
immediately
to
come
in
and
join
his
majesty
troops
under
my
command
for
as
they
are
rebels
now
in
arms
against
their
king
should
they
be
taken
they
will
be
hung
as
sure
as
ever
they
were
born
why
sir
said
the
old
lady
you
are
very
considerate
of
my
sons
for
which
at
any
rate
i
thank
you
but
as
you
have
begged
my
pardon
for
giving
me
this
advice
i
must
beg
yours
for
not
taking
it
my
sons
sir
are
of
age
and
must
and
will
act
for
themselves
and
as
to
their
being
in
a
state
of
rebellion
against
their
king
i
must
take
the
liberty
sir
to
deny
that
what
madam
replied
he
not
in
rebellion
against
their
king
shooting
at
and
killing
his
majesty
subjects
like
wolves
do
you
call
that
rebellion
against
their
king
madam
no
sir
answered
she
they
are
only
doing
their
duty
as
god
and
nature
commanded
them
sir
the
d
they
are
madam
yes
sir
continued
she
and
what
you
and
every
man
in
england
would
glory
to
do
against
the
king
were
he
to
dare
to
tax
you
contrary
to
your
own
consent
and
the
constitution
of
the
realm
is
the
king
sir
who
is
in
rebellion
against
my
sons
and
not
they
against
him
and
could
right
prevail
against
might
he
would
as
certainly
lose
his
head
as
ever
king
charles
the
first
did
colonel
watson
could
hardly
keep
his
chair
under
the
smart
of
this
speech
but
thinking
it
would
never
do
for
a
british
colonel
to
be
rude
to
a
lady
he
filled
her
glass
and
saying
he
be
d
if
she
were
not
a
very
woman
at
any
rate
insisted
she
would
drink
a
toast
with
him
for
all
she
replied
she
had
no
objection
then
filling
the
glasses
round
he
looked
at
her
with
a
constrained
smile
and
said
well
madam
here
george
the
third
with
all
my
heart
sir
and
turned
off
her
bumper
with
a
good
grace
after
a
decent
interval
of
sprightly
conversation
he
called
on
the
widow
for
a
toast
who
very
smartly
retorted
well
sir
here
george
washington
at
which
he
darkened
a
little
but
drank
it
off
with
an
politeness
the
next
morning
early
we
left
the
good
jenkins
and
burning
with
impatience
to
give
watson
another
race
we
drove
on
we
encamped
that
night
almost
within
sight
of
the
enemy
fires
but
found
them
too
much
on
the
alert
for
surprise
we
kept
however
a
good
look
out
and
learning
next
morning
that
a
roosting
party
were
out
marion
detached
my
brother
colonel
horry
with
some
choice
cavaliers
to
attack
them
which
he
did
with
such
spirit
that
at
the
first
onset
he
killed
nine
and
made
the
balance
sixteen
all
prisoners
the
rogues
were
so
overloaded
with
plunder
that
for
their
lives
they
could
not
regain
their
camp
though
in
full
view
of
it
when
they
were
charged
this
brilliant
stroke
of
my
brother
threw
the
enemy
camp
into
the
utmost
hurry
and
uproar
and
their
dragoons
were
quickly
mounted
dashing
out
to
rescue
their
comrades
but
in
vain
for
my
brother
brought
them
all
off
in
safety
to
our
camp
our
strength
at
this
time
was
far
inferior
to
that
of
the
enemy
but
it
soon
became
alarmingly
reduced
for
learning
that
besides
this
heavy
force
under
watson
there
was
another
from
camden
under
colonel
doyle
and
also
of
mounted
tories
from
pedee
all
in
full
march
against
us
our
men
took
a
panic
and
began
to
desert
and
those
who
stayed
behind
looked
very
serious
and
talked
as
if
certain
ruin
both
to
themselves
and
families
would
follow
from
their
continuing
to
fight
in
so
hopeless
a
cause
in
answer
to
these
desponding
gentlemen
i
replied
that
i
was
ashamed
and
grieved
too
to
hear
them
talk
at
that
rate
our
prospects
said
i
gentlemen
are
to
be
sure
dark
very
dark
yet
thank
god
they
are
not
desperate
we
have
often
before
now
seen
as
heavy
clouds
hanging
over
us
and
yet
with
heaven
blessing
on
our
arms
those
clouds
have
been
dispersed
and
golden
days
restored
and
who
knows
but
we
may
shortly
see
it
so
again
i
am
sure
we
have
good
reason
to
expect
it
and
also
to
hope
that
god
will
assist
us
who
are
only
fighting
to
make
ourselves
free
and
happy
according
to
his
own
most
blessed
will
and
will
it
not
be
a
most
sweet
cordial
to
your
spirits
as
long
as
you
live
to
think
that
in
such
trying
times
as
these
you
stood
up
for
your
country
and
fought
and
won
for
yourselves
and
children
all
the
blessings
of
liberty
and
besides
said
i
do
not
the
tories
who
are
more
than
half
the
authors
of
your
misfortunes
possess
large
estates
and
have
you
not
arms
in
your
hands
wherewith
to
pay
yourselves
out
of
their
treasures
this
speech
seemed
to
raise
their
spirits
a
good
deal
i
then
went
to
see
the
general
who
with
his
hands
behind
him
was
walking
backwards
and
forwards
in
front
of
his
tent
meditating
no
doubt
on
the
desertion
of
his
men
whose
numbers
from
more
than
two
hundred
were
now
reduced
to
less
than
seventy
general
marion
said
i
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
our
men
are
now
so
few
especially
since
according
to
report
we
shall
soon
want
so
many
why
replied
he
that
is
the
very
thing
i
have
been
grieving
at
but
it
will
signify
nothing
for
us
to
stand
here
sighing
and
croaking
so
pray
go
and
order
a
muster
of
the
men
that
i
may
say
a
few
words
to
them
before
they
all
run
off
and
leave
me
soon
as
the
troops
were
all
paraded
around
the
door
of
his
tent
he
stepped
upon
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
pine
and
in
his
plain
but
impressive
manner
addressed
us
nearly
as
follows
gentlemen
and
it
is
not
for
words
to
express
what
i
feel
when
i
look
around
upon
your
diminished
numbers
yesterday
i
commanded
men
men
whom
i
gloried
in
and
who
i
fondly
thought
would
have
followed
me
through
my
dangers
for
their
country
and
now
when
their
country
most
needs
their
services
they
are
nearly
all
gone
and
even
those
of
you
who
remain
are
if
report
be
true
quite
out
of
heart
and
talk
that
you
and
your
families
must
be
ruined
if
you
resist
any
longer
but
my
friends
if
we
shall
be
ruined
for
bravely
resisting
our
tyrants
what
will
be
done
to
us
if
we
tamely
lie
down
and
submit
to
them
in
that
event
what
can
we
expect
but
to
see
our
own
eternal
disgrace
and
the
ruin
of
our
country
when
our
bravest
and
best
citizens
shall
be
hung
up
like
dogs
and
their
property
confiscated
to
enrich
those
villains
who
deserted
their
country
and
joined
her
enemies
when
cornwallis
rawdon
and
tarleton
after
so
long
plundering
and
murdering
your
friends
shall
in
reward
of
such
services
be
set
over
you
as
your
governors
and
lord
lieutenants
with
princely
salaries
out
of
your
labors
when
foreign
bishops
and
hireling
clergy
shall
be
poured
upon
you
like
hosts
of
consecrated
locusts
consuming
the
tithes
and
fat
of
the
land
when
british
princes
and
nobles
and
judges
shall
swarm
over
your
devoted
country
thick
as
eagles
over
a
carcass
when
an
insatiate
king
looking
on
your
country
as
his
plantation
and
on
your
children
as
his
slaves
shall
take
away
your
substance
every
year
for
his
pomps
and
pleasures
and
to
keep
you
under
for
ever
shall
fill
your
land
with
armies
and
when
those
armies
viewing
you
with
malignant
eyes
shall
constantly
be
insulting
you
as
conquered
rebels
and
under
pretence
of
discovering
among
you
the
seeds
of
another
rebellion
shall
be
perpetually
harassing
and
giving
up
to
military
execution
the
best
and
worthiest
of
your
now
my
brave
brethren
in
arms
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
can
bear
the
thought
of
living
to
see
his
dear
country
and
friends
in
so
degraded
and
wretched
a
state
as
this
if
there
be
then
let
that
man
leave
me
and
retire
to
his
home
i
ask
not
his
aid
but
thanks
to
god
i
have
now
no
fears
about
you
judging
by
your
looks
i
feel
that
there
is
no
such
man
among
us
for
my
own
part
i
look
upon
such
a
state
of
things
as
a
thousand
times
worse
than
death
and
god
is
my
judge
this
day
that
if
i
could
die
a
thousand
deaths
most
gladly
would
i
die
them
all
rather
than
live
to
see
my
dear
country
in
such
a
state
of
degradation
and
wretchedness
in
reply
to
this
speech
of
our
honored
general
we
told
him
in
brief
it
was
on
account
of
his
noble
sentiments
we
had
always
so
highly
esteemed
him
that
it
was
on
account
of
these
we
had
already
suffered
so
much
and
were
ready
to
suffer
more
and
that
rather
than
see
our
country
in
that
wretched
state
which
he
had
so
feelingly
described
and
which
with
him
we
firmly
believed
would
be
the
case
if
the
british
were
to
get
the
upper
hand
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
fight
by
his
side
to
a
glorious
death
i
never
saw
such
a
change
on
the
face
of
a
human
being
as
then
took
place
on
that
of
marion
his
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
while
in
transport
he
exclaimed
well
now
colonel
doyle
look
sharp
for
you
shall
presently
feel
the
edge
of
our
swords
soon
as
night
came
on
we
mounted
and
took
the
swamps
of
lynch
creek
though
swimming
deep
and
after
a
long
time
spent
in
plunging
and
splashing
through
the
dark
floods
we
got
over
at
least
about
of
us
the
rest
driven
down
by
the
force
of
the
current
were
cast
ashore
on
hills
and
high
banks
which
by
the
freshet
were
converted
into
islands
and
there
they
continued
whooping
and
hallooing
to
each
other
all
night
when
the
welcome
light
returned
they
plunged
again
into
the
furious
stream
and
though
swept
down
a
good
way
by
the
force
of
the
current
arrived
safely
on
our
side
where
we
had
prepared
some
large
fires
to
dry
their
clothes
and
muskets
and
plenty
of
roasted
roots
and
indian
cakes
for
breakfast
as
god
was
pleased
to
have
it
none
of
us
lost
our
lives
though
many
did
their
great
coats
blankets
and
saddles
and
some
few
their
pieces
as
to
myself
i
must
needs
say
i
was
never
so
near
the
other
world
in
my
life
for
as
we
were
borne
along
down
the
stream
in
the
dark
my
horse
and
i
were
carried
under
the
limb
of
a
tree
hung
thick
with
wild
vines
which
soon
caught
me
by
the
head
like
absalom
and
there
held
me
fast
dangling
in
the
furious
flood
while
my
horse
was
swept
from
under
me
i
hallooed
for
some
time
like
a
lusty
fellow
without
getting
any
answer
which
made
me
begin
to
think
my
chance
was
bad
and
god
forgive
me
for
it
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
a
sad
thing
that
after
so
many
fierce
frays
and
hard
knocks
with
the
british
and
tories
i
should
come
at
last
to
be
choked
like
a
blind
puppy
in
this
dirty
swamp
but
god
be
praised
for
his
good
angel
who
had
brought
me
through
six
dangers
and
now
took
me
out
of
the
seventh
for
as
i
was
near
giving
out
a
bold
young
fellow
of
the
company
overheard
me
bawling
and
having
the
advantage
of
a
stout
horse
dashed
in
and
took
me
safely
off
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
my
horse
was
drowned
but
sagaciously
following
the
rest
of
the
horses
he
made
his
way
good
but
lost
my
saddle
great
coat
and
clothes
but
what
grieved
me
most
of
all
was
the
loss
of
my
holsters
with
a
pair
of
elegant
silver
mounted
pistols
a
present
from
macdonald
and
which
he
had
taken
from
a
british
officer
whom
he
killed
near
georgetown
soon
as
our
firearms
were
dried
and
ourselves
and
horses
were
refreshed
we
mounted
and
rode
hard
all
that
day
to
surprise
colonel
doyle
about
midnight
we
had
approached
the
house
of
a
good
whig
who
told
us
that
doyle
had
been
there
but
that
warned
by
an
express
from
camden
he
had
started
in
great
haste
and
was
certainly
by
that
time
far
beyond
our
reach
we
were
much
puzzled
in
our
minds
for
the
meaning
of
this
precipitate
retreat
of
colonel
doyle
however
after
one
day
of
welcome
rest
and
high
cheer
we
faced
about
fully
determined
notwithstanding
our
inferiority
of
force
once
more
to
try
our
fortune
with
colonel
watson
but
in
reaching
the
ground
where
we
had
left
him
encamped
we
got
advice
that
he
too
with
all
his
troops
were
gone
off
at
a
tangent
as
hard
as
he
could
drive
while
we
were
wondering
what
could
have
possessed
the
british
to
scamper
thus
in
every
direction
captain
conyers
of
lee
legion
hove
in
sight
with
the
welcome
news
that
the
brave
colonel
lee
was
at
hand
coming
up
full
tilt
to
join
us
and
also
that
general
green
with
a
choice
detachment
from
the
great
washington
was
bending
towards
camden
to
recover
the
laurels
which
the
incautious
gates
had
lost
these
glorious
tidings
at
once
explained
the
cause
of
the
enemy
flight
and
inspired
us
with
a
joy
which
the
reader
can
better
conceive
than

than
did

so
do
i

such

you

no

could
ever
yet
bear
to
see
his
wife

and

enslaved
and
miserable
such
was
marion
method
of
making
soldiers
and
what
with
this
and
the
cruelty
of
the
british
and
tories
he
had
with
him
perhaps
some
of
as
brave
and
desperate
men
as
ever
fought
never
ride
a
free
horse
to
death
he
used
to
say
to
his
officers
push
while
he
is
fresh
but
soon
as
he
begins
to
lag
then
lie
by
and
feed
high
is
your
play
for
this
purpose
he
always
kept
a
snug
in
reserve
for
us
which
was
snow
island
a
most
romantic
spot
and
admirably
fitted
to
our
use
nature
had
guarded
it
nearly
all
around
with
deep
waters
and
inaccessible
marshes
and
the
neighboring
gentlemen
were
all
rich
and
hearty
whigs
who
acted
by
us
the
double
part
of
generous
stewards
and
faithful
spies
so
that
while
there
we
lived
at
once
in
safety
and
plenty
we
had
reposed
ourselves
but
two
days
in
the
pleasant
wilds
of
snow
island
before
marion
learning
that
a
part
of
the
enemy
were
in
the
neighborhood
desired
me
to
take
captains
clarke
and
irwin
with
fifty
men
and
try
if
i
could
not
bring
him
a
good
account
of
them
we
encamped
the
first
night
on
the
plantation
of
john
withers
where
hearing
that
kinloch
our
member
of
congress
was
at
a
neighboring
house
i
sent
him
the
following
note
honorable
sir
if
in
these
dangerous
times
you
can
think
yourself
safe
among
a
handful
of
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
at
our
camp
as
to
supper
thank
god
we
can
give
you
a
trencher
of
fat
pork
and
potatoes
but
for
bed
and
furniture
we
can
promise
you
nothing
better
than
earth
and
sky
i
shall
place
a
sentinel
on
the
road
to
conduct
you
to
honorable
sir
your
friend
peter
horry
kinloch
who
was
one
of
the
cleverest
men
in
the
world
instantly
set
out
to
come
to
us
but
unluckily
missed
our
sentinel
and
went
several
miles
below
us
to
alexander
rose
plantation
managed
by
a
mulatto
driver
named
jonathan
the
day
being
nearly
spent
jonathan
very
politely
urged
kinloch
to
alight
and
spend
the
night
there
promising
him
a
warm
supper
and
a
good
bed
kinloch
accepted
jonathan
offer
very
cheerfully
and
after
taking
part
of
a
nice
fowl
and
a
cup
of
coffee
went
to
bed
he
had
not
slept
long
before
jonathan
waked
him
up
and
with
great
terror
in
his
looks
told
him
he
was
mighty
there
was
harm
aye
jonathan
why
so
my
good
lad
oh
sir
replied
jonathan
such
a
dream
as
i
have
had
sir
a
marvellous
bad
dream
about
the
enemy
coming
upon
you
sir
poh
quoth
kinloch
turning
himself
over
for
another
nap
i
have
dreamed
nothing
about
it
jonathan
and
i
sure
such
a
dream
ought
to
have
come
to
me
and
not
to
you
so
we
even
go
to
sleep
again
and
trust
to
heaven
accordingly
he
fell
asleep
a
second
time
but
had
not
long
enjoyed
that
sweetest
of
opiates
before
jonathan
comes
again
and
awakes
him
with
the
old
story
of
his
dream
well
jonathan
said
kinloch
very
if
you
are
determined
to
turn
me
out
of
doors
i
suppose
i
must
go
but
where
can
i
get
to
this
time
of
night
why
sir
quoth
jonathan
i
get
your
horse
and
go
with
you
to
the
main
road
sir
and
from
there
you
ca
miss
your
way
back
to
the
house
you
came
from
this
afternoon
on
jonathan
return
from
the
short
distance
he
had
conducted
kinloch
he
found
the
yard
filled
with
the
british
light
horse
these
dreams
are
droll
things
but
they
sometimes
come
so
well
attested
that
there
is
no
doubting
them
he
who
made
our
frame
can
certainly
speak
to
us
as
well
asleep
as
awake
and
the
wise
will
feel
the
importance
of
making
a
friend
of
him
who
can
cause
an
airy
dream
to
defend
us
as
effectually
as
a
legion
of
angels
the
next
night
just
as
we
were
about
to
encamp
we
lighted
on
a
negro
fellow
belonging
to
joseph
alston
whom
i
quickly
had
by
the
heels
lest
he
should
give
intelligence
to
the
enemy
but
as
the
devil
would
have
it
just
before
day
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
overcome
by
the
negro
importunities
loosened
him
and
let
him
go
and
mark
now
young
officers
what
comes
from
disobeying
orders
this
villain
of
a
blackamoor
had
not
gone
above
three
miles
before
he
fell
in
with
the
british
to
whom
he
betrayed
us
off
hand
and
they
as
quickly
took
horse
and
pushed
on
to
surprise
us
by
sunrise
i
had
all
my
men
mounted
captain
clarke
leading
the
advance
myself
and
captain
irvin
bringing
up
the
rest
of
the
corps
the
british
first
discovered
captain
clarke
which
they
did
in
the
way
of
a
glimpse
through
an
opening
in
the
woods
then
sounding
their
bugles
they
rushed
on
to
the
charge
unfortunately
clarke
had
not
yet
seen
the
enemy
and
mistaking
their
bugles
for
the
huntsmen
horns
ordered
a
halt
to
see
the
deer
go
by
but
instead
of
a
herd
of
flying
deer
behold
a
column
of
british
cavalry
all
at
once
bursting
into
the
road
and
shouting
and
rushing
on
with
drawn
swords
to
the
charge
in
a
moment
as
if
themselves
metamorphosed
into
deer
clarke
and
his
advance
wheeled
about
and
giving
their
horses
the
timber
flew
back
upon
our
main
body
roaring
out
as
they
came
in
sight
the
british
the
british
this
is
a
carolina
phrase
for
slashing
if
a
husband
should
so
far
forget
himself
as
to
beat
his
wife
which
thank
god
is
very
rare
his
neighbors
with
great
scorn
say
of
him
as
he
pokes
his
hated
face
along
aye
that
the
jockey
that
gives
his
wife
the
timber
quick
as
thought
my
men
caught
the
panic
and
facing
about
took
to
their
heels
and
went
off
as
if
the
d
had
been
behind
them
i
bawled
after
them
as
loud
as
i
could
roar
halt
halt
but
i
might
as
well
have
bawled
to
the
whirlwinds
for
it
appeared
to
me
the
louder
i
bawled
the
swifter
the
rascals
flew
whereupon
i
clapped
spurs
to
my
young
janus
and
went
off
after
them
at
full
stretch
hoping
to
gain
their
front
and
so
bring
them
to
being
mounted
on
a
young
charger
fresh
and
strong
from
the
stable
i
bid
fair
to
gain
my
point
too
for
i
was
coming
up
with
them
hand
over
hand
but
in
that
very
juncture
of
time
as
the
lord
was
pleased
to
order
it
my
girth
gave
way
my
saddle
turned
and
my
charger
fetching
a
ground
start
threw
me
saddle
holsters
and
all
full
ten
feet
over
his
head
and
then
ran
off
i
received
no
harm
god
be
praised
for
it
but
recovering
my
legs
in
an
instant
bawled
out
again
to
my
men
to
halt
and
form
happily
for
me
at
the
very
moment
of
my
disaster
the
enemy
suspecting
our
flight
to
be
only
a
finesse
had
halted
while
only
sixteen
dragoons
under
colonel
camp
continued
the
chase
scorning
to
fly
from
such
a
handful
some
of
my
more
resolute
fellows
thirteen
in
number
faced
about
and
very
deliberately
taking
their
aim
at
the
enemy
as
they
came
up
gave
them
a
which
killed
upwards
of
half
their
number
the
rest
took
to
flight
leaving
their
colonel
whose
horse
was
slain
to
shift
for
himself
which
he
quickly
did
by
running
into
the
woods
the
british
were
so
near
us
when
they
received
the
fire
of
my
men
that
one
of
them
a
stout
fellow
as
he
wheeled
to
go
off
came
so
close
to
me
where
i
stood
on
the
ground
that
he
was
lifting
his
broadsword
for
a
stroke
which
would
probably
have
saved
me
the
trouble
of
writing
this
history
had
i
not
with
one
of
my
pistols
which
i
took
from
the
saddle
when
my
horse
left
me
anticipated
his
kindness
by
driving
a
bullet
through
his
shoulder
which
brought
him
to
the
ground
then
mounting
his
horse
while
my
men
caught
the
horses
of
those
that
were
killed
we
galloped
off
very
well
satisfied
that
the
affair
had
turned
out
no
worse
on
returning
to
marion
i
could
not
help
complaining
to
him
of
my
men
whose
behavior
i
said
in
this
last
affair
had
been
so
very
dastardly
that
i
was
much
afraid
i
should
never
again
put
confidence
in
them
nor
gain
any
credit
by
commanding
them
pshaw
said
he
with
a
smile
it
is
because
you
do
not
understand
the
management
of
them
you
command
militia
it
will
not
do
to
expect
too
much
from
that
sort
of
soldiers
if
on
turning
out
against
the
enemy
you
find
your
men
in
high
spirits
with
burning
eyes
all
kindling
around
you
that
your
time
then
in
close
columns
with
sounding
bugles
and
shining
swords
dash
on
and
i
warrant
your
men
will
follow
you
eager
as
the
lion
whelps
bounding
with
their
sire
to
the
chase
of
the
buffaloes
but
on
the
other
hand
if
by
any
providence
they
get
dismayed
and
begin
to
run
you
are
not
to
fly
in
a
passion
with
them
and
show
yourself
as
mad
as
they
are
cowardly
no
you
must
learn
to
run
too
and
as
fast
as
they
nay
faster
that
you
may
get
into
the
front
and
encourage
them
to
rally
and
as
to
the
credit
that
you
are
to
get
by
commanding
them
i
find
my
dear
fellow
that
you
are
entirely
in
the
wrong
there
also
our
country
can
not
expect
us
to
cope
with
british
regulars
war
is
an
art
the
deepest
of
all
arts
because
the
greatest
of
all
earthly
consequences
depend
on
it
and
none
can
expect
to
be
masters
of
that
terrible
art
but
such
as
serve
a
long
apprenticeship
to
it
but
as
we
have
served
no
apprenticeship
we
can
know
but
little
about
it
in
comparison
with
our
enemies
who
in
discipline
and
experience
have
greatly
the
advantage
of
us
but
thank
god
we
have
our
advantages
too
we
are
far
better
riders
better
woodsmen
and
better
marksmen
than
they
these
are
noble
advantages
let
us
but
improve
them
by
redoubled
activity
and
vigilance
and
kindness
to
our
men
and
especially
by
often
conversing
with
them
on
the
grounds
of
the
war
the
merits
of
our
cause
and
the
vast
consequences
depending
let
us
i
say
in
this
way
make
them
soldiers
in
principle
and
fond
of
their
officers
and
all
will
be
well
yet
by
cutting
off
the
enemy
foraging
parties
drawing
them
into
ambuscades
and
falling
upon
them
by
surprise
we
shall
i
hope
so
harass
and
consume
them
as
to
make
them
glad
to
get
out
of
our
country
and
then
the
performance
of
such
a
noble
act
will
bring
us
credit
and
credit
enough
too
in
the
eyes
of
good
men
while
as
to
ourselves
the
remembrance
of
having
done
so
much
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
man
and
make
posterity
the
happier
for
us
will
afford
us
a
pleasure
that
may
outlive

up
to
the

joy
of

all
partly
on

of
his

which
to
be
sure
was
the
handsomest
we
had
ever
seen
but
much
more
on

of
himself
of
whom
we
had
heard
that
in
deep
art
and
undaunted
courage
he
was
a
second
marion
this
our
high
opinion
of
him
was
greatly
exalted
by
his
own
gallant
conduct
for
he
had
been
with

but
a

days
before

the

were
to

at

points
after
midnight
and
at

signal
from
the
latter
to
commence
the
attack
unfortunately
the
cavalry
did
not
get
up
in
time
owing
to
some
fault
of

the

at
the
appointed
moment

sound
asleep
at

tavern
belonging
to
a
genteel
family
with
whom
they
had
spent
the
evening
with
great
hilarity
a
detachment
of
our
men
approached
the
house
and
surrounded
it
soon
as
the
alarm
was
given
the
officers
leaped
out
of
bed
and
not
waiting
to
dress
flew
into
the
piazza
flourishing
their
pistols
and
shouting
to
the
charge
major
irwin
with
more
courage
than
discretion
fired
a
pistol
and
would
have
tried
another
but
just
as
he
had
cocked
it
he
was
stopped
short
by
the
stroke
of
a
bayonet
which
ended
him
and
his
courage
together
adjutant
crookshanks
acting
in
the
same
heroic
style
would
have
shared
the
same
fate
had
it
not
been
for
an
angel
of
a
young
woman
daughter
of
the
gentleman
of
the
house
this
charming
girl
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
crookshanks
waked
by
the
firing
and
horrid
din
of
battle
in
the
piazza
she
was
at
first
almost
of
her
senses
by
the
fright
but
the
moment
she
heard
her
lover
voice
all
her
terrors
vanished
and
instead
of
hiding
herself
under
the
bedclothes
she
rushed
into
the
piazza
amidst
the
mortal
fray
with
no
armor
but
her
love
no
covering
but
her
flowing
tresses
happily
for
her
lover
she
got
to
him
just
in
time
to
throw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
scream
out
oh
save
save
major
crookshanks
thus
with
her
own
sweet
body
shielding
him
against
the
uplifted
swords
of
her
enraged
countrymen
crookshanks
yielded
himself
our
prisoner
but
we
paroled
him
on
the
spot
and
left
him
to
those
delicious
sentiments
which
he
must
have
felt
in
the
arms
of
an
elegant
young
woman
who
had
saved
his
life
by
an
effort
of
love
sufficient
to
endear
her
to
him
to
all
eternity
it
was
told
us
afterwards
of
this
charming
girl
that
as
soon
as
we
were
gone
and
of
course
the
danger
past
and
the
tumult
of
her
bosom
subsided
she
fell
into
a
swoon
from
which
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
was
recovered
her
extreme
fright
on
being
waked
by
the
firing
and
horrid
uproar
of
battle
in
the
house
and
her
strong
sympathy
in
her
lover
danger
together
with
the
alarm
occasioned
by
finding
herself
in
his
arms
were
too
much
for
her
delicate
frame
there
is
a
beauty
in
generous
actions
which
charms
the
souls
of
men
and
a
sweetness
which
like
that
immortal
love
whence
it
flows
can
never
die
the
eyes
of
all
even
the
poorest
soldiers
in
our
camp
sparkled
with
pleasure
whenever
they
talked
as
they
often
did
of
this
charming
woman
and
of
our
generosity
to
major
crookshanks
and
to
this
day
even
after
a
lapse
of
thirty
years
i
never
think
of
it
but
with
pleasure
a
pleasure
as
exquisite
perhaps
as
what
i
felt
at
the
first
moment
of
that
transaction
and
it
is
a
matter
of
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
think
how
nobly
different
in
this
respect
was
our
conduct
from
that
of
the
british
i
speak
not
of
the
british
nation
which
i
hold
most
magnanimous
but
of
their
officers
in
carolina
such
as
cornwallis
rawdon
tarleton
weymies
brown
and
balfour
who
instead
of
treating
their
prisoners
as
we
did
crookshanks
have
often
been
known
to
butcher
them
in
cold
blood
though
their
fathers
mothers
and
children
on
bended
knees
with
wringing
hands
and
streaming
eyes
have
been
imploring
pity
for
them
there
was
adam
cusac
of
williamsburg
district
this
brave
man
this
buckskin
hampden
that
with
dauntless
breast
the
base
invaders
of
his
rights
withstood
was
surprised
in
his
own
house
by
major
weymies
who
tore
him
away
from
his
shrieking
wife
and
children
marched
him
up
to
cheraw
and
after
exposing
him
to
the
insults
of
a
sham
trial
had
him
condemned
and
hung
the
only
charge
ever
exhibited
against
him
was
that
he
had
shot
across
black
river
at
one
of
weymies
tory
captains
there
was
that
gallant
lad
of
liberty
kit
gales
with
his
brave
companion
sam
dinkins
these
two
heroic
youths
were
dogged
to
the
house
of
a
whig
friend
near
the
hills
of
santee
where
they
were
surprised
in
their
beds
by
a
party
of
tories
who
hurried
them
away
to
lord
rawdon
then
on
his
march
from
charleston
to
camden
rawdon
quickly
had
them
according
to
his
favorite
phrase
knocked
into
irons
and
marched
on
under
guard
with
his
troops
on
halting
for
breakfast
young
gales
was
tucked
up
to
a
tree
and
choked
with
as
little
ceremony
as
if
he
had
been
a
mad
dog
he
and
young
dinkins
had
it
seems
the
day
before
with
their
horses
and
rifles
ventured
alone
so
near
the
british
army
as
to
fire
several
shots
at
them
for
such
heroic
daring
in
defence
of
their
country
in
place
of
receiving
applause
from
lord
rawdon
gales
as
we
have
seen
received
his
bloody
death
his
gallant
young
friend
dinkins
was
very
near
drawing
his
rations
of
a
like
doleful
dish
for
lord
rawdon
had
him
mounted
upon
the
same
cart
with
the
halter
round
his
neck
ready
for
a
launch
into
eternity
when
the
tories
suggested
to
his
lordship
their
serious
apprehensions
that
a
terrible
vengeance
might
follow
this
saved
his
life
everybody
has
heard
the
mournful
story
of
colonel
lee
little
bugler
and
how
he
was
murdered
by
colonel
tarleton
this
poor
beardless
boy
as
lee
in
his
pathetic
account
of
that
horrid
transaction
calls
him
had
been
mounted
on
a
very
fleet
horse
but
to
gratify
a
countryman
who
had
brought
some
news
of
the
british
and
was
afraid
of
falling
into
their
hands
lee
ordered
the
boy
to
exchange
his
horse
a
moment
for
that
of
the
countryman
which
happened
to
be
a
miserable
brute
this
lee
did
in
his
simplicity
not
even
dreaming
that
any
thing
in
the
shape
of
civilized
man
could
think
of
harming
such
a
child
scarcely
had
lee
left
him
when
he
was
overtaken
by
tarleton
troopers
who
dashed
up
to
him
with
looks
of
death
brandishing
their
swords
over
his
head
in
vain
his
tender
cheeks
reminding
them
of
their
own
youthful
brothers
sought
to
touch
their
pity
in
vain
with
feeble
voice
and
as
long
as
he
was
able
he
continued
to
cry
for
quarter
they
struck
their
cruel
swords
into
his
face
and
arms
which
they
gashed
with
so
many
mortal
wounds
that
he
died
the
next
day
is
your
name
wiley
said
one
of
tarleton
captains
whose
name
was
tuck
to
john
wiley
sheriff
of
camden
who
had
lately
whipped
and
cropped
a
noted
horse
thief
named
smart
is
your
name
wiley
said
captain
tuck
to
the
young
man
at
whose
door
he
rode
up
and
asked
the
question
yes
sir
replied
wiley
well
then
sir
you
are
a
d
rascal
rejoined
captain
tuck
giving
him
at
the
same
time
a
cruel
blow
over
the
forehead
with
his
broadsword
young
wiley
though
doomed
to
die
being
not
yet
slain
raised
his
naked
arm
to
screen
the
blow
this
though
no
more
than
a
common
instinct
in
poor
human
nature
in
the
moment
of
terror
served
but
to
redouble
the
fury
of
captain
tuck
who
continued
his
blows
at
the
bleeding
staggering
youth
until
death
kindly
placed
him
beyond
the
reach
of
human
malice
all
this
was
done
within
a
few
hundred
paces
of
lord
cornwallis
who
never
punished
captain
tuck
but
poor
peter
yarnall
case
seems
still
more
deplorable
this
hard
fated
man
a
simple
inoffensive
quaker
lived
near
camden
having
urgent
business
with
a
man
who
as
he
understood
was
with
general
sumter
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
catawba
he
went
over
to
him
the
man
happened
at
that
moment
to
be
keeping
guard
over
some
tory
prisoners
a
paper
which
yarnall
wanted
to
see
was
it
seems
in
a
jacket
pocket
in
the
man
tent
hard
by
hold
my
piece
a
moment
sir
said
he
to
yarnall
and
i
bring
the
paper
yarnall
though
averse
as
a
quaker
from
all
killing
of
enemies
with
a
gun
yet
saw
no
objection
to
holding
one
a
moment
the
next
day
a
day
for
ever
black
in
the
american
calendar
witnessed
the
surprisal
of
general
sumter
and
the
release
of
the
tory
prisoners
one
of
whom
immediately
went
his
way
and
told
colonel
tarleton
that
he
had
seen
peter
yarnall
the
day
before
keeping
guard
over
the
king
friends
prisoners
to
the
rebels
the
poor
man
house
was
quickly
surrounded
by
the
british
cavalry
vain
were
all
his
own
explanations
his
wife
entreaties
or
his
children
cries
he
was
dragged
to
camden
and
thrust
into
prison
every
morning
his
wife
and
daughter
a
girl
of
about
fifteen
rode
into
town
in
an
old
chair
to
see
him
and
to
bring
him
milk
and
fruits
which
must
have
been
highly
acceptable
to
one
crammed
in
the
dogdays
into
a
small
prison
with
one
hundred
and
wretches
on
the
fourth
day
an
amiable
young
lady
miss
charlton
living
near
the
prison
had
heard
of
poor
yarnall
fate
that
morning
soon
therefore
as
she
saw
yarnall
and
her
daughter
coming
along
as
usual
with
their
little
present
to
their
husband
and
father
she
burst
into
tears
yarnall
alighted
at
the
door
of
the
jail
and
begged
to
see
her
husband
follow
me
said
one
of
the
guard
and
i
show
you
your
husband
as
she
turned
the
corner
there
he
is
madam
said
the
soldier
pointing
to
her
husband
as
he
hung
dead
on
a
beam
from
the
window
the
daughter
sunk
to
the
ground
but
her
mother
as
if
petrified
at
the
sight
stood
silent
and
motionless
gazing
on
her
dead
husband
with
that
wild
keen
eye
of
unutterable
woe
which
pierces
all
hearts
presently
as
if
braced
up
with
despair
she
seemed
quite
recovered
and
calmly
begged
one
of
the
soldiers
to
assist
her
to
take
down
the
corpse
and
lay
it
in
the
bottom
of
the
chair
then
taking
her
seat
with
her
daughter
sobbing
by
her
side
and
her
husband
dead
at
her
feet
she
drove
home
apparently
quite
unmoved
and
during
the
whole
time
she
was
preparing
his
coffin
and
performing
the
funeral
duties
she
preserved
the
same
firm
unaltered
looks
but
soon
as
the
grave
had
shut
its
mouth
on
her
husband
and
divorced
him
for
ever
from
her
sight
the
remembrance
of
the
past
rushed
upon
her
thoughts
with
a
weight
too
heavy
for
her
feeble
nature
to
bear
then
clasping
her
hands
in
agony
she
shrieked
out
poor
me
poor
me
i
have
no
husband
no
friend
now
and
immediately
ran
raving
mad
and
died
in
that
state
there
was
young
the
eye
of
humanity
must
weep
often
as
she
turns
the
page
that
tells
how
this
amiable
youth
was
murdered
his
father
was
one
of
the
most
active
of
our
militia
captains
as
none
better
understood
american
rights
so
none
more
deeply
resented
british
aggressions
than
did
captain
his
just
views
and
strong
feelings
were
carefully
instilled
into
his
boy
who
though
but
fifteen
shouldered
his
musket
and
in
spite
of
his
mother
tears
followed
his
father
to
war
many
a
gallant
englishman
received
his
death
at
their
hands
for
being
well
acquainted
with
the
river
and
bravely
supported
by
their
friends
they
often
fired
upon
the
enemy
boats
killing
their
crews
and
intercepting
their
provisions
this
so
enraged
colonel
brown
the
british
commander
at
augusta
that
he
made
several
attempts
to
destroy
captain
once
in
particular
he
despatched
a
captain
and
fifty
men
to
surprise
him
but
kept
so
good
a
look
out
that
he
surprised
and
killed
the
captain
and
twenty
of
his
men
the
rest
by
giving
good
bail
made
their
escape
young
fought
by
the
side
of
his
father
in
this
and
many
other
rencontres
in
one
of
which
he
had
the
great
good
fortune
to
save
his
father
life
at
the
head
of
some
gallant
friends
they
fell
in
with
a
strong
party
of
tories
near
brier
creek
commanded
by
a
british
officer
as
usual
an
obstinate
and
bloody
contest
ensued
the
combatants
quickly
coming
to
close
quarters
grappled
with
the
officer
but
not
possessing
strength
equal
to
his
courage
he
was
overpowered
and
thrown
on
the
ground
the
youth
who
had
just
fired
his
piece
into
the
bosom
of
a
tory
seeing
his
father
danger
flew
to
his
aid
and
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
knocked
out
the
brains
of
the
officer
at
the
very
instant
he
was
lifting
his
dirk
for
the
destruction
of
his
father
in
a
skirmish
in
which
his
party
were
victorious
captain
was
mortally
wounded
and
died
exhorting
his
son
still
to
fight
undauntedly
for
the
liberties
of
his
country
after
the
death
of
his
father
young
joined
the
brave
captain
clarke
in
an
expedition
against
colonel
brown
clarke
was
defeated
and
young
made
prisoner
hearing
of
his
misfortune
his
mother
hastened
to
augusta
but
arrived
only
in
time
to
meet
him
with
colonel
brown
and
a
guard
carrying
him
out
to
the
gallows
with
gushing
tears
she
fell
upon
his
neck
and
bitterly
mourned
her
lot
as
wretched
above
all
women
in
thus
losing
her
husband
and
only
son
the
behavior
of
young
it
is
said
was
heroic
beyond
his
years
instead
of
melting
with
his
disconsolate
mother
he
exhorted
her
like
one
who
had
acted
on
principle
and
now
felt
its
divine
consolations
stronger
than
death
he
entreated
his
mother
not
to
weep
for
him
nor
for
his
father
in
the
course
of
nature
mother
said
he
we
were
to
part
our
parting
indeed
is
early
but
it
is
glorious
my
father
was
like
a
lion
in
battle
for
his
country
as
a
young
lion
i
fought
by
his
side
and
often
when
the
battle
was
over
did
he
embrace
and
call
me
his
boy
his
own
brave
boy
and
said
i
was
worthy
of
you
both
he
has
just
gone
before
and
i
now
follow
him
leaving
you
the
joy
to
remember
that
your
son
and
husband
have
attained
the
highest
honor
on
earth
the
honor
of
fighting
and
dying
for
the
rights
of
man
anxious
to
save
the
life
of
so
dear
a
son
poor
fell
on
her
knees
to
colonel
brown
and
with
all
the
widowed
mother
agonizing
in
her
looks
plead
for
his
life
but
in
vain
with
the
dark
features
of
a
soul
horribly
triumphant
over
the
cries
of
mercy
he
repulsed
her
suit
and
ordered
the
executioner
to
do
his
office
he
hung
up
the
young
man
before
the
eyes
of
his
mother
and
then
with
savage
joy
suffered
his
indians
in
her
presence
to
strike
their
tomahawks
into
his
forehead
that
forehead
which
she
had
so
often
pressed
to
her
bosom
and
kissed
with
all
the
transports
of
a
doting
mother
who
without
tears
can
think
of
the
hard
fate
of
poor
colonel
haynes
and
his
family
soon
as
the
will
of
heaven
had
thrown
charleston
into
the
hands
of
the
british
lord
cornwallis
famed
for
pompous
proclamations
began
to
publish
the
tenor
of
his
gasconade
was
that
carolina
was
now
to
all
intents
and
purposes
subjugated
that
the
enemies
of
his
lord
the
king
were
all
at
his
mercy
and
that
though
by
the
war
rubrick
for
conquered
rebels
he
had
a
right
to
send
fire
and
sword
before
him
with
blood
and
tears
following
in
his
course
though
he
had
a
right
to
feed
the
birds
of
heaven
with
rebel
carcasses
and
to
fatten
his
soldiers
with
their
confiscated
goods
yet
he
meant
not
to
use
that
dreadful
right
no
indeed
far
from
him
were
all
such
odious
thoughts
on
the
contrary
he
wished
to
be
merciful
and
as
proof
of
his
sincerity
all
that
he
asked
of
the
poor
deluded
people
of
his
majesty
colony
of
south
carolina
was
that
they
should
no
longer
take
part
nor
lot
in
the
contest
but
continue
peaceably
at
their
homes
and
that
in
reward
thereof
they
should
be
most
sacredly
protected
in
property
and
person
this
proclamation
was
accompanied
with
an
instrument
of
neutrality
as
an
outward
and
visible
sign
of
an
inward
and
spiritual
grace
in
my
lord
cornwallis
towards
the
carolinians
and
which
instrument
they
were
invited
to
sign
that
they
might
have
a
covenant
right
to
the
aforesaid
promised
blessings
of
protection
both
in
property
and
person
the
heart
of
colonel
haynes
was
with
his
countrymen
and
fervently
did
he
pray
that
his
hands
could
be
with
them
too
but
these
alas
were
bound
up
by
his
wife
and
children
whom
it
is
said
he
loved
passing
well
helpless
and
trembling
as
they
were
how
could
they
be
deserted
by
him
in
this
fearful
season
and
given
up
to
a
brutal
soldiery
and
why
should
he
insure
the
destruction
of
a
large
estate
when
all
opposition
seemed
hopeless
in
short
with
thousands
of
others
he
went
and
signed
an
instrument
which
promised
security
to
his
family
and
fortune
but
alas
from
that
fatal
moment
he
never
more
enjoyed
peace
to
hate
the
ministerial
measures
as
he
did
and
yet
thus
tamely
to
have
submitted
to
them
to
love
his
country
as
heartily
as
he
did
and
to
know
that
she
was
now
fighting
with
her
all
at
stake
and
yet
thus
to
have
deserted
her
these
keen
reflections
harrowed
every
root
of
quiet
from
his
soul
if
he
went
to
his
couch
it
was
only
to
groan
sleepless
and
tossing
all
the
restless
night
if
he
got
up
it
was
but
to
sit
or
walk
to
and
fro
in
his
family
with
dark
and
woeful
looks
like
one
whom
trouble
had
overcome
in
the
midst
of
these
anguishing
reflections
which
appeared
to
be
wearing
him
fast
to
the
grave
a
respite
was
afforded
and
by
a
hand
from
which
it
was
least
expected
lord
cornwallis
having
by
his
first
proclamation
obtained
to
the
instrument
of
neutrality
aforesaid
the
signatures
of
many
thousands
of
the
citizens
of
south
carolina
then
came
out
with
a
second
proclamation
in
which
he
nominates
the
paper
above
not
an
instrument
of
neutrality
but
a
bond
of
allegiance
to
the
king
and
calls
upon
all
who
had
signed
it
to
take
up
arms
against
the
rebels
threatening
to
treat
as
deserters
those
who
refused
this
fraud
of
my
lord
cornwallis
excited
in
all
honest
men
the
deepest
indignation
it
completely
revived
colonel
haynes
to
his
unspeakable
joy
he
now
saw
opened
a
door
of
honorable
return
to
duty
and
happiness
and
since
contrary
to
the
most
solemn
compact
he
was
compelled
to
fight
he
very
naturally
determined
to
fight
the
british
rather
than
his
own
countrymen
he
fled
to
his
countrymen
who
received
him
with
joy
and
gave
him
a
command
of
horse
he
was
surprised
and
carried
to
charleston
where
lord
rawdon
then
commandant
ordered
him
in
his
favorite
phrase
to
be
into
irons
a
mock
trial
dignified
with
the
name
of
martial
was
held
over
him
and
colonel
haynes
was
sentenced
to
be
hung
everybody
in
charleston
britons
as
well
as
americans
all
heard
this
sentence
with
horror
except
colonel
haynes
himself
on
his
cheek
alone
all
agree
it
produced
no
change
it
appeared
that
the
deed
which
he
had
done
signing
that
accursed
paper
had
run
him
desperate
though
the
larger
part
even
of
his
enemies
believing
that
it
was
done
merely
from
sympathy
with
his
wife
and
children
felt
the
generous
disposition
to
forgive
him
yet
he
could
never
forgive
himself
it
had
inflicted
on
his
mind
a
wound
too
ghastly
to
be
healed
to
their
own
and
to
the
great
honor
of
human
nature
numbers
of
the
british
and
loyalists
with
governor
bull
at
their
head
preferred
a
petition
to
lord
rawdon
in
his
behalf
but
the
petition
was
not
noticed
the
ladies
then
came
forward
in
his
favor
with
a
petition
couched
in
the
most
delicate
and
moving
terms
and
signed
by
all
the
principal
females
of
charleston
tories
as
well
as
whigs
but
all
to
no
purpose
it
was
then
suggested
by
the
friends
of
humanity
that
if
the
colonel
little
children
for
they
had
no
mother
she
poor
woman
crushed
under
the
double
weight
of
grief
and
the
was
just
sunk
at
rest
in
the
grave
it
was
suggested
i
say
that
if
the
colonel
little
children
dressed
in
mourning
were
to
fall
at
the
knees
of
lord
rawdon
he
would
pity
their
motherless
condition
and
give
to
their
prayers
their
only
surviving
parent
they
were
accordingly
dressed
in
black
and
introduced
into
his
presence
they
fell
down
at
his
knees
and
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
lisped
their
father
name
and
begged
his
life
but
in
vain
so
many
efforts
to
save
him
both
by
friends
and
generous
foes
could
not
be
made
unknown
to
colonel
haynes
but
he
appeared
perfectly
indifferent
about
the
result
and
when
told
that
they
had
all
failed
he
replied
with
the
utmost
unconcern
well
thank
god
lord
rawdon
can
not
hurt
me
he
can
not
be
more
anxious
to
take
my
life
than
i
am
to
lay
it
down
with
his
son
a
youth
of
thirteen
who
was
permitted
to
stay
with
him
in
the
prison
colonel
haynes
used
often
to
converse
in
order
to
fortify
him
against
the
sad
trial
that
was
at
hand
and
indeed
it
was
necessary
for
seldom
has
a
heavier
load
been
laid
on
a
youth
war
like
a
thick
cloud
had
darkened
up
the
gay
morning
of
his
days
the
grave
had
just
closed
her
mouth
on
a
mother
who
doted
on
him
and
he
now
beheld
his
only
parent
a
beloved
father
in
the
power
of
his
enemies
loaded
with
irons
and
condemned
to
die
with
cheeks
wet
with
tears
he
sat
continually
by
his
father
side
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
so
piercing
and
sad
as
often
wrung
tears
of
blood
from
his
heart
why
said
he
my
son
will
you
thus
break
your
father
heart
with
unavailing
sorrow
have
i
not
often
told
you
that
we
came
into
this
world
but
to
prepare
for
a
better
for
that
better
life
my
dear
boy
your
father
is
prepared
instead
then
of
weeping
rejoice
with
me
my
son
that
my
troubles
are
so
near
an
end
i
set
out
for
immortality
you
will
accompany
me
to
the
place
of
my
execution
and
when
i
am
dead
take
and
bury
me
by
the
side
of
your
mother
the
youth
here
fell
on
his
father
neck
crying
oh
my
father
my
father
i
will
die
with
you
i
will
die
with
you
colonel
haynes
would
have
returned
the
strong
embrace
of
his
son
but
alas
his
hands
were
loaded
with
irons
live
said
he
my
son
live
to
honor
god
by
a
good
life
live
to
serve
your
country
and
live
to
take
care
of
your
brother
and
little
sisters
the
next
morning
colonel
haynes
was
conducted
to
the
place
of
execution
his
son
accompanied
him
soon
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
gallows
the
father
strengthened
himself
and
said
now
my
son
show
yourself
a
man
that
tree
is
the
boundary
of
my
life
and
of
all
my
life
sorrows
beyond
that
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
do
lay
too
much
to
heart
our
separation
from
you
it
will
be
but
short
was
but
lately
your
dear
mother
died
i
die
and
you
my
son
though
but
young
must
shortly
follow
us
yes
my
father
replied
the
youth
i
shall
shortly
follow
you
for
indeed
i
feel
that
i
can
not
live
long
and
so
it
happened
unto
him
for
on
seeing
his
father
in
the
hands
of
the
executioner
and
then
struggling
in
the
halter
he
stood
like
one
transfixed
and
motionless
with
horror
till
then
he
had
wept
incessantly
but
soon
as
he
saw
that
sight
the
fountain
of
his
tears
was
staunched
and
he
never
wept
more
it
was
thought
that
grief
like
a
fever
burnt
inwardly
and
scorched
his
brain
for
he
became
indifferent
to
every
thing
around
him
and
often
wandered
as
one
disordered
in
his
mind
at
times
he
took
lessons
from
a
fencing
master
and
talked
of
going
to
england
to
fight
the
murderer
of
his
father
but
he
who
made
him
had
pity
on
him
and
sent
death
to
his
relief
he
died
insane
and
in
his
last
moments
often
called
on
the
name
of
his
father
in
terms
that
brought
tears
from
the
hardest
hearts
i
hope
my
reader
will
not
suppose
from
these
odious
truths
which
i
have
been
telling
him
about
the
british
and
tories
that
i
look
on
them
as
worse
than
other
men
or
that
i
would
have
him
bear
an
eternal
hatred
against
them
no
god
forbid
on
the
contrary
i
have
no
doubt
on
my
mind
that
the
british
and
tories
are
men
of
the
same
passions
with
ourselves
and
i
also
as
firmly
believe
that
if
placed
in
their
circumstances
we
should
have
acted
just
as
they
did
upon
honor
this
is
my
conviction
now
but
it
was
not
always
so
for
i
confess
there
was
a
time
when
i
had
my
prejudices
against
them
and
prejudices
too
as
strong
as
those
of
any
other
man
let
him
be
who
he
would
but
thank
god
those
prejudices
so
dishonorable
to
the
head
and
so
uneasy
to
the
heart
are
done
away
from
me
now
and
from
this
most
happy
deliverance
i
am
through
the
divine
goodness
principally
indebted
to
my
honored
friend
general
marion
of
whose
noble
sentiments
on
these
subjects
i
beg
leave
to
give
the
reader
some
little
specimen
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
short
and
sweet
or
a
curious
dialogue
between
general
marion
and
captain
snipes
on
retaliation
no
radiant
pearls
that
crested
fortune
wears
no
gem
that
sparkling
hangs
in
beauty
ears
not
the
bright
stars
that
night
blue
arch
adorn
nor
opening
suns
that
gild
the
vernal
morn
shine
with
such
lustre
as
the
tear
that
flows
down
virtue
manly
cheeks
for
others
woes
what
gigantic
form
is
that
which
stalks
thus
awfully
before
the
eyes
of
my
memory
his
face
rough
and
dark
as
the
cloud
of
winter
and
his
eyeballs
burning
like
coals
of
fire
is
the
impetuous
captain
snipes
he
is
just
returned
from
the
quarter
house
near
charleston
where
he
and
captain
with
macdonald
and
forty
men
have
recently
surprised
and
cut
to
pieces
a
large
party
of
the
enemy
he
looks
as
if
the
fury
of
the
battle
had
not
yet
subsided
in
his
wrathful
countenance
his
steps
are
towards
marion
and
as
he
presents
a
packet
he
exclaims
in
an
angry
tone
there
sir
is
a
charleston
paper
you
see
there
how
those
villains
are
going
on
yet
not
satisfied
with
all
the
murders
they
had
committed
before
they
have
gone
now
and
murdered
colonel
haynes
here
he
gave
the
heads
of
that
disgraceful
act
seasoning
his
speech
every
now
and
then
as
he
went
along
with
sundry
very
bitter
imprecations
on
lord
rawdon
ah
shame
shame
upon
him
replied
the
general
with
a
sigh
and
shaking
his
head
shame
upon
lord
rawdon
shame
answered
captain
snipes
his
eyes
flashing
fire
shame
i
hope
something
heavier
than
shame
will
light
upon
him
for
it
soon
the
american
officers
have
sworn
never
again
to
give
quarter
to
the
british
or
tories
marion
god
forbid
that
my
countrymen
should
have
taken
such
an
oath
as
that
snipes
why
general
marion
would
you
have
the
enemy
go
on
at
this
rate
and
we
take
no
revenge
revenge
o
yes
to
be
sure
sir
revenge
is
sweet
and
by
all
means
let
us
have
it
but
let
it
be
of
the
right
kind
of
the
right
kind
sir
what
do
you
call
revenge
of
the
right
kind
why
sir
i
am
for
taking
that
kind
of
revenge
which
will
make
our
enemies
ashamed
of
their
conduct
and
abandon
it
for
ever
ashamed
of
their
conduct
monsters
they
are
not
capable
of
shame
pshaw
do
talk
so
captain
snipes
our
enemies
sir
are
men
and
just
such
men
as
we
are
and
as
capable
of
generous
actions
if
we
will
but
show
them
the
way
well
then
general
marion
how
do
you
account
for
that
great
difference
between
us
and
them
in
point
of
spirits
we
have
never
yet
killed
any
of
their
men
except
in
fair
fight
that
i
have
heard
of
but
they
have
often
murdered
ours
yes
the
cowardly
rascals
they
have
often
done
it
and
that
in
cold
blood
too
granted
and
i
am
very
glad
that
when
we
have
had
them
in
our
power
we
have
always
treated
them
so
much
more
generously
but
i
suppose
the
reason
of
such
barbarity
on
their
part
is
they
have
had
or
which
is
the
same
thing
have
thought
they
had
greater
provocations
they
be
d
they
and
their
provocations
too
are
not
we
the
persons
who
have
been
invaded
and
plundered
and
murdered
by
them
and
not
they
by
us
how
then
can
they
have
greater
provocations
why
sir
sprung
originally
from
them
and
always
looked
on
by
them
as
their
children
our
turning
now
and
fighting
against
them
must
appear
in
their
sight
a
very
great
provocation
as
great
perhaps
as
that
of
children
fighting
against
their
parents
and
again
our
shaking
off
what
they
glory
in
as
the
wisest
and
freest
and
happiest
government
on
earth
must
make
us
seem
to
them
as
no
better
than
the
vilest
traitors
and
rebels
which
can
not
otherwise
than
prove
another
very
great
provocation
and
again
after
having
been
first
settled
in
this
country
by
them
as
they
will
have
it
and
afterwards
so
long
and
liberally
assisted
with
their
best
blood
and
treasure
in
hope
that
some
day
or
other
we
should
be
of
service
to
them
that
now
at
the
very
time
when
by
our
immense
population
we
were
just
arrived
to
the
so
long
desired
point
to
swell
their
wealth
and
spread
their
commerce
and
arms
over
the
world
we
should
separate
from
them
blast
all
their
fond
hopes
and
throw
them
back
to
the
former
level
this
i
say
you
will
certainly
allow
must
be
a
very
severe
provocation
now
sir
putting
all
these
provocations
together
and
also
taking
poor
human
nature
into
the
account
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
british
should
be
so
much
more
angry
and
consequently
more
violent
than
we
why
certainly
general
marion
you
have
always
a
very
fine
knack
of
setting
off
your
arguments
but
still
sir
i
ca
see
things
in
that
light
for
a
man
sir
to
go
and
trump
up
a
pack
of
claims
against
me
and
all
of
them
because
i
ca
credit
him
in
the
abominable
extent
he
wishes
to
fall
upon
me
and
kill
and
murder
me
as
the
british
and
tories
have
done
with
us
and
we
not
stop
them
by
revenge
why
my
god
sir
it
will
never
do
for
at
this
rate
whom
shall
we
have
living
in
all
this
country
in
a
little
time
but
the
british
and
their
friends
the
tories
and
negroes
my
brave
captain
let
me
tell
you
again
i
am
as
anxious
to
stop
them
as
you
can
possibly
wish
me
to
be
but
i
am
for
doing
it
in
what
i
think
the
right
way
i
mean
the
way
of
policy
and
humanity
policy
sir
can
there
be
policy
in
letting
our
best
men
be
murdered
by
these
savages
i
sure
general
washington
did
not
think
so
for
though
i
am
no
man
of
learning
myself
yet
i
have
been
told
by
those
that
are
that
on
its
being
threatened
by
general
gage
to
hang
an
american
soldier
he
instantly
wrote
him
word
that
if
he
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
the
life
of
a
british
soldier
should
pay
for
it
and
it
is
well
known
that
he
kept
the
british
army
and
nation
too
in
a
fright
for
three
months
together
with
the
halter
constantly
around
the
neck
of
captain
asgil
expecting
every
day
to
be
hung
for
the
murder
of
captain
huddy
true
general
washington
did
act
so
and
it
was
policy
to
act
against
a
foreign
enemy
but
our
standing
with
the
tories
is
quite
a
different
case
and
requires
a
very
different
course
the
tories
are
our
countrymen
a
part
of
our
own
population
and
strength
so
that
every
man
of
them
that
is
killed
is
a
man
forever
lost
to
ourselves
now
since
the
british
have
put
them
up
to
murder
us
if
we
go
out
of
revenge
to
murder
them
again
why
in
the
course
of
a
little
time
our
population
will
be
so
cut
up
as
to
allow
the
british
ministry
with
ease
to
take
our
country
and
make
slaves
of
us
all
which
is
just
what
lord
north
desires
yes
i
dare
say
it
is
but
i
hope
he
be
disappointed
yet
no
doubt
of
it
sir
if
we
shall
be
wise
and
magnanimous
enough
to
follow
the
true
policy
which
is
no
other
than
humanity
to
these
deluded
people
the
tories
and
to
this
we
have
every
inducement
that
generous
spirits
could
desire
the
tories
and
ourselves
are
brothers
many
of
us
went
to
the
same
school
together
and
a
thousand
times
have
ate
and
drank
in
each
other
houses
and
as
to
the
quarrel
in
which
we
are
now
unfortunately
engaged
though
not
the
most
still
we
are
much
in
fault
we
made
no
allowances
for
those
follies
of
theirs
which
led
to
it
they
thought
first
that
we
were
too
nearly
allied
to
england
to
go
to
war
with
her
this
was
a
weakness
but
there
was
something
amiable
in
it
secondly
they
thought
the
british
were
much
too
warlike
and
powerful
to
be
resisted
by
us
this
was
an
error
but
it
was
learned
in
the
nursery
thirdly
they
wished
to
keep
in
with
the
british
merely
that
they
might
save
their
property
this
was
altogether
from
fear
and
therefore
claimed
some
commiseration
but
no
we
could
not
grant
one
grain
of
indulgence
to
any
of
their
mistakes
we
would
have
it
they
all
proceeded
from
the
vilest
of
motives
we
called
them
traitors
and
cowards
and
scoundrels
and
loaded
them
with
a
thousand
indignities
besides
well
the
consequences
were
as
might
have
been
expected
from
human
weakness
and
passion
wrought
to
desperation
and
caring
not
what
they
did
they
have
gone
and
joined
our
enemies
and
many
valuable
lives
have
been
lost
on
both
sides
surely
is
high
time
now
that
we
should
set
about
doing
something
to
end
it
well
let
them
set
about
ending
it
themselves
they
were
the
first
to
begin
it
but
would
you
have
the
tories
to
lead
to
glory
glory
i
should
think
it
meanness
to
be
the
first
to
make
overtures
to
such
rascals
well
but
captain
snipes
when
brethren
as
we
are
fall
out
is
it
policy
to
go
on
to
exasperate
and
cut
each
other
throats
until
our
enemy
comes
and
takes
away
a
fine
country
of
which
by
such
madness
we
had
rendered
ourselves
unworthy
would
it
not
be
much
better
policy
to
trace
back
all
our
wrong
steps
of
passion
and
revenge
and
making
hearty
friends
again
and
joining
our
forces
against
the
common
enemy
drive
him
out
of
our
country
and
then
by
establishing
a
free
government
and
encouraging
agriculture
and
commerce
and
learning
and
religion
make
ourselves
a
great
and
happy
people
again
would
not
this
i
say
be
the
true
policy
why
yes
i
confess
general
marion
it
would
be
a
noble
thing
and
very
desirable
if
it
could
be
done
but
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
being
the
first
to
make
terms
with
the
tories
after
they
have
been
burning
and
plundering
and
murdering
our
best
friends
it
is
too
hard
sir
for
mortal
flesh
and
blood
it
is
a
great
trial
i
confess
but
the
heavier
the
cross
the
brighter
the
crown
you
know
sir
and
as
to
the
difficulty
of
the
undertaking
that
the
very
thing
that
should
make
us
jump
at
it
the
glory
of
showing
ourselves
wiser
and
better
men
than
our
enemy
and
besides
let
us
recollect
that
the
glory
of
this
exploit
all
now
lies
with
us
for
if
we
do
not
pluck
up
courage
and
do
it
it
will
never
be
done
the
tories
are
generally
an
ignorant
people
and
therefore
not
much
of
wise
or
good
is
to
be
expected
from
that
quarter
they
have
also
in
many
instances
acted
a
very
savage
part
by
us
their
consciousness
of
this
can
have
no
tendency
to
make
them
court
reconciliation
with
us
since
then
but
little
is
to
be
expected
from
them
it
seems
incumbent
on
us
to
do
the
more
we
have
better
information
and
we
have
also
a
much
better
cause
these
are
great
advantages
which
god
has
given
us
and
now
it
becomes
us
to
improve
them
to
his
glory
and
to
our
own
honor
by
showing
a
conciliatory
and
magnanimous
spirit
towards
our
enemies
and
though
it
should
cost
us
labor
to
win
such
a
victory
yet
i
am
confident
that
when
won
it
will
appear
to
us
the
most
glorious
that
we
ever
achieved
to
conquer
an
enemy
by
the
sword
is
no
doubt
honorable
but
still
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
of
conquering
him
by
generosity
as
arguing
both
superior
virtue
and
courage
it
commands
higher
admiration
from
the
world
and
is
reflected
on
by
ourselves
with
far
more
and
applause
and
then
sir
only
consider
how
such
conduct
will
gild
the
future
scenes
of
life
this
unfortunate
quarrel
betwixt
us
and
our
countrymen
the
tories
is
not
to
last
forever
it
was
only
the
act
of
a
wicked
ministry
attempting
by
an
unconstitutional
tax
to
enslave
an
affectionate
part
of
the
nation
god
can
never
suffer
such
an
attempt
to
prosper
it
must
be
but
a
momentary
quarrel
and
we
ought
to
accustom
ourselves
to
think
of
it
as
such
and
to
look
beyond
it
to
the
happy
days
that
are
to
succeed
and
since
the
storm
of
war
is
soon
to
subside
into
the
calm
of
peace
let
us
do
nothing
now
that
may
throw
a
cloud
over
the
coming
sunshine
let
us
not
even
talk
of
war
that
unnatural
crime
which
would
harrow
up
our
souls
with
the
pangs
of
remorse
and
haunt
our
repose
with
the
dread
of
retaliation
which
would
draw
down
upon
our
cause
the
curse
of
heaven
and
make
our
very
name
the
odium
of
all
generations
but
far
differently
let
us
act
the
generous
part
of
those
who
though
now
at
variance
are
yet
brothers
and
soon
to
be
good
friends
again
and
then
when
peace
returns
we
shall
be
in
proper
frame
to
enjoy
it
no
poor
woman
that
we
meet
will
seem
to
upbraid
us
for
the
slaughter
of
her
husband
no
naked
child
for
robbing
him
of
his
father
no
field
will
cry
against
us
for
a
brother
blood
on
the
contrary
whenever
the
battles
which
we
are
now
fighting
shall
recur
to
our
thoughts
with
the
frightened
enemy
grounding
their
arms
and
crying
for
quarter
we
shall
remember
how
we
heard
their
cries
and
stopped
the
uplifted
sword
joy
will
spring
in
our
bosoms
and
all
around
will
smile
with
approbation
the
faces
of
the
aged
will
shine
upon
us
because
we
spared
their
sons
females
will
bless
us
for
their
surviving
husbands
and
even
the
lips
of
the
children
will
lisp
our
praises
thus
with
a
heaven
of
delighted
feeling
in
our
hearts
and
the
smiles
both
of
god
and
man
on
our
heads
we
shall
pass
the
evening
of
our
days
in
glorious
peace
and
when
death
shall
call
us
to
that
better
world
we
shall
obey
without
reluctance
conscious
of
neither
dread
nor
hate
towards
any
of
the
blessed
people
that
dwell
there
we
shall
go
in
strong
hope
of
witnessing
the
bright
realities
of
that
state
where
all
is
immortality
and
love
perhaps
we
shall
there
meet
many
of
those
whom
it
has
been
our
sad
destiny
to
fight
with
here
not
in
their
present
imperfect
state
but
in
their
state
of
exaltation
clad
in
robes
brighter
than
the
stars
and
their
faces
outshining
the
sun
in
his
noonday
splendors
perhaps
at
sight
of
us
these
glorious
spirits
may
rush
with
beauties
to
embrace
us
and
in
the
presence
of
crowding
angels
recount
our
kindness
to
them
in
the
days
of
their
mortality
while
all
the
dazzling
throngs
listening
delighted
shall
fix
on
us
their
eyes
of
love
inspiring
those
joys
which
none
but
strong
immortals
could
sustain
are
not
these
o
my
friends
hopes
worth
contending
for
is
revenge
to
be
cherished
that
would
rob
us
of
such
honors
can
generosity
be
dear
that
would
ensure
to
us
such
so
great
rewards
then
let
us
not
think
benevolence
was
enjoined
in
vain
which
is
to
conduct
us
to
such
immortal
felicities
as
marion
spoke
these
words
his
countenance
which
in
general
was
melancholy
caught
an
animation
beyond
the
reader
fancy
to
conceive
the
charms
of
goodness
and
the
bright
rewards
which
await
it
were
painted
in
such
living
colors
on
his
face
that
not
even
the
stranger
could
have
beheld
it
unmoved
on
me
who
almost
adored
marion
for
his
godlike
virtues
its
effects
were
past
describing
my
bosom
heaved
with
emotions
unutterable
while
the
tear
of
delicious
admiration
swelled
in
my
eyes
as
to
captain
snipes
he
appeared
equally
affected
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
general
and
towards
the
close
of
the
speech
his
breath
seemed
suspended
his
color
went
and
came
and
his
face
reddened
and
swelled
as
under
the
powerful
eloquence
of
the
pulpit
chapter
marion
and
lee
attack
and
take
fort
watson
and
fort
motte
interesting
anecdotes
from
georgetown
marion
proceeded
with
colonel
lee
to
attack
the
british
post
on
scott
lake
generally
called
fort
watson
the
situation
of
this
fort
was
romantic
and
beautiful
in
the
extreme
overlooking
the
glassy
level
of
the
lake
it
stood
on
a
mighty
barrow
or
tomb
like
a
mount
formed
of
the
bones
of
indian
nations
there
heaped
up
from
time
immemorial
and
covered
with
earth
and
herbage
finding
that
the
fort
mounted
no
artillery
marion
resolved
to
make
his
approaches
in
a
way
that
should
give
his
riflemen
a
fair
chance
against
their
musqueteers
for
this
purpose
large
quantities
of
pine
logs
were
cut
and
as
soon
as
dark
came
on
were
carried
in
perfect
silence
within
point
blank
shot
of
the
fort
and
run
up
in
the
shape
of
large
pens
or
considerably
higher
than
the
enemy
parapets
great
no
doubt
was
the
consternation
of
the
garrison
next
morning
to
see
themselves
thus
suddenly
overlooked
by
this
strange
kind
of
steeple
pouring
down
upon
them
from
its
blazing
top
incessant
showers
of
rifle
bullets
nor
were
they
idle
the
while
but
returned
the
blaze
with
equal
fury
presenting
to
us
who
lay
at
a
distance
a
very
interesting
scene
as
of
two
volcanoes
that
had
suddenly
broke
out
into
fiery
strife
singeing
the
neighboring
pines
though
their
enemy
yet
i
could
not
but
pity
the
british
when
i
saw
the
great
disadvantage
under
which
they
fought
for
our
riflemen
lying
above
them
and
firing
through
loopholes
were
seldom
hurt
while
the
british
obliged
every
time
they
fired
to
show
their
heads
were
frequently
killed
increasing
still
the
awkwardness
of
their
situation
their
well
which
was
on
the
outside
of
the
fort
was
so
entirely
in
the
reach
of
our
rifles
that
they
could
not
get
a
pail
of
water
for
coffee
or
grog
without
the
utmost
hazard
after
a
gallant
resistance
they
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
of
war
one
hundred
and
twenty
in
number
this
fort
had
been
very
judiciously
fixed
in
a
country
exceedingly
fertile
and
on
a
lake
abounding
with
fine
fish
and
from
its
contiguity
to
the
river
santee
forming
an
admirable
deposite
for
their
upland
posts
from
their
military
storehouse
which
was
on
the
outside
of
the
fort
the
british
attempted
at
the
commencement
of
our
attack
to
get
out
their
goods
and
to
roll
them
up
into
the
fort
but
in
this
exposed
state
their
men
were
picked
off
so
fast
by
our
sharpshooters
that
they
were
soon
obliged
to
quit
such
hot
work
the
sight
of
their
casks
and
bales
rolled
out
and
shining
so
richly
on
the
side
of
the
hill
set
the
fingers
of
our
ragged
on
such
an
itch
that
there
was
no
resisting
it
and
presently
a
squad
of
three
of
them
were
seen
pushing
out
without
leave
or
license
to
attack
a
large
hogshead
that
lay
very
invitingly
on
the
outside
of
the
rest
the
enemy
seeing
the
approach
of
our
buccaneers
reserved
their
fire
until
they
had
got
pretty
near
up
to
the
intended
prize
then
all
at
once
cut
loose
upon
them
with
a
thundering
clap
which
killed
one
crippled
a
second
and
so
frightened
the
third
that
he
forgot
the
cask
and
turning
tail
thought
of
nothing
but
to
save
his
bacon
which
he
did
by
such
extraordinary
running
and
jumping
as
threw
us
all
into
a
most
immoderate
laugh
presently
up
comes
my
black
waiter
billy
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
and
says
why
master
them
militia
men
there
sir
are
tarnal
fools
they
do
not
know
nothing
at
all
about
stealing
but
if
you
will
please
sir
to
let
me
try
my
hand
i
can
fetch
off
that
hogshead
there
mighty
easy
sir
no
no
billy
said
i
shaking
my
head
that
will
never
do
my
lad
i
value
you
much
too
highly
billy
to
let
you
be
knocked
on
the
head
so
foolishly
as
all
that
comes
to
lord
bless
you
sir
replied
he
smiling
there
is
no
more
danger
in
it
than
in
eating
when
a
body
is
hungry
and
if
you
will
only
please
let
me
try
my
hand
sir
if
you
see
any
danger
why
then
master
you
may
call
me
back
you
know
sir
upon
this
he
started
fortunately
for
him
our
riflemen
seeing
what
he
was
after
made
a
noble
diversion
in
his
favor
by
throwing
a
galling
fire
into
the
fort
on
getting
within
thirty
yards
of
the
hogshead
he
fell
flat
on
his
face
and
dragged
himself
along
on
his
belly
until
he
reached
it
then
seizing
the
hogshead
with
a
hand
on
each
chine
he
worked
it
backwards
and
backwards
like
an
alligator
pulling
a
dog
into
the
river
until
he
had
fairly
rolled
his
prize
to
the
brink
of
the
hill
where
giving
it
a
sudden
jerk
by
way
of
a
start
and
at
the
same
time
jumping
up
he
ran
with
all
his
might
down
the
precipice
the
hogshead
hard
after
him
and
was
soon
out
of
all
danger
numbers
of
shots
were
fired
at
him
but
not
one
touched
him
which
gave
great
joy
to
our
encampment
who
were
all
anxious
spectators
of
the
transaction
and
seemed
to
take
a
deep
interest
in
billy
success
and
no
wonder
for
he
was
a
most
fellow
and
exceedingly
useful
in
camp
officers
or
soldiers
cadets
or
colonels
no
matter
who
they
were
that
asked
billy
a
favor
they
were
sure
to
have
it
done
for
them
and
with
such
a
cheerful
air
as
did
them
more
good
than
the
service
itself
so
that
i
much
question
whether
there
was
a
man
in
all
our
camp
whose
good
luck
would
have
given
more
general
satisfaction
than
his
on
opening
billy
hogshead
which
indeed
was
no
hogshead
but
rather
a
puncheon
as
big
as
two
hogsheads
there
was
a
prodigious
stare
among
our
men
at
the
sight
of
so
much
wealth
strong
white
shirts
for
soldiers
fine
do
do
for
officers
camp
blankets
black
stocks
knapsacks
and
dragoon
cloaks
were
the
valuable
contents
of
billy
cask
the
native
genius
of
the
poor
fellow
instantly
broke
out
in
a
stream
of
generous
actions
which
never
stopped
until
the
hogshead
was
completely
emptied
first
of
all
he
began
with
me
to
whom
he
presented
half
a
dozen
of
the
fine
shirts
and
black
stocks
with
a
dragoon
cloak
then
to
the
general
he
made
a
present
also
to
the
officers
of
his
family
to
his
who
messed
with
him
he
gave
two
shirts
but
what
pleased
me
most
in
billy
donations
was
his
generosity
to
the
two
men
who
had
miscarried
in
their
attempt
on
the
same
cask
seeing
that
they
were
much
mortified
at
their
own
failure
and
a
little
perhaps
at
his
success
he
desired
them
to
come
and
help
themselves
to
what
they
liked
hearing
him
then
express
a
wish
that
he
knew
what
to
do
with
the
balance
i
told
him
that
many
of
our
dragoons
were
poor
men
and
much
in
want
of
shirts
aye
sure
enough
said
he
and
immediately
handed
them
out
a
shirt
until
all
were
gone
for
this
generosity
of
billy
general
marion
dubbed
him
captain
billy
a
name
which
he
went
by
ever
afterwards
nothing
was
ever
more
seasonable
than
this
supply
purchased
by
billy
valor
for
before
that
we
were
all
as
ragged
as
young
rooks
there
was
not
an
officer
in
camp
except
colonel
lee
and
his
staff
who
was
so
rich
as
to
own
two
shirts
i
am
very
sure
that
marion
aids
had
but
one
and
yet
so
independent
of
wealth
is
cheerfulness
that
i
have
often
seen
our
officers
in
their
naked
buffs
near
a
branch
singing
and
dancing
around
their
shirts
which
they
had
just
washed
and
hung
on
the
bushes
to
dry
from
the
reduction
of
fort
watson
we
set
out
immediately
in
high
spirits
for
the
still
nobler
attack
on
fort
motte
for
the
sake
of
fine
air
and
water
and
handsome
accommodations
the
british
had
erected
this
fort
in
the
yard
of
motte
elegant
new
house
which
was
nearly
enclosed
in
their
works
but
alas
so
little
do
poor
mortals
know
what
they
are
about
the
fine
house
which
they
had
rudely
taken
from
poor
motte
proved
to
the
british
what
his
gay
shirt
did
to
hercules
it
wrought
their
downfall
for
after
a
fierce
contest
in
which
many
valuable
lives
were
lost
on
both
sides
through
the
sharp
shooting
of
the
yaugers
and
the
still
closer
cutting
of
our
riflemen
it
struck
marion
that
he
could
quickly
drive
the
enemy
out
of
the
fort
by
setting
the
house
on
fire
but
poor
motte
a
lone
widow
whose
plantation
had
been
so
long
ravaged
by
the
war
herself
turned
into
a
log
cabin
her
negroes
dispersed
and
her
stock
grain
nearly
all
ruined
must
she
now
lose
her
elegant
buildings
too
such
scruples
were
honorable
to
the
general
but
they
showed
his
total
unacquaintedness
with
the
excellent
widow
for
at
the
first
glimpse
of
the
proposition
she
exclaimed
o
burn
it
burn
it
general
marion
god
forbid
i
should
bestow
a
single
thought
on
my
little
concerns
when
the
independence
of
my
country
is
at
stake
no
sir
if
it
were
a
palace
it
should
go
she
then
stepped
to
her
closet
and
brought
out
a
curious
bow
with
a
quiver
of
arrows
which
a
poor
african
boy
purchased
from
on
board
a
guineaman
had
formerly
presented
her
and
said
here
general
here
is
what
will
serve
your
purpose
to
a
hair
the
arrows
pointed
with
iron
and
charged
with
lighted
combustibles
were
shot
on
top
of
the
house
to
which
they
stuck
and
quickly
communicated
the
flames
the
british
two
hundred
in
number
besides
a
good
many
tories
instantly
hung
out
a
white
flag
in
sign
of
submission
the
excellent
motte
was
present
when
her
fine
new
house
supposed
to
be
worth
six
thousand
dollars
took
fire
and
without
a
sigh
beheld
the
red
spiry
billows
prevailing
over
all
its
grandeur
judge
william
dobein
james
who
was
present
assures
us
in
his
biography
of
marion
that
the
fire
was
put
out
before
much
mischief
was
done
the
day
after
the
destruction
of
her
house
she
invited
general
marion
with
all
the
officers
british
as
well
as
american
to
dine
with
her
having
now
no
better
place
of
accommodation
she
entertained
us
under
a
large
arbor
built
in
front
of
her
log
cabin
where
with
great
pleasure
i
observed
that
the
same
lady
could
one
day
act
the
spartan
and
the
next
the
parisian
thus
uniting
in
herself
the
rare
qualities
of
the
heroine
and
the
christian
for
my
life
i
could
not
keep
my
eyes
from
her
to
think
what
an
irreparable
injury
these
officers
had
done
her
and
yet
to
see
her
regardless
of
her
own
appetite
selecting
the
choicest
pieces
of
the
dish
and
helping
them
with
the
endearing
air
of
a
sister
appeared
to
me
one
of
the
loveliest
spectacles
i
had
ever
beheld
it
produced
the
happiest
effect
on
us
all
catching
her
amiable
spirit
we
seemed
to
have
entirely
forgotten
our
past
animosities
and
britons
and
americans
mingled
together
in
smiles
and
cheerful
chat
like
brothers
i
do
not
recollect
a
transaction
in
the
whole
war
in
which
i
can
think
that
god
looked
down
with
higher
complacency
than
on
this
and
to
the
day
of
my
death
i
shall
believe
that
god
enabled
us
to
beat
the
british
in
arms
because
we
had
so
far
beaten
them
in
generosity
men
who
under
such
cruel
provocations
could
display
such
moderation
as
we
did
must
certainly
have
given
our
maker
good
hope
that
we
were
equal
to
the
glorious
business
of
or
in
other
words
of
living
under
a
republic
which
must
certainly
be
his
delight
because
both
implying
and
producing
more
wisdom
and
virtue
than
any
other
government
among
men
the
name
of
the
british
commandant
our
prisoner
was
ferguson
and
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
he
was
too
as
i
found
on
getting
acquainted
with
him
which
i
soon
did
after
talking
over
our
various
adventures
in
the
war
he
asked
me
if
i
did
not
command
the
cavalry
in
the
late
skirmishing
between
watson
and
marion
i
told
him
i
did
well
replied
he
you
made
a
very
lucky
escape
that
day
for
do
you
know
that
we
were
twelve
hundred
strong
owing
to
colonel
joining
us
in
the
march
then
truly
said
i
if
that
were
the
case
i
made
a
lucky
escape
sure
enough
and
where
were
you
he
asked
again
when
general
marion
so
completely
surprised
our
guard
at
nelson
old
fields
were
you
there
i
told
him
i
was
not
but
that
my
brother
hugh
horry
was
well
continued
he
laughing
heartily
that
was
my
lucky
day
i
had
a
command
there
that
morning
of
about
thirty
men
as
an
advance
we
had
not
left
the
guard
more
than
five
minutes
before
the
americans
charged
and
swept
all
the
moment
we
heard
the
firing
and
the
cries
of
our
people
we
squatted
in
the
high
grass
like
so
many
rabbits
then
running
on
the
stoop
till
we
gained
the
woods
we
cleared
ourselves
i
laughed
and
asked
how
many
men
he
supposed
marion
had
that
morning
he
replied
he
really
did
not
know
but
supposed
he
must
have
had
three
or
four
hundred
well
sir
said
i
he
had
exactly
thirty
the
reader
may
perhaps
conceive
ferguson
astonishment
i
can
not
describe
it
soon
as
the
dishes
were
removed
we
were
presented
with
a
spectacle
to
which
our
eyes
had
long
been
strangers
a
brave
parade
of
excellent
wine
several
hampers
of
which
had
been
received
at
the
fort
the
very
day
before
we
commenced
the
attack
to
poor
soldiers
like
us
who
for
years
had
hardly
quenched
our
thirst
on
any
thing
better
than
water
or
apple
brandy
grog
this
was
a
sight
immensely
refreshing
whether
it
was
owing
to
the
virtues
of
this
noble
cordial
with
the
recollection
of
our
late
glorious
victories
or
whether
it
was
the
happy
result
of
our
generosity
to
the
enemy
and
of
their
correspondent
politeness
to
us
i
do
not
know
but
certain
it
is
we
were
all
very
gay
but
in
the
midst
of
our
enjoyments
which
none
seemed
to
relish
with
a
higher
glee
than
general
marion
a
british
soldier
came
up
and
whispered
to
one
of
their
officers
who
instantly
coming
round
to
the
general
told
him
in
a
low
voice
that
the
americans
were
hanging
the
tories
who
had
been
taken
in
the
fort
in
a
moment
he
sprang
up
in
a
violent
passion
and
snatching
his
sword
ran
down
towards
our
encampment
we
all
followed
him
though
without
knowing
the
cause
on
turning
the
corner
of
the
garden
which
had
concealed
their
cruel
deeds
we
discovered
a
sight
most
shocking
to
humanity
a
poor
man
hanging
in
the
air
to
the
beam
of
a
gate
and
struggling
hard
in
the
agonies
of
death
cut
him
down
cut
him
down
cried
the
general
as
soon
as
he
had
got
near
enough
to
be
heard
which
was
instantly
done
then
running
up
with
cheeks
as
red
as
fire
coals
and
half
choked
with
rage
he
bawled
out
in
the
name
of
god
what
are
you
about
what
are
you
about
here
only
hanging
a
few
tories
sir
replied
captain
harrison
of
lee
legion
who
gave
you
a
right
sir
to
touch
the
tories
to
this
young
of
the
same
corps
replied
that
it
was
only
three
or
four
rascals
of
them
that
they
meant
to
hang
and
that
they
had
not
supposed
the
general
would
mind
that
what
not
mind
murdering
the
prisoners
why
my
god
what
do
you
take
me
to
be
do
you
take
me
for
a
devil
then
after
placing
a
guard
over
the
tories
and
vowing
to
make
an
example
of
the
first
man
who
should
dare
to
offer
them
violence
he
returned
with
the
company
to
motte
table
of
the
three
unfortunate
tories
that
were
hung
dead
one
was
named
hugh
mizcally
the
name
of
the
person
so
timely
cut
down
was
levi
smith
a
most
furious
tory
this
title
produced
him
such
respect
among
those
degenerate
britons
that
they
appointed
him
gatekeeper
of
charleston
a
circumstance
that
operated
much
against
the
poor
whigs
in
the
country
for
smith
soon
broke
up
a
pious
kind
of
fraud
which
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
tories
had
for
some
time
carried
on
at
a
bold
rate
to
the
immortal
honor
of
the
ladies
of
south
carolina
they
were
much
more
whiggishly
given
than
the
men
insomuch
that
though
married
to
tories
they
would
be
whigs
still
these
fair
ladies
in
consequence
of
their
relation
to
the
tories
could
at
pleasure
pass
into
charleston
which
they
never
left
without
bringing
off
quantities
of
broad
cloth
cut
and
jumped
into
petticoats
and
artfully
hid
under
their
gowns
the
broad
cloth
thus
brought
off
was
for
regimentals
for
our
officers
things
went
on
swimmingly
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
till
smith
getting
one
day
more
groggy
and
impudent
than
usual
swore
that
some
young
women
who
were
going
out
at
the
gate
looked
much
bigger
over
the
hips
than
they
had
need
and
insisted
on
a
search
the
truth
is
these
fair
patriots
preparing
for
a
great
wedding
in
the
country
had
thus
spoiled
their
shape
and
brought
themselves
to
all
this
disgrace
by
their
over
greediness
for
finery
but
tory
smith
affected
to
be
so
enraged
by
this
trick
which
the
girls
had
attempted
to
play
on
him
that
he
would
never
afterwards
suffer
a
woman
to
pass
without
first
pulling
up
her
clothes
he
carried
his
zeal
to
such
length
as
one
day
very
grossly
to
insult
a
genteel
old
lady
a
her
son
who
was
a
dragoon
in
lee
legion
swore
vengeance
against
smith
and
would
as
we
have
seen
have
taken
his
life
had
not
marion
interposed
in
the
charleston
papers
of
that
day
smith
gives
the
history
of
his
escape
from
marion
wherein
he
relates
an
anecdote
which
if
it
be
true
and
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
it
shows
clear
enough
that
his
toryism
cost
him
dear
in
his
confinement
at
motte
house
he
was
excessively
uneasy
well
knowing
that
the
whigs
owed
him
no
good
will
and
fearing
that
the
next
time
they
got
a
halter
round
his
neck
he
might
find
no
marion
to
take
his
part
he
determined
if
possible
to
run
off
the
tories
were
all
handcuffed
two
and
two
and
confined
together
under
a
sentinel
in
what
was
called
a
made
of
pine
trees
cut
down
so
judgmatically
as
to
form
by
their
fall
a
pen
or
enclosure
it
was
smith
fortune
to
have
for
his
a
poor
sickly
creature
of
a
tory
who
though
hardly
able
to
go
was
prevailed
on
to
desert
with
him
they
had
not
travelled
far
into
the
woods
before
his
sick
companion
quite
overcome
with
fatigue
declared
he
could
go
no
farther
and
presently
fell
down
in
a
swoon
confined
by
the
handcuffs
smith
was
obliged
to
lie
by
him
in
the
woods
two
days
and
nights
without
meat
or
drink
and
his
comrade
frequently
in
convulsions
on
the
third
day
he
died
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
smith
drew
his
knife
and
separated
himself
from
the
dead
man
by
cutting
off
his
arm
at
the
elbow
which
he
bore
with
him
to
charleston
the
british
heartily
congratulated
his
return
and
restored
him
to
his
ancient
honor
of
sitting
at
the
king
gate
where
it
is
said
he
behaved
very
decently
ever
afterwards
smith
friends
say
of
him
that
in
his
own
country
south
carolina
he
hardly
possessed
money
enough
to
buy
a
pig
but
when
he
got
to
england
after
the
war
he
made
out
as
if
the
rebels
had
robbed
him
of
as
many
flocks
and
herds
as
the
wild
arabs
did
job
the
british
government
remarkable
for
generosity
to
their
friends
in
distress
gave
him
money
enough
to
return
to
south
carolina
with
a
pretty
assortment
of
merchandise
and
he
is
now
i
am
told
as
wealthy
as
a
jew
and
which
is
still
more
to
his
credit
as
courteous
as
a
christian

his

happy
carolina
dear
native
country
hail
long
and
dismal
has
been
the
night
of
thy
affliction
but
now
rise
and
sing
for
thy
light
is
breaking
forth
and
the
dawn
of
thy
redemption
is
brightening
around
for
opposing
the
curses
of
slavery
thy
noblest
citizens
have
been
branded
as
and
treated
with
a
barbarity
unknown
amongst
civilized
nations
they
have
been
taken
from
their
beds
and
weeping
families
and
transported
to
pine
and
die
in
a
land
of
strangers
they
have
been
crowded
into
midsummer
jails
and
dungeons
there
unpitied
to
perish
amidst
suffocation
and
stench
while
their
wives
and
children
in
mournful
groups
around
the
walls
were
asking
with
tears
for
their
husbands
and
fathers
all
europe
was
filled
with
horror
at
the
history
of
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
unfortunate
englishmen
that
were
suffocated
in
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
little
was
it
thought
that
an
english
nobleman
lord
rawdon
would
so
soon
have
repeated
that
crime
by
crowding
one
hundred
and
unfortunate
americans
into
a
small
prison
in
camden
in
the
dogdays
they
have
been
wantonly
murdered
with
swords
and
bayonets
or
hung
up
like
dogs
to
ignominious
gibbets
a
brother
of
that
excellent
man
major
linning
of
charleston
was
taken
from
his
plantation
on
ashley
river
by
one
of
the
enemy
galleys
and
thrust
down
into
the
hold
at
night
the
officers
began
to
drink
and
sing
and
kept
it
up
till
twelve
when
by
way
of
frolic
they
had
him
brought
though
sick
into
their
cabin
held
a
court
martial
over
him
sentenced
him
to
death
very
deliberately
executed
the
sentence
by
stabbing
him
with
bayonets
and
then
threw
his
mangled
body
into
the
river
for
the
sharks
and
crabs
to
devour
they
have
been
stirred
up
and
exasperated
against
each
other
to
the
most
unnatural
and
bloody
strifes
fathers
to
kill
their
sons
and
brothers
to
put
brothers
to
death
such
were
the
deeds
of
cornwallis
and
his
officers
in
carolina
and
while
the
churches
in
england
were
everywhere
resounding
with
prayers
to
almighty
god
to
spare
the
effusion
of
human
blood
those
monsters
were
shedding
it
with
the
most
savage
wantonness
while
all
the
good
people
in
britain
were
praying
day
and
night
for
a
speedy
restoration
of
the
former
happy
friendship
between
england
and
america
those
wretches
were
taking
the
surest
steps
to
drive
all
friendship
from
the
american
bosom
and
to
kindle
the
flames
of
everlasting
hatred
but
blessed
be
god
the
tears
of
the
widows
and
orphans
have
prevailed
against
them
and
the
righteous
judge
of
all
the
earth
is
rising
up
to
make
inquisition
for
the
innocent
blood
which
they
have
shed
and
never
was
his
hand
more
visibly
displayed
in
the
casting
down
of
the
wicked
than
in
humbling
cornwallis
and
his
bloody
crew
at
this
period

were
the
only
parts
of

rose
up
as

took
their

they

with

the

gathering
around
their

rushed
to

but
though
seemingly
blind
and
headlong
as
their

yet
there
was
a
hand
unseen
that
guided

all
met

with

the
leaden

whizzing
from

in

minutes

was
slain
and

fled
leaving

with
only
four
hundred
to
contend
against
thirteen
hundred

fifty
rushing
on
furiously
as
to
certain
victory
what
spectator
of
this
scene
must
not
have
given
up
all
for
lost
and
with
tears
resigned
this
little
forlorn
to
that
unsparing
slaughter
which
colonel
tarleton
delighted
in
but
contrary
to
all
human
expectation
the
devoted
handful
stood
their
ground
and
in
a
short
time
killed
and
captured
nearly
the
whole
of
their
proud
assailants

have
been
left
largely
unremarked
in

the
disservice
done
to

to
note
that

so
fast
upon
the

encumbered
with
their
prisoners
that
on
the
evening
of
the
ninth

he
came
up
to
the
banks
of
the
catawba
just
as
morgan
rear
had
crossed
at
a
deep
ford
before
the
morning
returned
the
river
was
so
swollen
by
a
heavy
rain
that
cornwallis
could
not
pass
adoring
the
hand
of
heaven
the
americans
continued
their
flight
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
cornwallis

the

came

about
to

ford
presently
the
rain
came
rushing
down
in
torrents
and
by
the
morning

the
furious
river
was
impassable

so
blind
as
not
to
acknowledge
the
hand
of
god
in
all
this
soon
as
he
could
get
over
the
wrathful
cornwallis
renewed
the
pursuit
but
before
he
could
overtake
them
at
guilford
courthouse
the
americans
joined
by
their
countrymen
gave
him
battle
and
killed
one
third
of
his
army
cornwallis
then
in
turn
fled
before
the

and
as
he
had
outmarched
them
before
he
outran

at

draw
their

hew
the
wretches

pieces
only
one
hundred

their
escape
these
fall
in
the
next
day
with
colonel
tarleton
who
mistaking
them
for
what
he
called
damned
rebels
ordered
his
troops
to
charge
which
they
did
and
regardless
of
their
repeated
cries
that
they
were
the
king
best
friends
put
most
of
them
to
death
thus
wonderfully
did
god
baffle
lord
cornwallis
and
visit
a
sudden
and
bloody
destruction
upon
those
unnatural
wretches
who
were
going
forth
to
plunge
their
swords
into
the
bowels
of
their
own
country

great
joy
of

patriotism
of

when
a
lion

has
long
kept
at

fierce
assaulting
shepherds
receives
at

his
mortal
wound
suddenly
the
monster
trembles
under
the
deadly
stroke
and
sadly

looks
around
with

such
was
the
shock
given
to
the
british
when
the
sword
of
justice
struck
down
the
bloody
cornwallis
with
him
fell
the
hopes
of
the
enemy
throughout
our
state
in
charleston
their
officers
were
seen
standing
together
in
groups
shaking
their
heads
as
they
talked
of
the
dreadful
news
while
those
who
had
marched
up
so
boldly
into
the
country
now
were
every
where
busied
in
demolishing
their
works
blowing
up
their
magazines
and
hurrying
back
to
town
in
the
utmost
dismay
hard
pressing
upon
the
rear
we
followed
the
steps
of
their
flight
joyfully
chasing
them
from
a
country
which
they
had
stained
with
blood
and
pursuing
them
to
the
very
gates
of
charleston
as
we
approached
the
city
our
eyes
were
presented
with
scenes
of
desolation
sufficient
to
damp
all
hearts
and
to
inspire
the
deepest
sense
of
the
horrors
of
war
robbed
of
all
animal
and
vegetable
life
the
neighboring
plantations
seemed
but
as
dreary
deserts
compared
with
what
they
once
were
when
covered
with
sportive
flocks
and
herds
and
rice
and
corn
they
smiled
with
plenteousness
and
joy
in
the
fields
the
eyes
beheld
no
sign
of
cheerful
crops
nor
in
the
woods
any
shape
of
living
beast
or
bird
except
a
few
mournful
buzzards
silently
devouring
the
unburied
flesh
of
some
poor
wretched
mortals
who
had
fallen
in
the
late
rencontres
between
the
english
and
americans
indeed
had
those
days
continued
no
flesh
could
have
been
saved
but
blessed
be
god
who
shortened
them
by
chastising
the
aggressors
the
british
as
we
have
seen
on
the
memorable
of
december
we
entered
and
took
possession
of
our
capital
after
it
had
been
two
years
seven
months
and
two
days
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
the
style
of
our
entry
was
quite
novel
and
romantic
on
condition
of
not
being
molested
while
embarking
the
british
had
offered
to
leave
the
town
unhurt
accordingly
at
the
firing
of
a
signal
gun
in
the
morning
as
agreed
on
they
quitted
their
advanced
works
near
the
town
gate
while
the
americans
moving
on
close
in
the
rear
followed
them
all
along
through
the
city
down
to
the
water
edge
where
they
embarked
on
board
their
three
hundred
ships
which
moored
out
in
the
bay
in
the
shape
of
an
immense
half
moon
presented
a
most
magnificent
appearance
the
morning
was
as
lovely
as
pure
wintry
air
and
cloudless
sunbeams
could
render
it
but
rendered
far
lovelier
still
by
our
procession
if
i
may
so
call
it
which
was
well
calculated
to
awaken
the
most
pleasurable
feelings
in
front
were
the
humble
remains
of
that
proud
army
which
one
and
thirty
months
ago
captured
our
city
and
thence
in
the
drunkenness
of
victory
had
hurled
menaces
and
cruelties
disgraceful
to
the
british
name
and
close
in
the
rear
was
our
band
of
patriots
bending
forward
with
martial
music
and
flying
colors
to
play
the
last
joyful
act
in
the
drama
of
their
country
deliverance
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captive
to
recall
the
smile
on
the
cheek
of
sorrow
and
to
make
the
heart
of
the
widow
leap
for
joy
numbers
who
for
years
had
been
confined
to
a
single
room
in
their
own
elegant
houses
could
now
throw
open
their
doors
and
breathe
and
walk
at
large
in
these
beloved
apartments
from
which
they
had
been
so
long
excluded
numbers
who
for
years
had
mourned
their
separation
from
children
wives
and
sires
were
now
seen
rushing
with
trembling
joy
to
the
embrace
oh
it
was
a
day
of
jubilee
indeed
a
day
of
rejoicing
never
to
be
forgotten
smiles
and
tears
were
on
every
face
for
who
could
remain
unmoved
when
they
saw
the
little
children
running
with
outstretched
arms
to
embrace
their
long
absent
fathers
when
they
saw
the
aged
trembling
with
years
and
affection
clasping
their
warrior
sons
glorious
in
arms
and
those
sons
with
eyes
returning
the
pious
embrace
and
congratulating
the
deliverance
of
their
fathers
while
all
along
the
streets
as
we
moved
in
clouds
of
dust
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
shouts
of
liberty
and
america
forever
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
crowds
of
citizens
shaking
hands
and
thanking
god
for
bringing
them
to
see
that
happy
day
and
to
crown
all
on
both
sides
of
us
as
we
marched
in
shining
rows
stood
our
beauteous
countrywomen
mingling
their
congratulations
the
day
was
precious
to
all
but
none
i
believe
enjoyed
it
so
highly
as
did
the
ladies
of
charleston
being
great
numbers
of
them
at
least
women
of
fortune
and
liberal
education
they
had
early
discovered
the
deformity
of
lord
north
enslaving
principles
unconditional
taxation
which
they
abhorred
worse
than
the
yaws
and
hating
the
measure
they
could
not
but
dislike
the
men
who
were
come
to
execute
it
in
common
with
their
sex
they
were
sufficiently
partial
to
soldiers
of
honor
but
alas
they
were
not
permitted
the
pleasure
to
contemplate
the
british
in
that
prepossessing
light
on
the
contrary
compelled
to
view
them
as
mere
machines
venal
wretches
who
for
pay
and
plunder
had
degraded
the
man
into
the
brute
the
briton
into
the
buccaneer
how
could
they
otherwise
than
detest
them
nor
were
the
manners
of
the
british
officers
at
all
calculated
to
remove
those
antipathies
coming
to
america
under
the
impression
that
the
past
generation
were
and
the
present
they
looked
on
and
treated
their
daughters
only
as
creoles
whom
it
was
doing
great
honor
to
smile
on
but
this
prejudice
against
the
british
officers
founded
first
on
their
sordidness
then
secondly
fed
by
their
insolence
was
thirdly
and
lastly
matured
by
their
cruelty
to
see
the
heads
of
their
first
families
without
even
a
charge
of
crime
dragged
from
their
beds
at
midnight
and
packed
off
like
slaves
to
augustine
to
see
one
of
their
most
esteemed
countrymen
the
amiable
colonel
haynes
hung
up
like
a
dog
before
their
eyes
and
to
hear
continually
from
all
parts
of
the
horrid
and
murders
committed
by
rawdon
tarleton
weymies
and
their
tory
and
negro
allies
filled
up
the
measure
of
female
detestation
of
the
british
officers
they
scorned
to
be
seen
in
the
same
public
walks
with
them
would
not
touch
a
glove
or
from
their
hands
and
in
short
turned
away
from
them
as
from
the
commonest
felons
or
and
on
the
other
hand
to
be
treated
thus
by
girls
the
rebel
daughters
of
convict
parents
was
more
than
the
british
officers
could
put
up
with
the
whig
ladies
of
course
were
often
insulted
and
that
very
grossly
too
and
not
only
often
threatened
but
actually
thrown
into
the
provost
or
bastile
no
wonder
then
that
they
were
highly
delighted
to
see
such
rude
enemies
after
repeated
overthrows
in
the
country
chased
back
to
town
and
thence
covered
with
disgrace
embarking
to
leave
the
country
for
ever
no
wonder
that
on
hearing
of
our
line
of
march
that
morning
they
had
decked
themselves
in
their
richest
habits
and
at
the
first
sound
of
our
drums
flew
to
their
doors
windows
and
balconies
to
welcome
our
return
never
before
had
they
appeared
half
so
charming
sweet
are
the
flowers
of
the
field
at
every
season
of
the
year
but
doubly
sweet
when
after
long
icy
winter
they
spread
all
their
blossoms
to
the
sun
even
so
the
daughters
of
charleston
though
always
fair
yet
never
seemed
so
passing
fair
as
now
when
after
sustaining
the
long
wintry
storms
of
british
oppression
they
came
forth
in
all
their
patriot
charms
to
greet
the
welcome
beams
of
returning
liberty

never
shall
i

the
accents
of
those
lovely
lips

waving
handkerchiefs

half
concealed

chapter
marion
returns
to
his
plantation
is
appointed
a
member
of
the
legislature
some
valuable
anecdotes
of
him
his
marriage
and
retirement
after
the
retreat
of
the
british
from
carolina
marion
sheathed
his
sword
for
lack
of
argument
and
went
up
to
cultivate
his
little
plantation
in
john
parish
where
he
was
born
but
the
gratitude
of
his
countrymen
did
not
long
allow
him
to
enjoy
the
sweets
of
that
rural
life
of
which
he
was
uncommonly
fond
at
the
next
election
he
was
in
some
sort
compelled
to
stand
as
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
to
which
by
an
unanimous
voice
he
was
sent
to
aid
with
his
counsel
the
operations
of
that
government
to
whose
freedom
his
sword
had
so
largely
contributed
the
friends
of
humanity
were
all
highly
pleased
with
his
call
to
the
legislature
from
his
well
known
generosity
to
his
enemies
during
the
war
they
fondly
hoped
he
would
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
extinguish
that
horrid
flame
of
revenge
which
still
glowed
in
the
bosoms
of
many
against
the
tories
nor
did
marion
disappoint
their
hopes
his
face
was
always
and
undauntedly
set
against
every
proposition
that
savored
of
severity
to
the
tories
whom
he
used
to
call
his
poor
deluded
countrymen
the
reader
may
form
some
idea
of
general
marion
from
the
following
anecdote
which
was
related
to
me
by
the
honorable
benjamin
huger
esq
during
the
furious
contests
in
south
carolina
between
the
british
and
americans
it
was
very
common
for
men
of
property
to
play
of
both
sides
for
the
sake
of
saving
their
negroes
and
cattle
among
these
a
pretty
numerous
crew
was
a
wealthy
old
blade
who
had
the
advantage
of
one
of
those
very
accommodating
faces
that
could
shine
with
equal
lustre
on
his
victorious
visitants
whether
britons
or
buckskins
marion
soon
found
him
out
and
as
soon
gave
him
a
broad
hint
how
heartily
he
despised
such
for
at
a
great
public
meeting
where
the
old
gentleman
with
a
smirking
face
came
up
and
presented
his
hand
marion
turned
from
him
without
deigning
to
receive
it
everybody
was
surprised
at
this
conduct
of
the
general
and
some
spoke
of
it
in
terms
of
high
displeasure
however
it
was
not
long
before
they
caught
the
old
weathercock
at
one
of
his
tricks
and
soon
as
the
confiscation
act
was
passed
had
him
down
on
the
black
list
fondly
hoping
no
doubt
to
divide
a
large
spoil
marion
who
was
then
a
member
of
the
legislature
arose
to
speak
the
aged
culprit
who
also
was
present
turned
pale
and
trembled
at
the
sight
of
marion
giving
up
all
for
lost
but
how
great
how
agreeable
was
his
surprise
when
instead
of
hearing
the
general
thundering
against
him
for
judgment
he
heard
him
imploring
for
mercy
his
accusers
were
if
possible
still
more
astonished
having
counted
on
general
marion
as
his
firmest
foe
they
were
utterly
mortified
to
find
him
his
fastest
friend
and
venting
their
passion
with
great
freedom
taxed
him
with
inconsistency
and
fickleness
that
but
illy
suited
with
general
marion
character
it
is
scarcely
eighteen
months
sir
said
they
since
you
treated
this
old
rascal
with
the
most
pointed
and
public
contempt
on
account
of
the
very
crime
for
which
we
wish
to
punish
him
and
here
now
instead
of
taking
part
against
him
you
have
declared
in
his
favor
and
have
become
his
warmest
advocate
with
a
legislature
true
gentlemen
replied
marion
but
you
should
remember
that
it
was
war
then
and
therefore
my
duty
to
make
a
difference
between
the
real
and
pretended
friends
of
my
country
but
it
is
peace
now
and
we
ought
to
remember
the
virtues
of
men
particularly
of
the
old
and
timid
rather
than
their
follies
and
we
ought
to
remember
too
that
god
has
given
us
the
victory
for
which
we
owe
him
eternal
gratitude
but
cruelty
to
man
is
not
the
way
to
show
our
gratitude
to
heaven
of
the
same
complexion
was
his
behavior
in
a
large
party
at
governor
matthew
table
just
after
the
passage
of
the
famous
act
to
confiscate
the
estates
of
the
tories
come
general
give
us
a
toast
said
the
governor
the
glasses
were
all
filled
and
the
eyes
of
the
company
fixed
upon
the
general
who
waving
his
bumper
in
the
air
thus
nobly
called
out
well
gentlemen
here
damnation
to
the
confiscation
act
the
following
anecdote
of
marion
i
have
heard
from
a
thousand
lips
and
every
time
with
that
joy
on
the
countenance
which
evinced
the
deep
interest
which
the
heart
takes
in
talking
of
things
that
are
honorable
to
our
countrymen
while
marion
was
a
member
of
the
legislature
a
petition
was
presented
to
the
house
for
an
act
of
amnesty
of
all
those
arbitrary
measures
which
the
american
officers
had
been
obliged
to
adopt
during
the
war
in
order
to
get
horses
provisions
for
the
army
the
petition
was
signed
by
the
names
of
all
the
favorite
officers
of
the
state
and
among
the
rest
by
that
of
our
hero
some
of
his
friends
it
seemed
had
done
it
for
him
on
the
supposition
that
he
needed
such
an
act
as
well
as
the
rest
but
marion
who
had
listened
very
attentively
to
the
reading
of
the
petition
on
hearing
his
name
mentioned
as
one
of
the
subscribers
instantly
arose
and
insisted
that
his
name
should
be
struck
off
from
that
paper
he
said
he
had
no
manner
of
objection
to
the
petition
on
the
contrary
he
most
heartily
approved
of
it
and
meant
to
vote
for
it
for
well
did
he
know
he
said
that
during
the
war
we
had
among
us
a
world
of
ignoramuses
who
for
lack
of
knowing
their
danger
did
not
care
a
fig
how
the
war
went
but
were
sauntering
about
in
the
woods
popping
at
the
squirrels
when
they
ought
to
have
been
in
the
field
fighting
the
british
that
such
gentlemen
since
they
did
not
choose
to
do
any
thing
for
their
country
themselves
might
well
afford
to
let
their
cattle
do
something
and
as
they
had
not
shed
any
of
their
blood
for
the
public
service
they
might
certainly
spare
a
little
corn
to
it
at
any
rate
he
had
no
notion
he
said
of
turning
over
to
the
mercy
of
these
poltroons
some
of
the
choicest
spirits
of
the
nation
to
be
prosecuted
and
torn
to
pieces
by
them
but
that
nevertheless
he
did
not
like
to
have
his
name
to
the
petition
for
thank
god
he
had
no
favors
to
ask
of
them
and
if
during
the
war
for
his
country
he
had
done
any
of
them
harm
there
was
he
and
yonder
his
property
and
let
them
come
forward
if
they
dare
and
demand
satisfaction
and
i
never
heard
of
any
man
who
ever
accused
him
of
the
least
injury
done
him
during
all
the
war
marion
continued
a
member
of
the
legislature
until
orders
were
issued
to
repair
and
put
in
commission
fort
johnson
to
the
command
of
which
he
was
appointed
with
the
pay
of
about
hundred
dollars
per
annum
though
this
salary
had
been
voted
him
chiefly
because
of
his
losses
during
the
war
yet
it
was
not
continued
to
him
longer
than
two
or
three
years
when
it
was
reduced
to
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
annually
numbers
of
people
had
their
feelings
greatly
hurt
on
this
occasion
and
i
dare
say
much
worse
than
his
own
for
he
was
a
man
who
cared
very
little
for
money
and
besides
about
that
time
he
entered
into
matrimony
with
that
excellent
and
wealthy
lady
miss
mary
videau
who
with
her
affections
bestowed
on
him
a
fortune
sufficient
to
satisfy
his
utmost
wishes
even
though
they
had
been
far
less
moderate
than
they
were
seeing
now
no
particular
obligation
on
him
to
continue
longer
in
the
public
service
he
gladly
yielded
to
his
sense
of
what
he
owed
to
a
generous
and
beloved
companion
and
with
her
retired
to
his
native
parish
of
john
where
amidst
the
benedictions
of
his
countrymen
and
the
caresses
of
numerous
friends
he
spent
the
short
remnant
of
his
days
participating
every
rural
sweet
with
the
dear
woman
of
his
choice
feasting
on
the
happy
retrospect
of
a
life
passed
in
fighting
for
the
rights
of
man
and
fondly
cherishing
the
hopes
of
a
better
chapter
the
author
last
visit
to
marion
interesting
conversation
on
the
importance
of
public
instruction
free
schools
shown
to
be
a
great
saving
to
a
nation
i
often
went
to
see
marion
our
evenings
were
passed
as
might
have
been
expected
between
two
old
friends
who
had
spent
their
better
days
together
in
scenes
of
honorable
enterprise
and
danger
on
the
night
of
the
last
visit
i
ever
made
him
observing
that
the
clock
was
going
for
ten
i
asked
him
if
it
were
not
near
his
hour
of
rest
oh
no
said
he
we
must
not
talk
of
bed
yet
it
is
but
seldom
you
know
that
we
meet
and
as
this
may
be
our
last
let
us
take
all
we
can
of
it
in
chat
what
do
you
think
of
the
times
o
glorious
times
said
i
yes
thank
god
replied
he
they
are
glorious
times
indeed
and
fully
equal
to
all
that
we
had
in
hope
when
we
drew
our
swords
for
independence
but
i
am
afraid
they
wo
last
long
i
asked
him
why
he
thought
so
oh
knowledge
sir
said
he
is
wanting
knowledge
is
wanting
israel
of
old
you
know
was
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
and
all
nations
all
individuals
have
come
to
naught
from
the
same
cause
i
told
him
i
thought
we
were
too
happy
to
change
so
soon
pshaw
replied
he
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
happiness
signifies
nothing
if
it
be
not
known
and
properly
valued
satan
we
are
told
was
once
an
angel
of
light
but
for
want
of
duly
considering
his
glorious
state
he
rebelled
and
lost
all
and
how
many
hundreds
of
young
carolinians
have
we
not
known
whose
fathers
left
them
all
the
means
of
happiness
elegant
estates
handsome
wives
and
in
short
every
blessing
that
the
most
luxurious
could
desire
yet
they
could
not
rest
until
by
drinking
and
gambling
they
had
fooled
away
their
fortunes
parted
from
their
wives
and
rendered
themselves
the
veriest
beggars
and
blackguards
on
earth
now
why
was
all
this
but
for
lack
of
knowledge
for
had
those
silly
ones
but
known
the
evils
of
poverty
what
a
vile
thing
it
was
to
wear
a
dirty
shirt
a
long
beard
and
ragged
coat
to
go
without
a
dinner
or
to
sponge
for
it
among
growling
relations
or
to
be
bespattered
or
run
over
in
the
streets
by
the
sons
of
those
who
were
once
their
fathers
overseers
i
say
had
those
poor
boobies
in
the
days
of
their
prosperity
known
these
things
as
they
now
do
would
they
have
squandered
away
the
precious
means
of
independence
and
pleasure
and
have
brought
themselves
to
all
this
shame
and
sorrow
no
never
never
never
and
so
it
is
most
exactly
with
nations
if
those
that
are
free
and
happy
did
but
know
their
blessings
do
you
think
they
would
ever
exchange
them
for
slavery
if
the
carthagenians
for
example
in
the
days
of
their
freedom
and
when
they
obeyed
no
laws
but
of
their
own
making
paid
no
taxes
but
for
their
own
benefit
and
free
as
air
pursued
their
own
interest
as
they
liked
i
say
if
that
once
glorious
and
happy
people
had
known
their
blessings
would
they
have
sacrificed
them
all
by
their
accursed
factions
to
the
romans
to
be
ruled
they
and
their
children
with
a
rod
of
iron
to
be
burdened
like
beasts
and
crucified
like
malefactors
no
surely
they
would
not
well
now
to
bring
this
home
to
ourselves
we
fought
for
and
god
hath
pleased
to
give
us
one
better
calculated
perhaps
to
protect
our
rights
to
foster
our
virtues
to
call
forth
our
energies
and
to
advance
our
condition
nearer
to
perfection
and
happiness
than
any
government
that
was
ever
framed
under
the
sun
but
what
signifies
even
this
government
divine
as
it
is
if
it
be
not
known
and
prized
as
it
deserves
i
asked
him
how
he
thought
this
was
best
to
be
done
why
certainly
replied
he
by
free
schools
i
shook
my
head
he
observed
it
and
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
that
i
told
him
i
was
afraid
the
legislature
would
look
to
their
popularity
and
dread
the
expense
he
exclaimed
god
preserve
our
legislature
from
such
wit
and
pound
foolishness
what
sir
keep
a
nation
in
ignorance
rather
than
vote
a
little
of
their
own
money
for
education
only
let
such
politicians
remember
what
poor
carolina
has
already
lost
through
her
ignorance
what
was
it
that
brought
the
british
last
war
to
carolina
but
her
lack
of
knowledge
had
the
people
been
enlightened
they
would
have
been
united
and
had
they
been
united
they
never
would
have
been
attacked
a
second
time
by
the
british
for
after
that
drubbing
they
got
from
us
at
fort
moultrie
in
they
would
as
soon
have
attacked
the
devil
as
have
attacked
carolina
again
had
they
not
heard
that
they
were
house
divided
against
itself
or
in
other
words
had
amongst
us
a
great
number
of
tories
men
who
through
mere
ignorance
were
disaffected
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
ready
to
join
the
british
against
their
own
countrymen
thus
ignorance
begat
toryism
and
toryism
begat
losses
in
carolina
of
which
few
have
any
idea
according
to
the
best
accounts
america
spent
in
the
last
war
seventy
millions
of
dollars
which
divided
among
the
states
according
to
their
population
gives
to
carolina
about
eight
millions
making
as
the
war
lasted
eight
years
a
million
a
year
now
it
is
generally
believed
the
british
after
their
loss
of
burgoyne
and
their
fine
northern
army
would
soon
have
given
up
the
contest
had
it
not
been
for
the
foothold
they
got
in
carolina
which
protracted
the
war
at
least
two
years
longer
and
as
this
two
years
ruinous
war
in
carolina
was
owing
to
the
encouragement
the
enemy
got
there
and
that
encouragement
to
toryism
and
that
toryism
to
ignorance
ignorance
may
fairly
be
debited
to
two
millions
of
loss
to
carolina
well
in
these
two
extra
years
of
war
carolina
lost
at
least
four
thousand
men
and
among
them
a
laurens
a
williams
a
campbell
a
haynes
and
many
others
whose
worth
not
the
gold
of
ophir
could
value
but
rated
at
the
price
at
which
the
prince
of
hesse
sold
his
people
to
george
the
third
to
shoot
the
americans
say
thirty
pounds
sterling
a
head
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
they
make
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
then
count
the
thousand
slaves
which
carolina
certainly
lost
and
each
slave
at
the
moderate
price
of
three
hundred
dollars
and
yet
have
seven
millions
five
hundred
thousand
to
this
add
the
houses
barns
and
stables
that
were
burnt
the
plate
plundered
the
furniture
lost
the
hogs
sheep
and
horned
cattle
killed
the
rice
corn
and
other
crops
destroyed
and
they
amount
at
the
most
moderate
calculation
to
five
millions
now
to
say
nothing
of
those
losses
which
can
not
be
rated
by
dollars
and
cents
such
as
the
destruction
of
morals
and
the
distraction
of
childless
parents
and
widows
but
counting
those
only
that
are
of
the
plainest
calculations
such
as
carolina
loss
in
the
extra
two
years
war
for
her
four
thousand
citizens
slain
in
that
time
for
thousand
slaves
lost
for
buildings
furniture
cattle
grain
destroyed
making
the
enormous
sum
of
fifteen
millions
and
odd
dollars
capital
and
bearing
an
annual
interest
of
nearly
ten
hundred
thousand
dollars
besides
and
all
this
for
lack
of
a
few
free
schools
which
would
have
cost
the
state
a
mere
nothing
i
sighed
and
told
him
i
wished
he
had
not
broached
the
subject
for
it
had
made
me
very
sad
yes
replied
he
it
is
enough
to
make
any
one
sad
but
it
can
not
be
helped
but
by
a
wiser
course
of
things
for
if
people
will
not
do
what
will
make
them
happy
god
will
surely
chastise
them
and
this
dreadful
loss
of
public
property
is
one
token
of
his
displeasure
at
our
neglect
of
public
instruction
i
asked
him
if
this
were
really
his
belief
yes
sir
replied
he
with
great
earnestness
it
is
my
belief
and
i
would
not
exchange
it
for
worlds
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
every
evil
under
the
sun
is
of
the
nature
of
chastisement
and
appointed
of
the
infinitely
good
being
for
our
benefit
when
you
see
a
youth
who
but
lately
was
the
picture
of
bloom
and
manly
beauty
now
utterly
withered
and
decayed
his
body
bent
his
teeth
dropping
out
his
nose
consumed
with
foetid
breath
ichorous
eyes
and
his
whole
appearance
most
putrid
ghastly
and
loathsome
you
are
filled
with
pity
and
with
horror
you
can
hardly
believe
there
is
a
god
or
hardly
refrain
from
charging
him
with
cruelty
but
where
folly
raves
wisdom
adores
in
this
awful
scourge
of
lawless
lust
wisdom
discerns
the
infinite
price
which
heaven
sets
on
conjugal
purity
and
love
in
like
manner
the
enormous
sacrifice
of
public
property
in
the
last
war
being
no
more
as
before
observed
than
the
natural
effect
of
public
ignorance
ought
to
teach
us
that
of
all
sins
there
is
none
so
hateful
to
god
as
national
ignorance
that
unfailing
spring
of
national
ingratitude
rebellion
slavery
and
wretchedness
but
if
it
be
melancholy
to
think
of
so
many
elegant
houses
rich
furniture
fat
cattle
and
precious
crops
destroyed
for
want
of
that
patriotism
which
a
true
knowledge
of
our
interests
would
have
inspired
then
how
much
more
melancholy
to
think
of
those
torrents
of
precious
blood
that
were
shed
those
cruel
slaughters
and
massacres
that
took
place
among
the
citizens
from
the
same
cause
as
proof
that
such
hellish
tragedies
would
never
have
been
acted
had
our
state
but
been
enlightened
only
let
us
look
at
the
people
of
new
england
from
britain
their
fathers
had
fled
to
america
for
religion
sake
religion
had
taught
them
that
god
created
men
to
be
happy
that
to
be
happy
they
must
have
virtue
that
virtue
is
not
to
be
attained
without
knowledge
nor
knowledge
without
instruction
nor
public
instruction
without
free
schools
nor
free
schools
without
legislative
order
among
a
people
who
fear
god
the
knowledge
of
duty
is
the
same
as
doing
it
believing
it
to
be
the
first
command
of
god
let
there
be
light
and
believing
it
to
be
the
will
of
god
that
all
should
be
instructed
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
these
wise
legislators
at
once
set
about
public
instruction
they
did
not
ask
how
will
my
constituents
like
this
wo
they
turn
me
out
shall
i
not
lose
my
three
dollars
per
day
no
but
fully
persuaded
that
public
instruction
is
god
will
because
the
people
good
they
set
about
it
like
the
true
friends
of
the
people
now
mark
the
happy
consequence
when
the
war
broke
out
you
heard
of
no
division
in
new
england
no
toryism
nor
any
of
its
horrid
effects
no
houses
in
flames
kindled
by
the
hands
of
no
neighbors
waylaying
and
shooting
their
neighbors
plundering
their
property
carrying
off
their
stock
and
aiding
the
british
in
the
cursed
work
of
american
murder
and
subjugation
but
on
the
contrary
with
minds
well
informed
of
their
rights
and
hearts
glowing
with
love
for
themselves
and
posterity
they
rose
up
against
the
enemy
firm
and
united
as
a
band
of
shepherds
against
the
ravening
wolves
and
their
valor
in
the
field
gave
glorious
proof
how
men
will
fight
when
they
know
that
their
all
is
at
stake
see
major
pitcairn
on
the
memorable
of
april
marching
from
boston
with
one
thousand
british
regulars
to
burn
the
american
stores
at
concord
though
this
heroic
excursion
was
commenced
under
cover
of
the
night
the
farmers
soon
took
the
alarm
and
gathering
around
them
with
their
fowling
pieces
presently
knocked
down
of
their
number
and
caused
the
rest
to
run
as
if
like
the
swine
in
the
gospel
they
had
a
legion
of
devils
at
their
backs
now
with
sorrowful
eyes
let
us
turn
to
our
own
state
where
no
pains
were
ever
taken
to
enlighten
the
minds
of
the
poor
there
we
have
seen
a
people
naturally
as
brave
as
the
new
englanders
for
mere
lack
of
knowledge
of
their
blessings
possessed
of
the
dangers
threatened
suffer
lord
cornwallis
with
only
sixteen
hundred
men
to
chase
general
greene
upwards
of
three
hundred
miles
in
fact
to
scout
him
through
the
two
great
states
of
south
and
north
carolina
as
far
as
guilford
courthouse
and
when
greene
joined
at
that
place
by
two
thousand
poor
illiterate
determined
at
length
to
fight
what
did
he
gain
by
them
with
all
their
number
but
disappointment
and
disgrace
for
though
posted
very
advantageously
behind
the
fences
they
could
not
stand
a
single
fire
from
the
british
but
in
spite
of
their
officers
broke
and
fled
like
slaves
leaving
their
loaded
muskets
sticking
in
the
fence
corners
again
as
weems
has
slandered
a
great
number
of
brave
and
true
it
should
be
noted
that
being
desperate
to
make
his
point
he
is
not
entirely
frank
here
in
his
descriptions
of
events
the
poor
ditch
described
below
was
doubtless
better
protection
than
fences
nor
did
the
militia
flee
the
field
but
only
fell
back
on
the
main
body
other
factors
also
figured
such
as
differences
in
population
density
and
geography
finally
a
large
number
of
the
new
england
loyalists
tories
whose
existence
weems
denies
fought
for
the
british
in
the
carolinas
but
from
this
shameful
sight
turn
again
to
the
land
of
free
schools
to
bunker
hill
there
behind
a
poor
ditch
of
half
a
night
raising
you
behold
fifteen
hundred
waiting
the
approach
of
three
thousand
british
regulars
with
a
heavy
train
of
artillery
with
such
odds
against
them
such
fearful
odds
in
numbers
discipline
arms
and
martial
fame
will
they
not
shrink
from
the
contest
and
like
their
southern
friends
jump
up
and
run
oh
no
to
a
man
they
have
been
taught
to
read
to
a
man
they
have
been
instructed
to
know
and
dearer
than
life
to
prize
the
blessings
of
freedom
their
bodies
are
lying
behind
ditches
but
their
thoughts
are
on
the
wing
darting
through
eternity
the
warning
voice
of
god
still
rings
in
their
ears
the
hated
forms
of
proud
merciless
kings
pass
before
their
eyes
they
look
back
to
the
days
of
old
and
strengthen
themselves
as
they
think
what
their
gallant
forefathers
dared
for
liberty
and
for
them
they
looked
forward
to
their
own
dear
children
and
yearn
over
the
unoffending
millions
now
in
tearful
eyes
looking
up
to
them
for
protection
and
shall
this
infinite
host
of
deathless
beings
created
in
god
own
image
and
capable
by
virtue
and
equal
laws
of
endless
progression
in
glory
and
happiness
shall
they
be
arrested
in
their
high
career
and
from
the
freeborn
sons
of
god
be
degraded
into
the
slaves
of
man
maddening
at
the
accursed
thought
they
grasp
their
avenging
firelocks
and
drawing
their
sights
along
the
tubes
they
long
for
the
coming
up
of
the
british
thousands
three
times
the
british
thousands
came
up
and
three
times
the
dauntless
yeomen
waiting
their
near
approach
received
them
in
storms
of
thunder
and
lightning
that
shivered
their
ranks
and
heaped
the
field
with
their
weltering
carcasses
in
short
my
dear
sir
men
will
always
fight
for
their
government
according
to
their
sense
of
its
value
to
value
it
aright
they
must
understand
it
this
they
can
not
do
without
education
and
as
a
large
portion
of
the
citizens
are
poor
and
can
never
attain
that
inestimable
blessing
without
the
aid
of
government
it
is
plainly
the
first
duty
of
government
to
bestow
it
freely
upon
them
and
the
more
perfect
the
government
the
greater
the
duty
to
make
it
well
known
selfish
and
oppressive
governments
indeed
as
christ
observes
must
hate
the
light
and
fear
to
come
to
it
because
their
deeds
are
evil
but
a
fair
and
cheap
government
like
our
republic
longs
for
the
light
and
rejoices
to
come
to
the
light
that
it
may
be
manifested
to
be
from
god
and
well
worth
all
the
vigilance
and
valor
that
an
enlightened
nation
can
rally
for
its
defence
and
god
knows
a
good
government
can
hardly
ever
be
half
anxious
enough
to
give
its
citizens
a
thorough
knowledge
of
its
own
excellencies
for
as
some
of
the
most
valuable
truths
for
lack
of
careful
promulgation
have
been
lost
so
the
best
government
on
earth
if
not
duly
known
and
prized
may
be
subverted
ambitious
demagogues
will
rise
and
the
people
through
ignorance
and
love
of
change
will
follow
them
vast
armies
will
be
formed
and
bloody
battles
fought
and
after
desolating
their
country
with
all
the
horrors
of
civil
war
the
guilty
survivors
will
have
to
bend
their
necks
to
the
iron
yokes
of
some
stern
usurper
and
like
beasts
of
burden
to
drag
unpitied
those
galling
chains
which
they
have
riveted
upon
themselves
for
ever
this
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
was
the
substance
of
the
last
dialogue
i
ever
had
with
marion
it
was
spoken
with
an
emphasis
which
i
shall
never
forget
indeed
he
described
the
glorious
action
at
bunker
hill
as
though
he
had
been
one
of
the
combatants
his
agitation
was
great
his
voice
became
altered
and
broken
and
his
face
kindled
over
with
that
living
fire
with
which
it
was
wont
to
burn
when
he
entered
the
battles
of
his
country
i
arose
from
my
seat
as
he
spoke
and
on
recovering
from
the
magic
of
his
tongue
found
myself
bending
forward
to
the
voice
of
my
friend
and
my
right
hand
stretched
by
my
side
it
was
stretched
to
my
side
for
the
sword
that
was
wont
to
burn
in
the
presence
of
marion
when
battle
rose
and
the
crowding
foe
was
darkening
around
us
but
thanks
to
god
was
sweet
delusion
all
no
sword
hung
burning
by
my
side
no
crowding
foe
darkened
around
us
in
dust
or
in
chains
they
had
all
vanished
away
and
bright
in
his
scabbard
rested
the
sword
of
peace
in
my
own
pleasant
halls
on
winyaw
bay
chapter
the
death
of
marion
his
character
next
to
washington
o
glorious
shade
in
page
historic
shall
thy
name
have
place
deep
on
thy
country
memory
are
portrayed
those
gallant
deeds
which
time
shall
erase
ah
full
of
honors
and
of
years
farewell
thus
thy
tomb
shall
carolina
sigh
each
tongue
thy
valor
and
thy
worth
shall
tell
which
taught
the
young
to
fight
the
old
to
die
the
next
morning
i
set
out
for
my
plantation
on
winyaw
bay
marion
as
usual
accompanied
me
to
my
horse
and
at
parting
begged
i
would
come
and
see
him
again
soon
for
that
he
felt
he
had
not
long
to
stay
as
the
reader
may
suppose
i
paid
but
little
heed
to
this
expression
which
i
looked
on
as
no
more
than
the
common
cant
of
the
aged
but
i
soon
had
cause
to
remember
it
with
sorrow
for
i
had
been
but
a
few
weeks
at
home
before
opening
a
charleston
paper
i
found
in
a
mourning
column
the
death
of
general
marion
never
shall
i
forget
the
of
that
moment
never
forget
what
i
felt
when
first
i
learned
that
marion
was
no
more
though
the
grave
was
between
us
yet
his
beloved
image
seemed
to
appear
before
me
fresher
than
ever
all
our
former
friendships
all
our
former
wars
returned
but
alas
he
who
was
to
me
the
soul
of
all
the
rest
the
foremost
in
every
battle
the
dearest
at
every
feast
he
shall
return
no
more
oh
marion
my
friend
my
bursting
heart
seemed
to
say
and
art
thou
gone
shall
i
no
more
hear
that
voice
which
was
always
so
sweet
no
more
see
that
smile
which
awakened
up
such
joy
in
my
soul
must
that
beloved
form
be
lost
forever
among
the
clods
in
the
valley
and
those
godlike
virtues
shall
they
pass
away
like
the
empty
visions
of
the
night
from
this
deep
gloom
which
strong
atheistic
sorrow
had
poured
over
my
nerves
i
was
suddenly
roused
as
by
an
angel
touch
to
the
bright
hopes
of
religion
the
virtues
of
my
departed
friend
all
flashed
at
once
upon
my
kindling
thoughts
his
countenance
so
stern
with
honor
his
tongue
so
sacred
to
truth
that
heart
always
so
ready
to
meet
death
in
defence
of
the
injured
that
eye
ever
beaming
benevolence
to
man
and
that
whole
life
so
reverential
of
god
the
remembrance
i
say
of
all
these
things
came
in
streams
of
joy
to
my
heart
o
happy
marion
i
exclaimed
thou
art
safe
my
friend
thou
art
safe
no
tears
of
mine
shall
doubt
thy
blissful
state
surely
if
there
be
a
god
and
that
there
is
all
nature
cries
aloud
through
all
her
works
he
must
delight
in
virtue
and
what
he
delights
in
must
be
happy
then
it
was
that
i
felt
what
a
benefactor
marion
had
been
to
me
how
dear
his
company
while
living
how
sweet
his
memory
when
dead
like
the
sun
travelling
in
brightness
his
smiles
had
ever
been
my
joy
his
example
my
light
and
though
now
set
in
the
grave
yet
has
he
not
left
me
in
darkness
his
virtues
like
stars
are
lighted
up
after
him
they
point
my
hopes
to
the
path
of
glory
and
proclaim
that
though
fallen
he
is
not
extinguished
from
the
physicians
and
many
others
who
attended
him
in
his
last
illness
i
learned
that
he
had
died
as
he
had
lived
a
truly
great
man
his
chamber
was
not
as
is
usual
with
dying
persons
a
scene
of
gloom
and
silent
distress
but
rather
like
the
cheerful
parlor
of
one
who
was
setting
out
on
an
agreeable
journey
some
said
he
have
spoken
of
death
as
a
leap
in
the
dark
but
for
my
part
i
look
on
it
as
a
welcome
resting
place
where
virtuous
old
age
may
throw
down
his
pains
and
aches
wipe
off
his
old
scores
and
begin
anew
on
an
innocent
and
happy
state
that
shall
last
for
ever
what
weakness
to
wish
to
live
to
such
ghastly
dotage
as
to
frighten
the
children
and
make
even
the
dogs
to
bark
at
us
as
we
totter
along
the
streets
most
certainly
then
there
is
a
time
when
to
a
good
man
death
is
a
great
mercy
even
to
his
body
and
as
to
his
soul
why
should
he
tremble
about
that
who
can
doubt
that
god
created
us
to
be
happy
and
thereto
made
us
to
love
one
another
which
is
plainly
written
in
our
hearts
whose
every
thought
and
work
of
love
is
happiness
and
as
plainly
written
as
the
gospel
whose
every
line
breathes
love
and
every
precept
enjoins
good
works
now
the
man
who
has
spent
life
in
bravely
denying
himself
every
inclination
that
would
make
others
miserable
and
in
courageously
doing
all
in
his
power
to
make
them
happy
what
has
such
a
man
to
fear
from
death
or
rather
what
glorious
things
has
he
not
to
hope
from
it
hearing
one
of
his
friends
say
that
the
methodists
and
baptists
were
progressing
rapidly
in
some
parts
of
the
state
he
replied
well
thank
god
for
that
that
is
good
news
the
same
gentleman
then
asked
him
which
he
thought
was
the
best
religion
i
know
but
one
religion
he
answered
and
that
is
hearty
love
of
god
and
man
this
is
the
only
true
religion
and
i
would
to
god
our
country
was
full
of
it
for
it
is
the
only
spice
to
embalm
and
to
immortalize
our
republic
any
politician
can
sketch
out
a
fine
theory
of
government
but
what
is
to
bind
the
people
to
the
practice
archimedes
used
to
mourn
that
though
his
mechanic
powers
were
irresistible
yet
he
could
never
raise
the
world
because
he
had
no
place
in
the
heavens
whereon
to
fix
his
pullies
even
so
our
republic
will
never
be
raised
above
the
shameful
factions
and
miserable
end
of
all
other
governments
until
our
citizens
come
to
have
their
hearts
like
archimedes
pullies
fixed
on
heaven
the
world
sometimes
makes
such
bids
to
ambition
that
nothing
but
heaven
can
outbid
her
the
heart
is
sometimes
so
embittered
that
nothing
but
divine
love
can
sweeten
it
so
enraged
that
devotion
only
can
becalm
it
and
so
broke
down
that
it
takes
all
the
force
of
heavenly
hope
to
raise
it
in
short
religion
is
the
only
sovereign
and
controlling
power
over
man
bound
by
that
the
rulers
will
never
usurp
nor
the
people
rebel
the
former
will
govern
like
fathers
and
the
latter
obey
like
children
and
thus
moving
on
firm
and
united
as
a
host
of
brothers
they
will
continue
invincible
as
long
as
they
continue
virtuous
when
he
was
near
his
end
seeing
his
lady
weeping
by
his
bedside
he
gave
her
a
look
of
great
tenderness
and
said
my
dear
weep
not
for
me
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
for
thank
god
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
my
heart
and
say
that
since
i
came
to
man
estate
i
have
never
intentionally
done
wrong
to
any
these
were
nearly
his
last
words
for
shortly
after
uttering
them
he
closed
his
eyes
in
the
sleep
of
death
thus
peaceful
and
happy
was
the
end
of
general
francis
marion
of
whom
as
a
partisan
officer
general
greene
has
often
been
heard
to
say
that
the
page
of
history
never
furnished
his
equal
and
if
any
higher
praise
of
marion
were
necessary
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
very
remarkable
resemblance
between
him
and
the
great
washington
they
both
came
forward
volunteers
in
the
service
of
their
country
they
both
learned
the
military
art
in
the
hard
and
hazardous
schools
of
indian
warfare
they
were
both
such
true
soldiers
in
vigilance
that
no
enemy
could
ever
surprise
them
and
so
equal
in
undaunted
valor
that
nothing
could
ever
dishearten
them
while
as
to
the
still
nobler
virtues
of
patience
disinterestedness
severity
to
themselves
and
generosity
to
their
enemies
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
marion
or
washington
most
deserve
our
admiration
and
even
in
the
lesser
incidents
of
their
lives
the
resemblance
between
these
two
great
men
is
closer
than
common
they
were
both
born
in
the
same
year
both
lost
their
fathers
in
early
life
both
married
excellent
and
wealthy
ladies
both
left
widows
and
both
died
childless
the
name
of
marion
continues
dear
to
the
people
of
the
south
and
to
this
day
whenever
his
amiable
widow
rides
through
the
country
she
meets
the
most
pleasing
evidences
that
her
husband
though
dead
is
not
forgotten
the
wealthy
everywhere
treat
her
with
the
respect
due
to
a
mother
while
the
poor
gathering
around
her
carriage
often
press
to
shake
hands
with
her
then
looking
at
each
other
with
a
sigh
they
exclaim
that
the
widow
of
our
glorious
old
marion
