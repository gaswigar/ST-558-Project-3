chapter
i
the
summer
day
in
which
closed
the
annual
session
of
whitelaw
college
was
marked
by
a
special
ceremony
preceding
the
wonted
distribution
of
academic
rewards
at
eleven
in
the
morning
just
as
a
heavy
shower
fell
from
the
above
the
roaring
streets
the
municipal
authorities
educational
dignitaries
and
prominent
burgesses
of
kingsmill
assembled
on
an
open
space
before
the
college
to
unveil
a
statue
of
sir
job
whitelaw
the
honoured
baronet
had
been
six
months
dead
living
he
opposed
the
desire
of
his
to
exhibit
even
on
canvas
his
gnarled
features
and
bald
crown
but
when
his
modesty
ceased
to
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
no
time
was
lost
in
raising
a
memorial
of
the
great
manufacturer
the
millionaire
the
borough
member
in
three
parliaments
the
enlightened
and
benevolent
founder
of
an
institute
which
had
conferred
humane
distinction
on
the
midland
town
beneath
such
a
sky
orations
were
necessarily
curtailed
but
sir
job
had
always
been
impatient
of
much
talk
an
interval
of
two
or
three
hours
dispersed
the
and
bestowed
such
grace
of
sunshine
as
kingsmill
might
at
this
season
temperately
desire
then
whilst
the
marble
figure
was
getting
dried
with
which
already
foretold
its
negritude
of
a
year
hence
again
streamed
towards
the
college
a
varied
multitude
official
parental
pupillary
the
students
had
nothing
distinctive
in
their
garb
but
here
and
there
flitted
the
cap
and
gown
of
professor
or
lecturer
signal
for
doffing
of
beavers
along
the
line
of
its
progress
among
the
more
deliberate
of
the
throng
was
a
slender
upright
gentleman
of
middle
age
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
a
daughter
of
sixteen
on
alighting
from
a
carriage
they
first
of
all
directed
their
steps
towards
the
statue
conversing
together
with
pleasant
animation
the
father
martin
warricombe
esq
of
thornhaw
a
small
estate
some
five
miles
from
kingsmill
had
a
countenance
suggestive
of
engaging
qualities
genial
humour
mildness
a
turn
for
meditation
perhaps
for
study
his
attire
was
informal
as
if
he
disliked
abandoning
the
freedom
of
the
country
even
when
summoned
to
urban
ceremonies
he
wore
a
grey
felt
hat
and
a
light
jacket
which
displayed
the
straightness
of
his
shoulders
warricombe
and
her
daughter
were
more
fashionably
equipped
with
taste
which
proclaimed
their
social
standing
save
her
fresh
yet
delicate
complexion
the
lady
had
no
particular
personal
charm
of
the
young
girl
it
could
only
be
said
that
she
exhibited
a
graceful
immaturity
with
perchance
a
little
more
earnestness
than
is
common
at
her
age
her
voice
even
when
she
spoke
gaily
was
seldom
audible
save
by
the
person
addressed
coming
to
a
pause
before
sir
job
warricombe
put
on
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
which
had
dangled
against
his
waistcoat
and
began
to
scrutinise
carefully
the
sculptured
lineaments
he
was
addressing
certain
critical
remarks
to
his
companions
when
an
interruption
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
young
man
whose
first
words
announced
his
relation
to
the
group
say
you
very
late
there
be
no
getting
a
decent
seat
if
you
do
mind
leave
sir
job
till
afterwards
statue
somehow
disappoints
me
observed
his
father
placidly
it
is
bad
i
think
returned
the
youth
in
a
voice
not
unlike
his
father
save
for
a
note
of
excessive
he
looked
about
eighteen
his
comely
countenance
with
its
air
of
robust
health
and
habitual
exhilaration
told
of
a
boyhood
passed
amid
free
and
joyous
circumstances
it
was
the
face
of
a
young
english
plutocrat
with
more
of
intellect
than
such
visages
are
wont
to
betray
the
native
vigour
of
his
temperament
had
probably
assimilated
something
of
the
modern
spirit
glad
he
continued
they
have
stuck
him
in
a
toga
or
any
humbug
of
that
sort
the
old
fellow
looks
baggy
but
so
he
was
they
ought
to
have
kept
his
though
better
than
giving
him
those
scraps
of
hair
when
everyone
knows
he
was
as
bald
as
a
beetle
job
should
have
been
granted
caesar
privilege
said
warricombe
with
a
pleasant
twinkle
in
his
eyes
was
that
came
from
the
son
with
abrupt
indifference
shame
buckland
do
i
care
for
caesar
privileges
we
ca
burden
our
minds
with
that
antiquated
rubbish
nowadays
you
would
despise
it
yourself
father
if
it
had
got
packed
into
your
head
when
you
were
young
the
parent
raised
his
eyebrows
in
a
bantering
smile
have
lived
to
hear
classical
learning
called
antiquated
rubbish
well
well
ha
there
is
professor
gale
the
professor
of
geology
a
tall
man
who
strode
over
the
pavement
as
if
he
were
among
granite
hills
caught
sight
of
the
party
and
approached
his
greeting
was
that
of
a
familiar
friend
he
addressed
young
warricombe
and
his
sister
by
their
christian
names
and
inquired
after
certain
younger
members
of
the
household
mr
warricombe
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
repressed
eagerness
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
spoke
in
the
subdued
voice
of
one
who
has
important
news
to
communicate
i
am
not
much
mistaken
i
have
chanced
on
a
new
species
of
not
in
your
kitchen
garden
i
presume
dr
pollock
sent
me
a
box
of
specimens
the
other
day
buckland
saw
with
annoyance
the
likelihood
of
prolonged
discussion
do
know
whether
you
care
to
remain
standing
all
the
afternoon
he
said
to
his
mother
this
rate
we
certainly
sha
get
seats
will
walk
on
martin
said
the
lady
glancing
at
her
husband
come
we
come
cried
the
professor
with
a
wave
of
his
arm
the
palaeontological
talk
continued
as
far
as
the
entrance
of
the
assembly
hall
the
zest
with
which
warricombe
spoke
of
his
discovery
never
led
him
to
raise
his
voice
above
the
suave
mellow
note
touched
with
humour
which
expressed
a
modest
assurance
mr
gale
was
distinguished
by
a
blunter
mode
of
speech
he
discoursed
with
vigour
making
use
now
and
then
of
a
racy
colloquialism
which
the
other
would
hardly
have
permitted
himself
as
young
warricombe
had
foreseen
the
seats
obtainable
were
none
too
advantageous
only
on
one
of
the
highest
rows
of
the
amphitheatre
could
they
at
length
establish
themselves
will
enjoy
the
more
attention
when
he
marches
down
to
take
his
prizes
observed
the
father
must
sit
at
the
end
here
that
he
may
have
a
struggle
to
get
out
martin
do
urged
his
wife
considerately
it
does
affect
me
said
buckland
with
a
laugh
feel
pretty
sure
i
have
got
the
logic
and
the
chemistry
and
those
are
what
i
care
most
about
i
dare
say
peak
has
beaten
me
in
geology
the
appearance
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
of
a
procession
headed
by
the
tall
figure
of
the
principal
imposed
a
moment
silence
broken
by
outbursts
of
welcoming
applause
the
professors
of
whitelaw
college
were
highly
popular
not
alone
with
the
members
of
their
classes
but
with
all
the
educated
inhabitants
of
kingsmill
and
deservedly
for
several
of
them
bore
names
of
wide
recognition
and
as
a
body
they
did
honour
to
the
institution
which
had
won
their
services
with
becoming
formality
they
seated
themselves
in
face
of
the
public
on
tables
before
them
were
exposed
a
considerable
number
of
books
shortly
to
be
distributed
among
the
collegians
who
gazed
in
that
direction
with
speculative
eyes
among
the
general
concourse
might
have
been
discovered
two
or
three
representatives
of
the
multitude
which
kingsmill
depended
upon
for
its
prosperity
but
their
presence
was
due
to
exceptional
circumstances
the
college
provided
for
proletarian
education
by
a
system
of
evening
classes
a
curriculum
necessarily
quite
apart
from
that
followed
by
the
regular
students
kingsmill
to
be
sure
was
no
nurse
of
toryism
the
robust
employers
of
labour
who
sent
their
sons
to
whitelaw
either
to
complete
a
training
deemed
sufficient
for
an
active
career
or
by
way
of
between
school
and
university
were
for
the
most
part
avowed
radicals
in
theory
scornful
of
privilege
practically
supporters
of
that
mode
of
freedom
which
regards
life
as
a
remorseless
conflict
not
a
few
of
the
young
men
some
of
these
the
hardest
and
most
successful
workers
came
from
poor
homes
whence
but
for
sir
job
foundation
they
must
have
set
forth
into
the
world
with
no
better
equipment
of
knowledge
than
was
supplied
by
some
of
the
old
type
a
glance
distinguished
such
students
from
the
and
offspring
of
kingsmill
plutocracy
the
note
of
the
assembly
was
something
other
than
refinement
rather
its
high
standard
of
health
spirits
and
comfort
the
characteristic
of
capitalism
decent
reverence
for
learning
keen
appreciation
of
scientific
power
warm
liberality
of
thought
and
sentiment
within
appreciable
limits
enthusiasm
for
economic
civic
national
ideals
such
attributes
were
abundantly
discoverable
in
each
serried
row
from
the
expanse
of
countenances
beamed
a
boundless
to
be
connected
in
any
way
with
whitelaw
formed
a
subject
of
pride
seeing
that
here
was
the
sturdy
outcome
of
the
most
modern
educational
endeavour
a
noteworthy
instance
of
what
englishmen
can
do
for
themselves
unaided
by
bureaucratic
machinery
every
student
who
achieved
distinction
in
class
lists
was
felt
to
bestow
a
share
of
his
honour
upon
each
spectator
who
applauded
him
with
occasional
adjustment
of
his
and
smiling
his
smile
of
modest
tolerance
warricombe
surveyed
the
crowded
hall
his
connection
with
the
town
was
not
intimate
and
he
could
discover
few
faces
that
were
familiar
to
him
a
native
and
till
of
late
an
inhabitant
of
devon
he
had
come
to
reside
on
his
property
near
kingsmill
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
education
of
his
children
would
be
favoured
by
a
removal
thither
two
of
his
oldest
friends
held
professorships
at
whitelaw
here
accordingly
his
eldest
son
was
making
preparation
for
cambridge
whilst
his
daughter
attended
classes
at
the
admirable
high
school
of
which
kingsmill
was
only
less
proud
than
of
its
college
seated
between
his
father
and
his
sister
buckland
drew
their
attention
to
such
persons
or
personages
as
interested
his
very
selective
mind
the
elegant
languor
of
wotherspoon
he
remarked
indicating
the
professor
of
greek
him
for
a
moment
and
you
see
him
glance
contemptuously
at
old
plummer
he
ca
help
it
they
hate
each
other
why
whispered
the
girl
with
timid
eagerness
it
began
they
say
when
plummer
once
had
to
take
one
of
wotherspoon
classes
some
foolery
about
a
second
aorist
thank
goodness
i
do
understand
the
profound
oh
do
look
at
that
fatuous
idiot
chilvers
the
young
gentleman
of
whom
he
spoke
a
student
of
buckland
own
standing
had
just
attracted
general
notice
rising
from
his
seat
in
the
lower
part
of
the
amphitheatre
at
the
moment
when
all
were
hushed
in
anticipation
of
the
principal
address
chilvers
was
beckoning
to
someone
whom
his
eye
had
descried
at
great
distance
and
for
whom
as
he
indicated
by
gesture
he
had
preserved
a
place
how
it
delights
him
to
make
an
exhibition
of
himself
pursued
the
censorious
youth
bet
a
sovereign
he
arranged
it
all
look
how
he
brandishes
his
arm
to
display
his
cuffs
and
gold
links
now
he
touches
his
hair
to
point
out
how
light
and
exquisite
it
is
and
how
beautifully
he
parts
it
a
graceful
figure
murmured
warricombe
with
genuine
admiration
that
just
what
he
hopes
everyone
is
saying
replied
her
son
in
a
tone
of
laughing
disgust
he
certainly
is
graceful
buckland
persisted
the
lady
in
the
meantime
remarked
warricombe
drily
are
all
awaiting
the
young
gentleman
pleasure
course
he
enjoys
it
almost
all
the
people
on
that
row
belong
to
him
father
mother
sisters
brothers
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
to
the
fourth
degree
look
at
their
eyes
fondly
fixed
upon
him
now
he
pretends
to
loosen
his
collar
at
the
throat
just
for
a
change
of
attitude
the
puppy
dear
remonstrated
his
mother
with
apprehensive
glance
at
her
neighbours
he
is
really
clever
is
he
buckland
asked
the
sister
her
name
was
sidwell
a
fashion
i
should
wonder
if
he
takes
a
dozen
or
two
prizes
it
all
a
knack
you
know
is
your
friend
peak
warricombe
made
inquiry
but
at
this
moment
chilvers
abandoned
his
endeavour
and
became
seated
allowing
the
principal
to
rise
manuscript
in

buckland
leaned
back
with
an
air
of
resignation
to
boredom
his
father
bent
slightly
forward
with
lips
close
pressed
and
brows
wrinkled
mrs
warricombe
widened
her
eyes
as
if
hearing
were
performed
with
those
organs
and
assumed
the
smile
she
would
have
worn
had
the
speaker
been
addressing
her
in
particular
sidwell
blue
eyes
imitated
the
movement
of
her
mother
with
a
look
of
profound
gravity
which
showed
that
she
had
wholly
forgotten
herself
in
reverential
listening
only
when
five
minutes
strict
attention
induced
a
sense
of
weariness
did
she
allow
a
glance
to
stray
first
along
the
professorial
rank
then
towards
the
place
where
the
golden
head
of
young
chilvers
was
easily
distinguishable
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
than
the
annual
report
summarised
by
principal
nares
whose
mellifluous
voice
and
daintily
pedantic
utterance
fell
upon
expectant
hearing
with
the
impressiveness
of
personal
compliment
so
delivered
statistics
partook
of
the
grace
of
culture
details
of
academic
organisation
acquired
something
more
than
secular
significance
in
this
the
ninth
year
of
its
existence
whitelaw
college
was
flourishing
in
every
possible
way
private
beneficence
had
endowed
it
with
new
scholarships
and
exhibitions
the
scheme
of
lectures
had
been
extended
the
number
of
its
students
steadily
increased
and
their
successes
in
the
field
of
examination
had
been
noteworthy
beyond
precedent
truly
the
heart
of
their
founder
to
whom
honour
had
this
day
been
rendered
must
have
gladdened
if
he
could
but
have
listened
to
the
story
of
dignified
progress
applause
loud
and
long
greeted
the
close
of
the
address
buckland
warricombe
was
probably
the
only
collegian
who
disdained
to
manifest
approval
in
any
way
do
you
clap
asked
his
sister
who
was
excited
to
warmth
of
cheek
and
brightness
of
eye
by
the
enthusiasm
about
her
kind
of
thing
is
out
of
date
replied
the
young
man
thrusting
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
as
professor
of
logic
and
moral
philosophy
dr
nares
began
the
distribution
of
prizes
buckland
in
spite
of
his
resolve
to
exhibit
no
weakness
waited
with
unmistakable
tremor
for
the
announcement
of
the
leading
name
which
might
possibly
be
his
own
a
few
words
of
comment
prefaced
the
declaration
never
had
it
been
the
professor
lot
to
review
more
admirable
papers
than
those
to
which
he
had
awarded
the
first
prize
the
name
of

upon
to
come
forward

from

warricombe
glanced
at
her
son
with
smiling
sympathy
sidwell
whose
cheek
had
paled
as
her
nerves
quivered
under
the
stress
of
expectancy
murmured
a
syllable
of
disappointment
warricombe
set
his
brows
and
did
not
venture
to
look
aside
a
moment
and
all
eyes
were
directed
upon
the
successful
student
who
rose
from
a
seat
down
the
hall
and
descended
the
middle
passage
towards
the
row
of
professors
he
was
a
young
man
of
spare
figure
and
unhealthy
complexion
his
age
not
easily
conjectured
embarrassment
no
doubt
accounted
for
much
of
the
awkwardness
of
his
demeanour
but
under
any
circumstances
he
must
have
appeared
ungainly
for
his
long
arms
and
legs
had
outgrown
their
garments
which
were
no
fashionable
specimens
of
tailoring
the
nervous
gravity
of
his
countenance
had
a
peculiar
sternness
one
might
have
imagined
that
he
was
fortifying
his
with
scorn
of
the
elegantly
clad
people
through
whom
he
passed
amid
plaudits
he
received
from
the
hands
of
the
principal
a
couple
of
solid
volumes
probably
some
standard
work
of
philosophy
and
thus
burdened
returned
with
hurried
step
to
his
place
one
expected
that
remarked
buckland
to
his
father
must
have
crammed
furiously
for
the
exam
it
outside
his
work
for
the
first
a
shame
sidwell
whispered
to
her
mother
and
the
reply
was
a
look
which
eloquently
expressed
warricombe
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
victor
but
a
second
prize
had
been
awarded
as
soon
as
silence
was
restored
the
principal
gracious
voice
delivered
a
summons
to
martin
warricombe
a
burst
of
acclamation
coming
especially
from
that
part
of
the
amphitheatre
where
whitelaw
nurslings
had
gathered
in
greatest
numbers
seemed
to
declare
the
second
prizeman
distinctly
more
popular
than
the
first
preferences
of
this
kind
are
always
to
be
remarked
on
such
occasions
prize
be
hanged
growled
the
young
man
as
with
a
flush
of
shame
on
his
ruddy
countenance
he
set
forth
to
receive
the
honour
leaving
warricombe
convulsed
with
silent
laughter
would
far
rather
have
had
nothing
at
all
murmured
sidwell
who
shared
her
brother
pique
and
humiliation
it
do
him
good
was
her
father
reply
has
got
into
a
way
of
swaggering
undeniable
was
the
swagger
with
which
the
breezy
lad
went
and
returned
is
the
book
inquired
warricombe
do
oh
mill
idiotic
choice
they
might
have
known
i
had
it
already
clap
him
far
more
than
they
did
mr
peak
sidwell
whispered
to
her
mother
with
satisfaction
buckland
kept
silence
for
a
few
minutes
then
muttered
nothing
i
care
about
now
till
chemistry
and
geology
here
comes
old
wotherspoon
now
we
shall
know
who
is
strongest
in
second
aorists
i
should
wonder
if
peak
takes
both
senior
greek
and
latin
i
heartily
hope
he
beat
that
ass
chilvers
but
the
name
so
offensive
to
young
warricombe
was
the
first
that
issued
from
the
professor
lips
beginning
with
the
competition
for
a
special
classical
prize
professor
wotherspoon
announced
that
the
honours
had
fallen
to
leathwaite
chilvers
young
man
is
not
badly
supplied
with
brains
say
what
you
will
remarked
warricombe
upon
bruno
leathwaite
chilvers
keen
attention
was
directed
every
pair
of
female
eyes
studied
his
graces
and
female
hands
had
a
great
part
in
the
applause
that
greeted
his
arising
applause
different
in
kind
from
that
hitherto
bestowed
less
noisy
but
implying
one
felt
a
more
delicate
spirit
of
commendation
with
perfect
with
singular
facial
decorum
with
a
walk
which
betokened
elegant
athleticism
and
safely
skirted
the
bounds
of
foppery
chilvers
discharged
the
duty
he
was
conscious
of
owing
to
a
multitude
of
kinsfolk
friends
admirers
you
would
have
detected
something
clerical
in
the
young
man
air
it
became
the
son
of
a
popular
clergyman
and
gave
promise
of
notable
aptitude
for
the
sacred
career
to
which
bruno
leathwaite
as
was
well
understood
already
had
designed
himself
in
matters
sartorial
he
presented
a
high
ideal
to
his
this
seemly
attention
to
externals
and
the
delicate
glow
of
health
discernible
through
the
golden
down
of
his
cheeks
testified
the
compatibility
of
hard
study
and
social
observances
bruno
had
been
heard
to
say
that
the
one
thing
it
behoved
whitelaw
to
keep
carefully
in
mind
was
the
preservation
of
a
quality
far
less
easy
to
cultivate
than
mere
academic
excellence
clever
he
must
be
purred
warricombe
he
lives
he
will
some
day
be
an
archbishop
buckland
was
leaning
back
with
his
eyes
closed
disgusted
at
the
spectacle
nor
did
he
move
when
professor
wotherspoon
voice
made
the
next
announcement
senior
greek
the
first
prize
is
taken
by
bruno
leathwaite
chilvers
i
suppose
peak
comes
second
muttered
buckland
so
it
proved
summoned
to
receive
the
inferior
prize
godwin
peak
his
countenance
harsher
than
before
his
eyes
cast
down
moved
ungracefully
to
the
estrade
and
during
the
next
this
twofold
exhibition
was
several
times
repeated
in
senior
latin
in
modern
and
ancient
history
in
english
language
and
literature
in
french
first
sounded
the
name
of
chilvers
whilst
to
the
second
award
was
invariably
attached
that
of
peak
warricombe
delight
expressed
itself
in
every
permissible
way
on
each
occasion
she
exclaimed
clever
he
is
sidwell
cast
frequent
glances
at
her
brother
in
whom
a
shrewder
eye
could
have
divined
conflict
of
feelings
disgust
at
the
glorification
of
chilvers
and
involuntary
pleasure
in
the
successive
defeats
of
his
own
conqueror
in
philosophy
buckland
was
by
no
means
an
ignoble
face
venial
malice
did
not
ultimately
prevail
in
him
peak
own
fault
he
declared
at
length
with
vexation
stuck
to
the
subjects
of
his
course
peak
has
been
taking
up
extras
and
they
done
for
him
i
should
wonder
if
he
went
in
for
the
poem
and
the
essay
i
know
he
was
thinking
about
both
whether
godwin
peak
had
or
had
not
endeavoured
for
these
two
prizes
remained
uncertain
when
presently
the
results
of
the
competition
were
made
known
it
was
found
that
in
each
case
the
honour
had
fallen
to
a
young
man
hitherto
undistinguished
his
name
was
john
edward
earwaker
externally
he
bore
a
sort
of
generic
resemblance
to
peak
for
his
face
was
thin
and
the
fashion
of
his
clothing
indicated
narrow
means
never
heard
you
mention
him
said
warricombe
turning
to
his
son
with
an
air
of
surprise
scarcely
know
him
at
all
he
only
in
one
or
two
of
my
classes
peak
is
thick
with
him
the
subject
of
the
prize
poem
was
that
of
the
essay
unionism
so
it
was
probable
that
john
edward
earwaker
did
not
lack
versatility
of
intellect
on
the
rising
of
the
professor
of
chemistry
buckland
had
once
more
to
subdue
signs
of
expectancy
he
knew
he
had
done
good
papers
but
his
confidence
in
the
result
was
now
clouded
by
a
dread
of
the
second
prize
which
indeed
fell
to
him
the
first
being
taken
by
a
student
of
no
account
save
in
this
very
special
subject
keen
was
his
mortification
he
growled
muttered
shrugged
his
shoulders
nervously
i
had
foreseen
this
you
never
have
caught
me
here
was
his
reply
when
sidwell
whispered
consolation
there
still
remained
a
chance
for
him
signalled
by
the
familiar
form
of
professor
gale
geology
had
been
a
lifelong
study
with
martin
warricombe
and
his
son
pursued
it
with
hereditary
aptitude
sidwell
and
her
mother
exchanged
a
look
of
courageous
hope
each
felt
convinced
that
the
genial
professor
could
not
so
far
disregard
private
feeling
as
to
place
buckland
anywhere
but
at
the
head
of
the
class
results
of
the
examination
are
fairly
good
i
afraid
i
ca
say
more
than
that
thus
rang
out
gale
hearty
voice
for
the
first
two
names
on
my
list
i
have
felt
justified
in
placing
either
before
the
other
i
have
bracketed
them
and
there
will
be
two
prizes
the
names
are
godwin
peak
and
buckland
martin
warricombe
might
have
mentioned
buckland
first
murmured
warricombe
resentfully
of
course
gave
them
out
in
alphabetical
order
answered
her
husband
it
is
right
that
buckland
should
come
second
absurd
was
the
reply
the
lady
of
course
remained
unconvinced
and
for
years
she
nourished
a
pique
against
professor
gale
not
so
much
owing
to
his
having
bracketed
her
son
as
because
the
letter
p
has
alphabetical
precedence
of
in
what
remained
of
the
proceedings
the
warricombes
had
no
personal
interest
for
a
special
reason
however
their
attention
was
excited
by
the
rising
of
professor
walsh
who
represented
the
science
of
physics
early
in
the
present
year
had
been
published
a
speculative
treatise
which
owing
to
its
supposed
incompatibility
with
christian
dogmas
provoked
much
controversy
and
was
largely
discussed
in
all
educated
circles
the
work
was
anonymous
but
a
rumour
which
gained
general
currency
attributed
it
to
professor
walsh
in
the
year
an
imputation
of
religious
heresy
was
not
lightly
to
be
incurred
by
a
professor
even
professor
of
physics
at
an
english
college
there
were
many
people
in
kingsmill
who
considered
that
walsh
delay
in
repudiating
so
grave
a
charge
rendered
very
doubtful
the
propriety
of
his
retaining
the
chair
at
whitelaw
significant
was
the
dispersed
applause
which
followed
slowly
upon
his
stepping
forward
on
the
professor
face
was
perchance
legible
something
like
a
hint
of
amused
defiance
ladies
had
ceased
to
beam
they
glanced
meaningly
at
one
another
and
then
from
under
their
eyelids
at
the
supposed
heretic
fine
fellow
walsh
exclaimed
buckland
clapping
vigorously
his
father
smiled
but
with
some
uneasiness
warricombe
whispered
to
sidwell
a
very
disagreeable
face
the
only
one
of
the
professors
who
does
seem
a
gentleman
the
girl
was
aware
of
dark
reports
affecting
walsh
reputation
she
hazarded
only
a
brief
examination
of
his
features
and
looked
at
the
applauding
buckland
with
alarm
lectures
are
splendid
said
her
brother
emphatically
i
were
going
to
be
here
next
session
i
should
take
them
for
some
minutes
after
the
professor
return
to
his
seat
a
susurration
was
audible
throughout
the
hall
bonnets
bent
together
and
beards
exchanged
curt
comments
the
ceremony
as
is
usual
with
all
ceremonies
grew
wearisome
before
its
end
buckland
was
deep
in
one
of
the
chapters
of
his
geologic
prize
when
the
last
speaker
closed
the
last
report
and
left
the
assembly
free
to
disperse
then
followed
the
season
of
congratulations
professors
students
and
the
friendly
public
mingled
in
a
a
nucleus
of
vivacious
intercourse
formed
at
the
spot
where
young
chilvers
stood
amid
trophies
of
examinational
prowess
when
his
numerous
relatives
had
all
shaken
hands
with
him
and
laughed
smiled
or
smirked
their
felicitations
they
made
way
for
the
press
of
eager
acquaintances
his
prize
library
was
reverently
surveyed
and
many
were
the
sportive
sallies
elicited
by
the
victor
obvious
inability
to
carry
away
what
he
had
won
suavely
exultant
ready
with
his
reply
to
every
flattering
address
bruno
chilvers
exhibited
a
social
tact
in
advance
of
his
years
it
was
easy
to
imagine
what
he
would
become
when
oxford
terms
and
the
seal
of
ordination
had
matured
his
youthful
promise
at
no
great
distance
stood
his
competitor
godwin
peak
embarrassed
he
also
with
wealth
of
spoils
but
about
this
young
man
was
no
concourse
of
admiring
kinsfolk
no
lady
offered
him
her
hand
or
shaped
compliments
for
him
with
gracious
lips
among
them
john
earwaker
talked
in
his
vicinity
of
the
day
results
peak
part
in
the
gossip
was
small
and
when
he
smiled
it
was
in
a
forced
anxious
way
with
brief
raising
of
his
eyes
for
a
moment
only
was
the
notice
of
a
wider
circle
directed
upon
him
when
dr
nares
moving
past
with
a
train
of
colloquial
attendants
turned
aside
to
repeat
his
praise
of
the
young
man
achievements
in
philosophy
he
bestowed
a
kindly
shake
of
the
hand
and
moved
on
the
warricombe
group
descended
in
purposeless
fashion
towards
the
spot
where
chilvers
held
his
court
their
personal
acquaintance
with
bruno
and
his
family
was
slight
and
though
warricombe
would
gladly
have
pushed
forward
to
claim
recognition
natural
diffidence
restrained
her
sidwell
kept
in
the
rear
risking
now
and
then
a
glance
of
vivid
curiosity
on
either
hand
buckland
striving
not
to
look
petulant
or
sullen
allowed
himself
to
be
led
on
but
when
he
became
aware
of
the
tendency
a
protest
broke
from
him
no
need
to
swell
that
fellow
conceit
here
father
come
and
have
a
word
with
peak
he
looks
rather
down
in
the
mouth
among
his
second
prizes
warricombe
having
beckoned
his
companions
they
reluctantly
followed
to
the
more
open
part
of
the
hall
very
generous
of
buckland
fell
from
the
lady
lips
and
she
at
length
resolved
to
show
an
equal
magnanimity
peak
and
earwaker
were
conversing
together
when
buckland
broke
in
upon
them
with
genial
outburst
it
peak
what
do
you
mean
by
getting
me
stuck
into
a
bracket
had
the
same
question
to
as
returned
the
other
with
a
grim
smile
warricombe
came
up
with
extended
hand
species
of
bracket
he
remarked
smiling
benevolently
no
algebraic
process
will
remove
let
us
hope
it
signifies
that
you
and
buckland
will
work
through
life
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
field
of
geology
what
did
professor
gale
give
you
before
he
could
reply
peak
had
to
exchange
greetings
with
mrs
warricombe
and
her
daughter
only
once
hitherto
had
he
met
them
six
months
ago
he
had
gone
out
with
buckland
to
the
and
passed
an
afternoon
there
making
at
the
time
no
very
favourable
impression
on
his
hostess
he
was
not
of
the
young
men
who
easily
insinuate
themselves
into
ladies
affections
his
exterior
was
against
him
and
he
seemed
too
conscious
of
his
disadvantages
in
that
particular
warricombe
found
it
difficult
to
shape
a
few
civil
phrases
for
the
acceptance
of
the
saturnine
student
sidwell
repelled
and
in
a
measure
alarmed
by
his
bilious
countenance
could
do
no
more
than
grant
him
her
delicately
gloved
fingers
peak
for
his
part
had
nothing
to
say
he
did
not
even
affect
an
interest
in
these
persons
and
turned
his
eyes
to
follow
the
withdrawing
earwaker
warricombe
however
had
found
topic
for
discourse
in
the
prize
volume
he
began
to
comment
on
the
excellence
of
certain
sections
of
the
book
you
go
home
interrupted
buckland
addressing
the
question
to
his
rival
do
you
stay
in
kingsmill
until
the
first
shall
go
home
replied
peak
moving
uneasily
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
thornhaw
when
you
are
up
again
for
the
examination
said
warricombe
with
faltering
tongue
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
come
thank
you
was
the
awkward
response
buckland
voice
came
to
the
relief
daresay
i
may
look
in
upon
you
at
your
torture
good
luck
old
fellow
if
we
do
see
each
other
again
write
to
me
at
trinity
before
the
end
of
the
year
as
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
remote
warricombe
ejaculated
in
a
subdued
voice
of
irritation
a
very
unprepossessing
young
man
i
never
met
he
seems
to
have
no
breeding
whatever
with
brains
replied
her
husband
adding
to
himself
by
no
means
so
with
money
i
fear
opportunity
at
length
offering
warricombe
stepped
into
the
circle
irradiated
by
bruno
chilvers
her
husband
and
sidwell
pressed
after
buckland
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
went
off
to
criticise
the
hero
among
a
group
of
his
particular
friends
godwin
peak
stood
alone
on
the
bench
where
he
had
sat
were
heaped
the
prize
volumes
eleven
in
all
some
of
them
massive
and
his
wish
was
to
make
arrangements
for
their
removal
gazing
about
him
he
became
aware
of
the
college
librarian
with
whom
he
was
on
friendly
terms
poppleton
who
would
pack
and
send
these
books
away
for
me
de
laughed
the
librarian
you
like
to
tell
the
porter
to
take
care
of
them
for
the
present
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
that
they
are
sent
wherever
you
like
peak
answered
with
a
warmth
of
acknowledgment
which
seemed
to
imply
that
he
did
not
often
receive
kindnesses
before
long
he
was
free
to
leave
the
college
and
at
the
exit
he
overtook
earwaker
who
carried
a
brown
paper
parcel
and
have
some
tea
with
me
across
the
way
will
you
said
the
literary
prizeman
have
a
couple
of
hours
to
wait
for
my
train
right
i
envy
you
that
spenser
wish
they
had
given
me
five
authors
i
do
possess
instead
i
think
i
shall
sell
this
earwaker
laughed
as
he
said
it
a
strange
chuckle
from
deep
down
in
his
throat
a
comparison
of
the
young
men
as
they
walked
side
by
side
showed
that
peak
was
of
better
physical
type
than
his
comrade
earwaker
had
a
slight
unshapely
body
and
an
head
he
walked
with
excessive
strides
and
swung
his
thin
arm
nervously
probably
he
was
the
elder
of
the
two
and
he
looked
twenty
for
peak
disadvantages
of
person
his
studious
bashfulness
and
poverty
of
attire
were
mainly
responsible
with
improvement
in
general
health
even
his
features
might
have
a
tolerable
comeliness
or
at
all
events
would
not
be
disagreeable
earwaker
visage
was
homely
and
seemed
the
more
so
for
his
sprouting
moustache
and
beard
you
heard
any
talk
about
walsh
the
latter
inquired
as
they
walked
on
peak
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
laugh
have
you
women
in
front
of
me
just
now
discussing
him
i
heard
how
shocking
and
disgraceful
peak
eyes
flashed
and
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
wrath
idiots
how
i
wish
i
were
in
walsh
position
how
i
should
enjoy
standing
up
before
the
crowd
of
fools
and
seeing
their
fear
of
me
but
i
could
keep
it
to
myself
i
should
give
in
to
the
temptation
to
call
them
blockheads
and
jackasses
earwaker
was
amused
at
his
friend
vehemence
he
sympathised
with
it
but
had
an
unyouthful
sobriety
in
the
expression
of
his
feelings
likely
he
despises
them
far
too
much
to
be
disturbed
by
what
they
think
of
him
but
i
say
is
it
desperately
comical
that
one
human
being
can
hate
and
revile
another
because
they
think
differently
about
the
origin
of
the
universe
could
you
roar
with
laughter
when
thought
over
it
for
a
moment
you
be
damned
for
your
theory
of
irregular
verbs
is
nothing
to
it
and
he
uttered
his
croak
of
mirth
whilst
peak
with
distorted
features
laughed
in
rage
and
scorn
they
had
crossed
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
college
buildings
and
were
issuing
into
the
highway
when
a
voice
very
unlike
those
that
were
wont
to
sound
within
the
academic
precincts
or
indeed
in
the
streets
of
kingsmill
made
sudden
demand
upon
peak
attention
you
godwin
thoughts
i
it
must
be
goes
it
my
you
reckonise
me
i
dessay
and
i
could
be
sure
as
it
was
you
till
i
a
good
squint
at
yer
i
jest
called
round
at
your
lodgin
and
they
towld
me
as
you
was
at
the
collige
he
who
thus
accosted
the
student
with
the
most
offensive
purity
of
cockney
accent
was
a
man
of
dressed
in
a
new
suit
of
tweeds
the
folding
crease
strongly
marked
down
the
front
of
the
trousers
and
the
coat
sleeves
rather
too
long
his
face
bore
a
strong
impress
of
vulgarity
but
at
the
same
time
had
a
certain
ingenuousness
a
energy
and
simplicity
which
saved
it
from
being
wholly
repellent
the
brow
was
narrow
the
eyes
small
and
bright
and
the
coarse
lips
half
hid
themselves
under
a
struggling
reddish
growth
in
these
lineaments
lurked
a
family
resemblance
to
godwin
peak
sufficient
to
support
a
claim
of
kindred
which
at
this
moment
might
have
seemed
improbable
at
the
summons
of
recognition
godwin
stood
transfixed
his
arms
fell
straight
and
his
head
drew
back
as
if
to
avoid
a
blow
for
an
instant
he
was
clay
colour
then
a
hot
flush
broke
upon
his
cheeks
sha
be
able
to
go
with
you
he
said
in
a
thick
abrupt
voice
addressing
earwaker
but
not
regarding
him
the
other
offered
his
hand
and
without
speaking
walked
away
at
the
collige
they
tell
me
pursued
godwin
relative
looking
at
a
cluster
of
people
that
passed
you
took
or
two
replied
the
student
his
eyes
on
the
ground
we
walk
to
my
lodgings

you

over
the

along
my
i
stand
treat
godwin
glanced
about
him
from
the
college
was
approaching
what
seemed
to
be
a
formal
procession
it
consisted
of
bruno
chilvers
supported
on
either
hand
by
ladies
and
followed
by
an
admiring
train
had
better
come
to
my
lodgings
with
me
uncle
said
the
young
man
hurriedly
moving
forward
no
i
wo
be
no
expense
to
you
godwin
and
i
a
reason
for
wantin
to
go
to
the
little
shop
opposyte
already
several
collegians
had
passed
giving
peak
a
nod
and
scanning
his
companion
a
moment
delay
and
chilvers
would
be
upon
him
without
another
word
godwin
moved
across
the
broad
street
to
the
place
of
refreshment
which
his
uncle
had
indicated
and
whither
earwaker
had
preceded
them
it
was
a
occasionally
visited
by
the
alumni
of
whitelaw
in
the
rear
of
the
shop
a
little
room
offered
seats
and
tables
and
here
godwin
knew
earwaker
would
be
found
us
go
he
said
leading
to
a
side
entrance
a
quieter
room
you
are
the
uncle
his
name
was
andrew
peak
paused
to
make
a
survey
of
the
premises
when
he
entered
his
scrutiny
of
the
establishment
was
close
and
he
seemed
to
reflect
with
interest
upon
all
he
saw
the
upper
room
was
empty
a
long
table
exhibited
knives
and
forks
but
there
were
no
signs
of
active
business
andrew
pulled
a
the
summons
was
answered
by
an
asthmatic
woman
who
received
an
order
for
tea
toast
and
sundry
other
constituents
of
a
modest
meal
often
godwin
inquired
andrew
as
he
stood
by
the
window
and
mused
and
then
for
a
bun
custom
from
your
show
over
the
wye
so
much
as
a
better
place
would
have
gents
do
live
at
the
collige
they
tell
me
there
no
residence
naturally
they
want
a
plyce
where
they
can
a
nibble
somewheres
we
have
to
go
further
into
the
town
for
a
decent
dinner
what
i
thought
exclaimed
andrew
slapping
his
leg
a
establishment
like
that
opposyte
there
ought
to
be
a
spiers
pond
at
this
street
corner
for
any
man
as
knows
wye
about
that
idea
godwin
see
peak
had
as
yet
given
but
half
an
ear
to
his
relative
discourse
he
had
answered
mechanically
and
only
now
was
constrained
to
serious
attention
by
a
note
of
meaning
in
the
last
interrogative
he
looked
at
the
speaker
and
andrew
in
the
manner
of
one
accustomed
to
regard
life
as
a
game
of
cunning
first
winked
with
each
eye
then
extended
one
cheek
with
the
pressure
of
his
tongue
sickened
with
disgust
godwin
turned
suddenly
away
a
movement
entirely
lost
upon
his
uncle
who
imagined
the
young
man
to
be
pondering
a
fruitful
suggestion
do
mind
tellin
you
godwin
pursued
andrew
presently
in
a
cautious
voice
laying
an
open
hand
against
his
i
been
pretty
good
business
lytely
been
growin
a
bit
see
i
runnin
round

about
down
to
the
ground
i
cut
out
for
it
see
i
got
the
practical
experience
and
i
got
the
capital
and
as
soon
as
i
got
a
squint
of
this
little
corner
shop
understand
what
i
mean
his
eyes
gleamed
with
eagerness
which
was
too
candid
for
the
typically
vulgar
mind
in
his
he
exhibited
a
gross
cordiality
which
might
have
made
rather
an
agreeable
impression
on
a
person
otherwise
disinterested
at
this
point
the
asthmatic
woman
reappeared
carrying
a
laden
tray
andrew
at
once
entered
into
conversation
with
her
framing
his
remarks
and
queries
so
as
to
learn
all
he
could
concerning
the
state
of
the
business
and
the
disposition
of
its
proprietors
his
nephew
meanwhile
stung
to
the
core
with
shame
kept
apart
as
if
amusing
himself
with
the
prospect
from
the
window
until
summoned
to
partake
of
the
meal
his
uncle
expressed
contempt
of
everything
laid
before
them
ai
no
wye
of
caterin
for
young
gents
at
collige
he
exclaimed
there
ai
a
openin
then
i
never

godwin
much
longer
it
be
before
you
out
of
time
over

this
little
shop
or
another
like
it
close
by
me
an
you
might
come
to
an
understandin
see
it
might
be
worth
your
while
to
give
a
to
the
young
gents
as
you
in
with
eh
godwin
was
endeavouring
to
masticate
a
piece
of
toast
but
it
turned
to
sawdust
upon
his
palate
of
a
sudden
when
the
bilious
gloom
of
his
countenance
foretold
anything
but
mirth
he
burst
into
hard
laughter
andrew
smote
him
jovially
on
the
back
you
eh
peak
refreshment
an
dinin
rooms
everything
mind
respectable
business
godwin
nothing
for
nobody
to
be
ashamed
of
would
do
of
course
the
young
man
laughter
ended
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
but
his
visage
was
no
longer
clouded
with
bitter
misery
a
strange
indifference
seemed
to
have
come
upon
him
and
whilst
the
speculative
uncle
talked
away
with
increasing
excitement
he
ate
and
drank
heedlessly
expects
you
she
tells
me
said
andrew
when
his
companion
taciturnity
had
suggested
a
change
of
topic
wonder
if
you
see
me
over
at
twybridge
again
before
long
i
was
to
remember
your
awnt
and
your
cousin
jowey
to
you
you
would
know
jowey
the
sharpest
lad
of
his
age
as
ever
i
knowed
is
jowey
your
father
a
took
a
delight
in
if
lived
that
would
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
the
dialogue
was
concerned
with
domestic
history
godwin
gave
brief
reply
to
many
questions
but
asked
none
not
even
such
as
civility
required
the
elder
man
however
was
unaffected
by
this
reticence
and
when
at
length
his
nephew
pleaded
an
engagement
as
excuse
for
he
shook
hands
with
much
warmth
the
two
parted
close
by
the
shop
and
godwin
casting
a
glance
at
the
now
silent
college
walked
hastily
towards
his
lodgings

of
between

of

of

or
more

the
honour
of
paying

there
were
none
and
families
supporting
life
on

might
in
some
cases
perchance
be
reconciled
to
the
mulct
by
considering
how
equitably
its
incidence
was
graduated
some
on
the

household
consisting
of
nicholas
peak
his
wife
their
daughter
their
son
and
a
blind
sister
of
nicholas
dependent
upon
him
for
sustenance
mr
peak
aged
thirty
and
now
four
years
wedded
had
a
small
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
greenwich
he
was
employed
as
dispenser
at
a
salary
of
shillings
a
week
by
a
medical
man
with
a
large
practice
his
income
therefore
fell
considerably
within
the
hundred
pound
limit
and
all
things
considered
it
was
not
unreasonable
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
expend
the
whole
of
this
sum
on
domestic
necessities
but
it
came
to
pass
that
nicholas
in
his
greed
of
wealth
obtained
supplementary
employment
which
benefited
him
to
the
extent
of
a
yearly

pounds
called
upon
to
render
his
statement
to
the
surveyor
of
he
declared
himself
in
possession
of
a
hundred

one
pounds
per
annum
consequently
he
stood
indebted
to
the
exchequer
in
the
sum
of
four
pounds
sixteen
shillings
and
ninepence
his
countenance
darkened
as
also
did
that
of

wrong
and
cruel
dreadfully
cruel
cried
the
latter
with
tears
in
her
eyes

but
that
no
new

was
the
bitter
reply
think
it
wrong
of
nicholas
what
need
is
there
to
say
anything
about
that

taking
the

out
of

mr

sternly

ca
sign
my

to

picture
the
man
tall
gaunt
with
sharp
intellectual
features
and
eyes
of
singular
beauty
the
face
of
an
enthusiast
under
given
circumstances
of
a
hero
poorly
clad
of
course
but
with
rigorous
his
boots
polished
to
the
point
of
perfection
his
linen
washed
and
ironed
by
the
indefatigable
wife
of
simplest
tastes
of
most
frugal
habits
a
few

the
only
luxury
which
he
deemed
indispensable
yet
a
most
difficult
man
to
live
with
for
to
him
applied
precisely
the
description
which
robert
burns
gave
of
his
own
father
he
was
stubborn
ungainly
integrity
and
headlong
irascibility
ungainly
for
his
strong
impulses
towards
culture
were
powerless
to
obliterate
the
traces
of
his
rude
origin
born
in
a
london
alley
the
son
of
a
labourer
burdened
with
a
large
family
he
had
made
his
way
by
sheer
force
of
character
to
a
position
which
would
have
seemed
proud
success
but
for
the
difficulty
with
which
he
kept
himself
alive
his
parents
were
dead
of
his
brothers
two
had
disappeared
in
the
abyss
and
one
andrew
earned
a
hard
livelihood
as
a
journeyman
baker
the
elder
of
his
sisters
had
married
poorly
and
the
younger
was
his
blind
pensioner
nicholas
had
found
a
wife
of
better
birth
than
his
own
a
young
woman
with
country
kindred
in
decent
circumstances
though
she
herself
served
as
nursemaid
in
the
house
of
the
medical
man
who
employed
her
future
husband
he
had
taught
himself
the
english
language
so
far
as
grammar
went
but
could
not
cast
off
the
london
accent
mrs
peak
was
fortunate
enough
to
speak
with
nothing
worse
than
the
note
of
the
midlands
his
bent
led
him
to
the
study
of
history
politics
economics
and
in
that
time
of
military
outbreak
he
was
frenzied
by
the
conflict
of
his
ideals
with
the
state
of
things
about
him
a
book
frequently
in
his
hands
was
godwin
and
when
a
son
had
been
born
to
him
he
decided
to
name
the
child
after
that
favourite
author
in
this
way
at
all
events
he
could
find
some
expression
for
his
hot
defiance
of
iniquity
he
paid
his
and
felt
a
savage
joy
in
the
privation
thus
imposed
upon
his
family
mrs
peak
could
not
forgive
her
husband
and
in
this
case
though
she
had
but
dim
appreciation
of
the
point
of
honour
involved
her
censures
doubtless
fell
on
nicholas
vulnerable
spot
it
was
the
perversity
of
arrogance
at
least
as
much
as
honesty
that
impelled
him
to
incur
taxation
his
wife
perseverance
in
complaint
drove
him
to
stern
impatience
and
for
a
long
time
the
peace
of
the
household
suffered
when
the
boy
godwin
was
five
years
old
the
death
of
his
blind
aunt
came
as
a
relief
to
means
which
were
in
every
sense
overtaxed
twelve
months
later
a
piece
of
unprecedented
good
fortune
seemed
to
place
the
peaks
beyond
fear
of
want
and
at
the
same
time
to
supply
nicholas
with
a
fulfilment
of
hopeless
desires
by
the
death
of
mrs
peak
brother
they
came
into
possession
of
a
freehold
house
and
about
nine
hundred
pounds
the
property
was
situated
some
twelve
miles
from
the
midland
town
of
twybridge
and
thither
they
at
once
removed

lived
mrs
peak
elder
sister
miss
cadman
but
between
this
lady
and
her
nearest
kinsfolk
there
had
been
but
slight
correspondence
the
deceased
cadman
left
her
only
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
with
capital
at
command
nicholas
peak
took
a
lease
of
certain
fields
near
his
house
and
turned
farmer
the
study
of
chemistry
had
given
a
special
bent
to
his
economic
speculations
he
fancied
himself
endowed
with
exceptional
aptitude
for
agriculture
and
the
scent
of
the
furrow
brought
all
his
energies
into
feverish
activity
activity
which
soon
impoverished
him
that
was
in
the
order
of
things
integrity
and
irascibility
wrought
the
same
results
for
the
as
for
the
ayrshire
husbandman
his
farming
came
to
a
chaotic
end
and
when
the
struggling
man
died
worn
out
at
his
wife
and
children
there
was
now
a
younger
boy
oliver
named
after
the
protector
had
no
very
bright
prospects
things
went
better
with
them
than
might
have
been
anticipated
to
mrs
peak
her
husband
death
was
not
an
occasion
of
unmingled
mourning
for
the
last
few
years
she
had
suffered
severely
from
domestic
discord
and
when
left
at
peace
by
bereavement
she
turned
with
a
sense
of
liberation
to
the
task
of
caring
for
her
children
future

just
thirteen
oliver
was
eleven
both
had
been
well
schooled

the

of
friends

might
soon
be
put
in
the
way
of
the
daughter
charlotte
sixteen
years
of
age
had
accomplishments
which
would
perhaps
be
profitable
the
widow
decided
to
make
a
home
in
twybridge
where
miss
cadman
kept
a
millinery
shop
by
means
of
this
connection
charlotte
presently
found
employment
for
her
skill
in
fine
needlework
mrs
peak
was
incapable
of
earning
money
but
the
experiences
of
her
early
married
life
enabled
her
to
make
more
than
the
most
of
the
pittance
at
her
disposal
miss
cadman
was
a
woman
of
active
mind
something
of
a
dogmatic
punctilious
in
her
claims
to
respect
proud
of
the
acknowledgment
by
her
acquaintances
that
she
was
not
as
other
tradespeople
her
chief
weakness
was
a
fanatical
ecclesiasticism
the
common
blight
of
english
womanhood
circumstances
had
allowed
her
a
better
education
than
generally
falls
to
women
of
that
standing
and
in
spite
of
her
shop
she
succeeded
in
retaining
the
friendship
of
certain
ladies
long
ago
her
schoolfellows
among
these
were
the
misses
lumb
sisters
who
lived
at
twybridge
on
a
small
independence
their
time
chiefly
devoted
to
the
support
of
the
anglican
church
an
eldest
miss
lumb
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
marry
that
growing
potentate
of
the
midlands
job
whitelaw
now
lady
whitelaw
she
dwelt
at
kingsmill
but
her
sisters
frequently
enjoyed
the
honour
of
entertaining
her
and
even
miss
cadman
the
milliner
occasionally
held
converse
with
the
baronet
wife
in
this
way
it
came
to
pass
that
the
widow
peak
and
her
children
were
brought
under
the
notice
of
persons
who
sooner
or
later
might
be
of
assistance
to
them
abounding
in
emphatic
advice
miss
cadman
easily
persuaded
her
sister
that
godwin
must
go
to
school
for
at
least
two
years
longer
the
boys
had
been
at
a
twenty
miles
away
from
their
country
home
it
would
be
better
for
them
now
to
be
put
under
the
care
of
some
twybridge
teacher
such
an
one
as
miss
cadman
acquaintances
could
recommend
for
her
own
credit
the
milliner
was
anxious
that
these
nephews
of
hers
should
not
be
running
about
the
town
as
or
the
like
and
with
prudence
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
degradation
an
uncommon
lad
like
godwin
she
imagined
him
named
after
the
historic
earl
must
not
be
robbed
of
his
fair
chance
in
life
she
would
gladly
spare
a
little
money
for
his
benefit
he
was
a
boy
to
repay
such
expenditure
indeed
it
seemed
probable
godwin
devoured
books
and
had
a
remarkable
faculty
for
gaining
solid
information
on
any
subject
that
took
his
fancy
what
might
be
the
special
bent
of
his
mind
one
could
not
yet
discover
he
read
poetry
with
precocious
gusto
but
at
the
same
time
his
aptitude
for
scientific
pursuits
was
strongly
marked
in
botany
chemistry
physics
he
made
progress
which
the
people
about
him
including
his
schoolmaster
were
incapable
of
appreciating
and
already
the
collection
of
books
left
by
his
father
most
of
them
out
of
date
failed
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
it
might
be
feared
that
tastes
so
discursive
would
be
disadvantageous
to
a
lad
who
must
needs
pursue
some
definite
and
the
strain
of
which
grew
strong
in
him
was
again
a
matter
for
concern
he
cared
nothing
for
boyish
games
and
companionship
in
the
society
of
strangers
especially
of
females
he
behaved
with
an
excessive
shyness
which
was
easily
mistaken
for
a
surly
temper
reproof
correction
he
could
not
endure
and
it
was
fortunate
that
the
decorum
of
his
habits
made
remonstrance
seldom
needful
ludicrous
as
the
project
would
have
appeared
to
any
unbiassed
observer
of
character
miss
cadman
conceived
a
hope
that
godwin
might
become
a
clergyman
from
her
point
of
view
it
was
natural
to
assume
that
uncommon
talents
must
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
church
and
she
would
have
gladly
done
her
utmost
for
the
practical
furthering
of
such
an
end
mrs
peak
though
well
aware
that
her
son
had
imbibed
the
paternal
prejudices
was
disposed
to
entertain
the
same
hope
despite
solid
obstacles
for
several
years
she
had
nourished
a
secret
antagonism
to
her
husband
spirit
of
political
social
and
religious
rebellion
and
in
her
widowhood
she
speedily
became
a
pattern
of
the
conservative
female
it
would
have
gratified
her
to
discern
any
possibility
of
godwin
assuming
the
priestly
garb
and
not
alone
on
the
ground
of
conscience
long
ago
she
had
repented
the
marriage
which
connected
her
with
such
a
family
as
that
of
the
peaks
and
she
ardently
desired
that
the
children
now
exclusively
her
own
might
enter
life
on
a
plane
superior
to
their
father
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
college
and
be
a
clergyman
she
asked
one
sunday
afternoon
when
an
hour
or
two
of
congenial
reading
seemed
to
have
put
the
boy
into
a
gentle
humour
go
to
college
was
all
very
well
diplomacy
had
prompted
this
preface
but
the
words
that
followed
fell
so
alarmingly
on
ear
that
he
looked
up
with
a
resentful
expression
unable
to
reply
otherwise
never
thought
of
it
i
suppose
his
mother
faltered
for
she
often
stood
in
awe
of
her
son
who
though
yet
but
fourteen
had
much
of
his
father
commanding
severity
do
want
to
be
a
parson
came
at
length
bluntly
use
that
word
godwin
not
it
quite
a
proper
word
it
comes
from
the
latin
the
mother
had
enough
discretion
to
keep
silence
and
godwin
after
in
vain
trying
to
settle
to
his
book
again
left
the
room
with
disturbed
countenance
he
had
now
been
attending
the
for
about
a
year
and
was
distinctly
ahead
of
his
coevals
a
christmas
examination
was
on
the
point
of
being
held
and
it
happened
that
a
singular
test
of
the
moral
character
coincided
with
the
proof
of
his
intellectual
progress
in
a
neighbouring
house
lived
an
old
man
named
rawmarsh
kindly
but
rather
eccentric
he
had
once
done
a
good
business
as
a
printer
and
now
supported
himself
by
such
chance
typographic
work
of
a
small
kind
as
friends
might
put
in
his
way
he
conceived
an
affection
for
godwin
often
had
the
boy
to
talk
with
him
of
an
evening
on
one
such
occasion
rawmarsh
opened
a
desk
took
forth
a
packet
of
newly
printed
leaves
and
with
a
mysterious
air
silently
spread
them
before
the
eyes
in
an
instant
godwin
became
aware
that
he
was
looking
at
the
examination
papers
which
a
day
or
two
hence
would
be
set
before
him
at
school
he
saw
and
recognised
a
passage
from
the
book
of
virgil
which
his
class
had
been
reading
is
you
know
whispered
the
old
printer
with
half
averted
face
godwin
shrank
away
and
could
not
resume
the
conversation
thus
interrupted
on
the
following
day
he
went
about
with
a
feeling
of
guilt
he
avoided
the
sight
of
rawmarsh
for
whom
he
had
suddenly
lost
all
respect
and
suffered
torments
in
the
thought
that
he
enjoyed
an
unfair
advantage
over
his
the
latin
passage
happened
to
be
one
which
he
knew
thoroughly
well
there
was
no
need
even
had
he
desired
to
it
up
but
in
sitting
down
to
the
examination
he
experienced
a
sense
of
shame
and
so
strong
were
the
effects
of
this
that
he
voluntarily
omitted
the
answer
to
a
certain
important
question
which
he
could
have
better
than
any
of
the
other
boys
thus
endeavouring
to
adjust
in
his
conscience
the
terms
of
competition
though
in
fact
no
such
sacrifice
was
called
for
he
came
out
at
the
head
of
the
class
but
the
triumph
had
no
savour
for
him
and
for
many
a
year
he
was
subject
to
a
flush
of
mortification
whenever
this
incident
came
back
to
his
mind
rawmarsh
was
not
the
only
intelligent
man
who
took
an
interest
in
godwin
in
a
house
which
the
boy
sometimes
visited
with
a
lodged
a
notable
couple
named
gunnery
the
husband
about
seventy
the
wife
five
years
older
they
lived
on
a
pension
from
a
railway
company
gunnery
was
a
dabbler
in
many
sciences
but
had
a
special
enthusiasm
for
geology
two
cabinets
of
stones
and
fossils
gave
evidence
of
his
zealous
travels
about
the
british
isles
he
had
even
written
a
little
of
petrology
which
was
for
sale
at
certain
booksellers
in
twybridge
and
probably
nowhere
else
to
him
about
this
time
godwin
began
to
resort
always
sure
of
a
welcome
and
in
the
little
uncarpeted
room
where
gunnery
pursued
his
investigations
many
a
fateful
lesson
was
given
and
received
the
teacher
understood
the
intelligence
he
had
to
deal
with
and
was
delighted
to
convey
by
the
mode
of
suggested
inference
sundry
results
of
knowledge
which
it
perhaps
would
not
have
been
prudent
to
declare
in
plain
popular
words
their
intercourse
was
not
invariably
placid
the
geologist
had
an
irritable
temper
and
in
certain
states
of
the
atmosphere
his
rheumatic
twinges
made
it
advisable
to
shun
argument
with
him
godwin
moreover
was
distinguished
by
an
instability
of
mood
peculiarly
trying
to
an
old
man
testy
humour
of
a
sudden
to
mr
gunnery
surprise
and
annoyance
he
would
lose
all
interest
in
this
or
that
science
thus
one
day
the
lad
declared
himself
unable
to
name
two
stones
set
before
him
felspar
and
quartz
and
when
his
instructor
broke
into
angry
impatience
he
turned
sullenly
away
exclaiming
that
he
was
tired
of
geology
of
geology
cried
gunnery
with
flaming
eyes
am
tired
of
master
peak
be
off
and
do
come
again
till
i
send
for
you
godwin
retired
without
a
word
on
the
second
day
he
was
summoned
back
again
but
his
resentment
of
the
dismissal
rankled
in
him
for
a
long
time
injury
to
his
pride
was
the
wrong
he
found
it
hardest
to
forgive
his
schoolmaster
aware
of
the
unusual
pursuits
which
he
added
to
the
routine
of
lessons
gave
him
as
a
prize
the
english
translation
of
a
book
by
figuier
world
before
the
strongly
interested
by
the
illustrations
of
the
volume
fanciful
scenes
from
the
successive
geologic
periods
godwin
at
once
carried
it
to
his
scientific
friend
growled
gunnery
deluge
deluge
but
he
restrained
himself
handed
the
book
coldly
back
and
began
to
talk
of
something
else
all
this
was
highly
significant
to
godwin
who
of
course
began
the
perusal
of
his
prize
in
a
suspicious
mood
nor
was
he
long
before
he
sympathised
with
mr
gunnery
distaste
though
too
young
to
grasp
the
arguments
at
issue
his
prejudices
were
strongly
excited
by
the
conventional
theism
which
pervades
figuier
work
already
it
was
the
habit
of
his
mind
to
associate
popular
dogma
with
intellectual
shallowness
herein
as
at
every
other
point
which
fell
within
his
scope
he
had
begun
to
scorn
average
people
and
to
pride
himself
intensely
on
views
which
he
found
generally
condemned
day
by
day
he
grew
into
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
memories
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
father
he
began
to
interpret
remarks
details
of
behaviour
instances
of
wrath
which
though
they
had
stamped
themselves
on
his
recollection
conveyed
at
the
time
no
precise
significance
the
issue
was
that
he
hardened
himself
against
the
influence
of
his
mother
and
his
aunt
regarding
them
as
in
league
against
the
free
progress
of
his
education
as
women
again
he
despised
these
relatives
it
is
almost
impossible
for
a
lad
born
in
the
lower
middle
class
to
escape
this
stage
of
development
the
brutally
healthy
boy
contemns
the
female
sex
because
he
sees
it
incapable
of
his
own
athletic
sports
but
godwin
was
one
of
those
upon
whose
awaking
intellect
is
forced
a
perception
of
the
so
general
in
women
when
they
are
taught
few
of
graces
and
none
of
its
serious
concerns
their
paltry
prepossessions
their
vulgar
sequaciousness
their
invincible
ignorance
their
absorption
in
a
petty
self
and
especially
is
this
phase
of
thought
to
be
expected
in
a
boy
whose
heart
blindly
nourishes
the
seeds
of
poetical
passion
it
was
godwin
sincere
belief
that
he
held
girls
as
girls
in
abhorrence
this
meant
that
he
dreaded
their
personal
criticism
and
that
the
spectacle
of
female
beauty
sometimes
overcame
him
with
a
despair
which
he
could
not
analyse
matrons
and
elderly
unmarried
women
were
truly
the
objects
of
his
disdain
in
them
he
saw
nothing
but
their
shortcomings
towards
his
mother
he
was
conscious
of
no
tenderness
of
as
little
towards
his
sister
who
often
censured
him
with
trenchant
tongue
as
for
his
aunt
whose
admiration
of
him
was
modified
by
reticences
he
could
never
be
at
ease
in
her
company
so
strong
a
dislike
had
he
for
her
look
her
voice
her
ways
of
speech
he
would
soon
be
fifteen
years
old
mrs
peak
was
growing
anxious
for
she
could
no
longer
consent
to
draw
upon
her
sister
for
a
portion
of
the
school
fees
and
no
pertinent
suggestion
for
the
lad
future
was
made
by
any
of
the
people
who
admired
his
cleverness
miss
cadman
still
clung
in
a
fitful
way
to
the
idea
of
making
her
nephew
a
cleric
she
had
often
talked
it
over
with
the
misses
lumb
who
of
course
held
that
sacrifice
was
justifiable
with
such
a
motive
and
who
suggested
a
hope
that
by
the
instrumentality
of
lady
whitelaw
a
curacy
might
easily
be
obtained
as
soon
as
godwin
was
old
enough
but
several
years
must
pass
before
that
levitical
stage
could
be
reached
and
then
after
all
perhaps
the
younger
boy
oliver
placid
of
temper
and
notably
pliant
in
mind
was
better
suited
for
the
dignity
of
orders
it
was
lamentable
that
godwin
should
have
become
so
intimate
with
that
gunnery
who
certainly
never
attended
either
church
or
chapel
and
who
seemed
to
have
imbued
his
pupil
with
immoral
theories
concerning
the
date
of
creation
godwin
held
more
decidedly
aloof
from
his
aunt
and
had
been
heard
by
charlotte
to
speak
very
disrespectfully
of
the
misses
lumb
in
short
there
was
no
choice
but
to
discover
an
opening
for
him
in
some
secular
pursuit
could
he
perhaps
become
an
assistant
teacher
or
must
he
into
an
office
no
common
lad
a
youth
whose
brain
glowed
like
a
furnace
whose
heart
throbbed
with
tumult
of
high
ambitions
of
inchoate
desires
endowed
with
knowledge
altogether
exceptional
for
his
years
a
nature
essentially
militant
displaying
itself
in
innumerable
forms
of
callow
intolerance
apt
assuredly
for
some
vigorous
part
in
life
but
as
likely
as
not
to
rush
headlong
on
traverse
roads
if
no
judicious
mind
assumed
control
of
him
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
boy
all
very
well
if
the
question
signified
in
what
way
to
provide
for
the
healthy
development
of
his
manhood
of
course
it
meant
nothing
of
the
sort
but
merely
what
work
can
be
found
for
him
whereby
he
may
earn
his
daily
bread
we
his
kinsfolk
even
not
to
think
of
the
world
at
large
can
have
no
concern
with
his
growth
as
an
intellectual
being
we
are
hard
pressed
to
supply
our
own
mouths
with
food
and
now
that
we
have
done
our
recognised
duty
by
him
it
is
high
time
that
he
learnt
to
fight
for
his
own
share
of
provender
happily
he
is
of
the
robust
sex
he
can
hit
out
right
and
left
and
make
we
have
armed
him
with
serviceable
weapons
and
now
he
must
use
them
against
the
enemy
that
is
to
say
against
all
mankind
who
will
quickly
enough
deprive
him
of
sustenance
if
he
fail
in
the
conflict
we
neither
know
nor
in
great
measure
care
for
what
employment
he
is
naturally
marked
obviously
he
can
not
heave
coals
or
sell
dogs
meat
but
with
negative
certainty
not
much
else
can
be
resolved
seeing
how
desperate
is
the
competition
for
minimum
salaries
he
has
been
born
and
he
must
eat
by
what
licensed
channel
may
he
procure
the
necessary
viands
paternal
relatives
godwin
had
as
good
as
none
in
quitting
london
nicholas
peak
had
ceased
to
hold
communication
with
any
of
his
own
stock
save
the
younger
brother
andrew
with
him
he
occasionally
exchanged
a
letter
but
andrew
share
in
the
correspondence
was
limited
to
ungrammatical
and
often
unintelligible
hints
of
numerous
projects
for
just
after
the
removal
of
the
bereaved
family
to
twybridge
they
were
surprised
by
a
visit
from
andrew
in
answer
to
one
of
whose
letters
mrs
peak
had
sent
news
of
her
death
though
her
dislike
of
the
man
amounted
to
loathing
the
widow
could
not
refuse
him
hospitality
she
did
her
best
however
to
prevent
his
coming
in
contact
with
anyone
she
knew
andrew
declared
that
he
was
at
length
prospering
he
had
started
a
at
dalston
in
london
and
positively
urged
a
proposal
beyond
doubt
that
godwin
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
him
and
learn
the
business
since
then
the
londoner
had
once
again
visited
twybridge
towards
the
end
of
godwin
last
this
time
he
spoke
of
himself
less
hopefully
and
declared
a
wish
to
transfer
his
business
to
some
provincial
town
where
he
thought
his
metropolitan
experience
might
be
of
great
value
in
the
absence
of
serious
competition
it
was
not
difficult
to
discover
a
family
likeness
between
instability
and
the
idealism
which
had
proved
the
ruin
of
nicholas
on
this
second
occasion
godwin
tried
to
escape
a
meeting
with
his
uncle
unable
to
do
so
he
sat
mute
replying
to
questions
monosyllabically
mrs
peak
shame
and
annoyance
in
face
of
this
vulgarian
were
but
feeble
emotions
compared
with
those
of
her
son
godwin
hated
the
man
and
was
in
dread
lest
any
should
come
to
know
of
such
a
connection
yet
delicacy
prevented
his
uttering
a
word
on
the
subject
to
his
mother
mrs
silence
after
andrew
departure
made
it
uncertain
how
she
regarded
the
obligation
of
kindred
and
in
any
such
matter
as
this
the
boy
was
far
too
sensitive
to
risk
giving
pain
but
to
his
brother
oliver
he
spoke
is
the
brute
to
us
when
i
a
man
let
him
venture
to
come
near
me
and
see
what
sort
of
a
reception
he
get
i
hate
low
uneducated
people
i
hate
them
worse
than
the
filthiest
vermin
do
you
oliver
aged
but
thirteen
assented
as
he
habitually
did
to
any
question
which
seemed
to
await
an
affirmative
ought
to
be
swept
off
the
face
of
the
earth
pursued
godwin
sitting
up
in
bed
for
the
dialogue
took
place
about
eleven
at
night
the
creatures
who
ca
speak
proper
english
and
do
know
how
to
behave
themselves
i
transport
them
to
the
falkland
islands
this
geographic
precision
was
a
note
of
the
mind
let
them
die
off
as
soon
as
possible
the
children
should
be
sent
to
school
and
purified
if
possible
if
not
they
too
should
be
got
rid
of
an
aristocrat
godwin
remarked
oliver
simply
for
the
elder
brother
had
of
late
been
telling
him
fearful
stories
from
the
french
revolution
with
something
of
an
bias
hope
i
am
i
mean
to
be
that
certain
there
nothing
i
hate
like
vulgarity
that
why
i
ca
stand
roper
when
he
beat
me
in
mathematics
last
midsummer
i
felt
so
ashamed
i
could
hardly
bear
myself
i
working
like
a
nigger
at
algebra
and
euclid
this
half
just
because
i
think
it
would
almost
kill
me
to
be
beaten
again
by
a
low
cad
this
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
godwin
found
expression
for
the
prejudice
which
affected
all
his
thoughts
and
feelings
it
relieved
him
to
have
spoken
thus
henceforth
he
had
become
clear
as
to
his
point
of
view
by
dubbing
him
aristocrat
oliver
had
flattered
him
in
the
subtlest
way
if
indeed
the
title
were
justly
his
as
he
instantly
felt
it
was
the
inference
was
plain
that
he
must
be
an
aristocrat
of
nature
own
making
one
of
the
few
highly
favoured
beings
who
in
despite
of
circumstance
are
pinnacled
above
mankind
in
his
ignorance
of
life
the
boy
visioned
a
triumphant
career
an
aristocrat
might
possibly
become
one
even
in
the
common
sense
did
he
but
pursue
that
end
with
sufficient
zeal
and
in
his
power
of
persistent
endeavour
he
had
no
lack
of
faith
the
next
day
he
walked
with
exalted
head
encountering
the
objectionable
roper
he
smiled
upon
him
contemptuously
tolerant
there
being
no
hope
of
effective
assistance
from
relatives
mrs
peak
turned
for
counsel
to
a
man
of
business
with
whom
her
husband
had
made
acquaintance
in
his
farming
days
and
who
held
a
position
of
influence
at
twybridge
this
was
moxey
manufacturing
chemist
famous
in
the
midlands
for
his
and
cattle
dressings
and
sundry
other
products
of
agricultural
enterprise
his
but
lucrative
works
were
situated
a
mile
out
of
the
town
and
within
sight
of
the
reeking
chimneys
stood
a
large
plain
house
uncomfortably
like
an
of
some
kind
in
which
he
dwelt
with
his
five
daughters
thither
one
evening
mrs
peak
betook
herself
having
learnt
that
moxey
dined
at
five
and
that
he
was
generally
to
be
found
digging
in
his
garden
until
sunset
her
reception
was
civil
the
manufacturer
sparing
of
words
but
with
no
unkindly
face
requested
that
godwin
should
be
sent
to
see
him
and
promised
to
do
his
best
to
be
of
use
a
talk
with
the
boy
strengthened
his
interest
he
was
surprised
at
godwin
knowledge
of
chemistry
pleased
with
his
general
intelligence
and
in
the
end
offered
to
make
a
place
for
him
at
the
works
where
though
for
a
year
or
two
his
earnings
must
be
small
he
would
gain
experience
likely
to
be
of
substantial
use
to
him
godwin
did
not
find
the
proposal
distasteful
it
brought
a
change
into
his
life
and
the
excitement
of
novelty
it
flattered
him
with
the
show
of
release
from
pupilage
to
moxey
he
went
the
hours
were
not
long
and
it
was
understood
that
his
theoretical
studies
should
continue
in
the
evening
godwin
home
was
a
very
small
house
in
a
monotonous
little
street
a
garret
served
as
bedroom
for
the
two
boys
also
as
the
elder
one
laboratory
servant
mrs
peak
had
none
she
managed
everything
herself
as
in
the
old
greenwich
days
leaving
charlotte
free
to
work
at
her
embroidery
godwin
took
turns
with
oliver
at
blacking
the
shoes
as
a
matter
of
course
the
boys
accompanied
their
mother
each
sunday
morning
to
the
parish
church
and
this
ceremony
was
becoming
an
insufferable
tax
on
godwin
patience
it
was
not
only
that
he
hated
the
name
of
religion
and
scorned
with
much
fierceness
all
who
came
in
sympathetic
contact
therewith
the
loss
of
time
seemed
to
him
an
oppressive
injury
especially
now
that
he
began
to
suffer
from
restricted
leisure
he
would
not
refuse
to
obey
his
mother
wish
but
the
sullenness
of
his
sabbatic
demeanour
made
the
whole
family
uncomfortable
as
often
as
possible
he
feigned
illness
he
tried
the
effect
of
dolorous
sighs
and
groans
but
mrs
peak
could
not
dream
of
conceding
a
point
which
would
have
seemed
to
her
the
condonation
of
deadly
sin
i
am
a
man
muttered
godwin
when
i
am
a
man
a
year
had
gone
by
and
the
routine
to
which
he
was
bound
began
to
have
a
servile
flavour
his
mind
chafed
at
subjugation
to
commercial
interests
sick
of
and
cattle
dressings
he
grew
tired
of
chemistry
altogether
and
presently
of
physical
science
in
general
his
evenings
were
given
to
poetry
and
history
he
took
up
the
classical
schoolbooks
again
and
found
a
charm
in
latin
syntax
hitherto
unperceived
it
was
plain
to
him
now
how
he
had
been
wronged
by
the
necessity
of
leaving
school
when
his
education
had
but
just
begun
discontent
becoming
ripe
for
utterance
he
unbosomed
himself
to
mr
gunnery
it
happened
that
the
old
man
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
kingsmill
where
he
had
spent
a
week
in
the
museum
then
newly
enriched
with
geologic
specimens
after
listening
in
silence
to
the
complaints
and
pondering
for
a
long
time
he
began
to
talk
of
whitelaw
college
it
cost
much
to
study
there
godwin
asked
gloomily
great
sum
i
think
there
are
scholarships
to
be
had
gunnery
threw
out
the
suggestion
carelessly
knowing
the
hazards
of
life
he
could
not
quite
justify
himself
in
encouraging
restiveness
for
free
study
but
that
would
mean
free
living
you
know
students
do
live
at
the
college
do
you
go
in
for
a
scholarship
the
old
man
replied
meditatively
you
were
to
pass
the
cambridge
local
examination
and
to
get
the
first
place
in
the
kingsmill
district
you
would
have
three
years
of
free
study
at
whitelaw
years
shouted
godwin
springing
up
from
his
chair
how
could
you
live
my
boy
godwin
sat
down
again
and
let
his
head
fall
forward
how
to
keep
oneself
alive
during
a
few
years
of
intellectual
growth
a
question
often
asked
by
men
of
mature
age
but
seldom
by
a
lad
of
sixteen
no
matter
he
resolved
that
he
would
study
for
this
cambridge
local
examination
and
have
a
try
for
the
scholarship
his
attainments
were
already
up
to
the
standard
required
for
average
success
in
such
competitions
on
obtaining
a
set
of
he
found
that
they
looked
easy
enough
could
he
not
come
out
first
in
the
kingsmill
district
he
worked
vigorously
at
special
subjects
aid
was
needless
but
he
wished
for
more
leisure
not
a
word
to
any
member
of
his
household
when
his
mother
discovered
that
he
was
reading
in
the
bedroom
till
long
past
midnight
she
made
serious
objection
on
the
score
of
health
and
on
that
of
gas
bills
godwin
quietly
asserted
that
work
he
must
and
that
if
necessary
he
would
buy
candles
out
of
his
he
had
unexpectedly
become
more
grave
more
restrained
he
even
ceased
to
grumble
about
going
to
church
having
found
that
service
time
could
be
utilised
for
committing
to
memory
lists
of
dates
and
the
like
jotted
down
on
a
slip
of
paper
when
the
time
for
the
examination
drew
near
he
at
length
told
his
mother
to
what
end
he
had
been
labouring
and
asked
her
to
grant
him
the
assistance
necessary
for
his
journey
and
the
sojourn
at
kingsmill
the
small
sum
he
had
been
able
to
save
after
purchase
of
books
would
not
suffice
mrs
peak
knew
not
whether
to
approve
her
son
ambition
or
to
try
to
repress
it
she
would
welcome
an
improval
in
his
prospects
but
granting
success
how
was
he
to
live
whilst
profiting
by
a
scholarship
and
again
what
did
he
propose
to
make
of
himself
when
he
had
spent
three
years
in
study
any
case
was
godwin
reply
should
be
sure
of
a
good
place
as
a
teacher
but
i
think
i
might
try
for
something
in
the
civil
service
there
are
all
sorts
of
positions
to
be
got
it
was
idle
to
discuss
the
future
whilst
the
first
step
was
still
speculative
mrs
peak
consented
to
favour
the
attempt
and
what
was
more
to
keep
it
a
secret
until
the
issue
should
be
known
it
was
needful
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
from
moxey
and
godwin
when
making
the
request
stated
for
what
purpose
he
was
going
to
kingsmill
though
without
explaining
the
hope
which
had
encouraged
his
studies
the
project
seemed
laudable
and
his
employer
made
no
difficulties
godwin
just
missed
the
scholarship
of
candidates
in
the
prescribed
district
he
came
out
second
grievous
was
the
disappointment
to
come
so
near
success
exasperated
his
impatient
temper
and
for
a
few
days
his
bondage
at
the
chemical
works
seemed
intolerable
he
was
ready
for
almost
any
venture
that
promised
release
and
new
scope
for
his
fretting
energies
but
at
the
moment
when
nervous
irritation
was
most
acute
a
remarkable
act
of
kindness
suddenly
restored
to
him
all
the
hopes
he
had
abandoned
one
saturday
afternoon
he
was
summoned
from
his
surly
retreat
in
the
garret
to
speak
with
a
visitor
on
entering
the
he
found
his
mother
in
company
with
miss
cadman
and
the
misses
lumb
and
from
the
ladies
who
spoke
with
amiable
alternation
he
learnt
that
they
were
commissioned
by
sir
job
whitelaw
to
offer
for
his
acceptance
a
studentship
at
whitelaw
college
affected
by
her
son
chagrin
mrs
peak
had
disclosed
the
story
to
her
sister
who
had
repeated
it
to
the
misses
lumb
who
in
turn
had
made
it
the
subject
of
a
letter
to
lady
whitelaw
it
was
an
annual
practice
with
sir
job
to
discover
some
promising
lad
whom
he
could
benefit
by
the
payment
of
his
fees
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
of
college
study
the
hint
from
twybridge
came
to
him
just
at
the
suitable
time
and
on
further
inquiry
he
decided
to
make
proffer
of
this
advantage
to
godwin
peak
the
only
condition
was
that
arrangements
should
be
made
by
the
student
relatives
for
his
support
during
the
proposed
period
this
generosity
took
away
godwin
breath
the
expenditure
it
represented
was
trifling
but
from
a
stranger
in
sir
job
position
it
had
something
which
recalled
to
so
fervent
a
mind
the
poetry
of
medicean
patronage
for
the
moment
no
faintest
doubt
gave
warning
to
his
he
was
eager
to
accept
nobly
a
benefaction
nobly
intended
miss
cadman
flattered
by
sir
job
attention
to
her
nephew
now
came
forward
with
an
offer
to
contribute
towards
godwin
livelihood
her
supplement
would
eke
into
adequacy
such
slender
allowance
as
the
widow
purse
could
afford
details
were
privately
discussed
resolves
were
taken
moxey
when
it
was
made
known
to
him
without
explanation
that
godwin
was
to
be
sent
to
whitelaw
college
behaved
with
kindness
he
at
once
released
the
lad
and
added
a
present
to
the
salary
that
was
due
proper
acknowledgment
of
the
baronet
kindness
was
made
by
the
beneficiary
himself
who
wrote
a
letter
giving
truer
testimony
of
his
mental
calibre
than
would
have
been
offered
had
he
expressed
himself
by
word
of
mouth
a
genial
reply
summoned
him
to
an
interview
as
soon
as
he
should
have
found
an
abode
in
kingsmill
the
lodging
he
had
occupied
during
the
examination
was
permanently
secured
and
a
new
period
of
godwin
life
began
for
two
years
that
is
to
say
until
his
age
drew
towards
nineteen
peak
pursued
the
arts
curriculum
at
whitelaw
his
mood
on
entering
decided
his
choice
which
was
left
free
to
him
experience
of
utilitarian
chemistry
had
for
the
present
made
his
liberal
tastes
predominant
and
neither
the
splendid
laboratories
of
whitelaw
nor
the
repute
of
its
scientific
professors
tempted
him
to
what
had
once
seemed
his
natural
direction
in
the
second
year
however
he
enlarged
his
course
by
the
addition
of
one
or
two
classes
not
included
in
sir
job
design
these
were
paid
for
out
of
a
present
made
to
him
by
gunnery
it
being
customary
for
the
regular
students
of
whitelaw
to
graduate
at
london
university
peak
passed
his
matriculation
and
worked
on
for
the
preliminary
test
then
known
as
first
in
the
meanwhile
he
rose
steadily
achieving
distinction
in
the
college
the
more
observant
of
his
teachers
remarked
him
even
where
he
fell
short
of
academic
triumph
and
among
his
he
had
the
name
of
a
stern
one
not
easily
beaten
where
he
had
set
his
mind
on
excelling
he
was
not
generally
liked
for
his
mood
appeared
unsocial
and
a
repelling
arrogance
was
sometimes
felt
in
his
talk
no
doubt
said
the
more
fortunate
young
men
he
came
from
a
very
poor
home
and
suffered
from
the
narrowness
of
his
means
they
noticed
that
he
did
not
subscribe
to
the
college
union
and
that
he
could
never
join
in
talk
regarding
the
diversions
of
the
town
his
two
or
three
intimates
were
chosen
from
among
those
contemporaries
who
read
hard
and
dressed
poorly
the
details
of
godwin
private
life
were
noteworthy
accustomed
hitherto
to
a
domestic
circle
at
kingsmill
he
found
himself
isolated
and
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
surrender
all
at
once
the
comforts
of
home
for
a
time
he
felt
as
though
his
ambition
were
a
delinquency
which
entailed
the
punishment
of
loneliness
nor
did
his
relations
with
sir
job
whitelaw
tend
to
mitigate
this
feeling
in
his
first
interview
with
the
baronet
godwin
showed
to
little
advantage
a
deadly
bashfulness
forbade
him
to
be
natural
either
in
attitude
or
speech
he
felt
his
dependence
in
a
way
he
had
not
foreseen
the
very
clothes
he
wore
then
fresh
from
the
tailor
seemed
to
be
the
gift
of
charity
and
their
stiffness
shamed
him
a
man
of
the
world
sir
job
could
make
allowance
for
these
defects
he
understood
that
the
truest
kindness
would
be
to
leave
a
youth
such
as
this
to
the
forming
influences
of
the
college
so
godwin
barely
had
a
glimpse
of
lady
whitelaw
in
her
husband
study
and
thereafter
for
many
months
he
saw
nothing
of
his
benefactors
subsequently
he
was
twice
invited
to
interviews
with
sir
job
who
talked
with
kindness
and
commendation
then
came
the
death
godwin
received
an
assurance
that
this
event
would
be
no
check
upon
his
career
but
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
directly
from
lady
whitelaw
not
a
house
in
kingsmill
opened
hospitable
doors
to
the
lonely
student
nor
was
anyone
to
blame
for
this
with
no
family
had
he
friendly
acquaintance
when
towards
the
end
of
his
second
year
he
grew
sufficiently
intimate
with
buckland
warricombe
to
walk
out
with
him
to
thornhaw
it
could
be
nothing
more
than
a
scarcely
welcome
exception
to
the
rule
of
solitude
impossible
for
him
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
such
people
as
the
warricombes
with
their
large
and
joyous
scheme
of
life
only
at
a
hearth
where
homeliness
and
cordiality
united
to
unthaw
his
proud
reserve
could
godwin
perchance
have
found
the
companionship
he
needed
many
such
homes
existed
in
kingsmill
but
no
kindly
fortune
led
the
young
man
within
the
sphere
of
their
warmth
his
lodgings
were
in
a
very
ugly
street
in
the
ugliest
outskirts
of
the
town
he
had
to
take
a
long
walk
through
desolate
districts
sordid
pasture
degenerate
village
before
he
could
refresh
his
eyes
with
the
rural
scenery
which
was
so
great
a
joy
to
him
as
almost
to
be
a
necessity
the
immediate
vicinage
offered
nothing
but
monotone
of
grimy
lower
dwellings
occasionally
relieved
by
a
he
occupied
two
rooms
not
unreasonably
clean
and
was
seldom
disturbed
by
the
attentions
of
his
landlady
an
impartial
observer
might
have
wondered
at
the
negligence
which
left
him
to
arrange
his
life
as
best
he
could
notwithstanding
youth
and
utter
inexperience
it
looked
indeed
as
if
there
were
no
one
in
the
world
who
cared
what
became
of
him
yet
this
was
merely
the
result
of
his
mother
circumstances
and
of
his
own
character
mrs
peak
could
do
no
more
than
make
her
small
remittances
and
therewith
send
an
occasional
admonition
regarding
his
health
she
did
not
in
fact
conceive
the
state
of
things
imagining
that
the
authority
and
supervisal
of
the
college
extended
over
her
son
daily
existence
whereas
it
was
possible
for
godwin
to
frequent
lectures
or
not
to
study
or
to
waste
his
time
pretty
much
as
he
chose
subject
only
to
official
inquiry
if
his
attendance
became
frequently
irregular
his
independent
temper
and
the
seeming
maturity
of
his
mind
supplied
another
excuse
for
the
imprudent
confidence
which
left
him
to
his
own
resources
yet
the
perils
of
the
situation
were
great
indeed
a
youth
of
less
concentrated
purpose
more
at
the
mercy
of
casual
allurement
would
probably
have
gone
to
wreck
amid
trials
so
exceptional
trials
not
only
of
his
moral
nature
the
sums
of
money
with
which
he
was
furnished
fell
short
of
a
reasonable
total
for
bare
necessities
in
the
calculation
made
by
mrs
peak
and
her
sister
outlay
on
books
had
practically
been
lost
sight
of
it
was
presumed
that
ten
shillings
a
term
would
cover
this
item
but
godwin
could
not
consent
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
in
his
armoury
for
academic
contest
the
first
month
saw
him
compelled
to
contract
his
diet
that
he
might
purchase
books
thenceforth
he
rarely
had
enough
to
eat
his
landlady
supplied
him
with
breakfast
tea
and
supper
each
repast
of
the
very
simplest
kind
for
dinner
it
was
understood
that
he
repaired
to
some
public
table
where
meat
and
vegetables
with
perchance
a
supplementary
sweet
when
nature
demanded
it
might
be
had
for
about
a
shilling
that
shilling
was
not
often
at
his
disposal
dinner
as
it
is
understood
by
the
comfortably
clad
the
meal
which
is
a
part
of
english
respectability
came
to
be
represented
by
a
small
or
even
a
couple
of
buns
eaten
at
the
little
shop
over
against
the
college
after
a
long
morning
of
mental
application
this
was
poor
refreshment
the
long
afternoon
which
followed
again
spent
in
rigorous
study
could
not
but
reduce
a
growing
frame
to
ravenous
hunger
tea
and
buttered
bread
were
the
means
of
appeasing
it
until
another
four
hours
work
called
for
reward
in
the
shape
of
bread
and
cheese
even
yet
the
day
toil
was
not
ended
godwin
sometimes
read
long
after
midnight
with
the
result
that
when
at
length
he
tried
to
sleep
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
kept
him
for
a
long
time
feverishly
wakeful
these
hardships
he
concealed
from
the
people
at
twybridge
complaint
it
seemed
to
him
would
be
ungrateful
for
sacrifices
were
already
made
on
his
behalf
his
father
as
he
well
remembered
was
wont
to
relate
with
a
kind
of
angry
satisfaction
the
miseries
through
which
he
had
fought
his
way
to
education
and
the
old
enough
now
to
reflect
with
compassionate
understanding
upon
that
life
of
conflict
godwin
resolved
that
he
too
would
bear
the
burdens
inseparable
from
poverty
and
in
some
moods
was
even
glad
to
suffer
as
his
father
had
done
fortunately
he
had
a
sound
basis
of
health
and
hunger
and
vigils
would
not
easily
affect
his
constitution
if
thus
hampered
he
could
outstrip
competitors
who
had
every
advantage
of
circumstance
the
more
glorious
his
triumph
sunday
was
an
interval
of
leisure
rejoicing
in
deliverance
from
sabbatarianism
he
generally
spent
the
morning
in
a
long
walk
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
devoted
to
reading
he
had
subscribed
to
a
circulating
library
and
thus
obtained
new
publications
recommended
to
him
in
the
literary
paper
which
again
taxed
his
stomach
mere
did
not
satisfy
him
he
was
possessed
with
throes
of
spiritual
desire
impelling
him
towards
that
world
of
unfettered
speculation
which
he
had
long
indistinctly
imagined
it
was
a
great
thing
to
learn
what
the
past
could
teach
to
set
himself
on
the
common
level
of
intellectual
men
but
he
understood
that
college
learning
could
not
be
an
end
in
itself
that
the
professors
to
whom
he
listened
either
did
not
speak
out
all
that
was
in
their
minds
or
if
they
did
were
far
from
representing
the
advanced
guard
of
modern
thought
with
eagerness
he
at
length
betook
himself
to
the
teachers
of
philosophy
and
of
geology
having
paid
for
these
lectures
out
of
his
own
pocket
he
felt
as
if
he
had
won
a
privilege
beyond
the
conventional
course
of
study
an
initiation
to
a
higher
sphere
of
intellect
the
result
was
disillusion
not
even
in
these
could
he
hear
the
word
for
which
he
waited
the
bold
annunciation
of
newly
discovered
law
the
science
which
had
completely
broken
with
tradition
he
came
away
unsatisfied
and
brooded
upon
the
possibilities
which
would
open
for
him
when
he
was
no
longer
dependent
his
evening
work
at
home
was
subject
to
a
disturbance
which
would
have
led
him
to
seek
other
lodgings
could
he
have
hoped
to
find
any
so
cheap
as
these
the
landlady
son
a
lank
youth
of
the
clerk
species
was
wont
to
amuse
himself
from
eight
to
ten
with
practice
on
a
piano
by
dint
of
perseverance
he
had
learned
to
strum
two
or
three
hymnal
melodies
popularised
by
american
evangelists
occasionally
he
even
added
the
charm
of
his
voice
which
had
a
pietistic
nasality
not
easily
endured
by
an
ear
of
any
refinement
not
only
was
godwin
harassed
by
the
recurrence
of
these
performances
the
tunes
worked
themselves
into
his
brain
and
sometimes
throughout
a
whole
day
their
burden
clanged
and
squalled
incessantly
on
his
mental
hearing
he
longed
to
entreat
forbearance
from
the
musician
but
an
excess
of
delicacy
which
always
ruled
his
behaviour
kept
him
silent
certain
passages
in
the
classics
and
many
an
elaborate
mathematical
formula
long
retained
for
him
an
association
with
the
cadences
of
revivalist
hymnody
like
all
proud
natures
condemned
to
solitude
he
tried
to
convince
himself
that
he
had
no
need
of
society
that
he
despised
its
attractions
and
could
be
so
far
was
this
from
the
truth
that
he
often
regarded
with
bitter
envy
those
of
his
who
had
the
social
air
who
conversed
freely
among
their
equals
and
showed
that
the
pursuits
of
the
college
were
only
a
part
of
their
existence
these
young
men
were
either
preparing
for
the
university
or
would
pass
from
whitelaw
to
business
profession
official
training
in
any
case
a
track
was
marked
out
for
them
by
the
zealous
care
of
relatives
and
friends
and
their
efforts
would
always
be
aided
applauded
by
a
kindly
circle
some
of
them
godwin
could
not
but
admire
so
healthful
were
they
so
bright
of
intellect
and
courteous
in
manner
a
type
distinct
from
any
he
had
formerly
observed
others
were
antipathetic
to
him
their
aggressive
gentility
conflicted
with
the
wariness
of
his
such
a
one
for
instance
as
bruno
chilvers
the
sound
of
whose
mincing
voice
as
he
read
in
the
class
so
irritated
him
that
at
times
he
had
to
cover
his
ears
yet
did
it
chance
that
one
of
these
offensive
youths
addressed
a
civil
word
to
him
on
the
instant
his
prejudice
was
disarmed
and
his
emotions
flowed
forth
in
a
response
to
which
he
would
gladly
have
given
free
expression
when
he
was
invited
to
meet
the
relatives
of
buckland
warricombe
shyness
prepossessed
him
against
them
but
the
frank
kindness
of
his
reception
moved
him
and
on
going
away
he
was
ashamed
to
have
replied
so
boorishly
to
attentions
so
amiably
meant
the
same
note
of
character
sounded
in
what
personal
intercourse
he
had
with
the
professors
though
his
spirit
of
criticism
was
at
times
busy
with
these
gentlemen
he
had
for
most
of
them
a
profound
regard
and
to
be
elected
by
one
or
other
for
a
word
of
commendation
a
little
private
assistance
a
inquiry
as
to
his
progress
always
made
his
heart
beat
high
with
gratitude
they
were
his
first
exemplars
of
finished
courtesy
of
delicate
culture
and
he
could
never
sufficiently
regret
that
no
one
of
them
was
aware
how
thankfully
he
recognised
his
debt
in
longing
for
the
intimacy
of
refined
people
he
began
to
modify
his
sentiments
with
regard
to
the
female
sex
his
first
at
whitelaw
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
sat
in
an
assembly
where
ladies
as
he
understood
the
title
could
be
seen
and
heard
the
impression
he
received
was
deep
and
lasting
on
the
seat
behind
him
were
two
girls
whose
intermittent
talk
held
him
with
irresistible
charm
throughout
the
whole
ceremony
he
had
not
imagined
that
girls
could
display
such
intelligence
and
the
sweet
clearness
of
their
intonation
the
purity
of
their
accent
the
grace
of
their
habitual
phrases
were
things
altogether
beyond
his
experience
this
was
not
the
english
he
had
been
wont
to
hear
on
female
lips
his
mother
and
his
aunt
spoke
with
propriety
their
associates
were
but
here
was
something
quite
different
from
inoffensiveness
of
tone
and
diction
godwin
appreciated
the
differentiating
cause
these
young
ladies
behind
him
had
been
trained
from
the
cradle
to
speak
for
the
delight
of
fastidious
ears
that
they
should
be
grammatical
was
not
enough
they
must
excel
in
the
art
of
conversational
music
of
course
there
existed
a
world
where
only
such
speech
was
interchanged
and
how
inestimably
happy
those
men
to
whom
the
sphere
was
native
when
the
proceedings
were
over
he
drew
aside
and
watched
the
two
girls
as
they
mingled
with
acquaintances
he
kept
them
in
view
until
they
left
the
college
an
emotion
such
as
this
he
had
never
known
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
humiliated
without
embitterment
the
bitterness
came
when
he
had
returned
to
his
home
in
the
back
street
of
twybridge
and
was
endeavouring
to
spend
the
holidays
in
a
hard
he
loathed
the
penurious
simplicity
to
which
his
life
was
condemned
all
familiar
circumstances
were
become
petty
coarse
vulgar
in
his
eyes
the
contrast
with
the
idealised
world
of
his
ambition
plunged
him
into
despair
even
gunnery
seemed
an
ignoble
figure
when
compared
with
the
professors
of
whitelaw
and
his
authority
in
the
sciences
was
now
subjected
to
doubt
however
much
or
little
might
result
from
the
three
years
at
college
it
was
clear
to
godwin
that
his
former
existence
had
passed
into
infinite
remoteness
he
was
no
longer
fit
for
twybridge
no
longer
a
companion
for
his
kindred
oliver
whose
dulness
as
a
schoolboy
gave
no
promise
of
future
achievements
was
now
learning
the
business
of
a
seedsman
his
brother
felt
ashamed
when
he
saw
him
at
work
in
the
shop
and
had
small
patience
with
the
comrades
to
whom
oliver
dedicated
his
leisure
charlotte
was
estranged
by
religious
differences
only
for
his
mother
did
the
young
man
show
increased
consideration
to
his
aunt
he
endeavoured
to
be
grateful
but
his
behaviour
in
her
presence
was
elaborate
hypocrisy
hating
the
necessity
for
this
he
laid
the
blame
on
fortune
which
had
decreed
his
birth
in
a
social
sphere
where
he
must
ever
be
an
alien
chapter
iii
with
the
growth
of
his
militant
egoism
there
had
developed
in
godwin
peak
an
excess
of
nervous
sensibility
which
threatened
to
deprive
his
character
of
the
initiative
rightly
belonging
to
it
is
the
practical
complement
of
to
be
largely
endowed
with
the
latter
quality
yet
constrained
by
a
coward
delicacy
to
repress
it
is
to
suffer
martyrdom
at
the
pleasure
of
every
robust
assailant
and
in
the
end
be
driven
to
the
refuge
of
a
moody
solitude
that
encounter
with
his
objectionable
uncle
after
the
prize
distribution
at
whitelaw
showed
how
much
godwin
had
lost
of
the
natural
vigour
which
declared
itself
at

peak
second
visit
to
twybridge
when
the
boy
certainly
would
not
have
endured
his
uncle
presence
but
for
hospitable
considerations
and
the
respect
due
to
his
mother
the
decision
with
which
he
then
unbosomed
himself
to
oliver
still
characterised
his
thoughts
but
he
had
not
courage
to
elude
the
dialogue
forced
upon
him
still
less
to
make
known
his
resentment
of
the
man
offensive
vulgarity
he
endured
in
silence
his
heart
afire
with
scornful
wrath
the
affliction
could
not
have
befallen
him
at
a
time
when
he
was
less
capable
of
supporting
it
resignedly
notwithstanding
his
noteworthy
success
in
two
classes
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
lost
everything
that
the
day
was
one
of
signal
and
disgraceful
defeat
in
any
case
that
sequence
of
second
prizes
must
have
filled
him
with
chagrin
but
to
be
beaten
thus
repeatedly
by
such
a
fellow
as
bruno
chilvers
was
humiliation
intolerable
a
fopling
a
mincer
of
effeminate
english
a
of
academic
catchwords
bah
the
of
the
year
had
whispered
presage
but
peak
always
felt
that
he
was
not
putting
forth
his
strength
when
the
serious
trial
came
he
would
show
what
was
really
in
him
too
late
he
recognised
his
error
though
he
tried
not
to
admit
it
the
extra
subjects
had
exacted
too
much
of
him
there
was
a
limit
to
his
powers
within
the
college
this
would
be
well
enough
understood
but
to
explain
a
disagreeable
fact
is
not
to
change
it
his
name
was
written
in
pitiful
subordination
and
as
for
the
public
assembly
he
would
have
sacrificed
some
years
of
his
life
to
have
stepped
forward
in
facile
supremacy
beneath
the
eyes
of
those
clustered
ladies
instead
of
that
they
had
looked
upon
his
shame
they
had
interchanged
glances
of
amusement
at
each
repetition
of
his
defeat
had
murmured
comments
in
their
melodious
speech
had
ended
by
losing
all
interest
in
him
as
intuition
apprised
him
was
the
wont
of
women
as
soon
as
he
had
escaped
from
his
uncle
he
relapsed
into
musing
upon
the
position
to
which
he
was
condemned
when
the
new
session
came
round
again
chilvers
would
be
in
the
same
classes
with
him
and
as
likely
as
not
with
the
same
result
in
the
meantime
they
were
both
for
the
first
he
had
no
fear
of
failure
but
it
might
easily
happen
that
chilvers
would
achieve
higher
distinction
with
an
eye
to
awards
that
might
be
won
substantial
he
was
reading
for
honours
but
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
he
could
present
himself
as
the
second
examination
was
held
only
in
london
chilvers
would
of
course
be
an
honours
candidate
he
would
smile
confound
him
at
an
objection
on
the
score
of
the
necessary
journey
to
london
better
to
refrain
altogether
than
again
to
see
chilvers
come
out
ahead
general
surprise
would
naturally
be
excited
questions
asked
on
all
hands
how
would
it
sound
simply
could
afford
to
go
up
at
this
point
of
the
meditation
he
had
reached
his
lodgings
he
admitted
himself
with
a
turned
into
his
murky
and
sat
down
the
table
was
laid
for
tea
as
usual
though
he
might
have
gone
to
twybridge
this
evening
he
had
preferred
to
stay
overnight
for
an
odd
reason
at
a
theatre
in
kingsmill
a
london
company
headed
by
an
actress
of
some
distinction
was
to
perform
and
and
he
purposed
granting
himself
this
indulgence
before
leaving
the
town
the
plan
was
made
when
his
eye
fell
upon
the
advertisement
a
few
days
ago
he
then
believed
it
probable
that
an
evening
at
the
theatre
would
appropriately
follow
upon
a
day
of
victory
his
interest
in
the
performance
had
collapsed
but
he
did
not
care
to
alter
his
arrangements
the
landlady
came
in
bearing
the
he
wanted
nothing
yet
could
not
exert
himself
to
say
so
but
he
was
losing
sight
of
a
menace
more
formidable
than
defeat
by
chilvers
what
was
it
his
blackguard
uncle
had
said
had
the
fellow
really
threatened
to
start
an
opposite
the
college
and
flare
his
name
upon
a
placard
dining
and
refreshment
rooms
merciful
heavens
again
the
mood
of
laughter
came
upon
him
why
here
was
a
solution
of
all
difficulties
as
simple
as
unanticipated
if
indeed
that
awful
thing
came
to
pass
farewell
to
whitelaw
what
possibility
of
pursuing
his
studies
when
every
every
professor
nay
the
very
porters
had
become
aware
that
he
was
nephew
to
the
man
who
supplied
meals
over
the
way
moral
philosophy
had
no
prophylactic
against
an
ordeal
such
as
this
could
the
most
insignificant
lad
attending
lectures
afford
to
disregard
such
an
occasion
of
ridicule
and
contempt
but
the
scheme
would
not
be
realised
it
sounded
too
unlikely
andrew
peak
was
merely
a
vagabond
who
might
talk
of
this
and
that
project
for
making
money
but
would
certainly
never
quit
his
dirty
haunts
in
london
godwin
asked
himself
angrily
why
he
had
submitted
to
the
fellow
companionship
this
absurd
delicacy
must
be
corrected
before
it
became
his
tyrant
the
idea
of
scrupling
to
hurt
the
sensibilities
of
andrew
peak
the
man
was
enough
to
undergo
kicking
and
then
take
sixpence
in
compensation
not
a
doubt
of
it
this
detestable
tie
of
kindred
must
no
longer
be
recognised
he
would
speak
gravely
to
his
mother
about
it
if
andrew
again
presented
himself
at
the
house
he
should
be
given
plainly
to
understand
that
his
visits
were
something
less
than
welcome
if
necessary
a
downright
blunt
word
must
effect
their
liberation
godwin
felt
strong
enough
for
that
musing
here
alone
and
he
passed
on
to
debate
the
theory
of
the
problem
andrew
was
his
father
brother
but
what
is
a
mere
tie
of
blood
if
nature
has
alienated
two
persons
by
a
subtler
distinction
by
the
dead
man
andrew
had
never
been
loved
or
esteemed
memory
supplied
proof
of
this
the
widow
shrank
from
him
no
obligation
of
any
kind
lay
upon
them
to
tolerate
the
london
enough
he
should
be
got
rid
of
alternating
his
causes
of
misery
which
he
could
not
quite
forget
might
blend
for
the
sudden
transformation
of
his
life
godwin
let
the
tea
grow
cold
upon
the
table
until
it
was
time
if
he
still
meant
to
visit
the
theatre
for
setting
forth
he
had
no
mind
to
go
but
as
little
to
sit
here
and
indulge
harassing
reflection
with
an
effort
he
made
ready
and
left
the
house
the
cost
of
his
seat
at
the
theatre
was
two
shillings
so
nicely
had
he
adjusted
the
expenses
of
these
last
days
that
after
paying
the
landlady
bill
morning
there
would
remain
to
him
but
a
few
pence
more
than
the
money
needed
for
his
journey
home
walking
into
the
town
he
debated
with
himself
whether
it
were
not
better
to
save
this
florin
but
as
he
approached
the
pit
door
the
spirit
of
pleasure
revived
in
him
he
had
seen
but
one
of
shakespeare
plays
and
he
believed
naturally
at
his
age
that
to
see
a
drama
acted
was
necessary
for
its
full
appreciation
sidling
with
affected
indifference
he
added
himself
to
the
crowd
to
stand
thus
expectant
of
the
opening
doors
troubled
him
with
a
sense
of
shame
to
be
sure
he
was
in
the
spiritual
company
of
charles
lamb
and
of
many
another
man
of
brains
who
has
waited
under
the
lamp
but
contact
with
the
pittites
of
kingsmill
offended
his
instincts
he
resented
this
appearance
of
inferiority
to
people
who
came
at
their
leisure
and
took
seats
in
the
better
parts
of
the
house
when
a
neighbour
addressed
him
with
a
meaningless
joke
which
defied
grammar
he
tried
to
grin
a
friendly
answer
but
inwardly
shrank
the
events
of
the
day
had
increased
his
sensibility
to
such
impressions
had
he
triumphed
over
bruno
chilvers
he
could
have
behaved
this
evening
with
a
larger
humanity
the
fight
for
entrance
honest
british
stupidity
crushing
ribs
and
rending
garments
in
preference
to
seemly
order
of
progress
enlivened
him
somewhat
and
sent
him
laughing
to
his
conquered
place
but
before
the
curtain
rose
he
was
again
depressed
by
the
sight
of
a
familiar
figure
in
the
stalls
a
who
sat
there
with
mother
and
sister
looking
very
much
a
gentleman
of
course
am
not
a
gentleman
he
said
to
himself
gloomily
was
there
any
chance
that
he
might
some
day
take
his
ease
in
that
orthodox
fashion
inasmuch
as
it
was
conventionality
he
scorned
it
but
the
privileges
which
it
represented
had
strong
control
of
his
imagination
that
lady
and
her
daughter
would
follow
the
play
with
intelligence
to
exchange
comments
with
them
would
be
a
keen
delight
as
for
him
he
had
a
on
one
hand
and
a
grocer
wife
on
the
other
by
the
end
he
had
fallen
into
fatigue
amid
clamour
of
applause
he
made
his
way
into
the
street
to
find
himself
in
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
having
no
umbrella
he
looked
about
for
a
sheltered
station
and
the
glare
of
a
neighbouring
caught
his
eye
he
was
thirsty
and
might
as
well
refresh
body
and
spirit
with
a
glass
of
beer
an
unwonted
indulgence
which
had
the
pleasant
semblance
of
dissipation
arrived
at
the
bar
he
came
upon
two
acquaintances
who
to
judge
by
their
flushed
cheeks
and
excited
voices
had
been
celebrating
jovially
the
close
of
their
academic
labours
they
hailed
him
peak
come
and
help
us
to
get
sober
before
bedtime
they
were
not
exactly
studious
youths
but
neither
did
they
belong
to
the
class
that
godwin
despised
and
he
had
a
feeling
for
them
in
a
few
minutes
his
demeanour
was
wholly
changed
a
glass
of
hot
whisky
acted
promptly
upon
his
nervous
system
enabled
him
to
forget
vexations
and
attuned
him
to
kindred
sprightliness
he
entered
merrily
into
the
talk
of
a
time
of
life
which
is
independent
of
morality
talk
distinct
from
that
of
the
blackguard
but
equally
so
from
that
of
the
reflective
man
his
first
glass
had
several
successors
the
trio
rambled
arm
in
arm
from
one
place
of
refreshment
to
another
and
presently
sat
down
in
hearty
fellowship
to
a
supper
of
such
viands
as
recommend
themselves
at
bibulous
midnight
peak
was
drawing
recklessly
upon
the
few
coins
that
remained
to
him
he
must
leave
his
claim
undischarged
and
send
the
money
from
home
prudence
be
hanged
if
one
can
not
taste
amusement
once
in
a
twelvemonth
why
live
at
all
he
reached
his
lodgings
at
something
after
one
drenched
with
rain
gloriously
indifferent
to
that
and
all
other
chances
of
life
pooh
his
system
had
been
radically
wrong
he
should
have
allowed
himself
recreation
once
a
week
or
so
he
would
have
been
all
the
better
for
it
body
and
mind
books
and
that
kind
of
thing
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
one
must
live
he
had
wasted
too
much
of
his
youth
in
solitude
mihi
proeteritos

jupiter
annos
next
session
he
would
arrange
things
better
success
in
examinations
what
trivial
fuss
when
one
looked
at
it
from
the
right
point
of
view
and
he
had
fretted
himself
into
misery
because
chilvers
had
got
more
ha
ha
ha
the
morrow
waking
was
lugubrious
enough
headache
and
nausea
weighed
upon
him
worse
still
a
scrutiny
of
his
pockets
showed
that
he
had
only
the
shamefaced
change
of
wherewith
to
transport
himself
and
his
belongings
to
twybridge
now
the
railway
fare
alone
was
three
shillings
the
needful
cab
demanded
eighteenpence
o
idiot
and
he
hated
the
thought
of
leaving
his
bill
unpaid
the
more
so
because
it
was
a
trifling
sum
a
week
settlement
to
put
himself
under
however
brief
an
obligation
to
a
woman
such
as
the
landlady
gnawed
at
his
pride
not
that
only
he
had
no
business
to
make
a
demand
upon
his
mother
for
this
additional
sum
but
there
was
no
way
of
raising
the
money
no
one
of
whom
he
could
borrow
it
nothing
he
could
afford
to
sell
even
if
courage
had
supported
him
through
such
a
transaction
triple
idiot
bread
turned
to
bran
upon
his
hot
palate
he
could
only
swallow
cups
of
coffee
with
trembling
hands
he
finished
the
packing
of
his
box
and
portmanteau
then
braced
himself
to
the
dreaded
interview
of
course
it
involved
no
difficulty
the
words
once
uttered
but
when
he
was
left
alone
again
he
paced
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
in
flush
of
mortification
it
had
made
his
headache
worse
the
mode
of
his
homeward
journey
he
had
easily
arranged
his
baggage
having
been
labelled
for
twybridge
he
himself
would
book
as
far
as
his
money
allowed
then
proceed
on
foot
for
the
remaining
distance
with
the
elevenpence
now
in
his
pocket
he
could
purchase
a
ticket
to
a
little
town
called
dent
and
by
a
calculation
from
the
railway
tariff
he
concluded
that
from
dent
to
twybridge
was
some
miles
well
and
good
at
the
rate
of
four
miles
an
hour
it
would
take
him
from
eleven
to
about
six
he
could
certainly
reach
home
in
time
for
supper
at
dent
station
ashamed
to
ask
like
a
tramp
the
way
to
so
remote
a
place
as
twybridge
he
jotted
down
a
list
of
intervening
railway
stoppages
and
thus
was
enabled
to
support
the
semblance
of
one
who
strolls
on
for
his
pleasure
a
small
handbag
he
was
obliged
to
carry
and
the
clouded
sky
made
his
umbrella
a
requisite
on
he
trudged
steadily
for
the
most
part
by
muddy
ways
now
through
a
pleasant
village
now
in
rural
solitude
he
had
had
the
precaution
at
breakfast
time
to
store
some
pieces
of
bread
in
his
pocket
and
after
two
or
three
hours
this
resource
was
welcome
happily
the
air
and
exercise
helped
him
to
get
rid
of
his
headache
a
burst
of
sunshine
in
the
afternoon
would
have
made
him
reasonably
cheerful
but
for
the
wretched
meditations
surviving
from
yesterday
he
pondered
frequently
on
his
spasmodic
debauch
repeating
as
well
as
memory
permitted
all
his
absurdities
of
speech
and
action
defiant
was
now
far
to
seek
on
the
other
hand
he
perceived
very
clearly
how
easy
it
would
be
for
him
to
lapse
by
degrees
of
weakened
will
into
a
ruinous
dissoluteness
anything
of
that
kind
would
mean
of
course
the
abandonment
of
his
ambitions
all
he
had
to
fight
the
world
with
was
his
brain
and
only
by
incessant
strenuousness
in
its
exercise
had
he
achieved
the
moderate
prominence
declared
in
yesterday
ceremony
by
birth
by
station
he
was
of
no
account
if
he
chose
to
sink
no
influential
voice
would
deplore
his
falling
off
or
remind
him
of
what
he
owed
to
himself
chilvers
now
what
a
outcry
what
calling
upon
gods
and
men
would
be
excited
by
any
defection
of
that
brilliant
youth
godwin
peak
must
make
his
own
career
and
that
he
would
hardly
do
save
by
efforts
greater
than
the
ordinary
man
can
put
forth
the
ordinary
man
was
he
in
any
respect
extraordinary
were
his
powers
noteworthy
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
deliberately
posed
this
question
to
himself
and
for
answer
came
a
rush
of
confident
blood
pulsing
through
all
the
mechanism
of
his
being
the
train
of
thought
which
occupied
him
during
this
long
trudge
was
to
remain
fixed
in
his
memory
in
any
survey
of
the
years
of
pupilage
this
recollection
would
stand
prominently
forth
associated
moreover
with
one
slight
incident
which
at
the
time
seemed
a
mere
interruption
of
his
musing
from
a
point
on
the
he
observed
a
small
quarry
so
excavated
as
to
present
an
interesting
section
though
weary
he
could
not
but
turn
aside
to
examine
these
strata
he
knew
enough
of
the
geology
of
the
county
to
recognise
the
rocks
and
reflect
with
understanding
upon
their
position
a
fragment
in
his
hand
he
sat
down
to
rest
for
a
moment
then
a
strange
fit
of
brooding
came
over
him
escaping
from
the
influences
of
personality
his
imagination
wrought
back
through
eras
of
geologic
time
held
him
in
a
vision
of
the
infinitely
remote
shrivelled
into
insignificance
all
but
the
one
fact
of
inconceivable
duration
often
as
he
had
lost
himself
in
such
reveries
never
yet
had
he
passed
so
wholly
under
the
dominion
of
that
awe
which
attends
a
sudden
triumph
of
the
pure
intellect
when
at
length
he
rose
it
was
with
wide
blank
eyes
and
limbs
partly
numbed
these
needed
walking
before
he
could
recover
his
mood
of
practical
until
the
last
moment
he
could
not
decide
whether
to
let
his
mother
know
how
he
had
reached
twybridge
his
arrival
corresponded
pretty
well
with
that
of
a
train
by
which
he
might
have
come
but
when
the
door
opened
to
him
and
the
familiar
faces
smiled
their
welcome
he
felt
that
he
must
have
nothing
to
do
with
paltry
deceit
he
told
of
his
walk
explaining
it
by
the
simple
fact
that
this
morning
he
had
found
himself
short
of
money
how
that
came
to
pass
no
one
inquired
mrs
peak
shocked
at
such
martyrdom
tended
him
with
all
motherly
care
for
once
godwin
felt
that
it
was
good
to
have
a
home
however
simple
this
amiable
frame
of
mind
was
not
likely
to
last
beyond
the
first
day
matter
of
irritation
soon
enough
offered
itself
as
was
invariably
the
case
at
twybridge
it
was
pleasant
enough
to
be
feted
as
the
hero
of
the
family
to
pull
out
a
kingsmill
newspaper
and
exhibit
the
full
report
of
at
whitelaw
with
his
own
name
in
very
small
type
demanding
the
world
attention
and
finally
to
exhibit
the
volumes
in
which
his
friend
the
librarian
had
forwarded
to
him
but
domestic
circumstances
soon
made
assault
upon
his
nerves
and
trial
of
his
brief
patience
first
of
all
there
came
an
unexpected
disclosure
his
sister
charlotte
had
affianced
herself
to
a
young
man
of
twybridge
one
mr
cusse
whose
prospects
were
as
slender
as
his
present
means
mrs
peak
spoke
of
the
affair
in
hushed
privacy
with
shaking
of
the
head
and
frequent
sighs
for
to
her
mind
cusse
had
few
even
personal
recommendations
he
was
a
draper
assistant
charlotte
had
made
his
acquaintance
on
occasions
of
church
festivity
and
urged
the
fact
of
his
zeal
in
tuition
as
sufficient
reply
to
all
doubts
as
he
listened
godwin
bit
his
lips
he
come
here
then
was
his
inquiry
or
twice
a
week
i
have
felt
able
to
say
anything
against
it
godwin
i
suppose
it
will
be
a
very
long
engagement
charlotte
was
just
and
it
seemed
probable
that
she
knew
her
own
mind
in
any
case
she
was
of
a
character
which
would
only
be
driven
to
obstinacy
by
adverse
criticism
godwin
learnt
that
his
aunt
emily
miss
cadman
regarded
this
connection
with
serious
disapproval
herself
a
shopkeeper
she
might
have
been
expected
to
show
indulgence
to
a
draper
assistant
but
so
far
from
this
her
view
of
cusse
was
severely
scornful
she
had
nourished
far
other
hopes
for
charlotte
who
surely
at
her
age
miss
cadman
looked
from
the
eminence
of
should
have
been
less
precipitate
no
undue
harshness
had
been
exhibited
by
her
relatives
but
charlotte
took
a
stand
which
sufficiently
declared
her
kindred
with
godwin
she
held
her
head
higher
than
formerly
spoke
with
habitual
decision
which
bordered
on
snappishness
and
at
times
displayed
the
absentmindedness
of
one
who
in
silence
suffers
wrong
there
passed
but
a
day
or
two
before
godwin
was
brought
face
to
face
with
cusse
who
answered
too
well
to
the
idea
charlotte
brother
had
formed
of
him
he
had
a
very
smooth
and
shiny
forehead
crowned
by
sleek
chestnut
hair
his
chin
was
deferential
the
bend
of
his
body
signified
a
modest
hope
that
he
did
his
duty
in
the
station
to
which
providence
had
summoned
him
godwin
he
sought
to
flatter
with
looks
of
admiring
interest
also
by
entering
upon
a
conversation
which
was
meant
to
prove
that
he
did
not
altogether
lack
worldly
knowledge
of
however
little
moment
that
might
be
in
comparison
with
spiritual
concerns
examining
volume
by
volume
and
with
painful
minuteness
the
prizes
godwin
had
carried
off
he
remarked
fervently
in
each
instance
can
see
how
very
interesting
that
is
so
thorough
so
thorough
even
charlotte
was
at
length
annoyed
when
cusse
had
exclaimed
upon
the
of
ben
jonson
works
she
asked
an
abrupt
question
about
some
town
affair
and
so
gave
her
brother
an
opportunity
of
taking
the
books
away
there
was
no
flagrant
offence
in
the
man
he
spoke
with
passable
accent
and
manifested
a
high
degree
of
amiability
but
one
could
not
dissociate
him
from
the
counter
at
the
thought
that
his
sister
might
become
cusse
godwin
ground
his
teeth
now
that
he
came
to
reflect
on
the
subject
he
found
in
himself
a
sort
of
unreasoned
supposition
that
charlotte
would
always
remain
single
it
seemed
so
unlikely
that
she
would
be
sought
by
a
man
of
liberal
standing
and
at
the
same
time
so
impossible
for
her
to
accept
any
one
less
than
a
gentleman
yet
he
remembered
that
to
outsiders
such
fastidiousness
must
show
in
a
ridiculous
light
what
claim
to
gentility
had
they
the
peaks
was
it
not
all
a
figment
of
his
own
even
in
education
charlotte
could
barely
assert
a
superiority
to
cusse
for
her
formal
schooling
had
ended
when
she
was
twelve
and
she
had
never
cared
to
read
beyond
the
strait
track
clerical
inspiration
there
were
other
circumstances
which
helped
to
depress
his
estimate
of
the
family
dignity
his
brother
oliver
now
seventeen
was
developing
into
a
type
of
young
man
as
objectionable
as
it
is
easily
recognised
the
slow
compliant
boy
had
grown
more
flesh
and
muscle
than
once
seemed
likely
and
his
wits
had
begun
to
display
that
kind
of
vivaciousness
which
is
only
compatible
with
a
nature
moulded
in
common
clay
he
saw
much
company
and
all
of
low
intellectual
order
he
had
purchased
a
bicycle
and
regarded
it
as
a
source
of
distinction
a
means
of
displaying
himself
before
shopkeepers
daughters
he
believed
himself
a
modest
tenor
and
sang
verses
of
sentimental
imbecility
he
took
in
several
weekly
papers
of
unpromising
title
for
the
chief
purpose
of
deciphering
cryptograms
in
which
pursuit
he
had
singular
success
add
to
these
characteristics
a
penchant
for
cheap
jewellery
and
oliver
peak
stands
confessed
it
appeared
to
godwin
that
his
brother
had
leapt
in
a
few
months
to
these
heights
of
vulgar
accomplishment
each
separate
revelation
struck
unexpectedly
upon
his
nerves
and
severely
tried
his
temper
when
at
length
oliver
waiting
for
supper
began
to
dance
grotesquely
to
an
air
which
local
talent
had
somehow
caught
from
the
london
godwin
gave
way
it
your
ambition
he
asked
with
fiery
sarcasm
join
a
troupe
of
nigger
minstrels
oliver
was
startled
into
the
military
posture
of
attention
he
answered
with
some
embarrassment
ca
say
it
is
anyone
would
suppose
so
went
on
godwin
hotly
you
are
employed
in
a
shop
i
should
have
thought
you
might
still
aim
at
behaving
like
a
gentleman
indisposed
to
quarrel
and
possessed
of
small
skill
in
verbal
fence
oliver
drew
aside
with
shadowed
brow
as
the
brothers
still
had
to
share
one
bedroom
they
were
presently
alone
together
and
their
muteness
as
they
lay
down
to
sleep
showed
the
estrangement
that
had
at
length
come
between
them
when
all
had
been
dark
and
still
for
godwin
spoke
you
awake
was
something
about
uncle
andrew
i
did
mention
he
talks
of
opening
an
just
opposite
whitelaw
the
tone
of
this
signified
nothing
more
than
curiosity
do
see
any
reason
why
he
should
oliver
delayed
a
little
before
replying
suppose
it
would
be
very
nice
for
you
rather
a
mild
way
of
putting
it
it
would
mean
that
i
should
have
to
leave
the
college
and
give
up
all
my
hopes
see
returned
the
other
with
slow
apprehension
there
followed
several
minutes
of
silence
then
godwin
sat
up
in
bed
as
had
always
been
his
wont
when
he
talked
with
earnestness
at
night
you
think
i
lost
my
temper
without
cause
at
suppertime
just
remember
that
i
had
that
blackguard
before
my
mind
and
that
it
very
pleasant
to
see
you
taking
after
that
branch
of
our
family
you
mean
to
say
i
am
like
uncle
mean
to
say
that
if
you
are
not
careful
you
wo
be
the
kind
of
man
i
should
like
to
see
you
do
you
know
what
is
meant
by
inherited
tendencies
scientific
men
are
giving
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
such
things
nowadays
children
do
always
take
after
their
parents
very
often
they
show
a
much
stronger
likeness
to
a
grandfather
or
an
uncle
or
even
more
distant
relatives
just
think
over
this
and
make
up
your
mind
to
resist
any
danger
of
that
sort
i
tell
you
plainly
that
the
habits
you
are
getting
into
and
the
people
you
make
friends
of
are
detestable
for
heaven
sake
spend
more
of
your
time
in
a
rational
way
and
learn
to
despise
the
things
that
shopkeepers
admire
read
force
yourself
to
stick
hard
at
solid
books
for
two
or
three
hours
every
day
if
you
do
it
all
up
with
you
i
am
speaking
for
your
own
good
read
read
read
quietness
ensued
then
oliver
began
to
move
uneasily
in
his
bed
and
at
length
his
protest
became
audible
ca
see
what
harm
i
do
burst
from
his
brother
lips
scornfully
that
just
your
danger
do
you
suppose
could
sing
nigger
songs
and
run
about
the
town
with
shopboys
and
waste
hours
over
idiotic
puzzles
not
all
alike
and
it
would
do
for
us
to
be
would
do
very
well
for
us
all
to
have
brains
and
to
use
them
the
life
you
lead
is
a
brainless
life
brainless
and
vulgar
if
i
have
got
brains
i
ca
help
it
replied
oliver
with
sullen
resignation
have
enough
to
teach
you
to
live
respectably
if
only
you
look
to
the
right
kind
of
example
there
followed
a
vehement
exhortation
now
angry
now
in
strain
of
natural
kindliness
to
this
oliver
made
only
a
few
brief
and
muttered
replies
when
it
was
all
over
he
fell
asleep
but
godwin
was
wakeful
for
hours
the
next
morning
he
attempted
to
work
for
his
approaching
examination
but
with
small
result
it
had
begun
to
be
very
doubtful
to
him
whether
he
should
up
at
all
and
this
uncertainty
involved
so
great
a
change
in
all
his
prospects
that
he
could
not
command
the
mental
calm
necessary
for
study
after
dinner
he
went
out
with
unsettled
purpose
he
would
gladly
have
conversed
with
mr
gunnery
but
the
old
people
were
just
now
on
a
stay
with
relatives
in
bedfordshire
and
their
return
might
be
delayed
for
another
week
perhaps
it
behoved
him
to
go
and
see
moxey
but
he
was
indisposed
to
visit
the
works
and
if
he
went
to
the
house
this
evening
he
would
encounter
the
five
daughters
who
like
all
women
who
did
not
inspire
him
with
admiration
excited
his
bashful
dislike
at
length
he
struck
off
into
the
country
and
indulged
restless
thoughts
in
places
where
no
one
could
observe
him
a
result
of
the
family
removal
first
from
london
to
the
farm
and
then
into
twybridge
was
that
godwin
had
no
friends
of
old
standing
at
greenwich
nicholas
peak
formed
no
intimacies
nor
did
a
single
associate
remain
to
him
from
the
years
of
his
growth
and
struggle
his
wife
until
the
renewal
of
intercourse
with
her
sister
at
twybridge
had
no
society
whatever
beyond
her
home
a
boy
reaps
advantage
from
the
half
parental
kindness
of
men
and
women
who
have
watched
his
growth
from
infancy
in
general
it
affects
him
as
a
steadying
influence
keeping
before
his
mind
the
social
bonds
to
which
his
behaviour
owes
allegiance
the
only
person
whom
godwin
regarded
with
feeling
akin
to
this
was
gunnery
but
the
geologist
found
no
favour
with
mrs
peak
and
thus
he
involuntarily
helped
to
widen
the
gap
between
the
young
man
and
his
relatives
nor
had
the
intimacies
of
school
time
supplied
godwin
with
friendships
for
the
years
to
come
his
twybridge
no
longer
interested
him
nor
did
they
care
to
continue
his
acquaintance
one
was
articled
to
a
solicitor
one
was
learning
the
in
his
father
shop
another
had
begun
to
deal
in
corn
the
rest
were
scattered
about
england
as
students
or
the
dominion
of
the
commonplace
had
absorbed
them
all
and
sundry
they
were
the
stuff
which
destiny
uses
for
its
purposes
to
keep
the
world
so
that
godwin
had
no
ties
which
bound
him
strongly
to
any
district
he
could
not
call
himself
a
londoner
for
though
born
in
westminster
he
had
grown
to
consciousness
on
the
outskirts
of
greenwich
and
remembered
but
dimly
some
of
the
london
streets
and
a
few
places
of
public
interest
to
which
his
father
had
taken
him
yet
as
a
matter
of
course
it
was
to
london
that
his
ambition
pointed
when
he
forecast
the
future
where
else
could
he
hope
for
opportunity
of
notable
advancement
at
twybridge
impossible
to
find
more
than
means
of
subsistence
his
soul
loathed
such
a
prospect
at
kingsmill
there
was
a
slender
hope
that
he
might
establish
a
connection
with
whitelaw
college
if
he
devoted
himself
to
laboratory
work
but
what
could
come
of
that
at
all
events
for
many
years
london
then
the
only
acceptable
plan
for
supporting
himself
there
was
to
succeed
in
a
civil
service
competition
that
indeed
seemed
the
most
hopeful
direction
for
his
efforts
a
government
office
might
afford
him
scope
and
he
had
heard
would
allow
him
abundant
leisure
or
to
go
abroad
to
enter
for
the
indian
clerkships
and
possibly
cleave
a
wider
way
than
could
be
hoped
in
england
there
was
allurement
in
the
suggestion
travel
had
always
tempted
his
fancy
in
that
case
he
would
be
safely
severed
from
the
humble
origin
which
in
his
native
country
might
long
be
an
annoyance
or
even
an
obstacle
no
uncle
andrew
could
spring
up
at
inconvenient
moments
in
the
middle
of
his
path
yes
this
indeed
might
be
best
of
all
he
must
send
for
papers
and
give
attention
to
the
matter
musing
in
this
way
he
had
come
within
sight
of
the
familiar
chemical
works
it
was
near
the
hour
at
which
moxey
was
about
to
go
home
for
his
afternoon
dinner
why
not
interrupt
his
walk
and
have
a
word
with
him
that
duty
would
be
over
he
pushed
on
and
as
he
approached
the
buildings
was
aware
of
mr
moxey
stepping
into
the
road
unaccompanied
greetings
speedily
followed
the
manufacturer
who
was
growing
stout
in
his
mellow
years
and
looking
more
leisurely
than
when
godwin
first
knew
him
beamed
with
smiles
of
approbation
to
see
you
glad
to
see
you
i
have
heard
of
your
doings
at
college
to
boast
of
mr
moxey
what
would
satisfy
you
a
nephew
of
mine
was
there
last
friday
and
tells
me
you
carried
off
half
a
hundredweight
of
prizes
here
he
comes
i
see
there
drew
near
a
young
man
of
about
sauntering
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
his
name
was
christian
moxey
pleasure
in
meeting
you
mr
peak
he
said
with
a
winning
smile
was
at
whitelaw
the
other
day
when
you
distinguished
yourself
and
if
i
had
known
then
that
you
were
an
acquaintance
of
my
uncle
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
offer
a
word
of
congratulation
very
glad
indeed
to
meet
you
godwin
grateful
as
always
for
the
show
of
kindness
and
flattered
by
such
a
reception
at
once
felt
a
liking
for
christian
moxey
most
people
would
have
admitted
the
young
man
attractiveness
he
had
a
thin
and
sallow
face
and
seemed
to
be
of
weak
constitution
in
talking
he
leant
upon
his
cane
and
his
movements
were
languid
none
the
less
his
person
was
distinguished
by
an
air
of
graceful
manhood
his
features
separately
considered
were
ordinary
enough
together
they
made
a
countenance
of
peculiar
charm
vividly
illumined
full
of
appeal
to
whosoever
could
appreciate
emotional
capabilities
the
interest
he
excited
in
peak
appeared
to
be
reciprocal
for
his
eyes
dwelt
as
often
and
as
long
as
possible
on
godwin
features
along
and
have
something
to
eat
with
us
said
moxey
in
a
tone
of
genial
invitation
daresay
you
had
dinner
long
enough
ago
to
have
picked
up
a
new
appetite
godwin
had
a
perturbing
vision
of
the
five
miss
moxeys
and
of
a
dinner
table
such
as
he
was
not
used
to
sit
at
he
wished
to
decline
yet
knew
not
how
to
do
so
with
civility
yes
come
along
added
his
friend
heartily
us
something
about
your
chemistry
paper
any
posers
this
time
my
nephew
wo
be
out
of
it
he
belongs
to
the
firm
of
bates
brothers
the
rotherhithe
people
you
know
this
information
was
a
surprise
to
godwin
he
had
imagined
christian
moxey
either
a
gentleman
at
large
or
at
all
events
connected
with
some
liberal
profession
glancing
at
the
attractive
face
he
met
a
singular
look
a
smile
which
suggested
vague
doubts
but
christian
made
no
remark
and
moxey
renewed
his
inquiries
about
the
examination
in
chemistry
the
five
daughters
all
assembled
in
a
homely
were
nothing
less
than
formidable
plain
not
ill
educated
they
seemed
to
live
in
perfect
harmony
and
to
derive
satisfaction
from
pursuits
independent
of
external
society
in
the
town
they
were
seldom
seen
few
families
called
upon
them
and
only
the
most
inveterate
gossips
found
matter
for
in
their
retired
lives
it
had
never
been
heard
that
any
one
of
them
was
sought
in
marriage
godwin
superfluously
troubled
about
his
attire
met
them
with
grim
endeavour
at
politeness
their
gravity
a
result
of
shyness
he
misinterpreted
supposing
them
to
hold
aloof
from
a
young
man
who
had
been
in
their
father
employ
but
before
he
could
suffer
much
from
the
necessity
of
formal
conversation
the
door
opened
to
admit
yet
another
young
lady
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
her
age
was
about
seventeen
but
she
had
nothing
of
the
sprightly
grace
proverbially
connected
with
that
time
of
life
in
girls
her
pale
and
freckled
visage
expressed
a
haughty
reserve
intensified
as
soon
as
her
eye
fell
upon
the
visitor
she
had
a
slight
but
figure
and
a
mass
of
auburn
hair
carelessly
arranged
sister
said
christian
glancing
at
godwin
you
recognise
mr
peak
yes
the
girl
replied
as
she
came
forward
and
made
a
sudden
offer
of
her
hand
she
too
had
been
present
the
other
day
at
whitelaw
her
sounded
offensive
to
godwin
yet
in
shaking
hands
with
her
he
felt
a
warm
pressure
and
it
flattered
him
when
he
became
aware
that
marcella
regarded
him
from
time
to
time
with
furtive
interest
presently
he
learnt
that
christian
and
his
sister
were
on
a
short
visit
at
the
house
of
their
relatives
their
home
was
in
london
marcella
had
seated
herself
stiffly
by
a
window
and
seemed
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
view
without
than
to
the
talk
which
went
on
until
dinner
was
announced
speculating
on
all
he
saw
godwin
noticed
that
christian
moxey
showed
a
marked
preference
for
the
youngest
of
his
cousins
a
girl
of
eighteen
whose
plain
features
were
frequently
brightened
with
a
happy
and
very
pleasant
smile
when
he
addressed
her
by
the
name
of
janet
his
voice
had
a
playful
kindness
which
must
have
been
significant
to
everyone
who
heard
it
at
dinner
his
place
was
by
her
side
and
he
attended
to
her
with
more
than
courtesy
this
astonished
peak
he
deemed
it
incredible
that
any
man
should
conceive
a
tender
feeling
for
a
girl
so
far
from
beautiful
constantly
occupied
with
thought
of
sexual
attachments
he
had
never
imagined
anything
of
the
kind
apart
from
loveliness
of
feature
in
the
chosen
object
his
instincts
were
in
fact
revolted
by
the
idea
of
love
for
such
a
person
as
janet
moxey
christian
seemed
to
be
degraded
by
such
a
suggestion
in
his
endeavour
to
solve
the
mystery
godwin
grew
half
unconscious
of
the
other
people
about
him
such
play
of
the
imaginative
and
speculative
faculties
accounts
for
the
common
awkwardness
of
intelligent
young
men
in
society
that
is
strange
to
them
only
the
cultivation
of
a
double
consciousness
puts
them
finally
at
ease
impossible
to
converse
with
suavity
and
to
heed
the
forms
of
ordinary
when
the
brain
is
absorbed
in
all
manner
of
new
problems
one
must
learn
to
act
a
part
to
control
the
facial
mechanism
to
observe
and
anticipate
even
whilst
the
intellect
is
spending
its
sincere
energy
on
subjects
unavowed
the
perfectly
graceful
man
will
always
be
he
who
has
no
strong
apprehension
either
of
his
own
personality
or
of
that
of
others
who
lives
on
the
surface
of
things
who
can
be
interested
without
emotion
and
surprised
without
contemplative
impulse
never
yet
had
godwin
peak
uttered
a
word
that
was
worth
listening
to
or
made
a
remark
that
declared
his
mental
powers
save
in
most
familiar
colloquy
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
various
reasons
of
his
seeming
clownishness
but
this
very
process
of
opposed
an
obstacle
to
improvement
when
he
found
himself
obliged
to
take
part
in
conversation
about
whitelaw
college
godwin
was
disturbed
by
an
uncertainty
which
had
never
left
his
mind
at
rest
during
the
past
two
years
was
it
or
was
it
not
generally
known
to
his
twybridge
acquaintances
that
he
studied
as
the
pensioner
of
sir
job
whitelaw
to
outward
seeming
all
delicacy
had
been
exercised
in
the
bestowal
of
sir
job
benefaction
at
the
beginning
of
each
academic
session
mrs
peak
had
privately
received
a
cheque
which
represented
the
exact
outlay
in
fees
for
the
course
her
son
was
pursuing
payment
was
then
made
to
the
registrar
as
if
from
peak
himself
but
lady
whitelaw
sisters
were
in
the
secret
and
was
it
likely
that
they
maintained
absolute
discretion
in
talking
with
their
twybridge
friends
there
seemed
in
the
first
instance
to
be
a
tacit
understanding
that
the
whole
affair
should
remain
strictly
private
and
to
godwin
himself
sensible
enough
of
such
refinements
it
was
by
no
means
inconceivable
that
silence
had
been
strictly
preserved
he
found
no
difficulty
in
imagining
that
sir
job
right
hand
knew
nothing
of
what
the
left
performed
and
it
might
be
that
the
authorities
of
whitelaw
had
no
hint
of
his
peculiar
position
still
he
was
perchance
mistaken
the
professors
perhaps
regarded
him
as
a
sort
of
and
twybridge
possibly
saw
him
in
the
same
light
the
doubt
flashed
upon
his
mind
while
he
was
trying
to
eat
and
converse
with
becoming
he
dug
his
heel
into
the
carpet
and
silently
cursed
the
burden
of
his
servitude
when
the
meal
was
over
moxey
led
the
way
out
into
the
garden
christian
walked
apart
with
janet
godwin
strolled
about
between
his
host
and
the
eldest
miss
moxey
talking
of
he
knew
not
what
in
a
short
he
screwed
up
his
courage
to
the
point
of
marcella
and
three
of
her
cousins
had
disappeared
so
that
the
awkwardness
of
departure
was
reduced
christian
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
contented
mood
accompanied
the
guest
as
far
as
the
garden
gate
will
be
your
special
line
of
work
when
you
leave
whitelaw
he
inquired
tastes
seem
about
equally
divided
between
science
and
literature
have
the
least
idea
what
i
shall
do
was
peak
reply
much
my
own
state
of
mind
when
i
came
home
from
zurich
a
year
ago
but
it
had
been
taken
for
granted
that
i
was
preparing
for
business
so
into
business
i
went
he
laughed
you
will
be
drawn
to
london
i
think
it
likely
godwin
answered
with
an
absent
glance
this
way
and
that
any
case
pursued
the
other
be
there
presently
for
first
honours
try
to
look
in
at
my
rooms
will
you
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
you
most
of
my
day
is
spent
in
the
romantic
locality
of
rotherhithe
but
i
get
home
about
five
as
a
rule
let
me
give
you
a
card
you
daresay
we
shall
meet
somewhere
about
here
before
then
of
course
you
are
reading
hard
and
have
much
leisure
i
an
idle
dog
unfortunately
i
should
like
to
work
but
i
do
quite
know
what
at
i
suppose
this
is
a
transition
time
with
me
godwin
tried
to
discover
the
implication
of
this
remark
had
it
any
reference
to
miss
janet
moxey
whilst
he
stood
in
embarrassed
silence
christian
looked
about
with
a
peculiar
smile
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
indulging
in
further
but
godwin
of
a
sudden
held
out
his
hand
for
and
with
friendly
smiles
they
parted
peak
was
older
than
his
years
and
he
saw
in
christian
one
who
might
prove
a
very
congenial
associate
did
but
circumstances
favour
their
intercourse
that
was
not
very
likely
to
happen
but
the
meeting
at
all
events
turned
his
thoughts
to
london
once
more
his
attempts
to
were
still
unfruitful
for
one
thing
the
stress
and
excitement
of
the
whitelaw
examinations
had
wearied
him
it
was
characteristic
of
the
educational
system
in
which
he
had
become
involved
that
studious
effort
should
be
called
for
immediately
after
that
frenzy
of
college
competition
he
ought
now
to
have
been
at
his
london
subjects
instead
of
that
he
procured
works
of
general
literature
from
a
twybridge
library
and
shut
himself
up
with
them
in
the
garret
bedroom
a
letter
from
gunnery
informed
him
that
the
writer
would
be
home
in
a
day
or
two
this
return
took
place
late
one
evening
and
on
the
morrow
godwin
set
forth
to
visit
his
friend
on
reaching
the
house
he
learnt
that
gunnery
had
suffered
an
accident
which
threatened
serious
results
walking
barefoot
in
his
bedroom
the
night
before
he
had
stepped
upon
the
point
of
a
large
nail
and
was
now
prostrate
enduring
much
pain
two
days
elapsed
before
godwin
could
be
admitted
he
then
found
the
old
man
a
mere
shadow
of
his
familiar
self
bloodless
is
the
kind
of
practical
joke
that
fate
likes
to
play
upon
us
the
sufferer
growled
in
a
harsh
quaking
voice
his
countenance
divided
between
genial
welcome
and
surly
wrath
be
the
end
of
me
pooh
who
does
know
that
such
a
thing
is
fatal
at
my
age
has
fairly
begun
i
a
good
deal
rather
have
broken
my
neck
among
honest
lumps
of
old
red
sandstone
a
nail
a
damned
brummagem
nail
so
you
collared
the
first
prize
in
geology
eh
i
take
that
as
a
kindness
godwin
you
got
a
bit
beyond
figuier
and
his
eh
his
deluge
bah
and
he
laughed
discordantly
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
sat
mrs
gunnery
grizzled
and
feeble
dame
shaken
into
the
last
stage
of
senility
by
this
alarm
she
wiped
tears
from
her
flaccid
cheeks
and
moaned
a
few
unintelligible
words
the
geologist
forecast
of
doom
was
speedily
justified
another
day
bereft
him
of
consciousness
and
when
for
a
short
while
he
had
rambled
among
memories
of
his
youth
the
end
came
it
was
found
that
he
had
made
a
will
bequeathing
his
collections
and
scientific
instruments
to
godwin
peak
his
books
were
to
be
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
widow
who
would
enjoy
an
annuity
purchased
out
of
her
husband
savings
the
poor
old
woman
as
it
proved
had
little
need
of
income
on
the
thirteenth
day
after
gunnery
funeral
she
too
was
borne
forth
from
the
house
and
the
faithful
couple
slept
together
to
inherit
from
the
dead
was
an
impressive
experience
to
godwin
at
the
present
stage
of
his
development
every
circumstance
affecting
him
started
his
mind
upon
the
quest
of
reasons
symbolisms
principles
the
supernatural
had
hold
upon
him
and
ruled
his
thought
whenever
it
was
free
from
the
spur
of
arrogant
instinct
this
tendency
had
been
strengthened
by
the
influence
of
his
friend
earwaker
a
young
man
of
singularly
complex
personality
positive
and
analytic
in
a
far
higher
degree
than
peak
yet
with
a
vein
of
imaginative
vigour
which
seemed
to
befit
quite
a
different
order
of
mind
godwin
was
not
distinguished
by
originality
in
thinking
but
his
strongly
featured
character
converted
to
uses
of
his
own
the
intellectual
suggestions
he
so
rapidly
caught
from
others
earwaker
habit
of
reflection
had
much
to
do
with
the
strange
feelings
awakened
in
godwin
when
he
transferred
to
his
mother
house
the
cabinets
which
had
been
gunnery
pride
for
thirty
or
forty
years
joy
of
possession
was
subdued
in
him
by
the
conflict
of
metaphysical
questionings
days
went
on
and
nothing
was
heard
of
uncle
andrew
godwin
tried
to
assure
himself
that
he
had
been
needlessly
terrified
the
project
would
never
be
carried
out
practically
dismissing
that
anxiety
he
brooded
over
his
defeat
by
chilvers
and
thought
with
extreme
reluctance
of
the
year
still
to
be
spent
at
whitelaw
probably
a
year
of
humiliation
in
the
meantime
should
he
or
should
he
not
present
himself
for
his
first
the
five
pound
fee
would
be
a
most
serious
demand
upon
his
mother
resources
and
did
the
profit
warrant
it
was
it
really
of
importance
to
him
to
take
a
degree
he
lived
as
much
as
possible
alone
generally
avoiding
the
society
of
his
relatives
save
at
meal
times
a
careless
remark
not
intentionally
offensive
with
reference
to
cusse
had
so
affronted
charlotte
that
she
never
spoke
to
him
save
in
reply
to
a
question
godwin
regretted
the
pain
he
had
given
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
express
this
feeling
for
a
discussion
would
inevitably
have
disclosed
all
his
mind
concerning
the
draper
assistant
oliver
seemed
to
have
forgiven
his
brother
reproaches
but
no
longer
behaved
with
freedom
when
godwin
was
present
for
all
this
the
elder
irritation
was
often
aroused
by
things
he
saw
and
heard
and
at
length
on
a
memorable
saturday
afternoon
debate
revived
between
them
oliver
as
his
custom
was
had
attired
himself
sprucely
for
a
visit
to
acquaintances
and
a
silk
hat
of
the
very
newest
fashion
lay
together
with
his
gloves
upon
the
table
is
this
thing
inquired
godwin
with
ominous
calm
as
he
pointed
to
the
piece
of
hat
i
suppose
replied
his
brother
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
wear
that
in
the
street
why
not
oliver
not
venturing
to
raise
his
eyes
stared
at
the
indignantly
you
feel
burst
from
the
other
it
a
disgrace
to
buy
and
wear
such
a
thing
what
the
matter
with
the
hat
it
the
fashionable
shape
godwin
mastered
his
wrath
and
turned
contemptuously
away
but
oliver
had
been
touched
in
a
sensitive
place
he
was
eager
to
defend
himself
ca
see
what
you
finding
fault
with
he
exclaimed
wears
this
shape
is
that
quite
sufficient
reason
why
anyone
who
respects
himself
should
choose
something
as
different
as
possible
everybody
that
is
to
say
all
the
fools
in
the
kingdom
it
bad
enough
to
follow
when
you
ca
help
it
but
to
imitate
asses
gratuitously
is
the
lowest
depth
of
degradation
do
you
know
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
vulgarity
how
you
can
offer
such
an
excuse
passes
my
comprehension
have
you
no
self
are
you
made
like
this
hat
on
a
pattern
with
a
hundred
thousand
others
and
i
are
different
said
oliver
impatiently
am
content
to
be
like
other
people
i
would
poison
myself
with
if
i
felt
any
risk
of
such
contentment
like
other
people
heaven
forbid
and
forfend
like
other
people
oh
what
a
noble
ambition
the
loud
passionate
voice
summoned
mrs
peak
from
an
adjacent
room
godwin
she
remonstrated
is
it
why
should
you
put
yourself
out
so
she
was
a
short
and
slender
woman
with
an
air
of
gentility
independent
of
her
badly
made
and
long
worn
widow
dress
marked
her
manner
and
the
even
tones
in
which
she
spoke
gave
indication
of
a
mild
perhaps
an
unemotional
temperament
oliver
began
to
represent
his
grievance
harm
is
there
if
i
choose
to
wear
a
hat
that
in
fashion
i
pay
for
it
out
of
my
own
but
he
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
visitor
knock
at
the
front
door
distant
only
a
few
paces
mrs
peak
turned
with
a
startled
look
godwin
dreading
contact
with
friends
of
the
family
strode
upstairs
when
the
door
was
opened
there
appeared
the
smiling
countenance
of
andrew
peak
he
wore
the
costume
of
a
traveller
and
by
his
side
stood
a
boy
of
ten
too
plainly
his
son
grace
was
his
familiar
greeting
as
the
widow
drew
back
told
you
you
the
pleasure
of
seem
me
again
before
so
very
long
godwin
at
with
you
i
thet
you
noll

my
yer
cousin
jowey
shike
jowey
sorry
i
bring
my
old
lady
over
this
time
grace
she
sends
her
respects
as
usual
charlotte
bloomin
i
he
had
made
his
way
into
the
front
parlour
dragging
the
youngster
after
him
having
deposited
his
handbag
and
umbrella
on
the
sofa
he
seated
himself
in
the
and
began
to
blow
his
nose
with
vigour
down
jowey
set
down
dow
be
afride
of
your
awnt
ai
afride
cried
the
youth
in
a
tone
which
supported
his
assertion
mrs
peak
trembled
with
annoyance
and
indecision
andrew
evidently
meant
to
stay
for
some
time
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
treat
him
with
plain
discourtesy
but
she
saw
that
oliver
after
shaking
hands
in
a
very
strained
way
had
abruptly
left
the
room
and
godwin
would
be
anything
but
willing
to
meet
his
uncle
when
the
name
of
her
elder
son
was
again
mentioned
she
withdrew
on
the
pretence
of
summoning
him
and
went
up
to
his
room
godwin
had
heard
the
hateful
voice
and
was
in
profound
disturbance
does
he
say
mother
he
inquired
anxiously
about
kingsmill
yet
oh
i
so
wish
we
could
bring
this
connection
to
an
end
it
was
the
first
time
mrs
peak
had
uttered
her
sentiments
so
unreservedly
shall
i
see
him
in
private
said
godwin
simply
let
him
know
the
truth
dread
the
thought
of
that
godwin
he
would
very
likely
be
coarse
and
violent
i
must
try
to
show
him
by
my
manner
oliver
has
gone
out
and
when
charlotte
comes
home
i
tell
her
to
keep
out
of
sight
he
has
brought
his
boy
suppose
you
do
come
down
at
all
i
might
say
you
are
too
busy
no
you
sha
have
to
do
it
all
alone
i
come
down
with
you
i
must
hear
what
he
has
to
say
they
descended
as
soon
as
his
nephew
appeared
andrew
sprang
up
and
shouted
joyfully
godwin
it
all
settled
got
the
bloomin
shop
from

quarter

and
refreshment
rooms
jowey
an
me
was
over
there
all
yisterday
was
us
jowey
oh
it
immense
godwin
felt
the
blood
buzz
in
his
ears
and
a
hot
choking
clutch
at
his
throat
he
took
his
stand
by
the
mantelpiece
and
began
to
turn
a
little
glass
ornament
round
and
round
fate
had
spoken
on
the
instant
all
his
college
life
was
far
behind
him
all
his
uneasiness
regarding
the
next
session
was
dispelled
and
he
had
no
more
connection
with
kingsmill
mrs
peak
had
heard
from
oliver
of
her
proposed
undertaking
she
had
spoken
of
it
with
anxiety
to
godwin
who
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
avoided
the
topic
ashamed
to
dwell
on
the
particulars
of
his
shame
in
hearing
andrew
announcement
she
had
much
ado
to
repress
tears
of
vexation
silently
she
seated
herself
and
looked
with
pained
countenance
from
uncle
to
nephew
you
make
any
changes
in
the
place
godwin
asked
carelessly
i
jest
it
take
a
month
to
refit
them
eatin
rooms
agoin
to
do
it
proper
up
to
dick
and
i
want
your
my
you
an
me
jest
write
a
bit
of
a
circular
see
to
send
round
to
the
big
pots
of
the
collige
an
all
the
parents
of
the
young
fellers
as
we
can
get
the
addresses
of
see
even
amid
his
pangs
of
mortification
godwin
found
himself
pondering
an
intellectual
question
was
his
uncle
wholly
unconscious
of
the
misery
he
was
causing
had
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
public
proximity
of
an
uneducated
shopkeeping
relative
must
be
unwelcome
to
a
lad
who
was
distinguishing
himself
at
whitelaw
college
were
that
truly
the
case
then
it
would
be
unjust
to
regard
andrew
resentfully
destiny
alone
was
to
blame
and
after
all
the
man
might
be
so
absorbed
in
his
own
interest
so
strictly
confined
to
the
views
of
his
own
class
as
never
to
have
dreamt
of
the
sensibilities
he
wounded
in
fact
the
shame
excited
by
this
prospect
was
artificial
godwin
had
already
felt
that
it
was
unworthy
alike
of
a
philosopher
and
of
a
man
of
the
world
the
doubt
as
to
andrew
state
of
mind
and
this
moral
problem
had
a
restraining
effect
upon
the
young
man
temper
a
practical
person
justifies
himself
in
wrath
as
soon
as
his
judgment
is
at
one
with
that
of
the
multitude
godwin
though
his
passions
were
of
exceptional
force
must
needs
refine
debate
with
himself
points
of
abstract
justice
been
tellin

may
turn

godwin
looked
askance
at
his
cousin
who
stood
with

ready
for

he
asked

the
father
turned
round
with
an
expression
of
such
sincere
pride
that
godwin
for
all
his
loathing
was
obliged
to
smile
jest
sye
a

verses
of

into

filled
with

when
i

were
thus
massacred
and
the
reciter
stopped
with
the
sudden
jerk
of
a
machine

cried
the
father
exultantly
ai
no

what
he
towld
me
the
other
day
somethin
as
i
never
knew
and
should
never

of

we
was
talkin
about

but
you

right
as
soon
as
towld
eh
now

it
right
godwin
doubt
was
the
dry
answer
never
struck
me
murmured
mrs
peak
who
took
her
son
assent
seriously
and
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
preserve
an
obstinate
silence
ai
no
fool
ai
jowey
cried
the
parent
till
gits
to
collige
godwin
put
us
up
to
all
the
ins
and
outs
plenty
o
time
for
that
often
run
over
an
a
bit
o
dinner
and
no
need
to
talk
about
you
stay
in
twybridge
inquired
godwin
who
had
changed
in
look
and
manner
so
that
he
appeared
all
but
cheerful
we
on
our
is
jowey
an
me
jest
thought
we
break
the
journey
we
shall
ketch
the
hup
you
will
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
said
mrs
peak
surprised
at
godwin
transformation
but
seeing
that
hospitality
was
now
unavoidable
charlotte
presently
entered
the
house
and
after
a
private
conversation
with
her
mother
went
to
greet
andrew
if
only
to
signify
her
contempt
for
godwin
prejudices
charlotte
would
have
behaved
civilly
to
the
london
uncle
in
the
end
andrew
took
his
leave
in
the
friendliest
possible
way
repeating
often
that
he
would
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
mrs
peak
and
all
her
family
at
his
new
over
against
whitelaw
college
chapter
iv
immediately
upon
his
uncle
departure
godwin
disappeared
mrs
peak
caught
only
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
went
by
the
parlour
window
in
a
short
time
oliver
came
home
and
having
learned
what
had
happened
joined
his
mother
and
sister
in
a
dull
intermittent
conversation
on
the
subject
of
godwin
future
difficulties
wo
go
back
to
whitelaw
declared
the
lad
said
he
would
must
be
above
such
false
shame
was
charlotte
opinion
ca
see
that
it
will
make
the
slightest
difference
in
his
position
or
his
prospects
whereupon
her
mother
patience
gave
way
talk
such
nonsense
charlotte
you
understand
perfectly
well
how
serious
it
will
be
i
never
knew
anything
so
cruel
was
never
taught
persisted
the
girl
with
calm
obstinacy
one
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
one
relatives
just
because
they
are
in
a
humble
position
oliver
brought
the
tedious
discussion
to
an
end
by
clamouring
for
supper
the
table
was
laid
and
all
were
about
to
sit
down
when
godwin
presented
himself
to
the
general
astonishment
he
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
and
ate
more
heartily
than
usual
not
a
word
was
spoken
of
uncle
andrew
until
mrs
peak
and
her
elder
son
were
left
alone
together
then
godwin
remarked
in
a
tone
of
satisfied
decision
course
this
is
the
end
of
my
work
at
whitelaw
we
must
make
new
plans
mother
how
can
we
dear
what
will
lady
whitelaw
say
have
to
think
it
out
yet
in
a
day
or
two
i
shall
very
likely
write
a
letter
to
lady
whitelaw
there
no
need
you
know
to
go
talking
about
this
in
twybridge
just
leave
it
to
me
will
you
not
a
subject
i
care
to
talk
about
you
may
be
sure
but
i
do
hope
you
wo
do
anything
rash
godwin
i
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
not
at
all
sorry
to
leave
it
was
a
mistake
that
i
went
in
for
the
arts
course
greek
and
latin
and
so
on
you
know
i
ought
to
have
stuck
to
science
i
shall
go
back
to
it
now
do
be
afraid
i
make
a
position
for
myself
before
long
repay
all
you
have
spent
on
me
to
this
conclusion
had
he
come
the
process
of
mind
was
favoured
by
his
defeat
in
all
the
arts
subjects
in
that
direction
he
could
see
only
the
triumphant
chilvers
a
figure
which
disgusted
him
with
greeks
romans
and
all
the
ways
of
literature
as
to
his
future
efforts
he
was
by
no
means
clear
but
it
eased
him
greatly
to
have
cast
off
a
burden
of
doubt
his
theorising
intellect
loved
the
sensation
of
life
thrown
open
to
new
however
vague
possibilities
at
present
he
was
convinced
that
andrew
peak
had
done
him
a
service
in
this
there
was
an
indication
of
moral
cowardice
such
as
commonly
connects
itself
with
intense
pride
of
individuality
he
desired
to
shirk
the
combat
with
chilvers
and
welcomed
as
an
excuse
for
doing
so
the
shame
which
another
temper
would
have
stubbornly
defied
now
he
would
abandon
his
examination
a
clear
saving
of
money
presently
it
might
suit
him
to
take
the
instead
time
enough
to
think
of
that
had
he
but
pursued
the
science
course
from
the
first
who
at
whitelaw
could
have
come
out
ahead
of
him
he
had
wasted
a
couple
of
years
which
might
have
been
most
profitably
applied
by
this
time
he
might
have
been
ready
to
obtain
a
position
as
demonstrator
in
some
laboratory
on
his
way
perhaps
to
a
professorship
how
had
he
thus
been
led
astray
not
only
had
his
boyish
instincts
moved
strongly
towards
science
but
was
not
the
tendency
of
the
age
in
the
same
direction
buckland
warricombe
who
habitually
declaimed
against
classical
study
was
perfectly
right
the
world
had
learned
all
it
could
from
those
hoary
teachers
and
must
now
turn
to
nature
on
every
hand
the
future
was
with
students
of
the
laws
of
matter
often
it
was
true
he
had
been
tempted
by
the
thought
of
a
literary
career
he
had
written
in
verse
and
prose
but
with
small
success
an
attempt
to
compose
the
prize
poem
was
soon
abandoned
in
discouragement
the
essay
he
sent
in
had
not
been
mentioned
these
honours
had
fallen
to
earwaker
with
whom
it
was
not
easy
to
compete
on
such
ground
no
he
was
not
born
a
man
of
letters
but
in
science
granted
fair
opportunity
he
might
make
a
name
he
might
and
he
would
on
the
morrow
splendour
of
sunshine
drew
him
forth
to
some
distance
from
the
town
he
went
along
the
lanes
singing
now
it
was
holiday
with
him
and
for
the
first
time
he
could
enjoy
the
broad
golden
daylight
the
genial
warmth
in
a
hollow
of
grassy
fields
where
he
least
expected
to
encounter
an
acquaintance
it
was
his
chance
to
come
upon
christian
moxey
stretched
at
full
length
in
the
company
of
nibbling
sheep
since
the
dinner
at
moxey
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
christian
who
it
seemed
probable
was
back
at
his
work
in
rotherhithe
as
their
looks
met
both
laughed
wo
get
up
said
christian
effort
would
be
too
great
sit
down
and
let
us
have
a
talk
disturb
your
thoughts
answered
godwin
most
welcome
disturbance
they
were
very
pleasant
just
then
in
fact
i
have
come
as
far
as
this
in
the
hope
of
escaping
them
i
not
much
of
a
walker
are
you
yes
i
enjoy
a
good
walk
are
of
an
energetic
type
said
christian
musingly
will
do
something
in
life
when
do
you
go
up
for
honours
have
decided
not
to
go
in
at
all
i
sorry
to
hear
that
have
half
made
up
my
mind
not
to
return
to
whitelaw
observing
his
hearer
look
of
surprise
godwin
asked
himself
whether
it
signified
a
knowledge
of
his
footing
at
whitelaw
the
possibility
of
this
galled
him
but
it
was
such
a
great
step
to
have
declared
as
it
were
in
public
an
intention
of
freeing
himself
that
he
was
able
to
talk
on
with
something
of
aggressive
confidence
think
i
shall
go
in
for
some
practical
work
of
a
scientific
kind
it
was
a
mistake
for
me
to
pursue
the
arts
course
christian
looked
at
him
earnestly
you
sure
of
that
i
feel
sure
of
it
there
was
silence
christian
beat
the
ground
with
his
stick
state
of
mind
then
he
said
at
length
more
like
my
own
than
i
imagined
i
too
have
wavered
for
a
long
time
between
literature
and
science
and
now
at
last
i
have
quite
decided
quite
that
scientific
study
is
the
only
safe
line
for
me
the
fact
is
a
man
must
concentrate
himself
not
only
for
the
sake
of
practical
success
but
well
for
his
own
sake
he
spoke
lazily
dreamily
propped
upon
his
elbow
seeming
to
watch
the
sheep
which
panted
at
a
few
yards
from
him
have
no
right
he
pursued
with
a
shadow
of
kindly
anxiety
on
his
features
offer
you
advice
but
well
if
you
will
let
me
insist
on
what
i
have
learned
from
my
own
experience
there
nothing
like
having
a
special
line
of
work
and
sticking
to
it
vigorously
i
unfortunately
shall
never
do
anything
of
any
account
but
i
know
so
well
the
conflict
between
diverging
tastes
it
has
played
the
deuce
with
me
in
all
sorts
of
ways
at
zurich
i
utterly
wasted
my
time
and
i
done
no
better
since
i
came
back
to
england
do
think
me
presumptuous
i
only
mean
well
it
is
so
important
to
to
go
ahead
in
one
line
his
air
of
laughing
apology
was
very
pleasant
godwin
felt
his
heart
open
to
the
kind
fellow
one
needs
the
advice
more
than
i
he
replied
am
going
back
to
the
line
i
took
naturally
when
i
first
began
to
study
at
all
why
leave
whitelaw
asked
christian
gently
i
dislike
it
i
ca
tell
you
why
with
ready
tact
moxey
led
away
from
a
subject
which
he
saw
was
painful
course
there
are
many
other
places
where
one
can
study
just
as
well
you
know
anything
of
the
school
of
mines
in
london
godwin
inquired
abruptly
worked
there
myself
for
a
short
time
you
could
tell
me
about
the
the
fees
and
so
on
christian
readily
gave
the
desired
information
and
the
listener
mused
over
it
you
any
friends
in
london
moxey
asked
at
length
but
i
do
think
that
matters
i
shall
work
all
the
harder
so
said
the
other
with
some
hesitation
and
he
added
thoughtfully
depends
on
one
temperament
does
answer
to
be
too
much
alone
i
speak
for
myself
at
all
events
i
know
very
few
people
in
london
very
few
that
i
care
anything
about
that
in
fact
is
one
reason
why
i
am
staying
here
longer
than
i
intended
he
seemed
to
speak
rather
to
himself
than
to
godwin
the
on
his
lips
expressed
a
wish
to
disclose
circumstances
and
motives
which
were
yet
hardly
a
suitable
topic
in
a
dialogue
such
as
this
like
the
atmosphere
of
a
of
a
comfortable
home
no
doubt
i
should
get
on
better
with
things
in
general
if
i
had
a
home
of
my
own
i
live
in
lodgings
you
know
my
sister
lives
with
friends
of
course
one
has
a
sense
of
freedom
but
then
his
voice
murmured
off
into
silence
and
again
he
beat
the
ground
with
his
cane
godwin
was
strongly
interested
in
this
broken
revelation
he
found
it
difficult
to
understand
moxey
yearning
for
domesticity
all
his
own
impulses
leading
towards
quite
a
contrary
ideal
to
him
life
in
london
lodgings
made
rich
promise
that
indeed
would
be
freedom
and
full
of
all
manner
of
high
possibilities
each
communed
with
his
thoughts
happening
to
glance
at
christian
godwin
was
struck
with
the
graceful
attitude
in
which
the
young
man
reclined
he
himself
squatted
awkwardly
on
the
grass
unable
to
abandon
himself
in
natural
repose
even
as
he
found
it
impossible
to
talk
with
the
ease
of
unconsciousness
the
contrast
too
between
his
garments
his
boots
and
those
of
the
londoner
was
painful
enough
to
him
without
being
a
dandy
christian
it
was
evident
gave
a
good
deal
of
thought
to
costume
that
kind
of
thing
had
always
excited
godwin
contempt
but
now
he
confessed
himself
envious
doubtless
to
be
well
dressed
was
a
great
step
towards
the
finished
ease
of
what
is
called
a
gentlemanly
demeanour
which
he
knew
he
was
very
far
from
having
attained
exclaimed
christian
unexpectedly
i
can
be
of
ever
so
little
use
to
you
pray
let
me
i
must
get
back
to
town
in
a
few
days
but
you
know
my
address
write
to
me
i
beg
if
you
wish
for
any
more
information
the
talk
turned
to
less
difficult
topics
godwin
made
inquiries
about
zurich
then
about
switzerland
in
general
you
see
much
of
the
alps
as
a
climber
sees
them
that
sort
of
thing
is
in
my
way
i
have
the
energy
more
the
pity
would
you
like
to
see
a
lot
of
good
photographs
i
brought
back
i
have
them
here
brought
them
to
show
the
girls
in
spite
of
the
five
miss
moxeys
and
christian
sister
peak
accepted
the
invitation
to
walk
back
with
his
companion
and
presently
they
began
to
stroll
towards
twybridge
have
an
absurd
tendency
to
dream
to
lose
myself
amid
ideals
i
do
quite
know
how
to
express
it
christian
resumed
when
both
had
been
silent
for
some
minutes
why
i
mean
to
go
in
earnestly
for
science
as
a
corrective
fortunately
i
have
to
work
for
my
living
otherwise
i
should
moon
my
life
away
no
doubt
my
sister
has
ten
times
as
much
energy
she
knows
much
more
than
i
do
already
what
a
splendid
thing
it
is
to
be
of
an
independent
character
i
had
rather
be
a
than
a
millionaire
of
uncertain
will
my
uncle
there
a
man
who
knows
his
own
mind
i
respect
those
strong
practical
natures
do
be
misled
by
ideals
make
the
most
of
your
circumstances
do
aim
at
but
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
know
what
right
i
have
to
lecture
you
in
this
way
and
he
broke
off
with
his
pleasant
laugh
colouring
a
little
they
reached
moxey
house
in
a
garden
chair
on
the
lawn
sat
miss
janet
occupied
with
a
book
she
rose
to
meet
them
shook
hands
with
godwin
and
said
to
her
cousin
postman
has
just
left
a
letter
for
you
forwarded
from
london
i
going
to
show
mr
peak
my
swiss
photographs
you
care
to
come
and
help
me
in
the
toil
of
turning
them
over
lazy
man
her
laugh
was
joyous
any
one
less
prejudiced
than
peak
would
have
recognised
the
beauty
which
transformed
her
homely
features
as
she
met
christian
look
on
the
hall
table
lay
the
letter
of
which
janet
had
spoken
christian
took
it
up
and
godwin
happening
at
that
moment
to
observe
him
caught
the
tremor
of
a
sudden
emotion
on
lip
and
eyelid
instantly
prompted
by
he
knew
not
what
perception
he
turned
his
gaze
to
janet
and
in
time
to
see
that
she
also
was
aware
of
her
cousin
strong
interest
in
the
letter
which
was
at
once
put
away
in
christian
pocket
they
passed
into
the
where
a
large
portfolio
stood
against
the
back
of
a
chair
the
which
ensued
was
to
godwin
a
time
of
uneasiness
his
pleasure
in
the
photographs
suffered
disturbance
from
a
subtle
stress
on
his
nerves
due
to
something
indeterminable
in
the
situation
of
which
he
formed
a
part
merry
humour
seemed
to
be
subdued
christian
was
obviously
forcing
himself
to
entertain
the
guest
whilst
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
as
soon
as
possible
godwin
rose
to
depart
he
was
just
saying
to
janet
when
marcella
entered
the
room
she
stood
still
and
christian
said
hurriedly
possible
marcella
that
mr
peak
will
be
coming
to
london
before
long
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
there
will
be
glad
i
sure
answered
his
sister
then
as
if
forcing
herself
to
address
peak
directly
she
faced
to
him
and
added
easy
to
find
sympathetic
companions
at
all
events
have
found
very
many
godwin
replied
meaning
to
speak
in
a
tone
only
but
conscious
at
once
that
he
had
made
what
might
seem
an
appeal
for
sympathy
thereupon
his
pride
revolted
and
in
a
moment
drove
him
from
the
room
christian
followed
and
at
the
front
door
shook
hands
with
him
nervous
impatience
was
unmistakable
in
the
young
man
look
and
words
again
godwin
speculated
on
the
meaning
of
this
and
wondered
in
connection
therewith
what
were
the
characteristics
which
marcella
moxey
looked
for
in
a
companion
chapter
v
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
godwin
sat
down
to
pen
the
rough
draft
of
a
letter
to
lady
whitelaw
when
the
first
difficulties
were
surmounted
he
wrote
rapidly
and
at
considerable
length
it
was
not
easy
at
his
time
of
life
to
compress
into
the
limits
of
an
ordinary
epistle
all
he
wished
to
say
to
the
widow
of
his
benefactor
his
purpose
was
with
all
possible
respect
yet
as
firmly
as
might
be
to
inform
lady
whitelaw
that
he
could
not
spend
the
last
of
his
proposed
three
years
at
the
college
in
kingsmill
and
furthermore
to
request
of
her
that
she
would
permit
his
using
the
promised
sum
of
money
as
a
student
at
the
royal
school
of
mines
this
had
to
be
done
without
confession
of
the
reasons
for
his
change
of
plan
he
could
not
even
hint
at
them
yet
cause
must
be
assigned
and
the
best
form
of
words
he
could
excogitate
ran
thus
circumstances
render
it
desirable
almost
necessary
that
i
should
spend
the
next
twelve
months
in
london
in
spite
of
sincere
reluctance
to
leave
whitelaw
college
i
am
compelled
to
take
this
step
the
lady
must
interpret
that
as
best
she
might
very
hard
indeed
was
the
task
of
begging
a
continuance
of
her
bounty
under
these
changed
conditions
could
he
but
have
resigned
the
money
all
had
been
well
his
tone
might
then
have
been
dignified
without
effort
but
such
disinterestedness
he
could
not
afford
his
mother
might
grant
him
money
enough
barely
to
live
upon
until
he
discovered
means
of
support
for
his
education
she
was
unable
to
pay
after
more
than
an
hour
work
he
had
moderately
satisfied
himself
indeed
several
portions
of
the
letter
struck
him
as
well
composed
and
he
felt
that
they
must
heighten
the
reader
interest
in
him
with
an
author
pleasure
though
at
the
same
time
with
much
uneasiness
he
perused
the
appeal
again
and
again
late
in
the
evening
when
he
was
alone
with
his
mother
he
told
her
what
he
had
done
and
read
the
letter
for
her
opinion
mrs
peak
was
gravely
troubled
whitelaw
will
ask
her
sisters
for
an
explanation
she
said
have
thought
of
that
godwin
replied
with
the
confident
cheerful
air
he
had
assumed
from
the
first
the
miss
lumbs
go
to
aunt
she
must
be
prepared
to
put
them
off
in
some
way
but
look
here
mother
when
uncle
has
opened
his
shop
it
pretty
certain
that
some
one
or
other
will
hit
on
the
true
explanation
of
my
disappearance
let
them
then
lady
whitelaw
will
understand
and
forgive
me
after
much
musing
the
mother
ventured
a
timid
question
the
result
of
her
anxieties
rather
than
of
her
judgment
on
the
point
at
issue
dear
are
you
quite
sure
that
his
shop
would
make
so
much
difference
the
young
man
gave
a
passionate
start
to
have
the
fellows
going
there
to
eat
and
hearing
his
talk
and
not
for
a
day
could
i
bear
it
not
for
an
hour
he
was
red
with
anticipated
shame
and
his
voice
shook
with
indignation
at
the
suggested
martyrdom
mrs
peak
dried
a
tear
would
be
so
alone
in
london
godwin
a
bit
of
it
young
moxey
will
be
a
useful
friend
i
am
convinced
he
will
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
aim
at
getting
a
place
at
the
works
in
rotherhithe
where
he
no
doubt
has
influence
you
see
mother
i
might
manage
it
even
before
the
end
of
the
year
our
moxey
will
be
disposed
to
help
me
with
his
recommendation
my
dear
would
it
come
to
the
same
thing
then
if
you
went
back
to
mr
moxey
he
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
no
no
i
could
live
at
twybridge
i
have
my
way
to
make
mother
and
the
place
for
that
is
london
you
know
i
am
ambitious
trust
me
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
the
result
i
depend
upon
your
help
in
this
whole
affair
do
refuse
it
me
i
have
done
with
whitelaw
and
i
have
done
with
twybridge
now
comes
london
you
ca
regard
me
as
a
boy
you
know
but
me
no
buts
he
cried
laughing
excitedly
thing
is
settled
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
morning
i
post
this
letter
i
feel
it
will
be
successful
see
aunt
and
get
her
support
mind
that
charlotte
and
oliver
do
talk
to
people
if
you
all
use
discretion
there
no
need
for
any
curiosity
to
be
excited
when
godwin
had
taken
a
resolve
there
was
no
domestic
influence
strong
enough
to
prevent
his
acting
upon
it
mrs
peak
ignorance
of
the
world
her
mild
passivity
and
the
faith
she
had
in
her
intellectual
resources
made
her
useless
as
a
counsellor
and
from
no
one
else
now
that
gunnery
was
dead
would
the
young
man
have
dreamt
of
seeking
guidance
whatever
lady
whitelaw
reply
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
london
should
his
subsidy
be
refused
then
he
would
live
on
what
his
mother
could
allow
him
until
probably
with
the
aid
of
christian
moxey
he
might
obtain
a
salaried
position
the
letter
was
despatched
and
with
feverish
impatience
he
awaited
a
reply
nine
days
passed
and
he
heard
nothing
half
that
delay
sufficed
to
bring
out
all
the
capacities
of
a
nature
such
as
his
to
his
mother
conjectural
explanations
he
could
lend
no
ear
doubtless
lady
whitelaw
against
whom
for
subtle
reasons
he
was
already
prejudiced
had
taken
offence
either
she
would
not
reply
at
all
or
presently
there
would
come
a
few
lines
of
polite
displeasure
intimating
her
disinclination
to
aid
his
project
he
silently
raged
against
woman
her
neglect
was
insolence
had
she
not
delicacy
enough
to
divine
the
anxiety
natural
to
one
in
his
dependent
position
did
she
take
him
for
an
writer
of
mendicant
appeals
his
pride
fed
upon
the
outrage
and
became
fierce
then
arrived
a
small
glossy
envelope
containing
a
tiny
sheet
of
very
thick
whereon
it
was
written
that
lady
whitelaw
regretted
her
tardiness
in
replying
to
him
caused
by
her
absence
from
home
and
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
call
upon
her
at
ten
next
morning
at
the
house
of
her
sisters
the
misses
lumb
where
she
was
stopping
for
a
day
she
remained
his
sincerely
having
duly
contorted
this
note
into
all
manner
of
painful
meanings
godwin
occupied
an
hour
in
making
himself
presentable
scornful
that
he
should
deem
such
trouble
necessary
and
with
furiously
beating
heart
set
out
to
walk
through
twybridge
arrived
at
the
house
he
was
led
by
a
servant
into
the
front
room
on
the
ground
floor
where
lady
whitelaw
alone
sat
reading
a
newspaper
her
features
were
of
a
very
common
order
and
nothing
distinguished
her
from
women
of
average
refinement
she
had
chubby
hands
rather
broad
shoulders
and
no
visible
waist
the
scrutiny
she
bestowed
upon
her
visitor
was
close
to
godwin
feelings
it
too
much
resembled
that
with
which
she
would
have
received
an
applicant
for
the
post
of
footman
yet
her
smile
was
friendly
enough
and
no
lack
of
civility
appeared
in
the
repetition
of
her
excuses
for
having
replied
so
late
us
talk
about
this
she
began
when
godwin
was
uneasily
seated
she
spoke
with
an
excess
of
precision
as
though
it
had
at
one
time
been
needful
for
her
to
premeditate
polished
phrases
am
very
sorry
you
should
have
to
think
of
quitting
the
college
very
sorry
indeed
you
are
one
of
the
students
who
do
honour
to
the
institution
this
was
pleasant
and
godwin
felt
a
regret
of
the
constraint
that
was
upon
him
in
his
endeavour
not
to
display
a
purring
smile
he
looked
grim
as
if
the
compliment
were
beneath
his
notice
do
think
she
pursued
i
wish
you
to
speak
more
fully
about
the
private
circumstances
you
refer
to
in
your
letter
but
do
let
me
ask
you
is
your
decision
final
are
you
sure
that
when
the
vacations
are
over
you
will
see
things
just
as
you
do
now
am
quite
sure
of
it
he
replied
the
emphasis
was
merely
natural
to
him
he
could
not
so
govern
his
voice
as
to
convey
the
respectful
regret
which
at
this
moment
he
felt
a
younger
lady
one
who
had
heightened
the
charm
of
her
compliment
with
subtle
harmony
of
tones
and
strongly
feminine
gaze
would
perhaps
have
elicited
from
him
a
free
confession
gratitude
and
admiration
would
have
made
him
capable
of
such
frankness
but
in
the
face
of
this
woman
yes
he
had
unaccountably
felt
it
jar
upon
him
that
a
lady
should
be
reading
a
newspaper
under
her
matronly
smile
he
could
do
no
more
than
plump
out
his
sure
to
lady
whitelaw
it
sounded
altogether
too
curt
she
was
conscious
of
her
position
as
patroness
and
had
in
fact
thought
it
likely
that
the
young
man
would
be
disposed
to
gratify
her
curiosity
in
some
measure
can
only
say
that
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
fell
from
her
tightened
lips
after
a
moment
pause
instantly
godwin
pride
expelled
the
softer
emotion
he
pressed
hard
with
his
feet
upon
the
floor
every
nerve
in
his
body
tense
with
that
distressing
passion
peculiar
to
the
shyly
arrogant
regard
him
and
you
had
imagined
he
was
submitting
to
rebuke
for
an
offence
he
could
not
deny
lady
whitelaw
waited
a
minute
almost
and
peak
gave
no
sign
of
opening
his
mouth
is
certainly
much
to
be
regretted
she
said
at
length
coolly
course
i
do
know
what
prospects
you
may
have
in
london
but
if
you
had
remained
at
the
college
something
advantageous
would
no
doubt
have
offered
before
long
there
went
small
tact
to
the
wording
of
this
admonition
impossible
for
lady
whitelaw
to
understand
the
complexities
of
a
character
such
as
godwin
even
had
she
enjoyed
opportunities
of
studying
it
but
many
a
woman
of
the
world
would
have
directed
herself
more
cautiously
after
reading
that
letter
of
his
peak
impulse
was
to
thank
her
for
the
past
and
declare
that
henceforth
he
would
dispense
with
aid
only
the
choking
in
his
throat
obstructed
some
such
utterance
he
resented
profoundly
her
supposition
natural
enough
that
his
chief
aim
was
to
establish
himself
in
a
career
what
am
i
to
be
grateful
for
a
mere
chance
of
earning
my
living
have
i
not
shown
that
i
am
capable
of
something
more
than
the
ordinary
lot
in
life
from
the
heights
of
her
assured
independence
does
she
look
down
upon
me
as
a
young
man
seeking
a
he
was
filled
with
wrath
and
all
because
a
good
commonplace
woman
could
not
divine
that
he
dreamt
of
european
fame
am
very
sorry
that
i
ca
take
that
into
account
he
managed
to
say
wish
to
give
this
next
year
exclusively
to
scientific
study
and
after
that
i
shall
see
what
course
is
open
to
me
he
was
not
of
the
men
who
can
benefit
by
patronage
and
be
simply
grateful
for
it
his
position
was
a
false
one
to
be
begging
with
awkward
show
of
thankfulness
for
a
benefaction
which
in
his
heart
he
detested
he
knew
himself
for
an
undesigning
hypocrite
and
felt
that
he
might
as
well
have
been
a
rascal
complete
gratitude
no
man
capable
of
it
in
fuller
measure
than
he
but
not
to
such
persons
as
lady
whitelaw
before
old
sir
job
he
could
more
easily
have
bowed
himself
but
this
woman
represented
the
superiority
of
mere
brute
wealth
against
which
his
soul
rebelled
there
was
another
disagreeable
silence
during
which
lady
whitelaw
commented
on
her
protege
very
much
as
warricombe
had
done
you
allow
me
to
ask
she
said
at
length
with
cold
politeness
you
have
acquaintances
in
london
i
know
some
one
who
studied
at
the
school
of
mines
mr
peak
i
see
that
your
mind
is
made
up
and
no
doubt
you
are
the
best
judge
of
your
private
circumstances
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
think
over
the
matter
for
a
day
or
two
i
will
write
to
you
i
to
you
thought
godwin
a
resolve
which
enabled
him
to
rise
with
something
like
a
conventional
smile
and
thus
put
an
end
to
a
very
brief
and
quite
unsatisfactory
interview
he
strode
homewards
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
his
own
behaviour
had
been
wretchedly
clownish
he
was
only
too
well
aware
of
that
he
ought
to
have
put
aside
all
the
grosser
aspects
of
his
case
and
have
exhibited
the
purely
intellectual
motives
which
made
such
a
change
as
he
purposed
seem
desirable
to
him
that
would
have
been
to
act
with
dignity
that
would
have
been
the
very
best
form
of
gratitude
for
the
kindness
he
had
received
but
no
his
accursed
lack
of
had
ruined
all
woman
was
now
offended
in
good
earnest
he
saw
it
in
her
face
at
parting
the
fault
was
admittedly
on
his
side
but
what
right
had
she
to
talk
about
advantageous
she
would
write
to
him
to
be
sure
that
meant
she
could
not
yet
make
up
her
mind
whether
to
grant
the
money
or
not
pluto
take
the
money
long
before
sitting
down
to
her
glossy
she
should
have
received
a
letter
from
composed
already
now
he
was
up
in
the
garret
bedroom
scribbling
as
fast
as
pen
could
fly
over
paper
he
had
been
guilty
of
a
mistake
so
ran
the
epistle
having
decided
to
leave
whitelaw
he
ought
never
to
have
requested
a
continuance
of
the
pension
he
begged
lady
whitelaw
would
forgive
this
thoughtless
impropriety
she
had
made
him
understand
the
full
extent
of
his
error
of
course
he
could
not
accept
anything
more
from
her
as
for
the
past
it
would
be
idle
for
him
to
attempt
an
expression
of
his
indebtedness
but
for
sir
job
munificence
he
must
now
have
been
struggling
to
complete
a
radically
imperfect
education
of
going
into
the
world
to
make
a
place
for
myself
among
the
scientific
investigators
of
our
time
one
claims
to
respectful
treatment
must
be
put
forward
unmistakably
especially
in
dealing
with
such
people
as
lady
whitelaw
now
perhaps
she
would
understand
what
his
reserve
concealed
the
satisfaction
of
declining
further
assistance
was
enormous
he
read
his
letter
several
times
aloud
this
was
the
great
style
he
could
imagine
this
incident
forming
a
landmark
in
the
biography
of
a
notable
man
now
for
a
fair
copy
and
in
a
hand
mind
you
that
gave
no
hint
of
his
care
for
caligraphic
seemliness
bold
forthright
the
letter
in
his
pocket
he
went
downstairs
his
mother
had
been
out
all
the
morning
now
she
was
just
returned
and
godwin
saw
trouble
on
her
forehead
anxiously
she
inquired
concerning
the
result
of
his
interview
now
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
intelligible
report
of
what
had
happened
godwin
found
his
tongue
falter
how
could
he
convey
to
another
the
intangible
sense
of
wounded
dignity
which
had
impelled
his
pen
instead
of
producing
the
letter
with
a
flourish
he
answered
with
affected
carelessness
am
to
hear
in
a
day
or
two
she
seem
to
take
it
in
the
right
way
evidently
thinks
of
me
too
much
as
a
schoolboy
and
he
began
to
pace
the
room
mrs
peak
sat
still
with
an
air
of
anxious
brooding
do
think
she
will
refuse
godwin
fell
from
her
presently
his
hand
closed
on
the
letter
well
in
that
case
i
should
go
to
london
and
find
some
occupation
as
soon
as
possible
you
could
still
let
me
have
the
same
money
as
before
it
was
said
absently
and
did
not
satisfy
godwin
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
it
appeared
that
mrs
peak
had
that
morning
been
to
see
the
legal
friend
who
looked
after
her
small
concerns
and
though
she
would
not
admit
that
she
had
any
special
cause
for
uneasiness
her
son
recalled
similar
occasions
when
an
interview
with
dutch
had
been
followed
by
several
days
gloom
the
truth
was
that
mrs
peak
could
not
live
strictly
within
the
income
at
her
disposal
and
on
being
from
time
to
time
reminded
of
this
she
was
oppressed
by
passing
worry
if
godwin
and
oliver
on
well
things
would
come
all
right
in
the
end
but
in
the
meantime
she
could
not
face
additional
expenditure
godwin
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
the
razor
edge
on
which
the
affairs
of
the
household
were
balanced
at
present
it
brought
about
a
very
sudden
change
in
his
state
of
mind
he
went
upstairs
again
and
sat
with
the
letter
before
him
sunk
in
misery
the
reaction
had
given
him
a
headache
a
fortnight
and
no
word
from
lady
whitelaw
but
neither
was
letter
posted
was
he
at
liberty
to
indulge
the
which
urged
him
to
write
in
a
moment
of
heated
confidence
it
was
all
very
well
to
talk
of
some
occupation
in
london
but
he
knew
that
this
might
prove
no
easy
matter
a
year
work
at
the
school
of
mines
would
decidedly
facilitate
his
endeavour
and
seeing
that
his
mother
peace
depended
upon
his
being
speedily
was
it
not
a
form
of
selfishness
to
reject
help
from
one
who
could
well
afford
it
from
a
distance
he
regarded
lady
whitelaw
with
more
charity
a
longer
talk
with
her
might
have
led
to
better
mutual
apprehension
and
after
all
it
was
not
she
but
her
husband
to
whom
he
would
stand
indebted
sir
job
was
a
very
old
fellow
he
had
meant
thoroughly
well
why
clearly
the
bestower
of
this
third
year
allowance
would
not
be
lady
whitelaw
at
all
if
it
were
granted
godwin
began
to
suffer
a
troublesome
misgiving
perchance
he
had
gone
too
far
and
was
now
in
fact
abandoned
to
his
own
resources
three
weeks
then
came
the
expected
letter
and
as
he
opened
it
his
heart
leaped
at
the
sight
of
a
cheque
talisman
of
unrivalled
power
over
the
emotions
of
the
moneyless
lady
whitelaw
wrote
briefly
and
formally
having
considered
godwin
request
she
had
no
reason
for
doubting
that
he
would
make
a
good
use
of
the
proposed
year
at
the
school
of
mines
and
accordingly
she
sent
him
the
sum
which
sir
job
had
intended
for
his
final
session
at
whitelaw
college
she
wished
him
all
benefit
from
his
studies
and
prosperity
henceforth
rejoicing
though
godwin
exhibited
this
remittance
to
his
mother
from
whom
it
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
forthwith
he
sat
down
to
write
quite
a
different
letter
from
that
which
still
lay
in
his
private
drawer
a
letter
which
he
strove
to
make
the
justification
to
his
own
mind
of
this
descent
to
humility
at
considerable
length
he
dwelt
upon
the
change
of
tastes
of
which
he
had
been
conscious
lately
and
did
not
fail
to
make
obvious
the
superiority
of
his
ambition
to
all
thought
of
material
advancement
he
offered
his
thanks
and
promised
to
give
an
account
of
himself
as
in
duty
bound
at
the
close
of
the
twelvemonths
study
he
was
about
to
undertake
a
letter
in
which
the
discerning
would
have
read
much
sincerity
and
some
pathos
after
all
not
a
letter
to
be
ashamed
of
lady
whitelaw
would
not
understand
it
but
then
how
many
people
are
capable
of
even
faintly
apprehending
the
phenomena
of
mental
growth
and
now
to
plan
seriously
his
mode
of
life
in
london
with
christian
moxey
he
was
so
slightly
acquainted
that
it
was
impossible
to
seek
his
advice
with
regard
to
lodgings
besides
the
lodgings
must
be
of
a
character
far
too
modest
to
come
within
moxey
sphere
of
observation
other
acquaintance
he
had
none
in
the
capital
so
it
was
clear
that
he
must
enter
boldly
upon
the
unknown
world
and
find
a
home
for
himself
as
best
he
might
mrs
peak
could
offer
suggestions
as
to
likely
localities
and
this
was
of
course
useful
help
in
the
meantime
for
it
would
be
waste
of
money
to
go
up
till
near
the
end
of
the
holiday
season
he
made
schemes
of
study
and
completed
his
information
concerning
the
school
of
mines
so
far
from
lamenting
the
interruption
of
his
promising
career
at
whitelaw
he
persuaded
himself
that
uncle
andrew
had
in
truth
done
him
a
very
good
turn
now
at
length
he
was
fixed
in
the
right
course
the
only
thing
he
regretted
was
losing
sight
of
his
two
or
three
especially
earwaker
and
buckland
warricombe
they
to
be
sure
would
soon
guess
the
reason
of
his
disappearance
would
they
join
in
the
laughter
certain
to
be
excited
by
dining
and
refreshment
rooms
probably
how
could
they
help
it
earwaker
might
be
superior
to
a
prejudice
of
that
kind
his
own
connections
were
of
humble
standing
but
warricombe
must
wince
and
shrug
his
shoulders
perhaps
even
some
of
the
professors
would
have
their
attention
directed
to
the
ludicrous
mishap
they
were
gentlemen
and
even
though
they
smiled
must
certainly
sympathise
with
him
wait
a
little
whitelaw
college
should
yet
remember
the
student
who
seemed
to
have
vanished
amid
the
world
obscure
tumult
resolved
that
he
was
about
to
turn
his
back
on
twybridge
for
ever
he
found
the
conditions
of
life
there
quite
supportable
through
this
last
month
or
two
the
family
reaped
benefit
from
his
improved
temper
even
to
cusse
he
behaved
with
modified
contempt
oliver
was
judicious
enough
to
suppress
his
nigger
minstrelsy
and
kindred
demonstrations
of
spirit
in
his
brother
presence
and
charlotte
though
steadily
resentful
did
her
best
to
avoid
conflict
through
the
misses
lumb
godwin
change
of
purpose
had
of
course
become
known
to
his
aunt
who
for
a
time
took
it
ill
that
these
debates
had
been
concealed
from
her
when
mrs
peak
in
confidence
apprised
her
of
the
disturbing
cause
miss
cadman
indignation
knew
no
bounds
what
that
low
fellow
had
been
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
progress
of
godwin
peak
education
and
not
a
protest
uttered
he
should
have
been
to
establish
himself
in
kingsmill
why
had
they
not
taken
into
council
she
would
have
faced
the
man
and
have
overawed
him
he
should
have
been
made
to
understand
the
gross
selfishness
of
his
behaviour
never
had
she
heard
of
such
a
monstrous
case
godwin
spent
much
time
in
quiet
examination
of
the
cabinets
bequeathed
to
him
by
gunnery
he
used
a
pound
or
two
of
lady
whitelaw
money
for
the
purchase
of
scientific
books
and
set
to
work
upon
them
with
freshened
zeal
the
early
morning
and
late
evening
were
given
to
country
walks
from
which
he
always
returned
with
brain
excited
by
the
forecast
of
great
achievements
when
the
time
of
his
departure
approached
he
decided
to
pay
a
farewell
visit
to
moxey
he
chose
an
hour
when
the
family
would
probably
be
taking
their
ease
in
the
garden
three
of
the
ladies
were
in
fact
amusing
themselves
with
croquet
while
their
father
pipe
in
mouth
bent
over
a
bed
of
calceolarias
this
that
i
hear
exclaimed
moxey
as
he
shook
hands
are
not
going
back
to
whitelaw
the
story
had
of
course
spread
among
all
twybridge
people
who
knew
anything
of
the
peaks
and
it
was
generally
felt
that
some
mystery
was
involved
godwin
had
reasonably
feared
that
his
obligations
to
sir
job
whitelaw
must
become
known
impossible
for
such
a
matter
to
be
kept
secret
all
who
took
any
interest
in
the
young
man
had
long
been
privately
acquainted
with
the
facts
of
his
position
now
that
discussion
was
rife
it
would
have
been
prudent
in
the
misses
lumb
to
divulge
as
much
of
the
truth
at
they
knew
but
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
natural
perversity
they
maintained
a
provoking
silence
hence
whispers
and
suspicious
questions
all
wide
of
the
mark
no
one
had
as
yet
heard
of
andrew
peak
and
it
seemed
but
too
likely
that
lady
whitelaw
for
some
good
reason
had
declined
to
discharge
the
expenses
of
godwin
last
year
at
the
college
moxey
himself
felt
that
an
explanation
was
desirable
but
he
listened
with
his
usual
friendly
air
to
godwin
account
of
the
matter
which
of
course
included
no
mention
of
lady
whitelaw
you
friends
in
london
he
inquired
like
everyone
else
except
that
your
nephew
was
so
kind
as
to
ask
me
to
call
on
him
if
ever
i
happened
to
be
there
there
passed
over
moxey
countenance
a
curious
shadow
godwin
noticed
it
and
at
once
concluded
that
the
manufacturer
condemned
christian
for
undue
advances
to
one
below
his
own
station
the
result
of
this
surmise
was
of
course
a
sudden
coldness
on
godwin
part
increased
when
he
found
that
moxey
turned
to
another
subject
without
a
word
about
his
nephew
in
less
than
ten
minutes
he
offered
to
take
leave
and
no
one
urged
him
to
stay
longer
moxey
made
sober
expression
of
good
wishes
and
hoped
he
might
hear
that
the
removal
to
london
had
proved
this
word
sufficed
to
convert
godwin
irritation
into
wrath
he
said
an
abrupt
raised
his
hat
as
awkwardly
as
usual
and
stalked
away
a
few
paces
from
the
garden
gate
he
encountered
miss
janet
moxey
just
coming
home
from
walk
or
visit
another
grab
at
his
hat
and
he
would
have
passed
without
a
word
but
the
girl
stopped
him
hear
that
you
are
going
to
london
mr
peak
i
am
miss
moxey
she
examined
his
face
and
seemed
to
hesitate
you
have
just
been
to
say
to
father
janet
paused
looked
away
again
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
have
friends
there
i
hope
she
ventured
i
have
none
cousin
christian
you
remember
would
i
am
sure
be
very
glad
to
help
you
in
any
way
her
voice
sank
and
at
the
same
time
she
coloured
just
perceptibly
under
godwin
gaze
he
assured
me
was
the
reply
i
must
learn
to
be
independent
miss
moxey
whereupon
godwin
performed
a
salute
and
marched
forward
his
boxes
were
packed
and
now
he
had
but
one
more
evening
in
the
old
home
it
was
made
less
pleasant
than
it
might
have
been
by
a
piece
of
information
upon
which
he
by
chance
alighted
in
a
newspaper
the
result
of
the
honours
examination
for
the
first
at
london
had
just
been
made
known
and
in
two
subjects
a
high
place
was
assigned
to
bruno
leathwaite
chilvers
not
the
first
place
happily
but
it
was
disagreeable
enough
pooh
what
matter
what
are
academic
successes
ten
years
hence
which
name
would
have
wider
recognition
bruno
chilvers
or
godwin
peak
he
laughed
with
scornful
superiority
no
one
was
to
accompany
him
to
the
station
on
that
he
insisted
he
had
decided
for
as
early
a
train
as
possible
that
the
dolours
of
might
be
abridged
at
a
quarter
to
eight
the
cab
drove
up
to
the
door
out
with
the
trunks
labelled
care
of
the
cabinets
were
his
last
words
to
his
mother
may
want
to
have
them
sent
before
long
he
implied
what
he
had
not
ventured
to
say
plainly
that
he
was
leaving
twybridge
for
good
and
henceforth
would
not
think
of
it
as
home
in
these
moments
of
parting
he
resented
the
natural
feeling
which
brought
moisture
to
his
eyes
he
hardened
himself
against
the
ties
of
blood
and
kept
repeating
to
himself
a
phrase
in
which
of
late
he
had
summed
his
miseries
was
born
in
exile
born
in
exile
now
at
length
had
he
set
forth
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
end
perchance
in
some
unknown
land
among
his
spiritual
kith
and
kin

ii
chapter
i
in
the
spring
of
jarvis
runcorn
editor
and
of
the
london
was
looking
about
for
a
young
man
of
journalistic
promise
whom
he
might
associate
with
himself
in
the
conduct
of
that
long
established
radical
paper
the
tale
of
his
years
warned
him
that
he
could
not
hope
to
support
much
longer
a
burden
which
necessarily
increased
with
the
growing
range
and
complexity
of
public
affairs
hitherto
he
had
been
the
autocrat
of
the
office
but
competing
sunday
papers
exacted
an
alertness
a
versatile
vigour
such
as
only
youth
can
supply
for
there
was
felt
to
be
a
danger
that
the
might
lose
its
prestige
in
democratic
journalism
thus
on
the
watch
runcorn
a
wary
man
of

who
had
gone
through
many

reached
that
of
weekly
literature
took
counsel
one
day
with
a
malkin
by
name
who
owned
two
or
three
country
newspapers
and
had
reaped
from
them
a
considerable
fortune
in
consequence
his
attention
was
directed
to
one
john
earwaker
then
editing
the
malkin
eldest
son
had
recently
stood
as
liberal
candidate
for
wattleborough
and
though
defeated
was
loud
in
his
praise
of
the
with
its
editor
he
had
come
to
be
on
terms
of
intimate
friendship
earwaker
was
well
acquainted
with
journalistic
life
in
the
provinces
he
sprang
from
a
humble
family
living
at
kingsmill
had
studied
at
whitelaw
college
and
was
now
but
the
style
of
his
seemed
to
mark
him
for
a
wider
sphere
of
work
it
was
decided
to
invite
him
to
london
and
the
young
man
readily
accepted
runcorn
proposals
a
few
months
later
he
exchanged
temporary
lodgings
for
chambers
in
staple
inn
where
he
surrounded
himself
with
plain
furniture
and
many
books
in
personal
appearance
he
had
changed
a
good
deal
since
that
at
whitelaw
when
his
success
as
versifier
and
essayist
foretold
a
literary
career
his
figure
was
no
longer
ungainly
the
big
head
seemed
to
fit
better
upon
the
narrow
shoulders
he
neither
walked
with
extravagant
paces
nor
waved
his
arms
like
a
windmill
a
sufficiency
of
good
food
and
the
habit
of
intercourse
with
active
men
had
given
him
an
aspect
perhaps
the
sole
peculiarity
he
retained
from
student
times
was
his
hollow
chuckle
of
mirth
a
laugh
which
struggled
vainly
for
enlargement
he
dressed
with
conventional
decency
even
submitting
to
the
hat
his
features
betrayed
connection
with
a
physically
coarse
stock
but
to
converse
with
him
was
to
discover
the
man
of
original
vigour
and
wide
intellectual
scope
with
ordinary
companions
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
him
to
speak
of
his
professional
interests
but
for
his
position
on
weekly
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
surmise
how
he
stood
with
regard
to
politics
and
he
appeared
to
lean
as
often
towards
the
conservative
as
to
the
revolutionary
view
of
abstract
questions
the
newspaper
left
him
time
for
other
literary
work
and
it
was
known
to
a
few
people
that
he
wrote
with
some
regularity
for
reviews
but
all
the
products
of
his
pen
were
anonymous
a
fact
which
remained
his
own
secret
was
that
he
provided
for
the
subsistence
of
his
parents
old
people
domiciled
in
a
quiet
corner
of
their
native
kingsmill
the
strict
sobriety
of
life
which
is
indispensable
to
success
in
such
a
career
as
this
cost
him
no
effort
he
smoked
moderately
ate
and
drank
as
little
as
might
be
could
keep
his
health
on
six
hours
of
sleep
and
for
an
occasional
holiday
liked
to
walk
his
twenty
or
thirty
miles
earwaker
was
naturally
marked
for
survival
among
the
fittest
on
an
evening
of
june
in
the
year
he
was
interrupted
whilst
equipping
himself
for
dinner
abroad
by
a
thunderous
must
wait
my
friend
whoever
you
are
he
murmured
placidly
as
he
began
to
struggle
with
the
stiff
of
his
shirt
the
knock
was
repeated
and
more
violently
there
only
one
man
of
my
acquaintance
who
knocks
like
that
he
mused
elaborating
the
bow
of
his
white
tie
i
should
imagine
is
in
brazil
but
there
no
knowing
perhaps
our
office
is
on
anon
anon
he
made
haste
to
don
waistcoat
and
then
crossed
his
and
flung
open
the
door
of
the
chambers
then
it
you
i
was
reminded
of
your
patient
habits
a
tall
man
in
a
light
overcoat
and
a
straw
hat
of
spacious
brim
had
seized
both
his
hands
with
shouts
of
excited
greeting
you
why
did
you
keep
me
waiting
i
thought
i
had
missed
you
for
the
evening
how
the
deuce
are
you
and
why
the
devil
have
you
left
me
without
a
line
from
you
for
more
than
six
months
earwaker
drew
aside
and
allowed
his
tumultuous
friend
to
rush
into
the
nearest
room
have
you
written
confound
you
was
again
vociferated
amid
bursts
of
boyish
laughter
has
anybody
written
everybody
was
as
well
informed
of
your
movements
as
i
i
wonder
replied
the
journalist
you
left
buenos
ayres
i
have
had
two
letters
each
containing
twenty
words
which
gave
me
to
understand
that
no
answer
could
by
possibility
reach
you
you
could
have
written
to
likely
places
did
i
really
say
that
ha
ha
ha
shake
hands
again
confound
you
how
do
you
do
do
i
look
well
have
i
a
tropical
colour
i
say
what
a
blessed
thing
it
was
that
i
got
beaten
down
at
wattleborough
all
this
time
i
should
have
been
sitting
in
the
fog
at
westminster
what
a
time
had
what
a
time
i
had
it
was
more
than
twelve
months
since
malkin
departure
from
england
though
sun
and
sea
had
doubtless
contributed
to
his
robustness
he
must
always
have
been
a
fair
example
of
the
vigorous
briton
his
broad
shoulders
upright
bearing
open
countenance
and
frank
resonant
voice
declared
a
youth
passed
amid
the
wholesome
conditions
which
wealth
alone
can
command
the
hearty
extravagance
of
his
friendliness
was
only
possible
in
a
man
who
has
never
been
humiliated
by
circumstances
never
restricted
in
his
natural
needs
of
body
and
mind
yet
he
had
more
than
the
heartiness
of
a
contented
englishman
the
vivacity
which
made
a
whirlwind
about
him
probably
indicated
some
ancestral
mingling
with
the
blood
of
a
more
ardent
race
earwaker
examined
him
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
unfortunate
he
said
i
have
to
go
out
to
dinner
pooh
we
can
get
dinner
anywhere
doubt
but
i
am
engaged
devil
you
are
who
is
she
why
did
you
write
to
tell
me
word
has
a
less
specific
meaning
my
dear
fellow
replied
earwaker
laughing
you
of
all
men
would
have
rushed
at
the
wrong
one
i
mean
to
say
if
your
excitement
can
take
in
so
common
a
fact
that
i
have
promised
to
dine
with
some
people
at
notting
hill
and
must
disappoint
them
malkin
laughed
at
his
mistake
then
shouted
hill
is
that
somewhere
near
fulham
we
take
a
cab
and
i
can
drop
you
on
my
way
would
be
on
the
way
at
all
the
journalist
quiet
explanation
was
cut
short
by
a
petulant
outcry
very
well
of
course
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
i
should
have
thought
after
sixteen
months
be
idiotic
broke
in
the
other
a
strong
feminine
element
in
you
malkin
that
exactly
the
kind
of
talk
with
which
women
drive
men
to
frenzy
element
shouted
the
traveller
with
hot
face
do
you
mean
i
propose
to
take
a
cab
with
you
and
you
earwaker
turned
away
laughing
and
distance
are
nothing
to
you
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
come
by
all
means
his
friend
was
instantly
appeased
let
me
make
you
late
earwaker
must
we
start
this
moment
come
along
then
can
i
carry
anything
for
you
lord
if
you
could
only
see
a
tropical
forest
how
do
you
get
on
with
old
runcorn
what
the
devil
was
the
use
of
my
writing
when
words
are
powerless
to
describe
what
a
rum
old
place
this
seems
after
experiences
like
mine
how
the
deuce
can
you
live
here
i
say
i
brought
you
a
ton
of
curiosities
will
make
your
rooms
look
like
a
museum
confound
it
broken
my
shin
against
the
turn
in
the
staircase
whew
who
are
you
going
to
dine
with
moxey
never
heard
the
name
in
holborn
a
hansom
was
hailed
and
the
friends
continued
their
dialogue
as
they
drove
westward
having
at
length
effervesced
malkin
began
to
exchange
question
and
answer
with
something
of
the
calm
needful
for
mutual
intelligibility
how
do
you
get
on
with
old
runcorn
well
as
can
be
expected
where
there
is
not
a
single
subject
of
agreement
earwaker
replied
have
hopes
of
reducing
our
circulation
the
deuce
do
you
mean
other
words
of
improving
the
paper
runcorn
is
strong
on
the
side
of
blackguardism
we
had
a
great
fight
the
other
day
over
a
leader
offered
by
kenyon
a
true
effusion
of
the
political
i
refused
to
let
it
go
in
runcorn
swore
that
if
i
did
not
should
go
i
offered
to
retire
that
moment
we
must
write
for
our
public
he
bellowed
true
said
i
but
not
necessarily
for
the
basest
among
them
the
standard
at
the
best
is
low
enough
do
you
call
yourself
a
radical
not
if
this
be
radicalism
you
ought
to
be
on
the
instead
of
the
i
had
my
way
and
probably
shall
end
by
sending
mr
kenyon
back
to
his
tinker
work
shop
if
not
i
must
look
out
for
cleaner
occupation
it
my
boy
go
it
cried
malkin
slapping
his
companion
knee
violently
the
tone
to
the
devil
with
mercenary
considerations
help
the
proletariat
out
of
its
grovelling
position
they
approached
the
street
where
earwaker
had
to
alight
the
other
declared
his
intention
of
driving
on
to
fulham
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
friend
who
lived
there
i
must
see
you
again
when
shall
you
be
home
eleven
i
dare
say
if
i
am
free
i
come
out
to
staple
inn
and
we
talk
till
three
or
four
the
house
at
which
the
journalist
presented
himself
was
such
as
might
be
inhabited
by
a
small
family
of
easy
means
as
he
was
taking
off
his
overcoat
a
door
opened
and
christian
moxey
came
forward
to
greet
him
they
shook
hands
like
men
who
stood
on
friendly
but
not
exactly
on
intimate
terms
you
come
up
to
the
laboratory
for
a
moment
said
moxey
should
like
to
show
you
something
i
have
under
the
microscope
the
room
he
spoke
of
was
at
the
top
of
the
house
two
chambers
had
been
made
into
one
and
the
fittings
were
those
required
by
a
student
of
physical
science
various
odours
distressed
the
air
a
stranger
to
the
pursuits
represented
might
have
thought
that
the
general
disorder
and
encumberment
indicated
great
activity
but
the
experienced
eye
perceived
at
once
that
no
methodical
work
was
here
in
progress
mineralogy
botany
biology
physics
and
probably
many
other
sciences
were
suggested
by
the
specimens
and
apparatus
that
lay
confusedly
on
tables
shelves
or
floor
moxey
looked
very
slim
and
elegant
in
his
evening
costume
when
he
touched
any
object
his
long
translucent
fingers
seemed
soft
and
sensitive
as
a
girl
he
stepped
with
peculiar
lightness
and
the
harmonious
notes
of
his
voice
were
in
keeping
with
these
other
characteristics
ten
years
had
developed
in
him
that
graceful
languor
which
at
was
only
beginning
to
get
mastery
over
the
energies
of
a
frame
stuff
here
he
said
pointing
to
an
open
box
full
of
mud
silt
from
down
the
thames
it
positively
loaded
with
you
remember
our
talking
about
them
when
you
were
last
here
i
am
working
at
the
fabric
of
the
valves
now
just
look
earwaker
with
attentive
smile
followed
the
demonstration
is
busy
with
them
as
well
said
christian
presently
he
told
you
his
theory
of
their
locomotion
nobody
has
found
out
yet
how
the
little
beggars
move
about
peak
has
a
bright
idea
they
spent
ten
minutes
in
the
laboratory
then
went
downstairs
two
other
guests
had
meanwhile
arrived
and
were
conversing
with
the
hostess
miss
moxey
the
shy
awkward
girl
was
grown
into
a
woman
whose
face
made
such
declaration
of
intellect
and
character
that
after
the
first
moment
one
became
indifferent
to
its
lack
of
feminine
beauty
as
if
with
the
idea
of
compensating
for
personal
disadvantages
she
was
ornately
dressed
her
abundant
tawny
hair
had
submitted
to
much
manipulation
and
showed
the
gleam
of
jewels
expense
and
finished
craft
were
manifest
in
every
detail
of
her
garb
though
slightly
her
form
was
and
suggested
natural
vigour
like
christian
she
had
delicate
hands
you
know
a
distinguished
clergyman
named
chilvers
she
asked
of
earwaker
with
a
laugh
when
he
had
taken
a
place
by
her
is
it
bruno
chilvers
i
wonder
the
name
exclaimed
one
of
the
guests
a
young
married
lady
of
eager
face
and
fidgety
manners
i
knew
him
at
college
but
i
had
no
idea
he
was
become
distinguished
miss
moxey
again
laughed
it
amusing
the
narrowness
of
a
great
clerical
reputation
morton
was
astonished
that
i
had
never
heard
his
name
do
think
appealed
the
lady
looking
anxiously
at
earwaker
i
consider
it
shameful
not
to
know
him
i
only
happened
to
mention
a
very
ridiculous
sermon
of
his
that
was
forced
upon
me
by
a
distressingly
orthodox
friend
of
mine
they
tell
me
he
is
one
of
the
newest
lights
of
the
church
earwaker
listened
with
amusement
and
then
related
anecdotes
of
bruno
chilvers
whilst
he
was
talking
the
door
opened
to
admit
another
arrival
and
a
servant
voice
announced
peak
miss
moxey
rose
and
moved
a
step
or
two
forward
a
change
was
visible
on
her
countenance
which
had
softened
and
lightened
am
very
sorry
to
be
late
said
the
in
a
dull
and
rather
husky
voice
which
made
strong
contrast
with
the
humorous
tones
his
entrance
had
interrupted
he
shook
hands
in
silence
with
the
rest
of
the
company
giving
merely
a
nod
and
a
smile
as
reply
to
some
gracious
commonplace
from
morton
it
come
to
your
knowledge
earwaker
asked
of
him
bruno
chilvers
is
exciting
the
orthodox
world
by
his
defence
of
christianity
against
no
morton
tells
us
that
all
the
church
newspapers
ring
with
his
name
do
think
cried
morton
with
the
same
anxious
look
as
before
i
read
such
papers
we
never
have
such
a
thing
in
our
house
mr
peak
i
have
only
been
told
about
it
peak
smiled
gravely
but
made
no
other
answer
then
he
turned
to
earwaker
is
he
ca
say
perhaps
morton
tell
me
he
is
somewhere
in
norfolk
replied
the
lady
forget
the
town
a
summons
to
dinner
broke
off
the
conversation
moxey
offered
his
arm
to
the
one
lady
present
as
guest
and
earwaker
did
the
same
courtesy
to
the
hostess
morton
a
meditative
young
man
who
had
been
listening
with
a
smile
of
indifference
sauntered
along
in
the
rear
with
godwin
peak
at
the
peak
was
taciturn
and
seemed
to
be
musing
on
a
disagreeable
subject
to
remarks
he
answered
briefly
and
absently
as
moxey
earwaker
and
morton
kept
up
lively
general
talk
this
muteness
was
not
much
noticed
but
when
the
ladies
had
left
the
room
and
peak
still
frowned
over
his
wineglass
the
journalist
rebuked
him
the
matter
with
you
do
depress
us
the
other
laughed
impatiently
and
emptied
his
glass
has
come
back
pursued
earwaker
burst
in
upon
me
just
as
i
was
leaving
home
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
you
must
come
and
meet
him
some
evening
you
please
returned
to
the
upper
room
peak
seated
himself
in
a
shadowy
corner
crossed
his
legs
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
leaned
back
to
regard
a
picture
on
the
wall
opposite
this
attitude
gave
sufficient
proof
of
the
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
him
by
the
years
between
nineteen
and
even
in
a
he
could
take
his
ease
unconcernedly
his
face
would
have
led
one
to
suppose
him
an
older
man
it
was
set
in
an
expression
of
stern
if
not
morose
thoughtfulness
he
had
small
hard
lips
indifferent
teeth
seldom
exhibited
a
prominent
chin
a
long
neck
his
body
was
of
firm
not
ungraceful
build
society
evening
uniform
does
not
allow
a
man
much
scope
in
the
matter
of
adornments
it
was
plain
however
that
godwin
no
longer
scorned
the
tailor
and
haberdasher
he
wore
a
suit
which
confidently
challenged
the
criticism
of
experts
and
the
silk
socks
visible
above
his
shoes
might
have
been
selected
by
the
most
fastidious
of
worldlings
when
he
had
sat
there
for
some
minutes
his
eyes
happened
to
stray
towards
miss
moxey
who
was
just
then
without
a
companion
her
glance
answered
to
his
and
a
smile
of
invitation
left
him
no
choice
but
to
rise
and
go
to
a
seat
beside
her
are
meditative
this
evening
she
said
in
a
voice
subdued
below
its
ordinary
note
very
fit
for
society
to
tell
the
truth
godwin
answered
carelessly
has
such
moods
you
know
but
how
would
you
take
it
if
at
the
last
moment
i
sent
a
telegram
please
excuse
me
feel
able
to
talk
do
suppose
i
should
be
offended
you
would
you
know
less
of
me
than
i
thought
her
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
their
smile
betokening
an
uneasy
tells
me
she
continued
you
are
going
to
take
your
holiday
in
cornwall
thought
of
it
but
perhaps
i
sha
leave
town
at
all
it
be
worth
while
if
i
go
abroad
at
the
end
of
the
year
marcella
glanced
at
him
scheme
is
that
i
mentioned
it
i
want
to
go
to
south
america
and
the
pacific
islands
earwaker
has
a
friend
who
has
just
come
back
from
travel
in
the
tropics
the
talk
about
it
has
half
decided
me
to
leave
england
i
have
been
saving
money
for
years
to
that
end
never
spoke
of
it
to
me
marcella
replied
turning
a
bracelet
on
her
wrist
you
go
alone
course
i
could
travel
in
company
you
know
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
me
to
put
up
with
the
moods
and
idiosyncrasies
of
other
men
there
was
a
quiet
arrogance
in
his
tone
the
listener
still
smiled
but
her
fingers
worked
nervously
are
not
so
unsocial
as
you
pretend
she
remarked
without
looking
at
him
i
make
no
pretences
of
any
kind
was
his
scornful
answer
are
ungracious
this
evening
and
ca
hide
it
try
to
i
beg
but
at
least
tell
me
what
troubles
you
impossible
peak
replied
drily
friendship
goes
for
nothing
said
marcella
with
a
little
forced
laugh
in
all
but
a
very
few
human
concerns
how
often
could
tell
what
it
is
that
prevents
your
taking
life
cheerfully
he
glanced
at
her
and
marcella
eyes
fell
a
moment
after
there
was
a
suspicion
of
colour
in
her
cheek
are
you
reading
peak
asked
abruptly
but
in
a
voice
of
more
conventional
note
hafiz
envy
your
power
of
abstraction
i
hear
that
you
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
locomotive
powers
of
the
their
eyes
met
and
they
laughed
not
very
mirthfully
preserves
me
from
worse
follies
said
peak
all
there
are
ways
more
or
less
dignified
of
consuming
time
as
he
spoke
his
ear
caught
a
familiar
name
uttered
by
christian
moxey
and
he
turned
to
listen
moxey
and
earwaker
were
again
talking
of
the
rev
bruno
chilvers
straightway
disregarding
marcella
peak
gave
attention
to
the
men
dialogue
and
his
forehead
wrinkled
into
scornful
amusement
very
interesting
he
exclaimed
at
a
moment
when
there
was
silence
throughout
the
company
hear
that
chilvers
is
really
coming
to
the
front
at
whitelaw
it
used
to
be
prophesied
that
he
would
be
a
bishop
and
now
i
suppose
he
fairly
on
the
way
to
that
shall
we
write
letters
of
congratulation
to
him
earwaker
joint
epistle
if
you
like
morton
who
had
brightened
since
dinner
began
to
speak
caustically
of
the
form
of
intellect
necessary
nowadays
in
a
popular
clergyman
must
write
a
good
deal
put
in
earwaker
that
in
a
style
which
would
have
scandalised
the
orthodox
of
the
last
century
rationalised
dogma
is
vastly
in
demand
peak
voice
drew
attention
kinds
of
books
dealing
with
religion
are
now
greatly
popular
and
will
be
for
a
long
time
on
the
one
hand
there
is
that
growing
body
of
people
who
for
whatever
reason
tend
to
agnosticism
but
desire
to
be
convinced
that
agnosticism
is
respectable
they
are
eager
for
books
written
by
men
of
mark
they
could
endure
to
be
classed
with
bradlaugh
but
they
rank
themselves
confidently
with
darwin
and
huxley
arguments
matter
little
or
nothing
to
them
they
take
their
rationalism
as
they
do
a
fashion
in
dress
anxious
only
that
it
shall
be
good
form
then
there
the
other
lot
of
people
a
much
larger
class
who
wo
give
up
dogma
but
have
learnt
that
bishops
priests
and
deacons
no
longer
hold
it
with
the
old
rigour
and
that
one
must
be
broad
these
are
clamorous
for
treatises
which
pretend
to
reconcile
revelation
and
science
it
quite
pathetic
to
watch
the
enthusiasm
with
which
they
hail
any
man
who
distinguishes
himself
by
this
kind
of
apologetic
skill
this
pious
jugglery
never
mind
how
washy
the
book
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
only
let
it
obtain
vogue
and
it
will
be
glorified
as
the
new
evangel
the
day
has
gone
by
for
downright
assaults
on
science
to
be
marketable
you
must
prove
that
origin
of
was
approvingly
foreseen
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
and
that
the
apostles
creed
conflicts
in
no
single
point
with
the
latest
results
of
biblical
criticism
both
classes
seek
to
avoid
ridicule
and
to
adapt
themselves
to
a
standard
of
respectability
if
chilvers
goes
in
for
the
newest
apologetics
he
is
bound
to
be
enormously
successful
the
man
has
brains
and
really
there
are
so
few
such
men
who
still
care
to
go
into
the
church
there
was
a
murmur
of
laughing
approval
the
speaker
had
worked
himself
into
eloquent
nervousness
he
leaned
forward
with
his
hands
straining
together
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
quivering
is
it
surprising
said
marcella
how
short
a
time
this
apologetic
attitude
has
become
necessary
peak
flashed
a
triumphant
look
at
her
often
rejoice
to
think
of
it
he
cried
magnificent
it
is
that
so
many
of
the
solemn
jackasses
who
brayed
against
darwin
from
ten
to
twenty
years
ago
should
live
to
be
regarded
as
beneath
contempt
i
say
it
earnestly
this
thought
is
one
of
the
things
that
make
life
tolerable
to
me
have
need
of
charity
friend
peak
interposed
earwaker
is
the
spirit
of
the
persecutor
of
the
kind
it
is
the
spirit
of
justified
reason
you
may
say
that
those
people
were
honestly
mistaken
such
honesty
is
the
brand
of
a
brainless
obstructive
would
have
persecuted
but
too
gladly
there
were
and
are
men
who
would
have
committed
darwin
to
penal
servitude
if
they
had
had
the
power
men
like
lyell
who
were
able
to
develop
a
new
convolution
in
their
brains
i
respect
heartily
i
only
speak
of
the
squalling
mass
the
obscene
herd
of
idiot
mockers
assuredly
remarked
earwaker
no
shame
whatever
in
the
retrospect
of
their
idiocy
to
convert
a
is
a
subject
for
high
rejoicing
to
confute
a
is
worth
the
doing
is
philosophy
said
marcella
i
suspect
you
of
often
feeling
as
mr
peak
does
i
am
sure
do
peak
meeting
an
amused
glance
from
the
journalist
left
his
seat
and
took
up
a
volume
that
lay
on
one
of
the
tables
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
hands
shook
and
that
there
was
perspiration
on
his
forehead
with
pleasant
tact
moxey
struck
into
a
new
subject
and
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
peak
sat
apart
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
his
outburst
of
satire
and
invective
then
he
advanced
to
miss
moxey
again
for
the
purpose
of
taking
leave
this
was
the
signal
for
rising
and
in
a
few
minutes
both
men
had
left
the
house
go
by
train
with
you
said
earwaker
as
they
walked
away
street
will
suit
me
well
enough
peak
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
when
they
had
proceeded
a
little
distance
he
exclaimed
harshly
hate
emancipated
women
his
companion
stopped
and
laughed
loudly
i
hate
emancipated
women
the
other
repeated
with
deliberation
ought
neither
to
be
enlightened
nor
dogmatic
they
ought
to
be
sexual
unusual
brutality
on
your
part
you
know
what
i
mean
know
what
you
think
you
mean
said
earwaker
the
woman
who
is
neither
enlightened
nor
dogmatic
is
only
too
common
in
society
they
are
fools
and
troublesome
fools
peak
again
kept
silence
emancipated
woman
pursued
his
friend
be
a
miss
moxey
nor
yet
a
mrs
morton
moxey
is
intolerable
said
peak
ca
quite
say
why
i
dislike
her
so
but
she
grows
more
antipathetic
to
me
the
better
i
know
her
she
has
not
a
single
feminine
charm
not
one
i
often
feel
very
sorry
for
her
but
dislike
her
all
the
same
for
her
mused
earwaker
so
do
i
ca
like
her
either
she
is
certainly
an
incomplete
woman
but
her
mind
is
of
no
low
order
i
had
rather
talk
with
her
than
with
one
of
the
imbecile
prettinesses
i
half
believe
you
have
a
sneaking
sympathy
with
the
men
who
ca
stand
education
in
a
wife
possible
in
some
moods
no
mood
can
i
conceive
such
a
prejudice
i
have
no
great
attraction
to
women
of
any
kind
but
the
uneducated
woman
i
detest
so
do
i
muttered
peak
you
know
what
he
added
abruptly
shall
be
off
to
the
pacific
yes
i
shall
go
this
next
winter
my
mind
is
made
up
sha
try
to
dissuade
you
old
fellow
though
i
had
rather
have
you
in
sight
come
and
see
malkin
i
drop
you
a
note
with
an
appointment
they
soon
reached
the
station
and
exchanged
but
few
more
words
before
earwaker
leaving
the
train
at
farringdon
street
peak
pursued
his
journey
towards
the
of
london
on
reaching
home
the
journalist
flung
aside
his
foolish
coat
of
ceremony
indued
a
comfortable
jacket
lit
a
pipe
with
long
stem
and
began
to
glance
over
an
evening
newspaper
he
had
not
long
reposed
in
his
when
the
familiar
appeal
thundered
from
without
malkin
once
more
shook
his
hand
effusively
my
journey
to
fulham
for
nothing
did
matter
i
ran
over
to
putney
and
looked
up
my
old
landlady
the
rooms
are
occupied
by
a
married
couple
but
i
think
we
shall
succeed
in
persuading
them
to
make
way
for
me
i
promised
to
find
them
lodgings
every
bit
as
good
in
two
days
time
that
is
so
easy
why
not
take
the
new
quarters
yourself
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
think
of
it
oh
i
had
rather
have
the
old
crib
i
can
do
as
i
like
there
you
know
confound
it
now
i
shall
have
to
spend
all
for
other
people
could
i
pay
a
man
to
do
it
some
confidential
agent
private
police
you
know
what
i
mean
man
of
any
delicacy
replied
earwaker
with
grave
countenance
feel
bound
by
such
a
promise
to
personal
exertion
quite
right
i
did
mean
it
of
course
i
shall
hunt
conscientiously
oh
i
say
i
have
brought
over
a
couple
of
armadilloes
would
you
like
one
do
you
mean
alive
man
alive
they
only
need
a
little
care
i
should
think
you
might
keep
the
creature
in
your
kitchen
they
become
quite
affectionate
the
offer
was
unhesitatingly
declined
and
malkin
looked
hurt
there
needed
a
good
deal
of
genial
explanation
before
earwaker
could
restore
him
to
his
sprightly
mood
have
you
been
dining
cried
the
traveller
ah
i
remember
but
who
moxey
a
new
acquaintance
eh
i
have
known
him
about
six
months
got
to
know
him
through
peak
peak
what
the
fellow
you
once
told
me
about
who
disappeared
from
whitelaw
because
of
his
uncle
the
man
man
rather
yes
the
i
remember
you
have
met
him
again
why
on
earth
did
you
tell
me
in
your
letters
what
became
of
him
tell
me
the
story
if
you
will
cease
to
shake
down
plaster
from
the
we
met
in
a
restaurant
appropriate
scene
happening
to
sit
at
the
same
table
whilst
eating
we
stared
at
each
other
fitfully
i
be
hanged
if
that
is
peak
i
kept
saying
to
myself
and
at
the
same
moment
we
opened
our
lips
to
question
each
other
the
same
thing
happened
once
to
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
friend
of
his
but
it
was
on
board
ship
and
both
were
devilish
seasick
walker
you
remember
my
friend
walker
tells
the
story
in
a
way
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
walker
the
last
time
i
met
him
he
was
travelling
agent
for
a
menagerie
a
most
interesting
fellow
but
i
beg
your
pardon
go
on
old
fellow
after
that
we
at
once
saw
a
good
deal
of
each
other
he
has
been
working
for
years
at
a
chemical
factory
down
on
the
river
moxey
used
to
be
there
and
got
him
the
place
oh
yes
the
man
you
dined
with
you
must
remember
that
these
are
new
names
to
me
i
must
know
all
these
new
people
i
say
you
mind
shall
be
presented
to
the
whole
multitude
as
soon
as
you
like
peak
wants
to
see
you
he
thinks
of
an
excursion
like
this
last
of
yours
does
by
jove
we
go
together
i
have
always
wanted
a
travelling
companion
we
start
as
soon
as
ever
he
likes
well
in
a
month
or
two
i
must
just
have
time
to
look
round
oh
i
have
done
with
the
tropics
yet
i
must
tell
him
of
a
rattling
good
i
have
invented
i
think
of
patenting
it
i
say
how
does
one
get
a
patent
quite
a
simple
matter
i
suppose
always
has
been
the
simplest
and
least
worrying
of
all
business
enterprises
eh
that
smile
of
yours
means
mischief
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
had
got
back
to
the
subject
of
history
did
he
really
run
away
because
of
the
malkin
inquired
shall
never
venture
to
ask
and
it
not
very
likely
he
will
admit
it
it
was
some
time
before
he
cared
to
talk
much
of
whitelaw
what
is
he
doing
you
used
to
think
he
would
come
out
strong
did
you
has
he
written
anything
few
things
in
five
or
six
years
ago
the
atheistic
paper
but
he
ashamed
of
it
now
that
belongs
to
a
bygone
stage
of
development
orthodox
earwaker
laughed
only
mean
that
he
is
ashamed
of
the
connection
with
rationalism
right
devilish
low
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
went
in
for
it
myself
once
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
i
debated
with
a
parson
on
waste
fact
that
was
in
my
days
a
crowd
of
applauded
me
in
the
most
flattering
i
say
earwaker
you
have
any
whisky
me
your
conversation
makes
me
forget
hospitality
shall
i
make
hot
water
i
have
a
for
me
i
get
in
such
a
deuced
perspiration
when
i
begin
to
try
this
tobacco
the
last
of
half
a
i
took
in
at
bahia
the
traveller
refreshed
himself
with
a
full
tumbler
and
resumed
the
conversation
cheerily
he
just
been
wasting
his
time
then
all
these
years
goes
in
for
science
laboratory
work
evolutionary
speculations
of
course
i
ca
judge
his
progress
in
such
matters
but
moxey
a
clever
man
in
the
same
line
thinks
very
highly
of
him
the
fellow
to
travel
with
i
want
to
get
hold
of
some
solid
scientific
ideas
but
i
have
the
patience
to
work
steadily
a
confounded
fault
of
mine
you
know
earwaker
want
of
patience
you
must
have
noticed
it
well
now
and
then
perhaps
yes
but
of
course
i
know
myself
better
and
now
tell
me
about
moxey
a
married
man
of
course
lives
with
a
sister
sister
brains
well
supplied
with
that
commodity
must
introduce
me
to
her
i
do
like
women
with
or
enlightened
enlightened
magnificent
oh
i
must
know
her
nothing
like
an
emancipated
woman
how
any
man
can
marry
the
ordinary
female
passes
my
understanding
what
do
think
opinions
are
in
suspense
not
yet
precipitated
as
peak
might
say
one
sounded
from
neighbouring
churches
but
malkin
was
wide
awake
as
ever
he
entered
upon
a
detailed
narrative
of
his
travels
delightful
to
listen
to
so
oddly
blended
were
the
strains
of
conscious
and
unconscious
humour
which
marked
his
personality
two
three
he
would
have
talked
till
but
at
last
earwaker
declared
that
the
hour
had
come
for
sleep
as
malkin
had
taken
a
room
at
the
inns
of
court
hotel
it
was
easy
for
him
to
repair
to
his
quarters
the
last
his
friend
heard
of
him
was
an
unexplained
laugh
echoing
far
down
the
staircase
chapter
ii
peak
destination
was
peckham
rye
on
quitting
the
railway
he
had
a
walk
of
some
ten
minutes
along
a
road
which
smelt
of
new
bricks
and
stucco
heated
by
the
summer
sun
an
obscure
passage
led
him
into
a
street
partly
of
partly
of
shops
the
latter
closed
he
paused
at
the
side
door
of
one
over
which
the
street
lamp
dimly
revealed
herbalist
his
admitted
him
to
total
darkness
but
he
moved
forward
with
the
confidence
of
long
use
he
softly
ascended
two
flights
of
stairs
opened
a
door
struck
a
match
and
found
himself
in
a
comfortable
soon
illumined
by
a
the
atmosphere
as
throughout
the
house
was
strongly
redolent
of
dried
simples
anyone
acquainted
with
the
characteristics
of
furnished
lodgings
must
have
surmised
that
peak
dwelt
here
among
his
own
moveables
and
was
indebted
to
the
occupier
of
the
premises
for
bare
walls
alone
the
tables
and
chairs
though
plain
enough
were
such
as
civilisation
permits
and
though
there
were
no
pictures
sundry
ornaments
here
and
there
made
strong
denial
of
affinity
it
was
at
once
laboratory
study
and
two
large
cabinets
something
the
worse
for
transportation
alone
formed
a
link
between
this
abode
and
the
old
home
at
twybridge
books
were
not
numerous
and
a
good
microscope
seemed
to
be
the
only
scientific
instrument
of
much
importance
on
hung
a
knapsack
a
botanist
vasculum
and
a
geologist
wallet
a
round
table
was
spread
with
the
materials
of
supper
and
here
again
an
experienced
lodger
must
have
bestowed
contemplative
scrutiny
for
no
hand
of
common
landlady
declared
itself
in
the
arrangement
the
cloth
was
spotless
the
utensils
tasteful
and
carefully
disposed
in
a
bowl
lay
an
appetising
salad
ready
for
mingling
a
fragment
of
camembert
cheese
was
relieved
upon
a
setting
of
green
leafage
a
bottle
of
ale
with
adjacent
corkscrew
stood
beside
the
plate
the
very
loaf
seemed
to
come
from
no
ordinary
baker
or
was
made
to
look
better
than
its
kin
by
the
fringed
white
cloth
in
which
it
nestled
the
custom
of
four
years
had
accustomed
peak
to
take
these
things
as
a
matter
of
course
yet
he
would
readily
have
admitted
that
they
were
extraordinary
enough
indeed
he
even
now
occasionally
contrasted
this
state
of
comfort
with
the
hateful
experiences
of
his
first
six
years
in
london
the
subject
of
lodgings
was
one
of
those
on
which
often
intemperate
of
speech
he
spoke
least
temperately
for
six
years
he
had
shifted
from
quarter
to
quarter
from
house
to
house
driven
away
each
time
by
the
hateful
contact
of
vulgarity
in
every
form
by
foulness
and
dishonesty
by
lying
slandering
quarrelling
by
drunkenness
by
brutal
vice
by
all
abominations
that
distinguish
the
of
the
metropolis
obliged
to
practise
extreme
economy
he
could
not
take
refuge
among
people
or
at
all
events
had
no
luck
in
endeavouring
to
find
such
among
the
poorer
to
a
man
of
godwin
idiosyncrasy
the
london
poor
were
of
necessity
abominable
and
it
anguished
him
to
be
forced
to
live
among
them
rescue
came
at
last
and
in
a
very
unexpected
way
resident
in
the
more
open
part
of
bermondsey
winter
mornings
made
a
long
journey
to
rotherhithe
intolerable
he
happened
to
walk
one
day
as
far
as
peckham
rye
and
was
there
attracted
by
the
shop
window
of
a
herbalist
he
entered
to
make
a
purchase
and
got
into
conversation
with
button
a
man
of
bright
intelligence
and
more
reading
than
could
be
expected
the
herbalist
led
his
customer
to
an
upper
room
in
which
were
stored
sundry
curiosities
and
happened
casually
to
say
that
he
was
desirous
of
finding
a
lodger
for
two
superfluous
chambers
inquiries
led
to
his
seeing
button
whom
he
found
to
be
a
frenchwoman
of
very
pleasing
appearance
she
spoke
fluent
anything
but
disagreeable
to
an
ear
constantly
tormented
by
the
london
vernacular
after
short
reflection
he
decided
to
take
and
furnish
the
rooms
it
proved
a
most
fortunate
step
for
he
lived
after
the
outlay
for
furniture
at
much
less
expense
than
theretofore
and
in
comparative
luxury
cleanliness
neatness
good
taste
by
no
means
exhausted
button
virtues
her
cooking
seemed
to
the
lodger
of
incredible
perfection
and
the
infinite
goodwill
with
which
he
was
tended
made
strange
contrast
with
the
base
usage
he
had
commonly
experienced
in
these
ten
years
he
had
paid
but
four
visits
to
twybridge
each
of
brief
duration
naturally
there
were
changes
among
his
kinsfolk
charlotte
after
an
engagement
which
prolonged
itself
to
the
fifth
twelvemonth
had
become
cusse
and
her
husband
now
had
a
shop
of
his
own
with
two
children
already
born
into
the
world
of
draperdom
oliver
twice
fruitlessly
affianced
had
at
length
when
wedded
a
young
person
whom
his
mother
and
his
aunt
both
regarded
as
a
most
undesirable
connection
the
daughter
aged
of
a
man
who
was
drinking
himself
to
death
on
such
money
as
he
could
earn
by
casual
reporting
for
a
twybridge
newspaper
mrs
peak
the
elder
now
abode
with
her
sister
at
the
millinery
shop
and
saw
little
of
her
two
married
children
with
oliver
and
charlotte
their
brother
had
no
sympathy
and
affected
none
he
never
wrote
to
them
nor
they
to
him
but
years
had
strengthened
his
regard
for
his
mother
and
with
her
he
had
fairly
regular
correspondence
gladly
he
would
have
seen
her
more
often
but
the
air
of
shopkeeping
he
was
compelled
to
breathe
when
he
visited
twybridge
nauseated
and
repelled
him
he
recognised
the
suitability
both
of
oliver
and
charlotte
for
the
positions
to
which
life
had
consigned
them
they
suffered
from
no
profitless
aspiration
but
it
seemed
to
him
a
just
cause
of
quarrel
with
fate
that
his
kindred
should
thus
have
relapsed
instead
of
bettering
the
rank
their
father
had
bequeathed
to
them
he
would
not
avow
to
such
friends
as
moxey
and
earwaker
the
social
standing
of
his
only
recognised
relatives
as
for
the
unrecognised
he
had
long
ago
heard
with
some
satisfaction
that
andrew
peak
having
ultimately
failed
in
his
kingsmill
venture
returned
to
london
encounter
with
the
fatal
andrew
had
been
spared
him
ever
since
that
decisive
day
when
master
jowey
peak
recited
from
coleridge
and
displayed
his
etymological
genius
for
himself
he
had
earned
daily
bread
and
something
more
he
had
studied
in
desultory
fashion
he
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
british
isles
and
had
visited
paris
the
result
of
it
all
was
gnawing
discontent
intervals
of
furious
revolt
periods
of
black
despair
he
had
achieved
nothing
and
he
was
alone
young
still
to
be
sure
at
it
is
too
early
to
abandon
ambitions
which
are
supported
by
force
of
brain
and
of
will
but
circumstances
must
needs
help
if
the
desires
of
his
soul
were
to
be
attained
on
first
coming
to
london
received
with
all
friendliness
by
christian
moxey
he
had
imagined
that
it
only
depended
upon
himself
to
find
admission
before
long
to
congenial
society
by
which
he
then
understood
the
companionship
of
intelligent
and
aspiring
young
men
christian
however
had
himself
no
such
circle
and
knew
that
the
awkward
lad
from
twybridge
could
not
associate
with
the
one
or
two
wealthy
families
to
which
he
could
have
presented
him
the
school
of
mines
was
only
technically
useful
it
helped
godwin
to
get
his
place
with
bates
sons
but
supplied
no
friendships
in
the
third
year
moxey
inherited
means
and
left
the
chemical
works
for
continental
travel
by
tormenting
attraction
godwin
was
often
led
to
walk
in
the
wealthy
districts
of
london
why
was
no
one
of
these
doors
open
to
him
there
were
his
equals
not
in
the
mean
streets
where
he
dwelt
there
were
the
men
of
culture
and
capacity
the
women
of
exquisite
person
and
exalted
mind
was
he
the
inferior
of
such
people
by
heaven
no
he
chanced
once
to
be
in
hyde
park
on
the
occasion
of
some
public
ceremony
and
was
brought
to
pause
at
the
edge
of
a
gaping
plebeian
crowd
drawn
up
to
witness
the
passing
of
aristocratic
vehicles
close
in
front
of
him
an
open
carriage
came
to
a
stop
in
it
sat
or
rather
reclined
two
ladies
old
and
young
upon
this
picture
godwin
fixed
his
eyes
with
the
intensity
of
fascination
his
memory
never
lost
the
impress
of
these
ladies
faces
nothing
very
noteworthy
about
them
but
to
godwin
they
conveyed
a
passionate
perception
of
all
that
is
implied
in
social
superiority
here
he
stood
one
of
the
multitude
of
the
herd
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
boors
and
and
within
reach
of
his
hand
reposed
those
two
ladies
in
olympian
calm
seeming
unaware
even
of
the
existence
of
the
throng
now
they
exchanged
a
word
now
they
smiled
to
each
other
how
delicate
was
the
moving
of
their
lips
how
fine
must
be
their
enunciation
on
the
box
sat
an
old
coachman
and
a
young
footman
they
too
were
splendidly
impassive
scornful
of
the
multitudinous
the
block
was
relieved
and
on
the
carriage
rolled
they
were
his
equals
those
ladies
merely
his
equals
with
such
as
they
he
should
by
right
of
nature
associate
in
his
rebellion
he
could
not
hate
them
he
hated
the
malodorous
rabble
who
stared
insolently
at
them
and
who
envied
their
immeasurable
remoteness
of
mere
wealth
he
thought
not
might
he
only
be
recognised
by
the
gentle
of
birth
and
breeding
for
what
he
really
was
and
be
rescued
from
the
promiscuity
of
the
vulgar
yet
at
this
time
he
was
drawn
into
connection
with
the
movement
of
popular
radicalism
which
revolts
against
religious
respectability
inherited
antipathy
to
all
conventional
forms
of
faith
outweighed
his
other
prejudices
so
far
as
to
induce
him
to
write
savage
papers
for
personal
contact
with
artisan
freethinkers
was
disgusting
to
him
from
the
meeting
of
emancipated
workmen
he
went
away
with
scorn
and
detestation
in
his
heart
but
in
the
quiet
of
his
lodgings
he
could
sit
down
to
aid
their
propaganda
one
explanation
of
this
inconsistency
lay
in
the
fact
that
no
other
channel
was
open
to
his
literary
impulses
pure
science
could
not
serve
him
for
he
had
no
original
results
to
announce
pure
literature
seemed
beyond
his
scope
yet
he
was
constantly
endeavouring
to
express
himself
he
burned
with
the
desire
of
fame
and
saw
no
hope
of
achieving
it
save
as
an
author
would
serve
him
as
a
first
step
in
time
he
might
get
foothold
in
the
monthly
reviews
and
see
his
name
side
by
side
with
those
of
the
leaders
of
thought
occasions
of
course
offered
when
he
might
have
extended
his
acquaintance
but
they
were
never
of
a
kind
that
he
cared
to
use
at
best
they
would
only
have
admitted
him
to
the
homes
of
decent
families
and
for
such
society
he
was
altogether
unfitted
the
licence
of
the
streets
but
seldom
allured
him
after
his
year
he
was
proof
against
the
decoys
of
venal
pleasure
and
lived
a
life
of
asceticism
exceedingly
rare
in
young
and
lonely
men
when
christian
moxey
returned
to
london
and
took
the
house
at
notting
hill
which
he
henceforth
occupied
together
with
his
sister
a
possibility
of
social
intercourse
at
length
appeared
indeed
it
was
a
substantial
gain
to
sit
from
time
to
time
at
a
civilised
table
and
to
converse
amid
graceful
surroundings
with
people
who
at
all
events
followed
the
intellectual
current
of
the
day
careless
hitherto
of
his
personal
appearance
he
now
cultivated
an
elegance
of
attire
in
conformity
with
his
aristocratic
instincts
and
this
habit
became
fixed
when
next
he
visited
twybridge
the
change
in
his
appearance
was
generally
remarked
mrs
peak
naturally
understood
it
as
a
significant
result
of
his
intercourse
with
miss
moxey
of
whom
as
it
seemed
to
her
he
spoke
with
singular
reticence
but
marcella
had
no
charm
for
godwin
imagination
notwithstanding
that
he
presently
suspected
a
warmth
of
interest
on
her
side
which
he
was
far
from
consciously
encouraging
nor
did
he
find
among
his
friends
any
man
or
woman
for
whose
acquaintance
he
greatly
cared
the
moxeys
had
a
very
small
circle
consisting
chiefly
of
intellectual
inferiors
christian
was
too
indolent
to
make
a
figure
in
society
and
his
sister
suffered
from
peculiarities
of
mind
and
temperament
which
made
it
as
difficult
for
her
as
for
peak
himself
to
form
intimate
friendships
when
chance
encounter
brought
him
into
connection
with
earwaker
the
revival
of
bygone
things
was
at
first
doubtfully
pleasant
earwaker
himself
remarkably
developed
and
become
a
very
interesting
man
was
as
welcome
an
associate
as
he
could
have
found
but
it
cost
him
some
effort
to
dismiss
the
thought
of
andrew
peak
and
to
accept
the
friendly
tact
with
which
the
journalist
avoided
all
hint
of
unpleasant
memories
that
earwaker
should
refrain
from
a
single
question
concerning
that
abrupt
disappearance
nearly
ten
years
ago
sufficiently
declared
his
knowledge
of
the
unspeakable
cause
a
reflection
which
often
made
godwin
writhe
however
this
difficulty
was
overcome
and
the
two
met
very
frequently
for
several
weeks
godwin
enjoyed
better
spirits
than
he
had
known
since
the
first
excitement
of
his
life
in
london
faded
away
one
result
was
easily
foreseen
his
mind
grew
busy
with
literary
projects
many
that
he
had
long
contemplated
and
some
that
were
new
once
more
he
aimed
at
contributing
to
the
reviews
and
sketched
out
several
papers
of
sociological
tenor
none
of
these
were
written
as
soon
as
he
sat
down
to
deliberate
composition
a
sense
of
his
deficiencies
embarrassed
him
godwin
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
conceit
which
rests
on
imaginary
strength
power
there
was
in
him
of
that
he
could
not
but
be
conscious
its
true
direction
he
had
not
yet
learned
defect
of
knowledge
lack
of
confusion
and
contradictoriness
of
aims
instability
of
conviction
these
faults
he
recognised
in
himself
at
every
moment
of
inward
scrutiny
on
his
table
this
evening
lay
a
library
volume
which
he
had
of
late
been
reading
a
book
which
had
sprung
into
enormous
popularity
it
was
called
aspects
of
and
undertook
with
confidence
characteristic
of
its
kind
to
reconcile
the
latest
results
of
science
with
the
dogmas
of
oriental
religion
this
work
was
in
his
mind
when
he
spoke
so
vehemently
at
moxey
already
he
had
trembled
with
an
impulse
to
write
something
on
the
subject
and
during
his
journey
home
a
possible
essay
had
begun
to
shape
itself
late
as
was
the
hour
he
could
not
prepare
for
sleep
his
brain
throbbed
with
a
congestion
of
thought
he
struggled
to
make
clear
the
lines
on
which
his
satire
might
direct
itself
by
two
he
had
flung
down
on
paper
a
conglomerate
of
burning
ideas
and
thus
relieved
he
at
length
went
to
bed
two
days
later
came
a
note
from
staple
inn
inviting
him
to
meet
malkin
the
next
evening
by
this
time
he
had
made
a
beginning
of
his
critical
essay
and
the
exordium
so
far
satisfied
him
that
he
was
tempted
to
take
it
for
earwaker
judgment
but
no
better
his
friend
should
see
the
thing
when
it
was
complete
about
eight
he
reached
the
journalist
chambers
malkin
had
not
yet
arrived
peak
amused
himself
with
examining
certain
tropical
products
which
the
traveller
had
recently
cast
into
his
friend
then
sounded
a
knock
at
the
door
but
it
was
not
such
as
would
have
heralded
the
expected
man
telegram
observed
earwaker
and
went
to
take
it
in

returned
with
hoarse
sounds
of
mirth

characteristic
despatch

with

handbag
delivered
said
peak
would
represent
a
certain
stage
of
drunkenness
i
suppose
it
is
open
to
such
an
explanation
never
was
intoxicated
save
with
his
own
vivacity
they
discussed
the
singular
being
with
mirth
then
turned
by
degrees
to
other
topics
have
just
come
across
a
passage
that
will
delight
you
said
earwaker
taking
up
a
book
you
know
it
he
read
from
sir
thomas
brown
men
names
should
not
only
distinguish
them
a
man
should
be
something
that
all
men
are
not
and
individual
in
somewhat
beside
his
proper
name
thus
while
it
exceeds
not
the
bound
of
reason
and
modesty
we
can
not
condemn
singularity
numerus
is
the
motto
of
the
multitude
and
for
that
reason
are
they
fools
peak
laughed
his
approval
astonishes
me
he
said
lighting
his
pipe
you
can
go
on
writing
for
this
sunday
rag
when
you
have
just
as
little
sympathy
with
its
aims
as
i
have
do
get
into
some
less
offensive
connection
paper
would
you
recommend
asked
the
other
with
his
significant
smile
need
you
journalise
at
all
the
whole
i
like
it
and
remember
to
admit
that
the
multitude
are
fools
is
not
the
same
thing
as
to
deny
the
possibility
of
progress
you
really
believe
yourself
a
democrat
earwaker
m
m
well
yes
i
believe
the
democratic
spirit
is
stronger
in
me
than
any
other
peak
mused
for
a
minute
then
suddenly
looked
up
what
am
i
am
glad
nothing
much
depends
on
my
successfully
defining
you
they
laughed
together
suppose
said
godwin
ca
call
a
man
a
democrat
who
recognises
in
his
heart
and
soul
a
true
distinction
of
social
classes
social
mark
the
division
i
instinctively
support
is
by
no
means
intellectual
the
fool
is
very
often
more
sure
of
my
respect
than
the
working
man
who
struggles
to
a
fair
measure
of
education
earwaker
would
have
liked
to
comment
on
this
with
remarks
personal
to
the
speaker
but
he
feared
to
do
so
his
silence
however
was
eloquent
to
peak
who
resumed
brusquely
am
not
myself
though
if
my
parents
could
have
come
into
wealth
early
in
their
lives
perhaps
i
might
reasonably
have
called
myself
so
all
sorts
of
arguments
can
be
brought
against
my
prejudice
but
the
prejudice
is
ineradicable
i
respect
hereditary
social
standing
independently
of
the
individual
qualities
there
nothing
of
the
flunkey
in
this
or
i
greatly
deceive
myself
birth
in
a
sphere
of
refinement
is
desirable
and
respectable
it
saves
one
absolutely
from
many
forms
of
coarseness
the
masses
are
not
only
fools
but
very
near
the
brutes
yes
they
can
send
forth
fine
individuals
but
remain
base
i
do
deny
the
possibility
of
social
advance
i
only
say
that
at
present
the
lower
classes
are
always
disagreeable
often
repulsive
sometimes
hateful
could
apply
that
to
the
classes
above
them
i
ca
but
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
inconsistencies
in
me
now
the
other
day
i
was
reading
burns
and
i
could
describe
what
exaltation
all
at
once
possessed
me
in
the
thought
that
a
ploughman
had
so
glorified
a
that
together
they
shine
in
the
highest
heaven
far
above
all
the
monarchs
of
earth
this
came
upon
me
with
a
rush
a
very
rare
emotion
was
that
democratic
he
inquired
dubiously
and
earwaker
for
a
moment
had
no
reply
but
his
familiar
m
m
it
was
not
democratic
the
journalist
decided
at
length
was
pride
of
intellect
so
then
look
here
if
it
happens
that
a
whining
wretch
stops
me
in
the
street
to
beg
what
do
you
suppose
is
my
feeling
i
am
ashamed
in
the
sense
of
my
own
prosperity
i
ca
look
him
in
the
face
if
i
yielded
to
my
natural
impulse
i
should
cry
out
strike
me
spit
at
me
show
you
hate
me
anything
but
that
terrible
humiliation
of
yourself
before
me
that
how
i
feel
the
abasement
of
which
is
sensible
affects
on
his
behalf
i
give
money
with
what
delicacy
i
can
if
i
am
obliged
to
refuse
i
mutter
apologies
and
hurry
away
with
burning
cheeks
what
does
that
mean
earwaker
regarded
him
curiously
is
mere
fineness
of
humanity
moral
weakness
do
care
for
the
scalpel
of
the
pessimist
let
us
give
it
the
better
name
peak
had
never
been
so
communicative
his
progress
in
composition
these
last
evenings
seemed
to
have
raised
his
spirits
and
spurred
the
activity
of
his
mind
with
a
look
of
pleasure
he
pursued
his
antipathies
sometimes
explicable
enough
influence
me
very
widely
now
i
by
no
means
hate
all
orders
of
uneducated
people
a
hedger
a
fisherman
a
country
mason
people
of
that
kind
i
rather
like
to
talk
with
i
could
live
a
good
deal
with
them
but
the
london
vulgar
i
abominate
root
and
branch
the
mere
sound
of
their
voices
nauseates
me
their
vilely
grotesque
accent
and
pronunciation
bah
i
could
write
a
paper
to
show
that
they
are
essentially
the
basest
of
english
mortals
unhappily
i
know
so
much
about
them
if
i
saw
the
probability
of
my
dying
in
a
london
i
would
go
out
into
the
fields
and
there
kill
myself
earwaker
understood
much
by
this
avowal
and
wondered
whether
his
friend
desired
him
so
to
do
i
ca
say
that
i
have
any
affection
for
the
race
he
replied
certainly
believe
that
socially
and
politically
there
is
less
hope
of
them
than
of
the
lower
orders
in
any
other
part
of
england
are
damned
by
the
beastly
conditions
of
their
life
cried
godwin
excitedly
do
mean
only
the
all
all
hammersmith
as
much
as
i
must
write
about
this
i
must
indeed
by
all
means
nothing
would
benefit
you
more
than
to
get
your
soul
into
print
peak
delayed
a
little
then
i
am
doing
something
at
last
and
he
gave
an
account
of
his
projected
essay
by
this
time
his
hands
trembled
with
nervous
agitation
and
occasionally
a
dryness
of
the
palate
half
choked
his
voice
may
do
very
well
opined
earwaker
suppose
you
will
try
but
have
i
any
chance
can
a
perfectly
unknown
man
hope
to
get
in
they
debated
this
aspect
of
the
matter
seeing
peak
had
laid
down
his
pipe
the
journalist
offered
him
tobacco
i
ca
smoke
just
yet
it
my
misfortune
that
i
ca
talk
earnestly
without
throwing
my
body
into
disorder
stolid
i
am
in
comparison
said
earwaker
book
of
resumed
the
other
going
back
to
his
subject
suppose
the
clergy
accept
it
i
believe
peak
mused
if
i
were
a
clergyman
but
his
eye
met
earwaker
and
they
broke
into
laughter
not
pursued
godwin
i
ever
tell
you
that
my
people
originally
wished
to
make
a
parson
of
me
of
course
i
resisted
tooth
and
nail
but
it
seems
to
me
now
that
i
was
rather
foolish
in
doing
so
i
wish
i
been
a
parson
in
many
ways
the
position
would
have
suited
me
very
well
m
m
am
quite
serious
well
if
i
were
so
placed
i
should
preach
church
dogma
pure
and
simple
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
reconciliations
i
would
stand
firm
as
jeremy
taylor
and
in
consequence
should
have
an
immense
and
enthusiastic
congregation
daresay
upon
it
let
the
dogmas
do
what
they
still
can
there
a
vast
police
force
in
them
at
all
events
a
man
may
very
strongly
defend
himself
for
preaching
them
the
pursuit
of
this
argument
led
earwaker
to
ask
proportion
of
the
clergy
can
still
take
that
standing
in
stolid
conscientiousness
proportion
are
convinced
that
it
is
untenable
returned
peak
wilfully
shut
their
eyes
to
the
truth
they
do
shut
their
eyes
cried
godwin
merely
lower
a
nictitating
membrane
which
permits
them
to
gaze
at
light
without
feeling
its
full
impact
recommend
you
to
bring
that
into
your
paper
said
the
journalist
with
his
deep
chuckle
an
hour
later
they
were
conversing
with
no
less
animation
but
the
talk
was
not
so
critical
christian
moxey
had
come
up
as
a
topic
and
earwaker
was
saying
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
divine
the
personality
wo
easily
do
that
replied
peak
you
know
more
of
his
story
i
ca
see
that
i
am
bound
to
secrecy
at
all
events
with
you
poor
moxey
imagines
that
he
is
in
love
and
the
fancy
has
lasted
about
ten
years
years
i
first
knew
him
he
was
paying
obvious
attentions
to
a
rather
plain
cousin
down
at
twybridge
why
i
do
know
for
he
certainly
was
devoted
to
a
girl
here
in
london
all
he
has
confessed
to
me
is
that
he
had
given
up
hopes
of
her
but
that
a
letter
of
some
sort
or
other
revived
them
and
he
hastened
back
to
town
he
might
as
well
have
stayed
away
the
girl
very
soon
married
another
man
less
than
a
year
later
she
had
bitterly
repented
this
and
in
some
way
or
other
she
allowed
moxey
to
know
it
since
then
they
have
been
platonic
lovers
nothing
more
i
am
convinced
they
see
each
other
about
once
in
six
months
and
presumably
live
on
a
hope
that
the
obnoxious
husband
may
decease
i
only
know
the
woman
as
constance
never
saw
her
that
moxey
i
begin
to
understand
better
fellow
but
deplorably
weak
i
have
an
affection
for
him
and
have
had
from
our
first
meeting
mused
earwaker
and
shook
his
head
despise
them
the
whole
i
afraid
so
but
women
cried
the
other
with
impatience
would
be
just
as
reasonable
to
say
that
you
despise
men
ca
you
see
that
doubt
it
look
here
the
stock
objections
to
women
are
traditional
they
take
no
account
of
the
vast
change
that
is
coming
about
because
women
were
once
it
is
assumed
they
are
all
still
so
the
defect
of
the
female
mind
it
is
my
belief
that
this
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
defect
of
the
uneducated
human
mind
i
believe
most
men
among
the
brutally
ignorant
exhibit
the
very
faults
which
are
cried
out
upon
as
exclusively
feminine
a
woman
has
hitherto
been
an
ignorant
human
being
that
explains
everything
everything
something
perhaps
remember
your
evolutionism
the
preservation
of
the
race
demands
in
women
many
kinds
of
irrationality
of
obstinate
instinct
which
enrage
a
reasoning
man
do
suppose
i
speak
theoretically
four
or
five
years
ago
i
had
really
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
i
wasted
much
valuable
time
among
women
and
girls
of
anything
but
low
social
standing
but
my
passions
were
choked
by
my
logical
faculty
i
foresaw
a
terrible
possibility
that
i
might
beat
my
wife
one
thing
i
learned
with
certainty
was
that
the
woman
woman
hates
abstract
thought
hates
it
moreover
and
of
consequence
she
despises
every
ambition
that
has
not
a
material
end
he
enlarged
upon
the
subject
followed
it
into
all
its
ramifications
elaborated
the
inconsistencies
with
which
it
is
rife
peak
reply
was
deliberate
that
some
of
these
faults
are
rooted
in
sex
i
should
only
find
them
intolerable
when
their
expression
took
a
vulgar
form
between
irrationality
and
coarseness
of
mind
there
is
an
enormous
distinction
coarse
minds
i
have
nothing
to
do
me
if
i
ask
you
a
blunt
question
said
peak
after
hesitating
you
ever
associated
with
women
of
the
highest
refinement
earwaker
laughed
do
know
what
that
phrase
means
it
sounds
rather
odd
on
your
lips
women
of
the
highest
class
of
commoners
with
peeresses
we
need
concern
ourselves
imagine
that
social
precedence
makes
all
that
difference
in
women
i
do
the
daughter
of
a
county
family
is
a
finer
being
than
any
girl
who
can
spring
from
the
nomad
orders
supposing
your
nomads
produce
a
rachel
or
a
charlotte
brontee
are
not
talking
of
genius
peak
replied
was
irrelevant
i
well
yes
i
conversed
now
and
then
with
what
you
would
call
women
they
are
delightful
creatures
some
of
them
in
given
circumstances
but
do
you
think
i
ever
dreamt
of
taking
a
wife
drenched
with
social
prejudices
peak
face
expressed
annoyance
and
he
said
nothing
man
wife
pursued
earwaker
be
his
superior
in
whatever
you
like
social
position
that
is
precisely
the
distinction
that
no
woman
can
forget
or
forgive
on
that
account
they
are
the
obstructive
element
in
social
history
if
i
loved
a
woman
of
rank
above
my
own
she
would
make
me
a
renegade
for
her
sake
i
should
deny
my
faith
i
should
write
for
the
james
and
at
last
poison
myself
in
an
agony
of
shame
a
burst
of
laughter
cleared
the
air
for
a
moment
but
for
a
moment
only
peak
countenance
clouded
over
again
and
at
length
he
said
in
a
lower
tone
are
men
whose
character
would
defy
that
rule
to
their
own
disaster
but
i
ought
to
have
made
one
exception
there
is
a
case
in
which
a
woman
will
marry
without
much
regard
to
her
husband
origin
let
him
be
a
parson
and
he
may
aim
as
high
as
he
chooses
peak
tried
to
smile
he
made
no
answer
and
fell
into
a
fit
of
brooding
all
this
about
asked
the
journalist
when
he
too
had
mused
awhile
acquaintance
have
you
been
making
one
the
suspicion
was
inevitable
it
were
true
perhaps
you
would
be
justified
in
mistrusting
my
way
of
regarding
these
things
but
it
the
natural
tendency
of
my
mind
if
i
ever
marry
at
all
it
will
be
a
woman
of
far
higher
birth
than
my
own
malign
your
parents
old
fellow
they
gave
you
a
brain
inferior
to
that
of
few
men
you
will
never
meet
a
woman
of
higher
birth
a
friendly
sophism
i
ca
thank
you
for
it
because
it
has
a
bitter
side
but
the
compliment
had
excited
peak
and
after
a
moment
delay
he
exclaimed
have
no
other
ambition
in
life
no
other
think
the
confession
as
ridiculous
as
you
like
my
one
supreme
desire
is
to
marry
a
perfectly
refined
woman
put
it
in
the
correct
terms
i
am
a
plebeian
and
i
aim
at
marrying
a
lady
the
last
words
were
flung
out
defiantly
he
quivered
as
he
spoke
and
his
face
flushed
ca
wish
you
success
returned
his
friend
with
a
grave
smile
could
help
it
sounding
like
a
sneer
if
you
did
the
desire
is
hopeless
of
course
it
because
i
know
that
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
travel
for
a
year
or
two
it
help
me
on
towards
the
age
when
i
shall
regard
all
women
with
indifference
we
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
question
you
seriously
believe
that
you
could
find
satisfaction
in
the
life
to
which
such
a
marriage
would
condemn
you
life
asked
peak
impatiently
of
an
average
gentleman
let
us
say
with
house
in
town
and
country
with
friends
whose
ruling
motive
was
social
propriety
could
enjoy
the
good
and
throw
aside
the
distasteful
about
the
distastefulness
of
your
wife
crass
conventionalism
especially
in
religion
would
not
be
to
begin
with
if
her
religion
were
genuine
i
could
tolerate
it
well
enough
if
it
were
merely
a
form
i
could
train
her
to
my
own
opinions
society
is
growing
liberal
the
best
of
it
please
remember
that
i
have
in
mind
a
woman
of
the
highest
type
our
civilisation
can
produce
you
must
look
for
her
in
society
cried
earwaker
do
care
where
you
will
so
long
as
she
had
always
lived
among
people
of
breeding
and
high
education
and
never
had
her
thoughts
soiled
with
the
vile
contact
of
poverty
earwaker
started
up
and
reached
a
volume
from
a
shelf
quickly
finding
the
desired
page
he
began
to
read
aloud
had
the
world
in
its
caprice
deigned
to
proclaim
i
know
you
both
have
recognised
your
plighted
troth
am
sponsor
for
you
live
in
peace
he
read
to
the
end
of
the
poem
and
then
looked
up
with
an
admiring
smile
ideal
exclaimed
peak
ideal
akin
to
murger
and
grisettes
who
never
existed
ideal
most
decidedly
but
pray
what
is
this
consummate
lady
you
have
in
mind
an
ideal
every
bit
as
much
and
of
the
two
i
prefer
browning
for
my
own
part
i
am
a
polygamist
my
wives

in

and
too
far
asunder
to

able
to
quarrel
impossible
women
but
exquisite
they
shall
suffice

sauntered
about

for

minute
or
two
then
said
have

well

you

yet
nothing

night
let
me
hear
about
malkin
in
a
week
time
godwin
received
another
summons
to
staple
inn
with
promise
of
malkin
assured
presence
in
reply
he
wrote
to
a
new
arrangement
at
bates
i
start
tomorrow
for
my
holiday
in
cornwall
so
can
not
see
you
for
a
few
weeks
please
offer
malkin
my
apologies
make
them
i
mean
it
as
profuse
as
those
he
telegraphed
herewith
i
send
you
my
paper
the
new
sophistry
which
i
have
written
at
a
few
vehement
sittings
and
have
carelessly
copied
if
you
think
it
worth
while
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
send
it
for
me
to
i
have
signed
it
as
my
unmeaning
name
would
perhaps
indispose
the
fellow
to
see
much
good
in
it
i
should
thank
you
if
you
would
write
in
your
own
person
saying
that
you
act
for
a
friend
you
are
probably
well
known
in
those
quarters
if
it
is
accepted
time
enough
to
claim
my
glory
if
it
seems
to
you
to
have
no
chance
keep
it
till
i
return
as
i
hate
the
humiliation
of
do
think
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
the
other
night
we
will
never
speak
on
that
subject
again
all
i
said
was
horribly
sincere
but
i
afraid
you
ca
understand
that
side
of
my
nature
i
should
never
have
spoken
so
frankly
to
moxey
though
he
has
made
no
secret
with
me
of
his
own
weaknesses
if
i
perish
before
long
in
a
south
american
swamp
you
will
be
able
to
reflect
on
my
personality
with
completer
knowledge
so
i
do
regret
the
indiscretion
chapter
iii
et
godwin
peak
read
the
motto
beneath
the
clock
in
exeter
cathedral
and
believed
it
of
christian
origin
had
he
known
that
the
words
were
found
in
martial
his
rebellious
spirit
would
have
enjoyed
the
consecration
of
a
phrase
from
such
an
unlikely
author
even
as
he
must
have
laughed
had
he
stood
in
the
vatican
before
the
figures
of
those
two
greek
dramatists
who
for
ages
were
revered
as
christian
saints
his
ignorance
preserved
him
from
a
clash
of
sentiments
this
afternoon
he
was
not
disposed
to
cynicism
rather
he
welcomed
the
softening
influence
of
this
noble
interior
and
let
the
golden
sunlight
form
what
shapes
it
would
heavenly
beam
mystic
aureole
before
his
mind
eye
architecture
had
no
special
interest
for
him
and
the
history
of
church
or
faith
could
seldom
touch
his
emotions
but
the
glorious
handiwork
of
men
long
dead
the
solemn
stillness
of
an
ancient
sanctuary
made
that
appeal
to
him
which
is
independent
of
names
et
he
sat
down
where
the
soft
slow
ticking
of
the
clock
could
guide
his
thoughts
this
morning
he
had
left
london
by
the
earliest
train
and
after
a
night
in
exeter
would
travel
westward
by
leisurely
stages
seeing
as
much
as
possible
of
the
coast
and
of
that
inland
scenery
which
had
geological
significance
his
costume
declared
him
bent
on
holiday
but
at
the
same
time
distinguished
him
with
delicate
emphasis
from
the
tourist
of
the
season
trustworthy
sartorial
skill
had
done
its
best
for
his
person
sitting
thus
he
had
the
air
of
a
gentleman
who
enjoys
no
unwonted
ease
he
could
forget
himself
in
reverie
and
be
unaware
of
soft
footfalls
that
drew
near
along
the
aisle
but
the
sound
of
a
young
voice
subdued
yet
very
clear
made
claim
upon
his
attention
sidwell
she
who
spoke
was
behind
him
on
looking
up
he
saw
that
a
lady
just
in
front
had
stopped
and
turned
to
the
summons
smiling
she
retraced
her
steps
he
moved
so
as
to
look
discreetly
in
the
backward
direction
and
observed
a
group
of
four
persons
who
were
occupied
with
a
tablet
on
the
wall
a
young
man
not
long
out
of
boyhood
a
girl
who
might
be
a
year
or
two
younger
and
two
ladies
of
whom
it
could
only
be
said
that
they
were
mature
in
the
beauty
of
youth
probably
of
maidenhood
one
of
them
she
who
had
been
called
back
by
the
name
of
surely
an
uncommon
name
from
a
with
which
he
had
amused
himself
in
the
train
he
knew
that
one
of
the
churches
of
exeter
was
dedicated
to
sidwell
but
only
now
did
his
recollection
apprise
him
of
a
long
past
acquaintance
with
the
name
of
the
saint
had
not
buckland
warricombe
a
sister
called
sidwell
and
did
he
only
surmise
a
connection
between
the
warricombes
and
devon
no
no
on
that
remote
day
when
he
went
out
with
buckland
to
the
house
near
kingsmill
warricombe
spoke
to
him
of
exeter
mentioning
that
the
town
of
his
birth
was
axminster
where
william
buckland
the
geologist
also
was
born
whence
the
name
of
his
eldest
son
how
suddenly
it
all
came
back
he
rose
and
moved
apart
to
a
spot
whence
he
might
quietly
observe
the
strangers
once
remarked
could
not
be
confused
with
the
companion
of
her
own
age
she
was
slimmer
shorter
if
but
slightly
more
sedate
in
movement
and
perhaps
better
dressed
though
both
were
admirable
in
that
respect
ladies
beyond
a
doubt
and
the
young
man
at
this
distance
it
was
easy
to
deceive
oneself
but
did
not
that
face
bring
something
back
now
as
he
smiled
it
seemed
to
recall
buckland
warricombe
with
a
difference
this
might
well
be
a
younger
brother
there
used
to
be
one
or
two
they
were
familiar
with
the
cathedral
and
at
present
appeared
to
take
exclusive
interest
in
certain
mural
monuments
for
perhaps
ten
minutes
they
lingered
about
the
aisle
then
after
a
glance
at
the
west
window
went
forth
with
quick
step
godwin
pursued
them
he
issued
in
time
to
see
them
entering
an
open
carriage
which
presently
drove
away
towards
high
street
for
half
an
hour
he
walked
the
cathedral
close
not
long
ago
on
first
coming
into
that
quiet
space
with
its
old
houses
its
smooth
lawns
its
majestic
trees
he
had
felt
the
charm
peculiar
to
such
scenes
the
natural
delight
in
a
form
of
beauty
especially
english
now
the
impression
was
irrecoverable
he
could
see
nothing
but
those
four
persons
and
their
luxurious
carriage
and
the
two
beautiful
horses
which
had
borne
them
whither
as
likely
as
not
the
identity
he
had
supposed
for
them
was
quite
imaginary
yet
it
would
be
easy
to
ascertain
whether
a
warricombe
family
dwelt
at
exeter
the
forename
of
buckland
father
he
never
had
known
it
still
it
was
worth
while
consulting
a
directory
he
walked
to
his
hotel
yes
the
name
warricombe
stood
there
but
it
occurred
more
than
once
he
sought
counsel
of
the
landlord
which
of
these
warricombes
was
a
gentleman
of
position
with
sons
and
daughters
to
such
a
description
answered
martin
warricombe
esquire
well
known
in
the
city
his
house
was
in
the
old
tiverton
road
out
beyond
st
sidwell
two
miles
away
anyone
in
that
district
would
serve
as
guide
to
it
with
purpose
indefinite
godwin
set
forth
in
the
direction
suggested
at
little
more
than
a
saunter
he
passed
out
of
high
street
into
its
continuation
where
he
soon
descried
the
church
of
sidwell
and
thence
having
made
inquiry
walked
towards
the
old
tiverton
road
he
was
now
quite
beyond
the
town
limits
and
few
pedestrians
came
in
sight
if
he
really
wished
to
find
the
abode
of
martin
warricombe
he
must
stop
the
first
questionable
person
but
to
what
end
this
inquiry
he
could
not
even
be
certain
that
martin
was
the
man
he
had
in
mind
and
even
were
he
right
in
all
his
conjectures
what
had
he
to
do
with
the
warricombes
ten
years
ago
the
family
had
received
him
courteously
as
he
had
spent
an
hour
or
two
at
their
house
and
subsequently
a
few
words
had
passed
when
they
saw
him
on
at
whitelaw
to
buckland
he
had
never
written
he
had
never
since
heard
of
him
that
name
was
involved
in
the
miserable
whirl
of
circumstances
which
brought
his
college
life
to
a
close
and
it
was
always
his
hope
that
buckland
thought
no
more
of
him
even
had
there
been
no
disagreeable
memories
it
was
surely
impossible
to
renew
after
this
interval
so
very
slight
an
acquaintance
how
could
they
receive
him
save
with
civilly
mild
astonishment
an
came
along
whistling
townwards
a
big
basket
over
his
head
no
harm
in
asking
where
warricombe
lived
the
reply
was
prompt
second
house
on
the
right
hand
rather
a
large
one
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
onward
here
then
the
site
was
a
good
one
from
this
part
of
the
climbing
road
one
looked
over
the
lower
valley
of
the
exe
saw
the
whole
estuary
and
beyond
that
a
horizon
of
blue
sea
fair
rich
land
warm
under
the
westering
sun
the
house
itself
seemed
to
be
old
but
after
all
was
not
very
large
it
stood
amid
laurels
and
in
the
garden
behind
rose
a
great
no
person
was
visible
but
for
the
murmur
of
neighbouring
pines
scarce
a
sound
would
have
disturbed
the
air
godwin
walked
past
and
found
that
the
road
descended
into
a
deep
hollow
whence
between
high
banks
covered
with
gorse
and
bracken
and
many
a
summer
flower
it
led
again
up
a
hill
thick
planted
with
firs
at
the
lowest
point
was
a
bridge
over
a
streamlet
offering
on
either
hand
a
view
of
soft
green
meadows
a
spot
of
exquisite
retirement
happy
who
lived
here
in
security
from
the
struggle
of
life
it
was
folly
to
spoil
his
enjoyment
of
country
such
as
this
by
dreaming
impossible
opportunities
the
warricombes
could
be
nothing
to
him
to
meet
with
buckland
would
only
revive
the
shame
long
ago
outlived
after
resting
for
a
few
minutes
he
turned
back
passed
the
silent
house
again
delighted
himself
with
the
wide
view
and
so
into
the
city
once
more
where
he
began
to
seek
the
remnants
of
its
old
walls
the
next
morning
was
sunday
and
he
had
planned
to
go
by
the
plymouth
train
to
a
station
whence
he
could
reach
start
point
but
his
mood
was
become
so
unsettled
that
ten
when
already
he
should
have
been
on
his
journey
found
him
straying
about
the
cathedral
close
a
mere
a
vague
wavering
intention
which
might
at
any
moment
be
scattered
by
common
sense
drew
his
steps
to
the
door
of
the
cathedral
where
people
were
entering
for
morning
service
he
moved
idly
within
sight
of
the
carriages
which
drew
up
several
had
discharged
their
freightage
of
tailoring
and
millinery
when
two
vehicles
which
seemed
companions
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
from
the
second
alighted
the
young
ladies
whom
godwin
had
yesterday
observed
their
male
companion
however
was
different
the
carriage
in
advance
also
contained
four
persons
a
gentleman
of
sixty
his
wife
a
young
girl
and
the
youth
of
yesterday
it
needed
but
a
glance
to
inform
godwin
that
the
oldest
of
the
party
was
warricombe
buckland
father
ten
years
had
made
no
change
in
his
aspect
warricombe
was
not
less
recognisable
they
passed
at
once
into
the
edifice
and
he
had
scarcely
time
to
bestow
a
keen
look
upon
sidwell
that
was
a
beautiful
girl
he
stood
musing
upon
the
picture
registered
by
his
brain
but
why
not
follow
and
from
a
neighbouring
seat
survey
her
and
the
others
at
his
leisure
pooh
but
the
impulse
constrained
him
after
all
he
could
not
get
a
place
that
allowed
him
to
see
sidwell
her
companion
however
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
of
much
the
same
age
was
well
in
view
sisters
they
could
not
be
nothing
of
the
warricombe
countenance
revealed
itself
in
those
handsome
but
features
a
beautiful
girl
she
also
yet
of
a
type
that
made
slight
appeal
to
him
sidwell
was
all
he
could
imagine
of
sweet
and
dignified
more
modest
in
bearing
more
gracile
more
monday
at
noon
and
he
still
walked
the
streets
of
exeter
early
this
morning
he
had
been
out
to
the
old
tiverton
road
and
there
on
the
lawn
amid
the
laurels
had
caught
brief
glimpse
of
two
female
figures
in
one
of
which
he
merely
divined
sidwell
why
he
tarried
thus
he
did
not
pretend
to
explain
to
himself
rain
had
just
come
on
and
the
lowering
sky
made
him
he
mooned
about
the
street
under
his
umbrella
and
at
this
rate
might
vapour
away
his
holiday
exeter
was
tedious
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
set
forth
for
the
where
only
his
own
thoughts
awaited
him
packed
away
in
his
wallet
lay
geological
hammer
azimuth
compass
clinometer
miniature
microscope
why
should
he
drag
all
that
lumber
about
with
him
what
to
him
were
the
bygone
millions
of
ages
the
hoary
records
of
unimaginable
time
one
touch
of
a
girl
hand
one
syllable
of
musical
speech
was
it
not
that
whereof
his
life
had
truly
need
as
remote
from
him
however
as
the
age
of
the
pterodactyl
how
often
was
it
necessary
to
repeat
this
on
a
long
voyage
such
as
he
had
all
but
resolved
to
take
one
might
perchance
form
acquaintances
he
had
heard
of
such
things
not
impossibly
a
social
circle
might
open
to
him
at
buenos
ayres
but
here
in
england
his
poor
origin
his
lack
of
means
would
for
ever
bar
him
from
the
intimacy
of
people
like
the
warricombes
he
loitered
towards
the
station
dimly
conscious
of
a
purpose
to
look
for
trains
instead
of
seeking
the
he
stood
before
the
bookstall
and
ran
his
eye
along
the
titles
of
new
novels
he
had
half
a
mind
to
buy
one
of
hardy
and
read
himself
into
the
temper
which
suited
summer
rambles
but
just
as
his
hand
was
stretched
forth
a
full
voice
speaking
beside
him
made
demand
for
a
london
weekly
paper
instantly
he
turned
the
tones
had
carried
him
back
to
whitelaw
the
face
disturbed
that
illusion
but
substituted
a
reality
which
threw
him
into
tremor
his
involuntary
gaze
was
met
with
one
of
equal
intensity
a
man
of
his
own
years
but
in
splendid
health
and
with
bright
eyes
that
looked
enjoyment
of
life
suddenly
addressed
him
peak
surely
warricombe
no
less
surely
they
shook
hands
with
vigour
laughing
in
each
other
faces
then
after
a
moment
pause
warricombe
drew
aside
from
the
bookstall
for
sake
of
privacy
did
we
lose
sight
of
each
other
he
asked
flashing
a
glance
at
godwin
costume
did
you
write
to
me
at
cambridge
what
have
you
been
doing
this
have
been
in
london
all
the
time
am
there
most
of
the
year
well
i
rejoice
to
have
met
you
on
a
holiday
towards
cornwall
that
case
you
can
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
at
my
house
it
only
a
mile
or
two
off
i
was
going
to
walk
but
drive
if
you
like
there
was
no
refusing
and
no
possibility
of
reflection
hearty
manner
made
the
invitation
in
itself
a
thoroughly
pleasant
one
and
before
peak
could
sufficiently
command
his
thoughts
to
picture
the
scene
towards
which
he
was
going
they
were
walking
side
by
side
through
the
town
in
appearance
warricombe
showed
nothing
of
the
revolutionary
which
in
old
days
he
aimed
at
making
himself
and
his
speech
had
a
suavity
which
no
doubt
resulted
from
much
intercourse
with
the
polished
world
godwin
was
filled
with
envious
admiration
of
his
perfect
physique
and
the
mettle
which
kept
it
in
such
excellent
vigour
even
for
a
sturdy
walker
it
was
no
common
task
to

soon
found
himself
conversing
rather
too
breathlessly
for
comfort
is
your
latest
record
for
the
mile
he
inquired
warricombe
understanding
at
once
the
reference
to
his
old
athletic
pastime
and
its
present
application
laughed
merrily
and
checked
his
progress
bad
habit
of
mine
it
gets
me
into
trouble
with
everyone
have
you
become
a
stronger
man
than
used
to
seem
likely
i
quite
glad
to
see
how
well
you
look
the
sincerity
of
these
expressions
often
repeated
put
godwin
far
more
at
his
ease
than
the
first
moment
sensation
had
promised
he
too
began
to
feel
a
genuine
pleasure
in
the
meeting
and
soon
bade
defiance
to
all
misgivings
delicacy
perhaps
withheld
warricombe
from
further
mention
of
whitelaw
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
not
impossible
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
circumstances
which
tormented
godwin
memory
on
leaving
the
college
perchance
he
had
lost
all
connection
with
those
common
friends
who
might
have
informed
him
of
subsequent
jokes
and
rumours
unlikely
to
be
sure
for
doubtless
some
of
his
whitelaw
contemporaries
encountered
him
at
cambridge
and
again
was
it
not
probable
that
the
younger
warricombe
had
become
a
whitelaw
student
then
professor
gale
no
matter
the
warricombes
of
course
knew
all
about
andrew
peak
and
his
but
they
were
and
could
forgive
a
boy
weakness
as
well
as
overlook
an
acquaintance
obscure
origin
in
the
joy
of
finding
himself
exuberantly
welcomed
by
a
man
of
buckland
world
he
overcame
his
ignoble
you
know
that
we
were
in
this
part
of
the
country
warricombe
asked
once
more
speeding
ahead
always
thought
of
you
in
connection
with
kingsmill
gave
up
thornhaw
seven
years
ago
my
father
was
never
quite
comfortable
out
of
devonshire
the
house
i
am
taking
you
to
has
been
in
our
family
for
three
generations
i
have
often
tried
to
be
proud
of
the
fact
but
as
you
would
guess
that
kind
of
thing
does
come
very
natural
to
me
in
the
effort
to
repudiate
such
sentiment
buckland
distinctly
betrayed
its
hold
upon
him
he
imagined
he
was
meeting
godwin
on
equal
ground
but
the
sensibility
of
the
proletarian
could
not
thus
be
deceived
there
was
a
brief
silence
during
which
each
looked
away
from
the
other
keep
up
your
geology
was
warricombe
next
question
can
just
say
that
i
have
forgotten
it
all
afraid
that
more
than
i
can
during
my
cambridge
time
it
caused
disagreeable
debates
with
my
father
you
remember
that
his
science
is
of
the
old
school
i
would
say
a
word
to
disparage
him
i
believe
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
is
magnificent
but
he
ca
get
rid
of
that
old
man
of
the
sea
the
book
of
genesis
a
few
years
ago
i
too
considerate
in
argument
and
i
talked
as
i
ought
to
have
done
called
names
and
so
on
the
end
of
it
was
i
dropped
science
altogether
having
got
as
much
out
of
it
as
i
needed
the
good
old
pater
has
quite
forgiven
my
rudeness
at
present
we
agree
to
differ
and
get
on
capitally
i
sure
he
be
delighted
to
see
you
there
are
some
visitors
with
us
a
miss
moorhouse
and
her
brother
i
think
like
them
could
you
stay
overnight
godwin
was
unable
to
reply
on
the
instant
and
his
companion
proceeded
with
the
same
heartiness
as
you
like
you
know
but
do
stay
if
you
can
on
wednesday
morning
i
must
go
back
to
town
i
act
as
secretary
to
godolphin
the
member
for
slacksea
peak
acquaintance
with
current
politics
was
slight
but
ellis
godolphin
the
aristocratic
radical
necessarily
stood
before
his
imagination
with
some
clearness
of
outline
so
this
was
how
life
had
dealt
with
buckland
the
announcement
was
made
with
a
certain
satisfaction
as
if
it
implied
more
than
the
hearer
would
readily
appreciate
again
there
was
a
slight
shrinking
on
godwin
part
it
would
be
natural
for
him
to
avow
his
own
position
and
so
leave
no
room
for
misunderstandings
but
before
he
could
shape
a
phrase
buckland
was
again
questioning
you
ever
see
any
of
the
old
fellows
have
met
one
or
two
of
them
by
chance
as
if
his
tact
informed
him
that
this
inquiry
had
been
a
mistake
warricombe
resumed
the
subject
of
his
family
brother
louis
is
at
home
of
course
you
ca
remember
him
he
was
a
youngster
when
you
were
at
thornhaw
the
younger
boy
died
some
years
ago
a
pony
accident
cut
up
my
father
dreadfully
then
there
my
sister
sidwell
and
my
sister
fanny
that
all
of
us
i
ca
quite
answer
for
louis
but
the
rest
are
of
the
old
school
liberal
enough
do
be
afraid
but
well
the
old
school
as
godwin
kept
silence
the
speaker
shot
a
glance
at
him
keenly
scrutinising
their
eyes
did
not
meet
peak
kept
his
on
the
ground
much
about
politics
nowadays
very
much
say
that
i
do
myself
pursued
buckland
rather
drifted
into
it
godolphin
i
daresay
has
as
little
humbug
about
him
as
most
parliamentarians
we
stick
to
the
practical
fairly
well
i
shall
never
go
into
the
house
on
my
own
account
but
there
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
being
in
the
thick
of
public
movements
i
not
cut
out
for
debate
should
lose
my
temper
and
tell
disagreeable
truths
which
would
do
you
know
but
behind
the
scenes
it
is
bad
in
a
way
a
longer
pause
obliged
godwin
to
speak
of
himself
life
is
less
exciting
for
years
i
have
worked
in
a
manufacturing
laboratory
at
rotherhithe
science
has
carried
the
day
with
you
after
all
it
used
to
be
very
doubtful
this
was
a
kind
and
pleasant
way
of
interpreting
necessity
godwin
felt
grateful
and
added
with
a
smile
do
think
i
shall
stick
to
it
much
longer
for
one
thing
i
am
sick
of
town
perhaps
i
shall
travel
for
a
year
or
two
perhaps
i
in
a
state
of
transition
to
tell
the
truth
buckland
revolved
this
information
his
face
told
that
he
found
it
slightly
puzzling
once
had
thoughts
of
literature
given
up
would
perhaps
revive
them
but
i
think
not
they
were
now
quitting
the
town
and
peak
unwilling
to
appear
before
strangers
in
a
state
of
profuse
perspiration
again
moderated
his
friend
speed
they
began
to
talk
about
the
surrounding
country
a
theme
which
occupied
them
until
the
house
was
reached
with
heart
godwin
found
himself
at
the
gate
by
which
he
had
already
twice
passed
secure
in
the
decency
of
his
apparel
and
no
longer
oppressed
by
bashfulness
he
would
have
gone
joyously
forward
but
for
the
dread
of
a
possible
ridiculous
association
which
his
name
might
revive
in
the
thoughts
of
and
warricombe
yet
buckland
who
had
no
lack
of
kindly
feeling
would
hardly
have
brought
him
here
had
the
reception
which
awaited
him
been
at
all
dubious
we
do
come
across
anyone
said
warricombe
go
straight
up
to
my
room
but
the
way
was
not
clear
within
the
beautiful
old
porch
sat
sidwell
warricombe
and
her
friend
of
the
striking
countenance
whom
godwin
now
knew
as
miss
moorhouse
buckland
addressed
his
sister
in
a
tone
of
lively
pleasure
do
you
think
i
have
met
and
brought
home
with
me
here
is
my
old
friend
godwin
peak
under
the
two
pairs
of
female
eyes
godwin
kept
a
calm
if
rather
stern
face
should
have
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
mr
peak
said
sidwell
holding
out
her
hand
was
the
meeting
quite
by
chance
to
godwin
himself
the
question
was
of
course
directed
with
a
look
of
smiling
interest
such
welcome
as
could
not
have
been
improved
upon
she
listened
to
his
reply
then
presented
him
to
miss
moorhouse
a
slight
languor
in
her
movements
and
her
voice
together
with
the
beautiful
coldness
of
her
complexion
made
it
probable
that
she
did
not
share
the
exuberant
health
manifest
in
her
two
brothers
she
conversed
with
mature
yet
showed
a
slight
tendency
to
abstractedness
on
being
addressed
she
regarded
the
speaker
steadily
for
an
instant
before
shaping
her
answer
which
always
however
trifling
the
subject
seemed
carefully
worded
in
these
few
moments
of
dialogue
godwin
reached
the
conclusion
that
sidwell
had
not
much
sense
of
humour
but
that
the
delicacy
of
her
mind
was
unsurpassable
in
miss
moorhouse
there
was
no
defect
of
refinement
but
her
conversation
struck
a
note
of
sprightliness
at
once
more
energetic
and
more
subtle
than
is
often
found
in
english
girls
thus
though
at
times
she
looked
so
young
that
it
might
be
doubted
whether
she
had
long
been
out
of
her
teens
at
others
one
suspected
her
older
than
sidwell
the
friends
happened
to
be
as
nearly
as
possible
of
an
age
which
was
verging
to
when
he
spoke
to
miss
moorhouse
buckland
frank
tone
subdued
itself
he
watched
her
face
with
reverent
attention
smiled
when
she
smiled
and
joined
in
her
laughter
with
less
than
his
usual
volume
of
sound
in
acuteness
he
was
obviously
inferior
to
her
and
there
were
moments
when
he
betrayed
some
nervousness
under
her
rejoinders
all
this
was
matter
of
observation
for
peak
who
had
learnt
to
exercise
his
discernment
even
whilst
attending
to
the
proprieties
the
sounding
of
the
first
left
the
young
men
free
to
go
upstairs
when
at
length
they
presented
themselves
in
the
warricombe
and
her
younger
daughter
sat
there
alone
the
greeting
of
his
hostess
did
not
quite
satisfy
godwin
though
it
was
sufficiently
courteous
he
remembered
that
ten
years
ago
warricombe
had
appeared
to
receive
him
with
some
restraint
and
his
sensation
in
renewing
her
acquaintance
was
one
of
dislike
but
in
a
moment
the
master
of
the
house
joined
them
and
no
visitor
could
have
had
a
more
kindly
welcome
than
that
he
offered
to
his
son
friend
with
genial
tact
warricombe
ignored
the
interval
since
his
last
conversation
with
godwin
and
spoke
as
if
this
visit
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
you
already
know
the
country
about
exeter
have
seen
very
little
of
it
yet
then
we
must
show
you
our
points
of
view
our
own
garden
offers
a
glimpse
of
the
and
a
good
prospect
of
haldon
the
ridge
beyond
the
exe
but
there
are
many
much
better
points
within
easy
reach
you
are
in
no
hurry
i
hope
louis
warricombe
and
miss
moorhouse
brother
were
away
on
a
long
walk
they
did
not
return
for
lunch
godwin
was
glad
of
this
for
time
had
wrought
the
change
in
him
that
he
felt
more
at
ease
in
female
society
than
under
the
eyes
of
young
men
whose
social
position
inclined
them
to
criticism
the
meal
proved
as
delightful
as
luncheon
is
wont
to
be
in
a
luxurious
when
brilliant
sunshine
gleams
on
the
foliage
visible
from
windows
and
the
warmth
of
the
season
sanctions
clear
colours
in
costume
the
talk
was
wholly
of
country
pleasures
it
afforded
the
visitor
no
little
satisfaction
to
be
able
to
make
known
his
acquaintance
with
parts
of
england
to
which
the
warricombes
had
not
penetrated
godwin
learnt
that
the
family
were
insular
in
their
tastes
a
mention
by
miss
moorhouse
of
continental
scenes
led
the
host
to
avow
a
strong
preference
for
his
own
country
under
whatever
aspect
and
sidwell
murmured
her
sympathy
no
less
introspective
than
in
the
old
days
though
he
could
better
command
his
muscles
peak
after
each
of
his
short
remarks
made
comparison
of
his
tone
and
phraseology
with
those
of
the
other
speakers
had
he
still
any
marks
of
the
ignoble
world
from
which
he
sprang
any
defect
of
pronunciation
any
native
awkwardness
of
utterance
impossible
to
judge
himself
infallibly
but
he
was
conscious
of
no
vulgar
mannerism
though
it
was
so
long
since
he
left
whitelaw
the
accent
of
certain
of
the
professors
still
remained
with
him
as
an
example
when
endeavouring
to
be
graceful
he
was
wont
to
hear
the
voice
of
dr
nares
or
of
professor
barber
who
lectured
on
english
literature
more
recently
he
had
been
observant
of
christian
speech
which
had
a
languid
elegance
worth
imitating
in
certain
particulars
buckland
warricombe
was
rather
a
careless
talker
but
it
was
the
carelessness
of
a
man
who
had
never
needed
to
reflect
on
such
a
matter
the
refinement
of
whose
enunciation
was
assured
to
him
from
the
nursery
that
now
was
a
thing
to
be
aimed
at
preciseness
must
be
avoided
for
in
a
young
man
it
seemed
to
argue
conscious
effort
a
loose
sentence
now
and
then
a
colloquialism
substituted
for
the
more
grammatical
phrase
heaven
be
thanked
that
he
was
unconcerned
on
the
point
of
garb
inferiority
in
that
respect
would
have
been
fatal
to
his
ease
his
clothes
were
not
too
new
and
in
quality
were
such
as
he
had
the
habit
of
wearing
the
warricombes
must
have
immediately
detected
any
pretentiousness
were
it
but
in
a
necktie
that
would
impress
them
more
unfavourably
than
signs
of
poverty
but
he
defied
inspection
not
sidwell
herself
doubtless
sensitive
in
the
highest
degree
could
conceive
a
prejudice
against
him
on
this
account
his
misgivings
were
overcome
if
these
people
were
acquainted
with
the
joke
it
certainly
did
not
affect
their
behaviour
to
him
and
he
could
hope
by
the
force
of
his
personality
to
obliterate
from
their
minds
such
disagreeable
thoughts
as
they
might
secretly
entertain
surely
he
could
make
good
his
claim
to
be
deemed
a
gentleman
to
buckland
he
had
declared
his
position
and
no
shame
attached
to
it
a
man
of
scientific
tastes
like
warricombe
must
consider
it
respectable
enough
grant
him
a
little
time
and
why
should
he
not
become
a
recognised
friend
of
this
family
if
he
were
but
resident
in
exeter
for
the
first
time
he
lost
himself
in
abstraction
and
only
an
inquiry
from
sidwell
recalled
him
have
seen
the
cathedral
mr
peak
yes
i
attended
service
there
yesterday
morning
had
he
reflected
perhaps
he
would
not
have
added
this
circumstance
even
in
speaking
he
suffered
a
confused
doubtfulness
but
as
soon
as
the
words
were
uttered
he
felt
strangely
glad
sidwell
bestowed
upon
him
an
unmistakable
look
of
approval
her
mother
gazed
with
colder
interest
warricombe
regarded
him
and
mused
buckland
a
smile
of
peculiar
meaning
on
his
close
lips
glanced
from
him
to
miss
moorhouse
then
you
heard
canon
grayling
remarked
the
father
of
the
family
with
something
in
his
tone
which
answered
to
sidwell
facial
expression
did
you
like
his
sermon
godwin
was
trifling
with
a
pair
of
but
the
nervousness
evident
in
his
fingers
did
not
prevent
him
from
replying
with
a
natural
air
of
deliberation
was
especially
struck
with
the
passage
about
the
barren
the
words
might
have
expressed
a
truth
but
in
that
case
a
tone
of
sarcasm
must
have
winged
them
as
it
was
they
involved
either
hypocrisy
or
ungenerous
irony
at
the
expense
of
his
questioner
buckland
could
not
but
understand
them
in
the
latter
sense
his
face
darkened
at
that
moment
peak
met
his
eye
and
encountered
its
steady
searching
gaze
with
a
perfectly
calm
smile
pulsings
of
his
heart
violent
painful
and
the
fatal
hour
of
his
life
had
struck
had
he
to
say
about
it
buckland
asked
carelessly
peak
reply
was
one
of
those
remarkable
efforts
of
mind
one
might
say
of
character
which
are
sometimes
called
forth
without
premeditation
almost
without
consciousness
by
a
profound
moral
crisis
a
minute
or
two
ago
he
would
have
believed
it
impossible
to
recall
and
state
in
lucid
terms
the
arguments
to
which
as
he
sat
in
the
cathedral
he
had
barely
given
ear
he
remembered
vaguely
that
the
preacher
whose
name
he
knew
not
till
now
had
dwelt
for
a
few
moments
on
the
topic
indicated
but
at
the
time
he
was
indisposed
to
listen
seriously
and
what
chance
was
there
that
the
chain
of
thought
had
fixed
itself
in
his
memory
now
under
the
marvelling
regard
of
his
conscious
self
he
poured
forth
an
admirable
rendering
of
the
views
fuller
than
the
original
more
eloquent
more
subtle
for
five
minutes
he
held
his
hearers
in
absorbed
attention
even
buckland
bending
forward
with
an
air
of
genuine
interest
and
when
he
stopped
rather
suddenly
there
followed
a
silence
peak
said
the
host
after
a
cough
of
apology
have
made
that
clearer
to
me
than
it
was
yesterday
i
must
thank
you
godwin
felt
that
a
slight
bow
of
acknowledgment
was
perhaps
called
for
but
not
a
muscle
would
obey
his
will
he
was
enervated
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
the
most
severe
physical
effort
could
not
have
reduced
him
to
a
feebler
state
sidwell
was
speaking
peak
has
developed
what
canon
grayling
only
suggested
brilliant
effort
of
exegesis
exclaimed
buckland
with
a
laugh
again
the
young
men
exchanged
looks
godwin
smiled
as
one
might
under
a
sentence
of
death
as
for
the
other
his
suspicion
had
vanished
and
he
now
gave
way
to
frank
amusement
luncheon
was
over
and
by
a
general
movement
all
went
forth
on
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
warricombe
even
more
cordial
than
hitherto
named
to
godwin
the
features
of
the
extensive
landscape
you
see
that
the
view
is
in
a
measure
spoilt
by
the
growth
of
the
city
a
few
years
ago
none
of
those
ugly
little
houses
stood
in
the
a
few
years
hence
i
fear
there
will
be
much
more
to
complain
of
i
daresay
you
know
all
about
the
the
story
of
the
countess
and
so
forth
buckland
presently
suggested
that
the
afternoon
might
be
used
for
a
drive
was
about
to
propose
it
said
his
father
might
start
by
the
stoke
canon
road
so
as
to
let
mr
peak
have
the
famous
view
from
the
gate
then
go
on
towards
silverton
for
the
sake
of
the
reversed
prospect
from
the
exe
who
shall
be
of
the
party
it
was
decided
that
four
only
should
occupy
the
vehicle
miss
moorhouse
and
fanny
warricombe
to
be
the
two
ladies
godwin
regretted
omission
but
the
friendly
informality
of
the
arrangement
delighted
him
when
the
carriage
rolled
softly
from
the
gravelled
drive
buckland
holding
the
reins
he
felt
an
animation
such
as
no
event
had
ever
produced
in
him
no
longer
did
he
calculate
phrases
a
spontaneous
aptness
marked
his
dialogue
with
miss
moorhouse
and
the
laughing
words
he
now
and
then
addressed
to
fanny
for
a
short
time
buckland
was
laconic
but
at
length
he
entered
into
the
joyous
tone
of
the
occasion
earwaker
would
have
stood
in
amazement
could
he
have
seen
and
heard
the
saturnine
denizen
of
peckham
rye
the
weather
was
superb
a
mitigated
the
warmth
of
the
cloudless
sun
and
where
a
dark
rose
against
the
sky
it
gave
the
azure
depths
a
magnificence
unfamiliar
to
northern
eyes
such
a
day
as
this
remarked
miss
moorhouse
dividing
her
look
between
buckland
and
his
friend
feels
that
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
england
for
the
vile
weather
was
warricombe
reply
would
know
such
enjoyment
i
ca
agree
with
that
for
a
moment
my
capacity
for
enjoyment
is
unlimited
that
philosophy
is
unworthy
of
you
it
belongs
to
a
paltry
scheme
called
making
the
best
of
things
which
you
excel
miss
moorhouse
she
does
agreed
fanny
a
laughing
maiden
deny
it
no
one
is
more
copious
in
railing
against
circumstances
you
turn
them
all
to
a
joke
fanny
objected
my
profound
pessimism
i
am
misunderstood
no
one
expects
irony
from
a
woman
peak
found
it
difficult
not
to
gaze
too
persistently
at
the
subtle
countenance
he
was
impelled
to
examine
it
by
a
consciousness
that
he
himself
received
a
large
share
of
miss
moorhouse
attention
and
a
doubt
as
to
the
estimation
in
which
she
held
him
canon
sermon
and
godwin
comment
had
elicited
no
remark
from
her
did
she
belong
to
the
ranks
of
emancipated
women
with
his
experience
of
marcella
moxey
he
welcomed
the
possibility
of
this
variation
of
the
type
but
at
the
same
time
in
obedience
to
a
new
spirit
that
had
strange
possession
of
him
recognised
that
such
phenomena
no
longer
aroused
his
personal
interest
by
the
oddest
of
intellectual
processes
he
had
placed
himself
altogether
outside
the
sphere
of
unorthodox
spirits
concerning
miss
moorhouse
he
cared
only
for
the
report
she
might
make
of
him
to
the
warricombes
before
long
the
carriage
was
stopped
that
he
might
enjoy
one
of
the
pleasantest
views
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
a
gate
interrupting
a
high
bank
with
which
the
road
was
bordered
gave
admission
to
the
head
of
a
great
cultivated
slope
which
fell
to
the
river
exe
hence
was
suddenly
revealed
a
wide
panorama
three
valleys
those
of
the
creedy
the
exe
and
the
culm
spread
their
rural
loveliness
to
remote
points
of
the
horizon
gentle
undulations
with
pasture
and
woodland
with
long
winding
roads
and
many
a
farm
that
gleamed
white
amid
its
orchard
leafage
led
the
gaze
into
regions
of
evanescent
hue
and
outline
westward
a
bolder
swell
pointed
to
the
skirts
of
dartmoor
no
inappropriate
detail
disturbed
the
impression
exeter
was
wholly
hidden
behind
the
hill
on
which
the
observers
stood
and
the
line
of
railway
leading
thither
could
only
be
descried
by
special
search
a
foaming
weir
at
the
hill
foot
blended
its
soft
murmur
with
that
of
the
fir
branches
hereabouts
else
no
sound
that
the
air
could
convey
beyond
the
pulsing
of
a
bird
note
all
had
alighted
and
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
silence
when
peak
had
received
such
geographical
instruction
as
was
needful
warricombe
pointed
out
to
him
a
mansion
conspicuous
on
the
opposite
slope
of
the
exe
valley
the
seat
of
sir
stafford
northcote
the
house
had
no
architectural
beauty
but
its
solitary
lordship
amid
green
pastures
and
tracts
of
thick
wood
declared
the
graces
and
privileges
of
ancestral
wealth
standing
here
alone
godwin
would
have
surveyed
these
possessions
of
an
english
aristocrat
with
more
or
less
bitterness
envy
would
for
a
moment
at
all
events
have
perturbed
his
pleasure
in
the
natural
scene
accompanied
as
he
was
his
emotion
took
a
form
which
indeed
was
allied
to
envy
but
had
nothing
painful
he
exulted
in
the
prerogatives
of
birth
and
opulence
felt
proud
of
hereditary
pride
gloried
that
his
mind
was
capable
of
appreciating
to
the
full
those
distinctions
which
by
the
vulgar
are
not
so
much
as
suspected
admitted
to
equal
converse
with
men
and
women
who
represented
the
best
in
english
society
he
could
cast
away
the
evil
grudge
the
fierce
spirit
of
and
be
what
nature
had
proposed
in
endowing
him
with
large
brain
generous
blood
delicate
tissues
what
room
for
malignancy
he
was
accepted
by
his
peers
and
could
regard
with
tolerance
even
those
ignoble
orders
of
mankind
amid
whom
he
had
so
long
dwelt
unrecognised
a
bee
hummed
past
him
and
this
sound
of
all
the
voices
of
nature
that
which
most
intenerates
filled
his
heart
to
overflowing
moisture
made
his
eyes
dim
and
at
the
impulse
of
a
feeling
of
gratitude
such
as
only
the
subtlest
care
of
psychology
could
fully
have
explained
he
turned
to
buckland
saying
for
my
meeting
with
you
i
should
have
had
a
lonely
and
not
very
cheerful
holiday
i
owe
you
a
great
deal
warricombe
laughed
but
as
an
englishman
does
when
he
wishes
to
avoid
show
of
emotion
am
very
glad
indeed
that
we
did
meet
stay
with
us
over
tomorrow
i
only
wish
i
were
not
obliged
to
go
to
london
on
look
fanny
is
that
a
hawk
over
cowley
bridge
you
feel
you
would
like
to
shoot
it
asked
miss
moorhouse
who
a
moment
ago
had
very
closely
examined
peak
face
shoot
it
why
do
you
ask
that
that
you
felt
the
desire
man
does
replied
buckland
he
has
had
a
moment
to
recover
himself
that
the
human
instinct
male
human
instinct
thank
you
for
your
honesty
they
drove
on
and
by
a
wide
circuit
occasionally
stopping
for
the
view
returned
to
the
old
tiverton
road
and
so
home
by
this
time
louis
warricombe
and
moorhouse
were
back
from
their
walk
reposing
in
the
company
of
the
ladies
they
had
partaken
of
such
refreshments
as
are
lawful
at
five
and
now
welcomed
with
vivacity
the
later
arrivals
moorhouse
was
something
older
than
buckland
a
man
with
forehead
and
eyes
expressive
of
much
intelligence
till
of
late
he
had
been
a
cambridge
tutor
but
was
now
privately
occupied
in
mathematical
pursuits
louis
warricombe
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
what
profession
to
follow
and
to
aid
the
process
of
resolve
had
for
the
present
devoted
himself
to
physical
exercise
in
hand
godwin
seated
himself
by
sidwell
who
began
by
inquiring
how
the
drive
had
pleased
him
the
fervour
of
his
reply
caused
her
to
smile
with
special
graciousness
and
their
conversation
was
uninterrupted
for
some
minutes
then
fanny
came
forward
with
a
book
of
mosses
her
own
collection
which
she
had
mentioned
to
peak
as
they
were
talking
together
in
the
carriage
you
make
special
study
of
any
science
sidwell
asked
when
certain
remarks
of
godwin
had
proved
his
familiarity
with
the
things
he
was
inspecting
is
long
since
i
worked
seriously
at
anything
of
the
kind
he
answered
adding
in
a
moment
at
chemistry
that
only
because
it
is
my
business
or
inorganic
chemistry
inquired
fanny
with
the
promptness
of
a
schoolgirl
who
wishes
to
have
it
known
that
her
ideas
are
no
longer
vague
for
the
most
part
godwin
replied
smiling
at
her
of
the
most
disagreeable
kind
sidwell
reflected
then
put
another
question
but
with
some
diffidence
think
you
were
once
fond
of
geology
it
was
the
first
allusion
to
that
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
ten
years
ago
peak
succeeded
in
meeting
her
look
with
steadiness
i
still
like
it
collections
have
been
much
improved
since
you
saw
them
at
thornhaw
hope
warricombe
will
let
me
see
them
buckland
came
up
and
made
an
apology
for
drawing
his
friend
aside
you
let
us
send
for
your
traps
you
may
just
as
well
have
a
room
here
for
a
night
or
two
perpetually
imagining
some
kind
chance
that
might
associate
him
with
civilised
people
godwin
could
not
even
pack
his
portmanteau
for
a
ramble
to
land
end
without
stowing
away
a
dress
suit
he
was
thus
saved
what
would
have
been
an
embarrassment
of
special
annoyance
without
hesitation
he
accepted
buckland
offer
and
named
the
hotel
at
which
the
luggage
was
deposited
right
the
messenger
shall
explain
our
name
well
enough
known
to
them
if
you
would
like
to
look
up
my
father
in
his
study
he
be
delighted
to
go
over
his
collections
with
you
you
still
care
for
that
kind
of
thing
certainly
how
can
you
doubt
it
buckland
smiled
and
gave
no
other
reply
fanny
to
show
you
the
way
when
you
care
to
go
and
he
left
the
room
chapter
iv
sidwell
had
fallen
into
conversation
with
moorhouse
miss
moorhouse
warricombe
and
louis
were
grouped
in
animated
talk
observing
that
fanny
threw
glances
towards
him
from
a
lonely
corner
peak
went
over
to
her
and
was
pleased
with
the
smile
he
met
fanny
had
watched
eyes
much
brighter
than
sidwell
her
youthful
vivacity
blended
with
an
odd
little
fashion
of
schoolgirl
pedantry
in
a
very
piquant
way
godwin
attempts
at
conversation
with
her
were
rather
awkward
he
found
it
difficult
to
strike
the
suitable
note
something
not
too
formal
yet
not
deficient
in
respect
you
think
he
asked
presently
i
should
disturb
your
father
if
i
went
to
him
not
at
all
i
often
go
and
sit
in
the
study
at
this
time
you
show
me
the
way
fanny
at
once
rose
and
together
they
crossed
the
hall
passed
through
a
sort
of
anteroom
connecting
with
a
fernery
and
came
to
the
study
door
a
tap
was
answered
by
cheerful
summons
and
fanny
looked
in
my
ladybird
ah
you
are
bringing
mr
peak
come
in
come
in
it
was
a
large
and
beautiful
room
its
wide
windows
in
a
cushioned
recess
looking
upon
the
lawn
where
the
yew
tree
cast
solemn
shade
one
wall
presented
an
unbroken
array
of
volumes
their
livery
sober
but
handsome
detached
bookcases
occupied
other
portions
of
the
irregular
perimeter
cabinets
closed
and
open
were
arranged
with
due
regard
to
convenience
above
the
mantelpiece
hung
a
few
small
photographs
but
the
at
disposal
was
chiefly
occupied
with
objects
which
illustrated
warricombe
scientific
tastes
on
a
stand
in
the
light
of
the
window
gleamed
two
elaborate
microscopes
provocative
of
enthusiasm
in
a
mind
such
as
godwin
in
a
few
minutes
fanny
silently
retired
her
father
by
no
means
forward
to
speak
of
himself
and
his
pursuits
was
led
in
that
direction
by
peak
expressions
of
interest
and
the
two
were
soon
busied
with
matters
which
had
a
charm
for
both
a
collection
of
elvans
formed
the
and
when
they
had
entered
upon
the
wide
field
of
palaeontology
it
was
natural
for
warricombe
to
invite
his
attention
to
the
species
of
which
he
had
had
the
happiness
of
identifying
some
ten
years
ago
a
discovery
now
recognised
and
chronicled
though
his
sympathy
was
genuine
enough
godwin
struggled
against
an
uneasy
sense
of
manifesting
excessive
appreciation
never
oblivious
of
himself
he
could
not
utter
the
simplest
phrase
of
admiration
without
criticising
its
justice
its
tone
and
at
present
it
behoved
him
to
bear
in
mind
that
he
was
conversing
with
no
sciolist
mr
warricombe
obviously
had
his
share
of
human
weakness
but
he
was
at
once
a
gentleman
and
a
student
of
mind
insincerity
must
be
very
careful
if
it
would
not
jar
upon
his
refined
ear
so
godwin
often
checked
himself
in
the
utterance
of
what
might
sound
too
much
like
flattery
a
young
man
talking
with
one
much
older
a
poor
man
in
dialogue
with
a
wealthy
must
under
any
circumstances
guard
his
speech
for
one
of
aggressive
idiosyncrasy
the
task
of
discretion
had
peculiar
difficulties
and
the
attitude
he
had
assumed
at
luncheon
still
further
complicated
the
operations
of
his
mind
only
at
moments
could
he
speak
in
his
true
voice
and
silence
meant
for
the
most
part
a
studious
repression
of
much
he
would
naturally
have
uttered
resurgent
envy
gave
him
no
little
trouble
on
entering
the
room
he
could
not
but
exclaim
to
himself
easy
for
a
man
to
do
notable
work
amid
such
surroundings
if
i
were
but
thus
equipped
for
investigation
and
as
often
as
his
eyes
left
a
particular
object
to
make
a
general
survey
the
same
thought
burned
in
him
he
feared
lest
it
should
be
legible
on
his
countenance
taking
a
pamphlet
from
the
table
warricombe
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
inquired
whether
peak
read
german
the
answer
being
affirmative
he
rejoined
could
hardly
have
neglected
so
important
a
language
i
unfortunately
did
learn
it
in
my
youth
and
i
have
never
had
perseverance
enough
to
struggle
with
it
since
something
led
me
to
take
down
this
brochure
the
other
day
an
old
attempt
of
mine
to
write
about
the
weathering
of
rocks
it
was
printed
in
and
no
sooner
had
it
seen
the
light
than
friends
of
mine
wanted
to
know
what
i
meant
by
appropriating
without
acknowledgement
certain
facts
quite
recently
pointed
out
by
professor
pfaff
of
erlangen
unhappily
professor
pfaff
results
were
quite
unknown
to
me
and
i
had
to
get
them
translated
the
coincidences
sure
enough
were
very
noticeable
just
before
you
came
in
i
was
reviving
that
old
discomfiture
peak
in
glancing
over
the
pages
murmured
with
a
smile
qui
ante
nos
nostra
so
exclaimed
warricombe
laughing
with
a
subdued
heartiness
which
was
one
of
his
pleasant
characteristics
and
after
a
pause
he
inquired
you
find
any
time
to
keep
up
your
classics
fits
and
starts
sometimes
i
return
to
them
for
a
month
or
two
it
pretty
much
the
same
with
me
here
on
my
table
for
instance
lies
tacitus
i
found
it
mentioned
not
long
ago
that
the
first
sentence
of
the
is
a
hexameter
did
you
know
it
and
when
i
had
once
got
hold
of
the
book
i
thought
it
a
shabby
thing
to
return
it
to
the
dust
of
its
shelf
without
reading
at
least
a
few
pages
so
i
have
gone
on
from
day
to
day
with
no
little
enjoyment
buckland
as
you
probably
know
regards
these
old
fellows
with
scorn
always
differed
about
that
ca
quite
decide
whether
he
is
still
sincere
in
all
he
says
about
them
time
i
suspect
is
mellowing
his
judgment
they
moved
to
the
shelves
where
greek
and
latin
books
stood
in
serried
order
and
only
the
warning
put
an
end
to
their
sympathetic
discussion
of
the
place
such
authors
should
hold
in
modern
educational
systems
they
shown
you
your
room
warricombe
asked
but
as
he
spoke
the
face
of
his
eldest
son
appeared
at
the
door
traps
have
safely
arrived
peak
the
bedroom
to
which
godwin
was
conducted
had
a
delicious
fragrance
of
source
indeterminable
when
he
had
closed
the
door
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
looking
about
him
it
was
his
first
experience
of
the
upper
chambers
of
houses
such
as
this
merely
to
step
upon
the
carpet
fluttered
his
senses
merely
to
breathe
the
air
was
a
purification
luxury
of
the
rational
kind
dictated
by
regard
for
health
of
body
and
soul
appeared
in
every
detail
on
the
walls
were
scenery
of
devon
and
cornwall
a
hanging
held
about
a
score
of
volumes
poets
essayists
novelists
elsewhere
not
too
prominent
lay
a
bible
and
a
he
dressed
as
never
before
with
leisurely
enjoyment
of
the
process
when
the
mirror
declared
him
ready
his
eyes
returned
frequently
to
an
inspection
of
the
figure
he
presented
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
unworthy
to
take
his
place
at
the
as
for
his
visage
might
he
not
console
himself
with
the
assurance
that
it
was
of
no
common
stamp
i
met
that
man
in
a
room
i
should
be
curious
about
him
i
should
see
at
once
that
he
did
belong
to
the
vulgar
i
should
desire
to
hear
him
speak
and
the
warricombes
were
not
lacking
in
discernment
he
would
compare
more
than
favourably
with
moorhouse
whose
aspect
bright
and
agreeable
enough
made
no
promise
of
it
must
be
time
to
go
down
he
left
the
room
with
an
air
of
grave
at
dinner
he
was
careful
to
attempt
no
repetition
of
the
display
which
had
done
very
well
at
luncheon
it
must
not
be
thought
that
he
had
the
habit
of
talking
for
effect
warricombe
unless
he
mistook
had
begun
to
view
him
more
favourably
her
remarks
made
less
distinction
between
him
and
the
other
guests
but
he
could
not
like
his
hostess
he
thought
her
unworthy
to
be
the
mother
of
sidwell
and
fanny
of
buckland
and
louis
there
was
a
marked
strain
of
the
commonplace
in
her
the
girls
costumed
for
the
evening
affected
him
with
a
return
of
the
awe
he
had
all
but
overcome
sidwell
was
exquisite
in
dark
colours
her
sister
in
white
miss
moorhouse
addressed
by
her
friends
as
looked
older
than
in
the
and
had
lost
something
of
her
animation
possibly
the
country
routine
had
begun
to
weary
her
a
little
peak
was
at
a
vast
distance
from
the
hour
which
saw
him
alight
at
exeter
and
begin
his
ramble
about
the
city
he
no
longer
felt
himself
alone
in
the
world
impossible
to
revive
the
mood
in
which
he
deliberately
planned
to
consume
his
economies
in
a
year
or
two
of
desert
wandering
far
other
were
the
anticipations
which
warmed
his
mind
when
the
repose
attuned
him
to
unwonted
hopefulness
this
family
were
henceforth
his
friends
and
it
depended
only
upon
himself
to
make
the
connection
lasting
with
all
manner
of
benefits
easily
imagined
established
in
the
country
the
warricombes
stood
to
him
in
quite
a
different
relation
from
any
that
could
have
arisen
had
he
met
with
them
in
london
there
he
would
have
been
nothing
more
than
a
casual
welcomed
for
the
hour
and
all
but
forgotten
when
he
had
said
for
years
he
had
understood
that
london
offered
him
no
prospect
of
social
advancement
but
a
night
passed
under
this
roof
practically
raised
him
to
a
level
whence
he
surveyed
a
rich
field
of
possible
conquest
with
the
genial
geologist
he
felt
himself
on
excellent
terms
and
much
of
this
was
ascribable
to
a
singular
chance
which
had
masked
his
real
being
and
represented
him
with
scarce
an
effort
of
his
own
in
a
light
peculiarly
attractive
to
warricombe
he
was
now
playing
the
conscious
hypocrite
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
face
and
accept
but
the
fault
was
not
his
fate
had
brought
it
about
at
all
events
he
aimed
at
no
vulgar
profit
his
one
desire
was
for
human
fellowship
he
sought
nothing
but
that
solace
which
every
code
of
morals
has
deemed
legitimate
let
the
society
which
compelled
to
such
an
expedient
bear
the
burden
of
its
shame
that
must
indeed
have
been
a
circle
of
great
intellects
amid
which
godwin
peak
felt
himself
subordinate
he
had
never
known
that
impression
and
in
the
warricombe
family
was
no
one
whom
he
could
regard
even
as
his
equal
buckland
doubtless
had
some
knowledge
of
the
world
and
could
boast
of
a
free
mind
but
he
lacked
subtlety
a
psychological
problem
would
easily
puzzle
him
attainments
were
respectable
but
what
could
be
said
of
a
man
who
had
devoted
his
life
to
geology
and
still
in
the
year
remained
an
orthodox
member
of
the
church
of
england
godwin
as
he
sat
in
the
and
enjoyed
its
atmosphere
of
refinement
sincerely
held
himself
of
far
more
account
as
an
intellectual
being
than
all
the
persons
about
him
but
if
his
brain
must
dwell
in
solitude
his
heart
might
compass
worthy
alliances
the
thing
most
needful
to
humanity
one
may
find
the
associates
of
his
intellect
in
libraries
the
friend
of
one
emotions
must
walk
in
flesh
and
blood
earwaker
moxey
these
were
in
many
respects
admirable
fellows
and
he
had
no
little
love
for
them
but
the
world
they
represented
was
womanless
and
so
of
flagrant
imperfection
of
marcella
moxey
he
could
not
think
emotionally
indeed
she
emphasised
by
her
personality
the
lack
which
caused
his
suffering
sidwell
warricombe
suggested
more
completely
than
any
woman
he
had
yet
observed
that
companionship
without
which
life
must
to
the
end
taste
bitter
his
interest
in
her
was
not
strictly
personal
she
moved
and
spoke
before
him
as
a
typical
woman
not
as
the
daughter
of
martin
warricombe
and
the
sister
of
buckland
here
at
last
opened
to
his
view
that
sphere
of
female
society
which
he
had
known
as
remotely
existing
the
desperate
aim
of
ambition
conventional
women
but
was
not
the
phrase
tautological
in
the
few
females
who
have
liberated
their
souls
was
not
much
of
the
woman
inevitably
sacrificed
and
would
it
not
be
so
for
long
years
to
come
on
the
other
hand
such
a
one
as
sidwell
might
be
held
a
perfect
creature
perfect
in
relation
to
a
certain
stage
of
human
development
look
at
her
as
she
sat
conversing
with
moorhouse
soft
upon
her
face
compare
her
on
the
one
hand
with
an
average
emancipated
girl
on
the
other
with
a
daughter
of
the
people
how
unsatisfying
was
the
former
the
latter
how
repulsive
here
one
had
the
exquisite
mean
the
lady
as
england
has
perfected
her
towards
the
close
of
this
nineteenth
century
a
being
of
marvellous
delicacy
of
purest
instincts
of
unsurpassable
sweetness
who
could
not
detail
her
limitations
obvious
and
in
certain
moods
irritating
enough
these
were
nothing
to
the
point
unless
one
would
roam
the
world
a
hungry
idealist
and
godwin
was
weary
of
the
famined
pilgrimage
the
murmur
of
amiable
voices
softened
him
to
the
reception
of
all
that
was
good
in
his
present
surroundings
and
justified
in
the
light
of
sentiment
his
own
dishonour
this
english
home
was
it
not
surely
the
best
result
of
civilisation
in
an
age
devoted
to
material
progress
here
was
peace
here
was
scope
for
the
kindliest
emotions
upon
him
the
born
rebel
the
scorner
of
average
mankind
the
consummate
egoist
this
atmosphere
exercised
an
influence
more
tranquillising
more
beneficent
than
even
the
mood
of
disinterested
study
in
the
world
to
which
sincerity
would
condemn
him
only
the
worst
elements
of
his
character
found
nourishment
and
range
here
he
was
humanised
made
receptive
of
all
gentle
sympathies
heroism
might
point
him
to
an
unending
struggle
with
adverse
conditions
but
how
was
heroism
possible
without
faith
absolute
faith
he
had
none
he
was
essentially
a
negativist
guided
by
the
mere
relations
of
phenomena
nothing
easier
than
to
contemn
the
mode
of
life
represented
by
this
wealthy
middle
class
but
compare
it
with
other
existences
conceivable
by
a
thinking
man
and
it
was
emphatically
good
it
aimed
at
placidity
at
benevolence
at
supreme
cleanliness
things
which
more
than
compensated
for
the
absence
of
higher
spirituality
we
can
be
but
what
we
are
these
people
accepted
themselves
and
in
so
doing
became
estimable
mortals
no
imbecile
pretensions
exposed
them
to
the
rebuke
of
a
social
satirist
no
vulgarity
tainted
their
familiar
intercourse
their
allegiance
to
a
creed
was
felt
as
an
added
grace
thus
only
could
their
souls
aspire
and
the
imperfect
poetry
of
their
natures
be
developed
he
took
an
opportunity
of
seating
himself
by
warricombe
with
whom
as
yet
he
had
held
no
continuous
dialogue
there
been
anything
of
interest
at
the
london
theatres
lately
she
asked
know
so
little
of
them
godwin
replied
truthfully
must
be
several
years
since
i
saw
a
play
in
that
respect
you
have
hardly
become
a
londoner
in
any
other
i
believe
said
peak
with
a
smile
have
lived
there
ten
years
but
am
far
from
regarding
london
as
my
home
i
hope
a
few
months
more
will
release
me
from
it
altogether
perhaps
you
think
of
leaving
england
should
be
very
sorry
to
do
that
for
any
length
of
time
my
wish
is
to
settle
somewhere
in
the
country
and
spend
a
year
or
two
in
quiet
study
warricombe
looked
amiable
surprise
but
corrected
herself
to
approving
interest
have
heard
some
of
our
friends
say
that
their
minds
get
unstrung
if
they
are
long
away
from
town
but
i
should
have
thought
that
country
quietness
would
be
much
better
than
london
noise
my
husband
certainly
finds
it
so
are
very
differently
constituted
said
godwin
then
it
depends
much
on
the
nature
of
one
work
uttering
these
commonplaces
with
an
air
of
reflection
he
observed
that
they
did
not
cost
him
the
which
was
wont
to
be
his
penalty
for
concession
to
the
terms
of
polite
gossip
rather
his
mind
accepted
with
gratitude
this
rare
repose
he
tasted
something
of
the
tranquil
which
makes
life
so
enjoyable
when
one
has
never
seen
a
necessity
for
shaping
original
remarks
no
one
in
this
room
would
despise
him
for
a
platitude
were
it
but
recommended
with
a
pleasant
smile
with
the
moxeys
with
earwaker
he
durst
not
thus
have
spoken
when
the
hour
of
separation
was
at
hand
buckland
invited
his
guest
to
retire
with
him
to
a
part
of
the
house
where
they
could
smoke
and
chat
comfortably
and
louis
are
fagged
after
their
twenty
mile
stretch
this
morning
i
have
caught
both
of
them
nodding
during
the
last
few
minutes
we
can
send
them
to
bed
without
apology
he
led
the
way
upstairs
to
a
region
of
whence
a
narrow
flight
of
steps
brought
them
into
a
octangular
and
with
pointed
tops
out
upon
the
roof
this
he
explained
had
been
built
some
twenty
years
ago
at
a
time
when
warricombe
amused
himself
with
photography
a
few
indications
of
its
original
purposes
were
still
noticeable
an
easel
and
a
box
of
showed
that
someone
doubtless
of
the
younger
generation
had
used
it
as
a
a
settee
and
deep
cane
chairs
made
it
an
inviting
lounge
on
a
warm
evening
like
the
present
when
by
throwing
open
a
hinged
wall
one
looked
forth
into
the
deep
sky
and
tasted
the
air
from
the
sea
used
to
paint
a
little
said
buckland
as
his
companion
bent
to
examine
a
small
canvas
on
which
a
landscape
was
roughed
in
it
lay
on
a
side
table
and
was
half
concealed
by
an
ordnance
map
left
unfolded
the
last
year
or
two
i
think
she
has
given
it
up
afraid
we
are
not
strong
in
matters
of
art
neither
of
the
girls
can
play
very
well
though
of
course
they
both
tinkle
for
their
own
amusement
maurice
the
poor
lad
who
was
killed
gave
a
good
deal
of
artistic
promise
father
keeps
some
little
of
his
which
men
in
that
line
have
praised
perhaps
sincerely
remember
you
used
to
speak
slightingly
of
art
said
godwin
as
he
took
an
offered
cigar
i
and
of
a
good
many
other
things
i
daresay
it
was
my
habit
at
one
time
i
believe
to
grow
heated
in
scorn
of
euclid
definitions
what
an
interesting
book
euclid
is
half
a
year
ago
i
was
led
by
a
talk
with
moorhouse
to
go
through
some
of
the
old
props
and
you
ca
imagine
how
they
delighted
me
moorhouse
was
so
obliging
as
to
tell
me
that
i
had
an
eminently
deductive
mind
he
laughed
but
not
without
betraying
some
pleasure
in
the
remark
he
went
on
very
little
such
a
mind
as
suggests
itself
in
common
conversation
he
is
really
profound
in
mathematics
a
man
of
original
powers
but
i
never
heard
him
make
a
remark
of
the
slightest
value
on
any
other
subject
now
his
sister
she
has
studied
nothing
in
particular
yet
she
ca
express
an
opinion
that
does
bear
the
stamp
of
originality
godwin
was
contented
to
muse
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
brilliant
star
in
the
western
heaven
only
one
inconsistency
in
her
that
annoys
and
puzzles
me
buckland
pursued
speaking
with
the
cigar
in
his
mouth
religion
she
seems
to
be
orthodox
true
we
have
never
spoken
on
the
subject
but
well
she
goes
to
church
and
carries
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
hypocrisy
is
the
last
thing
one
could
suspect
her
of
i
sure
she
hates
it
in
every
form
and
such
a
clear
brain
i
ca
understand
it
the
listener
was
still
he
had
allowed
his
cigar
after
the
first
few
puffs
to
smoulder
untasted
his
lips
were
drawn
into
an
expression
very
unlike
the
laxity
appropriate
to
pleasurable
smoking
when
the
murmur
of
the
pines
had
for
a
moment
been
audible
he
said
with
a
forced
smile
notice
you
take
for
granted
that
a
clear
brain
and
religious
orthodoxy
are
incompatible
the
other
gave
him
a
keen
look
was
buckland
reply
spoken
with
less
ingenuousness
of
tone
than
usual
say
that
miss
moorhouse
has
undeniably
a
strong
mind
and
that
it
is
impossible
to
suspect
her
of
the
slightest
hypocrisy
the
puzzle
that
keeps
you
occupied
rejoined
peak
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
assumption
of
superiority
though
the
accent
had
an
agreeable
softness
warricombe
moved
as
if
impatiently
struck
a
match
to
rekindle
his
weed
blew
tumultuous
clouds
and
finally
put
a
blunt
question
do
you
think
about
it
yourself
my
point
of
view
there
is
no
puzzle
at
all
godwin
replied
in
a
very
clear
voice
smiling
as
he
met
the
other
look
am
i
to
understand
that
asked
buckland
though
with
a
knitting
of
his
brows
as
a
doubt
of
miss
moorhouse
sincerity
i
ca
see
that
a
belief
in
the
christian
religion
is
excluded
by
any
degree
of
intellectual
clearness
your
views
have
changed
peak
many
subjects
this
among
them
see
the
words
fell
as
if
involuntarily
from
warricombe
lips
he
gazed
at
the
floor
awhile
then
suddenly
looking
up
exclaimed
would
be
civil
to
accept
this
without
surprise
but
it
is
too
much
for
me
how
has
it
come
about
would
take
me
a
long
time
to
explain
pursued
his
companion
watching
him
closely
were
quite
in
sympathy
with
that
exposition
you
gave
at
lunch
today
i
hope
there
was
nothing
in
my
way
of
speaking
that
made
you
think
otherwise
at
all
i
could
help
wondering
what
it
meant
you
seemed
perfectly
in
earnest
yet
such
talk
had
the
oddest
sound
on
your
lips
to
me
i
mean
of
course
i
thought
of
you
as
i
used
to
know
you
peak
was
now
in
an
attitude
of
repose
his
legs
crossed
thumb
and
forefinger
stroking
his
chin
could
very
well
turn
aside
to
comment
on
my
own
mental
history
here
again
was
the
note
of
something
like
genial
condescension
buckland
seemed
sensible
of
it
and
slightly
raised
his
eyebrows
am
to
understand
that
you
have
become
strictly
orthodox
in
matters
of
religious
faith
proof
is
replied
godwin
i
hope
before
long
to
take
orders
again
there
was
silence
and
again
the
made
its
whispering
in
the
pines
warricombe
with
a
sudden
gesture
pointed
towards
the
sky
shooting
star
one
of
the
brightest
i
ever
saw
missed
it
said
peak
just
glancing
in
that
direction
the
interruption
enabled
buckland
to
move
his
chair
in
this
new
position
he
was
somewhat
further
from
peak
and
had
a
better
view
of
his
face
should
never
have
imagined
you
a
clergyman
he
said
thoughtfully
i
can
see
that
your
mind
has
been
developing
powers
in
that
well
so
be
it
i
can
only
hope
you
have
found
your
true
work
in
life
you
doubt
it
ca
say
that
i
doubt
it
as
i
ca
understand
you
to
be
sure
we
have
been
parted
for
many
years
in
some
respects
i
must
seem
much
changed
changed
godwin
put
in
promptly
pursued
the
other
correctively
not
in
a
way
that
would
seem
incredible
to
anyone
whatever
i
am
conscious
of
growth
in
tolerance
but
my
attitude
in
essentials
is
unchanged
thinking
of
you
as
i
have
often
enough
done
i
always
kept
the
impression
you
made
on
me
when
we
were
both
lads
you
seemed
most
distinctly
a
modern
mind
one
of
the
most
modern
that
ever
came
under
my
notice
now
i
do
find
it
impossible
to
understand
my
father
when
he
reconciles
science
with
religion
he
was
born
sixty
years
ago
but
godwin
peak
as
a
a
supplied
peak
drily
as
a
parson
i
shall
have
to
meditate
much
before
i
grasp
the
notion
you
have
dropped
your
philosophical
studies
said
godwin
with
a
smile
of
courteous
interest
do
know
metaphysics
have
no
great
interest
for
me
but
i
philosophise
in
a
way
i
thought
myself
a
student
of
human
nature
at
all
events
you
have
kept
up
with
philosophical
speculation
on
the
points
involved
in
orthodox
religion
confess
my
ignorance
of
everything
of
the
kind
unless
you
include
bishop
blougram
among
the
philosophers
godwin
bore
the
gaze
which
accompanied
this
significant
inquiry
for
a
moment
he
smiled
but
there
followed
an
expression
of
gravity
touched
with
pain
had
thought
of
broaching
this
matter
he
said
with
slow
utterance
but
still
in
a
tone
of
perfect
friendliness
us
put
it
aside
warricombe
seemed
to
make
an
effort
and
his
next
words
had
the
accent
of
consideration
which
distinguished
his
ordinary
talk
forgive
my
bad
joke
i
merely
meant
that
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
argue
with
anyone
who
has
given
serious
attention
to
such
things
they
are
altogether
beyond
my
sphere
i
was
born
an
agnostic
and
no
subtlety
of
demonstration
could
incline
me
for
a
moment
to
theological
views
my
intellect
refuses
to
admit
a
single
preliminary
of
such
arguments
you
astonish
me
and
that
all
i
am
justified
in
saying
dear
warricombe
you
are
justified
in
saying
whatever
your
mind
suggests
that
is
one
of
the
principles
which
i
hold
unaltered
let
me
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
should
never
have
decided
upon
such
a
step
as
this
but
for
the
fact
that
i
have
managed
to
put
by
a
small
sum
of
money
which
will
make
me
independent
for
two
or
three
years
till
quite
lately
i
had
a
thought
of
using
my
freedom
in
this
way
it
was
clear
to
me
that
i
must
throw
over
the
old
drudgery
at
rotherhithe
but
this
resolve
which
astonishes
you
had
not
yet
ripened
i
saw
it
only
as
one
of
the
possibilities
of
my
life
well
now
it
only
too
true
that
there
something
of
speculation
in
my
purpose
i
look
to
the
church
not
only
as
a
congenial
sphere
of
activity
but
as
a
means
of
subsistence
in
a
man
of
no
fortune
this
is
inevitable
i
hope
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
even
if
the
conditions
of
the
case
allowed
it
i
should
present
myself
for
ordination
forthwith
i
must
study
and
prepare
myself
in
quietness
how
the
practical
details
will
be
arranged
i
ca
say
i
have
no
family
influence
and
i
must
hope
to
make
friends
who
will
open
a
way
for
me
i
have
always
lived
apart
from
society
but
that
is
natural
to
me
and
it
becomes
more
distasteful
the
older
i
grow
the
probability
is
that
i
shall
settle
somewhere
in
the
country
where
i
can
live
decently
on
a
small
income
after
all
it
better
i
should
have
let
you
know
this
at
once
i
only
realised
a
few
minutes
ago
that
to
be
silent
about
my
projects
was
in
a
way
to
be
guilty
of
false
pretences
the
adroitness
of
this
last
remark
which
directed
itself
with
such
show
of
candour
against
a
suspicion
precisely
the
opposite
of
that
likely
to
be
entertained
by
the
listener
succeeded
in
disarming
warricombe
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
of
reassurance
and
spoke
encouragingly
the
practical
details
i
do
think
you
need
have
any
anxiety
it
is
every
day
that
the
church
of
england
gets
such
a
recruit
let
me
suggest
that
you
have
a
talk
with
my
father
peak
reflected
on
the
proposal
and
replied
to
it
with
grave
thoughtfulness
very
kind
of
you
but
i
should
have
a
difficulty
in
asking
warricombe
advice
i
afraid
i
must
go
on
in
my
own
way
for
a
time
it
will
be
a
few
months
i
daresay
before
i
can
release
myself
from
my
engagements
in
london
i
am
to
understand
that
your
mind
is
really
made
up
quite
no
doubt
we
shall
have
opportunities
of
talking
we
must
meet
in
town
if
possible
you
have
excited
my
curiosity
and
i
ca
help
hoping
you
let
me
see
a
little
further
into
your
mind
some
day
when
i
first
got
hold
of
newman
i
began
to
read
it
with
the
utmost
eagerness
flattering
myself
that
now
at
length
i
should
understand
how
a
man
of
brains
could
travel
such
a
road
i
was
horribly
disappointed
and
not
a
little
enraged
when
i
found
that
he
began
by
assuming
the
very
beliefs
i
thought
he
was
going
to
justify
in
you
i
shall
hope
for
more
logic
is
incapable
of
understanding
such
an
objection
said
peak
with
a
look
of
amusement
you
are
not
the
dialogue
grew
chatty
when
they
exchanged
peak
fancied
that
the
pressure
of
buckland
hand
was
less
fervent
than
at
their
meeting
but
his
manner
no
longer
seemed
to
indicate
distrust
probably
the
agnostic
mood
was
one
of
disdain
godwin
turned
the
key
in
his
bedroom
door
and
strayed
aimlessly
about
he
was
fatigued
but
the
white
fragrant
bed
did
not
yet
invite
him
a
turbulence
in
his
brain
gave
warning
that
it
would
be
long
before
he
slept
he
wound
up
his
watch
the
hands
pointed
to
twelve
chancing
to
come
before
the
mirror
he
saw
that
he
was
unusually
pale
and
that
his
eyes
had
a
swollen
look
the
profound
stillness
was
oppressive
to
him
he
started
nervously
at
an
undefined
object
in
a
dim
corner
and
went
nearer
to
examine
it
he
was
irritable
vaguely
discontented
and
had
even
a
moment
of
nausea
perhaps
the
result
of
tobacco
stronger
than
he
was
accustomed
to
smoke
after
leaning
for
five
minutes
at
the
open
window
he
felt
a
soothing
effect
from
the
air
and
could
think
consecutively
of
the
day
events
what
had
happened
seemed
to
him
incredible
it
was
as
though
he
revived
a
mad
dream
of
ludicrous
coherence
since
his
display
of
rhetoric
at
luncheon
all
was
downright
somnambulism
what
fatal
power
had
subdued
him
what
extraordinary
influence
had
guided
his
tongue
constrained
his
features
his
conscious
self
had
had
no
part
in
all
this
comedy
now
for
the
first
time
was
he
taking
count
of
the
character
he
had
played
had
he
been
told
this
morning
that
why
what
monstrous
folly
was
all
this
into
what
unspeakable
baseness
had
he
fallen
happily
he
had
but
to
take
leave
of
the
warricombe
household
and
rush
into
some
region
where
he
was
unknown
years
hence
he
would
relate
the
story
to
earwaker
for
a
long
time
he
suffered
the
torments
of
this
awakening
shame
buffeted
him
on
the
right
cheek
and
the
left
he
looked
about
like
one
who
slinks
from
merited
chastisement
oh
thrice
ignoble
varlet
to
pose
with
unctuous
hypocrisy
before
people
who
had
welcomed
him
under
their
roof
unquestioned
with
all
the
grace
and
kindliness
of
english
hospitality
to
lie
shamelessly
in
the
face
of
his
old
who
had
been
so
genuinely
glad
to
meet
him
again
yet
such
possibility
had
not
been
unforeseen
at
the
times
of
his
profound
gloom
when
solitude
and
desire
crushed
his
spirit
he
had
wished
that
fate
would
afford
him
such
an
opportunity
of
knavish
success
his
imagination
had
played
with
the
idea
that
a
man
like
himself
might
well
be
driven
to
this
expedient
and
might
even
use
it
with
result
of
a
certainty
the
church
numbered
such
men
among
her
priests
not
mere
lukewarm
sceptics
who
made
religion
a
source
of
income
nor
yet
those
who
had
honestly
entered
the
portal
and
by
necessity
were
held
from
withdrawing
though
their
convictions
had
changed
but
deliberate
schemers
from
the
first
ambitious
but
hungry
natures
unscrupulous
and
they
were
at
no
loss
to
defend
themselves
against
the
attack
of
conscience
life
is
a
terrific
struggle
for
all
who
begin
it
with
no
endowments
save
their
brains
a
hypocrite
was
not
necessarily
a
easy
to
picture
the
unbelieving
priest
whose
influence
was
vastly
for
good
in
word
and
deed
but
he
he
who
had
ever
prided
himself
on
his
intellect
and
had
freely
uttered
his
scorn
of
the
credulous
mob
he
who
was
his
own
criterion
of
moral
right
and
wrong
no
wonder
he
felt
like
a
whipped
cur
it
was
the
ancestral
vice
in
his
blood
brought
out
by
circumstance
the
long
line
of
predecessors
the
grovelling
hinds
and
mechanics
of
his
genealogy
were
responsible
for
this
oh
for
a
name
wherewith
honour
was
hereditary
his
eyes
were
blinded
by
a
rush
of
hot
tears
down
down
into
the
depths
of
uttermost
despondency
of
and
had
it
been
practicable
he
would
have
fled
from
the
house
leaving
its
occupants
to
think
of
him
as
they
would
even
as
ten
years
ago
he
had
fled
from
the
shame
impending
over
him
at
kingsmill
a
cowardly
instinct
this
having
once
acted
upon
it
gave
to
his
whole
life
a
taint
of
craven
meanness
mere
bluster
all
his
talk
of
mental
dignity
and
uncompromising
scorn
of
superstitions
a
weak
and
idle
man
whose
best
years
were
already
wasted
he
gazed
deliberately
at
himself
in
the
glass
at
his
red
eyelids
and
unsightly
lips
darkness
was
best
perhaps
he
might
forget
his
shame
for
an
hour
or
two
ere
the
dawn
renewed
it
he
threw
off
his
garments
heedlessly
extinguished
the
lamp
and
crept
into
the
ready
part
iii
chapter
i
are
you
obstinately
silent
wrote
earwaker
in
a
letter
addressed
to
godwin
at
his
peckham
lodgings
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
must
by
this
time
be
back
from
your
holiday
why
have
you
replied
to
my
letter
of
a
fortnight
ago
nothing
yet
from
if
you
are
really
at
work
as
usual
come
and
see
me
evening
any
time
after
eight
the
posture
of
my
affairs
grows
dubious
the
shadow
of
kenyon
thickens
about
me
in
all
seriousness
i
think
i
shall
be
driven
from
weekly
before
long
my
quarrels
with
runcorn
are
too
frequent
and
his
blackguardism
keeps
more
than
pace
with
the
times
come
or
write
for
i
want
to
know
how
things
go
with
you
peak
read
this
at
breakfast
on
a
saturday
morning
it
was
early
in
september
and
three
weeks
had
elapsed
since
his
return
from
the
west
of
england
upon
the
autumn
had
fallen
a
blight
of
cold
and
rainy
weather
which
did
not
enhance
the
cheerfulness
of
daily
journeying
between
peckham
rye
and
rotherhithe
when
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
set
forth
to
the
train
he
muttered
imprecations
for
a
mood
of
inactivity
possessed
him
he
would
gladly
have
stayed
in
his
comfortable
idling
over
books
or
only
occupied
with
languid
thought
in
the
afternoon
he
was
at
liberty
to
follow
his
impulse
and
this
directed
him
to
the
british
museum
whither
of
late
he
had
several
times
resorted
as
a
reader
among
the
books
for
which
he
applied
was
one
in
german
reusch
und
after
a
little
dallying
he
became
absorbed
in
this
work
and
two
or
three
hours
passed
before
its
hold
on
his
attention
slackened
he
seldom
changed
his
position
the
volume
was
propped
against
others
and
he
sat
bending
forward
his
arms
folded
upon
the
desk
when
he
was
thus
deeply
engaged
his
face
had
a
hard
stern
aspect
if
by
chance
his
eye
wandered
for
a
moment
its
look
seemed
to
express
resentment
of
interruption
at
length
he
threw
himself
back
with
a
sudden
yielding
to
weariness
crossed
his
legs
sank
together
in
the
chair
and
for
brooded
darkly
a
fit
of
yawning
admonished
him
that
it
was
time
to
quit
the
atmosphere
of
study
he
betook
himself
to
a
restaurant
in
the
strand
and
thence
about
eight
made
his
way
to
staple
inn
where
the
journalist
gave
him
cheerful
welcome
after
day
i
have
meant
to
write
thus
he
excused
himself
i
had
really
nothing
to
say
do
look
any
better
for
your
holiday
earwaker
remarked
oh
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
when
do
go
situation
is
comical
i
feel
sure
that
if
i
leave
town
my
connection
with
the
will
come
to
an
end
i
shall
have
a
note
from
runcorn
saying
that
we
had
better
take
this
opportunity
of
terminating
my
engagement
on
the
whole
i
should
be
glad
yet
i
make
up
my
mind
to
be
ousted
by
kenyon
that
what
it
means
they
want
to
get
me
away
but
i
stick
on
postponing
holiday
from
week
to
week
runcorn
ca
decide
to
send
me
about
my
business
yet
every
leader
i
write
enrages
him
but
for
kenyon
i
should
gain
my
point
i
feel
sure
of
it
it
one
of
those
cases
in
which
homicide
would
be
justified
by
public
interest
if
kenyon
gets
my
place
the
paper
becomes
at
once
an
organ
of
ruffiandom
the
delight
of
the
blackguardry
the
circulation
inquired
peak
sound
that
adds
to
the
joke
this
series
of
stories
by
doubleday
has
helped
us
a
good
deal
and
my
contention
is
if
we
can
keep
financially
right
by
help
of
this
kind
why
not
make
a
little
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
raising
our
political
tone
runcorn
wo
see
it
he
listens
eagerly
to
kenyon
assurance
that
we
might
sell
several
thousand
more
by
striking
the
true
note
pitch
the
thing
over
wash
your
hands
and
go
to
cleaner
work
work
i
am
doing
is
clean
enough
replied
earwaker
me
have
my
way
and
i
can
make
the
paper
a
decent
one
and
a
useful
one
i
sha
easily
find
another
such
chance
idealism
has
a
strong
root
said
godwin
rather
contemptuously
half
envy
you
there
must
be
a
distinct
pleasure
in
believing
that
any
intellectual
influence
will
exalt
the
english
democracy
not
sure
that
i
do
believe
it
but
i
enjoy
the
experiment
the
chief
pleasure
i
suppose
is
in
fighting
runcorn
and
kenyon
are
too
strong
for
you
earwaker
they
have
the
spirit
of
the
age
to
back
them
up
the
journalist
became
silent
he
smiled
but
the
harassment
of
conflict
marked
his
features
hear
nothing
about
the
new
sophistry
he
remarked
when
godwin
had
begun
to
examine
some
books
that
lay
on
the
table
has
the
trick
of
keeping
manuscripts
a
long
time
everything
that
seems
at
the
first
glance
tolerable
he
sends
to
the
printer
then
muses
over
it
at
his
leisure
probably
your
paper
is
in
type
do
care
a
rap
whether
it
is
or
not
what
do
you
think
of
this
book
of
oldwinkle
he
was
holding
a
volume
of
humorous
stories
which
had
greatly
taken
the
fancy
of
the
public
uncommonly
good
replied
the
journalist
laughing
had
a
prejudice
against
the
fellow
but
he
has
overcome
me
it
more
than
good
farce
something
like
really
strong
humour
here
and
there
quite
believe
it
said
peak
i
could
read
a
page
whatever
the
mob
enjoys
is
at
once
spoilt
for
me
however
good
i
should
otherwise
think
it
i
am
sick
of
seeing
and
hearing
the
man
name
earwaker
shook
his
head
in
deprecation
my
boy
one
must
be
able
to
judge
and
enjoy
impartially
know
it
but
i
shall
never
improve
this
book
seems
to
me
to
have
a
bad
smell
it
looks
mauled
with
dirty
fingers
i
despise
oldwinkle
for
his
popularity
to
make
them
laugh
and
to
laugh
them
pah
they
debated
this
point
for
some
time
peak
growing
more
violent
though
his
friend
preserved
a
smiling
equanimity
a
tirade
of
virulent
contempt
in
which
godwin
exhibited
all
his
powers
of
savage
eloquence
was
broken
by
a
visitor
summons
at
the
door
malkin
said
the
journalist
see
each
other
at
last
peak
could
not
at
once
command
himself
to
the
look
and
tone
desirable
in
meeting
a
stranger
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
he
gazed
with
a
scowl
of
curiosity
at
the
man
who
presented
himself
and
when
he
shook
hands
it
was
in
silence
but
malkin
made
speech
from
the
others
unnecessary
for
several
minutes
with
animated
voice
and
gesture
he
poured
forth
apologies
for
his
failure
to
keep
the
appointment
of
six
or
seven
weeks
ago
the
gravest
call
of
duty
could
have
kept
me
away
i
do
assure
you
no
doubt
earwaker
has
informed
you
of
the
circumstances
i
telegraphed
i
think
i
telegraphed
did
i
earwaker
have
some
recollection
of
a
word
or
two
of
scant
excuse
replied
the
journalist
i
implore
you
to
consider
the
haste
i
was
in
cried
malkin
five
minutes
mr
peak
to
book
to
register
luggage
to
do
everything
not
five
minutes
i
protest
but
here
we
are
at
last
let
us
talk
let
us
talk
he
seated
himself
with
an
air
of
supreme
enjoyment
and
began
to
cram
the
bowl
of
a
large
pipe
from
a
bulky
pouch
stands
the
fight
with
kenyon
and
he
cried
as
soon
as
the
tobacco
was
glowing
earwaker
briefly
repeated
what
he
had
told
peak
out
no
surrender
and
no
compromise
what
your
opinion
mr
peak
on
the
abstract
question
is
a
popular
paper
likely
or
not
to
be
damaged
in
its
circulation
by
improvement
of
style
and
tone
within
the
limits
of
discretion
should
be
surprised
if
it
were
peak
answered
drily
afraid
you
right
there
no
use
in
blinking
truths
however
disagreeable
but
for
earwaker
that
is
the
main
issue
what
he
has
to
do
is
to
assert
himself
every
man
first
duty
is
to
assert
himself
at
all
events
this
is
how
i
regard
the
matter
i
am
all
for
individualism
for
the
development
of
one
personality
at
whatever
cost
no
compromise
on
points
of
faith
earwaker
has
his
ideal
of
journalistic
duty
and
in
a
fight
with
fellows
like
runcorn
and
kenyon
he
must
stand
firm
as
a
rock
ca
see
that
he
called
upon
to
fight
at
all
said
peak
in
a
false
position
let
him
get
out
of
it
false
position
i
ca
see
that
no
man
better
fitted
than
earwaker
to
raise
the
tone
of
radical
journalism
here
a
big
sunday
newspaper
practically
in
his
hands
it
seems
to
me
that
the
circumstances
give
him
a
grand
opportunity
of
making
his
force
felt
what
are
we
all
seeking
but
an
opportunity
for
striking
out
with
effect
godwin
listened
with
a
sceptical
smile
and
made
answer
in
slow
careless
tones
happens
to
be
employed
and
paid
by
certain
capitalists
to
increase
the
sale
of
their
paper
dear
sir
cried
the
other
bouncing
upon
his
seat
can
you
take
such
a
view
a
great
newspaper
surely
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
mere
source
of
income
these
capitalists
declare
that
they
have
at
heart
the
interests
of
the
working
classes
so
has
earwaker
and
he
is
far
better
able
than
they
to
promote
those
interests
his
duty
is
to
apply
their
money
to
the
best
use
morally
speaking
if
he
were
lukewarm
in
the
matter
i
should
be
the
first
to
advise
his
retirement
but
this
fight
is
entirely
congenial
to
him
i
trust
he
will
hold
his
own
to
the
last
possible
moment
must
remember
put
in
the
journalist
with
a
look
of
amusement
peak
has
no
sympathy
with
radicalism
lament
it
but
that
does
not
affect
my
argument
if
you
were
a
high
tory
i
should
urge
you
just
as
strongly
to
assert
yourself
surely
you
agree
with
this
point
of
mine
mr
peak
you
admit
that
a
man
must
develop
whatever
strength
is
in
him
not
at
all
sure
of
that
malkin
fixed
himself
sideways
in
the
chair
and
examined
his
collocutor
face
earnestly
he
endeavoured
to
subdue
his
excitement
to
the
tone
of
courteous
debate
but
the
words
that
at
length
escaped
him
were
humorously
blunt
of
what
you
sure
nothing
we
touch
bottom
cried
malkin
speaking
i
agree
with
you
but
we
have
to
live
our
lives
and
i
suppose
we
must
direct
ourselves
by
some
conscious
principle
do
see
the
necessity
peak
replied
still
in
an
impassive
tone
may
very
well
be
guided
by
circumstances
as
they
arise
to
be
sure
there
a
principle
in
that
but
i
take
it
you
mean
something
different
i
do
i
hold
that
the
will
must
direct
circumstances
not
receive
its
impulse
from
them
how
then
are
we
to
be
guided
what
do
you
set
before
yourself
get
through
life
with
as
much
satisfaction
and
as
little
pain
as
possible
are
a
hedonist
then
well
and
good
then
that
is
your
conscious
principle
it
is
am
i
to
understand
you
recognising
that
a
man
intellectual
and
moral
principles
as
likely
as
not
tend
to
anything
but
his
happiness
ca
admit
it
exclaimed
malkin
leaping
from
his
chair
happiness
do
know
is
happiness
what
happiness
really
do
know
answered
the
journalist
mirthfully
is
trifling
with
a
grave
question
we
all
know
perfectly
well
that
happiness
is
the
conscious
exertion
of
individual
powers
why
is
there
so
much
suffering
under
our
present
social
system
because
the
majority
of
men
are
crushed
to
a
dead
level
of
mechanical
toil
with
no
opportunity
of
developing
their
special
faculties
give
a
man
scope
and
happiness
is
put
within
his
reach
do
you
mean
by
scope
inquired
godwin
scope
why
room
to
expand
the
vice
of
our
society
is
hypocrisy
it
comes
of
when
a
man
is
allowed
to
be
himself
he
takes
refuge
in
a
mean
imitation
of
those
other
men
who
appear
to
be
better
off
that
was
what
sent
me
off
to
south
america
i
got
into
politics
and
found
that
i
was
in
danger
of
growing
dishonest
of
compromising
and
toadying
in
the
wilderness
i
found
myself
do
you
seriously
believe
that
happiness
can
be
obtained
by
ignoring
one
convictions
he
addressed
the
question
to
both
snuffing
the
air
with
head
thrown
back
if
you
have
no
convictions
asked
peak
you
are
incapable
of
happiness
in
any
worthy
sense
you
may
graze
but
you
will
never
feast
the
listeners
joined
in
laughter
and
malkin
after
a
hesitation
allowed
his
face
to
relax
in
sympathy
look
here
he
cried
earwaker
suppose
you
sent
conscience
to
the
devil
and
set
yourself
to
please
runcorn
by
increasing
the
circulation
of
your
paper
by
whatever
means
you
would
flourish
undoubtedly
in
a
short
time
you
would
be
chief
editor
and
your
pockets
would
burst
with
money
but
what
about
your
peace
of
mind
what
about
happiness
i
disposed
to
agree
with
peak
answered
the
journalist
i
take
that
line
i
should
be
a
happier
man
than
conscientiousness
will
ever
make
me
malkin
swelled
with
indignation
do
mean
it
you
are
turning
a
grave
argument
into
jest
where
my
hat
where
the
devil
is
my
hat
send
for
me
again
when
you
are
disposed
to
talk
seriously
he
strode
towards
the
door
but
earwaker
arrested
him
with
a
shout
leaving
your
pipe
i
am
where
is
it
did
i
tell
you
where
i
bought
this
pipe
what
the
wood
on
the
instant
malkin
fell
into
a
cheerful
vein
of
reminiscence
in
five
minutes
he
was
giving
a
rapturous
description
of
tropical
scenes
laughing
joyously
as
he
addressed
now
one
now
the
other
of
his
companions
hear
you
have
a
mind
to
see
those
countries
mr
peak
he
said
at
length
you
care
for
a
travelling
companion
rather
but
you
pardon
that
pray
give
me
the
preference
i
should
enjoy
above
all
things
to
travel
with
a
man
of
science
very
doubtful
whether
i
shall
ever
get
so
far
godwin
replied
musingly
and
as
he
spoke
he
rose
to
take
leave
earwaker
protest
that
it
was
not
yet
ten
did
not
influence
him
want
to
reflect
on
the
meaning
of
happiness
he
said
extending
his
hand
to
malkin
and
in
spite
of
the
smile
his
face
had
a
sombre
cast
the
two
who
were
left
of
course
discussed
him
wo
care
much
for
peak
said
earwaker
and
i
suit
each
other
because
there
a
good
deal
of
indifferentism
in
both
of
us
moral
earnestness
always
goes
against
the
grain
with
him
i
noticed
it
frequently
sorry
i
spoke
so
dogmatically
it
was
altogether
good
manners
suppose
i
write
him
a
short
letter
just
expressing
my
regret
for
having
been
led
away
needless
laughed
the
journalist
thinks
all
the
better
of
you
for
your
zeal
but
happiness
is
a
sore
point
with
him
few
men
i
should
think
have
known
less
of
it
i
ca
imagine
any
circumstances
which
would
make
him
thoroughly
at
peace
with
himself
and
the
world
fellow
you
can
see
something
of
that
in
his
face
why
does
he
get
married
remarkable
suggestion
by
the
way
why
do
dear
boy
there
nothing
i
wish
more
but
it
a
business
of
such
fearful
precariousness
i
one
of
those
men
whom
marriage
will
either
make
or
ruin
you
know
my
characteristics
the
slightest
check
upon
my
independence
and
all
up
with
me
the
woman
i
marry
must
be
perfectly
reasonable
perfectly
she
must
have
excellent
education
and
every
delicacy
of
breeding
where
am
i
to
find
this
paragon
is
open
to
you
but
i
am
not
open
to
society
i
do
take
kindly
to
the
people
of
my
own
class
no
i
tell
you
what
my
only
chance
of
getting
a
suitable
wife
is
to
train
some
very
young
girl
for
the
purpose
misunderstand
me
for
heaven
sake
i
mean
that
i
must
make
a
friendship
with
some
schoolgirl
in
whose
education
i
can
have
a
voice
whose
relatives
will
permit
me
to
influence
her
mind
and
develop
her
character
what
do
you
think
of
this
idea
bad
but
it
demands
patience
who
more
patient
than
i
but
let
us
talk
of
that
poor
jacox
and
her
girls
you
feel
that
you
know
them
pretty
well
from
my
letters
do
you
nothing
more
monstrous
can
be
imagined
than
the
treatment
to
which
this
poor
woman
has
been
subjected
i
could
have
believed
that
such
dishonesty
and
brutality
were
possible
in
english
families
of
decent
position
her
husband
deserted
her
her
brother
robbed
her
her
libelled
her
the
whole
story
is
nauseating
quite
sure
that
she
tells
you
the
truth
malkin
glared
with
sudden
resentment
truth
what
you
also
desire
to
calumniate
her
for
shame
earwaker
a
poor
widow
toiling
to
support
herself
in
a
foreign
country
with
two
children
dependent
on
her
yes
yes
but
you
seem
to
know
very
little
of
her
know
her
perfectly
and
all
her
circumstances
jacox
was
the
mother
of
the
two
girls
whom
malkin
had
escorted
to
rouen
after
an
hour
or
so
of
all
but
casual
acquaintance
she
and
her
history
had
come
in
a
very
slight
degree
under
the
notice
of
certain
people
with
whom
malkin
was
on
friendly
terms
and
hearing
that
the
children
bella
and
lily
aged
fourteen
and
twelve
respectively
were
about
to
undertake
alone
a
journey
to
the
continent
the
erratic
hero
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
see
them
safe
at
their
mother
side
instead
of
returning
forthwith
he
lingered
in
normandy
for
several
weeks
striking
off
at
length
on
the
summons
of
a
friend
to
orleans
whence
he
was
only
returned
two
or
three
letters
had
kept
earwaker
informed
of
his
movements
of
jacox
he
wrote
as
he
now
spoke
with
compassionate
respect
and
the
girls
according
to
him
were
exquisite
models
of
budding
maidenhood
have
told
me
said
earwaker
calmly
fronting
the
indignant
outburst
her
circumstances
are
at
present
assists
an
english
lady
in
the
management
of
a
boardinghouse
malkin
replied
with
an
air
which
forbade
trivial
comment
and
lily
will
of
course
continue
their
studies
i
daresay
i
shall
run
over
now
and
then
to
see
them
i
without
offence
inquire
if
either
of
these
young
ladies
seems
suitable
for
the
ideal
training
of
which
you
spoke
malkin
smiled
thoughtfully
he
stood
with
his
legs
apart
and
stroked
his
blond
beard
surmise
is
not
unnatural
well
i
confess
that
bella
has
inspired
me
with
no
little
interest
she
is
rather
mature
unfortunately
i
wish
she
had
been
lily
age
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
musing
he
refilled
his
pipe
and
gossip
was
prolonged
till
something
after
one
malkin
was
never
known
to
retire
willingly
from
an
evening
congenial
talk
until
the
small
hours
were
in
progress
peak
on
reaching
home
about
eleven
was
surprised
to
see
a
light
in
his
window
as
he
entered
his
landlady
informed
him
that
moxey
had
been
waiting
upstairs
for
an
hour
or
two
christian
was
reading
he
laid
down
the
book
and
rose
languidly
his
face
was
flushed
and
he
spoke
with
a
laugh
which
suggested
that
a
fit
of
despondency
as
occasionally
happened
had
tempted
him
to
excess
in
cordials
godwin
understood
these
signs
he
knew
that
his
intellect
was
rather
brightened
than
impaired
by
such
stimulus
and
he
affected
not
to
be
conscious
of
any
peculiarity
you
would
come
to
me
christian
began
had
no
choice
but
to
come
to
you
my
visit
is
unwelcome
i
hope
not
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
home
you
know
the
time
trouble
i
sha
go
to
bed
let
me
sit
here
and
read
will
you
if
i
feel
tired
i
can
lie
down
on
the
sofa
what
a
delightful
book
this
is
i
must
get
it
it
was
a
history
of
the
italian
renaissance
recently
published
does
this
phrase
come
from
he
continued
pointing
to
a
scrap
of
paper
used
as
a
on
which
godwin
had
pencilled
a
note
the
words
were
ut
moris
intus
ut
mentioned
there
peak
replied
the
motto
of
those
humanists
who
outwardly
conformed
to
the
common
faith
see
all
very
well
when
the
inquisition
was
flourishing
but
sounds
ignoble
nowadays
you
think
so
in
a
age
whether
the
sixteenth
or
the
nineteenth
century
a
wise
man
may
do
worse
than
adopt
it
be
honest
surely
peak
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
then
exclaimed
irritably
honest
who
is
or
can
be
honest
who
truly
declares
himself
when
a
man
has
learnt
that
truth
is
indeterminable
how
is
it
more
moral
to
go
about
crying
that
you
do
believe
a
certain
dogma
than
to
concede
that
the
dogma
may
possibly
be
true
this
new
morality
of
the
agnostics
is
mere
paltry
conceit
why
must
i
make
solemn
declaration
that
i
do
believe
in
absolute
knowledge
i
might
as
well
be
called
upon
to
inform
all
my
acquaintances
how
i
stand
with
regard
to
the
theories
of
chemical
affinity
one
philosophy
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
of
life
if
i
chose
to
become
a
church
of
england
clergyman
what
moral
objection
could
be
made
this
illustration
was
so
amusing
to
moxey
that
his
surprise
at
what
preceded
gave
way
to
laughter
wonder
he
exclaimed
you
never
seriously
thought
of
a
profession
for
which
you
are
so
evidently
cut
out
godwin
kept
silence
his
face
had
darkened
and
he
seated
himself
with
sullen
weariness
me
what
you
been
doing
resumed
moxey
have
i
heard
from
you
should
have
come
in
a
day
or
two
i
thought
you
were
probably
out
of
town
husband
is
ill
said
the
other
by
way
of
reply
he
leaned
forward
with
his
arms
upon
the
table
and
gazed
at
godwin
with
eyes
of
peculiar
brightness
is
he
returned
godwin
with
slow
interest
the
same
way
as
before
but
much
worse
christian
paused
and
when
he
again
spoke
it
was
hurriedly
confusedly
can
i
help
getting
excited
about
it
how
can
i
behave
decently
you
the
only
man
i
ever
speak
to
on
the
subject
and
no
doubt
i
both
weary
and
disgust
you
but
i
speak
to
some
one
my
nerves
are
strung
beyond
endurance
it
only
by
speaking
that
i
can
ease
myself
from
the
intolerable
strain
you
seen
her
lately
for
a
moment
in
the
street
it
ten
months
since
the
last
meeting
remarked
godwin
abruptly
probable
the
man
will
die
one
of
these
days
then
your
trials
will
have
a
happy
end
i
see
no
harm
in
hoping
that
his
life
may
be
short
that
a
conventional
feeling
if
two
people
can
be
benefited
by
the
death
of
a
single
person
why
should
we
be
glad
in
the
prospect
of
his
dying
not
of
his
suffering
that
quite
another
thing
but
die
he
must
and
to
curtail
the
life
of
a
being
who
at
length
wholly
ceases
to
exist
is
no
injury
you
ca
injure
a
nonentity
do
you
think
i
should
take
it
ill
if
i
knew
that
some
persons
were
wishing
my
death
why
look
if
ever
i
crush
a
little
green
fly
that
crawls
upon
me
in
the
fields
at
once
i
am
filled
with
envy
of
its
fate
sincerest
envy
to
have
passed
so
suddenly
from
being
into
nothingness
how
blessed
an
extinction
to
feel
in
that
way
instinctively
in
the
very
depths
of
your
soul
is
to
be
a
true
pessimist
if
i
had
ever
doubted
my
sincerity
in
pessimism
this
experience
several
times
repeated
would
have
reassured
me
christian
covered
his
face
and
brooded
for
a
long
time
whilst
godwin
sat
with
his
eyes
on
vacancy
and
see
us
said
the
former
at
length
do
you
keep
away
in
no
mood
for
society
have
no
one
only
marcella
and
i
again
a
long
silence
is
going
in
for
comparative
philology
christian
resumed
with
the
gentle
tone
in
which
he
invariably
spoke
of
his
sister
a
mind
that
girl
has
i
never
knew
any
woman
of
half
her
powers
godwin
said
nothing
continued
the
other
fervently
of
half
her
goodness
i
sometimes
think
that
no
mortal
could
come
nearer
to
our
ideal
of
moral
justice
and
purity
if
it
were
not
for
her
i
should
long
ago
have
gone
to
perdition
in
one
way
or
another
it
her
strength
not
my
own
that
has
saved
me
i
daresay
you
know
this
some
truth
in
it
i
believe
peak
answered
his
eye
wandering
how
circumstances
can
affect
one
judgment
if
just
about
the
time
i
first
knew
you
i
had
abandoned
myself
to
a
life
of
sottish
despair
of
course
i
should
have
charged
constance
with
the
blame
of
it
now
that
i
have
struggled
on
i
can
see
that
she
has
been
a
blessing
to
me
instead
of
a
curse
if
marcella
has
given
me
strength
i
have
to
thank
constance
for
the
spiritual
joy
which
otherwise
i
should
never
have
known
peak
uttered
a
short
laugh
is
only
saying
that
she
have
been
ruinous
but
in
the
course
of
circumstances
has
proved
helpful
i
envy
your
power
of
deriving
comfort
from
such
reflections
we
view
things
differently
i
have
the
habit
of
looking
to
the
consolatory
facts
of
life
you
to
the
depressing
there
an
unfortunate
lack
in
you
peak
you
seem
insensible
to
female
influence
and
i
believe
that
is
closely
connected
with
your
desperate
pessimism
godwin
laughed
again
this
time
with
mocking
length
of
note
now
is
it
true
urged
the
other
do
you
care
for
women
at
all
not
grave
misfortune
depend
upon
it
it
accounts
for
nearly
everything
that
is
unsatisfactory
in
your
life
if
you
had
ever
been
sincerely
devoted
to
a
woman
be
assured
your
powers
would
have
developed
in
a
way
of
which
you
have
no
conception
it
no
answer
to
tell
me
that
am
still
a
mere
trifler
never
likely
to
do
anything
of
account
i
have
it
in
me
to
be
anything
better
and
i
might
easily
have
become
much
worse
but
you
might
have
made
yourself
a
great
position
i
mean
you
do
so
you
are
still
very
young
if
only
you
knew
the
desire
of
a
woman
help
really
think
so
said
godwin
with
grave
irony
am
sure
of
it
there
no
harm
in
repeating
what
you
have
often
told
me
your
egoism
oppresses
you
a
woman
influence
takes
one
out
of
oneself
no
man
can
be
a
better
authority
on
this
than
i
for
more
than
eleven
years
i
have
worshipped
one
woman
with
absolute
faithfulness
interrupted
godwin
bluntly
exception
occurs
to
you
you
challenge
inquiry
forgive
me
for
asking
what
your
interest
was
in
one
of
your
cousins
at
twybridge
christian
started
and
averted
his
face
with
a
look
of
embarrassment
you
mean
to
say
that
you
knew
anything
about
that
was
always
an
observer
peak
replied
smiling
do
remember
perhaps
that
i
happened
to
be
present
when
a
letter
had
just
arrived
for
you
at
your
uncle
house
a
letter
which
evidently
disturbed
you
is
astonishing
peak
you
a
terrible
fellow
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
ever
be
at
your
mercy
yes
you
are
quite
right
he
continued
despondently
that
was
no
real
unfaithfulness
i
quite
know
how
to
explain
it
i
make
love
to
poor
janet
and
with
the
result
that
i
have
never
since
seen
any
of
the
family
my
uncle
when
he
found
i
had
drawn
back
was
very
savage
naturally
enough
marcella
and
i
never
again
went
to
twybridge
i
liked
janet
she
was
a
good
kind
girl
i
believed
just
then
that
my
love
for
constance
was
hopeless
my
mood
impelled
me
to
the
conviction
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
was
to
marry
janet
and
settle
down
to
a
peaceful
domestic
life
then
came
that
letter
it
was
from
constance
herself
it
meant
nothing
yet
it
was
enough
to
revive
all
my
hopes
i
rushed
off
how
brutally
i
had
behaved
poor
little
janet
he
let
his
face
fall
upon
his
hands
me
an
indiscreet
question
said
peak
after
a
silence
you
any
founded
hope
of
marrying
constance
if
she
becomes
a
widow
christian
started
and
looked
up
with
wide
eyes
every
hope
i
have
the
absolute
assurance
of
her
love
see
i
must
mislead
you
pursued
the
other
hurriedly
relations
are
absolutely
pure
i
have
only
allowed
myself
to
see
her
at
very
long
intervals
why
should
i
tell
you
it
was
less
than
a
year
after
her
marriage
i
found
her
alone
in
a
room
in
a
friend
house
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
i
could
help
holding
my
hand
to
her
she
took
it
and
held
it
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
me
steadily
and
whispered
my
name
that
was
all
i
knew
then
that
she
repented
of
her
marriage
who
can
say
what
led
her
into
it
i
was
poor
you
know
perhaps
but
in
spite
of
all
she
love
me
there
has
never
since
been
anything
like
a
scene
of
emotion
between
us
her
conscience
could
allow
she
is
a
woman
and
has
done
her
duty
but
if
she
is
free
he
quivered
with
passionate
feeling
you
are
content
said
godwin
drily
have
wasted
ten
years
of
your
life
for
such
a
possibility
christian
exclaimed
come
peak
why
you
affect
this
wretched
cynicism
is
it
waste
of
years
to
have
lived
with
the
highest
and
purest
ideal
perpetually
before
one
mind
what
can
a
man
do
better
than
having
found
an
admirable
woman
to
worship
her
thenceforth
and
defy
every
temptation
that
could
lead
him
astray
i
do
like
to
seem
boastful
but
i
lived
purely
and
devotedly
and
if
the
test
endured
to
the
end
of
my
life
i
could
sustain
it
is
the
consciousness
of
my
love
nothing
to
constance
has
it
not
helped
her
such
profound
sincerity
was
astonishing
to
peak
he
did
not
admire
it
for
it
seemed
to
him
in
this
case
at
all
events
the
fatal
weakness
of
a
character
it
was
impossible
not
to
love
though
he
could
not
declare
his
doubts
he
thought
it
more
than
probable
that
this
laura
of
the
voiceless
petrarch
was
unworthy
of
such
constancy
and
that
she
had
no
intention
whatever
of
rewarding
it
even
if
the
opportunity
arrived
but
this
was
the
mere
speculation
of
a
pessimist
he
might
be
altogether
wrong
for
he
had
never
denied
the
existence
of
high
virtue
in
man
or
woman
goes
midnight
he
remarked
turning
from
the
subject
ca
sleep
neither
can
i
why
should
we
walk
into
town
all
means
on
condition
that
you
will
come
home
with
me
and
spend
there
well
they
set
forth
and
with
varied
talk
often
broken
by
long
silences
made
their
way
through
sleeping
suburbs
to
the
dark
valley
of
thames
there
passed
another
month
during
which
peak
was
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
by
his
friends
one
evening
in
october
as
he
sat
studying
at
the
british
museum
a
friendly
voice
claimed
his
attention
he
rose
nervously
and
met
the
searching
eye
of
buckland
warricombe
had
it
in
mind
to
write
to
you
said
the
latter
we
parted
down
yonder
i
have
been
running
about
a
good
deal
with
few
days
in
town
do
you
often
read
here
on
saturday
afternoon
buckland
glanced
at
the
open
volume
and
caught
a
heading
theology
at
the
works
i
shall
be
there
till
christmas
no
longer
you
by
chance
disengaged
could
you
dine
with
me
i
shall
be
alone
perhaps
you
do
mind
that
we
could
exchange
views
on
fate
foreknowledge
absolute
godwin
accepted
the
invitation
and
warricombe
unable
to
linger
took
leave
of
him
they
met
the
next
evening
in
buckland
rooms
not
far
from
the
houses
of
parliament
commonplace
comfort
was
the
note
of
these
quarters
peak
wondered
that
a
man
who
had
it
in
his
power
to
surround
himself
with
evidences
of
taste
should
be
content
to
dwell
thus
his
host
seemed
to
detect
this
thought
in
the
glances
godwin
cast
about
him
but
a
i
have
been
here
three
or
four
years
but
i
do
think
of
it
as
a
home
i
suppose
i
shall
settle
somewhere
before
long
yet
on
the
whole
what
does
it
matter
where
one
lives
there
something
in
the
atmosphere
of
our
time
that
makes
one
indisposed
to
strike
roots
in
the
old
way
who
knows
how
long
be
such
a
thing
as
real
property
we
are
getting
to
think
of
ourselves
as
lodgers
it
as
well
to
be
indifferent
about
a
notice
to
quit
people
would
still
make
a
good
fight
for
the
old
homes
replied
peak
i
daresay
i
should
myself
if
i
were
a
family
man
a
wife
and
children
are
strong
persuasions
to
conservatism
in
those
who
have
anything
that
to
say
let
the
families
who
have
nothing
learn
how
they
stand
in
point
of
numbers
and
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
you
are
doing
your
best
to
teach
them
that
buckland
smiled
few
other
things
at
the
same
time
one
is
necessarily
an
anarchist
you
know
enormous
faith
you
must
have
in
the
metaphysical
powers
of
the
multitude
but
say
rather
in
the
universal
that
the
trait
of
human
nature
which
we
have
in
mind
when
we
speak
of
enlightenment
the
aim
of
practical
radicalism
is
to
instruct
selfishness
astonishing
how
capable
it
is
of
being
instructed
the
mistake
of
the
socialist
lies
in
his
crediting
men
with
far
too
much
far
too
little
perception
of
their
own
limits
the
characteristic
of
mankind
at
large
is
humility
peak
began
to
understand
his
old
acquaintance
he
had
imagined
him
less
acute
gratified
by
the
smile
of
interest
warricombe
added
are
forces
of
madness
i
have
shown
you
that
i
make
allowance
for
them
but
they
are
only
dangerous
so
long
as
privilege
allies
itself
with
hypocrisy
the
task
of
the
modern
civiliser
is
to
sweep
away
sham
idealisms
agree
with
you
godwin
replied
with
sudden
change
of
mood
buckland
began
to
speak
of
an
indifferent
topic
of
the
day
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
sat
down
to
dinner
not
till
the
welcome
tobacco
blended
its
aroma
with
that
of
coffee
did
a
frankly
personal
note
sound
in
their
conversation
at
christmas
you
are
free
said
warricombe
still
think
of
leaving
london
have
decided
to
go
down
into
devonshire
seaside
shall
stay
first
of
all
in
exeter
godwin
replied
with
deliberation
can
get
hold
of
books
there
especially
of
the
ecclesiastical
colour
are
still
unable
to
regard
my
position
with
anything
but
contempt
peak
asked
looking
steadily
at
the
critical
face
now
what
does
it
all
mean
of
course
i
quite
understand
how
tolerant
the
church
is
becoming
i
know
what
latitude
it
permits
in
its
servants
but
what
do
you
propose
to
yourself
what
you
call
the
work
of
the
civiliser
to
attack
sham
ideals
for
instance
authority
of
the
mob
answered
peak
suavely
clericalism
is
political
then
a
great
extent
discern
a
vague
sort
of
consistency
in
this
you
regard
the
church
formulas
as
merely
symbolical
useful
for
the
purposes
of
the
day
for
the
purposes
of
eternity
the
human
sense
every
sense
warricombe
perceived
that
no
directness
of
questioning
would
elicit
literal
response
and
on
the
whole
this
relieved
him
to
hear
godwin
peak
using
the
language
of
a
fervent
curate
would
have
excited
in
him
something
more
than
disgust
it
did
not
seem
impossible
that
a
nature
like
peak
intellectually
arrogant
vehemently
should
have
been
attracted
by
the
traditions
the
social
prestige
of
the
anglican
church
nor
at
all
unlikely
that
a
mind
so
constituted
should
justify
a
seeming
acceptance
of
dogmas
which
in
the
strict
sense
it
despised
but
he
was
made
uneasy
by
his
ignorance
of
peak
private
life
during
the
years
since
their
parting
at
college
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
the
possible
establishment
of
intimacy
between
this
man
of
low
origin
uncertain
career
boundless
ambition
and
the
household
of
martin
warricombe
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
peak
had
decided
to
go
to
exeter
because
of
the
social
prospects
recently
opened
to
him
in
the
vulgar
phrase
he
had
probably
stock
of
idiosyncrasy
and
saw
therein
a
valuable
opportunity
for
a
theological
student
who
at
the
same
time
was
a
devotee
of
natural
science
to
be
sure
the
people
at
exeter
could
be
put
on
their
guard
on
the
other
hand
peak
had
plainly
avowed
his
desire
to
form
social
connections
of
the
useful
kind
in
his
position
such
an
aim
was
essential
a
mere
matter
of
course
godwin
voice
interrupted
this
train
of
thought
me
ask
you
a
plain
question
you
have
twice
been
kind
enough
to
introduce
me
to
your
home
as
a
friend
of
yours
am
i
guilty
of
presumption
in
hoping
that
your
parents
will
continue
to
regard
me
as
an
acquaintance
i
trust
there
no
need
to
assure
you
that
i
know
the
meaning
of
discretion
an
appeal
to
buckland
generosity
seldom
failed
yes
it
was
true
that
he
had
more
than
once
encouraged
the
hope
now
frankly
expressed
indulging
a
correspondent
frankness
he
might
explain
that
position
was
so
distasteful
to
him
that
it
disturbed
the
future
with
many
kinds
of
uncertainty
but
this
would
be
churlish
he
must
treat
his
guest
as
a
gentleman
so
long
as
nothing
compelled
him
to
take
the
less
agreeable
view
dear
peak
let
us
have
none
of
these
formalities
my
parents
have
distinctly
invited
you
to
go
and
see
them
whenever
you
are
in
the
neighbourhood
i
am
quite
sure
they
will
help
to
make
your
stay
in
exeter
a
pleasant
one
therewith
closed
the
hazardous
dialogue
warricombe
turned
at
once
to
a
safe
topic
that
of
contemporary
fiction
and
they
chatted
pleasantly
enough
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
not
many
days
after
this
godwin
received
by
post
an
envelope
which
contained
certain
proof
sheets
and
therewith
a
note
in
which
the
editor
of
critical
signified
his
acceptance
of
a
paper
entitled
new
sophistry
the
communication
was
originally
addressed
to
earwaker
who
had
scribbled
at
the
foot
if
you
are
alive
and
send
back
to
dolby
the
next
morning
he
did
not
set
out
as
usual
for
rotherhithe
through
the
night
he
had
not
closed
his
eyes
he
was
in
a
state
of
nervousness
which
bordered
on
fever
a
dozen
times
he
had
read
over
the
proofs
with
throbbing
pulse
with
exultant
but
the
errors
which
had
caught
his
eye
and
a
few
faults
of
phrase
were
still
uncorrected
what
a
capital
piece
of
writing
it
was
what
a
flagellation
of
and
all
his
tribe
if
this
did
not
rouse
echoes
in
the
literary
world
through
the
long
day
he
sat
in
languor
or
paced
his
room
like
one
made
restless
by
pain
only
when
the
gloom
of
nightfall
obliged
him
to
light
his
lamp
did
he
at
length
sit
down
to
the
table
and
carefully
revise
the
proofs
pen
in
hand
when
he
had
made
up
the
packet
for
post
he
wrote
to
earwaker
had
forgotten
all
about
this
thing
proofs
have
gone
to
dolby
i
have
not
signed
probably
he
would
object
to
my
doing
so
as
it
is
the
paper
can
be
ascribed
to
anyone
and
attention
thus
excited
we
shall
see
paragraphs
attributing
it
to
men
of
mark
perhaps
scandal
will
fix
it
on
a
bishop
in
any
case
do
let
out
the
secret
i
beg
this
seriously
and
for
a
solid
reason
not
a
word
to
anyone
however
intimate
if
dolby
betrays
name
grin
and
bear
it
i
depend
upon
your
friendship
chapter
ii
in
a
which
declines
from
the
main
thoroughfare
of
exeter
and
bears
the
name
of
longbrook
street
is
a
row
of
small
houses
placed
above
long
strips
of
sloping
garden
they
are
old
and
plain
with
no
architectural
feature
calling
for
mention
unless
it
be
the
latticed
porch
which
gives
the
doors
an
awkward
quaintness
just
beyond
the

crosses
a
hollow
and
begins
the
ascent
of
a
hill
here
interposed
between
the
city
and
the

of
exe
the
little
terrace
may
be
regarded
as
urban
or
rural
according
to
the
tastes
and
occasions
of
those
who
dwell
there
in
one
direction
a
walk
of
five
minutes
will
conduct
to
the
middle
of
high
street
and
in
the
other
it
takes
scarcely
longer
to
reach
the
open
country
on
the
upper
floor
of
one
of
these
cottages
godwin
peak
had
made
his
abode
and
bedchamber
furnished
with
homely
comfort
answered
to
his
bachelor
needs
and
would
allow
of
his
receiving
without
embarrassment
any
visitor
whom
fortune
might
send
him
of
quietness
he
was
assured
for
a
widow
and
her
son
alike
remarkable
for
sobriety
of
demeanour
were
the
only
persons
who
shared
the
house
with
him
mrs
roots
could
not
compare
in
grace
and
skill
with
the
little
frenchwoman
who
had
sweetened
his
existence
at
peckham
rye
but
her
zeal
made
amends
for
natural
deficiency
and
the
timorous
respect
with
which
she
waited
upon
him
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
godwin
her
reply
to
a
request
or
suggestion
was
always
you
please
sir
throughout
the
day
she
went
so
tranquilly
about
her
domestic
duties
that
godwin
seldom
heard
anything
except
the
voice
of
the
a
pleasant
sound
to
him
her
son
employed
at
a
nurseryman
was
a
great
sinewy
fellow
with
a
face
of
such
ruddiness
that
it
seemed
to
diffuse
warmth
on
sunday
afternoon
whatever
the
state
of
the
sky
he
sat
behind
the
house
in
his
and
smoked
a
pipe
as
he
contemplated
the
which
grew
there
upon
a
rockery
gentleman
from
london
so
mrs
roots
was
wont
to
style
her
lodger
in
speaking
with
neighbours
had
brought
his
books
with
him
they
found
place
on
a
few
shelves
his
microscope
had
its
stand
by
the
window
and
one
or
two
other
scientific
implements
lay
about
the
room
the
cabinets
bequeathed
to
him
by
gunnery
he
had
sent
to
twybridge
to
remain
in
his
mother
care
in
taking
the
lodgings
he
described
himself
merely
as
a
student
and
gave
his
landlady
to
understand
that
he
hoped
to
remain
under
her
roof
for
at
least
a
year
of
his
extreme
respectability
the
widow
could
entertain
no
doubt
for
he
dressed
with
aristocratic
finish
attended
services
at
the
cathedral
and
elsewhere
very
frequently
and
made
the
most
punctual
payments
moreover
a
casual
remark
had
informed
her
that
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
martin
warricombe
whom
her
son
knew
as
a
gentleman
of
distinction
he
often
sat
up
very
late
at
night
but
doubtless
that
was
the
practice
of
londoners
no
lodger
could
have
given
less
trouble
or
have
acknowledged
with
more
courtesy
all
that
was
done
for
his
convenience
no
one
ever
called
upon
mr
peak
but
he
was
often
from
home
for
many
hours
together
probably
on
visits
to
great
people
in
city
or
country
it
seemed
rather
strange
however
that
the
postman
so
seldom
brought
anything
for
him
though
he
had
now
been
more
than
two
months
in
the
house
he
had
received
only
three
letters
and
those
at
long
intervals
noticeable
was
the
improvement
in
his
health
since
his
arrival
here
the
pallor
of
his
cheeks
was
giving
place
to
a
wholesome
tinge
his
eye
was
brighter
he
showed
more
disposition
to
converse
and
was
readier
with
pleasant
smiles
mrs
roots
even
heard
him
singing
in
his
bedroom
though
oddly
enough
it
was
a
secular
song
on
sunday
morning
the
weekly
bills
for
food
which
at
first
had
been
very
modest
grew
richer
in
items
godwin
had
in
fact
never
felt
so
well
he
extended
his
walks
in
every
direction
sometimes
rambling
up
the
valley
to
sleepy
little
towns
where
he
could
rest
in
the
parlours
of
old
inns
sometimes
striking
across
country
to
this
or
that
point
of
the
or
making
his
way
to
the
nearer
summits
of
dartmoor
noble
in
their
wintry
desolation
he
marked
with
delight
every
promise
of
returning
spring
when
he
could
only
grant
himself
a
walk
of
an
hour
or
two
in
the
sunny
afternoon
there
was
many
a
deep
lane
within
easy
reach
where
the
gorse
gleamed
in
masses
of
gold
and
the
little
in
the
hedges
were
ruddy
with
last
year
clinging
leafage
and
catkins
hung
from
the
hazels
and
the
fresh
green
of
sprouting
ivy
crept
over
bank
and
wall
had
he
now
been
in
london
the
morning
would
have
awakened
him
to
the
glow
of
sunrise
he
felt
the
sweet
air
breathing
health
into
fog
and
slush
and
misery
as
it
was
when
he
looked
out
upon
his
frame
and
vigour
into
his
mind
there
were
moments
when
he
could
all
but
say
of
himself
that
he
was
at
peace
with
the
world
as
on
a
morning
towards
the
end
of
march
when
a
wind
from
the
atlantic
swept
spaces
of
brightest
blue
amid
the
speeding
clouds
and
sang
joyously
as
it
rushed
over
hill
and
dale
it
was
the
very
day
for
an
upland
walk
for
a
putting
forth
of
one
strength
in
conflict
with
boisterous
gusts
and
sudden
showers
that
give
a
taste
of
nourishment
but
godwin
had
something
else
in
view
after
breakfast
he
sat
down
to
finish
a
piece
of
work
which
had
occupied
him
for
two
or
three
days
a
translation
from
a
german
periodical
his
mind
wrought
easily
and
he
often
hummed
an
air
as
his
pen
moved
over
the
paper
when
the
task
was
completed
he
rolled
his
papers
and
the
pamphlet
together
put
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
presently
went
forth
twenty
minutes
walk
brought
him
to
the
warricombes
house
it
was
his
second
call
within
the
present
week
but
such
assiduity
had
not
hitherto
been
his
wont
though
already
summoned
twice
or
thrice
by
express
invitation
he
was
sparing
of
voluntary
visits
having
asked
for
warricombe
he
was
forthwith
conducted
to
the
study
in
the
welcome
which
greeted
his
appearance
he
could
detect
no
suspicion
of
simulated
warmth
though
his
ear
had
unsurpassable
discrimination
you
looked
through
it
martin
exclaimed
as
he
saw
the
foreign
periodical
in
his
visitor
hand
have
written
a
rough
translation
how
could
you
think
of
taking
such
trouble
these
things
are
sent
to
me
by
the
dozen
i
might
say
by
the
cartload
my
curiosity
would
have
been
amply
satisfied
if
you
had
just
told
me
the
drift
of
the
thing
seemed
to
me
said
peak
modestly
the
paper
was
worth
a
little
careful
thought
i
read
it
rapidly
at
first
but
found
myself
drawn
to
it
again
it
states
the
point
of
view
of
the
average
scientific
mind
with
such
remarkable
clearness
that
i
wished
to
think
it
over
and
the
best
way
was
to
do
so
pen
in
hand
if
you
really
did
it
on
your
own
account
warricombe
took
the
offered
sheets
and
glanced
at
the
first
of
them
only
purpose
said
godwin
calling
again
so
soon
was
to
leave
this
with
you
he
made
as
though
he
would
take
his
departure
want
to
get
home
again
wait
at
least
till
this
shower
is
over
i
enjoy
that
pelting
of
spring
rain
against
the
window
in
a
minute
or
two
we
shall
have
the
laurels
flashing
in
the
sunshine
as
if
they
were
hung
with
diamonds
they
stood
together
looking
out
on
to
the
garden
presently
their
talk
returned
to
the
german
disquisition
which
was
directed
against
the
class
of
authors
attacked
by
peak
himself
in
his
article
in
the
end
godwin
sat
down
and
began
to
read
the
translation
he
had
made
warricombe
listening
with
a
thoughtful
smile
from
time
to
time
the
reader
paused
and
offered
a
comment
endeavouring
to
show
that
the
arguments
were
merely
plausible
his
air
was
that
of
placid
security
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
irony
which
often
fell
from
his
lips
martin
frequently
scrutinised
him
and
always
with
a
look
of
interest
which
betokened
grave
reflection
said
godwin
at
one
point
has
a
note
citing
a
passage
from
reusch
book
on
bible
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
misrepresents
his
author
though
perhaps
not
intentionally
know
the
book
have
studied
it
carefully
but
i
do
possess
it
i
thought
i
remembered
this
particular
passage
very
well
it
a
work
of
authority
it
is
very
important
unfortunately
it
has
yet
been
translated
rather
bulky
but
i
should
mind
doing
it
myself
if
i
were
sure
of
finding
a
publisher
bible
and
said
martin
musingly
is
his
scheme
how
does
he
go
to
work
godwin
gave
a
brief
but
lucid
description
of
the
book
and
mr
warricombe
listened
gravely
when
there
had
been
silence
for
some
moments
the
latter
spoke
in
a
tone
he
had
never
yet
used
when
conversing
with
peak
he
allowed
himself
for
the
first
time
to
betray
a
troubled
doubt
on
the
subject
under
discussion
he
makes
a
stand
at
darwinism
as
it
affects
man
peak
had
yet
no
means
of
knowing
at
what
point
martin
himself
a
stand
modes
of
reconcilement
between
scientific
discovery
and
religious
tradition
are
so
very
numerous
and
the
geologist
was
only
now
beginning
to
touch
upon
these
topics
with
his
young
acquaintance
that
his
mind
was
not
perfectly
at
ease
amid
the
conflicts
of
the
day
godwin
soon
perceived
and
by
this
time
he
had
clear
assurance
that
martin
would
willingly
thrash
out
the
whole
debate
with
anyone
who
seemed
capable
of
supporting
orthodox
tenets
by
reasoning
not
unacceptable
to
a
man
of
broad
views
the
negativist
of
course
assumed
from
the
first
that
martin
however
respectable
his
knowledge
was
far
from
possessing
the
scientific
mind
and
each
conversation
had
supplied
him
with
proofs
of
this
defect
it
was
not
at
all
in
the
modern
spirit
that
the
man
of
threescore
years
pursued
his
geological
and
kindred
researches
but
with
the
calm
curiosity
of
a
liberal
intellect
which
has
somehow
taken
this
direction
instead
of
devoting
itself
to
literary
study
at
bottom
godwin
had
no
little
sympathy
with
warricombe
he
too
in
spite
of
his
militant
instincts
dwelt
by
preference
amid
purely
human
interests
he
grasped
with
firm
intelligence
the
modes
of
thought
which
distinguish
scientific
men
but
his
nature
did
not
prompt
him
to
a
consistent
application
of
them
personal
liking
enabled
him
to
subdue
the
impulses
of
disrespect
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
act
with
perfection
his
present
part
none
the
less
his
task
was
one
of
infinite
delicacy
martin
warricombe
was
not
the
man
to
unbosom
himself
on
trivial
instigation
it
must
be
a
powerful
influence
which
would
persuade
him
to
reveal
whatever
lay
beneath
his
genial
good
breeding
and
acquiescence
in
a
practical
philosophy
godwin
guarded
himself
against
his
eager
emotions
one
false
note
one
syllable
of
indiscretion
and
his
aims
might
be
hopelessly
defeated
was
his
reply
to
the
hesitating
question
argues
strenuously
against
the
descent
of
man
if
i
understand
him
he
regards
the
concession
of
this
point
as
impossible
martin
was
deep
in
thought
he
held
a
bent
upon
his
knee
and
his
smooth
delicate
features
wore
an
unquiet
smile
you
know
hebrew
mr
peak
the
question
came
unexpectedly
and
godwin
could
not
help
a
momentary
confusion
but
he
covered
it
with
the
tone
of
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
am
only
now
taking
it
up
seriously
do
think
you
need
be
ashamed
said
martin
a
mind
as
active
as
yours
must
postpone
some
studies
reusch
i
suppose
is
sound
on
that
head
the
inquiry
struck
godwin
as
significant
so
warricombe
attached
importance
to
the
verbal
interpretation
of
the
old
testament
an
authority
he
replied
devotes
whole
chapters
to
a
minute
examination
of
the
text
you
had
more
leisure
martin
began
deliberately
when
he
had
again
reflected
should
be
disposed
to
urge
you
to
undertake
that
translation
peak
appeared
to
meditate
the
book
been
used
by
english
writers
the
other
inquired
good
it
was
published
in
the
sixties
but
i
read
it
in
a
new
edition
dated
a
few
years
ago
reusch
has
kept
pace
with
the
men
of
science
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
compare
the
first
form
of
the
book
with
the
latest
would
very
raising
his
head
from
the
contemplative
posture
godwin
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
of
zeal
think
i
must
find
time
to
translate
him
at
all
events
i
might
address
a
proposal
to
some
likely
publisher
yet
i
do
know
how
i
should
assure
him
of
my
competency
a
specimen
would
be
the
surest
testimony
i
might
do
a
few
chapters
warricombe
lapse
into
silence
and
brevities
intimated
to
godwin
that
it
was
time
to
take
leave
he
always
quitted
this
room
with
reluctance
its
air
of
luxurious
culture
affected
his
senses
deliciously
and
he
hoped
that
he
might
some
day
be
permitted
to
linger
among
the
cabinets
and
the
library
shelves
there
were
so
many
books
he
would
have
liked
to
take
down
some
with
titles
familiar
to
him
others
which
kindled
his
curiosity
when
he
chanced
to
observe
them
the
library
abounded
in
such
works
as
only
a
wealthy
man
can
purchase
and
godwin
who
had
examined
some
of
them
at
the
british
museum
was
filled
with
the
humaner
kind
of
envy
on
seeing
them
in
possession
those
publications
of
the
palaeontological
society
one
volume
of
which
a
part
of
davidson
superb
work
on
the
even
now
lay
open
within
sight
his
hand
trembled
with
a
desire
to
touch
them
and
those
maps
of
the
geological
surveys
british
and
foreign
how
he
would
have
enjoyed
a
day
poring
over
them
he
rose
but
martin
seemed
in
no
haste
to
bring
the
conversation
to
an
end
you
read
book
you
see
the
savage
attack
in
not
long
ago
godwin
smiled
and
made
quiet
answer
should
think
it
was
the
last
word
of
scientific
bitterness
and
intolerance
repeated
martin
doubtfully
do
think
the
writer
was
a
man
of
science
i
saw
it
somewhere
attributed
to
huxley
but
that
was
preposterous
to
begin
with
huxley
would
have
signed
his
name
and
again
his
english
is
better
the
article
seemed
to
me
to
be
stamped
with
literary
rancour
it
was
written
by
some
man
who
envies
success
peak
kept
silence
martin
censure
of
the
anonymous
author
style
stung
him
to
the
quick
and
he
had
much
ado
to
command
his
countenance
pursued
the
other
felt
that
much
of
his
satire
was
only
too
well
pointed
is
suggestive
but
one
comes
across
books
of
the
same
purpose
which
can
have
no
result
but
to
injure
their
cause
with
all
thinking
people
have
seen
many
such
remarked
godwin
warricombe
stepped
to
a
bookcase
and
took
down
a
small
volume
wonder
whether
you
know
this
book
of
ampare
grace
rome
et
delightful
for
odd
moments
there
came
into
my
mind
a
passage
here
at
the
beginning
apropos
of
what
we
were
saying
faut
souvent
un
vrai
courage
pour
persister
dans
une
opinion
juste
en
depit
de
ses
is
that
capital
peak
received
it
with
genuine
appreciation
for
once
he
was
able
to
laugh
unfeignedly
the
aphorism
had
so
many
applications
from
his
own
point
of
view
i
do
remember
to
have
seen
the
book
it
if
you
care
to
this
offer
seemed
a
distinct
advance
in
warricombe
friendliness
godwin
felt
a
thrill
of
encouragement
you
will
let
me
keep
this
translation
for
a
day
or
two
martin
added
indicating
the
sheets
of
manuscript
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
enabling
me
to
read
the
thing
they
shook
hands
godwin
had
entertained
a
slight
hope
that
he
might
be
asked
to
stay
to
luncheon
but
it
could
not
be
much
past
twelve
and
on
the
whole
there
was
every
reason
for
feeling
satisfied
with
the
results
of
his
visit
before
long
he
would
probably
receive
another
invitation
to
dine
so
with
light
step
he
went
out
into
the
hall
where
martin
again
shook
hands
with
him
the
sky
had
darkened
over
and
a
shrilling
of
the
wind
sounded
through
the
garden
foliage
fir
and
cypress
and
laurel
just
as
godwin
reached
the
gate
he
was
met
by
miss
warricombe
and
fanny
who
were
returning
from
a
walk
they
wore
the
costume
appropriate
to
march
weather
in
the
country
defiant
of
gusts
and
their
cheeks
glowed
with
health
as
he
exchanged
greetings
with
them
peak
received
a
new
impression
of
the
sisters
he
admired
the
physical
vigour
which
enabled
them
to
take
delight
in
such
a
day
as
this
when
girls
of
poorer
blood
and
ignoble
nurture
would
shrink
from
the
showery
tumult
and
protect
their
surface
elegance
by
the
fireside
impossible
for
sidwell
and
fanny
to
be
anything
but
graceful
for
at
all
times
they
were
perfectly
unaffected
be
another
storm
in
a
minute
said
the
younger
of
them
looking
with
interest
to
the
quarter
whence
the
wind
came
suddenly
they
burst
what
a
rush
and
then
in
five
minutes
the
sky
is
clear
again
her
eyes
shone
as
she
turned
laughingly
to
peak
not
afraid
of
getting
wet
had
you
better
come
under
cover
it
is
exclaimed
sidwell
with
quieter
enjoyment
shelter
for
a
minute
or
two
mr
peak
they
led
the
way
to
the
portico
where
godwin
stood
with
them
and
watched
the
squall
a
moment
downpour
of
furious
rain
was
followed
by
heavy
hailstones
which
drove
horizontally
before
the
shrieking
wind
the
prospect
had
wrapped
itself
in
grey
gloom
at
a
hundred
distance
scarcely
an
object
could
be
distinguished
the
swooped
so
low
that
its
skirts
touched
the
branches
of
tall
elms
a
streaming
rushing
raggedness
you
enjoy
that
fanny
asked
of
godwin
i
do
should
be
on
dartmoor
in
such
weather
said
sidwell
and
i
were
once
caught
in
storms
far
worse
than
this
far
better
i
ought
to
say
for
i
never
knew
anything
so
terrifically
grand
already
it
was
over
the
gusts
diminished
in
frequency
and
force
the
hail
ceased
the
core
of
blackness
was
passing
over
to
the
eastern
sky
fanny
ran
out
into
the
garden
and
pointed
upward
where
the
sunlight
is
coming
an
uncloaked
patch
of
heaven
shone
with
colour
like
that
of
the
eyes
faint
limpid
blue
reminding
himself
that
to
tarry
longer
in
this
company
would
be
imprudent
godwin
bade
the
sisters
the
frank
heartiness
with
which
fanny
pressed
his
hand
sent
him
on
his
way
exultant
not
too
strong
a
word
for
independently
of
his
wider
ambitions
he
was
moved
and
gratified
by
the
thought
that
kindly
feeling
towards
him
had
sprung
up
in
such
a
heart
as
this
nor
did
conscience
so
much
as
whisper
a
reproach
with
unreflecting
ingenuousness
he
tasted
the
joy
as
if
it
were
his
right
thus
long
he
had
waited
through
years
of
hungry
manhood
for
the
look
the
tone
which
were
in
harmony
with
his
native
sensibilities
fanny
warricombe
was
but
an
undeveloped
girl
yet
he
valued
her
friendship
above
the
passionate
attachment
of
any
woman
bred
on
a
lower
social
plane
had
it
been
possible
he
would
have
kissed
her
fingers
with
purest
reverence
when
out
of
sight
of
the
house
he
paused
to
regard
the
sky
again
its
noontide
splendour
was
dazzling
masses
of
rosy
cloud
sailed
swiftly
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
azure
deepening
about
them
yet
before
long
the
west
would
again
send
forth
its
turbulent
spirits
and
so
the
girls
might
perhaps
be
led
to
think
of
him
by
night
the
weather
grew
more
tranquil
there
was
a
full
moon
and
its
radiance
illumined
the
face
of
heaven
with
rare
grandeur
godwin
could
not
shut
himself
up
over
his
books
he
wandered
far
away
into
the
country
and
let
his
thoughts
have
freedom
he
was
learning
to
review
with
calmness
the
course
by
which
he
had
reached
his
now
steadfast
resolve
a
revulsion
such
as
he
had
experienced
after
his
first
day
of
simulated
orthodoxy
half
a
year
ago
could
not
be
of
lasting
effect
for
it
was
opposed
to
the
whole
tenor
of
his
mature
thought
it
spoilt
his
holiday
but
had
no
chance
of
persisting
after
his
return
to
the
atmosphere
of
rotherhithe
that
he
should
have
been
capable
of
such
emotion
was
he
said
to
himself
in
the
just
order
of
things
callousness
in
the
first
stages
of
an
undertaking
which
demanded
gross
hypocrisy
would
signify
an
ignoble
nature
a
nature
indeed
which
could
never
have
been
submitted
to
trial
of
so
strange
a
kind
but
he
had
overcome
himself
that
phase
of
difficulty
was
outlived
and
henceforth
he
saw
only
the
material
obstacles
to
be
defied
by
his
vindicated
will
what
he
proposed
to
himself
was
a
life
of
deliberate
baseness
godwin
peak
never
tried
to
play
the
sophist
with
this
fact
but
he
succeeded
in
justifying
himself
by
a
consideration
of
the
circumstances
which
had
compelled
him
to
a
vile
expedient
had
his
project
involved
conscious
wrong
to
other
persons
he
would
scarcely
even
have
speculated
on
its
possibilities
he
was
convinced
that
no
mortal
could
suffer
harm
even
if
he
accomplished
the
uttermost
of
his
desires
whom
was
he
in
danger
of
wronging
the
conventional
moralist
would
cry
everyone
with
whom
he
came
in
slightest
contact
but
a
mind
such
as
peak
has
very
little
to
do
with
conventional
morality
injury
to
himself
he
foresaw
and
accepted
he
could
never
be
the
man
nature
designed
in
him
and
he
must
frequently
submit
to
a
which
would
be
very
hard
to
bear
those
whom
he
consistently
deceived
how
would
they
suffer
martin
warricombe
to
begin
with
martin
was
a
man
who
had
lived
his
life
and
whose
chief
care
would
now
be
to
keep
his
mind
at
rest
in
the
faiths
which
had
served
him
from
youth
onwards
in
that
very
purpose
godwin
believed
he
could
assist
him
to
see
a
young
man
of
strong
and
trained
intellect
championing
the
old
beliefs
must
doubtless
be
a
source
of
reassurance
to
one
in
martin
position
reassurance
derived
from
a
lie
and
what
matter
if
the
outcome
were
genuine
if
it
lasted
until
the
man
himself
was
no
more
did
not
every
form
of
content
result
from
illusion
what
was
truth
without
the
mind
of
the
believer
society
then
at
all
events
that
part
of
it
likely
to
be
affected
by
his
activity
suppose
him
an
ordained
priest
performing
all
the
functions
implied
in
that
office
why
to
think
only
of
examples
recognised
by
the
public
at
large
how
would
he
differ
for
the
worse
from
this
that
and
the
other
clergyman
who
taught
christianity
all
but
with
blunt
avowal
as
a
scheme
of
human
ethics
no
wolf
in
clothing
he
he
plotted
against
no
man
pocket
no
woman
honour
he
had
no
sinister
design
of
sapping
the
faith
of
congregations
a
scheme
which
fanatic
liberators
might
undertake
with
vast
if
by
a
word
he
could
have
banished
religious
dogma
from
the
minds
of
the
multitude
he
would
not
have
cared
to
utter
it
wherein
lay
indeed
a
scruple
to
be
surmounted
the
christian
priest
must
be
a
man
of
humble
temper
he
must
be
willing
even
eager
to
sit
down
among
the
poor
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
estate
and
impart
to
them
his
unworldly
solaces
yes
but
it
had
always
been
recognised
that
some
men
who
could
do
the
church
good
service
were
personally
unfitted
for
those
meek
ministrations
his
place
was
in
the
hierarchy
of
intellect
if
he
were
to
be
active
at
all
it
must
be
with
the
brain
in
his
conversation
with
buckland
warricombe
last
october
he
had
spoken
not
altogether
insincerely
let
him
once
be
a
member
of
the
church
militant
and
his
heart
would
go
with
many
a
stroke
against
that
democratic
movement
which
desired
among
other
things
the
abolition
he
had
power
of
utterance
roused
to
combat
by
the
proletarian
challenge
he
could
make
his
voice
ring
in
the
ears
of
men
even
though
he
used
a
symbolism
which
he
would
not
by
choice
have
adopted
for
it
was
natural
that
he
should
anticipate
distinction
whatever
his
lot
in
life
he
would
not
be
able
to
rest
among
an
inglorious
brotherhood
if
he
allied
himself
with
the
church
the
church
must
assign
him
leadership
whether
titular
or
not
was
of
small
moment
in
days
to
come
let
people
if
they
would
debate
his
history
canvass
his
convictions
his
scornful
pride
invited
any
degree
of
publicity
when
once
his
position
was
secure
but
in
the
meantime
he
was
leaving
aside
the
most
powerful
of
all
his
motives
and
one
which
demanded
closest
scrutiny
not
ambition
in
any
ordinary
sense
not
desire
of
material
luxury
no
incentive
recognised
by
unprincipled
schemers
first
suggested
his
dishonour
this
edifice
of
subtle
untruth
had
for
its
foundation
a
mere
ideal
of
sexual
love
for
the
winning
of
some
chosen
woman
men
have
wrought
vehemently
have
ruined
themselves
and
others
have
achieved
triumphs
noble
or
degrading
but
godwin
peak
had
for
years
contemplated
the
possibility
of
baseness
at
the
impulse
of
a
craving
for
love
capable
only
of
a
social
one
might
say
of
a
political
definition
the
woman
throned
in
his
imagination
was
no
individual
but
the
type
of
an
order
so
strangely
had
circumstances
moulded
him
that
he
could
not
brood
on
a
desire
of
spiritual
affinities
could
not
as
is
natural
to
most
cultivated
men
inflame
himself
with
the
ardour
of
soul
reaching
to
soul
he
was
with
the
contemplation
of
qualities
which
characterise
a
class
the
sense
of
social
distinctions
was
so
burnt
into
him
that
he
could
not
be
affected
by
any
pictured
charm
of
mind
or
person
in
a
woman
who
had
not
the
stamp
of
gentle
birth
and
breeding
if
once
he
were
admitted
to
the
intimacy
of
such
women
then
indeed
the
canons
of
selection
would
have
weight
with
him
no
man
more
capable
of
disinterested
choice
till
then
the
ideal
which
possessed
him
was
merely
such
an
assemblage
of
qualities
as
would
excite
the
democrat
to
disdain
or
fury
in
sidwell
warricombe
this
ideal
found
an
embodiment
but
godwin
did
not
thereupon
come
to
the
conclusion
that
sidwell
was
the
wife
he
desired
her
influence
had
the
effect
of
deciding
his
career
but
he
neither
imagined
himself
in
love
with
her
nor
tried
to
believe
that
he
might
win
her
love
if
he
set
himself
to
the
endeavour
for
the
first
time
he
was
admitted
to
familiar
intercourse
with
a
woman
whom
he
make
the
object
of
his
worship
he
thought
much
of
her
day
and
night
her
figure
stood
before
him
and
this
had
continued
now
for
half
a
year
still
he
neither
was
nor
dreamt
himself
in
love
with
her
before
long
his
acquaintance
would
include
many
of
her
like
and
at
any
moment
sidwell
might
pale
in
the
splendour
of
another
loveliness
but
what
reasoning
could
defend
the
winning
of
a
wife
by
false
pretences
this
his
final
aim
could
hardly
be
achieved
without
grave
wrong
to
the
person
whose
welfare
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
a
prime
motive
with
him
the
deception
he
had
practised
must
sooner
or
later
be
discovered
lifelong
hypocrisy
was
incompatible
with
perfect
marriage
some
day
he
must
either
involve
his
wife
in
a
system
of
dishonour
or
with
her
consent
relinquish
the
false
career
and
find
his
happiness
in
the
obscurity
to
which
he
would
then
be
relegated
admit
the
wrong
grant
that
some
woman
whom
he
loved
supremely
must
on
his
account
pass
through
a
harsh
trial
would
it
not
be
in
his
power
to
compensate
her
amply
the
wife
whom
he
imagined
his
idealism
in
this
matter
was
of
a
crudity
which
made
the
strangest
contrast
with
his
habits
of
thought
on
every
other
subject
would
be
ruled
by
her
emotions
and
that
part
of
her
nature
would
be
wholly
under
his
governance
religious
fanaticism
could
not
exist
in
her
for
in
that
case
she
would
never
have
attracted
him
little
by
little
she
would
learn
to
think
as
he
did
and
her
devotedness
must
lead
her
to
pardon
his
deliberate
insincerities
godwin
had
absolute
faith
in
his
power
of
dominating
the
woman
whom
he
should
inspire
with
tenderness
this
was
a
feature
of
his
egoism
the
explanation
of
those
manifold
inconsistencies
inseparable
from
his
tortuous
design
he
regarded
his
love
as
something
so
rare
so
vehement
so
exalting
that
its
bestowal
must
seem
an
abundant
recompense
for
any
pain
of
which
he
was
the
cause
thus
with
perfect
sincerity
of
argument
did
godwin
peak
face
the
undertaking
to
which
he
was
committed
incidents
might
perturb
him
but
his
position
was
no
longer
a
cause
of
uneasiness
save
indeed
at
those
moments
when
he
feared
lest
any
of
his
old
acquaintances
might
hear
of
him
before
time
was
ripe
this
was
a
source
of
anxiety
but
inevitable
one
of
the
risks
he
dared
had
it
seemed
possible
he
would
have
kept
even
from
his
mother
the
secret
of
his
residence
at
exeter
but
this
would
have
necessitated
the
establishment
of
some
indirect
means
of
communication
with
her
a
troublesome
and
uncertain
expedient
he
shrank
from
leaving
her
in
ignorance
of
his
whereabouts
and
from
passing
a
year
or
two
without
knowledge
of
her
condition
and
on
the
whole
there
could
not
be
much
danger
in
this
correspondence
the
moxeys
who
alone
of
his
friends
had
ever
been
connected
with
twybridge
were
now
absolutely
without
interests
in
that
quarter
from
them
he
had
stolen
away
only
acquainting
christian
at
the
last
moment
in
a
short
letter
with
his
departure
from
london
will
be
a
long
time
before
we
again
see
each
other
at
least
i
think
so
do
trouble
your
head
about
me
i
promise
to
write
and
shall
be
sorry
not
to
hear
how
things
go
with
you
but
may
all
happen
as
you
wish
in
the
same
way
he
had
dealt
with
earwaker
except
that
his
letter
to
staple
inn
was
much
longer
and
contained
hints
which
the
philosophic
journalist
might
perchance
truly
interpret
he
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
you
know
the
old
song
i
have
set
out
on
my
life
adventure
i
have
gone
to
seek
that
without
which
life
is
no
longer
worth
having
forgive
my
shabby
treatment
of
you
old
friend
you
can
not
help
me
and
your
displeasure
would
be
a
hindrance
in
my
path
a
last
piece
of
counsel
throw
overboard
the
weekly
rag
and
write
for
people
capable
of
understanding
you
earwaker
was
not
at
all
likely
to
institute
a
search
he
would
accept
the
situation
and
wait
with
quiet
curiosity
for
its
upshot
no
doubt
he
and
moxey
would
discuss
the
affair
together
and
any
desire
christian
might
have
to
hunt
for
his
vanished
comrade
would
yield
before
the
journalist
surmises
no
one
else
had
any
serious
reason
for
making
inquiries
probably
he
might
dwell
in
devonshire
as
long
as
he
chose
without
fear
of
encountering
anyone
from
his
old
world
occasionally
as
under
the
full
moon
he
was
able
to
cast
off
every
form
of
trouble
and
rejoice
in
his
seeming
liberty
though
every
step
in
the
life
before
him
was
an
uncertainty
an
appeal
to
fortune
his
faith
in
himself
grasped
strongly
at
assurance
of
success
once
more
he
felt
himself
a
young
man
with
unwearied
energies
he
had
shaken
off
the
burden
of
those
ten
frustrate
years
and
kept
only
their
harvest
of
experience
old
in
one
sense
in
another
youthful
he
had
vast
advantages
over
such
men
as
would
henceforth
be
his
competitors
the
complex
brain
the
fiery
heart
passion
to
desire
and
skill
in
attempting
if
with
such
endowment
he
could
not
win
the
prize
which
most
men
claim
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
a
wife
of
social
instincts
correspondent
with
his
own
he
must
indeed
be
luckless
but
he
was
not
doomed
to
defeat
foretaste
of
triumph
urged
the
current
of
his
blood
and
inflamed
him
with
exquisite
ardour
he
sang
aloud
in
the
still
lanes
the
hymns
of
youth
and
of
love
and
when
weariness
brought
him
back
to
his
lonely
dwelling
he
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
slept
in
dreamless
calm
as
for
the
details
of
his
advance
towards
the
clerical
state
he
had
decided
to
resume
his
career
at
the
point
where
it
was
interrupted
by
andrew
peak
twice
had
his
education
received
a
check
from
hostile
circumstances
when
domestic
poverty
compelled
him
to
leave
school
for
moxey
service
and
when
shame
drove
him
from
whitelaw
college
in
reflecting
upon
his
own
character
and
his
lot
he
gave
much
weight
to
these
irregularities
no
doubt
with
justice
in
both
cases
he
was
turned
aside
from
the
way
of
natural
development
and
opportunity
he
would
now
complete
his
academic
course
by
taking
the
london
degree
at
which
he
had
long
ago
aimed
the
preliminary
examination
might
without
difficulty
be
passed
this
summer
and
next
year
he
might
write
himself
bachelor
of
arts
a
return
to
the
studies
of
boyhood
probably
accounted
in
some
measure
for
the
frequent
gaiety
which
he
attributed
to
improving
health
and
revived
hopes
everything
he
undertook
was
easy
to
him
and
by
a
pleasant
he
made
the
passing
of
a
school
task
his
augury
of
success
in
greater
things
during
the
spring
he
was
indebted
to
the
warricombes
friendship
for
several
new
acquaintances
a
clergyman
named
lilywhite
often
at
the
warricombes
house
made
friendly
overtures
to
him
the
connection
might
be
a
useful
one
and
godwin
made
the
most
of
it
lilywhite
was
a
man
of
forty
well
read
of
scientific
tastes
an
active
pedestrian
peak
had
no
difficulty
in
associating
with
him
on
amicable
terms
with
lilywhite
the
mother
of
six
children
and
possessed
of
many
virtues
he
presently
became
a
favourite
she
saw
in
him
great
deal
of
quiet
moral
force
one
or
two
families
of
good
standing
made
him
welcome
at
their
houses
society
is
very
kind
to
those
who
seek
its
benefits
with
recognised
credentials
the
more
he
saw
of
these
wealthy
and
tranquil
people
the
more
fervently
did
he
admire
the
gracefulness
of
their
existence
he
had
not
set
before
himself
an
imaginary
ideal
the
girls
and
women
were
sweet
gentle
perfect
in
manner
and
within
limits
of
bright
intelligence
he
was
conscious
of
benefiting
greatly
and
not
alone
in
things
extrinsic
by
the
atmosphere
of
such
homes
nature
progress
towards
summer
kept
him
in
a
mood
of
healthful
enjoyment
from
the
window
of
his
he
looked
over
the
opposite
houses
to
northernhay
the
hill
where
once
stood
rougemont
castle
its
wooded
declivities
now
fashioned
into
a
public
garden
he
watched
the
rooks
at
their
building
in
the
great
elms
and
was
gladdened
when
the
naked
branches
began
to
deck
themselves
day
by
day
the
fresh
verdure
swelling
into
soft
graceful
outline
in
his
walks
he
pried
eagerly
for
the
first
violet
welcomed
the
earliest
blackthorn
blossom
every
common
flower
of
field
and
hedgerow
gave
him
a
new
keen
pleasure
as
was
to
be
expected
he
found
the
same
impulses
strong
in
sidwell
warricombe
and
her
sister
sidwell
could
tell
him
of
secret
spots
where
the
made
haste
to
flower
or
where
the
white
violet
breathed
its
fragrance
in
security
from
common
pilferers
here
was
the
safest
and
pleasantest
matter
for
conversation
he
knew
that
on
such
topics
he
could
talk
agreeably
enough
revealing
without
stress
or
importunity
his
tastes
his
powers
his
attainments
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
sidwell
listened
with
growing
interest
most
certainly
her
father
encouraged
his
visits
to
the
house
and
warricombe
behaved
to
him
with
increase
of
suavity
in
the
meantime
he
had
purchased
a
copy
of
reusch
und
and
had
made
a
translation
of
some
fifty
pages
this
experiment
he
submitted
to
a
london
publishing
house
with
proposals
for
the
completion
of
the
work
without
much
delay
there
came
a
civil
letter
of
excuse
and
with
it
the
sample
returned
another
attempt
again
met
with
rejection
this
failure
did
not
trouble
him
what
he
really
desired
was
to
read
through
his
version
of
reusch
with
martin
warricombe
and
before
long
he
had
brought
it
to
pass
that
martin
requested
a
perusal
of
the
manuscript
as
it
advanced
which
it
did
but
slowly
godwin
durst
not
endanger
his
success
in
the
examination
by
encroaching
upon
hours
of
necessary
study
his
leisure
was
largely
sacrificed
to
und
and
many
an
evening
of
calm
golden
loveliness
when
he
longed
to
be
amid
the
fields
passed
in
vexatious
imprisonment
the
name
of
reusch
grew
odious
to
him
and
he
revenged
himself
for
the
hypocrisy
of
other
hours
by
fierce
scorn
cast
audibly
at
this
laborious
exegetist
chapter
iii
it
occasionally
happens
that
a
woman
whose
early
life
has
been
directed
by
native
silliness
and
social
bias
will
submit
to
a
tardy
education
at
the
hands
of
her
own
children
thus
was
it
with
mrs
warricombe
she
came
of
a
race
long
established
in
squirearchic
dignity
amid
heaths
and
woodlands
her
breeding
was
pure
through
many
generations
of
the
paternal
and
maternal
lines
representative
of
a
physical
type
fortified
in
the
males
by
much
companionship
with
horse
and
hound
and
by
the
corresponding
country
pursuits
of
dowered
daughters
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
she
had
no
charms
of
person
more
remarkable
than
rosy
comeliness
and
the
symmetry
of
supple
limb
as
for
the
nurture
of
her
mind
it
had
been
intrusted
to
of
respectable
incapacity
martin
warricombe
married
her
because
she
was
one
of
a
little
circle
of
girls
much
alike
as
to
birth
and
fortune
with
whom
he
had
grown
up
in
familiar
communication
timidity
imposed
restraints
upon
him
which
made
his
choice
almost
a
matter
of
accident
as
befalls
often
enough
the
betrothal
became
an
accomplished
fact
whilst
he
was
still
doubting
whether
he
desired
it
or
not
when
the
fervour
of
early
wedlock
was
outlived
he
had
no
difficulty
in
accepting
as
a
matter
of
course
that
his
life
companion
should
be
hopelessly
illogical
and
at
heart
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
small
graces
and
substantial
comforts
of
provincial
existence
one
of
the
advantages
of
wealth
is
that
it
allows
husband
and
wife
to
keep
a
great
deal
apart
without
any
show
of
mutual
unkindness
a
condition
essential
to
happiness
in
marriage
time
fostered
in
them
a
calm
attachment
independent
of
spiritual
sympathy
satisfied
with
a
common
regard
for
domestic
honour
not
that
warricombe
remained
in
complete
ignorance
of
her
husband
pursuits
social
forms
would
scarcely
have
allowed
this
seeing
that
she
was
in
constant
intercourse
as
hostess
or
guest
with
martin
scientific
friends
of
fossils
she
necessarily
knew
something
up
to
a
certain
point
they
amused
her
she
could
talk
of
ammonites
of
brachiopods
and
would
point
a
friend
attention
to
the
which
martin
prized
so
much
the
significance
of
palaeontology
she
dimly
apprehended
for
in
the
early
days
of
their
union
her
husband
had
felt
it
desirable
to
explain
to
her
what
was
meant
by
geologic
time
and
how
he
reconciled
his
views
on
that
subject
with
the
demands
of
religious
faith
among
the
books
which
he
induced
her
to
read
were
buckland
bridgewater
treatise
and
the
works
of
hugh
miller
the
intellectual
result
was
chaotic
and
warricombe
settled
at
last
into
a
comfortable
private
opinion
that
though
the
record
of
geology
might
be
trustworthy
that
of
the
bible
was
more
so
she
would
admit
that
there
was
no
impiety
in
accepting
the
evidence
of
nature
but
held
to
a
secret
conviction
that
it
was
safer
to
believe
in
genesis
for
anything
beyond
a
variance
from
biblical
authority
as
to
the
age
of
the
world
she
was
quite
unprepared
and
martin
in
his
discretion
imparted
to
her
nothing
of
the
graver
doubts
which
were
wont
to
trouble
him
but
as
her
children
grew
up
warricombe
mind
and
temper
were
insensibly
modified
by
influences
which
operated
through
her
maternal
affections
influences
no
doubt
aided
by
the
progressive
spirit
of
the
time
the
three
boys
buckland
maurice
and
louis
were
distinctly
of
a
new
generation
it
needed
some
ingenuity
to
discover
their
points
of
kindred
with
paternal
and
maternal
grandparents
nor
even
with
father
and
mother
had
they
much
in
common
which
observation
could
readily
detect
sidwell
up
to
at
least
her
fifteenth
year
seemed
to
present
far
less
change
of
type
in
her
warricombe
recognised
a
daughter
and
not
without
solace
but
fanny
again
was
a
problematical
nature
almost
from
the
cradle
latest
born
she
appeared
to
revive
many
characteristics
of
the
youthful
buckland
so
far
as
a
girl
could
resemble
her
brother
it
was
a
strange
brood
to
cluster
around
warricombe
for
many
years
the
mother
was
kept
in
alternation
between
hopes
and
fears
pride
and
disapproval
the
old
hereditary
habits
of
mind
and
a
new
order
of
ideas
which
could
only
be
admitted
with
the
utmost
slowness
buckland
radicalism
deeply
offended
her
she
marvelled
how
such
depravity
could
display
itself
in
a
child
of
hers
yet
in
the
end
her
ancestral
prejudices
so
far
yielded
as
to
allow
of
her
smiling
at
sentiments
which
she
once
heard
with
horror
maurice
whom
she
loved
more
tenderly
all
but
taught
her
to
see
the
cogency
of
a
syllogism
amiably
set
forth
and
louis
with
his
indolent
laughed
her
into
a
tolerance
of
many
things
which
had
moved
her
indignation
but
it
was
to
sidwell
that
in
the
end
she
owed
most
beneath
the
surface
of
ordinary
and
rather
backward
girlhood
which
discouraged
her
father
hopes
sidwell
was
quietly
developing
a
personality
distinguished
by
the
refinement
of
its
ethical
motives
her
orthodoxy
seemed
as
unimpeachable
as
mrs
warricombe
could
desire
yet
as
she
grew
into
womanhood
a
curiosity
which
in
no
way
disturbed
the
tenor
of
her
quietly
contented
life
led
her
to
examine
various
forms
of
religion
ancient
and
modern
and
even
systems
of
philosophy
which
professed
to
establish
a
moral
code
independent
of
supernatural
faith
she
was
not
of
studious
disposition
that
is
to
say
she
had
never
cared
as
a
schoolgirl
to
do
more
mental
work
than
was
required
of
her
and
even
now
it
was
seldom
that
she
read
for
more
than
an
hour
or
two
in
the
day
her
habit
was
to
dip
into
books
and
meditate
long
on
the
first
points
which
arrested
her
thoughts
of
continuous
application
she
seemed
incapable
she
could
read
french
but
did
not
attempt
to
pursue
the
other
languages
of
which
her
teachers
had
given
her
a
smattering
it
pleased
her
best
when
she
could
learn
from
conversation
in
this
way
she
obtained
some
insight
into
her
father
favourite
sciences
occasionally
making
suggestions
or
inquiries
which
revealed
a
subtle
if
not
an
acute
intelligence
little
by
little
warricombe
found
herself
changing
places
with
the
daughter
whom
she
had
regarded
as
wholly
subject
to
her
direction
sidwell
began
to
exercise
an
indeterminate
control
the
proofs
of
which
were
at
length
manifest
in
details
of
her
mother
speech
and
demeanour
an
exquisite
social
tact
an
unfailing
insensibly
as
the
qualities
of
pure
air
these
were
the
points
of
sincerity
of
moral
judgment
a
gentle
force
which
operated
as
character
to
which
warricombe
owed
the
humanisation
observable
when
one
compared
her
in
with
what
she
was
say
in
when
the
sight
of
professor
walsh
moved
her
to
acrimony
and
when
she
conceived
a
pique
against
professor
gale
because
the
letter
p
has
alphabetical
precedence
of
her
limitations
were
of
course
the
same
as
ever
and
from
her
sons
she
had
only
learnt
to
be
ashamed
of
announcing
them
too
vehemently
sidwell
it
was
who
had
led
her
to
that
degree
of
genuine
humility
which
is
not
satisfied
with
hiding
a
fault
but
strives
to
amend
it
martin
warricombe
himself
was
not
unaffected
by
the
growth
about
him
of
young
men
and
maidens
who
looked
upon
the
world
with
new
eyes
whose
world
indeed
was
another
than
that
in
which
he
had
spent
the
better
part
of
his
life
in
his
case
contact
with
the
young
generation
tended
to
unsettlement
to
a
troublesome
persistency
of
speculations
which
he
would
have
preferred
to
dismiss
altogether
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
for
some
years
after
he
was
content
to
make
a
broad
distinction
between
those
intellectual
pursuits
which
afforded
him
rather
a
liberal
amusement
than
the
pleasures
of
earnest
study
and
the
questions
of
metaphysical
faith
which
concerned
his
heart
and
conscience
his
native
prejudices
were
almost
as
strong
and
much
the
same
as
those
of
his
wife
but
with
the
vagueness
of
emotional
logic
natural
to
his
constitution
he
satisfied
himself
that
by
conceding
a
few
inessential
points
he
left
himself
at
liberty
to
follow
the
scientific
movements
of
the
day
without
damage
to
his
religious
convictions
the
tolerant
smile
so
frequently
on
his
countenance
was
directed
as
often
in
the
one
quarter
as
in
the
other
now
it
signified
a
gentle
reproof
of
those
men
of
science
who
like
professor
walsh
too
far
whose
zeal
for
knowledge
led
them
forget
the
source
of
all
true
enlightenment
now
it
expressed
a
forbearing
sympathy
with
such
as
erred
in
the
opposite
direction
who
were
literal
in
their
interpretation
of
the
sacred
volume
amiable
as
the
smile
was
it
betrayed
weakness
and
at
moments
martin
became
unpleasantly
conscious
of
indisposition
to
examine
his
own
mind
on
certain
points
his
life
indeed
was
one
of
debate
postponed
as
the
realm
of
science
extended
as
his
intercourse
with
men
who
frankly
avowed
their
grew
more
frequent
he
ever
and
again
said
to
himself
that
one
of
these
days
he
must
sit
down
and
it
out
in
a
solemn
but
for
the
most
part
he
got
on
very
well
amid
his
inconsistencies
religious
faith
has
rarely
any
connection
with
reasoning
martin
believed
because
he
believed
and
avoided
the
impact
of
disagreeable
arguments
because
he
wished
to
do
so
the
bent
of
his
mind
was
anything
but
polemical
he
cared
not
to
spend
time
even
over
those
authors
whose
attacks
on
the
outposts
of
science
or
whose
elaborate
reconcilements
of
old
and
new
might
have
afforded
him
some
support
on
the
other
hand
he
altogether
lacked
that
breadth
of
intellect
which
seeks
to
comprehend
all
the
results
of
speculation
to
discern
their
tendency
to
derive
from
them
a
consistent
theory
of
the
nature
of
things
though
a
man
be
well
versed
in
a
science
such
as
palaeontology
it
does
not
follow
that
he
will
view
it
in
its
philosophical
relations
martin
had
kept
himself
informed
of
all
the
facts
appertaining
to
his
study
which
the
age
brought
forth
but
without
developing
the
new
modes
of
mental
life
requisite
for
the
recognition
of
all
that
such
facts
involved
the
theories
of
evolution
he
did
not
venture
openly
to
resist
but
his
acceptance
of
them
was
so
that
practically
he
made
no
use
of
their
teaching
he
was
no
man
of
science
but
an
idler
among
the
wonders
which
science
uses
for
her
own
purposes
he
regarded
with
surprise
and
anxiety
the
tendencies
early
manifested
in
his
son
buckland
could
he
have
had
his
way
the
lad
would
have
grown
up
with
an
impossible
combination
of
qualities
blending
the
enthusiasm
of
modern
research
with
a
spirit
of
expansive
teleology
whilst
buckland
was
still
of
boyish
years
the
father
treated
with
bantering
such
outbreaks
of
irreverence
as
came
immediately
under
his
notice
weakly
abstaining
from
any
attempt
at
direct
argument
or
influence
but
at
a
later
time
there
took
place
serious
and
painful
discussions
and
only
when
the
young
man
had
rubbed
off
his
edges
in
the
world
highways
could
martin
forget
that
stage
of
most
unwelcome
conflict
at
the
death
of
his
younger
boy
maurice
he
suffered
a
blow
which
had
results
more
abiding
than
the
melancholy
wherewith
for
a
year
or
two
his
genial
nature
was
overshadowed
from
that
day
onwards
he
was
never
wholly
at
ease
among
the
pursuits
which
had
been
wont
to
afford
him
an
unfailing
resource
against
whatever
troubles
he
could
no
longer
accept
and
disregard
in
a
spirit
of
cheerful
faith
those
difficulties
science
was
perpetually
throwing
in
his
way
the
old
smile
of
kindly
tolerance
had
still
its
twofold
meaning
but
it
was
more
evidently
a
disguise
of
indecision
and
not
seldom
touched
with
sadness
life
was
still
one
of
postponed
debate
but
he
could
not
regard
the
day
when
conclusions
would
be
demanded
of
him
as
indefinitely
remote
desiring
to
dwell
in
the
familiar
temporary
abode
his
structure
of
incongruities
and
facile
reconcilements
he
found
it
no
longer
the
times
were
shaking
his
position
with
earthquake
after
earthquake
his
sons
for
he
suspected
that
louis
was
hardly
less
emancipated
than
buckland
stood
far
aloof
from
him
and
must
in
private
feel
contemptuous
of
his
beliefs
in
sidwell
however
he
had
a
companion
more
and
more
indispensable
and
he
could
not
imagine
that
faith
would
ever
give
way
before
the
invading
spirit
of
agnosticism
happily
she
was
no
mere
pietist
though
he
did
not
quite
understand
her
attitude
towards
christianity
he
felt
assured
that
sidwell
had
thought
deeply
and
earnestly
of
religion
in
all
its
aspects
and
it
was
a
solace
to
know
that
she
found
no
difficulty
in
recognising
the
large
claims
of
science
for
all
this
he
could
not
deliberately
seek
her
confidence
or
invite
her
to
a
discussion
of
religious
subjects
some
day
no
doubt
a
talk
of
that
kind
would
begin
naturally
between
them
and
so
strong
was
his
instinctive
faith
in
sidwell
that
he
looked
forward
to
this
future
communing
as
to
a
certain
hope
of
peace
that
a
figure
such
as
godwin
peak
a
young
man
of
vigorous
intellect
preparing
to
devote
his
life
to
the
old
religion
should
excite
warricombe
interest
was
of
course
to
be
anticipated
and
it
seemed
probable
enough
that
peak
exerting
all
the
force
of
his
character
and
aided
by
circumstances
might
before
long
convert
this
advantage
to
a
means
of
ascendency
over
the
less
nature
but
here
was
no
instance
of
a
dotard
becoming
the
easy
prey
of
a
scientific
tartufe
martin
intellect
had
suffered
no
decay
his
hale
features
and
dignified
bearing
expressed
the
mind
which
was
ripened
by
sixty
years
of
pleasurable
activity
and
which
was
learning
to
regard
with
steadier
view
the
problems
it
had
hitherto
shirked
he
could
not
change
the
direction
nature
had
given
to
his
thoughts
and
prepossession
would
in
some
degree
obscure
his
judgment
where
the
merits
and
trustworthiness
of
a
man
in
peak
circumstances
called
for
scrutiny
but
guarded
him
against
vulgar
artifices
and
a
fine
sensibility
made
it
improbable
that
he
would
become
the
victim
of
any
man
in
whom
base
motives
predominated
left
to
his
own
impulses
he
would
still
have
proceeded
with
all
caution
in
his
offers
of
friendly
services
to
peak
a
letter
of
admonition
which
he
received
from
his
son
apprising
him
of
peak
resolve
to
transfer
himself
to
exeter
scarcely
affected
his
behaviour
when
the
young
man
appeared
it
was
but
natural
he
argued
that
buckland
should
look
askance
on
a
case
of
for
his
own
part
he
understood
that
such
a
step
might
be
prompted
by
interest
but
he
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
to
a
man
in
position
the
church
would
offer
temptation
thus
coercive
nor
could
he
discern
in
the
candidate
for
a
curacy
any
mark
of
dishonourable
purpose
faults
no
doubt
were
observable
among
them
a
tendency
to
spiritual
pride
which
seemed
martin
could
admit
an
argument
for
rather
than
against
his
sincerity
the
progress
of
acquaintance
decidedly
confirmed
his
favourable
impressions
they
were
supported
by
the
remarks
of
those
among
his
friends
to
whom
peak
presently
became
known
it
was
not
until
whitsuntide
of
the
next
year
when
the
student
had
been
living
nearly
five
months
at
exeter
that
buckland
again
came
down
to
visit
his
relatives
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
chancing
to
be
alone
with
sidwell
he
asked
her
if
peak
had
been
to
the
house
lately
many
days
ago
replied
his
sister
lunched
with
us
and
then
sat
with
father
for
some
time
he
come
often
very
often
he
is
translating
a
german
book
which
interests
father
very
much
what
book
do
know
father
has
only
mentioned
it
in
that
way
they
were
in
a
little
room
sacred
to
the
two
girls
very
daintily
furnished
and
fragrant
of
which
sidwell
loved
so
much
that
when
the
season
allowed
it
she
often
wore
a
little
spray
of
it
at
her
girdle
buckland
opened
a
book
on
the
table
and
on
seeing
the
title
exclaimed
with
a
disparaging
laugh
ca
get
out
of
the
way
of
this
fellow
wherever
i
go
there
he
lies
about
on
the
tables
and
chairs
i
should
have
thought
he
was
thoroughly
smashed
by
an
article
that
came
out
in
last
year
sidwell
smiled
evidently
in
no
way
offended
article
could
smash
nobody
she
made
answer
was
too
violent
it
overshot
the
mark
a
bit
of
it
so
you
read
it
eh
you
beginning
to
read
are
you
my
humble
way
buckland
among
other
things
humble
enough
that
i
admit
am
not
a
great
admirer
of
returned
his
sister
with
a
look
of
amusement
i
congratulate
i
wonder
what
peak
thinks
of
the
book
really
do
know
let
me
ask
another
question
what
do
you
think
of
peak
sidwell
regarded
him
with
quiet
reflectiveness
feel
she
said
i
do
know
him
very
well
yet
he
is
certainly
interesting
he
is
does
he
impress
you
as
the
kind
of
man
likely
to
make
a
good
clergyman
do
see
any
reason
why
he
should
not
her
brother
mused
with
wrinkles
of
dissatisfaction
on
his
brow
gets
to
like
him
you
say
i
think
father
likes
him
i
suppose
it
all
right
right
the
most
astounding
thing
that
ever
came
under
my
observation
exclaimed
buckland
walking
away
and
then
returning
mr
peak
should
be
studying
for
the
church
do
reflect
more
modestly
urged
sidwell
with
something
that
was
not
quite
archness
though
as
near
it
as
her
habits
of
tone
and
feature
would
allow
should
you
refuse
to
admit
an
error
in
your
own
way
of
looking
at
things
would
it
be
better
to
take
this
as
a
proof
that
intellect
is
necessarily
at
war
with
christianity
never
stated
it
so
broadly
as
that
returned
her
brother
with
impatience
i
should
certainly
have
maintained
that
intellect
was
necessarily
in
that
position
you
see
how
wrong
you
would
have
been
remarked
the
girl
softly
i
do
know
do
know
mean
that
i
ca
acknowledge
what
i
ca
understand
do
try
to
understand
buckland
have
you
ever
put
aside
your
prejudice
for
a
moment
to
inquire
what
our
religion
really
means
not
once
i
think
at
all
events
not
since
you
reached
years
of
discretion
me
to
inform
you
that
i
studied
the
question
thoroughly
at
cambridge
yes
but
that
was
in
your
boyhood
when
does
manhood
begin
different
times
in
different
persons
in
your
case
it
was
late
buckland
laughed
he
was
considering
a
rejoinder
when
they
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
fanny
who
asked
at
once
you
go
to
see
mr
peak
this
evening
buckland
in
no
hurry
was
the
abrupt
reply
the
girl
hesitated
us
all
have
a
drive
together
with
mr
peak
i
mean
like
when
you
were
here
last
see
about
it
buckland
went
slowly
from
the
room
late
the
same
evening
he
sat
with
his
father
in
the
study
mr
warricombe
knew
not
the
solace
of
tobacco
and
his
son
though
never
quite
at
ease
without
pipe
or
cigar
denied
himself
in
this
room
with
the
result
that
he
shifted
frequently
upon
his
chair
and
fell
into
many
awkward
postures
how
does
peak
impress
you
he
inquired
when
the
subject
he
most
wished
to
converse
upon
had
been
postponed
to
many
others
it
was
clear
that
martin
would
not
himself
broach
it
disagreeably
was
the
reply
with
a
look
of
frankness
perhaps
is
he
doing
i
have
only
heard
from
him
once
since
he
came
down
and
he
had
very
little
to
say
about
himself
understand
that
he
proposes
to
take
the
london
then
he
never
did
that
has
he
unbosomed
himself
to
you
about
his
affairs
of
old
time
such
confidences
are
hardly
called
for
plainly
father
you
do
feel
any
uneasiness
martin
deliberated
fingering
the
while
an
engraved
stone
which
hung
upon
his
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
in
this
conversation
aware
that
buckland
regarded
the
circumstances
of
peak
sojourn
in
the
neighbourhood
with
feelings
allied
to
contempt
he
could
neither
adopt
the
tone
of
easy
confidence
natural
to
him
on
other
occasions
of
difference
in
opinion
nor
express
himself
with
the
coldness
which
would
have
obliged
his
son
to
quit
the
subject
you
had
better
tell
me
he
replied
are
really
uneasy
it
was
impossible
for
buckland
to
answer
as
his
mind
prompted
he
could
not
without
offence
declare
that
no
young
man
of
brains
now
adopted
a
clerical
career
with
pure
intentions
yet
such
was
his
sincere
belief
made
tolerant
in
many
directions
by
the
cultivation
of
his
shrewdness
he
was
hopelessly
biassed
in
judgment
as
soon
as
his
prejudice
came
into
play
a
point
of
strong
resemblance
between
him
and
peak
after
fidgeting
for
a
moment
he
exclaimed
i
am
but
i
ca
be
sure
that
there
any
cause
for
it
us
come
to
matters
of
fact
said
warricombe
showing
that
he
was
not
sorry
to
discuss
this
side
of
the
affair
suppose
there
is
no
doubt
that
peak
had
a
position
till
lately
at
the
place
he
speaks
of
doubt
whatever
i
have
taken
pains
to
ascertain
that
his
account
of
himself
so
far
is
strictly
true
martin
smiled
with
satisfaction
he
did
not
care
to
disguise
you
met
some
acquaintance
of
his
answered
buckland
changing
his
position
went
to
work
in
rather
an
underhand
way
perhaps
but
the
results
are
satisfactory
no
i
have
come
across
any
of
his
friends
but
i
happened
to
hear
not
long
ago
that
he
was
on
intimate
terms
with
some
journalists
his
father
laughed
compromising
in
that
association
buckland
do
say
that
though
the
fellows
i
speak
of
are
hot
radicals
mean
replied
the
young
man
with
his
shrewder
smile
they
are
not
exactly
the
companions
a
theological
student
would
select
understand
possibly
he
has
journalised
a
little
himself
i
ca
say
though
i
should
have
thought
it
likely
enough
i
might
of
course
find
out
much
more
about
him
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
have
assurance
of
his
truthfulness
in
that
one
respect
was
enough
for
the
present
you
mean
buckland
asked
his
father
gravely
you
have
been
setting
secret
police
at
work
yes
i
thought
it
the
least
objectionable
way
of
getting
information
martin
compressed
his
lips
and
looked
disapproval
really
ca
see
that
such
extreme
measures
were
demanded
come
come
what
is
all
this
about
do
you
suspect
him
of
planning
burglaries
that
was
an
step
buckland
decidedly
i
said
just
now
that
peak
impressed
me
by
no
means
disagreeably
now
i
will
add
that
i
am
convinced
of
his
good
faith
as
sure
of
it
as
i
am
of
his
remarkable
talents
and
aptitude
for
the
profession
he
aims
at
in
spite
of
your
extraordinary
distrust
i
feel
a
moment
doubt
of
his
honour
why
i
could
have
told
you
myself
that
he
has
known
radical
journalists
he
mentioned
it
the
other
day
and
explained
how
far
his
sympathy
went
with
that
kind
of
thing
no
no
that
was
hardly
permissible
buckland
the
young
man
had
no
difficulty
in
bowing
to
his
father
reproof
when
the
point
at
issue
was
one
of
gentlemanly
behaviour
admit
it
he
replied
wish
i
had
gone
to
rotherhithe
and
made
simple
inquiries
in
my
own
name
that
all
things
considered
i
might
have
allowed
myself
at
all
events
i
should
have
been
at
ease
without
getting
that
assurance
if
peak
had
heard
and
had
said
to
me
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
i
should
have
told
him
plainly
what
i
have
strongly
hinted
to
him
already
that
i
do
understand
what
he
is
doing
in
this
galley
have
placed
yourself
in
a
position
not
easy
to
define
doubt
this
arises
my
boy
resumed
martin
in
a
tone
of
grave
kindness
your
strange
inability
to
grant
that
on
certain
matters
you
may
be
wholly
misled
does
well
that
is
forbidden
ground
but
do
try
to
be
less
narrow
are
you
unable
then
to
meet
peak
in
a
friendly
way
by
no
means
it
seems
more
than
likely
that
i
have
wronged
him
said
keep
your
mind
open
i
marvel
at
the
dogmatism
of
men
who
are
set
on
overthrowing
dogma
such
a
position
is
so
strangely
unphilosophic
that
i
do
know
how
a
fellow
of
your
brains
can
hold
it
for
a
moment
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
angering
you
martin
added
in
his
pleasantest
tone
would
quote
the
master
of
trinity
capital
epigram
but
it
is
repeated
too
often
warricombe
shook
his
head
and
with
a
laugh
rose
to
say
a
great
pity
he
remarked
next
day
to
sidwell
who
had
been
saying
that
her
brother
seemed
less
vivacious
than
usual
buckland
is
defective
on
the
side
of
humour
for
a
man
who
claims
to
be
philosophical
he
takes
things
with
a
rather
obtuse
seriousness
i
know
nothing
better
than
humour
as
a
protection
against
the
kind
of
mistake
he
is
always
committing
the
application
of
this
was
not
clear
to
sidwell
something
happened
to
depress
him
she
asked
that
i
know
of
i
spoke
only
of
his
general
tendency
to
intemperate
zeal
that
is
enough
to
account
for
intervals
of
reaction
and
how
much
sounder
his
judgment
of
men
would
be
if
he
could
only
see
through
a
medium
of
humour
now
and
then
you
know
he
is
going
over
to
budleigh
salterton
this
afternoon
sidwell
smiled
and
said
quietly
thought
it
likely
he
would
at
budleigh
salterton
a
nook
on
the
coast
some
fifteen
miles
away
sylvia
moorhouse
was
now
dwelling
her
mother
a
widow
of
substantial
means
had
recently
established
herself
there
in
the
proximity
of
friends
and
the
mathematical
brother
made
his
home
with
them
that
buckland
took
every
opportunity
of
enjoying
sylvia
conversation
was
no
secret
whether
the
predilection
was
mutual
none
of
his
relatives
could
say
for
in
a
matter
such
as
this
buckland
was
by
nature
disposed
to
reticence
sidwell
intimacy
with
miss
moorhouse
put
her
in
no
better
position
than
the
others
for
forming
an
opinion
she
could
only
suspect
that
the
irony
which
flavoured
sylvia
talk
with
and
concerning
the
radical
intimated
a
lurking
kindness
preference
was
easily
understood
and
its
growth
for
five
or
six
years
seemed
to
promise
stability
immediately
after
luncheon
the
young
man
set
forth
and
did
not
reappear
until
the
evening
of
the
next
day
his
spirits
had
not
benefited
by
the
excursion
at
dinner
he
was
noticeably
silent
and
instead
of
going
to
the
afterwards
he
betook
himself
to
the
studio
up
on
the
roof
and
smoked
in
solitude
there
towards
ten
sidwell
sought
him
heavy
rain
was
beating
upon
the
glass
and
a
high
wind
blended
its
bluster
with
the
cheerless
sound
you
find
it
rather
cold
here
she
asked
after
observing
her
brother
countenance
of
gloom
i
coming
why
do
you
keep
up
your
painting
have
lost
interest
in
it
i
afraid
very
weak
you
know
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
interests
you
permanently
sidwell
thought
it
better
to
make
no
reply
characteristic
of
women
buckland
pursued
with
some
asperity
throwing
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
comes
i
suppose
of
their
ridiculous
education
their
minds
are
never
trained
to
fixity
of
purpose
they
never
understand
themselves
and
scarcely
ever
make
an
effort
to
understand
any
one
else
their
life
is
a
succession
of
inconsistencies
generalising
is
so
easy
said
sidwell
with
a
laugh
so
worthless
i
wonder
you
should
be
so
far
behind
the
times
light
have
the
times
thrown
on
the
subject
no
longer
such
a
thing
as
in
the
abstract
we
are
individuals
imagine
it
that
may
come
to
pass
three
or
four
generations
hence
but
as
yet
the
best
of
you
can
only
vary
the
type
in
unimportant
particulars
by
the
way
what
is
peak
address
street
but
i
do
know
the
number
father
can
give
it
you
i
think
shall
have
to
drop
him
a
note
i
must
get
back
to
town
early
in
the
morning
we
hoped
to
have
you
for
a
week
next
time
they
descended
together
now
that
louis
no
longer
abode
here
he
had
decided
at
length
for
medicine
and
was
at
work
in
london
the
family
as
a
rule
spent
very
quiet
evenings
by
ten
mrs
warricombe
and
fanny
had
retired
and
sidwell
was
left
either
to
talk
with
her
father
or
to
pursue
the
calm
meditations
which
seemed
to
make
her
independent
of
companionship
as
often
as
she
chose
they
all
gone
buckland
asked
finding
a
vacant
room
is
no
doubt
in
the
study
occurs
to
me
do
you
feel
satisfied
with
this
existence
no
life
could
suit
me
better
really
think
of
living
here
indefinitely
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
hope
nothing
may
ever
disturb
us
to
the
end
of
your
life
you
will
scent
yourself
with
sweetbrier
do
try
a
bit
of
mint
for
a
change
if
it
will
please
you
i
think
you
might
all
come
to
town
for
next
winter
you
are
rusting
all
of
you
father
was
never
so
dull
and
mother
does
seem
to
know
how
to
pass
the
days
it
would
be
bad
for
louis
to
be
living
with
you
instead
of
in
lodgings
do
just
think
of
it
it
ages
since
you
heard
a
concert
or
saw
a
picture
sidwell
mused
and
her
brother
watched
her
askance
do
know
whether
the
others
would
care
for
it
she
said
i
am
not
tempted
by
a
winter
of
fog
pooh
well
there
is
an
occasional
fog
just
now
and
then
but
it
much
exaggerated
who
ever
thinks
of
the
weather
in
england
fanny
might
have
a
time
at
bedford
college
or
some
such
learns
nothing
here
think
it
over
father
would
be
delighted
to
get
among
the
societies
and
so
on
he
repeated
his
arguments
in
many
forms
and
sidwell
listened
patiently
until
they
were
joined
by
warricombe
whereupon
the
subject
dropped
to
be
resumed
however
in
correspondence
with
a
persistency
which
buckland
seldom
exhibited
in
anything
which
affected
the
interests
of
his
relatives
as
the
summer
drew
on
mrs
warricombe
began
to
lend
serious
ear
to
this
suggestion
of
change
and
martin
was
at
all
events
moved
to
discuss
the
pros
and
cons
of
half
a
year
in
london
sidwell
preserved
neutrality
seldom
making
an
allusion
to
the
project
but
fanny
supported
her
brother
proposal
with
sprightly
zeal
declaring
on
one
occasion
that
she
began
distinctly
to
feel
the
need
of
higher
culture
such
as
london
only
could
supply
in
the
meantime
there
had
been
occasional
interchange
of
visits
between
the
family
and
their
friends
at
budleigh
salterton
one
evening
when
moorhouse
and
sylvia
were
at
the
warricombes
three
or
four
exeter
people
came
to
dine
and
among
the
guests
was
godwin
peak
his
invitation
being
due
in
this
instance
to
sylvia
express
wish
to
meet
him
again
am
studying
men
she
had
said
to
sidwell
not
long
before
when
the
latter
was
at
the
seaside
with
her
our
day
this
is
the
proper
study
of
womankind
hitherto
we
have
given
serious
attention
only
to
one
another
mr
peak
remains
in
my
memory
as
a
type
worth
observing
let
me
have
a
chance
of
talking
to
him
when
i
come
next
she
did
not
neglect
her
opportunity
and
moorhouse
who
also
conversed
with
the
theologian
and
found
him
interesting
was
so
good
as
to
hope
that
he
would
call
upon
her
if
ever
his
steps
turned
towards
budleigh
salterton
after
breakfast
next
morning
sidwell
found
her
friend
sitting
with
a
book
beneath
one
of
the
great
trees
of
the
garden
at
that
moment
sylvia
was
overcome
with
laughter
evidently
occasioned
by
her
reading
she
exclaimed
this
man
is
a
great
humorist
i
do
think
i
ever
read
anything
more
irresistible
the
book
was
hugh
miller
of
the
a
richly
bound
copy
belonging
to
warricombe
daresay
you
know
it
very
well
it
the
chapter
in
which
he
discusses
with
perfect
gravity
whether
it
would
have
been
possible
for
noah
to
collect
examples
of
all
living
creatures
in
the
ark
he
decides
that
it
would
that
the
deluge
have
spared
a
portion
of
the
earth
but
the
details
of
his
argument
are
delicious
especially
this
place
where
he
says
that
all
the
insects
could
have
been
brought
together
only
at
enormous
expense
of
miracle
i
suspected
a
secret
smile
but
no
that
out
of
the
question
at
enormous
expense
of
miracle
sylvia
eyes
winked
as
she
laughed
a
peculiarity
which
enhanced
the
charm
of
her
frank
mirth
her
dark
pure
complexion
eyebrows
subtle
lips
were
shadowed
beneath
a
great
garden
hat
and
a
loose
white
gown
with
no
oppressive
moulding
at
the
waist
made
her
a
refreshing
picture
in
the
glare
of
phrase
is
ridiculous
enough
assented
sidwell
can
be
but
miracle
however
great
or
small
its
extent
it
strange
reading
a
book
of
this
kind
nowadays
what
a
leap
we
have
made
i
should
think
there
hardly
a
country
curate
who
would
be
capable
of
bringing
this
argument
into
a
sermon
do
know
returned
sidwell
smiling
still
hears
remarkable
sermons
will
mr
peak
be
like
they
exchanged
glances
sylvia
wore
a
look
of
reflective
curiosity
and
her
friend
answered
with
some
hesitation
as
if
the
thought
were
new
to
her
wo
deal
with
noah
we
may
take
that
for
granted
likely
not
with
miracles
however
little
expensive
not
i
suppose
he
will
deal
chiefly
with
the
moral
teaching
of
christianity
you
think
him
strong
as
a
moralist
inquired
sylvia
has
very
decided
opinions
about
the
present
state
of
our
civilisation
i
find
but
is
there
any
distinctly
moral
force
in
him
thinks
so
sidwell
replied
so
do
our
friends
the
lilywhites
miss
moorhouse
pondered
awhile
is
a
great
problem
to
me
she
declared
at
length
knitting
her
brows
with
a
hint
of
humorous
exaggeration
wonder
whether
he
believes
in
the
dogmas
of
christianity
sidwell
was
startled
he
think
of
becoming
a
clergyman
why
not
do
they
recognise
nowadays
that
the
spirit
is
enough
there
was
silence
sidwell
let
her
eyes
wander
over
the
sunny
grass
to
the
creeper
on
the
nearest
side
of
the
house
would
involve
a
great
deal
of
dissimulation
she
said
at
length
ca
reconcile
it
with
what
i
know
of
mr
peak
i
ca
reconcile
anything
else
rejoined
the
other
impresses
you
as
a
rationalist
not
confess
i
have
taken
his
belief
for
granted
oh
think
he
keep
up
such
a
pretence
however
you
justify
it
it
implies
conscious
deception
it
would
be
dishonourable
i
am
sure
would
think
it
so
does
your
brother
regard
him
sylvia
asked
smiling
very
slightly
but
with
direct
eyes
ca
credit
anyone
with
sincerity
except
an
aggressive
agnostic
i
think
he
allows
honest
credulity
sidwell
had
no
answer
to
this
after
musing
a
little
she
put
a
question
which
indicated
how
her
thoughts
had
travelled
you
met
many
women
who
declared
themselves
agnostics
sylvia
removed
her
hat
and
began
to
fan
herself
gently
with
the
brim
here
in
the
shade
bees
were
humming
from
the
house
came
faint
notes
of
a
piano
fanny
practising
a
mazurka
of
chopin
never
i
suppose
one
who
found
a
pleasure
in
attacking
christianity
girl
who
was
at
school
with
me
in
london
sylvia
replied
with
an
air
of
amused
reminiscence
moxey
did
i
ever
speak
to
you
of
her
think
not
was
bitter
against
religion
of
every
kind
her
mother
made
her
learn
collects
i
dare
say
suggested
sidwell
in
a
tone
of
gentle
satire
no
marcella
was
about
eighteen
then
and
had
neither
father
nor
how
fanny
touch
improves
she
was
a
born
atheist
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
detestable
to
me
i
rather
liked
her
she
was
remarkably
honest
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
in
morals
on
the
whole
she
stood
far
above
most
women
she
hated
falsehood
hated
it
with
all
her
heart
and
a
story
of
injustice
maddened
her
when
i
think
of
marcella
it
helps
me
to
picture
the
russian
girls
who
propagate
nihilism
have
lost
sight
of
her
went
abroad
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
known
her
fate
i
rather
think
there
will
have
to
be
many
like
her
before
women
are
civilised
i
should
like
to
ask
her
said
sidwell
what
she
supported
her
morality
the
problem
to
mr
peak
suggested
the
other
gaily
fancy
he
would
find
it
insoluble
warricombe
and
moorhouse
appeared
in
the
distance
walking
hither
under
parasols
the
girls
rose
to
meet
them
and
were
presently
engaged
in
less
interesting
colloquy
chapter
iv
this
summer
peak
became
a
of
london
university
to
avoid
the
risk
of
a
casual
meeting
with
acquaintances
he
did
not
go
to
london
but
sat
for
his
examination
at
the
nearest
provincial
centre
the
revival
of
boyish
tremors
at
the
successive
stages
of
this
business
was
anything
but
agreeable
it
reminded
him
with
humiliating
force
how
far
he
had
strayed
from
the
path
indicated
to
his
manhood
defeat
would
have
strengthened
in
overwhelming
revolt
all
the
impulses
which
from
time
to
time
urged
him
to
abandon
his
servile
course
but
there
was
no
chance
of
his
failing
to
satisfy
the
examiners
with
he
had
now
nothing
to
do
enough
for
his
purpose
that
in
another
year
time
he
would
write
himself
bachelor
of
arts
and
thus
simplify
the
clerical
preliminaries
in
what
quarter
he
was
to
look
for
a
curacy
remained
uncertain
meanwhile
his
enterprise
seemed
to
prosper
and
success
emboldened
his
hopes
hopes
which
were
no
longer
vague
but
had
defined
themselves
in
a
way
which
circumstances
made
inevitable
though
he
had
consistently
guarded
himself
against
the
obvious
suggestions
arising
out
of
his
intercourse
with
the
warricombe
family
though
he
still
emphasised
every
discouraging
fact
and
strove
to
regard
it
as
axiomatic
that
nothing
could
be
more
perilous
to
his
future
than
a
hint
of
presumption
or
in
word
or
deed
beneath
that
friendly
roof
it
was
coming
to
pass
that
he
thought
of
sidwell
not
only
as
the
type
of
woman
pursued
by
his
imagination
but
as
herself
the
object
of
his
converging
desires
comparison
of
her
with
others
had
no
result
but
the
deepening
of
that
impression
she
had
at
first
made
upon
him
sidwell
exhibited
all
the
qualities
which
most
appealed
to
him
in
her
class
in
addition
she
had
the
charms
of
a
personality
which
he
could
not
think
of
common
occurrence
he
was
yet
far
from
understanding
her
she
exercised
his
powers
of
observation
analysis
conjecture
as
no
other
person
had
ever
done
each
time
he
saw
her
were
it
but
for
a
moment
he
came
away
with
some
new
perception
of
her
excellence
some
hitherto
unmarked
grace
of
person
or
mind
whereon
to
meditate
he
had
never
approached
a
woman
who
possessed
this
power
at
once
of
fascinating
his
senses
and
controlling
his
intellect
to
a
glad
reverence
whether
in
her
presence
or
musing
upon
her
in
solitude
he
found
that
the
unsparing
naturalism
of
his
scrutiny
was
powerless
to
degrade
that
sweet
pure
being
rare
under
any
circumstances
is
the
passionate
love
which
controls
every
motive
of
heart
and
mind
rarer
still
that
form
of
it
which
with
no
assurance
of
reciprocation
devotes
exclusive
ardour
to
an
object
only
approachable
through
declared
obstacles
godwin
peak
was
not
framed
for
romantic
languishment
in
general
the
more
complex
a
mechanism
and
the
more
pronounced
his
habit
of
introspection
the
less
capable
is
he
of
loving
with
vehemence
and
constancy
heroes
of
passion
are
for
the
most
part
primitive
natures
nobly
tempered
in
our
time
they
tend
to
extinction
growing
vulgarism
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
a
development
of
the
psychological
conscience
are
unfavourable
to
any
relation
between
the
sexes
save
those
which
originate
in
pure
animalism
or
in
reasoning
less
or
more
generous
never
having
experienced
any
feeling
which
he
could
dignify
with
the
name
of
love
godwin
had
no
criterion
in
himself
whereby
to
test
the
emotions
now
besetting
him
in
a
man
of
his
age
this
was
an
unusual
state
of
things
for
when
the
ardour
which
will
bear
analysis
has
at
length
declared
itself
it
is
wont
to
be
moderated
by
the
regretful
memory
of
that
fugacious
essence
which
gave
to
the
first
frenzy
of
youth
its
irrecoverable
delight
he
could
not
say
in
reply
to
his
impulses
if
that
was
love
which
overmastered
me
this
must
be
something
either
more
or
less
exalted
what
he
say
was
something
of
this
kind
if
desire
and
tenderness
if
frequency
of
dreaming
rapture
if
the
calmest
approval
of
the
mind
and
the
heart
most
exquisite
most
painful
throbbing
constitute
love
then
assuredly
i
love
sidwell
but
if
to
love
is
to
be
possessed
with
madness
to
lose
all
taste
of
life
when
hope
refuses
itself
to
meditate
frantic
follies
to
deem
it
inconceivable
that
this
woman
should
ever
lose
her
dominion
over
me
or
another
reign
in
her
stead
then
my
passion
falls
short
of
the
true
testrum
and
i
am
only
dallying
with
fancies
which
might
spring
up
as
often
as
i
encountered
a
charming
girl
all
things
considered
to
encourage
this
amorous
preoccupation
was
probably
the
height
of
unwisdom
the
lover
is
ready
at
deluding
himself
but
peak
never
lost
sight
of
the
extreme
unlikelihood
that
he
should
ever
become
martin
warricombe
of
the
thousand
respects
which
forbade
his
hoping
that
sidwell
would
ever
lay
her
hand
in
his
that
sense
of
class
which
had
so
much
influence
on
his
speculative
and
practical
life
asserted
itself
with
rigid
consistency
even
against
his
own
aspirations
he
attributed
to
the
warricombes
more
prejudice
on
this
subject
than
really
existed
in
them
he
it
was
true
belonged
to
no
class
whatever
acknowledged
no
subordination
save
that
of
the
hierarchy
of
intelligence
but
this
could
not
obscure
the
fact
that
his
brother
sold
seeds
across
a
counter
that
his
sister
had
married
a
haberdasher
that
his
uncle
notoriously
was
somewhere
or
other
supplying
the
public
with
cheap
repasts
girls
of
sidwell
delicacy
do
not
misally
themselves
for
they
take
into
account
the
fact
that
such
misalliance
is
fraught
with
elements
of
unhappiness
affecting
husband
as
much
as
wife
no
need
to
dwell
upon
the
scruples
suggested
by
his
moral
attitude
he
would
never
be
called
upon
to
combat
them
with
reference
to
sidwell
future
what
then
was
he
about
for
what
advantage
was
he
playing
the
hypocrite
would
he
after
all
be
satisfied
with
some
such
wife
as
the
average
curate
may
hope
to
marry
a
hundred
times
he
reviewed
the
broad
question
by
the
light
of
his
six
months
experience
was
sidwell
warricombe
his
ideal
woman
absolutely
speaking
why
no
not
with
all
his
glow
of
feeling
could
he
persuade
himself
to
declare
her
that
satisfied
up
to
a
certain
point
admitted
to
the
sphere
of
wealthy
refinement
he
now
had
leisure
to
think
of
yet
higher
grades
of
the
women
who
are
not
only
exquisite
creatures
by
social
comparison
but
rank
by
divine
right
among
the
foremost
of
their
race
sidwell
was
far
from
intolerant
and
held
her
faiths
in
a
sincerely
ethical
spirit
she
judged
nobly
she
often
saw
with
clear
vision
but
must
not
something
of
kindly
condescension
always
blend
with
his
admiring
devotedness
were
it
but
possible
to
win
the
love
of
a
woman
who
looked
forth
with
eyes
thoroughly
purged
from
all
mist
of
tradition
and
conventionalism
who
was
at
home
among
arts
and
sciences
who
like
himself
acknowledged
no
class
and
bowed
to
no
authority
but
that
of
the
supreme
human
mind
such
women
are
to
be
found
in
every
age
but
how
many
of
them
shine
with
the
distinctive
ray
of
womanhood
these
are
so
rare
that
they
have
a
place
in
the
pages
of
history
the
truly
emancipated
woman
it
was
godwin
conviction
is
almost
always
asexual
to
him
therefore
utterly
repugnant
if
then
he
were
not
content
to
waste
his
life
in
a
vain
search
for
the
priceless
jewel
which
is
won
and
worn
only
by
fortune
supreme
favourites
he
must
acquiesce
in
the
imperfect
marriage
commonly
the
lot
of
men
whose
intellect
allows
them
but
little
companionship
even
among
their
own
sex
for
that
matter
the
lot
of
most
men
and
necessarily
so
until
the
new
efforts
in
female
education
shall
have
overcome
the
vice
of
wedlock
as
hitherto
sanctioned
nature
provides
the
hallucination
which
flings
a
lover
at
his
mistress
feet
for
the
chill
which
follows
upon
attainment
she
cares
nothing
let
society
and
individuals
make
their
account
with
that
as
best
they
may
even
with
a
wife
such
as
sidwell
the
process
of
disillusion
would
doubtless
have
to
be
faced
however
liberal
one
allowances
in
the
forecast
reflections
of
this
colour
were
useful
they
helped
to
keep
within
limits
the
growth
of
agitating
desire
but
there
were
seasons
when
godwin
surrendered
himself
to
luxurious
reverie
hours
of
summer
twilight
which
forbade
analysis
and
listened
only
to
the
harmonies
of
passion
then
was
sidwell
image
glorified
and
all
the
delights
promised
by
such
love
as
hers
fired
his
imagination
to
intolerable
ecstasy
o
heaven
to
see
the
smile
softened
by
rosy
warmth
which
would
confess
that
she
had
given
her
heart
to
feel
her
supple
fingers
intertwined
with
his
that
clasped
them
to
hear
the
words
in
which
a
mind
so
admirable
instincts
so
delicate
would
make
expression
of
their
tenderness
to
live
with
sidwell
to
breathe
the
fragrance
of
that
flower
of
womanhood
in
wedded
intimacy
to
prove
the
devotion
of
a
nature
so
profoundly
chaste
the
visionary
transport
was
too
poignant
in
the
end
it
drove
him
to
a
fierce
outbreak
of
despairing
wrath
how
could
he
dream
that
such
bliss
would
be
the
reward
of
despicable
artifice
of
calculated
dishonour
born
a
rebel
how
could
his
be
the
fate
of
those
happy
men
who
are
at
one
with
the
order
of
things
the
prophecy
of
a
heart
wrung
with
anguish
foretold
too
surely
that
for
him
was
no
rapturous
love
no
joy
of
noble
wedlock
solitude
now
and
for
ever
or
perchance
some
base
alliance
of
the
flesh
which
would
involve
his
later
days
in
sordid
misery
in
moods
of
discouragement
he
thought
with
envy
of
his
old
self
his
life
in
london
lodgings
his
freedom
in
obscurity
it
belongs
to
the
pathos
of
human
nature
that
only
in
looking
back
can
one
appreciate
the
true
value
of
those
long
tracts
of
monotonous
ease
which
when
we
are
living
through
them
seem
of
no
account
save
in
relation
to
past
or
future
only
at
a
distance
do
we
perceive
that
the
exemption
from
painful
shock
was
in
itself
a
happiness
to
be
rated
highly
in
comparison
with
most
of
those
disturbances
known
as
moments
of
joy
a
wise
man
would
have
entertained
no
wish
but
that
he
might
grow
old
in
that
same
succession
of
days
and
weeks
and
years
without
anxiety
concerning
his
material
needs
certainly
the
most
substantial
of
earthly
blessings
his
leisure
not
inadequate
to
the
gratification
of
a
moderate
studiousness
with
friends
who
offered
him
an
welcome
was
it
not
much
if
he
were
condemned
to
bachelorhood
his
philosophy
was
surely
capable
of
teaching
him
that
the
sorrows
and
anxieties
he
thus
escaped
made
more
than
an
offset
against
the
satisfactions
he
must
forego
reason
had
no
part
in
the
fantastic
change
to
which
his
life
had
submitted
nor
was
he
ever
supported
by
a
hope
which
would
bear
his
cooler
investigation
and
yet
hope
had
her
periods
of
control
for
there
are
times
when
the
mind
wearies
of
rationality
and
as
it
were
in
in
obedience
to
the
instinct
of
progressive
life
craves
a
specious
comfort
it
seemed
undeniable
that
warricombe
regarded
him
with
growth
of
interest
invited
his
conversation
more
unreservedly
he
began
to
understand
martin
position
with
regard
to
religion
and
science
and
thus
could
utter
himself
more
securely
at
length
he
ventured
to
discourse
with
some
amplitude
on
his
own
convictions
the
views
that
is
to
say
which
he
thought
fit
to
adopt
in
his
character
of
a
liberal
christian
it
was
on
an
afternoon
of
early
august
that
this
opportunity
presented
itself
they
sat
together
in
the
study
and
martin
was
in
a
graver
mood
than
usual
not
much
disposed
to
talk
but
a
willing
listener
there
had
been
mention
of
a
sermon
at
the
cathedral
in
which
the
preacher
declared
his
faith
that
the
maturity
of
science
would
dispel
all
antagonisms
between
it
and
revelation
difficulties
of
the
unbeliever
said
peak
endeavouring
to
avoid
a
sermonising
formality
though
with
indifferent
success
of
course
of
two
kinds
there
the
theory
of
evolution
and
modern
biblical
criticism
the
more
i
study
these
objections
the
less
able
i
am
to
see
how
they
come
in
conflict
with
belief
in
christianity
as
a
revealed
religion
you
probably
had
your
time
of
doubt
remarked
the
other
touching
for
the
first
time
on
this
personal
matter
yes
that
was
inevitable
it
only
means
that
one
development
is
imperfect
most
men
who
confirm
themselves
in
agnosticism
are
kept
at
that
point
by
arrested
moral
activity
they
give
up
the
intellectual
question
as
wearisome
and
accept
the
point
of
view
which
flatters
their
prejudices
thereupon
follows
a
blunting
of
the
sensibilities
on
the
religious
side
are
men
constitutionally
unfitted
for
the
reception
of
spiritual
truth
said
martin
in
a
troubled
tone
he
was
playing
with
a
piece
of
string
and
did
not
raise
his
eyes
quite
believe
that
there
our
difficulty
when
we
come
to
evidences
the
evidences
of
science
are
wholly
different
in
from
those
of
religion
faith
can
not
spring
from
any
observation
of
phenomena
or
scrutiny
of
authorities
but
from
the
declaration
made
to
us
by
the
spiritual
faculty
the
man
of
science
can
only
become
a
christian
by
the
way
of
humility
and
that
a
kind
of
humility
he
finds
it
difficult
even
to
conceive
one
wishes
to
impress
upon
him
the
harmony
of
this
faith
with
the
spiritual
voice
that
is
in
every
man
he
replies
i
know
nothing
of
that
spiritual
voice
and
if
that
be
true
one
ca
help
him
by
argument
peak
had
constructed
for
himself
out
of
his
reading
a
plausible
system
which
on
demand
he
could
set
forth
with
fluency
the
tone
of
current
apologetics
taught
him
that
by
men
even
of
cultivated
intellect
such
a
position
as
he
was
now
sketching
was
deemed
tenable
yet
to
himself
it
sounded
so
futile
so
nugatory
that
he
had
to
harden
his
forehead
as
he
spoke
trial
more
severe
to
his
conscience
lay
in
the
perceptible
solicitude
with
which
mr
warricombe
weighed
these
disingenuous
arguments
it
was
a
hateful
thing
to
practise
such
deception
on
one
who
probably
yearned
for
spiritual
support
but
he
had
committed
himself
to
this
course
and
must
brave
it
out
he
was
saying
presently
appropriating
a
passage
of
which
he
had
once
made
careful
note
an
organism
of
such
vital
energy
that
it
perforce
assimilates
whatever
is
good
and
true
in
the
culture
of
each
successive
age
to
understand
this
is
to
learn
that
we
must
depend
rather
on
than
on
apology
that
is
to
say
we
must
draw
evidence
of
our
faith
from
its
latent
capacities
its
unsuspected
affinities
its
previsions
its
adaptability
comprehensiveness
sympathy
adequacy
to
human
needs
puts
very
well
what
i
have
always
felt
replied
mr
warricombe
there
will
remain
the
objection
that
such
a
faith
may
be
of
purely
human
origin
if
evolution
and
biblical
criticism
seem
to
overthrow
all
the
historic
evidences
of
christianity
how
convince
the
objectors
that
the
faith
itself
was
divinely
given
i
can
not
hold
for
a
moment
exclaimed
peak
in
the
words
which
he
knew
his
interlocutor
desired
to
hear
all
the
historic
evidences
have
been
destroyed
that
indeed
would
shake
our
position
he
enlarged
on
the
point
with
display
of
learning
yet
studiously
avoiding
the
tone
of
pedantry
he
remarked
when
the
dialogue
had
again
extended
its
scope
not
touch
the
evidence
of
design
in
the
universe
at
most
it
can
correct
our
imperfect
views
handed
down
from
an
age
which
had
no
scientific
teaching
because
it
was
not
ripe
for
it
of
the
mode
in
which
that
design
was
executed
or
rather
is
still
being
executed
evolutionists
have
not
succeeded
in
explaining
life
they
have
merely
discovered
a
new
law
relating
to
life
if
we
must
have
an
explanation
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
the
notion
of
a
deity
indeed
how
can
there
be
religion
without
a
divine
author
religion
is
based
on
the
idea
of
a
divine
mind
which
reveals
itself
to
us
for
moral
ends
the
christian
revelation
we
hold
has
been
developed
gradually
much
of
it
in
connection
with
secondary
causes
and
human
events
it
has
come
down
to
us
in
anything
but
absolute
purity
like
a
stream
which
has
been
made
turbid
by
its
earthly
channel
the
lower
serves
its
purpose
as
a
stage
to
the
higher
then
it
falls
away
the
higher
surviving
hitherto
the
final
outcome
of
evolution
is
the
soul
in
a
bodily
tenement
may
it
not
be
that
the
perfected
soul
alone
survives
in
the
last
step
of
the
struggle
for
existence
peak
had
been
talking
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
under
stress
of
shame
and
intellectual
for
he
could
not
help
confuting
every
position
as
he
stated
it
his
mind
often
wandered
when
he
ceased
speaking
there
came
upon
him
an
uncomfortable
dreaminess
which
he
had
already
once
or
twice
experienced
when
in
colloquy
with
warricombe
a
tormenting
metaphysical
doubt
of
his
own
identity
strangely
beset
him
with
involuntary
attempt
to
recover
the
familiar
self
he
grasped
his
own
wrist
and
then
before
he
was
aware
a
laugh
escaped
him
an
all
but
mocking
laugh
unsuitable
enough
to
the
spirit
of
the
moment
mr
warricombe
was
startled
but
looked
up
with
a
friendly
smile
fear
he
said
this
last
speculation
may
seem
rather
fanciful
to
me
godwin
was
biting
his
lip
fiercely
and
could
not
command
himself
to
utterance
of
a
word
no
means
i
assure
you
added
the
other
appeals
to
me
very
strongly
peak
rose
from
his
chair
struck
me
he
said
i
had
been
preaching
a
sermon
rather
than
taking
part
in
a
conversation
i
afraid
it
is
the
habit
of
men
who
live
a
good
deal
alone
to
indulge
in
monologues
on
his
return
home
the
sight
of
und
and
his
sheets
of
laborious
manuscript
filled
him
with
disgust
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
he
could
again
apply
himself
to
the
translation
yet
this
expedient
had
undoubtedly
been
of
great
service
to
him
in
the
matter
of
his
relations
with
warricombe
without
the
aid
of
reusch
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
speak
naturally
on
the
theme
which
drew
martin
into
confidences
and
established
an
intimacy
between
them
already
they
had
discussed
in
detail
the
first
half
of
the
book
how
a
man
of
warricombe
intelligence
could
take
grave
interest
in
an
arid
exegesis
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
godwin
strove
in
vain
to
comprehend
often
enough
the
debates
were
perilously
suggestive
of
burlesque
and
when
alone
he
relieved
himself
of
the
laughter
he
had
scarce
restrained
for
instance
there
was
that
terrible
of
the
second
verse
a
phrase
preserved
from
the
original
and
tossed
into
all
the
corners
of
controversy
was
the
first
condition
of
the
earth
or
was
it
merely
a
period
of
division
between
a
previous
state
of
things
and
creation
as
established
by
the
hexaemeron
did
light
exist
or
not
previous
to
the

what
kind

passed
before

of

special
interest
of
course
attached
to
the
successive
theories
of
theology
on
the
origin
of
geologic
strata
first
came
the
of
restitution
which
explained
unbiblical
antiquity
by
declaring
that
the
strata
belonged
to
a
world
before
the
hexaimeron
a
world
which
had
been
destroyed
and
succeeded
by
the
new
creation
less
objectionable
was
the
theory
which
interprets
the
days
as
so
many
vast
periods
of
creative
activity
but
reusch
himself
gave
preference
to
the
theory
the
supporters
whereof
diligently
adapting
themselves
to
the
progress
of
science
hold
that
the
six
days
are
not
to
be
understood
as
consecutive
periods
at
all
but
merely
as
six
phases
of
the
creator
work
by
the
exercise
of
watchfulness
and
dexterity
peak
managed
for
the
most
part
to
avoid
expression
of
definite
opinions
his
attitude
was
that
of
a
reverent
not
yet
reverend
student
warricombe
was
less
guarded
and
sometimes
allowed
himself
to
profess
that
he
saw
nothing
but
vain
ingenuity
in
reusch
argument
as
for
example
where
the
theologian
convinced
that
the
patriarchs
did
really
live
to
an
abnormal
age
suggests
that
man
life
was
subsequently
shortened
in
order
that
might
not
flourish
with
such
exuberance
this
passage
caused
martin
to
smile
wo
do
it
wo
do
he
said
quietly
better
apply
his
rationalism
here
as

these
are
wonderful
old
stories
not
to
be
understood
literally
nothing
depends
upon
them
nothing
essential
thereupon
peak
mused
anxiously
not
for
the
first
time
there
occurred
to
him
a
thought
which
suited
only
too
well
with
his
ironic
habits
of
mind
what
if
this
hypocritic
comedy
were
altogether
superfluous
what
if
warricombe
would
have
received
him
no
less
cordially
had
he
avowed
his
sincere
position
and
contented
himself
with
guarding
against
offensiveness
buckland
it
was
true
had
suffered
in
his
father
esteem
on
account
of
his
unorthodoxy
but
that
young
man
had
been
too
aggressive
too
scornful
with
prudence
would
it
not
have
been
possible
to
win
martin
regard
by
fortifying
the
scientific
rather
than
the
dogmatic
side
of
his
intellect
if
so
what
a
hopeless
error
had
he
committed
but
sidwell
was
liberal
enough
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
one
who
had
renounced
faith
in
revelation
he
could
not
decide
this
question
for
of
sidwell
he
knew
much
less
than
of
her
father
and
it
was
idle
to
torment
himself
with
such
debate
of
the
irreversible
and
indeed
there
seemed
much
reason
for
believing
that
martin
whatever
the
extent
of
his
secret
doubts
was
by
temperament
armed
against
agnosticism
distinctly
it
comforted
him
to
hear
the
unbelievers
assailed
the
friends
of
whom
he
spoke
most
heartily
were
all
on
the
orthodox
side
if
ever
a
hint
of
gentle
malice
occurred
in
his
conversation
it
was
when
he
spoke
of
a
fallacy
a
precipitate
conclusion
detected
in
works
of
science
probably
he
was
too
old
to
overcome
this
bias
his
view
of
the
bible
appeared
to
harmonise
with
that
which
peak
put
forth
in
one
of
their
dialogues
scriptures
were
meant
to
be
literally
understood
in
primitive
ages
and
spiritually
when
the
growth
of
science
made
it
possible
was
never
intended
to
teach
the
facts
of
natural
history
it
takes
phenomena
as
they
appear
to
uninstructed
people
and
uses
them
only
for
the
inculcation
of
moral
lessons
it
presents
to
the
childhood
of
the
world
a
few
great
elementary
truths
and
the
way
in
which
phenomena
are
spoken
of
in
the
old
testament
is
never
really
incompatible
with
the
facts
as
we
know
them
nowadays
take
the
miracle
of
the
sun
standing
still
which
is
supposed
to
be
a
safe
subject
of
ridicule
why
it
merely
means
that
light
was
miraculously
prolonged
the
words
used
are
those
which
common
people
would
at
all
times
understand
was
it
necessary
to
have
admitted
the
miracle
godwin
asked
himself
at
all
events
warricombe
nodded
approvingly
the
narrative
of
the
creation
of
man
that
not
at
all
incompatible
with
his
slow
development
through
ages
to
teach
the
scientific
fact
if
we
yet
really
know
it
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
the
story
is
meant
to
express
that
spirit
and
not
matter
is
the
source
of
all
existence
indeed
our
knowledge
of
the
true
meaning
of
the
bible
has
increased
with
the
growth
of
science
and
naturally
that
must
have
been
intended
from
the
first
things
which
do
not
concern
man
relation
to
the
spiritual
have
no
place
in
this
book
they
are
not
within
its
province
such
things
were
discoverable
by
human
reason
and
the
knowledge
which
achieves
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
divine
revelation
to
godwin
it
was
a
grinding
of
the
air
but
the
listener
appeared
to
think
it
profitable
with
his
clerical
friend
lilywhite
he
rarely
touched
on
matters
of
religion
the
vicar
of
ethelreda
was
a
man
well
suited
to
support
the
social
dignity
of
his
church
a
gentleman
before
everything
he
seemed
incapable
of
prying
into
the
state
of
a
parishioner
soul
you
saw
in
him
the
official
representative
of
a
divinity
characterised
by
tolerance
he
had
written
a
pleasant
little
book
on
the
of
devon
and
cornwall
which
brought
about
his
intimacy
with
the
warricombe
household
peak
liked
him
more
the
better
he
knew
him
and
in
the
course
of
the
summer
they
had
one
or
two
long
walks
together
conversing
exclusively
of
the
things
of
earth
lilywhite
troubled
himself
little
about
evolution
he
spoke
of
trees
and
plants
of
birds
and
animals
in
a
loving
spirit
like
the
old
simple
naturalists
geology
did
not
come
within
his
sphere
very
sorry
he
said
i
could
never
care
much
for
it
think
i
afraid
of
it
not
i
i
feel
the
grandeur
of
its
scope
just
as
i
do
in
the
case
of
astronomy
but
i
have
never
brought
myself
to
study
either
science
a
narrowness
of
mind
no
doubt
i
ca
go
into
such
remote
times
and
regions
i
love
the
sunlight
and
the
green
fields
of
this
little
corner
of
the
world
too
well
perhaps
yes
perhaps
too
well
after
one
of
these
walks
he
remarked
to
lilywhite
my
impression
that
mr
peak
has
somehow
been
misled
in
his
choice
of
a
vocation
i
do
think
he
do
as
a
churchman
not
henry
asked
his
wife
with
gentle
concern
for
she
still
spoke
of
peak
moral
force
something
too
restless
about
him
i
doubt
whether
he
has
really
made
up
his
mind
on
any
subject
whatever
well
it
not
easy
to
explain
what
i
feel
but
i
do
think
he
will
take
orders
calling
at
the
vicarage
one
afternoon
in
september
godwin
found
mrs
lilywhite
alone
she
startled
him
by
saying
at
once
old
acquaintance
of
yours
was
with
us
yesterday
mr
peak
could
that
be
i
wonder
he
smiled
softly
controlling
his
impulse
to
show
quite
another
expression
remember
bruno
chilvers
yes
there
was
a
constriction
in
his
throat
struggling
to
overcome
it
he
added
i
should
have
thought
he
had
no
recollection
of
me
the
contrary
i
assure
you
he
is
to
succeed
bell
of
st
margaret
at
christmas
he
was
down
here
only
for
a
day
or
two
and
called
upon
my
husband
with
a
message
from
an
old
friend
of
ours
it
appears
he
used
to
know
the
warricombes
when
they
lived
at
kingsmill
and
he
had
been
to
see
them
before
visiting
us
it
was
there
your
name
was
mentioned
to
him
godwin
had
seated
himself
and
leaned
forward
his
hands
grasping
the
glove
he
had
drawn
off
were
contemporaries
at
whitelaw
college
he
observed
we
learnt
from
him
he
spoke
of
you
with
the
greatest
interest
he
was
delighted
to
hear
that
you
contemplated
taking
orders
of
course
we
knew
chilvers
by
reputation
but
my
husband
had
no
idea
that
he
was
coming
to
exeter
what
an
energetic
man
he
is
in
a
few
hours
he
seemed
to
have
met
everyone
and
to
have
learnt
everything
my
husband
says
he
felt
quite
rebuked
by
such
a
display
of
vigour
even
in
his
discomposure
graver
than
any
that
had
affected
him
since
his
talks
with
buckland
warricombe
peak
was
able
to
notice
that
the
rev
bruno
had
not
made
a
wholly
favourable
impression
upon
the
lilywhites
there
was
an
amiable
causticity
in
that
mention
of
his
of
vigour
such
as
did
not
often
characterise
mrs
comments
finding
that
the
vicar
would
be
away
till
evening
godwin
stayed
for
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
when
he
had
escaped
it
irritated
and
alarmed
him
to
reflect
how
unusual
his
behaviour
must
have
appeared
to
the
good
lady
the
blow
was
aimed
at
his
from
such
an
unlikely
quarter
in
church
papers
he
had
frequently
come
across
name
and
the
sight
of
it
caused
him
a
twofold
disturbance
it
was
hateful
to
have
memories
of
humiliation
revived
and
perhaps
still
more
harassing
to
be
forced
upon
acknowledgment
of
the
fact
that
he
stood
as
an
obscure
aspirant
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
which
his
old
rival
was
triumphantly
ascending
bad
enough
to
be
classed
in
any
way
with
such
a
man
as
chilvers
but
to
be
regarded
as
at
one
with
him
in
religious
faith
to
be
forbidden
the
utterance
of
scorn
when
chilvers
was
extolled
stung
him
so
keenly
that
he
rushed
into
any
distraction
to
elude
the
thought
when
he
was
suffering
shame
under
the
gaze
of
buckland
warricombe
he
remembered
chilvers
and
shrank
as
before
a
merited
scoff
but
the
sensation
had
not
been
abiding
enough
to
affect
his
conduct
he
had
said
to
himself
that
he
should
never
come
in
contact
with
the
fellow
and
that
after
all
community
of
religious
profession
meant
no
more
under
their
respective
circumstances
than
if
both
were
following
law
or
physic
but
the
unforeseen
had
happened
in
a
few
months
the
rev
bruno
chilvers
would
be
a
prominent
figure
about
the
streets
of
exeter
would
be
frequently
seen
at
the
warricombes
at
the
lilywhites
at
the
houses
of
their
friends
his
sermons
at
margaret
would
doubtless
attract
and
form
a
staple
topic
of
conversation
worse
than
all
his
expressions
of
and
made
it
probable
that
he
would
seek
out
his
college
competitor
and
offer
the
hand
of
brotherhood
these
things
were
not
to
be
avoided
save
by
abandonment
of
hopes
save
by
retreat
by
yielding
to
a
hostile
destiny
that
chilvers
might
talk
here
and
there
of
whitelaw
stories
was
comparatively
unimportant
the
warricombes
must
already
know
all
that
could
be
told
and
what
other
people
heard
did
not
much
matter
it
was
the
man
himself
that
peak
could
not
endure
dissembling
had
hitherto
been
no
light
task
the
burden
had
more
than
once
pressed
so
gallingly
that
its
permanent
support
seemed
impossible
but
to
stand
before
bruno
chilvers
in
the
attitude
of
humble
emulation
to
give
respectful
ear
whilst
the
popular
cleric
advised
or
encouraged
or
bestowed
pontifical
praise
was
comparable
only
to
a
searing
of
the
flesh
with
red
irons
even
with
assured
prospect
of
recompense
in
the
shape
of
sidwell
warricombe
heart
and
hand
he
could
hardly
submit
to
such
an
ordeal
as
it
was
reason
having
so
often
convinced
him
that
he
clung
to
a
visionary
hope
the
torture
became
gratuitous
and
its
mere
suggestion
inspired
him
with
a
fierce
resentment
destructive
of
all
his
purposes
for
several
days
he
scarcely
left
the
house
to
wrath
and
dread
had
succeeded
a
wretched
torpor
during
which
his
mind
kept
revolving
the
thoughts
prompted
by
his
situation
turbidly
and
to
no
issue
he
tasted
all
the
bitterness
of
the
solitude
to
which
he
had
condemned
himself
there
was
not
a
living
soul
with
whom
he
could
commune
at
moments
he
was
possessed
with
the
desire
of
going
straightway
to
london
and
making
earwaker
the
confidant
of
all
his
folly
but
that
demanded
an
exertion
of
which
he
was
physically
incapable
he
thought
of
the
old
home
at
twybridge
and
was
tempted
also
in
that
direction
his
mother
would
welcome
him
with
human
kindness
beneath
her
roof
he
could
lie
dormant
until
fate
should
again
point
his
course
he
even
wrote
a
letter
saying
that
in
all
probability
he
should
pay
a
visit
to
twybridge
before
long
but
the
impulse
was
only
of
an
hour
duration
for
he
remembered
that
to
talk
with
his
mother
would
necessitate
all
manner
of
new
falsehoods
a
thickening
of
the
atmosphere
of
lies
which
already
oppressed
him
no
if
he
quitted
exeter
it
must
be
on
a
longer
journey
he
must
resume
his
purpose
of
seeking
some
distant
country
where
new
conditions
of
life
would
allow
him
to
try
his
fortune
at
least
as
an
honest
adventurer
in
many
parts
of
colonial
england
his
technical
knowledge
would
have
a
value
and
were
there
not
women
to
be
won
beneath
other
skies
women
perhaps
of
subtler
charm
than
the
old
hidebound
civilisation
produced
reminiscences
of
scenes
and
figures
in
novels
he
had
read
nourished
the
illusion
he
pictured
some
thriving
little
town
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
where
a
young
englishman
of
good
manners
and
unusual
culture
would
easily
be
admitted
to
the
intimacy
of
the
richest
families
he
saw
the
ideal
colonist
a
man
of
good
birth
but
a
sower
of
wild
oats
in
his
youth
with
two
or
three
daughters
about
him
beautiful
girls
wondrously
living
amid
romantic
dreams
of
the
old
world
and
of
the
lover
who
would
some
day
carry
them
off
with
a
substantial
share
of
papa
wealth
to
europe
and
the
scenes
of
their
imagination
the
mind
has
marvellous
methods
of
against
creeping
lethargy
of
despair
at
the
point
to
which
he
had
been
reduced
by
several
days
of
blank
despondency
peak
was
able
to
find
genuine
encouragement
in
visions
such
as
this
he
indulged
his
fancy
until
the
vital
force
began
to
stir
once
more
within
him
and
then
with
one
angry
sweep
all
his
theological
books
and
manuscripts
were
flung
out
of
sight
away
with
this
detestable
mummery
now
let
bruno
chilvers
pour
his
eloquence
from
the
pulpit
of
margaret
and
rear
to
what
heights
he
could
the
edifice
of
his
social
glory
men
of
that
stamp
were
alone
fitted
to
thrive
in
england
was
not
almost
certainly
a
hypocrite
masking
his
brains
for
brains
he
had
under
a
show
of
broadest
anglicanism
but
his
career
was
throughout
consistent
he
trod
in
the
footsteps
of
his
father
and
with
inherited
aptitude
moulded
antique
traditions
into
harmony
with
the
taste
of
the
times
compared
with
such
a
man
peak
felt
himself
a
bungler
the
wonder
was
that
his
clumsy
lying
had
escaped
detection
another
day
and
he
had
done
nothing
whatever
but
was
still
buoyed
up
by
the
reaction
of
visionary
hope
his
need
now
was
of
communicating
his
change
of
purpose
to
some
friendly
hearer
a
week
had
passed
since
he
had
exchanged
a
word
with
anyone
but
mrs
roots
and
converse
he
must
why
not
with
warricombe
that
was
plainly
the
next
step
to
see
martin
and
make
known
to
him
that
after
all
he
could
not
become
a
clergyman
no
need
of
hinting
a
conscientious
reason
at
all
events
nothing
more
definite
than
a
sense
of
personal
unfitness
a
growing
perception
of
difficulties
inherent
in
his
character
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
hear
warricombe
replies
a
few
minutes
after
this
decision
was
taken
he
set
off
towards
the
old
tiverton
road
walking
at
great
speed
flourishing
his
stick
symptoms
of
the
nervous
cramp
so
to
speak
which
he
was
dispelling
he
reached
the
house
and
his
hand
was
on
the
bell
when
an
unexpected
opening
of
the
door
presented
louis
warricombe
just
coming
forth
for
a
walk
they
exchanged
amiabilities
and
louis
made
known
that
his
father
and
mother
were
away
on
a
visit
to
friends
in
cornwall
pray
come
in
he
added
offering
to
peak
excused
himself
for
it
was
evident
that
louis
made
a
sacrifice
to
courtesy
but
at
that
moment
there
approached
from
the
garden
fanny
warricombe
and
her
friend
bertha
lilywhite
eldest
daughter
of
the
genial
vicar
they
shook
hands
with
godwin
fanny
exclaiming
go
away
mr
peak
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
sidwell
is
at
home
i
want
to
show
you
a
strange
sort
of
spleenwort
that
i
gathered
this
morning
that
case
said
her
brother
smiling
may
confess
that
i
have
an
appointment
pray
forgive
me
for
hurrying
off
mr
peak
godwin
was
embarrassed
but
the
sprightly
girl
repeated
her
summons
and
he
followed
into
the
house
chapter
v
having
led
the
way
to
the
fanny
retired
again
for
a
few
moments
to
fetch
the
fern
of
which
she
had
spoken
leaving
peak
in
conversation
with
little
miss
lilywhite
bertha
was
a
rather
shy
girl
of
fifteen
not
easily
induced
under
circumstances
such
as
these
to
utter
more
than
monosyllables
and
godwin
occupied
with
the
unforeseen
results
of
his
call
talked
about
the
weather
with
absurdity
he
had
begun
to
sketch
a
theory
of
his
own
regarding
and
estuaries
bertha
listening
with
an
air
of
the
gravest
attention
when
fanny
reappeared
followed
by
sidwell
peak
searched
the
latter
face
for
indications
of
her
mood
but
could
discover
nothing
save
a
spirit
of
gracious
welcome
such
aspect
was
a
matter
of
course
and
he
knew
it
none
the
less
his
nervousness
and
the
state
of
mind
engendered
by
a
week
miserable
solitude
tempted
him
to
believe
that
sidwell
did
not
always
wear
that
smile
in
greeting
a
casual
caller
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
received
him
without
the
countenance
of
warricombe
observing
her
perfect
manner
as
she
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
he
asked
himself
what
her
age
really
was
the
question
had
never
engaged
his
thoughts
eleven
years
ago
when
he
saw
her
at
the
house
near
kingsmill
and
again
at
whitelaw
college
she
looked
a
very
young
girl
but
whether
of
thirteen
or
sixteen
he
could
not
at
the
time
have
determined
and
such
a
margin
of
possibility
allowed
her
now
to
have
reached
it
might
be
her
summer
but
drew
perilously
near
to
thirty
no
no
sidwell
could
not
be
more
than
her
eyes
still
had
the
dewy
freshness
of
flowering
maidenhood
her
cheek
her
throat
were
so
exquisitely
young
in
how
divine
a
calm
must
this
girl
have
lived
to
show
even
at
features
as
little
marked
by
inward
perturbation
as
those
of
an
infant
her
position
in
the
world
considered
one
could
forgive
her
for
having
borne
so
lightly
the
inevitable
sorrows
of
life
for
having
dismissed
so
readily
the
spiritual
doubts
which
were
the
heritage
of
her
time
but
was
she
a
total
stranger
to
passion
did
not
the
fact
of
her
still
remaining
unmarried
make
probable
such
a
deficiency
in
her
nature
had
she
a
place
among
the
women
whom
coldness
of
temperament
preserves
in
a
bloom
like
that
of
youth
until
fading
hair
and
sinking
cheek
betray
them
whilst
he
thought
thus
godwin
was
in
appearance
busy
with
the
fern
fanny
had
brought
for
his
inspection
he
talked
about
it
but
in
snatches
with
intervals
of
abstractedness
yet
might
he
not
be
altogether
wrong
last
year
when
he
observed
sidwell
in
the
cathedral
and
subsequently
at
home
his
impression
had
been
that
her
face
was
of
rather
pallid
and
dreamy
cast
he
recollected
that
distinctly
had
she
changed
or
did
familiarity
make
him
less
sensible
of
her
finer
traits
possibly
she
enjoyed
better
health
nowadays
and
if
so
it
might
result
from
influences
other
than
physical
her
air
of
quiet
happiness
seemed
to
him
especially
noticeable
this
afternoon
and
as
he
brooded
there
came
upon
him
a
dread
which
under
the
circumstances
was
quite
irrational
but
for
all
that
troubled
his
views
perhaps
sidwell
was
betrothed
to
some
one
he
knew
of
but
one
likely
person
miss
moorhouse
brother
about
a
month
ago
the
warricombes
had
been
on
a
visit
at
budleigh
salterton
and
something
might
then
have
happened
pangs
of
jealousy
smote
him
nor
could
he
assuage
them
by
reminding
himself
that
he
had
no
concern
whatever
in
sidwell
future
warricombe
be
long
away
he
asked
coldly
day
or
two
i
hope
you
did
wish
particularly
to
see
him
no
you
know
mr
peak
put
in
fanny
we
are
all
going
to
london
next
month
to
live
there
for
half
a
year
godwin
exhibited
surprise
he
looked
from
the
speaker
to
her
sister
and
sidwell
as
she
smiled
confirmation
bent
very
slightly
towards
him
have
made
up
our
minds
after
much
uncertainty
she
said
brother
buckland
seems
to
think
that
we
are
falling
behind
in
civilisation
we
are
affirmed
fanny
mr
peak
would
admit
if
only
he
could
be
sincere
i
never
sincere
then
miss
fanny
godwin
asked
only
meant
to
say
that
nobody
can
be
when
the
rules
of
politeness
interfere
do
you
think
it
a
pity
we
might
tell
one
another
the
truth
in
a
pleasant
way
agree
with
you
but
then
we
must
be
civilised
indeed
how
do
you
think
of
london
miss
warricombe
which
of
its
aspects
most
impresses
you
sidwell
answered
rather
indefinitely
and
ended
by
mentioning
that
in
which
she
had
just
charlotte
bronte
makes
a
contrast
between
the
city
and
the
west
end
and
greatly
prefers
the
former
you
agree
with
her
mr
peak
i
ca
one
understands
the
mood
in
which
she
wrote
that
but
a
little
more
experience
would
have
led
her
to
see
the
contrast
in
a
different
light
that
term
the
west
end
includes
much
that
is
despicable
but
it
means
also
the
best
results
of
civilisation
the
city
is
hateful
to
me
and
for
a
reason
which
i
only
understood
after
many
an
hour
of
depression
in
walking
about
its
streets
it
represents
the
ascendency
of
the
average
man
sidwell
waited
for
fuller
explanation
liberal
mind
peak
continued
revolted
by
the
triumphal
procession
that
roars
perpetually
through
the
city
highways
with
myriad
voices
the
city
bellows
its
brutal
scorn
of
everything
but
material
advantage
there
every
humanising
influence
is
contemptuously
disregarded
i
know
of
course
that
the
trader
may
have
his
quiet
home
where
art
and
science
and
humanity
are
the
first
considerations
but
the
of
traders
corporate
and
victorious
crush
all
such
things
beneath
their
heels
take
your
stand
or
try
to
do
so
anywhere
near
the
exchange
the
hustling
and
jolting
to
which
you
are
exposed
represents
the
very
spirit
of
the
life
about
you
whatever
is
gentle
and
kindly
and
meditative
must
here
go
to
the
wall
trampled
spattered
ridiculed
here
the
average
man
has
it
all
his
own
way
a
gross
utilitarian
power
i
can
see
that
sidwell
replied
thoughtfully
perhaps
it
also
represents
the
triumphant
forces
of
our
time
he
looked
keenly
at
her
with
a
smile
of
delight
also
the
power
which
centres
in
the
plutocracy
in
conversing
with
sidwell
he
had
never
before
found
an
opportunity
of
uttering
his
vehement
prejudices
the
gentler
side
of
his
character
had
sometimes
expressed
itself
but
those
impulses
which
were
vastly
more
significant
lay
hidden
beneath
the
dissimulation
he
consistently
practised
for
the
first
time
he
was
able
to
look
into
sidwell
face
with
honest
directness
and
what
he
saw
there
strengthened
his
determination
to
talk
on
with
the
same
freedom
do
believe
then
said
sidwell
democracy
is
the
proper
name
for
the
state
into
which
we
are
passing
if
one
can
understand
democracy
as
the
opening
of
social
privileges
to
free
competition
amongst
men
of
trade
and
social
privilege
is
everything
home
politics
refer
to
nothing
else
fanny
true
to
the
ingenuous
principle
of
her
years
put
a
direct
question
you
approve
of
real
democracy
mr
peak
he
answered
with
another
question
you
read
the
life
of
phokion
in
plutarch
i
sorry
to
say
a
story
about
him
which
i
have
enjoyed
since
i
was
your
age
phokion
was
once
delivering
a
public
speech
and
at
a
certain
point
the
majority
of
his
hearers
broke
into
applause
whereupon
he
turned
to
certain
of
his
friends
who
stood
near
and
asked
what
have
i
said
amiss
fanny
laughed
you
despise
public
opinion
heart
and
soul
it
was
to
sidwell
that
he
directed
the
reply
though
overcome
by
the
joy
of
such
an
utterance
he
felt
that
considering
the
opinions
and
position
of
buckland
warricombe
he
was
perhaps
guilty
of
ill
manners
but
sidwell
manifested
no
disapproval
you
know
that
story
fanny
asked
of
her
quite
new
to
me
i
sure
you
read
the
life
of
phokion
as
soon
as
possible
he
will
just
suit
you
sidwell
peak
heard
this
with
a
shock
of
surprise
which
thrilled
in
him
deliciously
he
had
the
strongest
desire
to
look
again
at
sidwell
but
refrained
as
no
one
spoke
he
turned
to
bertha
lilywhite
and
put
a
commonplace
question
a
servant
entered
with
the
and
placed
it
on
a
small
table
near
fanny
godwin
looked
at
the
younger
girl
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
an
excess
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
had
a
glance
from
sidwell
rebuked
her
with
his
usual
rapidity
of
observation
and
inference
he
made
much
of
this
trifle
contrary
to
what
he
expected
sidwell
next
remark
was
in
a
tone
of
cheerfulness
almost
of
gaiety
advantage
of
our
stay
in
london
will
be
that
home
will
seem
more
delightful
than
ever
when
we
return
suppose
you
wo
be
back
till
next
summer
am
afraid
not
you
be
living
here
then
fanny
inquired
very
doubtful
he
wished
to
answer
with
a
decided
negative
but
his
tongue
refused
sidwell
was
regarding
him
with
calm
but
earnest
eyes
and
he
knew
without
caring
to
reflect
that
his
latest
projects
were
crumbling
you
been
to
see
our
friends
at
budleigh
salterton
yet
she
asked
yet
i
hope
to
in
a
few
days
pursuing
the
subject
he
was
able
to
examine
her
face
as
she
spoke
of
moorhouse
his
conjecture
was
assuredly
baseless
fanny
and
bertha
began
to
talk
together
of
domestic
affairs
and
presently
when
were
laid
aside
the
two
girls
went
to
another
part
of
the
room
then
they
withdrew
altogether
peak
was
monologising
on
english
art
as
represented
at
the
academy
but
finding
himself
alone
with
sidwell
it
had
never
before
happened
he
became
silent
ought
he
to
take
his
leave
he
must
already
have
been
sitting
here
more
than
but
the
temptation
of
was
irresistible
had
a
visit
from
chilvers
the
other
day
he
remarked
abruptly
did
he
call
to
see
you
her
tone
gave
evidence
that
she
would
not
have
introduced
this
topic
i
heard
from
lilywhite
he
had
been
to
the
vicarage
has
he
changed
much
since
he
was
at
whitelaw
many
years
must
make
a
difference
at
that
time
of
life
sidwell
answered
smiling
does
he
show
the
same
peculiarities
of
manner
he
tried
to
put
the
question
without
insistency
in
a
tone
quite
compatible
with
friendliness
her
answer
given
with
a
look
of
amusement
satisfied
him
that
there
was
no
fear
of
her
taking
mr
chilvers
too
seriously
i
think
he
speaks
in
much
the
same
way
you
read
any
of
his
publications
or
two
we
have
his
lecture
on
happen
to
know
it
there
are
good
things
in
it
i
think
but
i
dislike
his
modern
interpretation
of
old
principles
think
it
dangerous
he
no
longer
regarded
her
frankly
and
in
the
consciousness
of
her
look
upon
him
he
knit
his
brows
think
it
both
dangerous
and
offensive
not
a
few
clergymen
nowadays
who
imagine
themselves
free
from
the
letter
and
wholly
devoted
to
spirit
are
doing
their
best
in
the
cause
of
materialism
they
surrender
the
very
points
at
issue
between
religion
and
worldliness
they
are
so
blinded
by
a
vague
humanitarian
impulse
as
to
make
the
new
testament
an
oracle
of
popular
radicalism
sidwell
looked
up
never
quite
understood
mr
peak
how
you
regard
radicalism
you
think
it
opposed
to
all
true
progress
as
concerns
any
reasonable
limit
of
time
as
you
know
maintains
that
spiritual
progress
is
only
possible
by
this
way
ca
venture
to
contradict
him
said
godwin
it
may
be
that
advance
is
destined
only
to
come
after
long
retrogression
and
anarchy
perhaps
the
way
lie
through
such
miseries
but
we
ca
foresee
that
with
certainty
and
those
of
us
who
hate
the
present
tendency
of
things
must
needs
assert
their
hatred
as
strongly
as
possible
seeing
that
we
have
a
more
hopeful
part
to
play
than
seems
likely
like
that
view
replied
sidwell
in
an
undertone
belief
pursued
godwin
with
an
earnestness
very
agreeable
to
himself
for
he
had
reached
the
subject
on
which
he
could
speak
honestly
that
an
instructed
man
can
only
hold
views
such
as
your
brother
hopeful
views
of
the
immediate
future
if
he
has
never
been
brought
into
close
contact
with
the
lower
classes
buckland
know
the
people
for
whom
he
pleads
think
them
so
degraded
is
impossible
without
seeming
inhumanly
scornful
to
give
a
just
account
of
their
ignorance
and
baseness
the
two
things
speaking
generally
go
together
of
the
ignorant
there
are
very
few
indeed
who
can
think
purely
or
aspiringly
you
of
course
object
the
teaching
of
christianity
but
the
lowly
and
the
humble
of
whom
it
speaks
scarcely
exist
scarcely
can
exist
in
our
day
and
country
a
ludicrous
pretence
of
education
is
banishing
every
form
of
native
simplicity
in
the
large
towns
the
populace
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
vicious
vulgarity
and
every
rural
district
is
being
affected
by
the
spread
of
contagion
to
flatter
the
proletariat
is
to
fight
against
all
the
good
that
still
characterises
educated
england
against
reverence
for
the
beautiful
against
magnanimity
against
enthusiasm
of
mind
heart
and
soul
he
quivered
with
vehemence
of
feeling
and
the
flush
which
rose
to
his
hearer
cheek
the
swimming
brightness
of
her
eye
proved
that
a
strong
sympathy
stirred
within
her
know
nothing
of
the
uneducated
in
towns
she
said
the
little
i
have
seen
of
them
in
country
places
certainly
supports
your
opinion
i
could
point
to
two
or
three
families
who
have
suffered
distinct
degradation
owing
to
what
most
people
call
an
improvement
in
their
circumstances
father
often
speaks
of
such
instances
comparing
the
state
of
things
now
with
what
he
can
remember
own
experience
pursued
godwin
been
among
the
lower
classes
in
london
i
do
mean
the
very
poorest
of
whom
one
hears
so
much
nowadays
i
never
went
among
them
because
i
had
no
power
of
helping
them
and
the
sight
of
their
vileness
would
only
have
moved
me
to
unjust
hatred
but
the
people
who
earn
enough
for
their
needs
and
whose
spiritual
guide
is
the
sunday
newspaper
i
know
them
because
for
a
long
time
i
was
obliged
to
lodge
in
their
houses
only
a
consuming
fire
could
purify
the
places
where
they
dwell
do
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
charging
them
with
what
are
commonly
held
vices
and
crimes
but
with
the
consistent
love
of
everything
that
is
ignoble
with
utter
deadness
to
generous
impulse
with
the
fatal
habit
of
low
mockery
and
are
the
people
who
really
direct
the
democratic
movement
they
set
the
tone
in
politics
they
are
debasing
art
and
literature
even
the
homes
of
wealthy
people
begin
to
show
the
effects
of
their
influence
one
hears
men
and
women
of
gentle
birth
using
phrases
which
originate
with
shopboys
one
sees
them
reading
print
which
is
addressed
to
the
coarsest
million
they
crowd
to
entertainments
which
are
deliberately
adapted
to
the
lowest
order
of
mind
when
commercial
interest
is
supreme
how
can
the
tastes
of
the
majority
fail
to
lead
and
control
though
he
spoke
from
the
depths
of
his
conviction
and
was
so
moved
that
his
voice
rose
and
fell
in
tones
such
as
a
seldom
hears
he
yet
kept
anxious
watch
upon
sidwell
countenance
that
hint
afforded
him
by
fanny
was
invaluable
it
had
enabled
him
to
appeal
to
sidwell
nature
by
the
ardent
expression
of
what
was
sincerest
in
his
own
she
too
he
at
length
understood
had
the
aristocratic
temperament
this
explained
her
to
him
supplied
the
key
of
doubts
and
difficulties
which
had
troubled
him
in
her
presence
it
justified
moreover
the
feelings
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
feelings
which
this
hour
of
intimate
converse
had
exalted
to
passion
his
heart
thrilled
with
hope
where
sympathies
so
profound
existed
what
did
it
matter
that
there
was
variance
on
a
few
points
between
his
intellect
and
hers
he
felt
the
power
to
win
her
and
to
defy
every
passing
humiliation
that
lay
in
his
course
sidwell
raised
her
eyes
with
a
look
which
signified
that
she
was
shaping
a
question
diffidently
you
always
thought
so
hopelessly
of
our
times
i
had
my
stage
of
optimism
he
answered
smiling
i
never
put
faith
in
the
masses
i
once
believed
that
the
conversion
of
the
educated
to
a
purely
human
religion
would
set
things
moving
in
the
right
way
it
was
ignorance
of
the
world
he
paused
a
moment
then
added
youth
one
marvels
that
men
remain
at
so
low
a
stage
of
civilisation
later
in
life
one
is
astonished
that
they
have
advanced
so
far
sidwell
met
his
look
with
appreciative
intelligence
and
murmured
spite
of
myself
i
believe
that
expresses
a
truth
peak
was
about
to
reply
when
fanny
and
her
friend
reappeared
bertha
approached
for
the
purpose
of
taking
leave
and
for
a
minute
or
two
sidwell
talked
with
her
the
young
girls
withdrew
again
together
by
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
nearly
six
godwin
did
not
resume
his
seat
though
sidwell
had
done
so
he
looked
towards
the
window
and
was
all
but
lost
in
abstraction
when
the
soft
voice
again
addressed
him
you
have
not
chosen
your
life
work
without
some
hope
of
doing
good
you
think
he
asked
gently
i
shall
be
out
of
place
in
the
christian
church
no
i
certainly
do
think
that
but
will
you
tell
me
what
you
have
set
before
yourself
he
drew
nearer
and
leaned
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
hope
for
what
i
shall
perhaps
never
attain
whatever
my
first
steps
may
be
i
am
not
independent
i
must
take
the
work
that
offers
it
is
my
ambition
to
become
the
teacher
of
some
rural
parish
which
is
still
unpolluted
by
the
influences
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
or
at
all
events
is
still
capable
of
being
rescued
for
work
in
crowded
centres
i
am
altogether
unfit
my
prejudices
are
too
strong
i
should
do
far
more
harm
than
good
but
among
a
few
simple
people
i
think
my
efforts
might
be
useless
i
ca
pretend
to
care
for
anything
but
individuals
the
few
whom
i
know
and
love
are
of
more
importance
to
me
than
all
the
blind
multitude
rushing
to
destruction
i
hate
the
word
it
is
the
few
the
very
few
that
have
always
kept
alive
whatever
of
effectual
good
we
see
in
the
human
race
there
are
individuals
who
outweigh
in
every
kind
of
value
generations
of
ordinary
people
to
some
remote
little
community
i
hope
to
give
the
best
energies
of
my
life
my
teaching
will
avoid
doctrine
and
controversy
i
shall
take
the
spirit
of
the
gospels
and
labour
to
make
it
a
practical
guide
no
doubt
you
find
inconsistencies
in
me
but
remember
that
i
shall
not
declare
myself
to
those
i
instruct
as
i
have
done
to
you
i
have
been
laying
stress
on
my
antipathies
in
the
future
it
will
be
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
to
forget
these
and
foster
my
sympathies
which
also
are
strong
when
opportunity
is
given
them
sidwell
listened
her
face
bent
downwards
but
not
hidden
from
the
speaker
nature
is
intolerant
he
went
on
i
am
easily
roused
to
an
antagonism
which
destroys
my
peace
it
is
only
by
living
apart
amid
friendly
circumstances
that
i
can
cultivate
the
qualities
useful
to
myself
and
others
the
sense
that
my
life
was
being
wasted
determined
me
a
year
ago
to
escape
the
world
uproar
and
prepare
myself
in
quietness
for
this
task
the
resolve
was
taken
here
in
your
house
you
quite
sure
asked
sidwell
such
simple
duties
and
satisfactions
the
sentence
remained
incomplete
or
rather
was
finished
in
the
timid
glance
she
gave
him
a
life
would
be
possible
to
me
he
replied
with
unsteady
voice
i
were
condemned
to
intellectual
solitude
but
i
have
dared
to
hope
that
i
shall
not
always
be
alone
a
parched
throat
would
have
stayed
his
utterance
even
if
words
had
offered
themselves
but
sudden
confusion
beset
his
mind
a
sense
of
having
been
guilty
of
monstrous
presumption
a
panic
which
threw
darkness
about
him
and
made
him
grasp
the
chair
convulsively
when
he
recovered
himself
and
looked
at
sidwell
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
her
lips
inexpressibly
gentle
the
rough
outline
of
my
projects
he
said
in
his
ordinary
voice
moving
a
few
steps
away
see
that
i
count
much
on
fortune
at
the
best
it
may
be
years
before
i
can
get
my
country
living
with
a
laugh
he
came
towards
her
and
offered
his
hand
for
sidwell
rose
have
interested
me
very
much
whatever
assistance
it
may
be
in
my
father
power
to
offer
you
i
am
sure
you
may
count
upon
am
already
much
indebted
to
warricombe
kindness
they
shook
hands
without
further
speech
and
peak
went
his
way
for
an
hour
or
two
he
was
powerless
to
collect
his
thoughts
all
he
had
said
repeated
itself
again
and
again
mixed
up
with
turbid
comments
with
deadly
fears
and
frantic
bursts
of
confidence
with
tumult
of
passion
and
merciless
logic
of
did
sidwell
understand
that
sentence
have
dared
to
hope
that
i
shall
not
always
be
alone
was
it
not
possible
that
she
might
interpret
it
as
referring
to
some
unknown
woman
whom
he
loved
if
not
if
his
voice
and
features
had
betrayed
him
what
could
her
behaviour
mean
except
distinct
encouragement
have
interested
me
very
much
but
could
she
have
used
such
words
if
his
meaning
had
been
plain
to
her
far
more
likely
that
her
frank
kindness
came
of
misconception
she
imagined
him
the
lover
of
some
girl
of
his
own
a
toiling
governess
or
some
such
person
it
could
not
enter
into
her
mind
that
he
so
recklessly
as
the
truth
implied
but
the
glow
of
sympathy
with
which
she
heard
his
immeasurable
scorn
there
was
the
spirit
that
defies
artificial
distances
why
had
he
not
been
bolder
at
this
rate
he
must
spend
a
lifetime
in
preparing
for
the
decisive
moment
when
would
another
such
occasion
offer
itself
women
are
won
by
audacity
the
poets
have
repeated
it
from
age
to
age
and
some
truth
there
must
be
in
the
saying
suspicion
of
could
not
but
attach
to
him
that
was
inherent
in
the
circumstances
he
must
rely
upon
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
which
indeed
was
beginning
to
rack
and
rend
him
a
woman
is
sensitive
to
that
especially
a
woman
of
sidwell
refinement
in
matters
of
the
intellect
she
may
be
misled
but
she
can
not
mistake
quivering
ardour
for
design
simulating
love
if
it
were
impossible
to
see
her
again
in
private
before
she
left
exeter
then
he
must
write
to
her
half
a
year
of
complete
uncertainty
and
of
counterfeiting
face
to
face
with
bruno
chilvers
would
overtax
his
resolution
the
evening
went
by
he
knew
not
how
long
after
nightfall
he
was
returning
from
an
aimless
ramble
by
way
of
the
old
tiverton
road
at
least
he
would
pass
the
house
and
soothe
or
inflame
his
emotions
by
resting
for
a
moment
thus
near
to
sidwell
what
he
had
believed
himself
incapable
of
erotic
madness
and
he
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
stones
of
the
wall
to
relieve
his
sick
dizziness
it
was
sidwell
or
death
into
what
a
void
of
hideous
futility
would
his
life
be
cast
if
this
desire
proved
vain
and
he
were
left
to
combat
alone
with
the
memory
of
his
dishonour
with
sidwell
the
reproach
could
be
outlived
she
would
understand
him
pardon
him
and
thereafter
a
glorified
existence
rivalling
that
of
whosoever
has
been
most
exultant
among
the
sons
of
men
part
iv
chapter
i
earwaker
struggle
with
the
of
weekly
and
the
journalist
kenyon
came
to
its
natural
close
about
a
month
after
godwin
peak
disappearance
only
a
vein
of
obstinacy
in
his
character
had
kept
him
so
long
in
a
position
he
knew
to
be
untenable
from
the
first
his
sympathy
with
runcorn
politics
had
been
doubtful
and
experience
of
the
working
of
a
sunday
newspaper
which
appealed
to
the
ignobly
restive
could
not
encourage
his
adhesion
to
this
form
of
radicalism
he
anticipated
dismissal
by
retirement
and
kenyon
a
man
of
coarsely
vigorous
fibre
at
once
stepped
into
his
place
now
that
he
had
leisure
to
review
the
conflict
earwaker
understood
that
circumstances
had
but
hastened
his
transition
from
a
moderate
ardour
in
the
parliamentary
cause
of
the
people
to
a
regretful
neutrality
regarding
all
political
movements
birth
allied
him
with
the
proletarian
class
and
his
sentiment
in
favour
of
democracy
was
unendangered
by
the
disillusions
which
must
come
upon
every
intellectual
man
brought
into
close
contact
with
public
affairs
the
course
of
an
education
essentially
aristocratic
greek
and
latin
can
have
no
other
tendency
so
long
as
they
are
the
privilege
of
the
few
had
not
affected
his
natural
bent
nor
was
he
the
man
to
be
driven
into
reaction
because
of
obstacles
to
his
faith
inseparable
from
human
weakness
he
had
learnt
that
the
emancipation
of
the
poor
and
untaught
must
proceed
more
slowly
than
he
once
hoped
that
was
all
restored
to
generous
calm
he
could
admit
that
such
men
as
runcorn
and
kenyon
the
one
with
his
polyarchic
commercialism
the
other
with
his
demagogic
violence
had
possibly
a
useful
part
to
play
at
the
present
stage
of
things
he
however
could
have
no
place
in
that
camp
too
indiscreetly
he
had
hoisted
his
standard
of
idealism
and
by
stubborn
resistance
of
insuperable
forces
he
had
merely
brought
forward
the
least
satisfactory
elements
of
his
own
character
on
cried
malkin
the
grovellers
to
the
end
but
earwaker
had
begun
to
see
himself
in
a
light
of
ridicule
there
was
just
time
to
save
his
he
was
in
no
concern
for
his
daily
bread
with
narrower
resources
in
the
world
of
print
he
might
have
been
compelled
like
many
another
journalist
to
swallow
his
objections
and
write
as
runcorn
dictated
for
the
humble
folks
at
home
could
not
starve
to
allow
him
the
luxury
of
conscientiousness
whatever
he
might
have
been
disposed
to
do
on
his
own
account
happily
his
pen
had
a
scope
beyond
politics
and
by
working
steadily
for
reviews
with
which
he
was
already
connected
he
would
be
able
to
keep
his
finances
in
reasonable
order
until
perchance
some
hopeful
appointment
offered
itself
in
a
mood
of
much
cheerfulness
he
turned
for
ever
from
party
uproar
and
focused
his
mind
upon
those
interests
of
humanity
which
so
rarely
coincide
with
the
aims
of
any
league
among
men
half
a
year
went
by
and
at
length
he
granted
himself
a
short
holiday
the
first
in
a
twelvemonth
it
took
the
form
of
a
voyage
to
marseilles
and
thence
of
a
leisurely
ramble
up
the
rhone
before
returning
he
spent
a
day
or
two
in
paris
for
the
most
part
beneath
cafe
awnings
or
on
garden
seats
an
indulgence
of
contented
laziness
on
the
day
of
his
departure
he
climbed
the
towers
of
notre
dame
and
lingered
for
in
pleasant
solitude
among
the
stone
monsters
his
reverie
was
broken
by
an
english
voice
loud
and
animated
and
look
at
this
old
demon
of
a
bird
he
has
always
been
a
favourite
of
sure
you
not
tired
miss
bella
when
you
want
to
rest
miss
lily
mind
you
say
so
at
once
what
a
day
what
a
sky
when
i
was
last
up
here
i
had
my
hat
blown
away
i
watched
it
as
far
as
montmartre
a
fact
never
knew
such
a
wind
in
my
life
unless
it
was
that
tornado
i
told
you
about
hollo
by
the
powers
if
that
earwaker
confound
you
old
fellow
how
the
deuce
do
you
do
what
a
glorious
meeting
had
the
least
idea
where
you
were
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
jacox
and
to
miss
jacox
and
to
miss
lily
they
all
know
you
thoroughly
well
now
who
would
have
thought
of
our
meeting
up
here
glorious
it
was
with
some
curiosity
that
earwaker
regarded
the
companions
of
his
friend
malkin
whose
proximity
was
the
last
thing
he
could
have
imagined
as
only
a
few
weeks
ago
he
had
heard
of
the
restless
departing
on
business
unknown
for
boston
us
jacox
the
widow
whose
wrongs
had
made
such
an
impression
on
malkin
announced
herself
in
a
thin
mealy
face
and
figure
as
not
less
than
forty
though
her
irresponsible
look
made
it
evident
that
years
profited
her
nothing
and
suggested
an
explanation
of
the
success
with
which
she
had
been
victimised
she
was
stylishly
dressed
and
had
the
air
of
enjoying
an
unusual
treat
her
children
were
of
more
promising
type
though
earwaker
would
hardly
have
supposed
them
so
old
as
he
knew
them
to
be
bella
just
beyond
her
fourteenth
year
had
an
intelligent
prettiness
but
was
excessively
shy
in
giving
her
hand
to
the
stranger
she
flushed
over
face
and
neck
and
her
bosom
palpitated
visibly
her
sister
two
years
younger
was
a
mere
child
rather
but
of
laughing
temper
their
toilet
suited
ill
with
that
of
their
mother
its
plainness
and
negligence
might
have
passed
muster
in
london
but
here
under
the
lucent
sky
it
seemed
a
wrong
to
their
budding
maidenhood
jacox
is
on
the
point
of
returning
to
england
malkin
explained
happened
to
meet
her
by
chance
i
always
meeting
my
friends
by
chance
you
for
instance
earwaker
she
is
so
good
as
to
allow
me
to
guide
her
and
the
young
ladies
to
a
few
of
the
sights
of
paris
mr
malkin
exclaimed
the
widow
with
a
stress
on
the
exclamation
peculiar
to
herself
two
notes
of
deprecating
falsetto
can
you
say
it
is
good
of
me
when
i
sure
there
are
no
words
for
your
kindness
to
us
all
if
only
you
knew
our
debt
to
your
friend
mr
earwaker
to
our
dying
day
we
must
all
remember
it
it
is
entirely
through
malkin
that
we
are
able
to
leave
that
most
disagreeable
rouen
a
place
i
shall
never
cease
to
think
of
with
horror
o
mr
earwaker
you
have
only
to
think
of
that
wretched
railway
station
stuck
between
two
black
tunnels
o
mr
malkin
are
you
doing
malkin
inquired
of
the
journalist
long
shall
you
be
here
why
have
i
heard
from
you
go
to
london
we
on
friday
i
look
you
up
stay
ca
you
dine
with
me
this
evening
anywhere
you
like
these
ladies
will
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
and
to
dine
in
peace
at
their
hotel
mr
malkin
piped
the
widow
know
how
very
far
that
is
from
the
truth
but
we
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
to
know
that
you
are
enjoying
yourself
with
mr
earwaker
the
friends
made
an
appointment
to
meet
near
the
madeleine
and
earwaker
hastened
to
escape
the
sound
of
jacox
voice
punctual
at
the
rendezvous
malkin
talked
with
his
wonted
effusiveness
as
he
led
towards
the
cafe
anglais
managed
it
my
boy
the
most
complete
success
i
had
to
run
over
to
boston
to
get
hold
of
a
scoundrelly
relative
of
that
poor
woman
you
should
have
seen
how
i
came
over
him
partly
dignified
sternness
partly
justifiable
cajolery
the
affair
only
wanted
some
one
to
take
it
up
in
earnest
i
have
secured
her
about
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
withheld
on
the
most
paltry
and
transparent
pretences
going
to
live
at
wrotham
in
kent
where
mrs
jacox
has
friends
i
never
thought
myself
so
much
of
a
man
of
business
of
course
old
haliburton
the
lawyer
had
a
hand
in
it
but
without
my
personal
energy
it
would
have
taken
him
a
year
longer
what
do
you
think
of
the
girls
how
do
you
like
bella
pretty
child
well
yes
yes
immature
of
course
but
i
rather
in
the
habit
of
thinking
of
her
as
a
young
lady
in
three
years
she
be
seventeen
you
know
of
course
you
could
form
a
judgment
of
her
character
she
quite
remarkably
mature
for
her
age
and
what
delights
me
most
of
all
a
sturdy
radical
she
takes
the
most
intelligent
interest
in
all
political
and
social
movements
i
assure
you
there
a
great
deal
of
democratic
fire
in
her
sure
it
is
reflected
from
your
own
fervour
a
bit
of
it
you
should
have
seen
her
excitement
when
we
were
at
the
bastille
column
yesterday
she
make
a
splendid
woman
i
assure
you
lily
very
interesting
too
profoundly
interesting
but
then
she
is
certainly
very
young
so
i
ca
feel
so
sure
of
her
on
the
great
questions
she
has
her
sister
earnestness
i
fancy
in
the
of
dinner
malkin
became
still
more
confidential
remember
what
i
said
to
you
long
since
my
mind
is
made
up
practically
made
up
i
shall
devote
myself
to
bella
education
in
the
hope
you
understand
me
impossible
to
have
found
a
girl
who
suited
better
with
my
aspirations
she
has
known
the
hardships
of
poverty
poor
thing
and
that
will
keep
her
for
ever
in
sympathy
with
the
downtrodden
classes
she
has
a
splendid
intelligence
and
it
shall
be
cultivated
to
the
utmost
word
said
earwaker
soberly
have
heard
before
of
men
who
waited
for
girls
to
grow
up
be
cautious
my
dear
fellow
both
on
your
own
account
and
hers
dear
earwaker
do
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
take
it
for
granted
she
will
get
to
be
fond
of
me
my
attitude
is
one
of
the
most
absolute
discretion
you
must
have
observed
how
i
behaved
to
them
all
scrupulous
courtesy
i
trust
no
more
familiarity
than
any
friend
might
be
permitted
i
should
never
dream
of
addressing
the
girls
without
ceremonious
prefix
never
i
talk
of
bella
education
but
be
assured
that
i
regard
my
own
as
a
matter
of
quite
as
much
importance
i
mean
that
i
shall
strive
incessantly
to
make
myself
worthy
of
her
no
laxity
for
these
next
three
years
i
shall
live
as
becomes
a
man
who
has
his
eyes
constantly
on
a
high
ideal
the
pure
and
beautiful
girl
whom
he
humbly
hopes
to
win
for
a
wife
the
listener
was
moved
he
raised
his
to
conceal
the
smile
which
might
have
been
misunderstood
in
his
heart
he
felt
more
admiration
than
had
yet
mingled
with
his
liking
for
this
strange
fellow
jacox
herself
pursued
malkin
has
her
weaknesses
as
we
all
have
i
do
think
her
a
very
woman
to
tell
the
truth
but
there
a
great
deal
of
goodness
in
her
if
there
one
thing
i
desire
in
people
it
is
the
virtue
of
gratitude
and
mrs
jacox
is
grateful
almost
to
excess
for
the
paltry
exertions
i
have
made
on
her
behalf
you
know
that
kind
of
thing
costs
me
nothing
you
know
i
like
running
about
and
getting
things
done
but
the
poor
woman
imagines
that
i
have
laid
her
under
an
eternal
obligation
of
course
i
shall
show
her
in
time
that
it
was
nothing
at
all
that
she
might
have
done
just
as
much
for
herself
if
she
had
known
how
to
go
about
it
earwaker
was
musing
a
wrinkle
of
uneasiness
at
the
corner
of
his
eye
is
the
kind
of
woman
you
know
one
can
regard
as
a
mother
but
we
are
the
best
possible
friends
she
perhaps
think
of
me
as
a
possible
poor
thing
i
hope
she
does
perhaps
it
will
help
to
put
her
mind
at
rest
about
the
girls
shall
you
often
be
down
at
wrotham
inquired
the
journalist
abstractedly
not
often
that
is
to
say
only
once
a
month
or
so
just
to
look
in
i
wanted
to
ask
you
do
you
think
i
might
venture
to
begin
a
correspondence
with
bella
m
m
i
ca
say
would
be
so
valuable
you
know
i
could
suggest
books
for
her
reading
i
could
help
her
in
her
study
of
politics
and
so
on
think
about
it
but
be
cautious
i
beg
of
you
now
i
must
be
off
only
just
time
enough
to
get
my
traps
to
the
station
come
with
you
gare
du
nord
oh
plenty
of
time
plenty
of
time
nothing
so
abominable
as
waiting
for
trains
i
make
a
point
of
never
getting
to
the
station
more
than
three
minutes
before
time
astonishing
what
one
can
do
in
three
minutes
i
want
to
tell
you
about
an
adventure
i
had
in
boston
met
a
fellow
so
devilish
like
peak
that
i
believe
it
was
he
himself
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
swore
that
he
knew
not
the
man
never
saw
such
a
likeness
it
may
have
been
peak
all
that
suspicious
i
ca
help
thinking
the
same
he
had
an
english
accent
too
business
this
of
peak
i
hope
i
may
live
to
hear
the
end
of
the
story
they
left
the
restaurant
and
in
a
few
hours
earwaker
was
again
on
english
soil
at
staple
inn
a
pile
of
letters
awaited
him
among
them
a
note
from
christian
moxey
asking
for
an
appointment
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
journalist
return
earwaker
at
once
sent
an
invitation
and
on
the
next
evening
moxey
came
an
intimacy
had
grown
up
between
the
two
since
the
mysterious
retreat
of
their
common
friend
christian
was
at
first
lost
without
the
companionship
of
godwin
peak
he
forsook
his
studies
and
fell
into
a
state
of
complete
idleness
which
naturally
fostered
his
tendency
to
find
solace
in
the
decanter
with
earwaker
he
could
not
talk
as
unreservedly
as
with
peak
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
tonic
influence
in
the
journalist
personality
which
he
recognised
as
beneficial
earwaker
was
steadily
making
his
way
in
the
world
lived
a
life
of
dignified
independence
what
was
the
secret
of
these
strong
calm
natures
might
it
not
be
learnt
by
studious
inspection
well
you
look
christian
exclaimed
on
entering
enjoyed
your
provencal
letter
enormously
that
a
ramble
i
have
always
meant
to
do
next
year
perhaps
not
this
have
you
got
into
a
dangerous
habit
of
postponement
i
afraid
i
have
but
no
news
of
peak
i
suppose
earwaker
related
the
story
he
had
heard
from
malkin
adding
must
remember
that
they
met
only
once
in
london
malkin
might
very
well
mistake
another
man
for
peak
replied
the
other
musingly
it
is
impossible
that
peak
has
gone
over
there
if
so
what
on
earth
can
he
be
up
to
why
he
hide
from
his
friends
la
said
the
journalist
with
a
smile
can
devise
no
other
explanation
i
ca
see
that
it
would
be
an
explanation
at
all
grant
even
something
unavowable
you
know
are
we
puritans
how
could
it
harm
him
at
all
events
to
let
us
know
his
whereabouts
no
such
mystery
ever
came
into
my
experience
it
is
too
bad
of
peak
confoundedly
unkind
he
has
found
it
necessary
to
assume
a
character
wholly
fictitious
or
let
us
say
quite
inconsistent
with
his
life
and
opinions
as
known
to
us
this
was
a
fruitful
suggestion
long
in
earwaker
mind
but
not
hitherto
communicated
christian
did
not
at
once
grasp
its
significance
could
that
be
necessary
peak
is
no
swindler
you
do
imply
that
he
is
engaged
in
some
fraud
in
the
ordinary
sense
decidedly
but
picture
some
girl
or
woman
of
conventional
opinions
and
surroundings
what
if
he
resolved
to
win
such
a
wife
at
the
expense
of
disguising
his
true
self
what
an
extraordinary
idea
cried
moxey
peak
is
all
but
a
the
journalist
uttered
croaking
laughter
i
totally
misunderstood
him
asked
christian
confused
and
abashed
think
it
not
impossible
amaze
me
but
no
no
you
are
wrong
earwaker
wrong
in
your
suggestion
i
mean
peak
could
never
sink
to
that
he
is
too
uncompromising
it
will
be
explained
some
day
i
suppose
and
with
a
shrug
of
impatience
the
journalist
turned
to
another
subject
he
too
regretted
his
old
friend
disappearance
and
in
a
measure
resented
it
godwin
peak
was
not
a
man
to
slip
out
of
life
and
leave
no
appreciable
vacancy
neither
of
these
men
admired
him
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
yet
had
his
voice
sounded
at
the
door
both
would
have
sprung
up
with
eager
welcome
he
was
a
force
and
how
many
such
beings
does
one
encounter
in
a
lifetime
chapter
ii
in
different
ways
christian
and
marcella
moxey
had
both
been
lonely
since
their
childhood
as
a
schoolgirl
marcella
seemed
to
her
companions
conceited
and
repellent
only
as
the
result
of
reflection
in
after
years
did
sylvia
moorhouse
express
so
favourable
an
opinion
of
her
in
all
things
she
affected
singularity
especially
it
was
her
delight
to
utter
democratic
and
revolutionary
sentiments
among
hearers
who
belonging
to
a
rigidly
conservative
order
held
such
opinions
impious
arrived
at
womanhood
she
affected
scorn
of
the
beliefs
and
habits
cherished
by
her
own
sex
and
shrank
from
association
with
the
other
godwin
peak
was
the
first
man
with
whom
she
conversed
in
the
tone
of
friendship
and
it
took
a
year
or
more
before
that
point
was
reached
as
her
intimacy
with
him
established
itself
she
was
observed
to
undergo
changes
which
seemed
very
significant
in
the
eyes
of
her
few
acquaintances
disregard
of
costume
had
been
one
of
her
characteristics
but
now
she
moved
gradually
towards
the
opposite
extreme
till
her
dresses
were
occasionally
more
noticeable
for
richness
than
for
good
taste
christian
for
kindred
reasons
was
equally
debarred
from
the
pleasures
and
profits
of
society
at
school
his
teachers
considered
him
clever
his
fellows
for
the
most
part
looked
down
upon
him
as
a
sentimental
weakling
the
death
of
his
parents
when
he
was
still
a
lad
left
him
to
the
indifferent
care
of
a
guardian
nothing
akin
to
him
he
began
life
in
an
uncongenial
position
and
had
not
courage
to
oppose
the
drift
of
circumstances
the
romantic
attachment
which
absorbed
his
best
years
naturally
had
a
debilitating
effect
for
love
was
never
yet
a
supporter
of
the
strenuous
virtues
save
when
it
has
survived
fruition
and
been
blessed
by
reason
in
most
men
a
fit
of
amorous
mooning
works
its
own
cure
energetic
rebound
is
soon
inevitable
but
christian
was
so
constituted
that
a
decade
of
years
could
not
exhaust
his
capacity
for
sentimental
languishment
he
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
seek
no
female
companionship
which
could
imperil
his
faith
unfortunately
this
avoidance
of
the
society
which
would
soon
have
made
him
a
happy
renegade
was
but
too
easy
marcella
and
he
practically
encouraged
each
other
in
a
life
of
isolation
though
to
both
of
them
such
an
existence
was
anything
but
congenial
their
difficulties
were
of
the
same
nature
as
those
which
had
always
beset
godwin
peak
they
had
no
relatives
with
whom
they
cared
to
associate
and
none
of
the
domestic
friends
who
in
the
progress
of
time
establish
and
extend
a
sphere
of
genuine
intimacy
most
people
who
are
capable
of
independent
thought
rapidly
outgrow
the
stage
when
compromise
is
abhorred
they
accept
at
first
reluctantly
but
ere
long
with
satisfaction
that
code
of
polite
intercourse
which
as
steele
says
is
expedient
to
make
fools
and
wise
men
equal
it
was
marcella
that
she
could
neither
learn
tolerance
nor
persuade
herself
to
affect
it
the
emancipated
woman
has
fewer
opportunities
of
relieving
her
mind
than
a
man
in
corresponding
position
if
her
temper
be
aggressive
she
must
renounce
general
society
and
if
not
content
to
live
alone
ally
herself
with
some
group
of
declared
militants
by
correspondence
or
otherwise
marcella
might
have
brought
herself
into
connection
with
women
of
a
sympathetic
type
but
this
effort
she
had
never
made
and
chiefly
because
of
her
acquaintance
with
godwin
peak
in
him
she
concentrated
her
interests
he
was
the
man
to
whom
her
heart
went
forth
with
every
kind
of
fervour
so
long
as
there
remained
a
hope
of
moving
him
to
reciprocal
feeling
she
did
not
care
to
go
in
search
of
female
companions
year
after
year
she
sustained
herself
in
solitude
by
this
faint
hope
she
had
lost
sight
of
the
two
or
three
schoolfellows
who
though
not
so
zealous
as
herself
would
have
welcomed
her
as
an
interesting
acquaintance
and
the
only
woman
who
assiduously
sought
her
was
morton
the
wife
of
one
of
christian
friends
a
but
silly
person
bent
on
making
known
that
she
followed
the
law
godwin
disappearance
sank
her
in
profound
melancholy
through
the
black
weeks
of
january
and
february
she
scarcely
left
the
house
and
on
the
plea
of
illness
refused
to
see
any
one
but
her
brother
between
christian
and
her
there
was
no
avowed
confidence
but
each
knew
the
other
secret
their
mutual
affection
never
spoke
itself
in
words
yet
none
the
less
it
was
indispensable
to
their
lives
deprived
of
his
sister
company
christian
must
have
yielded
to
the
vice
which
had
already
too
strong
a
hold
upon
him
and
have
become
a
maudlin
drunkard
left
to
herself
marcella
had
but
slender
support
against
a
grim
temptation
already
beckoning
her
in
nights
of
sleeplessness
of
the
two
her
nature
was
the
more
tragic
circumstances
aiding
christian
might
still
forget
his
melancholy
abandon
the
whisky
bottle
and
pass
a
lifetime
of
amiable
uxoriousness
varied
with
scientific
enthusiasm
but
for
marcella
frustrate
in
the
desire
with
which
every
impulse
of
her
being
had
identified
itself
what
future
could
be
imagined
when
a
day
or
two
of
sunlight
the
rays
through
a
atmosphere
which
london
has
to
accept
with
gratitude
had
announced
that
the
winter
was
overcome
and
when
the
newspapers
began
to
speak
after
their
fashion
of
pictures
awaiting
scrutiny
christian
exerted
himself
to
rouse
his
sister
from
her
growing
indolence
he
succeeded
in
taking
her
to
the
academy
among
the
works
of
sculpture
set
apart
for
the
indifference
of
the
public
was
a
female
head
catalogued
as
nihilist
in
itself
interesting
and
specially
so
to
marcella
because
it
was
executed
by
an
artist
whose
name
she
recognised
as
that
of
a
schoolmate
agatha
walworth
she
spoke
of
the
circumstance
to
christian
and
added
should
like
to
have
that
let
us
go
and
see
the
price
the
work
was
already
sold
christian
happy
that
his
sister
could
be
aroused
to
this
interest
suggested
that
a
cast
might
be
obtainable
to
miss
walworth
he
urged
yourself
to
her
i
should
think
she
must
be
the
right
kind
of
woman
though
at
the
time
she
shook
her
head
marcella
was
presently
tempted
to
address
a
letter
to
the
artist
who
responded
with
friendly
invitation
in
this
way
a
new
house
was
opened
to
her
but
simultaneously
one
more
illusion
was
destroyed
knowing
little
of
life
and
much
of
literature
she
pictured
miss
walworth
as
inhabiting
a
delightful
bohemian
world
where
the
rules
of
conventionalism
had
no
existence
and
everything
was
judged
by
the
modern
french
biographies
supplied
all
her
ideas
of
studio
society
she
prepared
herself
for
the
first
visit
with
a
joyous
tremor
wondering
whether
she
would
be
deemed
worthy
to
associate
with
the
men
and
women
who
lived
for
art
the
reality
was
a
shock
in
a
large
house
at
chiswick
she
found
a
gathering
of
most
respectable
english
people
chatting
over
the
regulation
not
one
of
them
inclined
to
disregard
the
dictates
of
grundy
in
dress
demeanour
or
dialogue
agatha
walworth
lived
with
her
parents
and
her
sisters
like
any
other
irreproachable
young
woman
she
had
a
nice
little
studio
and
worked
at
modelling
with
a
good
deal
of
aptitude
but
of
bohemia
she
knew
nothing
whatever
save
by
hearsay
her
was
no
indication
of
a
rebellious
spirit
some
friend
had
happened
to
suggest
that
a
certain
female
model
a
russian
would
do
very
well
for
such
a
character
and
the
hint
was
tolerably
well
carried
out
nothing
more
marcella
returned
in
a
mood
of
contemptuous
disappointment
the
cast
she
had
desired
to
have
was
shortly
sent
to
her
as
a
gift
but
she
could
take
no
pleasure
in
it
still
she
saw
more
of
the
walworths
and
found
them
not
illiberal
agatha
was
intelligent
and
fairly
well
read
in
modern
authors
no
need
to
conceal
one
opinions
in
conversation
with
her
marcella
happened
to
be
spending
the
evening
with
these
acquaintances
whilst
her
brother
was
having
his
chat
at
staple
inn
on
her
return
she
mentioned
to
christian
that
she
had
been
invited
to
visit
the
walworths
in
devonshire
a
few
weeks
hence
by
all
means
urged
her
brother
do
think
i
shall
they
are
too
respectable
they
seem
very
you
really
ca
expect
absolute
unconventionality
is
it
desirable
really
is
it
now
suppose
i
were
to
marry
some
day
marcella
do
you
think
my
household
would
be
unconventional
his
voice
shook
a
little
and
he
kept
his
eyes
averted
marcella
to
whom
her
brother
romance
was
anything
but
an
agreeable
subject
the
slight
acquaintance
she
had
with
the
modern
laura
did
not
encourage
her
to
hope
for
that
lady
widowhood
gave
no
heed
to
the
question
are
going
to
have
a
house
at
budleigh
salterton
do
you
know
of
the
place
somewhere
near
the
mouth
of
the

miss
walworth
tells
me
that
one
of
our
old
school
friends
is
living
there

ever
mention
sylvia
she
had
gleams
of
sense
i
remember
but
no
doubt
society
has
drilled
all
that
out
of
her
christian
sighed
he
urged
is
getting
more
tolerant
than
you
are
disposed
to
think
very
few
people
would
nowadays
object
to
an
acquaintance
on
speculative
grounds
some
one
who
was
it
was
telling
me
of
a
recent
marriage
between
the
daughter
of
some
church
people
and
a
man
who
made
no
secret
of
his
agnosticism
the
parents
acquiescing
cheerfully
the
one
thing
still
insisted
on
is
decency
of
behaviour
marcella
eyes
flashed
can
you
say
that
you
know
quite
well
that
most
kinds
of
immorality
are
far
more
readily
forgiven
by
people
of
the
world
than
sincere
heterodoxy
on
moral
subjects
well
i
meant
decency
from
point
of
view
and
there
really
must
be
such
restrictions
you
know
how
very
few
people
are
capable
of
what
you
call
sincere
heterodoxy
in
morals
or
religion
your
position
is
unphilosophical
indeed
it
is
take
the
world
as
you
find
it
and
make
friends
with
kind
worthy
people
you
have
suffered
from
a
needless
isolation
do
accept
this
opportunity
of
adding
to
your
acquaintances
do
marcella
i
shall
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
dear
girl
his
sister
let
her
head
lie
back
against
the
chair
her
face
averted
a
stranger
seated
in
christian
place
regarding
marcella
whilst
her
features
were
thus
hidden
would
have
thought
it
probable
that
she
was
a
woman
of
no
little
beauty
her
masses
of
tawny
hair
her
arms
and
hands
the
pose
and
outline
of
her
figure
certainly
suggested
a
countenance
of
corresponding
charm
and
the
ornate
richness
of
her
attire
aided
such
an
impression
this
thought
came
to
christian
as
he
gazed
at
her
his
eyes
always
so
gentle
softened
to
a
tender
compassion
as
the
silence
continued
he
looked
uneasily
about
him
when
at
length
he
spoke
it
was
as
though
a
matter
of
trifling
moment
had
occurred
to
him
i
am
told
that
malkin
earwaker
friend
you
know
saw
peak
not
long
ago
in
america
marcella
did
not
change
her
position
but
at
the
sound
of
peak
name
she
stirred
as
if
with
an
intention
at
once
checked
of
bending
eagerly
forward
america
she
asked
incredulously
boston
he
met
him
in
the
street
or
thinks
he
did
there
a
doubt
when
malkin
spoke
to
the
man
he
declared
that
he
was
not
peak
at
all
said
there
was
a
mistake
marcella
moved
so
as
to
show
her
face
endeavouring
to
express
an
unemotional
interest
she
looked
coldly
scornful
ridiculous
man
ca
be
depended
upon
she
said
there
had
been
one
meeting
between
marcella
and
malkin
with
the
result
that
each
thoroughly
disliked
the
other
an
antipathy
which
could
have
been
foreseen
there
no
saying
replied
christian
of
one
thing
i
feel
pretty
sure
we
have
seen
the
last
of
peak
he
never
come
back
to
us
not
can
only
say
that
i
feel
convinced
he
has
broken
finally
with
all
his
old
we
must
think
no
more
of
him
marcella
his
sister
rose
slowly
affected
to
glance
at
a
book
and
in
a
few
moments
said
for
another
hour
christian
sat
by
himself
in
gloomy
thought
at
breakfast
next
morning
marcella
announced
that
she
would
be
from
home
the
whole
day
she
might
return
in
time
for
dinner
but
it
was
uncertain
her
brother
asked
no
questions
but
said
that
he
would
lunch
in
town
about
ten
a
cab
was
summoned
and
marcella
without
drove
away
christian
lingered
as
long
as
possible
over
the
morning
paper
unable
to
determine
how
he
should
waste
the
weary
hours
that
lay
before
him
there
was
no
reason
for
his
remaining
in
london
through
this
brief
season
of
summer
glow
means
and
leisure
were
his
he
could
go
whither
he
would
but
the
effort
of
decision
and
departure
seemed
too
much
for
him
worst
of
all
this
lassitude
not
for
the
first
time
was
affecting
his
imagination
he
thought
with
a
dull
discontent
of
the
ideal
love
to
which
he
had
bound
himself
could
he
but
escape
from
it
and
begin
a
new
life
but
he
was
the
slave
of
his
airy
obligation
for
very
shame
sake
his
ten
years
consistency
must
be
that
of
a
lifetime
there
was
but
one
place
away
from
london
to
which
he
felt
himself
drawn
and
that
was
the
one
place
he
might
not
visit
this
sunshine
carried
him
back
to
that
day
when
he
had
lain
in
the
meadow
near
twybridge
and
talked
with
godwin
peak
how
distinctly
he
remembered
his
mood
practical
do
be
led
astray
after
ideals
concentrate
yourself
yes
it
was
he
who
had
given
that
advice
to
peak
and
had
he
but
recked
his
own
rede
poor
little
janet
was
she
married
if
so
her
husband
must
be
a
happy
man
why
should
he
not
go
down
to
twybridge
his
uncle
undoubtedly
still
living
must
by
this
time
have
forgotten
the
old
resentment
perhaps
would
be
glad
to
see
him
in
any
case
he
might
stroll
about
the
town
and
somehow
obtain
news
of
the
moxey
family
with
vague
he
left
the
house
and
walked
westward
the
stream
of
traffic
in
edgware
road
brought
him
to
a
pause
he
stood
for
five
minutes
in
miserable
indecision
all
but
resolving
to
go
on
as
far
as
euston
and
look
for
the
next
northward
train
but
the
vice
in
his
will
prevailed
he
turned
in
another
direction
and
presently
came
out
into
sussex
square
here
was
the
house
to
which
his
thoughts
had
perpetually
gone
forth
ever
since
that
day
when
constance
gave
her
hand
to
a
thriving
city
man
and
became
palmer
at
present
he
knew
it
was
inhabited
only
by
domestics
palmer
recovering
from
illness
that
threatened
to
be
fatal
had
gone
to
bournemouth
where
constance
of
course
tended
him
but
he
would
walk
past
and
look
up
at
the
windows
all
the
blinds
were
down
naturally
thrice
he
went
by
and
retraced
his
steps
then
still
he
approached
the
door
rang
the
bell
the
appearance
of
the
servant
choked
his
voice
for
an
instant
but
he
succeeded
in
shaping
an
inquiry
after
palmer
health
sorry
to
say
sir
was
the
reply
palmer
died
last
night
we
received
the
news
only
an
hour
or
two
ago
christian
tottered
on
his
feet
and
turned
so
pale
that
the
servant
regarded
him
with
anxiety
for
a
minute
or
two
he
stared
vacantly
into
the
gloomy
hall
then
without
a
word
he
turned
abruptly
and
walked
away
unconscious
of
the
intervening
distance
he
found
himself
at
home
in
his
library
the
was
asking
him
whether
he
would
have
luncheon
scarcely
understanding
the
question
he
muttered
a
refusal
and
sat
down
so
it
had
come
at
last
constance
was
a
widow
in
a
year
or
so
she
might
think
of
marrying
again
he
remained
in
the
library
for
three
or
four
hours
at
first
incapable
of
rejoicing
then
ashamed
to
do
so
he
at
length
suffered
from
such
a
throbbing
of
the
heart
that
apprehension
of
illness
recalled
him
to
a
normal
state
of
mind
the
favourite
decanter
was
within
reach
and
it
gave
him
the
wonted
support
then
at
length
did
heart
and
brain
glow
with
exulting
fervour
poor
constance
noble
woman
most
patient
of
martyrs
the
hour
of
her
redemption
had
struck
the
fetters
had
fallen
from
her
tender
suffering
body
of
she
could
not
yet
think
he
did
not
wish
it
the
womanhood
must
pay
its
debt
to
nature
before
she
could
gladden
in
the
prospect
of
a
new
life
months
must
go
by
before
he
could
approach
her
or
even
remind
her
of
his
existence
but
at
last
his
reward
was
sure
and
he
had
thought
of
twybridge
of
his
cousin
janet
o
unworthy
lapse
he
shed
tears
of
tenderness
dear
noble
constance
it
was
now
nearly
twelve
years
since
he
first
looked
upon
her
face
in
those
days
he
mingled
freely
with
all
the
society
within
his
reach
it
was
not
very
select
and
constance
markham
shone
to
him
like
a
divinity
among
creatures
of
indifferent
clay
they
said
she
was
coquettish
that
she
played
at
the
game
of
love
with
every
presentable
young
man
envious
calumny
no
she
was
inexperienced
a
lovely
and
joyous
girl
of
not
yet
twenty
it
is
so
difficult
for
such
a
girl
to
understand
her
own
emotions
her
parents
persuaded
her
into
wedding
palmer
that
was
all
gone
into
the
past
and
now
his
concern
their
concern
was
only
with
the
blessed
future
at
three
he
began
to
feel
a
healthy
appetite
he
sent
for
a
cab
and
drove
towards
the
region
of
restaurants
had
he
yielded
to
the
impulse
which
this
morning
directed
him
to
twybridge
he
would
have
arrived
in
that
town
not
very
long
after
his
sister
for
that
was
the
aim
of
marcella
journey
on
reaching
the
station
she
dropped
a
light
veil
over
her
face
and
set
forth
on
foot
to
discover
the
abode
of
mrs
peak
no
inhabitant
of
twybridge
save
her
uncle
and
his
daughters
could
possibly
recognise
her
but
she
shrank
from
walking
through
the
streets
with
exposed
countenance
whether
she
would
succeed
in
her
quest
was
uncertain
godwin
peak
mother
still
dwelt
here
she
knew
for
less
than
a
year
ago
she
had
asked
the
question
of
godwin
himself
but
a
woman
in
humble
circumstances
might
not
have
a
house
of
her
own
and
her
name
was
probably
unknown
save
to
a
few
friends
however
the
first
natural
step
was
to
inquire
for
a
directory
a
stationer
supplied
her
with
one
informing
her
with
pride
that
he
himself
was
the
author
of
it
that
this
was
only
the
second
year
of
its
issue
and
that
its
success
was
encouraging
retiring
to
a
quiet
street
marcella
examined
her
purchase
and
came
upon
oliver
seedsman
the
sole
entry
of
the
name
this
was
probably
a
relative
of
godwin
without
difficulty
she
found
mr
peak
shop
behind
the
counter
stood
oliver
himself
rubbing
his
hands
was
there
indeed
a
family
likeness
between
this
young
shopkeeper
and
the
stern
ambitious
intellectual
man
whose
lineaments
were
ever
before
her
mind
though
with
fear
and
repulsion
marcella
was
constrained
to
recognise
something
in
the
commonplace
visage
with
an
uncertain
voice
she
made
known
her
business
wish
to
find
mrs
peak
a
widow
an
elderly
lady
yes
madam
my
mother
no
doubt
she
lives
with
her
sister
miss
cadman
the
milliner
shop
in
the
first
street
to
the
left
let
me
point
it
out
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
marcella
murmured
thanks
and
walked
away
she
found
the
milliner
shop
and
went
past
it
why
should
discoveries
such
as
these
be
so
distasteful
to
her
her
own
origin
was
not
so
exalted
that
she
must
needs
look
down
on
still
for
the
moment
she
all
but
abandoned
her
undertaking
was
godwin
peak
in
truth
of
so
much
account
to
her
would
not
the
shock
of
meeting
his
mother
be
final
having
come
thus
far
she
must
go
through
with
it
if
the
experience
cured
her
of
a
hopeless
passion
why
what
more
desirable
she
entered
the
shop
a
young
female
assistant
came
forward
with
respectful
smile
and
waited
her
commands
wish
if
you
please
to
see
mrs
peak
yes
madam
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
walk
this
way
too
late
marcella
remembered
that
she
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
the
girl
led
her
out
of
the
shop
into
a
dark
passage
and
thence
into
a
which
smelt
of
lavender
here
she
waited
for
a
few
moments
then
the
door
opened
softly
and
mrs
peak
presented
herself
there
was
no
shock
the
widow
had
the
air
of
a
gentlewoman
walked
with
elderly
grace
and
spoke
with
propriety
she
resembled
godwin
and
this
time
it
was
not
painful
to
remark
the
likeness
have
come
to
twybridge
began
marcella
gently
and
respectfully
is
to
say
i
have
stopped
in
passing
to
ask
for
the
address
of
godwin
peak
a
letter
has
failed
to
reach
him
it
was
her
wish
to
manage
without
either
disclosing
the
truth
about
herself
or
elaborating
fictions
but
after
the
first
words
she
felt
it
impossible
not
to
offer
some
explanation
mrs
peak
showed
a
slight
surprise
with
the
courage
of
cowardice
marcella
continued
more
rapidly
name
is
ward
my
husband
used
to
know
mr
peak
in
london
a
few
years
ago
but
we
have
been
abroad
and
unfortunately
have
lost
sight
of
him
we
remembered
that
mr
peak
relatives
lived
at
twybridge
and
as
we
wish
very
much
to
renew
the
old
acquaintance
i
took
the
opportunity
passing
by
rail
i
made
inquiries
in
the
town
and
was
directed
to
you
i
hope
rightly
the
widow
face
changed
to
satisfaction
evidently
her
straightforward
mind
accepted
the
story
as
perfectly
credible
marcella
with
bitterness
knew
herself
far
from
comely
enough
to
suggest
perils
she
looked
old
enough
for
the
part
she
was
playing
and
the
glove
upon
her
hand
might
conceal
a
you
were
directed
rightly
mrs
peak
made
quiet
answer
shall
be
very
glad
to
give
you
my
son
address
he
left
london
about
last
christmas
and
went
to
live
at
exeter
we
thought
he
might
be
out
of
england
he
has
lived
all
the
time
at
exeter
the
address
is
longbrook
street
she
added
the
number
is
studying
and
finds
that
part
of
the
country
pleasant
i
am
hoping
to
see
him
here
before
very
long
marcella
did
not
extend
the
conversation
she
spoke
of
having
to
catch
a
train
and
veiled
as
well
as
she
could
beneath
ordinary
courtesies
her
perplexity
at
the
information
she
had
received
when
she
again
reached
the
house
at
notting
hill
christian
was
absent
he
came
home
about
nine
in
the
evening
it
was
impossible
not
to
remark
his
strange
mood
of
repressed
excitement
but
marcella
did
not
question
him
and
christian
had
resolved
to
conceal
the
day
event
until
he
could
speak
of
it
without
agitation
before
they
parted
for
the
night
marcella
said
carelessly
have
decided
to
go
down
to
budleigh
salterton
when
the
time
comes
right
exclaimed
her
brother
with
satisfaction
do
better
could
possibly
it
will
be
a
very
good
thing
for
you
in
several
ways
and
each
withdrew
to
brood
over
a
perturbing
secret
chapter
iii
three
or
four
years
ago
when
already
he
had
conceived
the
idea
of
trying
his
fortune
in
some
provincial
town
peak
persuaded
himself
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
make
acquaintances
among
educated
people
even
though
he
had
no
credentials
to
offer
he
indulged
his
fancy
and
pictured
all
manner
of
pleasant
accidents
which
surely
sooner
or
later
must
bring
him
into
contact
with
families
of
the
better
sort
one
does
hear
of
such
occurrences
no
doubt
in
every
town
there
is
some
one
or
other
whom
a
stranger
may
approach
a
medical
man
a
local
antiquary
a
librarian
a
philanthropist
and
with
moderate
advantages
of
mind
and
address
such
casual
connections
may
at
times
be
the
preface
to
intimacy
with
all
resulting
benefits
but
experience
of
exeter
had
taught
him
how
slight
would
have
been
his
chance
of
getting
on
friendly
terms
with
any
mortal
if
he
had
depended
solely
on
his
personal
qualities
after
a
nine
months
residence
and
with
the
friendship
of
such
people
as
the
warricombes
he
was
daily
oppressed
by
his
isolation
amid
this
community
of
english
folk
he
had
done
his
utmost
to
adopt
the
tone
of
average
polished
life
he
had
sat
at
the
tables
of
worthy
men
and
conversed
freely
with
their
sons
and
daughters
he
exchanged
greetings
in
the
highways
but
this
availed
him
nothing
now
as
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
he
was
an
alien
a
lodger
what
else
had
he
ever
been
since
boyhood
a
lodger
in
kingsmill
a
lodger
in
london
a
lodger
in
exeter
nay
even
as
a
boy
he
could
scarcely
have
been
said
to
at
home
for
from
the
dawn
of
conscious
intelligence
he
felt
himself
out
of
place
among
familiar
things
and
people
at
issue
with
prevalent
opinions
was
he
never
to
win
a
right
of
citizenship
never
to
have
a
recognised
place
among
men
associated
in
the
duties
and
pleasures
of
life
sunday
was
always
a
day
of
weariness
and
despondency
and
at
present
he
suffered
from
the
excitement
of
his
conversation
with
sidwell
followed
as
it
had
been
by
a
night
of
fever
extravagant
hope
had
given
place
to
a
depression
which
could
see
nothing
beyond
the
immediate
gloom
until
he
lay
in
bed
after
dinner
finding
the
solitude
of
his
little
room
intolerable
he
went
out
to
walk
in
the
streets
not
far
from
his
door
some
children
had
gathered
in
a
quiet
corner
and
were
playing
at
a
game
on
the
pavement
with
pieces
of
chalk
as
he
drew
near
a
policeman
observing
the
little
group
called
out
to
them
in
a
stern
voice
then
what
are
you
doing
there
do
you
know
it
is
the
youngsters
fled
conscious
of
shameful
delinquency
there
it
was
there
spoke
the
civic
voice
the
social
rule
the
public
sentiment
godwin
felt
that
the
policeman
had
rebuked
and
in
doing
so
had
severely
indicated
the
cause
of
that
isolation
which
he
was
condemned
to
suffer
yes
all
his
life
he
had
desired
to
play
games
on
sunday
he
had
never
been
able
to
understand
why
games
on
sunday
should
be
forbidden
and
the
angry
laugh
which
escaped
him
as
he
went
by
the
guardian
of
public
morals
declared
the
impossibility
of
his
ever
being
at
one
with
communities
which
made
this
point
the
prime
test
of
worthiness
he
walked
on
at
a
great
speed
chafing
talking
to
himself
his
way
took
him
through
heavitree
when
hooker
saw
the
light
here
how
easy
to
believe
that
the
anglican
church
was
the
noblest
outcome
of
human
progress
and
on
and
on
until
by
a
lane
with
red
banks
of
sandstone
thick
with
ferns
shadowed
with
noble
boughs
he
came
to
a
hamlet
which
had
always
been
one
of
his
favourite
resorts
so
peacefully
it
lay
amid
the
exquisite
rural
landscape
the
cottages
were
all
closed
and
silent
hark
for
the
reason
from
the
old
church
sounded
an
organ
prelude
then
the
voice
of
the
congregation
joining
in
one
of
the
familiar
hymns
a
significant
feature
of
godwin
idiosyncrasy
notwithstanding
his
profound
hatred
and
contempt
of
multitudes
he
could
never
hear
the
union
of
many
voices
in
song
but
his
breast
heaved
and
a
choking
warmth
rose
in
his
throat
even
where
prejudice
wrought
most
strongly
with
him
it
had
to
give
way
before
this
rush
of
emotion
he
often
hurried
out
of
earshot
when
a
group
of
salvationists
were
singing
lest
the
involuntary
sympathy
of
his
senses
should
agitate
and
enrage
him
at
present
he
had
no
wish
to
draw
away
he
entered
the
churchyard
and
found
the
leafy
nook
with
a
tombstone
where
he
had
often
rested
and
as
he
listened
to
the
rude
chanting
of
verse
after
verse
tears
fell
upon
his
cheeks
this
sensibility
was
quite
distinct
from
religious
feeling
if
the
note
of
devotion
sounding
in
that
simple
strain
had
any
effect
upon
him
at
all
it
merely
intensified
his
consciousness
of
pathos
as
he
thought
of
the
many
generations
that
had
worshipped
here
living
and
dying
in
a
faith
which
was
at
best
a
helpful
delusion
he
could
appreciate
the
beautiful
aspects
of
christianity
as
a
legend
its
nobility
as
a
humanising
power
its
rich
results
in
literature
its
grandeur
in
historic
retrospect
but
at
no
moment
in
his
life
had
he
felt
it
as
a
spiritual
influence
so
far
from
tending
in
that
direction
as
he
sat
and
brooded
here
in
the
churchyard
he
owed
to
his
fit
of
tearfulness
a
courage
which
determined
him
to
abandon
all
religious
pretences
and
henceforth
trust
only
to
what
was
sincere
in
him
his
human
passion
the
future
he
had
sketched
to
sidwell
was
impossible
the
rural
pastorate
the
life
of
moral
endeavour
which
in
his
excitement
had
seemed
so
nearly
a
genuine
aspiration
that
it
might
perchance
become
reality
dreams
dreams
he
must
woo
as
a
man
and
trust
to
fortune
for
his
escape
from
a
false
position
sidwell
should
hear
nothing
more
of
clerical
projects
he
was
by
this
time
convinced
that
she
held
far
less
tenaciously
than
he
had
supposed
to
the
special
doctrines
of
the
church
and
if
he
had
not
deceived
himself
in
interpreting
her
behaviour
a
mutual
avowal
of
love
would
involve
ready
consent
on
her
part
to
his
abandoning
a
career
which
as
he
would
represent
it
had
been
adopted
under
a
mistaken
impulse
he
returned
to
the
point
which
he
had
reached
when
he
set
forth
with
the
intention
of
bidding
to
the
warricombes
except
that
in
flinging
away
hypocrisy
he
no
longer
needed
to
trample
his
desires
the
change
need
not
be
declared
till
after
a
lapse
of
time
for
the
present
his
task
was
to
obtain
one
more
private
interview
with
sidwell
ere
she
went
to
london
or
if
that
could
not
be
somehow
to
address
her
in
unmistakable
language
the
fumes
were
dispelled
from
his
brain
and
as
he
walked
homeward
he
plotted
and
planned
with
hopeful
energy
sylvia
moorhouse
came
into
his
mind
could
he
not
in
some
way
make
use
of
her
he
had
never
yet
been
to
see
her
at
budleigh
salterton
that
he
would
do
forthwith
and
perchance
the
visit
might
supply
him
with
suggestions
on
the
morrow
he
set
forth
going
by
train
to
exmouth
and
thence
by
the
coach
which
runs
twice
a
day
to
the
little
seaside
town
the
delightful
drive
up
hill
and
down
dale
with
its
magnificent
views
over
the
estuary
and
its
wayside
beauties
put
him
into
the
best
of
spirits
about
noon
he
alighted
at
the
rolle
arms
the
hotel
to
which
the
coach
conducts
its
passengers
and
entered
to
take
a
meal
he
would
call
upon
the
moorhouses
at
the
conventional
hour
the
intervening
time
was
spent
pleasantly
enough
in
loitering
about
the
pebbled
beach
a
breeze
which
had
begun
to
gather
clouds
drove
on
the
rising
tide
by
four
there
was
an
end
of
sunshine
and
spurts
of
rain
mingled
with
flying
foam
peak
turned
inland
pursued
the
leafy
street
up
the
valley
and
came
to
the
house
where
his
friends
dwelt
in
crossing
the
garden
he
caught
sight
of
a
lady
who
sat
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
her
back
was
turned
to
the
window
and
before
he
could
draw
near
enough
to
see
her
better
she
had
moved
away
but
the
glimpse
he
had
obtained
of
her
head
and
shoulders
affected
him
with
so
distinct
an
alarm
that
his
steps
were
checked
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
recognised
the
figure
and
if
he
were
but
the
supposition
was
ridiculous
at
all
events
so
vastly
improbable
that
he
would
not
entertain
it
and
now
he
descried
another
face
that
of
miss
moorhouse
herself
and
it
gave
him
a
reassuring
smile
he
rang
the
door
bell
how
happy
he
said
to
himself
those
men
who
go
to
call
upon
their
friends
without
a
tremor
even
if
he
had
not
received
that
shock
a
moment
ago
he
would
still
have
needed
to
struggle
against
the
treacherous
beating
of
his
heart
as
he
waited
for
admission
it
was
always
so
when
he
visited
the
warricombes
or
any
other
family
in
exeter
not
merely
in
consequence
of
the
dishonest
part
he
was
playing
but
because
he
had
not
quite
overcome
the
nervousness
which
so
anguished
him
in
earlier
days
the
first
moment
after
his
entering
a
cost
him
pangs
of
complex
origin
his
eyes
fell
first
of
all
upon
moorhouse
who
advanced
to
welcome
him
he
was
aware
of
three
other
persons
in
the
room
the
nearest
he
could
perceive
without
regarding
her
was
sidwell
friend
the
other
two
on
whom
he
did
not
yet
venture
to
cast
a
glance
sat
or
rather
had
just
risen
in
a
dim
background
as
he
shook
hands
with
sylvia
they
drew
nearer
one
of
them
was
a
man
and
as
his
voice
at
once
declared
no
other
than
buckland
warricombe
peak
returned
his
greeting
and
in
the
same
moment
gazed
at
the
last
of
the
party
moorhouse
was
speaking
peak
miss
moxey
a
compression
of
the
lips
was
the
only
sign
of
disturbance
that
anyone
could
have
perceived
on
godwin
countenance
already
he
had
strung
himself
against
his
wonted
agitation
and
the
added
trial
did
not
sensibly
enhance
what
he
suffered
in
discovering
that
he
had
rightly
identified
the
figure
at
the
window
he
experienced
no
renewal
of
the
dread
which
brought
him
to
a
already
half
prepared
for
this
stroke
of
fate
he
felt
a
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
meet
it
so
steadily
tumult
of
thought
was
his
only
trouble
it
seemed
as
if
his
brain
must
burst
with
the
stress
of
its
lightning
operations
in
three
seconds
he
the
past
made
several
distinct
anticipations
of
the
future
and
still
discussed
with
himself
how
he
should
behave
this
moment
he
noted
that
marcella
face
was
bloodless
that
her
attempt
to
smile
resulted
in
a
very
painful
distortion
of
brow
and
lips
and
he
had
leisure
to
pity
her
this
emotion
prevailed
with
a
sense
of
magnanimity
which
afterwards
excited
his
wonder
he
pressed
the
cold
hand
and
said
in
a
cheerful
tone
introduction
took
place
long
ago
if
i
not
mistaken
i
had
no
idea
miss
moxey
that
you
were
among
moorhouse
friends
i
that
you
were
mr
peak
came
the
answer
in
a
steadier
voice
than
godwin
had
expected
moorhouse
and
her
daughter
made
the
pleasant
exclamations
that
were
called
for
buckland
warricombe
with
a
doubtful
smile
on
his
lips
kept
glancing
from
miss
moxey
to
her
acquaintance
and
back
again
peak
at
length
faced
him
hoped
we
should
meet
down
here
this
autumn
should
have
looked
you
up
in
a
day
or
two
buckland
replied
seating
himself
you
propose
to
stay
in
exeter
through
the
winter
not
quite
sure
but
i
think
it
likely
godwin
turned
to
the
neighbour
of
whose
presence
he
was
most
conscious
hope
your
brother
is
well
miss
moxey
their
eyes
encountered
steadily
he
is
quite
well
thank
you
he
often
says
that
it
seems
very
long
since
he
heard
from
you
a
bad
is
he
also
in
devonshire
in
london
a
storm
we
are
going
to
have
exclaimed
sylvia
looking
to
the
window
predicted
it
yesterday
i
should
like
to
be
on
the
top
of
westdown
beacon
would
you
miss
moxey
am
quite
willing
to
go
with
you
what
pleasure
do
you
look
for
up
there
asked
warricombe
in
a
blunt
tone
there
a
question
cried
sylvia
appealing
to
the
rest
of
the
company
agree
with
warricombe
remarked
her
mother
better
to
be
in
a
comfortable
room
you
radicals
what
a
world
you
will
make
of
it
in
time
sylvia
affected
to
turn
away
in
disgust
and
happening
to
glance
through
the
window
she
saw
two
young
ladies
approaching
from
the
road
walworths
struggling
desperately
with
their
umbrellas
should
wonder
if
you
think
it
unworthy
of
an
artist
to
carry
an
umbrella
said
buckland
you
suggest
it
i
certainly
do
they
should
get
nobly
drenched
she
went
out
into
the
hall
and
soon
returned
with
her
friends
miss
walworth
the
artist
miss
muriel
walworth
and
a
youth
their
brother
in
the
course
of
conversation
peak
learnt
that
miss
moxey
was
the
guest
of
this
family
and
that
she
had
been
at
budleigh
salterton
with
them
only
a
day
or
two
for
the
time
he
listened
and
observed
endeavouring
to
postpone
consideration
of
the
dangers
into
which
he
had
suddenly
fallen
marcella
had
made
herself
his
accomplice
thus
far
in
disguising
the
real
significance
of
their
meeting
and
whether
she
would
betray
him
in
her
subsequent
talk
with
the
moorhouses
remained
a
matter
of
doubt
of
course
he
must
have
assurance
of
her
disposition
but
the
issues
involved
were
too
desperate
for
instant
scrutiny
he
felt
the
gambler
excitement
an
irrational
pleasure
in
the
consciousness
that
his
whole
future
was
at
stake
buckland
warricombe
had
a
keen
eye
upon
him
and
doubtless
was
eager
to
strike
a
train
of
suspicious
circumstances
his
face
at
all
events
should
give
no
sign
of
discomposure
indeed
he
found
so
much
enjoyment
in
the
bright
gossip
of
this
assembly
of
ladies
that
the
smile
he
wore
was
perfectly
natural
the
walworths
he
gathered
were
to
return
to
london
in
a
week
time
this
meant
in
all
probability
that
marcella
stay
here
would
not
be
prolonged
beyond
that
date
perhaps
he
could
find
an
opportunity
of
seeing
her
apart
from
her
friends
in
reply
to
a
question
from
moorhouse
he
made
known
that
he
proposed
staying
at
the
rolle
arms
for
several
days
and
when
he
had
spoken
he
glanced
at
marcella
she
understood
him
he
felt
sure
an
invitation
to
lunch
here
on
the
morrow
was
of
course
accepted
before
leaving
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
buckland
relatives
will
be
going
to
town
very
soon
i
understand
warricombe
nodded
i
see
you
at
exeter
godwin
continued
not
sure
i
shall
go
over
but
it
uncertain
whether
i
shall
still
be
there
when
you
return
the
radical
was
distinctly
less
amicable
than
even
on
the
last
occasion
of
their
meeting
they
shook
hands
in
rather
a
perfunctory
way
early
in
the
evening
there
was
a
temporary
lull
in
the
storm
rain
no
longer
fell
and
in
spaces
of
the
rushing
sky
a
few
stars
showed
themselves
unable
to
rest
at
the
hotel
peak
set
out
for
a
walk
towards
the
cliff
summit
called
westdown
beacon
he
could
see
little
more
than
black
vacancies
but
a
struggle
with
the
wind
suited
his
temper
and
he
enjoyed
the
incessant
roar
of
surf
in
the
darkness
after
an
hour
of
this
buffeting
he
returned
to
the
beach
and
stood
as
close
as
possible
to
the
fierce
breakers
no
person
was
in
sight
but
when
he
began
to
move
towards
the
upper
shore
three
female
figures
detached
themselves
from
the
gloom
and
advanced
in
his
direction
they
came
so
near
that
their
voices
were
audible
and
thereupon
he
stepped
up
to
them
you
going
to
the
beacon
after
all
miss
moorhouse
sylvia
was
accompanied
by
agatha
walworth
and
miss
moxey
she
explained
laughingly
that
they
had
stolen
out
by
agreement
whilst
the
males
of
their
respective
households
still
lingered
at
the
warricombe
was
right
after
all
we
shall
be
blown
to
pieces
a
very
little
of
the
romantic
goes
a
long
way
nowadays
godwin
was
determined
to
draw
marcella
aside
seemingly
she
met
his
wish
for
as
all
turned
to
regain
the
shelter
of
houses
she
fell
behind
her
female
companions
and
stood
close
by
him
want
to
see
you
before
you
go
back
to
london
he
said
bending
his
head
near
to
hers
wrote
a
letter
to
you
this
morning
was
her
reply
letter
to
what
address
address
at
exeter
how
did
you
know
it
explain
afterwards
can
i
see
you
here
it
impossible
i
shall
go
to
exeter
and
there
write
to
you
again
well
you
promise
to
do
this
i
promise
there
was
danger
even
in
the
exchange
of
these
hurried
sentences
miss
walworth
had
glanced
back
and
might
possibly
have
caught
a
phrase
that
aroused
curiosity
having
accompanied
the
girls
to
within
view
of
their
destination
peak
said
and
went
home
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
thought
which
was
sufficiently
absorbing
the
next
day
he
had
no
sight
of
marcella
at
luncheon
the
moorhouses
were
alone
afterwards
godwin
accepted
a
proposal
of
the
mathematician
who
was
generally
invisible
amid
his
formulae
for
a
walk
up
the
otter
valley
naturally
they
talked
of
coleridge
whose
metaphysical
side
appealed
to
moorhouse
peak
dwelt
on
the
human
and
poetical
and
was
led
by
that
peculiar
recklessness
of
mood
which
at
times
relieved
his
nervous
tension
to
defend
opium
eating
as
a
source
of
pleasurable
experience
will
hardly
venture
on
that
paradox
in
the
pulpit
remarked
his
companion
with
laughter
not
but
i
have
heard
arguments
from
that
place
decidedly
more
immoral
doubt
godwin
corrected
the
impression
he
perhaps
had
made
by
turning
with
sudden
seriousness
to
another
subject
the
ironic
temptation
was
terribly
strong
in
him
just
now
one
is
occasionally
possessed
by
a
desire
to
shout
in
the
midst
of
a
silent
assembly
and
impulse
of
the
same
kind
kept
urging
him
to
utter
words
which
would
irretrievably
ruin
his
prospects
the
sense
that
life
is
an
intolerable
mummery
can
with
difficulty
be
controlled
by
certain
minds
even
when
circumstances
offer
no
keen
incitement
to
rebellion
but
peak
position
demanded
an
incessant
effort
to
refrain
from
what
a
joy
to
declare
himself
a
hypocrite
and
snap
mocking
fingers
in
the
face
as
a
safeguard
he
fixed
his
mind
upon
sidwell
recalled
her
features
and
her
voice
as
clearly
as
possible
stamped
into
his
heart
the
conviction
that
she
half
loved
him
when
he
was
alone
again
he
of
a
sudden
determined
to
go
to
exeter
he
could
no
longer
endure
uncertainty
as
to
the
contents
of
letter
as
it
was
too
late
for
the
coach
he
set
off
and
walked
five
miles
to
exmouth
where
he
caught
a
train
the
letter
lay
on
his
table
and
with
it
one
on
which
he
recognised
his
mother
handwriting
marcella
wrote
in
the
simplest
way
quite
as
if
their
intercourse
had
never
been
disturbed
as
she
happened
to
be
staying
with
friends
at
budleigh
salterton
it
seemed
possible
for
her
to
meet
him
might
she
hope
that
he
would
call
at
the
hotel
in
exeter
if
she
wrote
again
to
make
an
appointment
well
that
needed
no
reply
but
how
had
she
discovered
the
address
was
his
story
known
in
london
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
he
crushed
the
letter
into
a
ball
and
flung
it
away
the
veins
of
his
forehead
swelled
he
walked
about
the
room
with
senseless
violence
striking
his
fist
against
furniture
and
walls
it
would
have
relieved
him
to
sob
and
cry
like
a
thwarted
child
but
only
a
harsh
sound
burst
from
his
throat
the
fit
passed
and
he
was
able
to
open
the
letter
from
twybridge
the
first
he
had
received
from
his
mother
for
more
than
a
month
he
expected
to
find
nothing
of
interest
but
his
attention
was
soon
caught
by
a
passage
which
ran
thus
you
heard
from
some
friends
of
yours
called
ward
some
time
ago
a
lady
called
here
to
ask
for
your
address
she
said
her
name
was
ward
and
that
her
husband
who
had
been
abroad
for
a
long
time
very
much
wished
to
find
you
again
of
course
i
told
her
where
you
were
to
be
found
it
was
just
after
i
had
written
or
i
should
have
let
you
know
about
it
before
ward
he
knew
no
one
of
that
name
could
it
be
marcella
who
had
done
this
it
looked
more
than
likely
he
believed
her
capable
of
strange
proceedings
in
the
morning
he
returned
to
the
seaside
prospect
of
pleasure
there
was
none
but
by
moving
about
he
made
the
time
pass
more
quickly
wandering
in
the
lanes
which
would
have
delighted
him
with
their
autumnal
beauties
had
his
mind
been
at
rest
he
came
upon
miss
walworth
busy
with
a
sketch
though
their
acquaintance
was
so
slight
he
stopped
for
conversation
and
the
artist
manner
appeared
to
testify
that
marcella
had
as
yet
made
no
unfavourable
report
of
him
by
mentioning
that
he
would
return
home
on
the
morrow
he
made
sure
that
marcella
would
be
apprised
of
this
perhaps
she
might
shorten
her
stay
and
his
suspense
back
in
longbrook
street
once
more
he
found
another
letter
it
was
from
warricombe
who
wrote
to
tell
him
of
their
coming
removal
to
london
and
added
an
invitation
to
dine
four
days
hence
then
at
all
events
he
would
speak
again
with
sidwell
but
to
what
purpose
could
he
let
her
go
away
for
months
and
perhaps
all
but
forget
him
among
the
many
new
faces
that
would
surround
her
he
saw
no
feasible
way
of
being
with
her
in
private
to
write
was
to
run
the
gravest
risk
things
were
not
ripe
for
that
to
take
martin
into
his
confidence
that
asked
too
much
courage
deliberate
avowals
of
this
kind
seemed
to
him
ludicrous
and
humiliating
and
under
the
circumstances
no
no
what
force
of
sincerity
could
make
him
appear
other
than
a
scheming
adventurer
he
lived
in
tumult
of
mind
and
senses
when
at
length
on
the
day
before
his
engagement
with
the
warricombes
there
came
a
note
from
marcella
summoning
him
to
the
interview
agreed
upon
he
could
scarcely
endure
the
hour
or
two
until
it
was
time
to
set
forth
every
minute
cost
him
a
throb
of
pain
the
torment
must
have
told
upon
his
visage
for
on
entering
the
room
where
marcella
waited
he
saw
that
she
looked
at
him
with
a
changing
expression
as
if
something
surprised
her
they
shook
hands
but
without
a
word
marcella
pointed
to
a
chair
yet
remained
standing
she
was
endeavouring
to
smile
her
eyes
fell
and
she
coloured
let
us
make
each
other
uncomfortable
peak
exclaimed
suddenly
in
the
tone
of
friendly
intimacy
nothing
tragic
in
this
affair
after
all
let
us
talk
quietly
marcella
seated
herself
had
reasons
he
went
on
going
away
from
my
old
acquaintances
for
a
time
why
not
if
i
chose
you
have
found
me
out
very
well
let
us
talk
it
over
as
we
have
discussed
many
another
moral
or
psychological
question
he
did
not
meditate
these
sentences
something
must
of
necessity
be
said
and
words
shaped
themselves
for
him
his
impulse
was
to
avoid
the
emotional
to
talk
with
this
problematic
woman
as
with
an
intellectual
friend
of
his
own
sex
me
were
the
first
sounds
that
came
from
marcella
lips
she
spoke
with
bent
head
and
almost
in
a
whisper
have
i
to
forgive
he
sat
down
and
leaned
sideways
in
the
easy
chair
were
curious
about
my
doings
what
more
natural
you
know
how
i
learnt
where
you
were
she
looked
up
for
an
instant
have
a
suspicion
you
went
to
twybridge
not
in
your
own
name
can
hardly
tell
why
not
peak
laughed
he
was
physically
and
mentally
at
rest
in
comparison
with
his
state
for
the
past
few
days
things
had
a
simpler
aspect
all
at
once
after
all
who
would
wish
to
interfere
maliciously
with
him
women
like
to
be
in
secrets
and
probably
marcella
would
preserve
his
conjectures
had
you
made
about
me
he
asked
with
an
air
of
amusement
of
course
but
i
heard
something
not
long
ago
which
seemed
so
unlikely
yet
was
told
so
confidently
that
at
last
i
could
overcome
my
wish
to
make
inquiries
what
was
that
malkin
has
been
to
america
and
he
declared
that
he
had
met
you
in
the
streets
of
boston
and
that
you
refused
to
admit
you
were
yourself
peak
laughed
still
more
buoyantly
his
mood
was
eager
to
seize
on
any
point
that
afforded
subject
for
jest
seems
to
have
come
across
my
doppelganger
one
must
pretend
to
certainty
in
anything
but
i
am
disposed
to
think
i
never
was
in
boston
was
of
course
mistaken
marcella
voice
had
an
indistinctness
very
unlike
her
ordinary
tone
as
a
rule
she
spoke
with
that
clearness
and
decision
which
corresponds
to
qualities
of
mind
not
commonly
found
in
women
but
confidence
seemed
to
have
utterly
deserted
her
she
had
lost
her
individuality
and
was
weakly
feminine
have
been
here
since
last
christmas
said
godwin
after
a
pause
i
know
their
eyes
met
doubt
your
friends
have
told
you
as
much
as
they
know
of
me
they
have
spoken
of
you
what
does
it
amount
to
he
regarded
her
steadily
with
a
smile
of
indifference
say
she
gazed
at
him
as
if
constrained
to
do
so
you
are
going
into
the
church
and
as
soon
as
she
uttered
the
last
word
a
painful
laugh
escaped
her
else
no
comments
think
miss
moorhouse
finds
it
difficult
to
understand
moorhouse
he
reflected
still
smiling
should
wonder
she
has
a
sceptical
mind
and
she
does
know
me
well
enough
to
understand
me
know
you
well
enough
she
repeated
the
words
mechanically
peak
gave
her
a
keen
glance
she
led
you
to
suppose
he
asked
we
are
on
intimate
terms
the
word
fell
from
her
absently
despondently
moxey
would
anything
be
gained
by
our
discussing
my
position
if
you
think
it
a
mystery
had
we
better
leave
it
so
she
made
no
answer
perhaps
he
went
on
have
told
them
the
walworths
and
the
moorhouses
that
i
owe
my
friends
an
explanation
when
i
see
them
again
perhaps
i
shall
be
confronted
with
cold
questioning
faces
have
said
a
word
that
could
injure
you
marcella
replied
with
something
of
her
usual
passing
her
eyes
distantly
over
his
face
as
she
spoke
knew
the
suggestion
was
unjust
when
i
made
it
why
should
you
refuse
me
your
confidence
she
bent
forward
slightly
but
with
her
eyes
cast
down
tone
and
features
intimated
a
sense
of
shame
due
partly
to
the
feeling
that
she
offered
complicity
in
deceit
can
i
tell
you
more
than
you
know
said
godwin
coldly
propose
to
become
a
clergyman
and
i
have
acknowledged
to
you
that
my
motive
is
ambition
as
the
matter
concerns
my
conscience
that
must
rest
with
myself
i
have
spoken
of
it
to
no
one
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
i
am
prepared
for
every
difficulty
that
may
spring
up
i
knew
of
course
that
sooner
or
later
some
one
would
discover
me
here
well
i
have
changed
my
opinions
that
all
who
can
demand
more
than
that
marcella
answered
in
a
tone
of
forced
composure
owe
me
no
explanation
at
all
yet
we
have
known
each
other
for
a
long
time
and
it
pains
me
that
to
be
suddenly
told
that
we
are
no
more
to
each
other
than
strangers
we
talking
like
strangers
marcella
she
flushed
and
her
eyes
gleamed
as
they
fixed
themselves
upon
him
for
an
instant
he
had
never
before
dreamt
of
addressing
her
so
familiarly
and
least
of
all
in
this
moment
was
she
prepared
for
it
godwin
despised
himself
for
the
impulse
to
which
he
had
yielded
but
its
policy
was
justified
he
had
taken
one
more
step
in
disingenuousness
a
small
matter
it
be
one
of
those
things
on
which
even
friends
do
open
their
minds
to
each
other
he
pursued
am
living
in
solitude
and
perhaps
must
do
so
for
several
years
yet
if
i
succeed
in
my
purposes
you
will
see
me
again
on
the
old
terms
if
i
fail
then
too
we
shall
be
friends
if
you
are
willing
wo
tell
me
what
those
purposes
are
you
can
imagine
them
you
let
me
ask
you
do
you
look
for
help
to
anyone
that
i
have
seen
here
she
spoke
with
effort
and
with
shame
no
one
that
you
have
met
he
answered
shortly
to
some
one
in
exeter
i
have
been
told
that
you
have
friends
he
was
irritated
by
her
persistency
and
his
own
inability
to
decide
upon
the
most
prudent
way
of
answering
mean
the
warricombe
family
i
suppose
think
it
very
likely
that
warricombe
may
be
able
to
help
me
substantially
marcella
kept
silence
then
without
raising
her
eyes
she
murmured
will
tell
me
no
more
is
nothing
more
to
tell
she
bit
her
lips
as
if
to
compel
them
to
muteness
her
breath
came
quickly
she
glanced
this
way
and
that
like
one
who
sought
an
escape
after
eyeing
her
askance
for
a
moment
peak
rose
are
going
she
said
but
surely
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
say
in
a
natural
and
friendly
way
you
forgive
me
for
that
deceit
i
practised
peak
laughed
does
it
matter
we
should
in
any
case
have
met
at
budleigh
salterton
i
had
no
serious
thought
of
accepting
their
invitation
she
stood
looking
away
from
him
endeavouring
to
speak
as
though
the
denial
had
but
slight
significance
godwin
stirred
impatiently
should
never
have
gone
to
twybridge
marcella
continued
for
malkin
story
he
turned
to
her
mean
that
his
story
had
a
disagreeable
sound
marcella
kept
silence
her
fingers
working
together
is
your
mind
relieved
he
added
wish
you
were
back
in
london
i
wish
this
change
had
never
come
to
pass
wish
that
several
things
in
my
life
had
never
come
to
pass
but
i
am
here
and
my
resolve
is
unalterable
one
thing
i
must
ask
you
how
shall
you
represent
my
position
to
your
brother
for
a
moment
marcella
hesitated
then
meeting
his
look
she
answered
with
nervous
haste
shall
not
mention
you
to
him
ashamed
to
give
any
sign
of
satisfaction
and
oppressed
by
the
feeling
that
he
owed
her
gratitude
peak
stood
gazing
towards
the
windows
with
an
air
of
abstractedness
it
was
better
to
let
the
interview
end
thus
without
comment
or
further
question
so
he
turned
abruptly
and
offered
his
hand
you
will
hear
of
me
or
from
me
he
tried
to
smile
but
marcella
had
a
cold
face
expressive
of
more
dignity
than
she
had
hitherto
shown
as
he
closed
the
door
she
was
still
looking
towards
him
he
knew
what
the
look
meant
in
his
position
a
man
of
ordinary
fibre
would
long
ago
have
nursed
the
flattering
conviction
that
marcella
loved
him
godwin
had
suspected
it
but
in
a
vague
unemotional
way
never
attaching
importance
to
the
matter
what
he
clearly
understood
was
that
christian
wished
to
inspire
him
with
interest
in
marcella
and
on
that
account
when
in
her
company
he
sometimes
set
himself
to
display
a
deliberate
negligence
no
difficult
undertaking
for
he
was
distinctly
repelled
by
the
thought
of
any
relations
with
her
more
intimate
than
had
been
brought
about
by
his
cold
intellectual
sympathy
her
person
was
still
as
disagreeable
to
him
as
when
he
first
met
her
in
her
uncle
house
at
twybridge
if
a
man
sincerely
hopes
that
a
woman
does
not
love
him
which
can
seldom
be
the
case
where
a
suggestion
of
such
feeling
ever
arises
he
will
find
it
easy
to
believe
that
she
does
not
peak
not
only
had
the
benefit
of
this
principle
the
constitution
of
his
mind
made
it
the
opposite
of
natural
for
him
to
credit
himself
with
having
inspired
affection
that
his
male
friends
held
him
in
any
warm
esteem
always
appeared
to
him
improbable
and
as
regards
women
his
modesty
was
profound
the
simplest
explanation
that
he
was
himself
incapable
of
pure
devotedness
perhaps
hits
the
truth
unsympathetic
however
he
could
with
no
justice
be
called
and
now
that
the
reality
of
marcella
love
was
forced
upon
his
consciousness
he
thought
of
her
with
sincere
pity
the
emotion
which
had
already
possessed
him
though
he
did
not
then
analyse
it
when
he
unsuspectingly
looked
into
her
troubled
face
a
few
days
ago
it
was
so
hard
to
believe
that
on
reaching
home
he
sat
for
a
long
time
occupied
with
the
thought
of
it
to
the
exclusion
of
his
own
anxieties
what
this
woman
had
made
of
an
ideal
such
as
he
himself
sought
among
the
most
exquisite
of
her
sex
how
was
that
possible
what
quality
of
his
personal
psychical
had
such
magnetic
force
what
sort
of
being
was
he
in
marcella
eyes
reflective
men
must
often
enough
marvel
at
the
success
of
whiskered
and
trousered
mortals
in
wooing
the
women
of
their
desire
for
only
by
a
specific
imagination
can
a
person
of
one
sex
assume
the
emotions
of
the
other
godwin
had
neither
that
endowment
nor
the
peculiar
which
makes
a
matter
of
course
to
some
intelligent
males
his
native
arrogance
signified
a
low
estimate
of
mankind
at
large
rather
than
an
overweening
appreciation
of
his
own
qualities
and
in
his
most
presumptuous
moments
he
had
never
claimed
the
sexual
refulgence
which
many
a
commonplace
fellow
so
gloriously
exhibits
at
most
he
had
hoped
that
some
woman
might
find
him
and
so
be
led
on
to
like
him
well
enough
for
the
venture
of
matrimony
passion
at
length
constrained
him
to
believe
that
his
ardour
might
be
genuinely
reciprocated
but
even
now
it
was
only
in
paroxysms
that
he
held
this
assurance
the
hours
of
ordinary
life
still
exposed
him
to
the
familiar
sometimes
more
scathing
than
ever
he
dreaded
the
consciously
avoided
it
and
a
like
disparagement
of
his
inner
being
tortured
him
through
the
endless
labyrinths
of
erotic
reverie
yet
here
was
a
woman
who
so
loved
him
that
not
even
a
proud
temper
and
his
candid
indifference
could
impose
restraint
upon
her
emotions
as
he
listened
to
the
most
significant
of
her
words
he
was
distressed
with
shame
and
now
in
recalling
them
he
felt
that
he
should
have
said
something
done
something
to
disillusion
her
could
he
not
easily
show
himself
in
a
contemptible
light
but
reflection
taught
him
that
the
shame
he
had
experienced
on
marcella
behalf
was
blended
with
a
gratification
which
forbade
him
at
the
moment
to
be
altogether
unamiable
it
was
not
alone
that
prompted
his
use
of
her
familiar
name
in
the
secret
places
of
his
heart
he
was
thankful
to
her
for
a
most
effective
encouragement
she
had
confirmed
him
in
the
hope
that
he
was
loved
by
sidwell
and
now
that
he
no
longer
feared
her
marcella
was
gradually
dismissed
from
mind
for
a
day
or
two
he
avoided
the
main
streets
of
the
town
lest
a
chance
meeting
with
her
should
revive
disquietude
but
by
the
time
that
warricombe
invitation
permitted
him
once
more
to
follow
his
desire
he
felt
assured
that
marcella
was
back
in
london
and
the
sense
of
distance
helped
to
banish
her
among
unrealities
the
hours
had
never
pressed
upon
him
with
such
demand
for
resolution
in
the
look
with
which
sidwell
greeted
him
when
he
met
her
in
the
he
seemed
to
read
much
more
than
wonted
friendliness
it
was
as
though
a
half
secret
already
existed
between
them
but
no
occasion
offered
for
a
word
other
than
trivial
the
consisted
of
about
a
score
of
people
and
throughout
the
evening
peak
found
himself
hopelessly
severed
from
the
one
person
whose
presence
was
anything
but
an
importunity
to
him
he
maddened
with
jealousy
with
fear
with
ceaseless
mental
manoeuvring
more
than
one
young
man
of
agreeable
aspect
appeared
to
be
on
dangerous
terms
with
sidwell
approaching
her
with
that
air
of
easy
intimacy
which
godwin
knew
too
well
he
would
never
be
able
to
assume
in
perfection
again
he
was
humiliated
by
with
social
superiors
and
again
reminded
that
in
this
circle
he
had
a
place
merely
on
sufferance
warricombe
when
he
chanced
to
speak
with
her
betrayed
the
slight
regard
in
which
she
really
held
him
and
martin
devoted
himself
to
more
important
people
the
evening
was
worse
than
lost
yet
in
two
more
days
sidwell
would
be
beyond
reach
he
writhed
upon
his
bed
as
the
image
of
her
loveliness
returned
again
and
again
her
face
as
she
conversed
at
table
her
dignity
as
she
rose
with
the
other
ladies
her
smile
when
he
said
a
smile
that
meant
more
than
civility
he
was
convinced
of
it
but
memory
would
not
support
him
through
of
solitude
and
passion
he
would
write
to
her
and
risk
all
two
in
the
morning
saw
him
sitting
at
the
table
raging
over
the
difficulties
of
a
composition
which
should
express
his
highest
self
four
saw
the
blotched
letter
torn
into
fragments
he
could
not
write
as
he
wished
could
not
hit
the
tone
of
manly
appeal
at
five
he
turned
wretchedly
into
bed
again
a
day
of
racking
headache
then
the
long
restful
sleep
which
brings
good
counsel
it
was
well
that
he
had
not
sent
a
letter
nor
in
any
other
way
committed
himself
if
sidwell
were
ever
to
be
his
wife
the
end
could
only
be
won
by
heroic
caution
and
patience
thus
far
he
had
achieved
notable
results
to
rush
upon
his
aim
would
be
the
most
absurd
departure
from
a
hopeful
scheme
gravely
devised
and
pursued
to
wait
to
establish
himself
in
the
confidence
of
this
family
to
make
sure
his
progress
step
by
step
that
was
the
course
indicated
from
the
first
by
his
calm
reason
other
men
might
triumph
by
sudden
audacity
for
him
was
no
hope
save
in
slow
persevering
energy
of
will
passion
had
all
but
ruined
him
now
he
had
recovered
sidwell
six
months
in
london
might
banish
him
from
her
mind
might
substitute
some
rival
against
whom
it
would
be
hopeless
to
contend
yes
but
a
thousand
possibilities
stood
with
menace
in
the
front
of
every
great
enterprise
before
next
spring
he
might
be
dead
defiance
then
of
every
foreboding
of
every
shame
and
a
life
that
moulded
itself
in
the
ardour
of
unchangeable
resolve
chapter
iv
martin
warricombe
was
reconciled
to
the
prospect
of
a
metropolitan
winter
by
the
fact
that
his
old
friend
thomas
gale
formerly
geological
professor
at
whitelaw
college
had
of
late
returned
from
a
three
sojourn
in
north
america
and
now
dwelt
in
london
the
breezy
man
of
science
was
welcomed
back
among
his
brethren
with
felicitation
his
book
on
the
appalachians
would
have
given
no
insufficient
proof
of
activity
abroad
but
evidence
more
generally
interesting
accompanied
him
in
the
shape
of
a
young
and
beautiful
wife
not
every
geologist
whose
years
have
entered
the
fifties
can
go
forth
and
capture
in
second
marriage
a
charming
new
england
girl
thirty
years
his
junior
yet
those
who
knew
gale
his
splendid
physique
his
bluff
cordiality
the
vigour
of
his
various
talk
were
scarcely
surprised
the
young
lady
was
no
heiress
she
had
in
fact
been
a
school
teacher
and
might
have
wearied
through
her
best
years
in
that
uncongenial
pursuit
transplanted
to
the
richest
english
soil
she
developed
remarkable
aptitudes
a
month
or
two
of
london
exhibited
her
as
a
type
of
all
that
is
most
attractive
in
american
womanhood
between
gale
and
the
warricombes
intimacy
was
soon
established
sidwell
saw
much
of
her
and
liked
her
to
this
meditative
english
girl
the
young
american
offered
an
engrossing
problem
for
she
avowed
her
indifference
to
all
religious
dogmas
yet
was
singularly
tolerant
and
displayed
a
moral
fervour
which
sidwell
had
believed
inseparable
from
christian
faith
at
the
gales
house
assembled
a
great
variety
of
intellectual
people
and
with
her
father
express
approval
martin
had
his
reasons
sidwell
made
the
most
of
this
opportunity
of
studying
the
modern
world
only
a
few
days
after
her
arrival
in
london
she
became
acquainted
with
a
walsh
a
brother
of
that
heresiarch
the
whitelaw
professor
whose
name
was
still
obnoxious
to
her
mother
he
was
a
man
of
something
between
thirty
and
forty
brilliant
in
conversation
personally
engaging
and
known
by
his
literary
productions
which
found
small
favour
with
conservative
readers
with
surprise
sidwell
in
a
short
time
became
aware
that
walsh
had
a
frank
liking
for
her
society
he
was
often
to
be
seen
in
warricombe
and
at
mrs
gale
he
yet
more
frequently
obtained
occasions
of
talking
with
her
the
candour
with
which
he
expressed
himself
on
most
subjects
enabled
her
to
observe
a
type
of
mind
which
at
present
had
peculiar
interest
for
her
discretion
often
put
restraint
upon
her
curiosity
but
none
the
less
walsh
had
plausible
grounds
for
believing
that
his
advances
were
not
unwelcome
he
saw
that
sidwell
gaze
occasionally
rested
upon
him
with
a
pleasant
gravity
and
noted
the
mood
of
meditation
which
sometimes
came
upon
her
when
he
had
drawn
apart
the
frequency
of
these
dialogues
was
observed
by
mrs
warricombe
and
one
evening
she
broached
the
subject
to
her
daughter
rather
abruptly
am
surprised
that
you
have
taken
such
a
liking
to
mr
walsh
sidwell
coloured
and
made
answer
in
the
quiet
tone
which
her
mother
had
come
to
understand
as
a
reproof
a
hint
of
defective
delicacy
do
think
i
have
behaved
in
a
way
that
should
cause
you
surprise
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
really
very
friendly
with
him
i
am
always
friendly
but
nothing
more
you
think
there
a
danger
of
his
misunderstanding
you
sidwell
do
mother
walsh
understands
that
we
differ
irreconcilably
on
subjects
of
the
first
importance
i
have
never
allowed
him
to
lose
sight
of
that
intellectual
differences
were
of
much
less
account
to
warricombe
than
to
her
daughter
and
her
judgment
in
a
matter
such
as
this
was
consequently
far
more
practical
i
may
advise
you
dear
you
ought
to
depend
much
on
that
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
has
noticed
something
i
only
mention
it
you
know
sidwell
mused
gravely
in
a
minute
or
two
she
looked
up
and
said
in
her
gentlest
voice
you
mother
i
will
be
more
careful
perhaps
she
had
lost
sight
of
prudence
forgetting
that
walsh
could
not
divine
her
thoughts
her
interest
in
him
was
impersonal
when
he
spoke
she
was
profoundly
attentive
only
because
her
mind
would
have
been
affected
in
the
same
way
had
she
been
reading
his
words
instead
of
listening
to
them
she
could
not
let
him
know
that
another
face
was
often
more
distinct
to
her
imagination
than
his
to
her
actual
sight
and
that
her
thoughts
were
frequently
more
busy
with
a
remembered
dialogue
than
with
this
in
which
she
was
engaged
she
had
abundantly
herself
against
serious
misconstruction
but
if
gossip
were
making
her
its
subject
it
would
be
inconsiderate
not
to
regard
the
warning
it
came
indeed
at
a
moment
when
she
was
very
willing
to
rest
from
social
activity
at
the
time
of
her
last
stay
in
london
three
years
ago
she
had
not
been
ripe
for
reflection
on
what
she
saw
now
her
mind
was
kept
so
incessantly
at
strain
and
her
emotions
answered
so
intensely
to
every
appeal
that
at
length
she
felt
the
need
of
repose
it
was
not
with
her
as
with
the
young
women
who
seek
only
to
make
the
most
of
their
time
in
agreeable
ways
sidwell
vital
forces
were
concentrated
in
an
effort
of
profound
spiritual
significance
the
critical
hour
of
her
life
was
at
hand
and
she
exerted
every
faculty
in
the
endeavour
to
direct
herself
aright
having
heard
from
his
brother
that
sidwell
had
not
been
out
for
several
days
buckland
took
an
opportunity
of
calling
at
the
house
early
one
morning
he
found
her
alone
in
a
small
and
sat
down
with
an
expression
of
weary
discontent
this
mood
had
been
frequent
in
the
young
man
of
late
sidwell
remarked
a
change
that
was
coming
over
him
a
gloominess
unnatural
to
his
character
the
walworths
lately
he
asked
when
his
sister
had
assured
him
that
she
was
not
seriously
ailing
called
a
few
days
ago
anyone
there
or
three
people
no
one
that
interested
me
have
come
across
some
friends
of
theirs
called
moxey
yes
miss
moxey
was
there
one
afternoon
about
a
fortnight
ago
you
talk
to
her
at
all
buckland
asked
we
had
much
to
say
to
each
other
though
how
do
you
know
of
her
through
sylvia
i
daresay
her
when
i
was
last
down
yonder
sidwell
had
long
since
heard
from
her
friend
of
miss
moxey
visit
to
budleigh
salterton
but
she
was
not
aware
that
buckland
had
been
there
at
the
same
time
sylvia
had
told
her
however
of
the
acquaintance
existing
between
miss
moxey
and
peak
a
point
of
much
interest
to
her
though
it
remained
a
mere
unconnected
fact
in
her
short
conversation
with
marcella
she
had
not
ventured
to
refer
to
it
you
know
anything
of
the
family
was
going
to
ask
you
the
same
returned
buckland
thought
you
might
have
heard
something
from
the
walworths
sidwell
had
in
fact
sought
information
but
as
her
relations
with
the
walworths
were
formal
such
inquiry
as
she
could
make
from
them
elicited
nothing
more
than
she
already
knew
from
sylvia
you
anxious
to
discover
who
they
are
she
asked
buckland
moved
uneasily
and
became
silent
not
particularly
dined
with
walsh
yesterday
he
said
at
length
struggling
to
shake
off
the
obvious
dreariness
that
oppressed
him
suits
me
we
can
get
on
together
doubt
you
do
dislike
him
i
think
that
i
dislike
said
sidwell
lightsomely
have
no
affection
for
my
walsh
is
an
honest
man
hope
so
says
what
he
thinks
no
compromise
with
fashionable
hypocrisy
despise
that
kind
of
thing
quite
as
much
as
you
do
they
looked
at
each
other
buckland
had
a
sullen
air
in
your
own
way
he
replied
are
sincere
enough
i
have
no
doubt
i
wish
all
women
were
so
exception
have
you
in
mind
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
answer
it
is
your
understanding
of
them
that
at
fault
added
sidwell
gently
in
one
case
at
all
events
he
exclaimed
you
were
asked
to
define
miss
moorhouse
religious
opinions
how
would
you
do
it
am
not
well
enough
acquainted
with
them
you
imagine
for
a
moment
that
she
has
any
more
faith
in
the
supernatural
than
i
have
think
there
is
a
great
difference
between
her
position
and
yours
she
is
hypocritical
cried
buckland
angrily
deceives
you
she
has
the
courage
to
be
honest
sidwell
wore
a
pained
expression
judge
her
she
replied
too
coarsely
no
one
is
called
upon
to
make
an
elaborate
declaration
of
faith
as
often
as
such
subjects
are
spoken
of
sylvia
thinks
so
differently
from
you
about
almost
everything
that
when
she
happens
to
agree
with
you
you
are
misled
and
misinterpret
her
whole
position
understand
her
perfectly
buckland
went
on
in
the
same
irritated
voice
are
plenty
of
women
like
her
with
brains
enough
but
utter
and
contemptible
cowards
cowards
even
to
themselves
perhaps
what
can
you
expect
when
society
is
based
on
rotten
shams
for
several
minutes
he
pursued
this
vein
of
invective
then
took
an
abrupt
leave
sidwell
had
a
piece
of
grave
counsel
ready
to
offer
him
but
he
was
clearly
in
no
mood
to
listen
so
she
postponed
it
a
day
or
two
after
this
she
received
a
letter
from
sylvia
miss
moorhouse
was
anything
but
a
good
correspondent
she
often
confessed
her
inability
to
compose
anything
but
the
briefest
and
driest
statement
of
facts
with
no
little
surprise
therefore
sidwell
found
that
the
envelope
contained
two
sheets
all
but
covered
with
her
friend
cramped
handwriting
the
letter
began
with
apology
for
long
delay
in
acknowledging
two
communications
you
know
well
enough
my
dilatory
disposition
i
have
written
to
you
mentally
at
least
once
a
day
and
i
hope
you
have
mentally
received
the
results
that
is
to
say
have
assured
yourself
of
my
goodwill
to
you
and
i
had
nothing
else
to
send
at
this
point
sylvia
had
carefully
obliterated
two
lines
blackening
the
page
into
unsightliness
in
vain
sidwell
pored
over
the
effaced
passage
led
to
do
so
by
a
fancy
that
she
could
discern
a
capital
p
which
looked
like
the
first
letter
of
a
name
the
writer
continued
trouble
yourself
so
much
about
insoluble
questions
try
to
be
more
positive
i
do
say
become
a
positivist
keep
a
receptive
mind
and
wait
for
time
to
shape
your
views
of
things
i
see
that
london
has
agitated
and
confused
you
you
have
lost
your
bearings
amid
the
maze
of
contradictory
if
you
were
here
i
could
soothe
you
with
sylvian
much
the
same
as
sylvan
philosophy
but
i
ca
write
here
the
letter
was
to
have
ended
for
on
the
line
beneath
was
legible
my
love
to
fanny
but
this
again
had
been
crossed
out
and
there
followed
a
long
paragraph
i
have
been
reading
a
book
about
ants
perhaps
you
know
all
the
wonderful
things
about
them
but
i
had
neglected
that
branch
of
natural
history
their
doings
are
astonishingly
like
those
of
an
animal
called
man
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
discovered
one
point
of
resemblance
which
perhaps
has
never
been
noted
are
you
aware
that
at
an
early
stage
of
their
existence
ants
have
wings
they
fly
how
shall
i
express
it
only
for
the
brief
time
of
their
courtship
and
marriage
and
when
these
important
affairs
are
satisfactorily
done
with
their
wings
wither
away
and
thenceforth
they
have
to
content
themselves
with
running
about
on
the
earth
now
is
this
a
remarkable
parallel
to
one
stage
of
human
life
do
not
men
and
women
also
soar
and
flutter
at
a
certain
time
and
do
their
wings
manifestly
drop
off
as
soon
as
the
end
of
that
skyward
movement
has
been
achieved
if
the
gods
had
made
me
poetical
i
would
sonnetise
on
this
idea
do
you
know
any
poet
with
a
fondness
for
the
if
so
offer
him
this
suggestion
with
liberty
to
make
any
use
of
it
he
likes
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
some
human
beings
are
never
winged
at
all
i
am
decidedly
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
i
am
one
of
those
think
of
me
henceforth
as
an
apteryx
you
have
a
dictionary
at
hand
like
the
tailless
fox
i
might
naturally
maintain
that
my
state
is
the
more
gracious
but
honestly
i
am
not
assured
of
that
it
may
be
i
half
believe
it
is
a
good
thing
to
soar
and
flutter
and
at
times
i
regret
that
nature
has
forbidden
me
that
experience
decidedly
i
would
never
try
to
anyone
to
forego
the
use
of
wings
bear
this
in
mind
my
dear
girl
but
i
suspect
that
in
time
to
come
there
will
be
an
increasing
number
of
female
human
creatures
who
from
their
birth
are
content
with
not
long
ago
i
had
occasion
to
hint
that
though
under
another
figure
to
your
brother
buckland
i
hope
he
understood
me
i
think
he
did
and
that
he
was
offended
had
something
to
tell
you
i
have
forgotten
it
never
mind
and
therewith
the
odd
epistle
was
concluded
sidwell
perused
the
latter
part
several
times
of
course
she
was
at
no
loss
to
interpret
it
buckland
demeanour
for
the
past
two
months
had
led
her
to
surmise
that
his
latest
visit
to
budleigh
salterton
had
finally
extinguished
the
hopes
which
drew
him
in
that
direction
his
recent
censure
of
sylvia
might
be
thus
explained
she
grieved
that
her
brother
suit
should
be
discouraged
but
could
not
persuade
herself
that
decision
was
final
the
idea
of
a
match
between
those
two
was
very
pleasant
to
her
for
buckland
she
imagined
it
would
be
fraught
with
good
results
and
for
sylvia
on
the
whole
it
might
be
the
best
thing
before
she
replied
to
her
friend
nearly
a
month
passed
and
christmas
was
at
hand
again
she
had
been
much
in
society
walsh
had
renewed
his
unmistakable
attentions
and
when
her
manner
of
meeting
them
began
to
trouble
him
with
doubts
had
cleared
the
air
by
making
a
formal
offer
of
marriage
sidwell
negative
was
absolute
much
to
her
mother
relief
on
the
day
of
that
event
she
wrote
rather
a
long
letter
to
sylvia
but
walsh
name
was
not
mentioned
in
it
tells
me
it
began
that
mother
has
written
to
her
from
salisbury
and
that
you
yourself
are
going
there
for
a
stay
of
some
weeks
i
am
sorry
for
on
the
monday
after
christmas
day
i
shall
be
in
exeter
and
hoped
somehow
to
have
seen
you
we
mother
and
i
are
going
to
run
down
together
to
see
after
certain
domestic
affairs
only
for
three
days
at
most
was
very
amusing
but
it
saddened
me
dear
sylvia
i
ca
make
any
answer
on
these
subjects
it
is
very
difficult
even
for
the
closest
friends
to
open
their
minds
to
each
other
i
do
and
do
wish
to
believe
in
the
profession
that
all
i
must
say
health
has
been
indifferent
since
i
last
wrote
we
live
in
all
but
continuous
darkness
and
very
seldom
indeed
breathe
anything
that
can
be
called
air
no
doubt
this
state
of
things
has
its
effect
on
me
i
look
forwards
not
to
the
coming
of
spring
for
here
we
shall
see
nothing
of
its
beauties
but
to
the
month
which
will
release
us
from
london
i
want
to
smell
the
pines
again
and
to
see
the
golden
gorse
in
road
way
of
being
more
positive
i
have
read
much
in
the
newspapers
supplementing
from
them
my
own
experience
of
london
society
the
result
is
that
i
am
more
and
more
confirmed
in
the
fears
with
which
i
have
already
worried
you
two
movements
are
plainly
going
on
in
the
life
of
our
day
the
decay
of
religious
belief
is
undermining
morality
and
the
progress
of
radicalism
in
politics
is
working
to
the
same
end
by
overthrowing
social
distinctions
evidence
stares
one
in
the
face
from
every
column
of
the
papers
of
course
you
have
read
more
or
less
about
the
recent
scandal
i
mean
the
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
one
cares
to
discuss
but
we
ca
help
knowing
about
it
and
does
it
not
strongly
support
what
i
say
here
is
materialism
sinking
into
brutal
immorality
and
high
social
rank
degrading
itself
by
intimacy
with
the
corrupt
vulgar
there
are
newspapers
that
make
political
capital
out
of
these
revelations
i
have
read
some
of
them
and
they
make
me
so
aristocratic
that
i
find
it
hard
to
care
anything
at
all
even
for
the
humanitarian
efforts
of
people
i
respect
you
will
tell
me
i
know
that
this
is
quite
the
wrong
way
of
looking
at
it
but
the
evils
are
so
monstrous
that
it
is
hard
to
fix
one
mind
on
the
good
that
may
long
hence
result
from
them
cling
to
the
essential
that
is
the
truths
of
christianity
as
the
only
absolute
good
left
in
our
time
i
would
say
that
i
care
nothing
for
forms
but
some
form
there
must
be
else
faith
evaporates
it
has
become
very
easy
for
me
to
understand
how
men
and
women
who
know
the
world
refuse
to
believe
any
longer
in
a
directing
providence
a
week
ago
i
again
met
miss
moxey
at
the
walworths
and
talked
with
her
more
freely
than
before
this
conversation
showed
me
that
i
have
become
much
more
tolerant
towards
individuals
but
though
this
or
that
person
may
be
supported
by
moral
sense
alone
the
world
can
not
dispense
with
religion
if
it
tries
to
and
it
there
are
dreadful
times
before
us
wish
i
were
a
man
i
would
do
something
however
ineffectual
i
would
stand
on
the
side
of
those
who
are
fighting
against
and
how
would
you
like
to
see
exeter
cathedral
converted
into
a
coffee
and
that
will
come
reading
this
sylvia
had
the
sense
of
listening
to
an
echo
some
of
the
phrases
recalled
to
her
quite
a
different
voice
from
sidwell
she
smiled
and
mused
on
the
morning
appointed
for
her
journey
to
exeter
sidwell
rose
early
and
in
unusually
good
spirits
warricombe
was
less
animated
by
the
prospect
of
five
hours
in
a
railway
carriage
for
london
had
a
covering
of
black
snow
and
it
seemed
likely
that
more
would
fall
martin
suggested
postponement
but
circumstances
made
this
undesirable
fanny
go
with
me
proposed
sidwell
just
after
breakfast
can
see
to
everything
perfectly
well
mother
but
fanny
hastened
to
decline
she
was
engaged
for
a
dance
on
the
morrow
i
run
down
with
you
myself
sidwell
said
her
father
warricombe
looked
at
the
weather
and
hesitated
there
were
strong
reasons
why
she
should
go
and
they
determined
her
to
brave
discomforts
it
chanced
that
the
morning
post
had
brought
warricombe
a
letter
from
godwin
peak
it
was
a
reply
to
one
that
he
had
written
with
christmas
greetings
a
kindness
natural
in
him
for
he
had
remembered
that
the
young
man
was
probably
hard
at
work
in
his
lonely
lodgings
he
spoke
of
it
privately
to
his
wife
very
good
letter
thoughtful
and
cheerful
you
not
likely
to
see
him
but
if
you
happen
to
say
a
pleasant
word
should
have
written
if
i
were
you
remarked
warricombe
not
i
was
only
thinking
the
other
day
that
he
contrasted
very
favourably
with
the
younger
generation
as
we
observe
it
here
yes
i
have
faith
in
peak
there
the
right
stuff
in
him
i
daresay
but
still
and
warricombe
went
away
with
an
air
of
misgiving
chapter
v
in
volunteering
a
promise
not
to
inform
her
brother
of
peak
singular
position
marcella
spoke
with
sincerity
she
was
prompted
by
incongruous
feelings
a
desire
to
compel
godwin
gratitude
and
disdain
of
the
circumstances
in
which
she
had
discovered
him
there
seemed
to
be
little
likelihood
of
christian
learning
from
any
other
person
that
she
had
met
with
peak
at
budleigh
salterton
he
had
indeed
dined
with
her
at
the
walworths
and
might
improve
his
acquaintance
with
that
family
but
it
was
improbable
that
they
would
ever
mention
in
his
hearing
the
stranger
who
had
casually
been
presented
to
them
or
indeed
ever
again
think
of
him
if
she
held
her
peace
the
secret
of
godwin
retirement
must
still
remain
impenetrable
he
would
pursue
his
ends
as
hitherto
thinking
of
if
at
all
as
a
weak
woman
who
had
immodestly
betrayed
a
hopeless
passion
and
who
could
be
trusted
never
to
wish
him
harm
that
was
marcella
way
of
reading
a
man
thoughts
she
did
not
attribute
to
peak
the
penetration
which
would
make
him
uneasy
in
spite
of
masculine
proverbs
it
is
the
habit
of
women
to
suppose
that
the
other
sex
regards
them
confidingly
ingenuously
marcella
was
unusually
endowed
with
analytic
intelligence
but
in
this
case
she
believed
what
she
hoped
she
knew
that
peak
confidence
in
her
must
be
coloured
with
contempt
but
this
mattered
little
so
long
as
he
paid
her
the
compliment
of
feeling
sure
that
she
was
superior
to
ignoble
temptations
many
a
woman
would
behave
with
treacherous
malice
it
was
in
her
power
to
expose
him
to
confound
all
his
schemes
for
she
knew
the
authorship
of
that
remarkable
paper
in
critical
before
receiving
peak
injunction
of
secrecy
earwaker
had
talked
of
new
sophistry
with
moxey
and
with
malkin
the
request
came
too
late
in
her
interview
with
godwin
at
the
exeter
hotel
she
had
not
even
hinted
at
this
knowledge
partly
because
she
was
unconscious
that
peak
imagined
the
affair
a
secret
between
himself
and
earwaker
partly
because
she
thought
it
unworthy
of
her
even
to
seem
to
threaten
it
gratified
her
however
to
feel
that
he
was
at
her
mercy
and
the
thought
preoccupied
her
for
many
days
passion
which
has
the
intellect
on
its
side
is
more
easily
endured
than
that
which
offers
sensual
defiance
to
all
reasoning
but
on
the
other
hand
it
lasts
much
longer
marcella
was
not
consumed
by
her
emotions
she
often
thought
calmly
coldly
of
the
man
she
loved
yet
he
was
seldom
long
out
of
her
mind
and
the
instigation
of
circumstances
at
times
made
her
suffering
intense
such
an
occasion
was
her
first
meeting
with
sidwell
warricombe
which
took
place
at
the
walworths
in
london
down
in
devonshire
she
had
learnt
that
a
family
named
warricombe
were
peak
intimate
friends
nothing
more
than
this
for
indeed
no
one
was
in
a
position
to
tell
her
more
wakeful
jealousy
caused
her
to
fix
upon
the
fact
as
one
of
significance
evasive
manner
when
she
questioned
him
confirmed
her
suspicions
and
as
soon
as
she
was
brought
face
to
face
with
sidwell
suspicion
became
certainty
she
knew
at
once
that
miss
warricombe
was
the
very
person
who
would
be
supremely
attractive
to
godwin
peak
an
interval
of
weeks
and
again
she
saw
the
face
that
in
the
meantime
had
been
as
present
to
her
imagination
as
godwin
own
features
this
time
she
conversed
at
some
length
with
miss
warricombe
was
it
merely
a
fancy
that
the
beautiful
woman
looked
at
her
spoke
to
her
with
some
exceptional
interest
by
now
she
had
learnt
that
the
moorhouses
and
the
warricombes
were
connected
in
close
friendship
it
was
all
but
certain
then
that
miss
moorhouse
had
told
miss
warricombe
of
peak
visit
to
budleigh
salterton
and
its
incidents
could
this
in
any
way
be
explanatory
of
the
steady
searching
look
in
those
soft
eyes
marcella
had
always
regarded
the
emotion
of
jealousy
as
characteristic
of
a
vulgar
nature
now
that
it
possessed
her
she
endeavoured
to
call
it
by
other
names
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
indignant
on
abstract
grounds
or
anxious
only
with
reference
to
peak
true
interests
she
could
not
affect
surprise
so
intensely
sympathetic
was
her
reading
of
godwin
character
that
she
understood
or
at
all
events
recognised
the
power
sidwell
would
possess
over
him
he
did
not
care
for
enlightenment
in
a
woman
he
was
sensual
though
in
a
subtle
way
the
aristocratic
vein
in
his
temper
made
him
subject
to
strong
impressions
from
trivialities
of
personal
demeanour
of
social
tone
yet
all
was
mere
conjecture
she
had
not
dared
to
utter
peak
name
lest
in
doing
so
she
should
betray
herself
constantly
planning
to
make
further
discoveries
she
as
constantly
tried
to
dismiss
all
thought
of
the
matter
to
learn
indifference
already
she
had
debased
herself
and
her
nature
must
be
contemptible
indeed
if
anything
could
lure
her
forward
on
such
a
path
none
the
less
she
was
assiduous
in
maintaining
friendly
relations
with
the
walworths
christian
too
had
got
into
the
habit
of
calling
there
it
was
significant
of
the
noticeable
change
which
was
come
upon
him
a
change
his
sister
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
the
moment
that
he
informed
her
gravely
but
without
expressiveness
of
death
instead
of
shunning
ordinary
society
he
seemed
bent
on
extending
the
circle
of
his
acquaintance
he
urged
marcella
to
invite
friendly
calls
to
have
guests
at
dinner
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
revival
of
his
energies
exhibited
in
the
sphere
of
study
as
well
as
of
amusement
not
a
day
went
by
without
his
purchasing
books
or
scientific
apparatus
and
the
house
was
brightened
with
works
of
art
chosen
in
the
studios
which
miss
walworth
advised
him
to
visit
all
the
amiabilities
of
his
character
came
into
free
play
with
marcella
he
was
mirthful
affectionate
even
caressing
he
grew
scrupulous
about
his
neckties
his
gloves
and
was
careful
to
guard
his
fingers
against
corroding
acids
when
he
worked
in
the
laboratory
such
indications
of
hopefulness
caused
marcella
more
misgiving
than
pleasure
she
made
no
remark
but
waited
with
anxiety
for
some
light
on
the
course
of
events
just
before
dinner
one
evening
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
christian
entered
with
a
look
which
portended
some
strange
announcement
he
spoke
abruptly
have
heard
something
astonishing
is
that
afternoon
i
went
to
the
matinee
at
the
vaudeville
and
found
myself
among
a
lot
of
our
friends
the
walworths
and
the
hunters
and
the
mortons
between
the
acts
i
was
talking
to
hunter
when
a
man
came
up
to
us
spoke
to
hunter
and
was
introduced
to
me
a
mr
warricombe
what
do
you
think
he
said
i
believe
you
know
my
friend
peak
mr
moxey
peak
to
be
sure
can
you
tell
me
what
has
become
of
him
he
gave
me
an
odd
look
why
i
met
him
last
some
two
months
ago
in
devonshire
at
that
moment
we
were
obliged
to
go
to
our
places
and
i
could
get
hold
of
the
fellow
again
hunter
told
me
something
about
him
he
knows
the
walworths
it
seems
belongs
to
a
good
devonshire
family
what
on
earth
can
peak
be
doing
over
there
marcella
kept
silence
the
event
she
had
judged
improbable
had
come
to
pass
the
chance
of
its
doing
so
had
of
course
increased
since
christian
began
to
associate
freely
with
the
walworths
and
their
circle
yet
considering
the
slightness
of
the
connection
between
that
group
of
people
and
the
warricombe
family
there
had
seemed
no
great
likelihood
of
christian
getting
acquainted
with
the
latter
she
debated
rapidly
in
her
troubled
mind
how
to
meet
this
disclosure
curiosity
would
of
course
impel
her
brother
to
follow
up
the
clue
he
would
again
encounter
warricombe
and
must
then
learn
all
the
facts
of
peak
position
to
what
purpose
should
she
dissemble
her
own
knowledge
did
she
desire
that
godwin
should
remain
in
security
a
tremor
more
akin
to
gladness
than
its
opposite
impeded
her
utterance
if
warricombe
became
aware
of
all
that
was
involved
in
godwin
peak
withdrawal
from
among
his
friends
if
as
must
follow
he
imparted
the
discovery
to
his
sister
the
necessity
of
speaking
enabled
her
to
ignore
these
turbulent
speculations
which
yet
were
anything
but
new
to
her
met
at
budleigh
salterton
she
said
quietly
did
warricombe
and
peak
at
the
moorhouses
it
was
when
i
was
there
christian
stared
at
her
you
were
there
but
met
peak
his
sister
smiled
turning
from
the
astonished
gaze
i
met
him
why
the
deuce
why
did
you
tell
me
marcella
asked
me
not
to
speak
of
it
he
did
wish
you
to
know
that
that
he
has
decided
to
become
a
clergyman
christian
was
stricken
dumb
in
spite
of
his
sister
obvious
agitation
he
could
not
believe
what
she
told
him
her
smile
gave
him
an
excuse
for
supposing
that
she
jested
a
clergyman
he
burst
out
laughing
the
meaning
of
all
this
do
speak
intelligibly
what
the
fellow
up
to
am
quite
serious
he
is
studying
for
orders
has
been
for
this
last
year
in
desperation
christian
turned
to
another
phase
of
the
subject
malkin
mistaken
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
peak
give
me
more
details
he
living
how
has
he
got
to
know
people
like
these
warricombes
marcella
told
all
that
she
knew
and
without
injunction
of
secrecy
the
affair
had
passed
out
of
her
hands
destiny
must
fulfil
itself
and
again
the
tremor
that
resembled
an
uneasy
joy
went
through
her
frame
how
asked
christian
this
fellow
warricombe
come
to
know
that
was
a
friend
of
peak
a
puzzle
to
me
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
remembered
my
name
and
even
if
he
had
how
could
he
conclude
she
broke
off
pondering
warricombe
must
have
made
inquiries
possibly
suggested
by
suspicions
scarcely
spoke
of
mr
peak
to
anyone
she
added
saw
of
course
that
we
were
acquaintances
but
it
could
have
seemed
a
thing
of
any
importance
spoke
with
him
in
private
it
seems
i
saw
him
for
a
few
minutes
in
exeter
you
had
said
anything
to
the
walworths
that
that
would
surprise
them
why
should
i
injure
him
christian
knit
his
brows
he
understood
too
well
why
his
sister
should
refrain
from
such
injury
would
have
behaved
in
the
same
way
marcella
added
really
yes
perhaps
so
yet
i
do
in
plain
english
peak
is
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
do
know
anything
about
that
she
replied
with
gloomy
evasion
my
dear
girl
had
he
the
impudence
to
pretend
to
you
that
he
was
sincere
made
no
declaration
you
are
convinced
he
is
acting
the
hypocrite
marcella
you
spoke
of
the
risk
of
injuring
what
are
his
motives
what
does
he
aim
at
a
bishopric
i
should
think
she
replied
bitterly
by
jove
earwaker
may
be
right
marcella
darted
an
inquiring
look
at
him
has
he
thought
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
he
suggested
once
that
peak
might
disguise
himself
for
the
sake
of
of
making
a
good
marriage
the
reply
was
a
nervous
laugh
here
marcella
he
caught
her
hand
is
a
very
awkward
business
peak
is
disgracing
himself
he
will
be
unmasked
there
be
a
scandal
it
was
kind
of
you
to
keep
silence
when
do
you
behave
kindly
dear
girl
but
think
of
the
possible
results
to
we
shall
be
something
very
like
accomplices
marcella
exclaimed
impatiently
need
know
that
we
were
so
intimate
with
him
seems
to
know
it
can
prove
that
he
is
sincere
one
perhaps
but
it
will
seem
a
very
odd
thing
that
he
hid
away
from
all
his
old
friends
you
remember
i
betrayed
that
to
warricombe
before
i
knew
that
it
mattered
yes
and
warricombe
could
hardly
forget
the
circumstance
he
would
press
his
investigation
knowing
already
perhaps
of
peak
approaches
to
his
sister
sidwell
a
man
plays
games
like
that
at
his
own
peril
i
do
like
this
kind
of
thing
perhaps
he
has
audacity
enough
to
face
out
any
disclosure
but
it
out
of
the
question
for
you
and
me
to
nurse
his
secret
we
have
no
right
to
do
so
propose
to
denounce
him
marcella
gazed
at
her
brother
with
an
agitated
look
denounce
i
am
fond
of
peak
i
wish
him
well
but
i
ca
join
him
in
a
dishonourable
then
we
must
endanger
our
place
in
society
have
no
place
in
society
marcella
answered
coldly
say
that
and
do
think
it
we
are
both
going
to
make
more
of
our
lives
we
are
going
to
think
very
little
of
the
past
and
a
great
deal
of
the
future
we
are
still
young
we
have
happiness
before
us
she
asked
with
shaken
voice
both
of
us
who
can
say
again
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
in
both
his
own
just
then
the
door
opened
and
dinner
was
announced
christian
talked
on
in
low
hurried
tones
for
several
minutes
affectionately
encouragingly
after
dinner
he
wished
to
resume
the
subject
but
marcella
declared
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
he
must
act
as
honour
and
discretion
bade
him
for
herself
she
should
simply
keep
silence
as
hitherto
and
she
left
him
to
his
reflections
though
with
so
little
of
ascertained
fact
to
guide
her
marcella
interpreted
the
hints
afforded
by
her
slight
knowledge
of
the
warricombes
with
singular
accuracy
precisely
as
she
had
imagined
buckland
warricombe
was
going
about
on
peak
track
learning
all
he
could
concerning
the
theological
student
forming
acquaintance
with
anyone
likely
to
supplement
his
discoveries
and
less
than
a
fortnight
after
the
meeting
at
the
theatre
christian
made
known
to
his
sister
that
warricombe
and
he
had
had
a
second
conversation
this
time
uninterrupted
inquired
after
you
marcella
and
really
i
had
no
choice
but
to
ask
him
to
call
here
i
hardly
think
he
come
he
not
the
kind
of
man
i
care
for
though
liberal
enough
and
all
that
it
rather
rash
to
give
that
invitation
fact
was
i
so
dreaded
the
appearance
of
of
seeming
to
avoid
him
christian
pleaded
awkwardly
know
that
affair
we
talk
any
more
of
it
but
if
there
be
a
row
about
it
you
are
sure
to
be
compromised
unless
we
have
managed
to
guard
ourselves
if
warricombe
calls
we
must
talk
about
peak
without
the
least
show
of
restraint
let
it
appear
that
we
thought
his
choice
of
a
profession
unlikely
but
not
impossible
happily
we
need
know
anything
about
that
anonymous
indeed
i
think
i
have
acted
wisely
marcella
murmured
i
suppose
you
have
by
the
way
i
have
spoken
of
it
to
earwaker
not
of
your
part
in
the
story
of
course
i
told
him
that
i
had
met
a
man
who
knew
all
about
impossible
you
see
for
me
to
keep
silence
with
so
intimate
a
friend
earwaker
will
write
to
him
said
marcella
reflectively
could
give
him
any
address
does
warricombe
seem
to
regard
mr
peak
a
good
deal
of
interest
and
of
the
friendliest
kind
naturally
enough
they
were
college
friends
as
you
know
before
i
had
heard
of
peak
existence
has
no
suspicions
christian
thought
not
but
her
brother
judgment
had
not
much
weight
with
marcella
she
at
once
dreaded
and
desired
warricombe
appearance
if
he
thought
it
worth
while
to
cultivate
her
acquaintance
she
would
henceforth
have
the
opportunity
of
studying
peak
relations
with
the
warricombes
on
the
other
hand
this
was
to
expose
herself
to
suffering
and
temptation
from
which
the
better
part
of
her
nature
shrank
with
disdain
that
she
might
seem
to
have
broken
the
promise
voluntarily
made
to
godwin
was
a
small
matter
not
so
the
risk
of
being
overcome
by
an
ignoble
jealousy
she
had
no
overweening
confidence
in
the
steadfastness
of
her
if
circumstances
were
all
on
the
side
of
sensual
impulse
and
the
longer
she
brooded
on
this
peril
the
more
it
allured
her
for
therewith
was
connected
the
one
satisfaction
which
still
remained
to
her
however
little
he
desired
to
keep
her
constantly
in
mind
godwin
peak
must
of
necessity
do
so
after
what
had
passed
between
them
had
but
her
discovery
remained
her
own
secret
then
the
pleasure
of
commanding
her
less
pure
emotions
of
proving
to
godwin
that
she
was
above
the
weakness
of
common
women
might
easily
have
prevailed
now
that
her
knowledge
was
shared
by
others
she
had
lost
that
safeguard
against
lower
motive
the
argument
that
to
unmask
hypocrisy
was
in
itself
laudable
she
dismissed
with
contempt
let
that
be
the
resource
of
a
woman
who
would
indulge
her
rancour
whilst
keeping
up
the
inward
pretence
of
sanctity
if
erred
in
the
ways
characteristic
of
her
sex
it
should
at
all
events
be
a
conscious
degradation
you
seen
that
odd
creature
malkin
lately
she
asked
of
christian
a
day
or
two
after
i
have
i
thought
of
him
to
make
up
our
dinner
on
sunday
but
you
had
rather
not
have
him
here
i
daresay
he
is
amusing
ask
him
by
all
means
said
marcella
carelessly
may
have
heard
about
peak
from
earwaker
you
know
if
he
begins
to
talk
before
people
have
gone
too
far
for
such
considerations
replied
his
sister
with
a
petulance
strange
to
her
habits
of
speech
yes
admitted
christian
glancing
at
her
ca
be
responsible
he
reproached
himself
for
this
attitude
towards
peak
but
was
heartily
glad
that
marcella
seemed
to
have
learnt
to
regard
the
intriguer
with
a
wholesome
indifference
on
the
second
day
after
christmas
as
they
sat
talking
idly
in
the
dusking
twilight
the
door
of
the
was
thrown
open
and
a
visitor
announced
the
name
answered
with
such
startling
suddenness
to
the
thought
with
which
marcella
had
been
occupied
that
for
an
instant
she
could
not
believe
that
she
had
heard
aright
yet
it
was
undoubtedly
warricombe
who
presented
himself
he
came
forward
with
a
slightly
hesitating
air
but
christian
made
haste
to
smooth
the
situation
with
the
help
of
those
commonplaces
by
which
even
intellectual
people
are
at
times
compelled
to
prove
their
familiarity
with
social
usages
conversation
was
set
in
movement
buckland
could
not
be
quite
himself
the
consciousness
that
he
had
sought
these
people
not
at
all
for
their
own
sake
made
him
formal
and
dry
his
glances
his
indicated
a
doubt
whether
the
moxeys
belonged
entirely
to
the
sphere
in
which
he
was
at
home
hence
a
rather
excessive
politeness
such
as
the
man
who
sets
much
store
on
breeding
exhibits
to
those
who
may
at
any
moment
even
in
a
fraction
of
a
syllable
prove
themselves
his
inferiors
with
men
and
women
of
the
unmistakably
lower
orders
buckland
could
converse
in
a
genial
tone
that
recommended
him
to
their
esteem
on
the
borderland
of
refinement
his
sympathies
were
repressed
and
he
held
the
distinctive
part
of
his
mind
in
reserve
marcella
desired
to
talk
agreeably
but
a
weight
lay
upon
her
tongue
she
was
struck
with
the
resemblance
in
warricombe
features
to
those
of
his
sister
and
this
held
her
in
a
troubled
preoccupation
occasionally
evident
when
she
made
a
reply
or
tried
to
diversify
the
talk
by
leading
to
a
new
topic
it
was
rather
early
in
the
afternoon
and
she
had
slight
hope
that
any
other
caller
would
appear
a
female
face
would
have
been
welcome
to
her
even
that
of
foolish
morton
who
might
possibly
look
in
before
six
to
her
relief
the
door
did
presently
open
but
the
sharp
creaking
footstep
which
followed
was
no
lady
the
servant
announced
malkin
marcella
eyes
gleamed
strangely
not
with
the
light
of
friendly
welcome
though
for
that
it
could
be
mistaken
she
rose
quietly
and
stepped
forward
with
a
movement
which
again
seemed
to
betoken
eagerness
of
greeting
in
presenting
the
newcomer
to
warricombe
she
spoke
with
an
uncertain
voice
buckland
was
more
than
formal
the
aspect
impressed
him
far
from
favourably
and
he
resented
as
an
impudence
the
hearty
to
which
he
perforce
submitted
come
to
plead
with
you
exclaimed
malkin
turning
to
marcella
in
his
abrupt
excited
way
accepting
your
invitation
to
dine
i
find
that
the
thing
is
utterly
and
absolutely
impossible
i
had
entirely
forgotten
an
engagement
of
the
very
gravest
nature
i
am
conscious
of
behaving
in
quite
an
unpardonable
way
marcella
laughed
down
his
excuses
she
had
suddenly
become
so
mirthful
that
christian
looked
at
her
in
surprise
imagining
that
she
was
unable
to
restrain
her
sense
of
the
ridiculous
in
malkin
demeanour
have
hurried
up
from
wrotham
pursued
the
apologist
i
tell
you
moxey
that
i
had
taken
rooms
down
there
to
be
able
to
spend
a
day
or
two
near
my
friends
the
jacoxes
occasionally
on
the
way
here
i
looked
in
at
staple
inn
but
earwaker
is
away
somewhere
what
an
odd
thing
that
people
will
go
off
without
letting
one
know
it
such
common
of
mine
to
find
people
gone
away
i
really
astonished
to
find
you
at
home
miss
moxey
marcella
looked
at
warricombe
and
laughed
must
understand
that
subjectively
she
said
with
nervous
gaiety
which
again
excited
her
brother
surprise
do
be
discouraged
by
it
from
coming
to
see
us
again
i
am
very
rarely
out
in
the
afternoon
persisted
malkin
precisely
my
ill
fortune
to
hit
on
those
rare
moments
when
people
out
now
i
never
meet
acquaintances
in
the
streets
of
london
but
if
i
happen
to
be
abroad
as
likely
as
not
i
encounter
the
last
person
i
should
expect
to
find
why
you
remember
i
rush
over
to
america
for
scarcely
a
week
stay
and
there
i
come
across
a
man
who
has
disappeared
astonishingly
from
the
ken
of
all
his
friends
christian
looked
at
marcella
she
was
leaning
forward
her
lips
slightly
parted
her
eyes
wide
as
if
in
gaze
at
something
that
fascinated
her
he
saw
that
she
spoke
but
her
voice
was
hardly
to
be
recognised
you
quite
sure
of
that
instance
mr
malkin
i
feel
quite
sure
miss
moxey
undoubtedly
it
was
peak
buckland
warricombe
who
had
been
waiting
for
a
chance
of
escape
suddenly
wore
a
look
of
interest
he
rapidly
surveyed
the
trio
christian
somewhat
out
of
countenance
tried
to
answer
malkin
in
a
tone
of
light
banter
happens
my
dear
fellow
that
peak
has
not
left
england
since
we
lost
sight
of
him
he
has
been
heard
of
where
is
he
then
warricombe
can
assure
you
that
he
has
been
living
for
a
year
at
exeter
buckland
perceiving
that
he
had
at
length
come
upon
something
important
to
his
purposes
smiled
genially
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
peak
down
in
devon
from
time
to
time
it
was
really
an
illusion
cried
malkin
was
too
hasty
yet
that
is
a
charge
that
can
be
often
brought
against
me
i
think
does
earwaker
know
of
this
has
lately
heard
replied
christian
who
in
vain
sought
for
a
means
of
checking
malkin
loquacity
thought
he
might
have
told
you
not
the
thing
is
quite
new
to
me
and
what
is
peak
doing
down
there
pray
why
did
he
conceal
himself
christian
gazed
appealingly
at
his
sister
she
returned
the
look
steadily
but
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
it
was
warricombe
voice
that
next
sounded
behaviour
seems
mysterious
he
began
with
ironic
gravity
do
pretend
to
understand
him
what
your
view
of
his
character
mr
malkin
know
him
very
slightly
indeed
warricombe
but
i
have
a
high
opinion
of
his
powers
i
wonder
he
does
so
little
after
that
article
of
his
in
malkin
became
aware
of
something
like
agonised
entreaty
on
countenance
but
this
had
merely
the
effect
of
heightening
his
curiosity
said
warricombe
eagerly
did
know
of
that
what
was
the
subject
be
sure
it
was
anonymous
went
on
malkin
without
a
suspicion
of
the
part
he
was
playing
before
these
three
excited
people
paper
called
the
new
sophistry
a
tremendous
bit
of
satire
marcella
eyes
closed
as
if
a
light
had
flashed
before
them
she
drew
a
short
sigh
and
at
once
seemed
to
become
quite
at
ease
the
smile
with
which
she
regarded
warricombe
expressing
a
calm
interest
article
was
peak
buckland
asked
in
a
very
quiet
voice
christian
at
last
found
his
opportunity
never
mentioned
it
to
you
perhaps
he
thought
he
had
gone
rather
too
far
in
his
broad
churchism
and
might
be
misunderstood
churchism
cried
malkin
broad
i
must
say
and
he
laughed
heartily
marcella
seemed
to
join
in
his
mirth
it
would
surprise
you
said
buckland
in
the
same
quiet
tone
as
before
hear
that
peak
is
about
to
take
orders
for
what
christian
laughed
the
worst
was
over
after
all
it
came
as
a
relief
for
wines
he
replied
warricombe
means
that
peak
is
going
to
be
ordained
malkin
amazement
rendered
him
speechless
he
stared
from
one
person
to
another
his
features
strangely
distorted
can
hardly
believe
it
pressed
buckland
the
reply
was
anticipated
by
christian
saying
malkin
that
you
had
no
opportunity
of
studying
peak
not
so
easy
to
understand
him
i
do
see
burst
out
the
other
i
could
possibly
so
him
what
has
earwaker
to
say
buckland
rose
from
his
seat
advanced
to
marcella
and
offered
his
hand
she
said
mechanically
you
go
but
was
incapable
of
another
word
christian
came
to
her
relief
performed
the
needful
civilities
and
accompanied
his
acquaintance
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
buckland
had
become
grave
stiff
monosyllabic
christian
made
no
allusion
to
the
scene
thus
suddenly
interrupted
and
they
parted
with
a
formal
air
malkin
remained
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
muteness
of
his
companions
made
it
plain
to
him
that
he
had
better
withdraw
he
went
off
with
a
sense
of
having
been
mystified
half
resentful
and
vastly
impatient
to
see
earwaker

i
the
cuckoo
clock
in
mrs
roots
kitchen
had
just
struck
three
a
wind
roared
from
the
and
light
thickened
beneath
a
sky
which
made
threat
of
snow
peak
was
in
a
mood
to
enjoy
the
crackling
fire
he
settled
himself
with
a
book
in
his
and
thought
with
pleasure
of
two
hours
reading
before
the
appearance
of
the
homely
teapot
christmas
was
just
over
one
cause
of
the
feeling
of
relief
and
quietness
which
possessed
him
no
one
had
invited
him
for
christmas
eve
or
the
day
that
followed
and
he
did
not
regret
it
the
letter
he
had
received
from
martin
warricombe
was
assurance
enough
that
those
he
desired
to
remember
him
still
did
so
he
had
thought
of
using
this
season
for
his
long
postponed
visit
to
twybridge
but
reluctance
prevailed
all
popular
holidays
irritated
and
depressed
him
he
loathed
the
spectacle
of
multitudes
in
sunday
garb
it
was
all
over
and
the
sense
of
that
afforded
him
a
brief
content
this
book
which
he
had
just
brought
from
the
circulating
library
was
altogether
to
his
taste
the
author
justin
walsh
he
knew
to
be
a
brother
of
professor
walsh
long
ago
the
object
of
his
rebellious
admiration
matter
and
treatment
rejoiced
him
no
intellectual
delight
though
he
was
capable
of
it
in
many
forms
so
stirred
his
spirit
as
that
afforded
him
by
a
vigorous
modern
writer
joyously
assailing
the
old
moralities
justin
walsh
was
a
modern
of
the
moderns
at
once
man
of
science
and
man
of
letters
defiant
without
a
hint
of
popular
cynicism
scornful

reticences

stood
by
way
of
motto
on

and
godwin
felt
his
nerves
thrill
in
sympathetic
response
what
a
fine
fellow
he
must
be
to
have
for
a
friend
now
a
man
like
this
surely
had
companionship
enough
and
of
the
kind
he
wished
he
wrote
like
one
who
associates
freely
with
the
educated
classes
both
at
home
and
abroad
was
he
married
where
would
seek
his
wife
the
fitting
mate
for
him
would
doubtless
be
found
among
those
women
cosmopolitan
and
emancipated
whose
acquaintance
falls
only
to
men
in
easy
circumstances
and
of
good
social
standing

who
travel
much
who
are
at

the

fell
upon
his
knee
had
it
not
lain
in
his
own
power
to
win
a
reputation
like
that
which
justin
walsh
was
achieving
his
paper
in
critical
itself
a
decided
success
might
have
been
followed
up
by
others
of
the
same
tenor
instead
of
mouldering
in
a
dull
cathedral
town
he
might
now
be
living
and
working
in
france
or
germany
his
money
would
have
served
one
purpose
as
well
as

three

determined
effort

her
face
at

gentleman

asking
for
you
sir
mr
chilvers
chilvers
please
ask
him
to
come
up
he
threw
his
book
on
to
the
table
and
stood
in
expectancy
someone
ascended
the
stairs
with
rapid
stride
and
creaking
boots
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
cordial
but
affected
voice
burst
forth
in
greeting
mr
peak
i
hope
you
have
altogether
forgotten
me
delighted
to
see
you
again
godwin
gave
his
hand
and
felt
it
strongly
pressed
whilst
chilvers
gazed
into
his
face
with
a
smiling
wistfulness
which
could
only
be
answered
with
a
grin
of
discomfort
the
rev
bruno
had
grown
very
tall
and
seemed
to
be
in
perfect
health
but
the
effeminacy
of
his
brilliant
youth
still
declared
itself
in
his
attitudes
gestures
and
attire
he
was
dressed
with
marked
avoidance
of
the
professional
pattern
a
hat
of
soft
felt
but
not
clerical
fashionable
collar
and
tie
a
sweeping
ulster
and
beneath
it
a
which
was
doubtless
the
pride
of
some
west
end
tailor
his
boots
were
dandiacally
diminutive
his
glove
fitted
like
that
of
a
lady
who
lives
but
to
be
the
feathery
hair
which
at
whitelaw
he
was
wont
to
pat
and
smooth
still
had
its
golden
shimmer
and
on
his
face
no
growth
was
permitted
had
heard
of
your
arrival
here
of
course
said
peak
trying
to
appear
civil
though
anything
more
than
that
was
beyond
his
power
you
sit
down
is
the
breathing
time
o
the
day
with
you
i
hope
i
disturb
your
work
was
only
reading
this
book
of
walsh
do
you
know
it
but
for
some
such
relief
of
his
feelings
godwin
could
not
have
sat
still
there
was
a
pleasure
in
uttering
walsh
name
moreover
it
would
serve
as
a
test
of
chilvers
disposition
he
took
up
the
volume
justin
walsh
i
know
him
a
wonderful
book
admirable
dialectic
delicious
style
quite
orthodox
i
fancy
replied
godwin
with
a
curling
of
the
lips
oh
of
course
not
of
course
not
but
a
rich
vein
of
humanity
do
you
find
that
pray
allow
me
to
throw
off
my
overcoat
ha
thanks
a
rich
vein
of
humanity
walsh
is
by
no
means
to
be
confused
with
the
nullifidians
a
very
man
at
bottom
the
truest
of
christians
now
and
then
he
effervesces
rather
too
exuberantly
yes
i
admit
it
in
a
review
of
his
last
book
which
i
was
privileged
to
write
for
one
of
our
papers
i
ventured
to
urge
upon
him
the
necessity
of
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
new
work
he
exhibits
more
an
approach
to
the
serene
fortitude
which
i
trust
he
may
attain
a
man
of
the
broadest
brotherliness
a
most
valuable
ally
of
renascent
christianity
peak
was
hardly
prepared
for
this
strain
he
knew
that
chilvers
prided
himself
on
but
as
yet
he
had
enjoyed
no
intercourse
with
the
broadest
school
of
anglicans
and
was
uncertain
as
to
the
limits
of
modern
latitudinarianism
the
discovery
of
such
fantastic
liberality
in
a
man
whom
he
could
not
but
dislike
and
contemn
gave
him
no
pleasure
but
at
least
it
disposed
him
to
amusement
rather
than
antagonism
chilvers
pronunciation
and
phraseology
were
distinguished
by
such
original
affectation
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
find
entertainment
in
listening
to
him
though
his
voice
was
naturally
thin
and
piping
he
managed
to
speak
in
head
notes
which
had
a
ring
of
robust
utterance
the
sound
of
his
words
was
intended
to
correspond
with
their
virile
warmth
of
meaning
in
the
same
way
he
had
cultivated
a
habit
of
the
muscles
which
conveyed
an
impression
that
he
was
devoted
to
athletic
sports
his
arms
occasionally
swung
as
if
brandishing
his
chest
now
and
then
spread
itself
to
the
uttermost
and
his
head
was
often
thrown
back
in
an
attitude
suggesting
you
are
about
to
join
us
he
exclaimed
with
a
look
of
touching
interest
much
like
that
of
a
ladies
doctor
speaking
delicately
of
favourable
symptoms
then
as
if
consciously
returning
to
the
virile
note
think
we
shall
understand
each
other
i
am
always
eager
to
study
the
opinions
of
those
among
us
who
have
scientific
minds
i
hear
of
you
on
all
hands
already
you
have
strongly
impressed
some
of
the
thinking
people
in
exeter
peak
crossed
his
legs
and
made
no
reply
is
distinct
need
of
an
infusion
of
the
scientific
spirit
into
the
work
of
the
church
the
churchman
hitherto
has
been
as
a
matter
of
course
of
the
literary
stamp
hence
much
of
our
trouble
during
the
last
it
behoves
us
to
go
in
for
science
physical
economic
science
of
every
kind
only
thus
can
we
resist
the
morbific
influences
which
inevitably
beset
an
established
church
in
times
such
as
these
i
say
it
boldly
let
us
throw
aside
our
hebrew
and
our
greek
our
commentators
ancient
and
modern
let
us
have
done
with
polemics
and
with
compromises
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
construct
a
spiritual
edifice
on
the
basis
of
scientific
revelation
i
use
the
word
revelation
advisedly
the
results
of
science
are
the
divine
message
to
our
age
to
neglect
them
to
fear
them
is
to
remain
under
the
old
law
whilst
the
new
is
demanding
our
adherence
to
repeat
the
jewish
error
of
bygone
time
less
of
st
paul
and
more
of
darwin
less
of
luther
and
more
of
herbert
spencer
i
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
this
doctrine
at
st
margaret
peak
inquired
a
form
suitable
to
the
intelligence
of
my
parishioners
taken
in
the
mass
were
my
hands
perfectly
free
i
should
begin
by
preaching
a
series
of
sermons
on
origin
of
sermons
an
obnoxious
word
one
ought
never
to
use
it
it
signifies
everything
inept
inert
it
your
serious
belief
then
that
the
mass
of
parishioners
here
or
elsewhere
are
ready
for
this
form
of
spiritual
instruction
distinctly
given
the
true
capacity
in
the
teacher
mark
me
i
do
say
that
they
are
capable
of
receiving
much
absolute
knowledge
what
i
desire
is
that
their
minds
shall
be
relieved
from
a
state
of
harassing
conflict
put
at
the
right
point
of
view
they
are
not
to
think
that
jesus
of
nazareth
teaches
faith
and
conduct
incompatible
with
the
doctrines
of
evolutionism
they
are
not
to
spend
their
lives
in
kicking
against
the
pricks
and
regard
as
meritorious
the
punctures
which
result
to
them
the
establishment
in
their
minds
of
a
few
cardinal
facts
that
is
the
first
step
then
let
the
interpretation
follow
the
solace
the
encouragement
the
hope
for
eternity
imagine
said
godwin
with
a
calm
air
the
mind
of
the
average
is
seriously
disturbed
on
questions
of
faith
can
you
ignore
it
my
dear
peak
permit
me
this
familiarity
we
are
old
the
average
churchgoer
is
the
average
citizen
of
our
english
commonwealth
a
man
necessarily
aware
of
the
great
radical
movement
and
all
that
it
involves
forgive
me
there
has
been
far
too
much
blinking
of
actualities
by
zealous
christians
whose
faith
is
rooted
in
knowledge
we
gain
nothing
by
it
we
lose
immensely
let
us
recognise
that
our
churches
are
filled
with
sceptics
endeavouring
to
believe
in
spite
of
themselves
experience
is
much
larger
than
mine
remarked
the
listener
submissively
i
have
widely
studied
the
subject
chilvers
smiled
with
ineffable
his
head
twisted
like
that
of
a
sagacious
parrot
your
average
citizen
said
the
other
about
the
average
citizeness
the
female
are
not
insignificant
in
number
there
we
reach
the
core
of
the
matter
woman
woman
precisely
is
the
most
hopeful
outlook
i
trust
you
are
strong
for
female
emancipation
perfectly
sound
on
that
question
be
sure
then
it
must
be
obvious
to
you
that
women
are
destined
to
play
the
leading
part
in
our
christian
renascence
precisely
as
they
did
in
the
original
spreading
of
the
faith
what
else
is
the
meaning
of
the
vast
activity
in
female
education
let
them
be
taught
and
forthwith
they
will
rally
to
our
broad
church
a
man
may
be
content
to
remain
a
nullifidian
women
can
not
rest
at
that
stage
they
demand
the
spiritual
significance
of
i
grieve
to
tell
you
peak
that
for
three
years
i
have
been
a
widower
my
wife
died
with
shocking
suddenness
leaving
me
her
two
little
children
ah
but
leaving
me
also
the
memory
of
a
singularly
pure
and
noble
being
i
may
say
with
all
humility
that
i
have
studied
the
female
mind
in
its
noblest
modern
type
i
what
can
be
expected
of
woman
in
our
day
and
in
the
future
chilvers
was
in
full
sympathy
with
your
views
years
ago
i
had
not
yet
reached
my
present
standpoint
in
several
directions
i
was
still
narrow
but
her
prime
characteristic
was
the
tendency
to
spiritual
growth
she
would
have
accompanied
me
step
by
step
in
very
many
respects
i
must
regard
myself
as
a
man
favoured
by
fortune
i
know
it
and
i
trust
i
am
grateful
for
it
but
that
loss
my
dear
peak
counterbalances
much
happiness
in
moments
of
repose
when
i
look
back
on
work
joyously
achieved
i
often
murmur
to
myself
with
a
sudden
sigh

he
pronounced
his
latin
in
the
way
with
continental
vowels
the
effect
of
this
on
an
englishman
lips
is
always
more
or
less
pedantic
and
in
his
case
it
was
intolerable
when
he
exclaimed
dismissing
the
melancholy
thought
you
present
yourself
for
ordination
it
was
his
habit
to
pay
slight
attention
to
the
words
of
anyone
but
himself
and
peak
careless
answer
merely
led
him
to
talk
on
wide
subjects
with
renewal
of
energy
one
might
have
suspected
that
he
had
made
a
list
of
uncommon
words
wherewith
to
adorn
his
discourse
for
certain
of
these
frequently
recurred
were
among
his
favourites
once
or
twice
he
spoke
of
with
an
emphatic
enunciation
which
seemed
to
invite
respectful
wonder
in
using
latin
words
which
have
become
fixed
in
the
english
language
he
generally
corrected
the
common
errors
of
quantity
the
spiritual
fervour
as
his
when
he
referred
to
christian
teachers
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
they
were
seldom
or
never
members
of
the
church
of
england
methodists
romanists
presbyterians
appeared
to
stand
high
in
his
favour
and
peak
readily
discerned
that
this
was
a
way
of
displaying
tolerance
it
was
his
foible
to
quote
foreign
languages
especially
passages
which
came
from
heretical
authors
thus
he
began
to
talk
of
feuerbach
for
the
sole
purpose
of
delivering
a
german
sentence
has
been
of
infinite
value
to
me
quite
infinite
value
you
remember
his
definition
of
god
it
is
constantly
in
my
mind

of

mr
lilywhite
admirable
fellow
broad
of
sympathies
has
distinctly
the
scientific
turn
of

peak
smiled
knowing
the
truth
but
he
had
hit
upon
a
way
of
meeting
the
rev
bruno
which
promised
greatly
to
diminish
the
suffering
inherent
in
the
situation
he
would
use
the
man
deliberately
for
his
mirth
chilvers
lent
itself
to
persiflage
and
by
indulging
in
that
mood
godwin
tasted
some
compensation
for
the
part
he
had
to
play
i
believe
you
know
the
warricombes
very
well
pursued
chilvers
i
hope
to
see
much
of
them
they
are
people
after
my
own
heart
long
ago
i
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
them
i
hear
we
sha
see
them
till
the
summer
believe
not
warricombe
is
a
great
geologist
i
think
probably
he
frequents
public
worship
as
a
mere
tribute
to
social
opinion
he
asked
the
question
in
the
airiest
possible
way
as
if
it
mattered
nothing
to
him
what
the
reply
might
be
warricombe
is
a
man
of
sincere
piety
godwin
answered
with
grave
countenance
by
no
means
necessitates
my
dear
peak
rejoined
the
other
waving
his
hand
think
not
i
am
still
only
a
student
you
must
remember
my
mind
is
in
suspense
on
not
a
few
points
course
of
course
pray
let
me
give
you
the
results
of
my
own
thought
on
this
subject
he
proceeded
to
do
so
at
some
length
when
he
had
rounded
his
last
period
he
unexpectedly
started
up
swung
on
his
toes
spread
his
chest
drew
a
deep
breath
and
with
the
sweetest
of
smiles
announced
that
he
must
postpone
the
delight
of
further
conversation
must
come
and
dine
with
me
as
soon
as
my
house
is
in
reasonable
order
as
yet
everything
is
delightful
old
city
exeter
charming
charming
and
on
the
moment
he
was
gone
what
were
this
man
real
opinions
he
had
brains
and
literature
his
pose
before
the
world
was
not
that
of
an
ignorant
charlatan
vanity
no
doubt
was
his
prime
motive
but
did
it
operate
to
make
a
cleric
of
a
secret
materialist
or
to
incite
a
display
of
excessive
liberalism
in
one
whose
convictions
were
orthodox
godwin
could
not
answer
to
his
satisfaction
but
he
preferred
the
latter
surmise
one
thing
however
became
clear
to
him
all
his
conscientious
scruples
about
entering
the
church
were
superfluous
chilvers
would
have
smiled
pityingly
at
anyone
who
disputed
his
right
to
live
by
the
establishment
and
to
stand
up
as
an
authorised
preacher
of
the
national
faith
and
beyond
a
doubt
he
regulated
his
degree
of
by
standards
familiar
to
him
in
professional
intercourse
to
him
it
seemed
to
preach
a
gospel
of
moral
progress
of
intellectual
growth
of
universal
fraternity
if
this
were
the
tendency
of
anglicanism
then
almost
any
man
who
desired
to
live
a
cleanly
life
and
to
see
others
do
the
same
might
without
hesitation
become
a
clergyman
the
old
formulae
of
subscription
were
so
symbolised
so
volatilised
that
they
could
not
stand
in
the
way
of
anyone
but
a
combative
nihilist
peak
was
conscious
of
positive
ideals
by
no
means
inconsistent
with
christian
teaching
and
in
his
official
capacity
these
alone
would
direct
him
he
spent
his
evening
pleasantly
often
laughing
as
he
recalled
a
phrase
or
gesture
of
the
rev
bruno
in
the
night
fell
a
sprinkling
of
snow
and
when
the
sun
rose
it
gleamed
from
a
sky
of
pale
frosty
blue
at
ten
godwin
set
out
for
his
usual
walk
choosing
the
direction
of
the
old
tiverton
road
it
was
a
fortnight
since
he
had
passed
the
warricombes
house
at
present
he
was
disposed
to
indulge
the
thoughts
which
a
sight
of
it
would
make
active
he
had
begun
the
ascent
of
the
hill
when
the
sound
of
an
approaching
vehicle
caused
him
to
raise
his
eyes
they
were
generally
fixed
on
the
ground
when
he
walked
alone
it
was
only
a
hired
fly
but
as
it
passed
him
he
recognised
the
face
he
had
least
expected
to
see
sidwell
warricombe
sat
in
the
carriage
and
unaccompanied
she
noticed
him
smiled
and
bent
forward
he
clutched
at
his
hat
but
it
happened
that
the
driver
had
turned
to
look
at
him
and
instead
of
the
salute
he
had
intended
his
hand
waved
to
the
man
to
stop
the
gesture
was
scarcely
voluntary
when
he
saw
the
carriage
pull
up
his
heart
sank
he
felt
guilty
of
monstrous
impudence
but
sidwell
face
appeared
at
the
window
and
its
expression
was
anything
but
resentful
she
offered
her
hand
too
without
preface
of
formal
phrase
he
exclaimed
delightful
to
see
you
so
unexpectedly
are
you
all
here
mother
and
i
we
have
come
for
a
day
or
two
you
allow
me
to
call
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
shall
be
at
home
this
afternoon
you
do
you
enjoy
the
sunshine
after
london
i
do
he
stepped
back
and
signed
to
the
driver
sidwell
bent
her
head
and
was
out
of
sight
but
the
carriage
was
visible
for
some
distance
and
even
when
he
could
no
longer
see
it
he
heard
the
horse
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
long
after
the
last
sound
had
died
away
his
heart
continued
to
beat
painfully
and
he
breathed
as
if
recovering
from
a
hard
run
how
beautiful
were
these
lanes
and
hills
even
in
once
more
he
sang
aloud
in
his
joyous
solitude
the
hope
he
had
nourished
was
not
unreasonable
his
boldness
justified
itself
yes
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
succeed
and
the
life
before
him
would
be
richer
for
all
the
mistakes
and
miseries
through
which
he
had
passed
thirty
forty
fifty
why
twenty
years
hence
he
would
be
in
the
prime
of
manhood
with
perhaps
yet
another
twenty
years
of
mental
and
bodily
vigour
one
of
the
men
who
succeed
chapter
ii
on
the
morning
after
her
journey
down
from
london
warricombe
awoke
with
the
conviction
that
she
had
caught
a
cold
her
health
was
in
general
excellent
and
she
had
no
disposition
to
nurse
imaginary
ailments
but
when
some
slight
disorder
broke
the
routine
of
her
life
she
made
the
most
of
it
enjoying
much
as
children
do
the
importance
with
which
for
the
time
it
invested
her
at
such
seasons
she
was
wont
to
regard
herself
with
a
mildly
despondent
compassion
to
feel
that
her
family
and
her
friends
held
her
of
slight
account
she
spoke
in
a
tone
of
conscious
resignation
often
with
a
forgiving
smile
when
the
girls
redoubled
their
attentions
and
soothed
her
with
gentle
words
she
would
close
her
eyes
and
sigh
seeming
to
remind
them
that
they
would
know
her
value
when
she
was
no
more
are
hoarse
mother
sidwell
said
to
her
when
they
met
at
breakfast
i
dear
you
know
i
felt
rather
afraid
of
the
journey
i
hope
i
sha
be
laid
up
sidwell
advised
her
not
to
leave
the
house
having
seen
the
invalid
comfortably
established
in
an
upper
room
she
went
into
the
city
on
business
which
could
not
be
delayed
on
her
way
occurred
the
meeting
with
peak
but
of
this
on
her
return
she
made
no
mention
mother
and
daughter
had
luncheon
upstairs
and
sidwell
was
full
of
affectionate
solicitude
afternoon
you
had
better
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
she
said
you
think
so
just
drop
a
line
to
father
and
warn
him
that
we
may
kept
here
for
some
time
i
send
for
dr
endacott
as
you
like
dear
but
warricombe
had
eaten
such
an
excellent
lunch
that
sidwell
could
not
feel
uneasy
see
how
you
are
this
evening
at
all
events
it
will
be
safer
for
you
not
to
go
downstairs
if
you
lie
quiet
for
an
hour
or
two
i
can
look
for
those
pamphlets
that
father
wants
as
you
like
dear
by
three
the
invalid
was
calmly
slumbering
having
entered
the
bedroom
on
tiptoe
and
heard
regular
breathing
sidwell
went
down
and
for
a
few
minutes
lingered
about
the
hall
a
servant
came
to
her
for
instructions
on
some
domestic
matter
when
this
was
dismissed
she
mentioned
that
if
anyone
called
she
would
be
found
in
the
library
the
pamphlets
of
which
her
father
had
spoken
were
soon
discovered
she
laid
them
aside
and
seated
herself
by
the
fire
but
without
leaning
back
at
any
sound
within
or
outside
the
house
she
moved
her
head
to
listen
her
look
was
anxious
but
the
gleam
of
her
eyes
expressed
pleasurable
agitation
at
three
she
went
into
the
where
all
the
furniture
was
draped
and
the
floor
bare
standing
where
she
could
look
from
a
distance
through
one
of
the
windows
at
which
the
blind
had
been
raised
she
waited
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
the
chill
atmosphere
drove
her
back
to
the
fireside
in
the
study
evidences
of
temporary
desertion
were
less
oppressive
but
the
windows
looked
only
upon
a
sequestered
part
of
the
garden
sidwell
desired
to
watch
the
approach
from
the
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
again
in
the
but
scarcely
had
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
when
a
ringing
of
the
visitors
bell
sounded
with
unfamiliar
distinctness
she
started
hastened
from
the
room
fled
into
the
library
and
had
time
to
seat
herself
before
she
heard
the
footsteps
of
a
servant
moving
in
answer
to
the
summons
the
door
opened
and
peak
was
announced
sidwell
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
thus
overcome
with
emotion
shame
at
her
inability
to
command
the
calm
features
with
which
she
would
naturally
receive
a
caller
flushed
her
cheeks
and
neck
she
stepped
forward
with
downcast
eyes
and
only
in
offering
her
hand
could
at
length
look
at
him
who
stood
before
her
she
saw
at
once
that
peak
was
unlike
himself
he
too
had
unusual
warmth
in
his
countenance
and
his
eyes
seemed
strangely
large
luminous
on
his
forehead
were
drops
of
moisture
this
sight
restored
her
or
such
measure
of
it
as
permitted
her
to
speak
in
the
conventional
way
am
sorry
that
mother
ca
leave
her
room
she
had
a
slight
cold
this
morning
but
i
did
think
it
would
give
her
any
trouble
peak
was
delighted
and
betrayed
the
feeling
even
whilst
he
constrained
his
face
into
a
look
of
exaggerated
anxiety
wo
be
anything
serious
i
hope
the
railway
journey
i
afraid
the
journey
she
has
a
slight
hoarseness
but
i
think
we
shall
prevent
it
from
their
eyes
kept
meeting
and
with
more
steadfastness
they
were
conscious
of
mutual
scrutiny
and
on
both
sides
of
changes
since
they
last
met
when
two
people
have
devoted
intense
study
to
each
features
a
three
months
absence
not
only
revives
the
old
impressions
but
subjects
them
to
sudden
modification
which
engrosses
thought
and
feeling
sidwell
continued
to
utter
commonplaces
simply
as
a
means
of
disguising
the
thoughts
that
occupied
her
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
peak
face
had
a
purer
outline
than
she
had
believed
and
that
his
eyes
had
gained
in
expressiveness
in
the
same
way
godwin
said
and
replied
he
knew
not
what
just
to
give
himself
time
to
observe
and
enjoy
the
something
new
the
increased
animation
or
subtler
facial
movements
which
struck
him
as
often
as
he
looked
at
his
companion
each
wondered
what
the
other
had
been
doing
whether
the
time
had
seemed
long
or
short
hope
you
have
kept
well
sidwell
asked
godwin
hastened
to
respond
with
civil
inquiries
was
very
glad
to
hear
from
warricombe
a
few
days
ago
he
continued
sidwell
was
not
aware
that
her
father
had
written
but
her
pleased
smile
seemed
to
signify
the
contrary
looks
younger
peak
said
in
his
mind
that
london
dress
and
the
new
way
of
arranging
her
hair
have
something
to
do
with
it
but
no
she
looks
younger
in
herself
she
must
have
been
enjoying
the
pleasures
of
town
have
been
constantly
occupied
no
doubt
he
added
aloud
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
this
was
a
clumsy
expression
of
what
he
meant
though
he
had
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
and
seated
himself
as
easily
as
he
could
the
absurd
tall
hat
which
he
held
embarrassed
him
to
deposit
it
on
the
floor
demanded
an
effort
of
which
he
was
yet
incapable
have
seen
many
things
and
heard
much
talk
sidwell
was
replying
in
a
gay
tone
it
irritated
him
he
would
have
preferred
her
to
speak
with
more
of
the
old
pensiveness
yet
perhaps
she
was
glad
simply
because
she
found
herself
again
talking
with
him
you
she
went
on
has
not
been
all
work
i
hope
no
i
have
had
many
pleasant
intervals
this
was
in
imitation
of
her
vivacity
he
felt
the
words
and
the
manner
to
be
ridiculous
but
could
not
restrain
himself
every
moment
increased
his
uneasiness
the
hat
weighed
in
his
hands
like
a
lump
of
lead
and
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
never
looked
so
clownish
did
her
smile
signify
criticism
of
his
attitude
with
a
decision
which
came
he
knew
not
how
he
let
his
hat
drop
to
the
floor
and
pushed
it
aside
there
that
was
better
he
felt
less
of
a
bumpkin
sidwell
glanced
at
the
glossy
grotesque
but
instantly
averted
her
eyes
and
asked
rather
more
gravely
you
been
in
exeter
all
the
time
you
did
spend
your
christmas
alone
i
hope
i
had
my
books
was
there
not
a
touch
of
natural
pathos
in
this
he
hoped
so
then
mocked
at
himself
for
calculating
such
effects
think
you
do
care
much
for
ordinary
social
pleasures
mr
peak
he
smiled
bitterly
have
never
known
much
of
them
and
you
remember
that
i
look
forward
to
a
life
in
which
they
will
have
little
part
such
a
life
he
continued
after
a
pause
to
you
unendurably
dull
i
noticed
that
when
i
spoke
of
it
before
misunderstood
me
she
said
it
so
undecidedly
that
he
gazed
at
her
with
puzzled
look
her
eyes
fell
you
like
society
you
use
the
word
in
its
narrowest
meaning
she
answered
i
not
only
dislike
society
but
despise
it
she
had
raised
her
eyebrows
and
was
looking
coldly
at
him
did
she
mean
to
rebuke
him
for
the
tone
he
had
adopted
indeed
he
seemed
to
himself
presumptuous
but
if
they
were
still
on
terms
such
as
these
was
it
not
better
to
know
it
even
at
the
cost
of
humiliation
one
moment
he
believed
that
he
could
read
sidwell
thoughts
and
that
they
were
wholly
favourable
to
him
at
another
he
felt
absolutely
ignorant
of
all
that
was
passing
in
her
and
disposed
to
interpret
her
face
as
that
of
a
conventional
woman
who
had
never
regarded
him
as
on
her
own
social
plane
these
uncertainties
these
frequent
reversions
to
a
state
of
mind
which
at
other
times
he
seemed
to
have
long
outgrown
were
a
singular
feature
of
his
relations
with
sidwell
could
such
experiences
consist
with
genuine
love
never
had
he
felt
more
willing
to
answer
the
question
with
a
negative
he
felt
that
he
was
come
here
to
act
a
part
and
that
the
end
of
the
interview
be
it
what
it
might
would
only
affect
him
superficially
he
replied
with
deliberation
never
supposed
that
you
had
any
interest
in
the
most
foolish
class
of
wealthy
people
i
meant
that
you
recognise
your
place
in
a
certain
social
rank
and
regard
intercourse
with
your
equals
as
an
essential
of
happiness
i
understood
why
you
ask
she
began
abruptly
but
ceased
as
she
met
his
glance
again
he
thought
she
was
asserting
a
distant
dignity
question
arose
naturally
out
of
a
train
of
thought
which
always
occupies
me
when
i
talk
with
you
i
myself
belong
to
no
class
whatever
and
i
ca
help
wondering
how
if
the
subject
ever
occurred
to
you
you
would
place
me
he
saw
his
way
now
and
having
said
thus
much
could
talk
on
defiantly
this
hour
must
decide
his
fortune
with
sidwell
yet
his
tongue
utterly
refused
any
of
the
modes
of
speech
which
the
situation
would
have
suggested
to
an
ordinary
mind
he
could
not
love
instead
of
humility
he
was
prompted
to
display
a
rough
arrogance
instead
of
tender
phrases
he
uttered
what
sounded
like
deliberate
rudeness
his
voice
was
less
gently
tuned
than
sidwell
had
been
wont
to
hear
it
it
all
meant
that
he
despaired
of
wooing
successfully
and
more
than
half
wished
to
force
some
word
from
sidwell
which
would
spare
him
the
necessity
of
a
plain
avowal
but
before
he
had
finished
speaking
her
face
changed
a
light
of
sudden
understanding
shone
in
her
eyes
her
lips
softened
to
a
smile
of
exquisite
gentleness
subject
never
occur
to
me
she
answered
should
it
a
friend
is
a
friend
it
was
not
strictly
true
but
in
the
strength
of
her
emotion
she
could
forget
all
that
contradicted
it
friend
yes
godwin
began
with
the
same
note
of
bluntness
but
of
a
sudden
he
felt
the
influence
of
sidwell
smile
his
voice
sank
into
a
murmur
his
heart
leapt
a
thrill
went
through
his
veins
wish
to
be
something
more
than
a
friend
he
felt
that
it
was
bald
inadequate
yet
the
words
had
come
of
their
own
accord
on
an
impulse
of
unimpaired
sincerity
sidwell
head
was
bent
is
why
i
ca
take
simple
things
for
granted
he
continued
his
gaze
fixed
upon
her
i
thought
of
nothing
but
friendship
it
would
seem
rational
enough
that
you
should
accept
me
for
what
i
am
a
man
of
education
talking
your
own
language
because
i
have
dared
to
hope
something
more
i
suffer
from
the
thought
that
i
was
not
born
into
your
world
and
that
you
must
be
always
remembering
this
difference
you
think
me
so
far
behind
the
age
asked
sidwell
trying
to
laugh
are
getting
mixed
confused
yes
but
we
are
so
conscious
of
the
process
that
we
talk
of
class
distinctions
more
than
of
anything
else
talk
and
think
of
them
incessantly
you
have
never
heard
me
make
a
profession
of
radicalism
am
decidedly
behind
the
age
be
what
i
may
and
i
have
spiritual
pride
more
than
enough
the
fact
that
i
have
relatives
in
the
lower
even
the
lowest
social
class
must
necessarily
affect
the
whole
course
of
my
life
a
certain
kind
of
man
declares
himself
proud
of
such
an
origin
and
most
often
lies
or
one
may
be
driven
by
it
into
rebellion
against
social
privilege
to
me
my
origin
is
simply
a
grave
misfortune
to
be
accepted
and
if
possible
overcome
does
that
sound
i
ca
help
it
i
want
you
to
know
me
believe
i
know
you
very
well
sidwell
replied
the
consciousness
that
she
was
deceived
checked
the
words
which
were
rising
to
his
lips
again
he
saw
himself
in
a
pitiful
light
and
this
reflected
upon
sidwell
he
could
not
doubt
that
she
was
yielding
to
him
her
attitude
and
her
voice
declared
it
but
what
was
the
value
of
love
won
by
imposture
why
had
she
not
intelligence
enough
to
see
through
his
hypocrisy
which
at
times
was
so
thin
a
veil
how
defective
must
her
sympathy
be
you
have
seen
very
little
of
me
he
said
smiling
there
was
a
short
silence
then
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
emotion
i
wish
we
had
known
each
other
ever
since
that
day
when
your
brother
brought
me
to
your
house
near
kingsmill
if
we
had
met
and
talked
through
all
those
years
but
that
was
impossible
for
the
very
reason
which
makes
me
inarticulate
now
that
i
wish
to
say
so
much
when
you
first
saw
me
i
was
a
gawky
schoolboy
learning
to
use
my
brains
and
knowing
already
that
life
had
nothing
to
offer
me
but
a
false
position
whether
i
remained
with
my
kith
and
kin
or
turned
my
back
upon
them
in
the
hope
of
finding
my
equals
i
was
condemned
to
a
life
of
miserable
incompleteness
i
was
born
in
exile
it
took
a
long
time
before
i
had
taught
myself
how
to
move
and
speak
like
one
of
the
class
to
which
i
belonged
by
right
of
intellect
i
was
living
alone
in
london
in
mean
but
the
day
came
when
i
felt
more
confidence
in
myself
i
had
saved
money
and
foresaw
that
in
a
year
or
two
i
should
be
able
to
carry
out
a
plan
make
one
serious
attempt
to
win
a
position
among
educated
people
he
stopped
had
he
intended
a
full
confession
it
was
thus
he
might
have
begun
it
sidwell
was
regarding
him
but
with
a
gentle
look
utterly
unsuspecting
she
was
unable
to
realise
his
character
and
his
temptations
have
you
not
succeeded
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
i
let
me
put
it
to
the
test
i
will
set
aside
every
thought
of
presumption
forget
that
i
am
a
penniless
student
looking
forward
to
a
country
curacy
and
say
what
i
wished
to
when
we
had
our
last
conversation
never
mind
how
it
sounds
i
have
dared
to
hope
that
some
day
i
shall
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
and
that
you
wo
refuse
the
word
reverberated
on
his
ears
a
whirl
of
emotion
broke
the
defiant
calm
he
had
supported
for
the
last
few
minutes
the
silence
seemed
to
be
endless
when
he
looked
at
sidwell
her
head
was
bent
the
eyes
concealed
by
their
drooping
lids
her
expression
was
very
grave
a
piece
of
recklessness
he
said
at
length
no
answer
sidwell
raised
her
eyes
and
spoke
gently
with
voice
a
little
shaken
should
you
call
it
recklessness
i
have
never
thought
of
the
things
that
seem
to
trouble
you
so
much
you
were
a
friend
of
ours
was
that
enough
it
seemed
to
him
an
evasive
reply
doubtless
it
was
much
that
she
showed
neither
annoyance
nor
prudish
reserve
he
had
won
the
right
of
addressing
her
on
equal
terms
but
she
was
not
inclined
to
anticipate
that
future
day
to
which
he
pointed
have
never
thought
of
such
things
because
you
have
never
thought
of
me
as
i
of
you
every
day
of
your
absence
in
london
has
caused
me
torments
which
were
due
most
often
to
the
difference
between
your
social
position
and
mine
you
have
been
among
people
of
leisure
and
refinement
and
culture
each
evening
you
have
talked
with
men
whom
it
cost
no
effort
to
make
themselves
liked
and
respected
i
think
of
that
with
bitterness
why
i
have
made
many
acquaintances
have
met
very
interesting
people
i
am
glad
of
it
it
enables
me
to
understand
you
better
than
i
could
before
are
glad
on
that
account
indeed
i
am
i
think
you
mean
more
than
a
civil
phrase
mean
quite
simply
all
that
my
words
imply
i
have
thought
of
you
though
certainly
without
bitterness
no
one
conversation
in
london
interested
me
so
much
as
yours
soothed
with
an
exquisite
joy
godwin
felt
his
eyes
moisten
for
a
moment
he
was
reconciled
to
all
the
world
and
forgot
the
hostilities
of
a
lifetime
will
it
still
be
so
now
when
you
go
back
he
asked
in
a
soft
tone
am
sure
it
will
it
will
be
strange
if
i
ever
feel
bitterly
again
sidwell
smiled
could
have
said
nothing
that
could
please
me
more
why
should
your
life
be
troubled
by
these
dark
moods
i
could
understand
it
if
you
were
still
struggling
with
with
doubts
with
all
manner
of
uncertainties
about
your
course
she
hesitated
watching
his
face
think
i
have
chosen
well
said
godwin
meeting
her
look
sidwell
eyes
were
at
once
averted
hope
she
said
may
talk
of
that
again
very
soon
you
have
told
me
much
of
yourself
but
i
have
said
little
or
nothing
of
my
own
difficulties
it
wo
be
long
before
we
come
back
from
london
and
then
once
more
their
eyes
met
steadily
think
godwin
asked
i
am
right
in
aiming
at
a
life
of
retirement
is
one
of
my
doubts
your
influence
would
be
useful
anywhere
but
most
useful
surely
among
people
of
active
mind
i
sha
be
able
to
choose
remember
that
i
am
seeking
for
a
livelihood
as
well
as
for
a
sphere
of
usefulness
his
eyes
fell
as
he
spoke
hitherto
he
had
had
no
means
of
learning
whether
sidwell
would
bring
her
husband
a
dowry
substantial
enough
to
be
considered
though
he
could
not
feel
that
she
had
betrothed
herself
to
him
their
talk
was
so
nearly
that
of
avowed
lovers
that
perchance
she
would
disclose
whatever
might
help
to
put
his
mind
at
rest
the
thought
revived
his
painful
it
was
that
of
a
schemer
yet
would
not
the
curse
of
poverty
have
suggested
it
to
any
man
you
wo
be
able
to
choose
at
first
sidwell
assented
thereby
seeming
to
answer
his
unspoken
question
i
am
sure
my
father
will
use
whatever
influence
he
has
had
he
been
seated
near
enough
he
would
have
been
tempted
to
the
boldness
of
taking
her
hand
what
more
encouragement
did
he
await
but
the
distance
between
them
was
enough
to
check
his
embarrassed
impulses
he
could
not
even
call
her
it
would
have
been
easier
a
few
minutes
ago
before
she
had
begun
to
speak
with
such
calm
friendliness
now
in
spite
of
everything
he
felt
that
to
dare
such
a
familiarity
must
needs
call
upon
him
the
reproof
of
astonished
eyes
return
he
asked
suddenly
think
so
you
have
promised
me
to
be
cheerful
until
we
are
home
again
promise
to
be
cheerful
would
mean
much
but
it
mean
much
that
i
can
think
of
what
you
have
said
sidwell
did
not
speak
and
her
silence
seemed
to
compel
him
to
rise
it
was
strange
how
remote
he
still
felt
from
her
pure
grave
face
and
the
flowing
outlines
of
her
figure
why
could
he
not
say
to
her
love
you
give
me
your
hands
give
me
your
lips
such
words
seemed
impossible
yet
passion
thrilled
in
him
as
he
watched
the
grace
of
her
movements
the
light
and
shadow
upon
her
features
she
had
risen
and
come
a
step
or
two
forward
think
you
look
taller
in
that
dress
the
words
rather
escaped
him
than
were
spoken
his
need
was
to
talk
of
common
things
of
trifles
that
so
he
might
come
to
feel
humanly
sidwell
smiled
with
unmistakable
pleasure
i
do
you
like
the
dress
it
becomes
you
you
critical
in
such
things
with
understanding
but
i
should
like
to
see
you
every
day
in
a
new
and
beautiful
dress
i
could
afford
it
was
the
laughing
reply
he
offered
his
hand
the
touch
of
her
warm
soft
fingers
fired
his
blood
it
was
spoken
at
last
involuntarily
and
he
stood
with
his
eyes
on
hers
her
hand
crushed
in
his
day
she
whispered
if
their
lips
met
the
contact
was
so
slight
as
to
seem
accidental
it
was
the
mere
timorous
promise
of
a
future
kiss
and
both
were
glad
of
the
something
that
had
imposed
restraint
when
sidwell
went
up
to
her
mother
a
servant
had
just
brought
tea
hear
that
mr
peak
has
been
said
warricombe
who
looked
puffy
and
uncomfortable
after
her
sleep
was
going
to
take
tea
to
the
study
but
i
thought
it
unnecessary
how
could
he
know
that
we
were
here
met
him
this
morning
on
my
way
into
the
town
it
was
rather
inconsiderate
of
him
to
call
asked
if
he
might
warricombe
turned
her
head
and
examined
sidwell
and
did
he
stay
long
very
long
replied
sidwell
who
was
in
quiet
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
told
him
by
the
servant
that
i
was
not
well
enough
to
see
callers
you
did
mention
that
he
might
be
coming
warricombe
mind
worked
slowly
at
all
times
and
at
present
she
was
suffering
from
a
cold
did
you
speak
of
it
sidwell
i
forgot
replied
the
daughter
lightly
what
had
he
to
say
new
mother
is
your
head
better
dear
there
was
no
answer
warricombe
had
conceived
a
vague
suspicion
which
was
so
alarming
that
she
would
not
press
inquiries
alluding
to
it
the
encouragement
given
by
her
husband
to
godwin
peak
in
the
latter
social
progress
had
always
annoyed
her
though
she
could
not
frame
solid
objections
to
be
sure
to
say
of
a
man
that
he
is
about
to
be
ordained
meets
every
possible
question
that
society
can
put
but
warricombe
uneasiness
was
in
part
due
to
personal
dislike
oftener
than
not
she
still
thought
of
peak
as
he
appeared
some
eleven
years
ago
an
evident
plebeian
without
manners
without
a
redeeming
grace
she
knew
the
story
of
his
relative
who
had
opened
a
shop
in
kingsmill
thinking
of
that
now
she
shuddered
sidwell
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
matters
and
peak
was
not
again
mentioned
her
throat
being
still
troublesome
warricombe
retired
very
soon
after
dinner
about
nine
sidwell
went
to
the
library
and
sat
down
at
her
father
purposing
a
letter
to
sylvia
she
penned
a
line
or
two
but
soon
lapsed
into
reverie
her
head
on
her
hands
of
a
sudden
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
there
stood
buckland
fresh
from
travel
has
brought
you
exclaimed
his
sister
starting
up
anxiously
for
something
in
the
young
man
look
seemed
ominous
nothing
to
trouble
about
i
had
to
come
down
on
business
mother
gone
to
bed
sidwell
explained
right
does
matter
i
suppose
i
can
sleep
here
let
them
get
me
a
mouthful
of
something
cold
meat
anything
will
do
his
needs
were
quickly
supplied
and
before
long
he
was
smoking
by
the
library
fire
was
writing
to
sylvia
said
his
sister
glancing
at
her
fragmentary
letter
know
she
is
at
salisbury
no
i
did
his
carelessness
proved
to
sidwell
that
she
was
wrong
in
conjecturing
that
his
journey
had
something
to
do
with
miss
moorhouse
buckland
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
he
smoked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
whilst
sidwell
resumed
her
writing
course
you
have
seen
peak
fell
from
him
at
length
his
sister
looked
at
him
before
replying
he
called
this
afternoon
who
told
him
you
were
here
his
brows
were
knitted
and
he
spoke
very
abruptly
sidwell
gave
the
same
explanation
as
to
her
mother
and
had
further
to
reply
that
she
alone
received
the
caller
see
was
buckland
comment
its
tone
troubled
sidwell
your
coming
anything
to
do
with
mr
peak
it
has
i
want
to
see
him
the
first
thing
you
tell
me
what
about
he
searched
her
face
frowning
now
i
tell
you
in
the
morning
sidwell
saw
herself
doomed
to
a
night
of
suspense
she
could
not
confess
how
nearly
the
mystery
concerned
her
had
buckland
made
some
discovery
that
irritated
him
against
peak
she
knew
he
was
disposed
to
catch
at
anything
that
seemed
to
tell
against
godwin
claims
to
respectful
treatment
and
it
surely
must
be
a
grave
affair
to
hurry
him
on
so
long
a
journey
though
she
could
imagine
no
ground
of
fear
the
situation
was
seriously
disturbing
she
tried
to
go
on
with
her
letter
but
failed
as
buckland
smoked
in
silence
she
at
length
rose
and
said
she
would
go
upstairs
right
shall
see
you
at
breakfast
at
nine
next
morning
warricombe
sent
a
message
to
buckland
that
she
wished
to
see
him
in
her
bedroom
he
entered
hurriedly
better
mother
i
have
only
just
time
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
i
want
to
catch
peak
before
he
can
have
left
home
peak
why
i
was
going
to
speak
about
him
were
you
going
to
say
buckland
asked
anxiously
his
mother
began
in
a
roundabout
way
which
threatened
long
detention
in
a
minute
or
two
buckland
had
gathered
enough
to
interrupt
her
with
the
direct
inquiry
do
mean
that
there
anything
between
him
and
sidwell
do
hope
not
but
i
ca
imagine
why
she
should
really
almost
make
a
private
appointment
i
am
very
uneasy
buckland
i
have
hardly
slept
sidwell
is
rather
you
know
deuce
i
ca
stop
now
wait
an
hour
or
two
and
i
shall
have
seen
the
fellow
you
need
alarm
yourself
he
will
probably
have
disappeared
in
a
few
days
do
you
mean
warricombe
asked
with
nervous
eagerness
explain
afterwards
he
hurried
away
sidwell
was
at
the
her
eyes
seemed
to
declare
that
she
had
not
slept
well
with
an
insignificant
word
or
two
the
young
man
swallowed
his
cup
of
coffee
and
had
soon
left
the
house
chapter
iii
the
wrath
which
illumined
buckland
countenance
as
he
strode
rapidly
towards
longbrook
street
was
not
unmingled
with
joy
in
the
deep
pocket
of
his
ulster
lay
something
heavy
which
kept
striking
against
his
leg
and
every
such
contact
spurred
him
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
all
his
suspicions
were
abundantly
justified
not
only
would
his
father
and
sidwell
be
obliged
to
confess
that
his
insight
had
been
profounder
than
theirs
but
he
had
the
pleasure
of
standing
justified
before
his
own
conscience
the
philosophy
by
which
he
lived
was
strikingly
illustrated
and
confirmed
he
sniffed
the
morning
air
enjoyed
the
firmness
of
the
frozen
ground
on
which
his
boots
made
a
pleasant
thud
to
be
sure
the
interview
before
him
would
have
its
disagreeableness
but
buckland
was
not
one
of
those
men
who
shrink
from
every
scene
of
painful
explanation
the
detection
of
a
harmful
lie
was
decidedly
congenial
to
him
especially
when
he
and
his
had
been
made
its
victims
he
was
now
at
liberty
to
indulge
that
antipathetic
feeling
towards
godwin
peak
which
sundry
considerations
had
hitherto
urged
him
to
repress
whatever
might
have
passed
between
peak
and
sidwell
he
could
not
doubt
that
his
sister
peace
was
gravely
endangered
the
adventurer
with
however
much
or
little
sincerity
had
been
making
subtle
love
to
her
such
a
thought
was
intolerable
buckland
asserted
itself
with
brutal
vigour
now
that
it
had
moral
indignation
for
an
ally
he
had
never
been
at
peak
lodgings
but
the
address
was
long
since
noted
something
of
disdain
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
approached
the
row
of
insignificant
houses
having
pulled
the
bell
he
stood
at
his
full
height
looking
severely
at
the
number
painted
on
the
door
mrs
roots
opened
to
him
and
said
that
her
lodger
was
at
home
he
gave
his
name
and
after
waiting
for
a
moment
was
led
to
the
upper
floor
godwin
who
had
breakfasted
later
than
usual
still
sat
by
the
table
on
warricombe
entrance
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
but
with
deliberate
movement
scarcely
smiling
that
buckland
made
no
offer
of
a
friendly
hand
did
not
surprise
him
the
name
of
his
visitor
had
alarmed
him
with
a
sudden
presentiment
hardening
his
features
he
stood
in
expectancy
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
buckland
began
are
at
leisure
i
hope
sit
down
godwin
pointed
to
a
chair
near
the
fire
but
warricombe
having
thrown
his
hat
on
to
a
side
table
seated
himself
by
one
of
the
windows
his
motions
proved
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
support
a
semblance
of
courtesy
have
come
down
from
london
on
purpose
to
see
you
unless
i
am
strangely
misinformed
you
have
been
guilty
of
conduct
which
i
like
to
call
by
its
proper
name
remembering
that
he
was
in
a
little
house
with
thin
partitions
he
kept
his
voice
low
but
the
effort
this
cost
him
was
obvious
he
looked
straight
at
peak
who
did
not
return
the
gaze
said
godwin
coldly
is
my
crime
am
told
that
you
have
won
the
confidence
of
my
relatives
by
what
looks
like
a
scheme
of
gross
dishonesty
who
has
told
you
so
one
in
so
many
words
but
i
happened
to
come
across
certain
acquaintances
of
yours
in
london
people
who
know
you
very
well
indeed
and
i
find
that
they
regard
your
position
here
as
altogether
incredible
you
will
remember
i
had
much
the
same
feeling
myself
in
support
of
their
view
it
was
mentioned
to
me
that
you
had
published
an
article
in
the
date
less
than
a
year
ago
observe
the
article
was
anonymous
but
i
remember
it
very
well
i
have
it
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
the
views
it
expresses
can
be
reconciled
with
those
you
have
maintained
in
conversation
with
my
father
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
incriminating
periodical
turned
it
back
at
the
article
headed
new
sophistry
and
held
it
out
for
inspection
you
would
like
to
refresh
your
memory
thank
you
returned
godwin
with
a
smile
in
which
the
vanity
of
an
author
had
its
part
had
marcella
betrayed
him
he
had
supposed
she
knew
nothing
of
this
article
but
earwaker
had
perhaps
spoken
of
it
to
moxey
before
receiving
the
injunction
of
secrecy
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
earwaker
himself
from
whom
warricombe
had
derived
his
information
not
impossible
for
the
men
to
meet
and
earwaker
indignation
might
have
led
him
to
disregard
a
friend
confidence
the
details
mattered
little
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
most
serious
danger
that
could
befall
him
and
already
he
had
strung
himself
to
encounter
it
yet
even
in
the
same
moment
he
asked
it
worth
while
you
write
this
buckland
inquired
i
wrote
it
i
wait
for
your
explanation
must
expect
me
to
enter
upon
an
elaborate
defence
godwin
replied
taking
his
pipe
from
the
mantelpiece
and
beginning
to
fill
it
man
charged
with
rascality
can
hardly
help
getting
excited
and
that
excitement
to
one
in
your
mood
seems
evidence
against
him
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
i
have
never
declared
myself
an
orthodox
theologian
warricombe
is
well
acquainted
with
my
views
to
you
i
have
never
explained
them
mean
to
say
that
my
father
knew
of
this
article
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
why
not
for
one
thing
i
should
write
in
that
way
now
and
for
another
the
essay
seems
to
imply
more
than
i
meant
when
i
did
write
it
seems
to
imply
i
understand
you
wish
to
represent
that
this
attack
on
involves
no
attack
on
christianity
on
christianity
as
i
understand
it
buckland
face
expressed
profound
disgust
but
he
controlled
his
speech
i
foresaw
this
you
attacked
a
new
sophistry
but
there
is
a
newer
sophistry
still
and
uncommonly
difficult
it
is
to
deal
with
mr
peak
i
have
a
plain
word
to
say
to
you
more
than
a
year
ago
you
asked
me
for
my
goodwill
to
aid
you
in
getting
a
social
position
say
what
you
like
i
see
now
that
you
dealt
with
me
dishonestly
i
can
no
longer
be
your
friend
in
any
sense
and
i
shall
do
my
best
to
have
you
excluded
from
my
parents
house
my
father
will
this
essay
i
have
marked
the
significant
passages
throughout
and
will
form
his
own
judgment
i
know
what
it
will
be
are
within
your
rights
replied
buckland
with
polished
insolence
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
ca
forbid
you
to
go
to
the
house
again
but
i
hope
we
may
meet
there
it
would
be
very
unpleasant
godwin
was
still
pressing
down
the
tobacco
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
he
smiled
and
glanced
about
the
room
did
warricombe
know
how
far
things
had
gone
between
him
and
sidwell
whether
or
no
it
was
certain
now
that
sidwell
would
be
informed
of
this
disastrous
piece
of
authorship
and
the
result
what
did
it
matter
there
is
no
struggling
against
destiny
if
he
and
sidwell
were
ever
fated
to
come
together
why
these
difficulties
would
all
be
surmounted
if
as
seemed
more
than
likely
he
was
again
to
be
foiled
on
the
point
of
success
he
could
bear
it
perhaps
even
enjoy
the
comedy
is
no
possibility
of
arguing
against
determined
anger
he
said
quietly
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
plead
for
justice
one
only
does
that
with
a
friend
who
desires
to
be
just
my
opinions
are
utterly
distasteful
to
you
and
personal
motives
have
made
you
regard
me
as
a
scoundrel
to
be
got
rid
of
well
there
an
end
of
it
i
do
see
what
is
to
be
gained
by
further
talk
this
was
a
dismissal
godwin
felt
the
necessity
of
asserting
himself
thus
far
question
said
warricombe
as
he
put
the
periodical
back
into
his
pocket
do
you
mean
by
my
personal
motives
their
eyes
met
for
an
instant
mean
the
motives
which
you
have
spoken
of
it
was
buckland
hope
that
peak
might
reveal
his
relations
with
sidwell
but
he
shrank
from
seeming
to
know
anything
of
the
matter
clearly
no
light
was
to
be
had
from
this
source
am
afraid
he
said
moving
to
the
door
you
will
find
my
motives
shared
by
all
the
people
whose
acquaintance
you
have
made
in
exeter
and
without
further
he
departed
there
was
a
doubt
in
his
mind
peak
coolness
might
be
the
audacity
of
rascaldom
he
preferred
to
understand
it
so
but
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
baseness
it
he
muttered
to
himself
irritably
our
times
life
is
so
deucedly
complicated
it
used
to
be
the
easiest
thing
to
convict
a
man
of
religious
hypocrisy
nowadays
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
such
a
multiplicity
of
fine
considerations
there
that
fellow
bruno
chilvers
might
anyone
who
had
personal
reasons
treat
him
precisely
as
i
have
treated
peak
both
of
them
be
honest
yet
in
case
all
appearances
are
against
him
just
because
he
is
of
low
birth
has
no
means
and
wants
desperately
to
get
into
society
the
fellow
is
a
scoundrel
i
am
convinced
of
it
yet
his
designs
may
be
innocent
how
then
a
scoundrel
devil
has
he
really
fallen
in
love
with
sidwell
he
wants
position
and
the
comfort
it
brings
and
if
he
acted
like
a
blackguard
if
he
had
come
among
us
telling
the
truth
who
knows
sidwell
would
then
have
thought
of
him
but
for
my
own
part
i
would
willingly
have
given
him
a
hand
there
are
plenty
of
girls
who
have
learned
to
think
for
themselves
this
was
an
unhappy
line
of
reflection
it
led
to
sylvia
moorhouse
and
to
grinding
of
the
teeth
by
the
time
he
reached
the
house
buckland
was
again
in
remorseless
mood
he
would
have
it
out
with
sidwell
the
desire
of
proving
to
her
that
he
had
been
right
from
the
first
overrode
all
thought
of
the
pain
he
might
inflict
she
was
in
the
library
at
breakfast
he
had
noticed
her
heavy
eyes
and
that
she
made
only
a
pretence
of
eating
she
was
now
less
unlike
herself
but
her
position
at
the
window
showed
that
she
had
been
waiting
impatiently
mother
coming
down
he
asked
after
luncheon
she
will
go
out
for
an
hour
if
it
keeps
fine
you
return
mother
feels
able
to
travel
he
had
in
his
hand
and
stood
rustling
the
pages
with
his
fingers
have
been
to
see
peak
you
she
moved
a
few
steps
and
seated
herself
sideways
on
a
small
chair
business
with
him
was
confoundedly
unpleasant
i
glad
it
over
i
wish
i
had
known
what
i
now
do
half
a
year
ago
me
hear
what
it
is
remember
that
i
told
you
to
be
on
your
guard
against
peak
sidwell
smiled
faintly
and
glanced
at
him
but
made
no
answer
knew
he
was
to
be
trusted
pursued
her
brother
with
gloomy
satisfaction
i
had
far
better
means
of
judging
than
father
or
you
but
of
course
my
suspicions
were
ungenerous
and
cynical
you
come
to
the
point
said
sidwell
in
an
irritated
tone
think
you
read
this
article
in
he
approached
and
showed
it
to
her
spoke
of
it
once
of
book
she
raised
her
eyes
and
met
his
with
a
look
of
concern
she
could
not
disguise
of
that
is
the
author
of
it
it
seems
to
have
been
written
just
about
the
time
when
i
met
him
and
brought
him
here
as
a
visitor
and
it
was
published
after
he
had
begun
to
edify
you
with
his
zeal
for
christianity
she
held
out
her
hand
remember
the
tone
of
the
thing
buckland
added
leave
it
with
you
but
just
glance
at
one
or
two
of
the
passages
i
have
marked
the
anglicanism
of
their
writer
is
decidedly
broad
it
seems
to
me
he
moved
apart
and
watched
his
sister
as
she
bent
over
the
pages
there
was
silence
for
five
minutes
seeing
that
sidwell
had
ceased
to
read
he
ejaculated
mr
peak
admitted
the
authorship
she
asked
slowly
and
distinctly
and
with
a
cool
impudence
i
hardly
expected
you
mean
that
he
has
made
no
attempt
to
justify
himself
worth
listening
to
practically
he
refused
an
explanation
sidwell
rested
her
forehead
lightly
upon
the
tips
of
her
fingers
the
periodical
slipped
from
her
lap
and
lay
open
on
the
floor
did
you
find
this
out
the
simplest
way
knowing
perfectly
well
that
i
had
only
to
get
familiar
with
some
of
his
old
friends
to
obtain
proof
that
he
was
an
impostor
i
followed
up
my
acquaintance
with
miss
moxey
got
hold
of
her
brother
called
upon
them
whilst
i
was
there
a
man
named
malkin
came
in
and
somehow
or
other
he
began
talking
of
peak
i
learned
at
once
precisely
what
i
expected
that
peak
was
known
to
all
these
people
as
a
violent
malkin
refused
to
believe
the
story
of
his
going
in
for
the
church
it
sounded
to
him
a
mere
joke
then
came
out
the
fact
that
he
had
written
this
article
they
all
knew
about
it
he
saw
a
flush
of
shame
upon
sidwell
face
it
gratified
him
he
was
resolved
to
let
her
taste
all
the
bitterness
of
her
folly
seems
pretty
clear
that
the
moxeys
at
all
events
miss
moxey
knew
the
rascally
part
he
was
playing
whether
they
wished
to
unmask
him
or
not
i
ca
say
perhaps
not
yet
i
caught
an
odd
look
on
miss
face
when
that
man
malkin
began
to
talk
of
peak
characteristics
and
achievements
it
came
out
that
he
had
given
all
his
acquaintances
the
slip
they
had
completely
lost
sight
of
him
i
suppose
until
miss
moxey
met
him
by
chance
at
budleigh
salterton
there
some
mystery
still
she
evidently
kept
peak
secret
from
the
moorhouses
and
the
walworths
a
nice
business
altogether
again
there
was
a
long
silence
then
sidwell
raised
her
face
and
said
abruptly
may
be
quite
mistaken
went
to
mr
peak
in
a
spirit
of
enmity
and
anger
it
is
not
likely
he
would
explain
himself
you
may
have
quite
misunderstood
what
he
said
you
mean
that
he
was
perhaps
converted
after
writing
this
article
then
why
did
he
allow
it
to
be
published
did
not
sign
it
he
may
have
been
unable
to
withdraw
it
from
the
editor
hands
he
did
sign
it
because
the
idea
of
this
exeter
campaign
came
between
the
reception
and
the
appearance
of
his
paper
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
he
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
see
his
name
in
the
scoundrelly
project
was
conceived
perhaps
the
very
day
that
i
brought
him
here
perhaps
in
that
moment
at
lunch
do
you
remember
when
he
began
to
talk
of
the
sermon
at
the
cathedral
did
he
go
to
the
cathedral
and
hear
that
sermon
amuse
a
sunday
morning
i
suppose
is
not
very
likely
in
a
man
who
hates
and
ridicules
religion
is
decidedly
more
probable
than
the
idea
of
his
conversion
sidwell
fell
back
again
into
her
brooding
attitude
reason
of
your
mistake
in
judging
him
resumed
buckland
with
emphasis
that
you
have
undervalued
his
intellect
i
told
you
long
ago
that
a
man
of
peak
calibre
could
not
possibly
be
a
supporter
of
dogmas
and
churches
no
amount
of
plausible
evidence
would
have
made
me
believe
in
his
sincerity
let
me
beg
you
to
appreciate
the
simple
fact
that
young
man
of
brains
and
education
is
nowadays
an
honest
defender
of
mediaeval
christianity
the
christianity
of
your
churches
such
fellows
may
transact
with
their
conscience
and
make
a
more
or
less
decent
business
of
the
clerical
career
or
in
rare
cases
they
may
believe
that
society
is
served
by
the
maintenance
of
a
national
faith
and
accordingly
preach
with
all
manner
of
mental
reserves
and
symbolical
interpretations
these
are
in
reality
politicians
not
priests
but
peak
belongs
to
neither
class
he
is
an
acute
cynic
bent
on
making
the
best
of
this
world
since
he
believes
in
no
other
how
he
must
have
chuckled
after
every
visit
to
this
house
he
despises
you
one
and
all
believe
me
he
regards
you
with
profound
contempt
buckland
obtuseness
on
the
imaginative
side
spared
him
the
understanding
of
his
sister
state
of
mind
though
in
theory
he
recognised
that
women
were
little
amenable
to
reasoning
he
took
it
for
granted
that
a
clear
demonstration
of
peak
duplicity
must
at
once
banish
all
thought
of
him
from
sidwell
mind
therefore
he
was
unsparing
in
his
assaults
upon
her
delusion
it
surprised
him
when
at
length
sidwell
looked
up
with
flashing
eyes
and
addressed
him
indignantly
all
this
there
is
not
one
word
of
truth
you
know
that
in
representing
the
clergy
as
a
body
of
ignorant
and
shallow
men
you
speak
out
of
prejudice
if
you
believed
what
you
say
you
would
be
yourself
both
ignorant
and
shallow
i
ca
trust
your
judgment
of
anyone
whatever
she
paused
but
in
a
moment
added
the
remark
which
would
have
come
first
had
she
spoken
in
the
order
of
her
thoughts
is
because
the
spirit
of
contempt
is
so
familiar
to
you
that
you
are
so
ready
to
perceive
it
in
others
i
consider
that
habit
of
mind
worse
than
hypocrisy
yes
worse
far
worse
buckland
was
sorry
for
the
pain
he
had
given
the
retort
did
not
affect
him
but
he
hung
his
head
and
looked
uncomfortable
his
next
speech
was
in
a
milder
strain
feel
it
a
duty
sidwell
to
represent
this
man
to
you
in
what
i
verily
believe
to
be
the
true
light
to
be
despised
by
one
who
is
immeasurably
contemptible
surely
ca
distress
you
if
a
butler
gets
into
your
house
by
means
of
a
forged
character
and
then
lays
his
plans
for
a
great
burglary
no
doubt
he
scorns
you
for
being
so
easily
taken
in
and
that
is
an
exact
parallel
to
peak
proceedings
he
has
somehow
got
the
exterior
of
a
gentleman
you
could
not
believe
that
one
who
behaved
so
agreeably
and
talked
so
well
was
concealing
an
essentially
base
nature
but
i
must
remind
you
that
peak
belongs
by
origin
to
the
lower
classes
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
lacks
the
sense
of
honour
generally
inherited
by
men
of
our
world
a
powerful
intellect
by
no
means
implies
a
corresponding
development
of
the
moral
sense
sidwell
could
not
close
her
ears
against
the
argument
but
her
features
were
still
set
in
an
expression
of
resentment
and
she
kept
silence
lest
her
voice
should
sound
tearful
do
be
tempted
by
personal
feeling
pursued
her
brother
make
light
of
hypocrisy
especially
this
kind
the
man
who
can
act
such
a
part
as
peak
has
been
for
the
last
twelve
months
must
be
capable
of
any
depravity
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
estimate
his
baseness
because
you
are
only
half
convinced
that
any
one
can
really
be
an
enemy
of
religious
faith
you
suspect
a
lurking
belief
even
in
the
minds
of
avowed
atheists
but
take
the
assurance
from
me
that
a
man
like
peak
and
i
am
at
one
with
him
in
this
matter
regards
with
absolute
repugnance
every
form
of
supernaturalism
for
him
to
affect
belief
in
your
religion
is
a
crime
against
conscience
peak
has
committed
this
crime
with
a
mercenary
motive
what
viler
charge
could
be
brought
against
him
without
looking
at
him
his
sister
replied
he
is
guilty
or
not
i
ca
yet
determine
but
the
motive
of
his
life
here
was
not
mercenary
how
would
you
describe
it
buckland
asked
in
astonishment
only
know
that
it
ca
be
called
mercenary
the
distinction
you
draw
must
be
a
very
fine
he
has
abandoned
the
employment
by
which
he
lived
and
by
his
own
admission
he
looks
to
the
church
for
means
of
support
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
interest
with
people
of
social
position
the
closer
his
relations
with
them
the
better
from
month
to
month
he
has
worked
skilfully
to
establish
his
footing
in
this
house
and
among
your
friends
what
do
you
call
this
she
had
no
verbal
answer
to
make
but
her
look
declared
that
she
held
to
another
interpretation
buckland
added
impatiently
will
hear
father
opinion
he
remember
has
been
deceived
in
a
very
gross
and
cruel
way
possibly
he
may
help
you
to
see
the
thing
in
all
its
hatefulness
sidwell
turned
to
him
go
to
london
this
afternoon
an
hour
or
two
he
replied
consulting
his
watch
it
any
use
my
asking
you
to
keep
silence
about
everything
until
i
am
back
in
town
buckland
frowned
and
hesitated
mother
as
well
as
father
you
mean
will
you
do
me
this
kindness
me
a
question
sidwell
have
you
any
thought
of
seeing
peak
ca
say
she
replied
in
agitation
must
leave
myself
free
i
have
a
right
to
use
my
own
judgment
see
him
i
beg
you
not
to
see
him
he
was
so
earnest
that
sidwell
suspected
some
other
reason
in
his
request
than
regard
for
her
dignity
must
leave
myself
free
she
repeated
with
shaking
voice
any
case
i
shall
be
back
in
london
evening
that
is
if
but
i
am
sure
mother
will
wish
to
go
grant
me
this
one
kindness
say
nothing
here
or
there
till
i
am
back
and
have
seen
you
again
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
for
the
persistency
with
which
she
resisted
proof
of
peak
dishonour
had
begun
to
alarm
him
who
could
say
what
miserable
folly
she
might
commit
in
the
next
hours
the
unavoidable
necessity
of
his
own
return
exasperated
him
he
wished
to
see
her
safe
back
in
london
and
under
her
father
care
he
exclaimed
with
a
gesture
of
determination
ca
keep
such
a
thing
as
this
secret
for
another
hour
mother
must
know
at
once
especially
as
you
mean
to
invite
that
fellow
into
the
house
i
have
half
a
mind
to
telegraph
to
godolphin
that
i
possibly
be
with
him
sidwell
regarded
him
and
spoke
with
forced
composure
as
seems
right
to
you
buckland
but
do
think
that
by
remaining
here
you
would
prevent
me
from
seeing
mr
peak
if
i
wish
to
do
so
that
is
treating
me
too
much
like
a
child
you
have
done
your
part
doubtless
your
duty
now
i
must
reflect
and
judge
for
myself
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
has
authority
over
me
in
such
circumstances
well
i
have
no
authority
as
you
say
but
common
sense
bids
me
let
mother
know
how
the
case
stands
and
angrily
he
left
the
room
still
lay
where
it
had
fallen
when
sidwell
had
stood
a
while
in
confused
thought
her
eye
turned
to
it
and
she
went
hurriedly
to
take
it
up
yes
that
was
the
first
thing
to
be
done
to
read
those
pages
with
close
care
for
this
she
must
have
privacy
she
ran
upstairs
and
shut
herself
in
her
bedroom
but
did
not
at
once
begin
to
read
it
concerned
her
deeply
to
know
whether
peak
had
so
expressed
himself
in
this
paper
that
no
room
was
left
for
doubt
as
to
his
convictions
but
another
question
pressed
upon
her
with
even
more
urgency
could
it
be
true
that
he
did
not
love
her
if
buckland
were
wholly
right
then
it
mattered
little
in
what
degree
she
had
been
misled
by
intellectual
hypocrisy
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
peak
had
made
love
to
her
in
cold
blood
with
none
but
sordid
impulses
the
thought
was
so
humiliating
that
her
mind
resolutely
rejected
it
and
she
had
no
difficulty
in
recalling
numberless
minutiae
of
behaviour
nuances
of
look
and
tone
such
as
abide
in
a
woman
memory
any
one
of
which
would
have
sufficed
to
persuade
her
that
he
felt
genuine
emotion
how
had
it
come
to
pass
that
a
feeling
of
friendly
interest
which
did
not
for
a
moment
threaten
her
peace
changed
all
at
once
to
an
agitation
only
the
more
persistent
the
more
she
tried
to
subdue
it
how
if
it
were
not
that
her
heart
responded
to
a
passionate
appeal
effectual
as
only
the
sincerest
love
can
prove
prior
to
that
long
talk
with
godwin
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
for
london
she
had
not
imagined
that
he
loved
her
when
they
said
to
each
other
she
knew
by
her
own
sensations
all
that
the
parting
meant
to
him
she
felt
glad
instead
of
sorry
that
they
were
not
to
meet
again
for
several
months
for
she
wished
to
think
of
him
calmly
and
prudently
now
that
he
presented
himself
to
her
imagination
in
so
new
an
aspect
the
was
a
mutual
assurance
of
fidelity
should
never
have
loved
him
if
he
had
not
first
loved
me
of
that
i
am
as
firmly
convinced
as
of
my
own
existence
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
dream
romances
i
never
did
so
even
as
a
young
girl
and
at
this
age
i
am
not
likely
to
fall
into
a
foolish
i
had
often
thought
about
him
he
seemed
to
me
a
man
of
higher
and
more
complex
type
than
those
with
whom
i
was
familiar
but
most
surely
i
never
attributed
to
him
even
a
corresponding
interest
in
me
i
am
neither
vain
nor
very
anxious
to
please
i
never
suffered
because
men
did
not
woo
me
i
have
only
moderate
good
looks
and
certainly
no
uncommon
mental
if
he
had
been
attracted
by
sylvia
i
should
have
thought
it
natural
and
i
more
than
once
suspected
that
sylvia
was
disposed
to
like
him
it
seemed
strange
at
first
that
his
choice
should
have
fallen
upon
me
yet
when
i
was
far
away
from
him
and
longed
so
to
sit
once
more
by
him
and
hear
him
talk
i
understood
that
it
might
be
in
my
power
to
afford
him
the
companionship
he
mercenary
if
i
had
been
merely
a
governess
in
the
house
he
would
have
loved
me
just
the
same
only
by
a
painful
effort
could
she
remind
herself
that
the
ideal
which
had
grown
so
slowly
was
now
defaced
he
loved
her
but
it
was
not
the
love
of
an
honest
man
after
all
she
had
no
need
to
peruse
this
writing
of
his
she
remembered
so
well
how
it
had
impressed
her
when
she
read
it
on
its
first
appearance
how
her
father
had
spoken
of
it
buckland
manifold
evidence
was
irresistible
why
should
peak
have
concealed
his
authorship
why
had
he
disappeared
from
among
the
people
who
thoroughly
knew
him
she
had
loved
a
dream
what
a
task
would
it
be
to
distinguish
between
those
parts
of
peak
conversation
which
represented
his
real
thoughts
and
those
which
were
mockery
of
his
listeners
the
plan
of
a
retired
life
which
he
had
sketched
to
her
was
it
all
falsehood
impossible
for
his
love
was
inextricably
blended
with
the
details
did
he
imagine
that
the
secret
of
his
unbelief
could
be
preserved
for
a
lifetime
and
that
it
would
have
no
effect
whatever
upon
his
happiness
as
a
man
this
seemed
a
likely
reading
of
the
problem
but
what
a
multitude
of
moral
and
intellectual
obscurities
remained
the
character
which
had
seemed
to
her
nobly
simple
was
become
a
dark
and
dread
enigma
she
knew
so
little
of
his
life
if
only
it
could
all
be
laid
bare
to
her
the
secret
of
his
position
would
be
revealed
buckland
violence
altogether
missed
its
mark
the
dishonour
of
such
a
man
as
godwin
peak
was
due
to
no
gross
incentive
it
was
probable
that
in
talk
with
her
father
he
had
been
guilty
of
more
deliberate
misrepresentation
than
had
marked
his
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
the
family
her
father
she
felt
sure
had
come
to
regard
him
as
a
valuable
source
of
argument
in
the
battle
against
materialism
doubtless
the
german
book
which
peak
was
translating
bore
upon
that
debate
and
consequently
was
used
as
an
aid
to
dissimulation
thinking
of
this
she
all
but
shared
her
brother
vehement
feeling
it
pained
her
to
the
inmost
heart
that
her
father
generous
and
candid
nature
should
thus
have
been
played
upon
the
deceit
as
it
concerned
herself
alone
she
could
forgive
at
least
she
could
suspend
judgment
until
the
accused
had
offered
his
defence
feeling
that
the
psychology
of
the
case
must
till
then
be
beyond
her
powers
of
analysis
but
the
wrong
done
to
her
father
revolted
her
a
tap
at
the
door
caused
her
to
rise
trembling
she
remembered
that
by
this
time
her
mother
must
be
aware
of
the
extraordinary
disclosure
and
that
a
new
scene
of
wretched
agitation
had
to
be
gone
through
it
was
warricombe
voice
and
the
door
opened
what
all
this
mean
i
do
understand
half
that
buckland
has
been
telling
me
the
speaker
face
was
mottled
and
she
stood
panting
a
hand
pressed
against
her
side
very
very
imprudent
we
have
been
how
wrong
of
father
not
to
have
made
inquiries
to
think
that
such
a
man
should
have
sat
at
our
table
down
mother
do
be
so
distressed
said
sidwell
calmly
will
all
very
soon
be
settled
course
not
a
word
must
be
said
to
anyone
how
very
fortunate
that
we
shall
be
in
london
till
the
summer
of
course
he
must
leave
exeter
have
no
doubt
he
will
let
us
talk
as
little
of
it
as
possible
mother
we
shall
go
back
afternoon
we
will
go
back
with
buckland
that
is
decided
i
could
sleep
here
another
night
must
remain
till
sidwell
replied
with
quiet
determination
what
reason
can
there
be
warricombe
voice
was
suspended
by
a
horrible
surmise
course
we
shall
go
sidwell
she
continued
in
nervous
haste
think
of
that
man
having
the
impudence
to
call
and
sit
talking
with
you
if
i
could
have
dreamt
said
sidwell
gravely
am
obliged
to
see
mr
peak
either
this
evening
or
morning
to
him
sidwell
what
can
you
mean
have
a
reason
for
wishing
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
the
whole
truth
we
the
whole
truth
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
dear
who
is
this
mr
peak
that
you
should
ask
him
to
come
and
see
you
under
circumstances
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
sidwell
to
debate
with
her
mother
on
subtle
questions
of
character
and
motive
but
the
agitation
of
her
nerves
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
keep
silence
under
these
vapid
outcries
she
desired
to
be
alone
commonplace
discussion
of
the
misery
that
had
come
upon
her
was
impossible
a
little
more
strain
and
she
would
be
on
the
point
of
tears
a
weakness
she
was
resolute
to
avoid
me
think
quietly
for
an
hour
or
two
she
said
moving
away
quite
certain
that
i
must
stay
here
till
when
buckland
has
gone
we
can
talk
again
sidwell
you
insist
i
must
leave
the
house
and
find
a
refuge
somewhere
else
warricombe
tossed
her
head
if
i
am
not
permitted
to
speak
to
you
i
only
hope
you
wo
have
occasion
to
remember
my
warning
such
extraordinary
behaviour
was
surely
never
known
i
should
have
thought
sidwell
was
by
this
time
out
of
the
room
safe
in
privacy
she
sat
down
as
if
to
pen
a
letter
from
an
hour
agitated
thought
the
following
lines
resulted
brother
has
told
me
of
a
conversation
he
held
with
you
this
morning
he
says
you
admit
the
authorship
of
an
article
which
seems
quite
inconsistent
with
what
you
have
professed
in
our
talks
how
am
i
to
understand
this
contradiction
i
beg
that
you
will
write
to
me
at
once
i
shall
anxiously
await
your
reply
this
with
her
signature
was
all
having
enclosed
the
note
in
an
envelope
she
left
it
on
her
table
and
went
down
to
the
library
where
buckland
was
sitting
alone
in
gloomy
reverie
warricombe
had
told
him
of
sidwell
incredible
purpose
recognising
his
independence
and
feeling
sure
that
if
she
saw
peak
it
could
only
be
to
take
final
leave
of
him
he
had
decided
to
say
no
more
to
london
he
must
perforce
return
this
afternoon
but
he
had
done
his
duty
satisfactorily
and
just
in
time
it
was
plain
that
things
had
gone
far
between
peak
and
sidwell
the
latter
behaviour
avowed
it
but
danger
there
could
be
none
with
new
sophistry
staring
her
in
the
eyes
let
her
see
the
fellow
by
all
means
his
evasions
and
would
complete
her
deliverance
a
train
at
buckland
remarked
rising
i
shall
catch
it
if
i
start
now
i
ca
stay
for
the
discomfort
of
luncheon
you
remain
here
till
i
understand
a
pity
you
are
angry
with
me
it
seems
to
me
i
have
done
you
a
kindness
am
not
angry
with
you
buckland
she
replied
gently
have
done
what
you
were
plainly
obliged
to
do
a
sensible
way
of
putting
it
let
us
say
goodbye
with
friendliness
then
sidwell
gave
her
hand
and
tried
to
smile
with
a
look
of
pained
affection
buckland
went
silently
away
shortly
after
sidwell
fetched
her
note
from
upstairs
and
gave
it
to
the
housekeeper
to
be
delivered
by
hand
as
soon
as
possible
mrs
warricombe
remained
invisible
and
sidwell
went
back
to
the
library
where
she
sat
with
open
before
her
at
godwin
essay
hours
went
by
she
still
waited
for
an
answer
from
longbrook
street
at
six
she
went
upstairs
and
spoke
to
her
mother
you
come
down
to
dinner
sidwell
was
the
cold
reply
so
good
as
to
excuse
me
towards
eight
a
letter
was
brought
to
her
it
could
only
be
from
godwin
peak
with
eyes
which
endeavoured
to
take
in
all
at
once
and
therefore
could
at
first
distinguish
nothing
she
scanned
what
seemed
to
be
hurriedly
written
lines
have
tried
to
answer
you
in
a
long
letter
but
after
all
i
send
it
i
fear
you
would
understand
better
to
repeat
simply
that
i
wrote
the
article
you
speak
of
i
should
have
told
you
about
it
some
day
but
now
my
intentions
and
hopes
matter
nothing
whatever
i
said
now
would
seem
dishonest
pleading
she
read
this
so
many
times
that
at
length
she
had
but
to
close
her
eyes
to
see
every
word
clearly
traced
on
the
darkness
the
meanings
she
extracted
from
each
sentence
were
scarcely
less
numerous
than
her
perusals
in
spite
of
reason
this
enigmatic
answer
brought
her
some
solace
he
defend
himself
that
was
the
assurance
she
had
longed
for
impossible
she
again
and
again
declared
to
herself
with
emphasis
for
their
intimacy
to
be
resumed
but
in
secret
she
could
hold
him
if
not
innocent
at
all
events
not
base
she
had
not
bestowed
her
love
upon
a
mere
impostor
but
now
a
mournful
regretful
passion
began
to
weigh
upon
her
heart
she
shed
tears
and
presently
stole
away
to
her
room
for
a
night
of
sorrow
what
must
be
her
practical
course
if
she
went
back
to
london
without
addressing
another
word
to
him
he
must
understand
her
silence
as
a
final
farewell
in
that
case
his
departure
from
exeter
would
no
doubt
speedily
follow
and
there
was
little
likelihood
that
she
would
ever
again
see
him
were
godwin
a
vulgar
schemer
he
would
not
so
readily
relinquish
the
advantage
he
had
gained
he
would
calculate
upon
the
weakness
of
a
loving
woman
and
make
at
least
one
effort
to
redeem
his
position
as
it
was
she
could
neither
hope
nor
fear
that
he
would
try
to
see
her
again
yet
she
wished
to
see
him
desired
it
ardently
and
yet
for
each
impulse
of
ardour
was
followed
by
a
cold
fit
of
reasoning
might
not
his
abandonment
of
the
position
bear
a
meaning
such
as
buckland
would
of
course
attribute
to
it
if
he
were
hopeless
of
the
goodwill
of
her
parents
what
profit
would
it
be
to
him
to
retain
her
love
she
was
no
heiress
supposing
him
actuated
by
base
motive
her
value
in
his
eyes
came
merely
of
his
regarding
her
as
a
means
to
an
end
but
this
was
to
reopen
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
truly
loved
her
no
he
was
forsaking
her
because
he
thought
it
impossible
for
her
to
pardon
the
deceit
he
had
undeniably
practised
with
whatever
palliating
circumstances
he
was
overcome
with
shame
he
imagined
her
indignant
scornful
why
had
she
written
such
a
short
cold
note
the
very
thing
to
produce
in
his
mind
a
conviction
of
her
resentment
hereupon
came
another
paroxysm
of
tearful
misery
it
was
intensified
by
a
thought
she
had
half
consciously
been
repressing
ever
since
the
conversation
with
her
brother
was
it
true
that
miss
moxey
had
had
it
in
her
power
to
strip
godwin
of
a
disguise
what
then
were
the
relations
existing
between
him
and
that
strangely
impressive
woman
how
long
had
they
known
each
other
it
was
now
all
but
certain
that
a
strong
intellectual
sympathy
united
their
minds
and
perhaps
there
had
been
something
more
she
turned
her
face
upon
the
pillow
and
moaned
chapter
iv
and
from
the
moxeys
buckland
had
derived
his
information
what
was
it
he
said
something
about
odd
look
on
miss
moxey
face
when
that
friend
of
theirs
talked
of
peak
might
not
such
a
look
signify
a
conflict
between
the
temptation
to
injure
and
the
desire
to
screen
sidwell
constructed
a
complete
romance
ignorance
of
the
past
of
both
persons
concerned
allowed
her
imagination
free
play
there
was
no
limit
to
the
possibilities
of
the
desire
to
see
godwin
took
such
hold
upon
her
that
she
had
already
begun
to
think
over
the
wording
of
another
note
to
be
sent
to
him
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
his
reply
had
been
insufficient
simple
justice
required
that
she
should
hear
him
in
his
own
defence
before
parting
with
him
for
ever
if
she
kept
silence
he
would
always
remember
her
with
bitterness
and
this
would
make
her
sorrow
harder
to
bear
sidwell
was
one
of
those
few
women
whose
love
never
demonstrative
never
exigent
only
declares
itself
in
all
its
profound
significance
when
it
is
called
upon
to
pardon
what
was
likely
to
be
the
issue
of
a
meeting
with
godwin
she
could
not
foresee
it
seemed
all
but
impossible
for
their
intercourse
to
continue
and
their
coming
face
to
face
might
result
in
nothing
but
distress
to
both
better
avoided
yet
judgment
yielded
to
emotion
yesterday
only
yesterday
she
had
yielded
herself
to
the
joy
of
loving
and
before
her
consciousness
had
had
time
to
make
itself
familiar
with
its
new
realm
before
her
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
light
suddenly
shed
about
her
she
was
bidden
to
think
of
what
had
happened
as
only
a
dream
her
heart
refused
to
make
surrender
of
its
hope
though
it
could
be
held
only
by
an
encouragement
of
recognised
illusion
she
preferred
to
dream
yet
a
little
longer
above
all
she
must
taste
the
luxury
of
forgiving
her
lover
of
making
sure
that
her
image
would
not
dwell
in
his
mind
as
that
of
a
woman
who
had
turned
coldly
from
his
error
perhaps
from
his
repentance
a
little
after
midnight
she
rose
from
bed
slipped
on
her
and
sat
down
by
the
still
burning
lamp
to
write
what
her
passion
dictated
should
you
distrust
my
ability
or
my
willingness
to
understand
you
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
if
you
had
sent
what
you
first
wrote
these
few
lines
do
not
even
let
me
know
whether
you
think
yourself
to
blame
why
do
you
leave
me
to
form
a
judgment
of
things
as
they
appear
on
the
surface
if
you
to
explain
if
you
sincerely
feel
that
i
am
in
danger
of
wronging
you
by
misconstruction
come
to
me
as
soon
as
you
have
received
this
note
if
you
will
not
come
then
at
least
write
to
me
the
letter
you
at
first
thought
of
sending
this
afternoon
friday
i
return
to
london
but
you
know
my
address
there
do
think
because
i
wrote
so
briefly
that
i
have
judged
you
to
have
committed
this
to
paper
was
a
relief
in
the
morning
she
would
read
it
over
and
consider
again
whether
she
wished
to
send
it
on
the
table
lay
she
opened
it
once
more
at
the
page
that
concerned
her
and
glanced
over
the
first
few
lines
then
having
put
the
lamp
nearer
to
the
bed
she
again
lay
down
not
to
sleep
but
to
read
this
essay
was
not
so
repugnant
to
her
mind
or
her
feelings
as
when
she
first
became
acquainted
with
it
its
bitterness
no
longer
seemed
to
be
directed
against
herself
there
was
much
in
it
with
which
she
could
have
agreed
at
any
time
during
the
last
six
months
and
many
strokes
of
satire
which
till
the
other
day
would
have
offended
her
she
now
felt
to
be
legitimate
as
she
read
on
a
kind
of
anger
such
as
she
had
never
experienced
trembled
along
her
nerves
was
it
not
flagrantly
true
that
english
society
at
large
made
profession
of
a
faith
which
in
no
sense
whatever
it
could
be
said
sincerely
to
hold
was
there
not
every
reason
to
believe
that
thousands
of
people
keep
up
an
ignoble
formalism
because
they
feared
the
social
results
of
declaring
their
severance
from
the
religion
of
the
churches
this
was
a
monstrous
evil
she
had
never
till
this
moment
understood
the
scope
of
its
baneful
effects
but
for
the
prevalence
of
such
a
spirit
of
hypocrisy
godwin
peak
would
never
have
sinned
against
his
honour
why
was
it
not
declared
in
of
authority
from
end
to
end
of
the
christian
world
that
christianity
as
it
has
been
understood
through
the
ages
can
no
longer
be
accepted
for
that
was
the
truth
the
truth
the
she
lay
back
quivering
as
if
with
terror
for
an
instant
her
soul
had
been
filled
with
hatred
of
the
religion
for
which
she
could
once
have
died
it
had
stood
before
her
as
a
power
of
darkness
and
ignorance
to
be
assailed
crushed
driven
from
the
memory
of
man
last
night
she
had
hardly
slept
and
now
though
her
body
was
numb
with
weariness
her
mind
kept
up
a
feverish
activity
she
was
bent
on
excusing
godwin
and
the
only
way
in
which
she
could
do
so
was
by
arraigning
the
world
for
its
huge
dishonesty
in
a
condition
between
slumber
and
waking
she
seemed
to
plead
for
him
before
a
circle
of
pharisaic
accusers
streams
of
silent
eloquence
rushed
through
her
brain
and
the
spirit
which
prompted
her
was
closely
akin
to
that
of
new
sophistry
now
and
then
for
a
few
seconds
she
was
smitten
with
a
consciousness
of
extraordinary
change
in
her
habits
of
thought
she
looked
about
her
with
wide
fearful
eyes
and
endeavoured
to
see
things
in
the
familiar
aspect
as
if
with
physical
constraint
her
angry
imagination
again
overcame
her
until
at
length
from
the
penumbra
of
sleep
she
passed
into
its
profoundest
gloom
to
wake
when
dawn
was
pale
at
the
window
a
choking
odour
reminded
her
that
she
had
not
extinguished
the
lamp
which
must
have
gone
out
for
lack
of
oil
she
opened
the
window
took
a
draught
of
water
and
addressed
herself
to
sleep
again
but
in
recollecting
what
the
new
day
meant
for
her
she
had
spoilt
the
chances
of
longer
rest
her
head
ached
all
worldly
thoughts
were
repulsive
yet
she
could
not
dismiss
them
she
tried
to
repeat
the
prayers
she
had
known
since
childhood
but
they
were
meaningless
and
a
sense
of
shame
attached
to
their
utterance
when
the
first
gleam
of
sun
told
her
that
it
was
past
eight
o
clock
she
made
an
effort
and
rose
at
breakfast
warricombe
talked
of
the
departure
for
london
she
mentioned
an
early
train
by
getting
ready
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
they
could
easily
reach
the
station
in
time
sidwell
made
no
direct
reply
and
seemed
to
assent
but
when
they
rose
from
the
table
she
said
nervously
could
speak
before
the
servants
i
wish
to
stay
here
till
the
afternoon
sidwell
have
asked
mr
peak
to
come
and
see
me
this
morning
her
mother
knew
that
expostulation
was
useless
but
could
not
refrain
from
a
long
harangue
made
up
of
warning
and
reproof
have
very
little
consideration
for
me
was
her
final
remark
we
sha
get
home
till
after
dark
and
of
course
my
throat
will
be
bad
again
glad
of
the
sidwell
replied
that
the
day
was
much
warmer
and
that
with
care
no
harm
need
come
of
the
journey
easy
to
say
that
sidwell
i
never
knew
you
to
behave
so
selfishly
never
be
angry
with
me
mother
you
do
know
how
grieved
i
am
to
distress
you
so
i
ca
help
it
dear
indeed
i
ca
wo
you
sacrifice
a
few
hours
to
put
my
mind
at
rest
warricombe
once
more
gave
expression
to
her
outraged
feelings
sidwell
could
only
listen
silently
with
bent
head
if
godwin
were
coming
at
all
he
would
be
here
by
eleven
sidwell
had
learnt
that
her
letter
was
put
into
his
hands
she
asked
him
to
come
at
once
and
nothing
but
a
resolve
not
to
meet
her
could
delay
him
more
than
an
hour
or
two
at
ten
the
bell
sounded
she
was
sitting
in
the
library
with
her
back
turned
to
the
door
when
a
voice
announced
peak
she
did
not
at
once
rise
and
with
a
feeling
akin
to
terror
she
heard
the
footstep
slowly
approaching
it
stopped
at
some
distance
from
her
then
overcoming
a
weakness
which
threatened
to
clog
her
as
in
a
nightmare
she
stood
up
and
looked
round
peak
wore
neither
overcoat
nor
gloves
but
otherwise
was
dressed
in
the
usual
way
as
sidwell
fixed
her
eyes
upon
him
he
threw
his
hat
into
a
chair
and
came
a
step
or
two
nearer
whether
he
had
passed
the
night
in
sleep
or
vigil
could
not
be
determined
but
his
look
was
one
of
shame
and
he
did
not
hold
himself
so
upright
as
was
his
wont
you
come
and
sit
down
said
sidwell
pointing
to
a
chair
not
far
from
that
on
which
one
of
her
hands
rested
he
moved
forward
and
was
about
to
pass
near
her
when
sidwell
involuntarily
held
her
hand
to
him
he
took
it
and
gazed
into
her
face
with
a
melancholy
smile
does
it
mean
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
he
relinquished
her
fingers
which
he
had
scarcely
pressed
and
stood
with
his
arms
behind
his
back
it
all
quite
true
was
his
reply
wearily
spoken
is
true
that
you
have
heard
from
your
brother
but
how
can
you
know
what
he
has
said
they
looked
at
each
other
peak
lips
were
set
as
if
in
resistance
of
emotion
and
a
frown
wrinkled
his
brows
sidwell
gaze
was
one
of
fear
and
appeal
said
of
course
that
i
had
deceived
you
in
what
was
there
no
truth
in
anything
you
said
to
me
you
i
have
spoken
far
more
truth
than
falsehood
a
light
shone
in
her
eyes
and
her
lips
quivered
she
murmured
was
not
right
in
everything
understand
he
wished
you
to
believe
that
my
love
was
as
much
a
pretence
as
my
religion
said
that
was
natural
and
you
were
disposed
to
believe
it
thought
it
impossible
but
i
should
have
thought
the
same
of
the
other
things
peak
nodded
and
moved
away
watching
him
sidwell
was
beset
with
conflicting
impulses
his
assurance
had
allayed
her
worst
misgiving
and
she
approved
the
with
which
he
bore
himself
but
at
the
same
time
she
longed
for
a
passionate
declaration
as
a
reasoning
woman
she
did
her
utmost
to
remember
that
peak
was
on
his
defence
before
her
and
that
nothing
could
pass
between
them
but
grave
discussion
of
the
motives
which
had
impelled
him
to
dishonourable
behaviour
as
a
woman
in
love
she
would
fain
have
obscured
the
moral
issue
by
indulgence
of
her
heart
desire
she
was
glad
that
he
held
aloof
but
if
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
she
would
have
forgotten
everything
in
the
moment
happiness
us
sit
down
and
tell
me
tell
me
all
you
can
he
delayed
a
moment
then
seated
himself
opposite
to
her
she
saw
now
that
his
movements
were
those
of
physical
fatigue
and
the
full
light
from
the
window
enabling
her
to
read
his
face
more
distinctly
revealed
the
impress
of
suffering
instead
of
calling
upon
him
to
atone
in
such
measure
as
was
possible
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
she
felt
ready
to
reproach
herself
for
speaking
coldly
when
his
need
of
solace
was
so
great
can
i
tell
you
he
said
you
do
know
or
that
you
conjecture
you
wrote
that
there
was
so
much
i
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
and
i
ca
ca
understand
you
it
still
seems
impossible
why
did
you
hide
the
truth
from
me
if
i
had
begun
by
telling
it
i
should
never
have
won
a
kind
look
or
a
kind
thought
from
you
sidwell
reflected
what
did
you
care
for
me
then
when
it
began
so
much
as
i
do
now
but
enough
to
overthrow
all
the
results
of
my
life
up
to
that
time
before
i
met
you
in
this
house
i
had
seen
you
twice
and
had
learned
who
you
were
i
was
sitting
in
the
cathedral
when
you
came
there
with
your
sister
and
miss
moorhouse
do
you
remember
i
heard
fanny
call
you
by
your
name
and
that
brought
to
my
mind
a
young
girl
whom
i
had
known
in
a
slight
way
years
before
and
the
next
day
i
again
saw
you
there
at
the
service
i
waited
about
the
entrance
only
to
see
you
i
cared
enough
for
you
then
to
conceive
a
design
which
for
a
long
time
seemed
too
hateful
really
to
be
carried
out
but
at
last
it
was
you
see
sidwell
breathed
quickly
nothing
he
could
have
urged
for
himself
would
have
affected
her
more
deeply
than
this
to
date
back
and
extend
the
period
of
his
love
for
her
was
a
flattery
more
subtle
than
peak
imagined
did
you
tell
me
that
the
day
before
yesterday
she
asked
with
tremulous
bosom
had
no
wish
to
remind
myself
of
baseness
in
the
midst
of
a
pure
joy
she
was
silent
then
exclaimed
in
accents
of
pain
should
you
have
thought
it
necessary
to
be
other
than
yourself
could
you
see
at
first
meeting
with
us
that
we
were
not
bigoted
people
did
you
know
that
buckland
had
accustomed
us
to
understand
how
common
it
is
nowadays
for
people
to
throw
off
the
old
religion
would
father
have
looked
coldly
on
you
if
he
had
known
that
you
followed
where
so
many
good
and
thoughtful
men
were
leading
he
regarded
her
anxiously
had
heard
from
buckland
that
your
father
was
strongly
prejudiced
that
you
also
were
quite
out
of
sympathy
with
the
new
thought
exaggerated
even
then
but
on
what
plea
could
i
have
come
to
live
in
this
neighbourhood
how
could
i
have
kept
you
in
sight
tried
to
win
your
interest
i
had
no
means
no
position
the
very
thought
of
encouraging
my
love
for
you
demanded
some
extraordinary
step
what
course
was
open
to
me
sidwell
let
her
head
droop
do
know
you
might
perhaps
have
discovered
a
way
what
was
the
use
when
the
mere
fact
of
my
heresy
would
have
forbidden
hope
from
the
outset
should
it
have
done
so
you
know
very
well
that
you
could
never
even
have
been
friendly
with
the
man
who
wrote
that
thing
in
the
review
here
is
the
proof
how
much
better
it
is
to
behave
truthfully
in
this
last
year
i
have
changed
so
much
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
strength
of
my
former
prejudices
what
is
it
to
me
now
that
you
speak
scornfully
of
attempts
to
reconcile
things
that
ca
be
reconciled
i
understand
the
new
thought
and
how
natural
it
is
for
you
to
accept
it
if
only
i
could
have
come
to
know
you
well
your
opinions
would
not
have
stood
between
us
peak
made
a
slight
gesture
and
smiled
incredulously
think
so
now
i
have
such
good
reason
for
my
thought
rejoined
sidwell
earnestly
when
you
said
you
loved
me
my
only
regret
in
looking
to
the
future
was
that
you
had
resolved
to
be
a
clergyman
he
leaned
back
in
the
chair
and
let
a
hand
fall
on
his
knee
the
gesture
seemed
to
signify
a
weary
relinquishment
of
concern
in
what
they
were
discussing
could
i
foresee
that
he
uttered
in
a
corresponding
tone
sidwell
was
made
uneasy
by
the
course
upon
which
she
had
entered
to
what
did
her
words
tend
if
only
to
a
demonstration
that
fate
had
used
him
as
the
plaything
of
its
irony
if
after
all
she
had
nothing
to
say
to
him
but
how
your
own
folly
has
ruined
you
then
she
had
better
have
kept
silence
she
not
only
appeared
to
be
offering
him
encouragement
but
was
in
truth
doing
so
she
wished
him
to
understand
that
his
way
of
thinking
was
no
obstacle
to
her
love
and
with
that
purpose
she
was
even
guilty
of
a
slight
misrepresentation
for
it
was
only
since
the
shock
of
this
disaster
that
she
had
clearly
recognised
the
change
in
her
own
mind
true
the
regret
of
which
she
spoke
had
for
an
instant
visited
her
but
it
represented
a
mundane
solicitude
rather
than
an
intellectual
scruple
it
had
occurred
to
her
how
much
brighter
would
be
their
prospect
if
peak
were
but
an
active
man
of
the
world
with
a
career
before
him
distinctly
suited
to
his
powers
his
contention
was
undeniably
just
the
influence
to
which
she
had
from
the
first
submitted
was
the
same
that
her
father
felt
so
strongly
godwin
interested
her
as
a
champion
of
the
old
faiths
and
his
personal
characteristics
would
never
have
awakened
such
sympathy
in
her
but
for
that
initial
recommendation
natural
prejudice
would
have
prevented
her
from
perceiving
the
points
of
kindred
between
his
temperament
and
her
own
his
low
origin
the
ridiculous
stories
connected
with
his
youth
why
had
she
in
spite
of
likelihood
been
able
to
disregard
these
things
only
because
of
what
she
then
deemed
his
spiritual
value
but
for
the
dishonourable
part
he
had
played
this
bond
of
love
would
never
have
been
formed
between
them
the
thought
was
a
new
apology
for
his
transgression
she
could
not
but
defy
her
conscience
and
look
indulgently
on
the
evil
which
had
borne
such
fruit
godwin
had
begun
to
speak
again
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
tenor
of
my
whole
life
whatever
i
undertake
ends
in
frustration
at
a
point
where
success
seems
to
have
just
come
within
my
reach
great
things
and
trifles
it
all
the
same
my
course
at
college
was
broken
off
at
the
moment
when
i
might
have
assured
my
future
later
i
made
many
an
effort
to
succeed
in
literature
and
when
at
length
something
of
mine
was
printed
in
a
leading
review
i
could
not
even
sign
it
and
had
no
profit
from
the
attention
it
excited
now
well
you
see
laughable
is
it
sidwell
scarcely
withheld
herself
from
bending
forward
and
giving
him
her
hand
shall
you
do
she
asked
i
am
not
afraid
i
have
still
enough
money
left
to
support
me
until
i
can
find
some
occupation
of
the
old
kind
fortunately
i
am
not
one
of
those
men
whose
brains
have
no
marketable
value
you
knew
how
it
pains
me
to
hear
you
i
did
believe
that
i
could
speak
to
you
like
this
i
never
thought
you
would
let
me
see
you
again
and
if
you
had
asked
me
to
come
i
could
never
have
brought
myself
to
face
you
but
it
would
have
been
a
miserable
thing
to
go
off
without
even
knowing
what
you
thought
of
me
you
never
have
written
to
me
think
not
you
find
it
hard
to
imagine
that
i
have
any
pride
no
doubt
but
it
is
there
explain
it
how
one
may
would
have
been
wrong
to
leave
me
in
such
uncertainty
you
about
your
future
you
quite
mean
that
had
your
brother
made
you
doubt
whether
i
loved
you
at
all
but
no
i
did
doubt
indeed
indeed
i
did
doubt
but
i
felt
such
a
need
of
hearing
from
your
own
lips
that
oh
i
explain
myself
godwin
smiled
sadly
think
i
understand
but
there
was
every
reason
for
my
believing
that
love
could
not
bear
such
a
test
you
must
regard
me
as
quite
a
different
man
one
utterly
unknown
to
you
he
had
resolved
to
speak
not
a
word
that
could
sound
like
an
appeal
to
her
emotions
when
he
entered
the
room
he
felt
a
sincere
indifference
as
to
what
would
result
from
the
interview
for
to
his
mind
the
story
was
ended
and
he
had
only
to
retire
with
the
dignity
still
possible
to
a
dishonoured
man
to
touch
the
note
of
pathos
would
be
unworthy
to
exert
what
influence
might
be
left
to
him
a
wanton
cruelty
but
he
had
heard
such
unexpected
things
that
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
remember
how
complete
had
seemed
the
severance
between
him
and
sidwell
the
charm
of
her
presence
was
reasserting
itself
and
when
avowal
of
continued
love
appeared
so
unmistakably
in
her
troubled
countenance
her
broken
words
he
could
not
control
the
answering
fervour
he
spoke
in
a
changed
voice
and
allowed
his
eyes
to
dwell
longingly
upon
hers
felt
so
at
first
she
answered
it
would
be
wrong
to
pretend
that
i
can
still
regard
you
as
i
did
before
it
cost
her
a
great
effort
to
add
these
words
when
they
were
spoken
she
was
at
once
glad
and
fearful
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
think
it
possible
said
peak
half
turning
away
that
is
no
reason
she
pursued
we
should
become
strangers
you
are
still
so
young
a
man
life
must
be
so
full
of
possibilities
for
you
this
year
has
been
wasted
but
when
you
leave
exeter
an
impatient
movement
of
godwin
checked
her
are
going
to
encourage
me
to
begin
the
struggle
once
more
he
said
bitterly
how
it
is
so
easy
to
talk
of
possibilities
are
not
without
friends
i
mean
friends
whose
sympathy
is
of
real
value
to
you
saying
this
she
looked
keenly
at
him
he
replied
perhaps
at
this
moment
are
laughing
over
my
disgrace
do
they
know
of
what
has
happened
did
your
brother
get
his
information
i
did
care
to
ask
no
i
do
even
wish
you
to
say
anything
about
that
surely
there
is
no
reason
for
keeping
it
secret
why
may
i
not
speak
freely
buckland
told
me
that
he
had
heard
you
spoken
of
at
the
house
of
people
named
moxey
she
endeavoured
to
understand
the
smile
which
rose
to
his
lips
it
is
clear
to
me
he
said
i
suppose
that
was
inevitable
sooner
or
later
knew
that
he
had
become
acquainted
with
the
moxeys
her
tone
was
more
reserved
than
hitherto
i
knew
he
had
he
met
miss
moxey
by
chance
at
budleigh
salterton
and
i
happened
to
be
there
at
the
moorhouses
on
the
same
day
sidwell
glanced
at
him
inquiringly
and
waited
for
something
more
saw
miss
moxey
in
private
he
added
speaking
more
quickly
asked
her
to
keep
my
secret
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
this
but
it
is
better
you
should
know
how
far
my
humiliation
has
gone
he
saw
that
she
was
moved
with
strong
feeling
the
low
tone
in
which
she
answered
had
peculiar
significance
you
speak
of
me
to
miss
moxey
must
forgive
you
for
asking
that
peak
replied
coldly
may
well
seem
to
you
that
i
have
neither
honour
nor
delicacy
left
there
had
come
a
flush
on
her
cheeks
for
some
moments
she
was
absorbed
in
thought
seems
strange
to
you
he
continued
at
length
i
could
ask
miss
moxey
to
share
such
a
secret
but
you
must
understand
on
what
terms
we
were
she
and
i
we
have
known
each
other
for
several
years
she
has
a
man
mind
and
i
have
always
thought
of
her
in
much
the
same
way
as
of
my
male
your
brother
has
told
you
about
her
perhaps
have
met
her
in
london
that
will
make
my
explanation
easier
said
godwin
disregarding
the
anxious
questions
that
at
once
suggested
themselves
to
him
i
misled
her
or
tried
to
do
so
i
allowed
her
to
suppose
that
i
was
sincere
in
my
new
undertakings
and
that
i
did
wish
oh
he
exclaimed
suddenly
breaking
off
need
i
go
any
further
in
confession
it
must
be
as
miserable
for
you
to
hear
as
for
me
to
speak
let
us
make
an
end
of
it
i
ca
understand
how
i
have
escaped
detection
so
long
remembering
every
detail
of
buckland
story
sidwell
felt
that
she
had
possibly
been
unjust
in
representing
the
moxeys
as
her
authority
in
strictness
she
ought
to
mention
that
a
friend
of
theirs
was
the
actual
source
of
information
but
she
could
not
pursue
the
subject
like
godwin
she
wished
to
put
it
out
of
her
mind
what
question
could
there
be
of
honour
or
dishonour
in
the
case
of
a
person
such
as
miss
moxey
who
had
consented
to
be
party
to
a
shameful
deceit
strangely
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
have
heard
this
the
moral
repugnance
which
threatened
to
estrange
her
from
godwin
was
now
directed
in
another
quarter
unduly
restrained
by
love
it
found
scope
under
the
guidance
of
jealousy
have
been
trying
to
adapt
yourself
she
said
a
world
for
which
you
are
by
nature
unfitted
your
place
is
in
the
new
order
by
turning
back
to
the
old
you
condemned
yourself
to
a
wasted
life
since
we
have
been
in
london
i
have
come
to
understand
better
the
great
difference
between
modern
intellectual
life
and
that
which
we
lead
in
these
corners
you
must
go
out
among
your
equals
go
and
take
your
part
with
men
who
are
working
for
the
future
peak
rose
with
a
gesture
of
passionate
impatience
is
it
to
me
new
world
or
old
my
world
is
where
are
i
have
no
life
of
my
own
i
think
only
of
you
live
only
by
you
i
could
help
you
she
replied
with
emotion
can
i
do
but
be
your
friend
at
a
distance
everything
else
has
become
impossible
for
the
present
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
is
there
no
hope
for
me
she
pressed
her
hands
together
and
stood
before
him
unable
to
answer
he
continued
you
are
almost
as
much
changed
in
my
eyes
as
i
in
yours
i
did
not
imagine
that
you
had
moved
so
far
towards
freedom
of
mind
if
my
love
for
you
was
profound
and
absorbing
think
what
it
must
now
have
become
yours
has
suffered
by
my
disgrace
but
is
there
no
hope
of
its
reviving
if
i
live
worthily
if
i
his
voice
failed
have
said
that
we
ca
be
strangers
sidwell
murmured
brokenly
you
go
i
must
hear
of
you
about
you
will
detest
my
name
you
will
soon
wish
to
forget
my
existence
i
know
myself
never
oh
try
to
find
your
true
work
you
have
such
abilities
powers
so
much
greater
than
those
of
ordinary
men
you
will
always
be
the
same
to
me
and
if
ever
circumstances
would
have
to
give
up
so
much
sidwell
and
there
is
little
chance
of
my
ever
being
poverty
will
always
stand
between
us
if
nothing
else
must
be
so
long
before
we
can
think
of
that
can
i
ever
see
you
no
i
wo
ask
that
who
knows
i
may
have
to
go
too
far
away
but
i
write
to
you
after
a
time
shall
live
in
the
hope
of
good
news
from
you
she
replied
trying
to
smile
and
to
speak
cheerfully
will
always
be
my
home
nothing
will
be
changed
you
do
think
of
me
as
irredeemably
base
i
thought
you
base
sidwell
answered
in
a
low
voice
should
not
now
be
speaking
with
you
it
is
because
i
feel
and
know
that
you
have
erred
only
that
is
what
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
think
of
your
fault
as
outweighing
the
good
in
your
nature
good
i
wonder
how
you
understand
that
what
is
there
in
me
you
do
mean
mere
intellect
he
waited
anxiously
for
what
she
would
say
a
necessity
for
speaking
out
his
inmost
thoughts
had
arisen
with
the
emotion
scarcely
to
be
called
hope
excited
by
sidwell
magnanimity
now
or
never
he
must
stand
before
this
woman
as
his
very
self
and
be
convinced
that
she
loved
him
for
his
own
sake
i
do
mean
intellect
she
replied
with
hesitation
then
tell
me
of
one
quality
in
me
strong
enough
to
justify
a
woman
love
sidwell
dropped
her
eyes
in
confusion
ca
analyse
your
character
i
only
know
she
became
silent
myself
pursued
godwin
with
the
modulated
moving
voice
which
always
expressed
his
genuine
feeling
seem
anything
but
lovable
i
do
underrate
my
powers
rather
the
opposite
no
doubt
but
what
i
always
seem
to
lack
is
the
gift
of
pleasing
moral
grace
my
strongest
emotions
seem
to
be
absorbed
in
revolt
for
once
that
i
feel
tenderly
i
have
a
hundred
fierce
resentful
tempestuous
moods
to
be
suave
and
smiling
in
common
intercourse
costs
me
an
effort
i
have
to
act
the
part
and
this
habit
makes
me
sceptical
whenever
i
am
really
prompted
to
gentleness
i
criticise
myself
ceaselessly
expose
without
mercy
all
those
characteristics
which
another
man
would
keep
out
of
sight
yes
and
for
this
very
reason
just
because
i
think
myself
unlovable
the
gift
of
love
means
far
more
to
me
than
to
other
men
if
you
could
conceive
the
passion
of
gratitude
which
possessed
me
for
hours
after
i
left
you
the
other
day
you
can
not
sidwell
regarded
him
fixedly
comparison
with
this
sincerity
what
becomes
of
the
pretence
you
blame
in
me
if
you
knew
how
paltry
it
seems
that
accusation
of
dishonesty
i
believed
the
world
round
and
pretended
to
believe
it
flat
that
what
it
amounts
to
are
you
on
such
an
account
as
that
to
consider
worthless
the
devotion
which
has
grown
in
me
month
by
month
you
i
was
persuaded
thought
the
world
flat
and
could
think
kindly
of
any
man
who
held
the
other
hypothesis
very
well
why
not
concede
the
trifle
and
so
at
least
give
myself
a
chance
i
did
so
that
was
all
in
vain
her
conscience
strove
to
assert
itself
she
was
under
the
spell
of
a
nature
infinitely
stronger
than
hers
she
saw
and
felt
as
godwin
did
think
sidwell
that
i
stand
in
need
of
forgiveness
then
be
great
enough
to
forgive
me
wholly
once
and
for
all
let
your
love
be
strengthened
by
the
trial
it
has
passed
through
that
will
mean
that
my
whole
life
is
yours
directed
by
the
thought
of
your
beauty
face
and
soul
then
there
be
good
in
me
thanks
to
you
i
shall
no
longer
live
a
life
of
hypocrisy
of
suppressed
rage
and
scorn
i
know
how
much
i
am
asking
perhaps
it
means
that
for
my
sake
you
give
up
everything
else
that
is
dear
to
you
the
thought
checked
him
he
looked
at
her
despondently
can
trust
me
sidwell
answered
moving
nearer
to
him
tears
on
her
cheeks
must
hear
from
you
and
i
will
write
can
ask
no
more
than
that
he
took
her
hands
held
them
for
a
moment
and
turned
away
at
the
door
he
looked
round
sidwell
head
was
bowed
and
on
her
raising
it
he
saw
that
she
was
blinded
with
tears
so
he
went
forth
part
vi
chapter
i
for
several
days
after
the
scene
in
which
malkin
unconsciously
played
an
important
part
marcella
seemed
to
be
she
appeared
at
meals
but
neither
ate
nor
conversed
christian
had
never
known
her
so
sullen
and
nervously
irritable
he
did
not
venture
to
utter
name
upon
seclusion
followed
restless
activity
marcella
was
rarely
at
home
between
breakfast
and
and
her
brother
learnt
with
satisfaction
that
she
went
much
among
her
acquaintances
late
one
evening
when
he
had
just
returned
from
he
knew
not
where
christian
tried
to
put
an
end
to
the
unnatural
constraint
between
them
after
talking
cheerfully
for
a
few
minutes
he
risked
the
question
you
seen
anything
of
the
warricombes
she
replied
with
a
cold
negative
heard
anything
have
you
at
all
i
have
seen
earwaker
malkin
had
told
him
about
what
happened
here
the
other
day
course
he
had
no
of
peak
i
mean
marcella
smiled
as
if
the
situation
amused
her
but
she
would
not
discuss
it
christian
began
to
hope
that
she
was
training
herself
to
a
wholesome
indifference
a
month
of
the
new
year
went
by
and
peak
seemed
to
be
forgotten
marcella
had
returned
to
her
studious
habits
was
fenced
around
with
books
seldom
left
the
house
another
month
and
the
brother
and
sister
were
living
very
much
in
the
old
way
seeing
few
people
conversing
only
of
intellectual
things
but
christian
concealed
an
expectation
which
enabled
him
to
pass
hours
of
retirement
in
the
completest
idleness
since
the
death
of
her
husband
palmer
had
been
living
abroad
before
the
end
of
march
as
he
had
been
careful
to
discover
she
would
be
back
in
london
at
the
house
in
sussex
square
by
that
time
he
might
venture
without
indelicacy
to
call
upon
her
and
after
the
first
interview
the
day
came
when
ill
with
agitation
he
set
forth
to
pay
this
call
for
two
or
three
nights
he
had
scarcely
closed
his
eyes
he
looked
ghastly
the
weather
was
execrable
and
on
that
very
account
he
made
choice
of
this
afternoon
hoping
that
he
might
find
his
widowed
laura
alone
between
ringing
the
bell
and
the
opening
of
the
door
he
could
hardly
support
himself
he
asked
for
palmer
in
a
gasping
voice
which
caused
the
servant
to
look
at
him
with
surprise
the
lady
was
at
home
at
the
door
before
his
name
could
be
announced
he
caught
the
unwelcome
sound
of
voices
in
lively
conversation
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
score
of
persons
were
assembled
in
reality
there
were
six
three
of
them
callers
palmer
met
him
with
the
friendliest
welcome
a
stranger
would
have
thought
her
pretty
but
by
no
means
impressive
she
was
short
anything
but
meagre
brisk
of
movement
idly
vivacious
in
look
and
tone
the
mourning
she
wore
imposed
no
restraint
upon
her
humour
which
at
present
was
not
far
from
gay
it
really
mr
moxey
she
exclaimed
i
had
all
but
forgotten
you
and
positively
it
is
your
own
fault
it
must
be
a
year
or
more
since
you
came
to
see
me
no
eight
months
but
i
have
been
through
so
much
trouble
you
know
she
sighed
mechanically
thought
of
you
one
day
at
bordighera
when
we
were
looking
at
some
funny
little
the
kind
of
thing
you
used
to
know
all
about
how
is
your
sister
a
chill
struck
upon
his
heart
assuredly
he
had
no
wish
to
find
constance
sunk
in
the
semblance
of
dolour
such
hypocrisy
would
have
pained
him
but
her
sprightliness
was
a
shock
though
months
had
passed
since
palmer
decease
a
decent
gravity
would
more
have
become
her
condition
he
could
reply
only
in
broken
phrases
and
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
the
widow
as
if
tiring
of
his
awkwardness
turned
her
attention
elsewhere
he
was
at
length
able
to
survey
the
company
two
ladies
in
mourning
he
faintly
recognised
the
one
a
sister
of
palmer
comely
but
of
dull
aspect
the
other
a
niece
whose
laugh
was
too
frequent
even
had
it
been
more
musical
and
who
talked
of
athletic
sports
with
a
young
man
evidently
better
fitted
to
excel
in
that
kind
of
thing
than
in
any
pursuit
demanding
intelligence
this
gentleman
christian
had
never
met
the
two
other
callers
a
person
and
a
lady
possibly
his
wife
were
equally
strangers
to
him
the
was
much
changed
in
appearance
since
christian
last
visit
there
was
more
display
a
richer
profusion
of
ornaments
not
in
the
best
taste
the
old
pictures
had
given
place
to
daubs
of
the
most
popular
school
on
a
little
table
at
his
elbow
he
remarked
the
photograph
of
a
jockey
who
was
just
then
engrossing
public
affection
what
did
all
this
mean
formerly
he
had
attributed
every
graceful
feature
of
the
room
to
constance
choice
he
had
imagined
that
to
her
palmer
was
indebted
for
guidance
on
points
of
aesthetic
propriety
could
it
be
that
he
caught
a
glance
which
she
cast
in
his
direction
and
instantly
forgot
the
troublesome
problem
how
dull
of
him
to
misunderstand
her
her
sportiveness
had
a
double
significance
it
was
the
expression
of
a
hope
which
would
not
be
subdued
and
at
the
same
time
a
means
of
disguising
the
tender
interest
with
which
she
regarded
if
she
had
been
blithe
before
his
appearance
how
could
she
suddenly
change
her
demeanour
as
soon
as
he
entered
it
would
have
challenged
suspicion
and
remark
for
the
same
reason
she
affected
to
have
all
but
forgotten
him
of
course
how
could
he
have
failed
to
see
that
thought
of
you
one
day
at
bordighera
was
not
that
the
best
possible
way
of
making
known
to
him
that
he
had
never
been
out
of
her
mind
sweet
noble
constance
he
took
a
place
by
her
sister
and
began
to
talk
of
he
knew
not
what
for
all
his
attention
was
given
to
the
sound
of
constance
voice
she
was
saying
to
the
man
of
military
appearance
very
early
to
come
back
to
london
but
i
did
get
so
tired
of
those
foreign
places
in
other
words
of
being
far
from
her
christian
thus
he
interpreted
we
did
make
a
single
pleasant
acquaintance
a
shockingly
tiresome
lot
of
people
wherever
we
went
in
comparison
with
the
faithful
lover
who
waited
waited
are
so
stupid
do
you
think
so
why
should
they
always
expect
you
to
speak
language
oh
of
course
i
speak
french
but
it
is
such
a
disagreeable
language
do
you
think
so
compared
with
the
accents
of
english
devotion
of
course
you
go
in
for
cycling
mr
moxey
inquired
palmer
laughing
niece
from
a
little
distance
cycling
with
a
great
effort
he
recovered
himself
and
grasped
the
meaning
of
the
words
i
i
sorry
to
say
i
do
capital
exercise
dwight
has
just
been
telling
me
such
an
awfully
good
story
about
a
friend
of
his
do
tell
it
again
dwight
it
make
you
laugh
no
end
mr
moxey
the
young
man
appealed
to
was
ready
enough
to
repeat
his
anecdote
which
had
to
do
with
a
bold
cyclist
who
after
dining
more
than
well
rode
his
machine
down
a
steep
hill
and
escaped
destruction
only
by
miracle
christian
laughed
desperately
and
declared
that
he
had
never
heard
anything
so
good
but
the
tension
of
his
nerves
was
unendurable
five
minutes
more
of
anguish
and
he
sprang
up
like
an
automaton
you
really
go
mr
moxey
said
constance
with
a
manner
which
of
course
was
intended
to
veil
her
emotion
do
be
another
year
before
you
let
us
see
you
again
blessings
on
her
tender
heart
what
more
could
she
have
said
in
the
presence
of
all
those
people
he
walked
all
the
way
to
notting
hill
through
a
pelting
rain
his
passion
aglow
impossible
to
be
silent
longer
concerning
the
brilliant
future
arrived
at
home
he
flung
off
hat
and
coat
and
went
straight
to
the
hoping
to
find
marcella
alone
to
his
annoyance
a
stranger
was
sitting
there
in
conversation
a
very
simply
dressed
lady
who
as
he
entered
looked
at
him
with
a
grave
smile
and
stood
up
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
before
marcella
wore
a
singular
expression
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
for
christian
decidedly
embarrassing
since
it
seemed
to
be
expected
that
he
should
greet
the
stranger
you
remember
janet
said
his
sister
he
felt
his
face
flush
do
mean
to
say
but
how
you
have
altered
and
yet
no
really
you
have
it
only
my
stupidity
he
grasped
her
hand
and
with
a
feeling
of
genuine
pleasure
despite
awkward
reminiscences
does
alter
in
eleven
years
said
janet
moxey
in
a
very
pleasant
natural
voice
a
voice
of
habitual
conveying
the
idea
of
a
highly
cultivated
mind
and
many
other
agreeable
things
years
yes
yes
how
very
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
i
sure
marcella
was
how
very
kind
of
you
to
call
on
us
janet
was
as
far
as
ever
from
looking
handsome
or
pretty
but
it
must
have
been
a
dullard
who
proclaimed
her
face
unpleasing
she
had
eyes
of
remarkable
intelligence
something
like
marcella
but
milder
more
benevolent
her
lips
were
softly
firm
they
would
not
readily
part
in
laughter
their
frequent
smile
meant
more
than
that
of
the
woman
who
sets
herself
to
be
engaging
am
on
my
way
home
she
said
a
holiday
in
the
south
an
enforced
holiday
i
sorry
to
say
have
been
ill
a
little
i
am
practising
medicine
in
kingsmill
christian
did
not
disguise
his
astonishment
do
remember
that
i
always
had
scientific
tastes
if
it
was
a
reproach
none
could
have
been
more
gently
administered
course
of
course
i
do
your
botany
your
skeletons
of
birds
and
cats
and
mice
of
course
but
where
did
you
study
london
the
women
medical
school
i
have
been
in
practice
for
nearly
four
years
have
overworked
but
why
are
we
standing
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
how
is
your
father
marcella
was
watching
her
brother
closely
and
with
a
curious
smile
janet
remained
for
another
hour
no
reference
was
made
to
the
long
rupture
of
intercourse
between
her
family
and
these
relatives
christian
learnt
that
his
uncle
was
still
hale
and
that
janet
four
sisters
all
lived
obviously
unmarried
he
was
disposed
to
be
almost
affectionate
with
anyone
who
showed
him
a
friendly
face
he
expressed
grief
that
his
cousin
must
leave
for
twybridge
early
in
the
morning
you
pass
through
the
midlands
was
janet
indirect
reply
addressed
to
marcella
to
stop
at
kingsmill
and
a
few
minutes
after
that
she
took
her
leave
there
lingered
behind
her
that
peculiar
fragrance
of
modern
womanhood
refreshing
inspiriting
which
is
so
entirely
different
from
the
merely
feminine
perfume
however
exquisite
a
surprising
visit
was
christian
exclamation
when
he
and
his
sister
were
alone
did
she
find
us
i
suppose
lady
doctor
he
mused
a
very
capable
one
i
fancy
said
marcella
had
nearly
an
hour
talk
before
you
came
but
she
wo
be
able
to
stand
the
work
there
be
another
breakdown
before
long
she
a
large
practice
then
very
large
perhaps
but
she
studies
as
well
i
never
dreamt
of
janet
becoming
so
interesting
a
person
christian
had
to
postpone
till
after
dinner
the
talk
he
purposed
about
palmer
when
that
time
came
he
was
no
longer
disposed
for
sentimental
confessions
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
he
could
announce
a
settled
project
of
marriage
through
the
evening
his
sister
recurred
to
the
subject
of
janet
with
curious
frequency
and
on
the
following
day
her
interest
had
suffered
no
diminution
christian
had
always
taken
for
granted
that
she
understood
the
grounds
of
the
breach
between
him
and
his
uncle
without
ever
unbosoming
himself
he
had
occasionally
in
his
softer
moments
alluded
to
the
awkward
subject
in
language
which
he
thought
easy
enough
to
interpret
now
at
length
in
reply
to
some
remark
of
marcella
he
said
with
significant
accent
was
very
friendly
to
me
has
studied
science
for
ten
years
was
his
sister
comment
and
can
forgive
a
boy
absurdities
to
forgive
certainly
than
those
of
a
man
said
marcella
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
christian
became
silent
and
went
thoughtfully
away
a
week
later
he
was
again
in
palmer
where
again
he
met
an
assemblage
of
people
such
as
seemed
to
profane
this
sanctuary
to
be
sure
he
said
to
himself
constance
could
not
at
once
get
rid
of
the
acquaintances
forced
upon
her
by
her
husband
little
by
little
she
would
free
herself
it
was
a
pity
that
her
sister
and
her
niece
persons
anything
but
intelligent
and
refined
should
be
permanent
members
of
her
household
for
their
sake
no
doubt
she
felt
constrained
to
welcome
men
and
women
for
whose
society
she
herself
had
little
taste
but
when
the
year
of
her
widowhood
was
past
laura
was
the
mother
of
eleven
children
constance
had
had
only
three
and
one
of
these
was
dead
the
remaining
two
christian
now
learnt
lived
with
a
governess
in
a
little
house
at
bournemouth
which
palmer
had
taken
for
that
purpose
going
down
to
see
them
she
informed
christian
i
shall
stay
there
over
the
next
day
it
so
quiet
and
restful
these
words
kept
repeating
themselves
to
christian
ear
as
he
went
home
and
all
through
the
evening
were
they
not
an
invitation
down
there
at
bournemouth
constance
would
be
alone
the
day
after
is
so
quiet
and
restful
that
was
to
say
no
idle
callers
would
break
upon
her
retirement
she
would
be
able
to
welcome
a
friend
and
talk
reposefully
with
him
surely
she
must
have
meant
that
for
she
spoke
with
a
peculiar
intonation
a
look
by
the
second
morning
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
a
persuasion
that
yonder
by
the
seaside
constance
was
expecting
him
to
miss
the
opportunity
would
be
to
prove
himself
dull
of
apprehension
a
laggard
in
love
with
trembling
hands
he
hurried
through
his
toilet
and
made
haste
downstairs
to
examine
a
railway
he
found
it
was
possible
to
reach
bournemouth
by
about
two
a
very
convenient
hour
it
would
allow
him
to
take
refreshment
and
walk
to
the
house
shortly
after
three
his
conviction
strong
as
ever
he
came
to
the
journey
end
and
in
due
course
discovered
the
pleasant
little
house
of
which
constance
had
spoken
at
the
door
his
heart
failed
him
but
retreat
could
not
now
be
thought
of
yes
palmer
was
at
home
the
servant
led
him
into
a
on
the
ground
floor
took
his
name
and
left
him
it
was
nearly
ten
minutes
before
constance
appeared
on
her
face
he
read
a
frank
surprise
happened
to
to
be
down
here
could
resist
the
temptation
to
see
you
moxey
but
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
he
gazed
at
her
do
you
remember
the
day
before
yesterday
in
sussex
square
you
mentioned
did
i
she
laughed
had
quite
forgotten
christian
sank
upon
his
chair
he
tried
to
convince
himself
that
she
was
playing
a
part
perhaps
she
thought
that
she
had
been
premature
in
revealing
her
wish
to
talk
with
him
palmer
was
this
call
evidently
puzzled
her
but
she
did
not
stint
her
hospitality
when
christian
asked
after
the
children
they
were
summoned
two
little
girls
daintily
dressed
pretty
affectionate
with
their
mother
the
sight
of
them
tortured
christian
and
he
sighed
deeply
with
relief
when
they
left
the
room
constance
appeared
rather
absent
her
quick
glance
at
him
signified
something
but
he
could
not
determine
what
in
agony
of
constraint
he
rose
as
if
to
go
you
will
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
me
said
palmer
will
be
brought
in
a
few
minutes
then
she
really
wished
him
to
stop
was
he
not
behaving
like
an
obtuse
creature
why
everything
was
planned
to
encourage
him
he
talked
recklessly
of
this
and
that
and
got
round
to
the
years
long
gone
by
when
the
tea
came
he
was
reviving
memories
of
occasions
on
which
he
and
she
had
met
as
young
people
constance
laughed
merrily
declared
she
could
hardly
remember
what
a
time
ago
but
i
was
quite
a
child
indeed
no
you
were
a
young
lady
and
a
brilliant
one
the
tea
seemed
to
intoxicate
him
he
noticed
again
that
constance
glanced
at
him
significantly
how
good
of
her
to
allow
him
this
delicious
afternoon
moxey
she
said
after
meditating
a
little
have
you
married
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
married
long
ago
he
was
stricken
dumb
her
jerky
laugh
came
as
a
shock
upon
his
hearing
is
there
astonishing
in
the
idea
i
how
can
i
answer
you
the
pretty
characterless
face
betrayed
some
unusual
feeling
she
looked
at
him
furtively
seemed
to
suppress
a
tendency
to
laugh
must
pry
into
secrets
she
simpered
there
is
no
secret
christian
panted
laying
down
his
teacup
for
fear
he
should
drop
it
should
i
could
i
have
married
constance
also
put
aside
her
cup
she
was
bewildered
and
just
a
little
abashed
with
courage
which
came
he
knew
not
whence
christian
bent
forward
and
continued
speaking
could
i
marry
after
that
day
when
i
met
you
in
the
little
at
the
robinsons
she
stared
in
genuine
astonishment
then
was
embarrassed
can
not
can
not
have
forgotten
surely
do
mean
to
say
moxey
that
you
have
remembered
oh
i
afraid
i
was
a
shocking
flirt
in
those
days
i
mean
your
marriage
when
i
found
you
in
tears
please
do
remind
me
she
exclaimed
giggling
nervously
how
silly
of
me
i
mean
to
think
that
but
you
are
making
fun
of
me
mr
moxey
christian
rose
and
went
to
the
window
he
was
not
only
shaken
by
his
tender
emotions
something
very
like
repugnance
had
begun
to
affect
him
if
constance
were
feigning
it
was
in
very
bad
taste
if
she
spoke
with
sincerity
what
a
woman
had
he
worshipped
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
lay
the
fault
upon
his
own
absurd
romanticism
after
eleven
persistence
in
one
point
of
view
he
could
not
suddenly
see
the
affair
with
the
eyes
of
common
sense
he
turned
and
approached
her
again
you
not
know
then
he
asked
with
quiet
dignity
ever
since
the
day
i
speak
of
i
have
devoted
my
life
to
the
love
i
then
felt
all
these
years
have
you
not
understood
me
palmer
was
quite
unable
to
grasp
ideas
such
as
these
neither
her
reading
nor
her
experience
prepared
her
to
understand
what
christian
meant
courtship
of
a
married
woman
was
intelligible
enough
to
her
but
a
love
that
feared
to
soil
itself
a
devotion
from
afar
encouraged
by
only
the
faintest
hope
of
reward
other
than
the
most
insubstantial
of
that
she
had
as
little
conception
as
any
woman
among
the
wealthy
vulgar
you
really
mean
moxey
that
you
have
kept
unmarried
for
sake
do
know
that
he
asked
hoarsely
could
i
how
was
i
to
imagine
such
a
thing
really
was
it
proper
how
could
you
expect
me
mr
moxey
for
a
moment
she
looked
offended
but
her
real
feelings
were
astonishment
and
amusement
not
unmingled
with
an
idle
gratification
must
ask
you
to
pardon
me
said
christian
whose
forehead
gleamed
with
moisture
do
say
that
i
am
really
so
sorry
what
an
odd
mistake
i
have
hoped
in
vain
since
you
were
free
you
must
say
such
things
i
shall
never
dream
of
marrying
again
never
there
was
a
vigour
in
the
assertion
which
proved
that
palmer
spoke
her
genuine
thought
the
tone
could
not
be
interpreted
as
devotion
to
her
husband
memory
it
meant
plainly
and
simply
that
she
had
had
enough
of
marriage
and
delighted
in
her
freedom
christian
could
not
say
another
word
disillusion
was
complete
the
voice
the
face
were
those
of
as
unspiritual
a
woman
as
he
could
easily
have
met
with
and
his
life
story
was
that
of
a
fool
he
took
his
hat
held
out
his
hand
with
mrs
palmer
the
cold
politeness
left
her
no
choice
but
again
to
look
offended
and
with
merely
a
motion
of
the
head
she
replied
mr
moxey
and
therewith
permitted
him
to
leave
the
house
chapter
ii
on
calling
at
earwaker
chambers
one
february
evening
malkin
became
aware
from
the
very
threshold
of
the
outer
door
that
the
domicile
was
not
as
he
had
known
it
with
the
familiar
fragrance
of
special
blended
a
suggestion
of
new
upholstery
the
little
vestibule
had
somehow
put
off
its
dinginess
and
an
unwontedly
brilliant
light
from
the
revealed
changes
of
the
interior
which
the
visitor
remarked
with
frank
astonishment
the
deuce
has
it
happened
at
last
are
you
going
to
be
married
he
cried
staring
about
him
at
unrecognised
chairs
tables
and
bookcases
at
whitened
ceiling
and
pleasantly
papered
walls
at
pictures
and
ornaments
which
he
knew
not
the
journalist
shook
his
head
and
smiled
contentedly
idea
that
came
to
me
all
at
once
my
editorship
seemed
to
inspire
it
after
a
year
of
waiting
upon
providence
earwaker
had
received
the
offer
of
a
substantial
appointment
much
more
to
his
taste
than
those
he
had
previously
held
he
was
now
literary
editor
of
a
weekly
review
which
made
no
kind
of
appeal
to
the
untaught
multitude
have
decided
to
dwell
here
for
the
rest
of
my
life
he
added
looking
round
the
walls
must
have
a
homestead
and
this
shall
be
mine
here
i
have
set
up
my
penates
it
a
portion
of
space
you
know
and
what
more
can
be
said
of
longleat
or
chatsworth
a
house
i
shall
never
want
because
i
shall
never
have
a
wife
and
on
the
whole
i
prefer
this
situation
to
any
other
i
am
well
within
reach
of
everything
urban
that
i
care
about
and
as
for
the
country
that
is
too
good
to
be
put
to
common
use
let
it
be
kept
for
holiday
there
an
atmosphere
in
the
old
inns
that
pleases
me
the
new
flats
are
insufferable
how
can
one
live
sandwiched
between
a
singer
and
a
female
politician
for
lodgings
of
any
kind
no
sane
man
had
ever
a
word
of
approval
reflecting
on
all
these
things
i
have
established
myself
in
perpetuity
what
i
ca
do
exclaimed
malkin
flinging
himself
into
a
broad
deep
chair
i
have
leanings
that
way
only
a
few
days
ago
i
sat
for
a
whole
evening
with
the
map
of
england
open
before
me
wondering
where
would
be
the
best
place
to
settle
down
a
few
years
hence
i
mean
you
know
when
bella
is
old
that
reminds
me
next
sunday
is
her
birthday
and
do
you
know
what
i
wish
you
go
down
to
wrotham
with
me
thanks
but
i
think
i
had
better
not
but
do
i
want
you
to
see
how
bella
is
getting
on
she
grown
wonderfully
since
you
saw
her
in
paris
an
inch
taller
i
should
think
i
do
go
down
there
very
often
you
know
so
i
notice
these
changes
really
i
think
no
one
could
be
more
discreet
than
i
am
under
the
circumstances
a
friend
of
the
family
that
all
just
dropping
in
for
a
casual
cup
of
tea
now
and
then
sunday
will
be
a
special
occasion
of
course
i
say
what
are
your
views
about
early
marriage
do
you
think
seventeen
too
young
should
think
much
better
malkin
broke
into
fretfulness
me
tell
you
earwaker
i
do
like
the
way
you
habitually
speak
of
this
project
of
mine
plainly
i
do
like
it
it
a
very
serious
matter
indeed
eh
what
why
are
you
smiling
agree
with
you
as
to
its
seriousness
yes
but
in
a
very
cynical
and
offensive
way
it
makes
me
confoundedly
uncomfortable
let
me
tell
you
i
do
think
that
very
friendly
on
your
part
and
the
fact
is
if
it
goes
on
i
very
much
afraid
we
sha
see
so
much
of
each
other
as
we
have
done
i
like
you
earwaker
and
i
respect
you
i
think
you
know
that
but
occasionally
you
seem
to
have
too
little
regard
for
one
feelings
no
i
do
feel
able
to
pass
it
over
with
a
there
the
deuce
take
it
bitten
off
the
end
of
my
pipe
he
spat
out
a
piece
of
amber
and
looked
ruefully
at
the
broken
stem
a
cigar
said
earwaker
fetching
a
box
from
a
cupboard
do
well
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
i
was
quarrelling
with
you
now
look
here
what
fault
have
you
to
find
with
bella
jacox
whatever
she
seemed
to
me
a
very
amiable
child
pooh
pshaw
and
fifteen
next
sunday
i
tell
you
she
a
young
lady
and
to
tell
you
the
confounded
plain
truth
i
in
love
with
her
i
am
and
there
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
if
you
smile
we
shall
quarrel
i
warn
you
earwaker
we
shall
quarrel
the
journalist
instead
of
smiling
gave
forth
his
deepest
laugh
malkin
turned
very
red
scowled
and
threw
his
cigar
aside
really
wish
me
to
go
on
sunday
earwaker
asked
in
a
pleasant
voice
the
other
countenance
immediately
cleared
shall
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
jacox
will
be
delighted
meet
me
at
holborn
viaduct
at
no
to
make
sure
i
come
here
at
one
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
chatting
as
unconcernedly
as
ever
of
settling
down
my
brother
tom
and
his
wife
are
on
the
point
of
going
to
new
zealand
necessity
of
business
may
be
out
there
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
do
you
know
that
i
shall
think
very
seriously
of
following
them
some
day
with
bella
you
know
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
do
believe
i
could
ever
make
a
solid
home
in
england
why
i
ca
quite
say
partly
i
suppose
because
i
have
nothing
to
do
now
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
going
out
to
the
colonies
a
man
feels
that
he
is
helping
the
spread
of
civilisation
and
something
you
know
i
should
compare
myself
with
the
greek
and
roman
colonists
something
inspiriting
in
that
thought
what
why
should
i
found
a
respectable
newspaper
for
instance
yes
i
shall
think
very
seriously
of
this
would
care
to
run
over
with
your
relatives
just
to
have
a
look
occurred
to
me
malkin
replied
thoughtfully
they
sail
in
ten
days
and
well
i
afraid
i
could
get
ready
in
time
and
then
i
promised
to
look
after
some
little
affairs
for
jacox
some
trifling
money
matters
but
later
in
the
year
who
knows
earwaker
half
repented
of
his
promise
to
visit
the
jacox
household
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
excusing
himself
so
on
sunday
he
journeyed
with
his
friend
down
to
wrotham
jacox
and
her
children
were
very
comfortably
established
in
a
small
new
house
when
the
companions
entered
they
found
the
mother
alone
in
her
and
she
received
them
with
an
effusiveness
very
distasteful
to
earwaker
you
should
was
her
first
exclamation
to
malkin
you
should
it
really
very
naughty
of
you
o
earwaker
who
ever
took
so
much
pleasure
in
doing
kindnesses
do
look
at
this
book
that
malkin
has
sent
as
a
present
to
my
little
bella
o
mr
earwaker
the
journalist
was
at
once
struck
with
her
tone
and
manner
as
she
addressed
malkin
he
remarked
that
phrase
little
bella
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
jacox
had
been
growing
younger
since
he
made
her
acquaintance
on
the
towers
of
notre
dame
when
the
girls
presented
themselves
they
also
appeared
to
him
more
juvenile
bella
in
particular
was
dressed
with
an
exaggeration
of
childishness
decidedly
not
becoming
one
had
but
to
look
into
her
face
to
see
that
she
answered
perfectly
to
malkin
description
she
was
a
young
lady
and
no
child
a
very
pretty
young
lady
moreover
given
to
colouring
but
with
no
silly
simper
intelligent
about
the
eyes
and
lips
modest
in
a
natural
and
sweet
way
he
conversed
with
her
and
in
doing
so
was
disagreeably
affected
by
certain
glances
she
occasionally
cast
towards
her
mother
one
would
have
said
that
she
feared
censure
though
it
was
hard
to
see
why
on
the
return
journey
earwaker
made
known
some
of
his
impressions
though
not
all
like
the
girls
he
said
especially
but
i
ca
say
much
good
of
their
mother
they
were
opposite
each
other
in
the
railway
carriage
malkin
leaned
forward
with
earnest
anxious
face
my
own
trouble
he
whispered
confoundedly
uneasy
about
it
i
do
think
she
bringing
them
up
at
all
in
a
proper
way
earwaker
i
would
pay
down
five
thousand
pounds
for
the
possibility
of
taking
bella
away
altogether
the
other
mused
mind
you
pursued
malkin
not
a
woman
by
no
means
thoroughly
i
convinced
only
a
little
weak
here
he
tapped
his
forehead
respect
her
for
all
she
has
suffered
and
her
way
of
going
through
it
but
she
is
the
ideal
mother
you
know
on
his
way
home
malkin
turned
into
his
friend
chambers
five
minutes
at
two
in
the
morning
he
was
still
there
and
his
talk
in
the
meanwhile
had
been
of
nothing
but
schemes
for
protecting
bella
against
her
mother
more
objectionable
influences
on
taking
leave
he
asked
news
of
peak
yet
i
have
seen
moxey
for
a
long
time
you
think
peak
will
look
you
up
again
if
he
in
london
i
think
he
keep
away
and
i
half
hope
he
will
i
quite
know
how
to
behave
ten
to
one
he
in
london
now
i
suppose
he
could
stay
at
exeter
but
he
may
have
left
england
they
parted
and
for
a
week
did
not
see
each
other
then
on
monday
evening
when
earwaker
was
very
busy
with
a
mass
of
manuscript
the
knock
sounded
from
the
passage
and
malkin
received
admission
the
look
he
wore
was
appalling
a
look
such
as
only
some
fearful
catastrophe
could
warrant
you
busy
he
asked
in
a
voice
very
unlike
his
own
earwaker
could
not
doubt
that
the
trouble
was
this
time
serious
he
abandoned
his
work
and
gave
himself
wholly
to
his
friend
service
awful
thing
has
happened
malkin
began
the
deuce
shall
i
tell
you
oh
the
ass
i
have
made
of
myself
but
i
could
help
it
there
seemed
no
way
out
of
it
what
was
last
night
but
i
could
come
to
you
till
now
by
jove
i
veritably
thought
of
sending
you
a
note
and
then
killing
myself
early
this
morning
i
was
within
an
ace
of
suicide
believe
me
old
friend
this
is
no
farce
waiting
yes
but
i
ca
tell
you
all
at
once
sure
you
not
busy
i
know
i
pester
you
i
was
down
at
wrotham
yesterday
i
had
meant
to
go
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong
i
got
there
at
five
and
found
that
the
girls
were
gone
to
have
tea
with
some
young
friends
well
i
was
altogether
sorry
it
was
a
good
opportunity
for
a
little
talk
with
their
mother
and
i
the
talk
but
oh
ass
that
i
was
he
smote
the
side
of
his
head
savagely
you
guess
earwaker
can
you
give
a
shot
at
what
happened
i
might
replied
the
other
gravely
woman
asked
you
to
marry
her
malkin
leapt
from
his
chair
and
sank
back
again
came
to
that
yes
upon
my
word
it
came
to
that
she
said
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
me
that
was
the
long
and
short
of
it
and
i
had
never
said
a
word
that
could
suggest
oh
confound
it
what
a
frightful
scene
it
was
took
a
final
leave
of
her
malkin
stared
with
eyes
of
anguish
into
his
friend
face
and
at
length
whispered
thickly
said
i
would
take
leave
her
earwaker
had
much
ado
to
check
an
impatiently
remonstrant
laugh
he
paused
awhile
then
began
his
expostulation
at
first
treating
the
affair
as
too
absurd
for
grave
argument
boy
he
concluded
have
got
into
a
preposterous
scrape
and
i
see
only
one
way
out
of
it
you
must
flee
when
does
your
brother
start
for
the
antipodes
morning
you
go
with
him
there
an
end
of
it
malkin
listened
with
the
blank
despairing
look
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
you
hear
me
urged
the
other
home
and
pack
on
thursday
see
you
off
ca
bring
myself
to
that
came
in
a
groan
from
malkin
never
yet
done
anything
to
be
seriously
ashamed
of
and
i
ca
run
away
after
promising
marriage
it
would
weigh
upon
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
would
it
weigh
upon
you
less
to
marry
the
mother
and
all
the
time
be
in
love
with
the
daughter
to
my
mind
there
something
peculiarly
loathsome
in
the
suggestion
look
here
bella
is
very
young
really
very
young
indeed
possible
that
i
have
deluded
myself
perhaps
i
do
really
care
for
her
in
the
way
i
imagined
it
more
than
likely
that
i
might
be
content
to
regard
her
with
fatherly
affection
supposing
that
with
what
sort
of
affection
do
you
regard
mrs
jacox
malkin
writhed
on
his
chair
before
replying
must
misjudge
her
he
exclaimed
is
no
heartless
schemer
the
poor
thing
almost
cried
her
eyes
out
it
was
a
frightful
scene
she
reproached
herself
bitterly
what
i
do
i
have
a
tenderness
for
her
there
no
denying
that
she
has
been
so
vilely
used
and
has
borne
it
all
so
patiently
how
abominable
it
would
be
if
i
dealt
her
another
blow
the
journalist
raised
his
eyebrows
and
uttered
inarticulate
sounds
anything
said
about
bella
he
asked
abruptly
a
word
i
convinced
she
does
suspect
that
i
thought
of
bella
like
that
the
fact
is
i
have
misled
her
she
thought
all
along
that
my
chief
interest
was
in
then
what
was
the
ground
of
her
that
you
speak
of
defective
you
are
in
the
appreciation
of
delicate
feeling
cried
malkin
frantically
starting
up
and
rushing
about
the
room
reproached
herself
for
having
permitted
me
to
get
entangled
with
a
widow
older
than
myself
and
the
mother
of
two
children
what
could
be
simpler
earwaker
began
to
appreciate
the
dangers
of
the
situation
if
he
insisted
upon
his
view
of
jacox
behaviour
though
it
was
not
the
harshest
that
the
circumstances
suggested
for
he
was
disposed
to
believe
that
the
widow
had
really
lost
her
heart
to
her
kind
eccentric
champion
the
result
would
probably
be
to
confirm
malkin
in
his
resolution
of
the
man
must
be
saved
if
possible
from
such
calamity
and
this
would
not
be
effected
by
merely
demonstrating
that
he
was
on
the
highroad
to
ruin
it
was
necessary
to
try
another
tack
seems
to
me
malkin
he
resumed
gravely
it
is
you
who
are
deficient
in
right
feeling
in
offering
to
marry
this
poor
woman
you
did
her
the
gravest
wrong
how
know
that
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
love
her
you
know
that
you
will
repent
and
that
she
will
be
aware
of
it
you
are
not
the
kind
of
man
to
conceal
your
emotions
bella
will
grow
up
and
well
the
state
of
things
wo
tend
to
domestic
felicity
for
mrs
jacox
own
sake
it
is
your
duty
to
put
an
end
to
this
folly
before
it
has
gone
too
far
the
other
gave
earnest
ear
but
with
no
sign
of
shaken
conviction
he
said
know
this
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it
but
it
assumes
that
a
man
ca
control
himself
that
his
sense
of
honour
is
strong
enough
to
keep
him
in
the
right
way
i
do
think
you
quite
understand
me
i
am
not
a
passionate
man
the
proof
is
that
i
have
never
fallen
in
love
since
i
was
sixteen
i
think
a
great
deal
of
domestic
peace
a
good
deal
more
than
of
romantic
enthusiasm
if
i
marry
jacox
i
shall
make
her
a
good
and
faithful
husband
so
much
i
can
safely
say
of
myself
he
waited
but
earwaker
was
not
ready
with
a
rejoinder
there
another
point
i
have
always
admitted
the
defect
of
my
character
an
inability
to
settle
down
now
if
i
run
away
to
new
zealand
with
the
sense
of
having
dishonoured
myself
i
shall
be
a
mere
wandering
jew
for
the
rest
of
my
life
all
hope
of
redemption
will
be
over
of
the
two
courses
now
open
to
me
that
of
marriage
with
jacox
is
decidedly
the
less
disadvantageous
granting
that
i
have
made
a
fool
of
myself
i
must
abide
by
the
result
and
make
the
best
of
it
and
the
plain
fact
is
i
treat
her
so
disgracefully
i
burden
my
conscience
in
this
way
i
believe
it
would
end
in
suicide
i
do
indeed
sounds
all
very
well
but
it
is
weakness
and
selfishness
can
you
say
so
no
proving
to
so
a
man
the
result
of
his
mistaken
course
i
a
good
mind
to
let
you
have
your
way
just
for
the
satisfaction
of
saying
afterwards
did
i
tell
you
so
you
propose
to
behave
with
abominable
injustice
to
two
people
putting
yourself
aside
does
it
occur
to
you
that
bella
may
already
look
upon
you
as
her
future
husband
have
you
done
your
best
to
plant
that
idea
in
her
mind
malkin
started
but
quickly
recovered
himself
i
have
i
have
behaved
with
the
utmost
discretion
bella
thinks
of
me
only
as
of
a
friend
much
older
than
herself
do
believe
it
earwaker
a
child
of
fifteen
other
day
you
had
quite
a
different
view
and
after
seeing
her
again
i
agreed
with
you
she
is
a
young
girl
and
if
not
already
in
love
with
you
is
on
the
way
to
be
so
will
come
to
nothing
when
she
hears
that
i
am
going
to
be
her
more
likely
to
develop
into
a
grief
that
will
waste
the
best
part
of
her
lifetime
she
will
be
shocked
and
made
miserable
but
do
as
you
like
i
am
tired
of
arguing
earwaker
affected
to
abandon
the
matter
in
disgust
for
several
minutes
there
was
silence
then
a
low
voice
sounded
from
the
corner
where
malkin
stood
leaning
it
is
your
honest
belief
that
bella
has
begun
to
think
of
me
in
that
way
am
convinced
of
it
if
i
run
away
i
shall
never
see
her
again
not
wo
run
away
come
back
when
things
have
squared
themselves
write
to
jacox
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
let
her
understand
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
your
marrying
her
her
about
bella
you
mean
that
just
what
i
do
mean
avoid
any
mention
of
the
girl
come
back
when
she
is
seventeen
and
if
she
is
willing
carry
her
off
to
be
happy
ever
after
she
may
have
fallen
in
love
with
someone
else
think
not
you
must
risk
it
at
all
events
here
malkin
came
forward
eagerly
write
to
jacox
and
make
a
full
confession
i
tell
her
exactly
how
the
case
stands
she
a
good
woman
she
gladly
sacrifice
herself
for
the
sake
of
her
daughter
earwaker
was
firm
in
resistance
he
had
no
faith
whatever
in
the
widow
capacity
for
and
foresaw
that
his
friend
would
be
drawn
into
another
scene
resulting
probably
in
a
marriage
as
soon
as
the
licence
could
be
obtained
are
you
to
see
her
again
he
inquired
wednesday
you
undertake
to
do
nothing
whatever
till
wednesday
morning
and
then
to
have
another
talk
with
me
i
come
and
see
you
about
ten
in
the
end
malkin
was
constrained
into
making
this
engagement
and
not
long
after
midnight
the
journalist
managed
to
get
rid
of
him
on
tuesday
afternoon
arrived
a
distracted
note
shall
keep
my
promise
and
i
wo
try
to
see
you
till
you
come
here
tomorrow
but
i
am
sore
beset
i
have
received
letters
from
jacox
all
long
and
horribly
pathetic
she
seems
to
have
a
presentiment
that
i
shall
forsake
her
what
a
beast
i
shall
be
if
i
do
tom
comes
here
and
i
think
i
shall
tell
him
all
the
last
sentence
was
a
relief
to
the
reader
he
knew
nothing
of
mr
thomas
malkin
but
there
was
a
fair
presumption
that
this
gentleman
would
not
see
his
brother
bent
on
making
such
a
notable
fool
of
himself
without
vigorous
protest
at
the
appointed
hour
next
morning
earwaker
reached
his
lodgings
which
were
now
at
kilburn
on
entering
the
room
he
saw
not
the
familiar
figure
but
a
solid
man
whom
a
faint
resemblance
enabled
him
to
identify
as
malkin
the
younger
was
expecting
you
said
thomas
as
they
shook
hands
brother
is
completely
floored
when
i
got
here
an
hour
ago
i
insisted
on
his
lying
down
and
now
i
think
he
asleep
if
you
do
mind
we
let
him
rest
for
a
little
i
believe
he
has
hardly
closed
his
eyes
since
this
unfortunate
affair
happened
rejoiced
me
to
hear
that
he
was
going
to
ask
your
advice
how
do
matters
stand
know
mrs
jacox
thomas
was
obviously
a
man
of
discretion
but
less
intellectual
than
his
brother
he
spoke
like
one
who
is
accustomed
to
the
management
of
affairs
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
a
polite
reserve
but
conversation
speedily
put
him
more
at
ease
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
he
said
presently
we
must
take
him
away
with
us
the
voyage
will
bring
him
to
his
senses
course
he
resists
but
if
you
will
give
me
your
help
i
think
we
can
manage
him
he
is
not
very
in
a
spasmodic
way
he
can
defy
everyone
but
the
steady
pressure
of
common
sense
will
prevail
with
him
i
think
they
had
talked
for
when
the
door
opened
and
the
object
of
their
benevolent
cares
stood
before
them
he
was
clad
in
a
and
his
disordered
hair
heightened
the
look
of
illness
which
his
features
presented
did
you
call
me
he
asked
his
brother
irritably
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
not
very
well
i
overslept
myself
yes
come
and
sit
down
thomas
made
an
offer
to
leave
them
go
said
malkin
need
whatever
you
know
why
earwaker
has
been
so
kind
as
to
come
here
we
may
as
well
talk
it
over
together
he
sat
on
the
table
swinging
a
tassel
of
his
round
and
round
what
do
you
really
think
of
doing
asked
the
journalist
in
a
kind
voice
do
know
i
absolutely
do
not
know
i
unutterably
wretched
that
case
will
you
let
your
brother
and
me
decide
for
you
we
have
no
desire
but
for
your
good
and
we
are
perfectly
at
one
in
our
judgment
course
i
know
what
you
will
propose
cried
the
other
excitedly
the
prudential
point
of
view
you
are
right
i
have
no
doubt
but
how
can
you
protect
me
against
remorse
if
you
had
received
letters
such
as
these
three
he
pulled
them
out
of
a
pocket
would
be
as
miserable
as
i
am
if
i
do
keep
my
promise
i
shall
never
know
another
moment
of
peace
certainly
wo
if
you
keep
it
remarked
thomas
added
earwaker
one
if
not
two
other
persons
will
be
put
into
the
same
case
whereas
by
boldly
facing
these
reproaches
of
conscience
you
do
a
great
kindness
to
the
others
only
you
could
assure
me
of
that
assure
you
that
is
to
say
i
can
give
it
as
my
unassailable
conviction
and
earwaker
once
more
enlarged
upon
the
theme
stating
it
from
every
point
of
view
that
served
his
purpose
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
was
the
confirmatory
remark
that
came
from
thomas
respectable
lady
will
get
over
her
sorrows
quickly
enough
and
some
day
she
be
only
too
glad
to
have
you
for
a
if
miss
bella
still
pleases
you
only
right
urged
earwaker
in
pursuance
of
his
subtler
intention
you
should
bear
the
worst
of
the
suffering
for
the
trouble
has
come
out
of
your
own
thoughtlessness
you
are
fond
of
saying
that
you
have
behaved
with
the
utmost
discretion
so
far
from
that
you
have
been
outrageously
indiscreet
i
foresaw
that
something
of
this
kind
might
come
to
pass
why
the
devil
did
you
warn
me
shouted
malkin
in
an
agony
of
nervous
strain
would
have
been
useless
in
fact
i
foresaw
it
too
late
the
discussion
continued
for
an
hour
by
careful
insistence
on
the
idea
of
earwaker
by
degrees
demolished
the
arguments
his
friend
kept
putting
forward
thomas
who
had
gone
impatiently
to
the
window
turned
round
with
words
that
were
meant
to
be
final
quite
decided
you
begin
your
preparations
at
once
and
morning
you
go
on
board
with
us
if
i
do
go
to
wrotham
this
afternoon
she
be
here
either
or
the
first
thing
i
sure
of
it
four
or
five
said
earwaker
can
have
broken
up
the
camp
you
often
done
it
at
shorter
notice
go
to
an
hotel
for
the
night
must
write
to
the
poor
woman
as
you
like
about
that
is
to
help
her
if
she
gets
into
difficulties
as
she
always
doing
who
is
to
advise
her
about
bella
education
who
is
to
pay
i
mean
who
will
see
to
oh
confound
it
the
listeners
glanced
at
each
other
her
affairs
in
order
asked
earwaker
she
a
sufficient
income
ordinary
needs
quite
sufficient
but
you
need
be
in
the
least
uneasy
let
her
know
where
you
are
when
the
equator
is
between
you
watch
over
her
interests
from
a
distance
if
you
like
i
can
as
good
as
promise
you
that
bella
will
wait
hopefully
to
see
her
friend
again
malkin
succumbed
to
argument
and
exhaustion
facing
earwaker
with
a
look
of
pathetic
appeal
he
asked
hoarsely
you
stand
by
me
till

the

man
and
his
faithful
friend

next
morning
earwaker
went
down
to

and
said
farewell
to
the

orient
thomas
had
already
taken

under
her
special
care
only
three

to

she
remarked
in
a
laughing
aside
to
the
journalist
grateful
he
will
be
to
you
in
a
few
days
and
i
sure
are
already
malkin
eyes
were
no
longer
quite
lustreless
at
the
last
moment
he
talked
with
animation
of
years
hence
and
there
was
vigour
in
the
waving
of
his
hand
as
the
vessel
started
seaward
chapter
iii
peak
lost
no
time
in
leaving
exeter
to
lighten
his
baggage
and
to
get
rid
of
possessions
to
which
hateful
memories
attached
he
sold
all
his
books
that
had
any
bearing
on
theology
the
incomplete
translation
of
und
he
committed
to
the
flames
in
mrs
roots
kitchen
scattering
its
black
remnants
with
savage
thrusts
of
the
poker
whilst
engaged
in
packing
he
debated
with
himself
whether
or
not
he
should
take
leave
of
the
few
acquaintances
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
hospitality
and
other
kindness
the
question
was
had
buckland
warricombe
already
warned
these
people
against
him
probably
it
had
seemed
to
buckland
the
wiser
course
to
be
content
with
driving
the
hypocrite
away
and
if
this
were
so
regard
for
the
future
dictated
a
retirement
from
exeter
which
should
in
no
way
resemble
secret
flight
sidwell
influence
with
her
parents
would
perhaps
withhold
them
from
making
his
disgrace
known
and
in
a
few
years
he
might
be
glad
that
he
had
behaved
with
all
possible
prudence
in
the
end
he
decided
to
write
to
lilywhite
saying
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
away
at
a
notice
and
that
he
feared
it
would
be
necessary
altogether
to
change
the
scheme
of
life
which
he
had
had
in
view
this
was
the
best
way
from
the
lilywhites
other
people
would
hear
of
him
and
perchance
their
conjectures
would
be
charitable
without
much
hesitation
he
had
settled
his
immediate
plans
to
london
he
would
not
return
for
he
dreaded
the
temptations
to
which
the
proximity
of
sidwell
would
expose
him
and
he
had
no
mind
to
meet
with
moxey
or
earwaker
as
it
was
now
imperative
that
he
should
find
work
of
the
old
kind
he
could
not
do
better
than
go
to
bristol
where
from
the
safe
ground
of
a
cheap
and
obscure
lodging
he
might
make
inquiries
watch
advertisements
and
so
on
he
already
knew
of
establishments
in
bristol
where
he
might
possibly
obtain
employment
living
with
the
utmost
economy
he
need
not
fall
into
difficulties
for
more
than
a
year
and
before
then
his
good
repute
with
the
rotherhithe
firm
would
ensure
him
some
position
or
other
if
not
in
bristol
then
at
newcastle
helen
any
great
centre
of
fuming
and
malodorous
industry
he
was
ready
to
work
would
delight
in
work
idleness
was
now
the
intolerable
thing
so
to
bristol
he
betook
himself
and
there
made
his
temporary
abode
after
spending
a
few
weeks
in
fruitless
search
for
an
engagement
he
at
length
paid
his
visit
to
twybridge
in
the
old
home
he
felt
completely
a
stranger
and
his
relatives
strengthened
the
feeling
by
declaring
him
so
changed
in
appearance
that
they
hardly
knew
his
face
with
his
mother
only
could
he
talk
in
anything
like
an
intimate
way
and
the
falsehoods
with
which
he
was
obliged
to
answer
her
questions
all
but
destroyed
the
pleasure
he
would
otherwise
have
found
in
being
affectionately
tended
his
sister
mrs
cusse
was
happy
in
her
husband
her
children
and
a
flourishing
business
oliver
was
making
money
and
enjoyed
distinction
among
the
shopkeeping
community
his
aunt
still
dealt
in
millinery
and
kept
up
her
acquaintance
with
respectable
families
to
godwin
all
was
like
a
dream
dreamt
for
the
second
time
he
could
not
acknowledge
any
actual
connection
between
these
people
and
himself
but
their
characteristics
no
longer
gravely
offended
him
and
he
willingly
recognised
the
homespun
worth
which
their
lives
displayed
it
was
clear
to
him
that
by
no
possible
agency
of
circumstances
could
he
have
been
held
in
normal
relations
with
his
kinsfolk
however
smooth
his
career
it
must
have
wafted
him
to
an
immeasurable
distance
from
twybridge
nature
had
decreed
that
he
was
to
resemble
the
animals
which
once
reared
go
forth
in
complete
independence
of
birthplace
and
the
ties
of
blood
it
was
a
harsh
fate
but
in
what
had
not
fate
been
harsh
to
him
the
one
consolation
was
that
he
alone
suffered
his
mother
was
no
doubt
occasionally
troubled
by
solicitude
on
his
account
but
she
could
not
divine
his
inward
miseries
and
an
assurance
that
he
had
no
material
cares
sufficed
to
set
her
mind
at
ease
are
very
like
your
father
godwin
she
said
with
a
sigh
could
rest
however
well
he
seemed
to
be
getting
on
there
was
always
something
he
wanted
and
yet
he
did
know
what
it
was
i
must
be
like
him
godwin
replied
smiling
he
stayed
five
days
then
returned
to
bristol
a
week
after
that
his
mother
forwarded
to
him
a
letter
which
had
come
to
twybridge
he
at
once
recognised
the
writing
and
broke
the
envelope
with
curiosity
you
should
be
in
london
the
note
began
i
beg
you
to
let
me
see
you
there
is
something
i
have
to
say
to
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
i
would
come
any
distance
do
accuse
me
of
behaving
treacherously
it
was
not
my
fault
i
know
you
would
rather
avoid
me
but
do
consent
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
if
you
have
no
intention
of
coming
to
london
will
you
write
and
let
me
know
where
you
are
living
what
could
marcella
have
to
say
to
him
nothing
surely
that
he
at
all
cared
to
hear
no
doubt
she
imagined
that
he
might
be
in
ignorance
of
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
buckland
warricombe
discovery
she
wished
to
defend
herself
against
the
suspicion
of
he
laughed
carelessly
and
threw
her
note
aside
two
months
passed
and
his
efforts
to
find
employment
were
still
vain
though
he
had
received
conditional
promises
the
solitude
of
his
life
grew
burdensome
several
times
he
began
a
letter
to
sidwell
but
his
difficulty
in
writing
was
so
great
that
he
destroyed
the
attempt
in
truth
he
knew
not
how
to
address
her
the
words
he
penned
were
tumid
meaningless
he
could
not
send
professions
of
love
for
his
heart
seemed
to
be
suffering
a
paralysis
and
the
laborious
artificiality
of
his
style
must
have
been
evident
the
only
excuse
for
breaking
silence
would
be
to
let
her
know
that
he
had
resumed
honest
work
he
must
wait
till
the
opportunity
offered
it
did
not
distress
him
to
be
without
news
of
her
if
she
wished
to
write
and
was
only
withheld
by
ignorance
of
his
whereabouts
it
was
well
if
she
had
no
thought
of
sending
him
a
word
it
did
not
matter
he
loved
her
and
consciously
nourished
hope
but
for
the
present
there
was
nothing
intolerable
in
separation
his
state
of
mind
resulted
partly
from
nervous
reaction
and
in
part
from
a
sense
that
only
by
silent
suffering
could
his
dignity
in
sidwell
eyes
be
ultimately
restored
between
the
evil
past
and
the
hopeful
future
must
be
a
complete
break
his
thoughts
kept
turning
to
london
though
not
because
sidwell
might
still
be
there
he
felt
urgent
need
of
speaking
with
a
friend
moxey
was
perhaps
no
longer
to
be
considered
one
but
earwaker
would
be
tolerant
of
human
weaknesses
to
have
a
long
talk
with
earwaker
would
help
him
to
recover
his
mental
balance
to
understand
himself
and
his
position
better
so
one
morning
in
march
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
took
train
and
was
once
more
in
the
metropolis
on
his
way
he
had
determined
to
send
a
note
to
earwaker
before
calling
at
staple
inn
he
wrote
it
at
a
small
hotel
in
paddington
where
he
took
a
room
for
the
night
and
then
spent
the
evening
at
a
theatre
as
the
best
way
of
killing
time
by
the
first
post
next
morning
came
a
card
whereon
earwaker
had
written
here
if
you
can
at
two
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
you
have
been
godwin
remarked
as
he
was
admitted
to
the
chambers
look
much
more
comfortable
glad
you
think
so
it
is
the
general
opinion
they
had
shaken
hands
as
though
this
were
one
of
the
ordinary
meetings
of
old
time
and
their
voices
scarcely
belied
the
appearance
peak
moved
about
the
study
glancing
at
pictures
and
books
earwaker
eyeing
him
the
while
with
not
unfriendly
expression
they
were
sincerely
glad
to
see
each
other
and
when
peak
seated
himself
it
was
with
an
audible
sigh
of
contentment
what
are
you
doing
he
inquired
the
journalist
gave
a
brief
account
of
his
affairs
and
peak
brightened
with
pleasure
is
good
news
i
knew
you
would
shake
off
the
ragamuffins
before
long
give
me
some
of
your
back
numbers
will
you
i
shall
be
curious
to
examine
your
new
style
you
come
to
live
in
london
i
am
at
bristol
but
only
waiting
there
a
chance
of
an
analyst
place
in
lancashire
but
i
may
give
the
preference
to
an
opening
i
have
heard
of
in
belgium
better
to
go
abroad
i
think
so
have
a
question
to
ask
you
i
suppose
you
talked
about
that
article
of
mine
you
received
my
request
for
silence
how
it
was
earwaker
replied
calmly
i
understood
it
does
matter
the
other
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
moved
uneasily
am
taking
for
granted
peak
continued
you
know
how
i
have
spent
my
time
down
in
devonshire
outline
need
we
trouble
about
the
details
but
do
suppose
that
i
should
feel
any
shame
in
talking
to
you
about
them
that
would
be
a
confession
of
base
motive
you
and
i
have
studied
each
other
and
we
can
exchange
thoughts
on
most
subjects
with
mutual
understanding
you
know
that
i
have
only
followed
my
convictions
to
their
logical
issue
an
opportunity
offered
of
achieving
the
supreme
end
to
which
my
life
is
directed
and
what
scruple
could
stand
in
my
way
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
names
and
epithets
are
the
facts
of
life
as
i
had
known
it
is
the
existence
promised
as
the
reward
of
successful
artifice
to
live
was
to
pursue
the
object
of
my
being
i
could
not
feel
otherwise
therefore
could
not
act
otherwise
you
imagine
me
defeated
flung
back
into
the
gutter
his
words
came
more
quickly
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
worked
under
emotion
is
so
i
have
a
great
and
reasonable
hope
perhaps
i
have
gained
everything
i
really
desired
i
could
tell
you
the
strangest
story
but
there
a
scruple
interpose
if
we
live
another
twenty
years
but
now
i
can
only
talk
about
myself
this
hope
of
which
you
speak
said
earwaker
with
a
grave
smile
you
at
present
to
sober
work
among
your
retorts
and
it
does
then
i
can
put
faith
in
the
result
the
hope
began
in
a
lie
rejoined
peak
bitterly
will
always
be
pleasant
to
look
back
upon
that
wo
it
you
see
by
no
conceivable
honest
effort
could
i
have
gained
this
point
life
utterly
denied
to
me
the
satisfaction
of
my
strongest
instincts
so
long
as
i
plodded
on
without
cause
of
shame
the
moment
i
denied
my
faith
and
put
on
a
visage
of
brass
great
possibilities
opened
before
me
of
course
i
understand
the
moralist
position
it
behoved
me
though
i
knew
that
a
barren
and
solitary
track
would
be
my
only
treading
to
the
end
to
keep
courageously
onward
if
i
ca
that
any
such
duty
is
imposed
upon
me
where
is
the
obligation
to
persevere
the
morality
of
doing
so
that
is
the
worst
hypocrisy
i
have
been
honest
inasmuch
as
i
have
acted
in
accordance
with
my
actual
belief
m
m
muttered
earwaker
slowly
you
have
never
been
troubled
with
a
twinge
of
conscience
a
thousand
i
have
been
racked
martyred
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
do
you
suppose
i
attach
any
final
significance
to
those
torments
conscience
is
the
same
in
my
view
as
an
inherited
disease
which
may
possibly
break
out
on
any
most
innocent
physical
what
end
have
i
been
pursuing
is
it
criminal
is
it
mean
i
wanted
to
win
the
love
of
a
woman
nothing
more
to
do
that
i
have
had
to
behave
like
the
grovelling
villain
who
has
no
desire
but
to
fill
his
pockets
and
with
success
you
understand
that
earwaker
i
have
succeeded
what
respect
can
i
have
for
the
common
morality
after
this
have
succeeded
the
other
asked
thoughtfully
could
have
imagined
that
you
had
been
in
appearance
successful
he
paused
and
peak
resumed
with
vehemence
not
in
appearance
only
i
ca
tell
you
the
story
do
wish
you
to
what
i
have
won
is
won
for
ever
the
triumph
no
longer
rests
on
deceit
what
i
insist
upon
is
that
by
deceit
only
was
it
rendered
possible
if
a
starving
man
succeeds
in
stealing
a
loaf
of
bread
the
food
will
benefit
him
no
less
than
if
he
had
purchased
it
it
is
good
true
sustenance
no
matter
how
he
got
it
to
be
sure
the
man
may
prefer
starvation
he
may
have
so
strong
a
metaphysical
faith
that
death
is
welcome
in
comparison
with
what
he
calls
dishonour
i
i
have
no
such
faith
and
millions
of
other
men
in
this
country
would
tell
the
blunt
truth
if
they
said
the
same
i
have
that
all
the
old
way
of
candour
led
me
to
bitterness
and
cursing
by
dissimulation
i
have
won
something
more
glorious
than
tongue
can
tell
it
was
in
the
endeavour
to
expel
the
subtlest
enemy
of
his
peace
that
godwin
dwelt
so
defiantly
upon
this
view
of
the
temptation
to
which
he
had
yielded
since
his
farewell
interview
with
sidwell
he
knew
no
rest
from
the
torment
of
a
mocking
voice
which
bade
him
bear
in
mind
that
all
his
dishonour
had
been
superfluous
seeing
that
whilst
he
played
the
part
of
a
zealous
christian
sidwell
herself
was
drifting
further
and
further
from
the
old
religion
this
voice
mingled
with
his
dreams
and
left
not
a
waking
hour
untroubled
he
refused
to
believe
it
strove
against
the
suggestion
as
a
man
does
against
the
persistent
thought
of
suicide
if
only
he
could
obtain
assent
to
the
plan
he
put
forward
it
would
support
him
in
disregard
of
idle
regrets
is
impossible
said
the
journalist
anyone
to
determine
whether
that
is
true
or
not
for
you
as
much
as
for
anyone
else
be
glad
that
you
have
shaken
off
the
evil
and
retained
the
good
no
use
in
saying
more
than
that
declared
the
other
stubbornly
is
good
in
exposing
false
views
of
life
i
ought
to
have
come
utterly
to
grief
and
shame
and
instead
well
i
have
told
you
i
interpret
thus
that
you
have
permission
to
redeem
your
character
if
possible
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
you
have
grievously
misled
godwin
frowned
suggested
this
to
you
earwaker
no
one
else
i
do
even
know
who
the
woman
is
of
whom
you
speak
you
are
right
as
an
honest
man
i
should
never
have
won
her
faintest
interest
is
absurd
for
us
to
talk
about
it
think
in
the
way
that
is
most
helpful
to
you
that
no
doubt
is
a
reasonable
rule
let
us
have
done
with
all
these
obscurities
and
come
to
a
practical
question
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
would
you
care
for
instance
to
write
an
article
now
and
then
on
some
scientific
matter
that
has
a
popular
interest
i
think
i
could
promise
to
get
that
kind
of
thing
printed
for
you
or
would
you
review
an
occasional
book
that
happened
to
be
in
your
line
godwin
reflected
you
he
replied
at
length
should
be
glad
of
such
work
if
i
can
get
into
the
mood
for
doing
it
properly
that
wo
be
just
yet
but
perhaps
when
i
have
found
a
place
it
over
write
to
me
about
it
peak
glanced
round
the
room
do
know
how
glad
i
am
he
said
your
prosperity
shows
itself
in
this
region
of
bachelordom
if
i
had
seen
you
in
a
comfortable
house
married
to
a
woman
worthy
of
you
i
could
have
been
sincere
in
my
congratulations
i
should
have
envied
you
so
fiercely
a
strange
fellow
twenty
years
hence
as
you
said
just
now
you
will
one
way
or
another
have
got
rid
of
your
astounding
illusions
at
fifty
well
let
us
say
at
sixty
you
will
have
a
chance
of
seeing
things
without
these
preposterous
sexual
spectacles
hope
so
every
stage
of
life
has
its
powers
and
enjoyments
when
i
am
old
i
hope
to
perceive
and
judge
without
passion
of
any
kind
but
is
that
any
reason
why
my
youth
should
be
frustrated
we
have
only
one
life
and
i
want
to
live
mine
throughout
soon
after
this
peak
rose
he
remembered
that
the
journalist
time
was
valuable
and
that
he
no
longer
had
the
right
to
demand
more
of
it
than
could
be
granted
to
any
casual
caller
earwaker
behaved
with
all
friendliness
but
their
relations
had
necessarily
suffered
a
change
more
than
a
year
of
separation
spent
by
the
one
in
accumulating
memories
of
dishonour
had
given
the
other
an
enviable
position
among
men
earwaker
had
his
place
in
the
social
system
his
growing
circle
of
friends
his
congenial
labour
perhaps
notwithstanding
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
of
marriage
his
hopes
of
domestic
happiness
all
this
with
no
sacrifice
of
principle
he
was
fortunate
in
his
temper
moral
and
intellectual
partly
directing
circumstances
partly
guided
by
their
pressure
he
advanced
on
the
way
of
harmonious
development
nothing
great
would
come
of
his
endeavours
but
what
he
aimed
at
he
steadily
perfected
and
this
in
spite
of
the
adverse
conditions
under
which
he
began
his
course
nature
had
been
kind
to
him
what
more
could
one
say
when
he
went
forth
into
the
street
again
godwin
felt
his
heart
sink
his
solitude
was
the
more
complete
for
this
hour
of
friendly
dialogue
no
other
companionship
offered
itself
if
he
lingered
here
it
must
be
as
one
of
the
drifting
crowd
as
an
idle
and
envious
spectator
of
the
business
and
pleasure
rife
about
him
he
durst
not
approach
that
quarter
of
the
town
where
sidwell
was
living
if
indeed
she
still
remained
here
happily
the
vastness
of
london
enabled
him
to
think
of
her
as
at
a
great
distance
by
keeping
to
the
district
in
which
he
now
wandered
he
was
practically
as
remote
from
her
as
when
he
walked
the
streets
of
bristol
yet
there
was
one
person
who
would
welcome
him
eagerly
if
he
chose
to
visit
her
and
after
all
might
it
not
be
as
well
if
he
heard
what
marcella
had
to
say
to
him
he
could
not
go
to
the
house
for
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
encounter
moxey
but
if
he
wrote
marcella
would
speedily
make
an
appointment
after
an
hour
or
two
of
purposeless
rambling
he
decided
to
ask
for
an
interview
he
might
learn
something
that
really
concerned
him
in
any
case
it
was
a
final
meeting
with
marcella
to
whom
he
perhaps
owed
this
much
courtesy
the
reply
was
as
prompt
as
that
from
earwaker
by
the
morning
post
came
a
letter
inviting
him
to
call
upon
miss
moxey
as
soon
as
possible
before
noon
she
added
brother
is
away
in
the
country
you
will
meet
no
one
here
by
eleven
he
was
at
notting
hill
in
the
he
sat
alone
for
two
or
three
minutes
marcella
entered
silently
and
came
towards
him
without
a
smile
he
saw
that
she
read
his
face
eagerly
if
not
with
a
light
of
triumph
in
her
eyes
the
expression
might
signify
that
she
rejoiced
at
having
been
an
instrument
of
his
discomfiture
perhaps
it
was
nothing
more
than
gladness
at
seeing
him
again
you
come
to
live
in
london
she
asked
when
they
had
shaken
hands
without
a
word
am
only
here
for
a
day
or
two
letter
reached
you
without
delay
it
was
sent
from
twybridge
to
bristol
i
did
reply
then
as
i
had
no
prospect
of
being
in
london
you
sit
down
you
can
stay
for
a
few
minutes
he
seated
himself
awkwardly
now
that
he
was
in
marcella
presence
he
felt
that
he
had
acted
unaccountably
in
giving
occasion
for
another
scene
between
them
which
could
only
end
as
painfully
as
that
at
exeter
her
emotion
grew
evident
he
could
not
bear
to
meet
the
look
she
had
fixed
upon
him
want
to
speak
of
what
happened
in
this
house
about
christmas
time
she
resumed
i
must
know
first
what
you
have
been
told
have
been
told
he
replied
with
an
uneasy
smile
do
you
know
that
anything
which
happened
here
had
any
importance
for
me
do
know
that
it
had
but
i
felt
sure
that
warricombe
meant
to
speak
to
you
about
it
he
did
did
he
tell
you
the
exact
truth
or
were
you
led
to
suppose
that
i
had
broken
my
promise
to
you
unwilling
to
introduce
any
mention
of
sidwell
peak
preferred
to
simplify
the
story
by
attributing
to
buckland
all
the
information
he
had
gathered
understood
he
replied
warricombe
had
come
here
in
the
hope
of
learning
more
about
me
and
that
certain
facts
came
out
in
general
conversation
what
does
it
matter
how
he
learned
what
he
did
from
the
day
when
he
met
you
down
in
devonshire
it
was
of
course
inevitable
that
the
truth
should
sooner
or
later
come
out
he
always
suspected
me
i
want
you
to
know
said
marcella
i
had
no
willing
part
in
it
i
promised
you
not
to
speak
even
to
my
brother
and
i
should
never
have
done
so
but
that
christian
somehow
met
warricombe
and
heard
him
talk
of
you
of
course
he
came
to
me
in
astonishment
and
for
your
own
interest
i
thought
it
best
to
tell
christian
what
i
knew
when
warricombe
came
here
neither
christian
nor
i
would
have
enlightened
him
about
about
your
past
it
happened
most
unfortunately
that
malkin
was
present
and
he
it
was
who
began
to
speak
of
the
article
and
other
things
i
was
powerless
to
prevent
it
trouble
about
it
i
quite
believe
your
account
believe
it
you
know
i
would
not
have
injured
you
am
sure
you
had
no
wish
to
godwin
replied
in
as
unsentimental
a
tone
as
possible
and
he
added
after
a
moment
pause
this
what
you
were
so
anxious
to
tell
me
chiefly
that
me
put
your
mind
at
rest
pursued
the
other
with
quiet
friendliness
am
disposed
to
turn
optimist
everything
has
happened
just
as
it
should
have
done
warricombe
relieved
me
from
a
false
position
if
had
done
so
i
must
very
soon
have
done
it
for
myself
let
us
rejoice
that
things
work
together
for
such
obvious
good
a
few
more
lessons
of
this
kind
and
we
shall
acknowledge
that
the
world
is
the
best
possible
he
laughed
but
the
tense
expression
of
marcella
features
did
not
relax
say
you
are
living
in
bristol
a
time
you
abandoned
exeter
the
word
implied
something
that
marcella
could
not
utter
more
plainly
her
face
completed
the
question
the
clerical
career
as
well
he
answered
but
he
knew
that
she
sought
more
than
this
and
his
voice
again
broke
the
silence
you
have
heard
that
already
are
you
in
communication
with
miss
moorhouse
she
shook
her
head
probably
warricombe
has
told
your
brother
of
his
success
in
ridding
exeter
of
my
objectionable
presence
has
seen
him
again
nor
have
i
only
wish
to
assure
you
that
i
have
suffered
no
injury
my
experiment
was
doomed
to
failure
what
led
me
to
it
how
i
regarded
it
we
wo
discuss
i
am
as
little
prepared
to
do
so
now
as
when
we
talked
at
exeter
that
chapter
in
my
life
is
happily
over
as
soon
as
i
am
established
again
in
a
place
like
that
i
had
at
rotherhithe
i
shall
be
quite
contented
she
smiled
incredulously
how
long
can
say
i
have
lost
the
habit
of
looking
far
forward
marcella
kept
silence
so
long
that
he
concluded
she
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
him
it
was
an
opportunity
for
taking
leave
without
emotional
stress
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
go
yet
she
said
at
once
was
only
this
that
i
her
voice
was
checked
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
bristol
peak
asked
determined
to
avoid
the
trial
he
saw
approaching
is
something
more
i
wanted
to
say
she
pursued
seeming
not
to
hear
him
pretend
to
be
contented
but
i
know
that
is
impossible
you
talk
of
going
back
to
a
dull
routine
of
toil
when
what
you
most
desire
is
freedom
i
want
if
i
can
to
help
you
again
she
failed
to
command
her
voice
godwin
raised
his
eyes
and
was
astonished
at
the
transformation
she
had
suddenly
undergone
her
face
instead
of
being
colourless
and
darkly
vehement
had
changed
to
a
bright
warmth
a
smiling
radiance
such
as
would
have
become
a
happy
girl
his
look
seemed
to
give
her
courage
hear
me
patiently
we
are
such
old
friends
are
we
not
we
have
so
often
proclaimed
our
scorn
of
conventionality
and
why
should
a
conventional
fear
hinder
what
i
want
to
say
you
know
do
you
that
i
have
far
more
money
than
i
need
or
am
ever
likely
to
i
want
only
a
few
hundreds
a
year
and
i
have
more
than
a
thousand
she
spoke
more
and
more
quickly
fearful
of
being
interrupted
should
i
give
you
some
of
my
superfluity
let
me
help
you
in
this
way
money
can
do
so
much
take
some
from
me
and
use
it
as
you
will
just
as
you
will
it
is
useless
to
why
should
someone
whom
i
wish
well
benefit
by
it
godwin
was
not
so
much
surprised
as
disconcerted
he
knew
that
marcella
nature
was
of
large
mould
and
that
whether
she
acted
for
good
or
evil
its
promptings
would
be
anything
but
commonplace
the
ardour
with
which
she
pleaded
and
the
magnitude
of
the
benefaction
she
desired
to
bestow
upon
him
so
affected
his
imagination
that
for
the
moment
he
stood
as
if
doubting
what
reply
to
make
the
doubt
really
in
his
mind
was
whether
marcella
had
calculated
upon
his
weakness
and
hoped
to
draw
him
within
her
power
by
the
force
of
such
an
obligation
or
if
in
truth
she
sought
only
to
appease
her
heart
with
the
exercise
of
generosity
will
let
me
she
panted
forth
watching
him
with
brilliant
eyes
shall
be
a
secret
for
ever
between
you
and
me
it
imposes
no
debt
of
gratitude
how
i
despise
the
thought
i
give
you
what
is
worthless
to
me
except
that
it
can
do
good
but
you
can
thank
me
if
you
will
i
am
not
above
being
thanked
she
laughed
unnaturally
and
travel
at
first
as
you
wished
to
write
me
a
short
letter
every
month
every
two
months
just
that
i
may
know
you
are
enjoying
your
life
it
is
agreed
is
it
she
held
her
hand
to
him
but
peak
drew
away
his
face
averted
can
you
give
me
the
pain
of
refusing
such
an
offer
he
exclaimed
with
remonstrance
which
was
all
but
anger
know
the
thing
is
utterly
impossible
i
should
be
ridiculous
if
i
argued
about
it
for
a
moment
ca
see
that
it
is
impossible
you
must
take
my
word
for
it
but
i
have
no
right
to
speak
to
you
in
that
way
he
added
more
kindly
seeing
the
profound
humiliation
which
fell
upon
her
meant
to
come
to
my
aid
at
a
time
when
i
seemed
to
you
lonely
and
miserable
it
was
a
generous
impulse
and
i
do
indeed
thank
you
i
shall
always
remember
it
and
be
grateful
to
you
marcella
face
was
again
in
shadow
its
lineaments
hardened
to
an
expression
of
cold
stern
dignity
have
made
a
mistake
she
said
thought
you
above
common
ways
of
thinking
you
put
me
on
too
high
a
pedestal
peak
answered
trying
to
speak
humorously
of
my
faults
is
that
i
am
apt
to
mistake
my
own
position
in
the
same
way
think
yourself
ambitious
oh
if
you
knew
really
great
ambition
go
back
to
your
laboratory
and
work
for
wages
i
would
have
saved
you
from
that
the
tone
was
not
vehement
but
the
words
bit
all
the
deeper
for
their
unimpassioned
accent
godwin
could
make
no
reply
hope
she
continued
may
meet
a
few
years
hence
by
that
time
you
will
have
learnt
that
what
i
offered
was
not
impossible
you
will
wish
you
had
dared
to
accept
it
i
know
what
your
is
wait
till
you
are
old
enough
to
see
it
in
its
true
light
how
you
will
scorn
yourself
surely
there
was
never
a
man
who
united
such
capacity
for
great
things
with
so
mean
an
ideal
you
will
never
win
even
the
paltry
satisfaction
on
which
you
have
set
your
mind
never
but
you
ca
be
made
to
understand
that
you
will
throw
away
all
the
best
part
of
your
life
meet
me
in
a
few
years
and
tell
me
the
story
of
the
interval
will
engage
to
do
that
marcella
will
but
not
to
tell
me
the
truth
you
will
not
dare
to
tell
the
truth
not
he
asked
indifferently
i
shall
owe
it
you
in
return
for
your
frankness
till
then
she
did
not
refuse
her
hand
and
as
he
moved
away
she
watched
him
with
a
smile
of
slighting
on
the
morrow
godwin
was
back
in
bristol
and
there
he
dwelt
for
another
six
months
a
period
of
mental
and
physical
lassitude
earwaker
corresponded
with
him
and
urged
him
to
attempt
the
work
that
had
been
proposed
but
such
effort
was
beyond
his
power
he
saw
one
day
in
a
literary
paper
an
announcement
that
reusch
und
was
about
to
be
published
in
an
english
translation
so
someone
else
had
successfully
finished
the
work
he
undertook
nearly
two
years
ago
he
amused
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
could
ever
have
persevered
so
long
in
such
profitless
labour
and
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
he
muttered
just
when
the
winter
had
set
in
he
received
an
offer
of
a
post
in
chemical
works
at
helen
and
without
delay
travelled
northwards
the
appointment
was
a
poor
one
and
seemed
unlikely
to
be
a
step
to
anything
better
but
his
resources
would
not
last
more
than
another
half
year
and
employment
of
whatever
kind
came
as
welcome
relief
to
the
tedium
of
his
existence
established
in
his
new
abode
he
at
length
wrote
to
sidwell
she
answered
him
at
once
in
a
short
letter
which
he
might
have
shown
to
anyone
so
calm
were
its
expressions
of
interest
so
uncompromising
its
words
of
congratulation
it
began
mr
peak
and
ended
with
sincerely
well
he
had
used
the
same
formalities
and
had
uttered
his
feelings
with
scarcely
more
of
warmth
disappointment
troubled
him
for
a
moment
and
for
a
moment
only
he
was
so
far
from
exeter
and
further
still
from
the
life
that
he
had
led
there
it
seemed
to
him
all
but
certain
that
sidwell
wrote
coldly
with
the
intention
of
discouraging
his
hopes
what
hope
was
he
so
foolish
as
to
entertain
his
position
poorer
than
ever
what
could
justify
him
in
writing
to
a
girl
who
even
if
willing
to
marry
him
must
not
do
so
until
he
had
a
suitable
home
to
offer
her
since
his
maturity
he
had
never
known
so
long
a
freedom
from
passion
one
day
he
wrote
to
earwaker
begin
to
your
independence
with
regard
to
women
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
i
became
a
convert
to
that
way
of
thinking
but
once
or
twice
of
late
i
have
imagined
that
it
was
happening
my
mind
has
all
but
recovered
its
tone
and
i
am
able
to
read
to
think
i
mean
really
to
not
to
muse
i
get
through
big
and
solid
books
presently
if
your
offer
still
hold
good
i
shall
send
you
a
scrap
of
writing
on
something
or
other
the
pestilent
atmosphere
of
this
place
seems
to
invigorate
me
last
saturday
evening
i
took
train
got
away
into
the
hills
and
spent
the
sunday
geologising
and
a
curious
experience
befell
me
one
i
had
long
long
ago
in
the
whitelaw
days
sitting
down
before
some
interesting
strata
i
lost
myself
in
something
like
nirvana
grew
so
subject
to
the
idea
of
vastness
in
geological
time
that
all
human
desires
and
purposes
shrivelled
to
ridiculous
unimportance
awaking
for
a
minute
i
tried
to
realise
the
passion
which
not
long
ago
rent
and
racked
me
but
i
was
flatly
incapable
of
understanding
it
will
this
philosophic
state
endure
perhaps
i
have
used
up
all
my
emotional
energy
i
hardly
know
whether
to
hope
or
fear
it
about
midsummer
when
his
short
holiday
he
would
only
be
released
for
a
fortnight
drew
near
he
was
surprised
by
another
letter
from
sidwell
am
anxious
she
wrote
to
hear
that
you
are
well
it
is
more
than
half
a
year
since
your
last
letter
and
of
late
i
have
been
constantly
expecting
a
few
lines
the
spring
has
been
a
time
of
trouble
with
us
a
distant
relative
an
old
and
feeble
lady
who
has
passed
her
life
in
a
little
dorsetshire
village
came
to
see
us
in
april
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
she
was
seized
with
illness
and
died
then
fanny
had
an
attack
of
bronchitis
from
which
even
now
she
is
not
altogether
recovered
on
her
account
we
are
all
going
to
royat
and
i
think
we
shall
be
away
until
the
end
of
september
will
you
let
me
hear
from
you
before
i
leave
england
which
will
be
in
a
week
time
do
refrain
from
writing
because
you
think
you
have
no
news
to
send
anything
that
interests
you
is
of
interest
to
me
if
it
is
only
to
tell
me
what
you
have
been
reading
i
shall
be
glad
of
a
letter
it
was
still
sincerely
but
godwin
felt
that
the
letter
meant
more
in
it
he
was
pleasantly
thrilled
with
a
stirring
of
the
old
emotions
but
his
first
impulse
to
write
an
ardent
reply
did
not
carry
him
away
he
reflected
and
took
counsel
of
the
experience
gained
in
his
studious
solitude
it
was
evident
that
by
keeping
silence
he
had
caused
sidwell
to
throw
off
something
of
her
reserve
the
course
dictated
by
prudence
was
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
dignity
to
hold
himself
in
check
in
this
way
he
would
regain
what
he
had
so
disastrously
lost
sidwell
respect
there
was
a
distinct
pleasure
in
this
exercise
of
it
was
something
new
to
him
it
flattered
his
pride
her
learn
that
after
all
i
am
her
superior
let
her
fear
to
lose
me
then
if
her
love
is
still
to
be
depended
upon
she
will
before
long
find
a
way
to
our
union
it
is
in
her
power
if
only
she
wills
it
so
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
short
letter
which
seemed
to
him
a
model
of
dignified
expression
chapter
iv
sidwell
took
no
one
into
her
confidence
the
case
was
not
one
for
counsel
whatever
her
future
action
it
must
result
from
the
maturing
of
from
the
effect
of
circumstance
upon
her
mind
and
heart
for
the
present
she
could
live
in
silence
hear
she
wrote
from
london
to
sylvia
moorhouse
mr
peak
has
left
exeter
and
that
he
is
not
likely
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
being
ordained
you
i
daresay
will
feel
no
surprise
nothing
more
than
that
and
sylvia
comments
in
reply
were
equally
brief
martin
warricombe
after
conversations
with
his
wife
and
with
buckland
felt
it
impossible
not
to
seek
for
an
understanding
of
sidwell
share
in
the
catastrophe
he
was
gravely
perturbed
feeling
that
with
himself
lay
the
chief
responsibility
for
what
had
happened
buckland
attitude
was
that
of
the
man
who
can
only
keep
repeating
told
you
so
warricombe
could
only
lament
and
upbraid
in
the
worse
than
profitless
fashion
natural
to
women
of
her
stamp
but
in
his
daughter
martin
had
every
kind
of
faith
and
he
longed
to
speak
to
her
without
reserve
two
days
after
her
return
from
exeter
he
took
sidwell
apart
and
with
a
distressing
sense
of
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
tried
to
persuade
her
to
frank
utterance
have
been
hearing
strange
reports
he
began
gravely
but
without
show
of
displeasure
you
help
me
to
understand
the
real
facts
of
the
case
sidwell
what
is
your
view
of
peak
behaviour
has
deceived
you
father
was
the
quiet
reply
are
convinced
of
that
it
allows
of
no
ca
be
explained
away
he
pretended
to
believe
what
he
did
not
and
could
not
believe
interested
motives
then
but
not
motives
in
themselves
dishonourable
there
was
a
pause
sidwell
had
spoken
in
a
steady
voice
though
with
eyes
cast
down
whether
her
father
could
understand
a
position
such
as
godwin
she
felt
uncertain
that
he
would
honestly
endeavour
to
do
so
there
could
be
no
doubt
especially
since
he
must
suspect
that
her
own
desire
was
to
distinguish
between
the
man
and
his
fault
but
a
revelation
of
all
that
had
passed
between
her
and
peak
was
not
possible
she
had
the
support
neither
of
intellect
nor
of
passion
it
would
be
asking
for
guidance
the
very
thing
she
had
determined
not
to
do
already
she
found
it
difficult
to
recover
the
impulses
which
had
directed
her
in
that
scene
of
parting
to
talk
of
it
would
be
to
see
her
action
in
such
a
doubtful
light
that
she
might
be
led
to
some
premature
and
irretrievable
resolve
the
only
trustworthy
counsellor
was
time
on
what
time
brought
forth
must
depend
her
future
you
mean
sidwell
resumed
her
father
you
think
it
possible
for
us
to
overlook
this
deception
she
delayed
a
moment
then
said
do
think
it
possible
for
you
to
regard
him
as
a
friend
martin
face
expressed
relief
will
he
remain
in
exeter
should
think
he
can
again
a
pause
martin
was
of
course
puzzled
exceedingly
but
he
began
to
feel
some
assurance
that
peak
need
not
be
regarded
as
a
danger
am
grieved
beyond
expression
he
said
at
length
deliberate
a
fraud
it
seems
to
me
inconsistent
with
any
of
the
qualities
i
thought
i
saw
in
him
it
must
perhaps
to
you
martin
ventured
anxiously
nature
is
not
base
me
i
understand
that
you
spoke
with
him
after
buckland
call
at
his
lodgings
i
saw
him
he
strove
to
persuade
you
that
he
had
some
motive
which
justified
his
conduct
rather
than
justified
it
seems
to
your
satisfaction
ca
answer
that
question
father
my
experience
of
life
is
too
slight
i
can
only
say
that
untruthfulness
in
itself
is
abhorrent
to
me
and
that
i
could
never
try
to
make
it
seem
a
light
thing
surely
is
a
sound
view
think
as
we
may
on
speculative
points
but
allow
me
one
more
question
sidwell
does
it
seem
to
you
that
i
have
no
choice
but
to
break
off
all
communication
with
mr
peak
it
was
the
course
dictated
by
his
own
wish
she
knew
and
what
could
be
gained
by
any
middle
way
between
hearty
goodwill
and
complete
repudiation
time
time
alone
must
work
out
the
problem
i
think
you
have
no
choice
she
answered
i
must
make
inquiries
see
if
he
leaves
the
town
lilywhite
will
know
probably
will
write
before
long
so
the
dialogue
ended
and
neither
sought
to
renew
it
martin
enjoined
upon
his
wife
a
discreet
avoidance
of
the
subject
the
younger
members
of
the
family
were
to
know
nothing
of
what
had
happened
and
if
possible
the
secret
must
be
kept
from
friends
at
exeter
when
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
he
wrote
to
lilywhite
asking
whether
it
was
true
that
peak
had
gone
away
seems
that
private
circumstances
have
obliged
him
to
give
up
his
project
of
taking
orders
possibly
he
has
had
a
talk
with
you
the
clergyman
replied
that
peak
had
left
exeter
have
had
a
letter
from
him
explaining
in
general
terms
his
change
of
views
it
hardly
surprises
me
that
he
has
reconsidered
the
matter
i
do
think
he
was
cut
out
for
clerical
work
he
is
far
more
likely
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
world
of
science
i
suspect
that
conscientious
scruples
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
if
so
all
honour
to
him
the
warricombes
prolonged
their
stay
in
london
until
the
end
of
june
on
their
return
home
martin
was
relieved
to
find
that
scarcely
an
inquiry
was
made
of
him
concerning
peak
the
young
man
disappearance
excited
no
curiosity
in
the
good
people
who
had
come
in
contact
with
him
and
who
were
so
far
from
suspecting
what
a
notable
figure
had
passed
across
their
placid
vision
one
person
only
was
urgent
in
his
questioning
on
an
afternoon
when
mrs
warricombe
and
her
daughters
were
alone
the
rev
bruno
chilvers
made
a
call
he
exclaimed
after
a
few
minutes
conversation
am
so
anxious
to
ask
you
what
has
become
of
mr
peak
soon
after
my
arrival
in
exeter
i
went
to
see
him
and
we
had
a
long
talk
a
most
interesting
talk
then
i
heard
all
at
once
that
he
was
gone
and
that
we
should
see
no
more
of
him
where
is
he
what
is
he
doing
there
was
a
barely
appreciable
delay
before
warricombe
made
answer
have
quite
lost
sight
of
him
she
said
with
an
artificial
smile
know
only
that
he
was
called
away
on
some
urgent
business
family
affairs
i
suppose
chilvers
in
the
most
natural
way
glanced
from
the
speaker
to
sidwell
and
instantly
without
the
slightest
change
of
expression
brought
his
eyes
back
again
hope
most
earnestly
he
went
on
in
his
fluty
tone
he
will
return
a
most
interesting
man
a
man
of
intellectual
scope
and
really
sympathies
i
looked
forward
to
many
a
chat
with
him
has
he
i
wonder
been
led
to
change
his
views
possibly
he
would
find
a
secular
sphere
more
adapted
to
his
special
powers
warricombe
had
nothing
to
say
sidwell
finding
that
mr
smile
now
beamed
in
her
direction
replied
to
him
with
steady
utterance
is
uncommon
i
think
nowadays
for
doubts
to
interfere
with
the
course
of
study
for
ordination
from
uncommon
exclaimed
the
rector
of
margaret
with
almost
joyous
admission
of
the
fact
far
from
uncommon
such
students
have
my
profound
sympathy
i
know
from
experience
exactly
what
it
means
to
be
overcome
in
a
struggle
with
the
modern
spirit
happily
for
myself
i
was
enabled
to
recover
what
for
a
time
i
lost
but
charity
forbid
that
i
should
judge
those
who
think
they
must
needs
voyage
for
ever
in
sunless
gulfs
of
doubt
or
even
absolutely
deny
that
the
human
intellect
can
be
enlightened
from
above
at
a
loss
even
to
follow
this
rhetoric
warricombe
who
was
delighted
to
welcome
the
rev
bruno
and
regarded
him
as
a
gleaming
pillar
of
the
church
made
haste
to
introduce
a
safer
topic
after
that
chilvers
was
seen
at
the
house
with
some
frequency
not
that
he
paid
more
attention
to
the
warricombes
than
to
his
other
acquaintances
relieved
by
his
curate
from
the
uncongenial
burden
of
mere
parish
affairs
he
seemed
to
regard
himself
as
an
apostle
at
large
whose
mission
directed
him
to
the
households
of
people
throughout
the
city
his
brother
clergymen
held
him
in
slight
esteem
in
private
talk
with
martin
warricombe
lilywhite
did
not
hesitate
to
call
him
mountebank
and
to
add
other
depreciatory
remarks
wife
tells
me
and
i
can
trust
her
judgment
in
such
things
that
his
sole
object
just
now
is
to
make
a
good
marriage
rather
disagreeable
stories
seem
to
have
followed
him
from
the
other
side
of
england
he
makes
love
to
all
unmarried
women
never
going
beyond
what
is
thought
permissible
but
doing
a
good
deal
of
mischief
i
fancy
one
lady
in
exeter
i
wo
mention
names
has
already
pulled
him
up
with
a
direct
inquiry
as
to
his
intentions
at
her
house
i
imagine
he
will
no
more
be
seen
the
genial
parson
chuckled
over
his
narrative
and
martin
by
no
means
predisposed
in
the
rev
bruno
favour
took
care
to
report
these
matters
to
his
wife
do
believe
a
word
of
it
exclaimed
warricombe
the
clergy
are
jealous
of
mr
chilvers
of
his
success
with
ladies
it
is
something
new
for
you
to
be
profane
they
are
jealous
of
his
high
reputation
a
serious
charge
against
our
respectable
friends
the
stories
are
all
nonsense
pursued
warricombe
very
wrong
of
lilywhite
to
report
such
things
i
do
believe
any
other
clergyman
would
have
done
so
martin
smiled
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
do
all
through
his
married
life
and
let
the
discussion
rest
there
on
the
next
occasion
of
chilvers
being
at
the
house
he
observed
the
reverend
man
behaviour
with
sidwell
and
was
not
at
all
pleased
bruno
had
a
way
of
addressing
women
which
certainly
went
beyond
the
ordinary
limits
of
courtesy
at
a
little
distance
anyone
would
have
concluded
that
he
was
doing
his
best
to
excite
sidwell
affectionate
interest
the
matter
of
his
discourse
might
be
unobjectionable
but
the
manner
of
it
was
not
in
good
taste
warricombe
was
likewise
observant
but
with
other
emotions
to
her
it
seemed
a
subject
for
pleasurable
reflection
that
chilvers
should
show
interest
in
sidwell
the
rev
bruno
had
bright
prospects
with
the
colour
of
his
orthodoxy
she
did
not
concern
herself
he
was
ticketed
a
term
which
carried
with
it
no
disparagement
and
sidwell
sympathies
were
altogether
with
the
men
of
the
time
drew
near
when
sidwell
must
marry
if
she
ever
meant
to
do
so
and
in
comparison
with
such
candidates
as
mr
walsh
and
godwin
peak
the
rector
of
margaret
would
be
an
ideal
husband
for
her
attitude
towards
chilvers
was
not
encouraging
but
warricombe
suspected
that
a
lingering
regard
for
the
impostor
so
lately
unmasked
still
troubled
her
daughter
mind
a
new
suitor
even
if
rejected
would
help
the
poor
girl
to
dismiss
that
shocking
infatuation
sidwell
and
her
father
nowadays
spent
much
time
together
and
in
the
autumn
days
it
became
usual
for
them
to
have
an
afternoon
ramble
about
the
lanes
their
talk
was
of
science
and
literature
occasionally
skirting
very
close
upon
those
questions
which
both
feared
to
discuss
plainly
for
a
twofold
reason
sidwell
read
much
more
than
had
been
her
wont
and
her
choice
of
authors
would
alone
have
indicated
a
change
in
her
ways
of
thinking
even
if
she
had
not
allowed
it
to
appear
in
the
tenor
of
her
talk
the
questions
she
put
with
reference
to
favourite
studies
were
sometimes
embarrassing
one
day
they
happened
to
meet
chilvers
who
was
driving
with
his
eldest
child
a
boy
of
four
the
narrowness
of
the
road
made
it
impossible
as
martin
would
have
wished
to
greet
and
pass
on
chilvers
stopped
the
carriage
and
jumped
out
sidwell
could
not
but
pay
some
attention
to
the
youthful
chilvers
he
is
ten
years
old
cried
bruno
shall
think
much
more
of
his
body
than
of
his
mind
in
fact
at
this
age
the
body
the
mind
books
books
oh
we
attach
far
too
much
importance
to
them
is
one
of
the
morbific
tendencies
of
our
time
some
one
or
other
has
been
trying
to
frown
down
what
he
calls
the
excessive
athleticism
of
our
public
schools
no
no
let
us
rejoice
that
our
lads
have
such
an
opportunity
of
vigorous
physical
development
the
culture
of
the
body
is
a
great
part
of
religion
he
always
uttered
remarks
of
this
kind
as
if
suggesting
that
his
hearers
should
note
them
in
a
collection
of
aphorisms
to
labour
is
to
pray
so
also
is
the
practice
of
recreation
when
they
had
succeeded
in
getting
away
father
and
daughter
walked
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
at
length
sidwell
asked
with
a
smile
does
this
form
of
christianity
strike
you
very
much
like
a
box
on
the
ear
with
a
perfumed
glove
replied
martin
describes
it
very
well
they
walked
a
little
further
and
sidwell
spoke
in
a
more
serious
tone
chilvers
were
brought
before
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
and
compelled
to
make
a
clear
statement
of
his
faith
what
sect
in
all
the
history
of
heresies
would
he
really
seem
to
belong
to
know
too
little
of
him
and
too
little
of
heresies
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
he
sincerely
believes
the
dogmas
of
his
church
martin
bit
his
lip
and
looked
uneasy
ca
judge
him
sidwell
do
know
she
persisted
seems
to
me
that
he
does
his
best
to
give
us
the
means
of
judging
him
i
half
believe
that
he
often
laughs
in
himself
at
the
success
of
his
audacity
no
i
think
the
man
is
sincere
this
was
very
uncomfortable
ground
but
sidwell
would
not
avoid
it
her
eyes
flashed
and
she
spoke
with
a
vehemence
such
as
martin
had
never
seen
in
her
sincere
in
his
determination
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
but
a
christian
in
any
intelligible
sense
of
that
word
no
he
is
one
type
of
the
successful
man
of
our
day
where
thousands
of
better
and
stronger
men
struggle
vainly
for
fair
recognition
he
and
his
kind
are
glorified
in
comparison
with
a
really
energetic
man
he
is
an
acrobat
the
crowd
stares
at
him
and
applauds
and
there
is
nothing
he
cares
for
so
much
as
that
kind
of
admiration
martin
kept
silence
and
in
a
few
minutes
succeeded
in
broaching
a
wholly
different
subject
not
long
after
this
chilvers
paid
a
call
at
the
conventional
hour
sidwell
hoping
to
escape
invited
two
girls
to
step
out
with
her
on
to
the
lawn
the
sun
was
sinking
and
as
she
stood
with
eyes
fixed
upon
it
the
rev
bruno
voice
disagreeably
broke
her
reverie
she
was
perforce
involved
in
a
dialogue
her
companions
moving
aside
a
magnificent
sky
murmured
chilvers
there
sinks
the
nebulous
star
forgive
me
i
have
fallen
into
a
tiresome
trick
of
quoting
how
differently
a
sunset
is
viewed
nowadays
from
what
it
was
in
old
times
our
impersonal
emotions
are
on
a
higher
plane
do
you
think
so
yes
scientific
discovery
has
done
more
for
religion
than
all
the
ages
of
pious
imagination
a
theory
of
galileo
or
newton
is
more
to
the
soul
than
a
psalm
of
david
think
so
sidwell
asked
coldly
in
everyday
conversation
she
was
less
suave
than
formerly
this
summer
she
had
never
worn
her
spray
of
and
the
omission
might
have
been
deemed
significant
of
a
change
in
herself
when
the
occasion
offered
she
no
longer
hesitated
to
express
a
difference
of
opinion
at
times
she
uttered
her
dissent
with
a
bluntness
which
recalled
buckland
manner
in
private
the
comparison
seem
to
you
unbecoming
said
chilvers
with
genial
condescension
untrue
do
you
mean
by
the
soul
she
inquired
still
gazing
away
from
him
principle
of
conscious
life
in
man
that
which
understands
and
worships
two
faculties
seem
to
me
so
different
that
she
broke
off
i
must
talk
foolishly
about
such
things
feel
sure
you
have
thought
of
them
to
some
purpose
i
wonder
whether
you
ever
read
francis
newman
book
on
i
never
saw
it
me
to
recommend
it
to
you
i
believe
you
would
find
it
deeply
interesting
the
church
approve
it
church
he
smiled
what
church
churchmen
there
are
unfortunately
who
detest
the
name
of
its
author
but
i
hope
you
have
never
classed
me
among
them
the
church
rightly
understood
comprehends
every
mind
and
heart
that
is
striving
upwards
the
age
of
intolerance
will
soon
be
as
remote
from
us
as
that
of
persecution
can
i
be
mistaken
in
thinking
that
this
broader
view
has
your
sympathy
miss
warricombe
ca
sympathise
with
what
i
do
understand
mr
chilvers
he
looked
at
her
with
tender
solicitude
bending
slightly
from
his
usual
attitude
let
me
find
an
opportunity
of
talking
over
the
whole
matter
with
you
by
no
means
as
an
instructor
in
my
view
a
clergyman
may
seek
instruction
from
the
humblest
of
those
who
are
called
his
flock
the
thoughtful
and
among
them
will
often
assist
him
materially
in
his
endeavour
at
to
my
flock
he
continued
playfully
do
belong
but
may
i
not
count
you
one
of
that
circle
of
friends
to
whom
i
look
for
the
higher
kind
of
sympathy
sidwell
glanced
about
her
in
the
hope
that
some
one
might
be
approaching
her
two
friends
were
at
a
distance
talking
and
laughing
together
shall
tell
me
some
day
she
replied
with
more
attention
to
courtesy
the
doctrines
of
the
broad
church
really
are
but
the
air
grows
too
cool
to
be
pleasant
had
we
better
return
to
the
the
greater
part
of
the
winter
went
by
before
she
had
again
to
submit
to
a
with
the
rev
bruno
it
was
seldom
that
she
thought
of
him
save
when
compelled
to
do
so
by
his
exacting
presence
but
in
the
meantime
he
exercised
no
small
influence
on
her
mental
life
insensibly
she
was
confirmed
in
her
alienation
from
all
accepted
forms
of
religious
faith
whether
she
wished
it
or
not
it
was
inevitable
that
such
a
process
should
keep
her
constantly
in
mind
of
godwin
peak
her
desire
to
talk
with
him
at
times
became
so
like
passion
that
she
appeared
to
herself
to
love
him
more
truly
than
ever
yet
such
a
mood
was
always
followed
by
doubt
and
she
could
not
say
whether
the
reaction
distressed
or
soothed
her
these
months
that
had
gone
by
brought
one
result
not
to
be
disguised
whatever
the
true
nature
of
her
feeling
for
godwin
the
thought
of
marrying
him
was
so
difficult
to
face
that
it
seemed
to
involve
impossibilities
he
himself
had
warned
her
that
marriage
would
mean
severance
from
all
her
kindred
it
was
practically
true
and
time
would
only
increase
the
difficulty
of
such
a
determination
the
very
fact
that
her
love
again
if
love
it
were
must
be
indulged
in
defiance
of
universal
opinion
tended
to
keep
emotion
alive
a
woman
is
disposed
to
cling
to
a
lover
who
has
disgraced
himself
especially
if
she
can
believe
that
the
disgrace
was
incurred
as
a
result
of
devotion
to
her
could
love
be
separated
from
thought
of
marriage
sidwell
would
have
encouraged
herself
in
fidelity
happy
in
the
prospect
of
a
spiritual
communion
for
she
would
not
doubt
of
godwin
upward
progress
of
his
eventual
purification
but
this
was
a
mere
dream
if
godwin
passion
were
steadfast
the
day
would
come
when
she
must
decide
either
to
cast
in
her
lot
with
his
or
to
bid
him
be
free
and
could
she
imagine
herself
going
forth
into
exile
there
came
a
letter
from
him
and
she
was
fortunate
enough
to
receive
it
without
the
knowledge
of
her
relatives
he
wrote
that
he
had
obtained
employment
the
news
gave
her
a
troubled
joy
lasting
for
several
days
that
no
emotion
appeared
in
her
reply
was
due
to
a
fear
lest
she
might
be
guilty
of
misleading
him
perhaps
already
she
had
done
so
her
last
whisper
day
was
it
not
a
promise
and
an
appeal
now
she
had
not
the
excuse
of
profound
agitation
there
must
be
no
word
her
conscience
could
not
justify
but
in
writing
those
formal
lines
she
felt
herself
a
coward
she
was
drawing
back
preparing
her
escape
often
she
had
the
letter
beneath
her
pillow
it
was
the
first
she
had
ever
received
from
a
man
who
professed
to
love
her
so
long
without
romance
in
her
life
she
could
not
but
entertain
this
semblance
of
it
and
feel
that
she
was
still
young
it
told
much
in
godwin
favour
that
he
had
not
ventured
to
write
before
there
was
this
news
to
send
her
it
testified
to
the
force
of
his
character
the
purity
of
his
purpose
a
weaker
man
she
knew
would
have
tried
to
excite
her
compassion
by
letters
of
mournful
strain
might
even
have
distressed
her
with
attempts
at
clandestine
meeting
she
had
said
rightly
his
nature
was
not
base
and
she
loved
him
she
was
passionately
grateful
to
him
for
proving
that
her
love
had
not
been
unworthily
bestowed
when
he
wrote
again
her
answer
should
not
be
cowardly
the
life
of
the
household
went
on
as
it
had
been
wont
to
do
for
years
but
with
the
spring
came
events
an
old
lady
died
whilst
on
a
visit
to
the
house
she
was
a
of
warricombe
and
by
a
will
executed
a
few
years
previously
she
left
a
thousand
pounds
to
be
equally
divided
between
the
children
of
this
family
sidwell
smiled
sadly
on
finding
herself
in
possession
of
this
bequest
the
first
sum
of
any
importance
that
she
had
ever
held
in
her
own
right
if
she
married
a
man
of
whom
all
her
kith
and
kin
so
strongly
disapproved
that
they
would
not
give
her
even
a
wedding
present
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
would
be
better
than
no
dowry
at
all
one
could
furnish
a
house
with
it
then
fanny
had
an
attack
of
bronchitis
and
whilst
she
was
recovering
buckland
came
down
for
a
few
days
bringing
with
him
a
piece
of
news
for
which
no
one
was
prepared
as
if
to
make
reparation
to
his
elder
sister
for
the
harshness
with
which
he
had
behaved
in
the
affair
of
godwin
peak
he
chose
her
for
his
first
confidante
i
am
going
to
be
married
do
you
care
to
hear
about
it
i
do
long
ago
she
had
been
assured
of
sylvia
moorhouse
sincerity
in
rejecting
buckland
suit
that
was
still
a
grief
to
her
but
she
acknowledged
her
friend
wisdom
and
was
now
very
curious
to
learn
who
it
was
that
the
radical
had
honoured
with
his
transferred
affections
lady
name
buckland
began
miss
matilda
renshaw
she
is
the
second
daughter
of
a
dealer
in
hides
tallow
and
that
kind
of
thing
both
her
parents
are
dead
she
has
lived
of
late
with
her
married
sister
at
blackheath
sidwell
listened
with
no
slight
astonishment
and
her
countenance
looked
what
she
felt
the
bald
statement
of
the
cause
pursued
her
brother
seeming
to
enjoy
the
consternation
he
had
excited
let
me
fill
up
the
outline
miss
renshaw
is
something
more
than
has
had
an
admirable
education
is
and
for
a
couple
of
years
has
been
actively
engaged
in
humanitarian
work
in
the
east
end
she
has
published
a
book
on
social
questions
and
is
a
very
good
public
speaker
finally
she
owns
property
representing
between
three
and
four
thousand
a
year
picture
has
become
more
attractive
said
sidwell
imagined
a
rather
different
person
if
i
persuade
mother
to
invite
her
down
here
presently
do
you
think
you
could
be
friendly
with
her
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
be
i
must
warn
you
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
creeds
and
dogmas
he
tried
to
read
her
face
sidwell
mind
was
a
mystery
to
him
shall
make
no
inquiry
about
her
religious
views
his
sister
replied
in
a
dispassionate
tone
which
conveyed
no
certain
meaning
i
feel
sure
you
will
like
her
and
equally
sure
that
she
will
like
you
his
parents
had
no
distinct
fault
to
find
with
this
choice
though
they
would
both
greatly
have
preferred
a
whose
genealogy
could
be
more
freely
spoken
of
miss
renshaw
was
invited
to
exeter
and
the
first
week
of
june
saw
her
arrival
buckland
had
in
no
way
exaggerated
her
qualities
she
was
a
beauty
perfect
from
the
social
point
of
view
a
very
interesting
talker
in
short
no
ordinary
woman
that
buckland
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
even
after
sylvia
was
easily
understood
it
seemed
likely
that
she
would
make
him
as
good
a
wife
as
he
could
ever
hope
to
win
sidwell
was
expecting
another
letter
from
the
north
of
england
the
silence
which
during
those
first
months
had
been
justifiable
was
now
a
source
of
anxiety
but
whether
fear
or
hope
predominated
in
her
expectancy
she
still
could
not
decide
she
had
said
to
herself
that
her
next
reply
should
not
be
cowardly
yet
she
was
as
far
as
ever
from
a
courageous
resolve
mental
harassment
told
upon
her
health
martin
watching
her
with
solicitude
declared
that
for
her
sake
as
much
as
for
fanny
they
must
have
a
thorough
holiday
abroad
urged
by
the
approaching
departure
sidwell
overcame
her
reluctance
to
write
to
godwin
before
she
had
a
letter
to
answer
it
was
done
in
a
mood
of
intolerable
despondency
when
life
looked
barren
before
her
and
the
desire
of
love
all
but
triumphed
over
every
other
consideration
the
letter
written
and
posted
she
would
gladly
have
recovered
it
reserved
formal
as
it
was
cowardly
still
but
then
godwin
had
not
written
she
kept
a
watch
upon
the
postman
and
again
when
godwin
reply
was
delivered
escaped
detection
hardly
did
she
dare
to
open
the
envelope
her
letter
had
perchance
been
more
significant
than
she
supposed
and
did
not
the
mere
fact
of
her
writing
invite
a
lover
frankness
but
the
reply
was
hardly
more
moving
than
if
it
had
come
from
a
total
stranger
for
a
moment
she
felt
relieved
in
an
hour
time
she
suffered
indescribable
distress
godwin
wrote
so
she
convinced
herself
after
repeated
perusals
as
if
discharging
a
task
not
a
word
suggested
tenderness
had
the
letter
been
unsolicited
she
could
have
used
it
like
the
former
one
but
it
was
the
answer
to
an
appeal
the
phrases
she
had
used
were
still
present
in
her
mind
am
anxious
it
is
more
than
half
a
year
since
you
wrote
i
have
been
expecting
anything
that
is
of
interest
to
you
will
interest
me
how
could
she
imagine
that
this
was
reserved
and
formal
shame
fell
upon
her
she
locked
herself
from
all
companionship
and
wept
in
rebellion
against
the
laws
of
life
a
fortnight
later
she
wrote
from
royat
to
sylvia
moorhouse
it
was
a
long
epistle
full
of
sunny
descriptions
breathing
renewed
vigour
of
body
and
mind
the
last
paragraph
ran
thus
was
my
birthday
i
was
at
this
age
it
is
wisdom
in
a
woman
to
remind
herself
that
youth
is
over
i
do
regret
it
let
it
go
with
all
its
follies
but
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
no
serious
work
in
life
it
is
not
cheerful
to
look
forward
to
perhaps
another
years
of
elegant
leisure
that
is
to
say
of
wearisome
idleness
what
can
i
do
try
and
think
of
some
task
for
me
something
that
will
last
a
lifetime
part
vii
chapter
i
at
the
close
of
a
sultry
day
in
september
when
factory
fumes
hung
low
over
the
town
of
helen
and
twilight
thickened
luridly
and
the
air
tasted
of
sulphur
and
the
noises
of
the
streets
muffled
in
their
joint
effect
had
individually
an
ominous
distinctness
godwin
peak
walked
with
languid
steps
to
his
lodgings
and
the
meal
that
there
awaited
him
his
vitality
was
at
low
ebb
the
routine
of
his
life
disgusted
him
the
hope
of
release
was
a
mockery
what
was
to
be
the
limit
of
this
effort
to
redeem
his
character
how
many
years
before
the
past
could
be
forgotten
and
his
claim
to
the
style
of
honourable
be
deemed
secure
rubbish
it
was
an
idea
out
of
romances
what
he
was
he
was
and
no
extent
of
dogged
duration
at
helen
or
elsewhere
could
affect
his
personality
what
practically
was
to
be
the
end
if
sidwell
had
no
money
of
her
own
and
no
expectations
from
her
father
how
could
she
ever
become
his
wife
women
liked
this
kind
of
thing
this
indefinite
engagement
to
marry
when
something
should
happen
which
in
all
likelihood
never
would
happen
this
fantastic
mutual
fidelity
with
only
the
airiest
reward
especially
women
of
a
certain
age
a
heavy
cart
seemed
to
be
rumbling
in
the
next
street
no
it
was
thunder
if
only
a
good
rattling
storm
would
sweep
the
bituminous
atmosphere
and
allow
a
breath
of
pure
air
before
midnight
she
could
not
be
far
from
thirty
of
course
there
prevails
much
conventional
nonsense
about
women
age
there
are
plenty
of
women
who
reckon
four
decades
and
yet
retain
all
the
essential
charm
of
their
sex
and
as
a
man
gets
older
as
he
begins
to
persuade
himself
that
at
forty
one
has
scarce
reached
the
prime
of
life
the
storm
was
coming
on
in
earnest
big
drops
began
to
fall
he
quickened
his
pace
reached
home
and
rang
the
bell
for
a
light
his
landlady
came
in
with
the
announcement
that
a
gentleman
had
called
to
see
him
about
an
hour
ago
he
would
come
again
at
seven
name
none
had
been
given
a
youngish
gentleman
speaking
like
a
londoner
it
might
be
earwaker
but
that
was
not
likely
godwin
sat
down
to
his
plain
meal
and
after
it
lit
a
pipe
thunder
was
still
rolling
but
now
in
the
distance
he
waited
impatiently
for
seven
to
the
minute
sounded
a
knock
at
the
a
little
delay
and
there
appeared
christian
moxey
godwin
was
surprised
and
embarrassed
his
visitor
had
a
very
grave
face
and
was
thinner
paler
than
three
years
ago
he
appeared
to
hesitate
but
at
length
offered
his
hand
got
your
address
from
earwaker
i
was
obliged
to
see
you
on
business
i
take
my
coat
off
we
shall
have
to
talk
they
sat
down
and
godwin
unable
to
strike
the
note
of
friendship
lest
he
should
be
met
with
repulse
broke
silence
by
regretting
that
moxey
should
have
had
to
make
a
second
call
that
nothing
i
went
and
had
peak
my
sister
is
dead
their
eyes
met
something
of
the
old
kindness
rose
to
either
face
must
be
a
heavy
blow
to
you
murmured
godwin
possessed
with
a
strange
anticipation
which
he
would
not
allow
to
take
clear
form
is
she
was
ill
for
three
months
whilst
staying
in
the
country
last
june
she
met
with
an
accident
she
went
for
a
long
walk
alone
one
day
and
in
a
steep
lane
she
came
up
with
a
carter
who
was
trying
to
make
a
wretched
horse
drag
a
load
beyond
its
strength
the
fellow
was
perhaps
half
drunk
he
stood
there
beating
the
horse
unmercifully
marcella
could
endure
that
kind
of
thing
impossible
for
her
to
pass
on
and
say
nothing
she
interfered
and
tried
to
persuade
the
man
to
lighten
his
cart
he
was
insolent
attacked
the
horse
more
furiously
than
ever
and
kicked
it
so
violently
in
the
stomach
that
it
fell
even
then
he
would
stop
his
brutality
marcella
tried
to
get
between
him
and
the
animal
just
as
it
lashed
out
with
its
heels
the
poor
girl
was
so
badly
injured
that
she
lay
by
the
roadside
until
another
carter
took
her
up
and
brought
her
back
to
the
village
three
months
of
accursed
suffering
and
then
happily
came
the
end
a
far
faint
echoing
of
thunder
filled
the
silence
of
their
voices
heavy
rain
splashed
upon
the
pavement
said
to
me
just
before
her
death
resumed
christian
i
have
ill
luck
when
i
try
to
do
a
kindness
but
perhaps
there
is
one
more
chance
i
did
know
what
she
meant
till
afterwards
peak
she
has
left
nearly
all
her
money
to
you
godwin
knew
it
before
the
words
were
spoken
his
heart
leaped
and
only
the
dread
of
being
observed
enabled
him
to
control
his
features
when
his
tongue
was
released
he
said
harshly
course
i
ca
accept
it
the
words
were
uttered
independently
of
his
will
he
had
no
such
thought
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
shook
him
with
alarm
ca
you
returned
christian
have
no
right
it
belongs
to
you
or
to
some
other
relative
it
would
be
his
stammering
broke
off
flushes
and
chills
ran
through
him
he
could
not
raise
his
eyes
from
the
ground
belongs
to
no
one
but
you
said
moxey
with
cold
persistence
last
wish
was
to
do
you
a
kindness
and
i
at
all
events
shall
never
consent
to
frustrate
her
intention
the
legacy
represents
something
more
than
eight
hundred
a
year
as
the
investments
now
stand
this
will
make
you
independent
of
everything
and
everybody
he
looked
meaningly
at
the
listener
own
life
was
not
a
very
happy
one
she
did
what
she
could
to
save
yours
from
a
like
doom
godwin
at
last
looked
up
she
speak
of
me
during
her
illness
asked
me
once
soon
after
the
accident
what
had
become
of
you
as
i
knew
from
earwaker
i
was
able
to
tell
her
a
long
silence
followed
christian
voice
was
softer
when
he
resumed
never
knew
her
she
was
the
one
woman
in
ten
thousand
at
once
strong
and
gentle
a
fine
intellect
and
a
heart
of
rare
tenderness
but
because
she
had
not
the
kind
of
face
that
he
checked
himself
the
end
her
mind
kept
its
clearness
and
courage
one
day
she
reminded
me
of
heine
how
we
had
talked
of
that
conversion
on
the
and
had
pitied
the
noble
intellect
subdued
by
disease
i
sha
live
long
enough
she
said
to
incur
that
danger
what
i
have
thought
ever
since
i
could
study
i
think
now
and
shall
to
the
last
moment
i
buried
her
without
forms
of
any
kind
in
the
cemetery
at
kingsmill
that
was
what
she
wished
i
should
have
despised
myself
if
i
had
lacked
that
courage
was
right
muttered
godwin
i
wear
no
mourning
you
see
all
that
kind
of
thing
is
ignoble
i
am
robbed
of
a
priceless
companionship
but
i
do
care
to
go
about
inviting
people
pity
if
only
i
could
forget
those
months
of
suffering
some
day
i
shall
perhaps
and
think
of
her
only
as
she
lived
you
alone
with
her
all
the
time
our
cousin
janet
was
often
with
us
christian
spoke
with
averted
face
do
know
of
course
that
she
has
gone
in
for
medical
work
practises
at
kingsmill
the
accident
was
at
a
village
called
lowton
ten
miles
or
more
from
kingsmill
janet
came
over
very
often
godwin
mused
on
this
development
of
the
girl
whom
he
remembered
so
well
he
could
not
direct
his
thoughts
a
languor
had
crept
over
him
you
recollect
peak
said
christian
presently
talk
we
had
in
the
fields
by
twybridge
when
we
first
met
the
old
friendliness
was
reappearing
in
his
manner
he
was
yielding
to
the
impulse
to
be
communicative
confidential
which
had
always
characterised
him
remember
godwin
murmured
only
my
words
then
had
had
any
weight
with
you
and
if
only
i
had
acted
upon
my
own
advice
just
for
those
few
weeks
i
was
sane
i
understood
something
of
life
i
saw
my
true
way
before
me
you
and
i
have
both
gone
after
ruinous
ideals
instead
of
taking
the
solid
good
held
out
to
us
of
course
i
know
your
story
in
outline
i
do
ask
you
to
talk
about
it
you
are
independent
now
and
i
hope
you
can
use
your
well
and
i
too
am
free
the
last
words
were
in
a
lower
tone
godwin
glanced
at
the
speaker
whose
sadness
was
not
banished
but
illumined
with
a
ray
of
calm
hope
you
ever
thought
of
me
and
my
infatuation
christian
asked
have
outlived
that
mawkish
folly
i
used
to
drink
too
much
the
two
things
went
well
together
it
would
shame
me
to
tell
you
all
about
it
but
happily
i
have
been
able
to
go
back
about
thirteen
years
recover
my
old
sane
self
and
with
it
what
i
then
threw
away
understand
you
marcella
knew
of
it
just
before
her
death
and
it
made
her
glad
but
the
waste
of
years
the
best
part
of
a
lifetime
incredible
to
me
as
i
look
back
janet
called
on
us
one
day
in
london
heaven
be
thanked
that
she
was
forgiving
enough
to
do
so
what
would
have
become
of
me
now
are
you
going
to
live
then
godwin
asked
absently
my
income
is
sufficient
no
i
mean
where
and
how
will
you
live
in
your
married
life
still
uncertain
janet
must
go
on
with
professional
work
in
any
case
i
do
think
she
could
for
long
her
strength
is
equal
to
it
but
i
should
wonder
if
we
settle
in
kingsmill
to
you
it
would
seem
intolerable
but
why
should
we
live
in
london
at
kingsmill
janet
has
a
large
circle
of
friends
in
london
we
know
scarcely
people
of
the
kind
it
would
give
us
any
pleasure
to
live
with
we
shall
have
no
lack
of
intellectual
society
janet
knows
some
of
the
whitelaw
professors
the
atmosphere
of
kingsmill
is
illiberal
you
know
we
sha
be
fought
shy
of
because
we
object
to
pass
sundays
in
a
state
of
coma
but
the
years
that
i
have
lost
the
irrecoverable
years
nothing
so
idle
as
regretting
the
past
said
godwin
with
some
impatience
groan
over
what
could
be
otherwise
the
probability
is
janet
and
you
are
far
better
suited
to
each
other
now
than
you
ever
would
have
been
if
you
had
married
long
ago
think
that
exclaimed
the
other
eagerly
have
tried
to
see
it
in
that
light
if
i
did
feel
so
despicable
i
take
it
does
think
you
so
godwin
muttered
how
can
she
understand
i
have
tried
to
tell
her
everything
but
she
refused
to
listen
perhaps
marcella
told
her
all
she
cared
to
know
doubt
each
brooded
for
a
while
over
his
own
affairs
then
christian
reverted
to
the
subject
which
concerned
them
both
us
speak
frankly
you
will
take
this
gift
of
marcella
as
it
was
meant
how
it
meant
critic
and
analyst
as
ever
godwin
could
not
be
content
to
see
in
it
the
simple
benefaction
of
a
woman
who
died
loving
him
was
it
not
rather
the
last
subtle
device
of
jealousy
marcella
knew
that
the
legacy
would
be
a
temptation
he
could
scarcely
resist
and
knew
at
the
same
time
that
if
he
accepted
it
he
practically
renounced
his
hope
of
marrying
sidwell
warricombe
doubtless
she
had
learned
as
much
as
she
needed
to
know
of
position
refusing
this
bequest
he
was
as
far
as
ever
from
the
possibility
of
asking
sidwell
to
marry
him
profiting
by
it
he
stood
for
ever
indebted
to
marcella
must
needs
be
grateful
to
her
and
some
day
assuredly
would
reveal
the
truth
to
whatever
woman
became
his
wife
conflict
of
reasonings
and
emotions
made
it
difficult
to
answer
moxey
question
must
take
time
to
think
of
it
he
said
at
length
i
suppose
that
is
right
but
well
i
know
so
little
of
your
circumstances
that
strictly
true
peak
asked
i
have
only
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
you
have
been
doing
since
you
left
us
of
course
i
have
tried
to
find
out
godwin
smiled
rather
gloomily
wo
talk
of
it
i
suppose
you
stay
in
helen
for
the
night
a
train
at
i
had
better
go
by
it
let
us
forget
everything
but
your
own
cheerful
outlook
at
ten
i
walk
with
you
to
the
station
reluctantly
at
first
but
before
long
with
a
quiet
abandonment
to
the
joy
that
would
not
be
suppressed
christian
talked
of
his
future
wife
in
janet
he
found
every
perfection
her
mind
was
something
more
than
the
companion
of
his
own
already
she
had
begun
to
inspire
him
with
a
hopeful
activity
and
to
foster
the
elements
of
true
manliness
which
he
was
conscious
of
possessing
though
they
had
never
yet
had
free
play
with
a
sense
of
luxurious
safety
he
submitted
to
her
influence
knowing
none
the
less
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
complete
her
imperfect
life
studiously
he
avoided
the
word
from
such
vaporous
illusions
he
had
turned
to
the
world
actualities
his
language
dealt
with
concretes
with
homely
satisfactions
with
prospects
near
enough
to
be
soberly
examined
a
hurry
to
catch
the
train
facilitated
parting
godwin
promised
to
write
in
a
few
days
he
took
a
roundabout
way
back
to
his
lodgings
the
rain
was
over
the
sky
had
become
placid
he
was
conscious
of
an
effect
from
conversation
which
half
counteracted
the
mood
he
would
otherwise
have
indulged
the
joy
of
liberty
and
of
an
outlook
wholly
new
sidwell
might
perchance
be
to
him
all
that
janet
was
to
christian
was
it
not
the
luring
of
that
prompted
him
to
turn
away
from
his
long
hope
there
must
be
no
more
untruthfulness
sidwell
must
have
all
the
facts
laid
before
her
and
make
her
choice
without
a
clear
understanding
of
what
he
was
going
to
write
he
sat
down
at
eleven
and
began
miss
warricombe
why
not
sidwell
he
took
another
sheet
of
paper
sidwell
i
can
remember
only
your
last
word
to
me
when
we
parted
i
can
not
address
you
coldly
as
though
half
a
stranger
thus
long
i
have
kept
silence
about
everything
but
the
outward
events
of
my
life
now
in
telling
you
of
something
that
has
happened
i
must
speak
as
i
think
this
evening
i
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
christian
moxey
a
name
you
know
he
came
to
tell
me
that
his
sister
she
of
whom
i
once
spoke
to
you
was
dead
and
had
bequeathed
to
me
a
large
sum
of
money
he
said
that
it
represented
an
income
of
eight
hundred
pounds
knew
nothing
of
miss
moxey
illness
and
the
news
of
her
will
came
to
me
as
a
surprise
in
word
or
deed
i
never
sought
more
than
her
simple
friendship
and
even
i
believed
myself
to
have
forfeited
i
were
to
refuse
this
money
it
would
be
in
consequence
of
a
scruple
which
i
do
not
in
truth
respect
christian
moxey
tells
me
that
his
sister
desire
was
to
enable
me
to
live
the
life
of
a
free
man
and
if
i
have
any
duty
at
all
in
the
matter
surely
it
does
not
constrain
me
to
defeat
her
kindness
no
condition
whatever
is
attached
the
gift
releases
me
from
the
necessity
of
leading
a
hopeless
existence
leaves
me
at
liberty
to
direct
my
life
how
i
will
wish
then
to
put
aside
all
thoughts
of
how
this
opportunity
came
to
me
and
to
ask
you
if
you
are
willing
to
be
my
wife
i
have
never
written
a
word
of
love
my
love
is
unchanged
the
passionate
hope
of
three
years
ago
still
rules
my
life
is
love
strong
enough
to
enable
you
to
disregard
all
hindrances
i
can
not
of
course
know
whether
in
your
sight
dishonour
still
clings
to
me
or
whether
you
understand
me
well
enough
to
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
those
hateful
things
in
the
past
is
it
yet
too
soon
do
you
wish
me
still
to
wait
still
to
prove
myself
is
your
interest
in
the
free
man
less
than
in
the
slave
for
my
life
has
been
one
of
slavery
and
exile
exile
if
you
know
what
i
mean
by
it
from
the
day
of
my
birth
grant
me
this
great
happiness
we
can
live
where
we
will
i
am
not
rich
enough
to
promise
all
the
comforts
and
refinements
to
which
you
are
accustomed
but
we
should
be
safe
from
sordid
anxieties
we
can
travel
we
can
make
a
home
in
any
european
city
it
would
be
idle
to
speak
of
the
projects
and
ambitions
that
fill
my
mind
but
surely
i
may
do
something
worth
doing
win
some
position
among
intellectual
men
of
which
you
would
not
be
ashamed
you
yourself
urged
me
to
hope
that
with
you
at
my
side
sidwell
grant
me
this
chance
that
i
may
know
the
joy
of
satisfied
love
i
am
past
the
age
which
is
misled
by
vain
fancies
i
have
suffered
unspeakably
longed
for
the
calm
strength
the
pure
steady
purpose
which
would
result
to
me
from
a
happy
marriage
there
is
no
fatal
divergence
between
our
minds
did
you
not
tell
me
that
you
said
that
if
i
had
been
truthful
from
the
first
you
might
have
loved
me
with
no
misgiving
forget
the
madness
into
which
i
was
betrayed
there
is
no
soil
upon
my
spirit
i
offer
you
love
as
noble
as
any
man
is
capable
of
think
think
well
before
replying
to
me
let
your
true
self
prevail
you
love
me
yours
ever
godwin
peak
at
first
he
wrote
slowly
as
though
engaged
on
a
literary
composition
with
erasions
insertions
facts
once
stated
he
allowed
himself
to
forget
how
sidwell
would
most
likely
view
them
and
thereafter
his
pen
hastened
fervour
inspired
the
last
paragraph
sidwell
image
had
become
present
to
him
and
exercised
all
or
nearly
all
its
old
influence
the
letter
must
be
copied
because
of
that
laboured
beginning
copying
one
own
words
is
at
all
times
a
disenchanting
drudgery
and
when
the
end
was
reached
godwin
signed
his
name
with
hasty
contempt
what
answer
could
he
expect
to
such
an
appeal
how
vast
an
improbability
that
sidwell
would
consent
to
profit
by
the
gift
of
marcella
moxey
yet
how
otherwise
could
he
write
with
what
show
of
sincerity
could
he
to
refuse
the
bequest
nay
in
that
case
he
must
not
offer
to
do
so
but
simply
state
the
fact
that
his
refusal
was
beyond
recall
logically
he
had
chosen
the
only
course
open
to
him
for
to
refuse
independence
was
impossible
a
wheezy
clock
in
his
landlady
kitchen
was
striking
two
for
very
fear
of
having
to
revise
his
letter
in
the
morning
he
put
it
into
its
envelope
and
went
out
to
the
nearest
that
was
done
whether
sidwell
answered
with
or
with
he
was
a
free
man
on
the
morrow
he
went
to
his
work
as
usual
and
on
the
day
after
that
the
third
morning
might
bring
a
reply
but
did
not
on
the
evening
of
the
fifth
day
when
he
came
home
there
lay
the
expected
letter
he
felt
it
it
was
light
and
thin
that
hideous
choking
of
suspense
well
it
ran
thus
can
not
it
is
not
that
i
am
troubled
by
your
accepting
the
legacy
you
have
every
right
to
do
so
and
i
know
that
your
life
will
justify
the
hopes
of
her
who
thus
befriended
you
but
i
am
too
weak
to
take
this
step
to
ask
you
to
wait
yet
longer
would
only
be
a
fresh
cowardice
you
can
not
know
how
it
shames
me
to
write
this
in
my
very
heart
i
believe
i
love
you
but
what
is
such
love
worth
you
must
despise
me
and
you
will
forget
me
i
live
in
a
little
world
in
the
greater
world
where
your
place
is
you
will
win
a
love
very
different
godwin
laughed
aloud
as
the
paper
dropped
from
his
hand
well
she
was
not
the
heroine
of
a
romance
had
he
expected
her
to
leave
home
and
kindred
the
world
so
infinitely
dear
to
her
and
go
forth
with
a
man
deeply
dishonoured
very
young
girls
have
been
known
to
do
such
a
thing
but
a
thoughtful
mature
woman
present
his
passion
had
dominated
her
and
perhaps
her
nerves
only
but
she
had
had
time
to
recover
from
that
weakness
a
woman
like
most
women
of
cool
blood
temperate
fancies
a
domestic
woman
the
ornament
of
a
typical
english
home
most
likely
it
was
true
that
the
matter
of
the
legacy
did
not
trouble
her
in
any
case
she
would
not
have
consented
to
marry
him
and
she
knew
no
jealousy
her
love
why
truly
what
was
it
worth
much
much
of
no
less
than
infinite
value
he
knew
it
but
this
was
not
the
moment
for
such
a
truth
a
cup
of
tea
to
steady
the
nerves
then
thoughts
planning
he
was
awake
all
night
and
sidwell
letter
lay
within
did
sleep
calmly
had
she
never
stretched
out
her
hand
for
letter
when
all
was
silent
there
were
men
who
would
not
take
such
a
refusal
a
scheme
to
meet
her
once
more
the
appeal
of
passion
face
to
face
heart
to
heart
the
means
of
escape
ready
and
then
the
world
but
neither
was
he
cast
in
heroic
mould
he
had
not
the
he
had
not
the
hot
youthful
blood
a
critic
of
life
an
analyst
of
moods
and
motives
not
the
man
who
dares
and
acts
the
only
important
resolve
he
had
ever
carried
through
was
a
scheme
of
ignoble
trickery
to
end
in
frustration
greater
world
it
was
a
phrase
that
had
been
in
his
own
mind
once
or
twice
since
moxey
visit
to
point
him
thither
was
doubtless
the
one
service
sidwell
could
render
him
and
in
a
day
or
two
that
phrase
was
all
that
remained
to
him
of
her
letter
on
a
sunday
afternoon
at
the
end
of
october
godwin
once
more
climbed
the
familiar
stairs
at
staple
inn
and
was
welcomed
by
his
friend
earwaker
the
visit
was
by
appointment
earwaker
knew
all
about
the
legacy
that
it
was
accepted
and
that
peak
had
only
a
few
days
to
spend
in
london
on
his
way
to
the
continent
are
regenerated
was
his
remark
as
godwin
entered
i
look
it
just
what
i
feel
i
have
shaken
off
a
good
or
a
bad
ten
years
the
speaker
face
at
all
events
in
this
moment
was
no
longer
that
of
a
man
at
hungry
issue
with
the
world
he
spoke
cheerily
is
often
that
fortune
does
a
man
such
a
kind
turn
one
often
hears
it
said
if
only
i
could
begin
life
again
with
all
the
experience
i
have
gained
that
is
what
i
do
i
can
break
utterly
with
the
past
and
i
have
learnt
how
to
live
in
the
future
utterly
with
the
past
the
practical
sense
and
even
morally
to
a
great
extent
earwaker
pushed
a
box
of
cigars
across
the
table
godwin
accepted
the
offer
and
began
to
smoke
during
these
moments
of
silence
the
man
of
letters
had
been
turning
over
a
weekly
paper
as
if
in
search
of
some
paragraph
a
smile
announced
his
discovery
is
something
that
will
interest
you
possibly
you
have
seen
it
he
began
to
read
aloud
on
the
inst
was
celebrated
at
bragg
torquay
the
marriage
of
the
rev
bruno
leathwaite
chilvers
late
rector
of
st
margaret
exeter
and
the
hon
bertha
harriet
cecilia
jute
eldest
daughter
of
the
late
baron
jute
the
ceremony
was
conducted
by
the
hon
and
rev
jute
uncle
of
the
bride
assisted
by
the
rev
miller
the
very
rev
dean
pinnock
the
rev
crook
and
the
rev
william
tomkinson
the
bride
was
given
away
by
lord
jute
mr
horatio
dukinfield
was
best
man
the
bridal
dress
was
of
white
brocade
draped
with
brussels
lace
the
corsage
being
trimmed
with
lace
and
adorned
with
orange
blossoms
the
tulle
veil
fastened
with
three
diamond
stars
the
gifts
of
well
shall
i
go
on
triumph
of
chilvers
murmured
godwin
wonder
whether
the
hon
bertha
is
past
her
fortieth
year
blooming
beauty
i
dare
say
but
lord
how
many
people
it
takes
to
marry
a
man
like
chilvers
how
sacred
the
union
must
be
pray
take
a
paragraph
more
the
four
bridesmaids
miss
wore
cream
crepon
dresses
trimmed
with
turquoise
blue
velvet
and
hats
to
match
the
bridegroom
presents
to
them
were
diamond
and
ruby
brooches
so
he
is
no
longer
at
exeter
has
no
living
it
seems
what
does
he
aim
at
next
i
wonder
earwaker
cast
meaning
glances
at
his
friend
understand
you
said
godwin
at
length
mean
that
this
merely
illustrates
my
own
ambition
well
you
are
right
i
confess
my
shame
and
there
an
end
of
it
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
resuming
presently
it
would
be
untrue
if
i
said
that
i
regretted
anything
constituted
as
i
am
there
was
no
other
way
of
learning
my
real
needs
and
capabilities
much
in
the
past
is
hateful
to
me
but
it
all
had
its
use
there
are
men
why
take
your
own
case
you
look
back
on
life
no
doubt
with
calm
and
satisfaction
with
resignation
godwin
let
his
cigar
fall
and
laughed
bitterly
resignation
has
kept
pace
with
life
i
was
always
a
rebel
my
good
qualities
i
mean
what
i
say
have
always
wrecked
me
now
that
i
have
to
fight
with
circumstances
they
may
possibly
be
made
subservient
to
my
happiness
what
form
is
your
happiness
to
take
i
am
leaving
england
on
the
continent
i
shall
make
no
fixed
abode
but
live
in
the
places
where
cosmopolitan
people
are
to
be
met
i
shall
make
friends
with
money
at
command
one
may
hope
to
succeed
in
that
hotels
and
so
on
offer
the
opportunities
it
sounds
oddly
like
the
project
of
a
swindler
does
it
there
the
curse
i
ca
escape
from
though
my
desires
are
as
pure
as
those
of
any
man
living
i
am
compelled
to
express
myself
as
if
i
were
about
to
do
something
base
and
underhand
simply
because
i
have
never
had
a
social
place
i
am
an
individual
merely
i
belong
to
no
class
town
family
club
people
mused
earwaker
ideal
is
transformed
you
know
experience
only
could
bring
that
about
i
seek
now
only
the
free
intellectual
people
men
who
have
done
with
the
old
conceptions
women
who
his
voice
grew
husky
and
he
did
not
complete
the
sentence
shall
find
them
in
paris
earwaker
think
of
my
being
able
to
speak
like
this
no
but
actual
sober
plans
their
execution
to
begin
in
a
day
or
two
paris
rome
and
a
month
ago
i
was
a
hopeless
slave
in
a
vile
manufacturing
i
wish
it
were
possible
for
me
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
that
poor
dead
woman
i
do
speak
to
you
of
her
but
do
you
imagine
i
am
brutally
forgetful
of
her
to
whom
i
owe
all
this
do
you
justice
returned
the
other
quietly
believe
you
can
and
do
grand
it
is
to
go
forth
as
i
am
now
going
godwin
resumed
after
a
long
pause
to
hide
no
shams
no
pretences
let
who
will
inquire
about
me
i
am
an
independent
englishman
with
so
and
so
much
a
year
in
england
i
have
one
friend
only
that
is
you
the
result
you
see
of
all
these
years
savage
striving
to
knit
myself
into
the
social
fabric
you
will
invite
me
some
day
to
your
villa
at
sorrento
said
earwaker
encouragingly
i
shall
godwin
eyes
flashed
with
imaginative
delight
before
very
long
never
to
a
home
in
england
a
request
i
have
never
had
your
portrait
sit
before
you
leave
london
i
send
you
one
from
paris
it
will
be
better
done
i
am
serious
you
promise
shall
have
the
thing
in
less
than
a
fortnight
the
promise
was
kept
earwaker
received
an
admirable
photograph
which
he
inserted
in
his
album
with
a
curious
sense
of
satisfaction
a
face
by
which
every
intelligent
eye
must
be
arrested
which
no
two
observers
would
interpret
in
the
same
way
mate
must
be
somewhere
thought
the
man
of
letters
he
will
never
find
her
chapter
ii
in
his
acceptance
of
sidwell
reply
peak
did
not
care
to
ask
himself
whether
the
delay
of
its
arrival
had
any
meaning
one
way
or
another
decency
would
hardly
have
permitted
her
to
answer
such
a
letter
by
return
of
post
of
course
she
waited
a
day
or
so
but
the
interval
meant
more
than
this
sylvia
moorhouse
was
staying
with
her
friend
the
death
of
mrs
moorhouse
and
the
marriage
of
the
mathematical
brother
had
left
sylvia
homeless
though
not
in
any
distressing
sense
her
inclination
was
to
wander
for
a
year
or
two
and
she
remained
in
england
only
until
the
needful
arrangements
could
be
concluded
had
better
come
with
me
she
said
to
sidwell
as
they
walked
together
on
the
lawn
after
luncheon
the
other
shook
her
head
you
had
what
are
you
doing
here
what
are
you
going
to
make
of
your
life
do
know
yet
one
ought
to
live
on
some
kind
of
plan
i
think
it
is
time
you
got
away
from
exeter
it
seems
to
me
you
are
finding
its
atmosphere
sidwell
laughed
at
the
allusion
know
she
said
the
reverend
gentleman
is
shortly
to
be
married
yes
i
have
heard
all
about
it
but
is
he
forsaking
the
church
only
for
a
time
they
say
the
question
sidwell
did
he
honour
you
with
a
proposal
no
one
told
me
it
was
imminent
not
long
ago
a
mistake
sidwell
answered
with
her
grave
smile
chilvers
had
a
singular
manner
with
women
in
general
it
was
meant
perhaps
for
subtle
flattery
he
may
have
thought
it
the
most
suitable
return
for
the
female
worship
he
was
accustomed
to
receive
warricombe
was
coming
towards
them
he
brought
a
new
subject
of
conversation
and
as
they
talked
the
trio
drew
near
to
the
gate
which
led
into
the
road
the
afternoon
postman
was
just
entering
mr
warricombe
took
from
him
two
letters
for
you
sylvia
and
one
for
you
sidwell
a
slight
change
in
his
voice
caused
sidwell
to
look
at
her
father
as
he
handed
her
the
letter
in
the
same
moment
she
recognised
the
writing
of
the
address
it
was
godwin
peak
and
undoubtedly
her
father
knew
it
with
a
momentary
hesitation
warricombe
continued
his
talk
from
the
point
at
which
he
had
broken
off
but
he
avoided
his
daughter
look
and
sidwell
was
too
well
aware
of
an
uneasiness
which
had
fallen
upon
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
brought
the
chat
to
an
end
and
walked
away
towards
the
house
sidwell
held
her
letter
tightly
conversation
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
she
had
a
painful
throbbing
of
the
heart
and
felt
that
her
face
must
be
playing
traitor
fortunately
sylvia
found
it
necessary
to
write
a
reply
to
the
missive
she
had
received
and
her
companion
was
soon
at
liberty
to
seek
solitude
for
more
than
an
hour
she
remained
alone
however
unemotional
the
contents
of
the
letter
its
arrival
would
have
perturbed
her
seriously
as
in
the
two
previous
instances
what
she
found
on
opening
the
envelope
threw
her
into
so
extreme
an
agitation
that
it
was
long
before
she
could
subdue
the
anguish
of
disorder
in
all
her
senses
she
had
tried
to
believe
that
godwin
peak
was
henceforth
powerless
to
affect
her
in
this
way
write
what
he
would
the
romance
of
her
life
was
over
time
had
brought
the
solution
of
difficulties
to
which
she
looked
forward
she
recognised
the
inevitable
as
doubtless
did
godwin
also
but
all
this
was
the
passionate
letter
delighted
as
much
as
it
tortured
her
in
secret
her
heart
had
desired
this
though
reason
suppressed
and
denied
the
hope
no
longer
need
she
remember
with
pangs
of
shame
the
last
letter
she
had
written
and
the
cold
response
once
again
things
were
as
they
should
be
the
lover
pleading
before
her
she
with
the
control
of
his
fate
the
injury
to
her
pride
was
healed
and
in
the
thought
that
perforce
she
must
answer
with
a
final
she
found
at
first
more
of
solace
than
of
distress
subsidence
of
physical
suffering
allowed
her
to
forget
this
emotion
in
its
nature
unavowable
she
could
think
of
the
news
godwin
sent
could
torment
herself
with
interpretations
of
marcella
moxey
behaviour
and
view
in
detail
the
circumstances
which
enabled
godwin
to
urge
a
formal
suit
among
her
various
thoughts
there
recurred
frequently
a
regret
that
this
letter
had
not
reached
her
like
the
other
two
unobserved
her
father
had
now
learnt
that
she
was
in
correspondence
with
the
disgraced
man
to
keep
silence
would
be
to
cause
him
grave
trouble
yet
how
much
better
if
fortune
had
only
once
more
favoured
her
so
that
the
story
might
have
remained
her
secret
from
beginning
to
end
for
was
not
this
the
end
at
the
usual
time
she
went
to
the
and
somehow
succeeded
in
conversing
as
though
nothing
had
disturbed
her
mr
warricombe
was
not
seen
till
dinner
when
he
came
forth
sidwell
noticed
his
air
of
preoccupation
and
that
he
avoided
addressing
her
the
evening
asked
too
much
of
her
she
again
withdrew
and
only
came
back
when
the
household
was
ready
for
retiring
in
bidding
her
father
goodnight
she
forced
herself
to
meet
his
gaze
he
looked
at
her
with
troubled
inquiry
and
she
felt
her
cheek
redden
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
asked
sylvia
with
wonted
frankness
when
her
friend
drew
near
let
us
go
to
the
up
there
on
the
roof
sidwell
often
found
a
retreat
when
her
thoughts
were
troublesome
fitfully
she
had
resumed
her
drawing
but
as
a
rule
her
withdrawal
to
the
was
for
reading
or
reverie
carrying
a
small
lamp
she
led
the
way
before
sylvia
and
they
sat
down
in
the
chairs
which
on
one
occasion
had
been
occupied
by
buckland
warricombe
and
peak
the
wind
rarely
silent
in
this
part
of
devon
blew
boisterously
from
the
a
whistle
that
of
a
train
speeding
up
the
valley
on
its
way
from
plymouth
heightened
the
sense
of
retirement
and
quietude
always
to
be
enjoyed
at
night
here
under
the
stars
you
been
thinking
over
my
suggestion
asked
sylvia
when
there
had
been
silence
awhile
was
the
murmured
reply
has
happened
i
think
i
should
like
to
tell
you
sylvia
but
tell
you
i
ca
keep
it
in
my
own
mind
and
you
are
the
only
one
sylvia
was
surprised
at
the
agitation
which
suddenly
revealed
itself
in
her
companion
look
and
voice
she
became
serious
her
eyes
brightening
with
intellectual
curiosity
feminine
expressions
of
sympathy
were
not
to
be
expected
from
miss
moorhouse
far
more
reassuring
to
sidwell
was
the
kind
attentiveness
with
which
her
friend
bent
forward
letter
father
handed
me
was
from
mr
peak
hear
from
him
is
the
third
time
since
he
went
away
at
our
last
meeting
her
voice
dropped
pledged
my
faith
to
not
absolutely
the
future
was
too
uncertain
the
gleam
in
sylvia
eyes
grew
more
vivid
she
was
profoundly
interested
and
did
not
speak
when
sidwell
voice
failed
never
suspected
this
asked
the
latter
in
a
few
moments
exactly
that
what
i
did
suspect
was
that
mr
peak
departure
resulted
from
your
rejection
of
him
is
more
to
be
told
pursued
sidwell
in
tremulous
accents
must
know
it
all
because
i
need
your
help
no
one
here
has
learnt
what
took
place
between
us
mr
peak
did
not
go
away
on
that
account
but
you
remember
being
puzzled
to
explain
his
orthodoxy
in
religion
she
paused
sylvia
gave
a
nod
signifying
much
never
believed
as
he
professed
went
on
sidwell
hurriedly
were
justified
in
doubting
him
he
concealed
the
truth
pretended
to
champion
the
old
faiths
for
an
instant
she
broke
off
then
hastened
through
a
description
of
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
about
peak
discovery
sylvia
could
not
restrain
a
smile
but
it
was
softened
by
the
sincere
kindliness
of
her
feeling
it
was
after
this
she
inquired
impartially
the
decisive
conversation
between
you
took
place
just
before
buckland
announcement
we
met
again
after
does
it
seem
incredible
to
you
that
i
should
have
let
the
second
meeting
end
as
it
did
think
i
understand
yes
i
know
you
well
enough
to
follow
it
i
can
even
guess
at
the
defence
he
was
able
to
urge
can
asked
sidwell
eagerly
see
a
possibility
of
his
defending
himself
should
conjecture
that
it
amounted
to
the
old
proverb
all
fair
in
love
and
war
and
putting
aside
a
few
moral
prejudices
one
can
easily
enough
absolve
the
fact
is
i
had
long
ago
surmised
that
his
motives
in
taking
to
such
a
career
had
more
reference
to
this
world
than
the
next
you
know
i
had
several
long
talks
with
him
i
told
you
how
he
interested
me
now
i
can
piece
together
my
conclusions
urged
sidwell
must
inevitably
regard
him
as
ignoble
as
guilty
of
base
deceit
i
must
hide
nothing
from
you
having
told
so
much
have
you
heard
from
anyone
about
his
early
life
mother
told
me
some
old
stories
sidwell
made
an
impatient
gesture
in
words
of
force
and
ardour
such
as
never
before
had
been
at
her
command
she
related
all
she
knew
of
godwin
history
prior
to
his
settling
at
exeter
and
depicted
the
mood
the
impulses
which
by
his
own
confession
had
led
to
that
strange
enterprise
only
by
long
exercise
of
an
impassioned
imagination
could
she
thus
thoroughly
have
identified
herself
with
a
life
so
remote
from
her
own
peak
pleading
for
himself
was
scarcely
more
impressive
in
listening
sylvia
understood
how
completely
sidwell
had
cast
off
the
beliefs
for
which
her
ordinary
conversation
seemed
still
to
betray
a
tenderness
know
the
speaker
concluded
he
can
not
in
that
first
hour
have
come
to
regard
me
with
a
feeling
strong
enough
to
determine
what
he
then
undertook
it
was
not
i
as
an
individual
but
all
of
us
here
and
the
world
we
represented
afterwards
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
felt
love
for
me
from
the
beginning
and
i
i
tried
to
believe
it
because
i
wished
it
true
for
his
sake
and
for
my
own
however
it
was
i
could
not
harden
my
heart
against
him
a
thousand
considerations
forbade
me
to
allow
him
further
hope
but
i
refused
to
listen
no
i
not
listen
i
said
i
would
remain
true
to
him
he
went
away
to
take
up
his
old
pursuits
and
if
possible
to
make
a
position
for
himself
it
was
to
be
our
secret
and
in
spite
of
everything
i
hoped
for
the
future
silence
followed
and
sidwell
seemed
to
lose
herself
in
distressful
thought
now
asked
her
friend
has
come
to
pass
you
know
that
miss
moxey
is
dead
have
heard
of
it
is
dead
and
has
left
mr
peak
a
his
letter
of
today
tells
me
this
and
at
the
same
time
he
claims
my
promise
their
eyes
met
sylvia
still
had
the
air
of
meditating
a
most
interesting
problem
impossible
to
decide
from
her
countenance
how
she
regarded
sidwell
position
why
in
the
world
she
asked
marcella
moxey
have
left
her
money
to
mr
peak
were
friends
was
the
quick
reply
knew
all
that
had
befallen
him
and
wished
to
smooth
his
path
sylvia
put
several
more
questions
and
to
all
of
them
sidwell
replied
with
a
peculiar
decision
as
though
bent
on
making
it
clear
that
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
this
fact
of
the
bequest
the
motive
which
impelled
her
was
obscure
even
to
her
own
mind
for
ever
since
receiving
the
letter
she
had
suffered
harassing
doubts
where
now
she
affected
to
have
none
knew
then
was
sylvia
last
inquiry
the
relations
between
you
and
mr
peak
am
not
sure
but
i
think
so
yes
i
think
she
must
have
known
mr
peak
himself
then
sidwell
was
agitated
i
think
so
but
what
does
that
matter
the
other
allowed
her
face
to
betray
perplexity
much
for
the
past
she
said
at
length
now
have
not
the
courage
to
do
what
i
wish
there
was
a
long
silence
your
wish
asked
sylvia
at
length
are
not
at
all
doubtful
for
one
whether
i
err
in
my
judgment
of
him
could
be
proved
only
by
time
but
i
know
that
if
i
were
free
if
i
stood
alone
she
broke
off
and
sighed
would
mean
i
suppose
said
the
other
rupture
with
your
family
would
not
abandon
me
but
i
should
darken
the
close
of
his
life
buckland
would
utterly
cast
me
off
mother
would
wish
to
do
you
see
i
can
not
think
and
act
simply
as
a
woman
as
a
human
being
i
am
bound
to
a
certain
sphere
of
life
the
fact
that
i
have
outgrown
it
counts
for
nothing
i
can
not
free
myself
without
injury
to
people
whom
i
love
to
act
as
i
wish
would
be
to
outrage
every
rule
and
prejudice
of
the
society
to
which
i
belong
you
yourself
you
know
how
you
would
regard
me
sylvia
replied
deliberately
am
seeing
you
in
a
new
light
sidwell
it
takes
a
little
time
to
reconstruct
my
conception
of
you
think
worse
of
me
than
you
did
better
nor
worse
but
differently
there
has
been
too
much
reserve
between
us
after
so
long
a
friendship
i
ought
to
have
known
you
more
thoroughly
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
thought
now
and
then
of
you
and
mr
peak
that
was
inevitable
but
i
went
astray
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
unlikely
thing
that
you
should
regard
him
with
more
than
a
doubtful
interest
i
knew
of
course
that
he
had
made
you
his
ideal
and
i
felt
sorry
for
him
seemed
to
you
unworthy
placid
too
calmly
in
plain
words
sidwell
i
do
think
better
of
you
sidwell
smiled
to
know
me
henceforth
as
the
woman
who
did
not
dare
to
act
upon
her
best
impulses
for
best
i
ca
say
i
do
glorify
passion
as
you
know
and
on
the
other
hand
i
have
little
sympathy
with
the
people
who
are
always
crying
out
for
i
do
know
whether
it
would
be
best
to
throw
over
your
family
or
to
direct
yourself
solely
with
regard
to
their
comfort
sidwell
broke
in
that
is
the
true
phrase
their
comfort
no
higher
word
should
be
used
that
is
the
ideal
of
the
life
to
which
i
have
been
brought
up
comfort
and
has
no
right
if
i
sacrifice
myself
to
father
and
mother
do
i
not
sacrifice
as
well
he
has
forfeited
all
claim
to
consideration
that
is
what
people
say
with
my
whole
soul
i
deny
it
if
he
sinned
against
anyone
it
was
against
me
and
the
sin
ended
as
soon
as
i
understood
him
that
episode
in
his
life
is
blotted
out
by
what
law
must
it
condemn
to
imperfection
the
whole
of
his
life
and
of
my
own
yet
because
people
will
not
can
not
look
at
a
thing
in
a
spirit
of
justice
i
must
wrong
myself
and
him
us
think
of
it
more
quietly
said
sylvia
in
her
clear
dispassionate
tones
speak
as
though
a
decision
must
be
taken
at
once
where
is
the
necessity
for
that
mr
peak
is
now
independent
suppose
a
year
or
two
be
allowed
to
pass
may
not
things
look
differently
year
or
two
exclaimed
sidwell
with
impatience
will
be
changed
what
i
have
to
contend
against
is
unchangeable
if
i
guide
myself
by
such
a
hope
as
that
the
only
reasonable
thing
would
be
for
me
to
write
to
mr
peak
and
ask
him
to
wait
until
my
father
and
mother
are
dead
well
on
that
point
we
are
at
rest
then
the
step
must
be
taken
at
once
or
never
the
wind
roared
and
for
some
minutes
no
other
sound
was
audible
by
this
updater
note
the
word
time
missing
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
save
the
two
friends
were
in
bed
and
most
likely
sleeping
must
think
it
strange
said
sidwell
i
have
chosen
to
tell
you
all
this
just
when
the
confession
is
most
humiliating
to
me
i
want
to
feel
the
humiliation
as
one
only
can
when
another
is
witness
of
it
i
wish
to
leave
myself
no
excuse
for
the
future
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
you
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
break
with
him
i
am
a
coward
my
feeling
in
any
matter
were
as
strong
as
that
i
should
allow
it
to
guide
me
your
will
is
stronger
you
sylvia
would
never
in
my
position
have
granted
him
that
second
interview
you
would
have
known
that
all
was
at
an
end
and
have
acted
upon
the
knowledge
i
knew
it
but
yielded
to
temptation
at
expense
i
could
not
let
him
leave
me
though
that
would
have
been
kindest
i
held
him
by
a
promise
basely
conscious
that
retreat
was
always
open
to
me
and
now
i
shall
have
earned
his
contempt
her
voice
failed
sylvia
affected
by
the
outbreak
of
emotion
in
one
whom
she
had
always
known
so
strong
in
spoke
with
a
deeper
earnestness
do
you
wish
me
to
help
you
against
what
you
call
your
cowardice
i
can
not
take
it
upon
me
to
encourage
you
until
your
own
will
has
spoken
the
decision
must
come
from
yourself
choose
what
course
you
may
i
am
still
your
friend
i
have
no
idle
prejudices
and
no
social
bonds
you
know
how
i
wish
you
to
come
away
with
me
now
i
see
only
more
clearly
how
needful
it
is
for
you
to
breathe
new
air
yes
you
have
outgrown
these
conditions
just
as
your
brothers
have
just
as
fanny
will
indeed
has
take
to
think
of
it
if
you
can
decide
to
travel
with
me
for
a
year
be
frank
with
mr
peak
and
ask
him
to
wait
so
long
till
you
have
made
up
your
mind
he
can
not
reasonably
find
fault
with
you
for
he
knows
all
you
have
to
consider
wo
this
be
best
sidwell
was
long
silent
will
go
with
you
she
said
at
last
in
a
low
voice
will
ask
him
to
grant
me
perfect
liberty
for
a
year
when
she
came
down
next
morning
it
was
sidwell
intention
to
seek
a
private
interview
with
her
father
and
make
known
her
resolve
to
go
abroad
with
sylvia
but
warricombe
anticipated
her
you
come
to
the
library
after
breakfast
sidwell
he
said
on
meeting
her
in
the
hall
she
interpreted
his
tone
and
her
heart
misgave
her
an
hour
later
she
obeyed
the
summons
martin
greeted
her
with
a
smile
but
hardly
tried
to
appear
at
ease
am
obliged
to
speak
to
you
were
his
first
words
letter
you
had
yesterday
was
from
mr
peak
father
he
warricombe
hesitated
these
parts
again
in
lancashire
i
claim
no
right
whatever
to
control
your
correspondence
but
it
was
a
shock
to
me
to
find
that
you
are
in
communication
with
him
wrote
sidwell
replied
with
difficulty
let
me
know
of
a
change
that
has
come
upon
his
prospects
by
the
death
of
a
friend
he
is
made
independent
his
own
sake
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
but
how
could
it
concern
dear
she
struggled
to
command
herself
was
at
my
invitation
that
he
wrote
father
martin
face
expressed
grave
concern
is
this
right
she
was
very
pale
and
kept
her
eyes
unmovingly
directed
just
aside
from
her
father
can
it
mean
warricombe
pursued
with
sad
remonstrance
you
not
take
me
into
your
confidence
sidwell
ca
speak
of
it
she
replied
with
sudden
determination
of
all
with
you
father
of
all
i
thought
we
were
very
near
to
each
other
that
very
reason
i
ca
speak
to
you
of
this
i
must
be
left
free
i
am
going
away
with
sylvia
for
a
year
and
for
so
long
i
be
absolutely
independent
father
i
entreat
you
not
to
a
sob
checked
her
she
turned
away
and
fought
against
the
hysterical
tendency
but
it
was
too
strong
to
be
controlled
her
father
approached
beseeching
her
to
be
more
like
herself
he
held
her
in
his
arms
until
tears
had
their
free
course
and
a
measure
of
calmness
returned
ca
speak
to
you
about
it
she
repeated
her
face
hidden
from
him
must
write
you
a
long
letter
when
i
have
gone
you
shall
know
everything
in
that
way
my
dearest
i
ca
let
you
leave
us
under
these
circumstances
this
is
a
terrible
trial
to
me
you
can
not
possibly
go
until
we
understand
each
other
i
will
write
to
you
here
or
with
this
promise
martin
was
obliged
to
be
contented
sidwell
left
him
and
was
not
seen
except
by
sylvia
during
the
whole
day
nor
did
she
appear
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
that
followed
but
when
this
meal
was
over
sylvia
received
a
message
summoning
her
to
the
retreat
on
the
top
of
the
house
here
sidwell
sat
in
the
light
and
warmth
a
glass
door
wide
open
to
the
west
the
rays
of
a
brilliant
sun
softened
by
curtains
which
fluttered
lightly
in
the
breeze
from
the
sea
you
read
this
she
said
holding
out
a
sheet
of
notepaper
on
which
were
a
few
lines
in
her
own
handwriting
it
was
a
letter
beginning
can
not
sylvia
perused
it
carefully
and
stood
in
thought
all
were
the
words
with
which
she
broke
silence
they
were
neither
reproachful
nor
regretful
but
expressed
grave
interest
the
night
said
sidwell
wrote
to
father
but
i
shall
not
give
him
the
letter
before
it
was
finished
i
knew
that
i
must
write
there
no
more
to
be
said
dear
you
will
go
abroad
without
me
at
all
events
for
the
present
that
is
your
resolve
answered
the
other
quietly
shall
keep
my
word
and
only
do
what
i
can
to
aid
it
she
sat
down
shielding
her
eyes
from
the
sunlight
with
a
japanese
fan
all
sidwell
there
much
to
be
said
for
a
purpose
formed
on
such
a
morning
as
this
one
ca
help
distrusting
the
midnight
sidwell
was
lying
back
in
a
low
chair
her
eyes
turned
to
the
woody
hills
on
the
far
side
of
the
exe
one
thing
i
should
like
to
say
her
friend
pursued
struck
me
as
curious
that
you
were
not
at
all
affected
by
what
to
me
would
have
been
the
one
insuperable
difficulty
know
what
you
mean
the
legacy
it
still
seems
to
you
of
no
significance
very
little
sidwell
answered
wearily
letting
her
eyelids
droop
we
wo
talk
about
it
from
the
higher
point
of
view
i
believe
you
are
right
but
still
let
it
rest
in
the
afternoon
sidwell
penned
the
following
lines
which
she
enclosed
in
an
envelope
and
placed
on
the
study
table
when
her
father
was
absent
long
letter
which
i
promised
you
dear
father
is
needless
i
have
sent
mr
peak
a
reply
which
closes
our
correspondence
i
am
sure
he
will
not
write
again
if
he
were
to
do
so
i
should
not
answer
have
given
up
my
intention
of
going
away
with
sylvia
later
perhaps
i
shall
wish
to
join
her
somewhere
on
the
continent
but
by
that
time
you
will
be
in
no
concern
about
me
to
this
warricombe
replied
only
with
the
joyous
smile
which
greeted
his
daughter
at
their
next
meeting
warricombe
remained
in
ignorance
of
the
ominous
shadow
which
had
passed
over
her
house
at
present
she
was
greatly
interested
in
the
coming
marriage
of
the
rev
bruno
chilvers
whom
she
tried
to
forgive
for
having
disappointed
her
secret
hope
martin
had
finally
driven
into
the
background
those
uneasy
questionings
which
at
one
time
it
seemed
likely
that
godwin
peak
would
rather
accentuate
than
silence
with
sidwell
he
could
never
again
touch
on
such
topics
if
he
were
still
conscious
of
a
postponed
debate
the
adjournment
was
martin
rested
in
the
faith
that
without
effort
of
his
own
the
mysteries
of
life
and
time
would
ere
long
be
revealed
to
him
chapter
iii
earwaker
spent
christmas
with
his
relatives
at
kingsmill
his
father
and
mother
both
lived
the
latter
very
infirm
unable
to
leave
the
house
the
former
a
man
of
seventy
twisted
with
rheumatism
his
face
rugged
as
a
countenance
picked
out
by
fancy
on
the
trunk
of
a
big
old
oak
his
hands
scarred
and
deformed
with
labour
their
old
age
was
restful
the
son
who
had
made
himself
a
and
who
in
london
sat
at
the
tables
of
the
the
wealthy
the
famous
saw
to
it
that
they
lacked
no
comfort
a
bright
dry
morning
invited
the
old
man
and
the
young
to
go
forth
together
they
walked
from
the
suburb
countrywards
and
their
conversation
was
of
the
time
when
a
struggle
was
being
made
to
bear
the
expense
of
those
three
years
at
whitelaw
no
bad
investment
as
it
proved
the
father
spoke
with
a
strong
midland
accent
using
words
of
dialect
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
the
son
ear
for
dialect
is
a
very
different
thing
from
the
bestial
jargon
which
on
the
lips
of
the
london
vulgar
passes
for
english
they
were
laughing
over
some
half
grim
reminiscence
when
earwaker
became
aware
of
two
people
who
were
approaching
along
the
pavement
they
also
in
merry
talk
one
of
them
he
knew
it
was
christian
moxey
too
much
interested
in
his
companion
to
gaze
about
him
christian
came
quite
near
before
his
eyes
fell
on
earwaker
then
he
started
with
a
pleasant
surprise
changed
instantly
to
something
like
embarrassment
when
he
observed
the
aged
man
earwaker
was
willing
to
smile
and
go
by
had
the
other
consented
but
a
better
impulse
prevailed
in
both
they
stopped
and
struck
hands
together
father
said
the
man
of
letters
quite
at
his
ease
christian
was
equal
to
the
occasion
he
shook
hands
heartily
with
the
battered
toiler
then
turned
to
the
lady
at
his
side
you
guess
who
this
my
cousin
earwaker
miss
janet
moxey
doubtless
janet
was
aware
that
her
praises
had
suffered
no
diminution
when
sung
by
christian
to
his
friends
her
eyes
just
fell
but
in
a
moment
were
ready
with
their
frank
intelligent
smile
earwaker
experienced
a
pang
ever
so
slight
suggesting
a
revision
of
his
philosophy
they
talked
genially
and
parted
with
good
wishes
for
the
new
year
two
days
later
on
reaching
home
earwaker
found
in
his
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
were
scribbled
a
few
barely
legible
lines
i
am
he
at
length
deciphered
into
tilbury
at
eleven
this
morning
where
the
devil
are
you
write
to
charing
cross
hotel
no
signature
but
none
was
needed
malkin
return
from
new
zealand
had
been
signalled
in
advance
that
evening
the
erratic
gentleman
burst
in
like
a
whirlwind
he
was
the
picture
of
health
though
as
far
as
ever
from
enduing
the
comfortable
flesh
which
accompanies
robustness
in
men
of
calmer
temperament
after
violent
greetings
he
sat
down
with
abrupt
gravity
and
began
to
talk
as
if
in
continuance
of
a
dialogue
just
interrupted
do
let
us
have
any
misunderstanding
you
will
please
remember
that
my
journey
to
england
is
quite
independent
of
what
took
place
two
years
and
a
half
ago
it
has
to
do
with
those
circumstances
earwaker
smiled
tell
you
pursued
the
other
hotly
i
am
here
to
see
and
one
or
two
other
old
friends
and
to
look
after
some
business
matters
you
will
oblige
me
by
giving
credit
to
my
assertion
get
angry
i
am
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
you
say
well
it
as
likely
as
not
that
on
returning
to
auckland
i
shall
marry
miss
maccabe
of
whom
i
have
written
to
you
i
repeat
the
substance
of
my
letters
i
am
not
in
love
with
her
you
understand
and
i
need
say
that
my
intercourse
with
that
family
has
been
guided
by
extreme
discretion
but
she
is
a
very
sensible
young
lady
my
only
regret
is
that
i
did
know
her
years
ago
so
that
i
could
have
directed
her
education
she
might
have
been
even
more
interesting
than
she
is
but
you
are
at
leisure
i
hope
earwaker
an
hour
or
two
confound
it
when
a
friend
comes
back
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
yes
yes
i
understand
you
are
a
busy
man
forgive
my
hastiness
well
now
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
shall
probably
call
upon
mrs
jacox
he
paused
and
gave
the
listener
a
stern
look
forbidding
misconstruction
i
shall
probably
go
down
to
wrotham
i
wish
to
put
my
relations
with
that
family
on
a
proper
footing
our
correspondence
has
been
very
satisfactory
especially
of
late
the
poor
woman
laments
more
sincerely
her
well
let
us
say
her
folly
of
two
years
and
a
half
ago
she
has
outlived
it
she
regards
me
as
a
friend
bella
and
lily
seem
to
be
getting
on
very
well
indeed
that
governess
of
theirs
we
wo
have
any
more
mystery
it
was
i
who
undertook
the
trifling
expense
a
really
excellent
teacher
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
i
am
told
that
bella
promises
to
be
a
remarkable
pianist
and
lily
is
uncommonly
strong
in
languages
but
my
interest
in
them
is
merely
that
of
a
friend
let
it
be
understood
you
did
say
whether
the
girls
have
been
writing
to
you
no
no
not
a
line
i
have
exchanged
letters
only
with
their
mother
anything
else
would
have
been
indiscreet
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
them
but
my
old
schemes
are
things
of
the
past
there
is
not
the
faintest
probability
that
bella
has
retained
any
recollection
of
me
at
all
daresay
not
assented
earwaker
think
so
very
well
i
have
acted
wisely
bella
is
still
a
child
you
know
compared
with
a
man
of
my
age
she
is
seventeen
and
a
few
months
quite
a
child
miss
maccabe
is
just
the
proper
age
when
we
are
married
i
think
i
shall
bring
her
to
europe
for
a
year
or
two
her
education
needs
that
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
the
old
countries
you
her
portrait
no
things
have
got
so
far
as
that
what
a
hasty
fellow
you
are
earwaker
i
told
you
distinctly
he
talked
till
after
midnight
and
at
apologised
profusely
for
wasting
his
friend
valuable
time
earwaker
awaited
with
some
apprehension
the
result
of
malkin
visit
to
wrotham
but
the
report
of
what
took
place
on
that
occasion
was
surprisingly
commonplace
weeks
passed
and
malkin
seldom
showed
himself
at
staple
inn
when
he
did
so
his
talk
was
exclusively
of
miss
maccabe
all
he
could
be
got
to
say
of
the
young
ladies
at
wrotham
was
girls
very
nice
girls
i
hope
they
marry
well
two
months
had
gone
by
and
already
the
journalist
had
heard
by
letter
of
his
friend
intention
to
return
to
new
zealand
when
on
coming
home
late
one
night
he
found
malkin
sitting
on
the
steps
i
have
something
very
serious
to
tell
you
give
me
just
a
quarter
of
an
hour
what
calamity
did
this
tone
portend
the
eccentric
man
seated
himself
with
slow
movement
seen
by
a
good
light
his
face
was
not
gloomy
but
very
grave
to
me
old
friend
he
began
sliding
forward
to
the
edge
of
his
chair
remember
i
told
you
that
my
relations
with
the
maccabe
family
had
been
marked
throughout
with
extreme
discretion
impressed
that
upon
me
i
have
never
made
love
to
miss
maccabe
and
i
doubt
whether
she
has
ever
thought
of
me
as
a
possible
husband
be
impatient
i
want
you
to
grasp
the
fact
it
is
important
because
i
am
going
to
marry
bella
jacox
do
say
so
not
cried
malkin
suddenly
passing
to
a
state
of
excitement
objection
can
you
make
i
tell
you
that
i
am
absolutely
free
to
choose
the
journalist
calmed
him
and
thereupon
had
to
hear
a
glowing
account
of
bella
perfections
all
the
feeling
that
malkin
had
suppressed
during
these
two
months
rushed
forth
in
a
flood
of
turbid
eloquence
now
he
concluded
will
come
down
with
me
to
wrotham
i
do
mean
let
us
say
the
day
after
tomorrow
sunday
you
remember
our
last
joint
visit
ha
ha
jacox
is
reconciled
dear
fellow
she
rejoices
a
wonderful
nobility
in
that
poor
little
woman
she
wept
upon
my
shoulder
but
you
must
see
bella
i
sha
take
her
to
new
zealand
at
all
events
not
just
yet
we
shall
travel
about
europe
completing
her
education
do
you
approve
of
that
on
sunday
the
two
travelled
down
into
kent
this
time
they
were
received
by
lily
now
a
pretty
pale
girl
of
fifteen
in
a
few
minutes
her
sister
entered
bella
was
charming
nervousness
made
her
words
few
and
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
naturally
thoughtful
earnest
prone
to
reverie
her
beauty
had
still
to
ripen
and
gave
much
promise
for
the
years
between
twenty
and
thirty
last
of
all
appeared
jacox
who
blushed
as
she
shook
hands
with
earwaker
and
for
a
time
was
ill
at
ease
but
her
vocatives
were
not
long
restrained
and
when
all
sat
down
to
the
she
chattered
away
with
astonishing
vivacity
after
tea
the
company
was
joined
by
a
lady
of
middle
age
who
for
about
two
years
had
acted
as
governess
to
the
girls
earwaker
formed
his
conclusions
as
to
the
which
her
services
represented
but
it
was
probably
a
real
interest
in
her
pupils
which
had
induced
a
person
of
so
much
refinement
to
bear
so
long
with
the
proximity
of
jacox
natural
question
occurs
to
me
remarked
earwaker
as
they
were
returning
and
what
was
mr
jacox
bella
was
talking
to
me
about
him
the
other
day
he
must
have
been
distinctly
an
interesting
man
bella
had
a
very
clear
recollection
of
him
and
she
showed
me
two
or
three
photographs
engaged
in
some
kind
of
commerce
i
did
seek
particulars
but
a
remarkable
man
one
doubt
he
resumed
presently
do
suppose
that
this
marriage
entirely
satisfies
me
bella
has
been
fairly
well
taught
but
not
you
see
under
my
supervision
i
ought
to
have
been
able
to
watch
and
direct
her
month
by
month
as
it
is
i
shall
have
to
begin
by
assailing
her
views
on
all
manner
of
things
religion
for
example
well
i
have
no
religion
that
plain
i
might
call
myself
this
or
that
for
the
sake
of
seeming
respectable
but
it
all
comes
to
the
same
thing
i
do
mind
bella
going
to
church
if
she
wishes
but
i
must
teach
her
that
there
no
merit
whatever
in
doing
so
it
is
an
ideal
marriage
but
perhaps
as
good
as
this
imperfect
world
allows
if
i
have
children
i
can
then
put
my
educational
theories
to
the
test
by
way
of
novel
experience
earwaker
not
long
after
this
converted
his
study
into
a
and
invited
the
jacox
family
to
taste
his
tea
and
cake
with
malkin
assistance
the
risky
enterprise
was
made
a
great
success
when
jacox
would
allow
her
to
be
heard
bella
talked
intelligently
and
showed
eager
interest
in
the
details
of
literary
manufacture
mr
earwaker
cried
her
mother
when
it
was
time
to
go
a
delightful
afternoon
you
have
given
us
we
must
think
of
you
from
now
as
one
of
our
very
best
friends
must
we
lily
but
troubles
were
yet
in
store
malkin
was
strongly
opposed
to
a
religious
marriage
he
wished
the
wedding
to
be
at
a
office
and
had
obtained
bella
consent
to
this
but
jacox
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
she
wept
and
bewailed
herself
you
think
of
being
married
like
a
costermonger
o
malkin
you
will
break
my
heart
indeed
you
will
and
she
wrote
an
ejaculatory
letter
to
earwaker
imploring
his
intercession
the
journalist
took
his
friend
in
hand
good
fellow
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
women
are
born
for
one
thing
only
the
church
of
england
marriage
service
how
can
you
seek
to
defeat
the
end
of
their
existence
give
in
to
the
inevitable
grin
and
bear
it
ca
i
wo
it
shall
be
a
runaway
match
i
had
rather
suffer
the
rack
than
go
through
an
ordinary
wedding
dire
was
the
conflict
down
at
wrotham
there
were
floods
of
tears
in
the
end
bella
effected
a
compromise
the
marriage
was
to
be
at
a
church
but
in
the
greatest
possible
privacy
no
carriages
no
gala
dresses
no
invitations
no
wedding
feast
the
bare
indispensable
formalities
and
so
it
came
to
pass
earwaker
and
the
girl
governess
were
the
only
strangers
present
when
on
a
morning
of
june
malkin
and
bella
were
declared
by
the
church
to
be
henceforth
one
and
indivisible
the
bride
wore
a
graceful
travelling
costume
the
bridegroom
was
in
corresponding
attire
be
thanked
that
over
exclaimed
malkin
as
he
issued
from
the
portal
we
have
minutes
to
get
to
the
railway
station
do
cry
he
whispered
to
her
ca
stand
that
no
do
be
afraid
she
whispered
back
have
said
already
that
was
very
thoughtful
of
goodbye
all
shall
write
from
paris
earwaker
nineteen
minutes
we
shall
just
manage
it
he
sprang
into
the
cab
and
away
it
clattered
a
letter
from
paris
a
letter
from
strasburg
from
berlin
munich
letters
about
once
a
fortnight
from
bella
also
came
an
occasional
note
a
pretty
contrast
to
the
incoherent
enthusiasm
of
her
husband
compositions
midway
in
september
she
announced
their
departure
from
a
retreat
in
switzerland
are
in
the
utmost
excitement
for
it
is
now
decided
that
in
three
days
we
start
for
italy
the
heat
has
been
terrific
and
we
have
waited
on
what
seems
to
me
the
threshold
of
paradise
until
we
could
hope
to
enjoy
the
delights
beyond
we
go
first
to
milan
my
husband
of
course
knows
italy
but
he
shares
my
impatience
i
am
to
entreat
you
to
write
to
milan
with
as
much
news
as
possible
especially
have
you
heard
anything
more
of
mr
peak
november
the
pair
spent
in
rome
and
thence
was
despatched
the
following
in
malkin
hand
time
i
am
mistaken
i
have
seen
peak
he
did
see
me
perhaps
would
have
known
me
it
was
in
piale
i
had
sat
down
to
when
a
voice
behind
me
sounded
in
such
a
curiously
reminding
way
that
i
could
help
looking
round
it
was
peak
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
might
have
been
uncertain
about
his
face
but
the
voice
brought
back
that
conversation
at
your
rooms
too
unmistakably
long
ago
as
it
was
he
was
talking
to
an
american
whom
evidently
he
had
met
somewhere
else
and
had
now
recognised
i
had
a
fever
he
said
and
ca
quite
shake
off
the
results
been
in
ischia
for
the
last
month
i
going
north
to
vienna
then
the
two
walked
away
together
he
looked
ill
sallow
worn
out
let
me
know
if
you
hear
on
that
same
day
earwaker
received
another
letter
with
the
roman
it
was
from
peak
have
had
nothing
particular
to
tell
you
a
month
ago
i
thought
i
should
never
write
to
you
again
i
got
malarial
fever
and
lay
desperately
ill
at
the
at
naples
it
came
of
some
monstrous
follies
there
no
need
to
speak
of
a
new
and
valuable
experience
i
know
what
it
is
to
look
steadily
into
the
eyes
of
death
now
i
am
far
from
well
this
keeps
me
in
low
spirits
the
other
day
i
was
half
decided
to
start
for
london
i
am
miserably
alone
want
to
see
a
friend
what
a
glorious
place
staple
inn
seemed
to
me
as
i
lay
in
the
hospital
proof
how
low
i
had
sunk
i
thought
longingly
of
exeter
of
a
certain
house
there
never
mind
write
hastily
an
invitation
from
some
musical
people
has
decided
me
to
strike
for
vienna
up
there
i
shall
get
my
health
back
the
people
are
of
no
account
acquaintances
but
they
may
lead
to
better
i
never
in
my
life
suffered
so
from
loneliness
this
was
the
eighteenth
of
november
on
the
the
postman
delivered
a
letter
of
an
appearance
which
puzzled
earwaker
the
stamp
was
austrian
the
mark
from
peak
therefore
but
the
writing
was
unknown
plainly
that
of
a
foreigner
the
envelope
contained
two
sheets
of
paper
the
one
was
covered
with
a
long
communication
in
german
on
the
other
stood
a
few
words
of
english
written
or
rather
scrawled
in
a
hand
there
was
no
recognising
again
and
alone
if
i
die
act
for
me
write
to
mrs
peak
twybridge
beneath
was
added
earwaker
staple
inn
london
he
turned
hurriedly
to
the
foreign
writing
earwaker
read
a
german
book
as
easily
as
an
english
but
german
manuscript
was
a
terror
to
him
and
the
present
correspondent
wrote
so
execrably
that
beyond
scarcely
a
word
yielded
sense
to
his
anxious
eyes
ha
one
he
had
made
out
crumpling
the
papers
into
his
pocket
he
hastened
out
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
an
acquaintance
in
another
part
of
the
inn
this
was
a
man
who
had
probably
more
skill
in
german
cursive
between
them
they
extracted
the
essence
of
the
letter
he
who
wrote
was
the
landlord
of
an
hotel
in
vienna
he
reported
that
an
english
gentleman
named
peak
just
arrived
from
italy
had
taken
a
bedroom
at
that
house
in
the
night
the
stranger
became
very
ill
sent
for
a
doctor
and
wrote
the
lines
enclosed
the
purport
whereof
he
at
the
same
time
explained
to
his
attendants
on
the
second
day
mr
peak
died
among
his
effects
were
found
circular
notes
and
a
sum
of
loose
money
the
body
was
about
to
be
interred
probably
earwaker
would
receive
official
communications
as
the
british
consul
had
been
informed
of
the
matter
to
whom
should
be
sent
the
man
of
letters
walked
slowly
back
to
his
own
abode
too
in
exile
was
his
thought
old
fellow
