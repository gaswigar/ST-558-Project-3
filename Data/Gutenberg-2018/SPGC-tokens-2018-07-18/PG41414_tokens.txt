ix
the
story
of
a
story
the
girl
from
the
marsh
croft
i
it
took
place
in
the
court
room
of
a
rural
district
at
the
head
of
the
judges
table
sits
an
old
judge
a
tall
and
massively
built
man
with
a
broad
visage
for
several
hours
he
has
been
engaged
in
deciding
one
case
after
another
and
finally
something
like
disgust
and
melancholy
has
taken
hold
of
him
it
is
difficult
to
know
if
it
is
the
heat
and
closeness
of
the
court
room
that
are
torturing
him
or
if
he
has
become
from
handling
all
these
petty
wrangles
which
seem
to
spring
from
no
other
cause
than
to
bear
witness
to
uncharitableness
and
greed
he
has
just
begun
on
one
of
the
last
cases
to
be
tried
during
the
day
it
concerns
a
plea
for
help
in
the
rearing
of
a
child
this
case
had
already
been
tried
at
the
last
court
session
and
the
protocols
of
the
former
suit
are
being
read
therefore
one
learns
that
the
plaintiff
is
a
poor
farmer
daughter
and
the
defendant
is
a
married
man
moreover
it
says
in
the
protocol
the
defendant
maintains
that
the
plaintiff
has
wrongfully
unjustly
and
only
with
the
desire
of
profiting
thereby
sued
the
defendant
he
admits
that
at
one
time
the
plaintiff
had
been
employed
in
his
household
but
that
during
her
stay
in
his
home
he
had
not
carried
on
any
intrigue
with
her
and
she
has
no
right
to
demand
assistance
from
him
the
plaintiff
still
holds
firmly
to
her
claim
and
after
a
few
witnesses
have
been
heard
the
defendant
is
called
to
take
the
oath
and
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
sentenced
by
the
court
to
assist
the
plaintiff
both
parties
have
come
up
and
are
standing
side
by
side
before
the
judges
table
the
plaintiff
is
very
young
and
looks
frightened
to
death
she
is
weeping
from
shyness
and
with
difficulty
wipes
away
the
tears
with
a
crumpled
handkerchief
which
she
does
seem
to
know
how
to
open
out
she
wears
black
clothes
which
are
quite
new
and
whole
but
they
fit
so
badly
that
one
is
tempted
to
think
she
has
borrowed
them
in
order
to
appear
before
the
court
of
justice
in
a
befitting
manner
as
regards
the
defendant
one
sees
at
a
glance
that
he
is
a
prosperous
man
he
is
about
forty
and
has
a
bold
and
dashing
appearance
as
he
stands
before
the
court
he
has
a
very
good
bearing
one
can
see
that
he
does
not
think
it
a
pleasure
to
stand
there
but
he
does
appear
to
be
the
least
concerned
about
it
as
soon
as
the
protocols
have
been
read
the
judge
turns
to
the
defendant
and
asks
him
if
he
holds
fast
to
his
denials
and
if
he
is
prepared
to
take
the
oath
to
these
questions
the
defendant
promptly
answers
a
curt
yes
he
digs
down
in
his
vest
pocket
and
takes
out
a
statement
from
the
clergyman
who
attests
that
he
understands
the
meaning
and
import
of
the
oath
and
is
qualified
to
take
it
all
through
this
the
plaintiff
has
been
weeping
she
appears
to
be
unconquerably
bashful
and
doggedly
keeps
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
thus
far
she
has
not
raised
her
eyes
sufficiently
to
look
the
defendant
in
the
face
as
he
utters
his
yes
she
starts
back
she
moves
a
step
or
two
nearer
the
court
as
if
she
had
something
to
say
to
the
contrary
and
then
she
stands
there
perplexed
it
is
hardly
possible
she
seems
to
say
to
herself
he
can
not
have
answered
yes
i
have
heard
wrongly
meanwhile
the
judge
takes
the
clergyman
paper
and
motions
to
the
court
officer
the
latter
goes
up
to
the
table
to
find
the
bible
which
lies
hidden
under
a
pile
of
records
and
lays
it
down
in
front
of
the
defendant
the
plaintiff
hears
that
some
one
is
walking
past
her
and
becomes
restless
she
forces
herself
to
raise
her
eyes
just
enough
to
cast
a
glance
over
the
table
and
she
sees
then
how
the
court
officer
moves
the
bible
again
it
appears
as
though
she
wished
to
raise
some
objection
and
again
she
controls
herself
it
is
possible
that
he
will
be
allowed
to
take
the
oath
surely
the
judge
must
prevent
him
the
judge
is
a
wise
man
and
knows
how
people
in
her
home
district
think
and
feel
he
knew
very
likely
how
severe
all
people
were
as
soon
as
there
was
anything
which
affected
the
marriage
relation
they
knew
of
no
worse
sin
than
the
one
she
had
committed
would
she
ever
have
confessed
anything
like
this
about
herself
if
it
were
not
true
the
judge
must
understand
the
awful
contempt
that
she
had
brought
down
upon
herself
and
not
contempt
only
but
all
sorts
of
misery
no
one
wanted
her
in
service
no
one
wanted
her
work
her
own
parents
could
scarcely
tolerate
her
presence
in
their
cabin
and
talked
all
the
while
of
casting
her
out
oh
the
judge
must
know
that
she
would
never
have
asked
for
help
from
a
married
man
had
she
no
right
to
it
surely
the
judge
could
not
believe
that
she
lied
in
a
case
like
this
that
she
would
have
called
down
upon
herself
such
a
terrible
misfortune
if
she
had
had
any
one
else
to
accuse
than
a
married
man
and
if
he
knows
this
he
must
stop
the
she
sees
that
the
judge
reads
through
the
clergyman
statements
a
couple
of
times
and
she
begins
to
think
he
intends
to
interfere
true
the
judge
has
a
wary
look
now
he
shifts
his
glance
to
the
plaintiff
and
with
that
his
weariness
and
disgust
become
even
more
marked
it
appears
as
though
he
were
unfavorably
disposed
toward
her
even
if
the
plaintiff
is
telling
the
truth
she
is
nevertheless
a
bad
woman
and
the
judge
can
not
feel
any
sympathy
for
her
sometimes
the
judge
interposes
in
a
case
like
a
good
and
wise
counsellor
and
keeps
the
parties
from
ruining
themselves
entirely
but
he
is
tired
and
cross
and
thinks
only
of
letting
the
legal
process
have
its
course
he
lays
down
the
clergyman
recommendation
and
says
a
few
words
to
the
defendant
to
the
effect
that
he
hopes
he
has
carefully
considered
the
consequences
of
a
perjured
oath
the
defendant
listens
to
him
with
the
calm
air
which
he
has
shown
all
the
while
and
he
answers
respectfully
and
not
without
dignity
the
plaintiff
listens
to
this
in
extreme
terror
she
makes
a
few
vehement
protests
and
wrings
her
hands
now
she
wants
to
speak
to
the
court
she
struggles
frightfully
with
her
shyness
and
with
the
sobs
which
prevent
her
speaking
the
result
is
that
she
can
not
get
out
an
audible
word
then
the
oath
will
be
taken
she
must
give
it
up
no
one
will
prevent
him
from
swearing
away
his
soul
until
now
she
could
not
believe
this
possible
but
now
she
is
seized
with
the
certainty
that
it
is
close
at
hand
that
it
will
occur
the
next
second
a
fear
more
overpowering
than
any
she
has
hitherto
felt
takes
possession
of
her
she
is
absolutely
paralyzed
she
does
not
even
weep
more
her
eyes
are
glazed
it
is
his
intention
then
to
bring
down
upon
himself
eternal
punishment
she
comprehends
that
he
wants
to
swear
himself
free
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
but
even
if
the
truth
were
to
make
trouble
in
his
home
he
should
not
for
that
reason
throw
away
his
soul
salvation
there
is
nothing
so
terrible
as
perjury
there
is
something
uncanny
and
awful
about
that
sin
there
is
no
mercy
or
condonation
for
it
the
gates
of
the
infernal
regions
open
of
their
own
accord
when
the
name
is
mentioned
if
she
had
then
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
she
would
have
been
afraid
of
seeing
it
stamped
with
damnation
mark
branded
by
the
wrath
of
god
as
she
stands
there
and
works
herself
into
greater
and
greater
terror
the
judge
instructs
the
defendant
as
to
how
he
must
place
his
fingers
on
the
bible
then
the
judge
opens
the
law
book
to
find
the
form
of
the
oath
as
she
sees
him
place
his
fingers
on
the
book
she
comes
a
step
nearer
and
it
appears
as
though
she
wished
to
reach
across
the
table
and
push
his
hand
away
but
as
yet
she
is
restrained
by
a
faint
hope
she
thinks
he
will
relent
now
at
the
last
moment
the
judge
has
found
the
place
in
the
law
book
and
now
he
begins
to
administer
the
oath
loudly
and
distinctly
then
he
makes
a
pause
for
the
defendant
to
repeat
his
words
the
defendant
actually
starts
to
repeat
but
he
stumbles
over
the
words
and
the
judge
must
begin
again
from
the
beginning
now
she
can
no
longer
entertain
a
trace
of
hope
she
knows
now
that
he
means
to
swear
falsely
that
he
means
to
bring
down
upon
himself
the
wrath
of
god
both
for
this
life
and
for
the
life
to
come
she
stands
wringing
her
hands
in
her
helplessness
and
it
is
all
her
fault
because
she
has
accused
him
but
she
was
without
work
she
was
starving
and
freezing
the
child
came
near
dying
to
whom
else
should
she
turn
for
help
never
had
she
thought
that
he
would
be
willing
to
commit
such
an
execrable
sin
the
judge
has
again
administered
the
oath
in
a
few
seconds
the
thing
will
have
been
done
the
kind
of
thing
from
which
there
is
no
turning
back
which
can
never
be
retrieved
never
blotted
out
just
as
the
defendant
begins
to
repeat
the
oath
she
rushes
forward
sweeps
away
his
outstretched
hand
and
seizes
the
bible
it
is
her
terrible
dread
which
has
finally
given
her
courage
he
must
not
swear
away
his
soul
he
must
not
the
court
officer
hastens
forward
instantly
to
take
the
bible
from
her
and
to
bring
her
to
order
she
has
a
boundless
fear
of
all
that
pertains
to
a
court
of
justice
and
actually
believes
that
what
she
has
just
done
will
bring
her
to
prison
but
she
does
not
let
go
her
hold
on
the
bible
cost
what
it
may
he
can
not
take
the
oath
he
who
would
swear
also
runs
up
to
take
the
bible
but
she
resists
him
too
you
shall
not
take
the
oath
she
cries
you
shall
not
that
which
is
happening
naturally
awakens
the
greatest
surprise
the
court
attendants
elbow
their
way
up
to
the
bar
the
jurymen
start
to
rise
the
recording
clerk
jumps
up
with
the
ink
bottle
in
his
hand
to
prevent
its
being
upset
then
the
judge
shouts
in
a
loud
and
angry
tone
silence
and
everybody
stands
perfectly
still
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
business
have
you
with
the
bible
the
judge
asks
the
plaintiff
in
the
same
hard
and
severe
tone
since
with
the
courage
of
despair
she
has
been
able
to
give
utterance
to
her
distress
her
anxiety
has
decreased
so
that
she
can
answer
he
must
not
take
the
oath
be
silent
and
put
back
the
book
demands
the
judge
she
does
not
obey
but
holds
the
book
tightly
with
both
hands
he
can
not
take
the
oath
she
cries
fiercely
are
you
so
determined
to
win
your
suit
asks
the
judge
sharply
i
want
to
withdraw
the
suit
she
shrieks
in
a
high
shrill
voice
i
do
want
to
force
him
to
swear
what
are
you
shrieking
about
demands
the
judge
have
you
lost
your
senses
she
catches
her
breath
suddenly
and
tries
to
control
herself
she
hears
herself
how
she
is
shrieking
the
judge
will
think
she
has
gone
mad
if
she
can
not
say
what
she
would
say
calmly
she
struggles
with
herself
again
to
get
control
of
her
voice
and
this
time
she
succeeds
she
says
slowly
earnestly
and
clearly
as
she
looks
the
judge
in
the
face
i
wish
to
withdraw
the
suit
he
is
the
father
of
the
child
i
am
still
fond
of
him
i
do
wish
him
to
swear
falsely
she
stands
erect
and
resolute
facing
the
judges
table
all
the
while
looking
the
judge
square
in
the
face
he
sits
with
both
hands
resting
on
the
table
and
for
a
long
while
does
not
take
his
eyes
off
from
her
while
the
judge
is
looking
at
her
a
great
change
comes
over
him
all
the
ennui
and
displeasure
in
his
face
vanishes
and
the
large
visage
becomes
beautiful
with
the
most
beautiful
emotion
ah
see
he
thinks
ah
see
such
is
the
mettle
of
my
people
i
shall
not
be
vexed
at
them
when
there
is
so
much
love
and
godliness
even
in
one
of
the
humblest
suddenly
the
judge
feels
his
eyes
fill
up
with
tears
then
he
pulls
himself
together
almost
ashamed
and
casts
a
hasty
glance
about
him
he
sees
that
the
clerks
and
bailiffs
and
the
whole
long
row
of
jurymen
are
leaning
forward
and
looking
at
the
girl
who
stands
before
the
table
with
the
bible
hugged
close
to
her
and
he
sees
a
light
in
their
faces
as
though
they
had
seen
something
very
beautiful
which
had
made
them
happy
all
the
way
into
their
souls
then
the
judge
casts
a
glance
over
the
spectators
and
he
sees
that
they
all
breathe
a
quick
sigh
of
relief
as
if
they
had
just
heard
what
they
had
longed
above
everything
to
hear
finally
the
judge
looks
at
the
defendant
now
it
is
who
stands
with
lowered
head
and
looks
at
the
floor
the
judge
turns
once
more
to
the
poor
girl
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
he
says
the
case
shall
be
stricken
from
the
calendar
this
to
the
recording
clerk
the
defendant
makes
a
move
as
though
he
wished
to
interpose
an
objection
well
what
now
the
judge
bellows
at
him
have
you
anything
against
it
the
defendant
head
hangs
lower
and
lower
and
he
says
almost
inaudibly
oh
no
i
dare
say
it
is
best
to
let
it
go
that
way
the
judge
sits
still
a
moment
more
and
then
he
pushes
the
heavy
chair
back
rises
and
walks
around
the
table
and
up
to
the
plaintiff
thank
you
he
says
and
gives
her
his
hand
she
has
laid
down
the
bible
and
stands
wiping
away
the
tears
with
the
crumpled
up
handkerchief
thank
you
says
the
judge
once
more
taking
her
hand
and
shaking
it
as
if
it
belonged
to
a
real
man
man
ii
let
no
one
imagine
that
the
girl
who
had
passed
through
such
a
trying
ordeal
at
the
bar
of
justice
thought
that
she
had
done
anything
praiseworthy
on
the
contrary
she
considered
herself
disgraced
before
the
whole
court
room
she
did
not
understand
that
there
was
something
honorable
in
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
gone
over
and
shaken
hands
with
her
she
thought
it
simply
meant
that
the
trial
was
over
and
that
she
might
go
her
way
nor
did
she
observe
that
people
gave
her
kindly
glances
and
that
there
were
several
who
wanted
to
press
her
hand
she
stole
by
and
wanted
only
to
go
there
was
a
crush
at
the
door
the
court
was
over
and
many
in
their
hurry
to
get
out
made
a
rush
for
the
door
she
drew
aside
and
was
about
the
last
person
to
leave
the
court
room
because
she
felt
that
every
one
else
ought
to
go
before
her
when
she
finally
came
out
gudmund
erlandsson
cart
stood
in
waiting
at
the
door
gudmund
was
seated
in
the
cart
holding
the
reins
and
was
apparently
waiting
for
some
one
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
among
all
the
people
who
poured
out
of
the
court
room
he
called
to
her
come
here
helga
you
can
ride
with
me
since
we
are
going
in
the
same
direction
although
she
heard
her
name
she
could
not
believe
that
it
was
she
whom
he
was
calling
it
was
not
possible
that
gudmund
erlandsson
wanted
to
ride
with
her
he
was
the
most
attractive
man
in
the
whole
parish
young
and
handsome
and
of
good
family
connections
and
popular
with
every
one
she
could
not
imagine
that
he
wished
to
associate
with
her
she
was
walking
with
the
head
shawl
drawn
far
down
on
her
forehead
and
was
hastening
past
him
without
either
glancing
up
or
answering
do
you
hear
helga
that
you
can
ride
with
me
said
gudmund
and
there
was
a
friendly
note
in
his
voice
but
she
could
grasp
that
gudmund
meant
well
by
her
she
thought
that
in
one
way
or
another
he
wished
to
make
sport
of
her
and
was
only
waiting
for
those
who
stood
near
by
to
begin
tittering
and
laughing
she
cast
a
frightened
and
indignant
glance
at
him
and
almost
ran
from
the
court
house
grounds
to
be
out
of
earshot
when
the
laughter
should
start
in
gudmund
was
unmarried
at
that
time
and
lived
at
home
with
his
parents
his
father
was
a
his
was
not
a
large
farm
and
he
was
not
rich
but
he
made
a
good
living
the
son
had
gone
to
the
court
house
to
fetch
some
deeds
for
his
father
but
as
there
was
also
another
purpose
in
the
trip
he
had
groomed
himself
carefully
he
had
taken
the
trap
with
not
a
crack
in
the
lacquering
had
rubbed
up
the
harness
and
curried
the
horse
until
he
shone
like
satin
he
had
placed
a
bright
red
blanket
on
the
seat
beside
him
and
himself
he
had
adorned
with
a
short
a
small
gray
felt
hat
and
top
boots
into
which
the
trousers
were
tucked
this
was
no
holiday
attire
but
he
probably
knew
that
he
looked
handsome
and
manly
gudmund
was
seated
alone
in
the
cart
when
he
drove
from
home
in
the
morning
but
he
had
agreeable
things
to
think
of
and
the
time
had
not
seemed
long
to
him
when
he
had
arrived
about
he
came
across
a
poor
young
girl
who
was
walking
very
slowly
and
looked
as
though
she
were
scarcely
able
to
move
her
feet
because
of
exhaustion
it
was
autumn
and
the
road
was
and
gudmund
saw
how
with
every
step
she
sank
deeper
into
the
mud
he
stopped
and
asked
where
she
was
going
when
he
learned
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
court
house
he
invited
her
to
ride
she
thanked
him
and
stepped
up
on
the
back
of
the
cart
to
the
narrow
board
where
the
hay
sack
was
tied
as
though
she
dared
not
touch
the
red
blanket
beside
gudmund
nor
was
it
his
meaning
that
she
should
sit
beside
him
he
did
know
who
she
was
but
he
supposed
her
to
be
the
daughter
of
some
poor
backwoodsman
and
thought
the
rear
of
the
cart
was
quite
good
enough
for
her
when
they
came
to
a
steep
hill
and
the
horse
began
to
slow
up
gudmund
started
talking
he
wanted
to
know
her
name
and
where
she
was
from
when
he
learned
that
her
name
was
helga
and
that
she
came
from
a
backwoods
farm
called
big
marsh
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
have
you
always
lived
at
home
on
the
farm
or
have
you
been
out
to
service
he
asked
the
past
year
she
had
been
at
home
but
before
this
she
had
been
working
out
where
asked
gudmund
hastily
he
thought
it
was
a
long
while
before
the
answer
was
forthcoming
at
the
west
farm
with
per
mårtensson
she
said
finally
sinking
her
voice
as
if
she
would
rather
not
have
been
heard
but
gudmund
heard
her
indeed
then
it
is
you
who
said
he
but
did
not
conclude
his
meaning
he
turned
from
her
and
sat
up
straight
in
his
seat
and
said
not
another
word
to
her
gudmund
gave
the
horse
rap
upon
rap
and
talked
loudly
to
himself
about
the
wretched
condition
of
the
road
and
was
in
a
very
bad
humor
the
girl
sat
still
for
a
moment
presently
gudmund
felt
her
hand
upon
his
arm
what
do
you
wish
he
asked
without
turning
his
head
oh
he
was
to
stop
so
she
could
jump
out
why
so
sneered
gudmund
are
you
riding
comfortably
yes
thank
you
but
i
prefer
to
walk
gudmund
struggled
a
little
with
himself
it
was
provoking
that
he
should
have
bidden
a
person
of
helga
sort
to
ride
with
him
of
all
days
but
he
thought
also
that
since
he
had
taken
her
into
the
wagon
he
could
not
drive
her
out
stop
gudmund
said
the
girl
once
again
she
spoke
in
a
very
decided
tone
and
gudmund
drew
in
the
reins
it
is
she
of
course
who
wishes
to
step
down
thought
he
i
have
to
force
her
to
ride
against
her
will
she
was
down
on
the
road
before
the
horse
had
time
to
stop
i
thought
you
knew
who
i
was
when
you
asked
me
to
ride
she
said
or
i
should
not
have
stepped
into
the
cart
gudmund
muttered
a
short
and
drove
on
she
was
doubtless
right
in
thinking
that
he
knew
her
he
had
seen
the
girl
from
the
marsh
croft
many
times
as
a
child
but
she
had
changed
since
she
was
grown
up
at
first
he
was
very
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
travelling
companion
but
gradually
he
began
to
feel
displeased
with
himself
he
could
hardly
have
acted
differently
yet
he
did
not
like
being
cruel
to
any
one
shortly
after
gudmund
had
parted
from
helga
he
turned
out
of
the
road
and
up
a
narrow
street
and
came
to
a
large
and
fine
estate
as
gudmund
drew
up
before
the
gate
the
house
door
opened
and
one
of
the
daughters
appeared
gudmund
raised
his
hat
at
the
same
time
a
faint
flush
covered
his
face
wonder
if
the
juryman
is
at
home
said
he
no
father
has
gone
down
to
the
court
house
replied
the
daughter
oh
then
he
has
already
gone
said
gudmund
i
drove
over
to
ask
if
the
juryman
would
ride
with
me
i
going
to
the
court
house
father
is
always
so
punctual
bewailed
the
daughter
it
does
matter
said
gudmund
father
would
have
been
pleased
i
dare
say
to
ride
behind
such
a
fine
horse
and
in
such
a
pretty
cart
as
you
have
remarked
the
girl
pleasantly
gudmund
smiled
a
little
when
he
heard
this
commendation
well
then
i
must
be
off
again
said
he
wo
you
step
in
gudmund
thank
you
hildur
but
i
going
to
the
court
house
you
know
it
do
for
me
to
be
late
now
gudmund
takes
the
direct
road
to
the
court
house
he
was
very
well
pleased
with
himself
and
thought
no
more
of
his
meeting
with
helga
it
was
fortunate
that
only
hildur
had
come
out
on
the
porch
and
that
she
had
seen
the
cart
and
blanket
the
horse
and
harness
she
had
probably
taken
note
of
everything
this
was
the
first
time
gudmund
had
attended
a
court
he
thought
that
there
was
much
to
see
and
learn
and
remained
the
whole
day
he
was
sitting
in
the
court
room
when
helga
case
came
up
saw
how
she
snatched
the
bible
and
hugged
it
close
and
saw
how
she
defied
both
court
attendants
and
judge
when
it
was
all
over
and
the
judge
had
shaken
hands
with
helga
gudmund
rose
quickly
and
went
out
he
hurriedly
hitched
the
horse
to
the
cart
and
drove
up
to
the
steps
he
thought
helga
had
been
brave
and
now
he
wished
to
honor
her
but
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
did
not
understand
his
purpose
and
stole
away
from
his
intended
honor
the
same
day
gudmund
came
to
the
marsh
croft
late
in
the
evening
it
was
a
little
croft
which
lay
at
the
base
of
the
forest
ridge
that
enclosed
the
parish
the
road
leading
thither
was
passable
for
a
horse
only
in
winter
and
gudmund
had
to
go
there
on
foot
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
find
his
way
he
came
near
breaking
his
legs
on
stumps
and
stones
and
he
had
to
wade
through
brooks
which
crossed
the
path
in
several
places
had
it
not
been
for
the
bright
moonlight
he
could
not
have
found
his
way
to
the
croft
he
thought
it
was
a
very
hard
road
that
helga
had
to
tramp
this
day
big
marsh
croft
lay
on
the
clearing
about
up
the
ridge
gudmund
had
never
been
there
before
but
he
had
often
seen
the
place
from
the
valley
and
was
sufficiently
familiar
with
it
to
know
that
he
had
gone
aright
all
around
the
clearing
lay
a
hedge
of
brushwood
which
was
very
thick
and
difficult
to
get
through
it
was
probably
meant
to
be
a
kind
of
defence
and
protection
against
the
whole
wilderness
that
surrounded
the
croft
the
cabin
stood
at
the
upper
edge
of
the
enclosure
before
it
stretched
a
sloping
covered
with
short
thick
grass
and
below
the
yard
lay
a
couple
of
gray
outhouses
and
a
larder
with
a
roof
it
was
a
poor
and
humble
place
but
one
could
deny
that
it
was
picturesque
up
there
the
marsh
from
which
the
croft
had
derived
its
name
lay
somewhere
near
and
sent
forth
mists
which
rose
beautiful
splendid
and
silvery
in
the
moonlight
forming
a
halo
around
the
marsh
the
highest
peak
of
the
mountain
loomed
above
the
mist
and
the
ridge
prickly
with
pines
was
sharply
outlined
against
the
horizon
over
the
valley
shone
the
moon
it
was
so
light
that
one
could
distinguish
fields
and
orchards
and
a
winding
brook
over
which
the
mists
curled
like
the
faintest
smoke
it
was
not
very
far
down
there
but
the
peculiar
thing
was
that
the
valley
lay
like
a
world
apart
with
which
the
forest
and
all
that
belonged
to
it
seemed
to
have
nothing
in
common
it
was
as
if
the
people
who
lived
here
in
the
forest
must
ever
remain
under
the
shadow
of
these
trees
they
might
find
it
quite
as
hard
to
feel
contented
down
in
the
valley
as
woodcock
and
and
lynx
and
gudmund
tramped
across
the
open
and
up
to
the
cabin
there
a
gleam
of
firelight
streamed
through
the
window
as
there
were
no
shades
at
the
windows
he
peeped
into
the
cabin
to
see
if
helga
was
there
a
small
lamp
burned
on
the
table
near
the
window
and
there
sat
the
master
of
the
house
mending
old
shoes
the
mistress
was
seated
farther
back
in
the
room
close
to
the
fireplace
where
a
slow
fire
burned
the
was
before
her
but
she
had
paused
in
her
work
to
play
with
a
little
child
she
had
taken
it
up
from
the
cradle
and
gudmund
heard
how
she
prattled
to
it
her
face
was
lined
and
wrinkled
and
she
looked
severe
but
as
she
bent
over
the
child
she
had
a
mild
expression
and
she
smiled
as
tenderly
at
the
little
one
as
his
own
mother
might
have
done
gudmund
peered
in
but
could
not
see
helga
in
any
corner
of
the
cabin
then
he
thought
it
was
best
to
remain
outside
until
she
came
he
was
surprised
that
she
had
not
reached
home
perhaps
she
had
stopped
on
the
way
somewhere
to
see
an
acquaintance
and
to
get
some
food
and
rest
at
all
events
she
would
have
to
come
back
soon
if
she
wished
to
be
indoors
before
it
was
very
late
at
night
gudmund
stood
still
a
moment
and
listened
for
footsteps
he
thought
that
never
before
had
he
sensed
such
stillness
it
was
as
though
the
whole
forest
held
its
breath
and
stood
waiting
for
something
extraordinary
to
happen
no
one
tramped
in
the
forest
no
branch
was
broken
and
no
stone
rolled
down
surely
helga
wo
be
long
in
coming
i
wonder
what
she
will
say
when
she
sees
that
i
here
thought
gudmund
perhaps
she
will
scream
and
rush
into
the
forest
and
will
not
dare
come
home
the
whole
night
at
the
same
time
it
struck
him
as
rather
strange
that
now
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
so
much
business
with
that
marsh
croft
girl
on
his
return
from
the
court
house
to
his
home
he
had
as
usual
gone
to
his
mother
to
relate
his
experiences
of
the
day
gudmund
mother
was
a
sensible
and
woman
who
had
always
understood
how
to
treat
her
son
and
he
had
as
much
confidence
in
her
now
as
when
he
was
a
child
she
had
been
an
invalid
for
several
years
and
could
not
walk
but
sat
all
day
in
her
chair
it
was
always
a
good
hour
for
her
when
gudmund
came
home
from
an
outing
and
brought
her
the
news
when
gudmund
had
told
his
mother
about
helga
from
big
marsh
he
observed
that
she
became
thoughtful
for
a
long
while
she
sat
quietly
and
looked
straight
ahead
there
seems
to
be
something
good
in
that
girl
still
she
remarked
it
will
never
do
to
condemn
a
person
because
she
has
once
met
with
misfortune
she
might
be
very
grateful
to
any
one
who
helped
her
now
gudmund
apprehended
at
once
what
his
mother
was
thinking
of
she
could
no
longer
help
herself
but
must
have
some
one
near
her
continually
and
it
was
always
difficult
to
find
anybody
who
cared
to
remain
in
that
capacity
his
mother
was
exacting
and
not
easy
to
get
on
with
and
moreover
all
young
folk
preferred
other
work
where
they
could
have
more
freedom
now
it
must
have
occurred
to
his
mother
that
she
ought
to
take
helga
from
big
marsh
into
her
service
and
gudmund
thought
this
a
capital
idea
helga
would
certainly
be
very
devoted
to
his
mother
it
will
be
hard
for
the
child
remarked
the
mother
after
a
little
and
gudmund
understood
that
she
was
thinking
seriously
of
the
matter
surely
the
parents
would
let
it
stay
with
them
said
gudmund
it
does
not
follow
that
she
wants
to
part
with
it
she
will
have
to
give
up
thinking
of
what
she
wants
or
does
want
i
thought
that
she
looked
starved
out
they
ca
have
much
to
eat
at
the
croft
said
the
son
to
this
his
mother
made
no
reply
but
began
to
talk
of
something
else
it
was
evident
that
some
new
misgivings
had
come
to
her
which
hindered
her
from
coming
to
a
decision
then
gudmund
told
her
of
how
he
had
found
a
pretext
for
calling
at
the
juryman
at
älvåkra
and
had
met
hildur
he
mentioned
what
she
had
said
of
the
horse
and
wagon
and
it
was
easily
seen
that
he
was
pleased
with
the
meeting
his
mother
was
also
very
much
pleased
where
she
sat
in
the
cottage
unable
to
move
from
her
chair
it
was
her
constant
occupation
to
spin
plans
for
her
son
future
and
it
was
she
who
had
first
hit
upon
the
idea
that
he
should
try
and
set
his
cap
for
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
juryman
it
was
the
finest
match
he
could
make
the
juryman
was
a
yeoman
farmer
he
owned
the
largest
farm
in
the
parish
and
had
much
money
and
power
it
was
really
absurd
to
hope
that
he
would
be
satisfied
with
a
with
no
more
wealth
than
gudmund
but
it
was
also
possible
that
he
would
conform
to
his
daughter
wishes
that
gudmund
could
win
hildur
if
he
so
wished
his
mother
was
certain
this
was
the
first
time
gudmund
had
betrayed
to
his
mother
that
her
thought
had
taken
root
in
him
and
they
talked
long
of
hildur
and
of
all
the
riches
and
advantages
that
would
come
to
the
chosen
one
soon
there
was
another
lull
in
the
conversation
for
his
mother
was
again
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
could
you
send
for
this
helga
i
should
like
to
see
her
before
taking
her
into
my
service
said
the
mother
finally
it
is
well
mother
that
you
wish
to
take
her
under
your
wing
remarked
gudmund
thinking
to
himself
that
if
his
mother
had
a
nurse
with
whom
she
was
satisfied
his
wife
would
have
a
pleasanter
life
here
you
see
that
you
will
be
pleased
with
the
girl
he
continued
then
too
it
would
be
a
good
deed
to
take
her
in
hand
added
the
mother
as
it
grew
dusk
the
invalid
retired
and
gudmund
went
out
to
the
stable
to
tend
the
horses
it
was
beautiful
weather
with
a
clear
atmosphere
and
the
whole
tract
lay
bathed
in
moonlight
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
go
to
big
marsh
and
convey
his
greeting
if
the
weather
should
continue
clear
on
the
morrow
he
would
be
so
busy
taking
in
oats
that
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
would
find
time
to
go
there
now
that
gudmund
was
standing
outside
the
cabin
at
big
marsh
croft
listening
he
certainly
heard
no
footsteps
but
there
were
other
sounds
which
at
short
intervals
pierced
through
the
stillness
he
heard
a
soft
weeping
a
very
low
and
smothered
moaning
with
now
and
then
a
sob
gudmund
thought
that
the
sounds
came
from
the
outhouse
lane
and
he
walked
toward
it
as
he
was
nearing
the
sobs
ceased
but
it
was
evident
that
some
one
moved
in
the
woodshed
gudmund
seemed
to
comprehend
instantly
who
was
there
is
it
you
helga
who
sit
here
and
weep
asked
gudmund
placing
himself
in
the
doorway
so
that
the
girl
could
not
rush
away
before
he
had
spoken
with
her
again
it
was
perfectly
still
gudmund
had
guessed
rightly
that
it
was
helga
who
sat
there
and
wept
but
she
tried
to
smother
the
sobs
so
that
gudmund
would
think
he
had
heard
wrongly
and
go
away
it
was
pitch
dark
in
the
woodshed
and
she
knew
that
he
could
not
see
her
but
helga
was
in
such
despair
that
evening
it
was
not
easy
for
her
to
keep
back
the
sobs
she
had
not
as
yet
gone
into
the
cabin
to
see
her
parents
she
had
had
the
courage
to
go
in
when
she
trudged
up
the
steep
hill
in
the
twilight
and
thought
of
how
she
must
tell
her
parents
that
she
was
not
to
receive
any
assistance
from
per
mårtensson
in
the
rearing
of
her
child
she
began
to
fear
all
the
harsh
and
cruel
things
she
felt
they
would
say
to
her
and
thought
of
burying
herself
in
the
swamp
and
in
her
terror
she
jumped
up
and
tried
to
rush
past
gudmund
but
he
was
too
alert
for
her
oh
no
you
get
by
before
i
have
spoken
with
you
only
let
me
go
she
said
looking
wildly
at
him
you
look
as
though
you
wanted
to
jump
into
the
river
said
he
for
now
she
was
out
in
the
moonlight
and
he
could
see
her
face
well
what
matters
it
if
i
did
said
helga
throwing
her
head
back
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
this
morning
you
did
even
care
to
have
me
ride
on
the
back
of
your
cart
no
one
wants
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
you
must
surely
understand
that
it
is
best
for
a
miserable
creature
like
me
to
put
an
end
to
herself
gudmund
did
not
know
what
to
do
next
he
wished
himself
far
away
but
he
thought
also
that
he
could
not
desert
a
person
who
was
in
such
distress
listen
to
me
only
promise
that
you
will
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
afterwards
you
may
go
wherever
you
wish
she
promised
is
there
anything
here
to
sit
on
the
is
over
yonder
then
go
over
there
and
sit
down
and
be
quiet
she
went
very
obediently
and
seated
herself
and
do
cry
any
more
said
he
for
he
thought
he
was
beginning
to
get
control
over
her
but
he
should
not
have
said
this
for
immediately
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
cried
harder
than
ever
stop
crying
he
said
ready
to
stamp
his
foot
at
her
there
are
those
i
dare
say
who
are
worse
off
than
you
are
no
no
one
can
be
worse
off
you
are
young
and
strong
you
should
see
how
my
mother
fares
she
is
so
wasted
from
suffering
that
she
can
not
move
but
she
never
complains
she
is
not
abandoned
by
everybody
as
i
am
you
are
not
abandoned
either
i
have
spoken
with
my
mother
about
you
there
was
a
pause
in
the
sobs
one
heard
as
it
were
the
great
stillness
of
the
forest
which
always
held
its
breath
and
waited
for
something
wonderful
i
was
to
say
to
you
that
you
should
come
down
to
my
mother
that
she
might
see
you
mother
thinks
of
asking
if
you
would
care
to
take
service
with
us
did
she
think
of
asking
yes
but
she
wants
to
see
you
first
does
she
know
that
she
knows
as
much
about
you
as
all
the
rest
do
the
girl
leaped
up
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
wonderment
and
the
next
moment
gudmund
felt
a
pair
of
arms
around
his
neck
he
was
thoroughly
frightened
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
break
loose
and
run
but
he
calmed
himself
and
stood
still
he
understood
that
the
girl
was
so
beside
herself
with
joy
that
she
did
know
what
she
was
doing
at
that
moment
she
could
have
hugged
the
worst
ruffian
only
to
find
a
little
sympathy
in
the
great
happiness
that
had
come
to
her
if
she
will
take
me
into
her
service
i
can
live
said
she
burying
her
head
on
gudmund
breast
and
weeping
again
you
may
know
that
i
was
in
earnest
when
i
wished
to
go
down
into
the
swamp
she
said
you
deserve
thanks
for
coming
you
have
saved
my
life
until
then
gudmund
had
been
standing
motionless
but
now
he
felt
that
something
tender
and
warm
was
beginning
to
stir
within
him
he
raised
his
hand
and
stroked
her
hair
then
she
started
as
if
awakened
from
a
dream
and
stood
up
straight
as
a
rod
before
him
you
deserve
thanks
for
coming
she
repeated
she
had
become
in
the
face
and
he
too
reddened
well
then
you
will
come
home
he
said
putting
out
his
hand
to
say
i
shall
never
forget
that
you
came
to
me
said
helga
and
her
great
gratitude
got
the
mastery
over
her
shyness
oh
yes
it
was
well
perhaps
that
i
came
he
said
quite
calmly
and
he
felt
rather
pleased
with
himself
you
will
go
in
now
of
course
yes
now
i
shall
go
in
gudmund
suddenly
felt
himself
rather
pleased
with
helga
too
as
one
usually
is
with
a
person
whom
one
has
succeeded
in
helping
she
lingered
and
did
not
want
to
go
i
would
like
to
see
you
safely
under
shelter
before
i
leave
i
thought
they
might
retire
before
i
went
in
no
you
must
go
in
at
once
so
that
you
can
have
your
supper
and
rest
yourself
said
he
thinking
it
was
agreeable
to
take
her
in
hand
she
went
at
once
to
the
cabin
and
he
accompanied
her
pleased
and
proud
because
she
obeyed
him
when
she
stood
on
the
threshold
they
said
to
each
other
again
but
before
he
had
gone
two
paces
she
came
after
him
remain
just
outside
the
door
until
i
am
in
it
will
be
easier
for
me
if
i
know
that
you
are
standing
without
yes
said
he
i
shall
stand
here
until
you
have
come
over
the
worst
of
it
then
helga
opened
the
cabin
door
and
gudmund
noticed
that
she
left
it
slightly
ajar
it
was
as
if
she
did
not
wish
to
feel
herself
separated
from
her
helper
who
stood
without
nor
did
he
feel
any
compunction
about
hearing
all
that
happened
within
the
cabin
the
old
folks
nodded
pleasantly
to
helga
as
she
came
in
her
mother
promptly
laid
the
child
in
the
crib
and
then
went
over
to
the
cupboard
and
brought
out
a
bowl
of
milk
and
a
bread
cake
and
placed
them
on
the
table
there
now
sit
down
and
eat
said
she
then
she
went
up
to
the
fireplace
and
freshened
the
fire
i
have
kept
the
fire
alive
so
you
could
dry
your
feet
and
warm
yourself
when
you
came
home
but
eat
something
first
it
is
food
that
you
need
most
all
the
while
helga
had
been
standing
at
the
door
you
must
receive
me
so
well
mother
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
will
get
no
money
from
per
i
have
renounced
his
help
there
was
some
one
here
from
the
court
house
this
evening
who
had
been
there
and
heard
how
it
turned
out
for
you
said
the
mother
we
know
all
helga
was
still
standing
by
the
door
looking
out
as
if
she
knew
not
which
was
in
or
out
then
the
farmer
put
down
his
work
pushed
his
spectacles
up
on
his
forehead
and
cleared
his
throat
for
a
speech
of
which
he
had
been
thinking
the
whole
evening
it
is
a
fact
helga
said
he
that
mother
and
i
have
always
wanted
to
be
decent
and
honorable
folk
but
we
have
thought
that
we
had
been
disgraced
on
your
account
it
was
as
though
we
had
not
taught
you
to
distinguish
between
good
and
evil
but
when
we
learned
what
you
did
we
said
to
each
other
mother
and
i
that
now
folks
could
see
anyway
that
you
have
had
a
proper
bringing
up
and
right
teaching
and
we
thought
that
perhaps
we
might
yet
be
happy
in
you
and
mother
did
not
want
that
we
should
go
to
bed
before
you
came
that
you
might
have
a
hearty
welcome
home
iii
helga
from
the
marsh
croft
came
to
närlunda
and
there
all
went
well
she
was
willing
and
teachable
and
grateful
for
every
kind
word
said
to
her
she
always
felt
herself
to
be
the
humblest
of
mortals
and
never
wanted
to
push
herself
ahead
it
was
not
long
until
the
household
and
the
servants
were
satisfied
with
her
the
first
days
it
appeared
as
if
gudmund
was
afraid
to
speak
to
helga
he
feared
that
this
croft
girl
would
get
notions
into
her
head
because
he
had
come
to
her
assistance
but
these
were
needless
worries
helga
regarded
him
as
altogether
too
fine
and
noble
for
her
even
to
raise
her
eyes
to
gudmund
soon
perceived
that
he
did
not
have
to
keep
her
at
a
distance
she
was
more
shy
of
him
than
of
any
one
else
the
autumn
that
helga
came
to
närlunda
gudmund
paid
many
visits
to
älvåkra
and
there
was
much
talk
about
the
good
chance
he
stood
of
being
the
prospective
of
this
estate
that
the
courtship
had
been
successful
all
were
assured
at
christmas
then
the
juryman
with
his
wife
and
daughter
came
over
to
närlunda
and
it
was
evident
that
they
had
come
there
to
see
how
hildur
would
fare
if
she
married
gudmund
this
was
the
first
time
that
helga
saw
at
close
range
her
whom
gudmund
was
to
marry
hildur
ericsdotter
was
not
yet
twenty
but
the
marked
thing
about
her
was
that
no
one
could
look
at
her
without
thinking
what
a
handsome
and
dignified
mistress
she
would
be
some
day
she
was
tall
and
well
built
fair
and
pretty
and
apparently
liked
to
have
many
about
her
to
look
after
she
was
never
timid
she
talked
much
and
seemed
to
know
everything
better
than
the
one
with
whom
she
was
talking
she
had
attended
school
in
the
city
for
a
couple
of
years
and
wore
the
prettiest
frocks
helga
had
ever
seen
but
yet
she
did
impress
one
as
being
showy
or
vain
rich
and
beautiful
as
she
was
she
might
have
married
a
gentleman
at
any
time
but
she
always
declared
that
she
did
not
wish
to
be
a
fine
lady
and
sit
with
folded
hands
she
wanted
to
marry
a
farmer
and
look
after
her
own
house
like
a
real
farmer
wife
helga
thought
hildur
a
perfect
wonder
never
had
she
seen
any
one
who
made
such
a
superb
appearance
nor
had
she
ever
dreamed
that
a
person
could
be
so
nearly
perfect
in
every
particular
to
her
it
seemed
a
great
joy
that
in
the
near
future
she
was
to
serve
such
a
mistress
everything
had
gone
off
well
during
the
juryman
visit
but
whenever
helga
looked
back
upon
that
day
she
experienced
a
certain
unrest
it
seems
that
when
the
visitors
had
arrived
she
had
gone
around
and
served
coffee
when
she
came
in
with
the
tray
the
juryman
wife
leaned
forward
and
asked
her
mistress
if
she
was
not
the
girl
from
the
marsh
croft
she
did
not
lower
her
voice
much
and
helga
had
distinctly
heard
the
question
mother
ingeborg
answered
yes
and
then
the
other
had
said
something
which
helga
could
hear
but
it
was
to
the
effect
that
she
thought
it
singular
they
wanted
a
person
of
that
sort
in
the
house
this
caused
helga
many
anxious
moments
she
tried
to
console
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
not
hildur
but
her
mother
who
had
said
this
one
sunday
in
the
early
spring
helga
and
gudmund
walked
home
together
from
church
as
they
came
down
the
slope
they
were
with
the
other
church
people
but
soon
one
after
another
dropped
off
until
finally
helga
and
gudmund
were
alone
then
gudmund
happened
to
think
that
he
had
not
been
alone
with
helga
since
that
night
at
the
croft
and
the
memory
of
that
night
came
forcibly
back
to
him
he
had
thought
of
their
first
meeting
often
enough
during
the
winter
and
with
it
he
had
always
felt
something
sweet
and
pleasant
thrill
through
his
senses
as
he
went
about
his
work
he
would
call
forth
in
thought
that
whole
beautiful
evening
the
white
mist
the
bright
moonlight
the
dark
forest
heights
the
light
valley
and
the
girl
who
had
thrown
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
wept
for
joy
the
whole
incident
became
more
beautiful
each
time
that
it
recurred
to
his
memory
but
when
gudmund
saw
helga
going
about
among
the
others
at
home
toiling
and
slaving
it
was
hard
for
him
to
think
that
it
was
she
who
had
shared
in
this
now
that
he
was
walking
alone
with
her
on
the
church
slope
he
could
help
wishing
for
a
moment
that
she
would
be
the
same
girl
she
was
on
that
evening
helga
began
immediately
to
speak
of
hildur
she
praised
her
much
said
she
was
the
prettiest
and
most
sensible
girl
in
the
whole
parish
and
congratulated
gudmund
because
he
would
have
such
an
excellent
wife
you
must
tell
her
to
let
me
remain
always
at
närlunda
she
said
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
work
for
a
mistress
like
her
gudmund
smiled
at
her
enthusiasm
but
answered
only
in
monosyllables
as
though
he
did
not
exactly
follow
her
it
was
well
of
course
that
she
was
so
fond
of
hildur
and
so
happy
because
he
was
going
to
be
married
you
have
been
content
to
be
with
us
this
winter
he
asked
indeed
i
have
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
how
kind
mother
ingeborg
and
all
of
you
have
been
to
me
have
you
not
been
homesick
for
the
forest
oh
yes
in
the
beginning
but
not
now
any
more
i
thought
that
one
who
belonged
to
the
forest
could
not
help
yearning
for
it
helga
turned
half
round
and
looked
at
him
who
walked
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
gudmund
had
become
almost
a
stranger
to
her
but
now
there
was
something
in
his
voice
his
smile
that
was
familiar
yes
he
was
the
same
man
who
had
come
to
her
and
saved
her
in
her
greatest
distress
although
he
was
to
marry
another
she
was
certain
that
he
wanted
to
be
a
good
friend
to
her
and
a
faithful
helper
she
was
very
happy
to
feel
that
she
could
confide
in
him
as
in
none
other
and
thought
that
she
must
tell
him
of
all
that
had
happened
to
her
since
they
last
talked
together
i
must
tell
you
that
it
was
rather
hard
for
me
the
first
weeks
at
närlunda
she
began
but
you
speak
of
this
to
your
mother
if
you
want
me
to
be
silent
i
be
silent
fancy
i
was
so
homesick
in
the
beginning
that
i
was
about
to
go
back
to
the
forest
were
you
homesick
i
thought
you
were
glad
to
be
with
us
i
simply
could
not
help
it
she
said
apologetically
i
understood
of
course
how
well
it
was
for
me
to
be
here
you
were
all
so
good
to
me
and
the
work
was
not
so
hard
but
that
i
could
manage
with
it
but
i
was
homesick
nevertheless
there
was
something
that
took
hold
of
me
and
wanted
to
draw
me
back
to
the
forest
i
thought
that
i
was
deserting
and
betraying
some
one
who
had
a
right
to
me
when
i
wanted
to
stay
here
in
the
village
it
was
perhaps
began
gudmund
but
checked
himself
no
it
was
not
the
boy
i
longed
for
i
knew
that
he
was
well
cared
for
and
that
mother
was
kind
to
him
it
was
nothing
in
particular
i
felt
as
though
i
were
a
wild
bird
that
had
been
caged
and
i
thought
i
should
die
if
i
were
not
let
out
to
think
that
you
had
such
a
hard
time
of
it
said
gudmund
smiling
for
now
all
at
once
he
recognized
her
now
it
was
as
if
nothing
had
come
between
them
but
that
they
had
parted
at
the
forest
farm
the
evening
before
helga
smiled
again
but
continued
to
speak
of
her
torments
i
sleep
a
single
night
said
she
and
as
soon
as
i
went
to
bed
the
tears
started
to
flow
and
when
i
got
up
of
a
morning
the
pillow
was
wet
through
in
the
daytime
when
i
went
about
among
all
of
you
i
could
keep
back
the
tears
but
as
soon
as
i
was
alone
my
eyes
would
fill
up
you
have
wept
much
in
your
time
said
gudmund
without
looking
the
least
bit
sympathetic
as
he
pronounced
the
words
helga
thought
that
he
was
laughing
to
himself
all
the
while
you
surely
do
comprehend
how
hard
it
was
for
me
she
said
speaking
faster
and
faster
in
her
effort
to
make
him
understand
her
a
great
longing
took
possession
of
me
and
carried
me
out
of
myself
not
for
a
moment
could
i
feel
happy
nothing
was
beautiful
nothing
was
a
pleasure
not
a
human
being
could
i
become
attached
to
you
all
remained
just
as
strange
to
me
as
you
were
the
first
time
i
entered
the
house
but
did
you
say
a
moment
ago
that
you
wished
to
remain
with
us
said
gudmund
wonderingly
of
course
i
did
then
surely
you
are
not
homesick
now
no
it
has
passed
over
i
have
been
cured
wait
and
you
shall
hear
as
she
said
this
gudmund
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
walked
beside
her
laughing
to
himself
all
the
while
he
seemed
glad
to
hear
her
speak
but
probably
he
did
attach
much
importance
to
what
she
was
relating
gradually
helga
took
on
his
mood
and
she
thought
everything
was
becoming
easy
and
light
the
church
road
was
long
and
difficult
to
walk
but
she
was
not
tired
there
was
something
that
carried
her
she
continued
with
her
story
because
she
had
begun
it
but
it
was
no
longer
of
much
importance
to
her
to
speak
it
would
have
been
quite
as
agreeable
to
her
if
she
might
have
walked
silently
beside
him
when
i
was
the
most
unhappy
she
said
i
asked
mother
ingeborg
one
saturday
evening
to
let
me
go
home
and
remain
over
sunday
and
that
evening
as
i
tramped
over
the
hills
to
the
marsh
i
believed
positively
that
i
should
never
again
go
back
to
närlunda
but
at
home
father
and
mother
were
so
happy
because
i
had
found
service
with
good
and
respectable
people
that
i
did
dare
tell
them
i
could
not
endure
remaining
with
you
then
too
as
soon
as
i
came
up
into
the
forest
all
the
anguish
and
pain
vanished
entirely
i
thought
the
whole
thing
had
been
only
a
fancy
and
then
it
was
so
difficult
about
the
child
mother
had
become
attached
to
the
boy
and
had
made
him
her
own
he
was
mine
any
more
and
it
was
well
thus
but
it
was
hard
to
get
used
to
perhaps
you
began
to
be
homesick
for
us
blurted
gudmund
oh
no
on
monday
morning
as
i
awoke
and
thought
of
having
to
return
to
you
the
longing
came
over
me
again
i
lay
crying
and
fretting
because
the
only
right
and
proper
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
go
back
to
närlunda
but
i
felt
all
the
same
as
though
i
were
going
to
be
ill
or
lose
my
senses
if
i
went
back
suddenly
i
remembered
having
once
heard
some
one
say
that
if
one
took
some
ashes
from
the
hearth
in
one
own
home
and
strewed
them
on
the
fire
in
the
strange
place
one
would
be
rid
of
homesickness
then
it
was
a
remedy
that
was
easy
to
take
said
gudmund
yes
but
it
was
supposed
to
have
this
effect
also
afterwards
one
could
never
be
content
in
any
other
place
if
one
were
to
move
from
the
homestead
to
which
one
had
borne
the
ashes
one
must
long
to
get
back
there
again
just
as
much
as
one
had
longed
before
to
get
away
from
there
could
one
carry
ashes
along
wherever
one
moved
to
no
it
ca
be
done
more
than
once
afterwards
there
is
no
turning
back
so
it
was
a
great
risk
to
try
anything
like
that
i
should
have
taken
chances
on
a
thing
of
that
kind
said
gudmund
and
she
could
hear
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
but
i
dared
all
the
same
retorted
helga
it
was
better
than
having
to
appear
as
an
ingrate
in
your
mother
eyes
and
in
yours
when
you
had
tried
to
help
me
i
brought
a
little
ashes
from
home
and
when
i
got
back
to
närlunda
i
watched
my
opportunity
when
no
one
was
in
and
scattered
the
ashes
over
the
hearth
and
now
you
believe
it
is
ashes
that
have
helped
you
wait
and
you
shall
hear
how
it
turned
out
immediately
i
became
absorbed
in
my
work
and
thought
no
more
about
the
ashes
all
that
day
i
grieved
exactly
as
before
and
was
just
as
weary
of
everything
as
i
had
been
there
was
much
to
be
done
that
day
both
in
the
house
and
out
of
it
and
when
i
finished
with
the
evening
milking
and
was
going
in
the
fire
on
the
hearth
was
already
lighted
now
i
very
curious
to
hear
what
happened
said
gudmund
think
already
as
i
was
crossing
the
house
yard
i
thought
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
gleam
from
the
fire
and
when
i
opened
the
door
it
flashed
across
my
mind
that
i
was
going
into
our
own
cabin
and
that
father
and
mother
would
be
sitting
by
the
hearth
this
flew
past
like
a
dream
but
when
i
came
in
i
was
surprised
that
it
looked
so
pretty
and
homelike
in
the
cottage
to
me
your
mother
and
the
rest
of
you
had
never
appeared
as
pleasant
as
you
did
in
the
firelight
it
seemed
really
good
to
come
in
and
this
was
not
so
before
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
could
hardly
keep
from
clapping
my
hands
and
shouting
i
thought
you
were
all
so
changed
you
were
no
longer
strangers
to
me
and
i
could
talk
to
you
about
all
sorts
of
things
you
can
understand
of
course
that
i
was
happy
but
i
could
help
being
astonished
i
wondered
if
i
had
been
bewitched
and
then
i
remembered
the
ashes
i
had
strewn
over
the
hearth
yes
it
was
marvellous
said
gudmund
he
did
not
believe
the
least
little
bit
in
witchcraft
and
was
not
at
all
superstitious
but
he
dislike
hearing
helga
talk
of
such
things
now
the
wild
forest
girl
has
returned
thought
he
can
anybody
comprehend
how
one
who
has
passed
through
all
that
she
has
can
still
be
so
childish
of
course
it
was
wonderful
said
helga
and
the
same
thing
has
been
coming
back
all
winter
as
soon
as
the
fire
on
the
hearth
was
burning
i
felt
the
same
confidence
and
security
as
if
i
had
been
at
home
but
there
must
be
something
extraordinary
about
this
fire
not
with
any
other
kind
of
fire
perhaps
only
that
which
burns
on
a
hearth
with
all
the
household
gathered
around
it
night
after
night
it
gets
sort
of
acquainted
with
one
it
plays
and
dances
for
one
and
talks
to
one
and
sometimes
it
is
it
is
as
if
it
had
the
power
to
create
comfort
and
discomfort
i
thought
now
that
the
fire
from
home
had
come
to
me
and
that
it
gave
the
same
glow
of
pleasure
to
every
one
here
that
it
had
done
back
home
what
if
you
had
to
leave
närlunda
said
gudmund
then
i
must
long
to
come
back
again
all
my
life
said
she
and
the
quiver
in
her
voice
betrayed
that
this
was
spoken
in
profound
seriousness
well
i
shall
not
be
the
one
to
drive
you
away
said
gudmund
although
he
was
laughing
there
was
something
warm
in
his
tone
they
started
no
new
subject
of
conversation
but
walked
on
in
silence
until
they
came
to
the
homestead
now
and
then
gudmund
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her
who
was
walking
at
his
side
she
had
gathered
strength
after
her
hard
time
of
the
year
before
her
features
were
delicate
and
refined
her
hair
was
like
an
aureole
around
her
head
and
her
eyes
were
not
easy
to
read
her
step
was
light
and
elastic
and
when
she
spoke
the
words
came
readily
yet
modestly
she
was
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
still
she
had
to
speak
out
what
was
in
her
heart
gudmund
wondered
if
he
wished
hildur
to
be
like
this
but
he
probably
did
this
helga
would
be
nothing
special
to
marry
a
fortnight
later
helga
heard
that
she
must
leave
närlunda
in
april
because
hildur
ericsdotter
would
not
live
under
the
same
roof
with
her
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
did
not
say
this
in
so
many
words
but
the
mistress
hinted
that
when
the
new
came
they
would
in
all
probability
get
so
much
help
from
her
they
would
not
require
so
many
servants
on
another
occasion
she
said
she
had
heard
of
a
good
place
where
helga
would
fare
better
than
with
them
it
was
not
necessary
for
helga
to
hear
anything
further
to
understand
that
she
must
leave
and
she
immediately
announced
that
she
would
move
but
she
did
not
wish
any
other
situation
and
would
return
to
her
home
it
was
apparent
that
it
was
not
of
their
own
free
will
they
were
dismissing
helga
from
närlunda
when
she
was
leaving
there
was
a
spread
for
her
it
was
like
a
party
and
mother
ingeborg
gave
her
such
heaps
of
dresses
and
shoes
that
she
who
had
come
to
them
with
only
a
bundle
under
her
arm
could
now
barely
find
room
enough
in
a
chest
for
her
possessions
i
shall
never
again
have
such
an
excellent
servant
in
my
house
as
you
have
been
said
mother
ingeborg
and
do
not
think
too
hard
of
me
for
letting
you
go
you
understand
no
doubt
that
it
is
not
my
will
this
i
shall
not
forget
you
so
long
as
i
have
any
power
you
shall
never
have
to
suffer
want
she
arranged
with
helga
that
she
was
to
weave
sheets
and
towels
for
her
she
gave
her
employment
for
at
least
half
a
year
gudmund
was
in
the
woodshed
splitting
wood
the
day
helga
was
leaving
he
did
not
come
in
to
say
although
his
horse
was
at
the
door
he
appeared
to
be
so
busy
that
he
did
take
note
of
what
was
going
on
she
had
to
go
out
to
him
to
say
farewell
he
laid
down
the
axe
took
helga
hand
and
said
rather
hurriedly
thank
you
for
all
and
began
chopping
again
helga
had
wanted
to
say
something
about
her
understanding
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
keep
her
and
that
it
was
all
her
own
fault
she
had
brought
this
upon
herself
but
gudmund
chopped
away
until
the
splinters
flew
around
him
and
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
speak
but
the
strangest
thing
about
this
whole
moving
affair
was
that
the
master
himself
old
erland
erlandsson
drove
helga
up
to
the
marsh
gudmund
father
was
a
little
weazened
man
with
a
bald
pate
and
beautiful
and
knowing
eyes
he
was
very
timid
and
so
reticent
at
times
that
he
did
not
speak
a
word
the
whole
day
so
long
as
everything
went
smoothly
one
took
no
notice
of
him
but
when
anything
went
wrong
he
always
said
and
did
what
there
was
to
be
said
and
done
to
right
matters
he
was
a
capable
accountant
and
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
every
man
in
the
township
he
executed
all
kinds
of
public
commissions
and
was
more
respected
than
many
a
man
with
a
large
estate
and
great
riches
erland
erlandsson
drove
helga
home
in
his
own
wagon
and
he
allow
her
to
step
down
and
walk
up
any
of
the
hills
when
they
arrived
at
the
marsh
croft
he
sat
a
long
while
in
the
cabin
and
talked
with
helga
parents
telling
them
of
how
pleased
he
and
mother
ingeborg
had
been
with
her
it
was
only
because
they
did
not
need
so
many
servants
that
they
were
sending
her
home
she
who
was
the
youngest
must
go
they
had
felt
that
it
was
wrong
to
dismiss
any
of
those
who
were
old
in
their
service
erland
erlandsson
speech
had
the
desired
effect
and
the
parents
gave
helga
a
warm
welcome
when
they
heard
that
she
had
received
such
large
orders
that
she
could
support
herself
with
weaving
they
were
satisfied
and
she
remained
at
home
iv
gudmund
thought
that
he
had
loved
hildur
until
the
day
when
she
exacted
from
him
the
promise
that
helga
should
be
sent
away
from
närlunda
at
least
up
to
that
time
there
was
no
one
whom
he
had
esteemed
more
highly
than
hildur
no
other
young
girl
to
his
thinking
could
come
up
to
her
it
had
been
a
pleasure
for
him
to
picture
a
future
with
hildur
they
would
be
rich
and
looked
up
to
and
he
felt
instinctively
that
the
home
hildur
managed
would
be
good
to
live
in
he
liked
also
to
think
that
he
would
be
well
supplied
with
money
after
he
had
married
her
he
could
then
improve
the
land
rebuild
all
the
houses
extend
the
farm
and
be
a
real
landed
proprietor
the
same
sunday
that
he
had
walked
home
from
church
with
helga
he
had
driven
over
to
älvåkra
in
the
evening
then
hildur
had
started
talking
about
helga
and
had
said
that
she
would
come
to
närlunda
until
that
girl
was
sent
away
at
first
gudmund
had
tried
to
dismiss
the
whole
matter
as
a
jest
but
it
was
soon
obvious
that
hildur
was
in
earnest
gudmund
pleaded
helga
cause
exceedingly
well
and
remarked
that
she
was
very
young
when
first
sent
out
to
service
and
it
was
not
strange
that
things
went
badly
when
she
came
across
such
a
worthless
fellow
as
per
mårtensson
but
since
his
mother
had
taken
her
in
hand
she
had
always
conducted
herself
well
it
ca
be
right
to
push
her
out
said
he
then
perhaps
she
might
meet
with
misfortune
again
but
hildur
would
not
yield
if
that
girl
is
to
remain
at
närlunda
then
i
will
never
come
there
she
declared
i
can
not
tolerate
a
person
of
that
kind
in
my
home
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
said
gudmund
no
one
understands
so
well
as
helga
how
to
care
for
mother
we
have
all
been
glad
that
she
came
to
us
before
she
came
mother
was
often
peevish
and
depressed
i
shall
not
compel
you
to
send
her
away
said
hildur
but
it
was
clear
that
if
gudmund
were
to
take
her
at
her
word
in
this
instance
she
was
ready
to
break
the
engagement
it
will
probably
have
to
be
as
you
wish
said
gudmund
he
did
not
feel
that
he
could
jeopardize
his
whole
future
for
helga
sake
but
he
was
very
pale
when
he
acquiesced
and
he
was
silent
and
the
entire
evening
it
was
this
which
had
caused
gudmund
to
fear
that
perhaps
hildur
was
not
altogether
what
he
had
fancied
her
he
did
not
like
i
dare
say
that
she
had
pitted
her
will
against
his
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
comprehend
anything
else
than
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
he
felt
that
he
would
willingly
have
given
in
to
her
had
she
been
but
instead
it
seemed
to
him
she
was
only
petty
and
heartless
once
his
doubts
were
awakened
it
was
not
long
before
he
perceived
one
thing
and
another
which
were
not
as
he
wished
doubtless
she
is
one
of
those
who
think
first
and
foremost
of
themselves
he
muttered
every
time
he
parted
from
her
and
he
wondered
how
long
her
love
for
him
would
last
if
it
were
put
to
the
test
he
tried
to
console
himself
with
the
idea
that
all
people
thought
of
themselves
first
but
instantly
helga
flashed
into
his
mind
he
saw
her
as
she
stood
in
the
court
room
and
snatched
the
bible
and
heard
how
she
cried
out
i
withdraw
the
suit
i
am
still
fond
of
him
and
i
do
want
him
to
swear
falsely
it
was
thus
he
would
have
hildur
helga
had
become
for
him
a
standard
by
which
he
measured
people
though
certainly
there
were
many
who
were
equal
to
her
in
affection
day
by
day
he
thought
less
of
hildur
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
should
relinquish
his
prospective
bride
he
tried
to
imagine
his
discouragement
was
simply
an
idle
whim
only
a
few
weeks
ago
he
regarded
her
as
the
best
in
the
world
had
this
been
at
the
beginning
of
the
courtship
he
would
have
withdrawn
perhaps
but
now
the
banns
were
already
published
and
the
wedding
day
fixed
and
in
his
home
they
had
begun
repairing
and
rebuilding
nor
did
he
wish
to
forfeit
the
wealth
and
the
good
social
position
which
awaited
him
what
excuse
could
he
offer
for
breaking
the
engagement
that
which
he
had
to
bring
against
hildur
was
so
inconsequential
that
it
would
have
turned
to
air
on
his
lips
had
he
attempted
to
express
it
but
the
heart
of
him
was
often
heavy
and
every
time
he
had
an
errand
down
to
the
parish
or
the
city
he
bought
ale
or
wine
at
the
shops
to
drink
himself
into
a
good
humor
when
he
had
emptied
a
couple
of
bottles
he
was
again
proud
of
the
marriage
and
pleased
with
hildur
then
he
did
understand
what
it
was
that
pained
him
gudmund
often
thought
of
helga
and
longed
to
meet
her
but
he
fancied
that
helga
believed
him
a
wretch
because
he
had
not
kept
the
promise
which
he
voluntarily
made
her
but
had
allowed
her
to
go
away
he
could
neither
explain
nor
excuse
himself
therefore
he
avoided
her
one
morning
when
gudmund
was
walking
up
the
road
he
met
helga
who
had
been
down
in
the
village
to
buy
milk
gudmund
turned
about
and
joined
her
she
did
appear
to
be
pleased
with
his
company
and
walked
rapidly
as
if
she
wished
to
get
away
from
him
and
said
nothing
gudmund
too
kept
still
because
he
did
quite
know
how
he
should
begin
the
conversation
a
vehicle
was
seen
on
the
road
far
behind
gudmund
was
absorbed
in
thought
and
did
not
mark
it
but
helga
had
seen
it
and
turned
abruptly
to
him
it
is
not
worth
your
while
to
be
in
my
company
gudmund
for
unless
i
see
wrongly
it
is
the
juryman
from
älvåkra
and
his
daughter
who
come
driving
back
there
gudmund
glanced
up
quickly
recognized
the
horse
and
made
a
movement
as
if
to
turn
back
but
the
next
instant
he
straightened
up
and
walked
calmly
at
helga
side
until
the
vehicle
had
passed
then
he
slackened
his
pace
helga
continued
to
walk
rapidly
and
they
parted
company
without
his
having
said
a
word
to
her
but
all
that
day
he
was
better
satisfied
with
himself
than
he
had
been
in
a
long
while
v
it
was
decided
that
gudmund
and
hildur
wedding
should
be
celebrated
at
älvåkra
the
day
following
palm
sunday
on
the
friday
before
gudmund
drove
to
town
to
make
some
purchases
for
the
banquet
which
was
to
be
held
at
närlunda
the
day
after
the
wedding
in
the
village
he
happened
across
a
number
of
young
men
from
his
parish
they
knew
it
was
his
last
trip
to
the
city
before
the
marriage
and
made
it
the
occasion
for
a
carouse
all
insisted
that
gudmund
must
drink
and
they
succeeded
finally
in
getting
him
thoroughly
intoxicated
he
came
home
on
saturday
morning
so
late
that
his
father
and
the
men
servants
had
already
gone
out
to
their
work
and
he
slept
on
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
arose
and
was
going
to
dress
himself
he
noticed
that
his
coat
was
torn
in
several
places
it
looks
as
though
i
had
been
in
a
fight
last
night
said
he
trying
to
recall
what
he
had
been
up
to
he
remembered
this
much
he
had
left
the
public
tavern
at
eleven
in
company
with
his
comrades
but
where
they
had
gone
afterwards
he
could
remember
it
was
like
trying
to
peer
into
a
great
darkness
he
did
not
know
if
they
had
only
driven
around
on
the
streets
or
if
they
had
been
in
somebody
home
he
did
remember
whether
he
or
some
one
else
had
harnessed
the
horse
and
had
no
recollection
whatever
of
the
drive
home
when
he
came
into
the
of
the
cottage
it
was
scoured
and
arranged
for
the
occasion
all
work
was
over
for
the
day
and
the
household
were
having
coffee
no
one
spoke
of
gudmund
trip
it
seemed
to
be
a
matter
agreed
upon
that
he
should
have
the
freedom
of
living
as
he
chose
these
last
weeks
gudmund
sat
down
at
the
table
and
had
his
coffee
like
the
others
as
he
sat
pouring
it
from
the
cup
into
the
saucer
and
back
into
the
cup
again
to
let
it
cool
mother
ingeborg
who
had
finished
with
hers
took
up
the
newspaper
which
had
just
arrived
and
began
reading
she
read
aloud
column
after
column
and
gudmund
his
father
and
the
rest
sat
and
listened
among
other
things
which
she
read
there
was
an
account
of
a
fight
that
had
taken
place
the
night
before
on
the
big
square
between
a
gang
of
drunken
farmers
and
some
laborers
as
soon
as
the
police
turned
up
the
fighters
fled
but
one
of
them
lay
dead
on
the
square
the
man
was
carried
to
the
police
station
and
when
no
outward
injury
was
found
on
him
they
had
tried
to
resuscitate
him
but
all
attempts
had
been
in
vain
and
at
last
they
discovered
that
a
was
imbedded
in
the
skull
it
was
the
blade
of
an
uncommonly
large
that
had
pierced
the
brain
and
was
broken
off
close
to
the
head
the
murderer
had
fled
with
the
but
as
the
police
knew
perfectly
well
who
had
been
in
the
fight
they
had
hopes
of
soon
finding
him
while
mother
ingeborg
was
reading
this
gudmund
set
down
the
stuck
his
hand
in
his
pocket
pulled
out
a
and
glanced
at
it
carelessly
but
almost
immediately
he
started
turned
the
knife
over
and
poked
it
into
his
pocket
as
quickly
as
though
it
had
burned
him
he
did
not
touch
the
coffee
after
that
but
sat
a
long
while
perfectly
still
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
his
brows
were
contracted
and
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
trying
with
all
his
might
to
think
out
something
finally
he
stood
up
stretched
himself
yawned
and
walked
leisurely
toward
the
door
i
have
to
bestir
myself
i
have
been
out
of
doors
all
day
he
said
leaving
the
room
about
the
same
time
erland
erlandsson
also
arose
he
had
smoked
out
his
pipe
and
now
he
went
into
the
side
room
to
get
some
tobacco
as
he
was
standing
in
there
refilling
his
pipe
he
saw
gudmund
walking
along
the
windows
of
the
side
room
did
not
like
those
of
the
main
room
face
the
yard
but
looked
out
upon
a
little
garden
plot
with
a
couple
of
tall
apple
trees
beyond
the
plot
lay
a
bit
of
swamp
land
where
in
the
spring
of
the
year
there
were
big
pools
of
water
but
which
were
almost
dried
out
in
the
summer
toward
this
side
it
was
seldom
that
any
one
went
erland
erlandsson
wondered
what
gudmund
was
doing
there
and
followed
him
with
his
eyes
then
he
saw
that
the
son
stuck
his
hand
into
his
pocket
drew
out
some
object
and
flung
it
away
in
the
morass
thereupon
he
walked
back
across
the
little
garden
plot
leaped
a
fence
and
went
down
the
road
as
soon
as
his
son
was
out
of
sight
erland
in
his
turn
betook
himself
as
he
should
have
done
to
the
swamp
he
waded
out
into
the
mire
bent
down
and
picked
up
something
his
foot
had
touched
it
was
a
large
with
the
biggest
blade
broken
off
he
turned
it
over
and
over
and
examined
it
carefully
while
he
still
stood
in
the
water
then
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
but
he
took
it
out
again
and
looked
at
it
before
returning
to
the
house
gudmund
did
not
come
home
until
the
household
had
retired
he
went
immediately
to
bed
without
touching
his
supper
which
was
spread
in
the
main
room
erland
erlandsson
and
his
wife
slept
in
the
side
room
at
daybreak
erland
thought
he
heard
footsteps
outside
the
window
he
got
up
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
saw
gudmund
walking
down
to
the
swamp
he
stripped
off
stockings
and
shoes
and
waded
out
into
the
water
tramping
back
and
forth
like
one
who
is
searching
for
something
he
kept
this
up
for
a
long
while
then
he
walked
back
to
dry
land
as
if
he
intended
to
go
away
but
soon
turned
back
to
resume
his
search
a
whole
hour
his
father
stood
watching
him
then
gudmund
went
back
to
the
house
again
and
to
bed
on
palm
sunday
gudmund
was
to
drive
to
church
as
he
started
to
hitch
up
the
horse
his
father
came
out
you
have
forgotten
to
polish
the
harness
he
said
as
he
walked
by
for
both
harness
and
cart
were
muddy
i
have
had
other
things
to
think
of
said
gudmund
listlessly
and
drove
off
without
doing
anything
in
the
matter
after
the
service
gudmund
accompanied
his
betrothed
to
älvåkra
and
remained
there
all
day
a
number
of
young
people
came
to
celebrate
hildur
last
evening
as
a
maid
and
there
was
dancing
till
far
into
the
night
intoxicants
were
plentiful
but
gudmund
did
not
touch
them
the
whole
evening
he
had
scarcely
spoken
a
word
to
any
one
but
he
danced
wildly
and
laughed
at
times
loudly
and
stridently
without
any
knowing
what
he
was
so
amused
over
gudmund
did
not
come
home
until
about
two
in
the
morning
and
when
he
had
stabled
the
horse
he
went
down
to
the
swamp
back
of
the
house
he
took
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
rolled
up
his
trousers
and
waded
into
the
water
and
mud
it
was
a
light
spring
night
and
his
father
was
standing
in
the
side
room
behind
the
curtain
watching
his
son
he
saw
how
he
walked
bending
over
the
water
and
searching
as
on
the
previous
night
he
went
up
on
land
between
times
but
after
a
moment
or
two
he
would
wade
again
through
the
mud
once
he
went
and
fetched
a
bucket
from
the
barn
and
began
dipping
water
from
the
pools
as
if
he
intended
to
drain
them
but
really
found
it
unprofitable
and
set
the
bucket
aside
he
tried
also
with
a
he
ploughed
through
the
entire
with
it
but
seemed
to
bring
up
nothing
but
mud
he
did
not
go
in
until
the
morning
was
so
well
on
that
the
people
in
the
house
were
beginning
to
bestir
themselves
then
he
was
so
tired
and
spent
that
he
staggered
as
he
walked
and
he
flung
himself
upon
the
bed
without
undressing
when
the
clock
struck
eight
his
father
came
and
waked
him
gudmund
lay
upon
the
bed
his
clothing
covered
with
mud
and
clay
but
his
father
did
not
ask
what
he
had
been
doing
he
simply
said
it
is
time
now
to
get
up
and
closed
the
door
after
a
while
gudmund
came
down
stairs
dressed
in
his
wedding
clothes
he
was
pale
and
his
eyes
wore
a
troubled
expression
but
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
look
so
handsome
his
features
were
as
if
illumined
by
an
inner
light
one
felt
that
one
was
looking
upon
something
no
longer
made
up
of
flesh
and
blood
only
of
soul
and
will
it
was
solemnly
ceremonious
down
in
the
main
room
his
mother
was
in
black
and
she
had
thrown
a
pretty
silk
shawl
across
her
shoulders
although
she
was
not
to
be
at
the
wedding
fresh
birch
leaves
were
arranged
in
the
fireplace
the
table
was
spread
and
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
food
when
they
had
breakfasted
mother
ingeborg
read
a
hymn
and
something
from
the
bible
then
she
turned
to
gudmund
thanked
him
for
having
been
a
good
son
wished
him
happiness
in
his
new
life
and
gave
him
her
blessing
mother
ingeborg
could
arrange
her
words
well
and
gudmund
was
deeply
moved
the
tears
welled
to
his
eyes
time
and
again
but
he
managed
to
choke
them
back
his
father
too
said
a
few
words
it
will
be
hard
for
your
parents
to
lose
you
he
said
and
again
gudmund
came
near
breaking
down
all
the
servants
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
thanked
him
for
the
past
tears
were
in
his
eyes
all
the
while
he
pulled
himself
together
and
made
several
attempts
to
speak
but
could
scarcely
get
a
word
past
his
lips
his
father
was
to
accompany
him
to
the
wedding
and
be
one
of
the
party
he
went
out
and
harnessed
the
horse
after
which
he
came
back
and
announced
that
it
was
time
to
start
when
gudmund
was
seated
in
the
cart
he
noticed
that
it
was
cleansed
and
burnished
everything
was
as
bright
and
shiny
as
he
himself
always
wished
it
to
be
at
the
same
time
he
saw
also
how
neat
everything
about
the
place
looked
the
driveway
had
been
laid
with
new
gravel
piles
of
old
wood
and
rubbish
which
had
lain
there
all
his
life
were
removed
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
door
stood
a
birch
branch
as
a
gate
of
honor
a
large
wreath
of
blueberry
hung
on
the
and
from
every
aperture
peeped
light
green
again
gudmund
was
ready
to
burst
into
tears
he
grasped
his
father
hand
hard
when
he
was
about
to
start
it
was
as
though
he
wished
to
prevent
his
going
is
there
something
said
the
father
oh
no
said
gudmund
it
is
best
i
dare
say
that
we
go
ahead
gudmund
had
to
say
one
more
farewell
before
he
was
very
far
from
the
homestead
it
was
helga
from
big
marsh
who
stood
waiting
at
the
hedge
where
the
foliage
path
leading
from
her
home
opened
into
the
highway
the
father
was
driving
and
stopped
when
he
saw
helga
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
as
i
wanted
to
wish
you
happiness
said
helga
gudmund
leaned
far
out
over
the
cart
and
shook
hands
with
helga
he
thought
that
she
had
grown
thin
and
that
her
eyelids
were
red
very
probably
she
had
lain
awake
and
cried
all
night
and
was
homesick
for
närlunda
but
now
she
tried
to
appear
happy
and
smiled
sweetly
at
him
again
he
felt
deeply
moved
but
could
not
speak
his
father
who
was
reputed
never
to
speak
a
word
until
it
was
called
forth
by
extreme
necessity
joined
in
that
good
wish
i
think
gudmund
will
be
more
glad
over
than
any
other
yes
of
that
you
may
be
sure
said
gudmund
he
shook
hands
with
helga
once
more
and
then
they
drove
on
gudmund
leaned
back
in
the
cart
and
looked
after
helga
when
she
was
hidden
from
view
by
a
couple
of
trees
he
hastily
tore
aside
the
apron
of
the
carriage
as
if
he
wished
to
jump
out
is
there
anything
more
you
wish
to
say
to
helga
asked
his
father
no
oh
no
answered
gudmund
and
turned
round
again
suddenly
gudmund
leaned
his
head
against
his
father
shoulder
and
burst
out
crying
what
ails
you
asked
erland
erlandsson
drawing
in
the
reins
so
suddenly
that
the
horse
stopped
oh
they
are
all
so
good
to
me
and
i
do
deserve
it
but
you
have
never
done
anything
wrong
surely
yes
father
i
have
that
we
ca
believe
i
have
killed
a
human
being
the
father
drew
a
deep
breath
it
sounded
almost
like
a
sigh
of
relief
and
gudmund
raised
his
head
astonished
and
looked
at
him
his
father
set
the
horse
in
motion
again
then
he
said
calmly
i
glad
you
have
told
of
this
yourself
did
you
know
it
already
father
i
surmised
last
saturday
evening
that
there
was
something
wrong
and
then
i
found
your
knife
down
in
the
morass
so
it
was
you
who
found
the
knife
i
found
it
and
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
blades
had
been
broken
off
yes
father
i
aware
that
the
is
gone
but
still
i
can
not
get
it
into
my
head
that
i
did
it
it
was
probably
done
in
the
drunkenness
and
delirium
i
know
nothing
i
remember
nothing
i
could
see
by
my
clothes
that
i
had
been
in
a
fight
and
i
knew
that
the
was
missing
i
understand
that
it
was
your
intention
to
be
silent
about
this
said
the
father
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
rest
of
the
party
were
as
irresponsible
as
myself
and
could
remember
anything
there
was
perhaps
no
other
evidence
against
me
than
the
knife
therefore
i
threw
it
away
i
comprehend
that
you
must
have
reasoned
in
that
way
you
understand
father
that
i
do
not
know
who
is
dead
i
had
never
seen
him
before
i
dare
say
i
have
no
recollection
of
having
done
it
i
did
think
i
ought
to
suffer
for
what
i
had
not
done
knowingly
but
soon
i
got
to
thinking
that
i
must
have
been
mad
to
throw
the
knife
into
the
marsh
it
dries
out
in
summer
and
then
any
one
might
find
it
i
tried
last
night
and
the
night
before
to
find
it
did
it
occur
to
you
that
you
should
confess
no
yesterday
i
thought
only
of
how
i
could
keep
it
a
secret
and
i
tried
to
dance
and
be
merry
so
that
no
one
would
mark
any
change
in
me
was
it
your
intention
to
go
to
the
bridal
altar
without
confessing
you
were
assuming
a
grave
responsibility
did
you
understand
that
if
you
were
discovered
you
would
drag
hildur
and
her
kin
with
you
into
misery
i
thought
that
i
was
sparing
them
most
by
saying
nothing
they
drove
now
as
fast
as
possible
the
father
seemed
to
be
in
haste
to
arrive
and
all
the
time
he
talked
with
his
son
he
had
not
said
so
much
to
him
in
all
his
life
before
i
wonder
how
you
came
to
think
differently
said
he
it
was
because
helga
came
and
wished
me
luck
then
there
was
something
hard
in
me
that
broke
i
was
touched
by
something
in
her
mother
also
moved
me
this
morning
and
i
wanted
to
speak
out
and
tell
her
that
i
was
not
worthy
of
your
love
but
then
the
hardness
was
still
within
me
and
made
resistance
but
when
helga
appeared
it
was
all
over
with
me
i
felt
that
she
really
ought
to
be
angry
with
me
who
was
to
blame
for
her
having
to
leave
our
home
now
i
think
you
are
agreed
with
me
that
we
must
let
the
juryman
know
this
at
once
said
the
father
yes
answered
gudmund
in
a
low
tone
why
certainly
he
added
almost
immediately
after
louder
and
firmer
i
do
want
to
drag
hildur
into
my
misfortune
this
she
would
never
forgive
me
the
älvåkra
folk
are
jealous
of
their
honor
like
the
rest
remarked
the
father
and
you
may
as
well
know
gudmund
that
when
i
left
home
this
morning
i
was
thinking
that
i
must
tell
the
juryman
your
position
if
you
did
not
decide
to
do
so
yourself
i
never
could
have
stood
silently
by
and
let
hildur
marry
a
man
who
at
any
moment
might
be
accused
of
murder
he
cracked
the
whip
and
drove
on
faster
and
faster
this
will
be
the
hardest
thing
for
you
said
he
but
we
try
and
have
it
over
with
quickly
i
believe
that
to
the
juryman
mind
it
will
be
right
for
you
to
give
yourself
up
and
they
will
be
kind
to
you
no
doubt
gudmund
said
nothing
his
torture
increased
the
nearer
they
approached
älvåkra
the
father
continued
talking
to
keep
up
his
courage
i
have
heard
something
of
this
sort
before
said
he
there
was
a
bridegroom
once
who
happened
to
shoot
a
comrade
to
death
during
a
hunt
he
did
not
do
it
intentionally
and
it
was
not
discovered
that
he
was
the
one
who
had
fired
the
fatal
shot
but
a
day
or
two
later
he
was
to
be
married
and
when
he
came
to
the
home
of
the
bride
he
went
to
her
and
said
marriage
can
not
take
place
i
do
not
care
to
drag
you
into
the
misery
which
awaits
me
but
she
stood
dressed
in
bridal
wreath
and
crown
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
the
where
the
guests
were
assembled
and
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
ceremony
she
related
in
a
clear
voice
what
the
bridegroom
had
just
said
to
her
have
told
of
this
that
all
may
know
you
have
practised
no
deceit
on
me
then
she
turned
to
the
bridegroom
i
want
to
be
married
to
you
at
once
you
are
what
you
are
even
though
you
have
met
with
misfortune
and
whatever
awaits
you
i
want
to
share
it
equally
with
you
just
as
the
father
had
finished
the
narrative
they
were
on
the
long
avenue
leading
to
älvåkra
gudmund
turned
to
him
with
a
melancholy
smile
it
will
not
end
thus
for
us
he
said
who
knows
said
the
father
straightening
in
the
cart
he
looked
upon
his
son
and
was
again
astonished
at
his
beauty
this
day
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
something
great
and
unexpected
were
to
come
to
him
thought
he
there
was
to
have
been
a
church
ceremony
and
already
a
crowd
of
people
were
gathered
at
the
bride
home
to
join
in
the
wedding
procession
a
number
of
the
juryman
relatives
from
a
distance
had
also
arrived
they
were
sitting
on
the
porch
in
their
best
attire
ready
for
the
drive
to
church
carts
and
carriages
were
strung
out
in
the
yard
and
one
could
hear
the
horses
stamping
in
the
stable
as
they
were
being
curried
the
parish
fiddler
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
storehouse
alone
tuning
his
fiddle
at
a
window
in
the
upper
story
of
the
cottage
stood
the
bride
dressed
and
waiting
to
have
a
peep
at
the
bridegroom
before
he
had
time
to
discover
her
erland
and
gudmund
stepped
from
the
carriage
and
asked
immediately
for
a
private
conference
with
hildur
and
her
parents
soon
they
were
all
standing
in
the
little
room
which
the
juryman
used
as
his
study
i
think
you
must
have
read
in
the
papers
of
that
fight
in
town
last
saturday
night
where
a
man
was
killed
said
gudmund
as
rapidly
as
if
he
were
repeating
a
lesson
oh
yes
i
read
about
it
of
course
said
the
juryman
i
happened
to
be
in
town
that
night
continued
gudmund
now
there
was
no
response
it
was
as
still
as
death
gudmund
thought
they
all
glared
at
him
with
such
fury
that
he
was
unable
to
continue
but
his
father
came
to
his
aid
gudmund
had
been
invited
out
by
a
few
friends
he
had
probably
drunk
too
much
that
night
and
when
he
came
home
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
been
doing
but
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
been
in
a
fight
for
his
clothes
were
torn
gudmund
saw
that
the
dread
which
the
others
felt
increased
with
every
word
that
was
said
but
he
himself
was
growing
calmer
there
awoke
in
him
a
sense
of
defiance
and
he
took
up
the
words
again
when
the
paper
came
on
saturday
evening
and
i
read
of
the
fight
and
of
the
which
was
imbedded
in
the
man
skull
i
took
out
my
knife
and
saw
that
a
blade
was
missing
it
is
bad
news
that
gudmund
brings
with
him
said
the
juryman
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
told
us
of
this
yesterday
gudmund
was
silent
and
now
his
father
came
to
the
rescue
again
it
was
not
so
easy
for
gudmund
it
was
a
great
temptation
to
keep
quiet
about
the
whole
affair
he
is
losing
much
by
this
confession
we
may
be
glad
that
he
has
spoken
now
and
that
we
have
not
been
tricked
and
dragged
into
this
wretched
affair
said
the
juryman
bitterly
gudmund
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
hildur
all
the
while
she
was
adorned
with
veil
and
crown
and
now
he
saw
how
she
raised
her
hand
and
drew
out
one
of
the
large
pins
which
held
the
crown
in
place
she
seemed
to
do
this
unconsciously
when
she
observed
that
gudmund
glance
rested
upon
her
she
stuck
the
pin
in
again
it
is
not
yet
fully
proved
that
gudmund
is
the
slayer
said
his
father
but
i
can
well
understand
that
you
wish
the
wedding
postponed
until
everything
has
been
cleared
up
it
is
not
worth
while
to
talk
of
postponement
said
the
juryman
i
think
that
gudmund
case
is
clear
enough
for
us
to
decide
that
all
is
over
between
him
and
hildur
now
gudmund
did
not
at
once
reply
to
this
judgment
he
walked
over
to
his
betrothed
and
put
out
his
hand
she
sat
perfectly
still
and
seemed
not
to
see
him
wo
you
say
farewell
to
me
hildur
then
she
looked
up
and
her
large
eyes
stared
coldly
at
him
was
it
with
that
hand
you
guided
the
knife
she
asked
gudmund
did
not
answer
her
but
turned
to
the
juryman
now
i
am
sure
of
my
case
he
said
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
a
wedding
with
this
the
conference
was
ended
and
gudmund
and
erland
went
their
way
they
had
to
pass
through
a
number
of
rooms
and
corridors
before
they
came
out
and
everywhere
they
saw
preparations
for
the
wedding
the
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
was
open
and
they
saw
many
bustling
about
in
eager
haste
the
smell
of
roasts
and
of
baking
penetrated
the
air
the
whole
fireplace
was
covered
with
large
and
small
pots
and
pans
and
the
copper
saucepans
which
usually
decorated
the
walls
were
down
and
in
use
fancy
it
is
for
my
wedding
that
they
are
puttering
like
this
thought
gudmund
as
he
was
passing
he
caught
a
glimpse
so
to
speak
of
all
the
wealth
of
this
old
peasant
estate
as
he
wandered
through
the
house
he
saw
the
where
the
long
tables
were
set
with
a
long
row
of
silver
goblets
and
decanters
he
passed
by
the
where
the
floor
was
covered
with
great
chests
and
where
the
walls
were
hung
with
an
endless
array
of
wearing
apparel
when
he
came
out
in
the
yard
he
saw
many
vehicles
old
and
new
and
fine
horses
being
led
out
from
the
stable
and
gorgeous
carriage
robes
placed
in
the
carriages
he
looked
out
across
a
couple
of
farms
with
barns
storehouses
sheds
larders
and
many
other
buildings
all
this
might
have
been
mine
he
thought
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
cart
suddenly
he
was
seized
with
a
sense
of
bitter
regret
he
would
have
liked
to
throw
himself
out
of
the
cart
and
go
in
and
say
that
what
he
had
told
them
was
not
true
he
had
only
wished
to
joke
with
them
and
frighten
them
it
was
awfully
stupid
of
him
to
confess
of
what
use
had
it
been
to
him
to
confess
the
dead
was
dead
no
this
confession
carried
nothing
with
it
save
his
ruin
these
last
weeks
he
had
not
been
very
enthusiastic
over
this
marriage
but
now
when
he
must
renounce
it
he
realized
what
it
was
worth
to
him
it
meant
much
to
lose
hildur
ericsdotter
and
all
that
went
with
her
what
did
it
matter
that
she
was
domineering
and
opinionated
she
was
still
the
peer
of
all
in
these
regions
and
through
her
he
would
have
come
by
great
power
and
honor
it
was
not
only
hildur
and
her
possessions
he
was
missing
but
minor
things
as
well
at
this
moment
he
should
have
been
driving
to
the
church
and
all
who
looked
upon
him
would
have
envied
him
and
it
was
that
he
should
have
sat
at
the
head
of
the
wedding
table
and
been
in
the
thick
of
the
dancing
and
the
gayety
it
was
his
great
that
was
going
from
him
erland
turned
time
and
again
to
his
son
and
looked
at
him
now
he
was
not
so
handsome
or
transfigured
as
he
had
been
in
the
morning
but
sat
there
listless
and
heavy
and
the
father
wondered
if
the
son
regretted
having
confessed
and
meant
to
question
him
about
it
but
thought
it
best
to
be
silent
where
are
we
driving
to
now
asked
gudmund
presently
would
it
be
as
well
to
go
at
once
to
the
sheriff
you
had
better
go
home
first
and
have
a
good
sleep
said
the
father
you
have
not
had
much
sleep
these
last
nights
i
dare
say
mother
will
be
frightened
when
she
sees
us
she
wo
be
surprised
answered
the
father
for
she
knows
quite
as
much
as
i
do
she
will
be
glad
of
course
that
you
have
confessed
i
believe
mother
and
the
rest
of
you
at
home
are
glad
to
get
me
into
prison
snarled
gudmund
we
know
that
you
are
losing
a
good
deal
in
acting
rightly
said
the
father
we
ca
help
but
be
glad
because
you
have
conquered
yourself
gudmund
felt
that
he
could
not
endure
going
home
and
having
to
listen
to
all
who
would
commend
him
because
he
had
spoiled
his
future
he
sought
some
excuse
that
he
might
escape
meeting
any
one
until
he
had
recovered
his
poise
then
they
drove
by
the
place
where
the
path
led
to
big
marsh
will
you
stop
here
father
i
think
i
run
up
to
see
helga
and
have
a
talk
with
her
willingly
the
father
reined
in
the
horse
only
come
home
as
quickly
as
you
can
that
you
may
rest
yourself
said
he
gudmund
went
into
the
woods
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
he
did
not
think
of
seeking
helga
he
was
only
thinking
of
being
alone
so
that
he
would
have
to
control
himself
he
felt
an
unreasonable
anger
toward
everything
kicked
at
stones
that
lay
in
his
path
and
paused
sometimes
to
break
off
a
big
branch
only
because
a
leaf
had
brushed
his
cheek
he
followed
the
path
to
big
marsh
but
walked
past
the
croft
and
up
the
hill
which
lay
above
it
he
had
wandered
off
the
path
and
in
order
to
reach
the
he
must
cross
a
broad
ridge
of
sharp
jagged
rocks
it
was
a
hazardous
tramp
over
the
sharp
rock
edges
he
might
have
broken
both
arms
and
legs
had
he
made
a
misstep
he
understood
this
perfectly
but
went
on
as
if
it
amused
him
to
run
into
danger
if
i
were
to
fall
and
hurt
myself
no
one
can
find
me
up
here
thought
he
what
of
it
i
may
as
well
die
here
as
to
sit
for
years
within
prison
walls
all
went
well
however
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
up
on
high
peak
once
a
forest
fire
had
swept
the
mountain
the
highest
point
was
still
bare
and
from
there
one
had
a
outlook
he
saw
valleys
and
lakes
dark
forest
tracts
and
flourishing
towns
churches
and
manors
little
woodland
crofts
and
large
villages
far
in
the
distance
lay
the
city
enveloped
in
a
white
haze
from
which
a
pair
of
gleaming
spires
peeped
out
public
roads
wound
through
the
valleys
and
a
railway
train
was
rushing
along
the
border
of
the
forest
it
was
a
whole
kingdom
that
he
saw
he
flung
himself
upon
the
ground
all
the
while
keeping
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
vast
outlook
there
was
something
grand
and
majestic
about
the
landscape
before
him
which
made
him
feel
himself
and
his
sorrows
small
and
insignificant
he
remembered
how
when
a
child
he
had
read
that
the
tempter
led
jesus
up
to
a
high
mountain
and
showed
him
all
the
world
glories
and
he
always
fancied
that
they
had
stood
up
here
on
great
peak
and
he
repeated
the
old
words
all
these
things
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
thinking
that
a
similar
temptation
had
come
to
him
these
last
days
certainly
the
tempter
had
not
borne
him
to
a
high
mountain
and
shown
him
all
the
glories
and
powers
of
this
world
only
be
silent
about
the
evil
which
you
think
you
have
done
said
he
and
i
will
give
you
all
these
things
as
gudmund
thought
on
this
a
grain
of
satisfaction
came
to
him
i
have
answered
no
he
said
and
suddenly
he
understood
what
it
had
meant
for
him
if
he
had
kept
silent
would
he
not
have
been
compelled
to
worship
the
tempter
all
his
life
he
would
have
been
a
timid
and
man
simply
a
slave
to
his
possessions
the
fear
of
discovery
would
always
have
weighed
upon
him
nevermore
would
he
have
felt
himself
a
free
man
a
great
peace
came
over
gudmund
he
was
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
he
had
done
right
when
he
thought
back
to
the
past
days
he
felt
that
he
had
groped
his
way
out
of
a
great
darkness
it
was
wonderful
that
he
had
come
out
right
finally
he
asked
himself
how
he
had
ever
happened
to
go
astray
it
was
because
they
were
so
kind
to
me
at
home
he
thought
and
the
best
help
was
that
helga
came
and
wished
me
happiness
he
lay
up
there
on
the
mountain
a
little
longer
but
presently
he
felt
that
he
must
go
home
to
his
father
and
mother
and
tell
them
that
he
was
at
peace
with
himself
when
he
rose
to
go
he
saw
helga
sitting
on
a
ledge
a
little
farther
down
the
mountain
where
she
sat
she
had
not
the
big
broad
outlook
which
he
enjoyed
only
a
little
glint
of
the
valley
was
visible
to
her
this
was
in
the
direction
where
närlunda
lay
and
possibly
she
could
see
a
portion
of
the
farm
when
gudmund
discovered
her
he
felt
that
his
heart
which
all
the
day
before
had
labored
heavily
and
anxiously
began
to
beat
lightly
and
merrily
at
the
same
time
such
a
thrill
of
joy
ran
through
him
that
he
stood
still
and
marvelled
at
himself
what
has
come
over
me
what
is
this
he
wondered
as
the
blood
surged
through
his
body
and
happiness
gripped
him
with
a
force
that
was
almost
painful
at
last
he
said
to
himself
in
a
surprised
tone
why
it
is
she
that
i
fond
of
think
that
i
did
not
know
it
until
now
it
took
hold
of
him
with
the
strength
of
a
loosened
torrent
he
had
been
bound
the
whole
time
he
knew
her
all
that
had
drawn
him
to
her
he
had
held
back
now
at
last
he
was
freed
from
the
thought
of
marrying
some
one
else
free
to
love
her
helga
he
cried
rushing
down
the
steep
to
her
she
turned
round
with
a
terrified
shriek
do
be
frightened
it
is
only
i
but
are
you
not
at
church
being
married
no
indeed
there
will
be
no
wedding
she
does
want
me
she
hildur
helga
rose
she
placed
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
closed
her
eyes
at
that
moment
she
must
have
thought
it
was
not
gudmund
who
had
come
it
must
be
that
her
eyes
and
ears
were
bewitched
in
the
forest
yet
it
was
sweet
and
dear
of
him
to
come
if
only
in
a
vision
she
closed
her
eyes
and
stood
motionless
to
keep
this
vision
a
few
seconds
longer
gudmund
was
wild
and
dizzy
from
the
great
love
that
had
flamed
up
in
him
as
soon
as
he
came
down
to
helga
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
and
she
let
it
happen
for
she
was
absolutely
stupefied
with
surprise
it
was
too
wonderful
to
believe
that
he
who
should
now
be
standing
in
church
beside
his
bride
actually
could
have
come
here
to
the
forest
this
phantom
or
ghost
of
him
that
had
come
to
her
may
as
well
kiss
her
but
while
gudmund
was
kissing
helga
she
awoke
and
pushed
him
from
her
she
began
to
shower
him
with
questions
was
it
really
he
what
was
he
doing
in
the
forest
had
any
misfortune
happened
to
him
why
was
the
wedding
postponed
was
hildur
ill
did
the
clergyman
have
a
stroke
in
church
gudmund
had
not
wished
to
talk
to
her
of
anything
in
the
world
save
his
love
but
she
forced
him
to
tell
her
what
had
occurred
while
he
was
speaking
she
sat
still
and
listened
with
rapt
attention
she
did
not
interrupt
him
until
he
mentioned
the
broken
blade
then
she
leaped
up
suddenly
and
asked
if
it
was
his
the
one
he
had
when
she
served
with
them
yes
it
was
just
that
one
said
he
how
many
blades
were
broken
off
she
asked
only
one
he
answered
then
helga
head
began
working
she
sat
with
knit
brows
trying
to
recall
something
wait
why
certainly
she
remembered
distinctly
that
she
had
borrowed
the
knife
from
him
to
shave
wood
with
the
day
before
she
left
she
had
broken
it
then
but
she
had
never
told
him
of
it
he
had
avoided
her
and
at
that
time
he
had
not
wished
to
hold
any
converse
with
her
and
of
course
the
knife
had
been
in
his
pocket
ever
since
and
he
had
noticed
that
it
was
broken
she
raised
her
head
and
was
about
to
tell
him
of
this
but
he
went
on
talking
of
his
visit
that
morning
to
the
house
where
the
wedding
was
to
have
been
celebrated
and
she
wanted
to
let
him
finish
when
she
heard
how
he
had
parted
from
hildur
she
thought
it
such
a
terrible
misfortune
that
she
began
upbraiding
him
this
is
your
own
fault
said
she
you
and
your
father
came
and
frightened
the
life
out
of
her
with
the
shocking
news
she
would
not
have
answered
thus
had
she
been
mistress
of
herself
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
i
believe
she
regrets
it
at
this
very
moment
let
her
regret
it
as
much
as
she
likes
for
all
of
me
said
gudmund
i
know
now
that
she
is
the
sort
who
thinks
only
of
herself
i
am
glad
i
rid
of
her
helga
pressed
her
lips
as
if
to
keep
the
great
secret
from
escaping
there
was
much
for
her
to
think
about
it
was
more
than
a
question
of
clearing
gudmund
of
the
murder
the
wretched
affair
had
also
dragged
with
it
enmity
between
gudmund
and
his
sweetheart
perhaps
she
might
try
to
adjust
this
matter
with
the
help
of
what
she
knew
again
she
sat
silent
and
pondered
until
gudmund
began
telling
that
he
had
transferred
his
affections
to
her
but
to
her
this
seemed
to
be
the
greatest
misfortune
he
had
met
with
that
day
it
was
bad
that
he
was
about
to
miss
the
advantageous
marriage
but
still
worse
were
he
to
woo
a
girl
like
herself
no
such
things
you
must
not
say
to
me
she
said
rising
abruptly
why
should
i
say
this
to
you
asked
gudmund
turning
pale
perhaps
it
is
with
you
as
with
hildur
you
are
afraid
of
me
no
that
not
the
reason
she
wanted
to
explain
how
he
was
seeking
his
own
ruin
but
he
was
not
listening
to
her
i
have
heard
said
that
there
were
in
olden
times
who
stood
side
by
side
with
men
when
they
were
in
trouble
but
that
kind
one
does
not
encounter
nowadays
a
tremor
passed
through
helga
she
could
have
thrown
her
arms
around
his
neck
but
remained
perfectly
still
it
was
she
who
must
be
sensible
true
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
become
my
wife
on
the
day
that
i
must
go
to
prison
you
see
if
i
only
knew
that
you
would
wait
for
me
until
i
free
again
i
should
go
through
all
the
hardship
with
courage
every
one
will
now
regard
me
as
a
criminal
as
one
who
drinks
and
murders
if
only
there
were
some
one
who
could
think
of
me
with
affection
this
would
sustain
me
more
than
anything
else
you
know
surely
that
i
shall
never
think
anything
but
good
of
you
gudmund
helga
was
so
still
gudmund
entreaties
were
becoming
almost
too
much
for
her
she
did
know
how
she
should
escape
him
he
apprehended
nothing
of
this
but
began
thinking
he
had
been
mistaken
she
could
not
feel
toward
him
as
he
did
toward
her
he
came
very
close
and
looked
at
her
as
though
he
wanted
to
look
through
her
are
you
not
sitting
on
this
particular
ledge
of
the
mountain
that
you
may
look
down
to
närlunda
yes
do
you
long
night
and
day
to
be
there
yes
but
i
not
longing
for
any
person
and
you
do
care
for
me
yes
but
i
do
want
to
marry
you
whom
do
you
care
for
then
helga
was
silent
is
it
per
mårtensson
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
liked
him
she
said
exhausted
by
the
strain
of
it
all
gudmund
stood
for
a
moment
with
tense
features
and
looked
at
her
farewell
then
now
we
must
go
our
separate
ways
you
and
i
said
he
with
that
he
made
a
long
jump
from
this
ledge
of
the
mountain
down
to
the
next
landing
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
vi
gudmund
was
hardly
out
of
sight
when
helga
rushed
down
the
mountain
in
another
direction
she
ran
past
the
marsh
without
stopping
and
hurried
over
the
wooded
hills
as
fast
as
she
could
and
down
the
road
she
stopped
at
the
first
farmhouse
she
came
to
and
asked
for
the
loan
of
a
horse
and
car
to
drive
to
älvåkra
she
said
that
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
promised
to
pay
for
the
help
the
church
folk
had
already
returned
to
their
homes
and
were
talking
of
the
adjourned
wedding
they
were
all
very
much
excited
and
very
solicitous
and
were
eager
to
help
helga
since
she
appeared
to
have
an
important
errand
to
the
home
of
the
bride
at
älvåkra
hildur
ericsdotter
sat
in
a
little
room
on
the
upper
floor
where
she
had
dressed
as
a
bride
her
mother
and
several
other
peasant
women
were
with
her
hildur
did
not
weep
she
was
unusually
quiet
and
so
pale
that
she
looked
as
though
she
might
be
ill
at
any
moment
the
women
talked
all
the
while
of
gudmund
all
blamed
him
and
seemed
to
regard
it
as
a
fortunate
thing
that
she
was
rid
of
him
some
thought
that
gudmund
had
shown
very
little
consideration
for
his
in
not
letting
them
know
on
palm
sunday
how
matters
stood
with
him
others
again
said
that
one
who
had
had
such
happiness
awaiting
him
should
have
known
how
to
take
better
care
of
himself
a
few
congratulated
hildur
because
she
had
escaped
marrying
a
man
who
could
drink
himself
so
full
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
amid
this
hildur
was
losing
her
patience
and
rose
to
go
out
as
soon
as
she
was
outside
the
door
her
best
friend
a
young
peasant
girl
came
and
whispered
something
to
her
there
is
some
one
below
who
wants
to
speak
with
you
is
it
gudmund
asked
hildur
and
a
spark
of
life
came
into
her
eyes
no
but
it
may
be
a
messenger
from
him
she
would
divulge
the
nature
of
her
errand
to
any
one
but
yourself
she
declared
hildur
had
been
sitting
thinking
all
day
that
some
one
must
come
who
could
put
an
end
to
her
misery
she
could
comprehend
that
such
a
dreadful
misfortune
should
come
to
her
she
felt
that
something
ought
to
happen
that
she
might
again
don
her
crown
and
wreath
so
they
could
proceed
with
the
wedding
when
she
heard
now
of
a
messenger
from
gudmund
she
was
interested
and
immediately
went
out
to
the
kitchen
hall
and
looked
for
her
hildur
probably
wondered
why
gudmund
had
sent
helga
to
her
but
she
thought
that
perhaps
he
could
find
any
other
messenger
on
a
holiday
and
greeted
her
pleasantly
she
motioned
to
helga
to
come
with
her
into
the
dairy
across
the
yard
i
know
no
other
place
where
we
can
be
alone
she
said
the
house
is
still
full
of
guests
as
soon
as
they
were
inside
helga
went
close
up
to
hildur
and
looked
her
square
in
the
face
before
i
say
anything
more
i
must
know
if
you
love
gudmund
hildur
winced
it
was
painful
for
her
to
be
obliged
to
exchange
a
single
word
with
helga
and
she
had
no
desire
to
make
a
confidant
of
her
but
now
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
and
she
forced
herself
to
answer
why
else
do
you
suppose
i
wished
to
marry
him
i
mean
do
you
still
love
him
hildur
was
like
stone
but
she
could
not
lie
under
the
other
searching
glance
perhaps
i
have
never
loved
him
so
much
as
she
said
but
she
said
this
so
feebly
that
one
might
think
it
hurt
her
to
speak
out
then
come
with
me
at
once
said
helga
i
have
a
wagon
down
the
road
go
in
after
a
cloak
or
something
to
wrap
around
you
then
we
drive
to
närlunda
what
good
would
it
do
for
me
to
go
there
asked
hildur
you
must
go
there
and
say
you
want
to
be
gudmund
no
matter
what
he
may
have
done
and
that
you
will
wait
faithfully
for
him
while
he
is
in
prison
why
should
i
say
this
so
all
will
be
well
between
you
but
that
is
impossible
i
do
want
to
marry
any
one
who
has
been
in
prison
helga
staggered
back
as
though
she
had
bumped
against
a
wall
but
she
quickly
regained
her
courage
she
could
understand
that
one
who
was
rich
and
powerful
like
hildur
must
think
thus
i
should
not
come
and
ask
you
to
go
to
närlunda
did
i
not
know
that
gudmund
was
innocent
said
she
now
it
was
hildur
who
came
a
step
or
two
towards
helga
do
you
know
this
for
certain
or
is
it
only
something
which
you
imagine
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
get
into
the
cart
immediately
then
i
can
talk
on
the
way
no
you
must
first
explain
what
you
mean
i
must
know
what
i
doing
helga
was
in
such
a
fever
of
excitement
that
she
could
hardly
stand
still
nevertheless
she
had
to
make
up
her
mind
to
tell
hildur
how
she
happened
to
know
that
gudmund
was
not
the
murderer
did
you
tell
gudmund
of
this
at
once
no
i
telling
it
now
to
hildur
no
one
else
knows
of
it
and
why
do
you
come
to
me
with
this
that
all
may
be
well
between
you
two
he
will
soon
learn
that
he
has
done
no
wrong
but
i
want
you
to
go
to
him
as
if
of
your
own
accord
and
make
it
up
i
say
that
i
know
he
is
innocent
you
must
come
entirely
of
your
own
accord
and
must
never
let
him
know
i
have
spoken
to
you
otherwise
he
will
never
forgive
you
for
what
you
said
to
him
this
morning
hildur
listened
quietly
there
was
something
in
this
which
she
had
never
met
with
in
her
life
before
and
she
was
striving
to
make
it
clear
to
herself
do
you
know
that
it
was
i
who
wanted
you
to
leave
närlunda
i
know
of
course
that
it
was
not
the
folk
at
närlunda
who
wished
me
away
i
ca
comprehend
that
you
should
come
to
me
with
the
desire
to
help
me
only
come
along
now
hildur
so
all
will
be
well
hildur
stared
at
helga
trying
all
the
while
to
reason
it
out
perhaps
gudmund
loves
you
she
blurted
out
and
now
helga
patience
was
exhausted
what
could
i
be
to
him
she
said
sharply
you
know
hildur
that
i
am
only
a
poor
croft
girl
and
that
not
the
worst
about
me
the
two
young
women
stole
unobserved
from
the
homestead
and
were
soon
seated
in
the
cart
helga
held
the
reins
and
she
did
not
spare
the
horse
but
drove
at
full
speed
both
girls
were
silent
hildur
sat
gazing
at
helga
she
marvelled
at
her
and
was
thinking
more
of
her
than
of
anything
else
as
they
were
nearing
the
erlandsson
farm
helga
gave
the
reins
to
hildur
now
you
must
go
alone
to
the
house
and
talk
with
gudmund
follow
a
little
later
and
tell
that
about
the
knife
but
you
must
say
a
word
to
gudmund
about
my
having
brought
you
here
gudmund
sat
in
the
at
närlunda
beside
his
mother
and
talked
with
her
his
father
was
sitting
a
little
way
from
them
smoking
he
looked
pleased
and
said
not
a
word
it
was
apparent
that
he
thought
everything
was
going
now
as
it
should
and
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
interfere
i
wonder
mother
what
you
would
have
said
if
you
had
got
helga
for
a
ventured
gudmund
mother
ingeborg
raised
her
head
and
said
in
a
firm
voice
i
will
with
pleasure
welcome
any
if
i
only
know
that
she
loves
you
as
a
wife
should
love
her
husband
this
was
barely
spoken
when
they
saw
hildur
ericsdotter
drive
into
the
yard
she
came
immediately
into
the
cottage
and
was
unlike
herself
in
many
respects
she
did
not
step
into
the
room
with
her
usual
briskness
but
it
appeared
almost
as
though
she
were
inclined
to
pause
near
the
door
like
some
poor
beggarwoman
however
she
came
forward
finally
and
shook
hands
with
mother
ingeborg
and
erland
then
she
turned
to
gudmund
it
is
with
you
that
i
would
have
a
word
or
two
gudmund
arose
and
they
went
into
the
side
room
he
arranged
a
chair
for
hildur
but
she
did
not
seat
herself
she
blushed
with
embarrassment
and
the
words
dropped
slowly
and
heavily
from
her
lips
i
was
yes
it
was
much
too
hard
that
which
i
said
to
you
this
morning
we
came
so
abruptly
hildur
said
gudmund
she
grew
still
more
red
and
embarrassed
i
should
have
thought
twice
we
could
it
would
of
course
it
is
probably
best
as
it
is
hildur
it
is
nothing
to
speak
of
now
but
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
drew
a
breath
as
deep
as
a
sigh
then
raised
her
head
again
no
she
said
i
ca
do
it
in
this
way
i
do
want
you
to
think
that
i
better
than
i
am
there
was
some
one
who
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
you
were
not
guilty
and
advised
me
to
hurry
over
here
at
once
and
make
everything
right
again
and
i
was
not
to
mention
that
i
already
knew
you
were
innocent
for
then
you
would
think
it
so
noble
of
me
to
come
now
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
this
myself
but
i
had
but
i
have
longed
for
you
all
day
and
wished
that
all
might
be
well
between
us
whichever
way
it
turns
out
i
want
to
say
that
i
am
glad
you
are
innocent
who
advised
you
to
do
this
asked
gudmund
i
was
not
to
tell
you
that
i
am
surprised
that
any
one
should
know
of
it
father
has
but
just
returned
from
the
sheriff
he
telegraphed
to
the
city
and
an
answer
has
come
that
the
real
murderer
has
already
been
found
as
gudmund
was
relating
this
hildur
felt
that
her
legs
were
beginning
to
shake
and
she
sat
down
quickly
in
the
chair
she
was
frightened
because
gudmund
was
so
calm
and
pleasant
and
she
was
beginning
to
perceive
that
he
was
wholly
out
of
her
power
i
can
understand
that
you
can
never
forget
how
i
behaved
to
you
this
forenoon
surely
i
can
forgive
you
that
he
said
in
the
same
even
tone
we
will
never
speak
of
the
matter
again
she
shivered
dropped
her
eyes
and
sat
as
though
she
were
expecting
something
it
was
simply
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
hildur
he
said
coming
forward
and
grasping
her
hand
that
it
is
over
between
us
for
it
became
clear
to
me
that
i
love
another
i
think
i
have
been
fond
of
her
for
a
long
time
but
i
did
not
know
it
until
whom
do
you
care
for
gudmund
came
in
a
colorless
voice
from
hildur
it
does
matter
i
shall
not
marry
her
as
she
does
not
care
for
me
nor
can
i
marry
anyone
else
hildur
raised
her
head
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
what
was
taking
place
in
her
at
this
moment
she
felt
that
she
the
rich
farmer
daughter
with
all
her
beauty
and
all
her
possessions
was
nothing
to
gudmund
she
was
proud
and
did
not
wish
to
part
from
him
without
teaching
him
that
she
had
a
value
of
her
own
apart
from
all
the
external
things
i
want
you
to
tell
me
gudmund
if
it
is
helga
from
big
marsh
whom
you
love
gudmund
was
silent
it
was
she
who
came
to
me
and
taught
me
what
i
should
do
that
all
might
be
well
between
us
she
knew
you
were
innocent
but
she
did
not
say
so
to
you
she
let
me
know
it
first
gudmund
looked
her
steadily
in
the
eyes
do
you
think
this
means
that
she
has
a
great
affection
for
me
you
may
be
sure
of
it
gudmund
i
can
prove
it
no
one
in
the
world
could
love
you
more
than
she
does
he
walked
rapidly
across
the
floor
and
back
then
he
stopped
suddenly
before
hildur
and
you
why
do
you
tell
me
this
surely
i
do
not
wish
to
stand
beneath
helga
in
magnanimity
oh
hildur
hildur
he
cried
placing
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
shaking
her
to
give
vent
to
his
emotion
you
do
know
oh
you
know
how
much
i
like
you
at
this
moment
you
do
know
how
happy
you
have
made
me
helga
sat
by
the
roadside
and
waited
with
her
cheek
resting
on
her
hand
she
sat
and
pictured
hildur
and
gudmund
together
and
thought
how
happy
they
must
be
now
while
she
sat
thus
a
servant
from
närlunda
came
along
he
stopped
when
he
saw
her
i
suppose
you
have
heard
that
affair
which
concerns
gudmund
she
had
it
was
not
true
fortunately
the
real
murderer
is
already
in
custody
i
knew
it
could
be
true
said
helga
thereupon
the
man
went
and
helga
sat
there
alone
as
before
so
they
knew
it
already
down
there
it
was
not
necessary
for
her
to
go
to
närlunda
and
tell
of
it
she
felt
herself
so
strangely
shut
out
earlier
in
the
day
she
had
been
so
eager
she
had
not
thought
of
herself
only
that
gudmund
and
marriage
should
take
place
but
now
it
flashed
upon
her
how
alone
she
was
and
it
was
hard
not
to
be
something
to
those
of
whom
one
is
fond
gudmund
did
not
need
her
now
and
her
own
child
had
been
appropriated
by
her
mother
who
would
hardly
allow
her
to
look
at
it
she
was
thinking
that
she
had
better
rise
and
go
home
but
the
hills
appeared
long
and
difficult
to
her
she
did
know
how
she
should
ever
be
able
to
climb
them
a
vehicle
came
along
now
from
the
direction
of
närlunda
hildur
and
gudmund
were
seated
in
the
cart
now
they
were
probably
on
their
way
to
älvåkra
to
tell
that
they
were
reconciled
the
wedding
would
take
place
when
they
discovered
helga
they
stopped
the
horse
gudmund
handed
the
reins
to
hildur
and
jumped
down
hildur
nodded
to
helga
and
drove
on
gudmund
remained
standing
on
the
road
and
facing
helga
i
am
glad
you
are
sitting
here
helga
he
said
i
thought
that
i
would
have
to
go
up
to
big
marsh
to
meet
you
he
said
this
abruptly
almost
harshly
at
the
same
time
he
gripped
her
hand
tightly
and
she
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
knew
now
where
he
had
her
now
she
could
no
more
escape
from
him
the
silver
mine
king
gustaf
the
third
was
travelling
through
dalecarlia
he
was
pressed
for
time
and
all
the
way
he
wanted
to
drive
like
lightning
although
they
drove
with
such
speed
that
the
horses
were
extended
like
stretched
rubber
bands
and
the
coach
cleared
the
turns
on
two
wheels
the
king
poked
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
shouted
to
the
postilion
why
do
you
go
ahead
do
you
think
you
are
driving
over
eggs
since
they
had
to
drive
over
poor
country
roads
at
such
a
mad
pace
it
would
have
been
almost
a
miracle
had
the
harness
and
wagon
held
together
and
they
did
either
for
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
hill
the
pole
broke
and
there
the
king
sat
the
courtiers
sprang
from
the
coach
and
scolded
the
driver
but
this
did
not
lessen
the
damage
done
there
was
no
possibility
of
continuing
the
journey
until
the
coach
was
mended
when
the
courtiers
looked
round
to
try
and
find
something
with
which
the
king
could
amuse
himself
while
he
waited
they
noticed
a
church
spire
looming
high
above
the
trees
in
a
grove
a
short
distance
ahead
they
intimated
to
the
king
that
he
might
step
into
one
of
the
coaches
in
which
the
attendants
were
riding
and
drive
up
to
the
church
it
was
a
sunday
and
the
king
might
attend
service
to
pass
the
time
until
the
royal
coach
was
ready
the
king
accepted
the
proposal
and
drove
toward
the
church
he
had
been
travelling
for
hours
through
dark
forest
regions
but
here
it
looked
more
cheerful
with
fairly
large
meadows
and
villages
and
with
the
dal
river
gliding
on
light
and
pretty
between
thick
rows
of
alder
bushes
but
the
king
had
to
this
extent
the
bellringer
took
up
the
recessional
chant
just
as
the
king
was
stepping
from
the
coach
on
the
church
knoll
and
the
people
were
coming
out
from
the
service
but
when
they
came
walking
past
him
the
king
remained
standing
with
one
foot
in
the
wagon
and
the
other
on
the
footstep
he
did
not
move
from
the
spot
only
stared
at
them
they
were
the
finest
lot
of
folk
he
had
ever
seen
all
the
men
were
above
the
average
height
with
intelligent
and
earnest
faces
and
the
women
were
dignified
and
stately
with
an
air
of
sabbath
peace
about
them
the
whole
of
the
preceding
day
the
king
had
talked
only
of
the
desolate
tracts
he
was
passing
through
and
had
said
to
his
courtiers
again
and
again
now
i
am
certainly
driving
through
the
very
poorest
part
of
my
kingdom
but
now
when
he
saw
the
people
garbed
in
the
picturesque
dress
of
this
section
of
the
country
he
forgot
to
think
of
their
poverty
instead
his
heart
warmed
and
he
remarked
to
himself
the
king
of
sweden
is
not
so
badly
off
as
his
enemies
think
so
long
as
my
subjects
look
like
this
i
shall
probably
be
able
to
defend
both
my
faith
and
my
country
he
commanded
the
courtiers
to
make
known
to
the
people
that
the
stranger
who
was
standing
amongst
them
was
their
king
and
that
they
should
gather
around
him
so
he
could
talk
to
them
and
then
the
king
made
a
speech
to
the
people
he
spoke
from
the
high
steps
outside
the
vestry
and
the
narrow
step
upon
which
he
stood
is
there
even
the
king
gave
an
account
of
the
sad
plight
in
which
the
kingdom
was
placed
he
said
that
the
swedes
were
threatened
with
war
both
by
russians
and
danes
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
be
such
a
serious
matter
but
now
the
army
was
filled
with
traitors
and
he
did
not
dare
depend
upon
it
therefore
there
was
no
other
course
for
him
to
pursue
than
to
go
himself
into
the
country
settlements
and
ask
his
subjects
if
they
would
be
loyal
to
their
king
and
help
him
with
men
and
money
so
he
could
save
the
fatherland
the
peasants
stood
quietly
while
the
king
was
speaking
and
when
he
had
finished
they
gave
no
sign
either
of
approval
or
disapproval
the
king
himself
thought
that
he
had
spoken
very
well
the
tears
had
sprung
to
his
eyes
several
times
while
he
was
speaking
but
when
the
peasants
stood
there
all
the
while
troubled
and
undecided
and
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
answer
him
the
king
frowned
and
looked
displeased
the
peasants
understood
that
it
was
becoming
monotonous
for
the
king
to
wait
and
finally
one
of
them
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
now
you
must
know
king
gustaf
that
we
were
not
expecting
a
royal
visit
in
the
parish
said
the
peasant
and
therefore
we
are
not
prepared
to
answer
you
at
once
i
advise
you
to
go
into
the
vestry
and
speak
with
our
pastor
while
we
discuss
among
ourselves
this
matter
which
you
have
laid
before
us
the
king
apprehended
that
a
more
satisfactory
response
was
not
to
be
had
immediately
so
he
felt
that
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
follow
the
peasant
advice
when
he
came
into
the
vestry
he
found
no
one
there
but
a
man
who
looked
like
a
peasant
he
was
tall
and
rugged
with
big
hands
toughened
by
labor
and
he
wore
neither
cassock
nor
collar
but
leather
breeches
and
a
long
white
homespun
coat
like
all
the
other
men
he
arose
and
bowed
to
the
king
when
the
latter
entered
i
thought
i
should
find
the
parson
in
here
said
the
king
the
man
grew
somewhat
red
in
the
face
he
thought
it
annoying
to
mention
the
fact
that
he
was
the
parson
of
this
parish
when
he
saw
that
the
king
had
mistaken
him
for
a
peasant
yes
said
he
the
parson
is
usually
on
hand
in
here
the
king
dropped
into
a
large
armchair
which
stood
in
the
vestry
at
that
time
and
which
stands
there
looking
exactly
like
itself
with
this
difference
the
congregation
has
had
a
gilded
crown
attached
to
the
back
of
it
have
you
a
good
parson
in
this
parish
asked
the
king
who
wanted
to
appear
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
peasants
when
the
king
questioned
him
in
this
manner
the
parson
felt
that
he
could
possibly
tell
who
he
was
it
better
to
let
him
go
on
believing
that
i
only
a
peasant
thought
he
and
replied
that
the
parson
was
good
enough
he
preached
a
pure
and
clear
gospel
and
tried
to
live
as
he
taught
the
king
thought
that
this
was
a
good
commendation
but
he
had
a
sharp
ear
and
marked
a
certain
doubt
in
the
tone
you
sound
as
if
you
were
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
parson
said
the
king
he
a
bit
arbitrary
said
the
man
thinking
that
if
the
king
should
find
out
later
who
he
was
he
would
not
think
that
the
parson
had
been
standing
here
and
blowing
his
own
horn
therefore
he
wished
to
come
out
with
a
little
also
there
are
some
no
doubt
who
say
the
parson
wants
to
be
the
only
one
to
counsel
and
rule
in
this
parish
he
continued
then
at
all
events
he
has
led
and
managed
in
the
best
possible
way
said
the
king
he
did
like
it
that
the
peasant
complained
of
one
who
was
placed
above
him
to
me
it
appears
as
though
good
habits
and
simplicity
were
the
rule
here
the
people
are
good
enough
said
the
curate
but
then
they
live
in
poverty
and
isolation
human
beings
here
would
certainly
be
no
better
than
others
if
this
world
temptations
came
closer
to
them
but
there
no
fear
of
anything
of
the
sort
happening
said
the
king
with
a
shrug
he
said
nothing
further
but
began
thrumming
on
the
table
with
his
fingers
he
thought
he
had
exchanged
a
sufficient
number
of
gracious
words
with
this
peasant
and
wondered
when
the
others
would
be
ready
with
their
answer
these
peasants
are
not
very
eager
to
help
their
king
thought
he
if
i
only
had
my
coach
i
would
drive
away
from
them
and
their
palaver
the
pastor
sat
there
troubled
debating
with
himself
as
to
how
he
should
decide
an
important
matter
which
he
must
settle
he
was
beginning
to
feel
happy
because
he
had
not
told
the
king
who
he
was
now
he
felt
that
he
could
speak
with
him
about
matters
which
otherwise
he
could
not
have
placed
before
him
after
a
while
the
parson
broke
the
silence
and
asked
the
king
if
it
was
an
actual
fact
that
enemies
were
upon
them
and
that
the
kingdom
was
in
danger
the
king
thought
this
man
ought
to
have
sense
enough
not
to
trouble
him
further
he
simply
glared
at
him
and
said
nothing
i
ask
because
i
was
standing
in
here
and
could
not
hear
very
well
said
the
parson
but
if
this
is
really
the
case
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
the
pastor
of
this
congregation
might
perhaps
be
able
to
procure
for
the
king
as
much
money
as
he
will
need
i
thought
you
said
just
now
that
every
one
here
was
poor
said
the
king
thinking
that
the
man
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
yes
that
is
true
replied
the
rector
and
the
parson
has
no
more
than
any
of
the
others
but
if
the
king
would
condescend
to
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
i
will
explain
how
the
pastor
happens
to
have
the
power
to
help
him
you
may
speak
said
the
king
you
seem
to
find
it
easier
to
get
the
words
past
your
lips
than
your
friends
and
neighbors
out
there
who
never
will
be
ready
with
what
they
have
to
tell
me
it
is
not
so
easy
to
reply
to
the
king
i
afraid
that
in
the
end
it
will
be
the
parson
who
must
undertake
this
on
behalf
of
the
others
the
king
crossed
his
legs
folded
his
arms
and
let
his
head
sink
down
on
his
breast
you
may
begin
now
he
said
in
the
tone
of
one
already
asleep
once
upon
a
time
there
were
five
men
from
this
parish
who
were
out
on
a
moose
hunt
began
the
clergyman
one
of
them
was
the
parson
of
whom
we
are
speaking
two
of
the
others
were
soldiers
named
olaf
and
eric
svärd
the
fourth
man
was
the
innkeeper
in
this
settlement
and
the
fifth
was
a
peasant
named
israel
per
persson
do
go
to
the
trouble
of
mentioning
so
many
names
muttered
the
king
letting
his
head
droop
to
one
side
those
men
were
good
hunters
continued
the
parson
who
usually
had
luck
with
them
but
that
day
they
had
wandered
long
and
far
without
getting
anything
finally
they
gave
up
the
hunt
altogether
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
to
talk
they
said
there
was
not
a
spot
in
the
whole
forest
fit
for
cultivation
all
of
it
was
only
mountain
and
swamp
land
lord
has
not
done
right
by
us
in
giving
us
such
a
poor
land
to
live
in
said
one
other
localities
people
can
get
riches
for
themselves
in
abundance
but
here
with
all
our
toil
and
drudgery
we
can
scarcely
get
our
daily
bread
the
pastor
paused
a
moment
as
if
uncertain
that
the
king
heard
him
but
the
latter
moved
his
little
finger
to
show
that
he
was
awake
just
as
the
hunters
were
discussing
this
matter
the
parson
saw
something
that
glittered
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
where
he
had
kicked
away
a
is
a
queer
mountain
he
thought
as
he
kicked
off
another
he
picked
up
a
shiver
of
stone
that
came
with
the
moss
and
which
shone
exactly
like
the
other
ca
be
possible
that
this
stuff
is
lead
said
he
then
the
others
sprang
up
and
scraped
away
the
turf
with
the
butt
end
of
their
rifles
when
they
did
this
they
saw
plainly
that
a
broad
vein
of
ore
followed
the
mountain
do
you
think
this
might
be
asked
the
parson
the
men
chipped
off
bits
of
stone
and
bit
into
them
must
be
lead
or
zinc
at
least
said
they
the
whole
mountain
is
full
of
it
added
the
innkeeper
when
the
parson
had
got
thus
far
in
his
narrative
the
king
head
was
seen
to
straighten
up
a
little
and
one
eye
opened
do
you
know
if
any
of
those
persons
knew
anything
about
ore
and
minerals
he
asked
they
did
not
replied
the
parson
then
the
king
head
sank
and
both
eyes
closed
the
clergyman
and
his
companions
were
very
happy
continued
the
speaker
without
letting
himself
be
disturbed
by
the
indifference
they
fancied
that
now
they
had
found
that
which
would
give
them
and
their
descendants
wealth
never
have
to
do
any
more
work
said
one
i
can
afford
to
do
nothing
at
all
the
whole
week
through
and
on
sundays
i
shall
drive
to
church
in
a
golden
chariot
they
were
otherwise
sensible
men
but
the
great
find
had
gone
to
their
heads
and
they
talked
like
children
still
they
had
enough
presence
of
mind
to
put
back
the
and
conceal
the
vein
of
then
they
carefully
noted
the
place
where
it
was
and
went
home
before
they
parted
company
they
agreed
that
the
parson
should
travel
to
falun
and
ask
the
mining
expert
what
kind
of
ore
this
was
he
was
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
and
until
then
they
promised
one
another
on
oath
not
to
reveal
to
a
single
soul
where
the
ore
was
to
be
found
the
king
head
was
raised
again
a
trifle
but
he
did
not
interrupt
the
speaker
with
a
word
it
appeared
as
though
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
the
man
actually
had
something
of
importance
he
wished
to
say
to
him
since
he
did
allow
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
his
indifference
then
the
parson
departed
with
a
few
samples
of
ore
in
his
pocket
he
was
just
as
happy
in
the
thought
of
becoming
rich
as
the
others
were
he
was
thinking
of
rebuilding
the
parsonage
which
at
present
was
no
better
than
a
peasant
cottage
and
then
he
would
marry
a
dean
daughter
whom
he
liked
he
had
thought
that
he
might
have
to
wait
for
her
many
years
he
was
poor
and
obscure
and
knew
that
it
would
be
a
long
while
before
he
should
get
any
post
that
would
enable
him
to
marry
the
parson
drove
over
to
falun
in
two
days
and
there
he
had
to
wait
another
whole
day
because
the
mining
expert
was
away
finally
he
ran
across
him
and
showed
him
the
bits
of
ore
the
mining
expert
took
them
in
his
hand
he
looked
at
them
first
then
at
the
parson
the
parson
related
how
he
had
found
them
in
a
mountain
at
home
in
his
parish
and
wondered
if
it
might
not
be
lead
it
not
lead
said
the
mining
expert
it
is
zinc
then
asked
the
parson
is
it
zinc
said
the
mineralogist
the
parson
thought
that
all
the
hope
within
him
sank
he
had
not
been
so
depressed
in
many
a
long
day
you
many
stones
like
these
in
your
parish
asked
the
mineralogist
have
a
whole
mountain
full
said
the
parson
then
the
mineralogist
came
up
closer
slapped
the
parson
on
the
shoulder
and
said
us
see
that
you
make
such
good
use
of
this
that
it
will
prove
a
blessing
both
to
yourselves
and
to
the
country
for
this
is
silver
said
the
parson
feeling
his
way
it
is
silver
the
mineralogist
began
telling
him
how
he
should
go
to
work
to
get
legal
rights
to
the
mine
and
gave
him
many
valuable
suggestions
but
the
parson
stood
there
dazed
and
did
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
he
was
only
thinking
of
how
wonderful
it
was
that
at
home
in
his
poor
parish
stood
a
whole
mountain
of
silver
ore
waiting
for
him
the
king
raised
his
head
so
suddenly
that
the
parson
stopped
short
in
his
narrative
it
turned
out
of
course
that
when
he
got
home
and
began
working
the
mine
he
saw
that
the
mineralogist
had
only
been
fooling
him
said
the
king
oh
no
the
mineralogist
had
not
fooled
him
said
the
parson
you
may
continue
said
the
king
as
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
in
the
chair
to
listen
when
the
parson
was
at
home
again
and
was
driving
through
the
parish
continued
the
clergyman
he
thought
that
first
of
all
he
should
inform
his
partners
of
the
value
of
their
find
and
as
he
drove
alongside
the
innkeeper
sten
stensson
place
he
intended
to
drive
up
to
the
house
to
tell
him
they
had
found
silver
but
when
he
stopped
outside
the
gate
he
noticed
that
a
broad
path
of
evergreen
was
strewn
all
the
way
up
to
the
doorstep
has
died
in
this
place
asked
the
parson
of
a
boy
who
stood
leaning
against
the
fence
innkeeper
himself
answered
the
boy
then
he
let
the
clergyman
know
that
the
innkeeper
had
drunk
himself
full
every
day
for
a
week
so
much
brandy
so
much
brandy
has
been
drunk
here
can
that
be
asked
the
parson
innkeeper
used
never
to
drink
himself
full
said
the
boy
drank
because
he
said
he
had
found
a
mine
he
was
very
rich
he
should
never
have
to
do
anything
now
but
drink
he
said
last
night
he
drove
off
full
as
he
was
and
the
wagon
turned
over
and
he
was
killed
when
the
parson
heard
this
he
drove
homeward
he
was
distressed
over
what
he
had
heard
he
had
come
back
so
happy
rejoicing
because
he
could
tell
the
great
good
news
when
the
parson
had
driven
a
few
paces
he
saw
israel
per
persson
walking
along
he
looked
about
as
usual
and
the
parson
thought
it
was
well
that
fortune
had
not
gone
to
his
head
too
him
he
would
cheer
at
once
with
the
news
that
he
was
a
rich
man
day
said
per
persson
you
come
from
falun
now
do
said
the
parson
now
i
must
tell
you
that
it
has
turned
out
even
better
than
we
had
imagined
the
mineralogist
said
it
was
silver
ore
that
we
had
found
that
instant
per
persson
looked
as
though
the
ground
under
him
had
opened
are
you
saying
what
are
you
saying
is
it
silver
answered
the
parson
all
be
rich
men
now
all
of
us
and
can
live
like
gentlemen
is
it
silver
said
per
persson
once
again
looking
more
and
more
mournful
of
course
it
is
silver
replied
the
parson
must
think
that
i
want
to
deceive
you
you
must
be
afraid
of
being
happy
said
per
persson
i
be
happy
i
believed
it
was
only
glitter
that
we
had
found
so
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
take
the
certain
for
the
uncertain
i
have
sold
my
share
in
the
mine
to
olaf
svärd
for
a
hundred
dollars
he
was
desperate
and
when
the
parson
drove
away
from
him
he
stood
on
the
highway
and
wept
when
the
clergyman
got
back
to
his
home
he
sent
a
servant
to
olaf
svärd
and
his
brother
to
tell
them
that
it
was
silver
they
had
found
he
thought
that
he
had
had
quite
enough
of
driving
around
and
spreading
the
good
news
but
in
the
evening
when
the
parson
sat
alone
his
joy
asserted
itself
again
he
went
out
in
the
darkness
and
stood
on
a
hillock
upon
which
he
contemplated
building
the
new
parsonage
it
should
be
imposing
of
course
as
fine
as
a
bishop
palace
he
stood
out
there
long
that
night
nor
did
he
content
himself
with
rebuilding
the
parsonage
it
occurred
to
him
that
since
there
were
such
riches
to
be
found
in
the
parish
throngs
of
people
would
pour
in
and
finally
a
whole
city
would
be
built
around
the
mine
and
then
he
would
have
to
erect
a
new
church
in
place
of
the
old
one
towards
this
object
a
large
portion
of
his
wealth
would
probably
go
and
he
was
not
content
with
this
either
but
fancied
that
when
his
church
was
ready
the
king
and
many
bishops
would
come
to
the
dedication
then
the
king
would
be
pleased
with
the
church
but
he
would
remark
that
there
was
no
place
where
a
king
might
put
up
and
then
he
would
have
to
erect
a
castle
in
the
new
city
just
then
one
of
the
king
courtiers
opened
the
door
of
the
vestry
and
announced
that
the
big
royal
coach
was
mended
at
the
first
moment
the
king
was
ready
to
withdraw
but
on
second
thought
he
changed
his
mind
you
may
tell
your
story
to
the
end
he
said
to
the
parson
but
you
can
hurry
it
a
bit
we
know
all
about
how
the
man
thought
and
dreamed
we
want
to
know
how
he
acted
but
while
the
parson
was
still
lost
in
his
dreams
continued
the
clergyman
word
came
to
him
that
israel
per
persson
had
made
away
with
himself
he
had
not
been
able
to
bear
the
disappointment
of
having
sold
his
share
in
the
mine
he
had
thought
no
doubt
that
he
could
not
endure
to
go
about
every
day
seeing
another
enjoying
the
wealth
that
might
have
been
his
the
king
straightened
up
a
little
he
kept
both
eyes
open
upon
my
word
he
said
if
i
had
been
that
parson
i
should
have
had
enough
of
the
mine
the
king
is
a
rich
man
said
the
parson
he
has
quite
enough
at
all
events
it
is
not
the
same
thing
with
a
poor
curate
who
possesses
nothing
the
unhappy
wretch
thought
instead
when
he
saw
that
blessing
was
not
with
his
enterprise
will
dream
no
more
of
bringing
glory
and
profit
to
myself
with
these
riches
but
i
ca
let
the
silver
lie
buried
in
the
earth
i
must
take
it
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
and
needy
i
will
work
the
mine
to
put
the
whole
parish
on
its
feet
so
one
day
the
parson
went
out
to
see
olaf
svärd
to
ask
him
and
his
brother
as
to
what
should
be
done
immediately
with
the
silver
mountain
when
he
came
in
the
vicinity
of
the
barracks
he
met
a
cart
surrounded
by
armed
peasants
and
in
the
cart
sat
a
man
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
and
a
rope
around
his
ankles
when
the
parson
passed
by
the
cart
stopped
and
he
had
time
to
regard
the
prisoner
whose
head
was
tied
up
so
it
was
easy
to
see
who
he
was
but
the
parson
thought
he
recognized
olaf
svärd
he
heard
the
prisoner
beg
those
who
guarded
him
to
let
him
speak
a
few
words
with
the
parson
the
parson
drew
nearer
and
the
prisoner
turned
toward
him
will
soon
be
the
only
one
who
knows
where
the
silver
mine
is
said
olaf
are
you
saying
olaf
asked
the
parson
you
see
parson
since
we
have
learned
that
it
was
a
silver
mine
we
had
found
my
brother
and
i
could
no
longer
be
as
good
friends
as
before
we
were
continually
quarrelling
last
night
we
got
into
a
controversy
over
which
one
of
us
five
it
was
who
first
discovered
the
mine
it
ended
in
strife
between
us
and
we
came
to
blows
i
have
killed
my
brother
and
he
has
left
me
with
a
souvenir
across
the
forehead
to
remember
him
by
i
must
hang
now
and
then
you
will
be
the
only
one
who
knows
anything
about
the
mine
therefore
i
wish
to
ask
something
of
you
out
said
the
parson
do
what
i
can
for
you
know
that
l
am
leaving
several
little
children
behind
me
began
the
soldier
but
the
parson
interrupted
him
regards
this
you
can
rest
easy
that
which
comes
to
your
share
in
the
mine
they
shall
have
exactly
as
if
you
yourself
were
living
said
olaf
svärd
was
another
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
of
you
do
let
them
have
any
portion
of
that
which
comes
from
the
mine
the
parson
staggered
back
a
step
he
stood
there
dumb
and
could
not
answer
you
do
not
promise
me
this
i
can
not
die
in
peace
said
the
prisoner
said
the
parson
slowly
and
painfully
promise
you
what
you
ask
of
me
thereupon
the
murderer
was
taken
away
and
the
parson
stood
on
the
highway
thinking
how
he
should
keep
the
promise
he
had
given
him
on
the
way
home
he
thought
of
the
wealth
which
he
had
been
so
happy
over
but
if
it
really
were
true
that
the
people
in
this
community
could
not
stand
riches
already
four
were
ruined
who
hitherto
had
been
dignified
and
excellent
men
he
seemed
to
see
the
whole
community
before
him
and
he
pictured
to
himself
how
this
silver
mine
would
destroy
one
after
another
was
it
befitting
that
he
who
had
been
appointed
to
watch
over
these
poor
human
beings
souls
should
let
loose
upon
them
that
which
would
be
their
destruction
all
of
a
sudden
the
king
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
i
declare
said
he
you
make
me
understand
that
a
parson
in
this
isolated
settlement
must
be
every
inch
a
man
nor
was
it
enough
with
what
had
already
happened
continued
the
parson
for
as
soon
as
the
news
about
the
mine
spread
among
the
parishioners
they
stopped
working
and
went
about
in
idleness
waiting
for
the
time
when
great
riches
should
pour
in
on
them
all
the
there
were
in
this
section
streamed
in
and
drunkenness
and
fighting
were
what
the
parson
heard
talked
of
continually
a
lot
of
people
did
nothing
but
tramp
round
in
the
forest
searching
for
the
mine
and
the
parson
marked
that
as
soon
as
he
left
the
house
people
followed
him
stealthily
to
find
out
if
he
was
going
to
the
silver
mountain
and
to
steal
the
secret
from
him
when
matters
were
come
to
this
pass
the
parson
called
the
peasants
together
to
vote
to
start
with
he
reminded
them
of
all
the
misfortunes
which
the
discovery
of
the
mountain
had
brought
upon
them
and
he
asked
them
if
they
were
going
to
let
themselves
be
ruined
or
if
they
would
save
themselves
then
he
told
them
that
they
must
not
expect
him
who
was
their
spiritual
adviser
to
help
on
their
destruction
now
he
had
decided
not
to
reveal
to
any
one
where
the
silver
mine
was
and
never
would
he
himself
take
riches
from
it
and
then
he
asked
the
peasants
how
they
would
have
it
henceforth
if
they
wished
to
continue
their
search
for
the
mine
and
wait
upon
riches
then
he
would
go
so
far
away
that
not
a
hearsay
of
their
misery
could
reach
him
but
if
they
would
give
up
thinking
about
the
silver
mine
and
be
as
heretofore
he
would
remain
with
them
way
you
may
choose
said
the
parson
this
that
from
me
no
one
shall
ever
know
anything
about
the
silver
mountain
well
said
the
king
how
did
they
decide
they
did
as
their
pastor
wished
said
the
parson
they
understood
that
he
meant
well
by
them
when
he
wanted
to
remain
poor
for
their
sakes
and
they
commissioned
him
to
go
to
the
forest
and
conceal
the
vein
of
ore
with
evergreen
and
stone
so
that
no
one
would
be
able
to
find
it
neither
they
themselves
nor
their
posterity
and
ever
since
the
parson
has
been
living
here
just
as
poor
as
the
rest
yes
answered
the
curate
he
has
lived
here
just
as
poor
as
the
rest
he
has
married
of
course
and
built
himself
a
new
parsonage
said
the
king
no
he
could
afford
to
marry
and
he
lives
in
the
old
cabin
it
a
pretty
story
that
you
have
told
me
said
the
king
after
a
few
seconds
he
resumed
was
it
of
the
silver
mountain
that
you
were
thinking
when
you
said
that
the
parson
here
would
be
able
to
procure
for
me
as
much
money
as
i
need
yes
said
the
other
but
i
ca
put
the
on
him
said
the
king
or
how
would
you
that
i
should
get
such
a
man
to
show
me
the
mountain
a
man
who
has
renounced
his
sweetheart
and
all
the
allurements
of
life
oh
that
a
different
matter
said
the
parson
but
if
it
the
fatherland
that
is
in
need
of
the
fortune
he
will
probably
give
in
will
you
answer
for
that
asked
the
king
yes
that
i
will
answer
for
said
the
clergyman
does
he
care
then
what
becomes
of
his
parishioners
that
can
rest
in
god
hand
the
king
rose
from
the
chair
and
walked
over
to
the
window
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
upon
the
group
of
people
outside
the
longer
he
looked
the
clearer
his
large
eyes
shone
and
his
figure
seemed
to
grow
you
may
greet
the
pastor
of
this
congregation
and
say
that
for
sweden
king
there
is
no
sight
more
beautiful
than
to
see
a
people
such
as
this
then
the
king
turned
from
the
window
and
looked
at
the
clergyman
he
began
to
smile
is
it
true
that
the
pastor
of
this
parish
is
so
poor
that
he
removes
his
black
clothes
as
soon
as
the
service
is
over
and
dresses
himself
like
a
peasant
asked
the
king
yes
so
poor
is
he
said
the
curate
and
a
crimson
flush
leaped
into
his
face
the
king
went
back
to
the
window
one
could
see
that
he
was
in
his
best
mood
all
that
was
noble
and
great
within
him
had
been
quickened
into
life
you
must
let
that
mine
lie
in
peace
said
the
king
inasmuch
as
you
have
labored
and
starved
a
lifetime
to
make
this
people
such
as
you
would
have
it
you
may
keep
it
as
it
is
but
if
the
kingdom
is
in
danger
said
the
parson
the
kingdom
is
better
served
with
men
than
with
money
remarked
the
king
when
he
had
said
this
he
bade
the
clergyman
farewell
and
went
out
from
the
vestry
without
stood
the
group
of
people
as
quiet
and
taciturn
as
they
were
when
he
went
in
as
the
king
came
down
the
steps
a
peasant
stepped
up
to
him
have
you
had
a
talk
with
our
pastor
said
the
peasant
yes
said
the
king
i
have
talked
with
him
then
of
course
you
have
our
answer
said
the
peasant
we
asked
you
to
go
in
and
talk
with
our
parson
that
he
might
give
you
an
answer
from
us
i
have
the
answer
said
the
king
the
airship
father
and
the
boys
are
seated
one
rainy
october
evening
in
a
railway
coach
on
their
way
to
stockholm
the
father
is
sitting
by
himself
on
one
bench
and
the
boys
sit
close
together
directly
opposite
him
reading
a
jules
verne
romance
entitled
six
weeks
in
a
balloon
the
book
is
much
worn
the
boys
know
it
almost
by
heart
and
have
held
endless
discussions
on
it
but
they
always
read
it
with
the
same
pleasure
they
have
forgotten
everything
else
to
follow
the
daring
sailors
of
the
air
all
over
africa
and
seldom
raise
their
eyes
from
the
book
to
glance
at
the
swedish
towns
they
are
travelling
through
the
boys
are
very
like
each
other
they
are
the
same
height
are
dressed
alike
with
blue
caps
and
gray
overcoats
and
both
have
large
dreamy
eyes
and
little
pug
noses
they
are
always
good
friends
always
together
do
not
bother
with
other
children
and
are
forever
talking
about
inventions
and
exploring
expeditions
in
point
of
talent
they
are
quite
unlike
lennart
the
elder
who
is
thirteen
is
backward
in
his
studies
at
the
high
school
and
can
hardly
keep
up
with
his
class
in
any
theme
to
make
up
for
this
he
is
very
handy
and
enterprising
he
is
going
to
be
an
inventor
and
works
all
the
time
on
a
which
he
is
constructing
hugo
is
a
year
younger
than
lennart
but
he
is
quicker
at
study
and
is
already
in
the
same
grade
as
his
brother
he
does
find
studying
any
special
fun
either
but
on
the
other
hand
he
is
a
great
sportsman
a
a
cyclist
and
a
skater
he
intends
to
start
out
on
voyages
of
discovery
when
he
is
grown
up
as
soon
as
lennart
airship
is
ready
hugo
is
going
to
travel
in
it
in
order
to
explore
what
is
still
left
of
this
globe
to
be
discovered
their
father
is
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
sunken
chest
a
haggard
face
and
pretty
slender
hands
he
is
carelessly
dressed
his
shirt
bosom
is
wrinkled
and
the
coat
band
pokes
up
at
the
neck
his
vest
is
buttoned
wrongly
and
his
socks
sag
down
over
his
shoes
he
wears
his
hair
so
long
at
the
neck
that
it
hangs
on
his
coat
collar
this
is
due
not
to
carelessness
but
to
habit
and
taste
the
father
is
a
descendant
of
an
old
musical
family
from
far
back
in
a
rural
district
and
he
has
brought
with
him
into
the
world
two
strong
inclinations
one
of
which
is
a
great
musical
talent
and
it
was
this
that
first
came
into
the
light
he
was
graduated
from
the
academy
in
stockholm
and
then
studied
a
few
years
abroad
and
during
these
study
years
made
such
brilliant
progress
that
both
he
and
his
teacher
thought
he
would
some
day
be
a
great
and
violinist
he
certainly
had
talent
enough
to
reach
the
goal
but
he
lacked
grit
and
perseverance
he
could
fight
his
way
to
any
sort
of
standing
out
in
the
world
but
soon
came
home
again
and
accepted
a
situation
as
organist
in
a
country
town
at
the
start
he
felt
ashamed
because
he
had
not
lived
up
to
the
expectations
of
every
one
but
he
felt
also
that
it
was
good
to
have
an
assured
income
and
not
be
forced
to
depend
any
longer
upon
the
charity
of
others
shortly
after
he
had
got
the
appointment
he
married
and
a
few
years
later
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
lot
he
had
a
pretty
little
home
a
cheerful
and
contented
wife
and
two
little
boys
he
was
the
town
favorite
feted
and
in
great
demand
everywhere
but
then
there
came
a
time
when
all
this
did
not
seem
to
satisfy
him
he
longed
to
go
out
in
the
world
once
more
and
try
his
luck
but
he
felt
bound
down
at
home
because
he
had
a
wife
and
children
more
than
all
it
was
the
wife
who
had
persuaded
him
to
give
up
this
journey
she
had
not
believed
that
he
would
succeed
any
better
now
than
before
she
felt
they
were
so
happy
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
strive
after
anything
else
unquestionably
she
made
a
mistake
in
this
instance
but
she
also
lived
to
regret
it
bitterly
for
from
that
time
on
the
other
family
trait
showed
itself
when
his
yearning
for
success
and
fame
was
not
satisfied
he
tried
to
console
himself
with
drinking
now
it
turned
out
with
him
as
was
usual
with
folk
of
his
family
he
drank
inordinately
by
degrees
he
became
an
entirely
different
person
he
was
no
longer
charming
or
lovable
but
harsh
and
cruel
and
the
greatest
misfortune
of
all
was
that
he
conceived
a
terrible
hatred
for
his
wife
and
tortured
her
in
every
conceivable
way
both
when
he
was
drunk
and
when
he
was
so
the
boys
did
not
have
a
good
home
and
their
childhood
would
have
been
very
unhappy
had
they
not
been
able
to
create
for
themselves
a
little
world
of
their
own
filled
with
machine
models
exploring
schemes
and
books
of
adventure
the
only
one
who
has
ever
caught
a
glimpse
of
this
world
is
the
mother
the
father
has
even
a
suspicion
of
its
existence
nor
can
he
talk
with
the
boys
about
anything
that
interests
them
he
disturbs
them
time
and
again
by
asking
if
they
do
think
it
will
be
fun
to
see
stockholm
if
they
are
not
glad
to
be
out
travelling
with
father
and
other
things
in
that
way
to
which
the
boys
give
brief
replies
in
order
that
they
may
immediately
bury
themselves
in
the
book
again
nevertheless
the
father
continues
to
question
the
boys
he
thinks
they
are
charmed
with
his
affability
although
they
are
too
bashful
to
show
it
they
have
been
too
long
under
petticoat
rule
he
thinks
they
have
become
timid
and
there
will
be
some
go
in
them
now
when
i
take
them
in
hand
father
is
mistaken
it
is
not
because
the
boys
are
bashful
that
they
answer
him
so
briefly
it
simply
shows
that
they
are
well
brought
up
and
do
not
wish
to
hurt
his
feelings
if
they
were
not
polite
they
would
answer
him
in
a
very
different
manner
why
should
we
think
it
fun
to
be
travelling
with
father
they
would
then
say
father
must
think
himself
something
wonderful
but
we
know
of
course
that
he
is
only
a
poor
wreck
of
a
man
and
why
should
we
be
glad
to
see
stockholm
we
understand
very
well
that
it
is
not
for
our
sakes
that
father
has
taken
us
along
but
only
to
make
mother
unhappy
it
would
be
wiser
no
doubt
if
the
father
were
to
let
the
boys
read
without
interrupting
them
they
are
sad
and
apprehensive
and
it
irritates
them
to
see
him
in
a
good
humor
it
is
only
because
he
knows
that
mother
is
sitting
at
home
crying
that
he
is
so
happy
they
whisper
to
each
other
father
questions
finally
bring
matters
to
this
pass
the
boys
read
no
more
although
they
continue
to
sit
bent
over
the
book
instead
their
thoughts
begin
in
bitterness
to
embrace
all
that
they
have
had
to
endure
on
their
father
account
they
remember
the
time
when
he
drank
himself
full
in
the
morning
and
came
staggering
up
the
street
with
a
crowd
of
school
boys
after
him
who
poked
fun
at
him
they
recall
how
the
other
boys
teased
them
and
gave
them
nicknames
because
they
had
a
father
who
drank
they
have
been
put
to
shame
for
their
father
they
have
been
forced
to
live
in
a
state
of
constant
anxiety
for
his
sake
and
as
soon
as
they
were
having
any
enjoyment
he
always
came
and
spoiled
their
fun
it
is
no
small
register
of
sins
that
they
are
setting
down
against
him
the
boys
are
very
meek
and
patient
but
they
feel
a
greater
and
greater
wrath
springing
up
in
them
he
should
at
least
understand
that
as
yet
they
can
not
forgive
him
for
the
great
wrong
he
did
them
yesterday
this
was
by
far
the
worst
wrong
he
had
ever
done
them
it
seems
that
last
year
mother
and
the
boys
decided
to
part
from
father
for
a
number
of
years
he
had
been
persecuting
and
torturing
her
in
every
possible
way
but
she
was
loath
to
part
from
him
and
remained
so
that
he
would
go
altogether
to
rack
and
ruin
but
now
at
last
she
wanted
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
her
boys
she
had
noticed
that
their
father
made
them
unhappy
and
realized
that
she
must
take
them
away
from
this
misery
and
provide
them
with
a
good
and
peaceable
home
when
the
spring
was
over
she
sent
them
to
her
parents
in
the
country
and
she
herself
went
abroad
in
order
to
obtain
a
divorce
in
the
easiest
way
possible
she
regretted
that
by
going
about
it
in
this
way
it
would
appear
as
though
it
were
her
fault
that
the
marriage
was
dissolved
but
that
she
must
submit
to
she
was
even
less
pleased
when
the
courts
turned
the
boys
over
to
the
father
because
she
was
a
wife
she
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
he
could
possibly
wish
to
keep
the
children
but
she
had
felt
quite
ill
at
ease
as
soon
as
the
divorce
was
settled
she
came
back
and
took
a
small
apartment
where
she
and
the
boys
were
to
live
in
two
days
she
had
everything
in
readiness
so
that
they
could
come
home
to
her
it
was
the
happiest
day
the
boys
had
experienced
the
entire
apartment
consisted
of
one
large
and
a
big
kitchen
but
everything
was
new
and
pretty
and
mother
had
arranged
the
place
so
cosily
the
big
room
she
and
they
were
to
use
daytimes
as
a
and
nights
they
were
to
sleep
there
the
kitchen
was
light
and
comfortable
there
they
would
eat
and
in
a
little
closet
off
the
kitchen
mother
had
her
bed
she
had
told
them
that
they
would
be
very
poor
she
had
secured
a
place
as
at
the
girls
school
and
this
was
all
they
had
to
live
upon
they
could
afford
to
keep
a
servant
but
must
get
along
all
by
themselves
the
boys
were
in
ecstasies
over
everything
most
of
all
because
they
might
help
along
they
volunteered
to
carry
water
and
wood
they
were
to
brush
their
own
shoes
and
make
their
own
beds
it
was
only
fun
to
think
up
all
that
they
were
going
to
do
there
was
a
little
wardrobe
in
which
lennart
was
to
keep
all
his
mechanical
apparatus
he
was
to
have
the
key
himself
and
no
one
but
hugo
and
he
should
ever
go
in
there
but
the
boys
were
allowed
to
be
happy
with
their
mother
only
for
a
single
day
afterwards
their
father
spoiled
their
pleasure
as
he
had
always
done
as
far
back
as
they
could
remember
mother
told
them
she
had
heard
that
their
father
had
received
a
legacy
of
a
few
thousand
kronor
and
that
he
had
resigned
from
his
position
as
organist
and
was
going
to
move
to
stockholm
both
they
and
mother
were
glad
that
he
was
leaving
town
so
they
would
escape
meeting
him
on
the
streets
and
then
a
friend
of
father
had
called
on
mother
to
tell
her
that
father
wanted
to
take
the
boys
with
him
to
stockholm
mother
had
wept
and
begged
that
she
might
keep
her
boys
but
messenger
had
answered
her
that
her
husband
was
determined
to
have
the
boys
under
his
guardianship
if
they
did
not
come
willingly
he
would
let
the
police
fetch
them
he
bade
mother
read
through
the
divorce
papers
and
there
it
said
plainly
that
the
boys
would
belong
to
their
father
this
of
course
she
already
knew
it
was
not
to
be
gainsaid
father
friend
had
said
many
nice
things
of
father
and
had
told
her
of
how
much
he
loved
his
sons
and
for
this
reason
he
wanted
them
to
be
with
him
but
the
boys
knew
that
father
was
taking
them
away
solely
for
the
purpose
of
torturing
mother
she
would
have
to
live
in
a
state
of
continual
anxiety
for
them
the
whole
thing
was
nothing
but
malice
and
revenge
but
father
had
his
own
way
and
here
they
were
now
on
their
way
to
stockholm
and
right
opposite
them
their
father
sits
rejoicing
in
the
thought
that
he
has
made
their
mother
unhappy
with
every
second
that
passes
the
thought
of
having
to
live
with
father
becomes
more
repellent
are
they
then
wholly
in
his
power
will
there
be
no
help
for
this
father
leans
back
in
his
seat
and
after
a
bit
he
falls
asleep
immediately
the
boys
begin
whispering
to
each
other
very
earnestly
it
is
difficult
for
them
to
come
to
a
decision
the
whole
day
they
have
been
sitting
there
thinking
that
they
ought
to
run
away
they
conclude
to
steal
out
on
the
platform
and
to
jump
from
the
train
when
it
goes
through
a
big
forest
then
they
will
build
them
a
hut
in
the
most
secluded
spot
in
the
forest
and
live
all
by
themselves
and
never
show
themselves
to
a
human
being
while
the
boys
are
laying
their
plans
the
train
stops
at
a
station
and
a
peasant
woman
leading
a
little
boy
by
the
hand
comes
into
the
coupé
she
is
dressed
in
black
with
a
shawl
on
her
head
and
has
a
kind
and
friendly
appearance
she
removes
the
little
one
overcoat
which
is
wet
from
the
rain
and
wraps
a
shawl
around
him
then
she
takes
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
dries
his
little
cold
feet
takes
from
a
bundle
dry
shoes
and
stockings
and
puts
them
on
him
then
she
gives
him
a
stick
of
candy
and
lays
him
down
on
the
seat
with
his
head
resting
on
her
lap
that
he
might
sleep
first
one
boy
then
the
other
casts
a
glance
over
at
the
peasant
woman
these
glances
become
more
frequent
and
suddenly
the
eyes
of
both
boys
fill
with
tears
then
they
look
up
no
more
but
keep
their
eyes
obstinately
lowered
it
seems
that
when
the
peasant
woman
entered
some
one
else
some
one
who
was
invisible
and
imperceptible
to
all
save
the
boys
came
into
the
coupé
the
boys
fancied
that
she
came
and
sat
down
between
them
and
took
their
hands
in
hers
as
she
had
done
late
last
night
when
it
was
settled
that
they
must
leave
her
and
she
was
talking
to
them
now
as
she
did
then
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
not
be
angry
with
father
for
my
sake
father
has
never
been
able
to
forgive
me
for
preventing
him
from
going
abroad
he
thinks
it
is
my
fault
that
he
has
never
amounted
to
anything
and
that
he
drinks
he
can
never
punish
me
enough
but
you
must
be
angry
at
him
on
that
account
now
when
you
are
to
live
with
father
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
be
kind
to
him
you
quarrel
with
him
and
you
are
to
look
after
his
needs
as
well
as
you
can
this
you
must
promise
me
otherwise
i
do
know
how
i
can
ever
let
you
go
and
the
boys
promised
you
must
run
away
from
father
promise
me
that
mother
had
said
that
they
had
also
promised
the
boys
are
as
good
as
their
word
and
the
instant
they
happen
to
think
that
they
had
given
mother
these
promises
they
abandon
all
thought
of
flight
father
sleeps
all
the
while
and
they
remain
patiently
in
their
places
then
they
resume
their
reading
with
redoubled
zeal
and
their
friend
the
good
jules
verne
soon
takes
them
away
from
many
heavy
sorrows
to
africa
happy
wonder
world
far
out
on
the
south
side
of
the
city
father
has
rented
two
rooms
and
a
kitchen
on
the
ground
floor
with
an
entrance
from
the
court
and
an
outlook
over
a
narrow
yard
the
apartment
has
long
been
in
use
it
has
gone
from
family
to
family
without
ever
having
been
renovated
the
wall
paper
is
full
of
tears
and
spots
the
ceilings
are
sooty
a
couple
of
are
cracked
and
the
kitchen
floor
is
so
worn
that
it
is
full
of
ruts
expressmen
have
brought
the
furniture
cases
from
the
railway
station
and
have
left
them
there
helter
skelter
father
and
the
boys
are
now
unpacking
father
stands
with
axe
raised
to
hack
open
a
box
the
boys
are
taking
out
glass
and
porcelain
ware
from
another
box
and
are
arranging
them
in
a
wall
cupboard
they
are
handy
and
work
eagerly
but
the
father
never
stops
cautioning
them
to
be
careful
and
forbids
their
carrying
more
than
one
glass
or
plate
at
a
time
meanwhile
it
goes
slowly
with
father
own
work
his
hands
are
fumbly
and
powerless
and
he
works
himself
into
a
sweat
without
getting
the
lock
off
the
box
he
lays
down
the
axe
walks
around
the
box
and
wonders
if
it
the
bottom
that
is
uppermost
then
one
of
the
boys
takes
hold
of
the
axe
and
begins
to
bend
the
lock
but
father
pushes
him
aside
that
lock
is
nailed
down
too
hard
surely
you
do
imagine
that
you
can
force
the
lock
when
father
could
do
it
only
a
regular
workman
can
open
that
box
says
father
putting
on
his
hat
and
coat
to
go
and
fetch
the
janitor
father
is
hardly
outside
the
door
when
an
idea
strikes
him
instantly
he
understands
why
he
has
no
strength
in
his
hands
it
is
still
quite
early
in
the
morning
and
he
has
not
consumed
anything
which
could
set
the
blood
in
motion
if
he
were
to
step
into
a
café
and
have
a
cognac
he
would
get
back
his
strength
and
could
manage
without
help
this
is
better
than
calling
the
janitor
then
father
goes
into
the
street
to
try
and
hunt
up
a
café
when
he
returns
to
the
little
apartment
on
the
court
it
is
eight
in
the
evening
in
father
youth
when
he
attended
the
academy
he
had
lived
at
the
south
end
of
the
city
he
was
then
a
member
of
a
double
quartette
mostly
made
up
of
choristers
and
petty
tradesmen
who
used
to
meet
in
a
cellar
near
mosebacke
father
had
taken
a
notion
to
go
and
see
if
the
little
cellar
was
still
there
it
was
in
fact
and
father
had
the
luck
to
run
across
a
pair
of
old
comrades
who
were
seated
there
having
their
breakfast
they
had
received
him
with
the
greatest
delight
had
invited
him
to
breakfast
and
had
celebrated
his
advent
in
stockholm
in
the
friendliest
way
possible
when
the
breakfast
was
over
finally
father
wanted
to
go
home
and
unpack
his
furniture
but
his
friends
persuaded
him
to
remain
and
take
dinner
with
them
this
function
was
so
long
drawn
out
that
he
had
been
able
to
go
home
until
around
eight
and
it
had
cost
him
more
than
a
slight
effort
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
lively
place
that
early
when
father
comes
home
the
boys
are
in
the
dark
for
they
have
no
matches
father
has
a
match
in
his
pocket
and
when
he
has
lighted
a
little
stump
of
a
candle
which
luckily
had
come
along
with
their
furnishings
he
sees
that
the
boys
are
hot
and
dusty
but
well
and
happy
and
apparently
very
well
pleased
with
their
day
in
the
rooms
the
furniture
is
arranged
alongside
the
walls
the
boxes
have
been
removed
and
straw
and
papers
have
been
swept
away
hugo
is
just
turning
down
the
boys
beds
in
the
outer
room
the
inner
room
is
to
be
father
bedroom
and
there
stands
his
bed
turned
down
with
as
great
care
as
he
could
possibly
wish
now
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
possesses
him
when
he
came
home
he
was
displeased
with
himself
because
he
had
gone
away
from
his
work
and
had
left
the
boys
without
food
but
now
when
he
sees
that
they
are
in
good
spirits
and
not
in
any
distress
he
regrets
that
for
their
sakes
he
should
have
left
his
friends
and
he
becomes
irritable
and
quarrelsome
he
sees
no
doubt
that
the
boys
are
proud
of
all
the
work
they
have
accomplished
and
expect
him
to
praise
them
but
this
he
is
not
at
all
inclined
to
do
instead
he
asks
who
has
been
here
and
helped
them
and
begs
them
to
remember
that
here
in
stockholm
one
gets
nothing
without
money
and
that
the
janitor
must
be
paid
for
all
he
does
the
boys
answer
that
they
have
had
no
assistance
and
have
got
on
by
themselves
but
father
continues
to
grumble
it
was
wrong
of
them
to
open
the
big
box
they
might
have
hurt
themselves
on
it
had
he
not
forbidden
them
to
open
it
now
they
would
have
to
obey
him
he
is
the
one
who
must
answer
for
their
welfare
he
takes
the
candle
goes
out
into
the
kitchen
and
peeps
into
the
cupboards
the
scanty
supply
of
glass
and
porcelain
is
arranged
on
the
shelves
in
an
orderly
manner
he
scrutinizes
everything
very
carefully
to
find
an
excuse
for
further
complaint
all
of
a
sudden
he
catches
sight
of
some
leavings
from
the
boys
supper
and
begins
immediately
to
grumble
because
they
have
had
chicken
where
did
they
get
it
from
do
they
think
of
living
like
princes
is
it
his
money
they
are
throwing
away
on
chicken
then
he
remembers
that
he
had
not
left
them
any
money
he
wonders
if
they
have
stolen
the
chicken
and
becomes
perturbed
he
preaches
and
admonishes
scolds
and
fusses
but
now
he
gets
no
response
from
the
boys
they
do
not
bother
themselves
about
telling
him
where
they
got
the
chicken
but
let
him
go
on
he
makes
long
speeches
and
exhausts
his
forces
finally
he
begs
and
implores
i
beseech
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
forgive
you
no
matter
what
you
have
done
if
you
will
only
tell
me
the
truth
now
the
boys
can
hold
in
no
longer
father
hears
a
spluttering
sound
they
throw
off
the
quilts
and
sit
up
and
he
notices
that
they
are
purple
in
the
face
from
suppressed
laughter
and
as
they
can
laugh
now
without
restraint
lennart
says
between
the
paroxysms
mother
put
a
chicken
in
the
food
sack
which
she
gave
us
when
we
left
home
father
draws
himself
up
looks
at
the
boys
wants
to
speak
but
finds
no
suitable
words
he
becomes
even
more
majestic
in
his
bearing
looks
with
withering
scorn
at
them
and
goes
to
his
room
without
further
parley
it
has
dawned
upon
father
how
handy
the
boys
are
and
he
makes
use
of
this
fact
to
escape
hiring
servants
mornings
he
sends
lennart
into
the
kitchen
to
make
coffee
and
lets
hugo
lay
the
and
fetch
bread
from
the
baker
after
breakfast
he
sits
down
on
a
chair
and
watches
how
the
boys
make
up
the
beds
sweep
the
floors
and
build
a
fire
in
the
grate
he
gives
endless
orders
and
sends
them
from
one
task
to
another
only
to
show
his
authority
when
the
morning
chores
are
over
he
goes
out
and
remains
away
all
the
forenoon
the
dinner
he
lets
them
fetch
from
a
in
the
neighborhood
after
dinner
he
leaves
the
boys
for
the
evening
and
exacts
nothing
more
of
them
than
that
his
bed
shall
be
turned
down
when
he
comes
home
the
boys
are
practically
alone
almost
the
entire
day
and
can
busy
themselves
in
any
way
they
choose
one
of
their
most
important
tasks
is
to
write
to
their
mother
they
get
letters
from
her
every
day
and
she
sends
them
paper
and
postage
so
that
they
can
answer
her
mother
letters
are
mostly
admonitions
that
they
shall
be
good
to
their
father
she
writes
constantly
of
how
lovable
father
was
when
she
first
knew
him
of
how
industrious
and
thrifty
he
was
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
they
must
be
tender
and
kind
to
him
they
must
never
forget
how
unhappy
he
is
if
you
are
very
good
to
father
perhaps
he
may
feel
sorry
for
you
and
let
you
come
home
to
me
mother
tells
them
that
she
has
called
to
see
the
dean
and
the
burgomaster
to
ask
if
it
were
not
possible
to
get
back
the
boys
both
of
them
had
replied
that
there
was
no
help
for
her
the
boys
would
have
to
stay
with
their
father
mother
wants
to
move
to
stockholm
that
she
may
see
her
boys
once
in
a
while
at
least
but
every
one
advises
her
to
have
patience
and
abide
her
time
they
think
father
will
soon
tire
of
the
boys
and
send
them
home
mother
does
quite
know
what
she
should
do
on
the
one
hand
she
thinks
it
dreadful
that
the
boys
are
living
in
stockholm
with
no
one
to
look
after
them
and
on
the
other
hand
she
knows
that
if
she
were
to
leave
her
home
and
her
work
she
could
not
take
them
and
support
them
even
if
they
were
freed
but
for
christmas
at
all
events
mother
is
coming
to
stockholm
to
look
after
them
the
boys
write
and
tell
her
what
they
do
all
day
hour
by
hour
they
let
mother
know
that
they
cook
for
father
and
make
his
bed
she
apprehends
that
they
are
trying
to
be
kind
to
him
for
her
sake
but
she
probably
perceives
that
they
like
him
no
better
now
than
formerly
her
little
boys
appear
to
be
always
alone
they
live
in
a
large
city
where
there
are
lots
of
people
but
no
one
asks
after
them
and
perhaps
it
is
better
thus
who
can
tell
what
might
happen
to
them
were
they
to
make
any
acquaintances
they
always
beg
of
her
not
to
be
uneasy
about
them
they
tell
how
they
darn
their
stockings
and
sew
on
their
buttons
they
also
intimate
that
lennart
has
made
great
headway
with
his
invention
and
say
that
when
this
is
finished
all
will
be
well
mother
lives
in
a
state
of
continual
fear
night
and
day
her
thoughts
are
with
her
boys
night
and
day
she
prays
god
to
watch
over
her
little
sons
who
live
alone
in
a
great
city
with
no
one
to
shield
them
from
the
temptations
of
the
destroyer
and
to
keep
their
young
hearts
from
the
desire
for
evil
father
and
the
boys
are
sitting
one
morning
at
the
opera
one
of
father
old
comrades
who
is
with
the
royal
orchestra
has
invited
him
to
be
present
at
a
symphony
rehearsal
and
father
has
taken
the
boys
along
when
the
orchestra
strikes
up
and
the
auditorium
is
filled
with
tone
father
is
so
affected
that
he
ca
control
himself
and
begins
to
weep
he
sobs
and
blows
his
nose
and
moans
aloud
time
and
again
he
puts
no
restraint
upon
his
feelings
but
makes
such
a
noise
that
the
musicians
are
disturbed
a
guard
comes
along
and
beckons
him
away
and
father
takes
the
boys
by
the
hand
and
slinks
out
without
a
word
of
protest
all
the
way
home
his
tears
continue
to
flow
father
is
walking
on
with
a
boy
on
each
side
and
he
has
kept
their
hands
in
his
all
the
while
suddenly
the
boys
start
crying
they
understand
now
for
the
first
time
how
much
father
has
loved
his
art
it
was
painful
for
him
to
sit
there
besotten
and
broken
and
listen
to
others
playing
they
feel
sorry
for
him
who
had
never
become
what
he
might
have
been
it
was
with
father
as
it
might
be
with
lennart
were
he
never
to
finish
his
or
with
hugo
if
he
were
not
to
make
any
voyages
of
discovery
think
if
they
should
one
day
sit
like
old
and
see
fine
airships
sailing
over
their
heads
which
they
had
not
invented
and
were
not
allowed
to
pilot
the
boys
were
sitting
one
morning
on
opposite
sides
of
the
father
had
taken
a
music
roll
under
his
arm
and
gone
out
he
had
mumbled
something
about
giving
a
music
lesson
but
the
boys
had
not
for
a
moment
been
tempted
into
believing
this
true
father
is
in
an
ugly
mood
as
he
walks
up
the
street
he
noticed
the
look
the
boys
exchanged
when
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
a
music
lesson
they
are
setting
themselves
up
as
judges
of
their
father
he
thinks
i
am
too
indulgent
toward
them
i
should
have
given
them
each
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
it
their
mother
i
dare
say
who
is
setting
them
against
me
suppose
i
were
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
fine
gentlemen
he
continues
it
would
do
no
harm
to
find
out
how
they
attend
to
their
lessons
he
turns
back
walks
quietly
across
the
court
opens
the
door
very
softly
and
stands
in
the
boys
room
without
either
of
them
having
heard
him
coming
the
boys
jump
up
red
in
the
face
and
lennart
quickly
snatches
a
bundle
of
papers
which
he
throws
into
the
table
drawer
when
the
boys
had
been
in
stockholm
a
day
or
two
they
had
asked
which
school
they
were
to
attend
and
the
father
had
replied
that
their
days
were
over
now
he
would
try
and
procure
a
private
tutor
who
would
teach
them
this
proposition
he
had
never
carried
into
effect
nor
had
the
boys
said
anything
more
about
going
to
school
but
in
less
than
a
week
a
school
chart
was
discovered
hanging
on
the
wall
in
the
boys
room
the
school
books
had
been
brought
forth
and
every
morning
they
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
an
old
and
studied
their
lessons
aloud
it
was
evident
that
they
had
received
letters
from
their
mother
counselling
them
to
try
and
study
so
as
not
to
forget
entirely
what
they
had
learned
now
as
father
unexpectedly
comes
into
the
room
he
goes
up
to
the
chart
first
and
studies
it
he
takes
out
his
watch
and
compares
wednesday
between
ten
and
eleven
geography
then
he
comes
up
to
the
table
should
you
have
geography
at
this
hour
yes
the
boys
reply
growing
in
the
face
have
you
the
geography
and
the
map
the
boys
glance
over
at
the
book
shelf
and
look
confused
we
begun
yet
says
lennart
indeed
says
father
you
must
have
been
up
to
something
else
he
straightens
up
thoroughly
pleased
with
himself
he
has
an
advantage
which
he
does
care
to
let
go
until
he
has
browbeaten
them
very
effectually
both
boys
are
silent
ever
since
the
day
they
accompanied
father
to
the
opera
they
have
felt
sympathy
for
him
and
it
has
not
been
such
an
effort
for
them
to
be
kind
to
him
as
it
was
before
but
naturally
they
have
for
a
moment
thought
of
taking
father
into
their
confidence
he
has
not
risen
in
their
estimation
although
they
are
sorry
for
him
were
you
writing
letters
father
asks
in
his
severest
tone
no
say
both
boys
at
the
same
time
what
were
you
doing
oh
just
talking
that
is
true
i
saw
that
lennart
hid
something
in
the
drawer
of
the
table
now
both
boys
are
mum
again
take
it
out
shouts
the
father
purple
with
rage
he
thinks
the
sons
have
written
to
his
wife
and
since
they
do
care
to
show
the
letter
of
course
there
is
something
mean
about
him
in
it
the
boys
do
not
stir
and
father
raises
his
hand
to
strike
lennart
who
is
sitting
before
the
table
drawer
do
touch
him
cries
hugo
we
were
only
talking
over
something
which
lennart
has
invented
hugo
pushes
lennart
aside
opens
the
drawer
and
pulls
out
the
paper
which
is
scrawled
full
of
airships
of
the
most
extraordinary
shapes
last
night
lennart
thought
out
a
new
kind
of
sail
for
his
airship
it
was
of
this
we
were
speaking
father
would
believe
him
he
bends
over
searches
in
the
drawer
but
finds
only
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
drawings
of
balloons
parachutes
and
everything
else
appertaining
to
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
boys
father
does
not
cast
this
aside
at
once
nor
does
he
laugh
at
their
attempts
but
examines
closely
sheet
after
sheet
as
a
matter
of
fact
father
too
has
a
little
leaning
toward
mechanics
and
was
interested
in
things
of
this
sort
in
days
gone
by
when
his
brain
was
still
good
for
something
soon
he
begins
to
ask
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
one
thing
and
another
and
inasmuch
as
his
words
betray
that
he
is
deeply
interested
and
understands
what
he
sees
lennart
fights
his
bashfulness
and
answers
him
hesitatingly
at
first
and
then
more
willingly
soon
father
and
boys
are
absorbed
in
a
profound
discussion
about
airships
and
after
they
are
fairly
well
started
the
boys
chatter
unreservedly
and
give
father
a
share
in
their
plans
and
dreams
of
greatness
and
while
the
father
comprehends
of
course
that
the
boys
can
not
fly
very
far
with
the
airship
which
they
have
constructed
he
is
very
much
impressed
his
little
sons
talk
of
aluminum
motors
aeroplanes
and
balancers
as
though
they
were
the
simplest
things
in
the
world
he
had
thought
them
regular
blockheads
because
they
get
on
very
fast
at
school
now
all
at
once
he
believes
they
are
a
pair
of
little
scientists
the
thoughts
and
aspirations
father
understands
better
than
anything
else
he
cognizes
them
he
himself
has
dreamed
in
the
same
way
and
he
has
no
desire
to
laugh
at
such
dreams
father
does
go
out
again
that
morning
but
sits
and
chats
with
the
boys
until
it
is
time
to
fetch
the
food
for
dinner
and
set
the
table
and
at
that
meal
father
and
the
boys
are
real
good
friends
to
their
great
and
mutual
astonishment
the
hour
is
eleven
at
night
and
father
is
staggering
up
the
street
the
little
boys
are
walking
on
either
side
of
him
and
he
holds
their
hands
tightly
clasped
in
his
all
the
while
they
have
sought
him
out
in
one
of
his
haunts
where
they
have
stationed
themselves
just
inside
the
door
father
sits
by
himself
at
a
table
with
a
big
brown
toddy
in
front
of
him
and
listens
to
a
ladies
orchestra
which
is
playing
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
after
a
hesitancy
he
rises
reluctantly
and
goes
over
to
the
boys
what
is
it
he
asks
why
do
you
come
here
father
was
to
come
home
they
say
this
is
the
fifth
of
december
father
promised
then
he
remembers
that
lennart
had
confided
to
him
that
it
was
birthday
and
that
he
had
promised
him
to
come
home
early
but
this
he
had
entirely
forgotten
hugo
was
probably
expecting
a
birthday
present
from
him
but
he
had
not
remembered
to
get
him
one
at
any
rate
he
has
gone
with
the
boys
and
is
walking
along
displeased
with
them
and
with
himself
when
he
comes
home
the
birthday
table
is
laid
the
boys
had
wished
to
give
a
little
party
lennart
had
creamed
some
pancakes
which
are
now
a
few
hours
old
and
look
like
pieces
of
leather
they
had
received
a
little
money
from
their
mother
and
with
this
they
had
bought
nuts
raisins
and
a
bottle
of
this
fine
feast
they
did
not
care
to
enjoy
all
by
themselves
and
they
had
been
sitting
and
waiting
for
father
to
come
home
and
share
it
with
them
now
since
they
and
father
have
become
friends
they
can
not
celebrate
such
a
big
event
without
him
father
understands
it
all
and
the
thought
of
being
missed
flatters
him
and
puts
him
in
a
fairly
good
humor
half
full
as
he
is
he
plumps
himself
down
at
the
table
just
as
he
is
about
to
take
his
place
he
stumbles
clutches
at
the
falls
and
draws
down
on
the
floor
everything
on
the
table
as
he
raises
himself
he
sees
how
the
soda
flows
out
over
the
floor
and
pickles
and
pancakes
are
strewn
about
among
bits
of
porcelain
and
broken
glass
father
glances
at
the
boys
long
faces
rips
out
an
oath
and
makes
a
rush
for
the
door
and
he
does
come
back
home
until
on
towards
morning
one
morning
in
february
the
boys
are
coming
up
the
street
with
their
skates
dangling
from
their
shoulders
they
are
not
quite
like
themselves
they
have
grown
thin
and
pale
and
look
untidy
and
uncared
for
their
hair
is
uncut
they
are
not
well
washed
and
they
have
holes
in
both
stockings
and
shoes
when
they
address
each
other
they
use
a
lot
of
expressions
and
one
and
another
oath
escapes
from
their
lips
a
change
has
taken
place
in
the
boys
it
had
its
beginning
on
the
evening
when
their
father
forgot
to
come
home
to
help
celebrate
birthday
it
was
as
if
until
that
time
they
had
been
kept
up
by
the
hope
that
soon
their
father
would
be
a
changed
man
at
first
they
had
counted
on
his
tiring
of
them
and
sending
them
home
later
they
had
fancied
that
he
would
become
fond
of
them
and
give
up
drinking
for
their
sakes
and
they
had
even
imagined
that
mother
and
he
might
become
reconciled
and
that
all
of
them
would
be
happy
but
it
dawned
upon
them
that
night
that
father
was
impossible
he
could
love
nothing
but
drink
even
if
he
were
kind
to
them
for
a
little
while
he
did
really
care
for
them
a
heavy
hopelessness
fell
upon
the
boys
nothing
would
ever
be
changed
for
them
they
should
never
get
away
from
father
they
felt
as
though
they
were
doomed
to
sit
shut
in
a
dark
prison
all
their
lives
not
even
their
great
plans
for
the
future
could
comfort
them
in
the
way
that
they
were
bound
down
these
plans
could
never
be
carried
out
only
think
they
were
not
learning
anything
they
knew
enough
of
the
histories
of
great
men
to
know
that
he
who
wants
to
accomplish
anything
noteworthy
must
first
of
all
have
knowledge
still
the
hardest
blow
was
that
mother
did
not
come
to
them
at
christmas
in
the
beginning
of
december
she
had
fallen
down
stairs
and
broken
her
leg
and
was
forced
to
lie
in
a
hospital
during
the
christmas
holidays
therefore
she
could
not
come
to
stockholm
now
that
mother
was
up
her
school
had
begun
again
apart
from
this
she
had
no
money
with
which
to
travel
the
little
that
she
had
saved
was
spent
while
she
lay
ill
the
boys
felt
themselves
deserted
by
the
whole
world
it
was
obvious
that
it
never
would
be
any
better
for
them
no
matter
how
good
they
were
so
gradually
they
ceased
to
exert
themselves
with
the
sort
of
things
that
were
tiresome
they
might
just
as
well
do
that
which
amused
them
the
boys
began
to
shirk
their
morning
studies
no
one
heard
their
lessons
so
what
was
the
use
of
their
studying
there
had
been
good
skating
for
a
couple
of
days
and
they
might
as
well
play
truant
all
day
on
the
ice
there
were
always
throngs
of
boys
and
they
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
number
who
also
preferred
skating
to
being
shut
in
the
house
with
their
books
it
has
turned
out
to
be
such
a
fine
day
that
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
staying
indoors
the
weather
is
so
clear
and
sunny
that
the
school
children
have
been
granted
skating
leave
the
whole
street
is
filled
with
children
who
have
been
home
to
get
their
skates
and
are
now
hurrying
down
to
the
ice
the
boys
as
they
move
among
the
other
children
appear
solemn
and
not
a
smile
lights
up
their
faces
their
misfortune
is
so
heavy
that
they
can
not
forget
it
for
a
second
when
they
come
down
on
the
ice
it
is
full
of
life
and
movement
all
along
the
edges
it
is
bordered
with
a
tight
mass
of
people
farther
out
the
skaters
circle
around
one
another
like
gnats
and
still
farther
out
solitary
black
specks
that
float
along
at
lightning
speed
are
seen
the
boys
buckle
on
their
skates
and
join
the
other
skaters
they
skate
very
well
and
as
they
glide
out
on
the
ice
full
speed
they
get
color
in
their
cheeks
and
their
eyes
sparkle
but
not
for
a
moment
do
they
appear
happy
like
other
children
all
of
a
sudden
as
they
are
making
a
turn
toward
land
they
catch
sight
of
something
very
pretty
a
big
balloon
comes
from
the
direction
of
stockholm
and
is
sailing
out
toward
salt
lake
it
is
striped
in
reds
and
yellows
and
when
the
sun
strikes
it
it
glitters
like
a
ball
of
fire
the
basket
is
decorated
with
flags
and
as
the
balloon
does
not
fly
very
high
the
bright
can
be
seen
quite
plainly
when
the
boys
spy
the
balloon
they
send
up
a
shriek
of
delight
it
is
the
first
time
in
their
lives
that
they
have
seen
a
big
balloon
sailing
through
the
air
all
the
dreams
and
plans
which
have
been
their
consolation
and
joy
during
the
many
trying
days
come
back
to
them
when
they
see
it
they
stand
still
that
they
may
observe
how
the
ropes
and
lines
are
fastened
and
they
take
note
of
the
anchor
and
the
sand
bags
on
the
edge
of
the
car
the
balloon
moves
with
good
speed
over
the
fiord
all
the
skaters
big
and
little
dart
around
one
another
laughing
and
hooting
at
it
when
it
first
comes
into
sight
and
then
they
bound
after
it
they
follow
it
out
to
sea
in
a
long
swaying
line
like
a
drag
line
the
amuse
themselves
by
scattering
handfuls
of
paper
strips
in
a
variety
of
colors
which
come
circling
down
slowly
through
the
blue
air
the
boys
are
foremost
in
the
long
line
that
is
chasing
after
the
balloon
they
hurry
forward
with
heads
thrown
back
and
gaze
steadily
turned
upward
their
eyes
dance
with
delight
for
the
first
time
since
they
parted
from
their
mother
they
are
beside
themselves
with
excitement
over
the
airship
and
think
of
nothing
else
than
to
follow
it
as
long
as
possible
but
the
balloon
moves
ahead
rapidly
and
one
has
to
be
a
good
skater
not
to
be
left
behind
the
crowd
chasing
after
it
thins
down
but
in
the
lead
of
those
who
keep
up
the
pursuit
the
two
little
boys
are
seen
afterwards
people
said
there
was
something
strange
about
them
they
neither
laughed
nor
shouted
but
on
their
upturned
faces
there
was
a
look
of
transport
as
though
they
had
seen
a
heavenly
vision
the
balloon
also
affects
the
boys
like
a
celestial
guide
who
has
come
to
lead
them
back
to
the
right
path
and
teach
them
how
to
go
forward
with
renewed
courage
when
the
boys
see
it
their
hearts
bound
with
longing
to
begin
work
again
on
the
great
invention
once
more
they
feel
confident
and
happy
if
only
they
are
patient
they
probably
work
their
way
toward
success
a
day
will
surely
come
when
they
can
step
into
their
own
airship
and
soar
aloft
in
space
some
day
will
be
the
ones
who
travel
up
there
far
above
the
people
and
airship
will
be
more
perfect
than
the
one
they
now
see
theirs
shall
be
an
airship
that
can
be
steered
and
turned
lowered
and
raised
sail
against
wind
and
without
wind
it
shall
carry
them
by
day
and
by
night
wherever
they
may
wish
to
travel
they
shall
descend
to
the
highest
mountain
peaks
travel
over
the
dreariest
deserts
and
explore
the
most
inaccessible
regions
they
shall
behold
all
the
glories
of
the
world
it
is
worth
while
to
lose
heart
hugo
says
lennart
we
have
a
fine
time
if
we
can
only
finish
it
father
and
his
are
things
which
do
not
concern
them
any
more
one
who
has
something
as
great
to
strive
for
as
they
have
can
not
let
himself
be
hindered
by
anything
so
pitiable
the
balloon
gains
in
speed
the
farther
out
it
comes
the
skaters
have
ceased
following
it
the
only
ones
who
continue
the
chase
are
the
two
little
boys
they
move
ahead
as
swiftly
and
lightly
as
if
their
feet
had
taken
on
wings
suddenly
the
people
who
stand
on
the
shore
and
can
look
far
out
across
the
fiord
send
up
a
great
cry
of
horror
and
fear
they
see
that
the
balloon
pursued
all
the
while
by
the
two
children
sails
away
toward
the
fairway
where
there
is
open
sea
open
sea
it
is
open
sea
out
there
the
people
shout
the
skaters
down
on
the
ice
hear
the
shouts
and
turn
their
eyes
toward
the
mouth
of
the
fiord
they
see
how
a
strip
of
water
shimmers
in
the
sunlight
yonder
they
see
also
that
two
little
boys
are
skating
toward
this
strip
which
they
do
not
notice
because
their
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
balloon
and
not
for
a
second
do
they
turn
them
toward
earth
the
people
are
calling
out
with
all
their
might
and
stamping
on
the
ice
fast
runners
are
hurrying
on
to
stop
them
but
the
little
ones
mark
nothing
of
all
this
where
they
are
chasing
after
the
airship
they
do
not
know
that
they
alone
are
following
it
they
hear
no
cries
back
of
them
they
do
not
hear
the
splash
and
roar
of
the
water
ahead
of
them
they
see
only
the
balloon
which
as
it
were
carries
them
with
it
lennart
already
feels
his
own
airship
rising
under
him
and
hugo
soars
away
over
the
north
pole
the
people
on
the
ice
and
on
the
shore
see
how
rapidly
they
are
nearing
the
open
sea
for
a
second
or
two
they
are
in
such
breathless
suspense
that
they
can
neither
move
nor
cry
out
it
seems
as
if
the
two
children
are
under
a
magic
spell
in
their
chase
after
a
shining
heavenly
vision
the
up
in
the
balloon
have
also
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
little
boys
they
see
that
they
are
in
danger
and
scream
at
them
and
make
warning
gestures
but
the
boys
do
not
understand
them
when
they
notice
that
the
are
making
signs
at
them
they
think
they
want
to
take
them
up
into
the
car
they
stretch
their
arms
toward
them
overjoyed
in
the
hope
of
accompanying
them
through
the
bright
upper
regions
at
this
moment
the
boys
have
reached
the
sailing
channel
and
with
arms
uplifted
they
skate
down
into
the
water
and
disappear
without
a
cry
for
help
the
skaters
who
have
tried
to
reach
them
in
time
are
standing
a
couple
of
seconds
later
on
the
edge
of
the
ice
but
the
current
has
carried
their
bodies
under
the
ice
and
no
helping
hand
can
reach
them
the
wedding
march
now
i
going
to
tell
a
pretty
story
a
good
many
years
ago
there
was
to
be
a
very
big
wedding
at
svartsjö
parish
in
vermland
first
there
was
to
be
a
church
ceremony
and
after
that
three
days
of
feasting
and
merrymaking
and
every
day
while
the
festivities
lasted
there
was
to
be
dancing
from
early
morning
till
far
into
the
night
since
there
was
to
be
so
much
dancing
it
was
of
very
great
importance
to
get
a
good
fiddler
and
juryman
nils
olafsson
who
was
managing
the
wedding
worried
almost
more
over
this
than
over
anything
else
the
fiddler
they
had
at
svartsjö
he
did
not
care
to
engage
his
name
was
jan
öster
the
juryman
knew
to
be
sure
that
he
had
quite
a
big
name
but
he
was
so
poor
that
sometimes
he
would
appear
at
a
wedding
in
a
frayed
jacket
and
without
shoes
to
his
feet
the
juryman
did
wish
to
see
such
a
ragtag
at
the
head
of
the
bridal
procession
so
he
decided
to
send
a
messenger
to
a
musician
in
jösse
parish
who
was
commonly
called
fiddler
mårten
and
ask
him
if
he
would
come
and
play
at
the
wedding
fiddler
mårten
did
consider
the
proposition
for
a
second
but
promptly
replied
that
he
did
not
want
to
play
at
svartsjö
because
in
that
parish
lived
a
musician
who
was
more
skilled
than
all
others
in
vermland
while
they
had
him
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
call
another
when
nils
olafsson
received
this
answer
he
took
a
few
days
to
think
it
over
and
then
he
sent
word
to
a
fiddler
in
big
kil
parish
named
olle
in
säby
to
ask
him
if
he
would
come
and
play
at
his
wedding
olle
in
säby
answered
in
the
same
way
as
fiddler
mårten
he
sent
his
compliments
to
nils
olafsson
and
said
that
so
long
as
there
was
such
a
capable
musician
as
jan
öster
to
be
had
in
svartsjö
he
did
want
to
go
there
to
play
nils
olafsson
did
like
it
that
the
musicians
tried
in
this
way
to
force
upon
him
the
very
one
he
did
not
want
now
he
considered
that
it
was
a
point
of
honor
with
him
to
get
another
fiddler
than
jan
öster
a
few
days
after
he
had
the
answer
from
olle
in
säby
he
sent
his
servant
to
fiddler
lars
larsson
who
lived
at
the
game
lodge
in
ullerud
parish
lars
larsson
was
a
man
who
owned
a
fine
farm
he
was
sensible
and
considerate
and
no
hotspur
like
the
other
musicians
but
lars
larsson
like
the
others
at
once
thought
of
jan
öster
and
asked
how
it
happened
that
he
was
not
to
play
at
the
wedding
nils
olafsson
servant
thought
it
best
to
say
to
him
that
since
jan
öster
lived
at
svartsjö
they
could
hear
him
play
at
any
time
as
nils
olafsson
was
making
ready
to
give
a
grand
wedding
he
wished
to
treat
his
guests
to
something
a
little
better
and
more
select
i
doubt
if
you
can
get
any
one
better
said
lars
larsson
now
you
must
be
thinking
of
answering
in
the
same
way
as
fiddler
mårten
and
olle
in
säby
did
said
the
servant
then
he
told
him
how
he
had
fared
with
them
lars
larsson
paid
close
attention
to
the
servant
story
and
then
he
sat
quietly
for
a
long
while
and
pondered
finally
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
tell
your
master
that
i
thank
him
for
his
invitation
and
will
come
the
following
sunday
lars
larsson
journeyed
down
to
svartsjö
he
drove
up
to
the
church
knoll
just
as
the
wedding
guests
were
forming
into
line
to
march
to
the
church
he
came
driving
in
his
own
chaise
and
with
a
good
horse
and
dressed
in
black
broadcloth
he
took
out
his
fiddle
from
a
highly
polished
box
nils
olafsson
received
him
effusively
thinking
that
here
was
a
fiddler
of
whom
he
might
be
proud
immediately
after
lars
larsson
arrival
jan
öster
too
came
marching
up
to
the
church
with
his
fiddle
under
his
arm
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
crowd
around
the
bride
exactly
as
if
he
were
asked
to
come
and
play
at
the
wedding
jan
öster
had
come
in
the
old
gray
homespun
jacket
which
they
had
seen
him
wearing
for
ages
but
as
this
was
to
be
such
a
grand
wedding
his
wife
had
made
an
attempt
at
mending
the
holes
at
the
elbow
by
sewing
big
green
patches
over
them
jan
öster
was
a
tall
handsome
man
and
would
have
made
a
fine
appearance
at
the
head
of
the
bridal
procession
had
he
not
been
so
shabbily
dressed
and
had
his
face
not
been
so
lined
and
seamed
by
worries
and
the
hard
struggle
with
misfortune
when
lars
larsson
saw
jan
öster
coming
he
seemed
a
bit
displeased
so
you
have
called
jan
öster
too
he
said
under
his
breath
to
the
juryman
nils
olafsson
but
at
a
grand
wedding
there
no
harm
in
having
two
fiddlers
i
did
not
invite
him
that
certain
protested
nils
olafsson
i
ca
comprehend
why
he
has
come
just
wait
and
i
let
him
know
that
he
has
no
business
here
then
some
practical
joker
must
have
bidden
him
said
lars
larsson
but
if
you
care
to
be
guided
by
my
counsel
appear
as
if
nothing
were
wrong
and
go
over
and
bid
him
welcome
i
have
heard
said
that
he
is
a
man
and
who
knows
but
he
may
begin
to
quarrel
and
fight
if
you
were
to
tell
him
that
he
was
not
invited
this
the
juryman
knew
too
it
was
no
time
to
begin
fussing
when
the
bridal
procession
was
forming
on
the
church
grounds
so
he
walked
up
to
jan
öster
and
bade
him
be
welcome
thereupon
the
two
fiddlers
took
their
places
at
the
head
of
the
procession
the
bridal
pair
walked
under
a
canopy
the
bridesmaids
and
the
groomsmen
marched
in
pairs
and
after
them
came
the
parents
and
relatives
so
the
procession
was
both
imposing
and
long
when
everything
was
in
readiness
a
groomsman
stepped
up
to
the
musicians
and
asked
them
to
play
the
wedding
march
both
musicians
swung
their
fiddles
up
to
their
chins
but
beyond
that
they
did
not
get
and
thus
they
stood
it
was
an
old
custom
in
svartsjö
for
the
best
fiddler
to
strike
up
the
wedding
march
and
to
lead
the
music
the
groomsman
looked
at
lars
larsson
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
him
to
start
but
lars
larsson
looked
at
jan
öster
and
said
it
is
you
jan
öster
who
must
begin
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
jan
öster
that
the
other
fiddler
who
was
as
finely
dressed
as
any
gentleman
should
not
be
better
than
himself
who
had
come
in
his
old
homespun
jacket
straight
from
the
wretched
hovel
where
there
were
only
poverty
and
distress
no
indeed
said
he
no
indeed
he
saw
that
the
bridegroom
put
forth
his
hand
and
touched
lars
larsson
larsson
shall
begin
said
he
when
jan
öster
heard
the
bridegroom
say
this
he
promptly
lowered
his
fiddle
and
stepped
aside
lars
larsson
on
the
other
hand
did
not
move
from
the
spot
but
remained
standing
in
his
place
confident
and
pleased
with
himself
nor
did
he
raise
the
bow
it
is
jan
öster
who
shall
begin
he
repeated
stubbornly
and
resistingly
as
one
who
is
used
to
having
his
own
way
there
was
some
commotion
among
the
crowds
over
the
cause
of
the
delay
the
bride
father
came
forward
and
begged
lars
larsson
to
begin
the
sexton
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
church
and
beckoned
to
them
to
hurry
along
the
parson
stood
waiting
at
the
altar
you
can
ask
jan
öster
to
begin
then
said
lars
larsson
we
musicians
consider
him
to
be
the
best
among
us
that
may
be
so
said
a
peasant
but
we
peasants
consider
you
the
best
one
then
the
other
peasants
also
gathered
around
them
well
begin
why
do
you
they
said
the
parson
is
waiting
we
become
a
to
the
church
people
lars
larsson
stood
there
quite
as
stubborn
and
determined
as
before
i
ca
see
why
the
people
in
this
parish
are
so
opposed
to
having
their
own
fiddler
placed
in
the
lead
nils
olafsson
was
perfectly
furious
because
they
wished
in
this
way
to
force
jan
öster
upon
him
he
came
close
up
to
lars
larsson
and
whispered
i
comprehend
that
it
is
you
who
have
called
hither
jan
öster
and
that
you
have
arranged
this
to
do
him
honor
but
be
quick
now
and
play
up
or
i
drive
that
ragamuffin
from
the
church
grounds
in
disgrace
and
by
force
lars
larsson
looked
him
square
in
the
face
and
nodded
to
him
without
displaying
any
irritation
yes
you
are
right
in
saying
that
we
must
have
an
end
of
this
said
he
he
beckoned
to
jan
öster
to
return
to
his
place
then
he
himself
walked
forward
a
step
or
two
and
turned
around
that
all
might
see
him
then
he
flung
the
bow
far
from
him
pulled
out
his
and
cut
all
four
violin
strings
which
snapped
with
a
sharp
twang
it
shall
not
be
said
of
me
that
i
count
myself
better
than
jan
öster
said
he
it
appears
that
for
three
years
jan
öster
had
been
musing
on
an
air
which
he
could
get
out
over
the
strings
because
at
home
he
was
bound
down
by
dull
gray
cares
and
worries
and
nothing
ever
happened
to
him
either
great
or
small
to
lift
him
above
the
daily
grind
but
when
he
heard
lars
larsson
strings
snap
he
threw
back
his
head
and
filled
his
lungs
his
features
were
rapt
as
though
he
were
listening
to
something
far
away
and
then
he
began
to
play
and
the
air
which
he
had
been
musing
over
for
three
years
became
all
at
once
clear
to
him
and
as
the
tones
of
it
vibrated
he
walked
with
proud
step
down
to
the
church
the
bridal
procession
had
never
before
heard
an
air
like
that
it
carried
them
along
with
such
speed
that
not
even
nils
olafsson
could
think
of
staying
back
and
every
one
was
so
pleased
both
with
jan
öster
and
with
lars
larsson
that
the
entire
following
entered
the
church
their
eyes
brimming
with
tears
of
joy
the
musician
no
one
in
ullerud
could
say
anything
of
fiddler
lars
larsson
but
that
he
was
both
meek
and
modest
in
his
later
years
but
he
had
not
always
been
thus
it
seems
in
his
youth
he
had
been
so
overbearing
and
boastful
that
people
were
in
despair
about
him
it
is
said
that
he
was
changed
and
made
over
in
a
single
night
and
this
is
the
way
it
happened
lars
larsson
went
out
for
a
stroll
late
one
saturday
night
with
his
fiddle
under
his
arm
he
was
excessively
gay
and
jovial
for
he
had
just
come
from
a
party
where
his
playing
had
tempted
both
young
and
old
to
dance
he
walked
along
thinking
that
while
his
bow
was
in
motion
no
one
had
been
able
to
sit
still
there
had
been
such
a
whirl
in
the
cabin
that
once
or
twice
he
fancied
the
chairs
and
tables
were
dancing
too
i
verily
believe
they
have
never
before
had
a
musician
like
me
in
these
parts
he
remarked
to
himself
but
i
had
a
mighty
rough
time
of
it
before
i
became
such
a
clever
chap
he
continued
when
i
was
a
child
it
was
no
fun
for
me
when
my
parents
put
me
to
tending
cows
and
sheep
and
when
i
forgot
everything
else
to
sit
and
twang
my
fiddle
and
just
fancy
they
would
so
much
as
give
me
a
real
violin
i
had
nothing
to
play
on
but
an
old
wooden
box
over
which
i
had
stretched
some
strings
in
the
daytime
when
i
could
be
alone
in
the
woods
i
fared
rather
well
but
it
was
none
too
cheerful
to
come
home
in
the
evening
when
the
cattle
had
strayed
from
me
then
i
heard
often
enough
from
both
father
and
mother
that
i
was
a
and
never
would
amount
to
anything
in
that
part
of
the
forest
where
lars
larsson
was
strolling
a
little
river
was
trying
to
find
its
way
the
ground
was
stony
and
hilly
and
the
stream
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
ahead
winding
this
way
and
that
way
rolling
over
little
falls
and
rapids
and
yet
it
appeared
to
get
nowhere
the
path
where
the
fiddler
walked
on
the
other
hand
tried
to
go
as
straight
ahead
as
possible
therefore
it
was
continually
meeting
the
sinuous
stream
and
each
time
it
would
dart
across
it
by
using
a
little
bridge
the
musician
also
had
to
cross
the
stream
repeatedly
and
he
was
glad
of
it
he
thought
it
was
as
though
he
had
found
company
in
the
forest
where
he
was
tramping
it
was
light
the
sun
had
not
yet
come
up
but
its
being
away
made
no
difference
for
it
was
as
light
as
day
all
the
same
still
the
light
was
not
quite
what
it
is
in
the
daytime
everything
had
a
different
color
the
sky
was
perfectly
white
the
trees
and
the
growths
on
the
ground
were
grayish
but
everything
was
as
distinctly
visible
as
in
the
daytime
and
when
lars
larsson
paused
on
any
of
the
numerous
bridges
and
looked
down
into
the
stream
he
could
distinguish
every
ripple
on
the
water
when
i
see
a
stream
like
this
in
the
wilderness
he
thought
i
am
reminded
of
my
own
life
as
persistent
as
this
stream
have
i
been
in
forcing
my
way
past
all
that
has
obstructed
my
path
father
has
been
my
rock
ahead
and
mother
tried
to
hold
me
back
and
bury
me
between
but
i
stole
past
both
of
them
and
got
out
in
the
world
hi
hi
i
think
mother
is
still
sitting
at
home
and
weeping
for
me
but
what
do
i
care
she
might
have
known
that
i
should
amount
to
something
some
day
instead
of
trying
to
oppose
me
impatiently
he
tore
some
leaves
from
a
branch
and
threw
them
into
the
river
look
thus
have
i
torn
myself
loose
from
everything
at
home
he
said
as
he
watched
the
leaves
borne
away
by
the
water
i
am
just
wondering
if
mother
knows
that
i
the
best
musician
in
vermland
he
remarked
as
he
went
farther
he
walked
on
rapidly
until
he
came
across
the
stream
again
then
he
stopped
and
looked
into
the
water
here
the
river
went
along
in
a
struggling
rapid
creating
a
terrible
racket
as
it
was
night
one
heard
from
the
stream
sounds
quite
different
from
those
of
the
daytime
and
the
musician
was
perfectly
astonished
when
he
stood
still
and
listened
there
was
no
bird
song
in
the
trees
and
no
music
in
the
pines
and
no
rustling
in
the
leaves
no
wagon
wheels
creaked
in
the
road
and
no
tinkled
in
the
wood
one
heard
only
the
rapid
but
because
all
the
other
things
were
hushed
it
could
be
heard
so
much
better
than
during
the
day
it
sounded
as
though
everything
thinkable
and
unthinkable
was
rioting
and
clamoring
in
the
depths
of
the
stream
first
it
sounded
as
if
some
one
were
sitting
down
there
and
grinding
grain
between
stones
and
then
it
sounded
as
though
goblets
were
clinking
in
a
and
again
there
was
a
murmuring
as
when
the
congregation
had
left
the
church
and
were
standing
on
the
church
knoll
after
the
service
talking
earnestly
together
i
suppose
this
too
is
a
kind
of
music
thought
the
fiddler
although
i
ca
find
anything
much
in
it
i
think
the
air
that
i
composed
the
other
day
was
much
more
worth
listening
to
but
the
longer
lars
larsson
listened
to
the
music
of
the
rapid
the
better
he
thought
it
sounded
i
believe
you
are
improving
he
said
to
the
rapid
it
must
have
dawned
upon
you
that
the
best
musician
in
vermland
is
listening
to
you
the
instant
he
had
made
this
remark
he
fancied
he
heard
a
couple
of
clear
metallic
sounds
as
when
some
one
picks
a
violin
string
to
hear
if
it
is
in
tune
but
see
hark
the
himself
has
arrived
i
can
hear
how
he
begins
to
thrum
on
the
violin
let
us
hear
now
if
you
can
play
better
than
i
said
lars
larsson
laughing
but
i
ca
stand
here
all
night
waiting
for
you
to
begin
he
called
to
the
water
now
i
must
be
going
but
i
promise
you
that
i
will
also
stop
at
the
next
bridge
and
listen
to
hear
if
you
can
cope
with
me
he
went
farther
and
as
the
stream
in
its
winding
course
ran
into
the
wood
he
began
thinking
once
more
of
his
home
i
wonder
how
the
little
brooklet
that
runs
by
our
house
is
getting
on
i
should
like
to
see
it
again
i
ought
to
go
home
once
in
a
while
to
see
if
mother
is
suffering
want
and
hardship
since
father
death
but
busy
as
i
am
it
is
almost
impossible
as
busy
as
i
am
just
now
i
say
i
ca
look
after
anything
but
the
fiddle
there
is
hardly
an
evening
in
the
week
that
i
am
at
liberty
in
a
little
while
he
met
the
stream
again
and
his
thoughts
were
turned
to
something
else
at
this
crossing
the
river
did
not
come
rushing
on
in
a
noisy
rapid
but
glided
ahead
rather
quietly
it
lay
perfectly
black
and
shiny
under
the
forest
trees
and
carried
with
it
one
and
another
patch
of
scum
from
the
rapids
above
when
the
musician
came
down
upon
the
bridge
and
heard
no
sound
from
the
stream
but
a
soft
swish
now
and
then
he
began
to
laugh
i
might
have
known
that
the
would
care
to
come
to
the
meeting
he
shouted
to
be
sure
i
have
always
heard
that
he
is
considered
an
excellent
performer
but
one
who
lies
still
forever
in
a
brook
and
never
hears
anything
new
ca
know
very
much
he
perceives
no
doubt
that
here
stands
one
who
knows
more
about
music
than
he
therefore
he
does
care
to
let
me
hear
him
then
he
went
farther
and
lost
sight
of
the
river
again
he
came
into
a
part
of
the
forest
which
he
had
always
thought
dismal
and
bleak
to
wander
through
there
the
ground
was
covered
with
big
stone
heaps
and
gnarled
pine
stumps
lay
uprooted
among
them
if
there
was
anything
magical
or
fearsome
in
the
forest
one
would
naturally
think
that
it
concealed
itself
here
when
the
musician
came
in
among
the
wild
stone
blocks
a
shudder
passed
through
him
and
he
began
to
wonder
if
it
had
not
been
unwise
of
him
to
boast
in
the
presence
of
the
he
fancied
the
large
pine
roots
began
to
gesticulate
as
if
they
were
threatening
him
beware
you
who
think
yourself
cleverer
than
the
it
seemed
as
if
they
wanted
to
say
lars
larsson
felt
how
his
heart
contracted
with
dread
a
heavy
weight
bore
down
upon
his
chest
so
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
and
his
hands
became
then
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
and
tried
to
talk
sense
to
himself
why
there
no
musician
in
the
waterfall
said
he
such
things
are
only
superstition
and
nonsense
it
of
no
consequence
what
i
have
said
or
have
said
to
him
as
he
spoke
he
looked
around
him
as
if
for
some
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
what
he
said
had
it
been
daytime
every
tiny
leaf
would
have
winked
at
him
that
there
was
nothing
dangerous
in
the
wood
but
now
at
night
the
leaves
on
the
trees
were
closed
and
silent
and
looked
as
though
they
were
hiding
all
sorts
of
dangerous
secrets
lars
larsson
grew
more
and
more
alarmed
that
which
caused
him
the
greatest
fear
was
having
to
cross
the
stream
once
more
before
it
and
the
road
parted
company
and
went
in
different
directions
he
wondered
what
the
would
do
to
him
when
he
walked
across
the
last
bridge
if
he
might
perhaps
stretch
a
big
black
hand
out
of
the
water
and
drag
him
down
into
the
depths
he
had
worked
himself
into
such
a
state
of
fright
that
he
thought
of
turning
back
but
then
he
would
meet
the
stream
again
and
if
he
were
to
turn
out
of
the
road
and
go
into
the
wood
he
would
also
meet
it
the
way
it
kept
bending
and
winding
itself
he
felt
so
nervous
that
he
did
know
what
to
do
he
was
snared
and
captured
and
bound
by
that
stream
and
saw
no
possibility
of
escape
finally
he
saw
before
him
the
last
bridge
crossing
directly
opposite
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
stood
an
old
mill
which
must
have
been
abandoned
these
many
years
the
big
hung
motionless
over
the
water
the
lay
mouldering
on
the
land
the
was
and
its
sides
were
lined
with
common
fern
and
if
all
had
been
as
formerly
and
there
were
people
here
thought
the
musician
i
should
be
safe
now
from
all
danger
but
at
all
events
he
felt
reassured
in
seeing
a
building
constructed
by
human
hands
and
as
he
crossed
the
stream
he
was
scarcely
frightened
at
all
nor
did
anything
dreadful
happen
to
him
the
seemed
to
have
no
quarrel
with
him
he
was
simply
amazed
to
think
he
had
worked
himself
into
a
panic
over
nothing
whatever
he
felt
very
happy
and
secure
and
became
even
happier
when
the
mill
door
opened
and
a
young
girl
came
out
to
him
she
looked
like
an
ordinary
peasant
girl
she
had
a
cotton
kerchief
on
her
head
and
wore
a
short
skirt
and
full
jacket
but
her
feet
were
bare
she
walked
up
to
the
musician
and
said
to
him
without
further
ceremony
if
you
will
play
for
me
i
dance
for
you
why
certainly
said
the
fiddler
who
was
in
fine
spirits
now
that
he
was
rid
of
his
fear
that
i
can
do
of
course
i
have
never
in
my
life
refused
to
play
for
a
pretty
girl
who
wants
to
dance
he
took
his
place
on
a
stone
near
the
edge
of
the
raised
the
violin
to
his
chin
and
began
to
play
the
girl
took
a
few
steps
in
rhythm
with
the
music
then
she
stopped
what
kind
of
a
polka
are
you
playing
said
she
there
is
no
vim
in
it
the
fiddler
changed
his
tune
he
tried
one
with
more
life
in
it
the
girl
was
just
as
dissatisfied
i
ca
dance
to
such
a
draggy
polka
said
she
then
lars
larsson
struck
up
the
wildest
air
he
knew
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
this
one
he
said
you
will
have
to
call
hither
a
better
musician
than
i
am
the
instant
he
said
this
he
felt
that
a
hand
caught
his
arm
at
the
elbow
and
began
to
guide
the
bow
and
increase
the
tempo
then
from
the
violin
there
poured
forth
a
strain
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
before
heard
it
moved
in
such
a
quick
tempo
he
thought
that
a
rolling
wheel
could
have
kept
up
with
it
now
that
what
i
call
a
polka
said
the
girl
and
began
to
swing
round
but
the
musician
did
not
glance
at
her
he
was
so
astonished
at
the
air
he
was
playing
that
he
stood
with
closed
eyes
to
hear
better
when
he
opened
them
after
a
moment
the
girl
was
gone
but
he
did
not
wonder
much
at
this
he
continued
to
play
on
long
and
well
only
because
he
had
never
before
heard
such
violin
playing
it
must
be
time
now
to
finish
with
this
he
thought
finally
and
wanted
to
lay
down
the
bow
but
the
bow
kept
up
its
motion
he
make
it
stop
it
travelled
back
and
forth
over
the
strings
and
jerked
the
hand
and
arm
with
it
and
the
hand
that
held
the
neck
of
the
violin
and
fingered
the
strings
could
not
free
itself
either
the
cold
sweat
stood
out
on
lars
larsson
brow
and
he
was
frightened
now
in
earnest
how
will
this
end
shall
i
sit
here
and
play
till
doomsday
he
asked
himself
in
despair
the
bow
ran
on
and
on
and
magically
called
forth
one
tune
after
another
always
it
was
something
new
and
it
was
so
beautiful
that
the
poor
fiddler
must
have
known
how
little
his
own
skill
was
worth
and
it
was
this
that
tortured
him
worse
than
the
fatigue
he
who
plays
upon
my
violin
understands
the
art
but
never
in
all
my
born
days
have
i
been
anything
but
a
bungler
now
for
the
first
time
learning
how
music
should
sound
for
a
few
seconds
he
became
so
transported
by
the
music
that
he
forgot
his
evil
fate
then
he
felt
how
his
arm
ached
from
weariness
and
he
was
seized
anew
with
despair
this
violin
i
can
not
lay
down
until
i
have
played
myself
to
death
i
can
understand
that
the
wo
be
satisfied
with
less
he
began
to
weep
over
himself
but
all
the
while
he
kept
on
playing
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
had
i
stayed
at
home
in
the
little
cabin
with
mother
what
is
all
the
glory
worth
if
it
is
to
end
in
this
way
he
sat
there
hour
after
hour
morning
came
on
the
sun
rose
and
the
birds
sang
all
around
him
but
he
played
and
he
played
without
intermission
as
it
was
a
sunday
that
dawned
he
had
to
sit
there
by
the
old
mill
all
alone
no
human
beings
tramped
in
this
part
of
the
forest
they
went
to
church
down
in
the
dale
and
to
the
villages
along
the
big
highway
forenoon
came
along
and
the
sun
stepped
higher
and
higher
in
the
sky
the
birds
grew
silent
and
the
wind
began
to
murmur
in
the
long
pine
needles
lars
larsson
did
not
let
the
summer
day
heat
deter
him
he
played
and
played
at
last
evening
was
ushered
in
the
sun
sank
but
his
bow
needed
no
rest
and
his
arm
continued
to
move
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
this
will
be
the
death
of
me
said
he
and
it
is
a
righteous
punishment
for
all
my
conceit
far
along
in
the
evening
a
human
being
came
wandering
through
the
wood
it
was
a
poor
old
woman
with
bent
back
and
white
hair
and
a
countenance
that
was
furrowed
by
many
sorrows
it
seems
strange
thought
the
player
but
i
think
i
recognize
that
old
woman
can
it
be
possible
that
it
is
my
mother
can
it
be
possible
that
mother
has
grown
so
old
and
gray
he
called
aloud
and
stopped
her
mother
mother
come
here
to
me
he
cried
she
paused
as
if
unwillingly
i
hear
now
with
my
own
ears
that
you
are
the
best
musician
in
vermland
said
she
i
can
well
understand
that
you
do
not
care
any
more
for
a
poor
old
woman
like
me
mother
mother
do
pass
me
by
cried
lars
larsson
i
no
great
performer
only
a
poor
wretch
come
here
that
i
may
speak
with
you
then
the
mother
came
nearer
and
saw
how
he
sat
and
played
his
face
was
as
pale
as
death
his
hair
dripped
sweat
and
blood
oozed
out
from
under
the
roots
of
his
nails
mother
i
have
fallen
into
misfortune
because
of
my
vanity
and
now
i
must
play
myself
to
death
but
tell
me
before
this
happens
if
you
can
forgive
me
who
left
you
alone
and
poor
in
your
old
age
his
mother
was
seized
with
a
great
compassion
for
the
son
and
all
the
anger
she
had
felt
toward
him
was
as
if
blown
away
why
surely
i
forgive
you
said
she
and
as
she
saw
his
anguish
and
bewilderment
and
wanted
him
to
understand
that
she
meant
what
she
said
she
repeated
it
in
the
name
of
god
in
the
name
of
god
our
redeemer
i
forgive
you
and
when
she
said
this
the
bow
stopped
the
violin
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
musician
arose
saved
and
redeemed
for
the
enchantment
was
broken
because
his
old
mother
had
felt
such
compassion
for
his
distress
that
she
had
spoken
god
name
over
him
the
legend
of
the
christmas
rose
robber
mother
who
lived
in
robbers
cave
up
in
göinge
forest
went
down
to
the
village
one
day
on
a
begging
tour
robber
father
who
was
an
outlawed
man
did
not
dare
to
leave
the
forest
but
had
to
content
himself
with
lying
in
wait
for
the
wayfarers
who
ventured
within
its
borders
but
at
that
time
travellers
were
not
very
plentiful
in
southern
skåne
if
it
so
happened
that
the
man
had
had
a
few
weeks
of
ill
luck
with
his
hunt
his
wife
would
take
to
the
road
she
took
with
her
five
youngsters
and
each
youngster
wore
a
ragged
leathern
suit
and
shoes
and
bore
a
sack
on
his
back
as
long
as
himself
when
robber
mother
stepped
inside
the
door
of
a
cabin
no
one
dared
refuse
to
give
her
whatever
she
demanded
for
she
was
not
above
coming
back
the
following
night
and
setting
fire
to
the
house
if
she
had
not
been
well
received
robber
mother
and
her
brood
were
worse
than
a
pack
of
wolves
and
many
a
man
felt
like
running
a
spear
through
them
but
it
was
never
done
because
they
all
knew
that
the
man
stayed
up
in
the
forest
and
he
would
have
known
how
to
wreak
vengeance
if
anything
had
happened
to
the
children
or
the
old
woman
now
that
robber
mother
went
from
house
to
house
and
begged
she
came
one
day
to
övid
which
at
that
time
was
a
cloister
she
rang
the
bell
of
the
cloister
gate
and
asked
for
food
the
watchman
let
down
a
small
wicket
in
the
gate
and
handed
her
six
round
bread
cakes
one
for
herself
and
one
for
each
of
the
five
children
while
the
mother
was
standing
quietly
at
the
gate
her
youngsters
were
running
about
and
now
one
of
them
came
and
pulled
at
her
skirt
as
a
signal
that
he
had
discovered
something
which
she
ought
to
come
and
see
and
robber
mother
followed
him
promptly
the
entire
cloister
was
surrounded
by
a
high
and
strong
wall
but
the
youngster
had
managed
to
find
a
little
back
gate
which
stood
ajar
when
robber
mother
got
there
she
pushed
the
gate
open
and
walked
inside
without
asking
leave
as
it
was
her
custom
to
do
övid
cloister
was
managed
at
that
time
by
abbot
hans
who
knew
all
about
herbs
just
within
the
cloister
wall
he
had
planted
a
little
herb
garden
and
it
was
into
this
that
the
old
woman
had
forced
her
way
at
first
glance
robber
mother
was
so
astonished
that
she
paused
at
the
gate
it
was
high
summertide
and
abbot
hans
garden
was
so
full
of
flowers
that
the
eyes
were
fairly
dazzled
by
the
blues
reds
and
yellows
as
one
looked
into
it
but
presently
an
indulgent
smile
spread
over
her
features
and
she
started
to
walk
up
a
narrow
path
that
lay
between
many
in
the
garden
a
lay
brother
walked
about
pulling
up
weeds
it
was
he
who
had
left
the
door
in
the
wall
open
that
he
might
throw
the
weeds
and
tares
on
the
rubbish
heap
outside
when
he
saw
robber
mother
coming
in
with
all
five
youngsters
in
tow
he
ran
toward
her
at
once
and
ordered
them
away
but
the
beggar
woman
walked
right
on
as
before
she
cast
her
eyes
up
and
down
looking
now
at
the
stiff
white
lilies
which
spread
near
the
ground
then
on
the
ivy
climbing
high
upon
the
cloister
wall
and
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
lay
brother
he
thought
she
had
not
understood
him
and
wanted
to
take
her
by
the
arm
and
turn
her
toward
the
gate
but
when
the
robber
woman
saw
his
purpose
she
gave
him
a
look
that
sent
him
reeling
backward
she
had
been
walking
with
back
bent
under
her
beggar
pack
but
now
she
straightened
herself
to
her
full
height
i
am
robber
mother
from
göinge
forest
so
touch
me
if
you
dare
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
as
certain
she
would
be
left
in
peace
as
if
she
had
announced
that
she
was
the
queen
of
denmark
and
yet
the
lay
brother
dared
to
oppose
her
although
now
when
he
knew
who
she
was
he
spoke
reasonably
to
her
you
must
know
robber
mother
that
this
is
a
monks
cloister
and
no
woman
in
the
land
is
allowed
within
these
walls
if
you
do
not
go
away
the
monks
will
be
angry
with
me
because
i
forgot
to
close
the
gate
and
perhaps
they
will
drive
me
away
from
the
cloister
and
the
herb
garden
but
such
prayers
were
wasted
on
robber
mother
she
walked
straight
ahead
among
the
little
and
looked
at
the
hyssop
with
its
magenta
blossoms
and
at
the
honeysuckles
which
were
full
of
deep
flower
clusters
then
the
lay
brother
knew
of
no
other
remedy
than
to
run
into
the
cloister
and
call
for
help
he
returned
with
two
stalwart
monks
and
robber
mother
saw
that
now
it
meant
business
with
feet
firmly
planted
she
stood
in
the
path
and
began
shrieking
in
strident
tones
all
the
awful
vengeance
she
would
wreak
on
the
cloister
if
she
could
remain
in
the
herb
garden
as
long
as
she
wished
but
the
monks
did
not
see
why
they
need
fear
her
and
thought
only
of
driving
her
out
then
robber
mother
let
out
a
perfect
volley
of
shrieks
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
monks
clawed
and
bit
at
them
so
did
all
the
youngsters
the
men
soon
learned
that
she
could
overpower
them
and
all
they
could
do
was
to
go
back
into
the
cloister
for
reinforcements
as
they
ran
through
the
which
led
to
the
cloister
they
met
abbot
hans
who
came
rushing
out
to
learn
what
all
this
noise
was
about
then
they
had
to
confess
that
robber
mother
from
göinge
forest
had
come
into
the
cloister
and
that
they
were
unable
to
drive
her
out
and
must
call
for
assistance
but
abbot
hans
upbraided
them
for
using
force
and
forbade
their
calling
for
help
he
sent
both
monks
back
to
their
work
and
although
he
was
an
old
and
fragile
man
he
took
with
him
only
the
lay
brother
when
abbot
hans
came
out
in
the
garden
robber
mother
was
still
wandering
among
the
he
regarded
her
with
astonishment
he
was
certain
that
robber
mother
had
never
before
seen
an
herb
garden
yet
she
sauntered
leisurely
between
all
the
small
patches
each
of
which
had
been
planted
with
its
own
species
of
rare
flower
and
looked
at
them
as
if
they
were
old
acquaintances
at
some
she
smiled
at
others
she
shook
her
head
abbot
hans
loved
his
herb
garden
as
much
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
love
anything
earthly
and
perishable
wild
and
terrible
as
the
old
woman
looked
he
could
help
liking
that
she
had
fought
with
three
monks
for
the
privilege
of
viewing
the
garden
in
peace
he
came
up
to
her
and
asked
in
a
mild
tone
if
the
garden
pleased
her
robber
mother
turned
defiantly
toward
abbot
hans
for
she
expected
only
to
be
trapped
and
overpowered
but
when
she
noticed
his
white
hair
and
bent
form
she
answered
peaceably
first
when
i
saw
this
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
a
prettier
garden
but
now
i
see
that
it
ca
be
compared
with
one
i
know
of
abbot
hans
had
certainly
expected
a
different
answer
when
he
heard
that
robber
mother
had
seen
a
garden
more
beautiful
than
his
a
faint
flush
spread
over
his
withered
cheek
the
lay
brother
who
was
standing
close
by
immediately
began
to
censure
the
old
woman
this
is
abbot
hans
said
he
who
with
much
care
and
diligence
has
gathered
the
flowers
from
far
and
near
for
his
herb
garden
we
all
know
that
there
is
not
a
more
beautiful
garden
to
be
found
in
all
skåne
and
it
is
not
befitting
that
you
who
live
in
the
wild
forest
all
the
year
around
should
find
fault
with
his
work
i
do
wish
to
make
myself
the
judge
of
either
him
or
you
said
robber
mother
i
only
saying
that
if
you
could
see
the
garden
of
which
i
am
thinking
you
would
uproot
all
the
flowers
planted
here
and
cast
them
away
like
weeds
but
the
abbot
assistant
was
hardly
less
proud
of
the
flowers
than
the
abbot
himself
and
after
hearing
her
remarks
he
laughed
derisively
i
can
understand
that
you
only
talk
like
this
to
tease
us
it
must
be
a
pretty
garden
that
you
have
made
for
yourself
amongst
the
pines
in
göinge
forest
i
be
willing
to
wager
my
soul
salvation
that
you
have
never
before
been
within
the
walls
of
an
herb
garden
robber
mother
grew
crimson
with
rage
to
think
that
her
word
was
doubted
and
she
cried
out
it
may
be
true
that
until
i
had
never
been
within
the
walls
of
an
herb
garden
but
you
monks
who
are
holy
men
certainly
must
know
that
on
every
christmas
eve
the
great
göinge
forest
is
transformed
into
a
beautiful
garden
to
commemorate
the
hour
of
our
lord
birth
we
who
live
in
the
forest
have
seen
this
happen
every
year
and
in
that
garden
i
have
seen
flowers
so
lovely
that
i
dared
not
lift
my
hand
to
pluck
them
the
lay
brother
wanted
to
continue
the
argument
but
abbot
hans
gave
him
a
sign
to
be
silent
for
ever
since
his
childhood
abbot
hans
had
heard
it
said
that
on
every
christmas
eve
the
forest
was
dressed
in
holiday
glory
he
had
often
longed
to
see
it
but
he
had
never
had
the
good
fortune
eagerly
he
begged
and
implored
robber
mother
that
he
might
come
up
to
the
robbers
cave
on
christmas
eve
if
she
would
only
send
one
of
her
children
to
show
him
the
way
he
could
ride
up
there
alone
and
he
would
never
betray
them
on
the
contrary
he
would
reward
them
in
so
far
as
it
lay
in
his
power
robber
mother
said
no
at
first
for
she
was
thinking
of
robber
father
and
of
the
peril
which
might
befall
him
should
she
permit
abbot
hans
to
ride
up
to
their
cave
at
the
same
time
the
desire
to
prove
to
the
monk
that
the
garden
which
she
knew
was
more
beautiful
than
his
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
gave
in
but
more
than
one
follower
you
can
not
take
with
you
said
she
and
you
are
not
to
waylay
us
or
trap
us
as
sure
as
you
are
a
holy
man
this
abbot
hans
promised
and
then
robber
mother
went
her
way
abbot
hans
commanded
the
lay
brother
not
to
reveal
to
a
soul
that
which
had
been
agreed
upon
he
feared
that
the
monks
should
they
learn
of
his
purpose
would
not
allow
a
man
of
his
years
to
go
up
to
the
cave
nor
did
he
himself
intend
to
reveal
his
project
to
a
human
being
and
then
it
happened
that
archbishop
absalon
from
lund
came
to
övid
and
remained
through
the
night
when
abbot
hans
was
showing
him
the
herb
garden
he
got
to
thinking
of
robber
mother
visit
and
the
lay
brother
who
was
at
work
in
the
garden
heard
abbot
hans
telling
the
bishop
about
robber
father
who
these
many
years
had
lived
as
an
outlaw
in
the
forest
and
asking
him
for
a
letter
of
ransom
for
the
man
that
he
might
lead
an
honest
life
among
respectable
folk
as
things
are
now
said
abbot
hans
his
children
are
growing
up
into
worse
malefactors
than
himself
and
you
will
soon
have
a
whole
gang
of
robbers
to
deal
with
up
there
in
the
forest
but
the
archbishop
replied
that
he
did
not
care
to
let
the
robber
loose
among
honest
folk
in
the
villages
it
would
be
best
for
all
that
he
remain
in
the
forest
then
abbot
hans
grew
zealous
and
told
the
bishop
all
about
göinge
forest
which
every
year
at
yuletide
clothed
itself
in
summer
bloom
around
the
robbers
cave
if
these
bandits
are
not
so
bad
but
that
god
glories
can
be
made
manifest
to
them
surely
we
can
not
be
too
wicked
to
experience
the
same
blessing
the
archbishop
knew
how
to
answer
abbot
hans
this
much
i
will
promise
you
abbot
hans
he
said
smiling
that
any
day
you
send
me
a
blossom
from
the
garden
in
göinge
forest
i
will
give
you
letters
of
ransom
for
all
the
outlaws
you
may
choose
to
plead
for
the
lay
brother
apprehended
that
bishop
absalon
believed
as
little
in
this
story
of
robber
mother
as
he
himself
but
abbot
hans
perceived
nothing
of
the
sort
but
thanked
absalon
for
his
good
promise
and
said
that
he
would
surely
send
him
the
flower
abbot
hans
had
his
way
and
the
following
christmas
eve
he
did
not
sit
at
home
with
his
monks
in
övid
cloister
but
was
on
his
way
to
göinge
forest
one
of
robber
mother
wild
youngsters
ran
ahead
of
him
and
close
behind
him
was
the
lay
brother
who
had
talked
with
robber
mother
in
the
herb
garden
abbot
hans
had
been
longing
to
make
this
journey
and
he
was
very
happy
now
that
it
had
come
to
pass
but
it
was
a
different
matter
with
the
lay
brother
who
accompanied
him
abbot
hans
was
very
dear
to
him
and
he
would
not
willingly
have
allowed
another
to
attend
him
and
watch
over
him
but
he
did
believe
that
he
should
see
any
christmas
eve
garden
he
thought
the
whole
thing
a
snare
which
robber
mother
had
with
great
cunning
laid
for
abbot
hans
that
he
might
fall
into
her
clutches
while
abbot
hans
was
riding
toward
the
forest
he
saw
that
everywhere
they
were
preparing
to
celebrate
christmas
in
every
peasant
settlement
fires
were
lighted
in
the
to
warm
it
for
the
afternoon
bathing
great
hunks
of
meat
and
bread
were
being
carried
from
the
larders
into
the
cabins
and
from
the
barns
came
the
men
with
big
sheaves
of
straw
to
be
strewn
over
the
floors
as
he
rode
by
the
little
country
churches
he
observed
that
each
parson
with
his
sexton
was
busily
engaged
in
decorating
his
church
and
when
he
came
to
the
road
which
leads
to
bösjo
cloister
he
observed
that
all
the
poor
of
the
parish
were
coming
with
armfuls
of
bread
and
long
candles
which
they
had
received
at
the
cloister
gate
when
abbot
hans
saw
all
these
christmas
preparations
his
haste
increased
he
was
thinking
of
the
festivities
that
awaited
him
which
were
greater
than
any
the
others
would
be
privileged
to
enjoy
but
the
lay
brother
whined
and
fretted
when
he
saw
how
they
were
preparing
to
celebrate
christmas
in
every
humble
cottage
he
grew
more
and
more
anxious
and
begged
and
implored
abbot
hans
to
turn
back
and
not
to
throw
himself
deliberately
into
the
robber
hands
abbot
hans
went
straight
ahead
paying
no
heed
to
his
lamentations
he
left
the
plain
behind
him
and
came
up
into
desolate
and
wild
forest
regions
here
the
road
was
bad
almost
like
a
stony
and
path
with
neither
bridge
nor
plank
to
help
them
over
brooklet
and
rivulet
the
farther
they
rode
the
colder
it
grew
and
after
a
while
they
came
upon
ground
it
turned
out
to
be
a
long
and
hazardous
ride
through
the
forest
they
climbed
steep
and
slippery
side
paths
crawled
over
swamp
and
marsh
and
pushed
through
windfall
and
bramble
just
as
daylight
was
waning
the
robber
boy
guided
them
across
a
forest
meadow
skirted
by
tall
naked
leaf
trees
and
green
fir
trees
back
of
the
meadow
loomed
a
mountain
wall
and
in
this
wall
they
saw
a
door
of
thick
boards
now
abbot
hans
understood
that
they
had
arrived
and
dismounted
the
child
opened
the
heavy
door
for
him
and
he
looked
into
a
poor
mountain
grotto
with
bare
stone
walls
robber
mother
was
seated
before
a
log
fire
that
burned
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
alongside
the
walls
were
beds
of
virgin
pine
and
moss
and
on
one
of
these
beds
lay
robber
father
asleep
come
in
you
out
there
shouted
robber
mother
without
rising
and
fetch
the
horses
in
with
you
so
they
wo
be
destroyed
by
the
night
cold
abbot
hans
walked
boldly
into
the
cave
and
the
lay
brother
followed
here
were
wretchedness
and
poverty
and
nothing
was
done
to
celebrate
christmas
robber
mother
had
neither
brewed
nor
baked
she
had
neither
washed
nor
scoured
the
youngsters
were
lying
on
the
floor
around
a
kettle
eating
but
no
better
food
was
provided
for
them
than
a
watery
gruel
robber
mother
spoke
in
a
tone
as
haughty
and
dictatorial
as
any
peasant
woman
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
warm
yourself
abbot
hans
said
she
and
if
you
have
food
with
you
eat
for
the
food
which
we
in
the
forest
prepare
you
would
care
to
taste
and
if
you
are
tired
after
the
long
journey
you
can
lie
down
on
one
of
these
beds
to
sleep
you
need
be
afraid
of
oversleeping
for
i
sitting
here
by
the
fire
keeping
watch
i
shall
awaken
you
in
time
to
see
that
which
you
have
come
up
here
to
see
abbot
hans
obeyed
robber
mother
and
brought
forth
his
food
sack
but
he
was
so
fatigued
after
the
journey
he
was
hardly
able
to
eat
and
as
soon
as
he
could
stretch
himself
on
the
bed
he
fell
asleep
the
lay
brother
was
also
assigned
a
bed
to
rest
upon
but
he
did
dare
sleep
as
he
thought
he
had
better
keep
his
eye
on
robber
father
to
prevent
his
getting
up
and
capturing
abbot
hans
but
gradually
fatigue
got
the
better
of
him
too
and
he
dropped
into
a
doze
when
he
woke
up
he
saw
that
abbot
hans
had
left
his
bed
and
was
sitting
by
the
fire
talking
with
robber
mother
the
outlawed
robber
sat
also
by
the
fire
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
dull
sluggish
appearance
his
back
was
turned
to
abbot
hans
as
though
he
would
have
it
appear
that
he
was
not
listening
to
the
conversation
abbot
hans
was
telling
robber
mother
all
about
the
christmas
preparations
he
had
seen
on
the
journey
reminding
her
of
christmas
feasts
and
games
which
she
must
have
known
in
her
youth
when
she
lived
at
peace
with
mankind
i
sorry
for
your
children
who
can
never
run
on
the
village
street
in
holiday
dress
or
tumble
in
the
christmas
straw
said
he
at
first
robber
mother
answered
in
short
gruff
sentences
but
by
degrees
she
became
more
subdued
and
listened
more
intently
suddenly
robber
father
turned
toward
abbot
hans
and
shook
his
clenched
fist
in
his
face
you
miserable
monk
did
you
come
here
to
coax
from
me
my
wife
and
children
do
you
know
that
i
am
an
outlaw
and
may
not
leave
the
forest
abbot
hans
looked
him
fearlessly
in
the
eyes
it
is
my
purpose
to
get
a
letter
of
ransom
for
you
from
archbishop
absalon
said
he
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
the
robber
and
his
wife
burst
out
laughing
they
knew
well
enough
the
kind
of
mercy
a
forest
robber
could
expect
from
bishop
absalon
oh
if
i
get
a
letter
of
ransom
from
absalon
said
robber
father
then
i
promise
you
that
never
again
will
i
steal
so
much
as
a
goose
the
lay
brother
was
annoyed
with
the
robber
folk
for
daring
to
laugh
at
abbot
hans
but
on
his
own
account
he
was
well
pleased
he
had
seldom
seen
the
abbot
sitting
more
peaceful
and
meek
with
his
monks
at
övid
than
he
now
sat
with
this
wild
robber
folk
suddenly
robber
mother
rose
you
sit
here
and
talk
abbot
hans
she
said
so
that
we
are
forgetting
to
look
at
the
forest
now
i
can
hear
even
in
this
cave
how
the
christmas
bells
are
ringing
the
words
were
barely
uttered
when
they
all
sprang
up
and
rushed
out
but
in
the
forest
it
was
still
dark
night
and
bleak
winter
the
only
thing
they
marked
was
a
distant
clang
borne
on
a
light
south
wind
how
can
this
bell
ringing
ever
awaken
the
dead
forest
thought
abbot
hans
for
now
as
he
stood
out
in
the
winter
darkness
he
thought
it
far
more
impossible
that
a
summer
garden
could
spring
up
here
than
it
had
seemed
to
him
before
when
the
bells
had
been
ringing
a
few
moments
a
sudden
illumination
penetrated
the
forest
the
next
moment
it
was
dark
again
and
then
the
light
came
back
it
pushed
its
way
forward
between
the
stark
trees
like
a
shimmering
mist
this
much
it
effected
the
darkness
merged
into
a
faint
daybreak
then
abbot
hans
saw
that
the
snow
had
vanished
from
the
ground
as
if
some
one
had
removed
a
carpet
and
the
earth
began
to
take
on
a
green
covering
then
the
ferns
shot
up
their
fronds
rolled
like
a
bishop
staff
the
heather
that
grew
on
the
stony
hills
and
the
rooted
in
the
ground
moss
dressed
themselves
quickly
in
new
bloom
the
thickened
and
raised
themselves
and
the
spring
blossoms
shot
upward
their
swelling
buds
which
already
had
a
touch
of
color
abbot
hans
heart
beat
fast
as
he
marked
the
first
signs
of
the
awakening
old
man
that
i
am
shall
i
behold
such
a
miracle
thought
he
and
the
tears
wanted
to
spring
to
his
eyes
again
it
grew
so
hazy
that
he
feared
the
darkness
would
once
more
cover
the
earth
but
almost
immediately
there
came
a
new
wave
of
light
it
brought
with
it
the
splash
of
rivulet
and
the
rush
of
cataract
then
the
leaves
of
the
trees
burst
into
bloom
as
if
a
swarm
of
green
butterflies
came
flying
and
clustered
on
the
branches
it
was
not
only
trees
and
plants
that
awoke
but
crossbeaks
hopped
from
branch
to
branch
and
the
woodpeckers
hammered
on
the
limbs
until
the
splinters
fairly
flew
around
them
a
flock
of
starlings
from
up
country
lighted
in
a
fir
top
to
rest
they
were
paradise
starlings
the
tips
of
each
tiny
feather
shone
in
brilliant
reds
and
as
the
birds
moved
they
glittered
like
so
many
jewels
again
all
was
dark
for
an
instant
but
soon
there
came
a
new
light
wave
a
fresh
warm
south
wind
blew
and
scattered
over
the
forest
meadow
all
the
little
seeds
that
had
been
brought
here
from
southern
lands
by
birds
and
ships
and
winds
and
which
could
not
thrive
elsewhere
because
of
this
country
cruel
cold
these
took
root
and
sprang
up
the
instant
they
touched
the
ground
when
the
next
warm
wind
came
along
the
blueberries
and
lignon
ripened
cranes
and
wild
geese
shrieked
in
the
air
the
bullfinches
built
nests
and
the
baby
squirrels
began
playing
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
everything
came
so
fast
now
that
abbot
hans
could
not
stop
to
reflect
on
how
immeasurably
great
was
the
miracle
that
was
taking
place
he
had
time
only
to
use
his
eyes
and
ears
the
next
light
wave
that
came
rushing
in
brought
with
it
the
scent
of
newly
ploughed
acres
and
far
off
in
the
distance
the
milkmaids
were
heard
coaxing
the
cows
and
the
tinkle
of
the
sheep
bells
pine
and
spruce
trees
were
so
thickly
clothed
with
red
cones
that
they
shone
like
crimson
mantles
the
juniper
berries
changed
color
every
second
and
forest
flowers
covered
the
ground
till
it
was
all
red
blue
and
yellow
abbot
hans
bent
down
to
the
earth
and
broke
off
a
wild
strawberry
blossom
and
as
he
straightened
up
the
berry
ripened
in
his
hand
the
mother
fox
came
out
of
her
lair
with
a
big
litter
of
young
she
went
up
to
robber
mother
and
scratched
at
her
skirt
and
robber
mother
bent
down
to
her
and
praised
her
young
the
horned
owl
who
had
just
begun
his
night
chase
was
astonished
at
the
light
and
went
back
to
his
ravine
to
perch
for
the
night
the
male
cuckoo
crowed
and
his
mate
stole
up
to
the
nests
of
the
little
birds
with
her
egg
in
her
mouth
robber
mother
youngsters
let
out
perfect
shrieks
of
delight
they
stuffed
themselves
with
wild
strawberries
that
hung
on
the
bushes
large
as
pine
cones
one
of
them
played
with
a
litter
of
young
hares
another
ran
a
race
with
some
young
crows
which
had
hopped
from
their
nest
before
they
were
really
ready
a
third
caught
up
an
adder
from
the
ground
and
wound
it
around
his
neck
and
arm
robber
father
was
standing
out
on
a
marsh
eating
raspberries
when
he
glanced
up
a
big
black
bear
stood
beside
him
robber
father
broke
off
an
osier
twig
and
struck
the
bear
on
the
nose
keep
to
your
own
ground
you
he
said
this
is
my
turf
then
the
huge
bear
turned
around
and
lumbered
off
in
another
direction
new
waves
of
warmth
and
light
kept
coming
and
now
they
brought
with
them
seeds
from
the
golden
pollen
from
rye
fields
fairly
flew
in
the
air
then
came
butterflies
so
big
that
they
looked
like
flying
lilies
the
in
a
hollow
oak
was
already
so
full
of
honey
that
it
dripped
down
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
then
all
the
flowers
whose
seeds
had
been
brought
from
foreign
lands
began
to
blossom
the
loveliest
roses
climbed
up
the
mountain
wall
in
a
race
with
the
blackberry
vines
and
from
the
forest
meadow
sprang
flowers
as
large
as
human
faces
abbot
hans
thought
of
the
flower
he
was
to
pluck
for
bishop
absalon
but
each
new
flower
that
appeared
was
more
beautiful
than
the
others
and
he
wanted
to
choose
the
most
beautiful
of
all
wave
upon
wave
kept
coming
until
the
air
was
so
filled
with
light
that
it
glittered
all
the
life
and
beauty
and
joy
of
summer
smiled
on
abbot
hans
he
felt
that
earth
could
bring
no
greater
happiness
than
that
which
welled
up
about
him
and
he
said
to
himself
i
do
not
know
what
new
beauties
the
next
wave
that
comes
can
bring
with
it
but
the
light
kept
streaming
in
and
now
it
seemed
to
abbot
hans
that
it
carried
with
it
something
from
an
infinite
distance
he
felt
a
celestial
atmosphere
enfolding
him
and
tremblingly
he
began
to
anticipate
now
that
earth
joys
had
come
the
glories
of
heaven
were
approaching
then
abbot
hans
marked
how
all
grew
still
the
birds
hushed
their
songs
the
flowers
ceased
growing
and
the
young
foxes
played
no
more
the
glory
now
nearing
was
such
that
the
heart
wanted
to
stop
beating
the
eyes
wept
without
one
knowing
it
the
soul
longed
to
soar
away
into
the
eternal
from
far
in
the
distance
faint
harp
tones
were
heard
and
celestial
song
like
a
soft
murmur
reached
him
abbot
hans
clasped
his
hands
and
dropped
to
his
knees
his
face
was
radiant
with
bliss
never
had
he
dreamed
that
even
in
this
life
it
should
be
granted
him
to
taste
the
joys
of
heaven
and
to
hear
angels
sing
christmas
carols
but
beside
abbot
hans
stood
the
lay
brother
who
had
accompanied
him
in
his
mind
there
were
dark
thoughts
this
can
not
be
a
true
miracle
he
thought
since
it
is
revealed
to
malefactors
this
does
not
come
from
god
but
has
its
origin
in
witchcraft
and
is
sent
hither
by
satan
it
is
the
evil
one
power
that
is
tempting
us
and
compelling
us
to
see
that
which
has
no
real
existence
from
afar
were
heard
the
sound
of
angel
harps
and
the
tones
of
a
miserere
but
the
lay
brother
thought
it
was
the
evil
spirits
of
hell
coming
closer
they
would
enchant
and
seduce
us
sighed
he
and
we
shall
be
sold
into
perdition
the
angel
throng
was
so
near
now
that
abbot
hans
saw
their
bright
forms
through
the
forest
branches
the
lay
brother
saw
them
too
but
back
of
all
this
wondrous
beauty
he
saw
only
some
dread
evil
for
him
it
was
the
devil
who
performed
these
wonders
on
the
anniversary
of
our
birth
it
was
done
simply
for
the
purpose
of
more
effectually
deluding
poor
human
beings
all
the
while
the
birds
had
been
circling
around
the
head
of
abbot
hans
and
they
let
him
take
them
in
his
hands
but
all
the
animals
were
afraid
of
the
lay
brother
no
bird
perched
on
his
shoulder
no
snake
played
at
his
feet
then
there
came
a
little
forest
dove
when
she
marked
that
the
angels
were
nearing
she
plucked
up
courage
and
flew
down
on
the
lay
brother
shoulder
and
laid
her
head
against
his
cheek
then
it
appeared
to
him
as
if
sorcery
were
come
right
upon
him
to
tempt
and
corrupt
him
he
struck
with
his
hand
at
the
forest
dove
and
cried
in
such
a
loud
voice
that
it
rang
throughout
the
forest
go
thou
back
to
hell
whence
thou
art
come
just
then
the
angels
were
so
near
that
abbot
hans
felt
the
feathery
touch
of
their
great
wings
and
he
bowed
down
to
earth
in
reverent
greeting
but
when
the
lay
brother
words
sounded
their
song
was
hushed
and
the
holy
guests
turned
in
flight
at
the
same
time
the
light
and
the
mild
warmth
vanished
in
unspeakable
terror
for
the
darkness
and
cold
in
a
human
heart
darkness
sank
over
the
earth
like
a
coverlet
frost
came
all
the
growths
shrivelled
up
the
animals
and
birds
hastened
away
the
rushing
of
streams
was
hushed
the
leaves
dropped
from
the
trees
rustling
like
rain
abbot
hans
felt
how
his
heart
which
had
but
lately
swelled
with
bliss
was
now
contracting
with
insufferable
agony
i
can
never
outlive
this
thought
he
that
the
angels
from
heaven
had
been
so
close
to
me
and
were
driven
away
that
they
wanted
to
sing
christmas
carols
for
me
and
were
driven
to
flight
then
he
remembered
the
flower
he
had
promised
bishop
absalon
and
at
the
last
moment
he
fumbled
among
the
leaves
and
moss
to
try
and
find
a
blossom
but
he
sensed
how
the
ground
under
his
fingers
froze
and
how
the
white
snow
came
gliding
over
the
ground
then
his
heart
caused
him
even
greater
anguish
he
could
not
rise
but
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
and
lay
there
when
the
robber
folk
and
the
lay
brother
had
groped
their
way
back
to
the
cave
they
missed
abbot
hans
they
took
brands
with
them
and
went
out
to
search
for
him
they
found
him
dead
upon
the
coverlet
of
snow
then
the
lay
brother
began
weeping
and
lamenting
for
he
understood
that
it
was
he
who
had
killed
abbot
hans
because
he
had
dashed
from
him
the
cup
of
happiness
which
he
had
been
thirsting
to
drain
to
its
last
drop
when
abbot
hans
had
been
carried
down
to
övid
those
who
took
charge
of
the
dead
saw
that
he
held
his
right
hand
locked
tight
around
something
which
he
must
have
grasped
at
the
moment
of
death
when
they
finally
got
his
hand
open
they
found
that
the
thing
which
he
had
held
in
such
an
iron
grip
was
a
pair
of
white
root
bulbs
which
he
had
torn
from
among
the
moss
and
leaves
when
the
lay
brother
who
had
accompanied
abbot
hans
saw
the
bulbs
he
took
them
and
planted
them
in
abbot
hans
herb
garden
he
guarded
them
the
whole
year
to
see
if
any
flower
would
spring
from
them
but
in
vain
he
waited
through
the
spring
the
summer
and
the
autumn
finally
when
winter
had
set
in
and
all
the
leaves
and
the
flowers
were
dead
he
ceased
caring
for
them
but
when
christmas
eve
came
again
he
was
so
strongly
reminded
of
abbot
hans
that
he
wandered
out
into
the
garden
to
think
of
him
and
look
as
he
came
to
the
spot
where
he
had
planted
the
bare
root
bulbs
he
saw
that
from
them
had
sprung
flourishing
green
stalks
which
bore
beautiful
flowers
with
silver
white
leaves
he
called
out
all
the
monks
at
övid
and
when
they
saw
that
this
plant
bloomed
on
christmas
eve
when
all
the
other
growths
were
as
if
dead
they
understood
that
this
flower
had
in
truth
been
plucked
by
abbot
hans
from
the
christmas
garden
in
göinge
forest
then
the
lay
brother
asked
the
monks
if
he
might
take
a
few
blossoms
to
bishop
absalon
and
when
he
appeared
before
bishop
absalon
he
gave
him
the
flowers
and
said
abbot
hans
sends
you
these
they
are
the
flowers
he
promised
to
pick
for
you
from
the
garden
in
göinge
forest
when
bishop
absalon
beheld
the
flowers
which
had
sprung
from
the
earth
in
darkest
winter
and
heard
the
words
he
turned
as
pale
as
if
he
had
met
a
ghost
he
sat
in
silence
a
moment
thereupon
he
said
abbot
hans
has
faithfully
kept
his
word
and
i
shall
also
keep
mine
and
he
ordered
that
a
letter
of
ransom
be
drawn
up
for
the
wild
robber
who
was
outlawed
and
had
been
forced
to
live
in
the
forest
ever
since
his
youth
he
handed
the
letter
to
the
lay
brother
who
departed
at
once
for
the
robbers
cave
when
he
stepped
in
there
on
christmas
day
the
robber
came
toward
him
with
axe
uplifted
i
like
to
hack
you
monks
into
bits
as
many
as
you
are
said
he
it
must
be
your
fault
that
göinge
forest
did
not
last
night
dress
itself
in
christmas
bloom
the
fault
is
mine
alone
said
the
lay
brother
and
i
will
gladly
die
for
it
but
first
i
must
deliver
a
message
from
abbot
hans
and
he
drew
forth
the
bishop
letter
and
told
the
man
that
he
was
free
hereafter
you
and
your
children
shall
play
in
the
christmas
straw
and
celebrate
your
christmas
among
people
just
as
abbot
hans
wished
to
have
it
said
he
then
robber
father
stood
there
pale
and
speechless
but
robber
mother
said
in
his
name
abbot
hans
has
indeed
kept
his
word
and
robber
father
will
keep
his
when
the
robber
and
his
wife
left
the
cave
the
lay
brother
moved
in
and
lived
all
alone
in
the
forest
in
constant
meditation
and
prayer
that
his
might
be
forgiven
him
but
göinge
forest
never
again
celebrated
the
hour
of
our
birth
and
of
all
its
glory
there
lives
only
the
plant
which
abbot
hans
had
plucked
it
has
been
named
christmas
rose
and
each
year
at
christmastide
she
sends
forth
from
the
earth
her
green
stalks
and
white
blossoms
as
if
she
never
could
forget
that
she
had
once
grown
in
the
great
christmas
garden
at
göinge
forest
a
story
from
jerusalem
in
the
old
and
mosque
el
aksa
in
jerusalem
there
is
a
long
winding
path
leading
from
the
main
entrance
up
to
a
very
deep
and
wide
in
this
niche
a
very
old
and
much
worn
rug
is
spread
and
upon
this
rug
day
in
and
day
out
sits
old
mesullam
who
is
a
and
and
who
for
a
paltry
penny
serves
the
visitors
to
the
mosque
by
prying
into
their
future
destinies
it
happened
one
afternoon
several
years
ago
that
mesullam
who
sat
as
usual
in
his
window
was
so
that
he
would
even
return
the
greetings
of
the
no
one
thought
however
of
feeling
offended
at
his
rudeness
because
every
one
knew
that
he
was
grieving
over
a
humiliation
which
had
been
put
upon
him
that
day
at
that
time
a
mighty
monarch
from
the
occident
was
visiting
jerusalem
and
in
the
forenoon
the
distinguished
stranger
with
his
retinue
had
wandered
through
el
aksa
before
his
arrival
the
superintendent
of
the
mosque
had
commanded
the
servants
to
scour
and
dust
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
old
building
at
the
same
time
giving
orders
that
mesullam
should
move
out
of
his
accustomed
place
he
had
found
that
it
would
be
simply
impossible
to
let
him
remain
there
during
the
visit
of
the
distinguished
guest
it
was
not
only
that
his
rug
was
very
ragged
or
that
he
had
piled
up
around
him
a
lot
of
dirty
sacks
in
which
he
kept
his
belongings
but
mesullam
himself
was
anything
but
an
ornament
to
the
mosque
he
was
in
reality
an
inconceivably
ugly
old
negro
his
lips
were
enormous
his
chin
protruded
aggressively
his
brow
was
exceedingly
low
and
his
nose
was
almost
like
a
snout
and
in
addition
to
these
mesullam
had
a
coarse
and
wrinkled
skin
and
a
clumsy
body
which
was
carelessly
draped
in
a
dirty
white
shawl
so
one
ca
wonder
that
he
was
forbidden
to
show
himself
in
the
mosque
while
the
honored
guest
was
there
poor
mesullam
who
knew
well
enough
that
despite
his
ugliness
he
was
a
very
wise
man
experienced
a
bitter
disappointment
in
that
was
not
to
see
the
royal
traveller
he
had
hoped
that
he
might
give
him
some
proofs
of
the
great
accomplishments
which
he
possessed
in
occult
things
and
in
this
way
add
to
his
own
glory
and
renown
since
this
hope
had
miscarried
he
sat
hour
after
hour
in
a
queer
position
and
mourned
with
his
long
arms
stretched
upward
and
his
head
thrown
far
back
as
though
he
were
calling
upon
heaven
for
justice
when
it
drew
on
toward
evening
mesullam
was
wakened
from
his
state
of
grief
by
a
cheery
voice
calling
him
it
was
a
syrian
who
accompanied
by
another
traveller
had
come
up
to
the
soothsayer
he
told
him
that
the
stranger
whom
he
was
conducting
wished
for
a
proof
of
oriental
wisdom
and
that
he
had
spoken
to
him
of
mesullam
ability
to
interpret
dreams
mesullam
answered
not
a
word
to
this
but
maintained
his
former
attitude
rigidly
when
the
guide
asked
him
again
if
he
would
not
listen
to
the
dreams
the
stranger
wished
to
relate
to
him
and
interpret
them
his
arms
dropped
and
he
crossed
them
on
his
breast
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
wronged
man
he
answered
that
this
evening
his
soul
was
so
filled
with
his
own
troubles
that
he
could
judge
anything
clearly
which
concerned
another
but
the
stranger
who
had
a
buoyant
and
commanding
personality
seem
to
mind
his
objections
as
there
was
no
chair
handy
he
kicked
aside
the
rug
and
seated
himself
in
the
then
he
began
in
a
clear
and
vibrant
voice
to
narrate
a
few
dreams
which
later
were
translated
for
the
soothsayer
by
the
guide
tell
him
said
the
traveller
that
a
few
years
ago
i
was
at
cairo
in
egypt
since
he
is
a
learned
man
naturally
he
knows
there
is
a
mosque
there
called
el
azhar
which
is
the
most
celebrated
institution
of
learning
in
the
orient
i
went
there
one
day
to
visit
it
and
found
that
the
whole
colossal
structure
all
its
rooms
and
arcades
all
its
entrances
and
halls
were
filled
with
students
there
were
old
men
who
had
devoted
their
entire
lives
to
the
quest
for
knowledge
and
children
who
were
just
learning
to
form
their
letters
there
were
giantesque
negroes
from
the
heart
of
africa
lithe
handsome
youths
from
india
and
arabia
strangers
from
barbary
from
georgia
from
every
land
where
the
natives
embrace
the
doctrines
of
the
koran
close
to
the
pillars
i
was
told
that
in
el
azhar
there
were
as
many
teachers
as
there
were
pillars
the
instructors
were
squatted
on
their
rugs
while
their
students
who
were
arranged
in
a
circle
around
them
eagerly
followed
their
lectures
which
were
accompanied
by
swaying
movements
of
their
bodies
and
tell
him
that
although
el
azhar
is
in
no
way
comparable
to
the
great
occidental
seats
of
learning
i
was
nevertheless
astonished
at
what
i
saw
there
i
remarked
to
myself
this
is
islam
great
stronghold
and
defence
from
here
mohammed
young
champions
go
out
here
at
el
azhar
the
potions
of
wisdom
that
keep
the
koran
doctrines
healthy
and
vigorous
are
blended
all
of
this
the
traveller
said
almost
in
one
breath
now
he
made
a
pause
so
that
the
guide
would
have
an
opportunity
to
interpret
for
the
soothsayer
then
he
continued
now
tell
him
that
el
azhar
made
such
a
powerful
impression
upon
me
that
on
the
following
night
i
saw
it
again
in
a
dream
i
saw
the
white
marble
structure
and
the
many
students
dressed
in
white
mantles
and
white
turbans
as
is
the
custom
at
el
azhar
i
wandered
through
halls
and
courts
and
was
again
astonished
at
what
a
splendid
fortress
and
wall
of
protection
this
was
for
mohammedanism
finally
in
the
dream
i
came
to
the
minaret
upon
which
the
stands
to
inform
the
faithful
that
the
hour
of
prayer
has
struck
and
i
saw
the
stairway
which
winds
up
to
the
minaret
and
i
saw
a
walking
up
the
steps
he
wore
a
black
mantle
and
a
white
turban
like
the
others
and
as
he
went
up
the
stairs
i
could
not
at
first
see
his
face
but
when
he
had
made
a
few
turns
on
the
spiral
stairway
he
happened
to
turn
his
face
toward
me
and
then
i
saw
that
it
was
the
speaker
made
a
short
pause
and
his
chest
was
expanded
for
a
deep
inhalation
i
shall
never
forget
although
it
was
only
a
dream
he
exclaimed
what
an
impression
it
made
upon
me
to
see
christ
walking
up
the
steps
to
the
minaret
in
el
azhar
to
me
it
seemed
so
glorious
and
significant
that
he
had
come
to
this
stronghold
of
islam
to
call
out
the
hours
of
prayer
that
i
leaped
up
in
the
dream
and
awaked
here
the
traveller
made
another
pause
to
let
the
guide
interpret
for
the
soothsayer
but
this
appeared
to
be
useless
labor
mesullam
sat
all
the
while
with
his
hands
on
his
sides
rocking
back
and
forth
and
with
his
eyes
half
closed
he
seemed
to
want
to
say
inasmuch
as
i
can
not
escape
these
importunate
people
at
least
i
will
let
them
see
that
i
do
care
to
listen
to
what
they
have
to
say
i
try
and
rock
myself
to
sleep
it
will
be
the
best
way
to
show
them
how
little
i
care
about
them
the
guide
intimated
to
the
traveller
that
all
their
trouble
would
be
in
vain
and
they
would
hear
a
sensible
word
from
mesullam
while
he
was
in
this
mood
but
the
european
stranger
seemed
to
be
entranced
by
mesullam
indescribable
ugliness
and
extraordinary
behavior
he
looked
at
him
with
the
pleasure
of
a
child
when
it
is
watching
a
wild
animal
in
a
menagerie
and
he
desired
to
continue
the
interview
tell
him
that
i
would
have
troubled
him
to
interpret
this
dream
he
said
had
it
not
in
a
certain
sense
come
to
me
again
let
him
know
that
two
weeks
ago
i
visited
the
sophia
mosque
at
constantinople
and
that
i
after
wandering
through
this
magnificent
building
stepped
up
on
a
minaret
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
auditorium
tell
him
also
that
they
allowed
me
to
come
into
the
mosque
during
a
service
when
it
was
filled
with
people
upon
each
of
the
innumerable
prayer
rugs
which
covered
the
whole
floor
of
the
main
hall
a
man
was
standing
and
saying
his
prayers
all
who
took
part
in
the
service
simultaneously
made
the
same
movements
all
fell
upon
their
knees
and
threw
themselves
on
their
faces
and
raised
themselves
at
the
same
time
whispering
their
prayers
very
low
but
from
the
almost
imperceptible
movements
of
so
many
lips
came
a
mysterious
murmur
which
rose
toward
the
high
arches
and
died
away
time
and
again
then
there
came
melodious
responses
from
remote
passages
and
galleries
it
was
so
strange
altogether
that
one
wondered
if
it
was
not
the
spirit
of
god
that
poured
into
the
old
sanctuary
the
traveller
made
another
pause
he
observed
mesullam
carefully
while
the
guide
interpreted
his
speech
it
actually
appeared
as
if
he
had
tried
to
win
the
negro
approbation
with
his
eloquence
and
it
seemed
too
as
though
he
would
succeed
for
mesullam
eyes
flashed
once
like
a
coal
that
is
beginning
to
take
fire
but
the
soothsayer
stubborn
as
a
child
that
will
not
let
itself
be
amused
dropped
his
head
on
his
breast
and
began
an
even
more
impatient
rocking
of
his
body
tell
him
resumed
the
stranger
tell
him
that
i
have
never
seen
people
pray
with
such
fervor
to
me
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
the
sublime
beauty
of
this
marvellous
structure
which
created
this
atmosphere
of
ecstasy
verily
this
is
still
an
islam
bulwark
this
is
the
home
of
devoutness
from
this
great
mosque
emanate
the
faith
and
enthusiasm
which
make
islam
a
mighty
power
here
he
paused
again
noting
carefully
mesullam
play
of
features
during
its
interpretation
not
a
trace
of
interest
was
discernible
in
them
but
the
stranger
was
evidently
a
man
who
liked
to
hear
himself
talk
his
own
words
intoxicated
him
he
would
have
become
had
he
not
been
allowed
to
proceed
well
said
he
when
it
was
his
turn
again
to
speak
i
can
not
rightly
explain
what
happened
to
me
possibly
the
faint
odor
from
the
hundreds
of
oil
lamps
together
with
the
low
murmurings
of
the
devotees
lulled
me
into
a
kind
of
stupefaction
i
could
not
help
but
close
my
eyes
as
i
stood
leaning
against
a
pillar
soon
sleep
or
rather
insensibility
overcame
me
probably
it
did
not
last
more
than
a
minute
but
during
this
interval
i
was
entirely
removed
from
reality
while
in
this
trance
i
could
see
the
whole
sophia
mosque
before
me
with
all
the
praying
people
but
now
i
saw
what
i
had
not
hitherto
observed
up
in
the
dome
were
scaffoldings
and
on
these
stood
a
number
of
workmen
with
paint
pots
and
brushes
tell
him
if
he
does
not
already
know
it
continued
the
narrator
that
sophia
mosque
was
once
a
christian
church
and
that
its
arches
and
dome
are
covered
with
sacred
christian
mosaics
although
the
turks
have
painted
out
all
these
pictures
with
plain
yellow
paint
and
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
the
yellow
paint
in
the
dome
had
peeled
off
in
a
couple
of
places
and
that
the
painters
had
clambered
up
on
the
scaffolding
to
touch
up
the
picture
but
look
when
one
of
them
raised
his
brush
to
fill
in
the
color
another
large
piece
scaled
off
and
suddenly
one
saw
from
behind
it
a
beautiful
painting
of
the
emerge
again
the
painter
raised
his
arm
to
paint
out
the
picture
but
the
arm
which
appeared
to
be
numb
and
powerless
dropped
down
before
this
beautiful
face
at
the
same
time
the
paint
dropped
from
the
entire
dome
and
arch
and
christ
was
visible
there
in
all
his
glory
among
angels
and
heavenly
hosts
then
the
painter
cried
out
and
all
the
worshippers
down
on
the
floor
of
the
mosque
raised
their
heads
and
when
they
saw
the
heavenly
hosts
surrounding
the
saviour
they
sent
up
a
cry
of
joy
and
when
i
witnessed
this
joy
i
was
seized
with
such
strong
emotion
that
i
waked
instantly
then
everything
was
like
itself
the
mosaics
were
hidden
under
the
yellow
paint
and
the
devotees
continued
all
the
while
to
invoke
allah
when
the
interpreter
had
translated
this
mesullam
opened
one
eye
and
regarded
the
stranger
he
saw
a
man
who
he
thought
resembled
all
other
occidentals
that
wandered
through
the
mosque
i
do
believe
the
stranger
has
seen
any
visions
thought
he
he
has
not
the
dark
eyes
that
can
see
what
is
behind
the
veil
of
mystery
i
think
rather
that
he
came
here
to
make
sport
of
me
i
must
beware
lest
on
this
accursed
day
i
be
overtaken
by
another
humiliation
the
stranger
spoke
anon
you
know
o
dream
interpreter
turning
now
direct
to
mesullam
as
if
he
thought
that
he
could
understand
him
despite
his
foreign
tongue
you
know
that
a
distinguished
foreigner
is
visiting
jerusalem
at
present
and
on
his
account
they
have
talked
of
opening
the
gate
in
jerusalem
the
one
they
call
golden
and
which
is
believed
to
be
the
gate
through
which
jesus
rode
into
jerusalem
on
palm
sunday
they
have
actually
been
thinking
of
doing
the
distinguished
traveller
the
honor
of
letting
him
ride
into
the
city
through
a
gate
which
has
been
walled
up
for
centuries
but
they
were
held
back
by
an
old
prophecy
which
foretells
that
when
this
gate
is
opened
the
occidentals
will
march
in
through
it
to
take
possession
of
jerusalem
and
now
you
shall
hear
what
happened
to
me
last
night
the
weather
was
superb
it
was
glorious
moonlight
and
i
had
gone
out
alone
to
take
a
quiet
promenade
around
the
holy
city
i
walked
outside
the
on
the
narrow
path
that
extends
all
round
the
wall
and
my
thoughts
were
borne
so
far
back
into
distant
ages
that
i
scarcely
remembered
where
i
was
all
of
a
sudden
i
began
to
feel
tired
i
wondered
if
i
should
not
soon
come
to
a
gate
in
the
wall
through
which
i
might
get
into
the
city
and
thus
return
to
my
quarters
by
a
shorter
road
well
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
this
i
saw
a
man
open
a
large
gate
in
the
wall
directly
in
front
of
me
he
opened
it
wide
and
beckoned
to
me
that
i
might
pass
in
through
it
i
was
absorbed
in
my
dreams
and
hardly
knew
how
far
i
had
been
walking
i
was
somewhat
surprised
that
there
was
a
gate
here
but
i
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
and
walked
through
it
as
soon
as
i
had
passed
through
the
deep
archway
the
gate
closed
with
a
sharp
clang
when
i
turned
round
there
was
no
opening
visible
only
a
gate
the
one
called
the
golden
before
me
lay
the
temple
place
the
broad
haram
plateau
in
the
centre
of
which
omar
mosque
is
enthroned
and
you
know
that
no
gate
in
the
leads
thither
but
the
golden
which
is
not
only
closed
but
walled
up
you
can
understand
that
i
thought
i
gone
mad
that
i
dreamed
i
had
tried
in
vain
to
find
some
explanation
of
this
i
looked
around
for
the
man
who
had
let
me
in
he
had
vanished
and
i
could
not
find
him
but
on
the
other
hand
i
saw
him
all
the
plainer
in
memory
the
tall
and
slightly
bent
figure
the
beautiful
locks
the
mild
visage
the
parted
beard
it
was
soothsayer
once
again
tell
me
now
you
who
can
look
into
the
hidden
what
mean
my
dreams
what
more
than
all
can
be
the
meaning
of
my
having
really
and
truly
passed
through
the
golden
gate
even
at
this
moment
i
do
not
know
how
it
happened
but
i
have
done
so
tell
me
now
what
these
three
things
can
mean
the
interpreter
translated
this
for
mesullam
but
the
soothsayer
was
all
the
while
in
the
same
suspicious
and
crabbed
mood
i
am
certain
that
this
stranger
wants
to
poke
fun
at
me
he
thought
perchance
he
would
provoke
me
to
anger
with
all
this
talk
about
christ
he
would
have
concluded
not
to
answer
at
all
but
when
the
interpreter
insisted
he
muttered
a
few
words
what
does
he
say
asked
the
traveller
eagerly
he
says
he
has
nothing
to
say
to
you
but
that
dreams
are
dreams
then
tell
him
from
me
retorted
the
stranger
somewhat
exasperated
that
this
is
not
always
true
it
depends
entirely
upon
who
dreams
them
before
these
words
had
been
interpreted
to
mesullam
the
european
had
arisen
and
with
quick
and
elastic
step
had
walked
toward
the
long
but
mesullam
sat
still
and
mused
over
his
answer
for
five
minutes
then
he
fell
upon
his
face
utterly
undone
allah
allah
twice
on
the
same
day
fortune
has
passed
by
me
without
my
having
captured
her
what
hath
thy
servant
done
to
displease
thee
why
the
pope
lived
to
be
so
old
it
happened
at
rome
in
the
early
nineties
leo
xiii
was
just
then
at
the
height
of
his
fame
and
greatness
all
true
catholics
rejoiced
at
his
successes
and
triumphs
which
in
truth
were
sublime
and
even
for
those
who
could
not
grasp
the
great
political
events
it
was
plain
that
the
power
of
the
church
was
again
coming
to
the
front
any
one
at
all
could
see
that
new
cloisters
were
going
up
everywhere
and
that
throngs
of
pilgrims
were
beginning
to
pour
into
italy
as
in
olden
times
in
many
many
places
one
saw
the
old
dilapidated
churches
in
process
of
restoration
damaged
mosaics
being
put
in
order
and
the
of
the
churches
being
filled
with
golden
and
jewelled
exhibits
right
in
the
midst
of
this
progressive
period
the
roman
people
were
alarmed
by
the
news
that
the
pope
had
been
taken
ill
he
was
said
to
be
in
a
very
precarious
condition
it
was
even
rumored
that
he
was
dying
his
condition
was
too
in
a
great
degree
serious
the
pope
physicians
issued
bulletins
which
inspired
but
little
hope
it
was
maintained
that
the
pope
great
age
he
was
then
eighty
years
old
made
it
seem
almost
incredible
that
he
could
survive
this
attack
naturally
the
pope
illness
caused
great
unrest
in
all
the
churches
in
rome
prayers
were
said
for
his
recovery
the
newspapers
were
filled
with
communications
regarding
the
progress
of
the
illness
the
cardinals
were
beginning
to
take
steps
and
measures
for
the
new
papal
election
everywhere
they
bemoaned
the
approaching
demise
of
the
brilliant
leader
they
feared
that
the
good
fortune
which
had
followed
the
standard
under
leo
xiii
might
not
be
faithful
to
it
under
the
leadership
of
his
successor
there
were
many
who
had
hoped
that
this
pope
would
succeed
in
winning
back
rome
and
the
ecclesiastical
states
others
again
had
dreamed
that
he
would
bring
back
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
some
of
the
large
protestant
countries
for
each
second
that
was
passing
fear
and
anxiety
grew
apace
as
night
came
on
in
many
homes
the
inmates
would
not
retire
the
churches
were
kept
open
until
long
past
midnight
that
the
anxious
ones
might
have
an
opportunity
to
go
in
and
pray
among
these
throngs
of
devotees
there
was
certainly
more
than
one
poor
soul
who
cried
out
dear
lord
take
my
life
instead
of
his
let
him
who
has
done
so
much
for
thy
glory
live
and
extinguish
instead
my
which
burns
to
no
one
use
but
if
the
angel
of
death
had
taken
one
of
these
devotees
at
his
word
and
had
suddenly
stepped
up
to
him
with
sword
raised
to
exact
the
fulfilment
of
his
promise
one
might
wonder
somewhat
as
to
how
he
would
have
behaved
no
doubt
he
would
have
recalled
instantly
such
a
rash
proffer
and
begged
for
the
grace
of
being
allowed
to
live
out
all
the
years
of
his
allotted
time
at
this
time
there
lived
an
old
woman
in
one
of
the
dingy
ramshackle
houses
along
the
tiber
she
was
one
of
those
who
have
the
kind
of
spirit
that
thanks
god
every
day
for
life
every
morning
she
used
to
sit
at
the
and
sell
garden
truck
and
this
was
an
occupation
that
was
very
congenial
to
her
she
thought
nothing
could
be
livelier
than
a
market
of
a
morning
all
tongues
were
wagging
all
were
harking
their
commodities
and
buyers
crowded
in
front
of
the
stalls
selected
and
bargained
and
many
a
good
sally
passed
between
buyer
and
seller
sometimes
the
old
woman
was
successful
in
making
a
good
deal
and
in
selling
out
her
entire
stock
but
even
if
she
could
sell
so
much
as
a
radish
she
loved
to
be
standing
amongst
flowers
and
green
things
in
the
fresh
morning
air
in
the
evening
she
had
another
and
an
even
greater
pleasure
then
her
son
came
home
and
visited
with
her
he
was
a
priest
but
he
had
been
assigned
to
a
little
church
in
one
of
the
humble
quarters
the
poor
priests
who
served
there
had
not
much
to
live
upon
and
the
mother
feared
that
her
son
was
starving
but
from
this
also
she
derived
much
pleasure
for
it
gave
her
the
opportunity
of
stuffing
him
full
of
delicacies
when
he
came
to
see
her
he
struggled
against
it
as
he
was
destined
for
a
life
of
and
strict
discipline
but
his
mother
became
so
distressed
when
he
said
no
that
he
always
had
to
give
in
while
he
was
eating
she
trotted
around
in
the
room
and
chattered
about
all
that
she
had
seen
in
the
morning
during
market
hours
these
were
all
very
worldly
matters
and
it
would
occur
to
her
sometimes
that
her
son
might
be
offended
then
she
would
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
begin
to
talk
of
spiritual
and
solemn
things
but
the
priest
could
help
laughing
no
no
mother
concenza
he
said
continue
in
your
usual
way
the
saints
know
you
already
and
they
know
what
you
are
up
to
then
she
too
laughed
and
said
you
are
quite
right
it
does
pay
to
pretend
before
the
good
lord
when
the
pope
was
taken
ill
signora
concenza
must
also
have
a
share
in
the
general
grief
of
her
own
accord
it
certainly
never
would
have
occurred
to
her
to
feel
troubled
about
his
passing
but
when
her
son
came
home
to
her
she
could
neither
persuade
him
to
taste
of
a
morsel
of
food
nor
to
give
her
a
smile
although
she
was
simply
bubbling
over
with
stories
and
interpolations
naturally
she
became
alarmed
and
asked
what
was
wrong
with
him
the
holy
father
is
ill
answered
the
son
at
first
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
this
was
the
cause
of
his
downheartedness
of
course
it
was
a
sorrow
but
she
knew
to
be
sure
that
if
a
pope
died
immediately
there
would
come
another
she
reminded
her
son
of
the
fact
that
they
had
also
mourned
the
good
pio
nono
and
you
see
the
one
who
succeeded
him
was
a
still
greater
pope
surely
the
cardinals
would
choose
for
them
a
ruler
who
was
just
as
holy
and
wise
as
this
one
the
priest
then
began
telling
her
about
the
pope
he
did
bother
to
initiate
her
into
his
system
of
government
but
he
told
her
little
stories
of
his
childhood
and
young
manhood
and
from
the
days
of
his
prelacy
there
were
also
things
to
relate
as
for
instance
how
he
had
at
one
time
hunted
down
robbers
in
southern
italy
how
he
had
made
himself
beloved
by
the
poor
and
needy
during
the
years
when
he
was
a
bishop
in
perugia
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
cried
out
ah
if
he
were
not
so
old
if
he
might
only
be
allowed
to
live
many
more
years
since
he
is
such
a
great
and
holy
man
ah
if
only
he
were
not
so
old
sighed
the
son
but
signora
concenza
had
already
brushed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
you
really
must
bear
this
calmly
said
she
remember
that
his
years
of
life
are
simply
run
out
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
death
from
seizing
him
the
priest
was
a
dreamer
he
loved
the
church
and
had
dreamed
that
the
great
pope
would
lead
her
on
to
important
and
decisive
victories
i
would
give
my
life
if
i
could
purchase
new
life
for
him
said
he
what
are
you
saying
cried
his
mother
do
you
really
love
him
so
much
but
in
any
case
you
must
not
express
such
dangerous
wishes
instead
you
should
think
of
living
a
good
long
time
who
knows
what
may
happen
why
could
you
in
your
turn
become
pope
a
night
and
a
day
passed
without
any
improvement
in
the
condition
when
signora
concenza
met
her
son
the
following
day
he
looked
completely
undone
she
understood
that
he
had
passed
the
whole
day
in
prayer
and
fasting
and
she
began
to
feel
deeply
grieved
i
verily
believe
that
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
for
the
sake
of
that
sick
old
man
said
she
the
son
was
hurt
by
again
finding
her
without
sympathy
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
sympathize
a
little
with
his
grief
you
truly
more
than
any
one
else
ought
to
wish
that
the
pope
might
live
he
said
if
he
may
continue
to
rule
he
will
name
my
parish
priest
for
bishop
before
the
year
shall
have
passed
and
in
that
event
my
fortune
is
made
he
will
then
give
me
a
good
place
in
a
cathedral
you
shall
not
see
me
going
about
any
more
in
a
cassock
i
shall
have
plenty
of
money
and
i
shall
be
able
to
help
you
and
all
your
poor
neighbors
but
if
the
pope
dies
asked
signora
concenza
breathlessly
if
the
pope
dies
then
no
one
can
know
if
my
parish
priest
happen
to
be
in
favor
with
his
successor
we
must
both
remain
where
we
now
are
for
many
years
to
come
signora
concenza
came
close
to
her
son
and
regarded
him
anxiously
she
looked
at
his
brow
which
was
covered
with
wrinkles
and
at
his
hair
that
was
just
turning
gray
he
looked
tired
and
worn
it
was
actually
imperative
that
he
should
have
that
place
at
the
cathedral
right
away
i
shall
go
to
church
and
pray
for
the
pope
thought
she
it
wo
do
for
him
to
die
after
supper
she
bravely
conquered
her
fatigue
and
went
out
on
the
streets
great
crowds
of
people
thronged
there
many
were
only
curious
and
had
gone
out
because
they
wished
to
catch
the
news
of
the
death
at
first
hand
but
many
were
really
distressed
and
wandered
from
church
to
church
to
pray
as
soon
as
signora
concenza
had
come
out
on
the
street
she
met
one
of
her
daughters
who
was
married
to
a
lithographer
oh
mother
but
you
do
right
to
come
out
and
pray
for
him
exclaimed
the
daughter
you
ca
imagine
what
a
misfortune
it
would
be
if
he
were
to
die
my
fabiano
was
ready
to
take
his
own
life
when
he
learned
that
the
pope
was
she
related
how
her
husband
the
lithographer
had
but
just
struck
off
hundreds
of
thousands
of
the
pope
pictures
now
if
the
pope
were
to
die
he
would
be
able
to
sell
half
of
them
no
not
even
a
quarter
of
them
he
would
be
ruined
their
entire
fortune
was
at
stake
she
rushed
on
to
gather
some
fresh
news
wherewith
she
might
comfort
her
poor
husband
who
did
not
dare
venture
out
but
sat
at
home
and
brooded
over
his
misfortune
her
mother
stood
still
on
the
street
mumbling
to
herself
it
wo
do
for
him
to
die
it
will
never
do
for
him
to
die
she
walked
into
the
first
church
she
came
to
there
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
prayed
for
the
life
of
the
pope
as
she
arose
to
leave
she
happened
to
lift
her
eyes
to
a
little
votive
tablet
which
hung
on
the
wall
just
above
her
head
the
tablet
was
a
representation
of
death
raising
a
terrifying
sword
to
mow
down
a
young
girl
while
her
mother
who
had
cast
herself
in
his
path
tries
in
vain
to
receive
the
blow
in
place
of
her
child
she
stood
long
before
the
picture
musing
signor
death
is
a
careful
arithmetician
she
remarked
one
has
never
heard
of
his
agreeing
to
exchange
an
old
person
for
a
young
one
she
remembered
her
son
words
that
he
would
be
willing
to
die
in
the
pope
stead
and
a
shudder
passed
through
her
whole
body
think
if
death
were
to
take
him
at
his
word
no
no
signor
death
she
whispered
you
must
believe
him
you
must
understand
that
he
did
mean
what
he
said
he
wants
to
live
he
does
want
to
leave
his
old
mother
who
loves
him
for
the
first
time
the
thought
struck
her
that
if
any
one
should
sacrifice
himself
for
the
pope
it
were
better
that
she
did
it
she
who
was
already
old
and
had
lived
her
life
when
she
left
the
church
she
happened
into
the
company
of
some
nuns
of
the
saintliest
and
most
devout
appearance
who
lived
in
the
northern
part
of
the
country
they
had
travelled
down
to
rome
to
obtain
a
little
help
from
the
pope
treasury
we
are
actually
in
the
most
dire
need
of
aid
they
told
old
concenza
only
think
our
convent
was
so
old
and
dilapidated
that
it
blew
down
during
the
severe
storm
of
last
winter
we
may
not
now
present
our
case
to
him
if
he
should
die
we
must
return
home
with
an
unaccomplished
mission
who
can
know
if
his
successor
will
be
the
sort
of
man
who
will
trouble
himself
to
succor
poor
nuns
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
people
were
thinking
the
same
thoughts
it
was
very
easy
to
get
into
converse
with
any
one
each
and
all
whom
signora
concenza
approached
let
her
know
that
the
pope
death
would
be
for
them
a
terrible
misfortune
the
old
woman
repeated
again
and
again
to
herself
my
son
is
right
it
will
never
do
for
the
pope
to
die
a
nurse
was
standing
among
a
group
of
people
talking
in
a
loud
voice
she
was
so
affected
that
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
she
related
how
five
years
ago
she
had
been
ordered
away
to
serve
at
a
leper
hospital
on
an
island
at
the
other
end
of
the
globe
naturally
she
had
to
obey
orders
but
she
did
so
against
her
wishes
she
had
felt
a
horrible
dread
of
this
mission
before
she
left
rome
she
was
received
by
the
pope
who
had
given
her
a
special
blessing
and
had
also
promised
her
that
if
she
came
back
alive
she
should
have
another
audience
with
him
and
it
was
upon
this
that
she
had
lived
during
the
five
years
she
had
been
away
only
on
the
hope
that
she
might
see
the
holy
father
once
more
in
this
life
this
had
helped
her
to
go
through
all
the
horrors
and
now
when
she
had
got
home
at
last
she
was
met
by
the
news
that
he
lay
upon
his
she
could
not
even
see
him
she
was
in
extreme
despair
and
old
concenza
was
deeply
moved
it
would
really
be
much
too
great
a
sorrow
for
every
one
if
the
pope
were
to
die
thought
she
as
she
wandered
farther
up
the
street
when
she
observed
that
many
of
the
looked
perfectly
exhausted
from
weeping
she
thought
with
a
sense
of
relief
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
see
everybody
happiness
if
the
pope
should
recover
and
she
like
many
others
who
have
a
buoyant
disposition
was
apparently
no
more
afraid
of
dying
than
of
living
so
she
said
to
herself
if
i
only
knew
how
it
could
be
done
i
would
gladly
give
the
holy
father
the
years
that
are
left
to
me
of
life
she
said
this
somewhat
in
jest
but
back
of
the
words
there
was
also
seriousness
she
truly
wished
that
she
might
realize
something
in
that
way
an
old
woman
could
not
wish
for
a
more
beautiful
death
thought
she
i
would
be
helping
both
my
son
and
my
daughter
and
besides
i
should
make
great
masses
of
people
happy
just
as
this
thought
stirred
within
her
she
raised
the
patched
curtain
which
hung
before
the
entrance
of
a
gloomy
little
church
it
was
one
of
the
very
old
churches
one
of
those
which
appear
to
be
gradually
sinking
into
the
earth
because
the
city
foundation
has
in
the
intervening
years
raised
itself
several
metres
all
around
them
this
church
in
its
interior
had
preserved
somewhat
of
its
ancient
gloom
which
must
have
come
down
through
the
dark
ages
during
which
it
had
sprung
into
existence
involuntarily
a
shudder
passed
through
one
as
one
stepped
in
under
its
low
arches
which
rested
upon
uncommonly
thick
pillars
and
saw
the
crudely
painted
saints
pictures
that
glimpsed
down
at
one
from
walls
and
altars
when
signora
concenza
came
into
this
old
church
which
was
thronged
with
worshippers
she
was
seized
with
a
mysterious
awe
and
reverence
she
felt
that
in
this
sanctuary
there
verily
lived
a
deity
beneath
the
massive
arches
hovered
something
infinitely
mighty
and
mysterious
something
which
inspired
such
a
sense
of
annihilating
superiority
that
she
felt
nervous
about
remaining
in
there
ah
this
is
no
church
where
one
goes
to
hear
a
mass
or
to
confessional
remarked
signora
concenza
to
herself
here
one
comes
when
one
is
in
great
trouble
when
one
can
be
helped
in
no
other
way
than
through
a
miracle
she
lingered
down
by
the
door
and
breathed
in
this
strange
air
of
mystery
and
gloom
i
do
even
know
to
whom
this
old
church
is
dedicated
but
i
feel
that
here
there
must
be
some
one
who
is
able
to
grant
us
that
which
we
pray
for
she
sank
down
among
the
kneeling
people
who
were
so
many
that
they
covered
the
floor
from
the
altar
to
the
door
all
the
while
that
she
herself
was
praying
she
heard
around
her
sighs
and
sobs
all
this
grief
went
to
her
heart
and
filled
it
with
greater
and
greater
compassion
oh
my
god
let
me
do
something
to
save
the
old
man
she
prayed
in
the
first
place
i
ought
to
help
my
children
and
then
all
the
other
people
every
once
in
a
while
a
thin
little
monk
stole
in
among
the
praying
and
whispered
something
in
their
ears
the
one
to
whom
he
was
speaking
instantly
stood
up
and
followed
him
into
the
sacristy
signora
concenza
soon
apprehended
what
there
was
in
question
they
are
of
the
kind
who
give
pledges
for
the
pope
recovery
thought
she
the
next
time
the
little
monk
made
his
rounds
she
rose
up
and
went
with
him
it
was
a
perfectly
involuntary
action
she
fancied
that
she
was
being
impelled
to
do
this
by
the
power
which
ruled
in
the
old
church
as
soon
as
she
came
into
the
sacristy
which
was
even
more
archaic
and
more
mystical
than
the
church
itself
she
regretted
it
what
have
i
to
do
in
here
she
asked
herself
what
have
i
to
give
away
i
own
nothing
but
a
couple
of
cartloads
of
garden
truck
i
certainly
ca
present
the
saints
with
a
few
baskets
of
artichokes
at
one
side
of
the
room
there
was
a
long
table
at
which
a
priest
stood
recording
in
a
register
all
that
was
pledged
to
the
saints
concenza
heard
how
one
promised
to
present
the
old
church
with
a
sum
of
money
while
a
second
promised
to
give
his
gold
watch
and
a
third
her
pearl
earrings
concenza
stood
all
the
while
down
by
the
door
her
last
poor
copper
had
been
spent
to
procure
a
few
delicacies
for
her
son
she
saw
a
number
of
persons
who
appeared
to
be
no
richer
than
herself
buying
wax
candles
and
silver
hearts
she
turned
her
skirt
pocket
inside
out
but
she
could
not
afford
even
that
much
she
stood
and
waited
so
long
that
finally
she
was
the
only
stranger
in
the
sacristy
the
priests
walking
about
in
there
looked
at
her
a
little
astonished
then
she
took
a
step
or
two
forward
she
seemed
at
the
start
uncertain
and
embarrassed
but
after
the
first
move
she
walked
lightly
and
briskly
up
to
the
table
your
reverence
she
said
to
the
priest
write
that
concenza
zamponi
who
was
sixty
last
year
on
saint
john
the
baptist
day
gives
all
her
remaining
years
to
the
pope
that
the
thread
of
his
life
may
be
lengthened
the
priest
had
already
begun
writing
he
was
probably
very
tired
after
having
worked
at
this
register
the
whole
night
and
thought
no
more
about
the
sort
of
things
he
was
recording
but
now
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
word
and
looked
quizzically
at
signora
concenza
she
met
his
glance
very
calmly
i
am
strong
and
well
your
reverence
said
she
i
should
probably
have
lived
out
my
allotted
seventy
years
it
is
at
least
ten
years
that
i
am
giving
to
the
holy
father
the
priest
marked
her
zeal
and
reverence
and
offered
no
objections
she
is
a
poor
woman
thought
he
she
has
nothing
else
to
give
it
is
written
my
daughter
he
said
when
old
concenza
came
out
from
the
church
it
was
so
late
that
the
commotion
had
ceased
and
the
streets
were
absolutely
deserted
she
found
herself
in
a
remote
part
of
the
city
where
the
gas
lamps
were
so
far
apart
that
they
dispelled
only
a
very
little
of
the
darkness
all
the
same
she
walked
on
briskly
she
felt
very
solemn
within
and
was
certain
that
she
had
done
something
which
would
make
many
people
happy
as
she
walked
up
the
street
she
suddenly
got
the
impression
that
a
live
being
circled
above
her
head
in
the
darkness
between
the
tall
houses
she
thought
she
could
distinguish
a
pair
of
large
wings
and
she
even
fancied
she
heard
the
sound
of
their
beating
what
is
this
said
she
surely
it
ca
be
a
bird
it
is
much
too
big
for
that
all
at
once
she
thought
she
saw
a
face
which
was
so
white
that
it
illuminated
the
darkness
then
an
unspeakable
terror
seized
her
it
is
the
angel
of
death
hovering
over
me
thought
she
ah
what
have
i
done
i
have
placed
myself
in
the
dreaded
one
power
she
started
to
run
but
she
could
hear
the
rustle
of
the
strong
wings
and
was
convinced
that
death
was
pursuing
her
she
fled
with
breathless
haste
through
several
streets
thinking
all
the
while
that
death
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
her
she
already
felt
his
wings
brushing
against
her
shoulder
suddenly
she
heard
a
whizzing
in
the
air
and
something
heavy
and
sharp
struck
her
head
death
sword
had
reached
her
she
sank
to
her
knees
she
knew
that
she
must
lose
her
life
a
few
hours
later
old
concenza
was
found
on
the
street
by
two
workmen
she
lay
there
unconscious
stricken
with
apoplexy
the
poor
woman
was
immediately
removed
to
a
hospital
where
they
succeeded
in
bringing
her
to
but
it
was
apparent
that
she
could
not
live
very
long
there
was
time
at
all
events
to
send
for
her
children
when
in
a
state
of
despair
they
reached
her
they
found
her
very
calm
and
happy
she
could
speak
many
words
to
them
but
she
lay
and
caressed
their
hands
you
must
be
happy
said
she
happy
happy
evidently
she
did
not
like
their
crying
she
also
bade
the
nurses
smile
and
show
their
joy
cheerful
and
happy
said
she
now
you
must
be
cheerful
and
happy
she
lay
there
with
hunger
in
her
eyes
waiting
to
see
a
little
joy
in
their
faces
she
grew
more
and
more
impatient
with
her
children
tears
and
with
the
solemn
faces
of
the
nurses
she
began
to
utter
things
which
no
one
could
comprehend
she
said
that
in
case
they
were
not
glad
she
might
just
as
well
have
lived
those
who
heard
her
thought
she
was
raving
suddenly
the
doors
opened
and
a
young
physician
came
into
the
he
was
waving
a
newspaper
and
calling
in
a
loud
voice
the
pope
is
better
he
will
live
a
change
has
taken
place
in
the
night
the
nurses
silenced
him
so
that
he
should
disturb
the
dying
woman
but
signora
concenza
had
already
heard
him
she
had
also
marked
a
spark
of
joy
a
gleam
of
happiness
which
could
not
be
concealed
pass
through
those
who
stood
around
her
bed
there
she
lay
looking
about
her
with
something
in
her
gaze
it
was
as
though
she
were
looking
out
over
rome
where
the
people
were
now
thronging
up
and
down
the
streets
and
greeting
one
another
with
the
joyful
news
she
raised
her
head
as
high
as
she
could
and
said
so
am
i
i
am
very
happy
god
has
allowed
me
to
die
that
he
may
live
i
do
mind
dying
when
i
have
made
so
many
people
happy
she
lay
down
again
and
a
few
seconds
later
she
was
dead
but
they
say
in
rome
that
after
his
recovery
the
holy
father
entertained
himself
one
day
by
looking
through
the
church
records
of
pious
pledges
which
had
been
offered
for
his
recovery
smilingly
he
read
the
long
lists
of
little
gifts
until
he
came
to
the
record
where
concenza
zamponi
had
presented
him
with
her
remaining
years
of
life
instantly
he
became
very
serious
and
thoughtful
he
made
inquiries
about
concenza
zamponi
and
learned
that
she
had
died
on
the
night
of
his
recovery
he
then
bade
them
call
to
him
her
son
dominico
and
questioned
him
minutely
as
to
her
last
moments
my
son
said
the
pope
to
him
when
he
had
spoken
your
mother
has
not
saved
my
life
as
she
believed
in
her
last
hour
but
i
am
deeply
moved
by
her
love
and
he
let
dominico
kiss
his
hand
whereupon
he
dismissed
him
but
the
romans
assure
you
that
although
the
pope
would
not
admit
that
his
span
of
years
had
been
lengthened
by
the
poor
woman
gift
he
was
nevertheless
certain
of
it
why
else
should
father
zamponi
have
had
such
a
meteoric
career
asked
the
romans
he
is
already
a
bishop
and
it
is
whispered
that
he
will
soon
be
a
cardinal
and
in
rome
they
never
feared
after
that
that
the
pope
would
die
not
even
when
he
was
mortally
ill
they
were
prepared
to
have
him
live
longer
than
other
people
his
life
had
of
course
been
lengthened
by
all
the
years
that
poor
concenza
had
given
him
the
story
of
a
story
once
there
was
a
story
that
wanted
to
be
told
and
sent
out
in
the
world
this
was
very
natural
inasmuch
as
it
knew
that
it
was
already
as
good
as
finished
many
through
remarkable
deeds
and
strange
events
had
helped
create
it
others
had
added
their
straws
in
it
by
again
and
again
relating
these
things
what
it
lacked
was
merely
a
matter
of
being
joined
together
so
that
it
could
travel
comfortably
through
the
country
as
yet
it
was
only
a
confused
jumble
of
stories
a
big
formless
cloud
of
adventures
rushing
hither
and
thither
like
a
swarm
of
stray
bees
on
a
summer
day
not
knowing
where
they
will
find
some
one
who
can
gather
them
into
a
hive
the
story
that
wanted
to
be
told
had
sprung
up
in
vermland
and
you
may
be
sure
that
it
circled
over
many
mills
and
manors
over
many
parsonages
and
many
homes
of
military
officers
in
the
beautiful
province
peering
through
the
windows
and
begging
to
be
cared
for
but
it
was
forced
to
make
many
futile
attempts
for
everywhere
it
was
turned
away
anything
else
was
hardly
to
be
expected
people
had
many
things
of
much
more
importance
to
think
of
finally
the
story
came
to
an
old
place
called
mårbacka
it
was
a
little
homestead
with
low
buildings
overshadowed
by
giant
trees
at
one
time
it
had
been
a
parsonage
and
it
was
as
if
this
had
set
a
certain
stamp
upon
the
place
which
it
could
not
lose
they
seemed
to
have
a
greater
love
for
books
and
reading
there
than
elsewhere
and
a
certain
air
of
restfulness
and
peace
always
pervaded
it
there
rushing
with
duties
and
bickering
with
servants
were
never
met
with
nor
was
hatred
or
dissension
given
house
room
either
one
who
happened
to
be
a
guest
there
was
not
allowed
to
take
life
too
seriously
but
had
to
feel
that
his
first
duty
was
to
be
and
believe
that
for
one
and
all
who
lived
on
this
estate
our
lord
managed
everything
for
the
best
as
i
think
of
the
matter
now
i
apprehend
that
the
story
of
which
i
am
speaking
must
have
lingered
thereabouts
a
great
many
years
during
its
vain
longing
to
be
told
it
seems
to
me
as
though
it
must
have
enwrapped
the
place
as
a
mist
shrouds
a
mountain
summit
now
and
then
letting
one
of
the
adventures
of
which
it
consisted
rain
down
upon
it
they
came
in
the
form
of
strange
ghost
stories
about
the
superintendent
of
the
foundries
who
always
had
black
bulls
hitched
to
his
wagon
when
he
drove
home
at
night
from
a
revel
and
in
his
home
the
evil
one
himself
used
to
sit
in
the
rocker
and
rock
while
the
wife
sat
at
the
piano
and
played
they
came
as
true
stories
from
the
neighboring
homestead
where
crows
had
persecuted
the
mistress
until
she
did
dare
venture
outside
the
door
from
the
captain
house
where
they
were
so
poor
that
everything
had
to
be
borrowed
from
the
little
cottage
down
by
the
church
where
there
lived
a
lot
of
young
and
old
girls
who
had
all
fallen
in
love
with
the
handsome
organ
builder
sometimes
the
dear
adventures
came
to
the
homestead
in
an
even
more
tangible
form
aged
and
army
officers
would
drive
up
to
the
doorstep
behind
rickety
old
horses
and
in
rickety
carryalls
they
would
stop
and
visit
for
weeks
and
in
the
evenings
when
the
toddy
had
put
courage
into
them
they
would
talk
of
the
time
when
they
had
danced
in
stockingless
shoes
so
that
their
feet
would
look
small
of
how
they
had
curled
their
hair
and
dyed
their
mustaches
one
of
them
told
how
he
had
tried
to
take
a
pretty
young
girl
back
to
her
sweetheart
and
how
he
had
been
hunted
by
wolves
on
the
way
another
had
been
at
the
christmas
feast
where
an
angered
guest
had
flung
all
the
at
the
wall
because
some
one
had
made
him
believe
they
were
crows
a
third
had
seen
the
old
gentleman
who
used
to
sit
at
a
plain
board
table
and
play
beethoven
but
the
story
could
reveal
its
presence
in
still
another
way
in
the
attic
hung
the
portrait
of
a
lady
with
powdered
hair
and
when
any
one
walked
past
it
he
was
reminded
that
it
was
a
portrait
of
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
count
who
had
loved
her
brother
young
tutor
and
had
called
to
see
him
once
when
she
was
an
old
lady
and
he
an
old
married
man
in
the
lumber
room
were
heaped
up
bundles
of
documents
containing
deeds
of
purchase
and
leases
signed
by
the
great
lady
who
once
ruled
over
seven
foundries
which
had
been
willed
to
her
by
her
lover
if
one
entered
the
church
one
saw
in
a
dusty
little
cabinet
under
the
pulpit
the
chest
filled
with
infidel
manuscripts
which
was
not
to
be
opened
until
the
beginning
of
the
new
century
and
not
very
far
from
the
church
is
the
river
at
the
bottom
of
which
rests
a
pile
of
sacred
images
that
were
not
allowed
to
remain
in
the
pulpit
and
chancel
they
once
had
ornamented
it
must
have
been
because
so
many
legends
and
traditions
hovered
around
the
farm
that
one
of
the
children
growing
up
there
longed
to
become
a
narrator
it
was
not
one
of
the
boys
they
were
not
at
home
very
much
for
they
were
away
at
their
schools
almost
the
whole
year
so
the
story
did
not
get
much
of
a
hold
upon
them
but
it
was
one
of
the
girls
one
who
was
delicate
and
could
not
romp
and
play
like
other
children
but
found
her
greatest
enjoyment
in
reading
and
hearing
stories
about
all
the
great
and
wonderful
things
which
had
happened
in
the
world
however
at
the
start
it
was
not
the
girl
intention
to
write
about
the
stories
and
legends
surrounding
her
she
had
the
remotest
idea
that
a
book
could
be
made
of
these
adventures
which
she
had
so
often
heard
related
that
to
her
they
seemed
the
most
commonplace
things
in
the
world
when
she
tried
to
write
she
chose
material
from
her
books
and
with
fresh
courage
she
strung
together
stories
of
the
sultans
in
thousand
and
one
nights
walter
scott
heroes
and
snorre
kings
of
romance
surely
it
is
needless
to
state
that
what
she
wrote
was
the
least
original
and
the
crudest
that
has
ever
been
put
upon
paper
but
this
very
naturally
she
herself
did
not
see
she
went
about
at
home
on
the
quiet
farm
filling
every
scrap
of
paper
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
with
verse
and
prose
with
plays
and
romances
when
she
was
writing
she
sat
and
waited
for
success
and
success
was
to
consist
in
this
some
stranger
who
was
very
learned
and
influential
through
some
rare
freak
of
fortune
was
to
come
and
discover
what
she
had
written
and
find
it
worth
printing
after
that
all
the
rest
would
come
of
itself
meanwhile
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
and
when
the
girl
had
passed
her
twentieth
year
she
began
to
grow
impatient
she
wondered
why
success
did
not
come
her
way
perhaps
she
lacked
knowledge
she
probably
needed
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
than
the
homestead
in
vermland
and
seeing
that
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
she
could
earn
her
livelihood
as
an
author
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
learn
something
find
some
work
in
life
that
she
might
have
bread
while
she
waited
for
herself
or
maybe
it
was
simply
this
that
the
story
had
lost
patience
with
her
perhaps
it
thought
thus
since
this
blind
person
does
not
see
that
which
lies
nearest
her
eyes
let
her
be
forced
to
go
away
let
her
tramp
upon
gray
stone
streets
let
her
live
in
cramped
city
rooms
with
no
other
outlook
than
gray
stone
walls
let
her
live
among
people
who
hide
everything
that
is
unusual
in
them
and
who
appear
to
be
all
alike
it
may
perchance
teach
her
to
see
that
which
is
waiting
outside
the
gate
of
her
home
all
that
lives
and
moves
between
the
stretch
of
blue
hills
which
she
has
every
day
before
her
eyes
and
so
one
autumn
when
she
was
she
travelled
up
to
stockholm
to
begin
preparing
herself
for
the
vocation
of
teacher
the
girl
soon
became
absorbed
in
her
work
she
wrote
no
more
but
went
in
for
studies
and
lectures
it
actually
looked
as
though
the
story
would
lose
her
altogether
then
something
extraordinary
happened
this
same
autumn
after
she
had
been
living
a
couple
of
months
amidst
gray
streets
and
house
walls
she
was
walking
one
day
up
malmskillnad
street
with
a
bundle
of
books
under
her
arm
she
had
just
come
from
a
lecture
on
the
history
of
literature
the
lecture
must
have
been
about
bellman
and
runeberg
because
she
was
thinking
of
them
and
of
the
characters
that
live
in
their
verses
she
said
to
herself
that
runeberg
jolly
warriors
and
roisterers
were
the
very
best
material
a
writer
could
have
to
work
with
and
suddenly
this
thought
flashed
upon
her
vermland
the
world
in
which
you
have
been
living
is
not
less
remarkable
than
that
of
fredman
or
fänrik
stål
if
you
can
only
learn
how
to
handle
it
you
will
find
that
your
material
is
quite
as
good
as
theirs
this
is
how
it
happened
that
she
caught
her
first
glimpse
of
the
story
and
the
instant
she
saw
it
the
ground
under
her
seemed
to
sway
the
whole
long
malmskillnad
street
from
hamn
street
hill
to
the
rose
toward
the
skies
and
sank
again
rose
and
sank
she
stood
still
a
long
while
until
the
street
had
settled
itself
she
gazed
with
astonishment
at
the
who
walked
calmly
along
apparently
oblivious
to
the
miracle
that
had
taken
place
at
that
moment
the
girl
determined
that
she
would
write
the
story
of
vermland
cavaliers
and
never
for
an
instant
did
she
relinquish
the
thought
of
it
but
many
and
long
years
elapsed
before
the
determination
was
carried
out
in
the
first
place
she
had
entered
upon
a
new
field
of
labor
and
she
lacked
the
time
needful
for
the
carrying
out
of
a
great
literary
work
in
the
second
place
she
had
failed
utterly
in
her
first
attempts
to
write
the
story
during
these
years
many
things
were
constantly
happening
which
helped
mould
it
one
morning
on
a
school
holiday
she
was
sitting
at
the
with
her
father
and
the
two
of
them
talked
of
old
times
then
he
began
telling
of
an
acquaintance
of
his
youth
whom
he
described
as
the
most
fascinating
of
men
this
man
brought
joy
and
cheer
with
him
wherever
he
went
he
could
sing
he
composed
music
he
improvised
verse
if
he
struck
up
a
dance
it
was
not
alone
the
young
folk
who
danced
but
old
men
and
old
women
high
and
low
if
he
made
a
speech
one
had
to
laugh
or
cry
whichever
he
wished
if
he
drank
himself
full
he
could
play
and
talk
better
than
when
he
was
sober
and
when
he
fell
in
love
with
a
woman
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
resist
him
if
he
did
foolish
things
one
forgave
him
if
he
was
sad
at
times
one
wanted
to
do
anything
and
everything
to
see
him
glad
again
but
any
great
success
in
life
he
had
never
had
despite
his
wealth
of
talents
he
had
lived
mostly
at
the
foundries
in
vermland
as
private
tutor
finally
he
was
ordained
as
a
minister
this
was
the
highest
that
he
had
attained
after
this
conversation
she
could
see
the
hero
of
her
story
better
than
heretofore
and
with
this
a
little
life
and
action
came
into
it
one
fine
day
a
name
was
given
to
the
hero
and
he
was
called
gösta
berling
whence
he
got
the
name
she
never
knew
it
was
as
if
he
had
named
himself
another
time
she
came
home
to
spend
the
christmas
holidays
one
evening
the
whole
family
went
off
to
a
christmas
party
a
good
distance
from
home
in
a
terrible
blizzard
it
turned
out
to
be
a
longer
drive
than
one
would
have
thought
the
horse
ploughed
his
way
ahead
at
a
walking
pace
for
several
hours
she
sat
there
in
the
sleigh
in
the
blinding
snowstorm
and
thought
of
the
story
when
they
arrived
finally
she
had
thought
out
her
first
chapter
it
was
the
one
about
the
christmas
night
at
the
smithy
what
a
chapter
it
was
her
first
and
for
many
years
her
only
one
it
was
first
written
in
verse
for
the
original
plan
was
that
it
should
be
a
romance
cycle
like
fänrik
stål
sagas
but
by
degrees
this
was
changed
and
for
a
time
the
idea
was
that
it
should
be
written
as
drama
then
the
christmas
night
was
worked
over
to
go
in
as
the
first
act
but
this
attempt
did
not
succeed
either
at
last
she
decided
to
write
the
story
as
a
novel
then
the
chapter
was
written
in
prose
it
grew
enormously
long
covering
forty
written
pages
the
last
time
it
was
rewritten
it
took
up
only
nine
after
a
few
more
years
came
a
second
chapter
it
was
the
story
of
the
ball
at
borg
and
of
the
wolves
that
hunted
gösta
berling
and
anna
stjernhök
in
the
beginning
this
chapter
was
not
written
with
the
thought
that
it
could
come
into
the
story
but
as
a
sort
of
chance
composition
to
be
read
at
a
small
social
gathering
the
reading
however
was
postponed
and
the
novelette
was
sent
to
after
a
time
the
story
was
returned
as
unavailable
for
the
magazine
it
was
in
reality
not
available
anywhere
as
yet
it
was
altogether
lacking
in
artistic
smoothness
meanwhile
the
author
wondered
to
what
purpose
this
unluckily
born
novelette
could
be
turned
should
she
put
it
into
the
story
to
be
sure
it
was
an
adventure
by
itself
and
ended
it
would
look
odd
among
the
rest
which
were
better
connected
perhaps
it
would
be
such
a
bad
idea
she
thought
then
if
all
the
chapters
of
the
story
were
like
this
one
almost
finished
adventures
this
would
be
difficult
to
carry
out
but
it
might
possibly
be
done
there
would
doubtless
be
gaps
in
the
continuity
here
and
there
but
that
should
give
to
the
book
great
strength
and
variety
now
two
important
matters
were
settled
the
story
was
to
be
a
novel
and
each
chapter
should
be
complete
in
itself
but
nothing
much
had
been
gained
hereby
she
who
had
been
fired
with
the
idea
of
writing
the
story
of
vermland
cavaliers
when
she
was
at
this
stage
was
nearing
the
thirties
and
had
not
been
able
to
write
more
than
two
chapters
where
had
the
years
gone
she
had
been
graduated
from
the
teachers
college
and
for
several
years
past
had
been
a
teacher
at
landskrona
she
had
become
interested
in
much
and
had
been
occupied
with
many
things
but
the
story
was
just
as
unwritten
a
mass
of
material
had
certainly
been
collected
but
why
was
it
so
hard
for
her
to
write
it
down
why
did
the
inspiration
never
come
to
her
why
did
the
pen
glide
so
slowly
over
the
paper
she
certainly
had
her
dark
moments
at
that
time
she
began
to
think
that
she
never
would
finish
her
novel
she
was
that
servant
who
buried
his
talent
in
the
ground
and
never
tried
to
use
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
this
occurred
during
the
eighties
when
stern
realism
was
at
its
height
she
admired
the
great
masters
of
that
time
never
thinking
that
one
could
use
any
other
style
in
writing
than
the
one
they
employed
for
her
own
part
she
liked
the
romanticists
better
but
romanticism
was
dead
and
she
was
hardly
the
one
to
think
of
reviving
its
form
and
expression
although
her
brain
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
stories
of
ghosts
and
mad
love
of
wondrously
beautiful
women
and
cavaliers
she
tried
to
write
about
it
in
calm
realistic
prose
she
was
not
very
another
would
have
seen
that
the
impossible
was
impossible
once
she
wrote
a
couple
of
chapters
in
another
style
one
was
a
scene
from
svartsjö
churchyard
the
other
was
about
the
old
philosopher
uncle
eberhard
and
his
infidel
manuscripts
she
scribbled
them
mostly
in
fun
with
many
ohs
and
ahs
in
the
prose
which
made
it
almost
rhythmical
she
perceived
that
in
this
vein
she
could
write
there
was
inspiration
in
this
she
could
feel
it
but
when
the
two
short
chapters
were
finished
she
laid
them
aside
they
were
only
written
in
fun
one
could
not
write
a
whole
book
in
that
vein
but
now
the
story
had
been
waiting
long
enough
it
thought
no
doubt
as
it
did
at
the
time
when
it
sent
her
out
in
the
world
again
i
must
send
this
blinded
person
a
great
longing
which
will
open
her
eyes
the
longing
came
over
her
in
this
manner
the
homestead
where
she
had
grown
up
was
sold
she
journeyed
to
the
home
of
her
childhood
to
see
it
once
again
before
strangers
should
occupy
it
the
evening
before
she
left
there
perhaps
nevermore
to
see
the
dear
old
place
she
concluded
in
all
meekness
and
humility
to
write
the
book
in
her
own
way
and
according
to
her
own
poor
abilities
it
was
not
going
to
be
any
great
masterwork
as
she
had
hoped
it
might
be
a
book
at
which
people
would
laugh
but
anyway
she
would
write
it
write
it
for
herself
to
save
for
herself
what
she
could
still
save
of
the
home
the
dear
old
stories
the
sweet
peace
of
the
days
and
the
beautiful
landscape
with
the
long
lakes
and
the
blue
hills
but
for
her
who
had
hoped
that
she
might
yet
learn
to
write
a
book
people
would
care
to
read
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
relinquished
the
very
thing
in
life
she
had
been
most
eager
to
win
it
was
the
hardest
sacrifice
she
had
made
thus
far
a
few
weeks
later
she
was
again
at
her
home
in
landskrona
seated
at
her
she
began
writing
she
did
know
exactly
what
it
was
to
be
but
she
was
not
going
to
be
afraid
of
the
strong
words
the
exclamations
the
interrogations
nor
would
she
be
afraid
to
give
herself
with
all
her
childishness
and
all
her
dreams
after
she
had
come
to
this
decision
the
pen
began
to
move
almost
by
itself
this
made
her
quite
delirious
she
was
carried
away
with
enthusiasm
ah
this
was
writing
unfamiliar
thoughts
and
things
or
rather
things
she
never
had
surmised
were
stored
away
in
her
brain
crowded
down
upon
the
paper
the
pages
were
filled
with
a
haste
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
what
had
hitherto
required
months
no
years
to
work
out
was
now
accomplished
in
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening
she
wrote
the
story
of
the
young
countess
tramp
over
the
ice
on
river
löven
and
the
flood
at
ekeby
the
following
afternoon
she
wrote
the
scene
in
which
the
gouty
ensign
rutger
von
örneclou
tries
to
raise
himself
in
bed
to
dance
the
cachuca
and
the
evening
of
the
next
day
appeared
the
story
of
the
old
who
went
off
to
visit
the
parsimonious
broby
clergyman
now
she
knew
for
certain
that
in
this
style
she
could
write
the
book
but
she
was
just
as
certain
that
no
one
would
have
the
patience
to
read
it
through
however
not
many
chapters
let
themselves
be
written
like
this
in
one
breath
most
of
them
required
long
and
arduous
labor
and
there
were
only
little
snatches
of
time
in
the
afternoons
which
she
could
devote
to
authorship
when
she
had
been
writing
about
half
a
year
reckoning
from
the
day
when
she
had
gone
in
for
romanticism
with
a
vengeance
about
a
dozen
chapters
were
written
at
this
rate
the
book
would
be
finished
in
three
or
four
years
it
was
in
the
spring
of
this
year
that
invited
prize
competitors
to
send
in
short
novelettes
of
about
one
hundred
printed
pages
this
was
an
outlet
for
a
story
that
wanted
to
be
told
and
sent
into
the
world
it
must
have
been
the
story
itself
that
prompted
her
sister
to
suggest
to
her
that
she
make
use
of
this
opportunity
here
at
last
was
a
way
of
finding
out
if
her
story
was
so
hopelessly
bad
if
it
received
the
prize
much
would
be
gained
if
it
did
she
simply
stood
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
before
she
had
nothing
against
the
idea
but
she
had
so
little
faith
in
herself
that
she
could
come
to
any
conclusion
finally
just
eight
days
before
the
time
for
submitting
manuscripts
had
expired
she
decided
to
take
from
the
novel
five
chapters
which
were
sufficiently
well
connected
to
pass
for
a
novelette
and
chance
it
with
these
but
the
chapters
were
far
from
ready
three
of
them
were
loosely
written
but
of
the
remaining
two
there
was
barely
an
outline
then
the
whole
thing
must
be
legibly
copied
of
course
to
add
to
this
she
was
not
at
home
just
then
but
was
visiting
her
sister
and
who
still
lived
in
vermland
and
one
who
has
come
to
visit
with
dear
friends
for
a
short
time
can
not
spend
the
days
at
a
she
wrote
therefore
at
night
sitting
up
the
whole
week
until
four
in
the
mornings
finally
there
were
only
hours
of
the
precious
time
left
and
there
were
still
twenty
pages
to
be
written
on
this
the
last
day
they
were
invited
out
the
whole
family
were
going
on
a
little
journey
to
be
gone
for
the
night
naturally
she
had
to
accompany
the
rest
when
the
party
was
over
and
the
guests
dispersed
she
sat
up
all
night
writing
in
the
strange
place
at
times
she
felt
very
queer
the
place
where
she
was
visiting
was
the
very
estate
on
which
the
wicked
sintram
had
lived
fate
in
a
singular
way
had
brought
her
there
on
the
very
night
when
she
must
write
about
him
who
sat
in
the
rocker
and
rocked
now
and
then
she
looked
up
from
her
work
and
listened
in
the
direction
of
the
for
the
possible
sound
of
a
pair
of
rockers
in
motion
but
nothing
was
heard
when
the
clock
struck
six
the
next
morning
the
five
chapters
were
finished
along
in
the
forenoon
they
travelled
home
on
a
little
freight
steamer
there
her
sister
did
up
the
parcel
sealed
it
with
which
had
been
brought
from
home
for
this
purpose
wrote
the
address
and
sent
off
the
novelette
this
happened
on
one
of
the
last
days
in
july
toward
the
end
of
august
contained
a
notice
to
the
effect
that
something
over
twenty
manuscripts
had
been
received
by
the
editors
but
that
one
or
two
among
them
were
so
confusedly
written
they
could
not
be
counted
in
then
she
gave
up
waiting
for
results
she
knew
of
course
which
novelette
was
so
confusedly
written
that
it
could
not
be
counted
in
one
afternoon
in
november
she
received
a
curious
telegram
it
contained
simply
the
words
hearty
congratulations
and
was
signed
by
three
of
her
college
classmates
for
her
it
was
a
terribly
long
wait
until
of
the
following
day
when
the
stockholm
papers
were
distributed
when
the
paper
was
in
her
hands
she
had
to
search
long
without
finding
anything
finally
on
the
last
page
she
found
a
little
notice
in
fine
print
which
told
that
the
prize
had
been
awarded
to
her
to
another
it
might
not
have
meant
so
much
perhaps
but
for
her
it
meant
that
she
could
devote
herself
to
the
calling
which
all
her
life
she
had
longed
to
follow
there
is
but
little
to
add
to
this
the
story
that
wanted
to
be
told
and
sent
out
in
the
world
was
now
fairly
near
its
destination
now
it
was
to
be
written
at
least
even
though
it
might
take
a
few
years
more
before
it
was
finished
she
who
was
writing
it
had
gone
up
to
stockholm
around
christmas
time
after
she
had
received
the
prize
the
editor
of
volunteered
to
print
the
book
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
if
she
could
ever
find
time
to
write
it
the
evening
before
she
was
to
return
to
landskrona
she
spent
with
her
loyal
friend
baroness
adlersparre
to
whom
she
read
a
few
chapters
aloud
footnote
baroness
adlersparre
pen
name
esselde
was
a
noted
swedish
writer
publisher
and
philanthropist
and
a
contemporary
of
fredrika
bremer
esselde
listened
as
only
she
could
listen
and
she
became
interested
after
the
reading
she
sat
silently
and
pondered
how
long
will
it
be
before
all
of
it
is
ready
she
asked
finally
three
or
four
years
then
they
parted
the
next
morning
two
hours
before
she
was
to
leave
stockholm
a
message
came
from
esselde
bidding
her
come
to
her
before
the
departure
the
old
baroness
was
in
her
most
positive
and
determined
mood
now
you
must
take
a
leave
of
absence
for
a
year
and
finish
the
book
i
shall
procure
the
money
fifteen
minutes
later
the
girl
was
on
her
way
to
the
principal
of
the
teachers
college
to
ask
her
assistance
in
securing
a
substitute
at
one
she
was
happily
seated
in
the
railway
carriage
but
now
she
was
going
no
farther
than
sörmland
where
she
had
good
friends
who
lived
in
a
charming
villa
and
so
they
otto
gumaelius
and
his
wife
gave
her
the
freedom
of
their
home
freedom
to
work
and
peace
and
the
best
of
care
for
nearly
a
year
until
the
book
was
finished
now
at
last
she
could
write
from
morning
till
night
it
was
the
happiest
time
of
her
life
but
when
the
story
was
finished
at
the
close
of
the
summer
it
looked
queer
it
was
wild
and
disordered
and
the
connecting
threads
were
so
loose
that
all
the
parts
seemed
bent
upon
following
their
old
inclination
to
wander
off
each
in
its
own
way
it
never
became
what
it
should
have
been
its
misfortune
was
that
it
had
been
compelled
to
wait
so
long
to
be
told
if
it
was
not
properly
disciplined
and
restrained
it
was
mostly
because
the
author
was
so
overjoyed
in
the
thought
that
at
last
she
had
been
privileged
to
write
it
