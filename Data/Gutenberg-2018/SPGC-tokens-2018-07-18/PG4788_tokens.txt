friends
among
the
literary
celebrities
of
his
day

a
paternal
affection
for

at
he

taine
and
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
flaubert

to
act
as
his
literary
godfather
his
friendship
with
the
goucourts
was
of
short
duration
his
frank
and
practical
nature
reacted
against
the
ambiance
of
gossip
scandal
duplicity
and
invidious
criticism
that
the
two
brothers
had
created
around
them
in
the
guise
of
an
eighteenth
century
style
salon
he
hated
the
human
comedy
the
social
farce
in
his
latter
years
he
developed
an
exaggerated
love
for
solitude
a
predilection
for
and
still
worse
a
constant
fear
of
death
and
mania
of
persecution
which
ran
like
a
black
thread
through
all
his
writings
and
brought
on
gradually
the
final
tragic
he
became
insane
in
and
died
in
without
having
recovered
his
mind
life
movement
penetrating
observation
and
hypersensitiveness
both
artistic
and
physical
are
the
dominant
traits
of
this
literary
phenomenon
his
rise
to
fame
was
as
vertiginous
as
his
fall
and
decay
as
a
novelist
he
may
have
his
equals
and
superiors
but
as
a
short
with
the
exception
of
charles
nodier
and
alphonse
daudet
he
had
the
happy
hour

note
from
brett
the
original

but
i
could
not
find

it
was
a
typographical
error
mademoiselle
fifi
the
prussian
commander
major
graf
von
farlsberg
was
finishing
the
reading
of
his
mail
comfortably
seated
in
a
large
tapestry
armchair
with
his
booted
feet
resting
on
the
elegant
marble
of
the
mantelpiece
on
which
for
the
last
three
months
that
he
had
been
occupying
the
chateau
his
spurs
had
traced
two
deep
grooves
growing
deeper
every
day
a
cup
of
coffee
was
steaming
on
an
inlaid
guerdon
stained
with
liqueur
burned
by
cigars
notched
by
the
penknife
of
the
conquering
officer
who
while
sharpening
his
pencil
would
stop
at
times
and
trace
on
the
marble
monograms
or
designs
according
to
the
fancy
of
his
indolent
dream
after
he
had
finished
his
letters
and
read
the
german
newspapers
which
his
orderly
had
brought
him
he
rose
threw
into
the
fire
three
or
four
enormous
pieces
of
green
wood
for
these
gentlemen
were
cutting
down
little
by
little
the
trees
of
the
park
to
keep
themselves
warm
and
stepped
over
to
the
window
the
rain
was
pouring
a
regular
normandy
rain
which
one
might
have
thought
was
let
loose
and
showered
down
by
a
furious
hand
a
slanting
rain
thick
like
a
curtain
forming
a
kind
of
wall
with
oblique
stripes
a
rain
that
lashed
splashed
deluged
everything
a
rain
peculiar
to
the
neighborhood
of
rouen
that
watering
pot
of
france
the
officer
looked
for
a
long
while
at
the
inundated
lawn
and
yonder
the
swollen
andilles
which
was
overflowing
and
with
his
fingers
he
was
drumming
on
the
a
waltz
from
the
rhineland
when
a
noise
caused
him
to
turn
around
it
was
his
second
in
command
baron
von
kelweingstein
holding
a
rank
equivalent
to
that
of
captain
the
major
was
a
giant
with
broad
shoulders
graced
by
a
blond
beard
flowing
down
his
chest
and
forming
a
his
whole
tall
solemn
person
suggested
the
image
of
a
military
peacock
a
peacock
that
would
carry
its
tail
spread
on
its
chin
he
had
blue
eyes
cold
and
gentle
a
cheek
bearing
the
scar
of
a
sword
wound
inflicted
during
the
austrian
war
and
he
was
said
to
be
a
kind
hearted
man
as
well
as
a
brave
officer
short
red
faced
corpulent
tightly
belted
the
captain
wore
cropped
almost
close
his
red
hair
the
fiery
filaments
of
which
when
under
the
reflection
of
certain
lights
might
have
given
the
impression
as
though
his
face
had
been
rubbed
with
phosphorus
two
teeth
lost
in
a
night
orgy
and
brawl
he
did
not
exactly
remember
now
caused
him
to
spit
out
indistinct
words
which
one
could
not
always
understand
he
was
bald
only
on
the
top
of
his
head
like
a
tonsured
monk
with
a
crop
of
short
curly
hair
golden
and
shiny
around
this
circle
of
bare
flesh
the
commander
shook
hands
and
gulped
down
his
cup
of
coffee
the
sixth
since
that
morning
while
listening
to
the
report
of
his
subordinate
about
the
incidents
and
happening
in
the
service
then
both
came
back
near
the
window
and
declared
that
theirs
was
not
a
cheerful
lot
the
major
a
quiet
man
married
and
having
left
his
wife
home
would
adapt
himself
to
anything
but
the
baron
captain
accustomed
to
leading
a
fast
life
a
patron
of
low
resorts
a
wild
chaser
of
disreputable
women
was
furious
at
having
been
confined
for
the
last
three
months
to
the
obligatory
chasteness
of
this
out
of
the
way
post
presently
they
heard
a
scratching
on
the
door
the
commander
said
come
in
and
a
man
one
of
their
automaton
soldiers
appeared
in
the
aperture
announcing
by
his
mere
presence
that
luncheon
was
served
in
the
they
found
three
officers
of
lower
rank
one
lieutenant
otto
von
grossling
and
two
fritz
scheuneberg
and
markgraf
wilhelm
von
eyrik
a
tiny
blond
man
haughty
and
brutal
with
his
men
harsh
toward
the
vanquished
foe
and
violent
like
a
since
his
arrival
in
france
his
comrade
called
him
only
mademoiselle
fifi
this
nickname
was
bestowed
upon
him
on
account
of
his
coquettish
style
of
dressing
and
manners
his
slender
waist
which
looked
as
if
it
were
laced
in
a
corset
his
pale
face
on
which
a
nascent
mustache
could
hardly
be
seen
and
also
on
account
of
the
habit
he
had
acquired
in
order
to
express
his
supreme
contempt
for
persons
and
things
of
using
continually
the
french
locution
fi
fi
donc
which
he
pronounced
with
a
slight
lisping
the
of
the
chateau
was
a
large
and
regal
hall
the
ancient
mirrors
of
which
constellated
with
bullet
holes
and
the
high
flanders
tapestries
slashed
with
sword
cuts
and
hanging
in
shreds
at
certain
places
told
the
tale
of
mademoiselle
favorite
occupations
and
pastime
during
his
hours
of
idleness
on
the
walls
three
family
portraits
a
warrior
wearing
his
armor
a
cardinal
and
a
chief
justice
were
smoking
long
porcelain
pipes
while
in
its
frame
ungilt
by
age
a
noble
lady
in
a
tight
waist
was
showing
with
an
arrogant
air
an
enormous
pair
of
mustache
crayoned
with
charcoal
and
the
officers
luncheon
went
off
almost
silently
in
this
mutilated
room
darkened
by
the
shower
outside
sad
and
depressing
in
its
vanquished
appearance
the
old
oak
parquet
floor
of
which
had
become
solid
like
the
floor
of
a
bar
room
having
finished
eating
it
was
time
for
smoking
they
began
to
drink
and
reverting
to
their
usual
topic
they
spoke
of
their
monotonous
and
tedious
life
bottles
of
cognac
and
liqueur
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
seating
back
on
their
chairs
they
were
all
absorbing
their
liqueur
in
repeated
sips
holding
at
the
corner
of
their
mouths
the
long
curved
pipes
ending
in
a
meerschaum
bowl
invariably
daubed
as
if
to
seduce
hottentots
as
soon
as
their
glasses
were
empty
they
refilled
them
with
a
gesture
of
resigned
weariness
but
mademoiselle
fifi
broke
his
glass
every
instant
and
then
a
soldier
brought
him
immediately
a
new
one
a
mist
of
acrid
smoke
bathed
drowned
them
and
they
seemed
to
sink
into
a
somnolent
and
sad
inebriety
in
that
taciturn
and
morose
intoxication
peculiar
to
men
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
suddenly
the
baron
sat
up
a
revolt
shook
him
he
swore
by
heavens
this
can
not
go
on
indefinitely
we
must
in
the
end
invent
something
lieutenant
otto
and
fritz
two
teutons
eminently
endowed
with
heavy
and
serious
german
faces
replied
together
what
shall
we
invent
captain
he
mused
for
a
few
seconds
and
resumed
what
well
we
must
organize
an
entertainment
if
the
commander
will
permit
the
major
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
what
entertainment
captain
the
baron
came
nearer
leave
it
to
me
commander
i
shall
send
pflicht
to
rouen
and
he
will
bring
us
some
women
i
know
where
to
get
them
a
supper
will
be
prepared
here
besides
we
have
everything
and
i
may
venture
to
say
we
shall
spend
a
rather
pleasant
evening
duty
graf
farlsberg
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
you
are
crazy
my
friend
but
all
the
officers
had
risen
surrounding
their
chief
and
beseeching
him
let
the
captain
go
commander
it
is
so
sad
here
finally
the
major
yielded
all
right
said
he
and
immediately
the
baron
sent
for
pflicht
pflicht
was
an
old
officer
who
had
never
been
seen
smiling
but
who
carried
out
with
fanatical
punctuality
the
orders
of
his
superiors
no
matter
what
they
were
erect
with
his
impassive
face
he
received
the
baron
instructions
then
he
left
the
room
and
five
minutes
later
a
large
military
wagon
covered
with
miller
tarpaulin
stretched
in
the
shape
of
a
dome
was
being
rapidly
driven
away
under
the
heavy
rain
at
the
gallop
of
four
horses
at
once
an
awakening
thrill
seemed
to
run
through
the
group
of
officers
and
shook
them
from
their
lethargy
the
languid
poses
straightened
up
faces
became
animated
and
they
began
to
talk
although
the
shower
was
continuing
as
heavy
as
ever
the
major
affirmed
that
it
was
not
so
dark
and
lieutenant
otto
announced
positively
that
the
weather
was
clearing
up
even
mademoiselle
fifi
seemed
unable
to
keep
still
he
rose
and
sat
down
again
his
harsh
and
clear
eye
was
looking
for
something
to
break
suddenly
glaring
at
the
lady
with
the
mustache
the
young
prig
drew
his
revolver
you
shall
not
witness
it
you
said
he
and
without
leaving
his
seat
he
aimed
two
bullets
fired
in
rapid
succession
put
out
the
eyes
of
the
portrait
then
he
exclaimed
let
us
explode
a
mine
and
at
once
the
conversation
was
interrupted
as
if
a
powerful
and
new
curiosity
had
taken
hold
of
every
one
present
a
mine
that
was
his
invention
his
way
of
destroying
his
favorite
amusement
when
he
hurriedly
left
his
chateau
comte
fernand
the
legitimate
owner
had
had
no
time
to
take
with
him
nor
hide
away
anything
except
the
which
he
had
stowed
away
in
a
hole
made
in
a
wall
now
as
he
was
immensely
wealthy
and
lived
in
great
luxury
his
large
salon
the
door
of
which
communicated
with
the
presented
the
appearance
of
a
picture
gallery
before
the
precipitate
flight
of
the
master
priceless
paintings
and
aquarelles
were
hanging
on
the
walls
while
on
the
tables
the
étagères
and
the
elegant
cabinets
thousands
of
bric
à
brac
and
bibelots
statuettes
dresden
and
chinese
vases
old
ivories
and
venice
pottery
peopled
the
large
room
with
their
precious
and
odd
multitude
hardly
any
were
left
by
this
time
not
that
they
had
been
stolen
the
major
graf
farlsberg
would
not
have
permitted
nor
tolerated
it
but
mademoiselle
fifi
once
in
a
while
exploded
a
mine
and
on
such
occasions
all
the
officers
enjoyed
themselves
thoroughly
for
five
minutes
the
little
markgraf
went
to
the
salon
to
fetch
what
he
needed
he
brought
in
a
tiny
and
graceful
chinese
of
the
rose
family
which
he
filled
with
gun
powder
and
through
the
neck
of
which
he
carefully
introduced
a
long
piece
of
tinder
lighted
it
and
running
carried
this
infernal
machine
into
the
next
room
then
he
returned
quickly
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
all
the
germans
stood
up
and
waited
their
faces
wreathed
in
childlike
smiles
of
curiosity
and
as
soon
as
the
explosion
shook
the
chateau
they
hurried
in
all
at
once
mademoiselle
fifi
who
had
been
the
first
one
to
rush
in
was
deliriously
clapping
his
hands
in
front
of
a
terra
cotta
venus
whose
head
at
last
had
been
blown
off
and
each
picked
up
broken
pieces
of
china
wondering
at
the
strange
indentation
of
the
fragments
examining
the
new
damage
done
claiming
that
some
of
the
damage
had
been
caused
by
previous
explosions
and
the
major
was
contemplating
with
a
paternal
look
the
large
salon
upset
by
this
neronian
firework
and
strewn
with
the
debris
of
the

he
came
out
first
declaring
naturedly
it
was
very
successful
this
time
but
such
a
spout
of
smoke
had
invaded
the
mixing
with
the
smoke
of
tobacco
that
it
was
impossible
to
breathe
the
commander
opened
the
window
and
all
the
officers
who
had
come
back
to
drink
a
last
glass
of
cognac
crowded
near
it
the
damp
air
blew
into
the
room
bringing
in
a
kind
of
water
dust
which
sprayed
and
powdered
the
beards
and
a
smell
of
inundation
they
were
looking
at
the
tall
trees
bending
under
the
shower
the
broad
valley
darkened
by
this
outflow
of
the
black
low
clouds
and
in
the
distance
the
church
spire
rising
like
a
gray
point
in
the
pelting
rain
note
from
brett
the
original
uses
clowds
but
i
think
clouds
was
intended
since
the
arrival
of
the
germans
the
church
bell
had
not
rung
it
was
in
fact
the
only
resistance
with
which
the
invaders
met
in
that
neighborhood
the
resistance
of
the
the
curate
had
not
refused
to
receive
and
feed
prussian
soldiers
he
had
even
on
several
occasions
accepted
to
drink
a
bottle
of
beer
or
claret
with
the
enemy
commander
who
often
used
him
as
a
benevolent
intermediary
but
it
was
useless
to
ask
him
for
a
single
ring
of
his
bell
he
would
rather
have
faced
a
firing
squad
that
was
his
way
of
protesting
against
invasion
a
peaceful
protest
the
protest
of
silence
the
only
one
said
he
that
became
a
priest
a
man
of
peace
and
not
of
blood
and
everybody
for
ten
miles
around
praised
the
firmness
the
heroism
of
father
chantavoine
who
dared
to
affirm
the
public
mourning
and
proclaim
it
by
the
obstinate
mutism
of
his
church
the
entire
village
enthusiastic
about
this
resistance
was
ready
to
support
and
back
up
its
pastor
to
the
bitter
end
to
risk
anything
considering
this
tacit
protest
as
a
safeguard
of
the
national
honor
it
seemed
to
the
peasants
that
in
this
way
they
deserved
better
of
their
country
than
belfort
or
strasbourg
that
they
had
given
just
as
good
an
example
that
the
name
of
their
hamlet
would
remain
immortal
for
it
and
with
that
single
exception
they
refused
nothing
to
the
victorious
prussians
the
commander
and
his
officers
laughed
in
private
at
this
manifestation
of
inoffensive
courage
and
as
the
entire
neighborhood
showed
themselves
obliging
to
them
and
docile
to
their
orders
they
willingly
tolerated
the
priest
silent
patriotism
little
markgraf
wilhelm
was
the
only
one
who
would
have
liked
to
compel
the
bell
to
ring
he
was
very
indignant
at
the
political
condescendence
of
his
superior
officer
towards
the
priest
and
every
day
he
was
beseeching
the
commander
to
let
him
do
once
just
once
merely
for
the
sake
of
having
a
little
fun
and
he
begged
for
it
with
feline
gracefulness
the
cajolery
of
a
woman
the
tenderness
of
voice
of
a
beloved
mistress
craving
for
something
but
the
commander
did
not
yield
and
to
console
himself
mademoiselle
fifi
exploded
mines
in
the
chateau
the
five
men
remained
there
in
a
group
for
a
few
minutes
inhaling
the
damp
air
finally
lieutenant
fritz
spoke
with
a
thick
laugh
decidedly
the
ladies
will
not
have
fine
weather
for
their
trip
thereupon
they
separated
each
going
to
his
work
the
captain
having
a
great
deal
to
do
to
make
arrangements
for
the
dinner
party
when
they
met
again
at
nightfall
they
began
to
laugh
at
seeing
each
other
dolled
up
coquettishly
and
smart
like
on
grand
review
days
perfumed
pomaded
and
hale
the
commander
hair
seemed
less
gray
than
in
the
morning
and
the
captain
had
shaved
keeping
only
his
mustache
which
looked
like
a
flame
under
his
nose
notwithstanding
the
rain
the
window
was
kept
open
and
from
time
to
time
one
of
them
went
over
to
listen
at
ten
minutes
past
six
the
baron
reported
a
distant
rolling
they
all
hurried
downstairs
and
soon
the
large
carriage
came
up
with
the
four
horses
still
galloping
covered
with
mud
up
to
their
backs
steaming
and
blowing
and
five
women
got
off
the
carriage
and
stepped
on
the
perron
five
graceful
girls
carefully
selected
by
a
chum
of
the
captain
to
whom
pflicht
had
taken
a
card
from
his
officer
they
had
not
been
reluctant
to
come
knowing
that
they
would
be
well
paid
besides
they
were
quite
well
acquainted
and
familiar
with
the
prussians
having
been
in
intercourse
with
them
for
the
past
three
months
and
making
the
best
of
men
as
of
things
our
business
requires
it
they
told
each
other
on
their
way
no
doubt
in
order
to
ease
off
some
secret
pricking
of
a
remnant
of
conscience
and
presently
they
were
ushered
into
the
lighted
up
the
looked
still
more
lugubrious
in
its
pitiful
dilapidation
and
the
table
covered
with
viands
rich
china
and
silver
plate
which
had
been
discovered
in
the
wall
where
the
owner
had
hidden
them
gave
to
the
premises
the
appearance
of
a
low
tavern
where
bandits
are
having
supper
after
a
successful
raffle
the
captain
radiant
took
hold
of
the
women
as
of
a
familiar
thing
appreciating
them
embracing
them
scenting
them
estimating
them
at
their
value
as
instruments
of
pleasure
and
as
the
three
younger
men
wanted
to
take
one
each
he
objected
to
it
with
authority
reserving
to
himself
the
privilege
of
making
the
assignments
in
perfect
fairness
according
to
rank
so
as
not
to
injure
in
any
way
the
hierarchy
then
in
order
to
preclude
any
discussion
any
contest
and
any
suspicion
of
partiality
he
lined
them
up
according
to
height
and
addressing
the
tallest
in
a
tone
of
command
your
name
she
replied
raising
her
voice
pamela
then
he
announced
number
one
by
the
name
of
pamela
is
adjudged
to
the
commander
having
then
kissed
blondine
the
second
as
a
mark
of
his
claim
to
ownership
he
offered
the
fat
amanda
to
lieutenant
otto
eva
la
tomate
to
fritz
and
the
smallest
of
all
rachel
a
very
young
brunette
with
black
eyes
like
ink
spots
a
jewess
whose
pug
nose
confirmed
the
rule
that
ascribes
hooked
noses
to
all
her
race
to
the
youngest
officer
the
frail
markgraf
wilhelm
von
eyrik
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
all
pretty
and
plump
without
any
distinctive
character
on
their
faces
shaped
almost
alike
in
appearance
and
style
and
complexion
by
the
daily
practice
of
their
illicit
trade
and
the
life
in
common
in
disreputable
houses
the
three
young
men
wanted
immediately
to
take
their
partners
out
of
the
room
under
pretext
of
offering
them
brushes
and
soap
for
washing
and
freshening
up
but
the
captain
was
wise
enough
not
to
allow
it
claiming
that
they
were
clean
enough
to
sit
down
to
dinner
and
for
fear
that
those
who
went
up
might
want
to
change
their
girls
when
they
came
down
and
thus
disturb
the
other
couples
his
experience
prevailed
there
were
only
plenty
of
kisses
kisses
of
expectancy
suddenly
rachel
suffocated
coughing
to
tears
and
rejecting
smoke
through
her
nose
the
markgraf
feigning
to
kiss
her
had
blown
a
whiff
of
tobacco
into
her
mouth
she
did
not
get
angry
did
not
utter
a
single
word
but
glared
at
her
possessor
with
anger
aroused
way
down
at
the
bottom
of
her
black
eyes
they
sat
down
to
dinner
the
commander
himself
seemed
to
be
delighted
he
took
pamela
on
his
right
and
blondine
on
his
left
and
while
unfolding
his
napkin
he
declared
this
was
a
charming
idea
of
yours
captain
lieutenants
otto
and
fritz
polite
and
obsequious
as
if
they
were
sitting
near
society
ladies
did
slightly
intimidate
their
neighbors
but
baron
von
kelweingstein
let
loose
in
his
vice
was
beaming
he
cracked
unsavory
jokes
and
with
his
crown
of
red
hair
seemed
to
be
on
fire
he
paid
gallant
compliments
in
his
defective
french
of
the
rhine
and
his
lewd
nonsense
smacking
of
taverns
expectorated
through
the
hole
between
his
two
broken
teeth
reached
the
girls
in
the
middle
of
a
rapid
fire
of
saliva
the
girls
did
not
understand
his
witticisms
and
their
intelligence
did
not
seem
to
be
awakened
until
he
sputtered
obscene
words
rough
expressions
crippled
by
his
accent
then
all
in
a
chorus
began
to
laugh
as
if
they
were
demented
falling
on
the
laps
of
their
neighbors
repeating
the
words
which
the
baron
disfigured
purposely
in
order
to
make
them
say
filthy
things
they
vomited
at
will
plenty
of
them
intoxicated
after
drinking
from
the
first
bottles
of
wine
and
relapsing
into
their
real
selves
opening
the
gates
to
their
habits
they
kissed
mustaches
on
their
right
and
those
on
their
left
pinched
arms
uttered
furious
screams
drank
out
of
all
the
glasses
sang
french
couplets
and
bits
of
german
songs
they
had
learned
in
their
daily
intercourse
with
the
enemy
soon
the
men
themselves
flushed
and
excited
by
the
female
flesh
spread
under
their
nose
and
within
reach
of
their
hands
lost
all
restraint
roaring
breaking
the
plates
while
behind
them
impassive
soldiers
were
waiting
the
commander
only
kept
some
restraint
mademoiselle
fifi
had
taken
rachel
on
his
knees
and
deliberately
working
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
frenzy
kissed
madly
the
ebony
curls
on
her
neck
inhaling
through
the
thin
interstice
between
the
gown
and
her
skin
the
sweet
warmth
of
her
body
and
the
full
fragrance
of
her
person
through
the
silk
he
pinched
her
furiously
making
her
scream
seized
with
a
rabid
ferocity
and
distracted
by
his
craving
for
destruction
often
also
holding
her
in
his
arms
squeezing
her
as
if
he
wanted
to
mix
her
with
himself
he
pressed
long
kisses
on
the
fresh
lips
of
the
jewess
and
embraced
her
until
he
lost
breath
but
suddenly
he
bit
her
so
deep
that
a
dash
of
blood
flowed
down
the
chin
of
the
young
girl
and
ran
into
her
waist
once
more
she
looked
at
him
straight
in
the
face
and
washing
the
wound
she
muttered
you
will
have
to
pay
for
it
he
began
to
laugh
with
a
harsh
laugh
all
right
i
shall
pay
said
he
at
dessert
champagne
was
served
the
commander
rose
and
with
the
same
tone
as
he
would
have
taken
to
drink
the
health
of
the
empress
augusta
he
said
to
our
ladies
and
a
series
of
toasts
were
then
drunk
toasts
with
the
gallantry
and
manner
of
drunkards
and
troopers
mixed
with
obscene
jokes
rendered
still
more
brutal
by
their
ignorance
of
the
language
they
were
rising
one
after
the
other
trying
to
be
witty
making
efforts
to
be
funny
and
the
women
so
intoxicated
that
they
were
hardly
able
to
sit
up
with
their
vacant
look
their
heavy
clammy
tongues
applauded
vociferously
each
time
the
captain
no
doubt
intending
to
lend
the
orgy
an
atmosphere
of
gallantry
raised
once
more
his
glass
and
pronounced
to
our
victories
over
the
hearts
then
lieutenant
otto
a
kind
of
bear
from
the
black
forest
jumped
up
inflamed
saturated
with
drinks
and
suddenly
carried
away
by
alcoholic
patriotism
he
cried
to
our
victories
over
france
intoxicated
as
they
were
the
women
kept
silent
and
rachel
shuddering
with
rage
retorted
well
i
know
some
frenchmen
in
whose
presence
you
would
not
dare
say
such
things
but
the
little
markgraf
still
holding
her
on
his
knees
began
to
laugh
having
become
exceedingly
exhilarated
by
the
wine
ah
ah
ah
i
never
met
any
myself
as
soon
as
they
see
us
they
run
away
the
girl
exasperated
shouted
in
his
face
you
lie
you
dirty
pig
for
a
second
he
fixed
on
her
his
clear
eyes
as
he
used
to
fix
them
on
the
paintings
the
canvas
of
which
he
riddled
with
revolver
shots
then
he
laughed
oh
yes
let
us
speak
of
it
you
beauty
would
we
be
here
if
they
were
brave
and
he
became
more
and
more
excited
we
are
their
masters
france
belongs
to
us
she
sprang
off
his
knees
and
fell
back
on
her
chair
he
rose
held
out
his
glass
over
the
table
and
repeated
france
the
french
their
fields
their
woods
and
their
houses
belong
to
us
the
others
who
were
thoroughly
intoxicated
suddenly
shaken
by
military
enthusiasm
the
enthusiasm
of
brutes
seized
their
glasses
and
shouted
vociferously
long
live
prussia
and
emptied
them
at
a
draught
the
girls
did
not
protest
reduced
to
silence
and
frightened
even
rachel
kept
silent
unable
to
reply
then
the
little
markgraf
placed
on
the
head
of
the
jewess
his
glass
of
champaign
refilled
and
said
the
women
of
france
belong
to
us
she
jumped
up
so
quickly
that
the
glass
was
upset
and
spilled
the
yellow
wine
in
her
black
hair
as
for
a
baptism
it
fell
broken
to
pieces
on
the
floor
her
lips
quivering
she
looked
defiantly
at
the
officer
the
latter
kept
laughing
she
stammered
in
a
voice
choked
with
rage
that
that
is
not
true
you
shall
never
have
the
women
of
france
he
sat
down
to
laugh
at
his
ease
and
tried
to
imitate
the
parisian
accent
that
is
a
good
one
that
is
a
good
one
and
what
are
you
doing
here
you
little
one
confused
at
first
she
did
not
answer
as
she
did
not
in
her
excitement
understand
fully
what
he
said
then
as
soon
as
the
meaning
of
it
dawned
on
her
mind
she
shouted
at
him
indignantly
and
vehemently
i
i
i
am
not
a
woman
i
am
a
prostitute
and
that
is
all
a
prussian
deserves
hardly
had
she
finished
that
he
slapped
her
face
violently
but
as
he
was
raising
his
hand
again
maddened
with
rage
she
caught
on
the
table
a
small
dessert
knife
and
so
quickly
that
nobody
noticed
it
she
stabbed
him
right
in
the
neck
just
at
the
hollow
where
the
breast
begins
a
word
that
he
was
about
to
mutter
was
cut
short
in
his
throat
and
he
remained
stiff
with
his
mouth
open
and
a
frightful
look
all
shouted
and
got
up
tumultuously
but
having
thrown
her
chair
in
the
legs
of
lieutenant
otto
who
collapsed
and
fell
down
at
full
length
she
ran
to
the
window
opened
it
before
they
could
catch
her
and
jumped
out
in
the
night
under
the
rain
that
was
still
falling
in
two
minutes
mademoiselle
fifi
was
dead
then
fritz
and
otto
drew
their
swords
and
wanted
to
massacre
the
women
who
threw
themselves
to
their
knees
the
major
not
without
difficulty
prevented
the
butchery
and
had
the
four
bewildered
girls
locked
up
in
a
room
and
guarded
by
two
soldiers
and
then
as
if
he
were
disposing
his
men
for
battle
he
organized
the
search
for
the
fugitive
quite
certain
that
he
would
catch
her
note
from
brett
the
original
uses
fugutive
but
again
i
think
this
is
a
typographical
error
as
there
is
no
such
word
fifty
men
whipped
by
threats
were
launched
on
her
trail
in
the
park
two
hundred
others
searched
the
woods
and
all
the
houses
of
the
valley
the
table
cleared
in
an
instant
was
turned
into
a
mortuary
bed
and
the
four
officers
straight
rigid
and
sobered
up
with
the
harsh
faces
of
warriors
on
duty
stood
near
the
windows
searching
and
scanning
the
night
the
torrential
rain
was
continuing
an
incessant
rippling
filled
the
darkness
a
floating
murmur
of
water
that
falls
and
water
that
runs
water
that
drops
and
water
that
gushes
forth
suddenly
a
rifle
shot
was
heard
then
another
far
away
and
thus
for
four
hours
one
heard
from
time
to
time
near
or
distant
reports
of
firing
and
rallying
cries
strange
words
shouted
like
a
call
by
guttural
voices
at
daybreak
everybody
returned
two
soldiers
had
been
killed
and
three
others
wounded
by
their
comrades
in
the
eagerness
of
the
chase
and
the
confusion
of
the
nocturnal
pursuit
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
rachel
then
the
inhabitants
were
terrorized
the
houses
searched
most
carefully
the
whole
region
combed
beaten
scoured
the
jewess
did
not
seem
to
have
left
any
trace
of
her
passage
the
general
who
had
been
notified
ordered
to
hush
the
matter
up
so
as
not
to
give
a
bad
example
in
the
army
and
he
disciplined
the
commander
who
in
turn
punished
his
subordinates
the
general
had
said
we
do
not
go
to
war
to
indulge
in
orgies
and
caress
prostitutes
and
exasperated
graf
farlsberg
resolved
to
take
revenge
on
the
country
as
he
needed
a
pretext
to
take
drastic
measures
without
constraint
he
summoned
the
priest
and
ordered
him
to
ring
the
church
bell
at
the
burial
of
markgraf
von
eyrik
contrary
to
general
expectation
the
priest
showed
himself
docile
humble
full
of
attention
and
when
the
body
of
mademoiselle
fifi
carried
by
soldiers
preceded
surrounded
and
followed
by
soldiers
who
marched
with
loaded
rifles
left
the
chateau
on
the
way
to
the
cemetery
for
the
first
time
the
bell
sounded
the
knell
in
a
gay
tone
as
if
a
friendly
hand
had
been
fondling
it
it
rang
also
in
the
evening
and
the
next
day
and
every
day
it
chimed
as
much
as
they
wanted
sometimes
also
in
the
dead
of
night
it
would
ring
all
alone
and
throw
two
or
three
notes
in
the
darkness
seized
by
a
singular
mirth
awakened
one
knew
not
why
all
the
peasants
in
the
neighborhood
then
thought
that
the
bell
had
been
bewitched
and
no
one
except
the
priest
and
the
sexton
came
near
the
a
poor
girl
was
living
up
there
in
fear
and
solitude
secretly
fed
by
those
two
men
she
remained
there
until
the
german
troops
departed
then
one
evening
the
priest
having
borrowed
the
baker
cart
drove
himself
and
the
prisoner
as
far
as
the
gate
of
rouen
when
they
reached
the
gate
the
priest
kissed
her
she
got
off
the
cart
and
quickly
went
back
to
the
disreputable
house
the
keeper
of
which
had
thought
that
she
was
dead
she
was
taken
out
of
the
house
of
prostitution
shortly
afterwards
by
a
patriot
without
prejudice
who
loved
her
for
her
brave
act
and
then
having
loved
her
for
herself
married
her
and
made
of
her
a
lady
as
good
as
many
others
boule
de
suif
for
several
days
in
succession
the
remnants
of
a
routed
army
had
been
passing
through
the
city
they
were
not
troops
but
disorganized
hordes
the
men
had
long
dirty
beards
and
tattered
uniforms
they
walked
with
a
listless
gait
without
flag
nor
formation
all
seemed
exhausted
worn
out
incapable
of
thought
or
resolve
marching
only
by
force
of
habit
and
dropping
with
fatigue
as
soon
as
they
stopped
one
saw
for
the
most
part
hastily
mobilized
men
peaceful
business
men
and
rentiers
bending
under
the
weight
of
their
rifles
young
snappy
volunteers
easily
scared
but
full
of
enthusiasm
ready
to
attack
as
well
as
to
retreat
then
among
them
a
few
red
trousers
fragments
of
a
division
decimated
in
a
great
battle
despondent
artillery
men
aligned
with
these
infantrymen
and
there
and
there
the
shining
helmet
of
a
heavy
footed
dragon
who
had
difficulty
in
keeping
step
with
the
quicker
pace
of
the
soldiers
of
the
line
legions
of
with
heroic
names
avengers
of
defeat
citizens
of
the
tombs
brothers
in
death
passed
in
their
turn
looking
like
bandits
their
leaders
former
drapers
or
grain
merchants
tallow
or
soap
dealers
warriors
for
the
circumstance
who
had
been
commissioned
officers
on
account
of
their
money
or
the
length
of
their
mustaches
covered
with
arms
flannel
and
stripes
they
were
talking
in
a
voice
discussing
plans
of
campaign
and
claiming
that
they
alone
supported
on
their
shoulders
agonizing
france
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
braggarts
were
afraid
of
their
own
men
scoundrels
often
brave
to
excess
but
always
ready
for
pillage
and
debauch
it
was
rumored
that
the
prussians
were
going
to
enter
rouen
the
national
guard
who
for
the
past
two
months
had
been
very
carefully
reconnoitering
in
the
neighboring
woods
at
times
shooting
their
own
sentries
and
getting
ready
to
fight
when
a
little
rabbit
rustled
in
the
bushes
had
been
mustered
out
and
returned
to
their
homes
their
arms
uniforms
all
their
deadly
apparel
with
which
they
had
recently
frightened
the
milestones
along
the
national
highways
for
three
leagues
around
had
suddenly
disappeared
the
last
of
the
french
soldiers
had
just
crossed
the
seine
to
go
to
by
saint
sever
and
and
following
them
all
their
general
desperate
unable
to
attempt
anything
with
such
wrecks
himself
dismayed
in
the
crushing
debacle
of
a
people
accustomed
to
conquer
and
now
disastrously
defeated
despite
their
legendary
bravery
was
walking
between
two
orderlies
then
a
profound
calm
a
trembling
and
silent
expectancy
hovered
over
the
city
many
corpulent
well
to
do
citizens
emasculated
by
the
business
life
they
had
led
were
anxiously
waiting
for
the
victors
fearing
lest
they
might
consider
as
weapons
their
roasting
spits
or
their
large
kitchen
knives
life
seemed
to
be
at
a
standstill
the
shops
were
closed
and
the
streets
silent
and
deserted
sometimes
a
citizen
intimidated
by
this
silence
ran
rapidly
along
the
walls
the
anguish
of
suspense
made
the
citizens
desire
the
arrival
of
the
enemy
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
that
followed
the
departure
of
the
french
troops
a
few
uhlans
coming
from
no
one
knew
where
crossed
the
city
in
a
hurry
then
a
little
later
a
black
mass
came
down
the
ste
catherine
hill
while
two
other
invading
waves
appeared
on
the
darnetal
and
boisguillame
roads
the
vanguards
of
the
three
corps
made
their
junction
at
precisely
the
same
time
in
the
hotel
de
ville
square
and
by
all
the
neighboring
roads
the
german
army
was
arriving
rolling
its
battalions
that
made
the
pavements
ring
under
their
heavy
and
well
measured
steps
orders
shouted
in
an
unknown
and
guttural
voice
rose
along
the
houses
which
seemed
dead
and
deserted
while
behind
the
closed
shutters
eyes
watched
these
victorious
men
masters
of
the
city
of
property
and
life
by
the
right
of
war
the
inhabitants
in
their
darkened
rooms
felt
the
bewilderment
caused
by
cataclysms
the
great
bloody
upheavals
of
the
earth
against
which
all
human
wisdom
and
force
are
of
no
avail
for
the
same
feeling
reappears
whenever
the
established
order
of
things
is
upset
when
security
ceases
to
exist
when
all
that
is
protected
by
the
laws
of
men
or
those
of
protected
nature
is
at
the
mercy
of
unreasoning
and
ferocious
brutality
the
earthquake
crushing
a
whole
nation
under
crumbling
houses
the
overflowing
river
swirling
the
bodies
of
drowned
peasants
along
with
the
dead
oxen
and
the
beams
torn
away
from
the
roofs
or
the
glorious
army
massacring
those
who
defend
themselves
taking
away
the
others
as
prisoners
pillaging
in
the
name
of
the
sword
and
offering
thanks
to
god
to
the
thunder
of
the
guns
are
as
many
appalling
scourges
which
disconcert
any
belief
in
eternal
justice
all
the
trust
we
were
taught
to
place
in
the
protection
of
heaven
and
the
reason
of
man
small
detachments
knocked
at
each
door
and
then
disappeared
in
the
houses
it
was
occupation
after
invasion
now
the
vanquished
had
to
show
themselves
nice
to
their
conquerors
after
a
while
once
the
first
terror
had
abated
a
new
tranquility
settled
down
in
many
houses
the
prussian
officer
took
his
meals
with
the
family
some
were
well
bred
and
out
of
politeness
showed
sympathy
for
france
and
spoke
of
their
reluctance
to
participate
in
the
war
people
were
grateful
for
such
sentiments
furthermore
they
might
have
needed
their
protection
any
day
by
being
nice
to
them
they
would
possibly
have
fewer
men
billeted
to
their
houses
and
why
hurt
the
feelings
of
a
man
who
had
full
power
over
them
to
act
in
that
way
would
be
less
bravery
than
temerity
and
temerity
is
no
longer
a
failing
of
the
citizens
of
rouen
as
in
the
days
of
heroic
defense
when
their
city
became
famous
last
of
all
supreme
argument
derived
from
french
urbanity
they
said
that
they
could
allow
themselves
to
be
polite
in
their
own
houses
provided
they
did
not
exhibit
in
public
too
much
familiarity
with
the
foreign
soldier
on
the
streets
they
passed
each
other
as
strangers
but
at
home
they
willingly
chatted
and
every
night
the
german
stayed
up
later
and
later
warming
himself
at
the
family
even
the
city
was
gradually
resuming
some
of
its
ordinary
aspect
the
french
were
seldom
seen
promenading
in
the
streets
but
prussian
soldiers
swarmed
besides
the
officers
of
the
blue
hussars
who
arrogantly
rattled
their
big
instruments
of
death
on
the
pavements
did
not
seem
to
have
for
the
plain
citizens
enormously
more
contempt
than
the
officers
of
the
french
chasseurs
who
the
year
before
had
been
drinking
in
the
same
cafés
there
was
however
something
in
the
air
something
subtle
and
unknown
an
intolerable
foreign
atmosphere
like
an
offensive
odor
the
smell
of
invasion
it
pervaded
the
houses
and
the
public
places
changed
the
taste
of
food
and
made
you
feel
as
if
you
were
traveling
in
far
distant
lands
amid
barbarians
and
dangerous
tribes
the
conquerors
exacted
money
a
great
deal
of
money
the
citizens
kept
on
paying
they
could
afford
to
pay
they
were
rich
but
the
more
a
norman
businessman
becomes
opulent
the
more
he
suffers
when
he
has
to
make
any
sacrifice
or
sees
any
parcel
of
his
property
pass
into
the
hands
of
others
and
yet
within
a
distance
of
two
or
three
leagues
from
the
city
down
the
river
in
the
direction
of
croisset
dieppendalle
or
biessart
boatmen
and
fishermen
often
hauled
from
the
bottom
of
the
water
the
body
of
some
german
swollen
in
his
uniform
killed
with
a
knife
or
by
a
blow
of
savate
his
head
crushed
by
a
stone
or
pushed
from
a
bridge
into
the
water
the
mud
of
the
buried
such
obscure
savage
and
yet
legitimate
vengeances
unknown
acts
of
heroism
silent
attacks
more
perilous
than
battles
in
the
open
and
yet
without
any
of
the
halo
and
glamour
of
glory
for
hatred
of
the
foreigner
always
arms
some
intrepid
persons
ready
to
die
for
an
idea
as
the
invaders
although
subjecting
the
city
to
their
inflexible
discipline
had
committed
none
of
the
horrors
which
rumor
credited
them
with
having
perpetrated
all
along
their
triumphal
march
people
became
bolder
and
desire
to
do
business
belabored
again
the
hearts
of
the
local
merchants
some
of
them
had
large
interest
in
havre
which
was
occupied
by
the
french
army
and
they
tried
to
reach
that
sea
port
in
going
by
land
to
dieppe
and
proceeding
from
there
by
boat
they
used
the
influence
of
the
german
officers
with
whom
they
had
become
acquainted
and
a
special
permit
was
secured
from
the
general
in
chief
now
then
a
large
coach
having
been
engaged
for
this
trip
and
ten
persons
having
had
their
names
booked
with
the
driver
it
was
decided
to
leave
on
a
tuesday
morning
before
daybreak
to
avoid
attracting
any
crowd
for
some
time
past
the
frost
had
hardened
the
ground
and
on
that
particular
monday
at
about
three
big
black
clouds
coming
from
the
north
brought
the
snow
which
fell
without
interruption
all
that
evening
and
during
the
whole
night
at
half
past
four
in
the
morning
the
travelers
met
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hôtel
de
normandie
where
they
were
to
take
the
coach
they
were
still
half
asleep
and
shivered
with
cold
under
their
wraps
they
could
not
see
each
other
well
in
the
darkness
and
bundled
in
their
heavy
winter
clothing
their
bodies
looked
like
fat
priests
in
their
long
cassocks
two
men
recognized
each
other
a
third
joined
them
they
talked
i
am
taking
my
wife
with
me
said
one
so
am
i
and
i
too
the
first
speaker
continued
we
shall
not
come
back
to
rouen
and
if
the
prussians
should
threaten
havre
we
shall
cross
over
to
england
they
all
had
the
same
plans
being
of
similar
disposition
however
the
horses
were
not
yet
harnessed
a
small
lantern
carried
by
a
stable
boy
came
now
and
then
out
of
a
dark
doorway
and
immediately
disappeared
in
another
horses
were
stamping
the
ground
but
their
hooves
being
covered
with
dung
and
straw
the
noise
of
the
stamping
was
deadened
a
man
voice
talking
to
the
animals
and
swearing
at
them
was
heard
from
the
rear
of
the
building
a
faint
tickle
grew
soon
into
a
clear
and
continuous
jingling
rhythmical
with
the
movements
of
the
horses
now
stopping
now
resuming
in
a
sudden
peal
accompanied
by
the
deadened
noise
of
an
hoof
pawing
the
ground
the
door
closed
suddenly
all
the
noise
ceased
the
frozen
passengers
stopped
talking
they
stood
motionless
and
stiff
an
uninterrupted
curtain
of
white
glistening
flakes
ceaselessly
fell
on
the
ground
it
obliterated
the
forms
of
things
and
powdered
them
with
an
icy
foam
and
in
the
great
silence
of
the
quiet
city
buried
under
the
winter
one
could
hear
nothing
save
that
vague
nameless
rustle
of
the
falling
snow
a
sensation
rather
than
a
sound
an
intermingling
of
light
atoms
which
seemed
to
fill
the
space
and
cover
the
whole
world
the
man
reappeared
with
his
lantern
leading
by
a
rope
a
horse
who
followed
him
reluctantly
he
placed
him
against
the
shaft
fastened
the
straps
turned
around
for
a
long
time
to
make
sure
that
the
harness
was
properly
fixed
for
he
could
use
only
one
hand
the
other
holding
the
lantern
as
he
was
going
to
bring
the
second
animal
he
noticed
that
all
the
travelers
were
standing
still
already
white
with
snow
and
he
told
them
why
do
you
get
in
the
coach
there
you
would
be
under
shelter
at
least
no
doubt
this
had
not
occurred
to
them
at
once
there
was
a
rush
to
get
in
the
three
men
installed
their
wives
in
the
rear
of
the
coach
and
then
got
in
themselves
one
after
the
other
the
remaining
indistinct
and
snow
covered
forms
took
the
last
seats
without
exchanging
a
single
word
the
floor
was
covered
with
straw
into
which
the
feet
sank
the
ladies
in
the
rear
having
brought
with
them
small
copper
heated
by
means
of
a
chemical
coal
lighted
these
apparatuses
and
for
some
time
in
a
low
voice
they
enumerated
their
advantages
repeating
to
each
other
things
which
they
had
not
known
for
a
long
time
at
last
six
horses
instead
of
four
having
been
harnessed
to
the
coach
on
account
of
the
difficult
roads
and
heavier
draft
a
voice
from
the
outside
asked
is
everybody
in
to
which
a
voice
replied
from
the
inside
yes
and
the
coach
started
the
coach
proceeded
slowly
slowly
at
a
snail
pace
the
wheels
sank
into
the
snow
the
entire
body
of
the
carriage
groaned
with
creaks
the
animals
were
slipping
puffing
steaming
and
the
driver
gigantic
whip
was
cracking
continuously
flying
in
every
direction
coiling
up
and
unrolling
itself
like
a
thin
snake
and
suddenly
lashing
some
rounded
back
which
then
stretched
out
under
a
more
violent
effort
imperceptibly
the
day
was
breaking
those
light
flakes
that
a
traveler
a
pure
blood
native
of
rouen
had
compared
to
a
rain
of
cotton
had
stopped
falling
a
murky
light
filtered
through
the
big
dark
and
heavy
clouds
which
rendered
more
dazzling
the
whiteness
of
the
country
where
one
could
see
now
a
line
of
tall
trees
spangled
with
hoar
frost
now
a
cottage
with
a
snow
hood
inside
the
coach
the
travelers
eyed
each
other
inquisitively
in
the
melancholy
light
of
the
dawn
way
in
the
rear
on
the
best
seats
facing
each
other
and
loiseau
wholesale
wine
dealers
of
the
rue
were
slumbering
former
clerk
to
a
merchant
who
had
been
ruined
in
business
loiseau
had
bought
his
employer
stock
and
made
a
fortune
he
was
selling
very
cheap
very
bad
wine
to
small
liquor
dealers
in
the
country
and
was
considered
by
his
friends
and
acquaintances
as
a
sharp
crook
a
real
norman
full
of
wiles
and
joviality
his
reputation
as
a
crook
was
so
well
established
that
one
evening
at
the
prefecture
tournel
a
writer
of
fables
and
songs
a
biting
and
fine
wit
a

proposed
to
the
ladies
whom
he
saw
rather
drowsy
to
play
a
game
of
vole
the
bird
steals
flies
the
joke
flew
through
the
salons
of
the
prefect
and
from
there
reaching
those
of
the
town
made
all
the
jaws
of
the
province
laugh
for
a
whole
month
in
addition
to
this
unsavory
reputation
loiseau
was
famous
for
his
various
practical
jokes
his
good
or
bad
tricks
and
nobody
could
mention
his
name
without
adding
immediately
loiseau
is
merciless
he
spares
nobody
undersized
he
had
a
balloon
shaped

surmounted
by
a
florid
face
between
a

of
grayish
whiskers
his

represented

and

her

enlivened
by
his

beside

business
proprietor
of
three
spinning

officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
member
of
the
general
council
during
the
empire
he
had
been
the
leader
of
the
friendly
opposition
solely
for
the
purpose
of
commanding
a
higher
price
for
his
support
when
he
rallied
to
the
cause
which
he
was
fighting
daily
with
courteous
weapons
according
to
his
own
expression
considerably
younger
than
her
husband
remained
the
consolation
of
officers
belonging
to
good
families
who
had
been
quartered
in
rouen
she
was
sitting
opposite
her
husband
pretty
slender
graceful
curled
in
her
furs
and
gazed
mournfully
at
the
lamentable
interior
of
the
coach
her
neighbors
count
and
countess
hubert
de
bréville
bore
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
noble
names
of
normandy
the
count
an
old
nobleman
of
aristocratic
bearing
endeavored
to
accentuate
by
the
artifices
of
his
toilette
his
natural
resemblance
to
king
henry
iv
who
according
to
a
legend
in
which
the
family
gloried
had
caused
the
maternity
of
a
de
bréville
lady
whose
husband
on
account
of
his
royal
connection
had
been
made
a
count
and
governor
of
a
province
a
colleague
of
in
the
general
council
count
hubert
represented
the
orleanist
party
in
his
department
the
story
of
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
a
small
of
nantes
had
always
remained
mysterious
but
as
the
countess
had
a
grand
air
entertained
better
than
any
other
hostess
and
was
credited
with
having
been
the
dulcinea
of
one
of
louis
philippe
sons
the
whole
nobility
showed
her
the
greatest
consideration
and
her
salon
remained
the
most
exclusive
in
the
locality
the
only
one
where
old
gallantry
was
conserved
and
admission
to
which
was
not
easy
the
wealth
of
the
de
brévilles
all
invested
in
real
estate
was
estimated
to
yield
an
annual
income
of
five
hundred
thousand
francs
these
six
persons
occupied
the
rear
of
the
coach
the
side
of
wealthy
serene
and
solid
society
authoritative
honest
people
who
have
religion
and
principles
by
a
strange
hazard
all
the
women
were
seated
on
the
same
side
and
the
countess
further
had
for
neighbors
two
saintly
nuns
who
fingered
long
rosaries
and
mumbled
paters
and
aves
one
of
them
was
old
and
had
a
face
so
deeply
pitted
with
smallpox
that
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
shot
full
in
the
face
by
a
gun
the
other
very
frail
had
a
pretty
and
sickly
head
on
a
narrow
consumptive
chest
eaten
up
by
that
devouring
faith
which
makes
martyrs
and
visionaries
seated
opposite
the
nuns
a
man
and
a
woman
attracted
the
eyes
of
all
the
other
passengers
the
man
a
well
known
character
was
cornudet
the
democrat
the
terror
of
respectable
people
since
twenty
years
he
had
been
dipping
his
large
red
beard
in
the
bocks
of
all
the
democratic
cafés
he
had
spent
with
the
help
of
his
brethren
and
friends
a
good
sized
fortune
inherited
from
his
father
a
retired
confectioner
and
he
was
impatiently
waiting
for
the
advent
of
the
republic
to
secure
a
political
position
deserved
by
so
many
revolutionary
libations
on
the
fourth
of
september
possibly
as
a
result
of
a
practical
joke
he
had
thought
that
he
had
been
appointed
prefect
but
when
he
wanted
to
take
up
his
duties
the
clerk
who
had
remained
in
charge
of
the
office
refused
to
recognize
him
which
compelled
him
to
retire
a
very
good
natured
chap
and
moreover
inoffensive
and
serviable
he
had
worked
with
an
incomparable
energy
to
organize
the
defense
of
the
city
he
had
had
trenches
dug
in
the
plains
all
the
young
trees
in
the
neighboring
forests
cut
down
traps
set
on
all
the
roads
and
at
the
approach
of
the
enemy
satisfied
with
his
preparations
he
had
hurriedly
returned
to
town
he
thought
now
that
he
would
be
more
useful
in
havre
where
new
trenches
were
going
to
be
needed
the
woman
one
of
those
called
gallant
was
famous
for
her
precocious
embonpoint
which
had
earned
her
the
nickname
of
boule
de
suif
ball
of
tallow
short
and
rotund
all
over
fat
enough
to
supply
lard
with
puffed
fingers
constricted
at
the
joints
and
looking
like
strings
of
small
sausages
a
shiny
and
tight
skin
an
enormous
bust
which
protruded
from
under
her
gown
she
was
yet
attractive
and
much
coveted
her
fresh
appearance
being
pleasant
to
look
at
her
face
was
like
a
red
apple
a
peony
bud
ready
to
bloom
forth
and
in
the
upper
part
of
her
face
two
magnificent
black
eyes
shaded
by
large
thick
lashes
which
cast
a
shadow
into
them
in
the
lower
part
a
charming
mouth
narrow
moist
ripe
for
kisses
and
furnished
with
white
and
microscopic
teeth
moreover
she
was
said
to
be
full
of
invaluable
qualities
as
soon
as
she
was
recognized
whispers
circulated
among
the
respectable
women
and
the
words
hussy
public
scandal
were
spoken
so
loud
that
she
raised
her
head
then
she
turned
on
her
neighbors
such
a
challenging
and
haughty
look
that
a
great
silence
fell
on
the
company
and
they
all
lowered
their
eyes
except
loiseau
who
kept
on
watching
her
with
an
exhilarated
air
but
soon
the
conversation
was
resumed
between
the
three
ladies
whom
the
presence
of
this
girl
had
suddenly
made
friends
almost
intimates
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
should
form
a
sort
of
fasces
of
their
conjugal
dignities
in
the
presence
of
this
shameless
mercenary
for
legalized
love
always
looks
down
on
its
free
brother
the
three
men
also
drawn
closer
by
an
instinct
of
conservation
at
the
sight
of
cornudet
spoke
of
money
matters
with
an
expression
of
contempt
for
the
poor
count
hubert
related
the
damage
done
to
his
property
by
the
prussians
the
losses
that
would
result
from
their
stealing
of
a
tenfold
millionaire
grand
seigneur
whom
such
reverses
would
hardly
incommodate
for
one
year
who
had
suffered
serious
losses
in
his
cotton
business
had
taken
the
precaution
of
sending
six
hundred
thousand
francs
to
england
a
provision
for
rainy
days
which
would
enable
him
to
meet
emergencies
as
to
loiseau
he
had
found
a
way
of
selling
to
the
french
quartermaster
office
all
the
low
grade
wines
he
had
in
stock
so
that
the
government
owed
him
a
tremendous
sum
which
he
expected
to
cash
in
time
at
havre
and
all
three
cast
at
each
other
quick
and
friendly
glances
although
belonging
to
different
social
sets
they
felt
united
in
the
brotherhood
of
money
the
great
freemasonry
of
those
who
possess
who
jingle
gold
when
they
put
their
hands
in
the
pockets
of
their
trousers
the
coach
was
making
such
slow
headway
that
at
ten
they
had
traveled
only
four
leagues
the
men
got
off
three
times
and
walked
up
the
hills
they
began
to
feel
uneasy
because
they
expected
to
have
luncheon
in
tôtes
and
now
there
was
hardly
any
possibility
of
getting
there
before
night
each
was
watching
to
find
an
inn
on
the
road
when
the
coach
foundered
in
a
and
it
took
two
hours
to
extricate
it
appetites
grew
and
spirits
fell
no
no
wine
dealer
could
be
discovered
the
approach
of
the
prussians
and
the
passage
of
the
starving
french
troops
having
frightened
away
all
the
the
men
went
to
the
farmhouses
by
the
roadside
to
look
for
food
but
they
did
not
even
find
bread
for
the
suspicious
peasants
had
hidden
away
their
reserve
of
provisions
for
fear
of
being
pillaged
by
the
soldiers
who
having
nothing
to
eat
were
taking
forcibly
what
they
discovered
toward
one
in
the
afternoon
loiseau
announced
that
positively
he
felt
a
big
hollow
in
his
stomach
all
of
them
had
been
suffering
like
him
for
a
long
time
and
the
violent
craving
for
food
growing
steadily
had
killed
off
the
conversations
from
time
to
time
one
of
them
yawned
another
imitated
him
instantly
and
each
in
turn
according
to
his
character
manners
and
social
position
opened
his
mouth
noisily
or
modestly
holding
his
hand
before
the
gaping
hole
from
which
breath
steamed
out
boule
de
suif
stooped
several
times
as
if
looking
for
something
under
her
petticoats
she
hesitated
a
second
looked
at
her
neighbors
and
the
straightened
herself
up
quietly
faces
were
pale
and
drawn
loiseau
said
that
he
would
pay
one
thousand
francs
for
a
knuckle
of
ham
his
wife
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
protest
then
she
became
calm
she
always
suffered
when
she
heard
of
money
being
squandered
and
did
not
even
understand
jokes
on
that
subject
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
feel
well
said
the
count
why
did
i
not
think
of
taking
provisions
with
me
every
one
was
reproaching
himself
with
the
same
omission
cornudet
however
had
a
pocket
bottle
of
rum
he
offered
some
to
his
companions
they
refused
coldly
loiseau
alone
accepted
a
few
drops
and
when
he
returned
the
bottle
he
thanked
it
is
good
all
the
same
it
warms
you
up
and
it
cheats
the
appetite
the
drink
put
him
in
good
humor
and
he
proposed
that
they
should
do
as
on
the
small
boat
in
the
song
eat
the
fattest
of
the
passengers
this
indirect
allusion
to
boule
de
suif
shocked
the
passengers
there
was
no
response
cornudet
alone
smiled
the
two
good
sisters
had
ceased
to
mumble
their
rosary
and
with
their
hands
thrust
down
in
their
wide
sleeves
they
held
themselves
motionless
obstinately
lowering
their
eyes
and
doubtless
offering
up
as
a
sacrifice
to
god
the
suffering
he
had
sent
them
at
last
at
three
as
they
were
still
in
the
middle
of
an
interminable
plain
without
any
village
in
sight
boule
de
suif
bent
down
quickly
and
from
under
her
seat
pulled
out
a
large
basket
covered
with
a
white
napkin
she
drew
out
first
a
small
earthen
plate
a
fine
silver
drinking
cup
then
a
large
pot
in
which
two
whole
chickens
carved
in
pieces
had
stewed
in
their
own
gravy
and
one
could
further
see
in
the
basket
other
good
things
wrapped
up
pastry
fruit
delicacies
provisions
prepared
for
a
three
days
trip
so
that
the
traveler
would
not
have
to
touch
the
food
in
the
inns
the
neck
of
four
bottles
emerged
from
among
the
food
packages
she
took
the
wing
of
a
chicken
and
began
to
eat
it
delicately
with
one
of
those
small
rolls
which
in
normandy
are
called
régence
all
the
eyes
were
attracted
in
her
direction
then
the
appetizing
smell
filled
the
coach
making
the
nostrils
dilate
and
mouths
water
while
the
jaws
under
the
ears
contracted
painfully
the
contempt
of
the
ladies
for
this
girl
was
becoming
ferocious
developing
into
a
desire
to
kill
her
or
throw
her
with
her
drinking
cup
her
basket
and
her
provisions
out
of
the
coach
on
the
snow
all
the
while
loiseau
had
been
devouring
with
his
eyes
the
pot
of
chicken
he
said
well
well
the
lady
has
been
more
provident
than
all
of
us
there
are
persons
who
always
manage
to
think
of
everything
she
raised
her
head
towards
him
would
you
like
some
sir
it
is
hard
to
fast
since
morning
and
looking
around
him
he
added
in
moments
like
this
one
is
glad
to
find
obliging
people
he
had
a
newspaper
which
he
unfolded
on
his
knees
in
order
not
to
soil
his
trousers
and
with
the
point
of
a
knife
which
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
he
picked
a
leg
thoroughly
varnished
with
jelly
bit
it
off
and
chewed
it
with
such
evident
relish
that
there
arose
in
the
coach
a
heavy
sigh
of
distress
boule
de
suif
with
a
humble
and
gentle
voice
proposed
to
the
good
sisters
to
share
her
luncheon
they
both
accepted
instantly
and
without
raising
their
eyes
began
to
eat
very
fast
after
having
muttered
a
few
words
of
thanks
neither
did
cornudet
decline
the
offer
of
his
neighbor
and
with
the
nuns
they
improvised
a
sort
of
table
by
unfolding
newspapers
on
their
knees
mouths
were
opening
and
closing
constantly
swallowing
chewing
gulping
ferociously
loiseau
in
his
corner
was
very
busy
eating
and
in
a
low
voice
was
urging
his
wife
to
imitate
him
she
resisted
for
a
long
time
but
after
a
cramp
which
ran
through
her
stomach
she
yielded
then
her
husband
rounding
his
sentences
asked
their
charming
companion
whether
she
would
allow
him
to
offer
a
small
piece
to
madame
loiseau
she
replied
why
certainly
sir
with
an
amiable
smile
and
held
out
the
terrine
an
embarrassment
occurred
when
the
first
bottle
of
claret
was
opened
there
was
only
one
drinking
cup
they
passed
it
around
after
wiping
it
each
time
cornudet
alone
no
doubt
in
a
spirit
of
gallantry
put
his
lips
on
the
spot
which
was
still
moist
from
the
lips
of
his
neighbor
then
surrounded
by
people
who
were
eating
suffocated
by
the
emanations
of
the
food
count
and
countess
de
bréville
as
well
as
and
were
suffering
from
that
torture
which
has
perpetuated
the
name
of
tantalus
all
at
once
the
young
wife
heaved
a
sigh
which
caused
every
one
to
turn
and
look
at
her
she
was
as
white
as
the
snow
outside
her
eyes
closed
her
head
fell
forward
and
she
fainted
her
husband
alarmed
was
imploring
everybody
help
all
lost
their
heads
but
the
oldest
of
the
two
nuns
holding
in
her
arm
the
head
of
the
unconscious
lady
slipped
between
her
lips
the
drinking
cup
of
boule
de
suif
and
made
her
swallow
a
few
drops
of
wine
the
pretty
lady
moved
opened
her
eyes
smiled
and
declared
in
a
dying
voice
that
she
felt
better
however
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
fainting
the
nun
obliged
her
to
drink
a
full
cup
of
claret
and
she
added
it
is
just
hunger
and
nothing
else
then
boule
de
suif
blushing
and
embarrassed
stammered
looking
at
the
four
passengers
who
had
not
yet
broken
their
fast
mon
dieu
if
i
ventured
to
offer
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
she
stopped
short
thinking
she
had
hurt
their
feelings
loiseau
began
to
speak
well
by
jove
in
cases
like
this
we
are
all
brothers
and
sisters
and
must
help
each
other
come
ladies
no
ceremony
accept
what
is
offered
what
the
devil
do
we
even
know
whether
we
are
going
to
find
a
house
to
shelter
us
during
the
night
at
the
rate
at
which
we
are
traveling
we
shall
not
be
in
tôtes
before
noon
they
hesitated
none
daring
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
saying
yes
but
the
count
settled
the
question
he
turned
to
the
intimidated
fat
girl
and
assuming
his
grand
aristocratic
tone
he
said
to
her
we
accept
gratefully
madame
the
first
step
only
costs
once
the
rubicon
crossed
they
ate
heartily
the
basket
was
emptied
it
still
contained
one
paté
de
foie
gras
one
paté
de
mauvette
a
piece
of
smoked
ham
crassane
pears
a
cheese
assorted
and
a
cup
full
of
pickled
gherkins
and
onions
boule
de
suif
like
all
women
having
a
predilection
for
raw
things
one
could
not
partake
of
the
girl
provisions
without
speaking
to
her
now
then
they
talked
first
with
some
restraint
then
as
she
behaved
very
well
with
more
freedom
mesdames
de
bréville
and
who
had
great
made
themselves
tactfully
gracious
specially
the
countess
showed
that
amiable
condescension
of
great
ladies
whom
no
contact
can
sully
and
she
was
charming
on
the
other
hand
fat
madame
loiseau
who
had
the
soul
of
a
gendarme
remained
distant
sullen
saying
little
but
eating
much
naturally
they
talked
about
the
war
they
told
the
horrible
things
done
by
the
prussians
the
deeds
of
bravery
of
the
french
and
all
these
people
who
were
fleeing
paid
homage
to
the
courage
of
others
personal
experiences
soon
followed
and
boule
de
suif
related
with
unaffected
emotion
with
that
warmth
of
language
often
characteristic
of
girls
of
her
class
in
expressing
their
natural
feelings
how
she
had
left
rouen
first
i
thought
that
i
could
stay
she
said
i
had
my
house
full
of
provisions
and
i
preferred
to
feed
a
few
soldiers
then
expatriate
myself
and
go
god
knows
where
but
when
i
saw
them
the
prussians
it
was
too
much
for
me
i
could
not
stand
it
they
made
my
blood
boil
with
rage
and
i
wept
all
day
for
very
shame
then
some
were
billeted
to
my
house
i
flew
at
the
throat
of
the
first
one
who
entered
and
i
would
have
fixed
that
one
if
they
had
not
pulled
me
away
by
the
hair
after
that
i
had
to
hide
finally
i
found
an
opportunity
to
go
i
left
and
here
i
am
she
was
warmly
congratulated
she
was
rising
in
the
esteem
of
her
traveling
companions
who
had
not
shown
themselves
as
fearless
and
in
listening
to
her
cornudet
had
the
approving
and
benevolent
smile
of
an
apostle
in
the
same
way
as
a
priest
hears
a
devout
person
praise
god
for
democrats
have
the
monopoly
of
patriotism
just
as
the
men
in
cassocks
have
the
monopoly
of
religion
he
spoke
in
his
turn
with
a
dogmatic
tone
with
the
declamatory
emphasis
learned
from
proclamations
daily
posted
on
the
walls
and
he
winded
up
with
a
piece
of
eloquence
in
which
he
condemned
masterfully
that
scoundrel
of
napoleon
iii
but
boule
de
suif
became
angry
immediately
because
she
was
a
partisan
of
the
bonapartes
she
turned
as
red
as
a
cherry
and
stuttering
with
indignation
i
should
have
like
to
see
you
in
his
place
you
and
your
friends
it
would
have
been
nice
oh
yes
it
is
you
who
betrayed
the
poor
man
if
we
were
ruled
by
rascals
like
you
there
would
remain
nothing
else
to
do
for
us
but
leave
france
impassive
cornudet
kept
a
superior
and
contemptuous
smile
but
one
could
feel
that
big
words
were
impending
when
the
count
interposed
and
not
without
some
difficulty
calmed
the
exasperated
girl
by
proclaiming
authoritatively
that
all
sincere
opinions
should
be
respected
however
the
countess
and
the
wife
of
the
cotton
manufacturer
who
bore
in
their
hearts
the
unreasoning
hatred
of
all
decent
people
for
the
republic
and
that
predilection
which
all
women
have
for
the
pomp
of
despotic
governments
felt
irresistibly
attracted
toward
this
dignified
prostitute
whose
opinions
were
very
much
like
theirs
the
basket
was
empty
the
ten
of
them
had
easily
consumed
its
contents
regretting
that
it
was
not
larger
the
conversation
continued
for
some
time
though
it
flagged
since
they
had
finished
eating
the
night
was
falling
darkness
gradually
grew
deeper
and
deeper
and
the
cold
felt
more
during
digestion
made
boule
de
suif
shiver
notwithstanding
her
corpulence
then
madame
de
bréville
offered
her
her
the
coal
of
which
had
been
renewed
several
times
since
the
morning
and
she
accepted
it
willingly
for
she
felt
her
feet
frozen
mesdames
and
loiseau
gave
theirs
to
the
nuns
the
driver
had
lighted
his
lanterns
they
threw
a
bright
gleam
on
the
cloud
of
vapor
rising
from
the
perspiring
backs
of
the
rear
horses
and
on
both
sides
of
the
road
the
snow
seemed
to
unroll
under
the
mobile
light
of
the
lamps
nothing
could
be
distinguished
in
the
coach
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
between
boule
de
suif
and
cornudet
and
loiseau
whose
eyes
scanned
the
darkness
through
that
he
saw
the
man
jump
up
as
if
he
had
received
a
noiseless
but
well
aimed
blow
tiny
lights
appeared
ahead
on
the
road
it
was
tôtes
they
had
traveled
eleven
hours
which
added
to
the
hours
of
rest
given
in
four
times
to
the
horses
for
feeding
and
breathing
made
fourteen
hours
they
entered
the
town
and
the
coach
stopped
in
front
of
the
hotel
du
commerce
the
door
of
the
coach
opened
a
well
known
noise
startled
all
the
passengers
it
was
the
clanging
of
a
scabbard
on
the
pavement
then
the
voice
of
a
german
called
out
something
although
the
coach
was
at
a
standstill
nobody
got
off
as
if
they
were
expecting
to
be
massacred
the
moment
they
left
the
coach
then
the
driver
appeared
holding
in
his
hand
one
of
his
lanterns
which
suddenly
lighted
the
interior
of
the
coach
and
shoed
two
rows
of
frightened
faces
whose
mouths
were
agape
and
eyes
wide
open
in
surprise
and
terror
beside
the
driver
in
full
light
stood
a
german
officer
a
tall
young
man
exceedingly
thin
and
blond
laced
in
his
uniform
as
tightly
as
a
girl
in
her
corset
and
wearing
tilted
to
one
side
his
flat
and
waxed
cap
which
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
porter
in
an
english
hotel
his
exaggerated
mustache
long
and
straight
tapering
indefinitely
on
both
sides
and
ending
in
a
single
blond
hair
so
thin
that
the
point
could
not
be
seen
seemed
to
weigh
on
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
pulling
down
his
cheeks
impressed
on
the
lips
a
drooping
fold
in
alsatian
french
he
invited
the
travelers
to
alight
saying
in
a
stiff
tone
will
you
please
get
off
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
two
good
sisters
obeyed
first
with
the
docility
of
holy
women
accustomed
to
submission
the
count
and
countess
appeared
next
followed
by
the
manufacturer
and
his
wife
then
loiseau
pushing
in
front
of
him
his
larger
and
better
half
loiseau
as
he
got
off
told
the
officer
good
day
sir
prompted
by
a
feeling
of
prudence
much
more
than
politeness
the
officer
insolent
like
all
men
holding
absolute
authority
stared
at
him
and
did
not
reply
boule
de
suif
and
cornudet
although
near
the
door
of
the
coach
were
the
last
to
alight
serious
and
dignified
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
the
corpulent
girl
was
trying
to
control
herself
and
be
calm
the
democrat
with
a
tragic
and
rather
shaky
hand
was
tormenting
his
reddish
beard
they
wanted
to
maintain
their
dignity
being
fully
conscious
of
the
fact
that
at
such
meetings
each
represents
a
little
his
country
and
both
equally
revolted
by
the
supineness
of
their
companions
she
tried
to
show
herself
more
proud
than
her
neighbors
the
honest
women
while
he
realizing
that
he
owed
an
example
continued
in
his
whole
attitude
his
mission
of
resistance
first
assumed
when
he
mined
and
destroyed
the
highways
they
entered
the
spacious
kitchen
of
the
inn
and
the
german
having
called
for
and
inspected
the
permit
to
leave
rouen
signed
by
the
general
in
chief
in
which
were
mentioned
the
names
description
and
profession
of
each
traveler
examined
them
for
a
long
while
comparing
the
persons
with
the
written
particulars
he
said
abruptly
all
right
and
he
disappeared
then
they
breathed
freely
they
were
still
hungry
supper
was
ordered
it
required
half
an
hour
to
prepare
it
and
while
two
servants
were
apparently
engaged
in
getting
it
ready
the
travelers
went
upstairs
to
have
a
look
at
their
rooms
they
were
all
in
a
long
hall
ending
in
a
glazed
door
marked
with
a
speaking
number
they
were
going
to
sit
down
to
supper
when
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
appeared
he
was
a
former
horse
dealer
a
stout
asthmatic
man
always
wheezing
coughing
and
clearing
his
throat
his
father
had
transmitted
him
the
name
of
follenvie
he
inquired
mademoiselle
elizabeth
rousset
boule
de
suif
started
she
turned
around
that
is
my
name
mademoiselle
the
prussian
officer
wants
to
speak
to
you
immediately
to
me
yes
if
you
are
mlle
elizabeth
rousset
she
became
uneasy
reflected
a
moment
then
declared
squarely
that
may
be
but
i
shall
not
go
there
was
a
movement
around
her
each
discussed
and
speculated
as
to
the
cause
of
this
order
the
count
came
near
her
you
are
wrong
madame
because
your
refusal
might
bring
considerable
trouble
not
only
to
you
but
also
to
all
your
traveling
companions
we
should
never
resist
those
who
are
the
strongest
assuredly
your
compliance
with
this
order
can
not
involve
any
danger
no
doubt
you
are
wanted
for
some
forgotten
formality
all
joined
the
count
in
urging
her
pressing
her
lecturing
her
and
finally
they
convinced
her
for
all
of
them
dreaded
complications
which
might
result
from
insubordination
on
her
part
at
last
she
said
i
am
doing
this
for
your
sake
do
forget
it
the
countess
took
her
hand
and
we
thank
you
for
it
she
went
out
all
waited
for
her
return
before
they
sat
down
at
the
table
each
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
been
called
instead
of
that
violent
and
irascible
girl
and
prepared
mentally
the
platitudes
he
would
utter
in
case
he
should
be
called
in
his
turn
but
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
she
came
back
out
of
breath
red
to
suffocation
exasperated
she
was
stammering
oh
la
canaille
la
canaille
note
from
brett
this
translates
roughly
into
oh
the
rogue
the
rogue
all
rushed
up
to
her
to
find
out
what
had
happened
but
she
did
not
say
anything
and
as
the
count
was
insisting
she
replied
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
no
it
does
not
concern
you
i
can
not
speak
then
they
took
their
seats
around
a
high
soup
tureen
from
which
issued
a
smell
of
cabbage
in
spite
of
this
untoward
incident
the
supper
was
cheerful
the
cider
was
good
the
loiseau
couple
and
the
sisters
drank
of
it
by
economy
the
others
ordered
wine
cornudet
called
for
a
bottle
of
beer
he
had
a
peculiar
way
of
uncorking
the
bottle
making
the
beer
foam
examining
it
as
he
inclined
his
glass
which
he
then
raised
between
the
lamp
and
his
eyes
in
order
to
appreciate
better
its
color
while
drinking
his
long
beard
that
had
kept
the
color
of
his
favorite
beverage
seemed
to
shake
with
joy
his
eyes
squinted
in
his
effort
not
to
lose
sight
of
his
glass
and
he
looked
as
if
he
were
performing
the
only
function
for
which
he
had
been
created
one
would
have
thought
that
in
his
mind
he
established
a
relationship
and
a
kind
of
affinity
between
the
two
great
passions
that
occupied
all
his
life
pale
ale
and
revolution
and
certainly
he
could
not
taste
the
former
without
dreaming
of
the
latter
and
follenvie
were
dining
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
man
rattling
like
a
broken
down
locomotive
was
too
short
winded
to
talk
while
eating
but
the
woman
never
kept
silent
she
told
all
her
impressions
on
the
arrival
of
the
prussians
what
they
did
what
they
said
execrating
them
first
because
they
cost
them
money
and
then
because
she
had
two
sons
in
the
army
she
spoke
especially
to
the
countess
flattered
at
the
opportunity
of
talking
with
a
lady
of
quality
then
she
lowered
her
voice
to
broach
delicate
subjects
and
her
husband
interrupted
her
now
and
then
you
better
hold
your
tongue
madame
follenvie
but
she
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
his
admonitions
and
continued
yes
madame
these
people
do
nothing
but
eat
potatoes
and
pork
and
again
pork
and
potatoes
and
you
must
not
think
that
they
are
clean
oh
no
indeed
not
they
soil
and
dirty
everything
permit
me
the
expression
and
if
you
saw
them
drill
for
hours
and
days
they
are
all
there
in
a
field
and
march
forward
and
march
backward
and
turn
this
way
and
turn
that
way
if
at
least
they
cultivated
the
land
or
worked
on
the
roads
in
their
country
but
no
madame
these
soldiers
are
good
for
nothing
what
a
pity
that
the
poor
people
should
toil
and
feed
them
and
they
should
learn
nothing
but
how
to
massacre
i
am
only
an
uneducated
old
woman
it
is
true
but
in
seeing
them
wear
themselves
out
by
marching
from
morning
till
night
i
say
to
myself
when
there
are
so
many
people
who
make
so
many
discoveries
to
serve
the
people
why
should
others
take
so
much
trouble
to
be
harmful
truly
is
it
not
abominable
to
kill
people
whether
they
are
prussians
or
english
or
polish
or
french
if
you
take
revenge
on
somebody
who
has
wronged
you
that
is
bad
enough
because
you
are
condemned
to
jail
but
when
our
boys
are
exterminated
like
game
with
guns
it
must
be
all
right
because
decorations
are
given
to
the
man
who
kills
the
most
no
indeed
i
shall
never
be
able
to
understand
it
cornudet
raised
his
voice
war
is
barbarous
when
you
attack
a
peaceful
neighbor
it
is
a
sacred
duty
when
waged
in
defense
of
one
country
the
old
woman
lowered
her
head
yes
in
it
is
another
matter
but
should
we
rather
kill
off
all
the
kings
who
go
to
war
for
their
own
pleasure
cornudet
eyes
flashed
bravo
citoyenne
said
he
note
from
brett
this
translates
roughly
into
citizen
was
in
deep
meditation
although
a
fanatical
admirer
of
illustrious
generals
the
common
sense
of
that
peasant
woman
made
him
think
of
the
opulence
that
would
bring
to
a
country
so
many
hands
now
idle
and
necessarily
ruinous
so
many
forces
kept
unproductive
if
they
were
employed
for
the
great
industrial
enterprises
which
at
the
present
pace
it
would
take
centuries
to
complete
but
loiseau
leaving
his
seat
went
and
spoke
in
a
very
low
voice
to
the
the
fat
man
was
laughing
coughing
and
expectorating
his
enormous
stomach
shook
with
merriment
at
the
jokes
of
his
neighbor
and
he
bought
from
him
six
casks
of
claret
to
be
delivered
in
the
spring
after
the
departure
of
the
prussians
hardly
were
they
through
with
supper
they
retired
as
they
were
all
tired
out
loiseau
however
who
had
kept
an
eye
on
what
was
going
on
send
his
wife
to
bed
then
he
pressed
now
his
ear
now
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
in
order
to
try
and
discover
what
he
called
the
mysteries
of
the
hall
after
about
an
hour
he
heard
a
rustle
peeped
out
quickly
and
saw
boule
de
suif
who
looked
still
more
corpulent
in
a
blue
cashmere
dressing
gown
trimmed
with
white
lace
she
held
a
candle
in
her
hand
and
made
straight
for
the
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
bearing
a
conspicuous
number
but
a
opened
and
when
after
a
few
minutes
she
came
back
cornudet
in
his
and
suspenders
was
following
her
boule
de
suif
seemed
to
deny
him
energetically
admission
to
her
room
unfortunately
loisseau
could
not
hear
what
they
said
but
in
the
end
as
they
raised
their
voices
he
was
able
to
catch
a
few
words
cornudet
was
insisting
eagerly
come
now
you
are
silly
what
does
it
matter
to
you
she
seemed
indignant
and
replied
no
my
friend
there
are
times
when
we
can
not
do
such
things
and
why
here
it
would
be
a
shame
apparently
he
failed
to
understand
and
asked
then
she
became
excited
and
speaking
louder
she
said
why
do
you
understand
why
when
prussians
are
in
the
house
maybe
in
the
next
room
he
had
a
newspaper
which
he
unfolded
on
his
knees
a
hussy
who
denied
herself
to
the
solicitations
of
a
man
while
they
were
near
the
enemy
must
have
aroused
in
his
heart
his
failing
dignity
for
after
having
kissed
her
he
went
back
stealthily
to
his
room
loiseau
quite
excited
left
the
keyhole
and
quickly
jumped
into
the
conjugal
bed
to
seek
solace
near
the
hard
carcass
of
his
espoused
then
the
whole
house
became
silent
but
soon
there
arose
from
somewhere
from
some
indeterminate
direction
which
might
have
been
the
cellar
as
well
as
the
attic
a
powerful
monotonous
snore
a
deep
and
prolonged
noise
like
the
throbbing
of
a
boiler
under
pressure
follenvie
was
sleeping
as
it
had
been
decided
that
they
would
start
at
eight
the
next
morning
at
that
hour
everybody
was
in
the
kitchen
but
the
coach
the
hood
of
which
formed
a
roof
of
snow
stood
solitary
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
without
horses
and
without
driver
in
vain
a
search
was
made
for
the
latter
in
the
stable
barns
and
then
all
the
men
decided
to
scour
the
country
and
they
set
out
they
found
themselves
in
the
square
with
the
church
at
the
farther
end
and
on
both
sides
low
houses
in
which
prussian
soldiers
could
be
seen
the
first
one
they
saw
was
peeling
potatoes
further
on
the
second
was
washing
the
barber
shop
another
bearded
up
to
his
eyes
was
kissing
a
crying
child
and
lulling
him
on
his
knees
to
quiet
it
fat
peasant
women
whose
husbands
were
in
the
fighting
army
were
showing
by
the
language
of
signs
to
their
obedient
conquerors
the
work
they
had
to
do
chop
wood
prepare
soup
grind
coffee
one
of
them
was
even
washing
for
his
hostess
an
impotent
grandmother
the
count
surprised
questioned
the
beadle
who
was
coming
out
of
the
presbytery
the
old
church
rat
replied
oh
those
here
are
not
bad
they
are
not
prussians
according
to
what
i
hear
they
come
from
farther
off
i
do
know
exactly
where
and
they
have
all
left
wives
and
children
at
home
they
are
not
so
fond
of
war
i
assure
you
i
am
positive
that
over
there
they
are
mourning
for
their
men
and
war
will
cause
them
much
distress
as
it
does
us
here
at
least
we
are
not
so
badly
off
for
the
present
because
the
soldiers
do
harm
us
and
they
work
as
if
they
were
in
their
own
houses
you
see
sir
we
poor
people
must
help
each
other
it
is
the
wealthy
ones
who
make
war
cornudet
indignant
at
the
cordial
understanding
established
between
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
went
away
preferring
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
inn
loiseau
cracked
a
joke
they
are
the
country
more
serious
interjected
they
are
repairing
but
they
could
not
find
the
driver
finally
they
discovered
him
in
the
village
café
fraternizing
and
drinking
with
the
orderly
of
the
prussian
officer
the
count
interpolated
did
you
have
orders
to
have
the
coach
ready
for
eight
oh
yes
but
i
have
received
other
orders
since
what
orders
not
to
harness
the
horses
at
all
who
gave
you
that
order
upon
my
faith
the
prussian
commander
why
i
do
know
go
and
ask
him
i
am
forbidden
to
harness
the
horses
and
i
do
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
did
he
tell
you
so
himself
no
sir
it
is
the
that
gave
me
the
order
for
him
when
did
he
give
it
last
night
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
the
three
men
became
quite
alarmed
they
called
for
monsieur
follenvie
but
the
servant
told
them
that
on
account
of
his
asthma
that
gentleman
never
got
up
before
ten
he
had
even
left
formal
orders
not
to
wake
him
up
earlier
except
in
case
of
fire
they
wanted
to
see
the
officer
but
it
was
absolutely
impossible
although
he
lodged
in
the
inn
follenvie
only
was
authorized
to
speak
to
him
about
civil
matters
then
they
waited
the
women
went
up
to
their
rooms
and
got
busy
with
their
trifles
cornudet
sat
down
and
made
himself
comfortable
in
front
of
the
high
fireplace
of
the
kitchen
in
which
a
big
fire
was
blazing
he
had
one
of
the
small
tables
of
the
café
brought
there
ordered
a
jug
of
beer
and
drew
out
his
pipe
which
among
the
democrats
enjoyed
a
consideration
almost
equal
to
his
own
as
if
it
had
served
the
country
in
serving
cornudet
it
was
a
superb
meerschaum
pipe
admirably
blackened
as
black
as
its
master
teeth
but
fragrant
nicely
curved
shining
familiar
to
his
hand
and
completing
his
physiognomy
and
he
remained
still
his
eyes
fixed
now
on
the
flame
of
the
fire
now
on
the
foam
crowning
his
jug
and
every
time
after
he
had
drunk
he
passed
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
his
thin
long
fingers
in
his
flowing
greasy
hair
while
he
sucked
his
mustache
fringed
with
foam
loiseau
under
pretence
of
stretching
his
legs
went
out
to
sell
wine
to
the
dealers
of
the
village
the
count
and
the
manufacturer
began
to
talk
politics
they
were
forecasting
france
future
the
one
kept
faith
in
the
orleans
dynasty
the
other
expected
an
unknown
savior
a
hero
who
would
rise
up
when
everything
was
desperate
a
duguseclin
a
jeanne
perhaps
or
another
napoleon
the
great
ah
if
the
imperial
prince
had
not
been
so
young
cornudet
listening
to
their
conversation
was
smiling
as
a
man
who
holds
the
keys
to
his
pipe
perfumed
the
whole
kitchen
as
it
was
striking
ten
follenvie
appeared
he
was
immediately
questioned
but
he
only
repeated
two
or
three
times
without
any
variation
the
following
words
the
officer
told
me
so
monsieur
follenvie
you
will
forbid
the
driver
to
harness
up
the
coach
of
these
travelers
morning
i
do
want
them
to
go
without
my
order
you
understand
that
is
enough
then
they
wanted
to
see
the
officer
the
count
sent
in
his
card
on
which
added
his
own
name
and
all
his
titles
the
prussian
sent
word
that
the
two
men
would
be
admitted
to
speak
to
him
after
he
had
had
his
luncheon
that
is
to
say
about
one
the
ladies
came
down
and
they
all
had
a
bite
in
spite
of
their
anxiety
boule
de
suif
seemed
to
be
sick
and
prodigiously
worried
they
were
finishing
their
coffee
when
the
orderly
came
to
call
the
gentlemen
loiseau
joined
the
first
two
but
as
they
tried
to
induce
cornudet
to
go
with
them
in
order
to
add
more
solemnity
to
their
application
he
declared
proudly
that
he
expected
not
to
have
any
intercourse
with
the
germans
and
he
resumed
his
seat
near
the
ordering
another
jug
of
beer
the
three
men
went
up
and
were
ushered
into
the
finest
room
of
the
inn
in
which
the
officer
received
them
stretched
on
an
armchair
his
feet
resting
on
the
mantelpiece
and
smoking
a
long
porcelain
pipe
wrapped
in
a
flamboyant
no
doubt
stolen
from
the
abandoned
residence
of
some
bourgeois
lacking
in
taste
he
did
not
get
up
neither
did
he
greet
them
nor
look
at
them
he
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
insolence
natural
to
victorious
soldiers
after
a
few
seconds
he
said
in
his
defective
french
what
do
you
want
the
count
spoke
we
wish
to
continue
our
journey
sir
no
may
i
inquire
what
is
the
reason
for
this
refusal
because
i
do
want
i
would
respectfully
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
sir
that
your
general
in
chief
has
delivered
us
a
permit
to
go
to
dieppe
and
i
do
think
we
did
anything
to
deserve
your
rigors
i
do
want
to
let
you
go
that
is
all
you
may
retire
having
bowed
all
three
retired
they
spent
a
wretched
afternoon
they
could
not
in
any
way
account
for
this
german
caprice
and
the
most
singular
ideas
worried
their
heads
everybody
stayed
in
the
kitchen
and
there
was
endless
discussion
imagining
the
most
unlikely
things
perhaps
they
wanted
to
hold
them
as
hostages
but
for
what
object
or
take
them
away
as
prisoners
or
rather
demand
from
them
a
large
ransom
at
this
thought
they
became
the
wealthiest
were
the
most
alarmed
seeing
themselves
already
compelled
in
order
to
redeem
their
lives
to
pour
bags
of
gold
into
the
hands
of
this
insolent
soldier
they
racked
their
brains
to
find
plausible
and
acceptable
lies
conceal
their
wealth
pass
themselves
off
as
very
poor
very
poor
loiseau
took
off
his
watch
and
chain
and
hid
it
in
his
pocket
the
approaching
night
filled
them
with
the
lamp
was
lighted
and
as
they
still
had
fully
two
hours
before
dinner
madame
loiseau
proposed
a
game
of
that
would
be
a
diversion
they
accepted
even
cornudet
having
put
out
his
pipe
joined
the
party
out
of
politeness
the
count
shuffled
the
cards
and
dealt
boule
de
suif
had
a
full
and
soon
the
interest
in
the
game
quieted
the
fears
that
were
haunting
the
minds
but
cornudet
noticed
that
the
loiseau
couple
had
arranged
to
cheat
as
they
were
going
to
sit
down
to
dinner
follenvie
reappeared
and
with
his
grating
voice
announced
the
prussian
officer
sends
me
to
ask
mlle
elizabeth
rousset
whether
she
has
changed
her
mind
boule
de
suif
stood
still
pale
as
death
then
turning
suddenly
crimson
she
felt
so
suffocated
by
anger
that
she
could
not
speak
finally
she
gasped
out
you
will
please
tell
that
scoundrel
that
rascal
that
carrion
of
a
prussian
that
i
shall
never
consent
you
understand
never
never
never
the
fat
went
away
then
boule
de
suif
was
surrounded
questioned
solicited
by
everybody
to
reveal
the
mystery
of
her
visit
first
she
resisted
but
soon
exasperation
got
the
best
of
what
he
wants
what
he
wants
he
wants
me
to
keep
company
with
him
she
exclaimed
nobody
was
shocked
by
this
revelation
so
great
was
their
indignation
cornudet
broke
his
jug
as
he
banged
it
down
on
the
table
there
was
a
general
clamor
of
reprobation
against
the
ignoble
soldier
a
waive
of
anger
a
combination
of
all
for
resistance
as
if
each
one
of
the
party
had
been
called
upon
to
make
the
sacrifice
demanded
of
boule
de
suif
the
count
declared
just
like
the
barbarians
in
ancient
times
the
women
specially
showed
boule
de
suif
an
affectionate
and
energetic
commiseration
the
good
sisters
who
showed
up
only
at
meal
time
had
bowed
their
heads
and
said
nothing
they
dined
however
as
soon
as
the
first
furor
had
abated
but
they
spoke
little
the
ladies
retired
early
and
the
men
while
smoking
organized
a
game
of
écarté
and
invited
follenvie
to
join
them
because
they
wanted
to
question
him
skillfully
as
to
the
means
to
be
used
to
overcome
the
officer
resistance
but
he
had
his
mind
concentrated
on
the
cards
he
did
not
hear
anything
did
not
answer
anything
and
kept
on
repeating
attend
to
the
game
gentlemen
attend
to
the
game
his
attention
was
so
tense
that
he
even
forgot
to
expectorate
which
produced
at
times
a
wheezing
in
his
chest
like
the
sounds
of
an
organ
his
whistling
lungs
gave
out
every
note
of
the
asthmatic
scale
from
the
deep
and
hollow
tones
up
to
the
shrill
crowing
of
young
roosters
trying
to
sing
he
even
refused
to
go
up
when
his
wife
overcome
with
sleep
came
to
get
him
then
she
went
away
all
alone
because
she
was
an
early
riser
getting
up
with
the
sun
whereas
her
husband
kept
late
hours
always
ready
to
spend
the
night
with
friends
he
called
to
her
put
my
eggnog
near
the
fire
and
continued
the
game
when
the
travelers
saw
that
they
could
not
get
anything
out
of
him
they
announced
that
it
was
time
to
retire
and
they
all
went
to
bed
they
rose
quite
early
again
the
next
morning
with
a
vague
hope
a
greater
desire
to
be
able
to
proceed
on
their
journey
and
a
dread
of
having
to
spend
another
day
in
this
wretched
little
inn
alas
the
horses
remained
in
the
stable
the
driver
was
invisible
having
nothing
better
to
do
they
went
and
wandered
around
the
coach
luncheon
was
very
gloomy
and
there
had
developed
a
general
coolness
toward
boule
de
suif
for
night
which
brings
counsel
had
somewhat
modified
their
judgment
they
almost
bore
a
grudge
against
the
girl
for
not
having
surreptitiously
gone
to
the
prussian
officer
to
afford
a
pleasant
surprise
to
her
companions
when
they
awoke
nothing
more
simple
beside
who
would
have
suspected
it
she
might
have
saved
appearances
by
having
the
officer
say
that
he
had
taken
pity
on
their
distress
to
her
it
would
have
been
of
little
consequence
but
nobody
as
yet
gave
expression
to
such
thoughts
in
the
afternoon
as
they
were
bored
to
death
the
count
proposed
to
take
a
walk
around
the
village
each
one
wrapped
himself
up
carefully
and
the
small
company
set
off
with
the
exception
of
cornudet
who
preferred
to
remain
by
the
fire
and
the
good
nuns
who
spent
their
days
in
church
or
at
the
parish
house
the
cold
growing
daily
more
and
more
intense
bit
mercilessly
the
nose
and
ears
of
the
strollers
their
feet
pained
them
so
much
that
each
step
was
a
torture
and
when
the
country
opened
up
before
them
it
looked
so
frightfully
dismal
under
the
boundless
sheet
of
white
that
they
all
retraced
their
steps
hastily
with
souls
frozen
and
hearts
heavy
the
four
women
walked
in
front
and
the
three
men
followed
them
a
little
behind
loiseau
who
understood
the
situation
very
clearly
inquired
suddenly
whether
that
wench
was
going
to
keep
them
much
longer
in
such
a
place
the
count
always
courteous
realized
that
they
could
not
expect
such
a
painful
sacrifice
from
a
woman
and
that
the
offer
should
originate
from
her
monsieur
remarked
that
if
the
french
undertook
as
it
was
rumored
a
by
way
of
dieppe
the
battle
would
certainly
be
fought
in
tôtes
this
remark
made
the
other
two
quite
anxious
how
about
trying
to
escape
on
foot
suggested
loiseau
the
count
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
is
out
of
the
question
in
this
snow
and
with
our
wives
and
furthermore
we
would
be
pursued
immediately
caught
in
ten
minutes
and
brought
back
as
prisoners
at
the
mercy
of
the
soldiers
that
was
true
there
was
silence
again
the
ladies
talked
toilette
but
a
certain
constraint
seemed
to
separate
them
suddenly
the
officer
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
street
on
the
snow
that
bound
the
horizon
his
tall
and
uniformed
figure
outlined
itself
he
walked
knees
apart
with
that
motion
particular
to
soldiers
who
are
anxious
not
to
soil
their
carefully
polished
boots
he
bowed
as
he
passed
the
ladies
and
looked
scornfully
at
the
men
who
it
must
be
said
to
their
credit
had
enough
dignity
not
to
raise
their
hats
although
loiseau
made
a
move
to
take
off
his
headgear
boule
de
suif
blushed
red
to
her
ears
and
the
three
married
women
felt
greatly
humiliated
to
have
been
met
by
the
officer
while
they
were
in
the
company
of
this
girl
whom
he
had
treated
so
unceremoniously
then
they
spoke
of
him
of
his
figure
and
his
face
madame
who
had
known
many
officers
and
who
judged
them
as
a
connoisseur
found
that
this
one
was
not
so
bad
looking
after
all
she
even
regretted
that
he
was
not
french
because
he
would
have
made
a
very
handsome
husband
with
whom
all
the
women
would
have
fallen
in
love
once
back
in
the
inn
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
even
acrid
words
were
exchanged
about
insignificant
matters
the
silent
dinner
did
not
last
long
and
each
went
upstairs
to
bed
in
the
hope
of
sleeping
the
time
away
the
next
morning
they
came
down
with
tired
faces
and
exasperated
tempers
the
women
hardly
spoke
to
boule
de
suif
a
church
bell
began
to
ring
it
was
for
a
baptism
boule
de
suif
had
a
child
being
brought
up
by
peasants
in
yvetot
she
did
not
see
it
even
once
a
year
and
never
gave
it
a
thought
but
the
idea
of
the
one
that
was
going
to
be
baptized
developed
a
sudden
and
violent
tenderness
for
her
own
and
she
insisted
absolutely
on
going
to
the
ceremony
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
those
who
remained
looked
at
each
other
and
drew
their
chairs
closer
for
they
felt
that
in
the
end
they
had
to
take
some
loiseau
had
an
inspiration
he
suggested
that
they
should
propose
to
the
officer
to
keep
boule
de
suif
only
and
let
the
others
go
follenvie
undertook
again
to
convey
the
message
but
he
came
down
almost
immediately
the
german
who
knew
human
nature
had
kicked
him
out
of
his
room
he
meant
to
keep
everybody
as
long
as
his
wishes
had
not
been
complied
with
then
the
vulgar
temper
of
madame
loiseau
broke
loose
and
yet
we
are
not
going
to
die
of
old
age
here
since
it
is
that
trade
to
carry
it
on
with
all
men
i
think
that
she
has
no
right
to
refuse
one
rather
than
another
imagine
she
has
taken
all
that
she
found
in
rouen
even
coachmen
yes
madame
the
coachman
of
the
prefecture
i
know
it
for
a
fact
because
he
buys
his
wine
of
us
and
now
that
it
is
a
question
of
getting
us
out
of
trouble
she
is
putting
on
virtuous
airs
the
drab
i
find
that
the
officer
behaves
very
well
possibly
he
may
have
abstained
for
a
long
time
and
here
we
are
three
of
us
whom
he
certainly
would
have
preferred
but
no
he
is
satisfied
with
the
girl
who
is
public
property
he
respects
married
women
think
of
it
he
is
the
master
here
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
to
say
want
and
he
might
have
taken
us
by
force
with
the
aid
of
his
soldiers
the
two
other
women
shuddered
slightly
the
eyes
of
pretty
madame
sparkled
and
she
grew
a
little
pale
as
if
she
felt
herself
already
taken
by
force
by
the
officer
the
men
who
were
arguing
among
themselves
came
near
them
loiseau
excited
wanted
to
deliver
up
that
miserable
woman
bound
hand
and
foot
to
the
enemy
but
the
count
descended
from
three
generations
of
ambassadors
and
endowed
with
the
physique
of
a
diplomat
was
advocating
more
tactfulness
and
persuasion
we
should
persuade
her
said
he
then
they
conspired
the
women
drew
close
to
each
other
the
tone
of
their
voices
was
lowered
and
the
discussion
became
general
each
giving
her
opinion
it
was
most
correct
besides
the
ladies
specially
found
delicate
euphemisms
charming
subtleties
of
expression
to
say
the
most
shocking
things
a
stranger
would
have
understood
nothing
so
well
were
the
precautions
of
language
observed
but
as
the
thin
veneer
of
pudor
with
which
every
society
woman
is
provided
covers
only
the
surface
they
showed
their
real
selves
in
this
wretched
adventure
and
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
enjoying
themselves
immensely
feeling
themselves
in
their
element
handling
love
with
the
sensuousness
of
a
gourmand
cook
who
prepares
supper
for
somebody
else
note
from
brett
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
though
unintentional
pun
pudor
is
spanish
for
shame
but
this
meaning
makes
the
sentence
difficult
to
read
at
best
although
it
does
convey
the
intent
i
think
that
the
word
intended
is
powder
but
left
the
original
in
case
i
am
wrong
their
gaiety
came
back
of
itself
so
amusing
after
all
did
the
whole
incident
seem
to
them
the
count
found
rather
risky
witticisms
but
so
cleverly
told
that
they
provoked
smiles
in
his
turn
loiseau
fired
some
broader
jokes
which
did
not
shock
the
listeners
and
the
thought
brutally
expressed
by
his
wife
preponderated
in
every
one
mind
since
it
is
her
business
why
should
the
girl
refuse
this
man
rather
than
another
the
pretty
mme
seemed
even
inclined
to
think
that
in
her
place
she
would
refuse
this
one
less
than
any
other
the
blockade
was
carefully
prepared
as
if
they
were
besieging
a
fortress
each
agreed
to
play
the
part
assigned
to
him
or
her
the
arguments
to
be
used
the
maneuvers
to
be
executed
they
decided
on
the
plan
of
attack
the
stratagems
and
the
surprise
assault
to
be
attempted
in
order
to
compel
this
living
citadel
to
receive
the
enemy
cornudet
however
remained
apart
completely
unwilling
to
participate
in
this
plot
the
minds
were
so
tensely
absorbed
in
this
scheme
that
nobody
heard
boule
de
suif
coming
in
but
the
count
whispered
a
gentle
hush
which
caused
all
eyes
to
look
up
there
she
stood
there
was
a
sudden
silence
and
a
certain
embarrassment
prevented
them
first
from
speaking
to
her
the
countess
having
more
than
the
others
the
habit
of
duplicities
questioned
her
was
the
baptism
interesting
the
girl
still
laboring
under
her
emotion
told
everything
described
the
faces
the
attitudes
and
even
the
appearance
of
the
church
she
added
it
does
one
so
much
good
to
pray
sometimes
however
until
lunch
time
the
ladies
confined
themselves
to
being
nice
to
her
with
a
view
to
make
her
feel
more
confident
and
amenable
to
their
advances
as
soon
as
they
sat
down
to
luncheon
the
preliminary
attack
was
initiated
it
was
at
first
a
vague
discussion
about
they
quoted
instances
from
ancient
history
such
as
judith
and
holophern
then
without
any
reason
lucretia
with
sextus
cleopatra
who
admitted
to
her
intimacy
all
the
enemy
generals
and
reduced
them
to
slavish
servility
then
a
fancy
history
was
propounded
originating
in
the
imagination
of
those
ignorant
millionaires
and
according
to
which
roman
matrons
used
to
go
to
capua
and
lull
hannibal
in
their
arms
and
with
him
his
lieutenants
and
the
phalanxes
of
his
mercenaries
they
quoted
all
the
women
who
had
stopped
conquerors
converted
their
bodies
into
battlefields
a
means
of
conquest
a
weapon
who
by
their
heroic
caresses
had
vanquished
frightful
and
execrated
beings
and
had
sacrificed
their
chastity
to
vengeance
and
patriotic
devotion
they
even
spoke
in
veiled
terms
of
that
english
lady
of
noble
family
who
had
allowed
herself
to
be
inoculated
with
a
horrid
and
contagious
disease
which
she
wanted
to
communicate
to
bonaparte
and
how
the
latter
had
been
miraculously
saved
by
a
sudden
faintness
during
the
fatal
appointment
and
all
this
was
told
without
overstepping
the
bounds
of
propriety
and
moderation
with
her
and
there
a
studied
manifestation
of
enthusiasm
intended
to
provoke
emulation
in
the
end
one
would
have
been
led
to
believe
that
the
only
mission
of
woman
on
this
earth
was
a
perpetual
sacrifice
of
her
person
a
continual
offering
of
herself
to
the
caprices
of
enemy
soldiers
the
two
nuns
did
not
seem
to
hear
this
conversation
lost
as
they
were
in
their
own
deep
thoughts
boule
de
suif
was
silent
the
whole
afternoon
she
was
left
to
herself
but
instead
of
calling
her
madame
as
they
had
done
so
far
they
addressed
her
as
mademoiselle
nobody
knew
why
as
if
they
wanted
to
lower
her
one
step
in
their
esteem
which
she
had
escaladed
and
make
her
feel
her
shameful
situation
while
soup
was
being
served
follenvie
reappeared
and
repeated
his
sentence
of
the
day
before
the
prussian
officer
sends
me
to
inquire
whether
mademoiselle
elizabeth
rousset
has
not
yet
changed
her
mind
boule
de
suif
replied
curtly
no
sir
but
at
dinner
the
coalition
weakened
loiseau
spoke
three
unfortunate
sentences
each
was
racking
his
brains
to
find
new
examples
and
did
not
find
any
when
the
countess
possibly
without
premeditation
prompted
by
a
vague
desire
to
render
homage
to
religion
questioned
the
elder
of
the
two
nuns
about
the
most
noteworthy
deeds
in
the
lives
of
the
now
many
saints
had
committed
acts
which
would
be
crimes
in
our
estimation
but
the
church
absolves
readily
such
transgressions
when
they
are
committed
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
love
of
our
neighbors
this
was
a
powerful
argument
the
countess
made
the
most
of
it
then
either
by
one
of
those
tacit
understandings
those
veiled
complaisances
in
which
whoever
wears
the
clerical
garb
excels
or
through
fortunate
stupidity
serviable
foolishness
the
old
nun
brought
a
formidable
support
to
the
conspiracy
they
thought
she
was
timid
she
showed
herself
bold
talkative
violent
this
one
was
not
trouble
by
the
hesitations
of
casuistry
her
doctrine
seemed
to
be
an
iron
bar
her
faith
never
hesitated
her
conscience
had
no
scruples
she
found
quite
natural
abraham
sacrifice
because
she
would
immediately
have
killed
her
father
and
mother
if
she
had
received
an
order
from
heaven
to
do
so
and
in
her
opinion
nothing
could
displease
god
if
the
motive
were
laudable
the
countess
taking
advantage
of
the
sacred
authority
of
her
unexpected
accomplice
led
her
on
to
make
a
kind
of
edifying
paraphrase
of
this
axiom
of
morality
the
end
justifies
the
means
she
questioned
her
then
sister
you
think
that
god
accepts
all
methods
and
forgives
the
act
when
the
motive
is
pure
who
could
doubt
it
madame
an
action
condemnable
in
itself
often
becomes
meritorious
by
the
thought
which
inspires
it
and
they
continued
in
this
way
unraveling
god
intentions
forecasting
his
judgments
and
making
him
take
interest
in
things
that
really
did
not
concern
him
at
all
all
this
was
expounded
in
a
veiled
clever
discreet
and
insinuating
manner
but
each
word
of
the
holy
woman
in
cornet
made
a
breach
in
the
indignant
resistance
of
the
courtesan
then
the
conversation
drifting
somewhat
the
woman
with
the
hanging
rosary
spoke
of
the
convents
of
her
order
of
her
superior
of
herself
and
of
her
lovely
neighbor
the
dear
sister
they
had
been
called
to
havre
to
nurse
in
the
hospitals
hundreds
of
soldiers
stricken
with
she
described
them
those
wretched
victims
and
gave
details
about
their
disease
and
while
they
had
been
stopped
on
their
way
by
the
caprices
of
this
prussian
officer
a
large
number
of
frenchmen
whom
they
would
probably
have
saved
might
die
it
was
her
specialty
to
nurse
soldiers
she
had
been
in
crimea
in
italy
in
austria
and
telling
the
story
of
her
campaigns
she
unexpectedly
revealed
herself
one
of
those
nuns
fond
of
drums
and
bugles
who
seem
to
have
been
created
to
follow
the
armies
in
action
to
pick
soldiers
during
the
vicissitudes
of
battles
and
better
than
a
general
to
tame
with
one
word
the
rough
and
insubordinate
troopers
a
genuine
martial
and
bellicose
nun
whose
wrinkled
and
pitted
face
looked
like
an
image
of
the
devastations
of
war
no
one
uttered
a
word
after
she
had
concluded
so
excellent
seemed
to
be
the
effect
of
her
discourse
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
they
went
up
quickly
to
their
rooms
and
came
down
the
next
morning
rather
late
luncheon
went
off
quietly
they
were
giving
the
seed
that
had
been
sown
time
to
germinate
and
come
to
fruition
the
countess
proposed
to
take
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
then
the
count
as
previously
agreed
offered
his
arm
to
boule
de
suif
and
walked
with
her
at
some
distance
behind
he
spoke
to
her
in
that
familiar
paternal
and
slightly
contemptuous
tone
which
sedate
men
assume
when
talking
with
women
of
loose
morals
calling
her
my
dear
child
treating
her
from
the
height
of
his
social
position
his
unquestionable
honesty
he
went
straight
to
the
core
of
the
matter
so
you
prefer
to
leave
us
here
exposed
like
yourself
to
all
the
violence
which
would
result
from
a
defeat
of
the
prussian
army
rather
than
consent
to
one
of
those
complaisances
which
you
have
had
so
often
in
your
life
boule
de
suif
did
not
answer
he
tried
kindness
reasoning
sentiment
he
managed
to
remain
monsieur
le
comte
even
while
showing
himself
gallant
when
necessary
flattering
amiable
he
praised
to
exaltation
the
services
she
would
render
them
spoke
of
their
gratitude
then
suddenly
using
the
familiar
thou
gaily
and
thou
knowest
my
dear
he
might
be
proud
of
having
tasted
the
charms
of
a
pretty
girl
such
as
he
wo
find
often
in
his
own
country
boule
de
suif
did
not
reply
and
joined
the
rest
of
the
party
as
soon
as
they
returned
to
the
inn
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
was
not
seen
again
there
was
extreme
anxiety
what
was
she
going
to
do
if
she
resisted
what
an
embarrassment
for
them
all
the
dinner
hour
struck
they
waited
for
her
in
vain
then
follenvie
came
in
and
announced
that
mademoiselle
rousset
did
not
feel
well
and
that
they
might
sit
down
to
dinner
they
all
pricked
their
ears
the
count
came
near
the
and
whispered
is
it
all
right
yes
for
the
sake
of
propriety
he
did
not
say
anything
to
his
companions
but
nodded
to
them
slightly
immediately
a
great
sigh
of
relief
went
up
from
all
breasts
joy
brightened
every
face
loiseau
exclaimed
by
jove
i
treat
to
champagne
if
any
is
left
in
this
house
and
madame
loiseau
felt
a
pang
when
the
returned
with
four
bottles
in
his
hand
every
one
had
suddenly
become
communicative
and
merry
a
lively
joy
filled
the
hearts
the
count
seemed
to
notice
that
madame
was
charming
the
manufacturer
paid
compliments
to
the
countess
the
conversation
was
lively
gay
and
full
of
witticisms
suddenly
loiseau
with
an
alarmed
face
raised
his
arms
and
shouted
silence
they
all
stopped
talking
were
surprised
nay
even
frightened
then
he
listened
said
hush
signaling
with
his
two
hands
raised
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
listened
again
and
in
his
natural
voice
he
resumed
do
be
afraid
everything
is
all
right
they
hesitated
to
understand
what
he
meant
but
soon
a
smile
lighted
up
all
the
faces
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
started
again
the
same
farce
and
repeated
it
often
during
the
evening
he
mimicked
as
if
he
were
calling
a
person
on
the
second
floor
and
giving
her
equivocal
advices
drawn
from
his
imagination
of
a
commercial
traveler
at
times
he
assumed
a
dismal
air
and
sighed
poor
girl
or
he
muttered
in
his
teeth
with
a
peevish
air
rascal
of
a
prussian
several
times
when
the
others
did
not
think
of
it
he
called
out
repeatedly
in
a
vibrating
voice
enough
enough
and
he
added
as
if
soliloquizing
provided
that
we
see
her
again
and
that
the
wretch
does
not
kill
her
although
such
jokes
were
in
very
bad
taste
they
amused
more
than
they
shocked
the
company
for
indignation
like
everything
else
depends
on
environment
and
the
atmosphere
that
had
gradually
developed
around
them
was
laden
with
naughty
thoughts
at
dessert
even
the
women
indulged
in
witty
and
discreet
allusions
their
eyes
were
bright
and
gleaming
they
had
drunk
considerably
the
count
who
even
in
his
moments
of
relaxation
preserved
a
dignified
appearance
found
a
comparison
with
the
end
of
winter
in
the
polar
regions
and
the
joy
of
the
mariners
when
they
see
a
way
open
to
the
south
and
this
comparison
was
greatly
appreciated
loiseau
warmed
up
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
glass
of
champagne
in
his
hands
i
drink
to
our
deliverance
everybody
stood
up
he
was
acclaimed
even
the
two
good
sisters
urged
by
the
ladies
consented
to
moisten
their
lips
with
the
sparkling
wine
which
they
had
never
tasted
they
declared
that
it
tasted
like
sparkling
lemonade
but
that
it
was
finer
loiseau
summed
up
the
situation
what
a
pity
that
there
is
no
piano
we
might
have
danced
a
quadrille
cornudet
had
not
said
a
single
word
nor
made
a
single
gesture
he
even
seemed
to
be
plunged
in
very
serious
thoughts
and
from
time
to
time
tugged
furiously
at
his
long
beard
as
if
he
wanted
to
make
it
longer
finally
toward
midnight
as
they
were
going
to
separate
loiseau
who
was
unsteady
on
his
feet
slapped
him
suddenly
on
the
stomach
and
spluttered
you
are
not
in
a
gay
mood
you
do
talk
much
citoyen
but
cornudet
raised
briskly
his
head
and
casting
a
swift
and
terrible
look
at
the
company
fairly
shouted
i
tell
you
all
that
you
have
behaved
infamously
he
got
up
walked
to
the
door
and
repeated
once
more
infamous
and
he
disappeared
this
threw
a
chill
at
first
loiseau
nonplused
stood
looking
foolish
but
he
recovered
his
countenance
and
then
suddenly
began
to
laugh
and
repeat
sour
grapes
my
dear
sir
sour
grapes
the
company
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
he
explained
the
mysteries
of
the
hall
then
there
was
a
resumption
of
formidable
gayety
the
ladies
were
immensely
amused
the
count
and
laughed
to
tears
they
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
why
are
you
sure
he
wanted
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
she
refused
because
the
prussian
was
in
the
next
room
is
it
possible
i
swear
it
is
true
the
count
was
choking
with
laughter
the
manufacturer
was
compressing
his
stomach
with
his
hands
and
you
understand
he
does
not
think
it
is
funny
at
all
and
all
three
began
to
laugh
again
choking
out
of
breath
thereupon
they
retired
but
madame
loiseau
who
had
the
prickly
disposition
of
a
nettle
remarked
to
her
husband
at
the
moment
they
were
going
to
bed
that
little
madame
laughed
deceitfully
all
evening
you
know
for
women
when
they
chase
uniforms
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
uniforms
are
french
or
prussian
what
a
pity
oh
lord
and
all
night
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
there
were
light
sounds
like
tremors
hardly
audible
similar
to
murmurs
contacts
of
bare
feet
imperceptible
crackings
and
they
fell
asleep
quite
late
certainly
because
rays
of
light
could
be
seen
for
a
long
time
under
the
doors
champagne
has
such
effects
i
understand
it
disturbs
the
sleep
the
next
morning
a
bright
winter
sunshine
made
the
snow
dazzling
the
coach
finally
harnessed
was
waiting
at
the
door
while
an
army
of
white
pigeons
ensconced
in
their
white
feathers
with
their
pink
eyes
spotted
in
the
middle
with
small
black
dots
were
walking
leisurely
between
the
legs
of
the
six
horses
and
picking
their
food
from
the
steaming
manure
which
they
were
scattering
the
driver
wrapped
up
in
his
sheepskin
cloak
was
up
on
his
seat
smoking
a
pipe
and
all
the
travelers
looking
radiant
were
having
provisions
packed
up
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
boule
de
suif
only
had
not
come
down
she
appeared
she
seemed
to
be
rather
confused
bashful
shyly
she
walked
up
to
her
companions
who
all
with
the
same
movement
turned
away
from
her
as
if
they
had
not
seen
her
the
count
dignified
took
his
wife
by
the
arm
and
removed
her
from
this
impure
contact
the
girl
stood
still
stupefied
then
picking
up
all
her
courage
she
accosted
the
manufacturer
wife
with
a
good
morning
madame
humbly
muttered
the
other
answered
only
with
a
short
and
impertinent
nod
accompanied
by
a
look
of
outraged
virtue
everybody
seemed
to
be
busy
and
kept
away
from
her
as
if
she
were
carrying
some
infectious
germs
in
her
skirt
then
they
rushed
up
to
the
coach
in
which
she
entered
last
without
being
helped
by
anyone
and
silently
she
took
the
seat
she
had
occupied
during
the
final
part
of
the
journey
they
feigned
not
to
see
her
not
to
know
her
but
mme
loiseau
looking
at
her
indignantly
from
a
distance
told
her
husband
half
aloud
fortunately
i
am
not
sitting
next
to
her
the
heavy
coach
started
and
the
journey
was
resumed
first
nobody
spoke
boule
de
suif
did
not
dare
raise
her
eyes
at
the
same
time
she
felt
indignant
at
all
her
companions
and
humiliated
for
having
yielded
to
the
prussian
officer
into
whose
arms
she
had
been
hypocritically
forced
by
them
but
the
countess
turning
to
madame
broke
soon
this
painful
silence
i
think
you
knew
madame
yes
she
is
one
of
my
friends
what
a
charming
woman
fascinating
really
a
select
nature
besides
highly
educated
and
an
artist
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
she
sings
delightfully
and
paints
to
perfection
the
manufacturer
was
talking
with
the
count
and
in
the
middle
of
the
clatter
of
the
one
could
catch
here
and
there
a
word
coupon
maturity
premium
term
loiseau
who
had
stolen
from
the
inn
the
old
pack
of
cards
greasy
after
five
years
friction
on
dirty
tables
started
a
game
of
bezigue
with
his
wife
the
good
sisters
took
from
their
belts
the
long
rosaries
made
simultaneously
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
suddenly
their
lips
began
to
move
rapidly
becoming
more
and
more
accelerated
precipitating
their
vague
murmur
as
if
in
a
race
of
orisons
and
now
and
then
they
kissed
a
medal
crossed
themselves
again
and
resumed
their
swift
and
continuous
mutterings
cornudet
sat
still
and
deep
in
thoughts
after
they
had
traveled
for
three
hours
loiseau
picked
up
his
cards
and
said
i
am
hungry
then
his
wife
reached
out
for
a
package
from
which
she
drew
a
piece
of
cold
veal
she
cut
it
carefully
in
thin
and
neat
slices
and
both
began
to
eat
why
should
we
do
the
same
said
the
countess
upon
general
consent
she
unpacked
the
provisions
prepared
for
the
two
couples
in
one
of
those
oval
dishes
the
cover
of
which
bears
a
china
hare
to
show
that
a
hare
pie
lies
inside
there
were
exquisite
delicatessen
the
white
streams
of
lard
crossing
the
brown
meat
of
the
game
mixed
with
other
fine
chopped
meats
a
handsome
piece
of
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
had
taken
on
its
fat
surface
the
imprint
sundry
items
the
two
sisters
opened
a
hunk
of
sausage
which
smelled
of
garlic
and
cornudet
plunging
at
the
same
time
both
his
hands
in
the
large
pockets
of
his
baggy
overcoat
drew
from
one
four
eggs
and
from
the
other
the
crust
of
a
loaf
of
bread
he
removed
the
shells
threw
them
under
his
feet
on
the
straw
and
began
to
bite
the
eggs
voraciously
dropping
on
his
large
beard
small
pieces
of
yellowish
yolk
which
looked
like
stars
boule
de
suif
in
the
haste
and
confusion
of
her
departure
had
not
thought
of
taking
provisions
and
exasperated
suffocating
with
rage
she
was
looking
on
all
those
people
who
ate
heartily
at
first
a
tumultuous
anger
shook
her
and
she
opened
her
mouth
to
tell
them
what
she
thought
of
them
in
a
wave
of
insults
that
surged
to
her
lips
but
she
could
not
speak
so
exasperated
was
she
with
indignation
nobody
looked
at
her
took
notice
of
her
she
felt
drowned
in
the
scorn
of
those
honest
rascals
who
had
first
sacrificed
her
and
then
cast
her
away
like
something
unclean
and
of
no
further
use
then
she
thought
of
her
large
basket
full
of
good
things
which
they
had
devoured
greedily
of
her
two
chickens
shining
in
jelly
her
pastry
her
pears
her
four
bottles
of
claret
and
suddenly
her
furor
having
died
out
like
an
over
strung
cord
she
felt
like
crying
she
made
terrible
efforts
stiffened
herself
up
swallowed
her
sobs
like
children
but
the
tears
were
surging
shining
at
the
border
of
her
eyelids
and
soon
two
big
tears
breaking
away
from
her
eyes
coursed
slowly
down
her
cheeks
others
followed
them
more
swiftly
running
like
drops
of
water
filtering
through
rocks
and
fell
regularly
on
the
rounded
curve
of
her
bosom
she
remained
upright
her
eyes
motionless
her
face
rigid
and
pale
hoping
that
the
others
would
not
notice
her
but
the
countess
noticed
it
and
called
her
husband
attention
with
a
sign
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
to
say
what
can
i
do
it
is
not
my
fault
madame
loiseau
had
a
silent
laugh
of
triumph
and
muttered
she
is
weeping
for
shame
the
two
good
sisters
had
resumed
their
prayers
after
having
rolled
up
in
a
paper
the
rest
of
their
sausage
then
cornudet
who
was
digesting
the
eggs
stretched
his
long
legs
under
the
seat
sat
back
crossed
his
arms
smiled
like
a
man
who
has
thought
of
a
good
joke
and
began
to
whistle
the
marseillaise
the
faces
of
all
the
others
darkened
decidedly
the
popular
song
did
not
please
his
neighbors
they
became
nervous
fidgety
and
seemed
ready
to
howl
like
dogs
that
hear
a
he
noticed
it
did
not
stop
at
times
he
even
pronounced
the
words
amour
sacré
del
la
patrie
conduis
soutiens
nos
bras
vengeurs
liberté
liberté
chérie
combats
avec
tes
défenseurs
the
snow
being
harder
the
coach
traveled
more
quickly
and
as
far
as
dieppe
during
the
long
dreary
hours
of
the
trip
through
the
jostles
of
the
road
during
the
twilight
and
later
in
the
thick
darkness
of
the
coach
he
kept
on
with
a
fierce
obstinacy
his
monotonous
and
revengeful
whistling
compelling
the
fagged
and
exasperated
hearers
to
follow
the
anthem
from
one
end
to
the
other
to
remember
every
word
that
went
with
each
measure
and
boule
de
suif
was
still
weeping
and
at
times
a
sob
which
she
could
not
restrain
passed
between
two
verses
in
the
night
finis
