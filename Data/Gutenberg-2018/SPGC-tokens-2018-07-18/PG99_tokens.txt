my
escape
from
slavery
in
the
first
narrative
of
my
experience
in
slavery
written
nearly
forty
years
ago
and
in
various
writings
since
i
have
given
the
public
what
i
considered
very
good
reasons
for
withholding
the
manner
of
my
escape
in
substance
these
reasons
were
first
that
such
publication
at
any
time
during
the
existence
of
slavery
might
be
used
by
the
master
against
the
slave
and
prevent
the
future
escape
of
any
who
might
adopt
the
same
means
that
i
did
the
second
reason
was
if
possible
still
more
binding
to
silence
the
publication
of
details
would
certainly
have
put
in
peril
the
persons
and
property
of
those
who
assisted
murder
itself
was
not
more
sternly
and
certainly
punished
in
the
state
of
maryland
than
that
of
aiding
and
abetting
the
escape
of
a
slave
many
colored
men
for
no
other
crime
than
that
of
giving
aid
to
a
fugitive
slave
have
like
charles
torrey
perished
in
prison
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
my
native
state
and
throughout
the
country
and
the
lapse
of
time
render
the
caution
hitherto
observed
no
longer
necessary
but
even
since
the
abolition
of
slavery
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
well
enough
to
baffle
curiosity
by
saying
that
while
slavery
existed
there
were
good
reasons
for
not
telling
the
manner
of
my
escape
and
since
slavery
had
ceased
to
exist
there
was
no
reason
for
telling
it
i
shall
now
however
cease
to
avail
myself
of
this
formula
and
as
far
as
i
can
endeavor
to
satisfy
this
very
natural
curiosity
i
should
perhaps
have
yielded
to
that
feeling
sooner
had
there
been
anything
very
heroic
or
thrilling
in
the
incidents
connected
with
my
escape
for
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
nothing
of
that
sort
to
tell
and
yet
the
courage
that
could
risk
betrayal
and
the
bravery
which
was
ready
to
encounter
death
if
need
be
in
pursuit
of
freedom
were
essential
features
in
the
undertaking
my
success
was
due
to
address
rather
than
courage
to
good
luck
rather
than
bravery
my
means
of
escape
were
provided
for
me
by
the
very
men
who
were
making
laws
to
hold
and
bind
me
more
securely
in
slavery
it
was
the
custom
in
the
state
of
maryland
to
require
the
free
colored
people
to
have
what
were
called
free
papers
these
instruments
they
were
required
to
renew
very
often
and
by
charging
a
fee
for
this
writing
considerable
sums
from
time
to
time
were
collected
by
the
state
in
these
papers
the
name
age
color
height
and
form
of
the
freeman
were
described
together
with
any
scars
or
other
marks
upon
his
person
which
could
assist
in
his
identification
this
device
in
some
measure
defeated
itself
since
more
than
one
man
could
be
found
to
answer
the
same
general
description
hence
many
slaves
could
escape
by
personating
the
owner
of
one
set
of
papers
and
this
was
often
done
as
follows
a
slave
nearly
or
sufficiently
answering
the
description
set
forth
in
the
papers
would
borrow
or
hire
them
till
by
means
of
them
he
could
escape
to
a
free
state
and
then
by
mail
or
otherwise
would
return
them
to
the
owner
the
operation
was
a
hazardous
one
for
the
lender
as
well
as
for
the
borrower
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
fugitive
to
send
back
the
papers
would
imperil
his
benefactor
and
the
discovery
of
the
papers
in
possession
of
the
wrong
man
would
imperil
both
the
fugitive
and
his
friend
it
was
therefore
an
act
of
supreme
trust
on
the
part
of
a
freeman
of
color
thus
to
put
in
jeopardy
his
own
liberty
that
another
might
be
free
it
was
however
not
unfrequently
bravely
done
and
was
seldom
discovered
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
resemble
any
of
my
free
acquaintances
sufficiently
to
answer
the
description
of
their
papers
but
i
had
a
friend
a
sailor
who
owned
a
sailor
protection
which
answered
somewhat
the
purpose
of
free
papers
describing
his
person
and
certifying
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
free
american
sailor
the
instrument
had
at
its
head
the
american
eagle
which
gave
it
the
appearance
at
once
of
an
authorized
document
this
protection
when
in
my
hands
did
not
describe
its
bearer
very
accurately
indeed
it
called
for
a
man
much
darker
than
myself
and
close
examination
of
it
would
have
caused
my
arrest
at
the
start
in
order
to
avoid
this
fatal
scrutiny
on
the
part
of
railroad
officials
i
arranged
with
isaac
rolls
a
baltimore
hackman
to
bring
my
baggage
to
the
philadelphia
train
just
on
the
moment
of
starting
and
jumped
upon
the
car
myself
when
the
train
was
in
motion
had
i
gone
into
the
station
and
offered
to
purchase
a
ticket
i
should
have
been
instantly
and
carefully
examined
and
undoubtedly
arrested
in
choosing
this
plan
i
considered
the
jostle
of
the
train
and
the
natural
haste
of
the
conductor
in
a
train
crowded
with
passengers
and
relied
upon
my
skill
and
address
in
playing
the
sailor
as
described
in
my
protection
to
do
the
rest
one
element
in
my
favor
was
the
kind
feeling
which
prevailed
in
baltimore
and
other
at
the
time
toward
those
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
free
trade
and
sailors
rights
just
then
expressed
the
sentiment
of
the
country
in
my
clothing
i
was
rigged
out
in
sailor
style
i
had
on
a
red
shirt
and
a
tarpaulin
hat
and
a
black
cravat
tied
in
sailor
fashion
carelessly
and
loosely
about
my
neck
my
knowledge
of
ships
and
sailor
talk
came
much
to
my
assistance
for
i
knew
a
ship
from
stem
to
stern
and
from
keelson
to
and
could
talk
sailor
like
an
old
salt
i
was
well
on
the
way
to
havre
de
grace
before
the
conductor
came
into
the
negro
car
to
collect
tickets
and
examine
the
papers
of
his
black
passengers
this
was
a
critical
moment
in
the
drama
my
whole
future
depended
upon
the
decision
of
this
conductor
agitated
though
i
was
while
this
ceremony
was
proceeding
still
externally
at
least
i
was
apparently
calm
and
he
went
on
with
his
duty
examining
several
colored
passengers
before
reaching
me
he
was
somewhat
harsh
in
tome
and
peremptory
in
manner
until
he
reached
me
when
strange
enough
and
to
my
surprise
and
relief
his
whole
manner
changed
seeing
that
i
did
not
readily
produce
my
free
papers
as
the
other
colored
persons
in
the
car
had
done
he
said
to
me
in
friendly
contrast
with
his
bearing
toward
the
others
i
suppose
you
have
your
free
papers
to
which
i
answered
no
sir
i
never
carry
my
free
papers
to
sea
with
me
but
you
have
something
to
show
that
you
are
a
freeman
have
you
yes
sir
i
answered
i
have
a
paper
with
the
american
eagle
on
it
and
that
will
carry
me
around
the
world
with
this
i
drew
from
my
deep
sailor
pocket
my
seaman
protection
as
before
described
the
merest
glance
at
the
paper
satisfied
him
and
he
took
my
fare
and
went
on
about
his
business
this
moment
of
time
was
one
of
the
most
anxious
i
ever
experienced
had
the
conductor
looked
closely
at
the
paper
he
could
not
have
failed
to
discover
that
it
called
for
a
very
person
from
myself
and
in
that
case
it
would
have
been
his
duty
to
arrest
me
on
the
instant
and
send
me
back
to
baltimore
from
the
first
station
when
he
left
me
with
the
assurance
that
i
was
all
right
though
much
relieved
i
realized
that
i
was
still
in
great
danger
i
was
still
in
maryland
and
subject
to
arrest
at
any
moment
i
saw
on
the
train
several
persons
who
would
have
known
me
in
any
other
clothes
and
i
feared
they
might
recognize
me
even
in
my
sailor
rig
and
report
me
to
the
conductor
who
would
then
subject
me
to
a
closer
examination
which
i
knew
well
would
be
fatal
to
me
though
i
was
not
a
murderer
fleeing
from
justice
i
felt
perhaps
quite
as
miserable
as
such
a
criminal
the
train
was
moving
at
a
very
high
rate
of
speed
for
that
epoch
of
railroad
travel
but
to
my
anxious
mind
it
was
moving
far
too
slowly
minutes
were
hours
and
hours
were
days
during
this
part
of
my
flight
after
maryland
i
was
to
pass
through
delaware
another
slave
state
where
generally
awaited
their
prey
for
it
was
not
in
the
interior
of
the
state
but
on
its
borders
that
these
human
hounds
were
most
vigilant
and
active
the
border
lines
between
slavery
and
freedom
were
the
dangerous
ones
for
the
fugitives
the
heart
of
no
fox
or
deer
with
hungry
hounds
on
his
trail
in
full
chase
could
have
beaten
more
anxiously
or
noisily
than
did
mine
from
the
time
i
left
baltimore
till
i
reached
philadelphia
the
passage
of
the
susquehanna
river
at
havre
de
grace
was
at
that
time
made
by
on
board
of
which
i
met
a
young
colored
man
by
the
name
of
nichols
who
came
very
near
betraying
me
he
was
a
hand
on
the
boat
but
instead
of
minding
his
business
he
insisted
upon
knowing
me
and
asking
me
dangerous
questions
as
to
where
i
was
going
when
i
was
coming
back
etc
i
got
away
from
my
old
and
inconvenient
acquaintance
as
soon
as
i
could
decently
do
so
and
went
to
another
part
of
the
boat
once
across
the
river
i
encountered
a
new
danger
only
a
few
days
before
i
had
been
at
work
on
a
revenue
cutter
in
price
in
baltimore
under
the
care
of
captain
mcgowan
on
the
meeting
at
this
point
of
the
two
trains
the
one
going
south
stopped
on
the
track
just
opposite
to
the
one
going
north
and
it
so
happened
that
this
captain
mcgowan
sat
at
a
window
where
he
could
see
me
very
distinctly
and
would
certainly
have
recognized
me
had
he
looked
at
me
but
for
a
second
fortunately
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
he
did
not
see
me
and
the
trains
soon
passed
each
other
on
their
respective
ways
but
this
was
not
my
only
escape
a
german
blacksmith
whom
i
knew
well
was
on
the
train
with
me
and
looked
at
me
very
intently
as
if
he
thought
he
had
seen
me
somewhere
before
in
his
travels
i
really
believe
he
knew
me
but
had
no
heart
to
betray
me
at
any
rate
he
saw
me
escaping
and
held
his
peace
the
last
point
of
imminent
danger
and
the
one
i
dreaded
most
was
wilmington
here
we
left
the
train
and
took
the
for
philadelphia
in
making
the
change
here
i
again
apprehended
arrest
but
no
one
disturbed
me
and
i
was
soon
on
the
broad
and
beautiful
delaware
speeding
away
to
the
quaker
city
on
reaching
philadelphia
in
the
afternoon
i
inquired
of
a
colored
man
how
i
could
get
on
to
new
york
he
directed
me
to
the
depot
and
thither
i
went
taking
the
train
that
night
i
reached
new
york
tuesday
morning
having
completed
the
journey
in
less
than
hours
my
free
life
began
on
the
third
of
september
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
that
month
after
an
anxious
and
most
perilous
but
safe
journey
i
found
myself
in
the
big
city
of
new
york
a
free
man
one
more
added
to
the
mighty
throng
which
like
the
confused
waves
of
the
troubled
sea
surged
to
and
fro
between
the
lofty
walls
of
broadway
though
dazzled
with
the
wonders
which
met
me
on
every
hand
my
thoughts
could
not
be
much
withdrawn
from
my
strange
situation
for
the
moment
the
dreams
of
my
youth
and
the
hopes
of
my
manhood
were
completely
fulfilled
the
bonds
that
had
held
me
to
old
master
were
broken
no
man
now
had
a
right
to
call
me
his
slave
or
assert
mastery
over
me
i
was
in
the
rough
and
tumble
of
an
outdoor
world
to
take
my
chance
with
the
rest
of
its
busy
number
i
have
often
been
asked
how
i
felt
when
first
i
found
myself
on
free
soil
there
is
scarcely
anything
in
my
experience
about
which
i
could
not
give
a
more
satisfactory
answer
a
new
world
had
opened
upon
me
if
life
is
more
than
breath
and
the
quick
round
of
blood
i
lived
more
in
that
one
day
than
in
a
year
of
my
slave
life
it
was
a
time
of
joyous
excitement
which
words
can
but
tamely
describe
in
a
letter
written
to
a
friend
soon
after
reaching
new
york
i
said
i
felt
as
one
might
feel
upon
escape
from
a
den
of
hungry
lions
anguish
and
grief
like
darkness
and
rain
may
be
depicted
but
gladness
and
joy
like
the
rainbow
defy
the
skill
of
pen
or
pencil
during
ten
or
fifteen
years
i
had
been
as
it
were
dragging
a
heavy
chain
which
no
strength
of
mine
could
break
i
was
not
only
a
slave
but
a
slave
for
life
i
might
become
a
husband
a
father
an
aged
man
but
through
all
from
birth
to
death
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
i
had
felt
myself
doomed
all
efforts
i
had
previously
made
to
secure
my
freedom
had
not
only
failed
but
had
seemed
only
to
rivet
my
fetters
the
more
firmly
and
to
render
my
escape
more
difficult
baffled
entangled
and
discouraged
i
had
at
times
asked
myself
the
question
may
not
my
condition
after
all
be
work
and
ordered
for
a
wise
purpose
and
if
so
is
not
submission
my
duty
a
contest
had
in
fact
been
going
on
in
my
mind
for
a
long
time
between
the
clear
consciousness
of
right
and
the
plausible
of
theology
and
superstition
the
one
held
me
an
abject
slave
a
prisoner
for
life
punished
for
some
transgression
in
which
i
had
no
lot
nor
part
and
the
other
counseled
me
to
manly
endeavor
to
secure
my
freedom
this
contest
was
now
ended
my
chains
were
broken
and
the
victory
brought
me
unspeakable
joy
but
my
gladness
was
for
i
was
not
yet
out
of
the
reach
and
power
of
the
i
soon
found
that
new
york
was
not
quite
so
free
or
so
safe
a
refuge
as
i
had
supposed
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
insecurity
again
oppressed
me
most
sadly
i
chanced
to
meet
on
the
street
a
few
hours
after
my
landing
a
fugitive
slave
whom
i
had
once
known
well
in
slavery
the
information
received
from
him
alarmed
me
the
fugitive
in
question
was
known
in
baltimore
as
allender
jake
but
in
new
york
he
wore
the
more
respectable
name
of
william
dixon
jake
in
law
was
the
property
of
doctor
allender
and
tolly
allender
the
son
of
the
doctor
had
once
made
an
effort
to
recapture
dixon
but
had
failed
for
want
of
evidence
to
support
his
claim
jake
told
me
the
circumstances
of
this
attempt
and
how
narrowly
he
escaped
being
sent
back
to
slavery
and
torture
he
told
me
that
new
york
was
then
full
of
southerners
returning
from
the
northern
that
the
colored
people
of
new
york
were
not
to
be
trusted
that
there
were
hired
men
of
my
own
color
who
would
betray
me
for
a
few
dollars
that
there
were
hired
men
ever
on
the
lookout
for
fugitives
that
i
must
trust
no
man
with
my
secret
that
i
must
not
think
of
going
either
upon
the
wharves
or
into
any
colored
for
all
such
places
were
closely
watched
that
he
was
himself
unable
to
help
me
and
in
fact
he
seemed
while
speaking
to
me
to
fear
lest
i
myself
might
be
a
spy
and
a
betrayer
under
this
apprehension
as
i
suppose
he
showed
signs
of
wishing
to
be
rid
of
me
and
with
whitewash
brush
in
hand
in
search
of
work
he
soon
disappeared
this
picture
given
by
poor
jake
of
new
york
was
a
damper
to
my
enthusiasm
my
little
store
of
money
would
soon
be
exhausted
and
since
it
would
be
unsafe
for
me
to
go
on
the
wharves
for
work
and
i
had
no
introductions
elsewhere
the
prospect
for
me
was
far
from
cheerful
i
saw
the
wisdom
of
keeping
away
from
the
for
if
pursued
as
i
felt
certain
i
should
be
auld
my
master
would
naturally
seek
me
there
among
the
calkers
every
door
seemed
closed
against
me
i
was
in
the
midst
of
an
ocean
of
my
and
yet
a
perfect
stranger
to
every
one
i
was
without
home
without
acquaintance
without
money
without
credit
without
work
and
without
any
definite
knowledge
as
to
what
course
to
take
or
where
to
look
for
succor
in
such
an
extremity
a
man
had
something
besides
his
freedom
to
think
of
while
wandering
about
the
streets
of
new
york
and
lodging
at
least
one
night
among
the
barrels
on
one
of
the
wharves
i
was
indeed
free
from
slavery
but
free
from
food
and
shelter
as
well
i
kept
my
secret
to
myself
as
long
as
i
could
but
i
was
compelled
at
last
to
seek
some
one
who
would
befriend
me
without
taking
advantage
of
my
destitution
to
betray
me
such
a
person
i
found
in
a
sailor
named
stuart
a
and
generous
fellow
who
from
his
humble
home
on
centre
street
saw
me
standing
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
near
the
tombs
prison
as
he
approached
me
i
ventured
a
remark
to
him
which
at
once
enlisted
his
interest
in
me
he
took
me
to
his
home
to
spend
the
night
and
in
the
morning
went
with
me
to
david
ruggles
the
secretary
of
the
new
york
vigilance
committee
a
with
isaac
hopper
lewis
and
arthur
tappan
theodore
wright
samuel
cornish
thomas
downing
philip
a
bell
and
other
true
men
of
their
time
all
these
save
bell
who
still
lives
and
is
editor
and
publisher
of
a
paper
called
the
elevator
in
san
francisco
have
finished
their
work
on
earth
once
in
the
hands
of
these
brave
and
wise
men
i
felt
comparatively
safe
with
ruggles
on
the
corner
of
lispenard
and
church
streets
i
was
hidden
several
days
during
which
time
my
intended
wife
came
on
from
baltimore
at
my
call
to
share
the
burdens
of
life
with
me
she
was
a
free
woman
and
came
at
once
on
getting
the
good
news
of
my
safety
we
were
married
by
rev
pennington
then
a
and
respected
presbyterian
minister
i
had
no
money
with
which
to
pay
the
marriage
fee
but
he
seemed
well
pleased
with
our
thanks
ruggles
was
the
first
officer
on
the
underground
railroad
whom
i
met
after
coming
north
and
was
indeed
the
only
one
with
whom
i
had
anything
to
do
till
i
became
such
an
officer
myself
learning
that
my
trade
was
that
of
a
calker
he
promptly
decided
that
the
best
place
for
me
was
in
new
bedford
mass
he
told
me
that
many
ships
for
whaling
voyages
were
fitted
out
there
and
that
i
might
there
find
work
at
my
trade
and
make
a
good
living
so
on
the
day
of
the
marriage
ceremony
we
took
our
little
luggage
to
the
steamer
john
richmond
which
at
that
time
was
one
of
the
line
running
between
new
york
and
newport
years
ago
colored
travelers
were
not
permitted
in
the
cabin
nor
allowed
abaft
the
of
a
steam
vessel
they
were
compelled
whatever
the
weather
might
be
whether
cold
or
hot
wet
or
dry
to
spend
the
night
on
deck
unjust
as
this
regulation
was
it
did
not
trouble
us
much
we
had
fared
much
harder
before
we
arrived
at
newport
the
next
morning
and
soon
after
an
old
fashioned
with
new
bedford
in
large
yellow
letters
on
its
sides
came
down
to
the
wharf
i
had
not
money
enough
to
pay
our
fare
and
stood
hesitating
what
to
do
fortunately
for
us
there
were
two
quaker
gentlemen
who
were
about
to
take
passage
on
the
stage
friends
william
taber
and
joseph
ricketson
who
at
once
discerned
our
true
situation
and
in
a
peculiarly
quiet
way
addressing
me
taber
said
thee
get
in
i
never
obeyed
an
order
with
more
alacrity
and
we
were
soon
on
our
way
to
our
new
home
when
we
reached
stone
bridge
the
passengers
alighted
for
breakfast
and
paid
their
fares
to
the
driver
we
took
no
breakfast
and
when
asked
for
our
fares
i
told
the
driver
i
would
make
it
right
with
him
when
we
reached
new
bedford
i
expected
some
objection
to
this
on
his
part
but
he
made
none
when
however
we
reached
new
bedford
he
took
our
baggage
including
three
two
of
them
collections
by
dyer
and
one
by
shaw
and
held
them
until
i
was
able
to
redeem
them
by
paying
to
him
the
amount
due
for
our
rides
this
was
soon
done
for
nathan
johnson
not
only
received
me
kindly
and
hospitably
but
on
being
informed
about
our
baggage
at
once
loaned
me
the
two
dollars
with
which
to
square
accounts
with
the
and
nathan
johnson
reached
a
good
old
age
and
now
rest
from
their
labors
i
am
under
many
grateful
obligations
to
them
they
not
only
took
me
in
when
a
stranger
and
fed
me
when
hungry
but
taught
me
how
to
make
an
honest
living
thus
in
a
fortnight
after
my
flight
from
maryland
i
was
safe
in
new
bedford
a
citizen
of
the
grand
old
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
once
initiated
into
my
new
life
of
freedom
and
assured
by
johnson
that
i
need
not
fear
recapture
in
that
city
a
comparatively
unimportant
question
arose
as
to
the
name
by
which
i
should
be
known
thereafter
in
my
new
relation
as
a
free
man
the
name
given
me
by
my
dear
mother
was
no
less
pretentious
and
long
than
frederick
augustus
washington
bailey
i
had
however
while
living
in
maryland
dispensed
with
the
augustus
washington
and
retained
only
frederick
bailey
between
baltimore
and
new
bedford
the
better
to
conceal
myself
from
the
i
had
parted
with
bailey
and
called
myself
johnson
but
in
new
bedford
i
found
that
the
johnson
family
was
already
so
numerous
as
to
cause
some
confusion
in
distinguishing
them
hence
a
change
in
this
name
seemed
desirable
nathan
johnson
mine
host
placed
great
emphasis
upon
this
necessity
and
wished
me
to
allow
him
to
select
a
name
for
me
i
consented
and
he
called
me
by
my
present
name
the
one
by
which
i
have
been
known
for
three
and
forty
years
frederick
douglass
johnson
had
just
been
reading
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
so
pleased
was
he
with
its
great
character
that
he
wished
me
to
bear
his
name
since
reading
that
charming
poem
myself
i
have
often
thought
that
considering
the
noble
hospitality
and
manly
character
of
nathan
johnson
black
man
though
he
was
he
far
more
than
i
illustrated
the
virtues
of
the
douglas
of
scotland
sure
am
i
that
if
any
had
entered
his
domicile
with
a
view
to
my
recapture
johnson
would
have
shown
himself
like
him
of
the
stalwart
hand
the
reader
may
be
surprised
at
the
impressions
i
had
in
some
way
conceived
of
the
social
and
material
condition
of
the
people
at
the
north
i
had
no
proper
idea
of
the
wealth
refinement
enterprise
and
high
civilization
of
this
section
of
the
country
my
columbian
orator
almost
my
only
book
had
done
nothing
to
enlighten
me
concerning
northern
society
i
had
been
taught
that
slavery
was
the
bottom
fact
of
all
wealth
with
this
foundation
idea
i
came
naturally
to
the
conclusion
that
poverty
must
be
the
general
condition
of
the
people
of
the
free
states
in
the
country
from
which
i
came
a
white
man
holding
no
slaves
was
usually
an
ignorant
and
man
and
men
of
this
class
were
contemptuously
called
poor
white
trash
hence
i
supposed
that
since
the
at
the
south
were
ignorant
poor
and
degraded
as
a
class
the
at
the
north
must
be
in
a
similar
condition
i
could
have
landed
in
no
part
of
the
united
states
where
i
should
have
found
a
more
striking
and
gratifying
contrast
not
only
to
life
generally
in
the
south
but
in
the
condition
of
the
colored
people
there
than
in
new
bedford
i
was
amazed
when
johnson
told
me
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
laws
or
constitution
of
massachusetts
that
would
prevent
a
colored
man
from
being
governor
of
the
state
if
the
people
should
see
fit
to
elect
him
there
too
the
black
man
children
attended
the
public
schools
with
the
white
man
children
and
apparently
without
objection
from
any
quarter
to
impress
me
with
my
security
from
recapture
and
return
to
slavery
johnson
assured
me
that
no
could
take
a
slave
out
of
new
bedford
that
there
were
men
there
who
would
lay
down
their
lives
to
save
me
from
such
a
fate
the
fifth
day
after
my
arrival
i
put
on
the
clothes
of
a
common
laborer
and
went
upon
the
wharves
in
search
of
work
on
my
way
down
union
street
i
saw
a
large
pile
of
coal
in
front
of
the
house
of
rev
ephraim
peabody
the
unitarian
minister
i
went
to
the
kitchen
door
and
asked
the
privilege
of
bringing
in
and
putting
away
this
coal
what
will
you
charge
said
the
lady
i
will
leave
that
to
you
madam
you
may
put
it
away
she
said
i
was
not
long
in
accomplishing
the
job
when
the
dear
lady
put
into
my
hand
two
silver
to
understand
the
emotion
which
swelled
my
heart
as
i
clasped
this
money
realizing
that
i
had
no
master
who
could
take
it
from
me
that
it
was
mine
that
my
hands
were
my
own
and
could
earn
more
of
the
precious
coin
one
must
have
been
in
some
sense
himself
a
slave
my
next
job
was
stowing
a
sloop
at
uncle
gid
howland
wharf
with
a
cargo
of
oil
for
new
york
i
was
not
only
a
freeman
but
a
free
and
no
master
stood
ready
at
the
end
of
the
week
to
seize
my
hard
earnings
the
season
was
growing
late
and
work
was
plenty
ships
were
being
fitted
out
for
whaling
and
much
wood
was
used
in
storing
them
the
sawing
this
wood
was
considered
a
good
job
with
the
help
of
old
friend
johnson
blessings
on
his
memory
i
got
a
saw
and
buck
and
went
at
it
when
i
went
into
a
store
to
buy
a
cord
with
which
to
brace
up
my
saw
in
the
frame
i
asked
for
a
fip
worth
of
cord
the
man
behind
the
counter
looked
rather
sharply
at
me
and
said
with
equal
sharpness
you
belong
about
here
i
was
alarmed
and
thought
i
had
betrayed
myself
a
fip
in
maryland
was
six
and
a
quarter
cents
called
fourpence
in
massachusetts
but
no
harm
came
from
the
blunder
and
i
confidently
and
cheerfully
went
to
work
with
my
saw
and
buck
it
was
new
business
to
me
but
i
never
did
better
work
or
more
of
it
in
the
same
space
of
time
on
the
plantation
for
covey
the
than
i
did
for
myself
in
these
earliest
years
of
my
freedom
notwithstanding
the
just
and
humane
sentiment
of
new
bedford
three
and
forty
years
ago
the
place
was
not
entirely
free
from
race
and
color
prejudice
the
good
influence
of
the
roaches
rodmans
arnolds
grinnells
and
robesons
did
not
pervade
all
classes
of
its
people
the
test
of
the
real
civilization
of
the
community
came
when
i
applied
for
work
at
my
trade
and
then
my
repulse
was
emphatic
and
decisive
it
so
happened
that
rodney
french
a
wealthy
and
enterprising
citizen
distinguished
as
an
man
was
fitting
out
a
vessel
for
a
whaling
voyage
upon
which
there
was
a
heavy
job
of
calking
and
coppering
to
be
done
i
had
some
skill
in
both
branches
and
applied
to
french
for
work
he
generous
man
that
he
was
told
me
he
would
employ
me
and
i
might
go
at
once
to
the
vessel
i
obeyed
him
but
upon
reaching
the
where
others
sic
calkers
were
at
work
i
was
told
that
every
white
man
would
leave
the
ship
in
her
unfinished
condition
if
i
struck
a
blow
at
my
trade
upon
her
this
uncivil
inhuman
and
selfish
treatment
was
not
so
shocking
and
scandalous
in
my
eyes
at
the
time
as
it
now
appears
to
me
slavery
had
inured
me
to
hardships
that
made
ordinary
trouble
sit
lightly
upon
me
could
i
have
worked
at
my
trade
i
could
have
earned
two
dollars
a
day
but
as
a
common
laborer
i
received
but
one
dollar
the
difference
was
of
great
importance
to
me
but
if
i
could
not
get
two
dollars
i
was
glad
to
get
one
and
so
i
went
to
work
for
french
as
a
common
laborer
the
consciousness
that
i
was
free
no
longer
a
slave
kept
me
cheerful
under
this
and
many
similar
proscriptions
which
i
was
destined
to
meet
in
new
bedford
and
elsewhere
on
the
free
soil
of
massachusetts
for
instance
though
colored
children
attended
the
schools
and
were
treated
kindly
by
their
teachers
the
new
bedford
lyceum
refused
till
several
years
after
my
residence
in
that
city
to
allow
any
colored
person
to
attend
the
lectures
delivered
in
its
hall
not
until
such
men
as
charles
sumner
theodore
parker
ralph
waldo
emerson
and
horace
mann
refused
to
lecture
in
their
course
while
there
was
such
a
restriction
was
it
abandoned
becoming
satisfied
that
i
could
not
rely
on
my
trade
in
new
bedford
to
give
me
a
living
i
prepared
myself
to
do
any
kind
of
work
that
came
to
hand
i
sawed
wood
shoveled
coal
dug
cellars
moved
rubbish
from
back
yards
worked
on
the
wharves
loaded
and
unloaded
vessels
and
scoured
their
cabins
i
afterward
got
steady
work
at
the
owned
by
richmond
my
duty
here
was
to
blow
the
bellows
swing
the
crane
and
empty
the
flasks
in
which
castings
were
made
and
at
times
this
was
hot
and
heavy
work
the
articles
produced
here
were
mostly
for
ship
work
and
in
the
busy
season
the
foundry
was
in
operation
night
and
day
i
have
often
worked
two
nights
and
every
working
day
of
the
week
my
foreman
cobb
was
a
good
man
and
more
than
once
protected
me
from
abuse
that
one
or
more
of
the
hands
was
disposed
to
throw
upon
me
while
in
this
situation
i
had
little
time
for
mental
improvement
hard
work
night
and
day
over
a
furnace
hot
enough
to
keep
the
metal
running
like
water
was
more
favorable
to
action
than
thought
yet
here
i
often
nailed
a
newspaper
to
the
post
near
my
bellows
and
read
while
i
was
performing
the
up
and
down
motion
of
the
heavy
beam
by
which
the
bellows
was
inflated
and
discharged
it
was
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
under
difficulties
and
i
look
back
to
it
now
after
so
many
years
with
some
complacency
and
a
little
wonder
that
i
could
have
been
so
earnest
and
persevering
in
any
pursuit
other
than
for
my
daily
bread
i
certainly
saw
nothing
in
the
conduct
of
those
around
to
inspire
me
with
such
interest
they
were
all
devoted
exclusively
to
what
their
hands
found
to
do
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
say
that
during
my
engagement
in
this
foundry
no
complaint
was
ever
made
against
me
that
i
did
not
do
my
work
and
do
it
well
the
bellows
which
i
worked
by
main
strength
was
after
i
left
moved
by
a
douglass
frederick
reconstruction
atlantic
monthly
reconstruction
the
assembling
of
the
second
session
of
the
congress
may
very
properly
be
made
the
occasion
of
a
few
earnest
words
on
the
already
topic
of
reconstruction
seldom
has
any
legislative
body
been
the
subject
of
a
solicitude
more
intense
or
of
aspirations
more
sincere
and
ardent
there
are
the
best
of
reasons
for
this
profound
interest
questions
of
vast
moment
left
undecided
by
the
last
session
of
congress
must
be
manfully
grappled
with
by
this
no
political
skirmishing
will
avail
the
occasion
demands
statesmanship
whether
the
tremendous
war
so
heroically
fought
and
so
victoriously
ended
shall
pass
into
history
a
miserable
failure
barren
of
permanent
results
a
scandalous
and
shocking
waste
of
blood
and
treasure
a
strife
for
empire
as
earl
russell
characterized
it
of
no
value
to
liberty
or
civilization
an
attempt
to
a
union
by
force
which
must
be
the
merest
mockery
of
a
union
an
effort
to
bring
under
federal
authority
states
into
which
no
loyal
man
from
the
north
may
safely
enter
and
to
bring
men
into
the
national
councils
who
deliberate
with
daggers
and
vote
with
revolvers
and
who
do
not
even
conceal
their
deadly
hate
of
the
country
that
conquered
them
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
we
shall
as
the
rightful
reward
of
victory
over
treason
have
a
solid
nation
entirely
delivered
from
all
contradictions
and
social
antagonisms
based
upon
loyalty
liberty
and
equality
must
be
determined
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
present
session
of
congress
the
last
session
really
did
nothing
which
can
be
considered
final
as
to
these
questions
the
civil
rights
bill
and
the
freedmen
bureau
bill
and
the
proposed
constitutional
amendments
with
the
amendment
already
adopted
and
recognized
as
the
law
of
the
land
do
not
reach
the
difficulty
and
can
not
unless
the
whole
structure
of
the
government
is
changed
from
a
government
by
states
to
something
like
a
despotic
central
government
with
power
to
control
even
the
municipal
regulations
of
states
and
to
make
them
conform
to
its
own
despotic
will
while
there
remains
such
an
idea
as
the
right
of
each
state
to
control
its
own
local
affairs
an
idea
by
the
way
more
deeply
rooted
in
the
minds
of
men
of
all
sections
of
the
country
than
perhaps
any
one
other
political
idea
no
general
assertion
of
human
rights
can
be
of
any
practical
value
to
change
the
character
of
the
government
at
this
point
is
neither
possible
nor
desirable
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
done
is
to
make
the
government
consistent
with
itself
and
render
the
rights
of
the
states
compatible
with
the
sacred
rights
of
human
nature
the
arm
of
the
federal
government
is
long
but
it
is
far
too
short
to
protect
the
rights
of
individuals
in
the
interior
of
distant
states
they
must
have
the
power
to
protect
themselves
or
they
will
go
unprotected
spite
of
all
the
laws
the
federal
government
can
put
upon
the
national
slavery
like
all
other
great
systems
of
wrong
founded
in
the
depths
of
human
selfishness
and
existing
for
ages
has
not
neglected
its
own
conservation
it
has
steadily
exerted
an
influence
upon
all
around
it
favorable
to
its
own
continuance
and
it
is
so
strong
that
it
could
exist
not
only
without
law
but
even
against
law
custom
manners
morals
religion
are
all
on
its
side
everywhere
in
the
south
and
when
you
add
the
ignorance
and
servility
of
the
to
the
intelligence
and
accustomed
authority
of
the
master
you
have
the
conditions
not
out
of
which
slavery
will
again
grow
but
under
which
it
is
impossible
for
the
federal
government
to
wholly
destroy
it
unless
the
federal
government
be
armed
with
despotic
power
to
blot
out
state
authority
and
to
station
a
federal
officer
at
every
this
of
course
can
not
be
done
and
ought
not
even
if
it
could
the
true
way
and
the
easiest
way
is
to
make
our
government
entirely
consistent
with
itself
and
give
to
every
loyal
citizen
the
elective
franchise
a
right
and
power
which
will
be
ever
present
and
will
form
a
wall
of
fire
for
his
protection
one
of
the
invaluable
compensations
of
the
late
rebellion
is
the
highly
instructive
disclosure
it
made
of
the
true
source
of
danger
to
republican
government
whatever
may
be
tolerated
in
monarchical
and
despotic
governments
no
republic
is
safe
that
tolerates
a
privileged
class
or
denies
to
any
of
its
citizens
equal
rights
and
equal
means
to
maintain
them
what
was
theory
before
the
war
has
been
made
fact
by
the
war
there
is
cause
to
be
thankful
even
for
rebellion
it
is
an
impressive
teacher
though
a
stern
and
terrible
one
in
both
characters
it
has
come
to
us
and
it
was
perhaps
needed
in
both
it
is
an
instructor
never
a
day
before
its
time
for
it
comes
only
when
all
other
means
of
progress
and
enlightenment
have
failed
whether
the
oppressed
and
despairing
bondman
no
longer
able
to
repress
his
deep
yearnings
for
manhood
or
the
tyrant
in
his
pride
and
impatience
takes
the
initiative
and
strikes
the
blow
for
a
firmer
hold
and
a
longer
lease
of
oppression
the
result
is
the
same
society
is
instructed
or
may
be
such
are
the
limitations
of
the
common
mind
and
so
thoroughly
engrossing
are
the
cares
of
common
life
that
only
the
few
among
men
can
discern
through
the
glitter
and
dazzle
of
present
prosperity
the
dark
outlines
of
approaching
disasters
even
though
they
may
have
come
up
to
our
very
gates
and
are
already
within
striking
distance
the
yawning
seam
and
corroded
bolt
conceal
their
defects
from
the
mariner
until
the
storm
calls
all
hands
to
the
pumps
prophets
indeed
were
abundant
before
the
war
but
who
cares
for
prophets
while
their
predictions
remain
unfulfilled
and
the
calamities
of
which
they
tell
are
masked
behind
a
blinding
blaze
of
national
prosperity
it
is
asked
said
henry
clay
on
a
memorable
occasion
will
slavery
never
come
to
an
end
that
question
said
he
was
asked
fifty
years
ago
and
it
has
been
answered
by
fifty
years
of
unprecedented
prosperity
spite
of
the
eloquence
of
the
earnest
abolitionists
poured
out
against
slavery
during
thirty
years
even
they
must
confess
that
in
all
the
probabilities
of
the
case
that
system
of
barbarism
would
have
continued
its
horrors
far
beyond
the
limits
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
for
the
rebellion
and
perhaps
only
have
disappeared
at
last
in
a
fiery
conflict
even
more
fierce
and
bloody
than
that
which
has
now
been
suppressed
it
is
no
disparagement
to
truth
that
it
can
only
prevail
where
reason
prevails
war
begins
where
reason
ends
the
thing
worse
than
rebellion
is
the
thing
that
causes
rebellion
what
that
thing
is
we
have
been
taught
to
our
cost
it
remains
now
to
be
seen
whether
we
have
the
needed
courage
to
have
that
cause
entirely
removed
from
the
republic
at
any
rate
to
this
grand
work
of
national
regeneration
and
entire
purification
congress
must
now
address
itself
with
full
purpose
that
the
work
shall
this
time
be
thoroughly
done
the
deadly
upas
root
and
branch
leaf
and
fibre
body
and
sap
must
be
utterly
destroyed
the
country
is
evidently
not
in
a
condition
to
listen
patiently
to
pleas
for
postponement
however
plausible
nor
will
it
permit
the
responsibility
to
be
shifted
to
other
shoulders
authority
and
power
are
here
commensurate
with
the
duty
imposed
there
are
no
shadows
to
obscure
the
way
truth
shines
with
brighter
light
and
intenser
heat
at
every
moment
and
a
country
torn
and
rent
and
bleeding
implores
relief
from
its
distress
and
agony
if
time
was
at
first
needed
congress
has
now
had
time
all
the
requisite
materials
from
which
to
form
an
intelligent
judgment
are
now
before
it
whether
its
members
look
at
the
origin
the
progress
the
termination
of
the
war
or
at
the
mockery
of
a
peace
now
existing
they
will
find
only
one
unbroken
chain
of
argument
in
favor
of
a
radical
policy
of
reconstruction
for
the
omissions
of
the
last
session
some
excuses
may
be
allowed
a
treacherous
president
stood
in
the
way
and
it
can
be
easily
seen
how
reluctant
good
men
might
be
to
admit
an
apostasy
which
involved
so
much
of
baseness
and
ingratitude
it
was
natural
that
they
should
seek
to
save
him
by
bending
to
him
even
when
he
leaned
to
the
side
of
error
but
all
is
changed
now
congress
knows
now
that
it
must
go
on
without
his
aid
and
even
against
his
machinations
the
advantage
of
the
present
session
over
the
last
is
immense
where
that
investigated
this
has
the
facts
where
that
walked
by
faith
this
may
walk
by
sight
where
that
halted
this
must
go
forward
and
where
that
failed
this
must
succeed
giving
the
country
whole
measures
where
that
gave
us
merely
as
a
means
of
saving
the
elections
in
a
few
doubtful
districts
that
congress
saw
what
was
right
but
distrusted
the
enlightenment
of
the
loyal
masses
but
what
was
forborne
in
distrust
of
the
people
must
now
be
done
with
a
full
knowledge
that
the
people
expect
and
require
it
the
members
go
to
washington
fresh
from
the
inspiring
presence
of
the
people
in
every
considerable
public
meeting
and
in
almost
every
conceivable
way
whether
at
or
in
doors
and
out
the
subject
has
been
discussed
and
the
people
have
emphatically
pronounced
in
favor
of
a
radical
policy
listening
to
the
doctrines
of
expediency
and
compromise
with
pity
impatience
and
disgust
they
have
everywhere
broken
into
demonstrations
of
the
wildest
enthusiasm
when
a
brave
word
has
been
spoken
in
favor
of
equal
rights
and
impartial
suffrage
radicalism
so
far
from
being
odious
is
not
the
popular
passport
to
power
the
men
most
bitterly
charged
with
it
go
to
congress
with
the
largest
majorities
while
the
timid
and
doubtful
are
sent
by
lean
majorities
or
else
left
at
home
the
strange
controversy
between
the
president
and
the
congress
at
one
time
so
threatening
is
disposed
of
by
the
people
the
high
reconstructive
powers
which
he
so
confidently
ostentatiously
and
haughtily
claimed
have
been
disallowed
denounced
and
utterly
repudiated
while
those
claimed
by
congress
have
been
confirmed
of
the
spirit
and
magnitude
of
the
canvass
nothing
need
be
said
the
appeal
was
to
the
people
and
the
verdict
was
worthy
of
the
tribunal
upon
an
occasion
of
his
own
selection
with
the
advice
and
approval
of
his
astute
secretary
soon
after
the
members
of
the
congress
had
returned
to
their
constituents
the
president
quitted
the
executive
mansion
sandwiched
himself
between
two
recognized
heroes
men
whom
the
whole
country
delighted
to
honor
and
with
all
the
advantage
which
such
company
could
give
him
stumped
the
country
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mississippi
advocating
everywhere
his
policy
as
against
that
of
congress
it
was
a
strange
sight
and
perhaps
the
most
disgraceful
exhibition
ever
made
by
any
president
but
as
no
evil
is
entirely
unmixed
good
has
come
of
this
as
from
many
others
ambitious
unscrupulous
energetic
indefatigable
voluble
and
plausible
a
political
gladiator
ready
for
a
in
any
crowd
he
is
beaten
in
his
own
chosen
field
and
stands
before
the
country
as
a
convicted
usurper
a
political
criminal
guilty
of
a
bold
and
persistent
attempt
to
possess
himself
of
the
legislative
powers
solemnly
secured
to
congress
by
the
constitution
no
vindication
could
be
more
complete
no
condemnation
could
be
more
absolute
and
humiliating
unless
reopened
by
the
sword
as
recklessly
threatened
in
some
circles
this
question
is
now
closed
for
all
time
without
attempting
to
settle
here
the
metaphysical
and
somewhat
theological
question
about
which
so
much
has
already
been
said
and
written
whether
once
in
the
union
means
always
in
the
union
agreeably
to
the
formula
once
in
grace
always
in
grace
it
is
obvious
to
common
sense
that
the
rebellious
states
stand
in
point
of
law
precisely
where
they
stood
when
exhausted
beaten
conquered
they
fell
powerless
at
the
feet
of
federal
authority
their
state
governments
were
overthrown
and
the
lives
and
property
of
the
leaders
of
the
rebellion
were
forfeited
in
reconstructing
the
institutions
of
these
shattered
and
overthrown
states
congress
should
begin
with
a
clean
slate
and
make
clean
work
of
it
let
there
be
no
hesitation
it
would
be
a
cowardly
deference
to
a
defeated
and
treacherous
president
if
any
account
were
made
of
the
illegitimate
sham
governments
hurried
into
existence
for
a
malign
purpose
in
the
absence
of
congress
these
pretended
governments
which
were
never
submitted
to
the
people
and
from
participation
in
which
four
millions
of
the
loyal
people
were
excluded
by
presidential
order
should
now
be
treated
according
to
their
true
character
as
shams
and
impositions
and
supplanted
by
true
and
legitimate
governments
in
the
formation
of
which
loyal
men
black
and
white
shall
participate
it
is
not
however
within
the
scope
of
this
paper
to
point
out
the
precise
steps
to
be
taken
and
the
means
to
be
employed
the
people
are
less
concerned
about
these
than
the
grand
end
to
be
attained
they
demand
such
a
reconstruction
as
shall
put
an
end
to
the
present
anarchical
state
of
things
in
the
late
rebellious
states
where
frightful
murders
and
wholesale
massacres
are
perpetrated
in
the
very
presence
of
federal
soldiers
this
horrible
business
they
require
shall
cease
they
want
a
reconstruction
such
as
will
protect
loyal
men
black
and
white
in
their
persons
and
property
such
a
one
as
will
cause
northern
industry
northern
capital
and
northern
civilization
to
flow
into
the
south
and
make
a
man
from
new
england
as
much
at
home
in
carolina
as
elsewhere
in
the
republic
no
chinese
wall
can
now
be
tolerated
the
south
must
be
opened
to
the
light
of
law
and
liberty
and
this
session
of
congress
is
relied
upon
to
accomplish
this
important
work
the
plain
way
of
doing
this
work
as
intimated
at
the
beginning
is
simply
to
establish
in
the
south
one
law
one
government
one
administration
of
justice
one
condition
to
the
exercise
of
the
elective
franchise
for
men
of
all
races
and
colors
alike
this
great
measure
is
sought
as
earnestly
by
loyal
white
men
as
by
loyal
blacks
and
is
needed
alike
by
both
let
sound
political
prescience
but
take
the
place
of
an
unreasoning
prejudice
and
this
will
be
done
men
denounce
the
negro
for
his
prominence
in
this
discussion
but
it
is
no
fault
of
his
that
in
peace
as
in
war
that
in
conquering
rebel
armies
as
in
reconstructing
the
rebellious
states
the
right
of
the
negro
is
the
true
solution
of
our
national
troubles
the
stern
logic
of
events
which
goes
directly
to
the
point
disdaining
all
concern
for
the
color
or
features
of
men
has
determined
the
interests
of
the
country
as
identical
with
and
inseparable
from
those
of
the
negro
the
policy
that
emancipated
and
armed
the
negro
now
seen
to
have
been
wise
and
proper
by
the
dullest
was
not
certainly
more
sternly
demanded
than
is
now
the
policy
of
enfranchisement
if
with
the
negro
was
success
in
war
and
without
him
failure
so
in
peace
it
will
be
found
that
the
nation
must
fall
or
flourish
with
the
negro
fortunately
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
knows
no
distinction
between
citizens
on
account
of
color
neither
does
it
know
any
difference
between
a
citizen
of
a
state
and
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
citizenship
evidently
includes
all
the
rights
of
citizens
whether
state
or
national
if
the
constitution
knows
none
it
is
clearly
no
part
of
the
duty
of
a
republican
congress
now
to
institute
one
the
mistake
of
the
last
session
was
the
attempt
to
do
this
very
thing
by
a
renunciation
of
its
power
to
secure
political
rights
to
any
class
of
citizens
with
the
obvious
purpose
to
allow
the
rebellious
states
to
disfranchise
if
they
should
see
fit
their
colored
citizens
this
unfortunate
blunder
must
now
be
retrieved
and
the
emasculated
citizenship
given
to
the
negro
supplanted
by
that
contemplated
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
declares
that
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
enjoy
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
several
states
so
that
a
legal
voter
in
any
state
shall
be
a
legal
voter
in
all
the
states
