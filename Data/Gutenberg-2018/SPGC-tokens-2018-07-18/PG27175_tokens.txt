your
chiefest
treasure

you
never
heard
it
said

take

better
things

leave
the
worse
ones

may
be
used
to
shake
the
massive
paws

introduction
i
call
you
bad
my
little
child
upon
the
title
page
because
a
manner
rude
and
wild
is
common
at
your
age
the
moral
of
this
priceless
work
if
rightly
understood
will
make
you
from
a
little
turk
unnaturally
good
do
not
as
evil
children
do
who
on
the
slightest
grounds
will
imitate
the
kangaroo
with
wild
unmeaning
bounds
illustration
do
not
as
children
badly
bred
who
eat
like
little
hogs
and
when
they
have
to
go
to
bed
will
whine
like
puppy
dogs
who
take
their
manners
from
the
ape
their
habits
from
the
bear
indulge
the
loud
unseemly
jape
and
never
brush
their
hair

so
control
your
actions
that
your
friends
may
all
repeat
