chapter
i
dream
by
dream
shot
through
her
eyes
and
each
outshone
the
last
that
lighted
swinburne
midnight
without
darkness
without
stars
midnight
and
the
unwearied
sun
stood
yet
visible
in
the
heavens
like
a
victorious
king
throned
on
a
dais
of
royal
purple
bordered
with
gold
the
sky
above
him
his
canopy
gleamed
with
a
cold
yet
lustrous
blue
while
across
it
slowly
flitted
a
few
wandering
clouds
of
palest
amber
deepening
as
they
sailed
along
to
a
tawny
orange
a
broad
stream
of
light
falling
as
it
were
from
the
centre
of
the
magnificent
orb
shot
lengthwise
across
the
altenfjord
turning
its
waters
to
a
mass
of
quivering
and
shifting
color
that
alternated
from
bronze
to
copper
from
copper
to
silver
and
azure
the
surrounding
hills
glowed
with
a
warm
deep
violet
tint
flecked
here
and
there
with
touches
of
bright
red
as
though
fairies
were
lighting
tiny
bonfires
on
their
summits
away
in
the
distance
a
huge
mass
of
rock
stood
out
to
view
its
rugged
lines
transfigured
into
ethereal
loveliness
by
a
misty
veil
of
tender
rose
pink
a
hue
curiously
suggestive
of
some
other
and
smaller
sun
that
might
have
just
set
absolute
silence
prevailed
not
even
the
cry
of
a
or
kittiwake
broke
the
almost
deathlike
stillness
no
breath
of
wind
stirred
a
ripple
on
the
glassy
water
the
whole
scene
might
well
have
been
the
fantastic
dream
of
some
imaginative
painter
whose
ambition
soared
beyond
the
limits
of
human
skill
yet
it
was
only
one
of
those
million
wonderful
effects
of
sky
and
sea
which
are
common
in
norway
especially
on
the
altenfjord
where
though
beyond
the
arctic
circle
the
climate
in
summer
is
that
of
another
italy
and
the
landscape
a
living
poem
fairer
than
the
visions
of
endymion
there
was
one
solitary
watcher
of
the
splendid
spectacle
this
was
a
man
of
refined
features
and
aristocratic
appearance
who
reclining
on
a
large
rug
of
skins
which
he
had
thrown
down
on
the
shore
for
that
purpose
was
gazing
at
the
pageant
of
the
midnight
sun
and
all
its
stately
surroundings
with
an
earnest
and
rapt
expression
in
his
clear
hazel
eyes
glorious
beyond
all
expectation
glorious
he
murmured
half
aloud
as
he
consulted
his
watch
and
saw
that
the
hands
marked
exactly
twelve
on
the
dial
i
believe
i
having
the
best
of
it
after
all
even
if
those
fellows
get
the
into
good
position
they
will
see
nothing
finer
than
this
as
he
spoke
he
raised
his
and
swept
the
horizon
in
search
of
a
vessel
his
own
pleasure
yacht
which
had
taken
three
of
his
friends
at
their
special
desire
to
the
opposite
island
of
seiland
seiland
rising
in
weird
majesty
three
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
boasting
as
its
chief
glory
the
great
peak
of
jedkè
the
most
northern
glacier
in
all
the
wild
norwegian
land
there
was
no
sign
of
a
returning
sail
and
he
resumed
his
study
of
the
sumptuous
sky
the
colors
of
which
were
now
deepening
and
burning
with
increasing
lustre
while
an
array
of
clouds
of
the
deepest
purple
hue
swept
gorgeously
together
beneath
the
sun
as
though
to
form
his
footstool
one
might
imagine
that
the
trump
of
the
resurrection
had
sounded
and
that
all
this
aerial
pomp
this
strange
silence
was
just
the
pause
the
supreme
moment
before
the
angels
descended
he
mused
with
a
at
his
own
fancy
for
though
something
of
a
poet
at
heart
he
was
much
more
of
a
cynic
he
was
too
deeply
imbued
with
modern
fashionable
atheism
to
think
seriously
about
angels
or
resurrection
trumps
but
there
was
a
certain
love
of
mysticism
and
romance
in
his
nature
which
not
even
his
oxford
experiences
and
the
chilly
dullness
of
english
materialism
had
been
able
to
eradicate
and
there
was
something
impressive
in
the
sight
of
the
majestic
orb
holding
such
imperial
revel
at
midnight
something
almost
unearthly
in
the
light
and
life
of
the
heavens
as
compared
with
the
referential
and
seemingly
worshipping
silence
of
the
earth
that
for
a
few
moments
awed
him
into
a
sense
of
the
spiritual
and
unseen
mythical
passages
from
the
poets
he
loved
came
into
his
memory
and
stray
fragments
of
old
songs
and
ballads
he
had
known
in
his
childhood
returned
to
him
with
haunting
persistence
it
was
for
him
one
of
those
sudden
halts
in
life
which
we
all
experience
an
instant
when
time
and
the
world
seem
to
stand
still
as
though
to
permit
us
easy
breathing
a
brief
space
in
which
we
are
allowed
to
stop
and
wonder
awhile
at
the
strange
unaccountable
force
within
us
that
enables
us
to
stand
with
such
calm
smiling
audacity
on
our
small
pin
point
of
the
present
between
the
wide
dark
gaps
of
past
and
future
a
small
hush
in
which
the
gigantic
engines
of
the
universe
appear
to
revolve
no
more
and
the
immortal
soul
of
man
itself
is
subjected
and
by
supreme
and
eternal
thought
drifting
away
on
those
delicate
imperceptible
lines
that
lie
between
reality
and
dreamland
the
watcher
of
the
midnight
sun
gave
himself
up
to
the
half
painful
half
delicious
sense
of
being
drawn
in
absorbed
and
lost
in
infinite
imaginings
when
the
intense
stillness
around
him
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
singing
a
full
rich
contralto
that
rang
through
the
air
with
the
clearness
of
a
golden
bell
the
sweet
liquid
notes
were
those
of
an
old
norwegian
mountain
melody
one
of
those
wildly
pathetic
that
seem
to
hold
all
the
sorrow
wonder
wistfulness
and
indescribable
yearning
of
a
heart
too
full
for
other
speech
than
music
he
started
to
his
feet
and
looked
around
him
for
the
singer
there
was
no
one
visible
the
amber
streaks
in
the
sky
were
leaping
into
crimson
flame
the
fjord
glowed
like
the
burning
lake
of
dante
vision
one
solitary
winged
its
graceful
noiseless
flight
far
above
its
white
pinions
shimmering
like
jewels
as
it
crossed
the
radiance
of
the
heavens
other
sign
of
animal
life
there
was
none
still
the
hidden
voice
rippled
on
in
a
stream
of
melody
and
the
listener
stood
amazed
and
enchanted
at
the
roundness
and
distinctness
of
every
note
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
unseen
vocalist
a
woman
voice
he
thought
but
where
is
the
woman
puzzled
he
looked
to
the
right
and
left
then
out
to
the
shining
fjord
half
expecting
to
see
some
rowing
along
and
singing
as
she
rowed
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
living
creature
while
he
waited
the
voice
suddenly
ceased
and
the
song
was
replaced
by
the
sharp
grating
of
a
keel
on
the
beach
turning
in
the
direction
of
this
sound
he
perceived
a
boat
being
pushed
out
by
invisible
hands
towards
the
water
edge
from
a
rocky
cave
that
jutted
upon
the
fjord
and
full
of
curiosity
he
stepped
towards
the
arched
entrance
when
all
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
a
girl
sprang
out
from
the
dark
interior
and
standing
erect
in
her
boat
faced
the
intruder
a
girl
of
about
nineteen
she
seemed
taller
than
most
women
with
a
magnificent
uncovered
mass
of
hair
the
color
of
the
midnight
sunshine
tumbled
over
her
shoulders
and
flashing
against
her
flushed
cheeks
and
dazzlingly
fair
skin
her
deep
blue
eyes
had
an
astonished
and
certainly
indignant
expression
in
them
while
he
utterly
unprepared
for
such
a
vision
of
loveliness
at
such
a
time
and
in
such
a
place
was
for
a
moment
taken
aback
and
at
a
loss
for
words
recovering
his
habitual
quickly
however
he
raised
his
hat
and
pointing
to
the
boat
which
was
more
than
half
way
out
of
the
cavern
said
simply
may
i
assist
you
she
was
silent
eyeing
him
with
a
keen
glance
which
had
something
in
it
of
disfavor
and
suspicion
i
suppose
she
does
understand
english
he
thought
and
i
speak
a
word
of
norwegian
i
must
talk
by
signs
and
forthwith
he
went
through
a
labored
pantomime
of
gesture
sufficiently
ludicrous
in
itself
yet
at
the
same
time
expressive
of
his
meaning
the
girl
broke
into
a
laugh
a
laugh
of
sweet
amusement
which
brought
a
thousand
new
sparkles
of
light
into
her
lovely
eyes
that
is
very
well
done
she
observed
graciously
speaking
english
with
something
of
a
foreign
accent
even
the
lapps
would
understand
you
and
they
are
very
stupid
poor
things
half
vexed
by
her
laughter
and
feeling
that
he
was
somehow
an
object
of
ridicule
to
this
tall
maiden
he
ceased
his
pantomimic
gestures
abruptly
and
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
slight
flush
of
embarrassment
on
his
features
i
know
your
language
she
resumed
quietly
after
a
brief
pause
in
which
she
had
apparently
considered
the
stranger
appearance
and
general
bearing
it
was
rude
of
me
not
to
have
answered
you
at
once
you
can
help
me
if
you
will
the
keel
has
caught
among
the
pebbles
but
we
can
easily
move
it
between
us
and
jumping
lightly
out
of
her
boat
she
grasped
its
edge
firmly
with
her
strong
white
hands
exclaiming
gaily
as
she
did
so
push
thus
adjured
he
lost
no
time
in
complying
with
her
request
and
using
his
great
strength
and
muscular
force
to
good
purpose
the
light
little
craft
was
soon
well
in
the
water
swaying
to
and
fro
as
though
with
impatience
to
be
gone
the
girl
sprang
to
her
seat
discarding
his
eagerly
proffered
assistance
and
taking
both
oars
laid
them
in
their
respective
rowlocks
and
seemed
about
to
start
when
she
paused
and
asked
abruptly
are
you
a
sailor
he
smiled
not
i
do
i
remind
you
of
one
you
are
strong
and
you
manage
a
boat
as
though
you
were
accustomed
to
the
work
also
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
at
sea
rightly
guessed
he
replied
still
smiling
i
certainly
been
at
sea
i
have
been
coasting
all
about
your
lovely
land
my
yacht
went
across
to
seiland
this
afternoon
she
regarded
him
more
intently
and
observed
with
the
critical
eye
of
a
woman
the
refined
taste
displayed
in
his
dress
from
the
very
cut
of
his
loose
travelling
coat
to
the
luxurious
rug
of
fine
that
lay
so
carelessly
cast
on
the
shore
at
a
little
distance
from
him
then
she
gave
a
gesture
of
hauteur
and
you
have
a
yacht
oh
then
you
are
a
gentleman
you
do
nothing
for
your
living
nothing
indeed
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
mingled
air
of
weariness
and
except
one
thing
i
live
is
that
hard
work
she
inquired
wonderingly
very
they
were
silent
then
and
the
girl
face
grew
serious
as
she
rested
on
her
oars
and
still
surveyed
him
with
a
straight
candid
gaze
that
though
earnest
and
penetrating
had
nothing
of
boldness
in
it
it
was
the
look
of
one
in
whose
past
there
were
no
secrets
the
look
of
a
child
who
is
satisfied
with
the
present
and
takes
no
thought
for
the
future
few
women
look
so
after
they
have
entered
their
teens
social
artifice
affectation
and
the
insatiate
vanity
that
modern
life
encourages
in
the
feminine
nature
all
these
things
soon
do
away
with
the
pellucid
clearness
and
steadfastness
of
the
eye
the
beautiful
true
untamed
expression
which
though
so
rare
is
when
seen
infinitely
more
bewitching
than
all
the
bright
arrows
of
coquetry
and
sparkling
invitation
that
flash
from
the
glances
of
society
dames
who
have
taken
care
to
educate
their
eyes
if
not
their
hearts
this
girl
was
evidently
not
trained
properly
had
she
been
so
she
would
have
dropped
a
curtain
over
those
wide
bright
windows
of
her
soul
she
would
have
remembered
that
she
was
alone
with
a
strange
man
at
midnight
at
midnight
though
the
sun
shone
she
would
have
simpered
and
feigned
embarrassment
even
if
she
could
not
feel
it
as
it
happened
she
did
nothing
of
the
kind
only
her
expression
softened
and
became
more
wistful
and
earnest
and
when
she
spoke
again
her
voice
was
mellow
with
a
suave
gentleness
that
had
something
in
it
of
compassion
if
you
do
not
love
life
itself
she
said
you
love
the
beautiful
things
of
life
do
you
not
see
yonder
there
is
what
we
call
the
meeting
of
night
and
morning
one
is
glad
to
be
alive
at
such
a
moment
look
quickly
the
light
soon
fades
she
pointed
towards
the
east
her
companion
gazed
in
that
direction
and
uttered
an
exclamation
almost
a
shout
of
wonder
and
admiration
within
the
space
of
the
past
few
minutes
the
aspect
of
the
heavens
had
completely
changed
the
burning
scarlet
and
violet
hues
had
all
melted
into
a
transparent
yet
brilliant
shade
of
pale
mauve
as
delicate
as
the
inner
tint
of
a
lilac
blossom
and
across
this
stretched
two
gossamer
clouds
of
watery
green
fringed
with
soft
primrose
between
these
as
opaline
in
lustre
as
those
of
a
the
face
of
the
sun
shone
like
a
shield
of
polished
gold
while
his
rays
piercing
through
the
varied
tints
of
emerald
brought
an
unearthly
radiance
over
the
landscape
a
lustre
as
though
the
moon
were
in
some
strange
way
battling
with
the
sun
for
mastery
over
the
visible
universe
though
looking
southward
she
could
dimly
be
perceived
the
ghost
of
herself
a
poor
fainting
pallid
goddess
a
perishing
diana
bringing
his
glance
down
from
the
skies
the
young
man
turned
it
to
the
face
of
the
maiden
near
him
and
was
startled
at
her
marvellous
beauty
beauty
now
heightened
by
the
effect
of
the
changeful
colors
that
played
around
her
the
very
boat
in
which
she
sat
glittered
with
a
metallic
brightness
as
it
heaved
gently
to
and
fro
on
the
silvery
green
water
the
midnight
sunshine
bathed
the
falling
glory
of
her
long
hair
till
each
thick
tress
each
clustering
curl
appeared
to
emit
an
amber
spark
of
light
the
strange
weird
effect
of
the
sky
seemed
to
have
stolen
into
her
eyes
making
them
shine
with
brilliancy
the
varied
radiance
flashing
about
her
brought
into
strong
relief
the
pureness
of
her
profile
drawing
as
with
a
fine
pencil
the
outlines
of
her
noble
forehead
sweet
mouth
and
rounded
chin
it
touched
the
scarlet
of
her
bodice
and
brightened
the
quaint
old
silver
clasps
she
wore
at
her
waist
and
throat
till
she
seemed
no
longer
an
earthly
being
but
more
like
some
fair
wondering
sprite
from
the
legendary
norse
kingdom
of
the
abode
of
the
luminous
genii
she
was
gazing
upwards
heavenwards
and
her
expression
was
one
of
rapt
and
almost
devotional
intensity
thus
she
remained
for
some
moments
motionless
as
the
picture
of
an
expectant
angel
painted
by
raffaele
or
correggio
then
reluctantly
and
with
a
deep
sigh
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
earth
again
in
so
doing
she
met
the
fixed
and
too
visibly
admiring
gaze
of
her
companion
she
started
and
a
wave
of
vivid
color
flushed
her
cheeks
quickly
recovering
her
serenity
however
she
saluted
him
slightly
and
moving
her
oars
in
unison
was
on
the
point
of
departure
stirred
by
an
impulse
he
could
not
resist
he
laid
one
hand
detainingly
on
the
rim
of
her
boat
are
you
going
now
he
asked
she
raised
her
eyebrows
in
some
little
surprise
and
smiled
going
she
repeated
why
yes
i
shall
be
late
in
getting
home
as
it
is
stop
a
moment
he
said
eagerly
feeling
that
he
could
not
let
this
beautiful
creature
leave
him
as
utterly
as
a
midsummer
night
dream
without
some
clue
as
to
her
origin
and
destination
will
you
not
tell
me
your
name
she
drew
herself
erect
with
a
look
of
indignation
sir
i
do
not
know
you
the
maidens
of
norway
do
not
give
their
names
to
strangers
pardon
me
he
replied
somewhat
abashed
i
mean
no
offense
we
have
watched
the
midnight
sun
together
and
and
i
thought
he
paused
feeling
very
foolish
and
unable
to
conclude
his
sentence
she
looked
at
him
demurely
from
under
her
long
curling
lashes
you
will
often
find
a
peasant
girl
on
the
shores
of
the
altenfjord
watching
the
midnight
sun
at
the
same
time
as
yourself
she
said
and
there
was
a
suspicion
of
laughter
in
her
voice
it
is
not
unusual
it
is
not
even
necessary
that
you
should
remember
so
little
a
thing
necessary
or
not
i
shall
never
forget
it
he
said
with
sudden
impetuosity
you
are
no
peasant
come
if
i
give
you
my
name
will
you
still
deny
me
yours
her
delicate
brows
drew
together
in
a
frown
of
haughty
and
decided
refusal
no
names
please
my
ears
save
those
that
are
familiar
she
said
with
intense
coldness
we
shall
not
meet
again
farewell
and
without
further
word
or
look
she
leaned
gracefully
to
the
oars
and
pulling
with
a
long
steady
resolute
stroke
the
little
boat
darted
away
as
lightly
and
swiftly
as
a
skimming
swallow
out
on
the
shimmering
water
he
stood
gazing
after
it
till
it
became
a
distant
speck
sparkling
like
a
diamond
in
the
light
of
sky
and
wave
and
when
he
could
no
more
watch
it
with
unassisted
eyes
he
took
up
his
field
glass
and
followed
its
course
attentively
he
saw
it
cutting
along
as
straightly
as
an
arrow
then
suddenly
it
dipped
round
to
the
westward
apparently
making
straight
for
some
shelving
rocks
that
projected
far
into
the
fjord
it
reached
them
it
grew
less
and
less
it
disappeared
at
the
same
time
the
lustre
of
the
heavens
gave
way
to
a
pale
uniform
grey
tint
that
stretched
far
and
wide
folding
up
as
in
a
mantle
all
the
regal
luxury
of
the
palace
the
subtle
odor
and
delicate
chill
of
the
coming
dawn
stole
freshly
across
the
water
a
light
haze
rose
and
obscured
the
opposite
islands
something
of
the
tender
melancholy
of
autumn
though
it
was
late
june
toned
down
the
aspect
of
the
before
brilliant
landscape
a
lark
rose
swiftly
from
its
nest
in
an
adjacent
meadow
and
soaring
higher
and
higher
poured
from
its
tiny
throat
a
cascade
of
delicious
melody
the
midnight
sun
no
longer
shone
at
midnight
his
face
smiled
with
a
sobered
serenity
through
the
faint
early
mists
of
approaching
morning

baffled
he
exclaimed
with
a
slight
vexed
laugh
as
the
boat
vanished
from
his
sight
by
a
woman
too
who
would
have
thought
it
who
would
have
thought
it
indeed
sir
philip
baronet
the
wealthy
and
desirable
parti
for
whom
many
mothers
had
stood
in
the
chilly
though
sparkling
waters
of
society
ardently
plying
rod
and
line
with
patient
persistence
vainly
hoping
to
secure
him
as
a
husband
for
one
of
their
highly
proper
and
passionless
daughters
he
the
admired
eligible
was
suddenly
rebuffed
flouted
by
whom
a
stray
princess
or
a
peasant
he
vaguely
wondered
as
he
lit
a
cigar
and
strolled
up
and
down
on
the
shore
meditating
with
a
puzzled
almost
annoyed
expression
on
his
handsome
features
he
was
not
accustomed
to
slights
of
any
kind
however
trifling
his
position
being
commanding
and
enviable
enough
to
attract
flattery
and
friendship
from
most
people
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
baronet
as
renowned
for
eccentricity
as
for
wealth
he
had
been
the
spoilt
darling
of
his
mother
and
now
both
his
parents
being
dead
he
was
alone
in
the
world
heir
to
his
father
revenues
and
entire
master
of
his
own
actions
and
as
part
of
the
penalty
he
had
to
pay
for
being
rich
and
to
boot
he
was
so
much
run
after
by
women
that
he
found
it
hard
to
understand
the
haughty
indifference
with
which
he
had
just
been
treated
by
one
of
the
most
fair
if
not
the
fairest
of
her
sex
he
was
piqued
and
his
was
wounded
i
sure
my
question
was
harmless
enough
he
mused
half
crossly
she
might
have
answered
it
he
glanced
out
impatiently
over
the
fjord
there
was
no
sign
of
his
returning
yacht
as
yet
what
a
time
those
fellows
are
he
said
to
himself
if
the
pilot
were
not
on
board
i
should
begin
to
think
they
had
run
the
aground
he
finished
his
cigar
and
threw
the
end
of
it
into
the
water
then
he
stood
moodily
watching
the
ripples
as
they
rolled
softly
up
and
caressed
the
shining
brown
shore
at
his
feet
thinking
all
the
while
of
that
strange
girl
so
wonderfully
lovely
in
face
and
form
so
graceful
and
proud
of
bearing
with
her
great
blue
eyes
and
masses
of
dusky
gold
hair
his
meeting
with
her
was
a
sort
of
adventure
in
its
way
the
first
of
the
kind
he
had
had
for
some
time
he
was
subject
to
fits
of
weariness
or
caprice
and
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
he
had
suddenly
left
london
in
the
height
of
the
season
and
had
started
for
norway
on
a
yachting
cruise
with
three
chosen
companions
one
of
whom
george
lorimer
once
an
oxford
was
now
his
chum
the
pythias
to
his
damon
the
of
his
closest
confidence
through
the
unexpected
wakening
up
of
energy
in
the
latter
young
gentleman
who
was
usually
of
a
most
sleepy
and
indolent
disposition
he
happened
to
be
quite
alone
on
this
particular
occasion
though
as
a
general
rule
he
was
accompanied
in
his
rambles
by
one
if
not
all
three
of
his
friends
utter
solitude
was
with
him
a
rare
occurrence
and
his
present
experience
of
it
had
chanced
in
this
wise
lorimer
the
languid
lorimer
the
lazy
lorimer
who
had
remained
blandly
unmoved
and
drowsy
through
all
the
magnificent
panorama
of
the
norwegian
coast
including
the
sogne
fjord
and
the
toppling
peaks
of
the
justedal
glaciers
lorimer
who
had
slept
peacefully
in
a
hammock
on
deck
even
while
the
yacht
was
passing
under
the
looming
splendors
of
melsnipa
lorimer
now
that
he
had
arrived
at
the
alton
fjord
then
at
its
loveliest
in
the
full
glory
of
the
continuous
sunshine
developed
a
new
turn
of
mind
and
began
to
show
sudden
and
abnormal
interest
in
the
scenery
in
this
humor
he
expressed
his
desire
to
take
a
sight
of
the
midnight
sun
from
the
island
of
seiland
and
also
declared
his
resolve
to
try
the
nearly
impossible
ascent
of
the
great
jedkè
glacier
errington
laughed
at
the
idea
do
tell
me
he
said
that
you
are
going
in
for
climbing
and
do
you
suppose
i
believe
that
you
are
interested
of
all
people
in
the
heavenly
bodies
why
not
asked
lorimer
with
a
candid
smile
i
not
in
the
least
interested
in
earthly
bodies
except
my
own
the
sun
a
jolly
fellow
i
sympathize
with
him
in
his
present
condition
he
in
his
cups
what
the
matter
and
he
ca
be
persuaded
to
go
to
bed
i
know
his
feelings
perfectly
and
i
want
to
survey
his
gloriously
inebriated
face
from
another
point
of
view
do
laugh
phil
i
in
earnest
and
i
really
have
quite
a
curiosity
to
try
my
skill
in
amateur
mountaineering
jedkè
the
very
place
for
a
first
effort
it
offers
difficulties
and
this
with
a
slight
yawn
i
like
to
surmount
difficulties
rather
amusing
his
mind
was
so
evidently
set
upon
the
excursion
that
sir
philip
made
no
attempt
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
excused
himself
from
accompanying
the
party
on
the
plea
that
he
wanted
to
finish
a
sketch
he
had
recently
begun
so
that
when
the
got
up
her
steam
weighed
anchor
and
swept
gracefully
away
towards
the
coast
of
the
adjacent
islands
her
owner
was
left
at
his
desire
to
the
seclusion
of
a
quiet
nook
on
the
shore
of
the
altenfjord
where
he
succeeded
in
making
a
bold
and
vivid
picture
of
the
scene
before
him
the
colors
of
the
sky
had
however
defied
his
palette
and
after
one
or
two
futile
attempts
to
transfer
to
his
canvas
a
few
of
the
gorgeous
tints
that
illumed
the
landscape
he
gave
up
the
task
in
despair
and
resigned
himself
to
the
far
of
absolute
enjoyment
from
his
half
pleasing
half
melancholy
reverie
the
voice
of
the
unknown
maiden
had
startled
him
and
now
now
she
had
left
him
to
resume
it
if
he
chose
left
him
in
chill
displeasure
with
a
cold
yet
brilliant
flash
of
something
like
scorn
in
her
wonderful
eyes
since
her
departure
the
scenery
in
some
unaccountable
way
seemed
less
attractive
to
him
the
songs
of
the
birds
who
were
all
awake
fell
on
inattentive
ears
he
was
haunted
by
her
face
and
voice
and
he
was
moreover
a
little
out
of
humor
with
himself
for
having
been
such
a
blunderer
as
to
give
her
offense
and
thus
leave
an
unfavorable
impression
on
her
mind
i
suppose
i
rude
he
considered
after
a
while
she
seemed
to
think
so
at
any
rate
by
jove
what
a
crushing
look
she
gave
me
a
peasant
not
she
if
she
had
said
she
was
an
empress
i
should
have
been
much
surprised
but
a
mere
common
peasant
with
that
regal
figure
and
those
white
hands
i
do
believe
it
perhaps
our
pilot
valdemar
knows
who
she
is
i
must
ask
him
all
at
once
he
bethought
himself
of
the
cave
whence
she
had
emerged
it
was
close
at
hand
a
natural
grotto
arched
and
apparently
lofty
he
resolved
to
explore
it
glancing
at
his
watch
he
saw
it
was
not
yet
one
in
the
morning
yet
the
voice
of
the
cuckoo
called
shrilly
from
the
neighboring
hills
and
a
circling
group
of
swallows
flitted
around
him
their
lovely
wings
glistening
like
jewels
in
the
warm
light
of
the
sun
going
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
he
looked
in
it
was
formed
of
rough
rock
hewn
out
by
the
silent
work
of
the
water
and
its
floor
was
strewn
thick
with
loose
pebbles
and
polished
stones
entering
it
he
was
able
to
walk
upright
for
some
few
paces
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
shrink
in
size
and
to
become
darker
the
light
from
the
opening
gradually
narrowed
into
a
slender
stream
too
small
for
him
to
see
clearly
where
he
was
going
thereupon
he
struck
a
fusee
at
first
he
could
observe
no
sign
of
human
habitation
not
even
a
rope
or
chain
or
hook
to
intimate
that
it
was
a
customary
shelter
for
a
boat
the
fusee
went
out
quickly
and
he
lit
another
looking
more
carefully
and
closely
about
him
he
perceived
on
a
projecting
shelf
of
rock
a
small
antique
lamp
etruscan
in
shape
made
of
iron
and
wrought
with
curious
letters
there
was
oil
in
it
and
a
wick
it
had
evidently
been
recently
used
he
availed
himself
at
once
of
this
useful
adjunct
to
his
explorations
and
lighting
it
was
able
by
the
clear
and
steady
flame
it
emitted
to
see
everything
very
distinctly
right
before
him
was
an
uneven
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
closed
door
he
paused
and
listened
attentively
there
was
no
sound
but
the
slow
lapping
of
the
water
near
the
entrance
within
the
thickness
of
the
cavern
walls
shut
out
the
gay
carolling
of
the
birds
and
all
the
cheerful
noises
of
awakening
nature
silence
chillness
and
partial
obscurity
are
depressing
influences
and
the
warm
blood
flowing
through
his
veins
ran
a
trifle
more
slowly
and
coldly
as
he
felt
the
sort
of
uncomfortable
eerie
sensation
which
is
experienced
by
the
jolliest
and
most
careless
traveller
when
he
first
goes
down
to
the
catacombs
in
rome
a
sort
of
damp
earthy
shudder
creeps
through
the
system
and
a
dreary
feeling
of
general
hopelessness
benumbs
the
faculties
a
morbid
state
of
body
and
mind
which
is
only
to
be
remedied
by
a
speedy
return
to
the
warm
sunlight
and
a
draught
of
generous
wine
sir
philip
however
held
the
antique
lamp
aloft
and
descended
the
clumsy
steps
cautiously
counting
twenty
steps
in
all
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
closed
door
it
was
made
of
hard
wood
so
hard
as
to
be
almost
like
iron
it
was
black
with
age
and
covered
with
quaint
carvings
and
inscriptions
but
in
the
middle
standing
out
in
bold
relief
among
the
numberless
runic
figures
and
devices
was
written
in
large
letters
the
word
thelma
by
jove
he
exclaimed
i
have
it
the
girl
name
of
course
this
is
some
private
retreat
of
hers
i
suppose
a
kind
of
boudoir
like
my
lady
winsleigh
only
with
rather
a
difference
and
he
laughed
aloud
thinking
of
the
dainty
hangings
of
a
certain
room
in
a
certain
great
mansion
in
park
lane
where
an
aristocratic
and
handsome
of
fashion
had
as
nearly
made
love
to
him
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
do
without
losing
her
social
dignity
his
laugh
was
echoed
back
with
a
weird
and
hollow
sound
as
though
a
hidden
demon
of
the
cave
were
mocking
him
a
demon
whose
merriment
was
intense
but
also
horrible
he
heard
the
unpleasant
jeering
repetition
with
a
kind
of
careless
admiration
that
echo
would
make
a
fortune
in
if
it
could
be
persuaded
to
back
up
mephistopheles
with
that
truly
fiendish
he
said
resuming
his
examination
of
the
name
on
the
door
then
an
odd
fancy
seized
him
and
he
called
loudly
thelma
thelma
shouted
the
echo
is
that
her
name
her
name
replied
the
echo
i
thought
so
and
philip
laughed
again
while
the
echo
laughed
wildly
in
answer
just
the
sort
of
name
to
suit
a
norwegian
nymph
or
goddess
is
quaint
and
appropriate
and
as
far
as
i
can
remember
no
rhyme
to
it
in
the
english
language
and
he
lingered
on
the
pronunciation
of
the
strange
word
with
a
curious
sensation
of
pleasure
there
is
something
mysteriously
suggestive
about
the
sound
of
it
like
a
chord
of
music
played
softly
in
the
distance
now
can
i
get
through
this
door
i
wonder
he
pushed
it
gently
it
yielded
very
slightly
and
he
tried
again
and
yet
again
finally
he
put
down
the
lamp
and
set
his
shoulder
against
the
wooden
barrier
with
all
his
force
a
dull
creaking
sound
rewarded
his
efforts
and
inch
by
inch
the
huge
door
opened
into
what
at
first
appeared
immeasurable
darkness
holding
up
the
light
he
looked
in
and
uttered
a
smothered
exclamation
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
rushed
from
the
sea
through
the
passage
and
extinguished
the
lamp
leaving
him
in
profound
gloom
nothing
daunted
he
sought
his
fusee
case
there
was
just
one
left
in
it
this
he
hastily
struck
and
shielding
the
glow
carefully
with
one
hand
relit
his
lamp
and
stepped
boldly
into
the
mysterious
grotto
the
murmur
of
the
wind
and
waves
like
in
unison
followed
him
as
he
entered
he
found
himself
in
a
spacious
winding
corridor
that
had
evidently
been
hollowed
out
in
the
rocks
and
fashioned
by
human
hands
its
construction
was
after
the
ancient
gothic
method
but
the
wonder
of
the
place
consisted
in
the
walls
which
were
entirely
covered
with
shells
shells
of
every
shape
and
hue
some
delicate
as
some
rough
and
prickly
others
polished
as
ivory
some
gleaming
with
a
thousand
irridescent
colors
others
pure
white
as
the
foam
on
high
billows
many
of
them
were
turned
artistically
in
such
a
position
as
to
show
their
inner
sides
glistening
with
soft
tints
like
the
shades
of
fine
silk
or
satin
others
glittered
with
the
opaline
sheen
of
all
were
arranged
in
exquisite
patterns
evidently
copied
from
fixed
mathematical
designs
there
were
stars
crescents
roses
sunflowers
hearts
crossed
daggers
ships
and
implements
of
war
all
faithfully
depicted
with
extraordinary
neatness
and
care
as
though
each
particular
emblem
had
served
some
special
purpose
sir
philip
walked
along
very
slowly
delighted
with
his
discovery
and
pausing
to
examine
each
panel
as
he
passed
amused
himself
with
speculations
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
beautiful
cavern
so
fancifully
yet
skillfully
decorated
some
old
place
of
worship
i
suppose
he
thought
there
must
be
many
such
hidden
in
different
parts
of
norway
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
christian
faith
for
among
all
these
devices
i
do
perceive
a
single
cross
he
was
right
there
were
no
crosses
but
there
were
many
designs
of
the
sun
the
sun
rising
the
sun
setting
the
sun
in
full
glory
with
all
his
rays
embroidered
round
him
in
tiny
shells
some
of
them
no
bigger
than
a
pin
head
what
a
waste
of
time
and
labor
he
mused
who
would
undertake
such
a
thing
nowadays
fancy
the
patience
and
delicacy
of
finger
required
to
fit
all
these
shells
in
their
places
and
they
are
embedded
in
strong
mortar
too
as
if
the
work
were
meant
to
be
indestructible
full
of
pleased
interest
he
pursued
his
way
winding
in
and
out
through
different
arches
all
more
or
less
richly
ornamented
till
he
came
to
a
tall
round
column
which
seemingly
supported
the
whole
gallery
for
all
the
arches
converged
towards
it
it
was
garlanded
from
top
to
bottom
with
their
roses
and
their
leaves
all
worked
in
pink
and
lilac
shells
interspersed
with
small
pieces
of
shining
amber
and
polished
malachite
the
flicker
of
the
lamp
he
carried
made
it
glisten
like
a
mass
of
and
absorbed
in
his
close
examination
of
this
unique
specimen
of
ancient
art
sir
philip
did
not
at
once
perceive
that
another
light
beside
his
own
glimmered
from
out
the
furthest
archway
a
little
beyond
him
an
opening
that
led
into
some
recess
he
had
not
as
yet
explored
a
peculiar
lustre
sparkling
on
one
side
of
the
however
at
last
attracted
his
attention
and
glancing
up
quickly
he
saw
to
his
surprise
the
reflection
of
a
strange
radiance
rosily
tinted
and
brilliant
turning
in
its
direction
he
paused
irresolute
could
there
be
some
one
living
in
that
furthest
chamber
to
which
the
long
passage
he
had
followed
evidently
led
some
one
who
would
perhaps
resent
his
intrusion
as
an
impertinence
some
eccentric
artist
or
hermit
who
had
made
the
cave
his
home
or
was
it
perhaps
a
refuge
for
smugglers
he
listened
anxiously
there
was
no
sound
he
waited
a
minute
or
two
then
boldly
advanced
determined
to
solve
the
mystery
this
last
archway
was
lower
than
any
of
those
he
had
passed
through
and
he
was
forced
to
take
off
his
hat
and
stoop
as
he
went
under
it
when
he
raised
his
head
he
remained
uncovered
for
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
place
was
sacred
he
was
in
the
presence
not
of
life
but
death
the
chamber
in
which
he
stood
was
square
in
form
and
more
richly
ornamented
with
than
any
other
portion
of
the
grotto
he
had
seen
and
facing
the
east
was
an
altar
hewn
out
of
the
solid
rock
and
studded
thickly
with
amber
malachite
and
it
was
covered
with
the
incomprehensible
emblems
of
a
bygone
creed
worked
in
most
exquisite
but
on
it
as
though
in
solemn
protest
against
the
past
stood
a
crucifix
of
ebony
and
carved
ivory
before
which
burned
steadily
a
red
lamp
the
meaning
of
the
mysterious
light
was
thus
explained
but
what
chiefly
interested
errington
was
the
central
object
of
the
place
a
coffin
of
rather
a
plain
granite
sarcophagus
which
was
placed
on
the
floor
lying
from
north
to
south
upon
it
in
strange
contrast
to
the
sombre
coldness
of
the
stone
reposed
a
large
wreath
of
poppies
freshly
gathered
the
vivid
scarlet
of
the
flowers
the
gleam
of
the
shining
shells
on
the
walls
the
mournful
figure
of
the
ivory
christ
stretched
on
the
cross
among
all
those
pagan
emblems
the
intense
silence
broken
only
by
the
slow
drip
drip
of
water
trickling
somewhere
behind
the
cavern
and
more
than
these
outward
things
his
own
impressive
conviction
that
he
was
with
the
imperial
dead
imperial
because
past
the
sway
of
empire
all
made
a
powerful
impression
on
his
mind
overcoming
by
degrees
his
first
sensations
of
awe
he
approached
the
sarcophagus
and
examined
it
it
was
solidly
closed
and
mortared
all
round
so
that
it
might
have
been
one
compact
block
of
stone
so
far
as
its
outward
appearance
testified
stooping
more
closely
however
to
look
at
the
brilliant
he
started
back
with
a
slight
exclamation
cut
deeply
in
the
hard
granite
he
read
for
the
second
time
that
odd
name
thelma
it
belonged
to
some
one
dead
then
not
to
the
lovely
living
woman
who
had
so
lately
confronted
him
in
the
burning
glow
of
the
midnight
sun
he
felt
dismayed
at
his
unthinking
precipitation
he
had
in
his
fancy
actually
associated
so
full
of
radiant
health
and
beauty
with
what
was
probably
a
mouldering
corpse
in
that
hermetically
sealed
tenement
of
stone
this
idea
was
unpleasant
and
jarred
upon
his
feelings
surely
she
that
nymph
of
the
fjord
had
nothing
to
do
with
death
he
had
evidently
found
his
way
into
some
ancient
tomb
thelma
might
be
the
name
or
title
of
some
queen
or
princess
of
norway
yet
if
so
how
came
the
crucifix
there
the
red
lamp
the
flowers
he
lingered
looking
curiously
about
him
as
if
he
fancied
the
walls
might
whisper
some
answer
to
his
thoughts
the
silence
offered
no
suggestions
the
plaintive
figure
of
the
tortured
christ
suspended
on
the
cross
maintained
an
immovable
watch
over
all
things
and
there
was
a
subtle
faint
odor
floating
about
as
of
crushed
spices
or
herbs
while
he
still
stood
there
absorbed
in
perplexed
conjectures
he
became
oppressed
by
want
of
air
the
red
hue
of
the
mingled
with
the
softer
glow
of
the
lamp
on
the
altar
the
moist
glitter
of
the
shells
and
polished
pebbles
seemed
to
dazzle
and
confuse
his
eyes
he
felt
dizzy
and
faint
and
hastily
made
his
way
out
of
that
close
into
the
passage
where
he
leaned
for
a
few
minutes
against
the
great
central
column
to
recover
himself
a
brisk
breath
of
wind
from
the
fjord
came
careering
through
the
gallery
and
blew
coldly
upon
his
forehead
refreshed
by
it
he
rapidly
overcame
the
sensation
of
giddiness
and
began
to
retrace
his
steps
through
the
winding
arches
thinking
with
some
satisfaction
as
he
went
what
a
romantic
incident
he
would
have
to
relate
to
lorimer
and
his
other
friends
when
a
sudden
glare
of
light
illumined
the
passage
and
he
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
standstill
by
the
sound
of
a
wild
halloo
the
light
vanished
it
reappeared
it
vanished
again
and
again
appeared
flinging
a
strong
flare
upon
the
walls
as
it
approached
again
the
fierce
halloo
resounded
through
the
hollow
cavities
of
the
subterranean
temple
and
he
remained
motionless
waiting
for
an
explanation
of
this
turn
to
the
events
of
the
morning
he
had
plenty
of
physical
courage
and
the
idea
of
any
addition
to
his
adventure
rather
pleased
him
than
otherwise
still
with
all
his
bravery
he
recoiled
a
little
when
he
first
caught
sight
of
the
extraordinary
being
that
emerged
from
the
darkness
a
wild
distorted
figure
that
ran
towards
him
with
its
head
downwards
bearing
aloft
in
one
skinny
hand
a
smoking
from
which
the
sparks
flew
like
so
many
fireflies
this
uncanny
personage
wearing
the
semblance
of
man
came
within
two
paces
of
errington
before
perceiving
him
then
stopping
short
in
his
headlong
career
the
creature
flourished
his
torch
and
uttered
a
defiant
yell
philip
surveyed
him
coolly
and
without
alarm
though
so
weird
an
object
might
well
have
aroused
a
pardonable
distrust
and
even
timidity
he
saw
a
misshapen
dwarf
not
quite
four
feet
high
with
large
ungainly
limbs
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
head
which
was
small
and
compact
his
features
were
of
almost
feminine
fineness
and
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
gleamed
a
restless
pair
of
large
full
wild
blue
eyes
his
thick
rough
flaxen
hair
was
long
and
curly
and
hung
in
disordered
profusion
over
his
deformed
shoulders
his
dress
was
of
reindeer
skin
very
fancifully
cut
and
ornamented
with
beads
of
different
colors
and
twisted
about
him
as
though
in
an
effort
to
be
artistic
was
a
long
strip
of
bright
scarlet
woollen
material
which
showed
up
the
extreme
pallor
and
of
the
meagre
countenance
and
the
brilliancy
of
the
eyes
that
now
sparkled
with
rage
as
they
met
those
of
errington
he
from
his
superior
height
glanced
down
with
pity
on
the
unfortunate
creature
whom
he
at
once
took
to
be
the
actual
owner
of
the
cave
he
had
explored
uncertain
what
to
do
whether
to
speak
or
remain
silent
he
moved
slightly
as
though
to
pass
on
but
the
dwarf
leaped
lightly
in
his
way
and
planting
himself
firmly
before
him
shrieked
some
unintelligible
threat
of
which
errington
could
only
make
out
the
last
words
nifleheim
and
nastrond
i
believe
he
is
commending
me
to
the
old
norwegian
inferno
thought
the
young
baronet
with
a
smile
amused
at
the
little
man
evident
excitement
very
polite
of
him
i
sure
but
after
all
i
had
no
business
here
i
better
apologize
and
forthwith
he
began
to
speak
in
the
simplest
english
words
he
could
choose
taking
care
to
pronounce
them
very
slowly
and
distinctly
i
can
not
understand
you
my
good
sir
but
i
see
you
are
angry
i
came
here
by
accident
i
am
going
away
now
at
once
his
explanation
had
a
strange
effect
the
dwarf
drew
nearer
twirled
himself
rapidly
round
three
times
as
though
waltzing
then
holding
his
torch
a
little
to
one
side
turned
up
his
thin
pale
countenance
and
fixing
his
gaze
on
sir
philip
studied
every
feature
of
his
face
with
absorbing
interest
then
he
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
at
last
at
last
he
cried
in
fluent
english
going
now
going
you
say
never
never
you
will
never
go
away
any
more
no
not
without
something
stolen
the
dead
have
summoned
you
here
their
white
bony
fingers
have
dragged
you
across
the
deep
did
you
not
hear
their
voices
cold
and
hollow
as
the
winter
wind
calling
calling
you
and
saying
come
proud
robber
from
over
the
far
seas
come
and
gather
the
beautiful
rose
of
the
northern
forest
yes
yes
you
have
obeyed
the
dead
the
dead
who
feign
sleep
but
are
ever
wakeful
you
have
come
as
a
thief
in
the
golden
midnight
and
the
thing
you
seek
is
the
life
of
sigurd
yes
yes
it
is
true
the
spirit
can
not
lie
you
must
kill
you
must
steal
see
how
the
blood
drips
drop
by
drop
from
the
heart
of
sigurd
and
the
jewel
you
steal
ah
what
a
jewel
you
shall
not
find
such
another
in
norway
his
excited
voice
sank
by
degrees
to
a
plaintive
and
forlorn
whisper
and
dropping
his
torch
with
a
gesture
of
despair
on
the
ground
he
looked
at
it
burning
with
an
air
of
mournful
and
utter
desolation
profoundly
touched
as
he
immediately
understood
the
condition
of
his
companion
wandering
wits
errington
spoke
to
him
soothingly
you
mistake
me
he
said
in
gentle
accents
i
would
not
steal
anything
from
you
nor
have
i
come
to
kill
you
see
and
he
held
out
his
hand
i
would
harm
you
for
the
world
i
did
know
this
cave
belonged
to
you
forgive
me
for
having
entered
it
i
am
going
to
rejoin
my
friends
the
strange
creature
touched
his
outstretched
hand
timidly
and
with
a
sort
of
appeal
he
muttered
that
is
what
they
all
say
even
the
dead
but
they
never
go
never
never
you
can
not
be
different
to
the
rest
and
you
do
not
wish
to
hurt
poor
sigurd
certainly
not
if
are
sigurd
said
philip
half
laughing
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
hurt
you
you
are
he
persisted
with
a
sort
of
obstinate
eagerness
you
have
eyes
which
tell
truths
but
there
are
other
things
which
are
truer
than
eyes
things
in
the
air
in
the
grass
in
the
waves
and
they
talk
very
strangely
of
you
i
know
you
of
course
i
knew
you
ages
ago
long
before
i
saw
you
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
and
the
valkyrie
galloped
with
you
to
valhalla
yes
i
knew
you
long
before
that
and
you
knew
me
for
i
was
your
king
and
you
were
my
vassal
wild
and
rebellious
not
the
proud
rich
englishman
you
are
errington
startled
how
could
this
sigurd
as
he
called
himself
be
aware
of
either
his
wealth
or
nationality
the
dwarf
observed
his
movement
of
surprise
with
a
cunning
smile
sigurd
is
wise
sigurd
is
brave
who
shall
deceive
him
he
knows
you
well
he
will
always
know
you
the
old
gods
teach
sigurd
all
his
wisdom
the
gods
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
the
sleepy
gods
that
lie
in
the
hearts
of
the
flowers
the
small
spirits
that
sit
in
shells
and
sing
all
day
and
all
night
he
paused
and
his
eyes
filled
with
a
wistful
look
of
attention
he
drew
closer
come
he
said
earnestly
come
you
must
listen
to
my
music
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
what
it
means
he
picked
up
his
smouldering
torch
and
held
it
aloft
again
then
beckoning
errington
to
follow
him
he
led
the
way
to
a
small
grotto
cut
deeply
into
the
wall
of
the
cavern
here
there
were
no
shell
patterns
little
green
ferns
grew
thickly
out
of
the
stone
crevices
and
a
minute
runlet
of
water
trickled
slowly
down
from
above
freshening
the
delicate
frondage
as
it
fell
with
quick
agile
fingers
he
removed
a
loose
stone
from
this
aperture
and
as
he
did
so
a
low
shuddering
wail
resounded
through
the
arches
a
melancholy
moan
that
rose
and
sank
and
rose
again
in
weird
sorrowful
minor
echoes
hear
her
murmured
sigurd
plaintively
she
is
always
complaining
it
is
a
pity
she
can
not
rest
she
is
a
spirit
you
know
i
have
often
asked
her
what
troubles
her
but
she
will
not
tell
me
she
only
weeps
his
companion
looked
at
him
compassionately
the
sound
that
so
affected
his
disordered
imagination
was
nothing
but
the
wind
blowing
through
the
narrow
hole
formed
by
the
removal
of
the
stone
but
it
was
useless
to
explain
this
simple
fact
to
one
in
his
condition
tell
me
and
sir
philip
spoke
very
gently
is
this
your
home
the
dwarf
surveyed
him
almost
scornfully
home
he
echoed
my
home
is
everywhere
on
the
mountains
in
the
forests
on
the
black
rocks
and
barren
shores
my
soul
lives
between
the
sun
and
the
sea
my
heart
is
with
thelma
thelma
here
was
perhaps
a
clue
to
the
mystery
who
is
thelma
asked
errington
somewhat
hurriedly
sigurd
broke
into
violent
and
derisive
laughter
do
you
think
i
will
tell
he
cried
loudly
one
of
that
strong
cruel
race
who
must
conquer
all
they
see
who
covet
everything
fair
under
heaven
and
will
buy
it
even
at
the
cost
of
blood
and
tears
do
you
think
i
will
unlock
the
door
of
my
treasure
to
no
no
besides
and
his
voice
sank
lower
what
should
you
do
with
thelma
she
is
dead
and
as
if
possessed
by
a
sudden
access
of
frenzy
he
brandished
his
wildly
above
his
head
till
it
showered
a
rain
of
bright
sparks
above
him
and
exclaimed
furiously
away
away
and
trouble
me
not
the
days
are
not
yet
fulfilled
the
time
is
not
yet
ripe
why
seek
to
hasten
my
end
away
away
i
tell
you
leave
me
in
peace
i
will
die
when
thelma
bids
me
but
not
till
then
and
he
rushed
down
the
long
gallery
and
disappeared
in
the
furthest
chamber
where
he
gave
vent
to
a
sort
of
long
sobbing
cry
which
rang
dolefully
through
the
cavern
and
then
subsided
into
utter
silence
feeling
as
if
he
were
in
a
chaotic
dream
errington
pursued
his
interrupted
course
through
the
winding
passages
with
a
bewildered
and
wondering
mind
what
strange
place
had
he
inadvertently
lighted
on
and
who
were
the
still
stranger
beings
in
connection
with
it
first
the
beautiful
girl
herself
next
the
mysterious
coffin
hidden
in
its
fanciful
shell
temple
and
now
this
deformed
madman
with
the
pale
face
and
fine
eyes
whose
utterances
though
incoherent
savored
somewhat
of
poesy
and
prophecy
and
what
spell
was
attached
to
that
name
of
thelma
the
more
he
thought
of
his
morning
adventure
the
more
puzzled
he
became
as
a
rule
he
believed
more
in
the
commonplace
than
in
the
romantic
most
people
do
but
truth
to
tell
romance
is
far
more
common
than
the
commonplace
there
are
few
who
have
not
at
one
time
or
other
of
their
lives
had
some
strange
or
tragic
episode
woven
into
the
tissue
of
their
existence
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
one
person
even
among
humdrum
individuals
who
from
birth
to
death
has
experienced
nothing
out
of
the
common
errington
generally
dismissed
all
tales
of
adventure
as
mere
exaggerations
of
heated
fancy
and
had
he
read
in
some
book
of
a
respectable
yachtsman
having
such
an
interview
with
a
madman
in
a
he
would
have
laughed
at
the
affair
as
an
utter
improbability
though
he
could
not
have
explained
why
he
considered
it
improbable
but
now
it
had
occurred
to
himself
he
was
both
surprised
and
amused
at
the
whole
circumstance
moreover
he
was
sufficiently
interested
and
curious
to
be
desirous
of
sifting
the
matter
to
its
foundation
it
was
however
somewhat
of
a
relief
to
him
when
he
again
reached
the
outer
cavern
he
replaced
the
lamp
on
the
shelf
where
he
had
found
it
and
stepped
once
more
into
the
brilliant
light
of
the
very
early
dawn
which
then
had
all
the
splendor
of
full
morning
there
was
a
deliciously
balmy
wind
the
blue
sky
was
musical
with
a
chorus
of
larks
and
every
breath
of
air
that
waved
aside
the
long
grass
sent
forth
a
thousand
odors
from
hidden
beds
of
wild
thyme
and
he
perceived
the
at
anchor
in
her
old
place
on
the
fjord
she
had
returned
while
he
was
absent
on
his
explorations
gathering
together
his
rug
and
painting
materials
he
blew
a
whistle
sharply
three
times
he
was
answered
from
the
yacht
and
presently
a
boat
manned
by
a
couple
of
sailors
came
skimming
over
the
water
towards
him
it
soon
reached
the
shore
and
entering
it
he
was
speedily
rowed
away
from
the
scene
of
his
morning
experience
back
to
his
floating
palace
where
as
yet
none
of
his
friends
were
stirring
how
about
jedkè
he
inquired
of
one
of
his
men
did
they
climb
it
a
slow
grin
overspread
the
sailor
brown
face
lord
bless
you
no
sir
lorimer
he
just
looked
at
it
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
the
other
gentleman
played
with
pebbles
they
was
main
hungry
too
and
ate
a
mighty
sight
of
and
pickles
then
they
came
on
board
and
all
turned
in
at
once
errington
laughed
he
was
amused
at
the
utter
failure
of
recent
sudden
energy
but
not
surprised
his
thoughts
were
however
busied
with
something
else
and
he
next
asked
where
our
pilot
valdemar
svensen
sir
he
went
down
to
his
bunk
as
soon
as
we
anchored
for
a
snooze
he
said
all
right
if
he
comes
on
deck
before
i
do
just
tell
him
not
to
go
ashore
for
anything
till
i
see
him
i
want
to
speak
to
him
after
breakfast
ay
ay
sir
whereupon
sir
philip
descended
to
his
private
cabin
he
drew
the
blind
at
the
to
shut
out
the
dazzling
sunlight
for
it
was
nearly
three
in
the
morning
and
quickly
undressing
he
flung
himself
into
his
berth
with
a
slight
not
altogether
unpleasant
feeling
of
exhaustion
to
the
last
as
his
eyes
closed
drowsily
he
seemed
to
hear
the
slow
drip
drip
of
the
water
behind
the
rocky
cavern
and
the
desolate
cry
of
the
incomprehensible
sigurd
while
through
these
sounds
that
mingled
with
the
gurgle
of
little
waves
lapping
against
the
sides
of
the
the
name
of
thelma
murmured
itself
in
his
ears
till
slumber
drowned
his
senses
in
oblivion
chapter
iii
hast
any
mortal
name
fit
appellation
for
this
dazzling
frame
or
friends
or
kinsfolk
on
the
citied
earth
keats
this
is
positively
absurd
murmured
lorimer
in
mildly
injured
tones
seven
hours
later
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
berth
surveying
errington
who
fully
dressed
and
in
the
highest
spirits
had
burst
in
to
upbraid
him
for
his
laziness
while
he
was
yet
but
scantily
attired
i
tell
you
my
good
fellow
there
are
some
things
which
the
utmost
stretch
of
friendship
will
stand
here
am
i
in
shirt
and
trousers
with
only
one
sock
on
and
you
dare
to
say
you
have
had
an
adventure
why
if
you
had
cut
a
piece
out
of
the
sun
you
ought
to
wait
till
a
man
is
shaved
before
mentioning
it
do
be
snappish
old
boy
laughed
errington
gaily
put
on
that
other
sock
and
listen
i
do
want
to
tell
those
other
fellows
just
yet
they
might
go
making
inquiries
about
her
oh
there
is
a
in
the
case
is
there
said
lorimer
opening
his
eyes
rather
widely
well
phil
i
thought
you
had
had
enough
and
something
too
much
of
women
this
is
not
a
woman
declared
philip
with
heat
and
eagerness
at
least
not
the
sort
of
woman
have
ever
known
this
is
a
or
i
do
know
she
is
upon
my
life
lorimer
regarded
him
with
an
air
of
reproachful
offense
do
go
on
please
do
he
implored
i
ca
stand
it
i
really
ca
incipient
is
too
much
for
me
by
jove
what
next
you
are
evidently
in
a
very
bad
way
if
i
remember
rightly
you
had
a
flask
of
that
old
green
chartreuse
with
you
ah
that
accounts
for
it
nice
stuff
but
a
little
too
strong
errington
laughed
and
unabashed
by
his
friend
raillery
proceeded
to
relate
with
much
vivacity
and
graphic
fervor
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
lorimer
listened
patiently
with
a
forbearing
smile
on
his
open
ruddy
countenance
when
he
had
heard
everything
he
looked
up
and
inquired
calmly
this
is
not
a
yarn
is
it
a
yarn
exclaimed
philip
do
you
think
i
would
invent
such
a
thing
ca
say
returned
lorimer
imperturbably
you
are
quite
capable
of
it
it
a
very
creditable
crammer
due
to
chartreuse
might
have
been
designed
by
victor
hugo
it
in
his
style
scene
norway
midnight
mysterious
maiden
steals
out
of
a
cave
and
glides
away
in
a
boat
over
the
water
man
the
hero
goes
into
cave
finds
a
stone
coffin
says
que

affreux
staggers
back
perspiring
meets
mad

with

mad
dwarf
talks
a
good
deal
mad
people
always
do
then
yells
and
runs
away
man
comes
out
of
cave
and
and
goes
home
to
astonish
his
friends
one
of
them
wo
be
astonished
that
me
i
do
care
said
errington
it
a
true
story
for
all
that
only
i
say
do
talk
of
it
before
the
others
let
keep
our
own
counsel
no
poachers
allowed
on
the
manor
interrupted
lorimer
gravely
philip
went
on
without
heeding
him
i
question
valdemar
svensen
after
breakfast
he
knows
everybody
about
here
come
and
have
a
smoke
on
deck
when
i
give
you
the
sign
and
we
him
lorimer
still
looked
incredulous
what
the
good
of
it
he
inquired
languidly
even
if
it
all
true
you
had
much
better
leave
this
goddess
or
whatever
you
call
her
alone
especially
if
she
has
any
mad
connections
what
do
want
with
her
nothing
declared
errington
though
hiss
color
heightened
nothing
i
assure
you
it
just
a
matter
of
curiosity
with
me
i
should
like
to
know
who
she
is
that
all
the
affair
wo
go
any
further
how
do
you
know
and
lorimer
began
to
brush
his
stiff
curly
hair
with
a
sort
of
vicious
vigor
how
can
you
tell
i
not
a
spiritualist
nor
any
sort
of
a
humbug
at
all
i
hope
but
i
sometimes
indulge
in
presentiments
before
we
started
on
this
cruise
i
was
haunted
by
that
dismal
old
ballad
of
sir
patrick
spens
king
daughter
of
norroway
is
thou
maun
bring
her
hame
and
here
you
have
found
her
or
so
it
appears
what
to
come
of
it
i
wonder
nothing
to
come
of
it
nothing
come
of
it
laughed
philip
as
i
told
you
she
said
she
was
a
peasant
there
the
make
haste
old
boy
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
and
he
left
his
friend
to
finish
dressing
and
entered
the
saloon
where
he
greeted
his
two
other
companions
alec
or
as
he
was
oftener
called
sandy
macfarlane
and
pierre
duprèz
the
former
an
oxford
student
the
latter
a
young
fellow
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
in
paris
and
with
whom
he
had
kept
up
a
constant
and
friendly
intercourse
a
greater
contrast
than
these
two
presented
could
scarcely
be
imagined
macfarlane
was
tall
and
ungainly
with
large
loose
joints
that
seemed
to
protrude
angularly
out
of
him
in
every
direction
duprèz
was
short
slight
and
wiry
with
a
dapper
and
by
no
means
ungraceful
figure
the
one
had
formal
manners
a
glasgow
accent
and
a
slow
infinitely
tedious
method
of
expressing
himself
the
other
was
full
of
restless
movement
and
pantomimic
gesture
and
being
proud
of
his
english
plunged
into
that
language
recklessly
making
it
curiously
light
and
flippant
though
picturesque
as
he
went
macfarlane
was
destined
to
become
a
shining
light
of
the
established
church
of
scotland
and
therefore
took
life
very
seriously
duprèz
was
the
spoilt
only
child
of
an
eminent
french
banker
and
had
very
little
to
do
but
enjoy
himself
and
that
he
did
most
thoroughly
without
any
calculation
or
care
for
the
future
on
all
points
of
taste
and
opinion
they
differed
widely
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
their
both
being
fellows
without
any
affectation
of
abnormal
vice
or
virtue
so
you
did
not
climb
jedkè
after
all
remarked
errington
laughingly
as
they
seated
themselves
at
the
breakfast
table
my
friend
what
would
you
cried
duprèz
i
have
not
said
that
i
will
climb
it
no
i
never
say
that
i
will
do
anything
because
i
not
sure
of
myself
how
can
i
be
it
is
that
lorimer
that
said
such
brave
words
see
we
arrive
we
behold
the
shore
all
black
great
vast
rocks
like
needles
and
higher
than
all
this
most
fierce
jedkè
bah
what
a
name
straight
as
the
spire
of
a
cathedral
one
must
be
a
fly
to
crawl
up
it
and
we
we
are
not
flies
no
lorimer
he
laugh
he
yawn
so
he
say
for
me
i
very
much
thank
you
and
then
we
watch
the
sun
ah
that
was
grand
glorious
beautiful
and
duprèz
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
in
ecstacy
what
did
think
about
it
sandy
asked
sir
philip
i
didna
think
much
responded
macfarlane
shortly
it
no
sae
grand
a
sight
as
a
sunset
in
skye
and
it
an
uncanny
business
to
see
the
sun
losin
a
his
poonctooality
and
remainin
stock
still
as
it
were
when
it
his
plain
duty
to
set
below
the
horizon
mysel
i
think
it
been
fair
it
unnatural
an
oot
o
the
common
say
what
ye
like
of
course
it
is
agreed
lorimer
who
just
then
sauntered
in
from
his
cabin
nature
most
unnatural
i
always
thought
so
tea
for
me
phil
please
coffee
wakes
me
up
too
suddenly
i
say
what
the
programme
fishing
in
the
alten
answered
errington
promptly
that
suits
me
perfectly
said
lorimer
as
he
leisurely
sipped
his
tea
i
an
excellent
fisher
i
hold
the
line
and
generally
forget
to
bait
it
then
while
it
trails
harmlessly
in
the
water
i
doze
thus
both
the
fish
and
i
are
happy
and
this
evening
went
on
errington
we
must
return
the
call
he
been
to
the
yacht
twice
we
bound
to
go
out
of
common
politeness
spare
us
good
lord
groaned
lorimer
what
a
delightfully
fat
man
is
that
good
religious
cried
duprèz
a
living
proof
of
the
healthiness
of
norway
he
not
a
native
put
in
macfarlane
he
frae
yorkshire
he
only
been
a
matter
of
three
months
here
filling
the
place
o
the
settled
meenister
who
awa
for
a
change
of
air
he
a
precious
specimen
of
a
humbug
anyhow
sighed
lorimer
drearily
however
i
be
civil
to
him
as
long
as
he
does
ask
me
to
hear
him
preach
at
that
suggestion
i
fight
him
he
soft
enough
to
bruise
easily
ye
just
too
lazy
to
fight
onybody
declared
macfarlane
lorimer
smiled
sweetly
thanks
awfully
i
dare
say
you
right
never
found
it
worth
while
as
yet
to
exert
myself
in
any
particular
direction
no
one
has
asked
me
to
exert
myself
no
one
wants
me
to
exert
myself
therefore
why
should
i
do
ye
want
to
get
on
in
the
world
asked
macfarlane
almost
brusquely
dear
me
no
what
an
exhausting
idea
get
on
in
the
world
what
for
i
have
five
hundred
a
year
and
when
my
mother
goes
over
to
the
majority
long
distant
be
that
day
for
i
very
fond
of
the
dear
old
lady
i
shall
have
five
thousand
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
any
sane
man
who
does
want
to
speculate
on
the
stock
exchange
case
my
good
mac
is
different
you
will
be
a
celebrated
scotch
divine
you
will
preach
to
a
crowd
of
pious
numskulls
about
predestination
and
so
forth
you
will
be
for
the
securing
of
seats
in
paradise
now
now
keep
calm
do
mind
me
it
only
a
figure
of
speech
and
the
numskulls
will
call
you
a
powerful
rousin
preacher
is
that
the
way
they
go
on
and
when
you
die
for
die
you
must
most
unfortunately
they
will
give
you
a
block
of
granite
if
they
can
make
up
their
minds
to
part
with
the
necessary
bawbees
with
your
name
prettily
engraved
thereon
that
all
very
nice
it
suits
some
people
it
would
suit
me
what
suit
you
queried
errington
you
find
everything
more
or
less
of
a
bore
ah
my
good
little
boy
broke
in
duprèz
paris
is
the
place
for
you
you
should
live
in
paris
of
that
you
would
never
fatigue
yourself
too
much
absinthe
secret
murder
and
suicidal
mania
returned
lorimer
meditatively
that
was
a
neat
idea
about
the
coffins
though
i
never
hoped
to
dine
off
a
coffin
ah
you
mean
the
taverne
de
exclaimed
duprèz
yes
the
divine
waitresses
wore
winding
sheets
and
the
wine
was
served
in
imitation
skulls
excellent
i
remember
the
tables
were
shaped
like
coffins
gude
lord
almighty
piously
murmured
macfarlane
what
a
fearsome
sicht
as
he
pronounced
these
words
with
an
unusually
marked
accent
duprèz
looked
inquiring
what
does
our
macfarlane
say
he
says
it
must
have
been
a
sicht
repeated
lorimer
with
even
a
stronger
accent
than
sanby
own
which
pierre
means
all
the
horrors
in
your
language
anything
you
like
that
is
sufficiently
terrible
point
du
cried
duprèz
energetically
it
was
charming
it
made
us
laugh
at
death
so
much
better
than
to
cry
and
there
was
a
delicious
child
in
a
brown
curls
laughing
eyes
and
little
mouth
ha
ha
but
she
was
well
worth
kissing
i
rather
follow
ma
own
funeral
than
kiss
a
lass
in
a
said
sandy
in
solemn
and
horrified
tones
it
just
awfu
to
think
on
but
see
my
friend
persisted
duprèz
you
would
not
be
permitted
to
follow
your
own
funeral
not
possible
you
permitted
to
kiss
the
pretty
one
in
the
it
possible
behold
the
difference
never
mind
the
taverne
de
just
now
said
errington
who
had
finished
his
breakfast
hurriedly
it
time
for
you
fellows
to
get
your
fishing
toggery
on
i
off
to
speak
to
the
pilot
and
away
he
went
followed
more
slowly
by
lorimer
who
though
he
pretended
indifference
was
rather
curious
to
know
more
if
possible
concerning
his
friend
adventure
of
the
morning
they
found
the
pilot
valdemar
svensen
leaning
at
his
ease
against
the
idle
wheel
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
eastern
sky
he
was
a
stalwart
specimen
of
norse
manhood
tall
and
strongly
built
with
thoughtful
dignified
features
and
keen
clear
hazel
eyes
his
chestnut
hair
plentifully
sprinkled
with
gray
clustered
thickly
over
a
broad
brow
that
was
deeply
furrowed
with
many
a
line
of
anxious
and
speculative
thought
and
the
forcible
brown
hand
that
rested
lightly
on
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
told
its
own
tale
of
hard
and
honest
labor
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
living
relative
had
valdemar
the
one
passion
of
his
heart
was
the
sea
sir
philip
errington
had
engaged
him
at
christiansund
hearing
of
him
there
as
a
man
to
whom
the
intricacies
of
the
fjords
and
the
dangers
of
coasts
were
more
familiar
than
a
straight
road
on
dry
lake
and
since
then
the
management
of
the
had
been
entirely
entrusted
to
him
though
an
eminently
practical
sailor
he
was
half
a
mystic
and
believed
in
the
wildest
legends
of
his
land
with
more
implicit
faith
than
many
christians
believe
in
their
sacred
doctrines
he
doffed
his
red
cap
respectfully
now
as
errington
and
lorimer
approached
smilingly
wishing
them
a
fair
day
sir
philip
offered
him
a
cigar
and
coming
to
the
point
at
once
asked
abruptly
i
say
svensen
are
there
any
pretty
girls
in
bosekop
the
pilot
drew
the
newly
lit
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
passed
his
rough
hand
across
his
forehead
in
a
sort
of
grave
perplexity
it
is
a
matter
in
which
i
am
foolish
he
said
at
last
for
my
ways
have
always
gone
far
from
the
ways
of
women
girls
there
are
plenty
i
suppose
but
he
mused
with
pondering
patience
for
awhile
then
a
broad
smile
broke
like
sunshine
over
his
embrowned
countenance
as
he
continued
now
gentlemen
i
do
remember
well
it
is
said
that
at
bosekop
yonder
are
to
be
found
some
of
the
homeliest
wenches
in
all
norway
errington
face
fell
at
this
reply
lorimer
turned
away
to
hide
the
mischievous
smile
that
came
on
his
lips
at
his
friend
discomfiture
i
it
was
that
chartreuse
he
thought
to
himself
that
and
the
midnight
nothing
else
what
went
on
philip
no
girls
at
all
about
here
eh
svensen
shook
his
head
still
smilingly
not
at
bosekop
sir
that
i
ever
heard
of
i
say
broke
in
lorimer
are
there
any
old
tombs
or
or
places
of
that
sort
close
by
worth
exploring
valdemar
svensen
answered
this
question
readily
almost
eagerly
no
sir
there
are
no
antiquities
of
any
sort
and
as
for
caves
there
are
plenty
but
only
the
natural
formations
of
the
sea
and
none
of
these
are
curious
or
beautiful
on
this
side
of
the
fjord
lorimer
poked
his
friend
secretly
in
the
ribs
you
been
dreaming
old
fellow
he
whispered
slyly
i
knew
it
was
a
crammer
errington
shook
him
off
can
you
tell
me
he
said
addressing
valdemar
again
in
distinct
accents
whether
there
is
any
place
person
or
thing
near
here
called
the
pilot
started
a
look
of
astonishment
and
fear
came
into
his
eyes
his
hand
went
instinctively
to
his
red
cap
as
though
in
deference
to
the
name
the
fröken
thelma
he
exclaimed
in
low
tones
is
it
possible
that
you
have
seen
her
ah
george
what
do
you
say
now
cried
errington
delightedly
yes
yes
valdemar
the
fröken
thelma
as
you
call
her
who
is
she
what
is
she
and
how
can
there
be
no
pretty
girls
in
bosekop
if
such
a
beautiful
creature
as
she
lives
there
valdemar
looked
troubled
and
vexed
truly
i
thought
not
of
the
maiden
he
said
gravely
is
not
for
me
to
speak
of
the
daughter
of
olaf
here
his
voice
sank
a
little
and
his
face
grew
more
and
more
sombre
pardon
me
sir
but
how
did
you
meet
her
by
accident
replied
errington
promptly
not
caring
to
relate
his
morning
adventure
for
the
pilot
benefit
is
she
some
great
personage
here
svensen
sighed
and
smiled
somewhat
dubiously
great
oh
no
not
what
you
would
call
great
her
father
olaf
güldmar
is
a
that
is
a
farmer
in
his
own
right
he
has
a
goodly
house
and
a
few
fair
acres
well
planted
and
tilled
also
he
pays
his
men
freely
but
those
that
work
for
him
are
all
he
sees
neither
he
nor
his
daughter
ever
visit
the
town
they
dwell
apart
and
have
nothing
in
common
with
their
neighbors
and
where
do
they
live
asked
lorimer
becoming
as
interested
as
he
had
formerly
been
incredulous
the
pilot
leaned
lightly
over
the
rail
of
the
deck
and
pointed
towards
the
west
you
see
that
great
rock
shaped
like
a
giant
helmet
and
behind
it
a
high
green
knoll
clustered
thick
with
birch
and
pine
they
nodded
assent
at
the
side
of
the
knoll
is
the
house
a
good
walk
from
the
outskirts
of
bosekop
should
you
ever
seek
to
rest
there
gentlemen
and
svensen
spoke
with
quiet
resolution
i
doubt
whether
you
will
receive
a
pleasant
welcome
and
he
looked
at
them
both
with
an
inquisitive
air
as
though
seeking
to
discover
their
intentions
is
that
so
drawled
lorimer
lazily
giving
his
friend
an
expressive
nudge
ah
sha
trouble
them
thanks
for
your
information
valdemar
we
do
intend
to
hunt
up
the
what
d
call
him
the
if
he
at
all
surly
hospitality
that
gives
you
greeting
and
a
dinner
for
nothing
that
what
suits
our
people
are
not
without
hospitality
said
the
pilot
with
a
touch
of
wistful
and
appealing
dignity
all
along
your
journey
gentlemen
you
have
been
welcomed
gladly
as
you
know
but
olaf
güldmar
is
not
like
the
rest
of
us
he
has
the
pride
and
fierceness
of
olden
days
his
manners
and
customs
are
different
and
few
like
him
he
is
much
feared
you
know
him
then
inquired
errington
carelessly
i
know
him
returned
valdemar
quietly
and
his
daughter
is
fair
as
the
sun
and
the
sea
but
it
is
not
my
place
to
speak
of
them
he
broke
off
and
after
a
slightly
embarrassed
pause
asked
will
the
herren
wish
to
sail
no
valdemar
answered
errington
indifferently
not
till
when
we
visit
the
kaa
fjord
if
the
weather
keeps
fair
very
good
sir
and
the
pilot
tacitly
avoiding
any
further
converse
with
his
employer
respecting
the
mysterious
thelma
and
her
equally
mysterious
father
turned
to
examine
the
wheel
and
compass
as
though
something
there
needed
his
earnest
attention
errington
and
lorimer
strolled
up
and
down
the
polished
white
deck
talking
in
low
tones
you
did
ask
him
about
the
coffin
and
the
dwarf
said
lorimer
no
because
i
believe
he
knows
nothing
of
either
and
it
would
be
news
to
him
which
i
not
bound
to
give
if
i
can
manage
to
see
the
girl
again
the
mystery
of
the
cave
may
explain
itself
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
errington
looked
meditative
nothing
at
present
we
go
fishing
with
the
others
but
i
tell
you
what
if
you
up
to
it
we
leave
duprèz
and
macfarlane
at
the
minister
house
this
evening
and
tell
them
to
wait
for
us
there
once
they
all
begin
to
chatter
they
never
know
how
time
goes
meanwhile
you
and
i
will
take
the
boat
and
row
over
in
search
of
this
farmer
abode
i
believe
there
a
short
cut
to
it
by
water
at
any
rate
i
know
the
way
went
know
the
way
she
went
home
with
her
maiden
posy
quoted
lorimer
with
a
laugh
you
are
hit
phil
very
palpable
hit
who
would
have
thought
it
clara
winsleigh
need
poison
her
husband
after
all
to
marry
you
for
nothing
but
a
will
suit
you
now
do
be
a
fool
george
said
errington
half
vexedly
as
the
hot
color
mounted
to
his
face
in
spite
of
himself
it
is
all
idle
curiosity
nothing
else
after
what
svensen
told
us
i
quite
as
anxious
to
see
this
gruff
old
as
his
daughter
lorimer
held
up
a
reproachful
finger
now
phil
do
stoop
to
duplicity
not
with
me
at
any
rate
why
disguise
your
feelings
why
as
the
tragedians
say
endeavor
to
crush
the
noblest
and
best
emotions
that
ever
warm
the
of
man
chivalrous
sentiment
and
admiration
for
beauty
chivalrous
desire
to
pursue
it
and
catch
it
and
call
it
your
own
i
understand
it
all
my
dear
boy
but
my
prophetic
soul
tells
me
you
will
have
to
strangle
the
excellent
olaf
güldmar
heavens
what
a
name
before
you
will
be
allowed
to
make
love
to
his
fair
then
do
forget
the
madman
with
the
torch
he
may
turn
up
in
the
most
unexpected
fashion
and
give
you
no
end
of
trouble
but
by
jove
it
a
romantic
affair
positively
quite
stagey
something
will
come
of
it
serious
or
comic
i
wonder
which
errington
laughed
but
said
nothing
in
reply
as
their
two
companions
ascended
from
the
cabin
at
that
moment
in
full
attire
for
the
fishing
expedition
followed
by
the
steward
bearing
a
large
basket
of
provisions
for
luncheon
and
all
private
conversation
came
to
an
end
hastening
the
rest
of
their
preparations
within
twenty
minutes
they
were
skimming
across
the
fjord
in
a
long
boat
manned
by
four
sailors
who
rowed
with
a
will
and
sent
the
light
craft
scudding
through
the
water
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
landing
they
climbed
the
dewy
hills
spangled
thick
with
and
late
violets
till
they
reached
a
shady
and
secluded
part
of
the
river
where
surrounded
by
the
songs
of
hundreds
of
birds
they
commenced
their
sport
which
kept
them
well
employed
till
a
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
chapter
iv
thou
art
violently
carried
away
from
grace
there
is
a
devil
haunts
thee
in
the
likeness
of
a
fat
old
man
a
tun
of
man
is
thy
companion
shakespeare
the
reverend
charles
dyceworthy
sat
alone
in
the
small
of
his
house
at
bosekop
finishing
a
late
tea
and
disposing
of
round
after
round
of
hot
buttered
toast
with
that
suave
alacrity
he
always
displayed
in
the
consumption
of
succulent
eatables
he
was
a
largely
made
man
very
much
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
with
accumulations
of
unwholesome
fat
on
every
available
portion
of
his
body
his
round
face
was
cleanly
shaven
and
shiny
as
though
its
flabby
surface
were
frequently
polished
with
some
sort
of
luminous
grease
instead
of
the
customary
soap
his
mouth
was
absurdly
small
and
pursy
for
so
broad
a
countenance
his
nose
seemed
endeavoring
to
retreat
behind
his
puffy
cheeks
as
though
painfully
aware
of
its
own
insignificance
and
he
had
little
sharp
eyes
of
a
dull
mahogany
brown
which
were
utterly
destitute
of
even
the
faintest
attempt
at
any
actual
expression
they
were
more
like
glass
beads
than
eyes
and
glittered
under
their
scanty
fringe
of
lashes
with
a
sort
of
shallow
cunning
which
might
mean
malice
or
no
one
looking
at
them
could
precisely
determine
which
his
hair
was
of
an
indefinite
shade
neither
light
nor
dark
somewhat
of
the
tinge
of
a
dusty
potato
before
it
is
washed
clean
it
was
neatly
brushed
and
parted
in
the
middle
with
mathematical
precision
while
from
the
back
of
his
head
it
was
brought
forward
in
two
projections
one
on
each
side
like
budding
wings
behind
his
ears
it
was
impossible
for
the
most
fastidious
critic
to
find
fault
with
the
reverend
dyceworthy
hands
he
had
beautiful
hands
white
soft
plump
and
his
delicate
filbert
nails
were
trimmed
with
punctilious
care
and
shone
with
a
pink
lustre
that
was
positively
charming
he
was
evidently
an
amiable
man
for
he
smiled
to
himself
over
his
tea
he
had
a
trick
of
smiling
people
said
he
did
it
on
purpose
in
order
to
widen
his
mouth
and
make
it
more
in
to
the
size
of
his
face
such
remarks
however
emanated
only
from
the
spiteful
and
envious
who
could
not
succeed
in
winning
the
social
popularity
that
everywhere
attended
dyceworthy
movements
for
he
was
undoubtedly
popular
no
one
could
deny
that
in
the
small
yorkshire
town
where
he
usually
had
his
abode
he
came
little
short
of
being
adored
by
the
women
of
his
own
particular
sect
who
crowded
to
listen
to
his
fervent
discourses
and
came
away
from
them
on
the
verge
of
hysteria
so
profoundly
moved
were
their
sensitive
souls
by
his
damnatory
doctrines
the
men
were
more
reluctant
in
their
admiration
yet
even
they
were
always
ready
to
admit
that
he
was
an
excellent
fellow
with
his
heart
in
the
right
place
he
had
a
convenient
way
of
getting
ill
at
the
proper
seasons
and
of
requiring
immediate
change
of
air
whereupon
his
grateful
flock
were
ready
and
willing
to
subscribe
the
money
necessary
for
their
beloved
preacher
to
take
repose
and
relaxation
in
any
part
of
the
world
he
chose
this
year
however
they
had
not
been
asked
to
furnish
the
usual
funds
for
travelling
expenses
for
the
resident
minister
of
bosekop
a
frail
gentle
old
man
had
been
seriously
prostrated
during
the
past
winter
with
an
affection
of
the
lungs
which
necessitated
his
going
to
a
different
climate
for
change
and
rest
knowing
dyceworthy
as
a
zealous
member
of
the
lutheran
persuasion
and
moreover
as
one
who
had
in
his
youth
lived
for
some
years
in
christiania
thereby
gaining
a
knowledge
of
the
norwegian
tongue
he
invited
him
to
take
his
place
for
his
enforced
time
of
absence
offering
him
his
house
his
servants
his
and
an
agreeable
pecuniary
in
exchange
for
his
services
proposals
which
the
reverend
charles
eagerly
accepted
though
norway
was
not
exactly
new
to
him
the
region
of
the
alten
fjord
was
and
he
at
once
felt
though
he
knew
not
why
that
the
air
there
would
be
the
very
thing
to
benefit
his
delicate
constitution
besides
it
looked
well
for
at
least
occasion
to
go
away
for
the
summer
without
asking
his
congregation
to
pay
for
his
trip
it
was
generous
on
his
part
almost
noble
the
ladies
of
his
flock
wept
at
his
departure
and
made
him
socks
comforters
slippers
and
other
consoling
gear
of
the
like
description
to
recall
their
sweet
memories
to
his
saintly
mind
during
his
absence
from
their
society
but
truth
to
tell
dyceworthy
gave
little
thought
to
these
fond
and
regretful
fair
ones
he
was
much
too
comfortable
at
bosekop
to
look
back
with
any
emotional
yearning
to
the
ugly
precise
little
provincial
town
he
had
left
behind
him
the
minister
quaint
pretty
house
suited
him
perfectly
the
servants
were
most
punctual
in
their
services
the
minister
phaeton
conveniently
held
his
cumbrous
person
and
the
minister
pony
was
a
quiet
beast
that
trotted
wherever
it
was
guided
and
shied
at
nothing
yes
he
was
thoroughly
comfortable
as
comfortable
as
a
truly
pious
fat
man
deserves
to
be
and
all
the
work
he
had
to
do
was
to
preach
twice
on
sundays
to
a
quiet
primitive
decently
ordered
congregation
who
listened
to
his
words
respectfully
though
without
displaying
any
emotional
rapture
their
stolidity
however
did
not
affect
him
he
preached
to
please
himself
loving
above
all
things
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
never
so
happy
as
when
thundering
fierce
denunciations
against
the
church
of
rome
his
thoughts
seemed
tending
in
that
direction
now
as
he
poured
himself
out
his
third
cup
of
tea
and
smilingly
shook
his
head
over
it
while
he
stirred
the
cream
and
sugar
in
for
he
took
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
small
glittering
object
and
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table
still
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
with
a
patient
yet
reproachful
air
of
superior
wisdom
it
was
a
crucifix
of
and
silver
the
symbol
of
the
christian
faith
but
it
seemed
to
carry
no
sacred
suggestions
to
the
soul
of
dyceworthy
on
the
contrary
he
looked
at
it
with
an
expression
of
meek
ridicule
ridicule
that
bordered
on
contempt
a
roman
he
murmured
placidly
to
himself
between
two
large
bites
of
toast
the
girl
is
a
roman
and
thereby
hopelessly
damned
and
he
smiled
again
more
sweetly
than
before
as
though
the
idea
of
hopeless
damnation
suggested
some
peculiarly
agreeable
reflections
unfolding
his
fine
cambric
handkerchief
he
carefully
wiped
his
fat
white
fingers
free
from
the
greasy
marks
of
the
toast
and
taking
up
the
objectionable
cross
gingerly
as
though
it
were
he
examined
it
closely
on
all
sides
there
were
some
words
engraved
on
the
back
of
it
and
after
some
trouble
dyceworthy
spelt
them
out
they
were
christi
conforta
me
he
shook
his
head
with
a
sort
of
resigned
cheerfulness
hopelessly
damned
he
murmured
again
gently
unless
what
alternative
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
was
not
precisely
apparent
for
his
thoughts
suddenly
turned
in
a
more
frivolous
direction
rising
from
the
now
exhausted
he
drew
out
a
small
and
surveyed
himself
therein
with
a
mild
approval
with
the
extreme
end
of
his
handkerchief
he
tenderly
removed
two
sacrilegious
crumbs
that
presumed
to
linger
in
the
corners
of
his
piously
pursed
mouth
in
the
same
way
he
detached
a
morsel
of
congealed
butter
that
clung
pertinaciously
to
the
end
of
his
bashfully
retreating
nose
this
done
he
again
looked
at
himself
with
increased
satisfaction
and
putting
by
his
rang
the
bell
it
was
answered
at
once
by
a
tall
strongly
built
woman
with
a
colorless
stolid
countenance
that
might
have
been
carved
out
of
wood
for
any
expression
it
had
in
it
ulrika
said
dyceworthy
blandly
you
can
clear
the
table
ulrika
without
answering
began
to
pack
the
together
in
a
methodical
way
without
clattering
so
much
as
a
plate
or
spoon
and
piling
them
compactly
on
a
tray
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
dyceworthy
called
to
her
ulrika
sir
did
you
ever
see
a
thing
like
this
before
and
he
held
up
the
crucifix
to
her
gaze
the
woman
shuddered
and
her
dull
eyes
lit
up
with
a
sudden
terror
it
is
the
witch
charm
she
muttered
thickly
while
her
pale
face
grew
yet
paler
burn
it
sir
burn
it
and
the
power
will
leave
her
dyceworthy
laughed
indulgently
my
good
woman
you
mistake
he
said
suavely
your
zeal
for
the
true
gospel
leads
you
into
error
there
are
thousands
of
misguided
persons
who
worship
such
a
thing
as
this
it
is
often
all
of
our
dear
lord
they
know
sad
very
sad
but
still
though
they
alas
are
not
of
the
elect
and
are
plainly
doomed
to
perdition
they
are
not
precisely
what
are
termed
witches
ulrika
is
replied
the
woman
with
a
sort
of
ferocity
and
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
tell
her
so
to
her
face
and
see
what
would
happen
to
her
then
tut
tut
remarked
dyceworthy
amiably
the
days
of
witchcraft
are
past
you
show
some
little
ignorance
ulrika
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
great
advancement
of
recent
learning
maybe
maybe
and
ulrika
turned
to
go
but
she
muttered
sullenly
as
she
went
there
be
them
that
know
and
could
tell
and
them
that
will
have
her
yet
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
with
a
sharp
clang
and
left
to
himself
dyceworthy
again
smiled
such
a
benignant
fatherly
smile
he
then
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
it
was
past
seven
an
hour
that
elsewhere
would
have
been
considered
evening
but
in
bosekop
at
that
season
it
still
seemed
afternoon
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
and
in
the
minister
front
garden
the
roses
were
all
wide
awake
a
soft
moisture
glittered
on
every
tiny
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
the
penetrating
and
delicious
odor
of
sweet
violets
scented
each
puff
of
wind
and
now
and
then
the
call
of
the
cuckoo
pierced
the
air
with
a
subdued
shrillness
from
his
position
dyceworthy
could
catch
a
glimpse
through
the
trees
of
the
principal
thoroughfare
of
bosekop
a
small
primitive
street
enough
of
little
low
houses
which
though
unpretending
from
without
were
roomy
and
comfortable
within
the
distant
cool
sparkle
of
the
waters
of
the
fjord
the
refreshing
breeze
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
and
the
satisfied
impression
left
on
his
mind
by
recent
tea
and
toast
all
these
things
combined
had
a
soothing
effect
on
dyceworthy
and
with
a
sigh
of
absolute
comfort
he
settled
his
large
person
in
a
deep
easy
chair
and
composed
himself
for
pious
meditation
he
meditated
long
with
eyes
and
open
mouth
while
the
earnestness
of
his
inward
thoughts
was
clearly
demonstrated
now
and
then
by
an
irrepressible
almost
triumphant
from
that
trifling
elevation
of
his
countenance
called
by
courtesy
a
nose
when
his
blissful
reverie
was
suddenly
broken
in
upon
by
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
crunching
slowly
along
the
garden
path
and
starting
up
from
his
chair
he
perceived
four
individuals
clad
in
white
flannel
costumes
and
wearing
light
straw
hats
trimmed
with
fluttering
blue
ribbons
who
were
leisurely
sauntering
up
to
his
door
and
stopping
occasionally
to
admire
the
flowers
on
their
way
dyceworthy
face
reddened
visibly
with
excitement
the
gentlemen
from
the
yacht
he
murmured
to
himself
hastily
settling
his
collar
and
cravat
and
pushing
up
his
cherubic
wings
of
hair
more
prominently
behind
his
ears
i
never
thought
they
would
come
dear
me
sir
philip
errington
himself
too
i
must
have
refreshments
instantly
and
he
hurried
from
the
room
calling
his
orders
to
ulrika
as
he
went
and
before
the
visitors
had
time
to
ring
he
had
thrown
open
the
door
to
them
himself
and
stood
smiling
urbanely
on
the
threshold
welcoming
them
with
enthusiasm
and
assuring
sir
philip
especially
how
much
honored
he
felt
by
his
thus
visiting
familiarly
and
unannounced
his
humble
dwelling
errington
waved
his
many
compliments
aside
and
allowed
himself
and
his
friends
to
be
marshalled
into
the
best
parlor
the
of
the
house
a
pretty
little
apartment
whose
window
looked
out
upon
a
tangled
yet
graceful
wilderness
of
flowers
nice
cosy
place
this
remarked
lorimer
as
he
seated
himself
negligently
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
you
must
be
pretty
comfortable
here
their
perspiring
and
affable
host
rubbed
his
soft
white
hands
together
gently
i
thank
heaven
it
suits
my
simple
needs
he
answered
meekly
luxuries
do
not
become
a
poor
servant
of
god
ah
then
you
are
different
to
many
others
who
profess
to
serve
the
same
master
said
duprèz
with
a
that
had
the
devil
own
mockery
in
it
le
bon
is
very
impartial
some
serve
him
by
constant
others
by
constant
it
is
all
one
to
him
apparently
how
do
you
know
which
among
his
servants
he
likes
best
the
fat
or
the
lean
sandy
macfarlane
though
slightly
a
bigot
for
his
own
form
of
doctrine
broke
into
a
low
chuckle
of
irrepressible
laughter
at
duprèz
levity
but
dyceworthy
flabby
face
betokened
the
utmost
horror
sir
he
said
gravely
there
are
subjects
concerning
which
it
is
not
seemly
to
speak
without
due
reverence
he
knoweth
his
own
elect
he
hath
chosen
them
out
from
the
beginning
he
summoned
forth
from
the
million
the
glorious
apostle
of
reform
martin
luther
bon
gaillard
laughed
duprèz
tempted
by
a
pretty
nun
what
man
could
resist
myself
i
would
try
to
upset
all
the
creeds
of
this
world
if
i
saw
a
pretty
nun
worth
my
trouble
yes
truly
a
pity
though
that
the
poor
luther
died
of
his
exit
from
life
so
undignified
shut
up
duprèz
said
errington
severely
you
displease
dyceworthy
by
your
fooling
oh
pray
do
not
mention
it
sir
philip
murmured
the
reverend
gentleman
with
a
mild
patience
we
must
accustom
ourselves
to
hear
with
forbearance
the
opinions
of
all
men
howsoever
contradictory
otherwise
our
vocation
is
of
no
avail
yet
is
it
sorely
grievous
to
me
to
consider
that
there
should
be
any
person
or
persons
existent
who
lack
the
necessary
faith
requisite
for
the
performance
of
god
promises
ye
must
understand
dyceworthy
said
macfarlane
in
his
slow
deliberate
manner
that
ye
have
before
ye
a
young
frenchman
who
doesna
believe
in
onything
except
himsel
and
even
as
to
whether
he
himsel
is
a
mon
or
a
myth
he
has
his
doots
vera
grave
doots
duprèz
nodded
delightedly
that
is
so
he
exclaimed
our
dear
sandy
puts
it
so
charmingly
to
be
a
myth
seems
original
to
be
a
mere
man
quite
ordinary
i
believe
it
is
possible
to
find
some
good
scientific
professor
who
would
prove
me
to
be
a
myth
the
moving
shadow
of
a
dream
imagine
how
perfectly
poetical
you
talk
too
much
to
be
a
dream
my
boy
laughed
errington
and
turning
to
dyceworthy
he
added
i
afraid
you
must
think
us
a
shocking
set
we
are
really
none
of
us
very
religious
i
fear
though
and
he
tried
to
look
serious
if
it
had
not
been
for
lorimer
we
should
have
come
to
church
last
sunday
lorimer
was
unfortunately
rather
indisposed
drawled
that
gentleman
turning
from
the
little
window
where
he
had
been
gathering
a
rose
for
his
i
was
knocked
up
had
fits
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
took
these
three
fellows
all
their
time
on
sunday
to
hold
me
down
dear
me
and
dyceworthy
was
about
to
make
further
inquiries
concerning
lorimer
present
state
of
health
when
the
door
opened
and
ulrika
entered
bearing
a
large
tray
laden
with
wine
and
other
refreshments
as
she
set
it
down
she
gave
a
keen
covert
glance
round
the
room
as
though
rapidly
taking
note
of
the
appearance
and
faces
of
all
the
young
men
then
with
a
sort
of
stiff
curtsey
she
departed
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
not
however
without
leaving
a
disagreeable
impression
on
errington
mind
rather
a
stern
phyllis
that
of
yours
he
remarked
watching
his
host
who
was
carefully
drawing
the
cork
from
one
of
the
bottles
of
wine
dyceworthy
smiled
oh
no
no
not
stern
at
all
he
answered
sweetly
on
the
contrary
most
affable
and
her
only
fault
is
that
she
is
a
little
zealous
for
the
purity
of
the
faith
and
she
has
suffered
much
but
she
is
an
excellent
woman
really
excellent
sir
philip
will
you
try
this
lacrima
christi
lacrima
christi
exclaimed
duprèz
you
do
not
surely
get
that
in
norway
it
seems
strange
certainly
replied
dyceworthy
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
italian
or
papist
wines
are
often
used
here
the
minister
whose
place
i
humbly
endeavor
to
fill
has
his
cellar
stocked
with
them
the
matter
is
easy
of
comprehension
when
once
explained
the
benighted
inhabitants
of
italy
a
land
lost
in
the
darkness
of
error
still
persist
in
their
fasts
notwithstanding
the
evident
folly
of
their
ways
and
the
norwegian
sailors
provide
them
with
large
quantities
of
fish
for
their
idolatrous
customs
bringing
back
their
wines
in
exchange
a
very
good
idea
said
lorimer
sipping
the
lacrima
with
evident
approval
phil
i
doubt
if
your
brands
on
board
the
are
better
than
this
hardly
so
good
replied
errington
with
some
surprise
as
he
tasted
the
wine
and
noted
its
delicious
flavor
the
minister
must
be
a
fine
are
there
many
other
families
about
here
dyceworthy
who
know
how
to
choose
their
wines
so
well
dyceworthy
smiled
with
a
dubious
air
there
is
one
other
household
that
in
the
matter
of
choice
liquids
is
almost
profanely
particular
he
said
but
they
are
people
who
are
ejected
with
good
reason
from
respectable
society
and
it
behooves
me
not
to
speak
of
their
names
oh
indeed
said
errington
while
a
sudden
and
inexplicable
thrill
of
indignation
fired
his
blood
and
sent
it
in
a
wave
of
color
up
to
his
forehead
may
i
ask
but
he
was
interrupted
by
lorimer
who
nudging
him
slyly
on
one
side
muttered
keep
cool
old
fellow
you
ca
tell
whether
he
talking
about
the
güldmar
folk
be
quiet
you
do
want
every
one
to
know
your
little
game
thus
adjured
philip
swallowed
a
large
gulp
of
wine
to
keep
down
his
feelings
and
strove
to
appear
interested
in
the
habits
and
caprices
of
bees
a
subject
into
which
dyceworthy
had
just
inveigled
duprèz
and
macfarlane
come
and
see
my
bees
said
the
reverend
charles
almost
pathetically
they
are
emblems
of
and
patient
industry
storing
up
honey
for
others
to
partake
thereof
they
wudna
store
it
up
at
a
perhaps
if
they
knew
that
observed
sandy
significantly
dyceworthy
positively
shone
all
over
with
beneficence
they
store
it
up
sir
yes
they
would
even
if
they
knew
it
is
god
will
that
they
should
store
it
up
it
is
god
will
that
they
should
show
an
example
of
unselfishness
that
they
should
flit
from
flower
to
flower
sucking
therefrom
the
sweetness
to
impart
into
strange
palates
unlike
their
own
it
is
a
beautiful
lesson
it
teaches
us
who
are
the
ministers
of
the
lord
to
likewise
suck
the
sweetness
from
the
flowers
of
the
living
gospel
and
impart
it
gladly
to
the
unbelievers
who
shall
find
it
sweeter
than
the
sweetest
honey
and
he
shook
his
head
piously
several
times
while
the
pores
of
his
fat
visage
exuded
holy
oil
duprèz
sniggered
secretly
macfarlane
looked
preternaturally
solemn
come
repeated
the
reverend
gentleman
with
an
inviting
smile
come
and
see
my
bees
also
my
strawberries
i
shall
be
delighted
to
send
a
basket
of
the
fruit
to
the
yacht
if
sir
philip
will
permit
me
errington
expressed
his
thanks
with
due
courtesy
and
hastened
to
seize
the
opportunity
that
presented
itself
for
breaking
away
from
the
party
if
you
will
excuse
us
for
twenty
minutes
or
so
dyceworthy
he
said
lorimer
and
i
want
to
consult
a
fellow
here
in
bosekop
about
some
new
fishing
tackle
we
sha
be
gone
long
mac
you
and
duprèz
wait
for
us
here
do
commit
too
many
depredations
on
strawberries
the
reason
for
their
departure
was
so
simply
and
naturally
given
that
it
was
accepted
without
any
opposing
remarks
duprèz
was
delighted
to
have
the
chance
of
amusing
himself
by
harassing
the
reverend
charles
with
open
professions
of
utter
atheism
and
macfarlane
who
loved
an
argument
more
than
he
loved
whiskey
looked
forward
to
a
sharp
discussion
presently
concerning
the
superiority
of
john
knox
morally
and
physically
over
martin
luther
so
that
when
the
others
went
their
way
their
departure
excited
no
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
their
friends
and
most
unsuspecting
of
all
was
the
placid
dyceworthy
who
had
he
imagined
for
an
instant
the
direction
which
they
were
going
would
certainly
not
have
discoursed
on
the
pleasures
of
with
the
calmness
and
placid
conviction
that
always
distinguished
him
when
holding
forth
on
any
subject
that
was
attractive
to
his
mind
leading
the
way
through
his
dewy
garden
and
conversing
amicably
as
he
went
he
escorted
macfarlane
and
duprèz
to
what
he
called
with
a
gentle
humor
his
while
errington
and
lorimer
returned
to
the
shore
of
the
fjord
where
they
had
left
their
boat
moored
to
a
small
clumsily
constructed
pier
and
entering
it
they
set
themselves
to
the
oars
and
pulled
away
together
with
the
long
steady
sweeping
stroke
rendered
famous
by
the
exploits
of
the
oxford
and
cambridge
men
after
some
twenty
minutes
rowing
lorimer
looked
up
and
spoke
as
he
drew
his
blade
swiftly
through
the
bright
green
water
i
feel
as
though
i
were
aiding
and
abetting
you
in
some
crime
phil
you
know
my
first
impression
of
this
business
remains
the
same
you
had
much
better
leave
it
alone
why
asked
errington
coolly
well
my
life
i
do
know
why
except
that
from
long
experience
i
have
proved
that
it
always
dangerous
and
troublesome
to
run
after
a
woman
leave
her
to
run
after
you
she
do
it
fast
enough
wait
till
you
see
her
besides
i
not
running
after
any
woman
averred
philip
with
some
heat
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
she
not
a
woman
she
a
you
are
rowing
not
running
after
a
is
that
correct
i
say
do
drive
through
the
water
like
that
you
pull
the
boat
round
errington
slackened
his
speed
and
laughed
it
only
curiosity
he
said
lifting
his
hat
and
pushing
back
the
clustering
curls
from
his
brow
i
bet
you
that
sleek
dyceworthy
fellow
meant
the
old
and
his
daughter
when
he
spoke
of
persons
who
were
from
the

presuming
to
be
particular
what
an
absurd
idea
my
good
fellow
do
pretend
to
be
so
deplorably
ignorant
surely
you
know
that
a
trumpery
village
or
a
town
is
much
more
choice
and
exclusive
in
its
than
a
great
city
i
would
live
in
a
small
place
for
the
world
every
inhabitant
would
know
the
cut
of
my
clothes
by
heart
and
the
number
of
buttons
on
my
waistcoat
the
grocer
would
copy
the
pattern
of
my
trousers
the
butcher
would
carry
a
cane
like
mine
it
would
be
simply
insufferable

you

you
are
going
for
it
seems
to
me
we
bound
straight
for
a
smash
on
that
rock
where
there
is
certainly
no
errington
stopped
pulling
and
standing
up
in
the
boat
began
to
examine
the
surroundings
with
keen
interest
they
were
close
to
the
great
crag
shaped
like
a
giant
helmet
as
valdemar
svensen
had
said
it
rose
sheer
out
of
the
water
and
its
sides
were
almost
perpendicular
some
beautiful
sea
anemones
clung
to
it
in
a
cluster
on
one
projection
and
the
running
ripple
of
the
small
waves
broke
on
its
jagged
corners
with
a
musical
splash
and
sparkle
of
white
foam
below
them
in
the
emerald
mirror
of
the
fjord
it
was
so
clear
that
they
could
see
the
fine
white
sand
lying
at
the
bottom
sprinkled
thick
with
shells
and
lithe
moving
creatures
of
all
shapes
while
every
now
and
then
there
streamed
past
them
brilliantly
tinted
specimens
of
the
medusae
with
their
long
feelers
or
tendrils
looking
like
torn
skins
of
crimson
and
azure
floss
silk
the
place
was
very
silent
only
the
circled
round
and
round
the
summit
of
the
great
rock
some
of
them
occasionally
swooping
down
on
the
unwary
fishes
their
keen
eyes
perceived
in
the
waters
beneath
then
up
again
they
soared
swaying
their
graceful
wings
and
uttering
at
intervals
that
peculiar
wild
cry
that
in
solitary
haunts
sounds
so
intensely
mournful
errington
gazed
about
him
in
doubt
for
some
minutes
then
suddenly
his
face
brightened
he
sat
down
again
in
the
boat
and
resumed
his
oar
row
quietly
george
he
said
in
a
subdued
tone
quietly
round
to
the
left
the
oars
dipped
noiselessly
and
the
boat
shot
forward
then
swerved
sharply
round
in
the
direction
and
there
before
them
lay
a
small
sandy
creek
white
and
shining
as
though
sprinkled
with
powdered
silver
from
this
a
small
but
wooden
pier
ran
out
into
the
sea
it
was
carved
all
over
with
fantastic
figures
and
in
it
at
equal
distances
were
fastened
iron
rings
such
as
are
used
for
the
safe
mooring
of
boats
one
boat
was
there
already
and
errington
recognized
it
with
delight
it
was
that
in
which
he
had
seen
the
mysterious
maiden
disappear
high
and
dry
on
the
sand
out
of
reach
of
the
tides
was
a
neat
its
name
was
painted
round
the
stern
as
the
two
friends
ran
their
boat
on
shore
and
fastened
it
to
the
furthest
ring
of
the
convenient
pier
they
caught
the
distant
sound
of
the
plaintiff
of
turtle
doves

it
this
time
old
boy
said
lorimer
speaking
in
a
whisper
though
he
knew
not
why
this
is
the
old
own
private

here

emphatically
assented
and
treading
softly
like
the
trespassers
they
felt
themselves
to
be
they
climbed
the
ascending
narrow
way
that
guided
them
up
from
the
seashore
round
through
a
close
thicket
of
pines
where
their
footsteps
fell
noiselessly
on
a
thick
carpet
of
velvety
green
moss
dotted
prettily
here
and
there
with
the
red
gleam
of
ripening
wild
strawberries
everything
was
intensely
still
and
as
yet
there
seemed
no
sign
of
human
habitation
suddenly
a
low
whirring
sound
broke
upon
their
ears
and
errington
who
was
a
little
in
advance
of
his
companion
paused
abruptly
with
a
smothered
exclamation
and
drew
back
on
catching
lorimer
by
the
arm
by
jove
he
whispered
excitedly
we
come
right
up
to
the
very
windows
of
the
house
look
lorimer
obeyed
and
for
once
the
light
jest
died
upon
his
tips
surprise
and
admiration
held
him
absolutely
silent

before
them
close
enough
for
their
outstretched
hands
to
have
touched
it
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
framed
picture
exquisitely
painted
a
picture
perfect
in
outline
matchless
in
color
faultless
in
detail
but
which
was
in
reality
nothing
but
a
large
latticed
window
thrown
wide
open
to
admit
the
air
they
could
now
see
distinctly
through
the
shadows
cast
by
the
stately
pines
a
long
low
rambling
house
built
roughly
but
strongly
of
wooden
rafters
all
overgrown
with
green
and
blossoming
creepers
but
they
scarcely
glanced
at
the
actual
building
so
strongly
was
their
attention
riveted
on
the
one
window
before
them
it
was
surrounded
by
an
unusually
broad
framework
curiously
and
elaborately
carved
and
black
as
polished
ebony
flowers
grew
all
about
it
sweet
peas
mignonette
and
large
purple
pansies
while
red
and
white
climbing
roses
rioted
in
untrained
profusion
over
its
wide
sill
above
it
was
a
quaintly
built
dovecote
where
some
of
the
strutting
inhabitants
were
perched
swelling
out
their
snowy
breasts
and
discoursing
of
their
domestic
trials
in
notes
of
dulcet
melancholy
while
lower
down
three
or
four
nestled
on
the
roof
in
a
patch
of
sunlight
spreading
up
their
pinions
like
miniature
sails
to
catch
the
warmth
and
lustre
within
the
deep
shadowy
embrasure
like
a
jewel
placed
on
dark
velvet
was
seated
a
girl
spinning
no
other
than
the
mysterious
maiden
of
the
shell
cavern
she
was
attired
in
a
plain
straight
gown
of
some
soft
white
woolen
stuff
cut
squarely
at
her
throat
her
round
graceful
arms
were
partially
bare
and
as
the
wheel
turned
swiftly
and
her
slender
hands
busied
themselves
with
the
flax
she
smiled
as
though
some
pleasing
thought
had
touched
her
mind
her
smile
had
the
effect
of
sudden
sunshine
in
the
dark
room
where
she
sat
and
span
it
was
radiant
and
mirthful
as
the
smile
of
a
happy
child
yet
her
dark
blue
eyes
remained
pensive
and
earnest
and
the
smile
soon
faded
leaving
her
fair
face
absorbed
and
almost
dreamy
the
of
the
wheel
grew
less
and
less
rapid
it
slackened
it
stopped
altogether
and
as
though
startled
by
some
unexpected
sound
the
girl
paused
and
listened
pushing
away
the
clustering
masses
of
her
rich
hair
from
her
brow
then
rising
slowly
from
her
seat
she
advanced
to
the
window
put
aside
the
roses
with
one
hand
and
looked
out
thus
forming
another
picture
as
beautiful
if
not
more
beautiful
than
the
first
lorimer
drew
his
breath
hard
i
say
old
fellow
he
whispered
but
errington
pressed
his
arm
with
firmness
as
a
warning
to
him
to
be
silent
while
they
both
stepped
farther
back
into
the
dusky
gloom
of
the
pine
boughs
the
girl
meanwhile
stood
motionless
in
a
attitude
and
seeing
her
there
some
of
the
doves
on
the
roof
flew
down
and
strutted
on
the
ground
before
her
proudly
as
though
desirous
of
attracting
her
attention
one
of
them
boldly
perched
on
the
she
glanced
at
the
bird
musingly
and
softly
stroked
its
opaline
wings
and
shining
head
without
terrifying
it
it
seemed
delighted
to
be
noticed
and
almost
lay
down
under
her
hand
in
order
to
be
more
conveniently
caressed
still
gently
smoothing
its
feathers
she
leaned
further
out
among
the
clambering
wealth
of
blossoms
and
called
in
a
low
penetrating
tone
father
father
is
that
you
there
was
no
answer
and
after
waited
a
minute
or
two
she
moved
and
resumed
her
former
seat
the
stray
doves
flew
back
to
their
customary
promenade
on
the
roof
and
the
drowsy
of
the
murmured
again
its
monotonous
hum
upon
the
air
come
on
phil
whispered
lorimer
determined
not
to
be
checked
this
time
i
feel
perfectly
wretched
it
mean
of
us
to
be
skulking
about
here
as
if
we
were
a
couple
of
low
thieves
waiting
to
trap
some
of
those
birds
for
a
come
away
you
seen
her
enough
errington
did
not
move
holding
back
a
branch
of
pine
he
watched
the
movements
of
the
girl
at
her
wheel
with
absorbed
fascination
suddenly
her
sweet
lips
parted
and
she
sang
a
weird
wild
melody
that
seemed
like
a
running
torrent
to
have
fallen
from
the
crests
of
the
mountains
bringing
with
it
echoes
from
the
furthest
summits
mingled
with
soft
wailings
of
a
mournful
wind
her
voice
was
pure
as
the
ring
of
fine
crystal
deep
liquid
and
tender
with
a
restrained
passion
in
it
that
stirred
errington
heart
and
filled
it
with
a
strange
unrest
and
feverish
yearning
emotions
which
were
new
to
him
and
which
while
he
realized
their
existence
moved
him
to
a
sort
of
ashamed
impatience
he
would
have
willingly
left
his
post
of
observation
now
if
only
for
the
sake
of
shaking
off
his
unwonted
sensations
and
he
took
a
step
or
two
backwards
for
that
purpose
when
lorimer
in
his
turn
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
heaven
sake
let
us
hear
the
song
through
he
said
in
subdued
tones
what
a
voice
a
positive
golden
flute
his
rapt
face
betokened
his
enjoyment
and
errington
nothing
loth
still
lingered
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
slim
figure
framed
in
the
dark
old
window
the
figure
that
swayed
softly
with
the
motion
of
the
wheel
and
the
rhythm
of
the
song
while
flickering
sunbeams
sparkled
now
and
then
on
the
maiden
dusky
gold
hair
or
touched
up
a
warmer
tint
on
her
tenderly
flushed
cheeks
and
fair
neck
more
snowy
than
the
gown
she
wore
music
poured
from
her
lips
as
from
the
throat
of
a
nightingale
the
words
she
sang
were
norwegian
and
her
listeners
understood
nothing
of
them
but
the
melody
the
pathetic
appealing
melody
as
all
true
melody
must
be
touched
the
very
core
of
their
hearts
and
entangled
them
in
a
web
of
delicious
reveries
talk
of
ary
scheffer
gretchen
murmured
lorimer
with
a
sigh
what
a
miserable
pasty
young
person
she
is
beside
that
magnificent
unconscious
beauty
i
give
in
phil
i
admit
your
taste
i
willing
to
swear
that
she
a
if
you
like
her
voice
has
convinced
me
of
that
at
that
instant
the
song
ceased
errington
turned
and
regarded
him
steadfastly
are
hit
george
he
said
softly
with
a
forced
smile
lorimer
face
flushed
but
he
met
his
friend
eyes
frankly
i
am
no
poacher
old
fellow
he
answered
in
the
same
quiet
accents
i
think
you
know
that
if
that
girl
mind
is
as
lovely
as
her
face
i
say
go
in
and
win
sir
philip
smiled
his
brow
cleared
and
an
expression
of
relief
settled
there
the
look
of
gladness
was
unconscious
but
lorimer
saw
it
at
once
and
noted
it
nonsense
he
said
in
a
mirthful
undertone
how
can
i
go
in
and
win
as
you
say
what
am
i
to
do
i
ca
go
up
to
that
window
and
speak
to
her
she
might
take
me
for
a
thief
you
look
like
a
thief
replied
lorimer
surveying
his
athletic
figure
clad
in
its
loose
but
yachting
suit
of
white
flannel
ornamented
with
silver
anchor
buttons
and
taking
a
comprehensive
glance
from
the
easy
pose
of
the
fine
head
and
handsome
face
down
to
the
trim
foot
with
the
high
and
instep
very
much
like
a
thief
i
wonder
i
have
noticed
it
before
any
london
policeman
would
arrest
you
on
the
mere
fact
of
your
suspicious
appearance
errington
laughed
well
my
boy
whatever
my
looks
may
testify
i
am
at
this
moment
an
undoubted
trespasser
on
private
property
and
so
are
you
for
that
matter
what
shall
we
do
find
the
front
door
and
ring
the
bell
suggested
george
promptly
say
we
are
benighted
travellers
and
have
lost
our
way
the
can
but
flay
us
the
operation
i
believe
is
painful
but
it
can
not
last
long
george
you
are
incorrigible
suppose
we
go
back
and
try
the
other
side
of
this
that
might
lead
us
to
the
front
of
the
house
i
do
see
why
we
should
walk
coolly
past
that
window
said
lorimer
if
any
observation
is
made
by
the
fair
yonder
we
can
boldly
say
we
have
come
to
see
the
unconsciously
they
had
both
raised
their
voices
a
little
during
the
latter
part
of
their
hasty
dialogue
and
at
the
instant
when
lorimer
uttered
the
last
words
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
on
each
of
their
shoulders
a
hand
that
turned
them
round
forcibly
away
from
the
window
they
had
been
gazing
at
and
a
deep
resonant
voice
addressed
them
the
truly
young
men
you
need
seek
no
further
i
am
olaf
güldmar
had
he
said
i
am
an
emperor
he
could
not
have
spoken
with
more
pride
errington
and
his
friend
were
for
a
moment
speechless
partly
from
displeasure
at
the
summary
manner
in
which
they
had
been
seized
and
twisted
round
like
young
uprooted
saplings
and
partly
from
surprise
and
involuntary
admiration
for
the
personage
who
had
treated
them
with
such
scant
courtesy
they
saw
before
them
a
man
somewhat
above
the
middle
height
who
might
have
served
an
aspiring
sculptor
as
a
perfect
model
for
a
chieftain
of
old
gaul
or
a
dauntless
viking
his
frame
was
firmly
and
powerfully
built
and
seemed
to
be
exceptionally
strong
and
muscular
yet
an
air
of
almost
courtly
grace
pervaded
his
movements
making
each
attitude
he
assumed
more
or
less
picturesque
he
was
and
his
face
was
full
and
healthily
colored
while
his
head
was
truly
magnificent
and
shapely
it
indicated
power
will
and
wisdom
and
was
furthermore
adorned
by
a
rough
thick
mass
of
hair
that
shone
in
the
sunlight
like
spun
silver
his
beard
was
short
and
curly
trimmed
after
the
fashion
of
the
warriors
of
old
rome
and
from
under
his
fierce
fuzzy
grey
eyebrows
a
pair
of
sentinel
eyes
that
were
keen
clear
and
bold
as
an
eagle
looked
out
with
a
watchful
steadiness
steadiness
that
like
the
sharp
edge
of
a
diamond
seemed
warranted
to
cut
through
the
brittle
glass
of
a
lie
judging
by
his
outward
appearance
his
age
might
have
been
guessed
at
as
between
and
sixty
but
he
was
in
truth
and
more
strong
active
and
daring
than
many
another
man
whose
years
are
not
counted
past
the
thirties
he
was
curiously
attired
after
something
of
the
fashion
of
the
highlander
and
something
yet
more
of
the
ancient
greek
in
a
tunic
vest
and
loose
jacket
all
made
of
reindeer
skin
thickly
embroidered
with
curious
designs
worked
in
coarse
thread
and
colored
beads
while
thrown
carelessly
over
his
shoulders
and
knotted
at
his
waist
was
a
broad
scarf
of
white
woollen
stuff
or
very
and
warm
in
his
belt
he
carried
a
formidable
and
as
he
faced
the
two
intruders
on
his
ground
he
rested
one
hand
lightly
yet
suggestively
on
a
weighty
staff
of
pine
which
was
notched
all
over
with
quaint
letters
and
figures
and
terminated
in
a
curved
handle
at
the
top
he
waited
for
the
young
men
to
speak
and
finding
they
remained
silent
he
glanced
at
them
half
angrily
and
again
repeated
his
words
i
am
the
olaf
güldmar
speak
your
business
and
take
your
departure
my
time
is
brief
lorimer
looked
up
with
his
usual
nonchalance
a
faint
smile
playing
about
his
lips
he
saw
at
once
that
the
old
farmer
was
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
and
he
raised
his
cap
with
a
ready
grace
as
he
spoke
fact
is
he
said
frankly
we
no
business
here
at
all
not
the
least
in
the
world
we
are
perfectly
aware
of
it
we
are
trespassers
and
we
know
it
pray
do
be
hard
on
us
mr
güldmar
the
glanced
him
over
with
a
quick
lightening
of
the
eyes
and
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
in
the
depths
of
his
curly
beard
he
turned
to
errington
is
this
true
you
came
here
on
purpose
knowing
the
ground
was
private
property
errington
in
his
turn
lifted
his
cap
from
his
clustering
brown
curls
with
that
serene
and
stately
court
manner
which
was
to
him
second
nature
we
did
he
confessed
quietly
following
lorimer
cue
and
seeing
also
that
it
was
best
to
be
straightforward
we
heard
you
spoken
of
in
bosekop
and
we
came
to
see
if
you
would
permit
us
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
the
old
man
struck
his
violently
into
the
ground
and
his
face
flushed
wrathfully
bosekop
he
exclaimed
talk
to
me
of
a
wasp
nest
bosekop
you
shall
hear
of
me
there
enough
to
satisfy
your
appetite
for
news
bosekop
in
the
days
when
my
race
ruled
the
land
such
people
as
they
that
dwell
there
would
have
been
put
to
sharpen
my
sword
on
the
grindstone
or
to
wait
hungry
and
humble
for
the
refuse
of
the
food
left
from
my
table
he
spoke
with
extraordinary
heat
and
passion
it
was
evidently
necessary
to
soothe
him
lorimer
took
a
covert
glance
backward
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
lattice
window
and
saw
that
the
white
figure
at
the
had
disappeared
my
dear
güldmar
he
then
said
with
polite
fervor
i
assure
you
i
think
the
bosekop
folk
by
no
means
deserve
to
sharpen
your
sword
on
the
grindstone
or
to
enjoy
the
remains
of
your
dinner
myself
i
despise
them
my
friend
here
sir
philip
errington
despises
them
do
you
phil
errington
nodded
demurely
what
my
friend
said
just
now
is
perfectly
true
continued
lorimer
we
desire
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
it
will
charm
and
delight
us
above
all
things
and
his
face
beamed
with
a
candid
winning
boyish
smile
which
was
very
captivating
in
its
own
way
and
which
certainly
had
its
effect
on
the
old
for
his
tone
softened
though
he
said
gravely
my
acquaintance
young
men
is
never
sought
by
any
those
who
are
wise
keep
away
from
me
i
love
not
strangers
it
is
best
you
should
know
it
i
freely
pardon
your
trespass
take
your
leave
and
go
in
peace
the
two
friends
exchanged
disconsolate
looks
there
really
seemed
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
this
unpleasing
command
errington
made
one
more
venture
may
i
hope
güldmar
he
said
with
persuasive
courtesy
that
you
will
break
through
your
apparent
rule
of
seclusion
for
once
and
visit
me
on
board
my
yacht
you
have
no
doubt
seen
her
the
she
lies
at
anchor
in
the
fjord
the
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
i
have
seen
her
a
fair
toy
vessel
to
amuse
an
idle
young
man
leisure
you
are
he
that
in
that
fool
hole
of
a
bosekop
is
known
as
the
englishman
an
idle
trifler
with
time
an
aimless
wanderer
from
those
dull
shores
where
they
eat
gold
till
they
die
of
surfeit
i
have
heard
of
you
a
mushroom
knight
a
fungus
of
nobility
an
ephemeral
growth
on
a
grand
decaying
old
tree
whose
roots
lie
buried
in
the
annals
of
a
far
forgotten
past
the
rich
deep
voice
of
the
old
man
quivered
as
he
spoke
and
a
shadow
of
melancholy
flitted
across
his
brow
errington
listened
with
unruffled
patience
he
heard
himself
his
pleasures
his
wealth
his
rank
thus
made
light
of
without
the
least
offense
he
met
the
steady
gaze
of
the
quietly
and
slightly
bent
his
head
as
though
in
deference
to
his
remarks
you
are
quite
right
he
said
simply
we
modern
men
are
but
pigmies
compared
with
the
giants
of
old
time
royal
blood
itself
is
tainted
nowadays
but
for
myself
i
attach
no
importance
to
the
mere
appurtenances
of
life
the
baggage
that
accompanies
one
on
that
brief
journey
life
itself
is
quite
enough
for
me
and
for
me
too
averred
lorimer
delighted
that
his
friend
had
taken
the
old
farmer
scornful
observations
so
but
do
you
know
güldmar
you
are
making
life
unpleasant
for
us
just
now
by
turning
us
out
the
conversation
is
becoming
interesting
why
not
prolong
it
we
have
no
friends
in
bosekop
and
we
are
to
anchor
here
for
some
days
surely
you
will
allow
us
to
come
and
see
you
again
olaf
güldmar
was
silent
he
advanced
a
step
nearer
and
studied
them
both
with
such
earnest
and
searching
scrutiny
that
as
they
remembered
the
real
attraction
that
had
drawn
them
thither
the
conscious
blood
mounted
to
their
faces
flushing
errington
forehead
to
the
very
roots
of
his
curly
brown
hair
still
the
old
man
gazed
as
though
he
sought
to
read
their
very
souls
he
muttered
something
to
himself
in
norwegian
and
finally
to
their
utter
astonishment
he
drew
his
from
its
sheath
and
with
a
rapid
wild
gesture
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
placed
his
foot
upon
it
be
it
so
he
said
briefly
i
cover
the
blade
you
are
men
like
men
you
speak
truth
as
such
i
receive
you
had
you
told
me
a
lie
concerning
your
coming
here
had
you
made
pretense
of
having
lost
your
way
or
other
such
shifty
evasion
your
path
would
never
have
again
crossed
mine
as
it
is
welcome
and
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
sort
of
royal
dignity
still
resting
one
foot
on
the
fallen
weapon
the
young
men
struck
by
his
action
and
gratified
by
his
change
of
manner
and
the
genial
expression
that
now
softened
his
rugged
features
were
quick
to
respond
to
his
friendly
greeting
and
the
picking
up
and
his
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
at
all
out
of
the
common
motioned
them
towards
the
very
window
on
which
their
eyes
had
been
so
long
and
so
ardently
fixed
come
he
said
you
must
drain
a
cup
of
wine
with
me
before
you
leave
your
unguided
footsteps
led
you
by
the
wrong
path
i
saw
your
boat
moored
to
my
pier
and
wondered
who
had
been
venturesome
enough
to
trample
through
my
woodland
i
might
have
guessed
that
only
a
couple
of
idle
boys
like
yourselves
knowing
no
better
would
have
pushed
their
way
to
a
spot
that
all
worthy
dwellers
in
bosekop
and
all
true
followers
of
the
lutheran
devilry
avoid
as
though
the
plague
were
settled
in
it
and
the
old
man
laughed
a
splendid
mellow
laugh
with
the
ring
of
true
jollity
in
it
a
laugh
that
was
infectious
for
errington
and
lorimer
joined
in
it
heartily
without
precisely
knowing
why
lorimer
however
thought
it
seemly
to
protest
against
the
appellation
idle
boys
what
do
you
take
us
for
sir
he
said
with
lazy
i
carry
upon
my
shoulders
the
sorrowful
burden
of
years
philip
there
is
painfully
conscious
of
being
thirty
may
we
not
therefore
dispute
the
word
as
being
derogatory
to
our
dignity
you
called
us
a
while
ago
remember
that
olaf
güldmar
laughed
again
his
suspicious
gravity
had
entirely
disappeared
leaving
his
face
a
beaming
mirror
of
beneficence
and
so
you
men
he
said
cheerily
men
in
the
bud
like
leaves
on
a
tree
but
you
seem
boys
to
a
tough
old
stump
of
humanity
such
as
i
am
that
is
my
way
my
child
thelma
though
they
tell
me
she
is
a
woman
grown
is
always
a
babe
to
me
is
one
of
the
many
privileges
of
the
old
to
see
the
world
about
them
always
young
and
full
of
children
and
he
led
the
way
past
the
lattice
where
they
could
dimly
perceive
the
standing
alone
as
though
thinking
deeply
of
the
fair
hands
that
had
lately
left
it
idle
and
so
round
to
the
actual
front
of
the
house
which
was
exceedingly
picturesque
and
literally
overgrown
with
roses
from
ground
to
roof
the
entrance
door
stood
open
it
was
surrounded
by
a
wide
deep
porch
richly
carved
and
grotesquely
ornamented
having
two
comfortable
seats
within
it
one
on
each
side
through
this
they
went
involuntarily
brushing
down
as
they
passed
a
shower
of
pink
and
white
and
stepped
into
a
wide
passage
where
upon
walls
of
dark
polished
pine
hung
a
large
collection
of
curiously
shaped
weapons
all
of
primitive
manufacture
such
as
stone
darts
and
rough
axes
together
with
bows
and
arrows
and
swords
huge
as
the
fabled
weapon
of
william
wallace
opening
a
door
to
the
right
the
stood
courteously
aside
and
bade
them
enter
and
they
found
themselves
in
the
very
apartment
where
they
had
seen
the
maiden
spinning
sit
down
sit
down
said
their
host
hospitably
we
will
have
wine
directly
and
thelma
shall
come
hither
thelma
thelma
where
is
the
child
she
wanders
hither
and
thither
like
a
mountain
sprite
wait
here
my
lads
i
shall
return
directly
and
he
strode
away
leaving
errington
and
lorimer
delighted
at
the
success
of
their
plans
yet
somewhat
abashed
too
there
was
a
peace
and
gentle
simplicity
about
the
little
room
in
which
they
were
that
touched
the
chivalrous
sentiment
in
their
natures
and
kept
them
silent
on
one
side
of
it
half
a
dozen
broad
shelves
supported
a
goodly
row
of
volumes
among
which
the
golden
names
of
shakespeare
and
scott
glittered
invitingly
together
with
such
works
as
chapman
homer
byron
childe
harold
the
poems
of
john
keats
gibbon
rome
and
plutarch
while
mingled
with
these
were
the
devotional
works
in
french
of
alphonse
de
liguori
the
imitation
also
in
french
and
a
number
of
books
with
titles
in
norwegian
altogether
an
heterogenous
collection
of
literature
yet
not
without
interest
as
displaying
taste
and
culture
on
the
part
of
those
to
whom
it
belonged
errington
himself
learned
in
books
was
surprised
to
see
so
many
standard
works
in
the
library
of
one
who
professed
to
be
nothing
but
a
norwegian
farmer
and
his
respect
for
the
sturdy
old
increased
there
were
no
pictures
in
the
room
the
wide
lattice
window
on
one
hand
looking
out
on
the
roses
and
and
the
other
smaller
one
close
to
the
entrance
door
from
which
the
fjord
was
distinctly
visible
were
sufficient
pictures
in
themselves
to
need
no
others
the
furniture
was
roughly
made
of
pine
and
seemed
to
have
been
carved
by
hand
some
of
the
chairs
were
very
quaint
and
pretty
and
would
have
sold
in
a
shop
for
more
than
a
sovereign
apiece
on
the
wide
was
a
quantity
of
curious
old
china
that
seemed
to
have
been
picked
up
from
all
parts
of
the
world
most
of
it
was
undoubtedly
valuable
in
one
dark
corner
stood
an
ancient
harp
then
there
was
the
itself
a
curiosity
fit
for
a
museum
testifying
dumbly
of
the
mistress
of
all
these
surroundings
and
on
the
floor
there
was
something
else
something
that
both
the
young
men
were
strongly
inclined
to
take
possession
of
it
was
only
a
bunch
of
tiny
meadow
daisies
fastened
together
with
a
bit
of
blue
silk
it
had
fallen
they
guessed
by
whom
it
had
been
worn
but
neither
made
any
remark
and
both
by
some
strange
instinct
avoided
looking
at
it
as
though
the
innocent
little
blossoms
carried
within
them
some
terrible
temptation
they
were
conscious
of
a
certain
embarrassment
and
making
an
effort
to
break
through
it
lorimer
remarked
softly
by
jove
phil
if
this
old
güldmar
really
knew
what
you
are
up
to
i
believe
he
would
bundle
you
out
of
this
place
like
a
tramp
did
you
feel
a
sneak
when
he
said
we
had
told
the
truth
like
men
philip
smiled
dreamily
he
was
seated
in
one
of
the
quaintly
carved
chairs
half
absorbed
in
what
was
evidently
a
pleasing
reverie
no
not
exactly
he
replied
because
we
tell
him
the
truth
we
did
want
to
know
him
and
he
worth
knowing
too
he
is
a
fellow
do
you
think
so
rather
assented
lorimer
with
emphasis
i
wish
there
were
any
hope
of
my
becoming
such
a
fine
old
buffer
in
my
it
would
be
worth
living
for
if
only
to
look
at
myself
in
the
glass
now
and
then
he
rather
startled
me
when
he
threw
down
that
knife
though
i
suppose
it
is
some
old
norwegian
custom
i
suppose
so
errington
answered
and
then
was
silent
for
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
old
farmer
returned
followed
by
a
girl
bearing
a
tray
glittering
with
flasks
of
italian
wine
and
long
graceful
glasses
shaped
like
round
goblets
set
on
particularly
slender
stems
the
sight
of
the
girl
disappointed
the
eager
visitors
for
though
she
was
undeniably
pretty
she
was
not
thelma
she
was
short
and
plump
with
rebellious
locks
that
rippled
about
her
face
and
from
under
her
close
white
cap
with
persistent
untidiness
her
cheeks
were
as
round
and
red
as
and
she
had
dancing
blue
eyes
that
appeared
for
ever
engaged
in
efforts
to
outsparkle
each
other
she
wore
a
spotless
apron
lavishly
trimmed
with
coquettish
little
starched
frills
her
hands
were
unfortunately
rather
large
and
coarse
but
her
smile
as
she
set
down
the
tray
and
curtsied
respectfully
to
the
young
men
was
charming
disclosing
as
it
did
tiny
teeth
as
even
and
white
as
a
double
row
of
small
pearls
that
is
well
britta
said
güldmar
speaking
in
english
and
assisting
her
to
place
the
glasses
now
quick
run
after
thy
mistress
to
the
shore
her
boat
can
not
yet
have
left
the
creek
bid
her
return
and
come
to
me
tell
her
there
are
friends
here
who
will
be
glad
of
her
presence
britta
hurried
away
at
once
but
errington
heart
sank
thelma
had
gone
gone
most
probably
for
one
of
those
erratic
journeys
across
the
fjord
to
the
cave
where
he
had
first
seen
her
she
would
not
come
back
he
felt
certain
not
even
at
her
father
request
would
that
beautiful
proud
maiden
consent
to
alter
her
plans
what
an
unlucky
destiny
was
his
absorbed
in
disappointed
reflections
he
scarcely
heard
the
enthusiastic
praises
lorimer
was
diplomatically
bestowing
on
the
wine
he
hardly
felt
its
mellow
flavor
on
his
own
palate
though
it
was
in
truth
delicious
and
fit
for
the
table
of
a
monarch
güldmar
noticed
the
young
baronet
abstraction
and
addressed
him
with
genial
kindness
are
you
thinking
sir
philip
of
my
rough
speeches
to
you
yonder
no
offense
was
meant
no
offense
the
old
fellow
paused
and
laughed
over
his
yet
i
may
as
well
be
honest
about
it
offense
meant
but
when
i
found
that
none
was
taken
my
humor
changed
a
slight
smile
played
on
errington
lips
i
assure
you
sir
he
said
i
agreed
with
you
then
and
agree
with
you
now
in
every
word
you
uttered
you
took
my
measure
very
correctly
and
allow
me
to
add
that
no
one
can
be
more
conscious
of
my
own
insignificance
that
i
am
myself
the
days
we
live
in
are
insignificant
the
chronicle
of
our
paltry
doings
will
be
skipped
by
future
readers
of
the
history
among
a
society
of
particularly
useless
men
i
feel
myself
to
be
one
of
the
most
useless
if
you
could
show
me
any
way
to
make
my
life
valuable
he
paused
abruptly
and
his
heart
beat
with
inexplicable
rapidity
a
light
step
and
the
rustle
of
a
dress
was
heard
coming
through
the
porch
another
perfumed
shower
of
fell
softly
on
the
garden
path
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
a
tall
fair
figure
shone
forth
from
the
dark
background
of
the
outer
passage
a
figure
that
hesitated
on
the
threshold
and
then
advanced
noiselessly
and
with
a
reluctant
shyness
the
old
turned
round
in
his
chair
with
a
smile
ah
here
she
is
he
said
fondly
where
hast
thou
been
my
thelma
chapter
vi
and
sigurd
the
bishop
said
old
gods
are
not
dead
for
the
great
thor
still
reigns
and
among
the
jarls
and
thanes
the
old
witchcraft
is
spread
longfellow
of
king
the
girl
stood
silent
and
a
faint
blush
crimsoned
her
cheeks
the
young
men
had
risen
at
her
entrance
and
in
one
fleeting
glance
she
recognized
errington
though
she
gave
no
sign
to
that
effect
see
my
darling
continued
her
father
here
are
english
visitors
to
norway
this
is
sir
philip
errington
who
travels
through
our
wild
waters
in
the
great
steam
yacht
now
at
anchor
in
the
fjord
and
this
is
his
friend
lorimer
have
i
caught
your
name
rightly
my
lad
he
continued
turning
to
george
lorimer
with
a
kindly
smile
you
have
sir
answered
that
gentleman
promptly
and
then
he
was
mute
feeling
curiously
abashed
in
the
presence
of
this
young
lady
who
encircled
by
her
father
arm
raised
her
deep
dazzling
blue
eyes
and
serenely
bent
her
stately
head
to
him
as
his
name
was
mentioned
the
old
farmer
went
on
welcome
them
thelma
mine
friends
are
scarce
in
these
days
and
we
must
not
be
ungrateful
for
good
company
what
what
i
know
honest
lads
when
i
see
them
smile
on
them
my
thelma
and
then
we
will
warm
their
hearts
with
another
cup
of
wine
as
he
spoke
the
maiden
advanced
with
a
graceful
even
noble
air
and
extending
both
her
hands
to
each
of
the
visitors
in
turn
she
said
i
am
your
servant
friends
in
entering
this
house
you
do
possess
it
peace
and
heart
greeting
the
words
were
a
literal
translation
of
a
salutation
perfectly
common
in
many
parts
of
norway
a
mere
ordinary
expression
of
politeness
but
uttered
in
the
tender
penetrating
tones
of
the
most
musical
voice
they
had
ever
heard
and
accompanied
by
the
warm
frank
double
handclasp
of
those
soft
small
daintily
shaped
hands
the
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
generally
fashionably
bred
young
men
of
the
world
was
to
confuse
and
bewilder
them
to
the
last
degree
what
could
they
answer
to
this
poetical
quaint
formula
of
welcome
the
usual
latitudes
such
as
delighted
i
sure
or
most
happy
am
charmed
to
meet
you
no
these
remarks
deemed
intelligent
by
the
lady
rulers
of
london
would
they
felt
never
do
here
as
well
put
a
gentleman
in
modern
evening
dress
with
a
scornfully
beautiful
statue
of
apollo
as
trot
out
threadbare
insincere
commonplaces
in
the
hearing
of
this
child
of
nature
whose
pure
perfect
face
seemed
to
silently
repel
the
very
passing
shadow
of
a
falsehood
philip
brain
whirled
round
and
about
in
search
of
some
suitable
reply
but
could
find
none
and
lorimer
felt
himself
blushing
like
a
schoolboy
as
he
stammered
out
something
incoherent
and
eminently
foolish
though
he
had
sense
enough
left
to
appreciate
the
pressure
of
those
lovely
hands
as
long
as
it
lasted
thelma
however
appeared
not
to
notice
their
deep
embarrassment
she
had
not
yet
done
with
them
taking
the
largest
goblet
on
the
table
she
filled
it
to
the
brim
with
wine
and
touched
it
with
her
lips
then
with
a
smile
in
which
a
thousand
radiating
sunbeams
seemed
to
quiver
and
sparkle
she
lifted
it
towards
errington
the
grace
of
her
attitude
and
action
wakened
him
out
of
his
state
of
dreamy
bewilderment
in
his
soul
he
devoutly
blessed
these
ancient
family
customs
and
arose
to
the
occasion
like
a
man
clasping
with
a
tender
reverence
the
hands
that
upheld
the
goblet
he
bent
his
handsome
head
and
drank
a
deep
draught
while
his
dark
curls
almost
touched
her
fair
ones
and
then
an
insane
jealousy
possessed
him
for
a
moment
as
he
watched
her
go
through
the
same
ceremony
with
lorimer
she
next
carried
the
now
more
than
cup
to
the
and
said
as
she
held
it
laughing
softly
drink
it
all
father
if
you
leave
a
drop
you
know
these
gentlemen
will
quarrel
with
us
or
you
with
them
that
is
true
said
olaf
güldmar
with
great
gravity
but
it
will
not
be
my
fault
child
nor
the
fault
of
wasted
wine
and
he
drained
the
glass
to
its
dregs
and
set
it
upside
down
on
the
table
with
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
refreshment
the
ceremony
concluded
it
was
evident
the
ice
of
reserve
was
considered
broken
for
thelma
seated
herself
like
a
young
queen
and
motioned
her
visitors
to
do
the
same
with
a
gesture
of
gracious
condescension
how
did
you
find
your
way
here
she
asked
with
sweet
yet
direct
abruptness
giving
sir
philip
a
quick
glance
in
which
there
was
a
sparkle
of
mirth
though
her
long
lashes
veiled
it
almost
instantly
her
entire
lack
of
stiffness
and
reserve
set
the
young
men
at
their
ease
and
they
fell
into
conversation
freely
though
errington
allowed
lorimer
to
tell
the
story
of
their
trespass
in
his
own
fashion
without
interference
he
instinctively
felt
that
the
young
lady
who
listened
with
so
demure
a
smile
to
that
plausible
narrative
knew
well
enough
the
real
motive
that
had
brought
them
thither
though
she
apparently
had
her
own
reasons
for
keeping
silence
on
the
point
as
whatever
she
may
have
thought
she
said
nothing
lorimer
skillfully
avoided
betraying
the
fact
that
they
had
watched
her
through
the
window
and
had
listened
to
her
singing
and
thelma
heard
all
the
explanations
patiently
till
bosekop
was
mentioned
and
then
her
fair
face
grew
cold
and
stern
from
whom
did
you
hear
of
us
there
she
inquired
we
do
not
mix
with
the
people
why
should
they
speak
of
us
the
truth
is
interposed
errington
resting
his
eyes
with
a
sense
of
deep
delight
on
the
beautiful
rounded
figure
and
lovely
features
that
were
turned
towards
him
i
heard
of
you
first
through
my
pilot
one
valdemar
svensen
ha
ha
cried
old
güldmar
with
some
excitement
there
is
a
fellow
who
can
not
hold
his
tongue
what
have
i
said
to
thee
child
a
bachelor
is
no
better
than
a
gossiping
old
woman
he
that
is
always
alone
must
talk
if
it
be
only
to
woods
and
waves
it
is
the
married
men
who
know
best
how
excellent
it
is
to
keep
silence
they
all
laughed
though
thelma
eyes
had
a
way
of
looking
pensive
even
when
she
smiled
you
would
not
blame
poor
svensen
because
he
is
alone
father
she
said
is
he
not
to
be
pitied
surely
it
is
a
cruel
fate
to
have
none
to
love
in
all
the
wide
world
nothing
can
be
more
cruel
güldmar
surveyed
her
humorously
hear
her
he
said
she
talks
as
if
she
knew
all
about
such
things
and
if
ever
a
child
was
ignorant
of
sorrow
surely
it
is
my
thelma
every
flower
and
bird
in
the
place
loves
her
yes
i
have
thought
sometimes
the
very
sea
loves
her
it
must
she
is
so
much
upon
it
and
as
for
her
old
father
he
laughed
a
little
though
a
suspicious
moisture
softened
his
keen
eyes
why
he
love
her
at
all
ask
her
she
knows
it
thelma
rose
quickly
and
kissed
him
how
deliciously
those
sweet
lips
pouted
thought
errington
and
what
an
unreasonable
and
extraordinary
grudge
he
seemed
to
bear
towards
the
venerable
for
accepting
that
kiss
with
so
little
apparent
emotion
hush
father
she
said
these
friends
can
see
too
plainly
how
much
you
spoil
me
tell
me
and
she
turned
with
a
sudden
pretty
imperiousness
to
lorimer
who
started
at
her
voice
as
a
racehorse
starts
at
its
rider
touch
what
person
in
bosekop
spoke
of
us
lorimer
was
rather
at
a
loss
inasmuch
as
no
one
in
the
small
town
had
actually
spoken
of
them
and
dyceworthy
remarks
concerning
those
who
were
ejected
with
good
reason
from
respectable
society
might
not
after
all
have
applied
to
the
güldmar
family
indeed
it
now
seemed
an
absurd
and
improbable
supposition
therefore
he
replied
cautiously
the
reverend
dyceworthy
i
think
has
some
knowledge
of
you
is
he
not
a
friend
of
yours
these
simple
words
had
a
most
unexpected
effect
olaf
güldmar
sprang
up
from
his
seat
flaming
with
wrath
it
was
in
vain
that
his
daughter
laid
a
restraining
hand
upon
his
arm
the
name
of
the
lutheran
divine
had
sufficed
to
put
him
in
a
towering
passion
and
he
turned
furiously
upon
the
astonished
errington
had
i
known
you
came
from
the
devil
sir
you
should
have
returned
to
him
speedily
with
hot
words
to
hasten
your
departure
i
would
have
split
that
glass
to
atoms
before
i
would
have
drained
it
after
you
the
friends
of
a
false
heart
are
no
friends
for
me
the
followers
of
a
pretended
sanctity
find
no
welcome
under
my
roof
why
not
have
told
me
at
once
that
you
came
as
spies
hounded
on
by
the
liar
dyceworthy
why
not
have
confessed
it
openly
and
not
have
played
the
trick
on
an
old
fool
who
for
once
misled
by
your
manly
and
upright
bearing
consented
to
lay
aside
the
rightful
suspicions
he
at
first
entertained
of
your
purpose
shame
on
you
young
men
shame
the
words
coursed
impetuously
from
his
lips
his
face
burned
with
indignation
he
had
broken
away
from
his
daughter
hold
while
she
pale
and
very
still
stood
leaning
one
hand
upon
the
table
his
white
hair
was
tossed
back
from
his
brow
his
eyes
flashed
his
attitude
though
vengeful
and
threatening
was
at
the
same
time
so
bold
and
commanding
that
lorimer
caught
himself
lazily
admiring
the
contour
of
his
figure
and
wondering
how
he
would
look
in
marble
as
an
infuriated
viking
one
excellent
thing
in
the
dispositions
of
both
errington
and
lorimer
was
that
they
never
lost
temper
either
they
were
too
lazy
or
too
undoubtedly
they
both
considered
it
bad
form
this
indifference
stood
them
in
good
stead
now
they
showed
no
sign
whatever
of
offense
though
the
old
farmer
outbreak
of
wrath
was
so
sudden
and
unlooked
for
that
they
remained
for
a
moment
silent
out
of
sheer
surprise
then
rising
with
unruffled
serenity
they
took
up
their
caps
preparatory
to
departure
errington
gentle
refined
voice
broke
the
silence
you
are
in
error
güldmar
he
said
in
chilly
but
perfectly
polite
tones
i
regret
you
should
be
so
hasty
in
your
judgment
of
us
if
you
accepted
us
as
when
you
first
met
us
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
should
now
take
us
for
spies
the
two
terms
are
by
no
means
synonymous
i
know
nothing
of
dyceworthy
beyond
that
he
called
upon
me
and
that
i
as
in
duty
bound
returned
his
call
i
am
ignorant
of
his
character
and
disposition
i
may
add
that
i
have
no
desire
to
be
enlightened
respecting
them
i
do
not
often
take
a
dislike
to
anybody
but
it
so
happens
that
i
have
done
so
in
the
case
of
dyceworthy
i
know
lorimer
does
care
for
him
and
i
do
think
my
other
two
friends
are
particularly
attached
to
him
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
except
that
i
fear
we
have
outstayed
our
welcome
permit
us
now
to
wish
you
good
evening
and
you
he
hesitated
and
turned
with
a
low
bow
to
thelma
who
had
listened
to
his
words
with
a
gradually
dawning
brightness
on
her
face
you
will
i
trust
exonerate
us
from
any
intentional
offense
towards
your
father
or
yourself
our
visit
has
proved
unlucky
but
thelma
interrupted
him
by
laying
her
fair
little
hand
on
his
arm
with
a
wistful
detaining
gesture
which
though
seemingly
familiar
was
yet
perfectly
sweet
and
natural
the
light
touch
thrilled
his
blood
and
sent
it
coursing
through
his
veins
at
more
than
customary
speed
ah
then
you
also
will
be
foolish
she
said
with
a
naïve
protecting
air
of
superior
dignity
do
you
not
see
my
father
is
sorry
have
we
all
kissed
the
cup
for
nothing
or
was
the
wine
wasted
not
a
drop
was
spilt
how
then
if
we
are
friends
should
we
part
in
coldness
father
it
is
you
to
be
ashamed
not
these
gentleman
who
are
strangers
to
the
altenfjord
and
know
nothing
of
dyceworthy
or
an
other
person
dwelling
here
and
when
their
vessel
sails
away
again
over
the
wide
seas
to
their
own
shores
how
will
you
have
them
think
of
you
as
one
whose
heart
was
all
kindness
and
who
helped
to
make
their
days
pass
pleasantly
or
as
one
who
in
unreasonable
anger
forgot
the
duties
of
sworn
hospitality
the
listened
to
her
full
sweet
reproachful
voice
as
a
tough
old
lion
might
listen
to
the
voice
of
its
tamer
uncertain
whether
to
yield
or
spring
he
wiped
his
heated
brow
and
stared
around
him
shamefacedly
finally
as
though
swallowing
his
pride
with
a
gulp
he
drew
a
long
breath
took
a
couple
of
determined
strides
forward
and
held
out
his
hands
one
to
errington
and
the
other
to
lorimer
by
whom
they
were
warmly
grasped
there
my
lads
he
said
rapidly
i
sorry
i
spoke
forgive
and
forget
that
is
the
worst
of
me
my
blood
is
up
in
a
minute
and
old
though
i
am
i
not
old
enough
yet
to
be
patient
and
when
i
hear
the
name
of
that
sneak
dyceworthy
by
the
gates
of
valhalla
i
feel
as
if
my
own
house
would
not
hold
me
no
no
do
go
yet
nearly
ten
well
no
matter
the
night
is
like
the
day
here
you
see
it
does
matter
when
one
goes
to
bed
come
and
sit
in
the
porch
awhile
i
shall
get
cool
out
there
ah
thelma
child
i
see
thee
laughing
at
thy
old
temper
never
mind
never
mind
is
it
not
for
thy
sake
after
all
and
holding
errington
by
the
arm
he
led
the
way
into
the
fine
old
porch
lorimer
following
with
rather
a
flushed
face
for
he
as
he
passed
out
of
the
room
had
managed
to
pick
up
and
secrete
the
neglected
little
bunch
of
daisies
before
noticed
as
having
fallen
on
the
floor
he
put
them
quickly
in
his
breast
pocket
with
a
curious
sense
of
satisfaction
though
he
had
no
intention
of
keeping
them
and
leaned
idly
against
the
clambering
roses
watching
thelma
as
she
drew
a
low
stool
to
her
father
feet
and
sat
there
a
balmy
wind
blew
in
from
the
fjord
and
rustled
mysteriously
among
the
pines
the
sky
was
flecked
here
and
there
with
fleecy
clouds
and
a
number
of
birds
were
singing
in
full
chorus
old
güldmar
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
though
his
recent
outburst
of
passion
had
done
him
good
i
will
tell
you
sir
philip
he
said
ruffling
his
daughter
curls
as
he
spoke
i
will
tell
you
why
i
detest
the
villain
dyceworthy
it
is
but
fair
you
should
know
it
now
thelma
why
that
push
to
my
knee
you
fear
i
may
offend
our
friends
again
nay
i
will
take
good
care
and
so
first
of
all
i
ask
you
what
is
your
religion
though
i
know
you
can
not
be
lutherans
errington
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
question
he
smiled
my
dear
sir
he
replied
at
last
to
be
frank
with
you
i
really
do
not
think
i
have
any
religion
if
i
had
i
suppose
i
should
call
myself
a
christian
though
judging
from
the
behavior
of
christians
in
general
i
can
not
be
one
of
them
after
all
for
i
belong
to
no
sect
i
go
to
no
church
and
i
have
never
read
a
tract
in
my
life
i
have
a
profound
reverence
and
admiration
for
the
character
and
doctrine
of
christ
and
i
believe
if
i
had
had
the
privilege
of
knowing
and
conversing
with
him
i
should
not
have
deserted
him
in
extremity
as
his
timorous
disciples
did
i
believe
in
an
creator
so
you
see
i
am
not
an
atheist
my
mother
was
an
austrian
and
a
catholic
and
i
have
a
notion
that
as
a
small
child
i
was
brought
up
in
that
creed
but
i
afraid
i
do
know
much
about
it
now
the
nodded
gravely
thelma
here
he
said
is
a
catholic
as
her
mother
was
he
stopped
abruptly
and
a
deep
shadow
of
pain
darkened
his
features
thelma
looked
up
her
large
blue
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
and
she
pressed
her
father
hand
between
her
own
as
though
in
sympathy
with
some
undeclared
grief
then
she
looked
at
errington
with
a
sort
of
wistful
appeal
philip
heart
leaped
as
he
met
that
soft
beseeching
glance
which
seemed
to
entreat
his
patience
with
the
old
man
for
her
sake
he
felt
himself
drawn
into
a
bond
of
union
with
her
thoughts
and
in
his
innermost
soul
he
swore
as
knightly
a
vow
of
chivalry
and
reverence
for
the
fair
maiden
who
thus
took
him
into
her
silent
confidence
as
though
he
were
some
gallant
crusader
of
old
time
pledged
to
defend
his
lady
honor
unto
death
olaf
güldmar
after
a
long
and
apparently
sorrowful
pause
resumed
his
conversation
yes
he
said
thelma
is
a
catholic
though
here
she
has
scarcely
any
opportunity
for
performing
the
duties
of
her
religion
it
is
a
pretty
and
a
graceful
creed
well
fitted
for
women
as
for
me
i
am
made
of
sterner
stuff
and
the
maxims
of
that
gentle
creature
christ
find
no
echo
in
my
soul
but
you
young
sir
he
added
turning
suddenly
on
lorimer
who
was
engaged
in
meditatively
smoothing
out
on
his
palm
one
of
the
fallen
you
have
not
spoken
what
faith
do
you
profess
it
is
no
curiosity
that
prompts
me
to
ask
i
only
seek
not
to
offend
lorimer
laughed
languidly
upon
my
life
güldmar
you
really
ask
too
much
of
me
i
have
any
faith
at
all
not
a
shred
it
been
all
knocked
out
of
me
i
tried
to
hold
on
to
a
last
remaining
bit
of
christian
rope
in
the
universal
but
that
was
torn
out
of
my
hands
by
a
scientific
professor
who
ought
to
know
what
he
is
about
and
and
now
i
drift
along
anyhow
güldmar
smiled
dubiously
but
thelma
looked
at
the
speaker
with
astonished
regretful
eyes
i
am
sorry
she
said
simply
you
must
be
often
unhappy
lorimer
was
not
disconcerted
though
her
evident
pity
caused
an
unwanted
flush
on
his
face
oh
no
he
said
in
answer
to
her
i
am
not
a
miserable
sort
of
fellow
by
any
means
for
instance
i
not
afraid
of
death
lots
of
very
religious
people
are
horribly
afraid
of
it
though
they
all
the
time
declare
it
the
only
path
to
heaven
they
not
consistent
at
all
you
see
i
believe
in
nothing
i
came
from
nothing
i
am
nothing
i
shall
be
nothing
that
being
plain
i
am
all
right
güldmar
laughed
you
are
an
odd
lad
he
said
you
are
in
the
morning
of
life
there
are
always
mists
in
the
morning
as
there
are
in
the
evening
in
the
light
of
your
full
manhood
you
will
see
these
things
differently
your
creed
of
nothing
provides
no
moral
law
no
hold
on
the
conscience
no
restraint
on
the
passions
do
you
see
that
lorimer
smiled
with
a
very
winning
and
boyish
candor
you
are
exceedingly
good
sir
to
credit
me
with
a
conscience
i
do
think
i
have
one
i
sure
i
have
no
passions
i
have
always
been
too
lazy
to
encourage
them
and
as
for
moral
law
i
adhere
to
morality
with
the
greatest
strictness
because
if
a
fellow
is
immoral
he
ceases
to
be
a
gentleman
now
as
there
are
very
few
gentlemen
nowadays
i
fancy
like
to
be
one
as
long
as
i
can
errington
here
interposed
you
must
take
him
seriously
güldmar
he
said
he
never
serious
himself
i
give
you
his
character
in
a
few
words
he
belongs
to
no
religious
party
true
but
he
a
fellow
the
best
fellow
i
know
lorimer
glanced
at
him
quietly
with
a
gratified
expression
on
his
face
but
he
said
nothing
for
thelma
was
regarding
him
with
a
most
bewitching
smile
ah
she
said
shaking
a
reproachful
finger
at
him
you
do
love
all
nonsense
that
i
can
see
you
would
make
every
person
laugh
if
you
could
is
it
not
so
well
yes
admitted
george
i
think
i
would
but
it
a
herculean
task
sometimes
if
you
had
ever
been
to
london
miss
güldmar
you
would
understand
how
difficult
it
is
to
make
people
even
smile
and
when
they
do
the
smile
is
not
a
very
natural
one
why
she
exclaimed
are
they
all
so
miserable
they
pretend
to
be
if
they
not
said
lorimer
it
is
the
fashion
there
to
find
fault
with
everything
and
everybody
that
is
so
said
güldmar
thoughtfully
i
visited
london
once
and
thought
i
was
in
hell
nothing
but
rows
of
hard
hideously
built
houses
long
streets
and
dirty
alleys
and
the
people
had
weary
faces
all
as
though
nature
had
refused
to
bless
them
a
pitiful
city
doubly
pitiful
to
the
eyes
of
a
man
like
myself
whose
life
has
been
passed
among
fjords
and
mountains
such
as
these
well
now
as
neither
of
you
are
lutherans
in
fact
as
neither
of
you
seem
to
know
what
you
are
and
he
laughed
i
can
be
frank
and
speak
out
as
to
my
own
belief
i
am
proud
to
say
i
have
never
deserted
the
faith
of
my
fathers
the
faith
that
makes
a
man
soul
strong
and
fearless
and
defiant
of
evil
the
faith
that
is
supposed
to
be
crushed
out
among
us
but
that
is
still
alive
and
rooted
in
the
hearts
of
many
who
can
trace
back
their
lineage
to
the
ancient
vikings
as
i
can
yes
rooted
firm
and
fast
and
however
much
some
of
the
more
timorous
feign
to
conceal
it
in
the
tacit
acceptance
of
another
creed
there
are
those
who
can
never
shake
it
off
and
who
never
desire
to
forsake
it
i
am
one
of
these
few
shame
must
fall
on
the
man
who
willfully
deserts
the
faith
of
his
sacred
to
me
for
ever
be
the
names
of
odin
and
thor
he
raised
his
hand
aloft
with
a
proud
gesture
and
his
eyes
flashed
errington
was
interested
but
not
surprised
the
old
declaration
of
his
creed
seemed
eminently
fitted
to
his
character
lorimer
face
brightened
here
was
a
novelty
a
man
who
in
all
the
conflicting
storms
of
modern
opinion
sturdily
clung
to
the
traditions
of
his
forefathers
by
jove
he
exclaimed
eagerly
i
think
the
worship
of
odin
would
suit
me
perfectly
it
a
rousing
fighting
sort
of
religion
i
positive
it
would
make
a
man
of
me
will
you
initiate
me
into
the
mysteries
güldmar
there
a
fellow
in
london
who
writes
poetry
on
indian
subjects
and
who
it
is
said
thinks
buddhism
might
satisfy
his
pious
yearnings
but
i
think
odin
would
be
a
personage
to
command
more
respect
than
buddha
at
any
rate
i
should
like
to
try
him
will
you
give
me
a
chance
olaf
güldmar
smiled
gravely
and
rising
from
his
seat
pointed
to
the
western
sky
see
yonder
threads
of
filmy
white
he
said
that
stretch
across
the
wide
expanse
of
blue
they
are
the
lingering
fading
marks
of
light
clouds
and
even
while
we
watch
them
they
shall
pass
and
be
no
more
such
is
the
emblem
of
your
life
young
man
you
that
would
for
an
idle
jest
or
pastime
presume
to
search
into
the
mysteries
of
odin
for
you
they
are
not
your
spirit
is
not
of
the
stern
mould
that
waits
for
death
as
gladly
as
the
bridegroom
waits
for
the
bride
the
christian
heaven
is
an
abode
for
girls
and
babes
valhalla
is
the
place
for
men
i
tell
you
my
creed
is
as
divine
in
its
origin
as
any
that
ever
existed
on
the
earth
the
rainbow
bridge
is
a
fairer
pathway
from
death
to
life
than
the
doleful
cross
and
better
far
the
dark
summoning
eyes
of
a
beauteous
valkyrie
than
the
grinning
skull
and
the
christian
emblem
of
mortality
thelma
thinks
and
her
mother
before
her
thought
also
that
different
as
my
way
of
belief
is
to
the
accepted
new
creeds
of
it
will
be
all
right
with
me
in
the
next
world
that
i
shall
have
as
good
a
place
in
heaven
as
any
christian
it
may
be
so
i
care
not
but
see
you
the
of
all
the
civilization
of
is
discontent
while
i
thanks
to
the
gods
of
my
fathers
am
happy
and
desire
nothing
that
i
have
not
he
paused
and
seemed
absorbed
the
young
men
watched
his
fine
inspired
features
with
lively
interest
thelma
head
was
turned
away
from
them
so
that
her
face
was
hidden
he
resumed
in
quieter
tones
now
my
lads
you
know
what
we
are
both
of
us
accursed
in
the
opinion
of
the
lutheran
community
my
child
belongs
to
the
idolatrous
church
of
rome
i
am
one
of
the
very
last
of
the
barbarians
and
the
old
fellow
smiled
sarcastically
though
truth
to
tell
for
a
barbarian
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
some
folks
would
have
you
think
if
the
snuffling
dyceworthy
and
i
competed
at
a
spelling
examination
i
pretty
sure
is
i
would
have
the
prize
but
as
i
said
you
know
us
and
if
our
ways
are
likely
to
offend
you
then
let
us
part
good
friends
before
the
swords
are
fairly
drawn
no
sword
will
be
drawn
on
my
side
i
assure
you
sir
said
errington
advancing
and
laying
one
hand
on
the
shoulder
i
hope
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
i
shall
esteem
it
an
honor
and
a
privilege
to
know
more
of
you
and
though
you
wo
accept
me
as
a
servant
of
odin
added
lorimer
you
really
can
not
prevent
me
from
trying
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
you
i
warn
you
güldmar
i
shall
visit
you
pretty
frequently
such
men
as
you
are
not
often
met
with
olaf
güldmar
looked
surprised
you
really
mean
it
he
said
nothing
that
i
have
told
you
affects
you
you
still
seek
our
friendship
they
both
earnestly
assured
him
that
they
did
and
as
they
spoke
thelma
rose
from
her
low
seat
and
faced
them
with
a
bright
smile
do
you
know
she
said
that
you
are
the
first
people
who
on
visiting
us
once
have
ever
cared
to
come
again
ah
you
look
surprised
but
it
is
so
is
it
not
father
güldmar
nodded
a
grave
assent
yes
she
continued
demurely
counting
on
her
little
white
fingers
we
are
three
things
first
we
are
accursed
secondly
we
have
the
evil
eye
thirdly
we
are
not
respectable
and
she
broke
into
a
peal
of
laughter
ringing
and
sweet
as
a
chime
of
bells
the
young
men
joined
her
in
it
and
still
with
an
amused
expression
on
her
lovely
face
leaning
her
head
back
against
a
cluster
of
pale
roses
she
went
on
my
father
dislikes
dyceworthy
so
much
because
he
wants
to
to
oh
what
is
it
they
do
to
savages
father
yes
i
know
to
convert
us
to
make
us
lutherans
and
when
he
finds
it
all
no
use
he
is
angry
and
though
he
is
so
religious
if
he
hears
any
one
telling
some
untruth
about
us
in
bosekop
he
will
add
another
thing
equally
untrue
and
so
it
grows
and
grows
and
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
as
errington
scowled
and
clenched
his
fist
in
a
peculiarly
threatening
manner
i
should
like
to
knock
him
down
he
said
briefly
under
his
breath
old
güldmar
laughed
and
looked
at
the
young
baronet
approvingly
who
knows
who
knows
he
said
cheerfully
you
may
do
it
some
day
it
will
be
a
good
deed
i
will
do
it
myself
if
he
troubles
me
much
more
and
now
let
us
make
some
arrangement
with
you
when
will
you
come
and
see
us
again
you
must
visit
me
first
said
sir
philip
quickly
if
you
and
your
daughter
will
honor
me
with
your
company
i
shall
be
proud
and
pleased
consider
the
yacht
at
your
service
thelma
resting
among
the
roses
looked
across
at
him
with
serious
questioning
eyes
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
asking
his
intentions
towards
both
her
and
her
father
güldmar
accepted
the
invitation
at
once
and
the
hour
for
their
visit
next
day
being
fixed
and
agreed
upon
the
young
men
began
to
take
their
leave
as
errington
clasped
thelma
hand
in
farewell
he
made
a
bold
venture
he
touched
a
rose
that
hung
just
above
her
head
almost
dropping
on
her
hair
may
i
have
it
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
their
eyes
met
the
girl
flushed
deeply
and
then
grew
pale
she
broke
off
the
flower
and
gave
it
to
him
then
turned
to
lorimer
to
say
they
left
her
then
standing
under
the
porch
shading
her
brow
with
one
hand
from
the
glittering
sunlight
as
she
watched
them
descending
the
winding
path
to
the
shore
accompanied
by
her
lather
who
hospitably
insisted
on
seeing
them
into
their
boat
they
looked
back
once
or
twice
always
to
see
the
slender
tall
white
figure
standing
there
like
an
angel
resting
in
a
bower
of
roses
with
the
sunshine
flashing
on
a
golden
crown
of
hair
at
the
last
in
the
pathway
philip
raised
his
hat
and
waved
it
but
whether
she
condescended
to
wave
her
hand
in
answer
he
could
not
see
left
alone
she
sighed
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
to
resume
her
spinning
hearing
the
whirr
of
the
wheel
the
servant
britta
entered
you
are
not
going
in
the
boat
fröken
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
mingled
deference
and
affection
thelma
looked
up
smiled
faintly
and
shook
her
head
in
the
negative
it
is
late
britta
and
i
am
tired
and
the
deep
blue
eyes
had
an
intense
dreamy
light
within
them
as
they
wandered
from
the
wheel
to
the
window
and
rested
on
the
majestic
darkness
of
the
overshadowing
solemn
pines

errington
and
lorimer
pulled
away
across
the
fjord
in
a
silence
that
lasted
for
many
minutes
old
güldmar
stood
on
the
edge
of
his
little
pier
to
watch
them
out
of
sight
so
till
their
boat
turned
the
sharp
corner
of
the
protecting
rock
that
hid
the
from
view
they
saw
his
picturesque
figure
and
gleaming
silvery
hair
outlined
clearly
against
the
background
of
the
sky
a
sky
now
tenderly
flushed
with
pink
like
the
inside
of
a
delicate
shell
when
they
could
no
longer
perceive
him
they
still
rowed
on
speaking
no
word
the
measured
musical
plash
of
the
oars
through
the
smooth
dark
water
alone
breaking
the
stillness
around
them
there
was
a
curious
sort
of
hushed
breathlessness
in
the
air
fantastic
lights
and
shadows
played
on
the
little
wrinkling
waves
sudden
flushes
of
crimson
came
and
went
in
the
western
horizon
and
over
the
high
summits
of
the
surrounding
mountains
mysterious
shapes
formed
of
purple
and
grey
mist
rose
up
and
crept
softly
downwards
winding
in
and
out
deep
valleys
and
dark
ravines
like
wandering
spirits
sent
on
some
secret
and
sorrowful
errand
after
a
while
errington
said
almost
vexedly
are
you
struck
dumb
george
have
you
a
word
to
say
to
a
fellow
just
what
i
was
about
to
ask
replied
lorimer
carelessly
and
i
was
also
going
to
remark
that
we
had
seen
your
mad
friend
up
at
the
güldmar
residence
no
yet
i
ca
help
thinking
he
has
something
to
do
with
them
all
the
same
returned
errington
meditatively
i
tell
you
he
swore
at
me
by
some
old
norwegian
infernal
place
or
other
i
dare
say
he
an
odin
worshipper
too
but
never
mind
him
what
do
you
think
of
lorimer
turned
lazily
round
in
the
boat
so
that
he
faced
his
companion
well
old
fellow
if
you
ask
me
frankly
i
think
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
saw
or
for
that
matter
ever
heard
of
and
i
am
an
impartial
critic
perfectly
impartial
and
resting
on
his
oar
he
dipped
the
blade
musingly
in
and
out
of
the
water
watching
the
bright
drops
fall
with
an
smoothness
as
they
trickled
from
the
polished
wood
and
glittered
in
the
late
sunshine
like
jewels
then
he
glanced
curiously
at
philip
who
sat
silent
but
whose
face
was
very
grave
and
earnest
even
noble
with
that
shade
of
profound
thought
upon
it
he
looked
like
one
who
had
suddenly
accepted
a
high
trust
in
which
there
was
not
only
pride
but
tenderness
lorimer
shook
himself
together
as
he
himself
would
have
expressed
it
and
touched
his
friend
arm
you
met
the
king
daughter
of
norroway
after
all
phil
and
his
light
accents
had
a
touch
of
sadness
in
them
and
you
have
to
bring
her
home
as
the
old
song
says
i
believe
the
is
caught
at
last
the
of
the
piece
has
turned
up
and
your
chum
must
play
second
fiddle
eh
old
boy
errington
flushed
hotly
but
caught
lorimer
hand
and
pressed
it
with
tremendous
fervor
by
jove
i
wring
it
off
your
wrist
if
you
talk
in
that
fashion
george
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
always
be
the
same
to
me
and
you
know
it
i
tell
you
and
he
pulled
his
moustache
doubtfully
i
do
know
quite
what
the
matter
with
me
that
girl
fascinates
me
i
feel
a
fool
in
her
presence
is
that
a
sign
of
being
in
love
i
wonder
certainly
not
returned
george
promptly
for
feel
a
fool
in
her
presence
and
i
not
in
love
how
do
you
know
that
and
errington
glanced
at
him
keenly
and
inquiringly
how
do
i
know
come
i
like
that
have
i
studied
myself
all
these
years
for
nothing
look
here
and
he
carefully
drew
out
the
little
withering
bunch
of
daisies
he
had
purloined
these
are
for
you
i
knew
you
wanted
them
though
you
had
the
impudence
to
pick
them
up
and
i
had
i
thought
you
might
like
to
put
them
under
your
pillow
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
because
if
one
is
resolved
to
become
one
may
as
well
do
the
thing
properly
out
and
out
i
hate
all
now
if
the
remotest
thrill
of
sentiment
were
in
me
you
can
understand
i
hope
that
wild
horses
would
not
have
torn
this
adorable
posy
from
my
possession
i
should
have
kept
it
and
you
would
never
have
known
of
it
and
he
laughed
softly
take
it
old
fellow
you
rich
now
with
the
rose
she
gave
you
besides
what
is
all
your
wealth
compared
with
the
sacred
preciousness
of
such
blossoms
there
do
look
so
awfully
estactic
or
i
shall
be
called
upon
to
ridicule
you
in
the
interests
of
common
sense
so
you
in
love
with
the
girl
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
do
beat
about
the
bush
i
not
sure
about
it
said
philip
taking
the
daisies
gratefully
however
and
pressing
them
in
his
i
do
believe
in
love
at
first
sight
i
do
returned
lorimer
decidedly
love
is
electricity
two
telegrams
are
enough
to
settle
the
business
one
from
the
eyes
of
the
man
the
other
from
those
of
the
woman
you
and
miss
güldmar
must
have
exchanged
a
dozen
such
messages
at
least
and
you
inquired
errington
persistently
you
had
the
same
chance
as
myself
george
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
dear
boy
there
are
no
wires
of
communication
between
the
and
myself
nothing
but
a
blank
innocent
landscape
over
which
perhaps
some
day
the
mild
lustre
of
friendship
may
beam
the
girl
is
beautiful
extraordinarily
so
but
not
a
o
wax
as
juliet
gabbling
old
nurse
says
not
in
the
least
impressionable
and
forthwith
he
resumed
his
oar
saying
briskly
as
he
did
so
phil
do
you
know
those
other
fellows
must
be
swearing
at
us
pretty
forcibly
for
leaving
them
so
long
with
dyceworthy
we
been
away
two
hours
not
possible
cried
errington
amazed
and
wielding
his
oar
vigorously
they
think
me
horribly
rude
by
jove
they
must
be
bored
to
death
and
stimulated
by
the
thought
of
the
penance
their
friends
were
enduring
they
sent
the
boat
spinning
swiftly
through
the
water
and
rowed
as
though
they
were
trying
for
a
race
when
they
were
suddenly
pulled
up
by
a
loud
halloo
and
the
sight
of
another
boat
coming
slowly
out
from
bosekop
wherein
two
individuals
were
standing
up
gesticulating
violently
there
they
are
exclaimed
lorimer
i
say
phil
they
hired
a
special
tub
and
are
coming
out
to
us
so
it
proved
duprèz
and
macfarlane
had
grown
tired
of
waiting
for
their
truant
companions
and
had
taken
the
first
clumsy
wherry
that
presented
itself
rowed
by
an
even
clumsier
norwegian
boatman
whom
they
had
been
compelled
to
engage
also
as
he
would
not
let
his
ugly
punt
out
of
his
sight
for
fear
some
harm
might
chance
to
befall
it
thus
attended
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
the
yacht
with
a
few
long
elegant
strokes
errington
and
lorimer
soon
brought
their
boat
alongside
and
their
friends
gladly
jumped
into
it
delighted
to
be
free
of
the
company
of
the
mariner
they
had
so
reluctantly
hired
and
who
now
on
receiving
his
fee
paddled
awkwardly
away
in
his
craft
without
either
a
word
of
thanks
or
salutation
errington
began
to
apologize
at
once
for
his
long
absence
giving
as
a
reason
for
it
the
necessity
he
found
himself
under
of
making
a
call
on
some
persons
of
importance
in
the
neighborhood
whom
he
had
till
now
forgotten
my
good
cried
duprèz
in
his
cheery
sing
song
accent
why
apologize
we
have
amused
ourselves
our
dear
sandy
has
a
vein
of
humor
that
is
astonishing
we
have
not
wasted
our
time
no
we
have
made
dyceworthy
our
slave
we
have
conquered
him
we
have
abased
him
he
is
what
we
please
he
is
for
all
gods
or
for
no
god
just
as
we
pull
the
string
in
plain
words
that
amiable
religious
is
drunk
drunk
cried
errington
and
lorimer
together
jove
you
do
mean
it
macfarlane
looked
up
with
a
twinkle
of
satirical
humor
in
his
grey
eyes
ye
see
he
said
seriously
the
lacrima
or
papist
wine
as
he
calls
it
was
strong
we
got
him
to
take
a
good
dose
a
vera
feir
dose
indeed
then
doun
he
sat
an
fell
to
convairsing
vera
pheelosophically
o
mony
things
it
wad
hae
done
ye
gude
to
hear
him
he
was
fair
lost
in
the
mazes
o
his
metapheesics
for
twa
flies
took
a
bit
saunter
through
the
pleasant
dewy
lanes
o
his
forehead
an
he
never
raised
a
finger
to
send
them
awa
aboot
their
beeziness
then
i
thoet
i
wad
try
him
wi
the
whusky
i
had
ma
pocket
flask
wi
me
an
o
mon
he
was
sairly
glad
and
gratefu
for
the
first
snack
he
said
it
was
deevilish
fine
stuff
an
so
he
took
ane
drappikie
an
anither
drappikie
and
yet
anither
drappikie
sandy
accent
got
more
and
more
pronounced
as
he
went
on
an
after
a
bit
his
heed
dropt
doun
an
he
took
a
wee
snoozle
of
a
minute
or
twa
then
he
woke
up
in
a
his
strength
an
just
grappit
the
flask
in
his
twa
hands
an
took
the
hale
off
at
a
grand
rousin
gulp
ma
certes
after
it
ye
shuld
ha
seen
him
laughin
like
a
feckless
fule
an
rubbin
an
rubbin
his
heed
till
his
hair
was
like
the
straw
kicked
roond
by
a
mad
coo
lorimer
lay
back
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
laughed
uproariously
at
this
extraordinary
picture
as
did
the
others
but
that
is
not
all
said
duprèz
with
delighted
mischief
sparkling
in
his
wicked
little
dark
eyes
the
dear
religious
opened
his
heart
to
us
he
spoke
thickly
but
we
could
understand
him
he
was
very
impressive
he
is
quite
of
my
opinion
he
says
all
religion
is
nonsense
fable
imposture
man
is
the
only
god
woman
his
creature
and
subject
again
man
and
woman
conjoined
make
up
divinity
necessity
law
he
was
quite
clear
on
that
point
why
did
he
preach
what
he
did
not
believe
we
asked
he
almost
wept
he
replied
that
the
children
of
this
world
liked
and
he
was
paid
to
tell
them
it
was
his
bread
and
butter
would
we
wish
him
to
have
no
bread
and
butter
we
assured
him
so
cruel
a
thought
had
no
place
in
our
hearts
then
he
is
amorous
yes
the
good
fat
man
is
amorous
he
would
have
become
a
priest
but
on
close
examination
of
the
confessionals
he
saw
there
was
no
possibility
of
seeing
much
less
kissing
a
lady
penitent
through
the
grating
so
he
gave
up
that
idea
in
his
form
of
faith
he
kiss
he
says
he
kiss
always
a
holy
kiss
of
course
he
is
so
ingenuous
so
delightfully
frank
it
is
quite
charming
they
laughed
again
sir
philip
looked
somewhat
disgusted
what
an
old
brute
he
must
be
he
said
somebody
ought
to
kick
him
a
holy
kick
of
course
and
therefore
more
intense
and
forcible
than
other
kicks
you
begin
phil
laughed
lorimer
and
we
all
follow
suit
he
be
like
that
indian
in
who
rolled
himself
into
a
ball
no
one
could
resist
kicking
as
long
as
the
ball
bounded
before
them
we
similarly
shall
not
be
able
to
resist
if
dyceworthy
fat
person
is
once
left
at
our
mercy
that
was
a
grand
bit
he
told
us
errington
resumed
macfarlane
ye
should
ha
heard
him
talk
aboot
his
the
saft
jelly
of
a
man
that
he
is
to
be
making
up
to
ony
woman
at
that
moment
they
ran
alongside
of
the
and
threw
up
their
oars
stop
a
bit
said
errington
tell
us
the
rest
on
board
the
ladder
was
lowered
they
mounted
it
and
their
boat
was
hauled
up
to
its
place
go
on
said
lorimer
throwing
himself
lazily
into
a
deck
and
lighting
a
cigar
while
the
others
leaned
against
the
yacht
rails
and
followed
his
example
go
on
sandy
this
is
fun
dyceworthy
amours
must
be
amusing
i
suppose
he
after
that
ugly
wooden
block
of
a
woman
we
saw
at
his
house
who
is
so
zealous
for
the
gospel
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
sandy
with
immense
gravity
the
auld
silenus
has
better
taste
he
says
there
a
young
lass
running
after
him
fit
to
break
her
heart
aboot
him
puir
thing
she
must
have
vera
little
choice
o
men
he
hasna
quite
made
up
his
mind
though
he
admeets
she
as
fine
a
lass
as
ony
man
need
require
he
sorely
afraid
she
has
set
herself
to
catch
him
as
he
says
she
an
eye
like
a
warlock
for
a
really
strong
fellow
like
himself
and
macfarlane
chuckled
audibly
maybe
he
take
pity
on
her
maybe
he
wont
the
misguided
lassie
will
be
sairly
teazed
by
him
from
a
he
tauld
us
in
his
cups
he
gave
us
her
name
the
oddest
in
a
the
warld
for
sure
i
canna
just
remember
it
i
can
said
duprèz
glibly
it
struck
me
as
quaint
and
pretty
thelma
güldmar
errington
started
so
violently
and
flushed
so
deeply
that
lorimer
was
afraid
of
some
rash
outbreak
of
wrath
on
his
part
but
he
restrained
himself
by
a
strong
effort
he
merely
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
puffed
a
light
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
air
before
replying
then
he
said
coldly
i
should
say
dyceworthy
besides
being
a
drunkard
is
a
most
consummate
liar
it
so
happens
that
the
güldmars
are
the
very
people
i
have
just
visited
highly
superior
in
every
way
to
anybody
we
have
yet
met
in
norway
in
fact
and
miss
güldmar
will
come
on
board
i
have
invited
them
to
dine
with
us
you
will
then
be
able
to
judge
for
yourselves
whether
the
young
lady
is
at
all
of
the
description
dyceworthy
gives
of
her
duprèz
and
macfarlane
exchanged
astonished
looks
are
ye
quite
sure
the
latter
ventured
to
remark
cautiously
that
ye
prudent
in
what
ye
have
done
remember
ye
have
asked
no
pairson
at
a
to
dine
with
ye
as
yet
it
a
vera
sudden
an
exceptional
freak
hospitality
errington
smoked
on
peacefully
and
made
no
answer
duprèz
hummed
a
verse
of
a
french
under
his
breath
and
smiled
lorimer
glanced
at
him
with
a
lazy
amusement
unburden
yourself
pierre
for
heaven
sake
he
said
your
mind
is
as
uncomfortable
as
a
loaded
camel
let
it
lie
down
while
you
take
off
its
packages
one
by
one
and
reveal
their
contents
in
short
up
duprèz
made
a
rapid
expressive
gesture
with
his
hands
i
fear
to
displease
he
has
invited
these
people
they
are
coming
there
is
no
more
to
say
i
disagree
with
ye
interposed
macfarlane
i
think
errington
should
hear
what
ha
heard
it
fair
an
just
to
a
mon
that
he
should
understand
what
sort
o
folk
are
gaun
to
pairtake
wi
him
at
his
table
ye
see
errington
ye
should
ha
thought
a
wee
before
inviting
pairsons
o
unsettled
an
dootful
chairacter
who
says
they
are
demanded
errington
the
drunken
dyceworthy
he
was
no
sae
drunk
at
the
time
he
tauld
us
persisted
macfarlane
in
his
most
obstinate
most
dictatorial
manner
ye
see
it
just
this
way
ah
interrupted
duprèz
briskly
our
dear
sandy
is
an
excellent
talker
but
he
is
a
little
slow
thus
it
is
errington
this
gentleman
named
güldmar
had
a
most
lovely
wife
a
mysterious
lady
with
an
evident
secret
the
beautiful
one
was
never
seen
in
the
church
or
in
any
town
or
village
she
was
met
sometimes
on
hills
by
rivers
in
valleys
carrying
her
child
in
her
arms
the
people
grew
afraid
of
her
but
now
see
what
happens
suddenly
she
appears
no
more
some
one
ventures
to
ask
this
monsieur
güldmar
has
become
of
madame
his
answer
is
brief
is
dead
satisfactory
so
far
yet
not
quite
for
madame
being
dead
then
what
has
become
of
the
corpse
of
madame
it
was
never
seen
no
coffin
was
ever
ordered
and
apparently
it
was
never
buried
what
follows
the
good
people
of
bosekop
draw
the
only
conclusion
possible
monsieur
güldmar
who
is
said
to
have
a
terrific
temper
killed
madame
and
made
away
with
her
body
and
duprèz
waved
his
hand
with
an
air
of
entire
satisfaction
errington
brow
grew
sombre
this
is
the
story
is
it
he
asked
at
last
it
is
enough
is
it
not
laughed
duprèz
but
after
all
what
matter
it
will
be
novel
to
dine
with
a
mur
stop
said
philip
fiercely
with
so
much
authority
that
the
sparkling
pierre
was
startled
call
no
man
by
such
a
name
till
you
know
he
deserves
it
if
güldmar
was
suspected
as
you
say
why
did
somebody
arrest
him
on
the
charge
because
ye
see
replied
macfarlane
there
was
not
sufficient
proof
to
warrant
such
a
proceeding
moreover
the
actual
meenister
of
the
parish
declared
it
was
a
richt
an
said
this
güldmar
was
a
mon
o
vera
queer
notions
an
maybe
had
buried
his
wife
wi
certain
ceremonies
peculiar
to
himself
what
wrong
wi
ye
now
for
a
light
had
flashed
on
errington
mind
and
with
the
quick
comprehension
it
gave
him
his
countenance
cleared
he
laughed
that
very
likely
he
said
güldmar
is
a
character
he
follows
the
faith
of
odin
and
not
even
dyceworthy
can
convert
him
to
christianity
macfarlane
stared
with
a
sort
of
stupefied
solemnity
mon
he
exclaimed
ye
never
mean
to
say
there
an
actual
puir
human
creature
that
in
this
blessed
enlightened
nineteenth
century
of
ours
is
so
far
misguidit
as
to
worship
the
fearfu
gods
o
the
scandinavian
meethology
ah
yawned
lorimer
you
may
wonder
away
sandy
but
it
true
enough
old
güldmar
is
an
odinite
in
this
blessed
enlightened
nineteenth
century
of
ours
when
christians
amuse
themselves
by
despising
and
condemning
each
other
and
thus
upsetting
all
the
precepts
of
the
master
they
profess
to
follow
there
is
actually
a
man
who
sticks
to
the
traditions
of
his
ancestors
odd
is
it
in
this
delightful
intellectual
age
when
more
than
half
of
us
are
discontented
with
life
and
yet
do
want
to
die
there
is
a
fine
old
gentleman
living
beyond
the
arctic
circle
who
is
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
existence
not
only
that
he
thinks
death
the
greatest
glory
that
can
befall
him
comfortable
state
of
things
altogether
i
half
inclined
to
be
an
odinite
too
sandy
still
remained
lost
in
astonishment
then
ye
do
believe
that
he
made
awa
wi
his
wife
he
inquired
slowly
not
in
the
least
returned
lorimer
decidedly
neither
will
you
when
you
see
him
he
a
great
deal
better
up
in
literature
than
you
are
my
boy
i
swear
judging
from
the
books
he
has
and
when
he
mentioned
his
wife
as
he
did
once
you
could
see
in
his
face
he
had
never
done
any
harm
besides
his
daughter
ah
but
i
forgot
interposed
duprèz
again
the
daughter
thelma
was
the
child
the
mysteriously
vanished
lady
carried
in
her
arms
wandering
with
it
all
about
the
woods
and
hills
after
her
disappearance
another
thing
extraordinary
happens
the
child
also
disappears
and
monsieur
güldmar
lives
alone
avoided
carefully
by
every
respectable
person
suddenly
the
child
returns
grown
to
be
nearly
a
woman
and
they
say
lovely
to
an
almost
impossible
extreme
she
lives
with
her
father
she
like
her
strange
mother
never
enters
a
church
town
or
village
nowhere
in
fact
where
persons
are
in
any
numbers
three
years
ago
it
appears
she
vanished
again
but
came
back
at
the
end
of
ten
months
lovelier
than
ever
since
then
she
has
remained
quiet
composed
but
always
apart
she
may
disappear
at
any
moment
droll
is
it
not
errington
and
the
reputation
she
has
is
natural
pray
state
it
said
philip
with
freezing
coldness
the
reputation
of
a
woman
is
nothing
nowadays
fair
game
go
on
but
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
blazed
dangerously
almost
unconsciously
his
hand
toyed
with
the
rose
thelma
had
given
him
that
still
ornamented
his
mon
dieu
cried
duprèz
in
amazement
but
look
not
at
me
like
that
it
seems
to
displease
you
to
put
you
what
i
say
it
is
not
my
story
it
is
not
i
i
know
not
mademoiselle
güldmar
but
as
her
beauty
is
considered
superhuman
they
say
it
is
the
devil
who
is
her
her
and
who
sees
after
her
complexion
in
brief
she
is
thought
to
be
a
witch
in
full
practice
dangerous
to
life
and
limb
errington
laughed
loudly
he
was
so
much
relieved
is
that
all
he
said
with
light
contempt
by
jove
what
a
pack
of
fools
there
must
be
about
here
ugly
fools
too
if
they
think
beauty
is
a
sign
of
witchcraft
i
wonder
dyceworthy
is
scared
out
of
his
skin
if
he
positively
thinks
the
witch
is
setting
her
cap
at
him
ah
but
he
means
to
convairt
her
said
macfarlane
seriously
to
draw
the
evil
oot
o
her
as
it
were
he
said
he
wad
by
fair
means
or
foul
something
in
these
latter
words
struck
lorimer
for
raising
himself
in
his
seat
he
asked
surely
dyceworthy
with
all
his
stupidity
does
carry
it
so
far
as
to
believe
in
witchcraft
oh
indeed
he
does
exclaimed
duprèz
he
believes
in
it
la
he
has
bible
authority
for
his
belief
he
is
very
firm
firmest
when
drunk
and
he
laughed
gaily
errington
muttered
something
not
very
flattering
to
intelligence
which
escaped
the
hearing
of
his
friends
then
he
said
come
along
all
of
you
down
into
the
saloon
we
want
something
to
eat
let
the
güldmars
alone
i
not
a
bit
sorry
i
asked
them
to
come
i
believe
you
all
like
them
immensely
they
all
descended
the
leading
to
the
lower
part
of
the
yacht
and
macfarlane
asked
as
he
followed
his
host
is
the
lass
vera
bonnie
did
ye
say
bonnie
not
the
word
for
it
this
time
said
lorimer
coolly
answering
instead
of
errington
miss
güldmar
is
a
magnificent
woman
you
never
saw
such
a
one
sandy
my
boy
she
make
you
sing
small
with
one
look
she
wither
you
up
into
a
kippered
herring
and
as
for
you
duprèz
and
he
regarded
the
little
frenchman
critically
let
me
see
you
possibly
reach
up
to
her
shoulder
certainly
not
beyond
it
possible
cried
duprèz
mademoiselle
is
a
giantess
she
need
be
a
giantess
to
overtop
you
laughed
lorimer
with
a
lazy
shrug
by
jove
i
sleepy
errington
old
boy
are
we
never
going
to
bed
it
no
good
waiting
till
it
dark
here
you
know
have
something
first
said
sir
philip
seating
himself
at
the
saloon
table
where
his
steward
had
laid
out
a
tasty
cold
collation
we
had
a
good
deal
of
climbing
about
and
rowing
it
taken
it
out
of
us
a
little
thus
hospitably
adjured
they
took
their
places
and
managed
to
dispose
of
an
excellent
supper
the
meal
concluded
duprèz
helped
himself
to
a
tiny
liqueur
glass
of
chartreuse
as
a
to
the
exertions
of
the
day
a
mild
luxury
in
which
the
others
joined
him
with
the
exception
of
macfarlane
who
was
wont
to
declare
that
a
mon
without
his
whusky
was
nae
mon
at
a
and
who
therefore
persisted
in
burning
up
his
interior
mechanism
with
alcohol
in
spite
of
the
doctrines
of
hygiene
and
was
now
absorbed
in
the
work
of
mixing
his
lemon
sugar
hot
water
and
poison
his
usual
preparation
for
a
night
rest
lorimer
usually
conversational
watched
him
in
abstracted
silence
rallied
on
this
morose
humor
he
rose
shook
himself
like
a
retriever
yawned
and
sauntered
to
the
piano
that
occupied
a
dim
corner
of
the
saloon
and
began
to
play
with
that
delicate
subtle
touch
which
though
it
does
not
always
mark
the
brilliant
pianist
distinguishes
the
true
lover
of
music
to
whose
ears
a
rough
thump
on
the
instrument
or
a
false
note
would
be
most
exquisite
agony
lorimer
had
no
pretense
to
musical
talent
asked
he
confessed
he
could
strum
a
little
and
he
seemed
to
see
the
evident
wonder
and
admiration
he
awakened
in
the
minds
of
many
to
whom
such
strumming
as
his
was
infinitely
more
delightful
than
more
practiced
finished
playing
just
now
he
seemed
undecided
he
commenced
a
dainty
little
prelude
of
chopin
then
broke
suddenly
off
and
wandered
into
another
strain
wild
pleading
pitiful
and
passionate
a
melody
so
weird
and
dreamy
that
even
the
stolid
macfarlane
paused
in
his
and
duprèz
looked
round
in
some
wonderment
beau
ça
he
murmured
errington
said
nothing
he
recognized
the
tune
as
that
which
thelma
had
sung
at
her
and
his
bold
bright
eyes
grew
pensive
and
soft
as
the
picture
of
the
fair
face
and
form
rose
up
again
before
his
mind
absorbed
in
a
reverie
he
almost
started
when
lorimer
ceased
playing
and
said
lightly
boys
i
off
to
bed
phil
do
wake
me
so
abominably
early
as
you
did
this
morning
if
you
do
friendship
can
hold
out
no
longer
we
must
part
all
right
laughed
errington
watching
his
friend
as
he
sauntered
out
of
the
saloon
then
seeing
duprèz
and
macfarlane
rise
from
the
table
he
added
courteously
do
hurry
away
on
lorimer
account
you
two
i
not
in
the
least
sleepy
i
sit
up
with
you
to
any
hour
it
is
droll
to
go
to
bed
in
broad
daylight
said
duprèz
but
it
must
be
done
your
eyes
are
heavy
bed
to
bed
as
the
excellent
madame
macbeth
says
ah
femme
what
an
exciting
wife
she
was
for
a
man
come
let
us
follow
our
dear
lorimer
his
music
was
delicious
good
night
or
good
morning
i
know
not
which
it
is
in
this
strange
land
where
the
sun
shines
always
it
is
confusing
they
shook
hands
and
separated
errington
however
unable
to
compose
his
mind
to
rest
went
into
his
cabin
merely
to
come
out
of
it
again
and
betake
himself
to
the
deck
where
he
decided
to
walk
up
and
down
till
he
felt
sleepy
he
wished
to
be
alone
with
his
own
thoughts
for
awhile
to
try
and
resolve
the
meaning
of
this
strange
new
emotion
that
possessed
him
a
feeling
that
was
half
pleasing
half
painful
and
that
certainly
moved
him
to
a
sort
of
shame
a
man
if
he
be
strong
and
healthy
is
always
more
or
less
ashamed
when
love
with
a
single
effort
proves
him
to
be
weaker
than
a
blade
of
grass
swaying
in
the
wind
what
all
his
dignity
all
his
resoluteness
all
his
authority
swept
down
by
the
light
touch
of
a
mere
willow
wand
for
the
very
sake
of
his
own
manhood
and
he
can
not
help
but
be
ashamed
it
is
as
though
a
little
nude
laughing
child
mocked
at
a
lion
strength
and
made
him
a
helpless
prisoner
with
a
fragile
daisy
chain
so
the
god
eros
begins
his
battles
which
end
in
perpetual
victory
first
fear
and
shame
then
desire
and
passion
then
conquest
and
possession
and
afterwards
ah
afterwards
the
pagan
deity
is
powerless
a
higher
god
a
grander
force
a
nobler
creed
must
carry
love
to
its
supreme
and
best
fulfillment

rendu
fou
victor
hugo
it
was
half
an
hour
past
midnight
sir
philip
was
left
in
absolute
solitude
to
enjoy
his
meditative
stroll
on
deck
for
the
full
radiance
of
light
that
streamed
over
the
sea
and
land
was
too
clear
and
brilliant
to
necessitate
the
attendance
of
any
of
the
sailors
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
the
she
was
safely
anchored
and
distinctly
visible
to
all
boats
or
fishing
craft
crossing
the
fjord
so
that
unless
a
sudden
gale
should
blow
which
did
not
seem
probable
in
the
present
state
of
the
weather
there
was
nothing
for
the
men
to
do
that
need
deprive
them
of
their
lawful
repose
errington
paced
up
and
down
slowly
his
yachting
shoes
making
no
noise
even
as
they
left
no
scratch
on
the
spotless
white
deck
that
shone
in
the
night
sunshine
like
polished
silver
the
fjord
was
very
calm
on
one
side
it
gleamed
like
a
pool
of
golden
oil
in
which
the
outline
of
the
was
precisely
traced
her
delicate
masts
and
spars
and
drooping
flag
being
drawn
in
black
lines
on
the
yellow
water
as
though
with
a
finely
pointed
pencil
there
was
a
curious
light
in
the
western
sky
a
thick
bank
of
clouds
dusky
brown
in
color
were
swept
together
and
piled
one
above
the
other
in
mountainous
ridges
that
rose
up
perpendicularly
from
the
very
edge
of
the
while
over
their
dark
summits
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
like
a
giant
eye
looked
forth
darting
dazzling
descending
rays
through
the
sullen
masses
tinging
them
with
metallic
green
and
copper
hues
as
brilliant
and
shifting
as
the
bristling
points
of
lifted
spears
away
to
the
south
a
solitary
wreath
of
purple
vapor
floated
slowly
as
though
lost
from
some
great
mountain
height
and
through
its
faint
half
disguising
veil
the
pale
moon
peered
sorrowfully
like
a
dying
prisoner
lamenting
joy
long
past
but
unforgotten
a
solemn
silence
reigned
and
errington
watching
sea
and
sky
grew
more
and
more
absorbed
and
serious
the
scornful
words
of
the
proud
old
olaf
güldmar
rankled
in
his
mind
and
stung
him
an
idle
trifler
with
time
an
aimless
wanderer
bitter
but
after
all
true
he
looked
back
on
his
life
with
a
feeling
kin
to
contempt
what
had
he
done
that
was
at
all
worth
doing
he
had
seen
to
the
proper
management
of
his
estates
well
any
one
with
a
grain
of
and
love
of
independence
would
do
the
same
he
had
travelled
and
amused
himself
he
had
studied
languages
and
literature
he
had
made
many
friends
but
after
all
said
and
done
the
cutting
observations
had
described
him
correctly
enough
the
tendency
common
to
the
very
wealthy
in
this
age
had
crept
upon
him
unconsciously
the
easy
cool
indifferent
nonchalance
common
to
men
of
his
class
and
breeding
was
habitual
with
him
and
he
had
never
thought
it
worth
while
to
exert
his
dormant
abilities
why
then
should
he
now
begin
to
think
it
was
time
to
reform
all
this
to
rouse
himself
to
an
effort
to
gain
for
himself
some
honor
some
distinction
some
renown
that
should
mark
him
out
as
different
to
other
men
why
was
he
suddenly
seized
with
an
insatiate
desire
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
mushroom
knight
a
fungus
of
nobility
why
if
not
to
make
himself
worthy
of
ah
there
he
had
struck
a
suggestive
worthy
of
what
of
whom
there
was
no
one
in
all
the
world
excepting
perhaps
lorimer
who
cared
what
became
of
sir
philip
errington
baronet
in
the
future
so
long
as
he
would
for
the
present
entertain
and
feast
his
numerous
acquaintances
and
give
them
all
the
advantages
social
and
political
his
wealth
could
so
easily
obtain
then
why
in
the
name
of
indolence
should
he
muse
with
such
persistent
gloom
on
his
general
unworthiness
at
this
particular
moment
was
it
because
this
norwegian
maiden
grand
blue
eyes
had
met
his
with
such
beautiful
trust
and
candor
he
had
known
many
women
queens
of
society
titled
beauties
brilliant
actresses
sirens
of
the
world
with
all
their
witcheries
in
full
play
and
he
had
never
lost
his
or
his
heart
with
the
loveliest
of
them
he
had
always
felt
himself
master
of
the
situation
knowing
that
in
their
opinion
he
was
always
a
catch
an
eligible
and
therefore
well
worth
winning
now
for
the
first
time
he
became
aware
of
his
utter
insignificance
this
tall
fair
goddess
knew
none
of
the
social
slang
and
her
fair
pure
face
the
mirror
of
a
fair
pure
soul
showed
that
the
eligibility
of
a
man
from
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
was
a
consideration
that
would
never
present
itself
to
her
mind
what
she
would
look
at
would
be
the
man
himself
not
his
pocket
and
studied
from
such
an
exceptional
height
a
height
seldom
climbed
by
modern
marrying
women
philip
felt
himself
unworthy
it
was
a
good
sign
there
are
great
hopes
of
any
man
who
is
honestly
dissatisfied
with
himself
folding
his
arms
he
leaned
idly
on
the
and
looked
gravely
and
musingly
down
into
the
motionless
water
where
the
varied
lines
of
the
sky
were
clearly
mirrored
when
a
slight
creaking
cracking
sound
was
heard
as
of
some
obstacle
grazing
against
or
bumping
the
side
of
the
yacht
he
looked
and
saw
to
his
surprise
a
small
rowing
boat
close
under
the
gunwale
so
close
indeed
that
the
slow
motion
of
the
tide
heaved
it
every
now
and
then
into
a
jerky
collision
with
the
lower
framework
of
the
a
circumstance
which
explained
the
sound
which
had
attracted
his
attention
the
boat
was
not
unoccupied
there
was
some
one
in
it
lying
straight
across
the
seats
with
face
turned
upwards
to
the
sky
and
walking
noiselessly
to
a
better
post
of
observation
errington
heart
beat
with
some
excitement
as
he
recognized
the
long
fair
unkempt
locks
and
eccentric
attire
of
the
strange
personage
who
had
confronted
him
in
the
cave
the
crazy
little
man
who
had
called
himself
sigurd
there
he
was
beyond
a
doubt
lying
flat
on
his
back
with
his
eyes
closed
asleep
or
dead
he
might
have
been
the
latter
his
thin
face
was
so
pale
and
drawn
his
lips
were
so
set
and
colorless
errington
astonished
to
see
him
there
called
softly
sigurd
sigurd
there
was
no
answer
sigurd
form
seemed
inanimate
his
eyes
remained
fast
shut
is
he
in
a
trance
thought
sir
philip
wonderingly
or
has
he
fainted
from
some
physical
exhaustion
he
called
again
but
again
received
no
reply
he
now
observed
in
the
stem
of
the
boat
a
large
bunch
of
pansies
dark
as
velvet
and
evidently
freshly
gathered
proving
that
sigurd
had
been
wandering
in
the
deep
valleys
and
on
the
sloping
sides
of
the
hills
where
these
flowers
may
be
frequently
found
in
norway
during
the
summer
he
began
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
as
he
watched
that
straight
stiff
figure
in
the
boat
and
was
just
about
to
swing
down
the
for
the
purpose
of
closer
inspection
when
a
glorious
burst
of
light
streamed
radiantly
over
the
fjord
the
sun
conquered
the
masses
of
dark
cloud
that
had
striven
to
conceal
his
beauty
and
now
like
a
warrior
clad
in
golden
armor
surmounted
and
trod
down
his
enemies
shining
forth
in
all
his
splendor
with
that
rush
of
brilliant
effulgence
the
apparently
lifeless
sigurd
stirred
he
opened
his
eyes
and
as
they
were
turned
upwards
he
naturally
from
his
close
vicinity
to
the
side
of
the
met
errington
gaze
fixed
inquiringly
and
somewhat
anxiously
upon
him
he
sprang
up
with
such
sudden
and
fierce
haste
that
his
frail
boat
rocked
dangerously
and
philip
involuntarily
cried
out
take
care
sigurd
stood
upright
in
his
swaying
skiff
and
laughed
scornfully
take
care
he
echoed
derisively
it
is
you
who
should
take
care
you
poor
miserable
moth
on
the
edge
of
a
mad
storm
it
is
you
to
fear
not
i
see
how
the
light
rains
over
the
broad
sky
all
for
me
yes
all
the
light
all
the
glory
for
me
all
the
darkness
all
the
shame
for
you
errington
listened
to
these
ravings
with
an
air
of
patience
and
pitying
gentleness
then
he
said
with
perfect
coolness
you
are
quite
right
sigurd
you
are
always
right
i
am
sure
come
up
here
and
see
me
i
wo
hurt
you
come
along
the
friendly
tone
and
gentle
manner
appeared
to
soothe
the
unhappy
dwarf
for
he
stared
doubtfully
then
smiled
and
finally
as
though
acting
under
a
spell
he
took
up
an
oar
and
propelled
himself
skillfully
enough
to
the
gangway
where
errington
let
down
the
ladder
and
with
his
own
hand
assisted
his
visitor
to
mount
not
forgetting
to
fasten
the
boat
safely
to
the
steps
as
he
did
so
once
on
deck
sigurd
gazed
about
him
perplexedly
he
had
brought
his
bunch
of
pansies
with
him
and
he
fingered
their
soft
leaves
thoughtfully
suddenly
his
eyes
flashed
you
are
alone
here
he
asked
abruptly
fearing
to
scare
his
strange
guest
by
the
mention
of
his
companions
errington
answered
simply
yes
quite
alone
just
now
sigurd
sigurd
took
a
step
closer
towards
him
are
you
not
afraid
he
said
in
an
solemn
voice
sir
philip
smiled
i
never
was
afraid
of
anything
in
my
life
he
answered
the
dwarf
eyed
him
keenly
you
are
not
afraid
he
went
on
that
i
shall
kill
you
not
in
the
least
returned
errington
calmly
you
would
not
do
anything
so
foolish
my
friend
sigurd
laughed
ha
ha
you
call
me
you
think
that
word
a
safeguard
i
tell
you
no
there
are
no
friends
now
the
world
is
a
great
field
of
battle
each
man
fights
the
other
there
is
no
peace
none
anywhere
the
wind
fights
with
the
forests
you
can
hear
them
slashing
and
slaying
all
night
long
when
it
night
the
long
long
night
the
sun
fights
with
the
sky
the
light
with
the
dark
and
life
with
death
it
is
all
a
bitter
quarrel
none
are
satisfied
none
shall
know
friendship
any
more
it
is
too
late
we
can
not
be
friends
well
have
it
your
own
way
said
philip
wishing
that
lorimer
were
awake
to
interview
this
strange
specimen
of
human
wit
gone
astray
we
fight
if
you
like
anything
to
please
you
we
fighting
said
sigurd
with
intense
passion
in
his
voice
you
may
not
know
it
but
i
know
it
i
have
felt
the
thrust
of
your
sword
it
has
crossed
mine
stay
and
his
eyes
grew
vague
and
dreamy
why
was
i
sent
to
seek
you
out
let
me
think
let
me
think
and
he
seated
himself
forlornly
on
one
of
the
deck
chairs
and
seemed
painfully
endeavoring
to
put
his
scattered
ideas
in
order
errington
studied
him
with
a
gentle
forbearance
inwardly
he
was
very
curious
to
know
whether
this
sigurd
had
any
connection
with
the
güldmars
but
he
refrained
from
asking
too
many
questions
he
simply
said
in
a
cheery
tone
yes
sigurd
why
did
you
come
to
see
me
i
glad
you
did
it
very
kind
of
you
but
i
do
think
you
even
know
my
name
to
his
surprise
sigurd
looked
up
with
a
more
settled
and
resolved
expression
of
face
and
answered
almost
as
connectedly
as
any
sane
man
could
have
done
i
know
your
name
very
well
he
said
in
a
low
composed
manner
you
are
sir
philip
errington
a
rich
english
nobleman
fate
led
you
to
grave
a
grave
that
no
strange
feet
have
ever
passed
save
yours
and
so
i
know
you
are
the
man
for
whom
her
spirit
has
waited
she
has
brought
you
hither
how
foolish
to
think
she
sleeps
under
the
stone
when
she
is
always
awake
and
busy
always
at
work
opposing
me
yes
though
i
pray
her
to
lie
still
she
will
not
his
voice
grew
wild
again
and
philip
asked
quietly
of
whom
are
you
speaking
sigurd
his
steady
tone
seemed
to
have
some
compelling
influence
on
the
confused
mind
of
the
creature
who
answered
readily
and
at
once
of
whom
should
i
speak
but
thelma
thelma
the
beautiful
rose
of
the
northern
forest
thelma
he
broke
off
abruptly
with
a
long
shuddering
sigh
and
rocking
himself
drearily
to
and
fro
gazed
wistfully
out
to
the
sea
errington
hazarded
a
guess
as
to
the
purpose
of
that
coffin
hidden
in
the
shell
cavern
do
you
mean
thelma
living
or
thelma
dead
both
answered
sigurd
promptly
they
are
one
and
the
same
you
can
not
part
them
mother
and
child
rose
and
rosebud
one
walks
the
earth
with
the
step
of
a
queen
the
other
floats
in
the
air
like
a
silvery
cloud
but
i
see
them
join
and
embrace
and
melt
into
each
other
arms
till
they
unite
in
one
form
fairer
than
the
beauty
of
angels
and
you
you
know
this
as
well
as
i
do
you
have
seen
thelma
you
have
kissed
the
cup
of
friendship
with
her
but
remember
not
with
me
not
with
me
he
started
from
his
seat
and
running
close
up
to
errington
laid
one
meagre
hand
on
his
chest
how
strong
you
are
how
broad
and
brave
he
exclaimed
with
a
sort
of
childish
admiration
and
can
you
not
be
generous
too
errington
looked
down
upon
him
compassionately
he
had
learned
enough
from
his
incoherent
talk
to
clear
up
what
had
seemed
a
mystery
the
scandalous
reports
concerning
olaf
güldmar
were
incorrect
he
had
evidently
laid
the
remains
of
his
wife
in
the
for
some
reason
connected
with
his
religious
belief
and
thelma
visits
to
the
sacred
spot
were
now
easy
of
comprehension
no
doubt
it
was
she
who
placed
fresh
flowers
there
every
day
and
kept
the
little
lamp
burning
before
the
crucifix
as
a
sign
of
the
faith
her
departed
mother
had
professed
and
which
she
herself
followed
but
who
was
sigurd
and
what
was
he
to
the
güldmars
thinking
this
he
replied
to
the
question
by
a
how
shall
i
be
generous
sigurd
tell
me
what
can
i
do
to
please
you
sigurd
wild
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
do
he
cried
you
can
go
away
swiftly
swiftly
over
the
seas
and
the
altenfjord
need
know
you
no
more
spread
your
white
sails
and
he
pointed
excitedly
up
to
the
tall
tapering
masts
of
the
you
are
king
here
command
and
you
are
obeyed
go
from
us
go
what
is
there
here
to
delay
you
our
mountains
are
dark
and
gloomy
the
fields
are
wild
and
desolate
there
are
rocks
glaciers
and
shrieking
torrents
that
hiss
like
serpents
gliding
into
the
sea
oh
there
must
be
fairer
lands
than
this
one
lands
where
oceans
and
sky
are
like
twin
jewels
set
in
one
ring
where
there
are
sweet
flowers
and
fruits
and
bright
eyes
to
smile
on
you
all
day
yes
for
you
are
as
a
god
in
your
strength
and
beauty
no
woman
will
be
cruel
to
ah
say
you
will
go
away
and
sigurd
face
was
transfigured
into
a
sort
of
pained
beauty
as
he
made
his
appeal
that
is
what
i
came
to
seek
you
for
to
ask
you
to
set
sail
quickly
and
go
for
why
should
you
wish
to
destroy
me
i
have
done
you
no
harm
as
yet
go
and
odin
himself
shall
follow
your
path
with
blessings
he
paused
almost
breathless
with
his
own
earnest
pleading
errington
was
silent
he
considered
the
request
a
mere
proof
of
the
poor
creature
disorder
the
very
idea
that
sigurd
seemed
to
entertain
of
his
doing
him
any
harm
showed
a
reasonless
terror
and
foreboding
that
was
simply
to
be
set
down
as
caused
by
his
unfortunate
mental
condition
to
such
an
appeal
there
could
be
no
satisfactory
reply
to
sail
away
from
the
altenfjord
and
its
now
most
fascinating
attractions
because
a
madman
asked
him
to
do
so
was
a
proposition
impossible
of
acceptance
so
sir
philip
said
nothing
sigurd
however
watching
his
face
intently
saw
or
thought
he
saw
a
look
of
resolution
in
the
englishman
clear
deep
grey
eyes
and
with
the
startling
quickness
common
to
many
whose
brains
like
musical
instruments
are
jarred
yet
not
quite
unstrung
he
grasped
the
meaning
of
that
expression
instantly
ah
cruel
and
traitorous
he
exclaimed
fiercely
you
will
not
go
you
are
resolved
to
tear
my
heart
out
for
your
sport
i
have
pleaded
with
you
as
one
pleads
with
a
king
and
all
in
vain
all
in
vain
you
will
not
go
listen
see
what
you
will
do
and
he
held
up
the
bunch
of
purple
pansies
while
his
voice
sank
to
an
almost
feeble
faintness
look
and
he
fingered
the
flowers
look
they
are
dark
and
soft
as
a
purple
sky
cool
and
dewy
and
fresh
they
are
the
thoughts
of
thelma
such
thoughts
so
wise
and
earnest
so
pure
and
full
of
tender
shadows
no
hand
has
grasped
them
rudely
no
rough
touch
has
spoiled
their
smoothness
they
open
to
the
sky
they
never
droop
or
languish
they
have
no
secrets
save
the
marvel
of
their
beauty
now
you
have
come
you
will
have
no
pity
one
by
one
you
will
gather
and
play
with
her
thoughts
as
though
they
were
these
blossoms
your
burning
hand
will
mar
their
color
they
will
wither
and
furl
up
and
die
all
of
them
and
you
what
will
you
care
nothing
no
man
ever
cares
for
a
flower
that
is
withered
not
even
though
his
own
hand
slew
it
the
intense
melancholy
that
vibrated
through
sigurd
voice
touched
his
listener
profoundly
dimly
he
guessed
that
the
stricken
soul
before
him
had
formed
the
erroneous
idea
that
he
errington
had
come
to
do
some
great
wrong
to
thelma
or
her
belongings
and
he
pitied
the
poor
creature
for
his
foolish
listen
to
me
sigurd
he
said
with
a
certain
imperativeness
i
can
not
promise
you
to
go
away
but
i
can
promise
that
i
will
do
no
harm
to
you
or
to
to
thelma
will
that
content
you
sigurd
smiled
vacantly
and
shook
his
head
he
looked
at
the
pansies
wistfully
and
laid
them
down
very
gently
on
one
of
the
deck
benches
i
must
go
he
said
in
a
faint
voice
she
is
calling
me
who
is
calling
you
demanded
errington
astonished
she
is
persisted
sigurd
walking
steadily
to
the
gangway
i
can
hear
her
there
are
the
roses
to
water
and
the
doves
to
feed
and
many
other
things
he
looked
steadily
at
sir
philip
who
seeing
he
was
bent
on
departure
assisted
him
to
descend
the
companion
ladder
into
his
little
boat
you
are
sure
you
will
not
sail
away
errington
balanced
himself
lightly
on
the
ladder
and
smiled
i
am
sure
sigurd
i
have
no
wish
to
sail
away
are
you
all
right
there
he
spoke
cheerily
feeling
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
scarcely
safe
for
a
madman
to
be
quite
alone
in
a
of
a
boat
on
a
deep
fjord
the
shores
of
which
were
indented
with
dangerous
rocks
as
sharp
as
the
bristling
teeth
of
fabled
but
sigurd
answered
him
almost
contemptuously
all
right
he
echoed
that
is
what
the
english
say
always
all
right
as
if
it
were
ever
wrong
with
me
and
the
sea
we
know
each
other
we
do
each
other
no
harm
may
die
on
the
sea
but
shall
not
no
there
is
another
way
to
valhalla
oh
i
dare
say
there
are
no
end
of
ways
said
errington
still
poising
himself
on
the
ladder
and
holding
on
to
the
side
of
his
yacht
as
he
watched
his
late
visitor
take
the
oars
and
move
off
sigurd
take
care
of
yourself
hope
i
shall
see
you
again
soon
but
sigurd
replied
not
bending
to
the
oars
he
rowed
swiftly
and
strongly
and
sir
philip
pulling
up
the
ladder
and
closing
the
gangway
saw
the
little
skiff
flying
over
the
water
like
a
bird
in
the
direction
of
the
güldmar
he
wondered
again
and
again
what
relationship
if
any
this
being
bore
to
the
and
his
daughter
that
he
knew
all
about
them
was
pretty
evident
but
how
catching
sight
of
the
pansies
left
on
the
deck
bench
errington
took
them
and
descending
to
the
saloon
set
them
on
the
table
in
a
tumbler
of
water
thelma
thoughts
the
poor
little
fellow
called
them
he
mused
with
a
smile
a
pretty
fancy
of
his
and
linked
with
the
crazy
imaginings
of
ophelia
too
pansies
that
for
thoughts
said
but
sigurd
idea
is
different
he
believes
they
are
thelma
own
thoughts
in
flower
rough
touch
has
spoiled
their
smoothness
he
declared
he
right
there
i
sure
and
shall
i
ruffle
the
sweet
leaves
shall
i
crush
the
tender
petals
or
shall
i
simply
transform
them
from
pansies
into
roses
from
the
dream
of
love
into
love
itself
his
eyes
softened
as
he
glanced
at
the
drooping
rose
he
wore
which
thelma
herself
had
given
him
and
as
he
went
to
his
sleeping
cabin
he
carefully
detached
it
from
his
and
taking
down
a
book
one
which
he
greatly
prized
because
it
had
belonged
to
his
mother
he
prepared
to
press
the
flower
within
its
leaves
it
was
the
imitation
of
christ
bound
quaintly
and
fastened
with
silver
clasps
and
as
he
was
about
to
lay
his
fragrant
trophy
on
the
first
page
that
opened
naturally
of
itself
he
glanced
at
the
words
that
there
presented
themselves
to
his
eyes
nothing
is
sweeter
than
love
nothing
stronger
nothing
higher
nothing
wider
nothing
more
pleasant
nothing
fuller
or
better
in
heaven
or
in
earth
and
with
a
smile
and
a
warmer
flush
of
color
than
usual
on
his
handsome
face
he
touched
the
rose
lightly
yet
tenderly
with
his
lips
and
shut
it
reverently
within
its
sacred
chapter
ix
our
manners
are
infinitely
corrupted
and
wonderfully
incline
to
the
worse
of
our
customs
there
are
many
barbarous
and
monstrous
montaigne
the
next
day
was
very
warm
and
bright
and
that
pious
lutheran
divine
the
reverend
charles
dyceworthy
was
seriously
encumbered
by
his
own
surplus
flesh
material
as
he
wearily
rowed
himself
across
the
fjord
towards
olaf
güldmar
private
pier
as
the
perspiration
bedewed
his
brow
he
felt
that
heaven
had
dealt
with
him
somewhat
too
liberally
in
the
way
of
fat
he
was
provided
too
amply
with
it
ever
to
excel
as
an
oarsman
the
sun
was
burning
hot
the
water
was
smooth
as
oil
and
very
weighty
it
seemed
to
resist
every
stroke
of
his
clumsily
wielded
blades
altogether
it
was
hard
uncongenial
work
and
being
rendered
somewhat
flabby
and
nerveless
by
his
previous
evening
carouse
with
macfarlane
whisky
dyceworthy
was
in
a
plaintive
and
injured
frame
of
mind
he
was
bound
on
a
mission
a
holy
and
edifying
errand
which
would
have
elevated
any
minister
of
his
particular
sect
he
had
found
a
crucifix
with
the
name
of
thelma
engraved
thereon
he
was
now
about
to
return
it
to
the
evident
rightful
owner
and
in
returning
it
he
purposed
denouncing
it
as
an
emblem
of
the
scarlet
woman
that
sitteth
on
the
seven
hills
and
threatening
all
those
who
dared
to
hold
it
sacred
as
doomed
to
eternal
torture
where
the
worm
dieth
not
he
had
thought
over
all
he
meant
to
say
he
had
planned
several
eloquent
and
rounded
sentences
some
of
which
he
murmured
placidly
to
himself
as
he
propelled
his
slow
boat
along
yea
he
observed
in
a
mild
ye
shall
be
cut
off
root
and
branch
ye
shall
be
scorched
even
as
stubble
and
utterly
destroyed
here
he
paused
and
mopped
his
streaming
forehead
with
his
clean
perfumed
handkerchief
yea
he
resumed
peacefully
the
worshippers
of
idolatrous
images
are
accursèd
they
shall
have
ashes
for
food
and
gall
for
drink
let
them
turn
and
repent
themselves
lest
the
wrath
of
god
consume
them
as
straw
whirled
on
the
wind
repent
or
ye
shall
be
cast
into
everlasting
fire
beauty
shall
avail
not
learning
shall
avail
not
meekness
shall
avail
not
for
the
fire
of
hell
is
a
searching
endless
destroying
here
dyceworthy
by
plunging
one
oar
with
too
much
determination
into
the
watery
depths
caught
a
crab
as
the
saying
is
and
fell
violently
backward
in
a
somewhat
undignified
posture
recovering
himself
slowly
he
looked
about
him
in
a
bewildered
way
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
vacant
solitary
appearance
of
the
fjord
some
object
was
missing
he
realized
what
it
was
immediately
the
english
yacht
was
gone
from
her
point
of
anchorage
dear
me
said
dyceworthy
half
aloud
what
a
very
sudden
departure
i
wonder
now
if
those
young
men
have
gone
for
good
or
whether
they
are
coming
back
again
pleasant
fellows
very
pleasant
flippant
perhaps
but
pleasant
and
he
smiled
benevolently
he
had
no
remembrance
of
what
had
occurred
after
he
had
emptied
young
macfarlane
flask
of
glenlivet
he
had
no
idea
that
he
had
been
almost
carried
from
his
garden
into
his
parlor
and
there
flung
on
the
sofa
and
left
to
sleep
off
the
effects
of
his
strong
tipple
least
of
all
did
he
dream
that
he
had
betrayed
any
of
his
intentions
towards
thelma
güldmar
or
given
his
religious
opinions
with
such
free
and
undisguised
candor
blissfully
ignorant
on
these
points
he
resumed
his
refractory
oars
and
after
nearly
an
hour
of
laborious
effort
succeeded
at
last
in
reaching
his
destination
arrived
at
the
little
pier
he
fastened
up
his
boat
and
with
the
lofty
air
of
a
thoroughly
moral
man
he
walked
deliberately
up
to
the
door
of
the
house
contrary
to
custom
it
was
closed
and
the
place
seemed
strangely
silent
and
deserted
the
afternoon
heat
was
so
great
that
the
were
hushed
and
in
hiding
under
the
cool
green
leaves
the
clambering
roses
round
the
porch
hung
down
their
bright
heads
for
sheer
faintness
and
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
were
the
subdued
of
the
doves
on
the
roof
and
the
soft
trickling
rush
of
a
little
mountain
stream
that
flowed
through
the
grounds
some
what
surprised
though
not
abashed
at
the
evident
look
of
the
dyceworthy
rapped
loudly
at
the
rough
oaken
door
with
his
knuckles
there
being
no
such
modern
convenience
as
a
bell
or
a
knocker
he
waited
sometime
before
he
was
answered
repeating
his
summons
violently
at
frequent
intervals
and
swearing
irreligiously
under
his
breath
as
he
did
so
but
at
last
the
door
was
flung
sharply
open
and
the
britta
confronted
him
with
an
aspect
which
was
by
no
means
encouraging
or
polite
her
round
blue
eyes
sparkled
saucily
and
she
placed
her
bare
plump
red
arms
wet
with
recent
soapsuds
akimbo
on
her
sturdy
little
hips
with
an
air
that
was
decidedly
impertinent
well
what
do
you
want
she
demanded
with
rude
abruptness
dyceworthy
regarded
her
in
speechless
dignity
vouchsafing
no
reply
he
attempted
to
pass
her
and
enter
the
house
but
britta
settled
her
arms
more
defiantly
than
ever
and
her
voice
had
a
sharper
ring
as
she
said
it
no
use
your
coming
in
there
no
one
here
but
me
the
master
has
gone
out
for
the
day
young
woman
returned
dyceworthy
with
polite
severity
i
regret
to
see
that
your
manners
stand
in
sore
need
of
improvement
your
master
absence
is
of
no
importance
to
me
it
is
with
the
fröken
thelma
i
desire
to
speak
britta
laughed
and
tossed
her
rough
brown
curls
back
from
her
forehead
mischievous
dimples
came
and
went
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
indications
of
suppressed
fun
the
fröken
is
out
too
she
said
demurely
it
time
she
had
a
little
amusement
and
the
gentlemen
treat
her
as
if
she
were
a
queen
dyceworthy
started
and
his
red
visage
became
a
trifle
paler
gentlemen
what
gentlemen
he
demanded
with
some
impatience
britta
inward
delight
evidently
increased
the
gentlemen
from
the
yacht
of
course
she
said
what
other
are
there
this
with
a
contemptuous
sort
of
look
at
the
lutheran
minister
portly
form
sir
philip
errington
was
here
with
his
friend
yesterday
evening
and
stayed
a
long
time
and
today
a
fine
boat
with
four
oars
came
to
fetch
the
master
and
fröken
thelma
and
they
are
all
gone
for
a
sail
to
the
kaa
fjord
or
some
other
place
near
here
i
can
not
remember
the
name
and
i
am
so
glad
went
on
britta
clasping
her
plump
hands
in
ecstasy
they
are
the
grandest
handsomest
i
have
ever
seen
and
one
can
tell
they
think
wonders
of
the
fröken
nothing
is
too
good
for
her
dyceworthy
face
was
the
picture
of
dismay
this
was
a
new
turn
to
the
course
of
events
and
one
more
over
that
he
had
never
once
contemplated
britta
watched
him
amusedly
will
you
leave
any
message
for
them
when
they
return
she
asked
no
said
the
minister
dubiously
yet
stay
yes
i
will
tell
the
fröken
that
i
have
found
something
which
belongs
to
her
and
that
when
she
wishes
to
have
it
i
will
myself
bring
it
britta
looked
cross
if
it
is
hers
you
have
no
business
to
keep
it
she
said
brusquely
why
not
leave
it
whatever
it
is
with
me
dyceworthy
regarded
her
with
a
bland
and
lofty
air
i
trust
no
concerns
of
mine
or
hers
to
the
keeping
of
a
paid
domestic
he
said
a
domestic
moreover
who
deserts
the
ways
of
her
own
people
who
hath
dealings
with
the
dwellers
in
darkness
who
even
bringeth
herself
to
forget
much
of
her
own
native
tongue
and
who
devoteth
herself
to
what
he
would
have
said
was
uncertain
as
at
that
moment
he
was
nearly
thrown
down
by
a
something
that
slipped
agilely
between
his
legs
pinching
each
fat
calf
as
it
passed
a
something
that
looked
like
a
ball
but
proved
to
be
a
human
creature
no
other
than
the
crazy
sigurd
who
after
accomplishing
his
uncouth
gambol
successfully
stood
up
shaking
back
his
streaming
fair
locks
and
laughing
wildly
ha
ha
he
exclaimed
that
was
good
that
was
clever
if
i
had
upset
you
now
you
would
have
said
your
prayers
backward
what
are
you
here
for
this
is
no
place
for
you
they
are
all
gone
out
of
it
has
gone
all
the
world
is
empty
there
is
nothing
any
where
but
air
air
air
no
birds
no
flowers
no
trees
no
sunshine
all
gone
with
her
on
the
sparkling
singing
water
and
he
swung
his
arms
round
violently
and
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
minister
face
what
an
ugly
man
your
are
he
exclaimed
with
refreshing
candor
i
think
you
are
uglier
than
i
am
you
are
straight
but
you
are
like
a
load
of
peat
heavy
and
barren
and
fit
to
burn
now
i
i
am
the
crooked
bough
of
a
tree
but
i
have
bright
leaves
where
a
bird
hides
and
sings
all
day
you
you
have
no
song
no
foliage
only
ugly
and
barren
and
fit
to
burn
he
laughed
heartily
and
catching
sight
of
britta
where
she
stood
in
the
doorway
entirely
unconcerned
at
his
eccentric
behavior
he
went
up
to
her
and
took
hold
of
the
corner
of
her
apron
take
me
in
britta
dear
pretty
britta
he
said
coaxingly
sigurd
is
hungry
britta
sweet
little
britta
come
and
talk
to
me
and
sing
fat
man
he
added
suddenly
turning
round
once
more
on
dyceworthy
you
will
never
overtake
the
big
ship
that
has
gone
away
with
thelma
over
the
water
thelma
will
come
back
yes
but
one
day
she
will
go
never
to
come
back
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
last
night
i
saw
a
little
spirit
come
out
of
a
rose
he
carried
a
tiny
golden
hammer
and
nail
and
a
ball
of
cord
like
a
sunbeam
he
flew
away
so
quickly
i
could
not
follow
him
but
i
know
where
he
went
he
fastened
the
nail
in
the
heart
of
thelma
deeply
so
that
the
little
drops
of
blood
flowed
but
she
felt
no
pain
and
then
he
tied
the
golden
cord
to
the
nail
and
left
her
carrying
the
other
end
of
the
string
with
him
to
whom
some
other
heart
must
be
pierced
whose
heart
sigurd
looked
infinitely
cunning
as
well
as
melancholy
and
sighed
deeply
the
reverend
dyceworthy
was
impatient
and
disgusted
it
is
a
pity
he
said
with
an
air
of
solemn
patience
that
this
hapless
creature
accursèd
of
god
and
man
is
not
placed
in
some
proper
abode
suitable
to
the
treatment
of
his
affliction
you
britta
as
the
favored
servant
of
a
a
well
let
us
say
of
a
peculiar
mistress
should
persuade
her
to
send
this
this
person
away
lest
his
vagaries
become
harmful
britta
glanced
very
kindly
at
sigurd
who
still
held
her
apron
with
the
air
of
a
trustful
child
he
no
more
harmful
than
you
are
she
said
promptly
in
answer
to
the
minister
remark
he
a
good
fellow
and
if
he
talks
strangely
he
can
make
himself
useful
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
certain
people
he
can
saw
and
chop
the
wood
make
hay
feed
the
cattle
pull
a
strong
oar
and
sweep
and
keep
the
garden
ca
you
sigurd
she
laid
her
hand
on
sigurd
shoulder
and
he
nodded
his
head
emphatically
as
she
enumerated
his
different
talents
and
as
for
climbing
he
can
guide
you
anywhere
over
the
hills
or
up
the
streams
to
the
big
waterfalls
no
one
better
and
if
you
mean
by
peculiar
that
my
mistress
is
different
to
other
people
why
i
know
she
is
and
am
glad
of
it
at
any
rate
she
a
great
deal
too
to
shut
this
poor
boy
up
in
a
house
for
madmen
he
die
if
he
could
have
the
fresh
air
she
paused
out
of
breath
with
her
rapid
utterance
and
dyceworthy
held
up
his
hands
in
dignified
astonishment
you
talk
too
glibly
young
woman
he
said
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
instruct
you
without
loss
of
time
as
to
how
you
should
be
sparing
of
your
words
in
the
presence
of
your
superiors
and
betters
bang
the
door
was
closed
with
a
decision
that
sent
a
sharp
echo
through
the
silent
heated
air
and
dyceworthy
was
left
to
contemplate
it
at
his
leisure
full
of
wrath
he
was
about
to
knock
peremptorily
and
insist
that
it
should
be
but
on
second
thoughts
he
decided
that
it
was
beneath
his
dignity
to
argue
with
a
servant
much
less
with
a
declared
lunatic
like
sigurd
so
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
his
boat
thinking
gloomily
of
the
hard
labor
awaiting
him
in
the
long
pull
back
to
bosekop
other
thoughts
too
tortured
and
harrassed
his
brain
and
as
he
again
took
the
oars
and
plied
them
wearily
through
the
water
he
was
in
an
exceedingly
unchristian
humor
though
a
specious
hypocrite
he
was
no
fool
he
knew
the
ways
of
men
and
women
and
he
thoroughly
realized
the
present
position
of
affairs
he
was
quite
aware
of
thelma
exceptional
beauty
and
he
felt
pretty
certain
that
no
man
could
look
upon
her
without
admiration
but
up
to
this
time
she
had
been
as
it
were
secluded
from
all
eyes
a
few
haymakers
and
fishermen
were
the
only
persons
of
the
male
sex
who
had
ever
been
within
the
precincts
of
olaf
güldmar
dwelling
with
the
exception
of
himself
dyceworthy
who
being
armed
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
the
actual
minister
of
bosekop
whose
place
he
for
the
present
filled
had
intruded
his
company
frequently
and
persistently
on
the
and
his
daughter
though
he
knew
himself
to
be
entirely
unwelcome
he
had
gathered
together
as
much
as
he
could
all
the
scraps
of
information
concerning
them
how
olaf
güldmar
was
credited
with
having
made
away
with
his
wife
by
foul
means
how
nobody
even
knew
where
his
wife
had
come
from
how
thelma
had
been
mysteriously
educated
and
had
learned
strange
things
concerning
foreign
lands
which
no
one
else
in
the
place
understood
anything
about
how
she
was
reputed
to
be
a
witch
and
was
believed
to
have
cast
her
spells
on
the
unhappy
sigurd
to
the
destruction
of
his
reason
and
how
nobody
could
tell
where
sigurd
himself
had
come
from
all
this
dyceworthy
had
heard
with
much
interest
and
as
the
sensual
part
of
his
nature
was
always
more
or
less
predominant
he
had
resolved
in
his
own
mind
that
here
was
a
field
of
action
suitable
to
his
abilities
to
tame
and
break
the
evil
spirit
in
the
reputed
witch
to
convert
her
to
the
holy
and
edifying
lutheran
faith
to
save
her
soul
for
the
lord
and
take
her
beautiful
body
for
himself
these
were
dyceworthy
laudable
ambitions
there
was
no
rival
to
oppose
him
and
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
mature
his
plans
so
he
had
thought
he
had
not
bargained
for
the
appearance
of
sir
philip
bruce
errington
on
the
scene
a
man
young
handsome
and
with
vast
wealth
to
back
up
his
pretensions
should
he
make
any
how
did
he
find
her
out
thought
the
reverend
charles
as
he
dolefully
pulled
his
craft
along
and
that
brutal
pagan
güldmar
too
who
pretends
he
can
not
endure
strangers
and
as
he
meditated
a
flush
of
righteous
indignation
crimsoned
his
flabby
features
let
her
take
care
he
half
muttered
with
a
smile
that
was
not
pleasant
let
her
take
care
there
are
more
ways
than
one
to
bring
down
her
pride
sir
philip
errington
must
be
too
rich
and
popular
in
his
own
country
to
think
of
wishing
to
marry
a
girl
who
is
only
a
daughter
after
all
he
may
trifle
with
her
yes
and
he
will
help
me
by
so
doing
the
more
mud
on
her
name
the
better
for
me
the
more
disgrace
the
more
need
of
rescue
and
the
more
grateful
she
will
have
to
be
just
a
word
to
ulrika
and
the
scandal
will
spread
patience
patience
and
somewhat
cheered
by
his
own
reflections
though
still
wearing
an
air
of
offended
dignity
he
rowed
on
glancing
up
every
now
and
then
to
see
if
the
had
returned
but
her
place
was
still
empty
meanwhile
as
he
thought
and
planned
other
thoughts
and
plans
were
being
discussed
at
a
meeting
which
was
held
in
a
little
ruined
stone
hut
situated
behind
some
trees
on
a
dreary
hill
just
outside
bosekop
it
was
a
miserable
place
barren
of
foliage
the
ground
was
dry
and
yellow
and
the
hut
itself
looked
as
if
it
had
been
struck
by
lightning
the
friends
whose
taste
had
led
them
to
select
this
dilapidated
dwelling
as
a
place
of
conference
were
two
in
number
both
women
one
of
them
no
other
than
the
minister
servant
the
ulrika
she
was
crouched
on
the
in
an
attitude
of
utter
abasement
at
the
feet
of
her
companion
an
aged
dame
of
tall
and
imposing
appearance
who
standing
erect
looked
down
upon
her
with
an
air
of
mingled
contempt
and
malevolence
the
hut
was
rather
dark
for
the
roof
was
not
sufficiently
destroyed
to
have
the
advantage
of
being
open
to
the
sky
the
sunlight
fell
through
holes
of
different
shapes
and
sizes
one
specially
bright
patch
of
radiance
illumining
the
stately
form
and
strongly
marked
though
withered
features
of
the
elder
woman
whose
eyes
deeply
sunken
in
her
head
glittered
with
a
and
evil
lustre
as
they
rested
on
the
prostrate
figure
before
her
when
she
spoke
her
accents
were
harsh
and
commanding
how
long
she
said
how
long
must
i
wait
how
long
must
i
watch
the
work
of
satan
in
the
land
the
fields
are
barren
and
will
not
bring
forth
the
curse
of
bitter
poverty
is
upon
us
all
and
only
he
the
pagan
güldmar
prospers
and
gathers
in
harvest
while
all
around
him
starve
do
i
not
know
the
devil
work
when
i
see
it
i
the
chosen
servant
of
the
lord
and
she
struck
a
tall
staff
she
held
violently
into
the
ground
to
emphasize
her
words
am
i
not
left
deserted
in
my
age
the
child
britta
sole
daughter
of
my
sole
daughter
is
she
not
stolen
and
kept
from
me
has
not
her
heart
been
utterly
turned
away
from
mine
all
through
that
vile
witch
accursèd
of
god
and
man
she
it
is
who
casts
the
blight
on
our
land
she
it
is
who
makes
the
hands
and
hearts
of
our
men
heavy
and
careless
so
that
even
luck
has
left
the
fishing
and
yet
you
hesitate
you
delay
you
will
not
fulfill
your
promise
i
tell
you
there
are
those
in
bosekop
who
at
my
bidding
would
cast
her
naked
into
the
fjord
leave
her
there
to
sink
or
swim
according
to
her
nature
i
know
murmured
ulrika
humbly
raising
herself
slightly
from
her
kneeling
posture
i
know
it
well
but
good
lovisa
be
patient
i
work
for
the
best
dyceworthy
will
do
more
for
us
than
we
can
do
for
ourselves
he
is
wise
and
cautious
lovisa
interrupted
her
with
a
fierce
gesture
fool
she
cried
what
need
of
caution
a
witch
is
a
witch
burn
her
drown
her
there
is
no
other
remedy
but
two
days
since
the
child
of
my
neighbor
engla
passed
her
on
the
fjord
and
now
the
boy
has
sickened
of
some
strange
disease
and
is
said
he
will
die
again
the
drove
of
cattle
owned
by
hildmar
bjorn
were
herded
home
when
she
passed
by
now
they
are
seized
by
the
murrain
plague
tell
your
good
saint
dyceworthy
these
things
if
he
can
find
no
cure
can
and
ulrika
shuddered
slightly
as
she
rose
from
the
ground
and
stood
erect
drawing
her
shawl
closely
about
her
you
hate
her
so
much
lovisa
she
asked
almost
timidly
lovisa
face
darkened
and
her
yellow
hand
closed
round
her
strong
staff
in
a
cruel
and
threatening
manner
hate
her
she
muttered
i
have
hated
her
ever
since
she
was
born
i
hated
her
mother
before
her
a
nest
of
devils
every
one
of
them
and
the
curse
will
always
be
upon
us
while
they
dwell
here
she
paused
and
looked
at
ulrika
steadily
remember
she
said
with
an
evil
leer
on
her
lips
i
hold
a
secret
of
yours
that
is
worth
the
keeping
i
give
you
two
weeks
more
within
that
time
you
must
act
destroy
the
witch
bring
back
to
me
my
grandchild
britta
or
else
it
will
be
turn
and
she
laughed
silently
ulrika
face
grew
paler
and
the
hand
that
grasped
the
folds
of
her
shawl
trembled
violently
she
made
an
effort
however
to
appear
composed
as
she
answered
i
have
sworn
to
obey
you
lovisa
and
i
will
but
tell
me
one
thing
how
do
you
know
that
thelma
güldmar
is
indeed
a
witch
how
do
i
know
almost
yelled
lovisa
have
i
lived
all
these
years
for
nothing
look
at
her
am
like
her
are
like
her
are
any
of
the
honest
women
of
the
neighborhood
like
her
meet
her
on
the
hills
with
knives
and
pins
prick
her
and
see
if
the
blood
will
flow
i
swear
it
will
not
not
one
drop
her
skin
is
too
white
there
is
no
blood
in
those
veins
only
fire
look
at
the
pink
in
her
cheeks
the
transparency
of
her
flesh
the
glittering
light
in
her
eyes
the
gold
of
her
hair
it
is
all
devil
work
it
is
not
human
it
is
not
natural
i
have
watched
her
i
used
to
watch
her
mother
and
curse
her
every
time
i
saw
her
ay
curse
her
till
i
was
breathless
with
cursing
she
stopped
abruptly
ulrika
gazed
at
her
with
as
much
wonder
as
her
plain
heavy
face
was
capable
of
expressing
lovisa
saw
the
look
and
smiled
darkly
one
would
think
had
never
known
what
love
is
she
said
with
a
sort
of
grim
satire
in
her
tone
yet
even
your
dull
soul
was
on
fire
once
but
i
when
i
was
young
i
had
beauty
such
as
you
never
had
and
i
loved
olaf
güldmar
ulrika
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
you
and
yet
you
hate
him
now
lovisa
raised
her
hand
with
an
imperious
gesture
i
have
grown
hate
like
a
flower
in
my
breast
she
said
with
a
sort
of
stern
impressiveness
i
have
fostered
it
year
after
year
and
now
it
has
grown
too
strong
for
me
when
olaf
güldmar
was
young
he
told
me
i
was
fair
once
he
kissed
my
cheek
at
parting
for
those
words
for
that
kiss
i
loved
him
then
for
the
same
things
i
hate
him
now
when
i
know
he
had
married
i
cursed
him
on
the
day
of
my
own
marriage
with
a
man
i
despised
i
cursed
him
i
have
followed
him
and
all
his
surroundings
with
more
curses
than
there
are
hours
in
the
day
i
have
had
some
little
revenge
yes
and
she
laughed
grimly
but
i
want
more
for
britta
has
been
caught
by
his
daughter
evil
spell
britta
is
mine
and
i
must
have
her
back
understand
me
well
do
what
you
have
to
do
without
delay
surely
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
ruin
a
woman
ulrika
stood
as
though
absorbed
in
meditation
and
said
nothing
for
some
moments
at
last
she
murmured
as
though
to
herself
dyceworthy
could
do
much
if
ask
him
then
said
lovisa
imperatively
tell
him
the
village
is
in
fear
of
her
tell
him
that
if
he
will
do
nothing
will
and
if
all
fails
come
to
me
again
and
remember
i
shall
not
only
act
i
shall
and
emphasizing
the
last
word
as
a
sort
of
threat
she
turned
and
strode
out
of
the
hut
ulrika
followed
more
slowly
taking
a
different
direction
to
that
in
which
her
late
companion
was
seen
rapidly
disappearing
on
returning
to
the
minister
dwelling
she
found
that
dyceworthy
had
not
yet
come
back
from
his
boating
excursion
she
gave
no
explanation
of
her
absence
to
her
two
but
went
straight
up
to
her
own
room
a
bare
attic
in
the
roof
where
she
deliberately
took
off
her
dress
and
bared
her
shoulders
and
breast
then
she
knelt
down
on
the
rough
boards
and
clasping
her
hands
began
to
writhe
and
wrestle
as
though
she
were
seized
with
a
sudden
convulsion
she
groaned
and
tortured
the
tears
from
her
eyes
she
pinched
her
own
flesh
till
it
was
black
and
blue
and
scratched
it
with
her
nails
till
it
bled
and
she
prayed
inaudibly
but
with
evident
desperation
sometimes
her
gestures
were
frantic
sometimes
appealing
but
she
made
no
noise
that
was
loud
enough
to
attract
attention
from
any
of
the
dwellers
in
the
house
her
stolid
features
were
contorted
with
anguish
and
had
she
been
an
erring
nun
of
the
creed
she
held
in
such
bitter
abhorrence
who
for
some
untold
crime
endured
a
penance
she
could
not
have
punished
her
own
flesh
much
more
severely
she
remained
some
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
thus
then
rising
from
her
knees
she
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
herself
and
with
her
usual
calm
immovable
aspect
though
smarting
from
the
injuries
she
had
inflicted
on
herself
she
descended
to
the
kitchen
there
to
prepare
dyceworthy
tea
with
all
the
punctilious
care
and
nicety
befitting
the
meal
of
so
good
a
man
and
so
perfect
a
saint
chapter
x
she
believed
that
by
dealing
nobly
with
all
all
would
show
themselves
noble
so
that
whatsoever
she
did
became
her
hafiz
as
the
afternoon
lengthened
and
the
sun
lowered
his
glittering
shield
towards
that
part
of
the
horizon
where
he
rested
a
brief
while
without
setting
the
her
white
sails
spread
to
the
cool
refreshing
breeze
swept
gracefully
and
swiftly
back
to
her
old
place
on
the
fjord
and
her
anchor
dropped
with
musical
clank
and
splash
just
as
dyceworthy
entered
his
house
fatigued
perspiring
and
at
the
of
his
day
all
on
board
the
yacht
were
at
dinner
a
dinner
of
the
most
tasteful
and
elegant
description
such
as
sir
philip
errington
well
knew
how
to
order
and
superintend
and
thelma
leaning
against
the
violet
velvet
cushions
that
were
piled
behind
her
for
her
greater
ease
looked
as
she
indeed
was
the
veritable
queen
of
the
feast
macfarlane
and
duprèz
had
been
rendered
astonished
and
bashful
by
her
excessive
beauty
from
the
moment
she
came
on
board
with
her
father
clad
in
her
simple
white
gown
with
a
deep
crimson
hood
drawn
over
her
fair
hair
and
tied
under
her
rounded
chin
she
had
taken
them
all
captive
they
were
her
abject
slaves
in
heart
though
they
put
on
very
creditable
airs
of
manly
independence
and
nonchalance
each
man
in
his
different
way
strove
to
amuse
or
interest
her
except
strange
to
say
errington
himself
who
though
deeply
courteous
to
her
kept
somewhat
in
the
background
and
appeared
more
anxious
to
render
himself
agreeable
to
old
olaf
güldmar
than
to
win
the
good
graces
of
his
lovely
daughter
the
girl
was
delighted
with
everything
on
board
the
yacht
she
admired
its
elegance
and
luxury
with
enthusiasm
she
gloried
in
the
speed
with
which
its
glittering
prow
cleaved
the
waters
she
clapped
her
hands
at
the
hiss
of
the
white
foam
as
it
split
into
a
creaming
pathway
for
the
rushing
vessel
and
she
was
so
unaffected
and
graceful
in
all
her
actions
and
attitudes
that
the
slow
blood
of
the
cautious
macfarlane
began
to
warm
up
by
degrees
to
a
most
unwonted
heat
of
admiration
when
she
had
first
arrived
errington
in
receiving
her
had
seriously
apologized
for
not
having
some
lady
to
meet
her
but
she
seemed
not
to
understand
his
meaning
her
naïve
smile
and
frankly
uplifted
eyes
put
all
his
suddenly
conceived
notions
of
social
stiffness
to
flight
why
should
a
lady
come
she
asked
sweetly
it
is
not
necessary
of
course
it
is
said
lorimer
promptly
and
delightedly
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
able
to
amuse
you
miss
güldmar
oh
for
that
she
replied
with
a
little
shrug
that
had
something
french
about
it
i
amuse
myself
always
i
am
amused
now
you
must
not
trouble
yourselves
as
she
was
introduced
to
duprèz
and
macfarlane
she
gave
them
each
a
quaint
sweeping
curtsy
which
had
the
effect
of
making
them
feel
the
most
ungainly
lumbersome
fellows
on
the
face
of
the
earth
macfarlane
grew
secretly
enraged
at
the
length
of
his
legs
while
pierre
duprèz
though
his
bow
was
entirely
parisian
decided
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
jerky
and
not
good
style
she
was
perfectly
unembarrassed
with
all
the
young
men
she
laughed
at
their
jokes
and
turned
her
glorious
eyes
full
on
them
with
the
unabashed
sweetness
of
innocence
she
listened
to
the
accounts
they
gave
her
of
their
fishing
and
climbing
excursions
with
the
most
eager
interest
and
in
her
turn
she
told
them
of
fresh
nooks
and
streams
and
waterfalls
of
which
they
had
never
even
heard
the
names
not
only
were
they
enchanted
with
her
but
they
were
thoroughly
delighted
with
her
father
olaf
güldmar
the
sturdy
old
pagan
was
in
the
best
of
humors
and
seemed
determined
to
be
pleased
with
everything
he
told
good
stories
and
laughed
that
rollicking
jovial
laugh
of
his
with
such
unforced
heartiness
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
dull
in
his
company
and
not
one
of
errington
companions
gave
a
thought
to
the
reports
concerning
him
and
his
daughter
which
had
been
so
gratuitously
related
by
dyceworthy
they
had
had
a
glorious
day
sail
piloted
by
valdemar
svensen
whose
astonishment
at
seeing
the
güldmars
on
board
the
was
depicted
in
his
face
but
who
prudently
forebore
from
making
any
remarks
thereon
the
hailed
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
much
in
the
tone
of
a
master
addressing
a
servant
and
thelma
smiled
kindly
at
him
but
the
boundary
line
between
superior
and
inferior
was
in
this
case
very
strongly
marked
and
neither
side
showed
any
intention
of
overstepping
it
in
the
course
of
the
day
duprèz
had
accidentally
lapsed
into
french
whereupon
to
his
surprise
thelma
had
answered
him
in
the
same
tongue
though
with
a
different
and
much
softer
pronunciation
her
had
the
mellifluous
sweetness
of
the
provencal
dialect
and
on
his
eagerly
questioning
her
he
learned
that
she
had
received
her
education
in
a
large
convent
at
arles
where
she
had
learned
french
from
the
nuns
her
father
overheard
her
talking
of
her
and
he
added
yes
i
sent
my
girl
away
for
her
education
though
i
know
the
teaching
is
good
in
christiania
yet
it
did
not
seem
good
enough
for
her
besides
your
modern
education
is
not
the
thing
for
a
woman
it
is
too
heavy
and
commonplace
thelma
knows
nothing
about
mathematics
or
algebra
she
can
sing
and
read
and
write
and
what
is
more
she
can
spin
and
sew
but
even
these
things
were
not
the
first
consideration
with
me
i
wanted
her
disposition
trained
and
her
bodily
health
attended
to
i
said
to
those
good
women
at
arles
here
here
a
child
for
you
i
do
care
how
much
or
how
little
she
knows
about
accomplishments
i
want
her
to
be
sound
and
sweet
from
head
to
heel
a
clean
mind
in
a
wholesome
body
teach
her
and
make
her
prefer
death
to
a
lie
show
her
the
curse
of
a
shrewish
temper
and
the
blessing
of
cheerfulness
that
will
satisfy
me
i
dare
say
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
those
nuns
thought
me
an
odd
customer
but
at
any
rate
they
seemed
to
understand
me
thelma
was
very
happy
with
them
and
considering
all
things
the
old
man
eyes
twinkled
fondly
she
has
turned
out
so
badly
they
laughed
and
thelma
blushed
as
errington
dreamy
eyes
rested
on
her
with
a
look
which
though
he
was
unconscious
of
it
spoke
passionate
admiration
the
day
passed
too
quickly
with
them
all
and
now
as
they
sat
at
dinner
in
the
richly
ornamented
saloon
there
was
not
one
among
them
who
could
contemplate
without
reluctance
the
approaching
of
so
pleasant
a
party
dessert
was
served
and
as
thelma
toyed
with
the
fruit
on
her
plate
and
sipped
her
glass
of
champagne
her
face
grew
serious
and
absorbed
even
sad
and
she
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
the
merry
chatter
of
tongues
around
her
till
errington
voice
asking
a
question
of
her
father
roused
her
into
swift
attention
do
you
know
any
one
of
the
name
of
sigurd
he
was
saying
a
poor
fellow
whose
wits
are
in
heaven
let
us
hope
for
they
certainly
are
not
on
earth
olaf
güldmar
fine
face
softened
with
pity
and
he
replied
sigurd
have
you
met
him
then
ah
poor
boy
his
is
a
sad
fate
he
has
wit
enough
but
it
works
wrongly
the
brain
is
there
but
is
twisted
yes
we
know
sigurd
well
enough
his
home
is
with
us
in
default
of
a
better
ay
ay
we
snatched
him
from
death
perhaps
unwisely
yet
he
has
a
good
heart
and
finds
pleasure
in
his
life
he
is
a
kind
of
poet
in
his
own
way
went
on
errington
watching
thelma
as
she
listened
intently
to
their
conversation
do
you
know
he
actually
visited
me
on
board
here
last
night
and
begged
me
to
go
away
from
the
altenfjord
altogether
he
seemed
afraid
of
me
as
if
he
thought
i
meant
to
do
him
some
harm
how
strange
murmured
thelma
sigurd
never
speaks
to
visitors
he
is
too
shy
i
can
not
understand
his
motive
ah
my
dear
sighed
her
father
has
he
any
motive
at
all
and
does
he
ever
understand
himself
his
fancies
change
with
every
shifting
breeze
i
will
tell
you
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
errington
how
he
came
to
be
as
it
were
a
bit
of
our
home
just
before
thelma
was
born
i
was
walking
with
my
wife
one
day
on
the
shore
when
we
both
caught
sight
of
something
bumping
against
our
little
pier
like
a
large
box
or
basket
i
managed
to
get
hold
of
it
with
a
and
drag
it
in
it
was
a
sort
of
creel
such
as
is
used
to
pack
fish
in
and
in
it
was
the
naked
body
of
a
child
it
was
an
ugly
little
creature
a
newly
born
infant
deformity
and
on
its
chest
there
was
a
horrible
scar
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
as
though
it
had
been
gashed
deeply
with
a
i
thought
it
was
dead
and
was
for
throwing
it
back
into
the
fjord
but
my
wife
a
angel
took
the
poor
wretched
little
wet
body
in
her
arms
and
found
that
it
breathed
she
warmed
it
dried
it
and
wrapped
it
in
her
shawl
and
after
awhile
the
tiny
monster
opened
its
eyes
and
stared
at
her
well
somehow
neither
of
us
could
forget
the
look
it
gave
us
such
a
solemn
warning
pitiful
appealing
sort
of
expression
there
was
no
resisting
it
so
we
took
the
foundling
and
did
the
best
we
could
for
him
we
gave
him
the
name
of
sigurd
and
when
thelma
was
born
the
two
babies
used
to
play
together
all
day
and
we
never
noticed
anything
wrong
with
the
boy
except
his
natural
deformity
till
he
was
about
ten
or
twelve
years
old
then
we
saw
to
our
sorrow
that
the
gods
had
chosen
to
play
havoc
with
his
wits
however
we
humored
him
tenderly
and
he
was
always
manageable
poor
sigurd
he
adored
my
wife
i
have
known
him
listen
for
hours
to
catch
the
sound
of
her
footstep
he
would
actually
deck
the
threshold
with
flowers
in
the
morning
that
she
might
tread
on
them
as
she
passed
by
the
old
bonds
sighed
and
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
with
a
gesture
half
of
pain
half
of
impatience
and
now
he
is
slave
a
regular
servant
to
her
she
can
manage
him
best
of
us
all
he
is
as
docile
as
a
lamb
and
will
do
anything
she
tells
him
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
said
the
gallant
duprèz
there
is
reason
in
such
obedience
thelma
looked
at
him
inquiringly
ignoring
the
implied
compliment
you
think
so
she
said
simply
i
am
glad
i
always
hope
that
he
will
one
day
be
well
in
mind
and
every
little
sign
of
reason
in
him
is
pleasant
to
me
duprèz
was
silent
it
was
evidently
no
use
making
even
an
attempt
at
flattering
this
strange
girl
surely
she
must
be
dense
not
to
understand
compliments
that
most
other
women
compel
from
the
lips
of
men
as
their
right
he
was
confused
his
paris
breeding
was
no
use
to
him
in
fact
he
had
been
at
a
loss
all
day
and
his
conversation
had
even
to
himself
seemed
particularly
shallow
and
frothy
this
mademoiselle
güldmar
as
he
called
her
was
by
no
means
stupid
she
was
not
a
mere
moving
statue
of
lovely
flesh
and
perfect
color
whose
outward
beauty
was
her
only
recommendation
she
was
on
the
contrary
of
a
most
superior
intelligence
she
had
read
much
and
thought
more
and
the
dignified
elegance
of
her
manner
and
bearing
would
have
done
honor
to
a
queen
after
all
thought
duprèz
musingly
the
social
creeds
of
paris
be
wrong
it
was
just
possible
there
might
be
women
who
were
womanly
there
might
be
beautiful
girls
who
were
neither
vain
nor
frivolous
there
might
even
be
creatures
of
the
feminine
sex
besides
whom
a
trained
parisian
coquette
would
seem
nothing
more
than
a
painted
fiend
of
the
neuter
gender
these
were
new
and
startling
considerations
to
the
mind
of
the
frenchman
and
unconsciously
his
fancy
began
to
busy
itself
with
the
old
romantic
histories
of
the
ancient
french
chivalry
when
faith
and
love
and
loyalty
kept
white
the
lilies
of
france
and
the
stately
courtesy
and
unflinching
pride
of
the
made
its
name
honored
throughout
the
world
an
odd
direction
indeed
for
pierre
duprèz
reflection
to
wander
in
he
who
never
reflected
on
either
past
or
future
but
was
content
to
fritter
away
the
present
as
pleasantly
as
might
be
and
the
only
reason
to
which
his
unusually
serious
reverie
could
be
attributed
was
the
presence
of
thelma
she
certainly
had
a
strange
influence
on
them
all
though
she
herself
was
not
aware
of
it
and
not
only
errington
but
each
one
of
his
companions
had
been
deeply
considering
during
the
day
that
notwithstanding
the
unheroic
tendency
of
modern
living
life
itself
might
be
turned
to
good
and
even
noble
account
if
only
an
effort
were
made
in
the
right
direction
such
was
the
compelling
effect
of
thelma
stainless
mind
reflected
in
her
pure
face
on
the
different
dispositions
of
all
the
young
men
and
she
perfectly
unconscious
of
it
smiled
at
them
and
conversed
gaily
little
knowing
as
she
talked
in
her
own
sweet
and
unaffected
way
that
the
most
profound
resolutions
were
being
formed
and
the
most
noble
and
unselfish
deeds
were
being
planned
in
the
souls
of
her
listeners
all
forsooth
because
one
fair
innocent
woman
had
in
the
clear
grave
glances
of
her
wondrous
eyes
suddenly
made
them
aware
of
their
own
utter
unworthiness
macfarlane
meditatively
watching
the
girl
from
under
his
pale
eyelashes
thought
of
matrimonial
pretensions
with
a
humorous
smile
hovering
on
his
thin
lips
ma
certes
the
fellow
has
an
unco
gude
opeenion
o
himself
he
mused
he
might
as
well
offer
his
hand
in
marriage
to
the
queen
while
aboot
it
he
wad
hae
just
as
muckle
chance
o
acceptance
meanwhile
errington
having
learned
all
he
wished
to
know
concerning
sigurd
was
skillfully
drawing
out
old
olaf
güldmar
and
getting
him
to
give
his
ideas
on
things
in
general
a
task
in
which
lorimer
joined
so
you
do
think
we
making
any
progress
nowadays
inquired
the
latter
with
an
appearance
of
interest
and
a
lazy
amusement
in
his
blue
eyes
as
he
put
the
question
progress
exclaimed
güldmar
not
a
bit
of
it
it
is
all
a
going
backward
it
may
not
seem
apparent
but
it
is
so
england
for
instance
is
losing
the
great
place
she
once
held
in
the
world
history
and
these
things
always
happen
to
all
nations
when
money
becomes
more
precious
to
the
souls
of
the
people
than
honesty
and
honor
i
take
the
universal
greed
of
gain
to
be
one
of
the
worst
signs
of
the
times
the
forewarning
of
some
great
upheaval
and
disaster
the
effects
of
which
no
human
mind
can
calculate
i
am
told
that
america
is
destined
to
be
the
dominating
power
of
the
future
but
i
doubt
it
its
politics
are
too
corrupt
its
people
live
too
fast
and
burn
their
candle
at
both
ends
which
is
unnatural
and
most
unwholesome
moreover
it
is
almost
destitute
of
art
in
its
highest
forms
and
is
not
its
confessed
watchward
almighty
dollar
and
such
a
country
as
that
expects
to
arrogate
to
itself
the
absolute
sway
of
the
world
i
tell
you
ten
thousand
times
it
is
destitute
of
nearly
everything
that
has
made
nations
great
and
in
historic
annals
and
my
belief
is
that
what
has
been
will
be
again
and
that
what
has
never
been
will
never
be
you
mean
by
that
i
suppose
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
doing
anything
new
no
way
of
branching
out
in
some
better
and
untried
direction
asked
errington
olaf
güldmar
shook
his
head
emphatically
you
ca
do
it
he
said
decisively
everything
in
every
way
has
been
begun
and
completed
and
then
forgotten
over
and
over
in
this
world
to
be
begun
and
completed
and
forgotten
again
and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
no
one
nation
is
better
than
another
in
this
respect
there
is
there
can
be
nothing
new
norway
for
example
has
had
its
day
whether
it
will
ever
have
another
i
know
not
at
any
rate
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
and
yet
what
a
past
he
broke
off
and
his
eyes
grew
meditative
lorimer
looked
at
him
you
would
have
been
a
viking
güldmar
had
you
lived
in
the
old
days
he
said
with
a
smile
i
should
indeed
returned
the
old
man
with
an
unconsciously
haughty
gesture
of
his
head
and
no
better
fate
could
have
befallen
me
to
sail
the
seas
in
hot
pursuit
of
one
enemies
or
in
search
of
further
conquest
to
feel
the
very
wind
and
sun
beating
up
the
blood
in
veins
to
live
the
life
of
a
a
true
man
in
all
the
pride
and
worth
of
strength
and
invincible
vigor
how
much
better
than
the
puling
feeble
sickly
existence
led
by
the
majority
of
men
i
dwell
apart
from
them
as
much
as
i
can
i
steep
my
mind
and
body
in
the
joys
of
nature
and
the
free
fresh
air
but
often
i
feel
that
the
old
days
of
the
heroes
must
have
been
best
when
gorm
the
bold
and
the
fierce
siegfried
seized
paris
and
stabled
their
horses
in
the
chapel
where
charlemagne
lay
buried
pierre
duprèz
looked
up
with
a
faint
smile
ah
but
that
was
surely
a
very
long
time
ago
true
said
güldmar
quietly
and
no
doubt
you
will
not
believe
the
story
at
this
distance
of
years
but
the
day
is
coming
when
people
will
look
back
on
the
little
chronicle
of
your
empire
your
commune
your
republic
all
your
little
affairs
and
will
say
these
things
are
myths
they
occurred
if
they
occurred
at
all
a
very
long
time
ago
monsieur
is
a
philosopher
said
duprèz
with
a
gesture
i
would
not
presume
to
contradict
him
you
see
my
lad
went
on
güldmar
more
gently
there
is
much
in
our
ancient
norwegian
history
that
is
forgotten
or
ignored
by
students
of
the
travellers
that
come
hither
come
to
see
the
glories
of
our
glaciers
and
fjords
but
they
think
little
or
nothing
of
the
vanished
tribe
of
heroes
who
once
possessed
the
land
if
you
know
your
greek
history
you
must
have
heard
of
pythias
who
lived
three
hundred
and
years
before
christ
and
who
was
taken
captive
by
a
band
of
norseman
and
carried
away
to
see
place
where
the
sun
slept
in
winter
most
probably
he
came
to
this
very
spot
the
altenfjord
at
any
rate
the
ancient
greeks
had
good
words
to
say
for
the
northwinders
as
they
called
us
norwegians
for
they
reported
us
to
be
living
in
peace
with
their
gods
and
themselves
again
one
of
the
oldest
tribes
in
the
world
came
among
us
in
times
past
the
phoenicians
there
are
traces
among
us
still
of
their
customs
and
manners
yes
we
have
a
great
deal
to
look
back
upon
with
pride
as
well
as
sorrow
and
much
as
i
hear
of
the
wonders
of
the
new
world
the
marvels
and
the
speed
of
american
manners
and
civilization
i
would
rather
be
a
norseman
than
a
yankee
and
he
laughed
there
more
dignity
in
the
name
at
any
rate
said
lorimer
but
i
say
güldmar
you
are
in
history
much
better
than
i
am
the
annals
of
my
country
were
grounded
into
my
tender
soul
early
in
life
but
i
have
a
very
hazy
recollection
of
them
i
know
henry
viii
got
rid
of
his
wives
expeditiously
and
conveniently
and
i
distinctly
remember
that
queen
elizabeth
wore
the
first
pair
of
silk
stockings
and
danced
a
kind
of
jig
in
them
with
the
earl
of
leicester
these
things
interested
me
at
the
time
and
they
now
seen
firmly
impressed
on
my
memory
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
that
might
possibly
be
more
important
old
güldmar
smiled
but
thelma
laughed
outright
and
her
eyes
danced
mirthfully
ah
i
do
know
you
now
she
said
nodding
her
fair
head
at
him
wisely
you
are
not
anything
that
is
to
be
believed
so
i
shall
well
understand
you
that
is
you
are
a
very
great
scholar
but
that
it
pleases
you
to
pretend
you
are
a
dunce
lorimer
face
brightened
into
a
very
gentle
and
winning
softness
as
he
looked
at
her
i
assure
you
miss
güldmar
i
am
not
pretending
in
the
least
i
no
scholar
errington
is
if
you
like
if
it
had
been
for
him
i
should
never
have
learned
anything
at
oxford
at
all
he
used
to
leap
over
a
difficulty
while
i
was
looking
at
it
phil
do
interrupt
me
you
know
you
did
i
tell
you
he
up
to
everything
greek
latin
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
what
more
he
writes
well
i
believe
though
he
never
forgive
me
for
mentioning
it
that
he
has
even
published
some
poems
be
quiet
george
exclaimed
errington
with
a
vexed
laugh
you
are
boring
miss
güldmar
to
death
what
is
asked
thelma
gently
and
then
turning
her
eyes
full
on
the
young
baronet
she
added
i
like
to
hear
that
you
will
pass
your
days
sometimes
without
shooting
the
birds
and
killing
the
fish
it
can
hurt
nobody
for
you
to
write
and
she
smiled
that
dreamy
pensive
smile
of
hers
that
was
so
infinitely
bewitching
you
must
show
me
all
your
sweet
poems
errington
colored
hotly
they
are
all
nonsense
miss
güldmar
he
said
quickly
there
nothing
about
them
i
tell
you
frankly
all
rubbish
every
line
of
them
then
you
should
not
write
them
said
thelma
quietly
it
is
only
a
pity
and
a
disappointment
i
wish
every
one
were
of
your
opinion
laughed
lorimer
it
would
spare
us
a
lot
of
indifferent
verse
ah
you
have
the
chief
skald
of
all
the
world
in
your
land
cried
güldmar
bringing
his
fist
down
with
a
jovial
thump
on
the
table
he
can
teach
you
all
that
you
need
to
know
queried
lorimer
dubiously
oh
you
mean
bard
i
suppose
you
allude
to
shakespeare
i
do
said
the
old
enthusiastically
he
is
the
only
glory
of
your
country
i
envy
i
would
give
anything
to
prove
him
a
norwegian
by
valhalla
had
he
but
been
one
of
the
bards
of
odin
the
world
might
have
followed
the
grand
old
creed
still
if
anything
could
ever
persuade
me
to
be
a
christian
it
would
be
the
fact
that
shakespeare
was
one
if
england
name
is
rendered
imperishable
it
will
be
through
the
fame
of
shakespeare
alone
just
as
we
have
a
kind
of
tenderness
for
degraded
modern
greece
because
of
homer
ay
ay
countries
and
nations
are
worthless
enough
it
is
only
the
great
names
of
heroes
that
endure
to
teach
the
lesson
that
is
never
learned
sufficiently
namely
that
man
and
man
alone
is
fitted
to
grasp
the
prize
of
immortality
ye
believe
in
immortality
inquired
macfarlane
seriously
güldmar
keen
eyes
lighted
on
him
with
fiery
impetuousness
believe
in
it
i
possess
it
how
can
it
be
taken
from
me
as
well
make
a
bird
without
wings
a
tree
without
sap
an
ocean
without
depths
as
expect
to
find
a
man
without
an
immortal
soul
what
a
question
to
ask
do
not
possess
heaven
gift
and
why
should
not
i
no
offense
said
macfarlane
secretly
astonished
at
the
old
fervor
for
had
not
he
though
himself
intending
to
become
a
devout
minister
of
the
word
had
not
he
now
and
then
felt
a
creeping
doubt
as
to
whether
after
all
there
was
any
truth
in
the
doctrine
of
another
life
than
this
one
i
only
thocht
ye
might
have
perhaps
questioned
the
probabeelity
in
your
own
mind
i
never
question
divine
authority
replied
olaf
güldmar
i
pity
those
that
do
and
this
divine
authority
said
duprèz
suddenly
with
a
delicate
sarcastic
smile
how
and
where
do
you
perceive
it
in
the
very
law
that
compels
me
to
exist
young
sir
said
güldmar
in
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
about
me
the
glory
of
the
heavens
the
wonders
of
the
sea
you
have
perhaps
lived
in
cities
all
your
life
and
your
mind
is
cramped
a
bit
no
wonder
you
can
hardly
see
the
stars
above
the
roofs
of
a
wilderness
of
houses
cities
are
men
work
the
gods
have
never
had
a
finger
in
the
building
of
them
dwelling
in
them
i
suppose
you
can
not
help
forgetting
divine
authority
altogether
but
here
here
among
the
mountains
you
would
soon
remember
it
you
should
live
here
it
would
make
a
man
of
you
and
you
do
not
consider
me
a
man
inquired
duprèz
with
imperturbable
güldmar
laughed
well
not
quite
he
admitted
candidly
there
not
enough
muscle
about
you
i
confess
i
like
to
see
strong
fellows
fellows
fit
to
rule
the
planet
on
which
they
are
placed
that
my
whim
but
you
a
neat
little
chap
enough
and
i
dare
say
you
can
hold
your
own
and
his
eyes
twinkled
as
he
filled
himself
another
glass
of
his
host
fine
burgundy
and
drank
it
off
while
duprèz
with
a
shrug
of
resignation
to
güldmar
verdict
on
his
personal
appearance
asked
thelma
if
she
would
favor
them
with
a
song
she
rose
from
her
seat
instantly
without
any
affected
hesitation
and
went
to
the
piano
she
had
a
delicate
touch
and
accompanied
herself
with
great
taste
but
her
voice
full
penetrating
rich
and
true
was
one
of
the
purest
and
most
sympathetic
ever
possessed
by
woman
and
its
freshness
was
unspoilt
by
any
of
the
varied
systems
of
torture
invented
by
for
the
ingenious
destruction
of
the
delicate
vocal
organ
she
sang
a
norwegian
in
the
original
tongue
which
might
be
roughly
translated
as
follows
lovest
thou
me
for
my
beauty
sake
love
me
not
then
love
the
victorious
glittering
sun
the
fadeless
deathless
marvellous
one
lovest
thou
me
for
my
youth
sake
love
me
not
then
love
the
triumphant
unperishing
spring
who
every
year
new
charms
doth
bring
lovest
thou
me
for
treasure
sake
oh
love
me
not
then
love
the
deep
the
wonderful
sea
its
jewels
are
worthier
love
than
me
lovest
thou
me
for
love
own
sake
ah
sweet
then
love
me
more
than
the
sun
and
the
spring
and
the
sea
is
the
faithful
heart
i
will
yield
to
thee
a
silence
greeted
the
close
of
her
song
though
the
young
men
were
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
still
old
güldmar
translated
them
for
their
benefit
they
could
feel
the
intensity
of
the
passion
vibrating
through
her
ringing
tones
and
errington
sighed
involuntarily
she
heard
the
sigh
and
turned
round
on
the
laughing
are
you
so
tired
or
sad
or
what
is
it
she
asked
merrily
it
is
too
melancholy
a
tune
and
i
was
foolish
to
sing
it
because
you
can
not
understand
the
meaning
of
it
it
is
all
about
love
and
of
course
love
is
always
sorrowful
always
asked
lorimer
with
a
i
do
not
know
she
said
frankly
with
a
pretty
deprecatory
gesture
of
her
hands
but
all
books
say
so
it
must
be
a
great
pain
and
also
a
great
happiness
let
me
think
what
i
can
sing
to
you
now
but
perhaps
you
will
yourself
sing
not
one
of
us
have
a
voice
miss
güldmar
said
errington
i
used
to
think
i
had
but
lorimer
discouraged
my
efforts
men
should
sing
observed
lorimer
if
they
only
knew
how
awfully
ridiculous
they
look
standing
up
in
and
white
ties
pouring
forth
inane
that
nobody
wants
to
hear
they
would
do
it
only
a
woman
looks
pretty
while
singing
ah
that
is
very
nice
said
thelma
with
a
demure
smile
then
i
am
agreeable
to
you
when
i
sing
agreeable
this
was
far
too
tame
a
word
they
all
rose
from
the
table
and
came
towards
her
with
many
assurances
of
their
delight
and
admiration
but
she
put
all
their
compliments
aside
with
a
little
gesture
that
was
both
incredulous
and
peremptory
you
must
not
say
so
many
things
in
praise
of
me
she
said
with
a
swift
upward
glance
at
errington
where
he
leaned
on
the
piano
regarding
her
it
is
nothing
to
be
able
to
sing
it
is
only
like
the
birds
but
we
can
not
understand
the
words
they
say
just
as
you
can
not
understand
norwegian
listen
here
is
a
little
ballad
you
will
all
know
and
she
played
a
soft
prelude
while
her
voice
subdued
to
a
plaintive
murmur
rippled
out
in
the
dainty
verses
of
sur
ma
lyre
fois
dans
un
bois
ma
main
préludait
à
peine
une
colombe
descend
en
passant
blanche
sur
le
luth
mais
au
lieu
touchants
de
doux
chants
la
colombe
gemissante
me
demande
par
pitié
sa
moitié
sa
moitié
loin
absente
she
sang
this
seriously
and
sweetly
till
she
came
to
the
last
three
lines
when
catching
errington
earnest
gaze
her
voice
quivered
and
her
cheeks
flushed
she
rose
from
the
piano
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
and
said
to
the
who
had
been
watching
her
with
proud
and
gratified
looks
it
is
growing
late
father
we
must
say
to
our
friends
and
return
home
not
yet
eagerly
implored
sir
philip
come
up
on
deck
we
will
have
coffee
there
and
afterwards
you
shall
leave
us
when
you
will
güldmar
acquiesced
in
this
arrangement
before
his
daughter
had
time
to
raise
any
objection
and
they
all
went
on
deck
where
a
comfortable
lounging
chair
was
placed
for
thelma
facing
the
most
gorgeous
portion
of
the
glowing
sky
which
on
this
evening
was
like
a
moving
mass
of
molten
gold
split
asunder
here
and
there
by
angry
rifts
of
crimson
the
young
men
grouped
themselves
together
at
the
prow
of
the
vessel
in
order
to
smoke
their
cigars
without
annoyance
to
thelma
old
güldmar
did
not
smoke
but
he
talked
and
errington
after
seeing
them
all
fairly
absorbed
in
an
argument
on
the
best
methods
of
spearing
salmon
moved
quietly
away
to
where
the
girl
was
sitting
her
great
pensive
eyes
fixed
on
the
burning
splendors
of
the
heavens
are
you
warm
enough
there
he
asked
and
there
was
an
unconscious
tenderness
in
his
voice
as
he
asked
the
question
or
shall
i
fetch
you
a
wrap
she
smiled
i
have
my
hood
she
said
it
is
the
warmest
thing
i
ever
wear
except
of
course
in
winter
philip
looked
at
the
hood
as
she
drew
it
more
closely
over
her
head
and
thought
that
surely
no
more
becoming
article
of
apparel
ever
was
designed
for
woman
wear
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
either
in
color
or
texture
it
was
of
a
peculiarly
warm
rich
crimson
like
the
heart
of
a
red
damask
rose
and
it
suited
the
bright
hair
and
tender
thoughtful
eyes
of
its
owner
to
perfection
tell
me
he
said
drawing
a
little
nearer
and
speaking
in
a
lower
tone
have
you
forgiven
me
for
my
rudeness
the
first
time
i
saw
you
she
looked
a
little
troubled
perhaps
also
i
was
rude
she
said
gently
i
did
not
know
you
i
thought
you
were
quite
right
he
eagerly
interrupted
her
it
was
very
impertinent
of
me
to
ask
you
for
your
name
i
should
have
found
it
out
for
myself
as
i
done
and
he
smiled
at
her
as
he
said
the
last
words
with
marked
emphasis
she
raised
her
eyes
wistfully
and
you
are
glad
she
asked
softly
and
with
a
sort
of
wonder
in
her
accents
glad
to
know
your
name
glad
to
know
of
course
can
you
ask
such
a
question
but
why
persisted
thelma
it
is
not
as
if
you
were
lonely
you
have
friends
already
we
are
nothing
to
you
soon
you
will
go
away
and
you
will
think
of
the
altenfjord
as
a
dream
and
our
names
will
be
forgotten
that
is
natural
what
a
foolish
rush
of
passion
filled
his
heart
as
she
spoke
in
those
mellow
almost
plaintive
accents
what
wild
words
leaped
to
his
lips
and
what
an
effort
it
cost
him
to
keep
them
hack
the
heat
and
impetuosity
of
romeo
whom
up
to
the
present
he
had
been
inclined
to
consider
a
particularly
stupid
youth
was
now
quite
comprehensible
to
his
mind
and
he
the
cool
englishman
was
ready
at
that
moment
to
outrival
juliet
lover
in
his
utmost
excesses
of
amorous
folly
in
spite
of
his
his
voice
quivered
a
little
as
he
answered
her
i
shall
never
forget
the
altenfjord
or
you
miss
güldmar
do
you
know
there
are
some
things
that
can
not
be
forgotten
such
as
a
sudden
glimpse
of
fine
scenery
a
beautiful
song
or
a
pathetic
poem
she
bent
her
head
in
assent
and
here
there
is
so
much
to
remember
the
light
of
the
midnight
sun
the
glorious
mountains
the
loveliness
of
the
whole
land
is
it
better
than
other
countries
you
have
seen
asked
the
girl
with
some
interest
much
better
returned
sir
philip
fervently
in
fact
there
is
no
place
like
it
in
my
opinion
he
paused
at
the
sound
of
her
pretty
laughter
you
are
what
is
it
ecstatic
she
said
mirthfully
tell
me
have
you
been
to
the
south
of
france
and
the
pyrenees
of
course
i
have
he
replied
i
have
been
all
over
the
continent
travelled
about
it
till
i
tired
of
it
do
you
like
the
south
of
france
better
than
norway
no
not
so
very
much
better
she
said
dubiously
and
yet
a
little
it
is
so
warm
and
bright
there
and
the
people
are
gay
here
they
are
stern
and
sullen
my
father
loves
to
sail
the
seas
and
when
i
first
went
to
school
at
arles
he
took
me
a
long
and
beautiful
voyage
we
went
from
christiansund
to
holland
and
saw
all
those
pretty
dutch
cities
with
their
canals
and
quaint
bridges
then
we
went
through
the
english
channel
to
brest
then
by
the
bay
of
biscay
to
bayonne
bayonne
seemed
to
me
very
lovely
but
we
left
it
soon
and
travelled
a
long
way
by
land
seeing
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
till
we
came
to
arles
and
though
it
is
such
a
long
route
and
not
one
for
many
persons
to
take
i
have
travelled
to
arles
and
back
twice
that
way
so
all
there
is
familiar
to
me
and
in
some
things
i
do
think
it
better
than
norway
what
induced
your
father
to
send
you
so
far
away
from
him
asked
philip
rather
curiously
the
girl
eyes
softened
tenderly
ah
that
is
easy
to
understand
she
said
my
mother
came
from
arles
she
was
french
then
he
exclaimed
with
some
surprise
no
she
answered
gravely
she
was
norwegian
because
her
father
and
mother
both
were
of
this
land
she
was
what
they
call
sadly
you
must
not
ask
me
any
more
about
her
please
errington
apologized
at
once
with
some
embarrassment
and
a
deeper
color
than
usual
on
his
face
she
looked
up
at
him
quite
frankly
it
is
possible
i
will
tell
you
her
history
some
day
she
said
when
we
shall
know
each
other
better
i
do
like
to
talk
to
you
very
much
i
suppose
there
are
many
englishmen
like
you
philip
laughed
i
do
think
i
am
at
all
exceptional
why
do
you
ask
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
have
seen
some
of
them
she
said
slowly
and
they
are
stupid
they
shoot
shoot
fish
fish
all
day
and
eat
a
great
deal
my
dear
miss
güldmar
i
also
do
all
these
things
declared
errington
amusedly
these
are
only
our
surface
faults
englishmen
are
the
best
fellows
to
be
found
anywhere
you
must
judge
them
by
their
athletic
sports
or
their
vulgar
appetites
you
must
appeal
to
their
hearts
when
you
want
to
know
them
or
to
their
pockets
and
you
will
know
them
still
better
said
thelma
almost
mischievously
as
she
raised
herself
in
her
chair
to
take
a
cup
of
coffee
from
the
tray
that
was
then
being
handed
to
her
by
the
respectful
steward
ah
how
good
this
is
it
reminds
me
of
our
coffee
luncheon
at
arles
errington
watched
her
with
a
but
said
no
more
as
the
others
now
came
up
to
claim
their
share
of
her
company
i
say
said
lorimer
lazily
throwing
himself
full
length
on
the
deck
and
looking
up
at
her
come
and
see
us
spear
a
salmon
miss
güldmar
your
father
is
going
to
show
us
how
to
do
it
in
the
proper
norse
style
that
is
for
men
said
thelma
loftily
women
must
know
nothing
about
such
things
by
jove
and
lorimer
looked
profoundly
astonished
why
miss
güldmar
women
are
going
in
for
everything
nowadays
hunting
shooting
duelling
lecturing
heaven
knows
what
they
stop
at
nothing
is
a
mere
trifle
in
the
list
of
modern
feminine
accomplishments
thelma
smiled
down
upon
him
benignly
you
will
always
be
the
same
she
said
with
a
sort
of
indulgent
air
it
is
your
delight
to
say
things
upside
down
but
you
shall
not
make
me
believe
that
women
do
all
these
dreadful
things
because
how
is
it
possible
the
men
would
not
allow
them
errington
laughed
and
lorimer
appeared
stupefied
with
surprise
the
men
would
not
allow
them
he
repeated
slowly
oh
miss
güldmar
little
do
you
realize
the
state
of
things
at
the
present
day
the
glamor
of
viking
memories
clings
about
you
still
do
you
know
the
power
of
man
has
passed
away
and
that
ladies
do
exactly
as
they
like
it
is
easier
to
control
the
thunderbolt
than
to
prevent
a
woman
having
her
own
way
all
that
is
nonsense
said
thelma
decidedly
where
there
is
a
man
to
rule
he
rule
that
is
certain
is
that
positively
your
opinion
and
lorimer
looked
more
astonished
than
ever
it
is
everybody
opinion
of
course
averred
thelma
how
foolish
it
would
be
if
women
did
not
obey
men
the
world
would
be
all
confusion
ah
you
see
you
can
not
make
me
think
your
funny
thoughts
it
is
no
use
and
she
laughed
and
rose
from
her
chair
adding
with
a
gentle
persuasive
air
father
dear
is
it
not
time
to
say
truly
i
think
it
is
returned
güldmar
giving
himself
a
shake
like
an
old
lion
as
he
broke
off
a
rather
tedious
conversation
he
had
been
having
with
macfarlane
we
shall
have
sigurd
coming
to
look
for
us
and
poor
britta
will
think
we
have
left
her
too
long
alone
thank
you
my
lad
this
to
sir
philip
who
instantly
gave
orders
for
the
boat
to
be
lowered
you
have
given
us
a
day
of
thorough
wholesome
enjoyment
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
return
it
in
some
way
you
must
let
me
see
as
much
of
you
as
possible
they
shook
hands
cordially
and
errington
proposed
to
escort
them
back
as
far
as
their
own
pier
but
this
offer
güldmar
refused
nonsense
he
exclaimed
cheerily
with
four
oarsmen
to
row
us
along
why
should
we
take
you
away
from
your
friends
i
wo
hear
of
such
a
thing
and
now
regarding
the
great
fall
of
njedegorze
macfarlane
here
says
you
have
not
visited
it
yet
well
the
best
guide
you
can
have
there
is
sigurd
we
make
up
a
party
and
go
when
it
is
agreeable
to
you
it
is
a
grand
sight
well
worth
seeing
we
shall
meet
again
for
the
i
warrant
i
shall
be
able
to
make
the
time
pass
quickly
for
you
how
long
do
you
think
of
staying
here
as
long
as
possible
answered
errington
absently
his
eyes
wandering
to
thelma
who
was
just
then
shaking
hands
with
his
friends
and
bidding
them
farewell
güldmar
laughed
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
that
means
till
you
are
tired
of
the
place
he
said
well
you
shall
not
be
dull
if
i
can
prevent
it
and
thanks
for
your
hospitality
ah
yes
added
thelma
gently
coming
up
at
that
moment
and
laying
her
soft
hand
in
his
i
have
been
so
happy
all
day
and
it
is
all
your
kindness
i
am
very
grateful
it
is
i
who
have
cause
to
be
grateful
said
errington
hurriedly
clasping
her
hand
warmly
for
your
company
and
that
of
your
father
i
trust
we
shall
have
many
more
pleasant
days
together
i
hope
so
too
she
answered
simply
and
then
the
boat
being
ready
they
departed
errington
and
lorimer
leaned
on
the
waving
their
hats
and
watching
them
disappear
over
the
gleaming
water
till
the
very
last
glimpse
of
thelma
crimson
hood
had
vanished
and
then
they
turned
to
rejoin
their
companions
who
were
strolling
up
and
down
smoking
comme
un
ange
said
duprèz
briefly
in
short
i
doubt
if
the
angels
are
so
the
auld
pagan
a
fine
scholar
added
macfarlane
meditatively
he
corrected
me
in
a
bit
o
latin
did
he
indeed
and
lorimer
laughed
indolently
i
suppose
you
think
better
of
him
now
sandy
sandy
made
no
reply
and
as
errington
persisted
in
turning
the
conversation
away
from
the
merits
or
demerits
of
their
recent
guests
they
soon
entered
on
other
topics
but
that
night
before
retiring
to
rest
lorimer
laid
a
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
and
said
quietly
with
a
keen
look
well
old
man
have
you
made
up
your
mind
have
i
seen
the
future
lady
sir
philip
smiled
then
after
a
brief
pause
answered
steadily
yes
george
you
have
that
is
if
i
can
win
her
lorimer
laughed
a
little
and
sighed
there
no
doubt
about
that
phil
and
eyeing
errington
fine
figure
and
noble
features
musingly
he
repeated
again
thoughtfully
no
doubt
about
that
my
boy
then
after
a
pause
he
said
somewhat
abruptly
time
to
turn
in
good
night
good
night
old
fellow
and
errington
wrung
his
hand
warmly
and
left
him
to
repose
but
lorimer
had
rather
a
bad
night
he
tossed
and
tumbled
a
good
deal
and
had
dreams
unusual
visitors
with
him
and
once
or
twice
he
muttered
in
his
sleep
no
doubt
about
it
not
the
least
in
the
world
and
if
there
were
but
the
conclusion
of
this
sentence
was
inaudible

a
fortnight
passed
the
first
excursion
in
the
had
been
followed
by
others
of
a
similar
kind
and
errington
acquaintance
with
the
güldmars
was
fast
ripening
into
a
pleasant
intimacy
it
had
grown
customary
for
the
young
men
to
spend
that
part
of
the
day
which
in
spite
of
persistent
sunshine
they
still
called
evening
in
the
comfortable
quaint
parlor
of
the
old
farmhouse
looking
at
the
view
through
the
windows
listening
to
the
fantastic
legends
of
norway
as
told
by
olaf
güldmar
or
watching
thelma
picturesque
figure
as
she
sat
pensively
apart
in
her
shadowed
corner
spinning
they
had
fraternized
with
sigurd
too
that
is
as
far
as
he
would
permit
them
for
the
unhappy
dwarf
was
uncertain
of
temper
and
if
at
one
hour
he
were
docile
and
yielding
as
a
child
the
next
he
would
be
found
excited
and
furious
at
some
imaginary
slight
that
he
fancied
had
been
inflicted
upon
him
sometimes
if
he
would
talk
almost
rationally
only
allowing
his
fancy
to
play
with
poetical
ideas
concerning
the
sea
the
flowers
or
the
sunlight
but
he
was
far
more
often
sullen
and
silent
he
would
draw
a
low
chair
to
thelma
side
and
sit
there
with
eyes
and
compressed
lips
and
none
could
tell
whether
he
listened
to
the
conversation
around
him
or
was
utterly
indifferent
to
it
he
had
taken
a
notable
fancy
to
lorimer
but
he
avoided
errington
in
the
most
marked
and
persistent
manner
the
latter
did
his
best
to
overcome
this
unreasonable
dislike
but
his
efforts
were
useless
and
deciding
in
his
own
mind
that
it
was
best
to
humor
sigurd
vagaries
he
soon
let
him
alone
and
devoted
his
attention
more
entirely
to
thelma
one
evening
after
supper
at
the
farmhouse
lorimer
who
for
some
time
had
been
watching
philip
and
thelma
conversing
together
in
low
tones
near
the
open
window
rose
from
his
seat
quietly
without
disturbing
the
hilarity
of
the
who
was
in
the
middle
of
a
rollicking
told
for
macfarlane
entertainment
and
slipped
out
into
the
garden
where
he
strolled
along
rather
absently
till
he
found
himself
in
the
little
close
thicket
of
pines
the
very
same
spot
where
he
and
philip
had
stood
on
the
first
day
of
their
visit
thither
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
soft
emerald
moss
and
lit
a
cigar
sighing
rather
drearily
as
he
did
so
upon
my
life
he
mused
with
a
i
am
very
nearly
being
a
hero
a
regular
the
noble
creature
of
the
piece
by
jove
i
wish
i
were
a
soldier
i
certain
i
could
stand
the
fire
better
than
this
well
no
wonder
the
preachers
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
it
a
tough
uncomfortable
duty
but
am
i
not
a
bit
of
it
look
here
george
lorimer
here
he
tapped
himself
very
vigorously
on
his
broad
chest
do
you
imagine
yourself
to
be
either
virtuous
or
magnanimous
if
you
were
anything
of
a
man
at
all
you
would
never
let
your
feelings
get
the
better
of
you
you
would
be
sublimely
indifferent
stoically
calm
and
as
it
is
you
know
what
a
sneaking
state
of
envy
you
were
in
just
now
when
you
came
out
of
that
room
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
rascal
the
inner
self
he
thus
addressed
was
most
probably
abashed
by
this
adjuration
for
his
countenance
cleared
a
little
as
though
he
had
received
an
apology
from
his
own
conscience
he
puffed
lazily
at
his
cigar
and
felt
somewhat
soothed
light
steps
below
him
attracted
his
attention
and
looking
down
from
the
little
knoll
on
which
he
lay
he
saw
thelma
and
philip
pass
they
were
walking
slowly
along
a
little
winding
path
that
led
to
the
orchard
which
was
situated
at
some
little
distance
from
the
house
the
girl
head
was
bent
and
philip
was
talking
to
her
with
evident
eagerness
lorimer
looked
after
them
earnestly
and
his
honest
eyes
were
full
of
trouble
god
bless
them
both
he
murmured
half
aloud
there
no
harm
in
saying
that
any
how
dear
old
phil
i
wonder
whether
what
he
would
have
said
was
uncertain
for
at
that
moment
he
was
considerably
startled
by
the
sight
of
a
meagre
pale
face
peering
through
the
parted
pine
boughs
a
face
in
which
two
wild
eyes
shone
with
a
glitter
like
that
of
newly
sharpened
steel
hello
sigurd
said
lorimer
as
he
recognized
his
visitor
what
are
you
up
to
going
to
climb
a
tree
sigurd
pushed
aside
the
branches
cautiously
and
approached
he
sat
down
by
lorimer
and
taking
his
hand
kissed
it
deferentially
i
followed
you
i
saw
you
go
away
to
grieve
alone
i
came
to
grieve
also
he
said
with
a
patient
gentleness
lorimer
laughed
languidly
by
jove
sigurd
you
too
clever
for
your
age
think
i
came
away
to
grieve
eh
not
so
my
boy
came
away
to
smoke
there
a
for
you
i
never
grieve
do
know
how
to
do
it
what
grief
to
love
answered
sigurd
promptly
to
see
a
beautiful
elf
with
golden
wings
come
fluttering
fluttering
gently
down
from
the
sky
you
open
your
arms
to
catch
her
so
and
just
as
you
think
you
have
her
she
leans
only
a
little
bit
on
one
side
and
falls
not
into
your
heart
no
into
the
heart
of
some
one
else
that
is
grief
because
when
she
has
gone
no
more
elves
come
down
from
the
sky
for
you
at
any
rate
good
things
may
come
for
others
but
for
the
heavens
are
empty
lorimer
was
silent
looking
at
the
speaker
curiously
how
do
you
get
all
this
nonsense
into
your
head
eh
he
inquired
kindly
i
do
not
know
replied
sigurd
with
a
sigh
it
comes
but
tell
me
and
he
smiled
wistfully
it
is
true
dear
friend
good
friend
it
is
all
true
is
it
not
for
you
the
heavens
are
empty
you
know
it
lorimer
flushed
hotly
and
then
grew
strangely
pale
after
a
pause
he
said
in
his
usual
indolent
way
look
here
sigurd
you
romantic
i
not
i
know
nothing
about
elves
or
empty
heavens
i
all
right
do
you
bother
yourself
about
me
the
dwarf
studied
his
face
attentively
and
a
smile
of
almost
fiendish
cunning
suddenly
illumined
his
thin
features
he
laid
his
white
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
and
said
in
a
lower
tone
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
kill
him
the
last
two
words
were
uttered
with
such
intensity
of
meaning
that
lorimer
positively
recoiled
from
the
accents
and
the
terrible
look
which
accompanied
them
i
say
sigurd
this
wo
do
he
remonstrated
gravely
you
talk
about
killing
you
know
it
not
good
for
you
people
do
kill
each
other
nowadays
so
easily
as
you
seem
to
think
it
ca
be
done
sigurd
nobody
wants
to
do
it
it
be
done
reiterated
the
dwarf
imperatively
it
be
done
and
either
you
or
i
will
do
it
he
shall
not
rob
us
he
shall
not
steal
the
treasure
of
the
golden
midnight
he
shall
not
gather
the
rose
of
all
roses
stop
said
lorimer
suddenly
who
are
you
talking
about
who
cried
sigurd
excitedly
surely
you
know
of
him
that
tall
proud
englishman
your
foe
your
rival
the
rich
cruel
errington
lorimer
hand
fell
heavily
on
his
shoulder
and
his
voice
was
very
stern
what
nonsense
sigurd
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
errington
my
foe
good
heavens
why
he
my
best
friend
do
you
hear
sigurd
stared
up
at
him
in
vacant
surprise
but
nodded
feebly
well
mind
you
remember
it
the
spirits
tell
lies
my
boy
if
they
say
that
he
is
my
enemy
i
would
give
my
life
to
save
his
he
spoke
quietly
and
rose
from
his
seat
on
the
moss
as
he
finished
his
words
and
his
face
had
an
expression
that
was
both
noble
and
resolute
sigurd
still
gazed
upon
him
and
you
you
do
not
love
thelma
he
murmured
lorimer
started
but
controlled
himself
instantly
his
frank
english
eyes
met
the
feverishly
brilliant
ones
fixed
so
appealingly
upon
him
certainly
not
he
said
calmly
with
a
serene
smile
what
makes
you
think
of
such
a
thing
quite
wrong
sigurd
the
spirits
have
made
a
mistake
again
come
along
let
us
join
the
others
but
sigurd
would
not
accompany
him
he
sprang
away
like
a
frightened
animal
in
haste
and
abruptly
plunging
into
the
depths
of
a
wood
that
bordered
on
olaf
güldmar
grounds
was
soon
lost
to
sight
lorimer
looked
after
him
in
a
little
perplexity
i
wonder
if
he
ever
gets
dangerous
he
thought
a
fellow
with
such
queer
notions
might
do
some
serious
harm
without
meaning
it
i
keep
an
eye
on
him
and
once
or
twice
during
that
same
evening
he
felt
inclined
to
speak
to
errington
on
the
subject
but
no
suitable
opportunity
presented
itself
and
after
a
while
with
his
habitual
indolence
he
partly
forgot
the
circumstance
on
the
following
sunday
afternoon
thelma
sat
alone
under
the
wide
porch
reading
her
father
and
sigurd
accompanied
by
errington
and
his
friends
had
all
gone
for
a
mountain
ramble
promising
to
return
for
supper
a
substantial
meal
which
britta
was
already
busy
preparing
the
afternoon
was
very
warm
one
of
those
long
lazy
stretches
of
heat
and
brilliancy
in
which
nature
seems
to
have
lain
down
to
rest
like
a
child
tired
of
play
sleeping
in
the
sunshine
with
drooping
flowers
in
her
hands
the
very
ripple
of
the
stream
seemed
hushed
and
thelma
though
her
eyes
were
bent
seriously
on
the
book
she
held
sighed
once
or
twice
heavily
as
though
she
were
tired
there
was
a
change
in
the
girl
an
undefinable
something
seemed
to
have
passed
over
her
and
toned
down
the
redundant
brightness
of
her
beauty
she
was
paler
and
there
were
darker
shadows
than
usual
under
the
splendor
of
her
eyes
her
very
attitude
as
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
dark
fantastic
carving
of
the
porch
had
a
touch
of
listlessness
and
indifference
in
it
her
sweetly
arched
lips
drooped
with
a
plaintive
little
line
at
the
corners
and
her
whole
air
was
indicative
of
fatigue
mingled
with
sadness
she
looked
up
now
and
then
from
the
printed
page
and
her
gaze
wandered
over
the
stretch
of
the
scented
garden
to
the
little
silvery
glimmer
of
the
fjord
from
whence
arose
like
delicate
black
streaks
against
the
sky
the
slender
masts
of
the
and
then
she
would
resume
her
reading
with
a
slight
movement
of
impatience
the
volume
she
held
was
victor
hugo
orientales
and
though
her
sensitive
imagination
delighted
in
poetry
as
much
as
in
sunshine
she
found
it
for
once
hard
to
rivet
her
attention
as
closely
as
she
wished
to
do
on
the
exquisite
wealth
of
language
and
glow
of
color
that
distinguishes
the
writings
of
the
shakespeare
of
france
within
the
house
britta
was
singing
cheerily
at
her
work
and
the
sound
of
her
song
alone
disturbed
the
silence
two
or
three
butterflies
danced
drowsily
in
and
out
a
cluster
of
honeysuckle
that
trailed
downwards
nearly
touching
thelma
shoulder
and
a
diminutive
black
kitten
with
a
pink
ribbon
round
its
neck
sat
gravely
on
the
garden
path
washing
its
face
with
its
tiny
velvety
paws
in
that
deliberate
and
precise
fashion
common
to
the
spoiled
and
petted
members
of
its
class
everything
was
still
and
peaceful
as
became
a
sunday
afternoon
so
that
when
the
sound
of
a
heavy
advancing
footstep
disturbed
the
intense
calm
the
girl
was
almost
nervously
startled
and
rose
from
her
seat
with
so
much
precipitation
that
the
butterflies
who
had
possibly
been
considering
whether
her
hair
might
not
be
some
new
sort
of
sunflower
took
fright
and
flew
far
upwards
and
the
demure
kitten
scared
out
of
its
absurd
scrambled
hastily
up
the
nearest
little
tree
the
intruder
on
the
quietude
of
güldmar
domain
was
the
rev
dyceworthy
and
as
thelma
standing
erect
in
the
porch
beheld
him
coming
her
face
grew
stern
and
resolute
and
her
eyes
flashed
disdainfully
ignoring
the
repellant
almost
defiant
dignity
of
the
girl
attitude
dyceworthy
advanced
rather
out
of
breath
and
somewhat
heated
and
smiling
benevolently
nodded
his
head
by
way
of
greeting
without
removing
his
hat
ah
fröken
thelma
he
observed
condescendingly
and
how
are
you
you
look
remarkably
well
remarkably
so
indeed
and
he
eyed
her
with
mild
approval
i
am
well
i
thank
you
she
returned
quietly
my
father
is
not
in
mr
dyceworthy
the
reverend
charles
wiped
his
hot
face
and
his
smile
grew
wider
what
matter
he
inquired
blandly
we
shall
no
doubt
entertain
ourselves
excellently
without
him
it
is
with
you
alone
fröken
that
i
am
desirous
to
hold
converse
and
without
waiting
for
her
permission
he
entered
the
porch
and
settled
himself
comfortably
on
the
bench
opposite
to
her
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
did
so
thelma
remained
standing
and
the
lutheran
minister
covetous
eye
glanced
greedily
over
the
sweeping
curves
of
her
queenly
figure
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
her
slim
arched
throat
and
the
glitter
of
her
rich
hair
she
was
silent
and
there
was
something
in
her
manner
as
she
confronted
him
that
made
it
difficult
for
dyceworthy
to
speak
he
hummed
and
hawed
several
times
and
settled
his
stiff
collar
once
or
twice
as
though
it
hurt
him
finally
he
said
with
an
evident
effort
i
have
found
a
a
trinket
of
yours
a
trifling
toy
which
perhaps
you
would
be
glad
to
have
again
and
he
drew
carefully
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
small
parcel
wrapped
up
in
tissue
paper
which
he
undid
with
his
fat
fingers
thus
displaying
the
little
crucifix
he
had
kept
so
long
in
his
possession
concerning
this
he
went
on
holding
it
up
before
her
i
am
grievously
troubled
and
would
fain
say
a
few
necessary
words
she
interrupted
him
reaching
out
her
hand
for
the
cross
as
she
spoke
that
was
my
mother
crucifix
she
said
in
solemn
infinitely
tender
accents
with
a
mist
as
of
unshed
tears
in
her
sweet
blue
eyes
it
was
round
her
neck
when
she
died
i
knew
i
had
lost
it
and
was
very
unhappy
about
it
i
do
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
for
bringing
it
back
to
me
and
the
hauteur
of
her
face
relaxed
and
her
smile
that
sudden
sweet
smile
of
hers
shone
forth
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
athwart
a
cloud
dyceworthy
breath
came
and
went
with
curious
rapidity
his
visage
grew
pale
and
a
clammy
dew
broke
out
upon
his
forehead
he
took
the
hand
she
held
out
a
fair
soft
hand
with
a
pink
palm
like
an
upcurled
shell
and
laid
the
little
cross
within
it
and
still
retaining
his
hold
of
her
he
stammeringly
observed
then
we
are
friends
fröken
thelma
good
friends
i
hope
she
withdrew
her
fingers
quickly
from
his
hot
moist
clasp
and
her
bright
smile
vanished
i
do
not
see
that
at
all
she
replied
frigidly
friendship
is
very
rare
to
be
friends
one
must
have
similar
tastes
and
sympathies
many
things
which
we
have
not
and
which
we
shall
never
have
i
am
slow
to
call
any
person
my
friend
dyceworthy
small
pursy
mouth
drew
itself
into
a
tight
thin
line
except
he
said
with
a
suave
sneer
except
when
person
happens
to
be
a
rich
englishman
with
a
handsome
face
and
easy
manners
then
you
are
not
slow
to
make
friends
fröken
on
the
contrary
you
are
remarkably
quick
the
cold
haughty
stare
with
which
the
girl
favored
him
might
have
frozen
a
less
conceited
man
to
a
pillar
of
ice
what
do
you
mean
she
asks
abruptly
and
with
an
air
of
surprise
the
minister
little
eyes
drooped
under
their
puny
lids
and
he
fidgeted
on
the
seat
with
uncomfortable
embarrassment
he
answered
her
in
the
mildest
of
mild
voices
you
are
unlike
yourself
my
dear
fröken
he
said
with
a
soothing
gesture
of
one
of
his
white
hands
you
are
generally
frank
and
open
but
i
find
you
just
a
little
well
what
shall
i
say
secretive
yes
we
will
call
it
secretive
oh
fie
and
dyceworthy
laughed
a
gentle
little
laugh
you
must
not
pretend
ignorance
of
what
i
mean
all
the
neighborhood
is
talking
of
you
and
the
gentleman
you
are
so
often
seen
with
notably
concerning
sir
philip
errington
the
vile
tongue
of
rumor
is
busy
for
according
to
his
first
plans
when
his
yacht
arrived
here
he
was
bound
for
the
north
cape
and
should
have
gone
there
days
ago
truly
i
think
and
there
are
others
who
think
also
in
the
same
spirit
of
interest
for
you
that
the
sooner
this
young
man
leaves
our
peaceful
fjord
the
better
and
the
less
he
has
to
do
with
the
maidens
of
the
district
the
safer
we
shall
be
from
the
risk
of
scandal
and
he
heaved
a
pious
sigh
thelma
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
in
wonderment
i
do
not
understand
you
she
said
coldly
why
do
you
speak
of
no
others
are
interested
in
what
i
do
why
should
they
be
why
should
be
there
is
no
need
dyceworthy
grew
slightly
excited
he
felt
like
a
runner
nearing
the
oh
you
wrong
yourself
my
dear
fröken
he
murmured
softly
with
a
sickly
attempt
at
tenderness
in
his
tone
you
really
wrong
yourself
it
is
impossible
for
me
at
least
not
to
be
interested
in
you
even
for
our
dear
lord
sake
it
troubles
me
to
the
inmost
depths
of
my
soul
to
behold
in
you
one
of
the
foolish
virgins
whose
light
hath
been
extinguished
for
lack
of
the
saving
oil
to
see
you
wandering
as
a
lost
sheep
in
the
paths
of
darkness
and
error
without
a
hand
to
rescue
your
steps
from
the
near
and
dreadful
precipice
ay
truly
my
spirit
yearneth
for
you
as
a
mother
for
an
own
babe
fain
would
i
save
you
from
the
devices
of
the
evil
one
fain
would
i
here
the
minister
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
pressed
it
lightly
to
his
eyes
then
as
if
with
an
effort
overcoming
his
emotion
he
added
with
the
gravity
of
a
butcher
presenting
an
extortionate
bill
but
first
before
my
own
humble
desires
for
your
salvation
first
ere
i
go
further
in
converse
it
behoveth
me
to
enter
on
the
lord
business
thelma
bent
her
head
slightly
with
an
air
as
though
she
said
indeed
pray
do
not
be
long
about
it
and
leaning
back
against
the
porch
she
waited
somewhat
impatiently
the
image
i
have
just
restored
to
you
went
on
dyceworthy
in
his
most
pompous
and
ponderous
manner
you
say
belonged
to
your
unhappy
she
was
not
unhappy
interposed
the
girl
calmly
ay
ay
and
the
minister
nodded
with
a
superior
air
of
wisdom
so
you
imagine
so
you
think
you
must
have
been
too
young
to
judge
of
these
things
she
died
i
saw
her
die
again
she
interrupted
with
a
musing
tenderness
in
her
voice
she
smiled
and
kissed
me
then
she
laid
her
thin
white
hand
on
this
crucifix
and
closing
her
eyes
she
went
to
sleep
they
told
me
it
was
death
since
then
i
have
known
that
death
is
beautiful
dyceworthy
coughed
a
little
cough
of
quiet
incredulity
he
was
not
fond
of
sentiment
in
any
form
and
the
girl
dreamily
pensive
manner
annoyed
him
death
beautiful
faugh
it
was
the
one
thing
of
all
others
that
he
dreaded
it
was
an
unpleasant
necessity
concerning
which
he
thought
as
little
as
possible
though
he
preached
frequently
on
the
peace
of
the
grave
and
the
joys
of
heaven
he
was
far
from
believing
in
either
he
was
nervously
terrified
of
illness
and
fled
like
a
frightened
hare
from
the
very
rumor
of
any
infectious
disorder
and
he
had
never
been
known
to
attend
a
and
now
in
answer
to
thelma
he
nodded
piously
and
rubbed
his
hands
and
said
yes
yes
no
doubt
no
doubt
all
very
proper
on
your
part
i
am
sure
but
concerning
this
same
image
of
which
i
came
to
speak
it
is
most
imperative
that
you
should
be
brought
to
recognize
it
as
a
purely
carnal
object
unfitting
a
maiden
eyes
to
rest
upon
the
true
followers
of
the
gospel
are
those
who
strive
to
forget
the
sufferings
of
our
dear
lord
as
much
as
possible
or
to
think
of
them
only
in
spirit
the
minds
of
sinners
alas
are
easily
influenced
and
it
is
both
unseemly
and
dangerous
to
gaze
freely
upon
the
carven
semblance
of
the
lord
limbs
yea
truly
it
hath
oft
been
considered
as
damnatory
to
the
soul
more
especially
in
the
cases
of
women
immured
as
nuns
who
encourage
themselves
in
an
undue
familiarity
with
our
lord
by
gazing
long
and
earnestly
upon
his
body
nailed
to
the
accursèd
tree
here
dyceworthy
paused
for
breath
thelma
was
silent
but
a
faint
smile
gleamed
on
her
face
wherefore
he
went
on
i
do
adjure
you
as
you
desire
grace
and
redemption
to
utterly
cast
from
you
the
vile
trinket
i
have
heaven
knows
how
reluctantly
returned
to
your
keeping
to
trample
upon
it
and
renounce
it
as
a
device
of
satan
he
stopped
surprised
and
indignant
as
she
raised
the
emblem
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
reverently
it
is
the
sign
of
peace
and
salvation
she
said
steadily
to
me
at
least
you
waste
your
words
dyceworthy
i
am
a
catholic
oh
say
not
so
exclaimed
the
minister
now
thoroughly
roused
to
a
pitch
of
unctuous
enthusiasm
say
not
so
poor
child
who
knowest
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
used
catholic
signifies
universal
god
forbid
a
universal
papacy
you
are
not
a
catholic
no
you
are
a
roman
by
which
name
we
understand
all
that
is
most
loathsome
and
unpleasing
unto
god
but
i
will
wrestle
for
your
soul
yea
night
and
day
will
i
bend
my
spiritual
sinews
to
the
task
i
will
obtain
the
victory
i
will
exorcise
the
fiend
alas
alas
you
are
on
the
brink
of
hell
think
of
it
and
dyceworthy
stretched
out
his
hand
with
his
favorite
pulpit
gesture
think
of
the
roasting
and
burning
the
scorching
and
withering
of
souls
imagine
if
you
can
the
hopeless
bitter
eternal
damnation
and
here
he
smacked
his
lips
as
though
he
were
tasting
something
excellent
from
which
there
is
no
escape
for
which
there
shall
be
no
remedy
it
is
a
gloomy
picture
said
thelma
with
a
quiet
sparkle
in
her
eye
i
am
sorry
for
but
i
am
happier
my
faith
teaches
of
purgatory
there
is
always
a
little
hope
there
is
none
there
is
none
exclaimed
the
minister
rising
in
excitement
from
his
seat
and
swaying
ponderously
to
and
fro
as
he
gesticulated
with
hands
and
head
you
are
doomed
doomed
there
is
no
middle
course
between
hell
and
heaven
it
must
be
one
thing
or
the
other
god
deals
not
in
pause
oh
pause
ere
you
decide
to
fall
even
at
the
latest
hour
the
lord
desires
to
save
your
soul
the
lord
yearns
for
your
redemption
and
maketh
me
to
yearn
also
fröken
thelma
and
dyceworthy
voice
deepened
in
solemnity
there
is
a
way
which
the
lord
hath
whispered
in
mine
ears
a
way
that
pointeth
to
the
white
robe
and
the
crown
of
glory
a
way
by
which
you
shall
possess
the
inner
peace
of
the
heart
with
bliss
on
earth
as
the
forerunner
of
bliss
in
heaven
she
looked
at
him
steadfastly
and
that
way
is
what
she
inquired
dyceworthy
hesitated
and
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
this
girl
was
not
so
thoroughly
any
sign
of
timidity
in
her
would
have
given
him
an
increase
of
hardihood
but
her
eyes
were
coldly
brilliant
and
glanced
him
over
without
the
smallest
embarrassment
he
took
refuge
in
his
remedy
his
benevolent
smile
a
smile
that
covered
a
multitude
of
hypocrisies
you
ask
a
plain
question
fröken
he
said
sweetly
and
i
should
be
loth
not
to
give
you
a
plain
answer
that
way
that
glorious
way
of
salvation
for
you
is
through
and
his
countenance
shone
with
smug
as
he
spoke
and
he
repeated
softly
yes
yes
that
way
is
through
me
she
moved
with
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
it
is
a
pity
to
talk
any
more
she
said
rather
wearily
it
is
all
no
use
why
do
you
wish
to
change
me
in
my
religion
i
do
not
wish
to
change
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
speak
of
such
things
at
all
of
course
replied
dyceworthy
blandly
of
course
you
do
not
see
and
why
because
you
are
blind
here
he
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
looked
covetously
at
the
curve
of
her
full
firm
waist
oh
why
he
resumed
in
a
sort
of
rapture
why
should
we
say
it
is
a
pity
to
talk
any
more
why
should
we
say
it
is
all
no
use
it
of
use
it
is
noble
it
is
edifying
to
converse
of
the
lord
good
pleasure
and
what
is
his
good
pleasure
at
this
moment
to
unite
two
souls
in
his
service
yea
he
hath
turned
my
desire
towards
you
fröken
thelma
even
as
jacob
desire
was
towards
rachel
let
me
see
this
hand
he
made
a
furtive
grab
at
the
white
taper
fingers
that
played
listlessly
with
the
jessamine
leaves
on
the
porch
but
the
girl
dexterously
withdrew
them
from
his
clutch
and
moved
a
little
further
back
her
face
flushing
proudly
oh
will
it
not
come
to
me
cruel
hand
and
he
rolled
his
little
eyes
with
an
absurdly
sentimental
air
of
reproach
it
is
shy
it
will
not
clasp
the
hand
of
its
protector
do
not
be
afraid
fröken
i
charles
dyceworthy
am
not
the
man
to
trifle
with
your
young
affections
let
them
rest
where
they
have
flown
i
accept
them
yea
in
spite
of
wrath
and
error
and
moral
destitution
my
spirit
inclineth
towards
you
in
the
language
of
carnal
men
i
love
you
more
than
this
i
am
willing
to
take
you
as
my
lawful
wife
he
broke
off
abruptly
somewhat
startled
at
the
bitter
scorn
of
the
flashing
eyes
that
like
two
quivering
stars
were
blazing
upon
him
her
voice
clear
as
a
bell
ringing
in
frosty
air
cut
through
the
silence
like
a
sweep
of
a
how
dare
you
she
said
with
a
wrathful
thrill
in
her
low
intense
tones
how
dare
you
come
here
to
insult
me
insult
her
he
the
reverend
charles
dyceworthy
considered
guilty
of
insult
in
offering
honorable
marriage
to
a
mere
farmer
daughter
he
could
not
believe
his
own
ears
and
in
his
astonishment
he
looked
up
at
her
looking
he
recoiled
and
shrank
into
himself
like
a
convicted
knave
before
some
queenly
accuser
the
whole
form
of
the
girl
seemed
to
dilate
with
indignation
from
her
proud
mouth
arched
like
a
bow
sprang
barbed
arrows
of
scorn
that
flew
straightly
and
struck
home
always
i
have
guessed
what
you
wanted
she
went
on
in
that
deep
vibrating
tone
which
had
such
a
rich
quiver
of
anger
within
it
but
i
never
thought
you
would
she
paused
and
a
little
disdainful
laugh
broke
from
her
lips
you
would
make
your
wife
you
think
likely
to
accept
such
an
offer
and
she
drew
herself
up
with
a
superb
gesture
and
regarded
him
fixedly
oh
pride
pride
murmured
the
unabashed
dyceworthy
recovering
from
the
momentary
abasement
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
her
look
and
manner
how
it
overcometh
our
natures
and
mastereth
our
spirits
my
dear
my
dearest
fröken
i
fear
you
do
not
understand
me
yet
it
is
natural
that
you
should
not
you
were
not
prepared
for
the
offer
of
my
my
affections
and
he
beamed
all
over
with
benevolence
and
i
can
appreciate
a
maidenly
and
becoming
coyness
even
though
it
assume
the
form
of
a
repellant
and
unreasonable
anger
but
take
courage
my
my
dear
girl
our
lord
forbid
that
i
should
wantonly
play
with
the
delicate
emotions
of
your
heart
poor
little
heart
does
it
flutter
and
dyceworthy
leered
sweetly
i
will
give
it
time
to
recover
itself
yes
yes
a
little
time
and
then
you
will
put
that
pretty
hand
in
mine
here
he
drew
nearer
to
her
and
with
one
kiss
we
will
seal
the
compact
and
he
attempted
to
steal
his
arm
round
her
waist
but
the
girl
sprang
back
indignantly
and
pulling
down
a
thick
branch
of
the
clambering
prickly
roses
from
the
porch
held
it
in
front
of
her
by
way
of
protection
dyceworthy
laughed
indulgently
very
pretty
very
pretty
indeed
he
mildly
observed
eyeing
her
as
she
stood
at
bay
barricaded
by
the
roses
quite
a
picture
there
there
do
not
be
frightened
such
shyness
is
very
natural
we
will
embrace
in
the
lord
another
day
in
the
meantime
one
little
word
word
will
suffice
me
yea
even
one
little
smile
to
show
me
that
you
understand
my
words
that
you
love
me
here
he
clasped
his
plump
hands
together
in
flabby
ecstasy
even
as
you
are
loved
his
absurd
attitude
the
weak
manner
in
which
his
clumsy
legs
seemed
from
the
force
of
sheer
sentiment
to
bend
under
his
weighty
body
and
the
inanely
amatory
expression
of
his
puffy
countenance
would
have
excited
most
women
to
laughter
and
thelma
was
perfectly
conscious
of
his
utterly
ridiculous
appearance
but
she
was
too
thoroughly
indignant
to
take
the
matter
in
a
humorous
light
love
you
she
exclaimed
with
a
movement
of
irrepressible
loathing
you
must
be
mad
i
would
rather
die
than
marry
you
dyceworthy
face
grew
livid
and
his
little
eyes
sparkled
vindictively
but
he
restrained
his
inward
rage
and
merely
smiled
rubbing
his
hands
softly
one
against
the
other
let
us
be
calm
he
said
soothingly
whatever
we
do
let
us
be
calm
let
us
not
provoke
one
another
to
wrath
above
all
things
let
us
in
a
spirit
of
charity
and
patience
reason
out
this
matter
without
undue
excitement
my
ears
have
most
painfully
heard
your
last
words
which
taken
literally
might
mean
that
you
reject
my
honorable
offer
the
question
is
they
mean
this
i
can
not
i
will
not
believe
that
you
would
foolishly
stand
in
the
way
of
your
own
salvation
and
he
shook
his
head
with
doleful
gentleness
moreover
fröken
thelma
though
it
sorely
distresses
me
to
speak
of
it
it
is
my
duty
as
a
minister
of
the
lord
to
remind
you
that
an
honest
marriage
a
marriage
of
virtue
and
respectability
such
as
i
propose
is
the
only
way
to
restore
your
reputation
which
alas
is
sorely
damaged
and
dyceworthy
stopped
abruptly
a
little
alarmed
as
she
suddenly
cast
aside
the
barrier
of
roses
and
advanced
toward
him
her
blue
eyes
blazing
my
reputation
she
said
haughtily
who
speaks
of
it
oh
dear
dear
me
moaned
the
minister
pathetically
sad
very
sad
to
see
so
ungovernable
a
temper
so
wild
and
untrained
a
disposition
alas
alas
how
frail
we
are
without
the
support
without
the
strong
staff
of
the
lord
mercy
to
lean
upon
not
i
my
poor
child
not
i
but
the
whole
village
speaks
of
you
to
you
the
ignorant
people
attribute
all
the
sundry
evils
that
of
late
have
fallen
sorely
upon
them
bad
harvests
with
the
fishing
poverty
sickness
here
dyceworthy
pressed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
delicately
together
and
looked
at
her
with
a
benevolent
compassion
and
they
call
it
witchcraft
yes
strange
very
strange
but
so
it
is
ignorant
as
they
are
such
ignorance
is
not
easily
enlightened
and
though
i
he
sighed
have
done
my
poor
best
to
disabuse
their
minds
of
the
suspicions
against
you
i
find
it
is
a
matter
in
which
i
though
a
humble
mouthpiece
of
the
gospel
am
powerless
quite
powerless
she
relaxed
her
defiant
attitude
and
moved
away
from
him
the
shadow
of
a
smile
was
on
her
lips
it
is
not
my
fault
if
the
people
are
foolish
she
said
coldly
i
have
never
done
harm
to
any
one
that
i
know
of
and
turning
abruptly
she
seemed
about
to
enter
the
house
but
the
minister
dexterously
placed
himself
in
her
way
and
barred
her
passage
stay
oh
stay
he
exclaimed
with
unctuous
fervor
pause
unfortunate
girl
ere
you
reject
the
strong
shield
and
buckler
that
the
lord
has
in
his
great
mercy
offered
you
in
my
person
for
i
must
warn
you
fröken
thelma
i
must
warn
you
seriously
of
the
danger
you
run
i
will
not
pain
you
by
referring
to
the
grave
charges
brought
against
your
father
who
is
alas
in
spite
of
my
spiritual
wrestling
with
the
lord
for
his
sake
still
no
better
than
a
heathen
savage
no
i
will
say
nothing
of
this
but
what
what
shall
i
say
here
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
tone
of
mysterious
and
weighty
reproach
what
shall
i
say
of
your
most
unseemly
and
indiscreet
companionship
with
these
worldly
young
men
who
are
visiting
the
fjord
for
their
idle
pastime
ah
dear
dear
this
is
indeed
a
heavy
scandal
and
a
sore
burden
to
my
soul
for
up
to
this
time
i
have
in
spite
of
many
faults
in
your
disposition
considered
you
were
at
least
of
a
most
maidenly
and
decorous
deportment
but
now
now
to
think
that
you
should
of
your
own
free
will
and
choice
consent
to
be
the
plaything
of
this
idle
stroller
from
the
wicked
haunts
of
fashion
the
hour
toy
of
this
sir
philip
errington
fröken
thelma
i
would
never
have
believed
it
of
you
and
he
drew
himself
up
with
ponderous
and
sorrowful
dignity
a
burning
blush
had
covered
thelma
face
at
the
mention
of
name
but
it
soon
faded
leaving
her
very
pale
she
changed
her
position
so
that
she
confronted
dyceworthy
her
clear
blue
eyes
regarded
him
steadfastly
is
this
what
is
said
of
me
she
asked
calmly
it
is
it
is
most
unfortunately
returned
the
minister
shaking
his
head
a
great
many
times
then
with
a
sort
of
elephantine
cheerfulness
he
added
but
what
matter
there
is
time
to
remedy
these
things
i
am
willing
to
set
myself
as
a
strong
barrier
against
the
evil
noises
of
rumor
am
i
selfish
or
ungenerous
the
lord
forbid
it
no
matter
how
am
compromised
no
matter
how
am
misjudged
i
am
still
willing
to
take
you
as
my
lawful
wife
fröken
thelma
but
and
here
he
shook
his
forefinger
at
her
with
a
pretended
playfulness
i
will
permit
no
more
converse
with
sir
philip
errington
no
no
i
can
not
allow
it
i
can
not
indeed
she
still
looked
straight
at
him
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
rapidly
with
her
passionate
breath
and
there
was
such
an
eloquent
breath
of
scorn
in
her
face
that
he
winced
under
it
as
though
struck
by
a
sharp
scourge
you
are
not
worth
my
anger
she
said
slowly
this
time
without
a
tremor
in
her
rich
voice
one
must
have
something
to
be
angry
with
and
you
you
are
nothing
neither
man
nor
beast
for
men
are
brave
and
beasts
tell
no
lies
your
wife
i
and
she
laughed
aloud
then
with
a
gesture
of
command
go
she
exclaimed
and
never
let
me
see
your
face
again
the
clear
scornful
laughter
the
air
of
absolute
authority
with
which
she
spoke
would
have
stung
the
most
of
men
even
though
his
conscience
were
enveloped
in
a
moral
leather
casing
of
hypocrisy
and
arrogance
and
notwithstanding
his
invariable
air
of
mildness
dyceworthy
had
a
temper
that
temper
rose
to
a
white
heat
just
now
every
drop
of
blood
receded
from
his
countenance
and
his
soft
hands
clenched
themselves
in
a
particularly
ugly
and
threatening
manner
yet
he
managed
to
preserve
his
suave
composure
alas
alas
he
murmured
how
sorely
my
soul
is
afflicted
to
see
you
thus
fröken
i
am
amazed
i
am
distressed
such
language
from
your
lips
oh
fie
fie
and
has
it
come
to
this
and
must
i
resign
the
hope
i
had
of
saving
your
poor
soul
and
must
i
withdraw
my
spiritual
protection
from
you
this
he
asked
with
a
suggestive
sneer
of
his
prim
mouth
and
then
continued
i
must
alas
i
must
my
conscience
will
not
permit
me
to
do
more
than
pray
for
you
and
as
is
my
duty
i
shall
in
a
spirit
of
forbearance
and
charity
speak
warningly
to
sir
philip
concerning
but
thelma
did
not
permit
him
to
finish
his
sentence
she
sprang
forward
like
a
young
leopardess
and
with
a
magnificent
outward
sweep
of
her
arm
motioned
him
down
the
garden
path
out
of
my
sight
she
cried
and
then
stood
waiting
for
him
to
obey
her
her
whole
frame
vibrating
with
indignation
like
a
harp
struck
too
roughly
she
looked
so
terribly
beautiful
and
there
was
such
a
suggestive
power
in
that
extended
bare
white
arm
of
hers
that
the
minister
though
quaking
from
head
to
heel
with
disappointment
and
resentment
judged
it
prudent
to
leave
her
certainly
i
will
take
my
departure
fröken
he
said
meekly
while
his
teeth
glimmered
wolfishly
through
his
pale
lips
in
a
snarl
more
than
a
smile
it
is
best
you
should
be
alone
to
recover
yourself
from
this
this
undue
excitement
i
shall
not
repeat
my
my
offer
but
i
am
sure
your
good
sense
will
in
time
show
you
how
very
unjust
and
hasty
you
have
been
in
this
matter
and
and
you
will
be
sorry
yes
indeed
i
am
quite
sure
you
will
be
sorry
i
wish
you
good
day
fröken
thelma
she
made
him
no
reply
and
he
turned
from
the
house
and
left
her
strolling
down
the
path
as
though
he
were
in
the
best
of
all
possible
moods
with
himself
and
the
universe
but
in
truth
he
muttered
a
heavy
oath
under
his
breath
an
oath
that
was
by
no
means
in
keeping
with
his
godly
and
peaceful
disposition
once
as
he
walked
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
woman
he
coveted
now
more
than
ever
standing
erect
in
the
porch
tall
fair
and
loyal
in
her
attitude
looking
like
some
proud
empress
who
had
just
dismissed
an
unworthy
vassal
a
daughter
and
she
had
refused
dyceworthy
with
disdain
he
had
much
ado
to
prevent
himself
shaking
his
fist
at
her
the
lofty
shall
be
laid
low
and
the
shall
be
humbled
he
thought
as
with
a
vicious
switch
of
his
stick
he
struck
off
a
fragrant
head
of
purple
clover
conceited
fool
of
a
girl
hopes
to
be
does
she
she
had
better
take
care
here
he
stopped
abruptly
in
his
walk
as
if
a
thought
had
struck
him
a
malignant
joy
sparkled
in
his
eyes
and
he
flourished
his
stick
triumphantly
in
the
air
i
have
her
yet
he
exclaimed
i
set
lovisa
on
her
and
his
countenance
cleared
he
quickened
his
pace
like
a
man
having
some
pressing
business
to
fulfill
and
was
soon
in
his
boat
rowing
towards
bosekop
with
unaccustomed
speed
and
energy
meanwhile
thelma
stood
motionless
where
he
had
left
her
she
watched
the
retreating
form
of
her
portly
suitor
till
he
had
altogether
disappeared
then
she
pressed
one
hand
on
her
bosom
sighed
and
laughed
a
little
glancing
at
the
crucifix
so
lately
restored
to
her
she
touched
it
with
her
lips
and
fastened
it
to
a
small
silver
chain
she
wore
and
then
a
shadow
swept
over
her
fair
face
that
made
it
strangely
sad
and
weary
her
lips
quivered
pathetically
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
curved
fingers
as
though
the
sunlight
hurt
her
then
with
faltering
steps
she
turned
away
from
the
warm
stretch
of
garden
brilliant
with
blossom
and
entered
the
house
there
was
a
sense
of
outrage
and
insult
upon
her
and
though
in
her
soul
she
treated
observations
with
the
contempt
they
deserved
his
coarse
allusion
to
sir
philip
errington
had
wounded
her
more
than
she
cared
to
admit
to
herself
once
in
the
quiet
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
her
father
and
laying
her
proud
little
golden
head
down
on
her
folded
arms
she
broke
into
a
passion
of
silent
tears
who
shall
unravel
the
mystery
of
a
woman
weeping
who
shall
declare
whether
it
is
a
pain
or
a
relief
to
the
overcharged
heart
the
dignity
of
a
crowned
queen
is
capable
of
utterly
dissolving
and
disappearing
in
a
shower
of
tears
when
love
burning
finger
touches
the
pulse
and
marks
its
slow
or
rapid
beatings
and
thelma
wept
as
many
of
her
sex
weep
without
knowing
why
save
that
all
suddenly
she
felt
herself
most
lonely
and
forlorn
like

chapter

a
wicked
will
a
woman
will
a
cankered
grandame
will
by
jove
and
lorimer
after
uttering
this
unmeaning
exclamation
was
silent
out
of
sheer
dismay
he
stood
hesitating
and
looking
in
at
the
door
of
the
güldmar
and
the
alarming
spectacle
he
saw
was
the
queenly
thelma
down
on
the
floor
in
an
attitude
of
grief
thelma
giving
way
to
little
smothered
sobs
of
distress
thelma
actually
crying
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
stared
utterly
bewildered
it
was
a
sight
for
which
he
was
unprepared
he
was
not
accustomed
to
women
tears
what
should
he
do
should
he
cough
gently
to
attract
her
attention
or
should
he
retire
on
and
leave
her
to
indulge
her
grief
as
long
as
she
would
without
making
any
attempt
to
console
her
the
latter
course
seemed
almost
brutal
yet
he
was
nearly
deciding
upon
it
when
a
slight
creak
of
the
door
against
which
he
leaned
caused
her
to
look
up
suddenly
seeing
him
she
rose
quickly
from
her
desponding
position
and
faced
him
her
cheeks
somewhat
deeply
flushed
and
her
eyes
glittering
feverishly
mr
lorimer
she
exclaimed
forcing
a
faint
smile
to
her
quivering
lips
you
here
why
where
are
the
others
they
are
coming
on
after
me
replied
lorimer
advancing
into
the
room
and
diplomatically
ignoring
the
girl
efforts
to
hide
the
tears
that
still
threatened
to
have
their
way
but
i
was
sent
in
advance
to
tell
you
not
to
be
frightened
there
has
been
a
slight
accident
she
grew
very
pale
is
it
my
father
she
asked
tremblingly
sir
philip
no
no
answered
lorimer
reassuringly
it
is
nothing
serious
really
upon
my
honor
your
father
all
right
so
is
phil
our
lively
friend
pierre
is
the
victim
the
fact
is
we
had
some
trouble
with
sigurd
i
ca
think
what
has
come
to
the
boy
he
was
as
amiable
as
possible
when
we
started
but
after
we
had
climbed
about
up
the
mountain
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
throw
stones
about
rather
recklessly
it
was
only
fun
he
said
your
father
tried
to
make
him
leave
off
but
he
was
obstinate
at
last
in
a
particularly
bright
access
of
playfulness
he
got
hold
of
a
large
flint
and
nearly
put
phil
eye
out
with
it
phil
dodged
it
and
it
flew
straight
at
duprèz
splitting
open
his
cheek
in
rather
an
unbecoming
fashion
do
look
so
horrified
miss
güldmar
it
is
really
nothing
oh
but
indeed
it
is
something
she
said
with
true
womanly
anxiety
in
her
voice
poor
fellow
i
am
so
sorry
is
he
much
hurt
does
he
suffer
pierre
oh
no
not
a
bit
of
it
he
as
jolly
as
possible
we
bandaged
him
up
in
a
very
artistic
fashion
he
looks
quite
interesting
i
assure
you
his
beauty
spoilt
for
a
time
that
all
phil
thought
you
might
be
alarmed
when
you
saw
us
bringing
home
the
wounded
that
is
why
i
came
on
to
tell
you
all
about
it
but
what
can
be
the
matter
with
sigurd
asked
the
girl
raising
her
hand
furtively
to
dash
off
a
few
that
still
hung
on
her
long
lashes
and
where
is
he
ah
that
i
ca
tell
you
answered
lorimer
he
is
perfectly
incomprehensible
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
blood
flowing
from
duprèz
cheek
he
tittered
a
howl
as
if
some
one
had
shot
him
and
away
he
rushed
into
the
woods
as
fast
as
he
could
go
we
called
him
and
shouted
his
name
till
we
were
hoarse
all
no
use
he
would
come
back
i
suppose
he
find
his
way
home
by
himself
oh
yes
said
thelma
gravely
but
when
he
comes
i
will
scold
him
very
much
it
is
not
like
him
to
be
so
wild
and
cruel
he
will
understand
me
when
i
tell
him
how
wrong
he
has
been
oh
do
break
his
heart
poor
little
chap
said
lorimer
easily
your
father
has
given
him
a
terrible
scolding
already
he
has
got
his
wits
about
him
you
know
he
ca
help
being
queer
sometimes
but
what
have
been
doing
with
yourself
during
our
absence
and
he
regarded
her
with
friendly
scrutiny
you
were
crying
when
i
came
in
now
were
you
she
met
his
gaze
quite
frankly
yes
she
replied
with
a
plaintive
thrill
in
her
voice
i
could
not
help
it
my
heart
ached
and
the
tears
came
somehow
i
felt
that
everything
was
wrong
and
that
it
was
all
my
fault
your
fault
murmured
lorimer
astonished
my
dear
miss
güldmar
what
do
you
mean
what
your
fault
everything
she
answered
sadly
with
a
deep
sigh
i
am
very
foolish
and
i
am
sure
i
often
do
wrong
without
meaning
it
dyceworthy
has
been
here
and
she
stopped
abruptly
and
a
wave
of
color
flushed
her
face
lorimer
laughed
lightly
dyceworthy
he
exclaimed
the
mystery
is
explained
you
have
been
bored
by
good
religious
as
pierre
calls
him
you
know
what
means
now
miss
güldmar
do
you
she
smiled
slightly
and
nodded
the
first
time
you
visited
the
you
did
understand
the
word
i
remember
ah
and
he
shook
his
head
if
you
were
in
london
society
you
find
that
expression
very
convenient
it
would
come
to
your
lips
pretty
frequently
i
can
tell
you
i
shall
never
see
london
she
said
with
a
sort
of
resigned
air
you
will
all
go
away
very
soon
and
i
i
shall
be
lonely
she
bit
her
lips
in
quick
vexation
as
her
blue
eyes
filled
again
with
tears
in
spite
of
herself
lorimer
turned
away
and
pulled
a
chair
to
the
open
window
come
and
sit
down
here
he
said
invitingly
we
shall
be
able
to
see
the
others
coming
down
the
hill
nothing
like
fresh
air
for
blowing
away
the
blues
then
as
she
obeyed
him
he
added
what
has
dyceworthy
been
saying
to
you
he
told
me
i
was
wicked
she
murmured
and
that
all
the
people
here
think
very
badly
of
me
but
that
was
not
the
worst
and
a
little
shudder
passed
over
her
there
was
something
else
something
that
made
me
very
angry
so
angry
and
here
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
gravely
penitent
air
lorimer
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
had
so
bad
and
fierce
a
temper
before
good
gracious
exclaimed
lorimer
with
a
broad
smile
you
alarm
me
miss
güldmar
i
had
no
idea
you
were
a
fierce
person
i
shall
get
afraid
of
you
i
shall
really
ah
you
laugh
and
she
spoke
you
will
not
be
serious
for
one
little
moment
yes
i
will
now
look
at
me
and
he
assumed
a
solemn
expression
and
drew
himself
up
with
an
air
of
dignity
i
am
all
attention
consider
me
your
miss
güldmar
and
explain
the
reason
of
this
fierce
temper
of
yours
she
peeped
at
him
shyly
from
under
her
silken
lashes
it
is
more
dreadful
than
you
think
she
answered
in
a
low
tone
dyceworthy
asked
me
to
marry
him
lorimer
keen
eyes
flashed
with
indignation
this
was
beyond
a
jest
and
he
clenched
his
fist
as
he
exclaimed
impudent
donkey
what
a
jolly
good
thrashing
he
deserves
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
got
it
one
of
these
days
and
so
miss
güldmar
and
he
studied
her
face
with
some
solicitude
you
were
very
angry
with
him
oh
yes
she
replied
but
when
i
told
him
he
was
a
coward
and
that
he
must
go
away
he
said
some
very
cruel
things
she
stopped
and
blushed
deeply
then
as
if
seized
by
some
sudden
impulse
she
laid
her
small
hand
on
lorimer
and
said
in
the
tone
of
an
appealing
child
you
are
very
good
and
kind
to
me
and
you
are
clever
you
know
so
much
more
than
i
do
you
must
help
me
you
will
tell
me
will
you
not
if
it
is
wrong
of
me
to
like
you
all
it
is
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
a
long
time
and
i
have
been
very
happy
with
you
and
your
friends
but
you
must
teach
me
to
behave
like
the
girls
you
have
seen
in
london
for
i
could
not
bear
that
sir
philip
should
think
me
wicked
wicked
and
lorimer
drew
a
long
breath
good
heavens
if
you
knew
what
phil
ideas
about
you
are
miss
güldmar
i
do
not
wish
to
know
interrupted
thelma
steadily
you
must
quite
understand
me
i
am
not
clever
to
hide
my
thoughts
and
and
are
glad
when
you
talk
sometimes
to
sir
philip
are
you
not
he
nodded
gravely
studying
every
light
and
shadow
on
the
fair
upturned
innocent
face
yes
she
continued
with
some
eagerness
i
see
you
are
well
it
is
the
same
with
me
i
do
love
to
hear
him
speak
you
know
how
his
voice
is
like
music
and
how
his
kind
ways
warm
the
heart
it
is
pleasant
to
be
in
his
company
i
am
sure
you
also
find
it
so
but
for
me
it
seems
it
is
wrong
it
is
not
wise
for
me
to
show
when
i
am
happy
i
do
not
care
what
other
people
say
but
i
would
not
have
think
ill
of
me
for
all
the
world
lorimer
took
her
hand
and
held
it
in
his
with
a
most
tender
loyalty
and
respect
her
naïve
simple
words
had
all
unconsciously
to
herself
laid
bare
the
secret
of
her
soul
to
his
eyes
and
though
his
heart
beat
with
a
strange
sickening
sense
of
unrest
that
flavored
of
despair
a
gentle
reverence
filled
him
such
as
a
man
might
feel
if
some
little
shrine
sacred
to
purity
and
peace
should
be
suddenly
unveiled
before
him
my
dear
miss
güldmar
he
said
earnestly
i
assure
you
you
have
no
cause
to
be
uneasy
you
must
not
believe
a
word
dyceworthy
says
every
one
with
a
grain
of
common
sense
can
see
what
a
liar
and
hypocrite
he
is
and
as
for
you
you
never
do
anything
wrong
do
imagine
such
nonsense
i
wish
there
were
more
women
like
you
ah
that
is
very
kind
of
you
half
laughed
the
girl
still
allowing
her
hand
to
rest
in
his
but
i
do
not
think
everybody
would
have
such
a
good
opinion
they
both
started
and
their
hands
fell
asunder
as
a
shadow
darkened
the
room
and
sir
philip
stood
before
them
excuse
me
he
said
stiffly
lifting
his
hat
with
ceremonious
politeness
i
ought
to
have
knocked
at
the
door
i
why
asked
thelma
raising
her
eyebrows
in
surprise
yes
why
indeed
echoed
lorimer
with
a
frank
look
at
his
friend
i
am
afraid
and
for
once
the
generally
errington
looked
positively
petulant
i
am
afraid
i
interrupted
a
pleasant
conversation
and
he
gave
a
little
forced
laugh
of
feigned
amusement
but
evident
vexation
and
if
it
was
pleasant
shall
you
not
make
it
still
more
so
asked
thelma
with
timid
and
bewitching
sweetness
though
her
heart
beat
very
fast
she
was
anxious
why
was
sir
philip
so
cold
and
distant
he
looked
at
her
and
his
passion
leaped
to
his
eyes
and
filled
them
with
a
glowing
and
fiery
tenderness
her
head
drooped
suddenly
and
she
turned
quickly
to
avoid
that
searching
longing
gaze
lorimer
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
slight
feeling
of
amusement
well
phil
he
inquired
lazily
how
did
you
get
here
so
soon
you
must
have
glided
into
the
garden
like
a
ghost
for
i
never
heard
you
coming
so
i
imagine
retorted
errington
with
an
effort
to
be
sarcastic
in
which
he
utterly
failed
as
he
met
his
friend
eyes
then
after
a
slight
and
somewhat
embarrassed
pause
he
added
more
mildly
duprèz
can
not
get
on
very
fast
his
wound
still
bleeds
and
he
feels
rather
faint
now
and
then
i
do
think
we
bandaged
him
up
properly
and
i
came
on
to
see
if
britta
could
prepare
something
for
him
but
you
will
not
need
to
ask
britta
said
thelma
quietly
with
a
pretty
air
of
authority
for
i
shall
myself
do
all
for
duprèz
i
understand
well
how
to
cure
his
wound
and
i
do
think
he
will
like
me
as
well
as
britta
and
hearing
footsteps
approaching
she
looked
out
at
the
window
here
they
come
she
exclaimed
ah
poor
monsieur
pierre
he
does
look
very
pale
i
will
go
and
meet
them
and
she
hurried
from
the
room
leaving
the
two
young
men
together
errington
threw
himself
into
olaf
güldmar
great
with
a
slight
sigh
well
said
lorimer
inquiringly
well
he
returned
somewhat
gruffly
lorimer
laughed
and
crossing
the
room
approached
him
and
clapped
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
look
here
old
man
he
said
earnestly
do
be
a
fool
i
know
that
maketh
men
mad
but
i
never
supposed
the
lunacy
would
lead
you
to
the
undesirable
point
of
distrusting
your
friend
your
true
friend
phil
by
all
the
gods
of
the
past
and
present
and
he
laughed
again
a
little
huskily
this
time
for
there
was
a
sudden
unaccountable
and
lump
in
his
throat
and
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
which
he
had
not
bargained
for
philip
looked
up
and
silently
held
out
his
hand
which
lorimer
as
silently
clasped
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
and
then
the
young
baronet
spoke
out
manfully
i
ashamed
of
myself
george
i
really
am
but
i
tell
you
when
i
came
in
and
saw
you
two
standing
there
you
no
idea
what
a
picture
you
made
by
jove
i
was
furious
and
he
smiled
i
suppose
i
was
jealous
i
suppose
you
were
returned
lorimer
amusedly
novel
sensation
is
it
a
sort
of
hot
prickly
sort
of
thing
must
be
frightfully
exhausting
but
why
you
should
indulge
this
emotion
at
expense
is
what
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
understand
well
murmured
errington
rather
abashed
you
see
her
hands
were
in
yours
as
they
will
be
again
and
yet
again
i
trust
said
lorimer
with
cheery
fervor
surely
you
allow
me
to
shake
hands
with
your
wife
i
say
george
be
quiet
exclaimed
philip
warningly
as
at
that
moment
thelma
passed
the
window
with
pierre
duprèz
leaning
on
her
arm
and
her
father
and
macfarlane
following
she
entered
the
room
with
the
stately
step
of
a
young
queen
her
tall
beautiful
figure
forming
a
strong
contrast
to
that
of
the
little
frenchman
upon
whom
she
smiled
down
with
an
air
of
almost
maternal
protection
you
will
sit
here
monsieur
duprèz
she
said
leading
him
to
the
which
errington
instantly
vacated
and
father
will
bring
you
a
good
glass
of
wine
and
the
pain
will
be
nothing
when
i
have
attended
to
that
cruel
wound
but
i
am
so
sorry
so
very
sorry
to
see
you
suffer
pierre
did
indeed
present
rather
a
dismal
spectacle
there
was
a
severe
cut
on
his
forehead
as
well
as
his
cheek
his
face
was
pale
and
streaked
with
blood
while
the
bandages
which
were
tied
under
his
chin
by
no
means
improved
his
personal
appearance
his
head
ached
with
the
pain
and
his
eyes
smarted
with
the
strong
sunlight
to
which
he
had
been
exposed
all
the
day
but
his
natural
gaiety
was
undiminished
and
he
laughed
as
he
answered
you
are
too
good
to
me
it
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
that
sigurd
threw
that
stone
yes
since
it
brings
me
your
pity
but
do
not
trouble
a
little
cold
water
and
a
fresh
handkerchief
is
all
i
need
but
thelma
was
already
practicing
her
own
simple
surgery
for
his
benefit
with
deft
soft
fingers
she
laid
bare
the
throbbing
wound
washed
and
dressed
it
carefully
and
skillfully
and
used
with
all
such
exceeding
gentleness
that
duprèz
closed
his
eyes
in
a
sort
of
rapture
during
the
operation
and
wished
it
could
last
longer
then
taking
the
glass
of
wine
her
father
brought
in
obedience
to
her
order
she
said
in
a
tone
of
mild
authority
now
you
will
drink
this
monsieur
pierre
and
you
will
rest
quite
still
till
it
is
time
to
go
back
to
the
yacht
and
you
will
not
feel
any
pain
i
am
sure
and
i
do
think
it
will
not
be
an
ugly
scar
for
long
if
it
is
answered
pierre
i
shall
say
i
received
it
in
a
duel
then
i
shall
be
great
glorious
and
all
the
pretty
ladies
will
love
me
she
laughed
but
looked
grave
a
moment
afterwards
you
must
never
say
what
is
not
true
she
said
it
is
wrong
to
deceive
any
one
even
in
a
small
matter
duprèz
gazed
up
at
her
wonderingly
feeling
very
much
like
a
chidden
child
never
say
what
is
not
true
he
thought
mon
dieu
what
would
become
of
my
life
it
was
a
new
suggestion
and
he
reflected
upon
it
with
astonishment
it
opened
such
a
wide
vista
of
impossibilities
to
his
mind
meanwhile
old
güldmar
was
engaged
in
pouring
out
wine
for
the
other
young
men
talking
all
the
time
i
tell
thee
thelma
mine
he
said
seriously
something
must
be
very
wrong
with
our
sigurd
the
poor
lad
has
always
been
gentle
and
tractable
but
he
was
like
some
wild
animal
for
mischief
and
hardihood
i
grieve
to
see
it
i
fear
the
time
may
come
when
he
may
no
longer
be
a
safe
servant
for
thee
child
oh
father
and
the
girl
voice
was
full
of
tender
anxiety
surely
not
he
is
too
fond
of
us
to
do
us
any
harm
he
is
so
docile
and
affectionate
maybe
maybe
and
the
old
farmer
shook
his
head
doubtfully
but
when
the
wits
are
away
the
brain
is
like
a
ship
without
ballast
there
is
no
safe
sailing
possible
he
would
not
mean
any
harm
perhaps
and
yet
in
his
wild
moods
he
might
do
it
and
be
sorry
for
it
directly
afterwards
is
little
use
to
cry
when
the
mischief
is
done
and
i
confess
i
do
not
like
his
present
humor
observed
lorimer
that
reminds
me
sigurd
has
taken
an
uncommonly
strong
aversion
to
phil
it
curious
but
it
a
fact
perhaps
it
is
that
which
upsets
his
nerves
i
have
noticed
it
myself
said
errington
and
i
sorry
for
it
for
i
done
him
no
harm
that
i
can
remember
he
certainly
asked
me
to
go
away
from
the
altenfjord
and
i
refused
i
no
idea
he
had
any
serious
meaning
in
his
request
but
it
evident
he
ca
endure
my
company
ah
then
said
thelma
simply
and
sorrowfully
he
must
be
very
ill
because
it
is
natural
for
every
one
to
like
you
she
spoke
in
perfect
good
faith
and
innocence
of
heart
but
eyes
flashed
and
he
smiled
one
of
those
rare
tender
smiles
of
his
which
brightened
his
whole
visage
you
are
very
kind
to
say
so
miss
güldmar
it
is
not
kindness
it
is
the
truth
she
replied
frankly
at
that
moment
a
very
rosy
face
and
two
sparkling
eyes
peered
in
at
the
door
yes
britta
thelma
smiled
we
are
quite
ready
whereupon
the
face
disappeared
and
olaf
güldmar
led
the
way
into
the
kitchen
which
was
at
the
same
time
the
and
where
a
substantial
supper
was
spread
on
the
polished
pine
table
the
farmer
great
was
brought
in
for
duprèz
who
though
he
declared
he
was
being
spoilt
by
too
much
attention
seemed
to
enjoy
it
immensely
and
they
were
all
including
britta
soon
clustered
round
the
hospitable
board
whereon
antique
silver
and
quaint
glasses
of
foreign
make
sparkled
bravely
their
effect
enhanced
by
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
homespun
a
few
minutes
set
them
all
talking
gaily
macfarlane
vied
with
the
duprèz
in
making
a
few
compliments
to
britta
who
was
pretty
and
engaging
enough
to
merit
attention
and
who
after
all
was
something
more
than
a
mere
servant
possessing
as
she
did
a
great
deal
of
her
young
mistress
affection
and
confidence
and
being
always
treated
by
güldmar
himself
as
one
of
the
family
there
was
no
reserve
or
coldness
in
the
party
and
the
hum
of
their
merry
voices
echoed
up
to
the
of
the
stout
wooden
ceiling
and
through
the
open
door
and
window
from
whence
a
patch
of
the
gorgeous
afternoon
sky
could
be
seen
glimmering
redly
like
a
distant
lake
of
fire
they
were
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
their
repast
and
the
old
farmer
rollicking
ha
ha
ha
in
response
to
a
joke
of
lorimer
had
just
echoed
jovially
through
the
room
when
a
strong
harsh
voice
called
aloud
olaf
güldmar
there
was
a
sudden
silence
each
one
looked
at
the
other
in
surprise
again
the
voice
called
olaf
güldmar
well
roared
the
testily
turning
sharply
round
in
his
chair
who
calls
me
i
do
and
the
tall
emaciated
figure
of
a
woman
advanced
and
stood
on
the
threshold
without
actually
entering
the
room
she
dropped
the
black
shawl
that
enveloped
her
and
in
so
doing
disordered
her
hair
which
fell
in
white
straggling
locks
about
her
withered
features
and
her
dark
eyes
gleamed
maliciously
as
she
fixed
them
on
the
assembled
party
britta
on
perceiving
her
uttered
a
faint
shriek
and
without
considering
the
propriety
of
her
action
buried
her
curls
and
sparkling
eyes
in
duprèz
which
to
do
the
frenchman
justice
was
exceedingly
prompt
to
receive
and
shelter
its
fair
burden
the
rose
from
his
chair
and
his
face
grew
stern
what
do
you
here
lovisa
elsland
have
you
walked
thus
far
from
talvig
to
pay
a
visit
that
must
needs
be
unwelcome
unwelcome
i
know
i
am
replied
lovisa
disdainfully
noting
the
terror
of
britta
and
the
astonished
glances
if
errington
and
his
friends
unwelcome
at
all
times
but
most
unwelcome
at
the
hour
of
feasting
and
folly
for
who
can
endure
to
receive
a
message
from
the
lord
when
the
mouth
is
full
of
savory
morsels
and
the
brain
reels
with
the
wicked
wine
yet
i
have
come
in
spite
of
your
iniquities
olaf
güldmar
strong
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
i
dare
to
set
foot
upon
your
accursèd
threshold
and
once
more
make
my
just
demand
give
me
back
the
child
of
my
dead
daughter
restore
to
me
the
erring
creature
who
should
be
the
prop
of
my
defenceless
age
had
not
your
pagan
spells
alienated
her
from
me
release
her
and
bid
her
return
with
me
to
my
desolate
hearth
and
home
this
done
i
will
stay
the
tempest
that
threatens
your
habitation
i
will
hold
back
the
dark
cloud
of
destruction
i
will
avert
the
wrath
of
the
lord
yes
for
the
sake
of
the
past
for
the
sake
of
the
past
these
last
words
she
muttered
in
a
low
tone
more
to
herself
than
to
güldmar
and
having
spoken
she
averted
her
eyes
from
the
company
drew
her
shawl
closely
about
her
and
waited
for
an
answer
by
all
the
gods
of
my
fathers
shouted
the
in
a
towering
passion
this
passes
my
utmost
endurance
have
i
not
told
thee
again
and
again
thou
silly
soul
that
thy
grandchild
is
no
slave
she
is
free
free
to
return
to
thee
an
she
will
free
also
to
stay
with
us
where
she
has
found
a
happier
home
than
thy
miserable
hut
at
talvig
britta
and
he
thumped
his
fist
on
the
table
look
up
child
speak
for
thyself
thou
hast
a
spirit
of
thine
own
here
is
thy
one
earthly
relation
wilt
go
with
her
neither
thy
mistress
nor
i
will
stand
in
the
way
of
thy
pleasure
thus
adjured
britta
looked
up
so
suddenly
that
duprèz
who
had
rather
enjoyed
the
feel
of
her
little
nestling
head
hidden
upon
his
arm
was
quite
startled
and
he
was
still
more
so
at
the
utter
defiance
that
flashed
into
the
small
maiden
round
rosy
face
go
with
she
cried
shrilly
addressing
the
old
woman
who
remained
standing
in
the
same
attitude
with
an
air
of
perfect
composure
do
you
think
i
have
forgotten
how
you
treated
my
mother
or
how
you
used
to
beat
me
and
starve
me
you
wicked
old
woman
how
dare
you
come
here
i
ashamed
of
you
you
frightened
my
mother
to
death
you
know
you
did
and
now
you
want
to
do
the
same
to
me
but
you
wo
i
can
tell
you
i
old
enough
to
do
as
i
like
and
rather
die
than
live
with
you
then
overcome
by
excitement
and
temper
she
burst
out
crying
heedless
of
pierre
duprèz
smiling
nods
of
approval
and
the
admiring
remarks
he
was
making
under
his
breath
such
as
ma
petite
bien
fait
joliment
bien
dit
mais
je
crois
bien
lovisa
seemed
unmoved
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
güldmar
is
this
your
answer
she
demanded
by
the
sword
of
odin
cried
the
the
woman
must
be
mad
answer
the
girl
has
spoken
for
herself
and
plainly
enough
too
art
thou
deaf
lovisa
elsland
or
are
thy
wits
astray
my
hearing
is
very
good
replied
lovisa
calmly
and
my
mind
olaf
güldmar
is
as
clear
as
yours
and
thanks
to
your
teaching
in
mine
early
days
she
paused
and
looked
keenly
at
him
but
he
appeared
to
see
no
meaning
in
her
allusion
i
know
the
english
tongue
of
which
we
hear
far
too
much
too
often
there
is
nothing
britta
has
said
that
i
do
not
understand
but
i
know
well
it
is
not
the
girl
herself
that
speaks
it
is
a
demon
in
her
and
that
demon
shall
be
cast
forth
before
i
die
yea
with
the
help
of
the
lord
i
shall
she
stopped
abruptly
and
fixed
her
eyes
glowing
with
fierce
wrath
on
thelma
the
girl
met
her
evil
glance
with
a
gentle
surprise
lovisa
smiled
malignantly
you
know
me
i
think
said
lovisa
you
have
seen
me
before
often
answered
thelma
mildly
i
have
always
been
sorry
for
you
sorry
for
me
almost
yelled
the
old
woman
why
why
are
you
sorry
for
me
do
not
answer
her
child
interrupted
güldmar
angrily
she
is
mad
as
the
winds
of
a
wild
winter
and
will
but
vex
thee
but
thelma
laid
her
hand
soothingly
on
her
father
and
smiled
peacefully
as
she
turned
her
fair
face
again
towards
lovisa
why
she
said
because
you
seem
so
very
lonely
and
sad
and
that
must
make
you
cross
with
every
one
who
is
happy
and
it
is
a
pity
i
think
that
you
do
not
let
britta
alone
you
only
quarrel
with
each
other
when
you
meet
and
would
you
not
like
her
to
think
kindly
of
you
when
you
are
dead
lovisa
seemed
choking
with
anger
her
face
worked
into
such
hideous
grimaces
that
all
present
save
thelma
were
dismayed
at
her
repulsive
aspect
when
i
am
dead
she
muttered
hoarsely
so
you
count
upon
that
already
do
you
ah
but
do
you
know
which
of
us
shall
die
first
then
raising
her
voice
with
an
effort
she
exclaimed
stand
forth
thelma
güldmar
let
me
see
you
closely
face
to
face
errington
said
something
in
a
low
tone
and
the
would
have
again
interfered
but
thelma
shook
her
head
smiled
and
rose
from
her
seat
at
table
anything
to
soothe
her
poor
soul
she
whispered
as
she
left
errington
side
and
advanced
towards
lovisa
till
she
was
within
reach
of
the
old
woman
hand
she
looked
like
some
grand
white
angel
who
had
stepped
down
from
a
cathedral
altar
as
she
stood
erect
and
stately
with
a
gravely
pitying
expression
in
her
lovely
eyes
confronting
the
withered
leering
hag
who
fixed
upon
her
a
steady
look
of
the
most
cruel
and
pitiless
hatred
daughter
of
satan
said
lovisa
then
in
intense
piercing
tones
that
somehow
carried
with
them
a
sense
of
awe
and
horror
creature
in
whose
veins
the
fire
of
hell
burns
without
ceasing
my
upon
you
my
curse
upon
the
beauty
of
your
body
may
it
grow
loathsome
in
the
sight
of
all
men
may
those
who
embrace
you
embrace
misfortune
and
ruin
may
love
betray
you
and
forsake
you
may
your
heart
be
broken
even
as
mine
has
been
may
your
bridal
bed
be
left
deserted
may
your
children
wither
and
pine
from
their
hour
of
birth
sorrow
track
you
to
the
grave
may
your
death
be
lingering
and
horrible
god
be
my
witness
and
fulfill
my
words
and
raising
her
arms
with
wild
gesture
she
turned
and
left
the
house
the
spell
of
stupefied
silence
was
broken
with
her
disappearance
old
güldmar
prepared
to
rush
after
her
and
force
her
to
retract
her
evil
speech
errington
was
furious
and
britta
cried
bitterly
the
lazy
lorimer
was
excited
and
annoyed
fetch
her
back
he
said
and
i
dance
upon
her
but
thelma
stood
where
the
old
woman
had
left
her
she
smiled
faintly
but
she
was
very
pale
errington
approached
her
she
turned
to
him
and
stretched
out
her
hands
with
a
little
appealing
gesture
my
friend
she
said
softly
do
you
think
i
deserve
so
many
curses
is
there
something
about
me
that
is
evil
what
errington
would
have
answered
is
doubtful
his
heart
beat
wildly
he
longed
to
draw
those
little
hands
in
his
own
and
cover
them
with
passionate
kisses
but
he
was
intercepted
by
old
güldmar
who
caught
his
daughter
in
his
arms
and
hugged
her
closely
his
silvery
beard
mingling
with
the
gold
of
her
rippling
hair
never
fear
a
wicked
tongue
my
bird
said
the
old
man
fondly
there
is
naught
of
harm
that
would
touch
thee
either
on
earth
or
in
heaven
and
a
curse
must
roll
off
thy
soul
like
water
from
a
dove
wing
cheer
thee
my
darling
cheer
thee
what
thine
own
creed
teaches
thee
that
the
gentle
mother
of
christ
with
her
little
white
angels
round
her
watches
over
all
innocent
maids
and
thinkest
thou
she
will
let
an
old
woman
malice
and
envy
blight
thy
young
days
no
no
accursed
and
the
laughed
loudly
to
hide
the
tears
that
moistened
his
keen
eyes
thou
art
the
sweetest
blessing
of
my
heart
even
as
thy
mother
was
before
thee
come
come
raise
thy
pretty
head
here
are
these
merry
lads
growing
and
britta
is
weeping
enough
salt
water
to
fill
a
bucket
one
of
thy
smiles
will
set
us
all
right
again
ay
there
now
as
she
looked
up
and
meeting
philip
eloquent
eyes
blushed
and
withdrew
herself
gently
from
her
father
arms
let
us
finish
our
supper
and
think
no
more
of
yonder
villainous
old
hag
she
is
crazy
i
believe
and
knows
not
what
she
says
half
her
time
now
britta
cease
thy
grunting
and
sighing
spoil
thy
face
and
will
not
mend
the
hole
in
thy
grandmother
brain
wicked
spiteful
ugly
old
thing
sobbed
britta
i
never
never
never
forgive
her
then
running
to
thelma
she
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
it
affectionately
oh
my
dear
my
dear
to
think
she
should
have
cursed
you
what
dreadful
dreadful
wickedness
oh
and
britta
looked
volumes
of
wrath
i
could
have
beaten
her
black
and
blue
her
vicious
eagerness
was
almost
comic
every
one
laughed
including
thelma
though
she
pressed
the
hand
of
her
little
servant
very
warmly
oh
fie
said
lorimer
seriously
little
girls
must
whip
their
grandmothers
it
specially
forbidden
in
the
is
it
phil
i
sure
i
do
know
replied
errington
merrily
i
believe
there
is
something
to
the
effect
that
a
man
may
not
marry
his
grandmother
perhaps
that
is
what
you
mean
ah
no
doubt
murmured
lorimer
languidly
as
with
the
others
he
resumed
his
seat
at
the
i
knew
there
was
a
special
mandate
respecting
one
particularly
venerable
relations
with
a
view
to
in
case
they
should
prove
troublesome
like
good
what
a
frightfully
picturesque
mouthing
old
lady
she
is
she
is
of
norway
exclaimed
duprèz
she
would
make
an
admirable
dancer
in
the
carmagnole
macfarlane
who
had
preserved
a
discreet
silence
throughout
the
whole
scene
here
looked
up
she
just
a
o
mistaken
piety
he
said
she
minds
me
a
glowerin
auld
warlock
of
an
aunt
o
mine
in
glasgie
wha
sits
in
her
chair
a
day
wi
ae
finger
on
the
bible
she
says
she
gaun
straight
to
heaven
by
special
invitation
o
the
lord
leavin
a
her
blood
relations
howlin
vainly
after
her
from
their
roastin
fires
down
below
ma
certes
she
give
ye
a
good
rousin
curse
if
ye
like
she
cursed
me
ever
since
i
can
remember
her
cursed
me
in
and
out
from
sunrise
to
sunset
but
i
no
the
worse
as
yet
an
it
dootful
whether
she
any
the
better
and
yet
lovisa
elsland
used
to
be
as
merry
and
lissom
a
lass
as
ever
stepped
said
güldmar
musingly
i
remember
her
well
when
both
she
and
i
were
young
i
was
always
on
the
sea
at
that
time
never
happy
unless
the
waves
tossed
me
and
my
vessel
from
one
shore
to
another
i
suppose
the
restless
spirit
of
my
fathers
was
in
me
i
was
never
contented
unless
i
saw
some
new
coast
every
six
months
or
so
well
lovisa
was
always
foremost
among
the
girls
of
the
village
who
watched
me
leave
the
fjord
and
however
long
or
short
a
time
i
might
be
absent
she
was
certain
to
be
on
the
shore
when
my
ship
came
sailing
home
again
many
a
joke
i
have
cracked
with
her
and
her
companions
and
she
was
a
bonnie
enough
creature
to
look
at
then
i
tell
you
though
now
she
is
like
a
battered
on
a
wreck
her
marriage
spoiled
her
temper
her
husband
was
as
dark
and
sour
a
man
as
could
be
met
with
in
all
norway
and
when
he
and
his
sank
in
a
squall
off
the
lofoden
islands
i
doubt
if
she
shed
many
tears
for
his
loss
her
only
daughter
husband
went
down
in
the
same
storm
and
he
but
three
months
wedded
and
the
girl
britta
mother
pined
and
pined
and
even
when
her
child
was
born
took
no
sort
of
comfort
in
it
she
died
four
years
after
britta
birth
her
death
was
hastened
so
i
have
heard
through
old
lovisa
harsh
treatment
anyhow
the
little
lass
she
left
behind
her
had
no
very
easy
time
of
it
all
alone
with
her
grandmother
eh
britta
britta
looked
up
and
shook
her
head
emphatically
then
went
on
güldmar
when
my
girl
came
back
the
last
time
from
france
britta
chanced
to
see
her
and
strangely
enough
here
he
winked
shrewdly
took
a
fancy
to
her
face
odd
was
it
however
nothing
would
suit
her
but
that
she
must
be
thelma
handmaiden
and
here
she
is
now
you
know
her
history
she
would
be
happy
enough
if
her
grandmother
would
let
her
alone
but
the
silly
old
woman
thinks
the
girl
is
under
a
spell
and
that
thelma
is
the
witch
that
works
it
and
the
old
farmer
laughed
there
a
grain
of
truth
in
the
notion
too
but
not
in
the
way
she
has
of
looking
at
it
all
women
are
witches
said
duprèz
britta
is
a
little
witch
herself
britta
rosy
cheeks
grew
rosier
at
this
and
she
tossed
her
chestnut
curls
with
an
air
of
saucy
defiance
that
delighted
the
frenchman
he
forgot
his
wounded
cheek
and
his
disfiguring
bandages
in
the
contemplation
of
the
little
plump
figure
cased
in
its
scarlet
bodice
and
the
tempting
rosy
lips
that
were
in
such
close
proximity
to
his
touch
if
it
were
not
for
those
red
hands
he
thought
dieu
what
a
charming
child
she
would
be
one
would
instantly
kill
the
grandmother
and
kiss
the
granddaughter
and
he
watched
her
with
admiration
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
attending
to
every
one
with
diligence
and
care
but
reserving
her
special
services
for
thelma
whom
she
waited
on
with
a
mingled
tenderness
and
reverence
that
were
both
touching
and
pretty
to
see
the
conversation
now
became
general
and
nothing
further
occurred
to
disturb
the
harmony
and
hilarity
of
the
party
only
errington
seemed
somewhat
abstracted
and
answered
many
questions
that
were
put
to
him
at
haphazard
without
knowing
or
possibly
caring
whether
his
replies
were
intelligible
or
incoherent
his
thoughts
were
dreamlike
and
brilliant
with
fairy
sunshine
he
understood
at
last
what
poets
meant
by
their
melodious
musings
woven
into
golden
threads
of
song
he
seemed
to
have
grasped
some
hitherto
unguessed
secret
of
his
being
a
secret
that
filled
him
with
as
much
strange
pain
as
pleasure
he
felt
as
though
he
were
endowed
with
a
thousand
senses
each
one
keenly
alive
and
sensitive
to
the
smallest
touch
and
there
was
a
pulsation
in
his
blood
that
was
new
and
beyond
his
control
a
something
that
beat
wildly
in
his
heart
at
the
sound
of
thelma
voice
or
the
passing
flutter
of
her
white
garments
near
him
of
what
use
to
disguise
it
from
himself
any
longer
he
loved
her
the
terrible
beautiful
tempest
of
love
had
broken
over
his
life
at
last
there
was
no
escape
from
its
thunderous
passion
and
dazzling
lightning
glory
he
drew
a
sharp
quick
breath
the
hum
of
the
gay
voices
around
him
was
more
meaningless
to
his
ears
than
the
sound
of
the
sea
breaking
on
the
beach
below
he
glanced
at
the
girl
the
fair
and
innocent
creature
who
had
in
his
imagination
risen
to
a
throne
of
imperial
height
from
whence
she
could
bestow
on
him
death
or
salvation
how
calm
she
seemed
she
was
listening
with
courteous
patience
to
a
long
story
of
macfarlane
whose
scotch
accent
rendered
it
difficult
for
her
to
understand
she
was
pale
philip
thought
and
her
eyes
were
heavy
but
she
smiled
now
and
then
such
a
smile
even
so
sweetly
might
the
lips
of
the
greek
aphrodite
part
could
that
eloquent
and
matchless
marble
for
once
breathe
into
life
he
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
fear
her
hands
held
his
fate
what
if
she
could
not
love
him
what
if
he
must
lose
her
utterly
this
idea
overpowered
him
his
brain
whirled
and
he
suddenly
pushed
away
his
untasted
glass
of
wine
and
rose
abruptly
from
the
table
heedless
of
the
surprise
his
action
excited
hullo
phil
where
are
you
off
to
cried
lorimer
wait
for
me
tired
of
our
company
my
lad
said
güldmar
kindly
you
had
a
long
day
of
it
and
what
with
the
climbing
and
the
strong
air
no
doubt
you
be
glad
to
turn
in
upon
my
life
sir
answered
errington
with
some
confusion
i
know
why
i
got
up
just
now
i
was
thinking
i
rather
a
dreamy
sort
of
fellow
sometimes
and
he
was
asleep
and
does
want
to
own
it
interrupted
lorimer
sententiously
you
will
excuse
him
he
means
well
he
looks
rather
seedy
i
think
güldmar
we
be
off
to
the
yacht
by
the
way
you
coming
with
us
are
you
oh
yes
said
thelma
we
will
sail
with
you
round
by
soroe
it
is
weird
and
dark
and
grand
but
i
think
it
is
beautiful
and
there
are
many
stories
of
the
elves
and
who
are
said
to
dwell
there
among
the
deep
ravines
have
you
heard
about
the
she
continued
addressing
herself
to
errington
unaware
of
the
effort
he
was
making
to
appear
cool
and
composed
in
her
presence
no
then
i
must
tell
you
they
all
walked
out
of
the
house
into
the
porch
and
while
her
father
was
interchanging
farewells
with
the
others
she
looked
at
sir
grave
face
with
some
solicitude
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
tired
my
friend
she
asked
softly
or
your
head
aches
and
you
suffer
he
caught
her
hands
swiftly
and
raised
them
to
his
lips
would
you
care
much
would
you
care
at
all
if
i
suffered
he
murmured
in
a
low
tone
then
before
she
could
speak
or
move
he
let
go
her
hands
again
and
turned
with
his
usual
easy
courtesy
to
güldmar
then
we
may
expect
you
without
fail
sir
good
night
good
night
my
lad
and
with
many
hearty
salutations
the
young
men
took
their
departure
raising
their
hats
to
thelma
as
they
turned
down
the
winding
path
to
the
shore
she
remained
standing
near
her
father
and
when
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
had
died
away
she
drew
closer
still
and
laid
her
head
against
his
breast
cold
my
bird
queried
the
old
man
why
thou
art
shivering
child
and
yet
the
sunshine
is
as
warm
as
wine
what
ails
thee
nothing
father
and
she
raised
her
eyes
glowing
and
brilliant
as
stars
tell
me
do
you
think
often
of
my
mother
now
often
and
güldmar
fine
resolute
face
grew
sad
and
tender
she
is
never
absent
from
my
mind
i
see
her
night
and
day
ay
i
can
feel
her
soft
arms
clinging
round
my
neck
why
dost
thou
ask
so
strange
a
question
little
one
is
it
possible
to
forget
what
has
been
once
loved
thelma
was
silent
for
many
minutes
then
she
kissed
her
father
and
said
good
night
he
held
her
by
the
hand
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
vague
anxiety
art
thou
well
my
child
he
asked
this
little
hand
burns
like
fire
and
thine
eyes
are
too
bright
surely
for
sleep
to
visit
them
art
sure
that
nothing
ails
thee
sure
quite
sure
answered
the
girl
with
a
strange
dreamy
smile
i
am
quite
well
and
happy
and
she
turned
to
enter
the
house
stay
called
the
father
promise
me
thou
wilt
think
no
more
of
lovisa
i
had
nearly
forgotten
her
she
responded
poor
thing
she
cursed
me
because
she
is
so
miserable
i
suppose
all
alone
and
unloved
it
must
be
hard
curses
sometimes
turn
to
blessings
father
good
night
and
she
ascended
the
one
flight
of
wooden
stairs
in
the
house
to
her
own
bedroom
a
little
place
as
clean
and
white
as
the
interior
of
a
shell
never
once
glancing
at
the
small
mirror
that
seemed
to
invite
her
charms
to
reflect
themselves
therein
she
went
to
the
quaint
latticed
window
and
knelt
down
by
it
folding
her
arms
on
the
sill
while
she
looked
far
out
to
the
fjord
she
could
see
the
english
flag
fluttering
from
the
masts
of
the
she
could
almost
hear
the
steady
plash
of
the
oars
wielded
by
errington
and
his
friends
as
they
rowed
themselves
back
to
the
yacht
bright
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
brimmed
over
falling
warmly
on
her
folded
hands
would
i
care
if
you
suffered
she
whispered
oh
my
love
my
love
then
as
if
afraid
lest
the
very
winds
should
have
heard
her
exclamation
she
shut
her
window
in
haste
and
a
hot
blush
crimsoned
her
cheeks
undressing
quickly
she
slipped
into
her
little
white
bed
and
closing
her
eyes
fancied
she
slept
though
her
sleep
was
but
a
waking
dream
of
love
in
which
all
bright
hopes
reached
their
utmost
fulfillment
and
yet
were
in
some
strange
way
crossed
with
shadows
which
she
had
no
power
to
disperse
and
later
on
when
old
güldmar
slumbered
soundly
and
the
golden
sunshine
lit
up
every
nook
and
gable
of
the
farmhouse
with
its
lustrous
glory
making
thelma
closed
lattice
sparkle
like
a
carven
jewel
a
desolate
figure
lay
prone
on
the
grass
beneath
her
window
with
meagre
pale
face
and
wild
blue
eyes
upturned
to
the
fiery
brilliancy
of
the
heavens

eric
mackay
of
a
on
the
following
morning
the
heat
was
intense
no
breath
of
wind
stirred
a
ripple
on
the
fjord
and
there
was
a
heaviness
in
the
atmosphere
which
made
the
very
brightness
of
the
sky
oppressive
such
hot
weather
was
unusual
for
that
part
of
norway
and
according
to
valdemar
svensen
betokened
some
change
on
board
the
everything
was
ready
for
the
trip
to
soroe
steam
was
getting
up
prior
to
departure
and
a
group
of
sailors
stood
prepared
to
weigh
the
anchor
as
soon
as
the
signal
was
given
breakfast
was
over
macfarlane
was
in
the
saloon
writing
his
journal
which
he
kept
with
great
exactitude
and
duprèz
who
on
account
of
his
wound
was
considered
something
of
an
invalid
was
seated
in
a
lounge
chair
on
deck
delightedly
turning
over
a
bundle
of
inflammatory
french
political
journals
received
that
morning
errington
and
lorimer
were
pacing
the
deck
arm
in
arm
keeping
a
sharp
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
returning
boat
which
had
been
sent
off
to
fetch
thelma
and
her
father
errington
looked
vexed
and
excited
lorimer
bland
and
convincing
i
ca
help
it
phil
he
said
it
no
use
fretting
and
fuming
at
me
it
was
like
dyceworthy
impudence
of
course
but
there
no
doubt
he
proposed
to
her
and
it
equally
certain
that
she
rejected
him
i
thought
i
tell
you
you
had
a
rival
not
in
me
as
you
seemed
to
think
yesterday
but
in
our
holy
fat
friend
rival
pshaw
returned
errington
with
an
angry
laugh
he
is
not
worth
kicking
possibly
not
still
i
have
a
presentiment
that
he
the
sort
of
fellow
that
wo
take
for
an
answer
he
dodge
that
poor
girl
and
make
her
life
miserable
if
he
can
unless
unless
what
asked
philip
quickly
lorimer
stopped
in
his
walk
and
leaning
against
the
looked
his
friend
straight
in
the
eyes
unless
you
settle
the
matter
he
said
with
a
slight
effort
you
love
her
tell
her
so
errington
laid
one
hand
earnestly
on
his
shoulder
ah
george
you
do
understand
he
said
in
a
low
tone
while
his
face
was
grave
and
full
of
trouble
i
used
to
think
i
was
fairly
brave
but
i
find
i
am
a
positive
coward
i
dare
not
tell
her
she
thelma
is
not
like
other
women
you
may
think
me
a
fool
i
dare
say
you
do
but
i
swear
to
you
i
am
afraid
to
speak
because
because
old
boy
if
she
were
to
refuse
me
if
i
knew
there
was
no
hope
well
i
do
want
to
be
sentimental
but
my
life
would
be
utterly
empty
and
worthless
so
useless
that
i
doubt
if
i
should
care
to
live
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
lorimer
heard
him
in
silence
a
silence
maintained
partly
out
of
sympathy
and
partly
that
he
might
keep
his
own
feelings
well
under
control
but
why
persist
in
looking
at
the
gloomy
side
of
the
picture
he
said
at
last
suppose
she
loves
you
suppose
an
angel
flew
down
from
heaven
replied
philip
with
rather
a
sad
smile
my
dear
fellow
who
am
i
that
i
should
flatter
myself
so
far
if
she
were
one
of
those
ordinary
women
to
whom
marriage
is
the
and
of
existence
it
would
be
different
but
she
is
not
her
thoughts
are
like
those
of
a
child
or
a
poet
why
should
i
trouble
them
by
the
selfishness
of
my
passion
for
all
passion
selfish
even
at
its
best
why
should
i
venture
to
break
the
calm
friendship
she
may
have
for
me
by
telling
her
of
a
love
which
might
prove
unwelcome
lorimer
looked
at
him
with
gentle
amusement
depicted
in
his
face
phil
you
are
less
conceited
than
i
thought
you
were
he
said
with
a
light
laugh
or
else
you
are
blind
blind
as
a
bat
old
man
take
my
advice
do
lose
any
more
time
about
it
make
the
daughter
of
norroway
happy
and
a
brief
sigh
escaped
him
you
are
the
man
to
do
it
i
am
surprised
at
your
density
sigurd
the
lunatic
has
more
perception
he
sees
which
way
the
wind
blows
and
that
why
he
so
desperately
unhappy
he
thinks
and
thinks
rightly
too
that
he
will
lose
his
rose
of
the
northern
forest
as
he
calls
her
and
that
you
are
to
be
the
robber
hence
his
dislike
to
you
dear
me
and
lorimer
lit
a
cigarette
and
puffed
at
it
complacently
it
seems
to
me
that
my
wits
are
becoming
sharper
as
i
grow
older
and
that
yours
my
dear
boy
pardon
me
are
getting
somewhat
blunted
otherwise
you
would
certainly
have
perceived
he
broke
off
abruptly
well
go
on
exclaimed
philip
eagerly
with
flashing
eyes
perceived
what
lorimer
laughed
that
the
boat
containing
your
is
coming
along
very
rapidly
old
fellow
and
that
you
better
make
haste
to
receive
her
this
was
the
fact
and
duprèz
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
waving
his
french
newspaper
energetically
to
the
approaching
visitors
errington
hastened
to
the
gangway
with
a
brighter
flush
than
usual
on
his
handsome
face
and
his
heart
beating
with
a
new
sense
of
exhilaration
and
excitement
if
lorimer
hints
had
any
foundation
of
truth
if
thelma
loved
him
ever
so
little
how
wild
a
dream
it
seemed
why
not
risk
his
fate
he
resolved
to
speak
to
her
that
very
day
if
opportunity
favored
him
and
having
thus
decided
felt
quite
masterful
and
heroic
about
it
this
feeling
of
proud
and
tender
elation
increased
when
thelma
stepped
on
deck
that
morning
and
laid
her
hands
in
his
for
as
he
greeted
her
and
her
father
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
was
slightly
changed
some
restless
dream
must
have
haunted
her
or
his
hurried
words
beneath
the
porch
when
he
parted
from
her
the
previous
evening
had
startled
her
and
troubled
her
mind
her
blue
eyes
were
no
longer
raised
to
his
in
absolute
candor
her
voice
was
timid
and
she
had
lost
something
of
her
usual
buoyant
and
graceful
but
she
looked
lovelier
than
ever
with
that
air
of
shy
hesitation
and
appealing
sweetness
love
had
thrown
his
network
of
light
about
her
soul
and
body
till
like
madeleine
she
seemed
a
splendid
angel
newly
drest
save
wings
for
heaven
as
soon
as
the
güldmars
were
on
board
the
anchor
was
weighed
with
many
a
cheery
and
musical
cry
from
the
sailors
the
wheel
revolved
rapidly
under
valdemar
svensen
firm
hand
and
with
a
grand
outward
sweeping
curtsy
to
the
majestic
fjord
she
left
behind
her
the
steamed
away
cutting
a
glittering
line
of
white
foam
through
the
smooth
water
as
she
went
and
threading
her
way
swiftly
among
the
clustering
picturesque
islands
while
the
inhabitants
of
every
little
farm
and
hamlet
on
the
shores
stopped
for
a
while
in
their
occupations
to
stare
at
the
superb
vessel
and
to
dreamily
envy
the
wealth
of
the
english
who
could
afford
to
pass
the
summer
months
in
such
luxury
and
idleness
thelma
seated
herself
at
once
by
duprèz
and
seemed
glad
to
divert
attention
from
herself
to
him
you
are
better
monsieur
duprèz
are
you
not
she
asked
gently
we
saw
sigurd
this
morning
he
came
home
last
night
he
is
very
very
sorry
to
have
hurt
you
he
need
not
apologize
said
duprèz
cheerfully
i
am
delighted
he
gave
me
this
scar
otherwise
i
am
confident
he
would
have
put
out
the
eye
of
and
that
would
have
been
a
misfortune
for
what
would
the
ladies
in
london
say
if
errington
returned
to
them
with
one
eye
dieu
they
would
all
be
en
desespoir
thelma
looked
up
philip
was
standing
at
some
little
distance
with
olaf
güldmar
and
lorimer
talking
and
laughing
gaily
his
cap
was
slightly
pushed
off
his
forehead
and
the
sun
shone
on
his
thick
curls
his
features
warmly
colored
by
the
wind
and
sea
were
lit
up
with
mirth
and
his
even
white
teeth
sparkled
in
an
irresistible
smile
of
fascinating
he
was
the
of
the
best
type
of
englishman
in
the
full
tide
of
youth
health
and
good
spirits
i
suppose
he
is
a
great
favorite
with
all
those
beautiful
ladies
she
asked
very
quietly
something
of
gentle
resignation
in
her
tone
struck
the
frenchman
sense
of
chivalry
had
she
been
like
any
ordinary
woman
bent
on
conquest
he
would
have
taken
a
mischievous
delight
in
inventing
a
long
list
of
fair
ones
supposed
to
be
deeply
enamored
of
errington
good
looks
but
this
girl
innocent
inquiring
face
inspired
him
with
quite
a
different
sentiment
certainement
he
said
frankly
and
emphatically
is
a
favorite
everywhere
yet
not
more
so
with
women
than
with
men
i
love
him
extremely
he
is
a
charming
boy
then
you
see
he
is
rich
very
rich
and
there
are
so
many
pretty
girls
who
are
very
poor
naturally
they
are
enchanted
with
our
errington
i
do
not
understand
she
said
with
a
puzzled
brow
it
is
not
possible
that
they
should
like
him
better
because
he
is
rich
he
would
be
the
same
man
without
money
as
with
it
it
makes
no
difference
perhaps
not
to
you
returned
duprèz
with
a
smile
but
to
many
it
would
make
an
immense
difference
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
have
plenty
of
money
believe
me
thelma
shrugged
her
shoulders
perhaps
she
answered
indifferently
but
one
can
not
spend
much
on
one
self
after
all
the
nuns
at
arles
used
to
tell
me
that
poverty
was
a
virtue
and
that
to
be
very
rich
was
to
be
very
miserable
they
were
poor
all
those
good
women
and
they
were
always
cheerful
the
nuns
mon
dieu
cried
duprèz
the
darlings
know
not
the
taste
of
joy
they
speak
of
what
they
can
not
understand
how
should
they
know
what
it
is
to
be
happy
or
unhappy
when
they
bar
their
great
convent
doors
against
the
very
name
of
love
she
looked
at
him
and
her
color
rose
you
always
talk
of
she
said
half
reproachfully
as
if
it
were
so
common
a
thing
you
know
it
is
sacred
why
will
you
speak
as
if
it
were
all
a
jest
a
strange
emotion
of
admiring
tenderness
stirred
pierre
heart
he
was
very
impulsive
and
impressionable
forgive
me
he
murmured
penitently
then
he
added
suddenly
you
should
have
lived
ages
ago
the
world
of
will
not
suit
you
you
will
be
made
very
sorrowful
in
it
i
assure
you
it
is
not
a
place
for
good
women
she
laughed
you
are
morose
she
said
that
is
not
like
you
no
one
is
good
we
all
live
to
try
and
make
ourselves
better
what
highly
moral
converse
is
going
on
here
inquired
lorimer
strolling
leisurely
up
to
them
are
you
giving
duprèz
a
lecture
miss
güldmar
he
needs
it
so
do
i
please
give
me
a
scolding
and
he
folded
his
hands
with
an
air
of
demure
appeal
a
sunny
smile
danced
in
the
girl
blue
eyes
always
you
will
be
foolish
she
said
one
can
never
know
you
because
i
am
sure
you
never
show
your
real
self
to
anybody
no
i
will
not
scold
you
but
i
should
like
to
find
you
out
to
find
me
out
echoed
lorimer
why
what
do
you
mean
she
nodded
her
bright
head
with
much
sagacity
ah
i
do
observe
you
often
there
is
something
you
hide
it
is
like
when
my
father
has
tears
in
his
eyes
he
pretends
to
laugh
but
the
tears
are
there
all
the
time
now
i
see
in
you
she
paused
and
her
questioning
eyes
rested
on
his
seriously
this
is
interesting
said
lorimer
lazily
drawing
a
opposite
to
her
and
seating
himself
thereon
i
had
no
idea
i
was
a
human
riddle
can
you
read
me
miss
güldmar
yes
she
answered
slowly
and
meditatively
just
a
little
but
i
will
not
say
anything
no
except
this
that
you
are
not
altogether
what
you
seem
here
phil
called
lorimer
as
he
saw
errington
approaching
arm
in
arm
with
olaf
güldmar
come
and
admire
this
young
lady
power
of
perception
she
declares
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
i
look
now
said
thelma
shaking
her
forefinger
at
him
you
know
very
well
that
i
did
not
put
it
in
that
way
but
is
it
not
true
sir
philip
and
she
looked
up
for
a
moment
though
her
eyes
drooped
again
swiftly
under
his
ardent
gaze
is
it
not
true
that
many
people
do
hide
their
feelings
and
pretend
to
be
quite
different
to
what
they
are
i
should
say
it
was
a
very
common
fault
replied
errington
it
is
a
means
of
against
the
impertinent
curiosity
of
outsiders
but
lorimer
is
free
from
it
he
has
nothing
to
hide
at
any
rate
he
has
no
secrets
from
me
i
sure
of
that
and
he
clapped
his
hand
heartily
on
his
friend
shoulder
lorimer
flushed
slightly
but
made
no
remark
and
at
that
moment
macfarlane
emerged
from
the
saloon
where
the
writing
of
his
journal
had
till
now
detained
him
in
the
general
handshaking
and
salutations
which
followed
the
conversation
took
a
different
turn
for
which
lorimer
was
devoutly
thankful
his
face
was
a
one
and
he
was
rather
afraid
of
philip
keen
eyes
i
hope
to
heaven
he
speak
to
her
he
thought
vexedly
i
hate
being
in
suspense
my
mind
will
be
easier
when
i
once
know
that
he
has
gained
his
point
and
that
not
the
ghost
of
a
chance
for
any
other
fellow
meanwhile
the
yacht
skimmed
along
by
the
barren
and
rocky
coast
of
seiland
the
sun
was
dazzling
yet
there
was
a
mist
in
the
air
as
though
the
heavens
were
full
of
unshed
tears
a
bank
of
nearly
motionless
clouds
hung
behind
the
dark
sharp
peaks
of
the
altenguard
mountains
which
now
lay
to
the
southward
as
the
vessel
pursued
her
course
there
was
no
wind
the
flag
on
the
mast
flapped
idly
now
and
then
with
the
motion
of
the
yacht
and
thelma
found
herself
too
warm
with
her
pretty
crimson
hood
she
therefore
unfastened
it
and
let
the
sunshine
play
on
the
uncovered
gold
of
her
hair
they
had
a
superb
view
of
the
jagged
glacier
of
jedkè
black
in
some
parts
and
in
others
white
with
unmelted
snow
and
seeming
as
it
rose
straight
up
against
the
sky
to
be
the
majestic
monument
of
some
giant
viking
presently
at
her
earnest
request
errington
brought
his
portfolio
of
norwegian
sketches
for
thelma
to
look
at
most
of
them
were
excellently
well
done
and
elicited
much
admiration
from
the
it
is
what
i
have
wondered
at
all
my
life
said
he
that
skill
of
the
brush
dipped
in
color
pictures
surprise
me
as
much
as
poems
ah
men
are
marvellous
creatures
when
they
are
once
brought
to
understand
that
they
men
not
beasts
one
will
take
a
few
words
and
harmonize
them
into
a
song
or
a
verse
that
clings
to
the
world
for
ever
another
will
mix
a
few
paints
and
dab
a
brush
in
them
and
give
you
a
picture
that
generation
after
generation
shall
flock
to
see
it
is
what
is
called
genius
and
genius
is
a
sort
of
miracle
yet
i
think
it
is
fostered
by
climate
a
good
deal
the
further
north
the
less
inspiration
warmth
color
and
the
lightness
of
heart
that
a
generally
bright
sky
brings
enlarges
the
brain
and
makes
it
capable
of
creative
power
my
dear
sir
said
lorimer
england
does
not
possess
these
climatic
advantages
and
yet
shakespeare
was
an
englishman
he
must
have
travelled
returned
güldmar
positively
no
one
will
make
me
believe
that
the
man
never
visited
italy
his
italian
scenes
prove
it
they
are
full
of
the
place
and
the
people
the
whole
of
his
works
full
of
such
wonderful
learning
and
containing
so
many
types
of
different
nations
show
to
mind
at
least
that
countries
were
his
books
of
study
why
i
who
am
only
a
farmer
and
proprietor
of
a
bit
of
norwegian
land
i
have
learned
many
a
thing
from
simply
taking
a
glance
at
a
new
shore
each
year
that
the
way
i
used
to
amuse
myself
when
i
was
young
now
i
am
old
the
sea
tempts
me
less
and
i
am
fonder
of
my
yet
i
seen
a
good
deal
in
my
time
enough
to
provide
me
with
memories
for
my
declining
days
and
it
a
droll
thing
too
he
added
with
a
laugh
the
further
south
you
go
the
more
immoral
and
merry
are
the
people
the
further
north
the
more
virtuous
and
miserable
there
a
wrong
balance
somewhere
but
where
is
not
easy
to
find
out
weel
said
macfarlane
i
can
give
ye
a
direct
contradeection
to
your
theory
scotland
lies
to
the
north
and
ye
not
find
a
grander
harvest
o
sinfu
souls
anywhere
between
this
an
the
day
o
judgment
i
a
scotchman
an
i
just
proud
o
my
country
i
back
its
men
against
the
human
race
but
i
wadna
say
much
for
the
stabeelity
o
its
women
i
wad
just
tak
to
my
heels
and
run
if
i
saw
a
real
thumpin
scotch
lassie
makin
up
to
me
there
nae
bashfulness
in
they
sort
and
nae
safety
i
will
go
to
scotland
said
duprèz
enthusiastically
i
feel
that
those
what
do
you
call
them
will
charm
me
scotland
i
never
saw
said
güldmar
from
all
i
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
be
too
much
like
norway
after
one
eyes
have
rested
long
on
these
dark
mountains
and
glaciers
one
likes
now
and
then
to
see
a
fertile
sunshiny
stretch
of
country
such
as
france
or
the
plains
of
lombardy
of
course
there
may
be
exceptions
but
i
tell
you
climatic
influences
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
state
of
mind
and
morals
now
take
the
example
of
that
miserable
old
lovisa
elsland
she
is
the
victim
of
religious
mania
and
religious
mania
together
with
superstition
of
the
most
foolish
kind
is
common
in
norway
it
happens
often
during
the
long
winters
the
people
have
not
sufficient
to
occupy
their
minds
no
clergyman
not
even
dyceworthy
can
satisfy
the
height
of
their
fanaticism
they
preach
and
pray
and
shriek
and
groan
in
their
huts
some
swear
that
they
have
the
spirit
of
prophecy
others
that
they
are
possessed
of
devils
others
imagine
witchcraft
like
lovisa
and
altogether
there
is
such
a
howling
on
the
name
of
christ
that
i
am
glad
to
be
out
of
it
for
is
a
sight
to
awaken
the
laughter
and
contempt
of
a
pagan
such
as
i
am
thelma
listened
with
a
slight
shadow
of
pain
on
her
features
father
is
not
a
pagan
she
declared
turning
to
lorimer
how
can
one
be
pagan
if
one
believes
that
there
is
good
in
everything
and
that
nothing
happens
except
for
the
best
it
sounds
to
me
more
christian
than
pagan
averred
lorimer
with
a
smile
but
it
no
use
appealing
to
on
such
matters
miss
güldmar
i
am
an
advocate
of
the
law
of
nothing
i
remember
a
worthy
philosopher
who
when
he
was
in
his
cups
earnestly
assured
me
it
was
all
right
was
nothing
and
nothing
was
everything
are
sure
that
is
so
i
would
say
to
him
dear
young
friend
i
am
positive
i
have
worked
out
the
problem
with
care
and
he
would
shake
me
by
the
hand
warmly
with
a
mild
and
moist
smile
and
would
retire
to
bed
walking
sideways
in
the
most
amiable
manner
certain
his
ideas
were
correct
as
well
as
luminous
they
laughed
and
then
looking
up
saw
that
they
were
passing
a
portion
of
the
coast
of
seiland
which
was
more
than
usually
picturesque
facing
them
was
a
great
cavernous
cleft
in
the
rocks
tinted
with
a
curious
violet
hue
intermingled
with
bronze
and
in
the
strong
sunlight
these
colors
flashed
with
the
brilliancy
of
jewels
reflecting
themselves
in
the
pale
sea
by
errington
orders
the
yacht
slackened
speed
and
glided
along
with
an
almost
noiseless
motion
and
they
were
silent
listening
to
the
dash
and
drip
of
water
that
fell
invisibly
from
the
toppling
crags
that
frowned
above
while
the
breathless
heat
and
stillness
of
the
air
added
to
the
weird
solemnity
of
the
scene
they
all
rose
from
their
chairs
and
leaned
on
the
looking
but
uttering
no
word
in
one
of
these
islands
said
thelma
at
last
very
softly
it
was
either
seiland
or
soroe
they
once
found
the
tomb
of
a
great
chief
there
was
an
inscription
outside
that
warned
all
men
to
respect
it
but
they
laughed
at
the
warning
and
opened
the
tomb
and
they
saw
seated
in
a
stone
chair
a
skeleton
with
a
gold
crown
on
its
head
and
a
great
carved
seal
in
its
hand
and
at
its
feet
there
was
a
stone
casket
the
casket
was
broken
open
and
it
was
full
of
gold
and
jewels
well
they
took
all
the
gold
and
jewels
and
buried
the
skeleton
and
now
do
you
know
what
happens
at
midnight
a
number
of
strange
persons
are
seen
searching
on
the
shore
and
among
the
rocks
for
the
lost
treasure
and
it
is
said
they
often
utter
cries
of
anger
and
despair
and
those
who
robbed
the
tomb
all
died
suddenly
served
them
right
said
lorimer
and
now
they
are
dead
i
suppose
the
wronged
ghosts
do
appear
any
more
oh
yes
they
do
said
güldmar
very
seriously
if
any
sailor
passes
at
midnight
and
sees
them
or
hears
their
cries
he
is
doomed
but
he
see
or
hear
them
asked
errington
with
a
smile
well
i
do
know
returned
güldmar
with
a
grave
shake
of
his
head
i
not
superstitious
myself
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
say
anything
against
the
you
see
they
exist
and
it
no
use
offending
them
and
what
do
ye
mean
by
the
inquired
macfarlane
they
are
supposed
to
be
the
souls
of
persons
who
died
impenitent
said
thelma
and
they
are
doomed
to
wander
on
the
hills
till
the
day
of
judgment
it
is
a
sort
of
purgatory
duprèz
shook
his
fingers
emphatically
in
the
air
ah
bah
he
said
what
droll
things
remain
still
in
the
world
yes
in
spite
of
liberty
equality
fraternity
you
do
not
believe
in
foolish
legends
mademoiselle
for
example
do
you
think
you
will
suffer
purgatory
indeed
yes
she
replied
no
one
can
be
good
enough
to
go
straight
to
heaven
there
must
be
some
little
stop
on
the
way
in
which
to
be
sorry
for
all
the
bad
things
one
has
done
is
the
same
idea
as
ours
said
güldmar
we
have
two
places
of
punishment
in
the
norse
faith
one
which
is
a
temporary
thing
like
the
catholic
purgatory
the
other
which
is
the
counterpart
of
the
christian
hell
know
you
not
the
description
of
in
the
is
terrible
enough
to
satisfy
all
tastes
or
death
rules
over
the
nine
worlds
of
nifleheim
her
hall
is
called
grief
famine
is
her
table
and
her
only
servant
is
delay
her
gate
is
a
precipice
her
porch
faintness
her
bed
leanness
cursing
and
howling
are
her
tent
her
glance
is
dreadful
and
terrifying
and
her
lips
are
blue
with
the
venom
of
hatred
these
words
he
added
sound
finer
in
norwegian
but
i
have
given
the
meaning
fairly
ma
certes
said
macfarlane
chuckling
i
tell
my
aunt
in
glasgie
aboot
it
this
nifleheim
wad
suit
her
pairfectly
she
wad
send
a
her
relations
there
wi
tourist
tickets
not
available
for
the
return
journey
it
seems
to
me
observed
errington
that
the
nine
worlds
of
nifleheim
have
a
resemblance
to
the
different
circles
of
dante
purgatory
exactly
so
said
lorimer
all
religions
seem
to
me
to
be
more
or
less
the
same
the
question
i
can
never
settle
is
which
is
the
right
one
would
you
follow
it
if
you
knew
asked
thelma
with
a
slight
smile
lorimer
laughed
well
upon
my
life
i
do
know
he
answered
frankly
i
never
was
a
praying
sort
of
fellow
i
do
seem
to
grasp
the
idea
of
it
somehow
but
there
one
thing
i
certain
of
i
ca
endure
a
bird
without
song
a
flower
without
scent
or
a
without
religion
she
seems
to
me
no
woman
at
all
but
there
any
such
women
inquired
the
girl
surprised
yes
there
are
undoubtedly
sort
of
creatures
do
know
anything
about
them
miss
güldmar
be
thankful
now
phil
how
long
is
this
vessel
of
yours
going
to
linger
here
thus
reminded
errington
called
to
the
pilot
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
resumed
her
usual
speed
and
bore
swiftly
on
towards
soroe
this
island
dreary
and
dark
in
the
distance
grew
somewhat
more
inviting
in
aspect
on
a
nearer
approach
now
and
then
a
shaft
of
sunlight
fell
on
some
glittering
point
of
felspar
or
green
patch
of
and
valdemar
svensen
stated
that
he
knew
of
a
sandy
creek
where
if
the
party
chose
they
could
land
and
see
a
small
cave
of
exquisite
beauty
literally
hung
all
over
with
stalactites
i
never
heard
of
this
cave
said
güldmar
fixing
a
keen
eye
on
the
pilot
art
thou
a
traveller
guide
to
all
such
places
in
norway
somewhat
to
errington
surprise
svensen
changed
color
and
appeared
confused
moreover
he
removed
his
red
cap
altogether
when
he
answered
the
to
whom
he
spoke
deferentially
in
rapid
norwegian
the
old
man
laughed
as
he
listened
and
seemed
satisfied
then
turning
away
he
linked
his
arm
through
philip
and
said
you
must
pardon
him
my
lad
that
he
spoke
in
your
presence
a
tongue
unfamiliar
to
you
no
offense
was
meant
he
is
of
my
creed
but
fears
to
make
it
known
lest
he
should
lose
all
employment
which
is
likely
enough
seeing
that
so
many
of
the
people
are
fanatics
moreover
he
is
bound
to
me
by
an
oath
which
in
olden
days
would
have
made
him
my
serf
but
which
leaves
him
free
enough
just
now
with
one
exception
and
that
exception
asked
errington
with
some
interest
is
that
should
i
ever
demand
a
certain
service
at
his
hands
he
dare
not
refuse
it
odd
is
it
or
so
it
seems
to
you
and
güldmar
pressed
the
young
man
arm
lightly
and
kindly
but
our
norse
oaths
are
taken
with
great
solemnity
and
are
as
binding
as
the
obligation
of
death
itself
however
i
have
not
commanded
valdemar
obedience
yet
nor
do
i
think
i
am
likely
to
do
so
for
some
time
he
is
a
fine
faithful
fellow
though
too
much
given
to
dreams
a
gay
chorus
of
laughter
here
broke
from
the
little
group
seated
on
deck
of
which
thelma
was
the
centre
and
güldmar
stopped
in
his
walk
with
an
attentive
smile
on
his
open
ruddy
countenance
is
good
for
the
heart
to
hear
the
merriment
of
young
folks
he
said
think
you
not
my
girl
laugh
is
like
the
ripple
of
a
lark
song
just
so
clear
and
joyous
her
voice
is
music
itself
declared
philip
quickly
and
warmly
there
is
nothing
she
says
or
does
or
looks
that
is
not
absolutely
beautiful
then
suddenly
aware
of
his
precipitation
he
stopped
abruptly
his
face
flushed
as
güldmar
regarded
him
fixedly
with
a
musing
and
doubtful
air
but
whatever
the
old
man
thought
he
said
nothing
he
merely
held
the
young
baronet
arm
a
little
closer
and
together
they
joined
the
others
though
it
was
noticeable
that
during
the
rest
of
the
day
the
was
rather
abstracted
and
serious
and
that
every
now
and
then
his
eyes
rested
on
his
daughter
face
with
an
expression
of
tender
yearning
and
melancholy
it
was
about
two
hours
after
luncheon
that
the
approached
the
creek
spoken
of
by
the
pilot
and
they
were
all
fascinated
by
the
loveliness
as
well
as
by
the
fierce
grandeur
of
the
scene
the
rocks
on
that
portion
of
soroe
appeared
to
have
split
violently
asunder
to
admit
some
great
passage
of
the
sea
and
were
piled
up
in
toppling
terraces
to
the
height
of
more
than
two
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
water
beneath
these
wild
and
craggy
fortresses
of
nature
a
shining
stretch
of
beach
had
formed
itself
on
which
the
fine
white
sand
mixed
with
crushed
felspar
sparkled
like
powdered
silver
on
the
side
of
this
beach
could
be
distinctly
seen
the
round
opening
of
the
cavern
to
which
valdemar
svensen
directed
their
attention
they
decided
to
visit
it
the
yacht
was
brought
to
a
standstill
and
the
lowered
they
took
no
sailors
with
them
errington
and
his
companions
rowing
four
oars
while
thelma
and
her
father
occupied
the
stern
a
landing
was
easily
effected
and
they
walked
toward
the
cavern
treading
on
thousands
of
beautiful
little
shells
which
strewed
the
sand
beneath
their
feet
there
was
a
deep
stillness
everywhere
the
island
was
so
desolate
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
very
seabirds
refused
to
make
their
homes
in
the
black
clefts
of
such
steep
and
barren
rocks
at
the
entrance
of
the
little
cave
güldmar
looked
back
to
the
sea
there
a
storm
coming
he
announced
those
clouds
we
saw
this
morning
have
sailed
thither
almost
as
quickly
as
ourselves
the
sky
had
indeed
grown
darker
and
little
wrinkling
waves
disturbed
the
surface
of
the
water
but
the
sun
as
yet
retained
his
sovereignty
and
there
was
no
wind
by
the
pilot
advice
errington
and
his
friends
had
provided
themselves
each
with
a
pine
torch
in
order
to
light
up
the
cavern
as
soon
as
they
found
themselves
within
it
the
smoky
crimson
flare
illuminated
what
seemed
at
a
first
glance
to
be
a
miniature
fairy
palace
studded
thickly
with
clusters
of
diamonds
long
pointed
stalactites
hung
from
the
roof
at
almost
mathematically
even
distances
from
one
another
the
walls
glistened
with
varying
shades
of
pink
and
green
and
violet
and
in
the
very
midst
of
the
cave
was
a
still
pool
of
water
in
which
all
the
fantastic
forms
and
hues
of
the
place
mirrored
themselves
in
miniature
in
one
corner
the
stalactites
had
clustered
into
the
shape
of
a
large
chair
overhung
by
a
canopy
and
duprèz
perceiving
it
exclaimed
he
listened
and
seemed
satisfied
then
turning
away
he
linked
his
arm
through
philip
and
said
a
queen
throne
come
mademoiselle
güldmar
you
must
sit
in
it
but
i
am
not
a
queen
laughed
thelma
a
throne
is
for
a
king
will
not
sir
phillip
sit
there
there
a
compliment
for
you
phil
cried
lorrimer
waving
his
torch
enthusiastically
let
us
awaken
the
echoes
with
the
shout
of
live
the
king
but
errington
approached
thelma
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
said
gently
come
let
us
see
you
throned
in
state
queen
thelma
to
please
me
come
she
looked
up
the
flame
of
the
bright
torch
he
carried
illumined
his
face
on
which
love
had
written
what
she
could
not
fail
to
read
but
she
trembled
as
with
cold
and
there
was
a
kind
of
appalling
wonder
in
her
troubled
eyes
he
whispered
come
queen
thelma
as
in
a
dream
she
allowed
him
to
lead
her
to
the
stalactite
chair
and
when
she
was
seated
therein
she
endeavored
to
control
the
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
and
to
smile
unconcernedly
on
the
little
group
that
surrounded
her
with
shouts
of
mingled
mirth
and
admiration
ye
look
just
fine
said
macfarlane
with
undisguised
delight
mak
a
grand
picture
would
she
errington
phillip
gazed
at
her
but
said
nothing
his
head
was
too
full
sitting
there
among
the
glittering
intertwisted
and
suspended
rocks
with
the
blaze
from
the
torches
flashing
on
her
winsome
face
and
luxuriant
hair
with
that
look
in
her
eyes
and
an
uncertain
shadowy
smile
quivering
on
her
sweet
lips
the
girl
looked
almost
dangerously
lovely
helen
of
troy
could
scarce
have
fired
more
passionate
emotion
among
the
heroes
than
she
unconsciously
excited
at
that
moment
in
the
minds
of
all
who
beheld
her
duprèz
for
once
understood
what
it
was
to
reverence
a
woman
beauty
and
decided
that
the
flippant
language
of
compliment
was
out
of
place
he
therefore
said
nothing
and
lorrimer
too
was
silent
battling
bravely
against
the
wild
desires
that
were
now
in
his
opinion
nothing
but
disloyalty
to
his
friend
old
güldmar
hearty
voice
roused
and
startled
them
all
now
thelma
child
if
thou
art
a
queen
give
orders
to
these
lads
to
be
moving
is
a
damp
place
to
hold
a
court
in
and
thy
throne
must
needs
be
a
cold
one
let
us
out
to
the
blessed
sunshine
again
maybe
we
can
climb
one
of
yon
wild
rocks
and
get
a
view
worth
seeing
all
right
sir
said
lorimer
chivalrously
resolving
that
now
errington
should
have
a
chance
come
on
mac
pierre
güldmar
exacts
our
obedience
phil
you
take
care
of
the
queen
and
skillfully
pushing
on
duprèz
and
macfarlane
before
him
he
followed
güldmar
who
preceded
them
all
thus
leaving
his
friend
in
a
momentary
comparative
solitude
with
thelma
the
girl
was
a
little
startled
as
she
saw
them
thus
taking
their
departure
and
sprang
up
from
her
stalactite
throne
in
haste
sir
philip
had
laid
aside
his
torch
in
order
to
assist
her
with
both
hands
to
descend
the
sloping
rocks
but
her
embarrassment
at
being
left
almost
alone
with
him
made
her
nervous
and
uncertain
of
foot
she
was
hurried
and
agitated
and
anxious
to
overtake
the
others
and
in
trying
to
walk
quickly
she
slipped
and
nearly
fell
in
one
second
she
was
caught
in
his
arms
and
clasped
passionately
to
his
heart
thelma
thelma
he
whispered
i
love
you
my
darling
i
love
you
she
trembled
in
his
strong
embrace
and
strove
to
release
herself
but
he
pressed
her
more
closely
to
him
scarcely
knowing
that
he
did
so
but
feeling
that
he
held
the
world
life
time
happiness
and
salvation
in
this
one
fair
creature
his
brain
was
in
a
wild
whirl
the
glitter
of
the
stalactite
cave
turned
to
a
gyrating
wheel
of
there
was
nothing
any
more
no
universe
no
existence
nothing
but
love
love
love
beating
strong
through
every
fibre
of
his
frame
he
glanced
up
and
saw
that
the
slowly
retreating
forms
of
his
friends
had
nearly
reached
the
outer
opening
of
the
cavern
once
there
they
would
look
back
and
quick
thelma
and
his
warm
breath
touched
her
cheek
my
darling
my
love
if
you
are
not
angry
kiss
me
i
shall
understand
she
hesitated
to
philip
that
instant
of
hesitation
seemed
a
cycle
of
slow
revolving
years
timidly
she
lifted
her
head
she
was
very
pale
and
her
breath
came
and
went
quickly
he
gazed
at
her
in
speechless
suspense
and
saw
as
in
a
vision
the
pure
radiance
of
her
face
and
eyes
shining
more
and
more
closely
upon
him
then
came
a
touch
soft
and
sweet
as
a
roseleaf
pressed
against
his
lips
and
for
one
mad
moment
he
remembered
nothing
he
was
caught
up
like
paris
in
a
cloud
of
gold
and
knew
not
which
was
earth
or
heaven
you
love
me
thelma
he
murmured
in
a
sort
of
wondering
rapture
i
can
not
believe
it
sweet
tell
me
you
love
me
she
looked
up
a
new
unspeakable
glory
flushed
her
face
and
her
eyes
glowed
with
the
mute
eloquence
of
awakening
passion
love
you
she
said
in
a
voice
so
low
and
sweet
that
it
might
have
been
the
whisper
of
a
passing
fairy
ah
yes
more
than
my
life
chapter
xiv
sweet
hands
sweet
hair
sweet
cheeks
sweet
eyes
sweet
mouth
each
singly
wooed
and
won
dante
rosetti
hallo
ho
shouted
güldmar
vociferously
peering
back
into
the
shadows
of
the
cavern
from
whence
the
figures
of
his
daughter
and
errington
were
seen
presently
emerging
why
what
kept
you
so
long
my
lad
we
thought
you
were
close
behind
us
where
your
torch
it
went
out
replied
philip
promptly
as
he
assisted
thelma
with
grave
and
ceremonious
politeness
to
cross
over
some
rough
stones
at
the
entrance
and
we
had
some
trouble
to
find
our
way
ye
might
hae
called
to
us
i
the
way
o
friendship
observed
macfarlane
somewhat
suspiciously
and
we
wad
hae
lighted
ye
through
oh
it
was
no
matter
said
thelma
with
a
charming
smile
sir
philip
seemed
well
to
know
the
way
and
it
was
not
so
very
dark
lorimer
glanced
at
her
and
read
plainly
all
that
was
written
in
her
happy
face
his
heart
sank
a
little
but
noticing
that
the
old
was
studying
his
daughter
with
a
slight
air
of
vexation
and
surprise
he
loyally
determined
to
divert
the
general
attention
from
her
bright
blushes
and
too
brilliantly
sparkling
eyes
well
here
you
both
are
at
any
rate
he
said
lightly
and
i
should
strongly
advise
that
we
attempt
no
more
exploration
of
the
island
of
soroe
look
at
the
sky
and
just
now
there
was
a
clap
of
thunder
thunder
exclaimed
errington
i
never
heard
it
i
dare
say
not
said
lorimer
with
a
quiet
smile
still
heard
it
pretty
distinctly
and
i
think
we
better
make
for
the
yacht
all
right
and
sir
philip
sprang
gaily
into
the
to
arrange
the
cushions
in
the
stern
for
thelma
never
had
he
looked
handsomer
or
more
and
his
elation
was
noticed
by
all
his
companions
something
joyous
has
happened
to
our
said
duprèz
in
a
he
is
in
the
air
and
something
in
the
ither
way
has
happened
vera
suddenly
to
güldmar
returned
macfarlane
th
auld
man
is
in
the
dumps
the
face
in
truth
looked
sad
and
somewhat
stern
he
scarcely
spoke
at
all
as
he
took
his
place
in
the
boat
beside
his
daughter
once
he
raised
her
little
hand
looked
at
it
and
kissed
it
fondly
they
were
all
soon
on
their
way
back
to
the
over
a
sea
that
had
grown
rough
and
during
their
visit
to
the
stalactite
cave
clouds
had
gathered
thickly
over
the
sky
and
though
a
few
shafts
of
sunlight
still
forced
a
passage
through
them
the
threatening
darkness
spread
with
steady
persistency
especially
to
the
northern
side
of
the
horizon
where
storm
hovered
in
the
shape
of
a
black
wing
edged
with
coppery
crimson
as
they
reached
the
yacht
a
silver
glare
of
lightning
sprang
forth
from
beneath
this
sable
pinion
and
a
few
large
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
errington
hurried
thelma
on
deck
and
down
into
the
saloon
his
friends
with
güldmar
followed
and
the
vessel
was
soon
plunging
through
waves
of
no
small
height
on
her
way
back
to
the
altenfjord
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
like
a
salvo
of
artillery
accompanied
their
departure
from
soroe
and
thelma
shivered
a
little
as
she
heard
it
you
are
nervous
mademoiselle
güldmar
asked
duprèz
noticing
her
tremor
oh
no
she
answered
brightly
nervous
that
is
to
be
afraid
i
am
not
afraid
of
a
storm
but
i
do
not
like
it
it
is
a
cruel
fierce
thing
and
i
should
have
wished
to
be
all
sunshine
all
gladness
she
paused
and
her
eyes
grew
soft
and
humid
then
you
have
been
happy
said
lorimer
in
a
low
and
very
gentle
voice
she
smiled
up
at
him
from
the
depths
of
the
velvet
lounge
in
which
errington
had
placed
her
happy
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
been
so
happy
before
she
paused
and
a
bright
blush
crimsoned
her
cheeks
then
seeing
the
piano
open
she
said
suddenly
shall
i
sing
to
you
or
perhaps
you
are
all
tired
and
would
rather
rest
music
rest
said
lorimer
rather
dreamily
watching
her
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
a
tall
supple
lithe
figure
and
moved
towards
the
instrument
and
voice
miss
güldmar
would
soothe
the
most
weary
soul
that
ever
dwelt
in
clay
she
glanced
round
at
him
surprised
at
his
sad
tone
ah
you
are
very
very
tired
lorimer
i
am
sure
i
will
sing
you
a
norse
to
make
you
go
to
sleep
you
will
not
understand
the
words
though
will
that
matter
not
in
the
least
answered
lorimer
with
a
smile
the
london
girls
sing
in
german
italian
spanish
and
english
nobody
knows
what
they
are
saying
they
scarcely
know
themselves
but
it
all
right
and
quite
fashionable
thelma
laughed
gaily
how
funny
she
exclaimed
it
is
to
amuse
people
i
suppose
well
now
listen
and
playing
a
soft
prelude
her
rich
contralto
rippled
forth
in
a
tender
passionate
melancholy
melody
so
sweet
and
that
the
practical
macfarlane
sat
as
one
in
a
dream
duprèz
forgot
to
finish
making
the
cigarette
he
was
daintily
manipulating
between
his
fingers
and
lorimer
had
much
ado
to
keep
tears
from
his
eyes
from
one
song
she
glided
to
another
and
yet
another
her
soul
seemed
possessed
by
the
very
spirit
of
music
meanwhile
errington
in
obedience
to
an
imperative
sign
from
old
güldmar
left
the
saloon
with
him
once
outside
the
doors
the
said
in
a
somewhat
agitated
voice
i
desire
to
speak
to
you
sir
philip
alone
and
undisturbed
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
by
all
means
answered
philip
come
to
my
on
deck
we
shall
be
quite
solitary
there
he
led
the
way
and
olaf
güldmar
followed
him
in
silence
it
was
raining
fiercely
and
the
waves
green
towers
of
strength
broke
every
now
and
then
over
the
sides
of
the
yacht
with
a
hissing
shower
of
salt
white
spray
the
thunder
rolled
along
the
sky
in
angry
reverberating
echoes
frequent
flashes
of
lightning
leaped
out
like
swords
drawn
from
dark
scabbards
yet
towards
the
south
the
sky
was
clearing
and
arrowy
beams
of
pale
gold
fell
from
the
hidden
sun
with
a
soothing
and
soft
lustre
on
the
breast
of
the
troubled
water
güldmar
looked
about
him
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
refreshment
his
eyes
rested
lovingly
on
the
tumbling
billows
he
bared
his
white
head
to
the
wind
and
rain
this
is
the
life
the
blood
the
heart
of
a
man
he
said
while
a
sort
of
fierce
delight
shone
in
his
keen
eyes
to
battle
with
the
tempest
to
laugh
at
the
wrath
of
waters
to
set
one
face
against
the
wild
wind
to
sport
with
the
elements
as
though
they
were
children
or
serfs
this
is
the
joy
of
manhood
a
joy
he
added
slowly
that
few
men
of
can
ever
feel
errington
smiled
gravely
perhaps
you
are
right
sir
he
said
but
perhaps
at
the
same
time
you
forget
that
life
has
grown
very
bitter
to
all
of
us
during
the
last
hundred
years
or
so
maybe
the
world
is
getting
old
and
used
up
maybe
the
fault
is
in
ourselves
but
it
is
certain
that
none
of
us
nowadays
are
particularly
happy
except
at
rare
intervals
when
at
that
moment
in
a
lull
of
the
storm
thelma
voice
pealed
upwards
from
the
saloon
she
was
singing
a
french
song
and
the
refrain
rang
out
clearly
ah
le
doux
son
baiser
tendre
errington
paused
abruptly
in
his
speech
and
turning
towards
a
little
closed
and
covered
place
on
deck
which
was
half
cabin
half
and
which
he
kept
as
his
own
private
sanctum
he
unlocked
it
saying
will
you
come
in
here
sir
it
not
very
spacious
but
i
think
just
the
place
for
a
chat
especially
a
private
one
güldmar
entered
but
did
not
sit
down
errington
shut
the
door
against
the
rain
and
beating
spray
and
also
remained
standing
after
a
pause
during
which
the
seemed
struggling
with
some
inward
emotion
he
said
resolutely
sir
philip
you
are
a
young
man
and
i
am
an
old
one
i
would
not
willingly
offend
you
for
i
like
you
yes
and
the
old
man
looked
up
frankly
i
like
you
enough
to
respect
you
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
to
many
men
i
have
known
but
i
have
a
weight
on
my
heart
that
must
be
lifted
you
and
my
child
have
been
much
together
for
many
days
and
i
was
an
old
fool
not
to
have
foreseen
the
influence
your
companionship
might
have
upon
her
i
may
be
mistaken
in
the
idea
that
has
taken
hold
of
me
some
wild
words
let
fall
by
the
poor
boy
sigurd
this
morning
when
he
entreated
my
pardon
for
his
misconduct
of
yesterday
have
perhaps
misled
my
judgment
but
by
the
gods
i
can
not
put
it
into
suitable
words
i
you
think
i
love
your
daughter
said
sir
philip
quietly
you
are
not
mistaken
sir
i
love
her
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
i
want
you
to
give
her
to
me
as
my
wife
a
change
passed
over
the
old
farmer
face
he
grew
deathly
pale
and
put
out
one
hand
feebly
as
though
to
seek
some
support
errington
caught
it
in
his
own
and
pressed
it
hard
surely
you
are
not
surprised
sir
he
added
with
eagerness
how
can
i
help
loving
her
she
is
the
best
and
loveliest
girl
i
have
ever
seen
believe
me
i
would
make
her
happy
and
have
you
thought
young
man
returned
güldmar
slowly
that
you
would
make
me
desolate
or
thinking
it
have
you
cared
there
was
an
infinite
pathos
in
his
voice
and
errington
was
touched
and
silent
he
found
no
answer
to
this
reproach
güldmar
sat
down
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
let
me
think
a
little
he
said
my
mind
is
confused
a
bit
i
was
not
prepared
for
he
paused
and
seemed
lost
in
sorrowful
meditation
he
looked
up
and
meeting
errington
anxious
gaze
he
broke
into
a
short
laugh
do
mind
me
my
lad
he
said
sturdily
is
a
blow
you
see
i
had
not
thought
so
far
as
this
i
tell
you
the
plain
truth
and
you
must
forgive
me
for
wronging
you
i
know
what
young
blood
is
all
the
world
over
a
fair
face
fires
it
and
impulse
makes
it
gallop
beyond
control
was
so
with
me
when
i
was
your
age
though
no
woman
i
hope
was
ever
the
worse
for
my
harmless
lovemaking
but
thelma
is
different
from
most
women
she
has
a
strange
nature
moreover
she
has
a
heart
and
a
memory
if
she
once
learns
the
meaning
of
love
she
will
never
unlearn
the
lesson
now
i
thought
that
like
most
young
men
of
your
type
you
might
without
meaning
any
actual
evil
trifle
with
her
play
with
her
feelings
i
understand
sir
said
philip
coolly
without
displaying
any
offense
to
put
it
plainly
in
spite
of
your
liking
for
me
you
thought
me
a
snob
this
time
the
old
man
laughed
heartily
and
unforcedly
dear
dear
he
exclaimed
you
are
what
is
termed
in
your
own
land
a
peppery
customer
never
mind
i
like
it
why
my
lad
the
men
of
think
it
fair
sport
to
trifle
with
a
pretty
woman
now
and
then
pardon
interrupted
philip
curtly
i
must
defend
my
sex
we
occasionally
trifle
with
those
women
who
show
us
that
they
wish
to
be
trifled
with
but
never
with
those
who
like
your
daughter
win
every
man
respect
and
reverence
güldmar
rose
and
grasped
his
hand
fervently
by
all
the
gods
i
believe
you
are
a
true
gentleman
he
said
i
ask
your
pardon
if
i
have
offended
you
by
so
much
as
a
thought
but
now
and
his
face
grew
very
serious
we
must
talk
this
matter
over
i
will
not
speak
of
the
suddenness
of
your
love
for
my
child
because
i
know
from
my
own
past
experience
that
love
is
a
rapid
impulse
a
flame
ignited
in
a
moment
yes
i
know
that
well
he
paused
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
but
he
soon
steadied
it
and
went
on
i
think
however
my
lad
that
you
have
been
a
little
hasty
for
instance
have
you
thought
what
your
english
friends
and
relatives
will
say
to
your
marrying
a
farmer
daughter
who
though
she
has
the
blood
of
kings
in
her
veins
is
nevertheless
as
this
present
world
would
judge
beneath
you
in
social
standing
i
say
have
you
thought
of
this
philip
smiled
proudly
certainly
sir
i
have
thought
of
any
such
trifle
as
the
opinion
of
society
if
that
is
what
you
mean
i
have
no
relatives
to
please
or
displease
no
friends
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
world
except
lorimer
i
have
a
long
list
of
acquaintances
undoubtedly
infinite
bores
most
of
them
and
whether
they
approve
or
disapprove
of
my
actions
is
to
me
a
matter
of
profound
indifference
see
you
said
the
firmly
and
earnestly
it
would
be
an
ill
day
for
me
if
i
gave
my
little
one
to
a
husband
who
might
mind
i
only
say
in
the
course
of
years
regret
having
married
her
regret
cried
philip
excitedly
then
quieting
down
he
said
gently
my
good
friend
i
do
not
think
you
understand
me
you
talk
as
if
thelma
were
beneath
good
god
it
is
who
am
infinitely
beneath
i
am
utterly
unworthy
of
her
in
every
way
i
assure
you
and
i
tell
you
so
frankly
i
have
led
a
useless
life
and
a
more
or
less
selfish
one
i
have
principally
sought
to
amuse
and
interest
myself
all
through
it
i
had
my
vices
too
and
have
them
still
beside
thelma
innocent
white
soul
mine
looks
villainous
but
i
can
honestly
say
i
never
knew
what
love
was
till
i
saw
her
and
now
well
i
would
give
my
life
away
gladly
to
save
her
from
even
a
small
sorrow
i
believe
you
i
thoroughly
believe
you
said
güldmar
i
see
you
love
the
child
the
gods
forbid
that
i
should
stand
in
the
way
of
her
happiness
i
am
getting
old
and
was
often
a
sore
point
with
me
to
know
what
would
become
of
my
darling
when
i
was
gone
for
she
is
fair
to
look
upon
and
there
are
many
human
wolves
ready
to
devour
such
lambs
still
my
lad
you
must
learn
all
do
you
know
what
is
said
of
me
in
bosekop
errington
smiled
and
nodded
in
the
affirmative
you
do
exclaimed
the
old
man
somewhat
surprised
you
know
they
say
i
killed
my
wife
my
wife
the
creature
before
whom
my
soul
knelt
in
worship
night
and
day
whose
bright
head
was
the
sunlight
of
life
let
me
tell
you
of
her
sir
philip
is
a
simple
story
she
was
the
child
of
my
dearest
friend
and
many
years
younger
than
myself
this
friend
of
mine
erik
erlandsen
was
the
captain
of
a
stout
norwegian
barque
running
constantly
between
these
wild
waters
and
the
coast
of
france
he
fell
in
love
with
and
married
a
beauty
from
the
sogne
fjord
he
carried
her
secretly
away
from
her
parents
who
would
not
consent
to
the
marriage
she
was
a
timid
creature
in
spite
of
her
queenly
ways
and
for
fear
of
her
parents
she
would
never
land
again
on
the
shores
of
norway
she
grew
to
love
france
and
erik
often
left
her
there
in
some
safe
shelter
when
he
was
bound
on
some
extra
long
and
stormy
passage
she
took
to
the
catholic
creed
too
in
france
and
learned
to
speak
the
french
tongue
so
erik
said
as
though
it
were
her
own
at
the
time
of
the
expected
birth
of
her
child
her
husband
had
taken
her
far
inland
to
arles
and
there
business
compelled
him
to
leave
her
for
some
days
when
he
returned
she
was
dead
laid
out
for
burial
with
flowers
and
tapers
round
her
he
fell
prone
on
her
body
insensible
and
not
for
many
hours
did
the
people
of
the
place
dare
to
tell
him
that
he
was
the
father
of
a
living
child
a
girl
with
the
great
blue
eyes
and
white
skin
of
her
mother
he
would
scarce
look
at
it
but
at
last
when
roused
a
bit
he
carried
the
little
thing
in
his
arms
to
the
great
convent
at
arles
and
giving
the
nuns
money
he
bade
them
take
it
and
bring
it
up
as
they
would
only
giving
it
the
name
of
thelma
then
poor
erlandsen
came
home
he
sought
me
out
he
said
i
feel
that
i
am
going
on
my
last
voyage
promise
you
will
see
to
my
child
guard
her
if
you
can
from
an
evil
fate
for
me
there
is
no
future
i
promised
and
strove
to
cheer
him
but
he
spoke
truly
his
ship
went
down
in
a
storm
on
the
bay
of
biscay
and
all
on
board
were
lost
then
it
was
that
i
commenced
my
journeyings
to
and
fro
to
see
the
little
maiden
that
was
growing
up
in
the
convent
at
arles
i
watched
her
for
sixteen
years
and
when
she
reached
her
seventeenth
birthday
i
married
her
and
brought
her
to
norway
and
she
was
thelma
mother
said
errington
with
interest
she
was
thelma
mother
returned
the
and
she
was
more
beautiful
than
even
thelma
is
now
her
education
had
been
almost
entirely
french
but
as
a
child
she
had
learnt
that
i
generally
spoke
english
and
as
there
happened
to
be
an
english
nun
in
the
convent
she
studied
that
language
and
mastered
it
for
the
love
of
me
yes
he
repeated
with
musing
tenderness
all
for
the
love
of
me
for
she
loved
me
sir
philip
ay
as
passionately
as
i
loved
her
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
we
lived
a
solitary
happy
life
but
we
did
not
mix
with
our
neighbors
our
creeds
were
different
our
ways
apart
from
theirs
we
had
some
time
of
perfect
happiness
together
three
years
passed
before
our
child
was
born
and
then
the
paused
awhile
and
again
continued
then
my
wife
health
grew
frail
and
uncertain
she
liked
to
be
in
the
fresh
air
and
was
fond
of
wandering
about
the
hills
with
her
little
one
in
her
arms
one
day
shall
i
ever
forget
it
when
thelma
was
about
two
and
a
half
years
old
i
missed
them
both
and
went
out
to
search
for
them
fearing
my
wife
had
lost
her
way
and
knowing
that
our
child
could
not
toddle
far
without
fatigue
i
found
them
the
but
how
my
wife
had
slipped
and
fallen
through
a
chasm
in
the
rocks
high
enough
indeed
to
have
killed
her
she
was
alive
but
injured
for
life
she
lay
there
white
and
motionless
little
thelma
meanwhile
sat
smilingly
on
the
edge
of
the
rock
assuring
me
that
her
mother
had
gone
to
sleep
well
and
güldmar
brushed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
carried
my
darling
home
in
my
arms
a
wreck
she
lingered
for
ten
years
of
patient
suffering
ten
long
years
she
could
only
move
about
on
crutches
the
beauty
of
her
figure
was
gone
but
the
beauty
of
her
face
grew
more
perfect
every
day
never
again
was
she
seen
on
the
hills
and
so
to
the
silly
folks
of
bosekop
she
seemed
to
have
disappeared
indeed
i
kept
her
very
existence
a
secret
i
could
not
endure
that
others
should
hear
of
the
destruction
of
all
that
marvellous
grace
and
queenly
loveliness
she
lived
long
enough
to
see
her
daughter
blossom
into
girlhood
then
she
died
i
could
not
bear
to
have
her
laid
in
the
damp
wormy
earth
you
know
in
our
creed
is
not
practiced
so
i
laid
her
tenderly
away
in
a
king
tomb
of
antiquity
a
tomb
known
only
to
myself
and
one
who
assisted
me
to
lay
her
in
her
last
there
she
sleeps
right
royally
and
now
is
your
mind
relieved
my
lad
for
the
reports
of
the
bosekop
folk
must
certainly
have
awakened
some
suspicions
in
your
mind
your
story
has
interested
me
deeply
sir
said
errington
but
i
assure
you
i
never
had
any
suspicions
of
you
at
all
i
always
disregard
gossip
it
is
generally
scandalous
and
seldom
true
besides
i
took
your
face
on
trust
as
you
took
mine
then
declared
güldmar
with
a
smile
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
except
and
he
stretched
out
both
hands
may
the
great
gods
prosper
your
wooing
you
offer
a
fairer
fate
to
thelma
than
i
had
dreamed
of
for
her
but
i
know
not
what
the
child
herself
may
say
philip
interrupted
him
his
eyes
flashed
and
he
smiled
she
loves
me
he
said
simply
güldmar
looked
at
him
laughed
a
little
and
sighed
she
loves
thee
he
said
relapsing
into
the
and
he
was
wont
to
use
with
his
daughter
thou
hast
lost
no
time
my
lad
when
didst
thou
find
that
out
returned
philip
with
that
same
triumphant
smile
playing
about
his
lips
she
told
me
so
yet
even
now
i
can
not
believe
it
ah
well
thou
mayest
believe
it
truly
said
güldmar
for
thelma
says
nothing
that
she
does
not
mean
the
child
has
never
stooped
to
even
the
smallest
falsehood
errington
seemed
lost
in
a
happy
dream
suddenly
he
roused
himself
and
took
güldmar
by
the
arm
come
he
said
let
us
go
to
her
she
will
wonder
why
we
are
so
long
absent
see
the
storm
has
cleared
the
sun
is
shining
it
is
understood
you
will
give
her
to
me
foolish
lad
said
güldmar
gently
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
she
has
given
herself
to
thee
love
has
overwhelmed
both
of
your
hearts
and
before
the
strong
sweep
of
such
an
ocean
what
can
an
old
man
life
avail
nothing
less
than
nothing
besides
i
be
happy
if
i
have
regrets
if
i
feel
the
tooth
of
sorrow
biting
at
my
heart
is
naught
but
selfishness
is
my
own
dread
of
parting
with
her
his
voice
trembled
and
his
fine
face
quivered
with
suppressed
emotion
errington
pressed
his
arm
our
house
shall
be
yours
sir
he
said
eagerly
why
not
leave
this
place
and
come
with
us
güldmar
shook
his
head
leave
norway
he
said
leave
the
land
of
my
fathers
turn
my
back
on
these
mountains
and
fjords
and
glaziers
never
no
no
my
lad
you
and
generous
as
becomes
you
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
but
be
impossible
i
should
be
like
a
caged
eagle
breaking
my
wings
against
the
bars
of
english
conventionalities
besides
young
birds
must
make
their
nest
without
interference
from
the
old
ones
he
stepped
out
on
deck
as
errington
opened
the
little
cabin
door
and
his
features
kindled
with
enthusiasm
as
he
looked
on
the
stretch
of
dark
mountain
scenery
around
him
illumined
by
the
brilliant
beams
of
the
sun
that
shone
out
now
in
full
splendor
as
though
in
glorious
defiance
of
the
retreating
storm
which
had
gradually
rolled
away
in
clouds
that
were
tumbling
one
over
the
other
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
northern
horizon
like
vanquished
armies
taking
to
hasty
flight
could
i
stand
the
orderly
tameness
of
your
green
england
think
you
after
this
he
exclaimed
with
a
comprehensive
gesture
of
his
hand
no
no
when
death
comes
and
not
be
long
coming
let
it
find
me
with
my
face
turned
to
the
mountains
and
nothing
but
their
kingly
crests
between
me
and
the
blessed
sky
come
my
lad
and
he
relapsed
into
his
ordinary
tone
if
thou
art
like
me
when
i
was
thy
age
every
minute
passed
away
from
thy
love
seems
an
eternity
let
us
go
to
her
we
had
best
wait
till
the
decks
are
dry
before
we
assemble
up
here
again
they
descended
at
once
into
the
saloon
where
they
found
thelma
being
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
chess
by
duprèz
while
macfarlane
and
lorimer
looked
idly
on
she
glanced
up
from
the
board
as
her
father
and
errington
entered
and
smiled
at
them
both
with
a
slightly
heightened
color
this
is
such
a
wonderful
game
father
she
said
and
i
am
so
stupid
i
can
not
understand
it
so
monsieur
pierre
is
trying
to
make
me
remember
the
moves
nothing
is
easier
declared
duprèz
i
was
showing
you
how
the
bishop
goes
so
and
he
illustrated
his
lesson
he
is
a
dignitary
of
the
church
you
perceive
it
follows
that
he
can
not
go
in
a
straight
line
if
you
observe
them
well
you
will
see
that
all
the
religious
gentlemen
play
at
cross
purposes
you
are
very
quick
mademoiselle
güldmar
you
have
perfectly
comprehended
the
move
of
the
castle
and
the
pretty
plunge
of
the
knight
now
as
i
told
you
the
queen
can
do
anything
all
the
pieces
shiver
in
their
shoes
before
her
why
she
asked
feeling
a
little
embarrassed
as
sir
philip
came
and
sat
beside
her
looking
at
her
with
an
undoubtedly
composed
air
of
absolute
proprietorship
why
the
reason
is
simple
answered
pierre
the
queen
is
a
woman
everything
must
give
way
to
her
wish
and
the
king
she
inquired
ah
pauvre
roi
he
can
do
very
little
almost
nothing
he
can
only
move
one
step
at
a
time
and
that
with
much
labor
and
hesitation
he
is
the
wooden
image
of
louis
xvi
then
said
the
girl
quickly
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
protect
a
king
who
is
not
worth
protecting
duprèz
laughed
exactly
and
thus
in
this
charming
game
you
have
the
history
of
many
nations
mademoiselle
güldmar
has
put
the
matter
excellently
chess
is
for
those
who
intend
to
form
republics
all
the
worry
and
calculation
all
the
moves
of
pawns
bishops
knights
castles
and
queens
all
to
shelter
the
throne
which
is
not
worth
protecting
excellent
mademoiselle
you
are
not
in
favor
of
monarchies
i
do
not
know
said
thelma
i
have
never
thought
of
such
things
but
kings
should
be
great
men
wise
and
powerful
better
and
braver
than
all
their
subjects
should
they
not
undoubtedly
remarked
lorimer
but
it
a
curious
thing
they
seldom
are
now
our
queen
god
bless
her
hear
hear
interrupted
errington
laughing
i
have
a
word
said
against
the
dear
old
lady
lorimer
granted
that
she
hates
london
and
sees
no
fun
in
being
stared
at
by
vulgar
crowds
i
think
she
quite
right
and
i
sympathize
heartily
with
her
liking
for
a
cup
of
tea
in
peace
and
quiet
with
some
old
scotch
body
who
care
whether
she
a
queen
or
a
washerwoman
i
think
said
macfarlane
slowly
that
royalty
has
its
duties
ye
see
an
though
i
canna
say
i
object
to
her
majesty
homely
way
o
behavin
still
there
are
a
few
matters
that
wad
be
the
better
for
her
pairsonal
attention
oh
bother
said
errington
gaily
look
at
that
victim
of
the
nation
the
prince
of
wales
the
poor
fellow
has
a
moment
peace
of
his
life
what
with
laying
foundation
stones
opening
museums
inspecting
this
and
visiting
that
he
is
like
a
costermonger
donkey
that
must
or
as
his
master
the
people
bid
if
he
smiles
at
a
woman
it
is
instantly
reported
that
he
in
love
with
her
if
he
frankly
says
he
considers
her
pretty
there
no
end
to
the
scandal
poor
royal
wretch
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
the
unwashed
classes
who
clamor
for
shortened
hours
of
labor
and
want
work
to
be
expressly
invented
for
their
benefit
do
suffer
a
bit
more
than
albert
edward
who
is
supposed
to
be
rolling
idly
in
the
very
lap
of
luxury
and
who
can
hardly
call
his
soul
his
own
why
the
man
eat
a
without
there
being
a
paragraph
in
the
papers
headed
of
the
prince
of
wales
his
life
is
made
an
infinite
bore
to
him
i
positive
güldmar
looked
thoughtful
i
know
little
about
kings
or
princes
he
said
but
it
seems
to
me
from
what
i
know
that
they
have
but
small
power
they
are
mere
puppets
in
olden
times
they
possessed
supremacy
but
now
i
will
tell
you
interrupted
duprèz
excitedly
who
it
is
that
rules
the
people
in
these
times
it
is
the
la
a
little
black
sharp
scratching
devil
she
is
empress
of
all
nations
no
crown
but
a
point
no
royal
robe
save
ink
it
is
certain
that
as
long
as
la
gambols
freely
over
her
realms
of
paper
so
long
must
kings
and
autocrats
shake
in
their
shoes
and
be
uncertain
of
their
thrones
mon
dieu
if
i
had
but
the
gift
of
writing
i
would
conquer
the
world
there
are
an
immense
number
of
people
writing
just
now
pierre
remarked
lorimer
with
a
smile
yet
they
do
do
much
in
the
conquering
line
because
they
are
afraid
said
duprèz
because
they
have
not
the
courage
of
their
opinions
because
they
dare
not
tell
the
truth
upon
my
life
i
believe
you
are
right
said
errington
if
there
were
a
man
bold
enough
to
declare
truths
and
denounce
lies
i
should
imagine
it
quite
possible
that
he
might
conquer
the
world
or
at
any
rate
make
it
afraid
of
him
but
is
the
world
so
full
of
lies
asked
thelma
timidly
lorimer
looked
at
her
gravely
i
fear
so
miss
güldmar
i
think
it
has
a
tolerable
harvest
of
them
every
year
a
harvest
too
that
never
fails
but
i
say
phil
look
at
the
sun
shining
let
us
go
up
on
deck
we
shall
soon
be
getting
back
to
the
altenfjord
they
all
rose
threw
on
their
caps
and
left
the
saloon
with
the
exception
of
errington
who
lingered
behind
watching
his
opportunity
and
as
thelma
followed
her
father
he
called
her
back
softly
thelma
she
hesitated
and
then
turned
towards
him
her
father
saw
her
movement
smiled
at
her
and
nodded
kindly
as
he
passed
through
the
saloon
doors
and
disappeared
with
a
beating
heart
she
sprang
quickly
to
her
lover
side
and
as
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
she
whispered
you
have
told
him
your
father
yes
my
darling
murmured
philip
as
he
kissed
her
sweet
upturned
lips
be
quite
happy
he
knows
everything
come
thelma
tell
me
again
you
love
me
i
have
not
heard
you
say
it
properly
yet
she
smiled
dreamily
as
she
leaned
against
his
breast
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
i
can
not
say
it
properly
she
said
there
is
no
language
for
my
heart
if
i
could
tell
you
all
i
feel
you
would
think
it
foolish
i
am
sure
because
it
is
all
so
wild
and
strange
she
stopped
and
her
face
grew
pale
oh
she
murmured
with
a
slight
tremor
it
is
terrible
what
is
terrible
my
sweet
one
asked
errington
drawing
her
more
closely
and
folding
her
more
tightly
in
his
arms
she
sighed
deeply
to
have
no
more
life
of
my
own
she
answered
while
her
low
voice
quivered
with
intense
feeling
it
has
all
gone
to
you
and
yours
has
come
to
me
is
it
not
strange
and
almost
sad
how
your
heart
beats
poor
boy
i
can
hear
it
throb
throb
so
fast
here
where
i
am
resting
my
head
she
looked
up
and
her
little
white
hand
caressed
his
cheek
philip
she
said
very
softly
what
are
you
thinking
about
your
eyes
shine
so
brightly
do
you
know
you
have
beautiful
eyes
have
i
he
murmured
abstractedly
looking
down
on
that
exquisite
innocent
glowing
face
and
trembling
with
the
force
of
the
restrained
passion
that
kindled
through
him
i
do
know
about
that
yours
seem
to
me
like
two
stars
fallen
from
heaven
oh
thelma
my
darling
god
make
me
worthy
of
you
he
spoke
with
intense
fervor
kissing
her
with
a
tenderness
in
which
there
was
something
of
reverence
as
well
as
fear
the
whole
soul
of
the
man
was
startled
and
roused
to
inexpressible
devotion
by
the
absolute
simplicity
and
purity
of
her
nature
the
direct
frankness
with
which
she
had
said
her
life
was
his
his
and
in
what
way
was
he
fitted
to
be
the
guardian
and
possessor
of
this
white
lily
from
the
garden
of
god
she
was
so
utterly
different
to
all
women
as
he
had
known
them
as
different
as
a
bird
of
paradise
to
a
common
meanwhile
as
these
thoughts
flitted
through
his
brain
she
moved
gently
from
his
embrace
and
smiled
proudly
yet
sweetly
worthy
of
me
she
said
softly
and
wonderingly
it
is
i
that
will
pray
to
be
made
worthy
of
you
must
not
put
it
wrongly
philip
he
made
no
answer
but
looked
at
her
as
she
stood
before
him
majestic
as
a
young
empress
in
her
straight
unadorned
white
gown
thelma
he
said
suddenly
do
you
know
how
lovely
you
are
yes
she
answered
simply
i
know
it
because
i
am
like
my
mother
but
it
is
not
anything
to
be
beautiful
unless
one
is
loved
and
then
it
is
different
i
feel
much
more
beautiful
now
since
you
think
me
pleasant
to
look
at
philip
laughed
and
caught
her
hand
what
a
child
you
are
he
said
now
let
me
see
this
little
finger
and
he
loosened
from
his
a
ring
of
brilliants
this
belonged
to
mother
thelma
he
continued
gently
and
since
her
death
i
have
always
carried
it
about
with
me
i
resolved
never
to
part
with
it
except
to
he
paused
and
slipped
it
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
where
it
sparkled
bravely
she
gazed
at
it
in
surprise
you
part
with
it
now
she
asked
with
wonder
in
her
accents
i
do
not
understand
he
kissed
her
no
i
will
explain
again
thelma
and
you
shall
not
laugh
at
me
as
you
did
the
very
first
time
i
saw
you
i
resolved
never
to
part
with
this
ring
i
say
except
to
my
promised
wife
do
you
understand
she
blushed
deeply
and
her
eyes
dropped
before
his
ardent
gaze
i
do
thank
you
very
much
philip
she
faltered
timidly
she
was
about
to
say
something
further
when
suddenly
lorimer
entered
the
saloon
he
glanced
from
errington
to
thelma
and
from
thelma
back
again
to
errington
and
smiled
so
have
certain
brave
soldiers
been
known
to
smile
in
face
of
a
he
advanced
with
his
usual
languid
step
and
nonchalant
air
and
removing
his
cap
bowed
gravely
and
courteously
let
me
be
the
first
to
offer
my
congratulations
to
the
future
lady
errington
phil
old
man
i
wish
you
joy
chapter
xv
why
sir
in
the
universal
game
of
shall
not
the
cleverest
tricksters
play
each
other
false
by
haphazard
and
so
betray
their
closest
secrets
to
their
own
and
their
infinite
amazement
congreve
when
olaf
güldmar
and
his
daughter
left
the
yacht
that
evening
errington
accompanied
them
in
order
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
escorting
his
beautiful
betrothed
as
far
as
her
own
door
they
were
all
three
very
silent
the
was
pensive
thelma
shy
and
errington
himself
was
too
happy
for
speech
arriving
at
the
farmhouse
they
saw
sigurd
curled
up
under
the
porch
playing
idly
with
the
trailing
but
on
hearing
their
footsteps
he
looked
up
uttered
a
wild
exclamation
and
fled
güldmar
tapped
his
own
forehead
significantly
he
grows
worse
and
worse
the
poor
lad
he
said
somewhat
sorrowfully
and
yet
there
is
a
strange
mingling
of
foresight
and
wit
with
his
wild
fancies
wouldst
thou
believe
it
thelma
child
and
here
he
turned
to
his
daughter
and
encircled
her
waist
with
his
arm
he
seemed
to
know
how
matters
were
with
thee
and
philip
when
i
was
yet
in
the
dark
concerning
them
this
was
the
first
allusion
her
father
had
made
to
her
engagement
and
her
head
drooped
with
a
sort
of
sweet
shame
nay
now
why
hide
thy
face
went
on
the
old
man
cheerily
didst
thou
think
i
would
grudge
my
bird
her
not
i
and
little
did
i
hope
for
thee
my
darling
that
thou
wouldst
find
a
shelter
worthy
of
thee
in
this
wild
world
he
paused
a
moment
looking
tenderly
down
upon
her
as
she
nestled
in
mute
affection
against
his
breast
then
addressing
himself
to
errington
he
went
on
we
have
a
story
in
our
norse
religion
my
lad
of
two
lovers
who
declared
their
passion
to
each
other
on
one
stormy
night
in
the
depth
of
winter
they
were
together
in
a
desolate
hut
on
the
mountains
and
around
them
lay
unbroken
tracts
of
frozen
snow
they
were
descended
from
the
gods
and
therefore
the
gods
protected
them
and
it
happened
that
after
they
had
sworn
their
troth
the
doors
of
the
hut
flew
suddenly
open
and
lo
the
landscape
had
changed
the
hills
were
gay
with
grass
and
flowers
the
sky
was
blue
and
brilliant
the
birds
sang
and
everywhere
was
heard
the
ripple
of
waters
let
loose
from
their
icy
fetters
and
gamboling
down
the
rocks
in
the
joyous
sun
this
was
the
work
of
the
goddess
friga
the
first
kiss
exchanged
by
the
lovers
she
watched
over
banished
winter
from
the
land
and
spring
came
instead
is
a
pretty
story
and
true
all
the
world
over
true
for
all
men
and
women
of
all
creeds
it
must
be
an
heart
indeed
that
will
not
warm
to
the
touch
of
love
and
mine
though
aged
grows
young
again
in
the
joy
of
my
children
he
put
his
daughter
gently
from
him
philip
saying
with
more
gravity
go
to
him
child
go
with
thy
old
father
blessing
and
take
with
thee
the
three
best
virtues
of
a
wife
truth
humility
and
obedience
good
night
my
son
and
he
wrung
errington
hand
with
fervor
you
take
longer
to
say
good
night
to
thelma
and
he
laughed
so
i
go
in
and
leave
you
to
it
and
with
a
nod
he
entered
the
house
whistling
a
tune
as
he
went
that
they
might
not
think
he
imagined
himself
lonely
or
neglected
and
the
two
lovers
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
together
exchanging
those
first
confidences
which
to
outsiders
seem
so
eminently
foolish
but
which
to
those
immediately
concerned
are
most
wonderful
delightful
strange
and
enchanting
beyond
all
description
where
from
a
practical
point
of
view
is
the
sense
of
such
questions
as
these
when
did
you
love
me
first
what
did
you
feel
when
i
said
have
you
dreamt
of
me
often
will
you
love
me
always
always
always
and
so
on
ridiculous
rubbish
exclaims
the
but
secretly
savage
old
maid
and
the
selfishly
but
privately
fidgety
and
lonely
old
bachelor
ah
but
there
are
those
who
could
tell
you
that
at
one
time
or
another
of
their
lives
this
ridiculous
rubbish
seemed
far
more
important
than
the
decline
and
fall
of
empires
more
necessary
to
existence
than
light
and
air
more
fraught
with
hope
fear
suspense
comfort
despair
and
anxiety
than
anything
that
could
be
invented
or
imagined
philip
and
thelma
man
and
woman
in
the
full
flush
of
youth
health
beauty
and
happiness
had
just
entered
their
paradise
their
and
every
little
flower
and
leaf
on
the
way
had
special
sweet
interest
for
them
love
indefinable
glories
love
proud
possibilities
love
long
ecstasies
these
like
so
many
seemed
to
smile
and
beckon
them
on
on
on
through
golden
seas
of
sunlight
through
fields
of
drowsy
entrancement
through
winding
ways
of
and
leafage
on
on
with
eyes
and
hearts
absorbed
in
one
another
unseeing
any
end
to
the
dreamlike
wonders
that
like
some
heavenly
unrolled
slowly
and
radiantly
before
them
and
so
they
murmured
those
unwise
tender
things
which
no
wisdom
in
the
world
has
ever
surpassed
and
when
philip
at
last
said
good
night
with
more
reluctance
than
romeo
and
pressed
his
parting
kiss
on
his
love
sweet
fresh
mouth
the
riddle
with
which
he
had
puzzled
himself
so
often
was
resolved
at
last
life
worth
living
worth
cherishing
worth
ennobling
the
reason
of
all
things
seemed
clear
to
him
love
and
love
only
supported
controlled
and
grandly
completed
the
universe
he
accepted
this
answer
to
all
perplexities
his
heart
expanded
with
a
sense
of
large
content
his
soul
was
satisfied
meanwhile
during
his
friend
absence
from
the
yacht
lorimer
took
it
upon
himself
to
break
the
news
to
duprèz
and
macfarlane
these
latter
young
gentlemen
had
had
their
suspicions
already
but
they
were
not
quite
prepared
to
hear
them
so
soon
confirmed
lorimer
told
the
matter
in
his
own
way
i
say
you
fellows
he
remarked
carelessly
as
he
sat
smoking
in
their
company
on
deck
you
better
look
out
if
you
stare
at
miss
güldmar
too
much
you
have
phil
down
upon
you
ha
ha
exclaimed
duprèz
slyly
the
dear
is
in
love
something
more
than
that
said
lorimer
looking
absently
at
the
cigarette
he
held
between
his
fingers
he
an
engaged
man
engaged
cried
macfarlane
excitedly
ma
certes
he
has
the
own
luck
he
just
secured
for
himself
the
grandest
woman
in
the
warld
le
crois
bien
said
duprèz
gravely
nodding
his
head
several
times
is
a
wise
boy
he
is
the
fortunate
one
i
am
not
for
marriage
at
all
no
not
for
myself
it
is
to
tie
one
hands
to
become
a
prisoner
and
that
would
not
suit
me
but
if
i
were
inclined
to
captivity
i
should
like
mademoiselle
güldmar
for
my
beautiful
gaoler
and
beautiful
she
is
dieu
beyond
all
comparison
lorimer
was
silent
so
was
macfarlane
after
a
pause
duprèz
spoke
again
and
do
you
know
lorimer
when
our
will
marry
i
have
the
slightest
idea
returned
lorimer
i
know
he
engaged
that
all
suddenly
macfarlane
broke
into
a
chuckling
laugh
i
say
lorimer
he
said
with
his
small
grey
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
be
grand
fun
to
see
auld
dyceworthy
face
when
he
hears
by
the
lord
he
fall
to
cursin
an
swearin
like
ma
pious
aunt
in
glasgie
or
that
auld
witch
that
cursed
miss
thelma
yestreen
an
eminently
unpleasant
old
woman
was
said
lorimer
musingly
i
wonder
what
she
meant
by
it
she
meant
said
duprèz
airily
that
she
knew
herself
to
be
ugly
and
venerable
while
mademoiselle
was
youthful
and
ravishing
it
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
excite
profanity
in
the
mind
of
a
lady
here
comes
errington
said
macfarlane
pointing
to
the
approaching
boat
that
was
coming
swiftly
back
from
the
güldmars
pier
lorimer
are
we
to
congratulate
him
if
you
like
returned
lorimer
i
dare
say
he
wo
object
so
that
as
soon
as
sir
philip
set
foot
on
the
yacht
his
hands
were
cordially
grasped
and
his
friends
each
other
in
good
wishes
for
his
happiness
he
thanked
them
simply
and
with
a
manly
straightforwardness
entirely
free
from
the
usual
affected
embarrassment
that
some
modern
young
men
think
it
seemly
to
adopt
under
similar
circumstances
the
fact
is
he
said
frankly
i
congratulate
myself
i
more
lucky
than
i
deserve
i
know
what
a
sensation
she
will
make
in
london
phil
said
lorimer
suddenly
i
just
thought
of
it
good
heavens
lady
winsleigh
will
cry
for
sheer
spite
and
vexation
philip
laughed
i
hope
not
he
said
i
should
think
it
would
need
immense
force
to
draw
a
tear
from
her
ladyship
cold
bright
eyes
she
used
to
like
you
awfully
phil
said
lorimer
you
were
a
great
favorite
of
hers
all
men
are
her
favorites
with
the
exception
of
one
her
husband
observed
errington
gaily
come
along
let
have
some
champagne
to
celebrate
the
day
we
propose
toasts
and
drink
healths
we
got
a
fair
excuse
for
jollity
this
evening
they
all
descended
into
the
saloon
and
had
a
merry
time
of
it
singing
songs
and
telling
good
stories
lorimer
being
the
gayest
of
the
party
and
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
they
retired
to
their
cabins
without
even
looking
at
the
wonders
of
perhaps
the
most
gorgeous
sky
that
had
yet
shone
on
their
travels
a
sky
of
complete
varying
from
the
deepest
shade
up
to
the
palest
in
which
the
sun
glowed
with
a
subdued
radiance
like
an
enormous
burning
ruby
thelma
saw
it
standing
under
her
where
her
father
had
joined
her
sigurd
saw
it
he
had
come
out
from
some
thicket
where
he
had
been
hiding
and
he
now
sat
in
a
humble
crouching
posture
at
thelma
feet
all
three
were
silent
reverently
watching
the
spreading
splendor
of
the
heavens
once
güldmar
addressed
his
daughter
in
a
soft
tone
thou
are
happy
my
bird
she
smiled
the
expression
of
her
face
was
almost
divine
in
its
rapture
perfectly
happy
my
father
at
the
sound
of
her
dulcet
voice
sigurd
looked
up
his
large
blue
eyes
were
full
of
tears
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
in
his
meagre
and
wasted
one
mistress
he
said
suddenly
do
you
think
i
shall
soon
die
she
turned
her
pitying
eyes
down
upon
him
startled
by
the
vibrating
melancholy
of
his
tone
thou
wilt
die
sigurd
answered
güldmar
gently
when
the
gods
please
not
one
second
sooner
or
later
art
thou
eager
to
see
valhalla
sigurd
nodded
dreamily
they
will
understand
me
there
he
murmured
and
i
shall
grow
straight
and
strong
and
brave
mistress
if
you
meet
me
in
valhalla
you
will
love
me
she
stroked
his
wild
fair
locks
i
love
you
now
sigurd
she
said
tenderly
but
perhaps
we
shall
all
love
each
other
better
in
heaven
yes
yes
exclaimed
sigurd
patting
her
hand
caressingly
when
we
are
all
dead
dead
when
our
bodies
crumble
away
and
turn
to
flowers
and
birds
and
butterflies
and
our
souls
come
out
like
white
and
red
flames
yes
then
we
shall
love
each
other
and
talk
of
such
strange
strange
things
he
paused
and
laughed
wildly
then
his
voice
sank
again
into
melancholy
monotony
and
he
added
mistress
you
are
killing
poor
sigurd
thelma
face
grow
very
earnest
and
anxious
are
you
vexed
with
me
dear
she
asked
soothingly
tell
me
what
it
is
that
troubles
you
sigurd
met
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
speechless
despair
and
shook
his
head
i
can
not
tell
you
he
muttered
all
my
thoughts
have
gone
to
drown
themselves
one
by
one
in
the
cold
sea
my
heart
was
buried
yesterday
and
i
saw
it
sealed
down
into
its
coffin
there
is
something
of
me
left
something
that
dances
before
me
like
a
flame
but
it
will
not
rest
it
does
not
obey
me
i
call
it
but
it
will
not
come
and
i
am
getting
tired
mistress
very
very
tired
his
voice
broke
and
a
low
sob
escaped
him
he
hid
his
face
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
güldmar
looked
at
the
poor
fellow
compassionately
the
wits
wander
further
and
further
away
he
said
to
his
daughter
in
a
low
tone
is
a
mind
like
a
broken
rainbow
split
through
by
storm
soon
vanish
be
patient
with
him
child
it
can
not
be
for
long
no
not
for
long
cried
sigurd
raising
his
head
brightly
that
is
true
not
for
long
mistress
will
you
come
with
me
and
gather
flowers
you
used
to
love
to
wander
with
your
poor
boy
in
the
fields
but
you
have
forgotten
and
i
can
not
find
any
blossoms
without
you
they
will
not
show
themselves
unless
you
come
will
you
dear
beautiful
mistress
will
you
come
she
smiled
pleased
to
see
him
a
little
more
cheerful
yes
sigurd
she
said
i
will
come
we
will
go
together
early
morning
and
gather
all
the
flowers
we
can
find
will
that
make
you
happy
yes
he
said
softly
kissing
the
hem
of
her
dress
it
will
make
me
happy
for
the
last
time
then
he
rose
in
an
attitude
of
attention
as
though
he
had
been
called
by
some
one
at
a
distance
and
with
a
grave
preoccupied
air
he
moved
away
walking
on
as
though
he
feared
to
interrupt
the
sound
of
some
soft
invisible
music
güldmar
sighed
as
he
watched
him
disappear
may
the
gods
make
us
thankful
for
a
clear
brain
when
we
have
it
he
said
devoutly
and
then
turning
to
his
daughter
he
bade
her
good
night
and
laid
his
hands
on
her
golden
head
in
silent
but
fervent
blessing
child
he
said
tremulously
in
the
new
joys
that
await
thee
never
forget
how
thy
old
father
loves
thee
then
not
trusting
himself
to
say
more
he
strode
into
the
house
and
betook
himself
to
slumber
thelma
followed
his
example
and
the
old
farmhouse
was
soon
wrapped
in
the
peace
and
stillness
of
the
strange
night
a
night
of
glittering
sunshine
sigurd
alone
was
wakeful
he
lay
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
tallest
and
stared
persistently
at
the
radiant
sky
through
the
network
of
dark
branches
now
and
then
he
smiled
as
though
he
saw
some
beatific
vision
sometimes
he
plucked
fitfully
at
the
soft
long
moss
on
which
he
had
made
his
couch
and
sometimes
he
broke
into
a
low
crooning
song
god
alone
knew
the
broken
ideas
the
dim
fancies
the
half
born
desires
that
glimmered
like
pale
ghosts
in
the
desert
of
his
brain
god
alone
in
the
great
hereafter
could
solve
the
problem
of
his
sorrows
and
throw
light
on
his
darkness
it
was
past
six
in
the
morning
when
he
arose
and
smoothing
back
his
tangled
locks
went
to
thelma
window
and
sat
down
beneath
it
in
mute
expectancy
he
had
not
long
to
wait
at
the
expiration
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
the
little
lattice
was
thrown
wide
open
and
the
face
fresh
as
a
rose
framed
in
a
shower
of
amber
locks
smiled
down
upon
him
i
am
coming
sigurd
she
cried
softly
and
joyously
how
lovely
the
morning
is
stay
for
me
there
i
shall
not
be
long
and
she
disappeared
leaving
her
window
open
sigurd
heard
her
singing
little
scraps
of
song
to
herself
as
she
moved
about
in
the
interior
of
her
room
he
listened
as
though
his
soul
were
drawn
out
of
him
by
her
voice
but
presently
the
rich
notes
ceased
and
there
was
a
sudden
silence
sigurd
knew
or
guessed
the
reason
of
that
hush
thelma
was
at
her
prayers
instinctively
the
poor
forlorn
lad
folded
his
wasted
hands
most
piteously
and
most
imploringly
he
raised
his
bewildered
eyes
to
the
blue
and
golden
glory
of
the
sky
his
conception
of
god
was
indefinable
his
dreams
of
heaven
chaotic
minglings
of
with
valhalla
but
he
somehow
felt
that
wherever
thelma
holy
aspirations
turned
there
the
angels
must
be
listening
presently
she
came
out
of
the
house
looking
radiant
as
the
morning
itself
her
luxuriant
hair
was
thrown
back
over
her
shoulders
and
fell
loosely
about
her
in
thick
curls
simply
confined
by
a
knot
of
blue
ribbon
she
carried
a
large
osier
basket
capacious
and
gracefully
shaped
now
sigurd
she
called
sweetly
i
am
ready
where
shall
we
go
sigurd
hastened
to
her
side
happy
and
smiling
across
there
he
said
pointing
toward
the
direction
of
bosekop
there
is
a
stream
under
the
trees
that
laughs
to
itself
all
day
you
know
it
mistress
and
the
poppies
are
in
the
field
as
you
go
and
by
the
banks
there
are
the
flowers
we
can
not
have
too
many
of
shall
we
go
wherever
you
like
dear
answered
thelma
tenderly
looking
down
from
her
stately
height
on
the
poor
stunted
creature
at
her
side
who
held
her
dress
as
though
he
were
a
child
clinging
to
her
as
his
sole
means
of
guidance
all
the
land
is
pleasant
they
left
the
farm
and
its
boundaries
a
few
men
were
at
work
on
one
of
güldmar
fields
and
these
looked
up
half
in
awe
half
in
fear
as
thelma
and
her
fantastic
servitor
passed
along
is
a
fine
wench
said
one
man
resting
on
his
spade
and
following
with
his
eyes
the
erect
graceful
figure
of
his
employer
daughter
maybe
maybe
said
another
gruffly
but
a
fine
wench
is
a
snare
of
the
devil
do
ye
mind
what
lovisa
elsland
told
us
ay
ay
answered
the
first
speaker
lovisa
knows
lovisa
is
the
wisest
woman
we
have
in
these
parts
that
true
the
girl
a
witch
for
sure
and
they
resumed
their
work
in
gloomy
silence
not
one
of
them
would
have
willingly
labored
on
olaf
güldmar
land
had
not
the
wages
he
offered
been
above
the
usual
rate
of
hire
and
times
were
bad
in
norway
but
otherwise
the
superstitious
fear
of
him
was
so
great
that
his
fields
might
have
gone
untilled
and
his
crops
ungathered
however
as
matters
stood
none
of
them
could
deny
that
he
was
a
good
paymaster
and
just
in
his
dealings
with
those
whom
he
employed
thelma
and
sigurd
took
their
way
in
silence
across
a
perfumed
stretch
of
the
one
naturally
fertile
spot
in
that
somewhat
barren
district
plenty
of
flowers
blossomed
at
their
feet
but
they
did
not
pause
to
gather
these
for
sigurd
was
anxious
to
get
to
the
stream
where
the
purple
pansies
grew
they
soon
reached
it
it
was
a
silvery
clear
ribbon
of
water
that
unrolled
itself
in
bright
folds
through
green
transparent
tunnels
of
fern
and
waving
grass
leaping
now
and
then
with
a
swift
dash
over
a
smooth
block
of
stone
or
jagged
rock
but
for
the
most
part
gliding
softly
with
a
happy
murmur
as
though
it
were
some
drowsy
spirit
dreaming
joyous
dreams
here
nodded
the
grave
pansies
legendary
consolers
of
the
heart
their
little
quaint
expressive
physiognomies
turned
in
every
direction
up
to
the
sky
as
though
absorbing
the
sunlight
down
to
the
ground
with
an
almost
severe
air
of
meditation
or
curled
sideways
on
their
stems
in
a
sort
of
sly
reflectiveness
sigurd
was
among
them
at
once
they
were
his
friends
his
playmates
his
favorites
and
he
gathered
them
quickly
yet
tenderly
murmuring
as
he
did
so
yes
you
must
all
die
but
death
does
not
hurt
no
life
hurts
but
not
death
see
as
i
pluck
you
you
all
grow
wings
and
fly
away
away
to
other
meadows
and
bloom
again
he
paused
and
a
puzzled
look
came
into
his
eyes
he
turned
toward
thelma
who
had
seated
herself
on
a
little
knoll
just
above
the
stream
tell
me
mistress
he
said
do
the
flowers
go
to
heaven
she
smiled
i
think
so
dear
sigurd
she
said
i
hope
so
i
am
almost
sure
they
do
sigurd
nodded
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
that
is
right
he
observed
it
would
never
do
to
leave
them
behind
you
know
they
would
be
missed
and
we
should
have
to
come
down
again
and
fetch
them
a
crackling
among
the
branches
of
some
trees
startled
him
he
looked
round
and
uttered
a
peculiar
cry
like
the
cry
of
a
wild
animal
and
exclaimed
spies
spies
ha
ha
secret
wicked
faces
that
are
afraid
to
show
themselves
come
out
mistress
mistress
make
them
come
out
thelma
rose
surprised
as
his
gesticulations
and
came
towards
him
to
her
utter
astonishment
she
found
herself
confronted
by
old
lovisa
elsland
and
the
reverend
dyceworthy
servant
ulrika
on
both
women
faces
there
was
a
curious
expression
of
mingled
fear
triumph
and
malevolence
lovisa
was
the
first
to
break
silence
at
last
she
croaked
in
a
sort
of
slow
monotonous
tone
at
last
thelma
güldmar
the
lord
has
delivered
you
into
my
hands
thelma
drew
sigurd
close
to
her
and
slipped
one
arm
around
him
poor
soul
she
said
softly
with
sweet
pitying
eyes
fixed
fearlessly
on
the
old
hag
withered
evil
visage
you
must
be
tired
wandering
about
on
the
hills
as
you
do
if
you
are
her
friend
she
added
addressing
ulrika
why
do
you
not
make
her
rest
at
home
and
keep
warm
she
is
so
old
and
feeble
feeble
shrieked
lovisa
feeble
and
she
seemed
choking
with
passion
if
i
had
my
fingers
at
your
throat
you
should
then
see
if
i
am
feeble
i
ulrika
pulled
her
by
the
arm
and
whispered
something
which
had
the
effect
of
calming
her
a
little
well
she
said
you
speak
then
i
can
wait
ulrika
cleared
her
husky
voice
and
fixed
her
dull
eyes
on
the
radiant
countenance
you
must
go
away
she
said
coldly
and
briefly
you
and
your
father
and
this
creature
and
she
pointed
contemptuously
to
the
staring
sigurd
do
you
understand
you
must
leave
the
alten
fjord
the
people
are
tired
of
you
tired
of
bad
harvests
sickness
and
continued
poverty
you
are
the
cause
of
all
our
miseries
and
we
have
resolved
you
shall
not
stay
among
us
go
quickly
take
the
blight
and
pestilence
of
your
presence
elsewhere
go
or
if
you
will
not
we
shall
burn
burn
burn
and
utterly
destroy
interrupted
lovisa
with
a
sort
of
eldritch
shriek
the
strong
pine
rafters
of
olaf
güldmar
dwelling
shall
be
kindled
into
flame
to
light
the
hills
with
crimson
far
and
near
not
a
plank
shall
be
spared
not
a
vestige
of
his
pride
be
left
stop
said
thelma
quietly
what
do
you
mean
you
must
both
be
very
mad
or
very
wicked
you
want
us
to
go
away
you
threaten
to
set
fire
to
our
home
why
we
have
done
you
no
harm
tell
me
poor
soul
and
she
turned
with
queenly
forbearance
to
lovisa
is
it
for
britta
sake
that
you
would
burn
the
house
she
lives
in
that
is
not
wise
you
cursed
me
the
other
day
and
why
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
hate
me
the
old
woman
regarded
her
with
steadfast
cruel
eyes
you
are
your
mother
child
she
said
i
hated
her
i
hate
you
you
are
a
witch
the
village
knows
it
dyceworthy
knows
it
dyceworthy
says
we
shall
be
justified
in
the
lord
sight
for
wreaking
evil
upon
you
evil
evil
be
on
those
of
evil
deeds
then
shall
the
evil
fall
on
dyceworthy
said
the
girl
calmly
he
is
wicked
in
himself
and
doubly
wicked
to
encourage
in
wickedness
he
is
ignorant
and
false
why
do
you
believe
in
such
a
man
he
is
a
saint
a
saint
cried
lovisa
wildly
and
shall
the
daughter
of
satan
withstand
his
power
and
she
clapped
her
hands
in
a
sort
of
fierce
ecstasy
thelma
glanced
at
her
pityingly
and
smiled
a
saint
poor
thing
how
little
you
know
him
she
said
and
it
is
a
pity
you
should
hate
me
for
i
have
done
you
no
wrong
i
would
do
good
to
all
if
i
knew
how
tell
me
can
i
comfort
you
or
make
your
life
more
cheerful
it
must
be
hard
to
be
so
old
and
all
alone
your
death
would
comfort
me
returned
lovisa
grimly
why
do
you
keep
britta
from
me
i
do
not
keep
her
thelma
answered
she
stays
with
me
because
she
is
happy
why
do
you
grudge
her
her
happiness
and
as
for
burning
my
father
house
surely
you
would
not
do
so
wicked
and
foolish
a
thing
but
still
you
must
do
as
you
choose
for
it
is
not
possible
that
we
shall
leave
the
altenfjord
to
please
you
here
ulrika
started
forward
angrily
you
defy
us
she
cried
you
will
not
go
and
in
her
excitement
she
seized
thelma
arm
roughly
this
action
was
too
much
for
sigurd
he
considered
it
an
attack
on
the
person
of
his
beloved
mistress
and
he
resented
it
at
once
in
his
own
fashion
throwing
himself
on
ulrika
with
sudden
ferocity
he
pushed
and
beat
her
back
as
though
he
were
a
struggling
with
refractory
prey
and
though
the
ancient
lovisa
rushed
to
the
rescue
and
thelma
imploringly
called
upon
her
zealous
champion
to
desist
all
remonstrances
were
unavailing
till
sigurd
had
reduced
his
enemy
to
the
most
abject
and
whimpering
terror
a
demon
a
demon
she
sobbed
and
moaned
as
the
valiant
dwarf
at
last
released
her
from
his
clutches
and
tossing
his
long
fair
locks
over
his
misshapen
shoulders
laughed
loudly
and
triumphantly
with
delight
at
his
victory
lovisa
lovisa
elsland
this
is
your
doing
you
brought
this
upon
me
i
may
die
now
and
you
will
not
care
o
lord
lord
have
mercy
suddenly
she
stopped
her
eyes
dilated
her
face
grew
grey
with
the
sickening
pallor
of
fear
slowly
she
raised
her
hand
and
pointed
to
sigurd
his
fantastic
dress
had
become
disordered
in
the
affray
and
his
jacket
was
torn
open
and
on
his
bare
chest
a
long
red
scar
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
was
distinctly
visible
that
scar
she
muttered
how
did
he
get
that
scar
lovisa
stared
at
her
in
impatient
derision
thelma
was
too
surprised
to
answer
immediately
and
sigurd
took
it
upon
himself
to
furnish
what
he
considered
a
crushing
reply
odin
mark
he
said
patting
the
scar
with
much
elation
no
wonder
you
are
afraid
of
it
everybody
knows
it
birds
flowers
trees
and
stars
even
you
you
are
afraid
and
he
laughed
again
and
snapped
his
fingers
in
her
face
the
woman
shuddered
violently
step
by
step
she
drew
near
to
the
wondering
thelma
and
spoke
in
low
and
trembling
accents
without
a
trace
of
her
former
anger
they
say
you
are
wicked
she
said
slowly
and
that
the
devil
has
your
soul
ready
before
you
are
dead
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
no
i
will
forgive
you
and
pray
for
you
if
you
will
tell
me
she
paused
and
then
continued
as
with
a
strong
effort
yes
tell
me
is
this
sigurd
sigurd
is
a
foundling
answered
thelma
simply
he
was
floating
about
in
the
fjord
in
a
basket
and
my
father
saved
him
he
was
quite
a
baby
he
had
this
scar
on
his
chest
then
he
has
lived
with
us
ever
since
ulrika
looked
at
her
searchingly
then
bent
her
head
whether
in
gratitude
or
despair
it
was
difficult
to
say
lovisa
elsland
she
said
monotonously
i
am
going
home
i
can
not
help
you
any
longer
i
am
tired
here
she
suddenly
broke
down
and
throwing
up
her
arms
with
a
wild
gesture
she
cried
o
god
god
o
god
and
burst
into
a
stormy
passion
of
sobs
and
tears
thelma
touched
by
her
utter
misery
would
have
offered
consolation
but
lovisa
repelled
her
with
a
fierce
gesture
go
said
the
old
woman
harshly
you
have
cast
your
spells
upon
her
i
am
witness
of
your
work
and
shall
you
escape
just
punishment
no
not
while
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
and
i
lovisa
elsland
live
to
perform
his
bidding
go
white
devil
that
you
are
go
and
carry
misfortune
upon
misfortune
to
your
fine
ah
and
she
chuckled
maliciously
as
the
girl
recoiled
from
her
her
proud
face
growing
suddenly
paler
have
i
touched
you
there
lie
in
his
breast
and
it
shall
be
as
though
a
serpent
stung
him
kiss
his
lips
and
your
touch
shall
be
poison
live
in
doubt
and
die
in
misery
go
and
may
all
evil
follow
you
she
raised
her
staff
and
waved
it
majestically
as
though
she
drew
a
circle
in
the
air
thelma
smiled
pityingly
but
deigned
no
answer
to
her
wild
ravings
come
sigurd
she
said
simply
let
us
return
home
it
is
growing
late
father
will
wonder
where
we
are
yes
yes
agreed
sigurd
seizing
the
basket
full
of
the
pansies
he
had
plucked
the
sunshine
is
slipping
away
and
we
can
not
live
with
shadows
these
are
not
real
women
mistress
they
are
dreams
black
dreams
i
have
often
fought
with
dreams
and
i
know
how
to
make
them
afraid
see
how
the
one
weeps
because
she
knows
me
and
the
other
is
just
going
to
fall
into
a
grave
i
can
hear
the
clods
thrown
on
her
head
thump
thump
it
does
not
take
long
to
bury
a
dream
come
mistress
let
us
follow
the
sunshine
and
taking
the
hand
she
extended
towards
him
he
turned
away
looking
back
once
however
to
call
out
loudly
bad
dreams
as
they
disappeared
behind
the
trees
lovisa
turned
angrily
to
the
ulrika
what
is
this
folly
she
exclaimed
striking
her
staff
fiercely
into
the
ground
art
mad
or
bewitched
ulrika
looked
up
her
plain
face
swollen
and
stained
with
weeping
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
forgive
me
she
moaned
i
did
not
know
it
how
i
know
lovisa
grew
so
impatient
that
she
seized
her
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
her
violently
know
what
she
cried
know
what
sigurd
is
my
son
said
ulrika
with
a
sort
of
solemn
resignation
then
with
a
sudden
gesture
she
threw
her
hands
above
her
head
crying
my
son
my
son
the
child
i
thought
i
had
killed
the
lord
be
praised
i
did
not
murder
him
lovisa
elsland
seemed
stupefied
with
surprise
is
this
the
truth
she
asked
at
last
slowly
and
incredulously
the
truth
the
truth
cried
ulrika
passionately
it
is
always
the
truth
that
comes
to
light
he
is
my
child
i
tell
you
i
gave
him
that
scar
she
paused
shuddering
and
continued
in
a
lower
tone
i
tried
to
kill
him
with
a
knife
but
when
the
blood
flowed
it
sickened
me
and
i
could
not
he
was
an
infant
abortion
the
evil
fruit
of
an
evil
deed
and
i
threw
him
out
to
the
waves
as
i
told
you
long
ago
you
have
had
good
use
of
my
confession
lovisa
elsland
you
have
held
me
in
your
power
by
means
of
my
secret
but
now
the
old
woman
interrupted
her
with
a
low
laugh
of
contempt
and
malice
as
the
parents
are
so
are
the
children
she
said
scornfully
your
lover
must
have
been
a
fine
man
ulrika
if
the
son
is
like
his
father
ulrika
glared
at
her
vengefully
then
drew
herself
up
with
an
air
of
defiance
i
care
nothing
for
your
taunts
lovisa
elsland
she
said
you
can
do
me
no
harm
all
is
over
between
us
i
will
help
in
no
mischief
against
the
güldmars
whatever
their
faults
they
saved
my
child
is
that
so
great
a
blessing
asked
lovisa
ironically
it
makes
your
threats
useless
answered
ulrika
you
can
not
call
me
again
coward
and
fool
shrieked
lovisa
was
it
intent
that
the
child
should
live
were
you
not
glad
to
think
it
dead
and
can
not
i
spread
the
story
of
your
infamy
through
all
the
villages
where
you
are
known
is
not
the
wretched
boy
himself
a
living
witness
of
the
attempt
you
made
to
kill
him
does
not
that
scar
speak
against
you
would
not
olaf
güldmar
relate
the
story
of
the
child
rescue
to
any
one
that
asked
him
would
you
like
all
bosekop
to
know
of
your
intrigue
with
an
escaped
criminal
who
was
afterwards
caught
and
hung
the
virtuous
ulrika
the
zealous
servant
of
the
gospel
the
pious
praying
ulrika
and
the
old
woman
trembled
with
rage
and
excitement
out
of
my
power
never
never
as
long
as
there
is
breath
in
my
body
i
will
hold
you
down
a
murderess
you
say
no
said
ulrika
very
calmly
with
a
keen
look
i
am

in
a
few
more
days
thelma
engagement
to
sir
philip
was
the
talk
of
the
neighborhood
the
news
spread
gradually
having
been
in
the
first
place
started
by
britta
whose
triumph
in
her
happiness
was
charming
to
witness
it
reached
the
astonished
and
reluctant
ears
of
the
reverend
dyceworthy
whose
rage
was
so
great
that
it
destroyed
his
appetite
for
hours
but
the
general
impression
in
the
neighborhood
where
superstition
maintained
so
strong
a
hold
on
the
primitive
and
prejudiced
minds
of
the
people
was
that
the
reckless
young
englishman
would
rue
the
day
on
which
he
wedded
the
white
witch
of
the
altenfjord
güldmar
was
regarded
with
more
suspicion
than
ever
as
having
used
some
secret
and
diabolical
influence
to
promote
the
match
and
the
whole
party
were
as
it
seemed
tabooed
and
looked
upon
as
given
up
to
the
most
unholy
practices
needless
to
say
the
opinions
of
the
villagers
had
no
effect
whatever
on
the
good
spirits
of
those
who
were
thus
unfavorably
criticised
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
merrier
group
than
that
assembled
one
fine
morning
in
front
of
güldmar
house
all
equipped
from
top
to
toe
for
some
evidently
unusually
lengthy
and
arduous
mountain
excursion
each
man
carried
a
long
stout
stick
portable
flask
knapsack
and
rug
the
latter
two
articles
strapped
together
and
slung
across
the
shoulder
and
they
all
presented
an
eminently
picturesque
appearance
particularly
sigurd
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
from
the
others
leaning
on
his
tall
staff
and
gazing
at
thelma
with
an
air
of
peculiar
pensiveness
and
abstraction
she
was
at
that
moment
busied
in
adjusting
errington
knapsack
more
comfortably
her
fair
laughing
face
turned
up
to
his
and
her
bright
eyes
alight
with
love
and
tender
solicitude
i
a
good
mind
not
to
go
at
all
he
whispered
in
her
ear
i
come
back
and
stay
with
you
all
day
you
foolish
boy
she
answered
merrily
you
would
miss
seeing
the
grand
fall
all
for
what
to
sit
with
me
and
watch
me
spinning
and
you
would
grow
so
very
sleepy
now
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
go
with
you
i
very
glad
you
not
a
man
said
errington
pressing
the
little
hand
that
had
just
buckled
his
though
i
wish
you
going
with
us
but
i
say
thelma
darling
wo
you
be
lonely
she
laughed
gaily
lonely
i
why
britta
is
with
me
besides
i
am
never
lonely
she
uttered
the
last
word
softly
with
a
shy
upward
glance
i
have
so
much
to
think
about
she
paused
and
drew
her
hand
away
from
her
lover
close
clasp
ah
she
resumed
with
a
mischievous
smile
you
are
a
conceited
boy
you
want
to
be
missed
you
wish
me
to
say
that
i
shall
feel
most
miserable
all
the
time
you
are
away
if
i
do
i
shall
not
tell
you
thelma

juncture

she
responded
meekly
and
let
britta
keep
good
guard
that
her
crazy
hag
of
a
grandam
come
not
hither
to
disturb
or
fright
thee
with
her
croaking
for

that
personage
with
a
meditative
smile
no

even
poor
sigurd

of
us

behind
suggested
lorimer
with
a
at
his
friend
oh

exclaimed
thelma
anxiously
it
would
vex
me
so
much
britta
and
i
have
often
been
alone
before
we
are
quite
safe
are
we
not
father
safe
enough
said
the
old
man
with
a
laugh
i
know
of
no
one
save
lovisa
elsland
who
has
the
courage
to
face
thee
child
still
pretty
witch
as
thou
art
not
harm
thee
to
put
the
iron
bar
across
the
house

and
to
lock
fast
the
outer
gate
when
we
have
gone
this
done
i
have
no
fear
of
thy
safety
now
and
he
kissed
his
daughter
heartily
now
lads
is
time
we
were
on
the
march
sigurd
my
boy
lead
on
wait
cried
sigurd
springing
to
thelma
side
i
must
say
and
he
caught
the
girl
hand
and
kissed
it
then
plucking
a
rose
he
left
it
between
her
fingers
that
will
remind
you
of
sigurd
mistress
think
of
him
once
once
again
when
the
midnight
glory
shines
mistress
that
is
what
the
dead
say
and
with
a
passionate
gesture
of
farewell
he
ran
and
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
little
group
that
waited
for
him
saying
exultingly
now
follow
me
sigurd
knows
the
way
sigurd
is
the
friend
of
all
the
wild
waterfall
up
the
hills
across
the
leaping
stream
through
the
sparkling
foam
and
he
began
chanting
to
himself
a
sort
of
wild
mountain
song
macfarlane
looked
at
him
dubiously
are
ye
sure
he
said
to
güldmar

the
best
guide

spite
of
his
fancies
he

njedegorze

how

asked
duprèz
eagerly
njedegorze
the
frenchman
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
give
it
up
he
said
smilingly
mademoiselle
güldmar
if
anything
happens
to
me
at
this
cascade
with
the
name
unpronounceable
you
will
again
be
my
doctor
will
you
not
thelma
laughed
as
she
shook
hands
with
him
nothing
will
happen
she
rejoined
unless
indeed
you
catch
cold
by
sleeping
in
a
hut
all
night
father
you
must
see
that
they
do
not
catch
cold
the
nodded
and
motioned
the
party
forward
sigurd
leading
the
way
errington
however
lingered
behind
on
pretense
of
having
forgotten
something
and
drawing
his
betrothed
in
his
arms
kissed
her
fondly
take
care
of
yourself
darling
he
murmured
and
then
hurrying
away
he
rejoined
his
friends
who
had
discreetly
refrained
from
looking
back
and
therefore
had
not
seen
the
lovers
embrace
sigurd
however
had
seen
it
and
the
sight
apparently
gave
fresh
impetus
to
his
movements
for
he
sprang
up
the
adjacent
hill
with
so
much
velocity
that
those
who
followed
had
some
difficulty
to
keep
up
with
him
and
it
was
not
till
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
farmhouse
that
he
resumed
anything
like
a
reasonable
pace
as
soon
as
they
had
disappeared
thelma
turned
into
the
house
and
seated
herself
at
her
britta
soon
entered
the
room
carrying
the
same
graceful
implement
of
industry
and
the
two
maidens
sat
together
for
some
time
in
a
silence
unbroken
save
by
the
low
melodious
whirring
of
the
two
wheels
and
the
mellow
complaints
of
the
strutting
doves
on
the
fröken
thelma
said
britta
at
last
timidly
yes
britta
and
her
mistress
looked
up
inquiringly
of
what
use
is
it
for
you
to
spin
now
queried
the
little
handmaid
you
will
be
a
great
lady
and
great
ladies
do
not
work
at
all
thelma
wheel
revolved
more
and
more
slowly
till
at
last
it
stopped
altogether
do
they
not
she
said
half
inquiringly
and
musingly
i
think
you
must
be
wrong
britta
it
is
impossible
that
there
should
be
people
who
are
always
idle
i
do
not
know
what
great
ladies
are
like
i
do
and
britta
nodded
her
curly
head
sagaciously
there
was
a
girl
from
hammerfest
who
went
to
christiania
to
seek
service
she
was
handy
at
her
needle
and
a
fine
spinner
and
a
great
lady
took
her
right
away
from
norway
to
london
and
the
lady
bought
her
for
a
curiosity
she
said
and
put
it
in
the
corner
of
a
large
parlor
and
used
to
show
it
to
her
friends
and
they
would
all
laugh
and
say
pretty
and
jansena
that
was
the
girl
never
span
again
she
wore
linen
that
she
got
from
the
shops
and
it
was
always
falling
into
holes
and
jansena
was
always
mending
mending
and
it
was
no
good
thelma
laughed
then
it
is
better
to
spin
after
all
britta
is
it
not
britta
looked
dubious
i
do
not
know
she
answered
but
i
am
sure
great
ladies
do
not
spin
because
as
i
said
to
you
fröken
this
jansena
mistress
was
a
great
lady
and
she
never
did
anything
no
nothing
at
all
but
she
put
on
wonderful
dresses
and
sat
in
her
room
or
was
driven
about
in
a
carriage
and
that
is
what
you
will
do
also
fröken
oh
no
britta
said
thelma
decisively
i
could
not
be
so
idle
is
it
not
fortunate
i
have
so
much
linen
ready
i
have
quite
enough
for
marriage
the
little
maid
looked
wistful
yes
dear
fröken
she
murmured
hesitatingly
but
i
was
thinking
if
it
is
right
for
you
to
wear
what
you
have
spun
because
you
see
jansena
mistress
had
wonderful
things
all
trimmed
with
lace
and
they
would
all
come
back
from
the
washing
torn
and
hanging
in
threads
and
jansena
had
to
mend
those
as
well
as
her
own
clothes
you
see
they
do
not
last
at
all
and
they
cost
a
large
sum
of
money
but
it
is
proper
for
great
ladies
to
wear
them
i
am
not
sure
of
that
britta
said
thelma
still
musingly
but
still
it
may
be
my
bridal
things
may
not
please
philip
if
you
know
anything
about
it
you
must
tell
me
what
is
right
britta
was
in
a
little
perplexity
she
had
gathered
some
idea
from
her
friend
jansena
concerning
life
in
london
she
had
even
a
misty
notion
of
what
was
meant
by
a
trousseau
with
all
its
dainty
expensive
and
often
useless
fripperies
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
explain
herself
to
her
young
mistress
whose
simple
almost
severe
tastes
would
she
instinctively
felt
recoil
from
anything
like
ostentation
in
dress
so
she
was
discreetly
silent
you
know
britta
continued
thelma
gently
i
shall
be
philip
wife
and
i
must
not
vex
him
in
any
little
thing
but
i
do
not
quite
understand
i
have
always
dressed
in
the
same
way
and
he
has
never
said
that
he
thought
me
wrongly
clothed
and
she
looked
down
with
quite
a
touching
pathos
at
her
straight
white
woolen
gown
and
smoothed
its
folds
doubtfully
the
impulsive
britta
sprang
to
her
side
and
kissed
her
with
girlish
and
unaffected
enthusiasm
my
dear
my
dear
you
are
more
lovely
and
sweet
than
anybody
in
the
world
she
cried
and
i
am
sure
sir
philip
thinks
so
too
a
beautiful
roseate
flush
suffused
thelma
cheeks
and
she
smiled
yes
i
know
he
does
she
replied
softly
and
after
all
it
does
not
matter
what
one
wears
britta
was
meditating
she
looked
lovingly
at
her
mistress
rippling
wealth
of
hair
diamonds
she
murmured
to
herself
in
a
sort
of
satisfied
soliloquy
diamonds
like
those
you
have
on
your
finger
fröken
diamonds
all
scattered
among
your
curls
like
and
white
satin
all
shining
shining
people
would
take
you
for
an
angel
thelma
laughed
merrily
britta
britta
you
are
talking
such
nonsense
nobody
dresses
so
grandly
except
queens
in
do
they
not
and
the
wise
britta
looked
more
profound
than
ever
well
we
shall
see
dear
fröken
we
shall
see
queried
thelma
with
surprised
emphasis
her
little
maid
blushed
vividly
and
looked
down
demurely
twisting
and
untwisting
the
string
of
her
apron
yes
fröken
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
have
asked
sir
philip
to
let
me
go
with
you
when
you
leave
norway
britta
thelma
astonishment
was
too
great
for
more
than
this
exclamation
oh
my
dear
do
be
angry
with
me
implored
britta
with
sparkling
eyes
rosy
cheeks
and
excited
tongue
all
pleading
eloquently
together
i
should
die
here
without
you
i
told
the
so
i
did
indeed
and
then
i
went
to
sir
philip
he
is
such
a
grand
gentleman
so
proud
and
yet
so
kind
and
i
asked
him
to
let
me
still
be
your
servant
i
said
i
knew
all
great
ladies
had
a
maid
and
if
i
was
not
clever
enough
i
could
learn
and
and
here
britta
began
to
sob
i
said
i
did
not
want
any
wages
only
to
live
in
a
little
corner
of
the
same
house
where
you
were
to
sew
for
you
and
see
you
and
hear
your
voice
sometimes
here
the
poor
little
maiden
broke
down
altogether
and
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
crying
bitterly
the
tears
were
in
thelma
eyes
too
and
she
hastened
to
put
her
arm
round
britta
waist
and
tried
to
soothe
her
by
every
loving
word
she
could
think
of
hush
britta
dear
you
must
not
cry
she
said
tenderly
what
did
philip
say
he
said
jerked
out
britta
convulsively
that
i
was
a
little
and
that
he
was
i
wanted
to
here
her
two
sparkling
wet
eyes
peeped
out
of
the
apron
inquiringly
and
seeing
nothing
but
the
sweetest
affection
on
thelma
attentive
face
she
went
on
more
steadily
he
my
cheek
and
he
laughed
and
he
said
he
would
rather
have
me
for
your
maid
than
anybody
there
and
this
last
exclamation
was
uttered
with
so
much
defiance
that
she
dashed
away
the
apron
altogether
and
stood
erect
in
glory
with
a
particularly
red
little
nose
and
very
trembling
lips
thelma
smiled
and
caressed
the
tumbled
brown
curls
i
am
very
glad
britta
she
said
earnestly
nothing
could
have
pleased
me
more
i
must
thank
philip
but
it
is
of
father
i
am
thinking
what
will
father
and
sigurd
do
oh
that
is
all
settled
fröken
said
britta
recovering
herself
rapidly
from
her
outburst
the
means
to
go
for
one
of
his
long
voyages
in
the
it
is
time
she
was
used
again
i
sure
and
sigurd
will
go
with
him
it
will
do
them
both
good
and
the
tongues
of
bosekop
can
waggle
as
much
as
they
please
none
of
us
will
be
here
to
mind
them
and
you
will
escape
your
grandmother
said
thelma
amusedly
as
she
once
more
set
her
in
motion
britta
laughed
delightedly
yes
she
will
not
find
her
way
to
england
without
some
trouble
she
exclaimed
oh
how
happy
i
shall
be
and
you
she
looked
pleadingly
at
her
mistress
you
do
not
dislike
me
for
your
servant
dislike
and
thelma
gave
her
a
glance
of
mingled
reproach
and
tenderness
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
you
britta
it
will
be
like
having
a
little
bit
of
my
old
home
always
with
me
silently
britta
kissed
her
hand
and
then
resumed
her
work
the
monotonous
murmur
of
the
two
wheels
recommenced
this
time
pleasantly
accompanied
by
the
rippling
chatter
of
the
two
girls
who
after
the
fashion
of
girls
all
the
world
over
indulged
in
many
speculations
as
to
the
new
and
strange
life
that
lay
before
them
their
ideas
were
of
the
most
primitive
character
britta
had
never
been
out
of
norway
and
thelma
experiences
apart
from
her
home
life
extended
merely
to
the
narrow
and
restricted
bounds
of
simple
and
severe
convent
discipline
where
she
had
been
taught
that
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
the
world
were
foolish
and
transient
shows
and
that
nothing
could
please
god
more
than
purity
and
rectitude
of
soul
her
character
was
formed
and
set
upon
a
firm
basis
firmer
than
she
herself
was
conscious
of
the
nuns
who
had
been
entrusted
with
her
education
had
fulfilled
their
task
with
more
than
their
customary
zeal
they
were
interested
in
the
beautiful
norwegian
child
for
the
sake
of
her
mother
who
had
also
been
their
charge
one
venerable
nun
in
particular
had
bestowed
a
deep
and
lasting
benefit
on
her
for
seeing
her
extraordinary
beauty
and
forestalling
the
dangers
and
temptations
into
which
the
possession
of
such
exceptional
charms
might
lead
her
she
adopted
a
wise
preventive
course
that
cased
her
as
it
were
in
armor
proof
against
all
the
assailments
of
flattery
she
told
the
girl
quite
plainly
that
she
was
beautiful
but
at
the
same
time
made
her
aware
that
beauty
was
common
that
she
shared
it
alike
with
birds
flowers
trees
and
all
the
wonderful
objects
of
nature
moreover
that
it
was
nothing
to
boast
of
being
so
perishable
suppose
a
rose
foolish
enough
to
boast
of
its
pretty
leaves
said
the
gentle
on
one
occasion
they
all
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
short
time
and
become
decayed
and
yellow
it
is
only
the
fragrance
or
the
of
the
rose
that
lasts
such
precepts
that
might
have
been
wasted
on
a
less
sensitive
and
thoughtful
nature
sank
deeply
into
thelma
mind
she
accepted
them
not
only
in
theory
but
in
practice
and
the
result
was
that
she
accepted
her
beauty
as
she
accepted
her
health
as
a
mere
natural
occurrence
no
more
she
was
taught
that
the
three
principal
virtues
of
a
woman
were
chastity
humility
and
obedience
these
were
the
laws
of
god
fixed
and
immutable
which
no
one
dared
break
without
committing
grievous
and
unpardonable
sin
so
she
thought
and
according
to
her
thoughts
she
lived
what
a
strange
world
then
lay
before
her
in
the
contemplated
change
that
was
about
to
take
place
in
the
even
tenor
of
her
existence
a
world
of
intrigue
and
folly
a
world
of
infidelity
and
falsehood
how
would
she
meet
it
it
was
a
question
she
never
asked
herself
she
thought
london
a
sort
of
magnified
christiania
or
at
best
the
provencal
town
of
arles
on
a
larger
scale
she
had
heard
her
father
speak
of
it
but
only
in
a
vague
way
and
she
had
been
able
to
form
no
just
idea
even
to
herself
of
the
enormous
metropolis
crowded
to
excess
with
its
glad
and
sorrowful
busy
and
idle
rich
and
poor
millions
england
itself
floated
before
her
fancy
as
a
green
fertile
embowered
island
where
shakespeare
had
lived
and
it
delighted
her
to
know
that
her
future
home
errington
manor
was
situated
in
warwickshire
shakespeare
county
of
the
society
that
awaited
her
she
had
no
notion
she
was
prepared
to
keep
house
for
her
husband
in
a
very
simple
way
to
spin
his
household
linen
to
spare
him
all
trouble
and
expense
and
to
devote
herself
body
and
soul
to
his
service
as
may
be
well
imagined
the
pictures
she
drew
of
her
future
married
life
as
she
sat
and
span
with
britta
on
that
peaceful
afternoon
were
widely
different
to
the
destined
reality
that
every
day
approached
her
more
nearly
meantime
while
the
two
girls
were
at
home
and
undisturbed
in
the
quiet
farm
house
the
mountaineering
party
headed
by
sigurd
were
well
on
their
way
towards
the
great
fall
of
njedegorze
they
had
made
a
toilsome
ascent
of
the
hills
by
the
side
of
the
alten
river
they
had
climbed
over
craggy
boulders
and
slippery
rocks
sometimes
wading
in
the
stream
or
pausing
to
rest
and
watch
the
salmon
leap
and
turn
glittering
somersaults
in
the
air
close
above
the
water
and
they
had
beguiled
their
fatigue
with
songs
and
laughter
and
the
telling
of
fantastic
legends
and
stories
in
which
sigurd
had
shone
at
his
best
indeed
this
unhappy
being
was
in
a
singularly
clear
and
rational
frame
of
mind
disposed
too
to
be
agreeable
even
towards
errington
lorimer
who
for
reasons
of
his
own
had
kept
a
close
watch
on
sigurd
ever
since
his
friend
engagement
to
thelma
was
surprised
and
gratified
at
this
change
in
his
former
behavior
and
encouraged
him
in
it
while
errington
himself
responded
to
the
dwarf
proffered
friendship
and
walked
beside
him
chatting
cheerfully
during
the
most
part
of
the
excursion
to
the
fall
it
was
a
long
and
exceedingly
difficult
journey
and
in
some
parts
dangerous
but
sigurd
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
commendations
bestowed
on
him
by
the
and
guided
them
by
the
easiest
and
most
secure
paths
till
at
last
about
seven
in
the
evening
they
heard
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
rapids
below
the
fall
and
with
half
an
hour
more
exertion
came
in
sight
of
them
though
not
as
yet
of
the
fall
itself
yet
the
rapids
were
grand
enough
to
merit
attention
and
the
whole
party
stopped
to
gaze
on
the
whirling
wonders
of
water
that
hissing
furiously
circled
round
and
round
giddily
in
wheels
of
white
foam
and
then
as
though
enraged
leaped
high
over
obstructing
stones
and
branches
and
rushed
onward
and
downward
to
the
smoother
length
of
the
river
the
noise
was
deafening
they
could
not
hear
each
other
speak
unless
by
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
even
then
the
sounds
were
rendered
almost
indistinct
by
the
riotous
uproar
sigurd
however
who
knew
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
place
sprang
lightly
on
a
jutting
crag
and
putting
both
hands
to
his
mouth
uttered
a
peculiar
shrill
and
cry
clear
above
the
turmoil
of
the
restless
waters
that
cry
was
echoed
back
eight
distinct
times
from
the
surrounding
rocks
and
hills
sigurd
laughed
triumphantly
you
see
he
exclaimed
as
he
resumed
his
leadership
of
the
party
they
all
know
me
they
are
obliged
to
answer
me
when
i
call
they
dare
not
disobey
and
his
blue
eyes
flashed
with
that
sudden
wild
fire
that
generally
foretold
some
access
of
his
particular
mania
errington
saw
this
and
said
soothingly
of
course
not
sigurd
no
one
would
dream
of
disobeying
you
see
how
we
follow
you
we
all
do
exactly
what
you
tell
us
we
are
sheep
sigurd
added
lorimer
lazily
and
you
are
the
shepherd
sigurd
looked
from
one
to
the
other
half
doubtingly
half
cunningly
he
smiled
yes
he
said
you
will
follow
me
will
you
not
up
to
the
very
top
of
the
fall
by
all
means
answered
sir
philip
gaily
anywhere
you
choose
to
go
sigurd
seemed
satisfied
and
lapsing
into
the
calm
composed
manner
which
had
distinguished
him
all
day
he
led
the
way
as
before
and
they
resumed
their
march
this
time
in
silence
for
conversation
was
impossible
the
nearer
they
came
to
the
yet
invisible
fall
the
more
thunderous
grew
the
din
it
was
as
though
they
approached
some
vast
where
opposing
armies
were
in
full
action
with
all
the
tumult
of
cannonade
and
musketry
the
ascent
grew
steeper
and
more
difficult
at
times
the
high
barriers
of
rocks
seemed
almost
impassable
often
they
were
compelled
to
climb
over
confused
heaps
of
huge
stones
through
which
the
eddying
water
pushed
its
way
with
speed
and
fury
but
sigurd
precision
was
never
at
fault
he
leaped
crag
after
crag
swiftly
and
skillfully
always
lighting
on
a
sure
foothold
and
guiding
the
others
to
do
the
same
at
last
at
a
sharp
turn
of
one
of
these
rocky
eminences
they
perceived
an
enormous
cloud
of
white
vapor
rising
up
like
smoke
from
the
earth
and
twisting
itself
as
it
rose
in
swaying
serpentine
folds
as
though
some
giant
were
shaking
it
to
and
fro
like
a
long
flowing
veil
in
the
air
sigurd
paused
and
pointed
forward
njedegorze
he
cried
they
all
pressed
on
with
some
excitement
the
ground
vibrated
beneath
their
feet
with
the
shock
of
the
falling
torrent
and
the
clash
and
uproar
of
the
disputing
waters
rolled
in
their
ears
like
the
grand
sustained
bass
of
some
huge
cathedral
organ
almost
blinded
by
the
spray
that
dashed
its
disdainful
drops
in
their
faces
deafened
by
the
majestic
loud
and
ceaseless
eloquence
that
poured
its
persuasive
force
into
the
splitting
hearts
of
the
rocks
around
them
breathless
with
climbing
and
tread
out
they
struggled
on
and
broke
into
one
unanimous
shout
of
delight
and
triumph
when
they
at
last
reached
the
small
hut
that
had
been
erected
for
the
convenience
of
travellers
who
might
choose
that
way
to
journey
to
the
altenfjord
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
magnificent
cascade
one
of
the
grandest
in
norway
what
a
sublime
spectacle
it
was
that
tempest
of
water
sweeping
sheer
down
the
towering
rocks
in
one
straight
broad
unbroken
sheet
of
foam
a
myriad
rainbows
flashed
in
the
torrent
and
vanished
to
reappear
again
instantly
with
redoubled
lustre
while
the
glory
of
the
evening
sunlight
glittering
on
one
side
of
the
fall
made
it
gleam
like
a
sparkling
shower
of
molten
gold
njedegorze
cried
sigurd
again
giving
a
singularly
musical
pronunciation
to
the
apparently
uncouth
name
come
still
a
little
further
to
the
top
of
the
fall
olaf
güldmar
however
paid
no
attention
to
this
invitation
he
was
already
beginning
to
busy
himself
with
preparations
for
passing
the
night
comfortably
in
the
hut
before
mentioned
stout
old
norseman
as
he
was
there
were
limits
to
his
endurance
and
the
arduous
exertions
of
the
long
day
had
brought
fatigue
to
him
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
the
party
macfarlane
was
particularly
exhausted
his
frequent
pulls
at
the
whiskey
flask
had
been
of
little
or
no
avail
as
a
support
to
his
aching
limbs
and
now
he
had
reached
his
destination
he
threw
himself
full
length
on
the
turf
in
front
of
the
hut
and
groaned
most
dismally
lorimer
surveyed
him
amusedly
and
stood
beside
him
the
very
picture
of
a
cool
young
briton
whom
nothing
could
possibly
discompose
done
up
eh
sandy
he
inquired
done
up
growled
macfarlane
d
think
i
a
norseman
or
a
jumping
frenchy
this
with
a
look
of
positive
indignation
at
the
lively
duprèz
who
if
tired
was
probably
too
vain
to
admit
it
for
he
was
strutting
about
giving
vent
to
his
genuine
admiration
of
the
scene
before
him
with
the
utmost
freshness
and
enthusiasm
i
just
a
plain
scotchman
an
no

he
drew
out
his
flask
and
took
another
extensive
pull
at
it
then
he
added
suddenly
just
look
at
errington
he
be
in
a
fair
way
to
break
his
neck
if
he
follows
yon
wee
crazy
loon
any
further
at
these
words
lorimer
turned
sharply
round
and
perceived
his
friend
following
sigurd
step
by
step
up
a
narrow
footing
in
the
steep
ascent
of
some
rough
irregular
crags
that
ran
out
and
formed
a
narrow
ledge
ending
in
a
sharp
point
jutting
directly
over
the
full
fury
of
the
waterfall
he
watched
the
two
climbing
figures
for
an
instant
without
any
anxiety
then
he
suddenly
remembered
that
philip
had
promised
to
go
with
sigurd
to
the
top
of
the
fall
acting
on
a
rapid
impulse
which
he
did
not
stop
to
explain
to
himself
lorimer
at
once
started
off
after
them
but
the
ascent
was
difficult
they
were
some
distance
ahead
and
though
he
shouted
vociferously
the
roar
of
the
cascade
rendered
his
voice
inaudible
gaining
on
them
however
by
slow
degrees
he
was
startled
when
all
at
once
they
disappeared
at
the
summit
and
breathless
with
his
rapid
climb
he
paused
bewildered
he
saw
sigurd
creeping
cautiously
out
along
the
rocky
shelf
that
overhung
the
tumbling
torrent
his
gaze
grew
riveted
with
a
sort
of
deadly
fascination
on
the
spot
good
god
he
muttered
under
his
breath
surely
phil
will
not
follow
him
he
watched
with
strained
eyes
and
a
smothered
cry
escaped
him
as
errington
tall
figure
erect
and
bold
appeared
on
that
narrow
and
dangerous
platform
he
never
knew
how
he
clambered
up
the
rest
of
the
slippery
ascent
a
double
energy
seemed
given
to
his
active
limbs
he
never
paused
again
for
one
second
till
he
also
stood
on
the
platform
without
being
heard
or
perceived
by
either
sigurd
or
philip
their
backs
were
turned
to
him
and
he
feared
to
move
or
speak
lest
a
sudden
surprised
movement
on
their
parts
should
have
the
fatal
result
of
precipitating
one
or
both
into
the
fall
he
remained
therefore
behind
them
silent
and
motionless
looking
as
they
looked
at
the
terrific
scene
below
from
that
point
njedegorze
was
as
a
huge
boiling
caldron
from
which
arose
twisted
wreaths
and
coiling
lengths
of
white
vapor
faintly
colored
with
gold
and
silvery
blue
dispersing
in
air
these
mists
took
all
manner
of
fantastic
forms
ghostly
arms
seemed
to
wave
and
beckon
ghostly
hands
to
unite
in
prayer
and
fluttering
creatures
in
gossamer
draperies
of
green
and
crimson
appeared
to
rise
and
float
and
retire
and
shrink
to
nothingness
again
in
the
rainbow
drift
and
sweep
of
whirling
foam
errington
gazed
unconcernedly
down
on
the
seething
abyss
he
pushed
back
his
cap
from
his
brow
and
let
the
fresh
wind
play
among
his
dark
clustering
curls
his
nerves
were
steady
and
he
surveyed
the
giddily
twisting
wheels
of
shining
water
without
any
corresponding
giddiness
in
his
own
brain
he
had
that
sincere
delight
in
a
sublime
natural
spectacle
which
is
the
heritage
of
all
who
possess
a
poetic
and
artistic
temperament
and
though
he
stood
on
a
frail
ledge
of
rock
from
which
one
false
or
unwary
step
might
send
him
to
certain
destruction
he
had
not
the
slightest
sense
of
possible
danger
in
his
position
withdrawing
his
eyes
from
the
fall
he
looked
kindly
down
at
sigurd
who
in
turn
was
staring
up
at
him
with
a
wild
fixity
of
regard
well
old
boy
he
said
cheerfully
this
is
a
fine
sight
have
you
had
enough
of
it
shall
we
go
back
sigurd
drew
imperceptibly
nearer
lorimer
from
his
point
of
vantage
behind
a
huge
bowlder
drew
nearer
also
go
back
echoed
sigurd
why
should
we
go
back
why
indeed
laughed
errington
lightly
balancing
himself
on
the
trembling
rocks
beneath
him
except
that
i
should
scarcely
think
this
is
the
best
place
on
which
to
pass
the
night
not
enough
room
and
too
much
noise
what
say
you
oh
brave
brave
fool
cried
the
dwarf
in
sudden
excitement
are
you
not
the
young
baronet
keen
eyes
glanced
him
over
with
amused
wonder
what
of
he
demanded
coolly
still
nearer
came
sigurd
nearer
also
came
the
watchful
though
almost
invisible
lorimer
look
down
there
continued
sigurd
in
shrill
tones
pointing
to
the
foaming
gulf
look
at
the
see
the
beautiful
spirits
with
the
long
pale
green
hair
and
glittering
wings
see
how
they
beckon
beckon
beckon
they
want
some
one
to
join
them
look
how
their
white
arms
wave
they
throw
back
their
golden
veils
and
smile
at
us
they
call
to
you
with
the
strong
figure
and
the
proud
eyes
why
do
you
not
go
to
them
they
will
kiss
and
caress
you
they
have
sweet
lips
and
bosoms
they
will
love
you
and
take
care
of
you
they
are
as
fair
as
thelma
are
they
i
doubt
it
and
errington
smiled
dreamily
as
he
turned
his
head
again
towards
the
fleecy
whirl
of
white
water
and
saw
at
once
with
an
artist
quick
eye
what
his
companion
meant
by
the
in
the
fantastic
twisting
gliding
shapes
tossed
up
in
the
vaporous
mist
of
the
fall
but
i
take
your
word
sigurd
without
making
the
elves
personal
acquaintance
come
along
this
place
is
bad
for
you
we
dance
with
the
nymphs
another
time
and
with
a
light
laugh
he
was
about
to
turn
away
when
he
was
surprised
by
a
sudden
strange
convulsion
of
sigurd
countenance
his
blue
eyes
flashed
with
an
almost
phosphorescent
lustre
his
pale
skin
flushed
deeply
red
and
the
veins
in
his
forehead
started
into
swelled
and
knotted
prominence
another
time
he
screamed
loudly
no
no
now
now
die
robber
of
thelma
love
die
die
repeating
these
words
like
quick
gasps
of
fury
he
twisted
his
meager
arms
tightly
round
errington
and
thrust
him
fiercely
with
all
his
might
towards
the
edge
of
the
fall
for
one
second
philip
strove
against
him
the
next
he
closed
his
eyes
thelma
face
smiled
on
his
mind
in
that
darkness
as
though
in
white
farewell
the
surging
blood
roared
in
his
ears
with
more
thunder
than
the
terrific
tumble
of
the
torrent
god
he
muttered
and
then
he
stood
safe
on
the
upper
part
of
the
rocky
platform
with
lorimer
strong
hand
holding
him
in
a
grasp
and
lorimer
face
pale
but
looking
cheerfully
into
his
for
a
moment
he
was
too
bewildered
to
speak
his
friend
loosened
him
and
laughed
rather
forcedly
a
slight
tremble
of
his
lips
was
observable
under
his
fair
moustache
by
jove
phil
he
remarked
in
his
usual
nonchalant
manner
that
was
rather
a
narrow
shave
fortunate
i
happened
to
be
there
errington
gazed
about
him
confusedly
where
sigurd
he
asked
gone
ran
off
like
a
goat
as
sandy
elegantly
describes
him
i
thought
at
first
he
meant
to
jump
over
the
fall
in
which
case
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
as
my
hands
were
full
but
he
taken
a
safe
landward
direction
did
he
try
to
push
me
over
exactly
he
was
quite
convinced
that
the
mermaids
wanted
you
but
i
considered
that
miss
thelma
wishes
had
a
prior
claim
on
my
regard
look
here
old
man
said
errington
suddenly
do
jest
about
it
you
saved
my
life
well
and
lorimer
laughed
quite
by
accident
i
assure
you
by
accident
and
philip
flushed
up
looking
very
handsome
and
earnest
i
believe
you
followed
us
up
here
thinking
something
might
happen
now
did
you
suppose
i
did
began
lorimer
but
he
was
interrupted
by
his
friend
who
seized
his
hand
and
pressed
it
with
a
warm
close
affectionate
fervor
their
eyes
met
and
lorimer
blushed
as
though
he
had
performed
some
action
meriting
blame
rather
than
gratitude
that
do
old
fellow
he
said
almost
nervously
as
we
say
in
polite
society
when
some
one
crushes
our
favorite
corn
under
his
heel
do
mention
it
you
see
sigurd
cracked
there
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
that
and
he
hardly
accountable
for
his
vagaries
then
i
know
something
about
him
that
perhaps
you
do
he
loves
your
thelma
they
were
making
the
descent
of
the
rocks
together
and
errington
stopped
short
in
surprise
loves
thelma
you
mean
as
a
brother
oh
no
i
do
i
mean
that
he
loves
her
as
brothers
often
love
other
people
sisters
his
affection
is
by
no
means
fraternal
if
it
were
only
i
see
and
philip
eyes
filled
with
a
look
of
grave
compassion
poor
fellow
i
understand
his
hatred
of
me
now
good
heavens
how
he
must
suffer
i
forgive
him
with
all
my
heart
but
i
say
thelma
has
no
idea
of
this
of
course
not
and
you
better
not
tell
her
what
the
good
of
making
her
unhappy
but
how
did
learn
it
inquired
philip
with
a
look
of
some
curiosity
at
his
friend
oh
i
and
lorimer
laughed
carelessly
i
was
always
an
observing
sort
of
fellow
fond
of
putting
two
and
two
together
and
making
four
of
them
when
i
was
too
exhausted
and
the
weather
was
too
hot
for
the
process
sigurd
rather
attached
to
me
indulges
me
with
some
specially
private
ravings
now
and
then
i
soon
found
out
his
secret
though
i
believe
the
poor
little
chap
does
understand
his
own
feelings
himself
well
said
errington
thoughtfully
under
the
circumstances
better
not
mention
this
affair
of
the
fall
to
güldmar
it
will
only
vex
him
sigurd
wo
try
such
a
prank
again
i
not
so
sure
of
that
replied
lorimer
but
you
know
enough
now
to
be
on
your
guard
with
him
he
paused
and
looked
up
with
a
misty
softness
in
his
frank
blue
eyes
then
went
on
in
a
subdued
tone
when
i
saw
you
on
the
edge
of
that
frightful
chasm
phil
he
broke
off
as
if
the
recollection
were
too
painful
and
exclaimed
suddenly
good
god
if
i
had
lost
you
errington
clapped
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
well
what
if
you
had
he
asked
almost
mirthfully
though
there
was
a
suspicious
tremble
in
his
ringing
voice
i
should
have
said
with
horatio
am
more
an
antique
roman
than
a
dane
and
gone
after
you
laughed
lorimer
and
who
knows
what
a
jolly
banquet
we
might
not
have
been
enjoying
in
the
next
world
by
this
time
if
i
believe
in
anything
at
all
i
believe
in
a
really
agreeable
heaven
nectar
and
ambrosia
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
hebes
to
wait
upon
you
as
he
spoke
they
reached
the
sheltering
hut
where
güldmar
duprèz
and
macfarlane
were
waiting
rather
impatiently
for
them
where
sigurd
cried
the
gone
for
a
ramble
on
his
own
account
answered
errington
readily
you
know
his
fancies
i
wish
his
fancies
would
leave
him
grumbled
güldmar
he
promised
to
light
a
fire
and
spread
the
meal
and
now
who
knows
whither
he
has
wandered
never
mind
sir
said
lorimer
engage
me
as
a
i
can
light
a
fire
and
can
also
sit
beside
it
when
it
is
properly
kindled
more
i
can
not
promise
as
the
housemaids
say
when
they
object
to
assist
the
cook
it
would
be
me
cook
cried
duprèz
catching
at
this
word
i
can
cook
give
me
anything
to
broil
i
will
broil
it
you
have
coffee
i
will
make
it
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
coat
turned
up
his
cuffs
and
manufactured
the
cap
of
a
out
of
a
newspaper
which
he
stuck
jauntily
on
his
head
behold
me
votre
his
liveliness
was
infectious
they
all
set
to
work
with
a
will
and
in
a
few
moments
a
crackling
blazed
cheerily
on
the
ground
and
the
gipsy
preparations
for
the
supper
went
on
apace
amid
peals
of
laughter
soon
the
fragrance
of
steaming
coffee
arose
and
mingled
itself
with
the
resinous
odors
of
the
surrounding
while
macfarlane
distinguished
himself
by
catching
a
fine
salmon
trout
in
a
quiet
nook
of
the
rushing
river
and
this
duprèz
cooked
in
a
style
that
would
have
done
honor
to
a
they
made
an
excellent
meal
and
sang
songs
in
turn
and
told
stories
olaf
güldmar
in
particular
related
eerie
legends
of
the
and
many
a
striking
history
of
ancient
origin
full
of
terror
and
superstition
concerning
witches
devils
and
spirits
both
good
and
evil
who
are
still
believed
to
have
their
abode
on
the
norwegian
hills
for
as
the
remarked
with
a
smile
when
civilization
has
driven
these
unearthly
beings
from
every
other
refuge
in
the
world
they
will
always
be
sure
of
a
welcome
in
norway
it
was
eleven
when
they
at
last
retired
within
the
hut
to
rest
for
the
night
and
the
errant
sigurd
had
not
returned
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
but
there
was
no
window
to
the
small
shed
and
light
and
air
came
only
through
the
door
which
was
left
wide
open
the
tired
travellers
lay
down
on
their
rugs
and
blankets
and
wishing
each
other
a
cheerful
good
night
were
soon
fast
asleep
errington
was
rather
restless
and
lay
awake
for
some
little
time
listening
to
the
stormy
discourse
of
the
fall
but
at
last
his
eyelids
yielded
to
the
heaviness
that
oppressed
them
and
he
sank
into
a
light
slumber
meanwhile
the
imperial
sun
rode
majestically
downwards
to
the
edge
of
the
horizon
and
the
sky
blushed
into
the
pale
tint
of
a
wild
rose
that
deepened
softly
and
steadily
with
an
fiery
brilliance
as
the
minutes
glided
noiselessly
on
to
the
enchanted
midnight
hour
a
wind
began
to
rustle
mysteriously
among
the
pines
then
gradually
growing
wrathful
strove
to
whistle
a
loud
defiance
to
the
roar
of
the
tumbling
waters
through
the
little
nooks
and
crannies
of
the
roughly
constructed
cabin
where
the
travellers
slept
it
uttered
small
wild
shrieks
of
warning
or
dismay
and
suddenly
as
though
touched
by
an
invisible
hand
sir
philip
awoke
a
crimson
glare
streaming
through
the
open
door
dazzled
his
drowsy
eyes
was
it
a
forest
on
fire
he
started
up
in
dreamy
alarm
then
remembered
where
he
was
realizing
that
there
must
be
an
exceptionally
fine
sky
to
cast
so
ruddy
a
reflection
on
the
ground
he
threw
on
his
cloak
and
went
outside
what
a
wondrous
almost
unearthly
scene
greeted
him
his
first
impulse
was
to
shout
aloud
in
sheer
ecstasy
his
next
to
stand
silent
in
reverential
awe
the
great
fall
was
no
longer
a
sweeping
flow
of
white
foam
it
had
changed
to
a
sparkling
shower
of
rubies
as
though
some
great
genie
tired
of
his
treasures
were
flinging
them
away
by
giant
handfuls
in
the
most
reckless
haste
and
lavish
abundance
from
the
bottom
of
the
cascade
a
crimson
vapor
arose
like
smoke
from
flame
and
the
whirling
rapids
deeply
red
for
the
most
part
darkened
here
and
there
into
an
flecked
with
gold
while
the
spray
tossed
high
over
interrupting
rocks
and
boulders
glittered
as
it
fell
like
small
fragments
of
broken
opal
the
sky
was
of
one
dense
uniform
from
west
to
east
soft
and
shimmering
as
a
broad
satin
pavilion
freshly
unrolled
the
sun
was
invisible
hidden
behind
the
adjacent
mountains
but
his
rays
touched
some
peaks
in
the
distance
on
which
white
wreaths
of
snow
lay
bringing
them
into
near
and
sparkling
prominence
the
whole
landscape
was
transformed
the
tall
trees
rustling
and
swaying
in
the
now
boisterous
wind
took
all
flickering
tints
of
color
on
their
trunks
and
leaves
the
grey
stones
and
pebbles
turned
to
lumps
of
gold
and
heaps
of
diamonds
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
rapids
a
large
tuft
of
heather
in
a
cleft
of
the
rocks
glowed
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
warmth
like
a
suddenly
kindled
fire
a
troop
of
witches
dancing
wildly
on
the
sward
a
ring
of
fairies
kelpies
tripping
from
crag
to
crag
a
sudden
chorus
of
nothing
unreal
or
fantastical
would
have
surprised
errington
at
that
moment
indeed
he
almost
expected
something
of
the
kind
the
scene
was
so
eminently
fitted
for
it
positively
i
must
wake
lorimer
he
thought
to
himself
he
to
miss
such
a
gorgeous
spectacle
as
this
he
moved
a
little
more
in
position
to
view
the
fall
what
was
that
small
dark
object
running
swiftly
yet
steadily
along
on
the
highest
summit
of
those
jutting
crags
he
rubbed
his
eyes
amazedly
was
it
could
it
be
he
watched
it
for
a
moment
then
uttered
a
loud
cry
as
he
saw
it
pause
on
the
very
ledge
of
rock
from
which
but
a
short
while
since
he
himself
had
been
so
nearly
precipitated
the
figure
was
now
distinctly
visible
outlined
in
black
against
the
flaming
crimson
of
the
sky
it
stood
upright
and
waved
its
arms
with
a
frantic
gesture
there
was
no
mistaking
it
it
sigurd
without
another
second
hesitation
errington
rushed
back
to
the
hut
and
awoke
with
clamorous
alarm
the
rest
of
the
party
his
brief
explanation
sufficed
they
all
hurried
forth
in
startled
excitement
sigurd
still
occupied
his
hazardous
position
and
as
they
looked
at
him
he
seemed
to
dance
wildly
nearer
the
extreme
edge
of
the
rocky
platform
old
güldmar
turned
pale
the
gods
preserve
him
he
muttered
in
his
beard
then
turning
he
began
resolutely
to
make
the
ascent
of
the
rocks
with
long
rapid
strides
the
young
men
followed
him
eager
and
almost
breathless
each
and
all
bent
upon
saving
sigurd
from
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
and
trying
by
different
ways
to
get
more
quickly
near
the
unfortunate
lad
and
call
or
draw
him
back
by
force
from
his
point
of
imminent
deadly
peril
they
were
more
than
up
when
a
piercing
cry
rang
clearly
above
the
thunderous
din
of
the
fall
a
cry
that
made
them
pause
for
a
moment
sigurd
had
caught
sight
of
the
figures
advancing
to
his
rescue
and
was
waving
them
back
with
eloquent
gesture
of
anger
and
defiance
his
small
misshapen
body
was
alive
with
wrath
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
some
dwarf
king
ruling
over
the
glittering
crimson
torrent
and
grimly
forbidding
strangers
to
enter
on
the
boundaries
of
his
magic
territory
they
however
pressed
on
with
renewed
haste
and
they
had
nearly
reached
the
summit
when
another
shrill
cry
echoed
over
the
foam
once
more
they
paused
they
were
in
full
view
of
the
distraught
sigurd
and
he
turned
his
head
towards
them
shaking
back
his
long
fair
hair
with
his
old
favorite
gesture
and
laughing
in
apparent
glee
then
he
suddenly
raised
his
arms
and
clasping
his
hands
together
poised
himself
as
though
he
were
some
winged
thing
about
to
fly
sigurd
sigurd
shouted
güldmar
his
strong
voice
tremulous
with
anguish
come
back
come
back
to
thelma
at
the
sound
of
that
beloved
name
the
unhappy
creature
seemed
to
hesitate
and
profiting
by
that
instant
of
irresolution
errington
and
lorimer
rushed
forward
too
late
sigurd
saw
them
coming
and
glided
with
stealthy
caution
to
the
very
brink
of
the
torrent
where
there
was
scarcely
any
foothold
there
he
looked
back
at
his
rescuers
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
cunning
and
broke
into
a
loud
derisive
laugh
then
still
with
clasped
hands
and
smiling
face
unheeding
the
shout
of
horror
that
broke
from
those
who
beheld
him
he
leaped
and
fell
down
down
into
the
roaring
abyss
for
one
one
lightning
flash
his
twisted
figure
like
a
slight
black
speck
was
seen
against
the
wide
roseate
glory
of
the
tumbling
cascade
then
it
disappeared
engulfed
and
lost
for
ever
gone
with
all
his
wild
poet
fancies
and
wandering
dreams
gone
with
his
unspoken
love
and
unguessed
sorrows
gone
where
dark
things
shall
be
made
light
and
where
the
broken
or
tangled
chain
of
the
soul
intelligence
shall
be
mended
and
made
perfect
by
the
tender
hands
of
the
and
the
one
whose
ways
are
too
gloriously
vast
for
our
finite
comprehension
gone
mistress
as
he
would
have
said
to
the
innocent
cause
of
his
heart
anguish
gone
where
i
shall
grow
straight
and
strong
and
brave
mistress
if
you
meet
me
in
valhalla
you
will
love
me
chapter
xvii
do
not
i
pray
you
think
evilly
of
so
holy
a
man
he
has
a
sore
combat
against
the
flesh
and
the
devil
maid
of
the
spectators
of
the
catastrophe
stood
for
a
minute
inert
and
speechless
stupefied
by
its
suddenness
and
awful
rapidity
then
with
one
accord
they
hurried
down
to
the
level
shore
of
the
torrent
moved
by
the
unanimous
idea
that
they
might
possibly
succeed
in
rescuing
sigurd
frail
corpse
from
the
sharp
teeth
of
the
jagged
rocks
that
piercing
upwards
through
the
foam
of
the
roaring
rapids
were
certain
to
bruise
tear
and
disfigure
it
beyond
all
recognition
but
even
this
small
satisfaction
was
denied
them
there
was
no
sign
of
a
floating
or
struggling
body
anywhere
visible
and
while
they
kept
an
eager
the
light
in
the
heavens
slowly
changed
from
burning
crimson
it
softened
to
a
tender
amethyst
hue
as
smooth
and
delicate
as
the
glossy
pale
tint
of
the
purple
clematis
and
with
it
the
rosy
foam
of
the
fall
graduated
to
varying
tints
of
pink
from
pink
to
tender
green
and
lastly
it
became
as
a
shower
of
amber
wine
güldmar
spoke
first
in
a
voice
broken
by
deep
emotion
is
all
over
with
him
poor
lad
he
said
and
tears
glittered
thickly
in
his
keen
old
eyes
and
though
the
gods
of
a
surety
know
best
this
is
an
end
i
looked
not
for
a
mournful
shall
we
have
for
how
to
break
the
news
to
thelma
is
more
than
i
can
tell
and
he
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
while
returning
the
warm
and
sympathizing
pressure
of
errington
hand
you
see
he
went
on
with
a
wistful
look
at
the
grave
and
compassionate
face
of
his
accepted
the
boy
was
no
boy
of
mine
is
true
and
the
winds
had
more
than
their
share
of
his
wits
yet
we
knew
him
from
a
baby
and
my
wife
loved
him
for
his
sad
estate
which
he
was
not
to
blame
for
thelma
too
he
was
her
first
playmate
the
could
trust
himself
to
say
no
more
but
turned
abruptly
away
brushing
one
hand
across
his
eyes
and
was
silent
for
many
minutes
the
young
men
too
were
silent
sigurd
determined
suicide
had
chilled
and
sickened
them
slowly
they
returned
to
the
hut
to
pass
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
though
sleep
was
of
course
after
what
they
had
witnessed
impossible
they
remained
awake
therefore
talking
in
low
tones
of
the
fatal
event
and
listening
to
the
solemn
of
the
wind
through
the
pines
that
sounded
to
errington
ears
like
a
monotonous
forest
dirge
he
thought
of
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
the
unhappy
creature
whose
wandering
days
had
just
ended
of
that
scene
in
the
mysterious
shell
cavern
of
the
wild
words
he
had
then
uttered
how
strangely
they
came
back
to
philip
memory
now
you
have
come
as
a
thief
in
the
golden
midnight
and
the
thing
you
seek
is
the
life
of
sigurd
yes
yes
it
is
true
the
spirit
can
not
lie
you
must
kill
you
must
steal
see
how
the
blood
drips
drop
by
drop
from
the
heart
of
sigurd
and
the
jewel
you
steal
ah
what
a
jewel
you
shall
not
find
such
another
in
norway
was
not
the
hidden
meaning
of
these
incoherent
phrases
rendered
somewhat
clear
now
though
how
the
poor
lad
disordered
imagination
had
been
able
thus
promptly
to
conjure
up
with
such
correctness
an
idea
of
errington
future
relations
with
thelma
was
a
riddle
impossible
of
explanation
he
thought
too
with
a
sort
of
generous
remorse
of
that
occasion
when
sigurd
had
visited
him
on
board
the
yacht
to
implore
him
to
leave
the
altenfjord
he
realized
everything
the
inchoate
desires
of
the
desolate
being
who
though
intensely
capable
of
loving
felt
himself
in
a
dim
sad
way
unworthy
of
love
the
struggling
passions
in
him
that
clamored
for
utterance
the
instinctive
dread
and
jealousy
of
a
rival
while
knowing
that
he
was
both
physically
and
mentally
unfitted
to
compete
with
one
all
these
things
passed
through
philip
mind
and
filled
him
with
a
most
profound
pity
for
the
hidden
sufferings
the
tortures
and
inexplicable
emotions
which
had
racked
sigurd
darkened
soul
and
still
busy
with
these
reflections
he
turned
on
his
arm
as
he
lay
and
whispered
softly
to
his
friend
who
was
close
by
him
i
say
lorimer
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
to
blame
somehow
in
this
affair
if
i
had
never
come
on
the
scene
sigurd
would
still
have
been
happy
in
his
own
way
lorimer
was
silent
after
a
pause
errington
went
on
still
in
the
same
low
tone
poor
little
fellow
do
you
know
i
ca
imagine
anything
more
utterly
distracting
than
having
to
see
such
a
woman
as
thelma
day
after
day
loving
her
all
the
time
and
knowing
such
love
to
be
absolutely
hopeless
why
it
was
enough
to
make
him
crazier
than
ever
lorimer
moved
restlessly
yes
it
must
have
been
hard
on
him
he
answered
at
last
in
a
gentle
somewhat
sad
tone
perhaps
it
as
well
he
out
of
it
all
life
is
infinitely
perplexing
to
many
of
us
by
this
time
he
no
doubt
wiser
than
you
or
i
phil
he
could
tell
us
the
reason
why
love
is
such
a
blessing
to
some
men
and
such
a
curse
to
others
errington
made
no
answer
and
they
relapsed
into
silence
silence
which
was
almost
unbroken
save
by
an
occasional
deep
sigh
from
olaf
güldmar
and
a
smothered
exclamation
such
as
poor
lad
poor
lad
who
would
have
thought
it
with
the
early
dawn
they
were
all
up
and
ready
for
the
homeward
journey
though
with
very
different
feelings
to
those
with
which
they
had
started
on
their
expedition
the
morning
was
dazzlingly
bright
and
clear
and
the
cataract
of
njedegorze
rolled
down
in
glittering
folds
of
creamy
white
and
green
uttering
its
ceaseless
psalm
of
praise
to
the
creator
in
a
jubilant
roar
of
musical
thunder
they
paused
and
looked
at
it
for
the
last
time
before
leaving
it
had
assumed
for
them
a
new
and
solemn
aspect
it
was
sigurd
grave
the
raised
his
cap
from
his
rough
white
hair
instinctively
the
others
followed
his
example
may
the
gods
grant
him
good
rest
said
the
old
man
reverently
in
the
wildest
waters
they
say
there
is
a
calm
underflow
maybe
the
lad
has
found
it
and
is
glad
to
sleep
he
paused
and
stretched
his
hands
forth
with
an
eloquent
and
touching
gesture
peace
be
with
him
then
without
more
words
and
as
though
disdaining
his
own
emotion
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
began
to
descend
the
stony
and
precipitous
hill
up
which
sigurd
had
so
skillfully
guided
them
the
day
before
macfarlane
and
duprèz
followed
him
close
macfarlane
casting
more
than
once
a
keen
look
over
the
rapids
is
a
pity
we
couldna
find
his
body
he
said
in
a
low
tone
duprèz
shrugged
his
shoulders
sigurd
death
had
shocked
him
considerably
by
its
suddenness
but
he
was
too
much
of
a
volatile
frenchman
to
be
morbidly
anxious
about
securing
the
corpse
i
think
not
so
at
all
he
said
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
grieve
to
make
her
cry
that
would
be
cruel
i
would
not
assist
in
it
a
dead
body
is
not
a
sight
for
ladies
believe
me
things
are
best
as
they
are
they
went
on
while
errington
and
lorimer
lingered
yet
a
moment
longer
a
magnificent
sepulchre
said
lorimer
dreamily
eyeing
for
the
last
time
the
sweeping
flow
of
the
glittering
torrent
better
than
all
the
monuments
ever
erected
upon
my
life
i
would
not
mind
having
such
a
grave
myself
say
what
you
like
phil
there
was
something
grand
in
sigurd
choice
of
a
death
we
all
of
us
have
to
get
out
of
life
somehow
one
day
that
certain
but
few
of
us
have
the
chance
of
making
such
a
triumphant
exit
errington
looked
at
him
with
a
grave
smile
how
you
talk
george
he
said
one
would
think
you
envied
the
end
of
that
unfortunate
fellow
you
no
reason
to
be
tired
of
your
life
i
sure
all
your
bright
days
are
before
you
are
they
and
lorimer
blue
eyes
looked
slightly
melancholy
well
i
dare
say
they
are
let
hope
so
at
all
events
there
need
be
something
before
me
there
is
much
behind
except
wasted
opportunities
come
on
phil
they
resumed
their
walk
and
soon
rejoined
the
others
the
journey
back
to
the
altenfjord
was
continued
all
day
with
but
one
or
two
interruptions
for
rest
and
refreshment
it
was
decided
that
on
reaching
home
old
güldmar
should
proceed
a
little
in
advance
in
order
to
see
his
daughter
alone
first
and
break
to
her
the
news
of
the
tragic
event
that
had
occurred
so
that
when
after
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
they
caught
sight
at
about
eight
in
the
evening
of
the
familiar
farmhouse
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
that
surrounded
and
sheltered
it
they
all
came
to
a
halt
the
young
men
seated
themselves
on
a
pleasant
knoll
under
some
tall
pines
there
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
while
the
went
forward
to
prepare
thelma
on
second
thoughts
the
old
man
asked
errington
to
accompany
him
a
request
to
which
he
very
readily
acceded
and
these
two
leaving
the
others
to
follow
at
their
leisure
went
on
their
way
rapidly
they
arrived
at
and
entered
the
garden
their
footsteps
made
a
crunching
noise
on
the
pebbly
path
but
no
welcoming
face
looked
forth
from
any
of
the
windows
of
the
house
the
entrance
door
stood
wide
open
there
was
not
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
but
the
kitten
asleep
in
a
corner
of
the
porch
and
the
doves
drowsing
on
the
roof
in
the
sunshine
the
deserted
air
of
the
place
was
unmistakable
and
güldmar
and
errington
exchanged
looks
of
wonder
not
unmixed
with
alarm
thelma
thelma
called
the
anxiously
there
was
no
response
he
entered
the
house
and
threw
open
the
kitchen
door
there
was
no
fire
and
not
the
slightest
sign
of
any
of
the
usual
preparations
for
supper
britta
shouted
güldmar
still
no
answer
by
the
gods
he
exclaimed
turning
to
the
astonished
philip
this
is
a
strange
thing
where
can
the
girls
be
i
have
never
known
both
of
them
to
be
absent
from
the
house
at
the
same
time
go
down
to
the
shore
my
lad
and
see
if
thelma
boat
is
missing
while
i
search
the
garden
errington
obeyed
hurrying
off
on
his
errand
with
a
heart
beating
fast
from
sudden
fear
and
anxiety
for
he
knew
thelma
was
not
likely
to
have
gone
out
of
her
own
accord
at
the
very
time
she
would
have
naturally
expected
her
father
and
his
friends
back
and
the
absence
of
britta
too
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
extraordinary
he
reached
the
pier
very
speedily
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
boat
was
gone
he
hastened
back
to
report
this
to
güldmar
who
was
making
the
whole
place
resound
with
his
shouts
of
thelma
and
britta
though
he
shouted
altogether
in
vain
maybe
he
said
dubiously
on
hearing
of
the
missing
boat
maybe
the
child
has
gone
on
the
fjord
is
often
her
custom
but
then
where
is
britta
besides
they
must
have
expected
us
they
would
have
prepared
supper
they
would
have
been
watching
for
our
return
no
no
there
is
something
wrong
about
this
is
altogether
unusual
and
he
looked
about
him
in
a
bewildered
way
while
sir
philip
noting
his
uneasiness
grew
more
and
more
uneasy
himself
let
me
go
and
search
for
them
sir
he
said
eagerly
they
may
be
in
the
woods
or
up
towards
the
orchard
güldmar
shook
his
head
and
drew
his
fuzzy
white
brows
together
in
puzzled
meditation
suddenly
he
started
and
struck
his
staff
forcibly
on
the
ground
i
have
it
he
exclaimed
that
old
hag
lovisa
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
by
jove
cried
errington
i
believe
you
right
what
shall
we
do
at
that
moment
lorimer
duprèz
and
macfarlane
came
on
the
scene
thinking
they
had
kept
aloft
long
enough
and
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
two
girls
was
rapidly
explained
to
them
they
listened
astonished
and
almost
incredulous
but
agreed
with
the
as
to
probable
share
in
the
matter
look
here
said
lorimer
excitedly
i
not
in
the
least
tired
show
me
the
way
to
talvig
where
that
old
lives
and
i
go
there
straight
as
a
gun
should
wonder
if
she
has
not
forced
away
her
grandchild
in
which
case
miss
thelma
may
have
gone
after
her
i
come
with
you
said
errington
let
lose
no
time
about
it
but
güldmar
shook
his
head
is
a
long
way
my
lads
and
you
do
not
know
the
road
no
be
better
we
should
take
the
boat
and
pull
over
to
bosekop
there
we
can
get
a
carriole
to
take
two
of
us
at
least
to
talvig
he
stopped
interrupted
by
macfarlane
who
looked
particularly
shrewd
i
should
certainly
advise
ye
to
try
bosekop
first
he
remarked
cautiously
dyceworthy
might
be
able
to
provide
ye
with
valuable
information
dyceworthy
roared
the
becoming
inflammable
at
once
he
knows
little
of
me
or
mine
thank
the
gods
and
i
would
not
by
choice
step
within
a
mile
of
his
dwelling
what
makes
you
think
of
him
sir
lorimer
laid
a
hand
soothingly
on
his
arm
now
my
dear
güldmar
do
get
excited
mac
is
right
i
dare
say
dyceworthy
knows
as
much
in
his
way
as
the
ancient
lovisa
at
any
rate
it
is
his
fault
if
he
does
not
because
you
see
lorimer
hesitated
and
turned
to
errington
you
tell
him
phil
you
know
all
about
it
the
fact
is
said
errington
while
güldmar
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
in
speechless
amazement
thelma
has
told
you
because
she
knew
how
angry
you
be
but
dyceworthy
asked
her
to
marry
him
of
course
she
refused
him
and
i
doubt
if
he
taken
his
rejection
very
resignedly
the
face
of
the
old
farmer
as
he
heard
these
words
was
a
study
wonder
contempt
pride
and
indignation
struggled
for
the
mastery
on
his
rugged
features
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
repeated
slowly
by
the
sword
of
odin
had
i
known
it
i
would
have
throttled
him
his
eyes
blazed
and
he
clenched
his
hand
throttled
him
lads
i
would
give
me
the
chance
and
i
do
it
now
i
tell
you
the
mere
look
of
such
a
man
as
that
is
a
desecration
to
my
child
liar
and
hypocrite
as
he
is
may
the
gods
confound
him
he
paused
then
suddenly
bracing
himself
up
added
away
to
bosekop
at
once
they
been
afraid
of
me
there
for
no
reason
i
teach
them
to
be
afraid
of
me
in
earnest
who
come
with
me
all
eagerly
expressed
their
desire
to
accompany
him
with
the
exception
of
one
pierre
duprèz
he
had
disappeared
why
where
has
he
gone
demanded
lorimer
in
some
surprise
i
canna
tell
replied
macfarlane
he
just
slipped
awa
while
ye
were
haverin
about
dyceworthy
he
maybe
join
us
at
the
shore
to
the
shore
they
at
once
betook
themselves
and
were
soon
busied
in
unmooring
güldmar
own
which
as
it
had
not
been
used
for
some
time
was
rather
a
tedious
business
moreover
they
noted
with
concern
that
the
tide
was
dead
against
them
duprèz
did
not
appear
the
truth
is
that
he
had
taken
into
his
head
to
start
off
for
talvig
on
foot
without
waiting
for
the
others
he
was
fond
of
an
adventure
and
here
was
one
that
suited
him
precisely
to
rescue
distressed
damsels
from
the
grasp
of
persecutors
he
was
tired
but
he
managed
to
find
the
road
and
he
trudged
on
determinedly
humming
a
song
of
beranger
as
he
walked
to
keep
him
cheerful
but
he
had
not
gone
much
more
than
a
mile
when
he
discerned
in
the
distance
a
carriole
approaching
him
and
approaching
so
swiftly
that
it
appeared
to
swing
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
at
imminent
risk
of
upsetting
altogether
there
seemed
to
be
one
person
in
it
an
excited
person
too
who
lashed
the
stout
little
pony
and
urged
it
on
to
fresh
exertions
with
gesticulations
and
cries
that
plump
buxom
figure
that
tumbled
brown
hair
streaming
wildly
on
the
breeze
that
round
rosy
face
why
it
was
britta
britta
driving
all
alone
with
the
reckless
daring
of
a
norwegian
peasant
girl
accustomed
to
the
swaying
jolting
movement
of
the
carriole
as
well
as
the
rough
roads
and
sharp
turnings
nearer
she
came
and
nearer
and
duprèz
hailed
her
with
a
shout
of
welcome
she
saw
him
answered
his
call
and
drove
still
faster
soon
she
came
up
beside
him
and
without
answering
his
amazed
questions
she
cried
breathlessly
jump
in
jump
in
we
must
go
on
as
quickly
as
possible
to
bosekop
quick
quick
oh
my
poor
fröken
the
old
villain
wait
till
i
get
at
him
but
my
child
expostulated
pierre
climbing
up
into
the
queer
vehicle
what
is
all
this
i
am
in
astonishment
i
understand
not
at
all
how
comes
it
that
you
are
run
away
from
home
and
mademoiselle
also
britta
only
waited
till
he
was
safely
seated
and
then
lashed
the
pony
with
redoubled
force
away
they
clattered
at
a
pace
the
frenchman
having
much
ado
to
prevent
himself
from
being
jolted
out
again
on
the
road
it
is
a
wicked
plot
she
then
exclaimed
panting
with
excitement
a
wicked
wicked
plot
this
afternoon
dyceworthy
servant
came
and
brought
sir
philip
card
it
said
that
he
had
met
with
an
accident
and
had
been
brought
back
to
bosekop
and
that
he
wished
the
fröken
to
come
to
him
at
once
of
course
the
darling
believed
it
all
and
she
grew
so
pale
so
pale
and
she
went
straight
away
in
her
boat
all
by
herself
oh
my
dear
my
dear
britta
gasped
for
breath
and
duprèz
soothingly
placed
an
arm
round
her
waist
an
action
which
the
little
maiden
seemed
not
to
be
aware
of
she
resumed
her
story
then
the
fröken
had
not
been
gone
so
very
long
and
i
was
watching
for
her
in
the
garden
when
a
woman
passed
by
a
friend
of
my
grandmother
she
called
out
britta
do
you
know
they
have
got
your
mistress
down
at
talvig
and
they
burn
her
for
a
witch
before
they
sleep
has
gone
to
bosekop
i
answered
i
know
you
tell
a
lie
is
no
lie
said
the
old
woman
lovisa
has
her
this
time
for
sure
and
she
laughed
and
went
away
well
i
did
not
stop
to
think
twice
about
it
i
started
off
for
talvig
at
once
i
ran
nearly
all
the
way
i
found
my
grandmother
alone
i
asked
her
if
she
had
seen
the
fröken
she
screamed
and
clapped
her
hands
like
a
mad
woman
she
said
that
the
fröken
was
with
dyceworthy
dyceworthy
would
know
what
to
do
with
her
ejaculated
duprèz
this
is
serious
britta
glanced
anxiously
at
him
and
went
on
then
she
tried
to
shut
the
doors
upon
me
and
beat
me
but
i
escaped
outside
i
saw
a
man
i
knew
with
his
carriole
and
i
borrowed
it
of
him
and
came
back
as
fast
as
i
could
but
oh
i
am
so
afraid
my
grandmother
said
such
dreadful
things
the
others
have
taken
a
boat
to
bosekop
said
duprèz
to
reassure
her
they
may
be
there
by
now
britta
shook
her
head
the
tide
is
against
them
no
we
shall
be
there
first
but
and
she
looked
wistfully
at
pierre
my
grandmother
said
dyceworthy
had
sworn
to
ruin
the
fröken
what
did
she
mean
do
you
think
duprèz
did
not
answer
he
made
a
strange
grimace
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
seized
the
whip
and
lashed
the
pony
faster
faster
he
cried
to
that
animal
it
is
not
a
time
to
sleep
then
to
britta
my
little
one
you
shall
see
we
shall
disturb
the
good
clergyman
at
his
peaceful
supper
yes
indeed
be
not
afraid
and
with
such
reassuring
remarks
he
beguiled
the
rest
of
the
way
which
to
both
of
them
seemed
unusually
long
though
it
was
not
much
past
nine
when
they
rattled
into
the
little
village
called
by
courtesy
a
town
and
came
to
a
halt
within
a
few
paces
of
the
minister
residence
everything
was
very
quiet
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
retired
to
rest
early
and
the
one
principal
street
was
absolutely
deserted
duprèz
alighted
stay
you
here
britta
he
said
lightly
kissing
the
hand
that
held
the
pony
reins
i
will
make
an
examination
of
the
windows
of
the
house
yes
before
knocking
at
the
door
you
wait
with
patience
i
will
let
you
know
everything
and
with
a
sense
of
pleasurable
excitement
in
his
mind
he
stole
softly
along
on
entered
the
minister
garden
fragrant
with
roses
and
mignonette
and
then
attracted
by
the
sound
of
voices
went
straight
up
to
the
parlor
window
the
blind
was
down
and
he
could
see
nothing
but
he
heard
dyceworthy
bland
persuasive
tones
echoing
out
with
a
soft
sonorousness
as
though
he
were
preaching
to
some
refractory
parishioner
he
listened
attentively
oh
strange
strange
said
dyceworthy
strange
that
you
will
not
see
how
graciously
the
lord
hath
delivered
you
into
my
hands
yea
and
no
escape
is
possible
for
lo
you
yourself
fröken
thelma
dyceworthy
started
you
yourself
came
hither
unto
my
dwelling
a
woman
all
unprotected
to
a
man
equally
unprotected
and
who
though
a
humble
minister
of
saving
grace
is
not
proof
against
the
offered
surrender
of
your
charms
make
the
best
of
it
my
sweet
girl
make
the
best
of
it
you
can
never
undo
what
you
have
done
coward
coward
and
thelma
rich
low
voice
caused
pierre
to
almost
leap
forward
from
the
place
where
he
stood
concealed
you
made
me
come
here
sent
me
that
card
dared
to
use
the
name
of
my
betrothed
husband
to
gain
your
vile
purpose
have
kept
me
locked
in
this
room
all
these
hours
and
do
you
think
you
will
not
be
punished
i
will
let
the
whole
village
know
of
your
treachery
and
falsehood
dyceworthy
laughed
gently
dear
me
dear
me
he
remarked
sweetly
how
pretty
we
look
in
a
passion
to
be
sure
and
we
talk
of
our
husband
do
we
put
that
dream
out
of
your
mind
my
dear
girl
sir
philip
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
after
your
little
escapade
of
your
honor
is
touched
yes
yes
and
honor
is
everything
to
such
a
man
as
he
as
for
the
you
talk
about
i
never
sent
a
card
not
i
dyceworthy
made
this
assertion
in
a
tone
of
injured
honesty
why
should
i
no
no
you
came
here
of
your
own
accord
that
is
certain
and
here
he
spoke
more
slowly
and
with
a
certain
malicious
glee
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
proving
it
to
be
so
should
the
young
man
errington
ask
me
for
an
explanation
now
you
had
better
give
me
a
kiss
and
make
the
peace
there
not
a
soul
in
the
place
who
will
believe
anything
you
say
against
me
a
reputed
witch
and
i
a
minister
of
the
gospel
for
your
father
i
care
nothing
a
poor
sinful
pagan
can
never
injure
a
servant
of
the
lord
come
now
let
me
have
that
kiss
i
have
been
very
patient
i
am
sure
i
deserve
it
there
was
a
sudden
rushing
movement
in
the
room
and
a
slight
cry
if
you
touch
me
cried
thelma
i
will
kill
you
i
will
god
will
help
me
again
dyceworthy
laughed
sneeringly
god
will
help
you
he
exclaimed
as
though
in
wonder
as
if
god
ever
helped
a
fröken
thelma
be
sensible
by
your
strange
visit
to
me
you
have
ruined
your
already
damaged
character
i
say
you
have
ruined
it
and
if
anything
remains
to
be
said
against
you
i
can
say
it
moreover
i
a
crash
of
breaking
followed
these
words
and
before
dyceworthy
could
realize
what
had
happened
he
was
pinioned
against
his
own
wall
by
an
active
wiry
excited
individual
whose
black
eyes
sparkled
with
gratified
rage
whose
clenched
fist
was
dealing
him
severe
thumps
all
over
his
fat
body
ha
ha
you
will
will
you
cried
duprèz
literally
dancing
up
against
him
and
squeezing
him
as
though
he
were
a
jelly
you
will
tell
lies
in
the
service
of
bon
no
not
quite
not
yet
and
still
pinioning
him
with
one
hand
he
dragged
at
his
collar
with
the
other
till
he
succeeded
in
spite
of
the
minister
unwieldly
efforts
to
defend
himself
in
rolling
him
down
upon
the
floor
where
he
knelt
upon
him
in
triumph
je
sais
faire
la
boxe
moi
then
turning
to
thelma
who
stood
an
amazed
spectator
of
the
scene
her
flushed
cheeks
and
eyes
testifying
to
the
misery
of
the
hours
she
had
passed
he
said
run
mademoiselle
run
the
little
britta
is
outside
she
has
a
she
will
drive
you
home
i
will
stay
here
till
comes
i
shall
enjoy
myself
i
will
begin
with
finish
then
we
will
return
to
you
thelma
needed
no
more
words
she
rushed
to
the
door
threw
it
open
and
vanished
like
a
bird
in
air
britta
joy
at
seeing
her
was
too
great
for
more
than
an
exclamation
of
welcome
and
the
carriole
with
the
two
girls
safely
in
it
was
soon
on
its
rapid
way
back
to
the
farm
meanwhile
olaf
güldmar
with
errington
and
the
others
had
just
landed
at
bosekop
after
a
heavy
pull
across
the
fjord
and
they
made
straight
for
dyceworthy
house
the
working
himself
up
as
he
walked
into
a
positive
volcano
of
wrath
finding
the
open
as
it
had
just
been
left
by
the
escaped
thelma
they
entered
and
on
the
threshold
of
the
parlor
stopped
abruptly
in
amazement
at
the
sight
that
presented
itself
two
figures
were
rolling
about
on
the
floor
apparently
in
a
close
embrace
one
large
and
cumbrous
the
other
small
and
slight
sometimes
they
shook
each
other
sometimes
they
lay
still
sometimes
they
recommenced
rolling
both
were
perfectly
silent
save
that
the
larger
personage
seemed
to
breathe
somewhat
heavily
lorimer
stepped
into
the
room
to
secure
a
better
view
then
he
broke
into
an
irrepressible
laugh
it
duprèz
he
cried
for
the
benefit
of
the
others
that
stood
at
the
door
by
jove
how
did
he
get
here
i
wonder
hearing
his
name
duprèz
looked
up
from
that
portion
of
form
in
which
he
had
been
burrowing
and
smiled
radiantly
ah
lorimer
put
your
knee
here
will
you
so
that
is
well
i
will
rest
myself
and
he
rose
smoothing
his
roughened
hair
with
both
hands
while
lorimer
in
obedience
to
his
request
kept
one
knee
artistically
pressed
on
the
recumbent
figure
of
the
minister
ah
and
there
is
our
and
sandy
and
monsieur
güldmar
but
i
do
not
think
here
he
beamed
all
over
there
is
much
more
to
be
done
he
is
one
bruise
i
assure
you
he
will
not
preach
for
many
sundays
it
is
bad
to
be
so
fat
he
will
be
so
exceedingly
suffering
errington
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
pierre
equanimity
but
what
has
happened
he
asked
is
thelma
here
she
here
answered
duprèz
the
religious
had
decoyed
her
here
by
means
of
some
false
writing
supposed
to
be
from
you
he
kept
her
locked
up
here
the
whole
afternoon
when
i
came
he
was
making
love
and
frightening
her
i
am
pleased
i
was
in
time
but
and
he
smiled
again
he
is
well
beaten
sir
philip
strode
up
to
the
fallen
dyceworthy
his
face
darkening
with
wrath
let
him
go
lorimer
he
said
sternly
then
as
the
reverend
gentleman
slowly
struggled
to
his
feet
moaning
with
pain
he
demanded
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
sir
be
thankful
if
i
do
not
give
you
the
you
deserve
you
scoundrel
let
me
get
at
him
vociferated
güldmar
at
this
juncture
struggling
to
free
himself
from
the
close
grasp
of
the
prudent
macfarlane
i
have
longed
for
such
a
chance
let
me
get
at
him
but
lorimer
assisted
to
restrain
him
from
springing
forward
and
the
old
man
chafed
and
swore
by
his
gods
in
vain
dyceworthy
meanwhile
meekly
raised
his
eyes
and
folded
his
hands
with
a
sort
of
pious
resignation
i
have
been
set
upon
and
cruelly
abused
he
said
mournfully
and
there
is
no
part
of
me
without
ache
and
soreness
he
sighed
deeply
but
i
am
punished
rightly
for
yielding
unto
carnal
temptation
put
before
me
in
the
form
of
the
maiden
who
came
hither
unto
me
with
delusive
entrancements
he
stopped
shrinking
back
in
alarm
from
the
suddenly
raised
fist
of
the
young
baronet
you
better
be
careful
remarked
philip
coolly
with
dangerously
flashing
eyes
there
are
four
of
us
here
remember
dyceworthy
coughed
and
resumed
an
air
of
outraged
dignity
truly
i
am
aware
of
it
he
said
and
it
surpriseth
me
not
at
all
that
the
number
of
the
ungodly
outweigheth
that
of
the
righteous
alas
do
the
heathen
rage
so
furiously
together
why
indeed
except
that
their
hearts
they
imagine
a
vain
thing
i
pardon
you
sir
philip
i
freely
pardon
you
and
you
also
sir
turning
gravely
to
duprèz
who
received
his
forgiveness
with
a
cheerful
and
delighted
bow
you
can
indeed
injure
and
you
injured
this
poor
body
of
mine
but
you
can
not
touch
the
no
nor
can
you
hinder
that
freedom
of
speech
here
his
malignant
smile
was
truly
diabolical
which
is
my
glory
and
which
shall
forever
be
uplifted
against
all
manner
of
whether
they
be
fair
women
and
witches
or
misguided
pagans
again
he
paused
rather
astonished
at
errington
scornful
laugh
you
low
fellow
said
the
baronet
from
yorkshire
are
you
well
i
happen
to
know
a
good
many
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
and
i
have
some
influence
there
too
now
understand
me
i
have
you
hounded
out
of
the
place
you
shall
find
it
too
hot
to
hold
you
that
i
swear
remember
i
a
man
of
my
word
and
if
you
dare
to
mention
the
name
of
miss
güldmar
disrespectfully
i
thrash
you
within
an
inch
of
your
life
dyceworthy
blinked
feebly
and
drew
out
his
handkerchief
i
trust
sir
philip
he
said
mildly
you
will
reconsider
your
words
it
would
ill
beseem
you
to
strive
to
do
me
harm
in
the
parish
were
my
ministrations
are
welcome
as
appealing
to
that
portion
of
the
people
who
follow
the
godly
luther
oh
yes
and
he
smiled
cheerfully
you
will
reconsider
your
words
in
the
meantime
i
i
he
stammered
slightly
i
apologize
i
meant
naught
but
good
to
the
maiden
but
i
have
been
misunderstood
as
is
ever
the
case
with
the
servants
of
the
lord
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
i
forgive
let
us
all
forgive
i
will
even
extend
my
pardon
to
the
pagan
yonder
but
the
pagan
at
that
moment
broke
loose
from
the
friendly
grasp
in
which
he
had
been
hitherto
held
and
strode
up
to
the
minister
who
recoiled
like
a
beaten
cur
from
the
look
of
that
fine
old
face
flushed
with
just
indignation
and
those
clear
blue
eyes
fiery
as
the
flash
of
steel
pagan
you
call
me
he
cried
i
thank
the
gods
for
it
i
am
proud
of
the
title
i
would
rather
be
the
veriest
savage
that
ever
knelt
in
untutored
worship
to
the
great
forces
of
nature
than
such
a
as
you
a
slinking
unclean
animal
crawling
between
earth
and
sky
and
daring
to
call
itself
a
faugh
were
i
the
christ
i
should
sicken
at
sight
of
you
dyceworthy
made
no
reply
but
his
little
eyes
glittered
evilly
errington
not
desiring
any
further
prolongation
of
the
scene
managed
to
draw
the
irate
away
saying
in
a
low
tone
we
had
enough
of
this
sir
let
us
get
home
to
thelma
i
was
about
to
suggest
a
move
added
lorimer
we
are
only
wasting
time
here
ah
exclaimed
duprèz
radiantly
and
monsieur
dyceworthy
will
be
glad
to
be
in
bed
he
will
be
very
stiff
i
am
sure
here
is
a
lady
who
will
attend
him
this
with
a
courteous
salute
to
the
ulrika
who
suddenly
confronted
them
in
the
little
passage
she
seemed
surprised
to
see
them
and
spoke
in
a
monotonous
dreamy
tone
as
though
she
walked
in
her
sleep
the
girl
has
gone
she
added
slowly
duprèz
nodded
briskly
she
has
gone
and
let
me
tell
you
madame
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
she
would
not
have
come
here
at
all
you
took
that
card
to
her
ulrika
frowned
i
was
compelled
she
said
made
me
take
it
i
promised
she
turned
her
dull
eyes
slowly
on
güldmar
it
was
fault
ask
lovisa
about
it
she
paused
and
moistened
her
dry
lips
with
her
tongue
where
is
your
crazy
lad
she
asked
almost
anxiously
did
he
come
with
you
he
is
dead
answered
güldmar
with
grave
coldness
dead
and
to
their
utter
amazement
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
wild
laughter
dead
thank
god
thank
god
dead
and
through
no
fault
of
mine
the
lord
be
praised
he
was
only
fit
for
death
never
mind
how
he
died
it
is
enough
that
he
is
dead
dead
i
shall
see
him
no
more
he
can
not
curse
me
again
the
lord
be
thankful
for
all
his
mercies
and
her
laughter
ceased
she
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
broke
into
a
passion
of
weeping
the
woman
must
be
crazy
exclaimed
the
thoroughly
mystified
then
placing
his
arm
through
errington
he
said
impatiently
you
right
my
lad
we
had
enough
of
this
let
us
shake
the
dust
of
this
accursed
place
off
our
feet
and
get
home
tired
out
they
left
the
minister
dwelling
and
made
straight
for
the
shore
and
were
soon
well
on
their
journey
back
to
the
farm
across
the
fjord
this
time
the
tide
was
with
them
the
evening
was
magnificent
and
the
coolness
of
the
breeze
the
fresh
lapping
of
the
water
against
the
boat
and
the
brilliant
tranquility
of
the
landscape
soon
calmed
their
feelings
thelma
was
waiting
for
them
under
the
porch
as
usual
looking
a
trifle
paler
than
her
wont
after
all
the
worry
and
fright
and
suspense
she
had
undergone
but
the
caresses
of
her
father
and
lover
soon
brought
back
the
rosy
warmth
on
her
fair
face
and
restored
the
lustre
to
her
eyes
nothing
was
said
about
sigurd
fate
just
then
when
she
asked
for
her
faithful
servitor
she
was
told
he
had
gone
wandering
as
usual
and
it
was
not
till
errington
and
his
friends
returned
to
their
yacht
that
old
güldmar
left
alone
with
his
daughter
broke
the
sad
news
to
her
very
gently
but
the
shock
so
unexpected
and
terrible
was
almost
too
much
for
her
already
overwrought
nerves
and
such
tears
were
shed
for
sigurd
as
sigurd
himself
might
have
noted
with
gratitude
sigurd
the
loving
devoted
sigurd
gone
for
ever
sigurd
her
playmate
her
servant
her
worshiper
dead
ah
how
tenderly
she
mourned
him
how
regretfully
she
thought
of
his
wild
words
mistress
you
are
killing
poor
sigurd
wistfully
she
wondered
if
in
her
absorbing
love
for
philip
she
had
neglected
the
poor
crazed
lad
his
face
in
all
its
pale
piteous
appeal
haunted
her
and
her
grief
for
his
loss
was
the
greatest
she
had
ever
known
since
the
day
on
which
she
had
seen
her
mother
sink
into
the
last
long
sleep
britta
too
wept
and
would
not
be
comforted
she
had
been
fond
of
sigurd
in
her
own
impetuous
little
way
and
it
was
some
time
before
either
she
or
her
mistress
could
calm
themselves
sufficiently
to
retire
to
rest
and
long
after
thelma
was
sleeping
with
tears
still
wet
on
her
cheeks
her
father
sat
alone
under
his
porch
lost
in
melancholy
meditation
now
and
then
he
ruffled
his
white
hair
impatiently
with
his
hand
his
daughter
adventure
in
dyceworthy
house
had
vexed
his
proud
spirit
he
knew
well
enough
that
the
minister
apology
meant
nothing
that
the
whole
village
would
be
set
talking
against
thelma
more
even
than
before
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
preventing
scandal
so
long
as
dyceworthy
was
there
to
start
it
he
thought
and
thought
and
puzzled
himself
with
probabilities
till
at
last
when
he
finally
rose
to
enter
his
dwelling
for
the
night
he
muttered
if
it
must
be
it
must
and
the
sooner
the
better
now
i
think
for
the
child
sake
the
next
morning
sir
philip
arrived
unusually
early
and
remained
shut
up
with
the
in
private
conversation
for
more
than
an
hour
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
thelma
was
called
and
taken
into
their
confidence
the
result
of
their
mysterious
discussion
was
not
immediately
evident
though
for
the
next
few
days
the
lost
its
former
tranquility
and
became
a
scene
of
bustle
and
excitement
moreover
to
the
astonishment
of
the
bosekop
folk
the
known
as
the
belonging
to
olaf
güldmar
which
had
been
hauled
up
high
and
dry
on
the
shore
for
many
months
was
suddenly
seen
afloat
on
the
fjord
and
valdemar
svensen
errington
pilot
appeared
to
be
busily
engaged
upon
her
decks
putting
everything
in
order
it
was
no
use
asking
any
questions
he
was
not
the
man
to
gratify
impertinent
curiosity
a
rumor
got
about
in
the
village
lovisa
had
gained
her
point
in
one
particular
the
güldmars
were
going
away
going
to
leave
the
altenfjord
at
first
the
report
was
received
with
incredulity
but
gained
ground
as
people
began
to
notice
that
several
packages
were
being
taken
in
boats
from
the
to
both
the
and
the
these
preparations
excited
a
great
deal
of
interest
and
inquisitiveness
but
no
one
dared
ask
for
information
as
to
what
was
about
to
happen
the
reverend
dyceworthy
was
confined
to
his
bed
from
a
severe
cold
as
he
said
and
therefore
was
unable
to
perform
his
favorite
mission
of
spy
so
that
when
one
brilliant
morning
bosekop
was
startled
by
the
of
the
blowing
furiously
and
echoing
far
and
wide
across
the
surrounding
rocky
islands
several
of
the
lounging
inhabitants
paused
on
the
shore
or
sauntered
down
to
the
rickety
pier
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
the
clamor
even
the
minister
crawled
out
of
bed
and
applied
his
fat
meek
visage
to
his
window
from
whence
he
could
command
an
almost
uninterrupted
view
of
the
glittering
water
great
was
his
amazement
and
discomfiture
to
see
the
magnificent
yacht
moving
majestically
out
of
the
fjord
with
güldmar
brig
in
tow
behind
her
and
the
english
flag
fluttering
gaily
from
her
as
she
curtsied
her
farewell
to
the
dark
mountains
and
glided
swiftly
over
the
little
hissing
waves
had
dyceworthy
been
possessed
of
a
he
might
have
been
able
to
discern
on
her
deck
the
figure
of
a
tall
fair
girl
who
drawing
her
crimson
hood
over
her
rich
hair
stood
gazing
with
wistful
dreamy
blue
eyes
at
the
last
receding
shores
of
the
altenfjord
eyes
that
smiled
and
yet
were
tearful
are
you
sorry
thelma
asked
errington
gently
as
he
passed
one
arm
tenderly
round
her
sorry
to
trust
your
life
to
me
she
laid
her
little
hand
in
playful
reproach
against
his
lips
sorry
you
foolish
boy
i
am
glad
and
grateful
but
it
is
saying
to
one
old
life
is
it
not
the
dear
old
home
and
poor
sigurd
her
voice
trembled
and
bright
tears
fell
sigurd
is
happy
said
errington
gravely
taking
the
hand
that
caressed
him
and
reverently
kissing
it
believe
me
love
if
he
had
lived
some
cruel
misery
might
have
befallen
him
it
is
better
as
it
is
thelma
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
said
suddenly
philip
do
you
remember
where
i
saw
you
first
perfectly
he
answered
looking
fondly
into
the
sweet
upturned
face
outside
a
wonderful
cavern
which
i
afterwards
explored
she
started
and
seemed
surprised
you
went
inside
you
saw
everything
and
philip
related
his
adventure
of
that
morning
and
his
first
interview
with
sigurd
she
listened
attentively
then
she
whispered
softly
my
mother
sleeps
there
you
know
yesterday
i
went
to
take
her
some
flowers
for
the
last
time
father
came
with
me
we
asked
her
blessing
and
i
think
she
will
give
it
philip
she
must
know
how
good
you
are
and
how
happy
i
am
he
stroked
her
silky
hair
tenderly
and
was
silent
the
had
reached
the
outward
bend
of
the
altenfjord
and
the
station
of
bosekop
was
rapidly
disappearing
olaf
güldmar
and
the
others
came
on
deck
to
take
their
last
look
of
it
i
shall
see
the
old
place
again
i
doubt
not
long
before
you
do
thelma
child
said
the
stout
old
viewing
with
a
keen
fond
glance
the
stretch
of
the
vanishing
scenery
though
when
once
you
are
safe
married
at
christiania
valdemar
svensen
and
i
will
have
a
fine
toss
on
the
seas
in
the
and
i
shall
grow
young
again
in
the
storm
and
drift
of
the
foam
and
the
dark
wild
waves
yes
a
wandering
life
suits
me
and
i
am
not
sorry
to
have
a
taste
of
it
once
more
there
nothing
like
it
nothing
like
a
broad
ocean
and
a
sweeping
wind
and
he
lifted
his
cap
and
drew
himself
erect
inhaling
the
air
like
an
old
warrior
scenting
battle
the
others
listened
amused
at
his
enthusiasm
and
meanwhile
the
altenfjord
altogether
disappeared
and
the
was
soon
plunging
in
a
rougher
sea
they
were
bound
for
christiania
where
it
was
decided
thelma
marriage
should
at
once
take
place
after
which
sir
philip
would
leave
his
yacht
at
the
disposal
of
his
friends
for
them
to
return
in
it
to
england
he
himself
intended
to
start
directly
for
germany
with
his
bride
a
trip
in
which
britta
was
to
accompany
them
as
thelma
maid
olaf
güldmar
as
he
had
just
stated
purposed
making
a
voyage
in
the
as
soon
as
he
should
get
her
properly
manned
and
fitted
which
he
meant
to
do
at
christiania
such
were
their
plans
and
meanwhile
they
were
all
together
on
the
a
happy
and
sociable
party
errington
having
resigned
his
cabin
to
the
use
of
his
fair
betrothed
and
her
little
maid
whose
delight
at
the
novel
change
in
her
life
and
her
escape
from
the
persecution
of
her
grandmother
was
extreme
onward
they
sailed
past
the
grand
lofoden
islands
and
all
the
magnificent
scenery
extending
thence
to
christiansund
while
the
inhabitants
of
bosekop
looked
in
vain
for
their
return
to
the
altenfjord
the
short
summer
there
was
beginning
to
draw
to
a
close
some
of
the
birds
took
their
departure
from
the
coast
the
dull
routine
of
the
place
went
on
as
usual
rendered
even
duller
by
the
absence
of
the
witch
element
of
discord
a
circumstance
that
had
kept
the
superstitious
villagers
more
or
less
on
a
lively
tension
of
religious
and
resentful
excitement
and
the
rightful
minister
of
bosekop
came
back
to
his
duties
and
released
the
reverend
charles
dyceworthy
who
straightway
returned
to
his
loving
flock
in
yorkshire
it
was
difficult
to
ascertain
whether
the
aged
lovisa
was
satisfied
or
wrathful
at
the
departure
of
the
güldmars
with
her
granddaughter
britta
in
their
company
she
kept
herself
almost
buried
in
her
hut
at
talvig
and
saw
no
one
but
ulrika
who
seemed
to
grow
more
respectably
staid
than
ever
and
who
as
a
prominent
member
of
the
lutheran
congregation
distinguished
herself
greatly
by
her
godly
bearing
and
uncompromising
gloom
little
by
little
the
gossips
ceased
to
talk
about
the
disappearance
of
the
white
witch
and
her
father
little
by
little
they
ceased
to
speculate
as
to
whether
the
rich
englishman
sir
philip
errington
really
meant
to
marry
her
a
consummation
of
things
which
none
of
them
seemed
to
think
likely
the
absence
of
their
hated
neighbors
was
felt
by
them
as
a
relief
while
the
rumored
fate
of
the
crazy
sigurd
was
of
course
looked
upon
as
evidence
of
fresh
crime
on
the
part
of
the
pagan
who
was
accused
of
having
in
some
way
or
other
caused
the
unfortunate
lad
death
and
the
old
on
the
knoll
was
shut
up
and
silent
its
doors
and
windows
safely
barred
against
wind
and
rain
and
only
the
doves
left
to
forage
for
themselves
crooned
upon
its
roof
all
day
or
strutting
on
the
deserted
paths
ruffled
their
plumage
in
melancholy
meditation
as
though
wondering
at
the
absence
of
the
fair
ruling
spirit
of
the
place
whose
smile
had
been
brighter
than
the
sunshine
the
villagers
avoided
it
as
though
it
were
haunted
the
roses
drooped
and
died
untended
and
by
degrees
the
old
homestead
grew
to
look
like
a
quaint
little
picture
of
forgotten
joys
with
its
deserted
porch
and
fading
flowers
meanwhile
a
thrill
of
amazement
incredulity
disappointment
indignation
and
horror
rushed
like
a
violent
electric
shock
through
the
upper
circles
of
london
society
arousing
the
deepest
disgust
in
the
breasts
of
matrons
and
seriously
ruffling
the
pretty
feathers
of
certain
beauties
who
had
just
began
to
try
their
wings
and
who
had
expectations
the
cause
of
the
sensation
was
very
simple
it
was
an
announcement
in
the
under
the
head
of
marriages
and
ran
as
follows
at
the
english
consulate
christiania
sir
philip
to
thelma
only
daughter
of
olaf
güldmar
of
the
altenfjord

the
land
of
mockery
chapter
xviii
there
nothing
serious
in
mortality
all
is
but
toys
macbeth
i
think
said
deliberately
laying
down
the
beside
her
i
think
his
conduct
is
perfectly
disgraceful
a
lean
gentleman
with
a
sallow
face
and
an
apologetic
almost
frightened
manner
looked
up
hastily
of
whom
are
you
speaking
my
dear
he
inquired
why
of
that
wretched
young
man
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
and
marvelle
fixed
her
glasses
more
firmly
on
her
small
nose
and
regarded
her
husband
almost
reproachfully
do
tell
me
montague
that
you
forgotten
that
scandal
about
him
he
went
off
last
year
in
the
middle
of
the
season
to
norway
in
his
yacht
with
three
of
the
very
fastest
fellows
he
could
pick
out
from
his
acquaintance
regular
reprobates
so
i
told
and
after
leading
the
most
awful
life
out
there
making
love
to
all
the
peasant
girls
in
the
place
he
married
one
of
them
a
common
farmer
daughter
do
you
remember
we
saw
the
announcement
of
his
marriage
in
the
ah
yes
yes
and
smiled
a
propitiatory
smile
intended
to
soothe
the
evidently
irritated
feelings
of
his
of
whom
he
stood
always
in
awe
of
course
of
course
a
very
sad
yes
yes
poor
fellow
and
is
there
fresh
news
of
him
read
and
the
lady
handed
the
across
the
table
indicating
by
a
dent
of
her
polished
the
paragraph
that
had
offended
her
sense
of
social
dignity
marvelle
read
it
with
almost
laborious
care
though
it
was
remarkably
short
and
easy
of
comprehension
sir
philip
and
lady
have
arrived
at
their
house
in
prince
gate
from
errington
manor
well
my
dear
he
inquired
with
a
furtive
and
anxious
glance
at
his
wife
i
suppose
er
it
er
it
was
to
be
expected
no
it
was
to
be
expected
said
rearing
her
head
and
heaving
her
ample
bosom
to
and
fro
in
rather
a
tumultuous
manner
of
course
it
was
to
be
expected
that
would
behave
like
a
fool
his
father
was
a
fool
before
him
but
i
say
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
he
would
outrage
society
by
bringing
that
common
wife
of
his
to
london
and
expecting
to
receive
her
the
thing
is
perfectly
scandalous
he
has
had
the
decency
to
keep
away
from
town
ever
since
his
marriage
part
of
the
time
he
has
staid
abroad
and
since
january
he
has
been
at
his
place
in
warwickshire
and
this
time
observe
this
and
marvelle
looked
most
impressive
not
a
soul
has
been
invited
to
the
manor
not
a
living
soul
the
house
used
to
be
full
of
people
during
the
winter
season
of
course
now
he
dare
not
ask
anybody
lest
they
should
be
shocked
at
his
wife
ignorance
as
clear
as
daylight
and
now
he
has
the
impudence
to
actually
bring
her
here
into
good
heavens
he
must
be
mad
he
will
be
laughed
at
wherever
he
goes
scratched
his
bony
chin
perplexedly
it
makes
it
a
little
awkward
for
for
you
he
remarked
feelingly
awkward
it
is
abominable
and
marvelle
rose
from
her
chair
and
shook
out
the
voluminous
train
of
her
silken
an
elaborate
combination
of
crimson
with
grey
chinchilla
fur
i
shall
have
to
call
on
the
creature
just
imagine
it
it
is
most
unfortunate
for
me
that
i
happen
to
be
one
of
oldest
friends
otherwise
i
might
have
passed
him
over
in
some
way
as
it
is
i
ca
but
fancy
having
to
meet
a
great
coarse
peasant
woman
who
i
certain
will
only
be
able
to
talk
about
fish
and
it
is
really
dreadful
permitted
himself
to
smile
faintly
let
us
hope
she
will
not
turn
out
so
badly
he
said
soothingly
but
you
know
if
she
proves
to
be
er
a
common
person
of
er
a
very
uneducated
type
you
can
always
let
her
drop
gently
quite
gently
and
he
waved
his
skinny
hand
with
an
explanatory
flourish
but
marvelle
did
not
accept
his
suggestion
in
good
part
you
know
nothing
about
it
she
said
somewhat
testily
keep
to
your
own
business
montague
such
as
it
is
the
law
suits
your
particular
form
of
brain
society
does
not
you
would
never
be
in
society
at
all
if
it
were
not
for
me
now
you
know
you
would
my
love
said
marvelle
with
a
look
of
meek
admiration
at
his
wife
majestic
proportions
i
am
aware
of
it
i
always
do
you
justice
you
are
a
remarkable
woman
marvelle
smiled
somewhat
mollified
you
see
she
then
condescended
to
explain
the
whole
thing
is
so
extremely
disappointing
to
me
i
wanted
marcia
van
clupp
to
go
in
for
the
errington
stakes
it
would
have
been
such
an
excellent
match
money
on
both
sides
and
marcia
would
have
been
just
the
girl
to
look
after
that
place
down
in
warwickshire
the
house
is
going
to
rack
and
ruin
in
opinion
ah
yes
agreed
her
husband
mildly
van
clupp
is
a
fine
girl
a
fine
girl
no
end
of
in
her
and
so
errington
manor
needs
a
good
deal
of
repairing
perhaps
this
query
was
put
by
marvelle
with
his
head
very
much
on
one
side
and
his
bilious
eyes
blinking
drowsily
i
do
know
about
repairs
replied
marvelle
it
is
a
magnificent
place
and
certainly
the
grounds
are
ravishing
but
one
of
the
best
rooms
in
the
house
is
the
former
lady
errington
boudoir
it
is
full
of
dirty
furniture
and
wo
have
it
touched
he
will
insist
on
keeping
it
as
his
mother
left
it
now
that
is
ridiculous
perfectly
morbid
it
just
the
same
thing
with
his
father
library
he
wo
have
that
touched
either
and
the
ceiling
wants
fresh
paint
and
the
windows
want
new
curtains
and
all
sorts
of
things
ought
to
be
done
marcia
would
have
managed
all
that
splendidly
she
have
had
everything
new
throughout
americans
are
so
quick
and
there
no
nonsensical
antiquated
sentiment
about
marcia
she
might
even
have
had
new
pictures
and
done
away
with
the
old
ones
observed
marvelle
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
satire
his
wife
darted
a
keen
look
at
him
but
smiled
a
little
too
she
was
not
without
a
sense
of
humor
nonsense
montague
she
knows
the
value
of
works
of
art
better
than
many
a
connoisseur
i
wo
have
you
make
fun
of
her
poor
girl
she
speculate
on
you
know
he
was
very
attentive
to
her
at
that
ball
i
gave
just
before
he
went
off
to
norway
he
certainly
seemed
rather
amused
by
her
said
marvelle
did
she
take
it
to
heart
when
she
heard
he
was
married
i
should
think
not
replied
marvelle
loftily
she
has
too
much
sense
she
merely
said
right
i
must
stick
to
masherville
marvelle
nodded
blandly
admirable
admirable
he
murmured
with
a
soft
little
laugh
a
clever
girl
a
very
bright
creature
and
really
there
are
worse
fellows
than
masherville
the
title
is
old
yes
the
title
is
all
very
well
retorted
his
wife
but
there
no
money
or
at
least
very
little
marcia
has
sufficient
to
cover
any
deficit
suggested
marvelle
in
a
tone
of
meek
inquiry
an
american
woman
has
sufficient
declared
marvelle
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
and
poor
dear
van
clupp
has
so
set
her
heart
on
a
really
brilliant
match
for
her
girl
and
i
had
positively
promised
she
should
have
it
is
really
too
bad
and
marvelle
paced
the
room
with
a
stately
sweeping
movement
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
glance
at
herself
approvingly
in
the
mirror
above
the
while
her
husband
resumed
his
perusal
of
the
she
said
abruptly
montague
marvelle
dropped
his
paper
with
an
alarmed
air
my
dear
i
shall
go
to
clara
winsleigh
this
morning
and
see
what
she
means
to
do
in
the
matter
poor
clara
she
must
be
disgusted
at
the
whole
affair
she
had
rather
a
liking
for
errington
had
she
inquired
marvelle
folding
up
the
in
a
neat
parcel
preparatory
to
taking
it
with
him
in
order
to
read
it
in
peace
on
his
way
to
the
law
courts
liking
well
and
marvelle
looking
at
herself
once
more
in
the
glass
carefully
arranged
the
ruffle
of
honiton
lace
about
her
massive
throat
it
was
a
little
more
than
liking
though
of
course
her
feelings
were
perfectly
proper
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
at
least
i
suppose
they
were
she
had
a
great
friendship
for
him
one
of
those
emotional
perfectly
spiritual
and
innocent
attachments
i
believe
which
are
so
rare
in
this
wicked
world
marvelle
sighed
then
suddenly
becoming
practical
again
she
continued
yes
i
shall
go
there
and
stop
to
luncheon
and
talk
this
thing
over
then
i
drive
on
to
the
van
clupps
and
bring
marcia
home
to
dinner
i
suppose
you
object
object
marvelle
made
a
deprecatory
gesture
and
raised
his
eyes
in
wonder
as
if
he
dared
object
to
anything
whatsoever
that
his
wife
desired
she
smiled
graciously
as
he
approached
and
respectfully
kissed
her
smooth
cool
cheek
before
taking
his
departure
for
his
daily
work
as
a
lawyer
in
the
city
and
when
he
was
gone
she
betook
herself
to
her
own
small
boudoir
where
she
busied
herself
for
more
than
an
hour
in
writing
letters
and
answering
invitations
she
was
in
her
own
line
a
person
of
importance
she
made
it
her
business
to
know
everything
and
everybody
she
was
fond
of
meddling
with
other
people
domestic
concerns
and
she
had
a
finger
in
every
family
pie
she
was
moreover
a
regular
fond
of
taking
young
ladies
under
her
maternal
wing
and
introducing
them
to
the
proper
quarters
and
when
as
was
often
the
case
a
distinguished
american
of
many
dollars
but
no
influence
offered
her
three
or
four
hundred
guineas
for
chaperoning
his
daughter
into
english
society
and
marrying
her
well
pocketed
the
quite
gracefully
and
did
her
best
for
the
girl
she
was
a
woman
tall
portly
and
with
an
air
of
distinction
about
her
though
her
features
were
by
no
means
striking
and
the
smallness
of
her
nose
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
majesty
of
her
form
but
she
had
a
very
charming
smile
and
a
pleasant
taking
manner
and
she
was
universally
admired
in
that
particular
set
wherein
she
moved
girls
adored
her
and
wrote
her
gushing
letters
full
of
the
most
dulcet
flatteries
married
ladies
on
the
verge
of
a
scandal
came
to
her
to
help
them
out
of
their
difficulties
old
dowagers
troubled
with
rheumatism
or
refractory
daughters
poured
their
troubles
into
her
sympathizing
ears
in
short
her
hands
were
full
of
other
people
business
to
such
an
extent
that
she
had
scarcely
any
leisure
to
attend
to
her
own
but
why
describe
this
gentleman
at
all
he
was
a
mere
nonentity
known
simply
as
the
husband
of
he
knew
he
was
nobody
and
unlike
many
men
placed
in
a
similar
position
he
was
satisfied
with
his
lot
he
admired
his
wife
intensely
and
never
failed
to
flatter
her
vanity
to
the
utmost
excess
so
that
on
the
whole
they
were
excellent
friends
and
agreed
much
better
than
most
married
people
it
was
about
twelve
in
the
day
when
neat
little
brougham
and
pair
stopped
at
lord
winsleigh
great
house
in
park
lane
a
gorgeous
flunkey
threw
open
the
door
with
a
virtuously
severe
expression
on
his
countenance
an
expression
which
relaxed
into
a
smile
of
condescension
on
seeing
who
the
visitor
was
i
suppose
lady
winsleigh
is
at
home
briggs
inquired
marvelle
with
the
air
of
one
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
household
yes
replied
briggs
slowly
taking
in
the
style
of
bonnet
and
mentally
calculating
its
cost
her
ladyship
is
in
the
i
go
there
said
marvelle
stepping
into
the
hall
and
beginning
to
walk
across
it
in
her
own
important
and
manner
you
need
announce
me
briggs
closed
the
settled
his
powdered
wig
and
looked
after
her
meditatively
then
he
shut
up
one
eye
in
a
sufficiently
laborious
manner
and
grinned
after
this
he
retired
slowly
to
a
small
where
he
found
the
with
its
leaves
uncut
taking
up
his
master
ivory
he
proceeded
to
remedy
this
slight
inconvenience
and
yawning
heavily
he
seated
himself
in
a
velvet
and
was
soon
absorbed
in
perusing
the
pages
of
the
journal
in
question
meanwhile
marvelle
in
her
way
across
the
great
hall
to
the
had
been
interrupted
and
nearly
knocked
down
by
the
playful
embrace
of
a
handsome
boy
who
sprang
out
upon
her
suddenly
with
a
shout
of
laughter
a
boy
of
about
twelve
years
old
with
frank
bright
blue
eyes
and
clustering
dark
curls
hullo
mimsey
cried
this
young
gentleman
here
you
are
again
do
you
want
to
see
papa
papa
in
there
pointing
to
the
door
from
which
he
had
emerged
he
correcting
my
latin
exercise
five
good
marks
and
i
going
to
the
circus
this
afternoon
is
it
jolly
dear
me
ernest
exclaimed
marvelle
half
crossly
yet
with
an
indulgent
smile
i
wish
you
would
not
be
so
boisterous
you
nearly
knocked
my
bonnet
off
no
i
have
laughed
ernest
it
as
straight
as
wait
a
bit
and
waving
a
lead
pencil
in
the
air
he
drew
an
imaginary
stroke
with
it
the
middle
feather
is
bobbing
up
and
down
just
on
a
line
with
your
nose
it
could
be
better
there
go
along
you
silly
boy
said
marvelle
amused
in
spite
of
herself
get
back
to
your
lessons
there
be
no
circus
for
you
if
you
do
behave
properly
i
going
to
see
your
mother
mamma
reading
announced
ernest
mudie
cart
has
just
been
and
brought
a
lot
of
new
novels
mamma
wants
to
finish
them
all
before
night
i
say
are
you
going
to
stop
to
lunch
ernest
why
are
you
making
such
a
noise
in
the
passage
said
a
gentle
grave
voice
at
this
juncture
i
am
waiting
for
you
you
know
you
have
finished
your
work
yet
ah
marvelle
how
do
you
do
and
lord
winsleigh
came
forward
and
shook
hands
you
will
find
her
ladyship
in
i
believe
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
this
young
scapegrace
here
he
caressed
his
son
clustering
curls
tenderly
has
not
yet
done
with
his
lessons
the
idea
of
the
circus
seems
to
have
turned
his
head
papa
you
promised
you
let
me
off
virgil
this
morning
cried
ernest
slipping
his
arm
coaxingly
through
his
father
lord
winsleigh
smiled
shook
her
head
with
a
sort
of
mild
reproachfulness
he
really
ought
to
go
to
school
she
said
feigning
severity
you
will
find
him
too
much
for
you
winsleigh
in
a
little
while
i
think
not
replied
lord
winsleigh
though
an
anxious
look
troubled
for
an
instant
the
calm
of
his
grey
eyes
we
get
on
very
well
together
do
we
ernest
the
boy
glanced
up
fondly
at
his
face
and
nodded
emphatically
at
a
you
see
the
boys
are
educated
on
hard
and
fast
lines
all
ground
down
to
one
pattern
there
no
chance
of
any
originality
possible
but
do
let
me
detain
you
marvelle
you
have
no
doubt
much
to
say
to
lady
winsleigh
come
ernest
if
i
let
you
off
virgil
you
must
do
the
rest
of
your
work
thoroughly
and
with
a
courteous
salute
the
grave
nobleman
his
library
his
young
son
clinging
to
his
arm
and
pouring
forth
boyish
confidences
which
seemingly
received
instant
attention
and
sympathy
while
looked
after
their
retreating
figures
with
something
of
doubt
and
wonder
on
her
placid
features
but
whatever
her
thoughts
they
were
not
made
manifest
just
then
arriving
at
a
door
draped
richly
with
plush
and
satin
she
knocked
come
in
cried
a
voice
that
though
sweet
in
tone
was
also
somewhat
petulant
marvelle
at
once
entered
and
the
occupant
of
the
room
sprang
up
in
haste
from
her
luxurious
where
she
was
having
her
long
tresses
brushed
out
by
a
maid
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
my
dearest
mimsey
she
cried
this
is
quite
too
sweet
of
you
just
the
very
person
i
wanted
to
see
and
she
drew
an
easy
fauteuil
to
the
sparkling
fire
for
the
weather
was
cold
with
that
particularly
cruel
coldness
common
to
an
english
may
and
dismissed
her
attendant
now
sit
down
you
dear
old
darling
she
continued
and
let
me
have
all
the
news
throwing
herself
back
on
her
lounge
she
laughed
and
tossed
her
waving
hair
loose
over
her
shoulders
as
the
maid
had
left
it
then
she
arranged
with
a
coquettish
touch
here
and
there
the
folds
of
her
pale
pink
showered
with
delicate
valenciennes
she
was
undeniably
a
lovely
woman
tall
and
elegantly
formed
with
an
almost
regal
grace
of
manner
clara
lady
winsleigh
deserved
to
be
considered
as
she
was
one
of
the
reigning
beauties
of
the
day
her
full
dark
eyes
were
of
a
bewitching
and
dangerous
softness
her
complexion
was
pale
but
of
such
a
creamy
transparent
pallor
as
to
be
almost
brilliant
her
mouth
was
small
and
exquisitely
shaped
true
her
long
eyelashes
were
not
altogether
innocent
of
kohl
true
there
was
a
faint
odor
about
her
as
of
rare
perfumes
and
cosmetics
true
there
was
something
not
altogether
sincere
or
natural
even
in
her
ravishing
smile
and
fascinating
ways
but
few
save
cynics
could
reasonably
dispute
her
physical
perfections
or
question
the
right
she
had
to
tempt
and
arouse
the
passions
of
men
or
to
trample
underfoot
with
an
air
of
insolent
superiority
the
feelings
of
women
less
fair
and
fortunate
most
of
her
sex
envied
her
but
who
was
past
the
prime
of
life
and
who
moreover
gained
her
social
successes
through
intelligence
and
tact
alone
was
far
too
sensible
to
grudge
any
woman
her
beauty
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
frank
admirer
of
handsome
persons
and
she
surveyed
lady
winsleigh
now
through
her
glasses
with
a
smile
of
bland
approval
you
are
looking
very
well
clara
she
said
let
me
see
you
went
to
kissingen
in
the
summer
did
you
of
course
i
did
laughed
her
ladyship
it
was
delicious
i
suppose
you
know
lennie
came
after
me
there
was
it
ridiculous
marvelle
coughed
dubiously
did
winsleigh
put
in
an
appearance
at
all
she
asked
lady
clara
brow
clouded
oh
yes
for
a
couple
of
weeks
or
so
ernest
came
with
him
of
course
and
they
rambled
about
together
all
the
time
the
boy
enjoyed
it
i
remember
now
said
marvelle
but
i
not
seen
anything
of
you
since
you
came
back
clara
except
once
in
the
park
and
once
at
the
theatre
you
been
all
the
time
at
winsleigh
court
was
sir
francis
lennox
there
too
why
naturally
replied
the
beauty
with
a
cool
smile
he
follows
me
everywhere
like
a
dog
poor
lennie
again
the
elder
lady
coughed
significantly
clara
winsleigh
broke
into
a
ringing
peal
of
laughter
and
rising
from
her
lounge
knelt
beside
her
visitor
in
a
very
pretty
coaxing
attitude
come
mimsey
she
said
you
are
not
going
to
be
proper
at
this
time
of
day
that
would
be
a
joke
darling
indulgent
good
old
mimsey
you
do
mean
to
turn
into
a
prim
prosy
cross
grundy
i
believe
it
and
you
must
be
severe
on
poor
lennie
he
such
a
docile
good
boy
and
really
not
marvelle
fidgeted
a
little
on
her
chair
i
do
want
to
talk
about
as
you
call
him
she
said
rather
testily
only
i
think
you
better
be
careful
how
far
you
go
with
him
i
came
to
consult
you
on
something
quite
different
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
business
you
know
it
was
in
the
post
that
they
arrived
in
town
the
idea
of
sir
philip
bringing
his
common
wife
into
society
it
too
ridiculous
lady
winsleigh
sprang
to
her
feet
and
her
eyes
flashed
disdainfully
what
am
i
going
to
do
she
repeated
in
accents
of
bitter
contempt
why
receive
them
of
course
it
will
be
the
greatest
punishment
can
have
i
get
all
the
best
people
here
that
i
know
and
he
shall
bring
his
peasant
woman
among
them
and
blush
for
her
it
will
be
the
greatest
fun
out
fancy
a
norwegian
farmer
girl
lumbering
along
with
her
great
feet
and
red
hands
and
perhaps
not
knowing
whether
to
eat
an
ice
with
a
spoon
or
with
her
fingers
i
tell
you
will
be
ready
to
die
for
shame
and
serve
him
right
too
marvelle
was
rather
startled
at
the
harsh
derisive
laughter
with
which
her
ladyship
concluded
her
excited
observations
but
she
merely
observed
mildly
well
then
you
will
leave
cards
certainly
very
good
so
shall
i
and
marvelle
sighed
resignedly
what
must
be
must
be
but
it
really
dreadful
to
think
of
it
all
i
would
never
have
believed
philip
errington
could
have
so
disgraced
himself
he
is
no
gentleman
said
lady
winsleigh
freezingly
he
has
low
tastes
and
low
desires
he
and
his
friend
lorimer
are
two
in
my
opinion
clara
exclaimed
marvelle
warningly
you
were
fond
of
him
once
now
do
deny
it
why
should
i
deny
it
and
her
ladyship
dark
eyes
blazed
with
concentrated
fury
i
loved
him
there
i
would
have
done
anything
for
him
he
might
have
trodden
me
down
under
his
feet
he
knew
it
well
enough
cold
cruel
heartless
cynic
as
he
was
and
is
yes
i
loved
him
but
i
him
now
and
she
stamped
her
foot
to
give
emphasis
to
her
wild
words
marvelle
raised
her
hands
and
eyes
in
utter
amazement
clara
clara
pray
pray
be
careful
suppose
any
one
else
heard
you
going
on
in
this
manner
your
reputation
would
suffer
i
assure
you
really
you
horribly
reckless
just
think
of
your
husband
my
husband
and
a
cold
gleam
of
satire
played
round
lady
proud
mouth
she
paused
and
laughed
a
little
then
she
resumed
in
her
old
careless
way
you
must
be
getting
very
mimsey
to
talk
to
me
about
my
husband
why
do
you
read
me
a
lecture
on
the
duties
of
wives
and
the
education
of
children
i
am
sure
you
know
how
profoundly
it
would
interest
me
she
paced
up
and
down
the
room
slowly
while
marvelle
remained
discreetly
silent
presently
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
gorgeous
briggs
entered
he
held
himself
like
an
automaton
and
spoke
as
though
repeating
a
lesson
his
lordship
compliments
and
will
her
lunch
in
the
no
said
lady
winsleigh
curtly
luncheon
for
myself
and
marvelle
can
be
sent
up
here
briggs
still
remained
immovable
his
lordship
wished
to
know
if
master
hernest
was
to
come
to
your
before
goin
out
certainly
not
and
lady
winsleigh
brows
drew
together
in
a
frown
the
boy
is
a
perfect
nuisance
briggs
bowed
and
vanished
grew
more
and
more
restless
she
was
a
woman
and
there
was
something
in
the
nature
of
clara
winsleigh
that
in
spite
of
her
conscience
she
could
not
altogether
approve
of
do
you
never
lunch
with
your
husband
clara
she
asked
at
last
lady
winsleigh
looked
surprised
very
seldom
only
when
there
is
company
and
i
am
compelled
to
be
present
a
domestic
meal
would
be
too
i
wonder
you
can
think
of
such
a
thing
and
we
generally
dine
out
marvelle
was
silent
again
and
when
she
did
speak
it
was
on
a
less
delicate
matter
when
is
your
great
clara
she
inquired
you
sent
me
a
card
but
i
forget
the
date
on
the
replied
lady
winsleigh
this
is
the
fifteenth
i
shall
call
on
lady
here
she
smiled
scornfully
this
afternoon
and
i
shall
send
them
their
invitations
my
only
fear
is
whether
they
may
refuse
to
come
i
would
not
miss
the
chance
for
the
world
i
want
my
house
to
be
the
first
in
which
her
distinguishes
herself
by
her
blunders
i
afraid
it
be
quite
a
scandal
sighed
quite
such
a
pity
was
such
a
promising
handsome
young
man
at
that
moment
briggs
appeared
again
with
an
elegantly
set
which
he
placed
on
the
table
with
a
flourish
order
the
carriage
at
three
commanded
lady
winsleigh
and
tell
marvelle
coachman
that
he
need
wait
i
drive
her
home
myself
but
my
dear
clara
remonstrated
marvelle
i
must
call
at
the
van
clupps
i
call
there
with
you
i
owe
them
a
visit
has
marcia
caught
young
masherville
yet
well
hesitated
marvelle
he
is
rather
slippery
you
know
so
undecided
and
wavering
lady
winsleigh
laughed
never
mind
that
marcia
a
match
for
him
rather
a
taking
girl
only
an
accent
my
nerves
are
on
edge
whenever
i
hear
her
speak
it
a
pity
she
ca
conquer
that
defect
agreed
marvelle
i
know
she
has
tried
but
after
all
they
not
the
best
sort
of
americans
the
sort
i
should
think
not
but
they
of
the
sort
and
that
something
mimsey
besides
though
everybody
knows
what
van
clupp
father
was
they
make
a
good
pretense
at
being
they
do
cram
their
low
connections
down
your
throat
as
wants
to
do
with
his
common
wife
they
ignore
all
their
vulgar
belongings
delightfully
they
been
cruelly
by
rippington
she
american
but
then
she
perfect
style
do
you
remember
that
big
home
at
the
van
clupp
when
they
had
a
band
to
play
in
the
and
everybody
was
deafened
by
the
noise
it
quite
too
ridiculous
lady
winsleigh
laughed
over
this
reminiscence
and
then
betook
herself
to
the
consideration
of
lunch
a
tasty
meal
which
both
she
and
marvelle
evidently
enjoyed
flavored
as
it
was
with
the
high
spice
of
scandal
concerning
their
most
immediate
and
mutual
friends
who
were
after
much
interesting
discussion
one
by
one
condemned
as
of
questionable
repute
and
uncertain
position
then
lady
winsleigh
summoned
her
maid
and
was
arrayed
in
while
marvelle
amused
herself
by
searching
the
columns
of
for
some
new
of
immorality
connected
with
the
royalty
or
nobility
of
england
and
at
three
precisely
the
two
ladies
drove
off
together
in
an
elegant
victoria
drawn
by
a
dashing
pair
of
greys
with
a
respectably
apoplectic
coachman
on
the
box
supported
by
the
stately
briggs
in
all
the
glory
of
the
and
gold
liveries
which
distinguished
the
winsleigh
equipage
by
her
desire
they
were
driven
straight
to
prince
gate
we
may
as
well
leave
our
cards
together
said
clara
with
a
malicious
little
smile
though
i
hope
to
goodness
the
creature
wo
be
at
home
was
a
very
mansion
refined
and
simple
in
outer
adornment
with
a
broad
entrance
deep
portico
and
lofty
windows
windows
which
fortunately
were
not
spoilt
by
gaudy
hangings
of
silk
or
satin
in
æsthetic
colors
the
blinds
were
white
and
what
could
be
seen
of
the
curtains
from
the
outside
suggested
the
richness
of
falling
velvets
and
tapestries
the
balconies
were
full
of
brilliant
flowers
shaded
by
quaint
awnings
of
oriental
pattern
thus
giving
the
place
an
air
of
pleasant
occupation
and
tasteful
elegance
lady
winsleigh
carriage
drew
up
at
the
door
and
briggs
descended
inquire
if
lady
is
at
home
said
his
mistress
and
if
not
leave
these
cards
briggs
received
the
scented
glossy
bits
of
pasteboard
in
his
hand
with
due
gravity
and
rang
the
bell
marked
visitors
in
his
usual
ponderous
manner
with
a
force
that
sent
it
clanging
loudly
through
the
corridors
of
the
stately
mansion
the
door
was
instantly
opened
by
a
respectable
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
gentle
kindly
face
who
was
dressed
plainly
in
black
and
who
eyed
the
gorgeous
briggs
with
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
smile
he
was
errington
butler
and
had
served
the
family
for
years
her
ladyship
is
driving
in
the
park
he
said
in
response
to
the
condescending
inquiries
of
briggs
she
left
the
house
about
half
an
hour
ago
briggs
thereupon
handed
in
the
cards
and
forthwith
reported
the
result
of
his
interview
to
lady
winsleigh
who
said
with
some
excitement
turn
into
the
park
and
drive
up
and
down
till
i
give
further
orders
briggs
mutely
touched
his
hat
mounted
the
box
and
the
carriage
rapidly
bowled
in
the
required
direction
while
lady
winsleigh
remarked
laughingly
to
marvelle
philip
is
sure
to
be
with
his
treasure
if
we
can
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
sitting
staring
at
everything
it
will
be
amusing
we
shall
then
know
what
to
expect
marvelle
said
nothing
though
she
too
was
more
or
less
curious
to
see
the
peasant
addition
to
the
circle
of
fashionable
society
and
when
they
entered
the
park
both
she
and
lady
winsleigh
kept
a
sharp
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
quiet
grey
and
silver
of
the
liveries
they
watched
however
in
vain
it
was
not
yet
the
hour
for
the
crowding
of
the
row
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
particular
equipage
they
were
so
desirous
to
meet
presently
lady
winsleigh
face
flushed
she
laughed
and
bade
her
coachman
come
to
a
halt
it
is
only
lennie
she
said
in
answer
to
marvelle
look
of
inquiry
i
speak
to
him
a
moment
and
she
beckoned
coquettishly
to
a
slight
slim
young
man
with
a
dark
moustache
and
rather
handsome
features
who
was
idling
along
on
the
footpath
apparently
absorbed
in
a
reverie
though
it
was
not
of
so
deep
a
character
that
he
failed
to
be
aware
of
her
ladyship
presence
in
fact
he
had
seen
her
as
soon
as
she
appeared
in
the
park
he
saw
everything
apparently
without
looking
he
had
lazily
drooping
eyes
but
a
swift
which
missed
no
detail
of
whatever
was
going
on
he
approached
now
with
an
excessively
languid
air
raising
his
hat
slowly
as
though
the
action
bored
him
how
do
mrs
marvelle
he
drawled
lazily
addressing
himself
first
to
the
elder
lady
who
responded
somewhat
curtly
then
leaning
his
arms
on
the
carriage
door
he
fixed
lady
winsleigh
with
a
sleepy
stare
of
admiration
and
how
is
our
clara
looking
charming
as
usual
by
jove
why
were
you
here
ten
minutes
ago
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
in
your
life
thought
the
whole
row
was
going
crazy
my
soul
why
what
happened
asked
lady
winsleigh
smiling
graciously
upon
him
anything
extraordinary
well
i
do
know
what
you
call
extraordinary
and
sir
francis
lennox
yawned
and
examined
the
handle
of
his
cane
attentively
i
suppose
if
helen
of
troy
came
driving
full
pelt
down
the
row
all
of
a
sudden
there
be
some
slight
sensation
dear
me
said
clara
winsleigh
pettishly
you
talk
in
enigmas
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
sir
francis
condescended
to
smile
do
be
waxy
clara
he
urged
i
mean
what
i
say
a
new
helen
appeared
here
and
instead
of
troy
being
on
fire
as
dante
rossetti
puts
it
the
row
was
in
a
burning
condition
of
excitement
fellows
on
horseback
galloped
the
whole
length
of
the
park
to
take
a
last
glimpse
of
her
her
carriage
dashed
off
to
richmond
after
taking
only
four
turns
she
is
simply
magnificent
who
is
she
and
in
spite
of
herself
lady
winsleigh
smile
vanished
and
her
lips
quivered
lady
answered
sir
francis
readily
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
world
i
should
say
phil
was
beside
her
he
looks
in
splendid
condition
and
that
meek
old
secretary
fellow
sat
opposite
neville
is
that
his
name
anyhow
they
seemed
as
jolly
as
pipers
as
for
that
woman
she
drive
everybody
out
of
their
wits
about
her
before
half
the
season
over
but
she
a
mere
peasant
said
marvelle
loftily
entirely
uneducated
a
low
common
creature
ah
indeed
and
sir
francis
again
yawned
extensively
well
i
know
anything
about
that
she
was
exquisitely
dressed
and
she
held
herself
like
a
queen
as
for
her
hair
i
never
saw
such
wonderful
hair
there
every
shade
of
gold
in
it
dyed
said
lady
winsleigh
with
a
sarcastic
little
laugh
she
been
in
paris
i
dare
say
a
good
has
done
it
for
her
there
artistically
this
time
sir
francis
smile
was
a
thoroughly
amused
one
commend
me
to
a
woman
for
spite
he
said
carelessly
but
i
not
presume
to
contradict
you
clara
you
know
best
i
dare
say
come
for
you
you
know
we
bound
for
the
theatre
together
marvelle
you
look
younger
than
ever
and
sir
francis
lennox
sauntered
easily
away
leaving
the
ladies
to
resume
their
journey
through
the
park
lady
winsleigh
looked
vexed
marvelle
bewildered
do
you
think
inquired
this
latter
she
can
really
be
so
wonderfully
lovely
no
i
do
answered
clara
snappishly
i
dare
say
she
a
plump
creature
with
a
high
color
men
like
fat
women
with
complexions
they
think
it
healthy
helen
of
troy
indeed
pooh
lennie
must
be
crazy
the
rest
of
their
drive
was
very
silent
they
were
both
absorbed
in
their
own
reflections
on
arriving
at
the
van
clupps
they
found
no
one
at
home
not
even
marcia
so
lady
winsleigh
drove
her
dearest
mimsey
back
to
her
own
house
in
kensington
and
there
left
her
with
many
expressions
of
tender
endearment
then
returning
home
proceeded
to
make
an
elaborate
and
brilliant
toilette
for
the
enchantment
and
edification
of
sir
francis
lennox
that
evening
she
dined
alone
and
was
ready
for
her
admirer
when
he
called
for
her
in
his
private
hansom
and
drove
away
with
him
to
the
theatre
where
she
was
the
cynosure
of
many
eyes
meanwhile
her
husband
lord
winsleigh
was
pressing
a
kiss
on
the
heated
forehead
of
an
excited
boy
who
plunging
about
in
his
little
bed
and
laughing
heartily
was
evidently
desirous
of
emulating
the
gambols
of
the
clown
who
had
delighted
him
that
afternoon
at
hengler
papa
could
you
stand
on
your
head
and
shake
hands
with
your
foot
demanded
this
young
rogue
confronting
his
father
with
towzled
curls
and
flushed
cheeks
lord
winsleigh
laughed
really
ernest
i
do
think
i
could
he
answered
have
you
talked
enough
about
the
circus
by
this
time
i
thought
you
were
ready
for
sleep
otherwise
i
should
not
have
come
up
to
say
ernest
studied
the
patient
kind
features
of
his
father
for
a
moment
and
then
slipped
penitently
under
the
bedclothes
settling
his
restless
young
head
determinedly
on
the
pillow
i
all
right
now
he
murmured
with
a
demure
dimpling
smile
then
with
a
tender
upward
twinkle
of
his
merry
blue
eyes
he
added
papa
dear
god
bless
you
a
sort
of
wistful
pathos
softened
the
grave
lines
of
lord
countenance
as
he
bent
once
more
over
the
little
bed
and
pressed
his
bearded
lips
lightly
on
the
boy
fresh
cheek
as
cool
and
soft
as
a
god
bless
you
little
man
he
answered
softly
and
there
was
a
slight
quiver
in
his
calm
voice
then
he
put
out
the
light
and
left
the
room
closing
the
door
after
him
with
careful
noiselessness
descending
the
broad
stairs
slowly
his
face
changed
from
its
late
look
of
tenderness
to
one
of
stern
and
patient
coldness
which
was
evidently
its
habitual
expression
he
addressed
himself
to
briggs
who
was
lounging
aimlessly
in
the
hall
her
ladyship
is
out
yes
my
lord
gone
to
the
theayter
with
sir
francis
lennox
lord
winsleigh
turned
upon
him
sharply
i
did
not
ask
you
briggs
she
had
gone
or
accompanied
her
have
the
goodness
to
answer
my
questions
simply
without
adding
useless
and
unnecessary
details
briggs
mouth
opened
a
little
in
amazement
at
his
master
peremptory
tone
but
he
answered
promptly
very
good
my
lord
lord
winsleigh
paused
a
moment
and
seemed
to
consider
then
he
said
see
that
her
ladyship
supper
is
prepared
in
the
she
will
most
probably
return
rather
late
should
she
inquire
for
me
say
i
am
at
the
carlton
again
briggs
responded
very
good
my
lord
and
like
an
exemplary
servant
as
he
was
he
lingered
about
the
passage
while
lord
winsleigh
entered
his
library
and
after
remaining
there
some
ten
minutes
or
so
came
out
again
in
hat
and
great
coat
the
officious
briggs
handed
him
his
cane
and
inquired
my
lord
thanks
no
i
will
walk
it
was
a
fine
moonlight
night
and
briggs
stood
for
some
minutes
on
the
steps
airing
his
shapely
calves
and
watching
the
tall
dignified
figure
of
his
master
walking
with
the
upright
stately
bearing
which
always
distinguished
him
in
the
direction
of
pall
mall
park
lane
was
full
of
crowding
carriages
with
twinkling
lights
all
bound
to
the
different
sources
of
pleasure
by
which
the
opening
of
the
season
is
distinguished
briggs
surveyed
the
scene
with
lofty
indifference
sniffed
the
cool
breeze
and
finding
it
somewhat
chilly
the
house
and
descended
to
the
servant
hall
here
all
the
domestics
of
the
winsleigh
household
were
seated
at
a
large
table
loaded
with
hot
and
savory
viands
a
table
presided
over
by
a
robust
and
perspiring
lady
with
a
very
red
face
and
sturdy
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
lor
mr
briggs
cried
this
personage
rising
respectfully
as
he
approached
late
you
are
wot
you
been
on
been
your
and
truffles
all
this
time
and
if
they
dried
up
my
fault
nor
that
of
the
hoven
which
is
as
good
a
hoven
as
you
can
wish
to
bake
in
she
paused
breathless
and
briggs
smiled
blandly
now
flopsie
he
said
in
a
tone
of
gentle
severity
excited
again
as
usual
it
bad
for
your
very
bad
the
chops
is
dried
your
course
is
plain
cook
some
more
not
that
i
am
enny
ways
particular
but
chippy
meat
is
bad
for
a
delicate
digestion
and
you
would
not
make
me
hill
my
flopsie
would
you
whereupon
he
seated
himself
and
looked
condescendingly
round
the
table
he
was
too
great
a
personage
to
be
familiar
with
such
inferior
creatures
as
housemaids
and
menials
of
that
class
he
was
only
on
intimate
terms
with
the
cook
flopper
or
as
he
called
her
flopsie
the
coachman
and
lady
winsleigh
own
maid
louise
rénaud
a
prim
frenchwoman
who
by
reason
of
her
nationality
was
called
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
kitchen
mamzelle
as
being
a
name
both
short
appropriate
and
convenient
on
careful
examination
the
turned
out
satisfactorily
chippiness
was
an
epithet
that
could
not
justly
be
applied
to
them
and
briggs
began
to
eat
them
leisurely
flavoring
them
with
a
glass
or
two
of
fine
port
out
of
a
decanter
which
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
down
from
the
sideboard
i
late
he
then
graciously
explained
not
that
i
was
detained
in
enny
way
by
the
people
upstairs
the
gay
clara
went
out
early
but
i
was
absorbed
in
the
evenin
papers
winsleigh
forgot
to
ask
me
for
them
but
he
see
them
at
his
club
he
gone
there
now

i

with

party
grinned
the
fat
flopsie
as
she
held
a
large
piece
of
bacon
dipped
in
vinegar
on
her
fork
preparatory
to
swallowing
it
with
a
gulp
briggs
nodded
gravely
the
same
not
a
fine

all
you

no
leg

speak
of
and
therefore
no

shrieked
with
laughter
till
she
had
a
stitch
in
her
side
and
was
compelled
to
restrain
her
mirth
lor

briggs
she
gasped
wiping
the
moisture
from
her
eyes

regular

to

returned
briggs
with
due
dignity
i
will
not
deny
that
there
may
be
wot
is
called
in
my
natur
and
is
wot

louise
rénaud
looked
across
at
him
her
prim
cruel
mouth
hardened
into
a
tight
line
to
she
said
that
is
what
we
call
yes
i
comprehend
miladi

one
but
one
must
be
a
very
good
jewel
to
always
yes
yes
not
a
sham
and
she
nodded
a
great
many
times
and
ate
her
salad
very
fast
briggs
surveyed
her
with
much
complacency
you
are
a
talented
woman
mamzelle
he
said
very
talented
i
admire
your
ways
i
really
do
mamzelle
smiled
with
a
gratified
air
and
briggs
settled
his
wig
eyeing
her
anew
with
fresh
interest
a
witness
you
would
be
in
a
divorce
case
he
continued
enthusiastically
you
be
in
your
helement
i
should
i
should
indeed
exclaimed
mamzelle
with
sudden
excitement
then
as
suddenly
growing
calm
she
made
a
rapid
gesture
with
her
hands
but
there
will
be
no
divorce
milord
winsleigh
is
a
fool
briggs
appeared
doubtful
about
this
and
meditated
for
a
long
time
over
his
third
glass
of
port
with
the
profound
gravity
of
a
philosopher
no
mamzelle
he
said
at
last
when
he
rose
from
the
table
to
return
to
his
duties
upstairs
no
there
i
must
differ
from
you
i
am
a
close
observer
wotever
winsleigh
faults
and
i
do
not
deny
that
they
are
many
he
is
a
gentleman
that
i
admit
and
with
respect
for
you
mamzelle
i
can
assure
you
he
no
fool
and
with
these
words
briggs
betook
himself
to
the
library
to
arrange
the
and
put
the
room
in
order
for
his
master
return
and
as
he
did
so
he
paused
to
look
at
a
fine
photograph
of
lady
winsleigh
that
stood
on
the
oak
escritoire
opposite
her
husband
no
he
muttered
to
himself
wotever
he
thinks
of
some
he
ai
blind
nor
deaf
that
certain
and
i
stake
my
character
and
purfessional
reputation
on
it
wotever
he
is
he
no
fool
for
once
in
his
life
briggs
was
right
he
was
generally
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
both
persons
and
things
but
it
so
happened
on
this
particular
occasion
that
he
had
formed
a
perfectly
correct
judgment
chapter

could
you
not
drink

gaze
like
wine

in
its
splendor
swoon
into
the
silence
languidly
as

dante
rossetti
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
thelma
lady
sat
at
breakfast
with
her
husband
in
their
fragrant
with
flowers
and
melodious
with
the
low
piping
of
a
tame
thrush
in
a
wild
gilded
cage
who
had
the
sweet
habit
of
warbling
his
strophes
to
himself
very
softly
now
and
then
before
venturing
to
give
them
utterance
a
feathered
poet
he
was
and
an
exceeding
favorite
with
his
fair
mistress
who
occasionally
leaned
back
in
her
low
chair
to
look
at
him
and
murmur
an
encouraging
sweet
sweet
which
caused
the
speckled
plumage
on
his
plump
breast
to
ruffle
up
with
suppressed
emotion
and
gratitude
philip
was
pretending
to
read
the
but
the
huge
printed
sheet
had
not
the
faintest
interest
for
him
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
top
of
its
columns
to
the
golden
gleam
of
his
wife
hair
brightened
just
then
by
the
sunlight
streaming
through
the
window
and
finally
he
threw
it
down
beside
him
with
a
laugh
there
no
news
he
declared
there
never
any
news
thelma
smiled
and
her
eyes
sparkled
no
she
half
inquired
then
taking
her
husband
cup
from
his
hand
to
it
with
coffee
she
added
but
i
think
you
do
not
give
yourself
time
to
find
the
news
philip
you
will
never
read
the
papers
more
than
five
minutes
my
dear
girl
said
philip
gaily
i
am
more
conscientious
than
you
are
at
any
rate
for
you
never
read
them
at
all
ah
but
you
must
remember
she
returned
gravely
that
is
because
i
do
not
understand
them
i
am
not
clever
they
seem
to
me
to
be
all
about
such
dull
things
unless
there
is
some
horrible
murder
or
cruelty
or
accident
and
i
would
rather
not
hear
of
these
i
do
prefer
books
always
because
the
books
last
and
news
is
never
certain
it
may
not
even
be
true
her
husband
looked
at
her
fondly
his
thoughts
were
evidently
very
far
away
from
newspapers
and
their
contents
as
she
met
his
gaze
the
rich
color
flushed
her
soft
cheeks
and
her
eyes
drooped
shyly
under
their
long
lashes
love
with
her
had
not
yet
proved
an
illusion
a
bright
toy
to
be
snatched
hastily
and
played
with
for
a
brief
while
and
then
thrown
aside
as
broken
and
worthless
it
seemed
to
her
a
most
marvellous
and
splendid
gift
of
god
increasing
each
day
in
worth
and
beauty
widening
upon
her
soul
and
dazzling
her
life
in
ever
new
and
expanding
circles
of
glory
she
felt
as
if
she
could
never
sufficiently
understand
it
the
passionate
adoration
philip
lavished
upon
her
filled
her
with
a
sort
of
innocent
wonder
and
gratitude
while
her
own
overpowering
love
and
worship
of
him
sometimes
startled
her
by
its
force
into
a
sweet
shame
and
hesitating
fear
to
her
mind
he
was
all
that
was
great
strong
noble
and
beautiful
he
was
her
master
her
king
and
she
loved
to
pay
him
homage
by
her
exquisite
humility
clinging
tenderness
and
complete
contented
submission
she
was
neither
weak
nor
timid
her
character
moulded
on
grand
and
simple
lines
of
duty
saw
the
laws
of
nature
in
their
true
light
and
accepted
them
without
question
it
seemed
to
her
quite
clear
that
man
was
the
superior
woman
the
inferior
creature
and
she
could
not
understand
the
possibility
of
any
wife
not
rendering
instant
and
implicit
obedience
to
her
husband
even
in
trifles
since
her
no
dark
cloud
had
crossed
her
heaven
of
happiness
though
she
had
been
a
little
confused
and
bewildered
at
first
by
the
wealth
and
dainty
luxury
with
which
sir
philip
had
delighted
to
surround
her
she
had
been
married
quietly
at
christiania
arrayed
in
one
of
her
own
simple
white
gowns
with
no
ornament
save
a
cluster
of
pale
the
gift
of
lorimer
the
ceremony
was
witnessed
by
her
father
and
errington
friends
and
when
it
was
concluded
they
had
all
gone
on
their
several
ways
old
güldmar
for
a
toss
on
the
bay
of
biscay
the
yacht
with
lorimer
macfarlane
and
duprèz
on
board
back
to
england
where
these
gentlemen
had
separated
to
their
respective
homes
while
errington
with
his
beautiful
bride
and
britta
in
demure
and
delighted
attendance
on
her
went
straight
to
copenhagen
from
there
they
travelled
to
hamburg
and
through
germany
to
the
schwarzwald
where
they
spent
their
honeymoon
at
a
quiet
little
hotel
in
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
days
of
delicious
dreaming
were
these
days
of
roaming
on
the
emerald
green
turf
under
the
stately
and
odorous
pines
listening
to
the
dash
of
the
waterfalls
or
watching
the
crimson
sunset
burning
redly
through
the
darkness
of
the
branches
and
in
the
moonlit
evenings
sitting
under
the
trees
to
hear
the
entrancing
music
of
a
hungarian
which
played
divine
and
voluptuous
melodies
of
the
land
lieder
and
walzer
that
swung
the
heart
away
on
a
golden
thread
of
sound
to
a
paradise
too
sweet
to
name
days
of
high
ecstacy
and
painfully
passionate
joy
when
love
love
palpitated
in
the
air
and
struggled
for
utterance
in
the
jubilant
throats
of
birds
and
whispered
wild
suggestions
in
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
there
were
times
when
thelma
lost
and
amazed
and
overcome
by
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
the
nectar
held
to
her
innocent
lips
by
a
smiling
and
eros
would
wonder
vaguely
whether
she
lived
indeed
or
whether
she
were
not
dreaming
some
gorgeous
dream
too
brilliant
to
last
and
even
when
her
husband
arms
most
surely
embraced
her
and
her
husband
kiss
met
hers
in
all
the
rapture
of
victorious
tenderness
she
would
often
question
herself
as
to
whether
she
were
worthy
of
such
perfect
happiness
and
she
would
pray
in
the
depths
of
her
pure
heart
to
be
made
more
deserving
of
this
great
and
wonderful
gift
of
love
this
supreme
joy
almost
too
vast
for
her
comprehension
on
the
other
hand
errington
passion
for
his
wife
was
equally
absorbing
she
had
become
the
very
of
his
existence
his
eyes
delighted
in
her
beauty
but
more
than
this
he
revelled
in
and
reverenced
the
parity
and
exquisite
refinement
of
her
soul
life
assumed
for
him
a
new
form
studied
by
the
light
of
straightforward
simplicity
and
intelligence
it
was
no
longer
as
he
had
once
been
inclined
to
think
a
mere
empty
routine
it
was
a
treasure
of
inestimable
value
fraught
with
divine
meanings
gradually
the
touch
of
modern
cynicism
that
had
at
one
time
threatened
to
spoil
his
nature
dropped
away
from
him
like
the
husk
from
an
ear
of
corn
the
world
arrayed
itself
in
bright
and
varying
colors
there
was
good
nay
there
was
glory
in
everything
with
these
ideas
and
the
healthy
satisfaction
they
engendered
his
heart
grew
light
and
joyous
his
eyes
more
lustrous
his
step
gay
and
elastic
and
his
whole
appearance
was
that
of
man
at
his
best
man
as
god
most
surely
meant
him
to
be
not
a
rebellious
sneering
wretch
ready
to
scoff
at
the
very
sunlight
but
a
being
both
brave
and
intelligent
strong
and
equally
balanced
in
temperament
and
not
only
contented
but
absolutely
glad
to
be
alive
glad
to
feel
the
blood
flowing
through
the
veins
glad
and
grateful
for
the
gifts
of
breathing
and
sight
as
each
day
passed
the
more
close
and
perfect
grew
the
sympathies
of
husband
and
wife
they
were
like
two
notes
of
a
perfect
chord
sounding
together
in
sweetest
harmony
naturally
much
of
this
easy
and
mutual
blending
of
character
and
disposition
arose
from
thelma
own
gracious
and
graceful
submissiveness
submissiveness
which
far
from
humiliating
her
actually
placed
her
though
she
knew
it
not
on
a
throne
of
almost
royal
power
before
which
sir
philip
was
content
to
kneel
an
ardent
worshipper
of
her
womanly
sweetness
always
without
question
or
demur
she
obeyed
his
wishes
implicitly
though
as
has
been
before
mentioned
she
was
at
first
a
little
overpowered
and
startled
by
the
evidences
of
his
wealth
and
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
all
the
luxuries
and
gifts
he
heaped
upon
her
britta
worldly
prognostications
had
come
true
the
simple
gowns
her
mistress
had
worn
at
the
altenfjord
were
soon
discarded
for
more
costly
apparel
though
sir
philip
had
an
affection
for
his
wife
norwegian
costumes
and
in
his
heart
thought
they
were
as
pretty
if
not
prettier
than
the
most
perfect
triumphs
of
a
parisian
but
in
the
social
world
fashion
the
capricious
deity
must
be
followed
if
not
wholly
yet
in
part
and
so
thelma
straight
plain
garments
were
laid
carefully
by
as
souvenirs
of
the
old
days
and
were
replaced
by
toilettes
of
the
most
exquisite
description
some
simple
some
costly
and
it
was
difficult
to
say
in
which
of
them
the
lovely
wearer
looked
her
best
she
herself
was
indifferent
in
the
matter
she
dressed
to
please
philip
if
he
was
satisfied
she
was
happy
she
sought
nothing
further
it
was
britta
whose
merry
eyes
sparkled
with
pride
and
admiration
when
she
saw
her
fröken
arrayed
in
gleaming
silk
or
sweeping
velvets
with
the
shine
of
rare
jewels
in
her
rippling
hair
it
was
britta
who
took
care
of
all
the
dainty
trifles
that
gradually
accumulated
on
thelma
dressing
table
in
fact
britta
had
become
a
very
important
personage
in
her
own
opinion
dressed
neatly
in
black
with
a
coquettish
muslin
apron
and
cap
becomingly
frilled
she
was
a
very
taking
little
maid
with
her
demure
rosy
face
and
rebellious
curls
though
very
different
to
the
usual
trained
spy
whose
officious
ministrations
are
deemed
so
necessary
by
ladies
of
position
whose
lofty
station
in
life
precludes
them
from
the
luxury
of
brushing
their
own
hair
britta
duties
were
slight
she
invented
most
of
them
yet
she
was
always
busy
sewing
dusting
packing
or
polishing
she
was
a
very
little
person
too
no
hint
was
lost
upon
her
and
she
held
her
own
wherever
she
went
with
her
bright
eyes
and
sharp
tongue
though
secretly
in
an
unbounded
state
of
astonishment
at
everything
new
she
saw
she
was
too
wise
to
allow
this
to
be
noticed
and
feigned
the
utmost
coolness
and
indifference
even
when
they
went
from
germany
to
paris
where
the
brilliancy
and
luxury
of
the
shops
almost
took
away
her
breath
for
sheer
wonderment
in
paris
thelma
wardrobe
was
completed
a
certain
madame
rosine
famous
for
artistic
arrangements
was
called
into
requisition
and
viewing
with
a
professional
eye
the
superb
figure
and
majestic
carriage
of
her
new
customer
rose
to
the
occasion
in
all
her
glory
and
resolved
that
miladi
dresses
should
be
the
wonder
and
envy
of
all
who
beheld
them
for
said
madame
with
a
grand
air
it
is
to
do
me
justice
that
form
so
magnificent
is
worth
draping
it
will
support
my
work
to
the
best
advantage
and
persons
without
figures
will
hasten
to
me
and
entreat
me
for
costumes
and
will
think
that
if
i
dress
them
i
can
make
them
look
as
well
as
miladi
and
they
will
pay
madame
shook
her
head
with
much
shrewdness
dieu
they
will
pay
and
that
they
still
look
frightful
will
not
be
my
fault
and
undoubtedly
madame
surpassed
her
usual
skill
in
all
she
did
for
thelma
she
took
such
pains
and
was
so
successful
in
all
her
designs
that
miladi
who
did
not
as
a
rule
show
more
than
a
very
ordinary
interest
in
her
toilette
found
it
impossible
not
to
admire
the
artistic
taste
harmonious
coloring
and
exquisite
fit
of
the
few
choice
gowns
supplied
to
her
from
the
maison
rosine
and
only
on
one
occasion
had
she
any
discussion
with
the
celebrated
modiste
this
was
when
madame
herself
with
much
pride
brought
home
an
evening
dress
of
the
very
palest
and
tenderest
silk
showered
with
pearls
and
embroidered
in
silver
a
perfect
of
the
art
the
skirt
with
its
billowy
train
and
peeping
folds
of
delicate
lace
pleased
thelma
but
she
could
not
understand
the
bodice
and
she
held
that
very
small
portion
of
the
costume
in
her
hand
with
an
air
of
doubt
and
wonderment
at
last
she
turned
her
grave
blue
eyes
inquiringly
on
madame
it
is
not
finished
she
asked
where
is
the
upper
part
of
it
and
the
sleeves
madame
rosine
gesticulated
with
her
hands
and
smiled
miladi
there
is
no
more
she
declared
miladi
will
perceive
it
is
for
the
evening
wear
it
is
it
is
to
show
to
everybody
miladi
most
beautiful
white
neck
and
arms
the
effect
will
be
ravishing
thelma
face
grew
suddenly
grave
almost
stern
you
must
be
very
wicked
she
said
severely
to
the
infinite
amazement
of
the
vivacious
rosine
you
think
i
would
show
myself
to
people
half
clothed
how
is
it
possible
i
would
not
so
disgrace
myself
it
would
bring
shame
to
my
husband
madame
was
almost
speechless
with
surprise
what
strange
lady
was
this
who
was
so
dazzlingly
beautiful
and
graceful
and
yet
so
ignorant
of
the
world
ways
she
stared
but
was
soon
on
the
defensive
miladi
is
in
a
little
error
she
said
rapidly
and
with
soft
persuasiveness
it
is
miladi
has
perhaps
lived
in
a
country
where
the
fashions
are
different
but
if
she
will
ask
the
most
amiable
sieur
she
will
find
that
her
dress
is
quite
in
keeping
with
a
pained
blush
crimsoned
thelma
fair
cheek
i
do
not
like
to
ask
my
husband
such
a
thing
she
said
slowly
but
i
must
for
i
could
not
wear
this
dress
without
shame
i
can
not
think
he
would
wish
me
to
appear
in
it
as
you
have
made
it
but
she
paused
and
taking
up
the
objectionable
bodice
she
added
gently
you
will
kindly
wait
here
madame
and
i
will
see
what
sir
philip
says
and
she
retired
leaving
the
in
a
state
of
much
astonishment
approaching
resentment
the
idea
was
outrageous
a
woman
with
such
divinely
fair
skin
a
woman
with
the
bosom
of
a
venus
and
arms
of
a
shape
to
make
sculptors
rave
and
yet
she
actually
wished
to
hide
these
beauties
from
the
public
gaze
it
was
ridiculous
utterly
ridiculous
and
madame
sat
fuming
impatiently
and
sniffing
the
air
in
wonder
and
scorn
meanwhile
thelma
with
flushing
cheeks
and
lowered
eyes
confided
her
difficulty
to
philip
who
surveyed
the
shocking
little
bodice
she
brought
for
his
inspection
with
a
gravely
amused
but
very
tender
smile
there
certainly
does
seem
much
of
it
does
there
darling
he
said
and
so
you
do
like
it
no
she
confessed
frankly
i
think
i
should
feel
quite
undressed
in
it
i
often
wear
just
a
little
opening
at
the
throat
but
this
still
philip
i
must
not
displease
you
and
i
will
always
wear
what
you
wish
even
if
it
is
uncomfortable
to
myself
look
here
my
pet
and
he
encircled
her
waist
fondly
with
his
arm
rosine
is
quite
right
the
thing
perfectly
fashionable
and
there
is
a
woman
in
society
who
would
be
perfectly
charmed
with
it
but
your
ideas
are
better
than
rosine
and
all
society
put
together
obey
your
own
womanly
instinct
thelma
but
what
do
wish
she
asked
earnestly
you
must
tell
me
it
is
to
please
you
that
i
live
he
kissed
her
you
want
me
to
issue
a
command
about
the
affair
he
said
half
laughingly
she
smiled
up
into
his
eyes
yes
and
i
will
obey
very
well
now
listen
and
he
held
her
by
both
hands
and
looked
with
sudden
gravity
into
her
sweet
face
thelma
my
wife
thus
sayeth
your
lord
and
master
despise
the
vulgar
indecencies
of
fashion
and
you
will
gratify
me
more
than
words
can
say
keep
your
pure
and
beautiful
self
sacred
from
the
profaning
gaze
of
the
multitude
sacred
to
me
and
my
love
for
you
and
i
shall
be
the
proudest
man
living
finally
and
he
smiled
again
give
rosine
back
this
effort
at
a
bodice
and
tell
her
to
make
something
more
in
keeping
with
the
laws
of
health
and
modesty
and
thelma
one
more
kiss
you
are
a
darling
she
laughed
softly
and
left
him
returning
at
once
to
the
irate
dressmaker
who
waited
for
her
i
am
sorry
she
said
very
sweetly
to
have
called
you
wicked
you
see
i
did
not
understand
but
though
this
style
of
dress
is
fashionable
i
do
not
wish
to
wear
it
so
you
will
please
make
me
another
bodice
with
a
small
open
square
at
the
throat
and
and
you
will
lose
nothing
at
all
for
i
shall
pay
you
for
this
one
just
the
same
and
you
must
quite
pardon
me
for
my
mistake
and
hasty
words
maladi
manner
was
so
gracious
and
winning
that
madame
rosine
found
it
impossible
not
to
smile
in
a
soothed
and
mollified
way
and
though
she
deeply
regretted
that
so
beautiful
a
neck
and
arms
were
not
to
be
exposed
to
public
criticism
she
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
and
took
away
the
offending
bodice
replacing
it
in
a
couple
of
days
by
one
much
prettier
and
more
becoming
by
reason
of
its
perfect
modesty
on
leaving
paris
sir
philip
had
taken
his
wife
straight
home
to
his
fine
old
manor
in
warwickshire
thelma
delight
in
her
new
abode
was
unbounded
the
stately
oaks
that
surrounded
it
the
the
conservatories
the
grand
rooms
with
their
fine
tapestries
oak
furniture
and
rare
pictures
the
splendid
library
the
long
lofty
furnished
and
decorated
after
the
style
of
louis
quinze
all
filled
her
with
a
tender
pride
and
wistful
admiration
this
was
philip
home
and
she
was
here
to
make
it
bright
and
glad
for
him
she
could
imagine
no
fairer
fate
the
old
servants
of
the
place
welcomed
their
new
mistress
with
marked
respect
and
evident
astonishment
at
her
beauty
though
when
they
knew
her
better
they
marvelled
still
more
at
her
exceeding
gentleness
and
courtesy
the
housekeeper
a
stately
dame
who
had
served
the
former
lady
errington
declared
she
was
an
angel
while
the
butler
swore
profoundly
that
he
knew
what
a
queen
was
like
at
last
the
whole
household
was
pervaded
with
an
affectionate
eagerness
to
please
her
though
perhaps
the
one
most
dazzled
by
her
entrancing
smile
and
sweet
consideration
for
his
comfort
was
edward
neville
sir
philip
private
secretary
and
librarian
a
meek
man
of
some
five
and
forty
years
old
whose
stooping
shoulders
grizzled
hair
and
weak
eyes
gave
him
an
appearance
of
much
greater
age
thelma
was
particularly
kind
to
neville
having
heard
his
history
from
her
husband
it
was
brief
and
sad
he
had
married
a
pretty
young
girl
whom
he
had
found
earning
a
bare
subsistence
as
a
singer
in
provincial
loving
her
he
had
pitied
her
unprotected
state
and
had
rescued
her
from
the
life
she
led
but
after
six
months
of
comparative
happiness
she
had
suddenly
deserted
him
leaving
no
clue
as
to
where
or
why
she
had
gone
his
grief
for
her
loss
weighed
heavily
upon
his
mind
he
brooded
incessantly
upon
it
and
though
his
profession
was
that
of
a
music
master
and
organist
he
grew
so
abstracted
and
inattentive
to
the
claims
of
the
few
pupils
he
had
that
they
fell
away
from
him
one
by
one
and
after
a
bit
he
lost
his
post
as
organist
to
the
village
church
as
well
this
smote
him
deeply
for
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
and
was
moreover
a
fine
player
and
it
was
at
this
stage
of
his
misfortunes
that
he
met
by
chance
philip
just
then
was
almost
his
father
and
mother
had
died
suddenly
within
a
week
of
one
another
and
he
finding
the
blank
desolation
of
his
home
unbearable
was
anxious
to
travel
abroad
for
a
time
so
soon
as
he
could
find
some
responsible
person
in
whose
hands
to
leave
the
charge
of
the
manor
with
its
invaluable
books
and
pictures
during
his
absence
hearing
neville
history
through
a
mutual
friend
he
decided
with
his
usual
characteristic
impulse
that
here
was
the
very
man
for
him
a
gentleman
by
birth
rumored
to
be
an
excellent
scholar
and
he
at
once
offered
him
the
post
he
had
in
view
that
of
private
secretary
at
a
salary
of
pounds
per
annum
the
astonished
neville
could
not
at
first
believe
in
his
good
fortune
and
began
to
stammer
forth
his
gratitude
with
trembling
lips
and
moistening
eyes
but
errington
cut
him
short
by
declaring
the
whole
thing
settled
and
desiring
him
to
enter
on
his
duties
at
once
he
was
forthwith
installed
in
his
position
a
highly
enviable
one
for
a
man
of
his
dreamy
and
meditative
turn
of
mind
to
him
literature
and
music
were
precious
as
air
and
light
he
handled
the
rare
volumes
on
the
errington
with
lingering
tenderness
and
often
pored
over
some
difficult
manuscript
or
dusty
folio
till
long
past
midnight
almost
forgetful
of
his
griefs
in
the
enchantment
thus
engendered
nor
did
he
lack
his
supreme
comforter
music
there
was
a
fine
organ
at
the
lower
end
of
the
long
library
and
seated
at
his
beloved
instrument
he
wiled
away
many
an
hour
steeping
his
soul
in
the
divine
and
solemn
melodies
of
palestrina
and
pergolesi
till
the
cruel
sorrow
that
had
darkened
his
life
seemed
nothing
but
a
bad
dream
and
the
face
of
his
wife
as
he
had
first
known
it
fair
trustful
and
plaintive
floated
before
his
eyes
unchanged
and
arousing
in
him
the
old
foolish
throbbing
emotions
of
rapture
and
passion
that
had
gladdened
the
bygone
days
he
never
lost
the
hope
of
meeting
her
again
and
from
time
to
time
he
renewed
his
search
for
her
though
all
uselessly
he
studied
the
daily
papers
with
an
almost
morbid
anxiety
lest
he
should
see
the
notice
of
her
death
and
he
would
even
await
each
post
with
a
heart
beating
more
rapidly
than
usual
in
case
there
should
be
some
letter
from
her
imploring
forgiveness
explaining
everything
and
summoning
him
once
more
to
her
side
he
found
a
true
and
keenly
sympathizing
friend
in
sir
philip
to
whom
he
became
profoundly
attached
to
satisfy
his
wishes
to
forward
his
interests
to
attend
to
his
affairs
with
punctilious
exactitude
all
this
gave
neville
the
supremest
happiness
he
felt
some
slight
doubt
and
anxiety
when
he
first
received
the
sudden
announcement
of
his
patron
marriage
but
all
forebodings
as
to
the
character
and
disposition
of
the
new
lady
fled
like
mist
before
sunshine
when
he
saw
thelma
fair
face
and
felt
her
friendly
every
morning
on
her
way
to
the
she
would
look
in
at
the
door
of
his
little
study
which
adjoined
the
library
and
he
learned
to
watch
for
the
first
glimmer
of
her
dress
and
to
listen
for
her
bright
good
morning
mr
neville
with
a
sensation
of
the
keenest
pleasure
it
was
a
sort
of
benediction
on
the
whole
day
a
proud
man
was
he
when
she
asked
him
to
give
her
lessons
on
the
organ
and
never
did
he
forget
the
first
time
he
heard
her
sing
he
was
playing
an
exquisite
ave
maria
by
stradella
and
she
standing
by
her
husband
side
was
listening
when
she
suddenly
exclaimed
why
we
used
to
sing
that
at
arles
and
her
rich
round
voice
pealed
forth
clear
solemn
and
sweet
following
with
pure
steadiness
the
sustained
notes
of
the
organ
neville
heart
thrilled
he
heard
her
with
a
sort
of
breathless
wonder
and
rapture
and
when
she
ceased
it
seemed
as
though
heaven
had
closed
upon
him
one
can
not
praise
such
a
voice
as
that
he
said
it
would
be
a
kind
of
sacrilege
it
is
divine
after
this
many
were
the
pleasant
musical
evenings
they
all
passed
together
in
the
grand
old
library
and
as
had
so
indignantly
told
her
husband
no
visitors
were
invited
to
the
manor
during
that
winter
errington
was
perfectly
happy
he
wanted
no
one
but
his
wife
and
the
idea
of
entertaining
a
party
of
guests
who
would
most
certainly
interfere
with
his
domestic
enjoyment
seemed
almost
abhorrent
to
him
the
called
but
missed
seeing
thelma
for
during
the
daytime
she
was
always
out
with
her
husband
taking
long
walks
and
rambling
excursions
to
the
different
places
hallowed
by
presence
and
when
she
instructed
by
sir
philip
called
on
the
they
also
seemed
to
be
never
at
home
and
so
as
yet
she
had
made
no
acquaintances
and
now
that
she
had
been
married
eight
months
and
had
come
to
london
the
same
old
story
repeated
itself
people
called
on
her
in
the
afternoon
just
at
the
time
when
she
went
out
driving
when
she
returned
their
visits
she
in
her
turn
found
them
absent
she
did
not
as
yet
understand
the
mystery
of
having
a
day
on
which
to
receive
visitors
in
shoals
a
day
on
which
to
drink
unlimited
tea
talk
platitudes
and
utterly
bored
and
exhausted
at
the
end
thereof
in
fact
she
did
not
see
the
necessity
of
knowing
many
people
her
husband
was
for
her
to
be
in
his
society
was
all
she
cared
for
she
left
her
card
at
different
houses
because
he
told
her
to
do
so
but
this
social
duty
amused
her
immensely
it
is
like
a
game
she
declared
laughing
some
one
comes
and
leaves
these
little
cards
which
explain
who
are
on
then
i
go
and
leave
little
cards
and
yours
explaining
who
are
on
that
some
one
and
we
keep
on
doing
this
yet
we
never
see
each
other
by
any
chance
it
is
so
droll
errington
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
explain
what
was
really
the
fact
namely
that
none
of
the
ladies
who
had
left
cards
on
his
wife
had
given
her
the
option
of
their
at
home
day
on
which
to
call
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
her
what
he
knew
very
well
that
his
set
both
in
county
and
town
had
resolved
to
snub
her
in
every
petty
fashion
they
could
devise
that
he
had
already
received
several
invitations
which
as
they
did
not
include
her
he
had
left
unanswered
and
that
the
only
house
to
which
she
had
as
yet
been
really
asked
in
proper
form
was
that
of
lady
winsleigh
he
was
more
amused
than
vexed
at
the
resolute
stand
made
by
the
leaders
of
society
against
her
knowing
as
he
did
most
thoroughly
how
she
must
conquer
them
all
in
the
end
she
had
been
seen
nowhere
as
yet
but
in
the
park
and
philip
had
good
reason
to
be
contented
with
the
excitement
her
presence
had
created
there
but
he
was
a
little
astonished
at
lady
winsleigh
being
the
first
to
extend
a
formal
welcome
to
his
unknown
bride
her
behavior
seemed
to
him
a
little
suspicious
for
he
certainly
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
she
had
at
one
time
been
most
violently
and
recklessly
in
love
with
him
he
recollected
one
or
two
most
painful
scenes
he
had
had
with
her
in
which
he
had
endeavored
to
recall
her
to
a
sense
of
the
duty
she
owed
to
her
husband
and
his
face
often
flushed
with
vexation
when
he
thought
of
her
wild
and
wicked
abandonment
of
despair
her
tears
her
passion
and
distracted
dishonoring
words
yet
she
was
the
very
woman
who
now
came
forward
in
the
very
front
of
society
to
receive
his
wife
he
could
not
quite
understand
it
after
all
he
was
a
man
and
the
sundry
artful
tricks
and
wiles
of
fashionable
ladies
were
naturally
beyond
him
thelma
had
never
met
lady
winsleigh
not
even
for
a
passing
glance
in
the
park
and
when
she
received
the
invitation
for
the
grand
reception
at
winsleigh
house
she
accepted
it
because
her
husband
wished
her
so
to
do
not
that
she
herself
anticipated
any
particular
pleasure
from
it
when
the
day
came
round
at
last
she
scarcely
thought
of
it
till
at
the
close
of
their
pleasant
breakfast
described
at
the
commencement
of
this
chapter
philip
suddenly
said
thelma
i
have
sent
to
the
bank
for
the
errington
diamonds
they
be
here
presently
i
want
you
to
wear
them
thelma
looked
puzzled
and
inquiring
what
is
it
that
we
do
i
forget
oh
now
i
know
it
is
to
go
to
lady
winsleigh
what
will
it
be
like
philip
well
there
be
heaps
of
people
all
cramming
and
crowding
up
the
stairs
and
down
them
again
you
see
all
those
women
who
have
called
on
you
and
you
be
introduced
to
them
i
dare
say
there
be
some
bad
music
and
an
indigestible
supper
and
and
that
all
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
reproachfully
i
can
not
believe
you
my
naughty
boy
she
said
rising
from
her
seat
and
kneeling
beside
him
with
arms
round
his
neck
and
soft
eyes
gazing
lovingly
into
his
you
are
nearly
as
bad
as
that
very
bad
lorimer
who
will
always
see
strange
vexations
in
everything
i
am
quite
sure
lady
winsleigh
will
not
have
crowds
up
and
down
her
stairs
that
would
be
bad
taste
and
if
she
has
music
it
will
be
good
and
she
would
not
give
her
friends
a
supper
to
make
them
philip
did
not
answer
he
was
studying
every
delicate
tint
in
his
dazzling
complexion
and
seemed
absorbed
wear
that
one
gown
you
got
from
worth
he
said
abruptly
i
like
it
it
suits
you
of
course
i
will
wear
it
if
you
wish
she
answered
laughing
still
but
why
what
does
it
matter
you
want
me
to
be
something
very
splendid
in
dress
philip
drew
a
deep
breath
i
want
you
to
eclipse
every
woman
in
the
room
he
said
with
remarkable
emphasis
she
grew
rather
pensive
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
pleasant
she
said
gravely
besides
it
is
impossible
and
it
would
be
wrong
to
wish
me
to
make
every
one
else
dissatisfied
with
themselves
that
is
not
like
you
my
philip
he
touched
with
tender
fingers
the
great
glistening
coil
of
hair
that
was
twisted
up
at
the
top
of
her
graceful
head
ah
darling
you
do
know
what
a
world
it
is
and
what
very
queer
people
there
are
in
it
never
mind
do
bother
yourself
about
it
you
have
a
good
view
of
society
tonight
and
you
shall
tell
me
afterwards
how
you
like
it
i
shall
be
curious
to
know
what
you
think
of
lady
winsleigh
she
is
beautiful
is
she
not
well
she
is
considered
so
by
most
of
her
acquaintances
and
by
herself
he
returned
with
a
smile
i
do
like
to
see
very
pretty
faces
said
thelma
warmly
it
is
as
if
one
looked
at
pictures
since
i
have
been
in
london
i
have
seen
so
many
of
them
it
is
quite
pleasant
yet
none
of
these
lovely
ladies
seem
to
me
as
if
they
were
really
happy
or
strong
in
health
half
of
them
have
got
nervous
diseases
and
all
sorts
of
things
wrong
with
them
from
tea
and
tight
lacing
replied
errington
and
the
few
who
tolerably
healthy
are
too
bouncing
by
half
going
in
for
hunting
and
amusements
till
they
grow
blowsy
and
fat
and
coarse
as
or
grooms
they
can
never
hit
the
well
and
he
rose
from
the
i
go
and
see
neville
and
attend
to
business
we
drive
out
this
afternoon
for
some
fresh
air
and
afterwards
you
must
rest
my
pet
for
you
find
an
more
tiring
than
climbing
a
mountain
in
norway
he
kissed
and
left
her
to
her
usual
occupations
of
which
she
had
many
for
she
had
taken
great
pains
to
learn
all
the
details
of
the
work
in
the
errington
establishment
in
fact
she
went
every
morning
to
the
little
room
where
mistress
parton
the
housekeeper
received
her
with
much
respect
and
affection
and
duly
instructed
her
on
every
point
of
the
domestic
management
and
daily
expenditure
so
that
she
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
everything
that
went
on
she
had
very
orderly
quiet
ways
of
her
own
and
though
thoughtful
for
the
comfort
and
of
the
lowest
servant
in
her
household
she
very
firmly
checked
all
extravagance
and
waste
yet
in
such
a
gentle
unobtrusive
manner
that
her
control
was
scarcely
felt
though
her
husband
at
once
recognized
it
in
the
gradually
decreasing
weekly
expenses
while
to
all
appearance
things
were
the
same
as
ever
she
had
plenty
of
clear
good
common
sense
she
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
waste
her
husband
wealth
simply
because
it
was
abundant
so
that
under
her
mild
sway
sir
philip
found
himself
getting
richer
without
any
trouble
on
his
own
part
his
house
assumed
an
air
of
lighter
and
more
tasteful
elegance
flowers
always
arranged
by
thelma
herself
adorned
the
rooms
birds
filled
the
great
conservatory
with
their
delicious
warblings
and
gradually
that
strange
fairy
sweet
fabric
known
as
home
rose
smilingly
around
him
formerly
he
had
much
disliked
his
stately
town
mansion
he
had
thought
it
dull
and
cold
almost
gloomy
but
now
he
considered
it
charming
and
wondered
he
had
missed
so
many
of
its
good
points
before
and
when
the
evening
for
lady
winsleigh
crush
came
he
looked
regretfully
round
the
lovely
luxurious
with
its
bright
fire
deep
easy
chairs
books
and
grand
piano
and
wished
he
and
his
wife
could
remain
at
home
in
peace
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
there
was
no
hurry
he
had
not
the
least
intention
of
arriving
at
winsleigh
house
too
early
he
knew
what
the
effect
of
entrance
would
be
and
he
smiled
as
he
thought
of
it
he
was
waiting
for
her
now
he
himself
was
ready
in
full
evening
dress
and
remarkably
handsome
he
looked
he
walked
up
and
down
restlessly
for
a
minute
or
so
then
taking
up
a
volume
of
keats
he
threw
himself
into
an
easy
chair
and
soon
became
absorbed
his
eyes
were
still
on
the
printed
page
when
a
light
touch
on
his
shoulder
startled
him
a
soft
voice
inquired
philip
do
i
please
you
he
sprang
up
and
faced
her
but
for
a
moment
could
not
speak
the
perfection
of
her
beauty
had
never
ceased
to
arouse
his
wonder
and
passionate
admiration
but
on
this
night
as
she
stood
before
him
arrayed
in
a
simple
trailing
robe
of
velvet
with
his
family
diamonds
flashing
in
a
tiara
of
light
on
her
hair
glistening
against
the
whiteness
of
her
throat
and
rounded
arms
she
looked
angelically
lovely
so
radiant
so
royal
and
withal
so
innocently
happy
that
wistfully
gazing
at
her
and
thinking
of
the
social
clique
into
which
she
was
about
to
make
her
entry
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
he
was
not
wrong
to
take
so
pure
and
fair
a
creature
among
the
false
glitter
and
reckless
hypocrisy
of
modern
fashion
and
folly
and
so
he
stood
silent
till
thelma
grew
anxious
ah
you
are
not
satisfied
she
said
plaintively
i
am
not
as
you
wish
there
is
something
wrong
he
drew
her
closely
into
his
arms
kissing
her
with
an
almost
pathetic
tenderness
thelma
my
love
my
sweet
one
and
his
strong
voice
trembled
you
do
not
know
how
should
you
what
i
think
of
you
satisfied
pleased
good
heavens
what
little
words
those
are
to
express
my
feelings
i
can
tell
you
how
you
look
for
nothing
can
ever
make
vain
you
are
beautiful
you
are
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
have
ever
seen
and
you
look
your
very
best
tonight
but
you
are
more
than
beautiful
you
are
good
and
pure
and
true
while
society
is
but
why
should
i
destroy
your
illusions
only
my
wife
we
have
been
all
in
all
to
each
other
and
now
i
have
a
foolish
feeling
as
if
things
were
going
to
be
different
as
if
we
should
not
be
so
much
together
and
i
wish
i
wish
to
god
i
could
keep
you
all
to
myself
without
anybody
interference
she
looked
at
him
in
wonder
though
she
smiled
but
you
have
changed
my
boy
since
the
morning
she
said
then
you
did
wish
me
to
be
particular
in
dress
and
to
wear
your
jewels
for
this
lady
winsleigh
now
your
eyes
are
sad
and
you
seem
as
if
you
would
rather
not
go
at
all
well
is
it
not
easy
to
remain
at
home
i
will
take
off
these
fine
things
and
we
will
sit
together
and
read
shall
it
be
so
he
laughed
i
believe
you
would
do
it
if
i
asked
you
he
said
but
of
course
i
am
quite
happy
alone
with
you
i
care
nothing
for
this
party
what
is
it
to
me
if
you
do
not
wish
to
go
he
kissed
her
again
thelma
do
spoil
me
too
much
if
you
let
me
have
my
own
way
to
such
an
extent
who
knows
what
an
awful
domestic
tyrant
i
may
become
no
dear
we
must
go
tonight
there
no
help
for
it
you
see
we
accepted
the
invitation
and
it
no
use
being
churlish
besides
after
all
he
gazed
at
her
admiringly
i
want
them
to
see
my
norwegian
rose
come
along
the
carriage
is
waiting
they
passed
out
into
the
hall
where
britta
was
in
attendance
with
a
long
cloak
of
plush
lined
with
white
fur
in
which
she
tenderly
enveloped
her
beloved
fröken
her
rosy
face
beaming
with
affectionate
adoration
as
she
glanced
from
the
fair
head
down
to
the
point
of
a
small
shoe
that
peeped
beneath
the
edge
of
the
rich
sheeny
white
robe
and
saw
that
nothing
was
lacking
to
the
most
perfect
toilette
that
ever
woman
wore
britta
said
thelma
kindly
you
must
not
sit
up
for
me
you
will
be
tired
britta
smiled
it
was
evident
she
meant
to
outwatch
the
stars
if
necessary
rather
than
allow
her
mistress
to
be
unattended
on
her
return
but
she
said
nothing
she
waited
at
the
door
while
philip
assisted
his
wife
into
the
carriage
and
still
stood
musingly
under
the
wide
portico
after
they
had
driven
away
had
you
better
come
in
miss
britta
said
the
butler
respectfully
he
had
a
great
regard
for
her
ladyship
little
maid
britta
recalled
to
herself
started
turned
and
the
hall
there
will
be
many
fine
folks
there
i
suppose
she
asked
the
butler
rubbed
his
nose
perplexedly
fine
folks
at
winsleigh
house
well
as
far
as
clothes
go
i
dare
say
there
will
but
there
be
no
one
like
her
ladyship
no
one
and
he
shook
his
grey
head
emphatically
of
course
not
said
britta
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
defiance
we
know
that
very
well
morris
there
no
one
like
her
ladyship
anywhere
in
the
wide
world
but
i
tell
you
what
i
think
a
great
many
people
will
be
jealous
of
her
morris
smiled
you
may
take
your
oath
of
that
miss
britta
he
said
with
placid
conviction
jealous
jealous
is
the
word
for
it
why
and
he
surveyed
britta
youthful
countenance
with
fatherly
interest
you
only
a
child
as
it
were
and
you
do
know
the
world
much
now
i
been
five
and
twenty
years
in
this
family
and
i
knew
sir
mother
the
lady
he
named
his
yacht
after
her
ah
she
was
a
sweet
creature
she
came
from
austria
and
she
was
as
dark
as
her
present
ladyship
is
fair
wherever
she
went
i
tell
you
the
women
were
ready
to
cry
for
spite
and
envy
of
her
good
looks
and
they
would
say
anything
against
her
they
could
invent
that
the
way
they
go
on
sometimes
in
society
you
know
as
bad
as
in
bosekop
murmured
britta
more
to
herself
than
to
him
only
london
is
a
larger
place
then
raising
her
voice
again
she
said
perhaps
there
will
be
some
people
wicked
enough
to
hate
her
ladyship
morris
i
should
wonder
said
morris
philosophically
i
should
wonder
at
all
there
a
deal
of
hate
about
one
way
or
another
and
if
a
lady
is
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
cuts
out
everybody
wherever
she
goes
why
you
ca
expect
the
other
ladies
to
be
very
fond
of
her
is
in
human
nature
at
least
not
in
feminine
human
nature
men
do
care
much
about
their
looks
one
way
or
the
other
unless
they
young
chaps
then
one
has
a
little
patience
with
them
and
they
come
all
right
but
britta
had
become
meditative
again
she
went
slowly
up
into
her
mistress
room
and
began
arranging
the
few
trifles
that
had
been
left
in
disorder
just
fancy
she
said
to
herself
some
one
may
hate
the
fröken
even
in
london
just
as
they
hated
her
in
bosekop
because
she
is
so
unlike
everybody
else
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
and
shall
soon
find
out
any
wickedness
against
her
my
beautiful
dear
darling
i
believe
the
world
is
a
cruel
place
after
all
but
sha
be
made
unhappy
in
it
if
i
can
help
it
and
with
this
emphatic
declaration
she
kissed
a
little
shoe
of
that
she
was
just
putting
by
and
smoothing
her
curls
went
down
to
her
supper
chapter
xx
such
people
there
are
living
and
flourishing
in
the
world
faithless
hopeless
charityless
let
us
have
at
them
dear
friends
with
might
and
main
thackeray
who
can
adequately
describe
the
thrilling
excitement
attending
an
aristocratic
crush
an
extensive
at
home
that
scene
of
bewildering
confusion
which
might
be
appropriately
set
forth
to
the
minds
of
the
vulgar
in
the
ditty
such
a
i
never
did
see
who
can
paint
in
sufficiently
brilliant
colors
the
mere
of
a
house
thus
distinguished
by
this
strange
festivity
in
which
there
is
no
actual
pleasure
this
crowding
of
carriages
this
shouting
of
small
boys
and
policemen
who
can
in
words
delineate
the
various
phases
of
lofty
indignation
and
offense
on
the
countenances
of
pompous
coachmen
forced
into
contention
with
vulgar
but
cabbys
for
right
of
way
who
can
sufficiently
set
forth
the
splendors
of
a
striped
awning
avenue
lined
on
both
sides
with
a
collection
of
tropical
verdure
hired
for
the
occasion
at
so
much
per
dozen
pots
and
illuminated
with
chinese
lanterns
talk
of
orange
groves
in
italy
and
the
languid
light
of
a
southern
moon
what
are
they
compared
to
the
marvels
of
striped
awning
mere
trees
mere
moonlight
poor
products
of
nature
do
not
excite
either
wonder
or
envy
but
strange
to
say
an
awning
avenue
invariably
does
as
soon
as
it
is
erected
in
all
its
bland
suggestiveness
no
matter
at
what
house
a
small
crowd
of
and
nursemaids
collect
to
stare
at
it
and
when
tired
of
staring
pass
and
repass
under
it
with
peculiar
satisfaction
the
beggar
starving
for
a
crust
lingers
doubtfully
near
it
and
ventures
to
inquire
of
the
whether
it
is
a
wedding
or
a
party
and
if
awning
avenue
means
matrimony
the
beggar
waits
to
see
the
guests
come
out
if
on
the
contrary
it
stands
for
some
evening
festivity
he
goes
resolving
to
return
at
the
appointed
hour
and
try
if
he
can
not
persuade
one
swell
at
least
to
throw
him
a
penny
for
his
supper
yes
a
great
many
people
endure
sharp
twinges
of
discontent
at
the
sight
of
awning
avenue
people
who
ca
afford
to
give
parties
and
who
wish
they
could
pretty
sweet
girls
who
never
go
to
a
dance
in
their
lives
and
long
with
all
their
innocent
hearts
for
a
glimpse
just
glimpse
of
what
seems
to
them
inexhaustible
delight
lonely
folks
who
imagine
in
their
simplicity
that
all
who
are
privileged
to
pass
between
the
lines
of
hired
tropical
foliage
aforementioned
must
perforce
be
the
best
and
most
united
of
friends
hungry
men
and
women
who
picture
with
watering
mouths
the
that
lies
the
awning
laden
with
good
things
of
the
very
names
of
which
they
are
hopelessly
ignorant
while
now
and
then
a
stern
thinker
or
two
may
stalk
by
and
metaphorically
shake
his
fist
at
all
the
waste
extravagance
useless
luxury
humbug
and
hypocrisy
awning
avenue
usually
symbolizes
and
may
mutter
in
his
beard
like
an
tragedian
a
time
come
yes
sir
thinker
it
will
most
undoubtedly
it
but
not
through
you
not
through
any
mere
human
agency
modern
society
contains
within
itself
the
seed
of
its
own
destruction
the
most
utter
nihilist
that
ever
swore
deadly
oath
need
but
contain
his
soul
in
patience
and
allow
the
seed
to
ripen
for
god
justice
is
as
a
circle
that
slowly
surrounds
an
evil
and
as
slowly
closes
on
it
with
crushing
and
resistless
force
and
feverish
fretting
humanity
however
nobly
inspired
can
do
nothing
either
to
hasten
or
retard
the
round
perfect
absolute
and
divine
law
so
let
the
babes
of
the
world
play
on
and
let
us
not
frighten
them
with
stories
of
earthquakes
they
are
miserable
enough
as
it
is
believe
it
their
toys
are
so
brittle
and
snap
in
their
feeble
hands
so
easily
that
one
is
inclined
to
pity
them
and
awning
avenue
with
its
borrowed
verdure
and
artificial
light
is
frequently
erected
for
the
use
of
some
of
the
most
wretched
among
the
children
of
the
earth
children
who
have
trifled
with
and
lost
everything
love
honor
hope
and
faith
and
who
are
travelling
rapidly
to
the
grave
with
no
consolation
save
a
few
handfuls
of
base
coin
which
they
must
perforce
leave
behind
them
at
the
last
so
it
may
be
that
the
crippled
outside
winsleigh
house
is
a
very
great
deal
happier
than
the
master
of
that
stately
mansion
he
has
a
new
broom
and
master
ernest
winsleigh
has
given
him
two
oranges
and
a
rather
bulky
stick
of
sugar
candy
he
is
a
of
ernest
that
bright
handsome
boy
considers
it
a
jolly
shame
to
have
only
one
leg
and
has
said
so
with
much
emphasis
and
though
the
little
sweeper
himself
has
never
regarded
his
affliction
quite
in
that
light
he
is
exceedingly
grateful
for
the
young
gentleman
patronage
and
sympathy
thus
frankly
expressed
and
on
this
particular
night
of
the
grand
reception
he
stands
leaning
on
his
broom
and
munching
his
candy
a
delighted
spectator
of
the
scene
in
park
lane
the
splendid
equipages
the
prancing
horses
the
glittering
liveries
the
excited
cabmen
the
magnificent
toilettes
of
the
ladies
the
solemn
and
resigned
deportment
of
the
gentlemen
and
he
envies
none
of
them
not
he
why
should
he
his
oranges
are
in
his
pocket
untouched
as
yet
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
crowding
guests
at
the
winsleigh
shall
find
anything
there
to
yield
them
such
entire
enjoyment
as
he
will
presently
take
in
his
humble
yet
refreshing
desert
and
he
is
pleased
as
a
child
at
a
pantomime
the
winsleigh
at
home
is
a
show
that
amuses
him
and
he
makes
sundry
remarks
on
and
in
a
meditative
he
peeps
up
awning
avenue
heedless
of
the
severe
eye
of
the
policeman
on
guard
he
sweeps
the
edge
of
the
crimson
felt
tenderly
with
his
broom
and
if
he
has
a
desire
ungratified
it
is
that
he
might
take
a
peep
just
for
a
minute
inside
the
front
door
and
see
how
they
all
it
and
how
they
it
well
not
very
hilariously
if
one
may
judge
by
the
aspect
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
hall
and
on
the
stairs
gentlemen
of
serious
demeanor
who
are
leaning
as
though
exhausted
against
the
banisters
with
a
universal
air
of
profound
weariness
and
dissatisfaction
some
of
these
are
young
fledglings
of
manhood
callow
birds
who
though
by
no
means
innocent
are
more
or
less
inexperienced
and
who
have
fluttered
hither
to
the
snare
of
lady
winsleigh
at
home
half
expecting
to
be
allowed
to
make
love
to
their
hostess
and
so
have
something
to
boast
of
afterwards
others
are
of
the
complacent
type
who
though
infinitely
bored
have
condescended
to
look
in
for
ten
minutes
or
so
to
see
if
there
are
any
pretty
women
worth
the
honor
of
their
criticism
others
again
and
these
are
the
most
unfortunate
are
the
nobodies
or
husbands
fathers
and
brothers
of
beauties
whom
they
have
dutifully
escorted
to
the
scene
of
triumph
in
which
they
unlucky
wights
are
certainly
not
expected
to
share
a
little
desultory
conversation
goes
on
among
these
conversation
mingled
with
much
dreary
yawning
a
trained
is
shaking
forth
chromatic
roulades
and
trills
in
the
great
above
there
is
an
incessant
stream
of
people
coming
and
going
there
is
the
rustle
of
silk
and
satin
perfume
shaken
out
of
lace
kerchiefs
and
bouquets
oppresses
the
warm
air
the
heat
is
excessive
and
there
is
a
monotonous
hum
of
voices
only
broken
at
rare
intervals
by
the
society
laugh
that
unmeaning
giggle
on
the
part
of
the
women
that
strained
ha
ha
ha
on
the
part
of
the
men
which
is
but
the
faint
ghostly
echo
of
the
farewell
voice
of
true
mirth
presently
out
of
the
ladies
come
two
fascinating
figures
the
one
plump
and
matronly
with
grey
hair
and
a
capacious
neck
glittering
with
diamonds
the
other
a
slim
girl
in
pale
pink
with
dark
eyes
and
a
ravishing
complexion
for
whom
the
lazy
gentlemen
on
the
stairs
make
immediate
and
respectful
room
how
d
do
van
clupp
says
one
of
the
loungers
glad
to
see
you
miss
marcia
says
another
a
young
man
with
a
large
gardenia
in
his
and
a
glass
in
his
eye
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
miss
marcia
stops
and
regards
him
with
a
surprised
smile
she
is
very
pretty
is
marcia
bewitchingly
pretty
and
she
has
an
air
of
demure
grace
and
modesty
about
her
that
is
perfectly
charming
why
oh
why
does
she
not
remain
in
that
attitude
of
questioning
silence
but
she
speaks
and
the
charm
is
broken
waal
now
dew
tell
she
exclaims
i
thought
yew
were
in
is
ma
would
yew
have
concluded
to
find
lord
algy
here
this
is
lovely
if
i
known
were
coming
i
have
stopped
at
home
yes
i
would
that
so
and
she
nods
her
little
head
crowned
with
its
glossy
braids
of
chestnut
hair
in
a
very
coquettish
manner
while
her
mother
persistently
beaming
a
stereotyped
company
smile
on
all
around
her
begins
to
ascend
the
stairs
beckoning
her
daughter
to
follow
marcia
does
so
and
lord
algernon
masherville
escorts
her
you
you
did
mean
that
he
stammers
rather
feebly
you
you
mind
my
being
here
do
you
i
i
glad
to
see
you
again
you
know
and
er
all
that
sort
of
thing
marcia
darts
a
keen
glance
at
him
the
glance
of
an
observant
magpie
oh
yes
i
dare
say
she
remarks
with
airy
scorn
to
believe
waal
did
yew
have
a
good
time
in
is
fairly
so
answers
lord
masherville
indifferently
i
only
came
back
two
days
ago
lady
winsleigh
met
me
by
chance
at
the
theatre
and
asked
me
to
look
in
for
fun
she
said
have
you
any
idea
what
she
meant
of
course
says
the
fair
new
yorker
with
a
little
nasal
laugh
do
know
we
all
here
to
see
the
fisherwoman
from
the
wilds
of
norway
the
creature
sir
philip
errington
married
last
year
i
conclude
she
give
us
fits
all
round
do
yew
lord
masherville
at
this
appears
to
hesitate
his
troubles
him
and
he
fidgets
with
its
black
string
he
is
not
intellectual
he
is
the
most
vacillating
most
meek
and
timid
of
mortals
but
he
is
a
gentleman
in
his
own
poor
fashion
and
has
a
sort
of
fluttering
chivalry
about
him
which
though
feeble
is
better
than
none
i
really
can
not
tell
you
miss
marcia
he
replies
almost
nervously
i
hear
at
the
club
that
that
lady
is
a
great
beauty
dew
tell
shrieks
marcia
with
a
burst
of
laughter
is
she
really
though
but
i
guess
her
looks
wo
mend
her
grammar
any
way
he
makes
no
reply
as
by
this
time
they
have
reached
the
crowded
where
lady
winsleigh
radiant
in
ruby
velvet
and
stands
receiving
her
guests
with
a
cool
smile
and
nod
for
mere
acquaintances
and
a
meaning
flash
of
her
dark
eyes
for
her
intimates
and
a
general
air
of
haughty
insolence
and
perfect
pervading
her
from
head
to
foot
close
to
her
is
her
husband
grave
courtly
and
kind
to
all
comers
and
fulfilling
his
duty
as
host
to
perfection
still
closer
is
sir
francis
lennox
who
in
the
pauses
of
the
incoming
tide
of
guests
finds
occasion
to
whisper
trifling
nothings
in
her
tiny
white
ear
and
even
once
ventures
to
arrange
more
tastefully
a
falling
cluster
of
pale
roses
that
rests
lightly
on
the
brief
called
by
courtesy
a
sleeve
which
keeps
her
ladyship
bodice
in
place
is
here
too
in
all
her
glory
her
countenance
and
small
nose
together
beam
with
satisfaction
her
voluminous
train
of
black
satin
showered
with
jet
gets
in
way
her
ample
bosom
heaves
like
the
billowy
sea
somewhat
above
the
boundary
line
of
transparent
lace
that
would
fain
restrain
it
but
in
this
particular
she
is
prudence
itself
compared
with
her
hostess
whose
charms
are
exhibited
with
the
unblushing
frankness
of
a
and
whose
example
is
followed
it
must
be
confessed
by
most
of
the
women
in
the
room
is
here
oh
yes
after
some
little
trouble
we
discover
him
squeezed
against
the
wall
and
barricaded
by
the
grand
piano
in
company
with
a
large
album
over
which
he
pores
feigning
an
almost
morbid
interest
in
the
portraits
of
persons
he
has
never
seen
and
never
will
see
beside
him
is
a
melancholy
short
man
with
long
hair
and
pimples
who
surveys
the
increasing
crowd
in
the
room
with
an
aspect
that
is
almost
tragic
once
or
twice
he
eyes
marvelle
dubiously
as
though
he
would
speak
and
finally
he
speak
tapping
that
gentleman
on
the
arm
with
an
energy
that
is
somewhat
startling
it
is
to
blay
i
am
here
he
announces
to
blay
ze
biano
i
am
great
artist
he
rolls
his
eyes
wildly
and
with
a
sort
of
forced
calmness
proceeds
to
enumerate
on
his
fingers
baris
vienna
rome
berlin
betersburg
all
know
me
all
resbect
me
see
and
he
holds
out
his
in
which
there
is
a
miniature
red
ribbon
from
ze
emberor
kaiser
wilhelm
he
exhibits
a
ring
on
his
little
finger
from
ze
tsar
another
rapid
movement
and
a
pompous
gold
watch
is
thrust
before
the
bewildered
gaze
of
his
listener
from
my
bubils
in
baris
i
am
bianist
i
am
here
to
blay
and
raking
his
fingers
through
his
long
locks
he
stares
defiantly
around
him
is
a
little
frightened
this
is
an
eccentric
personage
he
must
be
soothed
evidently
he
must
be
soothed
yes
yes
i
quite
understand
he
says
nodding
persuasively
at
the
excited
genius
you
are
here
to
play
exactly
yes
yes
we
shall
all
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
presently
delightful
i
sure
you
are
the
celebrated
herr
machtenklinken
adds
the
pianist
haughtily
ze
celebrated
machtenklinken
yes
oh
er
yes
and
marvelle
grapples
desperately
with
this
terrible
name
oh
er
yes
i
er
know
you
by
reputation
herr
er
machten
oh
er
yes
pray
excuse
me
for
a
moment
and
thankfully
catching
the
commanding
eye
of
his
wife
he
scrambles
hastily
away
from
the
piano
and
joins
her
she
is
talking
to
the
van
clupps
and
she
wants
him
to
take
away
van
clupp
a
old
man
for
a
little
conversation
in
order
that
she
may
be
free
to
talk
over
certain
naughty
bits
of
scandal
with
van
clupp
and
marcia
there
is
no
place
to
sit
down
in
all
the
grand
extent
of
the
winsleigh
puffy
old
dowagers
occupy
the
sofas
ottomans
and
chairs
and
the
largest
and
most
brilliant
portion
of
the
assemblage
are
standing
grinning
into
each
other
faces
with
praiseworthy
and
polite
pertinacity
and
talking
as
rapidly
as
though
their
lives
depended
on
how
many
words
they
could
utter
within
the
space
of
two
minutes
van
clupp
and
marcia
make
their
way
slowly
through
the
gabbling
pushing
smirking
crowd
till
they
form
a
part
of
the
little
immediately
round
lady
winsleigh
to
whom
at
the
first
opportunity
marvelle
whispers
have
they
come
the
modern
paris
and
the
new
helen
laughs
lady
clara
with
a
shrug
of
her
snowy
shoulders
no
not
yet
perhaps
they
wo
turn
up
at
all
marcia
dear
you
look
charming
where
is
lord
algy
i
guess
he
not
a
thousand
miles
away
returns
marcia
with
a
knowing
twinkle
of
her
dark
eyes
he
hang
round
here
presently
why
there
lorimer
worrying
in
at
the
doorway
worrying
in
is
scarcely
the
term
to
apply
to
the
polite
but
determined
manner
in
which
george
lorimer
coolly
elbows
a
passage
among
the
heaving
bare
shoulders
backs
fat
arms
and
long
trains
that
seriously
obstruct
his
passage
but
after
some
trouble
he
succeeds
in
his
efforts
to
reach
his
fair
hostess
who
receives
him
with
rather
a
supercilious
uplifting
of
her
delicate
eyebrows
dear
me
lorimer
you
are
quite
a
stranger
she
observes
somewhat
satirically
we
thought
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
settle
in
norway
did
you
really
though
and
lorimer
smiles
languidly
i
wonder
at
that
for
you
knew
i
came
back
from
that
region
in
the
august
of
last
year
and
since
then
i
suppose
you
have
played
the
hermit
inquires
her
ladyship
indifferently
unfurling
her
fan
of
ostrich
feathers
and
waving
it
slowly
to
and
fro
by
no
means
i
went
off
to
scotland
with
a
friend
alec
macfarlane
and
had
some
excellent
shooting
then
as
i
never
permit
my
venerable
mamma
to
pass
the
winter
in
london
i
took
her
to
nice
from
which
delightful
spot
we
returned
three
weeks
ago
lady
winsleigh
laughs
i
did
not
ask
you
for
a
categorical
explanation
of
your
movements
lorimer
she
says
lightly
i
sure
i
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
he
bows
gravely
thanks
yes
strange
to
say
i
manage
to
extract
a
little
pleasure
here
and
there
out
of
the
universal
dryness
of
things
have
you
seen
your
friend
sir
philip
since
he
came
to
town
asks
in
her
stately
way
several
times
i
have
dined
with
him
and
lady
errington
frequently
i
understand
they
are
to
be
here
lady
winsleigh
fans
herself
a
little
more
rapidly
and
her
full
crimson
lips
tighten
into
a
thin
malicious
line
well
i
asked
them
of
course
as
a
matter
of
form
she
says
carelessly
but
i
shall
on
the
whole
be
rather
relieved
if
they
do
come
a
curious
amused
look
comes
over
lorimer
face
indeed
may
i
ask
why
i
should
think
the
reason
ought
to
be
perfectly
apparent
to
you
and
her
ladyship
eyes
flash
angrily
sir
philip
is
all
very
well
he
is
by
birth
a
gentleman
but
the
person
he
has
married
is
not
a
lady
and
it
is
an
exceedingly
unpleasant
duty
for
me
to
have
to
receive
her
a
feint
tinge
of
color
flushes
lorimer
brow
i
think
he
says
slowly
i
think
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
lady
winsleigh
i
believe
here
he
pauses
and
fixes
him
with
a
stony
stare
are
we
to
understand
that
she
is
educated
she
inquires
freezingly
positively
lorimer
laughs
not
according
to
the
standard
of
modern
fashionable
requirements
he
replies
marvelle
sniffs
the
air
portentously
lady
clara
curls
her
lip
at
that
moment
everybody
makes
respectful
way
for
one
of
the
most
important
guests
of
the
evening
a
man
of
careless
attire
rough
hair
fine
features
and
keen
mischievous
eyes
a
man
of
whom
many
stand
in
wholesome
awe
beaufort
lovelace
or
as
he
is
commonly
called
beau
lovelace
a
brilliant
novelist
critic
and
pitiless
satirist
for
him
society
is
a
game
a
gay
which
he
spins
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
for
his
own
private
amusement
once
a
scribbler
in
an
attic
subsisting
bravely
on
bread
and
cheese
and
hope
he
now
lords
it
more
than
half
the
year
in
a
palace
of
beauty
on
the
lago
di
como
and
he
is
precisely
the
same
person
who
was
formerly
disdained
and
flouted
by
fair
ladies
because
his
clothes
were
poor
and
shabby
yet
for
whom
they
now
practise
all
the
arts
known
to
their
sex
in
fruitless
endeavors
to
charm
and
conciliate
him
for
he
laughs
at
them
and
their
pretty
ways
and
his
laughter
is
merciless
his
arrowy
glance
discovers
the
poudre
de
riz
on
their
blooming
cheeks
the
carmine
on
their
lips
and
the
kohl
on
their
eyelashes
he
knows
purchased
hair
from
the
natural
growth
and
he
has
a
cruel
eye
for
discerning
the
artificial
contour
of
a
figure
and
like
a
merry
satyr
dancing
in
a
legendary
forest
he
capers
and
gambols
in
the
vast
fields
of
humbug
all
forms
of
it
are
attacked
and
ridiculed
by
his
powerful
and
pungent
pen
he
is
a
sort
of
english
heine
gathering
in
rich
and
daily
harvests
from
the
crop
of
fools
and
as
he
in
all
the
wickedness
of
daring
and
superior
intellect
approaches
lady
winsleigh
draws
herself
up
with
the
conscious
air
of
a
beauty
who
knows
she
is
nearly
perfect
makes
a
faint
endeavor
to
settle
the
lace
more
modestly
over
her
rebellious
bosom
marcia
smiles
coquettishly
and
van
clupp
brings
her
diamond
pendant
value
a
thousand
guineas
more
prominently
forward
for
as
she
thinks
poor
ignorant
soul
wealth
always
impresses
these
literary
men
more
than
anything
in
one
swift
glance
beau
lovelace
observes
all
these
different
movements
and
the
inner
fountain
of
his
mirth
begins
to
bubble
what
fun
those
van
clupps
are
he
thinks
the
old
woman
got
a
diamond
plaster
on
her
neck
horrible
taste
she
anxious
to
show
how
much
she
worth
i
suppose
marvelle
wants
a
shawl
and
lady
clara
a
bodice
by
jove
what
sights
the
women
do
make
of
themselves
but
his
face
betrays
none
of
these
reflections
its
expression
is
one
of
polite
gravity
though
a
sudden
sweetness
smooths
it
as
he
shakes
hands
with
lord
winsleigh
and
lorimer
a
sweetness
that
shows
how
remarkably
handsome
beau
can
look
if
he
chooses
he
rests
one
hand
on
lorimer
shoulder
why
george
old
boy
i
thought
you
were
playing
the
dutiful
son
at
nice
do
tell
me
you
deserted
the
dear
old
lady
where
is
she
you
know
i
got
to
finish
that
argument
with
her
about
her
beloved
byron
lorimer
laughs
go
and
finish
it
when
you
like
beau
he
answers
my
mother
all
right
she
at
home
you
know
she
always
charmed
to
see
you
she
delighted
with
that
new
book
of
yours
is
she
she
finds
pleasure
in
trifles
then
oh
no
mr
lovelace
interrupts
lady
clara
with
a
winning
glance
you
must
not
run
yourself
down
the
book
is
exquisite
i
got
it
at
once
from
the
library
and
read
every
line
of
it
i
am
exceedingly
flattered
says
lovelace
with
a
grave
bow
though
there
is
a
little
twinkling
mockery
in
his
glance
when
a
lady
so
bewitching
condescends
to
read
what
i
have
written
how
can
i
express
my
emotion
the
press
is
unanimous
in
its
praise
of
you
remarks
lord
winsleigh
cordially
you
are
quite
the
lion
of
the
day
oh
quite
agrees
beau
laughing
and
do
i
not
roar
sweet
as
any
nightingale
but
i
say
where
the
new
beauty
i
really
do
not
know
to
whom
you
allude
lovelace
replies
lady
winsleigh
coldly
lorimer
smiles
and
is
silent
beau
looks
from
one
to
the
other
amusedly
perhaps
i
made
a
mistake
he
says
but
the
duke
of
roxwell
is
responsible
he
told
me
that
if
i
came
here
i
should
see
one
of
the
loveliest
women
living
lady
he
saw
her
in
the
park
i
think
gentleman
indicating
sir
francis
lennox
who
bites
his
moustache
vexedly
said
quite
openly
at
the
club
last
night
that
she
the
new
beauty
and
that
she
would
be
here
this
evening
lady
winsleigh
darts
a
side
glance
at
her
lennie
that
is
far
from
pleasant
really
it
perfectly
absurd
she
says
with
a
scornful
toss
of
her
head
we
shall
have
housemaids
and
accepted
as
the
rage
next
i
do
not
know
sir
philip
wife
in
the
least
i
hear
she
was
a
common
farmer
daughter
i
certainly
invited
her
out
of
charity
and
kindness
in
order
that
she
might
get
a
little
accustomed
to
society
for
of
course
poor
creature
entirely
ignorant
and
uneducated
as
she
is
everything
will
seem
strange
to
her
but
she
has
not
come
sir
philip
and
lady
announces
briggs
at
this
juncture
there
is
a
sudden
hush
a
movement
of
excitement
and
the
groups
near
the
door
fall
apart
staring
and
struck
momentarily
dumb
with
surprise
as
a
tall
radiant
figure
in
dazzling
white
with
diamonds
flashing
on
a
glittering
coil
of
gold
hair
and
wondrous
earnest
eyes
passes
through
their
midst
with
that
royal
free
step
and
composed
grace
of
bearing
that
might
distinguish
an
empress
of
many
nations
good
heavens
what
a
magnificent
woman
mutters
beau
lovelace
venus
realized
lady
winsleigh
turns
very
pale
she
trembles
and
can
scarcely
regain
her
usual
composure
as
sir
philip
with
a
proud
tenderness
lighting
up
the
depths
of
his
hazel
eyes
leads
this
vision
of
youth
and
perfect
loveliness
up
to
her
saying
simply
lady
winsleigh
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
my
wife
thelma
this
is
lady
winsleigh
there
is
a
strange
sensation
in
lady
winsleigh
throat
as
though
a
very
tight
string
were
suddenly
drawn
round
it
to
almost
strangling
point
and
it
is
certain
that
she
feels
as
though
she
must
scream
hit
somebody
with
her
fan
and
rush
from
the
room
in
an
undignified
rage
but
she
chokes
back
these
purely
feminine
emotions
she
smiles
and
extends
her
jewelled
hand
so
good
of
you
to
come
she
says
sweetly
i
have
been
longing
to
see
you
lady
errington
i
dare
say
you
know
your
husband
is
quite
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
and
a
langourous
glance
like
fire
seen
through
smoke
leaps
from
beneath
her
silky
eyelashes
at
sir
philip
but
he
sees
it
not
he
is
chatting
and
laughing
gaily
with
lorimer
and
beau
lovelace
indeed
yes
answers
thelma
in
that
soft
low
voice
of
hers
which
had
such
a
thrilling
richness
within
it
and
it
is
for
that
reason
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
it
is
always
pleasant
for
me
to
know
my
friends
here
she
raises
those
marvellous
innocent
eyes
of
hers
and
smiles
why
does
lady
winsleigh
shrink
from
that
frank
and
childlike
openness
of
regard
why
does
she
for
one
brief
moment
hate
herself
why
does
she
so
suddenly
feel
herself
to
be
vile
and
beneath
contempt
god
only
knows
but
the
first
genuine
blush
that
has
tinged
her
ladyship
cheek
for
many
a
long
day
suddenly
spreads
a
hot
and
embarrassing
tide
of
crimson
over
the
polished
pallor
of
her
satiny
skin
and
she
says
hurriedly
i
must
find
you
some
people
to
talk
to
this
is
my
dear
friend
i
am
sure
you
will
like
each
other
let
me
introduce
van
clupp
to
you
van
clupp
and
miss
van
clupp
the
ladies
bow
stiffly
while
thelma
responds
to
their
prim
salutation
with
easy
grace
sir
francis
lennox
continues
lady
winsleigh
and
there
is
something
like
a
sneer
in
her
smile
as
that
gentleman
makes
a
deep
and
courtly
reverence
with
an
unmistakable
look
of
admiration
in
his
sleepy
eyes
then
she
turns
to
lord
winsleigh
and
adds
in
a
casual
way
my
husband
lord
winsleigh
advances
rather
eagerly
there
is
a
charm
in
the
exquisite
nobility
of
thelma
face
that
touches
his
heart
and
appeals
to
the
chivalrous
and
poetical
part
of
his
nature
sir
philip
and
i
have
known
each
other
for
some
years
he
says
pressing
her
little
fair
hand
cordially
it
is
a
great
pleasure
for
me
to
see
you
lady
errington
i
realize
how
very
much
my
friend
deserves
to
be
congratulated
on
his
marriage
thelma
smiles
this
little
speech
pleases
her
but
she
does
not
accept
the
compliment
implied
to
herself
you
are
very
kind
lord
winsleigh
she
answers
i
am
glad
indeed
that
you
like
philip
i
do
think
with
you
that
he
deserves
every
one
good
wishes
it
is
my
great
desire
to
make
him
always
happy
a
brief
shadow
crosses
lord
winsleigh
thoughtful
brow
and
he
studies
her
sweet
eyes
attentively
is
she
sincere
does
she
mean
what
she
says
or
is
she
like
others
of
her
sex
merely
playing
a
graceful
part
a
slight
sigh
escapes
him
absolute
truth
innocent
love
and
stainless
purity
are
written
in
such
fair
clear
lines
on
that
perfect
countenance
that
the
mere
idea
of
questioning
her
sincerity
seems
a
sacrilege
your
desire
is
gratified
i
am
sure
he
returns
and
his
voice
is
somewhat
sad
i
never
saw
him
looking
so
well
he
seems
in
excellent
spirits
oh
for
that
and
she
laughs
he
is
a
very
boy
but
once
he
would
tell
me
very
dreadful
things
about
the
world
how
it
was
not
at
all
worth
living
in
but
i
do
think
he
must
have
been
lonely
for
he
is
very
pleased
with
everything
now
and
finds
no
fault
at
all
i
can
quite
understand
that
and
lord
winsleigh
smiles
though
that
shadow
of
pain
still
rests
on
his
brow
and
the
van
clupps
are
listening
to
the
conversation
with
straining
ears
what
strange
person
is
this
she
does
not
talk
bad
grammar
though
her
manner
of
expressing
herself
is
somewhat
quaint
and
foreign
but
she
is
babyish
perfectly
babyish
the
idea
of
any
woman
condescending
to
sing
the
praises
of
her
own
husband
in
public
absurd
deserves
good
wishes
pooh
her
great
desire
is
to
make
him
always
happy
what
utter
rubbish
and
he
is
a
boy
good
gracious
what
next
marcia
van
clupp
is
strongly
inclined
to
giggle
and
van
clupp
is
indignantly
conscious
that
the
errington
diamonds
far
surpass
her
own
both
for
size
and
lustre
at
that
moment
sir
philip
approaches
his
wife
with
george
lorimer
and
beau
lovelace
thelma
smile
at
lorimer
is
the
greeting
of
an
old
friend
a
glance
that
makes
his
heart
beat
a
little
quicker
than
usual
he
watches
her
as
she
turns
to
be
introduced
to
lovelace
while
miss
van
clupp
thinking
of
the
relentless
gift
of
satire
with
which
that
brilliant
writer
is
endowed
looks
out
for
some
fun
for
as
she
confides
in
a
low
tone
to
marvelle
she
never
know
how
to
talk
to
that
man
thelma
says
sir
philip
this
is
the
celebrated
author
beaufort
lovelace
you
have
often
heard
me
speak
of
him
she
extends
both
her
hands
and
her
eyes
deepen
and
flash
ah
you
are
one
of
those
great
men
whom
we
all
love
and
admire
she
says
with
direct
frankness
and
the
cynical
beau
who
has
never
yet
received
so
sincere
a
compliment
feels
himself
coloring
like
a
i
am
so
very
proud
to
meet
you
i
have
read
your
wonderful
book
and
it
made
me
glad
and
sorry
together
for
why
do
you
draw
a
noble
example
and
yet
say
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
impossible
to
follow
it
because
in
one
breath
you
inspire
us
to
be
good
and
yet
you
tell
us
we
shall
never
become
so
that
is
not
right
is
it
beau
meets
her
questioning
glance
with
a
grave
smile
it
is
most
likely
entirely
wrong
from
point
of
view
lady
errington
he
said
some
day
we
will
talk
over
the
matter
you
shall
show
me
the
error
of
my
ways
perhaps
you
will
put
life
and
the
troublesome
business
of
living
in
quite
a
new
light
for
me
you
see
we
novelists
have
an
unfortunate
trick
of
looking
at
the
worst
or
most
ludicrous
side
of
everything
we
ca
help
it
so
many
apparently
lofty
and
pathetic
tragedies
turn
out
on
close
examination
to
be
the
meanest
and
most
miserable
of
farces
it
no
good
making
them
out
to
be
grand
greek
poems
when
they
are
only
base
doggerel
rhymes
besides
it
the
fashion
nowadays
to
be
in
literature
to
pick
up
the
rags
of
life
and
sort
them
in
all
their
uncomeliness
before
the
morbid
eyes
of
the
public
what
the
use
of
spending
thought
and
care
on
the
manufacture
of
a
jewelled
diadem
and
offering
it
to
the
people
on
a
velvet
cushion
when
they
prefer
an
of
clothing
dried
bones
and
in
brief
what
would
it
avail
to
write
as
grandly
as
shakespeare
or
scott
when
society
clamors
for
zola
and
others
of
his
school
there
was
a
little
group
round
them
by
this
time
men
generally
collected
wherever
beau
lovelace
aired
his
opinions
and
a
double
attraction
drew
them
together
now
in
the
person
of
the
lovely
woman
to
whom
he
was
holding
forth
marcia
van
clupp
stared
mightily
surely
the
norwegian
peasant
would
not
understand
beau
similes
for
they
were
certainly
incomprehensible
to
marcia
as
for
his
last
remark
why
she
had
read
all
zola
novels
in
the
secrecy
of
her
own
room
and
had
gloated
over
them
no
words
could
describe
her
intense
admiration
of
books
that
were
so
indelicately
realistic
he
is
jealous
of
other
writers
i
suppose
she
thought
these
literary
people
hate
each
other
like
poison
meanwhile
thelma
blue
eyes
looked
puzzled
i
do
not
know
that
name
she
said
zola
what
is
he
he
can
not
be
great
shakespeare
i
know
he
is
the
glory
of
the
world
of
course
i
think
him
as
noble
as
homer
then
for
walter
scott
i
love
all
his
beautiful
stories
i
have
read
them
many
many
times
nearly
as
often
as
i
have
read
homer
and
the
norse
sagas
and
the
world
must
surely
love
such
writings
or
how
should
they
last
so
long
she
laughed
and
shook
her
bright
head
archly
point
du
tout
monsieur
les
divines
pensées
que
vous
avez
donné
au
monde
ne
sont
pas
des
beau
smiled
again
and
offered
her
his
arm
let
me
find
you
a
chair
he
said
it
will
be
rather
a
difficult
matter
still
i
can
but
try
you
will
be
fatigued
if
you
stand
too
long
and
he
moved
through
the
swaying
crowd
with
her
little
gloved
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
while
marcia
van
clupp
and
her
mother
exchanged
looks
of
wonder
and
dismay
the
fisherwoman
could
speak
french
moreover
she
could
speak
it
with
a
wonderfully
soft
and
perfect
accent
the
person
had
studied
homer
and
shakespeare
and
was
conversant
with
the
best
literature
and
bitterest
sting
of
all
the
peasant
could
give
every
woman
in
the
room
a
lesson
in
deportment
grace
and
perfect
taste
in
dress
every
costume
looked
tawdry
beside
her
richly
flowing
velvet
draperies
every
low
bodice
became
indecent
compared
with
the
modesty
of
that
small
square
opening
at
thelma
white
throat
an
opening
just
sufficient
to
display
her
collar
of
diamonds
and
every
figure
seemed
either
dumpy
and
awkward
too
big
or
too
fat
or
too
lean
and
too
lanky
when
brought
into
contrast
with
her
statuesque
outlines
the
die
was
cast
the
authority
of
beau
lovelace
was
nearly
supreme
in
fashionable
and
artistic
circles
and
from
the
moment
he
was
seen
devoting
his
attention
to
the
new
beauty
excited
whispers
began
to
flit
from
mouth
to
mouth
she
will
be
the
rage
this
season
we
must
ask
her
to
come
to
us
ask
lady
winsleigh
to
introduce
us
she
come
to
house
and
so
on
and
lady
winsleigh
was
neither
blind
nor
deaf
she
saw
and
heard
plainly
enough
that
her
reign
was
over
and
in
her
secret
soul
she
was
furious
the
common
farmer
daughter
was
neither
vulgar
nor
uneducated
and
she
was
surpassingly
lovely
even
lady
winsleigh
could
not
deny
so
plain
and
absolute
a
fact
but
her
ladyship
was
a
woman
of
the
world
and
she
perceived
at
once
that
thelma
was
not
philip
had
married
a
creature
with
the
bodily
loveliness
of
a
goddess
and
the
innocent
soul
of
a
child
and
it
was
just
that
pure
soul
looking
serenely
out
of
thelma
eyes
that
had
brought
the
blush
of
shame
to
clara
winsleigh
cheek
but
that
feeling
of
soon
passed
she
was
no
better
and
no
worse
than
other
women
of
her
set
she
thought
after
all
what
had
she
to
be
ashamed
of
nothing
except
except
perhaps
her
little
affair
with
lennie
a
new
emotion
now
stirred
her
blood
one
of
malice
and
hatred
mingled
with
a
sense
of
outraged
love
and
ungratified
passion
for
she
still
admired
philip
to
a
foolish
excess
her
dark
eyes
flashed
scornfully
as
she
noted
the
attitude
of
sir
francis
lennox
he
was
leaning
against
the
marble
stroking
his
moustache
with
one
hand
absorbed
in
watching
thelma
who
seated
in
an
easy
chair
which
beau
lovelace
had
found
for
her
was
talking
and
laughing
gaily
with
those
immediately
around
her
a
group
which
increased
in
size
every
moment
and
in
which
the
men
were
most
predominant
fool
muttered
lady
winsleigh
to
herself
apostrophizing
lennie
in
this
uncomplimentary
manner
fool
i
wonder
if
he
thinks
i
care
he
may
play
hired
lacquey
to
all
the
women
in
london
if
he
likes
he
looks
a
prig
compared
to
philip
and
her
gaze
wandered
philip
was
standing
by
his
wife
engaged
in
an
animated
conversation
with
lord
winsleigh
they
were
all
near
the
grand
piano
and
lady
clara
smoothing
her
vexed
brow
swept
her
ruby
velvets
gracefully
up
to
that
quarter
of
the
room
before
she
could
speak
the
celebrated
herr
machtenklinken
confronted
her
with
some
sternness
your
ladyshib
vill
do
me
ze
kindness
to
remember
he
said
loftily
zat
i
am

lady
winsleigh
raised
her
eyes
with
much
superciliousness
as
you
please
she
said
coolly
if
are
so
indifferent
to
your
advantages
then
all
i
can
say
is
so
am
i
you
are
perhaps
known
on
the
continent
herr
machtenklinken
but
not
here
and
i
think
you
ought
to
be
more
grateful
for
my
influence
so
saying
she
passed
on
leaving
the
luckless
pianist
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
indignation
in
himmel
he
gasped
in
a
sort
of
infuriated
sotto
voce
ze
emberor
himself
would
not
have
speak
to
me
so
i
come
here
as
a
favor
her
ladyshib
do
not
offer

one
ach
ze

not
for
such
beoble
i
shall
brefer
to
blay
to
bigs
zere
is
no
art
in
zis
country
and
he
began
to
make
his
way
out
of
the
room
when
he
was
overtaken
by
beau
lovelace
who
had
followed
him
in
haste
where
are
you
off
to
hermann
he
asked
we
want
you
to
play
there
is
a
lady
here
who
heard
you
in
paris
quite
recently
she
admires
you
immensely
wo
you
come
and
be
introduced
to
her
herr
machtenklinken
paused
and
a
smile
softened
his
hitherto
angry
countenance
you
are
fery
goot
lofelace
he
remarked
and
i
would
do
moch
for
but
her
ladyshib
understands
me
not
she
has
offend
me
it
is
better
i
should
take
my
leave
oh
bother
her
ladyship
said
beau
lightly
come
along
and
give
us
something
in
your
best
style
so
saying
he
led
the
artist
back
to
the
piano
where
he
was
introduced
to
thelma
who
gave
him
so
sweet
a
smile
that
he
was
fairly
dazzled
it
is
you
who
play
schumann
so
beautifully
she
said
my
husband
and
i
heard
you
at
one
of
lamoureux
concerts
in
paris
i
fear
and
she
looked
wistfully
at
him
that
you
would
think
it
very
rude
and
selfish
of
me
if
i
asked
you
to
play
just
one
little
piece
because
of
course
you
are
here
to
enjoy
yourself
and
talk
to
your
friends
and
it
seems
unkind
to
take
you
away
from
them
a
strange
moisture
dimmed
the
poor
german
eyes
this
was
the
first
time
in
england
that
the
celebrate
had
been
treated
as
a
friend
and
a
gentleman
up
to
this
moment
at
all
the
at
homes
and
assemblies
he
had
not
been
considered
as
a
guest
at
all
he
was
an
artist
a
good
pianist
a
man
who
had
played
before
the
emperor
of
germany
and
he
was
expected
to
perform
for
nothing
and
be
grateful
for
the
influence
exercised
on
his
behalf
influence
which
as
yet
had
not
put
one
single
extra
guinea
in
his
pocket
now
here
was
a
great
lady
almost
apologizing
for
asking
him
to
play
lest
it
should
take
him
away
from
his
friends
his
heart
swelled
with
emotion
and
gratitude
the
poor
fellow
had
no
friends
in
london
except
beau
lovelace
who
was
kind
to
him
but
who
had
no
power
in
the
musical
world
and
as
thelma
gentle
voice
addressed
him
he
could
have
knelt
and
kissed
her
little
shoe
for
her
sweet
courtesy
and
kindness
miladi
he
said
with
a
profound
reverence
i
will
blay
for
you
with
bleasure
it
will
be
a
joy
for
ze
music
to
make
itself
beautiful
for
you
and
with
this
fantastic
attempt
at
a
compliment
he
seated
himself
at
the
instrument
and
struck
a
crashing
chord
to
command
silence
the
hum
of
conversation
grew
louder
than
ever
and
to
thelma
surprise
lady
winsleigh
seated
herself
by
her
and
began
to
converse
herr
machtenklinken
struck
another
chord
in
vain
the
deafening
clamor
of
tongues
continued
and
lady
winsleigh
asked
thelma
with
much
seeming
interest
if
the
scenery
was
very
romantic
in
norway
the
girl
colored
deeply
and
after
a
little
hesitation
said
excuse
me
i
would
rather
not
speak
till
the
music
is
over
it
is
impossible
for
a
great
musician
to
think
his
thoughts
out
properly
unless
there
is
silence
would
it
not
be
better
to
ask
every
one
to
leave
off
talking
while
this
gentleman
plays
clara
winsleigh
looked
amused
my
dear
you
do
know
them
she
said
carelessly
they
would
think
me
mad
to
propose
such
a
thing
there
are
always
a
few
who
listen
once
more
the
pianist
poised
his
hands
over
the
keys
of
the
instrument
thelma
looked
a
little
troubled
and
grieved
beau
lovelace
saw
it
and
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
turned
towards
the
chattering
crowds
and
holding
up
his
hand
called
silence
please
there
was
an
astonished
hush
beau
laughed
we
want
to
hear
some
music
he
said
with
the
utmost
coolness
conversation
can
be
continued
afterwards
he
then
nodded
cheerfully
towards
herr
machtenklinken
who
inspired
by
this
open
encouragement
started
off
like
a
into
one
of
the
exquisite
rambling
preludes
of
chopin
gradually
as
he
played
his
plain
face
took
upon
itself
a
noble
thoughtful
rapt
expression
his
wild
eyes
softened
his
furrowed
frowning
brow
smoothed
and
meeting
the
grave
rare
blue
eyes
of
thelma
he
smiled
his
touch
grew
more
and
more
delicate
and
tender
from
the
prelude
he
wandered
into
a
nocturne
of
plaintive
and
exceeding
melancholy
which
he
played
with
thrilling
and
exquisite
pathos
anon
he
glided
into
one
of
those
dreamily
joyous
yet
sorrowful
mazurkas
that
remind
one
of
bright
flowers
growing
in
wild
luxuriance
over
lonely
and
forsaken
graves
the
celebrate
had
reason
to
boast
of
himself
he
was
a
perfect
master
of
the
instrument
and
as
his
fingers
closed
on
the
final
chord
a
hearty
burst
of
applause
rewarded
his
efforts
led
by
lovelace
and
lorimer
he
responded
by
the
usual
bow
but
his
real
gratitude
was
all
for
thelma
for
her
he
had
played
his
best
and
he
had
seen
tears
in
her
lovely
eyes
he
felt
as
proud
of
her
appreciation
as
of
the
ring
he
had
received
from
the
tsar
and
bent
low
over
the
fair
hand
she
extended
to
him
you
must
be
very
happy
she
said
to
feel
all
those
lovely
sounds
in
your
heart
i
hope
i
shall
see
and
hear
you
again
some
day
i
thank
you
so
very
much
for
the
pleasure
you
have
given
me
lady
winsleigh
said
nothing
and
she
listened
to
thelma
words
with
a
sort
of
contempt
is
the
girl
she
thought
she
must
be
or
she
would
not
be
so
absurdly
enthusiastic
the
man
plays
well
but
it
is
his
profession
to
play
well
it
no
good
praising
these
sort
of
people
they
are
never
grateful
and
they
always
impose
upon
you
aloud
she
asked
sir
philip
does
lady
errington
play
a
little
he
answered
she
sings
at
once
there
was
a
chorus
of
inanely
polite
voices
round
the
piano
oh
sing
lady
errington
please
give
us
one
song
and
sir
francis
lennox
sauntering
up
fixed
his
languorous
gaze
on
face
murmuring
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
refuse
us
such
delight
but
of
course
not
answered
the
girl
greatly
surprised
at
all
these
unnecessary
entreaties
i
am
always
pleased
to
sing
and
she
drew
off
her
long
loose
gloves
and
seated
herself
at
the
piano
without
the
least
affectation
of
reluctance
then
glancing
at
her
husband
with
a
bright
smile
she
asked
what
song
do
you
think
will
be
best
philip
one
of
those
old
norse
he
answered
she
played
a
soft
minor
prelude
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
room
now
everybody
pressed
towards
the
piano
staring
with
a
curious
fascination
at
her
beautiful
face
and
hair
one
moment
and
her
voice
in
all
its
passionate
glorious
fullness
rang
out
with
a
fresh
vibrating
tone
that
thrilled
to
the
very
heart
and
the
foolish
crowd
that
gaped
and
listened
was
speechless
motionless
astonished
and
bewildered
a
norse
was
it
how
strange
and
grand
and
wild
george
lorimer
stood
apart
his
eyes
ached
with
restrained
tears
he
knew
the
melody
well
and
up
before
him
rose
the
dear
solemnity
of
the
altenguard
hills
the
glittering
expanse
of
the
fjord
the
dear
old
farmhouse
behind
its
cluster
of
pines
again
he
saw
thelma
as
he
had
seen
her
first
clad
in
her
plain
white
gown
spinning
in
the
dark
embrasure
of
the
window
again
the
words
of
the
sigurd
came
back
to
his
recollection
good
things
may
come
for
others
but
for
you
the
heavens
are
empty
he
looked
at
her
now
philip
wife
in
all
the
splendor
of
her
rich
attire
she
was
lovelier
than
ever
and
her
sweet
nature
was
as
yet
unspoilt
by
all
the
wealth
and
luxury
around
her
good
god
what
an
she
has
come
into
he
thought
vaguely
how
will
she
stand
these
people
when
she
gets
to
know
them
the
van
clupps
the
and
others
like
them
and
as
for
clara
winsleigh
he
turned
to
study
her
ladyship
attentively
she
was
sitting
quite
close
to
the
piano
her
eyes
were
cast
down
but
the
rubies
on
her
bosom
heaved
quickly
and
restlessly
and
she
furled
and
unfurled
her
fan
impatiently
i
should
wonder
he
went
on
meditating
gravely
if
she
does
try
and
make
some
mischief
somehow
she
looks
it
at
that
moment
thelma
ceased
singing
and
the
room
rang
with
applause
herr
machtenklinken
was
overcome
with
admiration
it
is
a
voice
of
heaven
he
said
in
a
rapture
the
fair
singer
was
surrounded
with
people
i
hope
said
van
clupp
with
her
usual
eagerness
to
ingratiate
herself
with
the
titled
and
wealthy
i
hope
you
will
come
and
see
me
lady
errington
i
am
at
home
every
friday
evening
to
my
friends
oh
yes
said
thelma
simply
but
i
am
not
your
friend
yet
when
we
do
know
each
other
better
i
will
come
we
shall
meet
each
other
many
times
first
and
then
you
will
see
if
you
like
me
to
be
your
friend
is
it
not
so
a
scarcely
concealed
smile
reflected
itself
on
the
faces
of
all
who
heard
this
naïve
but
indefinite
acceptance
of
van
invitation
while
van
clupp
herself
was
somewhat
mortified
and
knew
not
what
to
answer
this
norwegian
girl
was
evidently
quite
ignorant
of
the
usages
of
polite
society
or
she
would
at
once
have
recognized
the
fact
that
an
at
home
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
obligations
of
friendship
besides
as
far
as
friendship
was
concerned
had
not
van
clupp
tabooed
several
of
her
own
and
former
intimate
acquaintances
for
the
very
sensible
reason
that
while
she
had
grown
richer
they
had
grown
poorer
but
now
sailed
up
in
all
her
glory
with
her
smile
and
matronly
air
she
was
a
privileged
person
and
she
put
her
arm
round
thelma
waist
you
must
come
to
me
my
dear
she
said
with
real
kindness
her
motherly
heart
had
warmed
to
the
girl
beauty
and
innocence
i
knew
philip
when
he
was
quite
a
boy
he
will
tell
you
what
a
dreadfully
old
woman
i
am
you
must
try
to
like
me
for
his
sake
thelma
smiled
radiantly
i
always
wish
to
like
philip
friends
she
said
frankly
i
do
hope
i
shall
please
you
a
pang
of
remorse
smote
heart
as
she
remembered
how
loth
she
had
been
to
meet
philip
peasant
wife
she
hesitated
then
yielding
to
her
warm
impulse
drew
the
girl
closer
and
kissed
her
fair
cheek
you
please
everybody
my
child
she
said
honestly
philip
is
a
lucky
man
now
i
say
good
night
for
it
is
getting
late
i
write
to
you
and
fix
a
day
for
you
to
come
and
lunch
with
me
but
you
must
also
come
and
see
philip
returned
thelma
pressing
her
hand
so
i
will
so
i
will
and
nodded
beamingly
and
made
her
way
up
to
lady
winsleigh
saying
clara
thanks
for
a
most
charming
evening
clara
pouted
going
already
mimsey
she
queried
then
in
a
lower
tone
she
said
well
what
do
you
think
of
her
a
beautiful
child
no
more
answered
marvelle
then
studying
with
some
gravity
the
brilliant
brunette
face
before
her
she
added
in
a
whisper
leave
her
alone
clara
do
make
her
miserable
you
know
what
i
mean
it
would
take
much
to
break
her
heart
clara
laughed
harshly
and
played
with
her
fan
dear
me
mimsey
you
are
perfectly
outrageous
do
you
think
i
an
ogress
ready
to
eat
her
up
on
the
contrary
i
mean
to
be
a
friend
to
her
marvelle
still
looked
grave
i
glad
to
hear
it
she
said
only
some
friends
are
worse
than
declared
enemies
lady
winsleigh
shrugged
her
shoulders
go
along
mimsey
go
home
to
bed
she
exclaimed
impatiently
you
are
i
hate
sentimental
philosophy
and
platitudes
she
laughed
again
and
folded
her
hands
with
an
air
of
mock
penitence
there
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
dear
old
darling
clara
and
marvelle
summoning
her
timid
husband
from
some
far
corner
where
he
had
remained
in
hiding
took
her
departure
with
much
stateliness
a
great
many
people
were
going
down
to
supper
by
this
time
but
sir
philip
was
tired
of
the
heat
and
glare
and
noise
and
whispered
as
much
to
thelma
who
at
once
advanced
to
bid
her
hostess
farewell
wo
you
have
some
supper
inquired
her
ladyship
do
go
yet
but
thelma
was
determined
not
to
detain
her
husband
a
moment
longer
than
he
wished
so
lady
winsleigh
seeing
remonstrances
were
of
no
avail
bade
them
both
an
effusive
we
must
see
a
great
deal
of
each
other
she
said
pressing
hands
warmly
in
her
own
i
hope
we
shall
be
quite
dear
friends
thank
you
said
thelma
i
do
hope
so
too
if
you
wish
it
so
much
lord
winsleigh
let
me
escort
you
to
your
carriage
said
her
noble
host
at
once
offering
her
his
arm
and
allow
me
to
follow
added
beau
lovelace
slipping
his
arm
through
errington
to
whom
he
whispered
how
dare
you
sir
how
dare
you
be
such
a
provokingly
happy
man
in
this
miserable
old
world
errington
laughed
and
the
little
group
had
just
reached
the
door
of
the
when
thelma
suddenly
turned
with
a
look
of
inquiry
in
her
eyes
where
is
mr
lorimer
she
said
i
have
forgotten
to
say
to
him
philip
here
i
am
lady
errington
and
lorimer
sauntered
forward
with
rather
a
forced
smile
a
smile
which
altogether
vanished
leaving
his
face
strangely
pale
as
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
and
said
laughingly
you
bad
lorimer
where
were
you
you
know
it
would
make
me
quite
unhappy
not
to
wish
you
ah
you
are
a
very
naughty
brother
come
home
with
us
george
said
sir
philip
eagerly
do
there
a
good
fellow
i
ca
phil
answered
lorimer
almost
pathetically
i
indeed
i
ca
do
ask
me
and
he
wrung
his
friend
hand
hard
and
then
bravely
met
thelma
bright
glance
forgive
me
he
said
to
her
i
know
i
ought
to
have
presented
myself
before
i
a
dreadfully
lazy
fellow
you
know
thelma
regarded
him
steadfastly
you
look
what
is
it
you
call
yourself
sometimes
she
observed
not
well
at
all
mind
you
come
to
us
he
promised
and
then
accompanied
them
down
to
their
carriage
he
and
beau
lovelace
assisting
to
cover
thelma
with
her
fur
cloak
and
being
the
last
to
shake
hands
with
sir
philip
as
he
sprang
in
beside
his
wife
and
called
to
the
coachman
home
the
magic
word
seemed
to
effect
the
horses
for
they
started
at
a
brisk
trot
and
within
a
couple
of
minutes
the
carriage
was
out
of
sight
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
as
lorimer
and
lovelace
winsleigh
house
beau
stole
a
at
his
silent
companion
a
plucky
fellow
he
mused
i
should
say
he
die
game
tortures
wring
his
secret
out
of
him
aloud
he
said
i
say
have
we
had
enough
of
this
do
let
us
sup
here
nothing
but
unsubstantial
pastry
and
claretcup
the
latter
abominable
mixture
would
kill
me
come
on
to
the
club
will
you
lorimer
gladly
assented
they
got
their
from
the
officious
briggs
tipped
him
handsomely
and
departed
arm
in
arm
the
last
glimpse
they
caught
of
the
winsleigh
festivities
was
marcia
van
clupp
sitting
on
the
stairs
polishing
off
with
much
gusto
the
wing
and
of
a
capon
while
the
mild
lord
masherville
stood
on
the
step
just
above
her
consoling
his
appetite
with
a
spoonful
of
tepid
yellow
jelly
he
had
not
been
able
to
secure
any
capon
for
himself
he
had
been
frightened
away
by
the
warning
cry
of
ladies
first
shouted
forth
by
a
fat
gentleman
who
was
on
guard
at
the
head
of
the
and
who
had
already
secreted
five
plates
of
different
edibles
for
his
own
consumption
in
a
neat
corner
behind
the
meanwhile
sir
philip
proud
happy
and
triumphant
drew
his
wife
into
a
close
embrace
as
they
drove
home
together
and
said
you
were
the
queen
of
the
evening
my
thelma
have
you
enjoyed
yourself
oh
i
do
not
call
that
enjoyment
she
declared
how
is
it
possible
to
enjoy
anything
among
so
many
strangers
well
what
is
it
he
asked
laughingly
she
laughed
also
i
do
not
know
indeed
what
it
is
she
said
i
have
never
been
to
anything
like
it
before
it
did
seem
to
me
as
if
all
the
people
were
on
show
for
some
reason
or
other
and
the
gentlemen
did
look
very
tired
there
was
nothing
for
them
to
do
even
you
my
boy
you
made
several
very
big
yawns
did
you
know
that
philip
laughed
more
than
ever
i
did
know
it
my
pet
he
answered
but
i
not
surprised
big
yawns
are
the
invariable
result
of
an
home
do
you
like
beau
lovelace
very
much
she
answered
readily
but
philip
i
should
not
like
to
have
so
many
friends
as
lady
winsleigh
i
thought
friends
were
rare
so
they
are
she
does
care
for
these
people
a
bit
they
are
mere
acquaintances
whom
does
she
care
for
then
asked
thelma
suddenly
of
course
i
mean
after
her
husband
naturally
she
loves
him
best
naturally
and
philip
paused
adding
she
has
her
son
ernest
he
a
fine
bright
boy
he
was
not
there
you
must
see
him
some
day
then
i
think
her
favorite
friend
is
mrs
i
do
like
that
lady
too
said
thelma
she
spoke
very
kindly
to
me
and
kissed
me
did
she
really
and
philip
smiled
i
think
she
was
more
to
be
congratulated
on
taking
the
kiss
than
you
in
receiving
it
but
she
not
a
bad
old
soul
only
a
little
too
fond
of
money
but
thelma
whom
do
care
for
most
you
did
tell
me
once
but
i
forget
she
turned
her
lovely
face
and
eyes
upon
him
and
meeting
his
laughing
look
she
smiled
how
often
must
i
tell
you
she
murmured
softly
i
do
think
you
will
never
tire
of
hearing
you
know
that
it
is
you
for
whom
i
care
most
and
that
all
the
world
would
be
empty
to
me
without
you
oh
my
husband
my
darling
do
not
make
me
try
to
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
i
can
not
my
heart
is
too
full
the
rest
of
their
drive
homeward
was
very
quiet
there
are
times
when
silence
is
more
eloquent
than
speech
chapter
xxi
a
small
cloud
so
slight
as
to
be
a
mere
speck
on
the
fair
blue
sky
was
all
the
warning
we
pliny
after
that
evening
great
changes
came
into
thelma
before
peaceful
life
she
had
conquered
her
enemies
or
so
it
seemed
society
threw
down
all
its
barricades
and
rushed
to
meet
her
with
open
arms
invitations
crowded
upon
her
often
she
grew
tired
and
bewildered
in
the
multiplicity
of
them
all
london
life
wearied
her
she
preferred
the
embowered
seclusion
of
errington
manor
the
dear
old
house
in
warwickshire
but
the
season
claimed
her
its
frothy
gaieties
were
deemed
incomplete
without
her
no
at
home
was
considered
quite
the
thing
unless
she
was
present
she
became
the
centre
of
a
large
and
social
circle
painters
poets
novelists
wits
savants
and
celebrities
of
high
distinction
crowded
her
rooms
striving
to
entertain
her
as
well
as
themselves
with
that
inane
small
talk
and
gossip
too
often
practiced
by
the
wisest
among
us
and
thus
surrounded
she
began
to
learn
many
puzzling
and
painful
things
of
which
in
her
old
norwegian
life
she
had
been
happily
ignorant
for
instance
she
had
once
imagined
that
all
the
men
and
women
of
culture
who
followed
the
higher
professions
must
perforce
be
a
sort
of
joyous
fraternity
superior
to
other
mortals
not
so
gifted
and
under
this
erroneous
impression
she
was
at
first
eager
to
know
some
of
the
great
people
who
had
distinguished
themselves
in
literature
or
the
fine
arts
she
had
fancied
that
they
must
of
necessity
be
all
refined
sympathetic
and
alas
how
grievously
was
she
disappointed
she
found
to
her
sorrow
that
the
tree
of
modern
art
bore
but
few
wholesome
roses
and
many
cankered
buds
that
the
joyous
fraternity
were
not
joyous
at
all
but
on
the
contrary
inclined
to
dyspepsia
and
discontentment
she
found
that
even
poets
whom
she
had
fondly
deemed
were
the
among
the
children
of
this
earth
were
most
of
them
painfully
conceited
selfish
in
aim
and
limited
in
thought
moreover
that
they
were
often
so
empty
of
all
true
inspiration
that
they
were
actually
able
to
hate
and
envy
one
another
with
a
sort
of
womanish
spite
and
temper
that
novelists
professing
to
be
in
sympathy
with
the
heart
of
humanity
were
no
sooner
brought
into
contact
one
with
another
than
they
plainly
showed
by
look
voice
and
manner
the
contempt
they
entertained
for
each
other
work
that
men
of
science
were
never
so
happy
as
when
trying
to
upset
each
theories
that
men
of
religious
combativeness
were
always
on
the
alert
to
destroy
each
other
creeds
and
that
in
short
there
was
a
very
general
tendency
to
mean
jealousies
miserable
and
utter
weariness
all
round
on
one
occasion
she
in
the
sweetest
simplicity
invited
two
lady
authoresses
of
note
to
meet
at
one
of
her
at
homes
she
welcomed
both
the
ladies
with
a
radiant
smile
and
introduced
them
saying
gently
you
will
be
so
pleased
to
know
each
other
but
the
stony
stare
stiff
nod
portentous
sniff
and
scornful
smile
with
which
these
two
eminent
females
exchanged
cold
greetings
were
enough
to
daunt
the
most
sympathetic
hostess
that
ever
lived
and
when
they
at
once
retired
to
different
corners
of
the
room
and
sat
apart
with
their
backs
turned
to
one
another
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
their
attitude
was
so
uncompromising
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
gentle
thelma
felt
quite
dismayed
and
wretched
at
the
utter
failure
of
the
they
would
be
sociable
she
afterwards
complained
to
lady
winsleigh
they
to
be
as
rude
to
each
other
as
they
could
lady
winsleigh
laughed
of
course
she
said
what
else
you
expect
but
if
you
want
some
fun
ask
a
young
pretty
and
brilliant
authoress
there
are
a
few
such
to
meet
an
old
ugly
and
dowdy
one
and
there
are
many
such
and
watch
the
dowdy
one
face
it
will
be
a
delicious
study
of
expression
i
assure
you
but
thelma
would
not
try
this
delicate
experiment
in
fact
she
began
rather
to
avoid
literary
people
with
the
exception
of
beau
lovelace
his
was
a
genial
sympathetic
nature
and
moreover
he
had
a
winning
charm
of
manner
which
few
could
resist
he
was
not
a
bookworm
he
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
literary
man
and
he
was
entirely
indifferent
to
public
praise
or
blame
he
was
as
he
himself
expressed
it
a
servant
and
worshipper
of
literature
and
there
is
a
wide
gulf
of
difference
between
one
who
serves
literature
for
its
own
sake
and
one
who
uses
it
basely
as
a
tool
to
serve
himself
but
in
all
her
new
and
varied
experiences
perhaps
thelma
was
most
completely
bewildered
by
the
women
she
met
her
simple
norse
beliefs
in
the
purity
and
gentleness
of
womanhood
were
startled
and
outraged
she
could
not
understand
london
ladies
at
all
some
of
them
seemed
to
have
no
idea
beyond
dress
and
show
others
looked
upon
their
husbands
the
lawful
protectors
of
their
name
and
fame
with
easy
indifference
as
though
they
were
mere
bits
of
household
furniture
others
having
nothing
better
to
do
went
in
for
spiritualism
the
low
spiritualism
that
manifests
itself
in
the
turning
of
tables
and
moving
of
not
the
higher
spiritualism
of
an
improved
perfected
and
way
of
life
and
these
argued
wildly
on
the
theory
of
matter
passing
through
matter
to
the
extent
of
declaring
themselves
able
to
send
a
letter
or
box
through
the
wall
without
making
a
hole
in
it
and
this
with
such
obstinate
gravity
as
made
thelma
fear
for
their
reason
then
there
were
the
creatures
who
had
voluntarily
crushed
all
the
sweetness
of
the
sex
within
them
foolish
human
flowers
without
fragrance
that
persistently
turned
away
their
faces
from
the
sunlight
and
denied
its
existence
preferring
to
wither
profitless
on
the
dry
stalk
of
their
own
theory
there
were
the
unnatural
products
of
an
unnatural
age
there
were
the
great
ladies
of
the
aristocracy
who
turned
with
scorn
from
a
case
of
real
necessity
and
yet
spent
hundreds
of
pounds
on
private
theatricals
wherein
they
might
have
the
chance
of
displaying
themselves
in
extravagant
costumes
and
there
were
the
professional
beauties
who
if
suddenly
deprived
of
elegant
attire
and
turned
out
to
be
no
beauties
at
all
but
very
ordinary
unintelligent
persons
what
is
the
exact
meaning
of
the
term
beauty
thelma
had
asked
beau
lovelace
on
one
occasion
i
suppose
it
is
some
very
poor
beautiful
woman
who
takes
money
for
showing
herself
to
the
public
and
having
her
portraits
sold
in
the
shops
and
who
is
it
that
pays
her
lovelace
broke
into
a
laugh
upon
my
word
lady
errington
you
have
put
the
matter
in
a
most
original
but
indubitably
correct
light
who
pays
the
beauty
you
ask
well
in
the
case
of
whom
you
met
the
other
day
it
is
a
certain
duke
who
pays
her
to
the
tune
of
several
thousands
a
year
when
he
gets
tired
of
her
or
she
of
him
she
find
somebody
else
or
perhaps
she
go
on
the
stage
and
swell
the
list
of
bad
amateurs
she
get
on
somehow
as
long
as
she
can
find
a
fool
ready
to
settle
her
dressmaker
bill
i
do
not
understand
said
thelma
and
her
fair
brows
drew
together
in
that
pained
grave
look
that
was
becoming
rather
frequent
with
her
now
and
she
began
to
ask
fewer
questions
concerning
the
various
strange
phases
of
social
life
that
puzzled
her
why
for
instance
religious
theorists
made
so
little
practical
use
of
their
theories
why
there
were
eccentrics
who
admired
the
faulty
drawing
of
watts
and
the
of
walt
whitman
why
members
of
parliament
talked
so
much
and
did
so
little
why
new
poets
however
nobly
inspired
were
never
accepted
unless
they
had
influential
friends
on
the
press
why
painters
always
married
their
models
or
their
cooks
and
got
heartily
ashamed
of
them
afterwards
and
why
people
all
round
said
so
many
things
they
did
not
mean
and
confused
by
the
general
insincerity
she
clung
poor
child
to
lady
winsleigh
who
had
the
tact
to
seem
what
she
was
not
and
the
cleverness
to
probe
into
thelma
nature
and
find
out
how
translucently
clear
and
pure
it
was
a
perfect
well
of
sweet
water
into
which
one
drop
of
poison
or
better
still
several
drops
gradually
and
insidiously
instilled
might
in
time
taint
its
flavor
and
darken
its
brightness
for
if
a
woman
have
an
innocent
unsuspecting
soul
as
delicate
as
the
curled
cup
of
a
nile
lily
the
more
easily
will
it
droop
and
wither
in
the
heated
grasp
of
a
careless
cruel
hand
and
to
this
task
lady
winsleigh
set
herself
partly
for
malice
pretense
against
errington
whose
coldness
to
herself
in
past
days
had
wounded
her
vanity
and
partly
for
private
jealousy
of
thelma
beauty
and
attractiveness
within
a
short
time
she
had
completely
won
the
girl
confidence
and
affection
sir
philip
forgetting
his
former
suspicions
of
her
was
touched
and
disarmed
by
the
attachment
and
admiration
she
openly
displayed
towards
his
young
wife
she
and
thelma
were
constantly
seen
together
and
as
she
generally
was
often
sighed
doubtfully
and
rubbed
her
nose
in
perplexity
as
she
confessed
she
could
quite
understand
clara
but
had
her
hands
full
of
other
matters
she
was
aiding
and
abetting
marcia
van
clupp
to
set
traps
for
that
mild
mouse
lord
masherville
and
she
was
too
much
absorbed
in
this
difficult
and
delicate
business
to
attend
to
anything
else
just
then
otherwise
it
is
possible
she
might
have
scented
danger
for
thelma
peace
of
mind
and
being
might
have
warded
it
off
before
it
approached
too
closely
but
like
policeman
who
are
never
within
call
when
wanted
so
friends
are
seldom
at
hand
when
their
influence
might
be
of
real
benefit
the
van
clupps
were
people
thelma
could
not
get
on
with
at
all
she
tried
to
do
so
because
had
assured
her
they
were
charming
and
she
liked
marvelle
sufficiently
well
to
be
willing
to
please
her
but
in
truth
these
rich
and
vulgar
yankees
seemed
to
her
mind
less
to
be
esteemed
than
the
peasants
of
the
altenfjord
who
in
many
instances
possessed
finer
tact
and
breeding
than
old
van
clupp
the
man
of
many
dollars
whose
father
had
been
nothing
but
a
low
navvy
but
of
whom
he
spoke
now
with
smirking
pride
as
a
real
descendant
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
an
odd
thing
it
is
by
the
way
how
fond
some
americans
are
of
tracing
back
their
ancestry
to
these
virtuous
old
gentlemen
the
van
clupps
were
of
course
not
the
best
types
of
their
country
they
were
of
that
class
who
because
they
have
money
measure
everything
by
the
and
hold
even
a
noble
poverty
in
utter
contempt
poor
van
clupp
it
was
sometimes
pitiable
to
see
him
trying
to
be
a
gentleman
going
in
for
style
to
an
excess
that
was
ludicrous
cramming
his
house
with
expensive
furniture
like
an
upholsterer
drinking
his
tea
out
of
pure
sevres
with
a
lofty
ignorance
of
its
beauty
and
value
dressing
his
wife
and
daughter
like
shilling
and
having
his
portrait
taken
in
precisely
the
same
attitude
as
that
assumed
by
the
duke
of
wrigglesbury
when
his
grace
sat
to
the
same
photographer
it
was
delicious
to
hear
him
bragging
of
his
pilgrim
ancestor
while
in
the
same
breath
he
would
blandly
sneer
at
certain
poor
gentry
who
could
trace
back
their
lineage
to
coeur
de
lion
but
because
the
erringtons
were
rich
as
well
as
titled
persons
van
clupp
and
his
belongings
bent
the
servile
knee
before
them
flattering
thelma
with
that
eagerness
and
zealous
persistency
which
distinguish
inborn
vulgarity
and
which
far
from
pleasing
her
annoyed
and
embarrassed
her
because
she
could
not
respond
sincerely
to
such
attentions
there
were
many
others
too
not
americans
whose
excessive
adulation
and
ceaseless
compliment
vexed
the
sincere
frank
spirit
of
the
girl
a
spirit
fresh
and
pure
as
the
wind
blowing
over
her
own
norse
mountains
one
of
these
was
sir
francis
lennox
that
fashionable
young
man
of
leisure
and
she
had
for
him
an
instinctive
though
quite
unreasonable
aversion
he
was
courtesy
itself
he
spared
no
pains
to
please
her
yet
she
felt
as
if
his
basilisk
brown
eyes
were
always
upon
her
he
seemed
to
be
ever
at
hand
ready
to
watch
over
her
in
trifles
such
as
the
passing
of
a
cup
of
tea
the
offering
of
her
wrap
the
finding
of
a
chair
the
holding
of
a
fan
he
was
always
on
the
alert
like
a
remarkably
upper
servant
she
could
not
without
rudeness
reject
such
unobtrusive
humble
services
and
yet
they
rendered
her
uncomfortable
though
she
did
not
quite
know
why
she
ventured
to
mention
her
feeling
concerning
him
to
her
friend
lady
winsleigh
who
heard
her
timid
remarks
with
a
look
on
her
face
that
was
not
quite
pleasant
poor
sir
francis
her
ladyship
said
with
a
slight
mocking
laugh
he
never
happy
unless
he
plays
do
mind
him
thelma
he
wo
bite
i
assure
you
he
means
no
harm
it
only
his
little
way
of
making
himself
agreeable
george
lorimer
during
this
particular
london
season
fled
the
field
of
action
and
went
to
paris
to
stay
with
pierre
duprèz
he
felt
that
it
was
dangerous
to
confront
the
fair
enemy
too
often
for
he
knew
in
his
own
honest
heart
that
his
passion
for
thelma
increased
each
time
he
saw
her
so
he
avoided
her
she
missed
him
very
much
from
her
circle
of
intimates
and
often
went
to
see
his
mother
lorimer
one
of
the
sweetest
old
ladies
in
the
world
who
had
at
once
guessed
her
secret
but
like
a
prudent
dame
kept
it
to
herself
there
were
few
young
women
as
pretty
and
charming
as
old
lorimer
with
her
parted
hair
and
mild
blue
eyes
and
voice
as
cheery
as
the
note
of
a
thrush
in
after
lady
winsleigh
thelma
liked
her
best
of
all
her
new
friends
and
was
fond
of
visiting
her
quiet
little
house
in
kensington
for
it
was
very
quiet
and
seemed
like
a
sheltered
haven
of
rest
from
the
great
rush
of
frivolity
and
folly
in
which
the
fashionable
world
delighted
and
thelma
was
often
now
in
need
of
rest
as
the
season
drew
towards
its
close
she
found
herself
strangely
tired
and
dispirited
the
life
she
was
compelled
to
lead
was
all
unsuited
to
her
nature
it
was
artificial
and
constrained
and
she
was
often
unhappy
why
why
indeed
she
did
her
best
but
she
made
enemies
everywhere
again
why
because
she
had
a
most
pernicious
most
unpleasant
habit
of
telling
the
truth
like
socrates
she
seemed
to
say
if
any
man
should
appear
to
me
not
to
possess
virtue
but
to
pretend
that
he
does
i
shall
reproach
him
this
she
expressed
silently
in
face
voice
and
manner
and
like
socrates
she
might
have
added
that
she
went
about
perceiving
indeed
and
grieving
and
alarmed
that
she
was
making
herself
odious
for
she
discovered
by
degrees
that
many
people
looked
strangely
upon
her
that
others
seemed
afraid
of
her
and
she
continually
heard
that
she
was
considered
eccentric
so
she
became
more
reserved
even
cold
she
was
content
to
let
others
argue
about
trifles
and
air
their
whims
and
follies
without
offering
an
opinion
on
any
side
and
the
first
shadow
began
to
sweep
over
the
fairness
of
her
married
life
it
happened
at
a
time
when
she
and
her
husband
were
not
quite
so
much
together
society
and
its
various
claims
had
naturally
separated
them
a
little
but
now
a
question
of
political
ambition
separated
them
still
more
some
friends
had
persuaded
sir
philip
to
stand
for
parliament
and
this
idea
no
sooner
entered
his
head
than
he
decided
with
impulsive
ardor
that
he
had
been
too
long
without
a
career
and
a
career
he
must
have
in
order
to
win
distinction
for
his
wife
sake
therefore
summoning
his
secretary
neville
to
his
aid
he
plunged
headlong
into
the
seething
turgid
waters
of
english
politics
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
library
day
after
day
studying
writing
and
answering
letters
and
drawing
up
addresses
and
with
the
general
proneness
of
the
masculine
mind
to
attend
to
one
thing
only
at
a
time
he
grew
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
his
love
for
thelma
though
all
unchanged
and
deep
as
ever
fell
slightly
into
the
background
of
his
thoughts
not
that
he
neglected
her
he
simply
concerned
himself
more
with
other
things
so
it
happened
that
a
certain
indefinable
sense
of
loss
weighed
upon
her
a
vague
uncomprehended
solitude
began
to
encompass
her
a
solitude
even
more
keenly
felt
when
she
was
surrounded
by
friends
than
when
she
was
quite
alone
and
as
the
sweet
english
june
drew
to
its
end
she
grew
languid
and
listless
and
her
blue
eyes
often
filled
with
sudden
tears
her
little
britta
began
to
notice
this
and
to
wonder
concerning
the
reason
of
her
mistress
altered
looks
it
is
this
dreadful
london
thought
britta
so
hot
and
stifling
there
no
fresh
air
for
her
and
all
this
going
about
to
balls
and
parties
and
shows
no
wonder
she
is
tired
out
but
it
was
something
more
than
mere
fatigue
that
made
thelma
eyes
look
sometimes
so
anxious
so
gravely
meditative
and
earnest
one
day
she
seemed
so
much
abstracted
and
lost
in
painful
musings
that
loving
heart
ached
and
she
watched
her
for
some
moments
without
venturing
to
say
a
word
at
last
she
spoke
out
bravely
fröken
she
paused
thelma
seemed
not
to
hear
her
fröken
has
anything
vexed
or
grieved
you
today
thelma
started
nervously
vexed
me
grieved
me
she
repeated
no
britta
why
do
you
ask
you
look
very
tired
dear
fröken
continued
britta
gently
you
are
not
as
bright
as
you
were
when
we
first
came
to
london
thelma
lips
quivered
i
i
am
not
well
britta
she
murmured
and
suddenly
her
gave
way
and
she
broke
into
tears
in
an
instant
britta
was
kneeling
by
her
coaxing
and
caressing
her
and
calling
her
by
every
endearing
name
she
could
think
of
while
she
wisely
forbore
from
asking
any
more
questions
presently
her
sobs
grew
calmer
she
rested
her
fair
head
against
britta
shoulder
and
smiled
faintly
at
that
moment
a
light
tap
was
heard
outside
and
a
voice
called
thelma
are
you
there
britta
opened
the
door
and
sir
philip
entered
hurriedly
and
smiling
but
stopped
short
to
survey
his
wife
in
dismay
why
my
darling
he
exclaimed
distressfully
have
you
been
crying
here
the
discreet
britta
retired
thelma
sprang
to
her
husband
and
nestled
in
his
arms
philip
do
not
mind
it
she
murmured
i
felt
a
little
sad
it
is
nothing
but
tell
me
you
love
me
you
will
never
tire
of
me
you
have
always
loved
me
i
am
sure
he
raised
her
face
gently
with
one
hand
and
looked
at
her
in
surprise
thelma
what
strange
questions
from
love
you
is
not
every
beat
of
my
heart
for
you
are
you
not
my
life
my
joy
my
everything
in
this
world
and
he
pressed
her
passionately
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
you
have
never
loved
any
one
else
so
much
she
whispered
half
abashed
never
he
answered
readily
what
makes
you
ask
such
a
thing
she
was
silent
he
looked
down
at
her
flushing
cheeks
and
lashes
attentively
you
are
fanciful
my
pet
he
said
at
last
you
been
tiring
yourself
too
much
you
must
rest
you
better
not
go
to
the
brilliant
theatre
it
only
a
burlesque
and
is
sure
to
be
vulgar
and
noisy
we
stop
at
home
and
spend
a
quiet
evening
together
shall
we
she
raised
her
eyes
half
wistfully
and
smiled
i
should
like
that
very
very
much
philip
she
murmured
but
you
know
we
did
promise
clara
to
go
with
her
and
as
we
are
so
soon
to
leave
london
and
return
to
warwickshire
i
should
not
like
to
disappoint
her
you
are
very
fond
of
clara
he
asked
suddenly
very
she
paused
and
sighed
slightly
she
is
so
kind
and
clever
much
more
clever
than
i
can
ever
be
and
she
knows
many
things
about
the
world
which
i
do
not
and
she
admires
you
so
much
philip
does
she
indeed
philip
laughed
and
colored
a
little
very
good
of
her
i
sure
and
so
you
really
like
to
go
to
the
brilliant
i
think
so
she
said
hesitatingly
clara
says
it
will
be
very
amusing
and
you
must
remember
how
much
i
enjoyed
and
errington
smiled
you
find
the
brilliant
performance
very
different
to
either
he
said
amusedly
you
do
know
what
a
burlesque
is
like
then
i
must
be
instructed
replied
thelma
smiling
also
i
need
to
learn
many
things
i
am
very
ignorant
ignorant
and
he
swept
aside
with
a
caressing
touch
the
clustering
hair
from
her
broad
noble
brow
my
darling
you
possess
the
greatest
wisdom
the
wisdom
of
innocence
i
would
not
change
it
for
all
the
learning
of
the
sagest
philosophers
you
really
mean
that
she
asked
half
timidly
i
really
mean
that
he
answered
fondly
little
sceptic
as
if
i
would
ever
say
anything
to
you
that
i
did
mean
i
shall
be
glad
when
we
out
of
london
and
back
at
the
manor
then
i
shall
have
you
all
to
myself
again
for
a
time
at
least
she
raised
her
eyes
full
of
sudden
joy
all
traces
of
her
former
depression
had
disappeared
and
shall
have
she
said
gladly
and
we
shall
not
disappoint
lady
winsleigh
philip
i
am
not
tired
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
go
to
the
theatre
all
right
responded
philip
cheerfully
so
let
it
be
only
i
believe
you
like
the
piece
though
it
certainly
wo
make
you
cry
yet
i
doubt
if
it
will
make
you
laugh
either
however
it
will
be
a
new
experience
for
you
and
a
new
experience
it
decidedly
was
an
experience
too
which
brought
some
strange
and
perplexing
results
to
thelma
of
which
she
never
dreamed
she
went
to
the
brilliant
accompanied
by
lady
winsleigh
and
her
husband
neville
the
secretary
making
the
fourth
in
their
box
and
during
the
first
and
second
scene
of
the
performance
the
stage
effects
were
so
pretty
and
the
dancing
so
graceful
that
she
nearly
forgot
the
bewildered
astonishment
she
had
at
first
felt
at
the
extreme
scantiness
of
apparel
worn
by
the
ladies
of
the
ballet
they
represented
birds
bees
butterflies
and
the
other
winged
denizens
of
the
and
the
was
so
and
brilliant
with
swift
movement
light
and
color
that
the
eye
was
too
dazzled
and
confused
to
note
objectionable
details
but
in
the
third
scene
when
a
plump
athletic
young
woman
leaped
on
the
stage
in
the
guise
of
a
with
a
feather
tunic
so
short
that
it
was
a
mere
of
extra
width
a
bodice
about
three
inches
high
and
a
pair
of
blue
wings
attached
to
her
fat
shoulders
thelma
started
and
half
rose
from
her
seat
in
dismay
while
a
hot
tide
of
color
crimsoned
her
cheeks
she
looked
nervously
at
her
husband
i
do
not
think
this
is
pleasant
to
see
she
said
in
a
low
tone
would
it
not
be
best
to
go
away
i
i
think
i
would
rather
be
at
home
lady
winsleigh
heard
and
smiled
a
little
mocking
smile
do
be
silly
child
she
said
if
you
leave
the
theatre
just
now
you
have
every
one
staring
at
you
that
woman
an
immense
favorite
she
is
the
success
of
the
piece
she
got
more
diamonds
than
either
you
or
i
thelma
regarded
her
friend
with
a
sort
of
grave
wonder
but
said
nothing
in
reply
if
lady
winsleigh
liked
the
performance
and
wished
to
remain
why
then
politeness
demanded
that
thelma
should
not
interfere
with
her
pleasure
by
taking
an
abrupt
leave
so
she
resumed
her
seat
but
withdrew
herself
far
behind
the
curtain
of
the
box
in
a
corner
where
the
stage
was
almost
invisible
to
her
eyes
her
husband
bent
over
her
and
whispered
i
take
you
home
if
you
wish
it
dear
only
say
the
word
she
shook
her
head
clara
enjoys
it
she
answered
somewhat
plaintively
we
must
stay
philip
was
about
to
address
lady
winsleigh
on
the
subject
when
suddenly
neville
touched
him
on
the
arm
can
i
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
moment
sir
philip
he
said
in
a
strange
hoarse
whisper
outside
the
box
away
from
the
ladies
a
matter
of
importance
he
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
faint
he
gasped
rather
than
spoke
these
words
his
face
was
white
as
death
and
his
eyes
had
a
confused
and
bewildered
stare
certainly
answered
philip
promptly
though
not
without
an
accent
of
surprise
and
excusing
their
absence
briefly
to
his
wife
and
lady
winsleigh
they
left
the
box
together
meanwhile
the
was
capering
extravagantly
before
the
footlights
pointing
her
toe
in
the
delighted
face
of
the
stalls
and
singing
in
a
in
a
loud
coarse
voice
the
following
refined
ditty
oh
my
ducky
oh
my
darling
oh
my
duck
duck
duck
if
you
love
me
you
must
have
a
little
pluck
pluck
pluck
come
and
put
your
arms
around
me
kiss
me
once
twice
thrice
for
kissing
may
be
naughty
but
by
jingo
it
is
nice
once
twice
thrice
nice
nice
nice
bliss
bliss
bliss
kiss
kiss
kiss
kissing
may
be
naughty
but
it
nice
there
were
several
verses
in
this
graceful
poem
and
each
one
was
hailed
with
enthusiastic
applause
the
was
triumphant
and
when
her
song
was
concluded
she
executed
a
startling
full
of
quaint
and
astonishing
surprises
reaching
her
superbest
climax
when
she
backed
off
the
stage
on
one
portly
leg
kicking
the
other
in
regular
time
to
the
orchestra
lady
winsleigh
laughed
and
leaning
towards
thelma
who
still
sat
in
her
retired
corner
said
with
a
show
of
kindness
you
dear
little
goose
you
must
get
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
thing
it
takes
with
the
men
immensely
why
even
your
wonderful
philip
has
gone
down
behind
the
scenes
with
neville
you
may
be
sure
of
that
the
startled
pitiful
astonishment
in
the
girl
face
might
have
touched
a
less
callous
heart
than
lady
winsleigh
but
her
ladyship
was
prepared
for
it
and
only
smiled
gone
behind
the
scenes
to
see
that
dreadful
woman
exclaimed
thelma
in
a
low
pained
tone
oh
no
clara
he
would
not
do
such
a
thing
impossible
well
my
dear
then
where
is
he
he
has
been
gone
quite
ten
minutes

at
the
stalls

the
men
are
out
of
them
i
tell
you
violet
vere
draws
everybody
of
the
male
sex
after
her
at
the
end
of
all
her
she
has
a
regular
reception
for
men
only
of
course
ladies
not
admitted
and
clara
winsleigh
laughed
do
look
so
shocked
for
heaven
sake
thelma
you
do
want
your
husband
to
be
a
regular
nincompoop
he
must
have
his
amusements
as
well
as
other
people

believe
you
want
him
to
be
like
a
baby
tied
to
your

that
an
awful
mistake

tired
to
death
of
you
sweet
little
griselda

thelma
face
grew
very
pale
and
her
hand
closed
more
tightly
on
the
fan
she
held
you
have
said
that
so
very
very
often
lately
clara
she
murmured
you
seem
so
sure
that
he
will
get
tired
that
all
men
get
tired
i
do
not
think
you
know
philip
he
is
not
like
any
other
person
i
have
ever
met
and
why
should
he
go
behind
the
scenes
to
such
a
person
as
violet
vere
at
that
moment
the
opened
with
a
sharp
click
and
errington
entered
alone
he
looked
disturbed
and
anxious
neville
is
not
well
he
said
abruptly
addressing
his
wife
i
sent
him
home
he
would
have
been
able
to
sit
this
thing
out
and
he
glanced
half
angrily
towards
the
stage
the
curtain
had
just
gone
up
again
and
displayed
the
wondrous
violet
vere
still
in
her
character
swinging
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
after
the
example
of
all
smoking
a
cigar
with
tranquillity
i
am
sorry
he
is
ill
said
thelma
gently
that
is
why
you
were
so
long
away
was
i
long
returned
philip
somewhat
absently
i
did
know
it
i
went
to
ask
a
question
behind
the
scenes
lady
winsleigh
coughed
and
glanced
at
thelma
whose
eyes
dropped
instantly
i
suppose
you
saw
violet
vere
asked
clara
yes
i
saw
her
he
replied
briefly
he
seemed
irritable
and
vexed
moreover
decidedly
impatient
presently
he
said
lady
winsleigh
would
you
mind
very
much
if
we
left
this
place
and
went
home
i
rather
anxious
about
neville
he
had
a
shock
thelma
care
a
bit
about
this
piece
i
know
and
if
you
are
not
very
much
absorbed
lady
winsleigh
rose
instantly
with
her
usual
ready
grace
my
dear
sir
philip
she
said
sweetly
as
if
i
would
not
do
anything
to
oblige
you
let
us
go
by
all
means
these
burlesques
extremely
fatiguing
he
seemed
relieved
by
her
acquiescence
and
smiled
that
rare
sweet
smile
of
his
which
had
once
played
such
havoc
with
her
ladyship
sensitive
feelings
they
left
the
theatre
and
were
soon
on
their
way
home
though
thelma
was
rather
silent
during
the
drive
they
dropped
lady
winsleigh
at
her
own
door
and
after
they
had
bidden
her
a
cordial
good
night
and
were
going
on
again
towards
home
philip
turning
towards
his
wife
and
catching
sight
of
her
face
by
the
light
of
a
was
struck
by
her
extreme
paleness
and
weary
look
you
are
very
tired
my
darling
i
fear
he
inquired
tenderly
encircling
her
with
one
arm
lean
your
head
on
my
shoulder
so
she
obeyed
and
her
hand
trembled
a
little
as
he
took
and
held
it
in
his
own
warm
strong
clasp
we
shall
soon
be
home
he
added
cheerily
and
i
think
we
must
have
no
more
this
season
the
heat
and
noise
and
glare
are
too
much
for
you
philip
said
thelma
suddenly
did
you
really
go
behind
the
scenes
yes
i
did
he
answered
readily
i
was
obliged
to
go
on
a
matter
of
business
a
very
disagreeable
and
unpleasant
matter
too
and
what
was
it
she
asked
timidly
yet
hopefully
my
pet
i
ca
tell
you
i
wish
i
could
it
a
secret
i
bound
not
to
betray
a
secret
which
involves
the
name
of
another
person
who
be
wretched
if
i
were
to
mention
it
to
you
there
do
let
us
talk
about
it
any
more
very
well
philip
said
thelma
resignedly
but
though
she
smiled
a
sudden
presentiment
of
evil
depressed
her
the
figure
of
the
vulgar
painted
creature
known
as
violet
vere
rose
up
mockingly
before
her
eyes
and
the
words
of
lady
winsleigh
rang
persistently
in
her
ears
on
reaching
home
philip
went
straight
to
neville
little
study
and
remained
with
him
in
earnest
conversation
for
a
long
time
while
thelma
went
to
bed
and
lay
restless
among
her
pillows
puzzling
her
brain
with
strange
forebodings
and
new
and
perplexing
ideas
till
fatigue
overpowered
her
and
she
fell
asleep
with
a
few
wet
on
her
lashes
and
that
night
philip
wondered
why
his
sweet
wife
talked
so
plaintively
in
her
sleep
though
he
smiled
as
he
listened
to
the
drift
of
those
murmurings
no
one
knows
how
my
boy
loves
me
sighed
the
dreaming
voice
no
one
in
all
the
world
how
should
he
tire
love
can
never
tire
meanwhile
lady
winsleigh
in
the
seclusion
of
her
own
boudoir
penned
a
brief
note
to
sir
francis
lennox
as
follows
dear
old
lennie
i
saw
you
in
the
stalls
at
the
theatre
this
evening
though
you
pretended
not
to
see
me
what
a
fickle
creature
you
are
not
that
i
mind
in
the
very
least
the
virtuous
left
his
saintly
wife
and
me
to
talk
little
platitudes
together
while
he
decorously
accompanied
by
his
secretary
went
down
to
pay
court
to
violet
vere
how
stout
she
is
getting
why
do
you
men
advise
her
to
diet
herself
i
know
you
also
went
behind
the
scenes
of
course
you
an
promising
boy
you
are
to
be
sure
come
and
lunch
with
me
if
you
not
too
lazy
yours
ever
clara
she
gave
this
missive
to
her
maid
louise
rénaud
to
post
that
faithful
attendant
took
it
first
to
her
own
apartment
where
she
ungummed
the
envelope
neatly
by
the
aid
of
hot
water
and
read
every
word
of
it
this
was
not
an
exceptional
action
of
hers
all
the
letters
received
and
sent
by
her
mistress
were
subjected
to
the
same
process
even
those
that
were
sealed
with
wax
she
had
a
means
of
opening
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
impossible
to
detect
that
they
had
been
tampered
with
she
was
a
very
clever
french
maid
was
louise
one
of
the
cleverest
of
her
class
fond
of
mischief
ever
suspicious
always
on
the
alert
for
evil
utterly
unscrupulous
and
malicious
she
was
an
altogether
admirable
attendant
for
a
lady
of
rank
and
fashion
her
skill
as
a
and
always
obtaining
for
her
the
wages
she
so
justly
deserved
when
will
wealthy
women
reared
in
idleness
and
luxury
learn
the
folly
of
keeping
a
trained
spy
attached
to
their
persons
a
spy
whose
pretended
calling
is
merely
to
arrange
dresses
and
fripperies
half
of
which
she
invariably
steals
but
whose
real
delight
is
to
take
note
of
all
her
mistress
incomings
and
outgoings
tempers
and
tears
to
watch
her
looks
her
smiles
and
frowns
and
to
start
scandalous
gossip
concerning
her
in
the
servants
hall
from
whence
it
gradually
spreads
to
the
society
newspapers
for
do
you
think
these
estimable
and
popular
journals
are
never
indebted
for
their
reliable
information
to
the
honest
statements
of
discharged
footman
or
valet
briggs
for
instance
had
tried
his
hand
at
a
paragraph
or
two
concerning
the
upper
ten
and
with
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
had
succeeded
in
expressing
himself
quite
smartly
though
in
ordinary
conversation
his
h
were
often
lacking
or
superfluous
and
his
grammar
doubtful
whether
he
persuaded
any
editor
to
accept
his
literary
efforts
is
quite
another
matter
a
question
to
which
the
answer
must
remain
for
ever
enveloped
in
mystery
but
if
he
appear
in
print
it
is
only
an
if
he
must
have
been
immensely
gratified
to
consider
that
his
statements
were
received
with
gusto
by
at
least
half
aristocratic
london
and
implicitly
believed
as
having
emanated
from
the
best
authorities
and
louise
rénaud
having
posted
her
mistress
letter
at
last
went
down
to
visit
briggs
in
his
private
pantry
and
to
ask
him
a
question
tell
me
she
said
rapidly
with
her
tight
prim
smile
you
read
the
papers
you
will
know
what
lady
is
that
of
the
theatres
violet
vere
briggs
laid
down
the
paper
he
was
perusing
and
surveyed
her
with
a
superior
air
what
vi
he
exclaimed
with
a
lazy
wink
vi
of
the
you
of
surely
mamzelle
no
there
not
a
man
as
is
worth
calling
a
man
about
town
as
do
know
dukes
lords
an
royal
she
the
style
for
creetur
all
legs
and
arms
i
wo
deny
but
wot
i
an
admiration
for
myself
i
bought
a
portrait
of
quite
recently
and
briggs
rose
slowly
and
searched
in
a
mysterious
drawer
which
he
invariably
kept
locked
she
is
as
large
as
life
mamzelle
he
continued
exhibiting
a
promenade
photograph
of
the
actress
in
question
there
a
neck
for
you
there
form
vi
my
dear
i
saloot
you
and
he
pressed
a
sounding
kiss
on
the
picture
you
one
in
a
million
smokes
and
drinks
like
a
trooper
mamzelle
he
added
admiringly
as
louise
rénaud
studied
the
portrait
attentively
but
with
all
advantages
you
would
not
call
a
lady
no
that
term
would
be
out
of
the
question
she
is
wot
we
men
would
call
an
enchantin
female
and
briggs
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
waved
them
in
the
air
as
he
had
seen
certain
foreign
gentlemen
do
when
enthusiastic
i
comprehend
said
the
french
maid
nodding
emphatically
then
if
she
is
so
what
makes
that
proud
seigneur
visit
her
here
she
shook
her
finger
at
briggs
and
leave
his
beautiful
lady
wife
to
go
and
see
her
another
shake
and
that
sieur
lennox
to
go
also
tell
me
that
she
folded
her
arms
like
napoleon
at
helena
and
smiled
again
that
smile
which
was
nothing
but
a
sneer
briggs
rubbed
his
nose
contemplatively
little
francis
can
go
ennywheres
he
said
at
last
he
laid
out
a
good
deal
of
tin
on
vi
and
others
of
purfession
you
can
not
make
of
that
young
feller
but
a
cad
i
would
not
accept
for
my
pussonal
attendant
no
but
sir
philip
he
paused
then
continued
air
you
sure
of
your
facts
mamzelle
mamzelle
was
so
sure
that
the
bow
on
her
cap
threatened
to
come
off
with
the
determined
wagging
of
her
head
well
resumed
briggs
sir
philip
may
like
hothers
consider
it
thing
you
know
to
on
as
it
were
to
vi
but
i
thought
superior
to
it
ah
poor
natur
as
says
and
briggs
sighed
lady
errington
is
a
sweet
creetur
mamzelle
a
sweet
creetur
a
rule
i
find
the
merest
nod
of
my
a
sufficient
saloot
to
a
woman
of
the
aristocracy
but
for
mamzelle
i
never
fail
to
show
up
with
a
court
bow
and
involuntarily
briggs
bowed
then
and
there
in
his
most
elegant
manner
mamzelle
tightened
her
thin
lips
a
little
and
waved
her
hand
expressively
she
is
an
angel
of
beauty
she
said
and
miladi
winsleigh
is
jealous
ah
jealous
to
death
of
her
she
is
innocent
too
like
a
baby
and
she
worships
her
husband
that
is
an
error
to
worship
a
man
is
a
great
mistake
she
will
find
it
so
men
are
not
to
be
too
much
loved
no
no
briggs
smiled
in
superb
well
well
i
will
not
deny
mamzelle
that
it
spoils
us
he
said
complacently
it
certainly
spoils
us
lovely
woman
stoops
to
folly
the
hold
hold
story
you
will
said
mamzelle
suddenly
stepping
up
very
close
to
him
and
speaking
with
a
strong
accent
what
i
have
said
monsieur
briggs
you
will
there
will
be
yes
there
will
be
to
sieur
and
when
there
is
i
i
louise
rénaud
i
know
who
ees
at
the
bottom
of
eet
so
saying
with
a
whirl
of
her
black
silk
dress
and
a
flash
of
her
white
muslin
apron
she
disappeared
briggs
left
alone
sauntered
to
a
hanging
on
the
wall
and
studied
with
some
solicitude
a
pimple
that
had
recently
appeared
on
his
face
mischief
he
soliloquized
i
whenever
a
lot
of
women
gets
together
there
sure
to
be
mischief
dear
creeturs
they
love
it
like
the
best
clicquot
sprightly
young
pusson
is
mamzelle
knows
who
at
the
bottom
of
does
she
well
she
not
the
only
one
as
knows
the
same
thing
as
long
as
doors
cracks
and
it
ai
in
the
least
difficult
to
find
out
wot
goes
on
inside
and
and
interestin
things
one
now
and
then
interestin
and
briggs
leered
suavely
at
his
own
reflection
and
then
resumed
the
perusal
of
his
paper
he
was
absorbed
in
the
piquant
highly
flavored
details
of
a
particularly
disgraceful
divorce
case
and
he
was
by
no
means
likely
to
disturb
himself
from
his
refined
enjoyment
for
any
less
important
reason
than
the
summons
of
lord
winsleigh
bell
which
rang
so
seldom
that
when
it
did
he
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
answer
it
immediately
for
as
he
said
his
lordship
knows
wot
is
due
to
me
and
i
knows
wot
is
due
to
therefore
it
we
are
able
to
ekally
respect
each
other
chapter
xxii
if
thou
wert
honorable
thou
have
told
this
tale
for
virtue
not
for
such
an
end
thou
as
base
as
strange
thou
a
gentleman
who
is
as
far
from
thy
report
as
thou
from
honor
summer
in
shakespeare
land
summer
in
the
heart
of
england
summer
in
wooded
warwickshire
a
summer
brilliant
warm
radiant
with
flowers
melodious
with
the
songs
of
the
heaven
aspiring
larks
and
the
sweet
low
trill
of
the
nightingales
wonderful
and
divine
it
is
to
hear
the
wild
chorus
of
nightingales
that
sing
beside
como
in
the
hot
languorous
nights
of
an
italian
july
wonderful
to
hear
them
maddening
themselves
with
love
and
music
and
almost
splitting
their
slender
throats
with
the
bursting
bubbles
of
burning
song
but
there
is
something
perhaps
more
dreamily
enchanting
still
to
hear
them
warbling
less
passionately
but
more
plaintively
beneath
the
drooping
leafage
of
those
grand
old
trees
some
of
which
may
have
stretched
their
branches
in
shadowy
benediction
over
the
sacred
head
of
the
grandest
poet
in
the
world
why
travel
to
athens
why
wander
among
the
ionian
isles
for
love
of
the
classic
ground
surely
though
the
old
greeks
were
the
founders
of
all
noble
literature
they
have
reached
their
fulminating
point
in
the
english
shakespeare
and
the
warwickshire
lanes
decked
simply
with
hawthorn
and
roses
through
which
mary
arden
walked
leading
her
by
the
hand
are
sacred
as
any
portion
of
that
earth
once
trodden
by
the
feet
of
homer
and
plato
so
at
least
thelma
thought
when
released
from
the
bondage
of
london
social
life
she
found
herself
once
more
at
errington
manor
then
looking
its
loveliest
surrounded
with
a
green
girdle
of
oak
and
beech
and
set
off
by
the
beauty
of
velvety
lawns
and
terraces
and
in
full
bloom
the
depression
from
which
she
had
suffered
fell
away
from
her
completely
she
grew
as
a
child
and
flitted
from
room
to
room
singing
to
herself
for
pure
gladness
philip
was
with
her
all
day
now
save
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
forenoon
which
he
devoted
to
in
connection
with
his
parliamentary
aspirations
and
philip
was
tender
adoring
and
passionate
as
lovers
may
be
but
as
husbands
seldom
are
they
took
long
walks
together
through
the
woods
they
often
rambled
across
the
fragrant
fields
to
anne
hathaway
cottage
which
was
not
very
far
away
and
sitting
down
in
some
sequestered
nook
philip
would
pull
from
his
pocket
a
volume
of
the
immortal
plays
and
read
passages
aloud
in
his
fine
mellow
voice
while
thelma
making
posies
of
the
meadow
flowers
listened
entranced
sometimes
when
he
was
in
a
more
humor
he
would
bring
out
cicero
orations
and
after
pondering
over
them
for
a
while
would
talk
very
grandly
about
the
way
in
which
he
meant
to
speak
in
parliament
they
want
dash
and
fire
there
he
said
and
these
qualities
must
be
united
with
good
common
sense
in
addressing
the
house
you
see
thelma
one
must
rouse
and
interest
the
men
not
bore
them
you
ca
expect
fellows
to
pass
a
bill
if
you
made
them
long
for
their
beds
all
the
time
you
been
talking
about
it
thelma
smiled
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
cicero
orations
and
do
you
wish
to
speak
to
them
like
cicero
my
boy
she
said
gently
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
find
that
possible
because
when
cicero
spoke
it
was
in
a
different
age
and
to
very
different
people
people
who
were
glad
to
learn
how
to
be
wise
and
brave
but
if
you
were
cicero
himself
do
you
think
you
would
be
able
to
impress
the
english
parliament
why
not
dear
asked
errington
with
some
fervor
i
believe
that
men
taken
as
men
et
are
the
same
in
all
ages
and
are
open
to
the
same
impressions
why
should
not
modern
englishmen
be
capable
of
receiving
the
same
lofty
ideas
as
the
antique
romans
and
acting
upon
them
ah
do
not
ask
why
said
thelma
with
a
plaintive
little
shake
of
her
head
for
can
not
tell
you
but
remember
how
many
members
of
parliament
we
did
meet
in
london
and
where
were
their
lofty
ideas
philip
had
they
any
ideas
at
all
do
you
think
there
was
that
very
fat
gentleman
who
is
a
brewer
well
to
hear
him
talk
would
you
not
think
all
england
was
for
the
making
of
beer
and
he
does
not
care
for
the
country
unless
it
continues
to
consume
his
beer
it
was
to
that
very
man
i
said
something
about
and
he
told
me
he
had
no
interest
for
such
nonsense
as
shakespeare
and
his
time
was
taken
up
at
the
you
see
he
is
a
member
of
parliament
yet
it
is
evident
he
neither
knows
the
language
nor
the
literature
of
his
country
and
there
must
be
many
like
him
otherwise
so
ignorant
a
person
would
not
hold
such
a
position
and
for
such
men
what
would
be
the
use
of
a
cicero
philip
leaned
back
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
under
which
they
were
sitting
and
laughed
you
may
be
right
thelma
i
dare
say
you
are
there
certainly
too
much
beer
represented
in
the
house
i
admit
that
but
after
all
trade
is
the
great
of
national
prosperity
and
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
refuse
seats
to
the
very
men
who
help
to
keep
the
country
going
i
do
not
see
that
said
thelma
gravely
if
those
men
are
ignorant
why
should
they
have
a
share
in
so
important
a
thing
as
government
they
may
know
all
about
beer
and
wool
and
iron
but
perhaps
they
can
only
judge
what
is
good
for
themselves
not
what
is
best
for
the
whole
country
with
all
its
rich
and
poor
i
do
think
that
only
the
wisest
scholars
and
most
intelligent
persons
should
be
allowed
to
help
in
the
ruling
of
a
great
nation
but
the
people
choose
their
own
rulers
remarked
errington
reflectively
ah
the
poor
people
sighed
thelma
they
know
so
very
little
and
they
are
taught
so
badly
i
think
they
never
do
quite
understand
what
they
do
want
they
are
the
same
in
all
histories
like
little
children
they
get
bewildered
and
frightened
in
any
trouble
and
the
wisest
heads
are
needed
to
think
for
them
it
is
indeed
most
cruel
to
make
them
puzzle
out
all
difficulty
for
themselves
what
a
little
sage
you
are
my
pet
laughed
philip
taking
her
hand
on
which
the
and
its
accompanying
diamond
circlet
glistened
brilliantly
in
the
warm
sunlight
do
you
mean
to
go
in
for
politics
she
shook
her
head
no
indeed
that
is
not
woman
work
at
all
the
only
way
in
which
i
think
about
such
things
is
that
i
feel
the
people
can
not
all
be
wise
and
that
it
seems
a
pity
the
wisest
and
greatest
in
the
land
should
not
be
chosen
to
lead
them
rightly
and
so
under
the
circumstances
you
think
it
no
use
my
trying
to
as
a
cicero
asked
her
husband
amusedly
she
laughed
with
a
very
tender
cadence
in
her
laughter
it
would
not
be
worth
your
while
my
boy
she
said
you
know
i
have
often
told
you
that
i
do
not
see
any
great
distinction
in
being
a
member
of
parliament
at
all
what
will
you
do
you
will
talk
to
the
fat
brewer
perhaps
and
he
will
contradict
you
then
other
people
will
get
up
and
talk
and
contradict
each
other
and
so
it
will
go
on
for
days
and
days
meanwhile
the
country
remains
exactly
as
it
was
neither
better
nor
worse
and
all
the
talking
does
no
good
it
is
better
to
be
out
of
it
here
together
as
we
are
and
she
raised
her
dreamy
blue
eyes
to
the
sheltering
canopy
of
green
leaves
that
overhung
them
leaves
and
dewy
through
which
the
dazzling
sky
peeped
in
radiant
patches
philip
looked
at
her
the
rapt
expression
of
her
upward
gaze
the
calm
untroubled
sweetness
of
her
fair
face
were
such
as
might
well
have
suited
one
of
raffaelle
divinest
angels
his
heart
beat
quickly
he
drew
closer
to
her
and
put
his
arm
round
her
your
eyes
are
looking
at
the
sky
thelma
he
whispered
do
you
know
what
that
is
heaven
looking
into
heaven
and
do
you
know
which
of
the
two
heavens
i
prefer
she
smiled
and
turning
met
his
ardent
gaze
with
one
of
equal
passion
and
tenderness
ah
you
know
he
went
on
softly
kissing
the
side
of
her
slim
white
throat
i
thought
you
could
possibly
make
a
mistake
he
rested
his
head
against
her
shoulder
and
after
a
minute
or
two
of
lazy
comfort
he
resumed
you
are
not
ambitious
my
thelma
you
do
seem
to
care
whether
your
husband
distinguishes
himself
in
the
as
our
friend
the
brewer
calls
it
or
not
in
fact
i
do
believe
you
care
for
anything
save
love
am
i
not
right
my
wife
a
wave
of
rosy
color
flushed
her
transparent
skin
and
her
eyes
filled
with
an
earnest
almost
pathetic
languor
surely
of
all
things
in
the
world
she
said
in
a
low
tone
love
is
best
to
this
he
made
prompt
answer
though
not
in
words
his
lips
conversed
with
hers
in
that
strange
sweet
language
which
though
unwritten
is
everywhere
comprehensible
and
then
they
left
their
shady
and
sauntered
homeward
hand
in
hand
through
the
warm
fields
fragrant
with
wild
thyme
and
clover
many
happy
days
passed
thus
with
these
lovers
for
lovers
they
still
were
marriage
had
for
once
fulfilled
its
real
and
sacred
meaning
it
had
set
love
free
from
restraint
and
had
opened
all
the
gateways
of
the
only
earthly
paradise
human
hearts
shall
ever
know
the
paradise
of
perfect
union
and
absolute
sympathy
with
the
one
thing
beloved
on
this
side
eternity
the
golden
hours
fled
by
all
too
rapidly
and
towards
the
close
of
august
there
came
an
interruption
to
their
felicity
courtesy
had
compelled
and
his
wife
to
invite
a
few
friends
down
to
visit
them
at
the
manor
before
the
glory
of
the
was
past
and
first
among
the
guests
came
lord
and
lady
winsleigh
and
their
bright
boy
ernest
her
ladyship
maid
louise
rénaud
of
course
accompanied
her
ladyship
and
briggs
was
also
to
the
fore
in
the
capacity
of
lord
winsleigh
personal
attendant
after
these
george
lorimer
arrived
he
had
avoided
the
erringtons
all
the
season
but
he
could
not
very
well
refuse
the
pressing
invitation
now
given
him
without
seeming
churlish
then
came
beau
lovelace
for
a
few
days
only
as
with
the
commencement
of
september
he
would
be
off
as
usual
to
his
villa
on
the
lago
di
como
sir
francis
lennox
too
made
his
appearance
frequently
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
he
ran
down
to
use
his
own
expression
now
and
then
and
made
himself
very
agreeable
especially
to
men
by
whom
he
was
well
liked
for
his
invariable
and
extraordinary
proficiency
in
all
sports
and
games
of
skill
another
welcome
visitor
was
pierre
duprèz
lively
and
sparkling
as
ever
he
came
from
paris
to
pass
a
fortnight
with
his
cher
and
make
merriment
for
the
whole
party
his
old
admiration
for
britta
had
by
no
means
decreased
he
was
fond
of
waylaying
that
demure
little
maiden
on
her
various
household
errands
and
giving
her
small
posies
of
jessamine
and
other
blossoms
to
wear
just
above
the
corner
of
her
close
to
the
place
where
the
heart
is
supposed
to
be
olaf
güldmar
had
been
invited
to
the
manor
at
this
period
errington
wrote
many
urgent
letters
and
so
did
thelma
entreating
him
to
come
for
nothing
would
have
pleased
sir
philip
more
than
to
have
introduced
the
fine
old
odin
worshipper
among
his
fashionable
friends
and
to
have
heard
him
bluntly
and
forcibly
holding
his
own
among
them
putting
their
feint
and
languid
ways
of
life
to
shame
by
his
manly
honest
and
vigorous
utterance
but
güldmar
had
only
just
returned
to
the
altenfjord
after
nearly
a
year
absence
and
his
hands
were
too
full
of
work
for
him
to
accept
his
invitation
the
farm
lands
have
a
waste
and
dreary
look
he
wrote
though
i
let
them
to
a
man
who
should
verily
have
known
how
to
till
the
soil
trodden
by
his
fathers
and
as
for
the
farmhouse
was
like
a
hollow
shell
that
has
lain
long
on
the
shore
and
become
brown
and
brittle
for
thou
knowest
no
human
creature
has
entered
there
since
we
departed
however
valdemar
svensen
and
i
for
sake
of
company
have
resolved
to
dwell
together
in
it
and
truly
we
have
nearly
settled
down
to
the
peaceful
contemplation
of
our
past
days
so
philip
and
thou
my
child
thelma
trouble
not
concerning
me
i
am
hale
and
hearty
the
gods
be
thanked
and
may
live
on
in
hope
to
see
you
both
next
spring
or
your
happiness
keeps
this
old
man
young
so
grudge
me
not
the
news
of
your
delights
wherein
i
am
myself
delighted
one
familiar
figure
was
missing
from
the
manor
household
that
of
edward
neville
since
the
night
at
the
brilliant
when
he
had
left
the
theatre
so
suddenly
and
gone
home
on
the
plea
of
illness
he
had
never
been
quite
the
same
man
he
looked
years
older
he
was
strangely
nervous
and
timid
and
he
shrank
away
from
thelma
as
though
he
were
some
guilty
or
tainted
creature
surprised
at
this
she
spoke
to
her
husband
about
it
but
he
hurriedly
and
with
some
embarrassment
advised
her
to
let
him
alone
his
nerves
were
shaken
his
health
was
feeble
and
that
it
would
be
kind
on
her
part
to
refrain
from
noticing
him
or
asking
him
questions
so
she
refrained
but
neville
behavior
puzzled
her
all
the
same
when
they
left
town
he
implored
almost
piteously
to
be
allowed
to
remain
behind
he
could
attend
to
sir
philip
business
so
much
better
in
london
he
declared
and
he
had
his
way
errington
usually
fond
of
neville
society
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
persuade
him
against
his
will
so
he
stayed
in
the
house
in
gate
through
all
the
summer
heat
poring
over
parliamentary
documents
and
pamphlets
and
philip
came
up
from
the
country
once
a
fortnight
to
visit
him
and
transact
any
business
that
might
require
his
personal
attention
on
one
of
the
last
and
hottest
days
in
august
a
grand
was
given
at
the
manor
all
the
county
people
were
invited
and
they
came
eagerly
though
before
thelma
social
successes
in
london
they
had
been
reluctant
to
meet
her
now
they
put
on
their
best
clothes
and
precipitated
themselves
into
the
manor
grounds
like
a
flock
of
sheep
seeking
land
on
which
to
graze
all
wearing
their
sweetest
propitiatory
smirk
all
gushing
forth
their
admiration
of
that
lady
errington
all
behaving
themselves
in
the
exceptionally
funny
manner
that
county
people
affect
people
who
are
considered
somebodies
in
the
small
villages
their
big
houses
dominate
but
who
when
brought
to
reside
in
london
become
less
than
the
minnows
in
a
vast
ocean
these
good
folks
were
not
only
anxious
to
lady
errington
they
wanted
to
they
had
seen
her
and
that
she
had
spoken
to
so
that
they
might
in
talking
to
their
neighbors
mention
it
in
quite
an
easy
casual
way
such
as
oh
i
was
at
errington
manor
the
other
day
and
lady
errington
said
to
me
or
sir
philip
is
a
charming
man
i
was
talking
to
his
lovely
wife
and
he
asked
me
etc
or
you
no
idea
what
large
strawberries
they
grow
at
the
manor
lady
errington
showed
me
some
that
were
just
ripening
magnificent
and
so
on
for
in
truth
this
a
mad
world
my
masters
and
there
is
no
accounting
for
the
inexpressibly
small
follies
and
mean
toadyisms
of
the
people
in
it
moreover
all
the
london
guests
who
were
visiting
thelma
came
in
for
a
share
of
the
county
magnates
servile
admiration
they
found
the
winsleighs
so
distingué
master
ernest
instantly
became
that
boy
beau
lovelace
was
so
dreadfully
clever
you
know
and
pierre
duprèz
quite
delightful
the
grounds
looked
very
brilliant
marquees
were
dotted
here
and
there
on
the
smooth
velvet
lawns
bright
flags
waved
from
different
quarters
of
the
gardens
signals
of
tennis
archery
and
dancing
and
the
voluptuous
of
a
fine
hungarian
band
rose
up
and
swayed
in
the
air
with
the
downward
floating
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
dash
of
fountains
in
full
play
girls
in
pretty
light
summer
costumes
made
picturesque
groups
under
the
stately
oaks
and
beeches
gay
laughter
echoed
from
the
leafy
shrubberies
and
stray
couples
were
seen
sauntering
meditatively
through
the
treading
on
the
fallen
scented
petals
and
apparently
too
much
absorbed
in
each
other
to
notice
anything
that
was
going
on
around
them
most
of
these
were
lovers
of
course
intending
lovers
if
not
declared
ones
in
fact
eros
was
very
busy
that
day
among
the
roses
and
shot
forth
a
great
many
arrows
aptly
aimed
out
of
his
exhaustless
quiver
two
persons
there
were
however
man
and
woman
who
walking
in
that
same
did
not
seem
from
their
manner
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
fair
greek
god
they
were
lady
winsleigh
and
sir
francis
lennox
her
ladyship
looked
exceedingly
beautiful
in
her
clinging
dress
of
madras
lace
with
a
bunch
of
scarlet
poppies
at
her
breast
and
a
wreath
of
the
same
vivid
flowers
in
her
picturesque
leghorn
hat
she
held
a
parasol
over
her
head
and
from
under
the
protecting
shadow
of
this
silken
pavilion
her
dark
lustrous
eyes
flashed
disdainfully
as
she
regarded
her
companion
he
was
biting
an
end
of
his
brown
moustache
and
looked
annoyed
yet
lazily
amused
too
upon
my
life
clara
he
observed
you
are
really
awfully
down
on
a
fellow
you
know
one
would
think
you
never
cared
about
me
too
high
a
figure
retorted
lady
winsleigh
with
a
hard
little
laugh
i
never
cared
a
brass
farthing
he
stopped
short
in
his
walk
and
stared
at
her
by
jove
you
cool
he
ejaculated
then
what
did
you
mean
all
the
time
what
did
mean
she
asked
defiantly
he
was
silent
after
a
slight
uncomfortable
pause
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
do
let
us
have
a
scene
he
observed
in
a
bantering
tone
anything
but
that
scene
she
exclaimed
indignantly
pray
when
have
you
had
to
complain
of
me
on
that
score
well
do
let
me
have
to
complain
now
he
said
coolly
she
surveyed
him
in
silent
scorn
for
a
moment
and
her
full
crimson
lips
curled
contemptuously
what
a
brute
you
are
she
muttered
suddenly
between
her
set
pearly
teeth
thanks
awfully
he
answered
taking
out
a
cigarette
and
lighting
it
leisurely
you
are
really
charmingly
candid
clara
almost
as
frank
as
lady
errington
only
less
polite
i
shall
not
learn
politeness
from
at
any
rate
she
said
then
altering
her
tone
to
one
of
studied
indifference
she
continued
coldly
what
do
you
want
of
me
we
done
with
each
other
as
you
know
i
believe
you
wish
to
become
to
wife
and
that
you
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
the
situation
shall
i
give
you
a
character
he
flushed
darkly
and
his
eyes
glittered
with
an
evil
lustre
gently
clara
draw
it
mild
he
said
languidly
do
irritate
me
or
i
turn
crusty
you
know
if
i
chose
i
could
open
eyes
rather
more
widely
than
you
like
with
respect
to
the
you
entertain
for
his
beautiful
wife
she
winced
a
little
at
this
observation
he
saw
it
and
laughed
then
resumed
at
present
i
really
in
the
best
of
humors
the
reason
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
minute
or
two
was
that
i
something
to
say
which
might
possibly
please
you
but
perhaps
you
rather
not
hear
it
she
was
silent
so
was
he
he
watched
her
closely
for
a
little
noting
with
complacency
the
indignant
heaving
of
her
breast
and
the
flush
on
her
cheeks
signs
of
the
strong
repression
she
was
putting
upon
her
rising
temper
come
clara
you
may
as
well
be
amiable
he
said
i
sure
you
be
glad
to
know
that
the
virtuous
philip
is
not
immaculate
after
all
it
comfort
you
to
think
that
he
nothing
but
a
mortal
man
like
the
rest
of
us
and
that
with
a
little
patience
your
charms
will
most
probably
prevail
with
him
as
easily
as
they
once
did
with
me
is
that
worth
hearing
i
do
understand
you
she
replied
curtly
then
you
are
very
dense
my
dear
girl
he
remarked
smilingly
pardon
me
for
saying
so
but
i
put
it
plainly
and
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
moral
like
a
great
many
other
men
i
know
has
gone
in
for
violet
vere
and
i
dare
say
you
understand
what
means
in
the
simplest
language
it
means
that
he
tired
of
his
domestic
bliss
and
wants
a
change
lady
winsleigh
stopped
in
her
slow
pacing
along
the
and
raised
her
eyes
steadily
to
her
companion
face
are
you
sure
of
this
she
asked
positive
replied
sir
francis
flicking
the
light
ash
off
his
cigarette
delicately
with
his
little
finger
when
you
wrote
me
that
note
about
the
vere
i
confess
i
had
my
suspicions
since
then
been
confirmed
i
know
for
a
fact
that
errington
has
had
several
private
interviews
with
vi
and
has
also
written
her
a
good
many
letters
some
of
the
fellows
in
the
tease
her
about
her
new
conquest
and
she
grins
and
admits
it
oh
the
whole
thing
plain
enough
only
last
week
when
he
went
up
to
town
to
see
his
man
neville
on
business
he
called
on
vi
at
her
own
apartments
in
arundel
street
strand
she
told
me
so
herself
we
rather
intimate
you
know
though
of
course
she
refused
to
mention
the
object
of
his
visit
honor
among
thieves
and
he
smiled
half
mockingly
lady
winsleigh
seemed
absorbed
and
walked
on
like
one
in
a
dream
just
then
a
bend
in
the
avenue
brought
them
in
full
view
of
the
broad
terrace
in
front
of
the
manor
where
thelma
graceful
figure
in
a
robe
of
white
silk
crepe
was
outlined
clearly
against
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
sky
several
people
were
grouped
near
her
she
seemed
to
be
in
animated
conversation
with
some
of
them
and
her
face
was
radiant
with
smiles
lady
winsleigh
looked
at
her
then
said
suddenly
in
a
low
voice
it
will
break
her
heart
sir
francis
assumed
an
air
of
polite
surprise
pardon
whose
heart
she
pointed
slightly
to
the
white
figure
on
the
terrace
hers
surely
you
must
know
that
he
smiled
well
is
that
precisely
what
you
desire
clara
though
for
my
part
i
do
believe
in
the
brittleness
of
hearts
they
seem
to
me
to
be
made
of
exceptionally
tough
material
however
if
the
fair
thelma
heart
cracks
ever
so
widely
i
think
i
can
undertake
to
mend
it
clara
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
she
exclaimed
contemptuously
he
stroked
his
moustache
with
feline
care
and
nicety
yes
i
if
not
i
studied
women
all
my
life
for
nothing
she
broke
into
a
low
peal
of
mocking
laughter
turned
and
was
about
to
leave
him
when
he
detained
her
by
a
slight
touch
on
her
arm
stop
a
bit
he
said
in
an
impressive
a
bargain
a
bargain
all
the
world
over
if
i
undertake
to
keep
you
cognizant
of
little
in
london
information
which
i
dare
say
you
can
turn
to
good
account
you
must
do
something
for
me
i
ask
very
little
speak
of
me
to
lady
errington
make
her
think
well
of
me
flatter
me
as
much
as
you
used
to
do
when
we
fancied
ourselves
terrifically
in
love
with
each
other
a
good
joke
was
it
and
above
all
make
her
me
do
you
understand
as
red
trusted
the
wolf
and
was
eaten
up
for
her
innocence
observed
lady
winsleigh
very
well
i
do
my
best
as
i
said
before
you
want
a
character
i
sure
i
hope
you
obtain
the
situation
you
so
much
desire
i
can
state
that
you
made
yourself
fairly
useful
in
your
last
place
and
that
you
left
because
your
wages
were
not
high
enough
and
with
another
sarcastic
laugh
she
moved
forward
towards
the
terrace
where
thelma
stood
sir
francis
followed
at
some
little
distance
with
no
very
pleasant
expression
on
his
features
a
stealthy
step
approaching
him
front
behind
made
him
start
nervously
it
was
louise
rénaud
who
carrying
a
silver
tray
on
which
bottles
and
glasses
made
an
agreeable
clinking
tripped
demurely
past
him
without
raising
her
eyes
she
came
directly
out
of
the
and
as
she
overtook
her
mistress
on
the
lawn
that
lady
seemed
surprised
and
asked
where
have
you
been
louise
miladi
was
willing
that
i
should
assist
in
the
attendance
replied
louise
discreetly
i
have
waited
upon
milord
winsleigh
and
other
gentlemen
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
and
with
one
furtive
glance
of
her
black
eyes
at
lady
winsleigh
face
she
made
a
respectful
sort
of
and
went
her
way
later
on
in
the
afternoon
when
it
was
nearing
sunset
and
all
other
amusements
had
given
way
to
the
delight
of
dancing
on
the
springy
green
turf
to
the
swinging
music
of
the
band
briggs
released
for
a
time
from
the
duties
of
assisting
the
waiters
at
the
splendid
duties
which
were
pleasantly
lightened
by
the
drinking
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
which
he
was
careful
to
reserve
for
his
own
consumption
sauntered
leisurely
through
the
winding
alleys
and
fragrant
shrubberies
which
led
to
the
most
unromantic
portion
of
the
manor
grounds
namely
the
here
none
of
the
butterflies
of
fashion
found
their
way
the
suggestions
offered
by
growing
cabbages
turnips
beans
and
plump
marrows
were
too
prosaic
for
society
bantams
who
require
refined
surroundings
in
which
to
crow
their
assertive
platitudes
yet
it
was
a
peaceful
nook
and
there
were
household
odors
of
mint
and
thyme
and
sweet
marjoram
which
were
pleasant
to
the
soul
of
briggs
and
reminded
him
of
roast
goose
on
christmas
day
with
all
its
attendant
succulent
delicacies
he
paced
the
path
slowly
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
blazing
gloriously
on
his
plush
breeches
silver
cordons
and
tassels
for
he
was
in
livery
in
honor
of
the
fête
and
looked
exceedingly
imposing
now
and
then
he
glanced
down
at
his
calves
with
mild
approval
his
silk
stockings
fitted
them
well
and
they
had
a
very
neat
and
shapely
appearance
i
developed
he
murmured
to
himself
there
ai
a
doubt
about
it
one
week
of
country
air
and
i
a
different
man
the
effecks
of
overwork
disappeared
flopsie
wo
know
these
legs
of
mine
when
i
get
back
they
improved
surprisingly
he
stopped
to
survey
a
bed
of
carrots
plenty
of
cressy
there
he
mused
cressy
a
noble
soup
and
flopsie
makes
it
well
a
man
might
do
wuss
than
marry
flopsie
she
a
widder
and
a
old
just
a
leetle
old
for
me
but
here
he
sniffed
delicately
at
a
sprig
of
thyme
he
had
gathered
and
smiled
consciously
presently
he
perceived
a
small
plump
pretty
figure
approaching
him
no
other
than
britta
looking
particularly
charming
in
a
very
smart
cap
adorned
with
bows
and
a
very
elaborately
frilled
muslin
apron
briggs
at
once
assumed
his
most
elegant
and
conquering
air
straightened
himself
to
his
full
height
and
kissed
his
hand
to
her
with
much
condescension
she
laughed
as
she
came
up
to
him
and
the
dimples
in
her
round
cheeks
appeared
in
full
force
well
briggs
she
said
are
you
enjoying
yourself
briggs
smiled
down
upon
her
benevolently
i
am
he
responded
graciously
i
find
the
hair
refreshing
and
you
miss
britta
oh
i
very
comfortable
thank
you
responded
britta
demurely
edging
a
little
away
from
his
arm
which
showed
an
unmistakable
tendency
to
encircle
her
waist
then
glancing
at
a
basket
she
held
full
of
grapes
just
cut
from
the
hot
house
she
continued
these
are
for
the
i
must
be
quick
and
take
them
to
mrs
parton
must
you
and
briggs
asked
this
question
with
quite
an
unnecessary
amount
of
tenderness
then
resuming
his
dignity
he
observed
parton
is
a
very
worthy
woman
an
excellent
but
she
no
doubt
excuse
you
for
lingering
a
little
miss
britta
especially
in
company
britta
laughed
again
showing
her
pretty
little
white
teeth
to
the
best
advantage
do
you
think
she
will
she
said
merrily
then
i
stop
a
minute
and
if
she
scolds
me
i
put
the
blame
on
you
briggs
played
with
his
silver
tassels
and
leaning
gracefully
against
a
surveyed
her
with
a
critical
eye
i
was
not
able
he
observed
to
see
much
of
you
in
town
our
people
were
always
a
visitin
each
other
and
yet
our
meetings
were
as
the
poet
says
and
far
between
britta
nodded
indifferently
and
perceiving
a
particularly
ripe
gooseberry
on
one
of
the
bushes
close
to
her
gathered
it
quickly
and
popped
it
between
her
rosy
lips
seeing
another
equally
ripe
she
offered
it
to
briggs
who
accepted
it
and
ate
it
slowly
though
he
had
a
misgiving
that
by
so
doing
he
was
seriously
compromising
his
dignity
he
resumed
his
conversation
since
i
been
down
i
more
opportunity
to
observe
you
i
you
will
allow
me
to
say
i
think
very
highly
of
you
he
waved
his
hand
with
the
elegance
of
a
sir
charles
grandison
very
indeed
your
youth
is
most
becoming
to
you
if
you
only
a
little
more
there
be
nothing
left
to
desire
a
little
more
asked
britta
opening
her
blue
eyes
very
wide
in
puzzled
amusement
replied
briggs
with
persistent
persuasiveness
miss
britta
is
a
french
word
much
used
by
the
aristocracy
coming
from
norway
an
perhaps
a
very
limited
experience
you
may
it
but
eddicated
people
find
it
very
convenient
and
expressive
means
style
thing
go
fashion
for
example
everything
your
lady
wears
is
really
said
britta
with
a
wandering
and
innocent
air
how
funny
it
does
sound
like
french
at
all
briggs
it
more
like
english
perhaps
the
paris
accent
is
familiar
to
you
yet
remarked
briggs
majestically
your
stay
in
the
gay
metropolis
was
probably
short
now
i
been
there
many
times
ah
paris
paris
he
paused
in
a
sort
of
ecstacy
then
with
a
side
leer
continued
you
believe
wicked
i
am
in
paris
miss
britta
i
am
indeed
it
is
something
in
the
hair
of
the
bollyvards
i
suppose
and
the
caffy
life
excites
my
nerves
then
you
should
go
there
said
britta
gravely
though
her
eyes
twinkled
with
repressed
fun
it
ca
be
good
for
you
and
oh
i
so
sorry
briggs
to
think
that
are
ever
wicked
and
she
laughed
it
not
for
long
explained
briggs
with
a
comically
satisfied
yet
penitent
look
it
is
only
a
sort
of
breaking
out
a
fit
of
spirits
hall
men
are
so
at
times
it
to
run
a
little
wild
in
paris
but
miss
britta
if
were
with
me
i
should
never
run
wild
here
his
arm
made
another
attempt
to
get
round
her
waist
and
again
she
skillfully
and
with
some
show
of
anger
avoided
it
ah
you
very
upon
me
he
then
observed
very
very
but
i
wo
complain
my
my
dear
gal
one
day
you
know
me
better
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
very
intently
miss
britta
he
said
abruptly
you
a
great
affection
for
your
lady
you
instantly
britta
face
flushed
and
she
was
all
attention
yes
indeed
she
answered
quickly
why
do
you
ask
mr
briggs
briggs
rubbed
his
nose
perplexedly
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
he
said
to
run
down
my
own
employers
would
be
in
my
line
but
i
an
idea
that
clara
by
which
name
i
allude
to
my
lord
winsleigh
lady
is
up
to
mischief
she
lady
miss
britta
like
poison
hates
her
cried
britta
in
astonishment
oh
you
must
be
mistaken
briggs
she
is
as
fond
of
her
as
she
can
be
almost
like
a
sister
to
her
clara
a
fine
actress
murmured
briggs
more
to
himself
than
to
his
companion
she
beat
violet
vere
on
own
ground
raising
his
voice
a
little
he
turned
gallantly
to
britta
and
relieved
her
of
the
basket
she
held
hallow
me
he
said
we
walk
to
the
together
on
the
way
explain
and
you
judge
for
yourself
the
words
of
the
immortal
bard
whose
county
we
are
in
occur
to
me
as
are
more
things
in
and
than
even
the
most
devoted
domestic
can
sometimes
be
aweer
of
and
gently
sauntering
by
britta
side
briggs
began
to
converse
in
low
and
confidential
tones
she
listened
with
strained
and
eager
attention
and
she
was
soon
receiving
information
that
startled
her
and
set
her
on
the
alert
talk
of
private
detectives
and
secret
service
do
private
detectives
ever
discover
so
much
as
the
servants
of
a
man
own
household
servants
who
are
aware
of
the
smallest
trifles
who
know
the
name
and
position
of
every
visitor
that
comes
and
goes
who
easily
learn
to
recognize
the
handwriting
on
every
letter
that
arrives
who
laugh
and
talk
in
their
kitchens
over
things
that
their
credulous
masters
and
mistresses
imagine
are
unknown
to
all
the
world
save
themselves
who
will
judge
the
morals
of
a
duke
and
tear
the
reputation
of
a
duchess
to
shreds
for
the
least
the
most
trifling
error
of
conduct
if
you
can
stand
well
with
your
servants
you
can
stand
well
with
the
whole
world
if
not
carry
yourself
as
haughtily
as
you
may
your
pride
will
not
last
long
depend
upon
it
meanwhile
as
briggs
and
britta
strolled
in
the
side
paths
of
the
shrubbery
the
gay
guests
of
the
manor
were
dancing
on
the
lawn
thelma
did
not
dance
she
reclined
in
a
low
fanning
herself
george
lorimer
lay
stretched
in
lazy
length
at
her
feet
and
near
her
stood
her
husband
together
with
beau
lovelace
and
lord
winsleigh
at
a
little
distance
under
the
shadow
of
a
noble
beech
sat
and
van
clupp
in
earnest
conversation
it
was
to
marvelle
that
the
van
clupps
owed
their
invitation
for
this
one
day
down
to
errington
manor
for
thelma
herself
was
not
partial
to
them
but
she
did
not
like
to
refuse
marvelle
earnest
entreaty
that
they
should
be
asked
and
that
scheming
lady
having
gained
her
point
straightway
said
to
marcia
van
clupp
somewhat
severely
now
marcia
this
is
your
last
chance
if
you
do
hook
masherville
at
the
carringten
fête
you
lose
him
you
mark
my
words
marcia
had
dutifully
promised
to
do
her
best
and
she
was
not
having
what
she
herself
called
a
good
hard
time
of
it
lord
algy
was
in
one
of
his
most
provokingly
vacillating
moods
moreover
he
had
a
headache
and
felt
bilious
therefore
he
would
not
dance
he
would
not
play
tennis
he
did
not
understand
archery
he
was
disinclined
to
sit
in
romantic
shrubberies
or
as
he
had
a
nervous
dread
of
spiders
so
he
rambled
aimlessly
about
the
grounds
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
perforce
marcia
was
compelled
to
ramble
too
once
she
tried
what
effect
an
opposite
flirtation
would
have
on
his
mind
so
she
coquetted
desperately
with
a
young
country
squire
whose
breed
of
pigs
was
considered
the
finest
in
england
but
masherville
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
nay
he
looked
rather
relieved
than
otherwise
and
marcia
seeing
this
grew
more
resolute
than
ever
i
guess
i
pay
him
out
for
this
she
thought
as
she
watched
him
feebly
drinking
for
his
headache
he
a
man
that
wants
ruling
and
ruled
he
shall
be
and
and
van
clupp
observed
her
manoeuvres
with
maternal
interest
while
the
van
clupp
conversed
condescendingly
with
as
being
a
nonentity
of
a
man
whom
he
could
safely
patronize
as
the
glory
of
the
sunset
paled
and
the
delicate
warm
hues
of
the
summer
twilight
softened
the
landscape
the
merriment
of
the
brilliant
assembly
seemed
to
increase
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
the
grounds
were
to
be
illuminated
by
electricity
and
dancing
was
to
be
continued
indoors
the
fine
old
being
the
place
chosen
for
the
purpose
nothing
that
could
add
to
the
utmost
entertainment
of
the
guests
had
been
forgotten
and
thelma
the
fair
mistress
of
these
pleasant
revels
noting
with
quiet
eyes
the
evident
enjoyment
of
all
present
felt
very
happy
and
tranquil
she
had
exerted
herself
a
good
deal
and
was
now
a
little
tired
her
eyes
had
a
dreamy
look
and
she
found
her
thoughts
wandering
now
and
then
away
to
the
altenfjord
she
almost
fancied
she
could
hear
the
sigh
of
the
pines
and
the
dash
of
the
waves
mingling
in
unison
as
they
used
to
do
when
she
sat
at
the
old
window
and
span
little
dreaming
then
how
her
life
would
change
how
all
those
familiar
things
would
be
swept
away
as
though
they
had
never
been
she
roused
herself
from
this
momentary
reverie
and
glancing
down
at
the
recumbent
gentleman
at
her
feet
touched
his
shoulder
lightly
with
the
edge
of
her
fan
why
do
you
not
dance
you
very
lazy
mr
lorimer
she
asked
with
a
smile
he
turned
up
his
fair
face
to
hers
and
laughed
dance
i
good
gracious
such
an
exertion
would
kill
me
lady
errington
do
you
know
that
i
am
of
a
disposition
i
should
mind
having
slaves
to
dance
for
me
if
they
did
it
well
but
i
should
look
on
from
the
throne
whereon
i
sat
and
smoke
my
pipe
in
peace
always
the
same
she
said
lightly
are
you
never
serious
his
eyes
darkened
suddenly
sometimes
awfully
so
and
in
that
condition
i
become
a
burden
to
myself
and
my
friends
never
be
serious
interposed
beau
lovelace
it
really
is
worth
while
cultivate
the
humor
of
a
socrates
and
reduce
everything
by
means
of
close
argument
to
its
smallest
standpoint
and
the
world
life
and
time
are
no
more
than
a
pinch
of
snuff
for
some
great
titantic
god
to
please
his
giant
nose
withal
your
fame
is
worth
much
then
beau
if
we
to
go
by
that
line
of
argument
remarked
errington
with
a
laugh
fame
by
jove
you
do
suppose
i
such
an
arrant
donkey
as
to
set
any
store
by
fame
cried
lovelace
a
broad
smile
lighting
up
his
face
and
eyes
why
because
a
few
people
read
my
books
and
are
amused
thereby
and
because
the
press
pats
me
graciously
on
the
back
and
says
metaphorically
done
little
or
words
to
that
effect
am
i
to
go
crowing
about
the
world
as
if
i
were
the
only
literary
chanticleer
my
dear
friend
have
you
read
you
will
find
there
that
a
certain
king
of
persia
wrote
to
one
a
no
doubt
he
was
famous
in
his
day
but
to
travesty
be
his
stories
now
learn
from
the
deep
oblivion
into
which
poor
rathumus
literary
efforts
have
fallen
the
utter
mockery
and
uselessness
of
but
there
must
be
a
certain
pleasure
in
it
while
you
alive
to
enjoy
it
said
lord
winsleigh
surely
you
derive
some
little
satisfaction
from
your
celebrity
mr
lovelace
beau
broke
into
a
laugh
mellow
musical
and
hearty
a
satisfaction
shared
with
murderers
thieves
divorced
women
dynamiters
and
other
notorious
people
in
general
he
said
all
talked
about
so
am
i
they
all
get
written
about
so
do
i
my
biography
is
always
being
carefully
compiled
by
newspaper
authorities
to
the
delight
of
the
reading
public
only
the
other
day
i
learned
for
the
first
time
that
my
father
was
a
greengrocer
who
went
in
for
selling
coals
by
the
and
thereby
made
his
fortune
my
mother
was
an
unsuccessful
who
failed
ignominiously
at
margate
moreover
i
a
great
many
brothers
and
sisters
of
tender
age
whom
i
absolutely
refuse
to
assist
i
got
a
wife
somewhere
whom
my
literary
success
causes
me
to
despise
and
i
have
deserted
children
i
charmed
with
the
accuracy
of
the
newspapers
and
i
would
contradict
them
for
the
world
i
find
my
biographies
so
original
they
are
the
result
of
that
celebrity
which
winsleigh
thinks
enjoyable
but
assertions
of
that
kind
are
libels
said
errington
you
could
prosecute
too
much
trouble
declared
beau
besides
five
journals
have
disclosed
the
name
of
the
town
where
i
was
born
and
as
they
all
contradict
each
other
and
none
of
them
are
right
any
contradiction
on
part
would
be
superfluous
they
laughed
and
at
that
moment
lady
winsleigh
joined
them
are
you
not
catching
cold
thelma
she
inquired
sweetly
sir
philip
you
ought
to
make
her
put
on
something
warm
i
find
the
air
growing
chilly
at
that
moment
the
sir
francis
lennox
approached
with
a
light
woolen
wrap
he
had
found
in
the
hall
permit
me
he
said
gently
at
the
same
time
adroitly
throwing
it
over
thelma
shoulders
she
colored
a
little
she
did
not
care
for
his
attention
but
she
could
not
very
well
ignore
it
without
seeming
to
be
discourteous
so
she
murmured
thank
you
and
rising
from
her
chair
addressed
lady
winsleigh
if
you
feel
cold
clara
you
will
like
some
tea
she
said
shall
we
go
indoors
where
it
is
ready
lady
winsleigh
assented
with
some
eagerness
and
the
two
beautiful
women
the
one
dark
the
other
fair
walked
side
by
side
across
the
lawn
into
the
house
their
arms
round
each
other
waists
as
they
went
two
queens
and
yet
not
rivals
half
queried
lovelace
as
he
watched
them
disappearing
their
thrones
are
secure
returned
sir
philip
gaily
the
others
were
silent
lord
winsleigh
thoughts
whatever
they
were
deepened
the
lines
of
gravity
on
his
face
and
george
lorimer
as
he
got
up
from
his
couch
on
the
grass
caught
a
fleeting
expression
in
the
brown
eyes
of
sir
francis
lennox
that
struck
him
with
a
sense
of
unpleasantness
but
he
quickly
dismissed
the
impression
from
his
mind
and
went
to
have
a
quiet
smoke
in
the
shrubbery

saadi
thelma
took
her
friend
lady
winsleigh
to
her
own
boudoir
a
room
which
had
been
the
particular
pride
of
sir
philip
mother
the
walls
were
decorated
with
panels
of
blue
silk
in
which
were
woven
flowers
of
gold
and
silver
thread
and
the
furniture
bought
from
an
old
palace
in
milan
was
of
elaborately
carved
wood
inlaid
with
ivory
and
silver
here
a
tea
was
served
for
the
two
ladies
both
of
whom
were
somewhat
fatigued
by
the
pleasures
of
the
day
lady
winsleigh
declared
she
must
have
some
rest
or
she
would
be
quite
unequal
to
the
gaieties
of
the
approaching
evening
and
thelma
herself
was
not
sorry
to
escape
for
a
little
from
her
duties
as
hostess
so
the
two
remained
together
for
some
time
in
earnest
conversations
and
lady
winsleigh
then
and
there
confided
to
thelma
what
she
had
heard
reported
concerning
sir
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
burlesque
actress
violet
vere
and
they
were
both
so
long
absent
that
after
a
while
errington
began
to
miss
his
wife
and
growing
impatient
went
in
search
of
her
he
entered
the
boudoir
and
to
his
surprise
found
lady
winsleigh
there
quite
alone
where
is
thelma
he
demanded
she
seems
not
very
well
a
slight
headache
or
something
of
that
sort
and
has
gone
to
lie
down
replied
lady
winsleigh
with
a
faint
trace
of
embarrassment
in
her
manner
i
think
the
heat
has
been
too
much
for
her
i
go
and
see
after
her
and
he
turned
promptly
to
leave
the
room
sir
philip
called
lady
winsleigh
he
paused
and
looked
back
stay
one
moment
continued
her
ladyship
softly
i
have
been
for
a
long
time
so
very
anxious
to
say
something
to
you
in
private
please
let
me
speak
now
you
you
know
here
she
cast
down
her
lustrous
eyes
before
you
went
to
norway
i
i
was
very
foolish
pray
do
not
recall
it
he
said
with
kindly
gravity
have
forgotten
it
that
is
so
good
of
you
and
a
flush
of
color
warmed
her
delicate
cheeks
for
if
you
have
forgotten
you
have
also
forgiven
entirely
answered
errington
and
touched
by
her
plaintive
manner
and
trembling
voice
he
went
up
to
her
and
took
her
hands
in
his
own
do
think
of
the
past
clara
perhaps
i
also
was
to
blame
a
little
i
quite
willing
to
think
i
was
flirtation
a
dangerous
amusement
at
best
he
paused
as
he
saw
two
bright
tears
on
her
long
silky
lashes
and
in
his
heart
felt
a
sort
of
remorse
that
he
had
ever
permitted
himself
to
think
badly
of
her
we
are
the
best
of
friends
now
clara
he
continued
cheerfully
and
i
hope
we
may
always
remain
so
you
ca
imagine
how
glad
i
am
that
you
love
my
thelma
who
would
not
love
her
sighed
lady
winsleigh
gently
as
sir
philip
released
her
hands
from
his
warm
clasp
then
raising
her
tearful
eyes
to
his
she
added
wistfully
you
must
take
great
care
of
her
philip
she
is
so
sensitive
i
always
fancy
an
unkind
word
would
kill
her
she
never
hear
one
from
me
he
returned
with
so
tender
and
earnest
a
look
on
his
face
that
lady
winsleigh
heart
ached
for
jealousy
i
must
really
go
and
see
how
she
is
she
been
exerting
herself
too
much
excuse
me
and
with
a
courteous
smile
and
bow
he
left
the
room
with
a
hurried
and
eager
step
alone
lady
winsleigh
smiled
bitterly
men
are
all
alike
she
said
half
aloud
who
would
think
he
was
such
a
hypocrite
fancy
his
dividing
his
affection
between
two
such
contrasts
as
thelma
and
violet
vere
however
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
as
for
man
fidelity
i
would
give
a
straw
for
it
and
for
his
morality
she
finished
the
sentence
with
a
scornful
laugh
and
left
the
boudoir
to
return
to
the
rest
of
the
company
errington
meanwhile
knocked
softly
at
the
door
of
his
bedroom
and
receiving
no
answer
turned
the
handle
noiselessly
and
went
in
thelma
lay
on
the
bed
dressed
as
she
was
her
cheek
resting
on
her
hand
and
her
face
partially
hidden
her
husband
approached
on
tiptoe
and
lightly
kissed
her
forehead
she
did
not
stir
she
appeared
to
sleep
profoundly
poor
girl
he
thought
she
tired
out
and
no
wonder
with
all
the
bustle
and
racket
of
these
people
a
good
thing
if
she
can
rest
a
little
before
the
evening
closes
in
and
he
stole
quietly
out
of
the
room
and
meeting
britta
on
the
stairs
told
her
on
no
account
to
let
her
mistress
be
disturbed
till
it
was
time
for
the
illumination
of
the
grounds
britta
promised
britta
eyes
were
red
one
would
almost
have
fancied
she
had
been
crying
but
thelma
was
not
asleep
she
had
felt
her
husband
kiss
her
heart
had
beat
as
quickly
as
the
wing
of
a
caged
wild
bird
at
his
warm
touch
and
now
he
had
gone
she
turned
and
pressed
her
lips
passionately
on
the
pillow
where
his
hand
had
leaned
then
she
rose
languidly
from
the
bed
and
walking
slowly
to
the
door
locked
it
against
all
comers
presently
she
began
to
pace
the
room
up
and
down
up
and
down
her
face
was
very
white
and
weary
and
every
now
and
then
a
shuddering
sigh
broke
from
her
lips
can
i
believe
it
oh
no
i
can
not
i
will
not
she
murmured
there
must
be
some
mistake
clara
has
heard
wrongly
she
sighed
again
yet
if
it
is
so
he
is
not
to
blame
it
is
i
i
who
have
failed
to
please
him
where
how
have
i
failed
a
pained
puzzled
look
filled
her
grave
blue
eyes
and
she
stopped
in
her
walk
to
and
fro
it
can
not
be
true
she
said
half
aloud
it
is
altogether
unlike
him
though
clara
says
and
she
has
known
him
so
long
clara
says
he
loved
once
long
before
he
saw
me
my
poor
philip
he
must
have
suffered
by
that
love
perhaps
that
is
why
he
thought
life
so
wearisome
when
he
first
came
to
the
altenfjord
ah
the
altenfjord
a
choking
sob
rose
in
her
throat
but
she
repressed
it
i
must
try
not
to
weary
him
she
continued
softly
i
must
have
done
so
in
some
way
or
he
would
not
be
tired
but
as
for
what
i
have
heard
it
is
not
for
me
to
ask
him
questions
i
would
not
have
him
think
that
i
mistrust
him
no
there
is
some
fault
in
me
something
he
does
not
like
or
he
would
never
go
to
she
broke
off
and
stretched
out
her
hands
with
a
sort
of
wild
appeal
oh
philip
my
darling
she
exclaimed
in
a
sobbing
whisper
i
always
knew
i
was
not
worthy
of
you
but
i
thought
i
hoped
my
love
would
make
amends
for
all
my
shortcomings
tears
rushed
into
her
eyes
and
she
turned
to
a
little
arched
recess
shaded
by
velvet
curtains
her
oratory
where
stood
an
exquisite
white
marble
statuette
of
the
virgin
and
child
there
she
knelt
for
some
minutes
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
and
when
she
rose
she
was
quite
calm
though
very
pale
she
freshened
her
face
with
cold
water
rearranged
her
disordered
hair
and
then
went
downstairs
thereby
running
into
the
arms
of
her
husband
who
was
coming
up
again
to
look
as
he
said
at
his
sleeping
beauty
and
here
she
is
he
exclaimed
joyously
have
you
rested
enough
my
pet
indeed
yes
she
answered
gently
i
am
ashamed
so
be
so
lazy
have
you
wanted
me
philip
i
always
want
you
he
declared
i
am
never
happy
without
you
she
smiled
and
sighed
you
say
that
to
please
me
she
said
half
wistfully
i
say
it
because
it
is
true
he
asserted
proudly
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
escorting
her
in
this
manner
down
the
great
staircase
and
you
know
it
you
sweet
witch
you
just
in
time
to
see
the
lighting
up
of
the
grounds
there
be
a
good
view
from
the
lots
of
the
people
have
gone
in
there
you
better
come
too
for
it
chilly
outside
she
followed
him
obediently
and
her
reappearance
among
her
guests
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
lady
winsleigh
being
particular
effusive
almost
too
much
so
your
headache
has
quite
gone
dearest
has
it
she
inquired
sweetly
thelma
eyed
her
gravely
i
did
not
suffer
from
the
headache
clara
she
said
i
was
a
little
tired
but
i
am
quite
rested
now
lady
winsleigh
bit
her
lips
rather
vexedly
but
said
no
more
and
at
that
moment
exclamations
of
delight
broke
from
all
assembled
at
the
brilliant
scene
that
suddenly
flashed
upon
their
eyes
electricity
that
radiant
sprite
whose
magic
wand
has
lately
been
bent
to
the
service
of
man
had
in
less
than
a
minute
played
such
dazzling
pranks
in
the
gardens
that
they
resembled
the
fabled
discovered
by
aladdin
every
tree
glittered
with
sparkling
clusters
of
red
blue
and
green
light
every
was
bordered
with
lines
and
circles
of
harmless
flame
and
the
fountains
tossed
up
tall
columns
of
amber
rose
and
amethyst
spray
against
the
soft
blue
darkness
of
the
sky
in
which
a
lustrous
golden
moon
had
just
risen
the
brilliancy
of
the
illuminations
showed
up
several
dark
figures
strolling
in
couples
about
the
grounds
romantic
persons
evidently
who
were
not
to
be
persuaded
to
come
indoors
even
for
the
music
of
the
band
which
just
then
burst
forth
invitingly
through
the
open
windows
of
the
two
of
these
pensive
wanderers
were
marcia
van
clupp
and
lord
algernon
masherville
and
lord
algy
was
in
a
curiously
sentimental
frame
of
mind
and
weak
withal
une
petite
queue
he
had
taken
a
good
deal
of
soda
and
brandy
for
his
bilious
headache
and
physically
he
was
much
better
but
mentally
he
was
not
quite
his
ordinary
self
by
this
it
must
not
be
understood
that
he
was
at
all
unsteadied
by
the
potency
of
his
medicinal
tipple
he
was
simply
in
a
bland
humor
that
peculiar
sort
of
humor
which
finds
strange
and
mystic
beauty
in
everything
and
contemplates
the
meanest
trifles
with
emotions
of
large
benevolence
he
was
conversational
too
and
inclined
to
quote
poetry
this
sort
of
susceptibleness
often
affects
gentlemen
after
they
have
had
an
excellent
dinner
flavored
with
the
finest
burgundy
lord
algy
was
as
mild
as
tame
and
as
flabby
as
a
sleeping
and
in
this
inoffensive
almost
tender
mood
of
his
marcia
pounced
upon
him
she
looked
ravishingly
pretty
in
the
moonlight
with
a
white
wrap
thrown
carelessly
round
her
head
and
shoulders
and
her
bold
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
for
who
that
knows
the
pleasure
of
sports
is
not
excited
when
the
fox
is
nearly
run
to
earth
and
she
stood
with
him
beside
one
of
the
smaller
illuminated
fountains
raising
her
small
white
hand
every
now
and
then
to
catch
some
of
the
rainbow
drops
and
then
with
a
laugh
she
would
shake
them
off
her
little
pearly
nails
into
the
air
again
poor
masherville
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
with
a
admiration
in
his
pale
eyes
and
marcia
calculating
every
move
in
her
own
shrewd
mind
saw
it
she
turned
her
head
away
with
a
petulant
yet
coquettish
movement
my
patience
she
exclaimed
yew
stare
yew
know
me
again
when
yew
see
me
say
i
should
know
you
anywhere
declared
masherville
nervously
fumbling
with
the
string
of
his
it
impossible
to
forget
face
miss
marcia
she
was
silent
and
kept
that
face
turned
from
him
so
long
that
the
gentle
little
lord
was
surprised
he
approached
her
more
closely
and
took
her
hand
the
hand
that
had
played
with
the
drops
in
the
fountain
it
was
such
an
astonishingly
small
so
very
and
tiny
that
he
was
almost
for
putting
up
his
to
survey
it
as
if
it
were
a
separate
object
in
a
museum
but
the
faintest
pressure
of
the
delicate
fingers
he
held
startled
him
and
sent
the
most
curious
thrill
through
his
body
and
when
he
spoke
he
was
in
such
a
flutter
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
miss
miss
marcia
he
stammered
have
have
i
said
anything
to
to
offend
you
very
slowly
and
with
seeming
reluctance
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
and
oh
thou
mischievous
puck
that
sometimes
takest
upon
thee
the
semblance
of
eros
what
skill
is
thine
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
real
tears
bright
large
tears
that
welled
up
and
fell
through
her
long
lashes
in
the
most
beautiful
touching
and
becoming
manner
and
thought
marcia
to
herself
if
i
do
fetch
him
now
i
never
will
lord
algy
was
quite
frightened
his
poor
brain
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
why
miss
marcia
i
say
look
here
he
mumbled
in
his
extremity
squeezing
her
little
hand
tighter
and
tighter
what
what
i
done
good
gracious
you
you
really
must
cry
you
know
i
say
look
here
marcia
i
would
vex
you
for
the
world
yew
bet
yew
would
said
marcia
with
slow
and
nasal
plaintiveness
i
like
that
that
the
way
yew
english
talk
but
yew
kin
hang
round
a
girl
a
whole
season
and
make
all
her
folks
think
badly
of
her
and
and
break
her
heart
yes
that
so
here
she
dried
her
eyes
with
a
filmy
lace
handkerchief
but
do
mind
me
i
kin
bear
it
i
kin
worry
through
and
she
drew
herself
up
with
dignified
resignation
while
lord
algy
stared
wildly
at
her
his
feeble
mind
in
a
whirl
presently
she
smiled
most
seductively
and
looked
up
with
her
dark
eyes
to
the
moon
i
guess
it
a
good
night
for
lovers
she
said
sinking
her
ordinary
tone
to
an
almost
sweet
cadence
but
we
not
of
that
sort
are
we
the
die
was
cast
she
looked
so
charming
so
irresistible
that
masherville
lost
all
hold
over
his
wits
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
oh
what
a
warm
yielding
waist
he
drew
her
close
to
his
breast
at
the
risk
of
breaking
his
most
valuable
eyeglass
and
felt
his
poor
weak
soul
in
a
quiver
of
excitement
at
this
novel
and
delicious
sensation
we
are
we
are
of
that
sort
he
declared
courageously
why
should
you
doubt
it
marcia
i
believe
if
say
so
responded
marcia
but
i
guess
only
fooling
me
fooling
you
lord
algy
was
so
surprised
that
he
released
her
quite
suddenly
from
his
embrace
so
suddenly
that
she
was
a
little
frightened
was
she
to
lose
him
after
all
marcia
he
continued
mildly
yet
with
a
certain
manliness
that
did
not
ill
become
him
i
i
hope
i
am
too
much
of
of
a
gentleman
to
to
any
woman
least
of
all
you
after
i
have
as
you
say
compromised
you
in
society
by
my
my
attentions
i
i
have
very
little
to
offer
you
but
such
as
it
is
is
yours
in
in
short
marcia
i
i
will
try
to
make
you
happy
if
you
can
can
care
for
me
enough
to
to
marry
me
eureka
the
game
was
won
a
vision
of
masherville
park
yorkshire
that
and
highly
desirable
residence
as
the
auctioneers
would
describe
it
flitted
before
marcia
eyes
and
filled
with
triumph
she
went
straight
into
her
lordly
wooer
arms
and
kissed
him
with
thorough
transatlantic
frankness
she
was
really
grateful
to
him
ever
since
she
had
come
to
england
she
had
plotted
and
schemed
to
become
my
lady
with
all
the
vigor
of
a
purely
republican
soul
and
now
at
last
after
hard
fighting
she
had
won
the
prize
for
which
her
soul
had
yearned
she
would
in
future
belong
to
the
english
aristocracy
that
aristocracy
which
her
relatives
in
new
york
pretended
to
despise
yet
openly
flattered
and
with
her
arms
round
the
trapped
neck
she
foresaw
the
delight
she
would
have
in
being
toadied
by
them
as
far
as
toadyism
could
be
made
to
go
she
is
by
no
means
presented
to
the
reader
as
a
favorable
type
of
her
nation
for
of
course
every
one
knows
there
are
plenty
of
sweet
unselfish
guileless
american
girls
who
are
absolutely
incapable
of
such
unblushing
as
hers
but
what
else
could
be
expected
from
marcia
her
grandfather
the
navvy
had
but
recently
become
endowed
with
ancestry
and
her
maternal
uncle
was
a
boastful
in
cincinnati
it
was
her
bounden
duty
to
ennoble
the
family
somehow
surely
if
any
one
had
a
right
to
be
ambitious
she
was
that
one
and
wild
proud
dreams
of
her
future
passed
through
her
brain
little
lord
algy
quivered
meekly
under
her
kiss
and
returned
it
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
which
he
was
capable
one
or
two
faint
misgivings
troubled
him
as
to
whether
he
had
not
been
just
a
little
too
hasty
in
making
a
serious
offer
of
marriage
to
the
young
lady
by
whose
pilgrim
progenitors
he
was
not
deceived
he
knew
well
enough
what
her
antecedents
were
and
a
faint
shudder
crossed
him
as
he
thought
of
the
uncle
who
would
by
marriage
become
uncle
also
he
had
long
been
proud
of
the
fact
that
the
house
of
masherville
had
never
through
the
course
of
centuries
been
associated
even
in
the
remotest
manner
with
trade
and
now
yet
after
all
he
mused
the
marquis
of
londonderry
openly
advertises
himself
as
a
and
the
of
the
princess
louise
are
in
the
wine
trade
and
business
and
all
the
old
knightly
blood
of
england
is
mingling
itself
by
choice
with
that
of
the
lowest
commoners
what
the
use
of
my
remaining
aloof
and
refusing
to
go
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
besides
marcia
loves
me
and
it
pleasant
to
be
loved
poor
lord
algy
he
certainly
thought
there
could
be
no
question
about
marcia
affection
for
him
he
little
dreamed
that
it
was
to
his
title
and
position
she
had
become
so
deeply
attached
he
could
not
guess
that
after
he
had
married
her
there
would
be
no
more
lord
masherville
worth
mentioning
that
that
individual
once
independent
would
be
entirely
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
dashing
personality
of
lady
masherville
who
would
rule
her
husband
as
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
was
happily
ignorant
of
his
future
and
he
walked
in
the
gardens
for
some
time
with
his
arm
round
marcia
waist
in
a
very
placid
and
romantic
frame
of
mind
he
escorted
her
into
the
house
where
the
dancing
was
in
full
swing
and
she
with
a
sweet
smile
bidding
him
wait
for
her
in
the
sought
for
and
found
her
mother
who
as
usual
was
seated
in
a
quiet
corner
with
talking
scandal
well
exclaimed
these
two
ladies
simultaneously
and
breathlessly
marcia
eyes
twinkled
guess
he
came
in
as
gently
as
a
lamb
she
said
they
understood
her
rose
from
her
chair
in
her
usual
stately
and
expensive
manner
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
kissing
marcia
affectionately
on
both
cheeks
bruce
errington
would
have
been
a
better
match
but
under
the
circumstances
masherville
is
really
about
the
best
thing
you
could
do
you
find
him
quite
easy
to
manage
this
with
an
air
as
though
she
were
recommending
a
quiet
pony
that
so
said
marcia
carelessly
i
guess
we
pull
together
somehow
to
her
mother
yew
kin
turn
on
the
news
to
all
the
folks
yew
meet
the
more
talk
the
better
i
not
partial
to
secrets
and
with
a
laugh
she
turned
away
then
van
clupp
laid
her
plump
hand
on
that
of
her
dear
friend
marvelle
you
have
managed
the
whole
thing
beautifully
she
said
with
a
grateful
heave
of
her
ample
bosom
such
a
clever
creature
as
you
are
she
dropped
her
voice
to
a
mysterious
whisper
you
shall
have
that
cheque
my
love
pressed
her
fingers
cordially
do
hurry
yourself
about
it
she
returned
in
the
same
confidential
tone
i
dare
say
you
want
me
to
arrange
the
wedding
and
the
afterwards
i
can
wait
till
then
no
no
that
a
separate
affair
declared
van
clupp
i
must
insist
on
your
taking
the
promised
two
hundred
you
been
really
so
energetic
well
i
worked
rather
hard
said
marvelle
with
modest
you
see
nowadays
it
so
difficult
to
secure
suitable
husbands
for
the
girls
who
ought
to
have
them
men
such
slippery
creatures
she
sighed
and
van
clupp
echoed
the
sigh
and
then
these
two
ladies
the
nature
of
whose
intimacy
may
now
be
understood
by
the
discriminating
reader
went
together
to
search
out
those
of
their
friends
and
acquaintances
who
were
among
the
guests
that
night
and
to
announce
to
them
in
the
strictest
confidence
of
course
the
delightful
news
of
dear
marcia
engagement
thelma
heard
of
it
and
went
at
once
to
proffer
her
congratulations
to
marcia
in
person
i
hope
you
will
be
very
very
happy
she
said
simply
yet
with
such
grave
earnestness
in
her
look
and
voice
that
the
yankee
gel
was
touched
to
a
certain
softness
and
seriousness
not
at
all
usual
with
her
and
became
so
winning
and
gentle
to
lord
algy
that
he
felt
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
with
his
new
position
as
affianced
lover
to
so
charming
a
creature
meanwhile
george
lorimer
and
pierre
duprèz
were
chatting
together
in
the
library
it
was
very
quiet
there
the
goodly
rows
of
books
the
busts
of
poets
and
philosophers
the
large
placid
features
of
the
pallas
athene
crowning
an
antique
pedestal
the
golden
pipes
of
the
organ
gleaming
through
the
shadows
all
these
gave
a
solemn
almost
sacred
aspect
to
the
room
the
noise
of
the
dancing
and
festivity
in
the
distant
did
not
penetrate
here
and
lorimer
sat
at
the
organ
drawing
out
a
few
plaintive
strains
from
its
keys
as
he
talked
it
your
fancy
pierre
he
said
slowly
thelma
may
be
a
little
tired
perhaps
but
i
know
she
perfectly
happy
i
think
not
so
returned
duprèz
she
has
not
the
brightness
the
angel
look
yeux
that
we
beheld
in
her
at
that
far
norwegian
fjord
britta
is
anxious
for
her
lorimer
looked
up
and
smiled
a
little
britta
it
always
britta
with
you
one
would
think
he
paused
and
laughed
think
what
you
please
exclaimed
duprèz
with
a
defiant
snap
of
his
fingers
i
would
not
give
that
little
person
for
all
the
here
she
is
charming
and
she
is
foi
to
be
true
to
any
one
is
a
virtue
in
this
age
i
tell
you
my
good
boy
there
is
something
sorrowful
heavy
on
thelma
mind
and
britta
who
sees
her
always
feels
it
but
she
can
not
speak
one
thing
i
will
tell
you
it
is
a
pity
she
is
so
fond
of
miladi
winsleigh
why
asked
lorimer
with
some
eagerness
because
he
stopped
abruptly
as
a
white
figure
suddenly
appeared
at
the
doorway
and
a
musical
voice
addressed
them
why
what
are
you
both
doing
here
away
from
everybody
and
thelma
smiled
as
she
approached
you
are
hermits
or
you
are
lazy
people
are
going
in
to
supper
will
you
not
come
also
foi
exclaimed
duprèz
i
had
forgotten
i
have
promised
your
most
charming
mother
lorimer
to
take
her
in
to
this
same
supper
i
must
fly
upon
the
wings
of
chivalry
and
with
a
laugh
he
hurried
off
leaving
thelma
and
lorimer
alone
together
she
sank
rather
wearily
into
a
chair
near
the
organ
and
looked
at
him
play
me
something
she
said
softly
a
strange
thrill
quivered
through
him
as
he
met
her
eyes
the
sweet
deep
earnest
eyes
of
the
woman
he
loved
for
it
was
no
use
attempting
to
disguise
it
from
himself
he
loved
her
passionately
wildly
hopelessly
as
he
had
loved
her
from
the
first
obedient
to
her
wish
his
fingers
wandered
over
the
in
a
strain
of
solemn
weird
yet
tender
melancholy
the
grand
rich
notes
pealed
forth
sobbingly
and
she
listened
her
hands
clasped
idly
in
her
lap
presently
he
changed
the
theme
to
one
of
more
passion
and
a
strange
wild
minor
air
like
the
rushing
of
the
wind
across
the
mountains
began
to
make
itself
heard
through
the
subdued
rippling
murmur
of
his
improvised
accompaniment
to
his
surprise
and
fear
she
started
up
pressing
her
hands
against
her
ears
not
that
not
that
song
my
friend
she
cried
almost
imploringly
oh
it
will
break
my
heart
oh
the
altenfjord
and
she
gave
way
to
a
passion
of
weeping
thelma
thelma
and
poor
lorimer
rising
from
the
organ
stood
gazing
at
her
in
piteous
dismay
every
nerve
in
his
body
wrung
to
anguish
by
the
sound
of
her
sobbing
a
mad
longing
seized
him
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
to
gather
her
and
her
sorrows
whatever
they
were
to
his
heart
and
he
had
much
ado
to
restrain
himself
thelma
he
presently
said
in
a
gentle
voice
that
trembled
just
a
little
thelma
what
is
troubling
you
you
call
me
your
brother
give
me
a
brother
right
to
your
confidence
he
bent
over
her
and
took
her
hand
i
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
cry
like
this
tell
me
what
the
matter
let
me
fetch
philip
she
looked
up
with
wild
wet
eyes
and
quivering
lips
oh
no
no
she
murmured
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
and
alarm
do
not
philip
must
not
know
i
do
wish
him
always
to
see
me
bright
and
cheerful
and
it
is
nothing
it
is
that
i
heard
something
which
grieved
me
what
was
it
asked
lorimer
remembering
duprèz
recent
remarks
oh
i
would
not
tell
you
she
said
eagerly
drying
her
eyes
and
endeavoring
to
smile
because
i
am
sure
it
was
a
mistake
and
all
wrong
and
i
was
foolish
to
fancy
that
such
a
thing
could
be
even
for
a
moment
but
when
one
does
not
know
the
world
it
seems
cruel
thelma
what
do
you
mean
and
george
surveyed
her
in
some
perplexity
if
any
one
been
bothering
or
vexing
you
just
you
tell
phil
all
about
it
do
have
any
secrets
from
him
he
soon
put
everything
straight
whatever
it
is
she
shook
her
head
slightly
ah
you
do
not
understand
she
said
pathetically
how
should
you
because
you
have
not
given
your
life
away
to
any
one
and
it
is
all
different
with
you
but
when
you
do
love
if
you
are
at
all
like
me
you
will
be
so
anxious
to
always
seem
worthy
of
love
and
you
will
hide
all
your
griefs
away
from
your
beloved
so
that
your
constant
presence
shall
not
seem
tiresome
and
i
would
not
for
all
the
world
trouble
philip
with
my
silly
fancies
because
then
he
might
grow
more
weary
still
interrupted
lorimer
in
an
accent
of
emphatic
surprise
why
you
do
suppose
phil
tired
of
you
thelma
that
nonsense
indeed
he
worships
you
who
been
putting
such
notions
into
your
head
she
rose
from
her
chair
quite
calm
and
very
pale
and
laid
her
two
trembling
hands
in
his
ah
you
also
will
mistake
me
she
said
with
touching
sweetness
like
so
many
others
who
think
me
strange
in
my
speech
and
manner
i
am
sorry
i
am
not
like
other
women
but
i
can
not
help
it
what
i
do
wish
you
to
understand
is
that
i
never
suppose
anything
against
my
philip
he
is
the
noblest
and
best
of
men
and
you
must
promise
not
to
tell
him
that
i
was
so
foolish
as
to
cry
just
now
because
you
played
that
old
song
i
sang
to
you
both
so
often
in
norway
it
was
because
i
felt
a
little
sad
but
it
was
only
a
fancy
and
i
would
not
have
him
troubled
with
such
things
will
you
promise
but
what
has
made
you
sad
persisted
lorimer
still
puzzled
nothing
nothing
indeed
she
answered
with
almost
feverish
earnestness
you
yourself
are
sometimes
sad
and
can
you
tell
why
lorimer
certainly
could
have
told
why
but
he
remained
silent
and
gently
kissed
the
little
hands
he
held
then
i
must
tell
philip
of
your
sadness
he
asked
softly
at
last
but
will
you
tell
him
yourself
thelma
depend
upon
it
it
much
better
to
have
no
secrets
from
him
the
least
grief
of
yours
would
affect
him
more
than
the
downfall
of
a
kingdom
you
know
how
dearly
he
loves
you
yes
i
know
she
answered
and
her
eyes
brightened
slowly
and
that
is
why
i
wish
him
always
to
see
me
happy
she
paused
and
then
added
in
a
lower
tone
i
would
rather
die
my
friend
than
vex
him
for
one
hour
george
still
held
her
hands
and
looked
wistfully
in
her
face
he
was
about
to
speak
again
when
a
cold
courteous
voice
interrupted
them
lady
errington
may
i
have
the
honor
of
taking
you
in
to
supper
it
was
sir
francis
lennox
he
had
entered
quite
noiselessly
his
footsteps
making
no
sound
on
the
thick
carpet
and
he
stood
quite
close
to
lorimer
who
dropped
thelma
hands
hastily
and
darted
a
suspicious
glance
at
the
intruder
but
sir
francis
was
the
very
picture
of
unconcerned
and
bland
politeness
and
offered
thelma
his
arm
with
the
graceful
ease
of
an
accomplished
courtier
she
was
perforce
compelled
to
accept
it
and
she
was
slightly
confused
though
she
could
not
have
told
why
sir
philip
has
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
continued
sir
francis
amicably
and
for
you
also
he
added
turning
slightly
to
lorimer
i
trust
i
not
abruptly
broken
off
a
pleasant
lorimer
colored
hotly
not
at
all
he
said
rather
brusquely
been
strumming
on
the
organ
and
lady
errington
has
been
good
enough
to
listen
to
me
you
do
not
said
thelma
with
gentle
reproach
you
play
very
beautifully
ah
a
charming
accomplishment
observed
sir
francis
with
his
and
covert
smile
as
they
all
three
wended
their
way
out
of
the
library
i
regret
i
have
never
had
time
to
devote
myself
to
acquiring
some
knowledge
of
the
arts
in
music
i
am
a
positive
ignoramus
i
can
hold
my
own
best
in
the
field
yes
you
a
great
adept
at
hunting
lennox
remarked
lorimer
suddenly
with
something
sarcastic
in
his
tone
i
suppose
the
quarry
never
escapes
you
seldom
returned
sir
francis
coolly
indeed
i
think
i
may
say
never
and
with
that
he
passed
into
the
elbowing
a
way
for
thelma
till
he
succeeded
in
placing
her
near
the
head
of
the
table
where
she
was
soon
busily
occupied
in
entertaining
her
guests
and
listening
to
their
chatter
and
lorimer
looking
at
her
once
or
twice
saw
to
his
great
relief
that
all
traces
of
her
former
agitation
had
disappeared
leaving
her
face
fair
and
radiant
as
a
spring
morning
chapter
xxiv
a
generous
fierceness
dwells
with
innocence
and
conscious
virtue
is
allowed
some
pride
dryden
the
melancholy
days
of
autumn
came
on
apace
and
the
manor
was
deserted
the
establishment
removed
again
to
town
where
business
connected
with
his
intending
membership
for
parliament
occupied
sir
philip
from
morning
till
night
the
old
insidious
feeling
of
depression
returned
and
hovered
over
thelma
mind
like
a
black
bird
of
ill
omen
and
though
she
did
her
best
to
shake
it
off
she
could
not
succeed
people
began
to
notice
her
deepening
seriousness
and
the
wistful
melancholy
of
her
blue
eyes
and
made
their
remarks
thereon
when
they
saw
her
at
marcia
van
clupp
wedding
an
event
which
came
off
brilliantly
at
the
commencement
of
november
and
which
was
almost
entirely
presided
over
by
that
matron
had
indeed
urged
on
the
wedding
by
every
delicate
expedient
possible
long
engagements
are
a
great
mistake
she
told
marcia
then
in
a
warning
undertone
she
added
men
are
capricious
nowadays
they
all
so
much
in
demand
better
take
masherville
while
he
in
the
humor
marcia
accepted
this
hint
and
took
him
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
saw
the
twain
safely
married
and
off
to
the
continent
on
their
marcia
all
sparkling
and
triumphant
lord
algy
tremulous
and
feebly
ecstatic
thank
heaven
over
she
said
to
her
polite
and
servile
husband
i
never
had
such
a
troublesome
business
in
my
life
that
girl
been
nearly
two
seasons
on
my
hands
and
i
think
five
hundred
guineas
not
a
bit
too
much
for
all
i
done
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
agreed
marvelle
warmly
have
they
have
they
here
he
put
on
a
most
benevolent
quite
settled
with
you
my
dear
every
penny
replied
marvelle
calmly
old
van
clupp
paid
me
the
last
hundred
this
morning
and
poor
van
clupp
is
so
grateful
she
sighed
placidly
and
appeared
to
meditate
then
she
smiled
sweetly
and
approaching
marvelle
patted
his
shoulder
caressingly
i
think
we
do
the
italian
lakes
dear
what
do
you
say
charming
charming
declared
not
her
lord
and
master
but
her
slave
and
vassal
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
and
to
the
italian
lakes
accordingly
they
went
a
great
many
people
were
out
of
town
all
who
had
leisure
and
money
enough
to
liberate
themselves
from
the
approaching
evils
of
an
english
winter
had
departed
or
were
departing
beau
lovelace
had
gone
to
como
george
lorimer
had
returned
with
duprèz
to
paris
and
thelma
had
very
few
visitors
except
lady
winsleigh
who
was
more
often
with
her
now
than
ever
in
fact
her
ladyship
was
more
like
one
of
the
errington
household
than
anything
else
she
came
so
frequently
and
stayed
so
long
she
seemed
sincerely
attached
to
thelma
and
thelma
herself
too
and
simple
to
imagine
that
such
affection
could
be
feigned
gave
her
in
return
what
lady
winsleigh
had
never
succeeded
in
winning
from
any
woman
a
pure
trusting
and
utterly
unsuspecting
love
such
as
she
would
have
lavished
on
a
sister
but
there
was
one
person
who
was
not
deceived
by
lady
winsleigh
charm
of
manner
and
grace
of
speech
this
was
britta
her
keen
eyes
flashed
a
sort
of
unuttered
defiance
into
her
ladyship
beautiful
dark
languishing
ones
she
distrusted
her
and
viewed
the
intimacy
between
her
and
the
fröken
with
entire
disfavor
once
she
ventured
to
express
something
of
her
feeling
on
the
matter
to
thelma
but
thelma
had
looked
so
gently
wondering
and
reproachful
that
britta
had
not
courage
to
go
on
i
am
so
sorry
britta
said
her
mistress
that
you
do
not
like
lady
winsleigh
because
i
am
very
fond
of
her
you
must
try
to
like
her
for
my
sake
but
britta
pursed
her
lips
and
shook
her
head
obstinately
however
she
said
no
more
at
the
time
and
decided
within
herself
to
wait
and
watch
the
course
of
events
and
in
the
meantime
she
became
very
intimate
with
lady
winsleigh
maid
louise
rénaud
and
briggs
and
learned
from
these
two
domestic
authorities
many
things
which
greatly
tormented
and
puzzled
her
little
brain
things
over
which
she
pondered
deeply
without
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
conclusion
on
her
return
to
town
thelma
had
been
inexpressibly
shocked
at
the
changed
appearance
of
her
husband
secretary
edward
neville
at
first
she
scarcely
knew
him
he
had
altered
so
greatly
always
inclined
to
stoop
his
shoulders
were
now
bent
as
by
the
added
weight
of
twenty
years
his
hair
once
only
grizzled
was
now
quite
grey
his
face
was
deeply
sunken
and
pale
and
his
eyes
by
contrast
looked
large
and
wild
as
though
some
haunting
thought
were
driving
him
to
madness
he
shrank
so
nervously
from
her
gaze
that
she
began
to
fancy
he
must
have
taken
some
dislike
to
her
and
though
she
delicately
refrained
from
pressing
questions
upon
him
personally
she
spoke
to
her
husband
about
him
with
real
solicitude
is
neville
working
too
hard
she
asked
one
day
he
looks
very
her
remark
seemed
to
embarrass
philip
he
colored
and
seemed
confused
does
he
oh
i
suppose
he
sleeps
badly
yes
i
remember
he
told
me
so
you
see
the
loss
of
his
wife
has
always
preyed
on
his
mind
he
never
loses
hope
of
of
that
is
he
is
always
trying
to
you
know
to
get
her
back
again
but
do
you
think
he
will
ever
find
her
asked
thelma
i
thought
you
said
it
was
a
hopeless
case
well
i
think
so
certainly
but
you
see
it
no
good
dashing
his
hopes
one
never
knows
she
might
turn
up
any
day
it
a
sort
of
chance
i
wish
i
could
help
him
to
search
for
her
she
said
compassionately
his
eyes
do
look
so
full
of
sorrow
she
paused
and
added
musingly
almost
like
sigurd
eyes
sometimes
oh
he
not
losing
his
wits
said
philip
hastily
he
quite
patient
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
do
bother
about
him
thelma
he
all
right
and
he
fumbled
hastily
with
some
papers
and
began
to
talk
of
something
else
his
embarrassed
manner
caused
her
to
wonder
a
little
at
the
time
as
to
the
reason
of
it
but
she
had
many
other
things
to
think
about
and
she
soon
forgot
a
conversation
that
might
have
proved
a
small
in
the
chain
of
events
that
were
soon
about
to
follow
quickly
one
upon
another
shaking
her
life
to
its
very
foundation
lady
winsleigh
found
it
almost
impossible
to
get
her
on
the
subject
of
the
burlesque
actress
violet
vere
and
sir
philip
supposed
admiration
for
that
notorious
i
do
not
believe
it
she
said
firmly
and
you
you
must
not
believe
it
either
clara
for
wherever
you
heard
it
it
is
wrong
we
should
dishonor
philip
by
such
a
thought
you
are
his
friend
and
i
am
his
wife
we
are
not
the
ones
to
believe
anything
against
him
even
if
it
could
be
proved
and
there
are
no
proofs
my
dear
responded
her
ladyship
easily
you
can
get
proofs
for
yourself
if
you
like
for
instance
ask
sir
philip
how
often
he
has
seen
miss
vere
lately
and
hear
what
he
says
thelma
colored
deeply
i
would
not
question
my
husband
on
such
a
subject
she
said
proudly
oh
well
if
you
are
so
fastidious
and
lady
winsleigh
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
am
not
fastidious
returned
thelma
only
i
do
wish
to
be
worthy
of
his
love
and
i
should
not
be
so
if
i
doubted
him
no
clara
i
will
trust
him
to
the
end
clara
winsleigh
drew
nearer
to
her
and
took
her
hand
even
if
he
were
unfaithful
to
you
she
asked
in
a
low
impressive
tone
unfaithful
thelma
uttered
the
word
with
a
little
cry
clara
dear
clara
you
must
not
say
such
a
word
unfaithful
that
means
that
my
husband
would
love
some
one
more
than
me
ah
that
is
impossible
suppose
it
were
possible
persisted
lady
winsleigh
with
a
cruel
light
in
her
dark
eyes
such
things
have
been
thelma
stood
motionless
a
deeply
mournful
expression
on
her
fair
pale
face
she
seemed
to
think
for
a
moment
then
she
spoke
i
would
never
believe
it
she
said
solemnly
never
unless
i
heard
it
from
his
own
lips
or
saw
it
in
his
own
writing
that
he
was
weary
of
me
and
wanted
me
no
more
and
then
then
she
drew
a
quick
breath
i
should
know
what
to
do
but
clara
you
must
understand
me
well
even
if
this
were
so
i
should
never
blame
him
no
not
once
not
blame
him
cried
lady
winsleigh
impatiently
not
blame
him
for
infidelity
a
deep
blush
swept
over
her
face
at
the
hated
word
infidelity
but
she
answered
steadily
no
because
you
see
it
would
be
my
fault
not
his
when
you
hold
a
flower
in
your
hand
for
a
long
time
till
all
its
fragrance
has
gone
and
you
drop
it
because
it
no
longer
smells
sweetly
you
are
not
to
blame
it
is
natural
you
should
wish
to
have
something
fresh
and
fragrant
it
is
the
flower
fault
because
it
could
not
keep
its
scent
long
enough
to
please
you
now
if
philip
were
to
love
me
no
longer
i
should
be
like
that
flower
and
how
would
he
be
to
blame
he
would
be
good
as
ever
but
i
i
should
have
ceased
to
seem
pleasant
to
him
that
is
all
she
put
this
strange
view
of
the
case
quite
calmly
as
if
it
were
the
only
solution
to
the
question
lady
winsleigh
heard
her
half
in
contemptuous
amusement
half
in
dismay
what
can
i
do
with
such
a
woman
as
this
she
thought
and
fancy
lennie
imagining
for
a
moment
that
he
could
have
any
power
over
her
aloud
she
said
thelma
you
the
oddest
creature
going
a
regular
heathen
child
from
norway
you
set
up
your
husband
as
an
idol
and
you
always
on
your
knees
before
him
it
awfully
sweet
of
you
but
it
quite
absurd
all
the
same
angelic
wives
always
get
the
worst
of
it
and
so
you
see
have
you
heard
that
yes
i
have
heard
it
she
answered
smiling
a
little
but
only
since
i
came
to
london
in
norway
it
is
taught
to
women
that
to
be
patient
and
obedient
is
best
for
every
one
it
is
not
so
here
but
i
am
not
an
angelic
wife
clara
and
so
the
of
it
will
not
apply
to
me
indeed
i
do
not
know
of
any
that
i
would
not
bear
for
sake
lady
winsleigh
studied
the
lovely
face
eloquent
with
love
and
truth
for
some
moments
in
silence
a
kind
of
compunction
pricked
her
conscience
why
destroy
all
that
beautiful
faith
why
wound
that
grandly
trusting
nature
the
feeling
was
but
momentary
philip
run
after
the
vere
she
said
to
herself
it
true
there
no
mistake
about
it
and
she
ought
to
know
of
it
but
she
believe
without
proofs
what
proofs
can
i
get
i
wonder
and
her
scheming
brain
set
to
work
to
solve
this
problem
in
justice
to
her
it
must
be
admitted
she
had
a
good
deal
of
seeming
truth
on
her
side
sir
philip
name
somehow
got
connected
with
that
of
the
leading
actress
at
the
brilliant
and
more
people
than
lady
winsleigh
began
to
make
jocose
whispering
comments
on
his
stage
amour
comments
behind
his
back
which
he
was
totally
unaware
of
nobody
knew
quite
how
the
rumor
had
first
been
started
sir
francis
lennox
seemed
to
know
a
good
deal
about
it
and
he
was
an
intimate
of
the
vere
magic
circle
of
attraction
and
though
they
talked
no
one
ventured
to
say
anything
to
sir
philip
himself
the
only
two
among
his
friends
who
would
have
spoken
out
honestly
were
beau
lovelace
and
lorimer
and
these
were
absent
one
evening
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
sir
philip
went
out
after
the
late
dinner
before
leaving
he
kissed
his
wife
tenderly
and
told
her
on
no
account
to
sit
up
for
him
he
and
neville
were
going
to
attend
to
a
little
matter
of
business
which
might
detain
them
longer
than
they
could
calculate
after
they
had
gone
thelma
resigned
herself
to
a
lonely
evening
and
stirring
the
fire
in
the
to
a
cheerful
blaze
she
sat
down
beside
it
first
she
amused
herself
by
reading
over
some
letters
recently
received
from
her
father
and
then
yielding
to
a
sudden
fancy
she
drew
her
from
the
corner
where
it
always
stood
and
set
it
in
motion
she
had
little
time
for
spinning
now
but
she
never
quite
gave
it
up
and
as
the
low
familiar
whirring
sound
hummed
pleasantly
on
her
ears
she
smiled
thinking
how
quaint
and
almost
incongruous
her
simple
implement
of
industry
looked
among
all
the
luxurious
furniture
and
costly
by
which
she
was
surrounded
i
ought
to
have
one
of
my
old
gowns
on
she
half
murmured
glancing
down
at
the
silk
robe
she
wore
i
am
too
fine
to
spin
and
she
almost
laughed
as
the
wheel
flew
round
swiftly
under
her
graceful
manipulations
listening
to
its
whirr
whirr
whirr
she
scarcely
heard
a
sudden
knock
at
the
and
was
quite
startled
when
the
servant
morris
announced
sir
francis
lennox
surprised
she
rose
from
her
seat
at
the
with
a
slight
air
of
hauteur
sir
francis
who
had
never
in
his
life
seen
a
lady
of
title
and
fashion
in
london
engaged
in
the
primitive
occupation
of
spinning
was
entirely
delighted
with
the
picture
before
him
the
tall
lovely
woman
with
her
gold
hair
and
shimmering
blue
draperies
standing
with
such
stateliness
beside
the
simple
wooden
wheel
the
antique
emblem
of
household
industry
instinctively
he
thought
of
marguerite
but
marguerite
as
a
crowned
queen
superior
to
all
temptations
of
either
man
or
fiend
sir
philip
is
out
she
said
as
she
suffered
him
to
take
her
hand
so
i
was
aware
returned
lennox
easily
i
saw
him
a
little
while
ago
at
the
door
of
the
brilliant
theatre
she
turned
very
pale
then
controlling
the
rapid
beating
of
her
heart
by
a
strong
effort
she
forced
a
careless
smile
and
said
bravely
did
you
i
am
very
glad
for
he
will
have
some
amusement
there
perhaps
and
that
will
do
him
good
he
has
been
working
so
hard
she
paused
he
said
nothing
and
she
went
on
more
cheerfully
still
is
it
not
a
very
dismal
wet
evening
yes
and
you
must
be
cold
will
you
have
some
tea
drawled
sir
francis
staring
at
her
admiringly
if
it
not
too
much
trouble
oh
no
said
thelma
why
should
it
be
and
she
rang
the
bell
and
gave
the
order
sir
francis
sank
lazily
back
in
an
easy
chair
and
stroked
his
moustache
slowly
he
knew
that
his
random
hit
about
the
theatre
had
struck
home
but
she
allowed
the
arrow
to
pierce
and
possibly
wound
her
heart
without
showing
any
outward
sign
of
discomposure
a
plucky
woman
he
considered
and
wondered
how
he
should
make
his
next
move
she
meanwhile
smiled
at
him
frankly
and
gave
a
light
twirl
to
her
you
see
she
said
i
was
amusing
myself
this
evening
by
imagining
that
i
was
once
more
at
home
in
norway
pray
do
let
me
interrupt
the
amusement
he
responded
with
a
sleepy
look
of
satisfaction
shooting
from
beneath
his
eyelids
go
on
spinning
lady
errington
i
never
seen
any
one
spin
before
at
that
moment
morris
appeared
with
the
tea
and
handed
it
to
sir
francis
thelma
took
none
and
as
the
servant
retired
she
quietly
resumed
her
occupation
there
was
a
short
silence
only
broken
by
the
hum
of
the
wheel
sir
francis
sipped
his
tea
with
a
meditative
air
and
studied
the
fair
woman
before
him
as
critically
as
he
would
have
studied
a
picture
i
hope
i
not
in
your
way
he
asked
suddenly
she
looked
up
surprised
oh
no
only
i
am
sorry
philip
is
not
here
to
talk
to
you
it
would
be
so
much
pleasanter
would
it
he
murmured
rather
dubiously
and
smiling
well
i
shall
be
quite
contented
if
you
will
talk
to
me
lady
errington
ah
but
i
am
not
at
all
clever
in
conversation
responded
thelma
quite
seriously
i
am
sure
you
as
well
as
many
others
must
have
noticed
that
i
never
do
seem
to
say
exactly
the
right
thing
to
please
everybody
is
it
not
very
unfortunate
he
laughed
a
little
i
have
yet
to
learn
in
what
way
you
do
not
please
everybody
he
said
dropping
his
voice
to
a
low
caressing
cadence
who
that
sees
you
does
not
admire
and
and
love
you
she
met
his
languorous
gaze
without
embarrassment
while
the
childlike
openness
of
her
regard
confused
and
slightly
shamed
him
admire
me
oh
yes
she
said
somewhat
plaintively
it
is
that
of
which
i
am
so
weary
because
god
has
made
one
pleasant
in
form
and
face
to
be
stared
at
and
whispered
about
and
have
all
one
dresses
copied
all
that
is
so
small
and
common
and
mean
and
does
vex
me
so
much
it
is
the
penalty
you
pay
for
being
beautiful
said
sir
francis
slowly
wondering
within
himself
at
the
extraordinary
incongruity
of
a
feminine
creature
who
was
actually
tired
of
admiration
she
made
no
reply
the
wheel
went
round
faster
than
before
presently
lennox
set
aside
his
emptied
cup
and
drawing
his
chair
a
little
closer
to
hers
asked
when
does
errington
return
i
can
not
tell
you
she
answered
he
said
that
he
might
be
late
neville
is
with
him
there
was
another
silence
lady
errington
said
sir
francis
abruptly
pray
excuse
me
i
speak
as
a
friend
and
in
your
interests
how
long
is
this
to
last
the
wheel
stopped
she
raised
her
eyes
they
were
grave
and
steady
i
do
not
understand
you
she
returned
quietly
what
is
it
that
you
mean
he
hesitated
then
went
on
with
lowered
eyelids
and
a
i
mean
what
all
our
set
talking
about
errington
queer
fancy
for
that
actress
at
the
brilliant
thelma
still
gazed
at
him
fixedly
it
is
a
mistake
she
said
resolutely
altogether
a
mistake
and
as
you
are
his
friend
sir
francis
you
will
please
contradict
this
report
which
is
wrong
and
may
do
philip
harm
it
has
no
truth
in
it
at
all
no
truth
exclaimed
lennox
it
true
as
gospel
lady
errington
sorry
for
it
but
your
husband
is
deceiving
you
most
shamefully
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
she
cried
springing
upright
and
facing
him
then
she
stopped
and
grew
very
pale
but
she
kept
her
eyes
upon
him
how
bright
they
were
what
a
chilling
pride
glittered
in
their
depths
you
are
in
error
she
said
coldly
if
it
is
wrong
to
visit
this
theatre
you
speak
of
why
are
you
so
often
seen
there
and
why
is
not
some
harm
said
of
it
is
not
your
place
to
speak
against
my
husband
it
is
shameful
and
treacherous
you
do
forget
yourself
most
wickedly
and
she
moved
to
leave
the
room
but
sir
francis
interposed
lady
errington
he
said
very
gently
do
be
hard
upon
me
pray
forgive
me
of
course
i
no
business
to
speak
but
how
can
i
help
it
when
i
hear
every
one
at
the
clubs
discussing
you
and
pitying
you
impossible
to
listen
quite
unmoved
i
the
least
among
your
friends
i
know
but
i
ca
bear
this
sort
of
thing
to
go
on
the
whole
affair
will
be
dished
up
in
the
society
papers
next
and
he
paced
the
room
half
impatiently
a
very
expression
of
friendly
concern
and
sympathy
on
his
features
thelma
stood
motionless
a
little
bewildered
her
head
throbbed
achingly
and
there
was
a
sick
sensation
of
numbness
creeping
about
her
i
tell
you
it
is
all
wrong
she
repeated
with
an
effort
i
do
not
understand
why
these
people
at
the
clubs
should
talk
of
me
or
pity
me
i
do
not
need
any
pity
my
husband
is
all
goodness
and
truth
she
stopped
and
gathered
courage
as
she
went
on
yes
he
is
better
braver
nobler
than
all
other
men
in
the
world
it
seems
to
me
he
gives
me
all
the
joy
of
my
life
each
day
and
night
i
thank
god
for
the
blessing
of
his
love
she
paused
again
sir
francis
turned
and
looked
at
her
steadily
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
her
for
she
advanced
eagerly
a
sweet
color
flushing
the
pallor
of
her
skin
you
can
do
so
much
for
me
if
you
will
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
you
can
tell
all
these
people
who
talk
so
foolishly
that
they
are
wrong
tell
them
how
happy
i
am
and
that
my
philip
has
never
deceived
me
in
any
matter
great
or
small
never
he
asked
with
a
slight
sneer
you
are
sure
sure
she
answered
bravely
he
would
keep
nothing
from
me
that
it
was
necessary
or
good
for
me
to
know
and
i
oh
i
might
pass
all
my
life
in
striving
to
please
him
and
yet
i
should
never
never
be
worthy
of
all
his
tenderness
and
goodness
and
that
he
goes
many
times
to
a
theatre
without
me
what
is
it
a
mere
nothing
a
trifle
to
laugh
at
it
is
not
needful
to
tell
me
of
such
a
small
circumstance
as
she
spoke
she
smiled
her
form
seemed
to
dilate
with
a
sort
of
inner
confidence
and
rapture
sir
francis
stared
at
her
half
shamed
half
savage
the
beautiful
appealing
face
bright
with
simple
trust
roused
him
to
no
sort
of
manly
respect
or
forbearance
the
very
touch
of
the
hand
she
had
laid
so
innocently
on
his
arm
stung
his
passion
as
with
a
lash
as
he
had
said
he
was
fond
of
hunting
he
had
chased
the
unconscious
deer
all
through
the
summer
and
now
that
it
had
turned
to
bay
with
such
pitiful
mildness
and
sweet
pleading
why
not
draw
the
knife
across
its
slim
throat
without
mercy
really
lady
errington
he
said
at
last
sarcastically
your
wifely
enthusiasm
and
confidence
are
indeed
charming
but
unfortunately
the
proofs
are
all
against
you
truth
is
truth
however
much
you
may
wish
to
blind
your
eyes
to
its
manifestations
i
sincerely
wish
sir
philip
were
present
to
hear
your
eloquent
praises
of
him
instead
of
being
where
he
most
undoubtedly
is
in
the
arms
of
violet
vere
as
he
said
these
words
she
started
away
from
him
and
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
as
though
to
shut
out
some
discordant
sound
her
eyes
glowed
feverishly
a
cold
shiver
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
that
is
false
false
she
muttered
in
a
low
choked
voice
how
can
you
how
dare
you
she
ceased
and
with
a
swaying
bewildered
movement
as
though
she
were
blind
she
fell
senseless
at
his
feet
in
one
second
he
was
kneeling
beside
her
he
raised
her
head
on
his
arm
he
gazed
eagerly
on
her
fair
still
features
a
dark
contraction
of
his
brows
showed
that
his
thoughts
were
not
altogether
righteous
ones
suddenly
he
laid
her
down
again
gently
and
springing
to
the
door
locked
it
returning
he
once
more
lifted
her
in
a
position
and
encircling
her
with
his
arms
drew
her
close
to
his
breast
and
kissed
her
he
was
in
no
hurry
for
her
to
recover
she
looked
very
beautiful
she
was
helpless
she
was
in
his
power
the
silvery
of
the
clock
on
the
striking
eleven
startled
him
a
little
he
listened
painfully
he
thought
he
heard
some
one
trying
the
handle
of
the
door
he
had
locked
again
again
he
kissed
those
pale
unconscious
lips
presently
a
slight
shiver
ran
through
her
frame
she
sighed
and
a
little
moan
escaped
her
gradually
as
warmth
and
sensation
returned
to
her
she
felt
the
pressure
of
his
embrace
and
murmured
philip
darling
you
have
come
back
earlier
i
thought
here
she
opened
her
eyes
and
met
those
of
sir
francis
who
was
eagerly
bending
over
her
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
alarm
and
strove
to
rise
he
held
her
still
more
closely
thelma
dear
dearest
thelma
let
me
comfort
you
let
me
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
and
before
she
could
divine
his
intent
he
pressed
his
lips
passionately
on
her
pale
cheek
with
a
cry
she
tore
herself
violently
from
his
arms
and
sprang
to
her
feet
trembling
in
every
limb
what
what
is
this
she
exclaimed
wrathfully
are
you
mad
and
still
weak
and
confused
from
her
recent
attack
of
faintness
she
pushed
back
her
hair
from
her
brows
and
regarded
him
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
horror
he
flushed
deeply
and
set
his
lips
hard
i
dare
say
i
am
he
answered
with
a
bitter
laugh
in
fact
i
know
i
am
you
see
i
betrayed
my
miserable
secret
will
you
forgive
me
lady
errington
thelma
he
drew
nearer
to
her
and
his
eyes
darkened
with
restrained
passion
matchless
beauty
adorable
woman
as
you
are
will
you
not
pardon
my
crime
if
crime
it
be
the
crime
of
loving
you
for
i
do
love
you
heaven
only
knows
how
utterly
and
desperately
she
stood
mute
white
almost
rigid
with
that
strange
look
of
horror
frozen
as
it
were
upon
her
features
emboldened
by
her
silence
he
approached
and
caught
her
hand
she
wrenched
it
from
his
grasp
and
motioned
him
from
her
with
a
gesture
of
such
royal
contempt
that
he
quailed
before
her
all
suddenly
the
of
her
speech
were
loosened
the
rising
tide
of
burning
indignation
that
in
its
very
force
had
held
her
dumb
and
motionless
now
broke
forth
unrestrainedly
o
god
she
cried
impetuously
a
magnificent
glory
of
disdain
flashing
in
her
eyes
what
is
this
that
calls
itself
a
man
this
thief
of
honor
this
pretended
friend
what
have
i
done
sir
that
you
should
put
such
deep
disgrace
as
your
upon
me
what
have
i
that
you
thus
dare
to
outrage
me
by
the
pollution
of
your
touch
i
the
wife
of
the
noblest
gentleman
in
the
land
ah
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
it
is
you
who
speak
against
my
husband
she
smiled
scornfully
then
with
more
calmness
continued
you
will
leave
my
house
sir
at
once
and
never
presume
to
enter
it
again
and
she
stepped
towards
the
bell
he
looked
at
her
with
an
evil
leer
stop
a
moment
he
said
coolly
just
one
moment
before
you
ring
pray
consider
the
servant
can
not
possibly
enter
as
the
door
is
locked
you
to
lock
the
door
she
exclaimed
a
sudden
fear
chilling
her
heart
as
she
remembered
similar
manoeuvres
on
the
part
of
the
reverend
dyceworthy
then
another
thought
crossed
her
mind
and
she
began
to
retreat
towards
a
large
painted
panel
of
venus
disporting
among
cupids
and
dolphins
in
the
sea
sir
francis
sprang
to
her
side
and
caught
her
arm
in
an
iron
grip
his
face
was
aflame
with
baffled
spite
and
vindictiveness
yes
i
he
muttered
with
triumphant
malice
and
i
dared
do
more
than
that
you
lay
unconscious
in
my
arms
you
beautiful
bewitching
thelma
and
i
kissed
you
ay
fifty
times
you
can
never
undo
those
kisses
you
can
never
forget
that
lips
as
well
as
your
husband
have
rested
on
yours
i
have
had
that
much
joy
that
shall
never
be
taken
away
from
me
and
if
i
choose
even
now
and
he
gripped
her
more
closely
yes
even
now
i
will
kiss
you
in
spite
of
you
who
is
to
prevent
me
i
will
force
you
to
love
me
thelma
driven
to
bay
she
struck
him
with
all
her
force
in
the
face
across
the
eyes
traitor
liar
coward
she
gasped
breathlessly
let
me
go
smarting
with
the
pain
of
the
blow
he
unconsciously
loosened
his
grasp
she
rushed
to
the
venus
panel
and
to
his
utter
discomfiture
and
amazement
he
saw
it
open
and
close
behind
her
she
disappeared
suddenly
and
noiselessly
as
if
by
magic
with
a
fierce
exclamation
he
threw
his
whole
weight
against
that
secret
sliding
door
it
resisted
all
his
efforts
he
searched
for
the
spring
by
which
it
must
have
opened
the
whole
panel
was
perfectly
smooth
and
apparently
solid
and
the
painted
venus
reclining
on
her
dolphin
back
seemed
as
though
she
smiled
mockingly
at
his
rage
and
disappointment
while
he
was
examining
it
he
heard
the
sudden
sharp
and
continuous
ringing
of
an
electric
bell
somewhere
in
the
house
and
with
a
guilty
flush
on
his
face
he
sprang
to
the
door
and
unlocked
it
he
was
just
in
time
for
scarcely
had
he
turned
the
key
when
morris
made
his
appearance
that
venerable
servitor
looked
round
the
room
in
evident
surprise
did
her
ladyship
ring
he
inquired
his
eyes
roving
everywhere
in
search
of
his
mistress
sir
francis
collected
his
wits
and
forced
himself
to
seem
composed
no
he
said
coolly
rang
he
adopted
this
falsehood
as
a
means
of
exit
call
a
hansom
will
you
and
he
sauntered
easily
into
the
hall
and
got
on
his
hat
and
morris
was
rather
bewildered
but
obedient
to
the
command
blew
the
summoning
which
was
promptly
answered
sir
francis
tossed
him
half
a
crown
and
entered
the
vehicle
which
clattered
away
with
him
in
the
direction
of
cromwell
road
stopping
at
a
particular
house
in
a
side
street
leading
from
thence
he
bade
the
cabman
wait
and
ascending
the
steps
busied
himself
for
some
moments
in
scribbling
something
rapidly
in
pencil
on
a
leaf
of
his
by
the
light
of
the
in
the
doorway
he
then
gave
a
loud
knock
and
inquired
of
the
servant
who
answered
it
is
in
yes
sir
the
reply
came
rather
hesitatingly
but
he
having
a
party
and
in
fact
the
scraping
of
violins
and
the
shuffle
of
dancing
feet
were
distinctly
audible
overhead
oh
well
just
mention
my
name
sir
francis
lennox
say
i
will
not
detain
him
more
than
five
minutes
he
entered
and
was
ushered
into
a
small
while
the
maid
went
to
deliver
her
message
he
caught
sight
of
his
own
reflection
in
a
round
mirror
over
the
and
his
face
darkened
as
he
saw
a
dull
red
ridge
across
his
forehead
the
mark
of
thelma
blow
the
of
her
scorn
a
few
minutes
passed
and
then
there
came
in
to
him
a
large
man
in
an
expensive
a
man
with
a
puffy
red
countenance
no
other
than
who
hailed
him
with
effusive
cordiality
my
dear
sir
francis
he
said
in
a
rich
thick
uncomfortable
voice
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
wo
you
come
upstairs
my
girls
are
having
a
little
informal
dance
just
among
themselves
and
their
own
young
friends
quite
simple
in
fact
an
unpretentious
little
affair
and
he
rubbed
his
fat
hands
on
which
twinkled
two
or
three
large
diamond
rings
but
we
shall
be
charmed
if
you
will
join
us
thanks
not
this
evening
returned
sir
francis
it
rather
too
late
i
should
not
have
intruded
upon
you
at
this
hour
but
i
thought
you
might
possibly
like
this
paragraph
for
the
and
he
held
out
with
a
careless
air
the
paper
on
which
he
had
scribbled
but
a
few
minutes
previously
smiled
and
fixed
a
pair
of
elegant
on
his
inflamed
crimson
nose
i
must
tell
you
though
he
observed
before
reading
that
it
is
too
late
for
this
week
at
any
rate
we
gone
to
press
already
never
mind
returned
sir
francis
indifferently
next
week
will
do
as
well
and
he
furtively
watched
while
he
perused
the
pencilled
scrawl
that
gentleman
however
as
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
a
new
but
highly
successful
weekly
society
journal
was
far
too
dignified
and
to
allow
his
countenance
to
betray
his
feelings
he
merely
remarked
as
he
folded
up
the
little
slip
very
carefully
very
smart
very
smart
indeed
authentic
of
course
sir
francis
drew
himself
up
haughtily
you
doubt
my
word
oh
dear
no
declared
hastily
venturing
to
lay
a
soothing
hand
on
sir
francis
shoulder
your
position
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
naturally
you
be
able
to
secure
correct
information
you
ca
help
it
i
assure
you
the
is
infinitely
obliged
to
you
for
a
great
many
and
socially
exciting
paragraphs
only
you
see
i
myself
should
never
have
thought
that
so
extreme
a
follower
of
the
exploded
old
doctrine
of
noblesse
oblige
as
sir
philip
would
have
started
on
such
a
new
line
of
action
at
all
but
of
course
we
are
all
mortal
and
he
shook
his
round
thick
head
with
leering
sagacity
well
he
continued
after
a
pause
this
shall
go
in
without
fail
next
week
i
promise
you
you
can
send
me
a
hundred
copies
of
the
issue
said
sir
francis
taking
up
his
hat
to
go
i
suppose
you
not
afraid
of
an
action
for
libel
laughed
nay
he
roared
the
idea
seemed
so
exquisitely
suited
to
his
sense
of
humor
afraid
my
dear
fellow
there
nothing
i
should
like
better
it
would
establish
the
and
make
my
fortune
i
would
even
go
to
prison
with
pleasure
prison
for
a
misdemeanant
as
i
should
most
probably
be
termed
is
perfectly
endurable
he
laughed
again
and
escorted
sir
francis
to
the
where
he
shook
hands
heartily
you
are
sure
you
wo
come
upstairs
and
join
us
no
ah
i
see
you
have
a
cab
waiting
and
the
door
being
closed
upon
him
sir
francis
his
cab
and
was
driven
straight
to
his
bachelor
lodgings
in
piccadilly
he
was
in
a
better
humor
with
himself
now
though
he
was
still
angrily
conscious
of
a
smart
throbbing
across
the
eyes
where
thelma
ringed
hand
had
struck
him
he
found
a
brief
note
from
lady
winsleigh
awaiting
him
it
ran
as
follows
you
playing
a
losing
game
this
time
she
will
believe
nothing
without
proofs
and
even
then
it
will
be
difficult
you
had
better
drop
the
pursuit
i
fancy
for
once
a
woman
reputation
will
escape
you
he
smiled
bitterly
as
he
read
these
last
words
not
while
a
society
paper
exists
he
said
to
himself
as
long
as
there
are
editors
willing
to
accept
the
word
of
a
responsible
man
of
position
for
any
report
the
chastest
diana
that
ever
lived
shall
not
escape
calumny
she
wants
proofs
does
she
she
shall
have
them
by
jove
she
shall
and
instead
of
going
to
bed
he
went
off
to
a
bijou
villa
in
wood
an
elegantly
appointed
little
place
which
he
rented
and
maintained
and
where
the
popular
personage
known
as
violet
vere
basked
in
the
very
lap
of
luxury
meanwhile
thelma
paced
up
and
down
her
own
boudoir
into
which
she
had
escaped
through
the
sliding
panel
which
had
baffled
her
admirer
her
whole
frame
trembled
as
she
thought
of
the
indignity
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
during
her
brief
unconsciousness
her
face
burned
with
bitter
shame
she
felt
as
if
she
were
somehow
poisonously
infected
by
those
hateful
kisses
of
lennox
all
her
womanly
and
wifely
instincts
were
outraged
her
first
impulse
was
to
tell
her
husband
everything
the
instant
he
returned
it
was
she
who
had
rung
the
bell
which
had
startled
sir
francis
and
she
was
surprised
that
her
summons
was
not
answered
she
rang
again
and
britta
appeared
i
wanted
morris
said
thelma
quickly
he
thought
it
was
the
bell
responded
britta
meekly
for
her
fröken
looked
very
angry
i
saw
him
in
the
hall
just
now
letting
out
sir
francis
lennox
has
he
gone
demanded
thelma
eagerly
britta
wonder
increased
yes
fröken
thelma
caught
her
arm
tell
morris
never
never
to
let
him
inside
the
house
again
and
her
blue
eyes
flashed
wrathfully
he
is
a
wicked
man
britta
you
do
not
know
how
wicked
he
is
oh
yes
i
do
and
britta
regarded
her
mistress
very
steadfastly
i
know
quite
well
but
then
i
must
not
speak
if
i
dared
i
could
tell
you
some
strange
things
dear
fröken
but
you
will
not
hear
me
you
know
you
do
not
wish
me
to
talk
about
your
grand
new
friends
fröken
but
she
paused
timidly
oh
britta
dear
said
thelma
affectionately
taking
her
hand
you
know
they
are
not
so
much
my
friends
as
the
friends
of
sir
philip
and
for
this
reason
i
must
never
listen
to
anything
against
them
do
you
not
see
of
course
their
ways
seem
strange
to
us
but
then
life
in
london
is
so
different
to
life
in
norway
and
we
can
not
all
at
once
understand
she
broke
off
sighing
a
little
then
she
resumed
now
you
will
give
morris
my
message
britta
and
then
come
to
me
in
my
bedroom
i
am
tired
and
philip
said
i
was
not
to
wait
up
for
him
britta
departed
and
thelma
went
rather
slowly
it
was
now
nearly
midnight
and
she
felt
languid
and
weary
her
reflections
began
to
take
a
new
turn
suppose
she
told
her
husband
all
that
had
occurred
he
would
most
certainly
go
to
sir
francis
and
punish
him
in
some
way
there
might
then
be
a
quarrel
in
which
philip
might
suffer
and
all
sorts
of
evil
consequences
would
perhaps
result
from
her
want
of
reticence
if
on
the
other
hand
she
said
nothing
and
simply
refused
to
receive
lennox
would
not
her
husband
think
such
conduct
on
her
part
strange
she
puzzled
over
these
questions
till
her
head
ached
and
finally
resolved
to
keep
her
own
counsel
for
the
present
after
what
had
happened
sir
francis
would
most
probably
not
intrude
himself
again
into
her
presence
i
will
ask
lorimer
what
is
best
to
do
she
thought
she
is
old
and
wise
and
she
will
know
that
night
as
she
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
and
britta
threw
the
warm
over
her
she
shivered
a
little
and
asked
is
it
not
very
cold
britta
very
responded
her
little
maid
and
it
is
beginning
to
snow
thelma
looked
wistful
it
is
all
snow
and
darkness
now
at
the
altenfjord
she
said
britta
smiled
yes
indeed
fröken
we
are
better
off
here
than
there
perhaps
replied
thelma
a
little
musingly
and
then
she
settled
herself
as
though
to
sleep
britta
kissed
her
hand
and
retired
noiselessly
when
she
had
gone
thelma
opened
her
eyes
and
lay
broad
awake
looking
at
the
flicker
of
rosy
light
flung
on
the
ceiling
from
the
little
suspended
lamp
in
her
oratory
all
snow
and
darkness
at
the
altenfjord
how
strange
the
picture
seemed
she
thought
of
her
mother
sepulchre
how
cold
and
dreary
it
must
be
she
could
see
in
fancy
the
long
pendent
icicles
fringing
the
entrance
to
the
tomb
the
spot
where
she
and
philip
had
first
met
she
could
almost
hear
the
slow
sullen
plash
of
the
black
fjord
against
the
shore
her
maiden
life
in
norway
her
school
days
at
arles
these
were
now
like
dreams
dreams
that
had
passed
away
long
long
ago
the
whole
tenor
of
her
existence
had
changed
she
was
a
wife
she
was
soon
to
be
a
mother
and
with
this
near
future
of
new
and
sacred
joy
before
her
why
did
she
so
persistently
look
backward
to
the
past
as
she
lay
quiet
watching
the
glimmering
light
upon
the
wall
it
seemed
as
though
her
room
were
suddenly
filled
with
shadowy
forms
she
saw
her
mother
sweet
sad
suffering
face
then
her
father
sturdy
figure
and
fine
frank
features
then
came
the
flitting
shape
of
the
hapless
sigurd
whose
plaintive
voice
she
almost
imagined
she
could
hear
and
feeling
that
she
was
growing
foolishly
nervous
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
in
vain
her
mind
began
to
work
on
a
far
more
unpleasing
train
of
thought
why
did
not
philip
return
where
was
he
as
though
some
mocking
devil
had
answered
her
the
words
in
the
arms
of
violet
vere
as
uttered
by
sir
francis
lennox
recurred
to
her
overcome
by
her
restlessness
she
started
up
she
determined
to
get
out
of
bed
and
put
on
her
and
read
when
her
quick
ears
caught
the
sound
of
steps
coming
up
the
she
recognized
her
husband
firm
tread
and
understood
that
he
was
followed
by
neville
whose
was
on
the
floor
above
she
listened
attentively
they
were
talking
together
in
low
tones
on
the
landing
outside
her
door
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
said
sir
philip
she
will
have
to
know
some
day
your
wife
for
god
sake
do
tell
her
neville
voice
replied
such
a
disgraceful
here
his
words
sank
to
a
whisper
and
thelma
could
not
distinguish
them
another
minute
and
her
husband
entered
with
soft
precaution
fearing
to
awake
her
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
welcome
him
and
he
hastened
to
her
with
an
exclamation
of
tenderness
and
pleasure
my
darling
not
asleep
yet
she
smiled
but
there
was
something
very
piteous
in
her
smile
had
the
dim
light
enabled
him
to
perceive
it
no
not
yet
philip
and
yet
i
think
i
have
been
dreaming
of
the
altenfjord
ah
it
must
be
cold
there
now
he
answered
lightly
it
cold
enough
here
in
all
conscience
there
is
a
bitter
east
wind
and
snow
is
falling
she
heard
this
account
of
the
weather
with
almost
morbid
interest
her
thoughts
instantly
betook
themselves
again
to
norway
and
dwelt
there
to
the
last
before
her
aching
eyes
closed
in
the
slumber
she
so
sorely
needed
she
seemed
to
be
carried
away
in
fancy
to
a
weird
stretch
of
landscape
where
she
stood
entirely
alone
vaguely
wondering
at
the
dreary
scene
how
strange
it
seems
she
murmured
almost
aloud
all
snow
and
darkness
at
the
altenfjord
chapter
xxv
le
temps
où
nous
nous
sommes
aimés
guère
duré
jeune
fille
il
a
passé
comme
un
coup
de
vent
breton
the
next
morning
dawned
cold
and
dismal
a
dense
yellow
fog
hung
over
the
metropolis
like
a
pall
the
street
lamps
were
lighted
but
their
flare
scarcely
illumined
the
thoroughfares
and
the
chill
of
the
air
penetrated
into
the
warmest
rooms
and
made
itself
felt
even
by
the
side
of
the
brightest
fires
sir
philip
woke
with
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
headache
and
depression
and
grumbled
as
surely
every
englishman
has
a
right
to
grumble
at
the
uncompromising
wretchedness
of
his
country
winter
climate
his
humor
was
not
improved
when
a
telegram
arrived
before
breakfast
summoning
him
in
haste
to
a
dull
town
in
one
of
the
midland
counties
on
pressing
business
connected
with
his
candidature
for
parliament
what
a
bore
he
exclaimed
showing
the
missive
to
his
wife
i
go
and
i
sha
be
able
to
get
back
tonight
you
be
all
alone
thelma
i
wish
you
go
to
the
winsleighs
why
said
thelma
quietly
i
shall
much
prefer
to
be
here
i
do
not
mind
philip
i
am
accustomed
to
be
alone
something
in
her
tone
struck
him
as
particularly
sad
and
he
looked
at
her
intently
now
my
darling
he
said
suddenly
if
this
parliamentary
bother
is
making
you
feel
worried
or
vexed
in
any
way
i
throw
it
all
up
by
jove
i
will
and
he
drew
her
into
his
warm
embrace
after
all
he
added
with
a
laugh
what
does
it
matter
the
country
can
get
on
without
me
thelma
smiled
a
little
you
must
not
talk
so
foolishly
philip
she
said
tenderly
it
is
wrong
to
begin
a
thing
of
importance
and
not
go
through
with
it
and
i
am
not
worried
or
vexed
at
all
what
would
people
say
of
me
if
i
your
wife
were
for
my
own
selfish
comfort
and
pleasure
of
having
you
always
with
me
to
prevent
you
from
taking
a
good
place
among
the
men
of
your
nation
indeed
i
should
deserve
much
blame
and
so
though
it
is
a
gloomy
day
for
you
poor
boy
you
must
go
to
this
place
where
you
are
wanted
and
i
shall
think
of
you
all
the
time
you
are
gone
and
shall
be
so
happy
to
welcome
you
home
and
she
kissed
and
clung
to
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
all
that
day
philip
was
haunted
by
the
remembrance
of
the
lingering
tenderness
of
her
farewell
embrace
by
ten
he
was
gone
taking
neville
with
him
and
after
her
household
duties
were
over
thelma
prepared
herself
to
go
and
lunch
with
old
lorimer
and
see
what
she
would
advise
concerning
the
affair
of
sir
francis
lennox
but
at
the
same
time
she
resolved
that
nothing
should
make
her
speak
of
the
reports
that
were
afloat
about
her
husband
and
violet
vere
i
know
it
is
all
false
she
said
to
herself
over
and
over
again
and
the
people
here
are
as
silly
as
the
peasants
in
bosekop
ready
to
believe
any
untruth
so
long
as
it
gives
them
something
to
talk
about
but
they
may
chatter
as
they
please
i
shall
not
say
one
word
not
even
to
philip
for
it
would
seem
as
if
i
mistrusted
him
thus
she
put
away
all
the
morbid
fancies
that
threatened
to
oppress
her
and
became
almost
cheerful
and
while
she
made
her
simple
plans
for
pleasantly
passing
the
long
dull
day
of
her
husband
enforced
absence
her
friend
lady
winsleigh
was
making
arrangements
of
a
very
different
nature
her
ladyship
had
received
a
telegram
from
sir
francis
lennox
that
morning
the
pink
missive
had
apparently
put
her
in
an
excellent
humor
though
after
reading
it
she
crumpled
it
up
and
threw
it
in
the
basket
from
which
receptacle
louise
rénaud
her
astute
attendant
half
an
hour
later
extracted
it
secreting
it
in
her
own
pocket
for
private
perusal
at
leisure
she
ordered
her
brougham
saying
she
was
going
out
on
business
and
before
departing
she
took
from
her
certain
and
crammed
them
hastily
into
her
purse
a
purse
which
in
all
good
faith
she
handed
to
her
maid
to
put
in
her
sealskin
of
course
louise
managed
to
make
herself
aware
of
its
contents
but
when
her
ladyship
at
last
entered
her
carriage
her
unexpected
order
to
the
brilliant
theatre
strand
was
sufficient
to
startle
briggs
and
cause
him
to
exchange
surprise
signals
with
mamzelle
who
merely
smiled
a
prim
incomprehensible
smile
did
your
say
asked
briggs
dubiously
are
you
getting
deaf
briggs
responded
his
mistress
pleasantly
to
the
brilliant
theatre
she
raised
her
voice
and
spoke
with
distinct
emphasis
there
was
no
mistaking
her
briggs
touched
his
hat
in
the
same
instant
he
winked
at
louise
and
then
the
carriage
rolled
away
at
night
the
brilliant
theatre
is
a
pretty
little
place
comfortable
cosy
bright
and
deserving
of
its
name
in
broad
day
it
is
none
of
these
things
a
squalid
dreariness
seems
to
have
settled
upon
it
it
has
a
peculiar
atmosphere
of
its
own
an
atmosphere
dark
heavy
and
strangely
flavored
with
odors
of
escaping
gas
and
crushed
behind
the
scenes
these
odors
mingle
with
a
chronic
smell
of
beer
beer
which
the
stranger
sensitive
nose
detects
directly
in
spite
of
the
choking
clouds
of
dust
which
arise
from
the
boards
at
the
smallest
movement
of
any
part
of
the
painted
scenery
the
brilliant
had
gone
through
much
its
proprietors
never
realized
any
financial
profit
till
they
secured
violet
vere
with
her
came
prosperity
her
utter
absence
of
all
reserve
the
frankness
with
which
she
threw
modesty
to
the
winds
the
vigor
with
which
she
danced
a
regular
roaring
a
comic
song
of
the
lowest
type
by
way
of
accompaniment
the
energetic
manner
in
which
metaphorically
speaking
she
kicked
at
the
public
with
her
shapely
legs
all
this
overflow
of
genius
on
her
part
drew
crowds
to
the
brilliant
nightly
and
the
grateful
and
happy
managers
paid
her
a
handsome
salary
humored
all
her
caprices
and
stinted
and
snubbed
for
her
sake
all
the
rest
of
the
company
she
was
immensely
popular
the
golden
youth
of
london
raved
about
her
dyed
hair
painted
eyes
and
carmined
lips
even
her
voice
as
coarse
as
that
of
a
dustman
was
applauded
to
the
echo
and
her
dancing
excited
the
wildest
enthusiasm
dukes
sent
her
presents
of
diamond
ornaments
gifts
of
value
which
they
would
have
possibly
refused
to
their
own
wives
and
daughters
royal
highnesses
thought
it
no
shame
to
be
seen
lounging
near
her
stage
door
in
short
she
was
in
the
zenith
of
her
career
and
being
thoroughly
unprincipled
audaciously
insolent
and
wholly
without
a
conscience
she
enjoyed
herself
immensely
at
the
very
time
when
lady
winsleigh
carriage
was
nearing
the
strand
the
grand
morning
rehearsal
of
a
new
burlesque
was
on
at
the
brilliant
and
violet
harsh
tones
raised
to
a
sort
of
rough
masculine
roar
were
heard
all
over
the
theatre
as
she
issued
commands
or
made
complaints
according
to
her
changeful
humors
she
sat
in
an
elevated
position
above
the
stage
on
a
jutting
beam
of
wood
painted
to
resemble
the
gnarled
branch
of
a
tree
swinging
her
legs
to
and
fro
and
clinking
the
heels
of
her
shoes
together
in
time
to
the
mild
scraping
of
a
violin
the
player
whereof
was
trying
over
the
first
few
bars
of
the
new
jig
in
which
she
was
ere
long
to
distinguish
herself
she
was
a
handsome
woman
with
a
fine
fair
skin
and
large
full
dark
eyes
she
had
a
wide
mouth
which
nearly
always
on
the
grin
displayed
to
the
full
her
strong
white
teeth
her
figure
was
inclined
to
excessive
but
this
rather
endeared
her
to
her
admirers
than
otherwise
many
of
these
gentlemen
being
prone
to
describe
her
fleshly
charms
by
the
epithet
prime
as
though
she
were
a
fatting
pig
or
other
animal
getting
ready
for
killing
tommy
tommy
she
screeched
presently
are
you
going
to
sleep
do
you
expect
me
to
dance
to
a
dirge
you
lazy
devil
tommy
the
player
of
the
violin
paused
in
his
efforts
and
looked
up
drearily
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
lean
long
body
and
pinched
features
his
lips
had
a
curious
way
too
of
trembling
when
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
ready
to
cry
i
ca
help
it
he
said
slowly
i
do
know
it
yet
i
must
practice
it
a
bit
at
home
my
sight
not
so
good
as
it
used
to
be
such
a
pair
of
optics

my
mother
blacked
last
night
the
other
it
is

to
the
infinite
delight
of
all
the
supernumeraries
and
who
were
scattered
about
the
stage
talking
and
laughing
shut
up
tommy
she
continued
you
always
talking
about
your
eyesight
i
warn
you
if
you
say
too
much
about
it
you
lose
your
place
we
do
want

the
brilliant
put
down
you
catgut
screamer
and
fetch
me
a
pint
ask
for
the
vere
own
tipple
they
twig
tommy
obeyed
and
shuffled
off
on
his
errand
as
he
departed
a
little
man
with
a
very
red
face
wearing
a
hat
very
much
on
one
side
bounced
on
the
stage
as
if
some
one
had
thrown
him
there
like
a
ball
now
ladies
ladies
he
shouted
warningly
attention
once
again
please
the
last
figure
once
again
the
straggling
groups
scrambled
hastily
into
something
like
order
and
the
little
man
continued
one
two
three
advance
retreat
left
right
very
well
indeed
arms
up
a
little
more
miss

retire
one

swift
slide
to
the
left
wing
forward
round
take
hands
all
smile
please
this
general
smile
was
apparently
not
quite
satisfactory
for
he
repeated
persuasively
all
smile
please
so
round
again
more
quickly
now
break
the
circle
in
a
centre
enter
miss
vere
he
paused
growing
still
redder
in
the
face
and
demanded
where
is
miss
vere
he
was
standing
just
beneath
the
painted
bough
of
the
sham
tree
and
in
one
second
his
hat
was
dexterously
kicked
off
and
two
heels
met
with
a
click
round
his
neck
here
i
am
pickaninny
retorted
miss
vere
holding
him
fast
in
this
novel
embrace
amid
the
laughter
of
the
supers
you
getting
as
blind
as
tommy
steady
steady
now
donkey
steady
woa
and
in
a
thrice
she
stood
upright
one
foot
planted
firmly
on
each
of
his
shoulders
no
weight
am
i
darling
she
went
on
jeeringly
and
with
an
inimitably
derisive
air
she
put
up
an
and
surveyed
the
top
of
his
head
you
want
a
wig
my
dear
you
do
indeed
come
with
me
and
i
buy
you
one
to
suit
your
complexion
your
wife
know
you
and
with
a
vigorous
jump
she
sprang
down
from
her
position
managing
to
give
him
a
smart
hit
on
the
nose
as
she
did
so
and
leaping
to
the
centre
of
the
stage
she
posed
herself
to
commence
her
dance
when
tommy
came
creeping
back
in
his
slow
and
dismal
fashion
bearing
something
in
a
pewter
pot
that
the
ticket
she
cried
as
she
perceived
him
i
as
dry
as
a
whole
desert
give
it
here
and
she
snatched
the
mug
from
the
feeble
hand
of
her
messenger
and
began
drinking
eagerly
the
little
man
interposed
now
miss
vi
he
said
is
that
brandy
rather
so
returned
the
vere
with
a
knowing
wink
and
a
good
many
things
besides
it
a
mixture
the
own
ha
ha
might
be
the
name
of
a
regiment
and
she
buried
her
mouth
and
nose
again
in
the
tankard
look
here
said
the
little
man
again
why
not
wait
till
after
the
dance
it
bad
for
you
before
oh
is
it
indeed
screamed
violet
raising
her
face
which
became
suddenly
and
violently
flushed
o
good
lord
are
you
a
temperance
preacher
teach
your
granny
bad
for
me
say
another
word
and
i
box
your
ears

snivelling
idiot
who
makes
the
brilliant
draw

or
i
tell
me
that
you
staring
old
here
tommy
who
had
for
some
minutes
been
vainly
endeavoring
to
attract
her
attention
raised
his
weak
voice
to
a
feeble
shout
i
say
miss
vere
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
but
you
wo
listen
there
a
lady
waiting
to
see
you
a
what
she
asked
a
lady
continued
tommy
in
loud
tones
a
lady
of
title
wants
to
see
you
in
private
wo
detain
you
long
violet
vere
raised
her
pewter
mug
once
more
and
drained
off
its
contents
lord
ai
i
honored
she
said
smacking
her
lips
with
a
grin
a
lady
of
title
to
see
me
let
her
wait
now
then
and
snapping
her
fingers
she
began
her
dance
and
went
through
it
to
the
end
with
her
usual
vigor
and
frankness
when
she
had
finished
she
turned
to
the
man
who
had
watched
her
evolutions
with
much
delight
in
spite
of
the
abuse
she
had
heaped
upon
him
and
said
with
an
affected
smirking
drawl
show
the
lady
of
title
into
my
i
shall
be
ready
for
her
in
ten
minutes
be
sure
to
mention
that
i
am
very
shy
and
unaccustomed
to
company
and
giggling
gently
like
an
awkward
she
held
down
her
head
with
feigned
bashfulness
and
stepped
mincingly
across
the
stage
with
such
a
ludicrous
air
of
prim
propriety
that
all
her
associates
burst
out
laughing
and
applauded
her
vociferously
she
turned
and
curtsied
to
them
demurely
then
suddenly
raising
one
leg
in
a
horizontal
position
she
twirled
it
rapidly
in
their
faces
then
she
gave
a
little
shocked
cough
behind
her
hand
grinned
and
vanished
when
in
the
stipulated
ten
minutes
she
was
ready
to
receive
her
unknown
visitor
she
was
quite
transformed
she
had
arrayed
herself
in
a
trailing
gown
of
rich
black
velvet
fastened
at
the
side
with
jet
clasps
a
cluster
of
natural
innocent
white
violets
nestled
in
the
fall
of
spanish
lace
at
her
throat
her
face
was
pale
with
and
she
had
eaten
a
couple
of
scented
to
drown
the
smell
of
her
recent
she
reclined
gracefully
in
an
easy
chair
pretending
to
read
and
she
rose
with
an
admirably
acted
air
of
startled
surprise
as
one
of
the
errand
boys
belonging
to
the
brilliant
tapped
at
her
door
and
in
answer
to
her
come
in
announced
lady
winsleigh
a
faint
sweet
questioning
smile
played
on
the
vere
wide
mouth
i
am
not
aware
that
i
have
the
honor
of
she
began
modulating
her
voice
to
the
requirements
of
fashionable
society
and
wondering
within
herself
what
the
d
l
this
woman
in
the
silk
and
costume
wanted
lady
winsleigh
in
the
meantime
stared
at
her
with
cold
critical
eyes
she
is
positively
rather
handsome
she
thought
i
can
quite
imagine
a
certain
class
of
men
losing
their
heads
about
her
aloud
she
said
i
must
apologize
for
this
intrusion
miss
vere
i
dare
say
you
have
never
heard
my
name
i
am
not
fortunate
enough
to
be
famous
as
are
this
with
a
killing
satire
in
her
smile
may
i
sit
down
thanks
i
have
called
upon
you
in
the
hope
that
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
give
me
a
little
information
in
a
private
matter
a
matter
concerning
the
happiness
of
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
she
paused
violet
vere
sat
silent
after
a
minute
or
two
her
ladyship
continued
in
a
somewhat
embarrassed
manner
i
believe
you
know
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
am
also
acquainted
sir
philip
miss
vere
raised
her
eyes
with
charming
languor
and
a
slow
smile
oh
yes
he
visits
you
does
he
frequently
i
afraid
you
think
me
rude
and
inquisitive
continued
lady
winsleigh
with
a
coaxing
air
but
but
may
i
ask
anything
in
the
world
interrupted
violet
coolly
ask
away
but
not
bound
to
answer
lady
winsleigh
reddened
with
indignation
what
an
insulting
creature
she
thought
but
after
all
she
had
put
herself
in
her
present
position
and
she
could
not
very
well
complain
if
she
met
with
a
rebuff
she
made
another
effort
sir
francis
lennox
told
me
she
began
the
vere
interrupted
her
with
a
cheerful
laugh
oh
you
come
from
him
do
you
now
why
did
you
tell
me
that
at
first
it
all
right
you
a
great
friend
of
lennie
are
you
lady
winsleigh
sat
erect
and
haughty
a
deadly
chill
of
disgust
and
fear
at
her
heart
this
creature
called
her
quondam
lover
lennie
even
as
she
herself
had
done
and
she
the
proud
vain
woman
of
society
and
fashion
shuddered
at
the
idea
that
there
should
be
even
this
similarity
between
herself
and
the
thing
called
violet
vere
she
replied
stiffly
i
have
known
him
a
long
time
he
a
nice
fellow
went
on
miss
vere
easily
a
stingy
sometimes
but
never
mind
that
you
want
to
know
about
sir
philip
errington
and
i
tell
you
he
chosen
to
mix
himself
up
with
some
affairs
of
mine
what
affairs
asked
lady
winsleigh
rather
eagerly
they
do
concern
you
returned
miss
vere
calmly
and
we
talk
about
them
but
they
concern
sir
philip
or
he
thinks
they
do
and
insists
on
seeing
me
about
them
and
holding
long
conversations
which
bore
me
excessively
she
yawned
slightly
smothering
her
yawn
in
a
dainty
lace
handkerchief
and
then
went
on
he
a
moral
young
man
do
you
know
and
i
never
could
endure
moral
men
i
ca
get
on
with
them
at
all
then
you
do
like
him
questioned
lady
winsleigh
in
rather
a
disappointed
tone
no
i
do
said
the
vere
candidly
he
not
my
sort
but
lord
bless
you
i
know
how
he
getting
talked
about
because
he
comes
here
and
serve
him
right
too
he
should
meddle
with
my
business
she
paused
suddenly
and
drew
a
letter
from
her
pocket
laughed
and
tossed
it
across
the
table
you
can
read
that
if
you
like
she
said
indifferently
he
wrote
it
and
sent
it
round
to
me
last
night
lady
winsleigh
eyes
glistened
eagerly
she
recognized
bold
clear
hand
at
once
and
as
she
read
an
expression
of
triumph
played
on
her
features
she
looked
up
presently
and
said
have
you
any
further
use
for
this
letter
miss
vere
or
will
you
allow
me
to
keep
it
the
vere
seemed
slightly
suspicious
of
this
proposal
but
looked
amused
too
why
what
do
you
want
it
for
she
inquired
bluntly
to
tease
him
about
me
lady
winsleigh
forced
a
smile
well
perhaps
she
admitted
then
with
an
air
of
gentleness
and
simplicity
she
continued
i
think
miss
vere
with
you
that
it
is
very
wrong
of
sir
philip
very
absurd
of
him
in
fact
to
interfere
with
your
affairs
whatever
they
may
be
and
as
it
is
very
likely
annoying
to
you
it
interrupted
violet
decidedly
then
with
the
help
of
this
letter
which
really
really
excuse
me
for
saying
it
quite
compromises
him
and
her
ladyship
looked
amiably
concerned
about
it
i
might
perhaps
persuade
him
not
to
to
intrude
upon
you
you
understand
but
if
you
object
to
part
with
the
letter
never
mind
if
i
did
not
fear
to
offend
you
i
should
ask
you
to
exchange
it
for
for
something
more
well
let
us
say
something
more
substantial
do
beat
about
the
bush
said
violet
with
a
sudden
oblivion
of
her
company
manners
you
mean
money
lady
winsleigh
smiled
as
you
put
it
so
frankly
miss
vere
she
began
of
course
i
always
frank
returned
the
vere
with
a
loud
laugh
besides
what
the
good
of
pretending
money
the
only
thing
worth
having
it
pays
your
butcher
baker
and
dressmaker
and
how
are
you
to
get
along
if
you
pay
them
i
like
to
know
lord
if
all
the
letters
i
got
from
fools
were
paying
stock
instead
of
i
shut
up
shop
and
leave
the
brilliant
to
look
out
for
itself
lady
winsleigh
felt
she
had
gained
her
object
and
she
could
now
afford
to
be
gracious
that
would
be
a
great
loss
to
the
world
she
remarked
sweetly
an
immense
loss
london
could
scarcely
get
on
without
violet
vere
here
she
opened
her
purse
and
took
out
some
which
she
folded
and
slipped
inside
an
envelope
then
i
may
have
the
letter
she
continued
you
may
and
welcome
returned
violet
lady
winsleigh
instantly
held
out
the
envelope
which
she
as
instantly
clutched
especially
if
you
tell
sir
philip
errington
to
mind
his
own
business
she
paused
and
a
dark
flush
mounted
to
her
brow
one
of
those
sudden
flushes
that
purpled
rather
than
crimsoned
her
face
yes
she
repeated
as
he
a
friend
of
yours
just
tell
him
i
said
he
was
to
mind
his
own
business
lord
what
does
he
want
to
come
here
and
preach
at
me
for
i
do
want
his
sermons
moral
here
she
laughed
rather
hoarsely
i
as
moral
as
any
one
on
the
stage
who
says
i
not
take
all
round
there
not
a
soul
behind
the
footlights
more
open
and
than
i
am
and
her
eyes
flashed
defiantly
she
been
drinking
thought
lady
winsleigh
disgustedly
in
fact
the
vere
own
tipple
had
begun
to
take
its
usual
effect
which
was
to
make
the
vere
herself
both
blatant
and
boisterous
i
sure
said
her
ladyship
with
frigid
politeness
that
you
are
everything
that
is
quite
charming
miss
vere
i
have
a
great
respect
for
the
the
ornaments
of
the
english
stage
society
has
quite
thrown
down
its
former
barriers
you
know
the
members
of
your
profession
are
received
in
the
very
best
circles
i
ai
said
violet
with
ungrammatical
candor
your
irvings
and
your
terrys
your
mary
andersons
and
your
langtrys
they
good
enough
for
your
fine
and
get
more
invitations
out
than
they
can
accept
and
none
of
them
have
got
half
my
talent
i
tell
you
lord
bless
my
soul
if
they
respectable
enough
for
you
so
am
i
and
she
struck
her
hand
emphatically
on
the
table
lady
winsleigh
looked
at
her
with
a
slight
smile
i
must
really
say
she
said
rising
and
gathering
her
furs
about
her
i
could
talk
with
you
all
the
morning
miss
vere
but
i
have
so
many
engagements
besides
i
must
detain
i
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
reception
of
me
do
mention
it
and
violet
glanced
her
over
with
a
kind
of
sullen
sarcasm
i
bound
to
please
lennie
when
i
can
you
know
again
lady
winsleigh
shivered
a
little
but
forced
herself
to
shake
hands
with
the
notorious
i
shall
come
and
see
you
in
the
new
piece
she
said
graciously
i
always
take
a
box
on
first
nights
and
your
dancing
is
so
exquisite
the
very
poetry
of
motion
so
pleased
to
have
met
you
and
with
a
few
more
vague
compliments
and
remarks
about
the
weather
lady
winsleigh
took
her
departure
left
alone
the
actress
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
laughed
that
woman
up
to
some
mischief
she
exclaimed
sotto
voce
and
so
is
lennie
i
wonder
what
their
little
game
do
care
as
long
as
they
keep
the
errington
in
his
place
i
tired
of
him
why
does
he
meddle
with
affairs
her
brows
knitted
into
a
frown
as
if
he
or
anybody
else
could
persuade
me
to
go
back
to
she
paused
and
bit
her
lips
angrily
then
she
opened
the
envelope
lady
winsleigh
had
left
with
her
and
pulled
out
the
inside
let
me
see
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
not
bad
pay
on
the
whole
just
cover
the
bill
for
my
plush
mantle
hullo
who
there
some
one
knocked
at
her
door
come
in
she
cried
the
feeble
tommy
presented
himself
his
weak
mouth
trembled
more
than
ever
and
he
was
apparently
conscious
of
this
for
he
passed
his
hand
nervously
across
it
two
or
three
times
well
what
up
inquired
the
star
of
the
brilliant
fingering
her
as
she
spoke
miss
vere
stammered
tommy
i
venture
to
ask
you
a
favor
could
you
kindly
very
kindly
lend
me
ten
shillings
till
night
i
am
so
pressed
just
now
and
my
wife
is
ill
in
bed
and
he
stopped
and
his
eyes
sought
her
face
hopefully
yet
timidly
you
should
have
a
wife
tommy
averred
violet
with
blunt
frankness
wives
are
expensive
articles
besides
i
never
lend
i
never
give
except
to
public
charities
where
one
name
gets
mentioned
in
the
papers
i
obliged
to
do
that
you
know
by
way
of
advertisement
ten
shillings
why
i
ca
afford
ten
pence
my
bills
would
frighten
you
tommy
there
go
along
and
do
cry
for
goodness
sake
let
your
fiddle
cry
for
you
oh
miss
vere
once
more
pleaded
tommy
if
you
knew
how
my
wife
suffers
the
actress
rose
and
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
bother
your
wife
she
cried
angrily
and
you
too
look
out
or
i
tell
the
manager
we
got
a
beggar
at
the
brilliant
do
stare
at
me
like
that
go
to
the
d
l
with
you
tommy
slunk
off
abashed
and
trembling
and
the
vere
began
to
sing
or
rather
croak
a
low
comic
song
while
she
threw
over
her
shoulders
a
rich
mantle
glittering
with
embroidered
trimmings
and
poised
a
coquettish
paris
model
hat
on
her
thick
untwisted
coils
of
hair
thus
attired
she
passed
out
of
her
locking
the
door
behind
her
and
after
a
brief
conversation
with
the
jocose
acting
manager
whom
she
met
on
her
way
out
she
left
the
theatre
and
took
a
cab
to
the
criterion
where
the
young
duke
of
moorlands
her
latest
conquest
had
invited
her
to
a
sumptuous
luncheon
with
himself
and
friends
all
men
of
fashion
who
were
running
through
what
money
they
had
as
fast
as
they
could
go
lady
winsleigh
on
her
way
home
was
tormented
by
sundry
uncomfortable
thoughts
and
sharp
pricks
of
conscience
her
interview
with
violet
vere
had
instinctively
convinced
her
that
sir
philip
was
innocent
of
the
intrigue
imputed
to
him
and
yet
the
letter
she
had
now
in
her
possession
seemed
to
prove
him
guilty
and
though
she
felt
herself
to
be
playing
a
vile
part
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
trying
what
the
effect
would
be
of
this
compromising
document
on
thelma
trusting
mind
it
was
undoubtedly
a
very
incriminating
epistle
any
lawyer
would
have
said
as
much
while
blandly
pocketing
his
fee
for
saying
it
it
was
written
off
in
evident
haste
and
ran
as
follows
let
me
see
you
once
more
on
the
subject
you
know
of
why
will
you
not
accept
the
honorable
position
offered
to
you
there
shall
be
no
stint
of
money
all
the
promises
i
have
made
i
am
quite
ready
to
fulfill
you
shall
lose
nothing
by
being
gentle
surely
you
can
not
continue
to
seem
so
destitute
of
all
womanly
feeling
and
pity
i
will
not
believe
that
you
would
so
deliberately
condemn
to
death
a
man
who
has
loved
and
who
loves
you
still
so
faithfully
and
who
without
you
is
utterly
weary
of
life
and
think
once
more
and
let
my
words
carry
more
weight
with
you
this
was
all
but
more
than
enough
i
wonder
what
he
means
thought
lady
winsleigh
it
looks
as
if
he
were
in
love
with
the
vere
and
she
refused
to
reciprocate
it
be
that
and
yet
that
does
accord
with
what
the
creature
herself
said
about
his
at
her
he
would
do
that
if
he
were
in
love
she
studied
every
word
of
the
letter
again
and
again
and
finally
folded
it
up
carefully
and
placed
it
in
her
innocent
or
guilty
thelma
must
see
it
she
decided
i
wonder
how
she
take
it
if
she
wants
a
proof
it
one
she
scarcely
deny
some
women
would
fret
themselves
to
death
over
it
but
i
wonder
if
she
sat
down
under
it
quite
calmly
without
a
word
of
complaint
she
frowned
a
little
why
must
always
be
superior
to
others
of
her
sex
how
i
detest
that
still
solemn
smile
of
hers
and
those
big
eyes
i
think
if
philip
had
married
any
other
woman
than
she
a
woman
more
like
the
rest
of
us
who
have
gone
with
her
time
i
could
have
forgiven
him
more
easily
but
to
pick
up
a
norwegian
peasant
and
set
her
up
as
a
sort
of
moral
to
society
and
then
to
go
and
compromise
himself
with
violet
vere
that
a
kind
of
thing
i
stand
i
rather
be
anything
in
the
world
than
a
humbug
many
people
desire
to
be
something
they
are
not
and
her
ladyship
quite
unconsciously
echoed
this
rather
general
sentiment
she
was
without
knowing
it
such
an
adept
in
society
humbug
that
she
even
humbugged
herself
she
betrayed
herself
as
she
betrayed
others
and
told
little
soothing
lies
to
her
own
conscience
as
she
told
them
to
her
friends
there
are
plenty
of
women
like
her
women
of
pleasant
courtesy
and
fashion
to
whom
truth
is
mere
coarseness
and
with
whom
polite
lying
passes
for
perfect
breeding
she
was
not
aware
as
she
was
driven
along
park
lane
to
her
own
residence
that
she
carried
with
her
on
the
box
of
her
brougham
a
private
detective
in
the
person
of
briggs
perched
stiffly
on
his
seat
with
arms
tightly
folded
this
respectable
retainer
was
quite
absorbed
in
meditation
so
much
so
that
he
exchanged
not
a
word
with
his
friend
the
coachman
beside
him
he
had
his
own
notions
of
propriety
he
considered
that
his
mistress
had
no
business
whatever
to
call
on
an
actress
of
violet
vere
repute
and
he
resolved
that
whether
he
were
reproved
for
or
not
nothing
should
prevent
him
from
casually
mentioning
to
lord
winsleigh
the
object
of
her
ladyship
drive
that
morning
for
mused
briggs
gravely
a
lady
responsibilities
and
she
forgets
appearances
to
be
kep
up
with
the
afternoon
the
fog
which
had
hung
over
the
city
all
day
deepened
and
darkened
thelma
had
lunched
with
lorimer
and
had
enjoyed
much
pleasant
chat
with
that
kindly
cheerful
old
lady
she
had
confided
to
her
part
of
the
story
of
sir
francis
lennox
conduct
carefully
avoiding
every
mention
of
the
circumstance
which
had
given
rise
to
it
namely
the
discussion
about
violet
vere
she
merely
explained
that
she
had
suddenly
fainted
in
which
condition
sir
francis
had
taken
advantage
of
her
helplessness
to
insult
her
lorimer
was
highly
indignant
tell
your
husband
all
about
it
my
dear
she
advised
he
big
enough
and
strong
enough
to
give
that
little
snob
a
good
trouncing
my
patience
i
wish
george
were
in
london
he
lend
a
hand
and
welcome
and
the
old
lady
nodded
her
head
violently
over
the
sock
she
was
knitting
the
making
of
socks
for
her
beloved
son
was
her
principal
occupation
and
amusement
but
i
hear
said
thelma
that
it
is
against
the
law
to
strike
any
one
no
matter
how
you
have
been
insulted
if
so
then
philip
would
be
punished
for
attacking
sir
francis
and
that
would
not
be
fair
you
did
think
of
that
child
when
you
struck
lennox
yourself
returned
lorimer
laughing
and
i
guarantee
you
gave
him
a
good
hard
blow
and
serve
him
right
never
mind
what
comes
of
it
my
dearie
just
tell
your
husband
as
soon
as
ever
he
comes
home
and
let
him
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
he
a
fine
man
he
know
how
to
defend
the
pretty
wife
he
loves
so
well
and
she
smiled
while
her
shining
clicked
faster
than
ever
thelma
face
saddened
a
little
i
think
i
am
not
worthy
of
his
love
she
said
sorrowfully
lorimer
looked
at
her
with
some
inquisitiveness
what
makes
you
say
that
my
dear
because
i
feel
it
so
much
she
replied
dear
lorimer
you
can
not
perhaps
understand
but
when
he
married
me
it
seemed
as
if
the
old
story
of
the
king
and
the
were
being
repeated
over
again
i
sought
nothing
but
his
love
his
love
was
and
is
my
life
these
riches
these
jewels
and
beautiful
things
he
surrounds
me
with
i
do
not
care
for
them
at
all
except
for
the
reason
that
he
wishes
me
to
have
them
i
scarcely
understand
their
value
for
i
have
been
poor
all
my
life
and
yet
i
have
wanted
nothing
i
do
not
think
wealth
is
needful
to
make
one
happy
but
love
ah
i
could
not
live
without
it
and
now
now
she
paused
and
her
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
now
what
asked
lorimer
gently
now
continued
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
my
heart
is
always
afraid
yes
i
am
afraid
of
losing
my
husband
love
ah
do
not
laugh
at
me
dear
lorimer
you
know
people
who
are
much
together
sometimes
get
tired
tired
of
seeing
the
same
face
always
the
same
form
are
tired
dearie
asked
the
old
lady
meaningly
i
tired
of
philip
i
am
only
happy
when
he
is
with
me
and
her
eyes
deepened
with
passionate
tenderness
i
would
wish
to
live
and
die
beside
him
and
i
should
not
care
if
i
never
saw
another
human
face
than
his
well
and
do
you
think
he
has
the
same
feelings
for
you
men
are
different
i
think
returned
thelma
musingly
now
love
is
everything
to
me
but
it
may
not
be
everything
to
philip
i
do
believe
that
love
is
only
part
of
a
man
life
while
it
is
a
woman
clara
told
me
once
that
most
husbands
wearied
of
their
wives
though
they
would
not
always
confess
it
clara
winsleigh
modern
social
doctrines
are
false
my
dear
interrupted
lorimer
quickly
she
is
satisfied
with
her
own
marriage
and
she
thinks
everybody
must
be
as
discontented
as
herself
now
my
husband
and
i
lived
always
together
for
five
and
twenty
years
and
we
were
lovers
to
the
last
day
when
my
darling
died
with
his
hand
in
mine
and
and
if
it
had
been
for
my
boy
i
should
have
died
too
and
two
bright
tears
fell
glittering
on
the
old
lady
knitting
thelma
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
fondly
i
can
understand
that
she
said
softly
but
still
still
i
do
believe
it
is
difficult
to
keep
love
when
you
have
won
it
it
is
perhaps
easy
to
win
but
i
am
sure
it
is
hard
to
keep
lorimer
looked
at
her
earnestly
my
dear
child
do
let
that
frivolous
winsleigh
woman
put
nonsense
into
your
pretty
head
you
are
too
sensible
to
take
such
a
morbid
view
of
things
and
you
must
allow
your
wholesome
fresh
nature
to
be
contaminated
by
the
petulant
notions
that
cloud
the
brains
of
idle
fashionable
useless
women
believe
me
good
men
do
tire
of
their
wives
and
sir
philip
is
a
good
man
good
wives
never
weary
their
husbands
and
you
are
a
good
wife
and
you
will
be
a
good
sweet
mother
think
of
that
new
delight
so
soon
coming
for
you
and
leave
all
the
modern
crazy
notions
of
human
life
to
the
french
and
russian
novelists
continued
the
old
lady
tenderly
a
nice
little
ladyship
you
are
worrying
yourself
about
nothing
send
philip
to
me
when
he
comes
home
i
scold
him
for
leaving
his
bird
to
mope
in
her
london
cage
i
do
not
mope
declared
thelma
and
you
must
not
scold
him
please
poor
boy
he
is
working
so
very
hard
and
has
so
much
to
attend
to
he
wants
to
distinguish
himself
for
for
my
sake
that
looks
very
much
as
if
he
were
tired
of
you
laughed
lorimer
though
i
dare
say
you
like
him
to
stay
at
home
and
make
love
to
you
all
day
silly
girl
you
want
the
world
to
be
a
sort
of
arcadia
with
you
as
phyllis
and
sir
philip
as
corydon
my
dear
we
living
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
days
of
fond
shepherds
and
languishing
shepherdesses
are
past
thelma
laughed
too
and
felt
soon
ashamed
of
her
depression
the
figure
of
violet
vere
now
and
then
danced
before
her
like
a
mocking
but
her
pride
forbade
her
to
mention
this
the
actual
source
of
all
her
vague
troubles
she
left
lorimer
house
which
was
near
holland
park
about
four
and
as
she
was
passing
church
street
kensington
she
bade
her
coachman
drive
up
to
the
carmelite
church
there
familiarly
known
as
the
carms
she
entered
the
sacred
edifice
where
the
service
of
benediction
was
in
progress
and
kneeling
down
she
listened
to
the
exquisite
strains
of
the
solemn
music
that
pealed
through
those
dim
and
shadowy
aisles
and
a
sense
of
the
most
perfect
peace
settled
soothingly
on
her
soul
clasping
her
gentle
hands
she
prayed
with
innocent
and
earnestness
not
for
herself
never
for
herself
but
always
always
for
that
dear
most
dear
one
for
whom
every
beat
of
her
true
heart
was
a
fresh
vow
of
undying
and
devoted
affection
dear
god
she
whispered
if
i
love
him
too
much
forgive
me
thou
who
art
all
love
wilt
pardon
me
this
excess
of
love
bless
my
darling
always
and
teach
me
how
to
be
more
worthy
of
thy
goodness
and
his
tenderness
and
when
she
left
the
church
she
was
happier
and
more
than
she
had
been
for
many
a
long
day
she
drove
home
heedless
of
the
fog
and
cold
dismal
aspect
of
the
weather
and
resolved
to
go
and
visit
lady
winsleigh
in
the
evening
so
that
when
philip
came
back
on
the
morrow
she
might
be
able
to
tell
him
that
she
had
amused
herself
and
had
not
been
lonely
but
when
she
arrived
at
her
own
door
morris
who
opened
it
informed
her
that
lady
winsleigh
was
waiting
in
the
to
see
her
and
had
been
waiting
some
time
thelma
hastened
thither
immediately
and
held
out
her
hands
joyously
to
her
friend
i
am
so
sorry
you
have
had
to
wait
clara
she
began
why
did
you
not
send
word
and
say
you
were
coming
philip
is
away
and
will
not
be
back
and
i
have
been
lunching
with
lorimer
and
why
what
makes
you
look
so
grave
lady
winsleigh
regarded
her
fixedly
how
radiantly
lovely
the
young
wife
looked
her
cheeks
had
never
been
more
delicately
rosy
or
her
eyes
more
brilliant
the
dark
fur
cloak
she
wore
with
its
rich
sable
trimmings
and
the
little
black
velvet
that
rested
on
her
fair
curls
set
off
the
beauty
of
her
clear
skin
to
perfection
and
her
rival
who
stood
gazing
at
her
with
such
close
scrutiny
envied
her
more
than
ever
as
she
was
once
again
reluctantly
forced
to
admit
to
herself
the
matchless
loveliness
of
the
innocent
creature
whose
happiness
she
now
sought
to
destroy
do
i
look
grave
thelma
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
well
perhaps
i
a
reason
for
my
gravity
and
so
your
husband
is
away
yes
he
went
quite
early
this
morning
a
telegram
summoned
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
go
here
she
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
began
to
loosen
her
wraps
sit
down
clara
i
will
ring
for
tea
no
do
ring
said
lady
winsleigh
not
yet
i
want
to
talk
to
you
privately
she
sank
languidly
on
a
velvet
lounge
and
looked
thelma
straight
in
the
eyes
dear
thelma
she
continued
in
a
sweetly
tremulous
compassionate
voice
can
you
bear
to
hear
something
very
painful
and
shocking
something
that
i
afraid
will
grieve
you
very
much
the
color
fled
from
the
girl
fair
face
her
eyes
grew
startled
what
do
you
mean
clara
is
it
anything
about
about
philip
lady
winsleigh
bent
her
head
in
assent
but
remained
silent
if
continued
thelma
with
a
little
return
of
the
rosy
hue
to
her
cheeks
if
it
is
something
else
about
that
that
person
at
the
theatre
clara
i
would
rather
not
hear
it
i
think
i
have
been
wrong
in
listening
to
any
such
stories
it
is
so
seldom
that
gossip
of
any
kind
is
true
it
is
not
a
wife
duty
to
receive
scandals
about
her
husband
and
suppose
he
does
see
miss
vere
how
do
i
know
that
it
may
not
be
on
business
for
some
friend
of
his
because
i
do
know
that
on
that
night
when
he
went
behind
the
scenes
at
the
brilliant
he
said
it
was
on
business
lovelace
used
often
to
go
and
see
miss
mary
anderson
all
to
persuade
her
to
take
a
play
written
by
a
friend
of
his
and
philip
who
is
always
may
perhaps
be
doing
something
of
the
same
sort
i
feel
i
have
been
wicked
to
have
even
a
small
doubt
of
my
husband
love
so
clara
do
not
let
us
talk
any
more
on
a
subject
which
only
displeases
me
you
must
choose
your
own
way
of
life
of
course
said
lady
winsleigh
coldly
but
you
draw
rather
foolish
comparisons
thelma
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
mary
anderson
and
violet
vere
besides
lovelace
is
a
bachelor
he
can
do
as
he
likes
and
go
where
he
likes
without
exciting
comment
however
whether
you
are
angry
with
me
or
not
i
feel
i
should
not
be
your
true
friend
if
i
did
not
show
you
you
know
your
husband
writing
and
she
drew
out
the
fatal
letter
and
continued
watching
her
victim
as
she
spoke
this
was
sent
by
sir
philip
to
violet
vere
last
night
she
gave
it
to
me
herself
this
morning
thelma
hand
trembled
as
she
took
the
paper
why
should
i
read
it
she
faltered
mechanically
lady
winsleigh
raised
her
eyebrows
and
frowned
impatiently
why
why
because
it
is
your
duty
to
do
so
have
you
no
pride
will
you
allow
your
husband
to
write
such
a
letter
as
that
to
another
woman
and
a
woman
too
without
one
word
of
remonstrance
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
your
own
sense
of
honor
to
resent
and
resist
such
treatment
on
his
part
surely
the
deepest
love
can
not
pardon
deliberate
injury
and
insult
my
love
can
pardon
anything
answered
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
and
then
slowly
very
slowly
she
opened
the
folded
sheet
slowly
she
read
every
word
it
contained
words
that
stamped
themselves
one
by
one
on
her
bewildered
brain
and
sent
it
reeling
into
darkness
and
vacancy
she
felt
sick
and
cold
she
stared
fixedly
at
her
husband
familiar
handwriting
a
man
who
has
loved
and
who
loves
you
still
and
who
without
you
is
utterly
weary
and
thus
he
wrote
of
himself
to
to
violet
vere
it
seemed
incredible
yet
it
was
true
she
heard
a
rushing
sound
in
her
ears
the
room
swung
round
dizzily
before
her
eyes
yet
she
sat
still
calm
and
cold
holding
the
letter
and
speaking
no
word
lady
winsleigh
watched
her
irritated
at
her
passionless
demeanor
well
she
exclaimed
at
last
have
you
nothing
to
say
thelma
looked
up
her
eyes
burning
with
an
intense
feverish
light
nothing
she
replied
repeated
her
ladyship
with
emphatic
astonishment
nothing
against
philip
continued
the
girl
steadily
for
the
blame
is
not
his
but
mine
that
he
is
weary
and
must
be
my
fault
though
i
can
not
yet
understand
what
i
have
done
but
it
must
be
something
because
if
i
were
all
that
he
wished
he
would
not
have
grown
so
tired
she
paused
and
her
pale
lips
quivered
i
am
sorry
she
went
on
with
dreamy
pathos
sorrier
for
him
than
for
myself
because
now
i
see
i
am
in
the
way
of
his
happiness
a
quiver
of
agony
passed
over
her
face
she
fixed
her
large
bright
eyes
on
lady
winsleigh
who
instinctively
shrank
from
the
solemn
speechless
despair
of
that
penetrating
gaze
who
gave
you
this
letter
clara
she
asked
calmly
i
told
you
before
miss
vere
herself
why
did
she
give
it
to
you
continued
thelma
in
a
dull
sad
voice
lady
winsleigh
hesitated
and
stammered
a
little
well
because
because
i
asked
her
if
the
stories
about
sir
philip
were
true
and
she
begged
me
to
ask
him
not
to
visit
her
so
often
then
with
an
additional
thought
of
malice
she
said
softly
she
does
wish
to
wrong
you
thelma
of
course
she
not
a
very
good
woman
but
i
think
she
feels
sorry
for
you
the
girl
uttered
a
smothered
cry
of
anguish
as
though
she
had
been
stabbed
to
the
heart
she
to
be
actually
by
violet
vere
because
she
had
been
unable
to
keep
her
husband
love
this
idea
tortured
her
very
soul
but
she
was
silent
i
thought
you
were
my
friend
clara
she
said
suddenly
with
a
strange
wistfulness
so
i
am
thelma
murmured
lady
winsleigh
a
guilty
flush
coloring
her
cheeks
you
have
made
me
very
miserable
went
on
thelma
gravely
and
with
pathetic
simplicity
and
i
am
sorry
indeed
that
we
ever
met
i
was
so
happy
till
i
knew
you
and
yet
i
was
very
fond
of
you
i
am
sure
you
mean
everything
for
the
best
but
i
can
not
think
it
is
so
and
it
is
all
so
dark
and
desolate
now
why
have
you
taken
such
pains
to
make
me
sad
why
have
you
so
often
tried
to
make
me
doubt
my
husband
love
why
have
you
come
so
quickly
to
tell
me
i
have
lost
it
but
for
you
i
might
never
have
known
this
sorrow
i
might
have
died
soon
in
happy
ignorance
believing
in
my
darling
truth
as
i
believe
in
god
her
voice
broke
and
a
hard
sob
choked
her
utterance
for
once
lady
winsleigh
conscience
smote
her
for
once
she
felt
ashamed
and
dared
not
offer
consolation
to
the
innocent
soul
she
had
so
wantonly
stricken
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
silence
broken
only
by
the
monotonous
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
crackling
of
the
fire
presently
thelma
spoke
again
i
will
ask
you
to
go
away
now
and
leave
me
clara
she
said
simply
when
the
heart
is
sorrowful
it
is
best
to
be
alone
and
she
gently
held
out
her
hand
poor
thelma
said
lady
winsleigh
taking
it
with
an
affectation
of
tenderness
what
will
you
do
thelma
did
not
answer
she
sat
mute
and
rigid
you
are
thinking
unkindly
of
me
just
now
continued
clara
softly
but
i
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
you
the
worst
at
once
it
no
good
living
in
a
delusion
i
very
very
sorry
for
you
thelma
thelma
remained
perfectly
silent
lady
winsleigh
moved
towards
the
door
and
as
she
opened
it
looked
back
at
her
the
girl
might
have
been
a
lifeless
figure
for
any
movement
that
could
be
perceived
about
her
her
face
was
white
as
marble
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
sparkling
fire
her
very
hands
looked
stiff
and
pallid
as
wax
as
they
lay
clasped
in
her
lap
the
letter
the
cruel
letter
had
fallen
at
her
feet
she
seemed
as
one
in
a
trance
of
misery
and
so
lady
winsleigh
left
her
chapter
xxvi
o
my
lord
o
love
i
have
laid
my
life
at
thy
feet
have
thy
will
thereof
for
what
shall
please
thee
is
sweet
swinburne
she
roused
herself
at
last
unclasping
her
hands
she
pushed
back
her
hair
from
her
brows
and
sighed
heavily
shivering
as
with
intense
cold
she
rose
from
the
chair
she
had
so
long
occupied
and
stood
upright
mechanically
gathering
around
her
the
long
fur
mantle
that
she
had
not
as
yet
taken
off
catching
sight
of
the
letter
where
it
lay
a
gleaming
speck
of
white
on
the
rich
dark
hues
of
the
carpet
she
picked
it
up
and
read
it
through
again
calmly
and
comprehensively
then
folded
it
up
carefully
as
though
it
were
something
of
inestimable
value
her
thoughts
were
a
little
confused
she
could
only
realize
clearly
two
distinct
things
first
that
philip
was
unhappy
secondly
that
she
was
in
the
way
of
his
happiness
she
did
not
pause
to
consider
how
this
change
in
him
had
been
effected
moreover
she
never
imagined
that
the
letter
he
had
written
could
refer
to
any
one
but
himself
hers
was
a
nature
that
accepted
facts
as
they
appeared
she
never
sought
for
ulterior
motives
or
disguised
meanings
true
she
could
not
understand
her
admiration
for
violet
vere
but
then
she
thought
many
other
men
admire
her
too
and
so
it
is
certain
there
must
be
something
about
her
that
wins
love
something
i
can
not
see
and
presently
she
put
aside
all
other
considerations
and
only
pondered
on
one
thing
how
should
she
remove
herself
from
the
path
of
her
husband
pleasure
for
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
she
was
an
obstacle
to
his
enjoyment
he
had
made
promises
to
violet
vere
which
he
was
ready
to
fulfill
he
offered
her
an
honorable
position
he
desired
her
not
to
condemn
him
to
death
he
besought
her
to
let
his
words
carry
more
weight
with
her
it
is
because
i
am
here
thought
thelma
wearily
she
would
listen
to
him
if
i
were
gone
she
had
the
strangest
notions
of
wifely
duty
odd
minglings
of
the
stern
norse
customs
with
the
gentler
teachings
of
christianity
yet
in
both
cases
the
lines
of
woman
life
were
clearly
defined
in
one
word
obedience
most
women
receiving
an
apparent
proof
of
a
husband
infidelity
would
have
made
what
is
termed
a
scene
would
have
confronted
him
with
rage
and
tears
and
personal
abuse
but
thelma
was
too
gentle
for
this
too
gentle
to
resist
what
seemed
to
be
philip
wish
and
will
and
far
too
proud
to
stay
where
it
appeared
evident
she
was
not
wanted
moreover
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
speaking
to
him
on
such
a
subject
as
his
connection
with
violet
vere
the
hot
color
flushed
her
cheeks
with
a
sort
of
shame
as
she
thought
of
it
of
course
she
was
weak
of
course
she
was
foolish
we
will
grant
that
she
was
anything
the
reader
chooses
to
call
her
it
is
much
better
for
a
woman
nowadays
to
be
defiant
rather
than
yielding
aggressive
not
submissive
violent
not
meek
we
all
know
that
to
abuse
a
husband
well
all
round
is
the
modern
method
of
managing
him
but
poor
foolish
loving
sensitive
thelma
had
nothing
of
the
magnificent
strength
of
mind
possessed
by
most
wives
of
she
could
only
realize
that
philip
her
philip
was
utterly
weary
and
for
the
sake
of
another
woman
and
that
other
woman
actually
pitied
she
pitied
herself
too
a
little
vaguely
her
brows
ached
and
throbbed
violently
there
was
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
but
she
could
not
weep
tears
would
have
relieved
her
tired
brain
but
no
tears
fell
she
strove
to
decide
on
some
immediate
plan
of
action
philip
would
be
home
she
recoiled
at
the
thought
of
meeting
him
knowing
what
she
knew
glancing
dreamily
at
her
own
figure
reflected
by
the
lamplight
in
the
long
mirror
opposite
she
recognized
that
she
was
fully
attired
in
outdoor
costume
all
save
her
hat
which
she
had
taken
off
after
her
first
greeting
of
lady
winsleigh
and
which
was
still
on
the
table
at
her
side
she
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
five
minutes
to
seven
eight
was
her
and
thinking
of
this
she
suddenly
rang
the
bell
morris
immediately
answered
it
i
shall
not
dine
at
home
she
said
in
her
usual
gentle
voice
i
am
going
to
see
some
friend
this
evening
i
may
not
be
back
till
till
late
very
well
my
lady
and
morris
retired
without
seeing
anything
remarkable
in
his
mistress
announcement
thelma
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
he
disappeared
and
steadying
her
nerves
by
a
strong
effort
passed
into
her
own
boudoir
the
little
sanctum
specially
endeared
to
her
by
philip
frequent
presence
there
how
cosy
and
comfortable
a
it
looked
a
small
fire
glowed
warmly
in
the
grate
and
britta
whose
duty
it
was
to
keep
this
particular
room
in
order
had
lit
the
lamp
a
rosy
globe
supported
by
a
laughing
cupid
and
had
drawn
the
velvet
curtains
close
at
the
window
to
keep
out
the
fog
and
chilly
air
there
were
fragrant
flowers
on
the
table
thelma
own
favorite
lounge
was
drawn
up
to
the
fender
in
readiness
for
her
opposite
to
it
stood
the
deep
easy
chair
in
which
philip
always
sat
she
looked
round
upon
all
these
familiar
things
with
a
dreary
sense
of
strangeness
and
desolation
and
the
curves
of
her
sweet
mouth
trembled
a
little
and
drooped
piteously
but
her
resolve
was
taken
and
she
did
not
hesitate
or
weep
she
sat
down
to
her
desk
and
wrote
a
few
brief
lines
to
her
father
this
letter
she
addressed
and
stamped
ready
for
posting
then
for
a
while
she
remained
apparently
lost
in
painful
musings
playing
with
the
pen
she
held
and
uncertain
what
to
do
presently
she
drew
a
sheet
of
toward
her
and
began
my
darling
boy
as
these
words
appeared
under
her
hand
on
the
white
page
her
forced
calm
nearly
gave
way
a
low
cry
of
intense
agony
escaped
from
her
lips
and
dropping
the
pen
she
rose
and
paced
the
room
restlessly
one
hand
pressed
against
her
heart
as
though
that
action
could
still
its
rapid
beatings
once
more
she
essayed
the
hard
task
she
had
set
herself
to
fulfill
the
task
of
bidding
farewell
to
the
husband
in
whom
her
life
was
centred
piteous
passionate
words
came
quickly
from
her
overcharged
and
almost
breaking
heart
words
tender
touching
full
of
love
and
absolutely
free
from
all
reproach
little
did
she
guess
as
she
wrote
that
parting
letter
what
desperate
misery
it
would
cause
to
the
receiver
when
she
had
finished
it
she
felt
quieted
even
more
composed
than
before
she
folded
and
sealed
it
then
put
it
out
of
sight
and
rang
for
britta
that
little
maiden
soon
appeared
and
seemed
surprised
to
see
her
mistress
still
in
walking
costume
have
you
only
just
come
in
fröken
she
ventured
to
inquire
no
i
came
home
some
time
ago
returned
thelma
gently
but
i
was
talking
to
lady
winsleigh
in
the
and
as
i
am
going
out
again
this
evening
i
shall
not
require
to
change
my
dress
i
want
you
to
post
this
letter
for
me
britta
and
she
held
out
the
one
addressed
to
her
father
olaf
güldmar
britta
took
it
but
her
mind
still
revolved
the
question
of
her
attire
if
you
are
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
friends
she
suggested
would
it
not
be
better
to
change
i
have
on
a
velvet
gown
said
thelma
with
a
rather
wearied
patience
it
is
quite
dressy
enough
for
where
i
am
going
she
paused
abruptly
and
britta
looked
at
her
inquiringly
are
you
tired
fröken
thelma
she
asked
you
are
so
pale
i
have
a
slight
headache
thelma
answered
it
is
nothing
it
will
soon
pass
i
wish
you
to
post
that
letter
at
once
britta
very
well
fröken
britta
still
hesitated
will
you
be
out
all
the
evening
was
her
next
query
yes
then
perhaps
you
will
not
mind
if
i
go
and
see
louise
and
take
supper
with
her
she
has
asked
me
and
briggs
here
britta
laughed
is
coming
to
see
if
i
can
go
he
will
escort
me
he
says
and
she
laughed
again
thelma
forced
herself
to
smile
you
can
go
by
all
means
britta
but
i
thought
you
did
not
like
lady
winsleigh
french
maid
i
do
like
her
much
britta
admitted
still
she
means
to
be
kind
and
agreeable
i
think
and
here
she
eyed
thelma
with
a
mysterious
and
important
air
i
want
to
ask
her
a
question
about
something
very
particular
then
go
and
stay
as
long
as
you
like
dear
said
thelma
a
sudden
impulse
of
affection
causing
her
to
caress
softly
her
little
ruffled
brown
curls
i
shall
not
be
back
till
till
quite
late
and
when
you
return
from
the
post
i
shall
be
gone
so
exclaimed
britta
wonderingly
why
where
are
you
going
one
would
think
you
were
starting
on
a
long
journey
you
speak
so
strangely
fröken
do
i
and
thelma
smiled
kindly
it
is
because
my
head
aches
i
suppose
but
it
is
not
strange
to
say
britta
britta
caught
her
hand
where
are
you
going
she
persisted
to
see
some
friends
responded
thelma
quietly
now
do
not
ask
any
more
questions
britta
but
go
and
post
my
letter
i
want
father
to
get
it
as
soon
as
possible
and
you
will
lose
the
post
if
you
are
not
very
quick
thus
reminded
britta
hastened
off
determining
to
run
all
the
way
in
order
to
get
back
before
her
mistress
left
the
house
thelma
however
was
too
quick
for
her
as
soon
as
britta
had
gone
she
took
the
letter
she
had
written
to
philip
and
slipped
it
within
the
pages
of
a
small
volume
of
poems
he
had
lately
been
reading
it
was
a
new
book
entitled
gladys
the
singer
and
its
leading
was
the
old
subject
of
a
woman
too
faithful
love
betrayal
and
despair
as
she
opened
it
her
eyes
fell
by
chance
on
a
few
lines
of
hopeless
yet
musical
melancholy
which
like
a
sad
song
heard
suddenly
made
her
throat
swell
with
rising
yet
restrained
tears
they
ran
thus
oh
i
can
drown
or
like
a
broken
lyre
be
thrown
to
earth
or
cast
upon
a
fire
i
can
be
made
to
feel
the
pangs
of
death
and
yet
be
constant
to
the
quest
of
breath
our
poor
pale
trick
of
living
through
the
lies
we
name
existence
when
that
dies
which
we
call
honor
many
and
many
a
way
can
i
be
struck
or
fretted
night
or
day
in
some
new
fashion
or
condemn
the
while
to
take
for
food
the
semblance
of
a
smile
the
rapture
of
a
slain
caress
ah
she
caught
her
breath
sobbingly
the
rapture
of
a
slain
caress
yes
that
would
be
her
portion
now
if
if
she
stayed
to
receive
it
but
she
would
not
stay
she
turned
over
the
volume
abstractedly
scarcely
conscious
of
the
action
and
suddenly
as
if
the
of
it
had
been
present
to
probe
her
soul
and
make
her
inmost
thoughts
public
she
read
because
i
am
unlov
of
thee
and
undesired
as
in
the
sea
yes
that
was
the
because
of
everything
that
swayed
her
sorrowful
spirit
because
she
was
unlov
and
undesired
she
hesitated
no
longer
but
shut
the
book
with
her
farewell
letter
inside
it
and
put
it
back
in
its
former
place
on
the
little
table
beside
philip
then
she
considered
how
she
should
distinguish
it
by
some
mark
that
should
attract
her
husband
attention
toward
it
and
loosening
from
her
neck
a
thin
gold
chain
on
which
was
suspended
a
small
diamond
cross
with
the
names
philip
and
thelma
engraved
at
the
back
she
twisted
it
round
the
little
book
and
left
it
so
that
the
sparkle
of
the
jewels
should
be
seen
distinctly
on
the
cover
now
was
there
anything
more
to
be
done
she
divested
herself
of
all
her
valuable
ornaments
keeping
only
her
and
its
companion
circlet
of
brilliants
she
emptied
her
purse
of
all
money
save
that
which
was
absolutely
necessary
for
her
journey
then
she
put
on
her
hat
and
began
to
fasten
her
long
cloak
slowly
for
her
fingers
were
icy
cold
and
trembled
very
strangely
stay
there
was
her
husband
portrait
she
might
take
that
she
thought
with
a
sort
of
touching
timidity
it
was
a
miniature
on
ivory
and
had
been
painted
expressly
for
her
she
placed
it
inside
her
dress
against
her
bosom
he
has
been
too
good
to
me
she
murmured
and
i
have
been
too
happy
happier
than
i
deserved
to
be
excess
of
happiness
must
always
end
in
sorrow
she
looked
dreamily
at
philip
empty
chair
in
fancy
she
could
see
his
familiar
figure
seated
there
and
she
sighed
as
she
thought
of
the
face
she
loved
so
well
the
passion
of
his
eyes
the
tenderness
of
his
smile
softly
she
kissed
the
place
where
his
head
had
rested
then
turned
resolutely
away
she
was
giving
up
everything
she
thought
to
another
woman
but
then
that
other
woman
however
incredible
it
seemed
was
the
one
philip
loved
best
his
own
written
words
were
a
proof
of
this
there
was
no
choice
therefore
his
pleasure
was
her
first
consideration
everything
must
yield
to
that
so
she
imagined
her
own
life
was
nothing
in
her
estimation
compared
to
his
desire
such
devotion
as
hers
was
of
course
absurd
it
amounted
to
weak
and
would
certainly
be
accounted
as
supremely
foolish
by
most
women
who
have
husbands
and
who
when
they
swear
to
obey
mean
to
break
the
vow
at
every
convenient
opportunity
but
thelma
could
not
alter
her
strange
nature
and
with
her
obedience
meant
the
extreme
letter
of
the
law
of
utter
submission
leaving
the
room
she
had
so
lately
called
her
own
she
passed
into
the
morris
was
not
there
and
she
did
not
summon
him
she
opened
the
for
herself
and
shutting
it
quietly
behind
her
she
stood
alone
in
the
cold
street
where
the
fog
had
now
grown
so
dense
that
the
were
scarcely
visible
she
walked
on
for
a
few
paces
rather
bewildered
and
chilled
by
the
piercing
bitterness
of
the
air
then
rallying
her
forces
she
hailed
a
passing
cab
and
told
the
man
to
take
her
to
charing
cross
station
she
was
not
familiar
with
london
and
charing
cross
was
the
only
great
railway
terminus
she
could
just
then
think
of
arrived
there
the
glare
of
the
electric
light
the
jostling
passengers
rushing
to
and
from
the
trains
the
shouts
and
wrangling
of
porters
and
cabmen
confused
her
not
a
little
and
the
bold
looks
of
admiration
bestowed
on
her
freely
by
the
male
loungers
sauntering
near
the
doors
of
the
restaurant
and
hotel
made
her
shrink
and
tremble
for
shame
she
had
never
travelled
entirely
alone
before
and
she
began
to
be
frightened
at
the
pandemonium
of
sights
and
noises
that
surged
around
her
yet
she
never
once
thought
of
returning
she
never
dreamed
of
going
to
any
of
her
london
friends
lest
on
hearing
of
her
trouble
they
might
reproach
philip
and
this
thelma
would
not
have
endured
for
the
same
reason
she
had
said
nothing
to
britta
in
her
then
condition
it
seemed
to
her
that
only
one
course
lay
open
for
her
to
follow
and
that
was
to
go
quietly
home
home
to
the
altenfjord
no
one
would
be
to
blame
for
her
departure
but
herself
she
thought
and
philip
would
be
free
thus
she
reasoned
if
indeed
she
reasoned
at
all
but
there
was
such
a
frozen
stillness
in
her
soul
her
senses
were
so
numbed
with
pain
that
as
yet
she
scarcely
realized
either
what
had
happened
or
what
she
herself
was
doing
she
was
as
one
walking
in
sleep
the
awakening
bitter
as
death
was
still
to
come
presently
a
great
rush
of
people
began
to
stream
towards
her
from
one
of
the
platforms
and
trucks
of
luggage
heralded
by
shouts
of
out
of
the
way
there
and
leave
came
trundling
rapidly
along
the
tidal
train
from
the
continent
had
just
arrived
dismayed
at
the
increasing
confusion
and
uproar
thelma
addressed
herself
to
an
official
with
a
gold
band
round
his
hat
can
you
tell
me
she
asked
timidly
where
i
shall
take
a
ticket
for
hull
the
man
glanced
at
the
fair
anxious
face
and
smiled
you
come
to
the
wrong
station
miss
he
said
you
want
the
midland
line
the
midland
thelma
felt
more
bewildered
than
ever
yes
the
he
repeated
rather
testily
it
a
good
way
from
here
you
better
take
a
cab
she
moved
away
but
started
and
drew
herself
back
into
a
shadowed
corner
coloring
deeply
as
the
sound
of
a
rich
mellifluous
voice
which
she
instantly
recognized
smote
suddenly
on
her
ears
and
as
i
before
remarked
my
good
fellow
the
voice
was
saying
i
am
not
a
disciple
of
the
if
a
man
has
a
thought
which
is
worth
declaring
let
him
declare
it
with
a
free
and
noble
utterance
do
let
him
wrap
it
up
in
multifarious
parcels
of
dreary
verbosity
there
too
much
of
that
kind
of
thing
going
on
nowadays
in
england
at
least
there
a
kind
of
imitation
of
art
which
is
art
at
all
a
morbid
bilious
bad
imitation
you
only
get
close
to
the
real
goddess
in
italy
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
come
and
pass
the
winter
with
me
there
it
was
beau
lovelace
who
spoke
and
he
was
talking
to
george
lorimer
the
two
had
met
in
paris
lovelace
was
on
his
way
to
london
where
a
matter
of
business
summoned
him
for
a
few
days
and
lorimer
somewhat
tired
of
the
french
capital
decided
to
return
with
him
and
here
they
were
just
arrived
at
charing
cross
and
they
walked
across
the
station
arm
in
arm
little
imagining
who
watched
them
from
behind
the
shelter
of
one
of
the
doors
with
a
yearning
sorrow
in
her
grave
blue
eyes
they
stopped
almost
opposite
to
her
to
light
their
cigars
she
saw
lorimer
face
quite
distinctly
and
heard
his
answer
to
lovelace
well
i
see
what
i
can
do
about
it
beau
you
know
my
mother
always
likes
to
get
away
from
london
in
winter
but
whether
we
ought
to
inflict
ourselves
upon
you
you
being
a
literary
man
too
nonsense
you
wo
interfere
in
the
least
with
the
flow
of
inky
inspiration
laughed
beau
and
as
for
your
mother
i
in
love
with
her
as
you
are
aware
i
admire
her
almost
as
much
as
i
do
lady
and
that
saying
a
great
deal
if
phil
can
get
through
his
share
of
this
country
business
he
might
do
worse
than
bring
his
beautiful
thelma
to
the
lake
of
como
for
a
while
i
ask
him
and
having
lit
their
havannas
successfully
they
walked
on
and
soon
disappeared
for
one
instant
thelma
felt
strongly
inclined
to
run
after
them
like
a
little
forlorn
child
that
had
lost
its
way
and
unburdening
herself
of
all
her
miseries
to
the
sympathetic
george
entreat
with
tears
to
be
taken
back
to
that
husband
who
did
not
want
her
any
more
but
she
soon
overcame
this
emotion
and
calling
to
mind
the
instructions
of
the
official
personage
whose
advice
she
had
sought
she
hurried
out
of
the
huge
brilliantly
lit
station
and
taking
a
hansom
was
driven
as
she
requested
to
the
midland
here
the
rather
gloomy
aspect
of
the
place
oppressed
her
as
much
as
the
garish
bustle
of
charing
cross
had
bewildered
her
but
she
was
somewhat
relieved
when
she
learned
that
a
train
for
hull
would
start
in
ten
minutes
hurrying
to
the
she
found
there
before
her
a
kindly
faced
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
who
was
just
taking
a
ticket
to
hull
and
as
she
felt
lonely
and
timid
thelma
at
once
decided
to
travel
also
and
if
possible
in
the
same
compartment
with
this
cheerful
matron
who
as
soon
as
she
had
secured
her
ticket
walked
away
to
the
train
hushing
her
infant
in
her
arms
as
she
went
thelma
followed
her
at
a
little
distance
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
enter
a
carriage
she
hastened
her
steps
and
entered
also
quite
thankful
to
have
secured
some
companionship
for
the
long
cold
journey
the
woman
glanced
at
her
a
little
curiously
it
was
strange
to
see
so
lovely
and
young
a
creature
travelling
all
alone
at
night
and
she
asked
kindly
be
you
goin
fur
miss
thelma
smiled
it
was
pleasant
to
be
spoken
to
she
thought
yes
she
answered
all
the
way
to
hull
is
a
cold
night
for
a
journey
continued
her
companion
yes
indeed
answered
thelma
it
must
be
cold
for
your
little
baby
and
unconsciously
her
voice
softened
and
her
eyes
grew
sad
as
she
looked
across
at
the
sleeping
infant
oh
he
as
warm
as
toast
laughed
the
mother
cheerily
he
gets
the
best
of
everything
he
do
it
yourself
that
looking
cold
my
dear
in
spite
of
your
warm
cloak
will
ye
have
this
shawl
and
she
offered
thelma
a
homely
gray
woollen
wrap
with
much
kindly
earnestness
of
manner
i
am
quite
warm
thank
you
said
thelma
gently
accepting
the
shawl
however
to
please
her
it
is
a
headache
i
have
which
makes
me
look
pale
and
i
am
very
very
tired
her
voice
trembled
a
little
she
sighed
and
closed
her
eyes
she
felt
strangely
weak
and
giddy
she
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
from
herself
and
from
all
the
comprehension
of
life
she
wondered
vaguely
who
and
what
she
was
had
her
marriage
with
philip
been
all
a
dream
perhaps
she
had
never
left
the
altenfjord
after
all
perhaps
she
would
wake
up
presently
and
see
the
old
quite
unchanged
with
the
doves
flying
about
the
roof
and
sigurd
wandering
under
the
pines
as
was
his
custom
ah
dear
sigurd
poor
sigurd
he
had
loved
her
she
thought
nay
he
loved
her
still
he
could
not
be
dead
oh
yes
she
must
have
been
dreaming
she
felt
certain
she
was
lying
on
her
own
little
white
bed
at
home
asleep
she
would
open
her
eyes
and
get
up
and
look
through
her
little
latticed
window
and
see
the
sun
sparkling
on
the
water
and
the
at
the
anchor
in
the
fjord
and
her
father
would
ask
sir
philip
and
his
friends
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
the
and
philip
would
come
and
stroll
with
her
through
the
garden
and
down
to
the
shore
and
would
talk
to
her
in
that
low
caressing
voice
of
his
and
though
she
loved
him
dearly
she
must
never
never
let
him
know
of
it
because
she
was
not
worthy
she
woke
from
these
musings
with
a
violent
start
and
a
sick
shiver
running
through
all
her
frame
and
looking
wildly
about
her
saw
that
she
was
reclining
on
some
one
shoulder
some
one
was
dabbing
a
wet
handkerchief
on
her
forehead
her
hat
was
off
and
her
cloak
was
loosened
there
my
dear
you
better
now
said
a
kindly
voice
in
her
ear
lor
i
thought
you
was
dead
that
i
did
was
a
bad
faint
indeed
and
with
the
train
jolting
along
like
this
too
it
was
lucky
i
had
a
flask
of
cold
water
with
me
raise
your
head
a
little
that
it
poor
thing
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
you
not
fit
to
travel
my
dear
you
not
indeed
thelma
raised
herself
slowly
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
kissed
the
good
woman
honest
rosy
face
to
her
intense
astonishment
and
pleasure
you
are
very
kind
to
me
she
said
tremulously
i
am
so
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
i
do
feel
ill
but
it
will
soon
pass
and
she
smoothed
her
ruffled
hair
and
sitting
up
erect
endeavored
to
smile
her
companion
eyed
her
pale
face
compassionately
and
taking
up
her
sleeping
baby
from
the
shawl
on
which
she
had
laid
it
while
ministering
to
thelma
needs
began
to
rock
it
slowly
to
and
fro
thelma
meanwhile
became
sensible
of
the
rapid
movement
of
the
train
we
have
left
london
she
asked
with
an
air
of
surprise
nearly
half
an
hour
ago
my
dear
then
after
a
pause
during
which
she
had
watched
thelma
very
closely
she
said
i
think
you
married
are
you
dearie
yes
thelma
answered
a
slight
tinge
of
color
warming
her
fair
pale
cheeks
your
husband
maybe
will
meet
you
at
hull
no
he
is
in
london
said
thelma
simply
i
am
going
to
see
my
father
this
answer
satisfied
her
humble
friend
who
noticing
her
extreme
fatigue
and
the
effort
it
cost
her
to
speak
forbore
to
ask
any
more
questions
but
recommended
her
to
try
and
sleep
she
slept
soundly
herself
for
the
greater
part
of
the
journey
but
thelma
was
now
feverishly
wide
awake
and
her
eyeballs
ached
and
burned
as
though
there
were
fire
behind
them
gradually
her
nerves
began
to
be
wound
up
to
an
extreme
tension
of
excitement
she
forgot
all
her
troubles
in
listening
with
painful
intentness
to
the
rush
and
roar
of
the
train
through
the
darkness
the
lights
of
passing
stations
and
gleamed
like
scattered
and
flying
stars
there
was
the
frequent
shriek
of
the
the
of
escaping
steam
she
peered
through
the
window
all
was
blackness
there
seemed
to
be
no
earth
no
sky
only
a
sable
chaos
through
which
the
train
flew
like
a
demon
always
that
rush
and
roar
she
began
to
feel
as
if
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
she
must
escape
from
that
continuous
confusing
sound
it
maddened
her
brain
nothing
was
easier
she
would
open
the
and
get
out
surely
she
could
manage
to
jump
off
the
step
even
though
the
train
was
in
motion
danger
she
smiled
at
that
idea
there
was
no
danger
and
if
there
was
it
did
not
much
matter
nothing
mattered
now
now
that
she
had
lost
her
husband
love
she
glanced
at
the
woman
opposite
who
slept
profoundly
the
baby
had
slipped
a
little
from
its
mother
arms
and
lay
with
its
tiny
face
turned
towards
thelma
it
was
a
pretty
creature
with
soft
cheeks
and
a
sweet
little
mouth
she
looked
at
it
with
a
vague
wild
smile
again
again
that
rush
and
roar
surged
like
a
storm
in
her
ears
and
distracted
her
mind
she
rose
suddenly
and
seized
the
handle
of
the
carriage
door
another
instant
and
she
would
have
sprang
to
certain
death
when
suddenly
the
sleeping
baby
woke
and
opening
its
mild
blue
eyes
gazed
at
her
she
met
its
glance
as
one
fascinated
almost
unconsciously
her
fingers
dropped
from
the
the
little
baby
still
looked
at
her
in
dreamlike
meditative
fashion
its
mother
slept
profoundly
she
bent
lower
and
lower
over
the
child
with
a
beating
heart
she
ventured
to
touch
the
small
pink
hand
that
lay
outside
its
wrappings
like
a
softly
curved
with
a
sort
of
confidence
and
contentment
the
feeble
wee
fingers
closed
and
curled
round
hers
and
held
her
fast
weak
as
a
silken
thread
yet
stronger
in
its
persuasive
force
than
a
grasp
of
iron
that
soft
light
pressure
controlled
and
restrained
her
very
gradually
the
mists
of
her
mind
cleared
the
rattling
thunderous
dash
of
the
train
grew
less
dreadful
less
monotonous
less
painful
to
her
sense
of
hearing
her
bosom
heaved
convulsively
and
all
suddenly
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
merciful
tears
which
at
first
welled
up
slowly
and
were
hot
as
fire
but
which
soon
began
to
fall
faster
and
faster
in
large
bright
drops
down
her
pale
cheeks
seeing
that
its
mother
still
slept
she
took
the
baby
gently
into
her
own
fair
arms
and
rocked
it
to
and
fro
with
many
a
sobbing
murmur
of
tenderness
the
little
thing
smiled
drowsily
and
soon
fell
asleep
again
all
unconscious
that
its
timely
look
and
innocent
touch
had
saved
poor
thelma
life
and
reason
she
meanwhile
wept
on
softly
till
her
tired
brain
and
heart
were
somewhat
relieved
of
their
heavy
burden
the
entanglement
of
her
thoughts
became
unravelled
and
though
keenly
aware
of
the
blank
desolation
of
her
life
she
was
able
to
raise
herself
in
spirit
to
the
giver
of
all
love
and
consolation
and
to
pray
humbly
for
that
patience
and
resignation
which
now
alone
could
serve
her
needs
and
she
communed
with
herself
and
god
in
silence
as
the
train
rushed
on
northwards
her
woke
up
as
they
were
nearing
their
destination
and
seeing
her
holding
the
baby
was
profuse
in
her
thanks
for
this
kindness
and
when
they
at
last
reached
hull
about
half
an
hour
after
midnight
the
good
woman
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
know
if
she
could
be
of
any
service
but
thelma
gently
yet
firmly
refused
all
her
offers
of
assistance
they
parted
in
the
most
friendly
manner
thelma
kissing
the
child
through
whose
unconscious
means
as
she
now
owned
to
herself
she
had
escaped
a
terrible
death
and
then
she
went
directly
to
a
quiet
hotel
she
knew
of
which
was
kept
by
a
native
of
christiania
a
man
who
had
formerly
been
acquainted
with
her
father
at
first
when
this
worthy
individual
saw
a
lady
arrive
alone
young
richly
dressed
and
without
luggage
he
was
inclined
to
be
suspicious
but
as
soon
as
she
addressed
him
in
norwegian
and
told
him
who
she
was
he
greeted
her
with
the
utmost
deference
and
humility
the
daughter
of
jarl
güldmar
he
said
continuing
to
speak
in
his
own
tongue
honors
my
house
by
entering
it
thelma
smiled
a
little
the
days
of
the
great
jarls
are
past
friedhof
she
replied
somewhat
sadly
and
my
father
is
content
to
be
what
he
is
a
simple
friedhof
shook
his
head
quite
obstinately
a
jarl
is
always
a
jarl
he
declared
nothing
can
alter
a
man
birth
and
nature
and
the
last
time
i
saw
valdemar
svensen
he
who
lives
with
your
father
now
he
was
careful
always
to
speak
of
the
and
seldom
or
never
did
he
mention
him
in
any
other
fashion
and
now
noble
fröken
in
what
manner
can
i
serve
you
thelma
told
him
briefly
that
she
was
going
to
see
her
father
on
business
and
that
she
was
desirous
of
starting
for
norway
the
next
day
as
early
as
possible
friedhof
held
up
his
hands
in
amazement
ah
most
surely
you
forget
he
exclaimed
using
the
picturesque
expressions
of
his
native
speech
that
this
is
the
sleeping
time
of
the
sun
even
at
the
hardanger
fjord
it
is
dark
and
silent
the
falling
streams
freeze
with
cold
on
their
way
and
if
it
is
so
at
the
hardanger
what
will
it
be
at
the
alten
and
there
is
no
passenger
ship
going
to
christiania
or
bergen
for
a
fortnight
thelma
clasped
her
hands
in
dismay
but
i
go
she
cried
impatiently
i
must
indeed
good
friedhof
i
can
not
stay
here
surely
surely
there
is
some
vessel
that
would
take
me
some
fishing
boat
what
does
it
matter
how
i
travel
so
long
as
i
get
away
the
landlord
looked
at
her
rather
wonderingly
nay
if
it
is
indeed
so
urgent
noble
fröken
he
replied
do
not
trouble
for
there
is
a
means
of
making
the
journey
but
for
and
in
such
bitter
weather
it
seems
a
cruelty
to
speak
of
it
a
steam
leaves
here
for
hammerfest
and
the
north
cape
it
will
pass
the
altenfjord
no
doubt
you
could
go
with
that
if
you
so
choose
but
there
will
be
no
warmth
or
comfort
and
there
are
heavy
storms
on
the
north
sea
i
know
the
captain
and
is
true
he
takes
his
wife
with
him
so
there
would
be
a
woman
on
board
yet
thelma
interrupted
him
she
pressed
two
sovereigns
into
his
hand
say
no
more
friedhof
she
said
eagerly
you
will
take
me
to
see
this
captain
you
will
tell
him
i
must
go
with
him
my
father
will
thank
you
for
this
kindness
to
me
even
better
than
i
can
it
does
not
seem
to
me
a
kindness
at
all
returned
friedhof
with
frank
bluntness
i
would
be
loth
to
sail
the
seas
myself
in
such
weather
and
i
thought
you
were
so
grandly
married
fröken
güldmar
though
i
forget
your
wedded
name
how
comes
it
that
your
husband
is
not
with
you
he
is
very
busy
in
london
answered
thelma
he
knows
where
i
am
going
do
not
be
at
all
anxious
friedhof
i
shall
make
the
journey
very
well
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
storm
or
wild
seas
friedhof
still
looked
dubious
but
finally
yielded
to
her
entreaties
and
agreed
to
arrange
her
passage
for
her
in
the
morning
she
stayed
at
his
hotel
that
night
and
with
the
very
early
dawn
accompanied
him
on
board
the
ship
he
had
mentioned
it
was
a
small
awkwardly
built
craft
with
an
ugly
crooked
black
funnel
out
of
which
the
steam
was
hissing
and
spitting
with
quite
an
unnecessary
degree
of
violence
the
decks
were
wet
and
dirty
and
the
whole
vessel
was
pervaded
with
a
sickening
smell
of
the
captain
a
gruff
fellow
looked
rather
surlily
at
his
unexpected
passenger
but
was
soon
mollified
by
her
gentle
manner
and
the
readiness
with
which
she
paid
the
money
he
demanded
for
taking
her
you
wo
be
very
warm
he
said
eyeing
her
from
head
to
foot
but
i
can
lend
you
a
rug
to
sleep
in
thelma
smiled
and
thanked
him
he
called
to
his
wife
a
thin
creature
who
put
up
her
head
from
a
window
in
the
cabin
at
his
summons
here
a
lady
going
with
us
he
announced
look
after
her
will
you
the
woman
nodded
then
once
more
addressing
himself
to
thelma
he
said
we
shall
have
nasty
weather
and
a
wicked
sea
i
do
not
mind
she
answered
quietly
and
turning
to
friedhof
who
had
come
to
see
her
off
she
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
and
thanked
him
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
in
her
behalf
the
good
landlord
bade
her
farewell
somewhat
reluctantly
he
had
a
presentiment
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
and
that
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
prevented
her
making
this
uncomfortable
and
possibly
perilous
voyage
but
it
was
too
late
now
and
at
a
little
before
seven
the
vessel
which
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
the
left
the
harbor
and
steamed
fussily
down
the
humber
in
the
teeth
of
a
sudden
storm
of
sleet
and
snow
her
departure
had
no
interest
for
any
one
save
friedhof
who
stood
watching
her
till
she
was
no
more
than
a
speck
on
the
turbid
water
he
kept
his
post
regardless
of
the
piercing
cold
of
the
gusty
early
morning
air
till
she
had
entirely
disappeared
and
then
returned
to
his
own
house
and
his
daily
business
in
a
rather
depressed
frame
of
mind
he
was
haunted
by
the
pale
face
and
serious
eyes
of
thelma
she
looked
very
ill
he
thought
he
began
to
reproach
himself
why
had
he
been
such
a
fool
as
to
let
her
go
why
had
he
not
detained
her
or
at
any
rate
persuaded
her
to
rest
a
few
days
in
hull
he
looked
at
the
threatening
sky
and
the
falling
flakes
of
snow
with
a
shiver
what
weather
he
muttered
and
there
must
be
a
darkness
as
of
death
at
the
altenfjord
meanwhile
the
unhandsome
as
she
was
in
appearance
struggled
gallantly
with
and
overcame
an
army
of
furious
waves
that
rose
to
greet
her
as
she
rounded
spurn
head
and
long
ere
thelma
closed
her
weary
eyes
in
an
effort
to
sleep
was
plunging
shivering
and
fighting
her
slow
way
through
shattering
mountainous
billows
and
a
tempest
of
sleet
snow
and
tossing
foam
across
the
wild
north

her

without

the
blank
grey
there
where
the

is

her

her
the

empty

dante
rossetti
good
god
cried
errington
impatiently
what
the
matter
speak
out
he
had
just
arrived
home
he
had
barely
set
foot
within
his
own
door
and
full
of
ardor
and
eagerness
was
about
to
hasten
to
his
wife
room
when
his
old
servant
morris
stood
in
his
way
trembling
and
looking
helplessly
from
him
to
neville
who
was
as
much
astonished
as
sir
philip
at
the
man
appearance
something
has
happened
he
stammered
faintly
at
last
her
ladyship
philip
started
his
heart
beat
quickly
and
then
seemed
to
grow
still
with
a
horrible
sensation
of
fear
what
of
her
he
demanded
in
low
hoarse
tones
is
she
ill
morris
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
sir
philip
my
dear
master
cried
the
poor
old
man
i
do
not
know
whether
she
is
ill
or
well
i
can
not
guess
my
lady
went
out
last
night
at
a
little
before
eight
and
and
she
has
never
come
home
at
all
we
can
not
tell
what
has
become
of
her
she
has
gone
and
tears
of
distress
and
anxiety
filled
his
eyes
philip
stood
mute
he
could
not
understand
it
all
color
fled
from
his
face
he
seemed
as
though
he
had
received
a
sudden
blow
on
the
head
which
had
stunned
him
gone
he
said
mechanically
thelma
my
wife
gone
why
should
she
go
and
he
stared
fixedly
at
neville
who
laid
one
hand
soothingly
on
his
arm
perhaps
she
is
with
friends
he
suggested
she
may
be
at
lady
winsleigh
or
mrs
lorimer
no
no
interrupted
morris
britta
who
stayed
up
all
night
for
her
has
since
been
to
every
house
that
my
lady
visits
and
no
one
has
seen
or
heard
of
her
where
is
britta
demanded
philip
suddenly
she
has
gone
again
to
lady
winsleigh
answered
morris
she
says
it
is
there
that
mischief
has
been
done
i
do
know
what
she
means
philip
shook
off
his
secretary
sympathetic
touch
and
strode
through
the
rooms
to
thelma
boudoir
he
put
aside
the
velvet
curtains
of
the
portiere
with
a
noiseless
hand
somehow
he
felt
as
if
in
spite
of
all
he
had
just
heard
she
be
there
as
usual
to
welcome
him
with
that
serene
sweet
smile
which
was
the
sunshine
of
his
life
the
empty
desolate
air
of
the
room
smote
him
with
a
sense
of
bitter
pain
only
the
plaintive
warble
of
her
pet
thrush
who
was
singing
to
himself
most
mournfully
in
his
gilded
cage
broke
the
heavy
silence
he
looked
about
him
vacantly
all
sorts
of
dark
forebodings
crowded
on
his
mind
she
must
have
met
with
some
accident
he
thought
with
a
shudder
for
that
she
would
depart
from
him
in
this
sudden
way
of
her
own
accord
for
no
reason
whatsoever
seemed
to
him
incredible
impossible
what
have
i
done
that
she
should
leave
me
he
asked
half
aloud
and
wonderingly
everything
that
had
seemed
to
him
of
worth
a
few
hours
ago
became
valueless
in
this
moment
of
time
what
cared
he
now
for
the
business
of
parliament
for
distinction
or
honors
among
men
nothing
less
than
nothing
without
her
the
world
was
empty
its
ambitions
its
pride
its
good
its
evil
seemed
but
the
dreariest
and
most
foolish
trifles
not
even
a
message
he
thought
no
hint
of
where
she
meant
to
go
no
word
of
explanation
for
me
surely
i
must
be
dreaming
my
thelma
would
never
have
deserted
me
a
sort
of
sob
rose
in
his
throat
and
he
pressed
his
hand
strongly
over
his
eyes
to
keep
down
the
womanish
drops
that
threatened
to
overflow
them
after
a
minute
or
two
he
went
to
her
desk
and
opened
it
thinking
that
there
perhaps
she
might
have
left
a
note
of
farewell
there
was
nothing
nothing
save
a
little
heap
of
money
and
jewels
these
thelma
had
herself
placed
before
her
sorrowful
silent
departure
in
the
corner
where
he
now
found
them
more
puzzled
than
ever
he
glanced
searchingly
round
the
room
and
his
eyes
were
at
once
attracted
by
the
sparkle
of
the
diamond
cross
that
lay
uppermost
on
the
cover
of
gladys
the
singer
the
book
of
poems
which
was
in
its
usual
place
on
his
own
reading
table
in
another
second
he
seized
it
he
unwound
the
slight
gold
chain
he
opened
the
little
volume
tremblingly
yes
there
was
a
letter
within
its
pages
addressed
to
himself
now
now
he
should
know
all
he
tore
it
open
with
feverish
haste
two
folded
sheets
of
paper
fell
out
one
was
his
own
epistle
to
violet
vere
and
this
to
his
consternation
he
perceived
first
full
of
a
sudden
misgiving
he
laid
it
aside
and
began
to
read
thelma
parting
words
my
darling
boy
she
wrote
a
friend
of
yours
and
mine
brought
me
the
enclosed
letter
and
though
perhaps
it
was
wrong
of
me
to
read
it
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
having
done
so
i
do
not
quite
understand
it
and
i
can
not
bear
to
think
about
it
but
it
seems
that
you
are
tired
of
your
poor
thelma
i
do
not
blame
you
dearest
for
i
am
sure
that
in
some
way
or
other
the
fault
is
mine
and
it
does
grieve
me
so
much
to
think
you
are
unhappy
i
know
that
i
am
very
ignorant
of
many
things
and
that
i
am
not
suited
to
this
london
life
and
i
fear
i
shall
never
understand
its
ways
but
one
thing
i
can
do
and
that
is
to
let
you
be
free
my
philip
quite
free
and
so
i
am
going
back
to
the
altenfjord
where
i
will
stay
till
you
want
me
again
if
you
ever
do
my
heart
is
yours
and
i
shall
always
love
you
till
i
die
and
though
it
seems
to
me
just
now
better
that
we
should
part
to
give
you
greater
ease
and
pleasure
still
you
must
always
remember
that
i
have
no
reproaches
to
make
to
you
i
am
only
sorry
to
think
my
love
has
wearied
you
for
you
have
been
all
goodness
and
tenderness
to
me
and
so
that
people
shall
not
talk
about
me
or
you
you
will
simply
say
to
them
that
i
have
gone
to
see
my
father
and
they
will
think
nothing
strange
in
that
be
kind
to
britta
i
have
told
her
nothing
as
it
would
only
make
her
miserable
do
not
be
angry
that
i
go
away
i
can
not
bear
to
stay
here
knowing
all
and
so
my
love
my
dearest
one
if
you
were
to
love
many
women
more
than
me
i
still
should
love
you
best
i
still
would
gladly
die
to
serve
you
remember
this
always
that
however
long
we
may
be
parted
and
though
all
the
world
should
come
between
us
i
am
and
ever
shall
be
your
faithful
wife
thelma
the
ejaculation
that
broke
from
errington
lips
as
he
finished
reading
this
letter
was
more
powerful
than
reverent
stinging
tears
darted
to
his
eyes
he
pressed
his
lips
passionately
on
the
fair
writing
my
darling
my
darling
he
murmured
what
a
miserable
misunderstanding
then
without
another
moment
delay
he
rushed
into
neville
study
and
cried
abruptly
look
here
it
all
your
fault
fault
gasped
the
amazed
secretary
yes
your
fault
shouted
errington
almost
beside
himself
with
grief
and
rage
your
fault
and
that
of
your
accursed
violet
vere
and
he
dashed
the
letter
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
furiously
down
on
the
table
neville
shrank
and
shivered
his
grey
head
drooped
he
stretched
out
his
hands
appealingly
for
god
sake
sir
philip
tell
me
what
i
done
he
exclaimed
piteously
errington
strode
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
perfect
fever
of
impatience
by
heaven
it
enough
to
drive
me
mad
he
burst
forth
your
wife
your
wife
confound
her
when
you
first
discovered
her
in
that
shameless
actress
did
i
want
to
tell
thelma
all
about
it
that
very
night
and
did
you
beg
me
not
to
do
so
your
silly
scruples
stood
in
the
way
of
everything
i
was
a
fool
to
listen
to
you
a
fool
to
meddle
in
your
affairs
and
and
i
wish
to
god
i
never
seen
or
heard
of
you
neville
turned
very
white
but
remained
speechless
read
that
letter
went
on
philip
impetuously
you
seen
it
before
it
the
last
one
i
wrote
to
your
wife
imploring
her
to
see
you
and
speak
with
you
here
it
comes
the
devil
knows
how
into
thelma
hands
she
quite
in
the
dark
about
and
fancies
i
wrote
it
on
my
own
behalf
it
looks
like
it
too
looks
exactly
as
if
i
were
pleading
for
myself
and
breaking
my
heart
over
that
detestible
by
jove
it
too
horrible
and
he
gave
a
gesture
of
loathing
and
contempt
neville
heard
him
in
utter
bewilderment
not
possible
he
muttered
not
possible
it
ca
be
ca
be
it
shouted
philip
and
if
you
let
me
tell
thelma
everything
from
the
first
all
this
would
have
happened
and
you
ask
me
what
you
done
you
parted
me
from
the
sweetest
dearest
girl
in
the
world
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
and
a
great
uncontrollable
sob
broke
from
his
lips
neville
was
in
despair
of
course
it
was
his
fault
he
saw
it
all
clearly
he
painfully
recalled
all
that
had
happened
since
that
night
at
the
brilliant
theatre
when
with
a
sickening
horror
he
had
discovered
violet
vere
to
be
no
other
than
violet
neville
his
own
little
violet
as
he
had
once
called
her
his
wife
that
he
had
lost
and
mourned
as
though
she
were
some
pure
dead
woman
lying
sweetly
at
rest
in
a
quiet
grave
he
remembered
thelma
shuddering
repugnance
at
the
sight
of
her
a
repugnance
which
he
himself
had
shared
and
which
made
him
shrink
with
fastidious
aversion
from
the
idea
of
confiding
to
any
one
but
sir
philip
the
miserable
secret
of
his
connection
with
her
sir
philip
had
humored
him
in
this
fancy
little
imagining
that
any
mischief
would
come
of
it
and
the
reward
of
his
kindly
sympathy
was
this
his
name
was
compromised
his
home
desolate
and
his
wife
estranged
from
him
in
the
first
pangs
of
the
remorse
and
sorrow
that
filled
his
heart
neville
could
gladly
have
gone
out
and
drowned
himself
presently
he
began
to
think
was
there
not
some
one
else
beside
himself
who
might
possibly
be
to
blame
for
all
this
misery
for
instance
who
could
have
brought
or
sent
that
letter
to
lady
errington
in
her
high
station
she
so
lofty
so
pure
so
far
above
the
rest
of
her
sex
would
have
been
the
last
person
to
make
any
inquiries
about
such
a
woman
as
violet
vere
how
had
it
all
happened
he
looked
imploringly
for
some
minutes
at
the
dejected
figure
in
the
chair
without
daring
to
offer
a
word
of
consolation
presently
he
ventured
a
remark
sir
philip
he
stammered
it
will
soon
be
all
right
her
ladyship
will
come
back
immediately
i
myself
will
explain
it
it
only
a
misunderstanding
errington
moved
in
his
chair
impatiently
but
said
nothing
only
a
misunderstanding
how
many
there
are
who
can
trace
back
broken
friendships
and
severed
loves
to
that
one
thing
only
a
misunderstanding
the
tenderest
relations
are
often
the
most
delicate
and
subtle
and
trifles
light
as
air
may
scatter
and
utterly
destroy
the
sensitive
gossamer
threads
extending
between
one
heart
and
another
as
easily
as
a
child
passing
foot
destroys
the
spider
web
woven
on
the
dewy
grass
in
the
early
mornings
of
spring
presently
sir
philip
started
up
his
lashes
were
wet
and
his
face
was
flushed
it
no
good
sitting
here
he
said
rapidly
buttoning
on
his
overcoat
i
must
go
after
her
let
all
the
business
go
to
the
devil
write
and
say
i
wo
stand
for
middleborough
i
resign
in
favor
of
the
liberal
candidate
i
off
to
norway
to
norway
cried
neville
has
she
gone
at
this
season
he
broke
off
for
at
that
moment
britta
entered
looking
the
picture
of
misery
her
face
was
pale
and
drawn
her
eyelids
red
and
swollen
and
when
she
saw
sir
philip
she
gave
him
a
glance
of
the
most
despairing
reproach
and
indignation
he
sprang
up
to
her
any
news
he
demanded
britta
shook
her
head
mournfully
the
tears
beginning
to
roll
again
down
her
cheeks
oh
if
i
only
thought
she
sobbed
if
i
only
known
what
the
dear
fröken
meant
to
do
when
she
said
to
me
last
night
i
could
have
prevented
her
going
i
could
i
would
have
told
her
all
i
know
and
she
would
have
stayed
to
see
you
oh
sir
philip
if
you
had
only
been
here
that
wicked
wicked
lady
winsleigh
have
driven
her
away
at
this
name
such
a
fury
filled
philip
heart
that
he
could
barely
control
himself
he
breathed
quickly
and
heavily
what
of
her
he
demanded
in
a
low
suffocated
voice
what
has
lady
winsleigh
to
do
with
it
britta
everything
cried
britta
though
as
she
glanced
at
his
set
stern
face
and
paling
lips
she
began
to
feel
a
little
frightened
she
has
always
hated
the
fröken
and
been
jealous
of
her
always
her
own
maid
louise
will
tell
you
so
lord
winsleigh
man
briggs
will
tell
you
so
they
listened
at
the
doors
and
they
know
all
about
it
britta
made
this
statement
with
the
most
childlike
candor
and
they
heard
all
sorts
of
wicked
things
lady
winsleigh
was
always
talking
to
sir
francis
lennox
about
the
fröken
and
now
they
made
her
believe
you
do
not
care
for
her
any
more
they
been
trying
to
make
her
believe
everything
bad
of
you
for
ever
so
many
months
she
paused
terrified
at
sir
philip
increasing
pallor
go
on
britta
he
said
quietly
though
his
voice
sounded
strange
to
himself
britta
gathered
up
all
her
remaining
stock
of
courage
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
continued
desperately
i
understand
london
people
at
all
and
i
never
shall
understand
them
everybody
seems
to
want
to
be
wicked
briggs
says
that
lady
winsleigh
was
fond
of
sir
philip
then
that
she
was
fond
of
sir
francis
lennox
and
yet
she
has
a
husband
of
her
own
all
the
time
it
is
so
very
strange
and
the
little
maiden
perplexity
appeared
to
border
on
distraction
they
would
think
such
a
woman
quite
mad
in
norway
but
what
is
worse
than
anything
is
that
you
you
sir
philip
oh
i
believe
it
and
she
stamped
her
foot
passionately
i
believe
it
and
yet
everybody
says
that
you
go
to
see
a
dreadful
painted
dancing
woman
at
the
theatre
and
that
you
like
her
better
than
the
fröken
it
true
is
it
here
she
peered
anxiously
at
her
master
but
he
was
absolutely
silent
neville
made
as
though
he
would
speak
but
a
gesture
from
sir
philip
hand
restrained
him
britta
went
on
rather
dispiritedly
anyhow
briggs
has
just
told
me
that
only
yesterday
lady
winsleigh
went
all
by
herself
to
see
this
actress
and
that
she
got
some
letter
there
which
she
brought
to
the
fröken
she
recoiled
suddenly
with
a
little
scream
oh
sir
philip
where
are
you
going
errington
hand
came
down
on
her
shoulder
as
he
twisted
her
lightly
out
of
his
path
and
strode
to
the
door
sir
philip
sir
philip
cried
neville
anxiously
hastening
after
him
think
for
a
moment
do
do
anything
rash
philip
wrung
his
hand
convulsively
rash
my
good
fellow
it
a
who
has
slandered
me
what
i
do
her
sex
protects
her
he
gave
a
short
furious
laugh
but
by
god
were
she
a
man
i
shoot
her
dead
and
with
these
words
and
his
eyes
blazing
with
wrath
he
left
the
room
neville
and
britta
confronted
each
other
in
vague
alarm
where
will
he
go
half
whispered
britta
to
winsleigh
house
i
suppose
answered
neville
in
the
same
low
tone
just
then
the
hall
door
shut
with
a
loud
bang
that
echoed
through
the
silent
house
he
gone
and
as
neville
said
this
he
sighed
and
looked
dubiously
at
his
companion
how
do
you
know
all
this
about
lady
winsleigh
britta
it
may
not
be
true
it
only
servants
gossip
only
servants
gossip
exclaimed
britta
and
is
that
nothing
why
in
these
grand
houses
like
lord
winsleigh
the
servants
know
everything
briggs
makes
it
his
business
to
listen
at
the
doors
he
says
it
a
part
of
his
duty
and
louise
opens
all
her
mistress
letters
she
says
she
owes
it
to
her
own
respectability
to
know
what
sort
of
a
lady
it
is
she
serves
and
she
going
to
leave
because
she
says
her
ladyship
respectable
there
what
do
you
think
of
that
and
sir
philip
will
find
out
a
great
deal
more
than
even
have
told
him
but
oh
i
understand
about
that
actress
and
she
shook
her
head
despairingly
britta
said
neville
suddenly
that
actress
is
my
wife
britta
started
and
her
round
eyes
opened
wide
your
wife
mr
neville
she
exclaimed
neville
took
off
his
spectacles
and
polished
them
nervously
yes
britta
my
wife
she
looked
at
him
in
amazed
silence
neville
went
on
rubbing
his
glasses
and
continued
in
rather
dreamy
tremulous
accents
yes
i
lost
her
years
ago
i
thought
she
was
dead
but
i
found
her
on
the
stage
of
the
brilliant
theatre
i
i
never
expected
i
would
rather
she
had
died
he
paused
and
went
on
softly
when
i
married
her
britta
she
was
such
a
dear
little
girl
so
bright
and
pretty
and
i
i
fancied
she
was
fond
of
me
yes
i
did
of
course
i
was
foolish
i
always
been
foolish
i
think
and
when
when
i
saw
her
on
that
stage
i
felt
as
if
some
one
had
struck
me
a
hard
blow
it
seems
as
if
i
been
stunned
ever
since
and
though
she
knows
i
in
london
she
wo
see
me
britta
she
wo
let
me
speak
to
her
even
for
a
moment
it
very
hard
sir
philip
has
tried
his
best
to
persuade
her
to
see
me
he
has
talked
to
her
and
written
to
her
about
me
and
that
not
all
he
has
even
tried
to
make
her
come
back
to
me
but
it
all
no
use
and
and
that
how
all
the
mischief
has
arisen
do
you
see
britta
gazed
at
him
still
with
sympathy
written
on
every
line
of
her
face
but
a
great
load
had
been
lifted
from
her
mind
by
his
words
she
began
to
understand
everything
i
so
sorry
for
you
mr
neville
she
said
but
why
did
you
tell
all
this
to
the
fröken
i
murmured
neville
desperately
she
was
there
that
night
at
the
brilliant
and
if
you
had
seen
how
she
looked
when
she
saw
my
wife
appeared
on
the
stage
so
pained
so
sorry
so
ashamed
and
she
wanted
to
leave
the
theatre
at
once
of
course
i
ought
to
have
told
her
i
wish
i
had
but
somehow
i
never
could
he
paused
again
all
my
stupidity
of
course
sir
philip
is
quite
blameless
he
has
been
the
kindest
the
best
of
friends
to
me
his
voice
trembled
more
and
more
and
he
could
not
go
on
there
was
a
silence
of
some
minutes
during
which
britta
appeared
absorbed
in
meditation
and
neville
furtively
wiped
his
eyes
presently
he
spoke
again
more
cheerfully
it
soon
be
all
right
again
britta
and
he
nodded
encouragingly
sir
philip
says
her
ladyship
has
gone
home
to
norway
and
he
means
to
follow
her
britta
nodded
gravely
but
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
i
posted
her
letter
to
her
father
she
half
murmured
oh
if
i
had
only
thought
or
guessed
why
it
was
written
is
it
rather
a
bad
time
of
the
year
for
norway
pursued
neville
why
there
must
be
snow
and
darkness
snow
and
darkness
at
the
altenfjord
suddenly
cried
britta
catching
at
his
words
that
exactly
what
she
said
to
me
the
other
evening
oh
dear
i
never
thought
of
it
i
never
remembered
it
was
the
dark
season
she
clasped
her
hands
in
dismay
there
is
no
sun
at
the
altenfjord
now
it
is
like
night
and
the
cold
is
bitter
and
she
is
not
strong
not
strong
enough
to
travel
and
there
the
north
sea
to
cross
oh
neville
and
she
broke
out
sobbing
afresh
the
journey
will
kill
her
i
know
it
will
my
poor
poor
darling
i
must
go
after
her
i
go
with
sir
philip
i
be
left
behind
hush
hush
britta
said
neville
kindly
patting
her
shoulder
cry
do
cry
but
he
was
very
near
crying
himself
poor
man
so
shaken
was
he
by
the
events
of
the
morning
and
he
could
not
help
admitting
to
himself
the
possibility
that
so
long
and
trying
a
journey
for
thelma
in
her
present
condition
of
health
meant
little
else
than
serious
illness
perhaps
death
the
only
comfort
he
could
suggest
to
the
disconsolate
britta
was
that
at
that
time
of
year
it
was
very
probable
there
would
be
no
steamer
running
to
christiansund
or
bergen
and
in
that
case
thelma
would
be
unable
to
leave
england
and
would
therefore
be
overtaken
by
sir
philip
at
hull
meanwhile
sir
philip
himself
in
a
white
heat
of
restrained
anger
arrived
at
winsleigh
house
and
asked
to
see
lord
winsleigh
immediately
briggs
who
opened
the
door
to
him
was
a
little
startled
at
his
haggard
face
and
blazing
eyes
even
though
he
knew
through
britta
all
about
the
sorrow
that
had
befallen
him
briggs
was
not
surprised
at
lady
errington
departure
that
portion
of
his
duty
which
consisted
in
listening
at
doors
had
greatly
enlightened
him
on
many
points
all
save
one
the
reported
connection
between
sir
philip
and
violet
vere
this
seemed
to
be
really
true
according
to
all
appearances
which
it
puzzles
me
soliloquized
the
owner
of
the
shapely
calves
it
do
indeed
yet
i
feels
very
much
for
sir
philip
i
said
to
flopsie
this
morning
i
feels
for
yes
i
used
them
very
words
only
of
course
he
should
gone
with
vi
she
a
fine
woman
certainly
but
skittish
d
d
skittish
i
allus
made
it
a
rule
myself
to
avoid
on
principle
lor
if
i
kep
company
with
and
the
likes
of
i
should
be
the
man
i
am
and
he
smiled
complacently
lord
winsleigh
who
was
in
his
library
as
usual
occupied
with
his
duties
as
tutor
to
his
son
ernest
rose
to
receive
sir
philip
with
an
air
of
more
than
his
usual
gravity
i
was
about
to
write
to
you
errington
he
began
and
then
stopped
short
touched
by
the
utter
misery
expressed
in
philip
face
he
addressed
ernest
with
a
sort
of
nervous
haste
run
away
my
boy
to
your
own
room
i
send
for
you
again
presently
ernest
obeyed
now
said
lord
winsleigh
as
soon
as
the
lad
disappeared
tell
me
everything
errington
is
it
true
that
your
wife
has
left
you
left
me
and
philip
eyes
flashed
with
passionate
anger
no
winsleigh
she
been
driven
away
from
me
by
the
vilest
and
most
heartless
cruelty
she
been
made
to
believe
a
scandalous
and
abominable
lie
against
me
and
she
gone
i
i
by
jove
i
hardly
like
to
say
it
to
your
face
but
i
understand
a
curious
flicker
of
a
smile
shadowed
rather
than
brightened
lord
winsleigh
stern
features
pray
speak
quite
plainly
lady
winsleigh
is
to
blame
i
am
not
at
all
surprised
errington
gave
him
a
rapid
glance
of
wonder
he
had
always
fancied
winsleigh
to
be
a
studious
rather
dull
sort
of
man
absorbed
in
books
and
the
education
of
his
son
a
man
more
than
half
blind
to
everything
that
went
on
around
him
and
moreover
one
who
deliberately
shut
his
eyes
to
the
frivolous
coquetry
of
his
wife
and
though
he
liked
him
fairly
well
there
had
been
a
sort
of
vague
contempt
mingled
with
his
liking
now
a
new
light
was
suddenly
thrown
on
his
character
there
was
something
in
his
look
his
manner
his
very
tone
of
voice
which
proved
to
errington
that
there
was
a
deep
and
forcible
side
to
his
nature
of
which
his
closest
friends
had
never
dreamed
and
he
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
discovery
seeing
that
he
still
hesitated
winsleigh
laid
a
hand
encouragingly
on
his
shoulder
and
said
i
repeat
i
not
at
all
surprised
nothing
that
lady
winsleigh
might
do
would
cause
me
the
slightest
astonishment
she
has
long
ceased
to
be
my
wife
except
in
name
that
she
still
bears
that
name
and
holds
the
position
she
has
in
the
world
is
simply
for
my
son
sake
i
do
not
wish
his
voice
quivered
slightly
i
do
not
wish
the
boy
to
despise
his
mother
it
always
a
bad
beginning
for
a
young
man
life
i
want
to
avoid
it
for
ernest
if
possible
regardless
of
any
personal
sacrifice
he
paused
a
moment
then
resumed
now
speak
out
errington
and
plainly
for
if
mischief
has
been
done
and
i
can
repair
it
in
any
way
you
may
be
sure
i
will
thus
persuaded
sir
philip
briefly
related
the
whole
story
of
the
misunderstanding
that
had
arisen
concerning
neville
wife
violet
vere
and
concluded
by
saying
it
is
of
course
only
through
britta
that
i
just
heard
about
lady
winsleigh
having
anything
to
do
with
it
her
information
may
not
be
correct
i
hope
it
is
but
lord
winsleigh
interrupted
him
come
with
me
he
said
composedly
we
resolve
this
difficulty
at
once
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
library
across
the
hall
errington
followed
him
in
silence
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
wife
room
in
response
to
her
come
in
they
both
entered
she
was
alone
reclining
on
a
sofa
reading
she
started
up
with
a
pettish
exclamation
at
sight
of
her
husband
but
observing
who
it
was
that
came
with
him
she
stood
mute
the
color
rushing
to
her
cheeks
with
surprise
and
something
of
fear
yet
she
endeavored
to
smile
and
returned
with
her
usual
grace
their
somewhat
formal
salutations
clara
then
said
lord
winsleigh
gravely
i
have
to
ask
you
a
question
on
behalf
of
sir
philip
errington
here
a
question
to
which
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
give
the
plain
answer
did
you
or
did
you
not
procure
this
letter
from
violet
vere
of
the
brilliant
theatre
and
did
you
or
did
you
not
give
it
yourself
yesterday
into
the
hands
of
lady
and
he
laid
the
letter
in
question
which
philip
had
handed
to
him
down
upon
the
table
before
her
she
looked
at
it
then
at
him
then
from
him
to
sir
philip
who
uttered
no
word
and
lightly
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
she
said
carelessly
sir
philip
turned
upon
her
indignantly
lady
winsleigh
you
know
she
interrupted
him
with
a
stately
gesture
excuse
me
sir
philip
i
am
not
accustomed
to
be
spoken
to
in
this
extraordinary
manner
you
forget
yourself
my
husband
i
think
also
forgets
himself
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
violet
vere
i
am
not
fond
of
the
society
of
actresses
of
course
i
heard
about
your
admiration
for
her
that
is
common
though
my
informant
on
this
point
was
sir
francis
lennox
sir
francis
lennox
cried
philip
furiously
thank
god
there
a
man
to
deal
with
by
heaven
i
choke
him
with
his
own
lie
lady
winsleigh
raised
her
eyebrows
in
surprise
dear
me
it
is
a
lie
then
now
i
should
have
thought
from
all
accounts
that
it
was
so
very
likely
to
be
true
philip
turned
white
with
passion
her
sarcastic
smile
her
mocking
glance
irritated
him
almost
beyond
endurance
permit
me
to
ask
you
clara
continued
lord
winsleigh
calmly
if
you
as
you
say
know
nothing
about
violet
vere
why
did
you
go
to
the
brilliant
theatre
yesterday
morning
she
flashed
an
angry
glance
at
him
why
to
secure
a
box
for
the
new
performance
is
there
anything
wonderful
in
that
her
husband
remained
unmoved
may
i
see
the
voucher
for
this
box
he
inquired
i
sent
it
to
some
friends
replied
her
ladyship
haughtily
since
when
have
you
decided
to
become
an
inquisitor
my
lord
lady
winsleigh
said
philip
suddenly
and
eagerly
will
you
swear
to
me
that
you
have
said
or
done
nothing
to
make
my
thelma
leave
me
oh
she
left
you
has
she
and
lady
clara
smiled
maliciously
i
thought
she
would
why
do
you
ask
your
dear
friend
george
lorimer
about
her
he
is
madly
in
love
with
her
as
everybody
knows
she
is
probably
the
same
with
him
clara
clara
exclaimed
lord
winsleigh
in
accents
of
deep
reproach
shame
on
you
shame
her
ladyship
laughed
amusedly
please
do
be
tragic
she
said
too
ridiculous
sir
philip
has
only
himself
to
blame
of
course
thelma
knows
about
his
frequent
visits
to
the
brilliant
theatre
i
told
her
all
that
sir
francis
said
why
should
she
be
kept
in
the
dark
i
dare
say
she
does
mind
she
very
fond
of
mr
lorimer
errington
felt
as
though
he
must
choke
with
fury
he
forgot
the
presence
of
lord
winsleigh
he
forgot
everything
but
his
just
indignation
my
god
he
cried
passionately
you
to
speak
so
yes
i
she
returned
coolly
measuring
him
with
a
glance
i
dare
what
have
you
to
say
against
she
drew
herself
up
imperiously
then
turning
to
her
husband
she
said
have
the
goodness
to
take
your
excited
friend
away
my
lord
i
am
going
out
i
have
a
great
many
engagements
this
morning
and
i
really
can
not
stop
to
discuss
this
absurd
affair
any
longer
it
is
my
fault
that
sir
philip
excessive
admiration
for
miss
vere
has
become
the
subject
of
gossip
blame
him
for
it
he
seems
extremely
about
it
after
all
que
la
vérité
qui
blesse
and
she
smiled
maliciously
chapter
xxviii
for
my
mother
sake
for
thine
and
hers
o
love
i
pity
take
on
all
poor
women
jesu
will
be
done
honor
for
all
and
infamy
for
none
this
side
the
borders
of
the
burning
lake
eric
mackay
of
a
lord
winsleigh
did
not
move
sir
philip
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
in
silence
some
occult
fascination
forced
her
to
meet
his
glance
and
the
utter
scorn
of
it
stung
her
proud
heart
to
its
centre
not
that
she
felt
much
compunction
her
whole
soul
was
up
in
arms
against
him
and
had
been
so
from
the
very
day
she
was
first
told
of
his
unexpected
marriage
his
evident
contempt
now
irritated
her
she
was
angrier
with
him
than
ever
and
yet
she
had
a
sort
of
strange
triumph
in
the
petty
vengeance
she
had
designed
she
had
destroyed
his
happiness
for
a
time
at
least
if
she
could
but
shake
his
belief
in
his
wife
she
thought
vindictively
to
that
end
she
had
thrown
out
her
evil
hint
respecting
thelma
affection
for
george
lorimer
but
the
shaft
had
been
aimed
uselessly
errington
knew
too
well
the
stainless
purity
of
thelma
to
wrong
her
by
the
smallest
doubt
and
he
would
have
staked
his
life
on
the
loyalty
of
his
friend
presently
he
controlled
his
anger
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
speak
and
still
eyeing
her
with
that
straight
keen
look
of
immeasurable
disdain
he
said
in
cold
deliberate
accents
your
ladyship
is
in
error
the
actress
in
question
is
the
wife
of
my
secretary
neville
for
years
they
have
been
estranged
my
visits
to
her
were
entirely
on
neville
behalf
my
letters
to
her
were
all
on
the
same
subject
sir
francis
lennox
must
have
known
the
truth
all
along
violet
vere
has
been
his
mistress
for
the
past
five
years
he
uttered
the
concluding
words
with
intense
bitterness
a
strange
bewildered
horror
passed
over
lady
winsleigh
face
i
do
believe
it
she
said
rather
faintly
believe
it
or
not
it
is
true
he
replied
curtly
ask
the
manager
of
the
brilliant
if
you
doubt
me
winsleigh
it
no
use
my
stopping
here
any
longer
as
her
ladyship
refuses
to
give
any
explanation
wait
a
moment
errington
interposed
lord
winsleigh
in
his
coldest
and
most
methodical
manner
her
ladyship
refuses
but
do
not
refuse
her
ladyship
will
not
speak
she
allows
her
husband
to
speak
for
her
therefore
and
he
smiled
at
his
astonished
wife
somewhat
sardonically
i
may
tell
you
at
once
that
her
ladyship
admits
to
having
purchased
from
violet
vere
for
the
sum
of
pounds
the
letter
which
she
afterwards
took
with
her
own
hands
to
your
wife
lady
winsleigh
uttered
an
angry
exclamation
do
interrupt
me
clara
if
you
please
he
said
with
an
icy
smile
we
have
so
many
sympathies
in
common
that
i
sure
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
your
unspoken
meanings
quite
clearly
he
went
on
addressing
himself
to
errington
who
stood
utterly
amazed
her
ladyship
desires
me
to
assure
you
that
her
only
excuse
for
her
action
in
this
matter
is
that
she
fully
believed
the
reports
her
friend
sir
francis
lennox
gave
her
concerning
your
supposed
intimacy
with
the
actress
in
question
and
that
believing
it
she
made
use
of
it
as
much
as
possible
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
your
wife
peace
of
mind
and
confidence
in
you
her
object
was
most
purely
feminine
love
of
mischief
and
the
gratification
of
private
spite
there
nothing
like
frankness
and
lord
winsleigh
face
was
a
positive
study
as
he
spoke
you
see
he
made
a
slight
gesture
towards
his
wife
who
stood
speechless
and
so
pale
that
her
very
lips
were
colorless
her
ladyship
is
not
in
a
position
to
deny
what
i
have
said
excuse
her
silence
and
again
he
smiled
that
smile
as
glitteringly
chilled
as
a
gleam
of
light
on
the
edge
of
a
sword
lady
winsleigh
raised
her
head
and
her
eyes
met
his
with
a
dark
expression
of
the
uttermost
anger
spy
she
hissed
between
her
teeth
then
without
further
word
or
gesture
she
swept
haughtily
away
into
her
which
adjoined
the
boudoir
and
closed
the
door
of
communication
thus
leaving
the
two
men
alone
together
errington
felt
himself
to
be
in
a
most
painful
and
awkward
position
if
there
was
anything
he
more
than
disliked
it
was
a
particularly
of
a
domestic
nature
and
he
had
just
had
a
glimpse
into
lord
and
lady
winsleigh
married
life
which
to
him
was
decidedly
unpleasant
he
could
not
understand
how
lord
winsleigh
had
become
cognizant
of
all
he
had
so
frankly
stated
and
then
why
had
he
not
told
him
everything
at
first
without
waiting
to
declare
it
in
his
wife
presence
unless
indeed
he
wished
to
shame
her
there
was
evidently
something
in
the
man
disposition
and
character
that
he
philip
could
not
as
yet
comprehend
something
that
certainly
puzzled
him
and
filled
him
with
vague
uneasiness
winsleigh
i
awfully
sorry
this
has
happened
he
began
hurriedly
holding
out
his
hand
lord
winsleigh
grasped
it
cordially
my
dear
fellow
so
am
i
heartily
sorry
i
have
to
be
sorry
for
a
good
many
things
rather
often
but
specially
grieved
to
think
that
your
beautiful
and
innocent
young
wife
is
the
victim
in
this
case
unfortunately
i
was
told
nothing
till
this
morning
otherwise
i
might
possibly
have
prevented
all
your
unhappiness
but
i
trust
it
wo
be
of
long
duration
here
this
letter
he
returned
it
as
he
spoke
which
in
more
than
one
way
has
cost
so
large
a
price
possibly
her
ladyship
may
now
regret
her
purchase
pardon
me
said
errington
curiously
but
how
did
you
know
the
information
was
pressed
upon
me
very
much
replied
lord
winsleigh
evasively
and
from
such
a
source
that
up
to
the
last
moment
i
almost
refused
to
believe
it
he
paused
and
then
went
on
with
a
forced
smile
suppose
we
do
talk
any
more
about
it
errington
the
rather
painful
to
me
only
allow
me
to
ask
your
pardon
for
my
share
in
the
mischief
something
in
his
manner
of
speaking
affected
sir
philip
upon
my
soul
winsleigh
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
fervor
i
fancy
you
a
man
greatly
wronged
lord
winsleigh
smiled
slightly
you
only
he
said
quietly
well
my
good
friend
we
all
have
our
troubles
i
dare
say
mine
are
no
greater
than
those
of
many
better
men
he
stopped
short
then
asked
abruptly
i
suppose
you
see
lennox
errington
set
his
teeth
hard
i
shall
at
once
he
replied
and
i
shall
probably
thrash
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
that
right
i
sha
be
sorry
and
lord
winsleigh
hand
clenched
almost
unconsciously
i
hope
you
understand
errington
that
if
it
had
been
for
my
son
i
should
have
shot
that
fellow
long
ago
i
dare
say
you
wonder
and
some
others
too
why
i
have
done
it
but
ernest
poor
little
chap
he
would
have
heard
of
it
and
the
reason
of
it
his
young
life
is
involved
in
mine
why
should
i
bequeath
him
a
dishonored
mother
name
there
for
heaven
sake
do
let
me
make
a
fool
of
myself
and
he
fiercely
dashed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
a
duel
or
a
divorce
or
a
horsewhipping
they
all
come
to
pretty
much
the
same
thing
all
involve
public
scandal
for
the
name
of
the
woman
who
may
be
unhappily
concerned
and
scandal
clings
like
the
stain
on
lady
macbeth
hand
in
your
case
you
can
act
wife
is
above
a
shadow
of
suspicion
but
i
oh
my
god
how
much
women
have
to
answer
for
in
the
miseries
of
this
world
errington
said
nothing
pity
and
respect
for
the
man
before
him
held
him
silent
here
was
one
of
the
martyrs
of
modern
social
life
a
man
who
evidently
knew
himself
to
be
dishonored
by
his
wife
and
who
yet
for
the
sake
of
his
son
submitted
to
be
daily
broken
on
the
wheel
of
private
torture
rather
than
let
the
boy
grow
up
to
despise
and
slight
his
mother
whether
he
were
judged
as
wise
or
weak
in
his
behavior
there
was
surely
something
noble
about
him
something
unselfish
and
heroic
that
deserved
recognition
presently
lord
winsleigh
continued
in
calmer
tones
i
been
talking
too
much
about
myself
errington
i
fear
forgive
it
sometimes
i
thought
you
misunderstood
me
i
never
shall
again
declared
philip
earnestly
lord
winsleigh
met
his
look
of
sympathy
with
one
of
gratitude
thanks
he
said
briefly
and
with
this
they
shook
hands
again
heartily
and
parted
lord
winsleigh
saw
his
visitor
to
the
door
and
then
at
once
returned
to
his
wife
apartments
she
was
still
absent
from
the
boudoir
he
therefore
entered
her
without
ceremony
there
he
found
her
alone
kneeling
on
the
floor
her
head
buried
in
an
and
her
whole
frame
shaken
with
convulsive
sobs
he
looked
down
upon
her
with
a
strange
wistful
pain
in
his
eyes
pain
mingled
with
compassion
clara
he
said
gently
she
started
and
sprang
up
confronting
him
with
flushed
cheeks
and
wet
eyes
here
she
exclaimed
angrily
i
wonder
you
dare
to
she
broke
off
confused
by
his
keen
direct
glance
it
a
matter
for
wonder
he
said
quietly
it
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
that
i
your
husband
should
venture
to
intrude
myself
into
your
presence
nothing
could
be
more
out
of
the
common
but
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
something
which
must
be
said
sooner
or
later
and
i
may
as
well
speak
now
he
paused
she
was
silent
looking
at
him
in
a
sort
of
sudden
fear
sit
down
he
continued
in
the
same
even
tones
you
must
have
a
little
patience
with
me
i
endeavor
to
be
as
brief
as
possible
mechanically
she
obeyed
him
and
sank
into
a
low
fauteuil
she
began
playing
with
the
trinkets
on
her
silver
chatelaine
and
endeavored
to
feign
the
most
absolute
unconcern
but
her
heart
beat
quickly
she
could
not
imagine
what
was
coming
next
her
husband
manner
and
tone
were
quite
new
to
her
you
accused
me
just
now
he
went
on
of
being
a
spy
i
have
never
condescended
to
act
such
a
part
toward
you
clara
when
i
first
married
you
i
trusted
you
with
my
life
my
honor
and
my
name
and
though
you
have
betrayed
all
three
she
moved
restlessly
as
his
calm
gaze
remained
fixed
on
her
i
repeat
though
you
have
betrayed
all
three
i
have
deliberately
shut
my
eyes
to
the
ruin
of
my
hopes
in
a
loyal
endeavor
to
shield
you
from
the
world
calumny
regarding
the
unhappiness
you
have
caused
the
erringtons
your
own
maid
louise
rénaud
who
has
given
you
notice
of
her
intention
to
leave
you
told
me
all
she
knew
of
your
share
in
what
i
may
call
positive
cruelty
towards
a
happy
and
innocent
woman
who
has
never
injured
you
and
whose
friend
you
declared
yourself
to
be
you
believe
the
lies
of
a
servant
suddenly
cried
lady
winsleigh
wrathfully
have
not
believed
the
lies
of
sir
francis
lennox
who
is
less
honest
than
a
servant
asked
her
husband
his
grave
voice
deepening
with
a
thrill
of
passion
and
have
you
reported
them
everywhere
as
truths
but
as
regards
your
maid
i
doubted
her
story
altogether
she
assured
me
she
knew
what
money
you
took
out
with
you
yesterday
and
what
you
returned
with
and
as
the
only
place
you
visited
in
the
morning
was
the
brilliant
theatre
after
having
received
a
telegram
from
lennox
which
she
saw
it
was
easy
for
her
to
put
two
and
two
together
especially
as
she
noticed
you
reading
the
letter
you
had
purchased
moreover
he
paused
she
has
heard
certain
conversations
between
you
and
sir
francis
notably
one
that
took
place
at
the
in
the
summer
at
errington
manor
spy
you
say
your
detective
has
been
paid
by
you
fed
and
kept
about
your
own
person
to
minister
to
your
vanity
and
to
flatter
your
pride
that
she
has
turned
informer
against
you
is
not
surprising
be
thankful
that
her
information
has
fallen
into
no
more
malignant
hands
than
mine
again
he
paused
she
was
still
silent
but
her
lips
trembled
nervously
and
yet
i
was
loth
to
believe
everything
he
resumed
half
sadly
till
errington
came
and
showed
me
that
letter
and
told
me
the
whole
story
of
his
misery
even
then
i
thought
i
would
give
you
one
more
chance
why
i
brought
him
to
you
and
asked
you
the
question
before
him
one
look
at
your
face
told
me
you
were
guilty
though
you
denied
it
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
had
you
confessed
it
but
why
talk
about
it
any
longer
the
mischief
is
done
i
trust
it
is
not
irreparable
i
certainly
consider
that
before
troubling
that
poor
happiness
you
should
have
taken
the
precaution
to
inquire
a
little
further
into
the
truth
of
the
reports
you
heard
from
sir
francis
lennox
he
is
not
a
reliable
authority
on
any
question
whatsoever
you
may
have
thought
him
so
he
stopped
short
and
regarded
her
with
sorrowful
sternness
i
say
clara
you
may
have
thought
him
so
once
but
are
you
proud
to
have
shared
his
affections
with
violet
vere
she
uttered
a
sharp
cry
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
an
action
which
appeared
to
smite
her
husband
to
the
heart
for
his
voice
trembled
with
deep
feeling
when
he
next
spoke
ah
best
hide
it
clara
he
said
passionately
hide
that
fair
face
i
loved
so
well
hide
those
eyes
in
which
i
dreamed
of
finding
my
sunshine
clara
clara
what
can
i
say
to
you
fallen
rose
of
womanhood
how
can
i
he
suddenly
bent
over
her
as
though
to
caress
her
then
drew
back
with
a
quick
agonized
sigh
you
thought
me
blind
clara
he
went
on
in
low
tones
blind
to
my
own
dishonor
blind
to
your
faithlessness
i
tell
you
if
you
had
taken
my
heart
between
your
hands
and
wrung
the
blood
out
of
it
drop
by
drop
i
could
not
have
suffered
more
than
i
have
done
why
have
i
been
silent
so
long
no
matter
why
but
now
clara
this
life
of
ours
must
end
she
shuddered
away
from
him
end
it
then
she
muttered
in
a
choked
voice
you
can
do
as
you
like
you
can
divorce
me
yes
said
lord
winsleigh
musingly
i
can
divorce
you
there
will
be
no
defense
possible
as
you
know
if
witnesses
are
needed
they
are
to
be
had
in
the
persons
of
our
own
domestics
the
in
the
case
will
not
refute
the
charge
against
him
and
i
the
plaintiff
win
my
just
cause
do
you
realize
it
all
clara
you
the
leader
of
a
large
social
circle
you
the
proud
beauty
and
envied
lady
of
rank
and
fashion
you
will
be
made
a
subject
for
the
coarse
jests
of
lawyers
the
very
judge
on
the
bench
will
probably
play
off
his
stale
witticism
at
your
expense
your
dearest
friends
will
tear
your
name
to
shreds
the
newspapers
will
reek
of
your
doings
and
honest
housemaids
reading
of
your
fall
from
your
high
estate
will
thank
god
that
their
souls
and
bodies
are
more
chaste
than
yours
and
last
not
least
think
when
old
age
creeps
on
and
your
beauty
withers
think
of
your
son
grown
to
manhood
the
sole
heir
to
my
name
think
of
him
as
having
but
one
thing
to
blush
for
the
memory
of
his
dishonored
mother
cruel
cruel
she
cried
endeavoring
to
check
her
sobs
and
withdrawing
her
hands
from
her
face
why
do
you
say
such
things
to
me
why
did
you
marry
me
he
caught
her
hands
and
held
them
in
a
fast
grip
why
because
i
loved
you
clara
loved
you
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
strong
man
heart
when
i
first
saw
you
you
seemed
to
me
the
very
incarnation
of
maiden
purity
and
loveliness
the
days
of
our
courtship
the
first
few
months
of
our
marriage
what
they
were
to
you
i
know
not
to
me
they
were
supreme
happiness
when
our
boy
was
born
my
adoration
my
reverence
for
you
increased
you
were
so
sacred
in
my
eyes
that
i
could
have
knelt
and
asked
a
benediction
from
these
little
hands
here
he
gently
loosened
them
from
his
clasp
then
came
the
change
changed
you
i
can
not
imagine
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
unnatural
monstrous
incredible
there
was
no
falling
away
in
affection
that
i
can
swear
my
curse
upon
the
man
who
turned
your
heart
from
mine
so
rightful
and
deep
a
curse
is
it
that
i
feel
it
must
some
day
strike
home
he
paused
and
seemed
to
reflect
who
is
there
more
vile
more
traitorous
than
he
he
went
on
has
he
not
tried
to
influence
errington
wife
against
her
husband
for
what
base
purpose
but
clara
he
is
powerless
against
purity
and
innocence
what
in
the
name
of
god
gave
him
power
over
she
drooped
her
head
and
the
hot
blood
rushed
to
her
face
you
said
enough
she
murmured
sullenly
if
you
have
decided
on
a
divorce
pray
carry
out
your
intention
with
the
least
possible
delay
i
can
not
talk
any
more
i
i
am
tired
clara
said
her
husband
solemnly
with
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
i
would
rather
kill
you
than
divorce
you
there
was
something
so
terribly
earnest
in
his
tone
that
her
heart
beat
fast
with
fear
kill
me
kill
me
she
gasped
with
white
lips
yes
he
repeated
kill
you
as
a
frenchman
or
an
italian
would
and
take
the
consequences
yes
though
an
englishman
i
would
rather
do
this
than
drag
your
frail
poor
womanhood
through
the
mire
of
public
scandal
i
have
perhaps
a
strange
nature
but
such
as
i
am
i
am
there
are
too
many
of
our
families
already
flaunting
their
immorality
and
low
licentiousness
in
the
face
of
the
mocking
grinning
populace
i
for
one
could
never
make
up
my
mind
to
fling
the
honor
of
my
son
mother
to
them
as
though
it
were
a
bone
for
dogs
to
fight
over
no
i
have
another
proposition
to
make
to
you
he
stopped
short
she
stared
at
him
wonderingly
he
resumed
in
methodical
unmoved
tones
i
propose
clara
simply
to
leave
you
i
take
the
boy
and
absent
myself
from
this
country
so
as
to
give
you
perfect
freedom
and
save
you
all
trouble
there
be
no
possibility
of
scandal
for
i
will
keep
you
cognizant
of
my
movements
and
should
you
require
my
presence
at
any
time
for
the
sake
of
appearances
or
to
shield
you
from
calumny
you
may
rely
on
my
returning
to
you
at
once
without
delay
ernest
will
gain
many
advantages
by
travel
his
education
is
quite
a
sufficient
motive
for
my
departure
my
interest
in
his
young
life
being
well
known
to
all
our
circle
moreover
with
me
under
my
surveillance
he
need
never
know
anything
against
against
you
i
have
always
taught
him
to
honor
and
obey
you
in
his
heart
lord
winsleigh
paused
a
moment
then
went
on
somewhat
musingly
when
he
was
quite
little
he
used
to
wonder
why
you
did
love
him
it
was
hard
for
me
to
hear
him
say
that
sometimes
but
i
always
told
him
that
you
did
love
him
but
that
you
had
so
many
visits
to
makes
and
so
many
friends
to
entertain
that
you
had
no
time
to
play
with
him
i
think
he
quite
understood
but
still
i
did
my
best
he
was
silent
she
had
hidden
her
face
again
in
her
hands
and
he
heard
a
sound
of
smothered
sobbing
i
think
he
continued
calmly
that
he
has
a
great
reverence
for
you
in
his
young
heart
a
feeling
which
partakes
perhaps
more
of
fear
than
love
still
it
is
better
than
disdain
or
or
disrespect
i
shall
always
teach
him
to
esteem
you
highly
but
i
think
as
matters
stand
if
i
relieve
you
of
all
your
responsibilities
to
husband
and
son
you
clara
pray
do
distress
yourself
there
no
occasion
for
this
clara
for
on
a
sudden
impulse
she
had
flung
herself
at
his
feet
in
an
irrepressible
storm
of
passionate
weeping
kill
me
harry
she
sobbed
wildly
clinging
to
him
kill
me
speak
to
me
like
this
do
leave
me
oh
my
god
do
do
despise
me
so
utterly
hate
me
curse
me
strike
me
do
anything
but
leave
me
as
if
i
were
some
low
thing
unfit
for
your
touch
i
know
i
am
but
oh
harry
she
clung
to
him
more
closely
if
you
leave
me
i
will
not
live
i
can
not
have
you
no
pity
why
would
you
throw
me
back
alone
all
all
alone
to
die
of
your
contempt
and
my
shame
and
she
bowed
her
head
in
an
agony
of
tears
he
looked
down
upon
her
a
moment
in
silence
your
shame
he
murmured
my
wife
then
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
drew
her
with
a
strange
hesitation
of
touch
to
his
breast
as
though
she
were
some
sick
or
wounded
child
and
watched
her
as
she
lay
there
weeping
her
face
hidden
her
whole
frame
trembling
in
his
embrace
poor
soul
he
whispered
more
to
himself
than
to
her
poor
frail
woman
hush
hush
clara
the
past
is
past
i
make
you
no
more
reproaches
i
i
hurt
you
because
i
once
so
loved
you
but
now
now
what
there
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
leave
you
be
happier
so
you
have
perfect
liberty
you
need
even
think
of
me
unless
perhaps
as
one
dead
and
buried
long
ago
she
raised
herself
in
his
arms
and
looked
at
him
piteously
wo
you
give
me
a
chance
she
sobbed
not
one
if
i
had
but
known
you
better
if
i
had
understood
oh
i
been
vile
wicked
deceitful
but
i
not
happy
harry
i
never
been
happy
since
i
wronged
you
wo
you
give
me
one
little
hope
that
i
may
win
your
love
again
no
not
your
love
but
your
pity
oh
harry
have
i
lost
all
all
her
voice
broke
she
could
say
no
more
he
stroked
her
hair
gently
you
speak
on
impulse
just
now
clara
he
said
gravely
yet
tenderly
you
ca
know
your
own
strength
or
weakness
god
forbid
that
should
judge
you
harshly
as
you
wish
it
i
will
not
leave
you
yet
i
wait
whether
we
part
or
remain
together
shall
be
decided
by
your
own
actions
your
own
looks
your
own
words
you
understand
clara
you
know
my
feelings
i
content
for
the
present
to
place
my
fate
in
your
hands
he
smiled
rather
sadly
but
for
love
clara
i
fear
nothing
can
be
done
to
warm
to
life
this
poor
perished
love
of
ours
we
can
perhaps
take
hands
and
watch
its
corpse
patiently
together
and
say
how
sorry
we
are
it
is
dead
such
penitence
comes
always
too
late
he
sighed
and
put
her
gently
away
from
him
she
turned
up
her
flushed
face
to
his
will
you
kiss
me
harry
she
asked
tremblingly
he
met
her
eyes
and
an
exclamation
that
was
almost
a
groan
broke
from
his
lips
a
shudder
passed
through
his
frame
i
ca
clara
i
ca
god
forgive
me
not
yet
and
with
that
he
bowed
his
head
and
left
her
she
listened
to
the
echo
of
his
firm
footsteps
dying
away
and
creeping
guiltily
to
a
she
opened
it
and
watched
yearningly
his
retreating
figure
till
it
had
disappeared
why
did
i
never
love
him
till
now
she
murmured
sobbingly
now
when
he
despises
me
when
he
will
not
even
kiss
me
she
leaned
against
the
door
in
an
attitude
of
utter
dejection
not
caring
to
move
listening
intently
with
a
vague
hope
of
hearing
her
husband
returning
tread
a
lighter
step
than
his
however
came
suddenly
along
from
the
other
side
of
the
passage
and
startled
her
a
little
it
was
ernest
looking
the
picture
of
boyish
health
and
beauty
he
was
just
going
out
for
his
usual
ride
he
lifted
his
cap
with
a
pretty
courtesy
as
he
saw
her
and
said
mother
she
looked
at
him
with
new
interest
how
handsome
the
lad
was
how
fresh
his
face
how
joyously
clear
those
bright
blue
eyes
of
his
he
on
his
part
was
moved
by
a
novel
sensation
too
his
mother
his
proud
beautiful
careless
mother
had
been
crying
he
saw
that
at
a
glance
and
his
young
heart
beat
faster
when
she
laid
her
white
hand
sparkling
all
over
with
rings
on
his
arm
and
drew
him
closer
to
her
are
you
going
to
the
park
she
asked
gently
yes
then
recollecting
his
training
in
politeness
and
obedience
he
added
instantly
unless
you
want
me
she
smiled
faintly
i
never
do
want
you
do
i
ernest
she
asked
half
sadly
i
never
want
my
boy
at
all
her
voice
quivered
and
ernest
grew
more
and
more
astonished
if
you
do
i
stay
he
said
stoutly
filled
with
a
chivalrous
desire
to
console
his
so
suddenly
tender
mother
of
his
whatever
her
griefs
might
be
her
eyes
filled
again
but
she
tried
to
laugh
no
dear
not
now
run
along
and
enjoy
yourself
come
to
me
when
you
return
i
shall
be
at
home
all
day
and
stop
ernest
wo
you
kiss
me
the
boy
opened
his
eyes
wide
in
respectful
wonderment
and
his
cheeks
flushed
with
surprise
and
pleasure
why
mother
of
course
and
his
fresh
sweet
lips
closed
on
hers
with
frank
and
unaffected
heartiness
she
held
him
fast
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
him
earnestly
tell
your
father
you
kissed
me
will
you
she
said
do
forget
and
with
that
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
and
retreated
again
into
her
own
apartment
the
boy
went
on
his
way
somewhat
puzzled
and
bewildered
did
his
mother
love
him
after
all
if
so
he
thought
how
glad
he
was
how
very
glad
and
what
a
pity
he
had
not
known
it
before
chapter
xxix
i
heed
not
custom
creed
nor
law
i
care
for
nothing
that
ever
i
saw
i
terribly
laugh
with
an
oath
and
sneer
when
i
think
that
the
hour
of
death
draws
near
winter
errington
first
idea
on
leaving
winsleigh
house
was
to
seek
an
interview
with
sir
francis
lennox
and
demand
an
explanation
he
could
not
understand
the
man
motive
for
such
detestable
treachery
and
falsehood
his
anger
rose
to
a
white
heat
as
he
thought
of
it
and
he
determined
to
have
it
out
with
him
whatever
the
consequences
might
be
no
apology
will
serve
his
turn
he
muttered
the
scoundrel
he
has
lied
deliberately
and
by
jove
he
shall
pay
for
it
and
he
started
off
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
piccadilly
but
on
the
way
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
no
weapon
with
him
not
even
a
cane
wherewith
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
thrashing
sir
francis
and
calling
to
mind
a
certain
heavy
horsewhip
that
hung
over
the
in
his
own
room
he
hailed
a
hansom
and
was
driven
back
to
his
house
in
order
to
provide
himself
with
that
implement
of
castigation
before
proceeding
further
on
arriving
at
the
door
to
his
surprise
he
found
lorimer
who
was
just
about
to
ring
the
bell
why
i
thought
you
were
in
paris
he
exclaimed
i
came
back
last
night
george
began
when
morris
opened
the
door
and
errington
taking
his
friend
by
the
arm
hurried
him
into
the
house
in
five
minutes
he
had
unburdened
himself
of
all
his
troubles
and
had
explained
the
misunderstanding
about
violet
vere
and
thelma
consequent
flight
lorimer
listened
with
a
look
of
genuine
pain
and
distress
on
his
honest
face
phil
you
been
a
fool
he
said
candidly
a
positive
fool
if
you
pardon
me
for
saying
so
you
ought
to
have
told
thelma
everything
at
first
she
the
very
last
woman
in
the
world
who
ought
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
about
anything
neville
feelings
bother
feelings
depend
upon
it
the
poor
girl
has
heard
all
manner
of
stories
she
been
miserable
for
some
time
duprèz
noticed
it
and
he
related
in
a
few
words
the
little
scene
that
had
taken
place
at
errington
manor
on
the
night
of
the
when
his
playing
on
the
organ
had
moved
her
to
such
unwonted
emotion
philip
heard
him
in
moody
silence
how
had
it
happened
he
wondered
that
others
comparative
strangers
had
observed
that
thelma
looked
unhappy
while
he
her
husband
had
been
blind
to
it
he
could
not
make
this
out
and
yet
it
is
a
thing
that
very
commonly
happens
our
nearest
and
dearest
are
often
those
who
are
most
in
the
dark
respecting
our
private
and
personal
sufferings
we
do
not
wish
to
trouble
them
and
they
prefer
to
think
that
everything
is
right
with
us
even
though
the
rest
of
the
world
can
plainly
perceive
that
everything
is
wrong
to
the
last
moment
they
will
refuse
to
see
death
in
our
faces
though
the
veriest
stranger
meeting
us
casually
clearly
beholds
the
shadow
of
the
dark
angel
hand
of
lennox
went
on
lorimer
sympathetically
watching
his
friend
i
came
on
purpose
to
speak
to
you
about
him
i
got
some
news
for
you
he
a
regular
sneak
and
scoundrel
you
can
thrash
him
to
your
heart
content
for
he
has
grossly
insulted
your
wife
her
cried
errington
furiously
how
what
give
me
time
to
speak
and
george
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
his
arm
thelma
visited
my
mother
yesterday
and
told
her
that
on
the
night
before
when
you
had
gone
out
lennox
took
advantage
of
your
absence
to
come
here
and
make
love
to
her
and
she
actually
had
to
struggle
with
him
and
even
to
strike
him
in
order
to
release
herself
from
his
advances
my
mother
advised
her
to
tell
you
about
it
and
she
evidently
then
had
no
intention
of
flight
for
she
said
she
would
inform
you
of
everything
as
soon
as
you
returned
from
the
country
and
if
lady
winsleigh
had
interfered
it
very
probable
that
i
say
where
are
you
going
this
as
philip
made
a
bound
for
the
door
to
get
my
horsewhip
he
answered
all
right
i
approve
cried
lorimer
but
wait
one
instant
and
see
how
clear
the
plot
becomes
thelma
beauty
had
maddened
lennox
to
gain
her
good
opinion
as
he
thinks
he
throws
his
mistress
violet
vere
on
shoulders
your
ingenuous
visits
to
the
brilliant
theatre
gave
him
a
capital
pretext
for
this
and
as
for
lady
share
in
the
mischief
it
nothing
but
mere
feminine
spite
against
you
for
marrying
at
all
and
hatred
of
the
woman
whose
life
is
such
a
contrast
to
her
own
and
who
absorbs
all
your
affection
lennox
has
used
her
as
his
tool
and
the
vere
also
i
no
doubt
the
thing
as
clear
as
crystal
it
a
sort
of
general
misunderstanding
all
round
one
of
those
eminently
unpleasant
trifles
that
very
frequently
upset
the
peace
and
comfort
of
the
most
quiet
and
inoffensive
persons
but
the
fault
lies
with
dear
old
boy
with
exclaimed
philip
certainly
thelma
soul
is
as
open
as
daylight
you
should
have
had
any
secret
from
her
however
trifling
she
not
a
woman
guard
she
ca
take
life
as
the
most
of
us
do
in
military
fashion
with
ears
pricked
for
the
approach
of
a
spy
and
prepared
to
expect
betrayal
from
her
most
familiar
friends
she
accepts
things
as
they
appear
without
any
suspicion
of
mean
ulterior
designs
it
a
pity
of
course
it
a
pity
she
ca
be
and
scheme
and
plot
and
plan
and
lie
like
the
rest
of
us
however
course
is
plain
first
interview
lennox
and
then
follow
thelma
she
ca
have
left
hull
yet
there
are
scarcely
any
boats
running
to
norway
at
this
season
you
overtake
her
i
certain
by
jove
lorimer
said
errington
suddenly
clara
winsleigh
sticks
at
nothing
do
you
know
she
actually
had
the
impudence
to
suggest
that
you
of
all
people
were
in
love
with
thelma
lorimer
flushed
up
but
laughed
lightly
how
awfully
sweet
of
her
much
obliged
to
her
i
sure
and
how
did
you
take
it
phil
take
it
i
did
take
it
at
all
responded
philip
warmly
of
course
i
knew
it
was
only
her
spite
she
say
anything
in
one
of
her
tempers
lorimer
looked
at
him
with
a
sudden
tenderness
in
his
blue
eyes
then
he
laughed
again
a
little
forcedly
and
said
be
off
old
man
and
get
that
whip
of
yours
we
run
lennox
to
earth
hullo
here
britta
the
little
maid
entered
hurriedly
at
that
moment
she
came
to
ask
with
quivering
lips
whether
she
might
accompany
sir
philip
in
his
intended
journey
to
norway
for
if
you
do
not
find
the
fröken
at
hull
you
will
want
to
reach
the
altenfjord
said
britta
folding
hands
resolutely
in
front
of
her
apron
and
you
will
not
get
on
without
me
you
do
not
know
what
the
country
is
like
in
the
depth
of
winter
when
the
sun
is
asleep
you
must
have
the
reindeer
to
help
you
and
no
englishman
knows
how
to
drive
reindeer
and
and
here
britta
eyes
filled
you
have
not
thought
perhaps
that
the
journey
may
make
the
fröken
very
ill
and
that
when
we
find
her
she
may
be
dying
and
britta
strength
gave
way
in
a
big
sob
that
broke
from
the
depths
of
her
honest
affectionate
heart
do
talk
like
that
britta
cried
philip
passionately
i
ca
bear
it
of
course
you
shall
go
with
me
i
would
leave
you
behind
for
the
world
get
everything
ready
and
in
a
fever
of
heat
and
impatience
he
began
rummaging
among
some
books
on
a
till
he
found
the
he
sought
yes
here
we
are
there
a
train
leaving
for
hull
at
five
we
take
that
tell
morris
to
pack
my
portmanteau
and
you
bring
it
along
with
you
to
the
midland
this
afternoon
do
you
understand
britta
nodded
emphatically
and
hurried
off
at
once
to
busy
herself
with
these
preparations
while
philip
all
excitement
dashed
off
to
give
a
few
parting
injunctions
to
neville
and
to
get
his
horsewhip
lorimer
left
alone
for
a
few
minutes
seated
himself
in
an
easy
chair
and
began
absently
turning
over
the
newspapers
on
the
table
but
his
thoughts
were
far
away
and
presently
he
covered
his
eyes
with
one
hand
as
though
the
light
hurt
them
when
he
removed
it
his
lashes
were
wet
what
a
fool
i
am
he
muttered
impatiently
oh
thelma
thelma
my
darling
how
i
wish
i
could
follow
and
find
you
and
console
you
you
poor
tender
resigned
soul
going
away
like
this
because
you
thought
you
were
not
wanted
not
wanted
my
god
if
you
only
knew
how
one
man
at
least
has
wanted
and
yearned
for
you
ever
since
he
saw
your
sweet
face
why
ca
i
tear
you
out
of
my
heart
why
ca
i
love
some
one
else
ah
phil
good
generous
kind
old
phil
he
little
guesses
he
rose
and
paced
the
room
up
and
down
restlessly
the
fact
is
i
to
be
here
at
all
i
ought
to
leave
england
altogether
for
a
long
time
till
till
i
get
over
it
the
question
is
i
ever
get
over
it
sigurd
was
a
wise
boy
he
found
a
short
way
out
of
all
his
troubles
suppose
i
imitate
his
example
no
for
a
man
in
his
senses
that
would
be
rather
cowardly
though
it
might
be
pleasant
he
stopped
in
his
walk
with
a
pondering
expression
on
his
face
at
any
rate
i
wo
stop
here
to
see
her
come
back
i
could
trust
myself
i
should
say
something
foolish
i
know
i
should
i
take
my
mother
to
italy
she
wants
to
go
and
we
stay
with
lovelace
it
be
a
change
and
i
have
a
good
fight
with
myself
and
see
if
i
ca
come
off
the
conqueror
somehow
it
all
very
well
to
kill
an
opponent
in
battle
but
the
question
is
can
a
man
kill
his
inner
grumbling
discontented
selfish
self
if
he
ca
what
the
good
of
him
as
he
was
about
to
consider
this
point
reflectively
errington
entered
equipped
for
travelling
and
whip
in
hand
his
imagination
had
been
at
work
during
the
past
few
minutes
exaggerating
all
the
horrors
and
difficulties
of
thelma
journey
to
the
altenfjord
till
he
was
in
a
perfect
fever
of
irritable
excitement
come
on
lorimer
he
cried
there
no
time
to
lose
britta
knows
what
to
do
she
meet
me
at
the
station
i
ca
breathe
in
this
wretched
house
a
moment
longer
let
be
off
plunging
out
into
the
hall
he
bade
morris
summon
a
hansom
and
with
a
few
last
instructions
to
that
faithful
servitor
and
an
encouraging
kind
word
and
shake
of
the
hand
to
neville
who
with
a
face
of
remorseful
misery
stood
at
the
door
to
watch
his
departure
he
was
gone
the
hansom
containing
him
and
lorimer
rattled
rapidly
towards
the
abode
of
sir
francis
lennox
but
on
entering
piccadilly
the
vehicle
was
compelled
to
go
so
slowly
on
account
of
the
traffic
that
errington
who
every
moment
grew
more
and
more
impatient
could
not
stand
it
by
jove
this
is
like
a
walking
funeral
he
muttered
i
say
lorimer
let
get
out
we
can
do
the
rest
on
foot
they
stopped
the
cabman
and
paid
him
his
fare
then
hurried
along
rapidly
errington
every
now
and
then
giving
a
fiercer
clench
to
the
formidable
horsewhip
which
was
twisted
together
with
his
ordinary
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
attract
special
attention
coward
and
liar
he
muttered
as
he
thought
of
the
man
he
was
about
to
punish
he
shall
pay
for
his
dastardly
falsehood
by
jove
he
shall
it
be
a
precious
long
time
before
he
shows
himself
in
society
any
more
then
he
addressed
lorimer
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
shout
police
and
make
for
the
door
he
observed
you
keep
your
back
against
it
lorimer
i
do
care
how
many
fines
i
got
to
pay
as
long
as
i
can
thrash
him
soundly
all
right
lorimer
answered
and
they
quickened
their
pace
as
they
neared
the
chambers
which
sir
francis
lennox
rented
over
a
fashionable
jeweller
shop
they
became
aware
of
a
small
procession
coming
straight
towards
them
from
the
opposite
direction
was
being
carried
between
four
men
who
appeared
to
move
with
extreme
care
and
gentleness
this
something
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
boys
and
men
whose
faces
were
full
of
morbid
and
frightened
interest
the
whole
was
headed
by
a
couple
of
solemn
policemen
you
spoke
of
a
walking
funeral
just
now
said
lorimer
suddenly
this
looks
uncommonly
like
one
errington
made
no
reply
he
had
only
one
idea
in
his
mind
the
determination
to
chastise
and
thoroughly
disgrace
sir
francis
hound
him
out
of
the
clubs
he
thought
indignantly
his
own
set
shall
know
what
a
liar
he
is
and
if
i
can
help
it
he
shall
never
hold
up
his
head
again
entirely
occupied
as
he
was
with
these
reflections
he
paid
no
heed
to
anything
that
was
going
on
in
the
street
and
he
scarcely
heard
lorimer
last
observation
so
that
he
was
utterly
surprised
and
taken
aback
when
he
with
lorimer
was
compelled
to
come
to
a
halt
before
the
very
door
of
the
jeweller
lennox
landlord
while
the
two
policemen
cleared
a
passage
through
the
crowd
saying
in
low
tones
stand
aside
gentlemen
please
stand
aside
thus
making
gradual
way
for
four
bearers
who
as
was
now
plainly
to
be
seen
carried
a
common
wooden
stretcher
covered
with
a
cloth
under
which
lay
what
seemed
from
its
outline
to
be
a
human
figure
what
the
matter
here
asked
lorimer
with
a
curious
cold
thrill
running
through
him
as
he
put
the
simple
question
one
of
the
policemen
answered
readily
enough
an
accident
sir
gentleman
badly
hurt
down
at
charing
cross
station
tried
to
jump
into
a
train
when
it
had
started
foot
caught
was
thrown
under
the
wheels
and
dragged
along
some
distance
doctor
says
he
ca
live
sir
who
is
he
what
his
name
lennox
sir
leastways
that
the
name
on
his
card
and
this
is
the
address
sir
francis
lennox
i
believe
it
is
errington
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
of
horror
at
that
moment
the
jeweller
came
out
of
the
recesses
of
his
shop
with
uplifted
hands
and
bewildered
countenance
an
accident
good
heavens
sir
francis
take
him
here
he
addressed
the
bearers
you
should
have
gone
round
to
the
private
entrance
he
must
be
seen
in
the
shop
frightening
away
all
my
customers
here
pass
through
pass
through
as
quick
as
you
can
and
they
did
pass
through
carrying
their
crushed
burden
tenderly
along
by
the
shining
glass
cases
and
polished
counters
where
glimmered
and
flashed
jewels
of
every
size
and
lustre
for
the
adorning
of
the
children
of
this
world
slowly
and
carefully
step
by
step
they
reached
the
upper
floor
and
there
in
a
luxurious
apartment
furnished
with
almost
feminine
elegance
they
lifted
the
inanimate
form
from
the
stretcher
and
laid
it
down
still
shrouded
on
a
velvet
sofa
removing
the
last
number
of
and
two
of
zola
novels
to
make
room
for
the
heavy
unconscious
head
errington
and
lorimer
stood
at
the
doorway
completely
overcome
by
the
suddenness
of
the
event
they
had
followed
the
bearers
almost
mechanically
exchanging
no
word
or
glance
by
the
way
and
now
they
watched
in
almost
breathless
suspense
while
a
surgeon
who
was
present
gently
turned
back
the
cover
that
hid
the
injured
man
features
and
exposed
them
to
full
view
was
sir
francis
that
mangled
creature
the
lascivious
dandy
the
disciple
of
and
errington
shuddered
and
averted
his
gaze
from
that
hideous
face
so
horribly
contorted
yet
otherwise
deathlike
in
its
rigid
stillness
there
was
a
grave
hush
the
surgeon
still
bent
over
him
touching
here
probing
there
with
tenderness
and
skill
but
finally
he
drew
back
with
a
hopeless
shake
of
his
head
nothing
can
be
done
he
whispered
absolutely
nothing
at
that
moment
sir
francis
stirred
he
groaned
and
opened
his
eyes
what
terrible
eyes
they
were
filled
with
that
look
of
intense
anguish
and
something
worse
than
anguish
fear
frantic
fear
coward
fear
fear
that
was
almost
more
overpowering
than
his
bodily
suffering
he
stared
wildly
at
the
little
group
assembled
strange
faces
so
far
as
he
could
make
them
out
that
regarded
him
with
evident
compassion
what
what
was
all
this
what
did
it
mean
death
no
no
he
thought
madly
while
his
brain
reeled
with
the
idea
death
what
death
darkness
annihilation
blackness
all
that
was
horrible
unimaginable
god
he
would
die
god
who
god
no
matter
he
would
live
he
would
struggle
against
this
heaviness
this
coldness
this
pillar
of
ice
in
which
he
was
being
slowly
frozen
frozen
frozen
inch
by
inch
he
made
a
furious
effort
to
move
and
uttered
a
scream
of
agony
stabbed
through
and
through
by
torturing
pain
keep
still
said
the
surgeon
pityingly
sir
francis
heard
him
not
he
wrestled
with
his
bodily
anguish
till
the
perspiration
stood
in
large
drops
on
his
forehead
he
raised
himself
gasping
for
breath
and
glared
about
him
like
a
trapped
beast
of
prey
give
me
brandy
he
muttered
chokingly
quick
quick
are
you
going
to
let
me
die
like
a
dog
damn
you
all
the
effort
to
move
to
speak
exhausted
his
sinking
strength
his
throat
rattled
he
clenched
his
fists
and
made
as
though
he
would
spring
off
his
couch
when
a
fearful
contortion
convulsed
his
whole
body
his
eyes
rolled
up
and
became
fixed
he
fell
heavily
back
quietly
the
surgeon
covered
again
what
was
now
nothing
nothing
but
a
mutilated
corpse
it
all
over
he
announce
briefly
errington
heard
these
words
in
sickened
silence
all
over
was
it
possible
so
soon
all
over
and
he
had
come
too
late
to
punish
the
ravisher
of
his
wife
honor
too
late
he
still
held
the
whip
in
his
hand
with
which
he
had
meant
to
chastise
that
that
distorted
mangled
lump
of
clay
yonder
pah
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
and
he
turned
away
faint
and
dizzy
he
felt
rather
than
saw
the
staircase
down
which
he
dreamily
went
followed
by
lorimer
the
two
policemen
were
in
the
hall
scribbling
the
particulars
of
the
accident
in
their
which
having
done
they
marched
off
attended
by
a
wandering
who
was
anxious
to
write
a
successful
account
of
the
shocking
fatality
as
it
was
called
in
the
next
day
newspapers
then
the
bearers
departed
cheerfully
carrying
with
them
the
empty
stretcher
then
the
jeweller
who
seemed
quite
unmoved
respecting
the
sudden
death
of
his
lodger
chatted
amicably
with
the
surgeon
about
the
reputation
and
various
demerits
of
the
deceased
and
errington
and
lorimer
as
they
passed
through
the
shop
heard
him
speaking
of
a
person
hitherto
unheard
of
namely
lady
francis
lennox
who
had
been
deserted
by
her
husband
for
the
past
six
years
and
who
was
living
uncomplainingly
the
life
of
an
in
germany
with
her
married
sister
maintaining
by
the
work
of
her
own
hands
her
one
little
child
a
boy
of
five
he
never
allowed
her
a
farthing
said
the
conversational
jeweller
and
she
never
asked
him
for
one
wiggins
his
lawyer
firm
of
wiggins
whizzer
furnival
inn
told
me
all
about
his
affairs
oh
yes
he
was
a
regular
masher
not
worth
much
i
should
say
he
must
have
spent
over
a
thousand
a
year
in
keeping
up
that
little
place
at
john
wood
for
violet
vere
he
owes
me
five
hundred
however
wiggins
will
see
everything
fair
i
no
doubt
i
just
wired
to
him
announcing
the
death
i
do
suppose
any
one
will
regret
him
except
perhaps
the
woman
at
john
wood
but
i
believe
playing
for
a
bigger
stake
just
now
and
stimulated
by
this
thought
he
drew
out
from
a
handsome
morocco
case
a
superb
pendant
of
emeralds
and
diamonds
a
work
of
art
that
glittered
as
he
displayed
it
like
a
star
on
a
frosty
night
pretty
thing
is
it
he
said
proudly
eight
hundred
pounds
and
cheap
too
it
was
ordered
for
miss
vere
two
months
ago
by
the
duke
of
moorlands
i
see
he
sold
his
collection
of
pictures
the
other
day
luckily
they
fetched
a
tidy
sum
so
i
pretty
sure
of
the
money
for
this
he
sell
everything
he
got
to
please
her
queer
oh
not
at
all
she
the
rage
just
now
i
ca
see
anything
in
her
myself
but
i
not
a
duke
you
see
i
obliged
to
be
respectable
he
laughed
as
he
returned
the
pendant
to
its
nest
of
padded
amber
satin
and
errington
sick
at
heart
to
hear
such
frivolous
converse
going
on
while
that
crushed
and
lifeless
form
lay
in
the
very
room
above
unwatched
put
his
arm
through
lorimer
and
left
the
shop
once
in
the
open
street
with
the
keen
cold
air
blowing
against
their
faces
they
looked
at
each
other
blankly
piccadilly
was
crowded
the
hurrying
people
passed
and
there
were
the
shouts
of
omnibus
conductors
and
newsboys
the
laughter
of
young
men
coming
out
of
the
james
hall
restaurant
all
was
as
usual
as
indeed
why
should
it
not
what
matters
the
death
of
one
man
in
a
million
unless
indeed
it
be
a
man
whose
life
like
a
torch
uplifted
in
darkness
has
enlightened
and
cheered
the
world
but
the
death
of
a
mere
fashionable
swell
whose
chief
talent
has
been
a
trick
of
lying
gracefully
who
cares
for
such
a
one
society
is
instinctively
relieved
to
hear
that
his
place
is
empty
and
shall
know
him
more
but
errington
could
not
immediately
forget
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
he
was
overcome
by
sensations
of
horror
even
of
pity
and
he
walked
by
his
friend
side
for
some
time
in
silence
i
wish
i
could
get
rid
of
this
thing
he
said
suddenly
looking
down
at
the
horsewhip
in
his
hand
lorimer
made
no
answer
he
understood
his
feeling
and
realized
the
situation
as
sufficiently
grim
to
be
armed
with
a
weapon
meant
for
the
chastisement
of
a
man
whom
death
had
so
suddenly
claimed
was
to
say
the
least
of
it
unpleasant
yet
the
horsewhip
could
scarcely
be
thrown
away
in
piccadilly
such
an
action
might
attract
notice
and
comment
presently
philip
spoke
again
he
was
actually
married
all
the
time
so
it
seems
and
lorimer
face
expressed
something
very
like
contempt
by
jove
phil
he
must
have
been
an
awful
scoundrel
do
let
say
any
more
about
him
he
dead
and
philip
quickened
his
steps
and
what
a
horrible
death
horrible
enough
indeed
again
they
were
both
silent
mechanically
they
turned
down
towards
pall
mall
george
said
errington
with
a
strange
awe
in
his
tones
it
seems
to
me
as
if
there
were
death
in
the
air
i
do
believe
in
presentiments
but
yet
yet
i
can
not
help
thinking
what
if
i
should
find
my
thelma
lorimer
turned
very
pale
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
him
but
he
endeavored
to
smile
for
god
sake
old
fellow
do
think
of
anything
so
terrible
look
here
you
hipped
no
wonder
and
you
got
a
long
journey
before
you
come
and
have
lunch
it
just
two
afterwards
we
go
to
the
garrick
and
have
a
chat
with
beau
lovelace
he
a
fellow
for
looking
on
the
bright
side
of
everything
then
i
see
you
off
this
afternoon
at
the
midland
what
do
you
say
errington
assented
to
this
arrangement
and
tried
to
shake
off
the
depression
that
had
settled
upon
him
though
dark
forebodings
passed
one
after
the
other
like
clouds
across
his
mind
he
seemed
to
see
the
altenguard
hills
stretching
drearily
white
with
frozen
snow
around
the
black
fjord
he
pictured
thelma
fancying
herself
deserted
returning
through
the
cold
and
darkness
to
the
lonely
behind
the
now
withered
pines
then
he
began
to
think
of
the
where
that
other
thelma
lay
hidden
in
her
last
deep
sleep
the
wailing
words
of
sigurd
came
freshly
back
to
his
ears
when
the
poor
crazed
lad
had
likened
thelma
thoughts
to
his
favorite
flowers
the
pansies
one
by
one
you
will
gather
and
play
with
her
thoughts
as
though
they
were
these
blossoms
your
burning
hand
will
mar
their
color
they
will
wither
and
furl
up
and
die
and
you
what
will
you
care
nothing
no
man
ever
cares
for
a
flower
that
is
withered
not
even
though
his
own
hand
slew
it
had
he
been
to
blame
he
mused
with
a
sorrowful
weight
at
his
heart
unintentionally
had
he
yes
he
would
put
it
plainly
had
he
neglected
her
just
a
little
had
he
not
with
all
his
true
and
passionate
love
for
her
taken
her
beauty
her
devotion
her
obedience
too
much
for
granted
too
much
as
his
right
and
in
these
latter
months
when
her
health
had
made
her
weaker
and
more
in
need
of
his
tenderness
had
he
not
in
a
sudden
desire
for
political
fame
and
worldly
honor
left
her
too
much
alone
a
prey
to
solitude
and
the
often
morbid
musings
which
solitude
engenders
he
began
to
blame
himself
heartily
for
the
misunderstanding
that
had
arisen
out
of
his
share
in
neville
unhappy
secret
neville
had
been
weak
and
timid
he
had
shrunk
nervously
from
avowing
that
the
notorious
violet
vere
was
actually
the
woman
he
had
so
faithfully
loved
and
mourned
but
he
philip
ought
not
to
have
humored
him
in
these
fastidious
scruples
he
ought
to
have
confided
everything
to
thelma
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
once
or
twice
been
uneasy
lest
rumors
of
his
frequent
visits
to
miss
vere
might
possibly
reach
his
wife
ears
but
then
as
his
purpose
was
absolutely
disinterested
and
harmless
he
did
not
dwell
on
this
idea
but
dismissed
it
and
held
his
peace
for
neville
sake
contenting
himself
with
the
thought
that
if
thelma
hear
anything
she
would
never
believe
a
word
against
me
he
could
not
quite
see
where
his
fault
had
been
though
a
fault
there
was
somewhere
as
he
uneasily
felt
and
he
would
no
doubt
have
started
indignantly
had
a
small
elf
whispered
in
his
ear
the
word
yet
that
was
the
name
of
his
failing
that
and
no
other
how
many
men
otherwise
are
seriously
though
often
unconsciously
burdened
with
this
large
parcel
of
nothing
sir
philip
did
not
appear
to
be
conceited
he
would
have
repelled
the
accusation
with
astonishment
not
knowing
that
in
his
very
denial
of
the
fault
the
fault
existed
he
had
never
been
truly
humbled
but
twice
in
his
life
once
as
he
knelt
to
receive
his
mother
dying
benediction
and
again
when
he
first
loved
thelma
and
was
uncertain
whether
his
love
could
be
returned
by
so
fair
and
pure
a
creature
with
these
two
exceptions
all
his
experience
had
tended
to
give
him
an
excellent
opinion
of
himself
and
that
he
should
possess
one
of
the
best
and
loveliest
wives
in
the
world
seemed
to
him
quite
in
keeping
with
the
usual
course
of
things
the
feeling
that
it
was
a
sheer
impossibility
for
her
to
ever
believe
a
word
against
him
rose
out
of
this
inward
this
one
flaw
in
his
otherwise
bright
honest
and
lovable
character
a
flaw
of
which
he
himself
was
not
aware
now
when
for
the
third
time
his
fairy
castle
of
perfect
peace
and
pleasure
seemed
shaken
to
its
foundations
when
he
again
realized
the
uncertainty
of
life
or
death
he
felt
bewildered
and
wretched
his
chiefest
pride
was
centred
in
thelma
and
she
was
gone
again
he
reverted
to
the
miserable
idea
that
like
a
melancholy
refrain
haunted
him
what
if
i
should
find
her
absorbed
in
painful
reflections
he
was
a
very
silent
companion
for
lorimer
during
the
luncheon
which
they
took
at
a
quiet
little
restaurant
well
known
to
the
of
pall
mall
and
regent
street
lorimer
himself
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
equally
depressed
and
anxious
for
did
he
not
love
thelma
as
much
as
even
her
husband
could
nay
perhaps
more
knowing
his
love
was
hopeless
not
always
does
possession
of
the
adored
object
strengthen
the
adoration
the
rapturous
dreams
of
an
ideal
passion
have
often
been
known
to
surpass
reality
a
thousandfold
so
the
two
friends
exchanged
but
few
words
though
they
tried
to
converse
cheerfully
on
indifferent
subjects
and
failed
in
the
attempt
they
had
nearly
finished
their
light
repast
when
a
familiar
voice
saluted
them
it
errington
i
thocht
i
couldna
be
mistaken
how
are
ye
both
sandy
macfarlane
stood
before
them
unaltered
save
that
his
scanty
beard
had
grown
somewhat
longer
they
had
seen
nothing
of
him
since
their
trip
to
norway
and
they
greeted
him
now
with
unaffected
heartiness
glad
of
the
distraction
his
appearance
afforded
them
where
do
you
hail
from
mac
asked
lorimer
as
he
made
the
sit
down
at
their
table
we
have
heard
of
you
for
an
age
it
a
goodish
bit
of
time
assented
macfarlane
but
better
late
than
never
i
came
up
to
london
a
week
ago
from
glasgie
and
my
heed
has
been
in
a
whirl
ever
since
eh
mon
but
it
an
awful
place
maybe
i
get
used
after
a
wee
whilie
are
you
going
to
settle
here
then
inquired
errington
i
thought
you
intended
to
be
a
minister
somewhere
in
scotland
macfarlane
smiled
and
his
eyes
twinkled
i
hae
altered
ma
a
bit
he
said
ye
see
ma
aunt
in
glasgie
deed
i
understand
laughed
lorimer
you
come
in
for
the
old
money
puir
body
and
sandy
shook
his
head
gravely
a
few
hours
before
she
died
she
tore
up
her
will
in
a
screamin
fury
o
christian
charity
and
forethought
meanin
to
mak
anither
in
favor
o
leavin
a
her
trash
to
the
fund
for
distributin
bible
knowledge
among
the
heathen
but
she
never
had
time
to
fulfill
her
intention
she
went
off
like
a
lamb
and
there
being
no
will
her
money
fell
to
me
as
the
nearest
survivin
relative
eh
the
puir
thing
if
her
spirit
is
anywhere
aboot
she
must
be
in
a
sair
plight
to
think
i
got
it
after
a
her
curses
how
much
asked
lorimer
amused
oh
just
a
fair
seventy
thousand
or
so
answered
macfarlane
carelessly
well
done
mac
said
errington
with
a
smile
endeavoring
to
appear
interested
you
quite
rich
then
i
congratulate
you
riches
are
a
snare
observed
macfarlane
sententiously
a
snare
and
a
decoy
to
both
soul
and
body
he
laughed
and
rubbed
his
hands
then
added
with
some
eagerness
i
say
how
is
lady
errington
she
very
well
answered
sir
philip
hurriedly
exchanging
a
quick
look
with
lorimer
which
the
latter
at
once
understood
she
away
on
a
visit
just
now
i
going
to
join
her
this
afternoon
i
sorry
she
away
said
sandy
and
he
looked
very
disappointed
but
i
see
her
when
she
comes
back
will
she
be
long
absent
no
not
long
a
few
days
only
and
as
errington
said
this
an
involuntary
sigh
escaped
him
a
few
days
only
god
grant
it
but
what
what
if
he
should
find
her
macfarlane
noticed
the
sadness
of
his
expression
but
prudently
forbore
to
make
any
remark
upon
it
he
contented
himself
with
saying
weel
ye
got
a
wife
worth
having
as
i
dare
say
ye
know
i
shall
be
glad
to
pay
my
respects
to
her
as
soon
as
she
returns
i
got
your
address
errington
will
ye
take
mine
and
he
handed
him
a
small
card
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
the
number
of
a
house
in
one
of
the
lowest
streets
in
the
of
london
philip
glanced
at
it
with
some
surprise
is
where
you
live
he
asked
with
emphatic
amazement
yes
it
just
the
cleanest
tenement
i
could
find
in
that
neighborhood
and
the
woman
that
keeps
it
is
fairly
respectable
but
with
your
money
remonstrated
lorimer
who
also
looked
at
the
card
i
rather
wonder
at
your
choice
of
abode
why
my
dear
fellow
do
you
what
sort
of
a
place
it
is
a
steadfast
earnest
look
came
into
macfarlane
grey
eyes
yes
i
do
know
pairfectly
he
said
in
answer
to
the
question
it
a
place
where
there
misery
starvation
and
crime
of
all
sorts
and
there
i
am
in
the
very
midst
of
it
just
where
i
want
to
be
ye
see
i
was
meant
to
be
a
meenister
one
of
those
douce
cannie
comfortable
bodies
that
drone
in
the
pulpit
about
predestination
and
original
sin
and
so
forth
a
sort
of
palaver
that
does
no
good
to
ony
resonable
creature
an
if
i
had
followed
out
this
profession
i
make
nae
doot
that
with
my
aunt
seventy
thousand
i
should
be
a
vera
comfortable
respectable
selfish
type
of
a
man
who
was
decently
embarked
in
an
apparently
important
but
really
useless
career
useless
interrupted
lorimer
archly
i
say
mac
take
care
a
minister
of
the
lord
i
thinkin
there
are
unco
few
o
the
lord
in
this
warld
said
macfarlane
musingly
maist
o
them
to
themselves
care
na
a
wheen
mair
for
christ
than
buddha
i
tell
ye
i
was
an
altered
man
after
we
been
to
norway
the
auld
pagan
set
me
thinkin
mony
mony
a
time
for
ma
certes
he
better
worthy
respect
than
mony
a
christian
and
as
for
his
daughter
the
twa
great
blue
eyes
o
that
lassie
made
me
fair
ashamed
o
mysel
why
because
i
felt
that
as
a
o
the
established
kirk
i
was
bound
to
be
a
sort
ony
thinkin
reasonable
man
wi
a
conscience
canna
be
otherwise
wi
they
folk
and
ye
ken
errington
there
something
in
your
wife
look
that
maks
a
body
hesitate
before
tellin
a
lee
weel
what
wi
her
face
an
the
auld
talk
i
reflectit
that
i
couldna
be
a
as
go
an
that
i
must
follow
oot
the
testament
teachings
according
to
ma
own
way
of
thinkin
first
i
fancied
i
rough
it
abroad
as
a
meesionary
then
i
remembered
the
savages
at
hame
an
decided
to
attend
to
them
before
onything
else
then
my
aunt
siller
came
in
handy
in
short
i
just
gaun
to
live
on
as
wee
a
handfu
o
the
filthy
lucre
as
i
can
an
lay
oot
the
rest
on
the
heathens
o
london
an
it
as
well
to
while
i
alive
to
see
mysel
for
i
often
observed
that
if
ye
leave
your
warld
gear
to
the
poor
when
ye
deed
just
for
the
gude
reason
that
ye
canna
tak
it
to
the
grave
wi
ye
it
melt
in
a
wonderfu
way
through
the
hands
o
the
an
o
the
fund
till
naething
left
for
those
ye
meant
to
benefit
ye
maunna
think
i
gaun
to
do
ony
preachin
business
down
at
there
too
much
o
that
an
already
the
puir
soul
whose
wee
hoosie
i
rented
hadna
tasted
bit
nor
sup
for
three
days
till
i
came
an
startled
her
into
a
greetin
fit
by
takin
her
rooms
an
payin
her
in
advance
eh
mon
ye
have
thought
i
was
a
saint
frae
heaven
if
ye
heard
her
blessin
me
an
a
gude
curate
had
called
on
her
just
before
and
had
given
her
a
tract
to
dine
on
ye
see
i
maun
mak
mysel
a
to
the
folk
first
before
i
can
do
them
gude
i
maun
get
to
the
heart
their
troubles
an
troubles
are
plentiful
in
that
quarter
i
maun
live
among
them
an
be
ane
o
them
i
wad
mind
ye
that
christ
himsel
gave
sympathy
to
begin
with
he
did
the
preachin
afterwards
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
mac
said
errington
suddenly
seeing
his
raw
scotch
friend
with
the
perverse
accent
in
quite
a
new
and
heroic
light
macfarlane
actually
blushed
nonsense
not
a
bit
he
declared
quite
nervously
it
just
pure
selfishness
after
a
for
i
simply
enjoyin
mysel
the
hale
day
long
last
nicht
i
found
a
wee
cripple
a
laddie
sittin
by
himsel
in
the
gutter
munchin
a
potato
skin
i
just
took
him
he
starin
an
blinkin
like
an
owl
at
me
and
carried
him
into
my
room
there
i
gave
him
a
plate
o
barley
broth
an
finished
him
up
wi
a
hunk
o
gingerbread
ma
certes
ye
should
ha
seen
the
rascal
laugh
was
better
than
lookin
at
a
play
from
a
box
on
the
grand
tier
by
jove
sandy
you
a
brick
cried
lorimer
laughing
to
hide
a
very
different
emotion
i
had
no
idea
you
were
that
sort
of
chap
nor
had
i
said
macfarlane
quite
simply
i
never
fashed
mysel
thinkin
o
ither
folks
troubles
at
a
i
never
even
took
into
conseederation
the
meanin
o
the
testament
teachings
till
i
saw
your
leddy
wife
errington
he
paused
a
moment
then
added
gravely
yes
and
i
aften
fancied
she
maun
be
a
real
live
angel
an
i
sought
always
to
turn
my
hand
to
something
useful
and
worth
the
doin
ever
since
i
met
her
i
tell
her
so
said
poor
philip
his
heart
aching
for
his
lost
love
as
he
spoke
though
he
smiled
it
will
give
her
pleasure
to
hear
it
macfarlane
blushed
again
like
any
awkward
schoolboy
oh
i
dinna
ken
aboot
that
he
said
hurriedly
she
just
a
grand
woman
anyway
then
bethinking
himself
of
another
subject
he
asked
have
you
heard
o
the
reverend
dyceworthy
lately
errington
and
lorimer
replied
in
the
negative
macfarlane
laughed
his
eyes
twinkled
it
evident
ye
never
read
police
reports
he
said
talk
o
misters
he
a
pretty
specimen
he
been
hunted
out
o
his
place
in
yorkshire
for
carryin
on
wi
the
women
o
his
congregation
one
day
he
locked
himsel
in
the
vestry
wi
the
wife
o
one
o
his
preencipal
supporters
an
he
had
a
grand
time
of
it
till
the
husband
came
dragged
him
oot
an
thrashed
him
soundly
then
he
left
the
neighborhood
an
just
th
ither
day
he
turned
up
in
glasgie
macfarlane
paused
and
laughed
again
well
said
lorimer
with
some
interest
did
you
meet
him
there
that
did
i
but
no
to
speak
to
him
he
was
for
too
weel
lookit
after
to
need
my
services
and
macfarlane
rubbed
his
great
hands
together
with
an
irrepressible
chuckle
there
was
a
crowd
o
hootin
laddies
round
him
an
he
was
callin
on
the
heavens
to
bear
witness
to
his
purity
his
hat
was
off
an
he
had
a
black
eye
an
a
his
coat
was
covered
mud
an
a
policeman
was
embracin
him
vera
affectionately
by
th
arm
he
was
in
charge
for
drunken
disorderly
an
indecent
conduct
an
the
magistrate
cam
down
pretty
hard
on
him
the
case
proved
to
be
exceptionally
outrageous
so
he
sentenced
to
a
month
imprisonment
an
hard
labor
hard
labor
eh
mon
but
that
fine
fancy
him
at
work
at
real
work
for
the
first
time
in
a
his
days
gude
lord
i
can
see
him
at
it
so
he
come
to
that
and
errington
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
weary
contempt
i
thought
he
would
his
career
as
a
minister
is
ended
one
comfort
do
be
too
sure
o
that
said
sandy
cautiously
there
always
america
ye
ken
he
can
mak
a
holy
martyr
o
himsel
there
he
may
gain
as
muckle
a
reputation
as
henry
ward
beecher
ye
canna
ever
tell
what
may
happen
is
a
queer
warld
queer
indeed
assented
lorimer
as
they
all
rose
and
left
the
restaurant
together
if
our
present
existence
is
the
result
of
a
fortuitous
conglomeration
of
atoms
i
think
the
atoms
ought
to
have
been
more
careful
what
they
were
about
that
all
i
can
say
they
reached
the
open
street
where
macfarlane
shook
hands
and
went
his
way
promising
to
call
on
errington
as
soon
as
thelma
should
be
again
at
home
he
turned
out
quite
a
fine
fellow
said
lorimer
when
he
had
gone
i
should
never
have
thought
he
had
so
much
in
him
he
has
become
a
philanthropist
i
fancy
he
better
than
an
ordinary
philanthropist
replied
philip
philanthropists
often
talk
a
great
deal
and
do
nothing
like
members
of
parliament
suggested
lorimer
with
a
smile
exactly
so
i
resigned
my
candidateship
resigned
why
oh
i
sick
of
the
thing
one
has
to
be
such
a
humbug
to
secure
votes
i
had
a
wretched
time
yesterday
speechifying
and
trying
to
rouse
up
clodhoppers
to
the
interests
of
their
country
and
all
the
time
my
darling
at
home
was
alone
and
breaking
her
heart
about
me
by
jove
if
i
only
known
when
i
came
back
this
morning
to
all
this
misery
i
told
neville
to
send
in
my
resignation
i
repeated
the
same
thing
to
him
the
last
thing
before
i
left
the
house
but
you
might
have
waited
a
day
or
two
said
lorimer
wonderingly
you
such
a
fellow
of
impulse
phil
well
i
ca
help
it
i
tired
of
politics
i
began
with
a
will
fancying
that
every
member
of
the
house
had
his
country
interests
at
heart
not
a
bit
of
it
they
all
for
themselves
most
of
them
at
any
rate
they
not
even
sincere
in
their
efforts
to
do
good
to
the
population
and
it
all
very
well
to
stick
up
for
the
aristocracy
but
why
in
heaven
name
ca
some
of
the
wealthiest
among
them
do
as
much
as
our
old
mac
is
doing
for
the
outcast
and
miserable
poor
i
see
some
real
usefulness
and
good
in
work
and
i
help
him
in
it
with
a
will
when
when
thelma
comes
back
thus
talking
the
two
friends
reached
the
garrick
club
where
they
found
beau
lovelace
in
the
turning
over
some
new
books
with
the
curious
smiling
air
of
one
who
believes
there
can
be
nothing
original
under
the
sun
and
that
all
literature
is
mere
repetition
he
greeted
them
cheerfully
come
out
of
here
he
said
come
into
a
place
where
we
can
talk
there
an
old
fellow
over
there
who
ready
to
murder
any
member
who
even
whispers
we
wo
excite
his
angry
passions
you
know
we
all
here
we
each
got
our
own
little
particular
stall
where
we
sort
our
goods
our
mouldy
oranges
sour
apples
and
indigestible
nuts
and
we
polish
them
up
to
look
tempting
to
the
public
it
a
great
business
and
we
ca
bear
to
be
looked
at
while
we
turning
our
apples
with
the
best
side
outwards
and
boiling
our
oranges
to
make
them
swell
and
seem
big
we
like
to
do
our
humbug
in
silence
and
alone
he
led
the
way
into
the
and
there
heard
with
much
surprise
and
a
great
deal
of
concern
the
story
of
thelma
flight
ingenuous
boy
he
said
kindly
clapping
philip
on
the
shoulder
how
could
you
be
such
a
fool
as
to
think
that
repeated
visits
to
violet
vere
no
matter
on
what
business
would
not
bring
the
dogs
of
scandal
yelping
about
your
heels
i
wonder
you
did
see
how
you
were
compromising
yourself
he
never
told
a
word
about
it
interposed
lorimer
or
else
i
should
have
given
him
a
bit
of
my
mind
on
the
subject
of
course
agreed
lovelace
and
excuse
me
why
the
devil
did
you
let
your
secretary
manage
his
domestic
squabbles
by
himself
he
very
much
broken
down
said
errington
a
hopeless
frail
disappointed
man
i
thought
i
could
serve
him
i
see
and
beau
eyes
were
bent
on
him
with
a
very
friendly
look
you
a
fellow
errington
but
you
should
fly
off
so
readily
on
the
rapid
wings
of
impulse
now
i
suppose
you
want
to
shoot
lennox
that
ca
be
done
not
in
england
at
any
rate
it
ca
be
done
at
all
anywhere
said
lorimer
gravely
he
dead
beau
lovelace
started
back
in
amazement
dead
you
do
say
so
why
he
was
dining
last
night
at
the
criterion
i
saw
him
there
briefly
they
related
the
sudden
accident
that
had
occurred
and
described
its
fatal
result
he
died
horribly
said
philip
in
a
low
voice
i
have
got
over
it
yet
that
evil
tortured
face
of
his
haunts
me
lovelace
was
only
slightly
shocked
he
had
known
lennox
life
too
well
and
had
despised
it
too
thoroughly
to
feel
much
regret
now
it
was
thus
abruptly
ended
rather
an
unpleasant
exit
for
such
a
fellow
he
remarked
not
aesthetic
at
all
and
so
you
were
going
to
castigate
him
look
and
philip
showed
him
the
horsewhip
i
been
carrying
this
thing
about
all
day
i
wish
i
could
drop
it
in
the
streets
but
if
i
did
some
one
would
be
sure
to
pick
it
up
and
return
it
to
me
if
it
were
a
purse
containing
you
could
drop
it
with
the
positive
certainty
of
never
seeing
it
again
laughed
beau
here
hand
it
over
and
he
possessed
himself
of
it
i
keep
it
till
you
come
back
you
leave
for
norway
then
yes
if
i
can
but
it
the
winter
season
and
there
be
all
manner
of
difficulties
i
afraid
it
no
easy
matter
to
reach
the
altenfjord
at
this
time
of
year
why
not
use
your
yacht
and
be
independent
of
obstacles
suggested
lovelace
she
under
repairs
worse
luck
sighed
philip
despondingly
she
wo
be
in
sailing
condition
for
another
month
no
i
must
take
my
chance
that
all
it
possible
i
may
overtake
thelma
at
hull
my
great
hope
well
do
be
down
in
the
mouth
about
it
my
boy
said
beau
sympathetically
it
all
come
right
depend
upon
it
your
wife
a
sweet
gentle
noble
creature
and
when
once
she
knows
all
about
the
miserable
mistake
that
has
arisen
i
do
know
which
will
be
greatest
her
happiness
or
her
penitence
for
having
misunderstood
the
position
now
let
have
some
coffee
he
ordered
this
refreshment
from
a
passing
waiter
and
as
he
did
so
a
gentleman
with
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
a
suave
smile
on
his
countenance
bowed
to
him
with
marked
and
peculiar
courtesy
as
he
sauntered
on
his
way
through
the
room
beau
returned
the
salute
with
equal
politeness
that
whipper
he
explained
with
a
smile
when
the
gentleman
was
out
of
earshot
the
best
and
most
generous
of
men
he
a
critic
all
critics
are
and
generous
we
know
but
he
happens
to
be
remarkably
so
he
did
me
the
kindest
turn
i
ever
had
in
my
life
when
my
first
book
came
out
he
fell
upon
it
tooth
and
claw
mangled
it
tore
it
to
ribbons
metaphorically
speaking
and
waved
the
fragments
mockingly
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
from
that
day
my
name
was
made
my
writings
sold
off
with
delightful
rapidity
and
words
can
never
tell
how
i
blessed
and
how
i
still
bless
whipper
he
always
pitches
into
me
that
what
so
good
of
him
we
awfully
polite
to
each
other
as
you
observe
and
what
is
so
perfectly
charming
is
that
he
quite
unconscious
how
much
he
helped
me
along
he
really
a
fellow
but
i
have
yet
attained
the
summit
of
my
ambition
and
here
lovelace
broke
off
with
a
sparkle
of
fun
in
his
clear
eyes
why
what
else
do
you
want
asked
lorimer
laughing
i
want
returned
beau
solemnly
i
want
to
be
jeered
at
by
i
want
to
make
mouths
at
me
and
give
me
the
benefit
of
his
inimitable
squeak
and
gibber
no
author
fame
is
quite
secure
till
dear
old
has
abused
him
abuse
is
the
thing
nowadays
you
know
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
be
praised
by
that
would
be
frightfully
unfortunate
here
the
coffee
arrived
and
lovelace
dispensed
it
to
his
friends
talking
gaily
the
while
in
an
effort
to
distract
errington
from
his
gloomy
thoughts
i
just
been
informed
on
respectable
authority
that
walt
whitman
is
the
new
socrates
he
said
laughingly
i
felt
rather
stunned
at
the
moment
but
i
got
over
it
now
oh
this
deliciously
mad
london
what
a
gigantic
colney
hatch
it
is
for
the
crazed
folk
of
the
world
to
air
their
follies
in
that
any
reasonable
englishmen
with
such
names
as
shakespeare
byron
keats
and
shelley
to
keep
the
glory
of
their
country
warm
should
for
one
moment
consider
walt
whitman
a
ye
gods
where
are
your
thunderbolts
he
an
american
is
he
asked
errington
he
is
my
dear
boy
an
american
whom
the
sensible
portion
of
america
rejects
we
therefore
out
of
opposition
take
him
up
his
chief
recommendation
is
that
he
writes
blatantly
concerning
commonplaces
regardless
of
music
or
rhythm
here
a
bit
of
him
concerning
the
taming
of
oxen
he
says
the
tamer
lives
in
a
pastoral
region
there
they
bring
him
the
and
the
to
break
them
some
are
such
beautiful
animals
so
lofty
looking
some
are
some
mottled
one
has
a
white
line
running
along
his
back
some
are
brindled
some
have
wide
flaring
horns
a
good
sign
look
you
the
bright
hides
see
the
two
with
stars
on
their
foreheads
see
the
round
bodies
and
broad
backs
how
straight
and
square
they
stand
on
their
legs
stop
stop
cried
lorimer
putting
his
hands
to
his
ears
this
is
a
practical
joke
beau
no
one
would
call
that
jargon
poetry
oh
would
they
though
exclaimed
lovelace
let
some
critic
of
reputation
once
start
the
idea
and
you
have
the
good
london
folk
who
wo
bother
to
read
him
for
themselves
declaring
him
as
fine
as
shakespeare
the
dear
english
muttons
fine
southdowns
fleecy
once
let
the
tinkle
loudly
enough
across
the
fields
of
literature
and
they
follow
bleating
sweetly
in
any
direction
the
sharpest
heads
in
our
big
metropolis
are
those
who
know
this
and
who
act
accordingly
then
why
do
act
accordingly
asked
errington
with
a
faint
smile
oh
i
i
ca
i
never
asked
a
favor
from
the
press
in
my
life
but
its
little
bell
has
tinkled
for
me
all
the
same
and
a
few
of
the
muttons
follow
but
not
all
are
you
off
this
as
they
rose
to
take
their
leave
well
errington
old
fellow
and
he
shook
hands
warmly
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
and
a
happy
return
home
my
best
regards
to
your
wife
lorimer
have
you
settled
whether
you
go
with
me
to
italy
i
start
the
day
after
lorimer
hesitated
then
said
all
right
my
mother
delighted
at
the
idea
yes
beau
we
come
only
i
hope
we
sha
bore
you
bore
me
you
know
me
better
than
that
and
he
accompanied
them
out
of
the
into
the
hall
while
errington
a
little
surprised
at
this
sudden
arrangement
observed
why
george
i
thought
you
be
here
when
we
came
back
from
norway
to
to
welcome
thelma
you
know
george
laughed
my
dear
boy
i
sha
be
wanted
just
let
me
know
how
everything
goes
on
you
you
see
i
in
duty
bound
to
take
my
mother
out
of
london
in
winter
just
so
agreed
lovelace
who
had
watched
him
narrowly
while
he
spoke
do
grudge
the
old
lady
her
southern
sunshine
errington
lorimer
wants
brushing
up
a
bit
too
he
looks
seedy
then
i
shall
consider
it
settled
the
day
after
we
meet
at
charing
cross
morning
tidal
express
of
course
never
go
by
night
service
across
the
channel
if
you
can
help
it
again
they
shook
hands
and
parted
best
thing
that
young
fellow
can
do
thought
lovelace
as
he
returned
to
the
club
the
sooner
he
gets
out
of
this
into
new
scenes
the
better
he
breaking
his
heart
over
the
beautiful
thelma
by
jove
the
boy
eyes
looked
like
those
of
a
shot
animal
whenever
her
name
was
mentioned
he
rather
badly
hit
he
sat
down
and
began
to
meditate
what
can
i
do
for
him
i
wonder
he
thought
nothing
i
suppose
a
love
of
that
sort
ca
be
remedied
it
a
pity
a
great
pity
and
i
do
know
any
woman
likely
to
make
a
on
him
he
never
put
up
with
an
italian
beauty
he
paused
in
his
reflections
and
the
color
flushed
his
broad
handsome
brow
as
the
dazzling
vision
of
a
sweet
piquant
face
with
liquid
dark
eyes
and
rippling
masses
of
rich
brown
hair
came
flitting
before
him
unless
he
saw
angela
he
murmured
to
himself
softly
and
he
will
not
see
her
besides
angela
loves
and
after
this
his
meditations
seemed
to
be
particularly
pleasant
to
judge
from
the
expression
of
his
features
beau
was
by
no
means
ignorant
of
the
tender
passion
he
had
his
own
little
romance
as
beautiful
and
bright
as
a
summer
day
but
he
had
resolved
that
london
with
its
love
of
gossip
its
scandal
and
society
papers
london
that
on
account
of
his
popularity
as
a
writer
watched
his
movements
and
chronicled
his
doings
in
the
most
authoritative
and
incorrect
manner
london
should
have
no
chance
of
penetrating
into
the
secret
of
his
private
life
and
so
far
he
had
succeeded
and
was
likely
still
to
succeed
meanwhile
as
he
still
sat
in
blissful
reverie
pretending
to
read
a
newspaper
though
his
thoughts
were
far
away
from
it
errington
and
lorimer
arrived
at
the
midland
station
britta
was
already
there
with
the
luggage
she
was
excited
and
pleased
her
spirits
had
risen
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
mistress
soon
again
possibly
she
thought
gladly
they
might
find
her
at
hull
they
might
not
have
to
go
to
norway
at
all
the
train
came
up
to
the
platform
the
tickets
were
taken
and
sir
philip
with
britta
entered
a
compartment
while
lorimer
stood
outside
leaning
with
folded
arms
on
the
talking
cheerfully
you
find
her
all
right
phil
i
positive
he
said
i
think
very
probable
she
has
been
compelled
to
remain
at
hull
and
even
at
the
worst
britta
can
guide
you
all
over
norway
if
necessary
nothing
will
daunt
and
he
nodded
kindly
to
the
little
maid
who
had
regained
her
rosy
color
and
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
in
the
eagerness
she
felt
to
rejoin
her
beloved
fröken
the
gave
a
warning
shriek
philip
leaned
out
and
pressed
his
friend
hand
warmly
old
fellow
i
write
to
you
in
italy
all
right
mind
you
do
and
i
say
give
my
love
to
thelma
philip
smiled
and
promised
the
train
began
to
move
slowly
at
first
then
more
quickly
till
with
clattering
uproar
and
puffing
clouds
of
white
steam
it
rushed
forth
from
the
station
winding
through
the
arches
like
a
black
snake
till
it
had
twisted
itself
rapidly
out
of
sight
lorimer
left
alone
looked
after
it
wistfully
with
a
heavy
weight
of
unuttered
love
and
sorrow
at
his
heart
and
as
he
at
last
turned
away
those
haunting
words
that
he
had
heard
under
the
pines
at
the
altenfjord
recurred
again
and
again
to
his
memory
the
words
uttered
by
the
distraught
sigurd
and
how
true
they
were
he
thought
how
desperately
cruelly
true
good
things
may
come
for
others
but
for
the
heavens
are
empty
chapter
xxx
honor
is
an
thing
but
it
smells
sweet
to
those
in
whose
hand
it
is
ouida
disappointment
upon
disappointment
awaited
errington
at
hull
unfortunately
neither
he
nor
britta
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
good
norwegian
innkeeper
friedhof
who
had
assisted
thelma
in
her
flight
and
all
their
persistent
and
anxious
inquiries
elicited
no
news
of
her
moreover
there
was
no
boat
of
any
kind
leaving
immediately
for
norway
not
even
a
whaler
or
in
a
week
time
possibly
later
there
would
be
a
steamer
starting
for
christiansund
and
for
this
errington
though
almost
mad
with
impatience
was
forced
to
wait
and
in
the
meantime
he
roamed
about
the
streets
of
hull
looking
eagerly
at
every
woman
who
passed
him
and
always
hoping
that
thelma
herself
would
suddenly
meet
him
face
to
face
and
put
her
hands
in
his
he
wrote
to
neville
and
told
him
to
send
on
any
letters
that
might
arrive
for
him
and
by
every
post
he
waited
anxiously
for
one
from
thelma
but
none
came
to
relieve
his
mind
a
little
he
scribbled
a
long
letter
to
her
explaining
everything
telling
her
how
ardently
he
loved
and
worshipped
her
how
he
was
on
his
way
to
join
her
at
the
altenfjord
and
ending
by
the
most
passionate
vows
of
unchanging
love
and
fidelity
he
was
somewhat
soothed
when
he
had
done
this
though
he
did
not
realize
the
fact
that
in
all
probability
he
himself
might
arrive
before
the
letter
the
slow
miserable
days
went
on
the
week
was
completed
the
steamer
for
christiansund
started
at
last
and
after
a
terribly
stormy
passage
he
and
the
faithful
britta
were
landed
there
on
arrival
he
learned
that
a
vessel
bound
for
the
north
cape
had
left
on
the
previous
day
there
would
not
be
another
for
a
fortnight
cursing
his
he
resolved
to
reach
the
altenfjord
by
land
and
began
to
make
arrangements
accordingly
those
who
knew
the
country
well
endeavored
to
dissuade
him
from
this
desperate
project
the
further
north
the
greater
danger
they
told
him
moreover
the
weather
was
even
for
norway
exceptionally
trying
snow
lay
heavily
over
all
the
country
he
would
have
to
traverse
the
only
means
of
conveyance
was
by
carriole
or
the
latter
a
sort
of
sledge
used
by
the
laplanders
made
in
the
form
of
a
boat
and
generally
drawn
by
reindeer
the
capabilities
of
the
carriole
would
be
exhausted
as
soon
as
the
regions
were
reached
and
to
manage
a
successfully
required
special
skill
of
no
ordinary
kind
but
the
courageous
little
britta
made
short
work
of
all
these
difficulties
she
could
drive
a
she
knew
how
to
manage
reindeer
she
entertained
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
being
able
to
overcome
all
the
obstacles
on
the
way
at
the
same
time
she
frankly
told
sir
philip
that
the
journey
would
be
a
long
one
perhaps
occupying
several
days
that
they
would
have
to
rest
at
different
farms
or
stations
on
the
road
and
put
up
with
hard
fare
that
the
cold
would
be
intense
that
often
they
would
find
it
difficult
to
get
relays
of
the
required
reindeer
and
that
it
might
perhaps
be
wiser
to
wait
for
the
next
boat
going
to
the
north
cape
but
errington
would
hear
of
no
more
delays
each
hour
that
passed
filled
him
with
fresh
anxieties
and
once
in
norway
he
could
not
rest
the
idea
that
thelma
might
be
ill
dying
or
dead
gained
on
him
with
redoubled
force
and
his
fears
easily
communicating
themselves
to
britta
who
was
to
the
full
as
impatient
as
he
the
two
made
up
their
minds
and
providing
every
necessary
for
the
journey
they
could
think
of
they
started
for
the
far
sunless
north
through
a
white
frozen
land
which
grew
whiter
and
more
silent
the
further
they
went
even
as
the
brooding
sky
above
them
grew
darker
and
darker
the
aurora
borealis
flashed
its
brilliant
shafts
of
color
against
the
sable
breast
of
heaven
the
tall
pines
stripped
bare
every
branch
thick
with
snow
and
dropping
icicles
stood
pale
ghosts
of
the
forest
shedding
frozen
tears
the
moon
more
like
steel
than
silver
shone
frostily
cold
her
light
seeming
to
deepen
rather
than
soften
the
dreariness
of
the
land
and
on
on
on
they
went
britta
enveloped
to
the
chin
in
furs
steadily
driving
the
strange
steeds
with
their
horned
heads
casting
long
distorted
shadows
on
the
white
ground
and
philip
beside
her
urging
her
on
with
feverish
impatience
while
he
listened
to
the
smooth
trot
of
the
reindeer
the
tinkle
of
the
bells
on
their
harness
and
the
hiss
of
the
sledge
across
the
sparkling
snow
meanwhile
as
he
thus
pursued
his
long
and
difficult
journey
rumor
was
very
busy
with
his
name
in
london
everybody
that
is
everybody
worth
consideration
in
the
circle
of
the
upper
ten
was
talking
about
him
shrugging
their
shoulders
lifting
their
eyebrows
and
smiling
knowingly
whenever
he
was
mentioned
he
became
more
known
in
one
day
than
if
he
had
served
his
country
interests
in
parliament
for
years
on
the
very
morning
after
he
had
left
the
metropolis
en
route
for
norway
that
admirably
conducted
society
journal
the
appeared
and
of
course
had
its
usual
amount
of
eager
purchasers
anxious
to
see
the
latest
bit
of
aristocratic
scandal
often
these
good
folks
were
severely
disappointed
the
was
sometimes
so
frightfully
dull
that
it
had
actually
nothing
to
say
against
anybody
then
naturally
it
was
not
worth
buying
but
this
time
it
was
really
interesting
it
knocked
down
or
tried
to
knock
down
at
one
blow
a
formerly
spotless
reputation
and
really
really
said
the
upper
ten
it
was
dreadful
but
of
course
it
was
to
be
expected
those
quiet
seemingly
virtuous
persons
are
always
the
worst
when
you
come
to
know
them
yet
who
would
have
thought
it
and
society
read
the
assailing
paragraph
and
rolled
it
in
its
rank
mouth
like
a
enjoying
its
flavor
it
ran
as
follows
we
hear
on
excellent
authority
that
the
norwegian
lady
wife
of
sir
philip
is
about
to
sue
for
a
divorce
on
the
ground
of
infidelity
the
offending
dama
in
the
question
is
an
admired
actress
to
the
frequenters
of
the
brilliant
theatre
but
there
are
always
two
sides
to
these
affairs
and
it
is
rumored
that
the
fair
norwegian
who
before
her
marriage
we
understand
was
a
great
adept
in
the
art
of
milking
reindeer
on
the
shores
of
her
native
fjord
has
private
reasons
of
her
own
for
desiring
the
divorce
not
altogether
in
keeping
with
her
stated
reasons
or
her
apparent
reserve
we
are
however
always
on
the
side
of
the
fair
sex
and
as
the
faithless
husband
has
made
no
secret
of
his
new
liaison
we
do
not
hesitate
to
at
once
pronounce
in
the
lady
favor
the
case
is
likely
to
prove
interesting
to
believers
in
wedded
happiness
combined
with
the
strictest
moral
and
religious
sentiments
quite
by
accident
this
piece
of
smartness
was
seen
by
beau
lovelace
he
had
a
wholesome
contempt
for
the
and
all
its
class
he
would
never
have
looked
at
it
or
known
of
the
paragraph
had
not
a
friend
of
his
at
the
garrick
pointed
it
out
to
him
with
half
a
smile
and
half
a
sneer
it
a
damned
lie
said
beau
briefly
that
remains
to
be
proved
answered
his
friend
and
went
away
laughing
beau
read
it
over
and
over
again
his
blood
firing
with
honest
indignation
thelma
thelma
that
pure
white
lily
of
womanhood
was
she
to
have
her
stainless
life
blurred
by
the
trail
of
such
a
thing
as
the
and
was
errington
honor
to
be
attainted
in
his
absence
and
he
condemned
without
a
word
uttered
in
his
defence
detestable
blackguard
muttered
lovelace
reverting
in
his
mind
to
the
editor
of
the
journal
in
question
what
his
name
i
wonder
he
searched
and
found
it
at
the
top
of
a
column
sole
editor
and
proprietor
to
whom
all
checks
and
orders
should
be
made
payable
the
editor
can
not
be
responsible
for
the
return
of
rejected
mss
beau
noted
the
name
and
wrote
the
address
of
the
office
in
his
smiling
curiously
to
himself
the
while
i
almost
glad
errington
out
of
the
way
he
said
half
aloud
he
sha
see
this
thing
if
i
can
help
it
though
i
dare
say
some
particularly
affectionate
friend
will
send
it
to
him
carefully
marked
at
any
rate
he
need
know
it
just
yet
and
as
for
lorimer
shall
i
tell
him
no
i
wo
i
have
the
game
all
to
myself
and
by
jove
how
i
enjoy
it
an
hour
later
he
stood
in
the
office
of
the
courteously
inquiring
for
apparently
he
had
come
on
horseback
for
he
held
a
in
his
hand
the
very
whip
errington
had
left
with
him
the
previous
day
the
inky
dirty
boy
who
presided
in
solitary
grandeur
over
the
dingy
premises
stared
at
him
inquiringly
visitors
of
his
distinguished
appearance
and
manner
being
rather
uncommon
those
who
usually
had
business
with
the
great
grubbs
were
of
a
different
type
altogether
some
of
them
discarded
valets
or
footmen
who
came
to
gain
half
a
crown
or
five
shillings
by
offering
information
as
to
the
doings
of
their
late
masters
and
mistresses
shabby
supers
from
the
theatres
who
had
secured
the
last
bit
of
scandal
concerning
some
celebrated
stage
or
professional
beauty
sporting
men
and
turf
gamblers
of
the
lowest
class
unsuccessful
dramatists
and
small
verse
writers
these
with
now
and
then
a
few
ladies
ladies
of
the
ballet
and
were
the
sort
of
persons
who
daily
sought
private
converse
with
grubbs
and
beau
lovelace
with
his
massive
head
fine
muscular
figure
keen
eyes
and
mien
was
quite
a
novel
specimen
of
manhood
for
the
wondering
observation
of
the
who
scrambled
off
his
high
chair
with
haste
and
something
of
respect
as
he
said
what
name
sir
please
beaufort
lovelace
said
the
gentleman
with
a
bland
smile
here
is
my
card
ask
grubbs
whether
he
can
see
me
for
a
few
minutes
if
he
is
engaged
editors
generally
are
engaged
tell
him
i
wait
the
boy
went
off
in
a
greater
hurry
than
ever
the
name
of
lovelace
was
quite
familiar
to
him
he
knew
him
not
as
a
distinguished
novelist
but
as
who
makes
such
a
precious
lot
of
money
and
he
was
breathless
with
excitement
when
he
reached
the
small
editorial
chamber
at
the
top
of
a
dark
narrow
flight
of
stairs
wherein
sat
the
autocratic
snawley
smiling
suavely
over
a
heap
of
letters
and
disordered
mss
he
glanced
at
the
card
which
his
attendant
presented
him
ah
indeed
he
said
condescendingly
lovelace
lovelace
oh
yes
i
suppose
it
must
be
the
novelist
of
that
name
yes
show
him
up
shown
up
he
was
accordingly
he
entered
the
room
with
a
firm
tread
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
how
do
you
do
my
dear
sir
exclaimed
grubbs
warmly
you
are
well
known
to
me
by
reputation
i
am
charmed
delighted
to
make
the
personal
acquaintance
of
one
who
is
yes
let
me
say
who
is
a
brother
in
literature
sit
down
i
beg
of
you
and
he
waved
his
hand
towards
a
chair
thereby
displaying
the
great
rings
that
glittered
on
his
podgy
fingers
beau
however
did
not
seat
himself
he
only
smiled
very
coldly
and
contemptuously
we
can
discuss
the
fraternal
nature
of
our
relationship
afterwards
he
said
satirically
business
first
pray
sir
here
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
last
number
of
the
are
you
the
writer
of
this
paragraph
he
pointed
to
it
as
he
flattened
the
journal
and
laid
it
in
front
of
the
editor
on
the
desk
glanced
at
it
and
smiled
unconcernedly
no
i
am
not
but
i
happen
to
know
it
is
perfectly
correct
i
received
the
information
on
the
highest
the
very
highest
and
most
credible
authority
indeed
and
beau
lip
curled
haughtily
while
his
hand
clenched
the
more
firmly
then
allow
me
to
tell
you
sir
that
it
is
utterly
false
in
every
particular
moreover
that
it
is
a
gross
libel
published
with
deliberate
intent
to
injure
those
whom
it
presumes
to
mention
and
that
whoever
wrote
it
you
sir
you
alone
are
responsible
for
a
most
mischievous
scandalous
and
damnable
lie
grubbs
was
in
no
wise
disconcerted
honest
indignation
honestly
expressed
always
amused
him
he
was
amused
now
you
unduly
excited
lovelace
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
permit
me
to
remark
that
your
language
is
rather
extraordinary
quite
too
strong
under
the
circumstances
however
you
a
privileged
person
genius
is
always
a
little
mad
or
shall
we
say
eccentric
i
suppose
you
are
a
friend
of
sir
philip
errington
and
you
naturally
feel
hurt
yes
yes
i
quite
understand
but
the
scourge
of
the
press
the
wholesome
purifying
scourge
can
not
be
withheld
out
of
consideration
for
private
or
personal
feelings
no
no
there
a
higher
duty
the
duty
we
owe
to
the
public
i
tell
you
again
repeated
lovelace
firmly
the
whole
thing
is
a
lie
will
you
apologize
grubbs
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
aloud
apologize
my
dear
sir
you
must
be
dreaming
apologize
certainly
not
i
can
not
retract
the
statements
i
have
made
and
i
firmly
believe
them
to
be
true
and
though
there
is
a
saying
greater
the
truth
the
greater
the
libel
i
ready
sir
and
always
have
been
ready
to
sacrifice
myself
to
the
cause
of
truth
truth
truth
for
ever
tell
the
truth
and
shame
the
devil
you
are
at
liberty
to
inform
sir
philip
errington
from
me
that
as
it
is
my
object
a
laudable
and
praiseworthy
one
too
i
think
to
show
up
the
awful
immorality
now
reigning
in
our
upper
classes
i
do
not
regret
in
the
least
the
insertion
of
the
paragraph
in
question
if
it
only
makes
him
ashamed
of
his
vices
i
shall
have
done
a
good
deed
and
served
the
interests
of
society
at
large
at
the
same
time
if
he
wishes
to
bring
an
action
for
libel
you
dog
exclaimed
lovelace
fiercely
approaching
him
with
such
a
sudden
rapid
stride
that
the
astonished
editor
sprang
up
and
barricaded
himself
behind
his
own
chair
you
hope
for
that
do
you
an
action
for
libel
nothing
would
please
you
better
to
bring
your
scandalous
printed
trash
into
notoriety
to
hear
your
name
shouted
by
dirty
hawkers
and
newsboys
to
be
sentenced
as
a
misdemenent
ah
no
such
luck
for
you
i
know
the
tricks
of
your
vile
trade
there
are
other
ways
of
dealing
with
a
vulgar
bully
and
coward
and
before
the
startled
grubbs
could
realize
his
position
lovelace
closed
with
him
beat
him
under
and
struck
the
horsewhip
smartly
cross
his
back
and
shoulders
he
uttered
a
yell
of
pain
and
fury
and
strove
vigorously
to
defend
himself
but
owing
to
his
obesity
his
muscles
were
weak
and
flabby
and
he
was
powerless
against
the
activity
and
strength
of
his
opponent
lash
after
lash
descended
regularly
and
mercilessly
his
cries
which
gradually
became
like
the
roarings
of
a
bull
of
basban
were
unheard
as
the
below
profiting
by
a
few
idle
moments
had
run
across
the
street
to
buy
some
chestnuts
at
a
stall
he
particularly
patronized
beau
thrashed
on
with
increasing
enjoyment
grubbs
resisted
him
less
and
less
till
finally
he
slipped
feebly
down
on
the
floor
and
grovelled
there
gasping
and
groaning
beau
gave
him
one
or
two
more
artistic
cuts
and
stood
above
him
with
the
serene
triumphant
smile
of
a
successful
athlete
suddenly
a
loud
peal
of
laughter
echoed
from
the
doorway
a
woman
stood
there
richly
dressed
in
silk
and
fur
with
diamonds
sparkling
in
her
ears
and
diamonds
clasping
the
long
boa
at
her
throat
it
was
violet
vere
why
snawley
she
cried
with
cheerful
familiarity
how
are
you
all
broken
and
no
one
to
pick
up
the
pieces
serve
you
right
got
it
at
last
eh
do
get
up
you
look
so
comfortable
bodily
assault
gasped
grubbs
i
summons
call
the
police
call
his
voice
died
away
in
inarticulate
gurglings
and
raising
himself
he
sat
up
on
the
floor
in
a
sufficiently
abject
and
ludicrous
posture
wiping
the
tears
of
pain
from
his
eyes
beau
looked
at
the
female
intruder
and
recognized
her
at
once
he
saluted
her
with
cold
courtesy
and
turned
again
to
grubbs
you
apologize
no
i
i
beau
made
another
threatening
movement
miss
vere
interposed
stop
a
bit
she
said
regarding
him
with
her
insolent
eyes
in
which
lurked
however
an
approving
smile
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
you
seem
a
fighting
man
do
go
at
him
again
till
i
had
a
word
i
say
grubbs
you
been
hitting
at
me
in
your
trashy
paper
grubbs
still
sat
on
the
floor
groaning
you
must
eat
those
words
went
on
the
vere
calmly
eat
up
with
sauce
for
dinner
the
actress
well
known
at
the
brilliant
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
man
not
she
he
a
duffer
a
regular
stiff
one
no
go
about
him
anyhow
and
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
by
calling
me
an
offending
dama
keep
your
oaths
to
yourself
will
you
beau
lovelace
was
amused
grubbs
turned
his
watering
eye
from
one
to
the
other
in
wretched
perplexity
he
made
an
effort
to
stand
up
and
succeeded
i
have
you
arrested
sir
he
exclaimed
shaking
his
fists
at
beau
and
quivering
with
passion
on
a
charge
of
bodily
assault
shameful
bodily
assault
sir
all
right
returned
beau
coolly
if
i
were
fined
a
hundred
pounds
for
it
i
should
think
it
cheap
for
the
luxury
of
thrashing
such
a
hound
grubbs
quaked
at
the
determined
attitude
and
threatening
eye
of
his
assailant
and
turned
for
relief
to
miss
vere
whose
smile
however
was
not
sympathetic
you
better
cave
in
she
remarked
airily
you
got
the
worst
of
it
you
know
she
had
long
been
on
confidential
terms
with
the
proprietor
and
she
spoke
to
him
now
with
the
candor
of
an
old
friend
dear
me
what
do
you
expect
of
me
he
almost
whimpered
i
not
to
blame
the
paragraph
was
inserted
without
my
knowledge
by
my
he
away
just
now
and
there
why
he
cried
with
sudden
defiance
why
do
you
ask
sir
francis
lennox
about
it
he
wrote
the
whole
thing
well
he
dead
said
miss
vere
with
the
utmost
coolness
so
it
would
be
much
use
asking
he
ca
answer
you
have
to
answer
for
him
i
do
believe
it
exclaimed
grubbs
he
ca
be
dead
oh
yes
he
can
and
he
retorted
violet
and
a
good
job
too
he
was
knocked
over
by
a
train
at
charing
cross
you
see
it
in
paper
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
look
and
mind
you
contradict
all
that
stuff
about
me
in
your
next
number
do
you
hear
i
going
to
america
with
a
duke
next
month
and
i
ca
afford
to
have
my
reputation
injured
and
i
wo
be
called
a
for
any
living
she
paused
and
again
broke
out
laughing
poor
old
snawley
you
do
look
so
sore
and
she
moved
towards
the
door
lovelace
always
courteous
opened
it
for
her
she
raised
her
hard
bright
eyes
and
smiled
thanks
hope
i
shall
see
you
again
some
day
you
are
very
good
responded
beau
gravely
either
his
tone
which
was
one
chill
indifference
or
some
thing
in
his
look
irritated
her
suddenly
for
a
rash
of
hot
color
crimsoned
her
face
and
she
bit
her
lips
vexedly
as
she
descended
the
he
one
of
your
sort
she
thought
disdainfully
as
she
entered
her
cosy
brougham
and
was
driven
away
quite
too
awfully
moral
she
pulled
a
large
elaborately
cut
glass
out
of
the
pocket
of
her
cloak
and
unscrewing
the
gold
top
applied
it
not
to
her
nose
but
her
mouth
it
contained
neat
cognac
and
she
drank
a
goodly
gulp
of
it
with
evident
relish
swallowing
a
scented
immediately
afterwards
to
take
away
the
suspicious
odor
yes
quite
too
awfully
moral
she
repeated
with
a
grin
not
in
my
line
at
all
lord
it
lucky
there
are
not
many
such
fellows
about
or
what
would
become
of
a
precious
poor
business
i
should
make
of
it
meanwhile
lovelace
left
alone
again
with
grubbs
reiterated
his
demand
for
an
apology
grubbs
made
a
rush
for
the
door
as
soon
as
miss
vere
had
gone
with
the
full
intention
of
summoning
the
police
but
beau
coolly
placed
his
back
against
it
with
resolute
firmness
and
flourished
his
whip
defiantly
come
sir
none
of
this
nonsense
he
said
sternly
i
do
mean
to
leave
this
spot
till
i
have
satisfaction
if
sir
francis
lennox
wrote
that
scandalous
paragraph
the
greater
rascal
he
and
the
more
shame
to
you
for
inserting
you
who
make
it
your
business
to
know
all
the
dirty
alleys
and
dark
corners
of
life
must
have
known
character
pretty
thoroughly
there
not
the
slightest
excuse
for
you
will
you
apologize
and
retract
every
word
of
that
paragraph
in
your
next
issue
grubbs
breathless
with
rage
and
fear
glared
at
him
but
made
no
answer
if
you
refuse
to
comply
went
on
beau
deliberately
balancing
the
horsewhip
lightly
on
his
hand
i
just
tell
you
what
the
consequences
will
be
i
thrashed
you
once
and
i
thrash
you
again
i
have
only
to
give
the
cue
to
several
worthy
fellows
of
my
acquaintance
who
care
how
much
they
pay
for
their
fun
and
each
of
them
in
turn
will
thrash
you
as
for
an
action
for
libel
do
expect
it
but
i
swear
there
sha
be
a
safe
corner
in
london
for
you
if
however
you
publish
next
week
a
full
retraction
of
your
printed
lie
why
then
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
forget
that
such
an
individual
as
yourself
burdens
this
planet
there
are
the
two
alternatives
choose
grubbs
hesitated
but
coward
fear
made
him
quail
the
prospect
of
unlimited
thrashings
very
well
he
said
sullenly
write
what
you
want
put
in
i
attend
to
it
i
do
mind
obliging
miss
vere
but
all
the
same
i
have
arrested
beau
laughed
do
so
by
all
means
he
said
gaily
i
leave
my
address
with
you
he
wrote
rapidly
a
few
lines
on
a
piece
of
paper
to
the
following
effect
we
have
to
entirely
contradict
a
statement
we
made
last
week
respecting
a
supposed
forthcoming
divorce
case
in
which
sir
philip
was
seriously
implicated
there
was
no
truth
whatever
in
the
statement
and
we
herewith
apologize
most
humbly
and
heartily
for
having
inadvertently
given
credence
to
a
rumor
which
is
now
proved
to
be
utterly
false
and
without
the
slightest
shadow
of
a
foundation
he
handed
this
to
grubbs
insert
that
word
for
word
at
the
head
of
your
paragraphs
he
said
and
you
hear
no
more
of
me
unless
you
give
me
fresh
provocation
and
i
advise
you
to
think
twice
before
you
have
me
arrested
for
defend
my
own
case
and
ruin
you
i
rather
a
dangerous
customer
to
have
much
to
do
with
however
you
got
my
card
you
know
where
to
find
me
if
you
want
me
only
you
better
send
after
me
if
you
do
i
may
be
absent
he
smiled
and
drew
on
his
gloves
leisurely
eyeing
meanwhile
the
discomfited
editor
who
was
furtively
rubbing
his
shoulder
where
the
lash
had
stung
it
somewhat
severely
i
exceedingly
glad
i
hurt
you
grubbs
he
said
blandly
and
the
next
time
you
want
to
call
me
your
brother
in
literature
pray
reflect
on
the
manner
in
which
my
fraternal
affection
displayed
itself
morning
and
he
took
his
departure
with
a
quiet
step
and
serene
manner
leaving
to
his
own
meditations
which
were
far
from
agreeable
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
influence
beau
lovelace
possessed
both
on
the
press
and
in
society
he
was
a
general
favorite
a
man
whose
opinions
were
quoted
and
whose
authority
was
accepted
everywhere
if
he
appeared
to
answer
a
charge
of
assault
against
grubbs
and
defended
his
own
case
he
certainly
would
have
the
best
of
it
he
might
he
would
have
to
pay
a
fine
but
what
did
he
care
for
that
he
would
hold
up
the
and
its
proprietor
to
the
utmost
ridicule
and
opprobrium
his
brilliant
satire
and
humor
would
carry
all
before
it
and
he
would
be
still
more
utterly
routed
and
humiliated
weighing
all
these
considerations
carefully
in
his
mind
the
shrinking
editor
decided
to
sit
down
under
his
horsewhipping
in
silence
and
resignation
it
was
not
a
very
lofty
mode
of
action
still
it
was
the
safest
of
course
violet
vere
would
spread
the
story
all
through
particular
set
it
made
him
furious
to
think
of
this
yet
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
would
play
the
martyr
he
thought
the
martyr
to
the
cause
of
truth
the
injured
innocent
entrapped
by
false
information
he
might
possibly
gain
new
supporters
and
sympathizers
in
this
way
if
he
played
his
cards
carefully
he
turned
to
the
daily
paper
and
saw
there
chronicled
the
death
of
sir
francis
lennox
it
was
true
then
well
he
was
not
at
all
affected
by
it
he
merely
committed
the
dead
man
in
the
briefest
and
strongest
language
to
the
very
lowest
of
those
low
and
sulphurous
regions
over
which
satan
is
supposed
to
have
full
sway
not
a
soul
regretted
sir
francis
not
even
the
vere
whom
he
had
kept
and
surrounded
with
every
luxury
for
five
years
only
one
person
a
fair
weary
faced
woman
away
in
germany
shed
a
few
tears
over
the
letter
that
announced
his
death
to
her
and
this
was
the
deserted
wife
who
had
once
loved
him
lady
winsleigh
had
heard
the
news
she
shuddered
and
turned
very
pale
when
her
husband
gently
and
almost
pityingly
told
her
of
the
sudden
and
unprepared
end
that
had
overtaken
her
quondam
admirer
but
she
said
nothing
she
was
presiding
at
the
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
she
looked
somewhat
sad
and
listless
yet
lovelier
so
than
in
all
the
usual
pride
and
assertive
arrogance
of
her
beauty
lord
winsleigh
read
aloud
the
brief
account
of
the
accident
in
the
paper
she
listened
dreamily
still
mute
he
watched
her
with
yearning
eyes
an
awful
death
for
such
a
man
clara
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
tone
she
dared
not
look
up
she
was
trembling
nervously
how
dreadful
it
was
she
thought
to
be
thankful
that
a
man
was
dead
to
feel
a
relief
at
his
being
no
longer
in
this
world
presently
her
husband
spoke
again
more
reservedly
no
doubt
you
are
greatly
shocked
and
grieved
he
said
i
should
not
have
told
you
so
suddenly
pardon
me
i
am
not
grieved
she
murmured
unsteadily
it
sounds
horrible
to
say
so
but
i
i
am
afraid
i
am
clara
she
rose
and
came
tremblingly
towards
him
she
knelt
at
his
feet
though
he
strove
to
prevent
her
she
raised
her
large
dark
eyes
full
of
dull
agony
to
his
i
been
a
wicked
woman
harry
she
said
with
a
strange
imploring
thrill
of
passion
in
her
voice
i
am
down
down
in
the
dust
before
you
look
at
me
do
forgive
me
i
wo
ask
that
you
forgive
me
but
me
he
took
her
hands
and
laid
them
round
his
neck
he
drew
her
gently
soothingly
closer
closer
till
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
down
in
the
dust
are
you
he
whispered
brokenly
my
poor
wife
god
forbid
that
i
should
keep
you

they

whom

shall
have
the

we
from

fetters
of
the

healed
of
our
wound
of
living
shall
sleep
sound
swinburne
night
on
the
altenfjord
the
long
long
changeless
night
of
winter
the
sharp
crests
of
the
mountains
rose
in
white
appeal
against
the
darkness
of
the
sky
the
wild
north
wind
tore
through
the
leafless
branches
of
the
bringing
with
it
driving
pellets
of
stinging
hail
joyless
and
songless
the
whole
landscape
lay
as
though
frozen
into
sculptured
stone
the
sun
slept
and
the
fjord
black
with
brooding
shadows
seemed
silently
to
ask
where
where
was
the
great
king
of
light
the
glorious
god
of
the
golden
hair
and
ruddy
countenance
the
glittering
warrior
with
the
flaming
shield
and
spear
invincible
where
had
he
found
his
rest
by
what
strange
enchantment
had
he
fallen
into
so
deep
and
long
a
drowsiness
the
wind
that
had
rioted
across
the
mountains
rooting
up
great
trees
in
its
shrieking
career
northwards
grew
hushed
as
it
approached
the
altenfjord
there
a
weird
stillness
reigned
broken
only
by
the
sullen
and
monotonous
plash
of
the
invisible
waves
upon
the
scarcely
visible
shore
a
few
tiny
twinkling
lights
showed
the
irregular
outline
of
bosekop
and
now
and
then
one
or
two
with
sable
sails
and
small
colored
lamps
at
mast
and
prow
would
flit
across
the
inky
water
like
dark
messengers
from
another
world
bound
on
some
mournful
errand
human
figures
more
shadowy
than
real
were
to
be
seen
occasionally
moving
on
the
pier
and
to
the
left
of
the
little
town
as
the
eye
grew
accustomed
to
the
moveless
gloom
a
group
of
persons
like
ghosts
in
a
dream
could
be
dimly
perceived
working
busily
at
the
mending
of
nets
suddenly
a
strange
unearthly
glow
flashed
over
the
sombre
scene
a
rosy
radiance
deepening
to
brilliant
streaks
of
fire
the
dark
heavens
were
torn
asunder
and
through
them
streamed
flaring
pennons
of
light
waving
trembling
dancing
luminous
ribbons
of
red
blue
green
and
a
delicious
amber
like
the
flowing
of
golden
wine
wider
higher
more
dazzlingly
lustrous
the
wondrous
glory
shone
aloft
rising
upward
from
the
horizon
thrusting
long
spears
of
lambent
flame
among
the
murky
retreating
clouds
till
in
one
magnificent
coruscation
of
resplendent
beams
a
blazing
arch
of
gold
leaped
from
east
to
west
spanning
the
visible
breath
of
the
fjord
and
casting
towards
the
white
peaks
above
vivid
sparkles
and
reflections
of
brightness
and
color
here
was
surely
the
rainbow
bridge
of
odin
the
glittering
pathway
leading
to
valhalla
long
filmy
threads
of
emerald
and
azure
trailed
downwards
from
it
like
ropes
of
fairy
flowers
binding
it
to
the
earth
above
it
hung
a
nebulous
whiteness
a
canopy
through
which
palpitated
sudden
flashes
of
amethyst
then
as
though
the
arch
were
a
bent
bow
for
the
hand
of
some
heavenly
hunter
crimson
beams
darted
across
it
in
swift
succession
like
arrows
shot
at
the
dark
target
of
the
world
round
and
round
swept
the
varying
circles
of
color
now
advancing
now
retreating
now
turning
the
sullen
waters
beneath
into
a
quivering
mass
of
steely
green
now
beating
against
the
hills
till
they
seemed
pinnacles
of
pearls
and
diamonds
the
whole
landscape
was
transformed
and
the
shadowy
cluster
of
men
and
women
on
the
shore
paused
in
their
toil
and
turned
their
pale
faces
towards
the
rippling
splendor
the
heavy
drooping
from
their
hands
like
dark
webs
woven
by
giant
spiders
is
the
first
time
we
have
seen
the
arch
of
death
this
year
said
one
in
awed
accents
ay
ay
returned
another
with
a
sigh
and
some
one
is
bound
to
cross
it
whether
he
will
or
no
is
a
sure
sign
sure
they
all
agreed
in
hushed
voices
as
faint
and
as
the
breaking
of
the
tide
against
the
rocks
on
the
opposite
coast
as
they
spoke
the
bridge
in
the
sky
parted
asunder
and
vanished
the
brilliant
aurora
borealis
faded
by
swift
degrees
a
few
moments
and
the
land
was
again
enveloped
in
gloom
it
might
have
been
midnight
yet
by
the
clock
it
was
but
four
in
the
afternoon
dreary
indeed
was
the
altenfjord
yet
the
neighboring
village
of
talvag
was
even
drearier
there
desolation
reigned
supreme
it
was
a
frozen
region
of
bitter
shelterless
cold
where
the
inhabitants
smitten
by
the
physical
torpor
and
mental
stupefaction
engendered
by
the
long
dark
season
scarcely
stirred
out
of
their
miserable
homes
save
to
gather
extra
fuel
this
is
a
time
in
norway
when
beyond
the
arctic
circle
the
old
gods
yet
have
sway
when
in
spite
of
their
persistent
sometimes
fanatical
adherence
to
the
strictest
forms
of
christianity
the
people
almost
unconsciously
revert
to
the
superstitions
of
their
ancestors
gathering
round
the
blazing
they
recount
to
one
another
in
low
voices
the
ancient
legends
of
dead
and
gone
heroes
and
listening
to
the
yell
of
the
round
their
huts
they
still
fancy
they
hear
the
wild
of
the
valkyries
rushing
past
air
full
gallop
on
their
steeds
with
their
long
hair
floating
behind
them
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
appearance
of
the
as
they
called
that
special
form
of
the
aurora
had
impressed
the
talvig
folk
greatly
some
of
them
were
at
the
doors
and
regardless
of
the
piercing
cold
occupied
themselves
in
staring
languidly
at
a
reindeer
sledge
which
stood
outside
one
of
the
more
distant
huts
evidently
waiting
for
some
person
within
the
hoofs
of
the
animals
made
no
impression
on
the
hardened
snow
now
and
again
they
gently
shook
the
tinkling
bells
on
their
harness
but
otherwise
were
very
patient
the
sledge
was
in
charge
of
a
youthful
laplander
a
hideous
stunted
specimen
of
humanity
who
appeared
to
be
literally
sewed
up
from
head
to
foot
in
skins
this
cortege
was
evidently
an
object
of
curiosity
the
eyed
it
askance
and
with
a
sort
of
fear
for
did
it
not
belong
to
the
terrible
olaf
güldmar
and
would
not
the
laplander
a
useful
boy
well
known
in
talvig
come
to
some
fatal
harm
by
watching
even
for
a
few
minutes
the
property
of
an
acknowledged
pagan
who
could
tell
the
very
reindeer
might
be
possessed
by
evil
spirits
they
were
certainly
much
sleeker
and
finer
than
the
ordinary
run
of
such
animals
there
was
something
uncanny
in
the
very
look
of
them
thus
the
stupefied
unreasoning
talvig
folk
muttered
one
to
another
leaning
drowsily
out
of
their
doors
is
a
strange
thing
said
one
man
that
woman
as
strong
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
as
lovisa
elsland
should
call
for
one
of
the
wicked
to
visit
her
on
her
strange
enough
answered
his
neighbor
blinking
over
his
pipe
and
knocking
down
some
of
the
icicles
pendent
from
his
roof
but
maybe
it
is
to
curse
him
with
the
undying
curse
of
the
godly
she
done
that
all
her
life
said
the
first
speaker
that
true
she
been
a
faithful
servant
of
the
gospel
all
right
with
her
in
the
next
world
she
die
easily
was
it
for
her
the
shone
asked
an
old
woman
suddenly
thrusting
her
head
wrapped
in
a
red
woollen
hood
out
of
a
low
doorway
through
which
the
light
of
a
fire
sparkled
from
the
background
sending
vivid
flashes
across
the
snow
the
man
who
had
spoken
last
shook
his
head
solemnly
the
never
shone
for
a
christian
yet
he
said
gravely
no
there
something
else
in
the
wind
we
ca
see
it
but
it
will
come
it
must
come
that
sign
never
fails
and
presently
tired
of
watching
the
waiting
sledge
and
the
passive
laplander
he
retreated
within
his
house
shutting
his
door
against
the
darkness
and
the
bitter
wind
his
neighbors
followed
his
example
and
save
for
two
or
three
red
glimmers
of
light
here
and
there
the
little
village
looked
as
though
it
had
been
deserted
long
ago
a
picture
of
silence
and
solitude
meanwhile
in
lovisa
elsland
close
and
comfortless
dwelling
stood
olaf
güldmar
his
strong
stately
figure
wrapped
in
furs
seemed
almost
to
fill
the
little
place
he
had
thrown
aside
the
thick
scarf
of
wadmel
in
which
he
had
been
wrapped
to
the
eyes
while
driving
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
he
now
lifted
his
fur
cap
thus
displaying
his
silvery
hair
ruddy
features
and
open
massive
brow
at
that
moment
a
woman
who
was
busying
herself
in
putting
fresh
on
the
smouldering
fire
turned
and
regarded
him
intently
lord
lord
she
muttered
is
a
man
of
men
he
rejoiceth
in
his
strength
even
as
the
lion
and
of
what
avail
shall
the
curse
of
the
wicked
avail
against
the
soul
that
is
firmly
established
güldmar
heard
her
not
he
was
looking
towards
a
low
pallet
bed
on
which
lay
extended
at
full
length
an
apparently
insensible
form
has
she
been
long
thus
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
since
last
night
replied
the
woman
no
other
than
former
servant
ulrika
she
wakened
suddenly
and
bade
me
send
for
you
she
has
not
spoken
the
sighed
somewhat
impatiently
he
approached
the
now
blazing
and
as
he
drew
off
his
thick
fur
and
warmed
his
hands
at
the
cheerful
blaze
ulrika
again
fixed
her
dull
eyes
upon
him
with
something
of
wonder
and
reluctant
admiration
presently
she
trimmed
an
and
set
it
burning
dimly
on
the
table
then
she
went
to
the
bed
and
bent
over
it
after
a
pause
of
several
minutes
she
turned
and
made
a
beckoning
sign
with
her
finger
güldmar
advanced
a
little
when
a
sudden
eldritch
shriek
startled
him
back
almost
curdling
the
blood
in
his
veins
out
of
the
deep
obscurity
like
some
gaunt
spectre
rising
from
the
tomb
started
a
face
wrinkled
cadaverous
and
distorted
by
suffering
a
face
in
which
the
fierce
fevered
eyes
glittered
with
a
strange
and
dreadful
brilliancy
the
face
of
lovisa
elsland
stern
forbidding
and
already
dark
with
the
shadows
of
approaching
death
she
stared
vacantly
at
güldmar
whose
picturesque
head
was
illumined
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
fire
and
feebly
shaded
her
eyes
as
though
she
saw
something
that
hurt
them
ulrika
raised
her
on
her
tumbled
pillow
and
saying
in
cold
unmoved
tones
speak
now
for
the
time
is
short
she
once
more
beckoned
the
imperatively
he
approached
slowly
lovisa
elsland
he
began
in
distinct
tones
addressing
himself
to
that
ghastly
countenance
still
partly
shaded
by
one
hand
i
am
here
olaf
güldmar
dost
thou
know
me
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
a
strange
spasm
contorted
the
withered
features
of
the
dying
woman
she
bent
her
head
as
though
to
listen
to
some
echo
and
held
up
her
skinny
finger
as
though
enjoining
silence
know
thee
she
babbled
whisperingly
how
should
i
not
know
the
olaf
olaf
of
the
merry
eye
olaf
the
pride
of
the
norse
maiden
she
lifted
herself
in
a
more
erect
attitude
and
stretching
out
her
lean
arms
went
on
as
though
chanting
a
monotonous
recitative
olaf
the
wanderer
over
wild
seas
he
comes
and
goes
in
his
ship
that
sails
like
a
white
bird
on
the
sparkling
waters
long
and
silent
are
the
days
of
his
absence
mournful
are
the
fjelds
and
fjords
without
the
smile
of
olaf
olaf
the
king
she
paused
and
güldmar
regarded
her
in
pitying
wonder
her
face
changed
to
a
new
expression
one
of
wrath
and
fear
stay
stay
she
cried
in
penetrating
accents
who
comes
from
the
south
with
olaf
the
clouds
drive
fast
before
the
wind
clouds
rest
on
the
edge
of
the
dark
fjord
sails
red
as
blood
flash
against
the
sky
who
comes
with
olaf
fair
hair
ripples
against
his
breast
like
streaming
sunbeams
eyes
blue
as
the
glitter
of
the
northern
lights
are
looking
upon
him
lips
crimson
and
heavy
with
kisses
for
olaf
ah
she
broke
off
with
a
cry
and
beat
the
air
with
her
hands
as
though
to
keep
some
threatening
thing
away
from
her
back
back
dead
bride
of
olaf
torment
me
no
more
back
i
say
see
and
she
pointed
into
the
darkness
before
her
the
pale
pale
face
the
long
glittering
hair
twisted
like
a
snake
of
gold
she
glides
along
the
path
across
the
mountains
the
child
follows
the
child
why
not
kill
the
child
as
well
why
not
she
stopped
suddenly
with
a
wild
laugh
the
had
listened
to
her
ravings
with
something
of
horror
his
ruddy
cheeks
growing
paler
by
the
gods
this
is
strange
he
muttered
she
seems
to
speak
of
my
wife
yet
what
can
she
know
of
her
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
lovisa
seemed
to
have
exhausted
her
strength
presently
however
she
put
aside
her
straggling
white
hairs
from
her
forehead
and
demanded
fiercely
where
is
my
grandchild
where
is
britta
neither
güldmar
nor
ulrika
made
any
reply
but
britta
name
recalled
the
old
woman
to
herself
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
quite
collectedly
and
in
her
usual
harsh
voice
she
seemed
to
forget
all
that
she
had
just
uttered
for
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
the
as
though
she
had
but
then
perceived
him
so
you
are
come
olaf
güldmar
she
said
it
is
well
for
the
hand
of
death
is
upon
me
it
is
well
indeed
if
i
can
be
of
service
lovisa
elsland
responded
güldmar
though
i
am
but
a
sorry
consoler
holding
as
i
do
that
death
is
the
chief
blessing
and
in
no
way
to
be
regretted
at
any
time
moreover
when
the
body
grows
too
weak
to
support
the
soul
is
as
well
to
escape
from
it
with
what
speed
we
may
escape
escape
where
asked
lovisa
from
the
worm
that
dieth
not
from
the
devouring
fame
that
is
never
quenched
from
the
torturing
thirst
and
heat
and
darkness
of
hell
who
shall
escape
nay
if
that
is
all
the
comfort
thy
creed
can
give
thee
said
the
with
a
is
but
a
poor
staff
to
lean
on
lovisa
looked
at
him
mockingly
and
is
thine
so
strong
a
prop
to
thy
pride
she
asked
disdainfully
has
odin
so
endowed
thee
that
thou
shouldst
boast
of
him
listen
to
me
olaf
güldmar
i
have
but
little
strength
remaining
and
i
must
speak
briefly
thy
wife
what
of
her
said
the
hastily
thou
knewst
her
not
i
knew
her
said
lovisa
steadily
as
the
lightning
knows
the
tree
it
withers
as
the
sea
knows
the
frail
boat
it
wrecks
for
sport
on
a
windy
day
thou
haughty
olaf
i
knew
her
well
even
as
the
broken
heart
knows
its
destroyer
güldmar
looked
perplexedly
at
ulrika
surely
she
raves
again
he
said
ulrika
was
silent
rave
tell
him
i
do
not
rave
cried
lovisa
rising
in
her
bed
to
utter
her
words
with
more
strength
and
emphasis
may
be
i
have
raved
but
that
is
past
the
lord
who
will
judge
and
condemn
my
soul
bear
witness
that
i
speak
the
truth
olaf
güldmar
rememberest
thou
the
days
when
we
were
young
is
long
ago
lovisa
replied
the
with
brief
gentleness
long
ago
it
seems
but
yesterday
but
yesterday
i
saw
the
world
all
radiant
with
hope
and
joy
and
love
love
that
to
you
was
a
mere
pastime
but
with
she
shuddered
and
seemed
to
lose
herself
in
a
maze
of
dreary
recollections
love
she
presently
muttered
is
strong
as
death
jealousy
is
cruel
as
the
grave
the
coals
thereof
are
coals
of
fire
which
hath
a
most
vehement
flame
even
so
you
olaf
güldmar
have
forgotten
what
i
remember
that
once
in
that
yesterday
of
youth
you
called
me
fair
once
your
lips
branded
mine
could
i
forget
that
kiss
think
you
a
norse
woman
bred
in
a
shadow
of
the
constant
mountains
forgets
the
first
thrill
of
passion
waked
in
her
soul
light
women
of
those
lands
where
the
sun
ever
shines
on
fresh
follies
may
count
their
loves
by
the
score
but
with
us
of
the
north
love
suffices
to
fill
a
lifetime
and
was
not
my
life
filled
filled
to
overflowing
with
bitterness
and
misery
for
i
loved
you
proud
olaf
i
loved
you
the
uttered
an
exclamation
of
incredulous
astonishment
lovisa
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
with
a
dark
scorn
yes
i
loved
you
scoffer
and
unbeliever
as
you
were
and
are
accursed
of
god
and
man
i
loved
you
in
spite
of
all
that
was
said
against
you
nay
i
would
have
forsaken
my
creed
for
yours
and
condemned
my
soul
to
the
everlasting
burning
for
your
sake
i
loved
you
as
that
pale
fair
thing
you
wedded
could
never
love
her
voice
died
away
in
a
sort
of
despairing
wail
and
she
paused
by
my
soul
said
the
astounded
and
stroking
his
white
beard
in
some
embarrassment
i
never
knew
of
this
it
is
true
that
in
the
hot
days
of
youth
mischief
is
often
done
unwittingly
but
why
trouble
yourself
with
these
memories
lovisa
if
it
be
any
comfort
believe
me
i
am
sorry
harm
ever
came
to
you
through
my
thoughtless
jesting
it
matters
not
and
lovisa
regarded
him
with
a
strange
and
awful
smile
i
have
had
my
revenge
she
stopped
abruptly
then
went
on
was
a
fair
bride
you
chose
olaf
güldmar
child
of
an
alien
from
these
shores
thelma
with
the
treacherous
laughter
and
light
of
the
south
in
her
eyes
and
smile
and
i
who
had
known
love
made
friends
with
hate
she
checked
herself
and
looked
full
at
the
with
a
fiendish
joy
sparkling
in
her
eyes
she
whom
you
wedded
she
whom
you
loved
so
well
how
soon
she
died
there
was
something
so
suggestive
and
dreadful
in
the
expression
of
her
face
as
she
said
this
that
the
stout
heart
of
the
old
pulsated
more
quickly
with
a
sudden
vague
distrust
and
dread
she
gave
him
no
time
to
speak
but
laying
one
yellow
hand
on
his
arm
and
raising
her
voice
to
a
sort
of
yell
exclaimed
triumphantly
yes
yes
how
soon
she
died
bravely
bravely
done
and
no
one
ever
guessed
the
truth
no
one
ever
knew
i
her
güldmar
uttered
a
sharp
cry
and
shook
himself
free
from
her
touch
in
the
same
instant
his
hand
flew
to
the
hilt
of
the
in
his
girdle
her
by
the
gods
ulrika
sprang
before
him
shame
she
cried
sternly
she
is
dying
too
slowly
for
me
exclaimed
the
furiously
peace
peace
implored
ulrika
let
her
speak
strike
olaf
güldmar
said
lovisa
in
a
deep
voice
harsh
but
all
untremulous
strike
pagan
with
whom
the
law
of
blood
is
supreme
strike
to
the
very
center
of
my
heart
i
do
not
fear
you
i
killed
her
i
say
and
therein
i
the
servant
of
the
lord
was
justified
think
you
that
the
most
high
hath
not
commanded
his
elect
to
utterly
destroy
and
trample
underfoot
their
enemies
and
is
not
vengeance
mine
as
well
as
thine
accursed
slave
of
odin
a
spasm
of
pain
here
interrupted
her
she
struggled
violently
for
breath
and
ulrika
supported
her
güldmar
stood
motionless
white
with
restrained
fury
his
eyes
blazing
recovering
by
slow
degrees
lovisa
once
more
spoke
her
voice
was
weaker
and
sounded
a
long
way
off
yea
the
lord
hath
been
on
my
side
she
said
and
the
hideous
blasphemy
rattled
in
her
throat
as
it
was
uttered
listen
and
hear
how
he
delivered
mine
enemy
into
my
hands
i
watched
her
always
i
followed
her
many
and
many
a
time
though
she
never
saw
me
i
knew
her
favorite
path
across
the
mountains
it
led
past
a
rocky
chasm
on
the
edge
of
that
chasm
there
was
a
broad
flat
stone
and
there
she
would
sit
often
reading
or
watching
the
on
the
fjord
and
listening
to
the
prattle
of
her
child
i
used
to
dream
of
that
stone
and
wonder
if
i
could
loosen
it
it
was
strongly
imbedded
in
the
earth
but
each
day
i
went
to
it
each
day
i
moved
it
little
by
little
i
worked
till
a
mere
touch
would
have
set
it
hurling
downwards
yet
it
looked
as
firm
as
ever
güldmar
uttered
a
fierce
ejaculation
of
anguish
he
put
one
hand
to
his
throat
as
though
he
were
stifling
lovisa
watching
him
smiled
vindictively
and
continued
when
i
had
done
all
i
could
do
i
lay
in
wait
for
her
hoping
and
praying
my
hour
came
at
last
it
was
a
bright
sunny
morning
a
little
bird
had
been
twittering
above
the
very
place
as
it
flew
away
approached
a
book
was
in
her
hand
her
child
followed
her
at
some
little
distance
off
fortune
favored
me
a
cluster
of
pansies
had
opened
their
blossoms
a
few
inches
below
the
stone
she
saw
them
and
light
as
a
bird
sprang
on
it
and
reached
forward
to
gather
them
ah
and
the
wretched
woman
clapped
her
hands
and
broke
into
malignant
laughter
i
can
hear
her
quick
shriek
now
the
crash
of
the
stones
and
the
crackle
of
branches
as
she
fell
down
down
to
her
death
presently
the
child
came
running
it
was
too
young
to
understand
it
sat
down
patiently
waiting
for
its
mother
how
i
longed
to
kill
it
but
it
sang
to
itself
like
the
bird
that
had
flown
away
and
i
could
not
but
was
gone
was
silent
for
ever
the
lord
be
praised
for
all
his
mercies
was
she
smiling
olaf
güldmar
when
you
found
her
a
strange
solemnity
shadowed
the
features
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
steadily
blessing
and
honor
be
to
the
gods
of
my
fathers
he
said
i
found
her
the
change
that
came
over
lovisa
face
at
these
words
was
inexpressibly
awful
she
grew
livid
and
her
lips
twitched
convulsively
living
living
she
gasped
living
repeated
güldmar
sternly
vile
hag
your
purpose
was
frustrated
your
crime
destroyed
her
beauty
and
shortened
her
days
but
she
lived
lived
for
ten
sweet
bitter
years
hidden
away
from
all
eyes
save
mine
mine
that
never
grew
tired
of
looking
in
her
patient
heavenly
face
ten
years
i
held
her
as
one
holds
a
jewel
and
when
she
died
her
death
was
but
falling
asleep
in
these
fond
arms
lovisa
raised
herself
with
a
sharp
cry
and
wrung
her
hands
together
ten
years
ten
years
she
moaned
i
thought
her
dead
and
she
lived
on
beloved
and
loving
all
the
while
oh
god
god
why
hast
thou
made
a
mockery
of
thy
servant
she
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
then
looked
up
with
an
evil
smile
nay
but
she
that
was
best
it
is
worse
to
suffer
than
to
die
thank
god
she
ay
she
suffered
said
güldmar
fiercely
scarce
able
to
restrain
himself
from
seizing
upon
the
miserable
old
woman
and
shaking
the
sinking
life
out
of
her
and
had
i
but
guessed
who
caused
her
sufferings
by
the
sword
of
odin
i
would
have
ulrika
laid
her
hand
on
his
suddenly
upraised
arm
listen
she
whispered
a
low
wailing
like
the
cry
of
a
distressed
child
swept
round
and
round
the
house
followed
by
a
gust
of
wind
and
a
clattering
shower
of
hailstones
a
strange
blue
light
leaped
up
from
the
sparkling
log
fire
and
cast
an
unearthly
glow
through
the
room
a
deep
stillness
ensued
then
steady
and
clear
and
resonant
a
single
sound
echoed
through
the
air
like
a
long
note
played
on
an
exceedingly
sweet
silver
trumpet
it
began
softly
swelled
to
a
crescendo
then
died
delicately
away
güldmar
raised
his
head
his
face
was
full
of
rapt
and
expectant
gravity
his
action
too
was
somewhat
singular
for
he
drew
the
knife
from
his
girdle
and
kissed
the
hilt
solemnly
returning
it
immediately
to
its
sheath
at
the
same
moment
lovisa
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
flinging
the
coverings
from
her
strove
to
rise
from
her
bed
ulrika
held
her
firmly
she
struggled
feebly
yet
determinedly
gazing
the
while
with
straining
eager
glassy
eyes
into
the
gloom
of
the
opposite
corner
darkness
darkness
she
muttered
hoarsely
and
the
white
faces
of
dead
things
there
there
they
lie
all
still
at
the
foot
of
the
black
chasm
their
mouths
move
without
sound
what
what
are
they
saying
i
can
not
hear
ask
them
to
speak
louder
louder
ah
and
she
uttered
a
terrified
scream
that
made
the
rafters
ring
they
move
they
stretch
out
their
hands
cold
cold
hands
they
are
drawing
me
down
to
them
down
down
to
that
darkness
hold
me
hold
me
do
let
me
go
to
them
lord
lord
be
merciful
to
me
let
me
live
live
suddenly
she
drew
back
in
deadly
horror
gesticulating
with
her
tremulous
lean
hands
as
though
it
shut
away
the
sight
of
some
loathsome
thing
unveiled
to
her
view
who
is
it
she
asked
in
an
awful
shuddering
whisper
who
is
it
that
says
there
is
no
hell
see
still
retreating
backwards
backwards
the
clammy
dew
of
death
darkening
her
affrighted
countenance
she
turned
her
glazing
eyes
for
the
last
time
on
güldmar
her
lips
twitched
into
a
smile
of
dreadful
mockery
may
thy
gods
reward
thee
olaf
güldmar
even
as
mine
are
rewarding
and
with
these
words
her
head
dropped
heavily
on
her
breast
ulrika
laid
her
back
on
her
pillow
a
corpse
the
stern
cruel
smile
froze
slowly
on
her
dead
features
gradually
she
became
as
it
were
a
sort
of
ancient
cenotaph
carved
to
resemble
old
age
combined
with
unrepenting
evil
the
straggling
white
hair
that
rested
on
her
wrinkled
forehead
looking
merely
like
snow
fallen
on
sculptured
stone
good
lord
have
mercy
on
her
soul
murmured
ulrika
piously
as
she
closed
the
upward
staring
eyes
and
crossed
the
withered
hands
good
devil
claim
thine
own
said
güldmar
with
proudly
lifted
arm
and
quivering
disdainful
lips
thou
foolish
woman
thinkest
thou
thy
lord
makes
place
for
murderers
in
his
heaven
if
so
is
well
i
am
not
bound
there
only
the
just
can
tread
the
pathway
to
valhalla
is
a
better
creed
ulrika
looked
at
his
superb
erect
figure
and
lofty
head
and
a
strangely
anxious
expression
flitted
across
her
dull
countenance
nay
we
do
not
believe
that
the
lord
accepteth
murderers
without
they
repent
themselves
of
their
backslidings
but
if
with
penitence
they
turn
to
him
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
haply
they
may
be
numbered
among
the
elect
güldmar
eyes
flashed
i
know
not
thy
creed
woman
nor
care
to
learn
it
but
all
the
same
thou
art
deceived
in
thy
vain
imaginings
the
eternal
justice
can
not
err
call
that
justice
christ
or
odin
as
thou
wilt
i
tell
you
the
soul
of
the
innocent
bird
that
perishes
in
the
drifting
snow
is
near
and
dear
to
its
creator
but
the
tainted
soul
that
had
yonder
vile
body
for
its
tenement
was
but
a
flame
of
the
evil
one
and
accursed
from
the
beginning
it
must
return
to
him
from
whom
it
came
a
heaven
for
such
as
she
nay
rather
the
lowest
circle
of
the
furthest
and
fiercest
everlasting
fires
and
thither
do
i
commend
her
farewell
rapidly
muffling
himself
up
in
his
wraps
he
strode
out
of
the
house
he
sprang
into
his
sledge
throwing
a
generous
gratuity
to
the
small
laplander
who
had
taken
charge
of
it
and
who
now
ventured
to
inquire
has
the
good
lovisa
left
us
güldmar
burst
into
a
hard
laugh
by
my
soul
the
folks
of
talvig
take
up
murderers
for
saints
and
criminals
for
guides
is
a
wild
world
yes
she
has
gone
where
all
such
blessed
ones
go
to
heaven
he
shook
his
clenched
fist
in
the
air
then
hastily
gathering
up
the
reins
prepared
to
start
the
lapp
after
the
manner
of
his
race
was
easily
frightened
and
cowered
back
terrified
at
the
menacing
gesture
and
fierce
tone
but
quickly
bethinking
himself
of
the
liberal
fee
he
clutched
in
his
palm
he
volunteered
a
warning
to
this
kingly
old
man
with
the
streaming
white
hair
and
beard
and
his
keen
eyes
that
were
already
fixed
on
the
dark
sweep
of
the
rough
uneven
road
winding
towards
the
altenfjord
there
is
a
storm
coming
jarl
güldmar
he
stammered
güldmar
turned
his
head
why
call
me
jarl
he
demanded
half
angrily
is
a
name
i
wear
not
he
touched
the
reindeer
lightly
with
his
long
whip
the
sensitive
beast
started
and
sprang
forward
once
more
the
lapp
exclaimed
with
increased
excitement
and
uncouth
gestures
storm
is
coming
wide
dark
deep
see
how
the
sky
stoops
with
the
hidden
snow
he
pointed
to
the
north
and
there
low
on
the
horizon
was
a
lurid
red
gleam
like
a
smouldering
fire
while
just
above
it
a
greenish
blackness
of
cloud
hung
heavy
and
motionless
towards
the
central
part
of
the
heaven
two
or
three
stars
shone
with
frosty
brightness
and
through
a
few
fleecy
ribbons
of
greyish
mist
limmered
the
uncertain
promise
of
a
faint
moon
güldmar
smiled
slightly
storm
coming
he
answered
almost
gaily
that
is
well
storm
and
i
are
old
friends
my
lad
good
night
once
more
he
touched
his
horned
steeds
and
with
a
of
musical
bells
and
a
scudding
slippery
hissing
across
the
hard
snow
the
sledge
sped
off
with
rapidity
and
in
a
few
moments
its
one
little
guiding
lantern
disappeared
in
the
darkness
like
a
suddenly
extinguished
candle
the
lapp
stood
pondering
and
gazing
after
it
with
the
money
in
his
palm
till
the
cold
began
to
penetrate
even
his
thick
and
his
fat
little
body
well
anointed
with
though
it
was
and
becoming
speedily
conscious
of
this
he
scampered
with
extraordinary
agility
considering
the
dimensions
of
his
into
the
hut
where
he
had
his
dwelling
relating
to
all
who
choose
to
hear
the
news
of
old
lovisa
elsland
death
and
the
account
of
his
brief
interview
with
the
dreaded
but
generous
pagan
ulrika
watching
by
the
corpse
of
her
aged
friend
was
soon
joined
by
others
bent
on
sharing
her
vigil
and
the
house
was
presently
filled
with
woman
religious
wailings
and
prayers
for
the
departed
to
all
the
curious
inquiries
that
were
made
concerning
the
cause
of
lovisa
desire
to
see
the
before
she
died
ulrika
vouchsafed
no
reply
and
the
villagers
who
stood
somewhat
in
awe
of
her
as
a
woman
of
singular
godliness
and
discreet
reputation
soon
refrained
from
asking
any
more
questions
an
ambitious
young
lutheran
preacher
came
and
addressing
himself
to
all
assembled
loudly
extolled
the
superhuman
virtues
of
the
dead
mother
of
the
village
as
lovisa
had
been
called
amid
the
hysterical
weeping
and
moaning
of
the
mourners
he
begged
them
to
look
upon
her
venerated
face
and
observe
the
smile
of
god
own
peace
engraven
there
and
amid
all
his
eloquence
and
the
shrieking
excitement
of
his
fanatical
hearers
ulrika
alone
was
silent
she
sat
stern
and
absorbed
with
set
lips
and
lowered
eyelids
at
the
head
of
the
bed
whereon
the
corpse
was
now
laid
out
grimly
rigid
with
jaws
and
clasped
fingers
like
stiff
dried
bones
her
thoughts
dwelt
gloomily
and
intently
on
güldmar
words
the
eternal
justice
can
not
err
eternal
justice
what
sentence
would
eternal
justice
pass
upon
the
crime
of
murder
or
attempt
to
murder
i
am
guilty
the
unhappy
woman
reflected
with
a
strong
shudder
chilling
her
veins
guilty
even
as
lovisa
i
tried
to
kill
my
child
i
thought
i
hoped
it
was
dead
it
was
not
my
meaning
that
it
should
live
and
this
eternal
justice
may
be
will
judge
the
intention
more
than
the
crime
o
lord
lord
save
my
soul
teach
me
how
to
escape
from
the
condemning
fires
of
thine
anger
thus
she
prayed
and
wrestled
with
her
accusing
self
in
secret
despair
and
fear
raging
in
her
heart
though
not
a
flicker
of
her
inward
agitation
betrayed
itself
outwardly
on
her
stolid
expressionless
features
meanwhile
the
wind
rose
to
a
tearing
thunderous
gale
and
the
night
already
so
dark
darkened
yet
more
visibly
olaf
güldmar
driving
swiftly
homewards
caught
the
first
furious
gust
of
the
storm
that
came
rushing
onward
from
the
north
cape
and
as
it
swooped
sideways
against
his
light
sledge
he
was
nearly
hurled
from
his
seat
by
the
sudden
violence
of
the
shock
he
settled
himself
more
firmly
encouraging
with
a
cheery
word
the
startled
reindeer
who
stopped
short
stretching
out
their
necks
and
sniffing
the
air
their
hairy
sides
heaving
with
the
strain
of
trotting
against
the
blast
and
the
smoke
of
their
breath
steaming
upwards
in
the
frosty
air
like
white
vapor
the
way
lay
now
through
a
narrow
defile
bordered
with
tall
pines
and
as
the
terrified
animals
recovering
shook
the
tinkling
bells
on
their
harness
and
once
more
resumed
their
journey
the
road
was
comparatively
sheltered
and
the
wind
seemed
to
sink
as
suddenly
as
it
rose
there
was
a
hush
an
almost
ominous
silence
the
sledge
glided
more
slowly
between
the
even
lines
of
upright
giant
trees
crowned
with
icicles
and
draped
in
snow
the
involuntarily
loosened
the
reins
of
his
elfin
steeds
and
again
returned
to
those
painful
and
solemn
musings
from
which
the
stinging
blow
of
the
tempest
had
for
a
moment
roused
him
the
proud
heart
of
the
old
man
ached
bitterly
what
all
these
years
had
passed
and
he
the
descendant
of
a
hundred
vikings
had
been
cheated
of
justice
he
had
seen
his
wife
the
treasured
darling
of
his
days
suffering
dying
inch
by
inch
year
by
year
with
all
her
radiant
beauty
withered
and
he
had
never
known
her
destroyer
her
fall
from
the
edge
of
the
chasm
had
been
deemed
by
them
both
an
accident
and
yet
this
wretched
lovisa
elsland
mad
with
misplaced
disappointed
passion
jealousy
and
revenge
had
lived
on
to
the
extreme
of
life
triumphant
and
unsuspected
i
swear
the
gods
have
played
me
false
in
this
he
muttered
lifting
his
eyes
in
a
sort
of
fierce
appeal
to
the
motionless
pinetops
stiff
with
frost
the
mystery
of
the
old
hag
hatred
of
his
daughter
was
now
made
clear
she
resembled
her
mother
too
closely
to
escape
malice
he
remembered
the
curse
she
had
called
down
upon
the
innocent
girl
how
it
was
she
who
had
untiringly
spread
abroad
the
report
among
the
superstitious
people
of
the
place
that
thelma
was
a
witch
whose
presence
was
a
blight
upon
the
land
how
she
had
decoyed
her
into
the
power
of
dyceworthy
all
was
plain
and
notwithstanding
her
deliberate
wickedness
she
had
lived
her
life
without
punishment
this
was
what
made
güldmar
blood
burn
and
pulses
thrill
he
could
not
understand
why
the
higher
powers
had
permitted
this
error
of
justice
and
like
many
of
his
daring
ancestors
he
was
ready
to
fling
defiance
in
the
very
face
of
odin
and
demand
why
o
thou
drowsy
god
nodding
over
thy
why
didst
thou
do
this
thing
utter
fearlessness
bodily
and
spiritual
fearlessness
of
past
present
or
future
life
or
death
was
güldmar
creed
the
true
norse
warrior
spirit
was
in
him
had
he
been
told
on
heavenly
authority
that
the
lowest
range
of
the
nastrond
or
scandinavian
hell
awaited
him
he
would
have
accepted
his
fate
with
unflinching
firmness
the
indestructibility
of
the
soul
and
the
certainty
that
it
must
outlive
even
centuries
of
torture
and
triumph
gloriously
in
the
end
was
the
core
of
the
faith
he
professed
as
he
glanced
upwards
the
frozen
till
then
rigidly
erect
swayed
slightly
from
side
to
side
with
a
crackling
sound
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
this
slight
warning
of
a
fresh
attack
from
the
combative
storm
that
was
gathering
together
and
renewing
its
scattered
forces
he
began
to
think
of
his
daughter
and
the
grave
lines
on
his
face
relaxed
and
softened
is
all
fair
sailing
for
the
child
he
mused
for
that
i
should
be
grateful
the
world
has
been
made
a
soft
nest
for
my
bird
i
should
not
complain
my
own
time
is
short
his
former
anger
calmed
a
little
the
brooding
irritation
of
his
mind
became
gradually
soothed
rose
of
my
heart
he
whispered
tenderly
apostrophizing
the
memory
of
his
wife
that
lost
jewel
of
love
whose
fair
body
lay
enshrined
in
the
king
tomb
by
the
fjord
wrongfully
done
to
death
as
thou
wert
and
brief
time
as
we
had
for
loving
in
spite
of
thy
differing
creed
i
feel
that
i
shall
meet
thee
soon
yes
in
the
world
beyond
the
stars
they
will
bring
thee
to
me
in
valhalla
wheresoever
thou
art
thou
wilt
not
refuse
to
come
the
gods
themselves
can
not
unfasten
the
ties
of
love
between
us
as
he
half
thought
half
uttered
these
words
the
reindeer
again
stopped
abruptly
rearing
their
antlered
heads
and
panting
heavily
hark
what
was
that
a
clear
note
of
music
seemingly
wakened
from
the
waters
of
the
fjord
and
rising
upwards
upwards
with
distinctness
güldmar
leaned
from
his
motionless
sledge
and
listened
in
awe
it
was
the
same
sound
he
had
before
heard
as
he
stood
by
lovisa
elsland
and
was
in
truth
nothing
but
a
strong
current
of
wind
blowing
through
the
arched
and
honeycombed
rocks
by
the
sea
towards
the
higher
land
creating
the
same
effect
as
though
one
should
breathe
forcibly
through
a
instrument
of
dried
and
hollow
reeds
and
being
rendered
more
resonant
by
the
intense
cold
it
bore
a
striking
similarity
to
the
full
blast
of
a
for
the
worshipper
of
odin
it
had
a
significant
and
supernatural
meaning
and
he
repeated
his
former
action
that
of
drawing
the
knife
from
his
girdle
and
kissing
the
hilt
if
death
is
near
me
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
i
bid
it
welcome
the
gods
know
that
i
am
ready
he
waited
as
though
expecting
some
answer
but
there
was
a
brief
absolute
silence
then
with
a
wild
shriek
and
riotous
uproar
the
circling
tempest
before
uncertain
and
vacillating
in
its
wrath
pounced
downward
and
grasped
the
mountains
in
its
talons
the
strong
pines
rocked
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
bent
by
herculean
hands
crashing
their
frosted
branches
madly
together
the
massive
clouds
in
the
sky
opened
and
let
fall
their
burden
of
snow
down
came
the
large
fleecy
flakes
twisting
dizzily
round
and
round
in
a
white
waltz
to
the
whirl
of
the
wind
faster
faster
heavier
and
thicker
till
there
seemed
no
clear
space
in
the
air
güldmar
urged
on
the
reindeer
more
anxious
for
their
safety
than
his
own
the
poor
beasts
were
fatigued
and
the
blinding
snow
confused
them
but
they
struggled
on
patiently
encouraged
by
their
master
voice
and
the
consciousness
that
they
were
nearing
home
the
storm
increased
in
fury
and
a
fierce
gust
of
frozen
sleet
struck
the
sledge
like
a
strong
as
it
advanced
through
the
rapidly
deepening
its
guiding
lantern
was
extinguished
güldmar
did
not
stop
to
relight
it
he
knew
he
was
approaching
his
farm
and
he
trusted
to
the
instinct
and
sagacity
of
his
steeds
there
was
indeed
but
a
short
distance
to
go
the
narrow
wooded
defile
opened
out
on
two
roads
one
leading
direct
to
bosekop
the
other
steep
and
tortuous
winding
down
to
the
shore
of
the
fjord
this
latter
passed
the
gate
once
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
pines
the
way
would
be
more
distinctly
seen
the
very
reindeer
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
this
for
they
trotted
more
steadily
shaking
their
bells
in
even
and
rhythmical
measure
as
they
neared
the
end
of
the
long
dark
vista
a
sudden
bright
blue
glare
quivered
and
sprang
across
the
snow
a
fantastic
that
flashed
and
played
among
the
feathery
falling
flakes
of
white
till
they
looked
like
knots
and
closters
of
sparkling
jewels
the
extreme
point
of
the
close
defile
was
reached
at
last
and
here
the
landscape
opened
up
wide
rocky
and
desolate
a
weird
picture
with
the
heavy
clouds
above
repeatedly
stabbed
through
and
through
by
the
beams
of
the
aurora
borealis
and
the
blank
whiteness
of
the
ground
below
just
as
the
heads
of
the
reindeer
were
turned
into
the
homeward
road
half
of
the
aurora
suddenly
faded
leaving
the
other
half
still
beating
out
its
azure
brilliance
against
the
horizon
at
the
same
instant
with
abrupt
swiftness
a
dark
shadow
so
dark
as
to
seem
almost
palpable
descended
and
fell
directly
in
front
of
the
advancing
sledge
a
sort
of
mist
that
appeared
to
block
the
way
güldmar
leaned
forward
and
gazed
with
eager
straining
eyes
into
that
drooping
gloom
a
shadow
a
mere
vapor
with
the
northern
lights
glimmering
through
its
murky
folds
ah
no
no
for
him
it
was
something
very
different
a
heavenly
phantasm
beautiful
and
grand
with
solemn
meaning
he
saw
a
maiden
majestically
tall
of
earnest
visage
and
imperial
mien
her
long
black
hair
streamed
loose
upon
the
wind
in
one
hand
she
held
a
shining
shield
in
the
other
a
lifted
spear
on
her
white
brow
rested
a
glittering
helmet
her
bosom
heaved
beneath
a
corslet
of
pale
gold
she
fixed
her
divine
dark
eyes
full
upon
his
face
and
smiled
with
a
cry
of
wonder
and
ecstacy
the
old
man
fell
back
in
his
sledge
the
reins
dropped
from
his
hands
the
the
he
exclaimed
a
mere
breathing
space
and
the
shadow
vanished
the
aurora
came
out
again
in
unbroken
splendor
and
the
reindeer
feeling
no
restraint
upon
them
and
terrified
by
something
in
the
air
or
the
ceaseless
glitter
of
the
lights
in
the
sky
started
off
precipitately
at
full
gallop
the
long
reins
trailed
loosely
over
their
backs
lashing
their
sides
as
they
ran
güldmar
recovering
from
his
momentary
awe
and
bewilderment
strove
to
seize
them
but
in
vain
he
called
he
shouted
the
frightened
animals
were
utterly
beyond
control
and
dashed
madly
down
the
steep
road
swinging
the
sledge
from
side
to
side
and
entangling
themselves
more
and
more
with
the
loose
reins
till
irritated
beyond
endurance
confused
and
blinded
by
the
flash
of
the
aurora
and
the
dizzy
whirl
of
the
swiftly
falling
snow
they
made
straight
for
a
steep
bank
and
before
the
had
time
to
realize
the
situation
and
jump
from
the
sledge
crash
down
they
went
with
a
discordant
jangle
of
bells
their
hoofs
splitting
a
thin
sharp
shelf
of
ice
as
they
leaped
forward
dragging
the
light
vehicle
after
them
and
twisting
it
over
and
over
till
it
was
a
mere
wreck
and
throwing
out
its
occupant
head
foremost
against
a
jagged
stone
then
more
scared
than
ever
they
strove
to
clamber
out
of
the
gully
into
which
they
had
recklessly
sprung
but
foiled
in
these
attempts
they
kicked
plunged
and
reared
trampling
heedlessly
over
the
human
form
lying
helpless
among
the
shattered
fragments
of
the
sledge
till
tired
out
at
last
they
stood
motionless
panting
with
terror
their
antlered
heads
cast
fantastic
patterns
on
the
snow
in
the
varying
rose
and
azure
radiance
that
rippled
from
the
waving
ribbons
of
the
aurora
and
close
to
them
his
slowly
trickling
staining
the
white
ground
his
hair
and
beard
glittering
in
the
light
like
frosted
silver
his
eyes
fast
closed
as
though
he
slept
lay
olaf
güldmar
unconscious
dying
the
spear
of
the
valkyrie
had
fallen

eric

long
hours
passed
and
the
next
day
dawned
if
the
dim
twilight
that
glimmered
faintly
across
the
altenfjord
could
be
called
a
dawn
the
had
ceased
the
wind
had
sunk
there
was
a
monotonous
calm
the
picturesque
dwelling
of
the
was
white
in
every
part
and
fringed
with
long
icicles
icicles
drooped
from
its
sheltering
porch
and
gabled
windows
the
deserted
on
the
roof
was
a
miniature
curiously
festooned
with
thin
threads
and
crested
pinnacles
of
frozen
snow
within
the
house
there
was
silence
the
silence
of
approaching
desolation
in
the
room
where
thelma
used
to
sit
and
spin
a
blazing
fire
of
pine
sparkled
on
the
walls
casting
ruddy
outward
flashes
through
the
and
here
towards
the
obscure
noon
olaf
güldmar
awoke
from
his
long
trance
of
insensibility
he
found
himself
at
home
stretched
on
his
own
bed
and
looked
about
him
vacantly
in
the
earnest
and
watchful
countenance
that
bent
above
his
pillow
he
slowly
recognized
his
friend
companion
and
servant
valdemar
svensen
and
though
returning
consciousness
brought
with
it
throbs
of
agonizing
pain
he
strove
to
smile
and
feebly
stretched
out
his
hand
valdemar
grasped
it
kissed
it
and
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
restrain
his
emotion
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
escaped
him
the
smiled
again
then
lay
quiet
for
a
few
moments
as
though
endeavoring
to
collect
his
thought
presently
he
spoke
his
voice
was
faint
yet
distinct
what
has
happened
valdemar
he
asked
how
is
it
that
the
strength
has
departed
from
me
svensen
dropped
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
an
accident
my
lord
olaf
he
began
falteringly
güldmar
eyes
suddenly
lightened
ah
i
remember
he
said
the
rush
down
the
valley
i
remember
all
he
paused
then
added
gently
and
so
the
end
has
come
valdemar
svensen
uttered
a
passionate
exclamation
of
distress
let
not
my
lord
say
so
he
murmured
appealingly
with
the
air
of
a
subject
entreating
favor
from
a
king
or
if
it
must
be
let
me
also
travel
with
thee
wherever
thou
goest
olaf
güldmar
gaze
rested
on
him
with
a
musing
tenderness
is
a
far
journey
he
said
simply
and
thou
art
not
summoned
he
raised
his
arm
to
test
its
force
for
one
second
it
was
uplifted
then
it
fell
powerless
at
his
side
i
am
conquered
he
went
on
with
a
cheerful
air
the
fight
is
over
valdemar
surely
i
have
had
a
long
battle
and
the
time
for
rest
and
reward
is
welcome
he
was
silent
for
a
little
then
continued
tell
me
how
where
didst
thou
find
me
it
seems
i
had
a
dream
strange
and
glorious
then
came
a
rushing
sound
of
wheels
and
clanging
bells
and
after
that
a
long
deep
silence
speaking
in
low
tones
valdemar
briefly
related
the
events
of
the
past
night
how
he
had
heard
the
reindeer
gallop
down
the
road
and
the
quick
jangling
of
the
bells
on
their
harness
and
had
concluded
that
the
was
returning
home
at
extraordinary
speed
how
these
sounds
had
suddenly
and
unaccountably
ceased
how
after
waiting
for
some
time
and
hearing
nothing
more
he
had
become
greatly
alarmed
and
taking
a
had
gone
out
to
see
what
had
occurred
how
he
had
found
the
reindeer
standing
by
the
broken
sledge
in
the
gully
and
how
after
some
search
he
had
finally
discovered
his
master
lying
by
the
snow
and
grievously
injured
how
he
had
lifted
him
and
carried
him
into
the
house
by
my
soul
interrupted
the
cheerfully
thou
must
have
found
me
no
light
weight
valdemar
see
what
a
good
thing
it
is
to
be
a
man
with
iron
muscles
and
strong
limbs
and
hardy
nerve
by
the
hammer
of
thor
the
glorious
gift
of
strong
manhood
is
never
half
appreciated
as
for
me
i
am
a
man
no
longer
he
sighed
a
little
and
passing
his
sinewy
hand
across
his
brow
lay
back
exhausted
he
was
racked
by
bodily
torture
but
unflinching
old
hero
as
he
was
gave
no
sign
of
the
agonizing
pain
he
suffered
valdemar
svensen
had
risen
from
his
knees
and
now
stood
gazing
at
him
with
yearning
miserable
eyes
his
brown
visage
heavily
marked
with
lines
of
grief
and
despair
he
knew
that
he
was
utterly
powerless
that
nothing
could
save
the
noble
life
that
was
ebbing
slowly
away
before
him
his
long
and
varied
experience
as
a
sailor
pilot
and
traveller
in
many
countries
had
given
him
some
useful
knowledge
of
medicine
and
surgery
and
if
anything
was
possible
to
be
done
he
could
do
it
but
in
this
case
no
medical
skill
would
have
been
availing
the
old
man
ribs
were
crushed
in
and
his
spine
injured
his
death
was
a
question
of
but
a
few
hours
at
the
utmost
if
so
long
olaf
the
king
muttered
the
presently
true
they
make
no
mistakes
yonder
they
know
each
warrior
by
name
and
rank
is
only
in
this
world
we
are
subject
to
error
this
world
by
the
gods
is
but
a
puff
of
or
a
light
mist
floating
from
the
sunset
to
the
sea
he
made
a
vigorous
attempt
to
raise
himself
from
his
pillow
though
the
excruciating
anguish
caused
by
his
movement
made
him
wince
a
little
and
grow
paler
wine
valdemar
fill
the
horn
cup
to
the
brim
and
bring
it
to
me
i
must
have
strength
to
speak
before
i
depart
on
the
last
great
journey
obediently
and
in
haste
svensen
filled
the
cup
he
asked
for
with
old
lacrima
christi
of
which
there
was
always
a
supply
in
this
far
northern
abode
and
gave
it
to
him
watching
him
with
a
sort
of
superstitious
reverence
as
he
drained
off
its
contents
and
returned
it
empty
ah
that
warms
this
freezing
blood
of
mine
he
said
the
lustre
flashing
back
into
his
eyes
find
fresh
force
to
flow
a
brief
while
longer
valdemar
i
have
little
time
to
spend
with
thee
i
feel
death
and
he
slightly
touched
his
chest
cold
cold
and
heavy
is
nothing
a
passing
chilly
touch
that
sweeps
away
the
world
but
the
warmth
of
a
new
strong
life
awaits
me
a
life
of
triumph
the
doors
of
valhalla
stand
wide
open
i
heard
the
last
night
i
saw
the
valkyrie
all
is
well
and
my
soul
is
full
of
rejoicing
valdemar
there
is
but
one
thing
now
thou
hast
to
do
for
me
the
one
great
service
thou
hast
sworn
to
render
thine
oath
valdemar
brown
cheek
blanched
his
lips
quivered
he
flung
up
his
hands
in
wild
appeal
the
picturesque
flow
of
his
native
speech
gained
new
fervor
and
eloquence
as
he
spoke
not
yet
not
yet
my
lord
he
cried
passionately
wait
but
a
little
there
is
time
think
for
one
moment
think
would
it
not
be
well
for
my
lord
to
sleep
the
last
sleep
by
the
side
of
his
beloved
thelma
the
star
of
the
dark
mountains
the
moonbeam
of
the
night
of
his
life
would
not
peace
enwrap
him
there
as
with
a
soft
garment
and
would
not
his
rest
be
lulled
by
the
placid
murmur
of
the
sea
for
the
days
of
old
time
and
storm
and
victory
are
past
and
the
dead
slumber
as
stones
in
the
silent
pathways
why
would
my
lord
depart
in
haste
as
though
he
were
wrathful
from
the
land
he
has
loved
from
the
vassal
who
implores
his
pardon
for
pleading
against
a
deed
he
dares
not
do
dares
not
dares
not
cried
the
springing
up
from
his
couch
in
spite
of
pain
and
looking
like
some
enraged
old
lion
with
his
tossed
streaming
hair
and
glittering
eyes
serf
as
thou
art
and
coward
thinkest
thou
an
oath
such
as
thine
is
but
a
thread
of
hair
to
be
snapped
at
thy
pleasure
wilt
thou
brave
the
wrath
of
the
gods
and
the
teeth
of
the
wolf
of
nastrond
as
surely
as
the
seven
stars
shine
on
the
white
brow
of
thor
evil
shall
be
upon
thee
if
thou
refusest
to
perform
the
vow
thou
hast
sworn
and
shall
a
slave
have
strength
to
resist
the
dying
curse
of
a
king
the
pride
the
supreme
authority
the
magnified
strength
of
command
that
flushed
the
old
man
features
were
extraordinary
and
almost
terrible
in
their
impressive
grandeur
if
he
indeed
believed
himself
by
blood
a
king
and
a
descendant
of
kings
he
could
not
have
shown
a
more
forcible
display
of
personal
sovereignty
the
effect
of
his
manner
on
valdemar
was
instantaneous
the
superstitious
fears
of
that
bronzed
were
easily
aroused
his
head
drooped
he
stretched
out
his
hands
imploringly
let
not
my
lord
curse
his
servant
he
faltered
it
was
but
a
tremor
of
the
heart
that
caused
my
tongue
to
speak
foolishly
i
am
ready
i
have
sworn
the
oath
shall
be
kept
to
its
utmost
end
olaf
güldmar
threatening
countenance
relaxed
and
he
fell
back
on
his
pillows
it
is
well
he
said
feebly
and
somewhat
indistinctly
thy
want
of
will
maddened
me
i
spoke
and
lived
in
times
that
are
no
more
days
of
battle
and
glory
that
are
gone
from
men
for
ever
more
wine
valdemar
i
must
keep
a
grip
on
this
slippery
life
and
yet
i
wander
wander
into
the
night
his
voice
ceased
and
he
sank
into
a
swoon
a
swoon
that
was
like
death
his
breathing
was
scarcely
perceptible
and
svensen
alarmed
at
his
appearance
forced
some
drops
of
wine
between
his
set
lips
and
chafed
his
cold
hands
with
anxious
solicitude
slowly
and
very
gradually
he
recovered
consciousness
and
intelligence
and
presently
asked
for
a
pencil
and
paper
to
write
a
few
farewell
words
to
his
daughter
in
the
grief
and
bewilderment
of
the
time
valdemar
entirely
forgot
to
tell
him
that
a
letter
from
thelma
had
arrived
for
him
on
the
previous
afternoon
while
he
was
away
at
talvig
and
was
even
now
on
the
shelf
above
the
chimney
awaiting
perusal
güldmar
ignorant
of
this
began
to
write
slowly
and
with
firmness
disregarding
his
rapidly
sinking
strength
scarcely
had
he
begun
the
letter
however
than
he
looked
up
meaningly
at
svensen
who
stood
waiting
beside
him
the
time
grows
very
short
he
said
imperatively
prepare
everything
quickly
go
fear
not
i
shall
live
to
see
thee
return
and
to
bless
thee
for
thy
faithful
service
as
he
uttered
these
words
he
smiled
and
with
one
wistful
yearning
look
at
him
valdemar
obediently
and
instantly
departed
he
left
the
house
carrying
with
him
a
huge
pile
of
dry
brushwood
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
strung
up
to
prompt
action
rapidly
descended
the
sloping
path
thick
with
hardened
snow
that
led
downwards
to
the
fjord
on
reaching
the
shore
he
looked
anxiously
about
him
there
was
nothing
in
sight
but
the
distant
twinkling
lights
of
bosekop
the
fjord
itself
was
like
a
black
pool
so
still
that
even
the
faintest
murmur
of
its
rippling
against
the
own
private
pier
could
be
heard
the
tide
was
full
up
out
of
the
reach
of
the
encroaching
waters
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
was
güldmar
brig
the
transformed
by
the
fingers
of
the
frost
into
a
white
ship
fantastically
draped
with
threads
of
frozen
snow
and
pendent
icicles
she
was
placed
on
a
descending
plank
to
which
she
was
attached
by
a
chain
and
rope
pulley
so
that
at
any
time
of
the
weather
or
tide
she
could
be
moved
glidingly
downwards
into
deep
water
and
this
was
what
valdemar
occupied
himself
in
doing
it
was
a
hard
task
the
chains
were
stiff
with
the
frost
but
after
some
patient
and
arduous
striving
they
yielded
to
his
efforts
and
with
slow
clank
and
much
creaking
complaint
the
vessel
slid
reluctantly
down
and
plunged
forward
afloat
at
last
holding
her
ropes
valdemar
sprang
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
pier
and
fastened
her
there
and
then
getting
on
board
he
untied
and
began
to
hoist
the
sails
this
was
a
matter
of
the
greatest
difficulty
but
it
was
gradually
and
successfully
accomplished
and
a
strange
sight
the
then
presented
resting
nearly
motionless
on
the
black
fjord
her
stretched
and
frosted
canvas
looking
like
sheeted
pearl
fringed
with
silver
her
masts
white
with
encrusted
snow
and
topped
with
pointed
icicles
leaving
her
for
a
moment
valdemar
quickly
returned
carrying
the
pile
of
dry
brushwood
he
had
brought
he
descended
with
this
into
the
hold
of
the
ship
and
returned
without
it
glancing
once
more
nervously
about
him
he
jumped
from
the
deck
to
the
pier
thence
to
the
shore
and
as
he
did
so
a
long
dark
wave
rolled
up
and
broke
at
his
feet
the
capricious
wind
had
suddenly
arisen
and
a
moaning
whisper
coming
from
the
adjacent
hills
gave
warning
of
another
storm
valdemar
hurriedly
retraced
his
steps
back
to
the
house
his
work
with
the
had
occupied
him
more
than
an
hour
the
his
friend
and
master
might
have
died
during
his
absence
there
was
a
cold
sickness
at
his
heart
his
feet
seemed
heavy
as
lead
and
scarcely
able
to
carry
him
along
quickly
enough
to
his
credulous
and
visionary
mind
the
hovering
shadow
of
death
seemed
everywhere
in
every
crackling
twig
he
brushed
against
in
every
sough
of
the
wakening
gale
that
rustled
among
the
bare
pines
to
his
intense
relief
he
found
güldmar
lying
calmly
back
among
his
pillows
his
eyes
well
open
and
clear
and
an
expression
of
perfect
peace
upon
his
features
he
smiled
as
he
saw
his
servant
enter
all
is
in
readiness
he
asked
valdemar
bent
his
head
in
silent
assent
the
face
lightened
with
extraordinary
rapture
i
thank
thee
old
friend
he
said
in
low
but
glad
accents
thou
knowest
i
could
not
be
at
peace
in
any
other
grave
i
have
suffered
in
thine
absence
the
sufferings
of
the
body
that
being
yet
strong
in
spite
of
age
is
reluctant
to
take
leave
of
life
but
it
is
past
i
am
as
one
numbed
with
everlasting
frost
and
now
i
feel
no
pain
and
my
mind
is
like
a
bird
that
poises
for
a
while
over
past
and
present
ere
soaring
into
the
far
future
there
are
things
i
must
yet
say
to
thee
valdemar
give
me
thy
close
hearing
for
my
voice
is
weak
svensen
drew
closer
and
stood
in
the
humble
attitude
of
one
who
waits
a
command
from
some
supreme
chief
this
letter
went
on
the
old
man
giving
him
a
folded
paper
is
to
the
child
of
my
heart
my
thelma
send
it
to
her
when
i
am
gone
it
will
not
grieve
her
i
hope
for
as
far
as
i
could
find
words
i
have
expressed
therein
nothing
but
joy
the
joy
of
a
prisoner
set
free
tell
her
that
with
all
the
strength
of
my
perishing
body
and
escaping
soul
i
blessed
her
her
and
the
husband
in
whose
arms
she
rests
in
safety
he
raised
his
trembling
hands
solemnly
the
gods
of
my
fathers
and
their
attendant
spirits
have
her
young
life
in
their
glorious
keeping
the
joy
of
love
and
purity
and
peace
be
on
her
innocent
head
for
ever
he
paused
the
wind
wailed
mournfully
round
the
house
and
shook
the
lattice
with
a
sort
of
stealthy
clatter
like
a
forlorn
wanderer
striving
to
creep
in
to
warmth
and
shelter
here
valdemar
continued
the
presently
in
fainter
accents
at
the
same
time
handing
him
another
paper
here
are
some
scrawled
lines
they
are
plainly
set
forth
and
signed
which
make
thee
master
of
this
poor
place
and
all
that
it
contains
a
low
choked
sob
broke
from
valdemar
broad
breast
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
of
what
avail
he
murmured
brokenly
when
my
lord
departs
i
am
alone
and
friendless
the
regarded
him
with
kindly
pity
tears
from
the
stout
heart
he
inquired
with
a
sort
of
grave
wonder
weep
for
life
valdemar
not
for
death
alone
and
friendless
not
while
the
gods
are
in
heaven
cheer
thee
thou
art
strong
and
in
vigorous
pride
of
manhood
why
should
not
bright
days
come
for
thee
he
broke
off
with
a
gasp
a
sudden
access
of
pain
convulsed
him
and
rendered
his
breathing
difficult
by
sheer
force
of
will
he
mastered
the
cruel
agony
though
great
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
brow
when
he
at
last
found
voice
to
continue
i
thought
all
suffering
was
past
he
said
with
a
heroic
smile
this
foolish
flesh
and
blood
of
mine
dies
hard
but
as
i
was
saying
to
thee
valdemar
the
farm
is
thine
and
all
it
holds
save
some
few
trifles
i
have
set
down
to
be
given
to
my
child
there
is
little
worth
in
what
i
leave
thee
the
soil
is
hard
and
ungrateful
the
harvest
uncertain
and
the
cattle
few
even
the
reindeer
didst
thou
say
they
were
injured
by
their
fall
last
night
i
i
forget
no
harm
has
come
to
them
said
svensen
hastily
seeing
that
the
very
effort
of
thinking
was
becoming
too
much
for
the
old
man
they
are
safe
and
unhurt
trouble
not
about
these
things
a
strange
unearthly
radiance
transfigured
güldmar
visage
trouble
is
departing
swiftly
from
me
he
murmured
trouble
and
i
shall
know
each
other
no
more
his
voice
died
away
inarticulately
and
he
was
silent
a
little
space
suddenly
and
with
a
rush
of
vigor
that
seemed
superhuman
he
raised
himself
nearly
erect
and
pointed
outwards
with
a
commanding
gesture
bear
me
hence
he
cried
in
ringing
tones
hence
to
the
mountains
and
the
sea
with
a
sort
of
mechanical
swift
obedience
valdemar
threw
open
the
door
the
wind
rushed
coldly
into
the
house
bringing
with
it
large
feathery
flakes
of
snow
a
hand
sledge
stood
outside
the
porch
it
was
always
there
during
the
winter
being
much
used
for
visiting
the
outlying
grounds
of
the
farm
and
to
this
valdemar
prepared
to
carry
the
in
his
herculean
arms
but
on
being
lifted
from
his
couch
the
old
man
filled
with
strange
almost
delirious
force
declared
himself
able
to
stand
and
though
suffering
deadly
anguish
at
every
step
did
in
truth
manage
to
reach
and
enter
the
sledge
strongly
supported
by
valdemar
there
however
he
fainted
and
his
faithful
servant
covering
his
insensible
form
with
furs
thought
he
was
dead
but
there
was
now
no
time
for
hesitation
dead
or
living
olaf
güldmar
will
was
law
to
his
vassal
an
oath
had
been
made
and
must
be
kept
to
propel
the
sledge
down
to
the
fjord
was
an
easy
matter
how
the
rest
of
his
duty
was
accomplished
he
never
knew
he
was
conscious
of
staggering
blindly
onward
weighted
with
a
heavy
helpless
burden
he
felt
the
slippery
pier
beneath
his
feet
the
driving
snow
and
the
icy
wind
on
his
face
but
he
was
as
one
in
a
dream
realizing
nothing
plainly
till
with
a
wild
start
he
seemed
to
awake
and
lo
he
stood
on
the
glassy
deck
of
the
with
the
body
of
his
king
stretched
senseless
before
him
had
he
brought
him
there
he
could
not
remember
what
he
had
done
during
the
past
few
mad
minutes
the
earth
and
sky
whirled
dizzily
around
him
he
could
grasp
nothing
tangible
in
thought
or
memory
but
there
most
certainly
olaf
güldmar
lay
his
pallid
face
upturned
his
hair
and
beard
as
white
as
the
snow
that
clung
to
the
masts
of
his
vessel
his
hand
clenched
on
the
fur
garment
that
enwrapped
him
as
with
a
robe
of
royalty
dropping
on
his
knees
beside
him
valdemar
felt
his
heart
it
still
throbbed
fitfully
and
feebly
watching
the
intense
calm
of
the
grand
rugged
face
this
stern
sailor
this
man
of
superstitious
and
heathen
imaginations
gave
way
to
womanish
tears
tears
that
were
the
outcome
of
sincere
and
passionate
grief
his
love
was
of
an
exceptional
type
something
like
that
of
a
faithful
dog
that
refuses
to
leave
the
grave
of
its
master
he
could
contemplate
death
for
himself
with
absolute
indifference
but
not
for
the
whose
sturdy
strength
and
splendid
physique
had
seemed
to
defy
all
danger
as
he
knelt
and
wept
unrestrainedly
a
soft
change
a
delicate
transparency
swept
over
the
dark
bosom
of
the
sky
pale
pink
streaks
glittered
on
the
dusky
horizon
darts
of
light
began
to
climb
upward
into
the
clouds
and
to
plunge
downward
into
the
water
the
radiance
spread
and
gradually
formed
into
a
broad
band
of
deep
crimson
which
burned
with
a
fixed
and
intense
glow
rays
flickered
and
streamed
about
it
as
though
uncertain
what
fantastic
shape
they
should
take
to
best
display
their
brilliancy
this
tremulous
hesitation
of
varying
color
did
not
last
long
the
whole
mass
swept
together
expanding
and
contracting
with
extraordinary
swiftness
for
a
few
seconds
then
suddenly
and
clearly
defined
in
the
sky
a
kingly
crown
blazed
forth
a
crown
of
perfect
shape
its
five
points
distinctly
and
separately
outlined
and
flashing
as
with
a
million
rubies
and
diamonds
the
red
lustre
warmly
tinged
the
pale
features
of
the
dying
man
and
startled
valdemar
who
sprang
to
his
feet
and
gazed
at
that
mystic
aureola
with
a
cry
of
wonder
at
the
same
moment
olaf
güldmar
stirred
and
began
to
speak
drowsily
without
opening
his
eyes
dawn
on
the
sea
he
murmured
the
white
waves
gleam
and
sparkle
beneath
the
prow
and
the
ship
makes
swift
way
through
the
water
it
is
dawn
in
my
heart
the
dawn
of
love
for
thee
and
me
my
thelma
fear
not
the
rose
of
passion
is
a
hardy
flower
that
can
bloom
in
the
north
as
well
as
in
the
south
believe
me
thelma
thelma
he
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
realizing
his
surroundings
raised
himself
set
sail
he
cried
pointing
with
a
majestic
motion
of
his
arm
to
the
diadem
glittering
in
the
sky
why
do
we
linger
the
wind
favors
us
and
the
tide
sweeps
forward
forward
see
how
the
lights
beckon
from
the
harbor
he
bent
his
brows
and
looked
almost
angrily
at
svensen
do
what
thou
hast
to
do
and
his
tones
were
sharp
and
imperious
i
must
press
on
an
expression
of
terror
pain
and
pity
passed
over
the
countenance
for
one
instant
he
hesitated
the
next
he
descended
into
the
hold
of
the
vessel
he
was
absent
for
a
very
little
space
but
when
he
returned
his
eyes
were
wild
as
though
he
had
been
engaged
in
some
dark
and
criminal
deed
olaf
güldmar
was
still
gazing
at
the
brilliancy
in
the
heavens
which
seemed
to
increase
in
size
and
lustre
as
the
wind
rose
higher
svensen
took
his
hand
it
was
icy
cold
and
damp
with
the
dew
of
death
let
me
go
with
thee
he
implored
in
broken
accent
i
fear
nothing
why
should
i
not
venture
also
on
the
last
voyage
güldmar
made
a
faint
but
decided
sign
of
rejection
the
viking
sails
alone
to
the
grave
of
his
fathers
he
with
a
serene
and
proud
smile
alone
alone
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
vassal
may
have
place
with
him
in
his
ship
even
so
have
the
gods
willed
it
farewell
valdemar
loosen
the
ropes
and
let
me
go
thou
servest
me
ill
hasten
hasten
i
am
weary
of
waiting
his
head
fell
back
that
mysterious
shadow
which
darkens
the
face
of
the
dying
a
moment
before
dissolution
was
on
him
now
just
then
a
strange
suffocating
odor
began
to
permeate
the
air
little
wreaths
of
pale
smoke
made
their
slow
way
through
the
boards
of
the
deck
and
a
fierce
gust
of
wind
blowing
seawards
from
the
mountains
swayed
the
uneasily
to
and
fro
slowly
and
with
evident
reluctance
svensen
commenced
the
work
of
detaching
her
from
the
pier
feeling
instinctively
all
the
while
that
his
master
dying
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
when
but
one
slender
rope
remained
to
be
cast
off
he
knelt
by
the
old
man
side
said
whispered
tremblingly
that
all
was
done
at
the
same
moment
a
small
stealthy
tongue
of
red
flame
curled
up
through
the
deck
from
the
hold
and
güldmar
observing
this
smiled
i
see
thou
hast
redeemed
thine
oath
he
said
gratefully
pressing
svensen
hand
is
the
last
act
of
thine
allegiance
may
the
gods
reward
thy
faithfulness
peace
be
with
thee
we
shall
meet
hereafter
already
the
light
shines
from
the
rainbow
bridge
there
there
are
the
golden
peaks
of
the
hills
and
the
stretch
of
the
wide
sea
go
valdemar
delay
no
longer
for
my
soul
is
impatient
it
burns
it
struggles
to
be
free
go
and
farewell
stricken
to
the
heart
and
full
of
anguish
yet
in
his
submission
and
resignation
to
the
inevitable
svensen
kissed
his
master
hand
for
the
last
time
then
with
a
sort
of
fierce
sobbing
groan
wrung
from
the
very
depths
of
his
despairing
grief
he
turned
resolutely
away
and
sprang
off
the
vessel
standing
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
pier
he
let
slip
the
last
rope
that
bound
her
her
sails
filled
and
bulged
outward
her
cordage
creaked
she
shuddered
on
the
water
lurched
a
little
then
paused
in
that
brief
moment
a
loud
triumphant
cry
rang
through
the
air
olaf
güldmar
leaped
upright
on
the
deck
as
though
lifted
by
some
invisible
hand
and
confronted
his
terrified
servants
who
gazed
at
him
in
fascinated
amazement
and
awe
his
white
hair
gleamed
like
spun
silver
his
face
was
transfigured
and
wore
a
strange
rapt
look
of
pale
yet
splendid
majesty
the
dark
furs
that
clung
about
him
trailed
in
regal
folds
to
his
feet
hark
he
cried
and
his
voice
vibrated
with
deep
and
mellow
clearness
hark
to
the
thunder
of
the
galloping
hoofs
see
see
the
glitter
of
the
shield
and
spear
she
thelma
thelma
he
raised
his
arms
as
though
in
ecstacy
glory
joy
victory
and
like
a
noble
tree
struck
down
by
lightning
he
fell
dead
even
as
he
fell
the
plunged
forward
driven
forcibly
by
a
swooping
gust
of
wind
and
scudded
out
to
the
fjord
like
a
wild
bird
flying
before
a
tempest
and
while
she
thus
fled
a
sheet
of
flame
burst
through
her
sides
and
blazed
upwards
mingling
a
lurid
smoky
glow
with
the
clear
crimson
radiance
of
the
still
brilliant
and
aurora
following
the
current
she
made
swift
way
across
the
dark
water
in
the
direction
of
the
island
of
seiland
and
presently
became
a
wondrous
ship
of
fire
fire
flashed
from
her
masts
fire
folded
up
her
spars
and
sails
in
a
devouring
embrace
fire
that
leaped
and
played
and
sent
forth
a
million
showering
sparks
hissingly
into
the
waves
beneath
with
beating
heart
and
straining
eyes
valdemar
svensen
crouched
on
the
watching
in
mute
agony
the
burning
vessel
he
had
fulfilled
his
oath
that
strange
vow
that
had
so
sternly
bound
him
a
vow
that
was
the
outcome
of
his
peculiar
traditions
and
pagan
creed
long
ago
in
the
days
of
his
youth
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
worship
of
odin
and
the
past
splendors
of
the
race
of
the
great
norse
warriors
he
had
chosen
to
recognize
in
olaf
güldmar
a
true
descendant
of
kings
who
was
by
blood
and
birth
though
not
in
power
himself
a
king
and
tracing
his
legendary
history
back
to
old
and
sources
he
had
proved
satisfactorily
to
his
own
mind
that
he
svensen
must
lawfully
and
according
to
old
feudal
system
be
this
king
serf
or
vassal
and
growing
more
and
more
convinced
of
this
in
his
dreamy
and
imaginative
mind
he
had
sworn
a
sort
of
mystic
friendship
and
allegiance
which
güldmar
had
accepted
imposing
on
him
however
only
one
absolute
command
this
was
that
he
should
be
given
the
crimson
shroud
and
of
his
ancestors
for
the
idea
that
his
body
might
be
touched
by
strange
hands
shut
in
a
close
coffin
and
laid
in
the
earth
to
moulder
away
to
wormy
corruption
had
been
the
one
fantastic
dread
of
the
sturdy
old
pagan
life
and
he
had
taken
advantage
of
svensen
devotion
and
obedience
to
impress
on
him
the
paramount
importance
of
his
solitary
behest
let
no
hypocritical
prayers
be
chanted
over
my
dumb
corpse
he
had
said
my
blood
would
ooze
from
me
at
every
pore
were
i
touched
by
the
fingers
of
a
lutheran
save
this
goodly
body
that
has
served
me
so
well
from
the
inferior
dust
let
the
bright
fire
wither
it
and
the
glad
sea
drown
it
and
my
soul
beholding
its
end
afar
off
shall
rejoice
and
be
satisfied
swear
by
the
wrath
and
thunder
of
the
gods
swear
by
the
unflinching
hammer
of
thor
swear
by
the
gates
of
valhalla
and
in
the
name
of
odin
and
having
sworn
the
curse
of
all
these
be
upon
thee
if
thou
fail
to
keep
thy
vow
and
valdemar
had
sworn
now
that
the
oath
was
kept
now
that
his
promised
obedience
had
been
carried
out
to
the
extremest
letter
he
was
as
one
stupefied
shivering
yet
regardless
of
the
snow
that
began
to
fall
thickly
he
kept
his
post
staring
staring
in
drear
fascination
across
the
fjord
where
the
drifted
now
a
mass
of
flame
blown
fiercely
by
the
wind
and
gleaming
red
through
the
flaky
the
aurora
borealis
faded
by
gradual
degrees
and
the
flaming
ship
was
more
than
ever
distinctly
visible
she
was
seen
from
the
shore
of
bosekop
by
a
group
of
the
inhabitants
who
rubbing
their
dull
eyes
could
not
decide
whether
what
they
beheld
was
fire
or
a
new
phase
of
the
capricious
northern
lights
the
rapidly
descending
snow
rendering
their
vision
bewildered
and
uncertain
any
way
they
thought
very
little
about
it
they
had
had
excitement
of
another
kind
in
the
arrival
of
ulrika
from
talvig
bringing
accounts
of
the
godly
lovisa
elsland
death
moreover
an
english
steam
bound
for
the
north
cape
had
just
an
hour
previously
touched
at
their
harbor
to
land
a
passenger
a
mysterious
woman
closely
veiled
who
immediately
on
arrival
had
hired
a
sledge
and
had
bidden
the
driver
to
take
her
to
the
house
of
olaf
güldmar
an
eight
miles
journey
through
the
drifted
snow
all
this
was
intensely
interesting
to
the
good
stupid
gossiping
of
bosekop
so
much
so
indeed
that
they
scarcely
paid
any
heed
to
the
spectacle
of
the
fiery
ship
swaying
suggestively
on
the
heaving
water
and
drifting
rapidly
away
away
towards
the
frosted
peaks
of
seiland
further
and
further
she
receded
the
flames
around
her
waving
like
banners
in
a
battle
further
and
further
still
till
valdemar
svensen
from
his
station
on
the
pier
began
to
lose
sight
of
her
blazing
timbers
and
starting
from
his
reverie
he
ran
rapidly
from
the
shore
up
through
the
garden
paths
to
the
in
order
to
gain
the
summit
and
from
that
point
of
vantage
watch
the
last
glimmering
spark
of
the
viking
burial
as
he
reached
the
house
he
stopped
short
and
uttered
a
wild
exclamation
there
under
the
porch
hung
with
sparkling
icicles
stood
thelma
thelma
her
face
pale
and
weary
yet
smiling
faintly
thelma
with
the
glint
of
her
wondrous
gold
hair
escaping
from
under
her
hat
and
glittering
on
the
folds
of
her
dark
fur
mantle
i
have
come
home
valdemar
said
the
sweet
rich
penetrating
voice
where
is
my
father
as
a
man
distraught
or
in
some
dreadful
dream
valdemar
approached
her
the
strangeness
of
his
look
and
manner
filled
her
with
sudden
fear
he
caught
her
hand
and
pointed
to
the
dark
fjord
to
the
spot
where
gleamed
a
lurid
waving
wreath
of
flames
fröken
thelma
he
is
he
gasped
in
choked
hoarse
tones
where
the
gods
have
called
him
with
a
faint
shriek
of
terror
thelma
blue
eyes
turned
toward
the
shadowy
water
as
she
looked
a
long
snake
of
fire
appeared
to
leap
from
the
perishing
a
snake
that
twined
its
glittering
coils
rapidly
round
and
round
on
the
wind
and
as
rapidly
sank
down
down
to
one
glimmering
spark
which
glowed
redly
like
a
floating
lamp
for
a
brief
space
and
was
then
quenched
for
ever
the
ship
had
vanished
thelma
needed
no
explanation
she
knew
her
creed
she
understood
all
breaking
loose
from
valdemar
grasp
she
rushed
a
few
steps
forward
with
arms
outstretched
on
the
bitter
snowy
air
father
father
she
cried
aloud
and
sobbingly
wait
for
me
it
is
i
thelma
i
am
coming
father
the
white
world
around
her
grew
black
and
shuddering
like
a
shot
bird
she
fell
senseless
instantly
valdemar
raised
her
from
the
ground
and
holding
her
tenderly
and
reverently
in
his
strong
arms
carried
her
as
though
she
were
a
child
into
the
house
clouds
darkened
the
thickened
the
stern
giants
frowned
through
their
sleety
veils
at
the
arctic
desolation
of
the
land
below
them
and
over
the
charred
and
sunken
corpse
of
the
departed
servant
of
odin
sounded
the
solemn
de
profundis
of
the
sea
chapter
xxxiii
the
body
is
the
storm
the
soul
the
star
beyond
it
in
the
deep
of
nature
calm
and
yonder
on
the
steep
the
sun
of
faith
quiescent
round
and
warm
late
on
that
same
night
the
pious
ulrika
was
engaged
in
prayer
prayer
with
her
was
a
sort
of
fanatical
wrestling
of
the
body
as
well
as
of
the
soul
she
was
never
contented
unless
by
means
of
groans
and
contortions
she
could
manage
to
work
up
by
degrees
into
a
condition
of
hysteria
resembling
a
mild
epileptic
attack
in
which
state
alone
she
considered
herself
worthy
to
approach
the
deity
on
this
occasion
she
had
some
difficulty
to
attain
the
desired
result
her
soul
as
she
herself
expressed
it
was
dry
and
her
thoughts
wandered
though
she
pinched
her
neck
and
arms
with
the
hard
resoluteness
of
a
sworn
flagellant
and
groaned
lord
have
mercy
on
me
a
sinner
with
indefatigable
earnestness
she
was
considerably
startled
in
the
midst
of
these
energetic
devotions
by
a
sudden
jangling
of
sledge
bells
and
aloud
knocking
a
knocking
which
threatened
to
break
down
the
door
of
the
small
and
humble
house
she
inhabited
hastily
donning
the
coarse
gown
and
bodice
she
had
recently
taken
off
in
order
to
administer
chastisement
to
her
own
flesh
more
thoroughly
she
unfastened
her
bolts
and
bars
and
lifting
the
latch
was
confronted
by
valdemar
svensen
who
nearly
breathless
with
swift
driving
through
the
cried
out
in
quick
gasps
come
with
me
come
she
is
dying
god
help
the
man
exclaimed
ulrika
startled
who
is
dying
she
the
fröken
thelma
lady
errington
she
is
all
alone
up
there
and
he
pointed
distractedly
in
the
direction
from
whence
he
had
come
i
can
get
no
one
in
bosekop
the
women
are
cowards
all
all
afraid
to
go
near
her
and
he
wrung
his
hands
in
passionate
distress
ulrika
pulled
a
thick
shawl
from
the
nail
where
it
hung
and
wrapped
it
round
her
i
am
ready
she
said
and
without
more
delay
stepped
into
the
waiting
sledge
while
valdemar
with
an
exclamation
of
gratitude
and
relief
took
his
place
beside
her
but
how
is
it
she
asked
as
the
reindeer
started
off
at
full
speed
how
is
it
that
the
daughter
is
again
at
the
altenfjord
i
know
not
answered
svensen
despairingly
i
would
have
given
my
life
not
to
have
told
her
of
her
father
death
death
cried
ulrika
olaf
güldmar
impossible
only
last
night
i
saw
him
in
the
pride
of
his
strength
and
thought
i
never
had
beheld
so
goodly
a
man
lord
lord
that
he
should
be
in
a
few
words
svensen
related
all
that
had
happened
with
the
exception
of
the
in
the
fjord
but
ulrika
immediately
asked
is
his
body
still
in
the
house
svensen
looked
at
her
darkly
hast
thou
never
heard
ulrika
he
said
solemnly
that
the
bodies
of
men
who
follow
olaf
güldmar
creed
disappear
as
soon
as
the
life
departs
from
them
it
is
a
mystery
strange
and
terrible
but
this
is
true
my
has
gone
and
his
body
with
it
and
i
know
not
where
ulrika
surveyed
him
steadily
with
a
slow
incredulous
smile
after
a
pause
she
said
fidelity
in
a
servant
is
good
valdemar
svensen
i
know
you
well
i
also
know
that
a
pagan
shrinks
from
christian
burial
enough
said
i
will
ask
no
more
but
if
olaf
güldmar
ship
has
gone
and
he
with
it
i
warn
you
the
village
will
wonder
i
can
not
help
it
said
svensen
with
cold
brevity
i
have
spoken
truth
he
has
gone
i
saw
him
die
and
then
vanish
believe
it
or
not
as
you
will
i
care
not
and
he
drove
on
in
silence
ulrika
was
silent
too
she
had
known
valdemar
svensen
for
many
years
he
was
a
man
universally
liked
and
respected
at
all
the
harbors
and
different
of
norway
and
his
life
was
an
open
book
to
everybody
with
the
exception
of
one
page
which
was
turned
down
and
sealed
this
was
the
question
of
his
religious
belief
no
one
knew
what
form
of
faith
he
followed
it
was
only
when
he
went
to
live
with
the
after
marriage
that
the
nature
of
his
creed
was
dimly
suspected
but
ulrika
had
no
dislike
for
him
on
this
account
her
opinions
had
changed
very
much
during
the
past
few
months
as
devout
a
lutheran
as
ever
she
began
to
entertain
a
little
more
of
the
true
spirit
of
christianity
that
spirit
of
gentle
and
patient
tolerance
which
full
of
forbearance
towards
all
humanity
is
willing
to
admit
the
possibility
of
a
little
good
in
everything
even
in
the
blind
tenets
of
a
heathen
creed
part
of
this
alteration
in
her
was
due
to
the
gratitude
she
secretly
felt
towards
the
güldmar
family
for
having
saved
from
destruction
albeit
unconscious
of
his
parentage
sigurd
the
child
she
had
attempted
to
murder
the
hideous
malevolence
of
lovisa
elsland
nature
had
shown
her
that
there
be
bad
lutherans
the
invariable
tenderness
displayed
by
the
güldmars
for
her
unrecognized
helpless
and
distraught
son
had
proved
to
her
that
there
be
good
heathens
hearing
thus
suddenly
of
the
death
she
was
strangely
affected
she
could
almost
have
wept
she
felt
perfectly
convinced
that
svensen
had
made
away
with
his
master
body
by
some
mysterious
rite
connected
with
pagan
belief
she
knew
that
güldmar
himself
according
to
rumor
had
buried
his
own
wife
in
some
unknown
spot
with
strange
and
weird
ceremonials
but
she
was
inclined
to
be
tolerant
and
glancing
at
svensen
grave
pained
face
from
time
to
time
as
she
sat
beside
him
in
the
sledge
she
resolved
to
ask
him
no
more
questions
on
the
subject
but
to
accept
and
support
if
necessary
the
theory
he
had
so
emphatically
set
forth
namely
the
mystical
evanishment
of
the
corpse
by
some
supernatural
agency
as
they
neared
their
destination
she
began
to
think
of
thelma
the
beautiful
proud
girl
whom
she
remembered
best
as
standing
on
a
little
hillock
with
a
cluster
of
pansies
in
her
hand
and
sigurd
sigurd
clinging
fondly
to
her
white
skirts
with
a
wealth
of
passionate
devotion
in
his
upturned
melancholy
blue
eyes
ulrika
had
seen
her
but
once
since
then
and
that
was
on
the
occasion
when
at
the
threat
of
lovisa
elsland
and
the
command
of
the
reverend
dyceworthy
she
had
given
her
sir
philip
errington
card
with
the
false
message
written
on
it
that
had
decoyed
her
for
a
time
into
the
wily
minister
power
she
felt
a
thrill
of
shame
as
she
remembered
the
part
she
had
played
in
that
cruel
trick
and
reverting
once
more
to
the
memory
of
sigurd
whose
tragic
end
at
the
fall
of
njedegorze
she
had
learned
through
valdemar
she
resolved
to
make
amends
now
that
she
had
the
chance
and
to
do
her
best
for
thelma
in
her
suffering
and
trouble
for
who
knows
mused
ulrika
whether
it
is
not
the
lord
hand
that
is
extended
towards
me
and
that
in
the
ministering
to
the
wants
of
her
whom
i
wronged
and
whom
my
son
so
greatly
loved
i
may
not
thereby
cancel
the
past
sin
and
work
out
my
own
redemption
and
her
dull
eyes
brightened
with
hope
and
her
heart
warmed
she
began
to
feel
almost
humane
and
sympathetic
and
was
so
eager
to
commence
her
office
of
nurse
and
consoler
to
thelma
that
she
jumped
out
of
the
sledge
almost
before
it
had
stopped
at
the
farm
gate
disregarding
assistance
she
clambered
sturdily
over
the
drifted
heaps
of
slippery
snow
that
blocked
the
deserted
pathways
and
made
for
the
house
valdemar
following
her
as
soon
as
he
had
safely
fastened
up
the
sledge
which
was
not
his
own
he
having
in
emergency
borrowed
it
from
a
neighbor
as
they
approached
a
sound
came
floating
to
meet
them
a
sound
which
made
them
pause
and
look
at
each
other
in
surprise
and
anxiety
some
one
was
singing
a
voice
full
and
clear
though
with
a
strange
uncertain
quiver
in
it
rippled
out
in
wild
strains
of
minor
melody
on
the
air
for
one
moment
ulrika
listened
doubtedly
and
then
without
more
delay
ran
hastily
forward
and
entered
the
house
thelma
was
there
sitting
at
the
lattice
window
which
she
had
thrown
wide
open
to
the
icy
blast
she
had
taken
off
her
cloak
and
hat
and
her
hair
unbound
fell
about
her
in
a
great
glittering
tangle
of
gold
her
hands
were
busy
manipulating
an
imaginary
her
eyes
were
brilliant
as
jewels
but
full
of
pain
terror
and
pathos
she
smiled
a
piteous
smile
as
she
became
hazily
conscious
that
there
were
others
in
the
room
but
she
went
on
with
her
song
a
mournful
norwegian
ditty
till
a
sudden
break
in
her
voice
caused
her
to
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
and
look
up
perplexedly
that
song
pleases
you
she
asked
softly
i
am
very
glad
has
sigurd
come
home
he
wanders
so
much
poor
boy
father
dear
you
must
tell
him
how
wrong
it
is
not
to
love
philip
every
one
loves
philip
and
i
i
love
him
too
but
he
must
never
know
that
she
paused
and
sighed
that
is
my
secret
the
only
one
i
have
and
she
drooped
her
fair
head
forlornly
moved
by
intense
pity
such
as
she
had
never
felt
in
all
her
life
before
ulrika
went
up
and
tried
to
draw
her
gently
from
the
window
poor
thing
poor
thing
she
said
kindly
come
away
with
me
and
lie
down
you
must
sit
here
let
me
shut
the
lattice
it
quite
late
at
night
and
too
cold
for
you
my
dear
too
cold
and
thelma
eyed
her
wonderingly
why
it
is
and
the
sun
never
sets
the
roses
are
all
about
the
walls
i
gave
one
to
philip
yesterday
a
little
pale
rose
with
a
crimson
heart
he
wore
it
and
seemed
glad
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
forehead
with
a
troubled
air
and
watched
ulrika
who
quietly
closed
the
window
against
the
darkness
and
desolation
of
the
night
are
you
a
friend
she
asked
presently
in
anxious
tones
i
know
so
many
that
say
they
are
my
friends
but
i
am
afraid
of
them
all
and
i
have
left
them
do
you
know
why
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
ulrika
rough
arm
because
they
tell
me
my
philip
does
not
love
me
any
more
they
are
very
cruel
to
say
so
and
i
think
it
can
not
be
true
i
want
to
tell
my
father
what
they
say
because
he
will
know
and
if
it
is
true
then
i
wish
to
die
i
could
not
live
will
you
take
me
to
my
father
the
plaintive
pleading
gentleness
of
her
voice
and
look
brought
more
tears
into
ulrika
eyes
than
had
ever
been
forced
there
by
her
devotional
exercises
and
the
miserable
valdemar
already
by
his
master
death
turned
away
and
sobbingly
cursed
his
gods
for
this
new
and
undeserved
affliction
as
the
italian
peasantry
fall
to
abusing
their
saints
in
time
of
trouble
even
so
will
the
few
remaining
believers
in
norse
legendary
lore
upbraid
their
fierce
divinities
with
the
most
reckless
hardihood
when
things
go
wrong
there
were
times
when
valdemar
svensen
secretly
quailed
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
wrath
of
odin
there
were
others
when
he
was
ready
to
pluck
the
great
god
by
the
beard
and
beat
him
with
the
flat
of
his
own
drawn
sword
this
was
his
humor
at
the
present
moment
as
he
averted
his
gaze
from
the
pitiful
sight
of
his
king
fair
daughter
all
desolate
and
her
lovely
face
pale
with
anguish
her
sweet
wits
wandering
and
her
whole
demeanor
that
of
one
who
is
lost
in
some
dark
forest
and
is
weary
unto
death
she
studied
ulrika
rough
visage
attentively
and
presently
noticed
the
tears
on
her
cheeks
you
are
crying
she
said
in
a
tone
of
grave
surprise
why
it
is
foolish
to
cry
even
when
the
heart
aches
i
have
found
that
no
one
in
the
world
ever
pities
you
but
perhaps
you
do
not
know
the
world
ah
it
is
very
hard
and
cold
all
the
people
hide
their
feelings
and
pretend
to
be
what
they
are
not
it
is
difficult
to
live
so
and
i
am
tired
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
stood
up
unsteadily
stretching
out
her
little
cold
white
hands
to
ulrika
who
folded
them
in
her
own
strong
coarse
palms
yes
i
am
very
tired
she
went
on
dreamily
there
seems
to
be
nothing
that
is
true
all
is
false
and
unreal
i
can
not
understand
but
you
seem
kind
here
her
swaying
figure
tottered
and
ulrika
drew
her
more
closely
to
herself
i
think
i
know
you
you
came
with
me
in
the
train
did
you
not
yes
and
the
little
baby
smiled
and
slept
in
my
arms
nearly
all
the
way
a
violent
shuddering
seized
her
and
a
quiver
of
agony
passed
over
her
face
forgive
me
she
murmured
i
feel
ill
very
ill
and
cold
but
do
not
mind
i
think
i
am
dying
she
could
scarcely
articulate
these
last
words
she
sank
forward
fainting
on
ulrika
breast
and
that
devout
disciple
of
luther
forgetting
all
her
former
dread
of
the
white
witch
of
the
altenfjord
only
remembered
that
she
held
in
her
arms
a
helpless
woman
with
all
the
sorrows
and
pangs
of
womanhood
thick
upon
her
and
in
this
act
of
warm
and
timely
tenderness
it
may
be
that
she
cleansed
her
soiled
soul
in
the
sight
of
the
god
she
worshipped
and
won
a
look
of
pardon
from
the
eyes
of
christ
as
far
as
mundane
matters
were
concerned
she
showed
herself
a
woman
of
prompt
energy
and
decision
laying
thelma
gently
down
upon
the
very
couch
her
dead
father
had
so
lately
occupied
she
sent
the
distracted
valdemar
out
to
gather
fresh
for
the
fire
and
then
busied
herself
in
bringing
down
thelma
own
little
bed
from
the
upper
floor
airing
it
with
methodical
care
and
making
it
as
warm
and
cosy
as
a
while
she
was
engaged
in
these
preparations
thelma
regained
her
consciousness
and
began
to
toss
and
tumble
and
talk
deliriously
but
with
it
all
she
retained
the
innate
gentleness
and
patience
and
submitted
to
be
undressed
though
she
began
to
sob
pleadingly
when
ulrika
would
have
removed
her
husband
miniature
from
where
it
lay
pressed
against
her
bosom
and
taking
it
in
her
own
hand
she
kissed
and
held
it
fast
one
by
one
the
dainty
articles
of
delicate
apparel
she
wore
were
loosened
and
laid
aside
ulrika
wondering
at
the
embroidered
linen
and
costly
lace
the
like
of
which
was
never
seen
in
that
part
of
norway
but
wondering
still
more
at
the
dazzling
skin
she
thus
unveiled
a
skin
as
exquisitely
soft
and
pure
as
the
satiny
cup
of
a
nile
lily
poor
thelma
sat
resignedly
watching
her
own
attire
taken
from
her
and
allowing
herself
to
be
wrapped
in
a
comfortable
loose
garment
of
white
wadmel
as
warm
as
which
ulrika
had
found
in
a
cupboard
upstairs
and
which
indeed
had
once
belonged
to
thelma
she
and
britta
having
made
it
together
she
examined
its
texture
now
with
some
faint
interest
then
she
asked
plaintively
are
you
going
to
bury
me
you
must
put
me
to
sleep
with
my
mother
her
name
was
thelma
too
i
think
it
is
an
unlucky
name
why
my
dear
asked
ulrika
kindly
as
she
swept
the
rich
tumbled
hair
from
the
girl
eyes
and
began
to
braid
it
in
one
long
loose
plait
in
order
to
give
her
greater
ease
thelma
sighed
there
is
an
old
song
that
says
she
broke
off
shall
i
sing
it
to
you
she
asked
with
a
wild
look
no
no
said
ulrika
not
now
and
she
nodded
her
head
encouragingly
there
be
plenty
of
time
for
singing
presently
and
she
laid
her
in
bed
tucking
her
up
warmly
as
though
she
were
a
very
little
child
and
feeling
strongly
inclined
to
kiss
her
ah
but
i
should
like
to
tell
you
even
if
i
must
not
sing
and
thelma
gazed
up
anxiously
from
her
pillow
only
my
head
is
so
heavy
and
full
of
strange
noises
i
do
not
know
whether
i
can
remember
it
do
try
to
remember
it
and
ulrika
stroked
the
soft
cheek
with
a
curious
yearning
sensation
of
love
tugging
at
her
tough
heartstrings
try
to
sleep
that
will
be
better
for
you
and
she
took
from
the
fire
a
warm
nourishing
drink
she
had
prepared
and
gave
it
to
her
she
was
surprised
at
the
eagerness
with
which
the
poor
girl
seized
it
lord
help
us
i
believe
she
is
for
want
of
food
she
thought
such
indeed
was
the
fact
thelma
had
been
several
days
on
her
journey
from
hull
and
during
that
time
had
eaten
so
little
that
her
strength
had
entirely
given
way
the
provisions
on
board
the
black
polly
were
extremely
limited
and
consisted
of
nothing
but
dried
fish
hard
bread
and
weak
tea
without
milk
or
sugar
and
in
her
condition
of
health
her
system
had
rebelled
against
this
daily
untempting
bill
of
fare
ulrika
simple
but
sustaining
beverage
seemed
more
than
delicious
to
her
palate
she
drained
it
to
the
last
drop
and
as
she
returned
the
cup
a
feint
color
came
back
to
her
cheeks
and
lips
thank
you
she
said
feebly
you
are
very
good
to
me
and
now
i
do
quite
know
what
i
wished
to
say
it
was
long
ago
there
was
a
queen
named
thelma
and
some
one
a
great
warrior
loved
her
and
found
her
fair
but
presently
he
grew
tired
of
her
face
and
raised
an
army
against
her
and
took
her
throne
by
force
and
crowned
himself
king
of
all
her
land
and
the
song
says
that
queen
thelma
wandered
on
the
mountains
all
alone
till
she
died
it
was
a
sad
song
but
i
forget
the
end
and
her
voice
trailed
off
into
broken
murmurs
her
eyes
closed
and
she
slept
ulrika
watched
her
musingly
and
tenderly
wondering
what
secret
trouble
weighed
on
the
girl
mind
when
valdemar
svensen
presently
looked
in
she
made
him
a
warning
sign
and
hushing
his
footsteps
he
went
away
again
she
followed
him
out
into
the
kitchen
where
he
had
deposited
his
load
of
and
began
to
talk
to
him
in
low
tones
he
listened
the
expression
of
grief
and
fear
deepened
on
his
countenance
as
he
heard
will
she
die
he
asked
anxiously
let
us
hope
not
returned
ulrika
but
there
is
no
doubt
she
is
very
ill
and
will
be
worse
what
has
brought
her
here
i
wonder
do
you
know
valdemar
shook
his
head
where
is
her
husband
went
on
ulrika
he
ought
to
be
here
how
could
he
have
let
her
make
such
a
journey
at
such
a
time
why
did
he
not
come
with
her
there
must
be
something
wrong
svensen
looked
as
he
felt
completely
perplexed
and
despairing
he
could
think
of
no
reason
for
thelma
unexpected
appearance
at
the
altenfjord
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
letter
that
had
come
from
her
to
her
father
the
letter
which
was
still
in
the
house
unopened
well
well
it
is
very
strange
ulrika
sighed
resignedly
but
it
is
the
lord
will
and
we
must
do
our
best
for
her
that
all
and
she
began
to
enumerate
a
list
of
things
she
wanted
from
bosekop
for
her
patient
sustenance
and
comfort
you
must
fetch
all
these
she
said
as
soon
as
the
day
is
fairly
advanced
she
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
just
four
in
the
morning
and
at
the
same
time
you
had
better
call
at
the
doctor
house
he
away
interrupted
valdemar
gone
to
christiania
very
well
said
ulrika
composedly
then
we
must
do
without
him
doctors
are
never
much
use
any
way
maybe
the
lord
will
help
me
instead
and
she
returned
to
thelma
who
still
slept
though
her
face
was
now
feverishly
flushed
and
her
breathing
hurried
and
irregular
the
hours
of
the
new
day
day
though
seeming
night
passed
on
and
it
was
verging
towards
ten
when
she
woke
raving
deliriously
her
father
sigurd
philip
the
events
of
her
life
in
london
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
were
all
jumbled
fantastically
together
in
her
brain
she
talked
and
sang
incessantly
and
like
some
wild
bird
suddenly
caged
refused
to
be
quieted
ulrika
was
all
alone
with
her
valdemar
having
gone
to
execute
his
commissions
in
bosekop
and
she
had
enough
to
do
to
make
her
remain
in
bed
for
she
became
suddenly
possessed
by
a
strong
desire
to
go
sailing
on
the
fjord
and
occasionally
it
took
all
ulrika
strength
to
hold
and
keep
her
from
springing
to
the
window
whose
white
frosted
panes
seemed
to
have
some
fatal
attraction
for
her
wandering
eyes
she
spoke
of
things
strange
and
new
to
her
attendant
ears
frequently
she
pronounced
the
names
of
violet
vere
and
lady
winsleigh
with
an
accent
of
horror
then
she
would
talk
of
george
lorimer
and
pierre
duprèz
and
she
would
call
for
britta
often
sometimes
endearingly
sometimes
impatiently
the
picture
of
her
home
in
warwickshire
seemed
to
haunt
her
she
spoke
of
its
great
green
trees
its
roses
its
smooth
sloping
lawns
then
she
would
begin
to
smile
and
sing
again
in
such
a
weak
pitiful
fashion
that
ulrika
her
stern
nature
utterly
melted
at
the
sight
of
such
innocent
helpless
distraction
and
sorrow
could
do
nothing
but
fold
the
suffering
creature
in
her
arms
and
rock
her
to
and
fro
soothingly
on
her
breast
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
the
while
and
after
long
hours
of
bewilderment
and
anguish
errington
child
a
boy
was
born
dead
with
a
regretful
heart
ulrika
laid
out
the
tiny
corpse
the
withered
blossom
of
a
promised
new
delight
a
miniature
form
so
fair
and
perfect
that
it
seemed
sheer
cruelty
on
the
part
of
nature
to
deny
it
breath
and
motion
thelma
mind
still
wandered
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
anything
and
ulrika
was
almost
glad
that
this
was
so
her
anxiety
was
very
great
she
could
not
disguise
from
herself
that
thelma
life
was
in
danger
and
both
she
and
valdemar
wrote
to
sir
philip
errington
preparing
him
for
the
worst
and
urging
him
to
come
at
once
little
aware
that
the
very
night
the
lifeless
child
was
born
was
the
same
on
which
he
had
started
from
hull
for
christiansund
after
his
enforced
waiting
for
the
required
steamer
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
now
thought
ulrika
piously
but
to
trust
in
the
lord
and
hope
for
the
best
and
valdemar
svensen
made
with
his
own
hands
a
tiny
coffin
for
the
body
of
the
little
dead
boy
who
was
to
have
brought
such
pride
and
satisfaction
to
his
parents
and
one
day
rowed
it
across
the
fjord
to
that
secret
cave
where
thelma
mother
lay
enshrined
in
stone
there
he
left
it
feeling
sure
he
had
done
well
ulrika
asked
him
no
questions
she
was
entirely
absorbed
in
the
duties
that
devolved
upon
her
and
with
an
ungrudging
devotion
strange
to
see
in
her
watched
and
tended
thelma
incessantly
scarcely
allowing
herself
a
minute
space
for
rest
or
food
the
idea
that
her
present
ministration
was
to
save
her
soul
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
had
grown
upon
her
and
was
now
rooted
firmly
in
her
mind
she
never
gave
way
to
fatigue
or
inattention
every
moan
every
restless
movement
of
the
suffering
girl
obtained
her
instant
and
tender
solicitude
and
when
she
prayed
now
it
was
not
for
herself
but
for
thelma
spare
her
good
lord
she
would
implore
in
the
hyperbolical
language
she
had
drawn
from
her
study
of
the
scriptures
as
the
lily
among
thorns
so
is
she
among
the
daughters
cut
her
not
off
root
and
branch
from
the
land
of
the
living
for
her
countenance
is
comely
and
as
a
bunch
of
myrrh
which
hath
a
powerful
sweetness
even
so
must
she
surely
be
to
the
heart
of
her
husband
stretch
forth
thy
right
hand
o
lord
and
scatter
healing
for
the
gates
of
death
shall
not
prevail
against
thy
power
day
after
day
she
poured
out
petitions
such
as
these
and
with
the
dogged
persistency
of
a
soldier
serving
cromwell
believed
that
they
would
be
granted
though
day
after
day
thelma
seemed
to
grow
weaker
and
weaker
she
was
still
her
face
grew
thin
and
shadowy
her
hands
were
almost
transparent
in
their
whiteness
and
delicacy
and
her
voice
was
so
faint
as
to
be
nearly
sometimes
ulrika
got
frightened
at
her
appearance
and
heartily
wished
for
medical
assistance
but
this
was
not
to
be
had
therefore
she
was
compelled
to
rely
on
the
efficacy
of
one
simple
remedy
a
herbal
drink
to
allay
fever
the
virtues
of
which
she
had
been
taught
in
her
youth
this
and
the
healing
mercies
of
mother
nature
together
with
the
reserved
strength
of
her
own
constitution
were
the
threads
on
which
thelma
life
hung
time
passed
on
and
yet
there
was
no
news
from
sir
philip
one
night
sitting
beside
her
exhausted
patient
ulrika
fancied
she
saw
a
change
on
the
wan
face
a
softer
more
peaceful
look
than
had
been
there
for
many
days
half
in
fear
half
in
hope
she
watched
thelma
seemed
to
sleep
but
presently
her
large
blue
eyes
opened
with
a
calm
yet
wondering
expression
in
their
clear
depths
she
turned
slightly
on
her
pillows
and
smiled
faintly
have
i
been
ill
she
asked
yes
my
dear
returned
ulrika
softly
overjoyed
yet
afraid
at
the
girl
returning
intelligence
very
ill
but
you
feel
better
now
you
thelma
sighed
and
raising
her
little
wasted
hand
examined
it
curiously
her
wedding
and
betrothal
rings
were
so
loose
on
her
finger
that
they
would
have
fallen
off
had
they
been
held
downwards
she
seemed
surprised
at
this
but
made
no
remark
for
some
time
she
remained
quiet
steadfastly
gazing
at
ulrika
and
evidently
trying
to
make
out
who
she
was
presently
she
spoke
again
i
remember
everything
now
she
said
slowly
i
am
at
home
at
the
altenfjord
and
i
know
how
i
came
and
also
i
came
here
her
lips
quivered
and
i
shall
see
my
father
no
more
for
he
has
gone
and
i
am
all
all
alone
in
the
world
she
paused
then
added
do
you
think
i
am
dying
if
so
i
am
very
glad
hush
my
dear
said
ulrika
you
must
talk
in
that
way
your
husband
is
coming
presently
she
broke
off
suddenly
startled
at
the
look
of
utter
despair
in
thelma
eyes
you
are
wrong
she
replied
wearily
he
will
not
come
he
can
not
he
does
not
want
me
any
more
and
two
large
tears
rolled
slowly
down
her
pale
cheeks
ulrika
wondered
but
forebore
to
pursue
the
subject
further
fearing
to
excite
or
distress
her
and
contented
herself
for
the
present
with
attending
to
her
patient
bodily
needs
she
went
to
the
fire
and
began
to
pour
out
some
nourishing
soup
which
she
always
had
there
in
readiness
and
while
she
was
thus
engaged
thelma
brain
cleared
more
and
more
till
with
touching
directness
and
a
new
hope
flushing
her
face
she
asked
softly
and
beseechingly
for
her
child
i
forgot
she
said
simply
and
sweetly
of
course
i
am
not
alone
any
more
do
give
me
my
baby
i
am
much
better
nearly
well
and
i
should
like
to
kiss
it
ulrika
stood
mute
taken
aback
by
this
demand
she
dared
not
tell
her
the
truth
she
feared
its
effect
on
the
sensitive
mind
that
had
so
lately
regained
its
balance
but
while
she
hesitated
thelma
instinctively
guessed
all
she
strove
to
hide
it
is
dead
she
cried
dead
and
i
never
knew
and
burying
her
golden
head
in
her
pillows
she
broke
into
a
passion
of
convulsive
sobbing
ulrika
grew
positively
desperate
at
the
sound
what
she
to
do
everything
seemed
to
go
against
her
she
was
inclined
to
cry
herself
she
embraced
the
girl
and
tried
to
soothe
her
but
in
vain
the
long
delirium
and
subsequent
weakness
combined
with
the
secret
trouble
on
her
mind
had
deprived
poor
thelma
of
all
resisting
power
and
she
wept
on
and
on
in
arms
till
nature
was
exhausted
and
she
could
weep
no
longer
then
she
lay
motionless
with
closed
eyes
utterly
drained
in
body
and
spirit
scarcely
breathing
and
save
for
a
shivering
moan
that
now
and
then
escaped
her
she
seemed
almost
insensible
ulrika
watched
her
with
darkening
meditative
brows
she
listened
to
the
rush
of
the
without
it
was
past
eleven
at
night
she
began
to
count
on
her
fingers
it
was
the
sixteenth
day
since
the
birth
of
the
child
sixteen
days
exactly
since
she
had
written
to
sir
philip
errington
informing
him
of
his
wife
danger
and
the
danger
was
not
yet
past
thinking
over
all
that
had
happened
and
the
apparent
hopelessness
of
the
case
she
suddenly
took
a
strange
idea
into
her
head
retiring
to
a
distant
corner
she
dropped
on
her
knees
o
lord
god
almighty
she
said
in
a
fierce
whisper
behold
i
have
been
thy
servant
until
now
i
have
wrestled
with
thee
in
prayer
till
i
am
past
all
patience
if
thou
wilt
not
hear
my
petition
why
callest
thou
thyself
good
is
it
good
to
crush
the
already
fallen
is
it
good
to
have
no
mercy
on
the
sorrowful
wilt
thou
condemn
the
innocent
without
reason
if
so
thou
art
not
the
holy
one
i
imagined
send
forth
thy
power
now
now
while
there
is
time
rescue
her
that
is
lying
under
the
shadow
of
death
for
how
has
she
offended
thee
that
she
should
die
delay
no
longer
or
how
shall
i
put
my
trust
in
thee
send
help
speedily
from
thine
everlasting
habitations
or
behold
i
do
forsake
thee
and
my
soul
shall
seek
elsewhere
for
eternal
justice
as
she
finished
this
extraordinary
and
entirely
blasphemous
petition
the
boisterous
gale
roared
wildly
round
the
house
joining
in
chorus
with
the
stormy
dash
of
waves
upon
the
coast
a
chorus
that
seemed
to
ulrika
ears
like
the
sound
of
fiendish
and
derisive
laughter
she
stood
listening
a
trifle
scared
yet
with
a
sort
of
fanatical
defiance
written
on
her
face
and
she
waited
in
sullen
patience
evidently
expecting
an
immediate
answer
to
her
outrageous
prayer
she
felt
somewhat
like
a
demagogue
of
the
people
who
boldly
menaces
an
sovereign
even
while
in
dread
of
instant
execution
there
was
a
sharp
patter
of
sleet
on
the
window
she
glanced
nervously
at
thelma
who
perfectly
still
on
her
couch
looked
more
like
a
white
recumbent
statue
than
a
living
woman
the
wind
shook
the
doors
and
whistled
shrilly
through
the
crevices
then
as
though
tired
of
its
own
wrath
surged
away
in
hoarse
murmurs
over
the
tops
of
the
creaking
pines
towards
the
fjord
and
there
was
a
short
impressive
silence
ulrika
still
waited
almost
holding
her
breath
in
expectation
of
some
divine
manifestation
the
brief
stillness
grew
hush
what
was
that
jingle
jangle
jingle
jangle
bells
sledge
bells
tinkling
musically
and
merrily
and
approaching
swiftly
nearer
nearer
now
the
sharp
trotting
roofs
on
the
hard
snow
then
a
sudden
slackening
of
speed
the
little
metallic
chimes
rang
slower
and
yet
more
slowly
till
with
a
decisive
and
melodious
clash
they
stopped
ulrika
heart
beat
thickly
her
face
flushed
she
advanced
to
bedside
hoping
fearing
she
knew
not
what
there
was
a
tread
of
firm
yet
hurried
footsteps
without
a
murmur
of
subdued
voices
a
exclamation
of
surprise
and
relief
from
valdemar
and
then
the
door
of
the
room
was
hastily
thrown
open
and
a
man
tall
figure
draped
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
garment
of
frozen
snowflakes
stood
on
the
threshold
the
noise
startled
thelma
she
opened
her
beautiful
tired
blue
eyes
ah
what
a
divine
rapture
what
a
dazzling
wonder
and
joy
flashed
into
them
giving
them
back
their
old
lustre
of
sunlight
sparkling
on
azure
sea
she
sprang
up
in
her
bed
and
stretched
out
her
arms
philip
she
cried
sobbingly
philip
oh
my
darling
try
try
to
love
me
again
just
a
little
before
i
die
as
she
spoke
she
was
clasped
to
his
breast
folded
to
his
heart
in
that
strong
jealous
passionate
embrace
with
which
we
who
love
would
fain
shield
our
nearest
and
dearest
from
even
the
shadow
of
evil
his
lips
closed
on
hers
and
in
the
sacred
stillness
that
followed
ulrika
slipped
from
the
room
leaving
husband
and
wife
alone
together
chapter
xxxiv
i
have
led
her
home
my
love
my
only
friend
there
is
none
like
her
none
and
never
yet
so
warmly
ran
my
blood
and
sweetly
on
and
on
calming
itself
to
the
end
full
to
the
banks
close
on
the
promised
good
tennyson
britta
was
in
the
kitchen
dragging
off
her
cloak
and
fur
mufflers
and
crying
heartily
all
the
while
the
stalwart
svensen
stood
looking
at
her
in
perplexity
now
and
then
uttering
a
word
of
vague
sympathy
and
consolation
to
which
she
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
the
poor
girl
was
tired
out
and
with
the
piercing
cold
the
excitement
which
had
kept
her
up
for
days
and
days
had
yielded
to
the
nervous
exhaustion
which
was
its
natural
result
and
she
kept
on
weeping
without
exactly
knowing
why
she
wept
throughout
the
long
and
fatiguing
journey
she
had
maintained
unflinching
energy
and
perseverance
undaunted
by
storm
sleet
and
darkness
she
had
driven
steadily
over
long
miles
of
trackless
snow
her
instinct
had
guided
her
by
the
shortest
and
quickest
routes
she
seemed
to
know
every
station
and
village
on
the
way
she
always
managed
to
obtain
relays
of
reindeer
just
when
they
were
needed
in
short
errington
would
hardly
have
been
able
to
reach
the
altenfjord
without
her
he
had
never
realized
to
its
full
extent
her
strong
indomitable
devoted
character
till
he
saw
her
hour
after
hour
seated
beside
him
in
the
her
hands
tightly
gripping
the
reins
of
the
horned
animals
whose
ways
she
understood
and
perfectly
controlled
her
bright
eyes
fixed
with
watchful
eagerness
on
the
bewildering
white
landscape
that
opened
out
incessantly
before
her
her
common
sense
was
never
at
fault
she
forgot
nothing
and
with
gentle
but
respectful
firmness
she
would
insist
on
sir
philip
taking
proper
intervals
of
rest
and
refreshment
at
the
different
farms
they
passed
on
their
road
though
he
eager
to
press
on
chafed
and
fretted
at
every
little
delay
they
were
welcomed
all
along
their
route
with
true
norse
hospitality
though
the
good
who
entertained
them
could
not
refrain
from
astonishment
at
the
idea
of
their
having
undertaken
such
a
journey
at
such
a
season
and
appeared
to
doubt
the
possibility
of
their
reaching
their
destination
at
all
and
now
that
they
had
reached
it
in
safety
britta
strength
gave
way
valdemar
svensen
had
hastily
blurted
out
the
news
of
the
death
even
while
she
and
sir
philip
were
alighting
from
their
sledge
and
in
the
same
breath
had
told
them
of
dangerous
illness
what
wonder
then
that
britta
sobbed
hysterically
and
refused
to
be
comforted
what
wonder
that
she
turned
upon
ulrika
as
that
personage
approached
in
a
burst
of
unreasonable
anger
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
cried
to
think
that
the
fröken
should
be
so
ill
almost
dying
and
have
nobody
but
to
attend
to
her
this
with
a
vindictive
toss
of
the
brown
curls
ulrika
winced
at
her
words
she
was
hurt
but
she
answered
gently
i
have
done
my
best
she
said
with
a
sort
of
grave
pathos
i
have
been
with
her
night
and
day
had
she
been
a
daughter
of
my
own
blood
i
know
not
how
i
could
have
served
her
with
more
tenderness
and
surely
it
has
been
a
sore
and
anxious
time
with
me
also
for
i
too
have
learned
to
love
her
her
set
mouth
quivered
and
britta
seeing
her
emotion
was
ashamed
of
her
first
hasty
speech
she
made
an
act
of
contrition
at
once
by
putting
her
arms
round
ulrika
neck
and
kissing
her
a
proceeding
which
so
much
astonished
that
devout
servant
of
luther
that
her
dull
eyes
filled
with
tears
forgive
me
said
the
impetuous
little
maiden
i
was
very
rude
and
very
unkind
but
if
you
love
the
fröken
you
will
understand
how
i
feel
how
i
wish
i
could
have
helped
to
take
care
of
her
and
oh
the
here
she
gave
way
to
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
the
dear
good
kind
brave
that
he
should
be
dead
oh
it
is
too
cruel
too
dreadful
i
can
hardly
believe
it
ulrika
patted
her
consolingly
on
the
shoulder
but
said
nothing
and
valdemar
sighed
britta
sought
for
her
handkerchief
and
dried
her
eyes
but
after
a
minute
began
to
cry
again
as
recklessly
as
ever
and
now
she
gasped
if
the
fröken
dies
i
will
die
too
i
will
you
see
if
i
do
i
live
without
her
and
such
a
big
sob
broke
from
her
heaving
bosom
that
it
threatened
to
burst
her
trimly
laced
little
bodice
she
will
not
die
said
ulrika
decisively
i
have
had
my
fears
but
the
crisis
is
passed
do
not
fret
britta
there
is
no
longer
any
danger
her
husband
love
will
lift
the
trouble
from
her
heart
and
strength
will
return
more
speedily
than
it
left
her
and
turning
a
little
aside
on
the
pretence
of
throwing
more
wood
on
the
fire
she
muttered
inaudibly
o
lord
verily
thou
hast
done
well
to
grant
my
just
demand
even
for
this
will
i
remain
thy
servant
for
ever
after
this
parenthesis
she
resumed
the
conversation
valdemar
svensen
sitting
silently
apart
and
related
all
that
had
happened
since
thelma
arrival
at
the
altenfjord
she
also
gave
an
account
of
lovisa
elsland
death
though
britta
was
not
much
affected
by
the
loss
of
her
grandmother
dreadful
old
thing
she
said
with
a
shudder
i
glad
i
was
with
her
i
remember
how
she
cursed
the
fröken
perhaps
her
curse
has
brought
all
the
trouble
if
so
it
a
good
thing
she
dead
for
now
everything
will
come
right
again
i
used
to
fancy
she
had
some
crime
to
confess
did
she
say
anything
wicked
when
she
was
dying
ulrika
avoided
a
direct
reply
to
this
question
what
was
the
good
of
horrifying
the
girl
by
telling
her
that
her
deceased
relative
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
murderess
she
resolved
to
let
the
secret
of
old
lovisa
life
remain
buried
with
her
therefore
she
simply
answered
her
mind
wandered
greatly
it
was
difficult
to
hear
her
last
words
but
it
should
satisfy
you
britta
to
know
that
she
passed
away
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
britta
gave
a
little
smile
she
had
not
the
slightest
belief
in
the
sincerity
of
her
late
grandmother
religious
principles
i
do
understand
people
who
are
so
much
of
the
lord
she
said
they
must
have
done
something
wrong
if
you
always
do
your
best
and
try
to
be
good
you
need
fear
anything
at
least
that
my
opinion
there
is
the
everlasting
burning
began
ulrika
solemnly
oh
nonsense
exclaimed
britta
quite
impatiently
i
do
believe
it
ulrika
started
back
in
wonder
and
dismay
you
do
believe
it
she
said
in
awed
accents
are
you
also
a
heathen
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
a
heathen
replied
britta
almost
gaily
but
i
ca
believe
that
god
who
is
so
good
is
going
to
everlastingly
burn
anybody
he
could
you
know
it
would
hurt
him
so
much
to
see
poor
creatures
writhing
about
in
flames
for
ever
we
would
not
be
able
to
bear
it
and
i
quite
sure
it
would
make
him
miserable
even
in
heaven
because
he
is
all
love
he
says
so
he
could
be
cruel
this
frank
statement
of
britta
views
presented
such
a
new
form
of
doctrine
to
ulrika
heavy
mind
that
she
was
almost
appalled
by
it
god
burn
anybody
for
ever
he
was
too
good
what
a
daring
idea
and
yet
so
consoling
so
wonderful
in
the
infinite
prospect
of
hope
it
offered
that
she
smiled
even
while
she
trembled
to
contemplate
it
poor
soul
she
talked
of
heathens
being
herself
the
worst
type
of
heathen
namely
a
christian
heathen
this
sounds
incongruous
yet
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
those
who
profess
to
follow
christianity
and
yet
make
of
god
a
being
malicious
revengeful
and
of
more
evil
attributes
than
they
possess
themselves
are
as
barbarous
as
unenlightened
as
hopelessly
sunken
in
slavish
ignorance
as
the
lowest
savage
who
adores
his
idols
of
mud
and
stone
britta
was
quite
unconscious
of
having
said
anything
out
of
the
common
she
was
addressing
herself
to
svensen
where
is
the
buried
valdemar
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
he
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
mysterious
smile
buried
do
you
suppose
his
body
could
mix
itself
with
common
earth
no
he
sailed
away
britta
away
yonder
and
he
pointed
out
through
the
window
to
the
fjord
now
invisible
in
the
deep
darkness
britta
stared
at
him
with
roundly
opened
frightened
eyes
her
face
paled
sailed
away
you
must
be
dreaming
sailed
away
how
could
he
if
he
was
dead
valdemar
grew
suddenly
excited
i
tell
you
he
sailed
away
he
repeated
in
a
low
hoarse
whisper
where
is
his
ship
the
try
if
you
can
find
it
anywhere
on
sea
or
land
it
has
gone
and
he
has
gone
with
it
like
a
king
and
warrior
to
glory
joy
and
victory
glory
joy
victory
those
were
his
last
words
britta
retreated
and
caught
ulrika
by
the
arm
is
he
mad
she
asked
fearfully
valdemar
heard
her
and
rose
from
his
chair
a
pained
smile
on
his
face
i
am
not
mad
britta
he
said
gently
do
not
be
afraid
if
grief
for
my
master
could
have
turned
my
brain
i
had
been
mad
ere
this
but
i
have
all
my
wits
about
me
and
i
have
told
you
the
truth
he
paused
then
added
in
a
more
ordinary
tone
you
will
need
fresh
logs
of
pine
i
will
go
and
bring
them
in
and
he
went
out
britta
gazed
after
him
in
speechless
wonder
what
does
he
mean
she
asked
what
he
says
returned
ulrika
composedly
you
like
others
must
have
known
that
olaf
güldmar
creed
was
a
strange
one
his
burial
has
been
strange
that
is
all
and
she
skillfully
turned
the
conversation
and
began
to
talk
of
thelma
her
sorrows
and
sufferings
britta
was
most
impatient
to
see
her
beloved
fröken
and
quite
grudged
sir
philip
the
long
time
he
remained
alone
with
his
wife
he
call
me
if
only
for
a
moment
britta
thought
plaintively
i
do
so
want
to
look
at
her
dear
face
again
but
men
are
all
alike
as
long
as
they
got
what
want
they
never
think
of
anybody
else
dear
me
i
wonder
how
long
i
shall
have
to
wait
so
she
fumed
and
fretted
and
sat
by
the
drinking
hot
tea
and
talking
to
ulrika
all
the
while
straining
her
ears
for
the
least
sound
or
movement
from
the
adjoining
room
but
none
came
there
was
the
most
perfect
silence
at
last
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
regardless
of
ulrika
remonstrances
she
stole
on
to
the
closed
door
that
barred
her
from
the
sight
of
her
heart
idol
and
turning
the
handle
softly
opened
it
and
looked
in
sir
philip
saw
her
and
made
a
little
warning
sign
though
he
smiled
he
was
sitting
by
the
bedside
and
in
his
arms
nestled
against
his
shoulder
thelma
rested
she
was
fast
asleep
the
lines
of
pain
had
disappeared
from
her
sweet
face
a
smile
was
on
her
lips
her
breath
came
and
went
with
peaceful
regularity
and
the
delicate
hue
of
a
pale
rose
flushed
her
cheeks
britta
stood
gazing
on
this
fair
sight
till
her
affectionate
little
heart
overflowed
and
the
ready
tears
dropped
like
diamonds
from
her
curly
lashes
oh
my
dear
my
dear
she
whispered
in
a
sort
of
rapture
when
there
was
a
gentle
movement
and
two
eyes
opened
like
blue
flowers
outspreading
to
the
sun
is
that
you
britta
asked
a
tender
wondering
voice
and
with
a
smothered
cry
of
ecstacy
britta
sprang
to
seize
the
outstretched
hand
of
her
beloved
fröken
and
cover
it
with
kisses
and
while
thelma
laughed
with
pleasure
to
see
her
and
stroked
her
hair
sir
philip
described
their
long
drive
through
the
snow
and
so
warmly
praised
britta
patience
endurance
and
constant
cheerfulness
that
his
voice
trembled
with
its
own
earnestness
while
britta
grew
rosily
red
in
her
deep
shyness
and
embarrassment
vehemently
protesting
that
she
had
done
nothing
nothing
at
all
to
deserve
so
much
commendation
then
after
much
glad
converse
ulrika
was
called
and
sir
philip
seizing
her
hand
shook
it
with
such
force
and
fervor
that
she
was
quite
overcome
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
he
said
his
eyes
sparkling
with
gratitude
it
impossible
to
repay
such
goodness
as
yours
my
wife
tells
me
how
tender
and
patient
and
devoted
you
have
been
that
even
when
she
knew
nothing
else
she
was
aware
of
your
kindness
god
bless
you
for
it
you
have
saved
her
life
ah
yes
indeed
interrupted
thelma
gently
and
life
has
grown
so
glad
for
me
again
i
do
owe
you
so
much
you
owe
me
nothing
said
ulrika
in
those
harsh
monotonous
tones
which
she
had
of
late
learned
to
modulate
nothing
the
debt
is
all
on
my
side
she
stopped
abruptly
a
dull
red
color
flushed
her
face
her
eyes
dwelt
on
thelma
with
a
musing
tenderness
sir
philip
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
yes
she
went
on
the
debt
is
all
on
my
side
hear
me
out
sir
philip
and
you
too
you
of
the
northern
forest
as
sigurd
used
to
call
you
you
have
not
forgotten
sigurd
forgotten
him
said
thelma
softly
never
i
loved
him
too
well
ulrika
head
dropped
he
was
my
son
she
said
there
was
a
silence
of
complete
astonishment
ulrika
paused
then
as
no
one
uttered
a
word
she
looked
up
boldly
and
spoke
with
a
sort
of
desperate
determination
you
see
you
have
nothing
to
thank
me
for
she
went
on
addressing
herself
to
sir
philip
while
thelma
leaning
back
on
her
pillows
and
holding
britta
hand
regarded
her
with
a
new
and
amazed
interest
perhaps
if
you
had
known
what
sort
of
a
woman
i
am
you
might
not
have
liked
me
to
come
near
and
she
motioned
towards
thelma
when
i
was
young
long
ago
i
loved
she
laughed
bitterly
it
seems
a
strange
thing
to
say
does
it
not
let
it
pass
the
story
of
my
love
my
sin
and
shame
need
not
be
told
here
but
sigurd
was
my
child
born
in
an
evil
hour
and
i
i
strove
to
kill
him
at
his
birth
thelma
uttered
a
faint
cry
of
horror
ulrika
turned
an
imploring
gaze
upon
her
do
hate
me
she
said
her
voice
trembling
do
for
god
sake
hate
me
you
do
know
what
i
have
suffered
i
was
mad
i
think
at
the
time
i
flung
the
child
in
the
fjord
to
drown
your
father
olaf
güldmar
rescued
him
i
never
knew
that
till
long
after
for
years
the
crime
i
had
committed
weighed
upon
my
soul
i
prayed
and
strove
with
the
lord
for
pardon
but
always
always
felt
that
for
me
there
was
no
forgiveness
lovisa
elsland
used
to
call
me
murderess
she
was
right
i
was
one
or
so
i
thought
till
till
that
day
i
met
you
fröken
thelma
on
the
hills
with
sigurd
and
the
lad
fought
with
me
she
shuddered
and
her
eyes
looked
wild
i
recognized
him
no
matter
how
he
bore
my
mark
upon
him
he
was
my
son
the
deformed
crazy
creature
who
yet
had
wit
enough
to
love
you
whom
then
i
hated
but
now
she
stopped
and
advanced
a
little
closer
to
thelma
bedside
now
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
you
my
dear
she
said
very
gently
but
you
will
not
need
me
any
more
you
understand
what
you
have
done
for
me
you
and
your
father
you
have
saved
me
by
saving
sigurd
saved
from
being
weighed
down
to
hell
with
the
crime
of
murder
and
you
made
the
boy
happy
while
he
lived
all
the
rest
of
my
days
spent
in
your
service
could
not
pay
back
the
worth
of
that
good
deed
and
most
heartily
do
i
thank
the
lord
that
he
has
mercifully
permitted
me
to
tend
and
comfort
you
in
the
hour
of
trouble
and
moreover
that
he
has
given
me
strength
to
speak
and
confess
my
sin
and
unworthiness
before
you
ere
i
depart
for
now
the
trouble
is
past
i
must
remove
my
shadow
from
your
joy
god
bless
you
and
try
to
think
as
kindly
as
you
can
of
me
for
for
sigurd
sake
stooping
she
kissed
thelma
hand
and
before
any
one
had
time
to
speak
a
word
she
left
the
room
abruptly
when
in
a
few
minutes
britta
went
to
look
after
her
she
was
gone
she
had
departed
to
her
own
house
in
bosekop
where
she
obstinately
remained
nothing
would
induce
her
to
present
herself
again
before
sir
philip
or
thelma
and
it
was
not
till
many
days
after
they
had
left
the
altenfjord
that
she
was
once
more
seen
about
the
village
and
then
she
was
a
changed
being
no
longer
harsh
or
forbidding
in
manner
she
became
humble
and
gentle
she
ministered
to
the
sick
and
consoled
the
afflicted
but
she
was
especially
famous
for
her
love
of
children
all
the
little
ones
of
the
place
knew
her
and
were
attracted
by
her
and
the
time
came
when
ulrika
and
of
peaceful
countenance
could
be
seen
knitting
at
her
door
in
the
long
summer
afternoons
surrounded
by
a
whole
army
of
laughing
chattering
dimpled
youngsters
who
would
play
at
behind
her
chair
and
clamber
up
to
kiss
her
wrinkled
cheeks
putting
their
chubby
arms
round
her
neck
with
that
guileless
confidence
children
show
only
to
those
whom
they
feel
can
appreciate
such
flattering
attentions
some
of
her
acquaintance
were
wont
to
say
that
she
was
no
longer
the
godly
ulrika
but
however
this
might
be
it
is
certain
she
had
drifted
a
little
nearer
to
the
author
of
all
godliness
which
after
all
is
the
most
we
dare
to
strive
for
in
all
our
differing
creeds
it
was
not
long
before
thelma
began
to
recover
the
day
after
her
husband
arrived
and
ulrika
departed
she
rose
from
her
bed
with
britta
assistance
and
sat
by
the
blazing
fire
wrapped
in
her
white
gown
and
looking
very
fragile
though
very
lovely
philip
had
been
talking
to
her
for
some
time
and
now
he
sat
at
her
feet
holding
her
hand
in
his
and
watching
her
face
on
which
there
was
an
expression
of
the
most
plaintive
and
serious
penitence
i
have
been
very
wicked
she
said
with
such
a
quaint
horror
of
herself
that
her
husband
laughed
now
i
look
back
upon
it
all
i
think
i
have
behaved
so
very
badly
because
i
ought
never
to
have
doubted
you
my
boy
no
not
for
all
the
lady
winsleighs
in
the
world
and
poor
neville
he
must
be
so
unhappy
but
it
was
that
letter
that
letter
in
your
own
writing
philip
of
course
he
answered
soothingly
no
wonder
you
thought
me
a
dreadful
fellow
but
you
wo
do
so
again
will
you
thelma
you
will
believe
that
you
are
the
crown
and
centre
of
my
life
the
joy
of
all
the
world
to
me
yes
i
will
she
said
softly
and
proudly
though
it
is
always
the
same
i
never
do
think
myself
worthy
but
i
must
try
to
grow
very
conceited
and
assure
myself
that
i
am
very
valuable
so
that
then
i
shall
understand
everything
better
and
be
wiser
philip
laughed
talking
of
letters
he
said
suddenly
here
one
i
wrote
to
you
from
hull
it
only
got
here
today
where
it
has
been
delayed
is
a
mystery
you
need
read
it
you
know
everything
in
it
already
then
there
a
letter
on
the
shelf
up
there
addressed
in
your
writing
it
seems
never
to
have
been
opened
he
reached
it
down
and
gave
it
to
her
as
she
took
it
her
face
grew
very
sad
it
is
the
one
i
wrote
to
my
father
before
i
left
london
she
said
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
came
too
late
thelma
said
sir
philip
then
very
gently
and
gravely
would
you
like
can
you
bear
to
read
your
father
last
words
to
you
he
wrote
to
you
on
his
and
gave
the
letter
to
valdemar
oh
let
me
see
it
she
murmured
father
dear
father
i
knew
he
would
not
leave
me
without
a
word
sir
philip
reverently
opened
the
folded
paper
which
svensen
had
committed
to
his
care
that
morning
and
together
they
read
the
farewell
it
ran
as
follows
thelma
my
beloved
the
summons
i
have
waited
for
has
come
at
last
and
the
doors
of
valhalla
are
set
open
to
receive
my
soul
wonder
not
that
i
depart
with
joy
old
as
i
am
i
long
for
youth
the
everlasting
youth
of
which
the
strength
and
savor
fails
not
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
know
the
sameness
of
this
world
though
there
is
much
therein
to
please
the
heart
and
eye
of
a
man
but
with
that
roving
restlessness
that
was
born
within
me
i
desire
to
sail
new
seas
and
gaze
on
new
lands
where
a
perpetual
light
shines
that
knows
no
fading
grieve
not
for
me
thou
wilt
remember
that
unlike
a
christian
i
see
in
death
the
chiefest
glory
of
life
and
thou
must
not
regret
that
i
am
eager
to
drain
this
cup
of
offered
by
the
gods
i
leave
thee
not
sorrowfully
for
thou
art
in
shelter
and
safety
the
strong
protection
of
thy
husband
love
defends
thee
and
the
safeguard
of
thine
own
innocence
my
blessing
upon
him
and
thee
serve
him
thelma
mine
with
full
devotion
and
obedience
even
as
i
have
taught
thee
thus
drawing
from
thy
womanlife
its
best
measure
of
sweetness
keep
the
bright
shield
of
thy
truth
untarnished
and
live
so
that
at
the
hour
of
thine
own
thou
mayest
depart
as
easily
as
a
soaring
to
the
sun
i
pass
hence
in
happiness
if
thou
dost
shed
a
tear
thou
wrongest
my
memory
there
is
naught
to
weep
for
valdemar
will
give
me
the
crimson
shroud
and
ocean
grave
of
my
ancestors
but
question
him
not
concerning
this
fiery
pomp
of
my
last
voyage
he
is
but
a
serf
and
his
soul
is
shaken
to
its
very
depths
by
sorrow
let
him
be
he
will
have
his
reward
hereafter
and
now
farewell
child
of
my
heart
darling
of
mine
age
clear
mirror
in
which
my
later
life
has
brightened
to
content
all
partings
are
brief
we
shall
meet
again
thou
and
i
and
philip
and
all
who
have
loved
or
who
love
each
other
the
journey
heavenwards
may
be
made
by
different
roads
but
the
end
the
glory
the
immortality
is
the
same
peace
be
upon
thee
and
on
thy
children
and
on
thy
children
children
thy
father
olaf
güldmar
in
spite
of
the
brave
old
pagan
declaration
that
tears
would
wrong
his
memory
they
dropped
bright
and
fast
from
his
daughter
eyes
as
she
kissed
again
and
again
the
words
his
dying
hand
had
pencilled
while
errington
knew
not
which
feeling
gained
the
greater
mastery
over
him
grief
for
a
good
man
loss
or
admiration
for
the
strong
heroic
spirit
in
which
that
good
man
had
welcomed
death
with
rejoicing
he
could
not
help
comparing
the
departure
from
this
life
with
that
of
sir
francis
lennox
the
man
of
false
fashion
who
had
let
slip
his
withered
soul
with
an
oath
into
the
land
of
nowhere
presently
thelma
grew
calmer
and
began
to
speak
in
hushed
soft
tones
poor
valdemar
she
said
meditatively
his
heart
must
ache
very
much
philip
philip
looked
up
inquiringly
you
see
my
father
speaks
of
the
shroud
she
went
on
that
means
that
he
was
buried
like
many
of
the
ancient
norwegian
sea
kings
he
was
taken
from
his
bed
while
dying
and
placed
on
board
his
own
ship
to
breathe
his
last
then
the
ship
was
set
on
fire
and
sent
out
to
sea
i
always
knew
he
wished
it
so
valdemar
must
have
done
it
all
for
i
i
saw
the
last
glimpse
of
the
flames
on
the
fjord
the
night
i
came
home
oh
philip
and
her
beautiful
eyes
rested
tenderly
upon
him
it
was
all
so
dreadful
so
desolate
i
wanted
i
prayed
to
die
also
the
world
was
so
empty
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
nothing
left
philip
still
sitting
at
her
feet
encircled
her
with
both
arms
and
drew
her
down
to
him
my
thelma
he
whispered
there
nothing
left
nothing
at
all
worth
living
for
save
love
ah
but
that
she
answered
softly
is
everything
is
it
so
indeed
is
love
alone
worth
living
for
worth
dying
for
is
it
the
only
satisfying
good
we
can
grasp
at
among
the
shifting
shadows
of
our
brief
existence
in
its
various
phases
and
different
workings
is
it
after
all
the
brightest
radiance
known
in
the
struggling
darkness
of
our
lives
sigurd
had
thought
so
he
had
died
to
prove
it
philip
thought
so
when
once
more
at
home
in
england
with
his
recovered
treasure
of
the
golden
midnight
he
saw
her
like
a
rose
refreshed
by
rain
raise
her
bright
head
in
renewed
strength
and
beauty
with
the
old
joyous
lustre
dancing
in
her
eyes
and
the
smile
of
a
perfect
happiness
like
summer
sunshine
on
her
fair
face
lord
winsleigh
thought
so
he
was
spending
the
winter
in
rome
with
his
wife
and
son
and
there
among
the
shadows
of
the
caesars
his
long
social
martyrdom
ended
and
he
regained
what
he
had
once
believed
lost
for
ever
his
wife
affection
clara
gentle
wistful
with
the
softening
shadow
of
a
great
sorrow
and
a
great
repentance
in
her
once
eyes
was
a
very
different
clara
to
the
dashing
beauty
who
had
figured
so
conspicuously
in
london
society
she
clung
to
her
husband
with
an
almost
timid
eagerness
as
though
she
dreaded
losing
him
and
when
he
was
not
with
her
she
seemed
to
rely
entirely
on
her
son
whom
she
watched
with
a
fond
almost
melancholy
pride
and
who
responded
to
her
tenderness
though
proffered
so
late
with
the
frankness
of
his
impulsive
ardent
nature
she
wrote
to
thelma
asking
her
pardon
and
in
return
received
such
a
sweet
forgiving
generous
letter
as
caused
her
to
weep
for
an
hour
or
more
but
she
felt
she
could
never
again
meet
the
clear
regard
of
those
beautiful
earnest
truthful
eyes
never
again
could
she
stand
in
thelma
presence
or
call
her
friend
that
was
all
over
still
love
remained
a
love
chastened
and
sad
with
drooping
wings
and
a
somewhat
doubting
smile
yet
it
was
love
love
that
keeps
all
the
choir
of
lives
in
chime
love
that
is
blood
within
the
veins
of
time
and
love
no
matter
how
abused
and
maltreated
is
a
very
patient
god
and
even
while
suffering
from
undeserved
wounds
still
works
on
doing
magical
things
so
that
poor
edward
neville
the
forsaken
husband
of
violet
vere
when
he
heard
that
that
popular
actress
had
died
suddenly
in
america
from
a
fit
of
delirium
tremens
brought
on
by
excessive
drinking
was
able
by
some
gentle
method
known
only
to
love
and
himself
to
forget
all
her
frailties
to
obliterate
from
his
memory
the
fact
that
he
ever
saw
her
on
the
boards
of
the
brilliant
theatre
and
to
think
of
her
henceforth
only
as
the
wife
he
had
once
adored
and
who
he
decided
in
vague
dreamy
fashion
must
have
died
young
love
also
laid
a
firm
hand
on
the
vivacious
pierre
duprèz
he
who
had
long
scoffed
at
the
played
it
at
last
in
grave
earnest
and
one
bright
season
he
introduced
his
bride
into
parisian
society
a
charming
little
woman
with
very
sparkling
eyes
and
white
teeth
who
spoke
french
perfectly
though
not
with
the
recommended
by
briggs
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
britta
in
the
who
laughed
and
danced
and
chattered
her
way
through
some
of
the
best
in
paris
captivating
everybody
as
she
went
but
there
she
was
all
the
same
holding
her
own
as
usual
her
husband
was
extremely
proud
of
her
he
was
fond
of
pointing
her
out
to
people
as
something
excessively
precious
and
unique
and
saying
see
her
that
is
my
wife
from
norway
yes
from
the
very
utmost
north
of
norway
i
love
my
country
certainly
but
i
will
tell
you
this
much
if
i
had
been
obliged
to
choose
a
wife
among
french
women
foi
i
should
never
have
married
and
what
of
george
lorimer
the
idle
somewhat
careless
man
of
modern
type
in
whose
heart
notwithstanding
the
supposed
deterioration
of
the
age
all
the
best
and
bravest
codes
of
chivalry
were
written
had
love
no
fair
thing
to
offer
was
he
destined
to
live
out
his
life
in
the
silent
heroism
of
faithful
unuttered
unrequited
unselfish
devotion
were
the
heavens
as
sigurd
had
said
always
to
be
empty
apparently
not
for
when
he
was
verging
towards
middle
age
a
young
lady
besieged
him
with
her
affections
and
boldly
offered
to
be
his
wife
any
day
he
chose
to
name
she
was
a
small
person
not
quite
five
years
old
with
great
blue
eyes
and
a
glittering
tangle
of
golden
curls
she
made
her
proposal
one
summer
afternoon
on
the
lawn
at
errington
manor
in
the
presence
of
beau
lovelace
on
whose
knee
sat
her
little
brother
olaf
a
fine
boy
a
year
younger
than
herself
she
had
placed
her
dimpled
arms
round
lorimer
neck
and
when
she
so
confidingly
suggested
marriage
to
her
zordie
as
she
called
him
she
was
rubbing
her
rosy
velvety
cheek
against
his
moustache
with
much
sweet
consideration
and
tenderness
lovelace
hearing
her
laughed
aloud
whereat
the
little
lady
was
extremely
offended
i
do
tare
she
said
with
pretty
defiance
i
do
love
oo
zordie
and
i
will
marry
oo
george
held
her
fondly
to
his
breast
as
though
she
were
some
precious
fragile
flower
of
which
not
a
petal
must
be
injured
all
right
he
answered
gaily
though
his
voice
trembled
somewhat
i
accept
you
shall
be
my
little
wife
thelma
consider
it
settled
apparently
she
did
so
consider
it
for
from
that
day
whenever
she
was
asked
her
name
she
announced
herself
proudly
as
zordie
wife
thelma
to
the
great
amusement
of
her
father
sir
philip
and
that
other
thelma
on
whom
the
glory
of
motherhood
had
fallen
like
a
new
charm
investing
both
face
and
form
with
superior
beauty
and
an
almost
divine
serenity
but
zordie
wife
took
her
very
seriously
so
much
so
indeed
that
zordie
began
to
take
it
rather
seriously
himself
and
to
wonder
whether
after
all
marriages
unequal
in
point
of
age
might
not
occasionally
turn
out
well
he
condemned
himself
severely
for
the
romanticism
of
thinking
such
thoughts
even
while
he
indulged
in
them
and
called
himself
an
old
fool
though
he
was
in
the
actual
prime
of
manhood
and
an
exceedingly
handsome
fellow
withal
but
when
the
younger
thelma
came
back
at
the
age
of
sixteen
from
her
convent
school
at
arles
the
same
school
where
her
mother
had
been
before
her
she
looked
so
like
her
mother
so
very
like
that
his
heart
began
to
ache
with
the
old
wistful
passionate
longing
he
fancied
he
had
stilled
for
ever
he
struggled
against
this
feeling
for
a
while
till
at
last
it
became
too
strong
for
him
and
then
though
he
told
himself
it
was
absurd
that
a
man
past
forty
had
no
right
to
expect
to
win
a
girl
first
love
he
grew
so
reckless
that
he
determined
to
risk
his
fate
with
her
one
day
therefore
he
spoke
out
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
and
only
conscious
that
his
pulses
were
beating
with
abnormal
rapidity
she
listened
to
his
tremulous
rather
hesitating
proposal
with
exceeding
gravity
and
appeared
more
surprised
than
displeased
raising
her
glorious
blue
eyes
eyes
in
which
her
noble
fearless
look
was
faithfully
reflected
she
said
simply
just
in
her
mother
own
quaint
way
i
do
not
know
why
you
talk
about
this
at
all
i
thought
it
was
all
settled
long
ago
settled
faltered
lorimer
astonished
he
was
generally
but
this
fair
young
lady
perfect
equanimity
far
surpassed
his
at
that
moment
settled
my
darling
my
child
i
am
so
much
older
than
you
are
i
do
like
she
declared
with
stately
disdain
i
was
your
wife
when
i
was
little
and
i
thought
it
was
to
be
the
same
thing
now
i
am
big
i
told
mother
so
and
she
was
quite
pleased
but
of
course
if
you
do
want
me
she
was
not
allowed
to
finish
her
sentence
for
lorimer
with
a
sudden
rush
of
joy
that
almost
overpowered
him
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
the
first
lover
kiss
on
her
pure
innocently
smiling
lips
want
you
he
murmured
passionately
with
a
strange
sweet
mingling
of
the
past
and
present
in
his
words
i
have
always
wanted
thelma
