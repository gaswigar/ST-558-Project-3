i
m
of
age
quite
an
important
day
in
my
life
isn
t
it
that
is
why
i
am
giving
this
party
do
sit
down
arranging
lord
darlington
i
wish
i
had

the
whole
street
in
front
of
your
house
with
flowers
for

on
they
are
made
for
you
short
lady
windermere
lord
darlington
you
annoyed
me
last
night
at
the
foreign
office
i
am
afraid
you
are
going
to
annoy
me
again
lord
darlington
i
lady
windermere
parker
footman
tray
and
tea
lady
windermere
put
it
there
parker
that
will
do
her
hands
with
her
to
sits
won
t
you
come
over
lord
darlington
parker
lord
darlington
chair
and
goes
across
i
am
quite
miserable
lady
windermere
you
must
tell
me
what
i
did
down
at
table
lady
windermere
well
you
kept
paying
me
elaborate
compliments
the
whole
evening
lord
darlington
ah
nowadays
we
are
all
of
us
so
hard
up
that
the
only
pleasant
things
to
pay
compliments
they
re
the
only
things
we
pay
lady
windermere
her
no
i
am
talking
very
seriously
you
mustn
t
laugh
i
am
quite
serious
i
don
t
like
compliments
and
i
don
t
see
why
a
man
should
think
he
is
pleasing
a
woman
enormously
when
he
says
to
her
a
whole
heap
of
things
that
he
doesn
t
mean
lord
darlington
ah
but
i
did
mean
them
tea
which
she
offers
lady
windermere
i
hope
not
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
quarrel
with
you
lord
darlington
i
like
you
very
much
you
know
that
but
i
shouldn
t
like
you
at
all
if
i
thought
you
were
what
most
other
men
are
believe
me
you
are
better
than
most
other
men
and
i
sometimes
think
you
pretend
to
be
worse
lord
darlington
we
all
have
our
little
vanities
lady
windermere
lady
windermere
why
do
you
make
that
your
special
one
seated
at
table
lord
darlington
seated
oh
nowadays
so
many
conceited
people
go
about
society
pretending
to
be
good
that
i
think
it
shows
rather
a
sweet
and
modest
disposition
to
pretend
to
be
bad
besides
there
is
this
to
be
said
if
you
pretend
to
be
good
the
world
takes
you
very
seriously
if
you
pretend
to
be
bad
it
doesn
t
such
is
the
astounding
stupidity
of
optimism
lady
windermere
don
t
you
the
world
to
take
you
seriously
then
lord
darlington
lord
darlington
no
not
the
world
who
are
the
people
the
world
takes
seriously
all
the
dull
people
one
can
think
of
from
the
bishops
down
to
the
bores
i
should
like
to
take
me
very
seriously
lady
windermere
more
than
any
one
else
in
life
lady
windermere
me
lord
darlington
a
slight
because
i
think
we
might
be
great
friends
let
us
be
great
friends
you
may
want
a
friend
some
day
lady
windermere
why
do
you
say
that
lord
darlington
oh
all
want
friends
at
times
lady
windermere
i
think
we
re
very
good
friends
already
lord
darlington
we
can
always
remain
so
as
long
as
you
don
lord
darlington
don
t
what
lady
windermere
don
t
spoil
it
by
saying
extravagant
silly
things
to
me
you
think
i
am
a
puritan
i
suppose
well
i
have
something
of
the
puritan
in
me
i
was
brought
up
like
that
i
am
glad
of
it
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
mere
child
i
lived
always
with
lady
julia
my
father
s
elder
sister
you
know
she
was
stern
to
me
but
she
taught
me
what
the
world
is
forgetting
the
difference
that
there
is
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
allowed
of
no
compromise
allow
of
none
lord
darlington
my
dear
lady
windermere
lady
windermere
back
on
the
you
look
on
me
as
being
behind
the
i
am
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
on
the
same
level
as
an
age
like
this
lord
darlington
you
think
the
age
very
bad
lady
windermere
yes
nowadays
people
seem
to
look
on
life
as
a
speculation
it
is
not
a
speculation
it
is
a
sacrament
its
ideal
is
love
its
purification
is
sacrifice
lord
darlington
oh
anything
is
better
than
being
sacrificed
lady
windermere
don
t
say
that
lord
darlington
i
do
say
it
i
feel
know
it
parker
parker
the
men
want
to
know
if
they
are
to
put
the
carpets
on
the
terrace
for
my
lady
lady
windermere
you
don
t
think
it
will
rain
lord
darlington
do
you
lord
darlington
i
won
t
hear
of
its
raining
on
your
birthday
lady
windermere
tell
them
to
do
it
at
once
parker
parker
lord
darlington
do
you
think
course
i
am
only
putting
an
imaginary
you
think
that
in
the
case
of
a
young
married
couple
say
about
two
years
married
if
the
husband
suddenly
becomes
the
intimate
friend
of
a
woman
more
than
doubtful
always
calling
upon
her
lunching
with
her
and
probably
paying
her
you
think
that
the
wife
should
not
console
herself
lady
windermere
console
herself
lord
darlington
yes
i
think
she
think
she
has
the
right
lady
windermere
because
the
husband
is
the
wife
be
vile
also
lord
darlington
vileness
is
a
terrible
word
lady
windermere
lady
windermere
it
is
a
terrible
thing
lord
darlington
lord
darlington
do
you
know
i
am
afraid
that
good
people
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
in
this
world
certainly
the
greatest
harm
they
do
is
that
they
make
badness
of
such
extraordinary
importance
it
is
absurd
to
divide
people
into
good
and
bad
people
are
either
charming
or
tedious
i
take
the
side
of
the
charming
and
you
lady
windermere
can
t
help
belonging
to
them
lady
windermere
now
lord
darlington
and
crossing
of
don
t
stir
i
am
merely
going
to
finish
my
flowers
to
table
lord
darlington
and
moving
and
i
must
say
i
think
you
are
very
hard
on
modern
life
lady
windermere
of
course
there
is
much
against
it
i
admit
most
women
for
instance
nowadays
are
rather
mercenary
lady
windermere
don
t
talk
about
such
people
lord
darlington
well
then
setting
aside
mercenary
people
who
of
course
are
dreadful
do
you
think
seriously
that
women
who
have
committed
what
the
world
calls
a
fault
should
never
be
forgiven
lady
windermere
at
i
think
they
should
never
be
forgiven
lord
darlington
and
men
do
you
think
that
there
should
be
the
same
laws
for
men
as
there
are
for
women
lady
windermere
certainly
lord
darlington
i
think
life
too
complex
a
thing
to
be
settled
by
these
hard
and
fast
rules
lady
windermere
if
we
had
these
hard
and
fast
rules
we
should
find
life
much
more
simple
lord
darlington
you
allow
of
no
exceptions
lady
windermere
none
lord
darlington
ah
what
a
fascinating
puritan
you
are
lady
windermere
lady
windermere
the
adjective
was
unnecessary
lord
darlington
lord
darlington
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
can
resist
everything
except
temptation
lady
windermere
you
have
the
modern
affectation
of
weakness
lord
darlington
at
it
s
only
an
affectation
lady
windermere
parker
parker
the
duchess
of
berwick
and
lady
agatha
carlisle
duchess
of
berwick
and
lady
agatha
carlisle
parker
duchess
of
berwick
down
shaking
dear
margaret
i
am
so
pleased
to
see
you
you
remember
agatha

t
you
how
do
you
do
lord
darlington
i
won
t
let
you
know
my
daughter
you
are
far
too
wicked
lord
darlington
don
t
say
that
duchess
as
a
wicked
man
i
am
a
complete
failure
why
there
are
lots
of
people
who
say
i
have
never
really
done
anything
wrong
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
of
course
they
only
say
it
behind
my
back
duchess
of
berwick
isn
t
he
dreadful
agatha
this
is
lord
darlington
mind
you
don
t
believe
a
word
he
says
lord
darlington
no
no
tea
thank
you
dear
and
sits
on
we
have
just
had
tea
at
lady
markby
s
such
bad
tea
too
it
was
quite
undrinkable
i
wasn
t
at
all
surprised
her
own
supplies
it
agatha
is
looking
forward
so
much
to
your
ball
dear
margaret
lady
windermere
oh
you
mustn
t
think
it
is
going
to
be
a
ball
duchess
it
is
only
a
dance
in
honour
of
my
birthday
a
small
and
early
lord
darlington
very
small
very
early
and
very
select
duchess
duchess
of
berwick
sofa
of
course
it
s
going
to
be
select
but
we
know
dear
margaret
about
house
it
is
really
one
of
the
few
houses
in
london
where
i
can
take
agatha
and
where
i
feel
perfectly
secure
about
dear
berwick
i
don
t
know
what
society
is
coming
to
the
most
dreadful
people
seem
to
go
everywhere
they
certainly
come
to
my
men
get
quite
furious
if
one
doesn
t
ask
them
really
some
one
should
make
a
stand
against
it
lady
windermere
will
duchess
i
will
have
no
one
in
my
house
about
whom
there
is
any
scandal
lord
darlington
oh
don
t
say
that
lady
windermere
i
should
never
be
admitted
duchess
of
berwick
oh
men
don
t
matter
with
women
it
is
different
we
re
good
some
of
us
are
at
least
but
we
are
positively
getting
elbowed
into
the
corner
our
husbands
would
really
forget
our
existence
if
we
didn
t
nag
at
them
from
time
to
time
just
to
remind
them
that
we
have
a
perfect
legal
right
to
do
so
lord
darlington
it
s
a
curious
thing
duchess
about
the
game
of
game
by
the
way
that
is
going
out
of
wives
hold
all
the
honours
and
invariably
lose
the
odd
trick
duchess
of
berwick
the
odd
trick
is
that
the
husband
lord
darlington
lord
darlington
it
would
be
rather
a
good
name
for
the
modern
husband
duchess
of
berwick
dear
lord
darlington
how
thoroughly
depraved
you
are
lady
windermere
lord
darlington
is
trivial
lord
darlington
ah
don
t
say
that
lady
windermere
lady
windermere
why
do
you
so
trivially
about
life
then
lord
darlington
because
i
think
that
life
is
far
too
important
a
thing
ever
to
talk
seriously
about
it
up
duchess
of
berwick
what
does
he
mean
do
as
a
concession
to
my
poor
wits
lord
darlington
just
explain
to
me
what
you
really
mean
lord
darlington
down
back
of
i
think
i
had
better
not
duchess
nowadays
to
be
intelligible
is
to
be
found
out
hands
duchess
and
up
lady
windermere
i
may
come
mayn
t
i
do
let
me
come
lady
windermere
up
stage
lord
darlington
yes
certainly
but
you
are
not
to
say
foolish
insincere
things
to
people
lord
darlington
ah
you
are
beginning
to
reform
me
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
reform
any
one
lady
windermere
exit
duchess
of
berwick
has
what
a
charming
wicked
creature
i
like
him
so
much
i
m
quite
delighted
he
s
gone
how
sweet
you
re
looking
where
you
get
your
gowns
and
now
i
must
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
for
you
dear
margaret
to
sofa
and
sits
lady
windermere
agatha
darling
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
duchess
of
berwick

you
go
and
look
over
the
photograph
album
that
i
see
there
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
to
table
up
duchess
of
berwick
dear
girl
she
is
so
fond
of
photographs
of
switzerland
such
a
pure
taste
i
think
but
i
really
am
so
sorry
for
you
margaret
lady
windermere
why
duchess
duchess
of
berwick
oh
on
account
of
that
horrid
woman
she
dresses
so
well
too
which
makes
it
much
worse
sets
such
a
dreadful
example
know
my
disreputable
a
trial
to
us
augustus
is
completely
infatuated
about
her
it
is
quite
scandalous
for
she
is
absolutely
inadmissible
into
society
many
a
woman
has
a
past
but
i
am
told
that
she
has
at
least
a
dozen
and
that
they
all
fit
lady
windermere
whom
are
you
talking
about
duchess
duchess
of
berwick
about
erlynne
lady
windermere
erlynne
i
never
heard
of
her
duchess
and
what
she
to
do
with
me
duchess
of
berwick
my
poor
child
agatha
darling
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
duchess
of
berwick
will
you
go
out
on
the
terrace
and
look
at
the
sunset
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
through
duchess
of
berwick
sweet
girl
so
devoted
to
sunsets
shows
such
refinement
of
feeling
does
it
not
after
all
there
is
nothing
like
nature
is
there
lady
windermere
but
what
is
it
duchess
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
this
person
duchess
of
berwick
don
t
you
really
know
i
assure
you
we
re
all
so
distressed
about
it
only
last
night
at
dear
lady
jansen
s
every
one
was
saying
how
extraordinary
it
was
that
of
all
men
in
london
windermere
should
behave
in
such
a
way
lady
windermere
my
has
got
to
do
with
any
woman
of
that
kind
duchess
of
berwick
ah
what
indeed
dear
that
is
the
point
he
goes
to
see
her
continually
and
stops
for
hours
at
a
time
and
while
he
is
there
she
is
not
at
home
to
any
one
not
that
many
ladies
call
on
her
dear
but
she
has
a
great
many
disreputable
men
own
brother
particularly
as
i
told
that
is
what
makes
it
so
dreadful
about
windermere
we
looked
upon
as
being
such
a
model
husband
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
my
dear
know
the
saville
girls
don
t
you
nice
domestic
dreadfully
plain
but
so
they
re
always
at
the
window
doing
fancy
work
and
making
ugly
things
for
the
poor
which
i
think
so
useful
of
them
in
these
dreadful
socialistic
days
and
this
terrible
woman
has
taken
a
house
in
curzon
street
right
opposite
a
respectable
street
too
i
don
t
know
what
we
re
coming
to
and
they
tell
me
that
windermere
goes
there
four
and
five
times
a
him
they
can
t
help
although
they
never
talk
scandal
of
remark
on
it
to
every
one
and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
i
have
been
told
that
this
woman
has
got
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
somebody
for
it
seems
that
she
came
to
london
six
months
ago
without
anything
at
all
to
speak
of
and
now
she
has
this
charming
house
in
mayfair
drives
her
ponies
in
the
park
every
afternoon
and
she
has
known
poor
dear
windermere
lady
windermere
oh
i
can
t
believe
it
duchess
of
berwick
but
it
s
quite
true
my
dear
the
whole
of
london
knows
it
that
is
why
i
felt
it
was
better
to
come
and
talk
to
you
and
advise
you
to
take
windermere
away
at
once
to
homburg
or
to
aix
where
he
ll
have
something
to
amuse
him
and
where
you
can
watch
him
all
day
long
i
assure
you
my
dear
that
on
several
occasions
after
i
was
first
married
i
had
to
pretend
to
be
very
ill
and
was
obliged
to
drink
the
most
unpleasant
mineral
waters
merely
to
get
berwick
out
of
town
he
was
so
extremely
susceptible
though
i
am
bound
to
say
he
never
gave
away
any
large
sums
of
money
to
anybody
he
is
far
too
for
that
lady
windermere
duchess
duchess
it
s
impossible
and
crossing
stage
to
we
are
only
married
two
years
our
child
is
but
six
months
old
in
chair
of
l
duchess
of
berwick
ah
the
dear
pretty
baby
how
is
the
little
darling
is
it
a
boy
or
a
girl
i
hope
a
no
i
remember
it
s
a
boy
i
m
so
sorry
boys
are
so
wicked
my
boy
is
excessively
immoral
you
wouldn
t
believe
at
what
hours
he
comes
home
and
he
s
only
left
oxford
a
few
really
don
t
know
what
they
teach
them
there
lady
windermere
are
men
bad
duchess
of
berwick
oh
all
of
them
my
dear
all
of
them
without
any
exception
and
they
never
grow
any
better
men
become
old
but
they
never
become
good
lady
windermere
windermere
and
i
married
for
love
duchess
of
berwick
yes
we
begin
like
that
it
was
only
berwick
s
brutal
and
incessant
threats
of
suicide
that
made
me
accept
him
at
all
and
before
the
year
was
out
he
was
running
after
all
kinds
of
petticoats
every
colour
every
shape
every
material
in
fact
before
the
honeymoon
was
over
i
caught
him
winking
at
my
maid
a
most
pretty
respectable
girl
i
dismissed
her
at
once
without
a
i
remember
i
passed
her
on
to
my
sister
poor
dear
sir
george
is
so
i
thought
it
wouldn
t
matter
but
it
did
was
most
unfortunate
and
now
my
dear
child
i
must
go
as
we
are
dining
out
and
mind
you
don
t
take
this
little
aberration
of
windermere
s
too
much
to
heart
just
take
him
abroad
and
he
ll
come
back
to
you
all
right
lady
windermere
come
back
to
me
duchess
of
berwick
yes
dear
these
wicked
women
get
our
husbands
away
from
us
but
they
always
come
back
slightly
damaged
of
course
and
don
t
make
scenes
men
hate
them
lady
windermere
it
is
very
kind
of
you
duchess
to
come
and
tell
me
all
this
but
i
can
t
believe
that
my
husband
is
untrue
to
me
duchess
of
berwick
pretty
child
i
was
like
that
once
now
i
know
that
all
men
are
monsters
lady
windermere
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
feed
the
wretches
well
a
good
cook
does
wonders
and
that
i
know
you
have
my
dear
margaret
you
are
not
going
to
cry
lady
windermere
you
needn
t
be
afraid
duchess
i
never
cry
duchess
of
berwick
that
s
quite
right
dear
crying
is
the
refuge
of
plain
women
but
the
ruin
of
pretty
ones
agatha
darling
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
back
of
table
duchess
of
berwick
come
and
bid
to
lady
windermere
and
thank
her
for
your
charming
visit
down
and
by
the
way
i
must
thank
you
for
sending
a
card
to
s
that
rich
young
australian
people
are
taking
such
notice
of
just
at
present
his
father
made
a
great
fortune
by
selling
some
kind
of
food
in
circular
palatable
i
fancy
it
is
the
thing
the
servants
always
refuse
to
eat
but
the
son
is
quite
interesting
i
think
he
s
attracted
by
dear
agatha
s
clever
talk
of
course
we
should
be
very
sorry
to
lose
her
but
i
think
that
a
mother
who
doesn
t
part
with
a
daughter
every
season
has
no
real
affection
we
re
coming
dear
parker
c
and
remember
my
advice
take
the
poor
fellow
out
of
town
at
once
it
is
the
only
thing
to
do
once
more
come
agatha
duchess
lady
agatha
lady
windermere
how
horrible
i
understand
now
what
lord
darlington
meant
by
the
imaginary
instance
of
the
couple
not
two
years
married
oh
it
can
t
be
spoke
of
enormous
sums
of
money
paid
to
this
woman
i
know
where
arthur
keeps
his
bank
one
of
the
drawers
of
that
desk
i
might
find
out
by
that
i
find
out
no
it
is
some
hideous
mistake
and
goes
some
silly
scandal
he
loves
he
loves
but
why
should
i
not
look
i
am
his
wife
i
have
a
right
to
look
to
out
book
and
examines
it
page
by
and
gives
a
sigh
of
i
knew
it
there
is
not
a
word
of
truth
in
this
stupid
story
book
back
in
the
does
and
takes
out
another
a
second
to
open
paper
knife
on
with
it
cuts
cover
from
to
start
at
the
first
mrs
oh
it
is
true
it
is
true
how
horrible
book
on
lord
windermere
lord
windermere
well
dear
has
the
fan
been
sent
home
yet
margaret
you
have
cut
open
my
bank
book
you
have
no
right
to
do
such
a
thing
lady
windermere
you
think
it
wrong
that
you
are
found
out
don
t
you
lord
windermere
i
think
it
wrong
that
a
wife
should
spy
on
her
husband
lady
windermere
i
did
not
spy
on
you
i
never
knew
of
this
woman
s
existence
till
half
an
hour
ago
some
one
who
pitied
me
was
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
every
one
in
london
knows
daily
visits
to
curzon
street
your
mad
infatuation
the
monstrous
sums
of
money
you
squander
on
this
infamous
woman
lord
windermere
margaret
don
t
talk
like
that
of
erlynne
you
don
t
know
how
unjust
it
is
lady
windermere
to
you
are
very
jealous
of
erlynne
s
honour
i
wish
you
had
been
as
jealous
of
mine
lord
windermere
your
honour
is
untouched
margaret
you
don
t
think
for
a
moment
book
back
into
lady
windermere
i
think
that
you
spend
your
money
strangely
that
is
all
oh
don
t
imagine
i
mind
about
the
money
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
may
squander
everything
we
have
but
what
i
mind
is
that
you
who
have
loved
me
you
who
have
taught
me
to
love
you
should
pass
from
the
love
that
is
given
to
the
love
that
is
bought
oh
it
s
horrible
on
and
it
is
i
who
feel
degraded
don
t
feel
anything
i
feel
stained
utterly
stained
you
can
t
realise
how
hideous
the
last
six
months
seems
to
me
kiss
you
have
given
me
is
tainted
in
my
memory
lord
windermere
to
don
t
say
that
margaret
i
never
loved
any
one
in
the
whole
world
but
you
lady
windermere
who
is
this
woman
then
why
do
you
take
a
house
for
her
lord
windermere
i
did
not
take
a
house
for
her
lady
windermere
you
gave
her
the
money
to
do
it
which
is
the
same
thing
lord
windermere
margaret
as
far
as
i
have
known
lady
windermere
is
there
a
is
he
a
myth
lord
windermere
her
husband
died
many
years
ago
she
is
alone
in
the
world
lady
windermere
no
relations
lord
windermere
none
lady
windermere
rather
curious
isn
t
it
lord
windermere
margaret
i
was
saying
to
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
as
far
as
i
have
known
erlynne
she
has
conducted
herself
well
if
years
lady
windermere
oh
i
don
t
want
details
about
her
life
lord
windermere
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
any
details
about
her
life
i
tell
you
simply
erlynne
was
once
honoured
loved
respected
she
was
well
born
she
had
lost
it
away
if
you
like
that
makes
it
all
the
more
bitter
misfortunes
one
can
come
from
outside
they
are
accidents
but
to
suffer
for
one
s
own
is
the
sting
of
life
it
was
twenty
years
ago
too
she
was
little
more
than
a
girl
then
she
had
been
a
wife
for
even
less
time
than
you
have
lady
windermere
i
am
not
interested
in
should
not
mention
this
woman
and
me
in
the
same
breath
it
is
an
error
of
taste
at
lord
windermere
margaret
you
could
save
this
woman
she
wants
to
get
back
into
society
and
she
wants
you
to
help
her
to
lady
windermere
me
lord
windermere
yes
you
lady
windermere
how
impertinent
of
her
lord
windermere
margaret
i
came
to
ask
you
a
great
favour
and
i
still
ask
it
of
you
though
you
have
discovered
what
i
had
intended
you
should
never
have
known
that
i
have
given
erlynne
a
large
sum
of
money
i
want
you
to
send
her
an
invitation
for
our
party
of
lady
windermere
you
are
mad
lord
windermere
i
entreat
you
people
may
chatter
about
her
do
chatter
about
her
of
course
but
they
don
t
know
anything
definite
against
her
she
has
been
to
several
to
houses
where
you
would
go
i
admit
but
still
to
houses
where
women
who
are
in
what
is
called
society
nowadays
do
go
that
does
not
content
her
she
wants
you
to
receive
her
once
lady
windermere
as
a
triumph
for
her
i
suppose
lord
windermere
no
but
because
she
knows
that
you
are
a
good
that
if
she
comes
here
once
she
will
have
a
chance
of
a
happier
a
surer
life
than
she
has
had
she
will
make
no
further
effort
to
know
you
won
t
you
help
a
woman
who
is
trying
to
get
back
lady
windermere
no
if
a
woman
really
repents
she
never
wishes
to
return
to
the
society
that
has
made
or
seen
her
ruin
lord
windermere
i
beg
of
you
lady
windermere
to
door
i
am
going
to
dress
for
dinner
and
don
t
mention
the
subject
again
this
evening
arthur
to
him
you
fancy
because
i
have
no
father
or
mother
that
i
am
alone
in
the
world
and
that
you
can
treat
me
as
you
choose
you
are
wrong
i
have
friends
many
friends
lord
windermere
margaret
you
are
talking
foolishly
recklessly
i
won
t
argue
with
you
but
i
insist
upon
your
asking
erlynne
lady
windermere
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
lord
windermere
you
refuse
lady
windermere
absolutely
lord
windermere
ah

this
for
my
sake

to
do
with
me

lord
windermere
margaret
none
of
us
men
may
be
good
enough
for
the
women
we
is
quite
you
don
t
imagine
i
would
the
suggestion
is
monstrous
lady
windermere
why

be
different
from
other
men
i
am
told
that
there
is
hardly
a
husband
in
london
who
does
not
waste
his
life
over
shameful
passion
lord
windermere

am
not
one
of
them

heart

between
us

enough
apart

so
demmed
respectable
lord

you

talking
of
erlynne
i
suppose
i
only
met
her
six
months
ago
till
then
i
never
knew
of
her
existence
lord

you
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
her
since
then
lord

have
seen
a
good
deal
of
her
since
then
i
have
just
seen
her
lord
augustus
egad
the
women
are
very
down
on
her
i
have
been
dining
with
arabella
this
evening
by
jove
you
should
have
heard
what
she
said
about
erlynne
she
didn
t
leave
a
rag
on
her
berwick
and
i
told
her
that
didn
t
matter
much
as
the
lady
in
question
must
have
an
extremely
fine
figure
you
should
have
seen
arabella
s
expression
but
look
here
dear
boy
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
about
erlynne
egad
i
might
be
married
to
her
she
treats
me
with
such
demmed
indifference
she
s
deuced
clever
too
she
explains
everything
egad
she
explains
you
she
has
got
any
amount
of
explanations
for
all
of
them
different
lord
windermere
no
explanations
are
necessary
about
my
friendship
with
erlynne
lord
augustus
hem
well
look
here
dear
old
fellow
do
you
think
she
will
ever
get
into
this
demmed
thing
called
society
would
you
introduce
her
to
your
wife
no
use
beating
about
the
confounded
bush
would
you
do
that
lord
windermere
erlynne
is
coming
here
lord
augustus
your
wife
has
sent
her
a
card
lord
windermere
erlynne
has
received
a
card
lord
augustus
then
she
s
all
right
dear
boy
but
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
that
before
it
would
have
saved
me
a
heap
of
worry
and
demmed
misunderstandings
lady

cecil

lady
windermere
over
and
shakes
hands
lord
windermere
good
evening
arthur
why
don
t
you
ask
me
how
i
am
i
like
people
to
ask
me
how
i
am
it
shows
a
interest
in
my
health
now
i
am
not
at
all
well
been
dining
with
my
people
wonder
why
it
is
one
s
people
are
always
so
tedious
my
father
would
talk
morality
after
dinner
i
told
him
he
was
old
enough
to
know
better
but
my
experience
is
that
as
soon
as
people
are
old
enough
to
know
better
they
don
t
know
anything
at
all
hallo
tuppy
hear
you
re
going
to
be
married
again
thought
you
were
tired
of
that
game
lord
augustus
you
re
excessively
trivial
my
dear
boy
excessively
trivial
cecil
graham
by
the
way
tuppy
which
is
it
have
you
been
twice
married
and
once
divorced
or
twice
divorced
and
once
married
i
say
you
ve
been
twice
divorced
and
once
married
it
seems
so
much
more
probable
lord
augustus
i
have
a
very
bad
memory
i
really
don
t
remember
which
away
lady
plymdale
lord
windermere
i
ve
something
most
particular
to
ask
you
lord
windermere
i
am
you
will
excuse
must
join
my
wife
lady
plymdale
oh
you
mustn
t
dream
of
such
a
thing
it
s
most
dangerous
nowadays
for
a
husband
to
pay
any
attention
to
his
wife
in
public
it
always
makes
people
think
that
he
beats
her
when
they
re
alone
the
world
has
grown
so
suspicious
of
anything
that
looks
like
a
happy
married
life
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
at
supper
towards
door
of
lord
windermere
margaret
i
speak
to
you
lady
windermere
will
you
hold
my
fan
for
me
lord
darlington
thanks
down
to
lord
windermere
to
margaret
what
you
said
before
dinner
was
of
course
impossible
lady
windermere
that
woman
is
not
coming
here
lord
windermere
erlynne
is
coming
here
and
if
you
in
any
way
annoy
or
wound
her
you
will
bring
shame
and
sorrow
on
us
both
remember
that
ah
margaret
only
trust
me
a
wife
should
trust
her
husband
lady
windermere
london
is
full
of
women
who
trust
their
husbands
one
can
always
recognise
them
they
look
so
thoroughly
unhappy
i
am
not
going
to
be
one
of
them
lord
darlington
will
you
give
me
back
my
fan
please
thanks
a
useful
thing
a
fan
isn
t
it
i
want
a
friend
lord
darlington
i
didn
t
know
i
would
want
one
so
soon
lord
darlington
lady
windermere
i
knew
the
time
would
come
some
day
but
why
lord
windermere
i
tell
her

be
terrible
if
there
were
any
scene
margaret
parker
erlynne
lord
windermere
erlynne
beautifully
dressed
and
very
lady
windermere
at

sweetly
in

dropped
your
fan
lady

up
and
hands
it
to
erlynne

lord
windermere
how
charming
your
sweet
wife
looks
quite
a
picture
lord
windermere
a
low
it
was
terribly
rash
of
you
to
come
erlynne
the
wisest
thing
i
ever
did
in
my
life
and
by
the
way
you
must
pay
me
a
good
deal
of
attention
this
evening
i
am
afraid
of
the
women
you
must
introduce
me
to
some
of
them
the
men
i
can
always
manage
how
do
you
do
lord
augustus
you
have
quite
neglected
me
lately
i
have
not
seen
you
since
yesterday
i
am
afraid
you
re
faithless
every
one
told
me
so
lord
augustus
now
really
erlynne
allow
me
to
explain
erlynne
no
dear
lord
augustus
you

t
explain

your
chief
charm
lord
augustus
ah
if
you
find
charms
in
me
converse
lord
windermere
uneasily
about
the
room
mrs
erlynne
lord
darlington
lady
windermere
how
pale
you
are
lady
windermere
cowards
are
always
pale
lord

you
look
faint
come
out
on
the
terrace
lady
windermere
yes
parker
parker
send
my
cloak
out
erlynne
to
lady
windermere
how
beautifully
your
terrace
is
illuminated

me
of
prince
doria
s
at
rome
lady
windermere
goes
off
lord
darlington
oh
how
do
you
do
graham
isn
t
that
your
aunt
lady
jedburgh
i
should
so
much

s
hesitation
and
oh
certainly
if

aunt
caroline
allow
me
to
introduce
erlynne

so
pleased
to
meet
you
lady
jedburgh
beside
her
on
the
your
nephew
and
i
are
great
friends
i
am
so
much
interested
in
his
political
career
i
think
he
s
sure
to
be
a
wonderful
success
he
thinks
like
a
tory
and
talks
like
a
radical
and
that
s
so
important
nowadays
he
s
such
a
brilliant
talker
too
but
we
all
know
from
whom
he
inherits
that
lord
allandale
was
saying
to
me
only
yesterday
in
the
park
that
graham
talks
almost
as
well
as
his
aunt
lady
jedburgh
most
kind
of
you
to
say
these
charming
things
to
me
erlynne
continues
dumby
cecil
graham
did
you
introduce
erlynne
to
lady
jedburgh
cecil
graham

to
my
dear
fellow

won
t
speak
to
me
lady
plymdale
erlynne
lady
jedburgh
on
thursday
with
great
pleasure
speaks
lord
windermere
what
a
bore
it
is
to
have
to
be
civil
to
these
old
dowagers
but
they
always
insist
on
it
lady
plymdale
mr
dumby
who
is
that
woman
talking
to
windermere
dumby
haven
t
got
the
slightest
idea

like
an
de
of
a
wicked
french
novel
meant
specially
for
the
english
market
erlynne
so
that
is
poor
dumby
with
lady
plymdale
i
hear
she
is
frightfully
jealous
of
him

t
seem
anxious
to
speak
to
me
i
suppose
he
is
afraid
of
her
those
women

dreadful
tempers

you
know
i
think
i
ll
dance
with
you
first
windermere
lord

lip
and
it
will
make
lord
augustus
so
jealous
lord
augustus

insists
on
my
dancing
with
him
first

as
it
s
his
own
house
i
can
t
well
refuse
you
know
i
would
much
sooner

with
you
lord
augustus
a
low
i
wish
i
could
think
so
erlynne
erlynne

know
it
far
too
well
i
can
fancy
a
person
dancing
through
life
with
you
and

it
charming
lord
augustus
his
hand
on
his
white
oh

times

intensely
interesting
i
really
must
have
a
good
stare
at
her
to
door
of
and
looks
i
have
heard
the
most
shocking
things
about
her
they
say
she
is
ruining
poor
windermere
and
lady
windermere
who
goes
in
for
being
so
proper
invites
her
how
extremely
amusing
it
takes
a
thoroughly
good
woman
to
do
a
thoroughly
stupid
thing
you
are
to
lunch
there
on
friday
dumby
why
lady
plymdale
because
i
want
you
to
take
my
husband
with
you
he
has
been
so
attentive
lately
that
he
has
become
a
perfect
nuisance
now
this
woman
is
just
the
thing
for
him
he
ll
dance
attendance
upon
her
as
long
as
she
lets
him
and
won
t
bother
me
i
assure
you

useful
they
form
the
basis
of
other
people

marriages
dumby
what
a
mystery
you
are
lady
plymdale
at
i
wish

dumby
i
myself
i
am
the
only
person
in
the
world
i
should
like
to
know
thoroughly
but
i
don
t
see
any
chance
of
it
just
at
present
pass
into
the
lady
windermere
lord
darlington
from
the
lady
windermere
yes
her
coming
here
is
monstrous
unbearable
i
know
now
what

at
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
right
out
you
should
have
lord
darlington
i
couldn
t
a
man

t
tell
these
things
about
another
man
but
if
i
had
known
he
was
going
to
make
you
ask
her
here
i
think
i
would
have
told
you
that
insult
at
any
rate
you
would
have
been
spared
lady
windermere
i
did
not
ask
her
he
insisted
on
her
my
my
commands
oh
the
house
is
tainted
for
me
i
feel
that
every
woman
here
sneers
at
me
as
she
dances
by
with
my
husband
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
i
gave
him
all
my
life
he
took
it
i
am
degraded
in
my
own
eyes
and
i
lack
am
a
coward
down
on
lord
darlington
if
i
know
you
at
all
i
know
that
you
can
t
live
with
a
man
who
treats
you
like
this
what
sort
of
life
would
you
have
with
him
you
would
feel
that
he
was
lying
to
you
every
moment
of
the
day
you
would
feel
that
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
false
his
voice
false
his
touch
false
his
passion
false
he
would
come
to
you
when
he
was
weary
of
others
you
would
have
to
comfort
him
he
would
come
to
you
when
he
was
devoted
to
others
you
would
have
to
charm
him
you
would
have
to
be
to
him
the
mask
of
his
real
life

cloak
to
hide
his
secret

voice
of
society
they
matter
a
great
deal
they
matter
far
too
much
but
there
are
moments
when
one
has
to
choose
between
living
one
s
own
life
fully
entirely
dragging
out
some
false
shallow
degrading
existence
that
the
world
in
its
hypocrisy
demands
you
have
that
moment
now
choose
oh
my
love
choose
lady
windermere
slowly
away
from
looking
at
him
with
startled
i
have
not
the
courage
lord
darlington
yes
you
have
the
courage
there
may
be
six
months
of
pain
of
disgrace
even
but
when
you
no
longer
bear
his
name
when
you
bear
mine
all
will
be
well
margaret
my
love
my
wife
that
shall
be
some
my
wife
you
know
it
what
are
you
now
this
woman
has
the
place
that
belongs
by
right
to
you
oh
out
of
this
house
with
head
erect
with
a
smile
upon
your
lips
with
courage
in
your
eyes
all
london
will
know
why
you
did
it
and
who
will
blame
you
no
one
if
they
do
what
matter
wrong
what
is
wrong
it
s
wrong
for
a
man
to
abandon
his
wife
for
a
shameless
woman
it
is
wrong
for
a
wife
to
remain
with
a
man
who
so
dishonours
her
you
said
once
you
would
make
no
compromise
with
things
make
none
now
be
brave

yourself
lady
windermere

am
afraid
of
being
myself

me
think
let
me
wait
my
husband
may
return
to
me
down
on
lord
darlington
and
you
would
take
him
back
you
are
not
what
i
thought
you
were
you
are
just
the
same
as
every
other
woman
you
would
stand
anything
rather
than
face
the
censure
of
a
world
whose
praise
you
would
despise
in
a
week
you
will
be
driving
with
this
woman
in
the
park
she
will
be
your
constant
dearest
friend
you
would
endure
anything
rather
than
break
with
one
blow
this
monstrous
tie
you
are
right
you
have
no
courage
none
lady
windermere
ah
give
me
time
to
think
i
can
not
answer
you
now
her
hand
nervously
over
her
lord
darlington

be
now
or
not
at
all
lady

from
the
then
not
at
all
lord

heart

time

one
moment

lives
souls
touched

margaret
lady
windermere
how
alone
i
am
in
life
how
terribly
alone
music
duchess
of
berwick
lord
paisley
and
guests
come
on
from
duchess
of
berwick
dear
margaret
i
ve
just
been
having
such
a
delightful
chat
with
erlynne
i
am
so
sorry
for
what
i
said
to
you
this
afternoon
about
her
of
course
she
must
be
all
right
if

her
a
most
attractive
woman
and
has
such
sensible
views
on
life
told
me
she
entirely
disapproved
of
people
marrying
more
than
once
so
i
feel
quite
safe
about
poor
augustus
can
t
imagine
why
people
speak
against
her
it
s
those
horrid
nieces
of
saville
re
always
talking
scandal
still
i
should
go
to
homburg
dear
i
really
should
she
is
just
a
little
too
attractive
but
where
is
agatha
oh
there
she
is
lady
agatha
hopper
from
terrace
hopper
i
am
very
very
angry
with
you
you
have
taken
agatha
out
on
the
terrace
and
she
is
so
delicate
hopper
awfully
sorry
duchess
we
went
out
for
a
moment
and
then
got
chatting
together
duchess
of
berwick
ah
about
dear
australia
i
suppose
hopper
yes
duchess
of
berwick
agatha
darling
her
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
duchess
of
berwick
did
hopper
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
duchess
of
berwick
and
what
answer
did
you
give
him
dear
child
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
duchess
of
berwick
my
dear
one
you
always
say
the
right
thing
hopper
james
agatha
has
told
me
everything
how
cleverly
you
have
both
kept
your
secret
hopper
you
don
t
mind
my
taking
agatha
off
to
australia
then
duchess
duchess
of
berwick
to
australia
oh
don
t
mention
that
dreadful
vulgar
place
hopper
but
she
said
she
d
like
to
come
with
me
duchess
of
berwick
did
you
say
that
agatha
lady
agatha
yes
mamma
duchess
of
berwick
agatha
you
say
the
most
silly
things
possible
i
think
on
the
whole
that
grosvenor
square
would
be
a
more
healthy
place
to
reside
in
there
are
lots
of
vulgar
people
live
in
grosvenor
square
but
at
any
rate
there
are
no
horrid
kangaroos
crawling
about
but
we
ll
talk
about
that
james
you
can
take
agatha
down
you
ll
come
to
lunch
of
course
james
at
one
instead
of
two
the
duke
will
wish
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
i
am
sure
hopper
i
should
like
to
have
a
chat
with
the
duke
duchess
he
has
not
said
a
single
word
to
me
yet
duchess
of
berwick

have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
you
lady
agatha
mr
hopper
and
now
margaret
i
m
afraid
it
s
the
old
old
story

love
at
the
end
of
the
season
which
is
so
much
more
satisfactory

lord
paisley
s
lady
plymdale
my
dear

that
uncommon
thing
called
common
sense
cecil

erlynne
charming
ball
it

been
quite
reminds
me
of
old
days
on
and
i
see
that
there
are
just
as
many
fools
in
society
as
there
used
to
be
so
pleased
to
find
that
nothing
has
altered
except
margaret
she
s
grown
quite
pretty
the
last
time
i
saw
years
ago
she
was
a
fright
in
flannel
positive
fright
i
assure
you
the
dear
duchess
and
that
sweet
lady
agatha
just
the
type
of
girl
i
like
well
really
windermere
if
i
am
to
be
the
duchess
s
lord
windermere
of
but
are
cecil
graham
rest
of
lady
windermere
a
look
of
scorn
and
erlynne
her
are
unconscious
of
her
erlynne
oh
yes
he
s
to
call
at
twelve
o
clock
he
wanted
to
propose
in
fact
he
did
he
kept
on
proposing
poor
augustus
you
know
how
he
repeats
himself
such
a
bad
habit
but
i
told
him
i
wouldn
t
give
him
an
answer
till
of
course
i
am
going
to
take
him
and
i
dare
say
i
ll
make
him
an
admirable
wife
as
wives
go
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
lord
augustus
fortunately
it
is
all
on
the
surface
just
where
good
qualities
should
be
of
course
you
must
help
me
in
this
matter
lord
windermere
i
am
not
called
on
to
encourage
lord
augustus
i
suppose
erlynne
oh
no
i
do
the
encouraging
but
you
will
make
me
a
handsome
settlement
windermere
won
t
you
lord
windermere
is
that
what
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
erlynne
yes
lord
windermere
a
gesture
of
i
will
not
talk
of
it
here
erlynne
then
we
will
talk
of
it
on
the
terrace
even
business
should
have
a
picturesque
background
should
it
not
windermere
with
a
proper
background
women
can
do
anything
lord
windermere
won
t
do
as
well
erlynne
no
you
see
i
am
going
to
accept
him
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
i
was
able
to
tell
him
that
i
what
shall
i
say
a
year
left
to
me
by
a
third
a
second
some
distant
relative
of
that
kind
it
would
be
an
additional
attraction
wouldn
t
it
you
have
a
delightful
opportunity
now
of
paying
me
a
compliment
windermere
but
you
are
not
very
clever
at
paying
compliments
i
am
afraid
margaret
doesn
t
encourage
you
in
that
excellent
habit
it
s
a
great
mistake
on
her
part
when
men
give
up
saying
what
is
charming
they
give
up
thinking
what
is
charming
but
seriously
what
do
you
say
to
i
think
in
modern
life
margin
is
everything
windermere
don
t
you
think
the
world

intensely
amusing
place
i
do
on
terrace

who
in

bring
him
lips
that
have
lost
the

he
does
not
understand
what
love
is
he
understands
it
as
little
as
you
i
see
what
you
want
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
for
you
to
get
me
back

a
life
i
would
have
then
living
at
the
mercy
of
a
woman
who

neither

nor
pity
in
her
a
woman
whom
it
is
an
infamy
to
meet
a
degradation
to

a
vile
woman

cecil
graham
towards

but
it
is
a
great
thing
to
come
across
a
woman
who
thoroughly
understands
one
dumby
it
is
an
awfully
dangerous
thing
they
always
end
by
marrying
one
cecil
graham
but
i
thought
tuppy

that
lord
augustus
a
very
serious
she
s
going
to
explain
that
cecil
graham
back
to
c
dumby
awfully
commercial
women
nowadays
our
grandmothers
threw
their
caps
over
the
mills
of
course
but
by
jove
their
granddaughters
only
throw
their
caps
over
mills
that
can
raise
the
wind
for
them
lord
augustus
you
want
to
make
her
out
a
wicked
woman
she
is
not
cecil
graham
oh
wicked
women
bother
one
good
women
bore
one
that
is
the
only
difference
between
them
lord
augustus
a
erlynne
has
a
future
before
her
dumby
erlynne
has
a
past
before
her
lord
augustus
i
prefer
women
with
a
past
they
re
always
so
demmed
amusing
to
talk
to
cecil
graham
well
you
ll
have
lots
of
topics
of
conversation
with
tuppy
and
going
to
lord
augustus
you
re
getting
annoying
you
re
getting
demmed
annoying
cecil
graham
his
hands
on
his
now
tuppy
you
ve
lost
your
figure
and
you
ve
lost
your
character
don
t
lose
your
temper
you
have
only
got
one
lord
augustus
my
dear
boy
if
i
wasn
t
the
most
man
in
cecil
graham
we
d
treat
you
with
more
respect
wouldn
t
we
tuppy
dumby
the
youth
of
the
present
day
are
quite
monstrous
they
have
absolutely
no
respect
for
dyed
hair
lord
augustus
round
cecil
graham
erlynne
has
a
very
great
respect
for
dear
tuppy
dumby
then
erlynne
sets
an
admirable
example
to
the
rest
of
her
sex
it
is
perfectly
brutal
the
way
most
women
nowadays
behave
to
men
who
are
not
their
husbands
lord
windermere
dumby
you
are
ridiculous
and
cecil
you
let
your
tongue
run
away
with
you
you
must
leave
erlynne
alone
you
don
t
really
know
anything
about
her
and
you
re
always
talking
scandal
against
her
cecil
graham
towards
him
my
dear
arthur
i
never
talk
scandal
only
talk
gossip
lord
windermere
what
is
the
difference
between
scandal
and
gossip
cecil
graham
oh
gossip
is
charming
history
is
merely
gossip
but
scandal
is
gossip
made
tedious
by
morality
now
i
never
moralise
a
man
who
moralises
is
usually
a
hypocrite
and
a
woman
who
moralises
is
invariably
plain
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
world
so
unbecoming
to
a
woman
as
a
nonconformist
conscience
and
most
women
know
it
i
m
glad
to
say
lord
augustus
just
my
sentiments
dear
boy
just
my
sentiments
cecil
graham
sorry
to
hear
it
tuppy
whenever
people
agree
with
me
i
always
feel
i
must
be
wrong
lord
augustus
my
dear
boy
when
i
was
your
cecil
graham
but
you
never
were
tuppy
and
you
never
will
be
up
i
say
darlington
let
us
have
some
cards
you
ll
play
arthur
won
t
you
lord
windermere
no
thanks
cecil
dumby
a
good
heavens
how
marriage
ruins
a
man
it
s
as
demoralising
as
cigarettes
and
far
more
expensive
cecil
graham
you
ll
play
of
course
tuppy
lord
augustus
himself
out
a
brandy
and
soda
at
can
t
dear
boy
promised
erlynne
never
to
play
or
drink
again
cecil
graham
now
my
dear
tuppy
don
t
be
led
astray
into
the
paths
of
virtue
reformed
you
would
be
perfectly
tedious
that
is
the
worst
of
women
they
always
want
one
to
be
good
and
if
we
are
good
when
they
meet
us
they
don
t
love
us
at
all
they
like
to
find
us
quite
irretrievably
bad
and
to
leave
us
quite
unattractively
good
lord
darlington
from
he
has
been
writing
they
always
do
find
us
bad
dumby
i
don
t
think
we
are
bad
i
think
we
are
all
good
except
tuppy
lord
darlington
no
we
are
all
in
the
gutter
but
some
of
us
are
looking
at
the
stars
down
at
c
dumby

are

in
the
gutter
but
some
of
us
are
looking
at
the
stars
upon
my
word
you
are
very
romantic
darlington
cecil
graham
too
romantic
you
must
be
in
love
who
is
the
girl
lord
darlington
the
woman
i
love
is
not
free
or
thinks
she
isn
t
instinctively
lord
windermere
he
cecil
graham
a
married
woman
then
well
there
s
nothing
in
the
world
like
the
devotion
of
a
married
woman
it
s
a
thing
no
married
man
knows
anything
about
lord
darlington
oh
she
doesn
t
love
me
she
is
a
good
woman
she
is
the
only
good
woman
i
have
ever
met
in
my
life
cecil
graham
the
only
good
woman
you
have
ever
met
in
your
life
lord
darlington
yes
cecil
graham
a
well
you
are
a
lucky
fellow
why
i
have
met
hundreds
of
good
women
i
never
seem
to
meet
any
but
good
women
the
world
is
perfectly
packed
with
good
women
to
know
them
is
a
education
lord
darlington
this
woman
has
purity
and
innocence
she
has
everything
we
men
have
lost
cecil
graham
my
dear
fellow
what
on
earth
should
we
men
do
going
about
with
purity
and
innocence
a
carefully
buttonhole
is
much
more
effective
dumby
she
doesn
t
really
love
you
then
lord
darlington
no
she
does
not
dumby
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
fellow
in
this
world
there
are
only
two
tragedies
one
is
not
getting
what
one
wants
and
the
other
is
getting
it
the
last
is
much
the
worst
the
last
is
a
real
tragedy
but
i
am
interested
to
hear
she
does
not
love
you
how
long
could
you
love
a
woman
who
didn
t
love
you
cecil
cecil
graham
a
woman
who
didn
t
love
me
oh
all
my
life
dumby
so
could
i
but
it
s
so
difficult
to
meet
one
lord
darlington
how
can
you
be
so
conceited
dumby
dumby
i
didn
t
say
it
as
a
matter
of
conceit
i
said
it
as
a
matter
of
regret
i
have
been
wildly
madly
adored
i
am
sorry
i
have
it
has
been
an
immense
nuisance
i
should
like
to
be
allowed
a
little
time
to
myself
now
and
then
lord
augustus
time
to
educate
yourself
i
suppose
dumby
no
time
to
forget
all
i
have
learned
that
is
much
more
important
dear
tuppy
lord
augustus
uneasily
in
his
lord
darlington
what
cynics
you
fellows
are
cecil
graham
what
is
a
cynic
on
the
back
of
the
lord
darlington
a
man
who
knows
the
price
of
everything
and
the
value
of
nothing
cecil
graham
and
a
sentimentalist
my
dear
darlington
is
a
man
who
sees
an
absurd
value
in
everything
and
doesn
t
know
the
market
price
of
any
single
thing
lord
darlington
you
always
amuse
me
cecil
you
talk
as
if
you
were
a
man
of
experience
cecil
graham
i
am
up
to
front
off
lord
darlington
you
are
far
too
young
cecil
graham
that
is
a
great
error
experience
is
a
question
of
instinct
about
life
i
have
got
it
tuppy
hasn
t
experience
is
the
name
tuppy
gives
to
his
mistakes
that
is
all
lord
augustus
round
dumby
experience
is
the
name
every
one
gives
to
their
mistakes
cecil
graham
with
his
back
to
the
one
shouldn
t
commit
any
lady
windermere
s
on
dumby
life
would
be
very
dull
without
them
cecil
graham
of
course
you
are
quite
faithful
to
this
woman
you
are
in
love
with
darlington
to
this
good
woman
lord
darlington
cecil
if
one
really
loves
a
woman
all
other
women
in
the
world
become
absolutely
meaningless
to
one
love
changes
am
changed

interesting

to

not

till

have
searched
every
corner
of
it
what
moves
behind
that
curtain
towards
the
curtain
erlynne
behind
lord
windermere
lord
windermere
erlynne
one
starts
and
turns
lady
windermere
out
from
behind
the
curtain
and
glides
from
the
room
erlynne
i
am
afraid
i
took
your
wife
s
fan
in
mistake
for
my
own
when
i
was
leaving
your
house
i
am
so
sorry
fan
from
lord
windermere
at
her
in
lord
darlington
mingled
astonishment
and
lord
augustus
other
men
smile
at
each
act
drop
fourth
act
as
in
act
i
lady
windermere
on
how
can
i
tell
him
i
can
t
tell
him
it
would
kill
me
i
wonder
what
happened
after
i
escaped
from
that
horrible
room
perhaps
she
told
them
the
true
reason
of
her
being
there
and
the
real
meaning
of
fan
of
mine
oh
if
he
can
i
look
him
in
the
face
again
he
would
never
forgive
me
how
securely
one
thinks
one
of
reach
of
temptation
sin
folly
and
then
life
is
terrible
it
rules
us
we
do
not
rule
it
rosalie
rosalie
did
your
ladyship
ring
for
me
lady
windermere
yes
have
you
found
out
at
what
time
lord
windermere
came
in
last
night
rosalie
his
lordship
did
not
come
in
till
five
o
clock
lady
windermere
five
o
clock
he
knocked
at
my
door
this
morning
didn
t
he
rosalie
yes
my
nine
i
told
him
your
ladyship
was
not
awake
yet
lady
windermere
did
he
say
anything
rosalie
something
about
your
ladyship
s
fan
i
didn
t
quite
catch
what
his
lordship
said
has
the
fan
been
lost
my
lady
i
can
t
find
it
and
parker
says
it
was
not
left
in
any
of
the
rooms
he
has
looked
in
all
of
them
and
on
the
terrace
as
well
lady
windermere
it
doesn
t
matter
tell
parker
not
to
trouble
that
will
do
rosalie
lady
windermere
she
is
sure
to
tell
him
i
can
fancy
a
person
doing
a
wonderful
act
of
doing
it
spontaneously
recklessly
afterwards
finding
out
that
it
costs
too
much
why
should
she
hesitate
between
her
ruin
and
mine
how
strange
i
would
have
publicly
disgraced
her
in
my
own
house
she
accepts
public
disgrace
in
the
house
of
another
to
save
me
there
is
a
bitter
irony
in
things
a
bitter
irony
in
the
way
we
talk
of
good
and
bad
women
oh
what
a
lesson
and
what
a
pity
that
in
life
we
only
get
our
lessons
when
they
are
of
no
use
to
us
for
even
if
she
doesn
t
tell
i
must
oh
the
shame
of
it
the
shame
of
it
to
tell
it
is
to
live
through
it
all
again
actions
are
the
first
tragedy
in
life
words
are
the
second
words
are
perhaps
the
worst
words
are
merciless
oh
lord
windermere
lord
windermere
pale
you
look
lady
windermere
i
slept
very
badly
lord
windermere
on
sofa
with

so
sorry

came
in
dreadfully
late
and
didn
t
like
to
wake

the
country

all
right
at
selby
the
season

almost
over

away
if
you
like
we
can
easily
catch
the
i
ll
send
a
wire
to
fannen
and
sits
down
at
table
to
write
a
lady
windermere
yes
let
us
go
away
no
i
can
t
go
arthur
there
is
some
one
i
must
see
before
i
leave
one
who
has
been
kind
to
me
lord
windermere
and
leaning
over
kind
to
you
lady
windermere
far
more
than
that
and
goes
to
i
will
tell
you
arthur
but
only
love
me
love
me
as
you
used
to
love
me
lord
windermere
used
to
you
are
not
thinking
of
that
wretched
woman
who
came
here
last
night
round
and
sitting
of
you
don
t
still
you
couldn
t
lady
windermere
i
don
t
i
know
now
i
was
wrong
and
foolish
lord
windermere
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
receive
her
last
you
are
never
to
see
her
again
lady
windermere
why
do
you
say
that
lord
windermere
her
margaret
i
thought
erlynne
was
a
woman
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
as
the
phrase
goes
i
thought
she
wanted
to
be
good
to
get
back
into
a
place
that
she
had
lost
by
a
moment
s
folly
to
lead
again
a
decent
life
i
believed
what
she
told
was
mistaken
in
her
she
is
bad
as
a
woman
can
be
lady
windermere
arthur
arthur
don
t
talk
so
bitterly
about
any
woman
i
don
t
think
now
that
people
can
be
divided
into
the
good
and
the
bad
as
though
they
were
two
separate
races
or
creations
what
are
called
good
women
may
have
terrible
things
in
them
mad
moods
of
recklessness
assertion
jealousy
sin
bad
women
as
they
are
termed
may
have
in
them
sorrow
repentance
pity
sacrifice
and
i
don
t
think
erlynne
a
bad
know
she
s
not
lord
windermere
my
dear
child
the
woman
s
impossible
no
matter
what
harm
she
tries
to
do
us
you
must
never
see
her
again
she
is
inadmissible
anywhere
lady
windermere
but
i
want
to
see
her
i
want
her
to
come
here
lord
windermere
never
lady
windermere
she
came
here
once
as
guest
she
must
come
now
as
that
is
but
fair
lord
windermere
she
should
never
have
come
here
lady
windermere
it
is
too
late
arthur
to
say
that
now
lord
windermere
margaret
if
you
knew
where
erlynne
went
last
night
after
she
left
this
house
you
would
not
sit
in
the
same
room
with
her
it
was
absolutely
shameless
the
whole
thing
lady
windermere
arthur
i
can
t
bear
it
any
longer
i
must
tell
you
last
parker
a
tray
on
which
lady
windermere
s
and
a
parker
erlynne
has
called
to
return
your
ladyship
s
fan
which
she
took
away
by
mistake
last
night
erlynne
has
written
a
message
on
the
card
lady
windermere
oh
ask
erlynne
to
be
kind
enough
to
come
up

i
shall

very
glad

wants
to
see
me
arthur
lord
windermere
card
and
looks
at
margaret
i
you
not
to
let
me
see
her
first

any
rate

s
a
very
dangerous
woman
she
is
the
most
dangerous
woman
i
know
you
don
t
realise
what
you
re
doing
lady
windermere
it
is
right
that
i
should
see

lord
windermere
my
child
you
may
be
on
the
brink
of
a
great
sorrow
don
t
go
to
meet
it
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
her
before

lady
windermere
why
should
it
be
necessary
parker
parker
erlynne
mrs
erlynne

lady
windermere

am
so
sorry
about
your
fan
i
can
t
imagine
how
i
made
such
a
silly
mistake
most
stupid
of
me
and
as
i
was
driving
in
your
direction
i
thought
i
would
take
the
opportunity
of
returning
your
property
in
person
with
many
apologies
for
my
carelessness
and
of
bidding
you
lady
windermere
towards
sofa
erlynne
sits
down
beside
are
you
going
away
then
erlynne
erlynne
yes
i
am
going
to
live
abroad
again
the
english
climate
doesn
t
suit
me
is
affected
here
and
that
i
don
t
like
i
prefer
living
in
the
south
london
is
too
full
of
fogs
serious
people
lord
windermere
whether
the
fogs
produce
the
serious
people
or
whether
the
serious
people
produce
the
fogs
i
don
t
know
but
the
whole
thing
rather
gets
on
my
nerves
and
so
i
m
leaving
this
afternoon
by
the
club
train
lady
windermere
this
afternoon
but
i
wanted
so
much
to
come
and

have
to
go

am
afraid

our
lives

little
thing

like
you
to
do
for
me

you
mean
lord
windermere
i
sometimes
wish
you
had
i
should
have
been
spared
then
the
misery
the
anxiety
the
annoyance
of
the
last
six
months
but
rather
than
my
wife
should
the
mother
whom
she
was
taught
to
consider
as
dead
the
mother
whom
she
has
mourned
as
dead
is
divorced
woman
going
about
under
an
assumed
name
a
bad
woman
preying
upon
life
as
i
know
you
now
to
than
that
i
was
ready
to
supply
you
with
money
to
pay
bill
after
bill
extravagance
after
extravagance
to
risk
what
occurred
yesterday
the
first
quarrel
i
have
ever
had
with
my
wife
you
don
t
understand
what
that
means
to
me
how
could
you
but
i
tell
you
that
the
only
bitter
words
that
ever
came
from
those
sweet
lips
of
hers
were
on
your
account
and
i
hate
to
see
you
next
her
you
sully
the
innocence
that
is
in
her
and
then
i
used
to
think
that
with
all
your
faults
you
were
frank
and
honest
you
are
not
erlynne
why
do
you
say
that
lord
windermere
you
made
me
get
you
an
invitation
to
my
wife
s
ball
erlynne
for
my
daughter
s
lord
windermere
you
came
and
within
an
hour
of
your
leaving
the
house
you
are
found
in
a
man
s
are
disgraced
before
every
one
up
stage
erlynne
yes
lord
windermere
round
on
therefore
i
have
a
right
to
look
upon
you
as
what
you
worthless
vicious
woman
i
have
the
right
to
tell
you
never
to
enter
this
house
never
to
attempt
to
come
near
my
erlynne
my
daughter
you
mean
lord
windermere
you
have
no
right
to
claim
her
as
your
daughter
you
left
her
abandoned
her
when
she
was
but
a
child
in
the
cradle
abandoned
her
for
your
lover
who
abandoned
you
in
turn
erlynne
do
you
count
that
to
his
credit
lord
to
mine
lord
windermere
to
his
now
that
i
know
you
erlynne
take
had
better
be
careful
lord
windermere
oh
i
am
not
going
to
mince
words
for
you
i
know
you
thoroughly
erlynne
steadily
at
i
question
that
lord
windermere
i
know
you
for
twenty
years
of
your
life
you
lived
without
your
child
without
a
thought
of
your
child
one
day
you
read
in
the
papers
that
she
had
married
a
rich
man
you
saw
your
hideous
chance
you
knew
that
to
spare
her
the
ignominy
of
learning
that
a
woman
like
you
was
her
mother
i
would
endure
anything
you
began
your
blackmailing
erlynne
her
don
t
use
ugly
words
windermere
they
are
vulgar
i
saw
my
chance
it
is
true
and
took
it
lord
windermere
yes
you
took
spoiled
it
all
last
night
by
being
found
out
erlynne
a
strange
you
are
quite
right
i
spoiled
it
all
last
night
lord
windermere
and
as
for
your
blunder
in
taking
my
wife
s
fan
from
here
and
then
leaving
it
about
in
darlington
s
rooms
it
is
unpardonable
i
can
t
bear
the
sight
of
it
now
i
shall
never
let
my
wife
use
it
again
the
thing
is
soiled
for
me
you
should
have
kept
it
and
not
brought
it
back
erlynne
i
think
i
shall
keep
it
it
s
extremely
pretty
up
i
shall
ask
margaret
to
give
it
to
me
lord
windermere
i
hope
my
wife
will
give
it
you
erlynne
oh
i
m
sure
she
will
have
no
objection
lord
windermere
i
wish
that
at
the
same
time
she
would
give
you
a
miniature
she
kisses
every
night
before
she
s
the
miniature
of
a
young
girl
with
beautiful
hair
erlynne
ah
yes
i
remember
how
long
ago
that
seems
to
sofa
and
sits
it
was
done
before
i
was
married
dark
hair
and
an
innocent
expression
were
the
fashion
then
windermere
lord
windermere
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
this
morning
what
is
your
object
and
erlynne
a
note
of
irony
in
her
to
bid
to
my
dear
daughter
of
course
lord
windermere
his
under
lip
in
erlynne
at
her
voice
and
manner
become
her
accents
at
she
talks
there
is
a
note
of
deep
a
moment
she
reveals
oh
don
t
imagine
i
am
going
to
have
a
pathetic
scene
with
her
weep
on
her
neck
and
tell
her
who
i
am
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
i
have
no
ambition
to
play
the
part
of
a
mother
only
once
in
my
life
have
i
known
a
mother
s
feelings
that
was
last
night
they
were
made
me
made
me
suffer
too
much
for
twenty
years
as
you
say
i
have
lived
childless
want
to
live
childless
still
her
feelings
with
a
trivial
besides
my
dear
windermere
how
on
earth
could
i
pose
as
a
mother
with
a
daughter
margaret
is
and
i
have
never
admitted
that
i
am
more
than
or
thirty
at
the
most
when
there
are
pink
shades
thirty
when
there
are
not
so
you
see
what
difficulties
it
would
involve
no
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
let
your
wife
cherish
the
memory
of
this
dead
stainless
mother
why
should
i
interfere
with
her
illusions
i
find
it
hard
enough
to
keep
my
own
i
lost
one
illusion
last
night
i
thought
i
had
no
heart
i
find
i
have
and
a
heart
doesn
t
suit
me
windermere
somehow
it
doesn
t
go
with
modern
dress
it
makes
one
look
old
up
from
table
and
looks
into
and
it
spoils
one
s
career
at
critical
moments
lord
windermere
you
fill
me
with
absolute
horror
erlynne
i
suppose
windermere
you
would
like
me
to
retire
into
a
convent
or
become
a
hospital
nurse
or
something
of
that
kind
as
people
do
in
silly
modern
novels
that
is
stupid
of
you
arthur
in
real
life
we
don
t
do
such
as
long
as
we
have
any
good
looks
left
at
any
rate
consoles
one
nowadays
is
not
repentance
but
pleasure
repentance
is
quite
out
of
date
and
besides
if
a
woman
really
repents
she
has
to
go
to
a
bad
dressmaker
otherwise
no
one
believes
in
her
and
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
me
to
do
that
no
i
am
going
to
pass
entirely
out
of
your
two
lives
my
coming
into
them
has
been
a
discovered
that
last
night
lord
windermere
a
fatal
mistake
erlynne
almost
fatal
lord
windermere
i
am
sorry
now
i
did
not
tell
my
wife
the
whole
thing
at
once
erlynne
i
regret
my
bad
actions
you
regret
your
good
is
the
difference
between
us
lord
windermere
i
don
t
trust
you
i
tell
my
wife
it
s
better
for
her
to
know
and
from
me
it
will
cause
her
infinite
will
humiliate
her
terribly
but
it
s
right
that
she
should
know
erlynne
you
propose
to
tell
her
lord
windermere
i
am
going
to
tell
her
erlynne
up
to
if
you
do
i
will
make
my
name
so
infamous
that
it
will
mar
every
moment
of
her
life
it
will
ruin
her
and
make
her
wretched
if
you
dare
to
tell
her
there
is
no
depth
of
degradation
i
will
not
sink
to
no
pit
of
shame
i
will
not
enter
you
shall
not
tell
forbid
you
lord
windermere
why
erlynne
a
if
i
said
to
you
that
i
cared
for
her
perhaps
loved
her
would
sneer
at
me
wouldn
t
you
lord
windermere
i
should
feel
it
was
not
true
a
mother
s
love
means
devotion
unselfishness
sacrifice
what
could
you
know
of
such
things
erlynne
you
are
right
what
could
i
know
of
such
things
don
t
let
us
talk
any
more
about
for
telling
my
daughter
who
i
am
that
i
do
not
allow
it
is
my
secret
it
is
not
yours
if
i
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
her
and
i
think
i
will
i
shall
tell
her
before
i
leave

not

shall
never
tell
her
