foreword
the
purpose
of
this
series
of
stories
is
to
show
the
children
and
even
those
who
have
already
taken
up
the
study
of
history
the
of
the
colonists
with
whom
they
meet
in
their
books
to
this
end
every
effort
has
been
made
to
avoid
anything
savoring
of
romance
and
to
deal
only
with
facts
so
far
as
that
is
possible
while
describing
the
daily
life
of
those
people
who
conquered
the
wilderness
whether
for
conscience
sake
or
for
gain
that
the
stories
may
appeal
more
directly
to
the
children
they
are
told
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
child
and
purport
to
have
been
related
by
a
child
should
any
criticism
be
made
regarding
the
seeming
neglect
to
mention
important
historical
facts
the
answer
would
be
that
these
books
are
not
sent
out
as
histories
although
it
is
believed
that
they
will
awaken
a
desire
to
learn
more
of
the
building
of
the
nation
and
only
such
incidents
as
would
be
particularly
noted
by
a
child
are
used
surely
it
is
entertaining
as
well
as
instructive
for
young
people
to
read
of
the
toil
and
privations
in
the
homes
of
those
who
came
into
a
new
world
to
build
up
a
country
for
themselves
and
such
homely
facts
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
real
histories
of

land

truly
it
seems
a
great
undertaking
to
journey
from
london
into
the
land
of
america
yet
i
have
done
so
and
because
of
there
being
very
few
girls
only
twelve
years
of
age
who
are
likely
to
make
such
a
voyage
it
seems
to
me
well
if
i
set
down
those
things
which
i
saw
and
did
that
might
be
interesting
to
myself
in
the
future
when
i
shall
have
grown
to
be
an
old
lady
if
god
permits
or
to
any
other
who
may
come
upon
this
diary
of
course
i
must
first
set
down
who
i
am
in
case
strangers
should
some
day
chance
to
find
this
book
and
growing
interested
in
it
for
who
can
say
that
i
may
not
be
able
to
tell
a
story
which
shall
be
entertaining
because
of
there
being
in
it
much
which
the
people
of
england
have
never
seen
give
me
credit
for
having
written
a
diary
without
a
proper
beginning
you
must
know
then
that
my
name
is
ruth
in
the
year
of
our
lord
when
as
i
have
said
i
was
but
twelve
years
of
age
my
father
joined
that
company
led
by
master
john
winthrop
whose
intent
it
was
to
go
into
america
to
spread
the
gospel
and
there
also
build
up
a
town
wherein
should
live
only
those
who
were
one
with
them
in
the
worship
of
god
this
company
was
made
up
of
four
classes
of
people
first
there
were
those
who
paid
a
sum
of
money
for
their
passage
to
america
and
because
of
having
done
so
were
to
be
given
a
certain
number
of
acres
of
land
in
the
new
world
in
the
second
class
were
those
who
not
having
enough
money
to
pay
the
full
price
for
their
passage
agreed
to
perform
a
sufficient
amount
of
work
after
arriving
in
america
to
make
up
for
the
same
in
the
third
class
were
those
called
indentured
servants
which
is
much
the
same
as
if
i
said
apprentices
the
fourth
and
last
class
had
in
it
those
people
who
were
to
work
for
wages
at
whatsoever
trade
or
calling
they
were
best
fitted
it
needs
not
that
i
should
say
more
by
way
of
a
beginning
for
surely
all
the
people
in
england
if
they
do
not
know
it
now
will
soon
come
to
understand
why
we
together
with
those
who
have
gone
before
us
and
the
companies
that
are
to
come
after
have
journeyed
into
america
on
the
broad
ocean
it
was
decided
that
my
parents
and
of
course
myself
should
sail
in
the
same
ship
with
master
winthrop
and
the
name
of
that
vessel
was
the
she
having
been
so
called
in
honor
of
lady
arabella
johnson
who
journeyed
with
us
my
mother
was
sadly
grieved
because
of
mistress
winthrop
deciding
not
to
go
on
the
voyage
with
her
husband
but
to
join
him
in
the
new
world
later
and
this
decision
was
a
disappointment
to
very
many
of
the
company
i
am
in
doubt
as
to
whether
the
lady
arabella
would
have
gone
with
us
on
this
ship
had
she
not
believed
mistress
winthrop
also
was
to
go
it
was
on
the
day
of
march
in
that
year
which
i
have
previously
set
down
that
having
already
journeyed
from
london
to
southampton
we
went
aboard
the
counting
that
the
voyage
would
be
begun
without
delay
and
yet
because
of
unfriendly
winds
and
cruel
storms
our
ship
with
three
others
of
the
company
lay
at
anchor
until
the
eighth
day
of
april
then
it
was
after
the
captain
of
the
ship
had
shot
off
three
guns
as
a
farewell
that
we
sailed
out
on
the
broad
ocean
where
we
were
tossed
by
the
waves
and
buffeted
by
the
winds
for
nine
long
dreary
weeks
illustration
had
it
not
been
for
master
winthrop
discourses
day
after
day
we
should
have
been
more
gloomy
than
we
were
but
with
such
a
devout
man
to
remind
us
of
the
mercy
and
goodness
of
god
it
would
have
been
little
short
of
a
sin
had
we
repined
because
of
not
being
carried
more
speedily
to
that
land
where
was
to
be
our
home
there
was
one
day
during
the
voyage
when
it
seemed
verily
as
if
the
lord
was
not
minded
we
should
journey
away
from
england
we
had
not
been
out
from
the
port
many
days
when
on
a
certain
morning
eight
ships
were
seen
behind
us
coming
up
as
if
counting
to
learn
what
we
were
like
and
then
it
was
that
all
the
men
of
the
company
believed
these
were
spanish
vessels
bent
on
taking
us
prisoners
for
as
you
know
at
that
time
england
was
at
war
with
spain
it
was
most
fearsome
to
all
the
children
but
very
much
so
to
susan
a
girl
very
nearly
my
own
age
with
whom
i
made
friends
after
coming
aboard
and
myself
making
ready
for
battle
when
susan
and
i
saw
the
men
taking
down
the
hammocks
from
that
portion
of
the
vessel
which
was
called
the
gun
deck
loading
the
cannon
and
bringing
out
the
truly
were
we
alarmed
illustration
standing
clasped
in
each
other
arms
unheeded
by
our
elders
all
of
whom
were
in
a
painful
state
of
anxiety
or
fear
we
watched
intently
all
that
forenoon
the
ships
which
we
believed
belonged
to
the
enemy
then
i
heard
one
of
the
sailors
say
that
the
spaniards
were
surely
gaining
on
us
and
the
captain
of
the
vessel
as
well
as
master
winthrop
and
my
father
must
have
believed
it
true
for
all
preparations
were
made
for
a
battle
the
small
cabins
leading
from
the
great
one
were
torn
down
that
cannon
might
be
used
without
hindrance
and
the
bedding
and
all
things
that
were
likely
to
take
fire
were
thrown
overboard
the
boats
were
launched
into
the
sea
and
towed
alongside
the
ship
so
that
when
the
worst
came
we
might
fly
in
them
and
then
that
which
was
most
fearsome
of
all
the
women
and
children
were
sent
down
into
the
very
middle
of
the
vessel
where
they
might
not
be
in
danger
when
the
spaniards
began
to
send
iron
balls
among
us
as
it
seemed
certain
they
soon
would
while
we
were
huddled
together
in
the
darkness
many
weeping
some
moaning
and
a
few
women
among
whom
was
my
mother
silent
in
the
agony
of
grief
master
winthrop
came
down
to
pray
with
us
greatly
to
our
comforting
after
which
so
i
have
been
told
since
he
went
up
among
the
men
where
he
performed
the
same
office
it
was
not
until
an
hour
after
noon
that
our
people
discovered
that
those
ships
which
we
believed
to
be
spanish
were
english
vessels
from
which
we
had
nothing
to
fear
then
word
was
sent
down
to
us
in
that
dark
place
that
we
might
come
up
above
and
once
in
the
sunlight
again
we
found
all
the
passengers
rejoicing
and
making
merry
over
the
fears
which
had
so
lately
beset
them
how
bright
the
sun
looked
to
susan
and
me
as
we
stood
near
the
rail
of
our
ship
gazing
at
the
vessels
which
only
a
few
hours
before
were
a
fearsome
sight
but
now
seemed
so
friendly
it
was
as
if
we
had
been
very
near
to
death
and
were
suddenly
come
into
a
place
of
safety
the
rest
of
the
voyage
from
that
time
until
george
day
which
you
all
know
is
the
of
april
nothing
happened
deserving
of
being
set
down
here
then
it
was
however
that
during
the
forenoon
the
captain
moved
our
sails
so
that
the
ship
would
remain
idle
upon
the
waters
which
is
what
sailors
call
heaving
to
and
the
captains
of
the
other
vessels
together
with
master
pynchon
and
many
more
gentlemen
came
on
board
for
a
feast
lady
arabella
and
the
gentlewomen
of
our
company
had
dinner
in
the
great
cabin
while
the
gentlemen
partook
of
their
good
cheer
in
the
roundhouse
as
the
sailors
call
it
which
is
a
sort
of
cabin
on
the
hindermost
part
of
the
by
four
in
the
afternoon
the
feast
was
at
an
end
the
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
visit
us
went
on
board
their
own
ships
and
again
were
the
vessels
headed
for
that
country
of
america
in
which
we
counted
to
spend
the
remainder
of
our
lives
susan
and
i
were
much
together
during
this
voyage
for
neither
of
us
made
very
friendly
with
the
other
children
and
i
do
not
remember
that
anything
of
import
happened
until
we
were
come
so
the
captain
said
near
to
the
new
world
it
is
not
needed
i
should
set
down
that
again
and
again
were
there
furious
storms
when
it
seemed
certain
our
ship
would
be
sunk
for
there
was
so
much
of
such
disagreeable
weather
during
the
nine
weeks
of
voyaging
that
if
i
were
to
make
a
record
of
each
unpleasant
day
this
diary
would
be
filled
with
little
else
illustration
i
have
set
down
however
that
on
the
seventh
day
of
june
which
was
monday
we
had
come
so
master
winthrop
said
off
the
banks
where
was
good
fishing
to
be
found
but
why
this
particular
spot
on
the
ocean
should
be
called
the
banks
neither
susan
nor
i
could
understand
the
waves
were
much
like
those
we
had
seen
from
day
to
day
but
yet
in
some
way
the
captain
knew
that
we
had
come
to
the
place
where
it
would
be
possible
to
take
fish
in
great
numbers
and
so
we
did
it
is
not
seemly
a
young
girl
should
set
down
the
fact
with
much
of
satisfaction
that
she
enjoyed
unduly
the
food
before
her
and
yet
i
must
confess
that
those
fish
tasted
most
delicious
after
we
had
been
feeding
upon
pickled
pork
or
pickled
beef
with
never
anything
fresh
to
take
from
one
mouth
the
flavor
of
salt
it
was
a
feast
as
susan
and
i
looked
at
the
matter
far
exceeding
that
which
we
had
on
george
day
and
surely
more
enjoyable
to
us
for
what
can
be
better
pleasing
to
the
mouth
than
a
slice
of
fresh
codfish
fried
until
it
is
so
brown
as
to
be
almost
beautiful
after
one
has
had
nothing
save
that
which
is
pickled
the
first
view
of
america
five
days
later
which
is
the
same
as
if
i
said
on
the
twelfth
day
of
june
early
in
the
morning
when
susan
and
i
came
on
deck
we
saw
spread
out
before
us
the
land
and
it
needed
not
we
should
ask
if
this
was
the
america
where
we
were
to
live
for
all
the
people
roundabout
us
were
talking
excitedly
of
the
skill
which
had
been
displayed
by
the
master
of
the
in
thus
bringing
us
directly
to
the
place
where
we
had
counted
on
coming
it
can
well
be
fancied
that
susan
and
i
overhung
the
rail
as
the
ship
sailed
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
land
watching
intently
everything
before
us
yet
seeing
much
to
our
surprise
little
more
than
would
have
been
seen
had
we
come
upon
the
coast
of
england
i
had
foolishly
believed
that
even
the
shores
of
this
new
world
would
be
unlike
anything
to
be
found
elsewhere
and
yet
they
were
much
the
same
the
rocks
rising
high
above
the
waters
with
the
waves
beating
against
them
made
up
a
picture
such
as
we
had
before
us
even
while
we
lay
at
anchor
off
cowes
the
trees
were
like
unto
the
trees
in
our
own
land
and
the
grass
was
of
no
different
color
save
that
all
this
before
us
was
a
wilderness
we
might
have
been
off
the
coast
of
cornwall
i
have
said
it
was
all
the
same
and
yet
because
of
the
fears
and
the
anxieties
regarding
the
future
was
it
different
this
was
the
land
to
which
we
had
come
for
the
making
of
a
new
home
the
place
where
our
parents
had
pledged
themselves
to
spread
the
gospel
as
the
lord
would
have
it
spread
we
knew
because
of
what
had
been
written
by
our
friends
who
had
journeyed
to
this
new
world
before
us
that
here
we
were
to
find
brown
savages
many
of
whom
like
wild
beasts
would
thirst
to
shed
our
blood
here
also
could
we
expect
to
see
fierce
animals
such
as
might
not
be
met
with
elsewhere
in
the
world
and
in
the
way
of
blessings
we
should
meet
those
friends
of
ours
who
for
conscience
sake
and
for
the
will
to
do
god
bidding
had
come
to
prepare
the
land
that
it
should
be
more
friendly
toward
us
the
town
of
salem
i
had
not
yet
been
able
to
discover
any
of
the
dwellings
which
marked
the
town
of
naumkeag
or
salem
when
all
the
cannon
on
board
our
vessel
were
set
off
with
a
great
noise
then
as
we
came
around
a
point
of
land
there
appeared
before
our
eyes
a
goodly
ship
lying
at
anchor
and
beyond
her
the
town
that
was
much
to
my
disappointment
for
i
had
fancied
something
grander
made
up
of
a
few
log
houses
which
seemed
rather
to
be
quarters
for
servants
than
dwellings
for
gentlemen
families
although
we
had
been
told
that
the
habitations
would
be
rude
indeed
illustration
a
boat
was
put
into
the
water
from
our
ship
and
as
the
sailors
rowed
toward
the
vessel
which
was
at
anchor
i
heard
my
father
say
to
my
mother
that
they
were
going
in
quest
of
master
william
pierce
a
london
friend
of
ours
as
we
watched
i
asked
that
question
which
had
come
often
in
my
mind
during
the
voyage
which
was
why
this
new
town
that
master
endicott
had
built
should
have
two
names
mother
told
me
that
the
indians
had
called
the
place
naumkeag
and
so
also
did
those
men
who
first
settled
here
but
when
some
of
our
people
came
and
gathered
around
them
several
from
the
plymouth
colony
together
with
a
number
of
planters
who
had
built
themselves
homes
along
the
shore
it
was
decided
to
name
the
new
town
salem
which
means
peace
for
here
it
was
they
hoped
to
gain
that
peace
which
should
be
on
this
earth
like
unto
the
peace
we
read
of
in
the
book
which
passeth
all
understanding
and
now
before
i
set
down
that
which
we
saw
and
while
you
are
picturing
our
company
on
the
deck
of
the
looking
shoreward
impatient
to
set
their
feet
once
more
on
the
earth
let
me
tell
you
what
i
had
heard
since
we
left
england
regarding
this
town
of
peace
and
those
of
our
people
or
of
other
faiths
who
settled
here
two
years
or
more
ago
other
villages
master
endicott
who
was
of
our
faith
had
come
to
these
shores
in
march
of
the
year
with
a
company
of
thirty
or
forty
people
and
finding
other
men
living
at
the
head
of
this
harbor
which
the
had
entered
after
her
long
voyage
decided
to
build
his
home
at
this
place
in
the
next
year
master
higginson
coming
over
with
six
vessels
in
which
were
eighteen
women
children
and
three
hundred
men
joined
the
little
colony
these
last
brought
with
them
one
hundred
and
forty
head
of
cattle
and
forty
goats
however
only
two
hundred
of
this
last
company
remained
at
salem
the
others
having
chosen
to
build
for
themselves
a
new
town
which
they
called
charlestown
on
that
large
body
of
water
which
is
set
down
on
the
maps
as
massachusetts
bay
in
addition
to
these
two
villages
it
was
said
that
there
were
five
or
six
houses
at
the
place
called
nantasket
that
one
master
samuel
maverick
was
living
on
noddles
island
and
one
master
william
blackstone
on
the
shawmut
peninsula
i
have
set
this
down
to
the
end
that
those
who
read
it
may
understand
we
were
not
come
into
a
wild
country
in
which
lived
none
but
savages
and
i
must
also
add
that
not
so
many
miles
away
was
the
town
of
plymouth
where
had
been
living
during
ten
years
a
company
of
englishmen
who
had
worked
bravely
to
make
for
themselves
a
home
and
now
since
i
am
done
with
explaining
and
since
the
boat
which
put
out
from
our
vessel
and
which
i
left
you
watching
has
come
back
from
that
other
ship
bringing
master
william
pierce
let
me
tell
you
what
we
did
on
the
first
day
in
this
new
world
visiting
salem
illustration
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
our
company
were
invited
on
shore
to
a
feast
of
deer
meat
while
the
servant
women
and
maids
were
allowed
to
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbor
where
they
feasted
themselves
on
wild
strawberries
which
were
exceeding
large
and
sweet
it
would
be
untrue
for
me
to
say
that
deer
meat
made
into
a
huge
pie
is
not
inviting
because
of
my
having
enjoyed
it
greatly
and
yet
i
could
not
give
so
much
attention
to
the
dainty
as
i
would
have
done
at
almost
any
other
time
so
intent
was
i
upon
seeing
this
village
concerning
which
master
endicott
had
written
so
many
words
of
praise
had
susan
and
i
come
upon
it
within
an
hour
after
leaving
the
city
of
london
it
would
have
looked
exceedingly
poor
and
mean
but
now
when
we
were
on
the
land
after
a
voyage
of
nine
long
weeks
verily
it
seemed
like
a
wondrous
pleasant
place
in
which
to
live
more
than
an
hundred
dwellings
so
my
father
said
had
been
built
some
were
of
logs
laid
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
a
clumsy
fashion
with
the
places
where
windows
of
glass
should
have
been
covered
with
oiled
paper
and
doors
that
were
so
cumbersome
and
heavy
it
was
a
real
task
for
susan
and
me
to
open
and
close
them
but
yet
they
had
a
homely
look
then
there
were
what
might
be
called
sheds
made
of
logs
or
the
bark
of
trees
and
in
two
cases
dwellings
of
branches
laid
up
loosely
as
a
child
would
build
a
toy
camp
it
was
as
if
each
man
had
built
according
to
his
inclination
and
willingness
to
labor
the
more
thrifty
having
log
dwellings
and
the
indolent
ones
rude
huts
even
susan
and
i
could
understand
that
whosoever
had
decided
upon
the
places
where
these
homes
should
be
built
had
in
mind
the
making
of
a
large
town
for
paths
like
unto
streets
led
here
and
there
while
all
around
grew
trees
not
thickly
to
be
sure
but
yet
in
such
abundance
as
to
show
that
all
this
had
lately
been
a
wilderness
illustration
even
in
these
streets
had
been
left
the
stumps
of
trees
after
the
trunks
were
removed
which
served
to
give
an
untidy
look
to
the
whole
making
it
seem
as
if
one
were
in
a
place
where
had
been
built
shelters
only
for
a
little
time
and
which
would
shortly
be
abandoned
the
welcome
which
was
given
us
however
was
even
warmer
than
we
would
have
received
at
home
in
england
and
little
wonder
that
these
gentlefolk
whom
we
had
known
there
should
be
overjoyed
to
see
us
here
both
susan
and
i
came
to
understand
not
many
months
afterward
how
great
can
be
the
pleasure
one
has
at
seeing
old
friends
whom
he
had
feared
never
to
meet
again
in
this
world
it
was
a
veritable
feast
which
these
good
people
of
salem
set
before
us
and
yet
so
strange
was
the
cookery
that
i
am
minded
to
describe
later
some
of
the
dishes
at
risk
of
dwelling
overly
long
upon
matters
of
no
importance
making
comparisons
master
winthrop
said
when
we
were
going
on
board
the
ship
again
that
although
it
was
nothing
but
peas
pudding
and
fish
quite
coarse
as
compared
with
what
we
would
have
had
at
home
in
england
save
as
to
the
venison
pie
it
all
seemed
sweet
and
wholesome
to
him
when
the
day
was
come
to
an
end
we
went
into
the
ship
once
more
for
there
were
not
spare
beds
enough
in
all
the
town
to
serve
for
half
our
party
and
you
may
be
very
certain
that
once
we
were
gathered
again
in
the
great
cabin
all
talked
eagerly
concerning
what
had
been
done
at
least
our
parents
did
for
it
would
have
been
unseemly
in
us
children
to
interrupt
while
our
elders
were
talking
mother
was
not
well
satisfied
with
the
houses
believing
it
would
be
possible
to
make
dwellings
more
like
those
we
left
behind
but
father
bade
her
have
patience
saying
that
a
shelter
from
the
weather
was
the
first
matter
to
be
thought
of
and
that
the
pleasing
of
the
eye
could
well
come
later
after
we
had
more
with
which
to
work
illustration
she
thinking
as
was
i
at
the
moment
of
the
floor
in
the
house
where
we
ate
the
venison
pie
declared
stoutly
that
there
would
be
no
more
of
labor
in
laying
down
planks
at
least
in
the
than
in
beating
the
earth
hard
as
it
seemingly
had
been
where
we
visited
then
laughingly
he
bade
her
rest
content
nor
set
her
mind
so
strongly
upon
the
vanities
of
this
world
saying
that
if
god
permitted
him
to
raise
a
roof
so
that
his
wife
and
child
might
be
sheltered
from
the
sun
and
from
the
rain
he
would
be
satisfied
even
though
the
legs
of
his
table
stood
upon
the
bare
earth
it
was
this
conversation
between
my
parents
that
caused
the
other
women
to
talk
of
how
they
would
have
a
home
built
until
lady
arabella
put
an
end
to
what
was
almost
wrangling
for
each
insisted
that
her
plan
for
a
dwelling
in
this
new
world
was
the
best
by
saying
that
whatsoever
god
willed
we
should
have
and
that
it
would
be
more
than
we
deserved
an
indian
guest
and
other
visitors
both
susan
and
i
had
gazed
about
us
eagerly
when
we
went
on
shore
hoping
to
see
a
savage
we
were
not
bent
on
meeting
him
near
at
hand
where
he
might
do
us
a
mischief
but
had
the
desire
that
a
brown
man
might
go
past
at
a
distance
and
we
were
grievously
disappointed
at
coming
aboard
the
ship
again
without
having
seen
one
therefore
it
is
that
you
can
well
fancy
how
surprised
and
delighted
we
were
next
morning
when
on
going
on
deck
just
after
breakfast
to
have
another
look
at
this
new
town
whom
should
we
see
walking
to
and
fro
on
the
with
master
winthrop
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
first
gentlemen
of
the
land
but
a
real
indian
there
were
the
feathers
of
which
we
had
heard
encircling
his
head
and
ending
in
a
long
train
behind
his
skin
was
brown
or
perhaps
more
the
color
of
dulled
copper
he
wore
a
mantle
of
fur
with
the
skin
tanned
soft
as
cloth
and
that
which
father
said
was
deer
hide
cunningly
treated
until
it
was
like
to
flannel
had
been
fashioned
into
a
garment
which
answered
in
the
stead
of
a
doublet
illustration
i
can
not
describe
his
appearance
better
than
by
saying
it
would
not
have
surprised
me
had
i
been
told
that
one
of
our
own
people
had
painted
and
dressed
himself
in
this
fanciful
fashion
to
take
part
in
some
revel
for
truly
save
in
regard
to
the
color
of
his
skin
he
was
not
unlike
the
gentlemen
who
were
on
the
ship
as
susan
and
i
learned
later
he
was
the
king
or
chief
man
among
those
indians
who
called
themselves
agawams
father
said
he
was
the
sagamore
which
as
i
understand
it
means
that
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
people
and
his
name
was
masconomo
a
very
kindly
savage
was
he
and
in
no
wise
bloodthirsty
looking
as
i
had
expected
he
was
a
friend
of
master
endicott
as
well
as
of
all
those
who
lived
with
him
in
this
town
of
salem
and
had
come
to
welcome
our
people
to
the
new
world
which
as
it
seemed
to
both
susan
and
me
was
very
thoughtful
in
one
who
was
nothing
less
than
a
heathen
the
indian
sagamore
stayed
on
board
the
ship
all
day
and
our
company
together
with
the
people
of
salem
were
as
careful
to
make
him
welcome
as
if
he
had
been
king
james
himself
the
reason
for
this
as
father
afterward
explained
to
me
was
because
of
its
being
of
great
importance
that
we
make
friends
with
the
savages
else
the
time
might
come
when
they
would
set
about
taking
our
lives
being
in
far
greater
numbers
than
the
white
men
neither
susan
nor
i
could
believe
that
there
was
any
danger
that
these
people
with
brown
skins
would
ever
want
to
do
us
harm
surely
they
must
be
pleased
we
thought
at
knowing
we
were
willing
to
live
among
them
and
besides
if
all
the
savages
were
as
mild
looking
as
this
masconomo
they
would
never
be
wicked
enough
to
commit
the
awful
crime
of
murder
in
the
evening
after
the
indian
went
ashore
the
good
people
of
salem
came
on
board
in
great
numbers
and
seeing
that
it
was
a
time
when
he
might
do
good
to
their
souls
master
winthrop
gathered
us
on
deck
where
he
talked
in
a
godly
strain
not
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
illustration
it
was
indeed
wicked
of
susan
to
say
that
she
would
have
been
better
pleased
had
we
been
allowed
to
chat
with
the
people
concerning
this
new
land
rather
than
listen
to
master
winthrop
who
so
mother
says
is
a
most
gifted
preacher
even
though
that
is
not
his
calling
yet
way
down
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
felt
much
as
did
susan
although
fortunately
i
was
not
tempted
to
give
words
to
the
thought
a
christening
and
a
dinner
when
another
day
came
we
girls
had
a
most
delightful
time
for
there
was
to
be
a
baby
baptized
in
the
house
of
logs
where
are
held
the
meetings
and
mistress
white
one
of
the
gentlefolks
who
came
here
with
the
company
of
master
higginson
was
to
give
a
dinner
because
of
her
young
son
having
lived
to
be
christened
to
both
these
festivals
susan
and
i
were
bidden
and
it
surprised
me
not
a
little
to
see
so
much
of
gaiety
in
this
new
world
where
i
had
supposed
every
one
went
around
in
fear
and
trembling
lest
the
savages
should
come
to
take
their
lives
illustration
the
christening
was
attended
to
first
as
a
matter
of
course
and
because
of
his
having
so
lately
arrived
from
england
master
winthrop
was
called
upon
to
speak
to
the
people
which
he
did
at
great
length
although
the
baby
in
stiff
dress
and
mittens
of
linen
with
his
cap
of
cotton
wadded
thickly
with
wool
must
have
been
very
uncomfortable
on
account
of
the
heat
he
made
but
little
outcry
during
all
this
ceremony
or
even
when
master
higginson
prayed
a
very
long
time
we
were
not
above
two
hours
in
the
meetinghouse
and
then
went
to
the
home
of
mistress
white
getting
there
just
as
she
came
down
from
the
loft
with
her
young
son
in
her
arms
mother
was
quite
shocked
because
of
the
baby
having
nothing
in
his
hands
and
while
she
is
not
given
to
placing
undue
weight
in
beliefs
which
savor
of
heathenism
declares
that
she
never
knew
any
good
to
come
of
taking
a
child
up
or
down
in
the
house
without
having
first
placed
silver
or
gold
between
his
fingers
of
course
it
is
not
so
venturesome
to
bring
a
child
down
stairs
but
to
take
him
back
for
the
first
time
without
something
of
value
in
his
little
fist
is
the
same
as
saying
that
he
will
never
rise
in
the
world
to
the
gathering
of
wealth
the
dinner
was
much
enjoyed
by
both
susan
and
me
even
though
the
baby
who
seemed
to
be
frightened
because
of
seeing
so
many
strange
faces
cried
a
goodly
part
of
the
time
we
had
wild
turkey
roasted
and
it
was
as
pleasing
a
morsel
as
ever
i
put
in
my
mouth
then
there
was
a
huge
pie
of
deer
meat
with
baked
and
fried
fish
in
abundance
and
lobsters
so
large
that
there
was
not
a
trencher
bowl
on
the
board
big
enough
to
hold
a
whole
one
we
had
whitpot
yokhegg
suquatash
and
many
other
indian
dishes
the
making
of
which
shall
be
explained
as
soon
as
i
have
learned
the
methods
it
was
a
most
enjoyable
feast
and
the
good
people
of
salem
were
so
friendly
that
when
we
went
on
board
ship
that
night
susan
and
i
were
emboldened
to
say
to
my
father
that
we
should
be
rejoiced
when
the
time
arrived
for
our
company
to
build
houses
deciding
upon
a
home
illustration
then
we
learned
for
the
first
time
that
it
had
not
been
the
plan
of
our
people
to
settle
in
this
pleasant
place
it
was
not
to
the
mind
of
governor
winthrop
nor
yet
in
accord
with
the
belief
of
our
people
in
england
that
all
of
us
who
were
to
form
what
would
be
known
as
the
massachusetts
bay
colony
should
build
our
homes
in
one
spot
therefore
it
was
that
our
people
meaning
the
elders
among
the
men
set
off
through
the
forest
to
search
for
a
spot
where
should
be
made
a
new
town
and
we
children
were
allowed
to
roam
around
the
village
of
salem
at
will
many
of
us
among
whom
were
susan
and
i
often
spending
the
night
in
the
houses
of
those
people
who
were
so
well
off
in
this
world
goods
as
to
have
more
than
one
bed
lady
arabella
johnson
and
her
husband
had
gone
on
shore
to
live
the
second
day
after
we
arrived
for
my
lady
was
far
from
well
when
she
left
england
and
the
voyage
across
the
ocean
had
not
been
of
benefit
to
her
our
fathers
were
not
absent
above
three
days
in
the
search
for
a
place
to
make
our
homes
and
then
sarah
and
i
were
told
that
it
had
been
decided
we
should
live
at
charlestown
where
as
i
have
already
told
you
a
year
before
our
coming
master
endicott
had
sent
a
company
of
fifty
to
build
houses
it
pleased
me
to
know
that
we
were
not
going
directly
into
the
wilderness
as
both
susan
and
i
had
feared
but
that
we
should
be
able
to
find
shelter
with
the
people
who
had
already
settled
there
until
our
own
houses
could
be
built
it
appeared
that
all
the
men
of
our
company
were
not
of
governor
winthrop
opinion
regarding
the
place
for
a
home
some
of
them
discontented
with
the
town
of
charles
went
further
afoot
deciding
to
settle
on
the
banks
of
a
river
called
the
mystic
while
yet
others
crossed
over
that
point
of
land
opposite
where
we
were
to
live
and
found
a
pleasing
place
which
they
had
already
named
rocksbury
a
sad
loss
susan
and
i
believed
on
the
night
our
fathers
came
back
from
their
journey
that
we
would
set
off
in
the
ship
to
this
village
of
charlestown
without
delay
and
so
we
might
have
done
but
for
my
lady
arabella
who
was
taken
suddenly
worse
of
her
sickness
therefore
it
was
decided
to
wait
until
she
had
gained
her
health
but
alas
the
poor
lady
had
come
to
this
new
world
only
to
die
and
it
was
a
sad
time
indeed
for
susan
and
me
when
the
word
was
brought
aboard
ship
that
she
had
gone
out
from
among
us
forever
we
had
learned
during
the
voyage
to
love
her
very
dearly
and
it
seemed
even
more
of
a
blow
for
god
to
take
her
from
us
in
this
wilderness
than
if
she
had
been
at
her
home
in
england
although
it
is
not
right
for
me
to
say
so
because
of
course
our
fathers
know
best
yet
would
my
heart
have
been
less
sore
if
some
word
of
farewell
could
have
been
said
when
we
laid
my
lady
arabella
in
the
grave
amid
the
thicket
of
fir
trees
mother
says
that
she
is
but
repeating
the
words
of
governor
winthrop
that
it
is
wrong
to
say
prayers
over
the
dead
or
to
utter
words
of
grief
or
faith
therefore
it
was
in
silence
we
followed
my
lady
in
the
coffin
made
by
the
ship
carpenter
up
the
gentle
slope
to
the
thicket
of
firs
the
bell
of
the
tolling
all
the
while
and
in
silence
we
stood
while
the
body
was
being
covered
with
earth
little
thinking
how
soon
should
we
be
doing
a
like
service
for
another
who
had
come
to
aid
in
building
up
a
new
nation
on
the
day
after
we
left
my
lady
arabella
on
the
hillside
the
ship
which
was
one
of
the
vessels
that
should
have
sailed
in
company
with
the
arrived
at
salem
and
the
grief
which
filled
our
hearts
for
the
dead
was
lightened
somewhat
by
the
joy
in
greeting
the
living
who
were
come
to
join
us
illustration
rejoicing
turned
into
mourning
governor
winthrop
was
among
those
who
seemingly
had
most
cause
for
rejoicing
because
of
his
son
henry
having
arrived
on
the
bringing
news
of
his
mother
and
of
the
remainder
of
the
family
good
master
winthrop
had
so
much
of
business
to
look
after
on
this
day
that
he
could
not
spend
many
moments
in
talking
with
his
son
and
mayhap
he
will
never
cease
to
regret
that
he
did
not
give
his
first
attention
to
the
boy
for
during
the
afternoon
while
his
father
was
engaged
with
public
affairs
henry
was
moved
by
curiosity
to
visit
some
indian
wigwams
which
could
be
seen
a
long
distance
along
the
coast
illustration
not
being
of
the
mind
to
walk
so
far
he
cast
about
for
a
boat
of
some
kind
and
seeing
a
canoe
across
the
creek
plunged
into
the
water
to
swim
over
that
he
might
get
it
susan
and
i
were
watching
the
brave
young
man
when
he
sprang
so
boldly
and
confidently
into
the
water
never
dreaming
that
harm
might
come
to
him
and
yet
before
he
was
one
quarter
way
across
the
creek
he
suddenly
flung
up
his
arms
with
a
stifled
cry
then
he
sank
from
our
sight
to
be
seen
no
more
alive
he
had
been
seized
with
a
cramp
while
swimming
because
of
having
gone
into
the
cold
water
heated
so
my
father
said
for
the
day
was
very
warm
but
however
that
may
be
eight
and
forty
hours
later
we
walked
a
mournful
procession
up
the
hill
even
as
we
had
done
behind
the
earthly
clay
of
lady
arabella
while
the
bells
of
the
ships
in
the
harbor
tolled
most
dismally
verily
governor
winthrop
strength
is
in
the
lord
as
my
mother
said
for
although
his
heart
must
have
been
near
to
bursting
with
grief
no
one
saw
a
sign
of
sorrow
on
his
face
so
set
and
stern
as
he
stood
there
listening
to
the
clods
of
earth
that
were
thrown
upon
the
box
in
which
lay
the
body
of
his
son
susan
who
is
overly
given
to
superstition
i
am
afraid
declared
that
it
was
an
ill
omen
for
us
to
have
two
die
when
we
had
but
just
come
into
the
new
country
and
when
i
told
her
that
it
was
wicked
to
place
one
faith
in
signs
she
reminded
me
that
i
found
fault
because
of
mistress
white
baby
being
taken
out
of
the
room
for
the
first
time
with
neither
gold
nor
silver
in
his
hands
thanksgiving
day
in
july
the
ship
which
was
also
of
our
fleet
having
been
left
behind
when
we
sailed
from
england
came
into
the
harbor
on
the
sixth
of
july
and
then
it
was
although
our
hearts
were
bowed
down
with
grief
because
of
the
death
of
lady
arabella
and
the
drowning
of
henry
winthrop
that
our
people
decided
we
should
hold
a
service
of
thanksgiving
to
god
because
of
his
having
permitted
all
our
company
to
arrive
in
safety
word
was
sent
to
the
people
of
charlestown
and
to
those
few
men
in
the
settlement
which
is
called
dorchester
that
they
might
join
with
us
in
the
service
of
praise
and
many
came
to
salem
to
hear
the
preaching
of
master
endicott
master
higginson
and
governor
winthrop
illustration
leaving
salem
for
charlestown
four
days
later
which
is
the
same
as
if
i
said
on
the
twelfth
of
july
the
fleet
of
ships
sailed
out
of
salem
harbor
with
those
of
our
people
on
board
who
could
not
bear
the
fatigue
of
walking
to
go
up
to
the
new
village
of
charlestown
before
night
was
come
we
were
at
anchor
off
that
place
where
we
believed
the
remainder
of
our
days
on
this
earth
would
be
spent
because
of
the
labor
performed
by
those
men
whom
master
endicott
had
sent
to
this
place
a
year
before
there
were
five
or
six
log
houses
which
could
be
used
by
some
of
our
people
and
the
dwelling
which
of
course
would
be
the
most
lofty
in
the
town
was
partially
set
up
yet
the
greater
number
of
us
did
not
go
on
shore
immediately
to
live
governor
winthrop
remained
on
board
the
as
did
my
parents
and
susan
and
now
because
there
is
little
of
interest
to
set
down
regarding
the
building
of
the
village
am
i
minded
to
tell
that
which
i
heard
our
fathers
talking
about
evening
after
evening
as
we
sat
in
the
great
cabin
when
the
day
work
was
done
to
you
who
have
never
gone
into
the
wilderness
to
make
a
home
the
anxiety
which
people
in
our
condition
felt
concerning
their
neighbors
can
not
be
understood
to
us
if
all
we
heard
regarding
what
the
savages
might
do
against
us
was
true
it
was
of
the
greatest
importance
we
should
know
who
were
settled
near
at
hand
if
it
so
came
that
we
were
driven
out
from
our
town
our
neighbors
now
you
must
know
that
many
years
before
which
is
much
the
same
as
if
i
had
said
in
the
year
of
our
lord
a
number
of
english
people
who
had
been
living
in
holland
because
of
their
consciences
not
permitting
them
to
worship
god
in
a
manner
according
to
the
church
of
england
came
over
to
this
country
and
built
a
town
which
was
called
plymouth
illustration
this
town
was
not
far
by
water
from
our
settlement
indeed
one
might
have
sailed
there
in
a
shallop
if
he
were
so
minded
and
in
case
the
wind
served
well
perform
the
voyage
between
daylight
and
sunset
it
was
as
i
have
said
settled
ten
years
before
we
came
to
this
new
world
and
the
inhabitants
now
numbered
about
three
hundred
there
were
dwelling
houses
a
fort
well
built
with
wood
earth
and
stone
and
a
fair
watch
tower
entirely
around
the
town
was
a
stout
palisade
by
which
i
mean
a
fence
made
of
logs
that
stand
eight
or
ten
feet
above
the
surface
and
placed
so
closely
together
that
an
enemy
may
not
make
his
way
between
them
and
in
all
respects
was
it
a
goodly
village
so
my
father
declared
near
the
mouth
of
the
neponset
river
sir
christopher
gardner
who
was
not
one
of
our
friends
in
a
religious
way
had
settled
with
a
small
company
and
farther
down
the
coast
many
miles
away
it
was
said
were
three
other
villages
but
none
among
them
could
outshine
salem
either
in
numbers
of
people
or
in
dwellings
when
we
were
on
the
shore
in
charlestown
looking
straight
out
over
the
water
toward
the
nearest
land
we
could
see
not
above
two
miles
away
three
hills
which
were
standing
close
to
each
other
and
master
thomas
graves
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
people
that
first
settled
in
the
town
of
charles
had
named
the
place
trimountain
but
the
indians
called
it
shawmut
there
only
one
white
man
was
living
and
his
name
was
master
william
blackstone
as
i
have
already
told
you
it
seemed
to
me
a
fairer
land
because
of
the
hills
and
dales
than
was
our
settlement
and
yet
it
would
not
have
been
seemly
for
me
to
say
so
much
after
our
fathers
and
mothers
had
decided
this
was
the
place
where
we
were
to
live
getting
settled
the
days
which
followed
our
coming
to
charlestown
were
busy
ones
even
to
us
women
folks
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
in
taking
the
belongings
ashore
or
in
helping
our
neighbors
to
set
to
rights
their
new
dwellings
illustration
the
great
house
in
which
governor
winthrop
would
live
was
finished
first
and
into
this
were
moved
as
many
of
our
people
as
it
would
hold
then
again
there
were
others
who
not
content
with
staying
on
the
after
having
remained
on
board
of
her
so
long
put
up
huts
like
unto
the
wigwams
made
by
the
indians
which
while
the
weather
continued
to
be
so
warm
served
fairly
well
as
places
in
which
to
live
if
i
said
that
we
made
shift
to
get
lodgings
on
shore
in
whatsoever
manner
came
most
convenient
for
the
moment
i
should
only
be
stating
the
truth
for
some
indeed
were
lodged
in
an
exceeding
odd
and
interesting
fashion
susan
father
going
back
some
little
distance
from
the
great
house
cut
away
the
trees
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
four
standing
in
the
form
of
a
square
and
from
one
to
another
of
these
he
nailed
small
logs
topped
with
a
piece
of
sail
cloth
that
had
been
brought
on
shore
from
the
finishing
the
sides
with
branches
of
trees
sticks
and
even
two
of
his
wife
best
bed
quilts
into
this
queer
home
susan
went
with
her
mother
while
my
parents
were
content
to
use
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
great
house
until
father
could
build
for
us
a
dwelling
of
logs
illustration
the
great
sickness
it
seemed
much
as
if
susan
was
in
the
right
when
she
said
that
the
deaths
of
lady
arabella
and
henry
winthrop
were
ill
omens
because
no
sooner
had
all
our
people
landed
from
the
ships
or
come
up
through
the
forest
from
salem
than
a
great
sickness
raged
among
us
many
had
been
ill
during
the
voyage
with
what
master
higginson
called
scurvy
which
is
a
disease
that
attacks
people
who
have
lived
long
on
salted
food
and
again
many
others
took
to
their
beds
with
a
sickness
caused
by
the
lack
of
pure
fresh
water
our
fathers
had
but
just
begun
to
build
up
this
new
town
when
it
was
as
if
the
hand
of
god
had
been
laid
heavily
upon
us
for
so
it
was
said
not
more
than
one
out
of
every
five
of
our
people
was
able
to
perform
any
work
whatsoever
those
were
long
dismal
dreadful
days
when
at
each
time
of
rising
in
the
morning
we
learned
that
this
friend
or
that
neighbor
had
gone
out
from
among
us
and
it
seemed
to
susan
and
me
as
if
there
were
a
constant
succession
of
funerals
with
not
even
the
tolling
of
bells
to
mark
the
passage
of
a
body
from
its
poor
home
to
its
last
resting
place
on
earth
for
by
this
time
the
ships
had
gone
out
of
the
harbor
the
graves
on
the
side
of
the
hill
increased
tenfold
faster
than
did
the
dwellings
and
all
of
us
even
the
children
felt
that
our
only
recourse
now
was
to
pray
god
that
he
would
remove
the
curse
for
of
a
verity
did
it
seem
as
if
one
had
been
placed
upon
us
again
and
again
did
i
hear
men
and
women
who
had
ever
been
devout
and
regular
in
their
attendance
upon
the
preaching
ask
if
we
had
not
offended
the
lord
by
breaking
off
from
the
english
church
or
if
we
might
not
have
committed
some
sin
in
thus
abandoning
the
land
of
our
birth
thinking
to
ourselves
that
we
would
build
up
a
new
nation
in
the
world
therefore
it
was
that
even
susan
and
i
felt
a
certain
relief
of
mind
when
governor
winthrop
set
the
thirtieth
day
of
july
as
a
day
of
fasting
and
of
prayer
and
in
order
that
all
the
english
people
who
had
come
into
this
portion
of
the
new
world
might
unite
with
us
in
begging
god
to
remove
the
calamity
from
our
midst
word
was
sent
even
as
far
as
plymouth
asking
that
every
one
meet
on
that
day
with
words
of
devout
petition
moving
the
town
i
have
no
doubt
because
of
mother
having
said
so
again
and
again
that
the
good
lord
heard
our
fervent
entreaties
although
the
sickness
was
not
removed
from
among
us
for
near
to
six
weeks
illustration
then
it
was
that
master
william
blackstone
came
across
from
trimountain
and
told
governor
winthrop
it
was
his
belief
we
should
do
more
toward
aiding
ourselves
than
simply
praying
he
advised
because
of
there
being
plenty
of
good
water
in
trimountain
that
we
forsake
this
village
of
charlestown
and
go
across
to
the
opposite
shore
i
might
set
down
many
words
repeating
what
i
heard
our
fathers
say
concerning
the
wisdom
of
such
a
move
and
yet
this
story
which
i
am
telling
would
not
be
improved
thereby
for
the
day
finally
came
when
it
was
decided
that
even
at
the
cost
of
building
new
dwellings
we
should
take
all
our
belongings
across
the
water
to
the
cove
back
of
which
was
a
small
hill
and
yet
further
behind
a
circle
of
mountains
the
cove
would
make
an
agreeable
harbor
for
our
boats
the
hill
straight
behind
it
would
serve
as
a
location
for
a
fort
while
here
and
there
were
pleasant
streams
or
gushing
springs
whereas
in
charlestown
we
had
only
the
water
of
the
river
or
from
the
marsh
that
i
may
not
weary
you
by
much
explaining
it
is
best
i
say
that
on
the
seventeenth
of
september
when
the
sun
had
risen
we
gathered
at
the
great
house
to
pray
that
god
would
bless
us
in
this
which
was
much
the
same
as
our
second
undertaking
for
without
delay
and
before
night
had
come
we
were
to
go
across
the
bay
and
make
for
ourselves
other
homes
and
now
lest
it
seem
as
if
i
were
telling
the
same
story
twice
i
will
not
set
down
anything
concerning
the
building
of
this
second
village
because
of
that
which
we
did
in
trimountain
being
the
same
as
had
been
done
in
charlestown
the
great
house
was
taken
apart
and
carried
across
the
water
as
were
also
the
dwellings
of
logs
and
while
this
was
being
done
the
women
and
children
stayed
in
charlestown
where
master
thomas
graves
had
made
what
seemed
to
susan
and
me
odd
rules
and
regulations
master
graves
prohibits
swimming
he
had
been
placed
in
command
of
the
settlement
by
master
endicott
and
among
his
first
acts
was
the
appointment
of
tithing
men
one
of
whose
duties
it
was
to
prevent
the
boys
from
swimming
in
the
water
as
some
lads
of
our
company
speedily
learned
when
they
would
have
enjoyed
such
sport
they
were
arrested
straightway
and
but
for
the
fact
of
being
strangers
who
were
not
acquainted
with
the
rules
of
the
settlement
would
have
been
fined
three
shillings
each
susan
and
i
had
no
desire
to
spend
our
time
swimming
even
had
it
been
seemly
for
girls
so
to
do
but
during
very
warm
days
it
would
have
pleased
us
much
to
go
down
into
the
water
properly
clad
in
order
to
take
a
bath
therefore
did
we
believe
master
graves
had
done
that
which
was
almost
cruel
and
it
surprised
us
no
little
when
later
our
own
fathers
passed
the
same
law
anna
foster
party
there
were
good
friends
of
ours
in
england
who
believed
that
we
had
come
into
a
wilderness
where
was
to
be
found
naught
save
savages
and
furious
beasts
and
it
would
have
surprised
them
greatly
i
believe
if
they
could
have
known
how
much
of
entertainment
could
already
be
found
illustration
it
was
while
we
were
waiting
in
charlestown
for
the
homes
in
trimountain
to
be
built
that
anna
foster
whose
father
is
one
of
the
invited
all
of
us
young
girls
who
had
come
under
governor
winthrop
charge
to
spend
an
evening
with
her
and
we
had
much
pleasure
in
playing
hunt
the
whistle
and
thread
the
needle
anna
was
dressed
in
a
yellow
coat
with
black
bib
and
apron
and
she
had
black
feathers
on
her
head
she
wore
both
garnet
and
jet
beads
with
a
locket
and
no
less
than
four
rings
there
was
a
black
collar
around
her
neck
black
mitts
on
her
hands
and
a
striped
tucker
and
ruffles
her
shoes
were
of
silk
and
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
dressed
for
some
evening
entertainment
in
london
neither
susan
nor
i
wore
our
best
because
of
the
candles
here
being
made
from
a
kind
of
tallow
stewed
out
of
bayberry
plums
which
give
forth
much
smoke
and
mother
was
afraid
this
would
soil
our
clothing
we
were
also
told
that
because
of
there
not
being
candles
enough
some
parts
of
the
house
would
be
lighted
with
which
last
is
taken
from
the
pitch
pine
tree
and
fastened
to
the
walls
with
nails
this
wood
gives
forth
a
fairly
good
light
but
there
drops
from
it
so
much
of
a
black
greasy
substance
that
whosoever
by
accident
should
stand
beneath
these
flames
would
be
in
danger
of
receiving
a
most
disagreeable
shower
this
entertainment
was
not
the
only
one
which
was
made
for
our
pleasure
while
we
remained
in
charlestown
but
because
of
the
sickness
everywhere
around
very
little
in
the
way
of
merrymaking
was
indulged
in
and
it
seemed
almost
a
sin
for
us
to
be
thus
while
so
many
were
in
sore
distress
the
town
of
boston
the
first
thing
which
was
done
by
the
governor
and
his
advisors
after
we
had
moved
from
charlestown
was
to
change
the
name
of
trimountain
to
that
of
boston
as
you
must
remember
boston
in
england
was
near
to
the
home
of
captain
john
smith
who
explored
so
much
of
this
new
world
and
planted
in
jamestown
a
prosperous
settlement
it
was
also
in
boston
that
the
lady
arabella
and
the
preacher
john
cotton
who
had
promised
to
come
here
to
us
had
lived
therefore
did
it
seem
as
if
such
were
the
proper
name
for
a
town
which
we
hoped
would
one
day
god
willing
grow
to
be
a
city
it
is
true
our
new
village
is
built
in
a
rocky
place
where
are
many
hollows
and
swamps
and
it
is
almost
an
island
because
the
neck
of
land
which
leads
from
it
to
the
main
shore
is
so
narrow
that
very
often
does
the
tide
wash
completely
over
it
but
yet
after
that
time
of
suffering
in
charlestown
it
seems
to
us
a
goodly
spot
our
dwellings
except
the
great
house
are
made
of
logs
and
the
roofs
thatched
with
dried
or
with
the
bark
of
trees
that
each
man
shall
have
so
much
of
this
thatching
as
he
may
need
the
governor
and
chief
men
of
the
village
have
set
aside
a
certain
portion
of
the
salt
marsh
nearby
where
any
one
may
go
to
reap
that
which
is
needed
for
his
own
dwelling
but
no
more
illustration
in
time
to
come
so
father
says
we
shall
have
chimneys
built
of
brick
or
stone
for
when
our
settlement
is
older
grown
some
of
the
people
will
in
order
to
gain
a
livelihood
set
about
making
bricks
and
already
has
governor
winthrop
sent
out
men
to
search
for
limestone
so
we
may
get
mortar
but
until
that
time
shall
come
we
have
on
the
outside
of
our
houses
what
are
called
chimneys
which
are
made
of
logs
plastered
with
clay
or
of
woven
reeds
besmeared
both
as
to
the
outside
and
the
inside
with
mud
until
they
are
five
or
six
inches
thick
guarding
against
fires
it
needs
not
for
me
to
say
that
these
chimneys
are
most
unsafe
for
during
our
first
winter
in
this
new
town
of
boston
hardly
a
week
passed
but
that
one
or
another
caught
fire
and
among
the
first
laws
which
our
people
passed
was
one
providing
for
the
appointment
of
firewardens
who
should
have
the
right
and
be
obliged
to
visit
every
kitchen
looking
up
into
the
chimneys
to
see
if
peradventure
the
plastering
of
clay
had
been
burned
away
because
of
the
number
of
these
fires
and
the
likelihood
that
they
would
continue
to
visit
us
frequently
another
law
was
made
obliging
every
man
who
owned
a
dwelling
of
logs
to
keep
a
ladder
standing
nearby
so
that
it
might
be
easy
to
get
at
the
thatched
roof
if
the
flames
fastened
upon
it
and
as
soon
as
might
be
iron
hooks
with
large
handles
were
made
to
be
hung
on
the
outside
of
the
buildings
for
the
purpose
of
tearing
off
the
thatch
when
it
was
burning
it
has
also
been
decided
that
when
we
have
a
church
as
we
count
on
within
a
year
a
goodly
supply
of
ladders
and
buckets
shall
be
kept
therein
for
the
use
of
the
entire
town
and
then
when
a
fire
springs
out
our
people
will
know
where
to
go
for
tools
with
which
to
fight
against
it
our
own
new
home
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
because
of
our
dwellings
being
unsightly
on
the
outside
they
are
rough
within
for
such
is
not
the
case
many
of
the
settlers
as
did
father
brought
over
glass
for
the
windows
therefore
we
are
not
forced
to
put
up
with
oiled
paper
as
are
a
great
many
people
living
in
this
new
world
it
was
partly
the
dampness
inside
our
homes
so
governor
winthrop
believed
which
caused
the
sickness
in
charlestown
and
therefore
it
was
that
my
father
insisted
we
should
have
a
floor
of
wood
instead
of
striving
to
get
along
with
bare
ground
which
had
been
beaten
hard
our
floor
is
made
of
planks
roughly
hewn
it
is
true
but
nevertheless
it
serves
to
keep
our
feet
from
the
ground
we
have
on
the
door
real
iron
hinges
instead
of
leather
or
the
skins
of
animals
as
we
saw
in
salem
save
for
the
roughness
of
the
floor
and
the
walls
the
inside
of
my
father
house
is
much
the
same
as
we
had
in
england
for
he
like
all
of
governor
winthrop
company
who
were
able
to
do
so
brought
over
the
furnishings
of
the
old
home
and
while
some
of
the
things
look
sadly
out
of
place
here
they
provide
us
with
a
certain
comfort
which
would
have
passed
unheeded
in
the
other
country
because
there
we
were
not
much
better
off
in
this
world
goods
than
were
our
neighbors
illustration
here
when
i
see
a
table
made
only
of
rough
boards
spread
upon
trestles
i
can
get
much
pleasure
out
of
the
knowledge
that
we
brought
with
us
those
tables
which
we
had
been
using
in
england
and
when
our
dinner
is
spread
save
for
the
difference
in
the
food
i
can
well
fancy
myself
in
the
old
home
we
have
our
ware
of
pewter
and
of
copper
and
our
trencher
bowls
are
of
the
best
that
can
be
hewn
from
maple
knots
in
order
that
the
walls
and
crevices
filled
with
moss
and
plastered
over
with
clay
may
not
offend
the
eye
mother
has
put
up
all
the
hangings
which
she
brought
with
her
and
these
with
some
skins
my
father
bought
at
salem
hide
entirely
that
which
is
so
unsightly
in
other
dwellings
contrasting
our
home
with
many
which
we
saw
in
salem
or
in
charlestown
i
am
come
to
believe
my
lines
are
truly
cast
in
pleasant
places
and
i
strive
to
be
thankful
to
god
for
having
given
me
the
father
which
i
have
the
fashion
of
the
day
i
am
afraid
it
may
be
almost
sinful
for
me
so
to
set
my
mind
upon
the
garments
which
one
wears
and
yet
i
can
not
but
contrast
my
father
with
some
of
the
common
men
in
the
village
the
ruff
which
he
wears
around
his
neck
is
always
well
starched
clean
and
stands
out
in
beautiful
proportions
on
his
low
peaked
shoes
mother
ever
has
fixed
rosettes
or
knots
made
of
ribbon
his
doublet
which
is
gathered
around
the
waist
with
a
silken
belt
is
slashed
on
the
sleeves
to
show
the
snowy
linen
beneath
his
trunk
hose
meaning
those
which
reach
from
his
waist
to
his
knees
are
of
the
finest
wool
his
stockings
when
he
is
dressed
to
meet
with
the
council
are
of
silk
while
his
mandilion
or
cloak
is
always
of
silk
or
velvet
illustration
perhaps
one
may
think
such
attire
hardly
befitting
a
wild
place
like
this
yet
i
know
of
nothing
which
serves
to
set
off
a
man
figure
making
him
seem
of
importance
in
the
world
better
than
that
he
be
clad
with
due
regard
to
the
fashion
of
the
day
master
winthrop
would
not
present
the
gentlemanly
appearance
which
he
does
if
he
wore
as
do
the
common
people
here
a
band
or
a
flat
collar
with
cord
and
tassels
breeches
of
leather
and
a
leather
girdle
around
his
waist
if
he
had
as
do
they
heavy
shoes
with
heels
of
wood
or
if
his
clothing
were
fastened
together
with
hooks
and
eyes
instead
of
silken
points
and
if
his
hat
were
of
leather
would
we
be
pleased
to
call
him
governor
my
mother
often
says
that
it
is
unseemly
in
a
child
like
me
to
speak
of
the
clothing
worn
by
gentlemen
and
yet
i
have
noticed
often
and
again
that
she
is
as
careful
of
my
father
attire
when
he
goes
out
of
doors
as
she
was
at
home
in
england
where
all
gentlemen
were
dressed
becomingly
verily
one
need
not
go
abroad
in
tatters
or
oddities
simply
because
of
having
come
into
this
new
world
where
much
of
work
is
required
and
he
who
cares
for
his
personal
appearance
to
my
way
of
thinking
is
to
be
given
due
credit
surely
so
the
massachusetts
bay
company
thought
for
they
furnished
to
every
man
who
came
from
england
to
settle
here
save
it
be
those
who
could
afford
such
things
for
themselves
four
pairs
of
shoes
and
the
same
number
of
stockings
four
shirts
two
suits
of
doublet
and
hose
of
leather
lined
with
oiled
skin
a
woolen
suit
lined
with
leather
together
with
four
bands
and
two
handkerchiefs
a
green
cotton
waistcoat
two
pairs
of
gloves
a
leather
belt
a
woolen
cap
and
two
red
knit
caps
a
mandilion
lined
with
cotton
and
also
an
extra
pair
of
breeches
of
course
such
an
outfit
was
for
the
common
people
not
the
gentlefolk
illustration
in
our
company
the
boys
are
clothed
exactly
as
are
their
fathers
and
many
of
them
present
a
most
attractive
appearance
although
my
mother
would
not
think
it
proper
for
me
to
say
so
much
less
to
put
it
down
in
writing
my
own
wardrobe
it
surely
can
not
be
wrong
for
me
to
think
of
that
which
i
wear
for
if
the
good
lord
has
given
me
a
comely
body
why
shall
i
not
array
it
properly
or
if
it
be
wrong
why
did
my
father
buy
for
me
those
things
a
list
of
which
i
am
here
setting
down
not
from
vanity
but
simply
to
show
how
kind
were
my
parents
i
had
a
cap
ruffle
and
a
tucker
the
lace
of
which
cost
five
shillings
a
yard
eight
pairs
of
white
kid
gloves
with
two
pairs
of
colored
gloves
two
pairs
of
worsted
hose
and
three
pairs
of
thread
a
pair
of
laced
silk
shoes
and
a
pair
of
morocco
shoes
not
to
speak
of
four
pairs
of
plain
spanish
shoes
or
two
pairs
made
of
for
every
day
use
a
hoop
coat
and
a
mask
to
wear
when
the
wind
blows
too
roughly
and
a
fan
for
use
when
the
sun
is
hot
susan
had
two
necklaces
one
of
garnet
and
one
of
jet
but
i
had
only
garnets
then
i
have
a
girdle
with
a
buckle
of
silver
a
mantle
and
coat
of
lutestring
a
piece
of
calico
to
be
made
up
when
mother
has
time
four
yards
of
ribbon
for
knots
or
bows
and
one
and
yards
of
best
cambric
all
these
were
bought
especially
for
me
when
we
left
home
and
surely
it
can
be
no
sin
that
i
take
pride
in
them
master
johnson
death
it
was
shortly
after
coming
to
this
town
of
boston
that
we
heard
of
the
death
of
master
johnson
lady
arabella
husband
a
friendly
man
was
he
ever
ready
with
a
kindly
word
for
us
children
and
we
would
have
mourned
his
loss
much
more
but
for
knowing
that
it
pleased
him
right
well
to
go
out
of
this
world
of
sorrow
that
he
might
join
his
wife
in
god
country
susan
and
i
had
hoped
we
should
hear
of
no
more
deaths
among
those
we
cared
for
after
having
come
into
this
last
place
of
abode
and
the
news
of
master
johnson
taking
away
caused
her
superstitious
fears
to
break
out
anew
but
i
reminded
her
that
we
were
in
god
keeping
whatsoever
might
befall
and
that
for
us
to
look
forward
into
the
morrow
searching
for
evil
was
the
same
as
an
injustice
to
our
maker
who
would
do
toward
us
whatsoever
seemed
good
in
his
sight
as
i
look
back
now
upon
the
time
when
our
town
of
boston
first
came
into
being
i
can
understand
how
well
it
is
for
us
that
we
may
not
read
the
future
had
we
at
that
time
when
the
winter
was
coming
on
known
how
much
of
sorrow
and
of
suffering
was
in
store
for
us
before
the
earth
would
be
freed
from
its
bonds
of
ice
then
i
believe
of
a
verity
we
must
have
given
up
in
despair
however
it
is
not
for
me
to
look
ahead
even
in
this
poor
attempt
at
setting
down
what
we
did
in
the
new
land
rather
let
me
go
back
to
our
home
life
and
tell
somewhat
concerning
the
odd
dishes
which
were
frequently
set
on
our
table
many
new
kinds
of
food
there
is
little
need
for
me
to
say
that
we
had
lobsters
in
abundance
and
of
such
enormous
size
that
one
was
put
to
it
to
lift
them
i
have
heard
it
said
that
weight
was
not
unusual
and
whosoever
might
could
catch
in
traps
made
for
the
purpose
all
the
lobsters
he
would
illustration
as
for
other
fish
i
can
not
set
down
on
one
page
of
this
paper
the
many
kinds
with
which
the
housewife
might
provide
herself
for
a
trifling
sum
of
money
we
often
had
eels
roasted
fried
or
boiled
because
of
father
being
very
fond
of
them
and
mother
sometimes
stuffed
them
with
nutmegs
and
cloves
making
a
dish
which
was
not
to
my
liking
for
it
was
hot
to
the
tongue
some
of
the
good
wives
in
salem
had
shown
my
mother
how
to
prepare
nassaump
which
those
who
first
came
to
salem
learned
from
the
indians
how
to
make
it
is
nothing
but
corn
beaten
into
small
pieces
and
boiled
until
soft
after
which
it
is
eaten
hot
or
cold
with
milk
or
butter
nookick
is
to
my
mind
more
of
a
dainty
than
a
substantial
food
and
yet
father
declares
that
on
a
very
small
quantity
of
it
say
three
great
spoonfuls
a
day
a
man
may
travel
or
work
without
loss
of
strength
it
is
made
by
parching
the
indian
corn
in
hot
ashes
and
then
beating
it
to
a
powder
save
for
the
flavor
lent
to
it
by
the
roasting
i
can
see
no
difference
between
nookick
and
the
meal
made
from
the
ground
corn
mother
makes
whitpot
of
oat
meal
milk
sugar
and
spice
which
is
much
to
my
taste
although
father
declares
it
is
not
unlike
oatmeal
porridge
such
as
is
eaten
in
some
parts
of
england
but
it
hardly
seems
to
me
possible
because
of
one
not
putting
sugar
and
spice
into
porridge
we
often
have
bread
made
of
pumpkins
boiled
soft
and
mixed
with
the
meal
from
indian
corn
and
this
father
much
prefers
to
the
bread
of
rye
with
the
meal
of
corn
but
the
manner
of
cooking
pumpkins
most
to
my
liking
is
to
cut
them
into
small
pieces
when
they
are
ripe
and
stew
during
one
whole
day
upon
a
gentle
fire
adding
fresh
bits
of
pumpkin
as
the
mass
softens
if
this
be
steamed
enough
it
will
look
much
like
unto
baked
apples
and
dressed
with
a
little
vinegar
and
ginger
is
to
me
a
most
tempting
rarity
but
we
do
not
often
have
it
upon
the
table
because
of
so
much
labor
being
needed
to
prepare
it
yokhegg
is
a
pudding
of
which
i
am
exceedingly
fond
and
yet
it
is
made
of
meal
from
the
same
indian
corn
that
supplies
the
people
hereabout
with
so
much
of
their
food
it
is
boiled
in
milk
and
chocolate
sweetened
to
suit
one
taste
after
being
put
on
the
table
and
while
to
english
people
who
are
not
accustomed
to
all
the
uses
which
we
make
of
this
wheat
it
may
not
sound
especially
inviting
it
most
truly
is
a
toothsome
dainty
illustration
the
cost
of
setting
one
table
here
is
not
great
as
compared
with
that
in
england
for
we
may
get
a
quart
of
milk
by
paying
a
penny
or
a
dozen
fat
pigeons
in
the
season
for
three
pence
while
father
has
more
than
once
bought
wild
turkeys
to
the
weight
of
thirty
pounds
for
two
shillings
and
wild
geese
are
worth
but
eight
pence
the
supply
of
food
the
season
had
come
when
if
we
had
been
in
england
the
people
would
have
been
gathering
the
harvest
but
here
we
had
none
having
come
so
late
in
the
year
that
there
was
no
time
to
plant
and
consequently
we
had
no
crops
i
had
never
before
realized
how
necessary
it
is
for
people
that
the
earth
shall
yield
in
abundance
but
i
came
to
know
it
now
right
well
through
hearing
father
as
he
talked
with
mother
regarding
the
fears
which
the
chief
men
of
the
colony
had
concerning
the
supply
of
food
of
course
girls
such
as
susan
and
i
would
not
have
been
likely
to
learn
anything
of
the
kind
save
that
matters
had
come
to
such
a
pass
as
made
the
situation
serious
in
which
case
it
was
no
more
than
natural
we
should
hear
our
parents
talking
about
it
it
seems
from
what
i
learned
that
a
portion
of
the
provisions
brought
from
england
were
spoiled
during
the
voyage
and
also
that
many
of
our
people
had
taken
with
them
no
more
than
enough
to
sustain
life
for
a
month
or
two
believing
that
in
this
new
world
food
of
all
kinds
would
be
found
in
abundance
then
again
many
had
bartered
provisions
which
they
should
have
kept
for
the
winter
use
with
the
indians
in
exchange
for
beaver
skins
thinking
thereby
to
make
much
money
so
general
had
this
traffic
become
that
early
in
september
the
governor
gave
strict
orders
against
it
and
it
was
also
ordered
that
no
person
in
the
town
be
allowed
to
carry
out
therefrom
anything
eatable
but
yet
the
store
of
food
grew
smaller
and
smaller
for
there
were
many
mouths
to
feed
and
it
seemed
as
if
we
children
were
more
often
hungry
because
of
knowing
that
there
was
little
to
be
had
susan
reminded
me
of
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
the
omen
when
it
was
as
if
the
first
of
our
duties
in
the
new
world
had
been
to
bury
two
members
of
the
company
and
as
the
days
wore
on
i
began
really
to
believe
it
a
sin
to
harbor
such
thoughts
as
it
had
been
in
charlestown
so
did
it
come
to
be
here
in
boston
when
the
rains
of
autumn
set
in
many
of
the
dwellings
had
not
been
built
with
due
regard
to
sheltering
those
who
were
to
live
therein
and
because
of
the
dampness
although
mother
says
it
was
owing
quite
as
well
to
the
homesickness
and
gloom
which
came
upon
us
when
the
leaves
in
the
forest
turned
brown
and
yellow
and
golden
in
token
of
the
dying
year
the
people
sickened
however
it
was
much
of
sickness
prevailed
among
us
in
boston
until
the
time
came
when
my
father
and
mother
to
both
of
whom
god
had
allowed
good
health
were
absent
from
home
day
after
day
nursing
those
of
our
neighbors
who
were
unable
to
aid
themselves
illustration
the
sailing
of
the
lyon
it
seemed
at
this
time
as
if
the
lord
had
set
his
face
against
the
rearing
of
a
nation
in
this
new
land
which
he
had
given
to
the
brown
men
for
their
homes
and
susan
and
i
were
not
the
only
ones
who
came
to
believe
we
were
offending
him
in
some
way
by
thus
having
come
here
then
governor
winthrop
caused
it
to
be
known
throughout
the
town
that
he
had
hired
captain
pierce
of
the
ship
which
was
then
in
salem
harbor
to
go
with
all
haste
to
the
nearest
town
in
england
there
to
get
for
us
as
much
of
food
as
could
be
bought
this
news
cheered
the
people
somewhat
for
now
was
the
season
when
the
winds
blew
strong
and
it
was
believed
the
ship
would
have
speedy
passage
indeed
some
of
the
women
declared
she
must
return
before
the
middle
of
october
and
said
so
much
concerning
such
possibility
that
in
time
they
came
to
believe
it
true
therefore
when
the
month
of
october
had
nearly
passed
their
disappointment
was
great
and
they
were
more
despondent
than
at
first
the
famine
illustration
each
day
saw
the
store
of
provisions
in
the
town
grow
smaller
every
family
husbanded
that
which
could
be
eaten
with
greatest
care
putting
no
more
on
the
table
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
a
single
meal
and
those
things
which
we
had
considered
dainties
were
no
longer
prepared
then
came
the
angel
of
death
and
man
after
man
woman
after
woman
laid
themselves
down
to
die
not
from
being
starved
but
so
governor
winthrop
declared
from
having
sickened
through
scurvy
which
had
come
upon
them
during
the
voyage
after
which
falling
into
discontent
and
giving
way
to
they
no
longer
struggled
to
live
before
october
had
come
to
an
end
food
was
so
scarce
in
boston
that
the
poorer
people
had
nothing
save
acorns
clams
and
mussels
to
eat
during
the
summer
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
sea
were
actually
filled
with
fish
and
yet
now
when
every
boat
that
could
be
found
in
the
town
and
nearby
had
been
sent
out
it
was
difficult
for
our
men
to
take
even
fifty
pounds
weight
in
a
day
as
susan
said
even
the
fish
forsook
us
as
the
clams
and
mussels
would
have
done
had
they
legs
or
fins
the
fowls
of
the
forest
also
appeared
to
have
departed
and
by
november
the
most
any
family
could
boast
of
was
meal
boiled
in
salt
and
water
in
more
happy
days
i
would
have
turned
up
my
nose
at
such
food
and
yet
now
it
was
like
unto
some
sweet
morsel
for
so
scanty
had
our
store
become
that
my
mother
would
cook
for
each
meal
no
more
than
half
as
much
as
we
could
have
eaten
i
have
heard
father
say
that
for
a
bushel
of
flour
which
had
been
brought
from
england
he
paid
in
those
dark
days
fourteen
shillings
and
there
was
so
little
of
it
even
at
such
price
that
mother
saved
what
store
we
had
that
it
might
be
made
into
gruel
or
something
dainty
which
the
sick
could
keep
upon
their
stomachs
the
search
for
food
then
it
was
that
our
pinnace
was
made
ready
for
a
voyage
and
with
five
of
the
strongest
men
on
board
was
sent
along
the
coast
to
trade
with
those
indians
who
called
themselves
narragansetts
taking
with
them
everything
in
the
way
of
trinkets
which
was
in
the
general
store
or
could
be
gathered
up
from
among
the
housewives
illustration
great
was
our
rejoicing
five
days
later
when
the
men
came
back
bringing
with
them
an
hundred
bushels
of
indian
corn
this
seemed
like
a
large
amount
of
food
and
yet
so
many
were
the
mouths
to
be
fed
from
it
it
was
so
father
said
scarce
enough
to
hold
life
in
our
bodies
three
days
if
so
be
it
had
been
divided
equally
among
all
father
told
us
that
three
men
who
were
of
the
poorer
people
had
walked
all
the
way
from
boston
town
to
plymouth
but
even
there
where
a
harvest
had
been
gathered
they
could
get
no
more
than
one
of
meal
made
from
indian
corn
it
was
a
time
of
famine
such
as
i
pray
god
we
may
never
know
again
in
my
home
until
these
dreary
days
there
had
been
no
scarcity
of
food
and
yet
again
and
again
did
i
save
a
crust
of
rye
bread
thinking
it
a
dainty
to
be
nibbled
upon
slowly
so
that
i
might
have
longer
the
pleasure
of
eating
the
starvation
time
it
was
as
if
the
ship
on
whose
return
a
few
weeks
before
we
had
counted
so
hopefully
was
gone
never
to
come
back
even
the
children
watched
the
direction
of
the
winds
saying
on
this
day
that
it
was
a
favoring
one
if
the
were
on
her
course
for
boston
and
on
the
morrow
mourning
because
of
the
breeze
being
against
her
yet
she
came
not
nor
did
we
hear
aught
concerning
her
or
any
other
from
the
world
beyond
us
we
were
alone
in
what
was
much
the
same
as
a
wilderness
and
all
those
around
upon
whom
we
had
counted
to
aid
us
in
time
of
distress
were
in
nearly
the
same
dismal
straits
as
were
we
even
the
indians
declared
that
they
were
hard
pressed
for
something
to
eat
and
more
than
once
did
they
come
in
twos
or
in
threes
to
beg
from
us
who
were
starving
something
that
could
be
eaten
susan
and
i
as
we
sat
clasped
in
each
other
arms
hungry
and
pining
for
the
home
which
we
had
left
came
to
fancy
that
the
famine
which
held
possession
of
the
land
was
like
unto
some
terrible
monster
who
hung
above
us
as
a
cloud
settling
slowly
but
surely
day
after
day
until
the
hour
would
come
when
his
terrible
fangs
would
be
securely
fastened
upon
us
during
the
month
of
january
the
deaths
through
scurvy
if
that
indeed
were
the
cause
grew
less
but
all
believed
that
in
the
stead
of
being
removed
by
disease
our
people
were
slowly
perishing
from
starvation
all
the
food
in
boston
was
brought
together
and
portioned
out
so
that
no
one
whether
he
had
of
money
or
was
penniless
should
suffer
more
than
another
and
yet
again
and
again
in
the
night
have
i
been
awakened
by
the
gnawing
of
hunger
in
my
stomach
illustration
with
the
beginning
of
january
governor
winthrop
appointed
a
day
on
which
we
should
all
fast
and
pray
as
if
indeed
we
had
been
doing
other
than
fasting
throughout
the
long
dreary
winter
on
this
day
every
man
woman
and
child
in
boston
town
was
to
spend
his
or
her
time
in
praying
to
the
lord
to
deliver
us
from
our
affliction
we
no
longer
hoped
for
the
coming
of
the
surely
she
must
have
been
destroyed
by
the
tempest
otherwise
had
we
seen
her
before
this
for
nearly
five
months
had
gone
by
since
she
left
salem
harbor
a
day
to
be
remembered
it
was
on
the
fifth
day
of
february
which
is
the
same
as
if
i
had
said
saturday
and
the
fast
was
to
be
kept
on
the
next
thursday
susan
had
come
to
my
home
on
friday
night
to
sleep
in
my
bed
with
me
so
that
we
might
have
such
poor
comfort
as
could
be
found
in
each
company
when
we
were
nigh
to
starving
she
had
awakened
before
the
day
dawned
on
this
saturday
morning
which
will
be
remembered
by
me
so
long
as
the
lord
permits
that
i
live
and
moaned
in
distress
because
of
the
desire
for
food
until
i
opened
my
eyes
fretting
because
of
not
being
allowed
to
sleep
yet
longer
for
while
i
slumbered
the
pangs
of
hunger
were
not
known
seeing
me
awake
susan
began
to
speak
of
the
fast
day
on
the
following
thursday
saying
that
if
we
had
no
food
whatsoever
during
the
hours
at
a
time
when
we
were
so
near
to
starvation
surely
would
we
die
and
she
was
going
back
to
what
she
called
the
omens
which
came
to
us
shortly
after
we
arrived
when
we
were
startled
by
a
loud
shouting
in
the
street
next
beyond
where
could
be
had
a
view
of
the
sea
the
coming
of
the
lyon
dimly
like
one
in
a
dream
for
there
was
no
thought
in
my
mind
this
might
be
a
signal
that
our
time
of
trial
was
come
to
an
end
i
wondered
how
it
was
that
any
in
this
boston
of
ours
could
raise
their
voices
as
if
in
joy
until
i
heard
father
cry
out
from
the
below
the
has
arrived
the
has
arrived
illustration
it
might
be
that
i
could
give
you
by
the
aid
simply
of
words
some
faint
idea
of
how
we
suffered
during
the
time
of
starvation
of
sickness
and
of
death
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
set
down
that
which
shall
picture
the
heartfelt
rejoicings
and
fervent
thanksgiving
that
were
ours
at
thus
knowing
we
were
soon
to
have
enough
with
which
to
drive
death
from
our
doors
it
was
a
time
of
the
wildest
excitement
i
hardly
know
what
susan
and
i
did
or
said
on
that
day
save
that
we
dressed
hurriedly
running
down
to
the
very
shore
of
the
cove
finding
there
nearly
every
person
in
boston
and
stood
with
the
water
lapping
our
feet
as
we
watched
the
oncoming
of
the
ship
which
was
bringing
relief
never
before
had
i
thought
a
vessel
could
be
beautiful
but
i
have
not
seen
a
fairer
sight
than
was
the
on
that
morning
and
before
night
came
our
stomachs
which
had
been
crying
out
in
distress
because
of
lack
of
food
were
groaning
through
being
overly
well
filled
the
time
of
famine
had
passed
at
least
for
this
season
and
it
was
as
if
the
sick
began
to
gain
new
life
and
health
and
strength
simply
through
knowing
that
we
were
no
longer
in
such
dire
straits
another
thanksgiving
day
governor
winthrop
gave
voice
to
his
relief
and
pleasure
by
ordering
even
before
the
had
come
to
anchor
that
the
fast
which
had
been
appointed
for
the
next
thursday
should
be
a
day
of
thanksgiving
instead
and
so
we
made
it
with
prayers
all
the
more
fervent
because
of
our
stomachs
being
well
filled
and
the
fear
of
dying
by
starvation
being
put
behind
us
the
ship
was
loaded
with
such
things
as
wheat
peas
oatmeal
pickled
beef
and
pork
cheese
and
butter
and
with
what
my
mother
declared
was
of
the
greatest
value
lemon
juice
which
is
said
to
be
a
remedy
for
those
who
are
suffering
with
scurvy
it
was
not
allowed
that
those
who
had
money
should
buy
plentifully
of
this
cargo
but
it
was
paid
for
by
the
town
authorities
and
divided
equally
among
us
all
when
the
day
for
thanksgiving
came
my
mother
allowed
me
to
have
an
unusually
hearty
breakfast
for
she
said
there
was
so
much
for
which
to
be
thankful
and
so
many
who
would
be
present
to
give
thanks
that
no
one
could
say
when
we
might
be
able
to
have
dinner
it
was
well
she
was
thus
thoughtful
for
one
of
the
preachers
who
came
over
with
us
master
wilson
preached
while
governor
winthrop
treated
us
to
a
lecture
and
master
phillips
was
so
blessed
with
the
spirit
that
he
prayed
a
full
hour
susan
and
i
feared
we
would
have
yet
more
preaching
for
on
the
ship
had
come
a
young
man
whom
my
father
said
was
gifted
and
susan
father
believed
he
would
make
his
influence
felt
among
us
it
was
master
roger
williams
and
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
sat
in
fear
and
trembling
lest
governor
winthrop
should
call
upon
him
for
a
sermon
after
we
had
already
had
much
the
same
as
two
but
fortunately
so
it
seemed
to
me
master
williams
did
not
raise
his
voice
during
the
service
it
was
near
to
night
before
we
were
done
with
giving
thanks
and
then
at
each
home
was
held
a
feast
illustration
during
governor
winthrop
lecture
on
this
thanksgiving
day
he
urged
that
all
the
people
children
as
well
as
grown
folks
should
take
this
time
of
famine
as
a
lesson
reminding
us
that
it
would
not
be
a
long
while
before
we
could
hope
to
reap
a
harvest
and
in
the
meantime
there
was
very
much
of
labor
to
be
performed
he
declared
that
even
with
the
cargo
of
the
we
had
not
enough
to
satisfy
our
wants
until
crops
could
be
gathered
but
it
was
certain
other
ships
would
come
to
boston
during
the
summer
with
more
stores
yet
because
of
its
being
possible
we
might
come
to
a
time
of
suffering
again
so
must
we
be
careful
that
not
the
smallest
grain
of
wheat
be
wasted
a
defense
for
the
town
when
the
spring
had
come
and
before
it
was
time
to
put
seed
into
the
ground
our
fathers
set
about
building
a
defense
for
the
town
if
you
remember
i
have
already
set
down
that
this
new
village
of
ours
was
on
a
point
connected
with
the
main
coast
only
by
a
very
narrow
strip
of
land
now
to
defend
our
town
from
an
attack
by
enemies
save
they
should
come
by
water
it
was
only
necessary
the
defence
be
built
on
this
narrow
neck
or
strip
and
so
it
was
built
illustration
from
one
side
to
the
other
extending
even
down
into
the
water
was
a
palisade
or
fence
of
heavy
logs
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
a
gate
to
give
entrance
and
the
law
was
that
it
should
be
shut
at
sunset
not
to
be
opened
again
until
day
had
dawned
the
problem
of
servants
since
coming
here
we
have
seen
so
many
indians
as
to
become
acquainted
with
them
which
is
to
say
that
we
no
longer
look
upon
them
as
savages
and
have
no
fear
to
stand
in
the
road
when
they
pass
but
those
whom
susan
and
i
had
seen
up
to
the
day
when
chickatabut
the
chief
man
of
the
massachusetts
tribe
came
were
only
common
people
and
such
servants
as
are
employed
here
in
the
town
for
you
must
know
that
more
than
one
family
has
a
narragansett
indian
or
mayhap
a
nipmuck
to
work
in
the
house
illustration
mother
says
that
she
would
rather
do
all
the
work
of
the
house
alone
than
have
one
of
the
brown
women
to
help
her
for
they
are
not
cleanly
to
look
upon
but
as
for
myself
i
think
i
could
stand
the
sight
of
one
of
them
especially
when
it
comes
to
soap
making
of
which
i
will
tell
you
later
of
course
there
are
times
when
housewives
must
have
some
one
to
aid
them
and
those
girls
or
women
among
us
who
would
go
out
to
work
in
the
house
are
not
many
in
numbers
therefore
one
must
put
up
with
the
indians
which
is
unpleasant
or
take
those
who
are
known
as
indentured
servants
meaning
the
people
who
have
agreed
with
the
massachusetts
bay
company
to
work
for
so
many
years
in
order
to
pay
for
their
passage
over
from
england
as
for
these
last
people
mother
will
not
have
them
in
the
house
because
of
being
afraid
that
we
may
not
get
one
of
good
morals
therefore
in
our
home
mother
and
i
do
all
that
is
needed
rather
than
have
around
us
people
of
whom
we
know
nothing
chickatabut
it
was
not
regarding
the
indians
or
free
willers
as
indentured
servants
are
called
that
i
intended
to
write
when
i
began
that
which
i
counted
to
say
was
that
when
the
spring
had
come
after
the
arrival
of
the
and
we
were
free
for
the
time
being
from
fears
of
a
famine
the
indian
by
the
name
of
chickatabut
came
to
see
governor
winthrop
having
been
invited
to
the
end
that
he
might
sell
us
who
are
here
in
boston
this
piece
of
land
on
which
we
are
building
our
town
you
must
know
that
he
is
quite
the
most
important
savage
roundabout
here
and
father
believes
as
does
governor
winthrop
that
if
he
sells
us
the
land
it
will
be
a
lawful
bargain
because
of
his
standing
as
i
have
said
at
the
head
of
all
these
brown
people
nearabout
now
it
so
chanced
that
he
was
the
first
savage
of
note
i
had
seen
and
really
he
was
something
grand
to
look
upon
he
had
feathers
on
his
head
like
unto
a
crown
and
from
this
drooped
a
long
trail
of
feathers
reaching
to
the
ground
while
his
leggings
and
doublet
of
tanned
deer
skin
were
covered
with
beads
worked
in
fanciful
patterns
together
with
the
claws
of
beasts
his
arrows
were
carried
across
his
back
in
a
covering
embroidered
with
the
quills
of
the
porcupine
painted
in
various
colors
and
he
held
his
bow
in
his
hand
illustration
i
can
not
set
down
as
i
would
exactly
how
he
was
dressed
because
having
come
upon
him
suddenly
while
on
my
way
to
susan
house
of
being
startled
by
so
much
of
adornment
that
i
was
like
to
have
run
away
he
came
as
i
have
said
to
visit
governor
winthrop
and
father
declares
that
he
sat
at
the
table
as
a
white
man
would
have
done
save
that
instead
of
using
the
knife
and
spoon
he
took
up
food
with
his
fingers
mother
thinks
that
the
governor
must
have
been
relieved
indeed
when
his
guest
departed
for
no
one
insists
so
strictly
upon
proper
table
manners
as
does
master
winthrop
it
must
have
been
that
chickatabut
was
pleased
with
his
visit
for
two
or
three
days
after
having
gone
back
to
his
people
he
sent
the
governor
as
much
indian
corn
as
would
fill
a
hogshead
and
in
return
for
the
gift
master
winthrop
presented
him
with
a
suit
of
clothing
made
in
english
fashion
by
a
tailor
father
says
that
now
indeed
do
we
own
all
the
land
this
side
of
the
neck
for
master
blackstone
who
had
a
farm
here
as
i
have
already
said
sold
it
to
our
people
before
we
moved
over
from
charlestown
and
now
with
chickatabut
selling
of
the
same
there
should
be
no
question
as
to
who
has
a
lawful
claim
upon
it
building
a
ship
although
in
my
own
mind
there
was
never
any
doubt
but
that
the
land
was
rightfully
ours
without
consulting
a
savage
about
it
yet
i
believe
from
all
i
heard
said
that
our
people
felt
better
in
mind
after
this
indian
chief
had
agreed
to
our
staying
here
for
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
no
sooner
made
the
bargain
than
work
was
pushed
forward
more
as
it
would
have
been
done
in
england
as
for
instance
governor
winthrop
began
building
a
vessel
and
now
if
you
please
we
are
to
have
a
ship
of
our
own
made
in
boston
launched
in
boston
and
to
sail
from
boston
illustration
when
she
is
finished
and
has
sailed
to
southampton
or
liverpool
the
people
there
must
begin
to
believe
that
we
of
the
massachusetts
bay
colony
are
getting
well
on
in
the
world
if
we
can
own
fleets
for
in
case
one
vessel
can
be
built
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
have
many
while
there
is
so
much
of
lumber
everywhere
around
household
conveniences
do
you
know
what
a
is
we
have
two
in
our
house
which
were
brought
over
by
captain
pierce
of
the
as
a
gift
to
my
mother
you
who
have
more
or
less
trouble
with
your
rush
lights
can
not
fancy
how
luxurious
it
is
to
have
one
of
these
which
costs
in
care
no
more
than
is
required
to
fill
them
with
grease
or
oil
fearing
lest
you
may
not
know
what
these
lamps
are
which
mother
says
should
be
called
i
will
do
my
best
to
set
down
here
such
a
description
as
shall
bring
them
before
you
the
two
which
we
have
are
made
of
brass
but
captain
pierce
says
they
are
also
to
be
found
of
pewter
or
of
iron
these
are
round
and
very
much
the
same
shape
as
half
an
apple
save
that
they
have
a
nose
an
inch
or
two
long
which
sticks
out
from
one
side
the
body
of
the
bowl
is
filled
with
tallow
or
grease
and
the
wick
or
a
piece
of
twisted
cloth
is
threaded
into
the
nose
with
one
end
hanging
out
to
be
lighted
illustration
ours
hang
by
chains
from
the
ceiling
and
the
light
which
they
give
is
certainly
equal
to
if
not
stronger
than
that
of
a
wax
candle
but
they
are
not
so
cleanly
because
if
the
wick
be
ever
so
little
too
long
the
lamps
send
forth
a
great
smoke
father
says
he
has
seen
a
which
is
much
like
our
save
that
it
has
a
small
cup
underneath
the
nose
to
catch
the
dripping
grease
and
that
i
think
would
be
a
great
improvement
if
indeed
it
is
possible
to
improve
upon
so
useful
an
article
of
household
furniture
as
this
speaking
of
our
reminds
me
that
susan
mother
had
sent
over
to
her
in
the
a
set
of
cob
irons
which
are
something
after
the
fashion
of
andirons
or
save
that
they
are
also
intended
to
hold
the
spit
and
the
dripping
pan
she
had
also
a
pair
of
creepers
which
are
small
andirons
and
which
she
sometimes
used
with
the
cob
irons
illustration
the
andirons
which
we
brought
from
england
are
much
too
fine
to
be
used
in
this
fireplace
which
is
filled
with
pothooks
trammels
hakes
and
other
cooking
utensils
they
were
a
wedding
present
to
my
mother
and
are
in
what
we
call
sets
of
three
meaning
that
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
are
three
andirons
one
to
hold
the
heavy
logs
that
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
fire
another
raised
still
higher
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
smaller
sticks
and
a
third
for
much
the
same
purpose
as
the
second
or
perhaps
to
make
up
more
of
an
ornament
for
they
are
of
iron
and
brass
and
are
exceeding
beautiful
to
look
upon
i
have
used
the
words
trammels
and
hakes
but
it
is
possible
that
you
may
not
know
their
meaning
and
so
i
will
add
by
way
of
explanation
that
though
they
are
both
hooks
upon
which
we
may
hang
pots
and
kettles
the
trammel
is
so
constructed
that
it
may
be
lengthened
or
shortened
being
made
of
two
parts
how
the
work
is
divided
there
is
no
good
reason
why
i
should
make
any
attempt
at
setting
down
here
all
that
was
done
by
our
people
in
the
way
of
planting
in
order
that
we
might
have
such
a
harvest
in
the
fall
as
would
put
far
from
us
the
fear
of
another
famine
it
should
be
easy
for
you
to
fancy
how
we
are
employed
here
in
this
new
town
some
of
the
men
are
working
at
the
palisade
or
barricade
on
the
neck
others
are
in
the
field
planting
and
hoeing
while
yet
another
company
is
in
the
shipyard
on
the
mystic
river
ten
or
twelve
of
the
people
are
constantly
fishing
or
hunting
to
add
to
the
food
supply
while
those
servingmen
or
laborers
who
are
not
skilled
at
other
work
are
cutting
trees
into
fuel
and
otherwise
clearing
the
land
that
it
may
be
tilled
another
year
illustration
the
women
and
children
are
no
less
busy
and
it
is
easy
for
you
to
guess
what
their
duties
are
these
log
houses
while
not
requiring
as
much
care
as
if
they
were
mansions
need
very
much
in
the
way
of
woman
work
lest
the
shiftless
ones
who
have
no
pride
in
the
appearance
of
the
town
or
are
too
lazy
to
do
other
than
what
may
be
absolutely
necessary
should
allow
the
dirt
to
gather
round
about
the
outside
of
the
houses
a
law
has
been
made
obliging
each
person
to
keep
free
from
dirt
or
filth
of
any
kind
all
the
land
surrounding
his
dwelling
for
a
distance
of
fifty
paces
whether
in
the
street
or
garden
and
it
is
upon
us
children
that
this
last
work
falls
save
for
the
babies
and
those
who
are
abed
with
sickness
there
are
no
idle
ones
in
boston
and
well
indeed
it
should
be
so
for
it
surely
is
true
that
satan
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
if
we
were
not
busily
engaged
during
all
the
waking
hours
then
would
we
have
opportunity
to
grow
homesick
for
much
as
we
are
growing
to
like
this
new
world
there
will
come
now
and
then
thoughts
of
the
homes
we
left
in
england
and
one
heart
falls
sad
at
realizing
that
perhaps
never
again
will
we
see
those
whom
we
left
behind
when
the
sailed
out
of
southampton
launching
the
ship
it
is
not
well
that
i
let
my
mind
go
back
into
the
past
i
should
think
only
of
the
future
and
of
what
we
are
doing
here
in
boston
the
most
important
of
which
just
now
is
the
launching
of
our
ship
she
is
what
sailors
call
bark
rigged
which
is
the
same
as
saying
that
she
has
three
masts
but
yet
not
as
much
of
rigging
as
a
ship
her
name
painted
on
the
stern
is
of
the
and
there
is
hardly
any
need
for
me
to
say
that
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
town
stood
near
at
hand
to
see
her
as
she
slipped
down
the
well
greased
ways
into
the
river
where
she
rode
as
gracefully
as
a
swan
i
have
already
said
that
when
the
came
in
at
the
time
of
the
famine
she
appeared
the
most
beautiful
vessel
i
had
ever
seen
and
next
to
her
comes
the
of
the
as
governor
winthrop
said
in
the
short
lecture
he
gave
us
before
launching
she
was
boston
made
of
boston
timber
and
would
be
sailed
by
boston
sailors
so
that
when
she
goes
out
across
the
ocean
people
shall
know
that
there
are
englishmen
far
overseas
who
are
striving
with
god
help
to
make
a
country
which
shall
one
day
stand
equal
with
the
england
we
have
left
forever
illustration
it
is
while
speaking
of
the
launching
that
i
am
reminded
of
a
very
comical
mishap
to
master
winthrop
and
i
may
set
it
down
without
disrespect
to
him
for
he
is
pleased
to
join
in
the
mirth
whenever
it
is
spoken
of
as
something
to
cause
laughter
master
winthrop
mishap
it
seems
that
the
wolves
had
been
worrying
some
of
the
goats
that
master
winthrop
brought
over
to
this
country
with
him
and
on
a
certain
day
after
supper
he
went
out
with
his
gun
in
the
hope
of
killing
a
few
of
the
ravenous
beasts
he
had
not
traveled
more
than
half
a
mile
from
home
when
night
came
on
and
turning
about
to
go
back
as
was
prudent
for
it
is
not
safe
that
one
man
shall
be
alone
in
the
forest
after
dark
because
of
the
wild
animals
he
mistook
his
path
wandering
directly
away
from
the
river
instead
of
toward
it
i
myself
have
heard
him
say
that
he
must
have
walked
a
full
hour
and
was
growing
exceeding
uncomfortable
in
mind
when
he
came
to
an
indian
hut
that
was
built
of
branches
of
trees
and
of
skins
so
that
it
formed
a
fairly
comfortable
dwelling
and
was
of
sufficient
strength
to
resist
the
efforts
of
any
one
to
enter
save
through
the
door
there
was
no
person
inside
this
hut
or
wigwam
the
door
was
unfastened
and
the
governor
understanding
that
he
must
have
some
shelter
during
the
night
else
was
he
in
danger
of
being
devoured
by
wild
beasts
entered
as
if
it
were
his
own
dwelling
with
his
flint
and
steel
he
built
a
fire
and
by
its
light
saw
piled
up
in
one
corner
of
the
place
mats
such
as
the
savages
use
to
sleep
upon
having
taken
a
mouthful
of
snakeweed
which
is
said
to
be
of
great
benefit
in
quieting
one
nerves
and
prayed
to
god
for
safe
keeping
during
the
night
he
lay
down
before
much
time
had
passed
and
certainly
while
his
eyes
were
yet
wide
open
it
began
to
rain
and
some
of
the
water
finding
its
way
through
the
carelessly
thatched
roof
disturbed
his
rest
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
he
spent
the
night
singing
psalms
gathering
such
wood
as
he
could
handily
come
at
from
the
outside
to
keep
the
fire
going
and
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
narrow
space
until
near
to
daylight
when
an
indian
squaw
came
that
way
illustration
the
governor
hearing
her
voice
as
she
cried
out
to
whosoever
owned
the
hut
and
was
evidently
a
friend
of
hers
barred
the
door
as
best
he
might
while
she
stood
on
the
outside
beating
it
with
her
hands
and
calling
aloud
in
the
indian
language
first
in
friendly
terms
and
then
angrily
but
yet
he
made
no
reply
the
door
held
firm
against
her
efforts
until
day
came
when
the
governor
walked
out
of
the
hut
not
dreaming
the
woman
would
make
an
attack
upon
him
but
straightway
he
was
forced
to
take
to
his
heels
or
as
he
laughingly
declared
she
would
have
clawed
out
his
eyes
although
we
children
knew
nothing
whatsoever
concerning
it
the
chief
men
of
the
town
had
been
greatly
alarmed
because
of
the
disappearance
and
during
the
whole
of
the
night
no
less
than
twenty
had
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
forest
hunting
for
him
but
by
an
unkind
chance
never
going
in
the
direction
of
this
hut
when
master
winthrop
made
his
appearance
it
had
just
been
decided
that
a
hue
and
cry
should
be
raised
and
all
the
men
in
boston
be
called
to
aid
in
the
search
new
arrivals
it
was
during
this
summer
when
captain
pierce
brought
the
to
us
for
the
third
time
that
mistress
winthrop
the
governor
wife
came
over
john
eliot
the
preacher
was
also
one
of
the
passengers
and
they
had
even
a
longer
voyage
than
had
we
in
the
the
left
southampton
about
the
middle
of
august
and
did
not
arrive
here
until
the
fourth
of
november
when
she
came
to
anchor
off
nantasket
then
indeed
did
we
have
a
week
of
rejoicing
sharing
in
the
gladness
that
his
family
was
with
him
once
more
all
those
who
could
get
boats
to
convey
them
went
down
off
nantasket
and
when
mistress
winthrop
stepped
ashore
at
the
foot
of
our
cove
she
was
honored
by
volleys
from
all
the
firearms
in
the
town
illustration
during
three
days
that
followed
it
was
as
if
the
people
believed
master
winthrop
and
his
loved
ones
were
in
danger
of
starvation
for
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
in
the
town
each
brought
some
gift
of
food
such
as
fat
hogs
goats
deer
meat
geese
partridges
in
fact
anything
that
could
be
eaten
save
clams
fish
and
lobsters
of
which
we
had
already
more
than
plenty
enough
to
dull
one
appetite
for
such
eating
those
who
read
what
i
have
here
set
down
may
charge
me
with
speaking
overly
much
concerning
what
we
had
to
eat
and
yet
i
question
whether
any
of
our
company
who
passed
through
the
famine
of
the
year
of
and
the
pinching
times
of
and
could
do
otherwise
than
dwell
upon
our
store
of
food
another
famine
illustration
now
if
you
please
i
will
set
down
at
once
that
which
is
in
my
mind
concerning
it
so
that
i
need
not
weary
you
by
repeating
this
first
year
of
harvest
was
a
fairly
plentiful
one
and
would
have
sufficed
for
all
our
wants
during
the
coming
winter
had
it
not
been
that
other
people
were
joining
us
by
every
ship
nearly
all
of
whom
were
poorly
provided
for
having
left
england
in
the
belief
that
we
were
dwelling
amid
plenty
therefore
it
was
that
to
feed
these
new
comers
as
well
as
ourselves
we
were
frequently
hard
pressed
for
what
was
actually
needed
to
save
ourselves
the
pangs
of
hunger
it
is
true
that
during
this
summer
of
many
cattle
were
sent
from
england
but
so
many
died
during
the
voyage
that
those
which
lived
seemed
extremely
precious
because
from
them
were
we
counting
on
our
future
herds
people
who
had
spent
their
money
in
england
buying
twenty
cows
but
succeeded
in
bringing
to
boston
only
four
could
not
afford
to
kill
them
for
the
sake
of
meat
more
especially
since
the
very
life
of
our
colony
depended
upon
their
increase
we
had
famine
in
the
first
year
we
were
cramped
for
food
during
the
second
year
yet
consoled
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
when
another
season
had
come
there
would
be
so
much
seed
put
into
the
ground
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
lack
of
whatever
might
be
needed
but
the
summer
of
our
third
year
in
boston
was
cold
and
wet
the
crop
of
corn
failed
almost
entirely
and
again
were
we
forced
to
seek
our
food
from
the
sea
or
to
dig
for
clams
but
even
this
last
was
extremely
difficult
owing
to
the
exceedingly
cold
winter
of
that
season
the
charles
river
was
frozen
from
shore
to
shore
and
it
was
as
if
the
snow
fell
almost
every
day
until
the
drifts
were
piled
so
high
roundabout
our
town
that
save
in
the
very
center
of
the
village
we
could
not
move
about
another
famine
was
staring
us
in
the
face
when
the
winter
came
to
an
end
and
we
knew
that
unless
help
should
reach
us
from
the
outside
we
could
not
add
to
our
stores
until
another
harvest
time
then
it
was
that
we
realized
the
value
of
having
neighbors
and
truly
these
were
neighbors
indeed
who
at
jamestown
in
the
new
world
had
such
store
of
food
as
would
allow
them
to
lade
a
ship
wholly
with
corn
sending
her
through
god
direction
to
that
port
where
the
supply
was
most
needed
lest
i
weary
you
with
too
many
words
regarding
our
hunger
i
will
set
it
down
thus
briefly
that
except
at
rare
intervals
we
were
pinched
for
food
during
the
first
five
years
we
lived
in
boston
and
not
until
that
time
had
passed
were
we
free
from
further
fear
of
famine
fine
clothing
forbidden
and
yet
we
did
not
spend
all
our
time
complaining
one
to
another
lest
on
the
morrow
we
should
be
hungry
and
in
proof
of
this
i
am
minded
to
set
down
here
that
which
i
have
copied
from
the
law
made
in
our
town
four
years
after
we
came
across
from
charlestown
that
no
person
either
man
or
woman
shall
hereafter
make
or
buy
any
apparel
either
woolen
or
silk
or
linen
with
any
lace
on
it
silver
gold
or
thread
under
the
penalty
of
forfeiture
of
said
cloths
also
that
no
person
either
man
or
woman
shall
make
or
buy
any
slashed
cloths
other
than
one
slash
in
each
sleeve
and
another
in
the
back
also
all
embroideries
or
capbands
and
rails
are
forbidden
hereafter
to
be
made
and
worn
under
the
aforesaid
penalty
also
all
gold
and
silver
girdles
hatbands
belts
ruffs
beaver
hats
are
prohibited
to
be
bought
and
worn
hereafter
mother
says
it
is
because
of
our
people
having
given
themselves
up
to
vanity
that
the
lord
laid
his
hand
heavily
upon
us
by
cutting
off
the
harvest
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
although
i
question
not
that
which
she
has
said
that
the
good
god
would
never
punish
all
our
people
for
the
sin
which
a
few
committed
yet
perhaps
there
were
more
than
a
few
who
committed
the
sin
else
why
should
it
have
been
that
our
wise
men
felt
it
necessary
to
forbid
fanciful
dress
as
they
did
in
this
law
which
i
have
set
down
our
first
church
not
until
the
second
year
after
boston
was
settled
did
we
have
a
building
devoted
entirely
to
the
worship
of
god
then
was
built
of
logs
neatly
hewn
and
set
together
with
much
care
so
that
both
the
outside
and
the
inside
were
smooth
and
fair
to
look
upon
that
which
we
called
our
church
the
sides
did
not
stand
as
tall
as
some
of
our
dwellings
but
the
roof
was
much
higher
and
sharper
so
that
inside
it
looked
to
be
very
large
there
were
four
windows
in
each
side
and
all
of
them
contained
glass
if
you
please
illustration
the
pulpit
with
a
well
fashioned
of
odorous
cedar
above
it
stood
at
the
end
of
the
building
farthest
from
the
door
and
there
were
near
about
it
eight
pews
made
much
after
the
same
shape
as
those
in
the
church
at
home
in
these
sit
the
magistrates
the
elders
and
the
deacons
with
the
men
on
one
side
the
women
and
girls
on
the
other
and
the
boys
in
one
corner
where
the
may
keep
them
in
order
back
of
these
pews
were
benches
sufficient
in
number
to
give
seats
to
all
our
people
and
if
it
could
have
been
that
master
winthrop
and
those
in
authority
believed
we
might
worship
god
quite
as
well
while
comfortable
in
body
so
that
we
had
a
fireplace
it
would
have
delighted
me
much
it
seems
almost
a
sin
to
complain
because
of
being
cold
while
one
is
praising
god
and
yet
during
this
long
dreary
winter
when
the
earth
was
piled
high
with
snow
and
the
river
imprisoned
in
ice
it
was
well
nigh
impossible
after
having
remained
in
the
same
position
two
or
three
hours
to
prevent
one
teeth
from
chattering
so
sharply
that
the
noise
might
disturb
others
it
seems
to
me
that
one
could
enjoy
a
sermon
much
better
if
one
were
not
wishing
for
the
warmth
of
the
fireplace
at
home
many
of
our
people
have
what
is
called
a
to
take
with
them
to
meeting
and
it
seems
to
me
a
most
comfortable
arrangement
but
mother
says
that
if
our
love
of
god
be
not
strong
enough
to
prevent
discomfort
simply
because
of
the
frost
when
such
a
man
as
master
wilson
or
either
of
the
preachers
or
governor
winthrop
is
pleased
to
deliver
a
sermon
then
are
we
utterly
lost
illustration
susan
declares
that
she
lost
the
first
winter
we
came
here
when
her
cheeks
were
during
one
of
master
winthrop
lectures
which
took
no
more
than
two
hours
in
the
speaking
these
which
i
wish
most
fervently
my
father
would
believe
we
might
be
permitted
to
use
are
square
boxes
made
of
iron
pierced
with
many
tiny
holes
and
having
a
handle
by
which
they
can
be
carried
one
of
these
filled
with
live
coals
will
keep
warm
a
very
long
time
especially
if
it
be
covered
with
skins
and
i
envy
mistress
winthrop
and
her
daughter
even
while
knowing
how
great
is
the
sin
when
they
sit
in
the
governor
pew
so
comfortably
warm
that
there
is
no
fear
their
teeth
will
by
chattering
cause
unseemly
disturbance
a
troublesome
person
there
are
certain
matters
concerning
which
i
was
minded
not
to
speak
because
of
their
causing
both
susan
and
me
very
much
of
sadness
at
the
time
and
it
has
seemed
as
if
i
had
set
down
little
else
except
trouble
and
suffering
whereas
there
was
very
much
of
the
time
when
we
of
boston
enjoyed
our
life
in
the
new
world
that
some
will
not
live
as
god
would
have
them
we
know
only
too
well
and
we
found
one
such
among
us
during
the
second
year
after
our
village
was
built
thomas
morton
was
the
person
who
gave
the
officers
of
boston
no
little
trouble
and
in
order
to
tell
understandingly
the
story
of
what
he
did
i
must
go
back
to
that
time
two
years
before
we
landed
here
when
the
people
of
plymouth
had
cause
to
complain
against
this
same
man
from
what
i
have
heard
father
say
he
had
been
a
lawyer
in
the
city
of
london
and
came
over
to
plymouth
hoping
to
better
his
fortunes
but
because
of
not
being
a
man
the
religious
spirit
of
the
colonies
was
little
to
his
liking
the
village
of
merry
mount
within
five
or
six
miles
of
where
stands
our
village
had
been
a
few
years
before
a
settlement
which
one
captain
wollaston
began
and
tiring
of
the
enterprise
went
back
to
england
leaving
there
some
few
of
his
followers
who
were
ungodly
people
this
thomas
morton
believing
himself
held
in
too
close
restraint
at
plymouth
sought
out
these
people
at
wollaston
and
became
one
of
them
to
the
shame
and
reproach
of
all
people
in
this
new
world
he
changed
the
name
of
the
village
to
merry
mount
was
chosen
leader
of
the
company
there
and
made
of
the
place
a
perfect
sodom
it
is
said
so
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
they
had
no
religious
services
save
now
and
then
when
in
a
spirit
of
wickedness
this
thomas
morton
read
from
the
prayer
book
he
increased
the
number
of
his
following
by
enticing
the
servants
away
from
the
good
folks
of
plymouth
it
gave
much
offence
to
them
that
such
a
village
should
be
in
the
land
where
they
had
come
to
set
up
the
true
worship
of
god
therefore
captain
miles
standish
a
soldier
of
plymouth
went
with
a
force
of
men
to
merry
mount
seized
this
thomas
morton
and
sent
him
to
england
that
he
might
answer
for
his
crimes
to
the
london
company
illustration
punishing
thomas
morton
what
happened
there
my
father
does
not
know
but
certain
it
is
that
when
the
came
on
her
second
voyage
she
brought
among
her
passengers
this
same
thomas
morton
and
from
the
moment
he
arrived
our
people
had
trouble
with
him
he
brought
considerable
property
in
the
way
of
firearms
powder
and
shot
and
without
asking
permission
from
the
chief
men
of
our
town
set
about
trading
these
goods
with
the
indians
for
furs
as
he
had
done
at
merry
mount
which
was
not
only
a
menace
to
all
the
white
people
in
this
new
country
because
of
furnishing
the
savages
with
arms
that
might
be
used
to
kill
us
but
directly
against
the
law
which
forbade
trafficking
with
the
indians
he
must
have
been
a
wicked
man
indeed
for
not
content
with
doing
that
which
our
people
had
forbidden
he
cheated
the
savages
by
selling
them
black
sand
for
powder
and
demanding
more
of
furs
than
was
fair
and
just
for
such
goods
as
he
gave
them
of
course
one
may
think
that
his
crime
against
us
was
lessened
when
he
weighed
out
worthless
sand
instead
of
powder
that
might
be
used
to
our
harm
but
the
chief
men
of
boston
claimed
that
the
savages
must
be
dealt
with
fairly
otherwise
would
they
look
upon
us
who
were
willing
to
trade
honestly
as
rogues
and
thieves
therefore
it
was
that
our
people
seized
this
thomas
morton
gave
him
fair
trial
before
the
court
and
sentenced
him
to
four
and
twenty
hours
in
the
bilboes
after
which
he
was
again
to
be
sent
as
prisoner
to
england
it
may
be
that
some
do
not
know
what
bilboes
are
and
i
can
explain
because
of
having
seen
them
while
they
were
on
thomas
morton
a
bilboe
is
a
long
bar
of
iron
on
which
are
two
heavy
clamps
in
shape
not
unlike
bracelets
which
ladies
of
quality
wear
upon
their
arms
fastened
by
a
ring
to
the
bar
in
such
manner
that
they
may
slide
back
and
forth
these
clamps
or
clasps
are
placed
upon
the
prisoner
ankles
and
pushed
apart
until
his
legs
are
stretched
wide
his
hands
are
tied
behind
his
back
and
he
is
forced
to
sit
upon
the
ground
unable
to
give
relief
to
his
aching
limbs
because
of
the
bar
being
too
weighty
for
him
to
move
it
illustration
all
of
thomas
morton
goods
were
seized
to
pay
the
charges
of
the
trial
and
also
to
make
good
to
the
indians
what
they
had
lost
through
his
knavishness
the
house
which
he
had
built
and
it
was
a
fair
one
made
of
heavy
logs
was
burned
in
the
presence
of
the
prisoner
and
the
court
as
a
sign
that
we
of
boston
would
not
countenance
dishonest
tricks
even
when
they
were
played
upon
the
savages
philip
ratcliff
crime
the
punishment
of
thomas
morton
saddened
susan
and
myself
sorely
but
not
so
much
as
when
one
philip
ratcliff
was
punished
he
was
such
a
wicked
man
that
he
went
around
the
town
saying
he
believed
the
devil
was
at
the
head
of
our
church
and
in
every
way
casting
reproach
upon
religion
despite
the
fact
of
his
having
been
warned
again
and
again
that
unless
he
put
a
bridle
to
his
tongue
punishment
would
speedily
follow
he
did
not
give
heed
to
the
warning
however
and
after
a
time
which
was
during
the
third
summer
of
our
being
in
this
land
he
was
brought
before
the
court
as
one
who
had
cast
reproach
upon
god
for
this
he
was
sentenced
to
be
whipped
to
have
his
ears
cut
off
to
be
fined
forty
shillings
and
afterward
to
be
banished
to
england
because
of
this
man
being
so
very
very
wicked
susan
and
i
believed
we
should
go
to
see
him
whipped
and
gathered
with
the
people
at
the
pillory
where
he
stood
with
his
neck
and
arms
clutched
by
the
heavy
bars
of
wood
but
when
samuel
morgan
made
ready
the
heavy
whip
just
as
the
man
back
was
bared
to
receive
the
lashes
we
turned
away
in
horror
not
daring
to
look
father
said
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
that
ratcliff
bore
the
whipping
and
the
without
a
cry
but
when
it
was
over
he
threatened
vengeance
against
us
after
he
should
be
set
free
in
england
and
later
we
came
to
know
what
he
meant
by
such
threats
illustration
he
went
everywhere
about
in
the
old
country
telling
that
the
new
world
was
a
hideous
wilderness
in
which
roamed
the
wildest
savages
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
white
people
that
the
land
was
rocky
and
barren
and
not
fit
for
farms
for
no
crops
could
be
raised
upon
it
that
the
weather
was
cold
and
that
the
climate
caused
deathly
sickness
all
this
father
said
worked
to
our
harm
among
those
godly
people
who
were
inclined
to
join
us
for
they
feared
to
come
into
such
a
place
not
understanding
that
these
things
were
lies
which
had
been
told
out
of
a
spirit
of
revenge
in
the
pillory
another
wicked
person
who
had
come
to
boston
was
henry
linn
who
was
no
sooner
living
among
us
than
he
wrote
letters
to
england
by
every
vessel
full
of
slander
against
the
churches
and
of
those
who
took
part
in
the
government
he
was
forced
to
stand
in
the
pillory
from
sunrise
to
sunset
and
was
then
sent
back
to
england
with
the
warning
that
if
he
ever
returned
worse
punishment
would
follow
it
has
come
to
my
mind
that
possibly
some
who
read
these
words
may
not
have
seen
a
pillory
for
i
am
told
that
there
are
places
in
this
world
where
the
people
so
fear
god
and
love
their
neighbors
that
there
is
no
need
they
be
punished
therefore
will
i
set
down
as
best
i
may
a
description
of
that
instrument
of
shame
that
stands
near
to
where
lives
master
wilson
first
a
platform
of
logs
is
made
of
such
height
that
he
who
stands
upon
it
can
be
seen
of
all
the
people
and
from
the
center
of
this
rises
a
stout
log
to
the
height
of
four
feet
or
more
on
the
top
of
the
upright
timber
and
fastened
immovable
is
a
puncheon
plank
on
the
upper
edge
of
which
are
cut
three
grooves
the
middle
one
large
enough
to
contain
a
man
neck
and
the
other
two
his
wrists
now
a
second
plank
is
fashioned
to
fit
down
over
the
first
one
with
other
grooves
in
it
to
match
whosoever
must
be
punished
is
forced
to
stand
upon
this
platform
with
his
head
and
arms
fastened
securely
in
the
holes
of
the
planks
exposed
to
the
view
of
all
the
people
during
so
long
a
time
as
the
sentence
demands
in
addition
to
being
a
most
shameful
punishment
it
must
be
exceeding
painful
for
one
may
not
stand
very
long
in
the
same
position
without
becoming
cramped
and
he
who
is
in
the
pillory
can
not
move
hands
or
head
stealing
from
the
indians
i
grieve
to
say
that
there
were
some
among
our
people
who
seemed
to
believe
there
was
nothing
of
crime
that
could
be
committed
against
a
savage
and
master
josias
plastow
whom
we
had
ever
looked
upon
as
a
godly
man
showed
himself
to
be
knavish
where
the
brown
people
were
concerned
chickatabut
the
chief
of
the
massachusetts
indians
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
brought
proof
to
boston
that
master
plastow
had
stolen
three
of
corn
from
some
of
his
people
living
near
neponset
and
on
being
charged
with
the
offence
by
governor
winthrop
master
plastow
confessed
that
he
had
done
so
claiming
that
it
was
not
stealing
to
take
from
the
savages
illustration
the
governor
and
his
assistants
thought
differently
though
for
master
plastow
was
fined
five
pounds
in
money
and
ordered
to
send
six
of
corn
to
the
indians
from
whom
he
had
stolen
after
which
all
people
were
forbidden
to
call
him
master
any
more
but
must
give
him
only
the
name
of
josias
captain
stone
believed
this
sentence
to
be
wrong
and
openly
called
the
justice
unseemly
names
he
was
straightway
summoned
before
the
court
and
fined
one
hundred
pounds
in
money
for
speaking
disrespectfully
of
one
in
authority
nor
was
this
the
only
case
where
fault
was
found
with
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
josias
henry
lyon
wrote
a
letter
to
a
cousin
of
his
in
plymouth
another
to
a
friend
in
salem
and
sent
four
to
london
all
of
which
were
filled
with
harsh
words
against
the
governor
of
boston
and
the
manner
in
which
justice
was
dealt
out
he
was
given
twelve
lashes
on
the
bare
back
and
banished
to
england
the
passing
of
new
laws
when
we
had
been
in
this
village
two
years
there
was
much
vexation
because
of
the
greater
portion
of
the
gold
and
silver
money
which
our
people
had
brought
with
them
having
been
sent
back
to
england
in
order
to
purchase
goods
there
and
the
result
was
that
even
those
who
were
well
off
in
the
things
of
this
world
found
themselves
unable
to
pay
their
debts
therefore
it
was
that
the
court
ordered
corn
to
be
taken
in
the
stead
of
gold
and
silver
unless
money
or
beaver
skins
were
set
down
in
the
writing
as
the
method
of
payment
agreed
upon
at
the
same
time
another
law
was
passed
part
of
which
seemed
to
bear
heavily
upon
those
who
were
homesick
to
the
point
of
going
back
to
england
and
yet
may
have
offended
the
officers
of
the
law
in
some
way
it
was
declared
that
no
person
should
be
allowed
to
depart
out
of
the
town
of
boston
either
by
sea
or
by
land
or
to
buy
goods
out
of
any
vessel
or
of
the
indians
without
permission
from
the
magistrates
i
know
it
is
not
seemly
for
a
girl
to
question
that
which
her
elders
have
done
and
yet
there
were
many
times
when
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
such
a
law
worked
injury
to
us
of
boston
i
might
not
have
given
so
much
heed
to
matters
which
do
not
concern
girls
but
for
the
fact
that
susan
father
had
crossed
the
neck
on
his
way
in
search
of
wild
animals
and
having
come
some
four
miles
into
the
forest
he
met
an
indian
who
had
on
his
back
a
of
corn
in
a
basket
the
savage
took
a
fancy
to
the
girdle
he
wore
offered
to
give
him
the
corn
and
bring
as
much
more
on
the
following
day
if
the
belt
were
given
to
him
then
illustration
susan
father
believing
that
the
law
against
buying
provisions
of
an
indian
would
not
be
carried
so
far
as
to
prevent
a
bargain
like
the
one
which
the
savage
had
offered
stripped
off
his
belt
and
took
the
corn
on
coming
back
to
the
town
samuel
goodlove
one
of
the
met
him
and
asked
how
it
chanced
he
had
set
forth
in
search
of
wild
fowl
and
brought
back
corn
thinking
no
harm
susan
father
told
all
that
had
been
done
in
the
forest
and
straightway
he
was
brought
before
governor
winthrop
who
fined
him
ten
shillings
and
the
corn
he
had
brought
on
his
back
four
miles
for
having
offended
the
law
in
addition
he
was
sentenced
to
give
back
to
the
indian
as
much
corn
as
he
had
taken
but
without
demanding
from
him
the
girdle
that
had
been
given
over
master
pormont
school
five
years
after
we
were
settled
in
this
town
of
boston
a
school
was
set
up
for
young
people
and
such
children
of
the
indians
as
wished
to
attend
were
allowed
to
do
so
freely
without
payment
although
every
white
man
was
forced
to
pay
each
year
a
certain
amount
either
in
money
or
in
goods
for
the
hire
of
the
teacher
who
was
master
philemon
pormont
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
we
children
knew
nothing
whatsoever
of
reading
writing
or
of
doing
small
sums
in
arithmetic
up
to
this
time
a
certain
portion
of
each
day
did
my
mother
or
father
teach
me
my
lessons
and
when
master
pormont
opened
his
school
i
could
write
as
fair
a
hand
as
i
do
now
which
seems
fortunate
for
he
was
not
skilful
in
teaching
the
art
of
writing
as
for
myself
i
truly
believe
that
had
my
first
lessons
in
the
use
of
a
quill
come
from
him
i
had
never
known
how
to
form
a
letter
because
of
his
being
exceeding
harsh
in
his
ways
illustration
a
child
who
failed
in
doing
at
the
first
attempt
exactly
as
master
pormont
thought
fit
was
given
a
sharp
blow
over
the
knuckles
of
the
hand
which
held
the
quill
and
ezra
whitman
was
punished
in
this
manner
so
severely
on
a
certain
day
that
it
was
nearly
a
week
before
he
was
able
to
use
his
fingers
even
then
the
teacher
declared
that
if
the
blow
had
been
sharper
the
boy
would
before
the
pain
had
ceased
have
known
more
about
that
which
he
was
endeavoring
to
show
him
the
school
was
first
set
up
in
the
house
that
had
been
built
by
josias
plastow
if
you
remember
he
was
one
who
had
been
under
the
discipline
of
the
court
and
it
was
forbidden
any
should
call
him
save
by
the
name
of
josias
feeling
that
he
had
been
harshly
dealt
with
josias
left
boston
and
went
into
plymouth
to
live
therefore
did
his
dwelling
belong
to
the
town
according
to
the
law
it
was
made
into
a
schoolroom
by
having
benches
set
up
around
the
four
sides
in
such
fashion
that
the
scholars
faced
a
ledge
of
puncheon
planks
which
was
built
against
the
walls
to
be
used
when
we
needed
a
desk
on
which
to
write
or
to
work
out
sums
in
arithmetic
master
pormont
sat
upon
a
platform
in
the
center
of
the
room
where
he
could
keep
us
children
well
in
view
and
woe
betide
the
one
who
neglected
his
task
for
punishment
was
certain
to
follow
school
discipline
there
were
times
when
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
master
pormont
had
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
for
once
when
i
ventured
to
ask
susan
freeman
for
the
loan
of
her
quill
while
he
was
looking
in
the
opposite
direction
i
was
speedily
called
to
an
account
for
misbehavior
then
it
was
he
handed
me
a
knife
he
carried
in
his
pocket
and
further
command
was
not
needed
i
knew
full
well
that
i
must
go
outside
and
cut
a
stout
switch
for
use
upon
my
own
body
and
if
peradventure
i
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
bring
back
a
small
one
the
first
would
have
been
used
to
switch
me
with
until
it
was
broken
after
which
it
was
my
duty
to
go
for
another
of
more
weight
illustration
my
hands
smarted
a
full
hour
after
the
punishment
had
been
dealt
out
and
there
were
such
swellings
upon
them
when
i
got
home
that
mother
tied
both
up
in
linen
after
besmearing
them
plentifully
with
ointment
it
was
not
always
that
master
pormont
used
a
switch
upon
a
child
who
had
been
foolish
enough
to
speak
with
his
neighbor
for
he
had
what
were
called
which
were
most
disagreeable
to
wear
and
caused
a
great
deal
of
pain
so
susan
said
but
as
for
myself
i
was
never
forced
to
bear
such
punishment
these
were
stout
bits
of
wood
from
the
oak
tree
which
could
not
readily
be
broken
by
the
teeth
and
were
put
into
a
child
mouth
as
you
thrust
a
bit
into
the
mouth
of
a
horse
after
which
the
two
ends
were
bound
securely
back
of
the
neck
thus
the
unfortunate
one
jaws
were
stretched
wide
open
oftentimes
for
a
full
hour
other
tools
of
torture
it
seemed
to
me
then
and
does
even
now
that
master
pormont
spent
more
time
devising
means
of
punishment
than
in
teaching
us
our
lessons
for
he
had
as
many
torture
tools
of
various
kinds
as
would
have
served
to
make
a
heavy
load
for
either
of
us
children
that
which
the
lads
most
feared
was
the
flapper
and
truly
it
was
well
contrived
to
cause
pain
it
was
a
piece
of
stout
deer
hide
or
thick
leather
four
or
five
inches
wide
and
twice
as
long
with
a
hole
in
the
center
about
as
large
as
the
end
of
my
thumb
one
end
of
this
was
tied
to
a
stout
handle
and
when
applying
it
master
pormont
forced
the
child
who
had
disobeyed
the
rules
of
school
to
lie
over
one
of
the
benches
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
come
at
the
lad
bare
skin
when
the
flapper
was
laid
on
vigorously
at
each
blow
the
flesh
would
puff
up
through
this
hole
in
the
center
of
the
leather
in
a
way
most
painful
to
behold
there
is
little
need
for
me
to
say
that
master
pormont
had
a
number
of
dunce
caps
made
of
bark
from
the
birch
tree
on
which
were
painted
different
inscriptions
to
suit
the
offence
such
as
stupid
boy
for
one
who
could
not
readily
answer
the
questions
he
asked
concerning
the
day
lessons
a
silly
dunce
to
fit
one
who
was
slow
in
learning
a
wicked
liar
for
some
lad
who
had
not
told
the
truth
in
fact
i
can
not
set
down
all
the
names
which
master
pormont
had
written
on
these
dunce
caps
and
there
was
hardly
an
hour
during
the
day
when
at
least
one
of
them
was
not
in
use
illustration
that
contrivance
which
he
had
for
children
who
would
not
sit
quietly
on
their
benches
was
seemingly
the
most
innocent
and
yet
as
i
know
to
my
sorrow
caused
a
vast
amount
of
pain
it
was
a
small
square
of
puncheon
plank
with
a
single
stick
in
the
center
as
a
leg
and
on
this
the
culprit
was
forced
to
sit
balancing
himself
or
herself
as
best
might
be
by
the
feet
without
being
allowed
to
touch
the
hands
to
anything
as
i
thus
set
down
the
poor
description
it
seems
a
harmless
thing
and
a
punishment
too
mild
to
meet
a
grave
offence
but
yet
if
you
were
to
try
to
balance
yourself
on
this
unipod
as
master
pormont
called
it
for
the
space
of
an
hour
every
joint
in
your
body
would
cry
aloud
with
pain
as
for
myself
i
know
that
more
than
once
i
would
rather
have
fallen
headlong
from
this
unipod
than
have
endured
the
torture
a
single
moment
even
had
i
not
known
that
more
severe
punishment
would
follow
such
a
disregard
of
the
rules
of
school
difficult
lessons
the
first
lesson
which
master
pormont
gave
to
those
of
us
children
who
could
read
and
write
fairly
well
was
from
the
latin
grammar
and
he
required
that
we
have
at
our
tongue
end
within
the
first
day
the
different
forms
of
no
less
than
six
verbs
and
this
regardless
of
the
fact
that
we
had
never
so
much
as
put
our
eyes
to
the
language
before
do
not
let
it
be
understood
that
i
am
in
any
way
complaining
of
whatsoever
master
pormont
did
for
although
i
could
not
understand
the
reason
for
many
of
the
lessons
at
that
time
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
so
wise
a
man
as
he
knew
what
was
best
suited
for
us
children
but
surely
to
susan
and
me
who
knew
no
more
of
arithmetic
than
was
to
be
found
in
the
multiplying
dividing
and
adding
of
small
sums
it
was
most
grievous
work
to
stumble
over
such
terms
as
fret
tare
and
net
when
we
had
no
idea
of
their
meaning
nor
would
master
pormont
give
us
such
information
claiming
that
we
should
seek
it
from
our
parents
or
from
other
people
in
the
town
to
the
end
that
if
it
was
gained
by
much
labor
we
would
the
longer
remember
it
other
schools
to
me
it
was
a
great
relief
when
dame
schools
were
established
and
by
this
term
i
mean
schools
that
were
taught
by
women
some
of
our
more
people
believed
master
methods
were
too
harsh
for
the
younger
children
therefore
after
he
had
kept
school
one
year
mistress
sowerby
who
was
the
widow
of
master
sowerby
who
had
been
assistant
in
the
church
at
yarmouth
in
england
was
hired
at
the
wage
of
six
pounds
a
year
to
teach
the
girls
and
the
smaller
boys
she
did
not
appear
to
think
it
necessary
that
young
ladies
should
know
so
very
much
concerning
latin
grammar
or
arithmetic
but
rather
spent
her
time
showing
us
how
to
spin
tow
strings
or
to
knit
hose
or
stockings
because
of
the
school
having
been
set
up
in
her
own
home
we
could
learn
how
to
cook
and
to
weave
and
to
knit
not
only
for
our
own
use
but
to
sell
and
any
kind
of
knitting
work
done
well
was
in
great
demand
when
i
could
do
herringbone
or
patterns
working
them
moreover
into
mittens
or
stockings
i
felt
exceeding
proud
illustration
indeed
we
had
among
us
one
girl
who
knit
into
a
single
pair
of
mittens
the
alphabet
and
a
verse
of
poetry
in
four
lines
mistress
sowerby
was
most
careful
in
teaching
us
the
use
of
the
quill
for
she
claimed
that
the
young
girl
or
young
woman
who
could
make
easy
flowing
letters
need
not
consider
herself
ignorant
even
though
she
failed
in
arithmetic
or
was
unable
to
spell
correctly
the
words
she
set
down
it
seemed
to
susan
and
me
as
if
the
people
of
boston
were
taking
great
pride
in
the
teaching
of
their
children
when
we
learned
that
four
hundred
pounds
had
been
set
aside
from
the
money
of
the
town
with
which
to
set
up
a
college
near
those
plantations
which
we
had
come
to
call
the
new
town
we
girls
were
more
than
disappointed
however
when
told
that
only
lads
would
be
allowed
to
enter
this
college
and
then
not
until
having
gained
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
elsewhere
but
yet
it
was
a
matter
in
which
we
could
take
pride
that
there
should
be
such
a
school
formed
when
only
six
years
had
passed
since
we
began
to
build
the
town
of
boston
raising
flax
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
i
failed
to
set
down
anything
concerning
the
flax
which
we
spin
because
save
for
it
we
would
have
had
nothing
of
linen
except
what
could
be
brought
from
england
there
is
no
question
but
that
every
one
who
reads
this
will
know
exactly
how
flax
is
raised
and
spun
into
cloth
but
yet
i
am
minded
to
explain
because
we
girls
of
boston
have
more
to
do
with
raising
flax
than
with
any
other
crop
it
is
sown
early
in
the
spring
and
when
the
plants
are
three
or
four
inches
high
we
girls
are
obliged
to
weed
them
and
in
so
doing
are
forced
to
go
barefoot
because
of
the
stalks
being
very
tender
and
therefore
easily
broken
down
illustration
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
child
in
town
who
fails
to
go
into
the
flax
fields
because
of
its
being
such
work
as
can
be
done
by
young
people
better
than
by
older
ones
who
are
heavier
and
more
likely
to
injure
the
plants
i
have
said
that
we
are
obliged
to
go
barefooted
but
where
there
is
a
heavy
growth
of
thistles
as
is
often
the
case
we
girls
wear
two
or
three
pairs
of
woolen
stockings
to
protect
our
feet
if
there
is
any
wind
we
must
perforce
work
facing
it
so
that
such
of
the
plants
as
may
by
accident
have
been
trodden
down
may
be
blown
back
into
place
by
the
breeze
wearying
labor
it
is
indeed
this
weeding
of
the
flax
and
yet
those
who
come
into
a
new
world
as
have
we
must
not
complain
at
whatsoever
is
set
them
to
do
for
unless
much
time
is
expended
crops
can
not
be
raised
and
we
children
of
boston
need
only
to
be
reminded
of
the
famine
when
we
are
inclined
to
laziness
in
order
to
set
us
in
motion
of
course
you
know
that
flax
is
a
pretty
plant
with
a
sweet
drooping
blue
flower
and
it
ripens
about
the
first
of
july
when
it
is
pulled
up
by
the
roots
and
laid
carefully
out
to
dry
much
as
if
one
were
making
hay
this
sort
of
work
is
always
done
by
the
men
and
boys
and
during
two
or
three
days
they
are
forced
to
turn
the
flax
again
and
again
so
that
the
sun
may
come
upon
every
part
of
it
preparing
flax
i
despair
of
trying
to
tell
any
one
who
has
never
seen
flax
prepared
how
much
and
how
many
different
kinds
of
labor
are
necessary
before
it
can
be
woven
into
the
beautiful
linen
of
which
our
mothers
are
so
proud
first
it
must
be
rippled
the
ripple
comb
is
made
of
stout
teeth
either
wood
or
iron
set
on
a
puncheon
and
the
stalks
of
flax
are
pulled
through
it
to
break
off
the
seeds
which
fall
into
a
cloth
that
has
been
spread
to
catch
them
so
they
may
be
sown
for
the
next
harvest
of
course
this
kind
of
work
is
always
done
in
the
field
and
the
stalks
are
then
tied
in
bundles
which
are
called
bates
and
stacked
up
something
after
the
shape
of
a
tent
being
high
in
the
middle
and
broadened
out
at
the
bottom
after
the
flax
has
been
exposed
to
the
weather
long
enough
to
be
perfectly
dry
then
water
must
be
sprinkled
over
it
to
rot
the
leaves
and
such
portions
of
the
stalks
as
are
not
used
illustration
then
comes
that
part
of
the
work
which
only
strong
men
can
perform
called
breaking
the
flax
to
get
from
the
center
of
the
stalks
the
hard
bun
which
is
of
no
value
this
is
done
with
a
machine
made
of
wood
as
if
you
were
to
set
three
or
four
broad
knives
on
a
bench
at
a
certain
distance
apart
with
as
many
more
on
a
lever
to
come
from
above
fitting
closely
between
the
lower
blades
the
upper
part
of
the
machine
is
pulled
down
with
force
upon
the
flax
so
that
every
portion
of
it
is
broken
after
this
comes
the
scutching
or
swingling
which
is
done
by
chopping
with
dull
knives
on
a
block
of
wood
to
take
out
the
small
pieces
of
bark
which
may
still
be
sticking
to
the
fiber
now
that
which
remains
is
made
up
into
bundles
and
pounded
again
to
clear
it
yet
more
thoroughly
of
what
is
of
no
value
after
which
it
is
hackled
and
the
fineness
of
the
flax
depends
upon
the
number
of
times
it
has
been
hackled
which
means
pulling
it
through
a
quantity
of
iron
teeth
driven
into
a
board
spinning
bleaching
and
weaving
flax
after
all
this
preparation
has
been
done
then
comes
the
spinning
which
is
of
course
the
work
of
the
women
and
girls
i
am
proud
to
say
i
could
spin
a
skein
of
thread
in
one
day
before
i
was
thirteen
years
old
and
you
must
know
that
this
is
no
mean
work
for
a
girl
since
it
is
reckoned
that
the
best
of
spinners
can
do
no
more
than
two
skeins
of
course
the
skeins
must
be
bleached
otherwise
the
cloth
made
from
them
would
look
as
if
woven
of
tow
and
this
portion
of
the
work
mother
is
always
very
careful
to
look
after
herself
the
skeins
must
stay
in
warm
water
for
at
least
four
days
and
be
wrung
out
dry
every
hour
or
two
when
the
water
is
to
be
changed
then
they
are
washed
in
a
brook
or
river
until
there
is
no
longer
any
dust
or
dirt
remaining
after
which
they
are
bricked
which
is
the
same
as
if
i
had
said
bleached
with
ashes
and
hot
water
over
and
over
again
and
afterward
left
to
remain
in
clear
water
a
full
week
illustration
then
comes
more
rinsing
beating
washing
drying
and
winding
on
bobbins
so
that
it
may
be
handy
for
the
loom
the
chief
men
in
boston
made
a
law
that
all
boys
and
girls
be
taught
to
spin
flax
and
a
certain
sum
of
money
was
set
aside
to
be
given
those
who
made
the
best
linen
that
had
been
raised
spun
and
woven
within
the
town
i
am
told
that
in
some
of
the
villages
nearabout
the
men
who
make
the
laws
have
ordered
that
every
family
shall
spin
so
many
pounds
of
flax
each
year
or
pay
a
very
large
amount
of
money
as
a
fine
for
neglecting
to
do
so
it
is
not
needed
i
should
set
down
how
flax
is
spun
for
there
is
but
one
way
to
spin
that
i
know
of
whether
the
material
be
wool
cotton
or
flax
but
i
would
i
might
be
able
so
to
set
it
down
that
whosoever
reads
could
understand
how
my
mother
wove
this
linen
thread
into
cloth
but
it
would
require
more
of
words
than
i
have
patience
to
write
if
there
be
any
who
have
the
desire
to
know
how
the
linen
for
their
tables
or
for
their
clothing
is
made
i
would
advise
that
the
matter
be
studied
as
one
would
a
lesson
in
school
for
it
is
most
interesting
and
father
holds
to
it
that
every
child
should
be
able
to
make
all
of
that
which
he
wears
what
we
girls
do
at
home
in
this
town
of
boston
if
we
do
not
know
how
to
make
what
is
needed
then
must
we
perforce
go
without
because
one
can
not
well
afford
to
spend
the
time
nor
the
money
required
to
send
from
boston
to
london
for
whatever
may
be
desired
and
wait
until
it
shall
be
brought
across
the
sea
i
wonder
if
it
would
interest
any
of
you
to
know
what
susan
and
i
are
obliged
to
do
in
our
homes
during
each
working
day
of
the
week
i
can
remember
a
time
when
we
were
put
to
it
to
perform
certain
tasks
within
six
days
and
have
set
down
that
which
we
did
it
was
on
a
monday
that
susan
and
i
hackled
fifty
pounds
of
flax
and
tired
we
were
when
the
day
was
come
to
an
end
on
tuesday
we
carded
tow
and
on
wednesday
each
spun
a
skein
of
linen
thread
on
thursday
we
did
the
same
stint
and
on
friday
made
brooms
of
guinney
wheat
straw
on
saturday
we
spun
twine
out
of
the
coarser
part
of
flax
which
is
called
tow
and
of
which
i
will
tell
you
later
illustration
all
this
we
did
in
a
single
week
in
addition
to
helping
our
mothers
about
the
house
and
had
no
idea
that
we
were
working
overly
hard
and
now
about
tow
when
flax
has
been
prepared
to
that
stage
where
it
is
to
be
hackled
the
fibers
pulled
out
by
the
comb
are
yet
further
divided
into
threads
and
laid
carefully
one
above
the
other
as
straight
as
may
be
to
these
a
certain
yellow
substance
sticks
which
we
call
tow
and
this
can
be
spun
into
coarse
stuff
for
aprons
and
mats
or
into
twine
which
by
the
way
is
not
very
strong
it
would
surprise
you
when
working
flax
to
see
to
how
small
a
bulk
it
may
be
reduced
what
seems
like
an
enormous
stack
before
being
made
ready
for
spinning
is
lessened
to
such
extent
that
you
may
readily
take
it
in
both
hands
and
then
comes
the
next
surprise
when
you
see
how
much
cloth
can
be
woven
out
of
so
small
an
amount
of
threads
as
for
myself
i
am
not
any
too
fond
of
working
amid
the
flax
save
when
it
comes
to
spinning
but
such
labor
is
greatest
pleasure
as
compared
with
which
is
to
my
mind
the
most
disagreeable
and
slovenly
of
all
the
housewife
duties
making
soap
it
seems
strange
that
some
industrious
person
who
is
not
overly
fine
in
feelings
or
in
habits
does
not
take
it
upon
himself
to
make
soap
for
sale
verily
it
would
be
better
that
a
family
like
ours
buy
a
quart
of
soap
whenever
it
is
needed
than
for
the
whole
house
to
be
turned
because
of
the
dirty
work
i
wonder
if
there
are
in
this
country
any
girls
so
fortunate
as
not
to
have
been
obliged
to
learn
how
to
make
soap
i
know
of
none
in
boston
although
it
may
be
possible
that
in
salem
where
are
some
lately
come
over
from
england
live
those
who
still
know
the
luxury
of
hard
soap
such
as
can
be
bought
in
london
for
those
fortunate
ones
i
will
set
down
how
my
mother
and
i
make
a
barrel
of
soap
for
once
we
are
forced
to
get
about
the
task
we
contrive
to
make
up
as
large
a
quantity
as
possible
first
as
you
well
know
we
save
all
the
grease
which
can
not
be
used
in
cooking
and
is
not
needed
for
candles
until
we
have
four
and
twenty
pounds
of
such
stuff
as
the
fat
of
meat
scraps
of
suet
and
drippings
of
wild
turkey
or
wild
geese
which
last
is
not
pleasant
to
use
in
food
and
not
fit
for
candles
well
when
we
have
saved
four
and
twenty
pounds
of
this
kind
of
grease
and
set
aside
six
bushels
of
ashes
from
what
is
known
as
hard
wood
such
as
oak
maple
or
birch
we
set
the
leach
i
suppose
every
family
in
boston
has
a
which
is
a
stout
cask
perhaps
one
that
has
held
pickled
pork
or
pickled
beef
and
has
in
it
at
the
very
bottom
a
hole
where
is
set
a
wooden
spigot
this
barrel
is
placed
upon
some
sort
of
platform
built
to
raise
it
sufficiently
high
from
the
ground
so
that
a
small
tub
or
bucket
may
be
put
under
the
spigot
then
it
is
filled
with
ashes
and
water
poured
into
the
top
which
of
course
trickles
down
until
it
runs
or
as
some
say
is
leached
out
through
the
spigot
into
the
bucket
or
whatsoever
you
have
put
there
to
receive
it
while
running
slowly
through
the
ashes
it
becomes
what
is
called
lye
and
upon
the
making
of
this
lye
depends
the
quality
of
the
soap
illustration
now
of
course
as
the
water
is
poured
upon
the
contents
of
the
barrel
the
ashes
settle
down
and
as
fast
as
this
comes
to
pass
yet
more
ashes
are
added
and
more
water
thrown
in
until
one
has
leached
the
entire
six
bushels
when
the
lye
should
be
strong
enough
as
mother
receipt
for
has
it
to
bear
up
an
egg
or
a
potato
so
that
you
can
see
a
portion
of
it
on
the
surface
as
big
as
a
ninepence
if
the
lye
is
not
of
sufficient
strength
to
stand
this
test
it
must
be
ladled
out
and
poured
over
the
ashes
again
until
finally
as
will
surely
be
the
case
it
has
become
strong
enough
the
next
turn
in
the
work
is
to
build
a
fire
out
of
doors
somewhere
because
to
make
your
soap
in
the
house
would
be
a
most
disagreeable
undertaking
one
needs
a
great
pot
which
should
hold
as
much
as
of
a
barrel
and
into
this
is
poured
half
of
the
grease
and
half
of
the
lye
to
be
kept
boiling
until
it
has
become
soap
now
just
when
that
point
has
been
reached
i
can
not
say
because
of
not
having
had
sufficient
experience
but
mother
is
a
master
hand
at
this
dirty
labor
and
always
has
greatest
success
with
it
of
course
when
one
has
been
boiled
down
the
remainder
of
the
lye
and
the
remainder
of
the
grease
is
put
in
and
worked
in
the
same
manner
as
before
soap
from
bayberries
it
is
possible
and
we
shall
do
so
when
time
can
be
spent
in
making
luxuries
to
get
soap
from
the
tallow
of
bay
berry
plums
i
have
already
said
that
we
stew
out
a
kind
of
vegetable
tallow
from
bayberries
with
which
to
make
candles
and
this
same
grease
when
boiled
with
lye
as
if
you
were
making
soft
soap
can
be
cooked
so
stiff
that
when
poured
into
molds
it
will
form
little
hard
cakes
that
are
particularly
convenient
for
the
cleansing
of
one
hands
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
bayberry
soap
will
whiten
and
soften
the
skin
better
than
does
soft
soap
but
the
labor
of
making
it
is
so
disagreeable
that
as
susan
says
i
had
rather
my
hands
were
tough
and
rough
than
purchase
a
delicate
skin
at
such
an
expense
there
is
another
household
duty
which
frets
me
much
and
yet
it
must
be
performed
else
would
we
be
put
to
it
for
quills
with
which
to
write
and
for
soft
beds
pillows
and
quilts
it
is
that
i
abhor
not
only
because
of
its
seeming
extremely
cruel
but
on
account
of
its
being
like
the
dirty
work
i
question
if
there
be
a
family
in
boston
who
does
not
own
a
flock
of
geese
and
among
them
many
who
were
once
wild
they
wander
around
the
streets
all
summer
paddling
the
pools
of
water
chasing
insects
and
devouring
whatsoever
may
have
been
thrown
out
of
the
houses
that
is
eatable
i
doubt
whether
if
it
were
within
the
power
of
our
preachers
so
to
do
they
would
not
kill
all
the
geese
in
the
town
for
more
than
once
on
a
sabbath
day
have
these
noisy
creatures
made
such
a
tumult
outside
the
church
that
the
sermon
was
actually
interrupted
besides
that
you
can
not
go
anywhere
without
a
lot
of
foolish
geese
running
at
your
heels
hissing
as
if
you
had
done
something
for
which
you
should
be
ashamed
and
they
were
calling
attention
to
it
twice
each
season
in
the
planting
and
the
harvesting
time
must
the
small
feathers
be
stripped
from
the
live
birds
and
while
this
is
being
done
the
goose
which
has
a
strong
neck
and
beak
would
inflict
many
a
grievous
wound
if
one
did
not
pull
an
old
stocking
over
its
head
some
people
are
so
particular
as
to
have
made
goose
baskets
which
in
shape
are
not
unlike
small
gourds
and
through
the
narrow
neck
of
these
the
head
of
the
goose
is
thrust
while
the
body
can
be
held
firmly
between
the
knees
of
whosoever
is
doing
the
plucking
illustration
of
course
when
one
is
pulling
feathers
from
the
bird
the
fine
fluff
or
down
flies
everywhere
about
like
snow
and
the
result
is
that
unless
you
take
the
precaution
of
tying
your
hair
up
in
cloths
and
putting
on
an
old
linen
dress
from
which
dirt
can
readily
be
shaken
you
will
be
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
these
fluffy
particles
which
are
not
much
larger
than
and
extremely
difficult
to
remove
i
have
been
so
busy
setting
down
matters
concerning
the
household
as
to
forget
that
i
should
tell
you
how
our
town
of
boston
has
grown
and
who
of
the
great
men
of
england
have
come
into
it
a
change
of
governors
it
was
the
third
year
after
our
coming
that
master
john
cotton
the
famous
preacher
settled
among
us
taking
upon
himself
because
of
the
entreaties
of
our
people
the
care
of
the
first
church
it
was
also
in
this
same
year
that
a
new
governor
was
chosen
much
to
the
regret
of
both
susan
and
me
for
while
we
girls
could
not
be
expected
to
know
anything
regarding
the
matter
it
surely
seemed
to
us
that
master
winthrop
was
the
very
best
man
in
all
this
world
to
rule
over
us
but
those
who
had
the
privilege
of
voting
must
have
believed
otherwise
for
they
elected
master
thomas
dudley
in
his
stead
and
made
master
winthrop
one
of
the
assistants
in
the
council
with
the
exception
of
that
and
the
trouble
which
master
roger
williams
the
great
preacher
was
making
nothing
disturbed
us
our
town
continued
to
grow
fast
until
we
began
to
believe
that
before
many
years
had
passed
it
would
be
even
as
great
a
city
as
could
be
found
in
england
with
of
course
the
exception
of
london
the
flight
of
roger
williams
now
as
to
the
trouble
which
some
of
our
people
were
having
with
master
roger
williams
i
should
be
able
to
set
it
down
plainly
and
yet
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
girls
know
much
about
the
affairs
of
state
a
very
great
preacher
was
master
williams
and
one
who
took
it
upon
himself
to
write
for
the
public
reading
that
the
king
had
no
right
to
sell
or
give
land
to
us
white
people
because
of
the
whole
country
belonging
to
the
indians
and
it
can
be
well
understood
how
much
of
a
stir
the
matter
caused
master
williams
had
been
chosen
by
the
people
of
salem
as
teacher
in
their
church
and
when
he
declared
that
we
had
no
right
to
hold
the
land
which
the
king
had
granted
us
which
master
blackstone
had
sold
to
us
and
which
chickatabut
had
given
to
us
in
writing
the
chief
men
of
our
town
declared
that
he
was
not
the
kind
of
preacher
who
should
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
new
world
therefore
they
wrote
to
the
people
of
salem
demanding
that
he
be
sent
back
to
england
of
course
our
gentlemen
of
boston
must
have
been
in
the
right
for
i
have
heard
my
father
say
they
were
and
surely
he
would
not
lend
his
face
to
anything
which
was
at
all
wrong
however
the
people
of
salem
refused
to
listen
to
us
of
boston
and
much
to
our
surprise
master
john
cotton
took
sides
with
master
williams
which
seemed
to
me
very
strange
i
can
not
say
why
it
was
that
the
people
of
the
colony
kept
governor
dudley
in
office
only
one
year
or
why
master
haynes
was
elected
master
haynes
was
of
course
ruler
over
the
entire
colony
and
as
father
said
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
trifled
with
by
master
williams
even
though
he
was
a
preacher
therefore
when
captain
underhill
was
about
to
sail
for
england
our
governor
commanded
him
to
take
master
williams
back
to
london
illustration
some
one
it
seems
told
the
preacher
what
was
on
foot
and
although
it
was
in
january
with
the
snow
piled
deep
everywhere
around
he
fled
from
salem
into
the
woods
trusting
himself
to
the
mercy
of
the
savages
rather
than
be
sent
back
in
disgrace
i
have
heard
that
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
day
with
the
snow
blowing
furiously
when
the
poor
man
plunged
into
the
woods
in
flight
taking
with
him
nothing
whatsoever
save
that
which
he
wore
upon
his
back
father
came
to
know
afterward
that
master
williams
spent
the
winter
with
the
pokanoket
indians
some
of
whom
he
had
met
during
the
short
time
he
lived
at
plymouth
and
in
the
spring
went
to
the
shore
of
narragansett
bay
where
it
was
reported
that
he
was
trying
to
build
up
a
village
sir
harry
vane
quite
the
most
distinguished
person
who
came
among
us
was
sir
harry
vane
his
father
was
a
privy
councilor
to
the
king
and
one
of
the
secretaries
of
state
in
england
because
of
wanting
to
see
the
new
world
the
young
gentleman
had
been
given
permission
to
come
to
this
country
for
a
term
of
three
years
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
stir
that
was
made
when
he
arrived
the
governor
with
his
soldiers
and
trumpeters
went
down
to
the
wharf
to
receive
him
with
great
ceremony
and
the
cannon
on
board
the
ships
were
discharged
with
a
wondrous
noise
when
he
stepped
ashore
he
was
a
most
pleasing
man
to
look
upon
so
young
and
so
courtly
while
his
costume
was
a
marvel
of
elegance
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
saw
him
taking
the
governor
hand
with
so
much
grace
that
we
needed
but
few
men
of
the
same
kind
among
us
to
lend
great
distinction
to
our
town
in
america
illustration
that
same
evening
however
my
mother
reproached
me
because
of
worldly
thoughts
saying
that
fine
feathers
do
not
make
fine
birds
although
they
may
make
a
bird
look
fine
which
i
suppose
is
the
same
as
if
she
had
said
that
an
evil
man
might
by
his
costume
be
made
to
appear
worthy
whereas
he
would
not
be
so
at
heart
however
i
was
not
the
only
one
in
boston
who
favored
sir
harry
vane
for
before
the
year
was
over
when
master
haynes
term
of
office
had
expired
he
was
chosen
as
our
governor
and
surely
no
person
could
have
looked
more
kingly
than
did
he
when
he
stood
in
the
door
of
the
great
house
bowing
to
those
people
who
had
assembled
in
honor
of
his
having
been
elected
making
sugar
susan
and
i
had
a
right
delightful
time
when
the
first
warm
days
of
spring
came
for
then
it
was
the
season
in
which
to
make
sugar
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
we
girls
took
any
part
in
the
sweet
work
but
on
a
certain
day
very
early
in
the
morning
we
were
allowed
to
go
out
to
master
winthrop
plantation
in
new
town
there
to
see
his
people
at
the
task
and
what
was
far
better
we
remained
until
late
at
night
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
away
from
home
save
to
go
over
to
charlestown
for
a
few
hours
since
we
came
from
england
and
i
enjoyed
it
all
the
more
because
of
its
being
something
strange
the
snow
was
deep
on
the
lands
therefore
we
wore
and
you
must
know
that
we
girls
can
use
those
odd
footings
almost
as
well
as
do
the
indian
children
it
was
a
long
walk
to
new
town
but
father
went
with
us
his
gun
loaded
heavily
in
case
we
came
across
a
hungry
wolf
and
so
great
was
the
excitement
of
going
abroad
after
having
been
kept
in
the
house
except
on
those
days
when
we
went
to
meeting
or
lecture
ever
since
the
winter
began
that
we
gave
no
heed
to
fatigue
illustration
it
seems
queer
that
one
can
get
sugar
from
trees
and
yet
so
we
do
in
this
new
country
otherwise
there
would
be
many
times
when
we
would
not
have
sweet
cake
for
vessels
seldom
arrive
from
england
with
stores
at
the
very
moment
when
one
is
in
need
of
this
thing
or
that
after
we
had
arrived
at
master
winthrop
plantation
good
mistress
winthrop
went
with
us
girls
to
see
the
sap
drawn
from
the
maples
and
the
three
of
us
rode
on
a
sled
hauled
by
one
of
the
serving
men
of
whom
master
winthrop
has
many
do
you
know
how
the
sap
is
taken
well
first
a
hole
is
bored
in
the
trunk
of
a
tree
about
as
high
from
the
surface
as
will
admit
of
placing
a
bucket
beneath
it
and
into
this
a
small
wooden
spout
or
spigot
is
driven
beneath
the
spout
is
placed
a
bucket
or
tub
and
into
this
the
sap
coaxed
up
from
the
roots
by
the
warmth
of
the
sun
drops
or
runs
very
slowly
illustration
master
winthrop
serving
men
made
holes
in
many
trees
and
then
when
the
work
had
been
done
went
about
gathering
the
sap
out
of
the
buckets
or
tubs
into
casks
which
were
hauled
from
place
to
place
on
a
sled
exactly
as
mistress
winthrop
susan
and
i
had
ridden
as
soon
as
a
cask
has
been
filled
a
huge
fire
is
built
near
at
hand
and
over
it
is
hung
a
large
kettle
much
as
if
one
were
counting
on
making
soap
in
this
the
sap
is
boiled
until
it
is
thick
like
molasses
in
case
one
wishes
to
make
syrup
or
yet
longer
if
sugar
is
wanted
of
course
it
is
necessary
to
taste
of
the
syrup
very
often
to
learn
if
it
has
been
cooked
enough
and
this
portion
of
the
work
susan
and
i
did
until
we
felt
much
as
flies
look
after
they
have
been
feasting
on
molasses
and
have
their
wings
and
legs
clogged
with
sweetness
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
we
besmeared
ourselves
with
it
but
we
ate
so
much
while
tasting
to
learn
if
the
cooking
was
going
on
properly
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
turned
into
a
big
cake
of
sugar
when
the
sap
is
thick
enough
to
sugar
as
it
is
called
it
is
poured
into
pans
of
where
it
cools
in
cakes
each
weighing
two
or
three
pounds
a
sugaring
dinner
we
enjoyed
ourselves
hugely
until
well
after
noon
when
we
were
so
weary
and
sticky
that
it
was
a
positive
relief
to
hear
mistress
winthrop
propose
that
we
go
back
to
her
dwelling
and
there
what
do
you
think
we
found
no
less
than
twenty
people
from
boston
among
whom
were
susan
mother
and
mine
had
all
come
out
for
what
is
called
the
sugaring
dinner
master
cotton
the
preacher
was
with
the
company
and
he
made
a
most
beautiful
prayer
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
meal
to
be
served
after
which
the
spirit
moved
him
to
ask
at
great
length
and
in
a
most
touching
manner
that
the
food
might
be
blessed
to
each
and
every
one
of
us
illustration
one
could
never
have
believed
that
we
who
were
gathered
around
the
table
ever
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
painfully
hungry
during
one
entire
winter
for
there
was
sufficient
of
food
to
have
served
us
in
the
old
days
a
full
week
there
were
two
enormous
wild
turkeys
roasted
to
a
most
delicious
crispness
one
placed
at
either
end
of
the
table
while
the
handsomest
standing
salt
i
ever
saw
was
exactly
in
the
center
so
that
no
one
could
say
whether
he
was
seated
above
or
below
the
salt
there
were
also
two
huge
venison
pies
with
the
pastry
made
wholly
of
wheat
flour
and
placed
around
the
pies
in
a
most
tasteful
manner
were
potted
pigeons
in
small
dishes
there
were
apple
and
pear
tarts
marmalade
and
preserved
plums
grapes
barberries
and
cherries
together
with
poppy
and
cherry
water
cordial
and
mint
water
it
was
a
most
delicate
feast
and
my
greatest
regret
was
that
i
had
tasted
so
often
of
the
maple
sap
i
could
not
do
full
justice
to
it
tears
actually
stood
in
susan
eyes
as
she
whispered
to
me
after
the
dinner
was
come
to
an
end
and
we
were
allowed
to
talk
with
each
other
i
shall
never
live
long
enough
to
cease
being
sorry
because
i
could
not
eat
more
it
was
the
same
as
if
she
had
confessed
to
the
sin
of
gluttony
and
it
was
my
duty
to
reprove
her
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
so
to
do
because
of
much
the
same
thought
being
in
my
own
mind
illustration
we
all
sang
psalms
until
near
to
seven
in
the
evening
when
good
master
winthrop
gave
us
a
famous
ride
on
his
new
sled
drawn
by
two
oxen
and
thus
did
we
go
home
like
really
fashionable
folk
who
must
needs
turn
night
into
day
as
my
mother
declared
training
day
i
must
tell
you
of
our
training
day
in
the
month
of
may
after
master
roger
williams
had
fled
into
the
wilderness
to
escape
the
wrath
of
our
people
which
he
had
aroused
and
i
am
setting
down
what
happened
on
that
particular
day
because
of
its
being
the
largest
and
most
exciting
training
ever
held
in
boston
so
every
one
says
susan
believes
training
day
should
come
oftener
than
four
times
a
year
so
that
we
young
people
may
get
some
idea
of
what
gay
life
is
like
in
the
old
countries
where
they
make
festivals
of
christmas
and
other
saints
days
it
does
truly
seem
as
if
we
might
see
our
soldiers
perform
quite
often
for
it
is
a
most
inspiring
spectacle
and
especially
was
it
on
last
training
day
when
so
father
says
there
were
upwards
of
seven
hundred
men
marching
back
and
forth
across
the
common
in
a
manner
which
at
times
was
really
terrifying
because
of
their
fierce
appearance
when
fully
armed
imagine
if
you
can
a
row
of
booths
along
the
common
in
which
are
for
sale
ground
nuts
packages
of
nookick
sweet
cakes
pumpkin
bread
roasted
brown
and
spread
with
syrup
made
from
maple
sap
together
with
dainties
of
all
kinds
lately
brought
over
from
england
between
these
booths
and
the
water
are
many
tents
which
have
been
set
up
that
the
people
of
quality
may
entertain
their
friends
therein
with
toothsome
food
and
sweet
waters
the
middle
of
the
common
and
a
long
space
at
either
end
is
kept
clear
of
idle
ones
that
the
soldiers
may
exercise
at
arms
and
these
do
not
appear
until
the
are
in
their
places
then
we
hear
a
flourish
of
trumpets
the
rolling
of
drums
and
from
the
direction
of
the
neck
comes
our
army
a
mighty
array
of
seven
hundred
or
more
men
all
armed
and
equipped
as
the
law
directs
when
this
vast
body
of
warlike
men
have
marched
into
the
vacant
space
they
are
drawn
up
in
line
there
is
another
flourish
of
trumpets
together
with
the
rolling
of
drums
and
master
cotton
comes
out
from
the
tent
which
has
been
set
up
for
the
use
of
the
governor
and
his
assistants
to
offer
a
prayer
on
this
day
moved
by
the
sight
of
the
great
throng
master
cotton
prayed
long
and
fervently
whereat
some
of
the
younger
soldiers
having
not
the
fear
of
god
in
their
hearts
pulled
long
faces
one
to
another
or
shifted
about
uneasily
on
their
feet
as
if
weary
with
long
standing
and
i
trembled
lest
the
governor
seeing
such
levity
might
rebuke
them
openly
which
would
be
a
great
disgrace
at
such
a
time
illustration
when
master
cotton
was
done
with
praying
the
soldiers
began
to
march
here
and
there
in
many
ways
until
one
eyes
were
confused
with
watching
them
and
then
came
the
volleys
as
the
men
shot
straight
over
the
heads
of
the
people
but
father
says
no
one
need
fear
such
warlike
work
for
there
were
no
bullets
in
the
guns
of
course
i
understood
that
he
must
needs
know
whether
this
be
true
or
not
else
he
would
not
have
spoken
it
and
yet
i
could
not
but
shudder
when
so
many
guns
were
fired
at
one
time
while
the
smoke
of
powder
in
the
air
was
most
painful
to
the
eyes
after
the
soldiers
had
marched
back
and
forth
in
the
most
ferocious
manner
possible
until
noon
they
were
allowed
a
time
for
rest
and
then
it
was
that
those
who
had
set
up
tents
entertained
their
friends
at
table
with
stores
upon
stores
of
dainties
of
every
kind
shooting
for
a
prize
i
have
heard
that
sir
harry
vane
declared
our
soldiers
presented
a
very
fine
front
whatever
that
may
be
and
he
is
not
backward
about
saying
that
even
the
king
himself
has
no
more
warlike
appearing
men
in
his
army
all
of
which
is
surely
true
for
sir
harry
being
the
son
of
a
privy
councilor
must
have
seen
his
majesty
troops
many
a
time
after
all
the
people
had
feasted
each
in
his
own
fashion
and
the
soldiers
had
been
refreshed
at
the
expense
of
the
town
the
marching
was
begun
again
to
be
continued
in
a
manner
like
to
make
one
head
swim
until
the
governor
gave
the
signal
that
the
shooting
at
a
target
might
commence
when
it
was
that
the
guns
were
loaded
with
real
bullets
on
this
day
it
was
sir
harry
who
gave
the
prize
to
be
shot
for
which
was
a
doublet
of
velvet
trimmed
with
lace
the
value
of
which
so
father
declares
is
not
less
than
five
times
as
great
as
any
prize
that
has
ever
been
offered
on
training
day
in
boston
susan
and
i
were
eager
to
know
who
won
it
but
before
the
matter
was
settled
my
mother
insisted
it
was
time
for
us
to
go
home
because
of
the
behavior
of
some
of
the
soldiers
being
none
of
the
best
after
they
have
done
with
the
training
illustration
however
we
saw
the
doublet
and
marked
well
the
pattern
of
the
lace
therefore
if
the
winner
wears
it
on
the
street
there
will
be
no
question
as
to
our
knowing
it
again
the
training
was
a
most
enjoyable
spectacle
even
though
susan
and
i
were
so
frightened
at
times
that
it
seemed
as
if
our
hearts
were
really
in
our
mouths
and
when
we
followed
mother
home
on
that
afternoon
it
was
with
the
belief
that
our
town
of
boston
although
not
as
old
as
jamestown
plymouth
or
salem
had
grown
both
in
numbers
and
fashion
far
beyond
any
other
settlement
in
this
new
world
lecture
day
my
mother
believes
it
would
be
better
if
training
day
were
done
away
with
entirely
for
she
says
we
spend
far
too
much
time
in
the
pursuit
of
frivolity
when
we
have
no
less
than
one
lecture
day
in
each
week
it
must
be
that
she
is
in
the
right
for
father
has
much
the
same
opinion
and
declares
a
stop
must
be
put
to
so
many
lectures
which
but
gives
a
convenient
excuse
for
indolent
people
who
should
be
at
work
on
the
plantations
or
in
the
houses
to
go
gadding
about
the
town
you
must
know
that
thursday
is
the
day
when
we
listen
to
lectures
by
some
of
the
preachers
or
those
among
the
magistrates
who
have
the
gift
of
speech
and
this
has
been
the
custom
since
the
first
year
we
came
here
in
the
early
days
the
lecture
hour
was
in
the
forenoon
but
at
the
end
of
three
years
after
boston
was
become
a
town
those
in
authority
over
us
passed
a
law
that
the
lecture
should
not
begin
until
one
of
the
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
this
was
done
in
order
that
the
people
might
not
have
an
excuse
to
spend
the
entire
day
in
idleness
i
can
not
see
however
that
any
more
work
is
done
on
thursdays
now
than
before
the
law
was
made
for
as
soon
as
breakfast
is
finished
and
the
houses
have
been
set
in
order
nearly
every
one
walks
on
the
streets
this
pleasure
being
forbidden
on
sabbath
days
until
it
is
time
to
gather
at
the
church
our
magistrates
also
tried
to
make
the
rule
that
no
minister
or
other
person
should
lecture
more
often
than
once
in
every
two
weeks
in
order
that
we
might
have
less
of
such
diversion
but
no
heed
is
given
to
this
law
for
i
myself
have
heard
master
cotton
speak
to
the
people
no
less
than
twice
on
every
thursday
and
this
in
addition
to
lectures
by
other
preachers
if
father
were
one
of
the
magistrates
mother
would
do
all
she
might
to
have
the
hour
of
the
meetings
set
back
to
the
morning
for
she
believes
it
is
wrong
to
make
of
the
forenoon
a
time
for
the
punishing
of
as
has
come
to
be
the
custom
punishment
for
now
when
we
go
out
to
mingle
with
the
people
it
is
impossible
not
to
stop
here
or
there
when
one
of
the
constables
is
whipping
an
idle
fellow
through
the
streets
laying
the
lashes
on
his
bare
back
with
such
force
that
the
blood
follows
nearly
every
blow
then
again
it
is
not
often
that
one
can
pass
the
post
at
the
corner
of
prison
lane
without
seeing
some
chained
there
as
punishment
for
striking
one
of
the
people
and
the
cage
wherein
are
kept
men
and
women
who
have
offended
against
the
laws
is
seldom
empty
on
a
thursday
illustration
the
prison
itself
is
a
dreary
looking
place
although
it
is
not
quite
so
very
different
from
the
church
but
somehow
its
barred
windows
make
the
shivers
run
up
and
down
my
back
and
i
always
hurry
past
it
with
as
much
speed
as
possible
most
likely
there
are
as
many
bad
people
in
the
other
towns
of
this
new
world
as
in
boston
but
it
surely
seems
to
susan
and
me
as
if
we
had
among
us
all
those
in
america
who
delight
in
breaking
the
laws
of
all
the
punishments
which
are
inflicted
here
i
think
the
most
cruel
is
that
of
sentencing
a
man
to
wear
so
long
as
he
may
live
a
halter
around
his
neck
so
that
every
one
may
see
it
for
thus
is
the
forced
to
shame
himself
during
every
hour
of
the
day
and
especially
on
thursdays
when
he
must
stand
not
less
than
two
hours
during
the
forenoon
on
the
steps
of
the
church
it
is
on
lecture
day
that
one
may
see
the
latest
notices
put
up
on
the
church
together
with
the
announcements
of
those
who
intend
to
be
married
and
susan
and
i
have
great
pleasure
in
reading
these
for
then
are
we
aware
of
anything
important
about
to
take
place
of
course
there
are
times
when
we
are
not
so
well
pleased
at
being
forced
to
sit
still
five
or
six
long
hours
listening
to
this
preacher
or
that
who
feels
a
call
to
speak
during
the
lecture
time
but
if
we
failed
to
do
so
we
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
the
street
wheresoever
we
please
therefore
i
hope
that
mother
will
not
be
able
to
have
the
lecture
hour
changed
to
the
morning
the
murder
of
john
oldham
illustration
it
was
six
years
after
we
had
come
to
live
in
boston
that
a
most
terrible
crime
was
committed
by
the
savages
of
the
narragansett
tribe
for
then
they
killed
captain
john
oldham
and
three
other
men
who
were
sailing
on
long
island
sound
the
vessel
was
taken
by
the
indians
after
they
had
murdered
all
on
board
and
we
in
boston
were
moved
to
great
fear
believing
the
brown
men
around
us
were
making
ready
to
murder
the
white
people
sir
harry
vane
the
governor
sent
five
of
our
chief
men
to
the
head
savage
of
the
narragansett
tribe
to
inquire
into
the
matter
and
these
messengers
were
told
that
none
save
the
indians
living
on
block
island
had
any
hand
in
the
matter
then
it
was
that
governor
vane
commanded
master
endicott
of
salem
to
take
a
large
number
of
fighting
men
in
three
vessels
and
punish
the
murderers
as
they
deserved
master
endicott
did
according
to
the
command
but
when
he
was
come
to
block
island
the
brown
people
had
run
away
therefore
all
he
could
do
was
to
burn
the
huts
destroy
the
canoes
and
shoot
the
dogs
that
were
prowling
around
the
deserted
village
this
master
endicott
did
not
believe
was
punishment
enough
for
what
had
been
done
therefore
he
crossed
over
to
the
mainland
where
the
indians
who
call
themselves
pequots
live
and
there
he
killed
more
than
twenty
of
these
people
besides
seizing
their
corn
he
also
burned
or
destroyed
in
some
other
way
all
the
goods
belonging
to
the
savages
that
he
could
find
and
then
came
back
to
boston
where
the
people
of
the
town
turned
out
to
give
him
a
noble
welcome
we
had
a
thanksgiving
day
because
of
what
had
been
done
and
believed
or
at
least
susan
and
i
did
that
we
need
fear
nothing
more
from
the
savages
for
surely
the
brown
people
would
not
dare
molest
any
white
man
again
after
being
so
severely
punished
savages
on
the
it
was
not
many
days
however
before
word
was
brought
to
boston
that
the
pequot
indians
were
trying
to
coax
the
narragansett
savages
to
join
them
in
killing
every
englishman
that
could
be
found
in
the
land
father
had
said
that
this
might
be
done
if
the
brown
people
all
over
the
country
should
come
together
and
we
who
lived
in
boston
and
salem
were
in
great
fear
the
soldiers
were
called
together
from
every
village
the
gates
of
the
fort
on
the
neck
were
kept
closed
with
men
stationed
there
night
and
day
to
see
that
no
enemy
came
through
and
the
preachers
prayed
most
fervently
that
our
lives
might
be
spared
because
of
our
doing
our
utmost
to
serve
god
as
he
would
have
us
then
it
was
that
the
lord
heard
our
prayers
else
had
we
all
been
killed
and
it
was
brought
about
in
a
way
such
as
my
mother
said
heaped
coals
of
fire
upon
our
heads
the
same
master
roger
williams
who
had
been
driven
out
into
the
wilderness
because
of
holding
a
belief
contrary
to
ours
and
who
had
lived
with
the
narragansett
indians
since
then
so
pleaded
with
the
savages
of
the
tribe
that
they
sent
some
of
their
chief
people
to
boston
with
promises
of
friendliness
sir
harry
vane
received
the
visitors
with
great
state
all
our
soldiers
were
paraded
through
the
streets
and
in
front
of
the
governor
house
the
drummers
marched
to
and
fro
making
music
and
the
people
came
out
on
the
streets
that
the
indians
might
believe
we
had
not
been
afraid
illustration
it
was
much
like
training
day
save
that
only
the
magistrates
of
the
town
were
allowed
to
know
what
was
being
done
in
the
governor
house
after
the
savages
had
gone
into
the
building
decked
out
in
a
brave
array
of
feathers
and
in
clothing
embroidered
with
fanciful
colored
quills
of
porcupines
and
with
their
faces
painted
in
a
most
hideous
fashion
we
were
told
after
the
indians
had
marched
out
of
the
town
near
to
sunset
one
behind
the
other
in
a
manner
as
solemn
as
if
they
were
coming
from
church
that
the
tribe
of
narragansett
savages
had
promised
to
aid
us
white
people
against
the
brown
men
of
the
pequot
tribe
in
every
way
possible
and
greatly
did
we
rejoice
that
night
for
it
seemed
as
if
all
trouble
had
passed
pequot
indians
the
englishmen
who
had
settled
in
the
colony
known
as
connecticut
soon
found
that
the
pequot
savages
could
do
much
of
wickedness
even
though
the
narragansetts
had
said
they
would
be
friends
with
the
white
people
for
within
a
very
short
time
after
master
roger
williams
had
sent
the
indians
to
us
in
peace
did
a
season
of
murder
begin
because
of
my
being
a
girl
who
is
not
supposed
to
understand
affairs
of
state
and
who
could
only
cower
in
fear
and
trembling
by
the
side
of
her
mother
when
word
was
brought
of
the
dreadful
deeds
done
by
the
pequot
savages
i
shall
not
set
down
anything
whatsoever
concerning
that
terrible
winter
when
we
heard
nothing
save
stories
of
blood
and
direst
suffering
no
one
could
say
whether
despite
all
master
roger
williams
might
be
able
to
do
the
savages
nearabout
would
not
fall
upon
us
of
boston
as
they
had
upon
the
white
people
of
connecticut
and
therefore
as
soon
as
the
shadows
of
evening
had
begun
to
gather
we
girls
sought
the
protection
of
our
mothers
illustration
seated
before
the
roaring
fires
not
daring
to
move
about
the
house
even
after
the
doors
and
shutters
were
securely
barred
we
started
in
alarm
at
every
sound
hearing
in
the
roaring
of
the
wind
or
the
crackling
of
the
fire
some
token
that
the
brown
people
were
skulking
around
striving
to
get
inside
that
they
might
shed
our
blood
it
was
far
worse
than
the
time
of
the
famine
for
then
we
knew
just
what
might
come
to
us
and
if
death
entered
the
house
we
would
meet
it
in
the
arms
of
those
we
loved
but
from
all
which
had
been
told
by
those
affrighted
people
who
came
to
us
from
connecticut
we
realized
that
horrors
such
as
could
not
even
be
imagined
would
be
upon
us
with
the
coming
of
those
savages
who
had
sworn
to
make
an
end
of
the
white
settlers
in
the
new
world
it
is
not
well
even
that
i
set
down
in
words
the
distress
of
mind
which
was
ours
during
that
long
dreadful
winter
but
this
i
may
say
in
all
truth
as
the
parting
word
that
nowhere
in
the
massachusetts
bay
colony
could
have
been
found
a
more
distressed
or
unhappy
girl
than
this
same
ruth
of
boston
