euthydemus
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
the
euthydemus
though
apt
to
be
regarded
by
us
only
as
an
elaborate
jest
has
also
a
very
serious
purpose
it
may
fairly
claim
to
be
the
oldest
treatise
on
logic
for
that
science
originates
in
the
misunderstandings
which
necessarily
accompany
the
first
efforts
of
speculation
several
of
the
fallacies
which
are
satirized
in
it
reappear
in
the
sophistici
elenchi
of
aristotle
and
are
retained
at
the
end
of
our
manuals
of
logic
but
if
the
order
of
history
were
followed
they
should
be
placed
not
at
the
end
but
at
the
beginning
of
them
for
they
belong
to
the
age
in
which
the
human
mind
was
first
making
the
attempt
to
distinguish
thought
from
sense
and
to
separate
the
universal
from
the
particular
or
individual
how
to
put
together
words
or
ideas
how
to
escape
ambiguities
in
the
meaning
of
terms
or
in
the
structure
of
propositions
how
to
resist
the
fixed
impression
of
an
or
flux
how
to
distinguish
between
words
and
things
these
were
problems
not
easy
of
solution
in
the
infancy
of
philosophy
they
presented
the
same
kind
of
difficulty
to
the
man
which
spelling
or
arithmetic
do
to
the
mind
of
a
child
it
was
long
before
the
new
world
of
ideas
which
had
been
sought
after
with
such
passionate
yearning
was
set
in
order
and
made
ready
for
use
to
us
the
fallacies
which
arise
in
the
philosophy
are
trivial
and
obsolete
because
we
are
no
longer
liable
to
fall
into
the
errors
which
are
expressed
by
them
the
intellectual
world
has
become
better
assured
to
us
and
we
are
less
likely
to
be
imposed
upon
by
illusions
of
words
the
logic
of
aristotle
is
for
the
most
part
latent
in
the
dialogues
of
plato
the
nature
of
definition
is
explained
not
by
rules
but
by
examples
in
the
charmides
lysis
laches
protagoras
meno
euthyphro
theaetetus
gorgias
republic
the
nature
of
division
is
likewise
illustrated
by
examples
in
the
sophist
and
statesman
a
scheme
of
categories
is
found
in
the
philebus
the
true
doctrine
of
contradiction
is
taught
and
the
fallacy
of
arguing
in
a
circle
is
exposed
in
the
republic
the
nature
of
synthesis
and
analysis
is
graphically
described
in
the
phaedrus
the
nature
of
words
is
analysed
in
the
cratylus
the
form
of
the
syllogism
is
indicated
in
the
genealogical
trees
of
the
sophist
and
statesman
a
true
doctrine
of
predication
and
an
analysis
of
the
sentence
are
given
in
the
sophist
the
different
meanings
of
one
and
being
are
worked
out
in
the
parmenides
here
we
have
most
of
the
important
elements
of
logic
not
yet
systematized
or
reduced
to
an
art
or
science
but
scattered
up
and
down
as
they
would
naturally
occur
in
ordinary
discourse
they
are
of
little
or
no
use
or
significance
to
us
but
because
we
have
grown
out
of
the
need
of
them
we
should
not
therefore
despise
them
they
are
still
interesting
and
instructive
for
the
light
which
they
shed
on
the
history
of
the
human
mind
there
are
indeed
many
old
fallacies
which
linger
among
us
and
new
ones
are
constantly
springing
up
but
they
are
not
of
the
kind
to
which
ancient
logic
can
be
usefully
applied
the
weapons
of
common
sense
not
the
analytics
of
aristotle
are
needed
for
their
overthrow
nor
is
the
use
of
the
aristotelian
logic
any
longer
natural
to
us
we
no
longer
put
arguments
into
the
form
of
syllogisms
like
the
schoolmen
the
simple
use
of
language
has
been
happily
restored
to
us
neither
do
we
discuss
the
nature
of
the
proposition
nor
extract
hidden
truths
from
the
copula
nor
dispute
any
longer
about
nominalism
and
realism
we
do
not
confuse
the
form
with
the
matter
of
knowledge
or
invent
laws
of
thought
or
imagine
that
any
single
science
furnishes
a
principle
of
reasoning
to
all
the
rest
neither
do
we
require
categories
or
heads
of
argument
to
be
invented
for
our
use
those
who
have
no
knowledge
of
logic
like
some
of
our
great
physical
philosophers
seem
to
be
quite
as
good
reasoners
as
those
who
have
most
of
the
ancient
puzzles
have
been
settled
on
the
basis
of
usage
and
common
sense
there
is
no
need
to
reopen
them
no
science
should
raise
problems
or
invent
forms
of
thought
which
add
nothing
to
knowledge
and
are
of
no
use
in
assisting
the
acquisition
of
it
this
seems
to
be
the
natural
limit
of
logic
and
metaphysics
if
they
give
us
a
more
comprehensive
or
a
more
definite
view
of
the
different
spheres
of
knowledge
they
are
to
be
studied
if
not
not
the
better
part
of
ancient
logic
appears
hardly
in
our
own
day
to
have
a
separate
existence
it
is
absorbed
in
two
other
sciences
rhetoric
if
indeed
this
ancient
art
be
not
also
fading
away
into
literary
criticism
the
science
of
language
under
which
all
questions
relating
to
words
and
propositions
and
the
combinations
of
them
may
properly
be
included
to
continue
dead
or
imaginary
sciences
which
make
no
signs
of
progress
and
have
no
definite
sphere
tends
to
interfere
with
the
prosecution
of
living
ones
the
study
of
them
is
apt
to
blind
the
judgment
and
to
render
men
incapable
of
seeing
the
value
of
evidence
and
even
of
appreciating
the
nature
of
truth
nor
should
we
allow
the
living
science
to
become
confused
with
the
dead
by
an
ambiguity
of
language
the
term
logic
has
two
different
meanings
an
ancient
and
a
modern
one
and
we
vainly
try
to
bridge
the
gulf
between
them
many
perplexities
are
avoided
by
keeping
them
apart
there
might
certainly
be
a
new
science
of
logic
it
would
not
however
be
built
up
out
of
the
fragments
of
the
old
but
would
be
distinct
from
them
relative
to
the
state
of
knowledge
which
exists
at
the
present
time
and
based
chiefly
on
the
methods
of
modern
inductive
philosophy
such
a
science
might
have
two
legitimate
fields
first
the
refutation
and
explanation
of
false
philosophies
still
hovering
in
the
air
as
they
appear
from
the
point
of
view
of
later
experience
or
are
comprehended
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
as
in
a
larger
horizon
secondly
it
might
furnish
new
forms
of
thought
more
adequate
to
the
expression
of
all
the
diversities
and
oppositions
of
knowledge
which
have
grown
up
in
these
latter
days
it
might
also
suggest
new
methods
of
enquiry
derived
from
the
comparison
of
the
sciences
few
will
deny
that
the
introduction
of
the
words
and
and
the
hegelian
reconciliation
of
opposites
have
been
gracious
aids
to
psychology
or
that
the
methods
of
bacon
and
mill
have
shed
a
light
far
and
wide
on
the
realms
of
knowledge
these
two
great
studies
the
one
destructive
and
corrective
of
error
the
other
conservative
and
constructive
of
truth
might
be
a
first
and
second
part
of
logic
ancient
logic
would
be
the
propaedeutic
or
gate
of
approach
to
logical
science
nothing
more
but
to
pursue
such
speculations
further
though
not
irrelevant
might
lead
us
too
far
away
from
the
argument
of
the
dialogue
the
euthydemus
is
of
all
the
dialogues
of
plato
that
in
which
he
approaches
most
nearly
to
the
comic
poet
the
mirth
is
broader
the
irony
more
sustained
the
contrast
between
socrates
and
the
two
sophists
although
veiled
penetrates
deeper
than
in
any
other
of
his
writings
even
thrasymachus
in
the
republic
is
at
last
pacified
and
becomes
a
friendly
and
interested
auditor
of
the
great
discourse
but
in
the
euthydemus
the
mask
is
never
dropped
the
accustomed
irony
of
socrates
continues
to
the
end
socrates
narrates
to
crito
a
remarkable
scene
in
which
he
has
himself
taken
part
and
in
which
the
two
brothers
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
are
the
chief
performers
they
are
natives
of
chios
who
had
settled
at
thurii
but
were
driven
out
and
in
former
days
had
been
known
at
athens
as
professors
of
rhetoric
and
of
the
art
of
fighting
in
armour
to
this
they
have
now
added
a
new
accomplishment
the
art
of
eristic
or
fighting
with
words
which
they
are
likewise
willing
to
teach
a
consideration
but
they
can
also
teach
virtue
in
a
very
short
time
and
in
the
very
best
manner
socrates
who
is
always
on
the
for
teachers
of
virtue
is
interested
in
the
youth
cleinias
the
grandson
of
the
great
alcibiades
and
is
desirous
that
he
should
have
the
benefit
of
their
instructions
he
is
ready
to
fall
down
and
worship
them
although
the
greatness
of
their
professions
does
arouse
in
his
mind
a
temporary
incredulity
a
circle
gathers
round
them
in
the
midst
of
which
are
socrates
the
two
brothers
the
youth
cleinias
who
is
watched
by
the
eager
eyes
of
his
lover
ctesippus
and
others
the
performance
begins
and
such
a
performance
as
might
well
seem
to
require
an
invocation
of
memory
and
the
muses
it
is
agreed
that
the
brothers
shall
question
cleinias
says
euthydemus
learn
the
wise
or
the
unwise
wise
is
the
reply
given
with
blushing
and
hesitation
yet
when
you
learned
you
did
not
know
and
were
not
wise
then
dionysodorus
takes
up
the
ball
are
they
who
learn
dictation
of
the
the
wise
or
the
foolish
boys
wise
after
all
the
wise
learn
do
they
learn
said
euthydemus
they
know
or
what
they
do
not
know
latter
dictation
is
a
dictation
of
letters
you
know
letters
you
learn
what
you
know
retorts
dionysodorus
not
learning
acquiring
knowledge
you
acquire
that
which
you
have
not
got
already
you
learn
that
which
you
do
not
know
socrates
is
afraid
that
the
youth
cleinias
may
be
discouraged
at
these
repeated
overthrows
he
therefore
explains
to
him
the
nature
of
the
process
to
which
he
is
being
subjected
the
two
strangers
are
not
serious
there
are
jests
at
the
mysteries
which
precede
the
enthronement
and
he
is
being
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
sophistical
ritual
this
is
all
a
sort
of
which
is
now
ended
the
exhortation
to
virtue
will
follow
and
socrates
himself
if
the
wise
men
will
not
laugh
at
him
is
desirous
of
showing
the
way
in
which
such
an
exhortation
should
be
carried
on
according
to
his
own
poor
notion
he
proceeds
to
question
cleinias
the
result
of
the
investigation
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
all
men
desire
good
and
good
means
the
possession
of
goods
such
as
wealth
health
beauty
birth
power
honour
not
forgetting
the
virtues
and
wisdom
and
yet
in
this
enumeration
the
greatest
good
of
all
is
omitted
what
is
that
good
fortune
but
what
need
is
there
of
good
fortune
when
we
have
wisdom
already
in
every
art
and
business
are
not
the
wise
also
the
fortunate
this
is
admitted
and
again
the
possession
of
goods
is
not
enough
there
must
also
be
a
right
use
of
them
which
can
only
be
given
by
knowledge
in
themselves
they
are
neither
good
nor
evil
knowledge
and
wisdom
are
the
only
good
and
ignorance
and
folly
the
only
evil
the
conclusion
is
that
we
must
get
but
can
wisdom
be
taught
says
cleinias
the
ingenuousness
of
the
youth
delights
socrates
who
is
at
once
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
discussing
one
of
his
great
puzzles
wisdom
is
the
only
good
he
must
become
a
philosopher
or
lover
of
wisdom
i
will
says
cleinias
after
socrates
has
given
this
specimen
of
his
own
mode
of
instruction
the
two
brothers
recommence
their
exhortation
to
virtue
which
is
of
quite
another
sort
want
cleinias
to
be
wise
he
is
not
wise
yet
you
want
him
to
be
what
he
is
not
and
not
to
be
what
he
is
not
to
be
that
is
to
perish
pretty
lovers
and
friends
you
must
all
be
here
ctesippus
the
lover
of
cleinias
interposes
in
great
excitement
thinking
that
he
will
teach
the
two
sophists
a
lesson
of
good
manners
but
he
is
quickly
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
their
sophistry
and
as
a
storm
seems
to
be
gathering
socrates
pacifies
him
with
a
joke
and
ctesippus
then
says
that
he
is
not
reviling
the
two
sophists
he
is
only
contradicting
them
says
dionysodorus
is
no
such
thing
as
contradiction
when
you
and
i
describe
the
same
thing
or
you
describe
one
thing
and
i
describe
another
how
can
there
be
a
contradiction
ctesippus
is
unable
to
reply
socrates
has
already
heard
of
the
denial
of
contradiction
and
would
like
to
be
informed
by
the
great
master
of
the
art
is
the
meaning
of
this
paradox
is
there
no
such
thing
as
error
ignorance
falsehood
then
what
are
they
professing
to
teach
the
two
sophists
complain
that
socrates
is
ready
to
answer
what
they
said
a
year
ago
but
is
at
what
they
are
saying
now
does
the
word
mean
socrates
is
informed
in
reply
that
words
are
lifeless
things
and
lifeless
things
have
no
sense
or
meaning
ctesippus
again
breaks
out
and
again
has
to
be
pacified
by
socrates
who
renews
the
conversation
with
cleinias
the
two
sophists
are
like
proteus
in
the
variety
of
their
transformations
and
he
like
menelaus
in
the
odyssey
hopes
to
restore
them
to
their
natural
form
he
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
cleinias
must
become
a
philosopher
and
philosophy
is
the
possession
of
knowledge
and
knowledge
must
be
of
a
kind
which
is
profitable
and
may
be
used
what
knowledge
is
there
which
has
such
a
nature
not
the
knowledge
which
is
required
in
any
particular
art
nor
again
the
art
of
the
composer
of
speeches
who
knows
how
to
write
them
but
can
not
speak
them
although
he
too
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
kind
of
enchanter
of
wild
animals
neither
is
the
knowledge
which
we
are
seeking
the
knowledge
of
the
general
for
the
general
makes
over
his
prey
to
the
statesman
as
the
huntsman
does
to
the
cook
or
the
taker
of
quails
to
the
keeper
of
quails
he
has
not
the
use
of
that
which
he
acquires
the
two
enquirers
cleinias
and
socrates
are
described
as
wandering
about
in
a
wilderness
vainly
searching
after
the
art
of
life
and
happiness
at
last
they
fix
upon
the
kingly
art
as
having
the
desired
sort
of
knowledge
but
the
kingly
art
only
gives
men
those
goods
which
are
neither
good
nor
evil
and
if
we
say
further
that
it
makes
us
wise
in
what
does
it
make
us
wise
not
in
special
arts
such
as
cobbling
or
carpentering
but
only
in
itself
or
say
again
that
it
makes
us
good
there
is
no
answer
to
the
question
in
what
at
length
in
despair
cleinias
and
socrates
turn
to
the
and
request
their
aid
euthydemus
argues
that
socrates
knows
something
and
as
he
can
not
know
and
not
know
he
can
not
know
some
things
and
not
know
others
and
therefore
he
knows
all
things
he
and
dionysodorus
and
all
other
men
know
all
things
they
know
shoemaking
etc
the
sceptical
ctesippus
would
like
to
have
some
evidence
of
this
extraordinary
statement
he
will
believe
if
euthydemus
will
tell
him
how
many
teeth
dionysodorus
has
and
if
dionysodorus
will
give
him
a
like
piece
of
information
about
euthydemus
even
socrates
is
incredulous
and
indulges
in
a
little
raillery
at
the
expense
of
the
brothers
but
he
restrains
himself
remembering
that
if
the
men
who
are
to
be
his
teachers
think
him
stupid
they
will
take
no
pains
with
him
another
fallacy
is
produced
which
turns
on
the
absoluteness
of
the
verb
know
and
here
dionysodorus
is
caught
and
is
induced
by
socrates
to
confess
that
does
not
know
the
good
to
be
unjust
socrates
appeals
to
his
brother
euthydemus
at
the
same
time
he
acknowledges
that
he
can
not
like
heracles
fight
against
a
hydra
and
even
heracles
on
the
approach
of
a
second
monster
called
upon
his
nephew
iolaus
to
help
dionysodorus
rejoins
that
iolaus
was
no
more
the
nephew
of
heracles
than
of
socrates
for
a
nephew
is
a
nephew
and
a
brother
is
a
brother
and
a
father
is
a
father
not
of
one
man
only
but
of
all
nor
of
men
only
but
of
dogs
and
ctesippus
makes
merry
with
the
consequences
which
follow
good
has
your
father
got
out
of
the
wisdom
of
his
puppies
says
euthydemus
unabashed
wants
much
good
medicine
is
a
good
arms
are
a
good
money
is
a
good
and
yet
there
may
be
too
much
of
them
in
wrong
places
says
ctesippus
can
not
be
too
much
gold
and
would
you
be
happy
if
you
had
three
talents
of
gold
in
your
belly
a
talent
in
your
pate
and
a
stater
in
either
eye
ctesippus
imitating
the
new
wisdom
replies
do
not
the
scythians
reckon
those
to
be
the
happiest
of
men
who
have
their
skulls
gilded
and
see
the
inside
of
them
you

retorts
euthydemus
has
the
quality
of

or
what
has
not
the
quality
of
vision
has
the
quality
of
vision
you
see
our
garments
our
garments
have
the
quality
of
vision
a
similar
play
of
words
follows
which
is
successfully
retorted
by
ctesippus
to
the
great
delight
of
cleinias
who
is
rebuked
by
socrates
for
laughing
at
such
solemn
and
beautiful
things
are
there
any
beautiful
things
and
if
there
are
such
are
they
the
same
or
not
the
same
as
absolute
beauty
socrates
replies
that
they
are
not
the
same
but
each
of
them
has
some
beauty
present
with
it
are
you
an
ox
because
you
have
an
ox
present
with
you
after
a
few
more
amphiboliae
in
which
socrates
like
ctesippus
in
borrows
the
weapons
of
the
brothers
they
both
confess
that
the
two
heroes
are
invincible
and
the
scene
concludes
with
a
grand
chorus
of
shouting
and
laughing
and
a
panegyrical
oration
from
socrates
first
he
praises
the
indifference
of
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
to
public
opinion
for
most
persons
would
rather
be
refuted
by
such
arguments
than
use
them
in
the
refutation
of
others
secondly
he
remarks
upon
their
impartiality
for
they
stop
their
own
mouths
as
well
as
those
of
other
people
thirdly
he
notes
their
liberality
which
makes
them
give
away
their
secret
to
all
the
world
they
should
be
more
reserved
and
let
no
one
be
present
at
this
exhibition
who
does
not
pay
them
a
handsome
fee
or
better
still
they
might
practise
on
one
another
only
he
concludes
with
a
respectful
request
that
they
will
receive
him
and
cleinias
among
their
disciples
crito
tells
socrates
that
he
has
heard
one
of
the
audience
criticise
severely
this
wisdom
not
sparing
socrates
himself
for
countenancing
such
an
exhibition
socrates
asks
what
manner
of
man
was
this
censorious
critic
an
orator
but
a
great
composer
of
speeches
socrates
understands
that
he
is
an
amphibious
animal
half
philosopher
half
politician
one
of
a
class
who
have
the
highest
opinion
of
themselves
and
a
spite
against
philosophers
whom
they
imagine
to
be
their
rivals
they
are
a
class
who
are
very
likely
to
get
mauled
by
euthydemus
and
his
friends
and
have
a
great
notion
of
their
own
wisdom
for
they
imagine
themselves
to
have
all
the
advantages
and
none
of
the
drawbacks
both
of
politics
and
of
philosophy
they
do
not
understand
the
principles
of
combination
and
hence
are
ignorant
that
the
union
of
two
good
things
which
have
different
ends
produces
a
compound
inferior
to
either
of
them
taken
separately
crito
is
anxious
about
the
education
of
his
children
one
of
whom
is
growing
up
the
description
of
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
suggests
to
him
the
reflection
that
the
professors
of
education
are
strange
beings
socrates
consoles
him
with
the
remark
that
the
good
in
all
professions
are
few
and
recommends
that
and
his
house
should
continue
to
serve
philosophy
and
not
mind
about
its
professors
there
is
a
stage
in
the
history
of
philosophy
in
which
the
old
is
dying
out
and
the
new
has
not
yet
come
into
full
life
great
philosophies
like
the
eleatic
or
heraclitean
which
have
enlarged
the
boundaries
of
the
human
mind
begin
to
pass
away
in
words
they
subsist
only
as
forms
which
have
rooted
themselves
in
language
as
troublesome
elements
of
thought
which
can
not
be
either
used
or
explained
away
the
same
absoluteness
which
was
once
attributed
to
abstractions
is
now
attached
to
the
words
which
are
the
signs
of
them
the
philosophy
which
in
the
first
and
second
generation
was
a
great
and
inspiring
effort
of
reflection
in
the
third
becomes
sophistical
verbal
eristic
it
is
this
stage
of
philosophy
which
plato
satirises
in
the
euthydemus
the
fallacies
which
are
noted
by
him
appear
trifling
to
us
now
but
they
were
not
trifling
in
the
age
before
logic
in
the
decline
of
the
earlier
greek
philosophies
at
a
time
when
language
was
first
beginning
to
perplex
human
thought
besides
he
is
caricaturing
them
they
probably
received
more
subtle
forms
at
the
hands
of
those
who
seriously
maintained
them
they
are
patent
to
us
in
plato
and
we
are
inclined
to
wonder
how
any
one
could
ever
have
been
deceived
by
them
but
we
must
remember
also
that
there
was
a
time
when
the
human
mind
was
only
with
great
difficulty
disentangled
from
such
fallacies
to
appreciate
fully
the
drift
of
the
euthydemus
we
should
imagine
a
mental
state
in
which
not
individuals
only
but
whole
schools
during
more
than
one
generation
were
animated
by
the
desire
to
exclude
the
conception
of
rest
and
therefore
the
very
word
theaet
from
language
in
which
the
ideas
of
space
time
matter
motion
were
proved
to
be
contradictory
and
imaginary
in
which
the
nature
of
qualitative
change
was
a
puzzle
and
even
differences
of
degree
when
applied
to
abstract
notions
were
not
understood
in
which
there
was
no
analysis
of
grammar
and
mere
puns
or
plays
of
words
received
serious
attention
in
which
contradiction
itself
was
denied
and
on
the
one
hand
every
predicate
was
affirmed
to
be
true
of
every
subject
and
on
the
other
it
was
held
that
no
predicate
was
true
of
any
subject
and
that
nothing
was
or
was
known
or
could
be
spoken
let
us
imagine
disputes
carried
on
with
religious
earnestness
and
more
than
scholastic
subtlety
in
which
the
catchwords
of
philosophy
are
completely
detached
from
their
context
compare
theaet
to
such
disputes
the
humour
whether
of
plato
in
the
ancient
or
of
pope
and
swift
in
the
modern
world
is
the
natural
enemy
nor
must
we
forget
that
in
modern
times
also
there
is
no
fallacy
so
gross
no
trick
of
language
so
transparent
no
abstraction
so
barren
and
unmeaning
no
form
of
thought
so
contradictory
to
experience
which
has
not
been
found
to
satisfy
the
minds
of
philosophical
enquirers
at
a
certain
stage
or
when
regarded
from
a
certain
point
of
view
only
the
peculiarity
of
the
fallacies
of
our
own
age
is
that
we
live
within
them
and
are
therefore
generally
unconscious
of
them
aristotle
has
analysed
several
of
the
same
fallacies
in
his
book
sophisticis
elenchis
which
plato
with
equal
command
of
their
true
nature
has
preferred
to
bring
to
the
test
of
ridicule
at
first
we
are
only
struck
with
the
broad
humour
of
this
ad
absurdum
gradually
we
perceive
that
some
important
questions
begin
to
emerge
here
as
everywhere
else
plato
is
making
war
against
the
philosophers
who
put
words
in
the
place
of
things
who
tear
arguments
to
tatters
who
deny
predication
and
thus
make
knowledge
impossible
to
whom
ideas
and
objects
of
sense
have
no
fixedness
but
are
in
a
state
of
perpetual
oscillation
and
transition
two
great
truths
seem
to
be
indirectly
taught
through
these
fallacies
the
uncertainty
of
language
which
allows
the
same
words
to
be
used
in
different
meanings
or
with
different
degrees
of
meaning
the
necessary
limitation
or
relative
nature
of
all
phenomena
plato
is
aware
that
his
own
doctrine
of
ideas
as
well
as
the
eleatic
being
and
alike
admit
of
being
regarded
as
verbal
fallacies
the
sophism
advanced
in
the
meno
you
can
not
enquire
either
into
what
you
know
or
do
not
know
is
lightly
touched
upon
at
the
commencement
of
the
dialogue
the
thesis
of
protagoras
that
everything
is
true
to
him
to
whom
it
seems
to
be
true
is
satirized
in
contrast
with
these
fallacies
is
maintained
the
socratic
doctrine
that
happiness
is
gained
by
knowledge
the
grammatical
puzzles
with
which
the
dialogue
concludes
probably
contain
allusions
to
tricks
of
language
which
may
have
been
practised
by
the
disciples
of
prodicus
or
antisthenes
they
would
have
had
more
point
if
we
were
acquainted
with
the
writings
against
which
plato
humour
is
directed
most
of
the
jests
appear
to
have
a
serious
meaning
but
we
have
lost
the
clue
to
some
of
them
and
can
not
determine
whether
as
in
the
cratylus
plato
has
or
has
not
mixed
up
purely
unmeaning
fun
with
his
satire
the
two
discourses
of
socrates
may
be
contrasted
in
several
respects
with
the
exhibition
of
the
sophists
in
their
perfect
relevancy
to
the
subject
of
discussion
whereas
the
sophistical
discourses
are
wholly
irrelevant
in
their
enquiring
sympathetic
tone
which
encourages
the
youth
instead
of
him
down
after
the
manner
of
the
two
sophists
in
the
absence
of
any
definite
conclusion
for
while
socrates
and
the
youth
are
agreed
that
philosophy
is
to
be
studied
they
are
not
able
to
arrive
at
any
certain
result
about
the
art
which
is
to
teach
it
this
is
a
question
which
will
hereafter
be
answered
in
the
republic
as
the
conception
of
the
kingly
art
is
more
fully
developed
in
the
politicus
and
the
caricature
of
rhetoric
in
the
gorgias
the
characters
of
the
dialogue
are
easily
intelligible
there
is
socrates
once
more
in
the
character
of
an
old
man
and
his
equal
in
years
crito
the
father
of
critobulus
like
lysimachus
in
the
laches
his
fellow
demesman
apol
to
whom
the
scene
is
narrated
and
who
once
or
twice
interrupts
with
a
remark
after
the
manner
of
the
interlocutor
in
the
phaedo
and
adds
his
commentary
at
the
end
socrates
makes
a
playful
allusion
to
his
habits
there
is
the
youth
cleinias
the
grandson
of
alcibiades
who
may
be
compared
with
lysis
charmides
menexenus
and
other
ingenuous
youths
out
of
whose
mouths
socrates
draws
his
own
lessons
and
to
whom
he
always
seems
to
stand
in
a
kindly
and
sympathetic
relation
crito
will
not
believe
that
socrates
has
not
improved
or
perhaps
invented
the
answers
of
cleinias
compare
phaedrus
the
name
of
the
grandson
of
alcibiades
who
is
described
as
long
dead
greek
and
who
died
at
the
age
of
in
the
year
suggests
not
only
that
the
intended
scene
of
the
euthydemus
could
not
have
been
earlier
than
but
that
as
a
fact
this
dialogue
could
not
have
been
composed
before
at
the
soonest
ctesippus
who
is
the
lover
of
cleinias
has
been
already
introduced
to
us
in
the
lysis
and
seems
there
too
to
deserve
the
character
which
is
here
given
him
of
a
somewhat
uproarious
young
man
but
the
chief
study
of
all
is
the
picture
of
the
two
brothers
who
are
unapproachable
in
their
effrontery
equally
careless
of
what
they
say
to
others
and
of
what
is
said
to
them
and
never
at
a
loss
they
are
ambo
et
cantare
pares
et
respondere
parati
some
superior
degree
of
wit
or
subtlety
is
attributed
to
euthydemus
who
sees
the
trap
in
which
socrates
catches
dionysodorus
the
epilogue
or
conclusion
of
the
dialogue
has
been
criticised
as
inconsistent
with
the
general
scheme
such
a
criticism
is
like
similar
criticisms
on
shakespeare
and
proceeds
upon
a
narrow
notion
of
the
variety
which
the
dialogue
like
the
drama
seems
to
admit
plato
in
the
abundance
of
his
dramatic
power
has
chosen
to
write
a
play
upon
a
play
just
as
he
often
gives
us
an
argument
within
an
argument
at
the
same
time
he
takes
the
opportunity
of
assailing
another
class
of
persons
who
are
as
alien
from
the
spirit
of
philosophy
as
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
the
eclectic
the
syncretist
the
doctrinaire
have
been
apt
to
have
a
bad
name
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
the
persons
whom
plato
ridicules
in
the
epilogue
to
the
euthydemus
are
of
this
class
they
occupy
a
between
philosophy
and
politics
they
keep
out
of
the
dangers
of
politics
and
at
the
same
time
use
philosophy
as
a
means
of
serving
their
own
interests
plato
quaintly
describes
them
as
making
two
good
things
philosophy
and
politics
a
little
worse
by
perverting
the
objects
of
both
men
like
antiphon
or
lysias
would
be
types
of
the
class
out
of
a
regard
to
the
respectabilities
of
life
they
are
disposed
to
censure
the
interest
which
socrates
takes
in
the
exhibition
of
the
two
brothers
they
do
not
understand
any
more
than
crito
that
he
is
pursuing
his
vocation
of
detecting
the
follies
of
mankind
which
he
finds
unpleasant
compare
apol
education
is
the
common
subject
of
all
plato
earlier
dialogues
the
concluding
remark
of
crito
that
he
has
a
difficulty
in
educating
his
two
sons
and
the
advice
of
socrates
to
him
that
he
should
not
give
up
philosophy
because
he
has
no
faith
in
philosophers
seems
to
be
a
preparation
for
the
more
peremptory
declaration
of
the
meno
that
can
not
be
taught
because
there
are
no
teachers
the
reasons
for
placing
the
euthydemus
early
in
the
series
are
the
similarity
in
plan
and
style
to
the
protagoras
charmides
and
lysis
the
relation
of
socrates
to
the
sophists
is
still
that
of
humorous
antagonism
not
as
in
the
later
dialogues
of
plato
of
embittered
hatred
and
the
places
and
persons
have
a
considerable
family
likeness
the
euthydemus
belongs
to
the
socratic
period
in
which
socrates
is
represented
as
willing
to
learn
but
unable
to
teach
and
in
the
spirit
of
xenophon
memorabilia
philosophy
is
defined
as
knowledge
which
will
make
us
happy
we
seem
to
have
passed
the
stage
arrived
at
in
the
protagoras
for
socrates
is
no
longer
discussing
whether
virtue
can
be
taught
from
this
question
he
is
relieved
by
the
ingenuous
declaration
of
the
youth
cleinias
and
not
yet
to
have
reached
the
point
at
which
he
asserts
there
are
no
teachers
such
grounds
are
precarious
as
arguments
from
style
and
plan
are
apt
to
be
greek
but
no
arguments
equally
strong
can
be
urged
in
favour
of
assigning
to
the
euthydemus
any
other
position
in
the

was

socrates
with
whom
you
were
talking
yesterday
at
the
lyceum
there
was
such
a
crowd
around
you
that
i
could
not
get
within
hearing
but
i
caught
a
sight
of
him
over
their
heads
and
i
made
out
as
i
thought
that
he
was
a
stranger
with
whom
you
were
talking
who
was

there
were
two
crito
which
of
them
do
you
mean

the
one
whom
i
mean
was
seated
second
from
you
on
the
side
in
the
middle
was
cleinias
the
young
son
of
axiochus
who
has
wonderfully
grown
he
is
only
about
the
age
of
my
own
critobulus
but
he
is
much
forwarder
and
very
the
other
is
thin
and
looks
younger
than
he
is

he
whom
you
mean

on

there
was

of

socrates
as
to
their
origin
i
believe
that
they
are
natives
of
this
part
of
the
world
and
have
migrated
from
chios
to
thurii
they
were
driven
out
of
thurii
and
have
been
living
for
many
years
past
in
these
regions
as
to
their
wisdom
about
which
you
ask
crito
they
are
wonderful
consummate
i
never
knew
what
the
true
pancratiast
was
before
they
are
simply
made
up
of
fighting
not
like
the
two
acarnanian
brothers
who
fight
with
their
bodies
only
but
this
pair
of
heroes
besides
being
perfect
in
the
use
of
their
bodies
are
invincible
in
every
sort
of
warfare
for
they
are
capital
at
fighting
in
armour
and
will
teach
the
art
to
any
one
who
pays
them
and
also
they
are
most
skilful
in
legal
warfare
they
will
plead
themselves
and
teach
others
to
speak
and
to
compose
speeches
which
will
have
an
effect
upon
the
courts
and
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
their
wisdom
but
they
have
at
last
carried
out
the
pancratiastic
art
to
the
very
end
and
have
mastered
the
only
mode
of
fighting
which
had
been
hitherto
neglected
by
them
and
now
no
one
dares
even
to
stand
up
against
them
such
is
their
skill
in
the
war
of
words
that
they
can
refute
any
proposition
whether
true
or
false
now
i
am
thinking
crito
of
placing
myself
in
their
hands
for
they
say
that
in
a
short
time
they
can
impart
their
skill
to
any
one
crito
but
socrates
are
you
not
too
old
there
may
be
reason
to
fear
that
socrates
certainly
not
crito
as
i
will
prove
to
you
for
i
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
they
began
this
art
of
disputation
which
i
covet
quite
as
i
may
say
in
old
age
last
year
or
the
year
before
they
had
none
of
their
new
wisdom
i
am
only
apprehensive
that
i
may
bring
the
two
strangers
into
disrepute
as
i
have
done
connus
the
son
of
metrobius
the
who
is
still
my
for
when
the
boys
who
go
to
him
see
me
going
with
them
they
laugh
at
me
and
call
him
grandpapa
master
now
i
should
not
like
the
strangers
to
experience
similar
treatment
the
fear
of
ridicule
may
make
them
unwilling
to
receive
me
and
therefore
crito
i
shall
try
and
persuade
some
old
men
to
accompany
me
to
them
as
i
persuaded
them
to
go
with
me
to
connus
and
i
hope
that
you
will
make
one
and
perhaps
we
had
better
take
your
sons
as
a
bait
they
will
want
to
have
them
as
pupils
and
for
the
sake
of
them
willing
to
receive
us
crito
i
see
no
objection
socrates
if
you
like
but
first
i
wish
that
you
would
give
me
a
description
of
their
wisdom
that
i
may
know
beforehand
what
we
are
going
to
learn
socrates
in
less
than
no
time
you
shall
hear
for
i
can
not
say
that
i
did
not
attend
i
paid
great
attention
to
them
and
i
remember
and
will
endeavour
to
repeat
the
whole
story
providentially
i
was
sitting
alone
in
the
of
the
lyceum
where
you
saw
me
and
was
about
to
depart
when
i
was
getting
up
i
recognized
the
familiar
divine
sign
so
i
sat
down
again
and
in
a
little
while
the
two
brothers
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
came
in
and
several
others
with
them
whom
i
believe
to
be
their
disciples
and
they
walked
about
in
the
covered
court
they
had
not
taken
more
than
two
or
three
turns
when
cleinias
entered
who
as
you
truly
say
is
very
much
improved
he
was
followed
by
a
host
of
lovers
one
of
whom
was
ctesippus
the
paeanian
a
youth
but
also
having
the
wildness
of
youth
cleinias
saw
me
from
the
entrance
as
i
was
sitting
alone
and
at
once
came
and
sat
down
on
the
right
hand
of
me
as
you
describe
and
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
when
they
saw
him
at
first
stopped
and
talked
with
one
another
now
and
then
glancing
at
us
for
i
particularly
watched
them
and
then
euthydemus
came
and
sat
down
by
the
youth
and
the
other
by
me
on
the
left
hand
the
rest
anywhere
i
saluted
the
brothers
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
and
then
i
said
to
cleinias
here
are
two
wise
men
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
cleinias
wise
not
in
a
small
but
in
a
large
way
of
wisdom
for
they
know
all
about
war
all
that
a
good
general
ought
to
know
about
the
array
and
command
of
an
army
and
the
whole
art
of
fighting
in
armour
and
they
know
about
law
too
and
can
teach
a
man
how
to
use
the
weapons
of
the
courts
when
he
is
injured
they
heard
me
say
this
but
only
despised
me
i
observed
that
they
looked
at
one
another
and
both
of
them
laughed
and
then
euthydemus
said
those
socrates
are
matters
which
we
no
longer
pursue
seriously
to
us
they
are
secondary
occupations
indeed
i
said
if
such
occupations
are
regarded
by
you
as
secondary
what
must
the
principal
one
be
tell
me
i
beseech
you
what
that
noble
study
is
the
teaching
of
virtue
socrates
he
replied
is
our
principal
occupation
and
we
believe
that
we
can
impart
it
better
and
quicker
than
any
man
my
god
i
said
and
where
did
you
learn
that
i
always
thought
as
i
was
saying
just
now
that
your
chief
accomplishment
was
the
art
of
fighting
in
armour
and
i
used
to
say
as
much
of
you
for
i
remember
that
you
professed
this
when
you
were
here
before
but
now
if
you
really
have
the
other
knowledge
o
forgive
me
i
address
you
as
i
would
superior
beings
and
ask
you
to
pardon
the
impiety
of
my
former
expressions
but
are
you
quite
sure
about
this
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
the
promise
is
so
vast
that
a
feeling
of
incredulity
steals
over
me
you
may
take
our
word
socrates
for
the
fact
then
i
think
you
happier
in
having
such
a
treasure
than
the
great
king
is
in
the
possession
of
his
kingdom
and
please
to
tell
me
whether
you
intend
to
exhibit
your
wisdom
or
what
will
you
do
that
is
why
we
have
come
hither
socrates
and
our
purpose
is
not
only
to
exhibit
but
also
to
teach
any
one
who
likes
to
learn
but
i
can
promise
you
i
said
that
every
unvirtuous
person
will
want
to
learn
i
shall
be
the
first
and
there
is
the
youth
cleinias
and
ctesippus
and
here
are
several
others
i
said
pointing
to
the
lovers
of
cleinias
who
were
beginning
to
gather
round
us
now
ctesippus
was
sitting
at
some
distance
from
cleinias
and
when
euthydemus
leaned
forward
in
talking
with
me
he
was
prevented
from
seeing
cleinias
who
was
between
us
and
so
partly
because
he
wanted
to
look
at
his
love
and
also
because
he
was
interested
he
jumped
up
and
stood
opposite
to
us
and
all
the
other
admirers
of
cleinias
as
well
as
the
disciples
of
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
followed
his
example
and
these
were
the
persons
whom
i
showed
to
euthydemus
telling
him
that
they
were
all
eager
to
learn
to
which
ctesippus
and
all
of
them
with
one
voice
vehemently
assented
and
bid
him
exhibit
the
power
of
his
wisdom
then
i
said
o
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
i
earnestly
request
you
to
do
myself
and
the
company
the
favour
to
exhibit
there
may
be
some
trouble
in
giving
the
whole
exhibition
but
tell
me
one
thing
can
you
make
a
good
man
of
him
only
who
is
already
convinced
that
he
ought
to
learn
of
you
or
of
him
also
who
is
not
convinced
either
because
he
imagines
that
virtue
is
a
thing
which
can
not
be
taught
at
all
or
that
you
are
not
the
teachers
of
it
has
your
art
power
to
persuade
him
who
is
of
the
latter
temper
of
mind
that
virtue
can
be
taught
and
that
you
are
the
men
from
whom
he
will
best
learn
it
certainly
socrates
said
dionysodorus
our
art
will
do
both
and
you
and
your
brother
dionysodorus
i
said
of
all
men
who
are
now
living
are
the
most
likely
to
stimulate
him
to
philosophy
and
to
the
study
of
virtue
yes
socrates
i
rather
think
that
we
are
then
i
wish
that
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
defer
the
other
part
of
the
exhibition
and
only
try
to
persuade
the
youth
whom
you
see
here
that
he
ought
to
be
a
philosopher
and
study
virtue
exhibit
that
and
you
will
confer
a
great
favour
on
me
and
on
every
one
present
for
the
fact
is
i
and
all
of
us
are
extremely
anxious
that
he
should
become
truly
good
his
name
is
cleinias
and
he
is
the
son
of
axiochus
and
grandson
of
the
old
alcibiades
cousin
of
the
alcibiades
that
now
is
he
is
quite
young
and
we
are
naturally
afraid
that
some
one
may
get
the
start
of
us
and
turn
his
mind
in
a
wrong
direction
and
he
may
be
ruined
your
visit
therefore
is
most
happily
timed
and
i
hope
that
you
will
make
a
trial
of
the
young
man
and
converse
with
him
in
our
presence
if
you
have
no
objection
these
were
pretty
nearly
the
expressions
which
i
used
and
euthydemus
in
a
manly
and
at
the
same
time
encouraging
tone
replied
there
can
be
no
objection
socrates
if
the
young
man
is
only
willing
to
answer
questions
he
is
quite
accustomed
to
do
so
i
replied
for
his
friends
often
come
and
ask
him
questions
and
argue
with
him
and
therefore
he
is
quite
at
home
in
answering
what
followed
crito
how
can
i
rightly
narrate
for
not
slight
is
the
task
of
rehearsing
infinite
wisdom
and
therefore
like
the
poets
i
ought
to
commence
my
relation
with
an
invocation
to
memory
and
the
muses
now
euthydemus
if
i
remember
rightly
began
nearly
as
follows
o
cleinias
are
those
who
learn
the
wise
or
the
ignorant
the
youth
overpowered
by
the
question
blushed
and
in
his
perplexity
looked
at
me
for
help
and
i
knowing
that
he
was
disconcerted
said
take
courage
cleinias
and
answer
like
a
man
whichever
you
think
for
my
belief
is
that
you
will
derive
the
greatest
benefit
from
their
questions
whichever
he
answers
said
dionysodorus
leaning
forward
so
as
to
catch
my
ear
his
face
beaming
with
laughter
i
prophesy
that
he
will
be
refuted
socrates
while
he
was
speaking
to
me
cleinias
gave
his
answer
and
therefore
i
had
no
time
to
warn
him
of
the
predicament
in
which
he
was
placed
and
he
answered
that
those
who
learned
were
the
wise
euthydemus
proceeded
there
are
some
whom
you
would
call
teachers
are
there
not
the
boy
assented
and
they
are
the
teachers
of
those
who
learn
the
and
the
used
to
teach
you
and
other
boys
and
you
were
the
learners
yes
and
when
you
were
learners
you
did
not
as
yet
know
the
things
which
you
were
learning
no
he
said
and
were
you
wise
then
no
indeed
he
said
but
if
you
were
not
wise
you
were
unlearned
certainly
you
then
learning
what
you
did
not
know
were
unlearned
when
you
were
learning
the
youth
nodded
assent
then
the
unlearned
learn
and
not
the
wise
cleinias
as
you
imagine
at
these
words
the
followers
of
euthydemus
of
whom
i
spoke
like
a
chorus
at
the
bidding
of
their
director
laughed
and
cheered
then
before
the
youth
had
time
to
recover
his
breath
dionysodorus
cleverly
took
him
in
hand
and
said
yes
cleinias
and
when
the
dictated
anything
to
you
were
they
the
wise
boys
or
the
unlearned
who
learned
the
dictation
the
wise
replied
cleinias
then
after
all
the
wise
are
the
learners
and
not
the
unlearned
and
your
last
answer
to
euthydemus
was
wrong
then
once
more
the
admirers
of
the
two
heroes
in
an
ecstasy
at
their
wisdom
gave
vent
to
another
peal
of
laughter
while
the
rest
of
us
were
silent
and
amazed
euthydemus
observing
this
determined
to
persevere
with
the
youth
and
in
order
to
heighten
the
effect
went
on
asking
another
similar
question
which
might
be
compared
to
the
double
turn
of
an
expert
dancer
do
those
said
he
who
learn
learn
what
they
know
or
what
they
do
not
know
again
dionysodorus
whispered
to
me
that
socrates
is
just
another
of
the
same
sort
good
heavens
i
said
and
your
last
question
was
so
good
like
all
our
other
questions
socrates
he
replied
inevitable
i
see
the
reason
i
said
why
you
are
in
such
reputation
among
your
disciples
meanwhile
cleinias
had
answered
euthydemus
that
those
who
learned
learn
what
they
do
not
know
and
he
put
him
through
a
series
of
questions
the
same
as
before
do
you
not
know
letters
he
assented
all
letters
yes
but
when
the
teacher
dictates
to
you
does
he
not
dictate
letters
to
this
also
he
assented
then
if
you
know
all
letters
he
dictates
that
which
you
know
this
again
was
admitted
by
him
then
said
the
other
you
do
not
learn
that
which
he
dictates
but
he
only
who
does
not
know
letters
learns
nay
said
cleinias
but
i
do
learn
then
said
he
you
learn
what
you
know
if
you
know
all
the
letters
he
admitted
that
then
he
said
you
were
wrong
in
your
answer
the
word
was
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
dionysodorus
took
up
the
argument
like
a
ball
which
he
caught
and
had
another
throw
at
the
youth
cleinias
he
said
euthydemus
is
deceiving
you
for
tell
me
now
is
not
learning
acquiring
knowledge
of
that
which
one
learns
cleinias
assented
and
knowing
is
having
knowledge
at
the
time
he
agreed
and
not
knowing
is
not
having
knowledge
at
the
time
he
admitted
that
and
are
those
who
acquire
those
who
have
or
have
not
a
thing
those
who
have
not
and
have
you
not
admitted
that
those
who
do
not
know
are
of
the
number
of
those
who
have
not
he
nodded
assent
then
those
who
learn
are
of
the
class
of
those
who
acquire
and
not
of
those
who
have
he
agreed
then
cleinias
he
said
those
who
do
not
know
learn
and
not
those
who
know
euthydemus
was
proceeding
to
give
the
youth
a
third
fall
but
i
knew
that
he
was
in
deep
water
and
therefore
as
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
respite
lest
he
should
be
disheartened
i
said
to
him
consolingly
you
must
not
be
surprised
cleinias
at
the
singularity
of
their
mode
of
speech
this
i
say
because
you
may
not
understand
what
the
two
strangers
are
doing
with
you
they
are
only
initiating
you
after
the
manner
of
the
corybantes
in
the
mysteries
and
this
answers
to
the
enthronement
which
if
you
have
ever
been
initiated
is
as
you
will
know
accompanied
by
dancing
and
sport
and
now
they
are
just
prancing
and
dancing
about
you
and
will
next
proceed
to
initiate
you
imagine
then
that
you
have
gone
through
the
first
part
of
the
sophistical
ritual
which
as
prodicus
says
begins
with
initiation
into
the
correct
use
of
terms
the
two
foreign
gentlemen
perceiving
that
you
did
not
know
wanted
to
explain
to
you
that
the
word
learn
has
two
meanings
and
is
used
first
in
the
sense
of
acquiring
knowledge
of
some
matter
of
which
you
previously
have
no
knowledge
and
also
when
you
have
the
knowledge
in
the
sense
of
reviewing
this
matter
whether
something
done
or
spoken
by
the
light
of
this
knowledge
the
latter
is
generally
called
rather
than
but
the
word
is
also
used
and
you
did
not
see
as
they
explained
to
you
that
the
term
is
employed
of
two
opposite
sorts
of
men
of
those
who
know
and
of
those
who
do
not
know
there
was
a
similar
trick
in
the
second
question
when
they
asked
you
whether
men
learn
what
they
know
or
what
they
do
not
know
these
parts
of
learning
are
not
serious
and
therefore
i
say
that
the
gentlemen
are
not
serious
but
are
only
playing
with
you
for
if
a
man
had
all
that
sort
of
knowledge
that
ever
was
he
would
not
be
at
all
the
wiser
he
would
only
be
able
to
play
with
men
tripping
them
up
and
oversetting
them
with
distinctions
of
words
he
would
be
like
a
person
who
pulls
away
a
stool
from
some
one
when
he
is
about
to
sit
down
and
then
laughs
and
makes
merry
at
the
sight
of
his
friend
overturned
and
laid
on
his
back
and
you
must
regard
all
that
has
hitherto
passed
between
you
and
them
as
merely
play
but
in
what
is
to
follow
i
am
certain
that
they
will
exhibit
to
you
their
serious
purpose
and
keep
their
promise
i
will
show
them
how
for
they
promised
to
give
me
a
sample
of
the
hortatory
philosophy
but
i
suppose
that
they
wanted
to
have
a
game
with
you
first
and
now
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
i
think
that
we
have
had
enough
of
this
will
you
let
me
see
you
explaining
to
the
young
man
how
he
is
to
apply
himself
to
the
study
of
virtue
and
wisdom
and
i
will
first
show
you
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
nature
of
the
task
and
what
sort
of
a
discourse
i
desire
to
hear
and
if
i
do
this
in
a
very
inartistic
and
ridiculous
manner
do
not
laugh
at
me
for
i
only
venture
to
improvise
before
you
because
i
am
eager
to
hear
your
wisdom
and
i
must
therefore
ask
you
and
your
disciples
to
refrain
from
laughing
and
now
o
son
of
axiochus
let
me
put
a
question
to
you
do
not
all
men
desire
happiness
and
yet
perhaps
this
is
one
of
those
ridiculous
questions
which
i
am
afraid
to
ask
and
which
ought
not
to
be
asked
by
a
sensible
man
for
what
human
being
is
there
who
does
not
desire
happiness
there
is
no
one
said
cleinias
who
does
not
well
then
i
said
since
we
all
of
us
desire
happiness
how
can
we
be
happy
that
is
the
next
question
shall
we
not
be
happy
if
we
have
many
good
things
and
this
perhaps
is
even
a
more
simple
question
than
the
first
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
answer
he
assented
and
what
things
do
we
esteem
good
no
solemn
sage
is
required
to
tell
us
this
which
may
be
easily
answered
for
every
one
will
say
that
wealth
is
a
good
certainly
he
said
and
are
not
health
and
beauty
goods
and
other
personal
gifts
he
agreed
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
good
birth
and
power
and
honours
in
own
land
are
goods
he
assented
and
what
other
goods
are
there
i
said
what
do
you
say
of
temperance
justice
courage
do
you
not
verily
and
indeed
think
cleinias
that
we
shall
be
more
right
in
ranking
them
as
goods
than
in
not
ranking
them
as
goods
for
a
dispute
might
possibly
arise
about
this
what
then
do
you
say
they
are
goods
said
cleinias
very
well
i
said
and
where
in
the
company
shall
we
find
a
place
for
wisdom
among
the
goods
or
not
among
the
goods
and
now
i
said
think
whether
we
have
left
out
any
considerable
goods
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
said
cleinias
upon
recollection
i
said
indeed
i
am
afraid
that
we
have
left
out
the
greatest
of
them
all
what
is
that
he
asked
fortune
cleinias
i
replied
which
all
even
the
most
foolish
admit
to
be
the
greatest
of
goods
true
he
said
on
second
thoughts
i
added
how
narrowly
o
son
of
axiochus
have
you
and
i
escaped
making
a
of
ourselves
to
the
strangers
why
do
you
say
so
why
because
we
have
already
spoken
of
and
are
but
repeating
ourselves
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
there
is
something
ridiculous
in
again
putting
forward
which
has
a
place
in
the
list
already
and
saying
the
same
thing
twice
over
he
asked
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
and
i
replied
surely
wisdom
is
even
a
child
may
know
that
the
youth
was
amazed
and
observing
his
surprise
i
said
to
him
do
you
not
know
cleinias
that
are
most
fortunate
and
successful
in
performing
on
the
flute
he
assented
and
are
not
the
scribes
most
fortunate
in
writing
and
reading
letters
certainly
amid
the
dangers
of
the
sea
again
are
any
more
fortunate
on
the
whole
than
wise
pilots
none
certainly
and
if
you
were
engaged
in
war
in
whose
company
would
you
rather
take
the
risk
in
company
with
a
wise
general
or
with
a
foolish
one
with
a
wise
one
and
if
you
were
ill
whom
would
you
rather
have
as
a
companion
in
a
dangerous
illness
a
wise
physician
or
an
ignorant
one
a
wise
one
you
think
i
said
that
to
act
with
a
wise
man
is
more
fortunate
than
to
act
with
an
ignorant
one
he
assented
then
wisdom
always
makes
men
fortunate
for
by
wisdom
no
man
would
ever
err
and
therefore
he
must
act
rightly
and
succeed
or
his
wisdom
would
be
wisdom
no
longer
we
contrived
at
last
somehow
or
other
to
agree
in
a
general
conclusion
that
he
who
had
wisdom
had
no
need
of
fortune
i
then
recalled
to
his
mind
the
previous
state
of
the
question
you
remember
i
said
our
making
the
admission
that
we
should
be
happy
and
fortunate
if
many
good
things
were
present
with
us
he
assented
and
should
we
be
happy
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
good
things
if
they
profited
us
not
or
if
they
profited
us
if
they
profited
us
he
said
and
would
they
profit
us
if
we
only
had
them
and
did
not
use
them
for
example
if
we
had
a
great
deal
of
food
and
did
not
eat
or
a
great
deal
of
drink
and
did
not
drink
should
we
be
profited
certainly
not
he
said
or
would
an
artisan
who
had
all
the
implements
necessary
for
his
work
and
did
not
use
them
be
any
the
better
for
the
possession
of
them
for
example
would
a
carpenter
be
any
the
better
for
having
all
his
tools
and
plenty
of
wood
if
he
never
worked
certainly
not
he
said
and
if
a
person
had
wealth
and
all
the
goods
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
and
did
not
use
them
would
he
be
happy
because
he
possessed
them
no
indeed
socrates
then
i
said
a
man
who
would
be
happy
must
not
only
have
the
good
things
but
he
must
also
use
them
there
is
no
advantage
in
merely
having
them
true
well
cleinias
but
if
you
have
the
use
as
well
as
the
possession
of
good
things
is
that
sufficient
to
confer
happiness
yes
in
my
opinion
and
may
a
person
use
them
either
rightly
or
wrongly
he
must
use
them
rightly
that
is
quite
true
i
said
and
the
wrong
use
of
a
thing
is
far
worse
than
the
for
the
one
is
an
evil
and
the
other
is
neither
a
good
nor
an
evil
you
admit
that
he
assented
now
in
the
working
and
use
of
wood
is
not
that
which
gives
the
right
use
simply
the
knowledge
of
the
carpenter
nothing
else
he
said
and
surely
in
the
manufacture
of
vessels
knowledge
is
that
which
gives
the
right
way
of
making
them
he
agreed
and
in
the
use
of
the
goods
of
which
we
spoke
at
first
wealth
and
health
and
beauty
is
not
knowledge
that
which
directs
us
to
the
right
use
of
them
and
regulates
our
practice
about
them
he
assented
then
in
every
possession
and
every
use
of
a
thing
knowledge
is
that
which
gives
a
man
not
only
but
success
he
again
assented
and
tell
me
i
said
o
tell
me
what
do
possessions
profit
a
man
if
he
have
neither
good
sense
nor
wisdom
would
a
man
be
better
off
having
and
doing
many
things
without
wisdom
or
a
few
things
with
wisdom
look
at
the
matter
thus
if
he
did
fewer
things
would
he
not
make
fewer
mistakes
if
he
made
fewer
mistakes
would
he
not
have
fewer
misfortunes
and
if
he
had
fewer
misfortunes
would
he
not
be
less
miserable
certainly
he
said
and
who
would
do
least
a
poor
man
or
a
rich
man
a
poor
man
a
weak
man
or
a
strong
man
a
weak
man
a
noble
man
or
a
mean
man
a
mean
man
and
a
coward
would
do
less
than
a
courageous
and
temperate
man
yes
and
an
indolent
man
less
than
an
active
man
he
assented
and
a
slow
man
less
than
a
quick
and
one
who
had
dull
perceptions
of
seeing
and
hearing
less
than
one
who
had
keen
ones
all
this
was
mutually
allowed
by
us
then
i
said
cleinias
the
sum
of
the
matter
appears
to
be
that
the
goods
of
which
we
spoke
before
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
goods
in
themselves
but
the
degree
of
good
and
evil
in
them
depends
on
whether
they
are
or
are
not
under
the
guidance
of
knowledge
under
the
guidance
of
ignorance
they
are
greater
evils
than
their
opposites
inasmuch
as
they
are
more
able
to
minister
to
the
evil
principle
which
rules
them
and
when
under
the
guidance
of
wisdom
and
prudence
they
are
greater
goods
but
in
themselves
they
are
nothing
that
he
replied
is
obvious
what
then
is
the
result
of
what
has
been
said
is
not
this
the
result
that
other
things
are
indifferent
and
that
wisdom
is
the
only
good
and
ignorance
the
only
evil
he
assented
let
us
consider
a
further
point
i
said
seeing
that
all
men
desire
happiness
and
happiness
as
has
been
shown
is
gained
by
a
use
and
a
right
use
of
the
things
of
life
and
the
right
use
of
them
and
in
the
use
of
them
is
given
by
knowledge
the
inference
is
that
everybody
ought
by
all
means
to
try
and
make
himself
as
wise
as
he
can
yes
he
said
and
when
a
man
thinks
that
he
ought
to
obtain
this
treasure
far
more
than
money
from
a
father
or
a
guardian
or
a
friend
or
a
suitor
whether
citizen
or
stranger
the
eager
desire
and
prayer
to
them
that
they
would
impart
wisdom
to
you
is
not
at
all
dishonourable
cleinias
nor
is
any
one
to
be
blamed
for
doing
any
honourable
service
or
ministration
to
any
man
whether
a
lover
or
not
if
his
aim
is
to
get
wisdom
do
you
agree
i
said
yes
he
said
i
quite
agree
and
think
that
you
are
right
yes
i
said
cleinias
if
only
wisdom
can
be
taught
and
does
not
come
to
man
spontaneously
for
this
is
a
point
which
has
still
to
be
considered
and
is
not
yet
agreed
upon
by
you
and
me
but
i
think
socrates
that
wisdom
can
be
taught
he
said
best
of
men
i
said
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
and
i
am
also
grateful
to
you
for
having
saved
me
from
a
long
and
tiresome
investigation
as
to
whether
wisdom
can
be
taught
or
not
but
now
as
you
think
that
wisdom
can
be
taught
and
that
wisdom
only
can
make
a
man
happy
and
fortunate
will
you
not
acknowledge
that
all
of
us
ought
to
love
wisdom
and
you
individually
will
try
to
love
her
certainly
socrates
he
said
i
will
do
my
best
i
was
pleased
at
hearing
this
and
i
turned
to
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
and
said
that
is
an
example
clumsy
and
tedious
i
admit
of
the
sort
of
exhortations
which
i
would
have
you
give
and
i
hope
that
one
of
you
will
set
forth
what
i
have
been
saying
in
a
more
artistic
style
or
at
least
take
up
the
enquiry
where
i
left
off
and
proceed
to
show
the
youth
whether
he
should
have
all
knowledge
or
whether
there
is
one
sort
of
knowledge
only
which
will
make
him
good
and
happy
and
what
that
is
for
as
i
was
saying
at
first
the
improvement
of
this
young
man
in
virtue
and
wisdom
is
a
matter
which
we
have
very
much
at
heart
thus
i
spoke
crito
and
was
all
attention
to
what
was
coming
i
wanted
to
see
how
they
would
approach
the
question
and
where
they
would
start
in
their
exhortation
to
the
young
man
that
he
should
practise
wisdom
and
virtue
dionysodorus
who
was
the
elder
spoke
first
everybody
eyes
were
directed
towards
him
perceiving
that
something
wonderful
might
shortly
be
expected
and
certainly
they
were
not
far
wrong
for
the
man
crito
began
a
remarkable
discourse
well
worth
hearing
and
wonderfully
persuasive
regarded
as
an
exhortation
to
virtue
tell
me
he
said
socrates
and
the
rest
of
you
who
say
that
you
want
this
young
man
to
become
wise
are
you
in
jest
or
in
real
earnest
i
was
led
by
this
to
imagine
that
they
fancied
us
to
have
been
jesting
when
we
asked
them
to
converse
with
the
youth
and
that
this
made
them
jest
and
play
and
being
under
this
impression
i
was
the
more
decided
in
saying
that
we
were
in
profound
earnest
dionysodorus
said
reflect
socrates
you
may
have
to
deny
your
words
i
have
reflected
i
said
and
i
shall
never
deny
my
words
well
said
he
and
so
you
say
that
you
wish
cleinias
to
become
wise
undoubtedly
and
he
is
not
wise
as
yet
at
least
his
modesty
will
not
allow
him
to
say
that
he
is
you
wish
him
he
said
to
become
wise
and
not
to
be
ignorant
that
we
do
you
wish
him
to
be
what
he
is
not
and
no
longer
to
be
what
he
is
i
was
thrown
into
consternation
at
this
taking
advantage
of
my
consternation
he
added
you
wish
him
no
longer
to
be
what
he
is
which
can
only
mean
that
you
wish
him
to
perish
pretty
lovers
and
friends
they
must
be
who
want
their
favourite
not
to
be
or
to
perish
when
ctesippus
heard
this
he
got
very
angry
as
a
lover
well
might
and
said
stranger
of
thurii
if
politeness
would
allow
me
i
should
say
a
plague
upon
you
what
can
make
you
tell
such
a
lie
about
me
and
the
others
which
i
hardly
like
to
repeat
as
that
i
wish
cleinias
to
perish
euthydemus
replied
and
do
you
think
ctesippus
that
it
is
possible
to
tell
a
lie
yes
said
ctesippus
i
should
be
mad
to
say
anything
else
and
in
telling
a
lie
do
you
tell
the
thing
of
which
you
speak
or
not
you
tell
the
thing
of
which
you
speak
and
he
who
tells
tells
that
thing
which
he
tells
and
no
other
yes
said
ctesippus
and
that
is
a
distinct
thing
apart
from
other
things
certainly
and
he
who
says
that
thing
says
that
which
is
yes
and
he
who
says
that
which
is
says
the
truth
and
therefore
dionysodorus
if
he
says
that
which
is
says
the
truth
of
you
and
no
lie
yes
euthydemus
said
ctesippus
but
in
saying
this
he
says
what
is
not
euthydemus
answered
and
that
which
is
not
is
not
true
and
that
which
is
not
is
nowhere
nowhere
and
can
any
one
do
anything
about
that
which
has
no
existence
or
do
to
cleinias
that
which
is
not
and
is
nowhere
i
think
not
said
ctesippus
well
but
do
rhetoricians
when
they
speak
in
the
assembly
do
nothing
nay
he
said
they
do
something
and
doing
is
making
yes
and
speaking
is
doing
and
making
he
agreed
then
no
one
says
that
which
is
not
for
in
saying
what
is
not
he
would
be
doing
something
and
you
have
already
acknowledged
that
no
one
can
do
what
is
not
and
therefore
upon
your
own
showing
no
one
says
what
is
false
but
if
dionysodorus
says
anything
he
says
what
is
true
and
what
is
yes
euthydemus
said
ctesippus
but
he
speaks
of
things
in
a
certain
way
and
manner
and
not
as
they
really
are
why
ctesippus
said
dionysodorus
do
you
mean
to
say
that
any
one
speaks
of
things
as
they
are
yes
he
said
all
gentlemen
and
persons
and
are
not
good
things
good
and
evil
things
evil
he
assented
and
you
say
that
gentlemen
speak
of
things
as
they
are
yes
then
the
good
speak
evil
of
evil
things
if
they
speak
of
them
as
they
are
yes
indeed
he
said
and
they
speak
evil
of
evil
men
and
if
i
may
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
you
had
better
take
care
that
they
do
not
speak
evil
of
you
since
i
can
tell
you
that
the
good
speak
evil
of
the
evil
and
do
they
speak
great
things
of
the
great
rejoined
euthydemus
and
warm
things
of
the
warm
to
be
sure
they
do
said
ctesippus
and
they
speak
coldly
of
the
insipid
and
cold
dialectician
you
are
abusive
ctesippus
said
dionysodorus
you
are
abusive
indeed
i
am
not
dionysodorus
he
replied
for
i
love
you
and
am
giving
you
friendly
advice
and
if
i
could
would
persuade
you
not
like
a
boor
to
say
in
my
presence
that
i
desire
my
beloved
whom
i
value
above
all
men
to
perish
i
saw
that
they
were
getting
exasperated
with
one
another
so
i
made
a
joke
with
him
and
said
o
ctesippus
i
think
that
we
must
allow
the
strangers
to
use
language
in
their
own
way
and
not
quarrel
with
them
about
words
but
be
thankful
for
what
they
give
us
if
they
know
how
to
destroy
men
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
good
and
sensible
men
out
of
bad
and
foolish
ones
whether
this
is
a
discovery
of
their
own
or
whether
they
have
learned
from
some
one
else
this
new
sort
of
death
and
destruction
which
enables
them
to
get
rid
of
a
bad
man
and
turn
him
into
a
good
one
if
they
know
this
and
they
do
know
this
at
any
rate
they
said
just
now
that
this
was
the
secret
of
their
art
let
them
in
their
phraseology
destroy
the
youth
and
make
him
wise
and
all
of
us
with
him
but
if
you
young
men
do
not
like
to
trust
yourselves
with
them
then
fiat
experimentum
in
corpore
senis
i
will
be
the
carian
on
whom
they
shall
operate
and
here
i
offer
my
old
person
to
dionysodorus
he
may
put
me
into
the
pot
like
medea
the
colchian
kill
me
boil
me
if
he
will
only
make
me
good
ctesippus
said
and
i
socrates
am
ready
to
commit
myself
to
the
strangers
they
may
skin
me
alive
if
they
please
and
i
am
pretty
well
skinned
by
them
already
if
only
my
skin
is
made
at
last
not
like
that
of
marsyas
into
a
leathern
bottle
but
into
a
piece
of
virtue
and
here
is
dionysodorus
fancying
that
i
am
angry
with
him
when
really
i
am
not
angry
at
all
i
do
but
contradict
him
when
i
think
that
he
is
speaking
improperly
to
me
and
you
must
not
confound
abuse
and
contradiction
o
illustrious
dionysodorus
for
they
are
quite
different
things
contradiction
said
dionysodorus
why
there
never
was
such
a
thing
certainly
there
is
he
replied
there
can
be
no
question
of
that
do
you
dionysodorus
maintain
that
there
is
not
you
will
never
prove
to
me
he
said
that
you
have
heard
any
one
contradicting
any
one
else
indeed
said
ctesippus
then
now
you
may
hear
me
contradicting
dionysodorus
are
you
prepared
to
make
that
good
certainly
he
said
well
have
not
all
things
words
expressive
of
them
yes
of
their
existence
or
of
their
of
their
existence
yes
ctesippus
and
we
just
now
proved
as
you
may
remember
that
no
man
could
affirm
a
negative
for
no
one
could
affirm
that
which
is
not
and
what
does
that
signify
said
ctesippus
you
and
i
may
contradict
all
the
same
for
that
but
can
we
contradict
one
another
said
dionysodorus
when
both
of
us
are
describing
the
same
thing
then
we
must
surely
be
speaking
the
same
thing
he
assented
or
when
neither
of
us
is
speaking
of
the
same
thing
for
then
neither
of
us
says
a
word
about
the
thing
at
all
he
granted
that
proposition
also
but
when
i
describe
something
and
you
describe
another
thing
or
i
say
something
and
you
say
nothing
is
there
any
contradiction
how
can
he
who
speaks
contradict
him
who
speaks
not
here
ctesippus
was
silent
and
i
in
my
astonishment
said
what
do
you
mean
dionysodorus
i
have
often
heard
and
have
been
amazed
to
hear
this
thesis
of
yours
which
is
maintained
and
employed
by
the
disciples
of
protagoras
and
others
before
them
and
which
to
me
appears
to
be
quite
wonderful
and
suicidal
as
well
as
destructive
and
i
think
that
i
am
most
likely
to
hear
the
truth
about
it
from
you
the
dictum
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
falsehood
a
man
must
either
say
what
is
true
or
say
nothing
is
not
that
your
position
he
assented
but
if
he
can
not
speak
falsely
may
he
not
think
falsely
no
he
can
not
he
said
then
there
is
no
such
thing
as
false
opinion
no
he
said
then
there
is
no
such
thing
as
ignorance
or
men
who
are
ignorant
for
is
not
ignorance
if
there
be
such
a
thing
a
mistake
of
fact
certainly
he
said
and
that
is
impossible
impossible
he
replied
are
you
saying
this
as
a
paradox
dionysodorus
or
do
you
seriously
maintain
no
man
to
be
ignorant
refute
me
he
said
but
how
can
i
refute
you
if
as
you
say
to
tell
a
falsehood
is
impossible
very
true
said
euthydemus
neither
did
i
tell
you
just
now
to
refute
me
said
dionysodorus
for
how
can
i
tell
you
to
do
that
which
is
not
o
euthydemus
i
said
i
have
but
a
dull
conception
of
these
subtleties
and
excellent
devices
of
wisdom
i
am
afraid
that
i
hardly
understand
them
and
you
must
forgive
me
therefore
if
i
ask
a
very
stupid
question
if
there
be
no
falsehood
or
false
opinion
or
ignorance
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
erroneous
action
for
a
man
can
not
fail
of
acting
as
he
is
acting
that
is
what
you
mean
yes
he
replied
and
now
i
said
i
will
ask
my
stupid
question
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
error
in
deed
word
or
thought
then
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
do
you
come
hither
to
teach
and
were
you
not
just
now
saying
that
you
could
teach
virtue
best
of
all
men
to
any
one
who
was
willing
to
learn
and
are
you
such
an
old
fool
socrates
rejoined
dionysodorus
that
you
bring
up
now
what
i
said
at
first
and
if
i
had
said
anything
last
year
i
suppose
that
you
would
bring
that
up
too
but
are
at
the
words
which
i
have
just
uttered
why
i
said
they
are
not
easy
to
answer
for
they
are
the
words
of
wise
men
and
indeed
i
know
not
what
to
make
of
this
word
which
you
used
last
what
do
you
mean
by
it
dionysodorus
you
must
mean
that
i
can
not
refute
your
argument
tell
me
if
the
words
have
any
other
sense
no
he
replied
they
mean
what
you
say
and
now
answer
what
before
you
dionysodorus
i
said
answer
said
he
and
is
that
fair
yes
quite
fair
he
said
upon
what
principle
i
said
i
can
only
suppose
that
you
are
a
very
wise
man
who
comes
to
us
in
the
character
of
a
great
logician
and
who
knows
when
to
answer
and
when
not
to
answer
and
now
you
will
not
open
your
mouth
at
all
because
you
know
that
you
ought
not
you
prate
he
said
instead
of
answering
but
if
my
good
sir
you
admit
that
i
am
wise
answer
as
i
tell
you
i
suppose
that
i
must
obey
for
you
are
master
put
the
question
are
the
things
which
have
sense
alive
or
lifeless
they
are
alive
and
do
you
know
of
any
word
which
is
alive
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
then
why
did
you
ask
me
what
sense
my
words
had
why
because
i
was
stupid
and
made
a
mistake
and
yet
perhaps
i
was
right
after
all
in
saying
that
words
have
a
sense
what
do
you
say
wise
man
if
i
was
not
in
error
even
you
will
not
refute
me
and
all
your
wisdom
will
be
but
if
i
did
fall
into
error
then
again
you
are
wrong
in
saying
that
there
is
no
error
and
this
remark
was
made
by
you
not
quite
a
year
ago
i
am
inclined
to
think
however
dionysodorus
and
euthydemus
that
this
argument
lies
where
it
was
and
is
not
very
likely
to
advance
even
your
skill
in
the
subtleties
of
logic
which
is
really
amazing
has
not
found
out
the
way
of
throwing
another
and
not
falling
yourself
now
any
more
than
of
old
ctesippus
said
men
of
chios
thurii
or
however
and
whatever
you
call
yourselves
i
wonder
at
you
for
you
seem
to
have
no
objection
to
talking
nonsense
fearing
that
there
would
be
high
words
i
again
endeavoured
to
soothe
ctesippus
and
said
to
him
to
you
ctesippus
i
must
repeat
what
i
said
before
to
cleinias
that
you
do
not
understand
the
ways
of
these
philosophers
from
abroad
they
are
not
serious
but
like
the
egyptian
wizard
proteus
they
take
different
forms
and
deceive
us
by
their
enchantments
and
let
us
like
menelaus
refuse
to
let
them
go
until
they
show
themselves
to
us
in
earnest
when
they
begin
to
be
in
earnest
their
full
beauty
will
appear
let
us
then
beg
and
entreat
and
beseech
them
to
shine
forth
and
i
think
that
i
had
better
once
more
exhibit
the
form
in
which
i
pray
to
behold
them
it
might
be
a
guide
to
them
i
will
go
on
therefore
where
i
left
off
as
well
as
i
can
in
the
hope
that
i
may
touch
their
hearts
and
move
them
to
pity
and
that
when
they
see
me
deeply
serious
and
interested
they
also
may
be
serious
you
cleinias
i
said
shall
remind
me
at
what
point
we
left
off
did
we
not
agree
that
philosophy
should
be
studied
and
was
not
that
our
conclusion
yes
he
replied
and
philosophy
is
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
yes
he
said
and
what
knowledge
ought
we
to
acquire
may
we
not
answer
with
absolute
truth
a
knowledge
which
will
do
us
good
certainly
he
said
and
should
we
be
any
the
better
if
we
went
about
having
a
knowledge
of
the
places
where
most
gold
was
hidden
in
the
earth
perhaps
we
should
he
said
but
have
we
not
already
proved
i
said
that
we
should
be
none
the
better
off
even
if
without
trouble
and
digging
all
the
gold
which
there
is
in
the
earth
were
ours
and
if
we
knew
how
to
convert
stones
into
gold
the
knowledge
would
be
of
no
value
to
us
unless
we
also
knew
how
to
use
the
gold
do
you
not
remember
i
said
i
quite
remember
he
said
nor
would
any
other
knowledge
whether
of
or
of
medicine
or
of
any
other
art
which
knows
only
how
to
make
a
thing
and
not
to
use
it
when
made
be
of
any
good
to
us
am
i
not
right
he
agreed
and
if
there
were
a
knowledge
which
was
able
to
make
men
immortal
without
giving
them
the
knowledge
of
the
way
to
use
the
immortality
neither
would
there
be
any
use
in
that
if
we
may
argue
from
the
analogy
of
the
previous
instances
to
all
this
he
agreed
then
my
dear
boy
i
said
the
knowledge
which
we
want
is
one
that
uses
as
well
as
makes
true
he
said
and
our
desire
is
not
to
be
skilful
or
artists
of
that
sort
far
otherwise
for
with
them
the
art
which
makes
is
one
and
the
art
which
uses
is
another
although
they
have
to
do
with
the
same
they
are
divided
for
the
art
which
makes
and
the
art
which
plays
on
the
lyre
differ
widely
from
one
another
am
i
not
right
he
agreed
and
clearly
we
do
not
want
the
art
of
the
this
is
only
another
of
the
same
sort
he
assented
but
suppose
i
said
that
we
were
to
learn
the
art
of
making
speeches
would
that
be
the
art
which
would
make
us
happy
i
should
say
no
rejoined
cleinias
and
why
should
you
say
so
i
asked
i
see
he
replied
that
there
are
some
composers
of
speeches
who
do
not
know
how
to
use
the
speeches
which
they
make
just
as
the
makers
of
lyres
do
not
know
how
to
use
the
lyres
and
also
some
who
are
of
themselves
unable
to
compose
speeches
but
are
able
to
use
the
speeches
which
the
others
make
for
them
and
this
proves
that
the
art
of
making
speeches
is
not
the
same
as
the
art
of
using
them
yes
i
said
and
i
take
your
words
to
be
a
sufficient
proof
that
the
art
of
making
speeches
is
not
one
which
will
make
a
man
happy
and
yet
i
did
think
that
the
art
which
we
have
so
long
been
seeking
might
be
discovered
in
that
direction
for
the
composers
of
speeches
whenever
i
meet
them
always
appear
to
me
to
be
very
extraordinary
men
cleinias
and
their
art
is
lofty
and
divine
and
no
wonder
for
their
art
is
a
part
of
the
great
art
of
enchantment
and
hardly
if
at
all
inferior
to
it
and
whereas
the
art
of
the
enchanter
is
a
mode
of
charming
snakes
and
spiders
and
scorpions
and
other
monsters
and
pests
this
art
of
their
acts
upon
dicasts
and
ecclesiasts
and
bodies
of
men
for
the
charming
and
pacifying
of
them
do
you
agree
with
me
yes
he
said
i
think
that
you
are
quite
right
whither
then
shall
we
go
i
said
and
to
what
art
shall
we
have
recourse
i
do
not
see
my
way
he
said
but
i
think
that
i
do
i
replied
and
what
is
your
notion
asked
cleinias
i
think
that
the
art
of
the
general
is
above
all
others
the
one
of
which
the
possession
is
most
likely
to
make
a
man
happy
i
do
not
think
so
he
said
why
not
i
said
the
art
of
the
general
is
surely
an
art
of
hunting
mankind
what
of
that
i
said
why
he
said
no
art
of
hunting
extends
beyond
hunting
and
capturing
and
when
the
prey
is
taken
the
huntsman
or
fisherman
can
not
use
it
but
they
hand
it
over
to
the
cook
and
the
geometricians
and
astronomers
and
calculators
who
all
belong
to
the
hunting
class
for
they
do
not
make
their
diagrams
but
only
find
out
that
which
was
previously
contained
in
them
they
i
say
not
being
able
to
use
but
only
to
catch
their
prey
hand
over
their
inventions
to
the
dialectician
to
be
applied
by
him
if
they
have
any
sense
in
them
good
i
said
fairest
and
wisest
cleinias
and
is
this
true
certainly
he
said
just
as
a
general
when
he
takes
a
city
or
a
camp
hands
over
his
new
acquisition
to
the
statesman
for
he
does
not
know
how
to
use
them
himself
or
as
the
transfers
the
quails
to
the
keeper
of
them
if
we
are
looking
for
the
art
which
is
to
make
us
blessed
and
which
is
able
to
use
that
which
it
makes
or
takes
the
art
of
the
general
is
not
the
one
and
some
other
must
be
found
crito
and
do
you
mean
socrates
that
the
youngster
said
all
this
socrates
are
you
incredulous
crito
crito
indeed
i
am
for
if
he
did
say
so
then
in
my
opinion
he
needs
neither
euthydemus
nor
any
one
else
to
be
his
instructor
socrates
perhaps
i
may
have
forgotten
and
ctesippus
was
the
real
answerer
crito
ctesippus
nonsense
socrates
all
i
know
is
that
i
heard
these
words
and
that
they
were
not
spoken
either
by
euthydemus
or
dionysodorus
i
dare
say
my
good
crito
that
they
may
have
been
spoken
by
some
superior
person
that
i
heard
them
i
am
certain
crito
yes
indeed
socrates
by
some
one
a
good
deal
superior
as
i
should
be
disposed
to
think
but
did
you
carry
the
search
any
further
and
did
you
find
the
art
which
you
were
seeking
socrates
find
my
dear
sir
no
indeed
and
we
cut
a
poor
figure
we
were
like
children
after
larks
always
on
the
point
of
catching
the
art
which
was
always
getting
away
from
us
but
why
should
i
repeat
the
whole
story
at
last
we
came
to
the
kingly
art
and
enquired
whether
that
gave
and
caused
happiness
and
then
we
got
into
a
labyrinth
and
when
we
thought
we
were
at
the
end
came
out
again
at
the
beginning
having
still
to
seek
as
much
as
ever
crito
how
did
that
happen
socrates
socrates
i
will
tell
you
the
kingly
art
was
identified
by
us
with
the
political
crito
well
and
what
came
of
that
socrates
to
this
royal
or
political
art
all
the
arts
including
the
art
of
the
general
seemed
to
render
up
the
supremacy
that
being
the
only
one
which
knew
how
to
use
what
they
produce
here
obviously
was
the
very
art
which
we
were
seeking
the
art
which
is
the
source
of
good
government
and
which
may
be
described
in
the
language
of
aeschylus
as
alone
sitting
at
the
helm
of
the
vessel
of
state
piloting
and
governing
all
things
and
utilizing
them
crito
and
were
you
not
right
socrates
socrates
you
shall
judge
crito
if
you
are
willing
to
hear
what
followed
for
we
resumed
the
enquiry
and
a
question
of
this
sort
was
asked
does
the
kingly
art
having
this
supreme
authority
do
anything
for
us
to
be
sure
was
the
answer
and
would
not
you
crito
say
the
same
crito
yes
i
should
socrates
and
what
would
you
say
that
the
kingly
art
does
if
medicine
were
supposed
to
have
supreme
authority
over
the
subordinate
arts
and
i
were
to
ask
you
a
similar
question
about
that
you
would
say
it
produces
health
crito
i
should
socrates
and
what
of
your
own
art
of
husbandry
supposing
that
to
have
supreme
authority
over
the
subject
arts
what
does
that
do
does
it
not
supply
us
with
the
fruits
of
the
earth
crito
yes
socrates
and
what
does
the
kingly
art
do
when
invested
with
supreme
power
perhaps
you
may
not
be
ready
with
an
answer
crito
indeed
i
am
not
socrates
socrates
no
more
were
we
crito
but
at
any
rate
you
know
that
if
this
is
the
art
which
we
were
seeking
it
ought
to
be
useful
crito
certainly
socrates
and
surely
it
ought
to
do
us
some
good
crito
certainly
socrates
socrates
and
cleinias
and
i
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
knowledge
of
some
kind
is
the
only
good
crito
yes
that
was
what
you
were
saying
socrates
all
the
other
results
of
politics
and
they
are
many
as
for
example
wealth
freedom
tranquillity
were
neither
good
nor
evil
in
themselves
but
the
political
science
ought
to
make
us
wise
and
impart
knowledge
to
us
if
that
is
the
science
which
is
likely
to
do
us
good
and
make
us
happy
crito
yes
that
was
the
conclusion
at
which
you
had
arrived
according
to
your
report
of
the
conversation
socrates
and
does
the
kingly
art
make
men
wise
and
good
crito
why
not
socrates
socrates
what
all
men
and
in
every
respect
and
teach
them
all
the
arts
carpentering
and
cobbling
and
the
rest
of
them
crito
i
think
not
socrates
socrates
but
then
what
is
this
knowledge
and
what
are
we
to
do
with
it
for
it
is
not
the
source
of
any
works
which
are
neither
good
nor
evil
and
gives
no
knowledge
but
the
knowledge
of
itself
what
then
can
it
be
and
what
are
we
to
do
with
it
shall
we
say
crito
that
it
is
the
knowledge
by
which
we
are
to
make
other
men
good
crito
by
all
means
socrates
and
in
what
will
they
be
good
and
useful
shall
we
repeat
that
they
will
make
others
good
and
that
these
others
will
make
others
again
without
ever
determining
in
what
they
are
to
be
good
for
we
have
put
aside
the
results
of
politics
as
they
are
called
this
is
the
old
old
song
over
again
and
we
are
just
as
far
as
ever
if
not
farther
from
the
knowledge
of
the
art
or
science
of
happiness
crito
indeed
socrates
you
do
appear
to
have
got
into
a
great
perplexity
socrates
thereupon
crito
seeing
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
shipwreck
i
lifted
up
my
voice
and
earnestly
entreated
and
called
upon
the
strangers
to
save
me
and
the
youth
from
the
whirlpool
of
the
argument
they
were
our
castor
and
pollux
i
said
and
they
should
be
serious
and
show
us
in
sober
earnest
what
that
knowledge
was
which
would
enable
us
to
pass
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
happiness
crito
and
did
euthydemus
show
you
this
knowledge
socrates
yes
indeed
he
proceeded
in
a
lofty
strain
to
the
following
effect
would
you
rather
socrates
said
he
that
i
should
show
you
this
knowledge
about
which
you
have
been
doubting
or
shall
i
prove
that
you
already
have
it
what
i
said
are
you
blessed
with
such
a
power
as
this
indeed
i
am
then
i
would
much
rather
that
you
should
prove
me
to
have
such
a
knowledge
at
my
time
of
life
that
will
be
more
agreeable
than
having
to
learn
then
tell
me
he
said
do
you
know
anything
yes
i
said
i
know
many
things
but
not
anything
of
much
importance
that
will
do
he
said
and
would
you
admit
that
anything
is
what
it
is
and
at
the
same
time
is
not
what
it
is
certainly
not
and
did
you
not
say
that
you
knew
something
i
did
if
you
know
you
are
knowing
certainly
of
the
knowledge
which
i
have
that
makes
no
difference
and
must
you
not
if
you
are
knowing
know
all
things
certainly
not
i
said
for
there
are
many
other
things
which
i
do
not
know
and
if
you
do
not
know
you
are
not
knowing
yes
friend
of
that
which
i
do
not
know
still
you
are
not
knowing
and
you
said
just
now
that
you
were
knowing
and
therefore
you
are
and
are
not
at
the
same
time
and
in
reference
to
the
same
things
a
pretty
clatter
as
men
say
euthydemus
this
of
yours
and
will
you
explain
how
i
possess
that
knowledge
for
which
we
were
seeking
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
same
thing
can
not
be
and
also
not
be
and
therefore
since
i
know
one
thing
that
i
know
all
for
i
can
not
be
knowing
and
not
knowing
at
the
same
time
and
if
i
know
all
things
then
i
must
have
the
knowledge
for
which
we
are
seeking
may
i
assume
this
to
be
your
ingenious
notion
out
of
your
own
mouth
socrates
you
are
convicted
he
said
well
but
euthydemus
i
said
has
that
never
happened
to
you
for
if
i
am
only
in
the
same
case
with
you
and
our
beloved
dionysodorus
i
can
not
complain
tell
me
then
you
two
do
you
not
know
some
things
and
not
know
others
certainly
not
socrates
said
dionysodorus
what
do
you
mean
i
said
do
you
know
nothing
nay
he
replied
we
do
know
something
then
i
said
you
know
all
things
if
you
know
anything
yes
all
things
he
said
and
that
is
as
true
of
you
as
of
us
o
indeed
i
said
what
a
wonderful
thing
and
what
a
great
blessing
and
do
all
other
men
know
all
things
or
nothing
certainly
he
replied
they
can
not
know
some
things
and
not
know
others
and
be
at
the
same
time
knowing
and
not
knowing
then
what
is
the
inference
i
said
they
all
know
all
things
he
replied
if
they
know
one
thing
o
heavens
dionysodorus
i
said
i
see
now
that
you
are
in
earnest
hardly
have
i
got
you
to
that
point
and
do
you
really
and
truly
know
all
things
including
carpentering
and
certainly
he
said
and
do
you
know
stitching
yes
by
the
gods
we
do
and
cobbling
too
and
do
you
know
things
such
as
the
numbers
of
the
stars
and
of
the
sand
certainly
did
you
think
we
should
say
no
to
that
by
zeus
said
ctesippus
interrupting
i
only
wish
that
you
would
give
me
some
proof
which
would
enable
me
to
know
whether
you
speak
truly
what
proof
shall
i
give
you
he
said
will
you
tell
me
how
many
teeth
euthydemus
has
and
euthydemus
shall
tell
how
many
teeth
you
have
will
you
not
take
our
word
that
we
know
all
things
certainly
not
said
ctesippus
you
must
further
tell
us
this
one
thing
and
then
we
shall
know
that
you
are
speak
the
truth
if
you
tell
us
the
number
and
we
count
them
and
you
are
found
to
be
right
we
will
believe
the
rest
they
fancied
that
ctesippus
was
making
game
of
them
and
they
refused
and
they
would
only
say
in
answer
to
each
of
his
questions
that
they
knew
all
things
for
at
last
ctesippus
began
to
throw
off
all
restraint
no
question
in
fact
was
too
bad
for
him
he
would
ask
them
if
they
knew
the
foulest
things
and
they
like
wild
boars
came
rushing
on
his
blows
and
fearlessly
replied
that
they
did
at
last
crito
i
too
was
carried
away
by
my
incredulity
and
asked
euthydemus
whether
dionysodorus
could
dance
certainly
he
replied
and
can
he
vault
among
swords
and
turn
upon
a
wheel
at
his
age
has
he
got
to
such
a
height
of
skill
as
that
he
can
do
anything
he
said
and
did
you
always
know
this
always
he
said
when
you
were
children
and
at
your
birth
they
both
said
that
they
did
this
we
could
not
believe
and
euthydemus
said
you
are
incredulous
socrates
yes
i
said
and
i
might
well
be
incredulous
if
i
did
not
know
you
to
be
wise
men
but
if
you
will
answer
he
said
i
will
make
you
confess
to
similar
marvels
well
i
said
there
is
nothing
that
i
should
like
better
than
to
be
of
this
for
if
i
am
really
a
wise
man
which
i
never
knew
before
and
you
will
prove
to
me
that
i
know
and
have
always
known
all
things
nothing
in
life
would
be
a
greater
gain
to
me
answer
then
he
said
ask
i
said
and
i
will
answer
do
you
know
something
socrates
or
nothing
something
i
said
and
do
you
know
with
what
you
know
or
with
something
else
with
what
i
know
and
i
suppose
that
you
mean
with
my
soul
are
you
not
ashamed
socrates
of
asking
a
question
when
you
are
asked
one
well
i
said
but
then
what
am
i
to
do
for
i
will
do
whatever
you
bid
when
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
asking
you
tell
me
to
answer
nevertheless
and
not
to
ask
again
why
you
surely
have
some
notion
of
my
meaning
he
said
yes
i
replied
well
then
answer
according
to
your
notion
of
my
meaning
yes
i
said
but
if
the
question
which
you
ask
in
one
sense
is
understood
and
answered
by
me
in
another
will
that
please
you
if
i
answer
what
is
not
to
the
point
that
will
please
me
very
well
but
will
not
please
you
equally
well
as
i
imagine
i
certainly
will
not
answer
unless
i
understand
you
i
said
you
will
not
answer
he
said
according
to
your
view
of
the
meaning
because
you
will
be
prating
and
are
an
ancient
now
i
saw
that
he
was
getting
angry
with
me
for
drawing
distinctions
when
he
wanted
to
catch
me
in
his
springes
of
words
and
i
remembered
that
connus
was
always
angry
with
me
when
i
opposed
him
and
then
he
neglected
me
because
he
thought
that
i
was
stupid
and
as
i
was
intending
to
go
to
euthydemus
as
a
pupil
i
reflected
that
i
had
better
let
him
have
his
way
as
he
might
think
me
a
blockhead
and
refuse
to
take
me
so
i
said
you
are
a
far
better
dialectician
than
myself
euthydemus
for
i
have
never
made
a
profession
of
the
art
and
therefore
do
as
you
say
ask
your
questions
once
more
and
i
will
answer
answer
then
he
said
again
whether
you
know
what
you
know
with
something
or
with
nothing
yes
i
said
i
know
with
my
soul
the
man
will
answer
more
than
the
question
for
i
did
not
ask
you
he
said
with
what
you
know
but
whether
you
know
with
something
again
i
replied
through
ignorance
i
have
answered
too
much
but
i
hope
that
you
will
forgive
me
and
now
i
will
answer
simply
that
i
always
know
what
i
know
with
something
and
is
that
something
he
rejoined
always
the
same
or
sometimes
one
thing
and
sometimes
another
thing
always
i
replied
when
i
know
i
know
with
this
will
you
not
cease
adding
to
your
answers
my
fear
is
that
this
word
may
get
us
into
trouble
you
perhaps
but
certainly
not
us
and
now
answer
do
you
always
know
with
this
always
since
i
am
required
to
withdraw
the
words
i
know
you
always
know
with
this
or
always
knowing
do
you
know
some
things
with
this
and
some
things
with
something
else
or
do
you
know
all
things
with
this
all
that
i
know
i
replied
i
know
with
this
there
again
socrates
he
said
the
addition
is
superfluous
well
then
i
said
i
will
take
away
the
words
i
know
nay
take
nothing
away
i
desire
no
favours
of
you
but
let
me
ask
would
you
be
able
to
know
all
things
if
you
did
not
know
all
things
quite
impossible
and
now
he
said
you
may
add
on
whatever
you
like
for
you
confess
that
you
know
all
things
i
suppose
that
is
true
i
said
if
my
qualification
implied
in
the
words
i
know
is
not
allowed
to
stand
and
so
i
do
know
all
things
and
have
you
not
admitted
that
you
always
know
all
things
with
that
which
you
know
whether
you
make
the
addition
of
you
know
or
not
for
you
have
acknowledged
that
you
have
always
and
at
once
known
all
things
that
is
to
say
when
you
were
a
child
and
at
your
birth
and
when
you
were
growing
up
and
before
you
were
born
and
before
the
heaven
and
earth
existed
you
knew
all
things
if
you
always
know
them
and
i
swear
that
you
shall
always
continue
to
know
all
things
if
i
am
of
the
mind
to
make
you
but
i
hope
that
you
will
be
of
that
mind
reverend
euthydemus
i
said
if
you
are
really
speaking
the
truth
and
yet
i
a
little
doubt
your
power
to
make
good
your
words
unless
you
have
the
help
of
your
brother
dionysodorus
then
you
may
do
it
tell
me
now
both
of
you
for
although
in
the
main
i
can
not
doubt
that
i
really
do
know
all
things
when
i
am
told
so
by
men
of
your
prodigious
wisdom
how
can
i
say
that
i
know
such
things
euthydemus
as
that
the
good
are
unjust
come
do
i
know
that
or
not
certainly
you
know
that
what
do
i
know
that
the
good
are
not
unjust
quite
true
i
said
and
that
i
have
always
known
but
the
question
is
where
did
i
learn
that
the
good
are
unjust
nowhere
said
dionysodorus
then
i
said
i
do
not
know
this
you
are
ruining
the
argument
said
euthydemus
to
dionysodorus
he
will
be
proved
not
to
know
and
then
after
all
he
will
be
knowing
and
not
knowing
at
the
same
time
dionysodorus
blushed
i
turned
to
the
other
and
said
what
do
you
think
euthydemus
does
not
your
omniscient
brother
appear
to
you
to
have
made
a
mistake
what
replied
dionysodorus
in
a
moment
am
i
the
brother
of
euthydemus
thereupon
i
said
please
not
to
interrupt
my
good
friend
or
prevent
euthydemus
from
proving
to
me
that
i
know
the
good
to
be
unjust
such
a
lesson
you
might
at
least
allow
me
to
learn
you
are
running
away
socrates
said
dionysodorus
and
refusing
to
answer
no
wonder
i
said
for
i
am
not
a
match
for
one
of
you
and
a
fortiori
i
must
run
away
from
two
i
am
no
heracles
and
even
heracles
could
not
fight
against
the
hydra
who
was
a
and
had
the
wit
to
shoot
up
many
new
heads
when
one
of
them
was
cut
off
especially
when
he
saw
a
second
monster
of
a
who
was
also
a
sophist
and
appeared
to
have
newly
arrived
from
a
bearing
down
upon
him
from
the
left
opening
his
mouth
and
biting
when
the
monster
was
growing
troublesome
he
called
iolaus
his
nephew
to
his
help
who
ably
succoured
him
but
if
my
iolaus
who
is
my
brother
patrocles
the
statuary
were
to
come
he
would
only
make
a
bad
business
worse
and
now
that
you
have
delivered
yourself
of
this
strain
said
dionysodorus
will
you
inform
me
whether
iolaus
was
the
nephew
of
heracles
any
more
than
he
is
yours
i
suppose
that
i
had
best
answer
you
dionysodorus
i
said
for
you
will
insist
on
asking
that
i
pretty
well
know
out
of
envy
in
order
to
prevent
me
from
learning
the
wisdom
of
euthydemus
then
answer
me
he
said
well
then
i
said
i
can
only
reply
that
iolaus
was
not
my
nephew
at
all
but
the
nephew
of
heracles
and
his
father
was
not
my
brother
patrocles
but
iphicles
who
has
a
name
rather
like
his
and
was
the
brother
of
heracles
and
is
patrocles
he
said
your
brother
yes
i
said
he
is
my
the
son
of
my
mother
but
not
of
my
father
then
he
is
and
is
not
your
brother
not
by
the
same
father
my
good
man
i
said
for
chaeredemus
was
his
father
and
mine
was
sophroniscus
and
was
sophroniscus
a
father
and
chaeredemus
also
yes
i
said
the
former
was
my
father
and
the
latter
his
then
he
said
chaeredemus
is
not
a
father
he
is
not
my
father
i
said
but
can
a
father
be
other
than
a
father
or
are
you
the
same
as
a
stone
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
i
am
a
stone
i
said
though
i
am
afraid
that
you
may
prove
me
to
be
one
are
you
not
other
than
a
stone
i
am
and
being
other
than
a
stone
you
are
not
a
stone
and
being
other
than
gold
you
are
not
gold
very
true
and
so
chaeredemus
he
said
being
other
than
a
father
is
not
a
father
i
suppose
that
he
is
not
a
father
i
replied
for
if
said
euthydemus
taking
up
the
argument
chaeredemus
is
a
father
then
sophroniscus
being
other
than
a
father
is
not
a
father
and
you
socrates
are
without
a
father
ctesippus
here
taking
up
the
argument
said
and
is
not
your
father
in
the
same
case
for
he
is
other
than
my
father
assuredly
not
said
euthydemus
then
he
is
the
same
he
is
the
same
i
can
not
say
that
i
like
the
connection
but
is
he
only
my
father
euthydemus
or
is
he
the
father
of
all
other
men
of
all
other
men
he
replied
do
you
suppose
the
same
person
to
be
a
father
and
not
a
father
certainly
i
did
so
imagine
said
ctesippus
and
do
you
suppose
that
gold
is
not
gold
or
that
a
man
is
not
a
man
they
are
not
pari
materia
euthydemus
said
ctesippus
and
you
had
better
take
care
for
it
is
monstrous
to
suppose
that
your
father
is
the
father
of
all
but
he
is
he
replied
what
of
men
only
said
ctesippus
or
of
horses
and
of
all
other
animals
of
all
he
said
and
your
mother
too
is
the
mother
of
all
yes
our
mother
too
yes
and
your
mother
has
a
progeny
of
then
yes
and
yours
he
said
and
gudgeons
and
puppies
and
pigs
are
your
brothers
and
yours
too
and
your
papa
is
a
dog
and
so
is
yours
he
said
if
you
will
answer
my
questions
said
dionysodorus
i
will
soon
extract
the
same
admissions
from
you
ctesippus
you
say
that
you
have
a
dog
yes
a
villain
of
a
one
said
ctesippus
and
he
has
puppies
yes
and
they
are
very
like
himself
and
the
dog
is
the
father
of
them
yes
he
said
i
certainly
saw
him
and
the
mother
of
the
puppies
come
together
and
is
he
not
yours
to
be
sure
he
is
then
he
is
a
father
and
he
is
yours
ergo
he
is
your
father
and
the
puppies
are
your
brothers
let
me
ask
you
one
little
question
more
said
dionysodorus
quickly
interposing
in
order
that
ctesippus
might
not
get
in
his
word
you
beat
this
dog
ctesippus
said
laughing
indeed
i
do
and
i
only
wish
that
i
could
beat
you
instead
of
him
then
you
beat
your
father
he
said
i
should
have
far
more
reason
to
beat
yours
said
ctesippus
what
could
he
have
been
thinking
of
when
he
begat
such
wise
sons
much
good
has
this
father
of
you
and
your
brethren
the
puppies
got
out
of
this
wisdom
of
yours
but
neither
he
nor
you
ctesippus
have
any
need
of
much
good
and
have
you
no
need
euthydemus
he
said
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
for
tell
me
now
ctesippus
if
you
think
it
good
or
evil
for
a
man
who
is
sick
to
drink
medicine
when
he
wants
it
or
to
go
to
war
armed
rather
than
unarmed
good
i
say
and
yet
i
know
that
i
am
going
to
be
caught
in
one
of
your
charming
puzzles
that
he
replied
you
will
discover
if
you
answer
since
you
admit
medicine
to
be
good
for
a
man
to
drink
when
wanted
must
it
not
be
good
for
him
to
drink
as
much
as
possible
when
he
takes
his
medicine
a
cartload
of
hellebore
will
not
be
too
much
for
him
ctesippus
said
quite
so
euthydemus
that
is
to
say
if
he
who
drinks
is
as
big
as
the
statue
of
delphi
and
seeing
that
in
war
to
have
arms
is
a
good
thing
he
ought
to
have
as
many
spears
and
shields
as
possible
very
true
said
ctesippus
and
do
you
think
euthydemus
that
he
ought
to
have
one
shield
only
and
one
spear
i
do
and
would
you
arm
geryon
and
briareus
in
that
way
considering
that
you
and
your
companion
fight
in
armour
i
thought
that
you
would
have
known
better
here
euthydemus
held
his
peace
but
dionysodorus
returned
to
the
previous
answer
of
ctesippus
and
said
do
you
not
think
that
the
possession
of
gold
is
a
good
thing
yes
said
ctesippus
and
the
more
the
better
and
to
have
money
everywhere
and
always
is
a
good
certainly
a
great
good
he
said
and
you
admit
gold
to
be
a
good
certainly
he
replied
and
ought
not
a
man
then
to
have
gold
everywhere
and
always
and
as
much
as
possible
in
himself
and
may
he
not
be
deemed
the
happiest
of
men
who
has
three
talents
of
gold
in
his
belly
and
a
talent
in
his
pate
and
a
stater
of
gold
in
either
eye
yes
euthydemus
said
ctesippus
and
the
scythians
reckon
those
who
have
gold
in
their
own
skulls
to
be
the
happiest
and
bravest
of
men
that
is
only
another
instance
of
your
manner
of
speaking
about
the
dog
and
father
and
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
they
drink
out
of
their
own
skulls
gilt
and
see
the
inside
of
them
and
hold
their
own
head
in
their
hands
and
do
the
scythians
and
others
see
that
which
has
the
quality
of
vision
or
that
which
has
not
said
euthydemus
that
which
has
the
quality
of
vision
clearly
and
you
also
see
that
which
has
the
quality
of
vision
he
said
note
the
ambiguity
of
greek
visible
and
able
to
see
greek
speaking
of
the
silent
the
silent
denoting
either
the
speaker
or
the
subject
of
the
speech
can
not
be
perfectly
rendered
in
english
compare
aristot
soph
elenchi
poste
translation
ambiguous
propositions
the
following
are
instances
hope
that
you
the
enemy
may
slay
one
knows
he
knows
either
the
person
knowing
or
the
person
known
is
here
affirmed
to
know
one
sees
that
one
sees
one
sees
a
pillar
ergo
that
one
pillar
sees
you
are
holding
that
you
are
you
are
holding
a
stone
ergo
a
stone
you
are
a
speaking
of
the
silent
possible
the
silent
denotes
either
the
speaker
are
the
subject
of
speech
are
three
kinds
of
ambiguity
of
term
or
proposition
the
first
is
when
there
is
an
equal
linguistic
propriety
in
several
interpretations
the
second
when
one
is
improper
but
customary
the
third
when
the
ambiguity
arises
in
the
combination
of
elements
that
are
in
themselves
unambiguous
as
in
knowing
letters
knowing
and
letters
are
perhaps
separately
unambiguous
but
in
combination
may
imply
either
that
the
letters
are
known
or
that
they
themselves
have
knowledge
such
are
the
modes
in
which
propositions
and
terms
may
be
ambiguous
yes
i
do
then
do
you
see
our
garments
yes
then
our
garments
have
the
quality
of
vision
they
can
see
to
any
extent
said
ctesippus
what
can
they
see
nothing
but
you
my
sweet
man
may
perhaps
imagine
that
they
do
not
see
and
certainly
euthydemus
you
do
seem
to
me
to
have
been
caught
napping
when
you
were
not
asleep
and
that
if
it
be
possible
to
speak
and
say
nothing
you
are
doing
so
and
may
there
not
be
a
silence
of
the
speaker
said
dionysodorus
impossible
said
ctesippus
or
a
speaking
of
the
silent
that
is
still
more
impossible
he
said
but
when
you
speak
of
stones
wood
iron
bars
do
you
not
speak
of
the
silent
not
when
i
pass
a
smithy
for
then
the
iron
bars
make
a
tremendous
noise
and
outcry
if
they
are
touched
so
that
here
your
wisdom
is
strangely
mistaken
please
however
to
tell
me
how
you
can
be
silent
when
speaking
i
thought
that
ctesippus
was
put
upon
his
mettle
because
cleinias
was
present
when
you
are
silent
said
euthydemus
is
there
not
a
silence
of
all
things
yes
he
said
but
if
speaking
things
are
included
in
all
things
then
the
speaking
are
silent
what
said
ctesippus
then
all
things
are
not
silent
certainly
not
said
euthydemus
then
my
good
friend
do
they
all
speak
yes
those
which
speak
nay
said
ctesippus
but
the
question
which
i
ask
is
whether
all
things
are
silent
or
speak
neither
and
both
said
dionysodorus
quickly
interposing
i
am
sure
that
you
will
be
at
that
answer
here
ctesippus
as
his
manner
was
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
he
said
that
brother
of
yours
euthydemus
has
got
into
a
dilemma
all
is
over
with
him
this
delighted
cleinias
whose
laughter
made
ctesippus
ten
times
as
uproarious
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
rogue
must
have
picked
up
this
answer
from
them
for
there
has
been
no
wisdom
like
theirs
in
our
time
why
do
you
laugh
cleinias
i
said
at
such
solemn
and
beautiful
things
why
socrates
said
dionysodorus
did
you
ever
see
a
beautiful
thing
yes
dionysodorus
i
replied
i
have
seen
many
were
they
other
than
the
beautiful
or
the
same
as
the
beautiful
now
i
was
in
a
great
quandary
at
having
to
answer
this
question
and
i
thought
that
i
was
rightly
served
for
having
opened
my
mouth
at
all
i
said
however
they
are
not
the
same
as
absolute
beauty
but
they
have
beauty
present
with
each
of
them
and
are
you
an
ox
because
an
ox
is
present
with
you
or
are
you
dionysodorus
because
dionysodorus
is
present
with
you
god
forbid
i
replied
but
how
he
said
by
reason
of
one
thing
being
present
with
another
will
one
thing
be
another
is
that
your
difficulty
i
said
for
i
was
beginning
to
imitate
their
skill
on
which
my
heart
was
set
of
course
he
replied
i
and
all
the
world
are
in
a
difficulty
about
the
what
do
you
mean
dionysodorus
i
said
is
not
the
honourable
honourable
and
the
base
base
that
he
said
is
as
i
please
and
do
you
please
yes
he
said
and
you
will
admit
that
the
same
is
the
same
and
the
other
other
for
surely
the
other
is
not
the
same
i
should
imagine
that
even
a
child
will
hardly
deny
the
other
to
be
other
but
i
think
dionysodorus
that
you
must
have
intentionally
missed
the
last
question
for
in
general
you
and
your
brother
seem
to
me
to
be
good
workmen
in
your
own
department
and
to
do
the
dialectician
business
excellently
well
what
said
he
is
the
business
of
a
good
workman
tell
me
in
the
first
place
whose
business
is
hammering
the
smith
and
whose
the
making
of
pots
the
potter
and
who
has
to
kill
and
skin
and
mince
and
boil
and
roast
the
cook
i
said
and
if
a
man
does
his
business
he
does
rightly
certainly
and
the
business
of
the
cook
is
to
cut
up
and
skin
you
have
admitted
that
yes
i
have
admitted
that
but
you
must
not
be
too
hard
upon
me
then
if
some
one
were
to
kill
mince
boil
roast
the
cook
he
would
do
his
business
and
if
he
were
to
hammer
the
smith
and
make
a
pot
of
the
potter
he
would
do
their
business
poseidon
i
said
this
is
the
crown
of
wisdom
can
i
ever
hope
to
have
such
wisdom
of
my
own
and
would
you
be
able
socrates
to
recognize
this
wisdom
when
it
has
become
your
own
certainly
i
said
if
you
will
allow
me
what
he
said
do
you
think
that
you
know
what
is
your
own
yes
i
do
subject
to
your
correction
for
you
are
the
bottom
and
euthydemus
is
the
top
of
all
my
wisdom
is
not
that
which
you
would
deem
your
own
he
said
that
which
you
have
in
your
own
power
and
which
you
are
able
to
use
as
you
would
desire
for
example
an
ox
or
a
sheep
would
you
not
think
that
which
you
could
sell
and
give
and
sacrifice
to
any
god
whom
you
pleased
to
be
your
own
and
that
which
you
could
not
give
or
sell
or
sacrifice
you
would
think
not
to
be
in
your
own
power
yes
i
said
for
i
was
certain
that
something
good
would
come
out
of
the
questions
which
i
was
impatient
to
hear
yes
such
things
and
such
things
only
are
mine
yes
he
said
and
you
would
mean
by
animals
living
beings
yes
i
said
you
agree
then
that
those
animals
only
are
yours
with
which
you
have
the
power
to
do
all
these
things
which
i
was
just
naming
i
agree
then
after
a
pause
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
something
great
he
said
tell
me
socrates
have
you
an
ancestral
zeus
here
anticipating
the
final
move
like
a
person
caught
in
a
net
who
gives
a
desperate
twist
that
he
may
get
away
i
said
no
dionysodorus
i
have
not
what
a
miserable
man
you
must
be
then
he
said
you
are
not
an
athenian
at
all
if
you
have
no
ancestral
gods
or
temples
or
any
other
mark
of
gentility
nay
dionysodorus
i
said
do
not
be
rough
good
words
if
you
please
in
the
way
of
religion
i
have
altars
and
temples
domestic
and
ancestral
and
all
that
other
athenians
have
and
have
not
other
athenians
he
said
an
ancestral
zeus
that
name
i
said
is
not
to
be
found
among
the
ionians
whether
colonists
or
citizens
of
athens
an
ancestral
apollo
there
is
who
is
the
father
of
ion
and
a
family
zeus
and
a
zeus
guardian
of
the
phratry
and
an
athene
guardian
of
the
phratry
but
the
name
of
ancestral
zeus
is
unknown
to
us
no
matter
said
dionysodorus
for
you
admit
that
you
have
apollo
zeus
and
athene
certainly
i
said
and
they
are
your
gods
he
said
yes
i
said
my
lords
and
ancestors
at
any
rate
they
are
yours
he
said
did
you
not
admit
that
i
did
i
said
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
and
are
not
these
gods
animals
for
you
admit
that
all
things
which
have
life
are
animals
and
have
not
these
gods
life
they
have
life
i
said
then
are
they
not
animals
they
are
animals
i
said
and
you
admitted
that
of
animals
those
are
yours
which
you
could
give
away
or
sell
or
offer
in
sacrifice
as
you
pleased
i
did
admit
that
euthydemus
and
i
have
no
way
of
escape
well
then
said
he
if
you
admit
that
zeus
and
the
other
gods
are
yours
can
you
sell
them
or
give
them
away
or
do
what
you
will
with
them
as
you
would
with
other
animals
at
this
i
was
quite
struck
dumb
crito
and
lay
prostrate
ctesippus
came
to
the
rescue
bravo
heracles
brave
words
said
he
bravo
heracles
or
is
heracles
a
bravo
said
dionysodorus
poseidon
said
ctesippus
what
awful
distinctions
i
will
have
no
more
of
them
the
pair
are
invincible
then
my
dear
crito
there
was
universal
applause
of
the
speakers
and
their
words
and
what
with
laughing
and
clapping
of
hands
and
rejoicings
the
two
men
were
quite
overpowered
for
hitherto
their
partisans
only
had
cheered
at
each
successive
hit
but
now
the
whole
company
shouted
with
delight
until
the
columns
of
the
lyceum
returned
the
sound
seeming
to
sympathize
in
their
joy
to
such
a
pitch
was
i
affected
myself
that
i
made
a
speech
in
which
i
acknowledged
that
i
had
never
seen
the
like
of
their
wisdom
i
was
their
devoted
servant
and
fell
to
praising
and
admiring
of
them
what
marvellous
dexterity
of
wit
i
said
enabled
you
to
acquire
this
great
perfection
in
such
a
short
time
there
is
much
indeed
to
admire
in
your
words
euthydemus
and
dionysodorus
but
there
is
nothing
that
i
admire
more
than
your
magnanimous
disregard
of
any
opinion
whether
of
the
many
or
of
the
grave
and
reverend
seigniors
you
regard
only
those
who
are
like
yourselves
and
i
do
verily
believe
that
there
are
few
who
are
like
you
and
who
would
approve
of
such
arguments
the
majority
of
mankind
are
so
ignorant
of
their
value
that
they
would
be
more
ashamed
of
employing
them
in
the
refutation
of
others
than
of
being
refuted
by
them
i
must
further
express
my
approval
of
your
kind
and
denial
of
all
differences
whether
of
good
and
evil
white
or
black
or
any
other
the
result
of
which
is
that
as
you
say
every
mouth
is
sewn
up
not
excepting
your
own
which
graciously
follows
the
example
of
others
and
thus
all
ground
of
offence
is
taken
away
but
what
appears
to
me
to
be
more
than
all
is
that
this
art
and
invention
of
yours
has
been
so
admirably
contrived
by
you
that
in
a
very
short
time
it
can
be
imparted
to
any
one
i
observed
that
ctesippus
learned
to
imitate
you
in
no
time
now
this
quickness
of
attainment
is
an
excellent
thing
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
advise
you
not
to
have
any
more
public
entertainments
there
is
a
danger
that
men
may
undervalue
an
art
which
they
have
so
easy
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
the
exhibition
would
be
best
of
all
if
the
discussion
were
confined
to
your
two
selves
but
if
there
must
be
an
audience
let
him
only
be
present
who
is
willing
to
pay
a
handsome
fee
you
should
be
careful
of
this
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
also
bid
your
disciples
discourse
with
no
man
but
you
and
themselves
for
only
what
is
rare
is
valuable
and
which
as
pindar
says
is
the
of
all
things
is
also
the
cheapest
and
now
i
have
only
to
request
that
you
will
receive
cleinias
and
me
among
your
pupils
such
was
the
discussion
crito
and
after
a
few
more
words
had
passed
between
us
we
went
away
i
hope
that
you
will
come
to
them
with
me
since
they
say
that
they
are
able
to
teach
any
one
who
will
give
them
money
no
age
or
want
of
capacity
is
an
impediment
and
i
must
repeat
one
thing
which
they
said
for
your
especial
benefit
that
the
learning
of
their
art
did
not
at
all
interfere
with
the
business
of
crito
truly
socrates
though
i
am
curious
and
ready
to
learn
yet
i
fear
that
i
am
not
with
euthydemus
but
one
of
the
other
sort
who
as
you
were
saying
would
rather
be
refuted
by
such
arguments
than
use
them
in
refutation
of
others
and
though
i
may
appear
ridiculous
in
venturing
to
advise
you
i
think
that
you
may
as
well
hear
what
was
said
to
me
by
a
man
of
very
considerable
pretensions
he
was
a
professor
of
legal
oratory
who
came
away
from
you
while
i
was
walking
up
and
down
said
he
to
me
you
giving
no
attention
to
these
wise
men
indeed
i
said
to
him
could
not
get
within
hearing
of
them
there
was
such
a
crowd
would
have
heard
something
worth
hearing
if
you
had
was
that
i
said
would
have
heard
the
greatest
masters
of
the
art
of
rhetoric
discoursing
what
did
you
think
of
them
i
said
did
i
think
of
them
he
said
was
the
sort
of
discourse
which
anybody
might
hear
from
men
who
were
playing
the
fool
and
making
much
ado
about
nothing
that
was
the
expression
which
he
used
i
said
is
a
charming
thing
he
said
simplicity
philosophy
is
nought
and
i
think
that
if
you
had
been
present
you
would
have
been
ashamed
of
your
friend
his
conduct
was
so
very
strange
in
placing
himself
at
the
mercy
of
men
who
care
not
what
they
say
and
fasten
upon
every
word
and
these
as
i
was
telling
you
are
supposed
to
be
the
most
eminent
professors
of
their
time
but
the
truth
is
crito
that
the
study
itself
and
the
men
themselves
are
utterly
mean
and
ridiculous
now
censure
of
the
pursuit
socrates
whether
coming
from
him
or
from
others
appears
to
me
to
be
undeserved
but
as
to
the
impropriety
of
holding
a
public
discussion
with
such
men
there
i
confess
that
in
my
opinion
he
was
in
the
right
socrates
o
crito
they
are
marvellous
men
but
what
was
i
going
to
say
first
of
all
let
me
know
what
manner
of
man
was
he
who
came
up
to
you
and
censured
philosophy
was
he
an
orator
who
himself
practises
in
the
courts
or
an
instructor
of
orators
who
makes
the
speeches
with
which
they
do
battle
crito
he
was
certainly
not
an
orator
and
i
doubt
whether
he
had
ever
been
into
court
but
they
say
that
he
knows
the
business
and
is
a
clever
man
and
composes
wonderful
speeches
socrates
now
i
understand
crito
he
is
one
of
an
amphibious
class
whom
i
was
on
the
point
of
mentioning
one
of
those
whom
prodicus
describes
as
on
the
between
philosophers
and
statesmen
they
think
that
they
are
the
wisest
of
all
men
and
that
they
are
generally
esteemed
the
wisest
nothing
but
the
rivalry
of
the
philosophers
stands
in
their
way
and
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
if
they
can
prove
the
philosophers
to
be
good
for
nothing
no
one
will
dispute
their
title
to
the
palm
of
wisdom
for
that
they
are
themselves
really
the
wisest
although
they
are
apt
to
be
mauled
by
euthydemus
and
his
friends
when
they
get
hold
of
them
in
conversation
this
opinion
which
they
entertain
of
their
own
wisdom
is
very
natural
for
they
have
a
certain
amount
of
philosophy
and
a
certain
amount
of
political
wisdom
there
is
reason
in
what
they
say
for
they
argue
that
they
have
just
enough
of
both
and
so
they
keep
out
of
the
way
of
all
risks
and
conflicts
and
reap
the
fruits
of
their
wisdom
crito
what
do
you
say
of
them
socrates
there
is
certainly
something
specious
in
that
notion
of
theirs
socrates
yes
crito
there
is
more
speciousness
than
truth
they
can
not
be
made
to
understand
the
nature
of
intermediates
for
all
persons
or
things
which
are
intermediate
between
two
other
things
and
participate
in
both
of
them
if
one
of
these
two
things
is
good
and
the
other
evil
are
better
than
the
one
and
worse
than
the
other
but
if
they
are
in
a
mean
between
two
good
things
which
do
not
tend
to
the
same
end
they
fall
short
of
either
of
their
component
elements
in
the
attainment
of
their
ends
only
in
the
case
when
the
two
component
elements
which
do
not
tend
to
the
same
end
are
evil
is
the
participant
better
than
either
now
if
philosophy
and
political
action
are
both
good
but
tend
to
different
ends
and
they
participate
in
both
and
are
in
a
mean
between
them
then
they
are
talking
nonsense
for
they
are
worse
than
either
or
if
the
one
be
good
and
the
other
evil
they
are
better
than
the
one
and
worse
than
the
other
only
on
the
supposition
that
they
are
both
evil
could
there
be
any
truth
in
what
they
say
i
do
not
think
that
they
will
admit
that
their
two
pursuits
are
either
wholly
or
partly
evil
but
the
truth
is
that
these
who
aim
at
both
fall
short
of
both
in
the
attainment
of
their
respective
ends
and
are
really
third
although
they
would
like
to
stand
first
there
is
no
need
however
to
be
angry
at
this
ambition
of
theirs
which
may
be
forgiven
for
every
man
ought
to
be
loved
who
says
and
manfully
pursues
and
works
out
anything
which
is
at
all
like
wisdom
at
the
same
time
we
shall
do
well
to
see
them
as
they
really
are
crito
i
have
often
told
you
socrates
that
i
am
in
a
constant
difficulty
about
my
two
sons
what
am
i
to
do
with
them
there
is
no
hurry
about
the
younger
one
who
is
only
a
child
but
the
other
critobulus
is
getting
on
and
needs
some
one
who
will
improve
him
i
can
not
help
thinking
when
i
hear
you
talk
that
there
is
a
sort
of
madness
in
many
of
our
anxieties
about
our
children
in
the
first
place
about
marrying
a
wife
of
good
family
to
be
the
mother
of
them
and
then
about
heaping
up
money
for
them
and
yet
taking
no
care
about
their
education
but
then
again
when
i
contemplate
any
of
those
who
pretend
to
educate
others
i
am
amazed
to
me
if
i
am
to
confess
the
truth
they
all
seem
to
be
such
outrageous
beings
so
that
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
advise
the
youth
to
study
philosophy
socrates
dear
crito
do
you
not
know
that
in
every
profession
the
inferior
sort
are
numerous
and
good
for
nothing
and
the
good
are
few
and
beyond
all
price
for
example
are
not
gymnastic
and
rhetoric
and
and
the
art
of
the
general
noble
arts
crito
certainly
they
are
in
my
judgment
socrates
well
and
do
you
not
see
that
in
each
of
these
arts
the
many
are
ridiculous
performers
crito
yes
indeed
that
is
very
true
socrates
and
will
you
on
this
account
shun
all
these
pursuits
yourself
and
refuse
to
allow
them
to
your
son
crito
that
would
not
be
reasonable
socrates
socrates
do
you
then
be
reasonable
crito
and
do
not
mind
whether
the
teachers
of
philosophy
are
good
or
bad
but
think
only
of
philosophy
herself
try
and
examine
her
well
and
truly
and
if
she
be
evil
seek
to
turn
away
all
men
from
her
and
not
your
sons
only
but
if
she
be
what
i
believe
that
she
is
then
follow
her
and
serve
her
you
and
your
house
as
the
saying
is
and
be
of
good
cheer
